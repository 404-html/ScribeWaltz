1
00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:04.853
Yeah,

2
00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:08.690
<v 1>that's a good fucking book.
Dude.
Did a great job with this thing.
Oh thanks man.</v>

3
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.090
It was a lot of work,
I would imagine.
I don't know.

4
00:00:11.091 --> 00:00:15.580
How the hell are you have the time.
Where do you see volume two?

5
00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:21.230
We live.
So tell me how the fuck do you have the time to do this?

6
00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.320
I'm looking at this book,
the complete guide to hunting,

7
00:00:24.321 --> 00:00:27.320
butchering and cooking wild game.
Steve Ronell's here,
ladies and Gentlemen,

8
00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.870
Ladies and gentlemen,
Steven Noah put on my fucking media.
Oh,
I like that.

9
00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:35.590
Like that.
I was 40.
How do you have the time to do this book?
You know?

10
00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.790
<v 2>Well,
I got into doing the book.
Um,</v>

11
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.160
that was a great opening to the show by the way.
Thank you very much.

12
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.800
When I started doing that book,
I thought I'd take eight months,
man.
Ah,

13
00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:51.750
we just got on this idea that,
you know,
I wanted to do as,

14
00:00:51.751 --> 00:00:54.750
I wanted to do a book about a field care and butchering and stuff,

15
00:00:54.751 --> 00:00:55.920
but then some of the studies should be bigger.

16
00:00:55.921 --> 00:00:59.430
It should be like the complete guide or we started using the word complete and

17
00:00:59.431 --> 00:01:02.520
what I keep saying now is how I should add it for long time.

18
00:01:02.521 --> 00:01:07.521
I really regretted including the word complete in the proposal because as we sat

19
00:01:08.161 --> 00:01:12.780
down
initially I would sit down with with Dodi who you know,

20
00:01:12.781 --> 00:01:15.360
well Dan Dodi and we would just start mapping out,

21
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.100
<v 0>okay</v>

22
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.720
<v 2>we had like a board,
you know,</v>

23
00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.680
and sticky notes and we just start mapping out like what were complete look
like.

24
00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.360
And then it grew and grew and already,
you know,

25
00:01:27.361 --> 00:01:30.450
he was working on the show and moved on to some other things.

26
00:01:30.451 --> 00:01:35.130
It's still was involved and other guys came in and Yannis,
you know,

27
00:01:35.131 --> 00:01:39.720
we start working on it and just trying to manage the idea and pretty soon,

28
00:01:39.721 --> 00:01:43.410
I mean a lot of people worked on that book.
Um,
but yeah,

29
00:01:43.411 --> 00:01:47.790
I mean I was in there on the writing process and it turned into several,

30
00:01:47.791 --> 00:01:50.880
it took several years to do them.
Then when I took it to my publisher,

31
00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.140
she had me in its published by Spiegel and Grau at random house and she had me

32
00:01:57.301 --> 00:01:59.910
into the office and we had turned it in.

33
00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.200
It was going to be 700 and some pages long.
And she said like,

34
00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.160
it's just,
books aren't like,
you just don't really,
you know,

35
00:02:08.161 --> 00:02:11.630
you got to understand like that's a big book.
Yeah.

36
00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.930
You don't really do illustrated books that big.
Um,

37
00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.860
so we were going to hack a bunch out but then we kind of hit on this idea just

38
00:02:19.861 --> 00:02:23.490
to polish it and two things as volume one and volume two.

39
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.720
But it wasn't just as simple as splitting it down the middle.
So,

40
00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.740
uh,
it took probably another,
I don't know,

41
00:02:31.741 --> 00:02:36.510
almost a year maybe to,
to turn it into volume one big game,

42
00:02:36.511 --> 00:02:38.290
volume two small game.
That's awesome.

43
00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:39.380
<v 1>Big Effort,
man.</v>

44
00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.500
I know how much you work and how much you travel and how many hunts you go on.

45
00:02:44.631 --> 00:02:47.420
And I don't just know how the fuck you did it.

46
00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.070
<v 2>I've ever been down.
We were down in,
uh,
I was down in a fan with my family,</v>

47
00:02:51.071 --> 00:02:55.210
just vacation in Baja and I remember sitting there and we were fishing and stuff

48
00:02:55.211 --> 00:02:58.810
and we had two babies with us.

49
00:02:58.811 --> 00:03:01.540
And I'm sitting there trying to like work on that book.

50
00:03:01.541 --> 00:03:04.750
I just worked on all the time.
But,
but the thing is I don't want it,

51
00:03:04.751 --> 00:03:07.510
like I did a lot of work on it,
but everybody,
a lot of the guys,
you know,

52
00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.310
worked on it a ton too,
you know,
like all that recipe stuff.
Um,

53
00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.860
you know,
Dodie like we did a big shoot,

54
00:03:15.861 --> 00:03:19.750
dirty kind of organizes she with some other folks and like we organized a week

55
00:03:19.751 --> 00:03:21.520
of just cooking and photographing.

56
00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.540
But the other thing is a lot of this stuff in there too,
the images,

57
00:03:25.541 --> 00:03:26.830
you'd kind of look at the image,
you'd be like,

58
00:03:26.831 --> 00:03:28.600
well how would you go and get all these images?

59
00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.010
You'd never be able to justify getting those images to make a book.
But we had,

60
00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:37.980
uh,
access to so many hours of hunting footage of all this stuff.

61
00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:39.910
So we're able to do something called screen grabs.

62
00:03:39.911 --> 00:03:44.730
So in there is a lot of stuff where we're able to pull images to illustrate all

63
00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.290
these different procedures and stuff that,

64
00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.200
that you would just never go out and get those kinds of photographs.

65
00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.470
He would have to kill a ton of animal,
like really expensive.

66
00:03:53.471 --> 00:03:57.460
But we were able to draw back and the advantage of film and hunts for so many

67
00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:00.460
years.
Now.
Is it anything you want to explain?

68
00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.640
We'd sit there and be like,
oh,
you know what to be perfect.

69
00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.670
And we just go in and pull stills out of images and put them right in the books

70
00:04:08.831 --> 00:04:12.370
we have.
It's like as you look at it as kind of,
you know,
it's beautiful.

71
00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:14.260
Another got a lot of the photography,

72
00:04:14.261 --> 00:04:16.540
like the stuff on the covers by this Guy John Haffner,

73
00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:19.370
who's a hunter and photographer.
Um,

74
00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:23.950
we became friends with John working it up and he opened up his vast library of

75
00:04:23.951 --> 00:04:28.900
wildlife imagery,
um,
just gave us kind of like the keys to his whole catalog.

76
00:04:28.901 --> 00:04:31.450
And so we had just to pick of some of the best stuff out there.

77
00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:36.460
But I'm real,
I'm real happy with it,
man.
I'm proud of it.
And,

78
00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.770
and uh,
I always tell people like,
if you get it,
there's,

79
00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:42.910
there's no way you're gonna be disappointed in it.

80
00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.110
<v 3>No,
it's excellent.
It's so comprehensive and it's the,</v>

81
00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:49.660
I don't know of any other book like it.
I mean,

82
00:04:49.661 --> 00:04:51.580
maybe there's one out there that's like it,
but it's,

83
00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.580
there's so much info and even if you're not into hunting,

84
00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.530
it's really fascinating the tactics and strategies and why you have to do

85
00:04:59.531 --> 00:05:03.100
certain things and,
and what's involved in,
in the,

86
00:05:03.101 --> 00:05:05.970
the pursuit and tracking the habitat of these animals,

87
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.620
why they live in these certain places.

88
00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.570
<v 2>We put a lot of legal stuff in there.
The next one,
that one's out,
the next one,</v>

89
00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:16.950
there's a small game.
One comes out in December.
But yeah,
they've been,

90
00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:20.010
they've been doing well man.
And we've heard great things about them.
Well,

91
00:05:20.011 --> 00:05:20.840
you've expanded

92
00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.640
<v 3>so much,
you know,
and uh,</v>

93
00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:27.470
when I first started talking to you is right after you got done doing the wild

94
00:05:27.471 --> 00:05:31.790
within and then you were starting meeting or at the time and now,
you know,

95
00:05:31.791 --> 00:05:36.620
I really think that the show has hit its stride in a crazy way like this.

96
00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:40.610
The first episode that I saw of this season was the one where you went hunting

97
00:05:40.611 --> 00:05:43.370
for coups dear and you didn't even kill anything and it was one of your best

98
00:05:43.371 --> 00:05:44.204
episodes.

99
00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:48.720
And it was just cause it was so much involved that it just,
it,

100
00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:51.710
it's not just a hunting show.
You know,

101
00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:56.060
like you were talking about your relationship with your father and how you would

102
00:05:56.061 --> 00:05:59.230
love to bring your to this plate.
You know,
your father's dead.

103
00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:00.650
You were talking about how,
you know,

104
00:06:00.651 --> 00:06:03.860
you have this tumultuous relationship with him and how you'd want to bring him

105
00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:07.970
to this place to see what this is like.
Cause it's so beautiful and that in,

106
00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:11.720
there's no music and you were just out there talking and it was like,
man,

107
00:06:11.721 --> 00:06:14.510
this is some really deep,
compelling shit.

108
00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:15.570
<v 2>Yeah.
We had no,</v>

109
00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:20.070
we had no intention of doing that show that way until later when the editor

110
00:06:20.071 --> 00:06:22.170
looked at it and you're not doing it,
there's no music.

111
00:06:22.171 --> 00:06:24.140
It's just like the sound of the wind.
It was awesome.

112
00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:27.390
It was my favorite episode is mine.
This is my favorite one we've ever done.

113
00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:31.560
And I was nervous at first.
Um,
because you know,
it's a,

114
00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:36.290
to do a hunt shamine you're working in a really traditional genre that does in

115
00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:41.300
many ways doesn't invite a lot of innovation or one might think it doesn't

116
00:06:41.311 --> 00:06:46.110
invite a lot of innovation.
You know,
you could get away with taking that,

117
00:06:46.111 --> 00:06:46.370
but,

118
00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:49.920
but anytime we've done something that really goes against the grain of what you

119
00:06:49.921 --> 00:06:51.360
picture is going to happen in a hunting show,

120
00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:55.920
it's like people that like to show,
I've always liked.

121
00:06:55.921 --> 00:06:59.880
It was like we can run shoulder.
No one gets anything.
You know,
when we're out,

122
00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:03.940
if we're out filming and no one gets anything [inaudible] we call them skunk.

123
00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:05.630
I get real nervous,
you know,

124
00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:09.630
I mean like I started getting real nervous from up from a production standpoint,

125
00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:14.040
but in the end,
man,
I think that people,
um,
that,

126
00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:18.420
that fans of the show are willing to go along with you on that if you're giving

127
00:07:18.421 --> 00:07:21.900
them something else instead.
Yeah.
You know?
Oh,
well you definitely did.

128
00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:26.080
We just filmed like,
we just filmed a dove hunt down in Virginia,
um,

129
00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:30.420
with my buddy Ronnie Bame,
who you met,
you know,

130
00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:35.790
the daily bag limit on doves is 15.
Right.
So it was me and Ronnie and other guy,

131
00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:40.500
we all limit out.
That's a tremendous amount of shooting,

132
00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:44.700
you know,
so then you kind of kill fest.
Yeah.

133
00:07:44.701 --> 00:07:47.790
So you're sort of thinking out of their five ounce birds,
but,

134
00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:52.050
and then you're sort of thinking like,
man,
this is going to be a great show,

135
00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:55.140
but it doesn't.
And that hope that it will be,

136
00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:58.030
but it doesn't necessarily mean that,
you know,
it's like,

137
00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:01.260
it's like having like getting stuff doesn't necessarily mean it's going to be

138
00:08:01.261 --> 00:08:03.210
great because you kind of,
there's always like,

139
00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:07.290
there's always a story hiding around down in there and what we're getting ready

140
00:08:07.291 --> 00:08:11.130
to go somewhere to film.
I'm always getting pressure

141
00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:17.250
in a friendly way from Yannis or from Dodi,
you know,
who are like,

142
00:08:17.251 --> 00:08:18.810
what's the story?
You know,
like what's the,

143
00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:22.830
and I just feel like I understand where they're coming from.

144
00:08:22.831 --> 00:08:24.810
Like is their job to,
to wonder about that stuff.

145
00:08:24.811 --> 00:08:27.540
But I always feel like you're just going to wind up responding to something that

146
00:08:27.541 --> 00:08:28.374
happens.

147
00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:31.690
<v 3>What I think is important about your show,</v>

148
00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:36.130
I think there's a lot of things important about you and what you represent in

149
00:08:36.131 --> 00:08:36.964
this world.

150
00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:40.990
But one of the things that I think is important in your show is if there's a lot

151
00:08:40.991 --> 00:08:42.190
of these shows,

152
00:08:42.191 --> 00:08:46.240
these hunting shows without mocking them or saying anything bad about them,

153
00:08:46.241 --> 00:08:48.930
but they,
they're very simple.
They're,

154
00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:51.490
they appeal to simple people.

155
00:08:51.491 --> 00:08:55.000
They have like this simple ideology that goes through them.

156
00:08:55.410 --> 00:09:00.410
And I think you get caught in that genre and everybody sort of starts thinking,

157
00:09:01.231 --> 00:09:02.970
well,
this is what the shows are about.

158
00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:07.650
These shows are all about like go sit in a tree stand and you know,
and when,

159
00:09:07.651 --> 00:09:08.081
when you,

160
00:09:08.081 --> 00:09:12.180
you shoot this animal that you named earlier in the spring and you got trail cam

161
00:09:12.181 --> 00:09:15.900
pictures of it,
I mean a lot of those shows are the same goddamn show every week.

162
00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:19.680
Yeah.
And it gets you,
you get it in your head,
oh,

163
00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:24.090
this is what a hunting show is and this is what hunting is.
And I think that's,

164
00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:27.750
it's a problem with the stereotype that people have with hunting.

165
00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:32.790
They connect hunting to sort of a,
like a low vibration of thinking,
you know,

166
00:09:32.791 --> 00:09:34.110
that.
Yeah.
You know what I mean?

167
00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:37.210
<v 2>There you're saying,
I don't know if it's you,
you being a,</v>

168
00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:40.400
a comedian or I noticed you guys always say calm.
It could be in a comic.

169
00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:44.870
I don't know.
I'm guessing you watch other guys.
Yes,
I could see,

170
00:09:44.871 --> 00:09:48.440
I could see in that world you probably would really want to watch other guys.

171
00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:51.710
I haven't found it helpful to watch hunting shows.
Um,

172
00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:55.370
I generally don't watch hunting shows,
um,

173
00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:58.270
because I don't want to wind up.
Um,

174
00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:03.770
I don't want to wind up having to stuff that I do be a response to that.
Right.

175
00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:06.050
You know,
I'm always afraid.
I'm always afraid of that,

176
00:10:06.051 --> 00:10:09.590
of like feeling like something would get in your head and even if you didn't

177
00:10:09.591 --> 00:10:13.790
intend to that you'd wind up responding to it,
you know?

178
00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.810
So I haven't watched a whole lot and I don't like to hack on it.

179
00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:19.100
I don't like the hack.

180
00:10:19.101 --> 00:10:21.930
I like people often invite me to like hack on hunting shows and,

181
00:10:21.931 --> 00:10:26.030
and I just don't,
there's some things I see a little bit that troubled me.

182
00:10:26.031 --> 00:10:30.890
Like some of the ways that female hunters are portrayed as like little sex

183
00:10:30.891 --> 00:10:34.760
dolls,
you know,
with the Mascara.
And it just doesn't feel like,

184
00:10:34.761 --> 00:10:38.000
when I think about my daughter growing up and going hunting,

185
00:10:38.001 --> 00:10:39.500
I just don't feel that that will,

186
00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:43.520
I don't want that to be how she finds her way into it as sort of like every

187
00:10:43.521 --> 00:10:48.260
man's fantasy.
That stuff bugs me a little bit.
But,
um,

188
00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:50.860
I haven't followed that help with a watch,
so I don't think of,

189
00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:55.820
I don't do like a reaction to what's going on.
I just try to make things that,

190
00:10:55.821 --> 00:10:58.550
uh,
to,
to show,

191
00:10:58.551 --> 00:11:02.900
just like the complex relationship I had with honey before I started doing this

192
00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:05.690
filming has definitely changed the way I think about hunting and,

193
00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:08.600
and in a way I try to react against that.

194
00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:12.380
I try to recatch like how I used to feel about going hunting when I wasn't

195
00:11:12.381 --> 00:11:17.060
having this production thing in my head about like making a show,
you know,

196
00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:18.040
be worried about making a show.

197
00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:23.920
<v 3>Well,
I think that it's,
it's,
it's the elephant in the room.
I mean,
how does,</v>

198
00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:27.580
how do you avoid thinking about it while you were out there and you're doing it,

199
00:11:27.581 --> 00:11:28.361
you have to consider,

200
00:11:28.361 --> 00:11:31.030
it's one of the episodes that you did your podcast recently we were talking

201
00:11:31.031 --> 00:11:34.480
about with Casey Casey live.
Yeah.
Well you were talking about,
uh,

202
00:11:34.481 --> 00:11:39.400
all the different aspects of putting together a show and that you kind of feel

203
00:11:39.401 --> 00:11:44.350
like sometimes that filming a show,
in a way,
it kind of,

204
00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:47.120
it's almost like prostituting it.
Yeah.

205
00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:49.030
<v 2>It makes me feel a little bit evil.</v>

206
00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:52.640
I feel evil for being involved in a,

207
00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:56.680
I feel a little bit evil for being involved in TV.

208
00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:01.950
<v 1>Partially that's also because your wife is into publishing and she wanted you to</v>

209
00:12:01.951 --> 00:12:04.860
stay within the world of book publishing is a very respected thing.

210
00:12:05.130 --> 00:12:09.210
Whereas TV especially like hunting shows or even reality shows,

211
00:12:09.211 --> 00:12:13.730
which was your first thing,
it's filled with bullshit and your nose.
Yeah.
Yeah.

212
00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:18.370
<v 2>So yeah,
when I feel a little bit embarrassed,
not,
not so much.</v>

213
00:12:18.371 --> 00:12:19.630
I mean obviously doing that,
and I,

214
00:12:19.631 --> 00:12:22.580
and I loved doing it and I fight to try to keep being able to do it,

215
00:12:22.581 --> 00:12:24.400
but it's like,
it's on the back of my hand.
Like I,
you know,

216
00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:28.620
I do carry that with me.
You know,
I do carry with me that I think of like,

217
00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:31.600
I think of TV as

218
00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:33.260
<v 0>okay.</v>

219
00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.300
<v 1>Yeah.
It's just as like,
uh,
it just,</v>

220
00:12:35.301 --> 00:12:38.070
it just something about it feels kind of bass man.
You know what I mean?
Well,

221
00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:41.300
I think a lot of that might have to do with your experience on your first show

222
00:12:41.301 --> 00:12:42.440
too.
They were trying to like,

223
00:12:42.590 --> 00:12:46.580
let it fucking moose out of a cage and you shoot it with a mosque.
It,
I mean,

224
00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:50.510
they were trying to pressure you into a lot of really stupid fake shit because

225
00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:54.630
they were operating under the guidelines of,
you know,

226
00:12:54.650 --> 00:12:56.840
quote unquote reality TV because that's how they do it.
What's,

227
00:12:56.841 --> 00:12:58.550
what's important to them is getting the shot.

228
00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:00.440
Not whether or not the shot actually happened.

229
00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:03.870
<v 2>I remember one time being in a meeting early on when we were starting to work on</v>

230
00:13:03.871 --> 00:13:04.930
that show.
And,
uh,

231
00:13:05.210 --> 00:13:10.210
a guy that I later became friends with and he still does those kind of reality

232
00:13:10.531 --> 00:13:14.100
type shows that come out of Alaska.
But he,
uh,

233
00:13:15.450 --> 00:13:18.600
he,
we were talking about how much time,
you know,
like,
I was ours,

234
00:13:18.610 --> 00:13:21.640
I really need more time,
need more time,
cause it fine and animals.
And He,

235
00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:23.910
and early on,
the first time we ever met,
he's like,
well,

236
00:13:23.911 --> 00:13:27.090
that's why they have wranglers,
you know?

237
00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:31.530
And that was sort of like where that was where we began with that I liked doing.

238
00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:33.990
I,
you know what I liked about it,
doing wow.
Well then,

239
00:13:33.991 --> 00:13:37.140
and it was so many years ago now,
um,
we did eight of them.

240
00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:42.520
I liked,
I fell in love with the,

241
00:13:42.610 --> 00:13:47.580
the guys that I traveled with,
man.

242
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.500
I mean,
like when we quit doing that show and the show didn't get renewed,
I mean,

243
00:13:52.501 --> 00:13:55.650
they knew we were still filming the last episode and we already knew it was

244
00:13:56.310 --> 00:13:59.020
going down hill.
Right.
Um,

245
00:13:59.130 --> 00:14:02.640
just to viewership wasn't there at the wrong viewership and you know,

246
00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:05.310
or like the v the numbers weren't there and the numbers that were,

247
00:14:05.311 --> 00:14:09.930
that weren't the right numbers,
like not the demographic thereafter.
Right.
Um,

248
00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:11.160
and you weren't going to fix that,

249
00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:16.200
but I had fallen in love so bad with the guys that I worked with that it was

250
00:14:16.201 --> 00:14:18.630
like,
it was like getting broken up with,

251
00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:23.150
by a girl that we weren't going to hang out together anymore and traveled

252
00:14:23.151 --> 00:14:28.020
together anymore.
I mean,
it was bad,
you know,
all these guys,
you know,

253
00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:32.720
which guys like everyone,
man,
Mo,

254
00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:36.830
all those guys were on that show.
Yeah.
Moe knew you took him over to don't know.

255
00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:41.220
I know I still,
I still associate with them,
but at the time,

256
00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:46.710
like now I try to wander when I look at that show and there's some good stuff

257
00:14:46.711 --> 00:14:51.000
about,
and there's a lot of bad stuff about it.
Um,
embarrassing stuff about

258
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:55.100
<v 1>when I look at it now and I try to go like,
why did I want that to,</v>

259
00:14:55.430 --> 00:15:00.260
why did I so badly want that to continue?
Um,
and I did at the time,

260
00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:01.700
you know,
I really wanted to keep doing it,

261
00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:07.150
not knowing that I would find such happiness doing what I'm doing now,
um,

262
00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:11.930
that I would find such a,
like a,
a sense of peace doing what I'm doing now.

263
00:15:11.970 --> 00:15:14.840
I feel like I'm being constructive and working with good people,
doing good work.

264
00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:17.810
At the time I was just devastated that we weren't going to go.
And now I'm like,

265
00:15:17.811 --> 00:15:18.644
why did I feel that way?

266
00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:21.770
And I think in some ways to just cause I like running around with those guys.

267
00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:24.440
Well,
it's fun,
man.
Look,

268
00:15:24.441 --> 00:15:28.010
we really a lot of fun and we took us to Montana enemies that we could,
like,

269
00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:32.090
there was like a gang of us then we had and we felt like we were surrounded by

270
00:15:32.091 --> 00:15:33.000
enemies.
Oh,

271
00:15:33.001 --> 00:15:36.800
the enemy's being a jackass who all these people around and were like,
man,

272
00:15:36.801 --> 00:15:40.000
if we can go another season and we're going to clean house,
right.

273
00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:45.070
And it's turned us into this perfect thing.
And it was like,
yeah,

274
00:15:45.130 --> 00:15:48.980
we're like,
uh,
I dunno man.
The story of every television too.

275
00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:53.700
We were like warriors,
man,
you know,
I loved it.

276
00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:55.670
Well,
it doesn't feel love those guys.

277
00:15:55.671 --> 00:15:58.790
There's a fun bonding thing that goes with those shows.

278
00:15:58.791 --> 00:16:01.330
It's different than any other show you do.
You film a normal show.

279
00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:03.850
Say if you do like a television show it even,

280
00:16:04.070 --> 00:16:06.440
whether it's on a set or it's on location,
you go,

281
00:16:06.441 --> 00:16:10.070
you film it and then you go either to your hotel or you go,
you know,

282
00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:11.510
back to your house.

283
00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:14.450
Then you show up back on the set in the morning and there's a bonding involved

284
00:16:14.451 --> 00:16:17.450
in that.
But there's a totally different kind of bonding when you're in,

285
00:16:17.451 --> 00:16:22.451
say like when you took us to the Missouri breaks down the Missouri River in

286
00:16:23.271 --> 00:16:27.980
Montana and you're,
you're,
you're in the wilderness together and you're,

287
00:16:27.981 --> 00:16:28.761
you know,
your,

288
00:16:28.761 --> 00:16:33.140
your only source of entertainment is we're sitting around a campfire at night

289
00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:34.840
shooting the shit laughing.
Yeah.

290
00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:38.900
And there's this crazy bond that you have with people when you do something like

291
00:16:38.901 --> 00:16:39.111
that.

292
00:16:39.111 --> 00:16:41.870
And when you're doing it over and over and over and over again like you're doing

293
00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:45.350
like the regular world of civilization seems so stupid.

294
00:16:45.351 --> 00:16:48.830
The Red Lights and the fucking telephone poles,

295
00:16:48.831 --> 00:16:51.050
you just want to just want to give back.

296
00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:55.040
You want to go back to the fun stuff when you're out there in the woods looking

297
00:16:55.041 --> 00:16:58.640
for a buck or trying to find a ram or whatever the fuck you trying to do.

298
00:16:58.641 --> 00:17:03.641
It's like there's this crazy heightened reality to that life that especially

299
00:17:06.741 --> 00:17:11.741
when you have a bunch of men together and you have the opportunity to just do,

300
00:17:12.690 --> 00:17:15.920
it's almost like play time.
Like you have this,

301
00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:18.920
this wild existence,
you know,

302
00:17:18.921 --> 00:17:21.680
and then it gets taken away.
Yeah,

303
00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:26.210
I'm a Klansman and I don't mean that with a k plans and want to see and it's

304
00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:27.050
like,
I do feel like,

305
00:17:27.050 --> 00:17:31.490
like all through growing up I had it like,

306
00:17:31.530 --> 00:17:35.660
well I still hang out.
Like my,
I still consider,
I still regard my two brothers,

307
00:17:35.661 --> 00:17:39.140
like the main people that I hang out with,
you know,

308
00:17:39.141 --> 00:17:43.520
even in a time sense that's not true.
Like in his mind,
like,
you know,

309
00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:45.260
days per year.
That's not true.

310
00:17:45.261 --> 00:17:47.900
But they're like the main thing outside of my immediate,

311
00:17:47.930 --> 00:17:50.010
my wife and kids like my,

312
00:17:50.090 --> 00:17:52.590
<v 2>yeah,
I think my two brothers are like this main thing and,</v>

313
00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:56.640
but we always had these guys that we hung out with growing up,
the same guys.

314
00:17:56.641 --> 00:17:57.474
We still hang out.

315
00:17:58.170 --> 00:18:01.500
Like just this summer we had people out to our shack or fishing shack and it's

316
00:18:01.501 --> 00:18:05.550
like mostly guys from Michigan that we've known long time,
you know,

317
00:18:05.670 --> 00:18:10.640
and I do kind of feel that,
uh,
that,
that,

318
00:18:10.641 --> 00:18:13.890
that hunting and fishing for me do foreign,
those kinds of relationships,

319
00:18:13.891 --> 00:18:16.380
you know,
and traveling together forms,
those kind of relationships.

320
00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:20.010
I also got to bend good in the military maybe because you get to like have this

321
00:18:20.011 --> 00:18:22.650
little core guys,
you know?
And yeah,

322
00:18:22.651 --> 00:18:25.120
traveling with those guys that I worked with and with,
you know,

323
00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:29.160
and now it's just like the revolving cast a members like face has changed,

324
00:18:29.161 --> 00:18:33.940
but it still feels the same as,
yeah,
it's like this little,
like a little clan,

325
00:18:33.941 --> 00:18:37.740
you know,
like,
you know,
click a felon.
Even I do bad.
I'll just like,

326
00:18:37.741 --> 00:18:41.160
I liked that of,
I like hanging out with three or four people out in the woods,

327
00:18:41.161 --> 00:18:42.060
you know,
it's fun.

328
00:18:42.061 --> 00:18:45.030
I mean even me and calendar when we'd done a few episodes with you,

329
00:18:45.031 --> 00:18:47.610
but Cowan was a pastor and media of the night.
He's like,

330
00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:50.640
why don't we go in again when we come going,
honey,
I gotta get Outta here.

331
00:18:50.790 --> 00:18:54.060
He's like,
I gotta get Outta here.
Let's call it,
let's go on and call Steve.

332
00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:56.310
We were just of this summer,

333
00:18:56.460 --> 00:18:59.850
August 15th we're going to Prince of Wales Island got sunburned.

334
00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:03.810
Sunburnt that's hilarious.
Killed.
Buck's got some.

335
00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:08.330
I mean it was like you wouldn't have believed.
I believe it.
Listen man,

336
00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:11.220
one of the things that I took from those,
so nice.
I was,

337
00:19:11.221 --> 00:19:14.860
if I would have done anything to swap the weather cause going up there like,

338
00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:19.400
yeah,
I got like a,
I got Dan Dougherty mentioned,
I just right now have a,

339
00:19:19.401 --> 00:19:24.090
Dodi had said,
he's like,
I'm never going back to this island,
you know,

340
00:19:24.091 --> 00:19:26.670
and like we're done on this stupid island after our trip.

341
00:19:26.850 --> 00:19:29.610
And we went up there and he was very like,
you know,

342
00:19:29.611 --> 00:19:31.710
he had a very tentative feeling about the weather.

343
00:19:31.711 --> 00:19:33.990
We kept watching the forecast and then when would be a nice,

344
00:19:34.550 --> 00:19:38.850
and we went up there.
I was just like sunshine deer everywhere.

345
00:19:40.050 --> 00:19:42.750
It was perfect.
Not you wouldn't believe it,
man.
It's August.

346
00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:43.620
You've got to go in August.

347
00:19:43.621 --> 00:19:48.621
Is that the move Yanis got Yanis got a buck like doing after hours doing a

348
00:19:49.030 --> 00:19:52.080
little earlier hours.
You're filming.
Yeah.
I took something away.

349
00:19:52.081 --> 00:19:55.440
Very important from that show.
And it's something that you said,
uh,

350
00:19:55.510 --> 00:19:59.160
w w I think you said it when we were in the tent when we were doing your
podcast,

351
00:19:59.490 --> 00:20:02.520
talking about the different kinds of fun.
There's fun.

352
00:20:02.550 --> 00:20:04.440
That's fun while you're doing it like a rollercoaster,

353
00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:05.850
but it's not fun after it's over.

354
00:20:05.851 --> 00:20:09.240
But this other things that are fun way after you doing it,

355
00:20:09.241 --> 00:20:11.200
but while you're doing it,
it's miserable.
Yeah.

356
00:20:11.250 --> 00:20:13.650
That's stole that theory from two guys.

357
00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:18.990
A guy named hardcore Jaffe and a guy named mark and a guy named Matt Raf Rice's

358
00:20:18.991 --> 00:20:23.910
name.
Hardcore Jeff.
So hardcore.
Yeah.
Hardcore.

359
00:20:23.911 --> 00:20:27.870
Jeff Knew Matt Rafferty
in recently.

360
00:20:27.871 --> 00:20:30.480
Someone sent me a link where I think that it had,
I feel it,

361
00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:33.600
it was like a ad of some sort that alluded to that,

362
00:20:34.890 --> 00:20:36.980
like an advertisement that alluded to that,

363
00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:40.770
but it was like a mountain earring thing.
So I don't know.
Yeah.

364
00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:44.520
But I just don't want to,
I don't want to take claim for that theory,

365
00:20:44.521 --> 00:20:47.230
but they had this thing like the four levels of,

366
00:20:48.210 --> 00:20:51.760
<v 1>you know,
the four or five levels of fun,
these guys out of anchorage,</v>

367
00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:56.650
you know,
and,
and uh,
yeah,
it was profound.
But it's,
it is profound.

368
00:20:56.651 --> 00:20:58.990
And I never thought about it until that trip.

369
00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:03.700
They're like roller coasters aren't fun after you do them at all.
No,

370
00:21:04.210 --> 00:21:07.060
I was on a rollercoaster last week.
Is that right?
Yeah.

371
00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:11.320
So what Brian and last week,
local carnival local,

372
00:21:11.321 --> 00:21:13.020
it was fucking terrifying rollercoaster.

373
00:21:13.090 --> 00:21:16.930
I took photos of the base of it and put it on my Instagram just because it's so

374
00:21:16.931 --> 00:21:20.830
fucking ridiculous.
They have this set up and when you look at this setup,

375
00:21:20.831 --> 00:21:24.340
you're like,
why the fuck did I,
cause it's so bad.

376
00:21:24.341 --> 00:21:28.800
It's like pictures of a him shy,
I'll pull it up.
There's a,

377
00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:33.900
these bricks that they have where a blocks that they have that's holding up the,

378
00:21:34.211 --> 00:21:39.190
uh,
the base of this thing.
It's like at theme.

379
00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:42.130
Yeah.
Well you can see it on the screen a little bit better,

380
00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:44.110
but they have the foundation,

381
00:21:44.111 --> 00:21:47.620
so they have these posts and then a bunch of Shims on the health.
Yeah.

382
00:21:47.621 --> 00:21:52.090
That's fucking blocks of wood.
I mean,
just,
they're,
they're not nailed down.

383
00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:52.700
I mean it's,

384
00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:56.110
it's so fucking ridiculous that you get in that thing and it's spinning people

385
00:21:56.111 --> 00:21:59.080
around 50 miles around.
It's pretty funny.
They just,

386
00:21:59.590 --> 00:22:03.160
whatever they could find a couple of bricks.
It's a full on Carney.

387
00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:05.950
It's cotton and cotton board.
But,
uh,

388
00:22:06.610 --> 00:22:09.220
after it's over and the only thing that's fun is looking at this picture,

389
00:22:09.580 --> 00:22:12.880
but after it's over,
you know,
I didn't even notice that at first.

390
00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:18.340
I went on roller coasters.
Fun in the moment,
but not fun later.
Yeah.

391
00:22:18.430 --> 00:22:22.480
And then just things that are terrifying while you're experiencing it,

392
00:22:22.481 --> 00:22:27.130
but after you survive it,
you're like,
ah.
That was,
that was crazy.

393
00:22:27.131 --> 00:22:31.300
That was awesome.
That trip was a miserable four or five days,

394
00:22:31.301 --> 00:22:32.710
whatever the fuck it was on that island.

395
00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:36.250
But after it was over count and I laugh about that trip all the time.
Yeah.

396
00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:39.760
We just got,
we just got back from hunting in British Columbia and it was,

397
00:22:39.910 --> 00:22:42.420
it was just my feet are still,

398
00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:45.700
because my feet were so cold for so long and my feet are still weird.

399
00:22:45.701 --> 00:22:49.180
Like when I lay in bed at night,
they feel numb really.
And

400
00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:53.770
it just,
I mean,
just generally sucked.
Fog,

401
00:22:53.771 --> 00:22:58.720
snow spent whole days sitting under a tarp cause he can't see anything in the

402
00:22:58.721 --> 00:23:01.150
fog.
Um,
it still,

403
00:23:01.710 --> 00:23:06.220
I plan on it seeming fun later,
but not yet right now.

404
00:23:06.221 --> 00:23:09.770
It's not right now.
I still think it,
sorry,

405
00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:12.430
did I get a couple of months?
I won't think it sucked.

406
00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:14.830
Didn't I call you when I got back to la?

407
00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:19.750
They tell you how fucking awesome I felt you did.
I,
it was a quick turn around.

408
00:23:19.780 --> 00:23:24.760
I was driving around La and the sun was shining like it always is that it was

409
00:23:24.761 --> 00:23:26.290
warm.
Like it always is.

410
00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:31.300
But I appreciated it on a level that I had never appreciated it before because

411
00:23:31.301 --> 00:23:33.610
being rain soaked in that island,

412
00:23:33.790 --> 00:23:37.840
huddles huddling up in that tent and I remember turning on that a little

413
00:23:37.841 --> 00:23:42.580
headlamp and seeing mist everywhere inside the 10 I'm like,

414
00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:45.950
I thought in my stupid head that there was going to be a place

415
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:49.700
<v 3>you could go to get dry.
Like you'd go inside the tent and you would get dry.</v>

416
00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:52.580
Well,
it's raining outside,
but that's okay.
You get in the tank,
it'd be no,

417
00:23:52.581 --> 00:23:55.220
there's no dry.
There was no dry.
The air was wet.

418
00:23:55.460 --> 00:23:59.570
The actual air everywhere around you was filled with moisture.

419
00:23:59.690 --> 00:24:03.320
So everything was wet no matter what.
And so when I got back to La,

420
00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:06.950
I felt fucking fantastic.
Yeah.
I was like,
this is amazing.

421
00:24:06.951 --> 00:24:11.951
And it gave me an appreciation for la that I wouldn't have had if I didn't go

422
00:24:12.051 --> 00:24:12.884
through that.

423
00:24:12.990 --> 00:24:13.270
<v 4>Well,
yeah,</v>

424
00:24:13.270 --> 00:24:16.830
to go home from something like that and then be in bed all warm with like your

425
00:24:16.831 --> 00:24:20.990
wife.
Oh Man.
You know I've talked to you off about Rourke Denver.
No,

426
00:24:21.010 --> 00:24:25.200
he's like was a navy seal officer and ran at Bud's program,

427
00:24:25.201 --> 00:24:26.190
which is like this whole thing.

428
00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:30.210
Like you basically go there to suffer and he was talking about how you think

429
00:24:30.211 --> 00:24:33.750
like you go into a seal's home you think is going to be all spartan.
You know,

430
00:24:34.170 --> 00:24:37.260
like he's sleeping on a stack of cardboard or something.
He goes,

431
00:24:37.261 --> 00:24:42.030
those guys have like,
you go in there,
it's like the Egyptian cotton,
the nicest,

432
00:24:42.031 --> 00:24:43.770
most comfortable homes man.

433
00:24:43.771 --> 00:24:47.520
Because you wind up after like the suffering,

434
00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.920
you soap badly,
want to go be comfortable that they go,
he's like,

435
00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:54.900
they go out of their way to have a comfortable house,
you know,

436
00:24:54.901 --> 00:24:58.860
like more than normal people's cause you want to just soak up comfort when you

437
00:24:58.861 --> 00:25:03.000
get the cheese.
Yeah.
It makes sense.
If they don't want to live in a log cabin,

438
00:25:03.001 --> 00:25:04.520
sleep on a futon.
Yeah.
Is it,

439
00:25:04.521 --> 00:25:07.890
you want to go home and lay on really nice sheets because it might only be two

440
00:25:07.891 --> 00:25:09.630
nights,
man.
You know,
you want to get your fill.

441
00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:15.130
<v 3>It totally makes sense.
Um,
I think having these conversations and uh,</v>

442
00:25:15.190 --> 00:25:18.700
and what you're doing on your show is it's very,

443
00:25:18.701 --> 00:25:22.150
it's very important because it's giving people a different sense of hunting.

444
00:25:22.151 --> 00:25:27.040
It's one of the things that I get all the time from tweets and Facebook messages

445
00:25:27.041 --> 00:25:32.041
and that people change their perspective because of your show and because of

446
00:25:32.261 --> 00:25:36.220
these conversations that you've had on my podcast and because of your podcast,

447
00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:40.780
people have changed their perceptions of it because people who don't experience

448
00:25:40.781 --> 00:25:42.430
hunting personally and they,

449
00:25:42.431 --> 00:25:46.510
their ideas of it a lot of times are shaped by the portrayals of hunters and

450
00:25:46.511 --> 00:25:51.010
movies,
which are almost always negative.
Yeah.
Especially the animated ones.

451
00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:52.390
Like Elmer Fudd.

452
00:25:53.890 --> 00:25:57.940
<v 4>No.
Yeah.
My kids watch my kids like to show about animals.</v>

453
00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:00.400
Then it's like there's a bad guys.

454
00:26:01.490 --> 00:26:02.010
<v 0>Okay.</v>

455
00:26:02.010 --> 00:26:06.450
<v 4>It's,
it's like these two brothers and they have this cartoon show.
Wild Kratts.</v>

456
00:26:06.451 --> 00:26:10.770
Yeah.
Yeah.
So there's like,
the kids loved that show.
Okay.
But there's,

457
00:26:10.830 --> 00:26:13.950
there's like some recurring bad guys.
One of them's a chef.

458
00:26:15.370 --> 00:26:18.070
It's like a chef who's out in the woods.
Like he's always trying to hunt,
right.

459
00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:22.180
The words to make food.
And the other one's like maybe like a,

460
00:26:22.210 --> 00:26:26.890
like a gay seeming urbanite guy.
Yeah.
He's like an evil guy.

461
00:26:26.990 --> 00:26:31.720
Had like a real care guy.
Yeah.
But real like real,
you know,

462
00:26:31.930 --> 00:26:33.610
just like kind of bad,
you know.

463
00:26:33.611 --> 00:26:37.150
It's like your one hand telling you there's two people that are bad kids is gay

464
00:26:37.151 --> 00:26:38.410
guys and and chefs,

465
00:26:38.550 --> 00:26:39.383
<v 3>Huh?</v>

466
00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:45.620
<v 1>Yeah.
But want to watch that show.
You won't let them watch it.
No.</v>

467
00:26:45.621 --> 00:26:47.970
I mean they learned,
they learned some good wildlife stuff,

468
00:26:47.971 --> 00:26:50.610
but I'm like I just don't want to,
I'm not going to let it know.
I don't,

469
00:26:50.611 --> 00:26:53.140
I tell him that I tried to explain him why I didn't like it.

470
00:26:53.141 --> 00:26:56.100
They didn't their stamina.
I don't like I'm watching a show.
That's hilarious.

471
00:26:56.130 --> 00:26:58.560
Yeah.
Like that.
They're like,

472
00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:02.850
I just can't have a show where like the bad guy is like some guy that like a

473
00:27:02.851 --> 00:27:05.300
chef who is always out trying to hide.

474
00:27:05.330 --> 00:27:10.290
Like he's was trying to hunt endangered species.
But that show,

475
00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:14.340
like one of the guys,
I don't know if it's Chris or Martin,
one of them is fat.

476
00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:18.450
I went to,
I took my kid to their live show.
They have a live show in Hollywood.

477
00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:23.130
Oh fucking terrible.
But for five-year-old,
awesome.
You know,
it's like really bad.

478
00:27:23.131 --> 00:27:26.200
They have costumes on,
you know,
they go into their superpowers.
Yeah.

479
00:27:26.250 --> 00:27:27.001
They have like a,

480
00:27:27.001 --> 00:27:30.960
the animal powers activate and they have these like things that they,
they can,

481
00:27:30.961 --> 00:27:34.840
they can assume the attributes of whatever animal they're talking about.
Yeah.

482
00:27:35.310 --> 00:27:39.120
In the show on the television show,
it's cartoons.
Yeah.

483
00:27:39.210 --> 00:27:44.010
So they can do all this crazy stuff.
But I'm going somewhere.
Yes.
The two bros.

484
00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:48.570
And they're jovial.
Very chatty.
Yeah.
They go smart.
And then,

485
00:27:48.571 --> 00:27:53.340
and then the show starts.
Yeah.
Yeah.
In the live show though,

486
00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:56.040
they don't go anywhere.
And so the live show,

487
00:27:56.041 --> 00:27:59.310
they just put on these outfits and it's so fucking stupid.

488
00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:02.340
They put on like big rubber feet.
They pretend to be a fox.

489
00:28:02.341 --> 00:28:03.750
Like it's just ridiculous.

490
00:28:03.751 --> 00:28:07.470
So you're not an of authors and he jumped around on a trampoline and they,
they,

491
00:28:07.490 --> 00:28:12.210
they,
they jump on trampolines to pretend that they have like serval cat powers.

492
00:28:12.310 --> 00:28:15.930
Yeah.
It's in the trampolines hidden behind a rock.
But you can fucking see it.

493
00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:19.800
If I knew that those guys are big vegetarians,
I'd be like,
okay,
that's cool.

494
00:28:20.670 --> 00:28:22.740
Now they probably aren't,
but I don't get,
yeah,

495
00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:24.990
I never even paid attention to the fact that,

496
00:28:25.050 --> 00:28:29.370
that that one guy is a like sort of a hunter or a chef and that's why he's the

497
00:28:29.371 --> 00:28:31.800
bad guy.
Yeah.
I never even paid attention.

498
00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:34.860
You're more sensitive to that than I am.
I'm overly sensitive

499
00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:40.680
when I hear people don't let their kids watch certain shows like because of

500
00:28:40.681 --> 00:28:43.230
whatever.
I'm like the guy,
I don't,
I don't like him watch and stuff.

501
00:28:43.231 --> 00:28:47.160
It has a negative trail on hunters.
That's funny.
Well,

502
00:28:47.161 --> 00:28:50.640
I'm writing this thing right now that I'll,
I'll put out,
uh,
probably,
uh,

503
00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:53.760
tomorrow about all the people that got mad at me.

504
00:28:53.761 --> 00:28:56.870
Cause I put up a picture of that elk last week,
um,

505
00:28:57.090 --> 00:29:01.470
that got mad at me and then I went to their Twitter pages or their Instagram

506
00:29:01.471 --> 00:29:04.680
pages and I saw pictures of their cats.
No.
And I'm like,

507
00:29:04.681 --> 00:29:05.550
well you feeding your cat.

508
00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:06.750
<v 0>Okay,</v>

509
00:29:06.750 --> 00:29:10.410
<v 1>cause you're feeding your cat cat food and where's that cat food coming from?</v>

510
00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:13.470
Someone's killing animals,
someone's killing chickens.
No surprise.

511
00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:17.320
Some guy is price,
some guy running high seas drift nets.

512
00:29:18.110 --> 00:29:22.320
That to how an international waters.
Yeah,
that to rape and those that,

513
00:29:22.350 --> 00:29:23.730
that's one of the things that,
you know,

514
00:29:23.731 --> 00:29:26.310
it's so easy to fall in the trap of talking about stuff that annoys you.

515
00:29:26.311 --> 00:29:28.410
But that's one thing is like

516
00:29:31.270 --> 00:29:34.150
people that you can have this holier than thou attitude,

517
00:29:34.180 --> 00:29:36.310
like a lot of catch and release.
Fishermen have it,
you know,

518
00:29:36.370 --> 00:29:37.390
they'll go out fishing,

519
00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:40.450
they'll net their trout go and you know those sons of bitches go to a restaurant

520
00:29:40.451 --> 00:29:44.080
that night,
we'll need to order fish.
And you're like,
they don't like,

521
00:29:44.110 --> 00:29:46.810
well who's fishes at yeah.
Was like,

522
00:29:47.110 --> 00:29:50.410
who's very favorite area to that fish come from?
You know,

523
00:29:50.411 --> 00:29:53.980
probably some places a lot more imperiled and where you live.
Well not only that,

524
00:29:53.981 --> 00:29:57.270
the cat,
the reality of catching releases,
what 10% of them die,

525
00:29:57.310 --> 00:30:01.540
20% of them die as much higher.
But yeah,
it's that thing that you like,

526
00:30:01.541 --> 00:30:04.170
you just don't want to be,
you don't want to look at it,
you know?
Yeah.

527
00:30:04.210 --> 00:30:06.280
If you got a cat and you're feeding and stuff like that,

528
00:30:06.730 --> 00:30:10.570
it's probably your proudly support and some,
some,
uh,

529
00:30:11.710 --> 00:30:14.590
you probably support important some fisheries practices that you would,

530
00:30:14.620 --> 00:30:19.570
that you're glad you don't know about.
Yeah.
Not,
and not just fish,
chicken,
lamb.

531
00:30:19.670 --> 00:30:21.160
<v 3>Well,
whatever the fuck you're feeding your cat,</v>

532
00:30:21.161 --> 00:30:25.080
you're buying cat food and cat foods.
Animals.
Cause cats need protein.
They,

533
00:30:25.420 --> 00:30:28.510
they're not omnivores.
They're predators.
You can't,
I mean,

534
00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:33.160
there's very few arguments.
Make any sense.
You can feed your cat a Vegan Diet.

535
00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:37.270
Apparently you can get away with it.
With some dogs.
They can feed some dogs,

536
00:30:37.670 --> 00:30:41.380
primarily vegetable based Diet.
And the dogs are all right.
They're not,

537
00:30:41.410 --> 00:30:46.030
it's not optimum.
But for cats,
they get organ failure,
cardiovascular failure,

538
00:30:46.031 --> 00:30:49.240
they go blind.
It's a big issue with cats when you feed them,

539
00:30:49.310 --> 00:30:51.730
try to feed him a Vegan Diet to go blind.

540
00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:54.470
<v 1>Well,
I'd also invite those people,</v>

541
00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:59.420
your critics to understand that those elk wouldn't be here if it were not for

542
00:30:59.421 --> 00:31:03.470
hunter interest.
Yeah,
that's an interesting conversation.

543
00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:05.840
They just would not be here.
Did you?
Um,

544
00:31:05.990 --> 00:31:10.910
I don't know if you've listened to the radio lab podcast on that guy.

545
00:31:10.970 --> 00:31:15.230
Uh,
no,
I didn't.
The line,
no,
I want it to,

546
00:31:15.260 --> 00:31:18.590
I was gone when that happened and there's so many people sent me links to buy,

547
00:31:18.591 --> 00:31:22.270
still having listened to,
but it was about the guy that
yeah,

548
00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:26.420
about some of the complexities of the guy that paid out all 350 grand,

549
00:31:26.421 --> 00:31:27.254
a hundred black rhino.

550
00:31:27.950 --> 00:31:32.880
I had that guy on the podcast and he discussed it and we talked about it and it,

551
00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:36.140
but what's interesting is they,
uh,

552
00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:41.200
had on another guy who was in the radio lab show that was a,

553
00:31:42.830 --> 00:31:47.700
I forget his position,
but he's uh,
uh,
someone who,
uh,

554
00:31:47.750 --> 00:31:52.080
works to,
to help wildlife and he was,
he was saying that it's,

555
00:31:52.370 --> 00:31:57.370
the idea is ridiculous that you could kill these animals and that you would say

556
00:31:58.251 --> 00:31:59.960
that you're working as a conservationist,

557
00:31:59.961 --> 00:32:04.340
but you still kill these animals and that you're trying to protect them and make

558
00:32:04.341 --> 00:32:08.600
more of them and let them breed and let them repopulate so that you can kill

559
00:32:08.601 --> 00:32:12.860
them.
I'm like,
that's preposterous.
But the,

560
00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:17.140
<v 3>the real problem with any of these arguments is you got know,</v>

561
00:32:17.150 --> 00:32:19.810
like I always don't want to know,
like what do you,
do you eat meat,

562
00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:21.250
do you wear leather?
Like how,

563
00:32:21.430 --> 00:32:24.580
if you're making this argument against the hunting of these animals,

564
00:32:24.730 --> 00:32:26.200
like where do you get your protein from?

565
00:32:26.201 --> 00:32:30.100
Are you getting your protein from all plant sources?
Because in that case,

566
00:32:30.101 --> 00:32:33.700
maybe we can have this conversation about that.
But if you're not,
man,

567
00:32:33.730 --> 00:32:38.020
if you're choosing animals that you think are okay and not okay to kill and it's

568
00:32:38.021 --> 00:32:42.710
based on which ones are captive,
that seems to me more fucked up.
Yeah,

569
00:32:43.020 --> 00:32:45.560
it's,
it's way more cruel in my opinion,

570
00:32:45.770 --> 00:32:50.770
to put an animal in a cage and that animal ear marked for death and you just

571
00:32:52.701 --> 00:32:55.880
stuff it and keep fattening it up until you kill it.

572
00:32:56.030 --> 00:32:57.770
And to think that somehow that's a,
that's a,

573
00:32:57.940 --> 00:33:01.550
a better moral decision and going out and killing something in the wild.

574
00:33:02.030 --> 00:33:06.380
But then there's the trophy hunting thing and that's where it gets weird when

575
00:33:06.410 --> 00:33:10.610
you,
you say,
well bill,
these are animals that people aren't even eating.
You know,

576
00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:12.770
like the lion thing,
which the guy,

577
00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:16.130
the guy was just a clear apparently of any wrongdoing,

578
00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:20.660
<v 2>you know,
I never,
it was so hard to figure out what exactly was going on there.</v>

579
00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:22.970
I would love to know some of the,

580
00:33:24.290 --> 00:33:26.510
some of what was really going on with the,

581
00:33:26.570 --> 00:33:30.320
with the lion then because there's so many claims there were being made that

582
00:33:30.321 --> 00:33:34.420
just in some way didn't add up like that he had,
um,

583
00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:38.810
you heard that they had lowered it out of the park.
Right.

584
00:33:39.470 --> 00:33:42.680
I don't really know what that means now if you could,
because for instance,

585
00:33:42.681 --> 00:33:45.920
and people actually how bad that was that he had lowered it out of the park.

586
00:33:46.850 --> 00:33:49.370
But in the u s

587
00:33:51.140 --> 00:33:56.090
an animal can move across borders freely.

588
00:33:57.250 --> 00:33:58.370
You know,
it was generally illegal.

589
00:33:58.371 --> 00:34:02.720
The fence in wildlife in some way that it can't get away and animal can move

590
00:34:02.721 --> 00:34:05.060
across borders freely and its own,

591
00:34:05.061 --> 00:34:08.540
its public ownership doesn't change when it moves around.

592
00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:14.470
This is something that I've tried to explain a thousand times,
but if you have,

593
00:34:14.530 --> 00:34:17.620
let's take a like some iconic park like Yellowstone national park or if you have

594
00:34:17.621 --> 00:34:22.621
an elk in Yellowstone national park and it jumps a border on the private land

595
00:34:23.231 --> 00:34:23.681
and the jumps,

596
00:34:23.681 --> 00:34:26.440
the board around the federal national forest land jumps a border on the state,

597
00:34:26.441 --> 00:34:29.770
land,
jumps the border and do subdivision jumps a border into a county park.

598
00:34:29.980 --> 00:34:32.350
Throughout all his,
a little journey there,

599
00:34:32.470 --> 00:34:35.350
he's always been the property of the state.
Okay.

600
00:34:36.130 --> 00:34:39.640
When elk migrate out of Yellowstone National Park,
they get hunted.

601
00:34:40.720 --> 00:34:41.830
You know many,
many,

602
00:34:42.010 --> 00:34:45.640
many animals to get hunted and Wyoming and Montana are animals that as part of

603
00:34:45.641 --> 00:34:48.640
the year spend time in Yellowstone national park.

604
00:34:48.970 --> 00:34:53.970
My brother wants drew a big horn sheep tag for the upper Yellowstone valley and

605
00:34:56.170 --> 00:35:00.580
there's this peak near the Gardiner entrance to Yellowstone national park called

606
00:35:00.581 --> 00:35:04.840
electric peak and a lot of big horn sheep spend their summer on electric peak

607
00:35:05.470 --> 00:35:06.610
when he had that tag.

608
00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:09.700
This is in 2005 I think it's quite a while ago when he had that tag.

609
00:35:09.970 --> 00:35:14.480
We're just waiting for snow to pile up
on.

610
00:35:14.481 --> 00:35:18.290
Electric peak in the sheet would begin migrating and they would migrate down and

611
00:35:18.291 --> 00:35:21.980
spend and spend the winter down in some grass,

612
00:35:22.070 --> 00:35:25.120
some like range land up and down the Yellowstone,
so we would go there.

613
00:35:25.370 --> 00:35:28.970
It was on our third trip to the area when we finally found sheep.

614
00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:33.020
We're migrating down out of the high country out of Yellowstone national park.

615
00:35:33.050 --> 00:35:35.540
We killed a sheet within a couple miles,
the Yellowstone national park,

616
00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:38.130
so when people are talking about old,
like the how

617
00:35:38.130 --> 00:35:43.130
<v 1>the Lion Blonde and the park was of the park was lured off the park.</v>

618
00:35:43.890 --> 00:35:46.710
If,
if you condemn that in and of itself,

619
00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:51.330
then you really talking about something very revenue that would have very

620
00:35:51.331 --> 00:35:56.331
revolutionary implications here in the u s that animals aren't able to freely

621
00:35:57.151 --> 00:36:01.800
move or that an animal becomes the possession of whatever land app that whatever

622
00:36:01.801 --> 00:36:03.610
land administration it happens to be,

623
00:36:03.650 --> 00:36:07.770
but there's a big difference to an animal moving freely when they say it lured

624
00:36:07.771 --> 00:36:10.140
off.
I don't know.
That's what,
that's what I say.
I would love to know,

625
00:36:10.141 --> 00:36:13.770
like I don't know the answer to this.
They the day physically walk into the park?

626
00:36:13.890 --> 00:36:16.950
No.
What they did is they drove around the area,

627
00:36:16.951 --> 00:36:20.370
outside the park with bait and they drag carcass.

628
00:36:20.371 --> 00:36:23.070
They drag your carcass behind a truck.
That's true.
Standard,

629
00:36:23.071 --> 00:36:26.880
but not within the park.
No,
not within the park standard practice.
Not only that.

630
00:36:26.881 --> 00:36:31.881
Lions have a huge area that they traveling and they killed 28 other lions with

631
00:36:33.331 --> 00:36:34.950
tags,
with collars,

632
00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:40.100
and it was never an issue and this idea to this one lion was like this cherished

633
00:36:40.711 --> 00:36:45.140
beloved lion there was only by westerners who are like outsider.

634
00:36:45.141 --> 00:36:48.750
So the people that live in Zimbabwe,
they're fucking all monsters.

635
00:36:48.780 --> 00:36:50.690
They're all terrifying.
Some jewelry,

636
00:36:50.700 --> 00:36:53.010
that guy that wrote that piece in the New York Times is,
we didn't,

637
00:36:53.070 --> 00:36:54.180
we didn't know about that line.

638
00:36:54.710 --> 00:36:57.990
It's critical that when in Zimbabwe we don't cry for lions.
You know what I mean?

639
00:36:57.991 --> 00:36:59.010
That was the name of the piece.

640
00:36:59.011 --> 00:37:02.730
It was all talking about his family members that were terrified where these

641
00:37:02.731 --> 00:37:05.700
people would go outside and they had a very real fear.

642
00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:10.440
They were going to be killed by monsters,
giant cats that will kill everything,

643
00:37:10.441 --> 00:37:12.690
anything to kill people all the time.
You know,

644
00:37:12.691 --> 00:37:17.370
Jim Shockey has this great show called uncharted if you watched it.
Yep.

645
00:37:17.430 --> 00:37:19.350
I know about this show is great fucking show.

646
00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:23.880
And I was watching last night's show.
He was in Mozambique and um,

647
00:37:23.940 --> 00:37:28.940
there's these villagers in Mozambique that are just hunted by crocodiles and

648
00:37:29.850 --> 00:37:33.810
they showed dozens of people that were missing arms,

649
00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:38.040
missing feet,
had giant holes in their head.
We're a crocodile,

650
00:37:38.041 --> 00:37:41.850
had just barely grabbed them.
And these are the people that survived and they,

651
00:37:42.090 --> 00:37:46.680
they all had stories while they were there.
Uh,
a woman was taken into the,

652
00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:48.630
in the water while they were in camp.

653
00:37:49.050 --> 00:37:53.130
One of these women was washing clothes or gathering water and a crocodile came

654
00:37:53.131 --> 00:37:57.780
and got her.
And there's,
there's nothing you can do.
You just shit.

655
00:37:58.100 --> 00:37:59.910
They'd try to kill as many as they can.

656
00:38:00.030 --> 00:38:03.060
They bring in hunters to kill as many as they can.
But to these poor people,

657
00:38:03.061 --> 00:38:04.860
these people were just horrified.

658
00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:10.280
We don't look at that the way we look at lions because they're cold and the

659
00:38:10.830 --> 00:38:14.250
reptiles and,
but there it's just wildlife.

660
00:38:14.251 --> 00:38:18.300
But I think if you got to the point where you were facing where you might be

661
00:38:18.301 --> 00:38:23.130
looking at genetic extinction of the crocodile,
right,
it would change.
Yes.

662
00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:28.050
My thing,
my interest in the,

663
00:38:28.100 --> 00:38:30.840
the the lion controversy that came out of Africa,

664
00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:33.390
my interest in that is provincial in that

665
00:38:35.410 --> 00:38:36.070
I was

666
00:38:36.070 --> 00:38:39.310
<v 2>concerned about and I'm interested in the way that that's going to impact things</v>

667
00:38:39.311 --> 00:38:43.420
here.
You know,
uh,
not that interested in,

668
00:38:44.970 --> 00:38:48.660
not that,
not that I have antipathy toward,
I'm just not that,
that,

669
00:38:48.670 --> 00:38:53.670
that vested in what might happen with African big game hunting outside of how

670
00:38:55.031 --> 00:38:57.910
people's,
how the American imagination

671
00:39:01.190 --> 00:39:06.010
or the way the average American perceives hunting in his own country,

672
00:39:06.070 --> 00:39:11.070
it here in the u s would be colored by the actions of people in African in the

673
00:39:11.591 --> 00:39:13.720
circumstances that go on in Africa.

674
00:39:14.590 --> 00:39:19.590
That's my interest in that landscape as far as we were saying about the

675
00:39:19.781 --> 00:39:20.614
crocodile thing.

676
00:39:20.620 --> 00:39:25.620
I think that one of the reasons that it's so complicated with the lions is on

677
00:39:25.991 --> 00:39:30.991
one hand we're talking about the threat of genetic extinction of a species.

678
00:39:32.110 --> 00:39:36.550
And I'm sensitive to that here as well because we right now have,

679
00:39:36.670 --> 00:39:40.750
we're engaged in our own thing,
right?
We're engaged in the wolf debate right now.

680
00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:43.690
That in some way mirrors the,
the kind of language we're,

681
00:39:43.691 --> 00:39:48.691
we're hearing out of Africa where you have a animal,

682
00:39:49.091 --> 00:39:53.140
you have a species,
it's absent from much of its range.
Okay.

683
00:39:53.170 --> 00:39:57.580
So there used to be wills,
you know,
everywhere,
you know,
everywhere.

684
00:39:57.581 --> 00:40:00.790
But let's just say in the most recent past you had wolves in New Mexico and

685
00:40:00.791 --> 00:40:05.740
Colorado and Arizona.
They're,
they're all over the place.
Wolves here,
California.

686
00:40:06.130 --> 00:40:08.500
And then now they're gone for much of that landscape.

687
00:40:08.770 --> 00:40:13.750
But there are some areas like the greater Yellowstone ecosystem area around

688
00:40:13.751 --> 00:40:16.390
glacier in the u s that have,

689
00:40:17.380 --> 00:40:20.350
what I would say is on the verge of too many wolves.

690
00:40:20.950 --> 00:40:22.450
And so people could look and they'd be like,
well,

691
00:40:22.451 --> 00:40:26.590
how can there be too many if they're extinct across 97% of their range and the

692
00:40:26.591 --> 00:40:29.950
lower 48,
you know,
I'd be like,
well yeah,
it's very complicated.

693
00:40:30.090 --> 00:40:32.440
There are over abundant here and missing from there.

694
00:40:33.190 --> 00:40:36.940
And I see both sides of the debate because a lot of people who might come from

695
00:40:36.941 --> 00:40:41.941
my set of my understanding about wildlife who liked to hunt deer light town elk

696
00:40:42.491 --> 00:40:45.850
like to hunt Moose do want to see the wolves all the way gone.

697
00:40:46.090 --> 00:40:50.860
And what they would point to is the effect that wolves have on,
uh,
livestock,

698
00:40:50.861 --> 00:40:53.740
right?
People's way of making a living.

699
00:40:54.010 --> 00:40:56.050
There's safety implications or not.

700
00:40:56.051 --> 00:40:59.170
But some people say that there are safety implications from wolves being around.

701
00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:01.570
And when I look at them,
I'm like,
okay,
I take all that.

702
00:41:01.571 --> 00:41:03.370
But I don't think that that means we don't want wolves.

703
00:41:03.490 --> 00:41:08.170
I think we do want wolves do we want,
like how many do we want?

704
00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:12.580
You know,
I don't,
I do,
I agree that we want them around.

705
00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:17.050
I just agree that there's a limit to how many we want and what kind of
agreement.

706
00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:20.120
There was an agreement when they reintroduced him that when the population is so

707
00:41:21.150 --> 00:41:24.400
open as far past,
they would open up hunting and then they reneged on it.

708
00:41:24.820 --> 00:41:27.490
So I don't think most people,
it just,

709
00:41:27.550 --> 00:41:31.960
I'm like sensitive to the thing where as much as I was baffled by the Cecil the

710
00:41:31.961 --> 00:41:35.300
lion thing,
I'll a little bit like when there,

711
00:41:35.330 --> 00:41:38.750
when there was the backlash to the backlash and people said like,
Oh yeah,

712
00:41:38.751 --> 00:41:41.450
but you know,
people live in fear,
lions and lions kill people.

713
00:41:43.460 --> 00:41:47.120
I don't know that.
That doesn't really change anything for me.

714
00:41:47.121 --> 00:41:50.360
Like I don't think that that then means that,
oh,
you're right.

715
00:41:50.361 --> 00:41:52.430
We should kill all the lions because they kill people

716
00:41:55.720 --> 00:41:58.280
<v 1>tweeted the wrong went.
Was it a new link?</v>

717
00:41:58.520 --> 00:41:59.960
<v 0>Yes,

<v 1>Oh,
it's a different link every time.</v>

719
00:42:04.830 --> 00:42:05.450
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

720
00:42:05.450 --> 00:42:10.450
<v 1>What the Twitter or the youtube link cause youtube dot or c.com/c/.</v>

721
00:42:11.241 --> 00:42:16.000
Powerful Jerry.
Slash.
Live.
You must a copy and pasted.
Okay.

722
00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:19.520
All right.
I'll tweet that right now.
Oh,
Jesus Christ.
Jeremy,

723
00:42:21.170 --> 00:42:22.850
what was different about yesterdays,

724
00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:26.120
I don't know if you copied it from the same place it was at yesterday.

725
00:42:26.390 --> 00:42:28.610
It changes.
I'm sorry.
Keep going.

726
00:42:28.850 --> 00:42:32.680
<v 2>Steve.
Uh,
lost my train of thought.
Um,</v>

727
00:42:32.810 --> 00:42:35.120
<v 1>wolves,
blah,
blah blah.</v>

728
00:42:36.430 --> 00:42:37.030
<v 0>Okay.</v>

729
00:42:37.030 --> 00:42:39.370
<v 1>Yeah.
You want to keep the wolves alive?
Yeah.</v>

730
00:42:39.430 --> 00:42:43.900
<v 2>Oh,
that
the argument that like,</v>

731
00:42:43.930 --> 00:42:48.160
Oh yeah man,
it's okay to wipe something out because they hurt people.
Um,

732
00:42:48.700 --> 00:42:50.740
I don't really buy into that either.

733
00:42:54.020 --> 00:42:55.460
You don't know?

734
00:42:56.270 --> 00:43:00.740
I think that striving for with wildlife issues,

735
00:43:00.741 --> 00:43:05.390
I think striving for a happy medium where you can have many different

736
00:43:05.391 --> 00:43:08.780
stakeholders at the table talking about it is more constructive.

737
00:43:09.140 --> 00:43:12.320
And so I think as well with the Cecil the lion deal,

738
00:43:13.580 --> 00:43:17.810
I just think it really like clouded and confused tons of that shit here in the u

739
00:43:17.811 --> 00:43:21.220
s and made it harder for people to imagine,
um,

740
00:43:21.590 --> 00:43:25.850
the role of what I would call management,

741
00:43:25.851 --> 00:43:30.770
wildlife management,
game management.
You know,
because it's not like this,

742
00:43:31.250 --> 00:43:34.670
we no longer live in this Eden environment where you can,

743
00:43:34.700 --> 00:43:38.630
you can act somehow.
Like the hand of man is not at play.

744
00:43:39.620 --> 00:43:41.480
I mean we've,
we've cooked that world

745
00:43:42.840 --> 00:43:47.280
<v 1>well is the,
the issue that a lot of people have,
a big part of it is this,</v>

746
00:43:47.281 --> 00:43:52.281
this term trophy hunting trophy hunting is deemed to be evil and then people

747
00:43:54.180 --> 00:43:58.560
have respect for people that hunt.
If you hunt for your food,
I,
you know,

748
00:43:58.561 --> 00:44:02.010
I can appreciate that.
But what I don't like is this idea of trophy hunting.

749
00:44:02.011 --> 00:44:05.100
I mean that is a,
that's a giant issue with people.
Yeah.

750
00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:09.710
<v 2>It's a,
it's a semantics issue in some way.
I see it as,</v>

751
00:44:09.711 --> 00:44:12.740
and this is something that I spend a lot of time thinking about and talking

752
00:44:12.741 --> 00:44:15.010
about in recent years is a,

753
00:44:17.650 --> 00:44:17.951
there's,

754
00:44:17.951 --> 00:44:22.951
there's what trophy hunting means to someone who's unfamiliar with hunting.

755
00:44:24.280 --> 00:44:26.430
When they hear the term trophy hunting,
I think what they're,

756
00:44:26.440 --> 00:44:29.140
what they see in their mind,

757
00:44:29.830 --> 00:44:32.040
they see the wanton an animal

758
00:44:33.690 --> 00:44:38.690
<v 4>just in order to take a piece of the animal it's head or it's hide and have it</v>

759
00:44:41.041 --> 00:44:44.900
as a,
as a bragging rights thing
did.

760
00:44:44.910 --> 00:44:49.910
It's like this like callous slaughter of animals to to take part of it and take

761
00:44:51.961 --> 00:44:55.920
possession of part of it and use it as an emblem or to prove your manhood.
Right?

762
00:44:55.980 --> 00:44:57.210
Like that's what they're seeing.

763
00:44:58.170 --> 00:45:02.700
It's so pervasive now that that meaning of the word

764
00:45:04.410 --> 00:45:09.410
that I think that it might almost be time for people who do engage in trophy

765
00:45:10.741 --> 00:45:14.040
hunting to think about a new term.

766
00:45:15.870 --> 00:45:17.780
If I go out and,
and,

767
00:45:17.790 --> 00:45:21.510
and I hunt and get something,

768
00:45:21.540 --> 00:45:25.800
I do retain some parts of the animal that might be the,

769
00:45:25.801 --> 00:45:30.210
that would be a trophy the same way you have that school right there and that's

770
00:45:30.211 --> 00:45:31.410
gold right there.
Right,

771
00:45:31.950 --> 00:45:36.510
but it was a portion of of what you retained but you eat the animals.
Yeah.

772
00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:38.940
See I think the difference between that and a lion,

773
00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:42.810
because you're not eating a lion and I think that freaks people out.

774
00:45:42.811 --> 00:45:46.710
This idea of just killing something just for its head to stuff it and put it on

775
00:45:46.711 --> 00:45:50.190
the wall when it's not something that you're going to eat.
I they get free.
Yeah.

776
00:45:50.430 --> 00:45:53.610
I think it freaked people out.
The guy didn't eat it.

777
00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:57.990
I W I he should eat in the damn line.
I think you should have eaten it.

778
00:45:58.020 --> 00:46:00.720
He should eat and her found someone wanting to eat it and it apparently he

779
00:46:00.721 --> 00:46:04.650
shouldn't have been a dentist because people love the dead guy was a dentist.

780
00:46:04.950 --> 00:46:05.640
Why?

781
00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:09.990
I don't understand why there's no other occupation where he would've became the

782
00:46:09.991 --> 00:46:14.730
dentist that he,
if he was a welder,
the welder,
they killed the lion.
Yeah.

783
00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:18.780
It would just be that he was the guy with a name.
What is a public practice?

784
00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:21.560
That's a big part.
I'm saying toggle.
No,

785
00:46:21.570 --> 00:46:24.600
it's like there's a thing about peace and just don't want,

786
00:46:25.110 --> 00:46:28.350
there's something people don't like about dentists or somehow that it said

787
00:46:28.351 --> 00:46:30.870
something to the people that he was a dentist.
I don't fully understand it.

788
00:46:31.110 --> 00:46:36.110
People loved pointing out that that man was a dentist somehow it just made it

789
00:46:38.131 --> 00:46:41.520
seem just really egregious.
Well,
one of those guys,

790
00:46:41.521 --> 00:46:45.110
it's like one of the big game hunters that um,

791
00:46:45.630 --> 00:46:46.620
he's got a super,

792
00:46:46.710 --> 00:46:51.120
he's got like the Super Slam and the Grand Slam and he's always on that Tom

793
00:46:51.120 --> 00:46:54.420
Miranda show.
He's a surgeon.
No,
he's a surgeon.

794
00:46:54.630 --> 00:46:59.630
It's like one of the more famous guys that's a involved in the world of a bow

795
00:46:59.851 --> 00:47:04.770
hunting.
He's killed everything that walks with a bow.
It might be,
they have,

796
00:47:04.840 --> 00:47:05.100
you know,

797
00:47:05.100 --> 00:47:09.460
they have the disposable income and a flexible schedule in order to do that sort

798
00:47:09.461 --> 00:47:13.800
of hunting.
Maybe Brian counts.
Dentist is apparently some crazy big game hunter.

799
00:47:14.130 --> 00:47:18.340
No.
All right.
It's a common thing amongst dentists,
but yeah,
I think if that guy,

800
00:47:18.560 --> 00:47:22.980
there's a handful of things that I think could have gone differently if they had

801
00:47:22.990 --> 00:47:25.080
eaten that damn line.
Yeah,

802
00:47:25.081 --> 00:47:29.770
but you wouldn't go kill the deadline to yeah.
Without a doubt.

803
00:47:29.850 --> 00:47:33.940
Audi deadline.
What do you think it would taste like?
Shit.
No,

804
00:47:34.750 --> 00:47:36.430
it tastes like whatever.
Even if I had to take the whole,

805
00:47:36.431 --> 00:47:39.310
I'll take the whole thing and grinded up and make pepperoni sticks out of it.

806
00:47:40.540 --> 00:47:43.060
Dude,
I'd walk around,
I'd come and do a party and be like,
hey man,

807
00:47:43.061 --> 00:47:44.860
I brought you 30 pepperoni sticks,
Bro.

808
00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:50.620
I can feel like he should have,
well,
you hate a coyote on your show.

809
00:47:51.190 --> 00:47:55.390
If he had known,
I think that he,
if he had known what it was going to wind up,

810
00:47:55.570 --> 00:47:59.020
he would have never shot it.
That's what he said.
If he had known it,
he said it.

811
00:47:59.050 --> 00:48:01.990
I think he said if he'd known it had a name he wouldn't have shot.
Yeah.

812
00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:05.560
Well the craziest thing was,
I don't know.
I don't know what that means.

813
00:48:05.960 --> 00:48:08.170
<v 3>Brother Jericho has,
he had the,</v>

814
00:48:08.240 --> 00:48:11.600
Cecil had a brother named Jericho and they'd said that Jericho was now going to

815
00:48:11.601 --> 00:48:16.310
take care of Cecil's young bull shit.
First of all,
like that's not real.

816
00:48:16.430 --> 00:48:17.270
And second of all,

817
00:48:17.600 --> 00:48:21.770
they thought Jericho had gotten killed because another line had gotten killed

818
00:48:21.771 --> 00:48:22.500
and he attributed,

819
00:48:22.500 --> 00:48:27.080
they thought it was Jericho and then they found out w great relief.

820
00:48:27.110 --> 00:48:31.110
The lion that was killed was not Jericho whose just some no name,

821
00:48:31.460 --> 00:48:34.490
no name that nobody carries cash line,

822
00:48:35.090 --> 00:48:38.810
but it's the idea of giving a lion in name like your dog.

823
00:48:39.230 --> 00:48:42.530
It's not like some wild animal.
All of a sudden it's a pet.

824
00:48:42.590 --> 00:48:47.060
It's a pet that's in a park and that's how a lot of people that don't go to

825
00:48:47.061 --> 00:48:51.290
Africa don't have anything invested in keeping the people around.

826
00:48:51.291 --> 00:48:56.291
They're safe or they have this idea that it's like the lion king and the,

827
00:48:56.481 --> 00:49:00.390
there's some evil hunter is going to go over there and steal decapitated like

828
00:49:00.391 --> 00:49:02.420
the,
the language would they use.
First of all,

829
00:49:02.421 --> 00:49:04.010
they said he shot it with a crossbow.

830
00:49:04.160 --> 00:49:08.480
I saw that and were like reputable newspapers.
Like he didn't use a crossbow.

831
00:49:08.510 --> 00:49:12.530
That's not true.
Decapitated at it.
Well yeah,
that's what you do.

832
00:49:12.531 --> 00:49:15.500
If you want to take the hide,
you have to cut the head off the rest of the body.

833
00:49:17.540 --> 00:49:22.460
<v 4>Man.
It's like such that issue is such a black hole,</v>

834
00:49:23.240 --> 00:49:24.710
but I think that the people,

835
00:49:24.770 --> 00:49:27.500
I mean it just like has this way and it was kind of the one the ways was most

836
00:49:27.501 --> 00:49:30.080
upsetting to me when it was going on.
Thankfully I was gone for a lot of it,

837
00:49:30.110 --> 00:49:30.943
but uh,

838
00:49:31.790 --> 00:49:35.690
it just had this way of like acting like a black hole or like we envision a

839
00:49:35.691 --> 00:49:39.320
black hole being or just sucks everything around it,

840
00:49:39.830 --> 00:49:44.570
into this thing where it became like the dominant discussion about hunting.

841
00:49:44.590 --> 00:49:47.780
I think that one of the most telling things about it is the people who seem to

842
00:49:47.781 --> 00:49:52.781
be most upset by it or the people who had to least nuanced understanding of

843
00:49:55.251 --> 00:49:59.680
wildlife management,
wildlife politics and wildlife in general and

844
00:50:00.190 --> 00:50:05.190
<v 3>just the least understanding of what it means to eat meat in the first place.</v>

845
00:50:05.950 --> 00:50:08.440
I looked at all these people that were protesting in front of his,

846
00:50:08.530 --> 00:50:12.370
his dental practice.
I'm like,
you can't tell me you fuckers are vegetarians.

847
00:50:12.610 --> 00:50:16.130
Your big fat,
sloppy faces.
This is,
these are not vegans.
Yeah,

848
00:50:16.330 --> 00:50:17.950
these are not healthy people.
I mean,

849
00:50:17.951 --> 00:50:20.050
this is not people that are eating a bunch of salads.

850
00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:24.130
These are people that probably got burgers on the way to put in those fucking

851
00:50:24.131 --> 00:50:24.964
signs up.

852
00:50:25.230 --> 00:50:27.090
<v 4>I had an FBI,
I had one,</v>

853
00:50:27.230 --> 00:50:32.230
I had to have the FBI look into a guy who was mass let me a little bit and this

854
00:50:33.831 --> 00:50:38.180
agent came over my house and um,
he was,
he's like,

855
00:50:38.181 --> 00:50:42.890
I can tell you that guy's not a Vegan or he's not a vegetarian.
I said,
the guy,

856
00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:46.220
you're talking about how the guy had just ordered a pepperoni pizza,

857
00:50:46.820 --> 00:50:50.900
which a momma,
I'm like,
dude,
the why you have such a problem with me.
Yeah.

858
00:50:51.290 --> 00:50:52.610
What the Hell you think dad is?

859
00:50:52.650 --> 00:50:54.480
<v 3>Because it's a target.
You're a target.</v>

860
00:50:54.530 --> 00:50:57.030
There's people aren't looking at things rationally.

861
00:50:57.240 --> 00:51:00.480
I think they're finding green lights.
Like there's a green light.

862
00:51:00.481 --> 00:51:05.460
I'm frustrated by my life.
I don't like my job.
I don't like my social position.

863
00:51:05.730 --> 00:51:08.490
I don't like my,
my whole,

864
00:51:09.270 --> 00:51:14.010
the whole life that I've carved out for myself and I find green lights and I see

865
00:51:14.011 --> 00:51:17.070
those green lights and I could just point my anger in that direction instead of

866
00:51:17.071 --> 00:51:21.120
focusing inwardly instead of looking at what aspects of my life that I should

867
00:51:21.121 --> 00:51:24.990
change.
Maybe I'd have a more harmonious existence.
Maybe I'd be happier,

868
00:51:24.991 --> 00:51:29.340
maybe I'd be more fulfilled.
Nope.
They just find someone like this fucking guy.

869
00:51:29.550 --> 00:51:33.330
What are you fucking,
you're a hunter.
Good Little Bic,
your little Dick.

870
00:51:33.331 --> 00:51:34.680
You're going to fix it with a rifle.

871
00:51:34.860 --> 00:51:39.060
There's like these cliches that they always throw about and then they'll go eat

872
00:51:39.090 --> 00:51:41.580
a pepperoni pizza and it's like,
oh my God.

873
00:51:41.610 --> 00:51:44.580
Do you know what's involved in making pepperoni?
Do you,

874
00:51:44.890 --> 00:51:47.880
if you're ever gone to a slaughter house,
do you know what,
uh,
what,

875
00:51:47.940 --> 00:51:51.360
what existence these animals have before they get snuffed out?

876
00:51:51.630 --> 00:51:56.340
It's a horrific existence.
The existence of a wild animals infinitely better.

877
00:51:56.550 --> 00:52:01.550
And the distance between or the time between the wild animal even knowing that

878
00:52:01.621 --> 00:52:04.620
you're alive and being dead is like that.

879
00:52:04.950 --> 00:52:09.950
I can be tip can be the difference between that and an animal that lives in

880
00:52:10.351 --> 00:52:14.610
captivity and gets turned into sausage or Pepperoni or whatever the fuck it is.

881
00:52:14.670 --> 00:52:18.600
That's horrific.
And the idea that someone who buys cat food,

882
00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:23.720
somebody buys chicken cat food can get mad at someone who goes out and hunts a

883
00:52:24.151 --> 00:52:29.130
grouse or Hunt's a duck.
It's madness.
It's just madness.

884
00:52:29.460 --> 00:52:33.200
I wrote this thing about the hierarchy of um,

885
00:52:33.450 --> 00:52:36.780
of dead animals on social media and I showed what you can get away with what you

886
00:52:36.781 --> 00:52:40.620
can't get away with.
I'm like cut up fish.
Nobody really gives a fuck.

887
00:52:40.820 --> 00:52:45.060
You could show a dead fish and it's a little sketchier like,

888
00:52:45.420 --> 00:52:50.010
<v 4>but you could show a steak that you've cooked.
Very few people get upset,</v>

889
00:52:50.480 --> 00:52:54.420
but if you show an actual animal that's dead,
people get really upset.

890
00:52:54.450 --> 00:52:56.360
Why do people get pissed about forever?

891
00:52:56.370 --> 00:52:58.680
They don't get pissed about leather couches.
It's kid pulling.

892
00:52:58.690 --> 00:53:02.100
Someone scraped all the fur off.
Exactly.
As soon as you scraped the fur off,

893
00:53:02.101 --> 00:53:03.480
you were like,
that's awesome man.

894
00:53:03.481 --> 00:53:06.060
I'll buy a pair of shoes and I'll take that in a jacket as well.

895
00:53:06.180 --> 00:53:08.640
Can I get a belt if you leave the hair on it.
They fought.

896
00:53:08.670 --> 00:53:11.220
They just do not like it.
Well,
because we're mammals,

897
00:53:11.221 --> 00:53:13.230
it's really disturbing to and leave the hair on it.

898
00:53:13.260 --> 00:53:16.620
They much prefer you to take that stuff and throw it in the trash and then use

899
00:53:16.621 --> 00:53:20.970
it as leather.
But if it doesn't have hair,
like a snake skin belt,
that's cool.

900
00:53:21.120 --> 00:53:25.950
Yeah.
Yeah.
Another thing that really bum me out,

901
00:53:26.900 --> 00:53:31.320
<v 2>um,
about our,
you know,
our,
our,
our dentist friend,</v>

902
00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:36.290
is that
what I'm talking about Honeywell?

903
00:53:36.590 --> 00:53:41.590
One of the things I'd like to try to promote or try to explain is in a term I

904
00:53:42.451 --> 00:53:47.451
use a lot is trying to form a context

905
00:53:49.630 --> 00:53:54.590
with the land where you hunt and establishing a context with,

906
00:53:54.670 --> 00:53:55.900
with the animals you hunt,

907
00:53:56.380 --> 00:54:01.380
meaning that you understand your place in the world and you understand the world

908
00:54:01.811 --> 00:54:03.400
that you're walking into.
Have you,

909
00:54:03.401 --> 00:54:07.180
have you ever heard of the rider Aldo Leopold who wrote Sand County Almanac?

910
00:54:07.270 --> 00:54:08.740
Yeah,
I've heard his name.
Okay.
Um,

911
00:54:08.780 --> 00:54:11.410
there was not familiar with us when he was writing in the forties,
and he was,

912
00:54:11.440 --> 00:54:16.270
he was kind of the,
the,
the,
he's like the grand pappy of hunter conservationist.

913
00:54:17.050 --> 00:54:22.010
I recently had occasion to reread his book because I went to,
um,
uh,

914
00:54:22.440 --> 00:54:25.030
I,
I gave a talk at the University of Wisconsin.

915
00:54:25.031 --> 00:54:27.300
It was sponsored in part by the Aldo Leopold Foundation.

916
00:54:27.301 --> 00:54:30.640
So I re-read all the Leopold's sand county Almanac,

917
00:54:30.641 --> 00:54:35.410
and he was a hunter in the forties.
And,
um,
relative to the forties,

918
00:54:35.411 --> 00:54:38.260
we live in the good old days.
Um,
we have phenomenal,

919
00:54:38.650 --> 00:54:42.790
phenomenal hunting and fishing here in this country.
Um,
in the forties sucked.

920
00:54:43.180 --> 00:54:47.590
Okay.
In the thirties really sucked.
Um,
there was,
you know,

921
00:54:47.780 --> 00:54:51.100
very few hunting seasons for anything.
Most things were just gone.

922
00:54:51.101 --> 00:54:55.870
Habitat destruction was,
you know,
off the charts.
Uh,

923
00:54:56.170 --> 00:54:59.650
you couldn't,
you could legally hunt turkeys almost nowhere.

924
00:54:59.651 --> 00:55:04.150
Waterfall was just about wiped out dear just about wiped out.
So now,

925
00:55:04.210 --> 00:55:06.250
like if all the Leopold could be alive now,

926
00:55:06.251 --> 00:55:09.580
he'd see a lot that would make him very,
very happy.
Um,

927
00:55:09.730 --> 00:55:14.080
because we've done such a good job on this continent with wildlife management,

928
00:55:14.410 --> 00:55:19.090
but in his book,
he pushes this idea,
he's talking about hunting,

929
00:55:19.900 --> 00:55:22.990
but he's using the metaphor of,
of a,
of a forester.
Okay.

930
00:55:22.991 --> 00:55:26.320
Cause he had been trained in forestry and worked in forestry and he talked about

931
00:55:26.321 --> 00:55:30.850
how a forester,
or you might say a hunter,

932
00:55:31.240 --> 00:55:32.073
um,

933
00:55:33.540 --> 00:55:38.340
goes out on the land and with each stroke of his acts,

934
00:55:39.330 --> 00:55:43.560
his writing,
his signature on the land with each swing of an ax.

935
00:55:44.420 --> 00:55:46.260
And when I say that he's talking about hunting because he's kind of talking

936
00:55:46.261 --> 00:55:50.280
about this in the conversation with hunting.
Meaning when you go out on the land,

937
00:55:50.730 --> 00:55:55.290
you are like writing your signature out there.
You know,
you're,

938
00:55:55.291 --> 00:55:56.760
you're building a legacy.
You're,

939
00:55:56.761 --> 00:56:01.761
you're making decisions and having implications for the landscape impacting it.

940
00:56:04.500 --> 00:56:06.630
What it seemed to be with that guy.

941
00:56:06.631 --> 00:56:09.030
I think one of the things that upset me about that guy,

942
00:56:09.031 --> 00:56:13.080
and that might have upset other people about that guy,
the shot the lion,

943
00:56:13.440 --> 00:56:17.280
was that he seemed to claim,
um,

944
00:56:18.230 --> 00:56:22.440
he,
he,
he seemed to be claiming in some way that he just had no idea,

945
00:56:23.560 --> 00:56:28.450
didn't know where he was,
didn't know what was up with the line,

946
00:56:28.451 --> 00:56:32.410
didn't know the lion,
had a collar and be like,
I just didn't know.
You know,

947
00:56:33.520 --> 00:56:36.340
I think that in some ways,
obviously you're in another country.

948
00:56:36.370 --> 00:56:39.700
It's hard to follow what's going on.
You rely on other people's judgment.

949
00:56:40.120 --> 00:56:43.060
But in some ways I think it was upsetting to people that he wasn't doing,

950
00:56:43.061 --> 00:56:48.061
like he wasn't following that thing that Leopold set out about right.

951
00:56:48.361 --> 00:56:50.950
And your signature on the land because I,
it was sort of like,

952
00:56:50.951 --> 00:56:53.800
he just had no idea where he was,
what he was doing.

953
00:56:54.070 --> 00:56:55.540
And I think that when you hunt,

954
00:56:56.830 --> 00:57:01.830
you do have an obligation to understand your role and your place.

955
00:57:03.070 --> 00:57:06.880
Okay.
And understand the context that you're working in.

956
00:57:07.870 --> 00:57:12.870
What are the limits and the needs of the resource you're trying to exploit?

957
00:57:13.750 --> 00:57:16.420
Can the resource withstand exploitation?

958
00:57:16.810 --> 00:57:21.810
Are you generally behaving as a force that's ultimately for or ultimately

959
00:57:22.541 --> 00:57:25.390
against wildlife?
Like you have an obligation to answer all these questions.

960
00:57:25.840 --> 00:57:30.490
You can go in a situation like that and rely on the judgment of someone else,

961
00:57:31.210 --> 00:57:35.170
but that judgment can get really confused.
I think when money enters the picture,

962
00:57:35.680 --> 00:57:40.090
you know,
but the money thing's funny too because people were very upset.

963
00:57:40.810 --> 00:57:44.780
I was joking earlier about them being them.
I was joking about the dentist thing.

964
00:57:44.781 --> 00:57:46.660
It was just funny the how often it was pointed out,

965
00:57:46.661 --> 00:57:49.570
his occupation was pointed out,
but what I'm not joking about,

966
00:57:49.960 --> 00:57:54.460
his people were very,
very upset about the amount of money,
the traded hands,

967
00:57:55.300 --> 00:57:59.110
which puzzled me because the old narrative

968
00:58:00.670 --> 00:58:05.670
from a century ago was that people of European descent go into Africa and take

969
00:58:09.311 --> 00:58:11.440
resources and pay for nothing.

970
00:58:12.310 --> 00:58:16.750
Did we go there and just rob the place of its resources and we take what we want

971
00:58:16.751 --> 00:58:21.570
and we leave and we don't pay a dime for it.
That was upsetting.

972
00:58:21.580 --> 00:58:24.210
It is upsetting to me now.

973
00:58:24.270 --> 00:58:29.270
It's like he's being criticized for paying too much for a resource is like any

974
00:58:31.471 --> 00:58:35.670
paid or like the guy that he paid 350,000 for a rhino w it would it be better to

975
00:58:35.671 --> 00:58:37.140
you if you paid $5?

976
00:58:37.860 --> 00:58:42.860
It would seem to me that him having expressed the value of the animal in some

977
00:58:44.251 --> 00:58:48.900
way is almost a compliment to the pursuit rather than just going in there and

978
00:58:48.901 --> 00:58:50.790
robbing what you want and never paying for anything.

979
00:58:50.900 --> 00:58:52.970
<v 3>That makes sense.
But I think a lot of people have an idea,</v>

980
00:58:53.410 --> 00:58:57.140
a real problem with the idea of putting a value on life at all.

981
00:58:57.200 --> 00:59:02.200
Like saying that it's $350,000 you can go kill an endangered animal instead of

982
00:59:02.960 --> 00:59:07.960
the real issue is they that animal was killing w we've talking about the rhino.

983
00:59:08.380 --> 00:59:12.080
Yeah,
the danger.
I'm doing a Brian Williams,
I'm conflating the,

984
00:59:12.830 --> 00:59:14.570
they had a real problem with that rhino.

985
00:59:14.690 --> 00:59:18.050
They had a real problem with these older non-viable rhinos because they were

986
00:59:18.051 --> 00:59:19.580
killing young rhinos.

987
00:59:19.730 --> 00:59:23.120
They killed this rhino had a female and in the,

988
00:59:23.150 --> 00:59:27.680
the NPR piece,
the uh,
excuse me,
the um,
radio lab piece,

989
00:59:28.100 --> 00:59:33.100
they actually found the dead bodies of this female and a male that this rhino

990
00:59:34.351 --> 00:59:38.790
who had killed like they,
he took them to the spots.
The guy who,

991
00:59:38.840 --> 00:59:39.870
the professional hunter.

992
00:59:39.900 --> 00:59:43.880
So you know in Africa they have these things called professional hunters where

993
00:59:43.881 --> 00:59:45.530
you would think,
call them a guide in America.

994
00:59:45.740 --> 00:59:50.450
But they took them to the spot where there's the bones were of this female,

995
00:59:50.600 --> 00:59:55.280
I mean this,
this rhino really fucked this young female to death.
I'm like,

996
00:59:55.281 --> 00:59:58.820
he kept mounting her and fucking her and,
and,
and horning her,

997
00:59:59.030 --> 01:00:04.030
hitting him with his horns and wound up killing her and killed a male who had,

998
01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:07.310
you know,
gotten in the area and wanted to breed with the female too.

999
01:00:07.311 --> 01:00:09.380
So he had killed two other rhinos.

1000
01:00:09.590 --> 01:00:14.270
They had targeted him anyway because he was dangerous to the population cause he

1001
01:00:14.271 --> 01:00:15.380
was killing breeding males.

1002
01:00:15.740 --> 01:00:20.740
The money that had come in from that $350,000 at that guy gave was going to stop

1003
01:00:20.931 --> 01:00:25.670
poaching,
was going to protect the environment that this animal lived in.

1004
01:00:25.870 --> 01:00:29.750
It was going to protect habitat.
So the,
the argument is real.

1005
01:00:29.870 --> 01:00:34.730
It's real weird because on one hand it does seem strange that we're talking

1006
01:00:34.731 --> 01:00:38.450
about value for life like that this life would be valuable.
But another hand,

1007
01:00:39.050 --> 01:00:43.250
the real value is like you've got to kill this thing anyway because it's a non

1008
01:00:43.251 --> 01:00:44.270
breeding male.

1009
01:00:44.900 --> 01:00:48.320
Either kill it or you have to capture it and take it somewhere and make it live

1010
01:00:48.321 --> 01:00:50.060
in a cage.
But if you kill it,

1011
01:00:50.420 --> 01:00:53.900
this guy's willing to pay you $350,000 and he was saying that that was

1012
01:00:53.901 --> 01:00:56.690
undervalued and that if there wasn't so much bad press,

1013
01:00:56.930 --> 01:00:59.330
they would have probably been over half a million.

1014
01:00:59.540 --> 01:01:00.311
<v 4>Yeah.
If a,</v>

1015
01:01:00.311 --> 01:01:04.190
if they had had a park ranger go out or some kind of land manager go out and

1016
01:01:04.191 --> 01:01:07.820
shoot it and act like,
you know,
just something that had to be done.
You know,

1017
01:01:08.180 --> 01:01:10.190
there would be no pro,
the guy would've been applauded,

1018
01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:12.860
but they would lose all the money and all that money that would go

1019
01:01:13.010 --> 01:01:14.930
<v 3>wildlife PR,
the,
the two,
uh,</v>

1020
01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:18.680
preservation of the land and protecting of the habitat,

1021
01:01:18.681 --> 01:01:20.900
all that money will be gone.
Protecting against poaching.

1022
01:01:21.450 --> 01:01:22.970
It's one of those things in life.

1023
01:01:23.370 --> 01:01:27.180
<v 4>It's not clean.
No.
I was reading this morning,
uh,</v>

1024
01:01:27.210 --> 01:01:32.160
this article in the New Yorker by Adam Gopnik and he was writing about,
um,

1025
01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:35.220
he's actually writing a piece about books about the Holocaust,

1026
01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:38.430
but in there he had this line that stuck with me,

1027
01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:42.630
or at least it stuck with me for the last few hours where he said that,
um,

1028
01:01:43.860 --> 01:01:48.860
something to the effect of the only way to simplify history is to make a

1029
01:01:49.051 --> 01:01:53.340
complex.
You know,
it's like anytime,

1030
01:01:54.300 --> 01:01:58.590
any real explanation of something,
particularly with wildlife,

1031
01:02:00.430 --> 01:02:05.430
you don't get any real aha moments until you get into the deep complexities

1032
01:02:06.761 --> 01:02:07.594
surrounding the issue.

1033
01:02:08.830 --> 01:02:12.160
I think that's how we can sit here and all these,

1034
01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:17.400
whatever number of months after that and I can sit here and still hold in my

1035
01:02:17.531 --> 01:02:22.130
hand or hold in my hand simultaneously a disdain

1036
01:02:23.030 --> 01:02:26.000
<v 3>for this guy and what he stood for.</v>

1037
01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:29.290
<v 4>We can talk about the line like some kind of disdain for it.</v>

1038
01:02:29.490 --> 01:02:30.700
It's something about it.
I just like,

1039
01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:34.780
it's a visceral reaction about some of the things I know about what went on and

1040
01:02:34.781 --> 01:02:39.730
what might've been in people's mind and at the same time disdain for the general

1041
01:02:39.731 --> 01:02:44.380
public for feeling the disdain that they felt.

1042
01:02:44.950 --> 01:02:49.810
It's like I just see it as such a big thing that I haven't really made that much

1043
01:02:49.811 --> 01:02:54.040
sense out of it and when I,
whenever I get that conflicted about an issue,

1044
01:02:55.340 --> 01:02:59.260
<v 3>I started to feel like I'm getting somewhere.
That's fascinating.</v>

1045
01:02:59.810 --> 01:03:03.250
Why do you feel like you're getting somewhere when you get conflicted?
Because

1046
01:03:03.310 --> 01:03:06.700
<v 4>then I realized that I'm probably seeing it from the necessary number of angles.</v>

1047
01:03:07.190 --> 01:03:07.371
<v 3>Well,</v>

1048
01:03:07.371 --> 01:03:10.610
it is one of those things where there are a bunch of different angles to look at

1049
01:03:10.611 --> 01:03:12.770
it and it is complex because this guy,

1050
01:03:12.771 --> 01:03:16.660
whether or not the Zimbabwe government cleared him of any wrongdoing,

1051
01:03:16.670 --> 01:03:20.930
which they did,
he's still tampered with the collar,
which is illegal.

1052
01:03:21.020 --> 01:03:24.590
He still was a poacher.

1053
01:03:24.650 --> 01:03:26.750
He had been convicted of poaching already.

1054
01:03:26.930 --> 01:03:30.890
He had a killed a bear 40 miles outside the area that he cleaned it and kill it.

1055
01:03:31.070 --> 01:03:35.600
Tried to bribe the people that he was with two claim that he killed it in an

1056
01:03:35.610 --> 01:03:40.400
illegal area.
So this guy was already unethical.
So he was,

1057
01:03:40.670 --> 01:03:45.560
he was a perfect guy to pin all this on.
Yeah,
but you want to say like,
okay,
yeah,

1058
01:03:45.890 --> 01:03:50.480
this guy was an asshole dude.
Some asshole stuff.
Right.

1059
01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:55.430
What does that mean?
That we're not going to manage large predators but,

1060
01:03:55.520 --> 01:03:58.970
and I want to be like,
do we have to manage lions?
I mean,

1061
01:03:58.971 --> 01:04:01.160
is this a critical issue like it is with wolves.

1062
01:04:01.161 --> 01:04:05.120
Like you're talking about the wolf population getting out of control and this is

1063
01:04:05.121 --> 01:04:10.020
from a by a biological wildlife management standpoint.
Like the,

1064
01:04:10.021 --> 01:04:15.021
the guys who are wildlife biologists gave a number that they think a wolf

1065
01:04:15.501 --> 01:04:18.860
population should reach before it should start being managed.

1066
01:04:19.010 --> 01:04:22.010
That number's been far exceeded.
And when that number was exceeded,

1067
01:04:22.190 --> 01:04:25.590
that's when all the blowback came back where they were saying,
no,
no,
no,
we,

1068
01:04:25.591 --> 01:04:28.700
we've changed our mind.
We don't want to open up a hunting season.

1069
01:04:28.910 --> 01:04:33.590
And that became a real issue because then the elk population dropped radically.

1070
01:04:33.591 --> 01:04:36.680
Then the deer population dropped radically and then there was all these positive

1071
01:04:36.681 --> 01:04:41.180
spins on it.
Like did you,
uh,
there was this one guy who,
um,

1072
01:04:41.330 --> 01:04:44.240
there's another rate,
a radio law,
the guy that said,
Tom,

1073
01:04:44.241 --> 01:04:48.310
the guy that like the how we'll say it.
And it was for,
yeah,

1074
01:04:48.320 --> 01:04:52.550
that guy is fascinating because that guys,
I saw that piece and I thought,
well,

1075
01:04:52.551 --> 01:04:57.551
maybe this guy has making some interesting points until I listen to this ted,

1076
01:04:58.490 --> 01:05:02.710
a podcast about him recently where he's talking about reintroducing wolves or

1077
01:05:02.930 --> 01:05:06.860
reintroducing lions and even hippos to England.

1078
01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:10.430
Because he thinks that at one point in time,
and it,
you know,

1079
01:05:10.431 --> 01:05:15.431
they found in London they found like ancient bones of lions and he thinks

1080
01:05:15.621 --> 01:05:20.621
bringing megafauna to of the UK would be beneficial to this areas of the UK.

1081
01:05:21.341 --> 01:05:23.980
You know,
millions of Hector's.
Yeah.
How'd he say it?

1082
01:05:23.981 --> 01:05:28.420
Hector's Hector's Hector's that are not being used and utilized and they could

1083
01:05:28.421 --> 01:05:33.421
turn it into a wildlife park with fucking lions and this is all the result of a

1084
01:05:35.140 --> 01:05:38.110
self admitted midlife crisis this guy had,

1085
01:05:38.380 --> 01:05:40.960
so he got interested in the concept of rewilding.

1086
01:05:41.050 --> 01:05:43.570
<v 4>I'm ignorant.
I'm interested in the concept,
the rewilding,</v>

1087
01:05:43.571 --> 01:05:44.800
and I'm interested in the concept,

1088
01:05:44.801 --> 01:05:48.880
the rewilding in that if you can correct mistakes,

1089
01:05:49.940 --> 01:05:50.690
if,

1090
01:05:50.690 --> 01:05:55.690
if you can correct extra patients or let's say scientific,

1091
01:05:56.321 --> 01:05:58.750
you had the ability to correct extinctions,
but just you can't,

1092
01:05:58.751 --> 01:06:00.070
so we'll not talk about that for right now.

1093
01:06:00.370 --> 01:06:05.110
If you could correct experts x or patients like regional extinctions of animals

1094
01:06:05.350 --> 01:06:07.420
that were brought on by human causes,

1095
01:06:08.170 --> 01:06:13.170
then I think we have a moral obligation to remedy those mistakes.

1096
01:06:15.430 --> 01:06:16.121
Elk,
okay.

1097
01:06:16.121 --> 01:06:21.121
The American elk only occupies 10% of its native range.

1098
01:06:23.620 --> 01:06:27.160
Elk live in 10% of the land in the u s that they lived in at the time of

1099
01:06:27.161 --> 01:06:28.000
European contact.

1100
01:06:29.200 --> 01:06:32.230
No one talks about elk being endangered

1101
01:06:34.450 --> 01:06:38.560
are near extinction even though they're absent from 90% of their range.

1102
01:06:38.710 --> 01:06:39.543
Why is that?

1103
01:06:40.570 --> 01:06:40.970
<v 0>Okay,</v>

1104
01:06:40.970 --> 01:06:45.650
<v 4>because we,
because there are many areas where they abound,</v>

1105
01:06:46.400 --> 01:06:49.520
so we've come able to go like yes,

1106
01:06:49.790 --> 01:06:54.380
elk are missing from areas and there's a number of groups.
Many state agencies,

1107
01:06:54.390 --> 01:06:59.390
most notably the rocky mountain elk foundation work to where plausible bring elk

1108
01:07:00.081 --> 01:07:03.680
back to areas in the east that used to have him.

1109
01:07:03.740 --> 01:07:07.400
The no longer do in my lifetime,
elk have come back to Michigan,

1110
01:07:07.790 --> 01:07:12.590
Pennsylvania,
Kentucky,
and on and on and on through reintroduction efforts.
Okay,

1111
01:07:12.591 --> 01:07:14.210
so we're working to repopulate elk.

1112
01:07:14.540 --> 01:07:19.540
The biggest piece of resistance you get on repopulating elk is public approval.

1113
01:07:20.660 --> 01:07:21.800
People don't want to be inconvenienced,

1114
01:07:21.801 --> 01:07:24.440
but big ass animals that they're going to hit with their cars and they don't

1115
01:07:24.441 --> 01:07:29.270
want to be inconvenienced by animals eat crops.
So that's the resistance.

1116
01:07:29.271 --> 01:07:32.360
The resistance is that it's just that we don't have the technology for it.

1117
01:07:32.390 --> 01:07:34.010
It's just that people got to get public approval.

1118
01:07:34.100 --> 01:07:36.200
So we're trying to bring them back.
Meanwhile,

1119
01:07:36.470 --> 01:07:41.030
we have hunting seasons for elk all over the place.
Right.

1120
01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:45.830
I mean just down the line you got elk seasons,
Montana,

1121
01:07:45.860 --> 01:07:50.270
Wyoming,
Colorado,
Arizona,
Utah,
Idaho,

1122
01:07:50.330 --> 01:07:51.860
California,
Nevada.

1123
01:07:55.270 --> 01:07:57.790
While they're gone from other places,
you know,

1124
01:07:58.630 --> 01:08:03.550
why is it that we can't extend the same logic to the wolf and say,
yeah,

1125
01:08:03.580 --> 01:08:07.330
the Wolf's absent for much of its range and most of it in some of its range,

1126
01:08:07.390 --> 01:08:08.223
its thriving.

1127
01:08:08.380 --> 01:08:13.000
We're going to manage the areas that are thriving and we're going to work toward

1128
01:08:13.150 --> 01:08:17.900
bringing wolves back to the areas where they're not the same way that hunters by

1129
01:08:17.901 --> 01:08:19.520
and large,
not even by and large

1130
01:08:19.830 --> 01:08:24.210
<v 1>solely hunters are responsible for bringing them elk back all over the place.</v>

1131
01:08:24.510 --> 01:08:28.620
But I think the way the general public looks at things is very different from

1132
01:08:28.621 --> 01:08:29.980
the way that you're looking at things.
You're,

1133
01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.550
you're looking at these animals as a renewable resource.

1134
01:08:32.640 --> 01:08:36.130
The general public looks at them as magical creatures that live in the forest.

1135
01:08:36.131 --> 01:08:40.170
And that we need to bring back because we made them extinct because we're greedy

1136
01:08:40.171 --> 01:08:42.690
and vicious and fall.
Yeah,
we're cause we're,
we're fundamentally flawed.

1137
01:08:42.750 --> 01:08:47.100
And on top of that,
we talking about animals you eat versus elk versus animals.

1138
01:08:47.101 --> 01:08:49.830
You don't eat wolves.
Why do you want to kill these walls?

1139
01:08:49.950 --> 01:08:53.130
You must be a cruel person who wants to go out and kill something and it looks

1140
01:08:53.131 --> 01:08:56.920
like a dog cause to people.
Wolves are these magical creatures.
Yeah.

1141
01:08:57.170 --> 01:09:01.110
Ooh,
here it.
Well,
you're a wolf.
Wow,
that's cool.

1142
01:09:01.260 --> 01:09:04.230
And it is cool to hear a wall,
but I like wolves more than those people do.

1143
01:09:04.290 --> 01:09:07.110
Do you think so?
Why do you think you like them more?

1144
01:09:07.350 --> 01:09:09.240
I just have more familiarity with them.

1145
01:09:10.250 --> 01:09:12.500
<v 4>I go to more places where they might be found.</v>

1146
01:09:12.710 --> 01:09:15.800
I like spend more time looking through my binoculars,
trying to find them.

1147
01:09:16.280 --> 01:09:19.490
I just am more interested in them.
I like them more.
It means more to me.

1148
01:09:19.640 --> 01:09:23.660
Not every one of them,
but your average guy that's never even laid eyes on one.

1149
01:09:23.690 --> 01:09:26.570
I have more of an appreciation for the animal than they do.
I'm sorry,

1150
01:09:26.571 --> 01:09:29.870
that sounds like a bold offensive statement,
but I just do it.

1151
01:09:29.930 --> 01:09:31.760
<v 1>I would back you up on that.
I think you do.</v>

1152
01:09:31.820 --> 01:09:36.410
But I think I like grizzly bears a whole bunch.
A whole bunch.

1153
01:09:36.660 --> 01:09:39.180
<v 4>I've been hunting for grizzly bears a lot.
Never shot a grizzly bear.</v>

1154
01:09:39.210 --> 01:09:42.540
I've never found the one I want to get in.
I will get one in my life.

1155
01:09:42.570 --> 01:09:45.960
Are you going to turn into pepperoni sticks?
No.
No.

1156
01:09:45.961 --> 01:09:48.150
I'm going to eat it straight up.
Really.
I do get one.

1157
01:09:48.180 --> 01:09:50.330
I just got back from spending 12 days looking for grizzly.

1158
01:09:50.331 --> 01:09:53.610
Why would you decide to eat it straight up and not turn into pepperoni sticks?

1159
01:09:54.240 --> 01:09:57.990
Because isn't it going to taste like shit?
No,
cause I hung them in the interior.

1160
01:09:58.320 --> 01:10:01.680
The areas where I go look,
you know,

1161
01:10:01.710 --> 01:10:05.580
anytime I've gone out with the intention of getting a grizzly bear,
um,

1162
01:10:06.900 --> 01:10:10.590
<v 1>I go to areas where they don't have access to fish purposely.
Yup.</v>

1163
01:10:10.830 --> 01:10:15.180
So that you can get a big on a big one that you want.
I want a mature male,

1164
01:10:15.720 --> 01:10:18.390
preferably one who tomorrow will die of old age.

1165
01:10:19.350 --> 01:10:22.700
And I want him to not be eating a lot of dead fish so that you can eat them.

1166
01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:26.370
Yeah.
Cam Haynes,
I showed you the pictures of the two grizzlies that he shot.

1167
01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:30.480
He's eating them now shoe in his way through them.
And I go,
how do they taste?

1168
01:10:30.481 --> 01:10:34.440
He's like,
they're fucking awful.
He goes,
I just eat them.
And I'm like,
man,

1169
01:10:34.470 --> 01:10:37.220
see I'm not interested in that.
Um,

1170
01:10:37.550 --> 01:10:42.550
unless it was for a legitimate wildlife conservation reason and I was going to

1171
01:10:44.431 --> 01:10:47.310
eat it.
I don't think I would be interested in hunting something like that.

1172
01:10:47.490 --> 01:10:49.410
I mean,
even if it was,

1173
01:10:50.220 --> 01:10:53.940
it's just if I'm going to spend my time hunting something,
I want to,

1174
01:10:53.941 --> 01:10:58.140
you want to eat it 100%.
That's the thing that,
that's,
that's my connection.

1175
01:10:58.170 --> 01:11:02.250
The hunting,
I grew up,
I told her about this handful of times I feel like,

1176
01:11:02.251 --> 01:11:05.400
but I'll say it again.
Like I grew up

1177
01:11:05.940 --> 01:11:07.620
<v 4>always hunting since before I can remember.</v>

1178
01:11:07.650 --> 01:11:11.430
But for long time I got interested in trapping and that's what I was going to do

1179
01:11:11.431 --> 01:11:12.900
for living.
Cause I was gonna be a fur trapper.

1180
01:11:13.190 --> 01:11:18.190
I caught my first mosque and I was 10 years old and the trout until I was 22 so

1181
01:11:18.211 --> 01:11:20.880
I trapped for 12 years.
And the latter part of that,

1182
01:11:20.881 --> 01:11:24.000
I was trying to do it where I was going to be a professional trapper.
All right,

1183
01:11:25.070 --> 01:11:28.770
I bet you quit trapping cause for markets got so low.
Um,

1184
01:11:29.490 --> 01:11:31.230
and moved away from home,

1185
01:11:32.220 --> 01:11:36.420
got more serious about college and started just feeding arm me and friends.

1186
01:11:36.421 --> 01:11:37.770
My brothers by that point in time,

1187
01:11:37.771 --> 01:11:42.270
we are feeding ourselves on wild game by no protein besides what we hunted for.

1188
01:11:43.470 --> 01:11:47.910
Um,
and at that point wasn't what I really like,

1189
01:11:47.940 --> 01:11:49.140
sort of found my,

1190
01:11:50.070 --> 01:11:53.460
my place in the natural world,
you know,

1191
01:11:53.461 --> 01:11:57.180
that was like the relationship with animals and the relationship with the

1192
01:11:57.181 --> 01:11:59.580
natural world and the relationship with hunting that

1193
01:12:01.190 --> 01:12:04.880
really spoke to me and made me feel very good about my decisions.

1194
01:12:04.881 --> 01:12:08.330
Very good about my lifestyle.
And,
and I've lived that lifestyle now,
you know,

1195
01:12:08.450 --> 01:12:11.150
for 20 some odd years.
Um,

1196
01:12:13.100 --> 01:12:15.710
but I did at a time.
Yeah,
I did trap,
you know,

1197
01:12:15.860 --> 01:12:20.810
and I would trap in order to sell the hides.
So one,

1198
01:12:20.811 --> 01:12:22.070
I now talk about

1199
01:12:23.590 --> 01:12:26.470
why I liked to hunt and then I don't want a hump or something I'm not going to

1200
01:12:26.471 --> 01:12:28.690
eat because that's just,
that's why I like the home for it.

1201
01:12:28.750 --> 01:12:32.620
I think did some hunters will look at that and act like you're a being divisive,

1202
01:12:33.310 --> 01:12:34.720
you know that you're being,

1203
01:12:35.260 --> 01:12:39.730
that you have this holier than thou attitude or somehow condemning all their

1204
01:12:39.731 --> 01:12:44.350
practices.
I'm just talking about what I like,
my approach will.

1205
01:12:44.380 --> 01:12:47.040
I like to do you know what to me is the,

1206
01:12:47.041 --> 01:12:50.980
the what to me is the value of an animal.
I think in many,

1207
01:12:50.981 --> 01:12:53.800
many cases when it comes to

1208
01:12:55.540 --> 01:13:00.460
Predator management,
I ain't,
there are many cases where your PR,

1209
01:13:00.490 --> 01:13:04.230
you're going to have harvest of predators that are just not going to,

1210
01:13:05.140 --> 01:13:08.710
there's not going to be a food driven harvest,
you know?
It's just not,

1211
01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:12.550
we're looking right now like in the same areas that were in the greater

1212
01:13:12.551 --> 01:13:14.740
Yellowstone ecosystem around glacier national park.

1213
01:13:15.010 --> 01:13:18.370
You're looking at coming up on a thing were to say anything to happen with

1214
01:13:18.371 --> 01:13:22.090
wolves is going to probably have to happen with grizzly bears there and many of

1215
01:13:22.091 --> 01:13:25.210
these areas,
they're getting way above objective.
Okay?

1216
01:13:25.480 --> 01:13:30.190
It's starting to have negative implications for prey animals.

1217
01:13:30.460 --> 01:13:34.810
It's having negative implications for people who use the land these bears have.

1218
01:13:34.900 --> 01:13:38.320
They're just not afraid of anything.
You know,

1219
01:13:38.380 --> 01:13:40.480
you go up in Alaska where grizzlies get haunted.

1220
01:13:40.810 --> 01:13:44.380
You can generally get up windows the thing,
let it get a smell of you.

1221
01:13:44.410 --> 01:13:49.000
It's going to take off.
Oftentimes,
typically the case in these areas,

1222
01:13:49.060 --> 01:13:51.910
they're drawn to the smell of humans.
No one can touch them.

1223
01:13:51.970 --> 01:13:54.430
They have ESA protection.
You know,

1224
01:13:55.090 --> 01:13:58.540
we had drawn out decades ago what recovery would look like.

1225
01:13:58.541 --> 01:14:03.070
We've far surpassed what recovery looks like.
It's gonna happen.

1226
01:14:03.490 --> 01:14:07.150
It's gonna be ugly,
but they're going to delist bears,
they're gonna put,

1227
01:14:07.151 --> 01:14:09.940
they're gonna dealers,
grizzly bears.
They're going to put grizzly bears,

1228
01:14:10.300 --> 01:14:12.460
understate management.
This is inevitable.

1229
01:14:12.490 --> 01:14:14.770
<v 3>They're going to put them under state management and Wyoming,</v>

1230
01:14:14.771 --> 01:14:19.030
Montana and Idaho and people are going to be killing grizzly bears,
some,

1231
01:14:19.031 --> 01:14:22.720
some limited amount and their probably then there probably is not going to be a

1232
01:14:22.721 --> 01:14:25.030
meat salvage requirement on those bears.

1233
01:14:25.450 --> 01:14:28.120
Am I going to now condemn that hunting away?
No.

1234
01:14:28.270 --> 01:14:32.290
Well you wouldn't because you understand it and you know about it and you

1235
01:14:32.291 --> 01:14:34.450
understand the importance of it.
But to the average person,

1236
01:14:34.900 --> 01:14:39.160
the average person has a very cursory knowledge,
like very,

1237
01:14:39.580 --> 01:14:43.090
very peripheral.
When it comes to wildlife management,

1238
01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:44.020
they don't even consider it.

1239
01:14:44.530 --> 01:14:48.280
They think of trophy hunting is just being some evil person wants to kill things

1240
01:14:48.580 --> 01:14:50.910
again to make their dick hard.
Right.
That's like what?

1241
01:14:50.920 --> 01:14:54.400
Isn't that what Jimmy Kimmel said on TV when he started crying and we started

1242
01:14:54.401 --> 01:14:58.070
talking about Cecil?
No crying.
No,
I heard about the cried and he,

1243
01:14:58.240 --> 01:15:00.670
he did the whole cliche we talked about,

1244
01:15:00.671 --> 01:15:04.690
is that what you need to get your gift card?
I like that guy too.
Well,
I do too.

1245
01:15:04.750 --> 01:15:07.300
I like them a lot,
but I just don't think he understands.

1246
01:15:07.330 --> 01:15:08.230
I don't think he understands.

1247
01:15:08.231 --> 01:15:11.050
I don't think he educates himself about it and I think he worked 16 hours a day

1248
01:15:11.051 --> 01:15:15.730
on a show and I think he has very little knowledge about what it takes to manage

1249
01:15:15.731 --> 01:15:16.564
wildlife.

1250
01:15:16.690 --> 01:15:19.810
Now this is coming from someone who doesn't agree with the lion hunting,

1251
01:15:20.110 --> 01:15:24.760
that guy like I don't think the lion populations are low.
I mean,
or high rather.

1252
01:15:24.780 --> 01:15:26.890
I mean I don't think it's anything where you have to manage.

1253
01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:29.770
I mean I don't think that's the,
the issue that they're having in Zimbabwe.

1254
01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:31.630
I think this is just a,
it's a,

1255
01:15:31.900 --> 01:15:35.380
a way that they make money and there you can look at it that way.

1256
01:15:35.381 --> 01:15:39.740
Like it's sustainable and if it is sustainable and these people use it too to

1257
01:15:39.760 --> 01:15:42.880
make money and they benefit from the resource of people coming over there and

1258
01:15:42.881 --> 01:15:46.120
hunting them,
I guess you could see a positive benefit of it.
You know?

1259
01:15:46.390 --> 01:15:50.230
Did you ever see the Louis Theroux documentary on those hunting camps,

1260
01:15:50.231 --> 01:15:53.800
the high fence hunting camps in South Africa?
No,
it's pretty good.

1261
01:15:54.180 --> 01:15:57.290
It's [inaudible].
You told me about it and I really nailed to ever watch it.

1262
01:15:57.310 --> 01:16:00.040
Now I'm going to Redo it instead of rewriting it down in my notes.

1263
01:16:00.160 --> 01:16:02.950
It's excellent,
but one of the notepad,
I'm going to write it on my note.

1264
01:16:02.990 --> 01:16:07.540
All right.
One of the craziest parts of it was the lions.

1265
01:16:07.900 --> 01:16:12.900
They had this fenced in area and it's a small area where they have these lions

1266
01:16:13.690 --> 01:16:17.590
and they're throwing these cows literally over the fence there in the back of a

1267
01:16:17.591 --> 01:16:21.720
truck and they have this high fence and these lions are staring at them.

1268
01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:26.110
Fucking ruthless killer eyes.
I mean they are right there.

1269
01:16:26.111 --> 01:16:27.530
There's two sets of fences and K,

1270
01:16:27.531 --> 01:16:30.700
you know there's like a in case one of them fails because of the fence behind it

1271
01:16:30.701 --> 01:16:34.300
and they chuck these lions,
this cow,
this calf,

1272
01:16:34.301 --> 01:16:38.410
they throw it over the top like fucking Jurassic Park and they just tear this

1273
01:16:38.411 --> 01:16:41.500
thing apart and they looking at and will eventually while some guy goes and acts

1274
01:16:41.501 --> 01:16:44.230
like he's hunting the lions.
Exactly.
They're going to let one of those loose.

1275
01:16:44.920 --> 01:16:48.010
They let them out of the cage and lions are used to their territory.
Right?

1276
01:16:48.130 --> 01:16:49.240
So when they let him out of the cage,

1277
01:16:49.241 --> 01:16:51.220
the lions are going to get out of that cage and they're going to go,

1278
01:16:51.221 --> 01:16:52.054
where the fuck am I?

1279
01:16:52.150 --> 01:16:55.420
I'm just going to sit down here and try to figure out where the hell they are.

1280
01:16:55.540 --> 01:16:56.110
Right.

1281
01:16:56.110 --> 01:16:59.140
So they're going to sit down and then they send this hunter out in the hunter,

1282
01:16:59.141 --> 01:17:03.070
finds the line,
shoots it poses,
does the whole a picture with it.

1283
01:17:03.130 --> 01:17:07.450
And you know that guy pig man did that.
They had a whole episode and he's,

1284
01:17:07.480 --> 01:17:11.510
he's going and you can tell these lions have just been released.
He doesn't.

1285
01:17:11.511 --> 01:17:15.980
Does he show what he was doing that was not
high fence?

1286
01:17:16.330 --> 01:17:20.290
<v 2>This thing I don't understand about guys like Todd high fence.
Why do they,</v>

1287
01:17:21.490 --> 01:17:26.470
why do they love the trappings of hunting?

1288
01:17:27.010 --> 01:17:31.150
The appearance of hunting,
the methods of hunting,
the tools of hunting,

1289
01:17:31.151 --> 01:17:34.750
the close of hunting,
the photographs that come from hunting.

1290
01:17:35.290 --> 01:17:37.570
Why do they like that so much?

1291
01:17:38.050 --> 01:17:42.970
But they just don't like hunting the doing of.

1292
01:17:43.520 --> 01:17:47.540
<v 3>Is that what it is or whether they want guaranteed success and do they want to</v>

1293
01:17:47.541 --> 01:17:51.050
hide the fact that it's in a high fence environment because they're doing it on

1294
01:17:51.051 --> 01:17:55.220
television and don't things like the outdoor channel,
don't they have rules?

1295
01:17:55.340 --> 01:17:57.800
We have rules like you can't show high fences,

1296
01:17:57.801 --> 01:18:01.290
you can't show fences on television whether or not you could show,

1297
01:18:01.310 --> 01:18:02.143
do you feel like

1298
01:18:02.250 --> 01:18:02.860
<v 2>show it.</v>

1299
01:18:02.860 --> 01:18:07.860
But I feel like people are often doing non fair chase hunts but masquerading,

1300
01:18:10.771 --> 01:18:11.604
yes.

1301
01:18:11.850 --> 01:18:16.850
Did it was a fair chase hunt if you like to do [inaudible] aren't fair chase if

1302
01:18:17.971 --> 01:18:19.350
you like doing it,
why do you,

1303
01:18:19.351 --> 01:18:21.960
why do they have such a hard time just saying that's what I'd like to do.

1304
01:18:22.410 --> 01:18:27.410
Well I spent an enormous amount of time explaining why I like to do what I do.

1305
01:18:31.560 --> 01:18:33.540
You know,
why don't,

1306
01:18:33.570 --> 01:18:36.720
I would love for one of them to explain to me what they like about it instead of

1307
01:18:36.810 --> 01:18:39.450
doing it and acting like they did something different.
Well,

1308
01:18:40.050 --> 01:18:42.720
<v 3>per part of it is the network themselves,
right?</v>

1309
01:18:42.750 --> 01:18:44.760
The outdoor channel and the sportsmans channel,

1310
01:18:44.761 --> 01:18:47.310
they don't allow you to show high fences.

1311
01:18:47.700 --> 01:18:49.040
<v 2>That's part of their bio lines.
Right.</v>

1312
01:18:49.041 --> 01:18:52.290
I don't know if they say don't show high fences,
they might not want,

1313
01:18:52.830 --> 01:18:55.980
this is coming from Ben.
Brian.
Yeah.
So they might,
they might,

1314
01:18:56.660 --> 01:18:59.910
I can't say if they say don't show it or if they're saying don't do it.

1315
01:19:00.410 --> 01:19:03.890
<v 3>I think they say don't show it.
Don't show it.
Don't show it.
Because I can't.</v>

1316
01:19:03.891 --> 01:19:07.240
Nugent is on that program.
Right.
He's on those networks.
Right.

1317
01:19:07.370 --> 01:19:10.520
He's got a huge show on that network.
He hunts in his fucking yard.

1318
01:19:10.760 --> 01:19:12.740
I mean he's not,
he's not on a big piece of property.

1319
01:19:12.741 --> 01:19:16.850
I think he's less than 300 acres or maybe 300 acres.
That's not that much.

1320
01:19:17.180 --> 01:19:20.710
And in that 300 acres,
it's all high fence.
He's got African animals,

1321
01:19:20.740 --> 01:19:24.770
got all kinds of shit and they're white tails.
Pig's all in this one area.

1322
01:19:25.220 --> 01:19:30.020
And he hunts high fence almost exclusively.
And when he's hunting on it,
you know,

1323
01:19:30.021 --> 01:19:33.410
it says like spirit wild ranch.
That's his yard.

1324
01:19:33.920 --> 01:19:37.460
I mean he's essentially hunting has pets if you really want to look at it that

1325
01:19:37.461 --> 01:19:39.650
way.
And then he used his house goes,
sits in his favorite tree.

1326
01:19:39.651 --> 01:19:42.230
Stan probably got a bunch of them all over his property,

1327
01:19:42.290 --> 01:19:45.050
<v 2>but I don't,
I don't think he's proud of,
I think in and of itself,</v>

1328
01:19:45.140 --> 01:19:48.200
I don't feel there's anything wrong with that because my brother raises sheep.

1329
01:19:48.260 --> 01:19:52.430
Right.
And when he goes out to get the sheep,

1330
01:19:53.480 --> 01:19:58.370
he goes out with a 22 he's got irrigated pasture,
he runs lambs.

1331
01:19:58.400 --> 01:19:59.660
When he goes out to get a lamb,

1332
01:20:00.140 --> 01:20:02.090
he gives a lot of it way eat some of it for herself.

1333
01:20:02.160 --> 01:20:04.760
She was the land with the 22 however,

1334
01:20:05.540 --> 01:20:10.540
he doesn't dress it up like he's hunting the lambs out on his pasture.

1335
01:20:10.590 --> 01:20:13.450
Like it's a wild animal is going to sneak up on.
No,
I mean he does.

1336
01:20:13.530 --> 01:20:14.530
He doesn't like put,

1337
01:20:14.790 --> 01:20:18.490
he doesn't like put a picture of him in his 22 on in a dead lamb on face,

1338
01:20:18.491 --> 01:20:21.690
but he's like heart.
You know what I mean?
He's a hunter.

1339
01:20:21.900 --> 01:20:24.870
He's a very avid hunter and never once in his life.

1340
01:20:25.530 --> 01:20:27.960
I wish she was here because I'd like to ask them this question.

1341
01:20:28.200 --> 01:20:29.220
Never once in his life.

1342
01:20:29.221 --> 01:20:33.630
Has He confused the act of farming

1343
01:20:35.250 --> 01:20:39.570
organic sheet with the act of hunting wild elk?

1344
01:20:39.930 --> 01:20:43.110
It's not confusing to him.
No.
But is it confusing?

1345
01:20:43.200 --> 01:20:45.510
Like which house did you have a good hunting year?

1346
01:20:45.570 --> 01:20:47.880
He'd be like so far he got an elk.

1347
01:20:48.540 --> 01:20:52.730
What does Bo on national forest land,
he got an antelope with his bow

1348
01:20:54.510 --> 01:20:55.770
and he would never be like,
oh,

1349
01:20:56.310 --> 01:20:59.760
and I got 10 lamb in my yard.

1350
01:21:00.990 --> 01:21:03.030
Yeah.
It's just like,
I already did it.

1351
01:21:03.060 --> 01:21:07.740
It's just so weird to me that I feel like we talked about this,

1352
01:21:07.741 --> 01:21:11.250
a dog during to Doug during has to go out now and then and kill cattle on his

1353
01:21:11.251 --> 01:21:12.084
farm.

1354
01:21:12.720 --> 01:21:17.720
He doesn't like get gussied up and Cam oh and get like a bunch of pink accents

1355
01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.770
and like put pink accents all over his gun and go out

1356
01:21:24.650 --> 01:21:28.050
and go out and like shoot the cows on his property.
Right.
It'd be like,
no,

1357
01:21:28.051 --> 01:21:29.670
I wouldn't shut my cow.
Right.

1358
01:21:30.510 --> 01:21:33.900
He wouldn't make a TV show where he's like acting like he's hunting is cows,

1359
01:21:33.920 --> 01:21:37.680
but his fence is only,
you know,
20 yards.

1360
01:21:37.770 --> 01:21:42.330
Whereas Ted Nugent's fences,
300 acres.
Yeah.

1361
01:21:42.331 --> 01:21:45.510
I can't really speak to it cause I just,
I'd have to go see it.
Right.

1362
01:21:45.840 --> 01:21:49.200
Well I haven't seen it.
You know,
you only see it on the show.
You see him,

1363
01:21:49.201 --> 01:21:52.430
he takes around one of those little ATV vehicles,
you know,

1364
01:21:52.431 --> 01:21:54.510
the little things Brant and drives around and is,

1365
01:21:54.900 --> 01:21:58.620
it's beautiful piece of property.
It's kind of a cool way to acquire your meat.

1366
01:21:58.920 --> 01:22:02.520
You know,
if you have all these animal,
you 100% guaranteed.
There's animals there.

1367
01:22:02.540 --> 01:22:06.150
Yeah.
You know,
it's not like there's a big search,
you know,
you're like,
fuck yeah,

1368
01:22:06.290 --> 01:22:08.850
let's,
uh,
let's keep hiking.
You know?
But it's so weird.

1369
01:22:08.850 --> 01:22:13.850
Cause if my brother all sudden told me the one who raises sheep and Alex like I

1370
01:22:14.071 --> 01:22:16.710
keep,
I'm gonna explain the sheet thing a little bit better.

1371
01:22:16.740 --> 01:22:21.030
This might be interesting to your viewers,
your listeners.
He has pack llamas.

1372
01:22:21.240 --> 01:22:25.950
Okay.
He uses llamas.
He liked hunts back country for elk,
right.
Very,

1373
01:22:26.110 --> 01:22:28.470
very remote areas.
And Elk are big and he hunts by himself.

1374
01:22:29.250 --> 01:22:34.250
So he keeps llamas to carry his elk meat.

1375
01:22:35.550 --> 01:22:39.660
So he'll go in the mountains with his bow and he'd go in there for a long time

1376
01:22:39.661 --> 01:22:41.760
sometimes and when he kills an elk,

1377
01:22:42.060 --> 01:22:47.060
he can put the whole bowl on three llamas and pack the l out of the mountains.

1378
01:22:48.091 --> 01:22:51.870
He hunts some areas where he's nine miles from a trail head and he did that

1379
01:22:51.871 --> 01:22:54.960
because he fucked his backup,
carrying it out himself,
take care of you,
help me.

1380
01:22:55.260 --> 01:22:58.650
That's when he first got motivated by llamas.
Now cause he has llamas,

1381
01:22:58.680 --> 01:23:02.490
he bought irrigated pasture to keep the alarms on its flood irrigated,

1382
01:23:02.970 --> 01:23:03.960
but he's gone a lot,

1383
01:23:04.590 --> 01:23:08.440
so incentivize his bodies to come over and check on his lamas,

1384
01:23:08.441 --> 01:23:09.490
make sure everything's cool.

1385
01:23:09.491 --> 01:23:14.060
He lets them run sheep with the lamb and so they come over to watch,

1386
01:23:14.061 --> 01:23:18.310
to check on their sheep,
thereby checking on his llamas.

1387
01:23:19.810 --> 01:23:23.230
Now,
if he told me one day,
if all of a sudden he said,
hey man,

1388
01:23:23.950 --> 01:23:28.950
let's get all done up in our camel and I'm going to put a blind out,

1389
01:23:32.050 --> 01:23:36.640
I'm going to put a blind out what the sheet and let's sit in there and shoot

1390
01:23:36.700 --> 01:23:41.660
arrows at the sheep.
Right?
I would just think it was weird.

1391
01:23:41.780 --> 01:23:46.070
Yeah.
It's not like,
it's not like the,
I think it was like moral stuff,
right?

1392
01:23:46.460 --> 01:23:50.420
We have things in our lives that are just like moral obligations.

1393
01:23:50.421 --> 01:23:53.270
I feel like you have like a moral obligation to take care of her children.

1394
01:23:53.300 --> 01:23:56.390
I think if you're not taking care of your children,
I think you're like,

1395
01:23:57.470 --> 01:23:59.120
that's an immoral move

1396
01:24:00.710 --> 01:24:04.580
for my brother to go out and like decide that he wanted to shoot his bow at the

1397
01:24:04.581 --> 01:24:08.480
sheep on in his pasture would just strike me as just strange.

1398
01:24:09.770 --> 01:24:14.030
Yeah.
It's definitely strange.
But is it strange to stock upon with fish?

1399
01:24:16.090 --> 01:24:17.950
You have a small pond?
No,
in fact,

1400
01:24:18.010 --> 01:24:22.360
in fact his neighbor just dug a big fish pond.
Right.

1401
01:24:22.361 --> 01:24:27.310
But isn't that the hierarchy?
Oh,
the hierarchy of animals.
Yeah.

1402
01:24:27.610 --> 01:24:30.610
Yeah,
yeah.
It's just,
it's,
I can't explain it.

1403
01:24:30.760 --> 01:24:33.160
You won't type post something to me that still troubles me.

1404
01:24:33.161 --> 01:24:37.180
Now we're talking about Batan.
When I was a kid,
we baited dear.

1405
01:24:37.450 --> 01:24:40.180
I now realize that we had done a hell of a lot better deer hunting had we not

1406
01:24:40.181 --> 01:24:43.060
gotten involved in that.
But I was just how when I was a kid,

1407
01:24:43.750 --> 01:24:45.850
we'd go to this town,
grant Michigan,

1408
01:24:45.910 --> 01:24:48.610
they raised a lot of carrots and grant Michigan and you could buy,

1409
01:24:48.850 --> 01:24:52.540
they'd size the carrots and sort the carrots and you could fill the back of a

1410
01:24:52.541 --> 01:24:54.100
pickup truck.
It seems outlandish now.

1411
01:24:54.260 --> 01:24:59.260
I'm 40 years old and this was when I was 12 you could fill,

1412
01:24:59.650 --> 01:25:04.650
they would fill your truck with carrots for $5 I mean the bed of a pickup.

1413
01:25:05.110 --> 01:25:09.910
That's amazing.
Yeah.
The bed of a pickup would be full of carrots for five bucks.

1414
01:25:10.260 --> 01:25:13.990
How the fuck did carrot farmers make any money?
I and I never understood it.

1415
01:25:14.020 --> 01:25:16.600
There was a time when they were harvest and he'd go down there and they would

1416
01:25:16.601 --> 01:25:19.900
just,
you'd pull up on your grain hopper type thing and to fill your truck with

1417
01:25:19.901 --> 01:25:22.240
carrots.
Oh.
Sudden I want to care it.
We'd sit in the back.
Dude.

1418
01:25:22.570 --> 01:25:25.050
We'd sit in the back eating carrots,
man.
You'd find care.

1419
01:25:25.051 --> 01:25:29.560
It's like all the look like you could find care that look like humans.

1420
01:25:30.250 --> 01:25:33.850
You can find curious.
The Genitalia.
I mean just parents are crazy.
I'm like,

1421
01:25:33.851 --> 01:25:36.490
I have carrots,
my garden,
and you pull it,
the carrots,
your eyes,

1422
01:25:36.550 --> 01:25:39.040
you expect you're going to pull up the thing that looks like a care from the

1423
01:25:39.041 --> 01:25:41.200
store.
One in 10 yeah,

1424
01:25:41.440 --> 01:25:44.350
one in 10 most of them are like three legged carrots,

1425
01:25:44.380 --> 01:25:47.740
so they had it down a little better than I do and they had better care.

1426
01:25:47.740 --> 01:25:49.290
It's been,
we get always rejected carrots.

1427
01:25:49.300 --> 01:25:54.300
We'd have a snow shovel and we would go out to areas behind it and we would put

1428
01:25:54.371 --> 01:25:58.300
down a canvas tarp.
I can picture the tire right now.

1429
01:25:58.360 --> 01:26:03.360
We'd lay down a canvas tarp and you'd snow shovel carrots out of the back of the

1430
01:26:03.681 --> 01:26:07.970
truck onto the tarp or into what's known as the Duluth pack,

1431
01:26:08.270 --> 01:26:12.860
big canvas leather strap backpack,
and we would hike,

1432
01:26:13.610 --> 01:26:15.980
either drag the carrots on a tarp if possible,

1433
01:26:16.100 --> 01:26:20.480
or loading and backpacks and hike them back into the intersections of deer

1434
01:26:20.481 --> 01:26:24.170
trails.
Typically we're too big deal trails that come together and you dumped the

1435
01:26:24.171 --> 01:26:29.171
carrots out and then you do this a week before season and then you punt.

1436
01:26:29.900 --> 01:26:32.720
You'd sit in the tree,
stand with your bow,
you're picking the area,

1437
01:26:33.110 --> 01:26:36.700
the deer frequent anyways,
you're picking like,
uh,
like I said,

1438
01:26:36.740 --> 01:26:40.910
usually typically like a confluence of a couple good deer trails or pit area

1439
01:26:40.911 --> 01:26:45.911
where deer might stage up in the evening before going out into ag fields to

1440
01:26:46.131 --> 01:26:47.420
feed.
You know,

1441
01:26:47.421 --> 01:26:50.330
they kind of will mill around a little bit oftentimes before committing to a

1442
01:26:50.331 --> 01:26:54.720
field at nighttime.
It's set him up in these areas.
Um,

1443
01:26:55.070 --> 01:26:57.590
the problem is as soon as you put down the carrots,

1444
01:26:57.591 --> 01:27:02.330
you'd be creating problems for yourself because they would start to associate

1445
01:27:03.230 --> 01:27:05.810
the carrots with hunters.

1446
01:27:05.870 --> 01:27:10.160
Like they knew trouble's brewing your smells around,
you got deer.
You know,

1447
01:27:10.170 --> 01:27:14.060
doe can be,
I mean,
they can get really old,
but let's just be realistic.

1448
01:27:14.061 --> 01:27:17.420
And you got all kinds of deer doles around that are five,
six,
seven years old.

1449
01:27:17.421 --> 01:27:19.700
You accumulate a lot,
a lot of knowledge in that time.

1450
01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.070
So you put the carrots down,
you're kind of screwing yourself,

1451
01:27:22.520 --> 01:27:24.030
but you would get shots,

1452
01:27:24.090 --> 01:27:28.910
young deer that would come in to hit the carrots.

1453
01:27:29.570 --> 01:27:34.460
So I grew up hunting bait.
Now I look at it and be like,
man,

1454
01:27:35.720 --> 01:27:39.710
I would have learned a hell of a lot more about deer and a lot more about deer

1455
01:27:39.711 --> 01:27:42.500
hunting early on if I hadn't gotten,

1456
01:27:42.560 --> 01:27:46.240
if I hadn't been involved in that practice,
I now look back.
I'm like,
man,

1457
01:27:46.241 --> 01:27:50.360
did I miss a lot of chances to get educated about what do you need and how to

1458
01:27:50.361 --> 01:27:53.690
actually find deer instead of trying to manipulate their movement patterns,

1459
01:27:54.230 --> 01:27:57.920
you know,
so now I don't hunt.
I don't hunt bait anymore.

1460
01:27:58.070 --> 01:28:01.880
I'm not even kind of interested in hunting bay and I was explaining this to you.

1461
01:28:02.570 --> 01:28:05.690
This is a long ass story.
I was explaining this to you because you were like,

1462
01:28:05.691 --> 01:28:10.550
well,
why is it okay to use bait when you're fishing?
Yeah.
I don't know.

1463
01:28:13.070 --> 01:28:16.640
<v 4>It is a way I wish I could explain it.</v>

1464
01:28:17.630 --> 01:28:21.500
I don't know.
It's more sporting in my mind to use.

1465
01:28:22.010 --> 01:28:23.780
I hate that word.
No,
I don't hate that word.

1466
01:28:24.050 --> 01:28:28.670
It's more sporting in my mind to catch a fish with bait than it is to catch them

1467
01:28:28.671 --> 01:28:32.540
in a sane,
each sane.
Don't you hate that argument though,

1468
01:28:32.541 --> 01:28:34.400
that people say you're a real man.

1469
01:28:34.520 --> 01:28:37.940
Why don't you go fuck and fight that animal one on one?

1470
01:28:38.090 --> 01:28:42.860
Once you what you were with a sniper rifle sitting around with a rifle,

1471
01:28:42.920 --> 01:28:46.460
shoot silly.
Why don't you go hit it with a rock?
Praise your bare hands.

1472
01:28:46.490 --> 01:28:48.260
Crazy horse had a rifle.
Did he?

1473
01:28:48.690 --> 01:28:52.940
Well he's an Indian or saying like forgiveness or whatever people have.

1474
01:28:53.510 --> 01:28:56.390
Yeah,
I'm just saying like if someone was posing that argument to me,

1475
01:28:56.391 --> 01:29:01.391
I would point out how people that hunt for their food have

1476
01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:05.490
<v 2>always gravitated toward technology.</v>

1477
01:29:05.970 --> 01:29:10.970
And if you look at our progression from rocks to have to do rocks to add

1478
01:29:12.520 --> 01:29:17.100
laterals to Bo equipment,
to Flint,

1479
01:29:17.101 --> 01:29:20.130
locks to percussion,
cap to paper,

1480
01:29:20.131 --> 01:29:23.820
cartridge to rifling on down the line.

1481
01:29:23.880 --> 01:29:28.880
I'm not doing anything that revolutionary by using what an effective means.

1482
01:29:30.300 --> 01:29:35.130
New Ideas.
It's abating.
It's a new idea.
Yeah,

1483
01:29:35.131 --> 01:29:37.950
but it's not interesting to me.
Right.
I'm talking about interests.

1484
01:29:37.970 --> 01:29:42.960
Like I like knowing about animals,
right?
I'm not interested in there.

1485
01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:46.110
Let's take the area right there.
I want bears.
I want bears in the coastal area.

1486
01:29:46.380 --> 01:29:49.530
Okay.
And is that a northern latitude?

1487
01:29:50.400 --> 01:29:52.620
There's a lot of snow there,

1488
01:29:52.710 --> 01:29:55.770
but because of maritime influences,

1489
01:29:56.110 --> 01:29:59.910
you know it's warm enough down around the water where it snows melted off in the

1490
01:29:59.911 --> 01:30:01.800
water.
So when I go to hunt bears and the spring,

1491
01:30:02.610 --> 01:30:07.610
90% of the landmass is covered in snow and is of little use to a bear.

1492
01:30:10.530 --> 01:30:13.050
Okay.
When they come out of hibernation,

1493
01:30:13.290 --> 01:30:17.400
they're going down to the waterfront cause on the waterfront they're gonna find

1494
01:30:17.520 --> 01:30:20.370
beach ry and some other grasses they like to eat.

1495
01:30:20.700 --> 01:30:25.230
They're going to find blue mussels and they liked the crabs under rocks and

1496
01:30:25.231 --> 01:30:26.730
logs.
Now.

1497
01:30:26.760 --> 01:30:31.760
So I know about Mussel beds and grass flats were bears are going to go to all

1498
01:30:32.161 --> 01:30:36.990
the time.
I can tell you when we go out at night,
I can tell you,

1499
01:30:36.991 --> 01:30:40.290
I'll be like,
we'll see more than one,
probably less than five.

1500
01:30:41.010 --> 01:30:44.250
And I'll tell you and I know and I know some Mussel beds where some are going to

1501
01:30:44.251 --> 01:30:49.230
show up.
I like that.
I don't like,

1502
01:30:49.680 --> 01:30:52.800
I've never done it baited bear hunt.
I have no desire to do a Beta bear hunt.

1503
01:30:53.220 --> 01:30:53.640
Is it?

1504
01:30:53.640 --> 01:30:58.590
Does that mean it's super hard to hunt bears where I hunt bears?

1505
01:30:58.620 --> 01:30:59.520
I can't tell you that.

1506
01:30:59.521 --> 01:31:04.521
It's super hard to hunt bears there because once you learn the rhythms of the

1507
01:31:05.461 --> 01:31:09.840
land,
what they want,
why they're coming there,

1508
01:31:09.870 --> 01:31:13.140
what they're coming to get,
it becomes easier and easier.

1509
01:31:13.141 --> 01:31:14.850
The more you understand bears in,

1510
01:31:14.851 --> 01:31:17.160
the more you understand why bears do what they do,

1511
01:31:17.580 --> 01:31:21.720
but I like having that knowledge,
but I can't say it's like super hard.

1512
01:31:21.721 --> 01:31:24.810
It's not super hard.
Once you know it,
it's pretty easy.

1513
01:31:24.990 --> 01:31:29.010
So when I say I don't want to go hunt bears over bait,
personally,

1514
01:31:30.030 --> 01:31:31.770
I'm not saying,
oh,
because it's so easy.

1515
01:31:31.800 --> 01:31:34.080
I'm just saying because it's just not of interest to me.

1516
01:31:34.110 --> 01:31:38.940
It's like it's not interesting to me personally as a hunter that bears will come

1517
01:31:38.941 --> 01:31:40.440
to donuts if you put them out in the woods.

1518
01:31:41.790 --> 01:31:44.790
It's not an interesting phenomenon.

1519
01:31:45.330 --> 01:31:48.060
What's interesting me is they like muscle beds.
Like for whatever reason,

1520
01:31:48.061 --> 01:31:50.460
I find that interesting.
When I lived in Michigan,
my brothers,

1521
01:31:50.760 --> 01:31:53.070
each drew a black bear tag,
a Michigan,

1522
01:31:53.190 --> 01:31:54.930
you could live your whole life in Michigan,

1523
01:31:54.960 --> 01:31:58.560
which has a lot of barriers in the north and never lay eyes on a bear because of

1524
01:31:58.561 --> 01:32:02.590
the landscapes flat and it stick.
If you want a Honda bear there,

1525
01:32:03.500 --> 01:32:04.000
<v 0>yeah,</v>

1526
01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.100
<v 2>you're going to either have to use dogs,</v>

1527
01:32:06.380 --> 01:32:10.060
you're going to have to use bait because that's the way the landscape is.

1528
01:32:10.150 --> 01:32:13.720
So when they drew bear tags,
I helped them run Bates,
I helped them collect bait.

1529
01:32:13.721 --> 01:32:18.370
We shot carp and all kinds of stuff and froze bait and trap beavers and baited

1530
01:32:18.371 --> 01:32:22.540
bears form.
It was the only way to do it.
I had a blast doing it.
But right now,
no,

1531
01:32:22.560 --> 01:32:23.410
it's just not interest

1532
01:32:23.530 --> 01:32:28.510
<v 3>me.
Well,
in Alberta they have two places that they hunt bears,</v>

1533
01:32:28.511 --> 01:32:31.000
they hunt bears over bait in the spring.

1534
01:32:31.120 --> 01:32:34.090
And then in the fall they'd go to these,
uh,

1535
01:32:34.120 --> 01:32:39.070
open fields where they find blueberries and the open fields,

1536
01:32:39.460 --> 01:32:42.520
his rifle hunting most of the time.
And then in the Bates,

1537
01:32:42.550 --> 01:32:44.140
they most of the time use archer.

1538
01:32:44.390 --> 01:32:48.260
<v 2>Yeah.
And you can bring them in close and,
and figure out what size they are.</v>

1539
01:32:48.290 --> 01:32:51.650
Exactly.
Not Kill or not kill solves with cubs.
I understand that.
Yeah.

1540
01:32:51.840 --> 01:32:54.000
<v 3>No,
but I understand what you're saying too.</v>

1541
01:32:54.030 --> 01:32:57.960
It makes total sense because what you're doing is you're going to places where

1542
01:32:57.961 --> 01:33:01.050
they would be no matter what without human influence whatsoever.

1543
01:33:01.051 --> 01:33:03.930
They would be there for those muscles.
They'd be there for those grasses.

1544
01:33:04.200 --> 01:33:05.220
And so you are,

1545
01:33:05.310 --> 01:33:10.310
you are experiencing the actual natural progression of them waking up from their

1546
01:33:11.731 --> 01:33:14.340
hibernation and heading down to feed.

1547
01:33:14.400 --> 01:33:18.480
You're just going where you know they will be and it's not,
there's no donuts,

1548
01:33:18.510 --> 01:33:20.550
there's no cookies,
there's no bullshit,

1549
01:33:20.580 --> 01:33:24.630
no fucking big blue jugs that are set out for them to pour it and try and get

1550
01:33:24.631 --> 01:33:29.520
their boats out of.
Yeah.
There's something less cool about that.
Like uh,

1551
01:33:29.670 --> 01:33:30.330
like,

1552
01:33:30.330 --> 01:33:35.330
like elk hunting on elk hunting in Colorado or overhear and to hone ranch when

1553
01:33:35.881 --> 01:33:36.810
you're,
you're out there,

1554
01:33:36.811 --> 01:33:39.960
those animals would be there whether you exist it or not,

1555
01:33:40.270 --> 01:33:41.940
they're out doing l type stuff.
They're,

1556
01:33:41.941 --> 01:33:45.930
they're out breeding and eating and you just,
you're just trying to find them,

1557
01:33:45.931 --> 01:33:48.750
locate them,
and then put a stalk on one and get one.

1558
01:33:49.230 --> 01:33:52.830
That's a pure way of doing it for sure.
But then there's people that would argue,

1559
01:33:52.860 --> 01:33:55.590
you know,
like the,
the argument of,
well,
you're using a rifle,

1560
01:33:55.591 --> 01:33:57.840
how hard could it be?
You know?
And then there's other,

1561
01:33:57.841 --> 01:33:59.700
although also people would say,
well,
you know,

1562
01:33:59.701 --> 01:34:02.100
I prefer to hunt with a bow because it's more difficult.

1563
01:34:02.310 --> 01:34:04.080
Like what you're talking about is more difficult.

1564
01:34:04.260 --> 01:34:07.440
But then there's also people that were saying,
well,
if you hunt with a bow,

1565
01:34:07.441 --> 01:34:10.560
you have more of a chance of wounding and animal and not killing it.
You should,

1566
01:34:10.561 --> 01:34:12.060
you should use a rifle.
I mean,

1567
01:34:12.061 --> 01:34:13.850
you're not going to make everybody happy no matter what.

1568
01:34:13.950 --> 01:34:14.311
<v 2>No.</v>

1569
01:34:14.311 --> 01:34:19.311
The difficult argument is it gets really circular and hard to pin down because

1570
01:34:21.930 --> 01:34:25.820
if you say,
you know,
I,
I don't,

1571
01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.700
I hunt with a compound bow.
I liked the cause.
It's more,

1572
01:34:28.850 --> 01:34:32.320
it's harder than hunting with a rifle.
Then you'd have to go,
okay.

1573
01:34:32.930 --> 01:34:35.600
Then by extension,
the recurve,
and if you're gonna do that,

1574
01:34:35.870 --> 01:34:40.430
you should hunt with a long bow.
And then if you're going to do that,

1575
01:34:40.460 --> 01:34:42.110
you should hunt with an adult ladol,

1576
01:34:42.140 --> 01:34:43.880
which is certainly more difficult than the long,

1577
01:34:44.540 --> 01:34:46.700
like the throwing board of the dart.

1578
01:34:46.760 --> 01:34:50.930
Oh Jesus predated the predated the bow.

1579
01:34:50.990 --> 01:34:53.300
The Bose only like here on this continent,
they,
you know,

1580
01:34:53.320 --> 01:34:55.370
the bowls only been around for people debate it,

1581
01:34:55.371 --> 01:34:58.700
but somewhere between four and 6,000.
So you had 10,000 years.

1582
01:34:58.701 --> 01:35:03.170
The human history are more here where they're hunting was addle addles I bet

1583
01:35:03.171 --> 01:35:05.630
there was skinny as fuck guys hunting woolly mammoths.

1584
01:35:05.631 --> 01:35:09.000
They weren't hunting willy mammals.
The bows.
Wow.
You're home with adult.

1585
01:35:09.170 --> 01:35:12.680
So that's that,
that thing where you put the spear on it and you know,

1586
01:35:12.681 --> 01:35:14.930
it's kind of like go cop in the exact,

1587
01:35:15.130 --> 01:35:17.900
put a couple fingers in there or some kind of holding board and you fling a

1588
01:35:17.901 --> 01:35:22.820
spear or those,
it makes your arm.
Yeah,
it's like a big ball.
It makes,

1589
01:35:22.821 --> 01:35:25.820
it's an extension of your arm and makes your arm essentially longer.

1590
01:35:25.970 --> 01:35:29.510
How would you go when you go to people to a dog park and they're hawking tennis

1591
01:35:29.511 --> 01:35:34.130
balls that little.
Yeah,
that same thing.
It's like an ad Aladel principle.
Right?

1592
01:35:34.520 --> 01:35:38.690
So yeah,
there was for you know,
10,000 years people hunted here with atlatls.

1593
01:35:38.840 --> 01:35:42.260
How accurate are those things that I've seen guys get good man.
Really?
Yeah,

1594
01:35:42.261 --> 01:35:43.071
I've seen guys get good.

1595
01:35:43.071 --> 01:35:47.720
How much distance can get it'll teen 20 yards tops tops.
Yeah.

1596
01:35:47.810 --> 01:35:49.880
I'm sure it's some guy was like,
oh,
did do it.
But yeah,

1597
01:35:49.940 --> 01:35:52.080
guys that kill stuff with allows kill stuff.
Adults,

1598
01:35:53.270 --> 01:35:56.110
the thing that's going on right now,
like people are doing that like that.

1599
01:35:56.200 --> 01:35:58.270
But the problem is there's,
that's why guys,

1600
01:35:58.271 --> 01:36:01.520
a hunt with Adelaide hills will tend to hunt wild pigs or other things like that

1601
01:36:01.521 --> 01:36:04.730
because most places you can't use them.
Oh,
okay.

1602
01:36:04.731 --> 01:36:07.550
So you could do it with wild pigs because they're considered a nuisance and some

1603
01:36:07.551 --> 01:36:11.820
areas,
yes,
you can use all their means to kill him,
but most states they don't.

1604
01:36:13.260 --> 01:36:17.580
All states have somewhere they spell out legal method of take.
It is,

1605
01:36:17.581 --> 01:36:22.230
we looked into this once.
I think that it,
like in Alaska,

1606
01:36:22.260 --> 01:36:24.660
I think for the most part,
like yeah,
you could hunt Caribou with an adult.

1607
01:36:24.661 --> 01:36:27.270
Adol I could be wrong,
don't know and go out and do it because of that.

1608
01:36:27.300 --> 01:36:29.370
Remember looking at the way it's worded,

1609
01:36:29.670 --> 01:36:31.920
and I think you could hunt Caribou with an adult model,

1610
01:36:32.130 --> 01:36:37.130
but state spell out legal method of take in exquisite detail.

1611
01:36:37.620 --> 01:36:42.480
For instance,
hunting waterfowl,
which is waterfalls,

1612
01:36:42.481 --> 01:36:45.660
federally regulated and state regulation,
because they're migratory,

1613
01:36:45.661 --> 01:36:46.770
they move across state lines.

1614
01:36:46.830 --> 01:36:50.040
So the feds step in to try to make sure the states aren't taking more than their

1615
01:36:50.041 --> 01:36:51.240
equal share of the resource.

1616
01:36:51.600 --> 01:36:56.600
Now they'll spell out the diameter or bore of the shotgun you're allowed to use.

1617
01:36:58.740 --> 01:37:02.310
You can't use an eight gauge,
you know,

1618
01:37:02.610 --> 01:37:04.200
and then they'll spell out you can't use,

1619
01:37:04.260 --> 01:37:08.520
you can't use anything bigger than a 10 and you can't use anything smaller than

1620
01:37:08.521 --> 01:37:09.480
or whatever,
you know,

1621
01:37:09.570 --> 01:37:13.110
for 10 or something less than that are not allowed to use it for 10 so they'll

1622
01:37:13.111 --> 01:37:16.560
spell on a squeeze it detail what you can and can't do for legal method to take.

1623
01:37:16.920 --> 01:37:20.610
So a lot of what I'm saying about if you want to go back,
back,
back,

1624
01:37:20.611 --> 01:37:24.300
back in time to have things get more and more and more difficult.

1625
01:37:25.320 --> 01:37:30.090
It's hypothetical because the guy that is doing as far as weapon choice,

1626
01:37:30.720 --> 01:37:35.040
the most difficult thing you can legally do for general big game hunting in the

1627
01:37:35.120 --> 01:37:39.260
US for a weapon choice would be that you'd hunt with a longbow cause you're

1628
01:37:39.261 --> 01:37:41.400
still legal.
It's still illegal method.

1629
01:37:41.430 --> 01:37:44.910
Take for most archery seasons to hunt with a longbow.
Um,

1630
01:37:45.090 --> 01:37:48.890
so if you want to cripple yourself or handicap,
I don't want to say crap,

1631
01:37:48.910 --> 01:37:51.240
you want to handicap yourself equipment wise.

1632
01:37:51.450 --> 01:37:55.380
The guy who uses a longbow is going way.
Now,

1633
01:37:55.381 --> 01:38:00.381
I recently looked at an ad where a guy is getting out of a helicopter

1634
01:38:04.710 --> 01:38:05.543
<v 0>in</v>

1635
01:38:06.320 --> 01:38:10.160
<v 2>space age,
dress with a longbow.</v>

1636
01:38:11.600 --> 01:38:14.840
So we all,
it's a hunting clothes ad.
Okay.

1637
01:38:15.350 --> 01:38:20.350
So we all find our little ways of mental masturbation and this isn't just

1638
01:38:20.571 --> 01:38:23.630
something to happen.
This is like an image that they thought his cooler.

1639
01:38:23.900 --> 01:38:26.180
Hell yeah.
Feel like it's so cool.

1640
01:38:26.240 --> 01:38:29.840
It will be the front of the catalog is climbing out of a helicopter with a

1641
01:38:29.870 --> 01:38:34.190
longbow.
So we occupy the [inaudible] and in the U s for the most part,

1642
01:38:34.191 --> 01:38:36.950
like in Alaska for instance,
you can't hunt with a helicopter.

1643
01:38:36.951 --> 01:38:38.930
You can't use a helicopter to supply a hunting camp.

1644
01:38:38.931 --> 01:38:40.850
You can't scout for animals from a helicopter.

1645
01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:46.000
We decided it's just not fair to use helicopters because you can land them

1646
01:38:47.011 --> 01:38:49.700
anywhere you want and you can't hunt for the most part.

1647
01:38:49.730 --> 01:38:53.000
You can't hunt and fly on the same day.
Just not fair.

1648
01:38:53.300 --> 01:38:56.300
But here's like a longbow and a chopper.

1649
01:38:58.730 --> 01:39:01.970
So we all come up with our ways of,
of,

1650
01:39:02.750 --> 01:39:06.830
of finding comfort.
Yeah.
You know,

1651
01:39:06.831 --> 01:39:11.510
our ways of finding that right.
Mix of challenge,
not challenge.

1652
01:39:11.511 --> 01:39:14.930
I heard a guy say,
people have really struggled to define fair chase.

1653
01:39:14.931 --> 01:39:17.660
And I heard someone recently,
I don't think it's a new thing,

1654
01:39:17.661 --> 01:39:21.260
but I heard it recently where he was saying that in fair chase,

1655
01:39:21.590 --> 01:39:26.590
the animal has a better than 50% chance of escape or something to that effect.

1656
01:39:27.290 --> 01:39:32.030
My brother's a statistician.
Um,

1657
01:39:32.090 --> 01:39:34.260
he's an ecologist but he does,
uh,
he,

1658
01:39:34.710 --> 01:39:39.290
he specialized in like statistical modeling and I asked him what he thought of a

1659
01:39:39.291 --> 01:39:44.291
statement like that and he couldn't even find the language to begin telling me

1660
01:39:44.421 --> 01:39:45.560
how stupid that was.

1661
01:39:46.670 --> 01:39:51.350
That it has a 50% chance to escape like under what requirements?
Right.
Or like,

1662
01:39:51.380 --> 01:39:55.940
like he like made his head like smoke come out of his ears when you heard that.

1663
01:39:56.180 --> 01:40:00.240
But what the guys trying to get at is this idea that you have an [inaudible]

1664
01:40:00.740 --> 01:40:04.630
that there's an unknown element,
right?

1665
01:40:04.970 --> 01:40:07.310
There's not guaranteed success is not guaranteed.

1666
01:40:07.580 --> 01:40:12.050
When my brother goes out to shoot his sheep,
it's a hundred nos.
Yeah.

1667
01:40:12.080 --> 01:40:15.710
Did it's time to shoot the sheet.
Right now,

1668
01:40:15.740 --> 01:40:20.740
this is the same guy that recently spent 21 days hunting elk would his bow on

1669
01:40:25.121 --> 01:40:29.310
national forest land before he finally got a bolt.
And he's very good elk.

1670
01:40:29.320 --> 01:40:33.140
He uses a recurve though,
right?
No,
with a compound bow.
Which brother?
Matt.

1671
01:40:33.300 --> 01:40:38.300
So does Danny uses recurve or did he shoot a recurve but it mainly haunts or the

1672
01:40:39.621 --> 01:40:40.100
rifle.

1673
01:40:40.100 --> 01:40:43.720
Did Matt decide at one point in time he was going to use only a recurrence?

1674
01:40:43.950 --> 01:40:45.920
The brother was the one that Danny,

1675
01:40:46.070 --> 01:40:48.470
Danny is more and more interested in hunting would is recurve.

1676
01:40:48.500 --> 01:40:51.890
He does Hellmann's recurred,
but he all,
I mean he just,
he,
he drew the same,

1677
01:40:51.891 --> 01:40:53.680
a copper river tag

1678
01:40:54.460 --> 01:40:57.850
<v 4>that I drew in 2004 and two days ago.
He got a buffalo up there and he shot,</v>

1679
01:40:57.851 --> 01:41:01.060
it was,
he got over his rise.
So did he go by himself for 21 days?

1680
01:41:01.560 --> 01:41:01.770
<v 5>Okay.</v>

1681
01:41:01.770 --> 01:41:03.710
<v 4>My brother man.
Yeah.
Wow.</v>

1682
01:41:04.090 --> 01:41:07.310
In the car and it was a couple of different trips added up to 21 days.

1683
01:41:07.320 --> 01:41:10.440
It was just trying to locate the right bowl or trying to locate any bull.

1684
01:41:10.470 --> 01:41:14.760
Just haunting and bowl.
Yeah.
But he yawns and a very,

1685
01:41:15.030 --> 01:41:17.800
he haunts in an area where there's about,
is that the herd?

1686
01:41:18.360 --> 01:41:20.970
When we started hunting that area,
this is in Yellowstone.

1687
01:41:20.971 --> 01:41:23.940
It's kind of funny now looking back at the return to this whole wolf thing,

1688
01:41:24.610 --> 01:41:27.010
it's like,
you know,
the greater Yellowstone ecosystem.
Okay.

1689
01:41:27.011 --> 01:41:29.640
The guy he law say that the,

1690
01:41:29.641 --> 01:41:32.110
the area surrounding Yellowstone and Wyoming and Montana,

1691
01:41:32.500 --> 01:41:36.970
we started hunting that area in 97 now it seems like dislike,
you know,

1692
01:41:36.971 --> 01:41:38.200
it was profanity,
right word.

1693
01:41:38.500 --> 01:41:40.750
Now I was like this watershed moment because right when wolves,

1694
01:41:40.780 --> 01:41:44.700
right that's right around the reintroduction of the wolf.
Um,

1695
01:41:45.150 --> 01:41:45.460
<v 5>okay.</v>

1696
01:41:45.460 --> 01:41:49.330
<v 4>There is now less than half as many elk in that area is aware of the time we</v>

1697
01:41:49.331 --> 01:41:50.164
started hunting it.

1698
01:41:50.680 --> 01:41:54.880
But he's way more than twice is good hunting them now.

1699
01:41:55.340 --> 01:41:55.550
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

1700
01:41:55.550 --> 01:42:00.140
<v 4>So how he's grown and developed as an El Conor,</v>

1701
01:42:00.260 --> 01:42:04.130
he has a higher success rate now hunting half as many elk cause we used to hunt.

1702
01:42:04.690 --> 01:42:04.980
<v 5>Okay.</v>

1703
01:42:04.980 --> 01:42:09.060
<v 4>That's fascinating.
So because knowledge.
Yeah,
cause he just learned it.</v>

1704
01:42:09.420 --> 01:42:11.670
He's one of the great,
he's one of the best hunters,

1705
01:42:12.480 --> 01:42:15.990
but I know and it's not because of any particular thing,

1706
01:42:15.991 --> 01:42:19.580
it's just the tenacity thing.
He's tenacious.
Well,

1707
01:42:19.880 --> 01:42:24.350
speaking of tenacity,
you,
that's one of your qualities as well.

1708
01:42:24.380 --> 01:42:27.740
And one of the things that I found fucking unbelievably ridiculous about your

1709
01:42:27.741 --> 01:42:31.940
show was when you made a decoy of a grouse.
Yeah.

1710
01:42:32.630 --> 01:42:35.280
And you tried to figure out whether or not you could you,
you,

1711
01:42:35.290 --> 01:42:37.280
you had someone make a reed,
I mean,

1712
01:42:37.281 --> 01:42:39.650
a grouse for people that don't know is a very small bird.

1713
01:42:39.710 --> 01:42:43.580
Blue rouse though blue graphs at big small bird will big like what is it,

1714
01:42:43.610 --> 01:42:44.443
half pound?

1715
01:42:44.710 --> 01:42:45.543
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

1716
01:42:45.590 --> 01:42:49.240
<v 4>Does it even know,
I mean,
doves almost a half pound.
No.</v>

1717
01:42:49.310 --> 01:42:53.240
How much does way a few pounds.
Oh,
it does if a few columns.
Okay,

1718
01:42:53.241 --> 01:42:57.790
so a football size,
how big is it?
Yeah,
the body.
But yeah,

1719
01:42:57.880 --> 01:43:01.220
that's a decent size.
Bigger in order to be,
if you plucked one out,

1720
01:43:01.250 --> 01:43:04.820
it'd be like a not fat Cornish Game Hen.
Okay.

1721
01:43:05.300 --> 01:43:08.150
So very small chicken.
I'll let you,
you,
have you seen my chickens?

1722
01:43:08.360 --> 01:43:12.560
I got some really some of,
um,
we,
we've got a couple really tiny chickens.
Yeah.

1723
01:43:12.570 --> 01:43:16.580
Tony were like us.
He knew he had a blue grouse is his seeming we bird.
Okay.

1724
01:43:16.581 --> 01:43:19.510
You know what,
that they're,
they're not as heavy as a pheasant,
let's say.
Okay.

1725
01:43:19.550 --> 01:43:20.830
They're not as heavy as a cock pheasant,

1726
01:43:21.140 --> 01:43:26.140
but meanwhile you spent fucking days trying to figure out how to more

1727
01:43:27.111 --> 01:43:29.750
effectively hunt.
It's one little thing.
Yeah.

1728
01:43:30.050 --> 01:43:33.230
I became obsessed with,

1729
01:43:35.010 --> 01:43:35.810
<v 5>yeah,</v>

1730
01:43:35.810 --> 01:43:39.290
<v 4>I use that word was such hesitation,
man.
I became of,
yeah,
it's like,</v>

1731
01:43:39.330 --> 01:43:44.090
it's a good word because we used to fully concentrate upon,

1732
01:43:44.150 --> 01:43:48.810
yeah,
so there's this bird,
um,
who called the blue grills?
No,

1733
01:43:49.670 --> 01:43:52.050
Blue Ross used to be used to know blue grouse

1734
01:43:52.050 --> 01:43:55.550
<v 2>is Dusky grouse and Sodi grouse and it's the,
it's um,</v>

1735
01:43:57.050 --> 01:44:00.970
then for a long time they lumped them together as blue grouse and then in,

1736
01:44:00.971 --> 01:44:05.900
in a decade ago or some time,
maybe 97 or sometime around there,

1737
01:44:06.710 --> 01:44:08.270
no,
no,
I'm sorry,
2007.

1738
01:44:08.390 --> 01:44:13.390
The ornithological society realize that there is a difference between the

1739
01:44:13.461 --> 01:44:14.300
different species,

1740
01:44:14.360 --> 01:44:18.020
the different types of blue grouse and they re split them or they suggested that

1741
01:44:18.021 --> 01:44:20.450
they'd be reread,
split into cities and duskys.

1742
01:44:21.920 --> 01:44:26.920
So you have Dusky grouse or in the interior mountain ranges and city graphs from

1743
01:44:27.201 --> 01:44:29.720
the to ranges.
And there is a normal bird,

1744
01:44:29.721 --> 01:44:33.320
people call them fools hands and they call them dumb birds and all this kind of

1745
01:44:33.321 --> 01:44:37.730
stuff because they don't,
when they think of the things that they're afraid of,

1746
01:44:38.420 --> 01:44:41.260
they're just not afraid of people.
They don't have much exposure to people.

1747
01:44:41.270 --> 01:44:44.840
They live in pay at places where most people don't go.
Um,

1748
01:44:45.110 --> 01:44:48.260
so when a Predator approaches,
when human approach,

1749
01:44:48.261 --> 01:44:50.030
what they typically want to do is jump into a tree.

1750
01:44:50.510 --> 01:44:55.510
They want to get off the ground so they can't get nabbed by a bobcat or a fox or

1751
01:44:56.871 --> 01:45:00.680
a coyote.
And they get under some limbs in a tree.
So the,

1752
01:45:00.681 --> 01:45:03.110
so the avian predators can't smack them.

1753
01:45:04.040 --> 01:45:06.920
And then people walk up and there's this bird sit in the tree and they shoot the

1754
01:45:06.921 --> 01:45:09.920
burner.
Like,
Oh that bird stupid.
When in fact the bird is not,

1755
01:45:10.460 --> 01:45:15.200
the bird has his way of surviving his typical threats and it has having adjusted

1756
01:45:15.500 --> 01:45:20.210
to human predation.
Cause there's just so little of it on them.
Um,

1757
01:45:20.990 --> 01:45:25.160
we used to hunt bears black bears in the spring on avalanche slides because when

1758
01:45:25.161 --> 01:45:26.420
the mountains are all snowing,

1759
01:45:26.780 --> 01:45:29.540
you get an avalanche slides that they're swept clean of snow.

1760
01:45:29.810 --> 01:45:33.230
And those areas are the first to green up because the snow slid off and it

1761
01:45:33.231 --> 01:45:35.810
doesn't need to melt off.
And so embarrassed come out of hibernation.

1762
01:45:35.811 --> 01:45:38.870
They'll come and find those avalanche chutes and feed out him.

1763
01:45:38.871 --> 01:45:43.871
And we used to sit just at the base of an avalanche slide all day waiting for

1764
01:45:44.720 --> 01:45:46.430
bears to come out and doing this now.

1765
01:45:46.431 --> 01:45:51.410
And then in the spring you'd hear this noise that would go who?
W?
W,
w.

1766
01:45:51.590 --> 01:45:55.610
W.
W.
And I can never forget the hell it was because I was brought up in Michigan

1767
01:45:55.611 --> 01:45:58.150
where there aren't these girls don't live.
Eventually realize that it's,

1768
01:45:58.360 --> 01:46:02.510
it's a blue grouse and that's their mating call in the spring.

1769
01:46:02.960 --> 01:46:06.200
Is that who it's haunting.
What's haunting about it?

1770
01:46:06.201 --> 01:46:09.890
You can't tell what direction it really came from.
A couple of years ago,

1771
01:46:09.891 --> 01:46:14.290
I was out on a reveal the island or reveleigh Giga Doe Island in Southeast

1772
01:46:14.300 --> 01:46:17.540
Alaska and we were messing around there one day and we got up on this big high

1773
01:46:17.541 --> 01:46:22.390
ridge and I could hear five or six of these things going off,
you know,

1774
01:46:22.610 --> 01:46:24.770
w w w and I just thought,
man,

1775
01:46:24.771 --> 01:46:28.160
we'd come back here and pound them because Alaska is the only place you can hunt

1776
01:46:28.161 --> 01:46:32.570
these birds in the spring.
They call it the spring hooter season.
Um,

1777
01:46:32.780 --> 01:46:37.520
I thought I'd just be a matter of going up there and here in it and walking down

1778
01:46:37.521 --> 01:46:42.320
and getting it.
So we even talked about doing an episode.

1779
01:46:42.321 --> 01:46:44.990
It was 22 minutes long with no tape,
no cuts.

1780
01:46:45.110 --> 01:46:49.980
It would just play straight time from the time you heard one

1781
01:46:50.520 --> 01:46:52.230
<v 4>to the time you shot at time it out.</v>

1782
01:46:52.231 --> 01:46:54.990
So we would just run a continuous loop of film.

1783
01:46:55.890 --> 01:47:00.180
Now we went out and started looking for the first burden and about like 10 hours

1784
01:47:00.181 --> 01:47:02.910
into trying to find the first bird.
We realize you are not going to do that.

1785
01:47:03.360 --> 01:47:06.330
Can't find them,
but you can.

1786
01:47:06.390 --> 01:47:09.690
I learned how then very difficult to find them because it's just a ventriloquist

1787
01:47:09.691 --> 01:47:14.070
sound.
It's just like you can't locate the sound.
I had a guy,

1788
01:47:14.360 --> 01:47:17.940
is there a game call company where I knew some guys called down and dirty game

1789
01:47:17.941 --> 01:47:22.941
calls and I sent them a bunch of sound recordings that are on the Cornell

1790
01:47:25.290 --> 01:47:25.890
University website.

1791
01:47:25.890 --> 01:47:28.830
They have this all like everyone McCall the library of bird sounds.

1792
01:47:28.890 --> 01:47:32.610
I sent them some of the sounds that the females make and the females make noise.

1793
01:47:32.611 --> 01:47:34.440
It sounds like it's almost like,

1794
01:47:37.030 --> 01:47:40.260
and uh,
they made me a call that sounds like that.

1795
01:47:40.980 --> 01:47:43.530
And I played the other,
the male sound,

1796
01:47:43.531 --> 01:47:47.910
the w w sound to musician friends and people that have been like,

1797
01:47:47.911 --> 01:47:49.470
what in the world would make that sound?

1798
01:47:49.471 --> 01:47:53.410
And people talked about this Australian instrument that my degree duty.
Yeah,

1799
01:47:53.420 --> 01:47:56.190
they said that,
that you could maybe use that.
We tried beer bottles,

1800
01:47:56.191 --> 01:47:58.770
all kinds of stuff.
I like blowing over the top.
Yeah.

1801
01:47:58.900 --> 01:48:00.660
Could never make it satisfactory sound.

1802
01:48:00.661 --> 01:48:05.661
But I got to where I was making a female sound and in this guy I know in Utah

1803
01:48:06.810 --> 01:48:09.170
named Shad Brunson,
um,

1804
01:48:09.390 --> 01:48:14.390
got me a female blue grouse and I had to go to a tax nerd,

1805
01:48:14.791 --> 01:48:19.530
misnamed Colton in Montana and he stuffed that blue grouse for me.

1806
01:48:19.560 --> 01:48:23.880
Just a real rudimentary stuff job.
And I took that thing out and I would,

1807
01:48:24.120 --> 01:48:26.280
I would hear why I could hear a bird by,

1808
01:48:26.281 --> 01:48:27.390
couldn't tell where I was hearing it from,

1809
01:48:27.391 --> 01:48:32.280
but I'd get where I kind of knew I was in the area he was in and set that decoy

1810
01:48:32.281 --> 01:48:35.700
out the hand and then make the call,

1811
01:48:35.790 --> 01:48:40.230
like attending call that they make to their young nick,
nick,
nick,
nick,
and um,

1812
01:48:40.800 --> 01:48:45.180
nothing,
nothing.
They didn't give a shit,
couldn't,

1813
01:48:45.240 --> 01:48:50.070
couldn't call him in.
Uh,
yeah.
And uh,

1814
01:48:50.130 --> 01:48:52.800
man,
it was just really frustrating.
And then I wound up

1815
01:48:54.460 --> 01:48:58.820
finding,
I was so pissed about how this was going and sold,

1816
01:48:58.821 --> 01:49:00.640
like baffled that I couldn't find these birds.

1817
01:49:00.641 --> 01:49:04.060
I called my brother who put me in touch with a body of his,

1818
01:49:04.570 --> 01:49:07.600
who put me in touch with a buddy of his,

1819
01:49:08.080 --> 01:49:12.040
who knew a guy who knew a lady who was very,

1820
01:49:12.100 --> 01:49:13.840
very good at finding blue grouse

1821
01:49:15.950 --> 01:49:19.190
and she's audit Juneau,
Alaska.
And uh,

1822
01:49:19.700 --> 01:49:24.700
I went hunting with her and we were standing under growls and to treat by nine

1823
01:49:24.801 --> 01:49:28.190
30 in the morning,
the first day after spending four days.

1824
01:49:29.110 --> 01:49:29.720
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1825
01:49:29.720 --> 01:49:33.680
<v 4>And found a bird one bird.
Yeah.
She and I,</v>

1826
01:49:33.710 --> 01:49:35.990
we were together for three days.
I think we've found 15 of them.

1827
01:49:36.740 --> 01:49:39.800
She just knew how to find them.
When she hears that noise,

1828
01:49:39.801 --> 01:49:42.620
she's hearing something to,
I don't hear.
Wow.

1829
01:49:42.800 --> 01:49:47.620
Well that's a tenacity I'm talking about.
Yeah.
She's got it bad.
Barb

1830
01:49:49.570 --> 01:49:52.760
is a tenacious,
tenacious hunter.
But you know,
my older brother I,

1831
01:49:52.850 --> 01:49:54.270
but he's got this term,
um,

1832
01:49:54.880 --> 01:49:59.560
he talks about people having girl girl,
like,
yeah.

1833
01:49:59.780 --> 01:50:03.850
Hmm.
And like he's got a lot of girls when it comes to hunting.

1834
01:50:06.130 --> 01:50:08.890
I got a lot of girls.
That's my only thing I'm going to actually,
like,

1835
01:50:09.220 --> 01:50:11.860
I'm not a bad hunter.
I'm definitely not a good honor.

1836
01:50:11.920 --> 01:50:15.790
But what I have going for me is all very good hunter goal for me is I like to

1837
01:50:15.791 --> 01:50:19.060
stick with it.
Yeah.
Well how could you possibly say you're not a good hunter?

1838
01:50:19.870 --> 01:50:24.250
Cause sometimes I go out with guys who were just so good,
just split good.

1839
01:50:24.340 --> 01:50:27.490
But are they good at a specific type of hunting?
They get really good.

1840
01:50:28.480 --> 01:50:32.320
You're a broad spectrum guide and Norma Jean,
I'm a good generalist.

1841
01:50:32.770 --> 01:50:36.550
I'm a good generalist.
But then I'll go out with guys who just know their stuff,

1842
01:50:36.551 --> 01:50:39.130
man,
you know,
and uh,

1843
01:50:40.150 --> 01:50:42.100
and it's a little bit,

1844
01:50:42.160 --> 01:50:45.490
it's almost a little bit shocking when I'm with someone who really knows what

1845
01:50:45.491 --> 01:50:48.520
they're doing and it,
it just,
yeah,

1846
01:50:48.630 --> 01:50:50.040
<v 3>well doesn't that make sense to them?
If you,</v>

1847
01:50:50.041 --> 01:50:55.041
if you go on doing that with a guy who only hunts mule deer in Utah and this guy

1848
01:50:55.531 --> 01:50:58.470
just patterns meal deer every year,
he knows all the trails.

1849
01:50:58.471 --> 01:51:02.730
He spends time in the spring,
like searching for them.

1850
01:51:02.790 --> 01:51:05.970
He spots them.
It keeps an eye on them.
He's watching them,

1851
01:51:06.150 --> 01:51:08.250
he's getting ready for the season to open up.
I mean,

1852
01:51:08.251 --> 01:51:11.700
that guy is obviously going to have a greater database of information about mule

1853
01:51:11.701 --> 01:51:15.330
deer than a guy.
Like you just got back from Bolivia eat and a monkey,

1854
01:51:15.600 --> 01:51:19.860
and then you,
you know,
you arrive in a,
you did eat a monkey.
Yeah.

1855
01:51:20.280 --> 01:51:22.150
I want to talk to you about that too.
That was a,

1856
01:51:22.151 --> 01:51:26.040
that was a crazy fucking episode.
Um,
it has a fascinating episode two,

1857
01:51:26.041 --> 01:51:29.340
because you're talking about like ancient stuff in ancient methods and,

1858
01:51:29.341 --> 01:51:34.341
and did the difference between people that are eating or existing primarily just

1859
01:51:35.250 --> 01:51:36.900
they're so assisting Hein.
I mean,
they're not,

1860
01:51:37.020 --> 01:51:38.820
there's no sport involved in what they're doing at all.

1861
01:51:38.850 --> 01:51:40.020
They're just trying to survive.

1862
01:51:40.090 --> 01:51:45.090
<v 4>Yeah,
man,
they,
they loved the,
well,
this was,
I want to point out real quick,</v>

1863
01:51:45.270 --> 01:51:49.110
uh,
one guy that I,
one guy that I hung with,

1864
01:51:49.120 --> 01:51:53.400
it's just like good and you know,
on the Remi Oh wow.
Yeah,

1865
01:51:53.610 --> 01:51:58.320
Remy Warren's very like,
like I would,
you know,
I,

1866
01:51:58.350 --> 01:52:00.430
I don't use this word very often to describe hundreds.

1867
01:52:00.460 --> 01:52:03.990
He was what I would call a talented hunter,
the cast talent.

1868
01:52:04.620 --> 01:52:09.090
Like it's just,
he gets it,
you know?
Um,

1869
01:52:10.320 --> 01:52:13.980
so
we were down in Bolivia.

1870
01:52:14.650 --> 01:52:17.640
Haven't had we not,
I haven't been on your podcast talking about this.

1871
01:52:17.700 --> 01:52:18.533
I don't believe so.

1872
01:52:18.720 --> 01:52:21.450
I don't think you've been on the podcast since he got back from Bolivia.

1873
01:52:21.690 --> 01:52:25.230
Have you?
I don't think I made it.
I don't think so.
So we were down in Bolivia.

1874
01:52:25.231 --> 01:52:29.310
We went down there to go up a river like a,

1875
01:52:29.311 --> 01:52:33.390
sorry river with these,
uh,
and travel with the Chimani,

1876
01:52:33.420 --> 01:52:37.890
which is an autonomous indigenous group in Bolivia.
Um,

1877
01:52:39.360 --> 01:52:41.730
you might know a way to approach thinking about it.

1878
01:52:41.731 --> 01:52:46.430
Where do you think about the reservation system that we have here in the u s

1879
01:52:46.431 --> 01:52:50.510
where there's,
you know,
a fair bit of autonomy on reservations.

1880
01:52:50.511 --> 01:52:52.160
Like they might be able to have a casino,
you know,

1881
01:52:52.610 --> 01:52:56.720
all this stuff that violates state law because they're,
they're uh,
you know,

1882
01:52:56.721 --> 01:53:00.950
like I was sort of a nation within a nation and Bolivia had these huge areas of

1883
01:53:00.951 --> 01:53:02.520
jungle,
um,

1884
01:53:03.110 --> 01:53:05.990
that are autonomous zones and we were in like the Trimont area,

1885
01:53:06.110 --> 01:53:09.140
so they are self governing.
Um,

1886
01:53:10.010 --> 01:53:12.950
we went and traveled up a,
a revenue stream,
like a basic river trip.

1887
01:53:13.520 --> 01:53:15.110
At the surface level.

1888
01:53:15.620 --> 01:53:18.000
We're going down there to fish a type of fish called [inaudible].

1889
01:53:18.001 --> 01:53:20.760
But the main thing I was interested in was just traveling with and,

1890
01:53:20.810 --> 01:53:22.040
and hunting with these guys.

1891
01:53:22.670 --> 01:53:27.320
And they hunt with bows for the most part.

1892
01:53:27.680 --> 01:53:31.970
Firearms are starting to come into their area,
but they hunt fish with Bose,

1893
01:53:32.330 --> 01:53:34.550
homemade boats.
Um,

1894
01:53:34.970 --> 01:53:39.970
and they hunt birds with bows and they do some big game hunting with bows,

1895
01:53:40.551 --> 01:53:40.970
but there,

1896
01:53:40.970 --> 01:53:45.140
but 90% of their protein comes out of the river in the form of fish and they

1897
01:53:45.141 --> 01:53:49.220
poisoned fish with a plant.
So we went out,

1898
01:53:49.250 --> 01:53:52.250
we went into a village and they were,
they were cultivating one of these plants.

1899
01:53:52.251 --> 01:53:54.740
There's a handful of plants down there and does it like we use a fish poison

1900
01:53:54.741 --> 01:53:58.340
here in the u s when we're trying to get rid of invasives or whatever called

1901
01:53:58.341 --> 01:53:59.170
wrote,

1902
01:53:59.170 --> 01:54:03.650
wrote is a root is derived from a root of a South American plant.

1903
01:54:04.220 --> 01:54:06.170
And,
uh,
these guys had leaf,

1904
01:54:06.920 --> 01:54:11.920
they had a tree that bar just like a green waxy leaf and you'd pound that into a

1905
01:54:12.141 --> 01:54:15.620
pulp and you'd go out and they'd go out and do a river and they've tried to find

1906
01:54:15.621 --> 01:54:18.470
a little channel,
like an isolated channel,

1907
01:54:18.560 --> 01:54:21.350
a river pool that doesn't have a lot of current coming into it.

1908
01:54:22.190 --> 01:54:27.020
And they'll pull up that plant and put it into a woven bag and just go out in

1909
01:54:27.021 --> 01:54:31.730
the water and stir the pulped up leaves in there.

1910
01:54:31.731 --> 01:54:33.890
And pretty soon all the fish come up in the Fisher suffocating.

1911
01:54:33.920 --> 01:54:37.790
It somehow affects efficiency,
ability to pull oxygen from the water.

1912
01:54:38.150 --> 01:54:42.320
So the fish come up and they're gasping for air at the surface and then they

1913
01:54:42.321 --> 01:54:47.030
just shoot the fish of their bows.
Um,
they do some netting for fish,

1914
01:54:47.360 --> 01:54:48.830
but most of its bow hunt.

1915
01:54:49.130 --> 01:54:53.390
And I fell in with a couple older guys there and we did some hunting and one of

1916
01:54:53.391 --> 01:54:56.030
these guys had only ever hunted with a bow,

1917
01:54:56.630 --> 01:55:00.680
but a year earlier he'd gone into some town in,

1918
01:55:00.681 --> 01:55:05.681
somehow got a Russian made 16 gauge single shot shotgun.

1919
01:55:08.210 --> 01:55:12.290
Um,
that was on,
it was held together with wire.

1920
01:55:12.710 --> 01:55:17.710
I was nervous about being around him when this is going on and they like to hunt

1921
01:55:18.801 --> 01:55:22.130
at night because now they have flashlights.

1922
01:55:22.550 --> 01:55:26.540
So they got flashlights and they got a shotgun and they got their bows and we

1923
01:55:26.541 --> 01:55:30.380
would,
they would wait until dusk and then we would head off into the jungle.

1924
01:55:30.381 --> 01:55:34.070
And these guys,
only s uh,
they speak their native language,

1925
01:55:34.071 --> 01:55:37.160
they know teeny bit of Spanish but they speak Chimani.

1926
01:55:37.700 --> 01:55:42.080
I would go out with them and I would have no idea what they're talking about and

1927
01:55:42.081 --> 01:55:45.900
we would leave at dusk and just go into the jungle and the noise of the jungle

1928
01:55:45.901 --> 01:55:48.960
at night just deafening if you never experienced,
I mean it's like,

1929
01:55:49.380 --> 01:55:50.580
it's the point where,

1930
01:55:50.760 --> 01:55:53.420
I mean have you ever been out in a windy area for long time?

1931
01:55:53.421 --> 01:55:56.400
We start to feel like it's like affecting your sanity or affecting your ability

1932
01:55:56.401 --> 01:56:00.940
to think clearly.
You know,
or worn around like small aircraft,

1933
01:56:00.941 --> 01:56:05.170
that engine noise.
You don't realize how agitated it's making UNT.

1934
01:56:05.220 --> 01:56:06.480
You get away from it and you'll all sudden,

1935
01:56:06.481 --> 01:56:09.270
it feels like the relaxing in some way.

1936
01:56:10.050 --> 01:56:12.060
The noise of the jungles so loud,

1937
01:56:12.061 --> 01:56:16.590
it's almost like that at night with the bugs and stuff going off and we go out

1938
01:56:16.620 --> 01:56:17.790
into the jungle and uh,

1939
01:56:19.410 --> 01:56:21.960
I knew from going into it that their favorite food,

1940
01:56:22.050 --> 01:56:24.240
even though they drive 90% of their protein from the river,

1941
01:56:24.241 --> 01:56:28.860
their favorite food is a spider monkey and their second favorite foods,

1942
01:56:29.160 --> 01:56:32.370
howler monkey.
And before it even gets dark out,

1943
01:56:32.371 --> 01:56:36.870
we go down this trail for a while through the jungle and they come to a date

1944
01:56:36.871 --> 01:56:41.250
tree and dates we'll fruit periodically throughout the year and you know,

1945
01:56:41.251 --> 01:56:44.400
you're close,
you're getting closer to the equator now they're sold.

1946
01:56:44.401 --> 01:56:46.480
There's not like you don't have the seasonality as much.

1947
01:56:46.481 --> 01:56:50.130
So plants or fruit all the time rather than just in the summertime and they get

1948
01:56:50.131 --> 01:56:51.180
to this date Trina's date,

1949
01:56:51.181 --> 01:56:56.181
trees fruiting and he's looking at these dates on the ground and he finds some

1950
01:56:57.721 --> 01:57:00.780
shit that on now realize most have been monkey shit and they got real interested

1951
01:57:00.781 --> 01:57:04.980
in what was going on up above us.
And pretty soon he sees a,

1952
01:57:05.310 --> 01:57:10.310
this howler monkey starts going through the tree tops and he shoots it down out

1953
01:57:10.711 --> 01:57:13.080
of the tree with a,
with that shotgun he had with him.

1954
01:57:14.250 --> 01:57:19.250
And first thing he does is he takes the tail because the tail off the monkey,

1955
01:57:19.561 --> 01:57:22.440
the tip of the Monkey's tail and buries it in the ground.

1956
01:57:22.920 --> 01:57:26.190
I couldn't even ask him why he was doing his blade or I learned it's you do
that.

1957
01:57:26.191 --> 01:57:29.970
So the next monkey you kill,
he doesn't get hung up in the tree buys tail.

1958
01:57:31.380 --> 01:57:34.740
Then just like a belief,
you know,

1959
01:57:36.600 --> 01:57:41.600
then he cuts some bark off a tree and makes little harness so he can carry the

1960
01:57:42.421 --> 01:57:45.120
monkey over his,
across his chest.

1961
01:57:45.210 --> 01:57:50.100
So He's just got the monkey slung on him like a baby carrier.
And uh,

1962
01:57:50.190 --> 01:57:53.010
we just had often in the jungle and hunt for several hours at night.

1963
01:57:53.940 --> 01:57:58.940
And then the next day when we got back and they gutted the monkey out and kept

1964
01:58:00.811 --> 01:58:03.030
all the intestines and everything out of that monkey.

1965
01:58:03.300 --> 01:58:08.300
And eventually they burned the hair off it and trust it like how you'd trust a

1966
01:58:08.380 --> 01:58:13.380
Turkey and smoked it over a fire and I did not want to eat a monkey.

1967
01:58:14.010 --> 01:58:17.310
Like it did not want to eat a primate,
you know?

1968
01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:20.850
But that point I'd been out with them and you know I was going to eat it.

1969
01:58:20.851 --> 01:58:24.570
It was very difficult for me to enjoy psychologically.

1970
01:58:24.630 --> 01:58:29.630
I had the same problem being in Vietnam and being served domestic dog where I

1971
01:58:30.421 --> 01:58:35.421
ate I domestic dog seven nights in a row and just was ne people go there.

1972
01:58:36.541 --> 01:58:38.280
What did it taste like?
I was like,
I can't even tell you.

1973
01:58:39.170 --> 01:58:44.170
It was like something I would get so hot like my body would feel so hot eaten

1974
01:58:45.051 --> 01:58:46.480
that just like,

1975
01:58:46.481 --> 01:58:51.400
it's like just this like wrongness we'll see is like because of nerves.
Yeah man.

1976
01:58:51.640 --> 01:58:55.240
I couldn't tell what it tastes like.
Logical.
He,
yeah,
very hard.
Eat the monkey.

1977
01:58:55.480 --> 01:58:57.670
If I could say what it tastes like eating that monkey.

1978
01:58:57.671 --> 01:59:00.820
It tasted like if you took steel cable and put liquid smoke on it,

1979
01:59:02.740 --> 01:59:07.570
they loved it.
Why do they,
what will they have a specific preference?

1980
01:59:07.930 --> 01:59:10.780
They like howler over spider,
a spider over Howard.

1981
01:59:10.781 --> 01:59:15.370
Would you like spiders now why a couple nights later we're coming back from

1982
01:59:15.371 --> 01:59:17.230
fishing one night and we had,

1983
01:59:18.310 --> 01:59:23.310
we had a giant catfish with us and a handful of other fish with us and we're

1984
01:59:25.840 --> 01:59:27.730
coming back to the jungle.
It's just getting,

1985
01:59:28.510 --> 01:59:32.470
starting to come on to darkness and they see another kind of monkey.
Oh,

1986
01:59:32.560 --> 01:59:37.300
I came here like Poo j or PJ or some,
what they call it in their language,

1987
01:59:37.301 --> 01:59:39.010
but a another kind of monkey and I'm like,

1988
01:59:39.011 --> 01:59:43.090
surely they're gonna go after this monkey.
No interest net monkey,
not a good one.

1989
01:59:43.420 --> 01:59:45.580
The same night they got the red howler monkey,

1990
01:59:47.290 --> 01:59:49.990
we go down the trail and it's just getting dark and I see a possum.

1991
01:59:51.160 --> 01:59:54.760
Same Marsupial oh saint possibly we have here and I'm like,

1992
01:59:54.761 --> 01:59:57.250
surely these guys are going to want that.
If Bailey to damn monkey,

1993
01:59:57.251 --> 01:59:59.920
they're going to want a possum.
People in the u s e possums,

1994
02:00:00.430 --> 02:00:03.070
they look at that thing in his walk by like it doesn't even exist.

1995
02:00:03.760 --> 02:00:07.390
And later I was able to ask them through like by asking them,

1996
02:00:07.420 --> 02:00:10.390
by asking someone who speaks some Spanish,
he was able to,

1997
02:00:10.630 --> 02:00:13.090
so it was like a threeway translation.
I was like,

1998
02:00:13.091 --> 02:00:14.560
why didn't you guys want the possum?

1999
02:00:15.330 --> 02:00:18.850
And he explained to me that you'd only eat a possum if you were real hungry.

2000
02:00:20.140 --> 02:00:24.910
But meanwhile thereafter monkey and when they get a monkey,

2001
02:00:24.911 --> 02:00:29.180
it's a party.
A party.
Yeah.
Everybody comes in,

2002
02:00:29.181 --> 02:00:32.050
they're real excited and a thing I say in the show,

2003
02:00:32.051 --> 02:00:35.920
we did a whole three part series about Bolivia and the Chimani.
But

2004
02:00:37.480 --> 02:00:40.910
the thing I say in the show when we're talking about this is think of th th

2005
02:00:41.160 --> 02:00:46.160
there's only two things I know about that that get the kind of enthusiasm from a

2006
02:00:48.701 --> 02:00:52.960
culinary perspective in the u s to get the kind of enthusiasm needed guys had

2007
02:00:52.961 --> 02:00:57.760
from monkeys.
It'd be someone who has homegrown tomatoes in Morel.

2008
02:00:57.761 --> 02:01:02.440
Mushrooms are the only things I know about that people have that level of love

2009
02:01:02.441 --> 02:01:02.710
for it.

2010
02:01:02.710 --> 02:01:06.760
They were more excited about eating that red howler monkey than you've ever been

2011
02:01:06.761 --> 02:01:09.010
about eating anything you ever ate.
I promise you.

2012
02:01:09.730 --> 02:01:13.930
And they eat him on a regular basis?
No,
no,
they hadn't gotten,
they had,

2013
02:01:14.410 --> 02:01:16.450
they rarely go up to this area.

2014
02:01:17.680 --> 02:01:20.560
And that's one of the reasons I like to go up to this areas cause you can get

2015
02:01:20.561 --> 02:01:23.260
monkeys.
They hadn't had a monkey for eight months I think I remember,

2016
02:01:23.320 --> 02:01:24.280
I think it was eight months.

2017
02:01:24.281 --> 02:01:27.460
They had had those last time they had gone into an area where they would,

2018
02:01:27.461 --> 02:01:29.350
where they would find the Monkees.

2019
02:01:29.351 --> 02:01:32.830
So did you specifically ask them to go to this area where the monkeys were or

2020
02:01:32.831 --> 02:01:35.890
was it just weird?
Is going into an area that's like the happy hunting grounds.

2021
02:01:36.490 --> 02:01:37.450
Why?
Lot of fee.

2022
02:01:37.480 --> 02:01:41.990
They were very excited to go and it was several days up river.

2023
02:01:42.140 --> 02:01:44.780
It's like apocalypse now.
They're very excited to go up.

2024
02:01:44.781 --> 02:01:48.830
Does Eric Cyr they like to go to,
to hunt and fish.
So this,

2025
02:01:48.831 --> 02:01:53.470
so this monkey thing tastes like steel cable.
Like it was just chilling.

2026
02:01:53.480 --> 02:01:55.610
The smoked Turkey drumstick?
Yes.
Okay.

2027
02:01:55.611 --> 02:01:58.790
Imagine the lowest part on that smokey Turkey drumstick where you're getting

2028
02:01:58.791 --> 02:02:02.480
close to the joint.
Just pulling it off.
That's what that money is there.

2029
02:02:02.690 --> 02:02:04.130
But I'll tell you something.
It's like,

2030
02:02:05.060 --> 02:02:05.893
<v 6>well,</v>

2031
02:02:07.680 --> 02:02:10.620
<v 4>they had a baby monkey at one point.
Okay.</v>

2032
02:02:10.680 --> 02:02:15.680
A very young baby monkey at one point and they just cooked it in a walk and I

2033
02:02:16.261 --> 02:02:20.130
wasn't even offered any of that.
It just save that for themselves.

2034
02:02:20.131 --> 02:02:21.300
Couple of the guys had it.

2035
02:02:21.540 --> 02:02:26.220
I remember one of them had a like a head in the bowl loaning.
Jeez.
It was funny.

2036
02:02:26.230 --> 02:02:28.980
Bodies to dude.
It was funny about it is I remember being in a,

2037
02:02:30.850 --> 02:02:31.683
<v 6>I've ever,</v>

2038
02:02:32.800 --> 02:02:33.930
<v 4>no,
I did,</v>

2039
02:02:33.980 --> 02:02:38.980
I hunted with another like an indigenous group and in a Guyana and uh,

2040
02:02:39.441 --> 02:02:43.260
I remember this guy had a shirt with Muhammad Ali on it and um,

2041
02:02:43.280 --> 02:02:46.730
I was trying to ask him about it.
He didn't,
he had no idea.
And another one,

2042
02:02:46.731 --> 02:02:49.850
I had a shirt from a pizza place.
He had no idea what pizza was.

2043
02:02:50.430 --> 02:02:53.060
Not the day you have a responsibility to know about Muhammad,
I'll eat pizza.

2044
02:02:53.061 --> 02:02:57.380
But just saying like,
for them to hear that,

2045
02:02:57.800 --> 02:02:59.570
for them to hear from us,
be like,
dude,

2046
02:03:00.080 --> 02:03:04.850
it is very rare to eat a monkey.
You know,

2047
02:03:05.510 --> 02:03:08.810
it was just to them,
it was just baffling.
It was like they weren't like,

2048
02:03:08.811 --> 02:03:11.870
yeah I know some people don't like it.
You know,

2049
02:03:11.871 --> 02:03:14.960
like if you go down and someone gives you squirrel brains are like,
yeah man,

2050
02:03:14.961 --> 02:03:16.490
it's kind of fucked up.
We eat squirrel brains.

2051
02:03:16.820 --> 02:03:20.990
Like no it was just in their mind I was like their fathers,
grandfathers,

2052
02:03:20.991 --> 02:03:25.070
great grandfathers,
great,
great grandfather's like howler monkey.

2053
02:03:25.610 --> 02:03:27.500
How would you not be excited about this?

2054
02:03:28.030 --> 02:03:31.340
W they no idea of it being like globally fringe.

2055
02:03:32.030 --> 02:03:37.030
It's just so strange that we don't have their language available.

2056
02:03:37.310 --> 02:03:39.890
So it's a,
you can't have like a real conversation about it.

2057
02:03:39.891 --> 02:03:43.580
Like what is it about this that you enjoy more?
Cause you guys shot a deer too,

2058
02:03:43.850 --> 02:03:45.590
but they wanted the monkey more than the deal.

2059
02:03:45.620 --> 02:03:47.960
They liked the deer more than a monkey net.
Dear was phenomenal.

2060
02:03:47.961 --> 02:03:51.030
They want the deer more than them.
I don't really like the monkey more than,

2061
02:03:51.050 --> 02:03:54.680
than the deer.
Deer was very good.
They were very glad about the deer.

2062
02:03:54.800 --> 02:03:58.330
But they like the monkey more than the deer.
What do they think about your bow?

2063
02:03:58.460 --> 02:04:00.020
Cause you,
you,
they're blown away.

2064
02:04:00.380 --> 02:04:03.800
They were blown away by compound bow I had,

2065
02:04:03.830 --> 02:04:07.610
did you feel like you wanted to leave it with them?
You know,

2066
02:04:08.120 --> 02:04:10.550
but if you did they wouldn't be able to get arrows for it anyway.
Yeah,

2067
02:04:10.551 --> 02:04:13.340
there's that and like you have all these weird,
uh,

2068
02:04:15.020 --> 02:04:16.130
hanging out with people,

2069
02:04:16.131 --> 02:04:21.020
like with people who like that you have all of these weird hangups or at least I

2070
02:04:21.021 --> 02:04:26.021
do like all this like colonial type guilt or something where you don't want to,

2071
02:04:28.400 --> 02:04:33.210
I'll put it to you this way.
I was bummed that that guy had that shotgun.
Really?

2072
02:04:33.320 --> 02:04:36.530
He's glad as hell.
Right?
It's the greatest thing that ever happened to him.

2073
02:04:36.870 --> 02:04:40.830
He's Damn Shotgun,
right?
He couldn't be happier.

2074
02:04:41.590 --> 02:04:45.590
But I was like,
man,
you know,
I just wish you didn't have that shotgun.

2075
02:04:45.600 --> 02:04:48.260
You start to hunt with your bow.
So it's like me,
you're,

2076
02:04:48.261 --> 02:04:52.410
you're exercising some kind of weird,
I don't want to call it like races.

2077
02:04:52.440 --> 02:04:54.580
It's not racism.
It's something,

2078
02:04:54.990 --> 02:04:59.130
it's just like some kind of like the new colonial is a puritan aspect of it or

2079
02:04:59.131 --> 02:05:02.640
pure,
pure.
Like,
for instance,
there's these guys down there,

2080
02:05:02.690 --> 02:05:06.300
there's these Bolivians who are from the urban area down there like of your,

2081
02:05:06.350 --> 02:05:10.920
like a of mixed European indigenous ancestry and theirs,
they're very,

2082
02:05:11.220 --> 02:05:16.110
like in Bolivia,
the ruling class,
the urban people are very different than,
than,

2083
02:05:16.170 --> 02:05:20.580
than the indigenous people.
Okay.
There is,
they have it,

2084
02:05:21.480 --> 02:05:22.740
I don't want to say categorically,

2085
02:05:22.741 --> 02:05:26.670
but there's a view of the indigenous people that would've seen more like the

2086
02:05:26.671 --> 02:05:29.190
1870 [inaudible] here in the u s in some circles.

2087
02:05:29.191 --> 02:05:32.400
The way they view the backwardness of the indigenous people and trying to bring

2088
02:05:32.401 --> 02:05:34.920
out missionaries to,
you know,

2089
02:05:35.280 --> 02:05:39.060
help them find religion and get them to settle down and stop being nomadic.

2090
02:05:39.061 --> 02:05:39.690
And you know,

2091
02:05:39.690 --> 02:05:42.960
there's all this kind of stuff that we were having that conversation 150 years

2092
02:05:42.961 --> 02:05:44.730
ago here.
Um,

2093
02:05:46.680 --> 02:05:48.300
there's these guys who are doing these trips.

2094
02:05:48.301 --> 02:05:51.420
So who we orchestrated our trip through who are trying to introduce these guys

2095
02:05:51.520 --> 02:05:56.220
[inaudible] they're trying to get these guys hip to the idea of not eaten one of

2096
02:05:56.221 --> 02:05:56.941
their favorite fish,

2097
02:05:56.941 --> 02:06:01.941
which is the Durado because rich white guys will pay a lot of money to come down

2098
02:06:02.521 --> 02:06:03.360
and catch Durado.

2099
02:06:03.420 --> 02:06:06.960
That was kind of our end to go down here was to go up to this area where they

2100
02:06:06.961 --> 02:06:11.730
catch Durado.
So they're trying to sell these dudes on not messing with Dorado.

2101
02:06:14.220 --> 02:06:15.510
I was bummed out about that.

2102
02:06:15.540 --> 02:06:19.100
Like I hated seeing that because that's her favorite fish,
man.
Will you tell?

2103
02:06:19.180 --> 02:06:23.580
You're trying to tell them that like now we want to tell them that not eat their

2104
02:06:23.581 --> 02:06:24.870
favorite fish because guys like me,

2105
02:06:24.871 --> 02:06:27.210
you might want to come down and catch the thing and it's not even going to have

2106
02:06:27.211 --> 02:06:29.290
a negative implication ramification anyway,

2107
02:06:29.300 --> 02:06:32.260
so you're not going to over harvest them with bows and arrows,
you know?
Right.

2108
02:06:32.730 --> 02:06:35.010
But it's just like this weird thing.
So yeah,
I didn't like it.

2109
02:06:35.011 --> 02:06:37.320
The guy had the shotgun,
even though he was glad about the shotgun.

2110
02:06:37.830 --> 02:06:42.510
I had my boat when I brought my bow down,
that my main goal and having a bow,

2111
02:06:43.100 --> 02:06:46.080
yeah,
you're not going to get a firearm down there.
Like they can't have firearms,

2112
02:06:46.170 --> 02:06:48.900
not supposed to have firearms.
So I was gonna bring a firearm.

2113
02:06:48.900 --> 02:06:50.460
I would never be able to get it in there anyways.

2114
02:06:50.640 --> 02:06:54.630
It'd probably been very bad to bring it.
Um,
but I could bring a bow,
no problem.

2115
02:06:56.220 --> 02:06:59.340
My main goal in bringing the bowl was it,
I would have like some,
uh,

2116
02:07:00.600 --> 02:07:04.470
that I would establish some credibility with them.
And it did.

2117
02:07:05.460 --> 02:07:06.000
When I,

2118
02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:09.390
we got up and I was shooting their bowls and doing some fishing with their

2119
02:07:09.391 --> 02:07:13.020
equipment and stuff.
When I got out my bow,
they were like,

2120
02:07:14.820 --> 02:07:18.360
yeah,
very,
very surprised by a compound bow.

2121
02:07:19.060 --> 02:07:22.220
When you see how fast the Arrow shoot,
they couldn't believe it.
They,

2122
02:07:22.240 --> 02:07:25.030
a lot of them wouldn't,
they didn't want to shoot at someone wants,
shoot it.

2123
02:07:25.720 --> 02:07:30.000
A lot of them are like,
just deeply that out.
I'm not impressing me,

2124
02:07:30.001 --> 02:07:32.530
but was impressed by the technology.
Did you let them shoot it?
Yeah,

2125
02:07:32.550 --> 02:07:36.580
let a couple of them shooting wrist release.
Oh.
But it was just like they'd,

2126
02:07:36.920 --> 02:07:40.280
you know,
it's hard to keep them from dry firing.
I mean she's like,

2127
02:07:40.290 --> 02:07:42.970
cause you can't tell like I can't explain to,
right.

2128
02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:44.140
So you're trying to demonstrate things.

2129
02:07:44.160 --> 02:07:46.630
Those someone was going to get hurt shooting the boat.
Right.

2130
02:07:46.920 --> 02:07:47.770
And these weren't like,

2131
02:07:47.800 --> 02:07:50.830
and you know what's funny is these guys that beat my ass all over town,

2132
02:07:50.890 --> 02:07:52.550
a lot of them couldn't come close to pulling the bow back.

2133
02:07:53.020 --> 02:07:57.460
That's how heavy is the ball.
70 they couldn't pull it back.
No.
Cause it's,

2134
02:07:57.520 --> 02:08:01.060
you develop a muscle for pulling those bolts back and he's the guy that beat my

2135
02:08:01.061 --> 02:08:03.340
ass.
They couldn't believe how hard that bowl was pulled back.

2136
02:08:03.341 --> 02:08:06.640
And I just wanted to be like,
it's just,
I just can pull,
cause I pulled bows,

2137
02:08:07.240 --> 02:08:09.870
you know?
Hmm.
It's hard.
Yeah.
It's like they had a,

2138
02:08:09.871 --> 02:08:12.650
I'm sure if they had to spend a day at it,
they would have gotten the pull down.

2139
02:08:12.650 --> 02:08:16.060
But just different.
They're like going about it.
How they pulled their longbows.

2140
02:08:16.090 --> 02:08:18.460
Right.
It's just a different kind of thing.
You know,

2141
02:08:18.610 --> 02:08:22.570
you have their bows didn't seem very strong.
No,
not at all.
Not at all.

2142
02:08:22.600 --> 02:08:23.381
So it's just about,

2143
02:08:23.381 --> 02:08:27.280
and they had really long arrows to which is super long arrows and they would

2144
02:08:27.281 --> 02:08:30.460
carry three kinds of tips.
They carry a big game tip of bird tip and a fish tips.

2145
02:08:30.461 --> 02:08:33.400
So every guy's got three arrows with his bow,
but they love that bow.

2146
02:08:33.580 --> 02:08:35.380
But I wound up being,

2147
02:08:35.560 --> 02:08:38.740
I just really wanted to be able to hang out with them and have them not like

2148
02:08:38.741 --> 02:08:41.330
stop.
Like when I would walk up into them where they,

2149
02:08:41.340 --> 02:08:44.800
they'd be standing around eating some fish around their fire and I would walk up

2150
02:08:44.801 --> 02:08:48.700
and then I'll quit eating and I eventually got what we are comfortable together.

2151
02:08:49.090 --> 02:08:51.730
Like they would kind of show me stuff and they kind of,
you know,

2152
02:08:51.731 --> 02:08:52.720
I don't want to say they liked me,

2153
02:08:52.721 --> 02:08:56.230
but they just said sort of accepted me and I eventually got it splain to them

2154
02:08:56.440 --> 02:08:59.950
through actions and otherwise that I was very interested in their food.

2155
02:09:00.250 --> 02:09:02.110
I was very interested in the holiday haunted.

2156
02:09:02.380 --> 02:09:05.500
I would go out into the jungle at night with them.
Know,

2157
02:09:05.510 --> 02:09:08.790
I got stung by a bullet ant and you know,

2158
02:09:08.800 --> 02:09:11.110
and that's excruciating.

2159
02:09:11.111 --> 02:09:13.630
And they watch me kind of like software through that and come out of that.

2160
02:09:13.631 --> 02:09:18.310
And eventually we became friendly,
you know,
and I had the bow or just so,

2161
02:09:18.311 --> 02:09:22.480
cause I wanted to go out and hunt with them and because I had the bowl,

2162
02:09:22.481 --> 02:09:25.710
they were impressed by the bowl and it was just better.
It just worked better.

2163
02:09:25.730 --> 02:09:30.160
Me having a bow.
So they took you in?
Yeah.
Once they saw that they were like,
yeah,

2164
02:09:30.161 --> 02:09:34.230
they felt that um,
you pulled your weight.
Yeah.
They want to kind of like an like,

2165
02:09:34.300 --> 02:09:37.630
you know,
and the guys that we were traveling with those down there with uh,

2166
02:09:38.820 --> 02:09:42.910
Yannis was there,
Dan was there and a guy named Phil was down there,

2167
02:09:42.920 --> 02:09:46.930
camera operator named Phil was down there and we all want to be in like cool

2168
02:09:46.931 --> 02:09:49.960
with these guys,
you know,
like we got along well,
but it took a long,

2169
02:09:49.961 --> 02:09:52.810
it took a long time to get kind of in with him and have him start sort of

2170
02:09:52.811 --> 02:09:55.450
showing you their world a little bit because you,

2171
02:09:55.451 --> 02:10:00.451
you realize that they're used to being viewed there.

2172
02:10:01.670 --> 02:10:06.040
There had been enough exposure to outside to the outside world to realize that

2173
02:10:06.100 --> 02:10:11.100
the outside world usually carried a certain amount of disapproval for their food

2174
02:10:14.021 --> 02:10:15.190
and dress and other things.

2175
02:10:16.690 --> 02:10:20.290
I gathered that was my impression,
but after awhile they were like,
oh,

2176
02:10:20.291 --> 02:10:21.880
this guy's cool.
You know,
when we would just hang out.

2177
02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:23.350
Did you guys have to pay them?

2178
02:10:23.351 --> 02:10:28.351
Like how did they accept you into their fee paid the guys,

2179
02:10:30.130 --> 02:10:35.130
these guys are trying to develop a recreational fishery in this area,

2180
02:10:35.600 --> 02:10:40.400
but they're going into places.
No one goes into and they're trying to establish,

2181
02:10:40.850 --> 02:10:45.590
they were in the process of trying to establish a thing where they would have

2182
02:10:45.591 --> 02:10:50.040
paying clients come down and the paying clients would go on these river trips,

2183
02:10:50.041 --> 02:10:51.980
stop to fish in these areas.

2184
02:10:52.490 --> 02:10:54.740
The only way you can do it because it's Chimani land,

2185
02:10:54.741 --> 02:10:57.530
the only way you can do is by going through the Chimani and the only people

2186
02:10:57.531 --> 02:11:00.440
you're going to hire [inaudible] to get the boats up the rivers and paddle the

2187
02:11:00.441 --> 02:11:03.980
bolts and run the bolts and run the engines and get them stuck out of the wrap.

2188
02:11:03.980 --> 02:11:07.580
It's an all the difficult traveling that involves,

2189
02:11:07.581 --> 02:11:09.170
you'd hire Chimani guys to do it.

2190
02:11:09.770 --> 02:11:14.770
So we hired the guys that hire the Chimani with the sole goal of,

2191
02:11:16.581 --> 02:11:18.400
I was just interested in traveling with the [inaudible].

2192
02:11:18.850 --> 02:11:20.180
How did you get this in your head?

2193
02:11:20.181 --> 02:11:23.210
Like what was it something you researched in advance mean how does,

2194
02:11:23.270 --> 02:11:26.260
how do you make a decision to go to one particular indigenous tribe?

2195
02:11:26.270 --> 02:11:31.020
Because I did a similar thing.
Um,
I did a similar thing for TV down in,

2196
02:11:31.080 --> 02:11:33.060
in Guyana was just blown away by it.

2197
02:11:34.310 --> 02:11:37.250
Just traveling with guys and the guys and Gals,
you know,

2198
02:11:37.610 --> 02:11:41.180
they were still actively hunting with bows in some ways.

2199
02:11:41.181 --> 02:11:45.300
They were a more modernized people,
but they were still avid bow.

2200
02:11:45.301 --> 02:11:49.320
Fishermen hunted with Bose.
I took my boat down there and haunted I,

2201
02:11:49.321 --> 02:11:52.340
I remember I was shadow of big game bird,

2202
02:11:52.341 --> 02:11:55.850
a big Turkey like game bird of a tree with my bow from about 40 yards and they

2203
02:11:55.851 --> 02:11:59.540
were blown away,
man.
Um,
it was just,
it was just,
it's like fun.

2204
02:11:59.541 --> 02:12:04.541
I learned more about hunting and about looking at the landscape and about

2205
02:12:06.020 --> 02:12:11.020
indigenous food paths in those weeks that I've been fortunate to do that kind of

2206
02:12:12.501 --> 02:12:14.120
trip then.

2207
02:12:14.390 --> 02:12:19.120
Then I would learn in years of hunting with American hunters because you gotta

2208
02:12:19.130 --> 02:12:21.860
understand these guys don't,
or let's say you're with someone who's,

2209
02:12:22.280 --> 02:12:25.010
who's 35 years old,
40 years old.

2210
02:12:26.790 --> 02:12:27.660
He's haunted

2211
02:12:30.910 --> 02:12:32.500
probably five,

2212
02:12:32.501 --> 02:12:37.501
six days a week for his entire life within a hundred mile radius of his home.

2213
02:12:42.970 --> 02:12:46.740
The level of understanding that you get,
but it's,

2214
02:12:46.900 --> 02:12:50.260
but it's raw jungle,
you know,
it's like undeveloped jungle.

2215
02:12:50.560 --> 02:12:54.850
The level of understanding you get about what's going on around you.

2216
02:12:54.880 --> 02:12:57.640
It's just different than what we're able to achieve today.

2217
02:12:58.270 --> 02:12:59.300
Especially someone like me who try,

2218
02:12:59.320 --> 02:13:02.140
I travel around a lot and experienced a lot of different things,
but what I,

2219
02:13:02.170 --> 02:13:03.100
what I lack,

2220
02:13:03.101 --> 02:13:06.310
what I miss out on from the way I do things that I missed out on that level of

2221
02:13:06.311 --> 02:13:09.700
detailed,
local understanding that I had as a kid.
For instance,

2222
02:13:09.701 --> 02:13:13.300
for the lake where I grew up,
like I grew up on a newer,
well,
right,

2223
02:13:13.301 --> 02:13:17.620
better than anybody or as good as anybody.
Um,
they have that about the jungle.

2224
02:13:17.830 --> 02:13:21.530
So to go out with guys like that and just watch how they interact and what noise

2225
02:13:21.580 --> 02:13:24.820
make sense to them,
um,
you know,
it's just,

2226
02:13:24.840 --> 02:13:27.940
it's really informative and it just helps you kind of understand humanity
better.

2227
02:13:27.941 --> 02:13:30.380
I remember going out in the jungle with them one night and it's Meryl Summit,

2228
02:13:30.390 --> 02:13:32.040
hold loud it that you can't even

2229
02:13:32.040 --> 02:13:34.470
<v 2>believe how loud it is and all these noises.
You're like,</v>

2230
02:13:34.471 --> 02:13:38.490
what does all this stuff?
It must be whatever.
And then I,
one time I hear a noise.

2231
02:13:38.491 --> 02:13:43.470
It sounds like this often the jungle,
everything,
they just stopped.

2232
02:13:44.180 --> 02:13:48.150
I was like,
oh,
so that noise of the thousands of noises going on,

2233
02:13:48.210 --> 02:13:52.770
this is very interesting to them,
you know?
And what was it?

2234
02:13:52.830 --> 02:13:54.930
I have no idea.
They didn't go after it.

2235
02:13:54.931 --> 02:13:57.270
They just know they were real interested in that.
I was like,

2236
02:13:57.271 --> 02:13:59.250
something made that noise and they're like,

2237
02:13:59.251 --> 02:14:04.020
of all the sticks snapping and things dropping and birds going off and insects,

2238
02:14:04.380 --> 02:14:06.030
you know,
getting bit by bullet ants.

2239
02:14:06.300 --> 02:14:09.120
They hear what sounds like a stick way the hell off.

2240
02:14:09.510 --> 02:14:12.060
And it just means something to them was the bullet.

2241
02:14:12.061 --> 02:14:13.740
And as bad as everybody says it is dude.
Yeah.

2242
02:14:13.741 --> 02:14:17.640
You ever see that Schmidt pain index?
Yes.
The Schmidt pain index,

2243
02:14:17.700 --> 02:14:22.700
he scores all insect bites and the bull ants,

2244
02:14:23.431 --> 02:14:27.630
the only one that gets a four plus rating like a five star hotel.

2245
02:14:27.930 --> 02:14:32.490
It's the highest rated.
There's,
he has found.
And he's uh,
he studies,
you know,

2246
02:14:32.491 --> 02:14:36.240
insect toxins and insect stings.
He's found nothing else.

2247
02:14:36.241 --> 02:14:38.370
It's as painful to was,
it feels like,

2248
02:14:39.060 --> 02:14:43.170
it feels at first like you got zapped by a wasp and Hornet.

2249
02:14:44.910 --> 02:14:48.750
Um,
and maybe 10 minutes into it,

2250
02:14:50.040 --> 02:14:53.130
a minute into it,
it becomes something very different than that.

2251
02:14:53.760 --> 02:14:56.670
10 minutes into it you feel like something's really wrong,

2252
02:14:58.020 --> 02:15:02.460
like arthritic pain,
throbbing,

2253
02:15:02.461 --> 02:15:05.490
throbbing pain that goes way away from the source and we couldn't speak and

2254
02:15:05.491 --> 02:15:10.491
we're out in the jungle at night and first they go and find a vine and pulp up

2255
02:15:10.800 --> 02:15:14.700
some of the vine and put the vine.
And where I got hit,

2256
02:15:15.090 --> 02:15:16.200
I don't know what the Viola had,

2257
02:15:16.440 --> 02:15:18.930
I couldn't tell that it had any difference than mean anything different.

2258
02:15:19.500 --> 02:15:23.070
But I was bit on my ankle and one of the camera guy,

2259
02:15:23.071 --> 02:15:25.740
Phil buried but was bid out in hand at the same time.

2260
02:15:26.550 --> 02:15:30.900
And he kept pointing to Phil's hand,

2261
02:15:31.560 --> 02:15:33.180
but then running his finger,

2262
02:15:34.200 --> 02:15:37.530
the Chimani guys pointing to Phil's hand and running his finger up his arm,

2263
02:15:37.531 --> 02:15:38.364
like to his heart.

2264
02:15:39.070 --> 02:15:42.900
He keeps doing that to Phil and he keeps taking me and pointed his finger to his

2265
02:15:42.901 --> 02:15:46.530
ankle and then a running his finger up the inside of his leg to his groin.

2266
02:15:47.160 --> 02:15:50.310
And I thought that means that the top poison or toxin or somehow it's going to

2267
02:15:50.311 --> 02:15:51.510
travel up and get you.

2268
02:15:51.870 --> 02:15:55.440
I couldn't tell what he was talking about and all I knew was as bad to get bit

2269
02:15:55.441 --> 02:15:59.460
by a bullet ant prison.
So back when even we weren't even able to walk,

2270
02:15:59.490 --> 02:16:03.000
I wasn't on that walk.
I just had to lay there and just like rive,

2271
02:16:03.580 --> 02:16:04.413
you know how long,

2272
02:16:05.600 --> 02:16:08.580
well I'll tell you this an hour and 45 minutes later I couldn't remember what

2273
02:16:08.581 --> 02:16:11.250
the hell ankle,
it was really no mark,

2274
02:16:11.700 --> 02:16:15.510
no mark and you couldn't figure out which ankle I was walking under.

2275
02:16:15.511 --> 02:16:20.280
Two hours later I remember thinking like I've ever realized that I couldn't

2276
02:16:20.281 --> 02:16:21.660
think of what ankle it had been on.

2277
02:16:21.720 --> 02:16:24.540
Do you think that's because the medication that they use because of the plants?

2278
02:16:24.541 --> 02:16:26.520
I've read that from a lot of other people really?

2279
02:16:27.210 --> 02:16:31.580
Well I thought it lasted for like 24 hours
for me.

2280
02:16:31.640 --> 02:16:33.500
Now they do a thing where they take like a,

2281
02:16:33.560 --> 02:16:37.400
some kind of Mitt and fill it full of them and you put the mid on,

2282
02:16:37.401 --> 02:16:41.120
it's like an initiation and you get bid a lot and then it's a whole,

2283
02:16:41.121 --> 02:16:45.590
I guess it's a whole other world,
but for me,
I think that was,
I could be wrong.

2284
02:16:46.540 --> 02:16:51.470
No,
I don't think I am man.
I think that it was,
the peak was 30,

2285
02:16:51.471 --> 02:16:52.610
40 minutes into it.

2286
02:16:53.910 --> 02:16:54.510
<v 5>Okay.</v>

2287
02:16:54.510 --> 02:16:58.890
<v 2>Um,
and in then it just taper,
taper,
taper and then gone.</v>

2288
02:16:59.910 --> 02:17:03.660
Now if I got hit by one now,
knowing what I know now,

2289
02:17:04.860 --> 02:17:08.070
I don't want to say that I would enjoy it,
but I would be more interested.

2290
02:17:08.190 --> 02:17:11.640
I would be interested in what was going on and watching the progression.

2291
02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:13.920
But I was so scared because I didn't know what it meant.

2292
02:17:13.950 --> 02:17:16.480
I didn't know if it was like getting hit by a rattlesnake right.

2293
02:17:16.560 --> 02:17:20.760
Where you need to go and figure shit out or what.

2294
02:17:21.060 --> 02:17:24.500
And they weren't able to tell me
what was

2295
02:17:26.420 --> 02:17:28.170
weird.
Yeah.
What I later learned,

2296
02:17:28.350 --> 02:17:33.060
what they were saying was make sure that you don't have any in your sleeves and

2297
02:17:33.061 --> 02:17:36.720
make sure you don't have any,
because they'll come up and get you on the chest,

2298
02:17:36.721 --> 02:17:39.990
which might be bad or don't get you on the balls,
which is bad.
Oh yeah,

2299
02:17:39.991 --> 02:17:43.590
I would imagine so.
He's saying like,
not that it's traveling up to,

2300
02:17:43.591 --> 02:17:46.310
you're not that it's traveling up to your grind,
but that ain't,

2301
02:17:46.350 --> 02:17:49.230
don't let it get up your pants and get you the Schmidt.
Oh,

2302
02:17:49.231 --> 02:17:53.940
there's the Schmidt pain index.
300 Mil Lens.
300 minutes.

2303
02:17:54.300 --> 02:17:55.620
300 minutes.
Okay.

2304
02:17:56.780 --> 02:17:57.613
<v 5>Wow.</v>

2305
02:17:58.660 --> 02:18:02.050
<v 3>But he's really soup that index up.
Recently I got,</v>

2306
02:18:02.410 --> 02:18:07.410
I got stung by a wasp recently in Colorado and it was the most fucking painful

2307
02:18:08.681 --> 02:18:12.700
staying I've ever felt in my life.
And I don't know what happened.

2308
02:18:12.701 --> 02:18:16.120
I was walking and then all of a sudden I go,
ah,

2309
02:18:16.150 --> 02:18:20.890
like it was like unusual.
It didn't make any sense.
I was like,
what the fuck?

2310
02:18:20.891 --> 02:18:24.210
Just bit me.
Like I've been stung by bees before.
Yeah,
I don't,

2311
02:18:24.250 --> 02:18:28.000
I think I've been stung by Hornets.
I,
I think it was a wasp,

2312
02:18:28.060 --> 02:18:29.310
it was a wasp or a hornet.

2313
02:18:29.420 --> 02:18:33.550
I didn't even see what the bug was because it was going through this heavy Bush

2314
02:18:33.970 --> 02:18:37.960
and,
uh,
my fucking arm swollen,
like Popeye,
it was so weird.

2315
02:18:38.230 --> 02:18:42.370
Like it was hard,
like the bottom of my forum turned right.

2316
02:18:42.450 --> 02:18:42.781
<v 2>Bam.</v>

2317
02:18:42.781 --> 02:18:46.230
Got Hit by something like that down in Virginia that the next day turned into a

2318
02:18:46.231 --> 02:18:49.370
big hard knob.
Like he had like a softball stuck unders.

2319
02:18:49.490 --> 02:18:54.380
<v 3>Yeah.
And it lasted for like five or six days and it was,
it was so itchy.</v>

2320
02:18:54.381 --> 02:18:58.750
Like I had to do everything I could to keep from clawing my arm apart where I

2321
02:18:58.760 --> 02:19:02.810
would go under the shower and I turned the shower up really hot to the point

2322
02:19:02.811 --> 02:19:06.950
where it'd be painful with any other part of my body and just shove that arm

2323
02:19:07.190 --> 02:19:08.720
underneath the super hot water.

2324
02:19:08.721 --> 02:19:12.880
Like it was scratching it with this insanely hot water.
Yeah.

2325
02:19:12.960 --> 02:19:15.800
It was burning my arm.
But,
uh,

2326
02:19:15.830 --> 02:19:19.640
nothing like a bullet that I got hit by a lionfish.
Oh.

2327
02:19:19.641 --> 02:19:21.390
I've seen those things in that,

2328
02:19:21.800 --> 02:19:23.780
<v 2>um,
again,</v>

2329
02:19:23.810 --> 02:19:25.910
scare the shit out of me because I didn't really know what all it meant.

2330
02:19:25.940 --> 02:19:30.590
We were spearfishing and I hit by a lion fish and the thing you do is you heat

2331
02:19:30.591 --> 02:19:31.424
water up

2332
02:19:32.400 --> 02:19:33.210
<v 5>yeah.</v>

2333
02:19:33.210 --> 02:19:36.840
<v 2>To boiling and let it cool.</v>

2334
02:19:36.841 --> 02:19:41.100
And the minute you can even kind of stand to put your,
watch your hand in there,

2335
02:19:42.260 --> 02:19:45.860
you dip your hand in there and it takes the pain away.
Wow.

2336
02:19:47.750 --> 02:19:51.530
That wasn't,
that wasn't their thing.
It's just like my hand swelled up like,
like,

2337
02:19:52.030 --> 02:19:56.240
like not really usable like an old Mickey mouse hand for how long?

2338
02:19:56.640 --> 02:20:00.080
A couple hours again.
We were out.
I had gone down,

2339
02:20:00.110 --> 02:20:05.110
we were spear fishing in The Bahamas and I had gone down and a shot a lion fish

2340
02:20:08.570 --> 02:20:12.950
cause they're good to eat.
Um,
I mean we were doing like [inaudible],

2341
02:20:13.160 --> 02:20:16.220
they're very good,
really white flesh yet you gotta be real careful with them.

2342
02:20:16.820 --> 02:20:21.440
I'd gone down and shot a lion fish.
What's that?
Hey,
careful house.

2343
02:20:21.441 --> 02:20:24.980
So you have to avoid the status of what we would do is when you get a lion fish,

2344
02:20:24.981 --> 02:20:29.981
we'd take the lionfish and leave it on the spear and an open cooler up and stick

2345
02:20:30.501 --> 02:20:35.090
the spear and lionfish into the cooler and shut the lid and Paul so that your

2346
02:20:35.091 --> 02:20:38.780
spirit would come out and the lion fish would fall into the coop.
Now lionfish,

2347
02:20:38.781 --> 02:20:42.930
just uh,
for your listeners,
it's a,
it's a non native that,
uh,

2348
02:20:42.970 --> 02:20:47.970
has been introduced into the Caribbean is wreaking much habit from Florida

2349
02:20:48.110 --> 02:20:52.280
southward and they're there.
They're doing a lot to try to get rid of him.

2350
02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:53.301
You see,

2351
02:20:53.301 --> 02:20:56.870
waxes are so viciously territorial and out there in The Bahamas you have these

2352
02:20:56.871 --> 02:21:00.290
small little coral heads and a couple of lionfish and move in there and they

2353
02:21:00.291 --> 02:21:03.950
would just move out other fish.
So there's no regulations on line,

2354
02:21:03.980 --> 02:21:05.960
but you're allowed to kill as many as you want.
They encourage you to kill.

2355
02:21:05.961 --> 02:21:09.090
The manager wants to,
will the people let them loose from acquiring them?
Yeah,

2356
02:21:09.130 --> 02:21:12.920
I think it's somehow they escaped through the aquarium trade as an aquarium.

2357
02:21:12.950 --> 02:21:15.950
Yeah.
Man,
I can't,
I don't want to say for sure.
Maybe you're a,

2358
02:21:15.951 --> 02:21:19.730
you're a internet whiz over here.
Jamie will bill tell you the answer to that,

2359
02:21:19.760 --> 02:21:23.030
but uh,
how they,
how they got in the first place.
But anyhow,

2360
02:21:24.440 --> 02:21:27.890
then later would take poultry shears and just get big rubber gloves,

2361
02:21:27.891 --> 02:21:32.840
wants to fish is dead and take poultry shears and cut all the thorns off it.

2362
02:21:33.560 --> 02:21:37.670
Then fly it.
So the thorns are where the toxins stored,
not in the glands.

2363
02:21:38.090 --> 02:21:42.110
They got injected in you with the,
with the,
with the thorns.
These are the spines,

2364
02:21:42.111 --> 02:21:43.670
you know?
Right.
And these spines,

2365
02:21:43.700 --> 02:21:48.290
is the toxin in the spine itself or is there a Glam on a Nathan on it?

2366
02:21:48.470 --> 02:21:52.670
Yeah,
that's my understanding now.
I'd gone,

2367
02:21:52.730 --> 02:21:55.340
I ran out of breath and left my spear,

2368
02:21:56.840 --> 02:22:00.650
stuck in a lionfish down on the bottom,
came up,
got a breath,

2369
02:22:00.651 --> 02:22:05.150
went down and as I'm trying to get my lion fish out of this air using without

2370
02:22:05.151 --> 02:22:08.060
pulling him off spearhead,
notice the grouper and in a hole.

2371
02:22:09.040 --> 02:22:14.040
So I went up and I got a lion fish on my spear and I'm waving to my brother to

2372
02:22:14.841 --> 02:22:17.150
come over because I don't want,
I can't take the lion fish off my spirit.

2373
02:22:17.151 --> 02:22:20.610
I'm wavering him to come over about the grouper and he comes over and he's got a

2374
02:22:20.611 --> 02:22:22.430
snap or on the end of his spear.

2375
02:22:22.820 --> 02:22:26.490
So I take the snap or off his spear and I'm holding

2376
02:22:26.520 --> 02:22:31.520
<v 4>the damn snapper in my right hand and I have a lion fish on my spear and my left</v>

2377
02:22:32.071 --> 02:22:36.660
hand and I'm going under water trying to point to the hole that has the group

2378
02:22:36.661 --> 02:22:41.661
are in it and somehow swung that lionfish into my hand and it got all weird and

2379
02:22:42.661 --> 02:22:46.500
puffy and I crawled up into the boat and it was just kinda like riding in the

2380
02:22:46.501 --> 02:22:49.790
bottom of the boat.
And I started getting really scared because my hand started,

2381
02:22:49.800 --> 02:22:52.360
feel hot and all bloated.
And uh,

2382
02:22:53.640 --> 02:22:57.120
eventually wave my brother and our buddy Eric over.

2383
02:22:57.510 --> 02:23:00.060
And we went in and we were at 45 minutes from the shore and went in.

2384
02:23:00.061 --> 02:23:01.590
And by then I was really scared.

2385
02:23:01.800 --> 02:23:05.160
And my buddy Ronnie Bain was there and he's like saying I should put it under

2386
02:23:05.161 --> 02:23:07.710
cold water.
And I went and typed in the internet.
It's like,

2387
02:23:07.711 --> 02:23:09.040
do not put it in cold water

2388
02:23:12.600 --> 02:23:14.500
through the,
it was so

2389
02:23:14.630 --> 02:23:17.200
<v 3>[inaudible] you have here it goes speculated,</v>

2390
02:23:17.201 --> 02:23:21.010
the root of the problem was only six lionfish accidentally released from an

2391
02:23:21.020 --> 02:23:25.000
acquirement aquarium during the hurricane Andrew in 1992.

2392
02:23:25.390 --> 02:23:30.340
Wow.
That's crazy.
Genetic research supports this finger pointing,

2393
02:23:30.610 --> 02:23:34.600
but it's likely many more have been intentionally released by retired aquarium

2394
02:23:34.601 --> 02:23:37.390
enthusiasts.
We're tired.
Aquarium enthusiasts.

2395
02:23:37.690 --> 02:23:38.800
That's a funny way of looking at it.

2396
02:23:39.040 --> 02:23:42.310
But Florida has a gigantic issue with invasive species mean it comes from

2397
02:23:42.311 --> 02:23:45.160
aquarium.
It's amazing.
Oh there it's pythons are,
you know,

2398
02:23:45.161 --> 02:23:49.150
they found Nial crocs in the town.
Yeah,
Dave.
Uh,

2399
02:23:49.151 --> 02:23:53.890
there was a reading a whole article how they have just to kill onsite for Nial

2400
02:23:53.891 --> 02:23:55.150
crocs.
They're just terrified.

2401
02:23:55.151 --> 02:23:59.020
These fucking giant Crocs gonna grow to be these 28 foot long killers like they

2402
02:23:59.021 --> 02:24:01.210
have in Mozambique or wherever the fuck it is.

2403
02:24:01.430 --> 02:24:06.140
<v 4>Florida is the Florida is the future of wilderness.</v>

2404
02:24:06.830 --> 02:24:07.663
How so?

2405
02:24:07.850 --> 02:24:12.580
Because as we move species around

2406
02:24:14.930 --> 02:24:16.340
with reckless abandon,

2407
02:24:17.260 --> 02:24:18.093
<v 5>mmm.</v>

2408
02:24:19.340 --> 02:24:21.650
<v 4>Intentionally or unintentionally,</v>

2409
02:24:23.360 --> 02:24:28.360
and we eliminate biodiversity in some areas to habitat destruction.

2410
02:24:30.860 --> 02:24:33.620
And if current trends continue in,

2411
02:24:33.621 --> 02:24:38.621
the earth continues to get hotter and we lose a lot of the climatic diversity,

2412
02:24:39.620 --> 02:24:43.670
different climates that we have different places.
If that continues,
um,

2413
02:24:43.850 --> 02:24:48.500
I think that you will have,
we'll continue to see like the great mixing,

2414
02:24:49.760 --> 02:24:50.930
you know,
uh,

2415
02:24:50.931 --> 02:24:54.380
and you and we'll just wind up with a situation where there are certain,

2416
02:24:55.520 --> 02:25:00.110
every animal is going to get a shot at every biome and you're just going to have

2417
02:25:00.111 --> 02:25:05.111
it be that certain ones that can thrive are going to thrive and you're not going

2418
02:25:05.261 --> 02:25:09.850
to have the levels of endemism that we have now.
And I think that,
yeah,

2419
02:25:09.890 --> 02:25:12.140
in the future,
you know,

2420
02:25:12.320 --> 02:25:17.030
just look at what the wild pig has managed to do here in the u s you know,

2421
02:25:17.270 --> 02:25:21.920
it's the dominant large animal on some landscapes.
So it's a non native,

2422
02:25:22.400 --> 02:25:26.590
um,
the,
in my lifetime,
in the Great Lakes,

2423
02:25:26.591 --> 02:25:30.010
the round gobys zebra muscles,

2424
02:25:30.700 --> 02:25:34.540
if you go now and drop a baited hook down in places that I grew up fishing,

2425
02:25:34.541 --> 02:25:37.480
the first thing you would pull up as a Gobi,
they were not there.

2426
02:25:38.530 --> 02:25:41.170
It just certain things are winners and certain things are losers.

2427
02:25:41.650 --> 02:25:46.650
Not all the winners are going to be non natives because whitetail deer do well

2428
02:25:47.921 --> 02:25:51.220
around people.
Crows seem to do well around people.

2429
02:25:51.221 --> 02:25:54.310
Canada geese do very well around people.
It just got to be that.

2430
02:25:54.311 --> 02:25:57.730
It's just going to be more and more and more aquarium.

2431
02:25:57.731 --> 02:26:00.180
Like isn't it weird how

2432
02:26:00.370 --> 02:26:05.140
<v 3>people have this desire to manipulate and manage all the other wildlife?</v>

2433
02:26:05.370 --> 02:26:09.220
I mean it is strange when you think about the evidence points to the contrary.

2434
02:26:09.221 --> 02:26:12.910
The evidence points to,
I mean there,
there are like,
like you said,

2435
02:26:13.210 --> 02:26:16.750
more whitetail deer in the United States now that when Columbus landed,

2436
02:26:16.751 --> 02:26:18.090
so they've done a great job and,

2437
02:26:18.091 --> 02:26:21.160
and bringing back healthy populations to certain animals.

2438
02:26:21.430 --> 02:26:24.550
But then he seemed like the shit they've done in Florida where the pythons are

2439
02:26:24.551 --> 02:26:28.480
fucking eating alligators.
I mean if you,
you've seen that image of them,

2440
02:26:28.540 --> 02:26:33.430
that's a famous image that is a crazy image of 20 foot long python,

2441
02:26:33.431 --> 02:26:34.780
that eight a fucking alligator.

2442
02:26:35.140 --> 02:26:40.140
I mean they have this crazy system going on down there where these non

2443
02:26:40.390 --> 02:26:44.670
indigenous animals are just crushing all these other animals and,

2444
02:26:44.671 --> 02:26:49.671
and surviving and thriving in an environment that's pretty compatible for them.

2445
02:26:50.120 --> 02:26:54.790
You know,
as far as you know,
tropical hot climate,
moist,

2446
02:26:54.850 --> 02:26:58.600
plenty of things to eat,
plenty of life out there for them to snuff out

2447
02:26:58.840 --> 02:27:02.300
<v 4>in some areas.
They're finding a friend of mine,
Robert Abernathy,</v>

2448
02:27:02.301 --> 02:27:06.620
who was a biologist and in conservationist,
big hunter,
he,
uh,

2449
02:27:07.370 --> 02:27:10.790
he was working with some guys that are going down there and there's a whole

2450
02:27:11.120 --> 02:27:16.120
class of mid size animal that's just missing from those python areas now.

2451
02:27:17.560 --> 02:27:19.550
Whoa.
Based like Possum,

2452
02:27:19.551 --> 02:27:23.570
raccoon sized critters are just gone.

2453
02:27:24.860 --> 02:27:26.340
You know,
you will see like,

2454
02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:31.700
that's why I was bring us full circle back to some things we were talking about.

2455
02:27:31.730 --> 02:27:35.670
A lot of the conservation groups that I get involved in.
Um,

2456
02:27:36.770 --> 02:27:40.010
things like,
you know,
National Wild Turkey Federation,

2457
02:27:40.011 --> 02:27:42.850
Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation,
um,

2458
02:27:44.240 --> 02:27:46.730
they pick,
you know,
they're,

2459
02:27:46.731 --> 02:27:50.990
they're powered by hunters and powered by hunter money in the,

2460
02:27:51.050 --> 02:27:55.010
in the effort to preserve habitat for certain species.

2461
02:27:55.850 --> 02:28:00.850
But like native animals that wind up by helping knows,

2462
02:28:00.861 --> 02:28:05.750
you know,
you're helping all other creatures because you can't fix out.

2463
02:28:05.780 --> 02:28:09.170
Like if you fix elk habitat,
you're fixing everyone's habitat.
You know,

2464
02:28:09.171 --> 02:28:10.700
it's like a keystone thing.
You,

2465
02:28:10.720 --> 02:28:14.990
if you help elk by salvaging riparian areas,

2466
02:28:15.020 --> 02:28:17.630
you're helping all creditors across the board.
You know,

2467
02:28:17.631 --> 02:28:21.930
you're in enhancing wildlife and a big that you have.

2468
02:28:21.931 --> 02:28:25.040
And then if you look at native wildlife and you cherish native wildlife,

2469
02:28:25.041 --> 02:28:27.930
and I do one of the big risks we have coming down lines,

2470
02:28:27.990 --> 02:28:32.210
just the non native stuff,
you know,
I mean as far as even just vegetation,

2471
02:28:32.750 --> 02:28:37.000
we have a lot of areas that we're seeing the,

2472
02:28:37.090 --> 02:28:42.090
those high quality plants being displaced by plants that make native wildlife

2473
02:28:42.591 --> 02:28:46.310
sick that they can't live on.
It's a big,

2474
02:28:46.460 --> 02:28:48.470
big problem in a and in,
in some ways.

2475
02:28:48.471 --> 02:28:52.400
You want to look at Florida and it's almost like the wildlife situation in

2476
02:28:52.401 --> 02:28:56.690
Florida is almost kind of become a joke where it's so outlandish.

2477
02:28:56.760 --> 02:29:00.800
It's like this like Jurassic Park Environment.
Yeah.
But same time it's also,

2478
02:29:00.801 --> 02:29:05.150
you look at it like God,
you know,
it's like this wild place and it's,
you know,

2479
02:29:05.151 --> 02:29:06.590
it's the new wilderness in some ways,

2480
02:29:06.591 --> 02:29:10.940
but in some ways just like it's really sad what that's gonna mean for the

2481
02:29:10.941 --> 02:29:12.280
endemics.
Well,

2482
02:29:12.360 --> 02:29:15.400
<v 1>Florida sort of attracts that even with human beings though.</v>

2483
02:29:15.790 --> 02:29:20.490
I mean those are non native human beings that went down there and took over too.

2484
02:29:20.790 --> 02:29:23.160
It's all people that escaped from the mob,

2485
02:29:23.161 --> 02:29:28.161
from New York and weird people from Cuba that came up and rabbits of like Carl

2486
02:29:28.830 --> 02:29:32.880
Hiaasen man.
And then the cocaine thing.
That's also a non native plant.
It's,

2487
02:29:32.910 --> 02:29:33.211
you know,

2488
02:29:33.211 --> 02:29:38.100
it's main biproduct introduced to that area that changed the entire ecosystem

2489
02:29:38.250 --> 02:29:41.700
financially.
You know,
there's more banks per capita in Miami,

2490
02:29:41.701 --> 02:29:43.140
then there are the rest of the country.

2491
02:29:43.440 --> 02:29:46.110
And the reason being is because that's where they fucking laundered money.

2492
02:29:46.380 --> 02:29:49.240
I mean,
it's really clear.
I grew up with just tremendous

2493
02:29:49.350 --> 02:29:53.930
<v 4>Findlay for Florida because in Michigan that's in my area,</v>

2494
02:29:53.980 --> 02:29:54.550
Michigan,

2495
02:29:54.550 --> 02:29:57.850
<v 1>like when you went on vacation,
you went to Florida just like you didn't go.</v>

2496
02:29:57.851 --> 02:30:02.000
It was just where you want a place to vacation.
Yeah.
But now we're like,
man,

2497
02:30:02.001 --> 02:30:05.620
all other parts of the country,
people are like,
you went where?
I'm like,
yeah man,

2498
02:30:05.621 --> 02:30:09.410
Florida.
Why like cousins Florida?
Man,
it's amazing.
You know?

2499
02:30:09.411 --> 02:30:12.250
It was a great fishing,
but a lot of people.
But yeah,
it's just like we

2500
02:30:13.490 --> 02:30:18.490
<v 4>so strongly with Florida and the fishing in Florida that I do,</v>

2501
02:30:18.781 --> 02:30:21.930
I have a soft spot and I was down there and I was talking to this kid who likes

2502
02:30:21.931 --> 02:30:23.190
to hunt down there not long ago.

2503
02:30:23.191 --> 02:30:26.010
And he was telling me this is the hunting and fishing capital of the world,

2504
02:30:26.370 --> 02:30:31.170
Florida.
Yeah.
Well they have a lot of game down there.
He was,

2505
02:30:31.420 --> 02:30:32.520
he was a wild pig owner.

2506
02:30:32.660 --> 02:30:34.350
<v 1>Lot of wild pigs,
right?
Yup.</v>

2507
02:30:34.760 --> 02:30:38.240
Isn't that where you shot the wild pig with the Bryant Gumbel in that episode?

2508
02:30:38.990 --> 02:30:41.570
Yeah,
it Florida's a nutty spot.
And you know,

2509
02:30:41.571 --> 02:30:44.760
they're saying that it's not even going to be there if the water rises the way

2510
02:30:44.761 --> 02:30:49.040
it's rising right now,
they're thinking Miami won't even exist in 30 or 40 years.

2511
02:30:49.220 --> 02:30:53.500
That because it's all like very porous,
porous limestone.
Yeah.
That the is just,

2512
02:30:53.510 --> 02:30:56.000
it's not going to be like New Orleans where they get damn it up.
It's like,

2513
02:30:56.001 --> 02:30:59.030
it's just going to come right through the ground and that's going to be a wrap.

2514
02:30:59.690 --> 02:31:02.660
<v 4>It's going to be more,
uh,
there's a thing I like to fish called flats.</v>

2515
02:31:03.790 --> 02:31:04.850
It's going to be a lot more flat.

2516
02:31:06.550 --> 02:31:08.440
<v 1>You get to be flat near the Miami Needy,</v>

2517
02:31:09.020 --> 02:31:12.950
needy water has trained you to be like a lot of red fish or taking a fucking

2518
02:31:13.040 --> 02:31:17.660
boat ride for fish around the Miami hotel.
What time is your flight?

2519
02:31:17.750 --> 02:31:20.220
But telling me I gotta get,
I gotta get going right now.

2520
02:31:20.660 --> 02:31:23.700
<v 2>Oh,
I got it.
I think that he was saying that'd be stupid.
Leave after three 30.</v>

2521
02:31:23.820 --> 02:31:28.100
Okay,
well it's three 13.
Don't be stupid.
We'll get you,

2522
02:31:28.170 --> 02:31:31.830
get you out of here in a few minutes.
Um,
what else did I want to ask you about?

2523
02:31:32.130 --> 02:31:33.480
Oh the,
the,

2524
02:31:33.510 --> 02:31:36.600
one of the things about Bolivia that I found fascinating was that the people

2525
02:31:36.601 --> 02:31:39.600
seem to have adapted physically to that environment.

2526
02:31:39.990 --> 02:31:43.260
Like you were saying that you were traveling with those people and they didn't

2527
02:31:43.261 --> 02:31:47.580
sweat.
Yeah.
Like you're sweating like crazy.
It's porn on your pores.

2528
02:31:47.610 --> 02:31:50.290
We would go out at night and uh,

2529
02:31:51.600 --> 02:31:55.670
well first off these guys chew a coca leaves.
Ah Rich.

2530
02:31:55.680 --> 02:31:59.160
We all got into big time.
I could ever tell what it's actually doing it,
you know,

2531
02:31:59.161 --> 02:32:00.720
it's like it's what they make cocaine from it.

2532
02:32:00.721 --> 02:32:04.480
They take the coca leaf and they put a lime on it.

2533
02:32:05.040 --> 02:32:07.890
It was a liar.
No baking soda that's they put on their lives.

2534
02:32:07.950 --> 02:32:09.560
That's what they use of that Betel nut.
No,

2535
02:32:09.570 --> 02:32:13.290
they take a leaf and you pack your cheek.

2536
02:32:13.830 --> 02:32:15.450
They call it bowl a ball.

2537
02:32:15.930 --> 02:32:19.310
I mean to the point where your cheek looks seriously puffed out and flame what

2538
02:32:19.320 --> 02:32:22.890
full of leaves and then you put baking soda in there cause it's somehow

2539
02:32:22.891 --> 02:32:26.760
activates the alkaloids and is supposed to give you a boost and keep you going.

2540
02:32:26.761 --> 02:32:27.594
At night.

2541
02:32:28.110 --> 02:32:32.380
So I'd be out there and I have a couple of water bottles and I just be slam

2542
02:32:32.381 --> 02:32:34.830
water and just pouring sweat and I'm not like a sweaty dude,

2543
02:32:34.860 --> 02:32:38.160
but I'd be sweating so bad out in the jungle drinking all this water and these

2544
02:32:38.161 --> 02:32:41.880
guys each got a bag.
They were these little shoulder,

2545
02:32:42.010 --> 02:32:46.490
it looks almost like a woman's purse but it's like a handmade bag they carry and

2546
02:32:46.500 --> 02:32:49.320
it would have kitchen knife in it like a paring knife,

2547
02:32:49.321 --> 02:32:50.071
which should be their hunting.
I,

2548
02:32:50.071 --> 02:32:51.720
I've or they just have that in their back pocket.

2549
02:32:52.440 --> 02:32:55.950
They don't wear shoes that had that bag.
They don't want to shoot.
Yeah.

2550
02:32:55.951 --> 02:32:58.650
You know what one of the guys put shoes on,

2551
02:32:58.651 --> 02:33:02.520
we're going out and he couldn't get to him cause he never wore shoes but he

2552
02:33:02.521 --> 02:33:05.580
wanted to try them out.
They go out barefoot so,

2553
02:33:05.880 --> 02:33:08.970
and they got this leave their cocoa leaves,

2554
02:33:09.330 --> 02:33:14.330
they got a bag of baking soda and then they had this like one of these water

2555
02:33:14.731 --> 02:33:18.630
bottles and I thought that they were somehow able to get through all night,

2556
02:33:19.710 --> 02:33:24.120
two of them with one water bottle of water.
And I was impressed by that.

2557
02:33:24.180 --> 02:33:27.030
But later someone told me it's a,
it's the distilled spirit.

2558
02:33:28.980 --> 02:33:30.720
So it's not even water.
No,
it's like vodka,

2559
02:33:30.960 --> 02:33:35.400
but not so the drinking vodka and hydrate.
Yeah.
Chewing cocoa leaves.

2560
02:33:35.610 --> 02:33:39.480
Drinking.
It's not vodka,
but it's like a,
it's like a rice.
It's like a,
like,
uh,

2561
02:33:39.510 --> 02:33:42.090
some kind of thing.
Like you take rice,
wine and some out to steal it.

2562
02:33:42.120 --> 02:33:46.140
I don't understand how they did it.
Wow.
The guys I was with,

2563
02:33:46.141 --> 02:33:50.560
remember what it was and he goes real strong and uh,
like a moonshine almost.

2564
02:33:50.580 --> 02:33:54.270
Yeah.
And they would be out there with a mouth pack full of coca leaves,

2565
02:33:54.390 --> 02:33:56.730
sticking baking soda in there,
drinking and stuff.

2566
02:33:56.731 --> 02:34:00.870
I have a water bottle and they wouldn't drink water all night.
Wow.
I was dying.

2567
02:34:01.530 --> 02:34:03.560
Yeah.
They're accustomed to it.
But here's the thing,

2568
02:34:03.780 --> 02:34:07.410
when you want to get into that,
if you took those boys,

2569
02:34:07.560 --> 02:34:11.530
because they've never experienced,
they've never experienced it.

2570
02:34:11.531 --> 02:34:16.070
It's a temperature below 40 degrees Fahrenheit,
you know,

2571
02:34:16.820 --> 02:34:18.310
in life.
Right.

2572
02:34:18.670 --> 02:34:22.600
So if you took those boys and I was like,
hey man,

2573
02:34:22.601 --> 02:34:27.130
we're going to go hunt in the Arctic for Caribou and is going to be snow on the

2574
02:34:27.131 --> 02:34:30.730
ground,
you know,
um,

2575
02:34:31.120 --> 02:34:35.890
they would go home and talk about how we are some kind of superman.

2576
02:34:36.210 --> 02:34:40.000
He rose
sleeping out in the snow,

2577
02:34:41.290 --> 02:34:44.110
you know,
blow their mind,
what have you,

2578
02:34:44.111 --> 02:34:46.930
took them to new Novak and they'd blow their mind.
Took him to that.

2579
02:34:46.931 --> 02:34:49.660
You just get really like you get set in year.

2580
02:34:50.140 --> 02:34:54.250
Remember how everybody always likes to make that big deal about how in the,

2581
02:34:54.280 --> 02:34:58.330
like in the NC Witt language,
they have like 24 words for snow.

2582
02:34:58.920 --> 02:34:59.470
All right.

2583
02:34:59.470 --> 02:35:03.310
I just don't think that we have a difficult time describing people who liked to

2584
02:35:03.311 --> 02:35:07.210
ski,
have many ways of describing snow.

2585
02:35:07.570 --> 02:35:12.250
It's kind of a,
it's like a little bit is it's almost dishonest.
So we have like,

2586
02:35:12.520 --> 02:35:16.300
yeah,
we have like light powder,
heavy powder,
slushy snow,

2587
02:35:17.110 --> 02:35:18.250
you know,
on and on and on.

2588
02:35:18.251 --> 02:35:23.251
Like we have ways of describing snow and it's easy to sort of mythologize um,

2589
02:35:25.210 --> 02:35:28.360
people or you go down,
you get the feeling that there's like these super,

2590
02:35:28.361 --> 02:35:32.050
I do that these superhuman beings,
but then,
you know,
I look at it,
she's like,

2591
02:35:32.200 --> 02:35:37.030
they're just used to a landscape that's baffling to me.
You know,

2592
02:35:37.270 --> 02:35:38.890
like,
look,
there's four of us out.

2593
02:35:39.070 --> 02:35:42.070
Two of US got hit by a bullet ants who got hit by bullet ants,

2594
02:35:42.860 --> 02:35:45.280
me and the other white guy.
Right.

2595
02:35:45.310 --> 02:35:48.250
Those guys need to hit by a bullet and they're barefoot.
Yeah.
How they,

2596
02:35:48.251 --> 02:35:51.430
why did they not get hit by a bullet ant?
Because they walked through.

2597
02:35:51.490 --> 02:35:54.190
They just know the risks the same way.

2598
02:35:54.191 --> 02:35:59.110
If I took them and we were walking around somewhere in some urban environment,

2599
02:35:59.111 --> 02:35:59.950
they might not know one,

2600
02:35:59.951 --> 02:36:03.160
it's a good time to cross the street and walk off the other side.
The other one,

2601
02:36:03.250 --> 02:36:06.910
you know,
it was,
I'd be like,
what are you dumb?
But no,
he just doesn't know.

2602
02:36:07.090 --> 02:36:10.750
I don't know.
Like I wasn't tuned into the threat of bullet ants.

2603
02:36:11.470 --> 02:36:14.410
They would notice snakes that I didn't,
you know,
they would see a snake.

2604
02:36:14.411 --> 02:36:17.320
They noticed that I,
that I didn't notice.
They would always,
when it got to a log,

2605
02:36:17.321 --> 02:36:20.170
they would inspect the log very carefully.
If I had a bull ant on it,

2606
02:36:20.470 --> 02:36:23.680
they would kill it very delicately with the tip of a bow.

2607
02:36:24.430 --> 02:36:28.700
But they just had a way that they'd like to like press and kill the bullet ant

2608
02:36:28.701 --> 02:36:32.480
and like it's very like dainty fashion.
Um,
why is that?
I don't know.

2609
02:36:32.490 --> 02:36:33.370
I have to figure it out man.

2610
02:36:33.371 --> 02:36:35.770
They just had like a little way that they would crush bullet ants.

2611
02:36:35.771 --> 02:36:38.980
It was interesting with bullet ants go in these large groups or maybe they

2612
02:36:38.981 --> 02:36:42.100
didn't want to disturb it cause a pheromones would get all of their bullet ants

2613
02:36:42.101 --> 02:36:44.540
excited.
You know what I'm saying?
Like if you got a bunch of Hornets round,

2614
02:36:44.560 --> 02:36:46.180
you start flailing wildly.
I don't know.

2615
02:36:46.200 --> 02:36:47.410
I would just notice that they would do it.

2616
02:36:47.800 --> 02:36:50.470
They just walked through and they knew their area and yeah,

2617
02:36:50.471 --> 02:36:54.430
I was tempted to be like,
man,
these are like gods.
They're so aware.

2618
02:36:54.730 --> 02:36:59.440
But then I feel like had I been brought up there,
hanging out,

2619
02:36:59.980 --> 02:37:03.430
I might've not got hit by ball.
I got hit by bullet.
Well,

2620
02:37:03.431 --> 02:37:05.970
they probably all been hit right.
I asked them and they couldn't.

2621
02:37:05.980 --> 02:37:09.520
I later was able to ask them and one guy was saying he had probably been hit,

2622
02:37:09.521 --> 02:37:12.790
maybe.
I remember,
I thought he'd said somehow round nine times.

2623
02:37:13.180 --> 02:37:16.340
And another guy was saying he had no way of recollecting how many times you've

2624
02:37:16.341 --> 02:37:21.020
been hit by a bullet down.
Wow.
That's crazy that they walk around barefoot.
Yeah.

2625
02:37:22.010 --> 02:37:26.030
They do things barefoot.
That or what did their feet look like?

2626
02:37:26.150 --> 02:37:27.020
Not like yours.

2627
02:37:27.650 --> 02:37:30.950
Just flattened out and they got him down and get rid of your feet.
Get Real,

2628
02:37:30.951 --> 02:37:34.940
flattened out your toe,
your thumb toe,
let's say,

2629
02:37:35.360 --> 02:37:40.010
starts to move away.
Like a monkey starts to move away from your other toes.

2630
02:37:40.040 --> 02:37:43.640
I never seen anything so like it quite as much as I was in the Philippines,

2631
02:37:43.641 --> 02:37:47.960
in the highlands.
And,
uh,
the guys there,

2632
02:37:47.961 --> 02:37:51.860
they're there in the mountain like in serious mountains,
barefoot.
You know,

2633
02:37:51.861 --> 02:37:53.660
growing up,
hunting their whole lives in the mountains,

2634
02:37:53.661 --> 02:37:58.430
barefoot on just bad rock and everything all the time and their feet.

2635
02:37:58.640 --> 02:38:01.640
You wouldn't have been able to put that foot in the shoe.
No way now.
Wow.

2636
02:38:01.670 --> 02:38:03.770
Their tolls had there told her soul spread.

2637
02:38:03.800 --> 02:38:05.470
You can find pictures of that stuff online.

2638
02:38:05.480 --> 02:38:09.290
She was like kind of like a famous sort of thing that happens to those guys and

2639
02:38:09.291 --> 02:38:13.790
the s in the central highlands and Luzon island,
their feet are just incredible.

2640
02:38:14.240 --> 02:38:18.410
But I think it's just like your feet,
your toes are held,
you know,

2641
02:38:18.411 --> 02:38:23.240
inside your shoes.
Your totals are held in the way that they just,

2642
02:38:23.241 --> 02:38:25.940
if you're walking on a rock and in mountainous landscapes all the time,

2643
02:38:25.941 --> 02:38:30.890
your feet just fan out.
Wow.
You know,
like hands.
Yeah,
man.

2644
02:38:30.950 --> 02:38:34.310
Like creepy,
creepy.

2645
02:38:34.580 --> 02:38:38.870
I don't want to see creepy in a bad way,
but creepy to you.
When I was there,

2646
02:38:38.990 --> 02:38:40.760
I spent more time looking at people's feet.

2647
02:38:41.600 --> 02:38:44.450
Then I did their faces just to try to figure it out.

2648
02:38:44.451 --> 02:38:48.950
And some of these old guys had these tattoos that recounted when they used to

2649
02:38:48.980 --> 02:38:53.510
head hunt for the Japanese after World War II.
Guys were,
you know,

2650
02:38:53.540 --> 02:38:58.140
they were pretty hardcore fellows because after,
you know,
when,
um,

2651
02:38:58.400 --> 02:39:03.020
when they took the Philippines,
somebody that Japanese went up and just hit out,

2652
02:39:03.800 --> 02:39:06.740
you know,
and it would make a big sport out of fining them.
Wow.

2653
02:39:06.970 --> 02:39:08.480
Because the Americans wanted them,
you know,

2654
02:39:08.481 --> 02:39:10.430
and they'd get these tattoos that are exploits.

2655
02:39:10.431 --> 02:39:13.640
We met old people and they were introduced to us as such,

2656
02:39:13.641 --> 02:39:15.140
but who'd been headhunters,
you know,

2657
02:39:16.200 --> 02:39:21.200
and they would have their tail narrate it on their thing and they would,
uh,

2658
02:39:21.410 --> 02:39:24.470
go out in the jungle and they had these souped up air rifles and they'd go out

2659
02:39:24.471 --> 02:39:26.780
in the jungle and hot air rifles.
And then they had these,

2660
02:39:26.930 --> 02:39:29.790
you have here electro shocking for fish.
Yeah.

2661
02:39:30.200 --> 02:39:34.700
They would have homemade electro shocking kits would have a car battery in a
bag.

2662
02:39:34.730 --> 02:39:35.640
Like I have saw us.
Got,
it.

2663
02:39:35.650 --> 02:39:40.650
Had a big huge detergent bottle that you turned into a backpack.

2664
02:39:40.850 --> 02:39:43.940
And in that detergent bottle he had a stack of batteries.

2665
02:39:44.390 --> 02:39:49.390
And you had a negative into positive wand and he would stand out on rocks and

2666
02:39:49.971 --> 02:39:52.340
the river we were doing,
we were floating down a river it these guys,

2667
02:39:52.341 --> 02:39:55.940
he's standing on a rock and the river and put those under,

2668
02:39:55.941 --> 02:39:58.550
put those ones under rocks and under logs,

2669
02:39:58.670 --> 02:40:03.380
electro shock and fish and shrimp,
freshwater shrimp.

2670
02:40:03.560 --> 02:40:04.640
And how was he grounded?

2671
02:40:05.600 --> 02:40:08.010
You just stand on a rock and stick them in their same way when you're electro

2672
02:40:08.011 --> 02:40:11.270
fishing for anything going to survey and he would shock them up.

2673
02:40:11.271 --> 02:40:14.380
Then run down river with a net and net up all the stuff that he's shocked and

2674
02:40:14.381 --> 02:40:17.730
he'd get a log burning and roll the log over and lay the shrimp and crabs on the

2675
02:40:17.731 --> 02:40:20.250
log until they turn red and eat them.
Wow.

2676
02:40:20.310 --> 02:40:25.310
My brother was shocking fishing one time and got done shock and fish for a fish

2677
02:40:25.591 --> 02:40:30.591
survey was walking back from having shocked fish and he had the fish in a gunny

2678
02:40:31.141 --> 02:40:34.050
sack and a bolt of lightning came out of the sky,

2679
02:40:34.290 --> 02:40:38.100
hit the ground next to him and his shot of that electricity shot up into the

2680
02:40:38.101 --> 02:40:39.420
sack of fish and shocked him.

2681
02:40:40.930 --> 02:40:43.390
<v 1>Whoa.
I'd like to end on that because</v>

2682
02:40:45.820 --> 02:40:50.500
some kind of cosmic retribution.
Yeah,
I would imagine.
Holy Shit.

2683
02:40:50.620 --> 02:40:53.620
Well,
Remy got hit by lightening.
You know that story,
right?

2684
02:40:55.380 --> 02:40:57.620
<v 2>[inaudible] got some good stories.
He's got some really good story.</v>

2685
02:40:57.621 --> 02:41:00.770
He's got a story about that.
They were burning brush one time.

2686
02:41:01.100 --> 02:41:05.810
Someone burned a big brush pile and it was dry conditions and they burned a big

2687
02:41:05.811 --> 02:41:10.811
brush pile and all kinds of rodents started running out of the brush pile on

2688
02:41:11.961 --> 02:41:16.370
fire.
Starting little fires all over the place as they ran away.
Oh No,

2689
02:41:16.430 --> 02:41:18.860
it's a horrific story.
Oh my God.

2690
02:41:19.690 --> 02:41:24.620
<v 1>Let's,
I want to end on that.
Well,
listen,</v>

2691
02:41:24.621 --> 02:41:26.900
this book is fucking excellent.
Um,

2692
02:41:27.110 --> 02:41:31.250
the complete turn off the fade music.
Yes.
I forgot this thing.

2693
02:41:31.251 --> 02:41:34.070
I got to talk about seven more minutes.
Yeah.
This is important because,

2694
02:41:35.030 --> 02:41:39.290
<v 2>uh,
if you have Verizon files,</v>

2695
02:41:39.610 --> 02:41:43.690
<v 1>Oh yes.
All your listeners.
Yeah.
Verizon files is in some kind of,</v>

2696
02:41:44.580 --> 02:41:47.160
<v 2>there was some kind of piss and match.
I don't really understand it,</v>

2697
02:41:48.120 --> 02:41:51.810
but they've pulled for now they've pulled out door channel and sports from

2698
02:41:51.811 --> 02:41:53.640
channel off their lineup

2699
02:41:55.140 --> 02:41:55.973
<v 6>and uh,</v>

2700
02:41:56.760 --> 02:42:00.260
<v 2>they're suggesting that you go and watch that.</v>

2701
02:42:00.640 --> 02:42:05.250
They're like suggesting alternative content.
They're pointing people to like,

2702
02:42:05.280 --> 02:42:09.600
like,
like reality is shows that deal in hunting in some way.

2703
02:42:10.260 --> 02:42:11.610
It'd be like if you told people

2704
02:42:12.250 --> 02:42:13.083
<v 6>that</v>

2705
02:42:14.590 --> 02:42:17.380
<v 1>you know,
the,
you are not going to call the UFC anymore.</v>

2706
02:42:17.500 --> 02:42:21.930
Teenage mutant Ninja Turtle.
No.
Go Watch WWF.
Right.
It'd be like,
that's like

2707
02:42:23.190 --> 02:42:27.000
<v 2>if you have variety,
if you use Verizon in any way,
shape or form,</v>

2708
02:42:27.840 --> 02:42:32.170
do me a favor and a lot of it just do people a favor and um,

2709
02:42:32.520 --> 02:42:34.290
make sure to go and complain about that.

2710
02:42:34.910 --> 02:42:35.790
<v 1>And what is this?</v>

2711
02:42:36.480 --> 02:42:40.800
Because it's a contract contract dispute of some sort.

2712
02:42:41.160 --> 02:42:45.060
So the way it was explained to me was that there's some sort of an agenda to

2713
02:42:45.061 --> 02:42:47.790
push out outdoor programming.
You don't believe that's the case?

2714
02:42:47.820 --> 02:42:50.370
I don't know if that's true or not.
You think it's just a contract one,

2715
02:42:50.850 --> 02:42:51.990
the reason I do wonder.
Yeah,

2716
02:42:51.990 --> 02:42:55.400
<v 2>if there's,
there's,
there's something I'd like that is,
it could be that,
you know,</v>

2717
02:42:55.401 --> 02:42:56.630
it definitely came about,

2718
02:42:57.780 --> 02:43:01.670
it seems to have definitely come about at the time of the Cecil the lion deal

2719
02:43:02.540 --> 02:43:05.840
for sure.
They,
and they also said,
well it's low viewership,

2720
02:43:05.841 --> 02:43:07.580
but they carry networks that are lower viewership,

2721
02:43:07.610 --> 02:43:10.940
Al Jazeera or they carry a lot of networks that are lower.
Um,

2722
02:43:11.530 --> 02:43:13.450
I think with the ride,
I think it was some pressure.

2723
02:43:13.451 --> 02:43:17.440
It'll get pressure from viewers who I explain it,

2724
02:43:17.441 --> 02:43:21.340
they want the show of what the show was mean.
Um,
I think that if someone,

2725
02:43:21.341 --> 02:43:24.760
if they are making some kind of stand and it is like,
oh,

2726
02:43:24.761 --> 02:43:29.020
we don't approve a hunting,
I would say,
look at my show and ask yourself,

2727
02:43:29.021 --> 02:43:33.340
is my show a negative or a positive for wildlife and conservation?

2728
02:43:33.370 --> 02:43:34.630
I think the answer is pretty clear.

2729
02:43:34.870 --> 02:43:37.150
I would like to see them really change their mind about that.

2730
02:43:37.690 --> 02:43:39.250
And how do people get in touch?
There's,

2731
02:43:39.280 --> 02:43:43.570
there's a website right there is a website also.
Just go and let,

2732
02:43:43.810 --> 02:43:46.360
if you use any kind of Verizon product,
man,
your phone.

2733
02:43:46.361 --> 02:43:49.870
I use Verizon for my phone and I've definitely let them know.
Um,

2734
02:43:49.900 --> 02:43:50.800
yeah I do as well.

2735
02:43:50.830 --> 02:43:55.120
I hope people can get in there and demand access back.

2736
02:43:56.050 --> 02:43:59.350
<v 3>Yeah.
I'm trying to find the website cause I think it was explained to me.</v>

2737
02:43:59.650 --> 02:44:01.930
Did someone send it to me?
You know,

2738
02:44:01.931 --> 02:44:06.490
you can all change and here it is right here.
Um,
okay.

2739
02:44:07.000 --> 02:44:11.680
Uh,
you can also store it.
Here it is.
I'm sorry.
No,
keep,

2740
02:44:12.520 --> 02:44:15.580
keep my outdoor tv.com.

2741
02:44:15.610 --> 02:44:19.300
So go to keep my outdoor tv.com one word,

2742
02:44:19.380 --> 02:44:21.580
t v t the letter t letter V,

2743
02:44:21.760 --> 02:44:24.910
keep my outdoor tv.com and a link.

2744
02:44:25.150 --> 02:44:29.110
There's a link to call and write their representatives in Washington.

2745
02:44:29.740 --> 02:44:33.970
And uh,
there it is right there.
So that is,
um,

2746
02:44:34.120 --> 02:44:37.660
that's the issue.
And a,
this is a way to,
uh,

2747
02:44:37.690 --> 02:44:40.630
to voice your disapproval of this issue.
And there's the handsome Steven Ella,

2748
02:44:40.631 --> 02:44:41.110
right,

2749
02:44:41.110 --> 02:44:43.780
<v 2>right man.
Now you could always get my shell,</v>

2750
02:44:43.900 --> 02:44:47.750
you know that meat eater dot.
Vh EHS.
Dot.

2751
02:44:47.751 --> 02:44:49.520
T but it's important man.

2752
02:44:49.550 --> 02:44:54.550
It's like the network sportsman channel has been so good to work with over the

2753
02:44:56.481 --> 02:45:01.481
years because they never ever mess with us about content.

2754
02:45:02.300 --> 02:45:05.660
We do the kind of show we want,
we put out the kind of message we want.

2755
02:45:06.050 --> 02:45:09.370
It's like it's just the,
it's just so nice and they,

2756
02:45:09.440 --> 02:45:12.860
and they just allow you to authentic stuff that you think is best.

2757
02:45:13.100 --> 02:45:15.560
It's just they've been great.
Great to work with.

2758
02:45:15.561 --> 02:45:18.800
And I hate to see him crippled in any way.
What other reasons?

2759
02:45:19.170 --> 02:45:22.740
<v 3>The word out.
I'll put this out on Twitter and Facebook tonight and uh,</v>

2760
02:45:22.770 --> 02:45:26.310
hopefully we can make some sort of an impact.
Uh,
in the meantime,

2761
02:45:26.580 --> 02:45:30.150
got to check out the mediator podcast cause it's fucking excellent.
Uh,

2762
02:45:30.160 --> 02:45:33.740
I've been binge listening this week cause I know Joe Rogan experience.

2763
02:45:33.741 --> 02:45:37.160
How dare you.
It's excellent.
It's very good.
And if you're interested in hunting,

2764
02:45:37.161 --> 02:45:38.990
it's very good.
And if you're not interested in hunting,

2765
02:45:39.140 --> 02:45:42.950
you might get interested in hunting from listening to it,
but it's excellent.
Um,

2766
02:45:43.070 --> 02:45:46.670
and then the book,
the book is the complete guide to hunting,
butchering,

2767
02:45:46.910 --> 02:45:50.850
and cooking wild game.
It's available as of August,
right?
It's available,
right?

2768
02:45:51.090 --> 02:45:55.640
One big game is out now.
Volume two,
you can preorder.
All right.
That's it.
And a,

2769
02:45:55.641 --> 02:45:58.520
when are we going hunting again,
man,
we got to figure one out.
Do it.

2770
02:45:59.370 --> 02:46:01.190
You got to figure out what you want to go.
Okay,
we'll figure it out.

2771
02:46:01.280 --> 02:46:05.540
I want to do pandas.
Bad Panda bears.
I'll joke.
Fuck Jesus Christ.

2772
02:46:07.050 --> 02:46:09.500
All right,
well then not that.
See You folks.
