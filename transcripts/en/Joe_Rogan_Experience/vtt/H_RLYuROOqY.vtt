<v Speaker 2>That was not.</v>

6
00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:17.370
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't sure if that was the gun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chris Ryan.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You just traveling in that thing.</v>

10
00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:26.700
<v Speaker 2>I just got back from a month on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>road.</v>

11
00:00:26.701 --> 00:00:27.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I was just New Orleans too,</v>

13
00:00:30.361 --> 00:00:32.280
<v Speaker 2>but it only took three hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

14
00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.550
<v Speaker 2>I took the scenic route.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many days did it take to drive New </v>

15
00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:37.550
<v Speaker 2>Orleans?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

16
00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:38.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we stopped a lot along the way,</v>

17
00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.050
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

18
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.630
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 2>10,</v>

19
00:00:42.631 --> 00:00:45.000
<v Speaker 2>12 days or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to stop?</v>

20
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.010
<v Speaker 2>We actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we went down along the border.</v>

21
00:00:47.011 --> 00:00:50.060
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were in Bisbee a standard now.</v>

22
00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.910
<v Speaker 2>He was in Asia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was um,</v>

23
00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Southeast Asia.</v>

24
00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.720
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when you think of [inaudible],</v>

25
00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.700
<v Speaker 2>you think of Stan up in extra ball at </v>
<v Speaker 2>this point.</v>

26
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:04.520
<v Speaker 2>It's not much of a reason to go to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You say you didn't visit standard.</v>

27
00:01:04.521 --> 00:01:07.020
<v Speaker 2>Like if she went to Phoenix and didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>visit a guy that you knew there,</v>

28
00:01:07.021 --> 00:01:07.920
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry man,</v>

29
00:01:07.921 --> 00:01:09.170
<v Speaker 2>I got really busy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

30
00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:11.310
<v Speaker 2>that's normal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you went to Brisbane,</v>

31
00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.400
<v Speaker 2>didn't visit Stan Hope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

32
00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.150
<v Speaker 2>How many people are in Brisbane?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

33
00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.180
<v Speaker 2>but there are low.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a strange little place if you've </v>

34
00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:20.180
<v Speaker 2>been there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No scared.</v>

35
00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.290
<v Speaker 2>It's like this giant open pit mine and </v>
<v Speaker 2>like the hills are all kind of purple </v>

36
00:01:25.171 --> 00:01:28.050
<v Speaker 2>and weird colors because it's all slag </v>
<v Speaker 2>from the mine.</v>

37
00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:28.980
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

38
00:01:28.981 --> 00:01:32.190
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a toxic looking place.</v>

39
00:01:32.191 --> 00:01:37.191
<v Speaker 2>I got to say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why anyone would choose to </v>

40
00:01:37.191 --> 00:01:39.891
<v Speaker 2>live their real estate crashes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dr Chris Ryan Trash has been going down.</v>

41
00:01:42.211 --> 00:01:44.850
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying anything that isn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty obvious.</v>

42
00:01:44.851 --> 00:01:48.480
<v Speaker 2>If you drive through town,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure they're a nice parts of town.</v>

43
00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.010
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We just drove through.</v>

44
00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.090
<v Speaker 2>I was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The coolest thing about this van is I've</v>

45
00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:59.150
<v Speaker 2>combined it with the podcast and so I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>traveling and I'm also meeting people </v>

46
00:01:59.911 --> 00:02:02.160
<v Speaker 2>along the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of which are planned,</v>

47
00:02:02.161 --> 00:02:05.010
<v Speaker 2>like if Stan hope had been around and </v>
<v Speaker 2>was willing to hang,</v>

48
00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.060
<v Speaker 2>definitely would've hung with them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but others just come up like,</v>

49
00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.550
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right near Bisbee.</v>

50
00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.580
<v Speaker 2>See people follow me on social media and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>

51
00:02:14.581 --> 00:02:15.690
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see you're in Texas.</v>

52
00:02:15.691 --> 00:02:18.300
<v Speaker 2>You should visit my buddy in Terlingua.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I did.</v>

53
00:02:18.301 --> 00:02:19.530
<v Speaker 2>And I'll tell you that starting a </v>
<v Speaker 2>minute,</v>

54
00:02:19.531 --> 00:02:20.830
<v Speaker 2>but near,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

55
00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.130
<v Speaker 2>bisbee this woman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dorothy,</v>

56
00:02:23.131 --> 00:02:24.750
<v Speaker 2>I think her name was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrote to me and she's like,</v>

57
00:02:24.751 --> 00:02:26.190
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're in southern Arizona.</v>

58
00:02:26.191 --> 00:02:31.191
<v Speaker 2>You gotta drop in on my buddy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the rattle snake guy who's been studying</v>

59
00:02:32.221 --> 00:02:37.221
<v Speaker 2>rattle snakes for 50 years by himself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not looking for fame or anything,</v>

60
00:02:38.761 --> 00:02:40.020
<v Speaker 2>but I'll talk to him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he'd,</v>

61
00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.990
<v Speaker 2>he'd like you and you guys would enjoy </v>
<v Speaker 2>each other's company.</v>

62
00:02:42.991 --> 00:02:44.280
<v Speaker 2>And so I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure,</v>

63
00:02:44.281 --> 00:02:46.260
<v Speaker 2>I'll talk to the rattle snake guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Perfect.</v>

64
00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.080
<v Speaker 2>So he came out to this camp site and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>hung out for the morning.</v>

65
00:02:49.081 --> 00:02:51.000
<v Speaker 2>The Sky is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

66
00:02:51.001 --> 00:02:54.510
<v Speaker 2>John Porter is his name.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's been studying snakes for 50 years.</v>

67
00:02:54.511 --> 00:02:59.470
<v Speaker 2>He's just totally interested in them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lives on next to nothing in a trailer in</v>

68
00:02:59.471 --> 00:03:00.040
<v Speaker 2>the desert.</v>

69
00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.970
<v Speaker 3>That's his focus has been bit 15 times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus.</v>

70
00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.290
<v Speaker 3>What keeps you fucking with snakes after</v>
<v Speaker 3>byte number 11?</v>

71
00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:09.370
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

72
00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.340
<v Speaker 3>Full Bite me 10 times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shame on me.</v>

73
00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:14.830
<v Speaker 3>This is bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This job sucks.</v>

74
00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:16.810
<v Speaker 3>Like how many years has he been doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>it?</v>

75
00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.370
<v Speaker 3>Fifty years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>50.</v>

76
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.260
<v Speaker 3>He's almost 70.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's incredible.</v>

77
00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.280
<v Speaker 3>And he's in really good shape.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He scrambles around in the hills and and</v>

78
00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.040
<v Speaker 3>pull snakes out of holes and.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

79
00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.570
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a.</v>

80
00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.490
<v Speaker 3>he's a really interesting cat and he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>just like,</v>

81
00:03:30.491 --> 00:03:32.500
<v Speaker 3>that's his passion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what he does.</v>

82
00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:37.530
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did he do the slow amount of venom in </v>

83
00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:38.990
<v Speaker 3>his system to try to make himself </v>
<v Speaker 3>immune?</v>

84
00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:43.090
<v Speaker 3>You can't be immune to it because what I</v>
<v Speaker 3>learned from him,</v>

85
00:03:43.091 --> 00:03:48.091
<v Speaker 3>one of the many things I learned from </v>
<v Speaker 3>him is that rattle snake venom is </v>

86
00:03:48.091 --> 00:03:52.351
<v Speaker 3>essentially digestive enzymes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what what happens is they bite an </v>

87
00:03:53.171 --> 00:03:56.080
<v Speaker 3>animal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The animal runs off 20 feet or something</v>

88
00:03:56.081 --> 00:03:57.100
<v Speaker 3>before it collapses.</v>

89
00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:02.430
<v Speaker 3>The enzymes are digesting the animal </v>
<v Speaker 3>from within because they don't have </v>

90
00:04:04.481 --> 00:04:09.481
<v Speaker 3>enough enzymes within their own </v>
<v Speaker 3>digestive tract to digest the whole </v>

91
00:04:09.481 --> 00:04:09.990
<v Speaker 3>thing from outside.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

92
00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:14.260
<v Speaker 3>So when they get the animal inside them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're digesting it simultaneously from</v>

93
00:04:14.261 --> 00:04:17.230
<v Speaker 3>outside in and then from inside out </v>
<v Speaker 3>cheap.</v>

94
00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:21.520
<v Speaker 3>So that's why.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What a monster these are,</v>

95
00:04:21.521 --> 00:04:22.750
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the snakes that,</v>

96
00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:27.940
<v Speaker 3>that strike a warm blooded animals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the ones that eat cold blooded </v>

97
00:04:28.151 --> 00:04:29.950
<v Speaker 3>animals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have the neurotoxins.</v>

98
00:04:29.951 --> 00:04:34.951
<v Speaker 3>That's a different type of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's a terrifying video that I put on </v>

99
00:04:34.951 --> 00:04:38.281
<v Speaker 3>my instagram a couple of years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you said rattlesnake one,</v>

100
00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:40.390
<v Speaker 3>you'll never find it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like way back there.</v>

101
00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:41.590
<v Speaker 3>Jamie smiled.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a call.</v>

102
00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.240
<v Speaker 3>It's a challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

103
00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:46.150
<v Speaker 3>I retweet it or repost it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Somebody else's.</v>

104
00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:49.540
<v Speaker 3>Some guys were hunting and a rattle </v>
<v Speaker 3>snake was pulling a rabbit.</v>

105
00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:55.410
<v Speaker 3>And just the way this demon thing just </v>
<v Speaker 3>pulled this poor little fuzzy rabbit.</v>

106
00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:59.050
<v Speaker 3>But I instantly made the </v>
<v Speaker 3>differentiation.</v>

107
00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:04.150
<v Speaker 3>I instantly differentiated which one I </v>
<v Speaker 3>was on team whose team I'm on.</v>

108
00:05:04.271 --> 00:05:05.230
<v Speaker 3>I'm on team,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fluffy,</v>

109
00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:06.810
<v Speaker 3>fluffy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and furry roadways.</v>

110
00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:09.400
<v Speaker 3>Anything that's very well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unless,</v>

111
00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.920
<v Speaker 3>unless you've got a gun or a bow in your</v>
<v Speaker 3>hands,</v>

112
00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:15.430
<v Speaker 3>well to eat it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the most delicious.</v>

113
00:05:15.431 --> 00:05:15.840
<v Speaker 3>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

114
00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:17.930
<v Speaker 3>I'm not judging it at all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what I'm saying is it's.</v>

115
00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:21.010
<v Speaker 3>But if something else was going after </v>
<v Speaker 3>that snake,</v>

116
00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:23.560
<v Speaker 3>if somebody had killed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like a coyote had killed a snake.</v>

117
00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:28.830
<v Speaker 3>I really wouldn't be bothered by it or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something that bothers me for whatever </v>

118
00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:32.611
<v Speaker 3>weird reason.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think of a rabbit as being not just a </v>

119
00:05:32.611 --> 00:05:32.730
<v Speaker 3>rodent enlightened form there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

120
00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:36.850
<v Speaker 3>I think of it being like fucking Peter </v>
<v Speaker 3>cottontail or something stupid like that</v>

121
00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:38.320
<v Speaker 3>stuff's in your head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Herbivores.</v>

122
00:05:38.321 --> 00:05:39.790
<v Speaker 3>They're innocent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

123
00:05:39.791 --> 00:05:41.980
<v Speaker 3>They're not out there fucking with other</v>
<v Speaker 3>animals.</v>

124
00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:44.650
<v Speaker 3>So it's kind of like very few </v>
<v Speaker 3>herbivores.</v>

125
00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:48.400
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes they eat the birds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the birds when they can,</v>

126
00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:50.890
<v Speaker 3>but they're more just opportunistic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If a bird can't move,</v>

127
00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:52.320
<v Speaker 3>they'll eat a baby bird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

128
00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:54.660
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is this steak?</v>

129
00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:56.620
<v Speaker 3>First Rabbit?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

130
00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.290
<v Speaker 3>it's actually dragging a rabbit in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>desert.</v>

131
00:06:00.291 --> 00:06:03.170
<v Speaker 3>It looks like we're in the mountain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the one where the moms saves the</v>

132
00:06:03.171 --> 00:06:04.430
<v Speaker 3>babies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

133
00:06:04.431 --> 00:06:07.940
<v Speaker 3>is that what it was?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That happened to me once.</v>

134
00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:09.590
<v Speaker 3>I'll give this to mom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rabbit comes over.</v>

135
00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:11.330
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she sees what's going on.</v>

136
00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.130
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is crazy.</v>

137
00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:17.250
<v Speaker 3>That is fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

138
00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.240
<v Speaker 3>that's not the one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This one was a rattlesnake.</v>

139
00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:20.990
<v Speaker 3>A big ass rattle snake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was dry,</v>

140
00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:26.020
<v Speaker 3>it was just the way it was dragging this</v>
<v Speaker 3>rabbet around was so intense when I was </v>

141
00:06:27.171 --> 00:06:27.790
<v Speaker 3>a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

142
00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:29.830
<v Speaker 4>I used to think I was an Indian,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

143
00:06:29.831 --> 00:06:32.680
<v Speaker 4>and I'd wander around the neighborhood </v>
<v Speaker 4>than a loin cloth.</v>

144
00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:36.030
<v Speaker 3>Are you allowed to do that today or </v>
<v Speaker 3>would you get culturally appropriate for</v>

145
00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:40.760
<v Speaker 3>someone to come after you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I probably,</v>

146
00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:44.880
<v Speaker 3>I mean indecent exposure to because it </v>
<v Speaker 3>wasn't wearing underwear.</v>

147
00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:49.930
<v Speaker 3>Oh you terrible person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But with going cloth made out of bath </v>

148
00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:50.960
<v Speaker 3>towel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>herbal bath towel.</v>

149
00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:55.760
<v Speaker 3>So it just folded in thirds and I have a</v>
<v Speaker 3>belt come up with a handgun in the front</v>

150
00:06:55.761 --> 00:06:57.320
<v Speaker 3>and the back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Seriously,</v>

151
00:06:57.321 --> 00:06:59.090
<v Speaker 3>I was totally into it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But anyway,</v>

152
00:06:59.091 --> 00:07:03.170
<v Speaker 3>I was wondering around the neighborhood </v>
<v Speaker 3>in my Indian thing and uh,</v>

153
00:07:03.171 --> 00:07:08.171
<v Speaker 3>I saw this rabbit and there was a bush </v>
<v Speaker 3>with these hard little fruits on it and </v>

154
00:07:08.171 --> 00:07:09.650
<v Speaker 3>I grabbed on these fruits and I threw it</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the rabbit.</v>

155
00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:14.270
<v Speaker 3>I fucking hit it [inaudible] the rabbit </v>
<v Speaker 3>started flopping and boom,</v>

156
00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:16.430
<v Speaker 3>just laid there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

157
00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:19.700
<v Speaker 3>I just killed that fucking with a piece </v>
<v Speaker 3>of fruit with a hard,</v>

158
00:07:19.701 --> 00:07:24.701
<v Speaker 3>like little crab apple or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I walk over and look at the rabbit </v>

159
00:07:24.701 --> 00:07:26.030
<v Speaker 3>and it's just laying there and then I </v>
<v Speaker 3>hear the squeak,</v>

160
00:07:26.031 --> 00:07:26.840
<v Speaker 3>squeak,</v>
<v Speaker 3>squeak,</v>

161
00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:31.400
<v Speaker 3>squeak under this pine tree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I go and there's this nest of little</v>

162
00:07:31.401 --> 00:07:33.860
<v Speaker 3>baby rabbits with their eyes still </v>
<v Speaker 3>closed.</v>

163
00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:38.270
<v Speaker 3>Little tiny ones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just fucking killed their mother dude.</v>

164
00:07:38.271 --> 00:07:40.340
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

165
00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:41.300
<v Speaker 3>what a bummer.</v>

166
00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:45.390
<v Speaker 4>I uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I took the babies home crying.</v>

167
00:07:45.391 --> 00:07:47.250
<v Speaker 4>She really did kill the mother with a </v>
<v Speaker 4>crab.</v>

168
00:07:47.251 --> 00:07:52.251
<v Speaker 4>Apple should have been major league.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He should've been playing for the </v>

169
00:07:52.251 --> 00:07:52.500
<v Speaker 4>dodgers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

170
00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:53.670
<v Speaker 4>chicken,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I kind of pitch.</v>

171
00:07:53.671 --> 00:07:56.970
<v Speaker 4>So I took the babies home and the next </v>
<v Speaker 4>door neighbor,</v>

172
00:07:56.971 --> 00:08:01.971
<v Speaker 4>my friend's mother was a nurse and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>showed her and she had like a syringe </v>

173
00:08:02.131 --> 00:08:07.131
<v Speaker 4>without the needle and she showed me you</v>
<v Speaker 4>have to mix a can't give them straight </v>

174
00:08:07.131 --> 00:08:10.290
<v Speaker 4>milk because the rabbit milk is thinner </v>
<v Speaker 4>so you have to mix water with it and all</v>

175
00:08:10.291 --> 00:08:11.780
<v Speaker 4>this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I was feeding them and,</v>

176
00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:15.300
<v Speaker 4>and then I went back actually a little </v>
<v Speaker 4>while later,</v>

177
00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:16.540
<v Speaker 4>maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

178
00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:19.590
<v Speaker 4>the next day or something and the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the big rabbit was gone.</v>

179
00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:23.250
<v Speaker 4>Which then later in life I thought maybe</v>
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't dead,</v>

180
00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:27.570
<v Speaker 4>maybe it was faking it to try to save </v>
<v Speaker 4>the babies to distract me</v>

181
00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:29.250
<v Speaker 3>more likely coyote.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>

182
00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:32.420
<v Speaker 3>it made me just a knockout.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You knocked out the rabbit.</v>

183
00:08:32.421 --> 00:08:37.421
<v Speaker 3>That makes sense because if you get hit </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the head with something that you </v>

184
00:08:37.421 --> 00:08:39.881
<v Speaker 3>don't see coming,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very likely your branch could just </v>

185
00:08:39.881 --> 00:08:39.881
<v Speaker 3>shut off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

186
00:08:39.970 --> 00:08:41.290
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So anyway,</v>

187
00:08:41.291 --> 00:08:45.130
<v Speaker 4>I raised these rabbits.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm until,</v>

188
00:08:45.131 --> 00:08:47.140
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a few weeks until their eyes opened.</v>

189
00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:48.370
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

190
00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:50.610
<v Speaker 4>And then we'll do them boil them or </v>
<v Speaker 4>from.</v>

191
00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:51.450
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

192
00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:56.220
<v Speaker 4>Then we had to go visit my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my uncle in Ohio</v>

193
00:08:56.340 --> 00:09:01.340
<v Speaker 3>and I left the rabbits with this girl </v>
<v Speaker 3>and told her how to take care of them </v>

194
00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:02.520
<v Speaker 3>and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

195
00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:06.690
<v Speaker 3>the girl apparently forgot about mixing </v>
<v Speaker 3>the water.</v>

196
00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:10.530
<v Speaker 3>And so by the time I got back after a </v>
<v Speaker 3>three day weekend,</v>

197
00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:13.020
<v Speaker 3>a couple of them had died,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she didn't want to tell me.</v>

198
00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:15.650
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were 10,</v>

199
00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:18.810
<v Speaker 3>11 and actually it was all through the </v>
<v Speaker 3>biology teacher.</v>

200
00:09:18.811 --> 00:09:23.811
<v Speaker 3>And then it turned out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the time that she told they were all </v>

201
00:09:23.811 --> 00:09:24.120
<v Speaker 3>dead,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they all just died.</v>

202
00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:26.580
<v Speaker 3>They probably would have had a hard go </v>
<v Speaker 3>of it anyway.</v>

203
00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:28.260
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

204
00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:32.190
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you missed your calling baseball.</v>

205
00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:34.500
<v Speaker 3>Baseball.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So boring.</v>

206
00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:39.830
<v Speaker 3>It's definitely boring.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's one of those things that you </v>

207
00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:39.830
<v Speaker 3>couldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And people right now are screaming,</v>

208
00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:40.860
<v Speaker 3>fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your fans hate me.</v>

209
00:09:40.861 --> 00:09:41.980
<v Speaker 3>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stats.</v>

210
00:09:42.010 --> 00:09:43.710
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's definitely not true.</v>

211
00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:46.140
<v Speaker 3>I see it occasionally attention to those</v>
<v Speaker 3>comments.</v>

212
00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:52.080
<v Speaker 3>They're amusing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're only the people that would </v>

213
00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:52.080
<v Speaker 3>comment something shitty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

214
00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:53.600
<v Speaker 3>They're the only ones that are going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>get to you to also.</v>

215
00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:58.610
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of Kuk Beta stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the because they assume I am in an open </v>

216
00:09:58.891 --> 00:10:01.920
<v Speaker 3>relationship and so therefore there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>all that kind of stuff.</v>

217
00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:04.050
<v Speaker 3>You're that cut thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's interesting.</v>

218
00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:09.080
<v Speaker 3>Anyone who would call someone else a </v>
<v Speaker 3>cook or a Beta male is most likely.</v>

219
00:10:10.201 --> 00:10:15.201
<v Speaker 3>I don't think you could say anyone </v>
<v Speaker 3>because sometimes people just are and </v>

220
00:10:15.201 --> 00:10:17.610
<v Speaker 3>some people say it and they're correct,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think been the most part.</v>

221
00:10:17.611 --> 00:10:20.550
<v Speaker 3>But why would you just shut that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not in an argument.</v>

222
00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:22.560
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You aren't in an argument with them,</v>

223
00:10:22.561 --> 00:10:25.230
<v Speaker 3>you don't know them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You guys aren't so widely insulting you.</v>

224
00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.510
<v Speaker 3>Why are they going after?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's because of insecurity.</v>

225
00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:32.780
<v Speaker 3>Let's also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because of this weird way of expressing </v>

226
00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:32.780
<v Speaker 3>each other ourselves on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on instant,</v>

227
00:10:32.890 --> 00:10:33.810
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on twitter,</v>

228
00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:39.140
<v Speaker 3>facebook and stuff to instant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that instantaneous ability to just go </v>

229
00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:39.420
<v Speaker 3>after something.</v>

230
00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:44.420
<v Speaker 3>You don't meet them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't establish a friendship with </v>

231
00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:44.420
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't talk to them is why I'm saying</v>

232
00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:44.970
<v Speaker 3>it's a reflection.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As a psychologist,</v>

233
00:10:44.971 --> 00:10:47.120
<v Speaker 3>I find it really interesting because </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an,</v>

234
00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:47.970
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

235
00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:51.270
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see these guys every fucking day.</v>

236
00:10:51.271 --> 00:10:55.290
<v Speaker 3>There's another story about an anti gay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

237
00:10:55.291 --> 00:11:00.210
<v Speaker 3>minister who's been sucking little boys </v>
<v Speaker 3>Dick's everyday or even big black guy,</v>

238
00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:03.960
<v Speaker 3>Dick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever is available dixies into.</v>

239
00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:05.910
<v Speaker 3>But if he's trying to like pray the gay </v>
<v Speaker 3>away.</v>

240
00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:07.140
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>

241
00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:11.880
<v Speaker 3>There's some gates going on somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we reveal our deepest secrets in</v>

242
00:11:11.881 --> 00:11:14.280
<v Speaker 3>our loudest accusations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you're right.</v>

243
00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:15.600
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so this whole,</v>

244
00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:20.960
<v Speaker 3>the trolling and stuff going on online </v>
<v Speaker 3>is interesting because people don't </v>

245
00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:23.100
<v Speaker 3>realize that they're exposing </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves,</v>

246
00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:24.780
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

247
00:11:24.781 --> 00:11:25.940
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's also,</v>

248
00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:30.990
<v Speaker 3>it's a really shitty way of interacting </v>
<v Speaker 3>with humans that some people participate</v>

249
00:11:30.991 --> 00:11:35.991
<v Speaker 3>in almost exclusively,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like there's some people right now in </v>

250
00:11:35.991 --> 00:11:37.260
<v Speaker 3>our culture that they're communicating </v>
<v Speaker 3>with people,</v>

251
00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:39.300
<v Speaker 3>but the people that they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>communicating with,</v>

252
00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:44.360
<v Speaker 3>their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their only communicating with people </v>

253
00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:44.430
<v Speaker 3>online,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're only doing it through twitter or</v>

254
00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:49.460
<v Speaker 3>facebook or however they do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so like their days are spent interacting</v>

255
00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:54.010
<v Speaker 3>just randomly with people tweeting at </v>
<v Speaker 3>them</v>

256
00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:56.020
<v Speaker 5>and reading tweets or reading,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

257
00:11:56.050 --> 00:12:01.050
<v Speaker 5>reading message board posts or posting </v>
<v Speaker 5>things or reading instagram passages.</v>

258
00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:07.300
<v Speaker 5>All they're doing is interacting with </v>
<v Speaker 5>people online and I just think there's a</v>

259
00:12:07.301 --> 00:12:10.480
<v Speaker 5>lot of kids developing that way because </v>
<v Speaker 5>they're not even.</v>

260
00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:14.740
<v Speaker 5>Even when they're around each other,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're spending more time communicating</v>

261
00:12:14.741 --> 00:12:19.741
<v Speaker 5>with people through a device than they </v>
<v Speaker 5>are doing it face to face because </v>

262
00:12:19.741 --> 00:12:22.480
<v Speaker 5>they're always distracted and I feel </v>
<v Speaker 5>like this is a very.</v>

263
00:12:22.770 --> 00:12:27.060
<v Speaker 5>It's not indicative of how we evolved </v>
<v Speaker 5>like these,</v>

264
00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:31.360
<v Speaker 5>this method of communication.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So like people say there's way more hate</v>

265
00:12:31.361 --> 00:12:33.820
<v Speaker 5>today than it's ever been before.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think so.</v>

266
00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:38.940
<v Speaker 5>I think it's the same amount of hate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's just this new weird form of </v>

267
00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:42.361
<v Speaker 5>expression that doesn't make you take </v>
<v Speaker 5>into consideration the other people's </v>

268
00:12:42.361 --> 00:12:45.061
<v Speaker 5>feelings.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like the only time we've ever had </v>

269
00:12:45.061 --> 00:12:47.401
<v Speaker 5>something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like if you killed someone or you beat </v>

270
00:12:47.401 --> 00:12:47.830
<v Speaker 5>someone up and you looked at them and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they looked at you and you knew that you</v>

271
00:12:47.831 --> 00:12:51.010
<v Speaker 5>hated them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>at least that's an honest attack,</v>

272
00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:54.970
<v Speaker 5>but if you're.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you want something terrible to happen</v>

273
00:12:54.971 --> 00:12:58.270
<v Speaker 5>to someone and you don't even know them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he just heard him on a podcast.</v>

274
00:12:58.271 --> 00:13:03.271
<v Speaker 5>He was a guest and he annoyed Usi want </v>
<v Speaker 5>terrible things to happen to them like </v>

275
00:13:03.271 --> 00:13:03.520
<v Speaker 5>you're not even.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't even know.</v>

276
00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:05.320
<v Speaker 4>It's like traffic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>anger,</v>

277
00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:08.920
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck you like that guy in that car.</v>

278
00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:11.490
<v Speaker 5>I know where that comes from.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The right traffic.</v>

279
00:13:11.491 --> 00:13:16.491
<v Speaker 5>Anger comes from a heightened sense of </v>
<v Speaker 5>awareness because you're going so fast </v>

280
00:13:16.491 --> 00:13:16.890
<v Speaker 5>because you're in your car.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Scared.</v>

281
00:13:16.891 --> 00:13:17.380
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

282
00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:22.490
<v Speaker 5>you're ramped up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're looking constantly for anything </v>

283
00:13:22.490 --> 00:13:23.370
<v Speaker 5>to go wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can't be at zero and just drive.</v>

284
00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:28.400
<v Speaker 5>When you're driving,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're very aware that you're at the </v>

285
00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:30.711
<v Speaker 5>wheel of a big fucking thing that had </v>
<v Speaker 5>car accidents happen and people die on </v>

286
00:13:30.711 --> 00:13:30.720
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everybody's aware of that.</v>

287
00:13:30.721 --> 00:13:32.310
<v Speaker 5>So you get,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you get ramped up.</v>

288
00:13:32.510 --> 00:13:37.510
<v Speaker 4>Although it's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wrote a motorcycle everyday for about </v>

289
00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:39.140
<v Speaker 4>seven years and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I felt very calm on the motorcycle.</v>

290
00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:43.430
<v Speaker 4>I think [inaudible] freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's freedom and vulnerability.</v>

291
00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:47.330
<v Speaker 4>Do you have both the Gemma Harley BMW.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I knew it.</v>

292
00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:52.600
<v Speaker 4>I'm a guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not a Harley guy and some European </v>

293
00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:52.600
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fine,</v>

294
00:13:52.670 --> 00:13:54.500
<v Speaker 4>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Low Center of gravity.</v>

295
00:13:54.590 --> 00:13:56.630
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I drove that like a grandpa too.</v>

296
00:13:56.631 --> 00:14:01.631
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I never got pulled over because in span </v>

297
00:14:01.631 --> 00:14:01.631
<v Speaker 4>I never had a Spanish audience.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>

298
00:14:01.631 --> 00:14:06.490
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's amazing because I shouldn't say </v>

299
00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:06.490
<v Speaker 4>that online.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Probably not.</v>

300
00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:08.520
<v Speaker 4>It's too late now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>About um,</v>

301
00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:09.560
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

302
00:14:09.561 --> 00:14:11.200
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the thing in Spanish,</v>

303
00:14:11.201 --> 00:14:14.620
<v Speaker 4>it's funny because if you come from,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

304
00:14:14.690 --> 00:14:15.940
<v Speaker 4>Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uganda,</v>

305
00:14:15.950 --> 00:14:20.950
<v Speaker 4>wherever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you immigrate to Spain and you get </v>

306
00:14:20.950 --> 00:14:24.491
<v Speaker 4>residency,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to turn in your driver's </v>

307
00:14:24.491 --> 00:14:24.491
<v Speaker 4>license and they'll give you a Spanish </v>
<v Speaker 4>license.</v>

308
00:14:24.491 --> 00:14:28.511
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The only country where they won't honor </v>

309
00:14:28.511 --> 00:14:28.511
<v Speaker 4>your license is United States.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

310
00:14:28.511 --> 00:14:33.310
<v Speaker 4>You got to go to driving school,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that bullshit night school for six </v>

311
00:14:33.310 --> 00:14:35.510
<v Speaker 4>weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>take the ridiculous test that's designed</v>

312
00:14:35.511 --> 00:14:40.511
<v Speaker 4>to trick you and it's the translation </v>
<v Speaker 4>into English is incomprehensible it and </v>

313
00:14:40.511 --> 00:14:42.290
<v Speaker 4>then you got to do it again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like 4,000</v>

314
00:14:42.291 --> 00:14:47.291
<v Speaker 4>euros.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a giant scam and it's only for us </v>

315
00:14:47.291 --> 00:14:51.630
<v Speaker 4>for America.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the reason is that all the Spanish </v>

316
00:14:51.630 --> 00:14:52.070
<v Speaker 4>kids were to the US doing</v>

317
00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:57.110
<v Speaker 2>like high school exchange thing and to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get it you have to be 18 to get a </v>

318
00:14:57.110 --> 00:14:59.330
<v Speaker 2>driver's license in Spain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But in the US 16 obviously.</v>

319
00:14:59.331 --> 00:15:04.331
<v Speaker 2>So they would come here and it's 16.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'd get a driver's license and then </v>

320
00:15:04.331 --> 00:15:04.331
<v Speaker 2>they'd go back to Spain and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

321
00:15:04.331 --> 00:15:06.020
<v Speaker 2>give me the license.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to do it.</v>

322
00:15:06.021 --> 00:15:11.021
<v Speaker 2>It's so Spain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They talked to the American government </v>

323
00:15:11.021 --> 00:15:11.021
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

324
00:15:11.021 --> 00:15:13.130
<v Speaker 2>stop giving Spanish kids licenses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the US is like,</v>

325
00:15:13.131 --> 00:15:14.630
<v Speaker 2>fuck you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we do it the way we do it.</v>

326
00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:17.540
<v Speaker 2>We're number one and let's face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>

327
00:15:17.541 --> 00:15:19.220
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then fucking Americans.</v>

328
00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:24.750
<v Speaker 2>And so now it's this giant pain in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ass if you're an American living in </v>

329
00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:24.750
<v Speaker 2>Spain.</v>

330
00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:28.890
<v Speaker 6>Oh Man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So what happens if you get caught and </v>

331
00:15:28.890 --> 00:15:28.890
<v Speaker 6>you don't have a license?</v>
<v Speaker 6>So if you're driving around,</v>

332
00:15:28.890 --> 00:15:29.110
<v Speaker 6>you're going to find how much?</v>

333
00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:31.590
<v Speaker 2>A few hundred euros.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That seems like a bargain.</v>

334
00:15:31.591 --> 00:15:36.591
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I figured they paid over 10 </v>

335
00:15:36.591 --> 00:15:36.591
<v Speaker 2>times in order to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

336
00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:38.920
<v Speaker 2>what you do is pretend you're a tourist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

337
00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:41.170
<v Speaker 2>Just in town.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have your passport,</v>

338
00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:46.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't have a vehicle registered in your </v>

339
00:15:46.470 --> 00:15:49.171
<v Speaker 2>name.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not that I would ever do any of these </v>

340
00:15:49.171 --> 00:15:49.171
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

341
00:15:49.171 --> 00:15:52.010
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was reading about a ex pats and about </v>

342
00:15:52.010 --> 00:15:55.220
<v Speaker 6>people who just decide to just like go </v>
<v Speaker 6>and move over to Europe for awhile.</v>

343
00:15:55.310 --> 00:16:00.310
<v Speaker 6>It's totally cup.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Such an adventurous thing to do if you </v>

344
00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:03.441
<v Speaker 6>really think about it as an American </v>
<v Speaker 6>because Americans are for sure locked </v>

345
00:16:03.691 --> 00:16:05.880
<v Speaker 6>into our way of thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like there's A.</v>

346
00:16:06.330 --> 00:16:07.890
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to speak for the whole </v>
<v Speaker 6>group,</v>

347
00:16:08.190 --> 00:16:10.830
<v Speaker 6>but when you think of the typical </v>
<v Speaker 6>American,</v>

348
00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:16.070
<v Speaker 6>you think of someone who just.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They like things the way they have them </v>

349
00:16:16.070 --> 00:16:16.620
<v Speaker 6>here.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is the best.</v>

350
00:16:16.830 --> 00:16:20.310
<v Speaker 6>We're number one.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well those people are getting away from.</v>

351
00:16:20.610 --> 00:16:21.720
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's a lot.</v>

352
00:16:21.721 --> 00:16:26.721
<v Speaker 6>But.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But the point is like if you even have </v>

353
00:16:26.721 --> 00:16:27.450
<v Speaker 6>an a niggling of that and then you </v>
<v Speaker 6>decided to move to Italy for a year,</v>

354
00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:30.000
<v Speaker 6>that will go away.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You will realize like,</v>

355
00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:30.690
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>

356
00:16:31.170 --> 00:16:32.400
<v Speaker 6>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Form One of the.</v>

357
00:16:32.401 --> 00:16:36.870
<v Speaker 6>I think that's one of the reasons why </v>
<v Speaker 6>people cling so hard to those norms I go</v>

358
00:16:36.871 --> 00:16:37.920
<v Speaker 6>because they know.</v>

359
00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:40.470
<v Speaker 6>I think they know that Cambodia is </v>
<v Speaker 6>different.</v>

360
00:16:40.650 --> 00:16:43.380
<v Speaker 6>And if they were living in Cambodia,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they'd be living like Cambodians.</v>

361
00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:46.920
<v Speaker 6>They know that Laos is different.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They know that Vietnam is different.</v>

362
00:16:46.921 --> 00:16:51.921
<v Speaker 6>How could that be?</v>
<v Speaker 6>How could these people in these other </v>

363
00:16:51.921 --> 00:16:54.051
<v Speaker 6>places be just like you just a person,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but they walk around in a rice patty all</v>

364
00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:57.480
<v Speaker 6>day and they pushed an ox and they don't</v>
<v Speaker 6>have cell phones.</v>

365
00:16:57.481 --> 00:16:59.940
<v Speaker 6>Like how did that happen?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Could that have happened to you?</v>

366
00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:05.150
<v Speaker 6>Like if you just got a weird roll the </v>
<v Speaker 6>dice and instead of coming out with a </v>

367
00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:05.150
<v Speaker 6>seven,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you came out with a three.</v>

368
00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:06.550
<v Speaker 6>Could you have been in Laos,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you.</v>

369
00:17:06.750 --> 00:17:10.410
<v Speaker 6>Unless you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

370
00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:12.840
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from a Laotians perspective,</v>

371
00:17:12.841 --> 00:17:14.780
<v Speaker 2>he got the 70 and you got the three.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 6>But yeah,</v>

378
00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:33.740
<v Speaker 2>whole thing is just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I traveled all through my twenties and </v>

379
00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:34.700
<v Speaker 2>thirties was for that insight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

380
00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:39.870
<v Speaker 2>To see it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to see it and you got an </v>

381
00:17:39.870 --> 00:17:39.870
<v Speaker 2>impersonal right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

382
00:17:39.870 --> 00:17:43.900
<v Speaker 2>And you gotta move slowly enough that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you had Joseph Campbell called a d </v>

383
00:17:45.391 --> 00:17:50.070
<v Speaker 2>tribalization to to understand that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>from a tribe,</v>

384
00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:55.520
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody thinks everyone else has an </v>

385
00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:55.520
<v Speaker 2>accent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't,</v>

386
00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:55.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

387
00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:59.560
<v Speaker 2>there are all these biases that we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>unaware of until you get out and look </v>

388
00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:01.320
<v Speaker 2>back at yourself and where you came </v>
<v Speaker 2>from.</v>

389
00:18:02.010 --> 00:18:05.580
<v Speaker 2>And so I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was based in Spain for 25 years,</v>

390
00:18:05.581 --> 00:18:07.220
<v Speaker 2>so really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

391
00:18:07.290 --> 00:18:12.290
<v Speaker 2>got into Spanish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've lived in Spain longer than I've </v>

392
00:18:12.290 --> 00:18:12.450
<v Speaker 2>lived in any other country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you don't speak Spanish.</v>

393
00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:17.710
<v Speaker 2>Charter do for Kelly by skt says I </v>
<v Speaker 2>speak,</v>

394
00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:21.810
<v Speaker 2>I speak badly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you speak it.</v>

395
00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:25.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand everything and I sound like</v>

396
00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:29.160
<v Speaker 2>I gave a talk in Argentina once and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>came up after and they said,</v>

397
00:18:29.161 --> 00:18:30.140
<v Speaker 2>I sounded like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

398
00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:35.180
<v Speaker 2>somebody said I sounded like a on Gringo</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I learned Spanish in Catalonia,</v>

399
00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:39.360
<v Speaker 2>so I have this very specific accent in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Spanish,</v>

400
00:18:39.361 --> 00:18:40.670
<v Speaker 2>which I'm totally unaware of.</v>

401
00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:42.660
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>intellectually that makes sense to me,</v>

402
00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:46.950
<v Speaker 2>but my brain is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what different Spanish acts,</v>

403
00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:49.040
<v Speaker 2>how the fuck could you tell?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

404
00:18:49.050 --> 00:18:54.050
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously you can take a Spanish person </v>

405
00:18:54.050 --> 00:18:54.050
<v Speaker 2>who learns English in Scotland.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

406
00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:56.230
<v Speaker 2>they sound Scottish speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

407
00:18:56.730 --> 00:18:57.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

408
00:18:58.230 --> 00:19:00.420
<v Speaker 2>Or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or I mean how many number of people that</v>

409
00:19:00.421 --> 00:19:03.260
<v Speaker 2>come from other countries that speak </v>
<v Speaker 2>Spanish or speak English rather,</v>

410
00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:05.610
<v Speaker 2>but they speak it with the accent of </v>
<v Speaker 2>their place in India.</v>

411
00:19:05.850 --> 00:19:08.340
<v Speaker 2>Even Canadians.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so subtle about a boat.</v>

412
00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:09.570
<v Speaker 2>A boat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>polite.</v>

464
00:21:50.191 --> 00:21:53.510
<v Speaker 2>and the accusative case and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in German there are three genders in,</v>

465
00:21:53.511 --> 00:21:53.930
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

466
00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:55.240
<v Speaker 2>there's deed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their das,</v>

467
00:21:55.250 --> 00:21:57.100
<v Speaker 2>masculine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>feminine and neutral,</v>

468
00:21:57.370 --> 00:22:01.390
<v Speaker 2>and every noun has a gender and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a fucking nightmare.</v>

469
00:22:01.391 --> 00:22:04.630
<v Speaker 2>So as neutral for objects like Das boot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

470
00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:05.530
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Objects.</v>

471
00:22:05.531 --> 00:22:10.531
<v Speaker 2>But also it's weird because like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>mentioned girl is neutral and you would </v>

472
00:22:12.551 --> 00:22:15.990
<v Speaker 2>think girl would have a fucking feminine</v>
<v Speaker 2>gender neutral does,</v>

473
00:22:16.130 --> 00:22:17.040
<v Speaker 2>does mention.</v>

474
00:22:17.530 --> 00:22:21.910
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a hair flint was also the soccer coach.</v>

475
00:22:22.510 --> 00:22:27.510
<v Speaker 2>So we sorta had this unspoken agreement </v>
<v Speaker 2>that if I was on the soccer team he </v>

476
00:22:28.061 --> 00:22:31.900
<v Speaker 2>would pass me in German even though I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was lost constantly.</v>

477
00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:37.440
<v Speaker 2>I mean I would have failed out for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he would give me a c as long as I </v>

478
00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:41.491
<v Speaker 2>was on the soccer team.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not that I was a soccer star is just </v>

479
00:22:41.491 --> 00:22:44.581
<v Speaker 2>that he needed enough people on the team</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they'd keep paying him or they'd </v>

480
00:22:44.581 --> 00:22:48.631
<v Speaker 2>shut it down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So my memory of German is basically </v>

481
00:22:48.631 --> 00:22:50.020
<v Speaker 2>humiliation from judy gum because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>never got anywhere,</v>

482
00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:55.800
<v Speaker 2>humiliation and the classes I couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand the fucking thing and </v>

483
00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:59.521
<v Speaker 2>humiliation on the soccer field because </v>
<v Speaker 2>not only did I suck at soccer but he </v>

484
00:22:59.521 --> 00:23:04.471
<v Speaker 2>would scream at me in German.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was in the German class so it was </v>

485
00:23:04.771 --> 00:23:07.450
<v Speaker 2>like God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was my tutoring or something.</v>

486
00:23:07.451 --> 00:23:11.100
<v Speaker 2>So like nine dm Copley.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

487
00:23:11.490 --> 00:23:15.000
<v Speaker 5>My Italian class in high school,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there was this really friendly,</v>

488
00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:18.360
<v Speaker 5>beautiful Puerto Rican girl.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She was beautiful.</v>

489
00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:23.460
<v Speaker 5>Like she was the type of girl that I </v>
<v Speaker 5>would have been way too nervous to ask </v>

490
00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:24.270
<v Speaker 5>out a way too nervous to approach.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just wouldn't have need.</v>

491
00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:26.940
<v Speaker 5>I would've needed a bunch of green </v>
<v Speaker 5>lights to talk to her.</v>

492
00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:32.000
<v Speaker 5>I'd be super nervous,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but she would approach me and she's </v>

493
00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:32.000
<v Speaker 5>always inviting me to go places with </v>
<v Speaker 5>her,</v>

494
00:23:32.130 --> 00:23:34.860
<v Speaker 5>her and her friends and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well what are you guys doing?</v>

495
00:23:34.861 --> 00:23:36.540
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're going to camp out,</v>

496
00:23:36.541 --> 00:23:41.541
<v Speaker 5>we're going to do this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And there was this a getaway for the </v>

497
00:23:41.541 --> 00:23:42.780
<v Speaker 5>weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like one of them I couldn't do.</v>

498
00:23:42.930 --> 00:23:44.400
<v Speaker 5>So I was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was fighting back then,</v>

499
00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:46.100
<v Speaker 5>one of them I couldn't do because I had</v>

500
00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:50.900
<v Speaker 6>a fight and one of them I couldn't do </v>
<v Speaker 6>because I think,</v>

501
00:23:51.890 --> 00:23:53.480
<v Speaker 6>I don't remember what the fucking reason</v>
<v Speaker 6>was,</v>

502
00:23:53.481 --> 00:23:58.481
<v Speaker 6>but it was.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was enough of a reason that I would </v>

503
00:23:58.481 --> 00:24:00.851
<v Speaker 6>say no.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This hot Puerto Rican girl asked me to </v>

504
00:24:00.851 --> 00:24:01.050
<v Speaker 6>go somewhere with her on the weekends.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Beta cook behavior show.</v>

505
00:24:01.150 --> 00:24:02.840
<v Speaker 6>She was so hot.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She was so hot.</v>

506
00:24:02.870 --> 00:24:04.790
<v Speaker 6>She was built like a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean we're both.</v>

507
00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:09.590
<v Speaker 6>I think I was probably 19 and so she was</v>
<v Speaker 6>probably 19 too.</v>

508
00:24:09.591 --> 00:24:11.780
<v Speaker 6>She was,</v>
<v Speaker 6>she was a phenol mom.</v>

509
00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:16.960
<v Speaker 6>I mean her body was just holy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Super duper pretty and super duper </v>

510
00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:19.100
<v Speaker 6>friendly.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I'm thinking one day this is going to</v>

511
00:24:19.101 --> 00:24:19.700
<v Speaker 6>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

512
00:24:20.150 --> 00:24:25.150
<v Speaker 6>So I go to the lunch room one day and it</v>
<v Speaker 6>was the day that it was the trump </v>

513
00:24:25.150 --> 00:24:26.300
<v Speaker 6>airplane.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I know I've talked about this before.</v>

514
00:24:26.390 --> 00:24:31.390
<v Speaker 6>The trump airline,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the runway gear didn't come down and </v>

515
00:24:31.581 --> 00:24:32.510
<v Speaker 6>it's skid.</v>

516
00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:34.730
<v Speaker 6>Like remember when trump had an airline?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do you remember that?</v>

517
00:24:34.731 --> 00:24:35.570
<v Speaker 6>Vaguely,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>

518
00:24:35.571 --> 00:24:40.571
<v Speaker 6>I had a fucking airline side of it and </v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm pretty sure it was him or maybe it </v>

519
00:24:41.361 --> 00:24:43.700
<v Speaker 6>was jet blue.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Now let me think about it.</v>

520
00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.240
<v Speaker 6>It might not have been trump or might </v>
<v Speaker 6>have happened either way.</v>

521
00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:51.290
<v Speaker 6>This airplane skid and you know they had</v>
<v Speaker 6>a foam up the runway,</v>

522
00:24:51.291 --> 00:24:56.291
<v Speaker 6>the whole deal and things skin without </v>
<v Speaker 6>the gear and I showed up and was her and</v>

523
00:24:56.661 --> 00:24:58.940
<v Speaker 6>her friends landing gear fails on trump </v>
<v Speaker 6>jet.</v>

524
00:24:59.180 --> 00:25:00.010
<v Speaker 6>No injuries.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

525
00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:01.520
<v Speaker 6>Nineteen 89.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That is it.</v>

526
00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:04.720
<v Speaker 6>That's exactly when it was happening.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You were in high school in 1980.</v>

527
00:25:05.490 --> 00:25:07.520
<v Speaker 6>That was 89.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That must've been.</v>

528
00:25:07.521 --> 00:25:10.970
<v Speaker 6>I was 21.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

529
00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.160
<v Speaker 6>that doesn't make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It must have been another one.</v>

530
00:25:13.370 --> 00:25:17.360
<v Speaker 6>See if there was one from earlier </v>
<v Speaker 6>because when I was 21 or two given up on</v>

531
00:25:17.361 --> 00:25:20.750
<v Speaker 6>the idea of college,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're going to say,</v>

532
00:25:20.751 --> 00:25:22.190
<v Speaker 6>given up on the idea of her.</v>

533
00:25:22.250 --> 00:25:23.060
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was like,</v>

534
00:25:23.061 --> 00:25:24.980
<v Speaker 6>what am I doing?</v>
<v Speaker 6>When I was 21,</v>

535
00:25:25.010 --> 00:25:26.780
<v Speaker 6>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is just too ridiculous.</v>

536
00:25:26.930 --> 00:25:31.930
<v Speaker 6>And then I started doing standup was </v>
<v Speaker 6>there was a Mexico City air disaster </v>

537
00:25:33.231 --> 00:25:35.900
<v Speaker 6>believes air international.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Mexico City crash.</v>

538
00:25:36.140 --> 00:25:37.070
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it wasn't a crash,</v>

539
00:25:37.071 --> 00:25:38.570
<v Speaker 6>it was the same thing with the landing </v>
<v Speaker 6>gear.</v>

540
00:25:38.571 --> 00:25:40.850
<v Speaker 6>Wouldn't drop down.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Type in airline runway in my memory.</v>

541
00:25:40.851 --> 00:25:43.370
<v Speaker 6>Sucks in Boston.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It wasn't Boston.</v>

542
00:25:43.410 --> 00:25:44.150
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there you go.</v>

543
00:25:44.830 --> 00:25:48.350
<v Speaker 6>I just can't imagine that I was 89.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was 21.</v>

544
00:25:48.770 --> 00:25:51.080
<v Speaker 6>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So what happened with a woman and yeah,</v>

545
00:25:51.081 --> 00:25:52.940
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's definitely not 89 because I was uh,</v>

546
00:25:52.970 --> 00:25:56.610
<v Speaker 6>I was already doing standup by 89,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so I.</v>

547
00:25:56.930 --> 00:26:01.930
<v Speaker 6>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I sit down hundreds of thousands of </v>

548
00:26:01.930 --> 00:26:03.110
<v Speaker 6>people that go and just sit down to the </v>
<v Speaker 6>guys here.</v>

549
00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:07.610
<v Speaker 6>What happened today at the airport and </v>
<v Speaker 6>they'll know what happened.</v>

550
00:26:07.611 --> 00:26:12.611
<v Speaker 6>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this jet came in and the landing gear </v>

551
00:26:12.611 --> 00:26:13.460
<v Speaker 6>didn't drop so it had a skid across the </v>
<v Speaker 6>runway.</v>

552
00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:15.050
<v Speaker 6>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but everybody's okay.</v>

553
00:26:15.260 --> 00:26:17.150
<v Speaker 6>And they all go,</v>
<v Speaker 6>praise God.</v>

554
00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:18.650
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>praise God.</v>

555
00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:20.330
<v Speaker 6>And I went,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

556
00:26:20.990 --> 00:26:24.050
<v Speaker 6>that's the weekend getaway.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The weekend getaway.</v>

557
00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:26.330
<v Speaker 6>It's an indoctrination to a Christian </v>
<v Speaker 6>cult.</v>

558
00:26:26.780 --> 00:26:29.210
<v Speaker 6>They were bananas.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They were in.</v>

559
00:26:29.211 --> 00:26:34.211
<v Speaker 6>They were super proselytizing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They would go everywhere and sit down </v>

560
00:26:34.211 --> 00:26:35.170
<v Speaker 6>with people that were by themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And if you saw,</v>

561
00:26:35.210 --> 00:26:37.820
<v Speaker 6>if they thought you were lonely or an </v>
<v Speaker 6>outcast,</v>

562
00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:43.000
<v Speaker 6>they would send in the hot one,</v>
<v Speaker 6>she would come and sit next to you and </v>

563
00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:44.040
<v Speaker 6>invite you places and then they'd pull </v>
<v Speaker 6>you into the fold and they were just</v>

564
00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:46.500
<v Speaker 5>recruiting people left and right to </v>
<v Speaker 5>join.</v>

565
00:26:46.501 --> 00:26:48.960
<v Speaker 5>And then like I noticed as the class </v>
<v Speaker 5>would go on,</v>

566
00:26:48.961 --> 00:26:53.961
<v Speaker 5>like later in the semester,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I noticed some of the people from the </v>

567
00:26:53.961 --> 00:26:54.060
<v Speaker 5>class,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're now in that little tight group and</v>

568
00:26:54.061 --> 00:26:56.190
<v Speaker 5>they'd all hang together.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was very strange.</v>

569
00:26:56.520 --> 00:27:01.520
<v Speaker 5>It was like I was watching people get,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they got cult it up that was watching it</v>

570
00:27:02.551 --> 00:27:05.970
<v Speaker 5>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it was all like standard standard,</v>

571
00:27:05.971 --> 00:27:07.380
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Christian stuff,</v>

572
00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:12.360
<v Speaker 5>but extremely involved in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Very rabid.</v>

573
00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:14.100
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and recruiting,</v>

574
00:27:14.130 --> 00:27:17.100
<v Speaker 5>proselytizing everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the fact that this had like,</v>

575
00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:19.320
<v Speaker 5>it was very strange because I was like </v>
<v Speaker 5>cute dummy.</v>

576
00:27:19.321 --> 00:27:22.350
<v Speaker 5>Of course she doesn't like you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She wants to bring you to Jesus.</v>

577
00:27:24.850 --> 00:27:29.850
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe if she was going to fuck you to </v>

578
00:27:29.850 --> 00:27:29.850
<v Speaker 2>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't think so.</v>

579
00:27:29.850 --> 00:27:31.280
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have much confidence back then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>believe it or not,</v>

580
00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:33.740
<v Speaker 2>I didn't think it was going to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

581
00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:38.050
<v Speaker 2>Does anyone have confidence at 1920?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really dumb kids.</v>

582
00:27:38.290 --> 00:27:39.840
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's it.</v>

583
00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:42.370
<v Speaker 5>When I was 19 I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I couldn't,</v>

584
00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:45.030
<v Speaker 5>nothing made any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I might've been 20 when it happened.</v>

585
00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:50.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you think you got it figured out in </v>

586
00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:50.080
<v Speaker 2>19 or 20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're destined for a life,</v>

587
00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:51.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stacking shelves somewhere.</v>

588
00:27:51.350 --> 00:27:56.350
<v Speaker 5>I can't imagine that it was in an 89.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't make any sense unless my </v>

589
00:27:56.350 --> 00:27:57.470
<v Speaker 5>whole timeline for when I quit college </v>
<v Speaker 5>is off.</v>

590
00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:03.080
<v Speaker 2>I just finished watching.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm binge watching this new netflix </v>

591
00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:04.110
<v Speaker 2>documentary about the Roger Nishi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

592
00:28:04.111 --> 00:28:06.600
<v Speaker 2>the Sunday I was in Oregon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wild West.</v>

593
00:28:06.630 --> 00:28:08.760
<v Speaker 2>Wild wild country while.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well country.</v>

594
00:28:08.761 --> 00:28:09.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>

595
00:28:09.870 --> 00:28:13.590
<v Speaker 2>It's really good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's how many six episodes I think.</v>

596
00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:15.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we just binge watched it.</v>

597
00:28:15.950 --> 00:28:18.590
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a buddy who was the son Yassa and</v>

598
00:28:18.591 --> 00:28:23.220
<v Speaker 2>for 15 years maybe something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't in Oregon though.</v>

599
00:28:23.221 --> 00:28:26.220
<v Speaker 2>He was always in India.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

600
00:28:26.221 --> 00:28:30.060
<v Speaker 2>that's very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the whole sort of appeal of the cult</v>

601
00:28:30.061 --> 00:28:33.390
<v Speaker 2>and the hunger to be part of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>community.</v>

602
00:28:33.391 --> 00:28:36.390
<v Speaker 2>And it was a very interesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>documentary.</v>

603
00:28:36.530 --> 00:28:38.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I don't think it's too hot.</v>

604
00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:41.220
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it'd be very hard at all </v>
<v Speaker 2>to start a cult.</v>

605
00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:46.580
<v Speaker 2>I just don't think it's very difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think some people would say you </v>

606
00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:48.450
<v Speaker 2>already have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well maybe,</v>

607
00:28:48.810 --> 00:28:50.700
<v Speaker 2>but you can do whatever you want.</v>

608
00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:51.960
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

609
00:28:52.310 --> 00:28:53.070
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

610
00:28:53.071 --> 00:28:55.900
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one's asking you for a.</v>

611
00:28:56.670 --> 00:28:57.940
<v Speaker 2>do you have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you have any.</v>

612
00:28:58.420 --> 00:29:01.180
<v Speaker 2>You need to step up your game there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes onto the window.</v>

613
00:29:01.420 --> 00:29:04.170
<v Speaker 2>Like the instead of the Rolls Royces,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got the porsches,</v>

614
00:29:04.470 --> 00:29:06.410
<v Speaker 2>Porsche,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Porsche Gurus.</v>

615
00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:09.210
<v Speaker 2>I'm realizing I like old cars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>old cars.</v>

616
00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:12.690
<v Speaker 2>You don't even have to drive as good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't have there a different thing.</v>

617
00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:14.790
<v Speaker 2>You ever heard of Mickey Avalon?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

618
00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:19.020
<v Speaker 2>I had him on my podcast recently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really interesting and smart guy.</v>

619
00:29:19.770 --> 00:29:24.770
<v Speaker 2>And He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in addition to being a rapper and </v>

620
00:29:24.770 --> 00:29:24.770
<v Speaker 2>whatever he does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he.</v>

621
00:29:24.930 --> 00:29:28.260
<v Speaker 2>Simon rex is a good friend of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a dirt nasty.</v>

622
00:29:28.261 --> 00:29:31.260
<v Speaker 2>And the two of them were on tour </v>
<v Speaker 2>together anyway.</v>

623
00:29:31.261 --> 00:29:36.261
<v Speaker 2>So I was talking with the Mickey and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>turns out Mickey Restores Antique cars.</v>

624
00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:38.850
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's got like 20 of them,</v>

625
00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:40.800
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like model t's and shit.</v>

626
00:29:40.830 --> 00:29:42.310
<v Speaker 2>Like that's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really interesting</v>

627
00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:44.000
<v Speaker 3>cars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're part,</v>

628
00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:46.810
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is what an old car.</v>

629
00:29:47.250 --> 00:29:49.240
<v Speaker 3>They're just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a different thing,</v>

630
00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:54.420
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's cool to see the process of them </v>

631
00:29:54.420 --> 00:29:55.940
<v Speaker 3>figuring out how to design cars at </v>
<v Speaker 3>faster and faster.</v>

632
00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:59.610
<v Speaker 3>So his car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh God,</v>

633
00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:02.160
<v Speaker 3>that's beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is that 61?</v>

634
00:30:02.170 --> 00:30:06.070
<v Speaker 3>Impala.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A Rockford fosgate equipped 61 in Pollo.</v>

635
00:30:06.130 --> 00:30:09.660
<v Speaker 3>I love that sort of art deco lines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

636
00:30:09.670 --> 00:30:12.850
<v Speaker 3>So when he's doing his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

637
00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:16.030
<v Speaker 3>and I think that is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what they would call Resto Mod.</v>

638
00:30:16.690 --> 00:30:18.210
<v Speaker 3>You know what they take an old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>

639
00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:21.520
<v Speaker 3>that's the best of both worlds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They take an old car and they put modern</v>

640
00:30:21.521 --> 00:30:25.600
<v Speaker 3>brakes in modern suspension and they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>just safer and they ride better.</v>

641
00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:27.950
<v Speaker 3>He could even swap out the engine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

642
00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:29.410
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They all do.</v>

643
00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:31.330
<v Speaker 3>The lot of them do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I should say,</v>

644
00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:34.090
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they use modern fuel injected engine.</v>

645
00:30:34.210 --> 00:30:36.970
<v Speaker 3>You can buy them from almost all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>companies,</v>

646
00:30:36.971 --> 00:30:40.000
<v Speaker 3>Ford sales,</v>
<v Speaker 3>crate engines and people put them in old</v>

647
00:30:40.001 --> 00:30:41.590
<v Speaker 3>mustangs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's amazing.</v>

648
00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:46.060
<v Speaker 3>I love those old Mustang split rear </v>
<v Speaker 3>windows to some of those cars are just.</v>

649
00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:48.700
<v Speaker 3>You look at them and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God damn like,</v>

650
00:30:48.730 --> 00:30:49.540
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

651
00:30:49.541 --> 00:30:51.220
<v Speaker 3>How did they do it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So good then.</v>

652
00:30:51.460 --> 00:30:56.460
<v Speaker 3>And why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you look at those old mustangs are </v>

653
00:30:56.460 --> 00:30:58.831
<v Speaker 3>old corvettes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there are a few years where </v>

654
00:30:58.831 --> 00:30:58.831
<v Speaker 3>corvettes just couldn't have been more </v>
<v Speaker 3>beautiful.</v>

655
00:30:58.831 --> 00:31:00.160
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever seen my 19,</v>
<v Speaker 3>65?</v>

656
00:31:00.310 --> 00:31:04.480
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's to correlate his car I've ever seen</v>

657
00:31:04.481 --> 00:31:06.730
<v Speaker 3>in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a 1965 silver,</v>

658
00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.290
<v Speaker 3>1965 corvette convertible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

659
00:31:10.130 --> 00:31:11.450
<v Speaker 3>Stand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just sit in front of it.</v>

660
00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:16.920
<v Speaker 3>May have seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you and Jay Leno drive around in </v>

661
00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:16.920
<v Speaker 3>that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

662
00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:16.920
<v Speaker 3>Were you in Topanga?</v>

663
00:31:18.610 --> 00:31:23.610
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember watching that clip and </v>

664
00:31:23.610 --> 00:31:23.610
<v Speaker 3>thinking they're dry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

665
00:31:23.610 --> 00:31:23.610
<v Speaker 3>look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

666
00:31:23.610 --> 00:31:27.810
<v Speaker 3>we went to the Angeles crest highway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That car is two years older than me sort</v>

667
00:31:28.541 --> 00:31:30.700
<v Speaker 3>of see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but sort of as the real thing,</v>

668
00:31:30.701 --> 00:31:35.701
<v Speaker 3>like the outside is everything in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>inside as far as like dashboard and </v>

669
00:31:35.701 --> 00:31:39.901
<v Speaker 3>stuff is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you've had the hip replacements and </v>

670
00:31:39.901 --> 00:31:39.901
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are joints.</v>

671
00:31:39.901 --> 00:31:43.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This car has got any of everything in </v>

672
00:31:43.730 --> 00:31:46.300
<v Speaker 3>that car is modern in terms of like the </v>
<v Speaker 3>breaks and the engines,</v>

673
00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:50.740
<v Speaker 3>engines from a 2007 corvette.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just do that then that way,</v>

674
00:31:50.770 --> 00:31:55.600
<v Speaker 3>like you're driving around enrolled car,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it breaks goods at handles good.</v>

675
00:31:55.601 --> 00:31:59.920
<v Speaker 3>It's not a death trap,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but as getting back to the cult thing,</v>

676
00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:01.570
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

677
00:32:01.571 --> 00:32:06.571
<v Speaker 3>I think some of the mechanisms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the psychological mechanisms that make </v>

678
00:32:06.571 --> 00:32:10.501
<v Speaker 3>that possible apply to what's happening </v>
<v Speaker 3>in podcasting these days.</v>

679
00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:13.900
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the beautiful thing about podcasting</v>

680
00:32:13.901 --> 00:32:18.901
<v Speaker 3>is so far no one has taken advantage of </v>
<v Speaker 3>it and started some compound somewhere </v>

681
00:32:18.901 --> 00:32:22.591
<v Speaker 3>and banged everybody's wife didn't file </v>
<v Speaker 3>it or we have this thing on and required</v>

682
00:32:25.271 --> 00:32:30.271
<v Speaker 3>you to give up all your financial money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Worldly goods and patriotic count </v>

683
00:32:31.091 --> 00:32:36.091
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Australian guy that said he was Jesus a </v>

684
00:32:36.091 --> 00:32:39.410
<v Speaker 3>pretty fucking interesting because </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's this whole documentary on it and</v>

685
00:32:39.411 --> 00:32:40.340
<v Speaker 3>he has this woman</v>

686
00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:44.300
<v Speaker 6>and the woman said that he said that she</v>
<v Speaker 6>was married then,</v>

687
00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:49.600
<v Speaker 6>like halfway to the documentary.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You feel that there was another girl in </v>

688
00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:51.650
<v Speaker 6>the past.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He said she was married to a girl,</v>

689
00:32:51.651 --> 00:32:54.170
<v Speaker 6>thinks she's married and he thinks he's </v>
<v Speaker 6>Jesus.</v>

690
00:32:54.210 --> 00:32:56.060
<v Speaker 6>It's fucking hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

691
00:32:56.061 --> 00:32:58.100
<v Speaker 6>Mary was Jesus's mother,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

692
00:32:58.670 --> 00:32:59.570
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yes.</v>

693
00:32:59.630 --> 00:33:04.630
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but they're partying together and </v>

694
00:33:04.630 --> 00:33:04.630
<v Speaker 6>banging because the reincarnated.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So really Mary.</v>

695
00:33:04.630 --> 00:33:08.030
<v Speaker 6>So Jesus was a motherfucker in his,</v>
<v Speaker 6>his own motherfucker.</v>

696
00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:11.540
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I love my,</v>

697
00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:13.700
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>All right.</v>

698
00:33:13.701 --> 00:33:15.020
<v Speaker 6>She's not married.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The mother.</v>

699
00:33:15.021 --> 00:33:16.940
<v Speaker 6>She's Mary Magdalen the uh.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

700
00:33:16.941 --> 00:33:21.010
<v Speaker 6>the prostitute.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's fitting in.</v>

701
00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:24.740
<v Speaker 6>Maybe the other.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Mary was the mom is the last gospel.</v>

702
00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:30.170
<v Speaker 6>Is that what he says?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Dan Brown?</v>

703
00:33:31.290 --> 00:33:36.290
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The Brown was hanging with the hookers </v>

704
00:33:36.290 --> 00:33:38.510
<v Speaker 6>and very accepting of sex workers.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

705
00:33:38.511 --> 00:33:39.440
<v Speaker 6>Why not?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

706
00:33:39.441 --> 00:33:42.110
<v Speaker 6>God made people horny.</v>
<v Speaker 6>God knew what he was doing,</v>

707
00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:44.960
<v Speaker 6>but God made us monogamous.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Joe.</v>

708
00:33:45.100 --> 00:33:46.640
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>get me started.</v>

709
00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:48.540
<v Speaker 6>It's one of the reasons why I wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 6>have you on.</v>

710
00:33:49.980 --> 00:33:53.450
<v Speaker 6>I have an intervention that Weinstein,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

711
00:33:53.451 --> 00:33:55.520
<v Speaker 6>you're going to get me married,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

712
00:33:55.521 --> 00:34:00.521
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I told you in the email that I felt bad </v>

713
00:34:00.521 --> 00:34:01.850
<v Speaker 6>when your book came up on the show and I</v>
<v Speaker 6>didn't know how to defend it.</v>

714
00:34:02.180 --> 00:34:03.650
<v Speaker 6>I didn't know what to do because I </v>
<v Speaker 6>didn't,</v>

715
00:34:03.890 --> 00:34:08.890
<v Speaker 6>I was in that weird moment where I was </v>
<v Speaker 6>recommending it because I like it </v>

716
00:34:08.890 --> 00:34:11.900
<v Speaker 6>because I think it's a great book.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And he was saying that just debunked.</v>

717
00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:15.500
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think he picked data right?</v>

718
00:34:16.310 --> 00:34:17.450
<v Speaker 6>Which is always weird.</v>

719
00:34:17.980 --> 00:34:18.910
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing is,</v>

720
00:34:19.090 --> 00:34:24.090
<v Speaker 2>any sort of popular non science or </v>
<v Speaker 2>nonfiction book is you have to choose </v>

721
00:34:25.631 --> 00:34:27.210
<v Speaker 2>what data you're going to include,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

722
00:34:27.220 --> 00:34:32.220
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's an infinite amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>data and so of course you form an </v>

723
00:34:32.291 --> 00:34:35.860
<v Speaker 2>argument and then you present data that </v>
<v Speaker 2>supports your argument.</v>

724
00:34:36.010 --> 00:34:38.830
<v Speaker 2>Did you ever consider,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm arguing against herself.</v>

725
00:34:39.070 --> 00:34:39.890
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

726
00:34:39.910 --> 00:34:41.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in fact the book is,</v>

727
00:34:42.010 --> 00:34:47.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the book is written as an argument </v>

728
00:34:47.010 --> 00:34:47.080
<v Speaker 2>against the standard narrative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

729
00:34:47.130 --> 00:34:48.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had to present this.</v>

730
00:34:48.371 --> 00:34:50.500
<v Speaker 2>What is the standard narrative?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who believes this?</v>

731
00:34:50.501 --> 00:34:55.501
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who thinks that people evolve to as </v>

732
00:34:55.501 --> 00:34:55.501
<v Speaker 2>monogamous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we quote quite heavily from those</v>

733
00:34:55.501 --> 00:34:56.960
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

734
00:34:57.010 --> 00:34:58.360
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing is I,</v>

735
00:34:58.530 --> 00:35:00.590
<v Speaker 2>and I really appreciated your email and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

736
00:35:01.020 --> 00:35:06.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't need to talk about this at any </v>

737
00:35:06.020 --> 00:35:08.320
<v Speaker 2>length,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not your job to defend the book</v>

738
00:35:08.410 --> 00:35:11.170
<v Speaker 2>and it's not even my job really to </v>
<v Speaker 2>defend the book.</v>

739
00:35:11.171 --> 00:35:13.270
<v Speaker 2>I think once a book is out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's out.</v>

740
00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:14.500
<v Speaker 2>The book is there,</v>

741
00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:17.210
<v Speaker 6>but isn't it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's not just the book,</v>

742
00:35:17.390 --> 00:35:22.390
<v Speaker 6>it's when someone goes hard on a book,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's not about you as well is expression</v>

743
00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:26.550
<v Speaker 6>of,</v>
<v Speaker 6>of your</v>

744
00:35:26.550 --> 00:35:27.180
<v Speaker 2>work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But see,</v>

745
00:35:27.181 --> 00:35:31.080
<v Speaker 2>that's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't accept that association.</v>

746
00:35:31.081 --> 00:35:34.320
<v Speaker 2>And so if somebody wants to critique the</v>
<v Speaker 2>book,</v>

747
00:35:34.321 --> 00:35:36.420
<v Speaker 2>that's totally cool and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and like,</v>

748
00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:41.520
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are there things that we may have </v>

749
00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:42.630
<v Speaker 2>misunderstood?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course are the things we left out.</v>

750
00:35:42.631 --> 00:35:44.080
<v Speaker 2>Of course there are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

751
00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:47.370
<v Speaker 2>mistakes of course you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're human.</v>

752
00:35:47.371 --> 00:35:52.371
<v Speaker 2>You made it right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are hundreds of citations in that </v>

753
00:35:52.371 --> 00:35:52.371
<v Speaker 2>book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

754
00:35:52.371 --> 00:35:53.790
<v Speaker 2>if somebody says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as people have like,</v>

755
00:35:53.791 --> 00:35:54.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

756
00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:55.860
<v Speaker 2>Chris Ryan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

757
00:35:56.040 --> 00:36:01.040
<v Speaker 2>deliberately misrepresented the science </v>
<v Speaker 2>or doesn't understand the first thing </v>

758
00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:05.361
<v Speaker 2>about evolution or whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't engage because the </v>

759
00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:12.520
<v Speaker 2>emotional cycle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we were saying earlier about </v>

760
00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:14.040
<v Speaker 2>comments online,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think people will react to sex at dawn</v>

761
00:36:14.041 --> 00:36:18.330
<v Speaker 2>very emotionally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so if they're reacting emotionally,</v>

762
00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:23.360
<v Speaker 2>there's no point in me engaging with </v>
<v Speaker 2>them because they're expressing some </v>

763
00:36:23.910 --> 00:36:28.910
<v Speaker 2>something that's going on in their lives</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I don't know anything about and I </v>

764
00:36:28.910 --> 00:36:28.910
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're suffering in some way.</v>

765
00:36:28.910 --> 00:36:31.770
<v Speaker 2>I'm not talking about Weinstein or </v>
<v Speaker 2>anybody specifically,</v>

766
00:36:32.310 --> 00:36:36.840
<v Speaker 2>but there's an emotional reason to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>that kind of reaction.</v>

767
00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:40.080
<v Speaker 2>Whereas if somebody says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look on page 72,</v>

768
00:36:40.081 --> 00:36:45.081
<v Speaker 2>you said that a Benobos are the only ape</v>
<v Speaker 2>that does this and the actually gibbons </v>

769
00:36:45.081 --> 00:36:46.200
<v Speaker 2>do it as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

770
00:36:46.201 --> 00:36:47.810
<v Speaker 2>We can talk about that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

771
00:36:47.811 --> 00:36:49.170
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's factual.</v>

772
00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:50.970
<v Speaker 2>So when people say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

773
00:36:50.971 --> 00:36:51.990
<v Speaker 2>it's cherry picked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

774
00:36:51.991 --> 00:36:54.030
<v Speaker 2>which cherries?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are you talking about?</v>

775
00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:58.530
<v Speaker 2>Specific thing and what's wrong with it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Instead of saying it's cherry picking is</v>

776
00:36:58.531 --> 00:37:01.590
<v Speaker 2>vast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>General critic critique of the book.</v>

777
00:37:02.530 --> 00:37:04.740
<v Speaker 2>And if it gets about me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

778
00:37:04.741 --> 00:37:06.630
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's because he wants to get laid,</v>

779
00:37:06.631 --> 00:37:10.800
<v Speaker 2>or one of the arguments was that it </v>
<v Speaker 2>would be a good book to write.</v>

780
00:37:10.801 --> 00:37:15.801
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember if he said or if his </v>

781
00:37:15.801 --> 00:37:15.801
<v Speaker 2>wife said it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'd be a good book.</v>

782
00:37:15.801 --> 00:37:15.840
<v Speaker 2>And I really loved those two.</v>

783
00:37:15.990 --> 00:37:17.250
<v Speaker 2>They're great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're cool.</v>

784
00:37:17.610 --> 00:37:19.190
<v Speaker 2>I just think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

785
00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:24.680
<v Speaker 2>when it comes to monogamy and sexuality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people have a notion in their head and </v>

786
00:37:25.081 --> 00:37:30.081
<v Speaker 2>that notion almost always aligns with </v>
<v Speaker 2>how they're living their life or how </v>

787
00:37:30.081 --> 00:37:31.010
<v Speaker 2>they wish they were living their lives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

788
00:37:31.090 --> 00:37:32.100
<v Speaker 2>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>

789
00:37:32.101 --> 00:37:34.770
<v Speaker 2>we're not talking about specific people </v>
<v Speaker 2>or I've never met them.</v>

790
00:37:34.771 --> 00:37:37.380
<v Speaker 2>I know they're a great couple.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're wonderful people.</v>

791
00:37:37.381 --> 00:37:42.381
<v Speaker 2>But I mean there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something about the subject of </v>

792
00:37:42.381 --> 00:37:42.570
<v Speaker 2>your book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I told you this before,</v>

793
00:37:42.571 --> 00:37:44.940
<v Speaker 2>without naming any names.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My friend brought your book home and his</v>

794
00:37:44.941 --> 00:37:47.220
<v Speaker 2>wife threw it away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

795
00:37:47.221 --> 00:37:50.960
<v Speaker 2>You and I talked about that on the very </v>
<v Speaker 2>first podcast actually.</v>

796
00:37:50.990 --> 00:37:54.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've run into this a lot,</v>

797
00:37:54.300 --> 00:37:59.300
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can imagine cocktail parties with </v>

798
00:37:59.300 --> 00:38:01.311
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can get awkward very quickly for </v>

799
00:38:01.311 --> 00:38:01.311
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

800
00:38:01.311 --> 00:38:01.311
<v Speaker 2>cause people ask,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh wait,</v>

801
00:38:01.311 --> 00:38:01.360
<v Speaker 2>you're the guy who.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

802
00:38:01.670 --> 00:38:06.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then often you'll see some people </v>

803
00:38:06.670 --> 00:38:07.710
<v Speaker 2>are very eager to hear about it and talk</v>
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>

804
00:38:07.780 --> 00:38:10.950
<v Speaker 2>Other people are just steams coming out </v>
<v Speaker 2>of their ears.</v>

805
00:38:11.330 --> 00:38:12.390
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

806
00:38:12.780 --> 00:38:17.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people are in relationships </v>

807
00:38:17.780 --> 00:38:20.720
<v Speaker 2>that they're trying to make fit into </v>
<v Speaker 2>what they believe is the right way to </v>

808
00:38:22.141 --> 00:38:24.810
<v Speaker 2>have a relationship and often it just </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't.</v>

809
00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:30.200
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so there's a lot of shame and regret</v>

810
00:38:31.831 --> 00:38:35.500
<v Speaker 2>and resentment and all kinds of negative</v>
<v Speaker 2>energy around that.</v>

811
00:38:35.830 --> 00:38:36.100
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

812
00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:41.100
<v Speaker 3>so any discussion where you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well maybe that's not actually the way </v>

813
00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:46.680
<v Speaker 3>it's meant to work for some people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's an incredibly liberating message </v>

814
00:38:46.870 --> 00:38:49.060
<v Speaker 3>for other people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's extremely threatening.</v>

815
00:38:49.090 --> 00:38:51.160
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I understand that.</v>

816
00:38:51.161 --> 00:38:52.200
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

817
00:38:52.330 --> 00:38:56.500
<v Speaker 3>so I've become very emotionally sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>separate from the book.</v>

818
00:38:56.740 --> 00:39:00.820
<v Speaker 3>It's out there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it stands or not based on its merits.</v>

819
00:39:01.510 --> 00:39:03.520
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When people get all riled up,</v>

820
00:39:03.521 --> 00:39:05.080
<v Speaker 3>I've learned to just be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

821
00:39:05.081 --> 00:39:06.610
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's fine.</v>

822
00:39:06.611 --> 00:39:09.160
<v Speaker 3>That's between you and the book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a very healthy approach.</v>

823
00:39:09.430 --> 00:39:10.870
<v Speaker 3>Good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>

824
00:39:10.990 --> 00:39:14.410
<v Speaker 3>to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it seems like people that get most upset</v>

825
00:39:14.411 --> 00:39:18.220
<v Speaker 3>about it don't get most upset about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For rational reason.</v>

826
00:39:18.430 --> 00:39:21.010
<v Speaker 3>They get upset about it because it </v>
<v Speaker 3>challenges the way they live their life.</v>

827
00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:21.610
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's.</v>

828
00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:24.520
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's what I was saying about </v>
<v Speaker 3>the gay preachers and stuff.</v>

829
00:39:24.521 --> 00:39:27.660
<v Speaker 3>It's like if you're getting that upset,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's about you,</v>

830
00:39:27.661 --> 00:39:27.970
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

831
00:39:27.970 --> 00:39:29.170
<v Speaker 3>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

832
00:39:29.171 --> 00:39:30.970
<v Speaker 3>if he disagreed with it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then disagree with it.</v>

833
00:39:30.971 --> 00:39:33.820
<v Speaker 3>That's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is out gay preachers,</v>

834
00:39:34.540 --> 00:39:38.200
<v Speaker 3>people who love Jesus and are also gay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't do that.</v>

835
00:39:38.201 --> 00:39:43.201
<v Speaker 3>You can't figure that out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How can this guy can start a whole </v>

836
00:39:43.201 --> 00:39:45.691
<v Speaker 3>fucking call it in Australia and tell </v>
<v Speaker 3>people about Jesus and his girlfriend's </v>

837
00:39:45.691 --> 00:39:48.310
<v Speaker 3>Mary and you guys can't get together and</v>
<v Speaker 3>form yourself a nice gay church.</v>

838
00:39:48.630 --> 00:39:50.050
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do they have them that I don't know.</v>

839
00:39:50.070 --> 00:39:53.110
<v Speaker 3>The Vatican Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

840
00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:55.510
<v Speaker 3>have you heard all this stuff going on </v>
<v Speaker 3>in Italy?</v>

841
00:39:56.230 --> 00:39:58.960
<v Speaker 3>They've got all their sex parties or </v>
<v Speaker 3>their own country.</v>

842
00:39:58.961 --> 00:40:03.961
<v Speaker 3>Do you know when I was there when you </v>
<v Speaker 3>just walk around the Vatican and just </v>

843
00:40:05.111 --> 00:40:10.111
<v Speaker 3>see the vast amount of pilfered riches </v>
<v Speaker 3>that are all just sucked out by an </v>

844
00:40:11.201 --> 00:40:12.280
<v Speaker 3>ideology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

845
00:40:12.281 --> 00:40:14.290
<v Speaker 3>that's really what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That church,</v>

846
00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:17.230
<v Speaker 3>that whatever the fuck you want to call </v>
<v Speaker 3>it a religion,</v>

847
00:40:17.530 --> 00:40:20.770
<v Speaker 3>they just acquired an ungodly amount of </v>
<v Speaker 3>wealth.</v>

848
00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:23.260
<v Speaker 3>Literally ungodly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ungodly.</v>

849
00:40:23.300 --> 00:40:25.090
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking stunning.</v>

850
00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:27.430
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus is all about living in poverty and</v>

851
00:40:27.431 --> 00:40:32.431
<v Speaker 3>hanging out with sex workers and these </v>
<v Speaker 3>guys are like just lavish wealth and </v>

852
00:40:32.431 --> 00:40:34.750
<v Speaker 3>it's crazy because if Jesus came back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the first thing he'd say,</v>

853
00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:36.460
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck have you guys done?</v>

854
00:40:36.510 --> 00:40:37.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what have you done?</v>

855
00:40:38.380 --> 00:40:41.470
<v Speaker 3>Look at these gigantic places that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>built and I told you guys,</v>

856
00:40:41.471 --> 00:40:43.210
<v Speaker 3>you don't even have to be anywhere for </v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

857
00:40:43.750 --> 00:40:48.750
<v Speaker 3>You don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't need to have some ornate </v>

858
00:40:48.750 --> 00:40:51.540
<v Speaker 3>temple with stain glass windows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it took craftsman like St Peter's </v>

859
00:40:51.761 --> 00:40:53.170
<v Speaker 3>Basilica.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

860
00:40:53.410 --> 00:40:58.410
<v Speaker 3>is it a shock that that is probably one </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the most stunning things that I've </v>

861
00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:04.920
<v Speaker 3>ever seen in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like one of the most beautiful works of </v>

862
00:41:04.920 --> 00:41:07.771
<v Speaker 3>art,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yet was created for this religion that </v>

863
00:41:07.961 --> 00:41:12.961
<v Speaker 3>most likely the people that were living </v>
<v Speaker 3>in that day were probably like </v>

864
00:41:12.961 --> 00:41:17.371
<v Speaker 3>worshiping these people that were </v>
<v Speaker 3>running this thing because if they were </v>

865
00:41:17.371 --> 00:41:19.780
<v Speaker 3>dating themselves and they needed them </v>
<v Speaker 3>to have the biggest,</v>

866
00:41:19.781 --> 00:41:24.781
<v Speaker 3>craziest building that impressed the </v>
<v Speaker 3>rubes right when they come into the </v>

867
00:41:24.781 --> 00:41:26.200
<v Speaker 3>country side and they walk into a </v>
<v Speaker 3>cathedral like,</v>

868
00:41:26.390 --> 00:41:29.140
<v Speaker 3>holy fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the impact that it has on us.</v>

869
00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:31.390
<v Speaker 3>You can't understate it still.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

870
00:41:31.450 --> 00:41:32.030
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there,</v>

871
00:41:32.031 --> 00:41:33.980
<v Speaker 3>there are churches in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would go into</v>

872
00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:35.510
<v Speaker 6>it and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm a pagan,</v>

873
00:41:35.511 --> 00:41:38.690
<v Speaker 6>but just go in there and just feel the </v>
<v Speaker 6>space.</v>

874
00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:39.710
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>just feel it.</v>

875
00:41:39.950 --> 00:41:41.930
<v Speaker 6>The distance you just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>

876
00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:44.690
<v Speaker 6>your body knows how big it is or can </v>
<v Speaker 6>you.</v>

877
00:41:44.740 --> 00:41:46.370
<v Speaker 6>It's like when you walk into an airplane</v>
<v Speaker 6>hangar,</v>

878
00:41:46.780 --> 00:41:47.770
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

879
00:41:48.070 --> 00:41:49.080
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

880
00:41:49.230 --> 00:41:52.970
<v Speaker 6>it's not something you really can't </v>
<v Speaker 6>overemphasize how crazy it is.</v>

881
00:41:53.210 --> 00:41:55.730
<v Speaker 6>Like these people built this without </v>
<v Speaker 6>power tools.</v>

882
00:41:56.060 --> 00:42:01.060
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know what kind of fucking </v>

883
00:42:01.060 --> 00:42:01.060
<v Speaker 6>ladders they used,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but whatever they did it.</v>

884
00:42:01.060 --> 00:42:02.180
<v Speaker 6>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Fuck man.</v>

885
00:42:02.530 --> 00:42:03.770
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's just crazy.</v>

886
00:42:03.771 --> 00:42:07.280
<v Speaker 6>You walk around that place,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you can't believe how ornate it is,</v>

887
00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:10.190
<v Speaker 6>but at the same time this was happening.</v>
<v Speaker 6>People were starving,</v>

888
00:42:11.270 --> 00:42:12.950
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>guaranteed.</v>

889
00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:17.840
<v Speaker 6>Like how old is that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Fifteen hundred 15.</v>

890
00:42:17.841 --> 00:42:18.290
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>six.</v>

891
00:42:18.620 --> 00:42:21.020
<v Speaker 6>How well do you think everybody was </v>
<v Speaker 6>doing financially in 15?</v>

892
00:42:21.021 --> 00:42:21.440
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>six.</v>

893
00:42:21.441 --> 00:42:22.880
<v Speaker 6>I bet.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Pretty fucking shitty.</v>

894
00:42:23.930 --> 00:42:28.930
<v Speaker 6>I bet everybody that lived around that </v>
<v Speaker 6>place suffered and these motherfuckers </v>

895
00:42:28.930 --> 00:42:30.470
<v Speaker 6>were building these crazy places.</v>

896
00:42:30.740 --> 00:42:34.610
<v Speaker 6>They have an obelisk in this whole place</v>
<v Speaker 6>where you're these images right here.</v>

897
00:42:34.611 --> 00:42:36.230
<v Speaker 6>Where's Sean from?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Egypt?</v>

898
00:42:36.590 --> 00:42:40.190
<v Speaker 6>This massive stone obelisk from Egypt </v>
<v Speaker 6>and I was like,</v>

899
00:42:40.191 --> 00:42:42.650
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how the fuck did they get that there?</v>

900
00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:45.920
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It shows you how cheap labor was.</v>

901
00:42:46.010 --> 00:42:46.720
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>do.</v>

902
00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:49.070
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You could hire people for a lifetime,</v>

903
00:42:49.071 --> 00:42:50.120
<v Speaker 6>for a pittance,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>

904
00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:52.530
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Really skilled artisans down.</v>

905
00:42:52.700 --> 00:42:53.880
<v Speaker 6>They couldn't go anywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

906
00:42:55.160 --> 00:42:58.010
<v Speaker 6>What they did in that place,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean the Vatican is just a.</v>

907
00:42:58.340 --> 00:43:03.340
<v Speaker 6>it's a stunning place,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like way more so than I thought it was </v>

908
00:43:03.340 --> 00:43:03.340
<v Speaker 6>going to.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Have you been to Spain?</v>

909
00:43:03.340 --> 00:43:04.310
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I have not looked at that.</v>

910
00:43:04.430 --> 00:43:05.720
<v Speaker 6>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 6>look at that.</v>

911
00:43:08.170 --> 00:43:09.860
<v Speaker 6>That's what is that Jamie?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What are we looking at?</v>

912
00:43:10.430 --> 00:43:13.370
<v Speaker 6>Is that the roof?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just St Peter's Basilica.</v>

913
00:43:13.850 --> 00:43:17.600
<v Speaker 6>Look at the fucking carving and </v>
<v Speaker 6>everything and I'm telling you these.</v>

914
00:43:17.660 --> 00:43:22.660
<v Speaker 6>It's one of those things like you were </v>
<v Speaker 6>talking about how you have to see </v>

915
00:43:22.660 --> 00:43:23.780
<v Speaker 6>another culture in per person owner to </v>
<v Speaker 6>really appreciate it.</v>

916
00:43:24.260 --> 00:43:27.800
<v Speaker 6>I think that's the same with this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>St Peter's basilica is one of those ones</v>

917
00:43:27.801 --> 00:43:28.700
<v Speaker 6>when you're there,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

918
00:43:28.701 --> 00:43:30.650
<v Speaker 6>look how little those people are walking</v>
<v Speaker 6>around down there.</v>

919
00:43:30.830 --> 00:43:32.910
<v Speaker 6>See the top of their heads.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's it.</v>

920
00:43:33.190 --> 00:43:34.490
<v Speaker 6>Fucking places.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Giant,</v>

921
00:43:35.510 --> 00:43:37.970
<v Speaker 6>beautiful light coming through.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're unbelievable.</v>

922
00:43:38.030 --> 00:43:38.510
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

923
00:43:38.620 --> 00:43:41.150
<v Speaker 6>it's one of those game changers when you</v>
<v Speaker 6>leave,</v>

924
00:43:41.160 --> 00:43:46.160
<v Speaker 6>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>to me it was way more impressive than </v>

925
00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:46.370
<v Speaker 6>the calcium.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Calcium is very impressive,</v>

926
00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:48.830
<v Speaker 6>but it wasn't as impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What's not intact,</v>

927
00:43:49.870 --> 00:43:51.740
<v Speaker 6>but it's not even that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's just like what it is,</v>

928
00:43:51.980 --> 00:43:53.450
<v Speaker 6>what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>just craziness.</v>

929
00:43:53.450 --> 00:43:57.110
<v Speaker 6>He's fucking impressive thing was the </v>
<v Speaker 6>elevator complex.</v>

930
00:43:57.230 --> 00:44:01.340
<v Speaker 6>The dates set up the animals up from the</v>
<v Speaker 6>floor like that is fucking nuts,</v>

931
00:44:01.341 --> 00:44:06.341
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do you ever think about the coliseum </v>

932
00:44:06.341 --> 00:44:08.501
<v Speaker 6>when you're doing UFC commentary and </v>
<v Speaker 6>it's kind of like this modern a little </v>

933
00:44:08.501 --> 00:44:08.501
<v Speaker 6>bit,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

934
00:44:08.501 --> 00:44:12.910
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's definitely a big violent </v>

935
00:44:12.910 --> 00:44:15.020
<v Speaker 6>distraction from everyday life that </v>
<v Speaker 6>people really look forward to and enjoy,</v>

936
00:44:15.460 --> 00:44:17.450
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>for like entertainment value.</v>

937
00:44:17.780 --> 00:44:22.780
<v Speaker 6>I mean it says it's primal as you can </v>
<v Speaker 6>get without anybody really dying,</v>

938
00:44:22.990 --> 00:44:24.680
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean that's most of the time.</v>

939
00:44:24.681 --> 00:44:28.190
<v Speaker 6>Most of the time,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean no one has in the UFC ever,</v>

940
00:44:28.670 --> 00:44:33.670
<v Speaker 6>but it's because they have the most </v>
<v Speaker 6>rules and because they have the best </v>

941
00:44:34.801 --> 00:44:37.500
<v Speaker 6>medical staff and the best referees and </v>
<v Speaker 6>all that stuff,</v>

942
00:44:37.501 --> 00:44:41.820
<v Speaker 6>but it's also just luck because like </v>
<v Speaker 6>people can die sparring.</v>

943
00:44:41.910 --> 00:44:43.080
<v Speaker 6>It happens.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What</v>

944
00:44:43.340 --> 00:44:48.340
<v Speaker 4>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're in a choke hold and you don't </v>

945
00:44:48.340 --> 00:44:48.340
<v Speaker 4>tap out,</v>

946
00:44:48.340 --> 00:44:50.110
<v Speaker 6>you just go unconscious and then when </v>
<v Speaker 6>they and then you'll be all right.</v>

947
00:44:50.130 --> 00:44:55.130
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you'd be fine and you can feel when </v>

948
00:44:55.130 --> 00:44:55.130
<v Speaker 6>someone goes unconscious,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the muscles relax.</v>

949
00:44:55.130 --> 00:44:55.800
<v Speaker 6>They just slump,</v>
<v Speaker 6>slumping the referee.</v>

950
00:44:55.980 --> 00:44:57.720
<v Speaker 6>Sometimes the referee like pickup and </v>
<v Speaker 6>arm,</v>

951
00:44:57.970 --> 00:45:01.350
<v Speaker 6>the old progressing move like they would</v>
<v Speaker 6>check to see if the guy was still awake.</v>

952
00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:05.900
<v Speaker 6>I didn't pick the arm and the crowd </v>
<v Speaker 6>would go back.</v>

953
00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:07.560
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's about to make us come back.</v>

954
00:45:07.850 --> 00:45:09.680
<v Speaker 6>But they do do that sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Referee.</v>

955
00:45:09.710 --> 00:45:12.390
<v Speaker 6>I've seen referees pick a guy's arm up,</v>
<v Speaker 6>see if the guy responds,</v>

956
00:45:12.450 --> 00:45:14.520
<v Speaker 6>or girl,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you have two girls get choked out bunch.</v>

957
00:45:14.900 --> 00:45:15.730
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but you know,</v>

958
00:45:15.731 --> 00:45:20.731
<v Speaker 6>people are tough.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They don't want to tap and then we'll </v>

959
00:45:20.731 --> 00:45:20.731
<v Speaker 6>wind up going to sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Holly Holm,</v>

960
00:45:20.731 --> 00:45:20.731
<v Speaker 6>when she fought me,</v>
<v Speaker 6>she tate,</v>

961
00:45:20.731 --> 00:45:25.730
<v Speaker 6>Misha Tate,</v>
<v Speaker 6>choked or unconscious and before holly </v>

962
00:45:25.730 --> 00:45:26.370
<v Speaker 6>went out she was throwing punches in the</v>
<v Speaker 6>air and she went unconscious.</v>

963
00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:29.610
<v Speaker 6>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was crazy.</v>

964
00:45:29.611 --> 00:45:31.040
<v Speaker 6>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it was prime.</v>

965
00:45:31.041 --> 00:45:33.390
<v Speaker 6>Most drownings like watching someone </v>
<v Speaker 6>drown,</v>

966
00:45:33.750 --> 00:45:34.870
<v Speaker 6>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

967
00:45:35.010 --> 00:45:37.360
<v Speaker 6>so it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

968
00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:41.970
<v Speaker 6>you have a preference for how you die.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Drowning drownings.</v>

969
00:45:42.060 --> 00:45:44.580
<v Speaker 6>My one of my least favorite seems like </v>
<v Speaker 6>it would suck.</v>

970
00:45:44.820 --> 00:45:45.720
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

971
00:45:45.721 --> 00:45:46.980
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

972
00:45:47.540 --> 00:45:52.540
<v Speaker 4>I have a buddy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's a big wave surfer and a like 40 </v>

973
00:45:52.540 --> 00:45:56.261
<v Speaker 4>foot waves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Shout out to kyle and he did a breath </v>

974
00:45:56.480 --> 00:45:59.390
<v Speaker 4>holding course and he can hold his </v>
<v Speaker 4>breath for five minutes.</v>

975
00:45:59.780 --> 00:46:01.250
<v Speaker 4>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because he goes,</v>

976
00:46:01.350 --> 00:46:02.810
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you get caught in one of those waves,</v>

977
00:46:02.811 --> 00:46:05.480
<v Speaker 4>you're like down in the deep for a long </v>
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

978
00:46:08.460 --> 00:46:09.590
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some really interesting.</v>

979
00:46:09.591 --> 00:46:14.591
<v Speaker 4>He was telling me some really </v>
<v Speaker 4>interesting things like when a human </v>

980
00:46:14.591 --> 00:46:17.150
<v Speaker 4>being puts its face in the water,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all sorts of physiological changes start</v>

981
00:46:17.151 --> 00:46:22.151
<v Speaker 4>happening.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your metabolism immediately slows way </v>

982
00:46:22.151 --> 00:46:25.610
<v Speaker 4>down your oxygen consumption cuts way </v>
<v Speaker 4>back just automatically.</v>

983
00:46:25.611 --> 00:46:30.611
<v Speaker 4>We've got a lot of seemingly </v>
<v Speaker 4>evolutionary adaptations to living in </v>

984
00:46:30.611 --> 00:46:31.850
<v Speaker 4>the water.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

985
00:46:31.851 --> 00:46:32.560
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever heard</v>

986
00:46:32.620 --> 00:46:36.280
<v Speaker 6>that aquatic ape theory?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Does that make any sense?</v>

987
00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:41.600
<v Speaker 6>Does it fit citi?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Someone should have already known that </v>

988
00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:41.600
<v Speaker 6>already.</v>

989
00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:43.090
<v Speaker 4>It makes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here's what it does in my opinion.</v>

990
00:46:43.470 --> 00:46:44.670
<v Speaker 4>We should explain it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

991
00:46:44.840 --> 00:46:49.060
<v Speaker 4>So the idea is I first read about it in </v>
<v Speaker 4>a book by Buckminster Fuller,</v>

992
00:46:49.061 --> 00:46:51.120
<v Speaker 4>actually.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Great.</v>

993
00:46:51.160 --> 00:46:52.300
<v Speaker 4>You know about him?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

994
00:46:52.301 --> 00:46:53.800
<v Speaker 4>Genius.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

995
00:46:53.920 --> 00:46:58.920
<v Speaker 4>the idea is that there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>according to the people who support this</v>

996
00:46:58.991 --> 00:47:03.991
<v Speaker 4>theory,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was a period in human evolution </v>

997
00:47:03.991 --> 00:47:06.211
<v Speaker 4>where our ancestors lived in title </v>
<v Speaker 4>areas,</v>

998
00:47:06.280 --> 00:47:10.630
<v Speaker 4>so they spend most of their time in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>water that was about body temperature.</v>

999
00:47:10.631 --> 00:47:15.631
<v Speaker 4>So it was comfortable and it was shallow</v>
<v Speaker 4>enough that they weren't worried about </v>

1000
00:47:16.121 --> 00:47:21.121
<v Speaker 4>sharks coming in and deep enough that </v>
<v Speaker 4>leopards and other predators from the </v>

1001
00:47:21.121 --> 00:47:23.410
<v Speaker 4>land couldn't get at them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it was safe in that respect.</v>

1002
00:47:23.770 --> 00:47:28.770
<v Speaker 4>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have a great sight lines so you can </v>

1003
00:47:28.770 --> 00:47:31.531
<v Speaker 4>see if something's coming from a long </v>
<v Speaker 4>way off and there's lots of there lots </v>

1004
00:47:31.531 --> 00:47:31.531
<v Speaker 4>of mollusks</v>

1005
00:47:31.531 --> 00:47:35.260
<v Speaker 2>and fish and you can net and so it sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>of made sense that they would be there.</v>

1006
00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:40.870
<v Speaker 2>And so we have these physiological </v>
<v Speaker 2>adaptations for aquatic living.</v>

1007
00:47:40.871 --> 00:47:44.590
<v Speaker 2>Like for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>human infants are the only ape.</v>

1008
00:47:44.591 --> 00:47:45.700
<v Speaker 2>Certainly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

1009
00:47:45.730 --> 00:47:50.730
<v Speaker 2>primary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably the only primates that know to </v>

1010
00:47:50.730 --> 00:47:51.790
<v Speaker 2>hold their water or hold their breath </v>
<v Speaker 2>underwater.</v>

1011
00:47:51.810 --> 00:47:52.930
<v Speaker 2>Mm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like that.</v>

1012
00:47:52.931 --> 00:47:54.700
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A nirvana album.</v>

1013
00:47:54.701 --> 00:47:59.701
<v Speaker 2>Cover the baby.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you take a baby and dropped it in </v>

1014
00:47:59.701 --> 00:48:02.310
<v Speaker 2>water and it holds its breath and </v>
<v Speaker 2>breathe and die.</v>

1015
00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:03.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoops.</v>

1016
00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:05.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gemstone can't even swim.</v>

1017
00:48:05.710 --> 00:48:06.880
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1018
00:48:06.881 --> 00:48:11.881
<v Speaker 2>there's that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's the fact that babies are really </v>

1019
00:48:11.881 --> 00:48:11.881
<v Speaker 2>fat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they flood.</v>

1020
00:48:11.881 --> 00:48:13.000
<v Speaker 2>You can't teach chimps to swim?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1021
00:48:13.090 --> 00:48:16.060
<v Speaker 2>And also chimps don't have enough body </v>
<v Speaker 2>fat to be buoyant.</v>

1022
00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:18.500
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're super core.</v>

1023
00:48:18.600 --> 00:48:23.600
<v Speaker 2>Did steal their bodies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know they could never teach </v>

1024
00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:24.130
<v Speaker 2>them to swim.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That makes sense to,</v>

1025
00:48:24.140 --> 00:48:25.060
<v Speaker 2>but they're so smart.</v>

1026
00:48:25.480 --> 00:48:26.790
<v Speaker 2>I guess they just can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

1027
00:48:27.310 --> 00:48:28.840
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yes,</v>

1028
00:48:28.900 --> 00:48:33.900
<v Speaker 2>if you see lots of contemporary zoos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have the chimps surrounded by a </v>

1029
00:48:33.900 --> 00:48:36.760
<v Speaker 2>moat right across the moat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1030
00:48:36.761 --> 00:48:38.860
<v Speaker 2>What a bummer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll wait in water.</v>

1031
00:48:38.950 --> 00:48:42.720
<v Speaker 2>I've seen chimps waiting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1032
00:48:42.721 --> 00:48:47.721
<v Speaker 2>maybe then there's also the connection </v>
<v Speaker 2>between eating fish and fish oil and </v>

1033
00:48:48.071 --> 00:48:49.300
<v Speaker 2>brain health.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1034
00:48:49.640 --> 00:48:52.940
<v Speaker 2>And it was a very strong correlation </v>
<v Speaker 2>between fish oil and brainhealth.</v>

1035
00:48:53.090 --> 00:48:58.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it could be related to fatty acid </v>

1036
00:48:58.090 --> 00:49:01.020
<v Speaker 2>development and also you would have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be clever to try to dive into the water </v>

1037
00:49:01.991 --> 00:49:06.040
<v Speaker 2>to go after those things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The smarter ones would probably survive,</v>

1038
00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:11.160
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even the nostrils like a nostrils come </v>

1039
00:49:11.160 --> 00:49:13.390
<v Speaker 2>straight out of the face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the idea of our nostrils facing down</v>

1040
00:49:13.391 --> 00:49:17.020
<v Speaker 2>is related to the aquatic wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A explanation.</v>

1041
00:49:17.021 --> 00:49:21.070
<v Speaker 2>The oil glands that we have on our heads</v>
<v Speaker 2>and faces and shoulders that,</v>

1042
00:49:21.420 --> 00:49:24.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause acne and stuff and teenagers,</v>

1043
00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:29.240
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's for protection from the sun </v>

1044
00:49:29.240 --> 00:49:29.240
<v Speaker 2>apparently.</v>

1045
00:49:29.240 --> 00:49:31.990
<v Speaker 2>So there are lots of adaptations that </v>
<v Speaker 2>seem to fit into this interpretation,</v>

1046
00:49:32.290 --> 00:49:37.290
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lots of sort of mainstream evolutionary </v>

1047
00:49:37.290 --> 00:49:37.990
<v Speaker 2>theorists would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well wait a minute,</v>

1048
00:49:37.991 --> 00:49:42.991
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are other adaptations we don't </v>

1049
00:49:42.991 --> 00:49:43.240
<v Speaker 2>have and that we would have if that had </v>
<v Speaker 2>been the case.</v>

1050
00:49:43.241 --> 00:49:46.390
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's controversial at best.</v>

1051
00:49:46.420 --> 00:49:49.300
<v Speaker 2>Part of it was also the theory that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>human brain,</v>

1052
00:49:49.330 --> 00:49:54.330
<v Speaker 2>in order for us to be born vaginally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the brain could only be so big before </v>

1053
00:49:54.330 --> 00:49:55.520
<v Speaker 2>the kid was born.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

1054
00:49:57.180 --> 00:49:57.740
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1055
00:49:57.760 --> 00:50:01.030
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's the explanation for why </v>
<v Speaker 2>humans are born helpless.</v>

1056
00:50:01.450 --> 00:50:06.450
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what I'm saying is that we really </v>

1057
00:50:06.450 --> 00:50:06.450
<v Speaker 2>can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The brain can't get any bigger,</v>

1058
00:50:06.450 --> 00:50:07.810
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Vaginal canal,</v>

1059
00:50:07.811 --> 00:50:10.930
<v Speaker 2>unless our dicks get bigger and the is </v>
<v Speaker 2>get bigger as well.</v>

1060
00:50:11.320 --> 00:50:13.720
<v Speaker 2>I still hold bit about that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about Dick Pills,</v>

1061
00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:17.050
<v Speaker 2>but if they're really word Dick Pills,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one's stopping at one.</v>

1062
00:50:18.550 --> 00:50:20.140
<v Speaker 2>Like what's the dosage?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1063
00:50:20.290 --> 00:50:23.350
<v Speaker 2>how much gives me a stroke?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to take one less than that.</v>

1064
00:50:23.510 --> 00:50:28.510
<v Speaker 2>All the fucking dice or it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the idea would that be every dude's </v>

1065
00:50:28.510 --> 00:50:28.510
<v Speaker 2>Dick would just</v>

1066
00:50:28.510 --> 00:50:30.020
<v Speaker 3>become a super dick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And every woman will be,</v>

1067
00:50:30.260 --> 00:50:30.860
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she.</v>

1068
00:50:31.370 --> 00:50:34.100
<v Speaker 3>It was a joke about flying squirrel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pussy people.</v>

1069
00:50:34.101 --> 00:50:36.620
<v Speaker 3>They would just jump dudes with big </v>
<v Speaker 3>dicks and shopping carts.</v>

1070
00:50:36.770 --> 00:50:38.360
<v Speaker 3>We chase these girls to the edge of </v>
<v Speaker 3>cliffs.</v>

1071
00:50:38.361 --> 00:50:42.350
<v Speaker 3>The women would leap off with their </v>
<v Speaker 3>vaginas.</v>

1072
00:50:42.800 --> 00:50:46.040
<v Speaker 3>Bonnie would have to more to have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>change for the big Dick Pills,</v>

1073
00:50:46.130 --> 00:50:51.130
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It does seem like if pew ones are going </v>

1074
00:50:51.130 --> 00:50:53.761
<v Speaker 3>to get smarter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if the head is going to have to get </v>

1075
00:50:53.761 --> 00:50:54.800
<v Speaker 3>larger,</v>
<v Speaker 3>does that make any sense or is that just</v>

1076
00:50:54.801 --> 00:50:59.801
<v Speaker 3>a crude way of looking at the brain?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it possible that people can get </v>

1077
00:50:59.801 --> 00:50:59.801
<v Speaker 3>smart?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if we evolved,</v>

1078
00:50:59.801 --> 00:51:01.730
<v Speaker 3>have you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If we evolved from lower hominids,</v>

1079
00:51:01.731 --> 00:51:06.731
<v Speaker 3>it's generally assumed that those lower </v>
<v Speaker 3>hominids had little brains or brains </v>

1080
00:51:06.731 --> 00:51:09.170
<v Speaker 3>than us right up until like Australia </v>
<v Speaker 3>pit tickets or something like that.</v>

1081
00:51:09.510 --> 00:51:13.640
<v Speaker 3>What really seems to matter though is </v>
<v Speaker 3>the ratio of brain size to body size,</v>

1082
00:51:14.200 --> 00:51:14.430
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1083
00:51:14.570 --> 00:51:19.570
<v Speaker 3>There are plenty of animals that have </v>
<v Speaker 3>bigger brains than us that aren't </v>

1084
00:51:19.570 --> 00:51:22.040
<v Speaker 3>obviously aren't smarter than us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like elephant elephants,</v>

1085
00:51:22.041 --> 00:51:23.960
<v Speaker 3>blue whales,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blue whale brains.</v>

1086
00:51:23.961 --> 00:51:28.961
<v Speaker 3>Probably the size of this room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do we know if elephants are fucking </v>

1087
00:51:28.961 --> 00:51:31.571
<v Speaker 3>super smart because isn't the thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>about intelligence is not just like </v>

1088
00:51:31.571 --> 00:51:33.650
<v Speaker 3>there's communication between elephants </v>
<v Speaker 3>for sure,</v>

1089
00:51:33.800 --> 00:51:37.670
<v Speaker 3>and we know that they recognize each </v>
<v Speaker 3>other after long periods of time,</v>

1090
00:51:38.090 --> 00:51:43.090
<v Speaker 3>like 20 years apart,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they get together and they see each </v>

1091
00:51:43.090 --> 00:51:43.090
<v Speaker 3>other and recognize each other </v>
<v Speaker 3>instantly.</v>

1092
00:51:43.090 --> 00:51:43.090
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's a,</v>

1093
00:51:43.090 --> 00:51:45.200
<v Speaker 3>there's an intelligence that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what we judge it,</v>

1094
00:51:45.250 --> 00:51:50.250
<v Speaker 3>intelligence oftentimes depends on </v>
<v Speaker 3>whether or not it can communicate with </v>

1095
00:51:50.250 --> 00:51:53.750
<v Speaker 3>you whether or not it changes its </v>
<v Speaker 3>environment builds a structure.</v>

1096
00:51:53.900 --> 00:51:54.650
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

1097
00:51:54.860 --> 00:51:59.860
<v Speaker 3>to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is one of the deepest questions in </v>

1098
00:51:59.860 --> 00:52:03.071
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you see the elephant that painted a </v>

1099
00:52:03.071 --> 00:52:03.071
<v Speaker 3>picture of it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

1100
00:52:03.071 --> 00:52:03.071
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

1101
00:52:03.071 --> 00:52:03.620
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In Thailand I think.</v>

1102
00:52:03.680 --> 00:52:04.150
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's pull.</v>

1103
00:52:04.370 --> 00:52:09.370
<v Speaker 3>Pull that up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is one of those things where you </v>

1104
00:52:09.370 --> 00:52:09.370
<v Speaker 3>go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1105
00:52:09.370 --> 00:52:09.370
<v Speaker 3>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a dog can't do that.</v>

1106
00:52:09.410 --> 00:52:14.410
<v Speaker 3>I thought you said this thing was a </v>
<v Speaker 3>smart as a dog because that's 100 times </v>

1107
00:52:14.410 --> 00:52:19.190
<v Speaker 3>they're like grey parrots that have 300 </v>
<v Speaker 3>word vocabulary or ceiling.</v>

1108
00:52:19.240 --> 00:52:20.270
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1109
00:52:20.290 --> 00:52:21.740
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't quote me on that number,</v>

1110
00:52:21.741 --> 00:52:25.550
<v Speaker 3>but Jamie can look that up there as they</v>
<v Speaker 3>can speak a whole sentence and they can.</v>

1111
00:52:25.670 --> 00:52:28.700
<v Speaker 3>And there's a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember seeing this recently,</v>

1112
00:52:28.701 --> 00:52:33.701
<v Speaker 3>there's a guy who has a border Collie </v>
<v Speaker 3>who obviously can't talk but understands</v>

1113
00:52:35.060 --> 00:52:40.060
<v Speaker 3>well over 100 words and so what he'll do</v>
<v Speaker 3>is he'll put all these different toys </v>

1114
00:52:40.060 --> 00:52:41.700
<v Speaker 3>behind a wall and he'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go get me the,</v>

1115
00:52:41.720 --> 00:52:46.720
<v Speaker 3>the yellow bunny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's like a yellow bunny or red </v>

1116
00:52:46.720 --> 00:52:46.940
<v Speaker 3>bunny in a green bunny in addition to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the hundreds of other shit.</v>

1117
00:52:47.120 --> 00:52:49.250
<v Speaker 3>And the dog will go find the yellow </v>
<v Speaker 3>bunny and bring it back.</v>

1118
00:52:49.280 --> 00:52:50.040
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1119
00:52:50.090 --> 00:52:51.050
<v Speaker 3>go get me the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1120
00:52:51.100 --> 00:52:53.300
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the green turtle and you'll go get it.</v>

1121
00:52:53.690 --> 00:52:56.510
<v Speaker 3>So the dog knows those words.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1122
00:52:56.511 --> 00:52:58.820
<v Speaker 3>And also the dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's in color.</v>

1123
00:52:59.330 --> 00:53:02.480
<v Speaker 3>I Guess Predator,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess you're seeing color think.</v>

1124
00:53:02.630 --> 00:53:07.630
<v Speaker 3>So here's the elephant painting itself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is fucking crazy because it really </v>

1125
00:53:09.801 --> 00:53:14.801
<v Speaker 3>looks like itself and this guy helps it </v>
<v Speaker 3>and gets the brush and puts it in his </v>

1126
00:53:15.051 --> 00:53:20.051
<v Speaker 3>hand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the elephant is essentially doing </v>

1127
00:53:20.051 --> 00:53:23.261
<v Speaker 3>all of this with its trunk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And just replicating itself and it's </v>

1128
00:53:23.261 --> 00:53:25.120
<v Speaker 3>proportional to its.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really good.</v>

1129
00:53:25.370 --> 00:53:28.770
<v Speaker 3>That's better than if the dude was </v>
<v Speaker 3>holding his Tusk,</v>

1130
00:53:29.550 --> 00:53:31.020
<v Speaker 3>training them to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

1131
00:53:31.080 --> 00:53:36.080
<v Speaker 3>Well I'm sure their training or is he </v>
<v Speaker 3>just pulling goes where they wanted to </v>

1132
00:53:36.200 --> 00:53:37.290
<v Speaker 3>see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at the trunk.</v>

1133
00:53:37.620 --> 00:53:42.620
<v Speaker 3>Like he's definitely holding,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but look at the trunk and look at how </v>

1134
00:53:42.620 --> 00:53:42.620
<v Speaker 3>much motion is in that thing.</v>

1135
00:53:42.620 --> 00:53:43.920
<v Speaker 3>How could he possibly be controlling </v>
<v Speaker 3>that?</v>

1136
00:53:44.970 --> 00:53:47.320
<v Speaker 3>He's definitely lifting it up and down </v>
<v Speaker 3>and helping them now.</v>

1137
00:53:48.090 --> 00:53:53.090
<v Speaker 3>But what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is they're working together like the </v>

1138
00:53:53.090 --> 00:53:54.480
<v Speaker 3>elephant knows to stay in these lines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's doing it with him.</v>

1139
00:53:56.340 --> 00:54:01.340
<v Speaker 3>You're not buying it in a mirror or </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything.</v>

1140
00:54:01.790 --> 00:54:04.320
<v Speaker 3>The hand on the Tusk is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's another one.</v>

1141
00:54:04.410 --> 00:54:09.410
<v Speaker 3>There are other ones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but let me see the other articles that </v>

1142
00:54:09.410 --> 00:54:09.600
<v Speaker 3>say that they're being trained to do it </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's cruel or something.</v>

1143
00:54:09.780 --> 00:54:10.230
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1144
00:54:10.231 --> 00:54:15.231
<v Speaker 3>This one right here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this thing doesn't have anybody's hands </v>

1145
00:54:15.231 --> 00:54:17.541
<v Speaker 3>on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think this is the one that I had seen </v>

1146
00:54:17.541 --> 00:54:17.541
<v Speaker 3>before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's see if there's any cases.</v>

1147
00:54:17.610 --> 00:54:22.610
<v Speaker 3>The question of intelligence is so much </v>
<v Speaker 3>more complicated than we generally </v>

1148
00:54:24.510 --> 00:54:26.040
<v Speaker 3>credited with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1149
00:54:26.370 --> 00:54:29.070
<v Speaker 3>not only among animals but also among </v>
<v Speaker 3>humans.</v>

1150
00:54:29.071 --> 00:54:32.190
<v Speaker 3>There's this big controversy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the perennial controversy.</v>

1151
00:54:32.191 --> 00:54:37.191
<v Speaker 3>That's the problem right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're constantly,</v>

1152
00:54:37.560 --> 00:54:41.340
<v Speaker 3>we're looking at another video and this </v>
<v Speaker 3>is the one that I had seen his.</v>

1153
00:54:41.580 --> 00:54:43.080
<v Speaker 3>Nobody's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nobody's touching.</v>

1154
00:54:43.190 --> 00:54:44.820
<v Speaker 3>Nobody's controlling him here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1155
00:54:44.821 --> 00:54:48.080
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't have any tusks it looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does he know?</v>

1156
00:54:48.840 --> 00:54:53.840
<v Speaker 3>So that looked like the guy was just </v>
<v Speaker 3>giving them the brush and he was doing </v>

1157
00:54:53.881 --> 00:54:55.120
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why don't they pull back though?</v>

1158
00:54:55.121 --> 00:54:57.200
<v Speaker 3>So you could see if that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

1159
00:54:57.201 --> 00:54:59.970
<v Speaker 3>this is the one that I had seen before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He hadn't seen the other one.</v>

1160
00:55:00.020 --> 00:55:01.340
<v Speaker 3>This one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would imagine that,</v>

1161
00:55:01.530 --> 00:55:02.550
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is an assistant.</v>

1162
00:55:02.850 --> 00:55:07.850
<v Speaker 3>I would imagine that if you did get a </v>
<v Speaker 3>guy like this that teaches is elephant </v>

1163
00:55:08.640 --> 00:55:13.640
<v Speaker 3>how to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how to paint a fucking picture that </v>

1164
00:55:13.640 --> 00:55:16.490
<v Speaker 3>you're going to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to become a tourist </v>

1165
00:55:16.490 --> 00:55:16.490
<v Speaker 3>attraction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People are going to say,</v>

1166
00:55:16.490 --> 00:55:16.620
<v Speaker 3>come and watch the elephant that paints </v>
<v Speaker 3>the picture.</v>

1167
00:55:16.740 --> 00:55:21.740
<v Speaker 3>You as seen on Youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then next thing you know you've got </v>

1168
00:55:21.740 --> 00:55:21.740
<v Speaker 3>a tourist business.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1169
00:55:21.740 --> 00:55:22.790
<v Speaker 3>and if he always does the same picture </v>
<v Speaker 3>to write,</v>

1170
00:55:22.850 --> 00:55:26.280
<v Speaker 3>draws himself over and over again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's right here.</v>

1171
00:55:26.340 --> 00:55:28.860
<v Speaker 3>It looks to me at least like the </v>
<v Speaker 3>elephants doing that.</v>

1172
00:55:29.370 --> 00:55:32.070
<v Speaker 3>You couldn't even talk a four year old </v>
<v Speaker 3>and doing that.</v>

1173
00:55:32.550 --> 00:55:36.900
<v Speaker 3>So you know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like four years here at elephant,</v>

1174
00:55:36.901 --> 00:55:38.360
<v Speaker 3>you have to ask him what the fuck it is </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1175
00:55:38.370 --> 00:55:40.740
<v Speaker 3>what is that like?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's an elephant.</v>

1176
00:55:40.750 --> 00:55:41.460
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whoa.</v>

1177
00:55:41.461 --> 00:55:46.461
<v Speaker 3>That elephants crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does it do you think it knows it's </v>

1178
00:55:46.461 --> 00:55:46.560
<v Speaker 3>drawing an elephant or it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a good question,</v>

1179
00:55:46.590 --> 00:55:47.880
<v Speaker 3>Mike.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Toronto tree,</v>

1180
00:55:47.950 --> 00:55:49.800
<v Speaker 3>he probably doesn't know is drawing an </v>
<v Speaker 3>elephant.</v>

1181
00:55:50.250 --> 00:55:55.250
<v Speaker 3>If I had to guess I would get out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>guests that it probably doesn't </v>

1182
00:55:55.250 --> 00:55:55.830
<v Speaker 3>understand the two d space like that </v>
<v Speaker 3>because if it did,</v>

1183
00:55:55.831 --> 00:55:59.160
<v Speaker 3>it would start creating art.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They start expressing themselves to each</v>

1184
00:55:59.161 --> 00:56:04.161
<v Speaker 3>other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They start drawing directions like go </v>

1185
00:56:04.161 --> 00:56:04.161
<v Speaker 3>this way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you start seeing animals do that,</v>

1186
00:56:04.290 --> 00:56:07.710
<v Speaker 3>that is so far beyond using tools.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what bees do.</v>

1187
00:56:08.390 --> 00:56:09.700
<v Speaker 3>These do it with smells,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1188
00:56:09.750 --> 00:56:11.160
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they do it with a dance.</v>

1189
00:56:11.190 --> 00:56:11.780
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they.</v>

1190
00:56:12.340 --> 00:56:15.210
<v Speaker 3>They give instructions on where the </v>
<v Speaker 3>flowers are.</v>

1191
00:56:16.410 --> 00:56:21.410
<v Speaker 3>So this question of intelligence is </v>
<v Speaker 3>really interesting and I think very </v>

1192
00:56:21.410 --> 00:56:24.651
<v Speaker 3>important because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we talk about intelligence as if know </v>

1193
00:56:24.651 --> 00:56:24.651
<v Speaker 3>what it is,</v>

1194
00:56:24.651 --> 00:56:28.030
<v Speaker 6>but we don't,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it expresses itself in so many itself in</v>

1195
00:56:28.031 --> 00:56:30.460
<v Speaker 6>so many different ways.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's so many manifestation.</v>

1196
00:56:30.700 --> 00:56:33.490
<v Speaker 6>So this big controversy that's happening</v>
<v Speaker 6>now among,</v>

1197
00:56:33.850 --> 00:56:35.350
<v Speaker 6>in between,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know if you're aware of this was</v>

1198
00:56:35.351 --> 00:56:40.351
<v Speaker 6>Sam Harris and I'm as recline and Andrew</v>
<v Speaker 6>Sullivan and people are trying to.</v>

1199
00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:43.120
<v Speaker 6>Charles Murray,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right,</v>

1200
00:56:43.130 --> 00:56:46.390
<v Speaker 6>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That whole thing about people that don't</v>

1201
00:56:46.391 --> 00:56:49.930
<v Speaker 6>know what that Charles Murray wrote this</v>
<v Speaker 6>book called the Bell Curve,</v>

1202
00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:51.510
<v Speaker 6>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>20 years ago or something,</v>

1203
00:56:51.700 --> 00:56:55.770
<v Speaker 6>25 even where he argued that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1204
00:56:55.840 --> 00:56:59.740
<v Speaker 6>there are racial differences in </v>
<v Speaker 6>intelligence,</v>

1205
00:57:00.100 --> 00:57:05.100
<v Speaker 6>a ICU specifically with Asians being the</v>
<v Speaker 6>highest and then whites and then blacks </v>

1206
00:57:05.411 --> 00:57:07.510
<v Speaker 6>and that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's just the way it is.</v>

1207
00:57:07.511 --> 00:57:12.511
<v Speaker 6>And social adjustments aren't going to </v>
<v Speaker 6>change that because it's largely </v>

1208
00:57:12.511 --> 00:57:17.251
<v Speaker 6>genetic.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And as I understand that was the </v>

1209
00:57:17.251 --> 00:57:20.851
<v Speaker 6>argument.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I haven't noticed saying largely </v>

1210
00:57:20.851 --> 00:57:20.860
<v Speaker 6>genetic,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I think they're saying that genetics</v>

1211
00:57:20.861 --> 00:57:23.380
<v Speaker 6>play a factor and environment plays a </v>
<v Speaker 6>factor.</v>

1212
00:57:23.380 --> 00:57:28.380
<v Speaker 6>I think some people are not willing to </v>
<v Speaker 6>look at genetics if it shows an </v>

1213
00:57:28.690 --> 00:57:33.550
<v Speaker 6>unfavorable trait in minorities.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They don't want to look at it.</v>

1214
00:57:33.800 --> 00:57:34.350
<v Speaker 6>They,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

1215
00:57:34.450 --> 00:57:39.450
<v Speaker 6>they did not true,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I think it's also true that part of </v>

1216
00:57:39.611 --> 00:57:44.611
<v Speaker 6>the argument is that social programs are</v>
<v Speaker 6>a waste of money because they're not </v>

1217
00:57:44.951 --> 00:57:48.430
<v Speaker 6>going to affect it because it's genetic.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's crazy.</v>

1218
00:57:48.490 --> 00:57:52.630
<v Speaker 6>I that I'm pretty sure that the argument</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's just straight racist to me.</v>

1219
00:57:52.780 --> 00:57:57.780
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think that's what people are the idea </v>

1220
00:57:57.780 --> 00:57:57.780
<v Speaker 6>like save your money to save your money.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>

1221
00:57:57.780 --> 00:58:01.940
<v Speaker 6>Do a better job.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like you don't even know if it works </v>

1222
00:58:01.940 --> 00:58:01.940
<v Speaker 6>because what have you done?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like what?</v>

1223
00:58:01.940 --> 00:58:06.810
<v Speaker 6>Well go to an inner city school and </v>
<v Speaker 6>pretend you're a 10 year old kid trying </v>

1224
00:58:06.810 --> 00:58:10.981
<v Speaker 6>to get by in this life and you're </v>
<v Speaker 6>literally seeing gang members and </v>

1225
00:58:10.981 --> 00:58:14.791
<v Speaker 6>craziness and people flashing cash and </v>
<v Speaker 6>people dropping out because they're </v>

1226
00:58:14.791 --> 00:58:16.720
<v Speaker 6>pregnant when their 13th and you're </v>
<v Speaker 6>trying to tell me there's not.</v>

1227
00:58:16.840 --> 00:58:19.780
<v Speaker 6>There's not some sort of a massive </v>
<v Speaker 6>environmental factor.</v>

1228
00:58:19.900 --> 00:58:22.810
<v Speaker 6>If you are a white kid going to a school</v>
<v Speaker 6>like that.</v>

1229
00:58:22.960 --> 00:58:27.010
<v Speaker 6>I only went to a bad school for one year</v>
<v Speaker 6>of my life.</v>

1230
00:58:27.610 --> 00:58:29.500
<v Speaker 6>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm no Oji,</v>

1231
00:58:29.860 --> 00:58:33.670
<v Speaker 6>but I really did go to one bad school,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Mary curly,</v>

1232
00:58:33.850 --> 00:58:37.900
<v Speaker 6>a Middle School in Jamaica Plain and the</v>
<v Speaker 6>Jamaica Plain,</v>

1233
00:58:37.901 --> 00:58:41.500
<v Speaker 6>Massachusetts.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's now it's become gentrified,</v>

1234
00:58:41.501 --> 00:58:46.501
<v Speaker 6>sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's kind of like East la or I'm a </v>

1235
00:58:46.501 --> 00:58:46.501
<v Speaker 6>silver,</v>
<v Speaker 6>silver lake area,</v>

1236
00:58:46.501 --> 00:58:48.670
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a lot of hipsters have moved in and nice</v>

1237
00:58:48.671 --> 00:58:51.400
<v Speaker 6>places,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but when I lived there it was not good.</v>

1238
00:58:51.640 --> 00:58:55.060
<v Speaker 6>It was very poor people in the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 6>middle school was scary.</v>

1239
00:58:55.480 --> 00:59:00.480
<v Speaker 6>It was scary.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Seventeen year old kids and my seventh </v>

1240
00:59:00.480 --> 00:59:00.480
<v Speaker 6>grade class,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no one it'd be,</v>

1241
00:59:00.480 --> 00:59:01.000
<v Speaker 6>it was just a weird play.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Maybe.</v>

1242
00:59:01.090 --> 00:59:04.630
<v Speaker 6>I guess it was eighth grade,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but the point was these kids were.</v>

1243
00:59:04.690 --> 00:59:09.690
<v Speaker 6>They were never going to graduate.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They knew it and they were trying to go </v>

1244
00:59:09.690 --> 00:59:09.690
<v Speaker 6>back to seventh grade again or eighth </v>
<v Speaker 6>grade,</v>

1245
00:59:09.690 --> 00:59:14.041
<v Speaker 6>whatever the fuck it was,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and the teacher would have them in the </v>

1246
00:59:14.041 --> 00:59:16.891
<v Speaker 6>class for a couple of days and then they</v>
<v Speaker 6>would leave and everywhere you walked </v>

1247
00:59:16.891 --> 00:59:20.101
<v Speaker 6>you were scared everywhere you walk.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like some weird shit was happening with </v>

1248
00:59:20.101 --> 00:59:21.220
<v Speaker 6>people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>People yelling at people.</v>

1249
00:59:21.230 --> 00:59:22.550
<v Speaker 6>There was always tension</v>

1250
00:59:22.850 --> 00:59:25.670
<v Speaker 3>and there was always like bigger kids </v>
<v Speaker 3>around that were robbing other kids,</v>

1251
00:59:25.671 --> 00:59:27.680
<v Speaker 3>like fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I got through that year going,</v>

1252
00:59:27.710 --> 00:59:30.380
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and when I got out of there,</v>

1253
00:59:30.410 --> 00:59:33.440
<v Speaker 3>my parents moved,</v>
<v Speaker 3>moved to a really nice part of town,</v>

1254
00:59:33.441 --> 00:59:38.441
<v Speaker 3>Newton.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you're a kid growing up in that </v>

1255
00:59:38.441 --> 00:59:41.831
<v Speaker 3>environment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>good fucking luck learning anything </v>

1256
00:59:41.831 --> 00:59:41.831
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fucking probably it's,</v>

1257
00:59:41.831 --> 00:59:42.410
<v Speaker 3>it's pretty bad at home too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1258
00:59:42.411 --> 00:59:47.411
<v Speaker 3>And what I experienced in Jamaica plain </v>
<v Speaker 3>was nothing compared to Dorchester and </v>

1259
00:59:47.411 --> 00:59:47.630
<v Speaker 3>Roxbury.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are the bad areas.</v>

1260
00:59:47.840 --> 00:59:50.960
<v Speaker 3>They were way worse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we know that anxiety,</v>

1261
00:59:50.961 --> 00:59:52.330
<v Speaker 3>stress,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1262
00:59:52.400 --> 00:59:54.190
<v Speaker 3>stops brain development.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1263
00:59:54.290 --> 00:59:55.280
<v Speaker 3>Retards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1264
00:59:55.460 --> 00:59:58.790
<v Speaker 3>It also makes people much more inclined </v>
<v Speaker 3>to violence when you're,</v>

1265
00:59:58.791 --> 01:00:00.650
<v Speaker 3>when you grow up in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even in the womb,</v>

1266
01:00:00.890 --> 01:00:05.890
<v Speaker 3>if your mother's around horrible </v>
<v Speaker 3>situations and people screaming and </v>

1267
01:00:05.890 --> 01:00:07.670
<v Speaker 3>fighting and that cortisol and </v>
<v Speaker 3>adrenaline and all those,</v>

1268
01:00:07.970 --> 01:00:09.890
<v Speaker 3>all those hormones are flowing through </v>
<v Speaker 3>that baby.</v>

1269
01:00:09.890 --> 01:00:12.130
<v Speaker 3>Pairing that baby for a violent world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1270
01:00:12.500 --> 01:00:15.050
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure you know about the epigenetics </v>
<v Speaker 3>that show that,</v>

1271
01:00:15.080 --> 01:00:19.580
<v Speaker 3>that can pass several generations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your grandfather was in a famine.</v>

1272
01:00:19.581 --> 01:00:22.490
<v Speaker 3>You're more likely to be obese and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy.</v>

1273
01:00:22.550 --> 01:00:23.490
<v Speaker 3>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1274
01:00:23.660 --> 01:00:27.410
<v Speaker 3>You also live longer though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not weird like the people that were,</v>

1275
01:00:27.411 --> 01:00:29.810
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that were in famine people,</v>

1276
01:00:29.930 --> 01:00:32.180
<v Speaker 3>their kids lived longer for some strange</v>
<v Speaker 3>reason.</v>

1277
01:00:32.181 --> 01:00:33.020
<v Speaker 3>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1278
01:00:33.021 --> 01:00:36.830
<v Speaker 3>Like your body is preparing you and be </v>
<v Speaker 3>extra durable like we were talking about</v>

1279
01:00:36.831 --> 01:00:41.831
<v Speaker 3>before the podcast started.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And fasting is the only intervention </v>

1280
01:00:41.991 --> 01:00:43.880
<v Speaker 3>that's ever been shown to extend </v>
<v Speaker 3>lifespan.</v>

1281
01:00:44.050 --> 01:00:45.050
<v Speaker 3>Mm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nut nuts.</v>

1282
01:00:45.130 --> 01:00:47.510
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do it because it makes me.</v>

1283
01:00:47.511 --> 01:00:51.740
<v Speaker 3>I'm just function better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do it every 16 hours.</v>

1284
01:00:51.741 --> 01:00:53.060
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I eat,</v>

1285
01:00:53.510 --> 01:00:58.510
<v Speaker 3>so uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll eat and then I don't eat for 16 </v>

1286
01:00:58.510 --> 01:00:59.420
<v Speaker 3>hours so I'll eat for eight hours a day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

1287
01:00:59.930 --> 01:01:03.590
<v Speaker 3>When that's over,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's over 9:00</v>

1288
01:01:03.590 --> 01:01:05.060
<v Speaker 3>AM to 5:00</v>
<v Speaker 3>PM or whatever it is.</v>

1289
01:01:05.060 --> 01:01:09.230
<v Speaker 3>I just figured out what the time is and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then add 16 to it cheating.</v>

1290
01:01:09.231 --> 01:01:12.850
<v Speaker 3>I add 14 but I never had less than 14.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see.</v>

1291
01:01:13.030 --> 01:01:18.030
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was talking to a guy recently about </v>

1292
01:01:18.030 --> 01:01:18.200
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm Brian Fries and you're in Austin.</v>

<v Speaker 3>really smart guy.</v>

1294
01:01:19.940 --> 01:01:21.410
<v Speaker 3>And we were talking about this and he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1295
01:01:21.411 --> 01:01:24.350
<v Speaker 3>I only eat when the sun's up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's easy to keep track of.</v>

1296
01:01:24.410 --> 01:01:29.410
<v Speaker 3>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what if you want to go to a nice </v>

1297
01:01:29.410 --> 01:01:29.790
<v Speaker 3>dinner?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't eat cow,</v>

1298
01:01:30.570 --> 01:01:32.360
<v Speaker 3>go earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know you got to have cheat days.</v>

1299
01:01:32.361 --> 01:01:33.320
<v Speaker 3>When he said it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1300
01:01:33.321 --> 01:01:33.930
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1303
01:01:37.430 --> 01:01:40.010
<v Speaker 3>that's not gonna work for me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I go to a restaurant,</v>

1304
01:01:40.011 --> 01:01:41.840
<v Speaker 3>I'll allow myself to have a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 3>of bread,</v>

1305
01:01:41.900 --> 01:01:44.000
<v Speaker 3>allow myself to have dessert,</v>
<v Speaker 3>occasionally,</v>

1306
01:01:44.030 --> 01:01:47.090
<v Speaker 3>allow myself to eat some shitty things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe a little pasta.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You have to be.</v>

1308

<v Speaker 3>And also I enjoy the art form of </v>

1309
01:01:54.701 --> 01:01:57.740
<v Speaker 3>cooking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I enjoy that people make these delicious</v>

1320
01:02:25.310 --> 01:02:28.680

<v Speaker 4>And the reason I love travel is that you</v>

1321
01:02:28.681 --> 01:02:33.681
<v Speaker 4>can wake up and have no idea what your </v>
<v Speaker 4>life's going to be like by the time you </v>

<v Speaker 2>willing to do this because now they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be sending you direct messages.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in a world of micro podcasting where</v>

<v Speaker 2>They're just want to tie you up a </v>

1377

<v Speaker 2>little.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

1378
01:04:39.620 --> 01:04:41.840

<v Speaker 2>I remember showing you what time,</v>

1379
01:04:41.930 --> 01:04:46.930
<v Speaker 2>long time ago I was here doing a podcast</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my phone and a message came in and I </v>

1380
01:04:46.930 --> 01:04:51.401
<v Speaker 2>looked and it was this really hot woman </v>

01:06:21.240 --> 01:06:25.201
<v Speaker 2>if he could get a hunter gatherer is </v>
<v Speaker 2>microbiome because it's a much more </v>

1422
01:06:25.201 --> 01:06:26.620
<v Speaker 2>complex microbiome.</v>

01:06:33.611 --> 01:06:36.460
<v Speaker 2>that's him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He points to the end of the table.</v>

1426
01:06:36.610 --> 01:06:38.280
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

<v Speaker 2>First person to write about Sapo,</v>

01:07:44.500 --> 01:07:45.940
<v Speaker 2>you know the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the burn.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1452
01:07:47.230 --> 01:07:49.240
<v Speaker 2>Really interesting dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's in Texas too.</v>

1453
01:07:49.450 --> 01:07:51.160
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We drove up to see him.</v>

1454
01:07:51.161 --> 01:07:53.680
<v Speaker 2>So it's Kinda like just cruising around </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the van,</v>

1455
01:07:53.710 --> 01:07:58.710
<v Speaker 2>like hanging out with cool people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I heard that frog poison stuff is </v>

1456
01:07:58.710 --> 01:08:00.610
<v Speaker 2>horrible that the trip.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1457
01:08:00.820 --> 01:08:05.820
<v Speaker 2>I mean I guess it was Aubrey wasn't an </v>
<v Speaker 2>artery that was on the podcast talking </v>

1458
01:08:05.820 --> 01:08:07.960
<v Speaker 2>about doing the tree frog poison.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pretty sure it was him.</v>

1459
01:08:07.961 --> 01:08:11.200
<v Speaker 2>He's done everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like Mikey from that commercial,</v>

1460
01:08:11.350 --> 01:08:15.560
<v Speaker 2>but for life he hates everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's in there.</v>

1461
01:08:15.561 --> 01:08:16.100
<v Speaker 2>That's all</v>

1462
01:08:16.250 --> 01:08:17.900
<v Speaker 6>he loves.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Everything takes everything.</v>

1463
01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:19.280
<v Speaker 6>But he,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

1464
01:08:19.400 --> 01:08:21.290
<v Speaker 6>he was saying it was just a terrible </v>
<v Speaker 6>ordeal,</v>

1465
01:08:21.350 --> 01:08:22.100
<v Speaker 6>but there was,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

1466
01:08:22.430 --> 01:08:27.430
<v Speaker 6>there was also an article that I read </v>
<v Speaker 6>about certain countries where they </v>

1467
01:08:27.430 --> 01:08:32.110
<v Speaker 6>didn't have an endogenous psychedelic or</v>
<v Speaker 6>didn't have a local psychedelic,</v>

1468
01:08:32.390 --> 01:08:34.820
<v Speaker 6>so these people would take ordeal </v>
<v Speaker 6>poisons,</v>

1469
01:08:35.270 --> 01:08:40.270
<v Speaker 6>so they would take poisons that would </v>
<v Speaker 6>get them like literally to the brink of </v>

1470
01:08:40.270 --> 01:08:44.591
<v Speaker 6>death and then they would come out of it</v>
<v Speaker 6>like a near death experience and that </v>

1471
01:08:44.591 --> 01:08:47.780
<v Speaker 6>this near death experience provided some</v>
<v Speaker 6>sort of a shamanistic,</v>

1472
01:08:48.070 --> 01:08:49.190
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

1473
01:08:49.240 --> 01:08:54.240
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>some sort of a breakthrough experience </v>

1474
01:08:54.240 --> 01:08:54.240
<v Speaker 6>where you could move on to the next </v>
<v Speaker 6>level.</v>

1475
01:08:54.240 --> 01:08:55.720
<v Speaker 6>Like you had experienced something that </v>
<v Speaker 6>was like,</v>

1476
01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:57.470
<v Speaker 6>like we were talking about before the </v>
<v Speaker 6>podcast,</v>

1477
01:08:57.471 --> 01:09:00.410
<v Speaker 6>like when you lived in Portland and then</v>
<v Speaker 6>coming here in la when it's sunny out,</v>

1478
01:09:00.411 --> 01:09:01.610
<v Speaker 6>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>ah,</v>

1479
01:09:01.970 --> 01:09:04.820
<v Speaker 6>Simon,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you just feel it like that.</v>

1480
01:09:04.820 --> 01:09:09.820
<v Speaker 6>It's similar,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a similar theory about a Africa that </v>

1481
01:09:09.820 --> 01:09:11.780
<v Speaker 6>there aren't a lot of endogenous </v>
<v Speaker 6>psychedelic plants.</v>

1482
01:09:11.781 --> 01:09:16.781
<v Speaker 6>They're Boga is one of the only ones and</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's incredibly strong and not </v>

1483
01:09:16.781 --> 01:09:21.131
<v Speaker 6>available all over the continent.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so they develop complex rhythms to </v>

1484
01:09:21.131 --> 01:09:22.640
<v Speaker 6>provoke a altered state.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Hmm.</v>

1485
01:09:22.760 --> 01:09:27.760
<v Speaker 6>That makes sense and that's why African </v>
<v Speaker 6>rhythms are so complex and native </v>

1486
01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:30.110
<v Speaker 6>American rhythms are very simple.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's because they were hot as fuck,</v>

1487
01:09:30.400 --> 01:09:31.610
<v Speaker 6>fuck already.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And just boom,</v>

1488
01:09:31.611 --> 01:09:32.120
<v Speaker 6>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 6>boom.</v>

1489
01:09:32.121 --> 01:09:33.710
<v Speaker 6>As you know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Have you heard,</v>

1490
01:09:34.100 --> 01:09:37.520
<v Speaker 6>have you ever heard any of the Eco rose </v>
<v Speaker 6>that ob replays when he has his little?</v>

1491
01:09:38.100 --> 01:09:41.790
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they.</v>

1492
01:09:42.260 --> 01:09:47.260
<v Speaker 6>He's got these arrows that he got from </v>
<v Speaker 6>these South American Shamans and I </v>

1493
01:09:47.270 --> 01:09:52.270
<v Speaker 6>listened to him sometimes when I write </v>
<v Speaker 6>because I like listening to things that </v>

1494
01:09:52.270 --> 01:09:54.690
<v Speaker 6>I don't know the language when I write </v>
<v Speaker 6>like I like a guy,</v>

1495
01:09:54.740 --> 01:09:59.210
<v Speaker 6>like some music from Armenia,</v>
<v Speaker 6>some Lebanese music I like.</v>

1496
01:09:59.310 --> 01:10:04.310
<v Speaker 6>It's cool listening to things where I </v>
<v Speaker 6>have no idea what they're saying so I </v>

1497
01:10:04.310 --> 01:10:06.530
<v Speaker 6>don't get wrapped up in what I feel </v>
<v Speaker 6>their emotions,</v>

1498
01:10:06.531 --> 01:10:11.531
<v Speaker 6>but I don't get wrapped up in whatever </v>
<v Speaker 6>they're talking about so I can write </v>

1499
01:10:11.531 --> 01:10:14.370
<v Speaker 6>about whatever fucking table tops.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So a lot of good music out there.</v>

1500
01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:16.580
<v Speaker 6>And Brazilian.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The African?</v>

1501
01:10:16.581 --> 01:10:17.550
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I.</v>

1502
01:10:17.600 --> 01:10:22.600
<v Speaker 6>Most of the music I listened to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't understand the words because I </v>

1503
01:10:22.600 --> 01:10:24.830
<v Speaker 6>really fixate on the words if I do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The ECO rows are crazy because they,</v>

1504
01:10:24.890 --> 01:10:28.460
<v Speaker 6>they make the psychedelic trip dance to </v>
<v Speaker 6>them,</v>

1505
01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:33.560
<v Speaker 6>like dmt dmt with the negroes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You realize like the [inaudible].</v>

1506
01:10:33.680 --> 01:10:38.680
<v Speaker 6>It's like a technology that was invented</v>
<v Speaker 6>to work with DMT,</v>

1507
01:10:39.830 --> 01:10:41.390
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like this is like,</v>

1508
01:10:41.391 --> 01:10:44.330
<v Speaker 6>give me some volume on this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is what they sound like</v>

1509
01:10:50.990 --> 01:10:54.920
<v Speaker 6>now by itself.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You listen to this right now and you go,</v>

1510
01:10:54.921 --> 01:10:57.620
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is just like some weird slow music,</v>

1511
01:10:58.820 --> 01:11:03.820
<v Speaker 6>but when you're in the dimension of </v>
<v Speaker 6>dimethyltryptamine and the world has </v>

1512
01:11:04.551 --> 01:11:08.810
<v Speaker 6>become infinite fractals that are moving</v>
<v Speaker 6>and changing and morphing.</v>

1513
01:11:08.990 --> 01:11:13.990
<v Speaker 6>When you hear this song,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the hallucinations or whatever they are </v>

1514
01:11:13.990 --> 01:11:15.630
<v Speaker 6>that you're experiencing the </v>
<v Speaker 6>visualizations,</v>

1515
01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:18.930
<v Speaker 6>they danced to the song 100 percent in </v>
<v Speaker 6>sync,</v>

1516
01:11:19.770 --> 01:11:23.130
<v Speaker 6>so all this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's comforting.</v>

1517
01:11:23.280 --> 01:11:28.280
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's another thing that keeps people </v>

1518
01:11:28.280 --> 01:11:30.651
<v Speaker 6>from having bad trips sometimes because </v>
<v Speaker 6>they can cling to the music and the </v>

1519
01:11:30.651 --> 01:11:34.221
<v Speaker 6>structure in the music.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Whereas their own paranoia and fear and </v>

1520
01:11:34.221 --> 01:11:38.540
<v Speaker 6>inability to let go gets hit with that </v>
<v Speaker 6>psychedelic Jews and just experienced </v>

1521
01:11:39.841 --> 01:11:44.841
<v Speaker 6>that new and some people freak out,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but this music might be able to bring </v>

1522
01:11:44.841 --> 01:11:48.411
<v Speaker 6>them down.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It sounds like what a fetus might hear </v>

1523
01:11:48.411 --> 01:11:48.411
<v Speaker 6>in the womb</v>

1524
01:11:48.411 --> 01:11:50.000
<v Speaker 7>got that heartbeat to.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

1525
01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:52.450
<v Speaker 7>right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Imagine what fetus here.</v>

1526
01:11:57.970 --> 01:12:02.970
<v Speaker 6>See,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I like listening to this kind of shit </v>

1527
01:12:02.970 --> 01:12:04.531
<v Speaker 6>when I write because I don't have no </v>
<v Speaker 6>idea what they're saying and so I can </v>

1528
01:12:04.531 --> 01:12:06.970
<v Speaker 6>just keep it on the background and also </v>
<v Speaker 6>makes me feel like just knowing,</v>

1529
01:12:07.900 --> 01:12:11.440
<v Speaker 6>just knowing that that's out there,</v>
<v Speaker 6>knowing that the DMT world is out there,</v>

1530
01:12:11.441 --> 01:12:16.441
<v Speaker 6>it makes me just a little bit nervous.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It makes you write better when you're </v>

1531
01:12:16.441 --> 01:12:16.441
<v Speaker 6>writing jokes or others,</v>
<v Speaker 6>everything,</v>

1532
01:12:16.441 --> 01:12:21.091
<v Speaker 6>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Either you ever written a book or essay </v>

1533
01:12:21.091 --> 01:12:24.181
<v Speaker 6>or stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've written essays to write a lot in </v>

1534
01:12:24.181 --> 01:12:24.181
<v Speaker 6>some of your essays.</v>
<v Speaker 6>One,</v>

1535
01:12:24.181 --> 01:12:24.720
<v Speaker 6>are we talking about it?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1536
01:12:24.970 --> 01:12:29.970
<v Speaker 6>You run a beautiful one couple of years </v>
<v Speaker 6>ago about that that I really,</v>

1537
01:12:30.311 --> 01:12:33.100
<v Speaker 6>I don't know if I've ever told you how </v>
<v Speaker 6>much I appreciated that actually.</v>

1538
01:12:33.370 --> 01:12:34.920
<v Speaker 6>It was about,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

1539
01:12:35.230 --> 01:12:40.230
<v Speaker 6>how the quest for optimal fitness </v>
<v Speaker 6>shouldn't be taken as in mortality.</v>

1540
01:12:44.830 --> 01:12:46.210
<v Speaker 6>That we're all going to die.</v>

1541
01:12:46.210 --> 01:12:47.860
<v Speaker 6>And do you got to sort of deal with </v>
<v Speaker 6>that?</v>

1542
01:12:47.861 --> 01:12:52.861
<v Speaker 6>Do you remember what I'm talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think I wrote your body's a </v>

1543
01:12:52.861 --> 01:12:52.960
<v Speaker 6>sandcastle.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's what it is.</v>

1544
01:12:53.300 --> 01:12:58.300
<v Speaker 6>Sand castles are beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but one of the beautiful things about </v>

1545
01:12:58.300 --> 01:13:01.051
<v Speaker 6>this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we know how temporary they are when you </v>

1546
01:13:01.051 --> 01:13:01.051
<v Speaker 6>see a sand castle,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's not just like,</v>

1547
01:13:01.051 --> 01:13:01.051
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this guy made an amazing sculpture,</v>

1548
01:13:01.340 --> 01:13:01.860
<v Speaker 6>so I go,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

1549
01:13:01.870 --> 01:13:04.600
<v Speaker 6>this person made something that they </v>
<v Speaker 6>know is not going to last,</v>

1550
01:13:04.930 --> 01:13:06.610
<v Speaker 6>and they put a massive amount of work </v>
<v Speaker 6>into it,</v>

1551
01:13:06.611 --> 01:13:08.940
<v Speaker 6>but part of the beauty of it is that a </v>
<v Speaker 6>soft collar?</v>

1552
01:13:09.430 --> 01:13:10.090
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I really,</v>

1553
01:13:10.100 --> 01:13:12.280
<v Speaker 6>I enjoy that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think that was for a magazine.</v>

1554
01:13:12.680 --> 01:13:14.170
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I forget what magazine.</v>

1555
01:13:14.171 --> 01:13:19.171
<v Speaker 6>So you have a book in mind.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I started writing a book and then I had </v>

1556
01:13:19.691 --> 01:13:22.360
<v Speaker 6>to deal with the publishing company,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like wanting.</v>

1557
01:13:22.540 --> 01:13:25.270
<v Speaker 6>They wanted very specific kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 6>writing.</v>

1558
01:13:26.130 --> 01:13:26.460
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's.</v>

1559
01:13:26.461 --> 01:13:27.400
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's for maximum.</v>

1560
01:13:27.490 --> 01:13:28.710
<v Speaker 6>That's what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

1561
01:13:28.930 --> 01:13:31.930
<v Speaker 6>they wanted very specific,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like they want a jokey jokes.</v>

1562
01:13:31.960 --> 01:13:36.960
<v Speaker 6>They,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they even offered to just pay me to </v>

1563
01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:36.960
<v Speaker 6>transcribe my act.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I was like,</v>

1564
01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:38.020
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And they go,</v>

1565
01:13:38.021 --> 01:13:40.900
<v Speaker 6>but these people did it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Some famous comedians did it.</v>

1566
01:13:40.940 --> 01:13:41.980
<v Speaker 6>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's fine.</v>

1567
01:13:42.040 --> 01:13:44.170
<v Speaker 6>I just not what I want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I like writing,</v>

1568
01:13:44.470 --> 01:13:47.530
<v Speaker 6>but I like writing shit that I feel like</v>
<v Speaker 6>writing,</v>

1569
01:13:47.560 --> 01:13:49.150
<v Speaker 6>like I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to have some.</v>

1570
01:13:49.151 --> 01:13:52.690
<v Speaker 6>So when we went into it they like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we love your blogs,</v>

1571
01:13:52.691 --> 01:13:54.400
<v Speaker 6>we think you're really funny.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

1572
01:13:54.770 --> 01:13:57.580
<v Speaker 6>this will be good for you had the </v>
<v Speaker 6>podcast.</v>

1573
01:13:57.820 --> 01:13:58.870
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1574
01:13:58.900 --> 01:14:00.620
<v Speaker 6>so I gave him all their money back.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I just,</v>

1575
01:14:00.630 --> 01:14:01.690
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1576
01:14:01.730 --> 01:14:05.550
<v Speaker 6>just at this point on free,</v>
<v Speaker 6>free range to do whatever you want it.</v>

1577
01:14:06.220 --> 01:14:11.220
<v Speaker 6>I just think that anytime you willingly </v>
<v Speaker 6>take on some new project</v>

1578
01:14:12.460 --> 01:14:15.170
<v Speaker 5>managers and others,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they might like their,</v>

1579
01:14:15.580 --> 01:14:19.090
<v Speaker 5>their opinion might very well be valid,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I'm not looking for it.</v>

1580
01:14:19.480 --> 01:14:24.070
<v Speaker 5>I want whatever I write to be out of my </v>
<v Speaker 5>head and whether it's good or bad,</v>

1581
01:14:24.130 --> 01:14:26.890
<v Speaker 5>dependent upon how much focus and </v>
<v Speaker 5>attention I put into it,</v>

1582
01:14:27.670 --> 01:14:28.040
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

1583
01:14:28.041 --> 01:14:30.700
<v Speaker 5>I'm pretty self critical so if I think </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's Clunky,</v>

1584
01:14:30.701 --> 01:14:35.701
<v Speaker 5>I'll try to Redo it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I'm not interested in like </v>

1585
01:14:35.701 --> 01:14:38.020
<v Speaker 5>artistically or creatively going down a </v>
<v Speaker 5>direction where somebody else is picking</v>

1586
01:14:38.021 --> 01:14:41.270
<v Speaker 5>the subject matter or somebody else's </v>
<v Speaker 5>suggesting like,</v>

1587
01:14:41.350 --> 01:14:41.710
<v Speaker 5>I'm not.</v>

1588
01:14:42.520 --> 01:14:44.770
<v Speaker 2>That's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no reason for you to do that.</v>

1589
01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:47.590
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got the massive platform and well</v>

1590
01:14:47.591 --> 01:14:48.940
<v Speaker 2>established voice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't.</v>

1591
01:14:49.560 --> 01:14:54.560
<v Speaker 2>I think honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think publishing is at the napster </v>

1592
01:14:54.560 --> 01:14:55.530
<v Speaker 2>stage right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's.</v>

1593
01:14:55.531 --> 01:14:57.460
<v Speaker 2>It's sort of collapsing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm at,</v>

1594
01:14:57.580 --> 01:15:02.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm finishing this book I've been </v>
<v Speaker 2>working on for a few years now and I </v>

1595
01:15:02.580 --> 01:15:05.770
<v Speaker 2>don't know that I'll ever published </v>
<v Speaker 2>another book with major publishers will.</v>

1596
01:15:05.771 --> 01:15:06.820
<v Speaker 2>You've had great success with</v>

1597
01:15:06.930 --> 01:15:11.930
<v Speaker 5>podcast as well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the beautiful thing about your </v>

1598
01:15:11.930 --> 01:15:12.210
<v Speaker 5>podcast is it allows you to put out an </v>
<v Speaker 5>idea almost instantaneously.</v>

1599
01:15:12.211 --> 01:15:14.340
<v Speaker 5>I mean you get together with this </v>
<v Speaker 5>rattlesnake guy,</v>

1600
01:15:14.430 --> 01:15:15.990
<v Speaker 5>you guys have a couple of our </v>
<v Speaker 5>conversation.</v>

1601
01:15:15.991 --> 01:15:17.460
<v Speaker 5>You upload that shit and that's it.</v>

1602
01:15:17.700 --> 01:15:22.700
<v Speaker 2>It's wonderful and it brings these </v>
<v Speaker 2>really interesting people into my life </v>

1603
01:15:22.700 --> 01:15:26.121
<v Speaker 2>and my circle of friends now is largely </v>
<v Speaker 2>composed of either guests or listeners </v>

1604
01:15:27.181 --> 01:15:28.370
<v Speaker 2>of the podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1605
01:15:28.380 --> 01:15:29.120
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1606
01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:34.280
<v Speaker 2>it's wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just put out a book recently that's a </v>

1607
01:15:34.830 --> 01:15:39.830
<v Speaker 2>sort of compilations of podcasts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's not the whole conversation </v>

1608
01:15:40.531 --> 01:15:45.531
<v Speaker 2>obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's excerpts and the whole thing </v>

1609
01:15:45.531 --> 01:15:46.440
<v Speaker 2>was crowd sourced.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So people who listen to the podcast pick</v>

1610
01:15:46.441 --> 01:15:51.441
<v Speaker 2>the episodes they picked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what part of the episodes that they </v>

1611
01:15:51.441 --> 01:15:52.560
<v Speaker 2>thought was most interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They transcribed it.</v>

1612
01:15:52.920 --> 01:15:57.920
<v Speaker 2>This Guy Adam mcdade did all the art,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the publisher misfit press or people </v>

1613
01:15:57.920 --> 01:16:02.901
<v Speaker 2>that I know through the podcasts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They reached out to me and we had some </v>

1614
01:16:02.901 --> 01:16:04.770
<v Speaker 2>beers and it was not intending to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything together.</v>

1615
01:16:04.771 --> 01:16:05.550
<v Speaker 2>Just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey dude,</v>

1616
01:16:05.551 --> 01:16:09.450
<v Speaker 2>we're in town and we'd like your show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can we get a beer and really liked these</v>

1617
01:16:09.451 --> 01:16:14.451
<v Speaker 2>guys and ended up having the CEO on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>podcast aj and um,</v>

1618
01:16:15.960 --> 01:16:16.140

01:16:16.140 --> 01:16:21.140
<v Speaker 2>So we just put out the book and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it sort of fulfills my fantasy of being </v>

<v Speaker 2>a writer without having to write,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1637
01:17:06.170 --> 01:17:07.140
<v Speaker 2>amazing conversations that I've had with</v>
<v Speaker 2>people on this podcast that I would love</v>

1638
01:17:07.141 --> 01:17:12.141
<v Speaker 2>to see written down or I could read it,</v>

<v Speaker 2>it's like a little thing.</v>

1642
01:17:15.231 --> 01:17:16.580
<v Speaker 2>You just pick it up.</v>

<v Speaker 2>there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't need to follow the flow or the</v>

1644
01:17:19.390 --> 01:17:20.480
<v Speaker 2>end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're encouraging reading,</v>

1645
01:17:20.481 --> 01:17:25.481
<v Speaker 2>which is a dying thing and people and in</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are a lot of people out there who </v>

1646
01:17:25.481 --> 01:17:25.481
<v Speaker 2>don't listen to podcasts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1647
01:17:25.481 --> 01:17:27.710
<v Speaker 2>Me included.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I rarely listen to podcasts.</v>

1648
01:17:27.770 --> 01:17:29.240
<v Speaker 2>Do you listen to books on tape?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1649
01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:29.910
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1650
01:17:30.010 --> 01:17:33.230
<v Speaker 2>We'll see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have spaces in my life where I'm</v>

1651
01:17:33.231 --> 01:17:38.231
<v Speaker 2>doing something that would allow me to </v>
<v Speaker 2>listen to voices talking that wouldn't </v>

1652
01:17:39.291 --> 01:17:41.500
<v Speaker 2>interfere with what I'm doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>

1653
01:17:41.660 --> 01:17:43.160
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a carpenter.</v>

1654
01:17:43.161 --> 01:17:45.850
<v Speaker 2>I'm not driving long distances,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1655
01:17:45.890 --> 01:17:50.890
<v Speaker 2>it's like I'm either writing or I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing the doing my podcast or something </v>

1656
01:17:52.611 --> 01:17:54.200
<v Speaker 2>else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's not,</v>

1657
01:17:54.201 --> 01:17:56.090
<v Speaker 2>I don't commute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

1658
01:17:56.470 --> 01:18:01.040
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there's a specific sort of activities</v>

1659
01:18:01.041 --> 01:18:06.041
<v Speaker 2>that lend lend themselves to listening </v>
<v Speaker 2>to podcasts and a lot of people just </v>

1660
01:18:06.041 --> 01:18:09.851
<v Speaker 2>don't have those spaces in their lives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I envisioned the book is like </v>

1661
01:18:09.851 --> 01:18:11.180
<v Speaker 2>something where people can be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey dude,</v>

1662
01:18:11.181 --> 01:18:14.090
<v Speaker 2>I know you don't listen to podcasts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this is why I do.</v>

1663
01:18:14.690 --> 01:18:19.690
<v Speaker 2>These are the sorts of crazy ass </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversations that Chris and Duncan and </v>

1664
01:18:19.690 --> 01:18:21.170
<v Speaker 2>Joe get into.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's why I like listening to those</v>

1665
01:18:21.171 --> 01:18:21.970
<v Speaker 2>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1666
01:18:22.250 --> 01:18:25.880
<v Speaker 2>or Wim Hoff or Graham Hancock and all </v>
<v Speaker 2>these guys are in the book.</v>

1667
01:18:26.030 --> 01:18:26.660
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>awesome.</v>

1668
01:18:26.720 --> 01:18:27.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1669
01:18:27.951 --> 01:18:28.190
<v Speaker 2>Man</v>

1670
01:18:28.480 --> 01:18:33.480
<v Speaker 6>Stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I thought about it because before I </v>

1671
01:18:33.480 --> 01:18:36.181
<v Speaker 6>started doing the podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would listen to recordings of like </v>

1672
01:18:36.181 --> 01:18:39.870
<v Speaker 6>lectures at Terence Mckenna would give </v>
<v Speaker 6>or a timothy leary or you know,</v>

1673
01:18:40.690 --> 01:18:42.460
<v Speaker 6>and there wasn't a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1674
01:18:42.461 --> 01:18:45.940
<v Speaker 6>you or listen to art bell having some </v>
<v Speaker 6>weird,</v>

1675
01:18:46.090 --> 01:18:48.580
<v Speaker 6>a ufo expert on or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1676
01:18:48.581 --> 01:18:51.670
<v Speaker 6>that's really what you had to listen to.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You didn't have very many choices.</v>

1677
01:18:52.030 --> 01:18:57.030
<v Speaker 6>And then I think about all the </v>
<v Speaker 6>conversations that I've been able to </v>

1678
01:18:57.030 --> 01:18:59.521
<v Speaker 6>have with guys like John Anthony West </v>
<v Speaker 6>with Graham Hancock and Randall Carlson </v>

1679
01:18:59.521 --> 01:19:03.451
<v Speaker 6>and Michael Shermer and you and Duncan </v>
<v Speaker 6>and I mean so many people had these </v>

1680
01:19:04.151 --> 01:19:06.460
<v Speaker 6>crazy conversations with them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That to me,</v>

1681
01:19:06.461 --> 01:19:08.200
<v Speaker 6>they've been.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1682
01:19:08.201 --> 01:19:13.201
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's shaped the way I look at </v>

1683
01:19:13.201 --> 01:19:15.691
<v Speaker 6>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's changed everything and so I feel </v>

1684
01:19:15.691 --> 01:19:15.770
<v Speaker 6>like I'm constantly getting educated,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>

1685
01:19:15.910 --> 01:19:18.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You set up your life as like,</v>

1686
01:19:19.810 --> 01:19:21.460
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not talking about myself,</v>

1687
01:19:21.461 --> 01:19:26.461
<v Speaker 2>but you've had guests who are some of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the smartest people in the world who </v>

1688
01:19:26.461 --> 01:19:29.410
<v Speaker 2>come to you to sit here and chat with </v>
<v Speaker 2>you for,</v>

1689
01:19:29.411 --> 01:19:30.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1690
01:19:30.041 --> 01:19:35.041
<v Speaker 2>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have set up an amazing little </v>

1691
01:19:35.041 --> 01:19:35.041
<v Speaker 2>educational institution</v>

1692
01:19:35.041 --> 01:19:37.050
<v Speaker 6>here at times.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Sometimes it's education,</v>

1693
01:19:37.910 --> 01:19:40.010
<v Speaker 6>sometimes it's chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's slow.</v>

1694
01:19:40.011 --> 01:19:45.011
<v Speaker 6>That's education certainly is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You learned about what we're like when </v>

1695
01:19:45.011 --> 01:19:48.881
<v Speaker 6>we're drunk,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's what it is is it's a fan.</v>

1696
01:19:49.150 --> 01:19:54.150
<v Speaker 6>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a thing and it's a thing that's </v>

1697
01:19:54.150 --> 01:19:54.150
<v Speaker 6>enjoyable to me.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like A.</v>

1698
01:19:54.150 --> 01:19:58.010
<v Speaker 6>It's like I like having all these </v>
<v Speaker 6>conversations so if I can record them </v>

1699
01:19:58.010 --> 01:19:58.280
<v Speaker 6>and they just put them out there and </v>
<v Speaker 6>other people like them.</v>

1700
01:19:58.650 --> 01:20:01.130
<v Speaker 6>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is a very rare,</v>

1701
01:20:01.190 --> 01:20:06.190
<v Speaker 6>a balanced sort of relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So to me there's no other way I'd get </v>

1702
01:20:06.190 --> 01:20:07.190
<v Speaker 6>like if I said to you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Hey Chris,</v>

1703
01:20:07.410 --> 01:20:07.980
<v Speaker 6>let's sit</v>

1704
01:20:07.980 --> 01:20:10.440
<v Speaker 3>down and talk for three hours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd be like,</v>

1705
01:20:10.441 --> 01:20:12.180
<v Speaker 3>I'm okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>

1706
01:20:12.181 --> 01:20:17.181
<v Speaker 3>I'll block off three hours for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can I look at my phone at all during </v>

1707
01:20:17.181 --> 01:20:17.181
<v Speaker 3>this time?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can I get up to go to the bathroom?</v>

1708
01:20:17.370 --> 01:20:20.910
<v Speaker 3>We would never have this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like as connected a conversation,</v>

1709
01:20:21.540 --> 01:20:26.540
<v Speaker 3>I just got another set of headphones to </v>
<v Speaker 3>give to my guests because the </v>

1710
01:20:27.420 --> 01:20:32.420
<v Speaker 3>extensively.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The main reason is I'm using handheld </v>

1711
01:20:32.420 --> 01:20:35.181
<v Speaker 3>now because my whole thing is mobile </v>
<v Speaker 3>right below occasionally come to my </v>

1712
01:20:35.181 --> 01:20:37.800
<v Speaker 3>place in Topanga,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but normally I go to them and they can't</v>

1713
01:20:37.801 --> 01:20:40.710
<v Speaker 3>hear when they're not here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I have to keep like going,</v>

1714
01:20:40.711 --> 01:20:41.220
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1715
01:20:41.221 --> 01:20:41.910
<v Speaker 3>the mic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1716
01:20:41.911 --> 01:20:46.911
<v Speaker 3>there are a lot of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not used to talking on Mike's </v>

1717
01:20:46.911 --> 01:20:49.130
<v Speaker 3>and all that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the other reason I got it is my </v>

1718
01:20:49.130 --> 01:20:51.450
<v Speaker 3>buddy kyle actually pointed out to me </v>
<v Speaker 3>that when you both have headphones,</v>

1719
01:20:51.451 --> 01:20:56.451
<v Speaker 3>you're both in a shared space and you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>much less likely to be thinking about </v>

1720
01:20:57.511 --> 01:21:00.030
<v Speaker 3>your phone or whatever because you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>both like,</v>

1721
01:21:00.090 --> 01:21:01.350
<v Speaker 3>I dunno what it does,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it,</v>

1722
01:21:01.380 --> 01:21:02.820
<v Speaker 3>it seals it off in a way.</v>

1723
01:21:02.880 --> 01:21:04.230
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We talked about that yesterday.</v>

1724
01:21:04.231 --> 01:21:09.231
<v Speaker 3>Actually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Me and Eddie Bravo talked about it </v>

1725
01:21:09.231 --> 01:21:09.231
<v Speaker 3>because he doesn't like to wear them </v>
<v Speaker 3>because he doesn't like the sound of his</v>

1726
01:21:09.231 --> 01:21:09.990
<v Speaker 3>own voice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>

1727
01:21:10.050 --> 01:21:11.250
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he and I are so comfortable.</v>

1728
01:21:11.251 --> 01:21:12.640
<v Speaker 3>We'd been friends for so long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't.</v>

1729
01:21:12.730 --> 01:21:17.730
<v Speaker 3>We didn't need to wear them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I feel like when you're having a </v>

1730
01:21:17.730 --> 01:21:18.300
<v Speaker 3>conversation with someone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it cuts out everything else.</v>

1731
01:21:18.360 --> 01:21:19.350
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just youtube,</v>

1732
01:21:19.380 --> 01:21:21.630
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no distractions in the room,</v>

1733
01:21:21.631 --> 01:21:24.870
<v Speaker 3>but if there were they would be less </v>
<v Speaker 3>distracting because the headphones.</v>

1734
01:21:25.100 --> 01:21:27.290
<v Speaker 3>Well that's the thing I'm out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like sitting in a,</v>

1735
01:21:27.291 --> 01:21:30.170
<v Speaker 3>in a campsite somewhere by a river or </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

1736
01:21:30.171 --> 01:21:33.010
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the handheld microphone too.</v>

1737
01:21:33.011 --> 01:21:35.730
<v Speaker 3>It was a big thing and if you get a mic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>picks up everything,</v>

1738
01:21:35.880 --> 01:21:37.830
<v Speaker 3>then they pick up everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything.</v>

1739
01:21:37.831 --> 01:21:39.690
<v Speaker 3>Like they pick up some shit over by the </v>
<v Speaker 3>outhouse,</v>

1740
01:21:39.691 --> 01:21:40.690
<v Speaker 3>you'd hear in the background.</v>

1741
01:21:41.130 --> 01:21:44.250
<v Speaker 3>It was using a lapel mics for awhile,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they were um,</v>

1742
01:21:44.260 --> 01:21:47.670
<v Speaker 3>the directional is too much and people </v>
<v Speaker 3>were complaining and like,</v>

1743
01:21:47.671 --> 01:21:48.900
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't in the car.</v>

1744
01:21:48.901 --> 01:21:51.720
<v Speaker 3>I can't hear you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I got the handheld.</v>

1745
01:21:51.900 --> 01:21:53.310
<v Speaker 3>It is an interesting thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1746
01:21:53.311 --> 01:21:58.311
<v Speaker 3>Because this is not something that it </v>
<v Speaker 3>production company would ever get </v>

1747
01:21:58.311 --> 01:22:00.090
<v Speaker 3>together and fund because they would say</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they did,</v>

1748
01:22:00.210 --> 01:22:04.350
<v Speaker 3>they'd have a sound guy and they'd have </v>
<v Speaker 3>a like half the fun is watching you.</v>

1749
01:22:04.351 --> 01:22:05.640
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>will this one sock these,</v>

1750
01:22:05.641 --> 01:22:07.230
<v Speaker 3>these mikes are bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1751
01:22:07.231 --> 01:22:08.790
<v Speaker 3>We're not doing that anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1752
01:22:08.880 --> 01:22:12.840
<v Speaker 3>we've done a few from an iphone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We used to do podcasts on a plane,</v>

1753
01:22:13.060 --> 01:22:14.150
<v Speaker 3>like we'd be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1754
01:22:14.280 --> 01:22:19.280
<v Speaker 3>me and Duncan are me and Ari or whoever </v>
<v Speaker 3>it was would be on a plane next to each </v>

1755
01:22:19.280 --> 01:22:19.280
<v Speaker 3>other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just take the iphone between us,</v>

1756
01:22:19.280 --> 01:22:23.870
<v Speaker 3>press record and start talking voice </v>
<v Speaker 3>notes and turn into a podcast and it's </v>

1757
01:22:23.870 --> 01:22:23.870
<v Speaker 3>not that bad.</v>

1758
01:22:24.240 --> 01:22:26.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did that recently in the van.</v>

1759
01:22:26.220 --> 01:22:27.780
<v Speaker 3>I was driving.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had some ideas.</v>

1760
01:22:27.781 --> 01:22:30.540
<v Speaker 3>I just grabbed my phone and started </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking into it and I threw it up.</v>

1761
01:22:30.840 --> 01:22:35.840
<v Speaker 3>People like it because they knew one </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing they know this is one of the </v>

1762
01:22:35.840 --> 01:22:39.441
<v Speaker 3>things that's appealing about podcasts </v>
<v Speaker 3>in general is that it's not produced </v>

1763
01:22:39.441 --> 01:22:39.570
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just this is what it is.</v>

1764
01:22:39.600 --> 01:22:44.600
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like you've got an idea and I'm </v>

1765
01:22:44.600 --> 01:22:46.491
<v Speaker 3>getting it right from Chris Ryan's head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going right from his head right in </v>

1766
01:22:46.491 --> 01:22:47.030
<v Speaker 3>that phone that's going right into my </v>
<v Speaker 3>ears.</v>

1767
01:22:47.040 --> 01:22:48.300
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no filters.</v>

1768
01:22:48.301 --> 01:22:53.301
<v Speaker 3>There's getting right into your head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the weirdest things about </v>

1769
01:22:53.301 --> 01:22:55.941
<v Speaker 3>podcasts in general,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that the intimacy of your voice in </v>

1770
01:22:55.941 --> 01:23:00.111
<v Speaker 3>someone else's head,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I'm sure when you meet them they </v>

1771
01:23:00.111 --> 01:23:00.111
<v Speaker 3>get weirded out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1772
01:23:00.111 --> 01:23:03.260
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people get really weird because</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got in their head and all of a </v>

1773
01:23:03.260 --> 01:23:03.260
<v Speaker 3>sudden you're right in front of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

1774
01:23:03.260 --> 01:23:04.320
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1775
01:23:04.321 --> 01:23:05.980
<v Speaker 3>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's strange like they</v>

1776
01:23:05.980 --> 01:23:07.810
<v Speaker 4>know you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

1777
01:23:08.350 --> 01:23:12.220
<v Speaker 4>they really do know you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not like fame where you're an actor</v>

1778
01:23:12.520 --> 01:23:13.270
<v Speaker 4>and people like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1779
01:23:13.271 --> 01:23:14.210
<v Speaker 4>I know your face.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

1780
01:23:14.260 --> 01:23:15.730
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But yeah,</v>

1781
01:23:15.731 --> 01:23:18.710
<v Speaker 4>I mean people really do know Joe Rogan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1782
01:23:19.010 --> 01:23:20.110
<v Speaker 4>Strangely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1783
01:23:20.470 --> 01:23:25.470
<v Speaker 4>So there are parts I know both of us </v>
<v Speaker 4>have parts of our lives we don't talk </v>

1784
01:23:25.470 --> 01:23:26.980
<v Speaker 4>about on the podcast specifically your </v>
<v Speaker 4>marriage.</v>

1785
01:23:26.981 --> 01:23:29.770
<v Speaker 4>I guess I don't like to talk too much,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but yeah,</v>

1786
01:23:30.610 --> 01:23:31.680
<v Speaker 4>I'm that way too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1787
01:23:31.930 --> 01:23:36.930
<v Speaker 4>my impulse is to talk about everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like on my impulse is like I got </v>

1788
01:23:36.930 --> 01:23:41.281
<v Speaker 4>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got no secrets because I feel like </v>

1789
01:23:41.281 --> 01:23:42.820
<v Speaker 4>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a revolutionary shamelessness.</v>

1790
01:23:43.500 --> 01:23:44.410
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1791
01:23:44.411 --> 01:23:48.040
<v Speaker 4>I feel like I feel so privileged and </v>
<v Speaker 4>largely thanks to you and Duncan.</v>

1792
01:23:48.041 --> 01:23:53.041
<v Speaker 4>Honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I started the podcast and you guys </v>

1793
01:23:53.041 --> 01:23:55.411
<v Speaker 4>did that shrimp parade thing and that </v>
<v Speaker 4>really built up my audience and to the </v>

1794
01:23:55.421 --> 01:24:00.421
<v Speaker 4>point now where it paid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's self sustaining and it's my main </v>

1795
01:24:00.421 --> 01:24:00.421
<v Speaker 4>gig.</v>

1796
01:24:00.421 --> 01:24:00.610
<v Speaker 4>That's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is awesome.</v>

1797
01:24:00.611 --> 01:24:02.380
<v Speaker 4>It's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's like,</v>

1798
01:24:02.381 --> 01:24:07.381
<v Speaker 4>I feel like there's a responsibility I </v>
<v Speaker 4>have in a way to express yourself </v>

1799
01:24:07.630 --> 01:24:12.630
<v Speaker 4>shamelessly because everybody else has a</v>
<v Speaker 4>job they can get fired from or a </v>

1800
01:24:13.421 --> 01:24:18.070
<v Speaker 4>marriage that they can get screwed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The wife can leave them or they can.</v>

1801
01:24:18.720 --> 01:24:21.880
<v Speaker 4>I'm in vulnerable and so I kind of feel </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1802
01:24:22.280 --> 01:24:24.430
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so the cost of that,</v>

1803
01:24:24.431 --> 01:24:29.431
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>every opportunity or every privilege </v>

1804
01:24:29.431 --> 01:24:31.360
<v Speaker 4>comes with a responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The responsibility is like I got to talk</v>

1805
01:24:31.361 --> 01:24:35.680
<v Speaker 4>about shit that other people don't talk </v>
<v Speaker 4>about so that it's out there.</v>

1806
01:24:35.820 --> 01:24:40.820
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so my impulse is to just say </v>

1807
01:24:40.820 --> 01:24:40.820
<v Speaker 4>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1808
01:24:40.820 --> 01:24:43.261
<v Speaker 4>and my sex life is really has been very </v>
<v Speaker 4>interesting and I'd like to talk about </v>

1809
01:24:43.601 --> 01:24:45.850
<v Speaker 4>it more,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I don't want to,</v>

1810
01:24:45.851 --> 01:24:50.851
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>other people never sort of said they </v>

1811
01:24:50.851 --> 01:24:50.851
<v Speaker 4>were down for that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1812
01:24:50.851 --> 01:24:50.851
<v Speaker 4>so</v>

1813
01:24:50.851 --> 01:24:55.390
<v Speaker 6>that too,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's magnified when you have children </v>

1814
01:24:55.390 --> 01:24:57.020
<v Speaker 6>because they have no say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well that's the vulnerability.</v>

1815
01:24:57.840 --> 01:24:59.250
<v Speaker 6>They put their kids out there and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

1816
01:24:59.251 --> 01:24:59.710
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>

1817
01:25:01.050 --> 01:25:02.460
<v Speaker 6>I'm not saying it's the worst thing to </v>
<v Speaker 6>do,</v>

1818
01:25:02.490 --> 01:25:06.190
<v Speaker 6>but it's not the child's choice.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And they're very young and you're making</v>

1819
01:25:06.191 --> 01:25:09.750
<v Speaker 6>a huge,</v>
<v Speaker 6>your look like whoever did what they did</v>

1820
01:25:09.751 --> 01:25:11.070
<v Speaker 6>to Michael Jackson,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1821
01:25:11.190 --> 01:25:16.190
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>One of the things that they did is they </v>

1822
01:25:16.190 --> 01:25:16.380
<v Speaker 6>made him famous way before he had any </v>
<v Speaker 6>idea what the fuck that meant.</v>

1823
01:25:16.500 --> 01:25:18.010
<v Speaker 6>And they profited off of it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1824
01:25:18.150 --> 01:25:19.630
<v Speaker 6>They kind of pimped them out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

1825
01:25:19.910 --> 01:25:21.770
<v Speaker 6>And that's kind of what's happened.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I destroyed him,</v>

1826
01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:23.880
<v Speaker 6>but ultimately the whole thing destroyed</v>
<v Speaker 6>him.</v>

1827
01:25:23.881 --> 01:25:25.320
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And um,</v>

1828
01:25:26.430 --> 01:25:28.920
<v Speaker 6>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to be a part of that.</v>

1829
01:25:28.980 --> 01:25:29.620
<v Speaker 6>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's no,</v>

1830
01:25:29.880 --> 01:25:31.800
<v Speaker 6>that's smart.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't think it's intelligent.</v>

1831
01:25:32.190 --> 01:25:35.670
<v Speaker 6>And I also don't,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is my real honest feelings.</v>

1832
01:25:35.940 --> 01:25:40.940
<v Speaker 6>I do not think that fame is a.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't think that people should aspire </v>

1833
01:25:41.281 --> 01:25:46.281
<v Speaker 6>to it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think it should be something that </v>

1834
01:25:46.281 --> 01:25:46.470
<v Speaker 6>happens if people like your work and </v>
<v Speaker 6>then it's cool,</v>

1835
01:25:46.471 --> 01:25:51.471
<v Speaker 6>it's fine,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I think there's way too much </v>

1836
01:25:51.471 --> 01:25:55.760
<v Speaker 6>emphasis put on just trying to get </v>
<v Speaker 6>attention and it's being rewarded and </v>

1837
01:25:57.121 --> 01:26:02.121
<v Speaker 6>supported in this weird way.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's nothing wrong with getting </v>

1838
01:26:02.121 --> 01:26:03.000
<v Speaker 6>attention,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it should make sense.</v>

1839
01:26:03.410 --> 01:26:04.280
<v Speaker 6>It should make sense.</v>

1840
01:26:04.280 --> 01:26:06.860
<v Speaker 5>There should be some reason.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And if it's out of balance,</v>

1841
01:26:07.750 --> 01:26:08.550
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you should,</v>

1842
01:26:08.580 --> 01:26:12.710
<v Speaker 5>you should probably look at like why?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why is it out of balance.</v>

1843
01:26:13.200 --> 01:26:18.200
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And lots of things that attract </v>

1844
01:26:18.200 --> 01:26:19.160
<v Speaker 4>attention are not things that we need.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We,</v>

1845
01:26:19.260 --> 01:26:20.930
<v Speaker 4>we want more of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1846
01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:22.410
<v Speaker 4>like conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

1847
01:26:22.470 --> 01:26:23.760
<v Speaker 4>conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a big one.</v>

1848
01:26:23.870 --> 01:26:28.130
<v Speaker 5>But it's also the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just fame itself.</v>

1849
01:26:28.700 --> 01:26:33.700
<v Speaker 5>One of the weirdest parts about it is </v>
<v Speaker 5>that you have to constantly be checking </v>

1850
01:26:34.161 --> 01:26:36.770
<v Speaker 5>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like all these people are nice to you.</v>

1851
01:26:37.040 --> 01:26:40.790
<v Speaker 5>All these people are saying nice things </v>
<v Speaker 5>to you or being mean to you.</v>

1852
01:26:40.860 --> 01:26:41.970
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of the like Dave,</v>

1853
01:26:41.980 --> 01:26:46.980
<v Speaker 5>all people that you don't even know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so you can't rely on them for your self </v>

1854
01:26:46.980 --> 01:26:48.620
<v Speaker 5>esteem and you certainly can't rely on </v>
<v Speaker 5>them for criticism.</v>

1855
01:26:48.890 --> 01:26:53.890
<v Speaker 5>You can't rely on them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People you don't even know that don't </v>

1856
01:26:53.890 --> 01:26:53.890
<v Speaker 5>care about you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1857
01:26:53.890 --> 01:26:53.890
<v Speaker 5>so you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

1858
01:26:53.890 --> 01:26:57.590
<v Speaker 5>you're in this weird position.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have to be very careful with who you</v>

1859
01:26:57.620 --> 01:27:02.620
<v Speaker 5>communicate with because one of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>weirdest things you'll see from famous </v>

1860
01:27:02.620 --> 01:27:05.801
<v Speaker 5>people is all the sudden they get this </v>
<v Speaker 5>very strange thing where they feel like </v>

1861
01:27:06.321 --> 01:27:09.080
<v Speaker 5>people are supposed to do things for </v>
<v Speaker 5>them and you know,</v>

1862
01:27:09.081 --> 01:27:14.081
<v Speaker 5>they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're not supposed to pay for things </v>

1863
01:27:14.081 --> 01:27:14.840
<v Speaker 5>and everything's supposed to be easy and</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're supposed to get that.</v>

1864
01:27:15.230 --> 01:27:16.640
<v Speaker 5>That's a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a weird one.</v>

1865
01:27:16.641 --> 01:27:18.980
<v Speaker 5>Like they don't respond to criticism.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1866
01:27:18.981 --> 01:27:21.920
<v Speaker 5>they don't understand that they're still</v>
<v Speaker 5>a human being in the middle of growth.</v>

1867
01:27:21.921 --> 01:27:22.970
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're a fucking star.</v>

1868
01:27:23.150 --> 01:27:25.780
<v Speaker 5>I'm a fucking star and I want this and I</v>
<v Speaker 5>want it</v>

1869
01:27:25.820 --> 01:27:27.250
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they just like,</v>

1870
01:27:27.260 --> 01:27:30.110
<v Speaker 4>what kind of fucking bullshit is this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you know who I am?</v>

1871
01:27:30.170 --> 01:27:30.910
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>

1872
01:27:30.940 --> 01:27:35.940
<v Speaker 4>We've seen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we've all seen like a version of that </v>

1873
01:27:35.940 --> 01:27:38.651
<v Speaker 4>right about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The problem though is that they know </v>

1874
01:27:39.471 --> 01:27:41.090
<v Speaker 4>that their shit stinks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1875
01:27:41.120 --> 01:27:43.820
<v Speaker 4>They know that they're human.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They know so they're.</v>

1876
01:27:43.821 --> 01:27:48.821
<v Speaker 4>So then they develop this sort of fraud,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a phobia that people are going to find </v>

1877
01:27:50.751 --> 01:27:52.970
<v Speaker 4>out what they really are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1878
01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:54.960
<v Speaker 4>I've seen this with fashion models,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1879
01:27:55.010 --> 01:27:58.570
<v Speaker 4>I used to hang out with a lot of fashion</v>
<v Speaker 4>models in Barcelona that,</v>

1880
01:27:58.571 --> 01:28:03.571
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that whole story where I lived in the </v>

1881
01:28:03.571 --> 01:28:03.571
<v Speaker 4>mansion with the fashion models.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you talk about that?</v>

1882
01:28:03.571 --> 01:28:03.590
<v Speaker 4>Could be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

1883
01:28:03.760 --> 01:28:06.230
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but looking track of what the fuck we've</v>

1884
01:28:06.231 --> 01:28:09.200
<v Speaker 4>talked about possible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's impossible.</v>

1885
01:28:10.150 --> 01:28:10.730
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anyway,</v>

1886
01:28:10.731 --> 01:28:12.420
<v Speaker 4>so uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1887
01:28:12.421 --> 01:28:17.421
<v Speaker 4>I fashioned model become fame,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wealth people who are extremely wealthy </v>

1888
01:28:17.421 --> 01:28:22.240
<v Speaker 4>and that gets back to the 70 grand a </v>
<v Speaker 4>year thing and the whole sort of </v>

1889
01:28:22.240 --> 01:28:22.640
<v Speaker 4>question of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1890
01:28:23.120 --> 01:28:24.020
<v Speaker 4>saturation,</v>

1891
01:28:24.150 --> 01:28:25.050
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what else it is,</v>

1892
01:28:25.600 --> 01:28:30.600
<v Speaker 5>it becomes a real problem with things </v>
<v Speaker 5>being too easy and life being like way </v>

1893
01:28:30.601 --> 01:28:35.601
<v Speaker 5>to a patterned like you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everything is very predictable in terms </v>

1894
01:28:35.731 --> 01:28:38.310
<v Speaker 5>of your success.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have plenty of money.</v>

1895
01:28:38.500 --> 01:28:42.680
<v Speaker 5>You have a adulation from fans without </v>
<v Speaker 5>any stress or direct.</v>

1896
01:28:42.730 --> 01:28:45.120
<v Speaker 5>Are you going to have a little bit of </v>
<v Speaker 5>stress in terms of like trying to manage</v>

1897
01:28:45.121 --> 01:28:50.121
<v Speaker 5>your career,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's nothing like trying to make it </v>

1898
01:28:50.121 --> 01:28:52.600
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if I'm ever going to make </v>

1899
01:28:52.600 --> 01:28:54.351
<v Speaker 5>it stress.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a totally different kind of </v>

1900
01:28:54.351 --> 01:28:56.001
<v Speaker 5>stress.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if I'm ever going to be a </v>

1901
01:28:56.001 --> 01:28:56.001
<v Speaker 5>success dress.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's real shit that goes away once you</v>

1902
01:28:56.001 --> 01:29:00.210
<v Speaker 5>definitely become Kanye West or whoever </v>
<v Speaker 5>the fuck you are and then you're subject</v>

1903
01:29:00.211 --> 01:29:02.070
<v Speaker 5>to your own demons because then you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>alone.</v>

1904
01:29:02.100 --> 01:29:04.680
<v Speaker 2>You're really alone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't even go to the grocery store.</v>

1905
01:29:04.870 --> 01:29:07.110
<v Speaker 2>You spend any time with Jim Carrey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1906
01:29:07.111 --> 01:29:09.420
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd love to meet that guy.</v>

1907
01:29:09.630 --> 01:29:11.910
<v Speaker 2>He seems like he's in a weird stage of </v>
<v Speaker 2>his life.</v>

1908
01:29:12.270 --> 01:29:16.260
<v Speaker 2>He seems to me like someone who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who you talked about,</v>

1909
01:29:16.290 --> 01:29:18.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get to that pinnacle and you have to</v>

1910
01:29:18.811 --> 01:29:20.480
<v Speaker 2>deal with your demons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1911
01:29:20.520 --> 01:29:25.520
<v Speaker 2>It seems like he's dealt with them and </v>
<v Speaker 2>now he's come out the other side and </v>

1912
01:29:25.681 --> 01:29:30.681
<v Speaker 2>he's in this very sort of this place of </v>
<v Speaker 2>wisdom and uh,</v>

1913
01:29:32.670 --> 01:29:34.100
<v Speaker 2>and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1914
01:29:34.130 --> 01:29:35.130
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think he,</v>

1915
01:29:35.430 --> 01:29:38.610
<v Speaker 2>he sounded.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Russell brand is another guy who I think</v>

1916
01:29:39.150 --> 01:29:44.150
<v Speaker 2>I really admire what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where they are in their lives and how </v>

1917
01:29:44.150 --> 01:29:48.051
<v Speaker 2>they got there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They sort of went through the fire and </v>

1918
01:29:48.051 --> 01:29:48.840
<v Speaker 2>they've come out the other side somehow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rustled certainly has.</v>

1919
01:29:48.841 --> 01:29:50.000
<v Speaker 2>I know Russell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

1920
01:29:50.040 --> 01:29:50.820
<v Speaker 2>he's a sweetie.</v>

1921
01:29:51.090 --> 01:29:56.090
<v Speaker 2>He really is a super sweet guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like genuine too and really trying to </v>

1922
01:29:56.090 --> 01:29:58.470
<v Speaker 2>like be a better person and a better </v>
<v Speaker 2>human and you know,</v>

1923
01:29:58.770 --> 01:30:00.900
<v Speaker 2>I don't agree with him on everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He gets a little social.</v>

1924
01:30:00.901 --> 01:30:05.901
<v Speaker 2>Justice warriors are on some things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think it's just because he wants </v>

1925
01:30:05.901 --> 01:30:09.351
<v Speaker 2>to do good and he's like leaning towards</v>
<v Speaker 2>good and he's leaning towards love and </v>

1926
01:30:09.351 --> 01:30:10.260
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all for the right reasons.</v>

1927
01:30:10.261 --> 01:30:12.090
<v Speaker 2>Like every,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if I don't agree with them,</v>

1928
01:30:12.091 --> 01:30:17.091
<v Speaker 2>I see how he's thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And even if I don't agree with Ms Dot </v>

1929
01:30:17.091 --> 01:30:17.091
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] do not agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a hard.</v>

1930
01:30:17.091 --> 01:30:17.091
<v Speaker 2>Do not agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>

1931
01:30:17.091 --> 01:30:17.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1932
01:30:18.030 --> 01:30:20.670
<v Speaker 2>He's a fascinating guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

1933
01:30:20.671 --> 01:30:21.810
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if Jesus came back,</v>

1934
01:30:21.811 --> 01:30:25.350
<v Speaker 2>he'd be Russell brand probably.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck a few less checks.</v>

1935
01:30:26.710 --> 01:30:31.710
<v Speaker 2>Maybe Jesus would go just swinging dick </v>
<v Speaker 2>all over the place just to remove </v>

1936
01:30:31.710 --> 01:30:31.710
<v Speaker 2>everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have their ego.</v>

1937
01:30:31.710 --> 01:30:33.330
<v Speaker 2>Everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't possess these women.</v>

1938
01:30:33.660 --> 01:30:34.730
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago I,</v>

1939
01:30:35.040 --> 01:30:36.420
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I came back from Asia,</v>

1940
01:30:36.421 --> 01:30:41.421
<v Speaker 2>I was in Asia for a couple of years and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I visited my best buddy in Paris and </v>

<v Speaker 2>And some backstreet in Paris,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which freaked out the per regions of </v>

1943
01:30:47.181 --> 01:30:49.440
<v Speaker 2>course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And my buddy's like the opposite of me.</v>

1944
01:30:49.441 --> 01:30:51.960
<v Speaker 2>He's religious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's disciplined,</v>

1945
01:30:51.990 --> 01:30:54.870
<v Speaker 2>he's speaks seven languages,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1946
01:30:55.080 --> 01:30:58.740
<v Speaker 2>musical prodigy.</v>

<v Speaker 2>he was spock,</v>

1948
01:31:00.570 --> 01:31:05.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that kind of dynamic half your </v>

1949
01:31:05.570 --> 01:31:05.570
<v Speaker 2>audience wouldn't even know who we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about it.</v>

1950
01:31:05.570 --> 01:31:06.810
<v Speaker 2>They're not sad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

1951
01:31:06.811 --> 01:31:08.520
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

1952
01:31:08.521 --> 01:31:10.320
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which explains why I've always wanted to</v>

1953
01:31:10.321 --> 01:31:14.370
<v Speaker 2>fuck a green woman that got this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

1954
01:31:14.400 --> 01:31:15.600
<v Speaker 2>he said it to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

1955
01:31:15.660 --> 01:31:17.220
<v Speaker 2>Chris,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I figured you out man,</v>

1956
01:31:17.270 --> 01:31:18.690
<v Speaker 2>as what's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the deal?</v>

1957
01:31:18.690 --> 01:31:20.400
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're the anti monk,</v>

1958
01:31:21.030 --> 01:31:21.660
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you mean?</v>

1959
01:31:21.661 --> 01:31:26.661
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>monks cut themselves off from the </v>

1960
01:31:26.661 --> 01:31:29.310
<v Speaker 2>temptations of life in order to pursue a</v>
<v Speaker 2>spiritual path.</v>

1961
01:31:29.750 --> 01:31:31.980
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're pursuing a spiritual path,</v>

1962
01:31:31.981 --> 01:31:34.740
<v Speaker 2>but it's by way of the temptations of </v>
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

1963
01:31:34.741 --> 01:31:39.741
<v Speaker 2>You immerse yourself in them because in </v>
<v Speaker 2>those days I was doing a lot of drugs </v>

1964
01:31:39.741 --> 01:31:39.741
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

1965
01:31:40.260 --> 01:31:42.240
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's right.</v>

1966
01:31:42.630 --> 01:31:47.630
<v Speaker 2>And in Buddhism there is a path of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>drunken guru right the,</v>

1967
01:31:48.780 --> 01:31:53.780
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is a path of sex and altered </v>

1968
01:31:53.780 --> 01:31:56.390
<v Speaker 2>states of consciousness and sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1969
01:31:56.400 --> 01:32:01.150
<v Speaker 2>William Blake said the palace of wisdom </v>
<v Speaker 2>lies at the end of the road of excess.</v>

1970
01:32:02.170 --> 01:32:04.750
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so someone like Russell brand,</v>

1971
01:32:04.751 --> 01:32:07.440
<v Speaker 3>I think that's his path.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's gone through the,</v>

1972
01:32:07.470 --> 01:32:12.470
<v Speaker 3>the addictions and the orgies and all </v>
<v Speaker 3>that stuff that a lot of people think </v>

1973
01:32:12.470 --> 01:32:14.080
<v Speaker 3>would make them happy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

1974
01:32:14.081 --> 01:32:18.520
<v Speaker 3>check those boxes like now that didn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>do it in a way that very few humans ever</v>

1975
01:32:18.521 --> 01:32:23.521
<v Speaker 3>get to check them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Family is a beautiful man and a </v>

1976
01:32:23.521 --> 01:32:24.190
<v Speaker 3>superstar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he came on the other side and became</v>

1977
01:32:24.191 --> 01:32:27.070
<v Speaker 3>this really conscious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very spiritual person.</v>

1978
01:32:27.420 --> 01:32:30.010
<v Speaker 3>And very humble and a sweetie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nice guy.</v>

1979
01:32:30.040 --> 01:32:34.600
<v Speaker 3>I think humility is what you find if you</v>
<v Speaker 3>get through to the other side.</v>

1980
01:32:34.660 --> 01:32:35.440
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think so.</v>

1981
01:32:35.920 --> 01:32:40.920
<v Speaker 3>I think if you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But even when you get through the other </v>

1982
01:32:40.920 --> 01:32:40.920
<v Speaker 3>side,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like there's no,</v>

1983
01:32:40.920 --> 01:32:44.430
<v Speaker 3>there's no destination.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not like a spot you get to like </v>

1984
01:32:44.430 --> 01:32:44.740
<v Speaker 3>find that can relax.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm here.</v>

1985
01:32:44.790 --> 01:32:46.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well he's used that phrase a minute ago.</v>

1986
01:32:46.900 --> 01:32:47.670
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1987
01:32:47.780 --> 01:32:49.540
<v Speaker 3>trying to make it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1988
01:32:49.600 --> 01:32:54.600
<v Speaker 3>make it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's as if you'll make it and </v>

1989
01:32:54.600 --> 01:32:55.540
<v Speaker 3>then you'll have it made,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1990
01:32:55.550 --> 01:32:56.470
<v Speaker 3>like what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

1991
01:32:56.500 --> 01:32:59.680
<v Speaker 3>what did we make?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's made that make it thing is really</v>

1992
01:32:59.681 --> 01:33:01.390
<v Speaker 3>for a comic is just this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1993
01:33:01.400 --> 01:33:06.250
<v Speaker 3>the high likelihood of success is always</v>
<v Speaker 3>looming over you.</v>

1994
01:33:06.550 --> 01:33:09.390
<v Speaker 3>And what is success?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Being able to flick special.</v>

1995
01:33:09.920 --> 01:33:13.060
<v Speaker 3>I'm not even just being able to work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just being a working,</v>

1996
01:33:13.390 --> 01:33:18.390
<v Speaker 3>working comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just paying your rent with your </v>

1997
01:33:18.390 --> 01:33:18.390
<v Speaker 3>standard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was always the dream.</v>

1998
01:33:18.390 --> 01:33:19.870
<v Speaker 3>Like every comic that starts out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they're being honest.</v>

1999
01:33:19.970 --> 01:33:23.030
<v Speaker 3>Fitzsimmons and I have talked about this</v>
<v Speaker 3>a hundred times because it was,</v>

2000
01:33:23.350 --> 01:33:26.410
<v Speaker 3>we'd never thought of a career.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean if it fits him is this one,</v>

2001
01:33:26.411 --> 01:33:30.220
<v Speaker 3>I think he's won at least two emmy's for</v>
<v Speaker 3>writing.</v>

2002
01:33:30.970 --> 01:33:35.970
<v Speaker 3>Brilliant guy and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were just two dorks to 21 year old </v>

2003
01:33:36.521 --> 01:33:39.200
<v Speaker 3>dorks hanging out together in Boston and</v>
<v Speaker 3>we did.</v>

2004
01:33:39.580 --> 01:33:42.000
<v Speaker 3>You were a fucking martial arts expert </v>
<v Speaker 3>in those.</v>

2005
01:33:42.030 --> 01:33:43.450
<v Speaker 3>A martial arts expert.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was a Dork.</v>

2006
01:33:43.451 --> 01:33:45.350
<v Speaker 3>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would get nervous talking.</v>

2007
01:33:45.370 --> 01:33:48.610
<v Speaker 3>I've talked about this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never could figure out why I freak out</v>

2008
01:33:48.790 --> 01:33:50.680
<v Speaker 3>when I would be about to talk to a bank </v>
<v Speaker 3>teller,</v>

2009
01:33:50.920 --> 01:33:53.500
<v Speaker 3>like walking up to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd get like social anxiety.</v>

2010
01:33:53.860 --> 01:33:55.350
<v Speaker 3>I would know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was nervous.</v>

2011
01:33:55.360 --> 01:33:57.190
<v Speaker 3>It's not a good place to look.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nervous.</v>

2012
01:33:57.380 --> 01:33:57.730
<v Speaker 3>Not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2013
01:33:57.731 --> 01:33:59.290
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2014
01:33:59.320 --> 01:34:02.380
<v Speaker 3>but back then it didn't make sense </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I was fighting and I would still</v>

2015
01:34:02.381 --> 01:34:06.670
<v Speaker 3>get nervous talking to like any person </v>
<v Speaker 3>who is in an official person,</v>

2016
01:34:07.330 --> 01:34:11.260
<v Speaker 3>any person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a teacher or a principal or anybody</v>

2017
01:34:11.261 --> 01:34:14.320
<v Speaker 3>that authority and authority figure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was super nervous talking to them,</v>

2018
01:34:14.720 --> 01:34:19.720
<v Speaker 3>but my wife gets out way around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyone wearing a uniform freaks her out </v>

2019
01:34:19.720 --> 01:34:20.650
<v Speaker 3>because she was in a war when she was a </v>
<v Speaker 3>kid.</v>

2020
01:34:20.680 --> 01:34:23.500
<v Speaker 3>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like immigration guys.</v>

<v Speaker 3>she starts shaking and say workers.</v>

2022

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I hear you man.</v>

2024
01:34:27.880 --> 01:34:29.800
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uniform means uniform behavior,</v>

2025
01:34:30.250 --> 01:34:31.540
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uniform me.</v>

2026
01:34:31.580 --> 01:34:36.310
<v Speaker 3>Chicken goes sideways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When's the last time you wore a tie into</v>

2027
01:34:36.750 --> 01:34:41.750
<v Speaker 3>uniforms?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Probably when I was taking the photos </v>

2028
01:34:41.750 --> 01:34:45.380
<v Speaker 3>for my 19,</v>
<v Speaker 3>99 cd cover,</v>

2029
01:34:45.690 --> 01:34:48.220
<v Speaker 3>real seedy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I decided to dress like a,</v>

2030
01:34:48.340 --> 01:34:51.990
<v Speaker 3>like old school.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Frank Sinatra just decided when I.</v>

2031
01:34:52.090 --> 01:34:57.090
<v Speaker 3>When I made the CD,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was thinking I never wear a tie and a </v>

2032
01:34:57.090 --> 01:34:57.980
<v Speaker 3>suit and a tie to be fun if I just </v>
<v Speaker 3>decided to wear a suit and a</v>

2033
01:34:57.980 --> 01:34:59.630
<v Speaker 2>tie for the cover of this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's it right there.</v>

2034
01:34:59.870 --> 01:35:04.870
<v Speaker 2>That's probably brad pack the last time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be some day.</v>

2035
01:35:07.730 --> 01:35:12.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the theme song to my podcast is </v>

2036
01:35:12.730 --> 01:35:14.620

<v Speaker 2>I don't want to give the end away,</v>

2037
01:35:14.710 --> 01:35:17.210
<v Speaker 2>but you're going to die one day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good song.</v>

2038
01:35:17.211 --> 01:35:19.610
<v Speaker 2>Carpet a fucking DMV.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2040
01:35:20.930 --> 01:35:22.910
<v Speaker 2>don't dwell on it too much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll freak out.</v>

2041
01:35:23.090 --> 01:35:24.290
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2042
01:35:24.291 --> 01:35:27.470
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think every young man should shave his</v>

2043
01:35:27.471 --> 01:35:30.620
<v Speaker 2>head like at 21 or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shaved your head.</v>

2044
01:35:31.040 --> 01:35:36.040
<v Speaker 2>See yourself bald for a month or however</v>
<v Speaker 2>long it takes to grow back and it's </v>

2045
01:35:36.040 --> 01:35:36.440
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2046
01:35:36.500 --> 01:35:41.500
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to worry about Ted's </v>

2047
01:35:41.500 --> 01:35:41.500
<v Speaker 2>though will say this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you have a normal head.</v>

2048
01:35:41.540 --> 01:35:43.220
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never shaved my head.</v>

2049
01:35:43.221 --> 01:35:44.060
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a friend.</v>

2050
01:35:44.061 --> 01:35:49.061
<v Speaker 2>It looks like his kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his parents never picked him up for the </v>

2051
01:35:49.061 --> 01:35:50.300
<v Speaker 2>first year and otherwise to just let </v>
<v Speaker 2>them lay down on a flat marble pillow.</v>

2052
01:35:51.050 --> 01:35:56.050
<v Speaker 2>His head is flat like a fucking pizza is</v>
<v Speaker 2>poor bastard on the top or the back of </v>

2053
01:35:56.120 --> 01:35:56.870
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's flat.</v>

2054
01:35:56.871 --> 01:36:00.650
<v Speaker 2>I think his parents just ignore the shit</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of him and he's got a flat head.</v>

2055
01:36:00.680 --> 01:36:03.230
<v Speaker 2>You know about the flathead Indians.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which ones are those?</v>

2056
01:36:03.350 --> 01:36:06.950
<v Speaker 2>There was a up in Idaho that area.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Northern.</v>

2057
01:36:07.010 --> 01:36:07.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2058
01:36:07.550 --> 01:36:09.080
<v Speaker 2>they would put.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

2059
01:36:09.710 --> 01:36:14.710
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They put a board on the baby's head </v>

2060
01:36:14.710 --> 01:36:16.520
<v Speaker 2>because the heads are so malleable and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then tighten it and they look like </v>

2061
01:36:16.520 --> 01:36:18.260
<v Speaker 2>coneheads,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like scare the fuck out of anybody.</v>

2062
01:36:18.410 --> 01:36:22.310
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you saw those dudes riding up </v>
<v Speaker 2>war paint.</v>

2063
01:36:22.680 --> 01:36:23.660
<v Speaker 2>Flatheads.</v>

2064
01:36:24.010 --> 01:36:25.800
<v Speaker 5>And that was a thing about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2065
01:36:26.120 --> 01:36:28.160
<v Speaker 5>some of the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think was it,</v>

2066
01:36:28.190 --> 01:36:33.190
<v Speaker 5>was it Peru where they would do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they would find a lot of these skulls </v>

2067
01:36:33.190 --> 01:36:35.330
<v Speaker 5>from a certain period of time that had </v>
<v Speaker 5>been elongated and you know,</v>

2068
01:36:35.331 --> 01:36:37.700
<v Speaker 5>the alien people went nutty.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like this is it,</v>

2069
01:36:37.970 --> 01:36:42.970
<v Speaker 5>this is evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 5>evidence of contact the aliens they've </v>

2070
01:36:42.970 --> 01:36:44.540
<v Speaker 5>been here,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's just boards.</v>

2071
01:36:44.630 --> 01:36:47.480
<v Speaker 5>They just put boards in the side of </v>
<v Speaker 5>their heads and stretched her heads up.</v>

2072
01:36:47.520 --> 01:36:52.520
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They think they might've even been </v>

2073
01:36:52.520 --> 01:36:52.520
<v Speaker 5>trying to emulate one of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

2074
01:36:52.520 --> 01:36:56.980
<v Speaker 5>originally the idea was bounced about </v>
<v Speaker 5>that someone in the royal family in </v>

2075
01:36:58.280 --> 01:37:02.900
<v Speaker 5>Egypt had deformities.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that was one of the things that said</v>

2076
01:37:02.901 --> 01:37:07.901
<v Speaker 5>about king Tut.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like King Tut was not a healthy person </v>

2077
01:37:07.901 --> 01:37:12.520
<v Speaker 5>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He might may very well have been the </v>

2078
01:37:12.520 --> 01:37:14.030
<v Speaker 5>product of incest and that there was </v>
<v Speaker 5>some gender.</v>

2079
01:37:14.031 --> 01:37:14.960
<v Speaker 5>Do you remember reading about this?</v>

2080
01:37:15.110 --> 01:37:15.410
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2081
01:37:15.411 --> 01:37:18.110
<v Speaker 2>I know about the incest in the options.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2082
01:37:18.220 --> 01:37:21.910
<v Speaker 5>That some of the like heads when you see</v>
<v Speaker 5>people like with like,</v>

2083
01:37:21.911 --> 01:37:26.911
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>elongated heads and hieroglyphs and </v>

2084
01:37:26.911 --> 01:37:29.281
<v Speaker 5>images,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they might have actually done that to </v>

2085
01:37:29.281 --> 01:37:31.300
<v Speaker 5>try to replicate someone who had </v>
<v Speaker 5>something fucked up to normalize it,</v>

2086
01:37:31.360 --> 01:37:35.680
<v Speaker 5>which might have been like a royal who </v>
<v Speaker 5>had been like look at their debts.</v>

2087
01:37:35.681 --> 01:37:37.540
<v Speaker 5>His head.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's his actual head.</v>

2088
01:37:38.450 --> 01:37:39.760
<v Speaker 5>So on the left.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2089
01:37:40.980 --> 01:37:42.920
<v Speaker 5>That's to tongue cut.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is that his real head?</v>

2090
01:37:44.890 --> 01:37:45.940
<v Speaker 2>Peru,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Peru.</v>

2091
01:37:46.080 --> 01:37:46.810
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are giants</v>

2092
01:37:46.810 --> 01:37:48.510
<v Speaker 5>science goals.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But they have.</v>

2093
01:37:48.630 --> 01:37:53.630
<v Speaker 5>They have King Tut's head too though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You see if you can google king Tut's at </v>

2094
01:37:53.630 --> 01:37:56.030
<v Speaker 5>the ones improved.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They know they're pretty like 90</v>

2095
01:37:56.120 --> 01:37:59.010
<v Speaker 6>with a high degree of certainty.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't wanna give you a number,</v>

2096
01:37:59.160 --> 01:38:03.200
<v Speaker 6>but that they use boards and and example</v>
<v Speaker 6>of that is in Spanish.</v>

2097
01:38:04.220 --> 01:38:09.220
<v Speaker 6>Look at what tufts had.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Must've looked like it was all fucking </v>

2098
01:38:09.220 --> 01:38:09.220
<v Speaker 6>weird.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was all stretched out.</v>

2099
01:38:09.220 --> 01:38:10.650
<v Speaker 6>Like look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like if you saw,</v>

2100
01:38:10.680 --> 01:38:14.490
<v Speaker 6>if you saw that on the ship of a </v>
<v Speaker 6>spaceship on the deck,</v>

2101
01:38:14.760 --> 01:38:16.110
<v Speaker 6>like walking around and I'm like Oh my </v>
<v Speaker 6>God,</v>

2102
01:38:16.111 --> 01:38:18.150
<v Speaker 6>that's the alien.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh he must be from another planet.</v>

2103
01:38:18.240 --> 01:38:19.860
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like if you were on a spaceship,</v>

2104
01:38:20.250 --> 01:38:22.780
<v Speaker 6>say if you watch star trek and that dude</v>
<v Speaker 6>walks by like,</v>

2105
01:38:22.790 --> 01:38:27.790
<v Speaker 6>well for sure that dude wants to be </v>
<v Speaker 6>playing someone from another Martini on </v>

2106
01:38:27.790 --> 01:38:29.130
<v Speaker 6>his head.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The top of his head is flat.</v>

2107
01:38:29.370 --> 01:38:34.370
<v Speaker 6>There's always an extra brain.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It looks like there's like 10 percent </v>

2108
01:38:34.370 --> 01:38:34.370
<v Speaker 6>extra brain.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Maybe more.</v>

2109
01:38:34.370 --> 01:38:36.330
<v Speaker 6>What?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What the fuck is going on back there?</v>

2110
01:38:37.350 --> 01:38:42.120
<v Speaker 6>Here's the flathead Indians.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is a painting of Caitlin did at the</v>

2111
01:38:42.121 --> 01:38:45.900
<v Speaker 6>babies that would make you very non </v>
<v Speaker 6>aerodynamic.</v>

2112
01:38:46.720 --> 01:38:51.630
<v Speaker 6>You'd be like a land rover defender,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like a big flat square thing.</v>

2113
01:38:51.690 --> 01:38:54.780
<v Speaker 6>Similar schools though.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh Wow.</v>

2114
01:38:56.490 --> 01:39:01.490
<v Speaker 6>That normalizing crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Looking in a royal weirdness.</v>

2115
01:39:01.920 --> 01:39:04.770
<v Speaker 6>You ever hear Spanish people speak?</v>
<v Speaker 6>They have the list.</v>

2116
01:39:05.750 --> 01:39:10.750
<v Speaker 6>Will they say that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Because one of the kings had a list and </v>

2117
01:39:10.750 --> 01:39:12.900
<v Speaker 6>then all the court deers started </v>
<v Speaker 6>replicating it to seem cool.</v>

2118
01:39:13.050 --> 01:39:18.050
<v Speaker 6>You had told me about that and I had </v>
<v Speaker 6>forgotten when it came up the other day </v>

2119
01:39:18.050 --> 01:39:18.830
<v Speaker 6>when someone was bringing up a beat and </v>
<v Speaker 6>then.</v>

2120
01:39:19.580 --> 01:39:24.580
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then I remembered it after the </v>

2121
01:39:24.580 --> 01:39:24.580
<v Speaker 6>podcast was over.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2122
01:39:24.580 --> 01:39:25.320
<v Speaker 6>I don't know that that's true that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

2123
01:39:25.350 --> 01:39:29.310
<v Speaker 6>I haven't looked it up if it's </v>
<v Speaker 6>historically accurate or even if there's</v>

2124
01:39:29.311 --> 01:39:32.040
<v Speaker 6>a way to know because there are no </v>
<v Speaker 6>recordings.</v>

2125
01:39:32.040 --> 01:39:33.720
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do you know the powdered wig one?</v>

2126
01:39:34.230 --> 01:39:35.140
<v Speaker 6>Do you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

2127
01:39:35.200 --> 01:39:36.210
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's the best.</v>

2128
01:39:36.211 --> 01:39:38.280
<v Speaker 6>Dad is a weird one that came from </v>
<v Speaker 6>syphilis.</v>

2129
01:39:38.400 --> 01:39:39.450
<v Speaker 6>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2130
01:39:39.451 --> 01:39:39.840
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>

2131
01:39:39.841 --> 01:39:40.710
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>How?</v>

2132
01:39:40.780 --> 01:39:42.670
<v Speaker 6>Because men started getting syphilis,</v>
<v Speaker 6>find,</v>

2133
01:39:42.750 --> 01:39:44.700
<v Speaker 6>find out what year it was.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I forget what year.</v>

2134
01:39:44.701 --> 01:39:47.940
<v Speaker 6>We just brought it up recently,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but there was a royal family,</v>

2135
01:39:48.540 --> 01:39:53.540
<v Speaker 6>I think two brothers.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They both had syphilis and they started </v>

2136
01:39:53.540 --> 01:39:54.810
<v Speaker 6>losing their hair and a lot of men were </v>
<v Speaker 6>losing their hair to syphilis back then.</v>

2137
01:39:54.811 --> 01:39:56.550
<v Speaker 6>They just had it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Nobody knew what the fuck it was.</v>

2138
01:39:56.551 --> 01:40:01.551
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>So they would make wigs and the more </v>

2139
01:40:01.551 --> 01:40:03.120
<v Speaker 6>expensive,</v>
<v Speaker 6>more expensive the wig was,</v>

2140
01:40:03.150 --> 01:40:08.150
<v Speaker 6>the bigger would be.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So the really rich people would be big </v>

2141
01:40:08.150 --> 01:40:08.150
<v Speaker 6>wigs,</v>
<v Speaker 6>big wigs.</v>

2142
01:40:08.150 --> 01:40:12.891
<v Speaker 6>That's where big waves come from and </v>
<v Speaker 6>they literally put this style on to mask</v>

2143
01:40:13.741 --> 01:40:15.870
<v Speaker 6>the effects of syphilis.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Jesus,</v>

2144
01:40:16.170 --> 01:40:17.130
<v Speaker 6>it's a great story.</v>

2145
01:40:17.160 --> 01:40:19.230
<v Speaker 6>I didn't know syphilis made your hair </v>
<v Speaker 6>fell fall.</v>

2146
01:40:19.231 --> 01:40:19.740
<v Speaker 6>Fall.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2147
01:40:19.741 --> 01:40:21.480
<v Speaker 6>You've teeth rot out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're falling apart,</v>

2148
01:40:21.481 --> 01:40:26.481
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And your nervous system gets shoot </v>

2149
01:40:26.481 --> 01:40:29.250
<v Speaker 6>shooting.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're rotten ges into somebody and </v>

2150
01:40:29.250 --> 01:40:31.011
<v Speaker 6>given it to them too.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And you don't even know what the hell's </v>

2151
01:40:31.011 --> 01:40:31.011
<v Speaker 6>going on.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Louis the 14th.</v>

2152
01:40:31.011 --> 01:40:32.640
<v Speaker 6>He was only 17 when his mom started </v>
<v Speaker 6>thinning.</v>

2153
01:40:33.350 --> 01:40:35.520
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I'm 16,</v>

2154
01:40:35.521 --> 01:40:38.190
<v Speaker 6>Fifty five when the King of France </v>
<v Speaker 6>started losing his hair.</v>

2155
01:40:39.360 --> 01:40:39.970
<v Speaker 6>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2156
01:40:40.030 --> 01:40:42.200
<v Speaker 6>if you scroll down,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it goes into the,</v>

2157
01:40:42.220 --> 01:40:46.260
<v Speaker 6>the whole syphilis thing we get out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So where,</v>

2158
01:40:46.270 --> 01:40:49.500
<v Speaker 6>where's the syphilis part mentioned?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Up above that.</v>

2159
01:40:49.501 --> 01:40:50.890
<v Speaker 6>He probably had buck and crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

2160
01:40:50.900 --> 01:40:53.710
<v Speaker 6>brother's head stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Apparently everybody it back then.</v>

2161
01:40:53.750 --> 01:40:54.100
<v Speaker 6>And you just</v>

2162
01:40:54.100 --> 01:40:56.530
<v Speaker 3>imagine these people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean they only lived to be 30.</v>

2163
01:40:56.770 --> 01:41:01.770
<v Speaker 3>The syphilis outbreak sparked a surge </v>
<v Speaker 3>and wig making victims hid their </v>

2164
01:41:01.770 --> 01:41:06.631
<v Speaker 3>baldness as well as bloody sores that </v>
<v Speaker 3>scoured their faces with wigs made out </v>

2165
01:41:06.631 --> 01:41:10.951
<v Speaker 3>of horse goat or human hair.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Perutz were also created a coded rather </v>

2166
01:41:10.951 --> 01:41:15.721
<v Speaker 3>with powder sentence with lavender or </v>
<v Speaker 3>orange to hide any funky aromas.</v>

2167
01:41:15.970 --> 01:41:18.850
<v Speaker 3>Although common wigs were not exactly </v>
<v Speaker 3>stylish,</v>

2168
01:41:19.180 --> 01:41:23.530
<v Speaker 3>they were just a shameful necessity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the King of France started losing his</v>

2169
01:41:23.531 --> 01:41:26.740
<v Speaker 3>hair and 1655.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's when everybody hopped on.</v>

2170
01:41:26.741 --> 01:41:29.290
<v Speaker 3>And his cousin Charles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the second to the same thing,</v>

2171
01:41:29.291 --> 01:41:30.640
<v Speaker 3>both men likely had syphilis.</v>

2172
01:41:33.580 --> 01:41:38.580
<v Speaker 3>Syphilis created a whole,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a thing where like judges would </v>

2173
01:41:38.580 --> 01:41:39.940
<v Speaker 3>wear those wigs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>powdered wigs.</v>

2174
01:41:39.980 --> 01:41:41.650
<v Speaker 3>They would look like they were </v>
<v Speaker 3>important.</v>

2175
01:41:41.651 --> 01:41:43.420
<v Speaker 3>People look at my wig,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2176
01:41:43.421 --> 01:41:46.510
<v Speaker 3>we're doing right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tribalizing right now.</v>

2177
01:41:46.600 --> 01:41:48.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we're looking at our own culture,</v>

2178
01:41:49.120 --> 01:41:50.620
<v Speaker 3>British culture in this case,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

2179
01:41:51.010 --> 01:41:56.010
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and seeing how it's all this arbitrary </v>

2180
01:41:56.010 --> 01:41:56.560
<v Speaker 3>silliness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's travel.</v>

2181
01:41:56.590 --> 01:41:58.760
<v Speaker 3>That's what travel does for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2182
01:41:58.780 --> 01:42:03.780
<v Speaker 3>because you see it in other cultures and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you look back at your own and </v>

2183
01:42:03.780 --> 01:42:03.780
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh shit,</v>

2184
01:42:03.780 --> 01:42:05.590
<v Speaker 3>we do weird shit to fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're all weird.</v>

2185
01:42:05.591 --> 01:42:08.460
<v Speaker 3>There is no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like the uh,</v>

2186
01:42:08.830 --> 01:42:13.830
<v Speaker 3>what is an Einstein right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That there's no fixed point from which </v>

2187
01:42:13.830 --> 01:42:15.580
<v Speaker 3>to observe anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're always on a moving.</v>

2188
01:42:15.790 --> 01:42:20.790
<v Speaker 3>Your perspective is always mobile.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there is no objective truth.</v>

2189
01:42:21.370 --> 01:42:26.370
<v Speaker 3>Culturally it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all looking at one thing from </v>

2190
01:42:26.370 --> 01:42:26.370
<v Speaker 3>another thing in both of them are </v>
<v Speaker 3>moving.</v>

2191
01:42:26.800 --> 01:42:28.360
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love that shit.</v>

2192
01:42:28.480 --> 01:42:29.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because,</v>

2193
01:42:30.040 --> 01:42:32.320
<v Speaker 3>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it leads to humility.</v>

2194
01:42:32.440 --> 01:42:33.610
<v Speaker 3>I think so too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2195
01:42:33.910 --> 01:42:36.730
<v Speaker 3>I think all roads lead to humility.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ultimately,</v>

2196
01:42:36.731 --> 01:42:40.150
<v Speaker 3>it just leads to a greater perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you live in a small town,</v>

2197
01:42:40.151 --> 01:42:42.100
<v Speaker 3>and I'm not knocking Ohio,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jamie,</v>

2198
01:42:42.430 --> 01:42:47.430
<v Speaker 3>but if you live in a small town in Ohio,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what you're used to and you kind </v>

2199
01:42:47.430 --> 01:42:51.281
<v Speaker 3>of like develop your pattern of what you</v>
<v Speaker 3>expect to see in the world based on </v>

2200
01:42:51.281 --> 01:42:51.970
<v Speaker 3>what's around you in a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a very close,</v>

2201
01:42:51.971 --> 01:42:54.850
<v Speaker 3>immediate area,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you're in the fucking rain forest</v>

2202
01:42:54.851 --> 01:42:59.851
<v Speaker 3>to Bolivia and you're hanging out with </v>
<v Speaker 3>these tribal folks who are going to go </v>

2203
01:42:59.851 --> 01:43:02.500
<v Speaker 3>hunt a monkey and you're with them on a </v>
<v Speaker 3>monkey hunt and they're all excited,</v>

2204
01:43:02.501 --> 01:43:07.501
<v Speaker 3>they shoot this monkey out of a tree </v>
<v Speaker 3>with a bow and Arrow they made </v>

2205
01:43:07.501 --> 01:43:09.691
<v Speaker 3>themselves and then they're cooking this</v>
<v Speaker 3>monkey over a fire and throwing wet </v>

2206
01:43:09.691 --> 01:43:09.691
<v Speaker 3>leaves on it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>smoking it,</v>

2207
01:43:09.691 --> 01:43:11.780
<v Speaker 3>and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck?</v>

2208
01:43:11.780 --> 01:43:14.320
<v Speaker 3>And these people do this every day and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going to die in this forest.</v>

2209
01:43:14.540 --> 01:43:15.400
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is what they.</v>

2210
01:43:15.450 --> 01:43:16.840
<v Speaker 3>This is what they do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is how they live.</v>

2211
01:43:16.960 --> 01:43:18.670
<v Speaker 3>And for you it's like I gotta get Outta </v>
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>

2212
01:43:18.850 --> 01:43:19.750
<v Speaker 3>For them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is like,</v>

2213
01:43:19.930 --> 01:43:24.370
<v Speaker 3>this is the small town in Ohio.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's just a small town in Ohio in the</v>

2214
01:43:24.371 --> 01:43:26.620
<v Speaker 3>jungle like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To them,</v>

2215
01:43:26.621 --> 01:43:30.250
<v Speaker 3>this is their world and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 3>interestingly for you,</v>

2216
01:43:30.251 --> 01:43:31.750
<v Speaker 3>it isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I gotta get Outta here.</v>

2217
01:43:31.810 --> 01:43:35.800
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it's like this is where I should,</v>
<v Speaker 3>should have been my whole life.</v>

2218
01:43:36.160 --> 01:43:41.160
<v Speaker 3>There are thousands of cases of people </v>
<v Speaker 3>from civilization running away to go </v>

2219
01:43:41.981 --> 01:43:46.981
<v Speaker 3>native.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are no historical cases that I </v>

2220
01:43:46.981 --> 01:43:48.760
<v Speaker 3>know of where native people have chosen </v>
<v Speaker 3>to come and live in civilization.</v>

2221
01:43:48.850 --> 01:43:53.850
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hate to beat a dead horse because I </v>

2222
01:43:53.850 --> 01:43:53.850
<v Speaker 3>always it with Sebastian Junger's</v>

<v Speaker 6>I really enjoyed that.</v>

2224
01:43:55.110 --> 01:43:57.110
<v Speaker 6>I talk about too much.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's one of those things.</v>

2225
01:43:57.160 --> 01:43:58.270
<v Speaker 6>It's good to me.</v>

2226
01:43:59.150 --> 01:44:00.920
<v Speaker 4>It's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is really good.</v>

2227
01:44:01.280 --> 01:44:04.250
<v Speaker 4>I've read it three times.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a short book.</v>

2228
01:44:04.350 --> 01:44:05.330
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's one of,</v>

2229
01:44:05.331 --> 01:44:10.331
<v Speaker 4>it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it covers a lot of the same ground that </v>

2230
01:44:10.331 --> 01:44:10.331
<v Speaker 4>I cover in civilized to death.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Actually.</v>

2231
01:44:10.331 --> 01:44:14.950
<v Speaker 4>I quote him in civilized to death and </v>
<v Speaker 4>some of them we have some of the same </v>

2232
01:44:14.950 --> 01:44:14.950
<v Speaker 4>sources,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but yeah,</v>

2233
01:44:14.950 --> 01:44:16.730
<v Speaker 4>he looked at some of the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that uh,</v>

2234
01:44:17.240 --> 01:44:22.240
<v Speaker 4>those accounts of people running away to</v>
<v Speaker 4>go live with the natives and it makes </v>

2235
01:44:22.240 --> 01:44:22.490
<v Speaker 4>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Totally makes sense.</v>

2236
01:44:22.491 --> 01:44:24.420
<v Speaker 4>Like a dog you ever read?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2237
01:44:25.040 --> 01:44:27.920
<v Speaker 4>call of the Wild Jack London.</v>
<v Speaker 4>London,</v>

2238
01:44:27.921 --> 01:44:29.890
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a school.</v>

2239
01:44:30.040 --> 01:44:35.040
<v Speaker 4>It's a very good book and it's about a </v>
<v Speaker 4>husky who goes and lives with the </v>

2240
01:44:35.040 --> 01:44:38.921
<v Speaker 4>wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's essentially the story of the </v>

2241
01:44:38.921 --> 01:44:41.591
<v Speaker 4>domesticated being going and living with</v>
<v Speaker 4>the wild iterations of that same being,</v>

2242
01:44:42.381 --> 01:44:47.381
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's like one of us and going to go </v>

2243
01:44:47.381 --> 01:44:49.580
<v Speaker 4>live in the Amazon or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a fantastic book if you like.</v>

2244
01:44:49.581 --> 01:44:52.400
<v Speaker 4>That kind of thing is at play in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>fields of the Lord.</v>

2245
01:44:52.490 --> 01:44:54.740
<v Speaker 4>I've heard that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I never read that one book,</v>

2246
01:44:54.760 --> 01:44:56.210
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Peter Matheson.</v>

2247
01:44:56.650 --> 01:44:57.940
<v Speaker 4>That's a book,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2248
01:44:58.140 --> 01:44:59.690
<v Speaker 4>Isn't there?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Probably 30 years old,</v>

2249
01:44:59.691 --> 01:45:04.691
<v Speaker 4>maybe more.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it was made into a film starring </v>

2250
01:45:04.691 --> 01:45:06.560
<v Speaker 4>down Daryl Hannah and Tom Waits.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

2251
01:45:06.800 --> 01:45:08.420
<v Speaker 4>who else?</v>
<v Speaker 4>John Lithgow,</v>

2252
01:45:08.421 --> 01:45:10.250
<v Speaker 4>Kathy Bates.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Incredible,</v>

2253
01:45:10.490 --> 01:45:11.600
<v Speaker 4>incredible cast.</v>

2254
01:45:12.940 --> 01:45:17.940
<v Speaker 6>There's something that you get from </v>
<v Speaker 6>escaping civilization that you,</v>

2255
01:45:20.360 --> 01:45:25.360
<v Speaker 6>if you don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're missing it until you're out </v>

2256
01:45:25.360 --> 01:45:25.360
<v Speaker 6>there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>When you're out there,</v>

2257
01:45:25.360 --> 01:45:26.590
<v Speaker 6>and I'm sure you experienced this in </v>
<v Speaker 6>your travels,</v>

2258
01:45:26.920 --> 01:45:31.920
<v Speaker 6>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's a certain detachment from the </v>

2259
01:45:31.920 --> 01:45:35.431
<v Speaker 6>masses,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like just just just to be out of the </v>

2260
01:45:35.431 --> 01:45:35.620
<v Speaker 6>hive and the influence of all the people</v>
<v Speaker 6>around you.</v>

2261
01:45:35.650 --> 01:45:40.650
<v Speaker 6>As weird as it seems,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's this energy that we're all </v>

2262
01:45:40.650 --> 01:45:44.371
<v Speaker 6>exchanging and these giant hives </v>
<v Speaker 6>together and some people live off of it </v>

2263
01:45:44.371 --> 01:45:47.791
<v Speaker 6>like those New York City people like my </v>

<v Speaker 4>shitting and puking into the same </v>

2289
01:46:46.921 --> 01:46:49.140
<v Speaker 4>plastic bag.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh boy.</v>

2290
01:46:49.200 --> 01:46:50.160
<v Speaker 4>Three days in the same</v>

2291
01:46:50.160 --> 01:46:52.290
<v Speaker 3>bag.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is it like after day three?</v>

2292
01:46:53.720 --> 01:46:57.370
<v Speaker 3>If you had the worst enemy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was day one.</v>

2293
01:46:57.470 --> 01:46:58.770
<v Speaker 3>Matthew.</v>
<v Speaker 3>On the third floor.</v>

2294
01:46:58.790 --> 01:47:02.130
<v Speaker 3>There's worst enemy was just standing </v>
<v Speaker 3>there smoking a cigarette.</v>

2295
01:47:02.131 --> 01:47:04.500
<v Speaker 3>Would you drop that bag on the mother?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mercy.</v>

2296
01:47:05.090 --> 01:47:07.320
<v Speaker 3>Mercy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have any enemies that.</v>

2297
01:47:07.930 --> 01:47:12.930
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd have to really hate somebody for </v>

2298
01:47:12.930 --> 01:47:12.930
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the funniest thing about that was</v>

2299
01:47:12.930 --> 01:47:15.120
<v Speaker 3>I came out of that room after I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It might've been two days.</v>

2300
01:47:15.121 --> 01:47:16.680
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it came out of that room,</v>

2301
01:47:17.430 --> 01:47:18.660
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pale,</v>

2302
01:47:18.661 --> 01:47:23.661
<v Speaker 3>emaciated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just totally drained and I went out on </v>

2303
01:47:23.661 --> 01:47:25.630
<v Speaker 3>the terrorists of this Pelinka ever been</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

2304
01:47:26.110 --> 01:47:27.000
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>amazing.</v>

2305
01:47:27.001 --> 01:47:31.890
<v Speaker 3>Mayan Ruins and lots of magic mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Once I hit one to teach an Eatsa,</v>

2306
01:47:32.330 --> 01:47:34.140
<v Speaker 3>a teaching school teaching,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he says,</v>

2307
01:47:34.141 --> 01:47:36.360
<v Speaker 3>much more sort of commercialized only </v>
<v Speaker 3>case.</v>

2308
01:47:36.361 --> 01:47:40.240
<v Speaker 3>Pretty wild stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Taloon was another one that's out on its</v>

2309
01:47:40.370 --> 01:47:42.220
<v Speaker 3>own or is that my hands mindset?</v>

2310
01:47:42.220 --> 01:47:43.530
<v Speaker 3>Both money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>

2311
01:47:43.531 --> 01:47:46.090
<v Speaker 3>I come out and there's this woman there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this German woman,</v>

2312
01:47:46.091 --> 01:47:49.140
<v Speaker 3>and we start chatting a little bit and </v>
<v Speaker 3>she,</v>

2313
01:47:49.520 --> 01:47:54.520
<v Speaker 3>and this was at a time in my life where </v>
<v Speaker 3>I was really nervous around women and </v>

2314
01:47:54.520 --> 01:47:58.970
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this woman was like super into me </v>

2315
01:47:58.970 --> 01:47:59.280
<v Speaker 3>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2316
01:47:59.281 --> 01:48:02.030
<v Speaker 3>I could not fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I just,</v>

2317
01:48:02.100 --> 01:48:03.300
<v Speaker 3>there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't do much.</v>

2318
01:48:03.330 --> 01:48:08.330
<v Speaker 3>I just saw it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>felt so sick and horrible and it turned </v>

2319
01:48:08.330 --> 01:48:08.430
<v Speaker 3>out later.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got to know her a little bit.</v>

2320
01:48:08.431 --> 01:48:11.730
<v Speaker 3>She was really into punk music and she </v>
<v Speaker 3>thought I looked like johnny rotten.</v>

2321
01:48:12.490 --> 01:48:14.800
<v Speaker 3>So she thought you were cute because you</v>
<v Speaker 3>looked at John Ross.</v>

2322
01:48:14.810 --> 01:48:18.120
<v Speaker 3>I looked like I was about to die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was the end of that.</v>

2323
01:48:18.121 --> 01:48:20.730
<v Speaker 3>Look for people out there that you might</v>
<v Speaker 3>go camping.</v>

2324
01:48:21.090 --> 01:48:24.060
<v Speaker 3>Please just get a gravity filter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't get Giardia.</v>

2325
01:48:24.090 --> 01:48:25.290
<v Speaker 3>You can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really easy.</v>

2326
01:48:25.380 --> 01:48:27.600
<v Speaker 3>It's real and there's also a thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>called a steri pen.</v>

2327
01:48:27.840 --> 01:48:28.890
<v Speaker 3>Steady parents.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wonderful.</v>

2328
01:48:29.340 --> 01:48:34.340
<v Speaker 3>Take the Steri pen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You run it around in the water for a </v>

2329
01:48:34.340 --> 01:48:36.210
<v Speaker 3>certain amount of time and it kills </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything bad in the water and you even</v>

2330
01:48:36.211 --> 01:48:40.040
<v Speaker 3>taste it doesn't taste any different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's literally like UV light.</v>

2331
01:48:40.830 --> 01:48:42.690
<v Speaker 3>There's a bunch of like stereo pens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a good one,</v>

2332
01:48:42.930 --> 01:48:45.600
<v Speaker 3>but these gravity filters are amazing </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they have pumps.</v>

2333
01:48:45.750 --> 01:48:48.060
<v Speaker 3>They have another one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can take some water and you pump it,</v>

2334
01:48:48.180 --> 01:48:53.180
<v Speaker 3>you pump it and it goes through the </v>
<v Speaker 3>filter into your water bottle and you </v>

2335
01:48:53.180 --> 01:48:55.020
<v Speaker 3>can drink it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can clean up all like 99 point nine,</v>

2336
01:48:55.021 --> 01:48:58.740
<v Speaker 3>nine percent of all the bullshit with </v>
<v Speaker 3>just a good filter and it doesn't.</v>

2337
01:48:58.770 --> 01:49:00.210
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to drop the chemicals in </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

2338
01:49:00.300 --> 01:49:02.580
<v Speaker 3>Some people bring those.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2339
01:49:02.581 --> 01:49:05.100
<v Speaker 3>I have a tablet and stuff like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you don't need to,</v>

2340
01:49:05.101 --> 01:49:07.060
<v Speaker 3>but please don't drink at a creek folks.</v>

2341
01:49:08.110 --> 01:49:11.490
<v Speaker 3>It could be dead yards up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you.</v>

2342
01:49:11.491 --> 01:49:16.491
<v Speaker 3>If you pull this up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just recently I read a thing online </v>

2343
01:49:16.491 --> 01:49:19.581
<v Speaker 3>saying that like it's almost never </v>
<v Speaker 3>necessary to filter your water when </v>

2344
01:49:19.581 --> 01:49:23.721
<v Speaker 3>you're in when you're camping,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I've always filtered my water </v>

2345
01:49:23.721 --> 01:49:25.230
<v Speaker 3>camping,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was this thing where they did all</v>

2346
01:49:25.231 --> 01:49:30.231
<v Speaker 3>these.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They took all these samples of creeks </v>

2347
01:49:30.231 --> 01:49:32.930
<v Speaker 3>from creeks and and like apparently </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're like self correcting mechanism </v>

2348
01:49:33.180 --> 01:49:38.180
<v Speaker 3>nature,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if something's dead hundred yards </v>

2349
01:49:38.180 --> 01:49:38.180
<v Speaker 3>up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're fucked.</v>

2350
01:49:38.180 --> 01:49:40.500
<v Speaker 3>If you don't want that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not worth it.</v>

2351
01:49:40.501 --> 01:49:43.020
<v Speaker 3>The gravity filter so fucking easy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like if you.</v>

2352
01:49:43.070 --> 01:49:48.070
<v Speaker 3>You could take the risk and shit your </v>
<v Speaker 3>brains out for three days or you can </v>

2353
01:49:48.070 --> 01:49:48.430
<v Speaker 3>just enjoy with water</v>

2354
01:49:48.430 --> 01:49:53.430
<v Speaker 2>from the same place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think shitting your brains out for </v>

2355
01:49:53.430 --> 01:49:53.430
<v Speaker 2>three days is a good experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2356
01:49:53.430 --> 01:49:54.190
<v Speaker 2>It's like an ordeal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Poison,</v>

2357
01:49:54.191 --> 01:49:54.750
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2358
01:49:57.160 --> 01:49:59.560
<v Speaker 2>Do you ever get high from vomiting?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2359
01:49:59.610 --> 01:50:00.610
<v Speaker 2>Have you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2360
01:50:00.700 --> 01:50:01.360
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2361
01:50:01.361 --> 01:50:03.220
<v Speaker 2>Because when you vomit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get all these endorphins.</v>

2362
01:50:03.490 --> 01:50:06.820
<v Speaker 2>You don't feel great after you vomit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt better.</v>

2363
01:50:07.040 --> 01:50:09.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go with gray.</v>

2364
01:50:10.360 --> 01:50:12.450
<v Speaker 2>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm relatively great.</v>

2365
01:50:12.520 --> 01:50:15.580
<v Speaker 2>Last time I did some serious vomiting </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I had food poisoning,</v>

2366
01:50:16.030 --> 01:50:19.870
<v Speaker 2>but I guess I was about 10 years ago I </v>
<v Speaker 2>had some pretty serious food poisoning.</v>

2367
01:50:19.900 --> 01:50:23.200
<v Speaker 2>It was just hurl anatomy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the last real,</v>

2368
01:50:23.320 --> 01:50:26.630
<v Speaker 2>real like unstoppable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2369
01:50:26.870 --> 01:50:30.020
<v Speaker 2>Well it's just coming out and just a fat</v>
<v Speaker 2>tube of it.</v>

2370
01:50:30.550 --> 01:50:32.700
<v Speaker 2>You ever have a colonic irrigation?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2371
01:50:33.080 --> 01:50:36.400
<v Speaker 2>not into things going in my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't believe.</v>

2372
01:50:36.401 --> 01:50:40.840
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe that that is necessarily</v>
<v Speaker 2>a healthy thing either.</v>

2373
01:50:41.620 --> 01:50:46.620
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe it's not that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this all the stuff that people </v>

2374
01:50:46.620 --> 01:50:46.900
<v Speaker 2>saying that it's healthy for you.</v>

2375
01:50:46.900 --> 01:50:51.900
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't necessarily think it is a while </v>

2376
01:50:51.900 --> 01:50:51.900
<v Speaker 2>about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2377
01:50:51.900 --> 01:50:53.410
<v Speaker 2>I sent you an email about him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually,</v>

2378
01:50:53.411 --> 01:50:54.570
<v Speaker 2>he's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

2379
01:50:54.580 --> 01:50:55.810
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am the big beard.</v>

2380
01:50:56.320 --> 01:50:57.340
<v Speaker 2>He's a fan of yours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2381
01:50:57.341 --> 01:50:57.830
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2382
01:50:57.831 --> 01:50:59.800
<v Speaker 2>I was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was with him in Tucson and he,</v>

2383
01:50:59.890 --> 01:51:02.200
<v Speaker 2>he saw,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's an old friend of Paul stamets.</v>

2384
01:51:02.560 --> 01:51:04.310
<v Speaker 2>He was at Harvard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2385
01:51:04.990 --> 01:51:05.860
<v Speaker 2>I can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll hook you up.</v>

2386
01:51:05.861 --> 01:51:09.430
<v Speaker 2>He is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He ever comes to La.</v>

2387
01:51:09.700 --> 01:51:11.920
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was the most famous doctor in America</v>

2388
01:51:11.921 --> 01:51:12.780
<v Speaker 2>for years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

2389
01:51:12.781 --> 01:51:13.510
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2390
01:51:13.900 --> 01:51:16.810
<v Speaker 2>but he's really interesting because he </v>
<v Speaker 2>was at Harvard with leary.</v>

2391
01:51:16.811 --> 01:51:21.040
<v Speaker 2>He studied under Richard Evans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shelties is undergrad degrees in botany.</v>

2392
01:51:21.430 --> 01:51:26.430
<v Speaker 2>Richard Evans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shelties as the guy who basically </v>

2393
01:51:26.430 --> 01:51:29.400
<v Speaker 2>discovered in Camas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hundreds of psychoactive plants in the </v>

2394
01:51:29.400 --> 01:51:30.580
<v Speaker 2>Amazon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2395
01:51:30.970 --> 01:51:32.920
<v Speaker 2>amazing dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

2396
01:51:33.100 --> 01:51:38.100
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so andrew was right in the mix and he </v>

2397
01:51:38.100 --> 01:51:41.131
<v Speaker 2>sort of was central in leary getting in </v>
<v Speaker 2>trouble because Andrew wrote an article </v>

2398
01:51:42.281 --> 01:51:47.281
<v Speaker 2>in the Harvard Crimson criticizing leary</v>
<v Speaker 2>for indiscriminately giving psilocybin </v>

2399
01:51:50.261 --> 01:51:51.070
<v Speaker 2>to students.</v>

2400
01:51:51.460 --> 01:51:54.550
<v Speaker 2>And that's what triggered the Tom after </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2401
01:51:54.910 --> 01:51:58.870
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Andrew went onto Harvard med school,</v>

2402
01:51:59.440 --> 01:52:02.110
<v Speaker 2>residency at mass,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this mass general in Boston,</v>

2403
01:52:02.111 --> 01:52:07.111
<v Speaker 2>like top top flight academic stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but instead of he got his md but then he</v>

2404
01:52:07.961 --> 01:52:11.740
<v Speaker 2>went and worked at the National </v>
<v Speaker 2>Institutes of health in Bethesda,</v>

2405
01:52:11.741 --> 01:52:14.590
<v Speaker 2>Maryland,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the main government research center.</v>

2406
01:52:15.030 --> 01:52:20.030
<v Speaker 2>So like early seventies I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he has never wavered in his </v>

2407
01:52:23.321 --> 01:52:27.160
<v Speaker 2>understanding that drugs are not </v>
<v Speaker 2>necessarily bad.</v>

2408
01:52:27.190 --> 01:52:31.030
<v Speaker 2>And so he did these double blind studies</v>
<v Speaker 2>about marijuana.</v>

2409
01:52:31.060 --> 01:52:36.060
<v Speaker 2>The first,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe double blind studies of </v>

2410
01:52:36.060 --> 01:52:36.850
<v Speaker 2>marijuana where he said like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2411
01:52:37.210 --> 01:52:42.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people have tested marijuana and they </v>

2412
01:52:42.210 --> 01:52:42.210
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2413
01:52:42.210 --> 01:52:45.121
<v Speaker 2>it's bad for your brain because what </v>
<v Speaker 2>they do is they get people high who've </v>

2414
01:52:45.121 --> 01:52:48.241
<v Speaker 2>never been high and then they give them </v>
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of math questions and they have </v>

2415
01:52:48.241 --> 01:52:48.800
<v Speaker 2>trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can answer them whenever he's like,</v>

2416
01:52:48.920 --> 01:52:51.470
<v Speaker 2>I've been high,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to do math when I'm high,</v>

2417
01:52:51.650 --> 01:52:54.440
<v Speaker 2>so let's test people on things they like</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing when they're high,</v>

2418
01:52:54.470 --> 01:52:59.470
<v Speaker 2>like color perception or pattern </v>
<v Speaker 2>recognition or ability to recognize </v>

2419
01:53:00.530 --> 01:53:03.050
<v Speaker 2>tonal changes in music,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things like that.</v>

2420
01:53:03.230 --> 01:53:05.900
<v Speaker 2>And he found that their perceptions were</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually heightened.</v>

2421
01:53:06.470 --> 01:53:07.280
<v Speaker 2>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

2422
01:53:07.281 --> 01:53:08.900
<v Speaker 2>see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>marijuana is not bad.</v>

2423
01:53:08.901 --> 01:53:11.750
<v Speaker 2>It's just bad for certain things and not</v>
<v Speaker 2>others.</v>

2424
01:53:11.990 --> 01:53:13.340
<v Speaker 2>So then he did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2425
01:53:14.070 --> 01:53:16.610
<v Speaker 2>I think it was about driving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We said,</v>

2426
01:53:16.611 --> 01:53:19.220
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they find that marijuana impacts impairs</v>

2427
01:53:19.221 --> 01:53:20.780
<v Speaker 2>driving ability,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's again,</v>

2428
01:53:20.781 --> 01:53:25.781
<v Speaker 2>because they're using naive people </v>
<v Speaker 2>who've never been high before and they </v>

2429
01:53:25.781 --> 01:53:27.680
<v Speaker 2>don't have a chance to practice driving </v>
<v Speaker 2>while high.</v>

2430
01:53:28.070 --> 01:53:32.150
<v Speaker 2>So he got people let them practice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let them get used to being high.</v>

2431
01:53:32.151 --> 01:53:37.151
<v Speaker 2>Then he tested their driving ability </v>
<v Speaker 2>versus what it had been before or when </v>

2432
01:53:37.151 --> 01:53:39.410
<v Speaker 2>they're not stone and average scores and</v>
<v Speaker 2>all that,</v>

2433
01:53:39.411 --> 01:53:44.411
<v Speaker 2>and he again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he found that when people had a chance </v>

2434
01:53:44.411 --> 01:53:44.411
<v Speaker 2>to practice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they drove fine.</v>

2435
01:53:44.411 --> 01:53:48.570
<v Speaker 2>There's no problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He got basically pushed out because he </v>

2436
01:53:48.570 --> 01:53:48.570
<v Speaker 2>was finding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2437
01:53:48.570 --> 01:53:51.740
<v Speaker 2>he was demonstrating that it's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>necessarily a bad thing.</v>

2438
01:53:51.890 --> 01:53:56.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's one of those things that we talked </v>

2439
01:53:56.890 --> 01:53:58.931
<v Speaker 2>about before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes people don't want to know the </v>

2440
01:53:58.931 --> 01:54:02.141
<v Speaker 2>actual results.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just want to know the results that </v>

2441
01:54:02.141 --> 01:54:04.781
<v Speaker 2>jive with their understanding of this is</v>
<v Speaker 2>really dangerous in science because </v>

2442
01:54:04.781 --> 01:54:08.960
<v Speaker 2>people are purporting to be objective </v>
<v Speaker 2>and sign off and they're not.</v>

2443
01:54:09.110 --> 01:54:14.110
<v Speaker 2>And it's not fair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not fair to all the people that </v>

2444
01:54:14.110 --> 01:54:16.901
<v Speaker 2>were unjustly arrested and prosecuted </v>
<v Speaker 2>and imprisoned for something that's very</v>

2445
01:54:17.571 --> 01:54:22.571
<v Speaker 2>beneficial.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they were saying a lot of them </v>

2446
01:54:22.571 --> 01:54:25.060
<v Speaker 2>saying that they like it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>saying that it does good things for </v>

2447
01:54:25.060 --> 01:54:25.060
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2448
01:54:25.060 --> 01:54:26.900
<v Speaker 2>it's not the end all cure all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's not a goddamn thing it is,</v>

2449
01:54:27.230 --> 01:54:28.950
<v Speaker 2>but it's certainly a tool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2450
01:54:28.990 --> 01:54:30.630
<v Speaker 2>And look at it objectively,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

2451
01:54:30.740 --> 01:54:34.030
<v Speaker 2>what's the ratio of benefit to danger?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2452
01:54:34.070 --> 01:54:35.960
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many people have died from marijuana</v>

2453
01:54:35.961 --> 01:54:37.820
<v Speaker 2>overdose?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Zero ever.</v>

2454
01:54:37.850 --> 01:54:42.850
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so Andy Wilde has been saying this </v>

2455
01:54:42.850 --> 01:54:44.600
<v Speaker 2>since the seventies and his first book </v>
<v Speaker 2>is called the natural mind that he wrote</v>

2456
01:54:44.601 --> 01:54:49.601
<v Speaker 2>the marriage of the sun and the moon </v>
<v Speaker 2>than a book called from chocolate to </v>

2457
01:54:49.601 --> 01:54:49.601
<v Speaker 2>morphine.</v>

2458
01:54:49.601 --> 01:54:52.520
<v Speaker 2>These are all big stretch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but chocolate is a drug,</v>

2459
01:54:52.521 --> 01:54:52.850
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2460
01:54:52.860 --> 01:54:53.420
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2461
01:54:53.690 --> 01:54:58.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the marriage of the sun and the </v>

2462
01:54:58.690 --> 01:55:00.131
<v Speaker 2>moon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Each chapter is about a mind altering </v>

2463
01:55:00.131 --> 01:55:00.770
<v Speaker 2>substance or experienced.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So vomiting is one chapter in there.</v>

2464
01:55:01.190 --> 01:55:02.780
<v Speaker 2>Cocaine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mushrooms.</v>

2465
01:55:03.020 --> 01:55:05.820
<v Speaker 2>So he and Paul stamets had been buddies </v>
<v Speaker 2>for 35 years.</v>

2466
01:55:05.821 --> 01:55:10.821
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does that have anything to do with </v>

2467
01:55:10.821 --> 01:55:12.011
<v Speaker 2>bulemia?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does bulemia also like something where </v>

2468
01:55:12.011 --> 01:55:12.011
<v Speaker 2>people are getting addicted to actual </v>
<v Speaker 2>throwing up?</v>

2469
01:55:12.170 --> 01:55:17.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there are religions where people </v>

2470
01:55:17.170 --> 01:55:17.630
<v Speaker 2>vomit every morning in India.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think Gandhi vomited every morning.</v>

2471
01:55:17.780 --> 01:55:20.440
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Gandhi and he drank his own pissed</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way.</v>

2472
01:55:20.630 --> 01:55:21.690
<v Speaker 2>Way to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2473
01:55:22.130 --> 01:55:27.130
<v Speaker 2>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Andy Weil is this kind of hippie doctor </v>

2474
01:55:27.130 --> 01:55:30.230
<v Speaker 2>dude with all the drugs and all that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the big white beard.</v>

2475
01:55:30.560 --> 01:55:32.120
<v Speaker 2>And then he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2476
01:55:32.930 --> 01:55:37.930
<v Speaker 2>he became very famous in the eighties </v>
<v Speaker 2>with books about alternative medicine,</v>

2477
01:55:39.110 --> 01:55:44.110
<v Speaker 2>but he goes complimentary medicine </v>
<v Speaker 2>because he's not saying Western </v>

2478
01:55:44.110 --> 01:55:44.130
<v Speaker 2>medicine's bad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's</v>

2479
01:55:44.130 --> 01:55:47.910
<v Speaker 3>saying it's good for some things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not the best approach to other things.</v>

2480
01:55:48.020 --> 01:55:52.710
<v Speaker 3>So he brings in Ayervetic and Chinese </v>
<v Speaker 3>and all these different traditions,</v>

2481
01:55:52.711 --> 01:55:56.310
<v Speaker 3>depending on what the issue is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He became very mainstream,</v>

2482
01:55:56.311 --> 01:56:00.960
<v Speaker 3>huge mega bestsellers on Oprah cover of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Time magazine,</v>

2483
01:56:01.050 --> 01:56:05.340
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he started a school at the University of</v>

2484
01:56:05.340 --> 01:56:09.600
<v Speaker 3>Arizona for doctors to get a </v>
<v Speaker 3>certification in complimentary medicine.</v>

2485
01:56:09.601 --> 01:56:12.120
<v Speaker 3>So He's super mainstream,</v>
<v Speaker 3>successful,</v>

2486
01:56:12.390 --> 01:56:17.390
<v Speaker 3>but he has never wavered on his stance </v>
<v Speaker 3>on drugs.</v>

2487
01:56:18.930 --> 01:56:22.420
<v Speaker 3>And so imagine the pressures that were </v>
<v Speaker 3>coming on them believable.</v>

2488
01:56:22.440 --> 01:56:23.120
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2489
01:56:23.121 --> 01:56:25.500
<v Speaker 3>fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The seventies and the eighties.</v>

2490
01:56:25.830 --> 01:56:30.830
<v Speaker 3>All that say no to drugs era.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's a question that you'd probably </v>

2491
01:56:30.830 --> 01:56:30.920
<v Speaker 3>know the answer to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2492
01:56:31.200 --> 01:56:36.200
<v Speaker 3>there are obviously killing untold </v>
<v Speaker 3>numbers of rhinos for their horns </v>

2493
01:56:36.511 --> 01:56:39.720
<v Speaker 3>because men want to grind them up and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's supposed to get your dick hard.</v>

2494
01:56:40.200 --> 01:56:45.200
<v Speaker 3>Does that work for me?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you try it and have it out there </v>

2495
01:56:46.051 --> 01:56:48.100
<v Speaker 3>killing rhinos on the snake pit forever?</v>

2496
01:56:48.440 --> 01:56:50.970
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is there any science to that?</v>

2497
01:56:51.780 --> 01:56:53.460
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not that I'm aware of.</v>

2498
01:56:53.461 --> 01:56:57.210
<v Speaker 3>That is the craziest genocide ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And who's doing it?</v>

2499
01:56:57.211 --> 01:57:00.330
<v Speaker 3>It's not Africans who think it's gonna </v>
<v Speaker 3>make their dicks hard.</v>

2500
01:57:00.360 --> 01:57:05.360
<v Speaker 3>It's Chinese.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's Asian people that apparently have </v>

2501
01:57:05.360 --> 01:57:09.750
<v Speaker 3>a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I was told is that it's not even </v>

2502
01:57:09.750 --> 01:57:12.210
<v Speaker 3>necessarily just about the idea that it </v>
<v Speaker 3>gets your dick hard,</v>

2503
01:57:12.270 --> 01:57:17.270
<v Speaker 3>but there is value in the fact that it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>a forbidden thing that's very difficult </v>

2504
01:57:17.270 --> 01:57:17.610
<v Speaker 3>to acquire.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's.</v>

2505
01:57:17.611 --> 01:57:21.420
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a signaling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a Rolex watch or a Lamborghini</v>

2506
01:57:21.421 --> 01:57:26.421
<v Speaker 3>or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like what my friend told me it was </v>

2507
01:57:26.421 --> 01:57:26.421
<v Speaker 3>that it's not just a signaling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's a signaling that you don't give</v>

2508
01:57:26.421 --> 01:57:27.350
<v Speaker 3>a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you're,</v>

2509
01:57:27.360 --> 01:57:31.590
<v Speaker 3>you're here to make money and get the </v>
<v Speaker 3>best and have the best things.</v>

2510
01:57:31.591 --> 01:57:33.780
<v Speaker 3>And look what's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's drink rhino t and then we're gonna</v>

2511
01:57:33.790 --> 01:57:34.920
<v Speaker 3>eat shark fin soup.</v>

2512
01:57:35.100 --> 01:57:37.860
<v Speaker 3>Ha can live.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Monkey brain.</v>

2513
01:57:38.290 --> 01:57:39.720
<v Speaker 3>Have you seen that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen that.</v>

2514
01:57:40.170 --> 01:57:42.210
<v Speaker 3>That's really intense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's real.</v>

2515
01:57:42.330 --> 01:57:45.510
<v Speaker 3>I've sought in um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a faces of death.</v>

2516
01:57:46.080 --> 01:57:51.080
<v Speaker 3>A bunch of people sitting around there </v>
<v Speaker 3>whacking a monkey in the head with a </v>

2517
01:57:51.080 --> 01:57:51.080
<v Speaker 3>hammer and his head stuck in this little</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>

2518
01:57:51.080 --> 01:57:51.210
<v Speaker 3>but I was in the table.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2519
01:57:51.211 --> 01:57:54.120
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't really sure if that was real </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they scoop it out.</v>

2520
01:57:54.121 --> 01:57:55.170
<v Speaker 3>And you didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2521
01:57:55.230 --> 01:57:58.950
<v Speaker 3>Rattlesnake brains though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't that like prions?</v>

2522
01:57:58.951 --> 01:58:02.490
<v Speaker 3>Can you get prions from primate brains?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you can.</v>

2523
01:58:02.580 --> 01:58:05.240
<v Speaker 3>You could be deathly ill from that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2524
01:58:05.840 --> 01:58:08.430
<v Speaker 3>Like that's essentially what mad cow </v>
<v Speaker 3>diseases.</v>

2525
01:58:08.450 --> 01:58:09.560
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2526
01:58:10.470 --> 01:58:11.980
<v Speaker 3>From brains.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Chow,</v>

2527
01:58:12.100 --> 01:58:13.560
<v Speaker 3>forcing cows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eat cows.</v>

2528
01:58:13.561 --> 01:58:18.561
<v Speaker 3>That's where mad cow disease comes from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a body mind couldn't give blood</v>

2529
01:58:19.140 --> 01:58:21.390
<v Speaker 3>because he was in England.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He lived in England during the time that</v>

2530
01:58:21.391 --> 01:58:23.250
<v Speaker 3>the mad cow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was in Spain then.</v>

2531
01:58:23.620 --> 01:58:28.620
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't give blood because of the </v>

2532
01:58:28.620 --> 01:58:28.620
<v Speaker 3>hepatitis A.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which one did you get?</v>

2533
01:58:28.620 --> 01:58:28.620
<v Speaker 3>A,</v>
<v Speaker 3>B or c?</v>

2534
01:58:29.130 --> 01:58:30.240
<v Speaker 3>A.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that a good one?</v>

2535
01:58:30.300 --> 01:58:30.930
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the,</v>

2536
01:58:30.960 --> 01:58:34.020
<v Speaker 3>that's the one is easy one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

2537
01:58:34.080 --> 01:58:39.080
<v Speaker 3>It was like a month down yellow eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like no energy a month.</v>

2538
01:58:41.290 --> 01:58:41.800
<v Speaker 3>That was,</v>

2539
01:58:42.160 --> 01:58:42.910
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That,</v>

2540
01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:44.050
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a long story,</v>

2541
01:58:44.051 --> 01:58:49.051
<v Speaker 2>but that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I actually got it from a guy who </v>

2542
01:58:49.051 --> 01:58:51.050
<v Speaker 2>was sort of saving me from something </v>
<v Speaker 2>else that I,</v>

2543
01:58:51.390 --> 01:58:54.190
<v Speaker 2>they never told you the whole Scorpion </v>
<v Speaker 2>and Guatemala story.</v>

2544
01:58:54.610 --> 01:58:55.780
<v Speaker 2>I think he did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But tell me again.</v>

2545
01:58:55.781 --> 01:58:56.920
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a long story.</v>

2546
01:58:57.660 --> 01:58:58.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2547
01:58:59.290 --> 01:59:04.290
<v Speaker 2>I don't know though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People will be well feel like they're </v>

2548
01:59:04.290 --> 01:59:04.290
<v Speaker 2>getting now people can hear it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2549
01:59:04.290 --> 01:59:05.170
<v Speaker 2>I've told her it on my podcast and I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>also,</v>

2550
01:59:05.171 --> 01:59:09.130
<v Speaker 2>I told her it on a podcast called risk </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's actually cliff notes.</v>

2551
01:59:09.420 --> 01:59:10.960
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2552
01:59:10.961 --> 01:59:15.961
<v Speaker 2>but listen to the risk thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if anyone wants to hear the whole thing </v>

2553
01:59:15.961 --> 01:59:15.961
<v Speaker 2>because they added sound effects and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really good.</v>

2554
01:59:15.961 --> 01:59:17.000
<v Speaker 2>What is risk?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>

2555
01:59:17.001 --> 01:59:20.800
<v Speaker 2>it's a podcast or just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a storytelling thing,</v>

2556
01:59:20.820 --> 01:59:22.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like the moth,</v>

2557
01:59:22.121 --> 01:59:24.880
<v Speaker 2>it's that kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they added sound effects.</v>

2558
01:59:24.930 --> 01:59:26.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They produced it really well.</v>

2559
01:59:26.531 --> 01:59:27.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As well to.</v>

2560
01:59:28.270 --> 01:59:29.530

<v Speaker 2>What happened was I was,</v>

2561
01:59:29.590 --> 01:59:32.020
<v Speaker 2>I was with my girlfriend at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Puerto Rican,</v>

2562
01:59:32.110 --> 01:59:35.710
<v Speaker 2>super beautiful Puerto Rican girl,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and she tried to get you to go to a camp</v>

2563
01:59:35.711 --> 01:59:40.711
<v Speaker 2>away and talk about Jesus or no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she never tried to talk to me about </v>

2564
01:59:40.711 --> 01:59:44.041
<v Speaker 2>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I would have listened because she </v>

2565
01:59:44.041 --> 01:59:44.041
<v Speaker 2>was interested in how the APP.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2566
01:59:44.041 --> 01:59:44.500
<v Speaker 2>she was great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2567
01:59:45.310 --> 01:59:50.310
<v Speaker 2>so I was with her in Guatemala and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had met this other couple,</v>

2568
01:59:52.360 --> 01:59:57.360
<v Speaker 2>solange and Fabrizio and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2569
01:59:59.021 --> 02:00:03.480
<v Speaker 2>we were at this place called t carl in </v>
<v Speaker 2>North East Guatemala,</v>

2570
02:00:03.481 --> 02:00:08.481
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>way back in the jungle and it's a mayan </v>

2571
02:00:08.481 --> 02:00:08.481
<v Speaker 2>ruins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>beautiful,</v>

2572
02:00:08.800 --> 02:00:09.730
<v Speaker 2>crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2573
02:00:09.731 --> 02:00:12.140
<v Speaker 2>it was like a big city and now they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2574
02:00:12.730 --> 02:00:14.410
<v Speaker 2>when I was there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was 1989,</v>

2575
02:00:14.411 --> 02:00:18.700
<v Speaker 2>there were maybe 10 big ruins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>big temples that they had uncovered.</v>

2576
02:00:19.270 --> 02:00:22.240
<v Speaker 2>And we're staying in this campsite with </v>
<v Speaker 2>hammocks.</v>

2577
02:00:22.241 --> 02:00:24.850
<v Speaker 2>It was very primitive at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

2578
02:00:24.940 --> 02:00:26.410
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

2579
02:00:26.411 --> 02:00:30.460
<v Speaker 2>it was a full moon and on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I decided we were going to take some</v>

2580
02:00:30.461 --> 02:00:35.461
<v Speaker 2>acid and watch the moon rise and the sun</v>
<v Speaker 2>set up from the top of symbol for,</v>

2581
02:00:37.480 --> 02:00:41.980
<v Speaker 2>it's called the Jaguar temple.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we went up with this other couple</v>

2582
02:00:42.310 --> 02:00:45.430
<v Speaker 2>and there's this ledge up there and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>up above tree line,</v>

2583
02:00:45.431 --> 02:00:46.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're way above the tree line.</v>

2584
02:00:46.691 --> 02:00:48.820
<v Speaker 2>You can see the monkeys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the monkeys and,</v>

2585
02:00:49.420 --> 02:00:53.090
<v Speaker 2>and like see out over this flat jungle </v>
<v Speaker 2>Putin,</v>

2586
02:00:53.110 --> 02:00:55.260
<v Speaker 2>I think it's called.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

2587
02:00:55.330 --> 02:01:00.330
<v Speaker 2>so we're up there and the sun's sinking </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the moon is rising and the moon </v>

2588
02:01:01.511 --> 02:01:03.160
<v Speaker 2>comes up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's beautiful.</v>

2589
02:01:03.161 --> 02:01:08.161
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's this big bank of storm </v>

2590
02:01:08.161 --> 02:01:11.020
<v Speaker 2>clouds and the full moon is like between</v>
<v Speaker 2>the horizon and the storm clouds.</v>

2591
02:01:11.020 --> 02:01:14.620
<v Speaker 2>But then it starts to go up behind these</v>
<v Speaker 2>clouds and you can see it's going to get</v>

2592
02:01:14.650 --> 02:01:15.910
<v Speaker 2>dark as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2593
02:01:15.911 --> 02:01:17.380
<v Speaker 2>So this other couple were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2594
02:01:17.381 --> 02:01:20.140
<v Speaker 2>we're going to go back to the campsite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't know we were tripping.</v>

2595
02:01:20.200 --> 02:01:21.580
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we timed it.</v>

2596
02:01:21.581 --> 02:01:26.581
<v Speaker 2>So we were peeking like now you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so they're going to go back to the </v>

2597
02:01:26.711 --> 02:01:28.430
<v Speaker 2>campsite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we,</v>

2598
02:01:28.440 --> 02:01:29.380
<v Speaker 2>but we were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2599
02:01:29.381 --> 02:01:30.940
<v Speaker 2>we're gonna just hang here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2600
02:01:30.941 --> 02:01:35.941
<v Speaker 2>So I went over to hold the flashlight </v>
<v Speaker 2>for them as they went down this ladder </v>

2601
02:01:35.941 --> 02:01:39.770
<v Speaker 2>and was like maybe a 30 foot ladder pipe</v>
<v Speaker 2>ladder drilled into the temples,</v>

2602
02:01:39.771 --> 02:01:40.070
<v Speaker 2>made out</v>

2603
02:01:40.070 --> 02:01:42.830
<v Speaker 4>of limestone blocks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so to get up there.</v>

2604
02:01:42.860 --> 02:01:43.520
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there you go.</v>

2605
02:01:43.880 --> 02:01:46.310
<v Speaker 4>Before.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we're at steep.</v>

2606
02:01:47.580 --> 02:01:50.450
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that climbed up at temple for though?</v>

2607
02:01:51.190 --> 02:01:52.190
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2608
02:01:52.320 --> 02:01:54.640
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Jaguar temple.</v>

2609
02:01:55.210 --> 02:01:56.640
<v Speaker 4>I typed in temple for Jaguar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

2612
02:01:58.851 --> 02:02:01.100

<v Speaker 4>overgrown.</v>

2613
02:02:02.090 --> 02:02:03.560
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anyway,</v>

2614
02:02:03.561 --> 02:02:05.580
<v Speaker 4>so we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we went up to the top of that.</v>

2615
02:02:05.610 --> 02:02:07.640
<v Speaker 4>Looks like if they're on the right.</v>

<v Speaker 4>were there anyway.</v>

2617
02:02:10.461 --> 02:02:15.461

<v Speaker 4>and see how flat the jungle is.</v>

<v Speaker 4>step and fuck.</v>

2631
02:02:46.910 --> 02:02:48.140
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck was that?</v>

2632
02:02:48.440 --> 02:02:51.440
<v Speaker 4>I turned the flashlight back on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See the Scorpion going up the wall,</v>

2633
02:02:51.441 --> 02:02:55.610
<v Speaker 4>stirring up the wall like four inches </v>
<v Speaker 4>green,</v>

2634
02:02:55.940 --> 02:02:58.490
<v Speaker 4>and then they're like three other ones </v>
<v Speaker 4>on the wall and say,</v>

2635
02:02:58.510 --> 02:03:01.460
<v Speaker 4>fuck this things crawling with fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>scorpions.</v>

2636
02:03:01.820 --> 02:03:06.820
<v Speaker 4>And I just got stung on the toe while </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're on acid while I'm tripit and </v>

2637
02:03:06.820 --> 02:03:09.580
<v Speaker 4>thank God I didn't jump because I would </v>
<v Speaker 4>have dropped 30 feet to fucking rocks.</v>

2638
02:03:09.630 --> 02:03:14.630
<v Speaker 4>Oh my gosh.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I go back to Anna and she said,</v>

2639
02:03:16.100 --> 02:03:16.940
<v Speaker 4>what happened to you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>

2640
02:03:16.941 --> 02:03:18.470
<v Speaker 4>I just fucking Scorpion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

2641
02:03:18.471 --> 02:03:19.330
<v Speaker 4>watch out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And like,</v>

2642
02:03:19.340 --> 02:03:20.120
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jesus,</v>

2643
02:03:20.121 --> 02:03:21.200
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>

2644
02:03:21.650 --> 02:03:22.880
<v Speaker 4>So we're kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2645
02:03:22.881 --> 02:03:24.170
<v Speaker 4>are they dangerous?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

2646
02:03:24.180 --> 02:03:25.960
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

2647
02:03:26.540 --> 02:03:29.600
<v Speaker 4>So I'm now it's getting dark,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2648
02:03:29.600 --> 02:03:34.280
<v Speaker 4>Because the moon's going behind these </v>
<v Speaker 4>clouds and there's this other,</v>

2649
02:03:34.281 --> 02:03:39.281
<v Speaker 4>these two dudes like way over on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>other side of the ledge and we go over </v>

2650
02:03:39.281 --> 02:03:42.680
<v Speaker 4>to them and they're Italian and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't speak English,</v>

2651
02:03:42.681 --> 02:03:47.681
<v Speaker 4>but he spoke Spanish,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so she was talking to them in Spanish </v>

2652
02:03:47.681 --> 02:03:49.100
<v Speaker 4>and Italian and you sort of understand,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2653
02:03:49.460 --> 02:03:54.460
<v Speaker 4>they're both Latin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>similar languages and those guys are </v>

2654
02:03:54.460 --> 02:03:54.460
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ah,</v>

2655
02:03:54.460 --> 02:03:54.460
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we were like,</v>

2656
02:03:54.460 --> 02:03:55.550
<v Speaker 4>watch out because they're all around </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2657
02:03:55.551 --> 02:03:56.240
<v Speaker 4>oh shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2658
02:03:56.690 --> 02:03:59.870
<v Speaker 4>So while we're talking to them now it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>totally dark.</v>

2659
02:03:59.900 --> 02:04:04.900
<v Speaker 4>This Guatemalan dude comes up the ladder</v>
<v Speaker 4>with an old bolt action rifle and he's </v>

2660
02:04:05.031 --> 02:04:10.031
<v Speaker 4>like the night guard or something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we go over to him and honest as to </v>

2661
02:04:10.031 --> 02:04:14.291
<v Speaker 4>him in Spanish is in some Scorpio and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they got,</v>

2662
02:04:15.890 --> 02:04:18.900
<v Speaker 4>are they dangerous?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Scorpions and the guy says csun like</v>

2663
02:04:18.960 --> 02:04:20.470
<v Speaker 4>Dolly's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm worth those.</v>

2664
02:04:21.150 --> 02:04:22.700
<v Speaker 4>They're lethal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There are deaths.</v>

2665
02:04:24.040 --> 02:04:24.600
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ah,</v>

2666
02:04:24.740 --> 02:04:27.470
<v Speaker 4>fuck man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I understood enough Spanish to get that.</v>

2667
02:04:27.471 --> 02:04:29.240
<v Speaker 4>You're thinking you're dying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I'm like,</v>

2668
02:04:30.340 --> 02:04:31.280
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it?</v>

2669
02:04:32.540 --> 02:04:35.180
<v Speaker 4>April,</v>
<v Speaker 4>full moon of April 1989.</v>

2670
02:04:35.470 --> 02:04:36.510
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was 27.</v>

2671
02:04:36.511 --> 02:04:38.100
<v Speaker 4>It was right around time of trump's </v>
<v Speaker 4>plane</v>

2672
02:04:38.100 --> 02:04:40.650
<v Speaker 2>crashed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if it was exactly the same?</v>

2673
02:04:40.720 --> 02:04:44.460
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Talk about being curious in your life.</v>

2674
02:04:44.830 --> 02:04:45.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2675
02:04:45.690 --> 02:04:50.690
<v Speaker 2>I was at a table that Puerto Rican girl </v>
<v Speaker 2>while you were would that other Puerto </v>

2676
02:04:50.690 --> 02:04:52.090
<v Speaker 2>Rican girl up there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Puerto Rican girls crossed our paths.</v>

2677
02:04:53.030 --> 02:04:55.050
<v Speaker 2>Both survived.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was barely.</v>

2678
02:04:55.051 --> 02:04:59.400
<v Speaker 2>So what happened to you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm thinking like,</v>

2679
02:05:00.300 --> 02:05:05.300
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I gotta get down from here because </v>

2680
02:05:05.300 --> 02:05:07.521
<v Speaker 2>there's no way anyone else could carry </v>
<v Speaker 2>me down these ladders and you couldn't </v>

2681
02:05:07.521 --> 02:05:07.560
<v Speaker 2>get a stretcher down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2682
02:05:07.590 --> 02:05:12.000
<v Speaker 2>So if I'm going to survive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to get down on my own quickly.</v>

2683
02:05:12.001 --> 02:05:14.670
<v Speaker 2>So then if I collapse they can get an </v>
<v Speaker 2>ambulance.</v>

2684
02:05:14.970 --> 02:05:16.620
<v Speaker 2>Although we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2685
02:05:16.680 --> 02:05:20.280
<v Speaker 2>two days from Guatemala City and </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever the town was,</v>

2686
02:05:20.281 --> 02:05:22.680
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know if they had a clinic </v>
<v Speaker 2>or I don't know,</v>

2687
02:05:22.681 --> 02:05:27.681
<v Speaker 2>but we were pretty remote and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not going to send out a </v>

2688
02:05:27.681 --> 02:05:28.740
<v Speaker 2>helicopter or some shit like that.</v>

2689
02:05:28.740 --> 02:05:30.150
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2690
02:05:30.151 --> 02:05:32.280
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get down.</v>

2691
02:05:32.610 --> 02:05:33.030
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2692
02:05:33.031 --> 02:05:35.250
<v Speaker 2>so what happens is my girlfriend's </v>
<v Speaker 2>freaking out.</v>

2693
02:05:36.670 --> 02:05:39.000
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no criticism of her.</v>

2694
02:05:39.001 --> 02:05:44.001
<v Speaker 2>I think it's much harder to watch </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone you love die than to die </v>

2695
02:05:44.001 --> 02:05:45.930
<v Speaker 2>yourself and in this case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so she's like,</v>

2696
02:05:45.931 --> 02:05:47.190
<v Speaker 2>Oh fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're dying.</v>

2697
02:05:47.191 --> 02:05:48.340
<v Speaker 2>And I'm thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gee,</v>

2698
02:05:48.341 --> 02:05:49.170
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe.</v>

2699
02:05:49.171 --> 02:05:52.500
<v Speaker 2>And so the one of the Italian dudes was </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2700
02:05:52.620 --> 02:05:53.610
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you guys go,</v>

2701
02:05:53.611 --> 02:05:56.730
<v Speaker 2>I'll stay with her and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make sure she's all right.</v>

2702
02:05:56.731 --> 02:05:58.950
<v Speaker 2>And so I go down with his other Italian </v>
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

2703
02:05:58.951 --> 02:06:03.951
<v Speaker 2>We go down the ladder and we get down to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the floor and we start walking around </v>

2704
02:06:03.951 --> 02:06:07.980
<v Speaker 2>the jungle and it's fucking totally dark</v>
<v Speaker 2>now because the moon's totally obscured.</v>

2705
02:06:08.560 --> 02:06:09.780
<v Speaker 2>And the jungle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2706
02:06:09.781 --> 02:06:10.620
<v Speaker 2>when you're tripping,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

2707
02:06:10.650 --> 02:06:15.650
<v Speaker 2>your pupils are super dilated so you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>see light and stuff that normally you </v>

2708
02:06:15.650 --> 02:06:17.940
<v Speaker 2>might miss.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the jungle in Guatemala was full of</v>

2709
02:06:17.941 --> 02:06:21.950
<v Speaker 2>glowing worms and shit flying by.</v>

2710
02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:24.390
<v Speaker 2>It's all like green and blue and.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2711
02:06:24.391 --> 02:06:29.391
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're like these caterpillars and </v>

2712
02:06:29.391 --> 02:06:29.391
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit,</v>

2713
02:06:29.391 --> 02:06:30.120
<v Speaker 2>this place is wild.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're walking around,</v>

2714
02:06:30.360 --> 02:06:32.820
<v Speaker 2>lost.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Totally dark tripping.</v>

2715
02:06:33.270 --> 02:06:34.920
<v Speaker 2>I'm tripping.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't know.</v>

2716
02:06:34.921 --> 02:06:36.280
<v Speaker 2>I'm tripping.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How,</v>

2717
02:06:36.360 --> 02:06:41.340
<v Speaker 2>how trip and are you tripping?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was three head nods,</v>

2718
02:06:41.341 --> 02:06:43.950
<v Speaker 2>ladies and gentlemen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2719
02:06:44.320 --> 02:06:49.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm peeking from the acid plus all the </v>

2720
02:06:49.320 --> 02:06:49.320
<v Speaker 2>adrenaline,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2721
02:06:49.320 --> 02:06:53.880
<v Speaker 2>And so this pain is running up my leg </v>
<v Speaker 2>and as it's like running up my,</v>

2722
02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:57.420
<v Speaker 2>the bone in the center of the leg,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just kind of fire.</v>

2723
02:06:57.720 --> 02:07:01.160
<v Speaker 2>And when it gets to the top of muscles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seize up,</v>

2724
02:07:01.820 --> 02:07:03.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my from the knee down,</v>

2725
02:07:03.931 --> 02:07:08.931
<v Speaker 2>it's just like rigid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then my tongue starts swelling and </v>

2726
02:07:08.971 --> 02:07:13.971
<v Speaker 2>my throat starts swelling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I got this like novacane feeling in </v>

2727
02:07:13.971 --> 02:07:17.481
<v Speaker 2>my lips and I'm sort of drooling and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm thinking when this gets to my </v>

2728
02:07:19.141 --> 02:07:20.970
<v Speaker 2>heart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's when I die.</v>

2729
02:07:21.750 --> 02:07:25.380
<v Speaker 2>And so I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm with this guy and we're lost.</v>

2730
02:07:25.381 --> 02:07:28.890
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and at first like I'm freaked,</v>

2731
02:07:28.891 --> 02:07:33.891
<v Speaker 2>I'm scared and then it occurs to me that</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying my last words to a guy whose </v>

2732
02:07:39.341 --> 02:07:44.341
<v Speaker 2>face I've never seen because we didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>shine the light in his face when we're </v>

2733
02:07:44.341 --> 02:07:47.950
<v Speaker 2>talking to him and he doesn't understand</v>
<v Speaker 2>English.</v>

2734
02:07:48.730 --> 02:07:53.730
<v Speaker 2>And that cracks me up that I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I start laughing like a fucking maniac </v>

2735
02:07:54.310 --> 02:07:55.960
<v Speaker 2>and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>got his arm around me.</v>

2736
02:07:55.961 --> 02:07:58.210
<v Speaker 2>He thinks I'm like losing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm just like,</v>

2737
02:07:58.211 --> 02:08:03.211
<v Speaker 2>this is hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think about my friends and how </v>

2738
02:08:03.211 --> 02:08:04.510
<v Speaker 2>they're going to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2739
02:08:04.710 --> 02:08:06.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good on Chris,</v>

2740
02:08:06.130 --> 02:08:06.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

2741
02:08:06.770 --> 02:08:10.370
<v Speaker 2>he didn't die in some dumb ass way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we all thought he would get.</v>

2742
02:08:10.630 --> 02:08:12.700
<v Speaker 2>He died in this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's still a dumb ass way,</v>

2743
02:08:12.701 --> 02:08:15.250
<v Speaker 2>but at least it's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I started thinking,</v>

2744

<v Speaker 2>but I've been around the world.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I've been in love.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I made a shit ton of money.</v>

2751
02:08:33.850 --> 02:08:36.190
<v Speaker 2>I walked away from it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2752
02:08:36.340 --> 02:08:40.120
<v Speaker 2>I've done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've done everything I wanted to do.</v>

2753
02:08:40.870 --> 02:08:45.870
<v Speaker 2>I'm 27,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've done everything and I've had a </v>

2754
02:08:45.870 --> 02:08:47.140
<v Speaker 2>fucking amazing life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2755
02:08:47.710 --> 02:08:50.560
<v Speaker 2>And this is cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would have been crying like a bitch,</v>

2756
02:08:51.400 --> 02:08:52.170
<v Speaker 2>I believe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2757
02:08:53.390 --> 02:08:56.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt really bad for my parents and,</v>

2758
02:08:56.640 --> 02:08:58.900
<v Speaker 2>and Ana.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But for myself,</v>

2759
02:08:58.901 --> 02:09:01.930
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had a good fucking run.</v>

2760
02:09:02.350 --> 02:09:05.650
<v Speaker 2>It's not as long as I would've liked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've had a good fucking run.</v>

2761
02:09:06.100 --> 02:09:11.100
<v Speaker 2>So I really came to this piece and like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world doesn't owe me shit,</v>

2762
02:09:14.711 --> 02:09:15.910
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had.</v>

2763
02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:18.610
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had been in Alaska two summers at that</v>

2764
02:09:18.611 --> 02:09:23.611
<v Speaker 2>point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I worked in New York in Manhattan for </v>

2765
02:09:23.611 --> 02:09:26.311
<v Speaker 2>two years at that point with a guy who </v>
<v Speaker 2>offered me a million dollars if I would </v>

2766
02:09:26.311 --> 02:09:26.311
<v Speaker 2>stay.</v>

2767
02:09:26.311 --> 02:09:27.400
<v Speaker 2>And I said No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I left.</v>

2768
02:09:27.810 --> 02:09:30.850
<v Speaker 2>I flew to India.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had been in Asia for two years.</v>

2769
02:09:30.940 --> 02:09:34.270
<v Speaker 2>You've said no to a million bucks when I</v>
<v Speaker 2>was 26.</v>

2770
02:09:34.330 --> 02:09:39.330
<v Speaker 2>Why did you say no to the million bucks?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was the catch was you need to do </v>

2771
02:09:39.330 --> 02:09:39.460
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2772
02:09:39.461 --> 02:09:41.480
<v Speaker 2>he was a really good guy actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2773
02:09:41.610 --> 02:09:45.760
<v Speaker 2>I liked him a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The million bucks was,</v>

2774
02:09:46.030 --> 02:09:51.030
<v Speaker 2>he said when you're 30 you'll have a net</v>
<v Speaker 2>worth of a million dollars and if you </v>

2775
02:09:51.030 --> 02:09:54.931
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll write you a check for the whatever </v>

2776
02:09:54.931 --> 02:09:57.140
<v Speaker 2>you're missing and we'll notarize it and</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy's worth $30,000,000</v>

2777
02:09:57.160 --> 02:09:59.650
<v Speaker 2>or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he just wanted you to work for him.</v>

2778
02:09:59.740 --> 02:10:04.740
<v Speaker 2>He wanted me to stay and I wanted to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to see the world and this guy </v>

2779
02:10:04.740 --> 02:10:09.391
<v Speaker 2>hired me to help him manage his family's</v>
<v Speaker 2>property in midtown Manhattan and the </v>

2780
02:10:10.961 --> 02:10:13.660
<v Speaker 2>main reason he hired me is because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't give a shit about money,</v>

2781
02:10:14.290 --> 02:10:16.430
<v Speaker 2>so he knew I wouldn't steal from him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>

2782
02:10:16.530 --> 02:10:21.530
<v Speaker 2>that's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when it stopped being fun and </v>

2783
02:10:21.530 --> 02:10:21.610
<v Speaker 2>knew,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2784
02:10:21.790 --> 02:10:23.050
<v Speaker 2>I got to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

2785
02:10:23.080 --> 02:10:23.560
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2786
02:10:23.590 --> 02:10:25.360
<v Speaker 2>stick around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll make it worth your while.</v>

2787
02:10:25.361 --> 02:10:28.810
<v Speaker 2>And so there was this weird dynamic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>

2788
02:10:28.811 --> 02:10:32.190
<v Speaker 2>I had all these experiences and so I </v>
<v Speaker 2>would wear a piece.</v>

2789
02:10:32.200 --> 02:10:32.970
<v Speaker 2>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

2790
02:10:33.020 --> 02:10:34.100
<v Speaker 2>I've had a good run.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

2791
02:10:34.190 --> 02:10:35.300
<v Speaker 3>anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we finally,</v>

2792
02:10:35.301 --> 02:10:37.340
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we come out into this little parking lot</v>

2793
02:10:37.580 --> 02:10:42.580
<v Speaker 3>and there's this Guatemalan kid there </v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe 10 or something and the Italian </v>

2794
02:10:42.580 --> 02:10:42.740
<v Speaker 3>guy talks to him and says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Scorpion,</v>

2795
02:10:42.741 --> 02:10:44.090
<v Speaker 3>Scorpion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the kid looks at me like,</v>

2796
02:10:44.091 --> 02:10:45.110
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>come,</v>

2797
02:10:45.111 --> 02:10:50.111
<v Speaker 3>come.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he takes us to this trailer and we </v>

2798
02:10:50.111 --> 02:10:52.670
<v Speaker 3>bang on the door and this horrible </v>
<v Speaker 3>fluorescent light comes on.</v>

2799
02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:58.000
<v Speaker 3>And this like Guatemalan Dude who </v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously had been drunk and asleep,</v>

2800
02:10:58.760 --> 02:11:03.760
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like the kid says he's the </v>

2801
02:11:03.760 --> 02:11:03.760
<v Speaker 3>doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not a doctor.</v>

2802
02:11:03.760 --> 02:11:04.460
<v Speaker 3>He's some jungle dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>

2803
02:11:04.970 --> 02:11:08.990
<v Speaker 3>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the guy takes us in and he's talking,</v>

2804
02:11:09.410 --> 02:11:10.820
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's sort of Saki,</v>

2805
02:11:10.821 --> 02:11:12.710
<v Speaker 3>broken English,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I explained to him,</v>

2806
02:11:12.711 --> 02:11:14.060
<v Speaker 3>he says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how big is the Scorpion?</v>

2807
02:11:14.061 --> 02:11:15.050
<v Speaker 3>He looks at my foot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He says,</v>

2808
02:11:15.051 --> 02:11:16.350
<v Speaker 3>how big was the Scorpion?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I say,</v>

2809
02:11:16.351 --> 02:11:17.840
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like this big,</v>

2810
02:11:17.870 --> 02:11:19.840
<v Speaker 3>like a finger and what color?</v>

2811
02:11:19.870 --> 02:11:21.350
<v Speaker 3>Gray,</v>
<v Speaker 3>green sort of.</v>

2812
02:11:21.710 --> 02:11:22.700
<v Speaker 3>And he says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>

2813
02:11:22.701 --> 02:11:23.040
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2814
02:11:23.050 --> 02:11:24.440
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not a scorpion.</v>

2815
02:11:24.770 --> 02:11:29.770
<v Speaker 3>That's electron.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in Spanish and that part of </v>

2816
02:11:29.770 --> 02:11:29.770
<v Speaker 3>Guatemala.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>

2817
02:11:29.770 --> 02:11:33.800
<v Speaker 3>they're two different words.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A squat beyond is a little red thing.</v>

2818
02:11:34.820 --> 02:11:39.820
<v Speaker 3>Electron is a big green thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're both with the tail and the,</v>

2819
02:11:39.920 --> 02:11:42.080
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

2820
02:11:42.320 --> 02:11:45.890
<v Speaker 3>so we had been using the word Scorpion </v>
<v Speaker 3>because in English that's all there is.</v>

2821
02:11:46.340 --> 02:11:51.340
<v Speaker 3>But Scorpion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Scorpion in that part of Guatemala is </v>

2822
02:11:51.340 --> 02:11:55.541
<v Speaker 3>lethal and that's a little tiny thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a little red thing and that'll </v>

2823
02:11:55.541 --> 02:11:57.080
<v Speaker 3>fucking take you out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the guys like,</v>

2824
02:11:57.081 --> 02:11:57.800
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're still,</v>

2825
02:11:57.801 --> 02:12:00.140
<v Speaker 3>this was two hours ago and you're still </v>
<v Speaker 3>alive.</v>

2826
02:12:00.141 --> 02:12:05.141
<v Speaker 3>You'll be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Apparently it's like if you have a bad </v>

2827
02:12:05.141 --> 02:12:06.230
<v Speaker 3>heart or you're a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe this will kill you.</v>

2828
02:12:06.231 --> 02:12:09.050
<v Speaker 3>But if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you survive a couple hours,</v>

2829
02:12:09.051 --> 02:12:11.840
<v Speaker 3>you're going to be speaking to something</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've read today.</v>

2830
02:12:12.170 --> 02:12:16.070
<v Speaker 3>Something about the Atkins Guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is an interesting story.</v>

2831
02:12:16.460 --> 02:12:17.900
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Atkins Diet.</v>

2832
02:12:18.380 --> 02:12:23.120
<v Speaker 3>It's very controversial because diet is </v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of protein stuff.</v>

2833
02:12:23.370 --> 02:12:26.870
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had heard that the guy died of a heart</v>

2834
02:12:26.871 --> 02:12:31.871
<v Speaker 3>attack and that they weren't being </v>
<v Speaker 3>completely honest as apparently even </v>

2835
02:12:32.661 --> 02:12:37.661
<v Speaker 3>snopes says it's not clear the guy had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he felt like he was the head of like,</v>

2836
02:12:38.960 --> 02:12:42.230
<v Speaker 3>it's so weird when this happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Atkins Diet Guy,</v>

2837
02:12:42.260 --> 02:12:44.060
<v Speaker 3>when he died,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he weighed 258 pounds,</v>

2838
02:12:44.180 --> 02:12:46.580
<v Speaker 3>so he was overweight and he was 72 years</v>
<v Speaker 3>old.</v>

2839
02:12:47.480 --> 02:12:51.590
<v Speaker 3>And the story was that he slipped on ice</v>
<v Speaker 3>in front of his house and hit his head.</v>

2840
02:12:52.490 --> 02:12:57.490
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he also had a history of heart </v>

2841
02:12:57.490 --> 02:12:57.920
<v Speaker 3>disease.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did not know that.</v>

2842
02:12:57.950 --> 02:13:02.950
<v Speaker 3>And he had had heart attacks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that why he got into the research </v>

2843
02:13:02.950 --> 02:13:04.610
<v Speaker 3>that led to the Diet?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2844
02:13:04.730 --> 02:13:05.890
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just read that today.</v>

2845
02:13:05.900 --> 02:13:10.900
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's some conspiracy in was it was a </v>

2846
02:13:10.900 --> 02:13:13.870
<v Speaker 3>Vegan guy who was talking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's a conspiracy about adkins </v>

2847
02:13:13.870 --> 02:13:15.290
<v Speaker 3>and that Atkins really died from a heart</v>
<v Speaker 3>attack,</v>

2848
02:13:15.320 --> 02:13:19.340
<v Speaker 3>which would ruin the brand when that </v>
<v Speaker 3>found he was 258 pounds.</v>

2849
02:13:19.341 --> 02:13:19.970
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wait,</v>

2850
02:13:20.090 --> 02:13:21.980
<v Speaker 3>how weight?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's heavy.</v>

2851
02:13:22.070 --> 02:13:23.840
<v Speaker 3>How tall was he?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The report concludes,</v>

2852
02:13:23.841 --> 02:13:28.841
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dr Atkins 72 at a history of heart </v>

2853
02:13:28.841 --> 02:13:30.761
<v Speaker 3>attack and congestive heart failure and </v>
<v Speaker 3>notes that he weighed 258 pounds at</v>

2854
02:13:32.040 --> 02:13:32.630
<v Speaker 6>death.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2855
02:13:33.270 --> 02:13:38.190
<v Speaker 6>So he was really unhealthy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is really interesting because that</v>

2856
02:13:38.400 --> 02:13:41.070
<v Speaker 6>whole diet,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the Atkins Diet,</v>

2857
02:13:41.100 --> 02:13:46.100
<v Speaker 6>like a lot of people were really </v>
<v Speaker 6>criticizing that diet and saying that </v>

2858
02:13:47.941 --> 02:13:52.941
<v Speaker 6>it's really terrible and all the fat and</v>
<v Speaker 6>all this stuff to all the protein you </v>

2859
02:13:52.941 --> 02:13:53.760
<v Speaker 6>eat,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you really shouldn't eat that much.</v>

2860
02:13:54.630 --> 02:13:59.630
<v Speaker 6>But it's very similar to what a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 6>people are eating now when they're </v>

2861
02:13:59.630 --> 02:14:00.090
<v Speaker 6>eating Paleo and they're eating low </v>
<v Speaker 6>carb.</v>

2862
02:14:00.720 --> 02:14:05.720
<v Speaker 6>Apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The real problem within our read this </v>

2863
02:14:05.720 --> 02:14:08.790
<v Speaker 6>today about fat,</v>
<v Speaker 6>high fat diets is if you're going to eat</v>

2864
02:14:08.791 --> 02:14:11.460
<v Speaker 6>a high fat diet and must be a low carb </v>
<v Speaker 6>diet as well,</v>

2865
02:14:11.640 --> 02:14:16.640
<v Speaker 6>you cannot have high,</v>
<v Speaker 6>high fat and carbs that is really bad </v>

2866
02:14:16.640 --> 02:14:20.571
<v Speaker 6>for you because your body's going to use</v>
<v Speaker 6>all the carbohydrates for fuel and all </v>

2867
02:14:20.571 --> 02:14:24.381
<v Speaker 6>the fat that you eat.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's just going to be stored and </v>

2868
02:14:24.381 --> 02:14:27.200
<v Speaker 6>apparently that combination,</v>
<v Speaker 6>especially with saturated fats is very </v>

2869
02:14:27.200 --> 02:14:27.200
<v Speaker 6>bad.</v>

2870
02:14:27.200 --> 02:14:30.450
<v Speaker 6>So you want to be ketogenic or or you </v>
<v Speaker 6>want to be close to it,</v>

2871
02:14:30.840 --> 02:14:31.570
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you wanna,</v>

2872
02:14:31.590 --> 02:14:36.390
<v Speaker 6>you essentially want to eliminate most </v>
<v Speaker 6>of the stuff that people love.</v>

2873
02:14:36.870 --> 02:14:40.710
<v Speaker 6>Pizza and bread and pasta eliminate </v>
<v Speaker 6>almost all that stuff.</v>

2874
02:14:41.100 --> 02:14:44.880
<v Speaker 6>That's just all those unnatural foods,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but the point being that I'd never heard</v>

2875
02:14:44.881 --> 02:14:47.850
<v Speaker 6>that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've always heard that he had fallen and</v>

2876
02:14:48.170 --> 02:14:51.510
<v Speaker 6>I'd assumed that anything other than </v>
<v Speaker 6>that would be a conspiracy theory,</v>

2877
02:14:52.200 --> 02:14:53.730
<v Speaker 6>but then I read that and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whoa.</v>

2878
02:14:54.270 --> 02:14:59.270
<v Speaker 6>You know who wrote it?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Now remember John Joseph from the Cro </v>

2879
02:14:59.270 --> 02:14:59.270
<v Speaker 6>mags.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know that guy's a Vegan,</v>

2880
02:14:59.760 --> 02:15:02.420
<v Speaker 6>super healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>ultra marathon,</v>

2881
02:15:02.470 --> 02:15:06.090
<v Speaker 6>a triathlon dude.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Now he used to be.</v>

2882
02:15:06.180 --> 02:15:08.370
<v Speaker 6>We still is lead singer,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the chromatics.</v>

2883
02:15:08.400 --> 02:15:10.230
<v Speaker 6>I think they're still around.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I know he tore.</v>

2884
02:15:10.240 --> 02:15:14.400
<v Speaker 6>Still might be torn on his own now,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but he wrote that about Atkins today.</v>

2885
02:15:14.500 --> 02:15:14.810
<v Speaker 6>I was on.</v>

2886
02:15:17.030 --> 02:15:18.530
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2887
02:15:18.531 --> 02:15:22.730
<v Speaker 4>just to tie this together.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The guy after he explains this to me,</v>

2888
02:15:23.300 --> 02:15:28.300
<v Speaker 4>he gives me a couple pills,</v>
<v Speaker 4>probably aspirin or something and he dip</v>

2889
02:15:28.961 --> 02:15:31.100
<v Speaker 4>some water out of a bucket and says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>take these pills.</v>

2890
02:15:31.101 --> 02:15:33.860
<v Speaker 4>You'll be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd been traveling a long time.</v>

2891
02:15:33.861 --> 02:15:36.860
<v Speaker 4>I knew you don't drink water out of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>bucket and the tropics,</v>

2892
02:15:36.861 --> 02:15:38.720
<v Speaker 4>but this guy just told me I wasn't going</v>
<v Speaker 4>to die,</v>

2893
02:15:38.721 --> 02:15:43.721
<v Speaker 4>so I'll do whatever the fuck he says.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I drank the water and a week later </v>

2894
02:15:43.721 --> 02:15:43.721
<v Speaker 4>and hepatitis.</v>

2895
02:15:43.721 --> 02:15:44.830
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>

2896
02:15:44.900 --> 02:15:49.820
<v Speaker 4>You got the hepatitis hepatitis from a </v>
<v Speaker 4>bucket of this dude had laying around as</v>

2897
02:15:50.030 --> 02:15:53.230
<v Speaker 4>dirty shed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's crazy.</v>

2898
02:15:53.240 --> 02:15:54.070
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's.</v>

2899
02:15:54.080 --> 02:15:56.860
<v Speaker 4>You narrowed it down to that particular </v>
<v Speaker 4>moment that you got hepatitis,</v>

2900
02:15:57.350 --> 02:15:59.890
<v Speaker 4>but I assume,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's a pretty high risk for.</v>

2901
02:16:00.020 --> 02:16:01.740
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2902
02:16:02.030 --> 02:16:03.410
<v Speaker 4>Fucking crazy people with their guts</v>

2903
02:16:03.430 --> 02:16:05.230
<v Speaker 6>biome down there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2904
02:16:05.231 --> 02:16:10.150
<v Speaker 6>they can.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like if you see other animals drink</v>

2905
02:16:10.151 --> 02:16:11.560
<v Speaker 6>out of a puddle,</v>
<v Speaker 6>do you freak out?</v>

2906
02:16:11.730 --> 02:16:12.420
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2907
02:16:12.500 --> 02:16:13.910
<v Speaker 4>like a dog drinks out of public,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2908
02:16:13.920 --> 02:16:16.310
<v Speaker 4>freak out because the dog's got bodies </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to handle that.</v>

2909
02:16:16.340 --> 02:16:21.340
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what Jeff Leach was telling me </v>

2910
02:16:21.340 --> 02:16:22.721
<v Speaker 4>about the Hudson.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They drink right out of mud puddles all </v>

2911
02:16:22.721 --> 02:16:22.721
<v Speaker 4>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

2912
02:16:22.721 --> 02:16:23.690
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's why he wanted their microbiome.</v>

2913
02:16:24.640 --> 02:16:25.370
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2914
02:16:25.371 --> 02:16:29.420
<v Speaker 4>We have a weak ass bitch ass </v>
<v Speaker 4>preservative laden microbiome</v>

2915
02:16:30.460 --> 02:16:32.680
<v Speaker 3>antibiotics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can avoid them.</v>

2916
02:16:33.310 --> 02:16:35.980
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to stay alive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2917
02:16:36.030 --> 02:16:37.090
<v Speaker 3>if you get really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>

2918
02:16:37.091 --> 02:16:37.840
<v Speaker 3>really sad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2919
02:16:37.841 --> 02:16:40.570
<v Speaker 3>I'm not talking about medical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking about in the food supply,</v>

2920
02:16:40.640 --> 02:16:42.880
<v Speaker 3>the water supply.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're everywhere in America.</v>

2921
02:16:42.881 --> 02:16:45.580
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if that really affects us </v>
<v Speaker 3>that much.</v>

2922
02:16:45.610 --> 02:16:46.840
<v Speaker 3>They.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the things that I was.</v>

2923
02:16:47.020 --> 02:16:52.020
<v Speaker 3>I don't think there's levels of </v>
<v Speaker 3>antibiotics in the water supply that's </v>

2924
02:16:52.020 --> 02:16:53.920
<v Speaker 3>really affecting us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's possible that some of it is getting</v>

2925
02:16:53.921 --> 02:16:57.520
<v Speaker 3>to us in the food supply,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but more so than not,</v>

2926
02:16:57.521 --> 02:17:01.960
<v Speaker 3>I think the issue is poor dietary </v>
<v Speaker 3>choices because poor dietary choices are</v>

2927
02:17:01.961 --> 02:17:04.840
<v Speaker 3>the number one factor and what affects </v>
<v Speaker 3>your microbiome.</v>

2928
02:17:04.841 --> 02:17:07.750
<v Speaker 3>Super Low fiber,</v>
<v Speaker 3>low fiber.</v>

2929
02:17:08.110 --> 02:17:13.110
<v Speaker 3>Just not just not eating healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're eating a lot of sugar in </v>

2930
02:17:13.110 --> 02:17:16.141
<v Speaker 3>particular,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got candida running around your </v>

2931
02:17:16.141 --> 02:17:18.211
<v Speaker 3>gut and they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the unhealthy bacteria reacts better to </v>

2932
02:17:18.211 --> 02:17:19.870
<v Speaker 3>that and your body starts craving it.</v>

2933
02:17:20.020 --> 02:17:25.020
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the weirdest things about </v>
<v Speaker 3>when you do eat a low carb diet is your </v>

2934
02:17:25.020 --> 02:17:26.380
<v Speaker 3>body's really doesn't crave </v>
<v Speaker 3>carbohydrates anymore.</v>

2935
02:17:26.650 --> 02:17:29.470
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's a trick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when you're on carbohydrates,</v>

2936
02:17:29.471 --> 02:17:32.080
<v Speaker 3>if you eat them a lot and your body's </v>
<v Speaker 3>craving them all the time,</v>

2937
02:17:32.470 --> 02:17:37.470
<v Speaker 3>it's like you are being influenced by </v>
<v Speaker 3>those organisms that are in your </v>

2938
02:17:37.470 --> 02:17:38.500
<v Speaker 3>digestive tract,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is really freaky.</v>

2939
02:17:39.100 --> 02:17:44.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's the whole sort of super </v>

2940
02:17:44.100 --> 02:17:47.011
<v Speaker 3>organism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you and I've talked about that </v>

2941
02:17:47.011 --> 02:17:49.171
<v Speaker 3>in the past,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea that w toxoplasmosis you know </v>

2942
02:17:49.171 --> 02:17:53.520
<v Speaker 3>about that she says these things that </v>
<v Speaker 3>get into the brain and determine </v>

2943
02:17:53.520 --> 02:17:56.350
<v Speaker 3>behavior and from the gut as well can </v>
<v Speaker 3>determine.</v>

2944
02:17:56.380 --> 02:17:59.380
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not even something as simple as a simple</v>

2945
02:17:59.381 --> 02:18:04.381
<v Speaker 3>example of like wanting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wanting the organism to crave the thing </v>

2946
02:18:04.381 --> 02:18:04.670
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

2947
02:18:04.870 --> 02:18:07.330
<v Speaker 3>that works for them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but not for the organism,</v>

2948
02:18:07.960 --> 02:18:09.370
<v Speaker 3>but man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that weird,</v>

2949
02:18:09.640 --> 02:18:14.620
<v Speaker 3>like really complex behaviors that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>created by some parasites in the brain,</v>

2950
02:18:14.710 --> 02:18:17.170
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like cats that are,</v>

2951
02:18:17.171 --> 02:18:22.171
<v Speaker 3>are mice that aren't afraid of cats and </v>
<v Speaker 3>are actually attracted to the smell of </v>

2952
02:18:22.171 --> 02:18:22.270
<v Speaker 3>cat piss.</v>

2953
02:18:22.270 --> 02:18:23.670
<v Speaker 3>Sexually attracted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2954
02:18:23.680 --> 02:18:26.110
<v Speaker 3>They get turned off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>

2955
02:18:26.111 --> 02:18:31.111
<v Speaker 3>And that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that bacteria or this toxoplasmosis can </v>

2956
02:18:31.111 --> 02:18:34.600
<v Speaker 3>only grow and it can only reproduce </v>
<v Speaker 3>inside a cat's gut.</v>

2957
02:18:34.620 --> 02:18:36.460
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which is fucking bananas.</v>

2958
02:18:36.880 --> 02:18:38.620
<v Speaker 3>Like Paul Ski,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

2959
02:18:38.730 --> 02:18:39.630
<v Speaker 3>Paul,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ski Roberts,</v>

2960
02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:43.680
<v Speaker 3>he's great and he went into depth about </v>
<v Speaker 3>that and it's just,</v>

2961
02:18:43.690 --> 02:18:45.310
<v Speaker 3>it's one of those things where you just </v>
<v Speaker 3>stop and go.</v>

2962
02:18:45.311 --> 02:18:46.990
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a cool guy.</v>

2963
02:18:46.991 --> 02:18:50.750
<v Speaker 3>I remember mentioning him to you once on</v>
<v Speaker 3>this podcast and Jamie brought up is his</v>

2964
02:18:50.770 --> 02:18:54.850
<v Speaker 3>photo and you looked at his photo and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you said there's a guy who does not give</v>

2965
02:18:54.851 --> 02:18:59.851
<v Speaker 3>a fuck if you look at it was crazy </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking hair ponytail.</v>

2966
02:19:00.910 --> 02:19:02.660
<v Speaker 3>He's homeless.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's just,</v>

2967
02:19:02.830 --> 02:19:05.830
<v Speaker 3>he's interested in the work here yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2968
02:19:06.060 --> 02:19:07.090
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The work,</v>

2969
02:19:07.170 --> 02:19:09.220
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he was gracious enough to give us an</v>

2970
02:19:09.221 --> 02:19:14.221
<v Speaker 3>hour there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He is right there for a super nice guy </v>

2971
02:19:14.221 --> 02:19:14.221
<v Speaker 3>too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but just A.</v>

2972
02:19:14.221 --> 02:19:18.530
<v Speaker 3>I mean his work with baboons as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was covered in a radiolab podcast is </v>

2973
02:19:18.791 --> 02:19:23.791
<v Speaker 3>fascinating podcasts with the observed </v>
<v Speaker 3>like this baboons is temporary baboo in </v>

2974
02:19:23.791 --> 02:19:24.770
<v Speaker 3>utopia where.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2975
02:19:24.830 --> 02:19:28.330
<v Speaker 3>you and I talked about that where the </v>
<v Speaker 3>upper ranking males</v>

2976
02:19:28.330 --> 02:19:30.800
<v Speaker 4>eight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the contaminated meat and died out.</v>

2977
02:19:31.100 --> 02:19:32.350
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love that story.</v>

2978
02:19:32.780 --> 02:19:36.050
<v Speaker 4>It's one of the only hopeful fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>stories out there.</v>

2979
02:19:36.100 --> 02:19:41.100
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I feel like there's certain pockets of </v>

2980
02:19:41.100 --> 02:19:41.100
<v Speaker 5>humanity like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean I've never been to burning man,</v>

2981
02:19:41.100 --> 02:19:43.690
<v Speaker 5>but I assume that that's sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 5>representation of that as well.</v>

2982
02:19:43.990 --> 02:19:48.990
<v Speaker 5>Certain pockets of humanity were </v>
<v Speaker 5>likeminded people get together and they </v>

2983
02:19:48.990 --> 02:19:48.990
<v Speaker 5>say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2984
02:19:48.990 --> 02:19:51.310
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't have to be like this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like just because we're all caught up in</v>

2985
02:19:51.311 --> 02:19:56.311
<v Speaker 5>this crazy trap and I think more of </v>
<v Speaker 5>those little pockets of humanity are </v>

2986
02:19:56.311 --> 02:19:58.720
<v Speaker 5>popping up day in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>day out.</v>

2987
02:19:59.060 --> 02:20:02.080
<v Speaker 5>I think this podcast represents that and</v>
<v Speaker 5>a lot of way to,</v>

2988
02:20:02.130 --> 02:20:07.130
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're talking about the podcast being a </v>

2989
02:20:07.130 --> 02:20:08.581
<v Speaker 5>cult of its own creation in in some way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I think it's more of a community.</v>

2990
02:20:09.420 --> 02:20:11.770
<v Speaker 5>Well no one's asking you to do anything </v>
<v Speaker 5>and there's no,</v>

2991
02:20:11.800 --> 02:20:13.240
<v Speaker 5>there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2992
02:20:13.480 --> 02:20:15.490
<v Speaker 5>there's no rules,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's,</v>

2993
02:20:15.610 --> 02:20:20.610
<v Speaker 5>it's an opportunity for likeminded </v>
<v Speaker 5>discussion that's rarely present in </v>

2994
02:20:22.150 --> 02:20:23.080
<v Speaker 5>cubicle life.</v>

2995
02:20:23.390 --> 02:20:28.390
<v Speaker 4>When I think about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean podcasts are in the intro to </v>

2996
02:20:28.390 --> 02:20:31.591
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this podcast book we were talking about </v>

2997
02:20:31.591 --> 02:20:33.601
<v Speaker 4>earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I said that I think that podcasting is </v>

2998
02:20:33.611 --> 02:20:38.611
<v Speaker 4>on a par with the invention of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>printing press in terms of the potential</v>

2999
02:20:38.951 --> 02:20:43.951
<v Speaker 4>for radical social change because </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no,</v>

3000
02:20:44.350 --> 02:20:46.300
<v Speaker 4>like you said before,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no filter.</v>

3001
02:20:46.360 --> 02:20:51.360
<v Speaker 4>There's nothing between you and your </v>
<v Speaker 4>audience and that's a radical thing.</v>

3002
02:20:52.450 --> 02:20:56.980
<v Speaker 4>I mean the printing press said w when </v>
<v Speaker 4>the printing press came about,</v>

3003
02:20:56.981 --> 02:21:01.981
<v Speaker 4>what that meant was you didn't need to </v>
<v Speaker 4>have a team of scribes to copy out this </v>

3004
02:21:03.250 --> 02:21:04.350
<v Speaker 4>thing that you've written.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3005
02:21:04.370 --> 02:21:07.420
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you can be just a regular guy and pay</v>

3006
02:21:07.430 --> 02:21:12.430
<v Speaker 4>the thousand bucks or whatever the </v>
<v Speaker 4>equivalent of that was in medieval </v>

3007
02:21:12.430 --> 02:21:15.361
<v Speaker 4>Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And have all these pamphlets printed so </v>

3008
02:21:15.361 --> 02:21:18.070
<v Speaker 4>you could be Martin Luther and change </v>
<v Speaker 4>the world if you have a good idea and it</v>

3009
02:21:18.071 --> 02:21:21.860
<v Speaker 4>takes hold.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Podcasting seems similar to that in in,</v>

3010
02:21:21.910 --> 02:21:26.910
<v Speaker 4>in the sense that anybody who can afford</v>
<v Speaker 4>a few mikes in a laptop can get their </v>

3011
02:21:27.281 --> 02:21:32.281
<v Speaker 4>message out and if it catches fire,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it catches fire it and it goes around </v>

3012
02:21:32.281 --> 02:21:32.680
<v Speaker 4>the world.</v>

3013
02:21:33.090 --> 02:21:38.090
<v Speaker 5>You could do it on a phone to look.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're saying you don't really need a </v>

3014
02:21:38.090 --> 02:21:40.701
<v Speaker 5>whole lot of equipment.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A lot of people use one of those small </v>

3015
02:21:40.701 --> 02:21:40.701
<v Speaker 5>mp3 Mike's a zoom.</v>

3016
02:21:40.701 --> 02:21:42.540
<v Speaker 4>We use that early on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I still use a zoom.</v>

3017
02:21:43.050 --> 02:21:43.870
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I</v>

3018
02:21:43.890 --> 02:21:46.570
<v Speaker 5>see.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think maybe I think you probably.</v>

3019
02:21:46.571 --> 02:21:51.571
<v Speaker 5>You're onto something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think the Internet in general and the </v>

3020
02:21:51.571 --> 02:21:51.610
<v Speaker 5>ability for people to just create their </v>
<v Speaker 5>own content,</v>

3021
02:21:51.910 --> 02:21:56.910
<v Speaker 5>that's the real.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The gatekeepers to the masses have </v>

3022
02:21:56.910 --> 02:22:00.820
<v Speaker 5>always been these production companies,</v>
<v Speaker 5>content provider's networks,</v>

3023
02:22:01.030 --> 02:22:06.030
<v Speaker 5>all these people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the hallowed halls and those people all </v>

3024
02:22:06.030 --> 02:22:08.520
<v Speaker 5>got fat on it and a weird way because </v>
<v Speaker 5>the gatekeepers are the ones that </v>

3025
02:22:08.520 --> 02:22:11.260
<v Speaker 5>hoarded all the money and then they gave</v>
<v Speaker 5>some of the money to the actors and some</v>

3026
02:22:11.261 --> 02:22:13.600
<v Speaker 5>of the money to the writers and </v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody got wealthy,</v>

3027
02:22:13.601 --> 02:22:15.280
<v Speaker 5>don't get me wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the gate,</v>

3028
02:22:15.281 --> 02:22:18.100
<v Speaker 5>the Harvey Weinsteins of the world is </v>
<v Speaker 5>the one that really got rich.</v>

3029
02:22:18.370 --> 02:22:23.370
<v Speaker 5>If you look at that guy like that guy is</v>
<v Speaker 5>the guy that really got rich and really </v>

3030
02:22:23.370 --> 02:22:23.370
<v Speaker 5>happy to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

3031
02:22:23.370 --> 02:22:25.030
<v Speaker 5>he's doing really well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's doing super.</v>

3032
02:22:25.320 --> 02:22:25.800
<v Speaker 5>That's great.</v>

3033
02:22:26.130 --> 02:22:31.130
<v Speaker 6>He,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean obviously that guy's the worst </v>

3034
02:22:31.130 --> 02:22:31.130
<v Speaker 6>example,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

3035
02:22:31.130 --> 02:22:34.680
<v Speaker 6>But he obviously also on a positive </v>
<v Speaker 6>note,</v>

3036
02:22:34.980 --> 02:22:38.340
<v Speaker 6>financed a lot of amazing movies and if,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if it wasn't for him,</v>

3037
02:22:38.341 --> 02:22:41.010
<v Speaker 6>they wouldn't have gotten done.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But clearly those people that do that,</v>

3038
02:22:41.011 --> 02:22:44.370
<v Speaker 6>there are different thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're business people now is the first</v>

3039
02:22:44.371 --> 02:22:49.371
<v Speaker 6>time ever that there's a direct </v>
<v Speaker 6>connection between a guy like you and a </v>

3040
02:22:50.071 --> 02:22:51.900
<v Speaker 6>guy like whoever's listening to this </v>
<v Speaker 6>right now,</v>

3041
02:22:52.200 --> 02:22:55.410
<v Speaker 6>that's never happened before.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean the only one in the room,</v>

3042
02:22:55.850 --> 02:23:00.850
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we have Jamie helping out and then it </v>

3043
02:23:00.850 --> 02:23:04.461
<v Speaker 6>goes to the server and then it's </v>
<v Speaker 6>uploaded to the rss feed and then it </v>

3044
02:23:04.461 --> 02:23:08.361
<v Speaker 6>goes to itunes and it goes to wherever </v>
<v Speaker 6>the fuck you're getting your podcast </v>

3045
02:23:08.361 --> 02:23:09.660
<v Speaker 6>from and that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's no steps.</v>

3046
02:23:09.661 --> 02:23:11.340
<v Speaker 6>There's no network,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's no notes,</v>

3047
02:23:11.341 --> 02:23:14.730
<v Speaker 6>there's no production.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Meaning if you did your podcast and your</v>

3048
02:23:14.731 --> 02:23:16.950
<v Speaker 6>podcast was on some radio network </v>
<v Speaker 6>somewhere,</v>

3049
02:23:16.951 --> 02:23:19.950
<v Speaker 6>you'd have to go to meetings,</v>
<v Speaker 6>weekly meetings with the studio.</v>

3050
02:23:20.160 --> 02:23:22.590
<v Speaker 6>He'd have some fucking program director,</v>
<v Speaker 6>some Dick.</v>

3051
02:23:22.591 --> 02:23:26.100
<v Speaker 6>Fuck asshole wants to tell you what to </v>
<v Speaker 6>talk about anymore.</v>

3052
02:23:26.340 --> 02:23:27.060
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Look,</v>

3053
02:23:27.061 --> 02:23:28.650
<v Speaker 6>you're losing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're losing sponsors.</v>

3054
02:23:29.300 --> 02:23:31.770
<v Speaker 6>I don't even have advertisers.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Good for you.</v>

3055
02:23:32.080 --> 02:23:37.080
<v Speaker 6>I do it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I had him for awhile and I just got </v>

3056
02:23:37.080 --> 02:23:37.650
<v Speaker 6>tired of listening to myself talking </v>
<v Speaker 6>about underwear and shit.</v>

3057
02:23:38.370 --> 02:23:39.720
<v Speaker 6>So just do it for fun.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

3058
02:23:40.150 --> 02:23:41.750
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's supported through patriot.</v>

3059
02:23:41.790 --> 02:23:44.070
<v Speaker 6>That's great to have people send me </v>
<v Speaker 6>money.</v>

3060
02:23:44.160 --> 02:23:48.120
<v Speaker 6>This is what I think ultimately I think </v>
<v Speaker 6>ultimately people will.</v>

3061
02:23:48.121 --> 02:23:52.860
<v Speaker 6>Someone's going to develop some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 6>an app thing where you can.</v>

3062
02:23:53.190 --> 02:23:58.190
<v Speaker 6>You can like have basically everything </v>
<v Speaker 6>you put out your podcast blogs,</v>

3063
02:23:58.470 --> 02:24:01.050
<v Speaker 6>although it would all be cut like a </v>
<v Speaker 6>channel,</v>

3064
02:24:01.500 --> 02:24:06.500
<v Speaker 6>you could even call it channel and that </v>
<v Speaker 6>would be like a new social media </v>

3065
02:24:06.500 --> 02:24:07.200
<v Speaker 6>platform that you could do everything </v>
<v Speaker 6>from,</v>

3066
02:24:07.770 --> 02:24:12.770
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and people could either sign up for it </v>

3067
02:24:12.770 --> 02:24:13.560
<v Speaker 6>and pay for it or not,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3068
02:24:13.590 --> 02:24:14.880
<v Speaker 6>that's how Sam Harris has it.</v>

3069
02:24:15.210 --> 02:24:17.370
<v Speaker 6>You can either pay for his podcast or </v>
<v Speaker 6>not.</v>

3070
02:24:17.400 --> 02:24:18.480
<v Speaker 6>That's how you have it too,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

3071
02:24:19.050 --> 02:24:20.520
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Although you get it for free.</v>

3072
02:24:20.550 --> 02:24:21.300
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You get it for free.</v>

3073
02:24:21.301 --> 02:24:23.190
<v Speaker 6>So if you want to support,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you want to support it.</v>

3074
02:24:23.200 --> 02:24:24.780
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You pay and I do some,</v>

3075
02:24:24.820 --> 02:24:28.180
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>some bonus stuff for Patriana only.</v>

3076
02:24:28.230 --> 02:24:29.140
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Sam does.</v>

3077
02:24:29.220 --> 02:24:30.810

<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>

3078
02:24:30.880 --> 02:24:31.620
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Why not?</v>

3079
02:24:31.950 --> 02:24:36.950
<v Speaker 6>And I think there's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the future's probably going to be </v>

3080
02:24:36.950 --> 02:24:37.530
<v Speaker 6>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's the present,</v>

3081
02:24:37.560 --> 02:24:38.370
<v Speaker 6>as you said.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

3082
02:24:38.500 --> 02:24:41.400

<v Speaker 6>You got to get a Patriot on Joe.</v>

3084
02:24:43.770 --> 02:24:44.880
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I make some money.</v>

3085
02:24:44.940 --> 02:24:48.270
<v Speaker 6>I make plenty of money with ads.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't.</v>

3086
02:24:48.500 --> 02:24:53.500
<v Speaker 6>I'm trying to think of like what.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's almost like give the option if you </v>

3087
02:24:53.500 --> 02:24:55.440
<v Speaker 6>pay,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you get no ads or a free.</v>

3088
02:24:55.500 --> 02:24:56.550
<v Speaker 6>A lot of people do that.</v>

3089
02:24:56.600 --> 02:24:58.170
<v Speaker 6>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Dan Savage does that.</v>

3090
02:24:58.171 --> 02:25:00.870
<v Speaker 6>He has the.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I forget what it's called,</v>

3091
02:25:00.871 --> 02:25:02.910
<v Speaker 6>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's the ad free version and the.</v>

3092
02:25:03.030 --> 02:25:05.310
<v Speaker 6>That's probably a good month,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if that makes sense,</v>

3093
02:25:05.640 --> 02:25:06.900
<v Speaker 6>because that way if you don't want to </v>
<v Speaker 6>pay for it,</v>

3094
02:25:06.901 --> 02:25:11.190
<v Speaker 6>you don't have to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but the point being that you can reach a</v>

3095
02:25:11.191 --> 02:25:13.260
<v Speaker 6>whole lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 6>forget about paying.</v>

3096
02:25:13.650 --> 02:25:18.650
<v Speaker 6>You can reach a whole lot of people and </v>
<v Speaker 6>get ideas to a whole lot of people that </v>

3097
02:25:18.650 --> 02:25:18.690
<v Speaker 6>you could just never reached before.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No one would let you.</v>

3098
02:25:18.930 --> 02:25:21.900
<v Speaker 6>Why would anybody invest in you?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Why would they even put that time in and</v>

3099
02:25:21.901 --> 02:25:23.800
<v Speaker 6>then you're going to keep all of it a </v>
<v Speaker 6>lot.</v>

3100
02:25:24.180 --> 02:25:26.410
<v Speaker 4>No Way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you think about publishing now,</v>

3101
02:25:26.470 --> 02:25:28.840
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I write a book that bill comes out.</v>

3102
02:25:28.841 --> 02:25:31.950
<v Speaker 4>Somebody buys a copy of sex at dawn.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right now in paperback,</v>

3103
02:25:32.170 --> 02:25:36.300
<v Speaker 4>I get eight point two,</v>
<v Speaker 4>five percent of the.</v>

3104
02:25:36.410 --> 02:25:39.910
<v Speaker 4>Of the price.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's minus 15 percent of that.</v>

3105
02:25:39.911 --> 02:25:43.810
<v Speaker 4>That goes to my agent and then taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's Hilarious,</v>

3106
02:25:43.840 --> 02:25:45.520
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean a pimp,</v>

3107
02:25:45.521 --> 02:25:47.980
<v Speaker 4>let's a hooker keep 50 percent of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>money.</v>

3108
02:25:48.620 --> 02:25:50.530
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A stingy pam.</v>

3109
02:25:50.590 --> 02:25:53.830
<v Speaker 4>What is a gate lady like?</v>
<v Speaker 4>J Dot k dot rowling's when she's balling</v>

3110
02:25:53.831 --> 02:25:55.540
<v Speaker 4>on top of the world kind of deal as she </v>
<v Speaker 4>get.</v>

3111
02:25:56.040 --> 02:25:58.230
<v Speaker 4>What depends what she signed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3112
02:25:58.330 --> 02:26:01.410
<v Speaker 4>but I mean she's already like Stephen </v>
<v Speaker 4>King.</v>

3113
02:26:01.510 --> 02:26:04.210
<v Speaker 4>People that occur,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they can cut a totally different deal,</v>

3114
02:26:05.020 --> 02:26:07.900
<v Speaker 4>but the standard contract is what I had,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which was,</v>

3115
02:26:08.380 --> 02:26:11.170
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>eight percent on hard copy.</v>

3116
02:26:11.171 --> 02:26:13.210
<v Speaker 4>It's eight percent for 5,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>copies,</v>

3117
02:26:13.211 --> 02:26:15.220
<v Speaker 4>then 10 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>5,012</v>

3118
02:26:15.221 --> 02:26:17.350
<v Speaker 4>percent after that in hard copy.</v>

3119
02:26:17.710 --> 02:26:20.500
<v Speaker 4>And then paper bag is eight point two,</v>
<v Speaker 4>five percent forever.</v>

3120
02:26:20.501 --> 02:26:25.501
<v Speaker 4>How many books have you sold in America?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe $400,000.</v>

3121
02:26:25.631 --> 02:26:27.940
<v Speaker 4>Four hundred 50,000,</v>
<v Speaker 4>something like that.</v>

3122
02:26:28.350 --> 02:26:30.160
<v Speaker 4>It's a lot of books.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not really.</v>

3123
02:26:30.640 --> 02:26:33.250
<v Speaker 4>Not really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's 20 languages.</v>

3124
02:26:33.251 --> 02:26:36.760
<v Speaker 4>That's what's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's worldwide filled with 400,000.</v>

3125
02:26:36.860 --> 02:26:38.500
<v Speaker 4>It's a lot of books.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you look at it that way,</v>

3126
02:26:38.501 --> 02:26:40.510
<v Speaker 4>that's how you have to learn what it </v>
<v Speaker 4>really is.</v>

3127
02:26:41.430 --> 02:26:44.590
<v Speaker 4>But in terms of money,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not that much money,</v>

3128
02:26:44.860 --> 02:26:46.250
<v Speaker 4>especially if you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3129
02:26:46.330 --> 02:26:51.330
<v Speaker 4>stretch it out over the years it took to</v>
<v Speaker 4>write it and all the promotion and all </v>

3130
02:26:51.330 --> 02:26:55.471
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not a way to make a lot of money </v>

3131
02:26:55.471 --> 02:26:55.471
<v Speaker 4>writing books.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even it used to be,</v>

3132
02:26:55.471 --> 02:26:57.190
<v Speaker 4>if you had a New York Times bestseller </v>
<v Speaker 4>back in the day,</v>

3133
02:26:57.191 --> 02:27:01.240
<v Speaker 4>you've made a lot of money really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the reading audience is much smaller</v>

3134
02:27:01.241 --> 02:27:03.160
<v Speaker 4>now than it was 20,</v>
<v Speaker 4>30 years ago.</v>

3135
02:27:03.250 --> 02:27:08.250
<v Speaker 4>What about books on cassette or audio?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a different deal.</v>

3136
02:27:08.321 --> 02:27:10.730
<v Speaker 4>You signed a deal generally with </v>
<v Speaker 4>audible,</v>

3137
02:27:10.810 --> 02:27:15.130
<v Speaker 4>they sort of own that market which is an</v>
<v Speaker 4>Amazon company,</v>

3138
02:27:15.160 --> 02:27:17.140
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

3139
02:27:17.141 --> 02:27:18.130
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you get,</v>

3140
02:27:18.131 --> 02:27:23.131
<v Speaker 4>I forget what the percentages,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's probably 18 to 20 something </v>

3141
02:27:23.131 --> 02:27:24.220
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And also,</v>

3142
02:27:24.221 --> 02:27:26.920
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ebooks you get a slightly better deal.</v>

3143
02:27:26.921 --> 02:27:30.400
<v Speaker 4>I think you get 17 and a half percent of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the price of an Ebook,</v>

3144
02:27:30.700 --> 02:27:35.700
<v Speaker 4>which is funny though because it's not </v>
<v Speaker 4>costing the publisher anything </v>

3145
02:27:35.700 --> 02:27:38.020
<v Speaker 4>additional to have an Ebook,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's already edited,</v>

3146
02:27:38.021 --> 02:27:43.021
<v Speaker 4>it's already the cover and all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's already done and there's no </v>

3147
02:27:43.021 --> 02:27:46.831
<v Speaker 4>distribution cost.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you get 17 and a half percent as a </v>

3148
02:27:46.831 --> 02:27:47.170
<v Speaker 4>writer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they get the rest.</v>

3149
02:27:47.200 --> 02:27:48.760
<v Speaker 4>That's so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no trucks,</v>

3150
02:27:48.761 --> 02:27:50.500
<v Speaker 4>there's no shelf,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no store,</v>

3151
02:27:50.530 --> 02:27:52.420
<v Speaker 4>no reason for them to be getting all </v>
<v Speaker 4>that money.</v>

3152
02:27:52.750 --> 02:27:54.760
<v Speaker 4>That's so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's all gravy for them.</v>

3153
02:27:54.840 --> 02:27:59.840
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's not like they're recouping </v>

3154
02:27:59.840 --> 02:28:00.910
<v Speaker 4>costs and it used to be like back in </v>
<v Speaker 4>hemingway or whatever,</v>

3155
02:28:01.060 --> 02:28:06.060
<v Speaker 4>back in the day a publisher would,</v>
<v Speaker 4>would support an author through three,</v>

3156
02:28:06.110 --> 02:28:09.160
<v Speaker 4>four or five books,</v>
<v Speaker 4>thinking eventually something's going to</v>

3157
02:28:09.161 --> 02:28:14.161
<v Speaker 4>hit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This guy has got talent eventually and </v>

3158
02:28:14.161 --> 02:28:17.161
<v Speaker 4>so it was an investment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now they expect you to have your own </v>

3159
02:28:17.161 --> 02:28:17.161
<v Speaker 4>platform,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your own access to media.</v>

3160
02:28:17.161 --> 02:28:21.190
<v Speaker 4>You sometimes they're asking authors to </v>
<v Speaker 4>hire their own editors,</v>

3161
02:28:21.470 --> 02:28:23.030
<v Speaker 4>their own publicists,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3162
02:28:23.031 --> 02:28:23.870
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3163
02:28:24.230 --> 02:28:29.230
<v Speaker 4>But they still get all the money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They still get the same contract that </v>

3164
02:28:29.230 --> 02:28:29.230
<v Speaker 4>the ratios are the same.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's like.</v>

3165
02:28:29.230 --> 02:28:34.211
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's why I say it's like a napster </v>

3166
02:28:34.211 --> 02:28:34.211
<v Speaker 4>kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's at the point now where it's like,</v>

3167
02:28:34.211 --> 02:28:35.790
<v Speaker 4>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I got a platform,</v>

3168
02:28:35.930 --> 02:28:38.360
<v Speaker 4>I got access to media,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm hiring my own editor.</v>

3169
02:28:38.510 --> 02:28:41.450
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why am I giving you creative control?</v>

3170
02:28:41.810 --> 02:28:45.080
<v Speaker 4>And Ninety two percent of the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>revenue.</v>

3171
02:28:45.540 --> 02:28:49.280
<v Speaker 4>It's a strange business.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is a strange business.</v>

3172
02:28:49.330 --> 02:28:52.850
<v Speaker 4>Now essentially what they have is </v>
<v Speaker 4>credibility.</v>

3173
02:28:52.940 --> 02:28:56.120
<v Speaker 4>So if you self publish or publish with </v>
<v Speaker 4>some independent publisher,</v>

3174
02:28:56.580 --> 02:29:00.370
<v Speaker 4>The New York Times isn't going to review</v>
<v Speaker 4>it or won't know.</v>

3175
02:29:00.890 --> 02:29:03.560
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because it's a very insular world.</v>

3176
02:29:04.320 --> 02:29:07.460
<v Speaker 4>Well that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If it's a book that takes off,</v>

3177
02:29:07.700 --> 02:29:11.720
<v Speaker 4>then a publisher will come in and buy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So like 50 shades of gray.</v>

3178
02:29:11.721 --> 02:29:13.670
<v Speaker 4>That was self published.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wonder why.</v>

3179
02:29:14.110 --> 02:29:16.120
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But look what happens.</v>

3180
02:29:16.220 --> 02:29:17.900
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They found they tapped into a market.</v>

3181
02:29:17.901 --> 02:29:20.460
<v Speaker 4>A chick that let's get spit on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3182
02:29:20.490 --> 02:29:22.010
<v Speaker 4>There are a lot of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of them,</v>

3183
02:29:22.180 --> 02:29:24.820
<v Speaker 4>I don't know about their hood on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but certainly joked.</v>

3184
02:29:25.080 --> 02:29:27.320
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Smacked around by a billionaire.</v>

3185
02:29:27.380 --> 02:29:32.380
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Good looking good looking guy with a </v>

3186
02:29:32.380 --> 02:29:32.380
<v Speaker 4>heart of gold.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Gold.</v>

3187
02:29:32.380 --> 02:29:32.380
<v Speaker 4>But it likes to spit in your mouth.</v>

3188
02:29:32.380 --> 02:29:33.290
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then she.</v>

3189
02:29:33.291 --> 02:29:38.291
<v Speaker 4>And then ultimately he'll see the light </v>
<v Speaker 4>and of course he'll be taking course.</v>

3190
02:29:39.050 --> 02:29:41.990
<v Speaker 4>That's fantasy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the fairy tale.</v>

3191
02:29:43.150 --> 02:29:44.680
<v Speaker 4>That's what everybody wants.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you.</v>

3192
02:29:44.681 --> 02:29:47.960
<v Speaker 4>That's why I was saying earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've got this idea,</v>

3193
02:29:47.961 --> 02:29:49.640
<v Speaker 4>I was talking to Duncan about this the </v>
<v Speaker 4>other night.</v>

3194
02:29:49.641 --> 02:29:52.340
<v Speaker 4>I've got this idea to write an erotic </v>
<v Speaker 4>memoir,</v>

3195
02:29:52.910 --> 02:29:57.910
<v Speaker 4>but that'll sort of be like my last book</v>
<v Speaker 4>because at that point I'll have burned </v>

3196
02:29:57.910 --> 02:30:01.490
<v Speaker 4>all the bridges.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'll be the only person who would ever</v>

3197
02:30:01.491 --> 02:30:06.491
<v Speaker 4>interviewed me after that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I was planning for it to come </v>

3198
02:30:06.491 --> 02:30:09.740
<v Speaker 4>out around my 60th birthday and it it'll</v>
<v Speaker 4>be called an old manifesto.</v>

3199
02:30:12.070 --> 02:30:14.900
<v Speaker 4>It just changed the names of people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh No.</v>

3200
02:30:14.901 --> 02:30:19.901
<v Speaker 4>I'm not worried about the people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not gonna hurt anybody in the bush </v>

3201
02:30:19.901 --> 02:30:19.980
<v Speaker 4>or it's more just about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3202
02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:21.740
<v Speaker 4>when people you fucked and people find </v>
<v Speaker 4>out the truth.</v>

3203
02:30:23.870 --> 02:30:25.010
<v Speaker 4>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're gonna become legendary.</v>

3204
02:30:25.560 --> 02:30:28.820
<v Speaker 4>But it's true though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's not a book about how much I got</v>

3205
02:30:28.821 --> 02:30:29.500
<v Speaker 4>laid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not.</v>

3206
02:30:29.610 --> 02:30:34.610
<v Speaker 4>It's not a book about how cool I am.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a book about the amazing things </v>

3207
02:30:34.911 --> 02:30:39.911
<v Speaker 4>I've learned in sexual situations and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that the world is so different from what</v>

3208
02:30:43.251 --> 02:30:45.470
<v Speaker 4>people think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How so?</v>

3209
02:30:47.540 --> 02:30:52.540
<v Speaker 4>There's just so many things going on </v>
<v Speaker 4>that mainstream people can't imagine.</v>

3210
02:30:53.450 --> 02:30:55.250
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3211
02:30:55.251 --> 02:31:00.251
<v Speaker 4>I was in college the first time a man </v>
<v Speaker 4>told me he would be happy for me to have</v>

3212
02:31:01.491 --> 02:31:06.230
<v Speaker 4>sex with his wife and it wasn't a Kinky,</v>
<v Speaker 4>weird thing.</v>

3213
02:31:06.231 --> 02:31:08.300
<v Speaker 4>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not doing it.</v>

3214
02:31:08.360 --> 02:31:11.660
<v Speaker 4>She's wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I noticed that you guys like each other.</v>

3215
02:31:12.080 --> 02:31:14.510
<v Speaker 4>I just want you to know it's cool with </v>
<v Speaker 4>me.</v>

3216
02:31:14.780 --> 02:31:18.200
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the first time since then there's</v>

3217
02:31:18.320 --> 02:31:19.890
<v Speaker 4>probably been,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

3218
02:31:19.920 --> 02:31:20.190
<v Speaker 4>half</v>

3219
02:31:20.190 --> 02:31:22.060
<v Speaker 5>a dozen or something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3220
02:31:22.290 --> 02:31:27.290
<v Speaker 5>mothers like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>would you please have sex with my </v>

3221
02:31:27.290 --> 02:31:27.290
<v Speaker 5>daughter?</v>
<v Speaker 5>She is,</v>

3222
02:31:27.290 --> 02:31:27.960
<v Speaker 5>she really,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3223
02:31:28.460 --> 02:31:33.460
<v Speaker 5>there is a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Generally it's because she didn't like </v>

3224
02:31:34.260 --> 02:31:36.150
<v Speaker 5>the boyfriend always.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3225
02:31:36.440 --> 02:31:36.990
<v Speaker 5>So I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

3226
02:31:36.991 --> 02:31:41.991
<v Speaker 5>you show my daughter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like there's a world out there that she </v>

3227
02:31:41.991 --> 02:31:41.991
<v Speaker 5>doesn't know about.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3228
02:31:41.991 --> 02:31:43.890
<v Speaker 5>there's always that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But then they recruit you and you got to</v>

3229
02:31:43.891 --> 02:31:45.650
<v Speaker 5>take on the project.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3230
02:31:46.230 --> 02:31:48.120
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>should you choose to accept it?</v>

3231
02:31:48.121 --> 02:31:50.580
<v Speaker 5>Should you choose to accept it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>They expect you to stick around as well.</v>

3232
02:31:51.060 --> 02:31:56.060
<v Speaker 5>Not necessarily just the world's weird </v>
<v Speaker 5>stuff that people think like,</v>

3233
02:31:57.210 --> 02:32:02.210
<v Speaker 5>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you know you have sex with someone's </v>

3234
02:32:02.210 --> 02:32:02.210
<v Speaker 5>wife and he knows he's going to kill </v>
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

3235
02:32:02.210 --> 02:32:06.141
<v Speaker 5>well maybe not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe it'll take you out for a beer </v>

3236
02:32:06.141 --> 02:32:08.001
<v Speaker 5>afterwards and you'll be friends.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is the subject of Arusha fears </v>

3237
02:32:08.001 --> 02:32:08.970
<v Speaker 5>podcast this week with our,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3238
02:32:08.971 --> 02:32:13.971
<v Speaker 5>with Aubrey Marcus and they're talking </v>
<v Speaker 5>about open relationships and they get </v>

3239
02:32:13.971 --> 02:32:14.040
<v Speaker 5>uber honest.</v>

3240
02:32:14.130 --> 02:32:19.130
<v Speaker 5>It's very intense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that we live and cultural </v>

3241
02:32:19.130 --> 02:32:22.500
<v Speaker 5>patterns and that what we see around us,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we replicate.</v>

3242
02:32:22.501 --> 02:32:24.090
<v Speaker 5>I think there's a lot of evidence for </v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

3243
02:32:24.091 --> 02:32:26.430
<v Speaker 5>If you just pay attention,</v>
<v Speaker 5>forget about studies,</v>

3244
02:32:26.580 --> 02:32:29.010
<v Speaker 5>just to look at how different people are</v>
<v Speaker 5>in other parts of the world.</v>

3245
02:32:29.011 --> 02:32:32.010
<v Speaker 5>People that are putting plates in their </v>
<v Speaker 5>lips and rings through their noses.</v>

3246
02:32:32.011 --> 02:32:34.470
<v Speaker 5>People that the way people tattoo </v>
<v Speaker 5>themselves,</v>

3247
02:32:34.471 --> 02:32:37.560
<v Speaker 5>the way people express themselves in </v>
<v Speaker 5>dance,</v>

3248
02:32:37.561 --> 02:32:42.561
<v Speaker 5>like human beings vary so wildly and </v>
<v Speaker 5>what we accept when we don't accept.</v>

3249
02:32:43.110 --> 02:32:48.110
<v Speaker 5>I was going to bring up Japan earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's one of the more fascinating travel </v>

3250
02:32:48.110 --> 02:32:52.040
<v Speaker 5>experiences I've had was going to Japan </v>
<v Speaker 5>because when you go to Tokyo you realize</v>

3251
02:32:52.041 --> 02:32:54.750
<v Speaker 5>like this is a completely different way </v>
<v Speaker 5>of living.</v>

3252
02:32:55.250 --> 02:32:58.320
<v Speaker 5>Like they have a completely different </v>
<v Speaker 5>way of interacting on the streets.</v>

3253
02:32:58.650 --> 02:33:02.100
<v Speaker 5>They have a completely different way </v>
<v Speaker 5>that they have decorated their buildings</v>

3254
02:33:02.130 --> 02:33:02.600
<v Speaker 5>completely.</v>

3255
02:33:02.740 --> 02:33:07.740
<v Speaker 5>Like I have tattoos.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They told me I had to wear long sleeves </v>

3256
02:33:07.740 --> 02:33:08.280
<v Speaker 5>at the gym.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had to go back and change my shirt.</v>

3257
02:33:08.880 --> 02:33:12.480
<v Speaker 5>They don't accept expose tattoo </v>
<v Speaker 5>associated with organized crime,</v>

3258
02:33:12.950 --> 02:33:17.950
<v Speaker 5>so I had to go back and just.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of that like where you </v>

3259
02:33:17.950 --> 02:33:20.040
<v Speaker 5>realize like this is a totally different</v>
<v Speaker 5>way of living,</v>

3260
02:33:20.041 --> 02:33:22.140
<v Speaker 5>but if I lived there I would live like </v>
<v Speaker 5>these people.</v>

3261
02:33:22.290 --> 02:33:27.290
<v Speaker 5>So the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The momentum of these patterns in these </v>

3262
02:33:27.290 --> 02:33:30.501
<v Speaker 5>cultures gets established and then it </v>
<v Speaker 5>takes something radical to lift them and</v>

3263
02:33:31.711 --> 02:33:34.800
<v Speaker 5>to free people from these patterns and </v>
<v Speaker 5>once they're free from these patterns,</v>

3264
02:33:34.980 --> 02:33:39.980
<v Speaker 5>then they have a real opportunity to </v>
<v Speaker 5>objectively assess the way they behave </v>

3265
02:33:40.020 --> 02:33:45.020
<v Speaker 5>and whether or not this is the way they </v>
<v Speaker 5>want to behave or the way they want to </v>

3266
02:33:45.020 --> 02:33:47.490
<v Speaker 5>live or whether that just expect it to </v>
<v Speaker 5>because of this unthinking culture.</v>

3267
02:33:47.880 --> 02:33:50.480
<v Speaker 5>Momentum.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Think that's what podcasts is doing.</v>

3268
02:33:50.680 --> 02:33:51.220
<v Speaker 5>The,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

3269
02:33:51.290 --> 02:33:54.810
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the big thing with podcasts is that it's</v>

3270
02:33:54.811 --> 02:33:59.811
<v Speaker 5>creating more narratives and it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>creating more discussions about </v>

3271
02:34:00.270 --> 02:34:05.270
<v Speaker 5>interesting subjects and more questions </v>
<v Speaker 5>and discussions about like why we live </v>

3272
02:34:06.361 --> 02:34:11.361
<v Speaker 5>our life a certain way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And if you live a regular life with </v>

3273
02:34:11.361 --> 02:34:14.631
<v Speaker 5>regular people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what are the odds that you get a chance </v>

3274
02:34:14.631 --> 02:34:16.860
<v Speaker 5>to sit down with a guy like you for </v>
<v Speaker 5>three hours or a guy like Graham Hancock</v>

3275
02:34:16.861 --> 02:34:17.980
<v Speaker 5>or go like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3276
02:34:17.981 --> 02:34:18.820
<v Speaker 5>fill in the blank.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3277
02:34:18.821 --> 02:34:23.821
<v Speaker 5>the fascinating people that you are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have talked to in our podcasts and </v>

3278
02:34:23.821 --> 02:34:26.770
<v Speaker 5>then do these conversations get right in</v>
<v Speaker 5>someone's head.</v>

3279
02:34:26.930 --> 02:34:31.930
<v Speaker 5>Whether their earbuds on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whether at work typing some nonsense </v>

3280
02:34:31.930 --> 02:34:35.110
<v Speaker 5>bullshit into some fucking forms they </v>
<v Speaker 5>have to fill out because that's what </v>

3281
02:34:35.110 --> 02:34:36.970
<v Speaker 5>they do for a living.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what's different and that's never</v>

3282
02:34:36.971 --> 02:34:40.600
<v Speaker 5>happened before.</v>
<v Speaker 5>These I like no generation before.</v>

3283
02:34:40.600 --> 02:34:44.080
<v Speaker 5>The podcast generation had that option.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You had Howard Stern,</v>

3284
02:34:44.290 --> 02:34:48.330
<v Speaker 5>you had and it was always funny.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You had art.</v>

3285
02:34:48.340 --> 02:34:53.340
<v Speaker 5>Bell was always weird and then you had </v>
<v Speaker 5>all the right wing Wacko dudes on am </v>

<v Speaker 5>you had all those people but you didn't.</v>

3288

<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You didn't have a guy who just talks </v>

3289
02:35:05.110 --> 02:35:05.140
<v Speaker 5>about whatever he wants to talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You had to be like,</v>

3295
02:35:18.700 --> 02:35:18.700
<v Speaker 5>and about how I think monogamy is just </v>
<v Speaker 5>a.</v>

3296
02:35:18.700 --> 02:35:21.370
<v Speaker 5>it's just a cultural construct and </v>
<v Speaker 5>really the way we evolved like,</v>

3297
02:35:21.380 --> 02:35:21.870
<v Speaker 5>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whoa,</v>

<v Speaker 5>like before you came to someone and </v>

3301
02:35:31.361 --> 02:35:31.990
<v Speaker 5>said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

3303
02:35:35.291 --> 02:35:37.360
<v Speaker 5>copies and it's basically same.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Monogamy is bullshit.</v>

3304

<v Speaker 5>have a picket fence and live in the same</v>

3307
02:35:46.480 --> 02:35:48.730

<v Speaker 5>Oh you have an in ground pool.</v>

3309
02:35:50.591 --> 02:35:53.250
<v Speaker 5>You lucky bastard.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know the,</v>

3310
02:35:53.251 --> 02:35:58.251
<v Speaker 5>what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what podcasts have done is expose why we</v>

3311
02:35:59.380 --> 02:36:04.380
<v Speaker 5>accept things as fact and why we just </v>
<v Speaker 5>chew it because everybody around us does</v>

3312
02:36:04.991 --> 02:36:09.991
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We are such a massive product of our </v>

3313
02:36:09.991 --> 02:36:09.991
<v Speaker 5>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3314
02:36:09.991 --> 02:36:14.251
<v Speaker 5>and I think when we were talking earlier</v>
<v Speaker 5>about race and about race being a </v>

3315
02:36:15.221 --> 02:36:19.540
<v Speaker 5>determining factor for ICU,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like you don't really ever know.</v>

3316
02:36:19.750 --> 02:36:24.750
<v Speaker 5>You might know from studies,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you don't know until those people </v>

3317
02:36:24.750 --> 02:36:28.290
<v Speaker 5>who have the high Iq have to live the </v>
<v Speaker 5>lives of the people that had the low Iq </v>

3318
02:36:28.390 --> 02:36:31.330
<v Speaker 5>and they have to have the same </v>
<v Speaker 5>environment that they grow up.</v>

3319
02:36:31.340 --> 02:36:33.980
<v Speaker 5>And the same fears and the same </v>
<v Speaker 5>influences,</v>

3320
02:36:34.000 --> 02:36:35.950
<v Speaker 5>negative and positive,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then you'll know.</v>

3321
02:36:36.100 --> 02:36:41.100
<v Speaker 5>And even then you won't know because </v>
<v Speaker 5>there's so many determining factors </v>

3322
02:36:41.100 --> 02:36:41.100
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3323
02:36:41.100 --> 02:36:43.930
<v Speaker 5>I know people that are just way fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>smarter than me.</v>

3324
02:36:44.110 --> 02:36:46.240
<v Speaker 5>They're just smarter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just know they are.</v>

3325
02:36:46.570 --> 02:36:48.730
<v Speaker 5>They're just smarter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What is that?</v>

3326
02:36:48.760 --> 02:36:53.760
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is it the amount of studying they've </v>

3327
02:36:53.760 --> 02:36:54.250
<v Speaker 5>done?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is it the amount of knowledge they have?</v>

3328
02:36:54.251 --> 02:36:56.980
<v Speaker 5>Is that the path that they're on is </v>
<v Speaker 5>different than my path?</v>

3329
02:36:57.130 --> 02:36:59.050
<v Speaker 5>Or is it just their fucking brain works </v>
<v Speaker 5>better?</v>

3330
02:36:59.360 --> 02:37:02.360
<v Speaker 4>But also what do we mean by smarter?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3331
02:37:02.361 --> 02:37:04.570
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I look at someone like you.</v>

3332
02:37:04.870 --> 02:37:09.050
<v Speaker 4>Your discipline is a major factor in </v>
<v Speaker 4>your success.</v>

3333
02:37:09.650 --> 02:37:14.650
<v Speaker 4>So is that part of being smart?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's smart enough to understand the </v>

3334
02:37:14.650 --> 02:37:15.710
<v Speaker 4>discipline as a worthwhile pursuit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what it is.</v>

3335
02:37:15.711 --> 02:37:16.010
<v Speaker 4>So what</v>

3336
02:37:16.010 --> 02:37:19.370
<v Speaker 3>about someone who has a really high Iq </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's sitting in a basement eating lots</v>

3337
02:37:19.371 --> 02:37:22.400
<v Speaker 3>of ice cream and not doing what they </v>
<v Speaker 3>want to do?</v>

3338
02:37:22.450 --> 02:37:24.350
<v Speaker 3>That's not smart decision making for </v>
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>

3339
02:37:24.380 --> 02:37:25.970
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's very high Iq,</v>

3340
02:37:26.020 --> 02:37:28.740
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what do we mean for a hunter gatherer</v>

3341
02:37:28.741 --> 02:37:32.720
<v Speaker 3>of these people in the Amazon?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're talking about who can identify 500</v>

3342
02:37:32.721 --> 02:37:36.840
<v Speaker 3>different kinds of plants at a glance </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

3343
02:37:36.920 --> 02:37:39.050
<v Speaker 3>the behavior of animals and all this </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff,</v>

3344
02:37:39.230 --> 02:37:42.590
<v Speaker 3>but you give them an Iq test and they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>like under 100 for sure.</v>

3345
02:37:42.650 --> 02:37:47.650
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've had conversations with people that </v>

3346
02:37:47.650 --> 02:37:49.511
<v Speaker 3>are brilliant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>super brilliant people and science and </v>

3347
02:37:49.511 --> 02:37:52.631
<v Speaker 3>they'll try to explain to me mixed </v>
<v Speaker 3>martial arts and some fucked up </v>

3348
02:37:52.631 --> 02:37:53.030
<v Speaker 3>cockamamie Wayne.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have to stop them.</v>

3349
02:37:53.930 --> 02:37:54.650
<v Speaker 3>Stop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3350
02:37:54.651 --> 02:37:59.570
<v Speaker 3>Right now you sound like a fucking moron</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I know you're not a professor,</v>

3351
02:37:59.600 --> 02:38:02.290
<v Speaker 3>but you're talking about something that </v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a PhD,</v>

3352
02:38:02.960 --> 02:38:04.970
<v Speaker 3>I have a phd and people fucking people </v>
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>

3353
02:38:04.970 --> 02:38:06.920
<v Speaker 3>I understand it as good as anybody </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's ever lived.</v>

3354
02:38:06.921 --> 02:38:10.340
<v Speaker 3>So if you start talking nonsense about </v>
<v Speaker 3>how to fuck people up,</v>

3355
02:38:10.520 --> 02:38:12.350
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your Kung Fu instructor said that,</v>

3356
02:38:12.690 --> 02:38:17.690
<v Speaker 3>oh fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like Aikido.</v>

3357
02:38:18.260 --> 02:38:20.300
<v Speaker 3>But I recognize that there's a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>bullshit.</v>

3358
02:38:20.330 --> 02:38:21.920
<v Speaker 3>There's a funding to practice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3359
02:38:21.921 --> 02:38:25.100
<v Speaker 3>it's fun to be able to flip people </v>
<v Speaker 3>around like that and it would be a great</v>

3360
02:38:25.101 --> 02:38:30.101
<v Speaker 3>thing to know if you lived in feudal </v>
<v Speaker 3>Japan and you lost your sword and </v>

3361
02:38:30.101 --> 02:38:32.270
<v Speaker 3>someone was coming at you when you had </v>
<v Speaker 3>one chance at glory.</v>

3362
02:38:32.840 --> 02:38:37.840
<v Speaker 3>What I love about Aikido is how it </v>
<v Speaker 3>translates into psychological and </v>

3363
02:38:37.840 --> 02:38:39.500
<v Speaker 3>emotional stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what we were saying earlier about how</v>

3364
02:38:39.501 --> 02:38:42.980
<v Speaker 3>I don't engage with people who are </v>
<v Speaker 3>emotionally triggered by sex at dawn.</v>

3365
02:38:43.160 --> 02:38:44.300
<v Speaker 3>To me that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3366
02:38:44.330 --> 02:38:45.090
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

3367
02:38:45.330 --> 02:38:50.330
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I learned that kind of thing for my </v>

3368
02:38:50.330 --> 02:38:50.330
<v Speaker 3>Quito.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>

3369
02:38:50.330 --> 02:38:50.330
<v Speaker 3>you don't need to engage.</v>

3370
02:38:50.330 --> 02:38:51.140
<v Speaker 3>Secondly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you do engage,</v>

3371
02:38:51.170 --> 02:38:55.820
<v Speaker 3>what's important is that you stay calm </v>
<v Speaker 3>and centered and most of the time people</v>

3372
02:38:55.821 --> 02:38:58.370
<v Speaker 3>burn themselves out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't even really need to.</v>

3373
02:38:58.730 --> 02:39:02.420
<v Speaker 3>As long as you step out of the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let people have what they need to have.</v>

3374
02:39:02.440 --> 02:39:03.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>

3375
02:39:03.770 --> 02:39:04.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

3376
02:39:04.671 --> 02:39:07.780
<v Speaker 3>as far as the fighting technique,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not what you're going to pull up in</v>

3377
02:39:07.781 --> 02:39:08.840
<v Speaker 3>the street.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>

3378
02:39:08.841 --> 02:39:13.841
<v Speaker 3>but it's just my point is that people </v>
<v Speaker 3>who are brilliant and are geniuses in </v>

3379
02:39:13.841 --> 02:39:18.371
<v Speaker 3>one aspect of life simply don't have </v>
<v Speaker 3>enough time to accumulate the same </v>

3380
02:39:18.371 --> 02:39:19.940
<v Speaker 3>amount of data about everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just don't sure whether it's,</v>

3381
02:39:19.941 --> 02:39:20.960
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>

3382
02:39:21.800 --> 02:39:26.800
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fill in the blank clock making or </v>

3383
02:39:26.800 --> 02:39:26.800
<v Speaker 3>whatever the fuck it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's just like,</v>

3384
02:39:26.800 --> 02:39:26.850
<v Speaker 3>there's things that people know that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

3385
02:39:26.930 --> 02:39:29.300
<v Speaker 3>you don't know and it doesn't make you </v>
<v Speaker 3>stupid.</v>

3386
02:39:29.301 --> 02:39:34.301
<v Speaker 3>It's just information.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The differences between how you apply </v>

3387
02:39:34.301 --> 02:39:34.301
<v Speaker 3>that information.</v>

3388
02:39:34.301 --> 02:39:35.750
<v Speaker 3>Like if you're a really smart person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't do shit with it,</v>

3389
02:39:35.780 --> 02:39:39.140
<v Speaker 3>you're a moron.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You might be a really genius person,</v>

3390
02:39:39.141 --> 02:39:44.141
<v Speaker 3>but if your life is falling apart and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all because of your shitty </v>

3391
02:39:44.141 --> 02:39:46.841
<v Speaker 3>decisions and you've never tried to </v>
<v Speaker 3>improve upon your thought process and </v>

3392
02:39:46.841 --> 02:39:48.140
<v Speaker 3>just blame the whole world instead of </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself,</v>

3393
02:39:48.141 --> 02:39:53.141
<v Speaker 3>you're a moron.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even if you're really good at taking Iq </v>

3394
02:39:53.141 --> 02:39:53.141
<v Speaker 3>tests.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

3395
02:39:53.141 --> 02:39:54.500
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't personally,</v>

3396
02:39:54.501 --> 02:39:58.250
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that I'm particularly </v>
<v Speaker 3>intelligent.</v>

3397
02:39:58.460 --> 02:40:03.460
<v Speaker 3>I think that what I can do that a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>people don't do is think outside the box</v>

3398
02:40:04.720 --> 02:40:07.130
<v Speaker 3>and connect dots that other people </v>
<v Speaker 3>aren't connecting,</v>

3399
02:40:07.430 --> 02:40:12.430
<v Speaker 3>which is precisely because I didn't go </v>
<v Speaker 3>to the right schools and I,</v>

3400
02:40:13.440 --> 02:40:14.010
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3401
02:40:14.400 --> 02:40:17.190
<v Speaker 4>in my twenties I went and fucked around </v>
<v Speaker 4>the world for 20 years.</v>

3402
02:40:17.520 --> 02:40:22.520
<v Speaker 6>You don't have tenure that you're </v>
<v Speaker 6>working for or anything that's going to </v>

3403
02:40:22.520 --> 02:40:27.200
<v Speaker 6>keep you in,</v>
<v Speaker 6>lie around and figure it out and I mean </v>

3404
02:40:27.200 --> 02:40:27.330
<v Speaker 6>that's the people that get stuck in </v>
<v Speaker 6>that.</v>

3405
02:40:27.440 --> 02:40:30.900
<v Speaker 6>Even intellectuals,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they get stuck in that trap of having to</v>

3406
02:40:30.901 --> 02:40:33.890
<v Speaker 6>toe the line in terms of like.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

3407
02:40:33.960 --> 02:40:36.690
<v Speaker 6>good luck trying to find a conservative </v>
<v Speaker 6>professor.</v>

3408
02:40:36.870 --> 02:40:41.870
<v Speaker 6>Wright W,</v>
<v Speaker 6>four percent identify as conservatives </v>

3409
02:40:41.870 --> 02:40:46.150
<v Speaker 6>in mainstream universities and colleges </v>
<v Speaker 6>have some really ridiculously low </v>

3410
02:40:46.150 --> 02:40:47.250
<v Speaker 6>number,</v>
<v Speaker 6>might be 10 percent,</v>

3411
02:40:47.251 --> 02:40:50.310
<v Speaker 6>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's the vast minority.</v>

3412
02:40:51.080 --> 02:40:51.660
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if one,</v>

3413
02:40:51.690 --> 02:40:53.340
<v Speaker 6>if you get one out a 10,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're super lucky.</v>

3414
02:40:53.400 --> 02:40:53.810
<v Speaker 6>I think that's</v>

3415
02:40:55.050 --> 02:40:57.350
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what do we mean by conservative?</v>

3416
02:40:58.220 --> 02:41:00.320
<v Speaker 4>It's so confusing because the older I </v>
<v Speaker 4>get,</v>

3417
02:41:00.321 --> 02:41:05.321
<v Speaker 4>the more I realized that the language.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like one of those venn diagrams </v>

3418
02:41:06.621 --> 02:41:09.650
<v Speaker 4>where there's language and there's </v>
<v Speaker 4>reality and there's some overlap,</v>

3419
02:41:09.651 --> 02:41:11.840
<v Speaker 4>but there's a lot that doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>correspond,</v>

3420
02:41:12.600 --> 02:41:17.600
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get into this a lot when people are </v>

3421
02:41:17.600 --> 02:41:17.600
<v Speaker 4>talking about homosexuality and whether </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

3422
02:41:17.600 --> 02:41:21.590
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>human nature or its culture or whatever,</v>

3423
02:41:21.591 --> 02:41:22.580
<v Speaker 4>and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>

3424
02:41:22.730 --> 02:41:25.610
<v Speaker 4>what do we mean by homosexuality?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

3425
02:41:25.640 --> 02:41:26.960
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I've talked about this before,</v>

3426
02:41:26.961 --> 02:41:31.961
<v Speaker 4>this tribe in Papa New Guinea where the </v>
<v Speaker 4>boys suck as much dick as they can </v>

3427
02:41:31.961 --> 02:41:34.910
<v Speaker 4>because they think that semen contains </v>
<v Speaker 4>the essence of masculinity.</v>

3428
02:41:35.300 --> 02:41:39.020
<v Speaker 4>And so it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to them that's not homosexual behavior,</v>

3429
02:41:39.021 --> 02:41:43.220
<v Speaker 4>that's normal male developmental </v>
<v Speaker 4>behavior and you know,</v>

3430
02:41:43.221 --> 02:41:44.330
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we look at that and say,</v>

3431
02:41:44.331 --> 02:41:47.840
<v Speaker 4>oh well that's gay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they don't see it as gay.</v>

3432
02:41:47.841 --> 02:41:48.620
<v Speaker 4>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

3433
02:41:48.920 --> 02:41:51.610
<v Speaker 4>as you were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we replicate the behavior we see around</v>

3434
02:41:51.840 --> 02:41:56.170
<v Speaker 6>they have adult homosexuality or do they</v>
<v Speaker 6>only have sex with kids?</v>

3435
02:41:57.270 --> 02:42:02.270
<v Speaker 4>I think it's only at least the only kind</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's been reported by anthropologists </v>

3436
02:42:02.270 --> 02:42:03.600
<v Speaker 4>because again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a filtering there,</v>

3437
02:42:03.810 --> 02:42:08.810
<v Speaker 4>of course is younger boys with older </v>
<v Speaker 4>boys.</v>

3438
02:42:09.360 --> 02:42:14.360
<v Speaker 4>So it's the younger boys are given blow </v>
<v Speaker 4>jobs to the older boys because that's </v>

3439
02:42:14.671 --> 02:42:18.190
<v Speaker 4>the way to get stronger and more </v>
<v Speaker 4>masculine scam.</v>

3440
02:42:18.190 --> 02:42:23.190
<v Speaker 6>Somebody pulled off one.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We have got no way of doing things with </v>

3441
02:42:29.520 --> 02:42:34.520
<v Speaker 6>my Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He pulls the grass skirt aside.</v>

3442
02:42:34.950 --> 02:42:36.290
<v Speaker 6>Oh Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Here we go.</v>

3443
02:42:36.450 --> 02:42:39.610
<v Speaker 6>Here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3444
02:42:40.540 --> 02:42:42.740
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's drums sucking.</v>

3445
02:42:42.741 --> 02:42:43.620
<v Speaker 6>Dicks pump,</v>
<v Speaker 6>pump,</v>

3446
02:42:43.670 --> 02:42:44.180
<v Speaker 6>pump,</v>
<v Speaker 6>pump,</v>

3447
02:42:44.210 --> 02:42:44.790
<v Speaker 6>pump,</v>
<v Speaker 6>pump,</v>

3448
02:42:44.810 --> 02:42:45.270
<v Speaker 6>pump,</v>
<v Speaker 6>pump.</v>

3449
02:42:46.190 --> 02:42:48.120
<v Speaker 6>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's pretty crazy though.</v>

3450
02:42:48.121 --> 02:42:53.121
<v Speaker 6>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like what we were saying earlier that </v>

3451
02:42:53.121 --> 02:42:55.041
<v Speaker 6>you can have these pockets of culture </v>
<v Speaker 6>that they're radically different than </v>

3452
02:42:55.041 --> 02:42:58.350
<v Speaker 6>other places,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but the people just adapt and conform to</v>

3453
02:42:58.351 --> 02:43:03.351
<v Speaker 6>what's around them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I think that's the case with human </v>

3454
02:43:03.351 --> 02:43:06.141
<v Speaker 6>beings everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't think it's just the people that </v>

3455
02:43:06.141 --> 02:43:07.110
<v Speaker 6>live in New Guinea and it's not just the</v>
<v Speaker 6>people that live in the Congo or live in</v>

3456
02:43:07.140 --> 02:43:09.270
<v Speaker 6>woodland hills.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's people that live everywhere.</v>

3457
02:43:09.390 --> 02:43:12.100
<v Speaker 6>It's just how human beings behave.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And it's also</v>

3458
02:43:12.100 --> 02:43:15.550
<v Speaker 4>interesting to look at how the culture </v>
<v Speaker 4>reflects the environment.</v>

3459
02:43:15.610 --> 02:43:16.320
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3460
02:43:16.340 --> 02:43:18.940
<v Speaker 4>And Marvin Harris wrote about this </v>
<v Speaker 4>cultural materialism,</v>

3461
02:43:18.941 --> 02:43:23.941
<v Speaker 4>how,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how a culture responds to an </v>

3462
02:43:23.941 --> 02:43:23.941
<v Speaker 4>environment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of like how,</v>

3463
02:43:23.941 --> 02:43:26.680
<v Speaker 4>you know Cacti live in the desert.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a reason for that.</v>

3464
02:43:26.681 --> 02:43:28.870
<v Speaker 4>You put a cactus in the jungle that dies</v>
<v Speaker 4>immediately,</v>

3465
02:43:28.871 --> 02:43:31.180
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's adapted to an environment.</v>

3466
02:43:31.181 --> 02:43:33.300
<v Speaker 4>So you've got desert cultures,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3467
02:43:33.610 --> 02:43:38.610
<v Speaker 4>You've got jungle cultures,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so the culture actually grows in a way </v>

3468
02:43:38.771 --> 02:43:42.080
<v Speaker 4>that fits that ecological environment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>

3469
02:43:42.190 --> 02:43:47.190
<v Speaker 4>he was the first.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he's the first person to figure </v>

3470
02:43:47.190 --> 02:43:47.190
<v Speaker 4>this out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Certainly the first time I read it,</v>

3471
02:43:47.190 --> 02:43:51.930
<v Speaker 4>like some island,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some cultures are cannibalistic and </v>

3472
02:43:51.930 --> 02:43:51.930
<v Speaker 4>others aren't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3473
02:43:51.930 --> 02:43:52.750
<v Speaker 4>Why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

3474
02:43:52.751 --> 02:43:57.751
<v Speaker 4>I'd never thought about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like why would the aztecs eat the,</v>

3475
02:43:57.970 --> 02:44:00.070
<v Speaker 4>their victims,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the Christians didn't,</v>

3476
02:44:00.071 --> 02:44:03.160
<v Speaker 4>but the Christians killed a lot more.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They just left them to rot on the field.</v>

3477
02:44:03.430 --> 02:44:06.280
<v Speaker 4>Why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that the Aztecs are particularly evil</v>

3478
02:44:06.281 --> 02:44:07.180
<v Speaker 4>or something?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

3479
02:44:07.810 --> 02:44:12.810
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he applied this prism to it and show </v>

3480
02:44:12.810 --> 02:44:15.100
<v Speaker 4>that also in the South Pacific,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there are some islands that were,</v>

3481
02:44:15.140 --> 02:44:17.590
<v Speaker 4>the people are cannibalistic and other </v>
<v Speaker 4>islands where they weren't.</v>

3482
02:44:17.820 --> 02:44:20.710
<v Speaker 4>And so he looks at all these in when he </v>
<v Speaker 4>figured out was that in the places where</v>

3483
02:44:20.711 --> 02:44:25.711
<v Speaker 4>people are cannibalistic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there are no domesticated animals that </v>

3484
02:44:28.600 --> 02:44:31.780
<v Speaker 4>eat different food than humans.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So for example,</v>

3485
02:44:31.781 --> 02:44:35.020
<v Speaker 4>you can't raise dogs for me because dogs</v>
<v Speaker 4>eat what we eat,</v>

3486
02:44:35.650 --> 02:44:40.650
<v Speaker 4>so it doesn't make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you can raise goats because goats </v>

3487
02:44:40.650 --> 02:44:40.650
<v Speaker 4>eat shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Humans don't eat right.</v>

3488
02:44:40.650 --> 02:44:45.510
<v Speaker 4>So in the places that are cannibalistic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was no nothing they could </v>

3489
02:44:45.581 --> 02:44:50.581
<v Speaker 4>domesticate for protein.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when he killed a human yatim because </v>

3490
02:44:50.591 --> 02:44:53.890
<v Speaker 4>your protein starved.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

3491
02:44:54.040 --> 02:44:56.950
<v Speaker 4>Isn't that crazy?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's an ecological thing.</v>

3492
02:44:56.980 --> 02:45:00.430
<v Speaker 4>The aztecs had no pigs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3493
02:45:00.431 --> 02:45:02.110
<v Speaker 4>There was nothing they could </v>
<v Speaker 4>domesticate.</v>

3494
02:45:02.111 --> 02:45:04.300
<v Speaker 4>No cattle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They had turkeys,</v>

3495
02:45:04.301 --> 02:45:07.750
<v Speaker 4>I think was the only time they had met </v>
<v Speaker 4>from a person they killed.</v>

3496
02:45:07.751 --> 02:45:10.090
<v Speaker 4>There were so psyched to not just going </v>
<v Speaker 4>to let it go.</v>

3497
02:45:11.640 --> 02:45:11.960
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3498
02:45:12.180 --> 02:45:13.650
<v Speaker 5>They ever tell you that's the case with </v>
<v Speaker 5>bears.</v>

3499
02:45:14.370 --> 02:45:18.220
<v Speaker 5>The bears are all cannibals.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cannibals.</v>

3500
02:45:18.390 --> 02:45:22.290
<v Speaker 5>It's really dark.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My friend Jonathan saw a bore,</v>

3501
02:45:22.350 --> 02:45:26.040
<v Speaker 5>a male bear kill a cub and then saw the </v>
<v Speaker 5>female eat it.</v>

3502
02:45:26.370 --> 02:45:27.300
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the female,</v>

3503
02:45:27.600 --> 02:45:31.500
<v Speaker 5>the female chase the male way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And after he'd killed that,</v>

3504
02:45:31.501 --> 02:45:34.140
<v Speaker 5>she was trying to eat it and she chased </v>
<v Speaker 5>him away and then she ate it.</v>

3505
02:45:34.450 --> 02:45:39.450
<v Speaker 5>Shader own cub.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he said he had heard that they did </v>

3506
02:45:39.450 --> 02:45:40.920
<v Speaker 5>that before.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But watching that in person.</v>

3507
02:45:41.340 --> 02:45:42.180
<v Speaker 5>But they're all cannibal,</v>

3508
02:45:42.270 --> 02:45:42.990
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>lots of,</v>

3509
02:45:43.020 --> 02:45:46.230
<v Speaker 4>lots of mammal mothers will eat their </v>
<v Speaker 4>young.</v>

3510
02:45:46.530 --> 02:45:49.590
<v Speaker 5>But these guys come out of the den </v>
<v Speaker 5>looking for cubs.</v>

3511
02:45:50.050 --> 02:45:52.010
<v Speaker 5>The,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the spring bears,</v>

3512
02:45:52.400 --> 02:45:53.940
<v Speaker 5>they do it for two reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They do it.</v>

3513
02:45:53.941 --> 02:45:54.690
<v Speaker 5>One,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

3514
02:45:54.750 --> 02:45:59.750
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they know now that it's not just to try </v>

3515
02:45:59.750 --> 02:45:59.750
<v Speaker 5>to force the female and the Astros </v>
<v Speaker 5>again,</v>

3516
02:45:59.880 --> 02:46:03.390
<v Speaker 5>they used to think it was just that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But now they like if you shoot a bear,</v>

3517
02:46:03.750 --> 02:46:08.750
<v Speaker 5>other bears will claim it as their since</v>
<v Speaker 5>start eating it and you have to chase </v>

3518
02:46:08.750 --> 02:46:08.880
<v Speaker 5>them off.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like they're,</v>

3519
02:46:09.450 --> 02:46:14.450
<v Speaker 5>it's the world of a bear is so fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>hard scrabble and so fraught with peril </v>

3520
02:46:16.611 --> 02:46:18.260
<v Speaker 5>and they have to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3521
02:46:18.310 --> 02:46:21.210
<v Speaker 5>you're talking about a 500 pound bear.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How much do you have to eat every day?</v>

3522
02:46:21.800 --> 02:46:26.800
<v Speaker 5>What do you have?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you like 30 pounds of meat or </v>

3523
02:46:26.800 --> 02:46:27.680
<v Speaker 5>something like moths and everything?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Their machines,</v>

3524
02:46:27.860 --> 02:46:31.100
<v Speaker 5>where they are is they clean the forest </v>
<v Speaker 5>up of babies.</v>

3525
02:46:31.101 --> 02:46:36.101
<v Speaker 5>They can't get away and any.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's no overpopulating when there's </v>

3526
02:46:36.101 --> 02:46:36.940
<v Speaker 5>hikers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3527
02:46:36.980 --> 02:46:39.140
<v Speaker 5>Well they.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh that's so rare.</v>

3528
02:46:39.350 --> 02:46:42.380
<v Speaker 5>It's so rare and it's more black bears </v>
<v Speaker 5>in his brown bears.</v>

3529
02:46:42.680 --> 02:46:47.680
<v Speaker 5>When Brown bears kill people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's usually because someone fucked up </v>

3530
02:46:47.680 --> 02:46:51.161
<v Speaker 5>and came across a female with her babies</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the females want to take any </v>

3531
02:46:51.161 --> 02:46:51.260
<v Speaker 5>chances.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She fucks you up.</v>

3532
02:46:51.680 --> 02:46:54.590
<v Speaker 5>But when a blackberry too,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's more likely for predation.</v>

3533
02:46:55.030 --> 02:46:59.320
<v Speaker 2>Also a black barrel chased up a tree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A grizzly won't climb a tree.</v>

3534
02:46:59.420 --> 02:47:00.230
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's true.</v>

3535
02:47:00.231 --> 02:47:02.960
<v Speaker 5>And a lot of times when the black bears </v>
<v Speaker 5>are near people,</v>

3536
02:47:03.050 --> 02:47:06.560
<v Speaker 5>the reason is because people have </v>
<v Speaker 5>encroached on their their areas and then</v>

3537
02:47:06.561 --> 02:47:11.561
<v Speaker 5>they started getting into eating garbage</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they start getting into eating </v>

3538
02:47:11.561 --> 02:47:14.771
<v Speaker 5>garbage.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They become a real problem because </v>

3539
02:47:14.771 --> 02:47:14.771
<v Speaker 5>they're smart and they realize like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>

3540
02:47:14.771 --> 02:47:15.920
<v Speaker 5>fucking chase after some deer when I </v>
<v Speaker 5>could eat this dude's trash.</v>

3541
02:47:16.300 --> 02:47:18.320
<v Speaker 5>And then how much does he does dude?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like they don't.</v>

3542
02:47:18.350 --> 02:47:20.420
<v Speaker 5>They don't think about the problems with</v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

3543
02:47:20.660 --> 02:47:23.060
<v Speaker 5>This is going to bring heat on the Klan,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3544
02:47:23.061 --> 02:47:24.630
<v Speaker 5>they just fuck that person up.</v>

3545
02:47:24.770 --> 02:47:27.170
<v Speaker 2>I spent a lot of time thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>bears in Alaska.</v>

3546
02:47:27.260 --> 02:47:28.490
<v Speaker 2>You should.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3547
02:47:28.491 --> 02:47:31.220
<v Speaker 2>I was working the first year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so stupid.</v>

3548
02:47:31.550 --> 02:47:35.450
<v Speaker 2>I worked in this cannery in Kenai for </v>
<v Speaker 2>like six weeks.</v>

3549
02:47:35.460 --> 02:47:36.560
<v Speaker 2>Salmon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Salmon.</v>

<v Speaker 2>seven days a week,</v>

3552
02:47:40.761 --> 02:47:45.761
<v Speaker 2>just like full on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking busting it out because the fish </v>

3553
02:47:45.761 --> 02:47:46.640
<v Speaker 2>are coming in and they got the lines </v>
<v Speaker 2>around it and you know,</v>

3554
02:47:46.940 --> 02:47:51.940
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and at night I would go back and sleep </v>

3555
02:47:51.940 --> 02:47:52.760
<v Speaker 2>in my tent on this bluff where we were </v>
<v Speaker 2>all camped out.</v>

3556
02:47:52.761 --> 02:47:54.330
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3557
02:47:54.800 --> 02:47:59.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after six weeks everything smelled like </v>

<v Speaker 2>when I was with these two other dudes </v>

<v Speaker 3>bigfoot.</v>

3600
02:49:34.830 --> 02:49:39.830

3660
02:52:06.580 --> 02:52:11.580
<v Speaker 3>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he's hesitant to do it and I </v>

3661
02:52:11.580 --> 02:52:11.580
<v Speaker 3>understand why he works for a big </v>
<v Speaker 3>hospital and you know,</v>

3662
02:52:11.700 --> 02:52:16.700
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't want to become a rock star,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we ended up hanging out in his </v>

3663
02:52:16.700 --> 02:52:19.651
<v Speaker 3>office talking about this dude gave </v>
<v Speaker 3>himself have a sec dummy.</v>

3664
02:52:21.160 --> 02:52:22.210
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's.</v>

3665
02:52:22.270 --> 02:52:23.020
<v Speaker 3>He told me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>

3666
02:52:23.021 --> 02:52:24.430
<v Speaker 3>that's how bad he didn't want to have </v>
<v Speaker 3>kids.</v>

3667
02:52:26.460 --> 02:52:29.890
<v Speaker 3>He pried his dick hole open delay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was just like,</v>

3668
02:52:30.220 --> 02:52:31.330
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do it,</v>

3669
02:52:31.331 --> 02:52:32.380
<v Speaker 3>I've done it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of them,</v>

3670
02:52:32.381 --> 02:52:34.030
<v Speaker 3>I want to see what I could do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he said,</v>

3671
02:52:34.060 --> 02:52:35.740
<v Speaker 3>Yo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my wife wasn't into the idea,</v>

3672
02:52:35.741 --> 02:52:39.730
<v Speaker 3>but she insisted that I have a colleague</v>
<v Speaker 3>standing by in case I got into trouble,</v>

3673
02:52:39.760 --> 02:52:44.760
<v Speaker 3>so that made sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did a guy who was going a little to </v>

3674
02:52:44.760 --> 02:52:45.100
<v Speaker 3>the left to the left himself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking vasectomy.</v>

3675
02:52:45.130 --> 02:52:48.250
<v Speaker 3>That is the most bad ass thing I think </v>
<v Speaker 3>I've ever heard.</v>

3676
02:52:48.400 --> 02:52:50.650
<v Speaker 3>Did he like what did he do with his </v>
<v Speaker 3>feet?</v>

<v Speaker 3>it's on this side of the scrotum.</v>

3679
02:53:02.170 --> 02:53:02.950
<v Speaker 3>Maybe yours,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bro,</v>

<v Speaker 3>humbled me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I take these old ladies,</v>

3707
02:54:07.130 --> 02:54:11.050
<v Speaker 3>old housewives and they're fucking tough</v>
<v Speaker 3>as shit and they're in there everyday.</v>

3708
02:54:11.140 --> 02:54:13.720
<v Speaker 3>I come there a couple days a week and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they look at me like,</v>

3709
02:54:13.721 --> 02:54:15.580

<v Speaker 3>decided to drop in.</v>

3710
02:54:15.970 --> 02:54:20.970
<v Speaker 3>So I had to cut every day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every day you see their progress to </v>

3711
02:54:21.280 --> 02:54:26.280
<v Speaker 3>especially.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very impressive to me when you see </v>

3712
02:54:26.280 --> 02:54:29.430
<v Speaker 3>flexibility,</v>
<v Speaker 3>progress and old people and you realize </v>

3713
02:54:29.430 --> 02:54:32.130
<v Speaker 3>like most of what we take for decide </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3714
02:54:32.140 --> 02:54:37.140
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is how far your body should move </v>

3715
02:54:37.140 --> 02:54:37.900
<v Speaker 3>when you're 60 or this is how your body </v>
<v Speaker 3>should move your 70 space in the average</v>

3716
02:54:37.901 --> 02:54:40.300
<v Speaker 3>person who doesn't do a goddamn thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>with their body.</v>

3717
02:54:40.301 --> 02:54:42.080
<v Speaker 3>They don't grow up thinking you don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>eat right.</v>

3718
02:54:42.130 --> 02:54:44.140
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's based on what you see around you.</v>

3719
02:54:44.500 --> 02:54:47.350
<v Speaker 3>In Spain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody goes for a walk after dinner,</v>

3720
02:54:47.410 --> 02:54:48.700
<v Speaker 3>you can be 90 years old.</v>

3721
02:54:48.700 --> 02:54:50.740
<v Speaker 3>They're out there walking in after the </v>
<v Speaker 3>way to go to.</v>

3722
02:54:50.790 --> 02:54:55.790
<v Speaker 3>It's nice if you go to a place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it feels good to have a meal and walk </v>

3723
02:54:55.790 --> 02:54:59.851
<v Speaker 3>around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why it's like you ever eaten </v>

3724
02:54:59.851 --> 02:54:59.851
<v Speaker 3>Malibu.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a Malibu seafood.</v>

3725
02:54:59.851 --> 02:55:00.770
<v Speaker 3>Do you ever see that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know that place,</v>

3726
02:55:00.860 --> 02:55:02.560
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right on that little PCA.</v>

3727
02:55:02.561 --> 02:55:07.561
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eat outside is really good and have </v>

3728
02:55:07.561 --> 02:55:08.500
<v Speaker 3>fresh seafood there all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>About the real in.</v>

3729
02:55:08.940 --> 02:55:09.240
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3730
02:55:09.250 --> 02:55:10.970
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's called Malibu seafood.</v>

3731
02:55:11.180 --> 02:55:12.620
<v Speaker 3>That's what it's called,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but anyway,</v>

3732
02:55:13.340 --> 02:55:18.340
<v Speaker 3>the problem is getting across the pch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to get across pch says death </v>

3733
02:55:18.340 --> 02:55:18.340
<v Speaker 3>defying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3734
02:55:18.340 --> 02:55:19.730
<v Speaker 3>you park on one side and ran across.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3735
02:55:19.731 --> 02:55:21.860
<v Speaker 3>that's across.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially with little kids.</v>

3736
02:55:21.861 --> 02:55:23.600
<v Speaker 3>That's fucking scared.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She'd go to the real end.</v>

3737
02:55:23.630 --> 02:55:25.790
<v Speaker 3>It's on the pch down near to paying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've heard.</v>

3738
02:55:25.791 --> 02:55:26.780
<v Speaker 3>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is good.</v>

3739
02:55:26.781 --> 02:55:27.980
<v Speaker 3>And they've got tables outside.</v>

3740
02:55:27.980 --> 02:55:30.770
<v Speaker 3>You can bring a dog and they kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>picnic tables.</v>

3741
02:55:30.830 --> 02:55:33.230
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we talk about this after.</v>

3742
02:55:33.231 --> 02:55:34.970
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's something about.</v>

3743
02:55:35.390 --> 02:55:36.890
<v Speaker 3>There's another restaurant in Malibu </v>
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>

3744
02:55:36.891 --> 02:55:39.320
<v Speaker 3>That's a really good spot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like right on the beach and you can</v>

3745
02:55:39.620 --> 02:55:43.520
<v Speaker 3>eat and then just go walk and it's like </v>
<v Speaker 3>walking on the beach or just going for a</v>

3746
02:55:43.521 --> 02:55:46.280
<v Speaker 3>walk like right after a meal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what everybody's supposed to do.</v>

3747
02:55:46.490 --> 02:55:47.280
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3748
02:55:47.510 --> 02:55:48.370
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3749
02:55:48.630 --> 02:55:51.530
<v Speaker 3>It helps digestion and when you live in </v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

3750
02:55:51.580 --> 02:55:53.420
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw this so much in Spain.</v>

3751
02:55:53.421 --> 02:55:55.370
<v Speaker 3>When you live in a culture that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>healthy,</v>

3752
02:55:55.880 --> 02:55:58.490
<v Speaker 3>you're healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what my favorite example is?</v>

3753
02:55:58.700 --> 02:55:59.660
<v Speaker 3>Boulder,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Colorado.</v>

3754
02:56:00.250 --> 02:56:05.250
<v Speaker 3>You go to boulder,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody's got fucking Patagonia </v>

3755
02:56:05.250 --> 02:56:07.661
<v Speaker 3>jackets on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're running up hills and dirt bike </v>

3756
02:56:07.661 --> 02:56:10.451
<v Speaker 3>riding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a yoga place every corner and </v>

3757
02:56:10.451 --> 02:56:10.451
<v Speaker 3>people are having fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Having a good to not work.</v>

3758
02:56:10.451 --> 02:56:11.150
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's fun.</v>

3759
02:56:11.360 --> 02:56:14.420
<v Speaker 3>It bulb exercise is fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what people don't understand.</v>

3760
02:56:14.421 --> 02:56:19.421
<v Speaker 3>It's really an,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not fun to be unhealthy and when </v>

3761
02:56:19.421 --> 02:56:20.360
<v Speaker 3>you try to exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're unhealthy,</v>

3762
02:56:20.361 --> 02:56:22.460
<v Speaker 3>it feels like shit because your body </v>
<v Speaker 3>feels like shit.</v>

3763
02:56:22.640 --> 02:56:25.880
<v Speaker 3>But once you get the dust knocked off of</v>
<v Speaker 3>it and get it moving.</v>

3764
02:56:26.060 --> 02:56:30.110
<v Speaker 3>And I'm not talking about crossfit or </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking mma training or Jujitsu,</v>

3765
02:56:30.111 --> 02:56:31.850
<v Speaker 3>I'm just talking about any kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>exercise.</v>

3766
02:56:31.930 --> 02:56:34.160
<v Speaker 3>Just get that blood flow and you'll be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3767
02:56:34.250 --> 02:56:37.910
<v Speaker 3>you'll be a better version of you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got a bike.</v>

3768
02:56:38.370 --> 02:56:39.680
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you don't have talked </v>
<v Speaker 3>about this.</v>

3769
02:56:39.681 --> 02:56:41.720
<v Speaker 3>It's this electric assist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A mountain bike.</v>

3770
02:56:41.750 --> 02:56:46.750
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My friend John Dudley has those made so </v>

3771
02:56:46.750 --> 02:56:47.460
<v Speaker 3>much fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3772
02:56:47.600 --> 02:56:51.020
<v Speaker 3>And where I live it's like uphill to get</v>
<v Speaker 3>to any of the fire roads.</v>

3773
02:56:51.350 --> 02:56:54.590
<v Speaker 3>So a normal bike.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just not going to do it because it's</v>

3774
02:56:54.591 --> 02:56:57.200
<v Speaker 3>like a half hour of hell to get any real</v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting.</v>

3775
02:56:57.710 --> 02:57:00.740
<v Speaker 3>But this thing it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it only assists when you pedal.</v>

3776
02:57:00.970 --> 02:57:05.970
<v Speaker 3>Now there's no throttle or anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A specialized gave it to me because I </v>

3777
02:57:05.970 --> 02:57:10.630
<v Speaker 3>had this dude on my podcast who is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a professional mountain bike racer,</v>

3778
02:57:11.420 --> 02:57:12.590
<v Speaker 3>and he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

3779
02:57:12.591 --> 02:57:15.560
<v Speaker 3>you got to get a bike here in Topanga.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is heaven here.</v>

3780
02:57:16.010 --> 02:57:16.730
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3781
02:57:16.731 --> 02:57:18.890
<v Speaker 3>but like that's where I would ride,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3782
02:57:18.920 --> 02:57:20.270
<v Speaker 3>way the fuck up there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>

3783
02:57:20.271 --> 02:57:21.470
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me talk to some people.</v>

3784
02:57:21.770 --> 02:57:26.770
<v Speaker 3>Well my buddy John Dudley uses those for</v>
<v Speaker 3>deer hunting because when you walk on </v>

3785
02:57:26.871 --> 02:57:31.871
<v Speaker 3>the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well not just that when you walk on the </v>

3786
02:57:31.871 --> 02:57:31.871
<v Speaker 3>ground,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you leave,</v>

3787
02:57:31.871 --> 02:57:33.500
<v Speaker 3>sent a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So instead of doing that,</v>

3788
02:57:33.501 --> 02:57:35.450
<v Speaker 3>he rides a bike.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when you ride a bike,</v>

3789
02:57:35.480 --> 02:57:40.480
<v Speaker 3>you're just like deers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nose is so much stronger and more </v>

3790
02:57:40.611 --> 02:57:45.611
<v Speaker 3>powerful than ours that if the wind is </v>
<v Speaker 3>at your back and the deers in front of </v>

3791
02:57:45.611 --> 02:57:45.611
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're fucked.</v>

3792
02:57:45.611 --> 02:57:47.870
<v Speaker 3>You're fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you play the wind correctly,</v>

3793
02:57:48.020 --> 02:57:53.020
<v Speaker 3>one of the best ways to avoid leaving </v>
<v Speaker 3>scent of a deer passes by after you've </v>

3794
02:57:53.020 --> 02:57:56.741
<v Speaker 3>been there is to ride a bike.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you don't want to ride a bike and </v>

3795
02:57:56.741 --> 02:58:00.521
<v Speaker 3>exert yourself because then you'll be </v>
<v Speaker 3>sweaty and you have to sit in a tree </v>

3796
02:58:00.521 --> 02:58:00.950
<v Speaker 3>stand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'll freeze your fucking ass off.</v>

3797
02:58:01.230 --> 02:58:04.410
<v Speaker 3>So instead he has these electric assist </v>
<v Speaker 3>bikes and they're fucking amazing.</v>

3798
02:58:04.680 --> 02:58:08.220
<v Speaker 3>And when I was in Iowa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we took these suckers out into the woods</v>

3799
02:58:08.250 --> 02:58:09.630
<v Speaker 3>bond.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>

3800
02:58:09.690 --> 02:58:11.880
<v Speaker 3>Like easy pill,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't matter,</v>

3801
02:58:12.180 --> 02:58:14.290
<v Speaker 3>just rode up the hill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No problem.</v>

3802
02:58:14.340 --> 02:58:15.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's still an effort,</v>

3803
02:58:15.901 --> 02:58:19.500
<v Speaker 3>but it's not like you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just like a light walk.</v>

3804
02:58:20.120 --> 02:58:21.940
<v Speaker 3>They're awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I took it out to Utah.</v>

3805
02:58:21.941 --> 02:58:26.550
<v Speaker 3>I was out in the van scarlet to Vanson </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I were out in a canyon lands.</v>

3806
02:58:27.080 --> 02:58:28.710
<v Speaker 3>That's so nice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

3807
02:58:28.770 --> 02:58:30.780
<v Speaker 3>That's so pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there was this one ride,</v>

3808
02:58:30.840 --> 02:58:35.130
<v Speaker 3>it was like 20 miles I think out on this</v>
<v Speaker 3>jeep track,</v>

3809
02:58:35.190 --> 02:58:38.790
<v Speaker 3>like you could never go on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean even in a jeep,</v>

3810
02:58:39.000 --> 02:58:44.000
<v Speaker 3>a serious four wheel drive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going two miles an hour instead </v>

3811
02:58:44.000 --> 02:58:44.000
<v Speaker 3>of these.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But on this bike,</v>

3812
02:58:44.000 --> 02:58:48.870
<v Speaker 3>just just cruise and 20 miles out to </v>
<v Speaker 3>where the Colorado and the Green River </v>

3813
02:58:49.441 --> 02:58:52.230
<v Speaker 3>converge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's this canyon.</v>

3814
02:58:52.410 --> 02:58:54.750
<v Speaker 3>Nobody out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm just cruising.</v>

3815
02:58:54.900 --> 02:58:57.180
<v Speaker 3>It's like riding a horse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so cool.</v>

3816
02:58:57.630 --> 02:59:02.630
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did think at one point when I was </v>

3817
02:59:02.630 --> 02:59:02.940
<v Speaker 3>going through this field with tall </v>
<v Speaker 3>grasses that I,</v>

3818
02:59:03.480 --> 02:59:08.480
<v Speaker 3>to a cougar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would have looked like impossible to </v>

3819
02:59:08.480 --> 02:59:08.480
<v Speaker 3>resist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3820
02:59:08.480 --> 02:59:10.410
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe top speeds.</v>

3821
02:59:10.411 --> 02:59:12.420
<v Speaker 3>Twenty miles an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it would have gotten me.</v>

3822
02:59:12.900 --> 02:59:15.480
<v Speaker 3>Most cougars are not really into </v>
<v Speaker 3>attacking people,</v>

3823
02:59:15.481 --> 02:59:17.610
<v Speaker 3>but they have attack people on mountain </v>
<v Speaker 3>bikes before.</v>

3824
02:59:17.670 --> 02:59:20.090
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3825
02:59:20.160 --> 02:59:22.440
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's like a yarn thing,</v>

3826
02:59:22.441 --> 02:59:23.310
<v Speaker 3>like a ball of yarn.</v>

3827
02:59:23.670 --> 02:59:25.500
<v Speaker 3>Kitten just can't help it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3828
02:59:25.501 --> 02:59:26.400
<v Speaker 3>you've got cats,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3829
02:59:26.420 --> 02:59:27.750
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I somehow,</v>

3830
02:59:27.751 --> 02:59:29.970
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like cats are similar enough that</v>

3831
02:59:29.971 --> 02:59:32.930
<v Speaker 3>if I saw a cougar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't know how to deal with it just</v>

3832
02:59:32.940 --> 02:59:35.010
<v Speaker 3>because I know cats.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>

3833
02:59:35.040 --> 02:59:40.040
<v Speaker 3>You can look in bluff a cat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you see the video I posted up today </v>

3834
02:59:40.040 --> 02:59:43.011
<v Speaker 3>where a guy in boulder,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so for fucking mountain lions on a </v>

3835
02:59:43.011 --> 02:59:45.841
<v Speaker 3>street for together with family,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was the big ones for full grown </v>

3859
03:00:46.990 --> 03:00:50.370

03:00:55.350 --> 03:00:57.300
<v Speaker 3>Worse ways to go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3864
03:01:00.280 --> 03:01:05.280
<v Speaker 6>Between the bears and the dogs or the </v>
<v Speaker 6>cats and also the foxes.</v>

3865
03:01:05.800 --> 03:01:07.450
<v Speaker 6>Foxes are amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

3866
03:01:07.480 --> 03:01:09.310
<v Speaker 6>I love foxes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

3867
03:01:09.640 --> 03:01:14.640
<v Speaker 6>I think they're really interesting </v>
<v Speaker 6>animals and they're one of the few </v>

3868
03:01:14.640 --> 03:01:17.671
<v Speaker 6>animals in the wild that will,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you live in a certain area for long </v>

3869
03:01:17.671 --> 03:01:18.910
<v Speaker 6>enough,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they will almost become domesticated,</v>

3870
03:01:19.140 --> 03:01:24.140
<v Speaker 6>like they get close to you and hang out </v>
<v Speaker 6>with you and you could feed them and </v>

3871
03:01:24.140 --> 03:01:26.401
<v Speaker 6>they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they'll walk with you and hang out with </v>

3872
03:01:26.401 --> 03:01:26.401
<v Speaker 6>you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like real close by.</v>

3873
03:01:26.401 --> 03:01:28.330
<v Speaker 6>There are weird animal.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're not quite a wolf and they're not</v>

3874
03:01:28.331 --> 03:01:32.640
<v Speaker 6>like a coyote like a Fox.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Our relationship with Fox is,</v>

3875
03:01:32.641 --> 03:01:34.960
<v Speaker 6>is very playful,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>

3876
03:01:35.290 --> 03:01:39.460
<v Speaker 6>Have you ever seen a grizzly man?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Remember his relationship with the Fox,</v>

3877
03:01:39.530 --> 03:01:41.500
<v Speaker 6>hung around the campsite or something.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Took his hat,</v>

3878
03:01:41.501 --> 03:01:43.420
<v Speaker 6>stole his,</v>
<v Speaker 6>had ran away and they were playing.</v>

3879
03:01:44.180 --> 03:01:46.960
<v Speaker 6>The Fox used to sit on his tent and he'd</v>
<v Speaker 6>be right there and be like,</v>

3880
03:01:46.961 --> 03:01:47.620
<v Speaker 6>how are you?</v>

3881
03:01:47.650 --> 03:01:49.150
<v Speaker 6>Good morning today.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I like that.</v>

3882
03:01:49.210 --> 03:01:50.680
<v Speaker 6>They would just hang with them and walk </v>
<v Speaker 6>with them.</v>

3883
03:01:50.860 --> 03:01:55.860
<v Speaker 6>There's that lady sue Akins who lives.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She lives 200 plus miles above the </v>

3884
03:01:56.081 --> 03:01:57.670
<v Speaker 6>arctic circle.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She's on that show.</v>

3885
03:01:57.671 --> 03:01:59.020
<v Speaker 6>Life below zero.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There it is.</v>

3886
03:01:59.021 --> 03:02:00.360
<v Speaker 6>There's the grizzly man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

3887
03:02:00.370 --> 03:02:02.710
<v Speaker 6>look at this fucking animal just hanging</v>
<v Speaker 6>with him,</v>

3888
03:02:02.711 --> 03:02:03.430
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

3889
03:02:03.431 --> 03:02:08.431
<v Speaker 6>it's an odd way the fuck out the way the</v>
<v Speaker 6>fuck out.</v>

3890
03:02:08.771 --> 03:02:13.771
<v Speaker 6>But once they get accustomed to you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're very intelligent and they </v>

3891
03:02:13.771 --> 03:02:14.410
<v Speaker 6>realized like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this guy's not going to hurt me.</v>

3892
03:02:14.700 --> 03:02:17.500
<v Speaker 6>And then they become like your little </v>
<v Speaker 6>buddy and if you give them food,</v>

3893
03:02:17.501 --> 03:02:22.501
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is essentially how animals got </v>

3894
03:02:22.501 --> 03:02:22.501
<v Speaker 6>domesticated,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

3895
03:02:22.501 --> 03:02:22.501
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is how wolves became dogs.</v>

3896
03:02:22.501 --> 03:02:27.150
<v Speaker 6>They just hung around with us long </v>
<v Speaker 6>enough that when they were outside the </v>

3897
03:02:27.150 --> 03:02:31.051
<v Speaker 6>edge of the campfire and we gave them </v>
<v Speaker 6>food to keep them from attacking us or </v>

3898
03:02:31.051 --> 03:02:31.051
<v Speaker 6>whatever.</v>

3899
03:02:31.051 --> 03:02:32.770
<v Speaker 6>But Fox is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and in particular,</v>

3900
03:02:33.250 --> 03:02:35.470
<v Speaker 6>they'll kill the shit out of your cat,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but kill your dog.</v>

3901
03:02:35.710 --> 03:02:37.910
<v Speaker 6>Foxes will kill a lot of things to kill </v>
<v Speaker 6>a lot of fonts.</v>

3902
03:02:38.290 --> 03:02:38.840
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

3903
03:02:38.870 --> 03:02:39.830
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I saw um,</v>

3904
03:02:40.020 --> 03:02:45.020
<v Speaker 6>a fox on,</v>
<v Speaker 6>on the Internet with a font that was </v>

3905
03:02:45.020 --> 03:02:48.320
<v Speaker 6>almost as big as its body and it was </v>
<v Speaker 6>dragging this font across this,</v>

3906
03:02:48.330 --> 03:02:49.300
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this road.</v>

3907
03:02:49.301 --> 03:02:49.900
<v Speaker 6>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

3908
03:02:50.620 --> 03:02:52.360
<v Speaker 6>I never thought it would kill something </v>
<v Speaker 6>that big.</v>

3909
03:02:52.950 --> 03:02:57.070
<v Speaker 6>I would thought they'd get rats like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well they do generally right environment</v>

3910
03:02:57.250 --> 03:02:59.900
<v Speaker 6>or not marmots moles and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You'll see the,</v>

3911
03:02:59.901 --> 03:03:02.860
<v Speaker 6>how they jump.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They hear so well they can located under</v>

3912
03:03:02.861 --> 03:03:04.090
<v Speaker 6>the snow.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And Jana.</v>

3913
03:03:04.630 --> 03:03:07.390
<v Speaker 6>Well here's how fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I had a coyote killed one of my chickens</v>

3914
03:03:07.391 --> 03:03:10.760
<v Speaker 6>recently and I buried the chicken and </v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

3915
03:03:10.870 --> 03:03:15.870
<v Speaker 6>I was in the yard the other day.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I heard this noise and my golden </v>

3916
03:03:15.870 --> 03:03:17.980
<v Speaker 6>retriever who has zero killer instinct.</v>

3917
03:03:18.310 --> 03:03:21.250
<v Speaker 6>I mean he'll,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he'll kill a bird or something.</v>

3918
03:03:21.260 --> 03:03:23.680
<v Speaker 6>He gets a hold of it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but he's not like a guard dog.</v>

3919
03:03:23.710 --> 03:03:25.660
<v Speaker 6>He's a sweetie and he's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's like,</v>

3920
03:03:25.661 --> 03:03:28.450
<v Speaker 6>what is going on over there?</v>
<v Speaker 6>And these communities are on the roof of</v>

3921
03:03:28.451 --> 03:03:32.950
<v Speaker 6>the fucking henhouse trying to pry away </v>
<v Speaker 6>the chicken wire.</v>

3922
03:03:33.250 --> 03:03:38.250
<v Speaker 6>And I hear this clink clink clink clink </v>
<v Speaker 6>is the kylies biting the chicken wire </v>

3923
03:03:38.260 --> 03:03:40.180
<v Speaker 6>trying to break it open and get into the</v>
<v Speaker 6>chickens.</v>

3924
03:03:40.840 --> 03:03:42.790
<v Speaker 6>So they killed one chicken.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I chased him off.</v>

3925
03:03:43.710 --> 03:03:45.400
<v Speaker 6>I got a video over there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was going to post their bills.</v>

3926
03:03:45.401 --> 03:03:47.500
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is too gross chicken.</v>

3927
03:03:47.501 --> 03:03:49.540
<v Speaker 6>They got fucked up by this code is plus.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's sad.</v>

3928
03:03:49.541 --> 03:03:51.070
<v Speaker 6>I love those chickens,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're like a pet,</v>

3929
03:03:51.090 --> 03:03:53.320
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so I dug a whole bird,</v>

3930
03:03:53.321 --> 03:03:58.321
<v Speaker 6>the chicken and the coyote.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He dunked the fucking hole up and found </v>

3931
03:03:58.321 --> 03:03:59.930
<v Speaker 6>chicken and it was a couple feet down.</v>

3932
03:04:00.350 --> 03:04:02.420
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it wasn't a super shallow grave.</v>

3933
03:04:02.640 --> 03:04:07.640
<v Speaker 6>I mean that coyote smelled that chicken </v>
<v Speaker 6>through two feet of dirt and went and </v>

3934
03:04:08.031 --> 03:04:11.010
<v Speaker 6>dug it out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I went out there a couple days later and</v>

3935
03:04:11.011 --> 03:04:12.650
<v Speaker 6>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>where's the fucking chicken?</v>

3936
03:04:12.651 --> 03:04:13.790
<v Speaker 6>There's just a hole there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was like,</v>

3937
03:04:13.791 --> 03:04:15.830
<v Speaker 6>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is crazy.</v>

3938
03:04:16.430 --> 03:04:18.230
<v Speaker 6>They could smell through the dirt,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

3939
03:04:18.800 --> 03:04:22.430
<v Speaker 6>They knew the chicken was down there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's crazy.</v>

3940
03:04:22.520 --> 03:04:26.510
<v Speaker 6>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do you ever have strange experience with</v>

3941
03:04:26.511 --> 03:04:31.511
<v Speaker 6>wild animals while you were tripping?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Never have zero experience with animals </v>

3942
03:04:31.941 --> 03:04:35.390
<v Speaker 6>while tripping a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Cause I tripped in the woods alone.</v>

3943
03:04:36.050 --> 03:04:36.590
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>

3944
03:04:36.591 --> 03:04:41.330
<v Speaker 6>I know too much about the words.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I want a trip inside of arm compound.</v>

3945
03:04:42.590 --> 03:04:45.200
<v Speaker 6>Well that'll be safe.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Loaded guns nearby.</v>

3946
03:04:46.010 --> 03:04:50.250
<v Speaker 6>A fear fetish.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

3947
03:04:50.420 --> 03:04:52.550
<v Speaker 6>almost joking.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Around half of it is for entertainment.</v>

3948
03:04:53.490 --> 03:04:55.640
<v Speaker 6>I've gotten.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've done mushrooms in a field before.</v>

3949
03:04:56.680 --> 03:05:01.680
<v Speaker 6>It didn't freak me out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>A baseball field when Aubrey and I went </v>

3950
03:05:01.680 --> 03:05:05.771
<v Speaker 6>bear hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he took mushrooms one of the days I </v>

3951
03:05:05.771 --> 03:05:05.771
<v Speaker 6>didn't.</v>

3952
03:05:05.771 --> 03:05:05.771
<v Speaker 6>I wasn't with him.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

3953
03:05:05.771 --> 03:05:08.330
<v Speaker 6>when you go to your own little area of </v>
<v Speaker 6>the woods by yourself,</v>

3954
03:05:08.380 --> 03:05:10.790
<v Speaker 6>I find it hard to shoot anything.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If I were tripping,</v>

3955
03:05:11.090 --> 03:05:12.290
<v Speaker 6>you wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you were hungry.</v>

3956
03:05:12.860 --> 03:05:16.010
<v Speaker 6>The thing about those things is like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>bear hunting is a weird one man,</v>

3957
03:05:16.130 --> 03:05:21.130
<v Speaker 6>because they need to control the </v>
<v Speaker 6>populations because if they don't </v>

3958
03:05:21.130 --> 03:05:23.831
<v Speaker 6>control the populations,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the bears decimate the moose and the </v>

3959
03:05:23.831 --> 03:05:23.990
<v Speaker 6>deer and they eat 50 percent of the Fonz</v>
<v Speaker 6>as it is,</v>

3960
03:05:24.020 --> 03:05:24.710
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If,</v>

3961
03:05:24.711 --> 03:05:25.070
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if,</v>

3962
03:05:25.071 --> 03:05:30.071
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>although deer populations out of </v>

3963
03:05:30.071 --> 03:05:30.071
<v Speaker 6>control,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a lot of places,</v>

3964
03:05:30.071 --> 03:05:32.150
<v Speaker 6>not,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not in Alberta have Pennsylvania,</v>

3965
03:05:32.151 --> 03:05:33.950
<v Speaker 6>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's a healthy balance,</v>

3966
03:05:34.100 --> 03:05:37.580
<v Speaker 6>but it's only apparently a healthy </v>
<v Speaker 6>balance according to biologists.</v>

3967
03:05:37.610 --> 03:05:39.290
<v Speaker 6>And it's not according to vegans are </v>
<v Speaker 6>hunters,</v>

3968
03:05:39.500 --> 03:05:43.190
<v Speaker 6>but according to biologist,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's only healthy if the bear population</v>

3969
03:05:43.191 --> 03:05:46.040
<v Speaker 6>is kept to a certain number.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If it gets too crazy,</v>

3970
03:05:46.220 --> 03:05:50.300
<v Speaker 6>then they run out of food and then </v>
<v Speaker 6>there's a lot of cannibalism already,</v>

3971
03:05:50.510 --> 03:05:52.280
<v Speaker 6>but then it gets even worse and you </v>
<v Speaker 6>know,</v>

3972
03:05:52.281 --> 03:05:55.580
<v Speaker 6>then they start encroaching on cities </v>
<v Speaker 6>and towns and it gets.</v>

3973
03:05:56.120 --> 03:05:59.970
<v Speaker 6>It gets weird,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but are they treated it in terms of like</v>

3974
03:06:00.080 --> 03:06:05.080
<v Speaker 6>a number thing instead of looking at it </v>
<v Speaker 6>from a moral standpoint like should you </v>

3975
03:06:05.080 --> 03:06:05.090
<v Speaker 6>kill an animal?</v>
<v Speaker 6>They.</v>

3976
03:06:05.160 --> 03:06:05.550
<v Speaker 6>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

3977
03:06:05.551 --> 03:06:08.250
<v Speaker 6>if you don't kill an animal,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this animal is overbalanced this,</v>

3978
03:06:08.251 --> 03:06:13.251
<v Speaker 6>that overpopulated,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this animal's going to be under </v>

3979
03:06:13.251 --> 03:06:13.251
<v Speaker 6>populated now because they're going to </v>
<v Speaker 6>go after them.</v>

3980
03:06:13.251 --> 03:06:14.060
<v Speaker 6>They get to kill a disproportionate </v>
<v Speaker 6>number of them,</v>

3981
03:06:14.440 --> 03:06:17.570
<v Speaker 6>so they try to keep this so.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But bears are apex predators.</v>

3982
03:06:17.571 --> 03:06:20.600
<v Speaker 6>So who was killing bears?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Other bears,</v>

3983
03:06:20.930 --> 03:06:24.170
<v Speaker 6>grizzlies.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So then the sort of the ultimate balance</v>

3984
03:06:24.230 --> 03:06:27.050
<v Speaker 6>is to just leave the bears and let the </v>
<v Speaker 6>other bears kill him.</v>

3985
03:06:27.140 --> 03:06:32.140
<v Speaker 6>That's a good balance.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But then you're living in a world where </v>

3986
03:06:32.140 --> 03:06:34.310
<v Speaker 6>you have 11 foot 12 foot grizzlies </v>
<v Speaker 6>everywhere you go wandering into town.</v>

3987
03:06:34.550 --> 03:06:37.580
<v Speaker 6>If you live in a place like Alberta in </v>
<v Speaker 6>some,</v>

3988
03:06:37.640 --> 03:06:41.060
<v Speaker 6>some areas of Alberta,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you have know good population of elk and</v>

3989
03:06:41.061 --> 03:06:43.760
<v Speaker 6>Moose and deer,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well that means you're gonna have a good</v>

3990
03:06:43.761 --> 03:06:46.640
<v Speaker 6>population of monsters,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so if you're comfortable with that,</v>

3991
03:06:48.960 --> 03:06:52.460
<v Speaker 6>you just have to decide how much risk do</v>
<v Speaker 6>you want to have.</v>

3992
03:06:52.940 --> 03:06:55.190
<v Speaker 6>Because once the bears chew through </v>
<v Speaker 6>them,</v>

3993
03:06:55.230 --> 03:06:56.760
<v Speaker 6>they're going to go after you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You should,</v>

3994
03:06:56.880 --> 03:06:58.960
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Boris with the bow.</v>

3995
03:06:59.440 --> 03:07:00.210
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've done that.</v>

3996
03:07:00.260 --> 03:07:00.870
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3997
03:07:01.000 --> 03:07:02.830
<v Speaker 6>A friend of mine invited me to go,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3998
03:07:03.260 --> 03:07:05.700
<v Speaker 6>do that in Hawaii.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Hawaii has to do it.</v>

3999
03:07:05.760 --> 03:07:07.890
<v Speaker 6>It's a good place because of that I </v>
<v Speaker 6>don't have any predators.</v>

4000
03:07:07.891 --> 03:07:12.891
<v Speaker 6>And they fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And he was explaining that the boers </v>

4001
03:07:12.891 --> 03:07:16.521
<v Speaker 6>fuck up the coral reefs because they dig</v>
<v Speaker 6>up all the dirt and then it runs off in </v>

4002
03:07:16.521 --> 03:07:18.730
<v Speaker 6>the rain and it contaminates the bays </v>
<v Speaker 6>are.</v>

4003
03:07:18.731 --> 03:07:19.820
<v Speaker 6>That makes sense?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

4004
03:07:19.860 --> 03:07:24.860
<v Speaker 6>So it's a really big thing in Hawaii </v>
<v Speaker 6>that they have to really go after the </v>

4005
03:07:24.860 --> 03:07:28.110
<v Speaker 6>bars as much as there's a project right </v>
<v Speaker 6>now in Maui where they,</v>

4006
03:07:28.560 --> 03:07:33.560
<v Speaker 6>they're going to fence in an area and </v>
<v Speaker 6>the area that they're fenced in,</v>

4007
03:07:33.720 --> 03:07:35.160
<v Speaker 6>they have to.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like 5,000</v>

4008
03:07:35.161 --> 03:07:36.000
<v Speaker 6>acres,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think it is,</v>

4009
03:07:36.240 --> 03:07:41.240
<v Speaker 6>where they have to eradicate the deer </v>
<v Speaker 6>that are in this one particular area </v>

4010
03:07:41.240 --> 03:07:44.170
<v Speaker 6>because they're trying to reclaim the </v>
<v Speaker 6>forest land and a lot of these deer,</v>

4011
03:07:45.030 --> 03:07:50.030
<v Speaker 6>the deer,</v>
<v Speaker 6>most of the large mammals in Hawaii are </v>

4012
03:07:50.030 --> 03:07:50.820
<v Speaker 6>not native and so these invasive species</v>
<v Speaker 6>is access.</v>

4013
03:07:50.820 --> 03:07:54.480
<v Speaker 6>Deer from Asia actually are just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they eat everything.</v>

4014
03:07:54.510 --> 03:07:59.510
<v Speaker 6>Nothing gets to grow,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like just getting not going to be a </v>

4015
03:07:59.510 --> 03:07:59.510
<v Speaker 6>forest because the little things grow </v>
<v Speaker 6>and they just eat them,</v>

4016
03:07:59.510 --> 03:08:00.270
<v Speaker 6>eat them right when they're coming up </v>
<v Speaker 6>and they just.</v>

4017
03:08:00.300 --> 03:08:05.300
<v Speaker 6>There's so many of them,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so they also have a problem with people </v>

4018
03:08:05.300 --> 03:08:06.720
<v Speaker 6>needing food,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so what they're doing is they're like,</v>

4019
03:08:06.780 --> 03:08:11.780
<v Speaker 6>they have this project where they're </v>
<v Speaker 6>going out and they're hunting these </v>

4020
03:08:11.780 --> 03:08:13.851
<v Speaker 6>animals,</v>
<v Speaker 6>killing them and giving these food to </v>

4021
03:08:13.851 --> 03:08:13.851
<v Speaker 6>people for free and so they've set it up</v>
<v Speaker 6>like this.</v>

4022
03:08:13.851 --> 03:08:16.050
<v Speaker 6>So they have a real sustainable food </v>
<v Speaker 6>source for all these poor people,</v>

4023
03:08:16.200 --> 03:08:18.480
<v Speaker 6>which is the best meat in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So delicious.</v>

4024
03:08:18.481 --> 03:08:21.510
<v Speaker 6>I was going to say much better than </v>
<v Speaker 6>industrial.</v>

4025
03:08:21.690 --> 03:08:22.620
<v Speaker 6>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Shit.</v>

4026
03:08:23.200 --> 03:08:24.510
<v Speaker 6>It's really good.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

4027
03:08:24.511 --> 03:08:29.511
<v Speaker 6>even in terms of wild game animals,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they have the most delicious game </v>

4028
03:08:29.511 --> 03:08:29.640
<v Speaker 6>animal,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like two thoughts.</v>

4029
03:08:29.670 --> 03:08:32.970
<v Speaker 6>It's usually,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's either elk or access deer.</v>

4030
03:08:33.000 --> 03:08:34.950
<v Speaker 6>Those are the two to go back and forth.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've had both.</v>

4031
03:08:34.951 --> 03:08:39.951
<v Speaker 6>They're both amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But access to your are fucking </v>

4032
03:08:39.951 --> 03:08:39.951
<v Speaker 6>everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Never had bison.</v>

4033
03:08:39.951 --> 03:08:40.640
<v Speaker 6>You must have.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>

4034
03:08:40.710 --> 03:08:41.530
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's,</v>

4035
03:08:41.570 --> 03:08:42.320
<v Speaker 6>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

4036
03:08:42.370 --> 03:08:44.210
<v Speaker 6>free.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Amazing.</v>

4037
03:08:44.580 --> 03:08:47.300
<v Speaker 6>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Cool animal to see in a while.</v>

4038
03:08:47.340 --> 03:08:49.350
<v Speaker 6>You have a star wars around.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

4039
03:08:49.410 --> 03:08:50.250
<v Speaker 6>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

4040
03:08:50.251 --> 03:08:52.350
<v Speaker 6>We saw them in yellowstone.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Big Herd of.</v>

4041
03:08:52.351 --> 03:08:57.351
<v Speaker 6>I'm just chilling,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it was weird because they were so </v>

4042
03:08:57.351 --> 03:08:58.080
<v Speaker 6>accustomed to people to just lounge in </v>
<v Speaker 6>like 100 yards from folks.</v>

4043
03:08:58.140 --> 03:09:02.520
<v Speaker 6>Can you imagine like before they shot </v>
<v Speaker 6>them all that oceans of those things.</v>

4044
03:09:02.521 --> 03:09:04.320
<v Speaker 6>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Know where that came from.</v>

4045
03:09:04.321 --> 03:09:06.030
<v Speaker 6>That's another one.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's a weird one that I didn't know.</v>

4046
03:09:06.031 --> 03:09:08.850
<v Speaker 6>Dan Flores is a fascinating guy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He wrote a book,</v>

4047
03:09:08.990 --> 03:09:11.670
<v Speaker 6>a great book and coyotes called Coyote </v>
<v Speaker 6>America,</v>

4048
03:09:12.000 --> 03:09:13.080
<v Speaker 6>but he wrote a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

4049
03:09:13.200 --> 03:09:14.910
<v Speaker 6>a pete.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was a paper,</v>

4050
03:09:15.540 --> 03:09:17.940
<v Speaker 6>a bison,</v>
<v Speaker 6>diplomacy.</v>

4051
03:09:17.941 --> 03:09:19.560
<v Speaker 6>Bison ecology.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's the name of it.</v>

4052
03:09:20.210 --> 03:09:25.210
<v Speaker 6>But it's basically saying that what </v>
<v Speaker 6>happened was when the Europeans came to </v>

4053
03:09:25.210 --> 03:09:28.851
<v Speaker 6>America and the European spread disease,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it decimated the native American </v>

4054
03:09:28.851 --> 03:09:33.180
<v Speaker 6>population by as much as 90 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That is when the bison boom happened.</v>

4055
03:09:33.720 --> 03:09:38.160
<v Speaker 6>Bison ecology and bison diplomacy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The southern plains from 1800 1850.</v>

4056
03:09:38.430 --> 03:09:42.930
<v Speaker 6>So what his,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what his take is that the overpopulation</v>

4057
03:09:42.931 --> 03:09:47.931
<v Speaker 6>of Bison was a direct result of these </v>
<v Speaker 6>native American people being decimated </v>

4058
03:09:48.750 --> 03:09:51.060
<v Speaker 6>because their population dropped by 90 </v>
<v Speaker 6>percent.</v>

4059
03:09:51.061 --> 03:09:54.100
<v Speaker 6>No one was hunting the buffalo.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So the buffalo just</v>

4060
03:09:54.100 --> 03:09:59.100
<v Speaker 5>went crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And there's with no hunters chasing </v>

4061
03:09:59.100 --> 03:09:59.100
<v Speaker 5>after him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One,</v>

4062
03:09:59.100 --> 03:09:59.680
<v Speaker 5>two,</v>
<v Speaker 5>three decades later,</v>

4063
03:09:59.860 --> 03:10:03.760
<v Speaker 5>you've got a shit ton of Bison says </v>
<v Speaker 5>running around everywhere.</v>

4064
03:10:04.030 --> 03:10:09.030
<v Speaker 5>And he points to early settlers that </v>
<v Speaker 5>described in great detail all of the </v>

4065
03:10:09.431 --> 03:10:11.290
<v Speaker 5>various game animals that they came </v>
<v Speaker 5>across.</v>

4066
03:10:11.291 --> 03:10:16.291
<v Speaker 5>But nerium mentioned of the Bison and </v>
<v Speaker 5>certainly not a mention of like these </v>

4067
03:10:16.291 --> 03:10:19.360
<v Speaker 5>gigantic million strong herds of bison </v>
<v Speaker 5>roaming the plains.</v>

4068
03:10:19.670 --> 03:10:22.300
<v Speaker 5>Anything that's a direct result of all </v>
<v Speaker 5>of their predators,</v>

4069
03:10:22.540 --> 03:10:27.540
<v Speaker 5>the native Americans who had got really </v>
<v Speaker 5>good hunting them and even even surplus,</v>

4070
03:10:27.941 --> 03:10:30.760
<v Speaker 5>letting them where they drive them off </v>
<v Speaker 5>cliffs and just take what they could.</v>

4071
03:10:30.761 --> 03:10:35.761
<v Speaker 5>That was at the bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Although it's also interesting to think </v>

4072
03:10:35.761 --> 03:10:37.570
<v Speaker 5>how the introduction of horses would </v>
<v Speaker 5>have changed everything.</v>

4073
03:10:37.870 --> 03:10:42.870
<v Speaker 5>Horses and guns.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What Dan Flores says that is that just </v>

4074
03:10:42.870 --> 03:10:42.910
<v Speaker 5>with this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>with why,</v>

4075
03:10:43.060 --> 03:10:48.060
<v Speaker 5>just forget about European settlers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just the native Americans with horses </v>

4076
03:10:48.060 --> 03:10:50.530
<v Speaker 5>and rifles were on their way to extra </v>
<v Speaker 5>painting the by the Bison.</v>

4077
03:10:51.790 --> 03:10:52.810
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Crazy.</v>

4078
03:10:53.200 --> 03:10:54.700
<v Speaker 5>So we,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

4079
03:10:54.701 --> 03:10:59.701
<v Speaker 5>this does not exonerate all the </v>
<v Speaker 5>Europeans that had the stacks of bones </v>

4080
03:10:59.701 --> 03:11:02.140
<v Speaker 5>and that killed them in mass.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They certainly did that.</v>

4081
03:11:02.410 --> 03:11:05.860
<v Speaker 5>There's no doubt about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's what almost caused the,</v>

4082
03:11:05.900 --> 03:11:07.660
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the complete extinction.</v>

4083
03:11:07.920 --> 03:11:09.430
<v Speaker 5>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was at the end.</v>

4084
03:11:09.431 --> 03:11:10.780
<v Speaker 5>It was the Europeans.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was us,</v>

4085
03:11:10.781 --> 03:11:13.130
<v Speaker 5>the settlers to starve out the Indians.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4086
03:11:13.210 --> 03:11:13.540
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

4087
03:11:13.541 --> 03:11:14.610
<v Speaker 5>it wasn't even.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That is,</v>

4088
03:11:14.620 --> 03:11:17.920
<v Speaker 5>that's another thing that they think </v>
<v Speaker 5>that there was not a concerted effort to</v>

4089
03:11:17.921 --> 03:11:20.260
<v Speaker 5>starve about the Indians.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They wanted it for search for food.</v>

4090
03:11:20.530 --> 03:11:25.530
<v Speaker 5>They wanted the tongues.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What I read is the Buffalo Bill and </v>

4091
03:11:25.530 --> 03:11:27.100
<v Speaker 5>those dudes were shooting them and just </v>
<v Speaker 5>leaving the bodies out there.</v>

4092
03:11:27.101 --> 03:11:31.780
<v Speaker 5>It was to wipe out the Lakota because </v>
<v Speaker 5>they couldn't fucking beat the Lakota.</v>

4093
03:11:31.870 --> 03:11:33.950
<v Speaker 5>That might've been done as well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that's not.</v>

4094
03:11:34.080 --> 03:11:36.280
<v Speaker 5>That's not what.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What killed them off.</v>

4095
03:11:36.360 --> 03:11:38.740
<v Speaker 5>I mean when you see these giant stacks </v>
<v Speaker 5>of skulls,</v>

4096
03:11:39.040 --> 03:11:41.410
<v Speaker 5>they were doing that for using them as a</v>
<v Speaker 5>commodity.</v>

4097
03:11:41.800 --> 03:11:43.900
<v Speaker 5>A lot of it was just for their tongues,</v>
<v Speaker 5>believe it or not.</v>

4098
03:11:44.440 --> 03:11:47.140
<v Speaker 5>Their tongues were very valuable,</v>
<v Speaker 5>valuable delicacy,</v>

4099
03:11:47.141 --> 03:11:49.890
<v Speaker 5>and then it was for their skins and you </v>
<v Speaker 5>know when they.</v>

4100
03:11:50.640 --> 03:11:53.920
<v Speaker 5>They had meat hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They had what they called market hunting</v>

4101
03:11:54.040 --> 03:11:57.430
<v Speaker 5>where they take guys who came back from </v>
<v Speaker 5>the war and they were looking for a job,</v>

4102
03:11:57.431 --> 03:11:59.290
<v Speaker 5>but one of the best jobs and get,</v>
<v Speaker 5>are you good shot?</v>

4103
03:11:59.470 --> 03:12:01.090
<v Speaker 5>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can be a hunter,</v>

4104
03:12:01.330 --> 03:12:03.610
<v Speaker 5>and they would go and shoot fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>everything.</v>

4105
03:12:03.640 --> 03:12:07.060
<v Speaker 5>Everything that moved and they wiped out</v>
<v Speaker 5>all the antelope,</v>

4106
03:12:07.500 --> 03:12:08.260
<v Speaker 5>elk,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all the.</v>

4107
03:12:08.440 --> 03:12:13.440
<v Speaker 5>It wasn't just the bison,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just the bison is such an iconic </v>

4108
03:12:13.440 --> 03:12:15.820
<v Speaker 5>thing and then obviously those piles of </v>
<v Speaker 5>skulls,</v>

4109
03:12:15.821 --> 03:12:20.821
<v Speaker 5>it was unusual.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The amount of effort they put into </v>

4110
03:12:20.821 --> 03:12:23.700
<v Speaker 5>killing them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I don't think it was necessarily </v>

4111
03:12:23.700 --> 03:12:25.000
<v Speaker 5>just to just to wipe out them so that </v>
<v Speaker 5>the native Americans would star.</v>

4112
03:12:25.090 --> 03:12:28.300
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure they did that locally and bury </v>
<v Speaker 5>my heart at wounded knee.</v>

4113
03:12:29.560 --> 03:12:30.430
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think I did.</v>

4114
03:12:30.460 --> 03:12:35.460
<v Speaker 5>It's a beautiful book.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's really interesting book about the </v>

4115
03:12:35.460 --> 03:12:38.850
<v Speaker 5>sort of final chapter of different </v>
<v Speaker 5>tribes in North America,</v>

4116
03:12:39.700 --> 03:12:44.700
<v Speaker 5>Jeronimo and the Apaches and sitting </v>
<v Speaker 5>bull and all these people and it's just </v>

4117
03:12:44.831 --> 03:12:49.831
<v Speaker 5>really interesting the story of the sort</v>
<v Speaker 5>of contact and the characters and the </v>

4118
03:12:49.831 --> 03:12:51.950
<v Speaker 5>different things that happen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4119
03:12:51.951 --> 03:12:52.040
<v Speaker 5>I</v>

4120
03:12:52.040 --> 03:12:55.430
<v Speaker 3>read that when I was very young when I </v>
<v Speaker 3>was running around in a loin cloth,</v>

4121
03:12:55.940 --> 03:12:58.480
<v Speaker 3>throwing apples at rabbits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is,</v>

4122
03:12:58.580 --> 03:13:01.310
<v Speaker 3>if you look at human history,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is this here?</v>

4123
03:13:02.150 --> 03:13:03.380
<v Speaker 3>They used to shoot them from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>From.</v>

4124
03:13:04.100 --> 03:13:05.000
<v Speaker 3>From trains.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4125
03:13:05.180 --> 03:13:06.360
<v Speaker 3>They did it for fun too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4126
03:13:07.070 --> 03:13:08.270
<v Speaker 3>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4127
03:13:08.660 --> 03:13:13.660
<v Speaker 3>There were so many of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just thought they could just shoot </v>

4128
03:13:13.660 --> 03:13:13.660
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What else?</v>

4129
03:13:13.660 --> 03:13:15.470
<v Speaker 3>What our relationship with the natural </v>
<v Speaker 3>world that represents,</v>

4130
03:13:15.471 --> 03:13:20.471
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well this is what I was going to say is </v>

4131
03:13:20.471 --> 03:13:22.241
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has there ever been anything like that </v>

4132
03:13:22.241 --> 03:13:25.600
<v Speaker 3>other than I mean anything in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the impact of a group of people landing </v>

4133
03:13:26.871 --> 03:13:29.960
<v Speaker 3>on a continent like nothing that we've </v>
<v Speaker 3>ever observed,</v>

4134
03:13:29.990 --> 03:13:33.470
<v Speaker 3>so the greatest mortality in history for</v>
<v Speaker 3>sure and did great.</v>

4135
03:13:33.471 --> 03:13:38.471
<v Speaker 3>It's changed to like not only that but </v>
<v Speaker 3>this weird movement to the west and like</v>

4136
03:13:39.890 --> 03:13:44.890
<v Speaker 3>landing landing on this weird continent </v>
<v Speaker 3>that was filled with these people that </v>

4137
03:13:45.471 --> 03:13:47.120
<v Speaker 3>lived in a completely different way.</v>

4138
03:13:47.360 --> 03:13:52.360
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are the odds that you're going to </v>

4139
03:13:52.360 --> 03:13:52.820
<v Speaker 3>get to a place you think of where Europe</v>
<v Speaker 3>was in the 17 hundreds,</v>

4140
03:13:52.910 --> 03:13:54.850
<v Speaker 3>the 14 hundreds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4141
03:13:54.860 --> 03:13:59.860
<v Speaker 3>when the first started arriving and </v>
<v Speaker 3>think of the sophistication with the </v>

4142
03:13:59.860 --> 03:14:00.980
<v Speaker 3>boats and the written language and all </v>
<v Speaker 3>the different things,</v>

4143
03:14:01.190 --> 03:14:06.190
<v Speaker 3>and then they show up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go across the ocean and land to a place </v>

4144
03:14:06.190 --> 03:14:06.940
<v Speaker 3>that has zero cities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

4145
03:14:06.950 --> 03:14:09.020
<v Speaker 3>there were cities to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The land was.</v>

4146
03:14:09.110 --> 03:14:12.080
<v Speaker 3>Was bigger than almost all European </v>
<v Speaker 3>cities.</v>

4147
03:14:12.081 --> 03:14:15.890
<v Speaker 3>When Cortez walked into it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's in Mexico.</v>

4148
03:14:15.891 --> 03:14:20.480
<v Speaker 3>That's where the Aztecs were.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They also had sewage and lit streets.</v>

4149
03:14:20.580 --> 03:14:22.850
<v Speaker 3>They did more in South America and North</v>
<v Speaker 3>America,</v>

4150
03:14:22.851 --> 03:14:23.240
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4151
03:14:23.270 --> 03:14:24.320
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nor from.</v>

4152
03:14:24.380 --> 03:14:25.910
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're talking about America,</v>

4153
03:14:25.911 --> 03:14:30.911
<v Speaker 3>Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was nothing comparable at that </v>

4154
03:14:30.911 --> 03:14:30.911
<v Speaker 3>point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's what I meant.</v>

4155
03:14:30.911 --> 03:14:34.560
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like when they're landing here and they </v>

4156
03:14:34.560 --> 03:14:34.560
<v Speaker 3>made their way all the way to </v>
<v Speaker 3>California,</v>

4157
03:14:34.560 --> 03:14:35.390
<v Speaker 3>they're not encountering a single city.</v>

4158
03:14:35.420 --> 03:14:36.290
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
