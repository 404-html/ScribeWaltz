<v Speaker 1>because in Jersey you pay the gas guy,</v>

148
00:04:26.411 --> 00:04:27.430
<v Speaker 1>you don't go into a store,</v>

149
00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:28.660
<v Speaker 1>you know they pump your gas.</v>

150
00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:30.580
<v Speaker 1>So if you robbed the Guy,</v>

151
00:04:30.581 --> 00:04:32.080
<v Speaker 1>you basically robbed the joint.</v>

152
00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:33.093
<v Speaker 1>Do you follow me?</v>

153
00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:36.670
<v Speaker 1>Only Oregon and New Jersey is where the people pumped your gas.</v>

154
00:04:36.671 --> 00:04:37.181
<v Speaker 1>Everybody else,</v>

155
00:04:37.181 --> 00:04:38.260
<v Speaker 1>you walk in with a card.</v>

156
00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:39.581
<v Speaker 1>So we were kids.</v>

157
00:04:39.581 --> 00:04:39.821
<v Speaker 1>We were like,</v>

158
00:04:39.821 --> 00:04:41.110
<v Speaker 1>let's rob a fucked up Freddy.</v>

159
00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:42.401
<v Speaker 1>You know when I worked there,</v>

160
00:04:42.401 --> 00:04:45.250
<v Speaker 1>I got to know Freddy Freddy's wife looked like honey boo boos mother.</v>

161
00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:46.780
<v Speaker 1>But he was a little guy.</v>

162
00:04:46.781 --> 00:04:47.614
<v Speaker 1>But he brought,</v>

163
00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:52.540
<v Speaker 1>his wife was like 400 pounds and the only way she would let him fuck him as if</v>

164
00:04:52.541 --> 00:04:55.540
<v Speaker 1>he brought blow home and he was a skinny,</v>

165
00:04:55.541 --> 00:04:57.070
<v Speaker 1>tiny guy like Eddie Bravo.</v>

166
00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:01.090
<v Speaker 1>She was like three 90 and she would actually put the Bikini and they,</v>

167
00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:02.590
<v Speaker 1>they were such white trash.</v>

168
00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:05.890
<v Speaker 1>They lived in a studio apartment and they would rent the Jacuzzi and putting in</v>

169
00:05:05.891 --> 00:05:06.724
<v Speaker 1>the living room.</v>

170
00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:08.860
<v Speaker 1>These people were fucking,</v>

171
00:05:08.861 --> 00:05:09.910
<v Speaker 1>they lived on the third floor.</v>

172
00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.903
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

173
00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:14.080
<v Speaker 1>And it was the worst building in the neighborhood.</v>

174
00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:15.790
<v Speaker 1>And they had black Marlowe.</v>

175
00:05:15.791 --> 00:05:17.410
<v Speaker 1>She was the only black girl in the neighborhood,</v>

176
00:05:17.411 --> 00:05:18.011
<v Speaker 1>black bottle.</v>

177
00:05:18.011 --> 00:05:19.480
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what black Marlowe is today,</v>

178
00:05:19.481 --> 00:05:21.040
<v Speaker 1>but she's the Real Martin Luther King.</v>

179
00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.920
<v Speaker 1>She was the only black girl in a white neighborhood and Jersey girl look</v>

180
00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:25.813
<v Speaker 1>torture.</v>

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:26.920
<v Speaker 1>She got tortured.</v>

182
00:05:26.921 --> 00:05:27.701
<v Speaker 1>I always loved black.</v>

00:05:27.701 --> 00:05:28.270
<v Speaker 1>Marlo.</v>

184
00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:29.310
<v Speaker 1>Marlo was tight with me,</v>

185
00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:30.550
<v Speaker 1>her mother was white.</v>

219
00:06:33.521 --> 00:06:34.520
<v Speaker 1>like the army base,</v>

220
00:06:34.521 --> 00:06:36.530
<v Speaker 1>so you remember if you lived in New York,</v>

228
00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:54.950
<v Speaker 1>We ran away and he guessed it like it took him a week.</v>

229
00:06:54.951 --> 00:06:55.210
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:03.010
<v Speaker 1>Then he came back to us.</v>

248
00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:28.330

254
00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:36.561
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't do it.</v>

255
00:07:36.561 --> 00:07:37.590
<v Speaker 1>I had too much of a harsh,</v>

256
00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:38.463
<v Speaker 1>I always had a higher,</v>

257
00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:40.520
<v Speaker 1>like I had to bring like one of my crazy friends</v>

258
00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:45.020
<v Speaker 1>that was having like a bad week.</v>

259
00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:48.800
<v Speaker 1>There's a kid in Miami today that every time,</v>

260
00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:51.740
<v Speaker 1>every time I place south Florida,</v>

261
00:07:51.741 --> 00:07:55.280
<v Speaker 1>he shows up with his girlfriend and he gets fucked up and he tells a story.</v>

262
00:07:55.281 --> 00:07:59.960
<v Speaker 1>When I knocked on his door with a diagram on how we were going to rob Freddy and</v>

263
00:07:59.961 --> 00:08:00.261
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>

264
00:08:00.261 --> 00:08:02.720
<v Speaker 1>that's when I knew that you were fucking for real.</v>

265
00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:03.470
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

266
00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:04.970
<v Speaker 1>I was eating dinner with my family.</v>

267
00:08:04.971 --> 00:08:07.760
<v Speaker 1>You can knock on the door and had a sketch like the deal,</v>

268
00:08:07.761 --> 00:08:11.130
<v Speaker 1>how you are going to kick them and run into the weeds and go right to the coke</v>

269
00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:11.721
<v Speaker 1>dealer house.</v>

270
00:08:11.721 --> 00:08:12.560
<v Speaker 1>Like I had it planned.</v>

271
00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:13.940
<v Speaker 1>We had done it so many times,</v>

272
00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:18.050
<v Speaker 1>but I had to keep getting different partners because I couldn't hit Freddie.</v>

273
00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:19.190
<v Speaker 1>All I could do was tackle them.</v>

274
00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:22.580
<v Speaker 1>I was good at tackling them and then we want to go down and have my friend kick</v>

275
00:08:22.581 --> 00:08:23.211
<v Speaker 1>him a few times.</v>

276
00:08:23.211 --> 00:08:24.140
<v Speaker 1>It was fucking horrible.</v>

277
00:08:24.141 --> 00:08:25.940
<v Speaker 1>But when you're 16 jail,</v>

278
00:08:25.941 --> 00:08:26.721
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck though?</v>

279
00:08:26.721 --> 00:08:27.680
<v Speaker 1>You've got to have a good time.</v>

280
00:08:27.681 --> 00:08:28.514
<v Speaker 1>You know</v>

281
00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:32.190
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to kick study Freddy.</v>

282
00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.010
<v Speaker 1>You're going to kick Jesus Christ</v>

283
00:08:35.730 --> 00:08:36.040
<v Speaker 1>brought,</v>

284
00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:39.170
<v Speaker 1>we would rob them once every six weeks and finally it ended.</v>

285
00:08:39.171 --> 00:08:40.220
<v Speaker 1>I didn't bring up the eight ball</v>

286
00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:43.670
<v Speaker 1>when that I just did his eight boy.</v>

287
00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:45.560
<v Speaker 1>He got pissed off at me and that was it.</v>

288
00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:46.910
<v Speaker 1>Shame on people.</v>

289
00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:49.520
<v Speaker 1>People are just silly when people take the time,</v>

290
00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:52.210
<v Speaker 1>knowledge that shit or we are in,</v>

291
00:08:52.211 --> 00:08:53.044
<v Speaker 1>no I don't.</v>

292
00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:54.171
<v Speaker 1>Well it's you know,</v>

293
00:08:54.171 --> 00:08:55.380
<v Speaker 1>but also no,</v>

295
00:08:55.831 --> 00:08:56.310
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

296
00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:57.930
<v Speaker 2>But it's also people on both ends.</v>

297
00:08:57.931 --> 00:09:01.380
<v Speaker 2>Like you choosing to get upset about some really ridiculous should read the</v>

298
00:09:01.381 --> 00:09:03.020
<v Speaker 2>tweet and you go to that person's page and you go,</v>

299
00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:03.863
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>

300
00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:08.100
<v Speaker 2>Once I read somebody tweet and I go to their main page,</v>

301
00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:09.390
<v Speaker 2>I get to put,</v>

302
00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:10.260
<v Speaker 2>I can add it right in.</v>

303
00:09:10.261 --> 00:09:10.770
<v Speaker 2>One Minute I go,</v>

00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:11.310
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>

305
00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:12.780
<v Speaker 2>I get where he was coming from.</v>

306
00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:14.430
<v Speaker 2>I understand why he said that.</v>

307
00:09:14.431 --> 00:09:15.151
<v Speaker 2>He's a musician.</v>

308
00:09:15.151 --> 00:09:16.410
<v Speaker 2>He's daddy's a politician.</v>

309
00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:17.640
<v Speaker 2>He sells this.</v>

310
00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:18.340
<v Speaker 2>He likes,</v>

311
00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:20.510
<v Speaker 2>like today somebody hit me and I ran.</v>

312
00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:21.690
<v Speaker 2>He was a poor riser fan.</v>

313
00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:22.350
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>

314
00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:23.470
<v Speaker 2>You're a fucking book.</v>

315
00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:24.270
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>

316
00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:25.830
<v Speaker 2>I've never met a Paul Riser Fan,</v>

317
00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:27.610
<v Speaker 2>so if you're a poor riser fan,</v>

318
00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:30.240
<v Speaker 2>shoot yourself in the fucking mouth right now.</v>

319
00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:32.810
<v Speaker 2>Once somebody said,</v>

320
00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:37.080
<v Speaker 2>if I go to some of these pains and I see like music and I know the music sucks,</v>

321
00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:40.350
<v Speaker 2>that's where it ends because of his choice of music sucks.</v>

322
00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:43.020
<v Speaker 2>That's what if I don't see fucking one of my three on there,</v>

323
00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:44.490
<v Speaker 2>like I'm going to people's that.</v>

324
00:09:44.491 --> 00:09:46.620
<v Speaker 2>There's two things I judge people.</v>

325
00:09:46.621 --> 00:09:48.330
<v Speaker 2>I don't judge people by money and not legit people.</v>

326
00:09:48.331 --> 00:09:49.230
<v Speaker 2>That music collection,</v>

327
00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:50.880
<v Speaker 2>by looking at your music collection,</v>

328
00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:55.660
<v Speaker 2>you don't have sabbath paranoid if you don't have the staples Zeplin too.</v>

329
00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:56.550
<v Speaker 2>Those are the staples.</v>

330
00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:58.360
<v Speaker 2>If you don't have a Zeppelin to,</v>

331
00:09:58.380 --> 00:09:59.100
<v Speaker 2>why are we here?</v>

332
00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:00.510
<v Speaker 2>Why not smoking dope with you?</v>

333
00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:03.000
<v Speaker 2>Why are you wasting my fucking time?</v>

334
00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:03.781
<v Speaker 2>I'm over here.</v>

335
00:10:03.781 --> 00:10:05.720
<v Speaker 2>You got like best Judy Granddad.</v>

336
00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:06.743
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>

337
00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:07.770
<v Speaker 2>That's and number two,</v>

338
00:10:07.771 --> 00:10:09.200
<v Speaker 2>when you open up some of these refrigerator,</v>

339
00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:10.140
<v Speaker 2>there's certain,</v>

340
00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:10.501
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

341
00:10:10.501 --> 00:10:11.220
<v Speaker 2>it's true.</v>

342
00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:12.540
<v Speaker 2>You opened that tells me everything.</v>

343
00:10:12.541 --> 00:10:13.560
<v Speaker 2>If you're a fucking mood,</v>

344
00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:14.413
<v Speaker 2>if you're a month,</v>

345
00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:16.070
<v Speaker 2>if I see like low and beer,</v>

346
00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:16.861

<v Speaker 2>I ain't never coming in.</v>

348
00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:19.090
<v Speaker 2>And I knew certain people that um,</v>

349
00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:22.170
<v Speaker 2>they have music laying around just because it's cool,</v>

350
00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:23.160
<v Speaker 2>but I'm tons of them.</v>

351
00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:28.160
<v Speaker 2>That's why the generation of people that want to say,</v>

352
00:10:28.411 --> 00:10:31.410
<v Speaker 2>and I know this and I don't hate you cause I'm kind of the same way,</v>

353
00:10:31.411 --> 00:10:34.560

354
00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:36.660
<v Speaker 2>They prefer to listen to,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I told you the one I had to his day and it was fucked up because my mother had</v>

749
00:22:00.281 --> 00:22:03.610
<v Speaker 2>just died and it was the first time a chick called me.</v>

750
00:22:03.611 --> 00:22:03.820
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

751
00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:05.470
<v Speaker 2>that was my first booty call ever.</v>

752
00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:07.120
<v Speaker 2>I had dated this girl before.</v>

753
00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:08.830
<v Speaker 2>She was a cheerleader at Franklin school.</v>

754
00:22:09.070 --> 00:22:11.890
<v Speaker 2>I played hoops at Mckinley and we had messed around a little bit.</v>

755
00:22:11.891 --> 00:22:12.790

760
00:22:17.381 --> 00:22:18.700

<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

763
00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:24.490
<v Speaker 2>And after my mother died,</v>

764
00:22:24.491 --> 00:22:28.060
<v Speaker 2>like I was home for a week and this lady was taking care of me and I get this</v>

00:22:39.411 --> 00:22:40.560
<v Speaker 2>You know she owned her own person.</v>

00:22:40.561 --> 00:22:40.781
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

778
00:22:40.781 --> 00:22:43.660

787
00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:56.973
<v Speaker 2>But I knew her.</v>

788
00:22:57.220 --> 00:22:59.860

892
00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:28.240
<v Speaker 2>When you leave a bar at night,</v>

893
00:26:28.241 --> 00:26:29.660
<v Speaker 2>when they close up right.</v>

894
00:26:30.010 --> 00:26:31.750
<v Speaker 2>They locked the bathroom and then they put like a,</v>

895
00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:33.540
<v Speaker 2>a lock or if you break in,</v>

00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:41.650
<v Speaker 2>We come back to have a drink.</v>

902
00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:44.130
<v Speaker 2>We'd open the bathroom and he'd come out like nothing.</v>

903
00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:44.791
<v Speaker 1>I swear to God,</v>

<v Speaker 1>He was hilarious.</v>

906
00:26:48.370 --> 00:26:50.460
<v Speaker 1>One day I put my Dick on a chair next to him.</v>

907
00:26:53.060 --> 00:26:54.280
<v Speaker 1>He was sitting at a Boston,</v>
