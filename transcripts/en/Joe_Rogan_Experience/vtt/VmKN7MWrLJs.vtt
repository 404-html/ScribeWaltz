00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:05.100
<v Speaker 1>Hello Rick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll talk to you when you're surviving</v>

2
00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.630
<v Speaker 1>animal food in plastic and then eat it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then poop it out and eat it later.</v>

3
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.590
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm take the plastic off and eat</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

4
00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.130
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like it could work.</v>

5
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.070
<v Speaker 1>That's a technique I've never thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you're going to be like on</v>

6
00:00:20.071 --> 00:00:22.320
<v Speaker 1>your own for five days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can eat a bunch of food but wrap it</v>

7
00:00:22.321 --> 00:00:24.180
<v Speaker 1>up in plastic and then later poop it</v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

8
00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.130
<v Speaker 1>Then untaken out with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then how would you get the nutrients</v>

9
00:00:26.131 --> 00:00:28.700
<v Speaker 1>from the food in the first place with</v>
<v Speaker 1>your stomach and a piece of plywood is</v>

10
00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.770
<v Speaker 1>this poop it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand it.</v>

11
00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:33.090
<v Speaker 1>And then you poop it out and like before</v>
<v Speaker 1>you leave for your trip,</v>

12
00:00:33.091 --> 00:00:36.390
<v Speaker 1>go to and go get stuffed like Boston</v>
<v Speaker 1>market or something.</v>

13
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.240
<v Speaker 1>Conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't ruin this when you're poorly</v>

14
00:00:39.241 --> 00:00:41.370
<v Speaker 1>thought out ideas and they get a bunch</v>
<v Speaker 1>of plastic.</v>

15
00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.470
<v Speaker 1>Don't tell him stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can't,</v>

16
00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.240
<v Speaker 1>can't tell you how to eat his poop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

17
00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.113
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

18
00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.040
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying like eat like on big meal</v>
<v Speaker 1>before you were about to leave.</v>

19
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.870
<v Speaker 1>He would eat his own food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's called the things called second</v>

20
00:00:54.871 --> 00:00:58.290
<v Speaker 1>harvest and then native American maybe</v>
<v Speaker 1>take a bunch of like protein bars,</v>

21
00:00:58.291 --> 00:00:59.700
<v Speaker 1>wrapped them up in plastic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eat it,</v>

22
00:00:59.701 --> 00:01:01.020
<v Speaker 1>and then poop it out in a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 1>days.</v>

23
00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.570
<v Speaker 1>Then unwrap the plastic they need what</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of shit you really think a fucking</v>

24
00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.610
<v Speaker 1>whole protein bar in plastic can make it</v>
<v Speaker 1>through your digestive tract and carry</v>

25
00:01:11.371 --> 00:01:14.410
<v Speaker 1>the bars in my backpack and just eat</v>
<v Speaker 1>them three days later,</v>

26
00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.880
<v Speaker 1>poorest understanding of the human</v>
<v Speaker 1>digestive tract ever exhibited on a</v>

27
00:01:17.881 --> 00:01:19.890
<v Speaker 1>podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was trying to figure out what you were</v>

28
00:01:19.891 --> 00:01:21.330
<v Speaker 1>saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought you were saying eating poop.</v>

29
00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.270
<v Speaker 1>You're not talking about a little Baggie</v>
<v Speaker 1>of heroin that a drug.</v>

30
00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.360
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to make you survive.</v>

31
00:01:27.361 --> 00:01:28.830
<v Speaker 1>You'll.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll get another hour's worth of</v>

32
00:01:28.831 --> 00:01:31.710
<v Speaker 1>energy from that little heroin bag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about Petite Finlaison?</v>

33
00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.260
<v Speaker 1>Eight ounces wrapped in plastic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to die.</v>

34
00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.790
<v Speaker 1>People get diverticulitis because they</v>
<v Speaker 1>get a fucking watermelon seed.</v>

35
00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.860
<v Speaker 1>Freaking word diverticulitis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she says signifies word.</v>

36
00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.980
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brock Lesnar for the UFC got diverted</v>

37
00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.710
<v Speaker 1>because I had a serious operation when</v>
<v Speaker 1>they removed 12 inches of his colon.</v>

38
00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.350
<v Speaker 1>Found out about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I looked into it and I thought it was</v>

39
00:01:55.351 --> 00:01:58.320
<v Speaker 1>just because of eating meat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Anthony Bourdain and informed me</v>

40
00:01:58.321 --> 00:02:01.200
<v Speaker 1>that you can eat a seed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you get like a sunflower seeds or</v>

41
00:02:01.201 --> 00:02:04.950
<v Speaker 1>something stuck inside your tract,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your digestive tract,</v>

42
00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.230
<v Speaker 1>and it starts an abscess and you get</v>
<v Speaker 1>sick.</v>

43
00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:08.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could.</v>

44
00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:10.920
<v Speaker 1>You can die from a fucking seed getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuck.</v>

45
00:02:10.921 --> 00:02:12.450
<v Speaker 1>He's like all kinds of stuff gets stuck</v>
<v Speaker 1>in there,</v>

46
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.600
<v Speaker 1>so it's not necessarily just protein.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's also contributed to the game is</v>

47
00:02:17.701 --> 00:02:21.870
<v Speaker 1>like a Gi track.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dr. Now you can't eat a petite filet</v>

48
00:02:21.871 --> 00:02:24.570
<v Speaker 1>minion should it out in the woods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all I'm saying.</v>

49
00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.800
<v Speaker 1>You gotta have to have a better strategy</v>
<v Speaker 1>than ever.</v>

50
00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.720
<v Speaker 1>I guess I was thinking survivor island,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like trying to find a way to cheat.</v>

51
00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.200
<v Speaker 1>You can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't carry it in your backpack.</v>

52
00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.750
<v Speaker 1>You'll know you're pregnant if you had</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough food for a day,</v>

53
00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.790
<v Speaker 1>all the food backed up with your body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What can a calorie consumption are you</v>

54
00:02:41.791 --> 00:02:42.550
