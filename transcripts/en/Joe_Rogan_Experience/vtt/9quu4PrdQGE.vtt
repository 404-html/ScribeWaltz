00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:05.100
Two one and we're live.
Ladies and gentlemen,

2
00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.080
this is a fight companion podcast.
What that means is if you've tuned in,

3
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.440
hoping to hear enlightening conversation or facts about the universe or ancient

4
00:00:15.721 --> 00:00:19.200
civilizations,
Ron,
he comes to the wrong place pitches.

5
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.560
This is a bunch of people that shouldn't be awake but are awake.

6
00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.750
5:00 AM I'm with a j Buddha,
Aka Eddie Bravo.

7
00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.870
Kill a bee.
Ben Saunders is up in this bitch.
What's happening?

8
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.730
And then of course Brendan Motherfucking Shop,
Aka Big Brown,

9
00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.220
Aka big,
Brown sexy.
And uh,

10
00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:47.140
we here watching the UFC live from North Korea and the first fight is about to

11
00:00:47.141 --> 00:00:50.760
happen Sam Sicilia versus do Ho choice.

12
00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.500
I think it's Che.
I think they pronounce it Che.
Um,
but uh,

13
00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.410
so if you've never heard these podcasts before,

14
00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.770
what we do is we get together and we just watched the fights and we talk shit

15
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:02.640
and a,

16
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.290
we do a lot of the MMA world's journalism for them cause a lot of them,

17
00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.210
they rely on us for stories.

18
00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.870
<v 1>What one,
those bitches are out there right now.
They're just waiting right now.</v>

19
00:01:14.871 --> 00:01:18.490
And we see pencils in their heads.
So tired,
cheeto fingers,

20
00:01:18.491 --> 00:01:21.340
just fucking one.
One day,

21
00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.790
this is one day when I'm tired of traveling,
this is what we're going to do.

22
00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.770
This was fucking tough,
dude.
That was a hard one.
So I have a long ass day.

23
00:01:29.771 --> 00:01:33.670
I gotta go to San Diego and teach a seminar.
And then after that seminar I got,

24
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.980
uh,
a friend of mine asked me to be in a music video.
So I'm doing that too,

25
00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:45.810
like the chick from Whitesnake.

26
00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:51.520
So last night I decided the only way I'm going to be able to pull this off is if

27
00:01:51.521 --> 00:01:53.150
I go to sleep like at eight,
and like,

28
00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.780
how the fuck am I going to go to sleep at eight?
I had a couple of ambiance,

29
00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.960
so I took one ambien and I took it like around six 30 and I'm like feeling kind

30
00:02:01.201 --> 00:02:04.900
of loopy.
And then he calls me,
he goes,
hey dude,
do you have another ambient?

31
00:02:04.901 --> 00:02:06.310
I'm not gonna be able to sleep.
I'm like,
fuck,

32
00:02:06.311 --> 00:02:10.060
you gonna have to drive over to my house.
He says,
Ben comes over,
Ben comes over,

33
00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:13.860
by the time he comes over,
I'm fucking out.
He's not,

34
00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:19.570
he's testing [inaudible] wake up two hours later,

35
00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.370
I look at the text,
he's long,
God,

36
00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.970
you must be out.
So I call him back.
I'm like,
Fuck Dude,
I'm sorry.

37
00:02:33.971 --> 00:02:37.630
That ambien just crushed me.
So then he came back.
Did you actually come back?

38
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.780
Yeah,
I left it in my mailbox and uh,

39
00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.750
but from that point on I couldn't go back to sleep.

40
00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.540
I'm just sitting there and then I got really,

41
00:02:46.541 --> 00:02:51.190
really medicated drowsy and then that was weird being all loopy on Ambien and

42
00:02:51.191 --> 00:02:53.380
then stoned at the same time.
Dude,

43
00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.260
I was breaking down some shit from when I was 15 like shit,

44
00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.130
I was bringing back memories.
I never thought,

45
00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:05.080
<v 0>I'm like holy.
It was shut up all God damn night.
I didn't really get any sleep,</v>

46
00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.940
so I don't know how I'm going to do this.
I really don't.
Just hang in there baby.

47
00:03:09.941 --> 00:03:14.610
He'd be fine.
Yeah.
That's good.

48
00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:17.240
How long did you wait out?
Hey,
do you know what news?

49
00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.810
Do you know what new were out?
Do you know what new vigil is?
Eddie?
New Vigil.

50
00:03:22.811 --> 00:03:26.650
You ever heard of new vigil?
Some shit that fighter pilot's take.
It's uh,

51
00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.340
it's something that,
um,
like they,
they,

52
00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:33.970
I think they're official use for it is for people that have narcolepsy,
but it's,

53
00:03:33.971 --> 00:03:37.450
um,
it's like a pill that helps you stay awake.
Like when you're really tired,

54
00:03:37.451 --> 00:03:42.430
but it's not like speed.
It's real weird.
So notch understood.
But yeah,

55
00:03:42.431 --> 00:03:45.770
we'll talk about some of that.
I know a dude.
I don't what,

56
00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.500
that's going to be a hard fuck.
I gotta drive two hours after this homie.

57
00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.010
You got this little costs.
We got plenty of these,
these caveman coffee,

58
00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:59.080
one of these little fuckers has 240 milligrams of caffeine and that was,

59
00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.830
that's a nicer than what I just drank.
Right?
Yeah.
Well,
no,
that's just coffee.

60
00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.830
It's pretty,
it is,
but it's not one of these nitro things.
Just

61
00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:10.450
espresso shot.

62
00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.860
It's like a double espresso or a triple espresso with some fucking nitrogen.

63
00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.820
I don't know.
To try to explain to me how the Guinness of Toffee,
right.

64
00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.860
This is a whole box.
Oh,
I love them.

65
00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:28.000
I love these nitros but they're fucking super strong.
Like the rocket fuel.

66
00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:33.280
240 is like a Venti Starbucks and it's all in this one little,
can Jim fuck,

67
00:04:33.281 --> 00:04:35.860
how much is in a rock star?
Like one of those regular sized cans?

68
00:04:35.861 --> 00:04:39.510
A good question because they break those bitches up and serving.

69
00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.170
Do not consume all in one day and shit.
Dude,
you ever drank all those red lines?

70
00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:47.620
Yes.
Those red lines.
I swear I was going to have a heart attack.

71
00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:51.190
My heart was like a hummingbird man.
I'll never do it again.
Here we go.

72
00:04:51.191 --> 00:04:56.170
Sam Cecillia Samsung cell.
You hit so hard.

73
00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:01.130
That dude is,
he's an interesting character.
He's super game.
Sam Cecillia

74
00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:10.990
tag.
We'll do that.
Good works for the birds.
Did you uh,

75
00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:13.720
think everybody up with this or no,
I haven't.
Thank you Eddie.

76
00:05:13.721 --> 00:05:18.721
Four minutes and 28 seconds right now of the first round with,

77
00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:20.980
I think like I said,
it's,

78
00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:24.840
it's spelled Troye but I think it's chick Christ.

79
00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:30.430
See Sam Cecillia brings the thunder man.
I do.
It's fun.
The hell.
Yeah.
This is fun.

80
00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:34.810
Oh Man.
Apricots.
He fights like with his hands,
way low,

81
00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:37.110
way low,
and then you can just pass that joint around.

82
00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:38.490
I'm not mad at you should do that.

83
00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:44.480
And he's sitting there like he's smoking like a soul cafe cafe somewhere.

84
00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:49.890
I told him so petty that you know isn't not the petty of today.

85
00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:54.970
Does it lose it?
Oh Shit.
I tell you.

86
00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:58.070
Oh,
snaps this spike brown.
He want some of this.
I know.
I'm

87
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:02.880
<v 2>good man.
Scared of things could get weird.
I smoked that weird.
Do you want,</v>

88
00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:07.580
you want the headlines?
Let me smoke the house.
Let me smell it.

89
00:06:07.581 --> 00:06:11.260
That at least the house.
We haven't talked publicly since the Rhonda fight.
No,

90
00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:14.270
we have.
Oh dammit.

91
00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:18.680
Enjoy that flight back to this day.
Oh my God.
He got cracked.
Fuck.

92
00:06:18.681 --> 00:06:22.370
That was a crunk fight.
There was wild for the first round.

93
00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:27.680
I'm not magic guys.
Turtle Neck and Korea.
Damn those people.

94
00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:29.750
Let me super psyched.

95
00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:34.410
A Korean guy wants to Korea and knocked the fuck racist Cilia.
No,
they like it.

96
00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:37.850
Hell yeah.
It's not racist.
It's okay to be racist like at sporting events,
right?

97
00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:41.930
No,
it's not okay to be racist,
but you can be proud to be from a country.
Exactly.

98
00:06:41.931 --> 00:06:45.930
You can hate the other guy since he's not from your country.
That was when,
um,

99
00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:49.460
I forget who it was,
but when,
um,
uh,

100
00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:54.200
what the fuck is his name?
God dammit.
Mike Pie was fighting.

101
00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:56.180
I'm trying to remember his name.
Uh,

102
00:06:56.181 --> 00:07:00.950
he fought this cat in Brazil and a Funche I think it was fun and he knocked him

103
00:07:00.951 --> 00:07:05.660
out and uh,
it was just a straight clean victory.

104
00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:09.860
Everything is good.
No poor sportsmanship.
Everything was great.
Said Nice things,

105
00:07:09.861 --> 00:07:12.740
the post fight interview,
but all they're doing is chanting something.

106
00:07:12.741 --> 00:07:15.830
The whole crowd's chanting something.
I can't figure out what their Channing,

107
00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:18.380
so I asked the translator and he says,

108
00:07:18.381 --> 00:07:23.120
they're basically chanting the Brazilian version of you're a faggot.

109
00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:26.390
Oh Damn.
The whole crowd,
the whole crowd,

110
00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:29.980
like 15 to Brazil doesn't fuck around.
When I,

111
00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:35.090
when I forgot Nogueira crowd was chanting wants the same thing.
They're chanting.

112
00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:37.670
One day I was like,
damn,
I'm old.
Fuck it.
Hit out here man.

113
00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:42.290
I turned her on to my coach speaks Portuguese.
I go where they say and he's like,

114
00:07:42.291 --> 00:07:44.780
you really want to know?
I'm like,
fuck yeah.
He goes,
they're chanting,

115
00:07:44.781 --> 00:07:49.570
you're going to die.
I was like,
God,
dog.
That's intense because that's her thing.

116
00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:52.390
[inaudible] that's where lax on that.

117
00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:57.030
Imagine if the American crowds are chanting that that guy looks like a star

118
00:07:57.031 --> 00:08:00.770
craft champion.
He looks like a dude who would,

119
00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:05.120
you know beat your ass at some new video game.
He doesn't look very guy.
Well,
no,

120
00:08:05.121 --> 00:08:07.050
he fucks him.
Sam Cecillia by knock.

121
00:08:07.051 --> 00:08:09.760
He looks like he's just a beast with the Rubik's cube or some shit.

122
00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:13.610
I'd like when dudes are unassuming like that,
but are murderers like,
hi,

123
00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:18.290
I know Kenny Florida,
like Kenny the type dude you would fuck with in a bar.

124
00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:23.210
Right?
He's small,
huge head,
sexy beard launch.

125
00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:27.020
Fuck.
What the fuck are you with your watch kid?
He's been through some shit.

126
00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:31.950
You're fucking watch and your nice tie asshole loses his whole face.

127
00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:35.330
Fuck,
fuck you up man.
I know.

128
00:08:35.331 --> 00:08:38.780
He's like the most unassuming ass kicker.
He looks like an accountant,

129
00:08:38.781 --> 00:08:40.700
but he will jack your world up,
man.

130
00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:44.120
You would just realize like really early on,

131
00:08:44.121 --> 00:08:49.121
what a mistake it was when you started jab like,

132
00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:51.560
Oh shit,
this guy does he get to fuck.

133
00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:56.010
I had a buddy of mine who um,
work a,
he was a bouncer

134
00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:58.710
<v 1>at a strip club and he was a purple belt under hoists.</v>

135
00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:01.130
This is back in the late nineties.
And he was a,

136
00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:04.590
he was a dickhead and he would go out and start fights and he would go out with

137
00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:09.690
a knee pads on and ties and he would work with ties.
It were velcro.

138
00:09:09.691 --> 00:09:12.870
You just pull them off and he's ready to go psycho.
Yeah,
he is.

139
00:09:12.871 --> 00:09:15.060
He's a psycho and he fucked people up really easy.

140
00:09:15.061 --> 00:09:17.990
I've seen him fuck people up at the Strip club.
Like it just like,

141
00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:22.920
just like in Gracie and action.
Take the dude down.
His guard easily mount to me,

142
00:09:22.921 --> 00:09:26.970
gives us back,
chokes him out.
And uh,
he walked up,
he,
he,

143
00:09:26.971 --> 00:09:30.060
he did that to some guy right in front of me and said,
that's all you got.

144
00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:32.580
And then he stands,
it goes nice fight asshole.

145
00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:37.350
He was all mad because it was too easy.
That's his amateur record man.

146
00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:40.440
But he had some road rage and he flipped some dude off and do flipped him off

147
00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:43.470
and he pulled over and he fought some guy and he said it went on for like 20

148
00:09:43.471 --> 00:09:44.131
minutes goes man.

149
00:09:44.131 --> 00:09:49.131
The dude knew Jujitsu was fucking hard it because I think he won [inaudible]

150
00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:54.683
minutes

151
00:09:57.220 --> 00:10:01.800
stuff back and forth.
Barn burner,
right?

152
00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:04.020
No Mace.
No.
We're just all clenched up probably,

153
00:10:04.021 --> 00:10:06.390
you know on the ground and the dirt just clinched up with problems.

154
00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:09.090
This guy knows how to fight.
This goes to loose a blue belt.

155
00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:11.860
You start talking to them at that point.
Come on bitch,
what are you training?

156
00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:16.060
If you get to a good spot,
we have card.

157
00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:25.380
Everybody knows her.
[inaudible] what does this sport,
what is it?

158
00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:29.490
What is the name of the push street sports in Santa Monica.
CanNot the mog.

159
00:10:29.491 --> 00:10:30.780
No old school

160
00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:36.000
is calling out to all his friends in the starcraft clan.

161
00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:40.890
We still meet for Land Party,
Dude.

162
00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:44.580
The thing is that high surgery,
why?
Oh,

163
00:10:44.581 --> 00:10:49.080
you mean that thing with your eyes that they tried to an Americanized,
right.

164
00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:54.570
It's so normal.
They're super normal.
It's not really craft champion.

165
00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:57.150
It's like chicks with fake tinnitus.

166
00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:00.390
It's like having your period with Jamie put up on the big screen on the little

167
00:11:00.391 --> 00:11:02.080
screen on the left.
That's a,

168
00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:05.520
let's do like the best video game play in the world or some shit and starcraft

169
00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:09.180
champion.
Yeah.
That's the starcraft champion.
Look at Korean Zombie.

170
00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:14.010
I forgot about him.
He's military.
Two years.
Mandatory military service.

171
00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:17.730
You don't fuck around man.
It's almost over though,
right?
I think so.

172
00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:21.180
You know that's an interesting thought in the military right there.
Yeah,
he is.

173
00:11:21.181 --> 00:11:24.350
He's got a suit on military,
so he does kidding.

174
00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:29.670
She was rolling with that role.
I'm sure he's still training.
No,

175
00:11:29.671 --> 00:11:32.400
I didn't see it was a viral role.

176
00:11:32.401 --> 00:11:35.400
Ben Henderson and the Korean Zombie and when was this?
How long ago?

177
00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:38.820
A couple of days ago.
It's all over the net.
This was he is he out here?

178
00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:42.180
The Korean Zombie Puts Ben Henderson in a twister,

179
00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:46.670
but he escapes and then pin hips and comes back and meat hooks.
The Shin,

180
00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:50.090
rubber guards this shit out of him.
Sick and puts them into Omoplata.

181
00:11:51.490 --> 00:11:54.460
Yeah.
How's this capsule?
How Berto,
MENA,

182
00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:56.890
<v 2>how's this guy?
11 to know undefeated.</v>

183
00:11:57.230 --> 00:12:00.010
Why did I nasty as trying to remember when I saw it?
Yeah,

184
00:12:00.011 --> 00:12:03.160
it's a beautiful moment.
I'm not mad at.
So where have I seen him fight before?

185
00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:05.200
They're trying to figure out who he fought.

186
00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:09.340
Do Korean zombies walk out when he comes out to crane bay?
Oh here it is.

187
00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:13.690
There it is.
Up on the screen.
Koreans.
Oh yeah,
there it is.

188
00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:16.420
And where were you guys?
Damn,
Jamie's on fire.

189
00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:19.180
Look at their video taping this role.
Like it's some serious shit.

190
00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:24.430
A bunch of people there.
Right?
Look at that.
That's like Abu Dhabi.

191
00:12:24.431 --> 00:12:28.720
You're going to put cameras on there.
You can't just roll light.
It's a real shit.

192
00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:32.440
Now they kind of did cause he kinda like gave him a triangle.

193
00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:36.400
I don't think it's as though this isn't the role I saw or it's a different angle

194
00:12:37.510 --> 00:12:40.740
too.
Didn't have gloves.
This wasn't the,
Oh,
they're just messing around here.
Yeah,

195
00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:42.950
this ain't the one,
Jamie.

196
00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:47.610
God dammit you.
That's some bullshit.

197
00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:50.560
So they're just sort of a slap it on each other.

198
00:12:50.561 --> 00:12:55.240
They're just a nice sweat for Ben for Fight Week,
Huh?
Oh,
uh,
if,

199
00:12:55.241 --> 00:12:58.720
uh,
if you were Ron as head coach,

200
00:12:59.050 --> 00:13:02.230
how would you have her train for the rematch?
And what'd you do?

201
00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:06.550
She was going to listen to you.
She was all in your hands.

202
00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:10.930
What would you tell her?
This is what you gotta do is on Mba.
Oh God.

203
00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:13.440
I thought we were talking about

204
00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:18.930
you guys are [inaudible] with the interview question.

205
00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:24.690
Interview question.
Stone cold.
Hey,
you know,
you used to date this girl,

206
00:13:24.691 --> 00:13:28.320
she's,
you know,
whatever,
the superstar athlete,
whatever,
whatever.

207
00:13:28.410 --> 00:13:31.060
How would you train it bro?
You too,
Bro.

208
00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:34.230
I'll tell you what's interesting is people think it's that easy.

209
00:13:34.231 --> 00:13:37.080
We can just go find another striking coach and everything.

210
00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:40.460
It doesn't work like that.
Of course not.
But what would you do you have,

211
00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:44.480
do you have six months?
What'd you do,
six months of strategy be?

212
00:13:44.510 --> 00:13:47.800
And what would the training be like?
Well,
listen man,
six months you,

213
00:13:47.801 --> 00:13:52.110
you need to cut out all the drama in your life.
Probably find a new coach and uh,

214
00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:55.770
just focus on what you do because she's never going to out strike Holly.

215
00:13:55.771 --> 00:13:59.220
That's never happening in this world ever.
Even if you gave her two years.

216
00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:02.460
So do what you do.
You don't need to read,
reinvent the wheel,

217
00:14:02.461 --> 00:14:05.430
but your best chance of winning is by grappling.

218
00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:08.670
So you're not going to invest your whole time trying to compete with a world

219
00:14:08.671 --> 00:14:11.470
class striker.
So what would you do?
You'd hook her up with the rest of them.
Call,

220
00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:15.120
try it and just all the commercial,
just see a Rhonda,
no more focused,

221
00:14:15.121 --> 00:14:16.650
met commercials with all that Shit.

222
00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:19.110
They should just be wrestling and double light commercial.

223
00:14:20.370 --> 00:14:23.010
That's where the UFC and her camp fucked up.

224
00:14:23.011 --> 00:14:25.950
Kept everyone kept calling Mike Tyson.
She had her striking with Mike Tyson,

225
00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:28.110
I guess,
man,
I guess so.

226
00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:32.560
So she has this striking Mike Tyson.
She had that Mike Tyson or,

227
00:14:32.561 --> 00:14:36.060
because she kept greeting girls but agree because everyone was so sold on the

228
00:14:36.061 --> 00:14:39.870
striking,
including me.
I thought she looked real good against Batchko hail.

229
00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:44.850
But batch go hand is like more of a brawler style.
And when,
when Holly,

230
00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:47.940
when,
when Ronda comes like super aggressive like that,

231
00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:51.050
that'll work on a lot of girls that'll fold under that pressure.
All of,

232
00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:54.340
but Holly,
Holly just rose to the,

233
00:14:54.341 --> 00:14:57.380
he's the only one who's had real perfect foot work.

234
00:14:57.620 --> 00:15:01.190
And the way the fight started when Ron Ron is that they're looking at each other

235
00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:04.930
and hall,
he just kept skipping to the left,
skipping to the right,
skipping,

236
00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:07.250
skipping of the right.
No one's ever done that to her.

237
00:15:07.251 --> 00:15:10.360
She was doing look at my foot,
but I'm just going to be damned if you watch it.

238
00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:12.690
You notice that she did that from the moment she entered the ox

239
00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:18.970
four.
If you watch Holly's previous sites swishy or boxing fights or championship

240
00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:20.420
fights,
she didn't do before.

241
00:15:20.421 --> 00:15:24.770
But if you do your research on the Hollywood,
you know,

242
00:15:24.771 --> 00:15:28.190
I'm a victim of it too.
I was like,
yeah,
I,
I thought Rhonda was going to win.

243
00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:32.120
Didn't I say on this podcast?
I go,
dude,
Rhonda didn't,

244
00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:35.720
I dunno what I said word for word,
but I did.
I did say that.
Uh,

245
00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:38.630
I didn't see Adam predict shit.
No,
no one did.
No one fucking

246
00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:43.910
hilarious is how many people are talking shit.

247
00:15:43.911 --> 00:15:46.940
Now I know there's so,
there's so mean about it,

248
00:15:46.941 --> 00:15:51.080
but like you didn't see this common way to go shop.
Wait,

249
00:15:51.081 --> 00:15:55.970
good call on that one.
Oh my patterning hold the fucking huge upset in the UFC.

250
00:15:56.540 --> 00:16:01.220
The amount of fucking means,
oh my gosh.
She broke the internet crazy.

251
00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:05.150
She's only been doing Stan or she's only been doing MMA for four years.

252
00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:07.850
Like a little more than four years.
He shouldn't have life experience,

253
00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:12.980
which is nuts because she's 34 right?
It's true.
Oh,

254
00:16:12.981 --> 00:16:13.880
you were talking about Holly Holm.

255
00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:16.640
We see the amount of fights that she's had though.

256
00:16:16.650 --> 00:16:21.350
Boxing and kickboxing and then you see that footwork and those combos that she

257
00:16:21.351 --> 00:16:23.750
landed in that fight like man,
she,

258
00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:27.160
she had a split decision victory over a cow,
Paddington.

259
00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:31.430
It was so real close fight and so that she goes from that fight to the Marion

260
00:16:31.431 --> 00:16:33.050
were no fight,
which is a really good fight.

261
00:16:33.051 --> 00:16:35.240
She looked good in that fight and then this fight,

262
00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:38.960
she's just looked like a world beater.
I think just,
you know,

263
00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:41.680
fight through all about matchup study as,
and I think,

264
00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:45.140
I think Amanda and Holly fight a hundred times.

265
00:16:45.290 --> 00:16:49.640
Holly probably wins at least 95 I just think style wise it's a bad match up.

266
00:16:49.650 --> 00:16:53.240
So I don't think so.
If she focused like she did on her striking,
keep working,

267
00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:56.180
striking.
She's still got obviously a lot to work on,

268
00:16:56.450 --> 00:17:01.450
but she's got a really take her wrestling to the highest possible levels per

269
00:17:01.521 --> 00:17:04.310
shits on the ground.
You got to get the fight to the ground.

270
00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:08.210
You can't make it a kick,
but he's never been taken yet.
You got to wrestle,

271
00:17:08.211 --> 00:17:11.590
wrestle and if you can't wrestle then we got to pull guard Holly's.

272
00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:18.740
Yeah,
maybe that's it.
That's it.

273
00:17:19.370 --> 00:17:22.220
There's only three choices you could strike with her.

274
00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:25.580
You could try to take her down if those two don't work because the strike is not

275
00:17:25.581 --> 00:17:27.380
going to work and if the rest of them don't work,

276
00:17:27.530 --> 00:17:31.120
all you have left is pulling guard.
Good luck.
Why is that?

277
00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:35.300
It's Holly Holm submitted in some anti guard pulling.
She has a,
she works.

278
00:17:35.301 --> 00:17:37.820
She works very hard on grappling it and know what I'm saying is,

279
00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:40.580
is she a master at an Tigard pulling?

280
00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:45.020
You said good luck trying to good luck cause there's Rhonda Mastered Guard.

281
00:17:45.021 --> 00:17:49.590
Polar does Rhonda back.
She'd have to figure out how to do it all.
You got to,

282
00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:52.150
it's because you shoot

283
00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:59.460
all the time.
It's not that hard.
That's his thing.
Exactly.

284
00:17:59.461 --> 00:18:02.580
She's got to make it her thing.
She's got to get the fight to the ground.

285
00:18:02.610 --> 00:18:04.800
If the wrestling ain't going to work,
if the judo ain't going to work,

286
00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:07.050
what do you,
what else do you have left?
Stand with her.

287
00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:09.060
That's already not going to work.
So you only join.

288
00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:12.490
He only joined the rounds are took our employee.
There's

289
00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:16.860
no one cared.
People that expect it.
Ryan Hall to do it when right.

290
00:18:16.861 --> 00:18:20.010
All pull guard and he tapped two dudes out by pulling guard.

291
00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:21.470
It happens all the time.
That's how.

292
00:18:21.610 --> 00:18:24.350
How's it working for Ryan Hall on the ultimate fighter though?
No,

293
00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:29.280
he lost his last fight.
You know what?
When I was really impressive.
Ryan Hall is,

294
00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:34.470
Matt is a striking and his foot work pretty damn legit man.

295
00:18:34.471 --> 00:18:37.560
It's getting better.
It's getting better.
Yeah.
If he just keeps going,

296
00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:39.960
Ryan Hall could be a serious threat.

297
00:18:40.170 --> 00:18:43.610
His strikings on its way to being pretty damn good and,

298
00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:45.200
and my fucking opinion,

299
00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:47.670
what do I know I could Jeet Kun doe for two and a half years.

300
00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:52.110
I think you definitely a right about her needing more options for being able to

301
00:18:52.111 --> 00:18:52.980
take guys down.

302
00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:56.130
It's a question of like how long would it take for her to pick up those other

303
00:18:56.131 --> 00:18:58.470
options because she's always looking for the same thing.

304
00:18:58.471 --> 00:19:02.100
She's always looking for the clinch and up until now that's all she's had to do.

305
00:19:02.310 --> 00:19:04.980
She clenches with girls and she's just a superior grappler.

306
00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:09.000
She wants a hip toss and them throwing them on the ground in spectacular
fashion,

307
00:19:09.001 --> 00:19:11.160
beating their ass and arm Barnum and that's what she's been doing.

308
00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:15.540
But if you can't do that,
and she didn't have those other options.

309
00:19:15.610 --> 00:19:20.540
I tried out for doubles.
I mean does she,
does she ever do that?
[inaudible]

310
00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:24.940
you know she's been doing judo since she's was in a diaper,
right?

311
00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:29.410
Her knees aren't great either.
You know,
she said to me,
so for say,
okay,
now,

312
00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:32.010
now go freestyle,
wrestle.
Let me know how that goes.

313
00:19:32.610 --> 00:19:34.460
Try and fucking freestyle wrestle.
Holly Holm.

314
00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:39.510
If everyone has all these kind of ideas on what she should do,
it's tough man.

315
00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:42.000
So you lose your eye.
What would you think?

316
00:19:42.001 --> 00:19:43.890
Would you think she has to do what she's always done,

317
00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:47.460
but just do it better and more focused?
You got to do what got you to the dance.

318
00:19:47.461 --> 00:19:51.180
I think you take out the negativity in your life.
You get a coach who's,

319
00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:54.840
who's going to support you and you put worldclass string around you and you

320
00:19:54.841 --> 00:19:58.590
bring to what got you to the dance.
You don't try to cross the hobby type coach,

321
00:19:58.620 --> 00:20:00.040
right?
Matt Hume.

322
00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:06.130
You come up with someone Delphia Greg Jackson.
Cause that's how it,
you know,

323
00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:06.781
that's her guy.

324
00:20:06.781 --> 00:20:10.680
But you need someone to come up with a game plan where we're going to take your

325
00:20:10.681 --> 00:20:14.040
tools that have got you to this point and we're going to try to implement that

326
00:20:14.041 --> 00:20:17.040
with the Lilly because right now that's not happening right now.

327
00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:20.370
Right now the game plan,
uh,
dash forward and let's try and get her arm.

328
00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:23.580
But you know,
fuck man,
when Dana talked about,
he was like,
if it ain't broke,

329
00:20:23.581 --> 00:20:26.430
don't fix it.
Like that's how he was looking at the fucking at our training,

330
00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:29.160
you know?
And I'm like,
I get that up until now.

331
00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:31.800
But now you look at that fight and he got to go.
Okay,

332
00:20:31.801 --> 00:20:35.250
well there's obviously Holly has a way in.
I mean,

333
00:20:35.251 --> 00:20:39.110
and Holly has a pretty clear path to victory countering if,

334
00:20:39.130 --> 00:20:42.270
if Rhonda keeps going forward like she did in that fight,

335
00:20:42.410 --> 00:20:44.460
how you will keep cowering or to the end of time,

336
00:20:44.490 --> 00:20:48.430
I think what Ron and needs to do is look around and anyone,
including Dana,

337
00:20:48.450 --> 00:20:51.640
it says,
no,
you're good.
Just keep doing what you're doing.
Fuck you.
See Ya.

338
00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:52.750
I need to change this up.

339
00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:56.410
Tom Surrounded by yes men and everyone thinks everything's all good and everyone

340
00:20:56.411 --> 00:20:59.800
that goes,
no,
she didn't get hurt in the fight.
There's no concussion.
Oh God,

341
00:20:59.890 --> 00:21:04.090
fuck are you talking about who said she got line?
Who said there's no concussion?

342
00:21:04.091 --> 00:21:08.890
Who has a lot?
A lot of people
they go,
no injuries.

343
00:21:10.170 --> 00:21:13.180
Cause I saw,
I get fucking flatline.
She checked it.

344
00:21:13.181 --> 00:21:16.240
She got so anyone who says no,
no,
everything's all good.

345
00:21:16.241 --> 00:21:19.180
You don't need to change anything.
That should be an indicator for her to go.

346
00:21:19.181 --> 00:21:21.760
All right,
you're out of the crew.
I think technically maybe,

347
00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:24.370
maybe there's some personal issues and stuff,

348
00:21:24.371 --> 00:21:27.250
but technically she hasn't been striking that lung.

349
00:21:27.251 --> 00:21:30.520
So technically she's at a great spot with their striking.

350
00:21:30.521 --> 00:21:35.340
She lost because of pride and strategy.
That's it.
Whoa,
Whoa,
whoa.

351
00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:37.660
Hold on,
hold on.
Hold on.
Why you say sweaty?
Say Pride.

352
00:21:37.690 --> 00:21:40.150
Because she wanted to get up there and throw down.
She didn't,

353
00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:44.580
she didn't win when she clearly lost round one,
she didn't come out thinking

354
00:21:46.690 --> 00:21:48.580
she had no other option.
She goes already lit up.

355
00:21:48.610 --> 00:21:52.450
You also got to realize this isn't like a buster Douglas,
Mike Tyson.

356
00:21:52.451 --> 00:21:57.220
You what I'm saying?
Like she,
she just didn't get clipped.
She got out classed.

357
00:21:57.430 --> 00:22:01.420
It was even close.
He looked cheek approach.
She was down to strike with it.

358
00:22:01.421 --> 00:22:04.180
She got lit up when she was,
she has to be.
She was like,

359
00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:09.430
I'm sure the game.
Oh No,
no.

360
00:22:09.431 --> 00:22:11.890
After she tried taking her down,
then it's like,
fuck man,

361
00:22:11.891 --> 00:22:14.890
I have to stand with this guy and that's your only option.

362
00:22:14.891 --> 00:22:17.230
What did you think about the advice that she was getting in her corner?

363
00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:19.940
She didn't back up.
She went full.

364
00:22:19.941 --> 00:22:23.740
It's tough to say because you're talking about pride,
you know what I mean?

365
00:22:23.741 --> 00:22:26.560
A prime,
maybe not in a bad way.
You know?

366
00:22:26.561 --> 00:22:28.960
Maybe even a ten eight round like she got fund up.

367
00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.170
You and your coach because you're doing great.
This is exactly where we want her.

368
00:22:32.770 --> 00:22:35.440
What the fuck?
What are you talking about man?

369
00:22:35.730 --> 00:22:37.740
What the fuck are you going straight again?
For sure.

370
00:22:37.741 --> 00:22:41.980
That's when you're surrounded by yes.
Men.
Sony's looking,
I'm like,
fuck man.

371
00:22:42.010 --> 00:22:45.070
I listen.
We need footwork.
Control the distance.

372
00:22:45.210 --> 00:22:48.340
Try it and get your underhook and go to work,
but what you're doing right now,

373
00:22:48.430 --> 00:22:51.370
don't rush in there with your hands down and your jaw wide open,

374
00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:53.200
you're going to get kicked in your face.

375
00:22:53.410 --> 00:22:57.640
Do you think that she was just so dominant that no one around her thought this

376
00:22:57.641 --> 00:23:00.260
could ever happen?
Do you think that's a possibility?
Yes.

377
00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:02.830
I think everyone including uh,
you know,

378
00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:07.060
a ton of people in our circle thought there's no way this could ever happen.

379
00:23:07.061 --> 00:23:08.470
She can get away with whatever she wants.

380
00:23:08.530 --> 00:23:12.370
When the first round ended and she looked tired,

381
00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:16.540
like what do you think that that tired is from the beating that she took in that

382
00:23:16.541 --> 00:23:18.090
round?
Or do you think it's,

383
00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:21.730
is it a combination or is it being out of shape because it having too many

384
00:23:21.731 --> 00:23:25.090
distractions?
No,
I,
the one thing about Rhonda is no Ma you,

385
00:23:25.091 --> 00:23:28.720
she could be filming eight movies and she's going to come in shape.

386
00:23:28.721 --> 00:23:31.990
That's one thing she can control herself.
She's a monster.

387
00:23:31.991 --> 00:23:34.300
Her work ethic is like no one else's.

388
00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:36.640
So I don't think it's a matter of for being not shape.

389
00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:41.530
I just think for the first time she's like,
man,
I got fucked up.

390
00:23:41.650 --> 00:23:44.860
And that's a different feeling because your,
your adrenaline's pumping.

391
00:23:44.861 --> 00:23:45.890
You're getting fucked up

392
00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:48.560
<v 0>chasing a girl.
So I just don't think she's ever been.</v>

393
00:23:48.561 --> 00:23:51.740
Then they isolated in the truck.
They isolated this one elbow.

394
00:23:52.370 --> 00:23:54.470
She hit Rhonda with where Rhonda is moving forward.

395
00:23:54.471 --> 00:23:57.350
She steps in and left elbows are on the chin.
It's like,

396
00:23:57.800 --> 00:24:00.620
I can't believe she didn't break her job because we seen that first round her

397
00:24:00.621 --> 00:24:04.240
mouth wide open,
which I've never seen and usually that's a broken job,

398
00:24:04.250 --> 00:24:06.290
but are you sure it's not broken?

399
00:24:06.291 --> 00:24:08.330
Because that was the big room and that keeps going around.

400
00:24:08.331 --> 00:24:12.650
It's a huge room and then he's really,
we see her,
I didn't see it,
but I hear she,

401
00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:14.660
when she got off the plane from lax,

402
00:24:14.661 --> 00:24:17.700
you know there's pop Razzi she's covering her face.
Right.

403
00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:21.860
We'd seen her face get busted up and she probably didn't want to talk to them.

404
00:24:21.861 --> 00:24:26.270
They're saying,
man,
yes,
but I don't know,
man.
That's tough.

405
00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:30.320
It's a such a historic event.

406
00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:32.150
I mean if she would have went right through Holly,

407
00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:35.750
that fight would have been fucking forgotten.
That would have been one of those.

408
00:24:35.751 --> 00:24:39.590
Did you know random fights?
If she would've just went right through her instead,

409
00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:43.580
that's a moment in time that will go on forever.

410
00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:47.270
It's also a buster Douglas,
it's also a martial arts lesson.

411
00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:51.110
It's a lesson in martial arts.
It's the lesson and approach.
Like if you get your,

412
00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:56.260
you take away the personalities and the stardom and the friendship,

413
00:24:56.750 --> 00:25:01.550
all the stuff that you have for those people and you just look at it as like two

414
00:25:01.551 --> 00:25:05.390
components,
like two,
two numbers interacting with each other.

415
00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:08.990
Just to look at it like completely objective.

416
00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:14.140
What you see is like one strategy that's really effective with one type of

417
00:25:14.421 --> 00:25:18.470
movement,
like when really refined movements,
worldclass movement,

418
00:25:18.471 --> 00:25:23.060
foot work and then angles and understanding the technique like super well and

419
00:25:23.061 --> 00:25:23.894
another.

420
00:25:24.170 --> 00:25:29.170
You see the super determined athlete who's been very dominant but just the

421
00:25:29.661 --> 00:25:33.470
numbers aren't adding up and as the round goes up she's further and further in a

422
00:25:33.471 --> 00:25:37.010
deficit because she keeps getting cracked and then Holly keeps cut.

423
00:25:37.011 --> 00:25:41.090
And then your confidence wanes.
It has to.
There's no doubt,
right?

424
00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:44.600
There's the frustration.
There's the numbers of time that she's getting hit.

425
00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:49.100
There's a lot of things like factoring in and it all leads up to that insane

426
00:25:49.101 --> 00:25:53.390
head kick we see in exhausted,
but still aggressive Rhonda,

427
00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:58.750
and when Holly pushes her and then boom sets up that left high kick,

428
00:25:58.761 --> 00:26:01.490
you're like,
that's a martial arts lesson that this can have straight up.

429
00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:03.830
This can happen to anybody.
Anybody,
man.
That's why.

430
00:26:03.831 --> 00:26:08.180
That's why fighting so different than other sports can happen to anyone.
For me,

431
00:26:08.181 --> 00:26:11.390
I hated to see it,
man.
I liked seeing greatness.
You know what I'm saying?

432
00:26:11.391 --> 00:26:15.770
I love seeing greatness.
While we saw it,
we saw it in Holly.
That was greatness.

433
00:26:15.771 --> 00:26:20.140
This is an opportunity for Rhonda to Shell Harbor Percent Greatness and the,

434
00:26:20.570 --> 00:26:24.020
again,
it's all about matchups.
Holly has some tough fights besides Ronda.

435
00:26:24.021 --> 00:26:25.880
Miesha Tate's a hell of a fight for Holly.

436
00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:29.070
There's those cats and Ghana cats in Ghana.
These aren't,

437
00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:33.830
these aren't just going to dominate man.
No.
So I think it's good for the sport,

438
00:26:33.860 --> 00:26:38.510
but also Holly's also a person that you could tell if you have young daughters,

439
00:26:38.511 --> 00:26:43.320
you want him to be like Holly,
great person,
amazing person,
just a nice person.

440
00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:47.250
We can't get her.
The media cannot get her to talk shit about Rhonda.

441
00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:48.660
She's just a great person.

442
00:26:48.661 --> 00:26:52.860
Even when Ron goes a long way in their face at the weigh ins,
I asked her,

443
00:26:52.861 --> 00:26:56.340
she's like,
wow,
I was just trying to have a drink here and there.

444
00:26:56.410 --> 00:26:58.170
Like after Ronda went crazy on her,

445
00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:01.800
she like didn't even respond back like fuck you bitch,
you're the fucking fake.

446
00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:04.900
You fucking take damage.
She didn't,
none of that.
She,

447
00:27:04.910 --> 00:27:08.940
she's been in world home fights,
you know,
multiple times.
So to her it was like,

448
00:27:08.941 --> 00:27:09.990
all right,
let's do it man.

449
00:27:10.050 --> 00:27:13.800
You know there's also like she had two other fights in the UFC,
the first one,

450
00:27:13.801 --> 00:27:15.990
which is like the octagon shock fight.

451
00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:19.410
I'm always willing to kind of throw out the first fight.
UFC jitters.
Yeah.

452
00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:22.140
Just like so many people.
That's just such a big moment.
And they go,
man,

453
00:27:22.141 --> 00:27:24.780
next time I get it now I'll just go in there and fight my fight.

454
00:27:25.010 --> 00:27:27.440
And then the second fight was marrying her.
No,
she looked way better,

455
00:27:27.510 --> 00:27:29.940
look much better.
But this fight is like,

456
00:27:30.090 --> 00:27:35.090
she must have put in just mad hours and been more focused and more determined

457
00:27:35.701 --> 00:27:39.900
for this and just had an incredible camp and had a game plan is stuck to the

458
00:27:39.930 --> 00:27:43.760
plan man.
Like that first round dude,
she never stopped moving,

459
00:27:43.890 --> 00:27:45.530
never stopped executing the game plan.

460
00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:48.930
Even took Rhonda Down when she does Rhonda down.
I was like,
what the hell?

461
00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:52.920
How many of uh,
the,
the other two fights I didn't get to see,
but uh,

462
00:27:53.820 --> 00:27:58.140
did her opponents stop coming forward or at least stand still or move backwards?

463
00:27:58.141 --> 00:28:01.760
So they're not really decision close.
Rodney kept coming to all the time.

464
00:28:01.790 --> 00:28:04.700
Well we know where it came forward like Rhonda did.
No one does.

465
00:28:04.710 --> 00:28:07.080
No one does because Ronda comes forward like a demon.

466
00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:12.440
She comes forward like Vandelay Silva and [inaudible] comes forward so hard that

467
00:28:12.810 --> 00:28:15.530
uh,
that moment happened where it looked like a matter of one.

468
00:28:15.570 --> 00:28:17.940
You know what I mean?
That's how hard she was calming.

469
00:28:18.030 --> 00:28:19.840
That's what made her look ridiculous.

470
00:28:19.841 --> 00:28:22.860
That's what made it look ridiculous cause she's trying so hard in college.

471
00:28:22.861 --> 00:28:24.120
Like what,
what are we doing?

472
00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:28.830
Holly's just on a completely different level when it came to our standup and for

473
00:28:28.831 --> 00:28:33.150
her to come in and that great shape and that focus like she was for that fight.

474
00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:35.190
You got to see everything she's capable of,

475
00:28:35.430 --> 00:28:38.020
which I don't think we've ever seen inside the octagon Winkle.

476
00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:39.690
John was saying that,
uh,

477
00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:43.710
they laid back and that like she didn't show everything in our first two fights

478
00:28:43.711 --> 00:28:48.450
on purpose.
Yeah,
that's true.
That's crazy.

479
00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:53.160
Like if she really like took it easy on purpose to set up the fight with Ronda

480
00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:56.090
and then uncork all of our talent and that one fight it,

481
00:28:56.460 --> 00:28:59.810
I was ever done that I remember being at that being true.
It could,

482
00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:01.080
it could be totally,
dude.

483
00:29:01.081 --> 00:29:03.830
I wouldn't be true cause Holly striking so much better and everyone's,

484
00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:04.673
it could be true.

485
00:29:04.710 --> 00:29:09.570
I remember being at Jackson's and the room stopping to watch Holly Spar Dude's

486
00:29:09.740 --> 00:29:14.140
uh,
other girls and just murking bitches up.
Wow.
Yeah.

487
00:29:14.430 --> 00:29:17.750
Just merkin girls up man.
And like I said,
look,
couldn't,

488
00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:20.400
could not happen to a nicer person.
Isn't it an interesting no,

489
00:29:20.401 --> 00:29:23.950
but you knew all that and yet you still thought that Rhonda was going to be tail

490
00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:27.140
man,
I'm,
I'm part,
I'm the guy who got honey,
Dick and I,

491
00:29:27.150 --> 00:29:31.410
and I'm balls deep in this UFC game outside of my black belt in the UFC game and

492
00:29:31.411 --> 00:29:34.770
I,
I was like,
oh no.
I even,
I think it's that on this.
So I said,
I'm much though.

493
00:29:34.950 --> 00:29:38.760
Yeah,
I think Rhonda is going to win,
but if you look back at Holly's fights,

494
00:29:38.761 --> 00:29:42.190
like I've been going back like Holly's fights.
Yeah,
man.

495
00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:46.150
<v 2>No Shit.
No Shit.
It was just a perfect storm.
Both those tools,</v>

496
00:29:46.151 --> 00:29:48.640
UFC fights threw everybody off.
Especially the first one.

497
00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:53.110
We're cal painting by the way,
is tough as fuck.
Super time.
She's also,

498
00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:56.290
she's sneaky.
She's not going to just charge straight out.
You like that.

499
00:29:56.291 --> 00:30:00.460
She makes it a little bit more difficult then you factor in the nerves and
again,

500
00:30:00.461 --> 00:30:03.360
the Mirin Reno fight,
she looked way better.
She definitely looked,
hey,

501
00:30:03.370 --> 00:30:06.200
she got fight of the night for that I think or think.

502
00:30:06.270 --> 00:30:08.530
I think it was one of the performances of the night.

503
00:30:08.531 --> 00:30:11.350
I don't know if it was fight of the night or what,
but she um,

504
00:30:12.070 --> 00:30:16.810
in the Rhonda fight though,
she was,
it was 100% 110%.

505
00:30:16.811 --> 00:30:19.180
I don't think we do.
I don't think we've ever seen a fighter,

506
00:30:19.270 --> 00:30:21.010
male or female in their prime,

507
00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:25.970
this big of a superstar get out class like that.
No,
no we haven't.

508
00:30:26.690 --> 00:30:29.110
We've seen people get caught.
We like got fucked.
They'll be back.

509
00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:30.640
We've never seen where like,
oh shit.

510
00:30:30.670 --> 00:30:33.700
She got dismantled from the bell from the beginning.

511
00:30:34.870 --> 00:30:38.130
She just got to focus on taking her down.
That's it.
No sense in her.

512
00:30:38.131 --> 00:30:42.490
She also has to focus on just fighting.
I mean she made a movie,
she's,

513
00:30:42.550 --> 00:30:45.550
she's going to make roadhouse like a female roadhouse.

514
00:30:45.850 --> 00:30:50.230
She's got all sorts of other shit going on.
Sony,
Sony,

515
00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:55.480
Sony,
Sony's to tell him,
can you imagine if name anyone else?
Granted,

516
00:30:55.481 --> 00:30:58.510
I realize Rhonda is leaps and bounds ahead of a lot of the girls,

517
00:30:58.570 --> 00:31:00.850
but she's finally met a girl who she's not.

518
00:31:00.970 --> 00:31:03.530
So Holly's not on this track to make Origami.

519
00:31:03.550 --> 00:31:07.060
All he wants to be is a world champ of the UFC.
Came at Jeff,
uh,

520
00:31:07.110 --> 00:31:09.550
Verdomme or Cain Velasquez or Chris Weidman.

521
00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:14.290
We're making movies than trying to defend their belt and then would get fucked

522
00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:19.210
up.
You know,
it's crazy.
Can you imagine Patrick Code tables doing movies?

523
00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:23.140
You'd be like,
I'm gonna fuck this dude up.
I used to love seeing that.

524
00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:25.330
When I see my guy doing something on the side,
I'm like,
dude,

525
00:31:25.331 --> 00:31:28.570
he's about to get fucked up.
Cause while he's balls deep in this script,

526
00:31:28.750 --> 00:31:32.860
I'm training my ass off.
Meanwhile,
sexy Yama looks fucking great.

527
00:31:33.410 --> 00:31:36.250
This guy knew,
I didn't know he was fighting on this card.

528
00:31:36.430 --> 00:31:38.560
I mean you're talking about duties or pride veteran,

529
00:31:38.710 --> 00:31:42.670
his fucking standup books sharpish shit tonight.
His body's on point.

530
00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:46.240
It's Annette Tans always on point.
You know,
he sells out arenas.

531
00:31:46.241 --> 00:31:49.720
Seems does look at me.
Do you know that is the voice of an angel?
No,

532
00:31:49.721 --> 00:31:53.730
he's not an angel body of a God voice of an angel body of a God.

533
00:31:53.740 --> 00:31:57.290
That's pretty crazy.
He's a huge singing star and Japan.

534
00:31:58.550 --> 00:32:02.490
That's crazy.
It is.
Korea.
Is he still a huge star over there?

535
00:32:02.530 --> 00:32:07.300
Picked your street ass on your case then he's like,
no,

536
00:32:07.301 --> 00:32:09.040
he's not a one hit wonder.
Well,

537
00:32:09.041 --> 00:32:12.820
jet Japan's beach like that with a like just abandoned stuff.

538
00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.580
Like they were really into MMA for a while.
Like it was huge.

539
00:32:15.581 --> 00:32:18.940
Like they used to sell at the site,
Thomas Subaru arena and then they're like,
ah,

540
00:32:18.970 --> 00:32:22.090
not anymore.
We're good.
Good.
It's not like,

541
00:32:22.091 --> 00:32:25.160
you know like football in the u s will never die.
Never.

542
00:32:25.230 --> 00:32:26.230
Something would have to be,

543
00:32:26.231 --> 00:32:30.340
even with all the concussion info and this deal's good myth movie,

544
00:32:30.460 --> 00:32:33.130
people like Blah Blah,
blah,
whatever,
whatever.
100%.

545
00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:39.040
Nobody gives a fuck.
They give up,
they give up.
They don't give a fuck.

546
00:32:39.290 --> 00:32:42.490
What weren't they super into like a cut like country western.

547
00:32:42.491 --> 00:32:46.280
It's like been catching last one hillbilly type shit dressed up like Elvis.

548
00:32:46.930 --> 00:32:48.500
They abandoned.
So don't,

549
00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:52.670
can't you buy like a old underwear in the vending machines?

550
00:32:52.671 --> 00:32:54.170
You can see I've never been over there.

551
00:32:54.171 --> 00:32:58.520
To me it's a fucking different world in the early two thousands Japanese are

552
00:32:58.521 --> 00:33:02.930
really,
and to have an Afro's ones.
It was really cool.

553
00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:04.220
Now,
the models,

554
00:33:08.460 --> 00:33:12.110
when you take an or white dude or an Asian dude and give him an Afro,

555
00:33:12.111 --> 00:33:16.230
what is involved in that process?
It was a five minute Ben.

556
00:33:16.430 --> 00:33:20.920
Do you remember,
were you just like,
God sent some work?

557
00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:26.510
Who at an Afro?
He fought Rico Rodriguez in pride.
He ended up dying,

558
00:33:26.540 --> 00:33:27.920
but I forget his name.

559
00:33:28.070 --> 00:33:32.230
He was a book house to Cerro Japanese with us,

560
00:33:33.550 --> 00:33:36.200
Bro.
He fought in pride.
He fought Rico Rodriguez.
I remember that.

561
00:33:37.030 --> 00:33:41.750
It's called a perm.
Forget his name.
Correct.
How did he die?

562
00:33:42.950 --> 00:33:45.470
I don't remember.
But uh,
he's done

563
00:33:48.380 --> 00:33:52.940
recipes.
Good fucking sexy Yama looks man.

564
00:33:53.090 --> 00:33:56.570
Is this a middleweight fight or is this a welterweight fight?
Has to be,
well,

565
00:33:56.610 --> 00:34:00.100
is he
tan like from a booth?
That's,

566
00:34:00.110 --> 00:34:04.460
that's a good gold tan son.
He could easily be from Laos.
Yeah,
right.

567
00:34:04.730 --> 00:34:07.760
He's one of them.
Chocolate,
Asians,
one of those dudes,
Bruce Lee [inaudible],

568
00:34:08.210 --> 00:34:10.640
who's got a better body than Akiyama.

569
00:34:10.690 --> 00:34:12.890
It's kind of like the best body of all time.
There's only,

570
00:34:12.950 --> 00:34:16.560
there's one guy who I might give it to over him and that's Woodley Woodley.

571
00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:21.580
His body up on chocolate is the best ass Woodley.

572
00:34:22.190 --> 00:34:24.200
That's a bubble.
But I know I sound weird here,

573
00:34:24.201 --> 00:34:26.040
but Willie's packings a beat back their

574
00:34:29.950 --> 00:34:34.700
silence,
but to what car?

575
00:34:34.830 --> 00:34:36.900
One had a fucking honeydew melon back

576
00:34:41.710 --> 00:34:45.770
to bowing out of fucking ghetto booty.
Let them gorilla little booties,

577
00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:49.720
the zoo.
And you see the silver bag waddling around.

578
00:34:50.010 --> 00:34:53.530
You put cheeks to fucking water knowns.

579
00:34:53.540 --> 00:34:55.460
You put a thumb on Darwin,
man.

580
00:34:56.900 --> 00:34:59.780
He bent over like God damn son.
That's a hairy ass.

581
00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:06.710
Your ass Nicki Minaj it homeboy sexy.
I'm gonna get kicked in the jewels.

582
00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:11.590
Oh No.
Oh.
Oh.

583
00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:14.700
He looked like he kicked him in the nuts.
Nobody kicked anybody.

584
00:35:14.740 --> 00:35:18.040
I'm going me see this shit kick.
Oh,

585
00:35:18.090 --> 00:35:22.460
he grazed the helmet.
Oh,
bars.
Shit.

586
00:35:23.210 --> 00:35:26.980
Ooh,
I bet you he is packing heat.
Giant Dick.

587
00:35:27.020 --> 00:35:31.310
Just a big old angry fucking Korean Dick.
Hey,

588
00:35:31.311 --> 00:35:34.520
you think seeing nothing

589
00:35:36.950 --> 00:35:39.390
last Samurai,
Gog Magic's

590
00:35:39.710 --> 00:35:40.950
<v 0>sayings when he pulls his dick out.</v>

591
00:35:43.960 --> 00:35:45.200
Imagine all the pussies.

592
00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:51.330
I believe he's married with a family.
Eddie Bravo.
How about you?
Just back off.

593
00:35:51.830 --> 00:35:55.500
Who the built or just doing work?

594
00:35:55.501 --> 00:35:59.580
He's like fucking Godzilla.
Probably Ganga is Khan in the whole country.

595
00:36:00.210 --> 00:36:01.070
Didn't get 'em down.

596
00:36:02.270 --> 00:36:05.760
Fucking building this guy like he must be just like lifting weights all the
time.

597
00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:07.050
All the time.
There's no other way.

598
00:36:07.051 --> 00:36:10.320
Like it's not normal for a fight or beautiful like that.
I agree.

599
00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:13.800
I mean when you're doing wrestling,
Jiu Jitsu,
kickboxing,

600
00:36:13.950 --> 00:36:17.060
it's hard to keep up a physique.
Like that hundred percent liquid.

601
00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:21.730
His haircut too.
That's gotta be natural.
No Way.
He's on pills,
right?

602
00:36:22.110 --> 00:36:23.920
Well I dunno man.
Oh comment.

603
00:36:23.930 --> 00:36:28.930
But the bottom line about juice is those guys that fought in pride like they

604
00:36:29.341 --> 00:36:33.450
definitely could have then.
So what weight class would they have?

605
00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:34.853
Those good question.

606
00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:37.950
I think he was wanting 85 I think he was in vandelays weight class.
Right?

607
00:36:38.010 --> 00:36:41.220
Oh Shit,
dude.
For people are like,
oh,
steroids aren't that big of a deal.

608
00:36:41.221 --> 00:36:45.480
Thank [inaudible] big foot too.
There's so such a big deal.
Oh my gosh.

609
00:36:45.481 --> 00:36:49.560
Such a big deal.
It's such a big deal.
So when women take them,
you know,

610
00:36:49.590 --> 00:36:53.370
I mean that's,
that's even sometimes more of a big deal.
I agree.

611
00:36:54.540 --> 00:36:55.373
That's a,
you know,

612
00:36:55.650 --> 00:36:59.870
I bet it was reading this thing about what happens to women bodybuilding.

613
00:37:00.580 --> 00:37:04.650
Oh,
he's getting,
oh yeah.
He got them in the back of the headers year.

614
00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:07.330
He got a tag,
but he keeps moving.
Maybe a mean.
Yeah.

615
00:37:07.331 --> 00:37:10.950
Good luck getting out of alive when you beat up the fucking national icon.

616
00:37:11.490 --> 00:37:12.640
Fuck up his same voice.

617
00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:20.430
Hey Ratko.
He's done.
He's done.
He has a singing career.
You asshole.
Oh my God.

618
00:37:20.980 --> 00:37:24.510
Yes.
Oh God.
I made it out of the round praise.

619
00:37:24.511 --> 00:37:28.610
Akiyama third round.
No,
I don't think so.
Yeah.
We don't know.
Damn.

620
00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:32.910
This dude is on really paying attention.
He is fucked up.
Damn.

621
00:37:33.150 --> 00:37:34.350
His body's distracting.

622
00:37:34.370 --> 00:37:38.070
So I was reading this thing about female bodybuilders in the permanent effects

623
00:37:38.071 --> 00:37:43.071
it has on them when they like you imagine that girls take male hormones just to

624
00:37:43.711 --> 00:37:47.370
get jack like a dude in their underwear and pose on stage.

625
00:37:47.610 --> 00:37:52.230
Like you literally change your physiology.
Essentially.
You Go,

626
00:37:52.350 --> 00:37:56.180
you shift way over to the male side.
There's no coming back,
right?
Yeah.

627
00:37:56.220 --> 00:37:59.670
Like you're not just on no.
Come on.
Gang cycle of steroids.

628
00:38:00.390 --> 00:38:04.470
Dude's Jalan,
you know tidies everything changes,
changes.

629
00:38:04.471 --> 00:38:07.290
Their frame changes,
their bone structure take.

630
00:38:07.291 --> 00:38:10.230
But I think if you take a hormones,

631
00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:13.800
it takes seven years to get back to where you will.
So you would have to take,

632
00:38:13.801 --> 00:38:15.750
like you could change your body in seven years.

633
00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:17.960
You'd have to take like female hormones.
That makes sense.

634
00:38:17.970 --> 00:38:19.440
That's how transsexuals do it.

635
00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:23.760
A transsexual man takes male or it takes female hormones then becomes more

636
00:38:23.761 --> 00:38:27.620
feminine over time.
But seven years now to see the thing of,
they're saying that,

637
00:38:27.650 --> 00:38:32.200
but I don't know if it's different.
21 years you could go back in there.
Yeah,

638
00:38:32.250 --> 00:38:34.200
but I don't know if it's different.
What if there's on that?

639
00:38:34.530 --> 00:38:35.650
I don't know if it's different.

640
00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:38.770
<v 2>I don't know if it's different with a women,</v>

641
00:38:39.330 --> 00:38:41.290
like if it goes women to men or men and women.

642
00:38:41.291 --> 00:38:42.550
It's the same if it's the same pace,

643
00:38:42.551 --> 00:38:47.170
but they're saying that when a man goes to a woman doctor,
Ramona Kraits,

644
00:38:47.171 --> 00:38:50.770
I think her name is [inaudible],
she,
they interviewed her for us.

645
00:38:51.290 --> 00:38:54.220
Stephie Crooklyn interviewed her about Fallon Fox.

646
00:38:54.221 --> 00:38:56.740
And one of the things they were saying is when you take estrogen,

647
00:38:56.890 --> 00:39:00.760
it actually preserves bone density.
So like,
yeah.
Yeah,

648
00:39:00.790 --> 00:39:05.080
because like that's why women,
when they get older,
they develop osteoporosis.

649
00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:08.080
So this idea that like taking the estrogen is automatically,

650
00:39:08.081 --> 00:39:11.150
and they give you like lower bone density,
like,
uh,
like uh,
uh,

651
00:39:11.770 --> 00:39:14.380
a woman of Shit back Yemen.
They're still thrown down.

652
00:39:14.470 --> 00:39:18.430
That's not necessarily the case.
So if you had a woman that took testosterone,

653
00:39:18.431 --> 00:39:21.910
got like more manly,
right?
And then start taking estrogen,

654
00:39:22.070 --> 00:39:26.950
like it just doesn't necessarily mean it would shrink her gold structure back

655
00:39:26.951 --> 00:39:28.410
down.
Cause it's very tricky.

656
00:39:28.990 --> 00:39:31.990
It's very tricky because there's a cycle to that shit.
You know,
there's,

657
00:39:31.991 --> 00:39:35.190
there's a lot going on in your body.
Like they're all interconnected.

658
00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:38.680
That's why when dudes take steroids,
they get bitch tits.
Like your body's like,

659
00:39:38.681 --> 00:39:41.290
hey fuck face.
Like what's,
what's,
what all his testosterone.

660
00:39:41.530 --> 00:39:45.650
I'm going to give you tidies cause yeah,
cause all your testosterone,

661
00:39:45.670 --> 00:39:48.520
then your body goes up.
We need estrogen imbalances.
Your body is like,

662
00:39:48.521 --> 00:39:53.460
you've got way too much test you fucking crazy deck.
Enjoy these tits.
Yeah.
Joy.

663
00:39:53.500 --> 00:39:56.410
I'm joining his tits to.
These guys are going off.

664
00:39:56.450 --> 00:40:00.070
Meanwhile sexy Yama has survived.
Fuck yeah.

665
00:40:00.870 --> 00:40:03.550
Good man.
Yeah man.
Hell yeah.
He's looking good in this,

666
00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:06.490
this round in consideration.

667
00:40:06.491 --> 00:40:09.430
The fact that he almost got stopped just two minutes ago.
Dude,

668
00:40:09.431 --> 00:40:13.930
he has a salty STFC record.
Dude.
He's been around for a long time.

669
00:40:14.110 --> 00:40:16.900
That your ass,
but remember one Vito lit him up.

670
00:40:16.990 --> 00:40:20.320
Oof like a Christmas tree in Times Square.
Fuck.

671
00:40:22.270 --> 00:40:25.870
Hey Victoria Anderson Silva.
Hom Brazil.
Goodness.
Oh my goodness.

672
00:40:25.871 --> 00:40:29.900
What a fight for sure.
Just let them both juice to the gills.
He can't walk.

673
00:40:32.430 --> 00:40:35.680
Yeah,
you're right.
Probably I want like Margaret Beier,
Sammy Sosa,
Shit.

674
00:40:35.710 --> 00:40:40.180
That left leg is Jack my five Akiyama with the fucking white tie.

675
00:40:40.990 --> 00:40:45.000
Bang Bang.
Damn.
What a crazy fun cards mean.

676
00:40:45.010 --> 00:40:46.030
Fucking good.

677
00:40:47.500 --> 00:40:52.000
So did you see that thing that I'm Victor Conte tweeted,
dude,

678
00:40:52.420 --> 00:40:57.220
I,
I walked.
I could literally,
it was like,
is this real life that I sent you?

679
00:40:57.510 --> 00:41:00.730
Then I sent it to you.
I said,
is this real life the thing about Holly Holm?

680
00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:05.890
Oh yes.
Most with Eddie.
You know what we're talking about?

681
00:41:06.030 --> 00:41:07.270
Nah,
this is ridiculous.

682
00:41:07.271 --> 00:41:11.710
Victor Conde tweeted this thing where some bodybuilding expert zoomed in on

683
00:41:11.711 --> 00:41:16.711
Holly Holmes crotch zoomed in on her bikini's and was like the zoomed in on her

684
00:41:17.410 --> 00:41:22.120
where her vagina is and they're trying to say that she has clitoral hypertrophy

685
00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:25.120
based on her Moose snuggle.
Yes,
exactly.

686
00:41:25.420 --> 00:41:30.420
[inaudible] Moose knuckle.

687
00:41:30.581 --> 00:41:34.290
That's amazing.
It's so stupid.
Oh Shit.
Fuck.
Akiyama I'm gonna get the leg core

688
00:41:34.310 --> 00:41:37.550
<v 0>Victor Conte to tweak that out.
It takes the credibility away from him.</v>

689
00:41:37.610 --> 00:41:39.770
I couldn't believe.
I'm like,
first of all,

690
00:41:39.771 --> 00:41:43.100
you don't know what it looked like before.
Like you're basing this on what you,

691
00:41:43.101 --> 00:41:46.430
just the way it looks like women's Vagina Lips are quite different.

692
00:41:46.450 --> 00:41:50.080
The people are just haters.
Man was world champion.
Now,
where were you before you,

693
00:41:50.350 --> 00:41:53.620
this is like a Wayne photo.
Yes.
The way in photo of her,

694
00:41:53.621 --> 00:41:58.080
so they just zoom in like weigh in on the box.
She wasn't born with those things.

695
00:41:59.310 --> 00:42:02.210
They're just trying to hate on her.
Mary,
she's the champ.

696
00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:05.510
Some chicks don't talk to too.
She's the preacher's daughter,

697
00:42:05.540 --> 00:42:08.000
but his son of a bitch.
It's like,
I was watching this.
I was like,

698
00:42:08.001 --> 00:42:12.170
is this real life to Victor Conte?
Really tweet this v you just sent me the link.

699
00:42:12.171 --> 00:42:15.470
I just thought it was some bull shit.
Then he sent it in an email too.

700
00:42:15.740 --> 00:42:17.190
I think I got it.
Anyway,

701
00:42:18.090 --> 00:42:21.440
I got it in an email blast from him and I got it in a tweet.
I was like,
Whoa,

702
00:42:21.441 --> 00:42:26.120
really dude,
I won't even entertain that bullshit.
It's so silly.

703
00:42:26.820 --> 00:42:30.080
So silly to even say something like that.
You know?

704
00:42:30.081 --> 00:42:34.790
If it's one thing to have someone who believed that,

705
00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:37.610
but it's another thing for a guy like Victor Conte to tweet it.

706
00:42:37.650 --> 00:42:42.100
We have some credibility,
right?
He's known as a snitch on everyone.
Well doing.

707
00:42:42.350 --> 00:42:46.550
He was one of the guys at Balka,
but he wasn't like a scientist.
Right.

708
00:42:46.551 --> 00:42:49.700
He was just like a sort of a marketing guy.
Yeah.
All our king guy behind it.
Yeah.

709
00:42:50.840 --> 00:42:54.620
This is so crazy.
This guy missed the shot and oh shit.
Oh

710
00:42:56.270 --> 00:42:59.450
Shit.
He didn't give me a chance to get up.

711
00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:04.560
There's a guy in the NFL,
his name's Landry,
if you've ever seen this one yet.

712
00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:08.060
You know what I'm talking about,
Jamie?
His arms are,
he's fucking Jack,

713
00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:12.740
so he's been caught three times for steroids and this last time they're like,

714
00:43:12.920 --> 00:43:16.640
Bro,
just so he served a 10 game suspension.

715
00:43:16.820 --> 00:43:19.550
He gets off the suspension.
He knows he's going to be tested again.

716
00:43:20.570 --> 00:43:25.550
Hot Positive for steroids.
Just can't not take him.
He's fucking jacked man.

717
00:43:25.551 --> 00:43:25.851
I see.

718
00:43:25.851 --> 00:43:30.020
I was always under the impression that everyone in the NFL was on steroids.

719
00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:32.650
There's so big.
I was like,
when you see it,

720
00:43:32.651 --> 00:43:37.070
350 pound person like that he's had,
he looked at that picture,

721
00:43:37.080 --> 00:43:41.360
look at the screen off Jesus came and he supposed to be fast and quick.
God,

722
00:43:41.361 --> 00:43:45.260
look at his arms.
He's a fucking monster.
Those arms are retarded.

723
00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:50.210
He's probably like one of the biggest guys arms I've ever seen.
Old Ones.

724
00:43:50.211 --> 00:43:53.530
Now he's on,
he's on team fucking sit at home.
He's on the,

725
00:43:53.750 --> 00:43:55.100
he's on the same team as I am.

726
00:43:57.600 --> 00:43:59.870
So dude like that,
right?

727
00:44:00.290 --> 00:44:03.860
Like he's obviously taking him for football,
right?

728
00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:08.120
Once you get gigantic for who can you get that big without doing juice?

729
00:44:08.180 --> 00:44:10.760
I don't think so.
And that Lien,
I don't think so.
Right?

730
00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:15.980
So when you see all those gigantic fucking dudes that are playing for the NFL,

731
00:44:16.850 --> 00:44:19.730
some of them are gotta be genetics,
right?
100%.
There's,

732
00:44:19.731 --> 00:44:23.540
I've seen some guys who are just complete freaks where people chalk it up to

733
00:44:23.541 --> 00:44:26.240
steroids,
but it's not,
they're just genetically different than we are.

734
00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:30.470
But are they like ridiculously ripped and big or they liked the lineman that are

735
00:44:30.660 --> 00:44:34.110
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
Like my best friend Joe cloth had Stein.
He's six,

736
00:44:34.111 --> 00:44:37.770
six to 76% body fat just woke up like that.

737
00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:40.380
Jesus Christ just woke the fuck up like that.

738
00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:43.590
I was with them last night and he just balls deep in donuts.
I'm like,

739
00:44:43.591 --> 00:44:47.940
what the fuck are you doing?
And then I tried it fucking,
yeah,

740
00:44:47.941 --> 00:44:52.080
I can't do that.
Wow.
Look at that.

741
00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:57.390
Wow.
They're going to make a gift of her to get crazy.
Yeah.

742
00:44:57.420 --> 00:45:01.920
That will be on that harrowing
Yama.

743
00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:06.210
Sexy Yama.
We get Bruce buffer call on the first round.
It's a good question.

744
00:45:06.211 --> 00:45:07.044
We were talking.

745
00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:07.900
<v 3>Okay.</v>

746
00:45:07.900 --> 00:45:10.270
<v 0>For sure.
Akiyama one,
there's no way he's going to lose this.</v>

747
00:45:10.300 --> 00:45:14.600
That just doesn't happen.
And uh oh the action they bring in judges?
No,

748
00:45:15.180 --> 00:45:18.660
really an Asian.
He,
it's part of the deal up.

749
00:45:19.070 --> 00:45:23.290
Ah Fuck we are shelves or draw that guys.
That was a Chinese judge.

750
00:45:27.180 --> 00:45:31.470
Oh dare you.
How dare you.

751
00:45:31.471 --> 00:45:34.770
Oh Shit.
Yeah.

752
00:45:34.771 --> 00:45:37.220
I mean the third round he looked like dog shit rounds.

753
00:45:37.230 --> 00:45:41.730
Two and three were both ten eight rounds in my opinion.
Do you think?
Both?
Well,

754
00:45:41.940 --> 00:45:43.650
both good.
Are you kidding that,

755
00:45:43.950 --> 00:45:47.670
that he barely made it out of that second round was getting his ass fucked up.

756
00:45:47.671 --> 00:45:50.580
Fucked up.
But two out of 10.
Oh,
I see what you're saying.

757
00:45:50.581 --> 00:45:55.140
So three is a a ten eight for Akiyama though.
Cause he was just fun out of it.

758
00:45:55.440 --> 00:45:58.380
Yeah.
So they both 10 80 to each other.

759
00:45:58.570 --> 00:46:00.780
They didn't need to give those ten eight rounds more.

760
00:46:00.810 --> 00:46:03.600
They need to give those out sometimes and that's a bully beat downs.

761
00:46:03.601 --> 00:46:06.130
Sean's getting dropped.
It has to be ten eight [inaudible].

762
00:46:06.150 --> 00:46:10.620
You can't just like when when guys are getting hurt and they're stunned like

763
00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:14.630
Calvin gas,
Neil Magni you,
you had that point.
I agree with you

764
00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:18.410
around.
You got to give him ten eight that's not a tent.

765
00:46:18.420 --> 00:46:19.830
That's not a regular ten nine round.

766
00:46:19.831 --> 00:46:24.060
That's a different kind of round dude got clipped twice.
Drop twice.

767
00:46:24.061 --> 00:46:28.860
Somebody tried to tell me the first ten nine row I had someone try to tell me

768
00:46:28.861 --> 00:46:31.980
that the first round with gray Maynard versus Frankie Edgar,

769
00:46:31.981 --> 00:46:36.270
was it ten nine round?
I would slap the fuck out of them.
I go three times.

770
00:46:36.271 --> 00:46:39.360
This was a fucking professional judge.
We're having an argument about it.

771
00:46:39.390 --> 00:46:42.000
Oh my God,
what are you talking about?
I go,
well,

772
00:46:42.001 --> 00:46:44.130
that is the epitome of a ten eight round.

773
00:46:44.300 --> 00:46:47.970
At least ten eight they should never be able to judge him again.
And he goes,

774
00:46:47.971 --> 00:46:51.780
well,
no,
because the fight wasn't close to being stopped and shut the fuck up.

775
00:46:51.990 --> 00:46:54.930
That was as close as a fight gets to be in stopped saying.

776
00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:59.010
The guy was actually literally saying that to me and he said,
oh my God.

777
00:46:59.010 --> 00:47:01.650
It was the most frustrating conversation I've ever had with somebody.

778
00:47:01.970 --> 00:47:04.770
Well that hats cause I knew that this guy is professional.
What does that,

779
00:47:04.771 --> 00:47:07.950
that's a Brazilian makes me sad.
Lama Wrangler

780
00:47:11.210 --> 00:47:16.210
Juggle Dodging Capek Baras k Lama wrangling my momma is come on does that,

781
00:47:20.830 --> 00:47:21.810
that's going to be hard man.

782
00:47:21.811 --> 00:47:24.720
When you almost finished the guy in the second round but then you almost get

783
00:47:24.721 --> 00:47:28.140
finished and the third and you walk away with a victory.
That's crazy.

784
00:47:28.200 --> 00:47:31.550
Those kind of decisions are weird because I do go by the,

785
00:47:31.580 --> 00:47:35.620
the idea that like I liked how pride did it where they judge the fight as a

786
00:47:35.621 --> 00:47:38.200
whole.
But though I think and to of the round,

787
00:47:38.340 --> 00:47:41.750
the end of the fights worth more because like if you're watching too,

788
00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:44.080
this is the,
the,
the rationale behind it.

789
00:47:44.081 --> 00:47:47.440
You're watching two kids fight in the school and the school yard and then it's

790
00:47:47.441 --> 00:47:49.990
gone back and forth and back and forth.
But the end of the fight,

791
00:47:50.350 --> 00:47:53.650
one dude gets on top of the other dude and full mountain punches him in the face

792
00:47:53.651 --> 00:47:55.510
a bunch of times and then the teachers pull them off.

793
00:47:55.870 --> 00:47:59.710
So at the end have Jimmy one,
that dude is on top dropping bombs on you.

794
00:47:59.711 --> 00:48:00.730
He definitely won.

795
00:48:00.850 --> 00:48:04.480
I don't care if you hit him 30 times before he took you down and he only landed

796
00:48:04.481 --> 00:48:06.250
three punches while you were down.

797
00:48:06.251 --> 00:48:09.190
If he was on top and he's punching you in the face when the teachers came,

798
00:48:09.310 --> 00:48:11.030
you one legit,
right

799
00:48:14.510 --> 00:48:18.710
elementary back.
I want you did in the first or second round.
Oh,

800
00:48:18.760 --> 00:48:21.760
obviously it didn't mean anything because you're getting your ass beat at the

801
00:48:21.761 --> 00:48:24.760
end is,
what about that knocked down in the first round.
That didn't mean shit.

802
00:48:24.761 --> 00:48:27.370
Look,
look what's going on right now.
You're getting your ass kicked.
Yeah.
It say,

803
00:48:27.371 --> 00:48:30.610
see it's going to be hard to judge like that because then people do like what

804
00:48:30.611 --> 00:48:34.480
they do in Thailand where they wait for the bedding so they lay back in the

805
00:48:34.481 --> 00:48:36.130
first couple of rounds.
You know,

806
00:48:36.131 --> 00:48:38.710
you don't want to see people do that but also like it.

807
00:48:38.711 --> 00:48:43.030
Let's take the Neil magni verse.
Kelvin fight.
When Neal had his back,

808
00:48:43.031 --> 00:48:47.830
it was riding him for a long time.
Had his back for long ass time.
You know.

809
00:48:48.040 --> 00:48:51.700
How's that cause that's a dominant position.
Yeah.
Mount.
It's a dominant position.

810
00:48:51.970 --> 00:48:53.740
He wasn't doing any damage.
That's different.

811
00:48:54.090 --> 00:48:57.040
He was threatening the choke that Renee could show with sue on the first two

812
00:48:57.041 --> 00:49:01.070
rounds.
I'm not,
Dominic don't dominate to dominate,

813
00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:05.740
but why isn't it though?
Kinda isn't it?
What do you mean?
Here's,
here's a,

814
00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:09.700
here's if a guy is on your back for the whole round and he's trying to get that

815
00:49:09.701 --> 00:49:12.310
choke and you're bat and it gets real close a couple of times,

816
00:49:12.520 --> 00:49:14.760
it's in that kind of like a ten eight if it's close,

817
00:49:14.770 --> 00:49:16.770
what I'm saying traveling wise,

818
00:49:16.810 --> 00:49:19.990
that should be a ten eight the crowd's going nuts.
Then he escapes,
right?

819
00:49:20.140 --> 00:49:24.620
That was close.
But if he just has someone's back for the entire round is

820
00:49:26.130 --> 00:49:28.310
so striking,
just commercial sexy,

821
00:49:28.330 --> 00:49:31.710
how much you can strike from the down in the mirror.
Look at this commercial.

822
00:49:31.720 --> 00:49:32.161
What does this,

823
00:49:32.161 --> 00:49:34.960
she's going is dominated what is going on in this commercial snotty.

824
00:49:35.080 --> 00:49:37.600
She can't hit him,
but he's like on a massage chair,

825
00:49:37.601 --> 00:49:41.730
closing his eyes like he's getting blown.
Well that's fucking hook.

826
00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:48.340
It's him versus him.
He's a super star.
What is,
what are we looking at here?

827
00:49:48.630 --> 00:49:50.890
Um,
so confused.
This is fight pass,
right?

828
00:49:50.891 --> 00:49:55.600
So this is all the new inspiration,
dude.
He's a superstar out there.

829
00:49:55.601 --> 00:49:58.300
I'm not mad at that door.
Like explore a haircut.
Oh my God.

830
00:49:58.301 --> 00:50:00.850
It's a fucking an ad for a massage.

831
00:50:01.870 --> 00:50:04.810
It's an ad for a massage chair.
I'll take it.

832
00:50:04.900 --> 00:50:08.590
Have you ever seen that before though?
That confuses the shit out of me.

833
00:50:08.620 --> 00:50:10.600
So what do you think right now with Aldo and McGregor?

834
00:50:11.770 --> 00:50:16.510
That's a tough fucking call,
man.
If,
if you know,
I want Connor to win,

835
00:50:16.511 --> 00:50:19.160
but do you?
I do.
I want Connor to win.

836
00:50:19.210 --> 00:50:22.510
I really liked and I think it's better for the sport form to win.

837
00:50:22.630 --> 00:50:26.770
I think moving forward as a,
as a,
you know,
you're the UFC man,

838
00:50:26.771 --> 00:50:30.520
you want to win.
But Josie Aldo with again,
you know,

839
00:50:30.560 --> 00:50:32.480
I take heat for this with the new testing.

840
00:50:32.481 --> 00:50:35.510
I don't know how it's going to go down.
Oh my God.
How dare you.

841
00:50:36.830 --> 00:50:41.690
You're just saying it.
Why are you saying that?
Cause he's Brazilian [inaudible]

842
00:50:47.350 --> 00:50:48.260
I don't know man.

843
00:50:49.550 --> 00:50:52.850
There's a lot of guys that we've seen fighting with now with the new testing.

844
00:50:52.851 --> 00:50:54.980
It's a different story.
I'm not saying that he is on things.

845
00:50:55.070 --> 00:50:56.690
I'm saying that's the x factor.

846
00:50:56.720 --> 00:51:00.560
I'm not accusing him of shit when you're saying it could be a fact.
Okay,

847
00:51:00.770 --> 00:51:04.520
that's all speculative.
Whatever,
whatever.
Nothing wrong with that.

848
00:51:04.521 --> 00:51:05.240
Nothing wrong with that.

849
00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:08.180
But when you look at it as like as far as like past performances,

850
00:51:08.330 --> 00:51:10.760
we look at it as far as like what their ability,

851
00:51:11.360 --> 00:51:13.910
what they can do inside the octagon.

852
00:51:14.300 --> 00:51:16.310
It should be an insane fight cause you look at,

853
00:51:16.311 --> 00:51:20.790
although it hasn't lost in 10 years,
right,
it's been [inaudible] everybody's ass.

854
00:51:20.920 --> 00:51:24.530
You watched like the,
the like the most spectacular victories that he's had.

855
00:51:24.590 --> 00:51:29.590
Like the Cub Swanson Five Josie LQB pound for pound number one is,

856
00:51:29.630 --> 00:51:33.700
yeah,
he's a fucking,
he's engaged.
He's a beast.
It do ask,

857
00:51:33.710 --> 00:51:37.910
did you Jitsu Nat worldclass Jujitsu and some of the fastest leg kicks in the

858
00:51:37.911 --> 00:51:40.550
fucking sport.
If you,
if you,
if you're going to bet on it.

859
00:51:40.670 --> 00:51:44.990
I mean it's not bad money cause José's and underdog.
That's crazy.

860
00:51:44.991 --> 00:51:46.530
That tries me.
I just,

861
00:51:46.610 --> 00:51:49.310
I just don't understand how someone could call him and I'd have to see it.

862
00:51:49.311 --> 00:51:52.010
You know the odds Jamie?
Yeah.
He's an underdog in Vegas.
You know?

863
00:51:52.030 --> 00:51:55.460
What do you think the logic is that is just height and bedding type?
Well,

864
00:51:55.461 --> 00:52:00.260
think about Rhonda Holly Grant Again.
We're all going to one 12 to one 12 to one.

865
00:52:00.380 --> 00:52:04.100
It's all hype.
And I think a lot of people who make those odds,

866
00:52:04.101 --> 00:52:06.470
they don't know the game inside and out.
But,

867
00:52:06.500 --> 00:52:10.790
but you see Conor on every fuck gone or does smash people,
man.

868
00:52:11.060 --> 00:52:14.060
I mean he really does.
He watched that Dustin [inaudible] fight.

869
00:52:14.270 --> 00:52:18.800
You watch that fight with Dennis Seaver.
Jesus fucking Christ.
He smashes,
peep,

870
00:52:18.801 --> 00:52:19.071
Josie.

871
00:52:19.071 --> 00:52:22.520
All all those oils at a different hour cry from those two different animal.

872
00:52:22.850 --> 00:52:26.360
They bolstered chins.
They both smashed.
So he's plus one 25.

873
00:52:26.390 --> 00:52:30.270
So that's basically even in MMA.
Do you think that the,
uh,

874
00:52:30.340 --> 00:52:33.950
so they're even right now,
damn,
look at,
look at that motherfucking fight card.

875
00:52:34.230 --> 00:52:38.330
Chad is card.
It's the greatest fight card of all time.
Dude.

876
00:52:38.690 --> 00:52:42.770
That's aggressive.
Mr Rogen,
you're not seeing the full car.

877
00:52:42.771 --> 00:52:46.040
You've seen just bedding.
No.
Listen,
here's,

878
00:52:46.200 --> 00:52:48.530
here's Yoel Romero versus jocker array.

879
00:52:48.710 --> 00:52:51.260
So Jeremy Stevens versus Max Holloway.

880
00:52:51.380 --> 00:52:56.180
Liotta him or not Leo them cheat or Luke Rockhold versus Chris Weidman for sure

881
00:52:56.181 --> 00:53:00.830
that Conor McGregor versus Josie,
although that's amazing.
What's the top five?

882
00:53:01.220 --> 00:53:05.930
You Saint Ben in Ufc 100 I don't know.
UFC 100 was Brock versus Frank Mir.

883
00:53:06.110 --> 00:53:10.850
It was George Saint Pierre versus the Elvis.
Michael Bisping.

884
00:53:10.851 --> 00:53:14.180
Dan Henderson,
and understand another barn burner on there too.

885
00:53:14.480 --> 00:53:18.530
I'll say this is the best card,
the best card since then,

886
00:53:19.160 --> 00:53:23.990
how about that?
Akiyama was on that bitch,
was he?
Yes,

887
00:53:24.140 --> 00:53:24.540
and yeah.

888
00:53:24.540 --> 00:53:29.430
John Jones on the undercard Akiyama versus Alan Belcher Belcher should've won.

889
00:53:29.460 --> 00:53:31.690
Did yet.
Martin called Congress bond.

890
00:53:33.770 --> 00:53:38.370
All right.
Here's um,
Ooh.
That's tough.
You don't not,
don't get me wrong.

891
00:53:38.371 --> 00:53:41.910
I'm saying it's a great card.
It's definitely top three of all time.

892
00:53:42.810 --> 00:53:47.340
There's one other big fight.
Oh,
Damien Maia versus fucking Gunnar Nelson.

893
00:53:49.050 --> 00:53:51.300
That's our nuts on the main card.
That's on the main card.
So the,

894
00:53:51.301 --> 00:53:54.960
here's the main card.
The main card is Max Holloway vs Jeremy Stevens.

895
00:53:54.961 --> 00:53:58.770
Damien by a versus Gunnar Nelson.
Jose Aldo versus Conor McGregor.

896
00:53:58.950 --> 00:54:03.290
Chris Weidman versus Luke Rockhold and shock IRA versus Yoel Romero.

897
00:54:03.630 --> 00:54:07.320
I'm not mad at that at all.
It's hard to say.
That's not the best card.
Yeah.

898
00:54:07.321 --> 00:54:10.770
That may know long fucking time like it does the very long,

899
00:54:10.771 --> 00:54:13.470
it might be the best card since 100 but I agree.

900
00:54:13.471 --> 00:54:15.600
It's debatable that we haven't had a card,

901
00:54:15.601 --> 00:54:19.380
that stack that got about Damien Maia and Gunnar Nelson.
I forgot about that.

902
00:54:19.381 --> 00:54:22.200
That's a fucking fight.
That's how good this card is.

903
00:54:22.320 --> 00:54:26.480
You guys watch the ultimate fighter with Connor?
I've,
yeah,
I've seen it.
Yeah,

904
00:54:26.530 --> 00:54:29.040
I forgot that you're riding favors on the undercard.

905
00:54:29.340 --> 00:54:34.340
You know they have stacked it to make sure that if Aldo pulls out,

906
00:54:34.950 --> 00:54:39.930
they've got,
they've got strategies,
they've got Uriah sitting on the undercard.

907
00:54:40.230 --> 00:54:43.620
They've got Frankie Edgar and Chad Mendez fight in the day before.

908
00:54:43.830 --> 00:54:47.560
I mean the whole thing is covered.
Like they've got the three top featherweight.

909
00:54:47.580 --> 00:54:50.880
Even though they're doing that,
I should do that.
It shows a hour to pull out.

910
00:54:51.030 --> 00:54:55.470
We're fucked.
I know Joe's a Connor is the only fun.
I love every fight.

911
00:54:55.471 --> 00:54:57.420
It's great.
That's all fine and dandy.
Tell you what,

912
00:54:57.421 --> 00:55:01.510
Frankie could go in there and make a nightmare that,
oh yeah,
Frankie,

913
00:55:01.530 --> 00:55:04.290
he would make trouble.
Nightmare.
It's a bad idea.

914
00:55:05.640 --> 00:55:09.840
He's a bad idea for almost everybody.
When you watch his fight with Cub Swanson,

915
00:55:10.200 --> 00:55:14.760
that motherfucker swarms.
He's relentless.
He doesn't get tired.

916
00:55:15.330 --> 00:55:19.810
He just has this most retarded pace.
Who's pace is so fast?

917
00:55:19.860 --> 00:55:23.670
Footwork man and he's better.
He's better now than ever.

918
00:55:23.671 --> 00:55:26.310
Frankie's like never backed off better now than ever.

919
00:55:26.311 --> 00:55:29.400
I think those years out of the championship spotlight too.

920
00:55:29.550 --> 00:55:32.380
I've just made his resolve even stronger.
Yeah.

921
00:55:32.550 --> 00:55:36.120
That's going to meet some good fight that people were totally sleeping on that

922
00:55:36.121 --> 00:55:37.950
Chad Mendez.
Frankie Edgar fight.

923
00:55:37.990 --> 00:55:41.130
I thought I totally forgot about it in December that that whole,

924
00:55:41.160 --> 00:55:46.040
there's a week he worked in all three.
No,
just one.
Yes.

925
00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:49.980
Just for the big dog.
I can't do three in a row.

926
00:55:51.270 --> 00:55:54.660
I wouldn't have a voice left.
That's what I was thinking.
Yeah.
He's screaming.

927
00:55:56.130 --> 00:56:00.630
The third night I be like,
oh,
and then the other main event is page verse rose.

928
00:56:00.870 --> 00:56:03.930
Yeah.
Did you see what happened with Paige and the haircut thing?

929
00:56:04.380 --> 00:56:05.160
I'm going to happen.

930
00:56:05.160 --> 00:56:08.070
Kate page was supposed to like they were going to donate money if they get to a

931
00:56:08.071 --> 00:56:10.370
certain amount just to find to be doing that.
She's waiting.

932
00:56:10.380 --> 00:56:13.110
She got her and she's going to cut her hair up.
So instead she got a haircut.

933
00:56:13.470 --> 00:56:18.280
Like her management team told her to cut her head off.
No,

934
00:56:18.340 --> 00:56:21.060
she's got long hair,
still got trim and she just trimmed her.

935
00:56:21.061 --> 00:56:24.010
It's just like normal shit.
That girl's not mad cause they don't talk about it.

936
00:56:24.011 --> 00:56:27.340
She was like,
I'm just to get it.
It's like I'm going to wash myself for charity.

937
00:56:27.360 --> 00:56:29.740
Well you thought you watched yourself every day.
Fuck you dude.

938
00:56:29.860 --> 00:56:32.890
I'm brushing my teeth with Chitty.
Ah Man.
I'm not mad at it though.

939
00:56:32.920 --> 00:56:37.150
Don't shave your head.
Yeah,
she is.
She came to fun.
She didn't.
She didn't.

940
00:56:37.270 --> 00:56:40.810
That's a tough fight,
man.
So when stars go to fall,

941
00:56:43.790 --> 00:56:44.623
<v 3>yeah,</v>

942
00:56:45.730 --> 00:56:50.110
<v 0>it's a good fight.
Rose's dangerous as fuck.
She is super finisher.</v>

943
00:56:50.830 --> 00:56:54.130
She's tough.
She's wild.
She throws up a lot of wild shit.

944
00:56:54.400 --> 00:56:59.200
I'm not scared to be off her back.
No,
no.
Interesting fight.
Right pages.

945
00:56:59.230 --> 00:57:02.800
Very scrappy to super scrappy.
That's a great fight.

946
00:57:02.950 --> 00:57:06.220
Dominick waters and Dung Young Kim,
this should be a good fight,
man.

947
00:57:07.870 --> 00:57:10.480
This is a good fight too.

948
00:57:10.481 --> 00:57:14.520
Big Tall one seventies like mom,
man,
killer.

949
00:57:16.750 --> 00:57:20.560
I don't know a Dominic waters.
Where does he train?
That's a good question.

950
00:57:21.310 --> 00:57:22.143
Young Jamie,

951
00:57:23.800 --> 00:57:28.240
please pull up the information on Mr. Waters.
Rufus maybe.

952
00:57:28.950 --> 00:57:32.810
Do you see a behind him fighting at Albuquerque?
Some maybe.

953
00:57:33.250 --> 00:57:36.100
Was that Greg Jackson's guys?
Yeah,
that's Isaac Valley.

954
00:57:36.320 --> 00:57:39.080
So they're going to have a game plan for him.
Three

955
00:57:42.630 --> 00:57:47.050
t t t t two submissions.
Hey Man.
Um,

956
00:57:47.510 --> 00:57:51.660
did you notice that um,
Spike TV got rid of Bella tore or got rid of?

957
00:57:51.661 --> 00:57:56.580
I'm not Beltre got rid of a glory.
No.
See what happened?
Yeah.

958
00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:01.710
Yeah.
They got rid of it and ESPN picked it up.
No Way.
Yeah.
Is that better?
No,

959
00:58:02.040 --> 00:58:05.070
not necessarily because I think it's like ESPN too.

960
00:58:05.100 --> 00:58:08.940
I watched the glory fights when they were on ESPN two.
Pretty cool.

961
00:58:08.941 --> 00:58:10.380
But you know,

962
00:58:10.440 --> 00:58:13.980
there's so much shit on ESPN and I don't know how much they're going to like

963
00:58:14.760 --> 00:58:19.350
connect with us via common ESPN intertwined at all.
I don't think so.

964
00:58:19.351 --> 00:58:21.780
I think Viacom's releasing it.
I think glory,

965
00:58:21.810 --> 00:58:25.050
like they had a licensing deal or something like that,
or a broadcast deal.

966
00:58:25.470 --> 00:58:30.450
I think they're owned by different people,
you know?
I just think there's some,

967
00:58:30.690 --> 00:58:34.440
you know,
there's,
there's some fans out there of kickboxing.

968
00:58:34.650 --> 00:58:38.610
Just need to figure out a way to market it and put some money into it and get

969
00:58:38.611 --> 00:58:41.310
people excited about it.
Yeah,
I fucking love it,
man.

970
00:58:41.311 --> 00:58:44.970
I know they were trying to do Bella tour and glory and kind of intertwined some

971
00:58:44.971 --> 00:58:49.560
of the,
the stars in there.
I guess it didn't work out as well as they wanted.

972
00:58:50.250 --> 00:58:54.090
Yeah.
They had that one event where they had the ring right next to the cage,

973
00:58:54.091 --> 00:58:58.110
which is pretty cool.
They tried to do a Japanese style,
you know,

974
00:58:58.170 --> 00:59:00.720
that would have been cool to go to lives on Don Young.

975
00:59:00.721 --> 00:59:04.890
Kim's back Donny on Kim's a nasty grappler.
Danny.
Yeah.

976
00:59:04.891 --> 00:59:09.550
He's doing what Kim does,
but he's interesting too because a lot of,

977
00:59:09.560 --> 00:59:14.420
a lot of judo in his style as well.
Yeah.

978
00:59:14.421 --> 00:59:18.710
I was Daniel and Kim for a Tyrone Woodley when he fought them in China.

979
00:59:18.830 --> 00:59:21.130
Oh really?
Yeah.
Okay.

980
00:59:23.050 --> 00:59:24.370
We both fought on the same day.

981
00:59:25.540 --> 00:59:26.100
<v 3>Okay.</v>

982
00:59:26.100 --> 00:59:28.770
<v 0>Were you in China for that?
No,
I didn't go to China for that.</v>

983
00:59:29.190 --> 00:59:32.950
That was the one where he came charging at him,
right?
Yeah.
He tried to do it.

984
00:59:32.980 --> 00:59:37.170
He's back fist or elbow and got murdered.
Clipped.
Yeah.

985
00:59:37.200 --> 00:59:41.110
Mert just [inaudible] you can't rush it.
That dude.
Hell No.

986
00:59:41.130 --> 00:59:43.050
Wait to explicitly not that first round.

987
00:59:43.051 --> 00:59:46.920
The first round and now he's working with Duke.
Uriel is exactly that.

988
00:59:46.950 --> 00:59:50.010
Well that was what I said.
Oh Shit.
Look at that.
Take down right aside.

989
00:59:50.060 --> 00:59:52.860
Control what I said about uh oh shit fixed.

990
00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:57.080
Tied that arm up with the quickness to mounted crucifix.
Just like that son,

991
00:59:58.280 --> 01:00:02.970
Cade Dworkin and cage.
Oh,
ish.
Don't think so.

992
01:00:02.980 --> 01:00:05.700
He's still near it though.
You got to push off that fucker.

993
01:00:05.701 --> 01:00:09.570
Like you trying to base knocked down a tree.
Oh,

994
01:00:09.571 --> 01:00:11.460
he's going to keep going for the elbow sun.

995
01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:14.313
<v 3>Mm.</v>

996
01:00:16.150 --> 01:00:20.830
<v 0>Um,
well we're just talking about right arm out.
Killer be your card is stacked.</v>

997
01:00:21.130 --> 01:00:25.720
Yeah.
Passing cards.
I'm going to be there for that.

998
01:00:25.810 --> 01:00:29.110
Fuck yeah,
dude.
I'm going to Boston.
You doing stand up at the two?
I would assume.

999
01:00:29.111 --> 01:00:30.970
No,
no man,
I'm actually,
no,

1000
01:00:30.971 --> 01:00:35.670
I already had two things booked already had it Atlanta and um,

1001
01:00:35.980 --> 01:00:38.380
I'm in Atlanta and Tampa that weekend,

1002
01:00:38.860 --> 01:00:42.370
so I have two theaters that are already sold tickets for.

1003
01:00:42.580 --> 01:00:45.430
So then I'm going to fly into Boston on Sundays.
He,
dude,

1004
01:00:45.970 --> 01:00:47.950
my mom took your friend Joe.
My mom goes,

1005
01:00:48.220 --> 01:00:51.940
your friend Joe Rogan's and rolling stone.
Yes ma'am.
He's very famous,

1006
01:00:52.390 --> 01:00:56.860
very famous Mama.
It's been in a bunch of shit.
This is just the start.

1007
01:00:57.970 --> 01:01:02.080
Look at this damn fucking control to get that arm out.
Damn.

1008
01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:03.940
Can you stop it here because it's not really,

1009
01:01:04.540 --> 01:01:09.340
you know what I'm thinking is like fucking them up man.
He can't get his arm out.

1010
01:01:09.341 --> 01:01:12.070
It's weird how he can't get his arm right now.
Great control guys.

1011
01:01:12.071 --> 01:01:14.980
Obviously never spent a lot of time getting out of this,

1012
01:01:15.340 --> 01:01:18.370
but it seems like his strategy of getting out is not so good.

1013
01:01:20.810 --> 01:01:25.050
10 years ago,
some guy was owning people with this in the UFC like 10 years ago.

1014
01:01:25.060 --> 01:01:26.620
Like,
how do you stop it mounted?

1015
01:01:26.621 --> 01:01:30.110
Crucifix Roy Nelson who was before the,

1016
01:01:30.300 --> 01:01:34.700
before that for that Roy was big.
Uh hmm.

1017
01:01:34.970 --> 01:01:36.760
Someone was really,
this is like one of those things.

1018
01:01:36.761 --> 01:01:40.210
You have to stop the fight because he just can't defend himself.
You think?

1019
01:01:40.420 --> 01:01:44.200
Well that's these shots.
Well Roy is a heavyweight though.
That giant belly.

1020
01:01:44.201 --> 01:01:45.540
There's just a guy.
Yeah,
you're not getting at it.

1021
01:01:45.541 --> 01:01:48.840
But this is like very similar to stop the fire,

1022
01:01:49.750 --> 01:01:54.400
stop the fight we you get out of that mounted Crucifix Control that is to that

1023
01:01:54.430 --> 01:01:58.300
position.
Nascar levels and his levels super high.

1024
01:01:58.301 --> 01:02:02.380
You could tell right away.
It was so tight,
so tight.
Good balance.
But it was,

1025
01:02:02.381 --> 01:02:05.320
it seemed like waters had some space where his arm was.
Yeah,

1026
01:02:05.350 --> 01:02:07.630
that's what I was thinking.
Like if it's first round too,

1027
01:02:07.631 --> 01:02:11.290
you're probably going to be trying to score him like he was all hips and trying

1028
01:02:11.291 --> 01:02:13.150
to explore this stuff.
People forget to work on.

1029
01:02:13.510 --> 01:02:16.980
He didn't know how to use his shoulders.
Right.
To copy shoulders up.
Exactly who,

1030
01:02:17.080 --> 01:02:20.010
just Roy have a fight.
Is there any announcement and what's next from boy,

1031
01:02:20.610 --> 01:02:24.390
didn't they announce a Barnett?
Rothwell somebody Photoshop to picture yet.

1032
01:02:24.391 --> 01:02:26.840
He did Barnett.
Rothwell's could that great.

1033
01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:31.260
I like that somebody photoshopped a picture of Roy Nelson with like Akiyama his

1034
01:02:31.261 --> 01:02:33.750
body.
Like that kind of body that is just shredded.

1035
01:02:33.780 --> 01:02:37.230
I don't know whose body they used to Photoshop it,
but it was another fighter.

1036
01:02:37.380 --> 01:02:40.200
But with him with a six pack yoked I was like,
oh my God,

1037
01:02:40.201 --> 01:02:42.870
that's what Roy would look like.
You fought one 85 like,

1038
01:02:42.930 --> 01:02:46.320
I mean it is what it would look like maybe.
I mean when you look at Roy,

1039
01:02:46.410 --> 01:02:50.350
how much weight do you think he could lose?
40 pounds.

1040
01:02:50.610 --> 01:02:55.050
Ten five nine?
Yeah,
about five 11 five 10 yeah.

1041
01:02:55.080 --> 01:02:59.750
40 50 pounds.
How much at that age?
I Dunno.

1042
01:02:59.820 --> 01:03:02.820
I mean,
let's forget about all that mean old people lose weight all the time.

1043
01:03:03.570 --> 01:03:06.770
Like I'll do it like a juice fast.
No age limited.

1044
01:03:06.800 --> 01:03:10.470
[inaudible] you can't like there's the picture.
That's the picture.

1045
01:03:10.500 --> 01:03:14.040
Oh it's Chelsea Manning's body.
Yeah,
look up there.
Look at that picture up there.

1046
01:03:14.340 --> 01:03:18.450
He imagines that shit was real.
Is the guy,
the guy in the back,
right?

1047
01:03:18.510 --> 01:03:21.420
Legit or is that a better shot to,
he's got his dick in his hand.

1048
01:03:21.421 --> 01:03:25.430
If you get lower on the picture of the ground,
the back shale was jacked.

1049
01:03:25.530 --> 01:03:30.000
It looks like Jelly on the phone.
Right?
Like
a hundred pounds.

1050
01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:34.140
You got to see this watch is fucking good though.
That's chill.

1051
01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:35.130
When he was about to fight,

1052
01:03:35.131 --> 01:03:39.540
Anderson was shredded dude look like that and was still knocking bitches out

1053
01:03:39.541 --> 01:03:43.410
like he does.
He would.
Okay.
That's,
yeah,
that's,
he would pay.
That's fucking tough.

1054
01:03:43.620 --> 01:03:47.190
Boy.
That's a big difference.
You'd be a huge star.
Yeah.

1055
01:03:47.550 --> 01:03:51.570
Well I wonder what kind of effect that would have on his performance,

1056
01:03:51.571 --> 01:03:55.210
his whole career he's been carrying around all that extra weight.
Yeah.

1057
01:03:55.560 --> 01:03:58.890
Like that's not outside the realm of possibility that he could actually make

1058
01:03:58.891 --> 01:04:00.990
that weight,
man.
What the,

1059
01:04:01.080 --> 01:04:04.950
I mean it is personality wise and he's choices wise,

1060
01:04:05.070 --> 01:04:07.380
but like as a physical specimen it's not,

1061
01:04:07.410 --> 01:04:11.550
you think he'd get down that without taking performance enhancing drugs and be

1062
01:04:11.551 --> 01:04:16.050
that shredded?
I don't know.
I go and say no.
Well,
I mean,

1063
01:04:16.051 --> 01:04:19.110
what is body fat,
right?
I mean,
you can lose body fat.

1064
01:04:19.111 --> 01:04:23.900
You don't have to be asked to lose muscle though too.
But if he looked like,
Dang,

1065
01:04:23.910 --> 01:04:26.720
you're writing,
probably we're going to lose.
I mean,
you're going to,

1066
01:04:27.070 --> 01:04:30.990
you're going to lose a little muscle,
a lot of fat,
and you get in great shape.

1067
01:04:31.230 --> 01:04:34.200
You know?
It's like,
yeah,
he just eat better.

1068
01:04:36.180 --> 01:04:40.770
If he dedicated himself to strength and conditioning and started running every

1069
01:04:40.771 --> 01:04:44.100
day and doing a bunch of shit.
It's the biggest thing by far.

1070
01:04:45.090 --> 01:04:48.720
If you ever fuck with a ketogenic diet,
if you're fuck with that.
I haven't,
man,

1071
01:04:48.721 --> 01:04:52.870
I did this thing with my DNA.
It's called simplified or yeah,

1072
01:04:52.890 --> 01:04:56.490
simplify genetics where you put your DNA and like a swab.

1073
01:04:56.491 --> 01:04:58.600
They send it to them and it gives a breakdown.

1074
01:04:58.620 --> 01:05:01.440
It's called simply fit where they do like a,

1075
01:05:01.441 --> 01:05:05.100
what kind of weights and cardio should be doing for your body,

1076
01:05:05.190 --> 01:05:08.160
what kind of diet you should be doing that best reacts with your,
you know,

1077
01:05:08.161 --> 01:05:12.450
your DNA.
And,
uh,
they also have one for concussions,

1078
01:05:12.510 --> 01:05:13.350
which was scary,

1079
01:05:13.590 --> 01:05:18.590
where they can tell from your DNA how proned to when you do get a concussion,

1080
01:05:18.701 --> 01:05:21.040
how bad it's going to be on a scale.
One to five.

1081
01:05:21.710 --> 01:05:24.730
Patrick big brown was a for real.
I was scared.

1082
01:05:25.060 --> 01:05:26.320
I wish they didn't send me that one.

1083
01:05:26.410 --> 01:05:30.340
I literally just got the results two days ago.
Oh my God.
I was like,
God damn it.

1084
01:05:30.341 --> 01:05:35.290
I don't need to know that.
That was a four and I'm fucked about you.

1085
01:05:35.350 --> 01:05:36.610
I got 10 years left guys.

1086
01:05:36.611 --> 01:05:39.190
If you're going to shoot some stem cells right into your brain,

1087
01:05:39.220 --> 01:05:43.780
just let him do it.
I'll be the Guinea pig right now,
but up the brain cavity,

1088
01:05:44.230 --> 01:05:46.600
let's do it.
Put a little thin hole there.
It'll show up.

1089
01:05:46.930 --> 01:05:50.530
I'm not mad at that syringe in there.
Pump right in the middle of your brain.

1090
01:05:50.590 --> 01:05:52.240
Boom.
Hopefully,
man,

1091
01:05:52.840 --> 01:05:57.780
you got to go to Germany for the legitimate or is that legit show?
They have it.

1092
01:05:57.781 --> 01:06:01.990
As far as the Santos here now here in La,
dude,

1093
01:06:01.991 --> 01:06:06.540
I had some shot into my shoulder in Vegas.
There were,
they use,
uh,

1094
01:06:06.580 --> 01:06:10.480
women's Placenta.
Women that have sincerity and sections.
They,

1095
01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:14.410
they get stem cells out of their placenta and they shoot it right into your

1096
01:06:14.411 --> 01:06:17.640
shoulder or whatever.
For me,
it was my shoulder,
dude.
I,

1097
01:06:17.650 --> 01:06:19.840
my shoulder was fucking with me for like a year.

1098
01:06:19.841 --> 01:06:22.990
I was real close to getting surgery.
I was like,
this is probably pretty bad.

1099
01:06:23.230 --> 01:06:25.900
I'm like,
it's,
it hurts after every work.
I'd have to put ice on it.

1100
01:06:26.110 --> 01:06:30.010
One stem cell shot,
boom,
done.
Now it's been four months.

1101
01:06:30.190 --> 01:06:32.080
It's getting better.
God Damn Nah,

1102
01:06:32.110 --> 01:06:34.900
that's not like it worked for a little while and then it backed off.

1103
01:06:35.080 --> 01:06:39.500
It's doing something different than all this platelet rich plasma and Regena key

1104
01:06:39.501 --> 01:06:42.610
and things along those lines,
which reduce inflammation,
promote healing,

1105
01:06:42.611 --> 01:06:47.140
and they're very beneficial.
But this is total next level mean women's Placenta.

1106
01:06:47.141 --> 01:06:50.110
What that set you back to 6 million?
What are we talking?
You know what I mean?

1107
01:06:50.660 --> 01:06:54.060
I don't know.
Yeah.
It's hard to get ahold of,

1108
01:06:54.061 --> 01:06:55.810
but I think a lot of women have Syrians.

1109
01:06:55.840 --> 01:07:00.630
I think it's pretty normal when they to save the fat.
Yeah.
Save the Hodor.

1110
01:07:02.890 --> 01:07:07.340
Could a type
cut on your belly.
No big thing.

1111
01:07:07.350 --> 01:07:11.770
They know the things.
Teach those things up good.
I think it happens all the time.

1112
01:07:11.771 --> 01:07:15.460
I don't think it's hard to get those,
um,
those,
those tissues.

1113
01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:17.260
And so they do it and oh,
by the way,

1114
01:07:17.261 --> 01:07:19.180
I got some of these bad ass pickles right here,

1115
01:07:19.181 --> 01:07:22.150
so I know you love those vehicles.
You'll look Grillo's pickles.

1116
01:07:23.710 --> 01:07:27.280
It's never too early for a pickle.
Um,
I ate four of them before you guys got hit.

1117
01:07:27.281 --> 01:07:30.970
Oh Damn.
That's what you had for breakfast.
No,
I haven't had breakfast.
Yeah,

1118
01:07:30.971 --> 01:07:31.751
I mean it's too early.

1119
01:07:31.751 --> 01:07:34.240
I'm not even going to pretend when you make those posts at night,

1120
01:07:34.241 --> 01:07:36.280
if you're fucking elk meat and Moose,

1121
01:07:36.610 --> 01:07:39.640
I have fucking chipotle a or something makes you feel bad about myself.

1122
01:07:39.641 --> 01:07:41.890
I like to cook it when everyone's asleep.
I know.

1123
01:07:41.891 --> 01:07:45.360
It looks so nice when you have eggs and shit.
It makes me so angry.
And they did.

1124
01:07:45.660 --> 01:07:49.960
Didn't you do cranberry sauce that I make today?
Today I made my own home.

1125
01:07:50.020 --> 01:07:54.170
Homemade cranberry sauce.
I was fucking,
it's so easy to do.
Really?
Yeah,

1126
01:07:54.180 --> 01:07:55.930
it's super easy.
And cranberry sauce.

1127
01:07:56.050 --> 01:08:00.800
It's like a two to one water and sugar like uh,
like uh,
uh,

1128
01:08:01.630 --> 01:08:06.470
I think I have uh,
yeah,
I think it was like four cups of coffee.

1129
01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:11.320
Two cups of cranberries,
one cup of sugar and one couple.
It's all sugar.

1130
01:08:11.380 --> 01:08:15.470
You're not going to be like sex bitch.
How do you the air here?

1131
01:08:15.471 --> 01:08:18.710
This is crazy weird man bro.
This is madness.

1132
01:08:19.340 --> 01:08:20.870
He was on TV and he's right here.

1133
01:08:21.280 --> 01:08:24.680
There's Rogan's fucking cram as my cranberry sauce.
Look at that.

1134
01:08:24.681 --> 01:08:28.010
I made that shit.
Do something.
I have to stop following you at night.

1135
01:08:28.011 --> 01:08:30.770
I'm like fuck it.
I just,
I just send that though.

1136
01:08:30.770 --> 01:08:32.700
Postmates go pick me up some food to it.

1137
01:08:32.701 --> 01:08:34.960
If we were neighbors I would have you come over and eat some.

1138
01:08:34.970 --> 01:08:38.720
Hell I'd be over in the middle of the night.
Oh,
you would love it too,
by the way.

1139
01:08:38.750 --> 01:08:41.660
I got this water to commercial freezers here cause I,

1140
01:08:41.661 --> 01:08:44.690
I shot so much elk this year.
I got some elk for you.
Oh,
I'm not mass.

1141
01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:47.600
I have some right here.
Be Dope Man.
I got something for you too,
Eddie.

1142
01:08:47.601 --> 01:08:50.220
But I don't know if you're going to eat it.
He won't eat it.
Why not anyone?

1143
01:08:50.230 --> 01:08:53.290
Just like you have to heal each chipolte leg or my big push you do.

1144
01:08:53.291 --> 01:08:56.720
You know Joe Polian and that equalize shit going on right now.

1145
01:08:56.721 --> 01:09:00.200
If you liked your pull a fucking go there.
It's like the Wa dead.

1146
01:09:00.290 --> 01:09:03.320
No one's there because equalize stuff.
Oh,

1147
01:09:03.321 --> 01:09:07.440
cause they had an Ecolab ecolab everywhere.
Every,
all in,
in,
uh,

1148
01:09:07.460 --> 01:09:10.460
it's like all over the shutting them down and shit.
Really?

1149
01:09:10.810 --> 01:09:14.000
There's that many of them that are having problems really trouble.

1150
01:09:14.210 --> 01:09:16.010
Jamie's nodding.
Whoa.
That's not good.

1151
01:09:16.130 --> 01:09:18.710
I mean there used to be a line out the door.
I want that the other day.

1152
01:09:18.711 --> 01:09:23.180
There's no,
we know what it is.
Scared.
Don't know what it is.

1153
01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:25.820
They don't know what started that first couple of stores that found,

1154
01:09:25.821 --> 01:09:27.600
then they stripped him clean,
clean them on it.

1155
01:09:27.610 --> 01:09:31.270
Then they couldn't find the trace trickling over.
Right.

1156
01:09:31.290 --> 01:09:34.730
In Ohio it's been like seven or eight states.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I get equal.

1157
01:09:34.780 --> 01:09:36.020
I every time I eat there,

1158
01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:40.830
every time he did,
you love it.

1159
01:09:42.360 --> 01:09:46.220
We'll get that fucking card son.
Dude.
Sousa.
Romero who,

1160
01:09:46.330 --> 01:09:50.840
what's your love that
fight?
Yeah.
I just wished that you bro.

1161
01:09:50.870 --> 01:09:55.710
Yo Al was younger.
You know,
I feel like we're getting this super athlete,

1162
01:09:55.830 --> 01:09:59.510
one of the greatest wrestlers of all time and we're getting them deep into his

1163
01:09:59.511 --> 01:10:03.530
career.
He's got a guy beat Cael Sanderson twice,
you know,

1164
01:10:03.531 --> 01:10:06.790
I mean Yo Romero was a monster athletes.
Super.

1165
01:10:06.791 --> 01:10:10.070
We're getting him at like 36 when they have the most stringent testing.

1166
01:10:11.180 --> 01:10:15.810
It's so unfortunate.
It's like giving a Sammy Sosa now I'm good.

1167
01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:20.360
You know,
it's like I did this um,
interview medic beast.
Yeah.

1168
01:10:20.361 --> 01:10:22.110
Oh he is for sure.
Goddamn we,

1169
01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:25.330
that combination that's front kicks the body in that left hand columns.

1170
01:10:25.350 --> 01:10:29.960
That mother Fucker,
Dude.
Motherfucker,
you said motherfuckers fucked at one 45.

1171
01:10:30.200 --> 01:10:33.410
He's a beast,
dude.
He's a beat Weidman.

1172
01:10:33.411 --> 01:10:38.411
Rock guys know that rot ride man stopped drinking and now he weighs 190 pounds.

1173
01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:43.940
Damn.
He's waking up in the morning at one 93 said he said he's a,

1174
01:10:43.980 --> 01:10:46.820
he's essentially a welter weight.
Stop Drinking,

1175
01:10:48.430 --> 01:10:49.520
stop drinking booze.

1176
01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:53.180
Started eating really healthy and he's coming into this fight really lean.

1177
01:10:53.420 --> 01:10:58.360
I think he maybe anticipates like a serious pace or maybe it could.

1178
01:10:58.430 --> 01:11:00.530
It's a weight cut.
Yeah.
Yeah.
With the IB,

1179
01:11:00.650 --> 01:11:02.570
I think this is the hardest fight to call from me.

1180
01:11:02.630 --> 01:11:06.020
I think it's the greatest fight in middleweight history.
It's a great fight.

1181
01:11:06.410 --> 01:11:06.831
You know,

1182
01:11:06.831 --> 01:11:11.831
the only thing that it would be the greatest all time fight if Rockhold didn't

1183
01:11:12.351 --> 01:11:14.490
have that fight Vietor Ah,

1184
01:11:14.630 --> 01:11:17.070
<v 2>c'mon.
Towards an asterick.
It is.
It is.</v>

1185
01:11:17.220 --> 01:11:21.150
But when v tour we'll kicked him in the head and stopped him in the first round

1186
01:11:21.151 --> 01:11:25.950
like that.
It did sort of change the perception of Roscoe.
What you're saying.

1187
01:11:25.980 --> 01:11:28.660
I just liked that school rating.
Yeah.
Like they're,

1188
01:11:28.710 --> 01:11:32.210
both of them are ever going to be this good again,
I don't think,

1189
01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:37.400
I think the trick is so strong to TRT years of veto or are so it's such just

1190
01:11:38.100 --> 01:11:38.850
the,

1191
01:11:38.850 --> 01:11:43.590
I'm so torn more than on any other fighter because I think like Trt v Tor is

1192
01:11:43.591 --> 01:11:45.390
probably like one of my all time favorite fighters.

1193
01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:47.310
It might be my favorite fighter.
Just like right.

1194
01:11:47.410 --> 01:11:51.340
Taking guys eyes off straight up.
He's like one of my all time favorite.

1195
01:11:51.430 --> 01:11:55.980
This Jon Jones beat him sauce out of his mind.
That's,
that's fucked up.

1196
01:11:56.010 --> 01:11:59.820
I like Anna drawl veto when he was 19 when he had the traps that did you guys

1197
01:11:59.821 --> 01:12:01.010
hear and no technique.

1198
01:12:03.240 --> 01:12:06.510
50 leads to heavy hand shit.

1199
01:12:08.490 --> 01:12:10.860
He was like a lion who's built like a lion.

1200
01:12:12.990 --> 01:12:17.880
Is Muscle started at the top of his head.
His went straight down like ski ramps.

1201
01:12:17.910 --> 01:12:20.670
Did you see that Jon Jones interview?
Yeah.

1202
01:12:20.671 --> 01:12:24.300
Well I think Jon Jones has a really good point that someone in the athletic

1203
01:12:24.301 --> 01:12:26.040
commission,
Whoever's responsible,

1204
01:12:26.160 --> 01:12:30.510
didn't tell him that Victoria had tested positive or that he had tested with

1205
01:12:30.511 --> 01:12:34.290
elevated test levels.
They didn't tell him and they let him fight.
You fight.

1206
01:12:34.350 --> 01:12:37.830
If that's true.
He's got a legit shoe.
And he goes,
oh no,

1207
01:12:37.831 --> 01:12:41.700
I have three years to press charges.
He goes,
don't worry.
I'm not forgetting.
Yeah,

1208
01:12:41.701 --> 01:12:45.330
well he shouldn't.
Whoever did that,
whether it's the athletic commission,

1209
01:12:45.331 --> 01:12:49.620
whatever,
who,
who's responsible at that point in time?
Who's responsible?

1210
01:12:49.650 --> 01:12:53.010
I think it's a combo of things.
Is it the UFC and the athletic commission?

1211
01:12:53.070 --> 01:12:57.900
I think so.
But how your people or you'd have to be,
you know,
ridiculous.

1212
01:12:57.901 --> 01:13:01.490
If you don't think of the UFC brass knew what Vittorio was doing.
Well,

1213
01:13:01.491 --> 01:13:05.160
wasn't this a time where Vito took the fight on short notice because Chael

1214
01:13:05.160 --> 01:13:08.590
Sonnen was that the same fight knows different funds,
different a fight.
I'm mean,

1215
01:13:08.600 --> 01:13:11.160
I'm confused.
He's that fight actually didn't happen.
Yes,

1216
01:13:11.220 --> 01:13:15.030
and people gave John a lot of shit,
which by the way,
in any other sport,

1217
01:13:15.270 --> 01:13:18.480
in any other sport.
Yeah,
it was Dan Harrington.
In any other sport,

1218
01:13:18.810 --> 01:13:20.340
that would be a ridiculous thing to ask.

1219
01:13:20.880 --> 01:13:25.140
Dick does to ask Miguel Cotto last minute to not fight Canelo Alvarez,

1220
01:13:25.141 --> 01:13:26.730
but to fight Floyd Mayweather.
Everybody was like,

1221
01:13:26.731 --> 01:13:30.560
what the fuck are you talking love John's explanation.
It's like,
no man,
I took,

1222
01:13:30.740 --> 01:13:33.780
there's so many years of training to get to world Chaim ship level and then you

1223
01:13:33.781 --> 01:13:36.450
want me to do this,
and he goes and then you're making me look like an asshole.

1224
01:13:36.660 --> 01:13:37.890
That's not cool,
man.
Boy,

1225
01:13:37.920 --> 01:13:41.850
he gave chill fucking beating after that because all the shit and shale was

1226
01:13:41.851 --> 01:13:43.080
talking.
Oh my God.

1227
01:13:43.110 --> 01:13:47.940
He gave him such a beating that he broke his own toe pushing off the mat while

1228
01:13:47.941 --> 01:13:51.360
he's beating the fuck out of him.
Dude hop,
I'm up in the interview.
He's like,

1229
01:13:51.540 --> 01:13:52.231
yeah,
you know,

1230
01:13:52.231 --> 01:13:55.670
now I'm just going to start taking this serious and start training.
Oh God,

1231
01:13:55.740 --> 01:14:00.270
fuck no.
Good luck to you buddy.
You watching all this power lifting going,

1232
01:14:00.300 --> 01:14:03.810
Ooh,
don't get hurt.
You know like you really,
I'm like,
Oh shit.

1233
01:14:03.811 --> 01:14:08.640
He's training like professional athlete now.
True.
What block?
Dead lifting.

1234
01:14:08.641 --> 01:14:12.010
400 squat and 500 and he's dead lifting 600

1235
01:14:12.100 --> 01:14:16.730
<v 0>is he think he's going for his,
his Max on Monday.
How much does he might run it?</v>

1236
01:14:16.731 --> 01:14:20.140
Not a fan boy at camp.
I'm a fan boy,

1237
01:14:21.130 --> 01:14:25.660
but next Monday the big 600 pound dead lift is scheduled for Monday,

1238
01:14:26.980 --> 01:14:28.850
but he's going to watch his weight if you stay until

1239
01:14:30.580 --> 01:14:35.250
two 28 shredders to 2028 so he's lost body fat.
Yes.

1240
01:14:35.530 --> 01:14:39.790
Shred that factor in that extra muscle and his endurance.

1241
01:14:40.210 --> 01:14:42.650
I mean it's going to,
it's more of a requirement,
right?
I,

1242
01:14:42.651 --> 01:14:45.160
I think it's going to help him cause he's,
he's going to be stronger.

1243
01:14:45.161 --> 01:14:46.420
He's never been a knockout guy,

1244
01:14:46.421 --> 01:14:50.120
but we see maybe a little more knockouts and he's also not being the guy who,

1245
01:14:50.121 --> 01:14:52.840
who,
who's trained outside camp now he's training.

1246
01:14:52.841 --> 01:14:55.540
So I think his body's going to adapt to it.
I think he's built for it man.

1247
01:14:55.930 --> 01:14:58.380
Wow Man.
He talked about going to heavyweight too.
I was going to say,

1248
01:14:58.390 --> 01:15:03.100
or he does because he said it's just a matter of time.
The weight cut fuck.

1249
01:15:03.101 --> 01:15:06.050
Especially with the IVS and whatnot because I know he was talking about it for a

1250
01:15:06.051 --> 01:15:06.371
while.

1251
01:15:06.371 --> 01:15:10.570
Going to heavyweight and he probably cuts a lot and that's probably a pretty

1252
01:15:10.571 --> 01:15:15.040
hard cut.
So big,
big fight,
right,
is Weidman.
If Weidman can beat Rockhold,

1253
01:15:15.041 --> 01:15:16.960
which is obviously a big,
if that's a big fine.

1254
01:15:17.560 --> 01:15:22.560
Rodman Weidman beats Rockhold and Jon Jones and Weidman hookup in Madison Square

1255
01:15:23.620 --> 01:15:26.680
Garden.
Good fucking googly Mooglie

1256
01:15:29.090 --> 01:15:33.550
look at the difference.
There's a John Jones a before and after picture.

1257
01:15:33.551 --> 01:15:36.190
We're looking at all over the Internet of him,
dude,

1258
01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:38.860
where he's like a add a shape in between camps.

1259
01:15:38.861 --> 01:15:43.861
For one fight and like I think that was 2013 and then 2015 he's on the right and

1260
01:15:44.351 --> 01:15:45.700
just looks like the hulk dude.

1261
01:15:45.701 --> 01:15:48.250
He said when he was fighting Alexander and he was like,
yeah,
that's,
you know,

1262
01:15:48.251 --> 01:15:51.910
the first time I was tired of the fight cause I really didn't train what the

1263
01:15:51.911 --> 01:15:55.090
fuck.
And this dude's still goes into the octagon confident.

1264
01:15:55.750 --> 01:15:59.740
It's insane how talented that dude is.
He's super talented,
that's for sure.

1265
01:15:59.741 --> 01:16:01.930
Bruton Forman.
Um,

1266
01:16:02.070 --> 01:16:05.410
I'm interested to see what's going to happen with this.
Um,

1267
01:16:06.190 --> 01:16:11.120
with this v tour thing.
If they really did know that he had elevated test level,

1268
01:16:11.140 --> 01:16:14.740
I'm sure nothing to come out until after he's done fighting.
Because if,
you know,

1269
01:16:14.741 --> 01:16:18.220
when you look at the fight,
Jon got continent deep arm bar in that.
Yes.

1270
01:16:18.250 --> 01:16:19.390
And what if his arm broke?

1271
01:16:21.380 --> 01:16:24.100
But what if it broke and what if that like fucked up his career.

1272
01:16:24.220 --> 01:16:28.690
And then we found out that Victoria had elevated test levels of a law suit on

1273
01:16:28.691 --> 01:16:31.810
your motherfucking hands.
It's all very crazy,
man.

1274
01:16:31.840 --> 01:16:35.870
It's a very strange time because I feel like,
you know there's,

1275
01:16:35.920 --> 01:16:40.150
they're saving the blood and they're saving the urine for years.

1276
01:16:40.151 --> 01:16:44.950
I think like eight years and how many people are d they're getting by on the

1277
01:16:44.951 --> 01:16:46.540
sneak tip with some,

1278
01:16:46.600 --> 01:16:49.480
some shit that they haven't figured out that what are you going to do with that,

1279
01:16:49.481 --> 01:16:53.630
say blood and urine like eight years from now?
The Shit on legends?
Yes.

1280
01:16:53.930 --> 01:16:57.220
That's fucked up,
man.
That's what they did kind of fucked up.

1281
01:16:57.400 --> 01:17:01.060
That's gotta be fucked up.
Oh,
you're out of the sport.
You're a commentator now.

1282
01:17:01.061 --> 01:17:03.150
You got wife and kids.
Check this out.
Here's this.

1283
01:17:03.230 --> 01:17:05.050
We're just going to shit on everything you've ever done.
I mean,

1284
01:17:05.051 --> 01:17:09.070
there's probably going to be a lot of extra blood that's unnecessary then.
Right?

1285
01:17:09.080 --> 01:17:14.080
Because how many fighters are probably going to get that in seven years from now

1286
01:17:14.091 --> 01:17:17.810
then we'll do well fun.
What's going to happen is when sophisticated testing,

1287
01:17:18.220 --> 01:17:22.400
when when improves,
when it gets better and better,
then they're going to go,

1288
01:17:22.401 --> 01:17:25.190
oh well now like they,
you didn't use to be able to test for EPO.

1289
01:17:25.191 --> 01:17:28.810
They didn't used to be able to test for h g h is a real recent one,
right?
Yeah.

1290
01:17:29.330 --> 01:17:31.010
And now apparently there's a,

1291
01:17:31.340 --> 01:17:35.690
there's a new version of artificial testosterone that they're getting from

1292
01:17:35.691 --> 01:17:38.840
animals.
They're not getting it from yams anymore.

1293
01:17:38.841 --> 01:17:41.240
They were getting it somehow or another from wild yams.

1294
01:17:41.270 --> 01:17:44.070
I'll let him know I'm too fucking stupid for this.

1295
01:17:44.510 --> 01:17:49.130
But now apparently they're figuring out how to extract it from animals and when

1296
01:17:49.131 --> 01:17:51.470
they give it to people,
it doesn't show up.

1297
01:17:51.730 --> 01:17:56.030
It's like the carbon isotope test doesn't show up.
But wouldn't your,

1298
01:17:56.060 --> 01:17:59.180
your levels would still be elevated?
Yeah,
you'd have high levels,

1299
01:17:59.510 --> 01:18:02.390
but they would be,
even though they were high,

1300
01:18:02.600 --> 01:18:05.090
they would still be human level.
Oh,
Gotcha.

1301
01:18:05.150 --> 01:18:07.220
Like when they do that carbon isotope test,

1302
01:18:07.221 --> 01:18:11.280
apparently they test it and they can tell.
They're like,
oh motherfucker,

1303
01:18:11.360 --> 01:18:15.500
you got yams running through your veins.
Well,
my thing is I,
so,

1304
01:18:15.501 --> 01:18:18.860
so you're gonna store all this blood and shit like that for eight years.

1305
01:18:19.010 --> 01:18:22.100
You could you tell me a guy tested positive at eight years from now.
I'm like,

1306
01:18:22.101 --> 01:18:25.970
what dude?
Who's been watching this shit?
[inaudible] who's been dealing with it.

1307
01:18:26.330 --> 01:18:28.970
Yeah.
Has it been,
they have,

1308
01:18:30.290 --> 01:18:35.290
they have a facility where they have like a chain of custody and they have 24

1309
01:18:35.301 --> 01:18:39.080
hour security cameras and uh,
you know all that good shit,
dude.

1310
01:18:40.150 --> 01:18:44.440
I don't,
I dunno.
I don't trust it and make it shut up.
[inaudible]

1311
01:18:44.970 --> 01:18:49.150
qualities.
The same people.
They do the Olympics or that's what Wata is,
you know,

1312
01:18:49.160 --> 01:18:53.610
that's what the u s USAID Da Dude,
we have the strictest testing of any sport,

1313
01:18:53.720 --> 01:18:57.280
any sport by far.
But you know,
intense.
You know what?
Hey,

1314
01:18:57.300 --> 01:18:59.490
maybe focus on the fight.
Gets the testing.

1315
01:18:59.491 --> 01:19:01.670
At least let the fights have love the UFC.

1316
01:19:01.671 --> 01:19:06.130
At least you're talking about Reebok Brown area.
Well,
I mean,

1317
01:19:06.140 --> 01:19:08.250
let's put a little money into that.
Huh?
Fuck the testing.

1318
01:19:09.050 --> 01:19:11.810
They spelled most of the people's names,
right.
Give them some breaks.

1319
01:19:11.990 --> 01:19:12.823
You're right,
man.

1320
01:19:12.920 --> 01:19:16.250
They put on it for Connor shirt and they put the u s flag on it.

1321
01:19:17.230 --> 01:19:19.670
Conor McGregor.
Yeah,
they did.
Yes,
they did know.

1322
01:19:19.671 --> 01:19:22.010
They did real Fantic picture on it cause he,

1323
01:19:22.011 --> 01:19:26.180
I think he's from Ireland but the Conor Mcgregor Jersey flagging this,

1324
01:19:26.330 --> 01:19:27.740
this can't be right.
Is it?

1325
01:19:28.200 --> 01:19:31.370
Isn't it weird that all this shit that Reeboks taken on their designs and they

1326
01:19:31.371 --> 01:19:36.230
still haven't changed anything by now,
they would've changed the goddamn design.

1327
01:19:36.260 --> 01:19:40.400
That's their problem.
Huge problem.
But if you say,
if you change the design,

1328
01:19:40.401 --> 01:19:43.430
you have to admit that it sucked.
What's wrong with that?
Oh our bad.

1329
01:19:43.431 --> 01:19:45.290
We didn't realize this is going to suck balls so bad.

1330
01:19:46.250 --> 01:19:49.030
You just got to get used to this.
No you can't.

1331
01:19:49.040 --> 01:19:53.540
You got to get used to that fighting with white shorts on so that as soon as
her,

1332
01:19:53.541 --> 01:19:56.240
any blood or their junk gets outlined,

1333
01:19:56.990 --> 01:19:59.930
their ass looks like they shit themselves cause they just running around on the

1334
01:19:59.931 --> 01:20:03.140
on the ground.
Dude.
Why not just be like,
oh my bad,
my bad.
We fucked up.

1335
01:20:03.141 --> 01:20:05.660
Here's the new one that we've been working on.
We spent way more time on this.

1336
01:20:05.690 --> 01:20:08.220
I think they said it's a,
it's a two year process.

1337
01:20:08.221 --> 01:20:12.750
Like every two years they're going to change the style,
evolve the,

1338
01:20:13.200 --> 01:20:15.450
the uniform.
You know what I think they should eliminate,

1339
01:20:15.480 --> 01:20:18.150
they should eliminate shorts.
Make everybody fight with tights on.

1340
01:20:18.510 --> 01:20:21.360
I get annoyed when dudes grabbed shorts.
I'm like,

1341
01:20:21.361 --> 01:20:24.610
why do they have something to grab like a,
you know,
don't grab a shorts.

1342
01:20:24.620 --> 01:20:26.670
Don't grab a short.
It's like why is that an option?

1343
01:20:26.671 --> 01:20:29.790
Why is it an option to grab when the tights though?

1344
01:20:29.970 --> 01:20:31.680
Cause they don't like the way they look.
Yeah.

1345
01:20:32.040 --> 01:20:35.360
They don't want anybody to see there that you talked to.
The guy was tired.

1346
01:20:35.361 --> 01:20:39.460
So I like to let my shit out.
Hey everyone.

1347
01:20:39.550 --> 01:20:42.440
Ha Ha.
Don't act like you're not a bro.

1348
01:20:43.740 --> 01:20:46.300
Benson Henderson love this dude.
Yeah,

1349
01:20:46.530 --> 01:20:49.680
I liked him at one 72 they what's interesting,
a lot of people don't know this.

1350
01:20:49.681 --> 01:20:53.430
This is his last fight on the UFC contract.
This is his last fight.

1351
01:20:53.640 --> 01:20:58.090
The last fight.
You know,
if someone like him went over to Bellator,

1352
01:20:58.390 --> 01:21:01.350
that would make a big noise.
You know,
they've got Phil Davis,

1353
01:21:01.380 --> 01:21:05.100
which I think made some good noise,
you know.
But if they can get like,

1354
01:21:05.220 --> 01:21:07.990
can you imagine?
Imagine.
Imagine.

1355
01:21:08.020 --> 01:21:10.650
What about Jon Jones contract goes up.

1356
01:21:10.920 --> 01:21:13.920
He's a judge Jones bales and goes over to Bella tour.

1357
01:21:14.620 --> 01:21:19.540
[inaudible] that what if Ron was did lord?
Oh good Lord.
Rhonda did.

1358
01:21:19.710 --> 01:21:24.030
Oh good Lord.
If that was the game plan,
Dana White's head would explode.

1359
01:21:24.510 --> 01:21:26.070
It would be like that movie scanners.

1360
01:21:26.130 --> 01:21:28.180
You might take a little big and make your brain explode.

1361
01:21:28.181 --> 01:21:32.820
The staring at you that Jake Dan to be at a press conference and boom,

1362
01:21:33.480 --> 01:21:35.700
and then Conor McGregor Neves leaves the next day

1363
01:21:37.230 --> 01:21:39.990
his brain pulls back together and then explodes again.

1364
01:21:42.960 --> 01:21:46.590
Paul,
if Viacom really wanted like they have so much money,

1365
01:21:46.620 --> 01:21:51.150
if they really wanted to sink in and just blow like a couple hundred million

1366
01:21:51.150 --> 01:21:54.930
bucks and go look,
which is fucking take over this bitch,
it's make it spike TV,

1367
01:21:54.931 --> 01:21:58.890
MMA.
That'd be how many people do you think they could do that too?

1368
01:21:58.950 --> 01:22:01.140
How many people would take the chance?

1369
01:22:01.530 --> 01:22:04.260
You'd have to give him so much money that they don't ever have to fight again.

1370
01:22:04.290 --> 01:22:07.950
I agree that that,
okay.
Yeah.
You'd have to give each guy like Benson Anderson,

1371
01:22:08.130 --> 01:22:11.160
you have to give them like 3 million bucks.
It's just not the same.

1372
01:22:11.161 --> 01:22:12.630
Like you're just,
even if you have all that money,

1373
01:22:12.631 --> 01:22:15.240
you're just never going to be the same superstar over there.
It's just,

1374
01:22:15.300 --> 01:22:17.790
it doesn't last.
Everybody jumped ship.

1375
01:22:17.820 --> 01:22:20.100
It would have to be like almost like a mass exodus.

1376
01:22:20.160 --> 01:22:22.710
Well then belt or it needs to do a lot of things different,

1377
01:22:22.740 --> 01:22:25.830
but you have to stop calling it Bella tour for rails.
Come on man,

1378
01:22:25.831 --> 01:22:28.420
and that Shitty logo.
We've got to figure this out.
Benson,

1379
01:22:28.560 --> 01:22:31.590
that was up in the air like when it got taken over by Scott Koger.

1380
01:22:31.591 --> 01:22:33.590
They weren't sure if they were going to keep up.
Bellator.

1381
01:22:33.610 --> 01:22:37.770
MMA should have asked bigger town straight advice.

1382
01:22:38.590 --> 01:22:42.090
No matter what you call it does not.
It kind of does marketing wise,

1383
01:22:42.120 --> 01:22:45.760
knowing that does marketing does bands,
you can call,

1384
01:22:45.761 --> 01:22:49.710
you don't call this UFC anymore.
Call a Kissy Kissy POW.
Pow.
Yeah.

1385
01:22:49.711 --> 01:22:51.120
Let me know how that goes.
Yeah,

1386
01:22:51.270 --> 01:22:55.800
exact time for the Kissy kissy power world championships,
brandings,

1387
01:22:55.801 --> 01:22:56.341
everything.

1388
01:22:56.341 --> 01:23:01.341
My man name who didn't even heard of a Bella tour before and yet to grow hootie

1389
01:23:03.721 --> 01:23:07.880
and the blowfish.
You know what I mean?
It doesn't matter.
Tompkins.

1390
01:23:07.900 --> 01:23:10.720
It doesn't matter where they know.
Where is it?
Where are they now?
What does,

1391
01:23:10.721 --> 01:23:12.580
who do you know?
Who needs the fucking country singer?

1392
01:23:12.580 --> 01:23:15.760
Cause that shit don't work out.
And he changed his name.
His name is Daryl now.

1393
01:23:16.180 --> 01:23:20.410
His name is Daryl.
He loves country music is a huge country star.
Real.

1394
01:23:20.411 --> 01:23:24.940
His name's Darryl.
Wow.
One hit right?
That one,
that one album,

1395
01:23:24.941 --> 01:23:27.880
I think pretty much.
They have a lot of countries.

1396
01:23:29.710 --> 01:23:33.940
They were gigantic with slightly overweight white girls.
It's true.

1397
01:23:35.880 --> 01:23:40.630
That puts where they did their best damage.
They're good songs,
man.

1398
01:23:40.631 --> 01:23:42.700
Who did the blowfish?
We're good.
And I'll tell you what,
man,

1399
01:23:42.701 --> 01:23:45.630
that Guy Darrius Rucker,
right?
That's serious.
That's right.

1400
01:23:45.700 --> 01:23:47.980
He's great fucking Royce Ma'am.

1401
01:23:48.090 --> 01:23:52.600
And the country music people,
they needed a guy like him.
Like see,

1402
01:23:52.601 --> 01:23:56.230
we're diverse shit.
You mean a black guy?
Joe,
shut the fuck up.

1403
01:23:57.040 --> 01:24:01.270
You said that guy like a pop singer.

1404
01:24:02.220 --> 01:24:06.940
He's
fucking Hendrix of country.

1405
01:24:06.970 --> 01:24:10.180
Yo look out yoked.
Benson looks hooks yoked.

1406
01:24:11.380 --> 01:24:15.790
Who looks good man at one 70 and not having to destroy his body anymore.

1407
01:24:16.360 --> 01:24:21.280
Five nine is that short for one 70 not doing Johnny Hendricks.
I think it's five.

1408
01:24:21.281 --> 01:24:23.320
Eight.
How about Johnny changing camps?

1409
01:24:23.380 --> 01:24:27.450
He's leaving team because team take them.
That's it.
All this money into him,

1410
01:24:27.451 --> 01:24:29.650
right?
Like built them up.
I don't know how that works.

1411
01:24:29.680 --> 01:24:34.510
How's cause it was a bunch of different versions of how I got 50 50 I deal.

1412
01:24:34.660 --> 01:24:39.190
I'm pretty sure you like they gave him a salary and then they would get 50% of

1413
01:24:39.191 --> 01:24:44.191
his salary that they took care of like a house to live in basically.

1414
01:24:46.390 --> 01:24:50.480
Well who knows at this point you become a champion.
Champion.

1415
01:24:51.190 --> 01:24:55.570
50 fuck.
You might have bought a house.
This is a good fight,
man.
Great fight.

1416
01:24:55.840 --> 01:24:59.070
This is a real your dogs.
One of my favorite fighters to watch.
He's very crafty.

1417
01:24:59.140 --> 01:25:01.600
He was one of those old school,
uh,

1418
01:25:01.750 --> 01:25:06.460
brawlers of Kimbo brawlers with Kim and Miami man.
I've seen him.

1419
01:25:07.300 --> 01:25:09.370
I like watching him fight man.
He's very smart.

1420
01:25:09.490 --> 01:25:13.420
He's phenomenal striker and I think at one 70,
again,

1421
01:25:13.421 --> 01:25:16.250
he's a guy who doesn't have to hurt his body to fucking make that weight.

1422
01:25:16.270 --> 01:25:16.710
I agree.

1423
01:25:16.710 --> 01:25:20.290
We're going to see that more and more like Robert Whitaker when he fought Uriah

1424
01:25:20.291 --> 01:25:23.410
hall.
Like that's three in a row.
Five true.

1425
01:25:23.590 --> 01:25:25.480
A lot of people were saying he's too small for 85,

1426
01:25:25.481 --> 01:25:28.330
three in a row at 85 looks awesome.
Yeah.

1427
01:25:28.331 --> 01:25:31.720
Really good power of striking mosfet all slick,

1428
01:25:31.900 --> 01:25:35.410
super slick man and good transitions between striking grappling.

1429
01:25:35.411 --> 01:25:37.120
But Benson is such a good grappler.

1430
01:25:37.300 --> 01:25:40.510
I'm interested to see like where this takes place.
Ben's and spent,
you know,

1431
01:25:40.511 --> 01:25:44.680
bent and uh,
outside can't spends all his time in the GE does it.
Yes.

1432
01:25:45.070 --> 01:25:45.903
Interesting.

1433
01:25:48.310 --> 01:25:52.260
John Crouched from that old school Gracie lineage to John Crouch.

1434
01:25:52.290 --> 01:25:56.230
My first Jujitsu coach.
Really?
I held the door open for Ben.

1435
01:25:56.680 --> 01:26:01.480
He wasn't,
he was just getting ready to fight,
pursuing it and uh,

1436
01:26:02.680 --> 01:26:05.690
you know,
walked in.
We trained together then this is no light.

1437
01:26:05.691 --> 01:26:09.770
Next time I saw him we were both in UFC signing posters.
Wow.

1438
01:26:09.800 --> 01:26:14.610
Just a good dude,
man.
Great Guy.
Settle legs on him.

1439
01:26:14.800 --> 01:26:18.480
Yeah,
he's,
yeah,
he's like keeping it in kicking distance.
Ooh,
Nice.

1440
01:26:18.481 --> 01:26:22.770
Right hand Benson's keeping it in his distance and Mosfet I was trying to close

1441
01:26:22.771 --> 01:26:26.370
it out.
Oh,
nice shot by Mosfet.
I'll write to the body and the right hand.

1442
01:26:26.440 --> 01:26:30.450
I'd give the striking edge has Woodall but doesn't look like you so far.
Well,

1443
01:26:30.451 --> 01:26:33.330
so far Benson was keeping him on the outside,
but that combination,

1444
01:26:33.331 --> 01:26:36.510
that right kick to the body and right hand that had some fucking steam on it.

1445
01:26:36.770 --> 01:26:41.610
Mosfet I was throwing heat,
man.
He's throwing hard shots so it bends.

1446
01:26:41.611 --> 01:26:44.550
Try knock his ass out too though.
I've got switch kick too.

1447
01:26:45.670 --> 01:26:46.503
<v 3>Yes.</v>

1448
01:26:46.820 --> 01:26:51.080
<v 0>Mosfet also had some knee problems.
So many guys have knee problems,
ma'am.</v>

1449
01:26:51.500 --> 01:26:55.910
So common dude.
And these are nothing to fuck with either.
You know,

1450
01:26:55.911 --> 01:26:58.220
a lot of times it ruins NFL guys careers.
Call Him.

1451
01:26:58.221 --> 01:27:01.900
He ain't got his knee shot up with the stem cells.
Boom says he's all good,
right?

1452
01:27:01.950 --> 01:27:04.940
Yeah,
no surgery.
He was ready to get surgery was thinking about it.

1453
01:27:06.250 --> 01:27:10.760
That stem cells.
It's motherfucker dude.
And this is just the beginning.
Oh,

1454
01:27:10.761 --> 01:27:14.810
vice counter.
Right.
Great.
Chatbook yeah.
Dude.
How bout,
uh,

1455
01:27:15.470 --> 01:27:19.520
what if they did DC John Jones,
mass square guy.
Good fucking Lord.

1456
01:27:19.521 --> 01:27:23.680
That's a great fight.
Is it a great fight?
I love that.
Yeah.

1457
01:27:23.690 --> 01:27:28.310
Because I think the DC gets a second chance.
DC,
uh,
more,
uh,

1458
01:27:28.400 --> 01:27:33.350
more experienced and I'm not gonna fall for the emotional roller coaster ride

1459
01:27:33.351 --> 01:27:35.210
that he got in with John.
Uh,

1460
01:27:35.240 --> 01:27:39.470
it's probably going to stay calm and also doesn't,
uh,
you know,

1461
01:27:39.471 --> 01:27:40.640
his knees not as fucked up,

1462
01:27:40.641 --> 01:27:44.240
but did I learn these young with Denny's dealing with a focus?
John,

1463
01:27:44.510 --> 01:27:48.950
who's like not doing coke three weeks out and already been already beat up too.

1464
01:27:48.951 --> 01:27:52.410
You know,
already beat him.
That's fine.
It has to happen.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh,

1465
01:27:52.430 --> 01:27:55.970
it's happening.
It's happening.
For sure.
That's the next fight for dcs,
John.

1466
01:27:56.040 --> 01:27:58.940
That's a guaranteed to happen.
I'm just saying at Madison Square Garden,

1467
01:27:58.941 --> 01:28:02.040
will it happen?
Give it to John John's right away.
Dot.

1468
01:28:02.041 --> 01:28:05.120
Madison Square Garden is not,
it's not definitely,
you know,

1469
01:28:05.121 --> 01:28:06.200
it's definitely not definite.

1470
01:28:06.290 --> 01:28:09.470
I think they have to jump through a lot of hoops before April and making it

1471
01:28:09.471 --> 01:28:12.260
difficult and it's our,
oh shit.
Oh,

1472
01:28:12.261 --> 01:28:14.840
he caught him with the right hand and that was right when Mazda,

1473
01:28:14.860 --> 01:28:17.120
when I was going with that right kick to the body again too.

1474
01:28:18.090 --> 01:28:18.923
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1475
01:28:19.680 --> 01:28:23.220
<v 0>Madison Square Garden.
UFC would be fucking insane.
Insane.
It would be.</v>

1476
01:28:23.221 --> 01:28:25.800
And so you've got to stack that card like this December card.

1477
01:28:25.980 --> 01:28:29.580
You got to just bring the no past and no,
no,
they're still,

1478
01:28:29.581 --> 01:28:32.640
it's crazy that it's not.
Oh Nice.
Left to the body.

1479
01:28:32.641 --> 01:28:36.030
You hurt him with that left hand or the body mosfet all sneaky.

1480
01:28:36.080 --> 01:28:39.270
How's think that's,
I can tell an elite striker,
when you see guys go to the body,

1481
01:28:40.470 --> 01:28:42.690
that was perfect placement to phenomenal

1482
01:28:45.430 --> 01:28:49.380
Muscovy doll.
Oh,
acts crazy.
There's that.

1483
01:28:49.630 --> 01:28:51.160
He keeps landing that right.
Cute.

1484
01:28:51.161 --> 01:28:54.250
Cause we'll mix it up in his Jujitsu is sneaky on the ground,
man.

1485
01:28:55.750 --> 01:28:59.380
Who leg kick that lesson for him?
God Damn,

1486
01:28:59.381 --> 01:29:02.340
he's opening up.
Yeah.
That was like five in a row.

1487
01:29:03.470 --> 01:29:04.303
<v 3>Yeah.
Rolling</v>

1488
01:29:07.050 --> 01:29:10.080
<v 2>pins.
Heroes gets in his fucking face.
He's always touching it.</v>

1489
01:29:10.110 --> 01:29:12.510
You said who was he fighting?
He was fighting.

1490
01:29:12.600 --> 01:29:14.910
Was it Frankie when you'd pull his hair back?

1491
01:29:14.911 --> 01:29:16.890
Frank would jump on her mirror that.
Yeah.

1492
01:29:16.950 --> 01:29:20.970
Pounce and they were timing it after the first fight.
It was a nice leg kick.

1493
01:29:21.030 --> 01:29:25.020
I wonder if want to notice how much he touches his hair really should cut it
off.

1494
01:29:25.410 --> 01:29:30.330
He's a corn row it.
Well,
something it just gets so in the way.
Whatever you do,

1495
01:29:30.331 --> 01:29:32.250
stop doing what you're doing.
Yeah.

1496
01:29:33.120 --> 01:29:35.760
There's one more thing that he doesn't have to think about.
I agree.

1497
01:29:35.940 --> 01:29:39.350
That's what rose cut her hair.
Right?
Should I send the way?
Fuck this noise.
Yeah.

1498
01:29:41.760 --> 01:29:46.380
I mean it's crazy.
That page wouldn't do it.
Burrows is equally pretty.

1499
01:29:46.770 --> 01:29:50.730
She's beautiful bro.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Rosa super.
She actually,

1500
01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.400
she actually pulls the shaved head off.
She has some,
oh,

1501
01:29:53.640 --> 01:29:57.680
he nailed them on that knee going down now son.
Look,
get that.
Maybe itch.

1502
01:29:57.720 --> 01:30:01.890
Don't think so.
Damn takedown defense mom.
Look at them.

1503
01:30:02.070 --> 01:30:04.320
Super Confident.
He's laughing.

1504
01:30:05.080 --> 01:30:05.913
<v 3>Dude.</v>

1505
01:30:10.350 --> 01:30:14.970
<v 2>Do Ben ones.
This one is second big win at one 70 I mean he's right up there,
man.</v>

1506
01:30:14.971 --> 01:30:18.360
You got to give a guy like that.
This is five rounds to men.

1507
01:30:18.750 --> 01:30:23.010
We just watch round one.
And who do you think won that round?

1508
01:30:23.580 --> 01:30:28.470
If you had a judge,
the doll mosfet [inaudible]
if that's a ten nine round,

1509
01:30:28.471 --> 01:30:32.970
how is Frankie Edgar versus gray Maynard?
You guys should be put down.

1510
01:30:33.290 --> 01:30:36.900
I should be putting like a horse with three broken legs.

1511
01:30:39.330 --> 01:30:40.820
What happened?
Right?

1512
01:30:41.020 --> 01:30:46.020
Get Frankie Edgar got cracked in the first round where he was down multiple

1513
01:30:46.051 --> 01:30:49.560
times.
We'll completely wobbled,
looked like it was out to,

1514
01:30:49.690 --> 01:30:54.090
it's a ten eight round of five Evers and I'd be surprised if you told me ten six

1515
01:30:54.091 --> 01:30:56.400
Oh yeah,
I'm cool with that.
Ten nine I'm like fuck.

1516
01:30:56.401 --> 01:30:58.980
He tried to tell him it was ten nine because the end of the round Frankie had

1517
01:30:58.981 --> 01:31:01.290
recovered.
I'm like,
you just need to shut your mouth dude.

1518
01:31:01.370 --> 01:31:04.110
If we were in a restaurant and he told him that I'd piss in his mouth,

1519
01:31:04.170 --> 01:31:07.220
I would have stood on the table and piss right on his mouth.
Wow.
Yeah.

1520
01:31:07.221 --> 01:31:10.160
You're at rest bro.
[inaudible] your yard

1521
01:31:12.810 --> 01:31:15.880
like a lion round dose.

1522
01:31:16.020 --> 01:31:19.680
How about Ben Henderson had a big fucking Joe rigs in his corner.

1523
01:31:20.270 --> 01:31:23.790
Old School.
Well diesel's been trained with them,
right?
Yeah.
Yeah.

1524
01:31:23.791 --> 01:31:28.680
He was in a Riggs.
Is Corner against me.
Is Rigs in the UFC?
Um,

1525
01:31:28.860 --> 01:31:32.370
is he still in the UFC is lost his last fight?

1526
01:31:33.830 --> 01:31:38.010
No,
he lost the Cote de Right?
Yeah.
Was that the last fight?
I think so.

1527
01:31:38.370 --> 01:31:43.140
He'd won one before that.
Right?
Who did he fight?
Ron Stallings.
Dan,

1528
01:31:43.141 --> 01:31:47.250
you know Patrick?
Oh,
taste for steam all cutie.
I mean,
people take that dude,

1529
01:31:47.940 --> 01:31:51.690
you know this?
Yes.
Quebec.
You're not white.
You're not,

1530
01:31:51.691 --> 01:31:55.680
might hates mosfet dolls landing that right.
Kick to the body a lot.

1531
01:31:56.130 --> 01:32:00.190
That's a good kick for him,
man.
Dude.
His striking,
I mean,
top

1532
01:32:00.190 --> 01:32:04.270
<v 0>notch,
man,
that makes very crisp.
I'm not mad at it's fade either on his,
yeah.</v>

1533
01:32:05.950 --> 01:32:09.130
I'm also not matter.
It's takedown defense.
That was really impressive.

1534
01:32:09.900 --> 01:32:12.010
That was impressive.
Banking gets you down.

1535
01:32:13.660 --> 01:32:17.920
He's like roommates with Colby Covington.
Fuck Dude.

1536
01:32:18.190 --> 01:32:19.900
You have that guys like your,

1537
01:32:20.050 --> 01:32:23.470
your favorite training partner and you're going to get good at wrestling,
man.

1538
01:32:23.620 --> 01:32:27.730
Well they have monsters that att right.
Wrestlers.
I mean,
it's just full of that,

1539
01:32:28.090 --> 01:32:32.470
but definitely I am,
man.
He brought his game up.
Gym kicked to the body.

1540
01:32:32.500 --> 01:32:36.100
Have you seen the new one?
Dan Lambert has opened up a new giant.
A t.
T.

1541
01:32:36.101 --> 01:32:39.620
Have you been in coconut creek?
I haven't been to the new one.
Um,
oh,

1542
01:32:39.770 --> 01:32:43.450
shut up buildup.
Is he her?
He did.
He's hurt leg.

1543
01:32:44.130 --> 01:32:49.120
Someone bleeding.
Something happened.
Is that from old?
That Akiyama was button.
Oh,

1544
01:32:49.121 --> 01:32:53.050
his daughter says nasty brownies.
Nope.
Maslow dolls.

1545
01:32:53.060 --> 01:32:57.750
Darcy's are fucking nasty man.
He got a Cisa with a dark,
we were talking,

1546
01:32:57.760 --> 01:33:01.370
we missed the Ya know,
yet Cisa with the AH,
Jeez.

1547
01:33:01.480 --> 01:33:06.250
Oh my God.
Oh Shit.
Oh Man.

1548
01:33:06.251 --> 01:33:10.420
They're throwing down.
Damn Mazda doll.

1549
01:33:11.560 --> 01:33:16.540
I love his movement,
man.
His head mom,
he's always moving.
He's sharp.
Very sharp.

1550
01:33:16.660 --> 01:33:20.410
Very sharp.
I never root against Bendo though.

1551
01:33:21.580 --> 01:33:26.430
What did I wonder if there's any benefit of having all that hair for sure not.

1552
01:33:26.440 --> 01:33:29.650
I was thinking the comfort factor.
You guys were saying,
Oh he needs to shave it.

1553
01:33:29.651 --> 01:33:33.250
But like if you're in the fight and you like,

1554
01:33:33.251 --> 01:33:36.640
he keeps a toothpick and if you get used to just moving your hair back,

1555
01:33:36.641 --> 01:33:39.820
maybe that's Kinda like your reset in your head.
You.
It's like,
okay,

1556
01:33:39.821 --> 01:33:40.840
I'm just chilling out,

1557
01:33:40.880 --> 01:33:44.020
get in my breath back and then you're coming with the combos.
Who knows,
man.

1558
01:33:44.260 --> 01:33:47.050
On a psychological level it could be their true.
He's so,

1559
01:33:47.051 --> 01:33:49.640
you'd be like a comfort zone thing.
Guys are timing it.

1560
01:33:49.641 --> 01:33:51.730
Like Frankie Edgar timed it when he would touch his here.

1561
01:33:51.850 --> 01:33:56.050
Frankie would fucking come at on the toothpick thing is so insane.

1562
01:33:56.290 --> 01:33:59.650
The fact that he's fought world championship fights with a toothpick stuck

1563
01:33:59.680 --> 01:34:03.560
inside of his mouth.
That is weird.
It's just like a comfort thing.

1564
01:34:04.280 --> 01:34:07.330
Some people use their breathing as a comfort thing to relax their breath and be

1565
01:34:07.331 --> 01:34:08.800
like,
all right,
I'm good,
I'm safe.

1566
01:34:09.160 --> 01:34:11.740
I go back to my breathing and he does a toothpaste.

1567
01:34:11.800 --> 01:34:13.210
Some people think that chilling,

1568
01:34:13.270 --> 01:34:17.230
like I had an old Japanese surfer stoner,

1569
01:34:17.680 --> 01:34:22.230
a student named Yoshi and he still rolling.
Did you get to and chew gum?

1570
01:34:22.250 --> 01:34:26.830
He said that that that when you're chilling it keeps you sharper.
Yeah.

1571
01:34:26.831 --> 01:34:30.010
A lot of people believe that.
A lot of people would play pool that chew gum.

1572
01:34:30.040 --> 01:34:33.940
Really?
Yeah.
Another thing I've heard is that when you chew gum before something,

1573
01:34:33.941 --> 01:34:38.110
it's good because your body relaxes because it says,
well,
we can't be in danger.

1574
01:34:38.111 --> 01:34:41.460
This mother fucker wouldn't be eating day.
Um,
yeah,

1575
01:34:42.110 --> 01:34:46.440
that might choose grow side,
wrong size

1576
01:34:49.060 --> 01:34:52.470
or maybe maybe to the fullest.
There's some more bro.
Science.

1577
01:34:53.060 --> 01:34:56.410
She guy's full of shit.
You're sharper because your body is going.

1578
01:34:56.411 --> 01:34:58.130
This motherfucker's eat and he's vulnerable.

1579
01:34:58.130 --> 01:35:00.280
<v 2>You better keep those senses on point because Ryan,</v>

1580
01:35:00.290 --> 01:35:04.480
I get attacked by some a wolverine and makes sense for sure,
bro.
Science,
but

1581
01:35:07.490 --> 01:35:08.950
science to a new place.

1582
01:35:12.410 --> 01:35:17.120
I'm going to go with that.
Oh Man.
This is a good fight,
man.
Ooh,

1583
01:35:17.121 --> 01:35:17.954
Nice Jab.

1584
01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:21.833
<v 4>Ooh.</v>

1585
01:35:24.980 --> 01:35:28.220
<v 2>I'd love to see what kind of contract belt or offers.
Ben,
after this,</v>

1586
01:35:29.390 --> 01:35:34.390
do you think they're going to offer him 110% what if it loses the,

1587
01:35:34.491 --> 01:35:37.280
Oh shit.
He's still from teen.

1588
01:35:37.700 --> 01:35:41.720
<v 4>Oh No,
no more
interesting.
Yeah.</v>

1589
01:35:41.760 --> 01:35:43.070
I wonder why you abandoned that,

1590
01:35:44.940 --> 01:35:48.470
<v 2>but he's going back to it.
Maybe he likes it on the right side better.
Oh Shit.</v>

1591
01:35:49.100 --> 01:35:52.900
Maybe he likes it on the right side better and all he lost transitions.

1592
01:35:53.350 --> 01:35:57.510
Nasty.
Oh Man.
It was a bad idea.
I hate this.

1593
01:35:58.110 --> 01:35:58.950
I hate this.

1594
01:35:59.040 --> 01:36:03.960
[inaudible] he's lifting him up and Neiman the Fed.

1595
01:36:03.980 --> 01:36:07.800
Talk about the veteran.
Talk about a veteran fucking move.
That's a great move.

1596
01:36:07.830 --> 01:36:10.890
Hell yeah.
That's a good move because that position is terrible.

1597
01:36:10.891 --> 01:36:13.560
The touch can't grouch,
man.
People touch the ground.

1598
01:36:13.561 --> 01:36:16.870
You can't name in the head if you don't know what we're talking about.
Oh Shit.

1599
01:36:17.160 --> 01:36:21.870
He fucked his face hands,
son.
Mosfet all face is a mess now from those knees.

1600
01:36:23.390 --> 01:36:27.630
That was some slick shit.
That was pretty slick.
Hell yeah.
That was dope.

1601
01:36:28.170 --> 01:36:32.970
I just think that that relying on that,
it's crazy.
It is crazy.
And the the,

1602
01:36:32.971 --> 01:36:34.890
that gray area where it's the transits,

1603
01:36:34.900 --> 01:36:38.040
you're touching you again in the face and they stop it.
Stupid.

1604
01:36:38.530 --> 01:36:39.363
<v 4>Stupid.</v>

1605
01:36:40.730 --> 01:36:44.220
<v 2>I liked what herb dean does.
Herb deem someone is doing that and they get nailed.</v>

1606
01:36:44.221 --> 01:36:46.970
He goes,
you're playing the game and you tell him don't play it again.

1607
01:36:47.060 --> 01:36:51.560
Herb's the best Combo,
man.
God Damn.
What the fuck on round.

1608
01:36:52.730 --> 01:36:57.680
Yeah.
Great.
Main event too.
Dude.
Why am I the one was pissed.

1609
01:36:57.980 --> 01:37:02.980
No one drink as much coffee as conditioned for this shit.
For Real.

1610
01:37:02.981 --> 01:37:06.160
My body's gotten so used to it.
I go three rounds.

1611
01:37:06.550 --> 01:37:11.550
I'll be drinking coffee three hours and then he'd just do you just go real a

1612
01:37:12.191 --> 01:37:14.230
piss it when you get out of this ridiculous back.

1613
01:37:14.231 --> 01:37:15.390
Where's all that piss coming from?

1614
01:37:17.830 --> 01:37:19.600
Raging River after a storm.

1615
01:37:21.090 --> 01:37:25.590
<v 5>Ah,</v>

1616
01:37:26.170 --> 01:37:29.340
<v 2>dude.
Hell,
how come they don't have the roundup there?
That's all they do.</v>

1617
01:37:29.341 --> 01:37:33.930
The through how they do this weird dashes on the bottom here.

1618
01:37:33.931 --> 01:37:37.500
Bull and they're white and it blends in with the ring.
Yeah.
That's a little odd,

1619
01:37:37.501 --> 01:37:40.770
isn't it?
How about the number three you fucks about round to,

1620
01:37:40.810 --> 01:37:45.180
how about the cow up?
The sponsors in Korea.
How about the sponsor?

1621
01:37:45.510 --> 01:37:49.980
The main sponsor was that massage chair.
It's in the middle.
Okay.

1622
01:37:49.981 --> 01:37:53.640
Is one of the other ones.
Whatever.
Okay.
Is See out there.
That's the shit.

1623
01:37:55.380 --> 01:37:59.430
It's like water
soccer.
Rub a water shirt.

1624
01:38:02.570 --> 01:38:06.690
Interesting.
This is an interesting fight,
right?
Yeah.
Really good fight man.

1625
01:38:07.110 --> 01:38:10.170
Back and forth.
Hard to hard to judge.
I like a fight.

1626
01:38:10.171 --> 01:38:12.270
Like this being five rounds to fuck.
Yes.

1627
01:38:12.271 --> 01:38:14.220
Cause it's going to get more clear as these rounds go on.

1628
01:38:14.460 --> 01:38:16.620
Who the judges are from,
where did they fly him in?

1629
01:38:16.630 --> 01:38:20.570
Are we talking about some Korean judges?
That's a good question.
Since sexy.

1630
01:38:20.571 --> 01:38:21.301
I'm a lost,

1631
01:38:21.301 --> 01:38:26.301
I got assume they're not Korean because Korea is like notoriously bad for or

1632
01:38:26.491 --> 01:38:29.970
known for bad decisions because of the Roy Jones Jr fight.

1633
01:38:30.310 --> 01:38:32.580
Remember when Roy Jones Jr fought in Seoul,

1634
01:38:32.581 --> 01:38:35.550
South Korea in the finals of the Olympics,

1635
01:38:35.730 --> 01:38:39.540
lit that dude up like a fucking Christmas tree in Times Square and they gave it

1636
01:38:39.541 --> 01:38:43.650
to the Korean.
That's ridiculous.
I remember that.
And then the Olympic Committee,

1637
01:38:43.860 --> 01:38:47.530
they got in trouble and there's all this like allegations of bribery.

1638
01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:51.630
Oh it was so obviously dirty.
It was so obviously dirty.

1639
01:38:51.631 --> 01:38:52.590
You go and watch that fight.

1640
01:38:52.770 --> 01:38:57.770
Roy Jones jr Roy Jones Jr and he still lost decision.

1641
01:38:57.990 --> 01:39:01.320
It was awful.
It was awful.
I've seen it in uh,

1642
01:39:01.920 --> 01:39:06.540
in taekwondo tournaments too.
Heavy favoritism.
At least they used to.
In boxing,

1643
01:39:06.541 --> 01:39:08.980
it's the worst in boxing.
You never know what the fuck's it.

1644
01:39:09.020 --> 01:39:11.160
[inaudible] in the Bradley out fight.

1645
01:39:11.161 --> 01:39:14.850
We just saw it tonight is Vladimir Klitschko and Tyson fury.

1646
01:39:14.880 --> 01:39:18.750
That's a fucking fight.
Fight.
Anything outside fight.

1647
01:39:18.850 --> 01:39:22.200
Helia fury.
He's undefeated and not to mention this,

1648
01:39:22.201 --> 01:39:25.650
the first fight or that Klitschkos face that's bigger than yeah,
taller.

1649
01:39:25.651 --> 01:39:29.400
Those almost knocking dudes out.
Yeah.

1650
01:39:29.401 --> 01:39:33.210
This is VR and has a really high work rate.
Yes,
a dude.

1651
01:39:33.211 --> 01:39:35.730
So I think Klitschkos going to beat fury.

1652
01:39:35.910 --> 01:39:39.090
The fucking fight is this monster,

1653
01:39:39.240 --> 01:39:43.590
this dime piece of a man in England named Joshua.
He's it.

1654
01:39:43.620 --> 01:39:47.140
He won gold in the Olympics.
You got to see this dude.
Who is he?
He's he.

1655
01:39:47.190 --> 01:39:49.410
I think he's six,
seven light on his feet.

1656
01:39:49.411 --> 01:39:52.810
Athletic knocking dudes out on defeated.
I'm really Helen healthy.

1657
01:39:52.811 --> 01:39:56.400
This is the next motherfucker.
What's his name?
Joshua.
We'll bring him up.
Joshua.

1658
01:39:56.401 --> 01:39:59.970
He's,
I forget his first name.
He's a heavyweight from ohs.
Last name.
What is it?

1659
01:39:59.971 --> 01:40:03.450
James.
Joshua.
Joshua.
Anthony.
Joshua.
And where's he from?
England.
Wait,

1660
01:40:03.451 --> 01:40:06.630
do you see this dude?
He's,
he has charisma.
He's marketable.

1661
01:40:06.660 --> 01:40:09.000
He's knocking dudes out.
He's athletic is fucked.

1662
01:40:09.001 --> 01:40:12.050
Brendan Schaub moving into sports management to tell you why.

1663
01:40:12.990 --> 01:40:17.130
What do you see this dude though?
I'm up,
Jamie.
I want to say,
oh my God.

1664
01:40:17.730 --> 01:40:21.360
That's a real dude.
That's a real dude.
One goal.
Put a super heavyweight.

1665
01:40:21.390 --> 01:40:25.290
Pull up a video of him boxing.
Let's show a video of him box.
He's athletic,
man.

1666
01:40:25.530 --> 01:40:29.400
What's his name?
Anthony.
Joshua.
Anthony.
Joshua.

1667
01:40:30.180 --> 01:40:34.200
How many fights is you have so far wins a super heavyweight boxing.
Let's not.

1668
01:40:34.230 --> 01:40:36.600
Oh Shit.
Look at them and bought and the Olympics.

1669
01:40:37.430 --> 01:40:40.650
Give us a highlight on my son's.
Let's get this hype train started.

1670
01:40:41.130 --> 01:40:45.990
Get those guns though.
Serious Jab.
Ooh,
good fundamentals.

1671
01:40:48.690 --> 01:40:50.390
See if you can find like a professional by day.

1672
01:40:50.391 --> 01:40:54.130
Y'All highlights so Mazda dog or kicked in the balls.
Desert

1673
01:40:54.310 --> 01:40:56.590
<v 0>timing sells.
Paul kicking festival.</v>

1674
01:41:00.180 --> 01:41:03.510
That looks like a,
a Olympic boxing,
bro.
See if you can find one.

1675
01:41:03.511 --> 01:41:07.980
That's a professional fight.
He's doing MMA now.
No,
no,
no,
no.
He's,
he's he's box.

1676
01:41:07.981 --> 01:41:11.460
I don't think he's the next guy to compete with those guys.
Okay.
Here's him.

1677
01:41:11.590 --> 01:41:15.840
Oh Jesus.
For how big he is,
man.
We got all those people.

1678
01:41:15.850 --> 01:41:17.220
That crowd is crunk is fuck,

1679
01:41:20.780 --> 01:41:25.230
I
had such a great statement.

1680
01:41:26.610 --> 01:41:30.590
Crowd is looking at that dude's body.
He should deter.
I did.
Did,
did,

1681
01:41:30.591 --> 01:41:34.950
did the did interesting.
Well that's what they've been waiting for,
right?

1682
01:41:35.430 --> 01:41:39.060
Oh my God,
look at,
he works out like a pro athlete too,
for sure.

1683
01:41:39.061 --> 01:41:43.470
Don't show us him on the quad machine.
Boy highlight reel.
Nah.

1684
01:41:46.300 --> 01:41:48.370
So who's winning this fight?
We need to pay attention.

1685
01:41:48.371 --> 01:41:52.540
The last wine Joshua came in and this round,
I'm not sure.

1686
01:41:53.620 --> 01:41:55.660
So right now you believe one on one?
Yeah,

1687
01:41:56.860 --> 01:41:58.720
though we did drop him in the first round.

1688
01:41:58.721 --> 01:42:02.080
I would imagine he finished strong mosfet all in the first round.

1689
01:42:02.081 --> 01:42:05.590
So they would give it to him.
So maybe one,

1690
01:42:05.980 --> 01:42:09.140
two rounds to Mosfet all of that.
That's what I would say with

1691
01:42:10.930 --> 01:42:13.240
Henderson,
wasn't it?
Yes.
That's why B two to one.

1692
01:42:13.300 --> 01:42:16.450
So I'd give that probably the first round of Mazda doll third round.
Uh,

1693
01:42:16.510 --> 01:42:19.990
even though it got knocked down,
he didn't finish that strong.
I mean,
he beat him.

1694
01:42:19.991 --> 01:42:23.190
Right?
That's why I don't know.
But it would be more realistically,

1695
01:42:23.920 --> 01:42:27.310
we shouldn't score when we're not even paying any attention.
This is broken.

1696
01:42:27.520 --> 01:42:32.490
This is Bros for pro score.
Yeah,
this is Bruce going out.

1697
01:42:32.500 --> 01:42:32.951
It's fine.

1698
01:42:32.951 --> 01:42:36.970
Watched five minutes of this fight in its entirety once I've seen about a minute

1699
01:42:36.971 --> 01:42:40.070
20 of this and I do like the way mosfet all moves man.
Ooh.

1700
01:42:40.090 --> 01:42:43.940
Is that kick to the body?
His control and distance are really good too.

1701
01:42:44.220 --> 01:42:48.850
And knowing when to hit that switch kick when he's really tall.
Yeah man.

1702
01:42:49.510 --> 01:42:50.950
It's a festival.
It's a dick.

1703
01:42:53.410 --> 01:42:54.610
<v 3>Good time for a piss break though.</v>

1704
01:42:56.720 --> 01:43:01.260
<v 0>Jesus Christ Benson,
he's still sitting on is on the bottom going to say.</v>

1705
01:43:01.880 --> 01:43:03.270
I was going to say that was pretty interesting.

1706
01:43:03.271 --> 01:43:06.920
And they gave him a stool to sit in while they waited for is the end of the

1707
01:43:06.921 --> 01:43:11.600
fight.
Oh,
the round.
But look at this.
Oh that was totally accidental.

1708
01:43:11.930 --> 01:43:15.150
They clashed knees and it went right into the g

1709
01:43:18.770 --> 01:43:23.300
Oh time man.
Okay.
That was it.
Yeah,
time in.
But it was one second.

1710
01:43:23.620 --> 01:43:25.750
Okay,
so then they bring the corners.

1711
01:43:25.790 --> 01:43:28.610
So was it the end of the fight or end of the round?

1712
01:43:30.700 --> 01:43:31.533
<v 3>It's just,</v>

1713
01:43:33.120 --> 01:43:36.870
<v 0>it's interesting that more people don't wear those compression shorts like</v>

1714
01:43:36.871 --> 01:43:41.190
diamond m and makeups,
which is amazing.
They're amazing.
Amazing.

1715
01:43:41.220 --> 01:43:44.190
But it's very rare like fighters,
a lot of them don't even know about them.

1716
01:43:45.040 --> 01:43:49.890
A lot of guys like the Tie Steel Cup.
Do you like to Tie Steel Cup?
Uh,
no.

1717
01:43:50.040 --> 01:43:51.950
No,
it was 50 50.

1718
01:43:51.951 --> 01:43:55.730
Another thing you always got to worry about when you're dealing with those is if

1719
01:43:55.731 --> 01:43:59.900
by any way it does pincher or naked,

1720
01:43:59.930 --> 01:44:04.650
you're still getting,
see now you're getting that smashed by the cup itself.
Yeah,

1721
01:44:05.470 --> 01:44:09.110
but a couple of balls.
Yeah,
I do.
They can.

1722
01:44:09.140 --> 01:44:12.560
The edge of your balls can get caught with a cop on a guy like Gilbert.

1723
01:44:12.561 --> 01:44:15.170
I'm also office.
So awful.

1724
01:44:17.780 --> 01:44:19.260
So what,
what uh,

1725
01:44:19.310 --> 01:44:23.780
kind of cup prevents that is there or it doesn't matter.
The diamond club,

1726
01:44:23.810 --> 01:44:26.300
honestly,
he hooked me up when I went to Chicago.

1727
01:44:26.750 --> 01:44:28.940
He gave me one and I was the first time I ever used it.

1728
01:44:28.941 --> 01:44:32.030
And it do your balls get pinched?
No,
I love it.

1729
01:44:33.250 --> 01:44:37.590
It feels phenomenal.
Diamond Cup ever made.
Okay,

1730
01:44:37.820 --> 01:44:42.610
so what do they do differently that that prevents the ball's being crazy setup

1731
01:44:42.620 --> 01:44:46.340
with the compression shorts and all these straps and everything and then the cup

1732
01:44:46.341 --> 01:44:50.810
itself as like soft on the outside on the edges where it like connects to your

1733
01:44:50.811 --> 01:44:53.990
leg but then hard everywhere else and it's regular cup.

1734
01:44:53.991 --> 01:44:58.770
That's a real good junior.
All American football.
A little bit of friend steal it.

1735
01:44:58.820 --> 01:45:02.590
Never use one of those diamond ones.
Never.
I got one for you.
I never use comp.

1736
01:45:02.591 --> 01:45:06.710
Do you want one?
Oh,
you don't want your at work?
I don't either.
So okay.

1737
01:45:06.770 --> 01:45:10.820
I like my balls hanging Dick swingers.
Me Too.
Goddamn Dr. Rough my shit up.

1738
01:45:10.821 --> 01:45:13.070
Like a callous telling you man.
This diamond ones,

1739
01:45:13.071 --> 01:45:15.530
you won't even notice it and it will protect your Dick.

1740
01:45:15.620 --> 01:45:19.930
My knees are always pretend you're drilling armbars yeah,
Dick.
Hey,

1741
01:45:19.970 --> 01:45:21.680
you'll enjoy.
Well,

1742
01:45:21.681 --> 01:45:25.490
the other thing about the tie cups where the people would use them for leverage

1743
01:45:25.491 --> 01:45:26.870
like they would say that,
ah,
yeah,

1744
01:45:27.040 --> 01:45:29.930
a leverage point for an arm bar or something like that.

1745
01:45:30.200 --> 01:45:33.290
It's like you have a rock there.
You could break a stick over,
you know,

1746
01:45:33.291 --> 01:45:36.200
it's like it's not back mount with a body triangle.

1747
01:45:36.590 --> 01:45:40.160
She's like hit in the spine or mount like sometimes people mount you and
they'll,

1748
01:45:40.190 --> 01:45:43.510
they'll grape grapevine or they'll,
yeah,
they'll,
they'll get that.

1749
01:45:43.750 --> 01:45:46.700
That Dick Right on your sternum called the Dick Grinder.

1750
01:45:48.380 --> 01:45:53.150
They get pressed the hard steel right in your solar plexus.
That sucks dude.

1751
01:45:54.160 --> 01:45:54.993
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1752
01:45:55.120 --> 01:45:59.820
<v 0>He keeps doing that.
A bonus single.
I know that he also,
what Eddie,</v>

1753
01:46:03.260 --> 01:46:05.230
Eddie,
you need get on one of these natural things.

1754
01:46:05.740 --> 01:46:07.420
Be able to wake your ass right.
Yeah.

1755
01:46:07.421 --> 01:46:11.430
You fucking around with that wide awake Tuesday.

1756
01:46:11.540 --> 01:46:14.770
I already drank a cup of coffee and I was like,
how does,

1757
01:46:14.800 --> 01:46:18.190
how does that compare to that?
To that?
I did a podcast,
which is fucked.

1758
01:46:18.280 --> 01:46:21.340
I did a podcast with take two weeks ago.
I am not exaggerating.

1759
01:46:21.400 --> 01:46:26.320
I think he drank for these during the podcast.
He was so,
any had coffee,

1760
01:46:26.321 --> 01:46:29.670
regular cross talking like just wouldn't shut the fuck up.
He couldn't,

1761
01:46:29.700 --> 01:46:34.300
he was like,
he's on cocaine.
Guy Is fucking crazy beard.

1762
01:46:34.301 --> 01:46:38.770
He's an animal.
Was all excited about everything.
Super doozy asked him.

1763
01:46:39.430 --> 01:46:44.430
He's a super busy as he's on crank natural coffee breaks her about everything.

1764
01:46:45.720 --> 01:46:46.850
Fuck yeah,
man.

1765
01:46:50.340 --> 01:46:54.870
<v 2>I love best days the best.
He's such a fun guy.
He said,</v>

1766
01:46:54.910 --> 01:46:59.910
I like vibrant guy like so happy and fucking,
and he'll get deep.

1767
01:46:59.911 --> 01:47:00.760
You will get d.

1768
01:47:00.870 --> 01:47:04.110
We got a slice of pizza the other day and this full fucking sat me down and got

1769
01:47:04.170 --> 01:47:07.180
deep.
I was like,
damn man,
I'm just trying to eat my pizza.

1770
01:47:07.210 --> 01:47:10.290
Get the fucking Benson with the tape.
Oh Shit.
Lost.

1771
01:47:11.040 --> 01:47:13.860
Lost that last bit out on top.
Looking for that Darcel again.

1772
01:47:14.260 --> 01:47:17.570
He was nasty with it,
man.
He likes to up front show for sure.
And fight bend.

1773
01:47:17.580 --> 01:47:22.230
There you go.
There you're actually two feet.
Nice.
Oh,

1774
01:47:22.231 --> 01:47:25.410

Oh Great.
Elbows.
Oh,

1775
01:47:26.070 --> 01:47:29.750
he's a little more polished,
right with his,
uh,
his combinations.
Yeah.

1776
01:47:29.751 --> 01:47:33.540
Especially more fluidity to a mosfet dolls.
Punching dude.

1777
01:47:33.541 --> 01:47:38.040
Ben's here is out of control now.
Oh,
that was perfect timing.

1778
01:47:38.100 --> 01:47:42.270
Nice timing.
That's like Dow right back up to his feeds.
All Greasy.

1779
01:47:42.360 --> 01:47:47.130
The mosfet doll is nasty.
He's a motherfucker nasty.
Did you know?

1780
01:47:47.131 --> 01:47:50.630
I wouldn't mind seeing it,
although Ben did beat him.
But Mazda Dover's,

1781
01:47:50.910 --> 01:47:55.500
Brandon Thatch.
Oh,
got yourself a mother fucking son.

1782
01:47:55.501 --> 01:47:57.450
How's that still come Joseph with the,

1783
01:47:57.900 --> 01:48:00.870
with the weight cutting now that he can't use an IV anymore.

1784
01:48:01.230 --> 01:48:03.870
Does that have an effect on him at all?
He's a big ass one.

1785
01:48:03.871 --> 01:48:08.400
Saturday and B also not that disciplined,
so,
so hopefully,

1786
01:48:08.580 --> 01:48:12.660
hopefully he's doing.
Yeah.
And so looking for the Kimora here,

1787
01:48:12.690 --> 01:48:13.830
just in his face

1788
01:48:15.410 --> 01:48:16.620
<v 4>driving me fucking nuts.</v>

1789
01:48:18.100 --> 01:48:22.680
<v 2>Well look,
it's going to have no,
Oh,
boss play Guido.
This,
it's true.</v>

1790
01:48:22.900 --> 01:48:26.830
Look at this shit
mission.
A corn hole.

1791
01:48:26.920 --> 01:48:29.450
That's what we saw in the video.
He's just going to pass.

1792
01:48:29.630 --> 01:48:31.890
She gonna push light down and pass.
Do you think so?
Yup.

1793
01:48:32.500 --> 01:48:37.430
Not a Benson's good at this.
He's not Benson and keep that left leg and play

1794
01:48:39.550 --> 01:48:43.640
all case pass.
No written that.
Well,
no.
I had to let go.

1795
01:48:43.950 --> 01:48:47.660
He had all that goes on that left leg.
Yeah,
but he got lazy with it.
Yeah,
he did.

1796
01:48:47.690 --> 01:48:52.660
He forgot about it and never got hit once though.
It's true.
Yeah.

1797
01:48:52.670 --> 01:48:55.930
He didn't control his posture the entire time.
That's where it's like,
oh,
oh wow.

1798
01:48:59.990 --> 01:49:00.170
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

1799
01:49:00.170 --> 01:49:05.000
<v 2>This would be a good time to plug Ebi.
Oh Shit.
Sunday,
Sunday,</v>

1800
01:49:05.001 --> 01:49:10.001
December 13th I five seven top two biggest release the countdown show.

1801
01:49:10.940 --> 01:49:15.640
Just go to youtube.
Ebi.
Five countdown shows dope too.
Did you watch it?
Yeah,

1802
01:49:15.650 --> 01:49:19.640
when you sent me the link that way.
Cool.
Cool man.
Yeah.
Good man.
Googley movie.

1803
01:49:19.650 --> 01:49:23.320
Watch the check side.
Awesome.
That's great.
Yeah man.
I'm Paul.
Half Hour.
Oh,

1804
01:49:23.321 --> 01:49:25.570
hobbies story.
How did he,

1805
01:49:25.690 --> 01:49:29.210
how he took it in last minute but now he's at 55 different story.

1806
01:49:29.690 --> 01:49:34.340
Different story.
Eddie Cummings going is that one 45 champion?

1807
01:49:34.460 --> 01:49:36.560
Now he's going up to 55 but no one is,

1808
01:49:36.650 --> 01:49:40.880
no one gives a shit cause he actually did one 70 and tapped out and Rico coco

1809
01:49:40.881 --> 01:49:41.714
and he tapped out.

1810
01:49:41.720 --> 01:49:45.050
The one of my guys move so well up and down and wait like that.

1811
01:49:45.590 --> 01:49:48.100
He's so good with heel hooks,
man that

1812
01:49:48.100 --> 01:49:48.730
<v 0>he could,</v>

1813
01:49:48.730 --> 01:49:53.380
he could do major damage at 1701505145 doesn't,

1814
01:49:53.390 --> 01:49:56.920
isn't hard for it must be hard for him to make one 45 though he doesn't look

1815
01:49:56.921 --> 01:49:58.660
like a 445 pound guy.

1816
01:49:59.320 --> 01:50:04.320
Cummins probably walks around one 70 65 once,

1817
01:50:05.830 --> 01:50:10.180
but he did.
He did same day.
Weigh in one 45 Ebi for that's impressive.

1818
01:50:10.181 --> 01:50:15.040
And that's on youtube to all one,
two,
three and four are all free on youtube.

1819
01:50:15.120 --> 01:50:16.960
Uh,
Ebi five's going to be on paper,

1820
01:50:16.990 --> 01:50:21.730
feels butoh videos.com/ebi fun,
powerful,

1821
01:50:22.060 --> 01:50:26.020
Ai Greatest.
And then without a doubt the greatest format ever for grappling.

1822
01:50:26.410 --> 01:50:29.920
It's hundred person comparable and nailed down.

1823
01:50:29.950 --> 01:50:34.810
It's so perfect because it's very exciting up until the final part cause

1824
01:50:34.811 --> 01:50:36.490
everybody's worried about the final part.

1825
01:50:36.491 --> 01:50:41.140
But you solve the stalemate part and put them in bad positions and have them

1826
01:50:41.141 --> 01:50:41.974
alternate.

1827
01:50:42.040 --> 01:50:46.860
Alternate between having the back mount with an over under and having spiderweb.

1828
01:50:47.230 --> 01:50:48.070
It's beautiful.

1829
01:50:48.130 --> 01:50:51.400
It's a best they can actually get so excited to actually get the choice.
Yeah,

1830
01:50:51.870 --> 01:50:54.430
dude,
I might have a heart attack if I drink another one,
but I'm going to do,

1831
01:50:54.460 --> 01:50:57.850
you're going to be fun.
And then we got Denny coming back to defend his title.

1832
01:50:57.940 --> 01:51:00.640
So per call pose and then Nathan,

1833
01:51:00.880 --> 01:51:04.600
Nathan Orchard at one 55 that's a different animal because it's hard for him to

1834
01:51:04.601 --> 01:51:08.910
make 55,
he's going to be the tallest,
longest uh man and with,

1835
01:51:09.010 --> 01:51:10.510
with his dead orchards and his leg,

1836
01:51:10.520 --> 01:51:15.520
but he is more effective on a Ya Ya edcc gold medal is honey.

1837
01:51:16.601 --> 01:51:19.250
I asked Connie.
It's going to be Sarah.

1838
01:51:19.251 --> 01:51:24.150
I want to get a fucking shirt from him cause he's got team constrictor and I was

1839
01:51:24.151 --> 01:51:25.390
taught that was dope as shit.

1840
01:51:25.391 --> 01:51:28.180
I was wanting to ask him when they were going into the octagon I got,

1841
01:51:28.300 --> 01:51:31.100
but it was like he was fought on the undercard so I never got a chance to like

1842
01:51:31.120 --> 01:51:33.520
get back to like Yo man dude,
I wish she was one of them team kits.

1843
01:51:33.650 --> 01:51:35.500
Oh she's team honey constrict.

1844
01:51:37.760 --> 01:51:41.110
Usually that's your new shirt team.
Honey Dick team honeydew.

1845
01:51:42.450 --> 01:51:46.630
Connie,
this is honey dick boy than you.
You'd need a team,

1846
01:51:46.631 --> 01:51:50.770
honey Dick Shirt,
man.
Sure.
I get so many tweets during the UFC.
Oh,

1847
01:51:50.771 --> 01:51:53.660
this is UFC honey day.
That's all I get.
I'm like,

1848
01:51:54.080 --> 01:51:58.540
say that Hashtag honey Dick.
It's right.
This is the last round.

1849
01:51:59.410 --> 01:52:02.870
The final round.
Oh my hospital.

1850
01:52:03.390 --> 01:52:06.920
Serious grenache grappling.
Yeah.

1851
01:52:06.930 --> 01:52:09.880
So the Darren Cruickshank fight like as soon as you started grappling with

1852
01:52:09.881 --> 01:52:13.990
Crookshanks just shut all that down.
Shut him down.
Christian.
He's fighting soon.

1853
01:52:13.991 --> 01:52:18.490
Right?
The Detroit superstar.
I heard he did some polling for PE.
Did he?

1854
01:52:19.240 --> 01:52:21.930
Was that that you might have to look that up Jamie.
I'm,
I don't want to shit.

1855
01:52:21.940 --> 01:52:26.490
Look at them almost.
He's trapped.
He's caught.

1856
01:52:27.050 --> 01:52:30.610
He's caught take that keeps spinning.

1857
01:52:33.980 --> 01:52:38.080
Spins out.
He got it.
Wow.
Very good defense.

1858
01:52:38.950 --> 01:52:42.710
That is not good.
Get to it.

1859
01:52:42.910 --> 01:52:46.580
Oh Shit.
He keeps going to it.

1860
01:52:48.040 --> 01:52:50.510
Ben's confidence in.
Okay.
Like so that,

1861
01:52:50.540 --> 01:52:53.570
that's a really close situation.
Right.

1862
01:52:53.720 --> 01:52:57.780
Then ask this core for something that sounds good to me.
Grappling.

1863
01:52:57.790 --> 01:53:01.490
I mean that's serious danger,
right?
That's like a knockdown.
Yes.

1864
01:53:01.700 --> 01:53:05.600
I mean just because he doesn't get stunned and like he doesn't get brain damage

1865
01:53:05.601 --> 01:53:08.620
from that.
That it shouldn't.
It shouldn't factory like that was it.

1866
01:53:08.621 --> 01:53:11.980
That's as closest.
Then they'll fight is getting knocked down.
Very.
Wasn't that,

1867
01:53:11.981 --> 01:53:14.360
maybe it wasn't that close,
but that's a little different.

1868
01:53:14.361 --> 01:53:16.940
Like if you do an arm bar and he'd get out of the arm bar,

1869
01:53:16.941 --> 01:53:18.930
but they did hyper extended,
break it or pop,

1870
01:53:19.240 --> 01:53:22.970
you're still damaged and I'll tell you,
get out of it.
You're still good.

1871
01:53:22.971 --> 01:53:27.500
After you got his back and he took them down past his guard dominated grappling

1872
01:53:27.501 --> 01:53:29.120
and then,
and then almost choked him.
Yes,

1873
01:53:29.360 --> 01:53:32.270
ten eight but like from this kind of position,
whether it gets,

1874
01:53:32.420 --> 01:53:34.740
and then he throws a guillotine,
but then they're still cutting dude,

1875
01:53:34.741 --> 01:53:37.550
grandmas and [inaudible] Ben.
Ben was in trouble.

1876
01:53:37.551 --> 01:53:40.770
He's not going to go through all that if it's not tight,
but he kept,
that's got,

1877
01:53:40.960 --> 01:53:44.690
it's got to count for something.
Oh,
kicked to the bottom and taking down son.

1878
01:53:45.020 --> 01:53:48.570
Holy Shit.
This takes out of his take down defense on point.

1879
01:53:49.070 --> 01:53:52.190
Word flying.
Fuck man.

1880
01:53:52.580 --> 01:53:56.330
Really Ben for his team.
I'll ask to,
here's some cheeks on him.

1881
01:53:56.810 --> 01:54:00.040
He's got some thick ass thighs,
like an NFL running back.
Dude,

1882
01:54:00.080 --> 01:54:03.890
he had some of the best ground and pound where he would stand in the guard and

1883
01:54:03.891 --> 01:54:08.060
just drop bombs and state almost in a horse horse stance.

1884
01:54:09.280 --> 01:54:13.380
I remember Wec.
He's rolled the tiled.
Yeah.
Oh,

1885
01:54:13.381 --> 01:54:17.600
lost the position.
Oh,
score.
This fucking fight.

1886
01:54:19.060 --> 01:54:22.880
I should've kept that tired,
dad.
Yeah,

1887
01:54:22.881 --> 01:54:26.420
he's getting tired and pence thriving.
They're so slippery.

1888
01:54:27.370 --> 01:54:29.120
It's crazy.
All that grace

1889
01:54:31.280 --> 01:54:32.900
grabbing the fuck out of him right now.

1890
01:54:33.460 --> 01:54:37.760
What would that crux shake stuff at your own risk?
Why?
I'm right,
right.

1891
01:54:39.260 --> 01:54:43.320
Unconfirmed rumor in 2008 they don't call them Detroit soup.

1892
01:54:44.340 --> 01:54:45.770
This some shit.
That's what I heard.

1893
01:54:45.771 --> 01:54:50.330
Is it the regular kind and it said something about solo and some other name.

1894
01:54:50.331 --> 01:54:54.560
I didn't want low like Jackson Solo jacking and there's nothing wrong that a

1895
01:54:54.561 --> 01:54:59.520
little jacked for pillar man in the future.
There's going to be Photoshop,

1896
01:54:59.521 --> 01:55:03.570
so realistic and CGI,
so realistic on everybody's computer.
We're all doing it.

1897
01:55:04.540 --> 01:55:08.490
Everyone be liking it or not.
There's going to be videos.
You get that stuff.
Oh,

1898
01:55:08.810 --> 01:55:11.950
well there's been means Amiga sucking Dick left and right,

1899
01:55:11.960 --> 01:55:13.220
but that's his pictures.

1900
01:55:13.370 --> 01:55:16.610
They're going to be able to do that shit with video and no time.
You know,

1901
01:55:16.611 --> 01:55:18.560
like any video you watched today,

1902
01:55:18.740 --> 01:55:23.210
highly suspect of a news event,
a monster attack,

1903
01:55:23.310 --> 01:55:25.940
bigfoot in the woods,
they can make anything getting started.

1904
01:55:25.970 --> 01:55:29.570
They can make anything happen now and in the future,

1905
01:55:29.571 --> 01:55:31.190
like you're going to,

1906
01:55:31.310 --> 01:55:34.940
you're going to be able to watch every celebrity you've ever wanted to watch.

1907
01:55:34.941 --> 01:55:38.740
Fuck,
I'm looking forward to that.
Jennifer Lawrence.
Dude,
I'm fucking in.

1908
01:55:38.741 --> 01:55:43.741
Marilyn Monroe sold Traci lords and all of them together in a room.

1909
01:55:44.710 --> 01:55:47.160
I'm man going after Chris Farley gonna blow.
Yeah,

1910
01:55:47.161 --> 01:55:51.380
he's getting fucking David's Bait.
Saki,
Chris Farley's dig all.

1911
01:55:51.400 --> 01:55:54.060
That's all.
That's real.
That's real.

1912
01:55:55.440 --> 01:55:58.840
Then you could get the holograms right where it's like a three d right in front

1913
01:55:58.841 --> 01:56:01.830
of the Washer,
right in front of you.
You build it and it'll be like,

1914
01:56:01.960 --> 01:56:03.930
it'll be so good.
The holograms be so good.

1915
01:56:03.931 --> 01:56:08.130
You want to able a see through them to look like real three dimensional objects

1916
01:56:08.131 --> 01:56:09.870
in front of you can't wait for this.
Yeah,

1917
01:56:10.050 --> 01:56:11.970
you're just going to be shooting loads in the loads.

1918
01:56:11.971 --> 01:56:15.390
We'll go through them will disappear.
You guys won't really about there.

1919
01:56:15.610 --> 01:56:19.710
It's going to,
all the loads are going to be there.
You just have your own loads.

1920
01:56:20.010 --> 01:56:23.370
Digital loads.
Like if you were jerking off,
it's like a litter box,

1921
01:56:23.440 --> 01:56:26.850
a cat litter box.
You just jerk and knew it.
It's going to be crazy.

1922
01:56:27.030 --> 01:56:31.980
Well we're going to see in the next 20 years as far as like the ability to

1923
01:56:32.340 --> 01:56:36.180
artificially manipulate images and make thing like that magic leap.

1924
01:56:36.181 --> 01:56:38.550
You ever seen that magic leap technology they're working on?

1925
01:56:38.790 --> 01:56:41.760
They don't know how they're doing it like cause they haven't revealed it yet,

1926
01:56:41.990 --> 01:56:45.900
but they show like this uh,
elephant dancing and this person's hand.

1927
01:56:46.140 --> 01:56:49.680
They show this little girl like sitting on a bed and a four inch ballerinas

1928
01:56:49.681 --> 01:56:53.550
dancing in front of her on the bed and it looks real and fun.

1929
01:56:53.890 --> 01:56:57.870
It's insane.
Holding something.
I don't know.
I don't know how it works that it.

1930
01:56:57.871 --> 01:57:00.450
See the thing is in the images that they show,

1931
01:57:00.610 --> 01:57:02.430
they haven't fully revealed it yet,

1932
01:57:02.431 --> 01:57:04.360
but in the images that they show people doing it,

1933
01:57:04.390 --> 01:57:07.410
the people don't have any goggles on.
Theirs is like,

1934
01:57:07.411 --> 01:57:09.510
it's not like there's some technology that they have.

1935
01:57:09.690 --> 01:57:13.170
We see it through like ski goggles,
like look at this,
look at this.

1936
01:57:14.680 --> 01:57:18.960
This is like under a dex shot directly through magic leap technology.

1937
01:57:19.350 --> 01:57:20.490
So like they're,
they,

1938
01:57:20.520 --> 01:57:25.170
they have these holograms that they can project from the air like that.

1939
01:57:25.200 --> 01:57:27.960
Like look at that.
I want that some Avatar shit right now.

1940
01:57:27.990 --> 01:57:30.810
Like you're sitting there and eating and above you.

1941
01:57:30.810 --> 01:57:35.490
Is the solar system spinning around?
Well,
the,
the ones that they showed,

1942
01:57:35.491 --> 01:57:38.790
they had one of them where it was a whale on the beach.
It was crazy.

1943
01:57:39.090 --> 01:57:41.500
Did you see in Robin Williams a will,

1944
01:57:41.860 --> 01:57:46.170
he has a contract where they can't use any of his name or likeness for future

1945
01:57:46.171 --> 01:57:50.400
holograms or any technology like this.
How smart is that?
He's like,

1946
01:57:50.401 --> 01:57:53.610
I don't be recreated when technology can do that kind of stuff.

1947
01:57:53.640 --> 01:57:55.740
He doesn't want to be like two pocket Coachella.
Yeah.

1948
01:57:55.741 --> 01:57:58.740
He doesn't want any of that.
I'm pretty smart to think of that shit.

1949
01:57:58.800 --> 01:58:03.300
They should have like a real time where the earth is in relation to the other

1950
01:58:03.301 --> 01:58:04.740
planets,
like real time.

1951
01:58:04.920 --> 01:58:07.800
Pretty smart that they pretend that you're looking at the planets because they

1952
01:58:07.801 --> 01:58:12.270
put it right over that girls titties.
Yeah.
I am a,

1953
01:58:12.271 --> 01:58:14.220
I'm looking at the solar system.
Meanwhile,

1954
01:58:15.770 --> 01:58:20.370
ferocious mound road says,
aw,
so lovely.

1955
01:58:21.090 --> 01:58:25.350
Is there some late uh,
ted type show with the latest technology and jerking off?

1956
01:58:25.530 --> 01:58:29.610
I wouldn't.
You want to watch that happen ted?
Who's winning?

1957
01:58:30.330 --> 01:58:35.310
Oh Shit.
Shit could've won.
It could've gone either way.

1958
01:58:35.460 --> 01:58:39.510
I can't.
Yeah.
Wow.
I didn't watch it close enough.
But split decision sounds right.

1959
01:58:40.350 --> 01:58:42.010
Yeah.
Oh,
there's his wife and

1960
01:58:42.010 --> 01:58:45.310
<v 2>new baby man.
The cardio,
he doesn't want it.</v>

1961
01:58:46.090 --> 01:58:49.490
It went right to why did they go right to Mosbey doll?

1962
01:58:52.860 --> 01:58:53.730
Why would they do that?

1963
01:58:57.620 --> 01:58:59.010
It's a terrible,
hold on.

1964
01:59:02.540 --> 01:59:05.410
<v 4>Maybe we can be in the biggest stage in the world.</v>

1965
01:59:09.290 --> 01:59:10.370
It's the nature of the beast.

1966
01:59:11.720 --> 01:59:16.720
<v 2>If there was a change there now he seems like he's accepted into defeat.</v>

1967
01:59:17.600 --> 01:59:18.433
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1968
01:59:19.460 --> 01:59:22.760
<v 2>It's weird.
They went right to him though.
Never seen it before.
First time ever</v>

1969
01:59:23.240 --> 01:59:24.010
<v 4>probably notice that</v>

1970
01:59:24.010 --> 01:59:24.940
<v 2>someone fucked up</v>

1971
01:59:27.340 --> 01:59:29.950
100% you can't go to him first talk to the winter.

1972
01:59:30.040 --> 01:59:33.450
It does seem weird or maybe they want to get

1973
01:59:35.430 --> 01:59:36.440
any floor and in the,

1974
01:59:36.441 --> 01:59:39.520
we didn't listen to the commentary unless he was saying in the commentary that

1975
01:59:39.521 --> 01:59:40.710
he thought that Mosfet all

1976
01:59:42.810 --> 01:59:44.670
just doesn't sense

1977
01:59:47.860 --> 01:59:48.693
his fight against,

1978
01:59:55.070 --> 01:59:56.060
damn,
he's straight up.

1979
02:00:02.870 --> 02:00:07.000
Can we get some Denver talking to Benson and Korean like he doesn't understand

1980
02:00:07.001 --> 02:00:10.240
English?
Ben's Mom's Korean.
I know.

1981
02:00:12.170 --> 02:00:16.850
Can I get an amen?
Amen.
Can I get an amen?
Amen.

1982
02:00:16.851 --> 02:00:17.684
Amen.

1983
02:00:23.240 --> 02:00:27.380
It was arms of tremendous,
huge.
It looks great.

1984
02:00:29.540 --> 02:00:31.880
How's the interpreter gonna actually

1985
02:00:34.790 --> 02:00:38.170
keep this bus rolling.
Bus.

1986
02:00:39.120 --> 02:00:43.610
Whoa.
Bounce

1987
02:00:46.250 --> 02:00:50.420
already your best performance,
especially in regards to your striking man.

1988
02:00:50.421 --> 02:00:53.990
This was the sharpest I've ever seen you up.
Who?
I disagree,

1989
02:00:55.030 --> 02:00:59.890
but we weren't really paying attention that much.
I saw Kenny was on the stick.

1990
02:01:00.830 --> 02:01:05.550
Fondling is luscious beard.
Let me pontificate,
right?

1991
02:01:05.770 --> 02:01:08.540
What did all what's then we'll see.
What he does is go,

1992
02:01:09.240 --> 02:01:12.810
how call it though Jorge George,
and also stepping up and giving me this fight.

1993
02:01:13.130 --> 02:01:17.860
A bad,
it's bad buck son of a gun.

1994
02:01:17.861 --> 02:01:20.870
Is that what he said?
But he was trying so hard not to cuss their

1995
02:01:23.670 --> 02:01:27.990
ass son of a gun,
a bad,
but son of a gun.
Bad bottom.

1996
02:01:28.040 --> 02:01:32.270
So a bad booty.
Bandit,
bad booty band.

1997
02:01:33.090 --> 02:01:34.900
People might boom,
boom.

1998
02:01:35.220 --> 02:01:38.430
Dick bandits texted to me,

1999
02:01:38.431 --> 02:01:42.920
tweet it to more often than not,
when I connect myself to you guys in some way,

2000
02:01:43.970 --> 02:01:47.980
Dick bandits.
What does that mean?
It's just a song that we sing on.

2001
02:01:48.710 --> 02:01:51.600
Sing it for me.
How's it go?
It goes big.
Dig bandits.

2002
02:01:54.110 --> 02:01:56.990
Bandits.
Waste the robber bags and your Dick.

2003
02:01:57.500 --> 02:01:59.220
I don't understand Alban dudes

2004
02:02:03.310 --> 02:02:05.840
do it.
These live shows,
they asked us to sing it.

2005
02:02:05.841 --> 02:02:09.050
Me and Brian are starting this big date bandits.

2006
02:02:09.080 --> 02:02:13.410
This live shows was to be so silly,
so fun,
so fun.
A lot of them.
You didn't.

2007
02:02:13.411 --> 02:02:17.480
You do one Wednesday night,
Wednesday night.
They're all sold out,
man.

2008
02:02:17.481 --> 02:02:21.170
Then amazing.
The West Coast tour,
they're all selling great.

2009
02:02:21.380 --> 02:02:22.670
Like I was talking to before.

2010
02:02:22.671 --> 02:02:26.300
I'm just worried about the Seattle and Portland cause they're huge theaters for

2011
02:02:26.301 --> 02:02:30.200
us.
You know what?
800 900 seats.
That's big.
Yeah.
Jesus Christ.

2012
02:02:30.370 --> 02:02:33.920
And what about a Denver?
Have you done Denver?
No,
we're doing a mid uh,

2013
02:02:33.950 --> 02:02:37.280
mid west run and an east coast run later into you got to do east coast,

2014
02:02:37.970 --> 02:02:41.380
east coast.
We're going New York,
Boston,
I mean all over.

2015
02:02:41.400 --> 02:02:45.530
What are you guys doing for Boston?
Which I'm not sure.
Just do the Wilbur.
Really?

2016
02:02:45.610 --> 02:02:49.320
Yeah.
People get crazy.
Go 1200 seats for sure.
Come with it.

2017
02:02:50.540 --> 02:02:54.890
I'm ready.
I'm ready.
April 1st and second.
Are you there?

2018
02:02:54.950 --> 02:02:57.260
I'm already booked tickets.

2019
02:02:58.670 --> 02:03:02.360
I'm doing shit way in advance now.
That's all the know what the UFC,

2020
02:03:02.361 --> 02:03:04.870
the problem is like UFC doesn't announce their,

2021
02:03:05.150 --> 02:03:09.140
their schedule like as far in advance as usually do book,

2022
02:03:09.141 --> 02:03:10.670
like theaters and stuff like that.

2023
02:03:10.840 --> 02:03:12.950
So like a lot of times like wall come into a place,

2024
02:03:12.951 --> 02:03:15.620
like they'll announce it like a couple months out and I go,

2025
02:03:15.621 --> 02:03:18.680
let me see if I could find a place where I to work.
It's too late.
Yeah.

2026
02:03:18.681 --> 02:03:20.330
Everything.
Now.
Look,
if I'm lucky,

2027
02:03:20.331 --> 02:03:22.760
I can get the comedy club on like a Friday night,

2028
02:03:23.030 --> 02:03:26.000
but a lot of times I can't even do that.
I have seen in the late shit.

2029
02:03:26.900 --> 02:03:31.340
Fuck this noise.
I like comedy clubs though.
I bet.
I'm just so you come into,

2030
02:03:31.341 --> 02:03:35.570
especially with the UFC is in town.
Everyone see your shit?
Yeah.

2031
02:03:36.320 --> 02:03:40.780
This is what I want to see this.
Fuck God damn.
I hope this actually happens.

2032
02:03:40.860 --> 02:03:43.110
It's happening.
God got it happened.

2033
02:03:47.750 --> 02:03:51.990
Aldo and motherfucking McGregor.
Dude,
we got to have the fight before when Greg,

2034
02:03:51.991 --> 02:03:55.950
it puts more tattoos on to that.
That tiger one.
He's all right,
man.

2035
02:03:55.951 --> 02:03:59.340
He's got to tell him he covered up the slow down.
ABS.
Take it easy.

2036
02:03:59.400 --> 02:04:01.920
Why would you cover your abs up?
Very well known.
He has nice abs,

2037
02:04:02.040 --> 02:04:05.390
but why would you do that?
The Tattoo so good.
It looks three d.

2038
02:04:05.610 --> 02:04:10.380
It looked like a tattoo.
I get in my belly.
It's too much.
That's too much.

2039
02:04:10.790 --> 02:04:13.790
And why?
Why a tiger on the stomach?
It's just loves tigers.

2040
02:04:14.070 --> 02:04:16.800
It just allows you to do it.
I don't know,
man.

2041
02:04:16.830 --> 02:04:20.860
Maybe it's like some spirit allocates this boom.
You're not showing the,

2042
02:04:20.870 --> 02:04:23.370
the short haired roads pick.
They don't have,

2043
02:04:23.400 --> 02:04:28.080
they didn't update the trend haired vanzant.
What's it is trimmed there.

2044
02:04:28.081 --> 02:04:30.600
It's perfect.
That's exactly how much you cut off.
I'm not kidding.

2045
02:04:30.750 --> 02:04:33.710
I'm not mad at it.
Good for her.
You go girl.
Oh,
she would look dot.

2046
02:04:33.770 --> 02:04:36.930
With a shaved head.
Please.
They'll grow.
Would look high with a crew cut.

2047
02:04:36.940 --> 02:04:40.170
She's hot as fuck.
They're both one's fun.
I'm on board.
Yeah.

2048
02:04:40.650 --> 02:04:44.100
I dated a girl who was completely shaven bald when I first moved out to

2049
02:04:44.101 --> 02:04:47.400
California.
It was by choice and yeah,
she's hot.

2050
02:04:47.460 --> 02:04:50.670
She would wear weird wigs and shit.
She was cool.
She was hot.

2051
02:04:51.060 --> 02:04:54.180
She must've been on heroin or she was just crazy.
She was from Norway.

2052
02:04:54.870 --> 02:04:57.210
She was a wild cat.
Oh Jesus.

2053
02:04:57.211 --> 02:04:59.620
Louise's you don't shave your head just for the Lord.

2054
02:05:00.730 --> 02:05:05.070
That's like some cleansing heroin recovery shit.
She's,
she was smart as fuck too.

2055
02:05:05.071 --> 02:05:09.960
Very interesting person.
I bet she was a freaking machine.
Listen,

2056
02:05:09.961 --> 02:05:12.750
I'm not a kiss and tell type of guy,
but um,

2057
02:05:13.060 --> 02:05:16.740
but it was weird with doggystyle the back of the head like shaved.

2058
02:05:16.740 --> 02:05:20.280
It was like odd.
Like at least it was,
we were looking at each other.

2059
02:05:20.460 --> 02:05:21.750
I could see like you're pretty,

2060
02:05:21.990 --> 02:05:24.320
you're a girl even though you don't have any here.

2061
02:05:24.321 --> 02:05:27.090
Not been there with muscular chicks.

2062
02:05:27.091 --> 02:05:30.030
Am I decos Doggie stoma did not like that.

2063
02:05:30.090 --> 02:05:34.230
I was in my twenties I was till it was,
it was too young to handle weirdness.

2064
02:05:34.290 --> 02:05:34.741
I agree.

2065
02:05:34.741 --> 02:05:39.480
Now I was 26 you can't handle the weirdness of 26 that'll fuck your whole game

2066
02:05:39.481 --> 02:05:43.830
up then.
You're just too weak.
You're not ready for it.
Yeah,
you're not ready.

2067
02:05:43.890 --> 02:05:46.830
Any one thing could kill your boner and he need to experience that.

2068
02:05:46.831 --> 02:05:50.970
You went to fucking spiral of panic.
It was a good ass fight,
man.

2069
02:05:51.010 --> 02:05:55.200
That was really good fight.
Good card man overall for whatever.

2070
02:05:55.201 --> 02:05:56.670
We paid attention to shit,
man.

2071
02:05:56.671 --> 02:06:01.671
For together five o'clock in the morning some days just having imagine that

2072
02:06:02.130 --> 02:06:06.120
Flintstones on or some shit doesn't watch Fox News and talk with the girls.

2073
02:06:06.120 --> 02:06:09.840
Deliver the news bunch of chicks with skirts on talking about them.

2074
02:06:09.841 --> 02:06:14.110
CNN brings the heat though with check today.
Well I want to do it in the morning.

2075
02:06:14.340 --> 02:06:16.350
I don't really think so.
It's just the way the operate.

2076
02:06:16.370 --> 02:06:19.590
Well if they had to probably compete with Fox because Fox is bringing in them,

2077
02:06:19.591 --> 02:06:22.230
she demos those blonde white

2078
02:06:23.790 --> 02:06:28.040
and tell it and Telemundo,
if you watch news on Telemundo,

2079
02:06:28.820 --> 02:06:32.490
I can't handle it to pay attention to the news.

2080
02:06:32.560 --> 02:06:36.810
All I'm seating and Rita's given out the news that per ruby red lipstick final

2081
02:06:36.840 --> 02:06:41.280
round with national scam callers.
I wish I got that channel.

2082
02:06:41.281 --> 02:06:44.130
Is it Jack?
My Shit wrong.

2083
02:06:44.430 --> 02:06:46.920
Do they have that on youtube that I'm the Spanish ladies doing the weather.

2084
02:06:46.921 --> 02:06:47.754
Do they have them on Youtube?

2085
02:06:48.180 --> 02:06:51.750
Have you seen that Spanish girl on Telemundo doing the weather Spec?

2086
02:06:52.710 --> 02:06:57.600
Fuck her re Dickus she's an angel

The sexy Yama.
No,

Yeah,

2088
02:07:04.100 --> 02:07:08.460
I get it.
But she's a legit Latin Angel Man.
Yes.

2089
02:07:08.910 --> 02:07:12.360
She liked crossed over cause she was like on TMZ and shit.
She's so fine.

2090
02:07:12.480 --> 02:07:16.890
Like there she is.
Oh look at that ass son.
Oh my goodness.

2091
02:07:16.920 --> 02:07:20.240
Is that real?
Yeah,
it's a weird ass major.

2092
02:07:21.660 --> 02:07:25.470
Bravo from Mexico.
It's a weird ass weird and that it makes my Dick Dance.

2093
02:07:25.770 --> 02:07:29.580
We're definitely filling up with blood,
but that's what you mean by weird.

2094
02:07:29.581 --> 02:07:33.300
Look at her ass in the right hands.
The last frame.
I'm like God,

2095
02:07:33.301 --> 02:07:36.070
it's like it's insane.
I don't know at

2096
02:07:36.070 --> 02:07:39.150
<v 0>first of all it's really rude that she sticks it out like that.
It's,</v>

2097
02:07:39.230 --> 02:07:42.190
we understand.
It's kind of weird at the right cheek is perfect.
Eddie.

2098
02:07:42.200 --> 02:07:45.640
Is that funny that a girl is totally allowed sticker ass cheeks out like that?

2099
02:07:45.790 --> 02:07:48.400
Like if a guy like walks around like this,

2100
02:07:48.610 --> 02:07:51.250
like pop makes chest out and throws his arms

2101
02:07:51.290 --> 02:07:52.630
<v 2>back.
The guy's a loser</v>

2102
02:07:56.700 --> 02:08:00.890
like she can,
if she stands like that for long,
she's going to blow it disk.

2103
02:08:02.700 --> 02:08:06.580
That's so dangerous.
You can't carry anything with you.

2104
02:08:06.650 --> 02:08:10.670
So she tried to carry like a lunchbox.
She might fuck it.

2105
02:08:10.671 --> 02:08:12.740
You have a herniated disc due.
She's my girl.

2106
02:08:12.741 --> 02:08:17.720
She's walking around like that all the time.
Carrier.

2115
02:08:52.030 --> 02:08:56.680
Was that a guy talking about her?
Yeah,

2116
02:08:58.450 --> 02:09:01.900
Y'All watch out for that.
Live on TV.
Good Lord.

2117

It makes our weather girls look like fucking shit.

2118
02:09:04.990 --> 02:09:08.470
Fucking pro tip to the guy doing the video.
We don't need to see you.

2119
02:09:08.560 --> 02:09:13.180
We can hear you just voice over.
I don't need this.
This is not necessary,
sir.

2120
02:09:13.181 --> 02:09:16.630
This is interrupting with the girl's booty.
Yeah,

2121
02:09:16.631 --> 02:09:19.600
we don't want to see your Scott Hass.

2126
02:09:37.331 --> 02:09:41.950
the weather.
A good girl like her.
So important.
It is very important.

2127
02:09:42.170 --> 02:09:45.730
I've met their ratings are through the roof.
Jesus.
Meanwhile,

2128
02:09:45.731 --> 02:09:49.510
in America we get that fucking guy.
The black guy lost all the weight.

2129
02:09:54.560 --> 02:09:59.210
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

2130
02:10:03.730 --> 02:10:04.900

2131
02:10:07.780 --> 02:10:11.170
Oh my God.
It's so stupid.
Look at her.

2132
02:10:11.720 --> 02:10:13.920
Oh my God.

2133
02:10:13.950 --> 02:10:18.350

It's just read.
That's crazy.</v>

2134
02:10:18.380 --> 02:10:21.180
You find the hotter weather girl and come talk to me.
Yeah.
I don't think,
well,

2135
02:10:21.410 --> 02:10:25.100
girls don't get hotter.
There's like a level of hot.
They just get different.

2136
02:10:25.130 --> 02:10:28.610
I agree.
No,
they don't have great,
it's like a nice,
yeah,
just said,

2137
02:10:28.620 --> 02:10:31.610
it gets to a certain point where like,
okay,
this is just hot.

2138
02:10:31.670 --> 02:10:36.520
She's just how good he is.
Just denial.
She's a 10 looks that goes there,

2139
02:10:36.560 --> 02:10:40.220
but there are,
that's one of the most hilarious things about guys online.

2140
02:10:41.280 --> 02:10:43.100
Elbows are way to point a bro.

2141
02:10:43.610 --> 02:10:46.760
That's the standard one that people always walk off.
But there's,

2142
02:10:46.761 --> 02:10:51.761
there's so many guys that little talk shit about like unbelievably smoking hot

2143
02:10:52.251 --> 02:10:56.180
chicks.
They talk mad shit online.
She ain't nothing to me,
bro.

2144
02:10:56.650 --> 02:10:59.720
Maybe a six.
Maybe it's six.
It's six broke

2145
02:11:02.240 --> 02:11:05.750
bro out real turds.
Shut up.
Shut up.
Shut up

2146
02:11:07.310 --> 02:11:07.701
dude.

2147
02:11:07.701 --> 02:11:12.701
The Internet and social media is fucking their HSAs are the most,

2148
02:11:13.690 --> 02:11:17.210
like Rhonda came,
gone social media right now.
She'd stay off for her.

2149
02:11:17.570 --> 02:11:21.760
She needs a post.
What if she laughs?
What if she's having fun with it?
Oh,
hey,

2150
02:11:22.350 --> 02:11:27.230
look at me.
She's not 100% I'd be devastated.
That's horrible shit man.

2151
02:11:27.440 --> 02:11:30.410
You know,
that's a,
that's a kind of Keio too that you got to go,
man,

2152
02:11:30.880 --> 02:11:35.810
we hopefully she recovers 100% and she's back and everything's great,

2153
02:11:35.840 --> 02:11:40.190
but you don't have to recover 100% from a Kale like that.

2154
02:11:40.400 --> 02:11:44.810
Like head kick.
That's a,
that's a bad knockout.
But what about,

2155
02:11:45.760 --> 02:11:48.470
what about you?
You know,
obviously health issues.
What about your confidence?

2156
02:11:49.540 --> 02:11:52.310
Invincible.
You think Europe,
the bathroom.
I forgot to plan.

2157
02:11:52.370 --> 02:11:56.210
Then all of a sudden it's like,
Nah,
you're just like the rest of us.
Yeah,

2158
02:11:56.280 --> 02:12:00.290
I mean that that certainly can be a factor,
but confidence.

2159
02:12:00.290 --> 02:12:05.290
I feel like maybe you could get that back through meditation or through hypnosis

2160
02:12:05.601 --> 02:12:09.050
or through something or through just hardworking determination maybe,

2161
02:12:09.051 --> 02:12:12.860
but the physical stuff,
like if it's bad,
it's bad.
I agree.

2162
02:12:12.970 --> 02:12:17.030
Look at Tj grant is a good example.
Tj Grant got one concussion.

2163
02:12:17.060 --> 02:12:20.790
He was in line to fight for the title.
He has never fought since and now he's,

2164
02:12:20.840 --> 02:12:21.950
we went back to work.

2165
02:12:21.980 --> 02:12:25.990
Is he done gun job like a mine in Canada?

2166
02:12:26.500 --> 02:12:30.770
Gog.
Tj Grant.
Remember Tj grant lit up gray.

2167
02:12:30.771 --> 02:12:34.820
Maynard looked fucking fantastical.
Surreal.
His elbows.
Devastating.
Ridiculous.

2168
02:12:34.840 --> 02:12:37.480
Misty technique.
Nasty technique.
Tough fucking guy.

2169
02:12:37.481 --> 02:12:39.470
He's working at fucking Hortons or some shit.

2170
02:12:40.320 --> 02:12:44.900
He's get those mining jobs like in Alberta.
They make good money.

2171
02:12:44.930 --> 02:12:47.750
Did he give him,
I mean he had a good chance to be a world champ.

2172
02:12:47.780 --> 02:12:48.940
Could have been a world champ.
I mean,

2173
02:12:48.960 --> 02:12:52.400
it might not have won the first time at the title,
but he had a,
he had real,

2174
02:12:52.520 --> 02:12:56.410
real legit worldclass Gill.
100% yeah.
And he could have made a good robot.

2175
02:12:56.420 --> 02:13:00.590
Chris Holdsworth same thing.
Concussion.
He's,
he's got,
he's got a problem.

2176
02:13:00.591 --> 02:13:04.070
He hasn't fought since Danny.
Danny have an ACL two or something like that.

2177
02:13:04.071 --> 02:13:07.910
So kind of surgery kind of surgery.
I remember Joseph Valtellina,

2178
02:13:07.911 --> 02:13:11.150
he glory champion,
how to relinquish his title,
concussions.

2179
02:13:11.580 --> 02:13:13.130
If Connor has a bad loss,

2180
02:13:13.131 --> 02:13:16.220
if he gets like chaos out and gets caught real bad head kick or something.

2181
02:13:16.790 --> 02:13:21.110
I mean damn.
Hey go one man.
I think like,
look at how,
first of all,

2182
02:13:21.320 --> 02:13:25.400
Holly homes all over the place now she's,
she's on every fucking new show.

2183
02:13:25.670 --> 02:13:28.460
She's over ESPN and all these different sports shows.

2184
02:13:28.820 --> 02:13:32.370
She easily could have a gigantic paper view in our next card.

2185
02:13:32.610 --> 02:13:37.020
Like people are excited about her and only if it gets Rhonda may be,

2186
02:13:37.110 --> 02:13:39.930
but if it's not Rhonda,
she might have half a million.

2187
02:13:40.110 --> 02:13:42.320
It's horrible if she has a good fight.

2188
02:13:42.680 --> 02:13:47.680
But the amount of positive like publicity she got out of that and the mount she

2189
02:13:48.840 --> 02:13:51.540
was everyone's at.
But people are gonna want to see her fight again.

2190
02:13:51.750 --> 02:13:55.730
And if they see her fight,
something like Cyborg may be.
Yeah,

2191
02:13:55.860 --> 02:13:59.820
if you are at one 40 if she says I'll step up to one 40 and she fight Cyborg at

2192
02:13:59.821 --> 02:14:04.440
one 40 or even,
I think she fought as high as one 50 when she was kickboxing.

2193
02:14:04.570 --> 02:14:08.040
I don't,
I don't think she'll,
you know,
I love Holly or barking.
She's great.

2194
02:14:08.041 --> 02:14:10.800
I don't think should ever be as big as stars.
Rhonda.
No Ma,

2195
02:14:10.860 --> 02:14:15.060
how many fights you might not be.
This had this perfect storm of personality,

2196
02:14:15.330 --> 02:14:20.190
hatred and destroying girls in 16 seconds where it was like this perfect storm

2197
02:14:20.220 --> 02:14:22.860
where she crossed over to the possibility of Rothrock,
man,

2198
02:14:22.861 --> 02:14:26.540
she's going to be like the greatest and being movie rock.
That's hilarious.

2199
02:14:30.390 --> 02:14:32.280
She was like a a forms champion.

2200
02:14:32.340 --> 02:14:36.870
Cynthia rothrock do remember her Anda well,
Kathy long actually,

2201
02:14:37.340 --> 02:14:42.010
she was a kickbox kickboxer Carano Holly Holm.
I Dunno.
I'm just fucked her.

2202
02:14:42.011 --> 02:14:45.330
I would be a crazy fight if Gina Carano came back.
That makes sense.
Let's,

2203
02:14:45.340 --> 02:14:48.400
let's play devil's advocate,
let's say,
and there's a good chance it's not even,

2204
02:14:48.420 --> 02:14:53.250
I'm not even hating,
but let's say Connor were to loose,
who's the UFC superstar?

2205
02:14:53.700 --> 02:14:58.080
Who's the judge?
I'll do if he beats him.
Oh yeah,
no,
no,
not in America.
Jon Jones.

2206
02:14:59.160 --> 02:15:03.660
Jon Jones be the next [inaudible] can't be a mega star,
but Anderson was,

2207
02:15:04.470 --> 02:15:08.220
I don't know,
man.
I'd make,
because he's smaller.
Is that what it is?
I think so.

2208
02:15:08.850 --> 02:15:11.280
That's the way America works.
If it's English is terrible,

2209
02:15:11.500 --> 02:15:16.380
he'll be on or not the level.
It could also level positions then for how long?

2210
02:15:16.610 --> 02:15:18.060
Middleweights been forever.

2211
02:15:18.061 --> 02:15:21.600
And then outdoors is kind of still the only and the new.

2212
02:15:21.630 --> 02:15:26.430
But if all Dover questions,
Mcgregor,
people will just make comparisons to Rhonda.

2213
02:15:26.700 --> 02:15:30.540
Like,
Oh,
you guys overrated.
Yes,
yes.
That's definitely will.
Hundred percent.

2214
02:15:30.541 --> 02:15:34.860
And I'm like,
oh,
UFC.
Just the hype train bubbles floating is the hype is real.

2215
02:15:34.920 --> 02:15:39.850
Like you look at his fights,
there's no hype I lost in 10 years.
She fucks.

2216
02:15:40.090 --> 02:15:44.730
It's real.
But,
but,
but both Conor and Aldo,
both of them,

2217
02:15:44.760 --> 02:15:48.780
that's real.
I mean you look at Conor destroying Mendez,

2218
02:15:49.230 --> 02:15:53.820
beating the fuck out of Seaver blast and [inaudible] out in the first round.

2219
02:15:53.970 --> 02:15:55.560
I mean it doesn't compare to what Joe's Ale,

2220
02:15:55.561 --> 02:16:00.390
no Brandao Kao but he's legitimately legitimately skilled.

2221
02:16:00.420 --> 02:16:02.880
100% one was like that's an exciting fight.

2222
02:16:03.020 --> 02:16:07.080
The the what the fuck is gonna Happen?
Factor is very high,
right?

2223
02:16:07.081 --> 02:16:09.750
You look at that fight,
it's like what the fuck is going to happen?
It's huge.

2224
02:16:09.751 --> 02:16:10.950
We could speculate all day,

2225
02:16:11.100 --> 02:16:14.280
but the best is what's going to happen after whoever wins.

2226
02:16:14.310 --> 02:16:16.200
You'll be able to go online and they'll be the,

2227
02:16:16.201 --> 02:16:21.030
I told you so dude's hundred percent lined up lined up.

2228
02:16:21.031 --> 02:16:25.920
So weird man gets on social media way to fucking go.

2229
02:16:25.921 --> 02:16:30.820
Joe Rogan,
Eddie Bravo and Ben let it,
I don't mind that,
that doesn't bother me.

2230
02:16:31.020 --> 02:16:33.400
[inaudible] is kind of crazy.

2231
02:16:33.401 --> 02:16:37.490
Is like the for Roche's meeting.

2232
02:16:37.590 --> 02:16:40.840
They're given Rhonda for real.
She asked for it though.

2233
02:16:40.960 --> 02:16:43.450
Like when like when you post that night before the fight,

2234
02:16:43.451 --> 02:16:47.900
like you fucking fake ass bitch.
Hey man,
relax.

2235
02:16:48.130 --> 02:16:51.520
So when you act like,
then you don't shake hands and you're an actual,
you know,

2236
02:16:51.521 --> 02:16:54.070
when you,
when you go after these girls who don't have a reason to,

2237
02:16:54.190 --> 02:16:56.140
then people are like,
you know what?
Now you're being a bully.

2238
02:16:56.230 --> 02:17:00.940
And so when you leave it at that level,
she was a good word.

2239
02:17:00.941 --> 02:17:04.630
Goons are legit word,
good word.
You know,
when I started using that word again,

2240
02:17:04.840 --> 02:17:06.050
Eddie Bravo,
uh,

2241
02:17:06.310 --> 02:17:11.310
his back before we knew that a north south choke was legit and Monson got

2242
02:17:11.651 --> 02:17:14.720
someone in north south choke and you said he googled them.

2243
02:17:14.900 --> 02:17:18.680
[inaudible]

2244
02:17:19.230 --> 02:17:22.930
has done it using that word every,
this was a long time ago.

2245
02:17:22.931 --> 02:17:25.480
Cause think about how long north south chokes had been legit.

2246
02:17:25.660 --> 02:17:28.330
But there was a while where we didn't know the north south choke was legit

2247
02:17:28.350 --> 02:17:32.060
months and made that shit and Monsi is such a tank and you just assumed that he

2248
02:17:32.061 --> 02:17:34.660
gooned up just trying to like,
come on man,

2249
02:17:34.661 --> 02:17:38.470
you're just squeezing on his head and plants.
Come on.
That's goon squad son.

2250
02:17:38.530 --> 02:17:41.170
Meanwhile you're really good at that.
That's my shit.
I love,

2251
02:17:41.171 --> 02:17:45.130
I've loved North South chose certain guys that love north south and I'll put

2252
02:17:45.131 --> 02:17:46.830
them on every car.
When was a beast?

2253
02:17:47.230 --> 02:17:51.040
Choke is like all the elements of the head and arm choke was always my favorite.

2254
02:17:51.041 --> 02:17:53.140
But you don't put pressure on your own neck.

2255
02:17:53.530 --> 02:17:55.210
Like you don't have as much pressure on your own neck.

2256
02:17:55.240 --> 02:18:00.210
It's like a cell is really good as you get to save it all fucked up mom.

2257
02:18:00.280 --> 02:18:04.420
Chokes man honey,
y'all,
y'all actually got one in in the UFC?
Yes he did.

2258
02:18:05.220 --> 02:18:08.360
Yeah,
I think he did too.
Yeah.
You don't call people goon anymore?
No.

2259
02:18:08.460 --> 02:18:12.460
It's a nasty technique.
Super Nasty.
Who Else fucking did that?
Someone did.

2260
02:18:12.461 --> 02:18:16.540
That was a honker narrow.
Did he nail one?
Did he land one recently?
I feel like

2261
02:18:18.080 --> 02:18:21.080
I'm smarter than him cause he did that.
Somebody,

2262
02:18:21.620 --> 02:18:26.140
somebody got that north south choke recently.
I don't remember.
But that's it.

2263
02:18:26.141 --> 02:18:29.780
So whatever,
it's a super effective technique.
But when you said it,

2264
02:18:29.820 --> 02:18:31.660
you know like he goon to him and I was like,

2265
02:18:31.661 --> 02:18:34.630
I've everything I made that up I think.
Oh,
I don't think you did either,

2266
02:18:34.631 --> 02:18:36.910
but you said it to me.
It's a great term.
But yeah,

2267
02:18:36.911 --> 02:18:39.430
it's like the term just brought it back and

2268
02:18:42.610 --> 02:18:43.330
she,

2269
02:18:43.330 --> 02:18:46.750
I think you're totally right that she brought it on herself and a lot of way and

2270
02:18:46.751 --> 02:18:50.230
what will make someone excited about a guy like Floyd Mayweather pulling it off

2271
02:18:50.380 --> 02:18:53.860
and laying those stacks of paper.
If he did get chaos.
Q,

2272
02:18:53.870 --> 02:18:56.960
imagine if Manny same shell landed or bombings shit,

2273
02:18:57.020 --> 02:19:01.870
he gets so much God.
But meanwhile when Manny got knocked out,
but man,
one,

2274
02:19:01.871 --> 02:19:05.150
Mel Marquez,
yes.
Mean there was almost none of that.
There's was like,
whoa.

2275
02:19:05.151 --> 02:19:08.920
It was like a meme here.
You felt bad for him because he's a good person.
I mean,

2276
02:19:08.921 --> 02:19:12.760
or as you don't have bad intentions.
He's like,
well,
I hope the fight goes good.

2277
02:19:13.480 --> 02:19:17.320
Floyd is,
I already go back to everybody.
All right,
cool man.

2278
02:19:18.760 --> 02:19:21.160
Thank you Jesus.
I was weird,
Dan,

2279
02:19:21.161 --> 02:19:24.030
for as much as she is getting kind of meme don and,

2280
02:19:24.031 --> 02:19:26.370
and people messing with her and whatnot,
would you,

2281
02:19:26.410 --> 02:19:28.520
would you say that's probably the most expensive

2282
02:19:28.520 --> 02:19:32.600
<v 2>head kick knockout anybody's ever been paid?
Um,
yeah,</v>

2283
02:19:32.601 --> 02:19:36.380
probably right.
No one ever probably made as much money as she did.

2284
02:19:36.680 --> 02:19:39.830
Like when you think about like she has a percentage of pay per view buys that

2285
02:19:39.831 --> 02:19:43.330
was over a million paper view bars.
No Way.
Yes it is.
Yeah.

2286
02:19:46.640 --> 02:19:51.640
No,
no,
no.
Some of the GSP GSPS Brock's.
Yeah,
they,
Brock,

2287
02:19:52.650 --> 02:19:56.110
Brock,
Brock Brock.
Probably the biggest,
there's still no,

2288
02:19:57.790 --> 02:20:00.260
the rematch with Holly Holm.
We'll probably break records.

2289
02:20:00.500 --> 02:20:04.640
That's why Holly's not going to fight anyone else because that's the UFC fight.

2290
02:20:04.670 --> 02:20:07.850
But wouldn't you say that from just the injury alone?

2291
02:20:07.880 --> 02:20:10.310
Just to for the head kick alone,
she needs,

2292
02:20:10.430 --> 02:20:14.680
like when Freddy Roach was willing to work with PAC yogan after the one,

2293
02:20:14.681 --> 02:20:18.470
when Mel Marcus fight,
he said,
I want you to take a year off.
I agree with Rhonda.

2294
02:20:18.471 --> 02:20:21.340
Go do all the movies you want a year.
You think a year,

2295
02:20:21.910 --> 02:20:24.830
you're not going to wait a year.
It's gonna have to fight somewhere else.

2296
02:20:25.010 --> 02:20:28.300
The other thing is the pressure from the UFC and Dana and Ronda being so close

2297
02:20:28.301 --> 02:20:31.400
is this can be tougher to be like,
no,
I won't take a year off.
Right.

2298
02:20:31.401 --> 02:20:35.540
But she needs a significant amount of time a year.

2299
02:20:35.570 --> 02:20:40.300
It should be several months with no contact,
nothing.
Nothing now,
now,

2300
02:20:40.450 --> 02:20:43.670
now is are the people surrounding her if they're looking out for her best

2301
02:20:43.671 --> 02:20:45.080
interest,
I thinking allowed her to do that.

2302
02:20:45.260 --> 02:20:49.640
Let's see who's really in her corner there.
Of course you say,
take a year off.

2303
02:20:49.670 --> 02:20:51.050
Let's just clear everything.

2304
02:20:51.110 --> 02:20:54.470
Take a year off and do your thing and she was a strong will.

2305
02:20:54.560 --> 02:20:57.920
She might think she can come back sooner than she can write and that's where

2306
02:20:57.921 --> 02:21:00.830
your fucking people around you should be like,
no,
we know you want to.

2307
02:21:00.950 --> 02:21:03.720
Here's what we're,
this is the game plan.
She needs to be like,

2308
02:21:04.100 --> 02:21:06.790
here's the game plan.
You're off,

2309
02:21:06.830 --> 02:21:11.510
but a of everything except wrestling.
She should move to Iowa by a ranch.

2310
02:21:13.070 --> 02:21:17.110
Just can't fly him here.
Buy a ranch that you got to sell that ranch after

2311
02:21:20.390 --> 02:21:21.223
ranch.

2312
02:21:21.530 --> 02:21:25.750
Russel Russel Russel Russel's selling some ships,

2313
02:21:26.220 --> 02:21:29.630
Houma for a couple of months,
Iowa for another couple months.
Illinois.

2314
02:21:29.900 --> 02:21:33.650
Just hang out with all them wrestlers or just make a shitload of movies for a

2315
02:21:33.650 --> 02:21:37.340
year and then just do your thing.
There's some good wrestling in California.

2316
02:21:37.341 --> 02:21:41.900
You have plenty of good wrestlers get away from all this shit.
She needs to go.

2317
02:21:41.901 --> 02:21:45.560
She knows she needs a break,
man.
Kornfield yeah.
Kornfield and run.

2318
02:21:45.770 --> 02:21:48.170
Run it like or anything like that.
Kevin Costner,

2319
02:21:48.171 --> 02:21:52.640
movie field of dreams to have for the HPL.
Rhonda movie comes out just,

2320
02:21:52.730 --> 02:21:57.680
Oh man,
that's tough.
That's tough to sell now rowdy.

2321
02:21:57.740 --> 02:22:01.310
It isn't.
If she comes back,
if she comes back,
this is the best.

2322
02:22:01.460 --> 02:22:04.660
It's better than ever.
Now.
Only if she went to combat everyone.

2323
02:22:04.700 --> 02:22:06.170
Rocky lawsuit against Mr Too.

2324
02:22:06.171 --> 02:22:09.230
The first time they fought twice in rocky three and he got his ass kicked in the

2325
02:22:09.231 --> 02:22:10.560
first one.
Do you know

2326
02:22:16.910 --> 02:22:20.930
what I'm talking about?
Listening to this.
That's how you get people excited.

2327
02:22:22.680 --> 02:22:26.190
Hi,
you got one hour sleep at my gun.
Ambient.

2328
02:22:26.310 --> 02:22:27.790
<v 1>Hey,
rocky got beat.</v>

2329
02:22:31.800 --> 02:22:34.050
He got knocked out one hour,
20 minute mark.

2330
02:22:34.051 --> 02:22:36.930
I thought how much speed was going to lose because the movie

2331
02:22:40.670 --> 02:22:44.530
wasn't a,
right now there's still 40 in the the movie.

2332
02:22:44.760 --> 02:22:48.040
This is where she comes back.
There's a comeback.

2333
02:22:48.060 --> 02:22:51.420
This is when she moved to Iowa instead of rocky.
Go in the fucking mountains.

2334
02:22:51.510 --> 02:22:55.710
She's there in Iowa by yourself,
right?
That part of the,

2335
02:22:55.720 --> 02:23:00.350
they actually show,
you know what she's working on her autobiography.
What?

2336
02:23:00.660 --> 02:23:02.870
Now?
She's got the best part of it.
Well,
she had the a

2337
02:23:02.870 --> 02:23:05.420
<v 0>book already,
right?
You've got the book.
The book's already come out.</v>

2338
02:23:06.740 --> 02:23:10.210
They don't this here.
There's no end chapter in that.

2339
02:23:11.500 --> 02:23:15.860
They need to fucking fill in extra chapter downloads or clients to beat a dead

2340
02:23:15.861 --> 02:23:16.990
go rocky three of them.

2341
02:23:17.000 --> 02:23:21.310
You know what's really crazy is that she's the favorite in the rematch.
Yeah,

2342
02:23:21.311 --> 02:23:23.630
it's pretty nuts.
I don't know what,
that's fucking insane.

2343
02:23:23.660 --> 02:23:26.910
What are you basing that?
Who's making the odds?
That seems some,
some,

2344
02:23:26.960 --> 02:23:29.970
some of the already odds for a fight that's not going to have them.
Yeah,

2345
02:23:30.040 --> 02:23:33.050
they do that all the time.
Like there's odds for a John Deasy already,

2346
02:23:33.520 --> 02:23:37.450
but you can't,
can you bet?
Can you throw money to get bet yet?
No.
No.

2347
02:23:38.090 --> 02:23:42.290
So it's nice yards.
They establish odds just to,
what does a jerk off probably.

2348
02:23:43.220 --> 02:23:47.300
Here's a look.
Yeah,
Jack off online.

2349
02:23:47.630 --> 02:23:51.380
It seems to me that you can't make Holly anything but the favorite.

2350
02:23:51.770 --> 02:23:55.580
When I put in the mansion,
we saw them fight.
We saw how it played out.

2351
02:23:55.581 --> 02:23:58.520
We saw strong Holly.
Look,
we saw Holly Take Rhonda down.

2352
02:23:58.640 --> 02:24:00.950
We saw Holly completely light are upstanding.

2353
02:24:01.130 --> 02:24:05.030
I knew like early in the first round Rhonda was in trouble.
Trouble.
Yes.

2354
02:24:05.540 --> 02:24:09.270
I see that.
Look on her face.
Well it's also the hollies movement.
Agree.

2355
02:24:09.290 --> 02:24:13.150
She was so light on her feet and she was countering so well.
It's like invest.

2356
02:24:13.160 --> 02:24:16.310
Rhonda lands a bump.
She did land one good left hook,

2357
02:24:16.460 --> 02:24:20.650
but it was right before Holly took her down like she landed one good laptop is

2358
02:24:20.730 --> 02:24:25.670
old boxing fights and she eats some fucking shots from world class box and

2359
02:24:25.671 --> 02:24:27.620
opponents and just keeps on keeping on.

2360
02:24:27.621 --> 02:24:30.620
Did you see the one fight where she got Koi?
Yes.
That's hard to watch.

2361
02:24:30.830 --> 02:24:33.620
The fights great though.
It's,
it's back and forth like a motherfucker.

2362
02:24:33.720 --> 02:24:37.640
It's a brutal,
brutal Kale through the,
through the ropes.
Dude.

2363
02:24:37.641 --> 02:24:40.240
I had a guy in Starbucks asked me,
I wanted to slap the fuck.

2364
02:24:40.241 --> 02:24:44.030
I'm fill this scolding hot coffee on him.
He goes,
hey man,

2365
02:24:44.060 --> 02:24:48.950
heard the fight was fixed.
Oh my God,
I get that a ton.
Hey,

2366
02:24:48.980 --> 02:24:52.520
I heard that fight was fixed.
You fucking moron.
Yeah.
Rhonda was like,

2367
02:24:52.521 --> 02:24:56.930
let's fix this fight and this fight.
You're going to outclass me on the feet.

2368
02:24:57.020 --> 02:25:00.540
And then the second round fucking kicked my head off because that's how we're,

2369
02:25:00.590 --> 02:25:03.200
we want this to be so dumb.
They shouldn't be able to talk.

2370
02:25:03.350 --> 02:25:06.590
There's some people that are walking amongst us that might as well be like

2371
02:25:06.620 --> 02:25:10.370
shrews out in the forest,
straight up foraging for roots and berries.

2372
02:25:10.850 --> 02:25:11.950
They might as well be just,

2373
02:25:11.951 --> 02:25:15.590
but they live in a society where they can get a job doing some stupid move this

2374
02:25:15.591 --> 02:25:18.500
box over there,
oak,
her world.

2375
02:25:18.590 --> 02:25:21.920
And they go and do that and then they get health insurance and then they
survive.

2376
02:25:22.220 --> 02:25:24.160
And then they fucking go to the hospital

2377
02:25:24.160 --> 02:25:27.900
<v 2>and someone way smarter than them fixes whatever things wrong with that man.</v>

2378
02:25:28.660 --> 02:25:31.690
And they pretend like they're people,
but they're not the like talking shrewd.

2379
02:25:31.710 --> 02:25:35.140
This guy was like mad cause I looked down and go,
you serious?
And he goes,
dude,

2380
02:25:35.141 --> 02:25:38.530
it's not,
it's not crazy to think that I'm like fucking insane.

2381
02:25:39.020 --> 02:25:41.320
That's just stupid as fuck.
Stupid as fuck.

2382
02:25:41.530 --> 02:25:43.570
That's like you shouldn't be able to comment on finding.

2383
02:25:43.571 --> 02:25:45.790
If you think that that looks like a fake fight,

2384
02:25:46.060 --> 02:25:48.970
like that's like me looking at an airplane going,
how's that flying bro?

2385
02:25:48.971 --> 02:25:53.320
It's metal.
I know,
bro.
It's Ma.
How's it was something metal fly.
It's crazy.

2386
02:25:53.321 --> 02:25:57.420
Shut the fuck up.
Like it's really that stupid to think there's surveys,

2387
02:25:57.430 --> 02:26:00.910
conspiracy theory where they were like,
Alex have Rhonda loose.
No.

2388
02:26:00.911 --> 02:26:04.030
That's the worst thing that could happen for them.
Conspiracies.

2389
02:26:07.340 --> 02:26:10.930
That was a perfect segway into tower seven if you think Rocky's chem trails,

2390
02:26:11.740 --> 02:26:14.730
rocky
real

2391
02:26:17.970 --> 02:26:21.430
movies are made of.
She's in the middle of a real movie.
No,
I get it now.

2392
02:26:21.431 --> 02:26:24.500
She's in the middle of some real shit.
Some real shit.
This is,

2393
02:26:26.450 --> 02:26:29.620
oh,
we totally understand what you're talking about.
Rocky.
Three minutes.

2394
02:26:30.210 --> 02:26:34.500
You look at it a long time ago we got it.
Holly Holm is clubber lane.

2395
02:26:34.510 --> 02:26:37.950
If you look at the difference between her life just a couple of months ago and

2396
02:26:37.951 --> 02:26:42.400
her life now,
boy,
she's aunt after Brazil.
She's on top of the fucking world,

2397
02:26:42.550 --> 02:26:46.440
right?
She's cheered in Brazil Beats Batchko.
Hey,
by Kao,

2398
02:26:46.450 --> 02:26:49.420
the whole thing is just spectacular.
The whole world falls at her feet.

2399
02:26:49.600 --> 02:26:53.200
Was it ESPN or sports illustrated called it the greatest female athlete ever.

2400
02:26:53.320 --> 02:26:57.100
She's on the cover of ring.
Who Was it?
Was it cover ring magazine?

2401
02:26:57.250 --> 02:27:01.300
I was either ESPN horse follows those trade one of them,
but whatever it is,

2402
02:27:02.250 --> 02:27:04.420
she went an sp for fighter of the year,

2403
02:27:04.421 --> 02:27:08.800
beat up Floyd Mayweather and then Holly Holm said,
that's cool.
Check this out.

2404
02:27:10.390 --> 02:27:11.223
And then shotgun

2405
02:27:14.610 --> 02:27:18.110
kicked that bitch and fucking 1997 it was not.
Here we are.

2406
02:27:18.160 --> 02:27:19.720
That head kick to men.

2407
02:27:19.870 --> 02:27:23.410
The way she did it where Rhonda was like stumbling back and she didn't even see

2408
02:27:23.411 --> 02:27:26.560
it.
Common cause like Eve Edward Dude,
every person camps,

2409
02:27:26.590 --> 02:27:30.670
every person who tells me in her camp,
every person goes,
yeah bro,
no injuries.

2410
02:27:31.480 --> 02:27:35.020
Well No,
I get that.
But her brain's probably pretty fucked up.
No Man,
no injuries.

2411
02:27:35.021 --> 02:27:39.930
Like,
oh my look at me.
Can you say that?
How can anybody say that it is?

2412
02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:40.580
It's,
it's,

2413
02:27:40.580 --> 02:27:45.120
it's dangerous for the sport to pretend that that wasn't a devastating,

2414
02:27:45.820 --> 02:27:47.710
devastating care.
It's dangerous.

2415
02:27:47.770 --> 02:27:52.240
That's the Kale in the history of combat sports for women,

2416
02:27:52.600 --> 02:27:55.870
not for men,
Cro,
cop and Gonzaga,
Gonzaga,
Cro,
cop,

2417
02:27:55.871 --> 02:28:00.871
all crossfit's and pride that was dealt colon so big.

2418
02:28:01.530 --> 02:28:02.650
The reason it's so big,

2419
02:28:02.770 --> 02:28:07.770
we never seen someone of that caliber like to see someone that has that inner

2420
02:28:08.711 --> 02:28:11.550
prime star get knocked the fuck out by him.

2421
02:28:11.770 --> 02:28:14.050
And that way you're right in that way.
You're right.
Yeah.

2422
02:28:14.051 --> 02:28:18.520
That'd be like if v toward did that to John Jones when they fought for the
title.

2423
02:28:18.550 --> 02:28:22.100
Yes,
exactly.
Tour like rock holding them.
Then you're like,

2424
02:28:22.100 --> 02:28:26.120
<v 0>what the fuck?
But when cro cop and Gonzaga fight,
it was big,</v>

2425
02:28:26.121 --> 02:28:30.580
but cro cop was on fucking the on TMZ every day,
you know?
Right,
right,
right.
Yes.

2426
02:28:31.100 --> 02:28:35.660
Star wise.
Yeah.
It's the biggest one ever.
And it was pretty God damn devastating.

2427
02:28:35.870 --> 02:28:38.810
And then when you consider the fact that she got lit up for all those,

2428
02:28:38.880 --> 02:28:43.670
all those hard shots in the first round taken down,
taken that,
but really the,

2429
02:28:43.671 --> 02:28:43.850
the,

2430
02:28:43.850 --> 02:28:48.680
the Chatelet she ate to her face and then the big head kick comes in the second

2431
02:28:48.681 --> 02:28:52.850
round.
Like boom,
after missing that crazy wild left hook.

2432
02:28:53.180 --> 02:28:57.260
Holly ducks under everyone's like,
no,
her lips fine.

2433
02:28:57.650 --> 02:29:02.030
It doesn't matter man.
No,
her lip got fucking split.
She has stitches.

2434
02:29:02.560 --> 02:29:05.170
Okay.
On the ground.

2435
02:29:05.900 --> 02:29:09.860
Fairly was looking for,
Holly has the arm hooked.

2436
02:29:09.861 --> 02:29:13.570
She didn't have the arm hooked like it wasn't,
it wasn't really a controls.
Yeah,

2437
02:29:13.790 --> 02:29:17.630
but the thing about like the Kao is it's not about what you've seen in the

2438
02:29:17.631 --> 02:29:20.840
outside.
Obviously her nose is bleeding or she had blood in her mouth.

2439
02:29:21.290 --> 02:29:24.890
Whatever stitches she had to have on her lip,
that's all going to be,
that's fine.

2440
02:29:25.160 --> 02:29:29.840
But inside the dome that's,
that's a head kick.
Brains or brains.

2441
02:29:29.870 --> 02:29:33.980
Honestly,
the face plant to face plant was

2442
02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:38.390
the last time you sold a females get fucked up.

2443
02:29:38.391 --> 02:29:41.390
Like Yo and Holly's got some thighs on her dude.

2444
02:29:41.540 --> 02:29:46.430
I bet there's a lot of pop to those kids because those like the way she bounces

2445
02:29:46.431 --> 02:29:51.260
around the octagon,
that's some serious,
did you call it before on a,

2446
02:29:51.261 --> 02:29:52.910
on a sh like Jimmy Kimmel.
She's like,

2447
02:29:52.911 --> 02:29:56.090
she thinks she's going to kick me in the head but it's not.
I don't think so.

2448
02:29:57.030 --> 02:30:01.490
You're going to get me frustrated.
She called her at all.
She really did.
You know,

2449
02:30:01.520 --> 02:30:05.240
I think you have to live a stoic,

2450
02:30:05.270 --> 02:30:09.350
singular existence to be a fighter at the highest level when you're fighting

2451
02:30:09.351 --> 02:30:12.770
someone is dangerous as like a Holly Holm and that's what Holly did.

2452
02:30:13.040 --> 02:30:17.450
She lived a stoic singular existed.
She lived for a purpose.
You know,

2453
02:30:17.540 --> 02:30:20.960
she did her media obligations but she trained like a fucking wild beast.

2454
02:30:21.200 --> 02:30:22.033
She didn't have any movies.

2455
02:30:22.080 --> 02:30:26.750
Tractions didn't have all this other stuff since she was 15 and the same staff

2456
02:30:26.780 --> 02:30:29.030
and she's gotten nasty skills man.

2457
02:30:29.060 --> 02:30:33.260
And she's based in real championship fights multiple times like you and while we

2458
02:30:33.261 --> 02:30:35.690
have,
why didn't we see this coming?
I agree.

2459
02:30:36.060 --> 02:30:38.900
Will you go back to the fight podcasts the last no,

2460
02:30:38.930 --> 02:30:40.820
we all said it was ridiculous.
I am done.

2461
02:30:41.090 --> 02:30:44.600
I thought that Amanda Nunez will be more dangerous.
Fire hunted ditches.
See,

2462
02:30:44.780 --> 02:30:49.150
she'd just finished a Sara McMann.
He's got Kale power.
I agree with luck.

2463
02:30:49.151 --> 02:30:51.440
Cat Zingano up in that first round pretty bad.
I was like,

2464
02:30:51.490 --> 02:30:54.140
she's a dangerous fight.
Yes,
Amanda Nunez is dangerous,

2465
02:30:54.380 --> 02:30:57.470
but if you all were all wrong,
all wrong.

2466
02:30:57.530 --> 02:31:01.850
If you go back and if the fight is what really threw me off,
I agree.

2467
02:31:01.851 --> 02:31:05.810
Her previous experiences and previous fights,
I was like,
ah,

2468
02:31:05.870 --> 02:31:10.070
I don't really see it.
She let it go.
Go back and look at Qualys resume like,

2469
02:31:10.100 --> 02:31:12.680
oh fuck yeah man.
Fuck yeah.

2470
02:31:13.340 --> 02:31:17.240
When she was bouncing around in the octagon to,
you're like,
this is like,

2471
02:31:17.270 --> 02:31:20.040
she's just like cut some serious movement.
You know?
There

2472
02:31:20.040 --> 02:31:24.270
<v 2>was no one that she's been robbed that ever fought the talk that compare her to</v>

2473
02:31:24.271 --> 02:31:28.020
like Alexis Davis.
I mean,
there's just no comparison in the movement.
No,

2474
02:31:28.021 --> 02:31:30.600
she made Sarah McMahon looked like a tortoise.
You know what I'm saying?

2475
02:31:30.601 --> 02:31:32.880
Like chief,
why Sam Mcmahon's like a tank,
you know,

2476
02:31:33.270 --> 02:31:35.520
she didn't even try to hide it.
She came right in the ring.

2477
02:31:35.521 --> 02:31:38.520
She showed exactly what she was going to do the entire time.
She always does.

2478
02:31:38.521 --> 02:31:41.970
She's coming in while they're doing the,
the name call outs.
She's like,

2479
02:31:41.971 --> 02:31:43.230
I'm going to be going left and right.

2480
02:31:43.260 --> 02:31:47.280
When Rhonda went to thrill that left hook and she just and ran to the cage,

2481
02:31:47.490 --> 02:31:51.850
she turns around like,
what the fuck?
She was already made trays,

2482
02:31:52.090 --> 02:31:54.360
the fucking matrix.
She was already in trouble.

2483
02:31:54.420 --> 02:31:58.780
She had chameleon like eyes are here like fucking,
Oh God.
Oh,

2484
02:31:58.980 --> 02:32:02.070
it's not snowflake.
It's weird for the world to see that.

2485
02:32:02.070 --> 02:32:04.740
But I think like we're saying like ultimately,

2486
02:32:04.741 --> 02:32:09.741
I think for martial arts it's good because you have to know that you got to have

2487
02:32:10.350 --> 02:32:13.860
all your ducks in order and you have to know that you got to be able to do

2488
02:32:13.861 --> 02:32:18.720
everything at the high friends and stay humble.
Stay thirsty.

2489
02:32:18.721 --> 02:32:20.880
My friend.
Stay humble motherfuckers.
Yeah.

2490
02:32:20.881 --> 02:32:22.630
Otherwise you're gonna get kicked into humbleness,

2491
02:32:22.680 --> 02:32:25.140
but there's a lot of money and not being just going to say,

2492
02:32:25.141 --> 02:32:29.040
I was about to say they're at,
they'll Conor McGregor,
he talked some shit,

2493
02:32:29.041 --> 02:32:32.250
but after the fight they,
he gives respect and he's humble.

2494
02:32:32.290 --> 02:32:36.510
Rollicking guys like he's a great champion.
You know,
this guy has great skills.

2495
02:32:36.750 --> 02:32:39.780
Ron does not like that,
man.
That's why everyone these means,

2496
02:32:39.781 --> 02:32:43.110
and I'll ship coming out.
Even Floyd Mayweather is humble after.
He's like,
dude,

2497
02:32:43.111 --> 02:32:47.250
he's a great fighter,
man.
Yeah,
yeah.
That's what you're saying.

2498
02:32:47.520 --> 02:32:50.880
What does that,
what does that from I think,
I think it's uh,
uh,

2499
02:32:50.970 --> 02:32:52.800
this anger that she has to fight with this,

2500
02:32:52.801 --> 02:32:56.790
this whole that she's had since losing her dad.
It's just this dark darkness.

2501
02:32:56.791 --> 02:33:01.320
You know what I'm saying?
It's tough,
man.
Dude just killed my day.

2502
02:33:01.530 --> 02:33:05.820
He just went there and I just went there.
That's dark shit gets real.

2503
02:33:06.150 --> 02:33:08.940
It's like for martial artists though,

2504
02:33:08.941 --> 02:33:13.941
when you watch that fight is such an important lesson that regardless of hype,

2505
02:33:14.250 --> 02:33:16.230
regardless of past accomplishments,

2506
02:33:16.440 --> 02:33:20.250
regardless of of past performances that have looked spectacular,

2507
02:33:20.560 --> 02:33:24.120
got to analyze all the movement,
especially in the u s everything.

2508
02:33:24.121 --> 02:33:27.570
Especially when you see like boxing,
you can start off a round or two.

2509
02:33:27.571 --> 02:33:29.550
You might see a box to go down four rounds,
whatever,

2510
02:33:29.551 --> 02:33:34.230
and they come back in the UFC.
There is no,
all right,
I'm going to figure it out.

2511
02:33:34.290 --> 02:33:38.100
No Man,
especially got a world class level.
They're going to Merck you out.

2512
02:33:38.280 --> 02:33:43.080
There's so many ways to lose room.
There's some room for error at that level.

2513
02:33:43.081 --> 02:33:46.260
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah.
It's pretty crazy.

2514
02:33:46.500 --> 02:33:50.520
Pretty crazy to watch such a shift,
like a changing,

2515
02:33:50.521 --> 02:33:55.080
not just a changing of the guards,
but like Gosh,
just a shifting of reality.

2516
02:33:55.110 --> 02:33:56.790
Is there a Duane Ludwig of wrestling,

2517
02:33:57.060 --> 02:34:00.240
a guy who's a taken dudes that weren't that good at wrestling and now they're

2518
02:34:00.241 --> 02:34:04.920
just taking Easter bowling,
bowling,
muscle farm.
Jim leasers great.

2519
02:34:05.840 --> 02:34:09.240
It did.
Tj Dillashaw there now,
uh,
Neil Magnus,

2520
02:34:09.241 --> 02:34:11.910
he's got to get on the wrestling that year off.
Should be restless.

2521
02:34:11.911 --> 02:34:15.060
A bunch of guys.
Kenny Johnson.
There's a ton of good guys.
Yeah,

2522
02:34:15.390 --> 02:34:16.830
a lot a lot of people could help her with,

2523
02:34:17.800 --> 02:34:20.800
but all she sent in had a good point about her knees though.

2524
02:34:22.180 --> 02:34:24.780
Adoptation man.
I mean,
everyone's different.
If you've got bad,

2525
02:34:25.540 --> 02:34:30.100
like Rhonda can't do regard.
She doesn't do roadwork.

2526
02:34:30.400 --> 02:34:31.940
No.
Like you see a jog on the sand,

2527
02:34:31.941 --> 02:34:34.900
but she can't jump on the road and do work to the fucker needs up.
Wow.

2528
02:34:35.020 --> 02:34:38.260
Do you think she'd been doing judo since she was in diapers?
That's some shit,

2529
02:34:38.261 --> 02:34:38.921
man.
The hall,

2530
02:34:38.921 --> 02:34:43.240
they're tossing all the knee movement had a body that I was shredded knee from

2531
02:34:43.241 --> 02:34:48.070
judo.
Judo is gnarly man and [inaudible] especially doing that.
Her level what?

2532
02:34:48.460 --> 02:34:53.230
Yeah.
Yeah man.
Yeah.
Well wonder if they could get that stem cell shit.

2533
02:34:53.231 --> 02:34:55.740
Shoot it in there.
I'm shopping back up.

2534
02:34:56.380 --> 02:35:01.380
It's going to be very interesting times because Holly's also 34 so you've got to

2535
02:35:01.391 --> 02:35:04.240
think like how much longer can she compete at this level?

2536
02:35:04.380 --> 02:35:07.990
Like without any performance enhancing drugs.
Let's just be honest,
right?

2537
02:35:08.660 --> 02:35:12.610
That when you start hitting the thirties it starts to wane.

2538
02:35:12.670 --> 02:35:17.200
The body stops.
Especially with experience.
Yeah,
like when we were kids,
boxers,

2539
02:35:17.380 --> 02:35:22.000
when they would hit like 34 35 it was over five,
no NFL running backs.

2540
02:35:22.060 --> 02:35:24.380
As soon as they hit 30 game over that.
If you,

2541
02:35:24.381 --> 02:35:29.020
if you're 28 they're little sketchy 30th 30 year.

2542
02:35:29.080 --> 02:35:30.490
You're taking a back to the shed.

2543
02:35:30.491 --> 02:35:33.520
But what's crazy is that because of the damage that you take?
Yeah,
man.

2544
02:35:33.521 --> 02:35:37.420
All the wear and tear after 30 it never works out after a couple of knee

2545
02:35:37.421 --> 02:35:39.160
surgeries and you're running back.

2546
02:35:40.950 --> 02:35:45.850
That's why there's been so many scrambling quarterbacks that they come into the

2547
02:35:45.851 --> 02:35:49.510
NFL and this one's going to scramble his way to a super bowl and they're

2548
02:35:49.511 --> 02:35:51.520
scramblers are hard like Michael Vick.

2549
02:35:51.670 --> 02:35:55.210
But then they get hurt once they hit her twice and now they can't scramble.

2550
02:35:55.211 --> 02:35:57.900
Now they're forced to throw in the pocket.
Then they're,

2551
02:35:57.930 --> 02:35:58.930
the career's falling apart.

2552
02:35:59.080 --> 02:36:02.070
What's going to be interesting to see it in the UFC after,
if,

2553
02:36:02.110 --> 02:36:04.750
let's say Rhonda would just be like,
you know what?
Fuck this noise on Mount.

2554
02:36:04.751 --> 02:36:09.610
I got so much money on scrooge McDuck of girls.
So he,
she,
she pieces out,

2555
02:36:10.090 --> 02:36:12.070
you know what I'm saying?
What happens to women's MMA?

2556
02:36:12.340 --> 02:36:16.120
Because you can paint it how you want,
but there's no,
Rhonda made women's MMA.

2557
02:36:16.210 --> 02:36:20.600
She's a superstar.
There's no other headline like her.
No,
no,

2558
02:36:22.880 --> 02:36:26.020
nope,
nope.
You can't have pages,
a main event on a pay per view,

2559
02:36:26.050 --> 02:36:30.520
which never happened against Johannah.
No,
that's not a main event.

2560
02:36:30.550 --> 02:36:34.180
That's not going to sell.
First of all,
what I said about Rhonda.
No,

2561
02:36:34.181 --> 02:36:36.840
they didn't [inaudible] since day one.
Hey,

2562
02:36:36.841 --> 02:36:39.280
it's doesn't have the kind of skills that Rhonda has yet.

2563
02:36:39.310 --> 02:36:41.770
She didn't have the finish rate.
She should have my x factor.

2564
02:36:41.800 --> 02:36:45.190
She might be able to develop those cause she's really young and she's only been

2565
02:36:45.191 --> 02:36:49.210
fighting for a short amount of time.
I mean,
Paige,
she's,
she's very scrappy.

2566
02:36:49.211 --> 02:36:53.170
She's very attractive too,
which is a plus.
She tries,
she trains hard.

2567
02:36:53.171 --> 02:36:57.480
She fights hard.
She's not Ronda Rousey.
Not yet,
but she could beat,

2568
02:36:57.550 --> 02:37:00.040
I'm just saying right now,
if Rhonda dips out,

2569
02:37:00.160 --> 02:37:04.780
Holly Holm versus Miesha Tate,
it's a co main event.

2570
02:37:04.900 --> 02:37:07.000
There's a dude as a main event.
There's no one,

2571
02:37:07.030 --> 02:37:10.800
no other girl right now who would carry a paper view cart batshit crazy thing.

2572
02:37:10.801 --> 02:37:14.320
Holly Cow.
You're crazy.
Carry a card right now.

2573
02:37:15.020 --> 02:37:18.620
A page vans that will be,
uh,
that could have line of show that may fight night.

2574
02:37:18.710 --> 02:37:22.460
You don't think Misha Tate versus Holly Holm could,
could headline of paper view?

2575
02:37:22.490 --> 02:37:24.100
Not at all.
What about,
what's it called?

2576
02:37:25.050 --> 02:37:29.510
I think that's a Komito of any aggressive about Cyborg.
Holly Holm.
I thought.

2577
02:37:29.530 --> 02:37:33.790
Yeah.
Yeah,
but it's a main event.
But does the general public knows Cyborg?

2578
02:37:33.791 --> 02:37:37.750
That's what I'm saying.
They could change that real quick.
No,
we can't see.

2579
02:37:38.270 --> 02:37:39.830
Throw out the marketing machine.
Boom.

2580
02:37:39.831 --> 02:37:44.020
They got so much power they could blow cyborg dog.
Fuck disagree.

2581
02:37:44.120 --> 02:37:45.800
He want to go deep with the marketing.

2582
02:37:45.801 --> 02:37:49.210
Do you mention the fact that cyborgs tested positive for stuff?

2583
02:37:51.460 --> 02:37:54.080
The media,
the media is going to find out and just,

2584
02:37:54.470 --> 02:37:58.670
I mean cause if you have cyber listen Cyberhair you don't make it like,

2585
02:37:58.760 --> 02:38:03.760
like this isn't that more enticing but with her looks that's rocky slope by that

2586
02:38:05.060 --> 02:38:09.480
then you're like,
what the fuck are we doing?
Well everybody,
me,
man,

2587
02:38:09.540 --> 02:38:13.730
a meat heads or some bros,
the general population.
No,

2588
02:38:13.731 --> 02:38:17.720
I love women Bro.
Come on Bro.

2589
02:38:18.600 --> 02:38:20.650
I mean when I paid for that weather girl

2590
02:38:25.160 --> 02:38:28.720
saying what Rhonda did for the sport,
there's no one even close.

2591
02:38:29.710 --> 02:38:34.490
The girls are covering right now.
But you go to like,
like Cyborg footage.

2592
02:38:34.491 --> 02:38:36.540
What's,
what was amazing about Cyborg?

2593
02:38:36.541 --> 02:38:40.550
Like when she beat Gina was how terrifying she was.
Like there was a,

2594
02:38:40.730 --> 02:38:44.840
was a different kind of force and that was swollen.

2595
02:38:44.960 --> 02:38:47.930
She was chasing down gene.
It's just,
it was a different thing.

2596
02:38:47.931 --> 02:38:52.490
It was scary to see.
It was a very aggressive,
powerful energy.
Now if you,

2597
02:38:52.640 --> 02:38:57.640
if you add that to like accusations and you show the positive test results and

2598
02:38:58.491 --> 02:39:01.450
then she's your chocolate quick.
Yeah.
Okay.
Then she's your champion.

2599
02:39:01.460 --> 02:39:02.760
When I was the women's MMA,
it goes

2600
02:39:05.010 --> 02:39:07.250
with six months of sprawl training.

2601
02:39:08.670 --> 02:39:10.460
Mike Tyson bitches.

2602
02:39:11.180 --> 02:39:16.180
Six months is fraud training pubs out flying knee.

2603
02:39:17.650 --> 02:39:21.500
You imagine how fast that girl could explode you about how she explodes off the

2604
02:39:21.501 --> 02:39:25.460
line.
Like two tennis.
They have to explode,
left and explode,
right?
Coordination.

2605
02:39:25.490 --> 02:39:27.810
Teach her a flying knee.
Oh,

2606
02:39:28.050 --> 02:39:31.840
Chabot launches through the air.
Boom.

2607
02:39:32.000 --> 02:39:37.000
Not asked us 10 minutes behind you doing fucking sick.

2608
02:39:39.020 --> 02:39:41.460
I wish,
man.
I'm just saying women's MMA,

2609
02:39:41.461 --> 02:39:44.150
if Rhonda pieces out has a long ways to go.
Right,

2610
02:39:44.360 --> 02:39:47.420
and Cyborg isn't your answer to champ.

2611
02:39:47.450 --> 02:39:51.470
It kills women's MMA for a little bit out there and Holly doesn't have the

2612
02:39:51.500 --> 02:39:53.460
personality to carry the torch.

2613
02:39:53.810 --> 02:39:57.030
I think she has that Randy couture personality that thinks she can agree with.

2614
02:39:57.100 --> 02:39:57.920
There's room for that.

2615
02:39:57.920 --> 02:40:01.130
There's room for that great American good girl that everyone's going to be

2616
02:40:01.131 --> 02:40:04.950
behind that who's an amazing,
the best striker.
Chris Weidman is that guy.

2617
02:40:04.951 --> 02:40:09.380
Why then,
why isn't Chris Weidman?
Chris Weidman did knock out Ronda Rousey.

2618
02:40:09.381 --> 02:40:13.100
You know,
it's not the same thing.
If there was some male version of Ronda Rousey,

2619
02:40:13.350 --> 02:40:18.120
there was like fuck the world.
You know some like Judy Browning type character,

2620
02:40:19.200 --> 02:40:24.020
a world champion and the third one you brought out Judy Brown.

2621
02:40:24.840 --> 02:40:29.160
I'm just saying a male version of that like or brash,

2622
02:40:29.340 --> 02:40:32.340
like aggressive,
but they would have to be really good too.

2623
02:40:32.520 --> 02:40:35.820
That was like dragging.
Andy would have to be undefeated smashing.

2624
02:40:35.830 --> 02:40:39.290
It would have to be like a new entity.
[inaudible] male.

2625
02:40:39.300 --> 02:40:42.870
Ronda Rousey's knocked down and just flat and Jon Jones,

2626
02:40:43.200 --> 02:40:47.340
Chris Weidman would be fucking King of the world.
He wants to fight Jon Jones.

2627
02:40:47.480 --> 02:40:51.390
You asked.
What's interesting is like,
like I said,

2628
02:40:51.391 --> 02:40:55.800
he's like one 90 something now.
Like one 93 tough eating,
right?
Yeah.

2629
02:40:55.801 --> 02:40:56.551
It's interesting.

2630
02:40:56.551 --> 02:41:00.810
Like a wonder what's without fight might not happen because John's getting

2631
02:41:00.811 --> 02:41:05.530
bigger and Chris is getting smaller,
so Chris goes to welterweight.
Look,

2632
02:41:05.630 --> 02:41:10.320
Lord,
good luck.
Everybody wanted to see those pictures of him at one 90 minutes.

2633
02:41:10.410 --> 02:41:14.970
I know that'd be really skinny for,
I would imagine as he was walking,

2634
02:41:15.890 --> 02:41:20.460
he was a baby.
I mean,
it's such a freak.

2635
02:41:20.520 --> 02:41:24.330
Such a beast.
He's a beast and he liked John Jones,

2636
02:41:24.331 --> 02:41:26.290
grew up with his brother beating the fuck out of them.

2637
02:41:26.640 --> 02:41:28.560
That's a big factor with a lot of fighters.

2638
02:41:29.100 --> 02:41:32.880
You're in competition in the house all the time.
I was,

2639
02:41:32.881 --> 02:41:37.140
you know my record against my brother.
I was one out of 3000 just a Shitty,

2640
02:41:37.141 --> 02:41:39.960
shitty record that just beat the brakes off me all the time.

2641
02:41:40.590 --> 02:41:43.470
We had to go to anger management.
He got so bad.
Oh yeah.

2642
02:41:43.510 --> 02:41:47.040
That's so funny because you're so tight now.
It's funny.
Yeah,
we're super tight.

2643
02:41:47.070 --> 02:41:49.960
That's just how that works.
Like that he's a serial killer.

2644
02:41:49.980 --> 02:41:53.100
Others have issues like that.
So like Matt Hughes and his brother,

2645
02:41:53.101 --> 02:41:54.600
you still look the same.

2646
02:41:54.630 --> 02:41:57.420
They looked exactly like each other and they would beat the fuck out of each

2647
02:41:57.421 --> 02:42:01.230
other.
Look at John Jones.
His two brothers are straight freaks ones.

2648
02:42:01.231 --> 02:42:05.700
One of the best players in the NFL.
My brother,
my brother fucked me up.
He would,

2649
02:42:05.701 --> 02:42:07.620
uh,
I would have to be a slave.

2650
02:42:07.621 --> 02:42:09.930
He was four years older than me and like when he was swelled,

2651
02:42:09.931 --> 02:42:14.400
I was eight and my mom in a summer vacation,
I was the remote control.

2652
02:42:14.401 --> 02:42:17.870
I turned off the lights.
Are you guys close now?
We're cool.
Yeah.

2653
02:42:17.880 --> 02:42:22.160
That was just like,
we're quick.
No,
no,

2654
02:42:22.910 --> 02:42:26.760
we're,
we're,
we're great.
I like,
Tufts is going to suck.

2655
02:42:26.761 --> 02:42:29.710
If you beat your brother up and your brother becomes a martial arts champion and

2656
02:42:29.730 --> 02:42:34.410
you're like,
shit,
he's a blue belt.

2657
02:42:34.411 --> 02:42:37.560
Whatever.
Clinic.
Costa Mesa.

2658
02:42:41.760 --> 02:42:46.280
A little bit of a stout sock me 10 times in the shoulder for every time I'd far,

2659
02:42:46.290 --> 02:42:47.510
he could fart anytime he wanted,

2660
02:42:47.520 --> 02:42:51.240
but if I farted I'd have to take socks to the shoulder.
Wow.
How rude.

2661
02:42:52.440 --> 02:42:54.630
He is a bully.
Weird FARC Games.

2662
02:42:58.020 --> 02:43:00.360
Eddie like to punish friends,
so he's farting on purpose.

2663
02:43:05.480 --> 02:43:07.420
Here we go.
Oh,

2664
02:43:08.040 --> 02:43:11.830
fart battles brother and sister far paddles.
You brothers or sisters been

2665
02:43:12.220 --> 02:43:16.450
<v 0>yeah.
Yeah.
I got a three brothers.
I actually got a twin fraternal twins.</v>

2666
02:43:16.960 --> 02:43:19.960
I don't know that.
Yeah,
he's a,
he doesn't do martial arts.

2667
02:43:19.961 --> 02:43:24.190
He's actually extremely passive on the physical level.
Buddy.
He was in new,

2668
02:43:24.191 --> 02:43:27.400
like a,
um,
politics and whatnot.

2669
02:43:27.460 --> 02:43:30.380
He was a man.
I forget what it is.

2670
02:43:30.400 --> 02:43:34.690
Is He for House of Representatives out in Florida?
Um,

2671
02:43:34.750 --> 02:43:36.640
so on a political and verbal level,
he,

2672
02:43:36.670 --> 02:43:39.880
he was always the guy that would like sit there and run his mouth and I would

2673
02:43:39.881 --> 02:43:44.470
get angry and emotional and punch holes.
He physically,
physically,

2674
02:43:45.220 --> 02:43:50.110
I mean he's tall too.
Uh,
um,
I'm more,
more,
more built.
Uh,

2675
02:43:50.350 --> 02:43:52.600
but I definitely have my older brother,
you know,

2676
02:43:52.601 --> 02:43:56.620
do karate and then try damn spinning back kicks on me and fucking random shit.

2677
02:43:56.621 --> 02:44:01.210
Hey,
did you stand right there?
No way,
dude.
Dick,
what an asshole.

2678
02:44:01.540 --> 02:44:06.010
<v 2>Yeah,
that's why you can't leave boys alone.
Weird shit to each other.</v>

2679
02:44:06.011 --> 02:44:09.280
Then they cover up the crime.
Oh yeah.
How did he get buried?

2680
02:44:09.910 --> 02:44:11.860
How men died and shit.

2681
02:44:15.370 --> 02:44:17.590
But it's,
it's amazing.
Like Jon Jones,
right.

2682
02:44:17.591 --> 02:44:19.840
Grows up with two super athlete brothers.

2683
02:44:20.080 --> 02:44:24.310
All three of them beat the fuck out of each other.
Sisters picked on her.
Yeah.

2684
02:44:24.400 --> 02:44:27.250
Yeah.
There you go.
Isn't that interesting how that works like that?

2685
02:44:27.700 --> 02:44:31.210
It's interesting.
It's interesting.
Like the,
the,
like Weidman.

2686
02:44:31.270 --> 02:44:34.300
I don't think Weidman,
I shouldn't talk in this cause I don't know.

2687
02:44:34.301 --> 02:44:36.880
But I know he was,
he had fights with his brother.

2688
02:44:37.010 --> 02:44:38.620
I don't think we talk too much anymore.

2689
02:44:38.650 --> 02:44:42.100
I bet that Maghera twins are totally tight.
They seem like different,
right?

2690
02:44:43.290 --> 02:44:46.930
Yeah.
They seem a different,
they don't seem like,
but what do we know?

2691
02:44:47.380 --> 02:44:51.500
It seemed like they bang chicks together.
Drone.
Yeah.

2692
02:44:51.700 --> 02:44:56.700
You wish I could see them now kicking off there a moment up to the Cabana in

2693
02:44:58.241 --> 02:45:02.460
their gies
that's my Guac.
Yeah.

2694
02:45:03.890 --> 02:45:08.360
Oh,
you big nugget.
A little nod.
You tell me you're on that

2695
02:45:10.250 --> 02:45:15.040
same note.
It's one of them nods.
I don't know who it was and I sure,

2696
02:45:16.210 --> 02:45:20.450
so you're a band.
You're on the Boston card.
Yeah.
That's a good card.
Yeah.
Really.

2697
02:45:20.480 --> 02:45:24.790
Tj Dillashaw a fight with him.
I'm not hinting Brown cruise.

2698
02:45:24.791 --> 02:45:28.920
Dominick Cruz had a big,
big,
big,

2699
02:45:29.310 --> 02:45:34.240
huge big fight.
Just crazy for Dominic.
He's fun injuries.
How I,

2700
02:45:34.290 --> 02:45:36.160
how I show up,
Dominic makes to the fight.

2701
02:45:36.161 --> 02:45:38.440
I'm curious to see how that fight goes down until January.

2702
02:45:38.441 --> 02:45:43.230
That's a whole month of training.
A long time and crazy fight.
Holy Shit.

2703
02:45:44.170 --> 02:45:48.580
Fuck people up.
Fight like that.
That it's going to boost,
you know,

2704
02:45:48.600 --> 02:45:51.640
meeting Hannah Brow Art.
The U s really didn't know who he was.
So like,
all right,

2705
02:45:51.641 --> 02:45:54.220
cool.
We know he's a big underdog,
but Dominick Cruz,

2706
02:45:54.221 --> 02:45:57.700
granted he's been out of the limelight.
He's off mother Fucker,
man.
He is.

2707
02:45:57.701 --> 02:46:00.770
And God damn.
How good a Dominick Cruz look in that mirror.

2708
02:46:00.800 --> 02:46:05.380
[inaudible] fight scene came back for Ashley.
Met with Damon.

2709
02:46:05.440 --> 02:46:10.090
He beat the shit and Tj looks sensational in the Borow rematch.

2710
02:46:10.240 --> 02:46:14.210
<v 0>Like God's son you got oh yeah.
Anthony Pettis.
Eddie Alvarez.
Oh,</v>

2711
02:46:14.211 --> 02:46:19.070
Sharon Brown.
Mitre owns a piece of shit.
Boat Herman.

2712
02:46:19.160 --> 02:46:21.620
Oh my gosh.
The main card,
so forth.

2713
02:46:22.090 --> 02:46:27.050
Older Detroit Star.
I love watching Dj Cruickshank.
Holy Shit.

2714
02:46:27.570 --> 02:46:32.540
Chuck Pierce.
Mitch at Patrick coattails fighting Bro.

2715
02:46:32.541 --> 02:46:36.920
That uh,
that Rosa [inaudible] is ridiculous.

2716
02:46:36.921 --> 02:46:40.070
That's a good fight.
Yeah.
Everyone keeps saying it could be a paper view.

2717
02:46:40.071 --> 02:46:44.170
A man is Coronado and Ross Pearson pro.
This is a finite,
yeah,

2718
02:46:45.270 --> 02:46:48.770
no,
this is fun.
One Shit Dude,
are you,

2719
02:46:48.771 --> 02:46:51.410
she was on the undercard Yup.
First fight man.

2720
02:46:51.830 --> 02:46:56.780
And now as he fights them off as a bad mother fucker.
Dude,
dude,

2721
02:46:56.781 --> 02:47:00.270
this is this,
this should be a pay per view card.
That's a great advice.

2722
02:47:00.271 --> 02:47:05.271
Stack Channel Fox or Fox sports one.

2723
02:47:05.991 --> 02:47:09.320
I think this is Fox sports one.
Is it hard

2724
02:47:11.000 --> 02:47:13.910
because they made it a um,
a world title fight.

2725
02:47:13.911 --> 02:47:16.730
So decided to have a really strong undercard to back it.

2726
02:47:17.810 --> 02:47:21.260
That field from Charles.
A motherfucker wasn't supposed to do this fight.

2727
02:47:21.500 --> 02:47:25.010
This was like last minute.
They uh,
not last minute obviously,

2728
02:47:25.011 --> 02:47:29.120
cause it's not until January,
but fairly last minute they asked me to do it.

2729
02:47:29.180 --> 02:47:32.390
Like I wasn't scheduled to do it.
So that means that that's why I can't,

2730
02:47:32.391 --> 02:47:34.870
I'm not even gonna be there for the Williams.
I won't get into Saturday.

2731
02:47:35.360 --> 02:47:38.800
Sunday morning.
They bring in the heavy too.

2732
02:47:39.300 --> 02:47:41.990
He'd be like after a football game or some shit.
Dude,
hop out.

2733
02:47:41.991 --> 02:47:46.991
Dominick Cruz 20 and one son 20 and one who did lose to

2734
02:47:49.430 --> 02:47:51.070
Dominick Cruz.
Lost

2735
02:47:52.890 --> 02:47:57.560
cause call called WC.
WC days.
Yeah.

2736
02:47:57.580 --> 02:48:01.540
And then he beat him.
Corey match Rogan did with that shit.

2737
02:48:01.570 --> 02:48:04.520
That'd be sea sun.
That's a good fight.
It's a fight.

2738
02:48:04.521 --> 02:48:08.000
It's going to be interesting to see who's got like better footwork and movement.

2739
02:48:08.030 --> 02:48:10.880
I would assume Tj is the favorite gaming.
Yes.

2740
02:48:11.360 --> 02:48:14.330
Well it's because he's been an active.
Right.
That's a huge factor.

2741
02:48:15.270 --> 02:48:17.900
I was going to be a great fight.
Damn dollar cruising along titties.

2742
02:48:17.901 --> 02:48:20.590
I can't wait for pedes Alvarez.
I know,
right?

2743
02:48:21.500 --> 02:48:25.010
You guys come into you coming to the show.
You go to Vegas for Mcgregor.

2744
02:48:25.070 --> 02:48:29.240
Conor McGregor.
No,
you're not.
No.
You come to check.
You guys here is on Sunday.

2745
02:48:30.290 --> 02:48:33.200
You're going to be able to make it.
You're going to come back and boom.

2746
02:48:33.201 --> 02:48:35.600
You're not going to get in trouble with the wife or not figured out a way to

2747
02:48:35.610 --> 02:48:38.810
market.
It's going to be nuts.
That'd be fun,
man.

2748
02:48:38.840 --> 02:48:42.790
Danny Happy Cummings.
Yeah.

2749
02:48:43.280 --> 02:48:46.010
And you could also,
if you're not going to be there,
you could watch it on paper,

2750
02:48:46.190 --> 02:48:50.690
like people butoh videos.com/ebi five,
Sunday,

2751
02:48:50.691 --> 02:48:54.860
December 3rd 10.
If you can make it live though.
Go lots.
It's so fun to see live.

2752
02:48:54.920 --> 02:48:57.800
Yeah,
it's crazy.
It's,
it's such a exciting format.

2753
02:48:57.830 --> 02:49:02.360
It like really changes grappling by adding that element of putting them in bad

2754
02:49:02.361 --> 02:49:07.040
positions after it's over.
It's so awesome.
So far people are digging it,
man.

2755
02:49:07.050 --> 02:49:08.190
So far.
First four

2756
02:49:08.310 --> 02:49:11.970
<v 1>shows have just gotten tremendous reviews.
Everyone loves it.
You know,</v>

2757
02:49:11.980 --> 02:49:15.330
it's Kinda hard to have a bad show.
I mean,
it can happen,

2758
02:49:15.331 --> 02:49:19.680
but when you have 16 black belts and it's a tournament and you see it's like UFC

2759
02:49:19.681 --> 02:49:20.514
too,

2760
02:49:21.130 --> 02:49:25.470
you kind of hard to fuck that up with Cummings in there.

2761
02:49:25.740 --> 02:49:27.840
Everyone's fucking worried about his leg locks and he's right.

2762
02:49:27.841 --> 02:49:32.580
They're gonna fucking chainsaws way to the finals probably,
you know,

2763
02:49:32.581 --> 02:49:37.470
but she's got to get through.
He's got to get through a Havi honey.
Uh,
and then,

2764
02:49:37.471 --> 02:49:41.790
uh,
you know,
there's Raphael Domingo's,
he's a Damien Maia,
a prodigy,
uh,

2765
02:49:41.850 --> 02:49:45.280
Ruben Alvarez,
another leg lock.
He's an east coast leg lock.

2766
02:49:45.500 --> 02:49:49.500
He's from Florida with Ambrose fucks people up,
man.

2767
02:49:49.501 --> 02:49:53.860
And then Kim terra cow tariffs brothers in it.
Uh,
Nathan Orchard.
Fuck man.
It's,

2768
02:49:53.910 --> 02:49:54.680
it's gonna be crazy.

2769
02:49:54.680 --> 02:49:58.700

last show.

2773
02:50:09.700 --> 02:50:12.220
Eddie Cummins won it and he got $20,000,

2774
02:50:12.221 --> 02:50:17.221
and that was 145 pound division that that usually doesn't happen at one 45.

2775
02:50:17.531 --> 02:50:22.300
So,
um,
uh,
all the money goes through the winter.
It's winner take all.

2776
02:50:22.540 --> 02:50:26.500
Um,
so we have to do paper view and about a month later,
a month and a half,

2777
02:50:26.501 --> 02:50:29.380
two months later,
I put it on Youtube and let everyone watch it.

2778
02:50:29.480 --> 02:50:34.130

reserved in general admission eight.
Like I said,</v>

you're free that day,

2780
02:50:37.611 --> 02:50:39.200
you really should go and see it live.

2781
02:50:39.460 --> 02:50:42.020
Especially if you're a fan of Jujitsu at all,

2782
02:50:42.170 --> 02:50:46.160
you'll see the most exciting format,
digits,
a wild ass fucking fights.

2783
02:50:46.400 --> 02:50:50.270
And when these fights go to a draw and then they put them in bad positions at

2784
02:50:50.271 --> 02:50:55.100
the end,
it gets fucking nuts.
It's so fun.
It's such a great idea.

2785
02:50:55.220 --> 02:50:58.970
So just smart.
Just try to make it fine.
Trying to make it fun.

2786
