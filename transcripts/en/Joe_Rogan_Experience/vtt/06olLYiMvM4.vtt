WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.833
It's not that tight.

2
00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.500
The Joe Rogan experience

3
00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:12.900
<v 1>my day,
Joe Rogan podcast by night all day.
I'm not sure.</v>

4
00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:16.030
<v 0>Before you talked to somebody as a good idea,
it seems jarring.</v>

5
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:21.200
It seems like all of a sudden like you have to like talk it down so it becomes

6
00:00:21.401 --> 00:00:23.400
like a conversation again because otherwise it's like,
oh,

7
00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:24.970
what the fuck just right.

8
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.870
You are a neuroscientist or a cognitive neuroscientists.

9
00:00:28.871 --> 00:00:33.250
Would that not affect the way your brain?
Absolutely.
Hearing sort of,
you know,

10
00:00:33.251 --> 00:00:36.790
call to actions will change how you then react to things.
Fucks with you,
right?

11
00:00:36.791 --> 00:00:40.750
Yeah,
absolutely.
That's something.
Yup.
Yup.
We were talking a doctor,

12
00:00:40.751 --> 00:00:43.450
Andrew Hill is on the podcast today and uh,

13
00:00:43.451 --> 00:00:46.780
we were talking before the podcast started.
I didn't want to talk to you anymore.

14
00:00:46.781 --> 00:00:49.780
I wanted to get you in here and sit you down because you said something really

15
00:00:49.781 --> 00:00:54.781
fascinating that you take people who may have problems with substances and you

16
00:00:57.221 --> 00:01:02.200
instead of getting them to abstain,
you get them to use them responsibly,

17
00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.620
which is,
yeah.
An alien concept in this day and age.
Yeah.
I mean,

18
00:01:05.621 --> 00:01:09.340
this is not terribly common in substance abuse,
you know,
sort of treatment world.

19
00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.100
There's a few companies that do it and one of them is here in Los Angeles

20
00:01:12.101 --> 00:01:16.270
alternatives and we uh,
we'll take people that,
you know,

21
00:01:16.271 --> 00:01:20.890
might have an issue with alcohol let's say.
And uh,
the only,

22
00:01:20.891 --> 00:01:24.580
only option is not abstinence for our program.
We have moderation options,

23
00:01:24.581 --> 00:01:28.060
control,
do you stock options,
harm reduction.
So someone might come in and say,

24
00:01:28.061 --> 00:01:29.050
you know,
look,
I'm a,

25
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.830
I consider myself an alcoholic but I want to start drinking again.

26
00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:34.540
Or you know,

27
00:01:34.541 --> 00:01:38.010
I'm someone who has been abstinent for a long time and struggles with craving

28
00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.770
struggles with,
you know,
choice and whenever I slipped I slept big.

29
00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.200
Helped me figure out how to not be that guy,

30
00:01:44.201 --> 00:01:46.480
how to use responsibly or to not use.

31
00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.440
So we don't necessarily say you must be a moderate user or you must abstain.

32
00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.440
We ask clients what they want to do and then help them figure out how to get

33
00:01:53.441 --> 00:01:56.800
there.
And for many of them,
they come to us because we do offer a moderation,

34
00:01:56.801 --> 00:02:01.610
moderate alcohol use approach.
That is a,
that seems pretty novel is,

35
00:02:01.611 --> 00:02:04.900
is it,
I mean,
it is pretty novel.
Yeah.
One of our principals,
Dr Mark Kern,

36
00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.940
has been doing addiction work with moderation focus for about 30 years,
uh,
in La.

37
00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.500
And so it's not just,
you know,
the newest thing ever,

38
00:02:11.501 --> 00:02:14.110
but it's newer than Aa of course,
which has been around for,
you know,

39
00:02:14.111 --> 00:02:15.820
pushing a hundred years now.
Yeah.

40
00:02:15.821 --> 00:02:20.620
Aa people seem to think that that's the only way to go.
You have to do the 12,

41
00:02:20.621 --> 00:02:24.280
10 step program.
You have to call everybody you ever wrong.

42
00:02:24.281 --> 00:02:25.900
Do you have to pray to Jesus?

43
00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.880
You have to drink a lot of coffee and smoke cigarettes.
Yeah.
It must be.

44
00:02:30.881 --> 00:02:34.420
It must be.
Yeah.
I mean,
you know,
uh,
the biggest difference,
uh,

45
00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.080
for an alternatives approach or a harm reduction or moderation approach compared

46
00:02:38.081 --> 00:02:42.910
to Aa and in my perspective,
is that a lot of the AI approaches disempowering.

47
00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.010
You must give up control,
you know,
surrender,
surrender.
Um,

48
00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.950
and I think that there's another option out there and that's architecting more

49
00:02:50.951 --> 00:02:53.930
control,
more power.
Let's figure out your cues for overdrinking.

50
00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:55.780
Let's figure out what happens,
you know,

51
00:02:55.781 --> 00:03:00.160
why do you get to five or six or seven drinks,
like what happens on drink?
Um,

52
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.401
you know,

53
00:03:00.401 --> 00:03:04.420
what are the triggers for like going home and automatically driving into that

54
00:03:04.421 --> 00:03:06.430
liquor store parking lot you always pass by.

55
00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.460
So we help people figure out all the different triggers and cues that are

56
00:03:09.461 --> 00:03:14.320
driving they're out of control use and what control use might look like for
them.

57
00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.150
You know,
what sort of appropriate mindful drinking might look like for them.
Um,

58
00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:19.540
and it's,
if it's alcohol,

59
00:03:19.541 --> 00:03:24.160
people spend the first month with us abstaining anyways just to reset tolerance

60
00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:27.730
because uh,
to be good at moderation,
you have to be good at abstinence.

61
00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:32.620
So the goals may not be abstinence always in our alcohol program,

62
00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.070
but everyone takes a month off,
reset their tolerance,
you know,

63
00:03:36.071 --> 00:03:39.650
get some sort of Clearhead,
uh,
it gets their sleep fixed.
Um,

64
00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.480
and we're doing other things besides the alcohol interventions in therapy and

65
00:03:43.481 --> 00:03:47.770
biofeedback and mindfulness and,
and other,
you know,
sort of whole team approach.

66
00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:50.350
But then at the end of that month,
if folks decided they want to,

67
00:03:50.351 --> 00:03:54.550
we go to a bar with them,
sit down,
they order a drink,
we can,

68
00:03:54.551 --> 00:03:57.370
my breathalyzer and they have their first drink and we,
you know,

69
00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:02.290
they get breathalyzed every drink with them.
Um,
not at this,
no,
no.
Uh,
later,

70
00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:06.820
um,
you know,
I don't typically go to the bars with our clients.
Um,
there's,

71
00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.680
there's some legal issues with drinking with them.

72
00:04:08.681 --> 00:04:10.390
Like when we go to a bar with them,

73
00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:14.590
we buy lunch and they buy the alcohol to avoid.
So you can't even buy it.

74
00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:16.930
We don't provide the drugs and alcohol.
Yeah,
of course.

75
00:04:16.931 --> 00:04:20.410
So do they drink by themselves sometimes?
Um,

76
00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.890
a lot of the clients that we work with carry around little breathalyzers and

77
00:04:23.891 --> 00:04:27.970
their pocket that several times a day picking them and ask them to blow and get

78
00:04:27.971 --> 00:04:32.920
a little a camera snapshot and you know,
it is them and a GPS location.

79
00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:34.840
And so we turned them where they are,

80
00:04:34.841 --> 00:04:37.110
who they are and what their blood alcohol is.
And you know,

81
00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.900
unlike most other treatment programs,
if you blow dirty on a breathalyzer,

82
00:04:40.901 --> 00:04:44.320
it's usually like you're out of here.
But that's,
it's like,
oh great.
So you drank,

83
00:04:44.321 --> 00:04:45.154
what was that like?

84
00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.130
I see you got this blood alcohol level and how many drinks does that,

85
00:04:48.131 --> 00:04:51.310
was that too?
Okay,
interesting.
How over what timeframe,
how did that feel?

86
00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:53.800
And we get people to,
in a very structured way,

87
00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:58.440
analyze what alcohol is instead of it being sort of momentum,
uh,
you know,

88
00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:01.460
based behavior.
The,
the,

89
00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:07.080
there's a certain amount of like pull that something has a drawn,

90
00:05:07.851 --> 00:05:12.250
attracted and an energy to something that's forbidden.
Yeah.

91
00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.280
And that,
that is very problematic for people that are addicts.
Yeah.

92
00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:21.340
I've seen it firsthand many times where people just have this overwhelming

93
00:05:21.641 --> 00:05:22.600
desire to do with,

94
00:05:22.601 --> 00:05:27.601
they're not supposed to do almost because it's like the pressure of abstaining.

95
00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:31.380
Yeah.
It's just overwhelming.
It's like that,
that issue.
Oh,

96
00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:35.080
it's always a cloud hovering over them.
Yeah.
Also things that are forbidden,

97
00:05:35.081 --> 00:05:39.220
become attractive and the conversation about them get shut down a little bit

98
00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:40.290
when things get sort of,
you know,

99
00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:44.710
putting these little isolated bullet walks of um,
dangerous and forbidden.

100
00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:46.870
So it's hard to talk about,
you know,

101
00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:51.190
problematic alcohol use if any alcohol use is considered problematic.

102
00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:56.800
Yeah.
It becomes one of those things where everyone,

103
00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:00.950
this very rigid idea of what an alcoholic is supposed to do.

104
00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:06.400
And if you bring up something like what you're proposing or what you actually

105
00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:09.290
not just propose but you enact and treatment,

106
00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:12.650
that's got to receive a lot of criticism.
It does.
And you know,

107
00:06:12.651 --> 00:06:16.640
we get long term sort of 12 step type saying you're going to kill people.

108
00:06:16.641 --> 00:06:19.070
People are going to,
you know,
problems.
The thing is,
you know,

109
00:06:19.071 --> 00:06:22.640
we've done some research in our center and folks self-select abstinent track or

110
00:06:22.641 --> 00:06:27.641
moderation track and the self selection appears to be what drives success,

111
00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:32.150
not which track you're on.
So if people identify their goals,

112
00:06:32.151 --> 00:06:34.970
we help them reach those goals.
But if your only goals are,

113
00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:38.300
or if you only allowable path is you must be abstinent,

114
00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:42.590
then you aren't taught any skills about how to drink a little bit,
you know,

115
00:06:42.591 --> 00:06:46.400
so when people who are on an abstinent only sort of treatment programs have

116
00:06:46.401 --> 00:06:51.280
slips,
they have big slips,
they just say,
okay,
I'm off the track.
Ooh,

117
00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:54.770
let's just pound it back.
There's that.
There's that discounting or you know,

118
00:06:54.771 --> 00:06:56.690
I've screwed up once.
Might as well just go for it.

119
00:06:56.691 --> 00:06:58.650
And there's also the piece about skills we have.

120
00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:02.360
They don't know how to drink two or three or four drinks if all they do is

121
00:07:02.361 --> 00:07:03.194
abstain.

122
00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:08.610
Now the common thought on genetics and addiction is that certain people have

123
00:07:09.771 --> 00:07:14.750
just a predisposition for alcoholism,
for drug addiction.
Is that a fact?
Yeah.

124
00:07:14.751 --> 00:07:19.130
There's a,
I'm an opioid receptor in the brain.
Um,
I forgot to them.

125
00:07:19.131 --> 00:07:22.070
You are the capital one of the opiod receptors in the brain.
Uh,

126
00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:26.960
there's one genetic sort of flavor you can have where alcohol is extra
rewarding,

127
00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:28.690
where it just is,
you know,

128
00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:31.910
you love that sensation and you'll love the feeling a little more than the

129
00:07:31.911 --> 00:07:36.470
average person might.
So,
but is it just that,
is it just they love it more?

130
00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:39.740
Well,
it's,
it's more rewarding and therefore learning is reinforced.
I mean,

131
00:07:39.741 --> 00:07:43.940
rewarding meaning that what you find repetitive or interesting or Yummy.
MMM.

132
00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:45.680
If you find things extra yummy,

133
00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:50.180
then your behavior is modified to get more of that thing,
you know?

134
00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:54.320
Right.
But the way I've always thought of it,

135
00:07:54.321 --> 00:07:58.820
I don't have a genetic predisposition to alcoholism and I've had friends who do,

136
00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:02.000
and there's this weird thing that happens.
So then when you see them drink,

137
00:08:02.001 --> 00:08:05.630
where they,
they go,
juror belies,
you know,
where they're like,
no one's there.

138
00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:08.300
They're sharp guys.
Yeah.
You know what I mean?
Are you looking at it?
You're like,

139
00:08:08.301 --> 00:08:10.610
where are you man?
Are you in there like get,

140
00:08:10.611 --> 00:08:13.820
you literally don't see them anymore?
Well,
these folks are probably,
you know,

141
00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:17.420
thoroughly into a hardcore drinking,
you know,
lifestyle,
right?

142
00:08:17.421 --> 00:08:21.980
This is not their first big slipping a long time.
This is sort of uh,
uh,
you know,

143
00:08:21.981 --> 00:08:24.800
go to the bar after work every day or go to the liquor store and grab a half

144
00:08:24.801 --> 00:08:29.560
bottle of wine every day.
This is,
you know,
reinforced to behavior.
Um,

145
00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:33.110
I don't think even someone with those genes would have sort of a checkout or

146
00:08:33.111 --> 00:08:35.780
some,
you know,
lack of sudden self control,

147
00:08:36.410 --> 00:08:39.500
their first drink after I've standing for awhile.
It's the,

148
00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:44.530
the behavioral sort of slippery slope that we get on that causes the problem and

149
00:08:44.531 --> 00:08:48.420
folks that have this extra rewarding effect from alcohol,
you know,

150
00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:52.220
get pulled down that slip faster,
but it's still not,
you know,

151
00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:56.100
predetermined.
You're not going to become an alcoholic just

152
00:08:56.100 --> 00:09:00.510
<v 2>because you have a more rewarding effect from alcohol or something else.
See,</v>

153
00:09:00.511 --> 00:09:04.020
I was always confused.
I didn't think that it was a reward issue.
All right.

154
00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:08.080
I thought,
and this is based entirely on,
you know,
just talking to people.

155
00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:09.510
So no research obviously,

156
00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:14.100
but I always thought it was just something happens to them where they cannot

157
00:09:14.101 --> 00:09:15.960
help themselves.
That's,

158
00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:21.020
is that just the common way of discussing it because of the 12 step treatment

159
00:09:22.081 --> 00:09:25.470
program?
Ideal?
Yeah.
I think partially there's this idea of,
well,

160
00:09:25.471 --> 00:09:27.990
you're powerless over alcohol,
therefore,
except that you're powerless.

161
00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:33.240
But a lot of that powerlessness or I can't control my behavior is because of the

162
00:09:33.241 --> 00:09:36.390
sort of overlearning that comes where behavior is no longer a choice.

163
00:09:36.391 --> 00:09:40.500
It's almost automatic because you've gotten so rewarded so many times from that

164
00:09:40.501 --> 00:09:44.970
behavior that then the behavior becomes reinforced.
I mean,
I,
you know,
it all,

165
00:09:44.971 --> 00:09:47.190
addiction is this way,
but all addiction is just learning.

166
00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:50.310
It's not some special form of learning.
It's just learning.

167
00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:53.670
So what you're talking about is people that have learned to lose control.

168
00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:56.460
So there's that.

169
00:09:56.461 --> 00:10:01.380
Like there's the common myths thought about native Americans.

170
00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:03.250
The common,
um,
uh,

171
00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:07.080
discussion when people talk about native Americans and alcohol is that they

172
00:10:07.081 --> 00:10:08.880
didn't have alcohol in their diet.

173
00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:12.120
We introduced it to them with the Europeans restaurant,
introduced it to them,

174
00:10:12.121 --> 00:10:14.850
and then they became almost instantly addicted because they did not have the

175
00:10:14.851 --> 00:10:17.960
genetic predisposition to process it.
Yeah.
And that's,
yes,

176
00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:21.150
I think it's partially bs.
I think it's more about,
you know,

177
00:10:21.151 --> 00:10:26.151
if you lock a bunch of people on a small plot of a non farmable land and don't

178
00:10:26.851 --> 00:10:29.940
get them any mechanisms for advancement and take away all their power and then

179
00:10:29.941 --> 00:10:32.820
give them the drug to abuse,
they abuse it.
You know,

180
00:10:32.821 --> 00:10:37.020
there's all these studies showing that if you give a a rat unfettered access to

181
00:10:37.021 --> 00:10:41.100
drugs and alcohol,
it sits there and you know,
it's the lever until it dies,
right?

182
00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:42.870
That's actually not true.

183
00:10:42.871 --> 00:10:46.110
If you give a rat access to cocaine or alcohol dependent alcohol,

184
00:10:46.111 --> 00:10:50.700
but something really rewarding,
um,
it will only self administer the drug in the,

185
00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:51.570
you know,
and,

186
00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:55.530
and sort of starve to death for the reward when the environment is an

187
00:10:55.531 --> 00:10:59.100
interesting,
when the environment's impoverished,
if there's lots of,
you know,

188
00:10:59.101 --> 00:11:01.920
wrap toys and lots of other acute rats hanging out,

189
00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:05.640
they're much less interested in becoming an cocaine addicts or whatever it is.

190
00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:08.310
Um,
it's only in the absence of stimulating,

191
00:11:08.311 --> 00:11:11.430
enriched environments do these sort of automatic behaviors takeover.

192
00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:15.240
So I would argue at least partially the native American alcohol connection is

193
00:11:15.241 --> 00:11:20.010
because these are decent people who are disenfranchised systematically and then

194
00:11:20.011 --> 00:11:21.880
given an escape.
You know,

195
00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:25.170
I had that discussion recently with Dr Chris Ryan and one of the things,

196
00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:28.560
he's the author of sex at dawn,
very interesting book,

197
00:11:28.561 --> 00:11:32.250
but one of the things that he brought up is the environment itself that they do

198
00:11:32.251 --> 00:11:34.470
these studies on rats.
They're in a cage,

199
00:11:34.770 --> 00:11:38.080
they're in a case is for lesson lights and there's people in lab coats or

200
00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:41.500
hovering over them.
Right.
It's about is unnatural as you can get.
Yup.

201
00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:46.260
And any escape that they could probably seek,
you know,
to,
to,
to try exactly.

202
00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:48.600
Mitigate the stress that they're under.
I mean,

203
00:11:48.601 --> 00:11:50.250
it's a completely unnatural environment.

204
00:11:50.251 --> 00:11:52.910
It's not like you're giving them cocaine out in the wild.
Right.

205
00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:54.010
If you did exactly that,
they

206
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:57.250
<v 0>probably,
they probably wouldn't go after it.
Yeah.
I mean,
um,</v>

207
00:11:57.490 --> 00:11:58.990
if you put some toys in their cage,

208
00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:02.560
they stopped self administering to the same degree.
There's not as interested in,

209
00:12:02.561 --> 00:12:05.410
I mean,
addiction is not the goal.
The reward isn't necessarily the goal.

210
00:12:05.411 --> 00:12:09.610
When things are interesting novel,
when you can explore your environments,
right?

211
00:12:09.611 --> 00:12:13.000
So their brains are programmed to seek out food,

212
00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:15.700
to seek out sex and to seek out shelter.

213
00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:18.490
And when all those things are screwed up because they're in this completely

214
00:12:18.491 --> 00:12:21.580
unnatural environment,
they don't know what to do.
Yeah,
exactly.
I mean,
and,

215
00:12:21.581 --> 00:12:24.280
and this,
this is not just rats and humans were given this.
Well,

216
00:12:24.281 --> 00:12:27.130
if you're an alcoholic,
if you're a drinker,
a problem drinker,

217
00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:30.010
you're always going to be a problem.
Drinker is the prevailing wisdom,

218
00:12:30.190 --> 00:12:32.230
which also isn't true.
Something like 90,

219
00:12:32.231 --> 00:12:37.231
95% of people that are problem drinkers learn to not be problem drinkers with no

220
00:12:37.811 --> 00:12:40.690
programs,
with no intervention,
no therapy.

221
00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:44.350
It's learn to get control over their drinking.
Do you think that that,

222
00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:46.900
that's a really interesting point.

223
00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:49.440
It's a really interesting point when you think about,
um,

224
00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:54.220
people that look forward to happy hour and we look forward to that drink after

225
00:12:54.221 --> 00:12:58.690
work.
Like how many boring jobs we've turned people into alcoholics because yeah,

226
00:12:58.750 --> 00:13:00.010
while they're at work all day,

227
00:13:00.011 --> 00:13:05.011
they're just constantly itching away at their natural reward systems.

228
00:13:05.381 --> 00:13:08.520
Just God,
something,
I got to get something in here.
Exactly.
Yeah.

229
00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:12.850
And boredom and lack of ability to tolerate boredom or tolerate uncomfortable

230
00:13:12.851 --> 00:13:13.810
emotions of which,
you know,

231
00:13:13.811 --> 00:13:18.100
boredom can be one is often the biggest driver for problematic substance use.

232
00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:21.810
Wow.
Boredom,
boredom or marriage.

233
00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:25.060
That's why dudes get drunk when they're married.
Well,

234
00:13:25.061 --> 00:13:28.900
it's probably one of the reasons it's a big one,
right?
Yeah.
That is amazing that,

235
00:13:28.901 --> 00:13:29.171
you know,

236
00:13:29.171 --> 00:13:34.171
and it's that that story has always been that story of the tests with the rats

237
00:13:34.781 --> 00:13:38.710
and the cocaine has been just sort of repeated ad nauseum.
Sure.

238
00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:40.210
Does the point where everybody repeats it.

239
00:13:40.211 --> 00:13:44.170
And until Chris Ryan brought it up that way,
I,
I,
I never really thought about it.

240
00:13:44.171 --> 00:13:46.090
I just thought,
wow.
Cocaine's a super addictive.

241
00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:49.470
And then he brought it up that way.
I'm like,
Oh yeah,
we have,
we got,

242
00:13:49.471 --> 00:13:54.400
of course they're in a fucking cage.
Right.
They're all stressed out.
Freaked out.

243
00:13:54.401 --> 00:13:57.010
No wonder whether doing blow.
Yeah,
exactly.
Right.
And you know,

244
00:13:57.011 --> 00:14:01.030
and things like cocaine,
math,
the psycho stimulant class of drugs,
um,

245
00:14:01.090 --> 00:14:03.850
they affect a neurotransmitter or primarily called dopamine.

246
00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:06.640
And dopamine is the reward signal.

247
00:14:06.641 --> 00:14:09.700
It's the interest salients appetitive you know,
when you see a hot girl,

248
00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:12.370
you get dope me and bump.
When you eat an ice cream sandwich,

249
00:14:12.371 --> 00:14:14.230
you got dopamine bump.
When you do a line of blow,

250
00:14:14.410 --> 00:14:17.800
you get a dopamine bump and a second one from the direct,
you know,

251
00:14:17.801 --> 00:14:20.020
cocaine affecting the dopamine system.

252
00:14:20.290 --> 00:14:24.700
So the stimulant class is sort of so addictive because it's pleasurable and

253
00:14:24.701 --> 00:14:28.660
because it directly modifies the dopamine and sort of system.
So you get a one,

254
00:14:28.661 --> 00:14:31.210
two,
I was a double a reward if you will.

255
00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:36.100
And do you apply the same sort of treatment protocol with cocaine that you do

256
00:14:36.101 --> 00:14:40.000
with alcohol?
Don't know.
Um,
you know,
there's a bunch of reasons why a,

257
00:14:40.001 --> 00:14:43.600
for things that are sort of drugs of abuse,
like cocaine,
meth,
you know,

258
00:14:43.690 --> 00:14:47.920
we would probably ask folks to abstain or encourage them to,

259
00:14:48.130 --> 00:14:50.470
but there's some other drugs you can abstain from.
You know,

260
00:14:50.471 --> 00:14:53.060
someone's on like drugs for pain,
medication,

261
00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:57.960
a pain management or psychiatric drugs they need to take for whatever reason.
Um,

262
00:14:58.010 --> 00:15:00.800
we would do it more a harm reduction approach for drugs,

263
00:15:01.190 --> 00:15:03.680
prescribed drugs that have become a drugs abuse,

264
00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:08.080
but for recreational drugs of abuse,
like cocaine,
um,
you know,
there's,

265
00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:12.890
there's legal and ethical issues with offering a moderate cocaine is,

266
00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:16.610
well,
what if cocaine was legal then we would then you would like,
can,

267
00:15:16.611 --> 00:15:19.880
it's only on a bus for instance,
is sort of right on that edge of,
uh,
you know,

268
00:15:19.881 --> 00:15:20.840
being legal or not.

269
00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:25.840
And we would offer a cannabis moderation if someone was legally using cannabis,

270
00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:29.840
you know?
Um,
and if we were in Colorado or Washington state,

271
00:15:29.841 --> 00:15:33.410
we'd be offering cannabis as an equal moderate player,
so to speak,

272
00:15:33.411 --> 00:15:34.370
with our alcohol program.

273
00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:39.090
<v 2>What does that concern you that the only reason why you don't use cocaine and</v>

274
00:15:39.091 --> 00:15:40.190
that way is that

275
00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:41.860
<v 0>it's illegal?
Well,
I mean,</v>

276
00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:46.810
I think a lot of people can get in trouble with cocaine,
um,

277
00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:49.550
in a way they aren't going to get in trouble with weed.

278
00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:54.800
So I think the bar for risk versus harm versus,
you know what we're,

279
00:15:54.830 --> 00:15:57.190
we're uh,
potentially the,
the,

280
00:15:57.191 --> 00:16:00.410
the cost of failure is much higher for some of these heavier drugs.

281
00:16:00.950 --> 00:16:03.560
So we're never going to offer like a heroin moderation program,

282
00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:07.370
but he's an alcohol equally bad for you.

283
00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:11.840
When you look at statistics of abuse and the health consequences,

284
00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:14.300
alcohol seems to rank right up there with heroin.

285
00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:18.290
There are more alcohol abusers as that what it is then there are heroin abusers

286
00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:22.240
and people don't,
don't abuse heroin from like an age 12 to age 80.
Right.

287
00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:23.570
At high levels.
I mean we,

288
00:16:23.571 --> 00:16:27.980
people can have used alcohol their whole lives at high level and survive and

289
00:16:27.981 --> 00:16:29.780
survive somehow or you know,
manage,

290
00:16:29.781 --> 00:16:33.740
that's not going to be the case with cocaine or heroin or major opiates or

291
00:16:33.741 --> 00:16:34.150
stimuli.

292
00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:37.930
<v 2>Now when you talk about opiates of course in this country and today you,</v>

293
00:16:37.931 --> 00:16:42.931
you consider pills cause this is the new form of distribution.

294
00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:46.840
Have you ever seen that?
Um,
the documentary,
um,
uh,

295
00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:49.360
the oxycontin express,
I have not.

296
00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:55.020
It is a really fascinating piece that they did and it actually helped alter the

297
00:16:55.151 --> 00:16:57.460
law in Florida because Florida has to have those.

298
00:16:57.510 --> 00:16:59.300
You're aware of the whole situation in Florida.

299
00:16:59.301 --> 00:17:03.010
I'm sure they had pain management centers for folks who don't know and these

300
00:17:03.011 --> 00:17:06.460
pains,
pain management centers were essentially one stop heroin shops.
Yeah,

301
00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:08.470
they'd give it to you in pill form,
but you would go there.

302
00:17:08.471 --> 00:17:12.000
There would be a doctor right there and he'd say,
hey doctor,

303
00:17:12.030 --> 00:17:14.260
my back's all fucked up.
All right,
well you need pain pills.

304
00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:16.270
And then you would go,
literally,

305
00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:20.380
you would exit his door and go to the next door and that was run by the same

306
00:17:20.381 --> 00:17:23.860
company and it was a pain management facility,
pharmacy.

307
00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:27.820
And he'd go in there and all they had was pills and you would just go and buy

308
00:17:27.821 --> 00:17:30.610
oxycontin's and there was all these people waiting outside.

309
00:17:30.611 --> 00:17:34.060
Vanguard did the show,
uh,
on it and a,
it was amazing.

310
00:17:34.061 --> 00:17:37.180
It was amazing because they followed people who are hooked on it.

311
00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:41.350
They followed people that were going hopping from clinic to clinic and it was

312
00:17:41.351 --> 00:17:42.520
just rampant.

313
00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:47.760
Florida had some ungodly percentage of people that were prescribed a oxycontin.

314
00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:50.370
Yeah,
of course.
Elders

315
00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:51.540
<v 0>are also mean.
Florida.</v>

316
00:17:51.541 --> 00:17:56.541
Half the state is elders and pain management is much more common.

317
00:17:57.331 --> 00:18:01.680
Painted pediment in the medical sort of space as much more common when you're 78

318
00:18:01.681 --> 00:18:03.390
years old and it is when you're 30 or 40,

319
00:18:03.391 --> 00:18:07.860
it's very important when you say elders at you say age and not Mormons.
Yes.
Yes.

320
00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:12.080
Um,
uh,
not the,
not,
not the quorum of 12,
whatever.
No.
Uh,
like,

321
00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:14.730
like people 60,
65 and up is what I consider elders.

322
00:18:14.810 --> 00:18:17.910
I have some friends that are Mormon and w we were over their house and some

323
00:18:17.911 --> 00:18:21.600
elders came over and they were in their twenties.
Yeah.
There,
there,
there,

324
00:18:21.601 --> 00:18:25.590
this is elder John and this is the elder Wilson.
Like get the fuck out of here.

325
00:18:25.591 --> 00:18:28.920
I'm not calling you elder.
Yeah.
I have a buddy who's a,
it was a Jack Mormon,

326
00:18:28.921 --> 00:18:31.980
you know,
a lapsed Mormon and uh,
he's just,
you know,

327
00:18:31.981 --> 00:18:35.000
55 year old guy with dreadlocks down to his ankles and you know,

328
00:18:35.130 --> 00:18:39.120
musician and he left the Mormon Church but he was an elder and he's like early

329
00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:42.480
twenties,
before he sort of decided it wasn't for him.
Yeah.

330
00:18:42.481 --> 00:18:46.320
He could have used some heroin.
Yeah.
Got Him off that early maybe.
Um,

331
00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:51.350
so you think that if more people had heroin you would see health consequences,

332
00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:57.000
um,
of far worse than what they are of alcohol?
I do,
yeah.
I think,

333
00:18:57.120 --> 00:19:00.660
I think it'd be hard for people to abuse high levels of opiates without their

334
00:19:00.661 --> 00:19:03.420
life falling apart very quickly.
And this is true,

335
00:19:03.421 --> 00:19:06.780
mean some people get into alcohol and go downhill very fast.

336
00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:09.420
Other people get into alcohol and never have a problem with it.

337
00:19:09.450 --> 00:19:10.710
Even drinking high levels.

338
00:19:10.890 --> 00:19:15.000
Well what concerns me about those pills more than anything else is I've had

339
00:19:15.001 --> 00:19:16.890
friends that don't have problems with anything else.

340
00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:20.440
And they got on pain pills and then uhmm including a,

341
00:19:20.530 --> 00:19:24.300
there's a family member that I have just got,
got injured at work,

342
00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:28.740
got on pills for his back and then gone.
Really Common Story.

343
00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:32.210
It's bizarre.
It's like something steels who they are.
Yeah.

344
00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:34.540
Once you're addicted to pain medication,
you know,

345
00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:36.000
the doctors won't give it to you forever.

346
00:19:36.001 --> 00:19:38.790
So at some point you're getting off the pain medication prescriptions,

347
00:19:38.791 --> 00:19:41.810
but you might still be addicted.
So you seek,
you know,

348
00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:44.910
street opiates and that's where they showed the standard story there.

349
00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:48.570
So there's an itch that they can't scratch anymore and it just becomes

350
00:19:48.571 --> 00:19:52.500
overwhelming after awhile.
Yeah,
exactly.
There's a lot of that.
The same thing,

351
00:19:52.501 --> 00:19:56.190
sort of this psychological pull of something that's forbidden or something that

352
00:19:56.191 --> 00:19:59.700
you're not supposed to do or is there is a physical component too.

353
00:19:59.710 --> 00:20:04.320
There's definitely a physical component,
uh,
to addictions.
Um,
but you know,

354
00:20:04.321 --> 00:20:07.680
the withdrawal symptoms and the,
I mean,
addiction is really two things.

355
00:20:07.681 --> 00:20:12.681
It's dependence and tolerance and the tolerance you can get for some drugs very

356
00:20:13.291 --> 00:20:17.610
quickly.
The dependence might not show up the same way for everybody.
Um,

357
00:20:17.670 --> 00:20:22.670
but other folks may have dependence and withdrawal symptoms from low amounts.

358
00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:27.570
Heroin is fairly addicting.
The withdrawal from heroin is brutal.

359
00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:32.880
I believe the physiological addiction of nicotine might be greater than heroin,

360
00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:37.440
but the withdrawals not as bad.
So the physical withdrawal,

361
00:20:37.441 --> 00:20:42.360
the actual bid aches of your body.
Yeah.
Carl Hart described Dr Crawl Heart.

362
00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:46.110
Um,
I forget the name of his book,
but he's been on the podcast before.

363
00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:49.980
You remember his book?
Jamie,
doesn't matter.
It's an important,
um,

364
00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:54.590
he said it was like having a bad flu.
He said,
yeah,

365
00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:59.940
he said it's very overrated as far as the amount of pain you go through.

366
00:21:00.011 --> 00:21:04.660
The flu kind of sucks.
It does kind of suck,
but everyone looks at it as if like,

367
00:21:04.661 --> 00:21:09.490
it's this horrible bone aching.
Like I've never done oxycontin,

368
00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:12.690
so I don't,
I don't know.
I've never done heroin,
so I,
I,

369
00:21:12.730 --> 00:21:16.840
I'm just guessing we'll think about what the opiate system does endogenously

370
00:21:16.841 --> 00:21:20.260
naturally in your body.
It helps you not feel pain.

371
00:21:20.290 --> 00:21:22.120
It helps reduce pain and inflammation.

372
00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:27.460
So if you've been abusing with super physiological levels,
massive opiates,

373
00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:32.650
and then you withdraw them,
you're a pain reduction system is overly sort of,

374
00:21:32.670 --> 00:21:32.980
you know,

375
00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:37.960
sensitized and then you feel things as painful that were not considered painful

376
00:21:37.961 --> 00:21:42.040
before.
So I think that a lot of that withdrawal is sort of resetting the opiate,

377
00:21:42.130 --> 00:21:45.700
the endogenous pain management system.
Interesting.

378
00:21:45.701 --> 00:21:49.450
So there's probably all sorts of weird little aches and pains that you are

379
00:21:49.451 --> 00:21:51.790
already have that you're just completely unaware of.

380
00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.280
And then they glaringly become obvious,

381
00:21:54.281 --> 00:21:56.260
which is what happens when you get the flu.
And you know,

382
00:21:56.261 --> 00:21:58.630
if you worked out the day before you feel like crap,
you know,

383
00:21:58.631 --> 00:22:02.920
muscles or extra achy because now there's inflammation and you know,
spasms.

384
00:22:03.050 --> 00:22:05.890
And I think all that probably happens too when you're withdrawing from massive

385
00:22:05.891 --> 00:22:06.640
opiates.

386
00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:11.640
Now when you get a guy like a rush limbo who famously was taking something like

387
00:22:11.710 --> 00:22:15.760
90 pills a day,
something insane,
I don't remember what the number was,

388
00:22:15.761 --> 00:22:20.761
but it was off the charts where he had his housekeeper would go out and buy him

389
00:22:20.981 --> 00:22:25.810
the stuff.
And how does that happen?
Like how does one keep ramping it up?
Well,

390
00:22:25.811 --> 00:22:27.370
I mean I think you have to be resourceful.

391
00:22:27.371 --> 00:22:28.750
And I think you mentioned earlier where people,
you know,

392
00:22:28.751 --> 00:22:30.340
clinic hopping or doctor hopping,

393
00:22:30.341 --> 00:22:33.760
I mean that's a really common sort of way people abuse,
uh,

394
00:22:33.790 --> 00:22:38.470
pain meds is to get multiple people to prescribe.
Um,
it sounds like,

395
00:22:38.471 --> 00:22:41.800
you know,
rush may have had his friends and family,
you know,

396
00:22:41.801 --> 00:22:44.570
helping to develop his habit.
Um,

397
00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:47.380
when you're taking lots of different things though,

398
00:22:47.381 --> 00:22:50.770
there's an added risk and that's what's called polypharmacy or interactions

399
00:22:50.771 --> 00:22:53.440
between your drugs and a lot of painkillers.

400
00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:57.700
A lot of major tranquilizers are very significant drugs that suppress the

401
00:22:57.701 --> 00:23:00.040
cardiovascular system,
the respiratory system.

402
00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:03.640
And so if you combine different types of drugs being given from different

403
00:23:03.641 --> 00:23:06.970
doctors who aren't aware of the different drugs that you're being given,

404
00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:10.570
then you can get into,
you know,
life threatening side effects very quickly.

405
00:23:10.571 --> 00:23:11.404
For some people.

406
00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:15.940
That was the big issue in Florida was that they didn't have a database of until

407
00:23:15.941 --> 00:23:18.820
recently.
So you could go to one doctor,

408
00:23:18.821 --> 00:23:21.520
get your prescription and go right down the street to another doctor and they

409
00:23:21.521 --> 00:23:23.920
couldn't share information.
So you'd never know,
hey,

410
00:23:23.921 --> 00:23:25.300
this guy already has prescription.

411
00:23:25.301 --> 00:23:28.510
He's going crazy and he's getting pills all over town.
Yeah.
And you know,

412
00:23:28.511 --> 00:23:32.550
to some extent those little pharmacy slash prescription shops,
uh,
they,

413
00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:34.830
they remind me of,
you know,
the,
the,
uh,

414
00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:38.400
cannabis culture we have in most states now where,
you know,

415
00:23:38.401 --> 00:23:42.160
you can walk in to a little mom and pop sort of prescription center where you,

416
00:23:42.161 --> 00:23:44.680
maybe you see a doctor,
maybe you see their nurse practitioner,

417
00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:46.990
you pay your 40 bucks,
he walk out with a car,

418
00:23:46.991 --> 00:23:49.730
do you go next door and you put your card down and walk out with your weed.

419
00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:52.400
You know,
nowadays you go online and you say,

420
00:23:52.401 --> 00:23:54.650
I'd like this strain delivered at my door at this time,

421
00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:57.620
and it shows up at your door with a smile and a little mint.

422
00:23:59.030 --> 00:24:03.410
It's a very different sort of way to deal with drugs.

423
00:24:03.411 --> 00:24:07.880
Then the gatekeeper of the physician who's carefully paying attention to your

424
00:24:07.881 --> 00:24:11.120
full use spectrum and managing your life,

425
00:24:11.121 --> 00:24:15.290
managing your health with some good perspective on you.
When we have these,

426
00:24:15.291 --> 00:24:15.530
you know,

427
00:24:15.530 --> 00:24:18.560
as you mentioned that in the short time we have 10 minutes with the doctor or

428
00:24:18.561 --> 00:24:21.200
something and it's a prescription out the door.
Yeah,
the will.

429
00:24:21.201 --> 00:24:24.890
The cannabis one is kind of a joke because although there are people,

430
00:24:24.891 --> 00:24:27.170
I'm going to know people that use it for health reasons,

431
00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:31.040
the vast majority are Juke in the system.
They're just like,
hey,

432
00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.420
I got a headache.
Free Pot stress.

433
00:24:35.450 --> 00:24:39.980
Stress is one of the biggest detriments to health.
You know,
cortisol rises,

434
00:24:39.981 --> 00:24:44.450
your hippocampus dies and cells fall apart and your body heals less fast and you

435
00:24:44.451 --> 00:24:49.010
learn less.
Well,
your frontal lobe shuts down.
Stress is a big problem.
So,

436
00:24:49.390 --> 00:24:49.640
you know,

437
00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:53.240
I would argue that even the recreational cannabis users who sort of gamed the

438
00:24:53.241 --> 00:24:57.050
system are getting the stress reduction benefits from it typically.
Oh No,

439
00:24:57.051 --> 00:24:58.580
I would agree with you most certainly.

440
00:24:58.581 --> 00:25:02.150
I also think that life itself is a disease.

441
00:25:02.510 --> 00:25:06.020
You need a drug to treat life itself.
Yeah,
maybe a desirable difficulty.

442
00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:07.670
It's just ridiculous.
Well the,
the,

443
00:25:07.671 --> 00:25:12.320
the pressures of the average nine to five existence plus traffic commute,

444
00:25:12.321 --> 00:25:15.450
Bill's family is an overwhelming,
I don't,

445
00:25:15.451 --> 00:25:17.990
I don't believe that our bodies are designed for this.

446
00:25:18.230 --> 00:25:23.230
And I think that any means that you can without completely destroying your body

447
00:25:23.870 --> 00:25:27.590
and mitigating whatever pressures and stresses you're under.
I'm all for it.

448
00:25:27.590 --> 00:25:30.000
I mean I think aspirin should be legal.
I,
I'm,

449
00:25:30.010 --> 00:25:32.540
I'm a big fan of almost everything being legal,

450
00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:37.630
but I think that some folks are going to have a much harder time with certain

451
00:25:38.391 --> 00:25:41.810
substances than others.
Yeah.
And that's individual variability is part of it.

452
00:25:41.811 --> 00:25:44.780
You know,
the genetics your show up with.
It's also things like your,

453
00:25:44.781 --> 00:25:49.100
your environment.
You know,
what you see used,
how you use,
why you use,

454
00:25:49.270 --> 00:25:52.580
you are using because you want to feel comfortable or euphoric or have some good

455
00:25:52.581 --> 00:25:56.020
time or watch a movie and find it extra interesting.
Are using a shutdown,

456
00:25:56.030 --> 00:25:59.600
the pain and boredom of your life cause they're very dramatically different ways

457
00:25:59.601 --> 00:26:04.430
of using substances.
And are you using it to mitigate the effects of trauma,

458
00:26:04.490 --> 00:26:06.530
especially trauma from your childhood,

459
00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:11.560
which is one of the things that people don't consider when they talk in

460
00:26:11.901 --> 00:26:14.960
disparaging ways about people being addicts.

461
00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:19.460
They don't consider the fact that this person might have been wired in a certain

462
00:26:19.461 --> 00:26:22.820
way because of traumatic experiences that they had while they're developing

463
00:26:22.821 --> 00:26:26.090
where their mine was developing.
I see that all the tons represent that.
Yeah.

464
00:26:26.091 --> 00:26:26.370
I mean I,

465
00:26:26.370 --> 00:26:30.170
I do brain mapping qbeg and we look at sort of functional patterns in brains and

466
00:26:30.171 --> 00:26:32.900
try to tie it together to people's behavior and the things that are struggling

467
00:26:32.901 --> 00:26:36.080
with.
And I often see in people that are struggling with alcohol,

468
00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:37.460
sort of a sensitization,

469
00:26:37.461 --> 00:26:41.390
a hot spot on the back of the brain in an area called the posterior cingulate

470
00:26:41.391 --> 00:26:42.224
Cortex,

471
00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:46.260
which is to some extent involved with psych sensitization to threat noticing

472
00:26:46.261 --> 00:26:48.230
danger and these that,
that,
that,

473
00:26:48.290 --> 00:26:52.530
that spot shows up that overactivity shows up when people have experienced

474
00:26:52.590 --> 00:26:55.230
fairly significant trauma.
Um,

475
00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:58.110
so it's a pretty common reason people are using drugs and alcohol.

476
00:26:58.160 --> 00:26:59.670
And is there a way to mitigate that?

477
00:26:59.671 --> 00:27:03.330
Is there a way to diminish the effects of Oh sure.
Yeah,
there's multiple ways.

478
00:27:03.331 --> 00:27:07.680
It's a short answer.
Um,
I do a lot of neurofeedback or biofeedback on brainwaves,

479
00:27:07.890 --> 00:27:11.610
so you might measure that like excess Beta excess fast activity back there.

480
00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:14.940
It's not a stuck level.
It's,
it's always fluctuating moment to moment.

481
00:27:14.941 --> 00:27:17.730
And so whatever it trends in the right direction goes down.

482
00:27:18.150 --> 00:27:19.020
You make something happen,

483
00:27:19.021 --> 00:27:22.230
make a chime play or a spaceship fly or a pack meet some dots,

484
00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:24.510
but it fluctuates in the wrong direction.

485
00:27:24.511 --> 00:27:27.780
A minute later in the PAC man stops and then the brain fluctuates in the right

486
00:27:27.781 --> 00:27:31.280
direction.
The pacman continues,
the brain starts to go,
oh cool input.

487
00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:35.310
Whenever I'm doing one thing and it does more of that one thing and this trains

488
00:27:35.311 --> 00:27:39.450
down or trains up certain patterns in the brain to change regulatory modes.

489
00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:42.990
Wow.
So what's the mechanism of this?

490
00:27:42.991 --> 00:27:47.040
Like what's causing this?
Yeah,
well it's basic learning.

491
00:27:47.041 --> 00:27:50.250
I mean when you were a baby flopping around and trying to learn how to walk,

492
00:27:50.580 --> 00:27:54.750
there was a lot of random activity making your limbs move or semi random,

493
00:27:54.751 --> 00:27:56.910
you know,
just trying random,
your brain was just gonna say it,

494
00:27:56.911 --> 00:27:58.650
random pulses to see what happened.

495
00:27:58.950 --> 00:28:01.620
And suddenly you put your arms down on the ground,

496
00:28:01.621 --> 00:28:03.120
you push yourself up and you could see more.

497
00:28:03.121 --> 00:28:06.360
You could see further into the distance.
Your brain went,
oh cool.

498
00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:11.100
Remember this pattern of muscle activity?
Because this one gets me to,
you know,

499
00:28:11.101 --> 00:28:15.600
see more stuff and explore the environment.
And it wasn't like some magical,

500
00:28:15.601 --> 00:28:19.800
your brain went okay,
you know,
contract,
the left bicep and then the left forearm.

501
00:28:20.010 --> 00:28:23.430
It just kind of happens randomly until it produces the desired effect,
which is,

502
00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:25.080
oh,
I'm sort of crawling now.

503
00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:30.000
And then the brain does more of the thing that let it get more input,
you know,

504
00:28:30.001 --> 00:28:31.950
avoid danger,
get pleasure,
whatever the,
you know,

505
00:28:31.951 --> 00:28:35.070
learning reinforcers are the same thing happens when you're sitting in front of

506
00:28:35.071 --> 00:28:36.240
a biofeedback machine.

507
00:28:36.430 --> 00:28:40.980
Try and make a spaceship fly or a car race around a track with your brain.
Um,

508
00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:43.320
you want it to happen.
And so whenever the car,
you know,

509
00:28:43.321 --> 00:28:46.380
slows down and Peter's out next to the race course cause your brain got

510
00:28:46.381 --> 00:28:47.790
distracted or tents,

511
00:28:48.150 --> 00:28:51.330
the brain doesn't like the lack of input and it starts to go,
hey wait,

512
00:28:51.331 --> 00:28:55.170
where's my,
where's my input?
And it tries to figure out,
oh,

513
00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:57.540
I'm controlling this environment out in the world,

514
00:28:57.541 --> 00:29:00.720
therefore I should do more of x,
less of y.
It's,
it's a,

515
00:29:00.721 --> 00:29:04.620
it's actually a noncognitive process.
Believe it or not.
You weren't trying,

516
00:29:04.621 --> 00:29:08.220
you're more sort of letting it happen.
We're instrumentally or shaping,

517
00:29:08.221 --> 00:29:11.280
conditioning the brain in certain directions and there are there certain

518
00:29:11.281 --> 00:29:15.090
triggers that could potentially bring you back to the negative state that you

519
00:29:15.091 --> 00:29:16.800
were in because of the trauma?

520
00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:19.920
Like are there things that people have to avoid once they go through this

521
00:29:19.921 --> 00:29:23.190
process to keep from,
for biofeedback?
No,
not generally.

522
00:29:23.191 --> 00:29:26.190
The neurofeedback or biofeedback processes typically changing the brain and

523
00:29:26.191 --> 00:29:28.740
changing it permanently.
Permanently.
It's kind of like if,
you know,

524
00:29:28.741 --> 00:29:31.950
if you were limping because your left knee was off and he went to do six months

525
00:29:31.951 --> 00:29:36.360
of physical therapy from then on you're walking with appropriate gate and you're

526
00:29:36.361 --> 00:29:41.250
always practicing the new muscles and coordination and things.
So,
uh,

527
00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:43.690
neurofeedback isn't permanent for everything.

528
00:29:44.010 --> 00:29:48.190
There's an active disease process going on like schizophrenia or HIV or

529
00:29:48.191 --> 00:29:51.880
something.
Then the problems you able to reduce can reemerge.

530
00:29:52.210 --> 00:29:57.210
But if your gut like ADHD or migraines or sleep issues or anxiety or trauma or

531
00:29:57.281 --> 00:29:59.410
OCD or PTSD or you know,

532
00:29:59.530 --> 00:30:03.070
these things all do appear to change and change in a largely permanent way for

533
00:30:03.071 --> 00:30:06.640
most people.
Wow.
That's amazing.
That's incredible.

534
00:30:06.641 --> 00:30:08.230
And how long has this process,

535
00:30:08.231 --> 00:30:11.560
like say if you take someone who's had a traumatic childhood and issues with

536
00:30:11.561 --> 00:30:13.860
abuse and substance abuse because of that,

537
00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:16.860
and then they enter into some sort of a treatment like this.
How,

538
00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:21.700
how long of a process?
Yeah,
most of my clients start off with,
um,
some,
uh,

539
00:30:21.701 --> 00:30:22.660
training program.

540
00:30:22.661 --> 00:30:25.210
It's to going to the gym if you go to the gym once every so often doesn't do

541
00:30:25.211 --> 00:30:25.660
much.

542
00:30:25.660 --> 00:30:30.040
So I asked my clients to come in two or three times a week for about 30 sessions

543
00:30:30.041 --> 00:30:31.660
total.
And that's enough.

544
00:30:31.661 --> 00:30:35.680
30 sessions is enough typically to make one and a half to two standard

545
00:30:35.681 --> 00:30:37.810
deviations of change.
Pretty big change.

546
00:30:37.990 --> 00:30:41.800
So can take our dramatically ADHD person and give them control over their

547
00:30:41.801 --> 00:30:45.160
attention management.
It can reregulate sleep,
eliminate migraines.

548
00:30:45.430 --> 00:30:48.670
So 30 sessions as my answer to that question of well,
how long does it take?

549
00:30:48.910 --> 00:30:51.400
30 sessions?
That seems really small,
you know,
three,

550
00:30:51.401 --> 00:30:55.180
four times a week you might get it done.
And uh,
you know,
six,
seven,
eight weeks,

551
00:30:55.500 --> 00:31:00.120
that's changed the,
eliminate your ADHD or anxiety or trauma.
Incredible.
Yeah.

552
00:31:00.460 --> 00:31:03.730
Now what is ADHD?
What,
what exactly is it?

553
00:31:03.731 --> 00:31:06.610
Because you hear people saying that it doesn't exist.

554
00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:10.900
You hear people saying that it's just some way they diagnosed children so they

555
00:31:10.901 --> 00:31:12.160
can give them medication.

556
00:31:12.340 --> 00:31:14.590
There's some truth to that and there's some truth to the,

557
00:31:14.650 --> 00:31:16.540
to the people saying it doesn't exist.

558
00:31:17.410 --> 00:31:21.280
I think that as a path ology as a strictly a mental illness,

559
00:31:21.550 --> 00:31:23.710
it doesn't really exist.
I think it was an exam.

560
00:31:23.740 --> 00:31:28.740
I think what we have is a natural spectrum and continuum of attention management

561
00:31:29.411 --> 00:31:30.244
resources.

562
00:31:30.340 --> 00:31:33.970
And some of us can notice everything in the environment and turn our attention

563
00:31:33.971 --> 00:31:36.760
and just be wide focused and be pulled off by all novelty.

564
00:31:37.210 --> 00:31:40.570
And other folks are good at being heads down and sustained attention.
You know,

565
00:31:40.571 --> 00:31:44.410
10,000 years ago we needed hunters who could like,
you know,
see the little,

566
00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:48.780
the little tiger hiding in the corner or the hard,
you know,
red berry hall,

567
00:31:48.781 --> 00:31:51.880
hard to spot piece of fruit hiding under the leaf who could notice all the

568
00:31:51.881 --> 00:31:53.020
little environmental cues.

569
00:31:53.230 --> 00:31:56.410
And we also need folks who could sit behind the village and like we'd the plant

570
00:31:56.430 --> 00:32:00.880
all day long.
So I think that there's a natural sort of reinforcer of human,

571
00:32:01.210 --> 00:32:01.451
you know,

572
00:32:01.451 --> 00:32:06.010
a range of human attention regulation where some folks have more novelty
seeking,

573
00:32:06.011 --> 00:32:09.610
more wide focus and other folks have more narrow or sustained attention.

574
00:32:10.030 --> 00:32:13.300
So when we say Adhd,
you know,
the,

575
00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:15.860
the diagnostic criteria,
uh,

576
00:32:16.420 --> 00:32:20.080
in general and mental health isn't really about what's going on.

577
00:32:20.081 --> 00:32:23.170
It's about what's going on and does it interfere with your life.

578
00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:28.810
So you can be really hyperactive,
really spacey,
really checked out,
really,

579
00:32:28.820 --> 00:32:31.210
you know,
hard to talk to.
But if you're successful,

580
00:32:31.211 --> 00:32:35.240
I wouldn't call it a pathology,
I wouldn't even call it ADHD.
Um,

581
00:32:35.380 --> 00:32:40.220
and to call it Adhd,
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,
the deficit is,

582
00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:43.850
implies you have less attention than average.
But you know,

583
00:32:43.851 --> 00:32:47.600
we all know ADHD people that can sit and play video games without stopping for

584
00:32:47.601 --> 00:32:51.030
20 hours straight.
That's not a deficit of attention.
That's a,

585
00:32:51.031 --> 00:32:53.540
an excess of typical attention to some extent.

586
00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:58.130
So it's really about managing your attention in ways that are appropriate to the

587
00:32:58.131 --> 00:32:59.240
demands of the environment.

588
00:32:59.241 --> 00:33:02.090
If you're a classroom teacher wants you to sit still for 45 minutes and you

589
00:33:02.091 --> 00:33:04.190
can't,
then it's a problem.

590
00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:08.300
It becomes a problem because of the classroom though,
doesn't it?

591
00:33:08.301 --> 00:33:13.301
And if you aim as someone who has this issue with attention when it comes to

592
00:33:13.380 --> 00:33:14.300
things that they're not into,

593
00:33:14.301 --> 00:33:19.280
but yet they can focus extremely well on something that they're fascinated by

594
00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:22.190
and then that benefits them and they become successful at that.

595
00:33:22.790 --> 00:33:27.790
If you are in a negative environment as far as teaching or a school and they try

596
00:33:28.641 --> 00:33:32.090
to get you to become this person who's just like everybody else,

597
00:33:32.270 --> 00:33:34.490
then it becomes something they want to medicate you with.
Right.

598
00:33:34.580 --> 00:33:36.170
And it could be mitigating away,

599
00:33:36.171 --> 00:33:39.500
medicating away something that makes you unique and could actually benefit you

600
00:33:39.501 --> 00:33:43.400
in your life.
Absolutely.
And there are benefits for having,
you know,

601
00:33:43.401 --> 00:33:46.880
more abstract thought and more novelty seeking and be able to integrate,

602
00:33:46.910 --> 00:33:50.240
you know,
abstract concepts,
especially for artists,
especially for artists,

603
00:33:50.241 --> 00:33:52.580
especially people that aren't,
you know,
like I'm,
I'm for instance,

604
00:33:52.581 --> 00:33:55.850
horrible at math.
I cannot do math in my head.
I'm dyscalculus,

605
00:33:56.330 --> 00:34:00.650
but I'm verbally about as good as it gets.
And so,
you know,

606
00:34:00.651 --> 00:34:05.210
I was always sort of not rewarded by being in math classes and really rewarded

607
00:34:05.211 --> 00:34:09.560
being in,
you know,
language or,
you know,
whenever English class,
um,
the artist,

608
00:34:09.561 --> 00:34:12.710
ADHD kid thrives in,
you know,

609
00:34:12.711 --> 00:34:17.600
one 10th of their high school classes.
Um,
potentially if it's dramatic ADHD.

610
00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:18.793
But you know,

611
00:34:19.100 --> 00:34:23.320
I would say that most people don't have dramatic attention regulation issues.

612
00:34:23.330 --> 00:34:27.590
They have minor attention regulation issues that can be changed.
Um,

613
00:34:28.070 --> 00:34:30.110
the,
you mentioned that,
uh,

614
00:34:30.170 --> 00:34:35.030
ADHD people can be fascinated with by things and really,
you know,

615
00:34:35.090 --> 00:34:39.440
pay attention.
Um,
the prefrontal Cortex,
the most,
most frontal,

616
00:34:39.441 --> 00:34:42.080
most anterior part of the brain,
the most human part,

617
00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:46.850
the part that developed the latest is really the executive of the brain,
the CEO.

618
00:34:47.420 --> 00:34:50.500
And a lot of how it does its job is by telling the rest of the brain,
no,

619
00:34:50.570 --> 00:34:53.660
you know,
don't turn your head and look at this other thing.
Don't,
you know,

620
00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:58.100
grab that woman.
Don't eat that food.
Don't you know,
it's,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.

621
00:34:58.101 --> 00:35:01.250
It was a lot of the PFC does in Adhd,

622
00:35:01.251 --> 00:35:03.530
the PFC is often underactive,
it's called it.

623
00:35:03.530 --> 00:35:08.270
The CEO is asleep at the wheel and so other parts of the brain kind of takeover.

624
00:35:08.350 --> 00:35:11.330
It's like the sensory system sees a pretty bird fly by and turns your head

625
00:35:11.331 --> 00:35:15.080
before you know it because the CEO is not telling you not to.

626
00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:18.290
Um,
this is why,
uh,

627
00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:23.380
ADHD folks tend to really pursue activities that are dangerous.

628
00:35:24.250 --> 00:35:26.810
You know,
skydiving,
motorcycle riding,
taking drugs,

629
00:35:26.811 --> 00:35:30.830
risky sex because anything risky,
challenging,
dangerous,

630
00:35:30.860 --> 00:35:35.860
lights up the PFC and really turns it on and activate it in a way that most ADHD

631
00:35:36.411 --> 00:35:38.670
people don't experience.
Most of the time.

632
00:35:39.330 --> 00:35:41.520
This is why if you have an Adhd kid,

633
00:35:41.550 --> 00:35:46.550
they train parents to yell at them to create the conflict that then produces a

634
00:35:47.581 --> 00:35:51.530
more active prefrontal cortex.
They train parents to yell at them.
Yeah.

635
00:35:51.540 --> 00:35:52.940
Without even knowing it.
They,
they,
they,

636
00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:57.120
they train people around them to create conflict with them because being yelled

637
00:35:57.121 --> 00:35:59.090
at,
being punished,
being,
you know,

638
00:35:59.220 --> 00:36:02.370
engaged aggressively lights up the prefrontal cortex.

639
00:36:02.610 --> 00:36:07.350
So they do behavior or they engage in behavior that will cause people to yell at

640
00:36:07.351 --> 00:36:11.640
them subconsciously to get the reward of having a feeling alive,
a feeling on,

641
00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:15.180
whoa,
that's freaky.

642
00:36:15.690 --> 00:36:20.690
Now when you're dealing with people that have such an incredible amount of

643
00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:22.320
variation,

644
00:36:22.650 --> 00:36:27.650
the variation between human beings and personalities and you're sticking them in

645
00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:33.080
a classroom and you're forcing them to adhere to some sort of a program that was

646
00:36:35.281 --> 00:36:37.080
designed by someone who's never going to meet them.

647
00:36:37.380 --> 00:36:41.760
And it's the same for everyone across the state core or something.
Yeah.

648
00:36:41.790 --> 00:36:42.900
Something along those lines.

649
00:36:43.170 --> 00:36:47.670
How damaging is that for someone's education?
I mean,

650
00:36:47.671 --> 00:36:52.671
it seems to me that like it just seems that that sort of pressure to conform is

651
00:36:53.841 --> 00:36:56.610
going to be met with resistance.
Yeah,
of course it will.

652
00:36:56.611 --> 00:36:59.970
And the more unusual the you are,
the harder it will be to conform.

653
00:37:00.180 --> 00:37:01.920
But I would say for most people,

654
00:37:01.921 --> 00:37:05.670
you're still getting basic skills even in these sort of homogenized program.

655
00:37:05.700 --> 00:37:10.700
And is there some benefit from just dealing with this homogenization and dealing

656
00:37:11.911 --> 00:37:15.880
with the boarding,
the curriculum,
you know,

657
00:37:15.881 --> 00:37:18.590
that they're forcing upon you just to give you just some,

658
00:37:18.630 --> 00:37:23.360
some sort of sort of stress management benefits.
I mean,
you know,

659
00:37:23.390 --> 00:37:25.110
it's certainly people management.

660
00:37:25.111 --> 00:37:28.490
You can't teach every individual kid one on one.
Um,

661
00:37:28.620 --> 00:37:32.520
and so there has to be an accommodation or a compromise somewhere for doing

662
00:37:32.521 --> 00:37:36.030
classroom in a public school,
you know,
broad teaching.
Um,

663
00:37:36.060 --> 00:37:39.280
I think technology is changing that.
I think the massively online,
you know,

664
00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:42.270
courses that are mostly free these days,
um,

665
00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:45.330
that's mostly adults taking those and taking it,
taking advantage of those.

666
00:37:45.331 --> 00:37:48.180
But I think that will change how we teach children longterm.

667
00:37:48.510 --> 00:37:51.030
It will allow more individualized.
You know,

668
00:37:51.031 --> 00:37:54.630
if you take the traditional public school common core system on one end of the

669
00:37:54.631 --> 00:37:59.520
spectrum and you look at something completely opposite,
like Montessori schools,

670
00:37:59.790 --> 00:38:04.500
Montessori is all about finding the thing the kid is interested in and then

671
00:38:04.501 --> 00:38:07.740
funneling all their learning down that one avenue of interest.

672
00:38:08.070 --> 00:38:12.390
I love the idea behind that.
But Montessori also lumps all these ages together.

673
00:38:12.450 --> 00:38:16.410
And a lot of weird social shit goes on when you have a 12 year old with a six

674
00:38:16.411 --> 00:38:20.160
year old.
Yeah,
yeah.
It's,
you know,
but that's also a little bit more,
I mean,

675
00:38:20.370 --> 00:38:24.510
I'm not sure that we need to segregate ages.
Uh,
you know,
we,

676
00:38:24.511 --> 00:38:25.950
we create cohort effects,

677
00:38:25.951 --> 00:38:29.760
people experience specific things because of the groups that are lumped in with.

678
00:38:30.180 --> 00:38:31.500
That's a little artificial.
You know,

679
00:38:31.710 --> 00:38:34.740
couple hundred years ago we had a six year old and a 12 year old and a 16 year

680
00:38:34.741 --> 00:38:39.730
old in the same classroom and they probably all learned from each other even if

681
00:38:39.731 --> 00:38:41.040
they didn't know it.
Right.

682
00:38:41.050 --> 00:38:43.810
But aren't they all in different levels of six year old and a 12 year old,

683
00:38:43.811 --> 00:38:45.400
they're going to be learning completely different maybe.

684
00:38:45.401 --> 00:38:48.400
But at six years old I was learning like most 16 year olds.
Well,

685
00:38:48.401 --> 00:38:51.820
you're a super genius dude.
Well,
you know,
hey,
thanks.
But uh,

686
00:38:51.850 --> 00:38:55.540
but the point is that even within all bunch of six year olds,
you know,
class of,

687
00:38:55.541 --> 00:38:58.360
what is that like third grade or something,
you know,

688
00:38:58.361 --> 00:39:02.440
you've got some that are functioning several years below their level.

689
00:39:02.441 --> 00:39:04.630
And some of their functioning many years above their level,

690
00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:09.280
the first intelligence tests were really age norm tests.
They said,
you know,

691
00:39:09.281 --> 00:39:12.370
here are your functioning compared to your chronological age.

692
00:39:12.371 --> 00:39:13.690
Where's your mental age?

693
00:39:14.290 --> 00:39:17.290
That was the first sort of round of intelligence tests that were created.
Um,

694
00:39:17.291 --> 00:39:20.980
it was all about age,
you know,
developmental age versus chronological age.

695
00:39:21.030 --> 00:39:23.140
But it would seem to me that it would be incredibly different.

696
00:39:23.141 --> 00:39:26.800
I'm not that aware of the Montessori system other than friends that have kids in

697
00:39:26.801 --> 00:39:30.040
it that have complaints.
But I would think that the,

698
00:39:30.070 --> 00:39:34.780
the variability would be so large that if you have a classroom of 2030 kids,

699
00:39:35.020 --> 00:39:37.180
how are you going to pay attention to each kid's needs?

700
00:39:37.180 --> 00:39:40.230
You're going to have to multiple teachers.
You do.
And,

701
00:39:40.290 --> 00:39:43.930
and in Montessori you tend to have smaller classroom sizes with w with more

702
00:39:43.931 --> 00:39:46.810
teachers,
teacher's aides,
Montessori assistance.
You know,

703
00:39:46.811 --> 00:39:51.430
in a public school you might have one teacher for 35 kids if you're lucky,

704
00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:55.330
if you're locked in and in a Montessori program with 25 or 30 kids,

705
00:39:55.331 --> 00:39:57.070
you probably have four or five adults in the room.

706
00:39:57.790 --> 00:40:01.150
Knowing what you know about the mind and the development of the mine.

707
00:40:01.180 --> 00:40:05.740
Is the current state of education,
public education in this country,

708
00:40:05.950 --> 00:40:09.340
is that one of the more frustrating things that you have to consider?
Not really.

709
00:40:09.341 --> 00:40:09.611
I mean,

710
00:40:09.611 --> 00:40:13.480
people learn so many different ways and I also don't think that learning stops

711
00:40:13.481 --> 00:40:14.530
when you're out of school.

712
00:40:14.531 --> 00:40:19.531
So I think that the role of public education should be to do as much as possible

713
00:40:19.930 --> 00:40:23.050
for as many people as possible.
But you know,

714
00:40:23.051 --> 00:40:26.620
the people at either of the extremes are never going to be well served.

715
00:40:26.621 --> 00:40:29.800
People that are struggling or people that are advanced are never going to be

716
00:40:29.801 --> 00:40:33.310
well served by,
you know,
general public education.

717
00:40:33.311 --> 00:40:37.030
While it's this sort of one to 35,
one to 40 ratio,
that was the point.

718
00:40:37.031 --> 00:40:42.031
Why is it one to 35 to 40 and why does it receive such poor funding and why do

719
00:40:42.131 --> 00:40:44.860
teachers receive such little respect?
I mean,
I'm a teacher.

720
00:40:44.861 --> 00:40:49.210
I teach at Ucla and uh,
you know,
we get paid adequately as a lecturer,
college.

721
00:40:49.270 --> 00:40:52.180
It's a college.
Um,
but even at that level,
you know,

722
00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:56.590
the pay is not all that dramatically amazing.
Um,
I feel like,
you know,

723
00:40:56.620 --> 00:40:58.870
like maybe you're implying that we should be paying people,

724
00:40:58.871 --> 00:41:03.450
shaping our young people's minds a lot and,
and treasuring their roles.

725
00:41:03.690 --> 00:41:07.000
It should be a huge honor.
Yeah.
Um,
we don't have that.

726
00:41:07.001 --> 00:41:11.350
We don't tend to have a lot of traditional mechanisms left in our sort of modern

727
00:41:11.351 --> 00:41:16.030
western culture.
We don't look at,
um,
you know,
coming of age or differences.

728
00:41:16.031 --> 00:41:16.181
I mean,

729
00:41:16.181 --> 00:41:20.500
women have an obvious coming of age thing that happens between like nine and 13.

730
00:41:20.501 --> 00:41:25.270
There's a physiologic change,
so it's obvious.
Boys don't have that.
And so,

731
00:41:25.271 --> 00:41:28.540
you know,
thousand years ago we hit 13 years old.
We were,
you know,

732
00:41:28.541 --> 00:41:31.300
made men with some ritual and we don't let them,
you know,
hunted a bore,

733
00:41:31.301 --> 00:41:33.860
who knows,
I've got a tattoo.
Uh,

734
00:41:33.890 --> 00:41:38.890
but nowadays people go from being children to adults without any clear stages,

735
00:41:39.411 --> 00:41:42.050
without the sort of social reinforcers of,

736
00:41:42.051 --> 00:41:44.900
of where you are and what your life means in terms of the community,

737
00:41:44.901 --> 00:41:47.990
in terms of your family.
So I think that's unfortunately,
you know,

738
00:41:47.991 --> 00:41:50.930
it's a function of living on a planet with 7 billion people.

739
00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:54.110
That's his topic that's been brought up on this show many,
many times.

740
00:41:54.111 --> 00:41:54.944
Cause I'm a big,

741
00:41:55.520 --> 00:42:00.520
I'm a big fan of an a big proponent of engaging in difficult activities to

742
00:42:01.730 --> 00:42:05.450
understand yourself.
And I think that coming of age rituals,

743
00:42:05.930 --> 00:42:10.040
they at the very least signified to a child.

744
00:42:10.070 --> 00:42:14.350
Like now I am this.
Yeah.
In martial arts you get belts.
Yup.

745
00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:17.690
And you know when you achieve,
you know your blue belt,

746
00:42:17.691 --> 00:42:21.530
there's this moment where you get that belt,
you go,
wow,
I am a blue belt now.

747
00:42:21.710 --> 00:42:23.840
And it doesn't seem like it should be much.

748
00:42:24.170 --> 00:42:28.010
But I remember when I was doing Jujitsu and I went from a white pill to a blue

749
00:42:28.011 --> 00:42:31.820
bottle.
It's like wow,
I got my blue belt.
But meanwhile I was exact same person.

750
00:42:32.090 --> 00:42:35.790
Nothing had changed and you were recognized as different and in inch in

751
00:42:35.970 --> 00:42:38.570
historical,
cultural sort of coming of age rituals,

752
00:42:38.990 --> 00:42:42.320
the young person is given advice by all the men in the village.

753
00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:44.900
All the women in the village,
they pick a new name.

754
00:42:45.020 --> 00:42:48.240
Sometimes they go through like an ordeal.
I mean the,

755
00:42:48.260 --> 00:42:50.960
the ordeal I think is what you're talking about to the ordeal.

756
00:42:50.961 --> 00:42:54.860
It should not be underestimated.
I don't know if we haven't met before.

757
00:42:54.861 --> 00:42:58.730
So I have a history as a static Sean that I'd done a lot of ecstatic work
around.

758
00:42:58.790 --> 00:42:59.511
What does that mean?

759
00:42:59.511 --> 00:43:03.830
It makes static pushing yourself hard until your reality changes.

760
00:43:04.270 --> 00:43:09.270
A Mercedes Eliade that's sort of a guy who defined Shama is defined it as

761
00:43:10.130 --> 00:43:12.260
ordinary realities,
but we all have.

762
00:43:12.470 --> 00:43:16.550
And if you push yourself hard enough through any mechanism you can think of

763
00:43:17.030 --> 00:43:20.960
eventually your reality breaks and you have other insight,
other knowledge,

764
00:43:20.961 --> 00:43:24.920
other ways of understanding the world.
And so for me,
it's been things like,

765
00:43:24.921 --> 00:43:28.250
you know,
dance all night long or drumming or you know,
other,

766
00:43:28.670 --> 00:43:29.630
other things as well.

767
00:43:29.930 --> 00:43:34.930
But the idea is to push yourself until you get out of your own way until your

768
00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:38.960
monkey mind breaks down until you leave that behind.

769
00:43:38.990 --> 00:43:43.990
So as a showman you would lead people and these dance marathons.

770
00:43:44.151 --> 00:43:47.210
Sure.
Or just do it myself.
I mean,
I'm,
I'm a west African drummer as well,

771
00:43:47.211 --> 00:43:51.680
so I'm often,
what's that mean?
It means I,
I,
I drum for dance classes.
I drum for,

772
00:43:51.740 --> 00:43:54.140
you know,
people dancing all night long,
run a fire until they,

773
00:43:54.420 --> 00:43:58.240
until they flop on the ground speaking in tongues.
The idea is to,

774
00:43:58.270 --> 00:44:02.570
is to give yourself a chance so you can change your reality.

775
00:44:02.900 --> 00:44:07.700
So you're looking at this though from the point of view of a neuroscientist and

776
00:44:07.701 --> 00:44:10.080
instead of a crazy hippie,
well,

777
00:44:10.081 --> 00:44:13.610
I was a crazy hippie before I was a neuroscientist.
You can't tell,

778
00:44:13.611 --> 00:44:16.130
but I have about as much ink as you do.
Um,

779
00:44:16.190 --> 00:44:19.070
and so I have a lot of that'd be possible when I see your forearms.
Well,

780
00:44:19.071 --> 00:44:22.200
you know,
it's,
it's all,
it's all exactly what you got,

781
00:44:22.220 --> 00:44:25.580
like flowers and now it's all [inaudible] truck and it's all Celtic and really?

782
00:44:25.610 --> 00:44:29.300
Yeah.
Um,
but you know,
I,
I grew up as like,
uh,
uh,

783
00:44:29.301 --> 00:44:31.980
on the east coast as a hard nose know east coaster.

784
00:44:31.981 --> 00:44:35.940
And I did the find this world of being a,
you know,
sort of Shaman,
if you will.

785
00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:38.340
I'm also a motorcyclist,
so I have a,
you know,

786
00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:41.670
ride cross country and do a lot of long road trips.
But yeah,

787
00:44:41.671 --> 00:44:44.890
I also put a nice dress shirt on and going,
you know,
do science too.

788
00:44:44.910 --> 00:44:49.200
You walk in and out of many worlds.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I think it's important to do that,

789
00:44:49.201 --> 00:44:53.550
to not hold any identity to rigorously.
What is your opinion of Ibogaine?

790
00:44:54.300 --> 00:44:57.930
Um,
I don't know enough about it is the short answer.
Uh,
I think it's interesting.

791
00:44:58.810 --> 00:44:59.160
Uh,

792
00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:02.790
I'm intrigued by it and I think for folks that are struggling with certain types

793
00:45:02.791 --> 00:45:04.030
of drug addiction,
uh,

794
00:45:04.220 --> 00:45:07.440
I have some clients who have gone through that particular thing and say that

795
00:45:07.441 --> 00:45:10.080
they're,
you know,
they were impressed by it or they got something out of it.

796
00:45:10.470 --> 00:45:12.230
I just don't have enough,
you know,

797
00:45:12.330 --> 00:45:14.760
real clear firsthand experience to talk about it.

798
00:45:14.761 --> 00:45:17.670
No amount of people that have done it,
I've never done it either.

799
00:45:17.671 --> 00:45:21.140
But the amount of people that have done it that have had addiction issues and

800
00:45:21.150 --> 00:45:23.700
gone through it and it's wiped out their addiction issues,

801
00:45:23.701 --> 00:45:27.060
it's a pretty staggered,
but you know,
that isn't only true of Ibogaine.

802
00:45:27.061 --> 00:45:32.010
That's true of things like,
um,
Moscow Iowasca,
mushrooms,
Ketamine,

803
00:45:32.070 --> 00:45:35.550
um,
electric convulsive shock therapy.
Really these things.

804
00:45:35.551 --> 00:45:37.890
And this is a hypothesis.
I'm,
you know,
this is a theory.

805
00:45:37.891 --> 00:45:42.570
I have that all of these things act this in a similar way on the brain to reset

806
00:45:42.571 --> 00:45:47.240
to cause a systemic wide sort of flip the switch.
Um,
you know,

807
00:45:47.310 --> 00:45:50.970
ECT is still used for medication resistant depression.

808
00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:54.990
It's one of the few things that works.
If drugs don't work for you,
depression,

809
00:45:55.020 --> 00:45:59.490
ECT will lift your depression.
Um,
so we'll ketamine,
you know,

810
00:45:59.491 --> 00:46:01.380
one is zapping you when is sedating you,

811
00:46:01.410 --> 00:46:04.350
but I think they're really going after sort of a reset,
uh,

812
00:46:04.370 --> 00:46:05.700
deep in the brain in some way.

813
00:46:05.730 --> 00:46:10.730
So this transformative experience being so completely alien to normal states of

814
00:46:11.311 --> 00:46:16.311
consciousness is enough to give you this new new blank slate or at least know

815
00:46:17.340 --> 00:46:20.880
starting point,
or at least,
you know,
maybe it could be sort of hormetic,

816
00:46:20.881 --> 00:46:23.790
it could be a stress or your body reacts to with healing.

817
00:46:24.120 --> 00:46:29.120
So I'm almost anything that affects depression that lifts depression does.

818
00:46:30.061 --> 00:46:34.560
So by raising neurotrophic factor in the hippocampus,

819
00:46:34.600 --> 00:46:36.390
hippocampus is involved with memory formation,

820
00:46:36.391 --> 00:46:40.650
also exploring the environment and there's a compound called BDNF,

821
00:46:40.651 --> 00:46:42.700
brain derived neurotrophic factors,

822
00:46:42.710 --> 00:46:44.640
the growth hormone or growth factor and the brain.

823
00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:48.480
Anything that lifts depression raises BDNF.

824
00:46:49.890 --> 00:46:53.490
BDNF is the final common pathway,
if you will,
of antidepressants.

825
00:46:53.600 --> 00:46:57.900
It's not Serotonin,
dopamine,
norepinephrine,
it's not exercise.

826
00:46:58.250 --> 00:46:59.520
It doesn't matter what you say,

827
00:46:59.521 --> 00:47:04.080
your antidepressant drug or mechanism is how it actually works downstream is

828
00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:08.100
BDNF.
That's fascinating.
I'm really glad you brought up.

829
00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:12.660
Really glad you brought up the expression.
Depression.
Yeah.
Because,
um,

830
00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:15.750
I don't,
I don't suffer from depression.

831
00:47:15.780 --> 00:47:20.780
I've had many close friends who do and I've always been concerned or confused or

832
00:47:22.351 --> 00:47:26.250
curious as to what causes it.
Is it an environmental issue?

833
00:47:26.370 --> 00:47:30.220
Is it a biological issue?
Is it a combination of the two?
Yeah,
because

834
00:47:30.220 --> 00:47:35.110
<v 2>I've had friends whose lives were not going well.
Their career wasn't going well,</v>

835
00:47:35.111 --> 00:47:38.770
their romantic life wasn't going well,
and they were quote unquote depressed.

836
00:47:39.100 --> 00:47:41.410
Then their career turned around,

837
00:47:41.411 --> 00:47:44.690
the romantic life turned around and they were no longer depressed.
Yeah.

838
00:47:44.890 --> 00:47:48.640
And so I've always wondered how much of this idea that we have of someone being

839
00:47:48.641 --> 00:47:51.970
sick.
It's just based on the input that you're getting from your environment,

840
00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:54.370
whether or not you're getting positive feedback.
If you're in love,

841
00:47:54.520 --> 00:47:56.950
you'll feel great.
You know,
you're with someone you care to be with.

842
00:47:57.070 --> 00:47:59.830
If you have a job that's awesome,
you get excited to go to work.

843
00:48:00.010 --> 00:48:02.830
All these things are good.
You're,
you're,
you're,
you're doing well.

844
00:48:02.831 --> 00:48:04.180
You don't have to worry about your bills.

845
00:48:04.420 --> 00:48:08.440
You're in a rewarding relationship where you feel supported and loved.

846
00:48:08.470 --> 00:48:13.470
You don't have this feeling all the time of being lonely or being left out.

847
00:48:14.380 --> 00:48:16.960
How much of that is it an environmental issue?

848
00:48:17.110 --> 00:48:21.550
How much of that is just your brain is lacking a certain amount of pills and how

849
00:48:21.551 --> 00:48:26.290
many people are medicated because their environment is shitty.

850
00:48:26.530 --> 00:48:31.150
And so instead of giving you the impetus to change and alter your environment to

851
00:48:31.151 --> 00:48:35.710
benefit you,
you're instead given a pill that makes your environment tolerance.

852
00:48:35.750 --> 00:48:38.940
<v 0>Well,
yeah,
that's a really complex question.
Um,</v>

853
00:48:39.110 --> 00:48:40.320
there's a few things to think about.

854
00:48:40.321 --> 00:48:45.321
One is things like depression or anxiety aren't always bad.

855
00:48:46.440 --> 00:48:50.100
You know,
there's often a good reason to be sad or a good reason to be tense.

856
00:48:50.101 --> 00:48:53.460
You know,
like if your spouse dies,
you're going to be depressed.
You know,

857
00:48:53.461 --> 00:48:57.330
you have an exogenous and outside cause for your depression.
You lose your job.

858
00:48:57.331 --> 00:49:00.000
You,
you know,
your bank account's empty.

859
00:49:00.001 --> 00:49:03.810
There's lots of good reasons to be stressed and to have sort of negative

860
00:49:03.811 --> 00:49:06.420
emotional reactions to those things.
Anxiety is the same way.

861
00:49:06.421 --> 00:49:10.470
If you're being chased by a tiger,
you better be anxious.
You better run.
Um,

862
00:49:11.040 --> 00:49:14.370
when someone's life becomes less stressful,
you're right.

863
00:49:14.371 --> 00:49:17.370
Some people become not depressed anymore and that's,

864
00:49:17.371 --> 00:49:20.460
I would consider that like a low key form of depression if,

865
00:49:20.730 --> 00:49:24.870
if they just get a little bit depressed or depressed because of exogenous life

866
00:49:24.871 --> 00:49:27.540
things.
Um,
the,
all the diagnosis,

867
00:49:27.680 --> 00:49:31.950
a diagnostic criteria for depression suggest that you need to have all these

868
00:49:31.951 --> 00:49:34.640
symptoms for many weeks occur.

869
00:49:34.650 --> 00:49:39.300
I think it's two or three weeks minimum across more than one domain of your
life.

870
00:49:39.930 --> 00:49:44.930
So it's not simply being sad for a few weeks because of a bad thing that

871
00:49:46.381 --> 00:49:47.214
happened too.

872
00:49:47.310 --> 00:49:52.110
It's what happens with how your emotional regulation gets changed by that or

873
00:49:52.111 --> 00:49:55.470
turns into a problem.
So there are many people,
their lives get better.

874
00:49:55.471 --> 00:49:56.790
They got a new job,
they,
you know,

875
00:49:56.880 --> 00:50:01.320
have things perk up and they don't become non-depressed.
They stay depressed,

876
00:50:01.321 --> 00:50:03.300
they stay maybe just an hedonic.

877
00:50:03.301 --> 00:50:06.840
They can't experience joy for something for from,
from their life.

878
00:50:07.050 --> 00:50:08.080
Or they experienced,
you know,

879
00:50:08.130 --> 00:50:11.610
more subtle swings of mood then than full blown depression.

880
00:50:12.030 --> 00:50:16.320
But depression can last even in the face of your life being awesome.

881
00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:17.540
You know,

882
00:50:17.540 --> 00:50:22.340
<v 2>how long has it been that we've diagnosed this idea of depression?</v>

883
00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:26.060
I mean for the long time.
How long,
how many decades?

884
00:50:26.180 --> 00:50:29.690
<v 0>Um,
several layman's.
We were three more than that.
Yeah,
I would,</v>

885
00:50:29.720 --> 00:50:32.890
I would say that major depression amendment,
I'm not actually sure when,

886
00:50:32.891 --> 00:50:34.490
when it crept into the Dsm,

887
00:50:34.640 --> 00:50:37.790
the whole issue of diagnosis is a very thorny issue anyways.

888
00:50:37.791 --> 00:50:42.470
The DSM was not really develop the diagnostic and statistical manual,

889
00:50:42.471 --> 00:50:46.310
which is what psychologists and psychiatrists use for diagnoses was not really

890
00:50:46.311 --> 00:50:48.740
developed to help with diagnoses.

891
00:50:48.950 --> 00:50:52.880
It was developed to help with insurance companies.
It's Kinda like the BMI.

892
00:50:53.070 --> 00:50:56.420
The Bmi for you and me would say we're overweight,

893
00:50:56.421 --> 00:50:59.900
if not obese because we're pretty beefy guys,

894
00:51:00.500 --> 00:51:05.120
but I'm not obese at 180 pounds.
Right.
You know,
but if I was,

895
00:51:05.150 --> 00:51:07.970
if my body fat was higher,
muscle mass was lower,
I would be.

896
00:51:08.810 --> 00:51:10.670
And the same thing's true with diagnoses.

897
00:51:10.671 --> 00:51:14.660
It was really a tool used to figure out what to pay on insurance to some extent.

898
00:51:15.110 --> 00:51:19.490
And so at a population level,
if I took a thousand people,
the BMI would,

899
00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:23.390
would work pretty well for most of them.
And the same is true of the DSM.

900
00:51:23.570 --> 00:51:25.760
It works pretty well at a population level.

901
00:51:26.420 --> 00:51:29.600
But when you drill down to the individual,
sometimes their symptoms don't fit.

902
00:51:29.601 --> 00:51:33.740
The DSM or the how long they've had symptoms for or the or the course of their

903
00:51:33.741 --> 00:51:37.100
disease hasn't really totally fit.
And as a psychologist say,
oh,

904
00:51:37.101 --> 00:51:40.040
you don't fit all the criteria,
therefore I can't give you a diagnosis.
No,

905
00:51:40.041 --> 00:51:44.540
they pick whatever's closest since you're an insurance company can pay for their

906
00:51:44.541 --> 00:51:49.280
therapy and so that you can maybe get the drugs that they want to give you.
Um,

907
00:51:49.370 --> 00:51:50.570
so it's a pretty vague,

908
00:51:50.571 --> 00:51:55.571
I mean the diagnoses is not as precise a field as a non psychologist might,

909
00:51:56.120 --> 00:51:56.953
might think.

910
00:51:56.990 --> 00:52:00.890
I love that you used the term disease cause that's what I wanted to bring up

911
00:52:00.891 --> 00:52:04.100
because that's what it's,
it's referred to as depression disease.
Yeah.

912
00:52:04.370 --> 00:52:07.670
Depression is a disease and you hear it all the time and I,

913
00:52:07.820 --> 00:52:11.240
you hear it oftentimes in commercials that are selling drugs.

914
00:52:11.241 --> 00:52:13.760
And that really concerns me because I'm like,
well,

915
00:52:13.761 --> 00:52:18.470
you might be giving someone the green light to take a pill and it takes away the

916
00:52:18.471 --> 00:52:22.550
power from them,
takes away the power to change your life,

917
00:52:22.551 --> 00:52:26.660
to alter your life for the better because you've got this horrible scenario in

918
00:52:26.661 --> 00:52:29.750
your life,
horrible situation,
circumstances,
whatever.

919
00:52:29.751 --> 00:52:31.880
They're leading you to feel like shit all the time.

920
00:52:32.120 --> 00:52:33.680
And someone's coming along and saying,
hey man,

921
00:52:33.681 --> 00:52:37.490
you don't need to get a better job.
You know,
you're depressed.
Right.
And you know,

922
00:52:37.491 --> 00:52:41.730
all those disease,
it,
I mean I think it is a disease because it's not at ease.

923
00:52:42.210 --> 00:52:45.340
Is Dis ease.
You're not at ease.
Sure,
sure.
Um,

924
00:52:45.450 --> 00:52:47.900
I think it can become a disease.

925
00:52:47.901 --> 00:52:50.480
It can become entrenched and become stuck in that mode.

926
00:52:50.480 --> 00:52:53.920
And that's when it's a big problem.
Uh,
you know,
um,

927
00:52:53.990 --> 00:52:56.930
from the point of view of brain activity,
if you look at depressed brains,

928
00:52:56.931 --> 00:53:00.560
if I brought it up a hundred depress brains into my clinic and did brain mapping

929
00:53:00.561 --> 00:53:01.670
or Q EEG on them,

930
00:53:01.700 --> 00:53:06.700
what I would find in most of them is an asymmetry in the frontal lobes.

931
00:53:07.670 --> 00:53:12.560
Many people who are depressed have an overactive right frontal lobe and an

932
00:53:12.590 --> 00:53:13.760
underactive left.

933
00:53:13.970 --> 00:53:17.930
This bias of left side being more active than right as typical glass half empty

934
00:53:17.931 --> 00:53:18.300
approach.

935
00:53:18.300 --> 00:53:22.040
The world explore environments when the right is more active than the left,

936
00:53:22.340 --> 00:53:24.830
he withdraw.
You shut down,
you don't want to do.

937
00:53:25.860 --> 00:53:30.660
And so there is a brain signature often present in major depression of a left

938
00:53:30.661 --> 00:53:33.000
right bias that goes in the opposite direction.
You know,

939
00:53:33.001 --> 00:53:36.690
if you measured the Dalai Lama,
he'd be really strong.
Left biased was,

940
00:53:36.691 --> 00:53:39.210
what about bullshit?
Zero part that says bullshit.

941
00:53:39.270 --> 00:53:43.490
Can you find out what that is on him?
Uh,
do the,
do you think he's full of Shit?

942
00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:48.540
Thank God I'm not buying the robes.
Uh Huh.
No.
Okay.
All right.
All right.

943
00:53:48.690 --> 00:53:49.381
What came first,

944
00:53:49.381 --> 00:53:52.950
the chicken or the egg though when it comes to this right left brain thing.

945
00:53:53.010 --> 00:53:55.920
Really good point.
Yeah.
I have no idea.
I mean I've never,
you know,

946
00:53:55.980 --> 00:53:59.490
track someone through being non-depressed into depressed cause they'll come and

947
00:53:59.491 --> 00:54:00.630
see me once they're depressed.

948
00:54:00.631 --> 00:54:04.110
So it could be a predisposition your brain in a little bit like this and you're

949
00:54:04.111 --> 00:54:05.220
a little bit,
you know,

950
00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:09.390
oriented towards becoming a little bit depressed and then stress sores mount,

951
00:54:09.720 --> 00:54:10.980
I mean jeans are the same way.

952
00:54:10.981 --> 00:54:15.981
Genes only account for about 30% of our experience and 70% of our experiences.

953
00:54:16.440 --> 00:54:20.370
How the environment interacts with us.
And the same is true of anything else.

954
00:54:20.371 --> 00:54:21.930
It's cognitive or psychological.

955
00:54:22.110 --> 00:54:25.140
You may have a slight tendency towards a depressed brain,
you know,
right.

956
00:54:25.141 --> 00:54:26.250
Front dominance.

957
00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:31.080
But unless your life becomes sucky or things really build up or you feel unsafe

958
00:54:31.081 --> 00:54:35.520
or unmet or on,
you know,
fed or or something else you might ever develop.

959
00:54:35.521 --> 00:54:37.920
The depression patterns that really you get stuck in.

960
00:54:38.220 --> 00:54:42.480
Have you ever monitored people pre and post depression or someone who has

961
00:54:42.481 --> 00:54:45.840
recovered from it?
And what are the,
what are the changes that you observe?
I mean,

962
00:54:45.841 --> 00:54:48.480
all the time you see the asymmetry reverse,

963
00:54:48.481 --> 00:54:51.560
go back to the sort of normal or typical brain patterns.
Yeah,

964
00:54:51.780 --> 00:54:53.010
it happens all the time.
We,

965
00:54:53.011 --> 00:54:56.070
not every person with depression has frontal asymmetries,

966
00:54:56.370 --> 00:55:00.180
but it's happens often enough that I believe it when I see it in the brain maps

967
00:55:00.181 --> 00:55:01.440
as a sign.
I mean,

968
00:55:01.460 --> 00:55:04.470
often new brain maps without doing clinical histories first because I don't want

969
00:55:04.471 --> 00:55:08.250
to be biased.
So I'll sit you down and you know,
record some baselines.

970
00:55:08.251 --> 00:55:11.790
And then after I have the date,
I'll say,
okay,
I'm seeing this pattern,

971
00:55:11.791 --> 00:55:14.560
I'm seeing some frontal asymmetries,
you know,
this,
this thing here.
Uh,

972
00:55:14.640 --> 00:55:18.510
the literature suggests and many people that come into my clinic have some

973
00:55:18.511 --> 00:55:22.390
depression when they see this pattern.
Is that true for you?
And I usually get a,

974
00:55:22.391 --> 00:55:25.470
yeah.
How'd,
you know,
um,
or anxiety.
There's patterns for,

975
00:55:25.471 --> 00:55:29.550
there's patterns for Adhd or trauma,
you know,
CD or PTSD.
Um,

976
00:55:29.850 --> 00:55:34.850
and so I tend to unpack what I'm looking at based on their symptoms and then

977
00:55:35.461 --> 00:55:38.340
confirm,
uh,
get them to confirm what I'm guessing.

978
00:55:38.490 --> 00:55:41.920
So now I want to do a brain scan.
Before I was really not interested.

979
00:55:41.930 --> 00:55:43.800
I want to find out what the fuck is wrong with.
There you go.

980
00:55:44.070 --> 00:55:46.530
I want to get into that.
Come down to Beverly Hills and uh,
we'll uh,

981
00:55:46.560 --> 00:55:49.810
we'll hook you up.
How long does it take?
It takes under an hour.
Uh,
and if we,

982
00:55:49.811 --> 00:55:52.350
and we can do a pre and post a two condition map for you.

983
00:55:52.351 --> 00:55:56.580
If you wanted like a totally clean off of caffeine or you know,
something else.

984
00:55:56.610 --> 00:55:59.520
Marijuana.
Marijuana.
I have to beat around the Bush,
man.

985
00:55:59.521 --> 00:56:02.610
I started looking at Frank's.
No problem.
They look a little half smile.
Yeah,
sure,

986
00:56:02.611 --> 00:56:06.600
sure.
So if you want to,
you know,
come in one day without having smoked up,

987
00:56:06.750 --> 00:56:09.960
get a brain map that's going to be tough and then smoke up.
Um,

988
00:56:09.990 --> 00:56:13.390
we'll do another brain map and I'll show you how your brain changes.
Um,

989
00:56:13.740 --> 00:56:17.160
and here's something interesting.
Uh,
the brain mapping is the assessment process.

990
00:56:17.161 --> 00:56:19.590
We often do the neurofeedback with the training process.

991
00:56:20.100 --> 00:56:24.580
Neurofeedback seems to reset tolerance to cannabis in a few days.

992
00:56:25.210 --> 00:56:28.330
Neurofeedback,
meaning biofeedback on brainwaves,

993
00:56:28.780 --> 00:56:30.370
biofeedback on brainwaves,

994
00:56:30.371 --> 00:56:34.030
meaning what does that meeting a training up or down specific like making your

995
00:56:34.031 --> 00:56:36.070
brain make more Beta and less feta,

996
00:56:36.100 --> 00:56:39.940
which isn't an attentive focused call state.

997
00:56:39.970 --> 00:56:41.140
And how would you do that?

998
00:56:41.170 --> 00:56:44.020
So I would stick electrode to the top of your head and measure the amount of

999
00:56:44.021 --> 00:56:47.110
let's say Theta Theta is a brainwave that when it goes up,
you're distracted,

1000
00:56:47.111 --> 00:56:49.300
impulsive,
checked out.
When it goes down,

1001
00:56:49.301 --> 00:56:52.510
you're focused and it's going to fluctuate moment to moment cause you aren't

1002
00:56:52.511 --> 00:56:55.330
making a static amount of this brainwave.
You're making,
you know,

1003
00:56:55.360 --> 00:56:58.150
the amount of your environment and your internal environment demands.

1004
00:56:58.570 --> 00:57:02.790
And so whenever it tends to trend down,
maybe uh,
I'll,

1005
00:57:02.860 --> 00:57:06.040
I'll have you play one of your podcasts and the volume swell,
the volume,

1006
00:57:06.041 --> 00:57:07.480
your pockets would go up whenever your state,

1007
00:57:07.481 --> 00:57:10.870
it goes down and everything and it goes back up.
The volume drops.

1008
00:57:10.871 --> 00:57:13.150
And so your brain goes,
hey wait,
I was listening to that,
you know,

1009
00:57:13.151 --> 00:57:16.360
interesting guy.
And over several,
you know,

1010
00:57:16.361 --> 00:57:21.361
over half an hour you might have several hundred of these resuming of feedback

1011
00:57:21.730 --> 00:57:24.640
of rewards and that can be something like an audio or a video.

1012
00:57:24.640 --> 00:57:26.050
It can be a spaceship flying.

1013
00:57:26.250 --> 00:57:29.710
It doesn't seem to matter how we reward the brain when training.

1014
00:57:30.400 --> 00:57:34.420
Just when we yoke the rewards to some parameter that's changing in your brain

1015
00:57:35.230 --> 00:57:40.230
and by just stimulating various areas on the scalp,

1016
00:57:40.660 --> 00:57:45.390
just measuring areas,
just measuring area.
She stimulate the stimulus,
the the,

1017
00:57:45.391 --> 00:57:50.320
the feedback is actually coming in your eyes and ears,
music,
video,
animations,

1018
00:57:50.650 --> 00:57:53.950
but then you know when your brain trends or drifts in the wrong direction,

1019
00:57:54.010 --> 00:57:58.150
the game stops,
the music stops,
the podcast,
audio drops,
whatever it is you're,

1020
00:57:58.180 --> 00:57:59.160
you're,
you're playing with on the,

1021
00:57:59.170 --> 00:58:03.490
on the computers and it causes your mind to want to get it back.
Your brain,

1022
00:58:03.510 --> 00:58:07.030
your lower level in your mind.
Yeah.
Okay.
We'll define the difference.

1023
00:58:07.031 --> 00:58:09.250
What's the Dif?
The mind is what you're aware of.
I would say,

1024
00:58:09.280 --> 00:58:12.310
and this is a more core low level,
I mean this,

1025
00:58:12.311 --> 00:58:16.740
this process of biofeedback was discovered in the late sixties on cats,
cats,

1026
00:58:16.750 --> 00:58:20.050
and a tourist Lee,
bad instruction followers,
right?
Fuckers,
right?

1027
00:58:20.051 --> 00:58:22.390
So you're never going to,
this is not a cognitive process.

1028
00:58:22.391 --> 00:58:24.880
Cats didn't try to make,
in this case,

1029
00:58:24.881 --> 00:58:28.540
cat's got a dropper of milk whenever their brainwaves and up in one direction,

1030
00:58:28.570 --> 00:58:32.680
milk came out of a dropper and they learned over time to produce more of this

1031
00:58:32.681 --> 00:58:36.940
brainwave that gave them the milk dropper fascinate.
And then six months of this,

1032
00:58:36.941 --> 00:58:39.940
this one experiment that a Dr. Barry Sterman did in the late six days,

1033
00:58:40.090 --> 00:58:41.050
six months later,

1034
00:58:41.051 --> 00:58:45.760
he pulled a bunch of cats out of his subject pool to do a rocket fuel exposure

1035
00:58:45.761 --> 00:58:48.820
experiment.
NASA had said,
hey look,
our astronauts are getting really sick.

1036
00:58:49.300 --> 00:58:52.120
They're getting nauseous.
How dangerous is this?
You know,

1037
00:58:52.121 --> 00:58:54.400
hydrazine stuff we're using as rocket fuel.

1038
00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:57.340
Could you please expose a bunch of animals to it and see,
you know,

1039
00:58:57.341 --> 00:59:01.720
how much it takes to kill them or,
or,
or what the dose response curve is.

1040
00:59:01.720 --> 00:59:05.620
And so doctor Sterman at Ucla in the late sixties,
um,

1041
00:59:05.650 --> 00:59:09.650
it was exposing cats to increasing levels of rocket fuel vapors and found that

1042
00:59:09.680 --> 00:59:13.450
little bit,
you know,
they planted a little more,
they stumbled a little more,

1043
00:59:13.451 --> 00:59:17.710
they cried.
And then like seizure,
coma,
death,
this nice linear,
you know,

1044
00:59:17.711 --> 00:59:21.920
with increasing dose except of the cats,
he was using a certain subset,

1045
00:59:21.921 --> 00:59:25.400
like six of 30 or something,
refuse to have seizures.

1046
00:59:25.580 --> 00:59:28.880
And the whole curve of unstable brain was pushed to the right.

1047
00:59:29.900 --> 00:59:32.030
Couldn't figure out why until you realize,
oh,
wait a minute.

1048
00:59:32.060 --> 00:59:36.260
I use these same six cats in a previous experiment to increase their brainwaves

1049
00:59:37.010 --> 00:59:40.320
in this one brainwave that,
that I thought was a nice target to go after.

1050
00:59:40.321 --> 00:59:43.640
And it turns out that brainwave is the antiseizure brainwave.

1051
00:59:43.641 --> 00:59:44.300
When you train it up,

1052
00:59:44.300 --> 00:59:47.480
you have decreased dramatically decreased seizure activity in the brain.

1053
00:59:48.530 --> 00:59:52.710
And so he found this,
you know,
this brainwave was sort of metta stable in,

1054
00:59:52.720 --> 00:59:54.470
in encouraging brain activity.

1055
00:59:54.950 --> 00:59:59.510
And his a lab manager at the time was a medication,
uncontrolled,
epileptic,

1056
00:59:59.780 --> 01:00:04.090
having like tens of seizures a month,
which is basically a death sentence.

1057
01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:07.370
Your brain will,
you know,
Swiss cheese over time and you'll,
you'll have major,

1058
01:00:07.371 --> 01:00:10.550
major longterm problems.
Um,
and she demanded,

1059
01:00:10.551 --> 01:00:13.190
he built her a biofeedback machine to train up this brainwave.

1060
01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:14.450
And over the next year or two,

1061
01:00:14.451 --> 01:00:17.240
they did some training and after a couple of years she went off all meds.

1062
01:00:17.241 --> 01:00:20.360
I'm a seizure-free.
Wow,
that's crazy.

1063
01:00:20.930 --> 01:00:25.850
And about that time Barry Sterman funding was all pulled.
Really.
He probably,

1064
01:00:25.851 --> 01:00:29.980
he submitted a paper to Epilepsia the journal and suddenly his,
uh,

1065
01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:35.280
government funding all vanished.
So the conspiracy theorist,

1066
01:00:35.281 --> 01:00:38.430
uh,
you know,
ideas start to mount.
When you think about,
you know,

1067
01:00:38.440 --> 01:00:42.800
the late sixties and big drug companies not wanting a non drug intervention for

1068
01:00:42.801 --> 01:00:47.030
epilepsy out there.
Now,
what is the current protocol on this stuff today?
I mean,

1069
01:00:47.031 --> 01:00:50.510
how many people are using this kind of treatment with epilepsy?
I'm not sure,

1070
01:00:50.511 --> 01:00:52.340
actually.
I'm not an epileptologist.

1071
01:00:52.341 --> 01:00:55.100
I've had a few folks come through my center who do have seizures and I've

1072
01:00:55.101 --> 01:00:56.860
reduced them.
Um,
but,
uh,

1073
01:00:56.861 --> 01:01:00.120
I'm not sure of the numbers of epileptologists out there using it.
Um,

1074
01:01:00.170 --> 01:01:03.770
the numbers of neurofeedback providers,
I'm just as a hand waving guests.

1075
01:01:03.800 --> 01:01:08.240
Let's say this 10,000 in the u s and there's many more of course throughout the

1076
01:01:08.241 --> 01:01:10.460
world.
When I go to big conferences,
there's,
you know,

1077
01:01:10.490 --> 01:01:12.180
a thousand to 1500 people at the tray,

1078
01:01:12.200 --> 01:01:15.830
the professional trade shows for this stuff,
and it's two of them.
So you figure,

1079
01:01:15.831 --> 01:01:20.090
extrapolate and at least 10,000 practitioners in a,
in the u s in fact,

1080
01:01:20.150 --> 01:01:23.270
just down the street here in Woodland Hills,
some of the,
the,

1081
01:01:23.300 --> 01:01:26.720
the giants in the field,
the authors,
they sort of founded the field,
uh,

1082
01:01:26.990 --> 01:01:31.250
soon after Sterman made these discoveries.
The authors,
um,
uh,

1083
01:01:31.580 --> 01:01:36.140
at EEG info launched,
um,
sort of the field of neurofeedback for clinicians.

1084
01:01:36.141 --> 01:01:39.710
They built software and hardware for many years for clinicians to use.
Well,

1085
01:01:39.711 --> 01:01:41.630
that is unbelievable.

1086
01:01:41.631 --> 01:01:45.710
The idea that they would pull funding just because he's come up with something

1087
01:01:45.711 --> 01:01:49.490
that takes away from the money that the farms and who knows if that's actually

1088
01:01:49.491 --> 01:01:53.690
what happened.
But it's a good story that there's this potential,
you know,

1089
01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:56.930
sort of big brother,
big Pharma,
a inflection.

1090
01:01:56.931 --> 01:02:01.480
And this is not beyond the pale.
This is,
this is very possible.
You know,
when,
um,

1091
01:02:01.580 --> 01:02:03.560
when neurofeedback started getting really big,

1092
01:02:03.561 --> 01:02:05.750
a lot of what it was first used for his Adhd,

1093
01:02:05.990 --> 01:02:08.690
it's sort of the magic bullet for Adhd.
You know,

1094
01:02:08.840 --> 01:02:13.310
it's called the 20 hours solution for Adhd.
Um,
when,

1095
01:02:13.370 --> 01:02:17.810
uh,
this is starting to really be used maybe 15,

1096
01:02:17.811 --> 01:02:20.130
20 years ago,
um,
a couple of the big

1097
01:02:20.130 --> 01:02:23.670
<v 2>drug companies were paying scientists to go to Chad meetings,
the,</v>

1098
01:02:23.730 --> 01:02:28.320
the ADHD support group meetings and say,
nope,
neurofeedback doesn't work.
Wow.

1099
01:02:28.710 --> 01:02:33.380
They were being paid by the drug companies to go and,
you know,
anti Shell for,

1100
01:02:33.381 --> 01:02:35.280
for,
you know,
anti neurofeedback.
Well,

1101
01:02:35.281 --> 01:02:38.970
we find that today with marijuana and we find that today with pharmaceutical

1102
01:02:38.971 --> 01:02:43.080
companies paying people to talk badly and,
and,
and not just that,

1103
01:02:43.081 --> 01:02:46.290
but testify about the negative aspects of cannabis.

1104
01:02:46.291 --> 01:02:49.880
And then you find out they're being paid by pharmaceutical companies hundreds of

1105
01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:51.250
thousands of dollars.
Yeah.
I mean,
what,
when did money,

1106
01:02:51.251 --> 01:02:54.180
you get in so deep into not only medicine,
but politics?
I mean,

1107
01:02:54.181 --> 01:02:58.220
when you and I were kids,
this wasn't like this was it.
I don't know.
I don't know.

1108
01:02:58.270 --> 01:03:00.350
I mean,
I wasn't paying attention to as a 10 year old,
but yeah,

1109
01:03:00.660 --> 01:03:03.300
I don't think we're as aware or maybe it just wasn't as transparent.

1110
01:03:03.910 --> 01:03:07.530
We're aware of information,
you know,
being everywhere.

1111
01:03:07.531 --> 01:03:10.090
It wasn't really there in the 70s the way it is now.
Right.
So,
right.

1112
01:03:10.170 --> 01:03:13.830
Well all the Nixon studies that Nixon funded,

1113
01:03:13.831 --> 01:03:17.550
a bunch of the Nixon administration funded a bunch of studies trying to find the

1114
01:03:17.551 --> 01:03:21.140
negative aspects of cannabis and that's on sale positively not just failed,

1115
01:03:21.150 --> 01:03:24.000
found so many positive things they had to burry.
Yup.
Yeah.

1116
01:03:24.050 --> 01:03:27.860
And we're dealing with that today.
I mean,
today you still have,
uh,
there was,

1117
01:03:27.861 --> 01:03:32.120
there was this horrible story,
a horrible video of the,
uh,

1118
01:03:32.190 --> 01:03:36.120
head of the DEA having a conversation with someone in Congress where the guy is

1119
01:03:36.121 --> 01:03:37.410
breaking it down to where he's saying,

1120
01:03:37.980 --> 01:03:42.780
what is worse is cannabis as bad as math.
And she's like,

1121
01:03:42.781 --> 01:03:45.480
well,
they're both bad and they're both bad.
Okay.

1122
01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:50.760
What is w what it has a negative more negative health risks?

1123
01:03:50.940 --> 01:03:55.170
Is it cannabis or is it meth and she won't do it.

1124
01:03:55.170 --> 01:03:57.900
She won't do it because it's an ideology.
It's a,

1125
01:03:57.960 --> 01:04:02.960
she's got a very specific pattern of thinking and speaking that she's supposed

1126
01:04:04.081 --> 01:04:07.380
to engage in.
And she won't vary.
She won't deviate.
And there's not,

1127
01:04:07.410 --> 01:04:10.140
unfortunately not a lot of good research out there.
I mean,

1128
01:04:10.141 --> 01:04:13.800
I'm putting together a cannabis study with my lead tech at the alternatives and

1129
01:04:13.801 --> 01:04:16.110
we're just going through a literature review trying to figure out what the state

1130
01:04:16.111 --> 01:04:20.140
of the literature is.
And,
uh,
I'm looking at,
you know,
brain activity.
So I'm like,

1131
01:04:20.220 --> 01:04:21.240
my questions are things like,
well,

1132
01:04:21.241 --> 01:04:24.380
how long does it active in your brain and what are the brain changes that

1133
01:04:24.390 --> 01:04:25.380
cannabis produces?

1134
01:04:25.800 --> 01:04:29.640
And we're looking at studies from the 70s and some of them in the 80s and little

1135
01:04:29.641 --> 01:04:31.200
footnotes and methodology.
So,
okay,

1136
01:04:31.201 --> 01:04:35.580
the THC concentration in this study is 2% two and a half percent,

1137
01:04:35.940 --> 01:04:40.690
2.1%,
whatever.
And nowadays,
you know,
the stuff being delivered to your door,
uh,

1138
01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:44.970
from the collective is 20% 23%,
25%.

1139
01:04:45.390 --> 01:04:50.230
So cannabis has gotten 10 times as strong since our parents were,
you know,

1140
01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:53.730
well,
that's just dirt weed though.
There was a study that they did recently.

1141
01:04:53.731 --> 01:04:58.060
They said that they got ahold of some marijuana from the 1960s and seventies and

1142
01:04:58.070 --> 01:05:03.070
there the variation was between two to 5% for shitty weed but as high as 15% for

1143
01:05:03.871 --> 01:05:07.210
what they called Acapulco gold.
Since Emilia,

1144
01:05:07.240 --> 01:05:09.660
that's what the old timers used to call the good high end.

1145
01:05:09.661 --> 01:05:13.280
But that's what they call it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Um,
but so that,

1146
01:05:13.720 --> 01:05:17.710
that means that the good we'd have today and the great,

1147
01:05:17.711 --> 01:05:19.870
we'd have them are pretty similar equipment,

1148
01:05:20.110 --> 01:05:24.970
but the great we'd have today is some next level shit and all the scientists and

1149
01:05:24.971 --> 01:05:27.020
the average,
you know,
squares in the late 60,

1150
01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:31.210
it didn't have access to the acapulco gold.
How did they not a scientist?
Well,

1151
01:05:31.211 --> 01:05:34.810
I mean all the studies were done on a low potency compared to today,

1152
01:05:35.030 --> 01:05:38.230
low potency weed.
So I'm not sure why they didn't have access to it,

1153
01:05:38.231 --> 01:05:41.290
but they're all using two,
3%.
They're probably worried about the man.

1154
01:05:41.590 --> 01:05:45.520
Everybody was scared of,
uh,
you know,
giving them the good weed.
Yeah,

1155
01:05:45.550 --> 01:05:47.020
probably they didn't know anybody.

1156
01:05:47.260 --> 01:05:50.770
But today you're dealing with these botanists that are going deep and there.

1157
01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:55.890
I've heard as many as 30 to 35%.
I've never seen that much.

1158
01:05:55.910 --> 01:05:59.650
I'd want that until too much.
Right here.
35.
Wow.

1159
01:05:59.710 --> 01:06:03.250
That's a little too much oil.
Blow your fucking head off.
No,

1160
01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:06.340
that's just some crazy weed that these guys have put together.

1161
01:06:06.370 --> 01:06:07.240
30 percent's a lot.

1162
01:06:07.241 --> 01:06:10.270
I might have given it to people that are from out of town and uh,

1163
01:06:10.300 --> 01:06:13.510
they don't function well on it.
It hits them in a very strange,

1164
01:06:13.511 --> 01:06:16.660
it's funny to watch.
Then you do it during your pockets.
It's kind of cruel.

1165
01:06:16.661 --> 01:06:21.340
I've done it.
Wow.
And not cruel.
They asked for it.
They want to see what's up.

1166
01:06:21.550 --> 01:06:26.200
But the,
um,
the real issue is really that.
It's just,

1167
01:06:26.260 --> 01:06:30.670
what do you use to,
I mean if you are used to this 34% THC,
you know,

1168
01:06:30.910 --> 01:06:34.690
you take one hit and you're good.
Right?
It's like alcohol.
I mean,
is alcohol,

1169
01:06:34.780 --> 01:06:38.440
is it,
is stronger alcohol a problem?
No,
not really.

1170
01:06:38.441 --> 01:06:42.100
We know that whiskey is stronger than wine,
you know,
we know that.

1171
01:06:42.310 --> 01:06:44.440
So you drink a large glass of wine and you're fine.

1172
01:06:44.441 --> 01:06:48.990
You don't drink a large glass of whiskey.
Right.
But it's harder to,
you know,
it,

1173
01:06:48.991 --> 01:06:52.930
it's,
it's rather,
it's easy to get into trouble with whiskey than beer.
Sure.

1174
01:06:52.990 --> 01:06:57.310
Because the,
the momentum has,
you know,
faster consequences.
Yes.

1175
01:06:57.340 --> 01:07:00.340
That's a very good point.
So I wanna is the same thing.

1176
01:07:00.370 --> 01:07:04.050
And I mentioned that I eliminate tolerance to marijuana in,

1177
01:07:04.051 --> 01:07:07.780
in the first week of training.
People's tolerance is God like just gone.

1178
01:07:08.050 --> 01:07:10.450
And I work with people that are often like,
yeah man,
I'm professional.

1179
01:07:10.451 --> 01:07:13.860
I know what I'm doing.
Shut up.
Okay,
well you know,
just be really careful.
No,
no,

1180
01:07:13.861 --> 01:07:15.970
no,
no.
I'm good.
I've been smoking for 25 years.

1181
01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:20.380
How does this tolerance get minimized?
I'm not sure what the mechanism is.

1182
01:07:20.381 --> 01:07:23.320
I just know that it's a real effect cause people come back the next day like,

1183
01:07:23.321 --> 01:07:26.440
yeah man,
I smoked up and I stared at the ceiling all night.

1184
01:07:26.441 --> 01:07:28.740
I couldn't get out of the couch and I couldn't,
I was,

1185
01:07:28.870 --> 01:07:32.020
I was drooling during dinner.
We didn't talk to my wife.
What did you do?

1186
01:07:32.021 --> 01:07:33.070
To me it's like the first,

1187
01:07:33.140 --> 01:07:36.600
it's like give it a giant blunt to a high school kid has never seen we'd,
wow.

1188
01:07:37.060 --> 01:07:39.370
It's a multiple on the dose effect in some way.

1189
01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:44.400
Does it deal with the effects of it from eating it as well as smoking it or is

1190
01:07:44.861 --> 01:07:47.560
it only smoking it?
It must be.
It must be a belt.

1191
01:07:47.561 --> 01:07:51.100
I haven't actually rigorously examine the differences,
but it must be both.

1192
01:07:52.060 --> 01:07:53.680
I would wonder because the,
the,

1193
01:07:53.681 --> 01:07:57.500
the difference in eating it is very dramatically different cause you know,

1194
01:07:57.780 --> 01:08:00.400
it's processed by the liver,
you know?
Yeah.
But it's still THC.

1195
01:08:00.401 --> 01:08:04.840
I mean eventually the brain is still getting a similar effect.
It's actually not,

1196
01:08:04.841 --> 01:08:08.410
it's 11 Roxy metabolite.
When it's processed by the liver,

1197
01:08:08.411 --> 01:08:12.460
it's producing this new substance.
It's fine.
Really more psychoactive than THC.

1198
01:08:12.490 --> 01:08:14.950
I know it lasts a lot longer.
I don't,
I don't really enjoy eating it.

1199
01:08:15.270 --> 01:08:17.990
It's not just last longer.
It's a totally different drug.

1200
01:08:18.590 --> 01:08:20.000
Your liver produces this,

1201
01:08:20.060 --> 01:08:24.440
this metabolite 11 hydroxy metabolite and it's so much more potent,

1202
01:08:24.441 --> 01:08:27.740
which is why when people eat cookies,
they always think they're dying.

1203
01:08:27.860 --> 01:08:30.790
Right now he's thinking like,
oh my God,
somebody dosed it.
I give you,

1204
01:08:30.950 --> 01:08:32.900
I'm sure you've probably heard of this.

1205
01:08:32.900 --> 01:08:37.900
There's a hilarious nine one one call or these cops had stolen weed from these

1206
01:08:38.571 --> 01:08:43.571
kids and made brownies with it and then they eat the brownies and they call nine

1207
01:08:43.701 --> 01:08:47.180
one one and they're like,
Time's going by really slow.
I think we're dead.

1208
01:08:47.750 --> 01:08:50.420
You never heard it?
No,
it's hilarious.
Oh my God.
That's funny.

1209
01:08:50.870 --> 01:08:52.360
You should pull it up Jamie.
Cause it's,

1210
01:08:52.400 --> 01:08:54.650
everyone should hear this cause it's so fucking stupid.

1211
01:08:54.950 --> 01:08:57.620
It just shows you that cops are just people.

1212
01:08:57.621 --> 01:09:01.730
And the idea that you could give these people is this three,

1213
01:09:01.731 --> 01:09:05.990
nine one one call that why no charges have been filed against the police officer

1214
01:09:06.350 --> 01:09:09.920
who admits to confiscating marijuana from suspects and then baking it in

1215
01:09:09.921 --> 01:09:13.280
brownies.
I was,
he and his wife were full and high.

1216
01:09:13.281 --> 01:09:16.280
They thought they had overdosed and called nine one one person.
This,

1217
01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:21.430
<v 3>I think I'm having an overdose,
my wife over and off of what?
Marijuana.</v>

1218
01:09:21.830 --> 01:09:23.110
I don't know if they had pumpkin in it.

1219
01:09:23.410 --> 01:09:27.220
Hey police can rescue you guys have fever.
No,
I'm good.

1220
01:09:27.610 --> 01:09:31.380
I think we're dying.
Oh,
how much you guys have?
I Dunno.

1221
01:09:31.390 --> 01:09:35.440
We made brownies and I think what that time is going by really,
really,
really,

1222
01:09:35.441 --> 01:09:36.274
really glow.

1223
01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:43.360
<v 2>Yeah.
Not responsible use right there.
Yeah.</v>

1224
01:09:43.361 --> 01:09:46.830
I will listen to that to the day I die.
A fucking dummy.
Oh.

1225
01:09:47.110 --> 01:09:51.440
Oh well that's the problem with eating it.
Most people aren't aware of me.

1226
01:09:51.441 --> 01:09:54.990
Even you are not aware of eating it.
This,
it's a process called a one pass.

1227
01:09:54.991 --> 01:09:55.830
When it goes through your liver,

1228
01:09:55.831 --> 01:09:59.940
your first pass metabolism blows your brain out the back of your head.

1229
01:09:59.970 --> 01:10:01.500
Now you know,
one of the,
uh,

1230
01:10:01.950 --> 01:10:06.950
one of the tricks to bring somebody down who's over in Tallinn Ibuprofen.

1231
01:10:07.290 --> 01:10:11.990
Really?
Yeah.
Ibuprofen seems to take the edge off of weed.
So to nootropics.
Uh,

1232
01:10:12.030 --> 01:10:16.170
but Ibuprofen specifically seems to reduce the memory impairments you get when

1233
01:10:16.171 --> 01:10:18.540
you smoke.
That's fascinating.

1234
01:10:18.541 --> 01:10:21.660
The memory and for the short term memory impairment and potentially long term

1235
01:10:21.661 --> 01:10:25.830
learning memory as well.
What about the actual feeling of being high?
Does it,

1236
01:10:25.920 --> 01:10:28.350
it can mitigate just a tiny bit,
can take the edge off.
Like,

1237
01:10:28.351 --> 01:10:30.900
I've had friends that have,
you know,
oh my God,
I'm dying.
I've,
you know,

1238
01:10:30.901 --> 01:10:33.140
done too much.
I eaten three cookies or whatever.
Well,

1239
01:10:33.210 --> 01:10:35.850
here's my profit in 20 minutes later.
Okay,
thank you.
And what do you give him?

1240
01:10:35.851 --> 01:10:38.490
Like 800 milligrams.
Get like 400 and 400.
Yeah.

1241
01:10:38.620 --> 01:10:42.210
And I hear there's a new trend in a college students studying with 200

1242
01:10:42.211 --> 01:10:45.150
milligrams of Ibuprofen and a bong hit.
Whoa.

1243
01:10:45.200 --> 01:10:48.330
Because fucking they don't affect the memory formation.

1244
01:10:48.450 --> 01:10:49.620
I'm glad you brought that up.

1245
01:10:49.621 --> 01:10:53.640
Cause a big problem in college today is Adderall or,
oh my God.
Huge problem.

1246
01:10:54.300 --> 01:10:57.630
Huge.
What's going on with that?
Because that seems to me,

1247
01:10:57.631 --> 01:10:58.800
I've never done Adderall,

1248
01:10:58.801 --> 01:11:01.590
but from the people that I've talked to that have and understand it,

1249
01:11:01.950 --> 01:11:06.000
it's a stimulant.
Like very close to amphetamines,
very close to math.

1250
01:11:06.120 --> 01:11:09.180
Very close to my,
yeah,
a much lower dose and slightly different molecule,
but,

1251
01:11:09.210 --> 01:11:12.750
but very,
very close to um,
uh,
you know,
strict class trip stimulant,

1252
01:11:13.170 --> 01:11:15.930
a good friend,
the late great Robert Schimmel,

1253
01:11:15.960 --> 01:11:19.980
who was a hilarious standup comedian and a great guy.
He had a bunch of,
uh,

1254
01:11:20.100 --> 01:11:23.030
health issues himself and,
um,
uh,

1255
01:11:23.100 --> 01:11:27.990
he accidentally took Adderall once and,
uh,
he had taken the wrong medication.

1256
01:11:28.020 --> 01:11:31.020
I don't know whose it was or I don't,
I'm,
I don't remember the story,

1257
01:11:31.170 --> 01:11:34.830
but I remember he called his doctor up and he said,
hey,
I took this Adderall,

1258
01:11:34.831 --> 01:11:39.450
like,
am I fucked?
Because he had heart issues and uh,
the doctor said,
no,

1259
01:11:39.510 --> 01:11:42.570
you're going to be fine.
Just,
uh,
just ride it out.
You're going to be fine.

1260
01:11:42.571 --> 01:11:44.760
But you know,
obviously don't take it again.
But,
uh,

1261
01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:48.420
if anything goes horribly wrong,
call me but I think you're going to be fine.

1262
01:11:48.690 --> 01:11:51.900
And he said he just cleaned his house and organized his notes,

1263
01:11:52.030 --> 01:11:54.660
said he took all of his comedy notes and just went over them.
He said,

1264
01:11:54.661 --> 01:11:57.090
I couldn't believe how organized I was.

1265
01:11:57.240 --> 01:12:00.160
He was so motivated to get things done and that,

1266
01:12:00.240 --> 01:12:03.510
and that pushes stimulants does happen.
This is why students abused it.

1267
01:12:03.511 --> 01:12:08.340
But that push doesn't continue if you take it every day.
Okay.
Right.

1268
01:12:08.430 --> 01:12:11.730
So it's like you're chasing the dragon.
It has a business and the euphoria,

1269
01:12:11.731 --> 01:12:12.690
I mean your,

1270
01:12:12.700 --> 01:12:16.770
your friend had some euphoria probably from the two that goes away as soon as

1271
01:12:16.771 --> 01:12:19.860
you used to the drug.
Well he wasn't interested in doing it again.

1272
01:12:19.890 --> 01:12:21.900
He just accidentally did it.
But he was like,

1273
01:12:21.990 --> 01:12:25.320
God I got so much work done and I've,
I've heard that before.

1274
01:12:25.321 --> 01:12:26.160
Like my friend Eddie,

1275
01:12:27.240 --> 01:12:31.050
my friend Eddie problem with dated a few gals who had problems with stimulants

1276
01:12:31.380 --> 01:12:33.600
and uh,
he said he would always tell cause you go over their house,

1277
01:12:33.601 --> 01:12:36.890
it'd be fucking spotless was like those checks would always be cleaning their,

1278
01:12:36.940 --> 01:12:39.600
it was Marco.
They would just constantly be cleaning up.

1279
01:12:39.930 --> 01:12:44.640
What is it about stimulants that make you want to get things done?
Well,

1280
01:12:44.641 --> 01:12:48.510
dopamine is the primary neurotransmitter boosted by stimulants and dopamine is

1281
01:12:48.511 --> 01:12:52.800
the reward signal.
It's the salient.
This is interesting.
This is motivating.

1282
01:12:53.130 --> 01:12:57.870
So you get a motivation,
you know,
you find even boring tasks.

1283
01:12:57.930 --> 01:13:00.930
Interesting.
Wow.

1284
01:13:01.050 --> 01:13:06.050
So you would want to do things like clean your house because you want to do

1285
01:13:06.391 --> 01:13:09.960
something cause you wanna engage with your environment.
You gotta explore,

1286
01:13:10.020 --> 01:13:13.240
reshuffle,
play around with your environment.
Now for kids,

1287
01:13:13.241 --> 01:13:17.490
this chasing the dragon thing with college has got to be a giant issue though,

1288
01:13:17.491 --> 01:13:17.731
right?

1289
01:13:17.731 --> 01:13:22.500
You're popping these pills and at first it's benefiting you and then slowly that

1290
01:13:22.501 --> 01:13:24.720
starts to wear out.
So you're taking more.

1291
01:13:24.780 --> 01:13:27.300
And a lot of kids aren't ADHD don't dramatically.

1292
01:13:27.301 --> 01:13:30.390
And they're taking stimulants off label other people's,
you know,

1293
01:13:30.391 --> 01:13:33.840
black market prescriptions.
Um,
and you know,

1294
01:13:33.841 --> 01:13:36.330
there are some consequences to psychostimulants.

1295
01:13:36.331 --> 01:13:39.960
There are some negative consequences if you're not managing them in the absolute

1296
01:13:39.961 --> 01:13:40.800
right way.
You should,

1297
01:13:41.010 --> 01:13:45.630
including things like cardiovascular side effects and habit formation and

1298
01:13:45.631 --> 01:13:49.680
appetite suppression.
And you know,
all these things can cause major issues.

1299
01:13:49.681 --> 01:13:52.110
For me,
college students are some of the least healthy people anyways.

1300
01:13:52.530 --> 01:13:54.660
They're sleep deprived,
they eat like crap.

1301
01:13:54.690 --> 01:13:56.790
They don't know how to like live their lives as adults yet,

1302
01:13:56.791 --> 01:13:59.940
but they have no structure that their parents used to give them.
Um,

1303
01:13:59.941 --> 01:14:01.260
and so with all of these problems,

1304
01:14:01.261 --> 01:14:04.830
you throw a stimulant into the mix and they find they can be super productive on

1305
01:14:04.831 --> 01:14:08.320
it.
And you find kids that are now drug seeking or you know,

1306
01:14:08.321 --> 01:14:12.160
trying to get diagnoses,
they can get drugs.
You know,
we had this,
a young

1307
01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:16.840
<v 0>Gal who was an intern on fear factor back in the day and she was very nice and</v>

1308
01:14:16.841 --> 01:14:20.290
you would never think of her as being someone that had a problem with the drugs.

1309
01:14:20.890 --> 01:14:25.080
But boy you bring up aderall round her and like,
yeah,

1310
01:14:25.300 --> 01:14:29.650
her eyes would light up like she had like two like white stars for pupils and

1311
01:14:29.651 --> 01:14:32.710
she'd be like,
who has that Ross?
The cocaine response.
Right.
Oh,
that's like,
okay.

1312
01:14:32.740 --> 01:14:35.560
You know,
that's,
that's the,
that's the,
it's the,
it's the reward.

1313
01:14:35.561 --> 01:14:38.260
It's the dopamine hit.
Makes you go,
yes,

1314
01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:40.340
that's the most interesting thing I've ever heard of.
You know,

1315
01:14:40.570 --> 01:14:42.220
I was watching her and this guy,

1316
01:14:42.340 --> 01:14:45.610
this other guy who used to work there and they had this conversation and he's

1317
01:14:45.611 --> 01:14:48.280
like,
yeah,
well,
you know,
I would just take Adderall.
And she was like,

1318
01:14:48.420 --> 01:14:52.720
you've got to have the wrong,
you have Adderall.
Like,
and it was weird.

1319
01:14:52.721 --> 01:14:54.800
It was like you were watching someone like Trenton's.

1320
01:14:54.801 --> 01:14:58.090
It's like Gollum in the ring.
Yeah.
They call patches.

1321
01:14:58.990 --> 01:15:01.720
Dopaminergic drugs are,
in my opinion,

1322
01:15:01.721 --> 01:15:03.800
some of the most dangerous things we have because they,

1323
01:15:03.801 --> 01:15:06.580
they hijack learning because they really get in the way.

1324
01:15:06.581 --> 01:15:09.700
And so it's not just that it's pleasurable and that's reinforcing,

1325
01:15:09.701 --> 01:15:13.240
it's the pleasurable and dopamine gets boosted to super physiological levels.

1326
01:15:13.241 --> 01:15:17.140
Well,
how ironic that it hijacks learning when you're using it to help learn.

1327
01:15:17.170 --> 01:15:20.480
Yeah.
But you're not really learning,
right?
You're just studying.
Yeah.
Um,

1328
01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:23.590
some of the psycho stimulants do seem to improve learning.

1329
01:15:23.591 --> 01:15:25.360
I think Ritalin is in that class,
but real,

1330
01:15:25.410 --> 01:15:28.060
a very atypical psychostimulant a methylphenidate.

1331
01:15:28.061 --> 01:15:30.650
It's not a typical like Adderall or something and it,
it,

1332
01:15:30.660 --> 01:15:32.040
it actually improves games.

1333
01:15:32.240 --> 01:15:36.630
Seems to improve longterm potentiation or at least at least,
uh,
uh,

1334
01:15:36.640 --> 01:15:40.750
affected in some way that is not negative.
What about provigil and Nuvigil?

1335
01:15:40.751 --> 01:15:45.720
Those are other dramas.
Huge.
I hate them.
Really?
Yeah.
I,
uh,
uh,

1336
01:15:46.060 --> 01:15:49.880
I took modafinil provigil myself off label for attention,
uh,

1337
01:15:49.970 --> 01:15:54.490
and just about died from it.
Whoa.
Ended up in the hospital,
head to toe hives,

1338
01:15:55.040 --> 01:15:57.660
lungs closing up.
Whoa.
I've never heard that.

1339
01:15:57.670 --> 01:16:00.610
We had a massive systemic reaction to it.
And,
um,

1340
01:16:00.730 --> 01:16:03.640
people that have attention problems and I grew up,
you know,
Adhd,

1341
01:16:03.880 --> 01:16:07.150
people that have attention problems have dramatically increased side effects

1342
01:16:07.600 --> 01:16:11.830
from that class of drugs.
Provigil and Nuvigil a Daffodil Arba Daffodil.

1343
01:16:12.010 --> 01:16:15.330
I've taken that stuff and nothing,
nothing's happened to me at all.
But I,
I,

1344
01:16:15.331 --> 01:16:16.960
I'd take 150 milligrams.

1345
01:16:16.961 --> 01:16:21.040
I took a hundred a hundred every morning for two weeks.
Well,

1346
01:16:21.041 --> 01:16:23.350
it's prescribed to take every day.
I mean,
when you're prescribed,

1347
01:16:23.351 --> 01:16:24.880
take it every day,
that's how it's supposed to be.
Oh,

1348
01:16:24.881 --> 01:16:27.930
so you were giving them prescription prescription as opposed to just an x?
No,

1349
01:16:28.060 --> 01:16:31.540
I mean it was an experiment because I didn't like psychostimulants and I said,

1350
01:16:31.660 --> 01:16:34.750
how long ago was this?
This is,
uh,
just before I launched true brain,

1351
01:16:34.751 --> 01:16:38.740
which was one of the reasons I did it.
So like two and a half years ago.
Um,

1352
01:16:38.760 --> 01:16:43.690
and I ended up,
you know,
in the Er,
a UCLA,
literally head to toe hives.
I couldn't,

1353
01:16:43.750 --> 01:16:48.220
I couldn't,
I was miserable for about three and a half weeks.
Whoa.
What they said.

1354
01:16:48.221 --> 01:16:51.940
Eventually it was,
it was something called Erythema multiforme minor.

1355
01:16:51.970 --> 01:16:56.290
And there a major form that's called Steven Johnson Syndrome and that's where

1356
01:16:56.291 --> 01:16:59.900
your skin peels off.
Whoa dude.
So I,
you know,

1357
01:16:59.940 --> 01:17:02.050
I luckily didn't have that major version,

1358
01:17:02.051 --> 01:17:05.050
but I was still incredibly miserable in my lungs,
were you know,

1359
01:17:05.080 --> 01:17:07.750
having major issues.
So I,
I,
I just about died from it.

1360
01:17:07.751 --> 01:17:11.330
[inaudible] I've heard many people that are terrified of that stuff,

1361
01:17:11.331 --> 01:17:13.010
but they couldn't figure out a reason why.

1362
01:17:13.160 --> 01:17:17.960
And Yours is the first real legitimate boosts brain,
histamine.
And histamine is,

1363
01:17:17.961 --> 01:17:21.170
I call it a master neurotransmitter and all the other neurotransmitters can be

1364
01:17:21.171 --> 01:17:22.720
modulated by it.
So you raise Histamine,

1365
01:17:22.721 --> 01:17:27.470
you raise dopamine system and raise serotonin.
Um,
and for me,

1366
01:17:27.471 --> 01:17:32.350
the histamine and the brain has to caused a body histamine over sensitization or

1367
01:17:32.351 --> 01:17:35.900
reaction or something.
Wow.
So,
and this is not uncommon if you look at the old,

1368
01:17:35.901 --> 01:17:36.950
like some of the review papers,

1369
01:17:36.951 --> 01:17:41.951
I'm Anafranil you find that all of the studies on people with Adhd have

1370
01:17:42.171 --> 01:17:47.120
incredibly dramatically increased side effects compared to non ADHD people.

1371
01:17:47.750 --> 01:17:51.620
So you shouldn't use,
you know,
but after all is great.
If you're asleep,
you know,

1372
01:17:51.630 --> 01:17:54.230
a,
a narcoleptic person or somebody who's doing,
you know,
sleep,

1373
01:17:54.231 --> 01:17:55.640
wake shift disorders or things.

1374
01:17:55.970 --> 01:17:58.550
But unless you absolutely need it to modify your sleep,

1375
01:17:58.580 --> 01:18:00.700
it's not great for attention.
I mean,
I,

1376
01:18:00.730 --> 01:18:04.190
I got some mild attention benefits from it the first couple of weeks.

1377
01:18:04.630 --> 01:18:06.800
It's just nothing compared to psychostimulants.

1378
01:18:06.801 --> 01:18:09.800
It's nothing compared to neurofeedback or even like meditation.

1379
01:18:09.801 --> 01:18:13.820
Mindfulness can change your brain and shore up attention resources.

1380
01:18:14.060 --> 01:18:16.130
I want to get to mindfulness in a moment,
but what,

1381
01:18:16.131 --> 01:18:20.850
what is the difference between new vigil and provigils?
Yeah,
so Modafinil,
the,

1382
01:18:20.851 --> 01:18:24.800
the,
the first product is provigils.
The is the brand name,
um,
is a,

1383
01:18:24.801 --> 01:18:28.270
is a mix of left and right hand molecules.
Um,

1384
01:18:28.650 --> 01:18:30.860
when you're making a organic chemistry,

1385
01:18:30.861 --> 01:18:34.910
things are sort of naturally developed instead of to mirror image molecules in

1386
01:18:34.911 --> 01:18:37.070
most chemical synthesis.

1387
01:18:37.280 --> 01:18:42.280
And so there's an l and an our form of the [inaudible] in the,

1388
01:18:42.680 --> 01:18:47.360
in there mixed in the modafinil product in the,
in the arm Modafinil,

1389
01:18:47.361 --> 01:18:51.340
which is new vigil.
It's only one half.
It's the,
it's the right hand molecule.

1390
01:18:51.340 --> 01:18:56.210
They are.
Um,
and so the,
our molecule a threat ugly,

1391
01:18:56.240 --> 01:18:58.850
you know,
typically in,
in north,
in brain chemistry,

1392
01:18:59.240 --> 01:19:02.720
one of the molecules is psychoactive and one of them is much,

1393
01:19:02.721 --> 01:19:05.000
much less so and or causes side effects.

1394
01:19:05.180 --> 01:19:09.780
So a lot of the modern drugs we'll use an an l or an all forum only and get rid

1395
01:19:09.781 --> 01:19:14.060
of other half of the molecule.
Um,
Modafinil,

1396
01:19:14.090 --> 01:19:19.040
both the owl and the are a version of the molecule are psychoactive.

1397
01:19:19.580 --> 01:19:23.570
The r form is a little more psychoactive and tends to have a more stimulant type

1398
01:19:23.571 --> 01:19:27.830
feeling.
So I'm subjectively,
I've taken both subjectively.
Modafinil is,
you know,

1399
01:19:27.890 --> 01:19:31.760
interesting and has this sort of bi modal peak where you get one hump six hours

1400
01:19:31.761 --> 01:19:32.930
in another hump,

1401
01:19:32.931 --> 01:19:37.931
but 12 hours in a Arbonne FNL has the same sort of sick 12 to 16 hour window of

1402
01:19:38.361 --> 01:19:42.680
activity.
But it's only one peak of activity.
It's cause the only one molecule.

1403
01:19:42.681 --> 01:19:46.520
So in regular anafranil you're,
you're metabolizing two different substances,

1404
01:19:46.521 --> 01:19:47.320
if you will.

1405
01:19:47.320 --> 01:19:51.320
And having slightly different effects from them and the arm and Afa nails only

1406
01:19:51.321 --> 01:19:55.340
one half of the molecule of the mix of molecules you would get.

1407
01:19:55.460 --> 01:19:58.700
I've only tried new vigil,
I haven't tried to pro vigil,
but I've,

1408
01:19:58.701 --> 01:20:01.370
I've done it many times when I'm tired,
so,
so new.

1409
01:20:01.371 --> 01:20:05.000
So pro vigil will be a little bit less stimulating and you might have some

1410
01:20:05.001 --> 01:20:08.190
additional effects that are not new vigil or pro vigil.

1411
01:20:08.220 --> 01:20:12.090
Pro Pro is the mix of Lnr Nuvigil uh,
the,

1412
01:20:12.091 --> 01:20:17.040
the generic name for new vigil,
his arm and Afa?
No.
Okay.
You know,
Ar Modafinil,

1413
01:20:17.041 --> 01:20:19.980
but it's the letter r you can think of it that way for the right hand molecule

1414
01:20:20.160 --> 01:20:23.220
so that,
that's the more discreet,
theoretically if you were side effects,

1415
01:20:23.221 --> 01:20:25.020
it's a bit stronger.
In some ways.

1416
01:20:25.470 --> 01:20:30.240
I'm more of a stimulant effect where we're proper provigil or Modafinil is the,

1417
01:20:30.241 --> 01:20:32.730
is the racemic mix of the left and right hand molecules.

1418
01:20:33.030 --> 01:20:37.170
And when you started having your side effects,
was this an accumulative effect?

1419
01:20:37.171 --> 01:20:41.130
Did you
right away the no,
no,
no.

1420
01:20:41.131 --> 01:20:45.220
It took about 12,
13 days in before I had,
like I woke up,
uh,

1421
01:20:45.300 --> 01:20:49.890
my hands were kind of puffy and itchy and by the end of that day there was like

1422
01:20:49.950 --> 01:20:53.890
deep,
deep soreness and a lot of parts of my body.
And um,

1423
01:20:53.940 --> 01:20:57.600
like the Bob is my feet and my palms were like sensitive and itchy.
Whoa.

1424
01:20:57.690 --> 01:20:58.890
And I didn't take any more.

1425
01:20:58.920 --> 01:21:02.190
And the next day I woke up like with a pressure or Urticaria carrier,

1426
01:21:02.191 --> 01:21:06.480
massive hives.
So you knew that it was most likely related to that?
Well,

1427
01:21:06.481 --> 01:21:08.610
I have no allergies to any medications.

1428
01:21:08.611 --> 01:21:12.690
I've never experienced anything else like that.
I've never had hives in my life.

1429
01:21:12.691 --> 01:21:17.490
I'm not someone who gets,
you know,
hay fever.
Um,
so I had no idea.

1430
01:21:17.491 --> 01:21:22.170
But the only thing I've added into my,
uh,
sort of regimen at the same time,

1431
01:21:22.171 --> 01:21:25.260
at the end of this two weeks,
I also got the flu and it's Po,

1432
01:21:25.290 --> 01:21:27.120
it's likely that the immune,
you know,

1433
01:21:27.150 --> 01:21:32.150
sort of surge of getting the flu interacted in some way with a histamine surge

1434
01:21:32.821 --> 01:21:35.430
from the pro vigil and the two things together,

1435
01:21:35.431 --> 01:21:40.080
we're sort of a perfect storm of my body hating himself,
you know?

1436
01:21:40.950 --> 01:21:45.150
Wow.
But I am not a fan and I also think that the,
the gains,

1437
01:21:45.151 --> 01:21:49.650
the possible gains,
attention,
cognition,
focus from modafinil are,

1438
01:21:49.740 --> 01:21:53.490
are minor.
Not that dramatic.
I mean,
uh,
uh,

1439
01:21:53.610 --> 01:21:58.610
Coleen forms alpha GPC a much stronger support to cognition than Modafinil is.

1440
01:21:59.250 --> 01:22:01.500
Well,
I found that to be the case.

1441
01:22:01.790 --> 01:22:06.790
I've found Coleen to be much better as far as memory retention and execution and

1442
01:22:06.961 --> 01:22:10.620
things along those lines.
But as far as,
uh,
being awake,
yeah.

1443
01:22:10.621 --> 01:22:15.060
Less wakeful promoting wakefulness and cognition are not necessarily the same

1444
01:22:15.150 --> 01:22:18.180
thing.
Yes,
I agree.
Um,
so you know,
wakefulness,

1445
01:22:18.540 --> 01:22:21.750
if that's your issue because of narcolepsy,
because you're working night shift,

1446
01:22:21.930 --> 01:22:24.870
there may be a reason,
you know,
you're up,
you're a jet fly,

1447
01:22:24.900 --> 01:22:27.780
a jet fighter or an airline pilot,
you know,
commercial airline pilot.

1448
01:22:27.781 --> 01:22:31.300
We were up for many hours,
you know,
having to remain on.
Sure.
There's,

1449
01:22:31.310 --> 01:22:34.970
there's a reason it might make sense,
but not if you're a bio hacker.

1450
01:22:34.980 --> 01:22:37.410
Just trying to get a little more out of your schoolwork or more out of your,

1451
01:22:37.420 --> 01:22:38.610
you know,
high powered business day.

1452
01:22:38.611 --> 01:22:42.210
I don't think there's really any benefit or any good reason to take them at

1453
01:22:42.260 --> 01:22:43.920
Avondale compared to what else is out there.

1454
01:22:44.100 --> 01:22:45.900
I know a dude who's taken it every day for like eight,

1455
01:22:45.901 --> 01:22:50.340
nine years and he was wacky as fuck and I think that might've had something to

1456
01:22:50.341 --> 01:22:54.360
do with it.
Maybe just end.
I got chicken and then,
you know,
yeah.

1457
01:22:54.361 --> 01:22:56.550
Not being forthcoming about taking it either.

1458
01:22:56.850 --> 01:22:59.510
It's one of those weird things you wanted to kind of keep on the DL.
Hmm.

1459
01:23:00.440 --> 01:23:03.870
Tim Ferriss who wrote a book,
the four hour body.
Tim,

1460
01:23:04.380 --> 01:23:08.290
he didn't want to talk about it in his book because he was worried that people

1461
01:23:08.291 --> 01:23:10.030
would start taking it like candy and they,

1462
01:23:10.031 --> 01:23:13.180
and they are to some extent in some questions.
Silicon Valley Valley.
Yeah,

1463
01:23:13.200 --> 01:23:15.700
I was just going to bring that up.
Let me know.
And Dave Asprey,
he talks about,

1464
01:23:15.701 --> 01:23:17.860
you know what daffodils and they're all very pro modafinil.

1465
01:23:17.900 --> 01:23:21.370
I think I'm the only guy out there in the biohacking spaces like this stuff is,

1466
01:23:21.371 --> 01:23:25.210
saw it.
The stuff is,
is,
is minimally effective.
It's dangerous.

1467
01:23:25.570 --> 01:23:28.990
And unless you're a narcoleptic,
it's just not for you.
Well,
coincidentally,

1468
01:23:28.991 --> 01:23:33.040
you're the only one qualified to actually discuss the real mechanisms of the

1469
01:23:33.041 --> 01:23:36.360
compounds in the way you affect your brain.
Yeah,
I mean,
and,

1470
01:23:36.361 --> 01:23:39.970
and we don't know what Modafinil really does to the brain.
There's some theories.

1471
01:23:39.971 --> 01:23:41.710
We think it boosts brain histamine.

1472
01:23:41.740 --> 01:23:46.450
We think it Sorta flushes the rx system in the hypothalamus to make you wakeful.

1473
01:23:46.451 --> 01:23:51.100
But that's all still theory.
What about this shit?
Cannabis?
No,

1474
01:23:51.101 --> 01:23:53.290
this is in Canada.
What does,
this is tobacco.

1475
01:23:53.291 --> 01:23:56.980
This is one of these wacky vape pipes thing that the kids are smoking.

1476
01:23:56.981 --> 01:24:01.870
They see these things.
Interesting.
It's a vaporizer for tobacco.

1477
01:24:01.940 --> 01:24:04.420
Yeah.
Everybody's smoking tobacco out of these wacky fan.

1478
01:24:04.421 --> 01:24:07.840
I'm not a fan of tobacco.
I was a cigarette smoker for a few years.
You were?
Yeah,

1479
01:24:07.860 --> 01:24:10.830
maybe like five years or six years.
How long ago was this?
Um,

1480
01:24:10.831 --> 01:24:14.830
I probably quit about a 12 or 13 years ago.
Um,

1481
01:24:15.280 --> 01:24:17.020
so I think I smoked from like,
you know,

1482
01:24:17.230 --> 01:24:21.850
college and then a few years after the nicotine though nicotine as a drug,

1483
01:24:22.070 --> 01:24:26.230
it does have some sort of a benefit or some sort of a promotion of cognitive

1484
01:24:26.231 --> 01:24:30.010
function.
It's glutamate receptors.
It's,
it affects learning in some ways.

1485
01:24:30.011 --> 01:24:32.730
We think a Sri Seal Coleen receptors,
um,
uh,

1486
01:24:32.800 --> 01:24:37.000
we think it's absolutely a effecting learning in some way.
Um,

1487
01:24:37.720 --> 01:24:42.670
but nicotine of course is fairly addictive and nicotine is also carcinogenic all

1488
01:24:42.730 --> 01:24:47.280
by itself,
all by itself.
Even though it's,
it has so much better.
Yeah.

1489
01:24:47.410 --> 01:24:50.440
Much less salt,
carcinogenic than like tobacco,
tobacco,

1490
01:24:50.640 --> 01:24:54.190
but nicotine even by itself.
How some carcinogenic properties,

1491
01:24:54.220 --> 01:24:59.110
but you see the carcinogenic effects or the,
the,
the,
the people that have,
uh,

1492
01:24:59.320 --> 01:25:01.150
an issue with cigarette smoking,

1493
01:25:01.510 --> 01:25:06.250
it's far more likely to cause cancer that it is people that are using like say

1494
01:25:06.251 --> 01:25:10.530
like cigars most because they aren't getting the dosages.
Yeah.
That what it is.

1495
01:25:10.660 --> 01:25:13.930
Yeah.
People that have that use cigars are much more likely to have oral cancers.

1496
01:25:14.240 --> 01:25:16.240
People that smoke have lung cancers,

1497
01:25:17.140 --> 01:25:19.840
but it would have the numbers on cigar smoking.

1498
01:25:19.841 --> 01:25:24.430
Cause what I understand with what I've read is it's fairly uncommon for people

1499
01:25:24.431 --> 01:25:26.710
who are regular cigar smokers to get mouth cancer.

1500
01:25:26.711 --> 01:25:30.990
Like you might have to be one of those wacky George Burns type characters.

1501
01:25:31.050 --> 01:25:33.150
He's always carrying one around.
Yeah.
I'm not sure.
I'm not sure.

1502
01:25:33.160 --> 01:25:37.220
I mean I think you're right.
I just think that as a class,
like,
you know,
what's,

1503
01:25:37.270 --> 01:25:40.050
what's the benefit is minimum.
Again,
some,
some,
uh,
some,
uh,

1504
01:25:40.090 --> 01:25:41.680
some benefits to learning and cognition.

1505
01:25:41.681 --> 01:25:45.220
But you can get those same benefits by getting a good night's sleep really,

1506
01:25:45.430 --> 01:25:49.110
or by,
you know,
meditating.
Um,

1507
01:25:49.180 --> 01:25:52.150
so friends that are writers that are cigarette smokers and they say there's

1508
01:25:52.151 --> 01:25:54.480
nothing like it.
Like Tony Hinchcliffe it,

1509
01:25:54.481 --> 01:25:57.130
he just can't get off the cigarettes when he's writing.

1510
01:25:57.131 --> 01:26:01.690
Like he wrote for the Justin Bieber roast recently and he said when he's in a

1511
01:26:01.691 --> 01:26:04.700
writer's room and he starts firing up the cigarettes,

1512
01:26:04.701 --> 01:26:06.980
the idea is just start flowing.
Sure.
And you know,

1513
01:26:06.981 --> 01:26:09.770
is that state dependent learning?
Cause that's when he always writes.
It could be.

1514
01:26:09.771 --> 01:26:12.200
Right.
I'm also,
you know,
the sank we said for alcohol.
How many,

1515
01:26:12.201 --> 01:26:15.650
how many writers would say alcohol?
Is there muse?

1516
01:26:16.850 --> 01:26:20.480
A lot.
I mean this is all like,
like the,
the,
the Steinbeck disease,
right?
Anyway,

1517
01:26:20.510 --> 01:26:25.160
yeah.
Hemingway,
this is,
this is really,
I mean,
and is it true?
I don't know.

1518
01:26:25.430 --> 01:26:28.730
Yes,
you can get yourself out of your own way.
You can get some,
you know,
some,

1519
01:26:28.760 --> 01:26:31.400
some chemical support and start being creative.

1520
01:26:31.790 --> 01:26:35.720
But is it really helping you to be generative and new ideas or is it just

1521
01:26:35.721 --> 01:26:39.440
helping you not be stressed or is it simply that you've associated being

1522
01:26:39.441 --> 01:26:43.370
creative with drinking?
Well,
I know marijuana,
there's no doubt about it.

1523
01:26:43.430 --> 01:26:44.480
It's a little bit different.
Yeah.

1524
01:26:44.570 --> 01:26:48.890
That's giving you some ideas that just don't exist other than in the marijuana

1525
01:26:48.891 --> 01:26:52.580
state and they might not be good ideas.
Yeah,
like they are,

1526
01:26:52.581 --> 01:26:55.460
but when you're so they sound great when you're,
oh my God,

1527
01:26:55.461 --> 01:26:58.370
I just discovered everything and then later on you're like,

1528
01:26:58.430 --> 01:27:02.330
what the hell was I thinking?
That doesn't,
is that all?
I thought,

1529
01:27:02.331 --> 01:27:03.620
well that's not as exciting as I thought.

1530
01:27:03.680 --> 01:27:07.610
It's also he tried to like read what you wrote down and you're like,

1531
01:27:07.640 --> 01:27:11.120
I used to have a joke about it.
How does it go?
Then I wrote down,

1532
01:27:11.310 --> 01:27:14.180
actually wrote this down,
the Unicorns,
a donkey from the future.

1533
01:27:14.510 --> 01:27:17.120
I wrote that down on paper.
I'm like,
what the fuck is wrong with me?

1534
01:27:17.390 --> 01:27:21.740
Like just shows you like,
that doesn't make any sense.
But when I was high,

1535
01:27:21.741 --> 01:27:24.920
I was like,
this is a whole area.
If your audience was high,

1536
01:27:25.340 --> 01:27:27.710
even if there were a high,
they'd be like,
um,

1537
01:27:27.740 --> 01:27:31.120
what a unicorn is a donkey from the future.
It doesn't make any sense.

1538
01:27:31.200 --> 01:27:32.750
I'm not really,
yeah,
it's ridiculous.

1539
01:27:33.080 --> 01:27:38.080
But there's something that happens when you do smoke marijuana that does excite

1540
01:27:38.511 --> 01:27:43.280
the creative aspect of,
of consciousness.
Sure.
Whatever that is,
whatever that is.

1541
01:27:43.281 --> 01:27:45.220
And you know,
we'd have get our bad,
we didn't get,

1542
01:27:45.230 --> 01:27:46.820
don't know everything cannabis is doing.

1543
01:27:46.821 --> 01:27:51.080
It's not simply one doesn't say THC or the 11 form from,
you know,

1544
01:27:51.110 --> 01:27:51.943
liver format.

1545
01:27:52.340 --> 01:27:55.880
There's like 700 different psychoactive compounds and the burning plant.
Right.

1546
01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:59.630
And they did,
they differ depending on the strain dramatically.
Sometimes.
I mean,

1547
01:27:59.631 --> 01:28:02.790
sativa and indigo are not the same play it,
you know.
Yeah.

1548
01:28:02.870 --> 01:28:07.160
They came from very different sort of,
you know,
genetic trees,
if you will.
Sure.

1549
01:28:07.161 --> 01:28:12.161
One being the of the South American variety of one being one of an intensely

1550
01:28:12.591 --> 01:28:14.390
tropical climates.
Yeah.

1551
01:28:14.450 --> 01:28:18.560
And they have sewing so they have different benefits and you know,
so,
uh,
I mean,

1552
01:28:18.561 --> 01:28:19.371
I don't think we yet know,

1553
01:28:19.371 --> 01:28:22.940
and I'm kind of excited by what's happening with the medical and recreational

1554
01:28:22.941 --> 01:28:26.120
cannabis in this country because we're finally doing some of the research.

1555
01:28:26.450 --> 01:28:29.330
We're finding,
looking into constituent components,

1556
01:28:29.331 --> 01:28:32.740
all the other cannabinoids to be on THC.
Um,

1557
01:28:32.780 --> 01:28:36.440
we're starting to examine the endo cannabinoid and we have a cannabinoid system

1558
01:28:36.441 --> 01:28:40.040
built in.
Um,
there's a neurotransmitter called a Nanda.
You know,

1559
01:28:40.041 --> 01:28:45.041
the Sanskrit word for bliss that hits our endocannabinoid systems and

1560
01:28:45.650 --> 01:28:49.610
[inaudible] that's what the [inaudible] does.
Yeah,
yeah,
that's fascinating.

1561
01:28:49.730 --> 01:28:51.920
And we have a,
you know,
we found the car,

1562
01:28:52.010 --> 01:28:56.440
we found the receptor in the body before we found the,
um,

1563
01:28:56.480 --> 01:28:58.850
the ligature,
the binding compound in the body.

1564
01:28:59.420 --> 01:29:03.960
But we knew that this thing in this receptor in the body existed and cannabis

1565
01:29:03.961 --> 01:29:07.680
bound to it.
And so this receptor that was,

1566
01:29:07.681 --> 01:29:09.450
this developed from the,
the,

1567
01:29:09.451 --> 01:29:13.530
the human body growing up or evolving with the use of this,

1568
01:29:13.880 --> 01:29:17.790
this plant is that,
that's just inherently part of our system.

1569
01:29:17.791 --> 01:29:19.920
I think it's inherently part of our system.
I mean,
you know,

1570
01:29:20.460 --> 01:29:25.460
evolution is tension tends to reinvent the same thing and tended to conserve

1571
01:29:25.471 --> 01:29:30.180
biological constructs,
molecules,
Oregon systems across species.

1572
01:29:30.480 --> 01:29:35.160
So like,
you know,
a mouse has a heart,
so does a human.
They also have,

1573
01:29:35.220 --> 01:29:39.870
uh,
endogenous cannabinoid systems.
Um,

1574
01:29:40.260 --> 01:29:43.890
I think we have to at least two categories of cannabinoid systems.

1575
01:29:43.891 --> 01:29:47.010
One is immune and one is bliss.

1576
01:29:47.880 --> 01:29:52.830
And we know a,
an exogenous,
a,
a plant that affects the blitz system,
you know,

1577
01:29:52.831 --> 01:29:54.390
cannabis,
um,

1578
01:29:55.010 --> 01:29:58.740
economic area affects the other cannabinoid system.
I as a,

1579
01:29:58.790 --> 01:30:02.620
an herb that boosts your immune system and is it really worked to boost your

1580
01:30:02.621 --> 01:30:05.040
immune system?
I think it does.
Yeah.
I mean,
I certainly have taken it.

1581
01:30:05.400 --> 01:30:08.250
If you take it when you're just starting to get sick,

1582
01:30:08.280 --> 01:30:11.190
it can shut down and illness in my experience.
Really?
Yeah.

1583
01:30:11.520 --> 01:30:14.190
And always wondered whether or not that was legit.
I think it is.

1584
01:30:14.191 --> 01:30:17.260
I don't think it's as dramatic as,
you know,
a biotics or anything.
Um,

1585
01:30:17.310 --> 01:30:20.190
but I do think there's some,
there's something there,
but you know,
this,
this,

1586
01:30:20.191 --> 01:30:24.930
this plant,
this purple coneflower I can,
Aisha plant is a cannabinoid.
Uh,

1587
01:30:24.931 --> 01:30:26.850
you know,
it affects your Canab annoyed system.

1588
01:30:26.851 --> 01:30:30.830
That's how it affects your immune system.
That's amazing.
Uh,

1589
01:30:30.900 --> 01:30:34.500
what about CBDS,
CBDS and relationship to cancer,

1590
01:30:34.501 --> 01:30:38.580
which is something that is being researched quite a bit lately.
Yeah.

1591
01:30:38.581 --> 01:30:40.080
I am not up on all the research,

1592
01:30:40.081 --> 01:30:43.710
some of the first papers or the past couple of decades where all CBD,
CBD,
CBD,

1593
01:30:43.711 --> 01:30:46.680
you know,
reducing inflammation,
reducing cancer,
killing cancer cells.

1594
01:30:46.980 --> 01:30:51.980
I've seen a few papers recently that say the non CBD compounds also do that and

1595
01:30:52.381 --> 01:30:55.710
do it better.
Wow.
Nanci like THC has,

1596
01:30:55.740 --> 01:30:59.780
has anticancer properties and do it better than CBD.
It May.
Yeah.

1597
01:30:59.910 --> 01:31:04.020
CBDS being good for inflammation,
joint pain,
things along those lines.

1598
01:31:04.021 --> 01:31:09.021
The paper I read had THC also working on all those other aspects as well.

1599
01:31:09.210 --> 01:31:09.781
Wow.

1600
01:31:09.781 --> 01:31:13.980
So the isolation of the CBD might just be because people were trying to avoid

1601
01:31:13.981 --> 01:31:18.810
THC.
Try to avoid the psychoactive.
Yeah.
Cause CBD,
um,

1602
01:31:18.930 --> 01:31:21.510
the ratio active,
it's non psychoactive.
In fact,

1603
01:31:21.511 --> 01:31:26.511
the ratio of CBD to THC effects the House psychoactive something is so too much

1604
01:31:26.521 --> 01:31:31.521
CBD and you aren't gonna get high off your pot even in the presence of THC and

1605
01:31:32.250 --> 01:31:35.520
counteracting counteract each other.
Exactly.
So in inbuilt check,

1606
01:31:35.580 --> 01:31:38.820
is it frustrating to that all this stuff which probably could have been figured

1607
01:31:38.821 --> 01:31:43.740
out a long time ago were legal?
Yeah.
I mean,
it's a little frustrating,

1608
01:31:43.741 --> 01:31:47.820
but I look at,
you know,
if you go back a hundred years ago,

1609
01:31:47.821 --> 01:31:51.360
technology was nowhere compared to where it is right now.

1610
01:31:51.780 --> 01:31:56.220
I sort of see us on the exponential curve,
the hockey stick of acceleration now.

1611
01:31:56.221 --> 01:32:00.370
So would it have been nice if 50 years ago we were getting into this stuff?
Sure.

1612
01:32:00.790 --> 01:32:02.070
<v 2>But it doesn't on a,
on a,</v>

1613
01:32:02.071 --> 01:32:05.530
on a global timescale doesn't really bother me that it's happening now versus

1614
01:32:05.531 --> 01:32:06.760
last decade.
No.
Well,

1615
01:32:06.761 --> 01:32:09.280
it doesn't bother me that it's happening now and what bothers me is the

1616
01:32:09.281 --> 01:32:14.281
suppression that exists then they used to exist the same suppression that caused

1617
01:32:14.321 --> 01:32:15.154
this,

1618
01:32:15.700 --> 01:32:20.020
this reluctance of pharmaceutical companies to accept this treatment of epilepsy

1619
01:32:20.021 --> 01:32:22.440
that didn't involve drugs that they sell.

1620
01:32:22.450 --> 01:32:27.400
The initial anti cannabis movement was a textiles.
It's country,
right?

1621
01:32:27.430 --> 01:32:32.190
It was textiles and paper actually.
Yeah.
They didn't want the flax or the,
the,

1622
01:32:32.200 --> 01:32:35.740
the fiber's coming in and supplanting the cotton industry and the fuel

1623
01:32:35.741 --> 01:32:36.520
industries and things.

1624
01:32:36.520 --> 01:32:41.110
It was directly connected to the production and creation of a machine called the

1625
01:32:41.111 --> 01:32:43.090
decorticator.
Decorticator.
Yeah.

1626
01:32:43.091 --> 01:32:47.140
The decorticator was the first time that they developed a system of processing

1627
01:32:47.141 --> 01:32:50.440
hemp fire that didn't involve slavery or hard manual labor.

1628
01:32:50.890 --> 01:32:54.370
The reason why cotton took such a foothold is because they came up with the

1629
01:32:54.371 --> 01:32:58.960
cotton gin,
Eli Whitney and came up with the cotton gin.
Cotton,
uh,

1630
01:32:59.110 --> 01:33:01.400
became much more viable than cannabis.

1631
01:33:01.401 --> 01:33:04.600
Then hemp fibers of hemp are far stronger,

1632
01:33:04.780 --> 01:33:08.890
far superior for the paper and cloth.
It's just way tougher.
Absolutely.

1633
01:33:08.891 --> 01:33:13.330
Like 10 times.
And is,
or something in this canvas comes from the word cannabis.

1634
01:33:13.690 --> 01:33:17.170
Cannabis was originally a hemp product.
Oh,
interesting.

1635
01:33:17.171 --> 01:33:21.280
I knew I didn't are more far more durable,
far more durable for pants.

1636
01:33:21.281 --> 01:33:26.070
The original Levis are made out of canvas.
It was all cannabis.
Interesting.
Yeah.

1637
01:33:26.080 --> 01:33:31.080
It's all hemp based until that motherfucker that they made that book or they

1638
01:33:31.541 --> 01:33:35.260
made the movie reefer madness.
No,
it wasn't that.
It was,
uh,

1639
01:33:35.320 --> 01:33:39.760
it was a William Randolph Hearst,
Orson Welles movie citizen Kane.

1640
01:33:40.360 --> 01:33:42.340
That was all about this one asshole.
Right.

1641
01:33:42.490 --> 01:33:46.850
William Randolph Hearst owned Hearst enterprises.
He owned,
you know,

1642
01:33:46.900 --> 01:33:48.700
all the newspapers he owned.
I mean,

1643
01:33:48.701 --> 01:33:51.900
he just had this massive stranglehold on information.
Yeah.

1644
01:33:52.060 --> 01:33:56.920
And he was a motherfucker and this guy came out with the idea of,

1645
01:33:56.921 --> 01:34:01.720
first of all,
they've got in cahoots with Harry Anslinger and uh,
they,

1646
01:34:01.750 --> 01:34:04.180
they decided to call it marijuana,

1647
01:34:04.240 --> 01:34:08.710
which wasn't a name for it before marijuana was the name for a wild Mexican

1648
01:34:08.711 --> 01:34:11.830
tobacco plant.
That wasn't even,
it wasn't even cannabis.

1649
01:34:12.010 --> 01:34:15.400
So when Congress was outlawing marijuana,

1650
01:34:15.430 --> 01:34:20.050
they didn't exactly understand that they were outlawing hemp as a textile and as

1651
01:34:20.051 --> 01:34:21.190
a commodity.
Interesting.

1652
01:34:21.250 --> 01:34:25.360
So then you had to get like a tax stamp in order to grow hemp and then,

1653
01:34:26.020 --> 01:34:29.560
you know,
they needed it for World War II.
So they started this campaign,

1654
01:34:29.561 --> 01:34:34.450
hemp for victory and hemp for victory was this famous video that they,

1655
01:34:34.451 --> 01:34:37.130
uh,
that Jack,
uh,
hair,

1656
01:34:37.180 --> 01:34:40.930
who was a famous famous marijuana activist,

1657
01:34:41.170 --> 01:34:46.170
found this video to sort of sort of establish what he had been saying all along.

1658
01:34:47.920 --> 01:34:48.281
Like,
look,

1659
01:34:48.281 --> 01:34:53.281
this is something that we had grown and used as a culture for thousands of

1660
01:34:53.800 --> 01:34:56.890
years.
Human beings,
it's,
it's,
it was a huge part.

1661
01:34:57.500 --> 01:35:01.370
I mean it was what George W are,
George Herbert Walker Bush.

1662
01:35:01.400 --> 01:35:05.210
That was what his parachute was made of when he parachuted to safety in World

1663
01:35:05.210 --> 01:35:08.780
War II.
It was what the sales that Columbus sailed on was made out of.

1664
01:35:08.781 --> 01:35:11.960
They were all made out of hemp.
Yup.
Okay.
Yeah.
All of it.
Rope.

1665
01:35:12.230 --> 01:35:14.390
And when they decided to demonize it,

1666
01:35:14.391 --> 01:35:17.360
the way they did it was to go after racism.

1667
01:35:17.390 --> 01:35:22.100
They said this marijuana plant I was making blacks and Mexicans rape white
women.

1668
01:35:22.160 --> 01:35:25.460
Right.
Everybody went fucking crazy.
Yeah.
Well,
you know,
fear,

1669
01:35:25.461 --> 01:35:28.130
uncertainty and doubt and marketing has even sort of,
you know,

1670
01:35:28.131 --> 01:35:30.140
a big player back then and nowadays you can,

1671
01:35:30.141 --> 01:35:32.670
it's hard to get good information about anything without,
you know,

1672
01:35:32.930 --> 01:35:36.320
a decent degree to understand what the noise,
where the noises shoring from.

1673
01:35:36.350 --> 01:35:36.861
But it's,

1674
01:35:36.861 --> 01:35:41.861
in a lot of ways it's very similar to what you're saying about taking away this

1675
01:35:42.240 --> 01:35:46.290
non drug option of treating epilepsy.
Yeah.

1676
01:35:46.490 --> 01:35:48.260
It's like they realize,
okay,

1677
01:35:48.261 --> 01:35:52.490
there's money to be made with this one solution,
this new solution.

1678
01:35:52.491 --> 01:35:56.750
There's no money to be made.
Let's attack it.
Yeah.
That's what they did.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1679
01:35:56.751 --> 01:35:57.200
I mean there's,

1680
01:35:57.200 --> 01:36:02.200
there's people making CBD or CBN only strains of cannabis purely for epileptic

1681
01:36:02.931 --> 01:36:05.360
epileptics.
Now that they suppress seizures.
I mean,

1682
01:36:05.480 --> 01:36:08.930
you don't want to give a five year old kid a joint,
you know,

1683
01:36:08.931 --> 01:36:11.060
they're already pretty stoned as a five year old.
Right.

1684
01:36:11.390 --> 01:36:16.040
But CBN or CBD can suppress,
uh,
epileptic activity.
You know,

1685
01:36:16.041 --> 01:36:20.590
where is,
I mean that's a charged issue of giving a kid cannabis,
but,
uh,

1686
01:36:20.591 --> 01:36:23.480
I don't see any ethical or are problematic,
uh,
you know,

1687
01:36:23.740 --> 01:36:28.280
use even with children if you're using it as an antiepileptic epileptic

1688
01:36:28.310 --> 01:36:29.210
intervention.
Well,

1689
01:36:29.211 --> 01:36:32.600
I have direct experience with a very good friend of mine who has a child who has

1690
01:36:32.601 --> 01:36:34.460
extreme epileptic seizures.
He gives,

1691
01:36:34.480 --> 01:36:37.970
he gives a kid medical cannabis now he moved to a state where it's legal and

1692
01:36:37.971 --> 01:36:42.320
moved to Washington state and he gives his kid a very small amount every day and

1693
01:36:42.321 --> 01:36:44.210
there's no law,
no longer any seizures.

1694
01:36:44.530 --> 01:36:48.650
His kid was having multiple seizures a day.
He was more,
he's also got,

1695
01:36:48.651 --> 01:36:52.580
he's on the autism spectrum.
It's also got like some pretty severe social issues,

1696
01:36:52.970 --> 01:36:57.320
which were mitigated substantially once he started.
Okay.
Interesting.
Interesting.

1697
01:36:57.380 --> 01:37:01.580
But there's all sorts of other connections to gut bacteria and there's a bunch

1698
01:37:01.581 --> 01:37:05.900
of inflammation issues,
diet and things that change that for,

1699
01:37:06.140 --> 01:37:08.840
for kids who suffer from these things,
if they don't feel totally,

1700
01:37:08.841 --> 01:37:11.090
truly understand and we may never,

1701
01:37:11.091 --> 01:37:12.800
cause I mean every individual little bit different too.

1702
01:37:12.800 --> 01:37:15.620
I mean it's what autism specifically is not really one thing.

1703
01:37:15.621 --> 01:37:18.080
It's more like the autism.
Um,

1704
01:37:18.110 --> 01:37:21.440
the only thing consistent across them as the social deficits.

1705
01:37:21.470 --> 01:37:25.740
But you can have a high functioning asbergers individual with you know,

1706
01:37:25.790 --> 01:37:29.930
superior cognitive skills,
incredible abilities,

1707
01:37:30.350 --> 01:37:32.330
but still some deficits in other areas.

1708
01:37:32.840 --> 01:37:37.840
And it's so they're so concerned with opening up the doorway to this stuff that

1709
01:37:38.151 --> 01:37:41.730
even non-psychoactive versions of these plants are illegal.
Right?

1710
01:37:41.810 --> 01:37:46.220
Like hemp is when we have a huge issue with that at on it.
My supplement company,

1711
01:37:46.221 --> 01:37:50.070
because we sell protein,
hemp protein is very bioavailable,

1712
01:37:50.090 --> 01:37:53.600
but we have to get it from Canada.
Right?
Cause we can't you,
you can,

1713
01:37:53.630 --> 01:37:57.030
you sort of can grow with the states in that law.

1714
01:37:57.031 --> 01:38:02.031
Just change like last week then you can now start growing commercial hemp sorta.

1715
01:38:02.370 --> 01:38:05.580
You wouldn't know more sort of has,
it sort of has,

1716
01:38:05.581 --> 01:38:07.740
but it's got a lot of resistance.
It's got a raise,

1717
01:38:07.790 --> 01:38:12.790
a lot of resistance in terms of how it's going to react or how the federal

1718
01:38:13.651 --> 01:38:14.910
government is going to react to it.

1719
01:38:14.940 --> 01:38:19.260
If a Republican gets in office in 2016 that's also one of the things about

1720
01:38:19.261 --> 01:38:20.650
medical marijuana,
like the,

1721
01:38:20.651 --> 01:38:24.150
they've recently soften their stance considerably on medical marijuana,

1722
01:38:24.151 --> 01:38:25.800
but all it takes is like one thing,

1723
01:38:26.130 --> 01:38:30.210
one Jeb Bush motherfucker to get into office and things can get really weird.

1724
01:38:30.330 --> 01:38:33.670
But as of right now,
we have to get our stuff from Canada interest.

1725
01:38:33.710 --> 01:38:37.170
We would love to buy it from America,
from America farmers and,

1726
01:38:37.171 --> 01:38:40.110
but also it's just should be something that people could,
it's,
it's a plant,

1727
01:38:40.590 --> 01:38:42.830
it's ridic.
It does not killing anybody and it's a plan.

1728
01:38:42.831 --> 01:38:45.050
It should be really that simple.
Whereas he tell anybody,
no.

1729
01:38:45.250 --> 01:38:48.810
Is it 20 people in the slaves?
Bren was invented today.

1730
01:38:48.811 --> 01:38:51.570
If Astro was about to today,
aspirin will be a scheduled substance.

1731
01:38:52.200 --> 01:38:55.590
That's a controlled substance.
It probably would.
Right?
It has side effects.

1732
01:38:55.591 --> 01:38:58.410
It can kill you.
Sure.
Yeah.
And not only that,

1733
01:38:58.440 --> 01:39:00.330
there's a lot of medications that they prescribed,

1734
01:39:00.360 --> 01:39:04.110
especially for people that have heart disease or aspirin.

1735
01:39:04.111 --> 01:39:08.010
Can just know that shit right in the bud.
Aspirin is an amazing,

1736
01:39:08.340 --> 01:39:10.650
amazing anti-inflammatory.
Oh yeah,
absolutely.

1737
01:39:10.651 --> 01:39:15.060
I think it's at least initially for the natural,
uh,
you know,
willow bark.
Yeah.

1738
01:39:15.280 --> 01:39:18.270
Can you,
can you get it in a natural form still?
Is it available?

1739
01:39:18.271 --> 01:39:22.050
Can you got in the forest and you know,
the inner bark of a white willow tree,

1740
01:39:22.350 --> 01:39:26.040
that's all it is to it.
And then you'll get a seat.
A Cila salic acid.
Yeah.
Wow.

1741
01:39:26.100 --> 01:39:28.560
And how will you know how much barked at shoe?
Um,

1742
01:39:28.561 --> 01:39:30.760
I don't think the dosages are an issue when it,
you know,

1743
01:39:30.840 --> 01:39:32.820
I think you'll absorb it and get pain relief or whatever.

1744
01:39:32.850 --> 01:39:36.130
So it's only when you swallow it,
but it becomes an issue.
No,
I think it's,

1745
01:39:36.131 --> 01:39:38.130
it's being absorbed through the Mucosa,

1746
01:39:38.131 --> 01:39:41.700
but I don't think you're going to get concentrated doses the way doing tablets

1747
01:39:41.701 --> 01:39:45.300
of aspirin.
Yeah,
that's what I mean.
So you can overdose on the tablets.

1748
01:39:45.301 --> 01:39:47.970
You can't overdose on chewing the bark.
You probably can,

1749
01:39:48.030 --> 01:39:51.090
but you'd have to be an asshole asshole.
And it probably tastes like ass.

1750
01:39:51.360 --> 01:39:53.880
I mean it's the,
these are very bitter substances.
So how did it,

1751
01:39:53.881 --> 01:39:56.940
everybody ever find out that that gives you a relief from a headache?

1752
01:39:56.970 --> 01:40:00.000
I don't know.
Probably some,
you know,
drew it,
bring it in tea or something,

1753
01:40:00.001 --> 01:40:02.430
you know,
a couple of years ago.
Yeah,
it's a,

1754
01:40:02.910 --> 01:40:06.710
it's an interesting thing that that's been around for so long and there's so,

1755
01:40:06.720 --> 01:40:10.620
and it's sort of like very subtly swept under the rug.

1756
01:40:10.710 --> 01:40:13.860
The health benefits of aspirin.
Sure,
sure.
Well,
you know,
in,

1757
01:40:13.861 --> 01:40:15.450
at least in the cardiac medicine,

1758
01:40:15.680 --> 01:40:19.730
there's still this focus of giving people the heart risks,
uh,

1759
01:40:19.830 --> 01:40:22.080
or heart cardiac risk of heart attack,
you know,

1760
01:40:22.770 --> 01:40:26.580
prophylactic doses of aspirin every day to reduce the strain on the blood
system.

1761
01:40:26.581 --> 01:40:30.360
And well,
I've also heard people say that after you get to a certain age,

1762
01:40:30.361 --> 01:40:33.570
you should just take aspirin any day every day anyway just to mitigate the

1763
01:40:33.571 --> 01:40:37.620
natural reaction that your body has to inflammation or,
or the,
or the clotting.

1764
01:40:37.680 --> 01:40:39.580
It's really not clotting.
Um,
and I think,
you know,

1765
01:40:39.940 --> 01:40:43.920
tam is a better drug for that long term that aspirin because it has other

1766
01:40:43.921 --> 01:40:45.180
benefits.
That's interesting.

1767
01:40:45.181 --> 01:40:48.750
I wanted to bring those up to different nootropics like Prasad,
Tim,

1768
01:40:48.780 --> 01:40:50.340
the different racetams.

1769
01:40:51.110 --> 01:40:53.980
What are your favorite ones when it comes to nootropics and

1770
01:40:53.980 --> 01:40:58.720
<v 0>what,
what,
what causes you to prefer those?
Well,
you know,
I'm a,</v>

1771
01:40:58.721 --> 01:41:00.400
I'm the one of the scientists that true brain,

1772
01:41:00.401 --> 01:41:03.040
so I help in true brain is that you have it right here?
It's a yeah,

1773
01:41:03.041 --> 01:41:06.880
we'd be about to send you a tropic drink.
Yeah,
we have drinks and capsule form.

1774
01:41:06.910 --> 01:41:11.650
Uh,
and the drinks,
um,
sort of are the first to market.
Little little mini drinks.

1775
01:41:11.680 --> 01:41:14.590
Uh,
so you got three different colors here.
Three different colors,

1776
01:41:14.591 --> 01:41:17.770
blue and orange.
Why,
why is it that,
well,
once caffeinated,

1777
01:41:18.250 --> 01:41:22.120
which one it should say on it?
It's the blue or the green.
You don't know.

1778
01:41:22.420 --> 01:41:24.980
I forget.
This is your shit man.
I know.
Well we,
we,
we,

1779
01:41:24.990 --> 01:41:26.880
we keep iterating and changing it.
So this is the,

1780
01:41:26.920 --> 01:41:30.010
this is the latest flavor we've ever come up with.
Okay.
This is caffeine free.

1781
01:41:30.070 --> 01:41:32.520
The blue one.
The green one's caffeinated then.
Okay.

1782
01:41:32.620 --> 01:41:34.210
And the orange one is the boost.

1783
01:41:34.211 --> 01:41:38.110
So the blue and the green ones are paroxetine based with CDP.
Coleen.

1784
01:41:38.260 --> 01:41:41.260
This is the original.
Yup.
Greens,
the Greens.

1785
01:41:41.261 --> 01:41:44.230
The caffeinated one has 80 milligrams of caffeine,
not a huge amount.

1786
01:41:44.680 --> 01:41:49.330
And then the orange one is oxy Rasta.
Tam based 80 milligrams is not a lot.
No,

1787
01:41:49.450 --> 01:41:51.700
that's like a cup of coffee though.
Um,

1788
01:41:51.730 --> 01:41:55.390
it's like a four ounce cup of coffee of drip coffee.
Isn't that though,

1789
01:41:55.391 --> 01:41:59.490
but like aren't we considering that because of like how jacked up Starbucks is

1790
01:41:59.680 --> 01:42:03.880
because Starbucks is a,
venti is 200 milligrams of caffeine more than that,

1791
01:42:04.140 --> 01:42:06.100
isn't it?
Late?
Yeah.
Yeah,
yeah.

1792
01:42:06.101 --> 01:42:10.140
Caffeine somewhere between 75 and 150 milligrams,
um,

1793
01:42:10.300 --> 01:42:13.450
for every eight ounces of drip or one espresso shot.

1794
01:42:13.660 --> 01:42:17.050
So it takes three espresso shots to equal the amount of caffeine in a 12 ounce

1795
01:42:17.051 --> 01:42:17.884
drip coffee.

1796
01:42:18.020 --> 01:42:20.800
That's a lot of people think that espresso is much stronger and the darker you

1797
01:42:20.801 --> 01:42:23.250
rose,
the less caffeine you have in the bean.
Right?

1798
01:42:23.260 --> 01:42:25.770
So that's another thing that's a misconception,
right?
People Think,
oh,

1799
01:42:25.780 --> 01:42:27.740
give me the dark roast.
Want to get fucked up?
No,

1800
01:42:27.800 --> 01:42:31.630
a French toast is like up to a third less caffeine than a light roast.

1801
01:42:31.660 --> 01:42:32.493
What do you got there,
Jamie?

1802
01:42:33.940 --> 01:42:38.860
450 milligrams from a 20 from a,
is that Starbucks?

1803
01:42:38.960 --> 01:42:43.900
Yeah.
Was that by Dean one 81 80 is a short,

1804
01:42:43.930 --> 01:42:48.220
that's what I was thinking of.
So between as short a tall,

1805
01:42:48.630 --> 01:42:50.800
tall,
tall is their middle right.
And then grow.

1806
01:42:50.801 --> 01:42:54.730
I fucking hate all these foreign words.
God dammit.

1807
01:42:54.760 --> 01:42:57.640
Don't call it a grand day.
Caught a medium.
Well there's,

1808
01:42:57.680 --> 01:42:59.410
there's lots of reasons to boycott these guys.

1809
01:42:59.411 --> 01:43:02.420
Now they just went after the state of Vermont.
Uh,

1810
01:43:02.500 --> 01:43:07.030
Starbucks and Monsanto joined together to file suit against Vermont for

1811
01:43:07.060 --> 01:43:09.730
mandating labeling of Gmos.
What?

1812
01:43:10.720 --> 01:43:15.580
Starbucks and Monsanto?
They have GMO coffee.
No,
they just wanted,

1813
01:43:15.850 --> 01:43:19.780
they don't want to be mandated to label one of them.
Well if there's an issue,

1814
01:43:19.810 --> 01:43:22.120
is there an issue with Gmos with that?

1815
01:43:22.600 --> 01:43:26.200
There's an immediate d modification knee jerk.
Yeah.

1816
01:43:26.560 --> 01:43:29.570
When people don't understand that every fucking tomato you buy at grocery
stores,

1817
01:43:29.590 --> 01:43:32.680
genetic grandma's,
no such thing as a non GMO cow.

1818
01:43:32.950 --> 01:43:36.910
There's no such thing as a non GMO ear of corn.
If you're eating ears of corn.

1819
01:43:36.911 --> 01:43:39.610
That shit has been modified.
Corn has been heavily modified.

1820
01:43:39.720 --> 01:43:41.650
We recently in the past 10 20 years,

1821
01:43:41.651 --> 01:43:46.060
but we've been GMO in cattle with selective reading for thousands of years.

1822
01:43:46.300 --> 01:43:46.571
Right.

1823
01:43:46.571 --> 01:43:51.571
But isn't there a difference between selective breeding and splicing in native

1824
01:43:51.921 --> 01:43:52.580
genetics,

1825
01:43:52.580 --> 01:43:57.110
<v 2>which they have done to increase the probably a difference resistance to certain</v>

1826
01:43:57.111 --> 01:44:01.580
pesticides.
Roundup freaks people out at least so.
Right,
totally.
Yeah,

1827
01:44:01.581 --> 01:44:04.550
absolutely.
This isn't one of those things where there's not an either or.

1828
01:44:04.580 --> 01:44:08.480
There's there's,
there's benefits to genetically modify things to our advantage,

1829
01:44:08.481 --> 01:44:11.270
but there's also cost greed and,

1830
01:44:11.300 --> 01:44:16.300
and also when people don't want to address the actual real health concerns of

1831
01:44:16.551 --> 01:44:19.170
their creations,
and that's what people were worried about.

1832
01:44:19.190 --> 01:44:24.190
That's why when Brazil as a country filed suit against Monsanto one,

1833
01:44:24.990 --> 01:44:27.010
yeah,
I mean farmers,

1834
01:44:27.050 --> 01:44:32.050
Brazilian farmers to join together and file this gigantic suit within.

1835
01:44:32.430 --> 01:44:36.290
There's an Indian farmers that they have this huge issue where they,
they,

1836
01:44:36.291 --> 01:44:39.950
they get leased out these seeds and then they,

1837
01:44:39.951 --> 01:44:43.370
they're in debt and they wound up committing suicide.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

1838
01:44:43.371 --> 01:44:45.950
I heard that article recently.
God,
it's,
it's staggering.

1839
01:44:46.200 --> 01:44:50.810
If you let the old sharecropping model where you,
you know,
rent the land,

1840
01:44:50.811 --> 01:44:54.140
sell the sea and sell the tools and you know,

1841
01:44:54.141 --> 01:44:57.570
now you must work for me for the next 60 years to make back your money.
Yeah.

1842
01:44:57.571 --> 01:45:01.860
And Monsanto is the one who's profiting off of it and just assessed just to,

1843
01:45:02.810 --> 01:45:07.810
what's this Monsanto Latte tell Starbucks to serve only organic non GMO milk.

1844
01:45:09.440 --> 01:45:10.011
True.

1845
01:45:10.011 --> 01:45:13.550
Starbucks is a member of the Grocery Manufacturers Association with challenging

1846
01:45:13.551 --> 01:45:16.580
Vermont over GMO labeling requirements.
False.

1847
01:45:16.581 --> 01:45:19.700
Starbucks has joined forces with Monsanto.
Ty was fooled.

1848
01:45:19.760 --> 01:45:24.500
How dare you know I was full air.
You Dr. Hill of dare.
You're one of those guys.

1849
01:45:24.501 --> 01:45:25.640
I just want to say shit.

1850
01:45:25.641 --> 01:45:29.260
You find Starbucks is not a part of Monsanto's GMO lawsuit.

1851
01:45:29.270 --> 01:45:32.000
This is from Starbucks or stop food labeling.
All right,

1852
01:45:32.001 --> 01:45:36.350
well now we know that was from 2014 sir.
How dare you.

1853
01:45:36.380 --> 01:45:41.060
I read an article recently that seem legit,
so was it in the onion?
No,
no,

1854
01:45:41.270 --> 01:45:45.050
no.
It seemed legit.
It was written in English,
right?
It was on the Internet.

1855
01:45:45.180 --> 01:45:48.050
The Fox walks.
That's the bar for some people.
Yeah.
Some people,

1856
01:45:48.110 --> 01:45:52.550
well there's a lot of demean.
There's websites now that we'll just write stories.

1857
01:45:52.580 --> 01:45:56.960
They don't even pretend that they're writing something that isn't like,

1858
01:45:57.020 --> 01:45:59.370
it's not even funny.
Like it's the,

1859
01:45:59.400 --> 01:46:03.130
they don't try to make it seem like a parody.
They just,
it's just there to,

1860
01:46:03.330 --> 01:46:05.570
to light a fire.
Well,
they just,
it's clickbait.

1861
01:46:05.870 --> 01:46:08.240
Clickbait is a huge issue across the board.

1862
01:46:08.630 --> 01:46:11.540
It's a huge issue with sites even than I agree with.

1863
01:46:11.650 --> 01:46:13.970
There's a lot of progressive sites that do it.

1864
01:46:14.300 --> 01:46:18.560
They write these really inflammatory titles and then you read it like,

1865
01:46:18.740 --> 01:46:21.680
I can't stand the,
you know,
and,
and you'll believe what happened next.
It's like,

1866
01:46:21.681 --> 01:46:23.870
no,
I'm not even go there now.
Just leave me alone.

1867
01:46:23.930 --> 01:46:28.160
One of them was about peanut butter and Jelly being racist and I was like,

1868
01:46:28.161 --> 01:46:29.540
cut the foot.
The fuck is this.

1869
01:46:29.630 --> 01:46:32.720
And so of course everybody's tweeting it and retweet it.

1870
01:46:32.960 --> 01:46:35.630
And if you actually read into it,
it's like,

1871
01:46:35.690 --> 01:46:40.690
I think some editor just jazzed up this idea of three meals a day and peanut

1872
01:46:41.871 --> 01:46:44.270
butter and Jelly and you know,
and w w where this,

1873
01:46:44.440 --> 01:46:46.730
where does three meals a day come from?
What does the idea,

1874
01:46:46.940 --> 01:46:49.980
and then someone actually put the,
you know,
the by

1875
01:46:49.980 --> 01:46:53.480
<v 0>line,
is it in fact racist?
Like what the fuck?
And then everybody's,</v>

1876
01:46:53.630 --> 01:46:57.180
they're saying that three meals a day is racist and then you start tweeting.

1877
01:46:57.181 --> 01:46:58.620
It's clickbait.
They fuck.
Yeah.

1878
01:46:59.170 --> 01:47:03.470
And this is just this mad rush to get people to read your shit.
Right.

1879
01:47:03.540 --> 01:47:06.580
In doing so you've sacrificed all credibility.
Yeah.
And,

1880
01:47:06.581 --> 01:47:09.750
and you can be inflammatory about peanuts without being stupid.
I mean,

1881
01:47:09.880 --> 01:47:14.220
peanuts are somewhat dangerous.
Uh,
you know,
people's health potentially.
No.

1882
01:47:14.221 --> 01:47:18.390
Why don't I read about peanuts has said that it wasn't always the case in that

1883
01:47:18.391 --> 01:47:21.810
one of the real concerns about peanut allergies is that keeping kids from

1884
01:47:21.811 --> 01:47:25.230
peanuts when they're very young because you're worried about peanut allergies

1885
01:47:25.260 --> 01:47:27.900
could in fact be causing peanut allergies.
Yeah.

1886
01:47:27.901 --> 01:47:32.901
There was a recently a study that found that by doing a manipulation of gut

1887
01:47:33.481 --> 01:47:37.830
bacteria,
they could eliminate peanut allergies in mice.
Really?
Yeah.

1888
01:47:37.831 --> 01:47:40.810
So it seems to be some core,
uh,
you know,

1889
01:47:40.830 --> 01:47:45.830
functional gut thing that's gone awry to produce peanut allergies in these

1890
01:47:46.531 --> 01:47:51.330
individuals.
This doesn't taste that bad.
Which one's that?
The caffeine one.
Yeah,

1891
01:47:51.360 --> 01:47:54.630
that's the worst one.
That's the most bitter of all three.
Yeah,

1892
01:47:55.230 --> 01:47:58.620
because caffeine is pretty bitter molecule.
Oh,
it is like it has a taste to it.

1893
01:47:58.621 --> 01:48:01.660
Yeah,
yeah,
absolutely.
Yeah.
I try decaf verses CAF coffee and you'll,

1894
01:48:01.680 --> 01:48:05.210
we'll tell the taste,
the differences,
uh,
bitterness under the caffeine.
Caffeine,

1895
01:48:05.230 --> 01:48:08.430
Flint.
Yeah.
There's like a mild or sort of,
what are you thinking about?

1896
01:48:08.440 --> 01:48:12.570
Like you ever try that Kopi Luwak that?
No,
I have not tried it to being,

1897
01:48:12.571 --> 01:48:14.280
that comes from a civics,
but yeah,

1898
01:48:14.281 --> 01:48:18.690
I mean I have a problem paying 70 bucks for a cup of coffee,
first of all.
Uh,

1899
01:48:18.750 --> 01:48:22.680
but um,
I have not yet tried the Kopi Luwak.
Yeah.
Bought a bag of it once.

1900
01:48:23.010 --> 01:48:26.880
Why bonded?
Um,
uh,
at a place and it was really smooth.

1901
01:48:27.270 --> 01:48:28.550
If you haven't heard of it,
what it is,

1902
01:48:28.680 --> 01:48:32.790
there's an animal called a civic that is like some type of cat.
Like a weasel.

1903
01:48:32.810 --> 01:48:33.360
Yeah.

1904
01:48:33.360 --> 01:48:38.010
But I think it's in the cat family and they eat coffee beans and then shit them

1905
01:48:38.011 --> 01:48:38.610
out.

1906
01:48:38.610 --> 01:48:42.120
And the farmers didn't want to waste these coffee beans so they would literally

1907
01:48:42.121 --> 01:48:46.540
pick them out of the Dung of the civic and put it into,
you know,

1908
01:48:46.560 --> 01:48:51.330
there'd broast it and it somehow or another stomach acids do something pre

1909
01:48:51.331 --> 01:48:54.810
digested.
Yeah.
It makes it like really smooth.
Yeah.
All the enzymes.

1910
01:48:54.900 --> 01:48:58.470
But does it affect the caffeine content?
I don't know.
I don't know.

1911
01:48:58.471 --> 01:49:02.190
My guess is the roasting is really where that matters the most because you have

1912
01:49:02.191 --> 01:49:05.960
to bring the oils out of the beam to the surface and caramelize them or oxidized

1913
01:49:05.961 --> 01:49:09.930
and to produce the,
the flavor you're looking for.
So I guess in the long euros,

1914
01:49:10.110 --> 01:49:15.110
the more the caffeine goes down and non roasted coffee beans have some sort of

1915
01:49:15.451 --> 01:49:18.810
antioxidant effect as well,
right?
Yeah.
The green coffee bean health thing,

1916
01:49:19.020 --> 01:49:22.740
the chloro,
what's the word?
Chloro I forget what the compound is.
Yeah.

1917
01:49:22.741 --> 01:49:27.570
But there's some antioxidants,
uh,
in,
I mean green,
Brown,
whatever,
coffee.

1918
01:49:27.571 --> 01:49:30.480
You have Westerners get more antioxidants from coffee.

1919
01:49:30.481 --> 01:49:33.510
I think that all other sources combined,
that's incredible.
You know,

1920
01:49:33.511 --> 01:49:36.600
we drink a huge amount of coffee,
but there's a,
there's a lot of benefits.
I mean,

1921
01:49:36.601 --> 01:49:41.460
I'm a big fan of the coffee.
Uh,
but it gets demonized,
doesn't it?
It sure does.

1922
01:49:41.461 --> 01:49:43.000
I mean,
and there's,
and there's some drawbacks.

1923
01:49:43.030 --> 01:49:45.890
Know coffee would not be considered a strict nootropic.
I mean,
my,

1924
01:49:45.950 --> 01:49:47.890
my definition for the word nootropic is

1925
01:49:48.220 --> 01:49:51.790
<v 2>improving cognition,
supporting output with no appreciable side effects.</v>

1926
01:49:51.791 --> 01:49:55.720
So coffee does not fit.
Doesn't,
doesn't,
it doesn't fit that bar,
but do I use it?

1927
01:49:55.750 --> 01:49:57.370
Absolutely.
I mean,
I wake up in the morning,

1928
01:49:57.371 --> 01:49:58.830
have too much blood in my caffeine stream,

1929
01:49:58.831 --> 01:50:02.440
you and race for the poor over and make one first thing.
Well,
you know,

1930
01:50:02.441 --> 01:50:05.140
I'd love it as a ritual.
It's like one of those things,

1931
01:50:05.141 --> 01:50:09.460
I just love a warm cup of coffee in the morning.
It's just like,

1932
01:50:09.461 --> 01:50:13.030
it feels like this is a nice way to relax your way into the day.
Absolutely.

1933
01:50:13.031 --> 01:50:14.790
And the ritual,
a piece of it should not be,
I mean it's,

1934
01:50:14.791 --> 01:50:16.030
it's a really big part of it for me.

1935
01:50:16.040 --> 01:50:20.260
It gives you a chance to be mindful of when folks come into my office for Qbe,

1936
01:50:20.310 --> 01:50:24.160
Geez,
I asked him to abstain from coffee that day or tea or whatever.

1937
01:50:24.550 --> 01:50:26.570
And then when they're done I hand them a,
you know,

1938
01:50:26.590 --> 01:50:28.900
handcrafted cup of coffee that I've made for that.

1939
01:50:28.901 --> 01:50:32.200
Handcrafted is one of my least favorite expression is,
is it really?
Yup.

1940
01:50:32.290 --> 01:50:35.060
I'm really getting pissed.
Is it,
is it redundant?
Is that the uh,

1941
01:50:35.180 --> 01:50:39.070
it's just one of those things is a handcrafted burger is we won't serve

1942
01:50:39.071 --> 01:50:42.520
handcrafted cocktails.
I make,
I make the coffee from my clients when they're,

1943
01:50:42.521 --> 01:50:43.600
when they're done their brain map.

1944
01:50:43.640 --> 01:50:46.270
The doctor brings you a cup of coffee because it's,

1945
01:50:46.570 --> 01:50:49.330
let me give you some good coffee.
My secret stash.
Oh,
what kinds of,

1946
01:50:49.331 --> 01:50:53.420
what kind of coffee do you,
I use a mix of small origin,
organic,
you know,

1947
01:50:53.440 --> 01:50:56.800
batches I haven't delivered to me from a couple of places in the country.
Yeah.

1948
01:50:56.830 --> 01:51:01.540
So there's a place up in Portland,
Oregon that ships me in my little stash,
so,
oh,

1949
01:51:01.541 --> 01:51:04.880
that's nice.
Okay,
cool.
Um,
yeah,
I have a,

1950
01:51:05.240 --> 01:51:07.360
a bunch of different favorites.
I like the coffees.

1951
01:51:07.361 --> 01:51:10.540
Do have a different flavor profile.
Oh yeah,
sure,
sure,
sure.

1952
01:51:10.750 --> 01:51:13.780
There's some interesting ones out there,
you know.
Um,
I had this guy,

1953
01:51:13.781 --> 01:51:18.610
Peter Giuliani Juliano Juliano Juliano,
he's,
um,

1954
01:51:18.670 --> 01:51:23.140
a coffee expert.
And,
uh,
he told me that all coffee originates from Ethiopia,

1955
01:51:23.200 --> 01:51:24.220
all of it initially,

1956
01:51:25.060 --> 01:51:28.320
and that very narrow part of the world it grew in initially.

1957
01:51:28.860 --> 01:51:32.200
And that from there they started taking it to all these different parts of the

1958
01:51:32.201 --> 01:51:35.980
world where he's like,
Erica or Rebecca Arabic,
how'd he say it?

1959
01:51:36.010 --> 01:51:37.460
Or rabbit or Rebecca beans.

1960
01:51:38.400 --> 01:51:41.410
They took it to Saudi Arabia and they took it to all these different parts of

1961
01:51:41.411 --> 01:51:43.080
South America.
Yeah.

1962
01:51:43.390 --> 01:51:45.280
And then they started growing it and all these different places.

1963
01:51:45.281 --> 01:51:49.060
But we'd always can think of,
you know,
Columbia's being like,
where did that Dude,

1964
01:51:49.061 --> 01:51:52.180
Juan Valdez lives?
I mean,
he's,
he's growing into the awesome coffee.

1965
01:51:52.210 --> 01:51:56.320
I actually prefer African coffees to South America.
And typically,

1966
01:51:56.770 --> 01:52:01.000
um,
you know,
a little more complexity,
a little darker flavors in them typically.

1967
01:52:01.180 --> 01:52:04.760
Well,
he brought me some Ethiopian coffee that tasted like lemons.
Wow.

1968
01:52:04.780 --> 01:52:08.020
That's really interesting.
It was like he doesn't drink it with,
with uh,

1969
01:52:08.140 --> 01:52:09.460
any cream or anything in it.

1970
01:52:09.461 --> 01:52:13.630
So it was just black coffee and it had this like really lemony taste to it.

1971
01:52:13.631 --> 01:52:17.680
It's really good.
Interesting,
really good and really unusual.
I was like,
whoa.

1972
01:52:18.280 --> 01:52:20.890
And there's a bunch of different weird flavors.

1973
01:52:20.891 --> 01:52:23.410
Like Kona is one of my favorites from Hawaii.

1974
01:52:23.950 --> 01:52:26.060
Why has some really interesting flavors and you go,

1975
01:52:26.080 --> 01:52:30.190
look what this causing this stuff.
It's just altitude,
altitude.

1976
01:52:30.191 --> 01:52:33.170
The water boy growing in the soil like Cuban cigars.
Right.

1977
01:52:33.171 --> 01:52:36.760
A very distinct flavor,
which we can now legally bring back into the country.

1978
01:52:36.760 --> 01:52:40.730
Finally,
I got a hundred bucks worth.
Yeah.
Yeah.
For now.
I mean that,

1979
01:52:40.740 --> 01:52:42.730
that's gonna widen them.
Sure.
Yeah.

1980
01:52:42.760 --> 01:52:46.690
I'm sure it will officially go now if part of the education group [inaudible]

1981
01:52:46.820 --> 01:52:49.790
teaching people shit all the time.
There you go.
Part of an education group.

1982
01:52:49.900 --> 01:52:50.391
Thank you.

1983
01:52:50.391 --> 01:52:53.600
Having you on this program is educational for the folks that are listening.

1984
01:52:53.601 --> 01:52:57.710
So I think I'm a WHO's the Sam?
Not you want him to Cuba.
We should we fuck.

1985
01:52:57.711 --> 01:53:00.860
Yeah Dude,
let's do it.
Let's drive one of those old cars you have down there.

1986
01:53:02.060 --> 01:53:05.270
They have all these 1950s cars from before the embargo.

1987
01:53:05.330 --> 01:53:07.270
Yeah cause they couldn't have me.
We'll get new cars.
Yeah.

1988
01:53:07.500 --> 01:53:09.020
For Western cards anyways since then.

1989
01:53:09.050 --> 01:53:13.080
But it's sort of like a real knock on consumerism cause they do a great job of

1990
01:53:13.081 --> 01:53:15.060
these cars.
These cars are an amazing shaving.

1991
01:53:15.280 --> 01:53:18.770
There was this image that I saw recently online of all these people driving

1992
01:53:18.771 --> 01:53:23.750
these like 1950s early 1960 cars and they're beautiful.

1993
01:53:23.990 --> 01:53:28.670
Really well kept.
I was like,
dad is fascinating.
Like we have this idea that cars,

1994
01:53:28.671 --> 01:53:30.200
we have to get a new car every year,

1995
01:53:30.230 --> 01:53:32.880
the new cars or we have to have a new model every year.

1996
01:53:32.881 --> 01:53:36.290
Whether the new cars have to have a substantial improvement in all areas of

1997
01:53:36.291 --> 01:53:40.610
performance and braking and gadgets and all this different jazz.
But they also,

1998
01:53:40.611 --> 01:53:45.320
you know,
like a modern car today would not last 50 years on an island.

1999
01:53:45.470 --> 01:53:47.240
It's true.
You know too many,

2000
01:53:47.480 --> 01:53:52.010
too many complexities to many small electronics.
It just would fall apart.

2001
01:53:52.060 --> 01:53:53.050
You know the reason you're,

2002
01:53:53.060 --> 01:53:56.870
they have 50 scars and Kubis because you can remain the facture and replace

2003
01:53:56.871 --> 01:54:00.020
those parts and keep them running in the way that you would not be able to be

2004
01:54:00.021 --> 01:54:03.440
like a Prius or you know,
some modern,
you know,
fuel injected thing,

2005
01:54:03.470 --> 01:54:07.700
especially a Prius.
Anything that has batteries.
That's,
that's a huge,

2006
01:54:07.701 --> 01:54:09.840
huge issues.
The lithium ion,

2007
01:54:09.930 --> 01:54:14.120
the battery cobalt stuff wears out cadmium.
Yeah.

2008
01:54:14.121 --> 01:54:17.090
That's one thing that people aren't taking into consideration when they think

2009
01:54:17.091 --> 01:54:18.800
about the fact that they're driving.

2010
01:54:18.801 --> 01:54:23.480
Some ECO friendly vehicle won't see ECO friendly for right here.
Right.

2011
01:54:23.630 --> 01:54:27.010
Not necessarily ecofriendly for it's being pulled out of the ground.
I saw,

2012
01:54:27.030 --> 01:54:30.260
I saw an article,
I think it was inflammatory more than real,

2013
01:54:30.290 --> 01:54:33.950
but it pointed out that the ownership costs and the impact environmental impact

2014
01:54:33.951 --> 01:54:38.951
of a Prius versus at Hummer were equivalent because the Prius has a 100,000 mile

2015
01:54:39.891 --> 01:54:43.790
lifespan and has all these really expensive mind battery components to go into

2016
01:54:43.791 --> 01:54:48.650
it where a hummer has like a 300,000 mile lifespan and it's just an old

2017
01:54:48.651 --> 01:54:53.480
fashioned,
you know,
traditionally engineered car.
Right?
So there's,

2018
01:54:53.540 --> 01:54:54.960
there's uh,
uh,
you know,

2019
01:54:54.961 --> 01:54:57.590
it's sort of disingenuous though because who the fuck drives a Hummer for

2020
01:54:57.591 --> 01:55:00.530
300,000 miles?
Totally.
And,
and you know,
if you dig into the math,

2021
01:55:00.531 --> 01:55:02.540
some of it is a little bit bias doesn't seem to work all that well,

2022
01:55:02.541 --> 01:55:07.160
but it's not simply that because you drive a car that is electric.
It's not only,

2023
01:55:07.161 --> 01:55:08.880
you know,
that's not the only benefit on,
you know,

2024
01:55:08.900 --> 01:55:12.650
you not buying gas is not the only benefit of having a hybrid.

2025
01:55:12.680 --> 01:55:17.680
It would be amazing though to see what would happen if you took every car in Los

2026
01:55:17.690 --> 01:55:19.880
Angeles and replaced it with an electric car.
First of all,

2027
01:55:19.881 --> 01:55:23.240
there'd be people with dead batteries everywhere.

2028
01:55:23.390 --> 01:55:27.110
It'd be assholes that forgot to charge their car blocking the road off,

2029
01:55:27.190 --> 01:55:29.840
and because you just,
you don't have the access to charging,

2030
01:55:29.841 --> 01:55:31.670
it takes too long leap or late for work.

2031
01:55:31.671 --> 01:55:34.610
They don't have that half an hour to get that 50% charge would have fucking

2032
01:55:34.620 --> 01:55:38.660
takes,
but the sky would look different.
It might,
I mean the,

2033
01:55:38.690 --> 01:55:42.770
the air quality has improved pretty much every year since Reagan and in La,

2034
01:55:42.830 --> 01:55:44.190
right in the Reagan was the peak

2035
01:55:44.190 --> 01:55:47.010
<v 0>of the horrible smog.
I have to tell folks that,
you know,</v>

2036
01:55:47.011 --> 01:55:50.200
when I go back to visit the northeast where I'm from,
that,
oh yeah,
we don't care.

2037
01:55:50.210 --> 01:55:53.190
They make jokes,
but la smog,
it's like,
well,
it's actually not that bad.
There's,

2038
01:55:53.191 --> 01:55:56.400
the air quality's pretty darn good.
Especially where I live in west La,

2039
01:55:56.401 --> 01:56:01.080
it's where you're getting the wave from the ocean air.
It's,
it's pretty good.

2040
01:56:01.081 --> 01:56:04.110
There's the small,
you know,
when I first moved to La in 2005,
I was,

2041
01:56:04.180 --> 01:56:07.350
I rode cross country to motorcycle and I was coming down to the San Fernando

2042
01:56:07.350 --> 01:56:11.220
Valley and there's this layer of black and orange sludge that I drove down into,

2043
01:56:11.250 --> 01:56:15.270
you know,
um,
even that's happening less and less I think.

2044
01:56:15.271 --> 01:56:18.210
So I think the,
the sort of southern California,
you know,

2045
01:56:18.280 --> 01:56:21.300
Smaug trope is really overblown these days.

2046
01:56:21.360 --> 01:56:26.070
Well the smog laws that they put in place and the small screens that you have to

2047
01:56:26.071 --> 01:56:28.780
put your car through there,
pretty substantial and they're doing,

2048
01:56:28.800 --> 01:56:30.090
they're doing a good job as far as that.

2049
01:56:30.090 --> 01:56:35.090
And it makes it very difficult for you to take cars post 1975 pre 1975 they're

2050
01:56:35.701 --> 01:56:38.400
exempt.
But Post 1975 cars,

2051
01:56:38.401 --> 01:56:41.160
like this is a lot of them that have a huge issue getting smogged.

2052
01:56:41.161 --> 01:56:44.180
Getting spawn cleared.
Yeah.
I have a,
I have a one that's postdoc,

2053
01:56:44.190 --> 01:56:48.750
but it's a diesel,
so it's exempt.
Oh,
stinky.
That runs on vegetable ale.
Oh,

2054
01:56:48.751 --> 01:56:51.390
you one of those guys.
I've,
I've a couple of vehicles.
One's a Veggie oil,

2055
01:56:51.391 --> 01:56:55.500
a diesel and ones that motorcycle.
Yeah.
I have a of a traditional gas car too.

2056
01:56:55.501 --> 01:56:58.850
But now when you say runs on vegetable oil,
where do you get your vegetables?
Um,

2057
01:56:58.890 --> 01:57:01.110
I haven't been driving it too much,
so nowhere recently.

2058
01:57:01.111 --> 01:57:03.870
But I have a friend from Inglewood who had a small company.

2059
01:57:03.871 --> 01:57:07.710
He delivers it and he would deliver a gallons of,
you know,

2060
01:57:07.711 --> 01:57:11.070
sort of reclaimed waste vegetable oil.
He was clean.
Yeah,
they kick it.

2061
01:57:11.071 --> 01:57:14.660
I had a buddy of mine have converted,
he bought an old Mercedes whole diesel.

2062
01:57:14.690 --> 01:57:16.110
Those are the best ones to convert.

2063
01:57:16.710 --> 01:57:20.970
And you converted it to kitchen oil and he would get it from restaurants by

2064
01:57:20.971 --> 01:57:24.630
their kitchen.
Oh,
exactly.
Now these days,
I mean 20 years ago you could do that.

2065
01:57:24.631 --> 01:57:28.350
These days there's entire companies that have relationships with the Japanese

2066
01:57:28.351 --> 01:57:32.550
Chinese restaurants to do this and to resell it as a commercial company.

2067
01:57:32.551 --> 01:57:36.250
But what kind of gas mileage to get with one of those cars?
I mean,
um,

2068
01:57:36.300 --> 01:57:39.930
I was getting more than 30 miles a gallon with diesel still as an immediate

2069
01:57:39.931 --> 01:57:43.980
early eighties car.
And I think I lose one mile per gallon and Veggie oil.

2070
01:57:44.280 --> 01:57:48.600
So instead of like 30 you'd get like 29 roles again,
31 to 30 or something.

2071
01:57:48.601 --> 01:57:51.990
And is it a large vehicle?
You're talking about 300 CD Mercedes,

2072
01:57:51.991 --> 01:57:55.500
you know like 3,500 pound vehicle,
big heavy two door Mercedes,

2073
01:57:55.501 --> 01:57:57.870
but still a big one.
It's not very heavy.

2074
01:57:57.960 --> 01:58:02.170
3,500 isn't that really heavy compared to a modern car?
Sure.
Really?
Yeah.

2075
01:58:02.220 --> 01:58:04.470
What do you think a modern car weighs?
Uh,

2076
01:58:04.740 --> 01:58:09.570
18 to 2,500 I mean,
I guess that's crazy.
No,

2077
01:58:09.960 --> 01:58:13.530
that you,
that's like a really,
really light sports car.
Like A,

2078
01:58:13.740 --> 01:58:18.510
like a 1970 Porsche with everything stripped out with no radio,

2079
01:58:18.520 --> 01:58:22.950
no heat.
If you're lucky,
you know,
if that's true,
cause I had a 200 pounds,

2080
01:58:22.980 --> 01:58:27.720
I had a early eighties Oldsmobile Delta 88 they hold land yacht and nothing was

2081
01:58:27.721 --> 01:58:31.290
only 4,200 pounds.
That doesn't make sense either.
Are you sure?
Yeah,

2082
01:58:31.410 --> 01:58:36.410
because I have a nine 11 Porsche nine 11 gt three Rs,

2083
01:58:36.751 --> 01:58:41.130
which is the lightest model they make.
It's 3000 pounds and it's very light.

2084
01:58:41.260 --> 01:58:41.980
It's extremely

2085
01:58:41.980 --> 01:58:45.250
<v 2>light.
I mean,
they,
they,
it has carbon fibers,
seats,</v>

2086
01:58:45.280 --> 01:58:49.150
they strip out all the sound deadening and it's like you should make it as light

2087
01:58:49.151 --> 01:58:51.640
as possible.
No,
I'm 100% positive.
All right.
I'm,

2088
01:58:51.650 --> 01:58:55.000
I'm actually pretty deep in this world of lightening cars.

2089
01:58:55.390 --> 01:58:58.570
Like they drill into foot pedals to make the car lighter,
lighter.

2090
01:58:58.720 --> 01:59:03.670
They drill into the handle the door,
like to take a tea.
You've ever seen a 1972,

2091
01:59:03.671 --> 01:59:06.430
nine 11.
Yeah.
It's a tiny car.
Oh yeah.
I mean,

2092
01:59:06.431 --> 01:59:10.150
not smaller than a nine 11 of today.
If you're lucky,

2093
01:59:10.151 --> 01:59:14.470
you get one of those down to 2,200 pounds.
If you're really a fucking psycho,

2094
01:59:14.710 --> 01:59:19.710
you can get it down to like maybe 1800 but you have to use carbon fiber fenders,

2095
01:59:20.291 --> 01:59:22.970
fiberglass fenders,
things along those lines.
You,

2096
01:59:23.290 --> 01:59:28.150
you really compromise a lot of,
uh,
no comfort at all?
No.

2097
01:59:28.151 --> 01:59:32.920
The dashboards,
my Mercedes,
I'm not sure in what ways,
but it's a heavy car.

2098
01:59:32.950 --> 01:59:36.760
It's not,
it's not a light low key tiny car.
It can be 3,500 pounds,

2099
01:59:36.761 --> 01:59:40.990
but I mean like a BMW m three for instance.
Which is a sporty car.
I have,

2100
01:59:41.030 --> 01:59:44.320
I have a mini Cooper,
a modern one that's,
you know,
that's a small lightweight,

2101
01:59:44.350 --> 01:59:48.910
that's very level.
Yeah.
But an m three,
which is not a big car is 3,900 pounds.

2102
01:59:49.420 --> 01:59:52.630
Wow.
I'm surprised.
Yeah.
Most people are.
Yeah.

2103
01:59:52.660 --> 01:59:55.900
The most people think their cars are lighter than they really are.
Like A,

2104
01:59:56.110 --> 01:59:59.470
for instance,
like a dodge challenger.
She loves new dodge challengers.

2105
02:00:00.130 --> 02:00:03.390
You're looking at about 4,500 pounds.
Yeah.

2106
02:00:04.240 --> 02:00:06.450
It doesn't look like it would be,
no,
not at all.
Not at all.

2107
02:00:06.460 --> 02:00:11.020
You're dealing with V eight engines,
metal frames.
Interesting.

2108
02:00:11.021 --> 02:00:14.200
All that jazz.
Yeah.
People would be surprised at how heavy your shit is.

2109
02:00:14.210 --> 02:00:17.680
Like I have a Lexus x Suv,
you know those big,

2110
02:00:17.681 --> 02:00:20.890
that's like 6,000 pounds at fuck.
Oh my God,
he fat pig.

2111
02:00:20.920 --> 02:00:23.580
So maybe they're getting heavier.
Getting to that as,
as uh,
you know,

2112
02:00:23.590 --> 02:00:25.770
we built more things onto these vehicles with it,

2113
02:00:25.771 --> 02:00:30.290
trying to make a lot more cars out of aluminum.
Now.
Like Ford has done that.

2114
02:00:30.330 --> 02:00:33.340
They released a new truck with a aluminum frame,
right?
Yes.

2115
02:00:33.370 --> 02:00:36.970
They'd done that with their F-150 and they reduced it by more than 700 pounds.

2116
02:00:37.120 --> 02:00:39.040
I was a steel before,
I assume.
Yeah,
frame.

2117
02:00:39.130 --> 02:00:42.880
But it's amazing because the new aluminum that they're using are just as strong,

2118
02:00:42.881 --> 02:00:46.240
if not stronger in some ways than steel,
you know,

2119
02:00:46.270 --> 02:00:48.760
and they're substantially lighter.

2120
02:00:48.761 --> 02:00:53.350
It was really incredible benefits far as like gas mileage and all those things.

2121
02:00:53.351 --> 02:00:57.100
Yeah.
The,
the way they construct him is a little bit different,
but so far,
no,

2122
02:00:57.101 --> 02:00:59.620
a detriment.
The New Range Rover is doing the same thing.

2123
02:00:59.650 --> 02:01:04.060
The new range rover is cuts somewhere between six and 700 pounds from their cars

2124
02:01:04.061 --> 02:01:07.580
as well.
Okay.
Yeah.
Interesting.
Well,
you know,
regardless of the,

2125
02:01:07.581 --> 02:01:09.910
it doesn't matter of the weight of the NBC,
it's a,
you know,

2126
02:01:09.911 --> 02:01:14.230
I'm still getting 30 miles to the gallon.
Diesel diesel is way more efficient,

2127
02:01:14.231 --> 02:01:16.770
right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well it's,
it's,
it's compression.
The compression it does,

2128
02:01:16.780 --> 02:01:20.280
it doesn't explode the fuel.
It burns,
it releases the gases.
So it's not a,

2129
02:01:20.320 --> 02:01:22.800
it's an explosive decompression.
So it's much more efficient.

2130
02:01:22.850 --> 02:01:27.850
Neil young has like a ranch in northern California where he grows his own

2131
02:01:27.881 --> 02:01:28.601
plants.

2132
02:01:28.601 --> 02:01:32.950
Can make these Tim into bio diesel and powers his own vehicles for his own

2133
02:01:33.010 --> 02:01:36.940
diesel creation.
Closed loop and then Amaziah.
I love it.

2134
02:01:36.980 --> 02:01:40.640
He's a pretty amazing guy.
He's the best,
he's a fascinating dude.

2135
02:01:40.641 --> 02:01:43.520
He had some weird project he was doing though that everybody was like,
all right,

2136
02:01:43.521 --> 02:01:46.760
good luck with that.
He was trying to make some super expensive MP,

2137
02:01:46.761 --> 02:01:49.090
three player that recreated the sound of,

2138
02:01:49.091 --> 02:01:52.760
of a vinyl or as close to it as possible.

2139
02:01:53.120 --> 02:01:57.110
And he had a go fund me or a Kickstarter or some shit like that.

2140
02:01:57.111 --> 02:02:00.740
And people are like,
what?
First of all,
no one's given Neil young money.

2141
02:02:00.830 --> 02:02:01.910
It's not happening,
dude.

2142
02:02:01.911 --> 02:02:05.330
Your richest fuck thousand Acre ranch in northern California.

2143
02:02:05.331 --> 02:02:08.610
You're making your own diesel.
All right.
Go spend your money.
Right,
right,
right.

2144
02:02:08.630 --> 02:02:12.410
So like that was problematic,
but it was also like the,
the shape of this thing.

2145
02:02:12.411 --> 02:02:16.490
It was like a,
you know,
those below Roni,
whatever those chocolate bars,

2146
02:02:17.030 --> 02:02:21.430
that's what it looked like,
like a pyramid shape,
but long,
you know,
and uh,

2147
02:02:21.500 --> 02:02:24.440
he pull it,
pull it up.
Jamie.
This is a fucking disaster.

2148
02:02:24.441 --> 02:02:26.720
I mean it never went anywhere and then we gave a shit about it.

2149
02:02:27.170 --> 02:02:32.170
But the idea behind it was to create a richer sound that sort of emulates the

2150
02:02:32.451 --> 02:02:34.850
actual recording.
Your original recording of the,

2151
02:02:34.851 --> 02:02:38.690
of the MP three so then it reproduces it without the lossy sorta compression.

2152
02:02:38.720 --> 02:02:39.321
Yeah.

2153
02:02:39.321 --> 02:02:43.940
So to take this compressed sound and converted into something that has like more

2154
02:02:44.210 --> 02:02:48.200
depth,
more richness to Sony has a new thing that they just announced.
Two here.

2155
02:02:48.201 --> 02:02:51.020
Here it is the Pono highest resolution.

2156
02:02:51.021 --> 02:02:53.420
See how it looks like a chocolate bar that will oh yeah.

2157
02:02:53.450 --> 02:02:58.380
Weird fucking shape thing.
Does anybody buying those things Jamie?
No.

2158
02:02:58.480 --> 02:03:00.620
That he's buying a fucking thing.
Neil Young.
How dare you?

2159
02:03:01.280 --> 02:03:05.030
How dare you waste your time.
You Genius Looks Kinda like a Nintendo a yeah,

2160
02:03:05.420 --> 02:03:07.320
something game controllers.
Yeah,
it's,

2161
02:03:07.321 --> 02:03:12.321
it's very odd looking device and it kinda got trumped recently because Sony just

2162
02:03:12.921 --> 02:03:16.460
released some new version of a Walkman.

2163
02:03:16.820 --> 02:03:20.100
It's much thicker.
It's heavy.
It looks like a cell phone.

2164
02:03:20.101 --> 02:03:21.470
It looks almost like an iPhone,

2165
02:03:21.530 --> 02:03:26.270
but it's only for mp3s and there's Sony version is just much,
much.

2166
02:03:26.600 --> 02:03:31.600
It's a much more powerful as far as its ability to much more powerful than,

2167
02:03:32.211 --> 02:03:32.900
than your phone rather.

2168
02:03:32.900 --> 02:03:34.790
I don't know if it's more powerful than Neil Young's creation.

2169
02:03:35.560 --> 02:03:39.060
Can we get away from things here?
Um,
mindfulness,

2170
02:03:39.950 --> 02:03:43.790
mindfulness.
What do,
what do you mean by mindfulness?
When you say mindfulness,

2171
02:03:43.910 --> 02:03:47.180
that's one of those terms that like people go,
oh,
I'm not religious,

2172
02:03:47.181 --> 02:03:51.200
but I'm spiritual.
You know,
practicing mindfulness.
It's,

2173
02:03:51.680 --> 02:03:54.050
I love it as a,
as a,
as a thought,

2174
02:03:54.080 --> 02:03:56.650
but I don't like all the baggage that's attached.

2175
02:03:56.660 --> 02:03:59.930
And I think that most people who aren't doing it and don't know what it is,

2176
02:04:00.640 --> 02:04:03.860
and I say,
you know,
developing meditation practices would be good for you.

2177
02:04:03.861 --> 02:04:06.650
And I get the response,
oh,
I can never shut my mind.

2178
02:04:06.770 --> 02:04:10.130
Well that isn't the point of meditating.
It's like,
you know,

2179
02:04:10.131 --> 02:04:13.120
the point of going into the gym is not to be strong.

2180
02:04:13.130 --> 02:04:15.830
The play is to lift weights like this.
There's an exercise.

2181
02:04:15.831 --> 02:04:20.090
Meditation is a practice you do,
and you might get to a quieter mind,

2182
02:04:20.120 --> 02:04:24.950
but the practice is not quieting your mind.
Right.
So to answer your question,

2183
02:04:24.951 --> 02:04:29.951
mindfulness is paying attention to the present moment in a specific way on

2184
02:04:31.251 --> 02:04:36.010
purpose.
Now that sounds simple.
It is,

2185
02:04:36.030 --> 02:04:38.040
but it's not really simple

2186
02:04:38.040 --> 02:04:41.310
<v 0>in practice is it?
For most folks it is.
It actually is.
Well,</v>

2187
02:04:41.340 --> 02:04:42.990
this doesn't may even types of meditation,
right?

2188
02:04:42.991 --> 02:04:45.970
That the classic meditations of a Pasta,
Samatha metal,

2189
02:04:45.980 --> 02:04:49.470
these are all fairly similar in that you pick something,

2190
02:04:49.471 --> 02:04:54.150
some anchor to hold your attention on and then simply you notice when you've

2191
02:04:54.151 --> 02:04:58.800
drifted,
since you have a mind,
it will drift.
It'll get,
you know,
fantasize,
dream,

2192
02:04:58.801 --> 02:05:03.030
remember,
wish,
plan,
and we noticed you're not holding that attention.
Focus,

2193
02:05:03.031 --> 02:05:03.864
that anchor,

2194
02:05:04.470 --> 02:05:07.500
you release whatever ever it is you've gotten distracted by and bring your

2195
02:05:07.501 --> 02:05:12.000
attention back to the anchor.
And that's the rep of meditation.
That's it.

2196
02:05:12.840 --> 02:05:13.200
Oh,
I'm,

2197
02:05:13.200 --> 02:05:16.500
I'm supposed to be thinking about this sound or my watching my breath or he

2198
02:05:16.540 --> 02:05:20.340
listened to one,
you know,
note or something in a,
in a music play.
Oh,

2199
02:05:20.341 --> 02:05:22.470
I've gotten distracted.
Oh,
let it go.
Not now.

2200
02:05:22.500 --> 02:05:25.050
Back to the focus again and again and again and again.

2201
02:05:25.051 --> 02:05:29.190
And that's the entirety of most classic meditation is noticing when you've

2202
02:05:29.191 --> 02:05:31.680
gotten distracted,
you've left your anchor of your attention,

2203
02:05:32.400 --> 02:05:37.350
put down the distraction,
go back to the anchor.
So it's not a loss.

2204
02:05:37.410 --> 02:05:38.490
When you get distracted.

2205
02:05:38.620 --> 02:05:42.210
Not only is it not a loss if you want getting distracted,

2206
02:05:42.211 --> 02:05:46.320
you probably aren't alive.
You know,
if you have a mind,
it will get distracted.

2207
02:05:46.321 --> 02:05:50.990
That's what they do.
You know,
your mind pays attention to your pain,

2208
02:05:51.020 --> 02:05:54.720
your distractions,
your wishes,
your fantasies,
your memories.
I mean,

2209
02:05:54.721 --> 02:05:56.190
it's doing all of these things.
If you,

2210
02:05:56.200 --> 02:05:59.310
if you're able to sit down and shut your mind off,
you probably don't have one.

2211
02:05:59.850 --> 02:06:04.850
So when people talk about the difficulty that they have in meditation,

2212
02:06:04.921 --> 02:06:08.640
you think they'd probably get to that step and they go,
God can't do it.
And they,

2213
02:06:08.670 --> 02:06:11.730
yeah,
and they're,
and they're basically saying,
I'm not any good at it.

2214
02:06:11.731 --> 02:06:14.610
Instead of saying,
well,
being good at it or not is not the point.

2215
02:06:14.611 --> 02:06:16.550
The point is doing it.
You know,

2216
02:06:16.560 --> 02:06:19.170
if you went to the gym and pumped iron and a bunch of bench presses,

2217
02:06:19.350 --> 02:06:23.550
were you good at it?
Well,
maybe,
maybe like a PR,
a personal record or something,

2218
02:06:23.551 --> 02:06:26.700
but going versus not going is what matters.

2219
02:06:26.730 --> 02:06:30.540
Not critiquing necessarily every little bit of what you do.

2220
02:06:30.600 --> 02:06:32.970
Some people are terrified though,
of silence.

2221
02:06:33.510 --> 02:06:38.220
Terrified of silence and just being sitting alone doing nothing.
It's like no,

2222
02:06:38.400 --> 02:06:41.730
they would rather climb a fucking mountain in their underwear.

2223
02:06:42.060 --> 02:06:46.740
Then just sit alone in a room by themselves.
Okay,

2224
02:06:46.741 --> 02:06:48.660
I'm going to leave you here for three hours.
You can't talk.

2225
02:06:49.020 --> 02:06:51.930
I just want you to breathe in three hours in a scary too.
Right?

2226
02:06:51.931 --> 02:06:54.660
And can you tell people,
here's how you should meditate.
And you know,

2227
02:06:54.661 --> 02:06:55.770
they go to a meditation class,

2228
02:06:55.771 --> 02:06:58.050
like a Buddhist center and they have to sit there for an hour and a half.

2229
02:06:58.500 --> 02:07:03.240
That's a big ask initially.
So I often tell folks 20 minutes,
you know,

2230
02:07:03.510 --> 02:07:06.120
even that can be a big ask for some folks.
So I say,
you know,

2231
02:07:06.150 --> 02:07:09.030
take your first five minutes and do a concentration practice.

2232
02:07:09.031 --> 02:07:11.310
Took a very narrow focus.

2233
02:07:11.311 --> 02:07:14.400
Like watch the sensation of air crossing her upper lip.

2234
02:07:14.401 --> 02:07:19.200
Just pay attention to that tickle.
That's it.
Very narrow,
tight spacial focus.

2235
02:07:19.740 --> 02:07:22.050
And do that for five minutes.
By the end of that time,

2236
02:07:22.051 --> 02:07:24.450
your mind's probably a little more stable.

2237
02:07:24.780 --> 02:07:27.390
And then do what I call an awareness or insight practice.

2238
02:07:27.391 --> 02:07:30.450
Watch more rhythmic things like your breath rise and fall or the sound of

2239
02:07:30.451 --> 02:07:34.560
traffic going by the road or something.
And we see your mind is more stable.

2240
02:07:34.620 --> 02:07:35.453
Like how so?

2241
02:07:35.560 --> 02:07:39.040
Well you have less random things popping up in your mind after doing some

2242
02:07:39.160 --> 02:07:42.550
concentration practice.
There's less.
It feels less busy,

2243
02:07:42.551 --> 02:07:44.620
less of the monkey mind chatter.
It's still there,

2244
02:07:44.980 --> 02:07:48.910
but it's a little less insistent when you've done some concentration practice.

2245
02:07:49.030 --> 02:07:53.890
I mean concentrating on anything sort of re uh,
directs your attention,

2246
02:07:53.891 --> 02:07:55.810
resources and what you're thinking about.

2247
02:07:56.260 --> 02:07:59.260
And if what you're really thinking about is simply attending,

2248
02:07:59.290 --> 02:08:01.600
focusing for its own sake,

2249
02:08:02.140 --> 02:08:06.250
then you build those resources and build more strength and resources in
focusing.

2250
02:08:06.940 --> 02:08:09.820
And so then later on when you're walking around the world,

2251
02:08:10.120 --> 02:08:13.480
you have a more spacious mind.
You have some space between your thoughts,

2252
02:08:13.720 --> 02:08:15.280
your less automatically reactive.

2253
02:08:15.281 --> 02:08:19.220
You're going to cut somebody off in traffic and you know,
pick them the bird.
Um,

2254
02:08:19.540 --> 02:08:23.380
these are all things that happened as a consequence of developing more
resources.

2255
02:08:23.650 --> 02:08:28.450
So what you do on the cushion or wherever you happen to meditate translates to

2256
02:08:28.451 --> 02:08:32.800
less reactivity,
more sustained focus,
better attention,

2257
02:08:32.801 --> 02:08:35.530
better sleep,
less anxiety,
less anger,

2258
02:08:36.280 --> 02:08:38.680
but you weren't practicing all those things.

2259
02:08:38.681 --> 02:08:41.290
Those things come from having more stable attention,

2260
02:08:42.160 --> 02:08:43.600
more stable executive function.

2261
02:08:44.080 --> 02:08:49.080
I sort of feel like a lot of people operate on momentum and that they kind of,

2262
02:08:49.330 --> 02:08:54.330
that momentum oftentimes is like nipping at their heels and they can never rest.

2263
02:08:54.821 --> 02:08:59.821
It's like the momentum of all their past actions and thoughts and the things

2264
02:08:59.870 --> 02:09:03.250
they have to deal with in their life,
their bills,
their responsibilities,

2265
02:09:03.550 --> 02:09:07.870
all that stuff is sort of pushing you.
Sure.
And when they go to bed,
they're like,

2266
02:09:07.871 --> 02:09:10.360
their head is still spinning.
I can't stop thinking.

2267
02:09:10.361 --> 02:09:12.910
I got to keep my mouth shut your mind off.

2268
02:09:12.911 --> 02:09:16.090
And all this background noise starts to rise to the surface.
Sure.
Yeah.
Uh,

2269
02:09:16.091 --> 02:09:19.360
meditation is something that can quiet that.
Absolutely.

2270
02:09:19.361 --> 02:09:23.140
It will help you choose how you react.
I mean,
I did the,

2271
02:09:23.150 --> 02:09:25.690
the phrase I use is intention versus momentum.

2272
02:09:26.110 --> 02:09:29.530
You learn to choose and to act versus react and to be,
you know,

2273
02:09:29.650 --> 02:09:33.430
act from a place of choice and control instead of always,
you know,

2274
02:09:33.520 --> 02:09:37.570
reeling based on your environment.
Do you use sensory deprivation tanks?

2275
02:09:37.750 --> 02:09:40.390
I have a,
I have not.
It might be fun to do,
you know,

2276
02:09:40.391 --> 02:09:43.500
considering I have a sort of static Shamana you have,
you have,
I have not.

2277
02:09:43.510 --> 02:09:46.510
I have not.
I'm not you slip tanks.
No,
I've never,
I've never had a float tank.

2278
02:09:46.570 --> 02:09:51.010
That's crazy.
And I know,
right.
I've never,
uh,
never ended up in one a really.

2279
02:09:51.011 --> 02:09:53.260
I've been interested in it,
but never quite happen.
So how does it kind of like,

2280
02:09:53.261 --> 02:09:56.680
you not get into that,
that seems really bizarre to try everything.
I mean,

2281
02:09:56.681 --> 02:09:59.350
there's all kinds of things that I've gotten into.
Yeah.

2282
02:09:59.351 --> 02:10:02.500
But that's the mother fucker.
I can't believe you haven't tried that.
I've had,

2283
02:10:02.501 --> 02:10:05.920
I've had one of my basement for the past 15 years.
[inaudible] 13.

2284
02:10:06.430 --> 02:10:11.020
And is it a body temperature,
Epsom salts kind of thing?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well,
um,

2285
02:10:11.021 --> 02:10:15.190
our started doing it in the early two thousands.
I,
um,

2286
02:10:15.430 --> 02:10:18.130
I went to a place and tried it out for the first time and I was hooked.

2287
02:10:18.240 --> 02:10:21.850
I read about it,
seen the altered states movie,
got excited about it,

2288
02:10:21.851 --> 02:10:26.500
read John Lilly's book the deep self.
And um,
if you've never done it,
it's,

2289
02:10:26.501 --> 02:10:29.230
it's meditation times a hundred.
Sure.
Because you don't feel your body,

2290
02:10:29.231 --> 02:10:31.870
you look literally detached from the bottom,
right.

2291
02:10:31.930 --> 02:10:33.800
Once you become relaxed enough to

2292
02:10:34.910 --> 02:10:38.850
<v 2>do the same meditation practices concentrate,
I um,
uh,</v>

2293
02:10:39.020 --> 02:10:42.680
I concentrate on my breath.
That's what I do in with the good out with the bad.

2294
02:10:43.010 --> 02:10:45.880
And I do it over a long period of time.
Like I,

2295
02:10:45.881 --> 02:10:48.170
I like to do a one minute breath.

2296
02:10:48.530 --> 02:10:52.220
I like to do one minute in and one minute and out because it's very difficult

2297
02:10:52.221 --> 02:10:54.800
and requires a lot of discipline.
It requires a lot of discipline.

2298
02:10:54.801 --> 02:10:59.620
Not to just exhale all your air show right away,
but in doing so it,

2299
02:10:59.630 --> 02:11:02.900
that's like the base,
that's what,
that's how I build up my,

2300
02:11:02.901 --> 02:11:05.670
and then anything after that is easy.
And,
um,

2301
02:11:05.720 --> 02:11:08.630
the focus on the breath,

2302
02:11:08.660 --> 02:11:12.020
it takes away from freaking out about the fact that are floating around this

2303
02:11:12.021 --> 02:11:17.021
tank and you don't feel your body and the absence of sensory perception and you

2304
02:11:17.071 --> 02:11:18.470
don't really not getting anything in there.

2305
02:11:18.471 --> 02:11:19.610
You're getting a little bit of movement.

2306
02:11:19.611 --> 02:11:23.660
Sometimes your body will develop like itches like,
God,
I got to Itch my face.

2307
02:11:23.930 --> 02:11:25.040
Yeah.
And it's really don't,

2308
02:11:25.070 --> 02:11:27.140
it's not eating like you didn't get bit by a fucking mosquito.

2309
02:11:27.141 --> 02:11:29.860
You're just freaking out.
It's like random sensory.
Yeah.

2310
02:11:29.960 --> 02:11:32.180
Your brain's freaking out because it's not getting any input.

2311
02:11:32.181 --> 02:11:35.150
So it starts creating norms.
There's,
there's lots of yeah.

2312
02:11:35.190 --> 02:11:39.930
<v 0>Ways you can sort of trick the brain into producing input like that even without</v>

2313
02:11:40.140 --> 02:11:44.490
climbing into a float tank.
Uh,
the simplest hack for that is probably,
um,

2314
02:11:44.580 --> 02:11:49.560
someone called Ganzfeld classes,
take a ping pong cut in half,
trim the edges,

2315
02:11:49.561 --> 02:11:53.010
they aren't sharp and essentially make a pair of goggles where you're covering

2316
02:11:53.040 --> 02:11:54.540
each tie with the ping pong,

2317
02:11:54.541 --> 02:11:58.650
half ping pong ball and then sit and look through the,

2318
02:11:58.651 --> 02:12:02.400
the white balls,
um,
at a,

2319
02:12:02.460 --> 02:12:04.820
at a white wall that you're protecting light onto.

2320
02:12:04.860 --> 02:12:08.650
So there's some indirect light and keep your eyes open to stare at the inside to

2321
02:12:08.651 --> 02:12:09.960
these curved spaces.

2322
02:12:09.961 --> 02:12:13.860
You can't resolve distance who can't resolve a flat surface and after a few

2323
02:12:13.860 --> 02:12:17.820
minutes you start hallucinating interest.
The same thing you experience.

2324
02:12:17.821 --> 02:12:20.450
I'm sharing.
You have some,
some hallucinations when your visions,

2325
02:12:20.460 --> 02:12:23.100
when you're deep in your,
in your float tank too,
right?
Yeah.

2326
02:12:23.101 --> 02:12:24.810
You certainly do the same exact thing.

2327
02:12:24.811 --> 02:12:27.840
It's triggered within moments sometimes for some people a few minutes anyways

2328
02:12:27.841 --> 02:12:30.570
with Ganzfeld cause the eyes being open and trying to look,

2329
02:12:30.571 --> 02:12:32.010
but not seeing any surface.

2330
02:12:32.220 --> 02:12:35.250
It's a very similar phenomenon I about to your float tank.
Yeah,
I bet it is.

2331
02:12:35.280 --> 02:12:36.990
The difference being that in the float tank,

2332
02:12:36.991 --> 02:12:39.660
one of the benefits of it is the fact that either

2333
02:12:40.320 --> 02:12:42.930
<v 2>the absence of sensory dep or sensory input,</v>

2334
02:12:42.931 --> 02:12:45.000
it seems like your brain has way more resources.

2335
02:12:45.240 --> 02:12:48.870
So it seems like problems seemed to be easier to fix.
Yup.
Yup.
They've seemed to,

2336
02:12:48.871 --> 02:12:50.580
solutions seem to be more apparent.

2337
02:12:50.820 --> 02:12:53.550
You just have a better understanding of things.

2338
02:12:53.650 --> 02:12:57.070
<v 0>Yeah.
You know,
I think why haven't gotten into float tanks because I have other,</v>

2339
02:12:57.340 --> 02:13:01.180
you know,
ecstatic,
ecstatic,
meaning taking you out of ordinary reality.

2340
02:13:01.630 --> 02:13:05.590
I have other techniques that work really well for me.
And then I,
I tend to use,

2341
02:13:05.610 --> 02:13:09.370
you know,
like,
like rhythmic movement until your mind shifts.
Um,

2342
02:13:09.490 --> 02:13:12.910
and then for technology assisted stuff,
I mean,
I,
I run a neurofeedback center.

2343
02:13:12.911 --> 02:13:16.840
I can put you in a state in half an hour,
you know,

2344
02:13:16.841 --> 02:13:20.830
with wires on your head.
And so if I want to dial in a specific state,

2345
02:13:20.860 --> 02:13:23.140
I will dial in a specific state for myself.

2346
02:13:23.690 --> 02:13:25.510
This is a massive benefit to the tank.

2347
02:13:25.511 --> 02:13:27.980
I would really love you to experience it and then hear what your,

2348
02:13:27.981 --> 02:13:32.040
your thoughts on it are.
Because it's,
I'll send you down to the lab in Venice.

2349
02:13:32.040 --> 02:13:34.260
<v 2>You're in the west side?
Yeah,
I live in Culver city.
Yeah.</v>

2350
02:13:34.261 --> 02:13:36.120
The float lab is the spot.
This,
I mean,

2351
02:13:36.121 --> 02:13:39.490
this guy crashed who's created these tanks.
It's got the most advanced tanks.

2352
02:13:39.750 --> 02:13:43.170
Have a friend of a friend.
Actually,
I,
uh,
I've heard of him.
So yeah,

2353
02:13:43.171 --> 02:13:45.870
he's a master when it comes to that.
He's really when,

2354
02:13:45.900 --> 02:13:50.900
when the entire float world was building these flimsy plastic sort of shitty

2355
02:13:50.941 --> 02:13:55.840
things are those things.
Yeah.
He came up with this giant steel walled structure.

2356
02:13:55.860 --> 02:14:00.420
It looks like a meat locker.
Okay.
His,
they're far more insulated.

2357
02:14:00.421 --> 02:14:03.390
They retain heat better.
The linings are far thicker.

2358
02:14:03.391 --> 02:14:06.180
He uses the same lines that they use it.
They make Koi ponds.

2359
02:14:06.810 --> 02:14:11.090
Everything he built to the 10th degree.
Yeah.
I'm just in checking it out.
Uh,

2360
02:14:11.490 --> 02:14:14.310
might be some way we could do under,
your head's not immerse does it?

2361
02:14:14.400 --> 02:14:17.520
No boats under half water.
Your bodies floating.
Right.

2362
02:14:17.521 --> 02:14:20.790
So if you're lying on your back,
I would love to get your water,

2363
02:14:21.510 --> 02:14:24.370
but you can't do EEG underwater.
So we're wet electrics.

2364
02:14:24.430 --> 02:14:28.290
So what couldn't you develop some uh,
electric?

2365
02:14:28.291 --> 02:14:32.090
Where are you attaching the electrode?
Scalp,
scalp.
All over the scalp.
Yeah.

2366
02:14:32.260 --> 02:14:36.480
Differently.
He could you pro,
it's a grid to the frontal area.

2367
02:14:36.610 --> 02:14:40.590
It wouldn't give you the w wouldn't be the thing with EEG is to compare your

2368
02:14:40.591 --> 02:14:42.360
results to any existing literature.

2369
02:14:42.361 --> 02:14:45.270
You have to record the same spot at the same distribution of spots.

2370
02:14:45.290 --> 02:14:48.750
But there'd be a way to do it inside some sort of a divers camp.
There might be.

2371
02:14:48.780 --> 02:14:50.580
Yeah,
exactly.
There are a few,

2372
02:14:51.060 --> 02:14:54.270
there are a few ways that this might be accomplished because I've seen EEG done

2373
02:14:54.271 --> 02:14:56.490
on actual divers like unschooled divers.

2374
02:14:56.850 --> 02:15:00.180
So there probably are ways of like electrodes that can get where that you can

2375
02:15:00.181 --> 02:15:04.030
serve seal against the scalp with Colloidal,
you know,
gels and um,

2376
02:15:04.190 --> 02:15:08.190
but I would love to see what happens to brands under that altered state.
Yeah,

2377
02:15:08.191 --> 02:15:11.430
I would love to see you try it.
I'd love to see you do some tests on it.

2378
02:15:11.610 --> 02:15:16.610
Crashes also developing some sort of a weird video component to his tanks where

2379
02:15:16.711 --> 02:15:21.711
he has a engineered these screens to have the lowest amount of light emission

2380
02:15:22.111 --> 02:15:27.111
that you can possibly have while still seeing the image so that these images,

2381
02:15:27.361 --> 02:15:30.350
cause you're in complete silence,
complete darkness.
I mean you,
you don't,

2382
02:15:30.450 --> 02:15:31.710
there's no light in there at all.

2383
02:15:31.950 --> 02:15:35.670
So having this incredibly minimal amount of light on these screens,

2384
02:15:35.820 --> 02:15:39.240
you can see the images,
but you don't see the television.

2385
02:15:39.340 --> 02:15:43.170
I don't see that the screen itself and he believes in,

2386
02:15:43.171 --> 02:15:47.550
in the absence of sensory input,
we'll your,
your brain having more resources,

2387
02:15:47.730 --> 02:15:51.390
you can take an information better so you can learn quicker.
I mean,

2388
02:15:51.391 --> 02:15:54.240
I think it's probably very likely.
Yeah.
Less distraction.

2389
02:15:54.840 --> 02:15:58.800
And also you can do things if you did things from first person perspective,

2390
02:15:58.830 --> 02:16:02.070
if you had videos of people learning things from first person perspective,

2391
02:16:02.071 --> 02:16:06.180
it could sync up in your mind,
you know,
interesting.

2392
02:16:06.181 --> 02:16:08.270
It must happen to mirror neurons in some way.
Well,

2393
02:16:08.290 --> 02:16:11.310
it's just theoretical at this point.
I don't think he's actually achieved it.

2394
02:16:11.340 --> 02:16:15.600
I mean he's,
he's,
I know he's got the tank set up right now with this,
uh,

2395
02:16:15.601 --> 02:16:17.940
this video,
maybe you could tell,

2396
02:16:17.970 --> 02:16:21.210
it sounds like we need to do is as out of bio feedback and put it to it where

2397
02:16:21.211 --> 02:16:24.570
what you're seeing is contingent on your brain moving and specific directions.

2398
02:16:24.600 --> 02:16:26.790
Mm.
Yeah.
And then you could actually could,
I mean,

2399
02:16:26.820 --> 02:16:30.040
if the float tanks putting you into this receptive state and deep

2400
02:16:30.040 --> 02:16:33.820
<v 0>state quickly,
and it sounds like it is with biofeedback,
you could probably,</v>

2401
02:16:33.821 --> 02:16:38.240
you know,
like incredibly powerfully just move people across state shifts.

2402
02:16:38.241 --> 02:16:40.150
Let's see.
Only atmosphere that I know of,

2403
02:16:40.151 --> 02:16:44.740
the only environment where your body is literally untethered from your mind.

2404
02:16:46.190 --> 02:16:48.910
You don't feel anything you feels like you're flying,

2405
02:16:49.360 --> 02:16:54.360
like just floating through the unit and there's a weird Lucian of motion that

2406
02:16:55.331 --> 02:16:58.120
you get when you're in that thing.
When you,
you floating for a while,

2407
02:16:58.121 --> 02:17:01.000
you feel like you're flying,
like you feel like you're flying forward.

2408
02:17:01.030 --> 02:17:03.760
Interesting.
Like you're moving,
there's a feeling of movement.

2409
02:17:04.270 --> 02:17:06.180
Can you feel gravity now?
Okay.

2410
02:17:06.380 --> 02:17:10.120
You're totally floating because of the fact that there's a thousand pounds of

2411
02:17:10.121 --> 02:17:13.750
salt and this water and the water being 93.5 degrees,

2412
02:17:13.760 --> 02:17:17.680
right flow or 94 some people you're floating in a very buoyant,

2413
02:17:17.780 --> 02:17:22.000
not feeling anything.
Yeah.
The water becomes your air,
the air becomes your skin.

2414
02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:26.230
It's all one thing and you're just no more input and he does.
Cool.
Yeah.

2415
02:17:26.250 --> 02:17:27.820
Total darkness.
It sounds like.

2416
02:17:27.910 --> 02:17:30.850
I'd love to hear more about how you haven't fucked with that yet.

2417
02:17:31.240 --> 02:17:34.630
It seems like something right up your alley.
It does.
Actually.
I,

2418
02:17:34.670 --> 02:17:39.220
it's probably just a function of I am a one guy,
you know,
it's too many things.

2419
02:17:39.370 --> 02:17:42.310
I mean,
I've,
I lived about a lot of different lives,
different careers.

2420
02:17:42.311 --> 02:17:45.310
It sounds like crazy.
Shumon wacky text.
Right man.
I mean,

2421
02:17:45.311 --> 02:17:48.930
I started Grad school at age 35 digit really?
You know,
uh,

2422
02:17:48.940 --> 02:17:53.440
it had other careers before that.
Like what are the careers?
Oh,
let's see.
Um,

2423
02:17:53.830 --> 02:17:57.210
I worked in patient psychiatric crisis for many years.
Uh,

2424
02:17:57.300 --> 02:18:00.010
that must have been fun.
Yeah,
that was kind of crazy.

2425
02:18:00.011 --> 02:18:04.150
I'm the most violent hospital in the state of Massachusetts.
Oh,
we're doing five,

2426
02:18:04.151 --> 02:18:07.630
10,
15 restraints,
a shift.
When I first got there.
Wow.

2427
02:18:07.720 --> 02:18:10.810
And after a year I took over training people how to do restraints and that's why

2428
02:18:10.811 --> 02:18:12.820
he started lifting weights.
No,
I was,

2429
02:18:12.821 --> 02:18:15.760
I was actually really into I Quito back then.
And uh,

2430
02:18:15.790 --> 02:18:19.810
that's about safe management of safe energy or not getting hurt when people are

2431
02:18:19.811 --> 02:18:21.850
throwing punches basically.
And,
uh,

2432
02:18:21.851 --> 02:18:25.210
I took over training the restraint team and after another year we were down to

2433
02:18:25.211 --> 02:18:26.480
like one a month because it was,

2434
02:18:26.481 --> 02:18:30.040
some of it was the expectations we're setting on the patients in the hospital.

2435
02:18:30.041 --> 02:18:32.560
You know,
the conflict was,
was there,
right.

2436
02:18:32.561 --> 02:18:36.280
Like oftentimes people discuss that when they talk about police violence that

2437
02:18:36.310 --> 02:18:40.960
the much of the violence that they get involved and to be mitigated if they had

2438
02:18:40.961 --> 02:18:45.580
a better way of communicating.
Sure.
Absolutely.
Um,
so I did that.
Um,

2439
02:18:45.600 --> 02:18:46.260
I,

2440
02:18:46.260 --> 02:18:50.290
my first jobs were working on farms and a little farming town in the northeast.

2441
02:18:50.470 --> 02:18:52.570
Picked Berries.
Hmm.
Uh,

2442
02:18:52.720 --> 02:18:55.750
I was a baker and caterer for a few years.

2443
02:18:55.751 --> 02:19:00.670
I worked in residential homes with retarded and multiply disabled adults.

2444
02:19:01.330 --> 02:19:03.820
Um,
worked in high tech for several years,

2445
02:19:03.821 --> 02:19:07.240
worked in the middleware where database company for a few years I worked for

2446
02:19:07.241 --> 02:19:08.440
neurofeedback guy,

2447
02:19:08.441 --> 02:19:11.980
I worked for an MRI imaging center doing a prediction of depression,

2448
02:19:11.981 --> 02:19:16.660
relapse based on brain changes with withdrew their meds.
Um,
you know,

2449
02:19:16.661 --> 02:19:19.870
so really a pretty broad,
you know,
high tech human services.

2450
02:19:19.871 --> 02:19:22.670
And then now I'm sort of combining the two.
Uh,

2451
02:19:22.840 --> 02:19:26.470
how much work do you do with people that have encountered traumatic brain

2452
02:19:26.471 --> 02:19:30.800
injuries?
More than I thought I would be.
Um,
you know,

2453
02:19:30.980 --> 02:19:35.060
neurofeedback is largely tuning circuits that exist.

2454
02:19:35.760 --> 02:19:40.010
Um,
and Tbi is traumatic head injuries.
Brain injuries are often different.

2455
02:19:40.011 --> 02:19:43.410
Architecture of the brain has been physically traumatized.
Um,

2456
02:19:43.940 --> 02:19:47.930
some Tbi people,
I can make really quick changes.
I have one client right now,

2457
02:19:47.931 --> 02:19:50.720
she came to see me.
She was having some tremors,

2458
02:19:50.950 --> 02:19:54.110
an opposite side from the head injury.
She was having a lot of impulsivity,

2459
02:19:54.111 --> 02:19:56.590
which is a pretty standard thing when you're,
you know,
head injured either.

2460
02:19:56.591 --> 02:19:59.860
The impulsivity is a weird,
wasn't it?
Yeah,
it's pretty dramatic.
Um,

2461
02:19:59.960 --> 02:20:02.900
often for head injuries and,
uh,
you know,

2462
02:20:03.440 --> 02:20:07.670
she's now finishing her 30 sessions.
She's gone off all of her meds.

2463
02:20:07.850 --> 02:20:11.090
She knows her on any anticonvulsant.
She's not on any,
any anti,
uh,

2464
02:20:11.110 --> 02:20:15.950
impulsivity meds in those four sleep meds.
So her brain change very,
very quickly,

2465
02:20:16.330 --> 02:20:18.880
uh,
and,
and sort of in the direction I was hoping it would.
And it,

2466
02:20:18.910 --> 02:20:20.840
it sort of just did what I asked it to.
Um,

2467
02:20:21.020 --> 02:20:22.930
I had a client last year who came to see me.

2468
02:20:22.950 --> 02:20:27.110
I just couldn't get his brain moving.
There was just too much going on.
Um,

2469
02:20:27.350 --> 02:20:29.420
so I so do you mean by and couldn't get his brain?

2470
02:20:29.720 --> 02:20:33.740
I couldn't get his frequencies to train up or down enough.

2471
02:20:33.890 --> 02:20:37.250
I couldn't get his symptoms to shift.
He was,
you know,
get worn out at,
you know,

2472
02:20:37.310 --> 02:20:42.300
new and every day and he was really impulsive and all the standard Tbi stuff.
Um,

2473
02:20:42.350 --> 02:20:46.940
so I think I've worked in the past decade with about seven or eight Tbi people

2474
02:20:47.360 --> 02:20:52.020
and you know,
three of them were dramatic responders and a couple were tough,

2475
02:20:52.070 --> 02:20:55.490
you know,
tough movers.
Cause so this guy that you couldn't yeah,
him to move.

2476
02:20:55.491 --> 02:21:00.490
What did you want to,
um,
you know,
he ended up going overseas to teach English.

2477
02:21:00.491 --> 02:21:00.910
He sort of,

2478
02:21:00.910 --> 02:21:05.240
he had an end to the time that I had him because he was going to the next job,

2479
02:21:05.241 --> 02:21:08.810
which was overseas.
So I only had him for like six or eight weeks or something.

2480
02:21:08.810 --> 02:21:12.290
So had I had him,
I would've said,
look,
me,
stop billing you,

2481
02:21:12.440 --> 02:21:15.320
which is what I do when I don't make results.
It doesn't happen very often,

2482
02:21:15.740 --> 02:21:18.500
but I suddenly stopped billing you and then just keep training and keep trying

2483
02:21:18.501 --> 02:21:21.770
different things until I find something that works for your specific brain.

2484
02:21:21.830 --> 02:21:24.650
And so it takes some of the pressure off them but not making them financial.

2485
02:21:24.651 --> 02:21:27.500
Yeah,
exactly.
So I signed people up for like a 30 session package,

2486
02:21:27.501 --> 02:21:31.220
which costs some money,
you know,
cost about one of our four k and um,

2487
02:21:31.490 --> 02:21:35.240
90% or more of people that brains do exactly what I ask and they're,

2488
02:21:35.340 --> 02:21:39.170
they're really happy with the results.
Does insurance cover that?
Sometimes?
Um,

2489
02:21:39.290 --> 02:21:42.260
depends,
you know,
uh,
um,
alternatives,

2490
02:21:42.261 --> 02:21:45.830
which is where I do neurofeedback is not a provider for any insurance.

2491
02:21:45.831 --> 02:21:47.180
So if you've got a PPO or something,

2492
02:21:47.181 --> 02:21:50.530
we can often submit against it for partial reimbursements are things,
um,

2493
02:21:50.600 --> 02:21:52.070
the addiction side of alternatives.

2494
02:21:52.130 --> 02:21:54.590
We actually are getting pretty good coverage these days.

2495
02:21:54.591 --> 02:21:59.591
I'm doctor Jaffe and Kern just got the center certified as an outpatient partial

2496
02:22:00.021 --> 02:22:03.160
hospitalization day program.
That's the non 12 step.
Uh,

2497
02:22:03.470 --> 02:22:04.580
in treatment program we have there,

2498
02:22:04.610 --> 02:22:07.910
it says gentlemen that you weren't getting results with.
What was his issue?

2499
02:22:07.911 --> 02:22:12.530
He had some sort of a concussion.
Massive,
yeah.
A car accident.
Yeah.
And He,

2500
02:22:12.550 --> 02:22:15.860
and he went coma for many weeks,
lost a big chunk of his brain in the front.

2501
02:22:15.920 --> 02:22:20.010
And so we had massive impulsivity cause the frontal lobe again is your
inhibitor.

2502
02:22:20.140 --> 02:22:24.650
It's so like as far as drinking sexual things all speeding,

2503
02:22:24.770 --> 02:22:27.030
it was sort of like acquired ADHD.

2504
02:22:27.060 --> 02:22:29.940
He sort of acquired it in his mid forties because of this head injury.

2505
02:22:30.180 --> 02:22:34.740
We had no self control.
Said what every,
you know,
inappropriate.
Um,

2506
02:22:35.250 --> 02:22:38.280
you know,
and then he would get worn out by one o'clock every day,
noon,

2507
02:22:38.281 --> 02:22:39.540
one o'clock.
You just,
this is done,

2508
02:22:39.570 --> 02:22:43.230
which is really common in Tbi just to not having any mental stamina.

2509
02:22:43.560 --> 02:22:46.140
And so for him it was let's get your sleep better because he wasn't sleeping

2510
02:22:46.141 --> 02:22:46.740
well,

2511
02:22:46.740 --> 02:22:49.420
let's make your daytime energy better and let's get you less impulsive with a

2512
02:22:49.421 --> 02:22:53.790
goals.
And those things all moved.
But they moved,
you know,

2513
02:22:54.750 --> 02:22:58.360
a fraction.
What I really wanted them to move.
And most people,

2514
02:22:58.440 --> 02:23:00.720
the reason why it was so frustrating because for most people,

2515
02:23:00.721 --> 02:23:03.450
neurofeedback is sort of a,
you know,
it's my silver bullet.

2516
02:23:03.480 --> 02:23:05.280
I can do lots of things with it.

2517
02:23:05.760 --> 02:23:10.350
I expect that nine or more than 910 people will just,
you know,

2518
02:23:10.351 --> 02:23:14.100
their brains will do what I ask,
even if they're dramatically impaired,
you know,

2519
02:23:14.101 --> 02:23:15.440
profoundly,
uh,
you know,

2520
02:23:15.450 --> 02:23:20.450
self stemming autistics people with major PTSD or major alcoholism or a lot of

2521
02:23:20.730 --> 02:23:22.950
really common presentation these days is,
um,

2522
02:23:23.610 --> 02:23:26.040
people that have been on sleeping meds for decades and they aren't working and

2523
02:23:26.041 --> 02:23:30.150
they can't sleep at,
but they're still on massive amounts of sleeping,
sleeping,

2524
02:23:30.151 --> 02:23:34.800
Tambien type things,
all kinds of things.
What are you thoughts on those?
Um,

2525
02:23:35.160 --> 02:23:38.220
the short answer is there's no such thing as a sleeping mat.

2526
02:23:38.700 --> 02:23:43.460
None of these sleep drugs make you sleep.
They all are hypnotics.
They,

2527
02:23:43.510 --> 02:23:45.090
they put you in a trance like state.

2528
02:23:45.091 --> 02:23:48.060
They sedate you into a hypnosis or hypnotic state.

2529
02:23:48.570 --> 02:23:51.120
And then if you're tired and the normal sleep reflexes there,

2530
02:23:51.121 --> 02:23:55.710
it takes over and you fall asleep.
But it didn't put you in a sleep state.

2531
02:23:55.711 --> 02:23:58.860
It puts you in a hypnotic state,
which is very different than a sleep state.

2532
02:23:59.070 --> 02:24:01.530
I have some friends that have real problems with those things and they have to

2533
02:24:01.531 --> 02:24:03.660
take them all the time.
Or they do take them all the time.

2534
02:24:03.700 --> 02:24:06.900
They think they have to take and they don't work after taking them for a while.

2535
02:24:06.901 --> 02:24:09.900
So people come to see me and say,
I've been taking sleep nug drugs for,
you know,

2536
02:24:09.901 --> 02:24:12.930
10 20 years and I haven't slept well in 10 years.

2537
02:24:14.010 --> 02:24:15.090
And so I start training up.

2538
02:24:15.120 --> 02:24:19.770
There are frequencies that caused deeper sleep at night.
More relaxation,

2539
02:24:19.840 --> 02:24:20.250
you know,

2540
02:24:20.250 --> 02:24:23.370
this is about sleep architecture is maintained by specific frequencies in the

2541
02:24:23.371 --> 02:24:25.740
brain.
Sleep spindles until I'll train those up,

2542
02:24:25.741 --> 02:24:28.620
make them stronger so they able to fall asleep more easily,

2543
02:24:28.621 --> 02:24:30.900
stay asleep more easily,
wake up more refreshed.

2544
02:24:30.960 --> 02:24:33.780
So I have a friend and he takes two a day.

2545
02:24:33.890 --> 02:24:35.820
It takes two of those fucking ambien things at night.

2546
02:24:35.850 --> 02:24:36.990
He scares the shit out of me.

2547
02:24:37.140 --> 02:24:39.990
Everyone's always worried he's not going to wake up one day.
Yeah.
Um,

2548
02:24:40.230 --> 02:24:44.760
what would you do to that guy?
I would say,
you know,
how comfortable are you,

2549
02:24:44.810 --> 02:24:49.140
you know,
reducing your ambien?
And usually the answer is,
I can't.
So,
okay,

2550
02:24:49.141 --> 02:24:53.910
let's move.
Okay,
let's forget him.
He's a junkie.
Let's,
uh,
let's go.
I mean,

2551
02:24:53.911 --> 02:24:57.840
Ambia Junkie,
it's probably a junkie for some other shit too.
Let's,
uh,

2552
02:24:57.870 --> 02:25:00.570
let's go with someone who just has a problem sleeping,
doesn't take anything.

2553
02:25:00.571 --> 02:25:03.720
It takes a little Tylenol pm or so.
I would just start training that.

2554
02:25:03.721 --> 02:25:05.280
I'm doing a brain map and Brighton assessment,

2555
02:25:05.290 --> 02:25:09.060
figure out which patterns are driving their sleep issues.

2556
02:25:09.090 --> 02:25:11.130
And usually it's some of the patterns evolving,

2557
02:25:11.131 --> 02:25:14.010
too much Beta activity toward the middle and back of the head.

2558
02:25:14.250 --> 02:25:17.850
Sometimes it's the same patterns that are producing some anxiety formations.

2559
02:25:18.390 --> 02:25:21.930
And so I'll find these patterns and then I'll just start training,
you know,

2560
02:25:22.060 --> 02:25:25.240
decreasing amounts of Beta,
increased amounts of Alpha or theta,

2561
02:25:25.241 --> 02:25:29.200
bringing those slower brainwaves up,
um,
maybe train up the sleep spindles,

2562
02:25:29.201 --> 02:25:31.600
which is what keeps you deeply asleep once you fall asleep.

2563
02:25:31.601 --> 02:25:34.930
It prevents you from kind of being woken by all the outside stimuli.

2564
02:25:35.020 --> 02:25:37.750
And what would you train this with,
with biofeedback in a measure?

2565
02:25:37.751 --> 02:25:39.820
Because you're making all brainwaves all the time.

2566
02:25:39.820 --> 02:25:42.910
This something people often don't know.
Right now,
Joe,
you're making Delta Theta,

2567
02:25:42.911 --> 02:25:45.550
Alpha,
Beta,
gamma,
and other brainwaves.
We haven't named.

2568
02:25:45.551 --> 02:25:48.820
You're making all of them all the time are the ones we have a named who we

2569
02:25:48.821 --> 02:25:51.910
haven't identified them either identified that we haven't really named them,

2570
02:25:51.911 --> 02:25:55.930
you know,
the,
uh,
in,
in order of,
uh,
um,

2571
02:25:56.140 --> 02:26:00.510
of discovery.
Alpha was the first one.
Alpha is the first Greek letter,
but Alphas,

2572
02:26:00.640 --> 02:26:02.680
how about 10 hertz,
10 cycles per second,

2573
02:26:02.980 --> 02:26:06.250
and there's at least two or three waves slower than alpha that we discovered

2574
02:26:06.251 --> 02:26:11.200
later.
So in order going from slow to fast,
it's Delta Theta,
Alpha,
Beta,
gamma,

2575
02:26:12.280 --> 02:26:16.270
and gamma traditionally stops at 40 hertz,
40 cycles per second.

2576
02:26:16.510 --> 02:26:20.680
But brainwaves go up to about two or even 300 cycles per second.
Wow.

2577
02:26:20.980 --> 02:26:23.920
But we haven't actually given those functional,
you know,
bands,

2578
02:26:23.921 --> 02:26:28.810
different names beyond gamma.
So is it bio,
is there any biodiversity?

2579
02:26:29.020 --> 02:26:31.330
Does everybody have the same sort of frequencies?

2580
02:26:31.360 --> 02:26:33.490
Everyone has the same functional frequencies,
but you know,

2581
02:26:33.491 --> 02:26:38.230
you might have more alpha than I do,
you know,
as a,

2582
02:26:38.231 --> 02:26:40.570
as a baseline.
And so when I'm doing the brain maps,

2583
02:26:40.571 --> 02:26:43.870
this is a really good question.
When doing the brain maps,
I'll take baselines.

2584
02:26:43.871 --> 02:26:46.420
Let's have you sit with your eyes closed for five minutes and record your eyes

2585
02:26:46.421 --> 02:26:49.870
closed,
you know,
resting state and the little court eyes open,
resting state,

2586
02:26:50.080 --> 02:26:53.740
the brains very different eyes open and eyes closed.
I'm in very,

2587
02:26:53.741 --> 02:26:54.670
very different typically.

2588
02:26:55.030 --> 02:26:58.240
And so I'll take that baseline data and compare it to a normative database with

2589
02:26:58.241 --> 02:27:02.080
thousands of brains in it and get heat maps.

2590
02:27:02.081 --> 02:27:06.580
Picture maps out of that,
that tell me how different you are than the population.

2591
02:27:06.850 --> 02:27:07.683
Statistically.

2592
02:27:07.840 --> 02:27:12.070
How much of that varies based on intention based on not much at all.

2593
02:27:12.340 --> 02:27:16.240
A Q EEG or brain map is stable year after year,
after year after year,

2594
02:27:16.241 --> 02:27:21.220
barring maturation medication or head injury.
What about sleep?
Um,

2595
02:27:21.221 --> 02:27:22.930
if somebody is really sleep deprived,

2596
02:27:23.050 --> 02:27:25.840
there are some differences in the Qeg but if they're a little bit,

2597
02:27:25.841 --> 02:27:29.180
a little bit of vagaries and sleep here and there don't actually affect the,
um,

2598
02:27:29.220 --> 02:27:30.460
the sleep is much more important.

2599
02:27:30.461 --> 02:27:33.970
Like caffeine status and psychostimulant status.

2600
02:27:33.971 --> 02:27:35.290
Those things are much bigger deal.

2601
02:27:35.291 --> 02:27:38.330
When I'm doing brain recordings then how rested you,
I mean,

2602
02:27:38.500 --> 02:27:41.710
folks come in having not slept.
It's not a very valid reading or having been,

2603
02:27:41.711 --> 02:27:43.840
you know,
drunk the night before.
It's not a valid reading.

2604
02:27:44.230 --> 02:27:47.860
But if someone's just like,
oh I got seven hours,
not nine hours,
not no problem,

2605
02:27:48.610 --> 02:27:51.460
you know,
and then statistically we say,
okay,
you know,

2606
02:27:51.461 --> 02:27:56.020
let's say your brain has x amount of Alpha with your eyes open.
If it's too much,

2607
02:27:56.021 --> 02:27:58.930
that means your spacey,
too much data.
It means you're impulsive.

2608
02:27:59.110 --> 02:28:03.880
Too Much Beta in the back might mean you're anxious,
you know,

2609
02:28:03.881 --> 02:28:06.100
different asymmetries in the front,
maybe depressed.

2610
02:28:06.460 --> 02:28:10.030
And so I'll see five to 10 of these big patterns.

2611
02:28:10.480 --> 02:28:12.550
I draw some arbitrary line in the sand,
you know,

2612
02:28:12.551 --> 02:28:15.700
more than one and a half standard deviations I consider clinically relevant are

2613
02:28:15.701 --> 02:28:17.200
problematic.
Maybe.

2614
02:28:17.560 --> 02:28:21.230
And then we sit and talk about all these patterns that rise to that,
you know,

2615
02:28:21.290 --> 02:28:25.280
outlier level and try to figure out,
well,
you know,
this one can mean this.

2616
02:28:25.700 --> 02:28:28.130
Is that true for you?
Oh it is?
Okay,
great.
Let's believe that one.

2617
02:28:28.370 --> 02:28:31.280
This one can mean this.
This one can be in this,
this,
oh,
this one isn't true.
Okay,

2618
02:28:31.281 --> 02:28:35.030
let's a normal variant for you.
Let's move on.
So these are not diagnostic tests.

2619
02:28:35.031 --> 02:28:38.450
They're more sort of prognostic,
where I'm guessing about what might be true.

2620
02:28:39.020 --> 02:28:40.070
But the pattern,

2621
02:28:40.071 --> 02:28:44.300
the brain mapping patterns don't fit into nice diagnostic boundaries.
So,

2622
02:28:44.330 --> 02:28:44.690
you know,

2623
02:28:44.690 --> 02:28:48.380
I might see like a really dramatic ADHD pattern and the person reports somewhat

2624
02:28:48.381 --> 02:28:51.680
mild attention problems.
But you know,

2625
02:28:51.681 --> 02:28:56.330
if there's a dramatic outlier,
three,
four standard deviations out of range,

2626
02:28:56.720 --> 02:29:00.980
chances are very good.
That thing is causing you some trouble in some way.

2627
02:29:01.310 --> 02:29:02.121
I would like to do this,

2628
02:29:02.121 --> 02:29:05.330
but I'm worried that I might find that I'm way more fucked up than I think I am.

2629
02:29:05.720 --> 02:29:08.810
Well,
everyone's a little bit fucked up,
you know?
I mean,
all brains are different.

2630
02:29:08.811 --> 02:29:11.150
What about the Dalai Lama?
He's pretty fucked up too.

2631
02:29:11.151 --> 02:29:13.460
He has got that stupid robot didn't heal.

2632
02:29:13.510 --> 02:29:16.790
Do you have a major health crisis recently?
I don't know.
I think he did.
Yeah.

2633
02:29:16.850 --> 02:29:19.580
I just say that I have a friend who had some experience with them,

2634
02:29:19.820 --> 02:29:21.640
so he's kind of full of shit.
Yeah.

2635
02:29:21.690 --> 02:29:25.310
I have a friend who grew up with them actually,
and they grew up together in a,

2636
02:29:25.311 --> 02:29:28.710
in a monastery and uh,
that's hilarious.
He doesn't say much about him,
but,

2637
02:29:28.720 --> 02:29:31.550
but you know,
he's,
he's also Tibetan guy,
so he's pretty chill.

2638
02:29:32.120 --> 02:29:35.910
So it's a weird way to live your life,
uh,

2639
02:29:35.950 --> 02:29:40.220
as the reincarnation of a Godhead,
uh,
a spiritual leader.
Yeah,

2640
02:29:40.390 --> 02:29:43.910
I would say so.
I think Steven Seagal was one of those two,
according to him,

2641
02:29:43.970 --> 02:29:48.710
didn't he gained some sort of reincarnation status?
Did he as an Aikido master?

2642
02:29:48.740 --> 02:29:53.090
I'm sure initially was trained by the guy that was his first teacher.

2643
02:29:53.840 --> 02:29:58.520
And,
um,
that teacher,
I do not like teach us through pain and intimidation.

2644
02:29:59.030 --> 02:30:03.530
Um,
I,
I'm not terribly impressed with as a kito how dare you.

2645
02:30:03.560 --> 02:30:07.550
I know it's,
it makes it,
he's gonna come kick my ass now.
But um,
you know,

2646
02:30:07.580 --> 02:30:10.940
I'm a Nike I a person and that I haven't done it in a few years,
but uh,

2647
02:30:10.970 --> 02:30:15.950
I'm not that impressed with [inaudible] lineage or his onscreen.
Hito wow.

2648
02:30:16.130 --> 02:30:20.030
How rude.
I know,
I know.
I'm such a jerk.
Can't even believe you're saying this.

2649
02:30:20.360 --> 02:30:22.220
Well,
I don't understand the Kido that much,

2650
02:30:22.221 --> 02:30:24.080
so I'm sure you would know more than me.

2651
02:30:24.110 --> 02:30:26.630
To me it looks cool flipping people around.
Sure.
Yeah.

2652
02:30:26.631 --> 02:30:30.560
It looks like you have to cooperate.
It doesn't look very job.
It would work.

2653
02:30:31.040 --> 02:30:35.060
I think if you shot a double on him and got a good grip on your hands,
he's,

2654
02:30:35.240 --> 02:30:38.180
he's going for a ride.
Yeah.
It's,
it's,
you know,

2655
02:30:38.510 --> 02:30:42.650
most of a Keto is learning to recognize force coming at you and not being in the

2656
02:30:42.651 --> 02:30:44.720
way of it.
Right.
He's just,

2657
02:30:44.721 --> 02:30:47.750
just creep up on them slow and punched him in the face as long as you're not

2658
02:30:47.751 --> 02:30:52.640
like running at him like with your hand over your head like,
right.
Exactly.

2659
02:30:52.641 --> 02:30:53.510
Although you know you couldn't,
you know,

2660
02:30:53.540 --> 02:30:57.830
the angle of the hips in the eyes and you can sort of,
there's a lot of,

2661
02:30:57.831 --> 02:31:00.990
the key to like a lot of martial arts is very heavy in the foot work.

2662
02:31:01.370 --> 02:31:04.220
So you need to stepped to one side and pivot around and by the time they've

2663
02:31:04.221 --> 02:31:07.040
swung their fists there overbalanced now and you can just got to,
you know,

2664
02:31:07.100 --> 02:31:11.240
knock them over.
Yeah.
But you take an Ncaa d one wrestler,

2665
02:31:11.840 --> 02:31:14.390
good luck.
Put One of those guys against,
you know,

2666
02:31:14.420 --> 02:31:15.710
oh Sensei or some of the people,

2667
02:31:15.711 --> 02:31:19.220
the pinnacle of the Kido and I'd love to see that against me.

2668
02:31:19.230 --> 02:31:23.940
Kicked my ass against the best guy.
You bring your best guy.

2669
02:31:23.970 --> 02:31:28.920
I don't get there.
They're actually a,
we're in the 70s several videotaped multi,

2670
02:31:28.921 --> 02:31:33.921
a multi martial art competitions expositions between Oh sensai the founder and

2671
02:31:34.471 --> 02:31:38.430
several other principals of other martial arts.
Can you wash it online?
You can,

2672
02:31:38.470 --> 02:31:42.120
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
It was like to watch that.
So how do you say this guy's name?
Oh,

2673
02:31:42.121 --> 02:31:45.030
we say,
oh,
sensei.
Oh.
And in sound seems to be Sensei.

2674
02:31:45.300 --> 02:31:48.780
He has as a name that I remember,
but,
uh,
he was,
he's noticed,
oh,
Sensei and Akita.

2675
02:31:48.810 --> 02:31:51.670
What do you recommend?
A look what videos are one specific problem.

2676
02:31:51.671 --> 02:31:53.550
And I could look at it as an exposition video,

2677
02:31:53.670 --> 02:31:57.120
like the 70s that's sort of the big one that that shows him,
you know,

2678
02:31:57.270 --> 02:32:00.540
knocking people love without touching them and things,
you know,

2679
02:32:00.541 --> 02:32:04.940
it's a little crazy.
A little,
yeah.
But like,
like not,
not his friends,
like,

2680
02:32:04.941 --> 02:32:05.190
you know,

2681
02:32:05.190 --> 02:32:08.250
the karate master from Japan getting knocked over and things without him

2682
02:32:08.251 --> 02:32:11.400
touching them.
Just a few of that worked.
Um,

2683
02:32:11.401 --> 02:32:15.360
and knowing what you know about the mind,
probably because he,
you know,

2684
02:32:15.420 --> 02:32:18.660
gave us subtle cue that made them prepare to move in one way and then switched

2685
02:32:18.661 --> 02:32:21.690
it.
And you know,
they've essentially using their mind against them,

2686
02:32:21.691 --> 02:32:25.650
over balancing them.
You know,
you believe that?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Really.

2687
02:32:25.651 --> 02:32:28.950
You think that a guy can knock a guy over with his mind just by giving them

2688
02:32:28.951 --> 02:32:32.250
subtle cues,
like shifting your weight to the person attacking,

2689
02:32:32.251 --> 02:32:35.130
you've shifted their weight and then move and then moving out of the way it's

2690
02:32:35.131 --> 02:32:37.410
the person falls over.
That doesn't work.

2691
02:32:37.860 --> 02:32:41.190
That is only going to work on someone that doesn't know how to fight 100% well.

2692
02:32:41.191 --> 02:32:42.300
You should look at some of these videos.

2693
02:32:42.340 --> 02:32:44.940
There were a lot of them right now with you.
Okay.
Because,

2694
02:32:44.941 --> 02:32:46.140
let's see if you could pull that up.

2695
02:32:47.040 --> 02:32:51.720
I have a vast extensive experience in watching bullshit,

2696
02:32:52.110 --> 02:32:57.110
especially martial arts bullshit and a lot of it comes from these traditional

2697
02:32:57.361 --> 02:33:02.040
martial artists that claim to be able to anticipate and use people's,
well.

2698
02:33:02.041 --> 02:33:04.680
There's very good claims being made by sentence say in fact,

2699
02:33:04.681 --> 02:33:08.190
and he doesn't claim that he has some ancient lineage that came down from the

2700
02:33:08.191 --> 02:33:08.460
mountain.

2701
02:33:08.460 --> 02:33:12.630
He created it from Tai-chi and Morrison Sword Forms and everything else.

2702
02:33:12.631 --> 02:33:15.570
It's a modern art,
not an ancient art.
Well,
there's some,

2703
02:33:15.600 --> 02:33:17.520
there's some martial arts that are very,

2704
02:33:17.521 --> 02:33:20.220
the ancient martial arts that are very effective and actual hand to hand

2705
02:33:20.221 --> 02:33:24.210
competition.
Like judo for instance,
is very effective.
Jujitsu,
of course,

2706
02:33:24.211 --> 02:33:28.140
a derivative of an Akita.
It's really a hard martial art.
Like,
like a judo.

2707
02:33:28.180 --> 02:33:32.310
I mean like you know is a judicious judo,
Jujitsu.
It's in that category,

2708
02:33:32.610 --> 02:33:36.960
but it's softer than judo or cream food.
Redistribution of energy.
Martial art.

2709
02:33:37.140 --> 02:33:40.760
Take someone's energy,
use it against them.
The issue is,
is this the gentleman?

2710
02:33:40.761 --> 02:33:45.510
So sensei?
Yeah.
So this is someone coming at them.
Okay,
this is terrible.

2711
02:33:46.140 --> 02:33:48.870
Show me something good because this guy doesn't know what the fuck he's doing.

2712
02:33:48.871 --> 02:33:51.310
All kinds of running into him.
So this is the thing with all these,

2713
02:33:51.340 --> 02:33:55.320
these goddamn demonstrations.
Is that guys willingly corroborating well,
yeah.

2714
02:33:55.370 --> 02:33:58.440
I mean look at that.
He's practicing the technique and the technique.

2715
02:33:58.441 --> 02:34:01.890
You either cooperate or your arm breaks.
Well,
this isn't even cooperating.

2716
02:34:01.891 --> 02:34:04.650
This guy's throwing himself on the ground.
So silly.

2717
02:34:05.610 --> 02:34:09.060
This guy's a running towards him and letting this guy clothes line.
I'm come on.

2718
02:34:09.061 --> 02:34:12.090
That doesn't ever happen.
The guys just standing there.

2719
02:34:12.330 --> 02:34:15.780
This would never work against a trained fighter.
Never.

2720
02:34:15.781 --> 02:34:17.830
Not in a million years.

2721
02:34:18.130 --> 02:34:20.830
<v 2>You get an Ncaa Division one wrestler,</v>

2722
02:34:21.220 --> 02:34:24.640
he's going to shoot on this guy and this guy is going to be on his head in

2723
02:34:24.641 --> 02:34:29.090
seconds.
It just doesn't work.
This is,
I mean this is what I'm looking at.

2724
02:34:29.110 --> 02:34:30.300
I'm looking at the time.
Well you're,

2725
02:34:30.310 --> 02:34:34.160
you're looking at people practicing techniques,
not a multi see the multi,

2726
02:34:34.660 --> 02:34:38.500
what should he look for?
A exposition,
I think.
And I think it was in Japan.

2727
02:34:38.690 --> 02:34:43.420
Maybe an exhibition or exposition.
Uh,
exhibition.
Exhibition.

2728
02:34:43.450 --> 02:34:45.070
Not Exposition.
Yeah.

2729
02:34:45.910 --> 02:34:50.320
Exhibition telling me one of those looks a,

2730
02:34:52.200 --> 02:34:55.350
and then I think he'd,
he'd put either judo or karate and you'll also find it,

2731
02:34:55.351 --> 02:35:00.351
cause it was a multi martial art meeting in the 70s there's a lot of fuckery

2732
02:35:00.811 --> 02:35:04.860
when it comes to martial arts and a lot of people that get trapped into all this

2733
02:35:04.861 --> 02:35:05.181
fuckery.

2734
02:35:05.181 --> 02:35:08.780
And I've met a lot of people that are very intelligent people that swear at

2735
02:35:08.790 --> 02:35:12.270
their Sensei is the guy that has the answers to all this jazz.

2736
02:35:12.780 --> 02:35:15.720
And I just have,
I've seen too much.

2737
02:35:15.780 --> 02:35:18.630
I know how much of it is based on predisposed,

2738
02:35:18.930 --> 02:35:23.040
predetermined ideas that you have about this person's abilities.

2739
02:35:23.130 --> 02:35:27.510
I make no claims about,
you know,
my Sensei's the people I've learned from being,

2740
02:35:27.511 --> 02:35:31.890
you know,
from on high the first day I rode a motorcycle.

2741
02:35:32.010 --> 02:35:36.240
I crashed it when flying through the air and was standing on my feet watching

2742
02:35:36.241 --> 02:35:40.500
the bike spin away because I was doing a Keto so much.
Oh,
I'm sure.

2743
02:35:40.501 --> 02:35:42.330
Well that's balance.
You know,
and you can,

2744
02:35:42.360 --> 02:35:44.190
there's a lot of videos of guys getting,

2745
02:35:44.191 --> 02:35:47.670
there's a great video of a guy getting rear ended while he's on a bike.

2746
02:35:47.671 --> 02:35:50.440
He flips through the air and lands on his feet.
Yeah.
And it just,
yeah,

2747
02:35:50.460 --> 02:35:52.680
it was thrown.
I landed on my shoulder on the,

2748
02:35:52.740 --> 02:35:56.340
on a street on tar and it was standing up watching the bike spin away with one

2749
02:35:56.341 --> 02:36:00.940
little tiny tear in my shoulder because I took the force of being thrown a,

2750
02:36:01.030 --> 02:36:03.060
the way I had my,
my body had been trained.
Well,

2751
02:36:03.061 --> 02:36:06.990
I'm definitely not saying that learning how to fall isn't a huge skill to have.

2752
02:36:06.991 --> 02:36:08.820
If you want to ride a motorcycle and fall down.

2753
02:36:09.180 --> 02:36:14.180
Learning how to fall is a big part of both judo and Jujitsu and a kito and a lot

2754
02:36:14.941 --> 02:36:18.840
of different martial arts.
But this motherfucker's not stopping anybody.
Okay.

2755
02:36:18.850 --> 02:36:22.950
Get him down telling you right now that'll do was close line technique.

2756
02:36:23.540 --> 02:36:26.570
Well this is hard to see what that kind of shit demonstrates.

2757
02:36:27.190 --> 02:36:31.050
It's also hard to pick apart,
you know,
from,
from here.

2758
02:36:31.320 --> 02:36:34.640
If you were in the,
in the Dojo watching the footwork,

2759
02:36:34.650 --> 02:36:37.470
you might perceive a little bit differently.

2760
02:36:38.240 --> 02:36:41.720
We're watching someone who is not a 90 year old guy with uh,
with uh,
with uh,
uh,

2761
02:36:41.780 --> 02:36:45.910
um,
uh,
polite student.
Right.
You know,
there are different,
uh,

2762
02:36:46.320 --> 02:36:49.440
that's why I want to see some real shit.
I've never seen it.
I've,

2763
02:36:49.441 --> 02:36:50.880
I've every single one of those,
I mean,

2764
02:36:50.881 --> 02:36:54.270
I've seen some judo demonstrations where there was one that we played recently

2765
02:36:54.271 --> 02:36:59.160
was amazing.
There's this old Judah,
but the way he moved was logical.
I mean,

2766
02:36:59.161 --> 02:37:01.850
I understood that what he was doing was effective.
Yeah.

2767
02:37:01.920 --> 02:37:04.980
Based on my knowledge of the human body and movement.
That's not,

2768
02:37:05.010 --> 02:37:07.710
that's I'm done watching some cooperation there.

2769
02:37:07.711 --> 02:37:11.820
I'm watching the guy run into this guy's punches or this guy's forearms.

2770
02:37:12.540 --> 02:37:13.770
Got Anything Jammy?
No.

2771
02:37:15.000 --> 02:37:17.990
<v 4>Uh,
Turkish wrestler versus a keep it open.</v>

2772
02:37:18.420 --> 02:37:22.830
<v 2>Okay,
that sounds interesting.
Yeah.
A Turkish wrestler versus an ICO guy.</v>

2773
02:37:23.010 --> 02:37:27.330
Okay.
Let's say first of all,
the wrestle looks like he's about 60

2774
02:37:29.160 --> 02:37:31.110
and who knows if he's really a wrestler.

2775
02:37:32.760 --> 02:37:36.510
Take some town like I thought mount.
Exactly.
That's what I'm saying.

2776
02:37:36.540 --> 02:37:40.050
Tap some head and arm choke.
That's what I thought.
Now let's see this again.

2777
02:37:41.310 --> 02:37:41.850
<v 4>Okay.</v>

2778
02:37:41.850 --> 02:37:44.250
<v 2>Okay.
He's going to try it again.
Okay.
Here he goes,</v>

2779
02:37:46.860 --> 02:37:51.130
grabs him,
throws him to the ground again.
Grabs him,
drove him to the ground.
Yeah.

2780
02:37:51.150 --> 02:37:53.910
This is what I expected.
Exactly.
See,

2781
02:37:53.940 --> 02:37:58.260
this is what happens in real life.
This is what happens.
This is an arm bar.

2782
02:37:58.560 --> 02:38:01.410
This is a guy is not even good at armbars and needs the left leg over the face.

2783
02:38:02.030 --> 02:38:03.330
That's,
that's reality.

2784
02:38:03.360 --> 02:38:07.500
This shit doesn't work and it's a beautiful art to practice.

2785
02:38:07.501 --> 02:38:08.370
It looks cool,

2786
02:38:08.400 --> 02:38:13.030
but it's like as far as like efficacy and actual grappling against the scale,

2787
02:38:13.560 --> 02:38:15.480
but the goal is not skilled grappling.

2788
02:38:15.481 --> 02:38:19.200
The goal is to learn how force works when your body's flying through the air.

2789
02:38:19.320 --> 02:38:21.420
Right.
And when someone's punching in the face,

2790
02:38:21.570 --> 02:38:24.030
I learned how that force coming at you to be safe.

2791
02:38:24.420 --> 02:38:28.050
The goal is not to strike many I kido places don't even teach much in the way of

2792
02:38:28.060 --> 02:38:31.590
attacks.
Well that guy wasn't striking him.
That guy just grabbed him.
Right.

2793
02:38:31.620 --> 02:38:36.420
But I'm saying that it's not a me against you conflict art.

2794
02:38:36.450 --> 02:38:36.931
It is.

2795
02:38:36.931 --> 02:38:40.290
Let's work on playing around with forces that are moving between us together.

2796
02:38:41.010 --> 02:38:42.360
I totally understand that.

2797
02:38:42.361 --> 02:38:47.220
And I think it was initially developed to disarm people with a weapon when

2798
02:38:47.221 --> 02:38:50.580
someone would come at you with a weapon to use the energy of that weapon to take

2799
02:38:50.581 --> 02:38:54.510
it away from them.
I just think as far as an actual martial art,

2800
02:38:54.511 --> 02:38:59.400
it's one of the least effective in real practice.
I mean,
yeah,
but again,

2801
02:38:59.401 --> 02:39:02.710
the goal is not necessarily face to face combat.
You know,
if you,

2802
02:39:02.730 --> 02:39:07.520
you can pick other things that are more military and are trying to kill the,

2803
02:39:07.550 --> 02:39:08.101
what the goal is,

2804
02:39:08.101 --> 02:39:10.640
kill the goal is not killing or meeting force with force that goals,

2805
02:39:10.650 --> 02:39:12.250
keeping people safe.
Right.

2806
02:39:12.270 --> 02:39:17.270
I Quito life is to kill you or kill your opponent as quickly as possible.

2807
02:39:18.300 --> 02:39:19.131
Well that's why I labeled them.

2808
02:39:19.131 --> 02:39:22.020
That's why I brought up wrestling because wrestling the goals and kill you

2809
02:39:22.021 --> 02:39:23.250
either wrestling the goal,

2810
02:39:25.320 --> 02:39:28.800
well the goal is to control,
control your body,

2811
02:39:28.830 --> 02:39:31.980
which would be probably the most effective way to avoid getting hurt.

2812
02:39:32.010 --> 02:39:34.950
If you have someone coming at you,
if you can control their body,

2813
02:39:34.951 --> 02:39:38.490
they can't harm her.
Sure.
But controlling yourself is probably the,
the,

2814
02:39:38.540 --> 02:39:41.760
the higher,
uh,
focus on acute,
I would say.

2815
02:39:42.000 --> 02:39:46.650
I think you're fucking binds Mumbo jumbo.
Maybe.
Maybe.
Got You.
Maybe they do.

2816
02:39:46.680 --> 02:39:48.400
Maybe I've been,
I've been indoctrinated.
Wow.

2817
02:39:48.401 --> 02:39:52.770
This is still a long history of that stuff where it's like a part of people's,

2818
02:39:52.810 --> 02:39:54.780
a map of the world.
You know,

2819
02:39:54.781 --> 02:39:58.470
you have your model of the world of what's effective and what's not effective.

2820
02:39:58.470 --> 02:39:59.820
And one of the,

2821
02:40:00.170 --> 02:40:03.300
there's a lot of people that don't like the idea of mixed martial arts because

2822
02:40:03.301 --> 02:40:07.810
it's not in,
in many ways it's not traditional martial arts.
And some of the,
uh,

2823
02:40:08.370 --> 02:40:12.240
some of the positive benefits of traditional martial arts have sort of been cast

2824
02:40:12.241 --> 02:40:16.650
aside in favor of Mohawk tattooed savages.
Right?
Right.

2825
02:40:16.690 --> 02:40:21.690
But the reality is a lot of the ideas that powered those traditional martial

2826
02:40:22.441 --> 02:40:24.240
arts beliefs are bullshit.

2827
02:40:24.690 --> 02:40:27.960
And we thought they were real for a long time and there was only one way to find

2828
02:40:27.961 --> 02:40:30.330
out if they were real.
And that was competition.

2829
02:40:30.690 --> 02:40:35.690
And in competition you find that the reality is most of that stuff doesn't work.

2830
02:40:36.180 --> 02:40:41.010
But that's also competition.
I mean,
I've been attacked in bars,
you know,
spend,

2831
02:40:41.011 --> 02:40:43.050
grabs you in a bar and before they know it,

2832
02:40:43.051 --> 02:40:46.680
I'm standing next to them and they're not interested in attacking me anymore

2833
02:40:46.681 --> 02:40:49.890
because their wrist is,
you know,
in pain or they're on the ground or you know,

2834
02:40:49.891 --> 02:40:53.190
that that's happened to me.
I've used this stuff in real world environments,

2835
02:40:53.670 --> 02:40:57.360
not against some like,
you know,
professional wrestlers coming at me,

2836
02:40:57.361 --> 02:41:01.530
but against some asshole.
And a bar.
Right.
You know,
it's uh,
it's,

2837
02:41:01.531 --> 02:41:04.020
it's very valid.
It's very useful.
Okay.

2838
02:41:04.500 --> 02:41:08.100
What that means to me is it works great as long as the guy doesn't know what the

2839
02:41:08.101 --> 02:41:08.934
fuck he's doing.

2840
02:41:09.450 --> 02:41:13.800
Well we know martial arts isn't going to walk around trying to kick people's

2841
02:41:13.801 --> 02:41:16.920
asses.
That's what an unskilled asshole does.
Yeah.
But it's not,

2842
02:41:17.730 --> 02:41:18.660
that's not the point.

2843
02:41:18.900 --> 02:41:22.320
But that's not necessarily the true cause you could run into someone who was an

2844
02:41:22.321 --> 02:41:25.950
asshole who's skilled and just they have issues they have,

2845
02:41:25.980 --> 02:41:27.930
maybe they could have emotional issues.

2846
02:41:27.931 --> 02:41:31.560
There's a lot of people that are skilled fighters that go and pick fights,

2847
02:41:31.890 --> 02:41:35.910
I suppose.
And if you have Ikea Edo and they have that,

2848
02:41:35.940 --> 02:41:38.790
you're going to get fucked up.
No,
cause I'm not gonna engage with their fight.

2849
02:41:38.791 --> 02:41:40.620
I'm going to step aside when they,
you know,

2850
02:41:40.800 --> 02:41:43.200
and also these guys are drinking beer in the bar.
They're getting there.
They're,

2851
02:41:43.201 --> 02:41:45.190
they're drunk.
And you're in the bar too.
But I don't,
but I,

2852
02:41:45.200 --> 02:41:48.150
I don't get out of control with alcohol.
You're assuming they do though.

2853
02:41:48.480 --> 02:41:51.390
I think absolutely.
I'm assuming they knew martial arts.

2854
02:41:51.480 --> 02:41:56.010
We'll work on trained killers and a kito just doesn't,
okay.

2855
02:41:57.780 --> 02:42:00.600
It's just,
I don't want to shatter beliefs,
but this is,
uh,

2856
02:42:00.800 --> 02:42:05.800
an important subject to me because it's something that I went through my entire

2857
02:42:05.911 --> 02:42:07.850
adult life and as a young man,
I,

2858
02:42:07.860 --> 02:42:11.100
I kinda went through the broad spectrum of what to believe in,

2859
02:42:11.101 --> 02:42:12.270
what not to be even.

2860
02:42:12.420 --> 02:42:15.850
I have no problem that is not a competitive martial art and you know,
it doesn't,

2861
02:42:15.960 --> 02:42:20.910
it doesn't work the way wrestling or,
or a Krav Maga or karate or judo.

2862
02:42:21.970 --> 02:42:25.830
I'm okay with it being not a practical as those,

2863
02:42:26.190 --> 02:42:30.630
I still think there's incredible benefit in learning to use your body and keep

2864
02:42:30.631 --> 02:42:32.880
yourself safe in a crisis environment.
Well,
there's,

2865
02:42:32.881 --> 02:42:34.890
there's benefit in gymnastics.
You know,

2866
02:42:34.891 --> 02:42:39.300
there's a benefit in a lot of different things that I would look,
one of the best

2867
02:42:40.920 --> 02:42:45.580
platforms for going into Jujitsu,
we've were recently finding his breakdancing.

2868
02:42:45.920 --> 02:42:48.030
Hmm.
These breakdancing guys,

2869
02:42:48.240 --> 02:42:51.360
there's a whole team of them from 10th Planet Jiu Jitsu that started out as

2870
02:42:51.361 --> 02:42:52.080
breakdancers.

2871
02:42:52.080 --> 02:42:56.070
And these guys have these incredible athletic ability because they learned how

2872
02:42:56.071 --> 02:43:00.480
to support themselves on one hand and hand stands and spin around and they can

2873
02:43:00.481 --> 02:43:03.300
manipulate their bodies and these incredibly unique ways.

2874
02:43:03.450 --> 02:43:07.650
And these guys mean you'd never think of break dancing being a martial art,

2875
02:43:07.950 --> 02:43:12.160
but one once these guys learned basic positions,
there are so good

2876
02:43:12.160 --> 02:43:15.220
<v 0>at them because they're,
I would say that the same is true for Nike Doka.</v>

2877
02:43:15.230 --> 02:43:17.690
You can take someone who's learned that and put them in a more,
you know,

2878
02:43:17.710 --> 02:43:18.521
hard form.

2879
02:43:18.521 --> 02:43:23.521
They're going to have skills that descend from balanced posture,

2880
02:43:23.531 --> 02:43:26.980
moving around your center and moving from a strong ploys.
I would agree.

2881
02:43:27.070 --> 02:43:29.350
I would agree.
You know,
certainly I just would,

2882
02:43:29.620 --> 02:43:33.040
I would be real concern and this is one of the reasons why I'm so adamant about

2883
02:43:33.041 --> 02:43:33.760
this.

2884
02:43:33.760 --> 02:43:38.760
I'm very nervous about people getting inaccurate ideas on their head and I've

2885
02:43:38.801 --> 02:43:41.290
seen it in action.
I mean,
we used to have guys,

2886
02:43:41.291 --> 02:43:44.380
when I was my competition days,

2887
02:43:44.410 --> 02:43:49.410
they would come to the gym that had come from some crazy kung fu martial art

2888
02:43:50.201 --> 02:43:54.070
where they had this distorted perception of reality and they would spar with

2889
02:43:54.071 --> 02:43:56.550
people who actually knew how to fight and they would get knocked out.

2890
02:43:56.560 --> 02:43:59.380
It's just horrible to watch because they had this idea in their head of who they

2891
02:43:59.381 --> 02:44:01.960
were.
And then in practice it just didn't work.

2892
02:44:02.250 --> 02:44:06.340
Like Quito Center has an idea of themselves as a sparring fighter.

2893
02:44:06.820 --> 02:44:07.840
That's not what they have.

2894
02:44:07.841 --> 02:44:11.050
The idea of themselves as how well they would be able to keep something away

2895
02:44:11.051 --> 02:44:12.460
from them.
Uh,
yeah.

2896
02:44:12.461 --> 02:44:15.880
If somebody grabs them or comes running out there that we just saw a guy tackled

2897
02:44:15.881 --> 02:44:18.120
over and over again,
very easily shared.
But the,
you know,

2898
02:44:18.160 --> 02:44:20.800
I wouldn't let that guy tackled me.
I just,
I just wouldn't have been there.

2899
02:44:21.220 --> 02:44:23.050
What do you mean you wouldn't have been there?
He would've come at me.

2900
02:44:23.051 --> 02:44:24.400
I would've stepped to one side.

2901
02:44:24.460 --> 02:44:27.790
And just not what you think that guy wanted to do that?
No cause he was,

2902
02:44:27.791 --> 02:44:30.790
he was trying for a specific technique.
He just like grabbed my arm and I'll,

2903
02:44:30.850 --> 02:44:32.110
I'll do the technique I'm thinking of.

2904
02:44:32.140 --> 02:44:35.590
So do you think that if you were in a mad at room with someone who's a trained

2905
02:44:35.591 --> 02:44:38.980
grapple,
you'd be able to keep them away from you for longer than that guy?
Yeah.

2906
02:44:39.880 --> 02:44:43.480
Yeah.
Maybe not much longer.
Yeah.
You got to try that.

2907
02:44:43.481 --> 02:44:46.030
A lot of people have ideas in their head of what is possible,

2908
02:44:46.420 --> 02:44:48.270
but you got to put that in action.

2909
02:44:48.310 --> 02:44:52.310
I'm also heavily trained in restraining people.
How so?
I mean,

2910
02:44:52.320 --> 02:44:55.200
I restrain people in psych hospitals for several years.
That was my job.

2911
02:44:55.390 --> 02:44:59.590
Crazy people flipping out and throwing chairs,
you know,
six foot,
five,

2912
02:44:59.591 --> 02:45:03.580
300 pound people that I can restrain them alone often or with one other person.

2913
02:45:03.880 --> 02:45:04.061
You know,

2914
02:45:04.061 --> 02:45:06.700
one of the things that I think will be really interesting to talk to you about

2915
02:45:06.701 --> 02:45:11.701
it specifically is what is going on in the mindset of someone who is engaging in

2916
02:45:12.281 --> 02:45:17.281
conflict because one of the most important aspects of any physical altercation

2917
02:45:18.190 --> 02:45:22.090
is being able to keep your wits about you.
Yeah.
Um,
you know,

2918
02:45:22.091 --> 02:45:26.590
violence conflict causes a huge surge in adrenaline,

2919
02:45:26.890 --> 02:45:27.611
cortisol,

2920
02:45:27.611 --> 02:45:32.430
which is a stress hormone and it shuts down the connections between the,

2921
02:45:32.450 --> 02:45:33.340
the executive,

2922
02:45:33.341 --> 02:45:37.390
the CEO of the brain and the other parts of the brain that we sort of have a

2923
02:45:37.400 --> 02:45:40.150
dual track brain or mind almost.

2924
02:45:40.151 --> 02:45:45.151
We have topped down resources and bottom up resources says automatic things that

2925
02:45:45.521 --> 02:45:48.070
happened.
Like I can't look at the picture behind you about seeing it.

2926
02:45:48.460 --> 02:45:51.610
The bottom up,
it's automatic and then there's top down.
You know,

2927
02:45:51.640 --> 02:45:56.210
how I interpret what I'm seeing or how I decide to feel about it.
That's bought,

2928
02:45:56.220 --> 02:45:59.200
you know,
a top down versus bottom up.
Um,

2929
02:46:00.490 --> 02:46:05.290
a lot of the bottom up stuff and crisis and violence is what takes over and the

2930
02:46:05.291 --> 02:46:08.950
top down ability to,
for your,
your intentions,
your perceptions,

2931
02:46:08.960 --> 02:46:13.960
your moment to moment perspective on your brain or on your reality that goes

2932
02:46:14.301 --> 02:46:16.160
away in a crisis.
And the PFC,

2933
02:46:16.161 --> 02:46:19.580
the prefrontal cortex gets shut down or least it's connections between the PFC

2934
02:46:19.581 --> 02:46:23.570
and the rest of the brain gets shut down a little bit and you go into automatic

2935
02:46:23.660 --> 02:46:24.800
deal with the crisis mode.

2936
02:46:24.860 --> 02:46:29.450
I wish we could monitor that in competitive martial arts contest because I've

2937
02:46:29.451 --> 02:46:34.340
seen it time and time again where people are professionals and they have a long

2938
02:46:34.341 --> 02:46:37.910
experience of competition,
but they get to the big event,

2939
02:46:37.940 --> 02:46:41.120
whether it's fighting for the world championship,
fighting a contender,

2940
02:46:41.240 --> 02:46:44.810
the main event on a big show and they freeze.
Totally see,

2941
02:46:44.990 --> 02:46:48.030
you see the nerves you see readily kicks up and you know,
yeah,

2942
02:46:48.050 --> 02:46:51.610
I used to be in college,
I was a fencer,
uh,
and I fenced a lot,
you know,

2943
02:46:51.800 --> 02:46:53.680
weapons and um,

2944
02:46:53.990 --> 02:46:56.450
most of the time it's pretty chill and lefthanded which has an advantage in

2945
02:46:56.451 --> 02:47:00.110
fencing often.
And so I was pretty,
I was pretty good at,
at my school,

2946
02:47:00.111 --> 02:47:01.310
I was one of the better people.

2947
02:47:01.580 --> 02:47:05.750
But then you go to these big events and the adrenaline kicks in and there's,

2948
02:47:05.800 --> 02:47:09.840
you know,
spectators,
the crowd,
it's a very different environment.
You know,

2949
02:47:09.860 --> 02:47:14.840
I can state dependent learning where you learn skills in one set of contexts.

2950
02:47:15.200 --> 02:47:18.290
And if the context change too much,
the skills may not be there.

2951
02:47:18.740 --> 02:47:23.150
So these fighters who get to the big event haven't practiced in the big event

2952
02:47:23.151 --> 02:47:26.900
room or with enough noise or enough flooding or enough,
you know,

2953
02:47:26.901 --> 02:47:28.790
caring about the fight,
right.

2954
02:47:28.850 --> 02:47:32.120
To the point where they can bring the same resources online that they learned.

2955
02:47:32.410 --> 02:47:33.860
You know,
it's like musicians.
Uh,

2956
02:47:34.070 --> 02:47:37.070
I'm sure you know some musicians who can't play unless they're stoned because

2957
02:47:37.071 --> 02:47:41.270
that's the only way they've ever played music.
Bri state dependent learning.

2958
02:47:41.271 --> 02:47:43.310
So that's,
that's a,
that's always overblown.

2959
02:47:43.311 --> 02:47:45.560
It's not quite as dramatic and effect as we think it is.

2960
02:47:45.590 --> 02:47:48.260
You see it with standup comedy too.
You see some,

2961
02:47:48.470 --> 02:47:51.710
sometimes people can work well with small crowds,
very little pressure.

2962
02:47:51.711 --> 02:47:53.460
And then if you put them in front of a large crowd there,

2963
02:47:54.370 --> 02:47:56.480
you literally see them constrict.
Yeah.

2964
02:47:56.481 --> 02:48:00.770
And some of that's the sweet spot they're used to living in,
right?
There's the,

2965
02:48:00.771 --> 02:48:03.080
there's the stress response curve.
It's an inverted u,

2966
02:48:03.140 --> 02:48:05.750
the Yerkes Dodson curve and a little bit of stress.

2967
02:48:05.751 --> 02:48:07.910
It's a stress versus performance on two axes.

2968
02:48:08.120 --> 02:48:11.660
A little bit of stress means better performance,
a little more stress,

2969
02:48:11.661 --> 02:48:14.300
better performance,
a little more stress,
performance plateaus.

2970
02:48:14.570 --> 02:48:15.560
A little more stress,

2971
02:48:15.800 --> 02:48:19.670
performance degrades and this can be like stress or is like I'm stressed out or

2972
02:48:19.671 --> 02:48:23.060
just physiological arousal,
heart beating,
you know,
getting ready to do something.

2973
02:48:24.380 --> 02:48:27.470
A little bit of this stuff is good.
A lot of it is not good.

2974
02:48:27.471 --> 02:48:29.210
And if you're not used to existing,

2975
02:48:29.211 --> 02:48:32.390
not used to performing in a mode on the far end of that curve,

2976
02:48:32.600 --> 02:48:34.840
your performance is gone.
Yeah.

2977
02:48:34.860 --> 02:48:39.860
Seems like there's a wall that they hit that's unexpected and then they just get

2978
02:48:41.001 --> 02:48:44.360
this like,
I didn't think this wall was going to be there.
Now what?
Well,

2979
02:48:44.361 --> 02:48:47.900
they used to performing somewhere in the top of the curve where they're stressed

2980
02:48:47.901 --> 02:48:51.650
out enough or there are physiologically aroused enough to perform very,

2981
02:48:51.651 --> 02:48:55.970
very well,
but a little more stress reaction times down,

2982
02:48:56.330 --> 02:48:59.360
judgments,
down,
awareness,
memory,
learning.

2983
02:48:59.361 --> 02:49:01.070
All these things are impaired in that sense.

2984
02:49:01.071 --> 02:49:04.670
Do you think there's anything that you could do that would help athletes compete

2985
02:49:04.671 --> 02:49:08.760
under massive amounts of pressure?
Yeah,
I do actually.
Um,
this sleep spend,

2986
02:49:08.761 --> 02:49:10.530
all that we tend to train up called Smr,

2987
02:49:10.531 --> 02:49:14.850
sensory motor rhythm in the brain seems to improve athletic performance.

2988
02:49:14.851 --> 02:49:18.660
It's used a lot in golfers who are trying to get in the zone.
Um,
and the way,

2989
02:49:18.661 --> 02:49:22.170
and you know,
most neurofeedback is as non voluntary operant shaping,

2990
02:49:22.171 --> 02:49:23.010
but with golfers,

2991
02:49:23.011 --> 02:49:26.580
you follow them around the golf course with a laptop and when their brain goes

2992
02:49:26.581 --> 02:49:30.930
in and they get ready to,
they tee up and get ready to strike the ball,
um,

2993
02:49:32.100 --> 02:49:35.730
and then they wait until the computer makes a noise and tells them,
okay,

2994
02:49:35.731 --> 02:49:38.280
you're in the zone now.
And then they release and you hit the ball.

2995
02:49:38.490 --> 02:49:38.940
And so they're,

2996
02:49:38.940 --> 02:49:42.720
they're trying to associate being in the feeling of being in the zone with

2997
02:49:42.721 --> 02:49:45.600
performing,
with,
you know,
delivering the,
the golf pulse,

2998
02:49:45.790 --> 02:49:48.360
the club swing or something.
Is it one of those things,

2999
02:49:48.361 --> 02:49:51.810
it's very difficult to replicate because a lot of times being in the zone means

3000
02:49:51.811 --> 02:49:54.860
almost like you're,
you're in that Zen state,
right?

3001
02:49:54.900 --> 02:49:57.780
Which is why you're training the brain to go there again and again and again and

3002
02:49:57.781 --> 02:50:00.150
to know,
and you're,
and you're giving an audit,
an audio cue.

3003
02:50:00.180 --> 02:50:03.510
So you start to recognize,
oh,
that tone means zone.

3004
02:50:03.930 --> 02:50:08.130
That's what it feels like right now.
Okay.
And if you reinforce that association,

3005
02:50:08.131 --> 02:50:10.590
if you pointing at that state and sang up there it is,

3006
02:50:10.650 --> 02:50:14.520
there's your brains in that state,
you get sort of more able to access.

3007
02:50:14.521 --> 02:50:18.360
It is a difficult term to replicate when you have a guy there with a laptop,

3008
02:50:18.361 --> 02:50:20.670
it seems like a for,
for golfing and is,

3009
02:50:20.690 --> 02:50:25.080
there's several sports and performance oriented neurofeedback approaches these

3010
02:50:25.080 --> 02:50:27.450
days and they all are somewhat similar,
you know,

3011
02:50:27.690 --> 02:50:31.710
reducing the stress response and increasing attention to keep you in that sweet

3012
02:50:31.711 --> 02:50:33.090
spot to some extent.
You know,

3013
02:50:33.091 --> 02:50:37.560
it would be fascinating if you monitored the brainwaves of fighters leading

3014
02:50:37.561 --> 02:50:38.810
right up to the moment you got,

3015
02:50:38.880 --> 02:50:41.640
they got into the cage and then take the equipment off of them,

3016
02:50:41.670 --> 02:50:45.450
let them compete and then find out where the winners were when they stepped in

3017
02:50:45.451 --> 02:50:47.850
and were the losers were that might work.

3018
02:50:47.851 --> 02:50:52.710
I'm the brain off sometimes changes states very,
very quickly.
And so,
you know,

3019
02:50:52.711 --> 02:50:57.380
because it's a lead up to an event,
you probably would get relevant data.
Um,

3020
02:50:57.530 --> 02:50:58.980
but you know,
I,
you're right,

3021
02:50:58.981 --> 02:51:01.850
you have to take the equipment off when you're actually physically moving
around.

3022
02:51:01.851 --> 02:51:03.300
So especially if you're going to get hit,

3023
02:51:03.660 --> 02:51:06.820
I just movement muscles are also electrical.
Okay.

3024
02:51:07.290 --> 02:51:10.020
And so any muscle movement causes a burst of noise,

3025
02:51:10.021 --> 02:51:12.090
which swamps the brain measurements.

3026
02:51:12.150 --> 02:51:14.850
So you would get a lot of noise even if they're warming up.
Yeah,

3027
02:51:14.851 --> 02:51:16.770
it wouldn't really work.
Yeah,
pretty much.

3028
02:51:16.830 --> 02:51:20.640
So you'd have to kind of measure them like in stillness as they were about to

3029
02:51:20.641 --> 02:51:23.390
step into the cage and that would take too much time.
It might not.
I mean,

3030
02:51:23.400 --> 02:51:25.280
depends on what you're measuring.
When I do assessments,

3031
02:51:25.290 --> 02:51:27.960
it's a full head of EEG and gel caps and things,

3032
02:51:27.961 --> 02:51:31.590
but you can stick a single wire and ear clip on someone's head and measure EEG.

3033
02:51:31.620 --> 02:51:35.670
How long would it take?
30 seconds.
That might be worth studying,

3034
02:51:35.810 --> 02:51:40.320
but the measure for 32nd baseline or something?
Yeah,
I don't know.

3035
02:51:40.321 --> 02:51:41.370
I don't know enough about it,

3036
02:51:41.371 --> 02:51:43.950
but I would think that there would be some interesting data that you would get

3037
02:51:44.280 --> 02:51:46.800
based on.
I mean it would be really fascinating if we found out,
well,

3038
02:51:46.801 --> 02:51:48.930
look at this.
All of the winners.

3039
02:51:48.990 --> 02:51:52.680
We're in this zone and all of the losers were in this area.
Yeah,

3040
02:51:52.681 --> 02:51:57.120
you'd probably find increased fast alpha sort of flow state.
Um,
you know,

3041
02:51:57.121 --> 02:52:02.000
a lot of Beta but not a lot of very fast beta.
So focus but not anxiety.
Um,

3042
02:52:02.340 --> 02:52:05.770
probably very low amount of slow brainwaves like Delta and which happened when

3043
02:52:05.771 --> 02:52:10.600
you're dreaming or creative or checked out.
So my guess is,
as you know,

3044
02:52:10.630 --> 02:52:15.610
the performance would be correlated with better access to flow states and focus

3045
02:52:15.611 --> 02:52:20.170
states and less presence of anxiety states and distractable states.

3046
02:52:20.970 --> 02:52:23.790
<v 2>There's so much to learn when it comes to the human mind.</v>

3047
02:52:23.791 --> 02:52:28.791
This is such a fascinating subject of conversation because most people have no

3048
02:52:29.431 --> 02:52:31.980
idea of what's going on below the surface.

3049
02:52:31.981 --> 02:52:36.120
It's like we have this unbelievably powerful supercomputer that's running our

3050
02:52:36.121 --> 02:52:39.560
reality and we don't have a clue as to how to operate it.

3051
02:52:39.561 --> 02:52:42.810
The most complicated machine,
we know about three pounds,

3052
02:52:42.811 --> 02:52:47.280
but more connections in the brain.
Then there are stars in the galaxy.

3053
02:52:47.730 --> 02:52:52.230
Yeah.
When I did this,
a infinite monkey cage with Brian Cox recently,

3054
02:52:52.290 --> 02:52:55.650
and they were talking about how much more complex a frog is in the universe.

3055
02:52:55.770 --> 02:52:58.950
Yeah,
I'm like,
I'm done.
I can't.
You can't.
Radically,

3056
02:52:58.951 --> 02:53:02.550
the human brain can store more bits of information than there are atoms in the

3057
02:53:02.551 --> 02:53:03.384
universe.

3058
02:53:05.360 --> 02:53:07.070
<v 0>Now we don't store all that information,</v>

3059
02:53:07.071 --> 02:53:09.120
but we're never going to run out of storage space.
The,

3060
02:53:09.280 --> 02:53:13.210
and this is a bit of a cheat,
but the,
the rubric for that is,
um,

3061
02:53:13.240 --> 02:53:15.230
you take the number of neurons,
you have,
let's say $100 billion,

3062
02:53:15.231 --> 02:53:16.520
we have more but 100 billion,

3063
02:53:17.150 --> 02:53:19.760
and you think about the connections they can make with other neurons.

3064
02:53:20.180 --> 02:53:22.580
So a hundred billion neurons tied to a hundred billion neurons,

3065
02:53:22.790 --> 02:53:25.160
and let's ignore recurrent connections.

3066
02:53:25.161 --> 02:53:27.800
And then let's ignore our connections from one neuron to multiple,

3067
02:53:27.801 --> 02:53:31.100
which does absolutely happen.
It's actually the rule versus the exception.

3068
02:53:31.790 --> 02:53:33.650
And let's ignore the fact that glial cells,

3069
02:53:33.651 --> 02:53:36.590
which are also in brain cells are also computational.

3070
02:53:36.620 --> 02:53:40.640
Let's just take the neurons and just take the neurons connected to all the

3071
02:53:40.641 --> 02:53:41.151
neurons.

3072
02:53:41.151 --> 02:53:45.740
So number of neurons raised to the power of the number of neurons.

3073
02:53:45.800 --> 02:53:47.660
So $100 billion raised the power of 100 billion.

3074
02:53:48.080 --> 02:53:51.350
That number is larger than the estimate of atoms in the universe,

3075
02:53:53.450 --> 02:53:56.150
Jesus Christ.
So you can store more bits of information.

3076
02:53:56.180 --> 02:53:58.460
Then there are bits of information,

3077
02:53:59.810 --> 02:54:02.210
Denton saying we should end with that.

3078
02:54:02.480 --> 02:54:06.680
<v 2>Perfect.
It's the ultimate mind.
Fuck Ladies and gentlemen.
Wow.
You're welcome.</v>

3079
02:54:06.740 --> 02:54:09.470
Thank you very much man.
It's been so amazing.
Amazing conversation.

3080
02:54:10.010 --> 02:54:13.100
Really fascinating.
Um,
your stuff that people,
if you're interested,

3081
02:54:13.101 --> 02:54:17.030
it's called true brain.
This is the,
a nootropic blended,
the three different ones.

3082
02:54:17.380 --> 02:54:19.220
Uh,
I tried,
they're the one with caffeine,

3083
02:54:19.221 --> 02:54:22.570
which you said taste the least good and it was pretty good.
Um,

3084
02:54:22.730 --> 02:54:27.710
and your center is called alternatives as brain institute.
We can get,

3085
02:54:27.770 --> 02:54:31.850
you can ask this to both the websites@alternativesbh.com which is behavioral

3086
02:54:31.851 --> 02:54:36.680
health and then true brain tru,
brain.com.
Really,
really fascinating.

3087
02:54:36.710 --> 02:54:38.530
Thank you very much.
Really appreciate you coming on.

3088
02:54:38.890 --> 02:54:39.920
Alright Ladies and gentlemen,

3089
02:54:40.190 --> 02:54:42.920
we'll be back in a couple of hours with Duncan Trussell.

3090
02:54:42.950 --> 02:54:44.840
So while we'll see them much love.
Bye.
Bye.

3091
02:54:47.550 --> 02:54:47.800
<v 1>Cool.</v>
