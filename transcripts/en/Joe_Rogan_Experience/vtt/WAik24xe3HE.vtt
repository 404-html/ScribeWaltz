WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.830
Three four,
three,
two,
one.

2
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.350
Yeah.
And we're live gentlemen.
What's up?
What's going on again?
What's happening?

3
00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.840
Happy to be here man.
Happy to have you here man.
Thanks.

4
00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.160
You are the only guy right now that I know of that is fighting at the highest

5
00:00:17.161 --> 00:00:22.050
level in three combat sports.
Correct?
MMA,
Moy,

6
00:00:22.051 --> 00:00:25.650
Thai and kickboxing.
That's fucking crazy.
Thanks man.

7
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.840
Keep your head together.
I Dunno.
Like last time warming up in Rome,

8
00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.010
actually it was the first time like warming up for a kickbox.

9
00:00:32.011 --> 00:00:35.990
If I threw a spinning back,
I was it,
I'd better not do that shit.
Back.
Elbows,

10
00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.900
window and to kickbox.
You can do a spinning back fist though,
right?
Did,

11
00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.420
which I learned it.
Two of them in my last five.
Do you see the,

12
00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.600
what's happening lately where a lot of guys are hitting foreheads with their

13
00:00:45.601 --> 00:00:50.280
arms snapping their arm page?
Did it?
Um,
uh,
obviously,
uh,

14
00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:54.270
who else did it recently?
Paul Felder did it.
A couple of guys have done it.

15
00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:59.100
They spin and you,
you catch foreheads and that is not a good combination,
I feel.

16
00:00:59.101 --> 00:01:02.740
I feel like the kickboxing glove protects you a little bit more than that.

17
00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.750
Probably does four ounce,
10 ounce.
There's a,

18
00:01:06.751 --> 00:01:09.980
there's a little bit of cushion there that might protect you a little more.
Yeah,

19
00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:12.780
it's still,
I don't know,
it's still something that,

20
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.660
you know when they first started fighting kickboxing he was like,

21
00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.480
I don't know him and like be careful with it because I would like kind of catch

22
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.340
like the middle of my arm.
You know,
it's a little,

23
00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.270
it's a little different than the spinning elbow,
which is in my opinion,

24
00:01:24.271 --> 00:01:25.950
a lot more safer it to throw.

25
00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:30.150
Now what happens if you throw a spinning back fist and kickboxing and you really

26
00:01:30.151 --> 00:01:33.420
kind of catch them with like the meat above the elbow.
It's illegal.

27
00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:37.590
It's legal or illegal.
You're only about here.
No,

28
00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.650
you have to in based on in whether its glory or it's k one or it's a Bella tour.

29
00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.490
It has to be with the back knuckle back of the pad of that love.

30
00:01:49.501 --> 00:01:52.380
You can't be the side and that'll be the hammer fist.
That is illegal.

31
00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:54.630
That's weird.
You'll get a point deduct it.

32
00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.130
And if you cause more damage than the f you might go DQ.

33
00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.910
Get the cute,
yeah.
When Sato knocked out Joe and that Bella tour fight,

34
00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:03.750
if you watch it,

35
00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.110
it was a hammer fist and there was a lot of talk about whether it was legal or

36
00:02:07.111 --> 00:02:10.320
illegal,
but it wasn't a back fist.
It was a hammer fist.
Hmm.
Yeah.

37
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.180
It's not interesting.
Yeah.
It's illegal per Iska and most governing bodies.

38
00:02:15.181 --> 00:02:18.940
So when Joe Schilling in that kickboxing fight,
when they first saw,

39
00:02:18.941 --> 00:02:23.850
because they spun it because he landed with the back of the hand or the side of

40
00:02:23.851 --> 00:02:26.070
the hand,
it's actually illegal.
It's considered a foul.
Yeah.

41
00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.460
Did anybody bring it up?
They mentioned it,

42
00:02:29.461 --> 00:02:33.750
but I think at that time Joe had come off of that Simon situation with lion

43
00:02:33.751 --> 00:02:37.920
fight and he was like,
ah,
move on.
You know?
Right.
You know,
I got knocked out.

44
00:02:37.921 --> 00:02:39.930
It is what it is,
you know?
So he didn't make a big deal about it.

45
00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.450
That dude his fucking hard.
Yeah,
absolutely.
Yeah.
And Joe,

46
00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:47.910
so reckless,
he's so aggressive.
You know,
like he,

47
00:02:47.911 --> 00:02:52.620
he has these moments of like extreme emotion where he's just,
and that dude,

48
00:02:52.621 --> 00:02:56.310
he wanted to knock that dude out so bad after he got knocked out in the MMA

49
00:02:56.311 --> 00:03:00.010
fight.
He wanted to knock him out in his rules.

50
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.410
<v 1>And I think that I think is what you saw with Cody this weekend.</v>

51
00:03:02.411 --> 00:03:05.800
Too much emotion.
One fight.
Yeah man.

52
00:03:05.801 --> 00:03:08.350
We were talking about that and watching the replays,

53
00:03:08.351 --> 00:03:12.550
like you could see in his face that every shot he was trying to knock them out

54
00:03:12.551 --> 00:03:14.800
with.
As soon as I saw him walk,
I mean not walk out.

55
00:03:14.801 --> 00:03:18.880
I said he looked like a walking out as soon as the bell rung.
I was like,

56
00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.080
he just did it.
He looked a little stiff.
Yeah.
You know,

57
00:03:23.081 --> 00:03:26.590
and I was hoping he would shake it off,
get in the rhythm,
like land,

58
00:03:26.591 --> 00:03:28.840
a couple jabs,
just like,
you know,
we were working on,

59
00:03:28.841 --> 00:03:32.740
when I spar with them a couple of times leading up to the TJ fight,

60
00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.440
I'll go up to Alpha male to do my wrestling.
And a lot of my grappling,
um,

61
00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.941
you know,

62
00:03:36.941 --> 00:03:41.941
they have so many hundred 3,545 pounders up there that only an hour and half

63
00:03:42.221 --> 00:03:46.780
away drive.
Right.
It only makes sense to go up there and exchange knowledge.

64
00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:51.070
So you know,
as soon as I saw him walk out and started the fight,
I was like,

65
00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.360
I hope she just,
he just shakes it off and like gets into his,
his groove.

66
00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.970
Like when he fought dom,
that was artwork that was,
that was incredible.

67
00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:02.410
He just let him come to him and I was hoping that was what was his game plan,

68
00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:05.770
knock his fucking ass out.

69
00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.700
He wanted to use more wrestling from what a,

70
00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:11.590
we were talking to Danny and all those guys about it.

71
00:04:11.591 --> 00:04:14.360
He wanted to use more wrestling and definitely a lot of kicks.
Yeah.
He,

72
00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:16.360
he wanted to kick up a little bit as well,

73
00:04:16.361 --> 00:04:20.860
but he also wanted to just do the same thing to what he did to dom.
You know,

74
00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.620
just kind of like peace them up.
And I mean considering the last fight,

75
00:04:23.621 --> 00:04:26.770
he almost finish him in the first round.
Right.
When they first fought,

76
00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.200
he was like,
I can,
I can do this,
I can finish this guy.

77
00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:33.140
I think he could finish anybody.
Yeah.
But it's,

78
00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.200
he's got to go about it the right way.

79
00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:39.030
And I thought he was going about it the right way initially with the kicks.

80
00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.340
And I was like,
look,
even if these are just landing on the arms,

81
00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.770
like these are going to soften TJ up.
The other brutal,

82
00:04:44.771 --> 00:04:48.070
he was throwing some brutal kicks it and it was a totally different thing.

83
00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.520
He was a,

84
00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.060
he was adding a whole different aspect to the fight and he did in the first part

85
00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:56.130
and it,
it wasn't,
uh,
it,
it,
it,
it,
it,

86
00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.070
when he started throwing the kicks,
I was like,
yeah,
there's the game plan.

87
00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:01.930
I see what I see what's going on.
Beautiful.

88
00:05:01.931 --> 00:05:03.910
And then when he pointed to the ground and he was like,
yes,

89
00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:06.100
you couldn't touch me.
I'm like,
oh,
he's starting to get in this rhythm.

90
00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:10.630
But that's what I hate about immediate rematches after knock out.
It's just,

91
00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:15.490
it's still in your head.
It's just the confidence level,
the anger,

92
00:05:15.491 --> 00:05:19.060
the emotion.
Like,
you know,
Henry two,

93
00:05:19.061 --> 00:05:22.720
three years between his fight with Dj,
where he got finished in the first round,

94
00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:26.380
right.
More fights,
fighting some other people.
Uh,
he was a different human.

95
00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:30.460
Absolutely.
But if he had fought DJ the very next fight,

96
00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:34.210
who knows how that goes,
right?
It was,

97
00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:36.790
that would be hard to sell less.

98
00:05:36.791 --> 00:05:39.250
Henry was the champion and Dj took the crown from him.

99
00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:41.890
This was the whole idea was that,
you know,

100
00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:46.920
Cody had beat dom Cody was the champ and that Cody was defending the honor of

101
00:05:47.801 --> 00:05:52.150
Alpha male and Tj was this snake in the grass they were going to put away.

102
00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:56.140
That was the whole idea behind the ultimate fighter.
And there was just so,

103
00:05:56.410 --> 00:06:00.260
I don't think there's ever been a fight other than maybe Ronda and Miesha that

104
00:06:00.261 --> 00:06:02.890
had more emotion,
just more,
you know,

105
00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:07.080
bad blood by the Rondon Ameesha thing might've been worse.
It's,

106
00:06:07.081 --> 00:06:10.200
people don't remember how hated Rhonda was after that Meesha fight,

107
00:06:10.201 --> 00:06:12.440
cause she wouldn't shake me.
She's hand like me.

108
00:06:12.441 --> 00:06:15.140
She tried to shake your hand and Ron was like,
bitch could,

109
00:06:15.141 --> 00:06:18.020
I didn't just walk away.
And everybody's like,
whoa.

110
00:06:18.021 --> 00:06:21.210
And like why was interviewing her?
It was just a blue,

111
00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:25.490
like the whole audience was booing those emotional fights.

112
00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:28.130
They're so compelling to watch,
but man,

113
00:06:28.131 --> 00:06:31.130
they're so fraught with peril for the fighters.
Absolutely.

114
00:06:31.131 --> 00:06:35.450
If you look at his face,
his kid has 50 fights.
Yes.
50 fights.

115
00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:39.410
Amateur Muay Thai,
MMA,
kickboxing back to a junior.

116
00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:43.490
The only scars you're going to see on his face are from a fight where he fought

117
00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:47.690
Damien early,
whose brother had that was in line fight.
That was a lion fight.

118
00:06:47.691 --> 00:06:51.830
I saw that fight.
Yeah,
I was very angry.
He was very,
he wanted to put him away.

119
00:06:51.831 --> 00:06:55.710
I dropped him twice once because it,

120
00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:00.620
Gaston was a rising star in line fight at the time and the family,

121
00:07:00.621 --> 00:07:03.350
they're the earliest,
the Chasse Danes,
and everything's cool now,

122
00:07:03.351 --> 00:07:07.760
but at the time the parents were very aggressive online towards guest on.

123
00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:11.000
They were like,
well,
he parents where they won't fight,

124
00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:16.430
he won't fight our boy.
Well,
one,
you're not even in his weight class,
you know,

125
00:07:16.431 --> 00:07:18.470
and then you know,
they said,
oh,
we can make the wait.
So,
okay,

126
00:07:18.471 --> 00:07:19.790
if you make the weight will take the fight.

127
00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:22.820
And they made the way they made the weight.
But it was the one,

128
00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:27.140
and I've said it sense does anything to Eddie and Eddie who?

129
00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:31.010
Eddie episode,
my one of my teammates,
we've been trained together for what,

130
00:07:31.011 --> 00:07:33.620
like five years now?
Yeah.
And what was the problem with them?

131
00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:37.400
They fought Damien and Eddie fought her 155 pounds,

132
00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:39.770
which is what Eddie and they both fight it that way.

133
00:07:39.771 --> 00:07:41.390
Then he wants to come down to fight me.

134
00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:45.920
But Eddie landed in legal elbow in the back of the neck.
It wasn't,

135
00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:49.670
it didn't seem like it was that hard,
but it ended the fight.

136
00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:53.960
And Eddie got the cute and then they're just talking mad shit saying,
Oh,

137
00:07:53.961 --> 00:07:58.080
you know,
you want it.
You did that on purpose.
And like Eddie,
if you meet Eddie,

138
00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:02.510
you'd be like,
he's the coolest guy ever.
He's a smooth,
silky,
smooth,

139
00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:07.880
silky,
smooth,
amazing.
It seems so chill in there and it just,

140
00:08:07.881 --> 00:08:12.881
just really knows how to pace himself and it just extend his energy perfectly.

141
00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:16.820
I mean,
really interesting fighter to watch.
He's,

142
00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:21.380
he's my favorite people to work with.
Like trains.
Yeah.

143
00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:23.600
Yeah.
He's,
he's,
he's,
he's such,
uh,

144
00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:26.480
any such an amazing who would be now and in the best part is,

145
00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:31.800
is that guest on hated it.
I hated it.
Hated it.
I hated it.

146
00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:38.000
Was this pre pre Braids Eddie?
Uh,
yeah.

147
00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:41.870
And so growing up as an amateur Eddie,
Eddie started what,

148
00:08:41.871 --> 00:08:45.020
like two years after that?
About two years after I did.
And you know,

149
00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:48.140
I always like shake his hand and stuff like that when I saw him,
but we,

150
00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:52.700
they camp that he was from his coach,
hated me.
Did not like me at all.

151
00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:55.320
Yeah.
And uh,

152
00:08:55.350 --> 00:09:00.350
so Gaston was fighting in San Francisco and it was the first time the gas don't

153
00:09:00.361 --> 00:09:03.330
ever got knocked out and he got knocked out and he was supposed to,
you know,

154
00:09:03.331 --> 00:09:07.530
there's,
and Gaston at the time,
locally in the bay area,
he was the guy,
you know,

155
00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:12.270
the amateur kid,
he's a star.
Everybody loves him.
Years old,
beating everybody,

156
00:09:12.271 --> 00:09:15.480
fighting.
Anybody,
anybody in any way class from,
you know,
one 30,

157
00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:19.640
one 37 to one form 50.
I'll fight anybody.
I didn't care.

158
00:09:19.641 --> 00:09:22.500
I was just trying to get the experience the first two years of,

159
00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:27.240
of my junior career and not so much the first year I fought as a junior,

160
00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:31.230
I beat pretty much every,
everybody my age and back then the rules were like,

161
00:09:31.231 --> 00:09:35.520
if you're under 16 you can't,
if you're under 18 you're a junior here.

162
00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:39.540
Get me in trouble man.
So we,
we just fake my,

163
00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:43.890
my birth and my dad had my birth certificate often.
Yeah.

164
00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:49.010
So it was April 18 two years before that I was 18 I haven't find adults early.

165
00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:53.440
People do that.
That's dope.
Nobody would fight him.
He couldn't find him.

166
00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:57.990
He knew what he was doing that or he'd beat everybody junior.
So we said,
okay.

167
00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:01.800
So we made an 18 and he fought and he got and he got knocked out.

168
00:10:01.801 --> 00:10:04.290
Just he cut too much weight for a fight in it.
You know,
you go as you,

169
00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:06.240
as you learned,
he cut down to 37 and,

170
00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:08.310
and it was a little to walk around with weight.

171
00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:10.410
Well the thing is I was planning on fighting.

172
00:10:10.411 --> 00:10:14.910
So what was the camp that were fine?
My issue,
my issue.
So we're fighting,

173
00:10:14.911 --> 00:10:18.000
we're supposed to fight at one 42 which I was fine with and at the time I

174
00:10:18.001 --> 00:10:21.060
probably could've made one,
one 35 but the week of is like,
Hey,

175
00:10:21.061 --> 00:10:25.020
your opponent dropped out,
his teammate will fight you the whole fight.

176
00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:28.410
You one 37.
Oh yeah.
And you know,

177
00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:32.100
going from extra pounds is a lot,
but going from one 40.
Yeah,
exactly.

178
00:10:32.101 --> 00:10:36.300
I was like walking on one 49 going like another 12 pounds at that age.

179
00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:39.720
I was like 18 I wasn't,
I didn't do it right.
I was just like,

180
00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:44.250
it just didn't work out for me.
So he got caught and uh,
I was winning the fight.

181
00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:48.000
Absolutely.
It's one of the fight destroying.
I mean,
and again,
this guy,

182
00:10:48.001 --> 00:10:50.630
I think he works at Walmart now.
Now that's not a bullshit.

183
00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:54.720
This is great kid power right hand cause respect to Walmart,
no disrespect.

184
00:10:55.290 --> 00:10:57.850
But he got caught and in between rounds I could see it.

185
00:10:57.851 --> 00:11:01.190
It was like a deer in headlight.
He just guessed on was on autopilot.

186
00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:03.480
He was winning,
but he wasn't there.
So he gets caught.

187
00:11:03.481 --> 00:11:08.481
He gets dropped and literally Eddie's camp was just swarmed the ring screaming

188
00:11:10.171 --> 00:11:12.390
and yelling guest ons out.

189
00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:17.660
And I remember clearly seeing Eddie and that guy coronary like you know,

190
00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:21.500
just like,
yeah and like he was just part of the camp doing what everybody,

191
00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:26.220
all his friends were doing.
And since then I was like,
oh,
I hate that.

192
00:11:26.221 --> 00:11:30.300
We all,
we all,
we all hated the camp.
We all hated Eddie.

193
00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:33.570
And then one of one of our team,
my teammates fought Eddie,

194
00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:38.790
same thing but cut.
He thought a Brooks Brooks cut them right on top of the head.

195
00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:43.470
Brooks,
he had to have a staples and everything and same thing.

196
00:11:43.471 --> 00:11:45.870
They were just like treating us like they were the shit.
And I was like,

197
00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:50.970
fuck these guys man.
Emotions involved in camps.
I mean it's,

198
00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:53.980
it's such a wasted thing.
It doesn't,

199
00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:57.940
<v 2>it's definitely bad for the fighters because it creates this added element.</v>

200
00:11:57.941 --> 00:12:00.550
Like fighting is hard enough as it is.

201
00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:02.680
But when you add all this hate and disdain,

202
00:12:02.681 --> 00:12:06.130
the only thing he could potentially do is if you don't have a good work ethic,

203
00:12:06.131 --> 00:12:10.300
which obviously you do,
it'll get you up
some.

204
00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:15.400
Do you remember when Buster Douglas fought Mike Tyson when buster Douglas was a

205
00:12:15.401 --> 00:12:18.730
42 to one underdog,
but everybody knew buster had talent,

206
00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:23.260
but he was like a lazy guy.
Then his mom died and when his mom died,

207
00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:28.120
he just made a decision.
He was like,
fuck this,
you know,
he was hurting.

208
00:12:28.121 --> 00:12:29.620
He was in pain and he's like,

209
00:12:29.621 --> 00:12:32.560
I'm going to train like a wild animal for this fight.

210
00:12:32.770 --> 00:12:34.690
I'm going to train like I've never trained before.
I'm going to,

211
00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:36.340
I'm going to train like a real world champion,

212
00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:40.210
and he came out there Jabin and Hook it off the jab and everybody's like,

213
00:12:40.211 --> 00:12:44.770
what the fuck is going on with the combination that he knocked Tyson out with

214
00:12:44.771 --> 00:12:48.580
was like,
Holy Shit.
Well,
only achieved those heights again.

215
00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:51.520
Only fight I've ever bet on my entire life was that fight.

216
00:12:51.521 --> 00:12:52.730
You bet on ties in Asia,

217
00:12:54.910 --> 00:12:57.160
but 500 to win 50 bucks,

218
00:12:58.830 --> 00:13:03.580
it's 50 free dollars.
Crazy emotions are never good.
I mean,

219
00:13:03.581 --> 00:13:07.630
that's like a rare time where emotions work good because it got a lazy guy to

220
00:13:07.631 --> 00:13:10.050
the gym to train like a real professional.
Yep.

221
00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:12.380
<v 1>And the thing with Eddie is that without question,</v>

222
00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:15.500
Eddie is the glue that holds our team together.

223
00:13:15.650 --> 00:13:19.580
Here's the best thing that ever happened to our gym because he's crazy.
His Ego,

224
00:13:19.610 --> 00:13:23.660
he doesn't like,
his ego is just like not he's,
he'll just do whatever.
He's like,

225
00:13:23.661 --> 00:13:25.560
Hey,
you want to work?
You want to do this?
What do you,
what?

226
00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:30.260
What do you want to do?
He's not,
there's no like we're both Alpha males and CSA,

227
00:13:30.261 --> 00:13:32.990
you know,
like,
yeah,
well he's like,
Hey,
what do you want to do man?

228
00:13:32.991 --> 00:13:35.540
You want to run?
You want to work?
Those are the guys that grow,
man.

229
00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:40.570
The guys that grow are the guys to help just chill out and help our team girls

230
00:13:40.581 --> 00:13:44.660
so much.
When Eddie came to me,
he basically like we literally,

231
00:13:44.930 --> 00:13:48.200
same thing happened with a guest on is that because Gaston was a little prick

232
00:13:48.201 --> 00:13:52.040
when I met him too.
But Eddie,
he,
and he'll admit it.
He was like,
you know,

233
00:13:52.041 --> 00:13:53.450
he was just around the wrong people.

234
00:13:53.690 --> 00:13:57.260
I watched him fight and his last amateur fight and I hated him and I was rooting

235
00:13:57.261 --> 00:14:01.210
for him to lose.
I was literally sitting in the back being a hater going,
oh,

236
00:14:01.211 --> 00:14:03.590
this is awesome.
And he started losing a fight.

237
00:14:03.591 --> 00:14:06.830
He blew his knee out and he started losing.
And while the fight was happening,

238
00:14:06.890 --> 00:14:09.170
I started rooting for him and I hated him.

239
00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:13.400
But his heart and his spirit was the first I ever saw one of those towns kids

240
00:14:13.401 --> 00:14:17.030
ever saw.
I blew his knee out,
blew his ACL,
kept fighting through the whole fight.

241
00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:21.320
It was one most impressive performance I've ever seen.
After the fight,

242
00:14:21.321 --> 00:14:23.750
I went back into the locker room.
He was by himself crying.

243
00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:27.370
His coach wasn't there.
He has a team left cause he,
he,
you know,

244
00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:31.370
he was undefeated champion,
world champion,
amateur world champion.

245
00:14:31.371 --> 00:14:35.300
Like he had racked up a ton of fights and you know,
the team,

246
00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:37.070
his team was behind him because he was winning.

247
00:14:37.071 --> 00:14:41.350
But then he loses against the guy that he had beat him before.
Yup.

248
00:14:41.630 --> 00:14:44.300
And then his team was gone and I went back and I told him,
I said,
listen,
I said,

249
00:14:44.301 --> 00:14:46.910
this probably doesn't mean much to you.
I said,

250
00:14:46.911 --> 00:14:50.120
but I want to tell you that I am more impressed with you and losing this fight

251
00:14:50.121 --> 00:14:52.210
and what I saw from you than in any

252
00:14:52.210 --> 00:14:55.340
<v 3>time else that you showboated you won.
You destroy people,</v>

253
00:14:55.341 --> 00:14:56.510
the heart you displayed.

254
00:14:56.780 --> 00:15:00.230
You are one of the best fighters I've ever seen in my life.

255
00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:04.910
Three months later he hit me up,
brought ice cream,
came to CSA and he said,
hey,

256
00:15:04.911 --> 00:15:07.920
can I train here?
Brought ice cream,
brought ice cream.
I saw,

257
00:15:08.010 --> 00:15:10.250
I saw him walked in with his fucking answering.
I was like,

258
00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.900
what is going on right now?
Guests die.
Is he here guest Don King?

259
00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:19.310
No you did.
No.
And he said,
Eddie trains here.

260
00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:22.670
I'm leaving because I'm gone.
How long did it take you to warm up to him?

261
00:15:24.410 --> 00:15:28.910
<v 4>We spar ones and you know,
Karen had a real talk with me.
He's like,
listen man,</v>

262
00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.640
I'm,
you know,
I'm the head coach here and like,
um,
um,
your,

263
00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:37.480
your dad like relax,
I know what I'm doing.
When have I failed you?
You know,

264
00:15:37.490 --> 00:15:38.660
I'm telling you this,
you know,

265
00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:43.740
<v 3>if he,
if he's,
if he's who he,
we think he is or we thought he was,</v>

266
00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:46.440
you know,
like I'll,
I'll know you'll leave,

267
00:15:46.650 --> 00:15:50.280
but you got to give them the opportunity and when he saying that he's telling

268
00:15:50.281 --> 00:15:53.070
the truth,
I was his legal guardian at the time when he threatened to leave.

269
00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:54.450
The first question on my mouth was,

270
00:15:54.630 --> 00:15:56.600
are you going to leave the gym or are you going to leave my house?

271
00:15:56.750 --> 00:16:00.180
But you live there too.
So he was living with me.
I said,

272
00:16:00.181 --> 00:16:03.300
so it's gotta be weird if you're training somewhere else.
How old were you then?

273
00:16:03.830 --> 00:16:06.920
15 I became a no,
Guardian went when it came,

274
00:16:06.930 --> 00:16:11.820
I was maybe 18.
Nobody?
No,
yeah.

275
00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:12.541
Became his,

276
00:16:12.541 --> 00:16:15.810
his parents moved back to Peru and I became his legal guardian so he could

277
00:16:15.811 --> 00:16:18.660
finish school here in the u s and he came to live with me and I put them,

278
00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:22.350
put them into college and all that.
Yeah.
Year before that.

279
00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:24.300
That's a tight relationship.
A year before that

280
00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:29.400
<v 4>commuting.
So I had,
I was trying to affair tax mountain view,
uh,</v>

281
00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:34.500
at the time and I was coaching there and he was coaching there every couple of

282
00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:35.590
days.
And then,
you know,
we,

283
00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:40.470
2008 happened South Korea if ma,
uh,

284
00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:45.270
he was the coach for the US National Moitai team and you know,
we just,

285
00:16:45.510 --> 00:16:47.880
we just clicked.
We were just like,
you know,
he w

286
00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:52.140
<v 3>when I,
when I met him at,
at Fairtex,
I was teaching,
I was hitting a heavy bag.</v>

287
00:16:52.141 --> 00:16:54.930
He came walking up to me,
he was like,
he's 14,
15,

288
00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:58.860
he's got his picture on the front window at Fairtex mountain view.
So He's,

289
00:16:58.890 --> 00:16:59.940
you know,
cause he's a good looking kid.

290
00:16:59.941 --> 00:17:03.740
He was a surfer and modeling and all that.
So he walks up and he rolls up.

291
00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:08.130
He rolls up his shorts next to me.
He goes,
who are you man?
And I'm like,
I'm like,

292
00:17:08.131 --> 00:17:11.280
Oh,
I'm carrying him.
He goes,
okay.
He goes,
what do you do here?
I was like,
I teach.

293
00:17:11.310 --> 00:17:14.100
He goes,
I never see you here before Johnson ons,
my coach,

294
00:17:14.330 --> 00:17:17.880
he starts kicking the bag,
kicking the back.
I'm like,
oh,
okay,
cool.
All right,

295
00:17:17.910 --> 00:17:18.743
good to know.

296
00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:23.460
So then Johnson on couldn't coach the national team in 2008 and Korea.

297
00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:26.670
So as a fair tax coach,
they asked me if I wanted to go.
I said,
yeah.

298
00:17:26.671 --> 00:17:30.300
So I get onto the plane on my way to Korea for the world championships and I see

299
00:17:30.301 --> 00:17:32.880
this thing connection and they can action that.
The connection,
the connection.

300
00:17:32.881 --> 00:17:37.320
I was like,
and I see here and I see this and I see this little fuck it.
I'm like,

301
00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:40.530
Oh God,
I hate this kid and I couldn't stand him.

302
00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:44.430
And so we get there and I'm like,
he's going to get murdered and I'm happy.

303
00:17:44.431 --> 00:17:46.080
I'm glad he's going to go,
but he's going to learn a lesson.

304
00:17:46.090 --> 00:17:47.830
He's a valuable lesson.
I didn't cut.
Yeah at the

305
00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:50.070
<v 4>time and I've,
I</v>

306
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:54.030
<v 1>was fighting the returner returning two time gold medalist that if my on my</v>

307
00:17:54.031 --> 00:17:56.640
first ever,
that was my first grown ass man,

308
00:17:56.641 --> 00:18:00.630
his when he made his amateur debut at the world championships against the

309
00:18:00.631 --> 00:18:03.690
returning champion who was like,
it was Becca.

310
00:18:03.691 --> 00:18:08.190
Stan was a of standing kid like really,
really good.
Probably 80 fights.

311
00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:13.580
He was 17 he was 17 about to make the jump into a class the next year.

312
00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:15.750
So I'm literally,

313
00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:19.770
I'm writing out his parent's name and phone number so I can call them after this

314
00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.440
children's,
your amateur debut?
Pretty much,
yeah.
Amateur debut.

315
00:18:23.441 --> 00:18:26.790
I was against an amateur world champion at the world championships.

316
00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:30.940
He was finance.
Yes it was.
It was crazy.
It was the,
I didn't up,

317
00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:34.800
I didn't even know.
I didn't even know cause I was just going through,
I was like,

318
00:18:34.810 --> 00:18:37.020
I'm just going to my,
and my mind,

319
00:18:37.021 --> 00:18:39.870
I was going to go in there and fuck this kid up even though he was way taller

320
00:18:39.871 --> 00:18:42.870
than me and like I wasn't cutting away at the time.
These,
these guys cut weight,

321
00:18:43.050 --> 00:18:46.140
they take,
you know,
all those countries that eastern bloc,

322
00:18:46.410 --> 00:18:48.780
they take it very seriously because if you get a gold medal there,

323
00:18:48.781 --> 00:18:52.920
you're pretty much set for life.
Yeah.
More types.
Huge internationally.

324
00:18:52.921 --> 00:18:56.430
Most people don't understand it at that time.
2008,
2009,

325
00:18:56.431 --> 00:18:59.700
it's kind of the dark era of International Moyie Thai here in America.

326
00:18:59.701 --> 00:19:02.580
The United States,
we tie federation,
which is kind of like the Olympic,

327
00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:05.040
the US Olympic Committee,
cause it's not an Olympic sport yet.

328
00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:09.150
It was literally who can afford to go.
There was no government funding.

329
00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:10.410
There's no uh,

330
00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:15.010
there was no selection process and literally we had a team of six people.
Yeah,

331
00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:19.980
right.
Thailand's got 40.
Russia's got 50 people.
We went,
there were six people.

332
00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:24.420
Um,
and uh,
Anthony Lin,
who was the president of the fair tax USA,

333
00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:29.430
was the founder of USM.
F He was the poster boy at Fairtex just as a kid.

334
00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:30.720
And he didn't really,
he didn't have any fight shit.

335
00:19:30.721 --> 00:19:32.400
He's just a good looking kid that kicked really well.

336
00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:34.590
So that will take them over there and be good experience for them.

337
00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:38.220
The whole time I'm like,
this kid is going to get fucking murder.
No Way.
I mean,

338
00:19:38.221 --> 00:19:42.120
I had no idea what I was walking into.
I had a few smokers,
I had to go.

339
00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:47.010
He goes out.
I wanted him to tell him,
don't go ahead though.
I go out there,

340
00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:50.490
I just like get hit.
And I was like,
Holy Shit,
this guy hits like a man.

341
00:19:51.910 --> 00:19:54.900
It's really hard.
But I was just,
I just didn't care.

342
00:19:54.901 --> 00:19:58.740
I just went in there and they gave it all I had.
I really did.

343
00:19:58.741 --> 00:20:02.640
And I was really disappointed in my performance because I really truly believed

344
00:20:02.641 --> 00:20:06.960
I was going to win the fight.
I went in there to win even though I had no,
not,

345
00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:11.370
not much experience.
I didn't have 80,
80 fights as he did.
I had zero.

346
00:20:11.371 --> 00:20:13.470
I had maybe a couple of smokers,
uh,

347
00:20:13.690 --> 00:20:17.250
two amateur fights when I was like 12 and 13 but that's about it.

348
00:20:17.251 --> 00:20:19.050
And one boxing fight.
But that was it.

349
00:20:19.051 --> 00:20:23.160
This guy had 80 and a lot of them were probably professional fights.

350
00:20:23.850 --> 00:20:27.290
Absolutely.
There's no such thing as amateur in white tie.

351
00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:30.900
And in Europe like I mean,
yeah they consider it like B class,

352
00:20:30.901 --> 00:20:32.540
but they still fight without shinguards.

353
00:20:32.670 --> 00:20:35.180
They still do all this and like when they go in there,
they,

354
00:20:35.181 --> 00:20:38.580
they're going in there to win and I thought,
I mean I lost,

355
00:20:38.581 --> 00:20:42.950
I knew I had lost the fight but I lost a split decision.
It was crazy.

356
00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:46.230
Crazy.
It's to go in there and like,

357
00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:51.640
I mean I knew something was up when I saw my matchup was like an ounce and this

358
00:20:51.641 --> 00:20:54.880
guys,
he didn't have his full name.
They also,
they only had his first name.

359
00:20:56.050 --> 00:20:58.270
I was like,
they know this guy.
I was say didn't,

360
00:20:58.770 --> 00:21:01.900
it was a guest on the line is against what was the oil back or something like

361
00:21:01.901 --> 00:21:03.760
that.
And so whatever happened to him,

362
00:21:06.730 --> 00:21:10.570
I think we saw him the next year.
The next year he went into like a doll class.

363
00:21:10.571 --> 00:21:10.990
But it was like,

364
00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:14.330
so there's [inaudible] and there's a class eight classes where most of the pros

365
00:21:14.331 --> 00:21:17.500
go,
right.
He went straight into a class after fighting me.

366
00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:21.760
His coach beat the shit out of him after losing a through witness split decision

367
00:21:21.761 --> 00:21:22.594
against me,

368
00:21:22.830 --> 00:21:27.830
just beat him distraught in front of us and the light cause he heard because he

369
00:21:28.481 --> 00:21:32.140
heard I was,
that was only like my third fight or like my amateur debut.

370
00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:36.500
He was like,
you know Americans were in really beat him in front of you.
Yeah.

371
00:21:36.510 --> 00:21:39.160
Also beat,
just slap the shit out of him.

372
00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:42.970
Like one of the worst things I've ever seen.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's very,

373
00:21:42.971 --> 00:21:47.650
very different over there and in the fight the crowd got behind guest on because

374
00:21:47.651 --> 00:21:51.010
he was doing very dynamic things.
He was,
and that was really small too.

375
00:21:51.011 --> 00:21:52.980
I was only like,
what,
five,
five,
five,
four.

376
00:21:52.981 --> 00:21:57.910
At the time this guy was like five 11 and in between rounds my light switch went

377
00:21:57.911 --> 00:22:00.340
off with him because literally I go in between rounds and I go,

378
00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:04.780
I go look over there.
I said,
look,
I said,
this is the the previous world champion.

379
00:22:04.781 --> 00:22:08.050
I said,
you are going toe to toe with him.
I said,
you,
he is tired.

380
00:22:08.051 --> 00:22:10.510
And he looks up at me.
He goes,
you guys not goes.
I'm not tired.

381
00:22:10.570 --> 00:22:14.260
Americans don't get tired.
I'm like,
well number one,
calm down.
You're Peruvian.

382
00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:17.830
Okay.
Take it easy.
Uh,
number two,
you're the cutest thing ever.

383
00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:21.100
I love you to death.
Uh,
and from that moment on,

384
00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:26.340
this kid has literally been my son and what sealed it for me is while we were

385
00:22:27.071 --> 00:22:31.870
backstage,
this kid was getting beat within an inch of his life by his coach,

386
00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:33.910
guest on takes off his jersey,

387
00:22:34.090 --> 00:22:37.540
walks over and interrupts the beating and gives his Jersey because that's kind

388
00:22:37.541 --> 00:22:41.360
of customary to give exchange jerseys and erupted the beading.
Yeah.

389
00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:46.270
How long is this meeting going on for?
So they walked off,
he wasn't even like,

390
00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:50.260
it's his team had kind of left them to this coach has walked him back and just

391
00:22:50.261 --> 00:22:54.220
like start slapping the shit out of him.
And then I stopped it and I was like,

392
00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:58.340
how long was he slapping him for?
Well,
like the walk back was like,
well,
like,

393
00:22:58.341 --> 00:23:03.230
like 10 minutes for 10.
Just berating them.
Yeah,

394
00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:07.330
it,
it's bad.
Everybody was like,
Oh shit.
What's going on over there?
Yeah.

395
00:23:07.331 --> 00:23:11.350
It's not the best way to motivate someone.
Definitely.
Now,
he won.
He Won.

396
00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:14.970
He won the whole tournament.
He wanted,
yeah,
he took all those hours.

397
00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:19.480
Probably his toughest fight though.
Yeah,
man.

398
00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:25.570
Yeah.
The,
uh,
the,
the crazy thing about that is this,
you know,

399
00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:27.100
in America,

400
00:23:27.250 --> 00:23:32.020
people don't even understand that Moy could be that big somewhere else.

401
00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:34.420
That it could be that important to people.
You know,

402
00:23:34.421 --> 00:23:39.340
it's more ties a mystery to me in the sense that I just don't understand why it

403
00:23:39.341 --> 00:23:43.390
never caught on.
I really don't get it.
I think it's part of,

404
00:23:43.391 --> 00:23:46.520
it's the music part of,
it's the,
the,
the ritual

405
00:23:46.550 --> 00:23:49.820
<v 3>part of it is just the way MMA blew up.
I mean,</v>

406
00:23:49.821 --> 00:23:53.310
if you look at that and go through all the why crew and everything in Europe
eat,

407
00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:58.370
if it's Moitai Yaffe is kickboxing.
No,
but if it's Moyie Thai,
yeah,

408
00:23:58.430 --> 00:24:00.540
but like he was the first.
It literally,
he would,

409
00:24:00.541 --> 00:24:04.790
he was the first junior that the u s ever sent to the world championships ever.

410
00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:07.280
He was by himself and he was the only junior ever.

411
00:24:07.610 --> 00:24:12.380
Today there are 16 juniors fighting in Thailand at the junior world

412
00:24:12.381 --> 00:24:17.000
championships.
They went eight and Oh,
today.
Yeah.
Some momentum.

413
00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:19.910
A huge momentum right now.
Literally not in the public.

414
00:24:19.930 --> 00:24:23.930
Not so it's in the fighters themselves.
Yes.
It's not publicly known,

415
00:24:23.931 --> 00:24:28.250
but right now the best junior team at the junior world championships is the

416
00:24:28.251 --> 00:24:31.830
United States.
Have you thought about that though?
Why is that?
Like why?

417
00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:36.470
How come no one can figure out a way to make it exciting or make it,

418
00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:39.170
put it on television and let people know like,
Hey,

419
00:24:39.171 --> 00:24:43.790
this is probably one of the most dynamic cotton that's definitely one of the

420
00:24:43.791 --> 00:24:47.120
most dynamic combat sports in the world next to MMA.
Um,

421
00:24:48.890 --> 00:24:51.080
a lot of it has to do with money.
It's,

422
00:24:51.170 --> 00:24:55.520
it's promoters will come in and they will be the next best thing.

423
00:24:55.521 --> 00:24:56.300
Lion fight.

424
00:24:56.300 --> 00:25:01.220
Got It right the most and then they lost the access TV deal.

425
00:25:01.970 --> 00:25:05.420
What happened with them?
Um,
for you,
if you asked line fight,

426
00:25:05.421 --> 00:25:09.820
they lost the deal because access TV wanted too much commitment.
If you ask,

427
00:25:09.821 --> 00:25:13.580
ask the STV lion,
I was canceling too many shows.
It depends on who you ask,

428
00:25:14.150 --> 00:25:17.000
but what are they on?
Like ESPN three or some shit.

429
00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:21.950
No flow elite combat is street.
Nobody knows about it.

430
00:25:21.951 --> 00:25:26.750
Like,
yeah.
Which is hard to get people to watch it on access TV.
I mean,

431
00:25:26.780 --> 00:25:30.570
access TV is a fairly fringe cable channel.
Absolutely.
Some,

432
00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:35.210
it's again,
much like MMA.
I mean,
it was the right place,
right time,
right recipe,

433
00:25:35.211 --> 00:25:38.510
ultimate fighter on the right night and great fight at the end and all of a

434
00:25:38.511 --> 00:25:40.970
sudden everybody's talking about it.
You know,
the story better than anybody.

435
00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:43.930
That hasn't happened from [inaudible] and it's,

436
00:25:43.931 --> 00:25:48.590
and it's a shame and I'd been around it now,
uh,
coached Miriam,
Kevin,
you know,

437
00:25:48.591 --> 00:25:51.590
these guys have carried more,
we tie in their shoulder for years.

438
00:25:51.591 --> 00:25:54.950
Nobody knew who it was.
How does bell tours,
kickboxing ratings do?

439
00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:58.360
It does.
Honestly.
I mean it,

440
00:25:58.490 --> 00:26:03.490
it does as well as maybe a two year old rerun of cops,

441
00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:08.420
unfortunately.
Yeah.
You know,
it does,
it does better than glory did.
Well,

442
00:26:08.421 --> 00:26:11.810
this is what,
well,
that's weird,
right?
Yeah.
Why?
Why does it do better than glory?

443
00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:15.090
Um,
I think just because a torn,
it ties to the Bella tour name.

444
00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:20.360
So Joe Schilling has decided no more kickboxing.
He's,
he's no more and more time.

445
00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:27.410
He's doing it for financial reasons and he's in his thirties I think you

446
00:26:27.411 --> 00:26:31.130
probably realize is like how many years you have left.
Five,
six years left.

447
00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:35.210
Maybe if everything goes great and nothing gets blown out,
you know,

448
00:26:35.211 --> 00:26:40.100
and he's just decided,
you know,
that's a,
that bothers me.
It me too.

449
00:26:40.101 --> 00:26:44.550
It's a labor of love for Scott Coker.
Literally.
He's convinced paramount

450
00:26:44.610 --> 00:26:47.400
<v 0>to keep it going because they believe in him.
He's doing this.</v>

451
00:26:47.401 --> 00:26:51.630
He started off with kickbox exactly because he started out with a strike strike

452
00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:56.160
force was originally kickbox and k one it does bothers me.

453
00:26:56.310 --> 00:27:00.150
I just don't,
I don't get it.
You know,
I watch,
I'm a big fan of boxing.

454
00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:03.900
I love boxing,
but it's not as fun.

455
00:27:04.930 --> 00:27:07.290
More ties,
more fun to watch.
It's more exciting.

456
00:27:07.291 --> 00:27:10.770
And I used to love watching line fight.
I was so happy when it was on.

457
00:27:10.771 --> 00:27:13.680
I have all of them recorded on my Dvr,
you know,

458
00:27:13.681 --> 00:27:18.360
and I'm now good luck trying to find Moitai on TV they had,
it's tough.

459
00:27:18.390 --> 00:27:22.470
It's tough.
I mean,
I mean,
not to toot our horn,
but I mean,

460
00:27:22.530 --> 00:27:23.800
when it comes to Moitai,

461
00:27:23.910 --> 00:27:28.910
we're the biggest gym in North America and we have the most active fighters and

462
00:27:29.190 --> 00:27:33.660
it's hard to get my people where they need to be.
There are other shows step up,

463
00:27:33.661 --> 00:27:37.200
you know,
triumphant,
uh,
is on fight pass.
That's a great show.

464
00:27:37.201 --> 00:27:40.080
Friday night fights is trying.
Lion fight is still around,
you know,

465
00:27:40.081 --> 00:27:42.930
I'll always support lion fight for,
you know,
hell,

466
00:27:42.931 --> 00:27:47.670
we help build that brand to the best as we could.
Um,
but right now,

467
00:27:47.970 --> 00:27:50.550
uh,
regionally,
Dennis Warner in,

468
00:27:50.551 --> 00:27:54.930
so cal is always going to have shows triumphant Good Friday night fights as good

469
00:27:55.230 --> 00:27:59.160
glory.
You know,
they're,
they're not really behind American talent yet.

470
00:27:59.190 --> 00:28:00.960
They're just,
they're just not.
Well,

471
00:28:00.990 --> 00:28:04.230
the problem is they do a lot of shows in Europe and these European fighters are

472
00:28:04.231 --> 00:28:07.650
extremely popular over there.
Absolutely.
I mean,
if they had their druthers,

473
00:28:07.651 --> 00:28:10.860
they would do Badr Hari every weekend.
Absolutely.
And that's what they would do.

474
00:28:11.050 --> 00:28:13.200
You know what I mean?
That guy sells out arenas.

475
00:28:13.780 --> 00:28:18.510
It's Kinda crazy scary.
Jesus Christ.

476
00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:22.210
We're just playing a video the other day,
slapping some a hotel,

477
00:28:22.211 --> 00:28:26.640
a desk person walked behind the desk and smack this guy and then

478
00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:32.940
he gets arrested for breaking a Guy Shin stomping a Guy Shin in half.

479
00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:35.750
He's so crazy.
Yeah.
Yeah.

480
00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:40.590
I mean he's like a very odd combination of a,
of lethal fighter and a thug.

481
00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:46.110
He's both for sure.
Yeah,
for sure.
And he wants you to know,
you know,

482
00:28:46.710 --> 00:28:49.680
what mood is he in today?
Which ones?
Yeah.
Well,
you know,

483
00:28:49.681 --> 00:28:54.210
he's the most compelling story right now.
And uh,
in European kickboxing.
Yeah,

484
00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:56.010
for sure.
Without question.

485
00:28:56.011 --> 00:28:59.220
They announced collusion to and they didn't even put his image up and all of a

486
00:28:59.221 --> 00:29:02.280
sudden people are excited just because of him and Rico's first.

487
00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:04.260
Are they supposed to fight again?
Is that what's going to happen?

488
00:29:04.261 --> 00:29:07.290
Rico Verhoeven in him,
I think that's the plan.
That's where they're going now.

489
00:29:07.291 --> 00:29:09.810
He broke his arm in that first fight.
Did they know how,

490
00:29:09.930 --> 00:29:12.600
was that a preexisting injury or is it just something that happened in the

491
00:29:12.601 --> 00:29:13.910
middle of a scramble?
It,

492
00:29:13.990 --> 00:29:17.970
it looked to me blocking a Kik is what it looked like to me.
And again,

493
00:29:17.971 --> 00:29:20.400
if you block a kick with the illness is not going to take that.

494
00:29:20.430 --> 00:29:23.250
It's just not done it right.
You know,
you need to reinforce the block.

495
00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:28.170
Rico is a big dude,
so he shoots you arm.
Rico's unusual too.

496
00:29:28.171 --> 00:29:29.460
And he's a big guy,

497
00:29:29.461 --> 00:29:33.930
but he fights very technically and he's got great cardio and moves really well.

498
00:29:33.990 --> 00:29:38.430
Yeah,
man.
Narratively,
well his gas tank is fantastic for a bit.

499
00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:40.360
For a big guy.
Definitely.
Yeah.

500
00:29:40.530 --> 00:29:45.040
When he got hurt bad against Jamal Benson deek and you're like,
Whoa,

501
00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:47.050
like this,
look,
this is not look good.

502
00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:51.960
Then he came back and stopped them motherfuckers.
The real deal.
Definitely.
He's,

503
00:29:51.970 --> 00:29:55.510
he's a beast.
But again,
America,
good guy could go to Walmart.

504
00:29:55.511 --> 00:29:57.940
Nobody knows who the fuck he is.
Wander around.

505
00:29:57.970 --> 00:30:00.670
It's one of the best heavyweight kickboxers of all time.

506
00:30:01.050 --> 00:30:05.320
Literally nobody knows who he is.
It's strange,
you know,
without,
without question.

507
00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:09.100
Yeah.
Yeah.
Now when you were training with Cody,
um,

508
00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:12.520
when you were over at team Alpha Male,
what does the coaching like?
Like,

509
00:30:12.521 --> 00:30:16.540
how are they,
how are they doing rounds with him?
Uh,

510
00:30:16.630 --> 00:30:19.600
while he was doing his sparring separately,
they brought us,
they brought me in,

511
00:30:19.601 --> 00:30:24.600
Eddie up just to spar with him.
Uh,
who is,
who was coaching him?
Uh,

512
00:30:24.730 --> 00:30:28.450
Danny and Danny Castillo.
Chris Holdsworth.

513
00:30:28.630 --> 00:30:31.600
So they were essentially his coaches that were coaching him.
Okay.

514
00:30:31.930 --> 00:30:34.810
And so when you were working with him,
were they saying,
hey,

515
00:30:34.811 --> 00:30:36.010
we want to really work on it?

516
00:30:36.011 --> 00:30:38.710
Certain things or would they just letting you do your thing?

517
00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:43.120
Are they asking you to I was being,
I go up there and like I said,
I go grapple.

518
00:30:44.010 --> 00:30:47.910
So I was trying to be a good giving him good luck,
skim the switches,
GIM.

519
00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:52.330
Then like that TJ shoulder move type.
Did you practice that stuff or did you not?

520
00:30:52.331 --> 00:30:52.990
I just,

521
00:30:52.990 --> 00:30:56.570
I just been one of those guys like Karen ever since I started with Koreans like,

522
00:30:56.590 --> 00:30:59.890
and I've had to help somebody like given books and it's been that guy and I've

523
00:30:59.891 --> 00:31:04.120
been good at it.
Practice t J's looks or did you just kind of know how to do it?

524
00:31:04.990 --> 00:31:08.410
I always switch regardless and like at this,

525
00:31:08.411 --> 00:31:11.290
one of my favorite things to do just offensively and defensively.

526
00:31:11.291 --> 00:31:14.230
I love switching.
Did you have a traditional martial arts background?

527
00:31:14.231 --> 00:31:16.490
Did you start out with traditional martial?
I started with white tie,

528
00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:21.160
which started with Morton.
Yeah.
Sorry about that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Some the best guys.

529
00:31:21.250 --> 00:31:21.551
You know,

530
00:31:21.551 --> 00:31:25.210
it's interesting now that the switching thing has become almost like a standard

531
00:31:25.211 --> 00:31:28.510
thing like with Tj.
Do you never know what he's doing.
You don't,

532
00:31:28.511 --> 00:31:31.570
I mean he doesn't have like I'll revert back to stance.

533
00:31:31.750 --> 00:31:32.920
He might stand south Paul.

534
00:31:32.921 --> 00:31:37.490
He might stand orthodox and he can do both equally well.
Yeah.

535
00:31:37.630 --> 00:31:41.380
Well I'm naturally either ride with my,
where my left hand naturally,

536
00:31:41.410 --> 00:31:45.040
but I stand orthologs I served for I skate.

537
00:31:45.090 --> 00:31:48.640
Orthox well there's a lot of people,
I mean that was what,
uh,

538
00:31:48.670 --> 00:31:52.720
Eddie fuck used to or manual steward rather used to teach guys to do that.

539
00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:55.090
He would take a guy who was right handed and make them fight.

540
00:31:55.091 --> 00:31:59.740
Southpaws like you want that lead hand to be your most coordinated hand.
Yeah,

541
00:31:59.741 --> 00:32:00.460
but we have,

542
00:32:00.460 --> 00:32:03.910
we have pat sessions that I'll just stand softball at the whole time and I have

543
00:32:03.911 --> 00:32:04.810
no problem with it.
I,

544
00:32:05.650 --> 00:32:09.280
I in fact love spine softball and I love just switching.

545
00:32:09.730 --> 00:32:13.300
Do you feel like you're straight left hand has as much power as a straight right

546
00:32:13.301 --> 00:32:16.510
hand?
Sometimes.
Even more.
Really.
Sometimes even more.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I feel,

547
00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:19.270
I feel like I have power of,
of both hands.
Oh.
Almost equally.

548
00:32:19.630 --> 00:32:23.260
Just depends on the angle and where I'm catching it as a trial to try to catch

549
00:32:23.261 --> 00:32:27.070
people at the same time as they're trying to get away from my right hand.

550
00:32:27.370 --> 00:32:30.820
I'll switch stances and aggressively switched into,
into the,
uh,

551
00:32:30.850 --> 00:32:34.480
that left hand and they get a power hand and they think they're getting away

552
00:32:34.481 --> 00:32:35.051
from my power him.

553
00:32:35.051 --> 00:32:39.560
But really there were walking into it and I make him switch into it.
Ah,
yeah.
Now,

554
00:32:39.561 --> 00:32:43.010
so when you were working with Cody,
did they,

555
00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:45.770
did they have any requests that they say,
Hey,

556
00:32:45.771 --> 00:32:49.360
this is what code is trying to work on?
You know,
it just really just,

557
00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:51.140
I was just switching a lot of trying to get him that,

558
00:32:51.230 --> 00:32:55.190
that switch left that switch hook that he got caught with last time and I was

559
00:32:55.191 --> 00:32:58.070
trying to just be a good teammate and you give him head kicks in that kind of

560
00:32:58.071 --> 00:33:02.390
movement and he was doing fairly well,
um,
blocking kicks coming back,

561
00:33:02.860 --> 00:33:04.950
uh,
and trying to wrestle more.
But because I had,

562
00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:07.610
I think they were talking about that was one thing that he lacked in the first

563
00:33:07.611 --> 00:33:11.160
fight.
Not Wrestling him enough.
Yeah,
yeah.
Yeah.
Well what,

564
00:33:11.161 --> 00:33:14.450
what happens Saturday was definitely not the game plan.
You're not,
you could,

565
00:33:14.510 --> 00:33:16.540
you could see it was it,

566
00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:19.640
it wasn't anything like he sparred and it wasn't anything like he trained,

567
00:33:19.641 --> 00:33:24.110
I think emotion absolutely took over.
Yeah.
Well,
so what was their game plan?

568
00:33:27.230 --> 00:33:30.740
I think just pieced him up,
get him,
you know,
catch him like the first round,

569
00:33:30.741 --> 00:33:31.790
but actually finish the fight.

570
00:33:31.850 --> 00:33:36.490
I think that would have been more than obviously kick him a lot and just get him

571
00:33:36.491 --> 00:33:39.800
to walk into something.
Try to wrestle him a little bit in there too.
I think,

572
00:33:40.070 --> 00:33:43.070
I think Tj came out really smart as well though.
Well,

573
00:33:43.071 --> 00:33:47.000
TJ throws himself into the fire too.
He's,
he's not,
he does not play it safe game.

574
00:33:47.001 --> 00:33:49.730
Yeah.
Oh,
he didn't,
he did not Saturday.
And I,
and I think that,

575
00:33:49.790 --> 00:33:53.660
I think that he was probably a little surprised by how,
um,

576
00:33:53.810 --> 00:33:58.100
just by how unsafe Cody was so early.
Like,
I mean,

577
00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:01.040
that exchange at the end,
I mean it's the Cody,

578
00:34:01.041 --> 00:34:05.210
I mean Tj is just blocking and looking and going.
He is just going for broke,

579
00:34:05.211 --> 00:34:08.360
right.
Everything he's throwing.
Yeah.
And we,

580
00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:10.220
when we were watching the replays,

581
00:34:10.221 --> 00:34:14.900
you could clearly see that Cody's path was wider and there's more strain.

582
00:34:14.930 --> 00:34:17.780
And then Tj was more loose and he got there quicker,
you know,

583
00:34:17.781 --> 00:34:21.560
and they'll knock down the first knocked down when he tagged me the right hand.

584
00:34:21.950 --> 00:34:24.590
That was really where it came from.
They're both throwing at the same time.

585
00:34:24.591 --> 00:34:27.260
But TJ was also doing a better job of getting his head offline.

586
00:34:27.890 --> 00:34:32.780
And the thing is like,
t Jay's relationship with Duane Ludwig is very unusual.

587
00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:35.410
It's like,
those guys are like glue.
I mean they're,

588
00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:40.190
they're fucking stuck together.
And Dwayne is a maniac.
You know,

589
00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:43.160
Dwayne,
I know Duane,
I've known Dwayne a long time.

590
00:34:43.161 --> 00:34:48.140
We are friends and when we coached against each other that the ultimate fighter,

591
00:34:48.170 --> 00:34:49.380
he literally in the parking lot,

592
00:34:49.381 --> 00:34:53.240
it reminded me that he had the fastest knockout in UFC history because he was

593
00:34:53.241 --> 00:34:54.850
fucking pissed.
Like he,
he,

594
00:34:55.010 --> 00:34:58.670
he's just one of those guys that who's pissed about what,

595
00:34:58.730 --> 00:35:01.310
just because we were trying to,

596
00:35:01.610 --> 00:35:04.880
he had a training practice that he invited all of Henry's guys too,

597
00:35:04.881 --> 00:35:06.860
but Henry couldn't come.
And I was like,
well,

598
00:35:06.861 --> 00:35:10.190
I'm going to have Johnson on come in and Joe can't come.
And he's like,

599
00:35:10.191 --> 00:35:12.560
hey listen,
I'm going to whip my dick out right now.
I'm going to remind you,

600
00:35:12.561 --> 00:35:15.320
I've got the fastest knockout in UFC history,
so you better calm down boy.

601
00:35:15.830 --> 00:35:19.430
And I'm like,
well,
okay.
But so he's very emotional.

602
00:35:19.431 --> 00:35:23.390
He's very focused and he's very dedicated to Tj.

603
00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:28.120
So I'm agreeing with you on that.
But he will go zero like that.
Oh yeah.
Doing,

604
00:35:28.121 --> 00:35:31.370
it's crazy as fuck.
I know very,
very well.

605
00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:35.450
But what I'm saying is that Duane is obsessed with,

606
00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:38.370
with t J's performance and with Tj is improvement.

607
00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:43.400
<v 2>When TJ first beat Hanan Barao Dwayne sat down with me.
We sat down,</v>

608
00:35:43.420 --> 00:35:45.270
we had lunch together that day and he was just,

609
00:35:45.271 --> 00:35:47.070
and it was a fucking big underdog.

610
00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:49.980
I mean Hanan Barao was thought to be the best pound for pound fighter if not

611
00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:55.100
number one,
certainly number two,
same way he did that,
I was like,
Jesus Christ.

612
00:35:55.150 --> 00:35:58.980
Also,
the way he did it,
he came out so loose like he was sparring.

613
00:35:59.250 --> 00:36:01.170
He came out like,
you know,
like the touch gloves,

614
00:36:01.171 --> 00:36:04.290
like he was going to do a sparring session and it looked like a guy sparred with

615
00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:07.780
a fucking hundred rounds.
It wasn't,
there was no tension to him.

616
00:36:07.781 --> 00:36:12.550
It was very loose.
He really loves that Shit.
He loves it.
He's a,

617
00:36:12.570 --> 00:36:16.080
he's a rise to the occasion Kinda guy.
Tj Is,

618
00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:20.730
and that's one of the reasons why I think he really thrived off this rivalry

619
00:36:20.731 --> 00:36:21.564
with Cody.

620
00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:25.980
Whereas with Cody specially because Tj won the first fight and won it by knock

621
00:36:25.981 --> 00:36:26.760
out,
you know,

622
00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:31.760
Cody like had all this inner tension where TJ had this inner smile like through

623
00:36:31.981 --> 00:36:34.230
the entire process.
Yeah,
definitely.

624
00:36:34.231 --> 00:36:37.260
I definitely agree with you and I think Cody was definitely,

625
00:36:37.470 --> 00:36:39.820
it seemed that he was a little more emotional with the two [inaudible]

626
00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:42.450
<v 4>and one thing that I,
and what we're talking about,</v>

627
00:36:42.451 --> 00:36:46.260
emotions and fights and everything and one thing that I always remember when

628
00:36:46.261 --> 00:36:47.380
they get emotional,
like even,

629
00:36:47.420 --> 00:36:49.860
and it happens in the sparring sessions and you know,

630
00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:53.280
it might happen in fights and stuff and I always remember Karen and telling me,

631
00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:55.020
you want to be,

632
00:36:55.070 --> 00:36:56.060
<v 2>that's your phone bro.</v>

633
00:37:02.210 --> 00:37:04.850
How dare you?
How dare you shut that piece of shit.

634
00:37:06.980 --> 00:37:09.160
Now you got Siri going,
you don't even know how to use a phone.

635
00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:14.520
<v 4>Oh,
I know you're one handed it.
Like as if no one's going to notice.</v>

636
00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:19.270
I am it out of the way.
Volume.
It's still odd.
It's dead.
I killed it.

637
00:37:20.350 --> 00:37:21.940
Go on guest on.
Anyways,

638
00:37:21.970 --> 00:37:26.140
I always remember hours,

639
00:37:26.141 --> 00:37:27.250
remember Kerry and telling me,

640
00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:30.330
because I will get emotional at times and I will let my,

641
00:37:30.410 --> 00:37:34.950
my Peruvian machismo get in the way.
And I was,
you know,

642
00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:37.180
especially like it will happen a lot with Kevin.
You know,

643
00:37:37.210 --> 00:37:41.950
like when Kevin first came to see us,
Kim Ross for Kevin first came to CSA.

644
00:37:43.210 --> 00:37:47.320
Man,
those were all would get beat up a lot.

645
00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:51.010
Call it tough love.
I don't know what you want to call it.

646
00:37:51.011 --> 00:37:54.550
But he was sweet me and beat me up and like,

647
00:37:54.630 --> 00:37:57.580
ah well you want them to give it your best.
And He,

648
00:37:57.640 --> 00:37:59.610
and he made me better heat turned.

649
00:37:59.860 --> 00:38:02.680
He turned me into a training partner versus like somebody,

650
00:38:02.681 --> 00:38:07.060
he had to like my by heat and baby me at any moment.
He,
I built,

651
00:38:07.300 --> 00:38:10.530
he built me into what I am saying we became training partners and,

652
00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:12.610
but one thing they always remember from Karen's,

653
00:38:12.611 --> 00:38:15.970
like you don't want to be emotional.
You want to be like an assassin,
you know,

654
00:38:15.971 --> 00:38:18.880
you want to be,
you want to go in there and be calculator.

655
00:38:18.881 --> 00:38:22.270
You want to be yourself.
Cause that's when I fight the best when I'm myself.

656
00:38:22.271 --> 00:38:23.680
And now when I have no emotion.

657
00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:28.260
<v 2>Do you have any sort of a pre fight routine that you go through mentally in</v>

658
00:38:28.261 --> 00:38:29.910
order to get yourself into a state of mind?
Like,

659
00:38:30.300 --> 00:38:35.300
<v 4>you know,
the,
uh,
recently since,
uh,
I,
I lost a,
I don't know if you watch my,</v>

660
00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:39.360
my last year's fine,
my second,
uh,
a fiber bells where I guess I got,

661
00:38:39.820 --> 00:38:42.910
I got dropped I guess submitted you got hit with a wheel kit.
We'll,

662
00:38:42.940 --> 00:38:45.910
we'll get gay and see it come out with the triangled how's it going through a

663
00:38:45.911 --> 00:38:48.160
lot of the time of going through a divorce,
you know,

664
00:38:48.250 --> 00:38:52.350
very emotional time of my life last year.
And then I had to,
you know,

665
00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:54.690
dig deep and rise to the occasion and you know,

666
00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:57.760
get out of that hole that I was in.
Um,

667
00:38:57.820 --> 00:39:00.040
so I started grounding my energy before fights.

668
00:39:00.041 --> 00:39:03.850
I was trying to like try to visualize and really see myself,
you know,

669
00:39:03.851 --> 00:39:07.180
doing the things that I would do because that's how I got a lot of my knockouts,

670
00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:10.660
uh,
in lion fight.
I could,
it was the weirdest thing.

671
00:39:10.661 --> 00:39:14.260
I could just visualize and see it.
Like when I knocked out Tyler toner,

672
00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:18.490
I saw that happening before the fight even.
And I was like,

673
00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:20.620
it felt like a Deja Vu moment.
Like,
Oh shit.

674
00:39:20.621 --> 00:39:25.621
Like I've seen this happen and I just like try to like get us calm as I possibly

675
00:39:26.981 --> 00:39:30.560
can.
I just remind myself there's another day in the office and like I've had 50,

676
00:39:30.670 --> 00:39:34.900
almost 50 fights now and I just know that regardless of what happens,

677
00:39:34.901 --> 00:39:37.210
where I win or lose,
I'm like go out there and give it my best.

678
00:39:37.720 --> 00:39:42.000
But what I try to do is to just try to like close my eyes and like,
um,

679
00:39:42.190 --> 00:39:43.810
I call it grinding myself.

680
00:39:43.811 --> 00:39:48.811
I visualize like roots coming out of my feet and hands and I,

681
00:39:49.750 --> 00:39:54.580
I really like ground myself and ground my energy and to visualize roots.
Yeah.

682
00:39:54.700 --> 00:39:58.820
Like tree roads coming out of my hands and coming out on my feet and I like the,

683
00:39:58.830 --> 00:40:00.370
this last fight was crazy actually.

684
00:40:00.371 --> 00:40:04.720
I could visualize it like going all the way into the ring and like once I walked

685
00:40:04.721 --> 00:40:05.710
in there,
I just felt like home.

686
00:40:06.460 --> 00:40:10.000
<v 2>Oh Wow.
Crazy.
Yeah.
And I don't think I told,</v>

687
00:40:10.001 --> 00:40:14.380
I even told him that just something that you read how to do or is this something

688
00:40:14.381 --> 00:40:15.490
that someone coached you?

689
00:40:15.770 --> 00:40:20.380
<v 4>Actually,
my ex wife taught me how to do.
Funny enough.
Uh,</v>

690
00:40:21.220 --> 00:40:23.740
she taught me how to do that and I just like,
I thought I was like,

691
00:40:23.750 --> 00:40:26.090
she's fucking bullshitting.
Anyways,
I tried it.

692
00:40:26.240 --> 00:40:30.600
And you tried after you got divorced.
That's hilarious.
Yeah.
Thanks.
Right.

693
00:40:32.190 --> 00:40:36.960
Yeah.
You've got the roots and he got the kickoffs.
She was right.
I did.

694
00:40:37.010 --> 00:40:39.410
I texted her a while back and I was like,
you were right.

695
00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:43.670
This shit works in this crazy eye.
You know that along with some Alpha brain,

696
00:40:43.790 --> 00:40:47.150
I go out there and I'm like,
I'm ready to rock and roll.
I feel at home

697
00:40:47.810 --> 00:40:50.090
<v 2>now what,
what I was getting to was that,</v>

698
00:40:50.091 --> 00:40:55.091
that relationship between a coach and athlete when it works out great,

699
00:40:55.460 --> 00:40:59.870
it's so important.
And when you don't have that,
like,
I mean,

700
00:40:59.900 --> 00:41:03.380
there's no disrespect for debt to Danny Castillo and Chris Holdsworth who were

701
00:41:03.381 --> 00:41:07.340
both were very good fighters and I'm sure a dedicated,

702
00:41:07.341 --> 00:41:11.060
but Dwayne is a different kind of thing.
I mean,

703
00:41:11.061 --> 00:41:15.710
he obsesses on various techniques and improvements and foot works and how to

704
00:41:15.711 --> 00:41:18.520
change things and how to,
how to set things up.
He's,

705
00:41:18.590 --> 00:41:21.770
he's all day 24 seven,
he never shuts off.

706
00:41:22.130 --> 00:41:27.130
And the kind of relationship that Dwayne has with Tj is so rare and so

707
00:41:27.621 --> 00:41:28.460
beneficial,

708
00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:33.080
but that the kind of relationship you guys have this kind of really tight

709
00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:37.850
between coach and fighter.
It,
if it's theirs,

710
00:41:37.910 --> 00:41:42.530
you can win without it,
but when you have it,
it is just so powerful.

711
00:41:42.531 --> 00:41:43.370
It's so powerful.

712
00:41:43.580 --> 00:41:48.180
<v 1>Powerful.
I feel like I like,
it's crazy now,
like when I'm warming up,
like I,</v>

713
00:41:48.220 --> 00:41:52.780
I can see he's getting nervous for me,
but I kind of get,
I,
I,

714
00:41:53.090 --> 00:41:55.620
I see,
I was,
oh shit,
he's worried about me,
you know?
But it makes,

715
00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:59.270
it makes me want to like go in there and like make him proud,
you know?
And like,

716
00:41:59.271 --> 00:42:03.680
I know he's gonna be,
he's gonna be there regardless.
Yeah.
It's crazy.
But like,

717
00:42:03.681 --> 00:42:06.570
I can see,
like,
he,
he tries to hide it as,
oh,
I'm fine.
Like,
you know,
like,

718
00:42:06.580 --> 00:42:11.480
let's get warm,
but I can,
I can just see like that.
Like,

719
00:42:11.481 --> 00:42:14.330
he's getting nervous for me.
You know,
I said,

720
00:42:14.331 --> 00:42:17.870
that just makes me want to do better and go in there and listen to him and just,

721
00:42:18.090 --> 00:42:21.720
<v 2>well,
you also got to realize how fortunate you are to found him.
I mean,</v>

722
00:42:21.721 --> 00:42:22.290
there's just,

723
00:42:22.290 --> 00:42:27.290
there's not a lot of great Moitai coaches in America where I live out here.

724
00:42:29.220 --> 00:42:31.390
Good luck.
Find a gym to even train at this.

725
00:42:31.490 --> 00:42:34.050
You mean you can go to some guy who's going to hold pads for you,

726
00:42:34.051 --> 00:42:37.710
but like as far as like Legit Moy coaching in the valley,
I mean,

727
00:42:37.711 --> 00:42:42.570
you've got Saxxon,
uh,
or you've got 'em yeah.
On and uh,

728
00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:46.710
Julio out in a van eyes.
Yeah.
But that's,
you know,
it's a half hour,

729
00:42:46.711 --> 00:42:47.910
45 minutes away from here.

730
00:42:48.630 --> 00:42:50.830
<v 1>Like,
just over this traffic,
man.
Jesus.
Yeah.</v>

731
00:42:50.860 --> 00:42:53.230
That's our 45 minutes at two o'clock in the morning.

732
00:42:54.970 --> 00:42:57.220
Three it'll take you two hours there.
Yeah.

733
00:42:57.320 --> 00:42:57.621
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

734
00:42:57.621 --> 00:43:02.621
I mean the fact that you just stumbled upon him and this lucky way when you were

735
00:43:03.231 --> 00:43:03.920
that young.

736
00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:06.430
<v 1>Well,
like I said,
we just clicked,
man.
Yeah.
It just click the,</v>

737
00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:09.620
after I lost that fight against that kid with 80 plus fights.

738
00:43:10.130 --> 00:43:11.900
We just clicked and then I started,

739
00:43:12.020 --> 00:43:16.170
I didn't work my conditioning at all back then.
Like I,
I just ran and training.

740
00:43:16.870 --> 00:43:17.080
<v 2>I mean,</v>

741
00:43:17.080 --> 00:43:22.080
you have a fucking giant crossfit gym and just know your gym is not just Moy

742
00:43:22.990 --> 00:43:25.240
Tai.
You have a massive fucking gym.

743
00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:27.980
<v 1>Well,
yeah,
I mean we started out at 5,000 square feet.</v>

744
00:43:27.981 --> 00:43:30.740
Then three years later we went to 12.
Now we're at 25.

745
00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:33.920
Jesus crossfits standalone.
And again,

746
00:43:33.921 --> 00:43:37.130
I have a lot of my people don't use crossfit.
Like Kevin,
he can't keep muscle on.

747
00:43:37.131 --> 00:43:39.380
So he powerlifts with our power lifting coach Jesse Burdick.

748
00:43:39.381 --> 00:43:41.210
He doesn't do crossfit because it's,
it's,

749
00:43:41.211 --> 00:43:45.350
he needs to keep weight on Gaston crossfits.
Um,
and then,

750
00:43:45.410 --> 00:43:47.120
so for us,
everything,

751
00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:52.160
What's unique about our gym is that everything's kind of done under the same

752
00:43:52.161 --> 00:43:56.030
roof.
I don't do a lot of guests coaching.
I'm doing it with the,

753
00:43:56.060 --> 00:44:00.650
with the Alpha male guys because Alex Munoz is coaching wrestling for us.

754
00:44:00.651 --> 00:44:04.160
And I felt for me that was one area that as a gym we needed to grow.

755
00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:06.380
So Alex comes in and coaches,

756
00:44:06.381 --> 00:44:10.940
so I coach his standup and it's been a good beneficial relationship for both

757
00:44:10.941 --> 00:44:14.990
gyms.
Um,
but I don't go there and coach those guys will come down.

758
00:44:14.991 --> 00:44:17.570
Benito works with me now.
Alex works with me.

759
00:44:17.750 --> 00:44:21.710
He'll put Ricardo Ramos who just fought.
Ricardo comes down,
you know,

760
00:44:22.220 --> 00:44:24.560
for the rest of the class we'll have a little sparring session,

761
00:44:24.561 --> 00:44:29.330
like small gloves.
Oh,
we have a full sized cage.
So it's very beneficial.

762
00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:31.980
And then we'll just,
we'll just do like a round Robin type

763
00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:32.281
<v 4>of thing.</v>

764
00:44:32.281 --> 00:44:36.450
Like one goes in the other ones out and this great like I get really good look

765
00:44:36.451 --> 00:44:36.610
for me.

766
00:44:36.610 --> 00:44:41.290
<v 2>Those guys.
What made the decision for you to do three different sports?</v>

767
00:44:41.291 --> 00:44:44.260
Like why not dedicate yourself to one?
Okay.

768
00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:47.890
<v 4>Well I was,
I was,
I started purely as a Meu tie fighter.
Right.</v>

769
00:44:47.950 --> 00:44:50.500
And then the opportunities sound with Belzer came in.
I always,

770
00:44:50.530 --> 00:44:53.950
we always knew that MMA will be,
you know,
where we will end up.

771
00:44:53.951 --> 00:44:58.630
But I just love fighting.
I love fighting.
I love Moyie Thai.

772
00:44:58.631 --> 00:45:02.860
Obviously if I can,
if I could just do more tight,
I'll probably do that.
But,

773
00:45:02.950 --> 00:45:06.340
so if Moitai had the same financial possibilities,
you know,

774
00:45:06.420 --> 00:45:09.760
I used to say that a lot,
actually let me correct myself there.
But now it's like,

775
00:45:10.990 --> 00:45:11.823
I feel,

776
00:45:12.160 --> 00:45:17.160
I feel like I'm getting so much better and like completing my journey as a

777
00:45:17.291 --> 00:45:21.970
martial artist that MMA is definitely where I want to end up at just alone.

778
00:45:22.450 --> 00:45:25.630
And then we had the opportunity with belters to do kickboxing and in the May and

779
00:45:25.631 --> 00:45:28.150
then maybe do a few more.
I fights on the side if,
you know,

780
00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:30.430
it didn't interrupt with anything with,
uh,
with them.

781
00:45:31.090 --> 00:45:33.370
So that's pretty much how it happened.
I mean,
he fought,

782
00:45:33.371 --> 00:45:37.510
he fought five times last year.
Um,
you know,
any fought kickboxing,

783
00:45:37.660 --> 00:45:39.220
MMA and Moyie Thai.

784
00:45:39.820 --> 00:45:42.490
<v 2>If he was just like with the UFC,
he couldn't do that.</v>

785
00:45:42.850 --> 00:45:45.730
I think Moitai prepares you better for MMA.

786
00:45:45.780 --> 00:45:48.460
Then kickboxing does not just because of the fact you have elbows,

787
00:45:48.670 --> 00:45:50.320
but also because of the fact that the clinic,

788
00:45:50.500 --> 00:45:53.980
<v 4>the grappling and the people that people don't understand how much grappling</v>

789
00:45:54.220 --> 00:45:58.850
there is tight.
Like when you go to Thailand,
I went to six something on,
uh,

790
00:45:59.320 --> 00:46:03.520
one of the best camps in,
uh,
in Bangkok and one of the best camps in the world.

791
00:46:03.521 --> 00:46:07.720
They have said a child was like right now the glory champion,
uh,
one 55.

792
00:46:08.350 --> 00:46:12.970
Uh,
but they clinch twice a day for at least 31 hour,

793
00:46:13.030 --> 00:46:16.720
30 minutes to an hour every day.
That's a lot of grappling,

794
00:46:17.500 --> 00:46:22.500
a lot of grappling and just their ability to rec manipulate each other.

795
00:46:22.960 --> 00:46:25.600
And I think that's one,
that's one thing that has helped me,

796
00:46:25.930 --> 00:46:29.140
has helped my understanding and the wrestling and Jitsu as well.

797
00:46:29.170 --> 00:46:32.960
I pick up things a lot faster than your average Muay Thai fighter.

798
00:46:32.961 --> 00:46:35.320
He probably does just because of that clench.

799
00:46:35.860 --> 00:46:38.380
<v 2>So,
um,
how much do you do too?
Are you doing,</v>

800
00:46:39.350 --> 00:46:43.310
<v 4>uh,
what do we focus on right now?
So we have Monday,</v>

801
00:46:43.580 --> 00:46:48.410
about four days a week or four days a week.
Oh,
Jujitsu,
a couple of days of just,

802
00:46:48.540 --> 00:46:52.010
uh,
drills and situational sparring.

803
00:46:52.500 --> 00:46:56.530
<v 2>So when you're doing a fight,
like your last Beltour fight,
which you just one,</v>

804
00:46:56.531 --> 00:47:00.800
was it two weeks ago?
Three weeks ago?
Three weeks ago,
three weeks ago.
So when,

805
00:47:00.850 --> 00:47:04.750
when you're doing that,
how far out will you just do kickboxing?

806
00:47:05.080 --> 00:47:07.510
Like how much time do you give yourself when you don't do anything else?

807
00:47:07.511 --> 00:47:11.380
Or do you still wrestle and still Jujitsu even though you're

808
00:47:11.620 --> 00:47:16.260
<v 4>probably still,
I'm fairly new to MMA and to grappling alone,</v>

809
00:47:16.290 --> 00:47:20.280
so I try to just keep a couple of days a week and there so I can,
you know,

810
00:47:20.370 --> 00:47:24.630
keep a fresh,
you know,
cause I'm fighting September 29th again,
MMA.

811
00:47:25.290 --> 00:47:27.950
So who are you fighting?
I don't know yet.
We don't have a,

812
00:47:27.980 --> 00:47:29.960
I don't think we have an appointment.
They haven't done it yet.

813
00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:34.650
<v 2>It's a month away.
Give you an opponent.
It's like six,
like six weeks away.
Yeah,</v>

814
00:47:34.710 --> 00:47:39.670
yeah,
yeah.
Not rounds around eight weeks,
something like that.
Yeah,

815
00:47:40.120 --> 00:47:44.350
something like that.
It's what is today?
The fifth,
6th of August.

816
00:47:44.410 --> 00:47:47.680
6th of August.
Yeah.
Sounds almost take weeks.
Yeah.
Um,

817
00:47:47.700 --> 00:47:52.700
so they give you an opponent and then you have to decide how to prepare.

818
00:47:52.900 --> 00:47:56.890
Like if it's a stand up fighter,
we just ramp up the standup more.

819
00:47:57.650 --> 00:48:01.490
<v 4>Well most of these guys,
even in the very may,
fighters in their standup guys,</v>

820
00:48:01.491 --> 00:48:02.090
they're getting,

821
00:48:02.090 --> 00:48:04.700
I feel like they're going to try to take me down regardless if they find the

822
00:48:04.701 --> 00:48:07.430
opportunity.
Once it,
once they,
they get cracked,

823
00:48:08.070 --> 00:48:11.390
they're going to want to go on the ground regardless.
So we're always trying to,

824
00:48:11.391 --> 00:48:14.390
you know,
work on getting right back up,
you know,

825
00:48:14.391 --> 00:48:16.100
working on keeping control if we're,

826
00:48:16.101 --> 00:48:18.380
if we're in their guards so we don't get submitted with anything.

827
00:48:18.440 --> 00:48:21.440
Like it happened last year in September,
September 23rd.

828
00:48:22.040 --> 00:48:24.830
So we're always what was trying to work all areas regardless.

829
00:48:24.831 --> 00:48:26.720
And I'm always trying to,
as a martial artist,

830
00:48:26.721 --> 00:48:29.720
I always want to be ready for anything that could possibly happen.
You know,

831
00:48:29.721 --> 00:48:33.410
you never,
it's a fight man.
Like anything can happen,
anything can happen,

832
00:48:33.411 --> 00:48:37.520
you know,
and like people always watch tape and fight.
As a fighter,

833
00:48:37.550 --> 00:48:41.570
I've learned that I can involve so much and just six to eight weeks,
you know,

834
00:48:41.571 --> 00:48:45.800
which is like what people have as camps and so you never know who you're going

835
00:48:45.801 --> 00:48:49.310
to get when you're like in front of them,
in the,
in the,
in the cage.

836
00:48:49.340 --> 00:48:51.320
So I'm most trying to be ready for anything.

837
00:48:51.570 --> 00:48:53.070
<v 2>Do you think there's ever going to come a time,</v>

838
00:48:53.160 --> 00:48:54.930
where are you getting to the championship level?

839
00:48:54.931 --> 00:48:59.790
We just stop fighting more and stop fighting kickboxing and just concentrate on

840
00:48:59.791 --> 00:49:00.620
MMA?

841
00:49:00.620 --> 00:49:01.610
<v 4>Yeah,
probably.
I think,</v>

842
00:49:01.611 --> 00:49:04.760
I think that there's definitely going to be a time that I'm only going to be an

843
00:49:04.761 --> 00:49:07.400
MMA fighter.
I definitely see that in the future.
I'll,

844
00:49:07.460 --> 00:49:11.900
I'll also like to be like one of the first guys to hold a kickbox and bell that,

845
00:49:11.901 --> 00:49:16.020
oh,
I didn't know like Belzer kickboxing world championship.
Uh,

846
00:49:16.160 --> 00:49:18.620
and be like a top contender.
I want to be definitely that,

847
00:49:18.680 --> 00:49:22.430
that kind of guy that can do,
they can prove that they can do both.
You know,

848
00:49:22.431 --> 00:49:23.990
at a hide a super high level.

849
00:49:24.570 --> 00:49:28.320
<v 2>It's a,
it's interesting.
Bell tour is really starting to make progress.</v>

850
00:49:28.410 --> 00:49:32.270
I mean they,
they have real legit world class fighters now.
You know,

851
00:49:32.310 --> 00:49:36.480
they have gay garden.
We saw sees arguably if not the best,

852
00:49:36.481 --> 00:49:39.630
one of the best 185 pounders in the world.
I mean,
in my opinion,

853
00:49:39.631 --> 00:49:43.840
he's right up there with Robert Whitaker and he's willing to,
the marrow is,

854
00:49:43.870 --> 00:49:48.450
his striking is he's a beast.
Jeez.
I'm a big fan of massage.
Yeah,

855
00:49:48.451 --> 00:49:50.700
I am too.
But he's super well rounded too.

856
00:49:50.730 --> 00:49:55.680
I mean with everything and it just so calm.
His demeanor,
his mentality.
He's,
he's,

857
00:49:55.710 --> 00:50:00.150
he's an assassin like legitimate acid as his Roy MacDonald and they're both,

858
00:50:00.240 --> 00:50:03.650
yeah,
that's the car that I'm fighting on.
I'm super excited.
Come on.

859
00:50:03.690 --> 00:50:06.150
That made you decide to make like why the fuck would you do that?

860
00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:10.320
Like I don't understand why you would take,
arguably you're your best two guys

861
00:50:12.410 --> 00:50:15.780
fight and they're not even in the same weight class.
I mean,
I guess to me,

862
00:50:15.781 --> 00:50:16.770
I super fight.

863
00:50:17.040 --> 00:50:20.640
There's pressure with the super fight movement with the UFC for Bella Torta to

864
00:50:20.641 --> 00:50:24.540
keep up.
I know.
I think there's,
there's,
there's probably,
and again,

865
00:50:24.590 --> 00:50:27.950
it might not be Scott's idea.
Might be Paramount's idea.
Don't know.

866
00:50:27.990 --> 00:50:30.510
<v 0>Well it could very well be Rory and k Garth's idea too.</v>

867
00:50:31.120 --> 00:50:34.730
I mean they might call each other out right away as a massage.

868
00:50:34.731 --> 00:50:39.080
He became the champion of one in five.
They were like,
listen man,
fucking psycho.

869
00:50:39.330 --> 00:50:44.210
I mean he's a legit fucking psycho in the best way possible.
It was really good.

870
00:50:44.211 --> 00:50:48.510
God,
you get to know him at all.
Not at all.
Wait,
we're both on the on,
on,
uh,

871
00:50:48.740 --> 00:50:52.660
the monster team with Hans and all those guys.
Oh,
shout out to hands on.
Yeah.

872
00:50:53.210 --> 00:50:56.570
Yeah man.
Try and try and be knighted.
Yeah,
I got it.

873
00:50:56.600 --> 00:50:58.070
He just sent me a bunch of gloves and shit.

874
00:50:58.071 --> 00:51:01.160
And you guys were saying that bags of the best backs.
Yeah,
definitely.
Absolutely.

875
00:51:01.420 --> 00:51:05.010
His gloves,
the death adder,
they go,
I don't know if you,
I think,

876
00:51:05.070 --> 00:51:08.060
I think as I have a pair,
it's my favorite glove.
He makes great gloves.

877
00:51:08.120 --> 00:51:11.240
Favorite glove.
Oh,
knows his shit.
Yeah,
definitely.
Um,

878
00:51:11.300 --> 00:51:15.300
so what we're just saying,
we were talking about Rory.
Oh,

879
00:51:16.840 --> 00:51:17.780
what I was saying is like,

880
00:51:18.140 --> 00:51:22.430
people had this idea of who he was and then he came on and did my podcast.

881
00:51:22.670 --> 00:51:25.730
And people are like,
oh,
he's fucking normal.
He's a good guy.

882
00:51:26.060 --> 00:51:29.330
Like everybody thought he was like this autistic.
So I go,
yeah,

883
00:51:29.340 --> 00:51:31.670
he never Muni came with you but just wouldn't never met people.

884
00:51:31.700 --> 00:51:35.480
From what I heard from Hans,
he's like a super nice guy.
Very smart,

885
00:51:35.660 --> 00:51:39.410
very intelligent.
He's funny actually.
You know,

886
00:51:39.411 --> 00:51:42.830
it's just his fight with Lawler was like one of my favorite fight.

887
00:51:42.831 --> 00:51:46.640
The fulltime Jesus Christ.
What a crazy fight.

888
00:51:47.300 --> 00:51:49.970
First Time I ever saw him was when he fought Nate.
I was there with,

889
00:51:49.971 --> 00:51:54.210
when Jake fought GSP cornering.
Jake has candida,
right?
It was in Canada,

890
00:51:54.230 --> 00:51:57.390
in Toronto.
And uh,
I didn't know who he was and,

891
00:51:57.400 --> 00:52:01.520
and I watched that fight for the back and I was just like,
Holy Shit,

892
00:52:01.550 --> 00:52:03.500
this kid is phenomenal.

893
00:52:04.280 --> 00:52:07.010
And I don't think anybody anticipated his level of wrestling at that time.

894
00:52:07.011 --> 00:52:11.240
I think may thought he was going to be up to slap them up.
And,
uh,
you know,

895
00:52:11.241 --> 00:52:14.000
that after that I became a huge,
huge fan.
I mean,

896
00:52:14.001 --> 00:52:18.820
obviously Nate's my boy and I love Nate and you know,
to wrong weight class.
Yeah,

897
00:52:19.080 --> 00:52:23.140
absolutely.
I mean,
one thing to fight Conor at one 70,
but Rory,

898
00:52:23.141 --> 00:52:25.160
he's giant one 70,

899
00:52:25.161 --> 00:52:30.161
and he's also training with GSP and just Tristar and I'm a giant fan of for Rasa

900
00:52:31.341 --> 00:52:34.430
hobby and what he's managed to put together up there in Montreal,

901
00:52:34.760 --> 00:52:38.300
they just have a camp that's just,
it's just such an elite camp,
you know,

902
00:52:38.301 --> 00:52:42.400
it's just a different,
different level of,
uh,
of,
uh,

903
00:52:42.720 --> 00:52:46.970
just well rounded fighters.
It's a fucking phenomenal place.
Foot,

904
00:52:47.120 --> 00:52:50.540
phenomenal,
phenomenal coach.
One of my favorites,
one of my favorite coaches.

905
00:52:50.541 --> 00:52:53.750
I'm excited to see Nate fight pour you and I'm excited to see neat back.

906
00:52:54.050 --> 00:52:57.860
You know,
I was,
I was wondering,
I was like,
fuck man,
it's been like two years.

907
00:52:57.890 --> 00:52:58.310
Yeah,

908
00:52:58.310 --> 00:53:01.670
I was surprised he took the fight and then I was also surprised that he was mad

909
00:53:01.790 --> 00:53:05.960
that they were doing,
uh,
controversies.
Khabib.
I didn't expect that at all.

910
00:53:06.020 --> 00:53:08.150
They're both Matt Dustin's mad too.
I was like,

911
00:53:08.151 --> 00:53:11.290
what the fuck are you guys mad for?
Well,
I thought Dustin was going to wait for,

912
00:53:11.370 --> 00:53:14.540
you know,
to get his title shot,
but I guess that fight makes sense man.

913
00:53:15.530 --> 00:53:19.220
He might not have got that title shot though.
Tony Ferguson's healing up,

914
00:53:19.280 --> 00:53:20.720
you know,
he's back in the mix.

915
00:53:20.810 --> 00:53:25.500
Who knows what's going to happen with a James Vick when James Vick is gonna

916
00:53:25.520 --> 00:53:26.520
fight 'em uh,

917
00:53:26.670 --> 00:53:31.670
Justin Gagey Vicks on I think at 10 or 11 fight win streak.

918
00:53:31.920 --> 00:53:36.500
That was something crazy like that Kras pounds
stacked.

919
00:53:36.600 --> 00:53:39.000
That's a stacked weight class man.
You know,

920
00:53:39.001 --> 00:53:43.470
and then you still have so many guys that are,
that are coming up that are,

921
00:53:43.500 --> 00:53:45.300
you know,
like one or two fights away.

922
00:53:45.480 --> 00:53:50.480
Then of course you got fucking Kevin Lee who in my opinion has the best argument

923
00:53:50.610 --> 00:53:54.390
for the next title shot.
He's a monster monster.
His last fight.

924
00:53:55.290 --> 00:53:59.280
So it's him.
Tony Ferguson.
When Tony's healthy again,
Tony's not 100% healthy,

925
00:53:59.550 --> 00:54:00.630
but I mean,
Dustin,

926
00:54:00.870 --> 00:54:04.380
I think it's right to take that fight because he's not the most compelling guy.

927
00:54:04.381 --> 00:54:08.430
I know he wants to,
but he just got knocked out by Michael Johnson a year ago.

928
00:54:08.750 --> 00:54:10.530
You know what I mean?
There's,
there's a lot,

929
00:54:10.531 --> 00:54:11.760
maybe a little bit more than a year ago,

930
00:54:13.560 --> 00:54:18.150
but it's like still and then you got to remember what Johnson when when Johnson

931
00:54:18.151 --> 00:54:21.270
fought Khabib,
Khabib,
Malden.
I mean there's a lot of,

932
00:54:21.590 --> 00:54:25.710
a lot of people in that weight class.
So Johnson went down to 45 though,
right?

933
00:54:25.860 --> 00:54:28.960
Yeah,
yeah.
Johnson's Johnson's fight in Philly.
Yeah.

934
00:54:29.910 --> 00:54:34.620
Philly's coming down to a training with us as well as his first fight at 45 to

935
00:54:34.621 --> 00:54:37.580
Darren Elkins and a,
and he looked really good physically look,

936
00:54:37.590 --> 00:54:41.550
he was ripped for the first time and he was shredded.
But I wonder like,
man,

937
00:54:41.580 --> 00:54:43.650
how much does he walk around that he's a big fellow.

938
00:54:44.050 --> 00:54:48.090
Like how much do you walk around that and how much does he depleting his body to

939
00:54:48.091 --> 00:54:50.490
get down to that 100 that's one thing.

940
00:54:50.491 --> 00:54:53.820
Like I don't think like some people like realize like,
yeah,
okay,

941
00:54:53.821 --> 00:54:57.510
you made the way.
You only come in like seven,
eight pounds like the night before,

942
00:54:57.511 --> 00:55:01.780
but we're depleting your body throughout like that camp.
Yeah,

943
00:55:01.830 --> 00:55:04.710
I think I can definitely,
you know,
people ask me like,
Hey,

944
00:55:04.711 --> 00:55:07.020
are you going to go to Bantam?
And I'm like,
fuck no man.
I like,

945
00:55:07.410 --> 00:55:08.820
I like feeling good throughout.

946
00:55:08.821 --> 00:55:13.130
You walk around at like one 62 oh that's not too bad.
Not Too.

947
00:55:13.200 --> 00:55:15.870
And that's what people tell me in pounds.
That's what people tell him.
He said,
Oh,

948
00:55:15.871 --> 00:55:17.640
you could probably make Bantam weight.
And I was like,
yeah man.

949
00:55:17.641 --> 00:55:20.460
But like I like to feel strong physically,

950
00:55:20.730 --> 00:55:25.080
mentally strong throughout my camp thing only cut like eight to 10 pounds.

951
00:55:25.290 --> 00:55:29.240
We don't,
we don't cut a lot of weight at CSA.
I don't smart,
I don't,

952
00:55:29.310 --> 00:55:32.140
I don't like it.
I don't want it.
And I,
and part of it is,
you know,

953
00:55:32.160 --> 00:55:36.300
I got this kid knocked out.
I'm telling you right now.
I got,
it was my,
as a coach,

954
00:55:36.630 --> 00:55:39.420
you have to own it.
It was my fault.
Fight Week.

955
00:55:39.421 --> 00:55:41.920
I'm going to take five extra pounds off of this kid,
you know,

956
00:55:41.970 --> 00:55:45.240
just because he's not going to fight.
Okay.
Then we don't fight.

957
00:55:45.960 --> 00:55:50.460
You learn as you go.
Um,
so no,
I have a 10% rule.

958
00:55:50.640 --> 00:55:54.420
I'll pull you like what one FC is doing.
You know,

959
00:55:54.450 --> 00:55:58.770
we had been asked her in here and he was explaining how one at one fc does these

960
00:55:58.771 --> 00:56:03.690
hydration tests.
They test you all the time.
They tests you several times.

961
00:56:03.691 --> 00:56:07.500
They find out what your actual weight is.
They test your hug [inaudible] levels.

962
00:56:07.550 --> 00:56:10.440
Yeah.
Several times they moved everybody up to weight class.

963
00:56:10.540 --> 00:56:15.090
They kept their champions,
but they made,
you know Ben,
instead of a one and 70,

964
00:56:15.091 --> 00:56:16.650
they made him a one 85 pound champ.

965
00:56:16.690 --> 00:56:20.570
California's doing hydration tests on fight day,
right?
Yes.
Yeah.

966
00:56:20.680 --> 00:56:24.100
Which I just fight day.
There were also,
I don't think it works that well.
No.
Well,

967
00:56:24.140 --> 00:56:29.140
they're also making you not weigh more than 10% more than what you weighed in

968
00:56:29.201 --> 00:56:32.350
and moved up a couple that they don't,
I don't think they find you.
You're,

969
00:56:32.440 --> 00:56:33.790
you're the first time you do it.

970
00:56:33.791 --> 00:56:37.240
They just like advice you to go up and they don't like,

971
00:56:37.280 --> 00:56:39.550
I think that on that allow you to fight at that same weight.

972
00:56:39.551 --> 00:56:44.110
If he's for a 200 pound fighter,
that's 20 fucking pounds.

973
00:56:44.170 --> 00:56:47.260
That's a lot of weight,
man.
That's a lot of weight.

974
00:56:47.470 --> 00:56:50.830
Like if I pulled 20 pounds of water out of my body right now,

975
00:56:50.831 --> 00:56:54.520
I mean I'd be stumbling in walls.
I mean you're on death's door.

976
00:56:54.590 --> 00:56:56.740
I mean you're not early.
You're not going to take shots the same way.

977
00:56:56.741 --> 00:57:00.940
You're just not fucking way and your Oregon's here's,
that's a big thing.

978
00:57:00.970 --> 00:57:05.560
Your Oregon start fucking up.
I know a guy who,
well I know someone who knows him.

979
00:57:05.770 --> 00:57:10.770
He was a in a bodybuilding competition and this is a 36 year old guy who's,

980
00:57:10.961 --> 00:57:13.750
you know,
just amateur bodybuilding competition,

981
00:57:14.050 --> 00:57:17.770
got down to a really low body fat and just really wanting to win the
competition.

982
00:57:17.770 --> 00:57:22.270
One and then two weeks afterwards his fucking body shutdown is Oregon started

983
00:57:22.271 --> 00:57:26.140
shutting down.
He had a heart attack.
It's family found him dead.
Just Dido.

984
00:57:26.141 --> 00:57:29.800
Hardtack 36 years old now the water comes out of the organs.

985
00:57:29.801 --> 00:57:34.400
Last and it goes back in last.
What's also the damage due to them.
Why?

986
00:57:34.430 --> 00:57:37.310
By depleting them and trying them out.
Your kidneys.

987
00:57:38.740 --> 00:57:41.050
Going back to that,
that fight that I got knocked out,

988
00:57:41.110 --> 00:57:43.750
I cut all that weight I made the way,
you know I was,

989
00:57:44.020 --> 00:57:47.830
I weighed in every but I couldn't keep water in.

990
00:57:48.430 --> 00:57:51.840
I just like,
I was drinking and like I just felt like shit I could,

991
00:57:51.860 --> 00:57:54.880
I couldn't like I went to bed probably like only a couple of pounds heavier

992
00:57:54.881 --> 00:57:58.570
after cutting like 12 pounds.
Yeah.
Like I was just,

993
00:57:58.600 --> 00:58:03.430
I couldn't keep water in like I was taking pedialyte and stuff like that as
well.

994
00:58:03.850 --> 00:58:07.690
And he works at dolce now.
However I do it the smart way,

995
00:58:08.110 --> 00:58:11.290
but back then like we'll just do whatever,
iterate in anything.

996
00:58:11.291 --> 00:58:12.580
Like I just couldn't,

997
00:58:12.610 --> 00:58:15.400
I didn't even eat that night because I couldn't hold anything in.

998
00:58:15.401 --> 00:58:18.940
My stomach just went in such at like stage that I was just like,

999
00:58:19.300 --> 00:58:20.740
love you compared methods.

1000
00:58:20.741 --> 00:58:24.400
Like if you guys talked to Lockhart and different cars and see how everybody

1001
00:58:24.401 --> 00:58:27.400
does it.
Does everybody do it the same way?
No.
No.

1002
00:58:27.490 --> 00:58:30.760
Not Everybody's doing it the same way Mo.
Most people are using a probiotic,

1003
00:58:30.910 --> 00:58:33.080
right?
Probiotics rehydrate,

1004
00:58:33.210 --> 00:58:36.810
no two to get your stomach ready to start digesting food again and,

1005
00:58:36.811 --> 00:58:39.700
and all of that.
So what probiotic do they use?

1006
00:58:39.820 --> 00:58:44.500
It depends on who's sponsoring them,
you know?
Um,
so for us right now,
you know,

1007
00:58:44.501 --> 00:58:47.860
we're using Mike stuff.
Mike's been tremendous to the team through the years.

1008
00:58:47.860 --> 00:58:52.120
It's all natural.
I mean,
you know,
his rehydration drink is water,
Himalayan salt,

1009
00:58:52.121 --> 00:58:54.550
honey,
you know,
blah,
blah blah.
I'm not going to put it out there,

1010
00:58:54.551 --> 00:58:58.930
but it's all natural stuff and it's all stuff that you're taking during,

1011
00:58:59.050 --> 00:58:59.980
you know,
you're like,

1012
00:58:59.981 --> 00:59:03.280
I'm always having Chia seeds and they million salt and honey.

1013
00:59:04.380 --> 00:59:08.010
I like Lockhart,
but literally,
I know that,
you know,

1014
00:59:08.050 --> 00:59:12.400
he worked with Dustin and there were three different shaped bottles that Dustin

1015
00:59:12.401 --> 00:59:17.320
had to consume,
which Dustin Ortiz before his last fight,
the head kick,

1016
00:59:17.330 --> 00:59:19.960
you got to let everybody know there's million people,
million Dentons yes,

1017
00:59:19.961 --> 00:59:21.980
that's an Ortiz Ortiz.
Uh,

1018
00:59:21.981 --> 00:59:26.090
and he had three different shaped bottles and each one had different ingredients

1019
00:59:26.091 --> 00:59:27.860
to be taken at different times.

1020
00:59:27.861 --> 00:59:30.200
And it was just really hard for Dustin and keep track of all that.

1021
00:59:30.230 --> 00:59:32.870
Is there science behind that though?
That I don't know.

1022
00:59:32.871 --> 00:59:36.200
I don't know enough about what,
what Georgia's doing.
Yeah.
I mean I,

1023
00:59:36.830 --> 00:59:39.110
I get that it would be hard to keep track of it,

1024
00:59:39.111 --> 00:59:42.440
but if there's a tangible benefit to keeping track of those three different

1025
00:59:42.441 --> 00:59:44.390
things.
Yeah.
For me,

1026
00:59:44.391 --> 00:59:48.350
the natural method that dolce uses is what I'll use if,

1027
00:59:48.410 --> 00:59:52.760
if a fighter is not paying hydration drink and you make so much of it,

1028
00:59:52.761 --> 00:59:57.050
like a gallon or whatever and you're only absorbing chia seeds.

1029
00:59:57.080 --> 01:00:00.070
Pink Himalayan salt,
Lemon Pink Himalayan salt.

1030
01:00:00.100 --> 01:00:04.490
When it said it sounded like you said Pinky mill and so no thank Himalayan salt

1031
01:00:05.670 --> 01:00:08.900
instead it again,
you should hear a basketballer you sheer mass for PAC worked.

1032
01:00:08.930 --> 01:00:12.260
I have.
Can we do [inaudible] at your Spanish?

1033
01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:16.910
I've only been speaking English for what,
like 12 years.
Come on man.
No big deal.

1034
01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:20.360
Coach,
can we do packet work tonight?
Sure.

1035
01:00:22.300 --> 01:00:27.200
So I'm sorry.
Uh,
Chia seeds.
Pink Himalayan salt.
Lemon.
Lemon.
Honey.

1036
01:00:27.230 --> 01:00:30.020
Why honey?
What does the honey for?
I don't know the pros buying.

1037
01:00:30.021 --> 01:00:32.990
I just put it tastes good.
It definitely tastes good.
Yeah.

1038
01:00:33.010 --> 01:00:35.740
You're going to take some of the sting off of the salt and uh,

1039
01:00:35.930 --> 01:00:40.880
just for a little bit of the,
the,
the carb and the sugar.
So right off the scale,

1040
01:00:40.881 --> 01:00:45.881
you take 16 ounces of the drink with some fruit and then you wait 50 minutes.

1041
01:00:45.921 --> 01:00:50.921
So you're absorbing all the nutrients versus like drinking or eating too much,

1042
01:00:51.800 --> 01:00:54.590
which is why,
oh,
it used to probably one,
which right away,

1043
01:00:54.610 --> 01:00:57.540
which is probably what happened.
That was,
I was uh,

1044
01:00:57.570 --> 01:00:59.660
I was a fucking mad scientist at that time.
I'm like,

1045
01:00:59.661 --> 01:01:04.090
Oh okay we're going to take a little bit in this creatine and nice because you

1046
01:01:04.091 --> 01:01:05.690
know,
every ounce of carbs,
you know,

1047
01:01:05.691 --> 01:01:07.790
you're going to hold three ounces of water and create teams going to make

1048
01:01:07.820 --> 01:01:11.030
[inaudible] as creating help.
You rehydrate.

1049
01:01:11.210 --> 01:01:15.860
Cause it does make you retain water.
Right.
But if you're not taking creatine,

1050
01:01:15.861 --> 01:01:20.090
normally you know it,
it's going to be.
But again,
at the time,

1051
01:01:20.210 --> 01:01:22.110
early on in my career,
you know,

1052
01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:26.900
a lot of everything that I've done from hand wrapping to conditioning to a

1053
01:01:26.930 --> 01:01:30.020
hydration,
it,
it's all learn as you go.

1054
01:01:30.050 --> 01:01:33.260
Creating does make you stronger.
It really does work,

1055
01:01:33.380 --> 01:01:34.820
but it also makes you face fat.

1056
01:01:37.490 --> 01:01:41.420
Definitely makes you,
if you just put more mass about it,

1057
01:01:42.180 --> 01:01:46.520
winter coat on creatine monohydrate.
And as far as like Cree,

1058
01:01:46.521 --> 01:01:50.450
alkaline and all these are the creatine monohydrate is one of the only proven

1059
01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:55.650
supplements legally that can make you stronger then.

1060
01:01:55.670 --> 01:01:58.850
But again,
whether or not it's good for you,
you know,
science says whatever.

1061
01:01:58.851 --> 01:02:02.780
But at the time I think it is good for you.
That's actually,
I believe it is.

1062
01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:07.590
And it's actually been proven to actually have a Jamie Google a creatine

1063
01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:12.640
nootropic benefits because I feel like I remember reading that they're,

1064
01:02:12.681 --> 01:02:13.100
um,

1065
01:02:13.100 --> 01:02:17.720
they're actually finding that there's some cognitive benefit to taking creatine

1066
01:02:18.060 --> 01:02:20.230
team.
No,
actually

1067
01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:23.400
<v 2>I read this and read the same thing and more water.
Absolutely.</v>

1068
01:02:23.401 --> 01:02:26.250
Your brain would function better because you know how it is when you're

1069
01:02:26.251 --> 01:02:28.590
dehydrated.
You can't fucking remember shit,

1070
01:02:29.010 --> 01:02:31.500
my brain's useless when I'm dehydrated.

1071
01:02:31.910 --> 01:02:35.310
We'll think about cutting 12 pounds of ice to do it here.

1072
01:02:35.380 --> 01:02:39.990
The old taekwondo days and fight the same day and no heat,
no re hydration,

1073
01:02:39.991 --> 01:02:41.130
didn't know what I was doing.

1074
01:02:41.370 --> 01:02:46.320
And when I went from one 40 to one 54 that's when I got good.
When I,

1075
01:02:46.380 --> 01:02:49.990
when I stopped cutting all the weight before that I was just a Zombie.
It's,

1076
01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:53.280
I see it in these guys.
I see these guys show up at the,

1077
01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:57.140
the way in and I see their sunken eyes.
They're sunk in cheek and it,

1078
01:02:57.360 --> 01:02:58.380
it makes me sick man.

1079
01:02:58.381 --> 01:03:02.280
Which is why I constantly harp on this fucking one FC thing,
you know?

1080
01:03:02.280 --> 01:03:05.910
And I talked to the UFC guys,
I talked to him a couple times.
So it was like,
look,

1081
01:03:05.940 --> 01:03:09.860
you guys have implemented this unbelievable innovative and,
and,

1082
01:03:09.870 --> 01:03:14.460
and really just fantastic strategy for cutting out all the steroid use.

1083
01:03:14.790 --> 01:03:18.900
I mean,
what you guys done is amazing.
It's so progressive.
You're on top of it.

1084
01:03:18.901 --> 01:03:22.110
You're ahead of everybody and you're really setting the standard to that shit

1085
01:03:22.111 --> 01:03:26.010
with weight cutting.
They should do that shit with weight cutting Ti.
Don't,

1086
01:03:26.011 --> 01:03:30.600
don't blow up your champions.
Move them,
move them.
Move them to just decide.

1087
01:03:31.230 --> 01:03:34.830
You have real champions.
Eight reasons.
Creatines the best nootropic there it is.

1088
01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:36.180
Creatine is a molecule.

1089
01:03:36.181 --> 01:03:40.260
Allow cells to store energy in your brain cells for use at another time.

1090
01:03:40.290 --> 01:03:43.740
This extra energy means you could do more work or study more effectively.

1091
01:03:43.741 --> 01:03:46.710
Unlike caffeine,
you don't feel like you have more energy.
I'll,

1092
01:03:46.780 --> 01:03:50.700
this is not a science journal.
What is this?
Like someone's blog or some shit,

1093
01:03:50.810 --> 01:03:54.780
but negates symptoms of sleep deprivation.
Oh Shit.

1094
01:03:55.740 --> 01:03:59.520
I need some of that sometimes too.
I just got back from Thailand.

1095
01:03:59.550 --> 01:04:03.180
I was in Thailand for nine days and I've been back for a week and I still wake

1096
01:04:03.181 --> 01:04:07.440
up after sleeping for two hours and I'm like,
what the fuck?
Why am I awake?

1097
01:04:07.441 --> 01:04:10.770
And then I go downstairs,
I'll eat,
I'll watch TV.
And I'm like,
I'll just,

1098
01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:14.910
might as well just work out.
I'm wide awake.
And then an hour later exhausted.

1099
01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:18.060
Can't,
can't wait to go to sleep,
go to sleep for more hours.

1100
01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:21.610
The train at all out of there.
No,
I have a meniscus tear.

1101
01:04:21.620 --> 01:04:23.190
I was just there with my family for a vacation.

1102
01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:25.620
But I would say very fascinating thing that happened to me.

1103
01:04:25.830 --> 01:04:30.260
I had a meniscus tear,
small meniscus tear and a,
I went running on it.

1104
01:04:30.260 --> 01:04:32.550
I was doing yoga on it and it was seemed to be fine.

1105
01:04:32.551 --> 01:04:35.280
Then I ran on it because it seemed like it was just kind of like,

1106
01:04:35.550 --> 01:04:38.710
like my knee was just a little sore and then after I ran on it,

1107
01:04:38.740 --> 01:04:41.850
it locked up on me like it was really tight.
So I said,
fuck,

1108
01:04:41.851 --> 01:04:46.620
I got to go get an MRI.
So I get an MRI.
They say,
yeah,
you've got a meniscus tear.

1109
01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:51.260
Um,
you can get him in this copy.
Is that what they say at Mississippi?
Whatever,

1110
01:04:51.330 --> 01:04:51.780
whatever,

1111
01:04:51.780 --> 01:04:56.780
when the operation or we could try exosomes exosomes,

1112
01:04:57.661 --> 01:05:01.590
which is a,
it's an ass Google exosomes.

1113
01:05:01.620 --> 01:05:04.330
So we can explain it in a technical way.
But I,

1114
01:05:04.331 --> 01:05:08.160
I had some of that shot into my shoulder with miraculous results.

1115
01:05:08.490 --> 01:05:10.950
I mean I've had a bunch of different things done to my shoulder and then I

1116
01:05:10.951 --> 01:05:15.240
always wind up reinjuring it partially.
And then I'll get more stem cells.

1117
01:05:15.540 --> 01:05:19.630
This had by far the greatest benefit of anything I've ever done.
Well.

1118
01:05:19.690 --> 01:05:21.430
So I get it shot into my knee.

1119
01:05:22.060 --> 01:05:25.060
When I say within two weeks I had no pain.

1120
01:05:25.180 --> 01:05:29.920
I mean fucking nothing like deep squats.
No problem.

1121
01:05:30.010 --> 01:05:31.510
Not Bothering me at all.

1122
01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:35.770
And I was doing no only bodyweight stuff for like six weeks.

1123
01:05:36.330 --> 01:05:40.240
I need it.
I need to know about it.
I'm telling you from my wife,

1124
01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:44.770
she was my test dummy file.
Incredible with this has done,

1125
01:05:45.070 --> 01:05:49.300
I ran yesterday,
ran in the hills for the first time in six weeks.
Zero pain,

1126
01:05:49.301 --> 01:05:52.930
zero discomfort.
I was,
I woke up this morning say fuck,
you better not be stiff.

1127
01:05:53.020 --> 01:05:57.160
I don't feel it man.
It feels like there's nothing there that's impressive.

1128
01:05:57.220 --> 01:06:00.670
Regenerative medicine.
What they're doing with Tj Dillashaw had done,

1129
01:06:00.910 --> 01:06:04.670
Tj Dillashaw went down to Panama on two separate occasions to uh,

1130
01:06:04.780 --> 01:06:08.230
work with Doctor Neil Riordan.
Who is doing that in Panama.
Well,

1131
01:06:08.231 --> 01:06:10.360
they're also doing similar things right now.

1132
01:06:10.361 --> 01:06:14.560
They're able to do that in Santa Monica,
but under some sort of a test thing.

1133
01:06:14.561 --> 01:06:18.490
They're doing like test study to see how their stuff works.
But it,

1134
01:06:18.491 --> 01:06:20.880
they do it with PRP as well.
So they,

1135
01:06:20.881 --> 01:06:25.881
they put exosomes in your body and they inject it with PRP and the PRP and the

1136
01:06:27.101 --> 01:06:30.190
exosomes work together and regenerate tissue.

1137
01:06:30.580 --> 01:06:34.660
It's radical shit man.
I mean it's used to have a meniscus tear.

1138
01:06:34.780 --> 01:06:37.120
Your knee was fucked up for months and it was,

1139
01:06:37.150 --> 01:06:40.900
if it was so stiff that you couldn't walk without a limp is not going to get

1140
01:06:40.901 --> 01:06:45.370
better in a week.
This shit was better in a week and two weeks there was zero,

1141
01:06:45.820 --> 01:06:48.490
zero even recognition that there was anything wrong.

1142
01:06:48.491 --> 01:06:50.680
It didn't feel like there was anything wrong.
Well that is crazy.

1143
01:06:50.800 --> 01:06:53.800
It's fucking nuts man.
And this is,
you know,

1144
01:06:53.801 --> 01:06:57.910
here we are in 2018 2028 they're going to grow you a new fucking leg

1145
01:07:00.040 --> 01:07:02.020
really close to some crazy shit.

1146
01:07:02.380 --> 01:07:07.240
Do you know they're repairing completely torn ACL is now instead of replacing

1147
01:07:07.241 --> 01:07:09.700
them your ACL snaps,

1148
01:07:09.970 --> 01:07:13.630
they've figured out a way to repair them where they got someone back to the u s

1149
01:07:13.631 --> 01:07:18.250
bobsled team four months after the operation.
That's crazy.

1150
01:07:18.370 --> 01:07:20.140
Fucking crazy.

1151
01:07:20.440 --> 01:07:25.000
They've got guys doing box jumps for months after complete ACL tear.

1152
01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:31.360
My wife competed at the crossfit games four months after ACL replacement.

1153
01:07:32.380 --> 01:07:37.220
How'd she do that?
Doctor Mauri Harwood and uh,
uh,

1154
01:07:37.300 --> 01:07:42.300
lowest closeup possible.
But the,
the ACO would not have been reformed by the APP.

1155
01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:45.150
No,
she had no,
she had it replaced.
Right.

1156
01:07:45.490 --> 01:07:48.490
But the cadaver graft to understand it's just a scaffolding.
Understood.

1157
01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:52.150
Understood.
So it wouldn't have been fully formed by then.
Well,
the way we'll see,

1158
01:07:52.151 --> 01:07:55.060
here's the thing,
it's the way,
the way crossfit works.
This is not an impact.

1159
01:07:55.061 --> 01:07:59.170
It's not a contact sport.
Right.
So surgery in October,

1160
01:07:59.290 --> 01:08:02.980
she was competing again in February,
rights in November,
December,
January,

1161
01:08:02.980 --> 01:08:05.590
February.
And then by the time the games rolled around in July,

1162
01:08:05.830 --> 01:08:09.250
she was now at like that eight month mark.
So that was yours.
Okay.

1163
01:08:09.251 --> 01:08:12.100
They say six months is when it's really pretty much healed.

1164
01:08:12.500 --> 01:08:16.160
But she was in the gym the next day.
Right.
It's like literally you have ACL

1165
01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:19.310
<v 0>surgery.
Well,
I fall.
Your Wife,
Jessica.</v>

1166
01:08:20.910 --> 01:08:25.850
Jessica is married to a maniac.
I made,
I made her a maniac when I met her.

1167
01:08:25.851 --> 01:08:29.600
She was at when,
I bet she did.
A lot of it are so when I know when I met her,

1168
01:08:29.601 --> 01:08:32.420
she was a hippie and she was an actress.
Seriously.

1169
01:08:33.320 --> 01:08:37.580
That the level of maniac that she has.
They nobody making that.
No,
no,
no,

1170
01:08:37.581 --> 01:08:40.990
that's true.
It's definitely let us know.

1171
01:08:42.140 --> 01:08:45.170
But yeah,
there's a fucking room that's always been there filled with crazy.

1172
01:08:45.260 --> 01:08:47.630
Oh No,
she's,
she's uh,
she's amazing.

1173
01:08:47.660 --> 01:08:52.660
43 she doing her first figure competition now she took the year off of figure.

1174
01:08:53.780 --> 01:08:57.410
What does that it goes bodybuilding type of deal.
Yeah.
She's never done it.

1175
01:08:57.440 --> 01:09:01.160
So she,
she set like a bunch of powerlifting records.

1176
01:09:01.430 --> 01:09:05.180
She went to the Games twice.
She fought,
she was on the US hockey team.

1177
01:09:05.980 --> 01:09:10.130
Um,
and now she's going to a finger comp and then,
you know,
she's,
she's crazy.

1178
01:09:10.131 --> 01:09:13.740
She's mom.
Wow.
His mom.
It's your mom.

1179
01:09:13.750 --> 01:09:17.570
And I don't know if you saw that picture that I posted from my last kickbox and

1180
01:09:17.571 --> 01:09:18.404
fight it,
but it was uh,

1181
01:09:18.620 --> 01:09:21.680
it was carrying in the corner and it was Jessica right there holding the eyes.

1182
01:09:21.681 --> 01:09:22.720
I was like an amazing mason pictures.

1183
01:09:22.910 --> 01:09:27.910
It's amazing that she could start training that hard four months later because a

1184
01:09:28.191 --> 01:09:29.150
lot of people will,

1185
01:09:29.151 --> 01:09:33.110
especially the real issue with fighters is the lateral movement.
Yeah.

1186
01:09:33.260 --> 01:09:35.990
It's all the footwork and the movement and that's when they always wind up

1187
01:09:35.991 --> 01:09:37.970
blowing their knee out.
Like so many guys.

1188
01:09:38.270 --> 01:09:42.690
I told my mcls here completely two weeks before is I'm a Davis.
She is,
yeah,

1189
01:09:43.090 --> 01:09:48.020
Yup.
Yeah,
absolutely.
But she,
so like,
but most people,
like you said,

1190
01:09:48.021 --> 01:09:48.590
she's a maniac.

1191
01:09:48.590 --> 01:09:51.620
Most people aren't like her when they give you that range of motion machine,

1192
01:09:51.621 --> 01:09:54.860
the day after surgery,
they say you should be in this five hours a day.

1193
01:09:55.280 --> 01:09:58.040
She's in it five hours a day every day.

1194
01:09:58.550 --> 01:10:01.910
And she was in the gym the next day rowing with her legs straight.

1195
01:10:01.970 --> 01:10:02.820
I mean there's just a,

1196
01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:08.200
there's a level of just dedication and commitment to rehab at that she had,

1197
01:10:09.740 --> 01:10:13.340
when I tore my ACL,
I have a steam room in my house and uh,

1198
01:10:13.520 --> 01:10:16.490
I would just get in there every day in too deep squats and the steam room and

1199
01:10:16.491 --> 01:10:18.980
just through the pain.
But because of that,

1200
01:10:18.981 --> 01:10:22.400
I never had an issue with any range of motion whatsoever where I've had two

1201
01:10:22.401 --> 01:10:27.230
friends that have had ACL operations was in the past year that had to go back

1202
01:10:27.231 --> 01:10:31.290
and go under and get manipulated because they didn't have range emotion.
Wow.

1203
01:10:31.370 --> 01:10:32.960
So they,
they take you,

1204
01:10:32.990 --> 01:10:37.130
put you out and just take your name like crap because you just can't handle the

1205
01:10:37.131 --> 01:10:40.490
pain.
Right.
That's all it is.
But in my opinion,

1206
01:10:40.700 --> 01:10:45.500
take that pain early so that body,
it never has a chance to lock up and,

1207
01:10:45.501 --> 01:10:49.670
and all that scar tissue developed.
Just break that shit down real early.
Yeah.

1208
01:10:49.730 --> 01:10:52.660
Well I was,
like I said,
I tore my MCL completed,

1209
01:10:52.661 --> 01:10:56.630
gone off the top of the bone last year,
five weeks before my MMA fight.

1210
01:10:56.920 --> 01:11:00.370
MMA debut,
five weeks,
tore it off the bone.
Yeah,

1211
01:11:00.590 --> 01:11:04.010
it was like I go in and the doctor's like,
listen man,
I don't want to scare you,

1212
01:11:04.011 --> 01:11:06.620
but it's probably the worst MCL injury I've ever seen.
Oh,

1213
01:11:06.621 --> 01:11:11.410
you don't want to scare me.
Shout out to Dr Donnelly.

1214
01:11:12.370 --> 01:11:14.130
Uh,
but it's

1215
01:11:14.130 --> 01:11:18.900
<v 4>gone.
It's going to hurt.
But you know it's gone.
So what does it gain?
It's gone.</v>

1216
01:11:19.010 --> 01:11:21.790
[inaudible] is gone.
That you can start,
you can start training.
The can start.

1217
01:11:22.350 --> 01:11:25.130
He's like,
this is the way he explains like listen,
like I,

1218
01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:28.470
you might not be able to find him five weeks out on,
no,
I'm not sure.
You don't,

1219
01:11:28.620 --> 01:11:30.510
I wouldn't recommend surgery because you're an athlete.

1220
01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:34.260
You would recommend surgery because you're an athlete.
That's what he said.

1221
01:11:34.290 --> 01:11:37.080
What does that mean?
I don't know.
He's like,
you should,
you should start doing PT.

1222
01:11:37.670 --> 01:11:41.580
Uh,
normally I don't recommend this to like until two weeks after the injury,

1223
01:11:41.581 --> 01:11:44.520
but he didn't explain why he wouldn't recommend surgery because you're an

1224
01:11:44.521 --> 01:11:48.780
athlete and they will put me out for six months,
but it will heal it 100%.

1225
01:11:48.781 --> 01:11:53.560
Is that the idea is you're an active addict?
No.
What?

1226
01:11:53.580 --> 01:11:57.620
He's leaving out as he had so much stability already.
Did the ice.

1227
01:11:57.670 --> 01:12:00.270
He said it was like he's a 48 hours later.

1228
01:12:00.300 --> 01:12:03.960
It looks pretty good considering Utah completely off the boat he was,

1229
01:12:04.050 --> 01:12:07.740
other than the MRI,
you wouldn't know that the MCL was gone.
Okay.

1230
01:12:07.741 --> 01:12:11.310
So now when it's torn off the bone,
explain what happens.
Can you,

1231
01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:15.510
so it was on top of the bone.
So the MCL is,
um,

1232
01:12:15.720 --> 01:12:18.790
the outside or is it the Ltl?
Inside.
Inside.
Inside.

1233
01:12:18.810 --> 01:12:22.950
And so it's on the inside and it's separated from the bone.

1234
01:12:22.951 --> 01:12:27.660
So how's it heal?
How To heal?
It was,
he said,
well he's,
well,

1235
01:12:27.661 --> 01:12:31.630
he said is because it's on top of the bone that you have merchants and much
less.

1236
01:12:32.730 --> 01:12:36.780
Yeah.
So there's the MCL.
So at tour off the bone,

1237
01:12:37.350 --> 01:12:41.940
right on the top,
he said,
Huh.
So ripped off completely.
Yeah.

1238
01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:45.420
The whole thing.
Grappling.
Yeah.
Gone.
So the whole thing's gone.
Yeah.

1239
01:12:45.450 --> 01:12:50.320
So it was no MCL?
Nope.
So you don't have an MCL right now?
No,
I don't know.

1240
01:12:50.321 --> 01:12:54.860
I,
I'm fine now.
He just don't know.
He doesn't have it.
Mcl.
Right.

1241
01:12:55.050 --> 01:12:59.370
So,
but all the other stuff and the muscles keep it intact.
Yeah,
absolutely.

1242
01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:03.810
So what he said is,
man,
but did you think that like for long term stability,

1243
01:13:03.811 --> 01:13:07.440
the long for your longterm career probably be a good idea to have an MCL?

1244
01:13:07.520 --> 01:13:07.840
I'm not,

1245
01:13:07.840 --> 01:13:10.740
I haven't had a problem with him and I fought three different comments for us.

1246
01:13:11.810 --> 01:13:14.670
It hasn't bothered me.
If I was,
I was running,

1247
01:13:14.700 --> 01:13:18.780
doing full sprints two and a half weeks later after it happened.
Wow.
Which was,

1248
01:13:18.781 --> 01:13:22.470
he was like,
he saw me walk in and say,
where's your base man?
I was like,
oh,

1249
01:13:22.471 --> 01:13:25.530
it's in the car.
I don't need it anymore.
It hurts.
It kind of pinches,

1250
01:13:25.740 --> 01:13:27.930
pinches the knee.
He's like,
what do you mean?
I was like,
oh,

1251
01:13:27.931 --> 01:13:32.100
I just got cleared to run.
So he,
he told me I ran it to happen.
It's like,
listen,

1252
01:13:32.101 --> 01:13:34.740
like I told them the situation,
I was like,
I have a fight.

1253
01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:36.870
I have a fight in five weeks.
I need to get ready for it.

1254
01:13:37.290 --> 01:13:40.740
It's my debut is a big thing.
It's in my,
it's my MMA debut was a big thing.

1255
01:13:41.550 --> 01:13:42.690
It's like,
I dunno man,

1256
01:13:42.750 --> 01:13:45.410
like it's Kinda your call on this one that you might be able to fight.

1257
01:13:45.411 --> 01:13:48.150
You might like see how you feel type of thing.
I'll,
I'll,

1258
01:13:48.260 --> 01:13:51.090
I'll allow you to do PT starting tomorrow.
So what I did,

1259
01:13:51.091 --> 01:13:54.240
I was doing PT and that was doing cryotherapy twice a day,
every day.

1260
01:13:54.780 --> 01:13:57.660
So I was keeping the swine down and trying to strengthen the leg at the same

1261
01:13:57.661 --> 01:14:01.980
time.
But you that MCL,
it's not a partial tear.
It's a full tail gone.

1262
01:14:02.580 --> 01:14:05.880
He told him,
he's like,
there's nothing you can do about it.
It's gone.

1263
01:14:06.060 --> 01:14:10.350
It's going to hurt to hear it.
This right here.
Yeah.
So it's a grade three tear.

1264
01:14:10.380 --> 01:14:11.213
Yeah.
Yeah.

1265
01:14:12.250 --> 01:14:15.280
<v 0>Gone.
Gone.
So you don't have that thing.
Yeah.</v>

1266
01:14:15.670 --> 01:14:19.840
And they probably can't even replace it at this point unless there's some sort

1267
01:14:19.841 --> 01:14:22.580
of a cadaver one and then you'd be out for six months.
Yeah.

1268
01:14:22.830 --> 01:14:25.600
And he fought five times since you fuck everything about that Bro.

1269
01:14:27.670 --> 01:14:29.940
He was like,
he did to this days.
I you,

1270
01:14:30.130 --> 01:14:33.950
you changed my perception and mcls completely cause he hasn't,

1271
01:14:33.960 --> 01:14:36.130
he didn't believe it when I tell him I can run now.

1272
01:14:36.280 --> 01:14:38.340
Does he ever work with athletes?
I told him,

1273
01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:40.480
he told me he used to be that his doctor.
That's all he does.

1274
01:14:40.500 --> 01:14:44.710
He focuses on how does he,
that seems so crazy.
Maybe of an unusual knee.

1275
01:14:44.950 --> 01:14:48.280
I don't know.
I just,
I just ate a lot of Maca powder.

1276
01:14:48.350 --> 01:14:52.720
Peruvian mind is that Maca powder and that cup of calm about it and that was it.

1277
01:14:52.890 --> 01:14:56.250
That that is insane.
You know,
you don't need that.
I committed.

1278
01:14:56.290 --> 01:15:00.070
I committed a law to my,
to my rehab though.
I was,
like I said,

1279
01:15:00.071 --> 01:15:01.990
I was doing twice a day doing cryotherapy,

1280
01:15:01.991 --> 01:15:05.510
ice and they're trying to do everything I possibly could to fight.
I'll,

1281
01:15:05.560 --> 01:15:09.040
I'll also say that,
you know,
you get a lot of bad raps,
you know,

1282
01:15:09.041 --> 01:15:12.940
with crossfit and listen,
it doesn't matter what it is.
It could be spin,

1283
01:15:12.941 --> 01:15:16.960
it could be crossfit,
it can be taekwondo,
it does it.
There's good crossfit,

1284
01:15:16.961 --> 01:15:19.570
there's bad crossfit,
there's good taekwondo,
there's bad taekwondo.

1285
01:15:19.990 --> 01:15:24.910
At the end of the day,
this kid had been doing,
uh,
you know,
physical,

1286
01:15:24.911 --> 01:15:28.780
general,
physical preparedness for years.
He's in phenomenal shape.

1287
01:15:28.810 --> 01:15:33.530
Everything that he does,
uh,
you know,
the stability in his legs.
Like I gave him a,

1288
01:15:33.670 --> 01:15:37.120
I gave him a stability test after he hurt his knee and I couldn't,
I'm like,

1289
01:15:37.180 --> 01:15:39.700
I think it's still there.
I said,
go get an MRI,
be sure.

1290
01:15:39.701 --> 01:15:44.701
But there was no movement in his leg whatsoever because he's so strong.

1291
01:15:45.550 --> 01:15:48.460
That's pretty crazy and pretty fortunate.
Right?
Yeah.
And I was lucky.

1292
01:15:48.730 --> 01:15:51.800
It was definitely like he still doesn't believe it to this day that it happened.

1293
01:15:54.250 --> 01:15:57.290
So what else do you do in terms of like a recuperative,

1294
01:15:57.320 --> 01:16:00.340
you said you did cryotherapy.
Do you do sauna work at all?

1295
01:16:00.850 --> 01:16:05.020
I liked the infrared sauna.
Yeah.
But that,
I just started doing that recently.

1296
01:16:05.021 --> 01:16:06.700
I was just doing a lot of the cryotherapy.

1297
01:16:06.760 --> 01:16:08.950
I don't know if there's any benefit to infrared.
Is there,

1298
01:16:08.980 --> 01:16:12.640
do you know your body needs to heat up?
That's all it is.

1299
01:16:12.641 --> 01:16:17.350
Is there a benefit to using infrared as opposed to a regular sauna?
Eh,
again,

1300
01:16:17.351 --> 01:16:21.130
I mean there are 10,000 people that were probably screaming that we gave Korea

1301
01:16:21.131 --> 01:16:22.300
Tina a shot out.

1302
01:16:22.330 --> 01:16:25.390
And I'm sure there are people that are going to say infrared is benefit and

1303
01:16:25.391 --> 01:16:29.620
infrared kills you.
Um,
but I do believe that,
you know,
again,
hot,

1304
01:16:29.621 --> 01:16:33.160
cold therapy works and you're getting your body hot and you know,

1305
01:16:33.161 --> 01:16:34.590
getting your body cool and,

1306
01:16:34.640 --> 01:16:38.790
and manipulating your metabolism a is something that uh,

1307
01:16:39.030 --> 01:16:40.840
needs to be done and should be done.
Yeah,

1308
01:16:40.841 --> 01:16:44.620
well it's heat shock proteins and cold shock proteins that reduce inflammation.

1309
01:16:44.870 --> 01:16:48.580
And there's a lot of studies on that board in the more interesting studies is on

1310
01:16:48.880 --> 01:16:53.880
sauna use and the fact that this reduction of inflammation has led to a 40%

1311
01:16:55.691 --> 01:16:57.910
reduction in overall cause.

1312
01:16:57.911 --> 01:17:01.750
Mortality Meaning in awe on all cause mortality.

1313
01:17:01.751 --> 01:17:04.300
Mortality Means Strokes,
heart attacks,
cancer,

1314
01:17:04.480 --> 01:17:06.820
40% reduction over long,

1315
01:17:06.910 --> 01:17:10.280
long study that they did and I think were doing it four times

1316
01:17:10.280 --> 01:17:13.790
<v 2>a week for 20 minutes a day.
What's fucking crazy?</v>

1317
01:17:13.820 --> 01:17:18.440
But if that reduction of inflammation,
inflammation is the number one enemy,

1318
01:17:18.441 --> 01:17:22.550
it's the enemy of your health.
It's the cause of so many diseases.

1319
01:17:22.551 --> 01:17:25.940
And ailments and,
and if you can do something to mitigate that,

1320
01:17:25.941 --> 01:17:29.360
whether it's a cryotherapy or sauna work,

1321
01:17:29.780 --> 01:17:34.190
and then cryotherapy gets a bad rap too.
Cause there's a lot of unfounded claims,

1322
01:17:34.191 --> 01:17:35.100
you know,
you,

1323
01:17:35.180 --> 01:17:39.170
you'd go to some of those more unscrupulous cryotherapy websites and you know,

1324
01:17:39.240 --> 01:17:42.260
they're basically making shit up.
They bash it.
Well,

1325
01:17:42.261 --> 01:17:45.290
I mean the ones that are talking good about it,
the ones that are selling it,

1326
01:17:45.440 --> 01:17:48.410
they're talking about how much fat you lose and all this different stuff.
Like,

1327
01:17:48.411 --> 01:17:52.400
look,
it reduces inflammation.
It's what it does.
It's really good for that.

1328
01:17:52.430 --> 01:17:56.240
You know,
good afternoon.
Yeah.
Well if you're training on a regular basis,

1329
01:17:56.241 --> 01:17:59.240
you're an athlete,
that inflammation can be detrimental.

1330
01:17:59.241 --> 01:18:00.290
And that's just all it is.

1331
01:18:00.440 --> 01:18:04.790
The more that you can do and do it in all these different ways with diet and

1332
01:18:04.820 --> 01:18:07.560
exercise and sleep and all these different,
you're,

1333
01:18:07.561 --> 01:18:08.990
you're it all they all compound

1334
01:18:09.480 --> 01:18:13.960
<v 3>for,
for,
for me,
my,
my philosophy with the Jim has always been,
and again,</v>

1335
01:18:13.961 --> 01:18:17.460
it's very basic and of course there's something like,
you know,
overtraining,

1336
01:18:17.470 --> 01:18:20.760
but you know,
no such thing as overtraining.
Just talking to recovery.
Know.

1337
01:18:20.950 --> 01:18:24.460
So we trained really hard.
Everybody's doing two,
three a days.

1338
01:18:24.461 --> 01:18:28.720
We do a lot of road work.
We do a lot of strength conditioning.
Um,
you know,

1339
01:18:29.230 --> 01:18:33.340
we don't get tired in fights,
but,
you know,
sleeping is important.
Uh,
you know,

1340
01:18:33.341 --> 01:18:35.680
recovery,
inflammation management,
uh,
you know,

1341
01:18:35.740 --> 01:18:37.960
everything along those lines has to be part of it.

1342
01:18:38.410 --> 01:18:41.370
Or you're gonna break your body down to a point where you can't perform to

1343
01:18:41.371 --> 01:18:46.300
fighters ever give you a hard time for being a little overweight.
No,
no,
nope.

1344
01:18:46.390 --> 01:18:51.100
Never,
never cast on you missing out.
Let me,
let me let,

1345
01:18:51.430 --> 01:18:55.100
well,
I don't want to,
I don't want to know pat word.

1346
01:18:56.780 --> 01:19:00.600
You hear that?
Um,
so no.
You know,

1347
01:19:00.770 --> 01:19:03.610
this is a guy who understands health,
wellness a hundred,
a hundred percent.

1348
01:19:03.611 --> 01:19:07.030
I'm the,
I'm the crossfit affiliate holder and I don't do crossfit.
I,

1349
01:19:07.420 --> 01:19:11.710
I'm a human heavy bag.
It's what I do is literally what I do.
I run a gym.

1350
01:19:11.860 --> 01:19:15.690
I get beat up for a living hope pass.
You know,
there's,

1351
01:19:15.780 --> 01:19:17.590
there's nobody that holds pat.
Like,

1352
01:19:17.591 --> 01:19:22.591
literally my day can be Kevin Ross gassed on Gina Carano Zoya for Asto Eddie

1353
01:19:22.721 --> 01:19:26.230
episode low Diego.
Yamice a little Stephanie who fucking,

1354
01:19:26.231 --> 01:19:30.760
it's harder at or as hard as Jenna,
my giant Kiwi,
uh,
you know,

1355
01:19:30.790 --> 01:19:35.590
and that's four hours of my life.
Every night my body's adapted to that.

1356
01:19:35.591 --> 01:19:39.130
I'll sweat like a pig.
I won't drop a pound.
Um,
I don't eat that much.

1357
01:19:39.190 --> 01:19:41.860
I probably don't eat enough.
I just,
I live my gym,

1358
01:19:41.950 --> 01:19:44.590
so absolutely I'm going to die of a heart attack or I'm going to get my shit

1359
01:19:44.591 --> 01:19:47.170
together.
Um,
you know,
I don't think I'm morbidly obese,

1360
01:19:47.171 --> 01:19:50.140
but I certainly don't look like a guy who knows about fitness,
but I do.

1361
01:19:50.420 --> 01:19:54.070
It's just you have to put yourself first.

1362
01:19:54.190 --> 01:19:58.870
And it's very difficult for me as a coach to put myself first.
I have to,

1363
01:19:59.140 --> 01:20:01.000
if there's time for me to work out,

1364
01:20:01.240 --> 01:20:03.190
there's time for me to get somebody else a fight.

1365
01:20:03.400 --> 01:20:07.710
If there's time for me not to be a diet thing,
there's no way he'll tell you,

1366
01:20:07.980 --> 01:20:12.180
<v 0>well,
what do you eat in the morning?
I'll have a shake,
uh,
in the afternoon.</v>

1367
01:20:12.210 --> 01:20:16.930
I'll have a meal and then I'll eat that meal though.

1368
01:20:16.931 --> 01:20:21.300
So no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
Like A,
like a prepaid meal,
like a,

1369
01:20:21.301 --> 01:20:25.080
an out of the cave meal,
his food sponsor.
It's,
it's,

1370
01:20:25.170 --> 01:20:28.740
it's a matter of probably not eating enough,
uh,

1371
01:20:29.220 --> 01:20:33.570
and not working out,
doing something that my body's not used to it.

1372
01:20:33.720 --> 01:20:38.460
I would be honest,
I would,
I live,
trust me,
I live with a physical specimen,

1373
01:20:38.490 --> 01:20:40.710
you know,
that knows everything I eat.
I don't,

1374
01:20:41.220 --> 01:20:45.810
I don't eat enough and I treat sense.
I'm telling you I,

1375
01:20:45.880 --> 01:20:48.600
that doesn't make any sense.
That'd be like,
look,
scientifically,

1376
01:20:48.601 --> 01:20:49.434
it doesn't make any sense.

1377
01:20:49.440 --> 01:20:54.240
I guarantee you I take in less than 2,500 calories a day.
Guarantee you,

1378
01:20:55.890 --> 01:21:00.780
you should go to the doctor.
I would need time for,
they'll have the time to go.

1379
01:21:00.820 --> 01:21:04.470
Doctor.
I live in my gym.
I don't,
and again,
it sounds like excuses,

1380
01:21:04.471 --> 01:21:07.770
but literally you could be a thyroid issue or something.
Could be me.

1381
01:21:07.771 --> 01:21:11.070
It seems like that's on TV because you're making it sound like I'm living a 600

1382
01:21:11.071 --> 01:21:13.720
pound life and it's not exactly the same.
I mean,

1383
01:21:13.740 --> 01:21:16.060
we're talking about health and wellness and you know,

1384
01:21:16.170 --> 01:21:20.780
this is the elephant in the room.
Not,
aw,
I saw dick

1385
01:21:23.560 --> 01:21:28.340
that's just saying no.
I mean,
because you are such a,

1386
01:21:28.400 --> 01:21:33.390
uh,
a talented coach and you know so much about health and fitness that,
you know,

1387
01:21:33.420 --> 01:21:36.600
that's theirs.
That's a thing.
Yeah,
absolutely.
100%,

1388
01:21:36.940 --> 01:21:41.940
100% for fighting.
I think it's Kevin.
Kevin will give me grief,
you know,

1389
01:21:41.941 --> 01:21:45.360
but he's really the only one that gets away with it.
Well,
Kevin's a Hummingbird,

1390
01:21:45.630 --> 01:21:49.530
right?
He can't keep weight on.
No,
exactly.
Exactly.

1391
01:21:49.860 --> 01:21:53.520
But no for so,
so for me it's just,
it's a matter of just making time and I just,

1392
01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.370
I don't make time for myself.
I just don't,
well,

1393
01:21:56.371 --> 01:22:00.410
that's probably why you're such a good coach to the obsession that a coach has.

1394
01:22:00.440 --> 01:22:02.100
It's,
it's such a different obsession.

1395
01:22:02.820 --> 01:22:06.030
The obsession that a coach has versus the obsession that a fighter has.
I mean,

1396
01:22:06.031 --> 01:22:09.970
it's a,
it's a completely different focus.
It's an outward focus instead of in,

1397
01:22:10.030 --> 01:22:12.120
in my,
in my model is,
is totally different.

1398
01:22:12.121 --> 01:22:13.350
I don't think we've ever talked about it.

1399
01:22:13.830 --> 01:22:17.310
I've never taken a dime from a professional fighter ever.

1400
01:22:18.270 --> 01:22:20.700
You don't get paid at all?
Nope.
How do you make,

1401
01:22:20.800 --> 01:22:23.650
so you make a living off the crossfit for the gym?
Not just the crossfit.

1402
01:22:23.730 --> 01:22:27.450
I have membership,
gym memberships.
That's it.
I've never in my entire life,

1403
01:22:27.630 --> 01:22:32.160
Alexis fought Ronda.
This kid's got 50 fights.
Kevin run down the list.

1404
01:22:32.161 --> 01:22:34.260
I've never taken a penny from a professional.

1405
01:22:34.261 --> 01:22:37.290
You have to be completely unique in that.
I mean,

1406
01:22:37.291 --> 01:22:40.920
I don't think there's anybody else.
I,
I don't,
I don't ever heard of that before.

1407
01:22:40.950 --> 01:22:41.260
No.

1408
01:22:41.260 --> 01:22:46.260
If it would be like for me it would be like if the Golden State Warriors paid

1409
01:22:47.251 --> 01:22:50.760
the coach directly,
uh,
who's,
who's running,

1410
01:22:50.761 --> 01:22:55.110
who's running the asylum,
then that's an interesting way to look at it.

1411
01:22:55.140 --> 01:23:00.090
I don't work for him.
I worked with him.
Right pad work,
travel,

1412
01:23:00.360 --> 01:23:04.170
like I won't even take per diem on fight week of the UFC.
I mean,

1413
01:23:04.290 --> 01:23:07.180
I'm going to take Lexuses fights twice a year.

1414
01:23:07.600 --> 01:23:11.120
She's got a kid and I'm going to take her per diem money.
Right.
It can't.
No.

1415
01:23:11.140 --> 01:23:15.250
I can't.
As a coach that really when I advise him,

1416
01:23:15.251 --> 01:23:18.430
this is a good fight for you,
this is a bad fight for you.
This,

1417
01:23:18.730 --> 01:23:23.620
it can't be motivated by me making money.
It just,
it for me.

1418
01:23:23.621 --> 01:23:28.480
I can't do that.
Well,
I know you put together this,
uh,
you,
you are,

1419
01:23:28.481 --> 01:23:31.600
you're really well known as not just being a coach,

1420
01:23:31.630 --> 01:23:34.640
but as training other coaches that,

1421
01:23:35.080 --> 01:23:38.260
that coaching seminar that you do,
you do it every year,
twice a year,

1422
01:23:38.320 --> 01:23:39.153
twice a year.

1423
01:23:39.760 --> 01:23:44.760
It is one of the most respected and appreciated seminar series and all of combat

1424
01:23:46.811 --> 01:23:49.030
sports because it's one of the things that's missing.

1425
01:23:49.060 --> 01:23:51.730
How do you run a gym correctly?
Absolutely.

1426
01:23:51.760 --> 01:23:56.500
The fact that you're willing to open up the door to all these other coaches and

1427
01:23:56.501 --> 01:24:00.040
potential competitors,
right?
And,
and let them do that.

1428
01:24:00.041 --> 01:24:03.370
It just speaks volumes about your approach and anybody,
anybody can come.

1429
01:24:03.371 --> 01:24:07.840
And so when I opened up and I started,
I didn't know what I was doing.
You know,

1430
01:24:07.870 --> 01:24:10.030
I was a fighter when I was younger.
Uh,

1431
01:24:10.031 --> 01:24:13.120
and then I had to get a real job when my wife got pregnant and I got into a

1432
01:24:13.121 --> 01:24:15.880
bunch of other stuff.
They didn't tell your protection and all that crazy stuff.

1433
01:24:16.210 --> 01:24:19.810
What protection?
Dignitary protection.
What does that,
um,

1434
01:24:20.110 --> 01:24:22.870
executive security consulting.
Oh,

1435
01:24:22.871 --> 01:24:27.550
so you're doing like bodyguard work for yeah,
I'm boil it.
Terry's,

1436
01:24:27.610 --> 01:24:30.880
yeah.
Dignitaries.
So it's a weird word,
right?
No,

1437
01:24:30.881 --> 01:24:35.881
it's the actual word to hear Terry dignitary protection or you're working with

1438
01:24:36.101 --> 01:24:38.100
like foreign agents and stuff like that?
Yeah,

1439
01:24:38.110 --> 01:24:41.990
it was on the presidential protection detail for airspeed in Haiti.
Oh Wow.
Yeah.

1440
01:24:42.220 --> 01:24:46.390
How weird is that?
Yeah,
I've had,
I've had a couple of jobs.
If you Google me,

1441
01:24:46.420 --> 01:24:49.420
you go like five pages back,
you'll hear all that other stuff.

1442
01:24:49.900 --> 01:24:52.750
But I so cause the fighting wasn't paying when I was fighting my,

1443
01:24:52.751 --> 01:24:56.860
my wife got pregnant and my son's 21,
I think I made 500 bucks the most.

1444
01:24:57.040 --> 01:25:00.190
Everyone I fought and you know,
I had to get a real job.

1445
01:25:00.191 --> 01:25:01.900
So I was going to school and uh,

1446
01:25:01.901 --> 01:25:05.020
and I was going to be a cop and then I met a guy,
Tony.
Scotty,

1447
01:25:05.160 --> 01:25:07.450
the Godfather of defensive tactics driving.

1448
01:25:07.451 --> 01:25:09.370
He let me in on a course with the State Department.

1449
01:25:09.460 --> 01:25:13.390
I impressed him and he made some introductions and I became a State Department

1450
01:25:13.391 --> 01:25:17.500
subcontractor and traveled the world and you know,
ran a company,

1451
01:25:17.501 --> 01:25:20.890
one of the largest private security companies in the world.
Steel Foundation.

1452
01:25:21.040 --> 01:25:23.080
I think.
They don't think they're around anymore.
I retired.

1453
01:25:23.110 --> 01:25:26.710
That's so interesting because whenever I see a gym as big as yours and I know

1454
01:25:26.711 --> 01:25:30.970
how hard it is to run a gym,
I always go,
ha,
how did that happen?
How'd that,

1455
01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:35.050
how'd that come together like that?
Because you know,
it's just so many gyms.

1456
01:25:35.051 --> 01:25:38.620
Common go and even good ones like look with MMA gyms.

1457
01:25:38.621 --> 01:25:41.020
We lost the Blackzilians.
That's gone.

1458
01:25:41.530 --> 01:25:46.510
I don't know what's going on with a team elevate in Denver.

1459
01:25:46.511 --> 01:25:51.330
I think that's where it Tj was.
Yes,
he did his camp here.
Yeah,

1460
01:25:51.590 --> 01:25:55.540
there.
Now.
Now they're at the,
what do they call it?
The training?

1461
01:25:56.530 --> 01:26:01.510
Yeah.
Rain.
Ari.
Supposing lab doesn't have anything to do with the old rain.

1462
01:26:01.511 --> 01:26:04.220
No,
no,
no,
no.
Mark is,
where's

1463
01:26:04.220 --> 01:26:08.810
<v 3>mark?
Mark.
Mark Andrews is somewhere else.
Now,
here's how so,</v>

1464
01:26:08.811 --> 01:26:12.230
so I've got just about,
been open for nine years with CSA.

1465
01:26:12.231 --> 01:26:16.070
We had zero members when we started.
I've got about 1300 what was the motivation?

1466
01:26:17.150 --> 01:26:21.830
The motivation was that I spent,
it was always a passion.

1467
01:26:21.860 --> 01:26:24.290
I was doing martial arts when I was a child.
I was fighting,

1468
01:26:24.320 --> 01:26:25.640
I just wasn't making money doing it.

1469
01:26:26.120 --> 01:26:31.120
And then I got into that other life and did that for about 15 years and I was

1470
01:26:32.121 --> 01:26:35.210
being paid to protect people that could afford it,

1471
01:26:35.211 --> 01:26:37.670
but maybe didn't deserve it for a very long time.

1472
01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.940
And unfortunately that's the way it works is if you can afford it,

1473
01:26:40.941 --> 01:26:44.710
you probably don't deserve it.
That's a funny way of life.
And it's a,
it's a,

1474
01:26:44.750 --> 01:26:47.960
it's a true way of looking at it because I was doing it at the highest level.

1475
01:26:47.990 --> 01:26:52.430
You know,
I wasn't doing security work at the kids' choice awards,

1476
01:26:52.431 --> 01:26:53.550
standing,
you know,

1477
01:26:53.910 --> 01:26:58.400
to Jim Carey for two hours saying I'm Jim Carey's bodyguard.
Right?

1478
01:26:58.401 --> 01:27:03.401
So it's one of those things where I saw it at the very highest level and it

1479
01:27:03.711 --> 01:27:08.090
just,
it turned me off after a while because you know,
you're just,
you're,

1480
01:27:08.120 --> 01:27:10.890
you're being a babysitter to people who have money.
Right.

1481
01:27:10.910 --> 01:27:14.060
Even with the biggest threats,
you know,
from Iraq,
Afghanistan,

1482
01:27:14.600 --> 01:27:16.160
a Haiti run down the list.

1483
01:27:16.490 --> 01:27:20.680
It wasn't about helping people and always wanting to help people.
So when I,

1484
01:27:20.970 --> 01:27:25.190
when I opened the gym,
that was the goal was to help people and it,

1485
01:27:25.250 --> 01:27:27.410
it turned into that gym.

1486
01:27:27.411 --> 01:27:32.270
And this is why I feel that our gym model is successful is because tonight at

1487
01:27:32.271 --> 01:27:34.160
five 30 during a boxing class,

1488
01:27:34.850 --> 01:27:38.480
my professional fighters are going to be in class with everyone else.

1489
01:27:38.810 --> 01:27:42.140
There's no protein only practice.

1490
01:27:42.230 --> 01:27:45.230
Everybody trains together.
Everybody works together.

1491
01:27:45.231 --> 01:27:49.340
The model is for people.
You want to get in shape,
wonderful.

1492
01:27:49.370 --> 01:27:51.980
You're going to get in the shape.
You want to have stress relief.
Wonderful.

1493
01:27:51.981 --> 01:27:53.660
You want to become a fighter.
Wonderful.

1494
01:27:53.661 --> 01:27:57.200
I don't have a fight team practice try out or any of that.

1495
01:27:57.440 --> 01:27:59.750
You come to the gym and you put in the work,
you support the team,

1496
01:27:59.751 --> 01:28:02.060
you trained side by side with world champions,
you get better,

1497
01:28:02.061 --> 01:28:05.780
you have a good time.
It's a huge family,
Jim.
It's a huge family,

1498
01:28:05.920 --> 01:28:09.920
a environment and the mixture of the self defense and the fighting and the

1499
01:28:09.921 --> 01:28:13.460
fitness one doesn't need the other.

1500
01:28:13.580 --> 01:28:16.670
So unlike like an Aka,
and I love Javie,

1501
01:28:16.671 --> 01:28:19.850
but the gym is about the fighters in a fighter's lose.

1502
01:28:20.540 --> 01:28:23.780
People go out the back door for me,
I kind of a fight or lose,

1503
01:28:23.781 --> 01:28:26.360
my membership's not going to matter by,
people are still going to come,

1504
01:28:26.361 --> 01:28:28.220
there's still going to train,
they're still gonna support.

1505
01:28:28.220 --> 01:28:30.980
They're still going to buy tickets.
And that's been the recipe.

1506
01:28:30.981 --> 01:28:32.600
And because of the gym is that way,

1507
01:28:32.990 --> 01:28:37.250
it's allowed me to have this model where I don't charge pro fighters.

1508
01:28:37.280 --> 01:28:41.240
So when you opened that,
that is really incredible and very,
very unique.

1509
01:28:41.510 --> 01:28:46.490
But when you open,
like how'd you get people to go?
Well when,
so what I would say,

1510
01:28:46.491 --> 01:28:48.980
I'm going to,
I'm going to sound full of myself here.
I'm just,

1511
01:28:48.981 --> 01:28:53.750
I'm very good at it.
Sure.
And you open up a gym,

1512
01:28:53.751 --> 01:28:56.780
it was going to go,
hey,
I want to go train with Mr. Perfect.
That's Ernesto,
who's,

1513
01:28:57.320 --> 01:29:00.470
you know,
for a guy like you to have such a massive,

1514
01:29:00.471 --> 01:29:05.250
massive gym and become one of the most respected gyms in the world.
Right?

1515
01:29:05.430 --> 01:29:09.750
Like it's,
it's a crazy path.
Like W so for me,

1516
01:29:09.751 --> 01:29:14.580
I think part of it was just,
I'm going to use a generic term hustle.

1517
01:29:14.850 --> 01:29:18.150
You know,
I,
you know,
like you look at Thai boxing coaches,
like you said,

1518
01:29:18.151 --> 01:29:22.410
there just aren't very good.
Did the ties here in America,

1519
01:29:22.411 --> 01:29:26.250
they don't take it seriously.
It's not the stadium.
If you're not in the stadium,

1520
01:29:26.251 --> 01:29:27.750
they don't care.
So you know,

1521
01:29:27.751 --> 01:29:31.830
other than John [inaudible] name a Thai coach that's coaching high level

1522
01:29:31.831 --> 01:29:35.490
fighters,
Thai boxing,
they're just not,
it's,
they're retired.
It's boring.

1523
01:29:35.491 --> 01:29:39.930
It's not real.
It's fun.
Right.
It's not a real thing for me.

1524
01:29:39.931 --> 01:29:44.160
I treated it like a real thing and I hustled my ass off and I made connections

1525
01:29:44.161 --> 01:29:47.090
and I worked in the reason that I could get so many people online if I just,

1526
01:29:47.100 --> 01:29:49.770
because his whole fucking tickets,
because I knew how the game was played,

1527
01:29:49.771 --> 01:29:51.450
I learned how to work with the judges.

1528
01:29:51.451 --> 01:29:55.170
I knew who was judging fights and how to score and how to deal.

1529
01:29:55.170 --> 01:29:56.820
And so all of that,

1530
01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:01.620
whereas a lot of coaches don't ever kind of get out of their own way.

1531
01:30:01.740 --> 01:30:05.050
They just,
they're so in their mantra of,
you know,

1532
01:30:05.060 --> 01:30:07.380
well I'm really good at what I do and you know,

1533
01:30:07.410 --> 01:30:11.410
this is traditional Thai boxing and this is how it should be scored.
No,
I'm,

1534
01:30:11.500 --> 01:30:16.170
every day I'm always adjusted.
We'd have fights like,
and hey,
you got a box man.

1535
01:30:16.290 --> 01:30:18.540
There's,
there's boxing judges,
other,
you've got a box.

1536
01:30:19.020 --> 01:30:22.080
Whereas maybe like we were in La,
I say,
oh,
did you know the,

1537
01:30:22.320 --> 01:30:26.610
the judges are more like ties,
so you can do that.
You can do your thing.
You know,

1538
01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:30.900
we've always adjusted.
Yeah.
So I think,
I think part of it is just,
it's,
it's,

1539
01:30:30.960 --> 01:30:34.770
it's drive,
it's hustle and it's its determination to be successful.
And that's,

1540
01:30:34.920 --> 01:30:37.110
you know,
for me,
you know,
that's,

1541
01:30:37.111 --> 01:30:41.130
that's what I have focused on with the gym and it's grown.
And like I said,

1542
01:30:41.131 --> 01:30:44.280
we started at one location we had,
it was 3,500 square feet.

1543
01:30:44.281 --> 01:30:47.010
I had zero students and then five,

1544
01:30:47.011 --> 01:30:50.280
three years we had 400 that's crazy.

1545
01:30:50.760 --> 01:30:54.660
It's hard to get a hundred students.
Yeah,
no.
Especially in Jujitsu schools,

1546
01:30:54.720 --> 01:30:58.080
Jujitsu schools,
that's the number.
That's the magical number.

1547
01:30:58.081 --> 01:31:02.400
You have a hundred students now you're making x amount per month cause you had a

1548
01:31:02.400 --> 01:31:05.460
hundred people paying x amount per month.
It's actually make a living.

1549
01:31:05.461 --> 01:31:08.400
It's the diversity.
Right.
So what happens is,

1550
01:31:08.401 --> 01:31:11.460
is that when people find out that maybe MMA isn't for them,

1551
01:31:11.910 --> 01:31:13.350
they can go into my fitness program.

1552
01:31:13.680 --> 01:31:16.530
When people find out that maybe fitness isn't for them,
they can go into my crop,

1553
01:31:16.531 --> 01:31:19.740
my God program,
they find out the crop,
isn't it for them.
And,

1554
01:31:19.741 --> 01:31:22.160
and the bottom line is also as,
I don't treat it like any kind of bullshit.

1555
01:31:22.200 --> 01:31:23.660
He have a tree crop McGaw program.

1556
01:31:23.670 --> 01:31:26.460
I do have a huge gramma got program huge of that program.

1557
01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:30.690
And it's the same thing.
It's like,
oh,
we do Krav Maga.
Listen,
all Krav Maga is,

1558
01:31:30.750 --> 01:31:34.230
is combat sports.
That's a little,
that's,
yeah,
I'm a fan of crop.
My God,

1559
01:31:34.620 --> 01:31:37.680
what crop [inaudible] guys is martial arts and that's it.
It's like they've just,

1560
01:31:37.710 --> 01:31:41.130
they've just developed self defense scenarios and they use real martial arts.

1561
01:31:41.210 --> 01:31:44.220
That's it.
And gave me real karate,
real Judy.

1562
01:31:44.250 --> 01:31:48.210
We do it and we do it even more combat sports that from all of my Kravis have to

1563
01:31:48.211 --> 01:31:51.110
go through grappling classes.
All the [inaudible] have to learn our combos,

1564
01:31:51.140 --> 01:31:55.780
the crop and got themselves Kravis it,
that's the term is crop.
It's promised.

1565
01:31:56.310 --> 01:32:00.070
But like if any Kravis dignitaries,
but

1566
01:32:00.400 --> 01:32:01.320
<v 5>I have taught,</v>

1567
01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:07.740
<v 0>did watch teach Krav Maga to the uh,
uh,
the Bolivian secret service.
Really?</v>

1568
01:32:07.741 --> 01:32:10.440
Yeah.
Wow.
That's good.
I didn't even know the story.

1569
01:32:10.470 --> 01:32:12.000
That won't sound that garden coke.

1570
01:32:12.130 --> 01:32:13.040
<v 5>Yeah,</v>

1571
01:32:16.400 --> 01:32:17.390
but narco shit.

1572
01:32:20.970 --> 01:32:21.300
<v 0>That's what,</v>

1573
01:32:21.300 --> 01:32:24.300
that's why I guarantee you do listen to this podcast is going to be a bunch of

1574
01:32:24.430 --> 01:32:26.730
profiles.
This is mother fucker.
Just say he doesn't charge

1575
01:32:29.100 --> 01:32:34.080
some more tie in California,
I'm paying two 50 a month for my gym.

1576
01:32:34.081 --> 01:32:37.090
What is going on?
Well,
yeah,
run down the list and,

1577
01:32:37.091 --> 01:32:41.940
and the percentage of the purse and then the sponsorships and all that pad work.

1578
01:32:41.941 --> 01:32:45.540
And then I remember one time this Jim,

1579
01:32:45.570 --> 01:32:48.120
I heard a friend from a gym that there were pain,
you know,

1580
01:32:48.121 --> 01:32:50.550
like $300 a month and like painting and like I,

1581
01:32:50.880 --> 01:32:54.510
I grew up with him so I don't know that I was like Karen,
you wouldn't believe

1582
01:32:54.700 --> 01:32:58.840
<v 5>going on over
there.
Robbing them,</v>

1583
01:32:59.970 --> 01:33:01.270
pay money for work.

1584
01:33:05.550 --> 01:33:07.120
It is Fliss

1585
01:33:07.120 --> 01:33:11.300
<v 0>of you.
Very impressive.
I'm very impressed by that.
I think that's amazing.</v>

1586
01:33:11.740 --> 01:33:15.400
You look,
you get a lot of Kudos in the combat sports world,

1587
01:33:15.401 --> 01:33:19.270
but I think that might be one where you deserve the most.
That's very,

1588
01:33:19.271 --> 01:33:22.450
very impressive.
That's incredible.
Oh,
and I love these kids.

1589
01:33:22.451 --> 01:33:25.300
I mean this is my son.
You do.
I know you and I do.
And Zoya.

1590
01:33:25.301 --> 01:33:29.080
That's my daughter and Kevin.
That's my son and Stephanie and Ed,
so you know,
it,

1591
01:33:29.081 --> 01:33:30.910
it,
it becomes a family and that's the thing.

1592
01:33:30.911 --> 01:33:32.620
It's like these people so I can get all the time.
It's like,
oh,

1593
01:33:32.621 --> 01:33:36.460
what do I need to do to train at CSA?
You need to move there.
Do you have dorms?

1594
01:33:36.520 --> 01:33:39.340
Nope.
I don't have dorms.
You want to train with me?

1595
01:33:39.341 --> 01:33:41.440
You got to move here and you got to,
and you've got to want it.

1596
01:33:41.440 --> 01:33:45.460
Dorms is when it gets sketchy.
You got a bunch of Weird dudes living in your gym.

1597
01:33:46.050 --> 01:33:50.350
No boy.
But you gotta really,
really,

1598
01:33:50.351 --> 01:33:54.100
really want to train with me because you got to figure out where to live.

1599
01:33:54.101 --> 01:33:58.300
You got to figure out what to do.
Like Diego Llamas,
Gloria kickboxing fighter,

1600
01:33:58.630 --> 01:34:01.390
he showed up when the he,
he messaged Kevin one time.

1601
01:34:01.391 --> 01:34:02.580
I think from what I hear the story,

1602
01:34:02.590 --> 01:34:05.830
it was just me and Kevin doesn't reply that like,
I don't know,

1603
01:34:05.831 --> 01:34:08.740
like he hasn't replied to just anybody like that either.

1604
01:34:08.741 --> 01:34:11.530
We're talking a little bit,
it's like,
oh yeah,
you should come down like you know,

1605
01:34:11.531 --> 01:34:13.440
for a couple of weeks,
whatever shows up as a,
hey,

1606
01:34:13.441 --> 01:34:16.660
I just moved here to the doors from Mexico,
brought his wife,

1607
01:34:16.880 --> 01:34:20.590
got shut down as gym.
Yeah,
I just moved here.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1608
01:34:21.280 --> 01:34:24.790
You told me I had to move here.
So it's part of the team now.

1609
01:34:25.540 --> 01:34:29.980
What does that feel like to you?
Because that's heavy responsibility,
man.
Listen,

1610
01:34:30.040 --> 01:34:32.770
listen man.
Here,
here's my philosophy is this is when a fighter wins.

1611
01:34:32.771 --> 01:34:37.300
They did their job when a fighter loses.
I didn't.
And it's just that simple.

1612
01:34:37.630 --> 01:34:41.150
It's literally that simple.
It's not that

1613
01:34:43.040 --> 01:34:44.380
he could have helped them out to me.

1614
01:34:44.950 --> 01:34:47.550
So right now let's say you train the guy who fights Anderson.

1615
01:34:47.560 --> 01:34:52.540
So I'll use no use Alexis.
Alexis,
fuck Caitlyn.
And I thought it bottom line.

1616
01:34:52.541 --> 01:34:55.540
I think Alexis won that fight.
I can see why she didn't.

1617
01:34:55.570 --> 01:34:58.250
She wears her fights on her face.
Like,
you know,
like Zoya

1618
01:34:58.250 --> 01:35:00.590
<v 3>does like literally if you blow it Alexis,
she's,</v>

1619
01:35:00.591 --> 01:35:05.480
she swells up was a very close fight.
Exactly.
But if you,

1620
01:35:05.540 --> 01:35:09.380
if you look at her the wrong way,
she's gonna Swell up.
Right.
And I know that.

1621
01:35:09.440 --> 01:35:13.850
So for me,
w w the game plan was very simple,

1622
01:35:13.851 --> 01:35:17.060
very specific.
There were pieces of the game plan that worked.

1623
01:35:17.090 --> 01:35:20.240
The right leg kick moved her where we needed to move her to the left body kick

1624
01:35:20.241 --> 01:35:23.120
was also part of the game plan to take away what we needed.

1625
01:35:23.330 --> 01:35:26.690
Alexis wasn't throwing it,
Alexis didn't throw it.
Whose fault is that?

1626
01:35:27.050 --> 01:35:28.060
Mine or Alexis?

1627
01:35:28.190 --> 01:35:32.090
In my mind it's my fault because I didn't see that that wasn't going to happen.

1628
01:35:32.091 --> 01:35:34.520
She's throwing it in and other fights.
So what did I do wrong?

1629
01:35:34.580 --> 01:35:38.900
How did I miss that half of the game plan that would have won this fight very

1630
01:35:38.901 --> 01:35:43.340
easily in my opinion,
a hundred percent.
Yeah.
Um,
it didn't happen.

1631
01:35:43.970 --> 01:35:46.640
I can sit back and be mad at the fighter or I can sit back and say,

1632
01:35:46.641 --> 01:35:50.390
you missed this in training.
You need to figure out how to avoid this.

1633
01:35:50.391 --> 01:35:54.290
You need to learn from it.
And that's what I do every single fight.

1634
01:35:54.590 --> 01:35:58.640
When you're watching fights at home and he see like a guy,

1635
01:35:59.650 --> 01:36:01.160
one of the things that drives me nuts,

1636
01:36:01.161 --> 01:36:04.970
what I'm doing commentary like see a guy start to soften some dude off with leg

1637
01:36:04.971 --> 01:36:05.520
kicks,

1638
01:36:05.520 --> 01:36:09.900
starts to get that leg buckling a little bit and then inexplicably they stopped.

1639
01:36:11.400 --> 01:36:13.790
But there's a reason they stopped their own it.
They're,
they're not,

1640
01:36:14.120 --> 01:36:16.580
they're not conditioning their shin and they're hurting themselves.

1641
01:36:17.010 --> 01:36:18.150
The a hundred percent of the thing,

1642
01:36:18.540 --> 01:36:21.170
or it could be they heard him with a right hand and they got,

1643
01:36:21.380 --> 01:36:23.840
they got punch happy that too.

1644
01:36:23.841 --> 01:36:27.080
But most of the time when I see people stop kicking on a leg kick that works,

1645
01:36:27.081 --> 01:36:29.240
it's because they're feeling it and they're like two because they don't

1646
01:36:29.241 --> 01:36:30.410
condition their shins properly.

1647
01:36:31.160 --> 01:36:33.680
That's why I've talked to people about it and there's,
so for me,

1648
01:36:33.700 --> 01:36:35.450
you're absolutely right.
You rock somebody with the right hand,

1649
01:36:35.451 --> 01:36:38.170
you go head hunting hundred percent.
Um,

1650
01:36:38.210 --> 01:36:42.280
but a lot of the time people do not condition their legs.
They don't,
you know,

1651
01:36:42.310 --> 01:36:45.260
now you've got everybody going after the calf kick and if you don't know how to

1652
01:36:45.261 --> 01:36:47.750
throw a calf kick and if you don't know how to deal with,

1653
01:36:47.780 --> 01:36:49.160
if you after a calf kick,

1654
01:36:49.200 --> 01:36:53.150
invariably you're going to catch shin a lot of the time.

1655
01:36:53.600 --> 01:36:57.590
So if you're not conditioning your leg,
you okay,
you land a couple of calf kicks.

1656
01:36:58.030 --> 01:37:00.590
But uh,
you know,
when you talk about mighty mouse,
you know,

1657
01:37:00.591 --> 01:37:03.530
he landed a beautiful calf kick in that first round.
That's what hurt Henry.

1658
01:37:03.890 --> 01:37:04.641
But he kept,

1659
01:37:04.641 --> 01:37:07.790
he caught some Shin to and I guarantee you that didn't help as broke his foot.

1660
01:37:07.820 --> 01:37:10.130
That didn't help.
Yeah.
Mighty mouse broke his foot and that fight,

1661
01:37:10.131 --> 01:37:14.830
he's got videos of it on right now.
It's a side of,
it was,
I struggled and,
and,

1662
01:37:14.930 --> 01:37:18.890
and that's very easy to do if you know how to check.
Literally,

1663
01:37:18.891 --> 01:37:23.660
if you check properly,
you want to care of a calf cakes at all.
I know.

1664
01:37:23.661 --> 01:37:27.290
I'm just going to check it.
Like I might eat one like match Chanel for example,

1665
01:37:27.291 --> 01:37:30.110
that he comes down and he trains with us.
He loves to throw a calf kicks.

1666
01:37:30.111 --> 01:37:31.480
And I'm like,
all right,
throw it.

1667
01:37:31.510 --> 01:37:34.910
Like I'm just going to just going to check it every time and I'll counter

1668
01:37:34.940 --> 01:37:35.360
properly.

1669
01:37:35.360 --> 01:37:38.690
If you know how to check a leg kick and you know how to check a calf kick,

1670
01:37:38.810 --> 01:37:40.970
you're going to hurt the person doing it 100% of the time.

1671
01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:44.190
What do you recommend for Qi?
Shin conditioning?
Um,

1672
01:37:44.570 --> 01:37:49.160
nothing crazy progressive.
A dense contact.

1673
01:37:49.520 --> 01:37:53.960
So starting with a heavy bag and then a more densely packed heavy bag.

1674
01:37:53.961 --> 01:37:56.070
And then eventually you can get to sand bag.
Yeah.

1675
01:37:57.070 --> 01:37:57.903
<v 0>And that's what we do.</v>

1676
01:37:57.930 --> 01:38:02.310
We've got three different levels of bag in the gym and we've got standard bag,

1677
01:38:03.060 --> 01:38:07.650
densely packed bag and then sandbag.
Sandbag.
Yeah.
Damn.

1678
01:38:07.651 --> 01:38:11.730
Who makes it sandbag?
Nobody does you make it?
You,
Kevin,
Kevin,
Kevin,
eight hours.

1679
01:38:12.070 --> 01:38:14.620
Eight hours.
Yeah.
So just go to the hardware store?
Yeah,

1680
01:38:14.700 --> 01:38:18.270
no kick in sticks or anything like that.
So what do you,
uh,

1681
01:38:18.420 --> 01:38:22.230
how do you know what kind of line or do you use to fill up with sand?

1682
01:38:22.290 --> 01:38:23.670
So it's a standard uses.

1683
01:38:23.790 --> 01:38:27.150
So you can put a liner in or if you've got a really good bag,

1684
01:38:27.180 --> 01:38:30.450
then you know it'll be okay.
But you put in basically a garbage bag,

1685
01:38:30.720 --> 01:38:35.000
a a well done garbage bag,
lawn contractor,
and then,

1686
01:38:35.120 --> 01:38:38.100
and then you don't want to go just sand.
It's still stuffing,

1687
01:38:39.930 --> 01:38:42.720
stuffing and sand,
stuffing and sand.

1688
01:38:42.721 --> 01:38:46.800
And then you build from there and then it'll be denser at the bottom and then

1689
01:38:46.801 --> 01:38:49.290
you start kicking higher and then you work your way down the bag.

1690
01:38:49.560 --> 01:38:50.940
And it's not even about cracking it,

1691
01:38:50.941 --> 01:38:54.990
it's just about conditioning the Shin as evenly as possible.

1692
01:38:55.440 --> 01:38:59.520
Just deadening it up and putting those little calcium deposits all over evenly

1693
01:38:59.521 --> 01:39:02.580
as possible.
That's why I'm not a big fan of the rolling and the,

1694
01:39:02.581 --> 01:39:04.980
and the hitting and because all you're doing is you're just,
you're,

1695
01:39:05.010 --> 01:39:09.330
you're creating these little micro breaks and fractures in variable spots.

1696
01:39:09.331 --> 01:39:13.890
It's not spreading across the Shin the same way when you'd have a kicking target

1697
01:39:13.891 --> 01:39:16.920
like a bag.
And it also seems like if you're throwing kicks,

1698
01:39:16.921 --> 01:39:19.650
it's going to be a more realistic application.
You know,

1699
01:39:19.651 --> 01:39:23.550
it's like the fashion kicks on something and hardening your shins up.
Just seems.

1700
01:39:24.420 --> 01:39:27.810
I've seen guys do that with like coke bottles,
you know,
I've seen all that stuff.

1701
01:39:27.811 --> 01:39:31.350
It just doesn't,
no one ever doesn't work.
I know.
I've never done that in my life.

1702
01:39:31.380 --> 01:39:35.430
Really?
Yeah.
Yeah.
But you use that sandbag a sandbag.
Yeah.
How often you use it?

1703
01:39:36.740 --> 01:39:37.170
Well,

1704
01:39:37.170 --> 01:39:40.890
especially I used to even more so when I have a Thai or kickboxing fights coming

1705
01:39:40.891 --> 01:39:44.430
up,
but I'll use it every day.
Yeah,
absolutely.

1706
01:39:44.480 --> 01:39:47.100
It just doesn't have to be something that's hours and hours at a time.

1707
01:39:47.101 --> 01:39:48.010
Drills and you know,

1708
01:39:48.420 --> 01:39:52.440
it's amazing how much that low calf kick has made its way into MMA and how much

1709
01:39:52.441 --> 01:39:53.580
it changes.
Fights.
Yeah.

1710
01:39:53.740 --> 01:39:57.510
And timebox Benson Henderson was the first one to use it back then when he was a

1711
01:39:57.511 --> 01:40:00.210
champion.
Even before that,
in Thai,

1712
01:40:00.211 --> 01:40:03.020
boxing is considered kind of dirty and you know.
Yeah.

1713
01:40:03.090 --> 01:40:07.320
That's why I don't see it as much in boxing or dirt.
A little dirty.
Yeah.
Wow.

1714
01:40:07.500 --> 01:40:10.680
Yeah.
That's why you don't see it that much.
It's like,
ah,
you know,

1715
01:40:10.681 --> 01:40:15.000
it's low hanging fruit.
It's cheap.
It works.
Absolutely.

1716
01:40:15.150 --> 01:40:16.140
Why would it be?

1717
01:40:16.170 --> 01:40:21.170
That's it's weird how Paul the Thai boxing is corn is different in Thailand and

1718
01:40:21.320 --> 01:40:22.320
in here.
Well,
you know,

1719
01:40:22.321 --> 01:40:26.700
for the longest time when Jujitsu leg locks were dirty and people would go crazy

1720
01:40:26.701 --> 01:40:29.880
if you went for a leg block,
they would blue until you released it.

1721
01:40:29.881 --> 01:40:32.730
People would scream at you.
Coaches would say,
just let it go.
Just let it go.

1722
01:40:32.910 --> 01:40:36.390
Let the leg lock go.
Ricardo was had that leg log,
uh,

1723
01:40:36.420 --> 01:40:40.800
and his fight regarding Ramos,
I it was d the only thing is he made,

1724
01:40:40.801 --> 01:40:43.640
he tried to make that adjustment and go behind the armpit and they,

1725
01:40:43.641 --> 01:40:47.690
I just got off.
It's just he was doing it like they were grappling.
Yeah.
You know,

1726
01:40:47.780 --> 01:40:49.990
which is a thing that people do.
Do you know,

1727
01:40:50.010 --> 01:40:52.860
you forget that the guy can just stand up like you,

1728
01:40:53.170 --> 01:40:55.330
that he's going to stay engaged with you.
Yeah.

1729
01:40:55.530 --> 01:40:57.250
It's a common mistake that people do,

1730
01:40:57.310 --> 01:41:00.670
but he just made an adjustment and you know,
the guy who fought was good man.

1731
01:41:01.200 --> 01:41:04.860
It was a close fight fight.
Very,
very good match up there.

1732
01:41:04.861 --> 01:41:08.200
You could match up like there was a lot of those Saturday night.

1733
01:41:08.201 --> 01:41:11.360
There's a lot of like really good ones.
The last one in the prelims I was,

1734
01:41:11.361 --> 01:41:16.150
I was there at the fights.
Is it my car?
No,
no,
no.
The prelims.
The prelims.

1735
01:41:16.270 --> 01:41:19.660
That wasn't in the prelims.
No,
no,
that wasn't the main card.
Oh,
okay.
Right.

1736
01:41:20.170 --> 01:41:24.160
That's right.
That's right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Ruts.
Right.
Cub Swanson,
Jesus Christ.

1737
01:41:24.161 --> 01:41:27.040
More coddled.
Look good.
Yeah.
Holy Shit.
The Jab.

1738
01:41:27.130 --> 01:41:29.620
But he's a fucking real technician man.

1739
01:41:29.650 --> 01:41:32.920
He's big for each other.
Wait.
Yeah.

1740
01:41:32.921 --> 01:41:37.440
For 45 11 and butt looks big and when you're standing next frame,

1741
01:41:37.810 --> 01:41:42.410
he's 170 pounds and he's in the inside.
The actual case itself,
Dude,

1742
01:41:43.030 --> 01:41:46.240
he's just very technical man.
Like everything he does,
he's,

1743
01:41:46.340 --> 01:41:50.070
there's no sloppiness to them.
Like everything.
And then can we kill it?

1744
01:41:50.071 --> 01:41:51.580
It dropped him with a jab.

1745
01:41:51.610 --> 01:41:54.190
I mean it looks like he hit him with a fucking straight right hand on the
button.

1746
01:41:54.210 --> 01:41:55.510
Yeah,
it's crazy.
Yeah.

1747
01:41:55.780 --> 01:41:59.290
Well that's cub Watson couples coming in at the same time do it,
which is true,

1748
01:41:59.320 --> 01:42:02.680
but he's so long and they stiff arm.
It's just,
it was,

1749
01:42:02.800 --> 01:42:06.910
it was the way it snapped in there too.
It was just perfect.
Perfect timing.

1750
01:42:07.090 --> 01:42:10.690
And then to take cubs back that quick and get them in that rear naked choke like

1751
01:42:10.691 --> 01:42:14.260
that.
Like wow.
Massive white candles.
No joke.
I'm standing up.

1752
01:42:14.890 --> 01:42:17.440
The level of talent is so high right now.

1753
01:42:17.441 --> 01:42:22.300
It's really fascinating because there's guys that aren't even in the top 15 that

1754
01:42:22.301 --> 01:42:26.260
looked like world champions from 10 years ago.
Yeah,
it's really interesting.
Yeah,

1755
01:42:26.261 --> 01:42:29.620
no,
the,
the adaption is,
I say it all the time.
Again,

1756
01:42:29.621 --> 01:42:33.550
I'm known as a Moyie Thai coach,
but the best movie time strikers,
you know,

1757
01:42:33.820 --> 01:42:38.620
don't have the best success in UFC striking.
You know,
it's,
it's,
it's,
it's so,

1758
01:42:38.650 --> 01:42:43.630
you know,
the most decorated best Muay Thai guys and Gals,

1759
01:42:43.631 --> 01:42:47.590
you know,
Joanna,
you know,
you have to put her up there.
Valentina,

1760
01:42:47.830 --> 01:42:51.490
you have to put up there.
These are legit world champions.

1761
01:42:51.520 --> 01:42:54.790
Not Somebody who went to Florida and when the Ikea of classic or something like

1762
01:42:54.791 --> 01:42:56.920
that.
But on the guy's side,

1763
01:42:56.921 --> 01:43:01.120
you look at like the two best Muay Thai guys ever.
Uh,
you know,

1764
01:43:01.670 --> 01:43:05.800
you,
you look at Shane Campbell and I don't know if you know Shane's background,

1765
01:43:05.801 --> 01:43:09.520
but Shane Campbell literally was a world beater and Moyie Thai from Canada,

1766
01:43:09.760 --> 01:43:10.750
his last fight with UFC,

1767
01:43:10.751 --> 01:43:14.440
he got dropped with a body shot and got cut because he could never really sit

1768
01:43:14.441 --> 01:43:16.990
down on his strikes cause it's always worried about the tickets.

1769
01:43:17.890 --> 01:43:19.720
And then there's a little gloves as well.
Exactly.

1770
01:43:19.730 --> 01:43:24.730
Hakeem Hakeem world beater and Moyie Thai world champion.

1771
01:43:25.360 --> 01:43:28.870
It was his first fight out.
He got 20 some odd seconds and got knocked out with,

1772
01:43:28.871 --> 01:43:33.520
well how about Saki?
Exactly right.
It's round trees.

1773
01:43:33.521 --> 01:43:34.440
A bad motherfucker.

1774
01:43:34.470 --> 01:43:38.800
No taken away from Roundtree and he hits hard but it's crazy watching go con get

1775
01:43:38.801 --> 01:43:42.250
cracked and knocked out with one shot.
It's like a little globes.
Definitely.

1776
01:43:42.251 --> 01:43:43.360
You have an out of the plane,

1777
01:43:44.270 --> 01:43:48.700
you have to respect the little gloves and you have to respect the other

1778
01:43:48.701 --> 01:43:52.760
influences in MMA.
Okay.
When,
and again I'm,

1779
01:43:52.790 --> 01:43:57.470
I'm probably one of the few coaches that'll like fixate on on losses and try to

1780
01:43:57.471 --> 01:43:59.990
really,
really learn from them.
When he,

1781
01:43:59.991 --> 01:44:02.540
you watched his second MMA fight where he lost right.

1782
01:44:03.200 --> 01:44:08.200
The guest on and he in that moment came out very slow twitch.

1783
01:44:10.070 --> 01:44:12.260
He was very almost McGregor.

1784
01:44:12.260 --> 01:44:16.340
Ascii was going through a little phase that I didn't pick up on in camp and he

1785
01:44:16.341 --> 01:44:19.880
comes out in this kid that he's fighting as a karate kid.
Super talented kid.

1786
01:44:20.270 --> 01:44:20.960
Right.

1787
01:44:20.960 --> 01:44:25.960
And literally the speed at which they were fighting stylistically was different.

1788
01:44:26.660 --> 01:44:31.460
He was in second gear and this kid was in fifth year.
You agree with us?
Yeah,

1789
01:44:31.650 --> 01:44:35.400
absolutely.
What was,
what was the motivation behind your changing of your style?

1790
01:44:35.401 --> 01:44:36.860
A bit.
Like I said,

1791
01:44:36.861 --> 01:44:41.350
I was going through a lot of that time and I just didn't want to start.

1792
01:44:41.420 --> 01:44:43.150
Yeah,
I remember like what?

1793
01:44:43.160 --> 01:44:48.110
Just walking out I just wasn't like focused.
Yeah.
Like I said,

1794
01:44:48.111 --> 01:44:50.270
like my last kickbox if I have the five before that,

1795
01:44:50.271 --> 01:44:54.110
I just felt even the spinning back elbow one I just felt at home.
I was like,

1796
01:44:54.111 --> 01:44:56.990
yeah,
you can see me smiling.
Like you know dude,

1797
01:44:57.110 --> 01:45:01.160
I just sitting back elbow might be the greatest spinning back elbow Kayo in the

1798
01:45:01.161 --> 01:45:04.160
history of MMA.
Thank you man.
That shit was ridiculous.

1799
01:45:04.400 --> 01:45:07.310
We played it on his podcast.
He's like,

1800
01:45:07.311 --> 01:45:10.930
you want to see it spinning elbow cause I heard about,

1801
01:45:11.120 --> 01:45:15.110
I heard you're talking about it with Kevin Lee to this.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1802
01:45:15.800 --> 01:45:18.970
When that elbow hit his jaw,
here it is budgetary.

1803
01:45:19.820 --> 01:45:23.750
Oh come on man.
I mean that that is,

1804
01:45:24.140 --> 01:45:27.080
that's the greatest spinning elbow of all time.
Like it just is.

1805
01:45:27.310 --> 01:45:30.230
I mean it can't get any better and he's done that yet.

1806
01:45:30.231 --> 01:45:32.990
Can't get better eight times.
It's done that eight times.

1807
01:45:32.991 --> 01:45:36.380
I'm not till I landing it.
I'm talking about finishing fights with that elbow,

1808
01:45:37.270 --> 01:45:40.830
but that's the best of all the ones he's,
in my opinion,

1809
01:45:40.920 --> 01:45:43.680
that's the best way to land charts.
That's the best word.

1810
01:45:43.681 --> 01:45:46.880
And I know when they're coming in you're for the force of their punch.

1811
01:45:47.480 --> 01:45:52.160
Let me say that one more time.
See I slipped the jab at the same time.
What?

1812
01:45:52.161 --> 01:45:56.580
You threw that kick first?
Yeah,
he's coming in with a slipping.
Oh my God.

1813
01:45:56.581 --> 01:45:57.560
He's not expecting it.

1814
01:45:57.561 --> 01:46:01.430
He's coming in with that with the strike and he's not expecting to get hit.
Dude,

1815
01:46:01.431 --> 01:46:04.540
that is so ridiculous.
But now everybody,
he changed,
he,

1816
01:46:04.640 --> 01:46:07.070
he literally changed when we tie in America.
He didn't invent that,

1817
01:46:07.130 --> 01:46:11.000
but it was the first time anybody saw it and amateur tournaments.

1818
01:46:11.001 --> 01:46:11.930
Now like in California,

1819
01:46:11.931 --> 01:46:16.700
you cannot throw a spinning elbow until after your fourth amateur fight because

1820
01:46:16.701 --> 01:46:21.590
of him.
Wow.
Because it's so deep.
It changed.
The game does so much damage.

1821
01:46:22.880 --> 01:46:26.150
It does so much damage and the way he throws it does damage.

1822
01:46:26.151 --> 01:46:29.300
Like if you see like John has thrown it,
like John Jones,
there was a,

1823
01:46:29.540 --> 01:46:33.470
but he hits the forearms because he throws it horizontally.
As tall as John Is.

1824
01:46:33.471 --> 01:46:35.330
If John wants to finish people with that elbow,

1825
01:46:35.331 --> 01:46:39.230
he needs to come down with it and he's the arc down and drop his weight.

1826
01:46:39.440 --> 01:46:43.550
Even if their shell,
he'll split down the middle.
The angle at which he throws.

1827
01:46:43.551 --> 01:46:44.510
If you're taller than him,

1828
01:46:44.511 --> 01:46:47.090
he's going to come underneath and you're shorter than him.
Are the same height.

1829
01:46:47.190 --> 01:46:50.730
Also throw it like at the same time as I'm throwing a right hand and I just go

1830
01:46:50.740 --> 01:46:54.420
through,
so I'll throw it either.
Either way.
I'll go either way.
Yeah.

1831
01:46:54.421 --> 01:46:58.320
He's knocked people out on both sides.
It's not just one side.
It's very,

1832
01:46:58.530 --> 01:46:59.310
very effective way.

1833
01:46:59.310 --> 01:47:03.930
I've always felt like the best people that transition from kickboxing to MMA or

1834
01:47:03.931 --> 01:47:05.400
the really explosive ones,

1835
01:47:05.401 --> 01:47:09.870
which is one of the reasons why cro cop did so well in MMA,

1836
01:47:09.871 --> 01:47:12.900
not just because he dedicated them to dedicated himself to it,

1837
01:47:12.901 --> 01:47:13.950
which was a huge factor,

1838
01:47:14.250 --> 01:47:18.810
but also because when you watch cro cop and k one he was a exploder.

1839
01:47:18.900 --> 01:47:23.190
He would like take pot shots at people and just,
he would have twitch.
Yeah,

1840
01:47:23.220 --> 01:47:26.130
and he would have a naked kick or a naked punch.
Like he,

1841
01:47:26.280 --> 01:47:30.300
he wasn't like a guy who is throwing a lot of technical stuff and setting things

1842
01:47:30.301 --> 01:47:32.720
up.
He would whack out of nowhere.

1843
01:47:32.721 --> 01:47:35.310
I throw full power full cause he was so fast.

1844
01:47:35.700 --> 01:47:40.080
And that translates extremely well to MMA in my opinion.

1845
01:47:40.590 --> 01:47:44.450
The pace of Moy,
Tai,
it can be a little slower.
Yeah.

1846
01:47:44.500 --> 01:47:48.210
So when you're dealing with like with his fight,
like I said,
he's coming in,

1847
01:47:48.270 --> 01:47:51.570
you know,
relaxed and,
and,
and slow twitch and thinking,

1848
01:47:51.571 --> 01:47:53.430
timing and bouncing a little bit.

1849
01:47:53.431 --> 01:47:57.390
And this kid is a karate kid and he's immediately,
like you said,
flip right.

1850
01:47:57.391 --> 01:47:59.850
You don't see it coming,
you get caught.
Right.

1851
01:48:00.090 --> 01:48:04.170
So that's where I think Stryker's that listen and no disrespect to that kid.

1852
01:48:04.200 --> 01:48:07.770
I think that kid is one of the best,
uh,
one of the Brandon,

1853
01:48:07.800 --> 01:48:12.000
I can't remember his last name,
one of the best of him.
His name is Brandon.
Um,

1854
01:48:12.360 --> 01:48:14.530
I forget his last name.
You don't remember him?
I can't,

1855
01:48:14.880 --> 01:48:15.900
I can't remember his last name.

1856
01:48:16.050 --> 01:48:19.740
Most people when they lose to that names etched in their fucking head forever.

1857
01:48:19.770 --> 01:48:23.190
Nah,
he let it go.
You got it.
You got to,
you got to let it go,
man.
You got to go.

1858
01:48:23.550 --> 01:48:27.000
But that kid,
he's,
he's tell you,
if you don't,
we'll find his name.

1859
01:48:27.390 --> 01:48:29.640
What's his name?
Jamie.
Just put look,
pull up.

1860
01:48:29.730 --> 01:48:34.710
Gaston's which should be insured though.
Norellco wired is Larocco.

1861
01:48:34.800 --> 01:48:38.940
Yeah.
That,
that kid isn't Uber talented kids.
I was very impressed by.
Absolutely.

1862
01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:42.210
And you know,
he might not have guessed ons.
Look,

1863
01:48:42.211 --> 01:48:45.150
you might not have some of what guests Dan brings to the table and he hasn't

1864
01:48:45.151 --> 01:48:49.710
really caught on since super talented kid.
He wasn't disrespected in that fight.

1865
01:48:49.890 --> 01:48:54.690
He just wasn't.
Uh,
he wasn't,
there was no film on him.
We didn't know who he was.

1866
01:48:54.840 --> 01:48:59.520
His style was not anticipated and he came out super slow and he got fucking con.

1867
01:48:59.670 --> 01:49:00.670
Do you may,

1868
01:49:00.900 --> 01:49:05.040
do you train much with karate stylists or someone who's got that?

1869
01:49:05.190 --> 01:49:08.430
Cause it seems to me that it's like when you have like a wonder boy Thompson

1870
01:49:08.431 --> 01:49:12.240
style there,
there's,
there's,
there's something to that.
You know,

1871
01:49:12.241 --> 01:49:15.060
there's something to that that's like,
it's very weird to deal with.

1872
01:49:15.070 --> 01:49:17.550
It's a different,
when people are Unorthodox in general,

1873
01:49:17.551 --> 01:49:22.350
it's just so hard to like really make Daniels is another one and it's hard to,

1874
01:49:22.380 --> 01:49:25.370
it's hard to really like get going with people like that.
And like uh,

1875
01:49:25.410 --> 01:49:26.490
like Karen was saying,

1876
01:49:26.940 --> 01:49:30.700
I come from a background like a five round Moitai fight is different and I got

1877
01:49:30.780 --> 01:49:34.260
normally and he can agree with me like my first few fights I take the first

1878
01:49:34.261 --> 01:49:38.040
round off.
I'm just like all right let's get going.
Let's see what he's got right.

1879
01:49:38.100 --> 01:49:41.220
It's like we have,
we got five rounds to work here.
Right.

1880
01:49:41.310 --> 01:49:43.740
That's where Kevin said the most trouble with kickboxing because,

1881
01:49:43.741 --> 01:49:48.060
because he's used to five rounds,
the first round is just of feel him

1882
01:49:48.060 --> 01:49:52.870
<v 2>out.
You know?
And so as coaches it's our job to change that.</v>

1883
01:49:52.871 --> 01:49:56.440
And that's what I struggle with that a lot with my tie guys.
Cause again,

1884
01:49:56.710 --> 01:49:58.930
I'll make legs Zoya I'll make guest on,

1885
01:49:59.110 --> 01:50:01.990
I have these guys fighting when we tie fights as well cause it's definitely

1886
01:50:01.991 --> 01:50:06.400
going to help your striking.
But if you fixate on that rhythm,

1887
01:50:06.401 --> 01:50:08.530
that foot work,
that timing and MMA,

1888
01:50:09.130 --> 01:50:11.470
that's where you're going to have the most trouble.

1889
01:50:11.500 --> 01:50:14.410
So those karate stylists are going to give you trouble and the wrestlers are

1890
01:50:14.411 --> 01:50:16.390
going to give you trouble cause you're never going to have to sit down on

1891
01:50:16.391 --> 01:50:16.750
anything.

1892
01:50:16.750 --> 01:50:20.050
Well Michael Van and page is probably one of the most exciting guys in del

1893
01:50:20.051 --> 01:50:24.340
towards his last fight to God,
not the boxing one.
No.
Then when they fight,

1894
01:50:24.341 --> 01:50:29.140
it was in March.
Oh my God,
he's a monster.
But it's that style.
Is that bully?

1895
01:50:29.260 --> 01:50:32.710
You ever see him fight Raymond Daniels and a point karate?
No,
I did it.

1896
01:50:32.720 --> 01:50:35.940
Some videos of them fighting on.
It's crazy.
They're sprinting at each other.

1897
01:50:38.060 --> 01:50:42.070
They're so fucking fast.
But I've said for a while that I think there's,

1898
01:50:42.071 --> 01:50:46.210
there's something really good to that,
that ability to blitz,

1899
01:50:46.640 --> 01:50:49.630
especially when you're dealing with little gloves and you know,
and,

1900
01:50:50.080 --> 01:50:53.440
and MMA rules.
I just think that there's,
that's a,

1901
01:50:53.441 --> 01:50:57.760
that's a really important skill that a lot of people don't have that ability to

1902
01:50:57.761 --> 01:51:02.280
blitz.
And if you have that sort of slow first round Thai style here,

1903
01:51:02.410 --> 01:51:04.630
here's the two of these guys.
I look at that with down,

1904
01:51:04.660 --> 01:51:08.920
I mean this is like fast twitch muscle or heaven.
I want to say this is,

1905
01:51:09.220 --> 01:51:12.730
yeah,
there it is.
Yeah.
So seven years ago they want to take,

1906
01:51:12.731 --> 01:51:16.060
he chose his so fast,
but they're trying to score points.
You know,

1907
01:51:16.061 --> 01:51:18.510
this is such a different game.
You know,
I,

1908
01:51:18.511 --> 01:51:22.090
I did a little bit of this stuff when I was competing.
It's so different.

1909
01:51:22.180 --> 01:51:24.510
The range is so it's beautiful to watch.

1910
01:51:25.140 --> 01:51:28.700
They stop it with every strike.
Oh they stop it.
Yup.

1911
01:51:28.780 --> 01:51:32.110
Every time you touch each other they stop it and they score a point.

1912
01:51:32.300 --> 01:51:36.450
So it's super unrealistic in terms of an actual fight and the,

1913
01:51:36.451 --> 01:51:39.520
the thought process behind it is nonsense.

1914
01:51:39.640 --> 01:51:43.060
The thought process was that you should be able to kill somebody with one punch

1915
01:51:43.330 --> 01:51:45.670
and then all you have to do is touch them and then stop.

1916
01:51:45.700 --> 01:51:48.160
That could have killed the guy.
It's,
it's nonsense.

1917
01:51:48.250 --> 01:51:53.170
But the benefit to it as much like the benefit of learning taekwondo early,

1918
01:51:53.440 --> 01:51:57.460
you learn taekwondo early because you develop leg dexterity that you would never

1919
01:51:57.461 --> 01:52:01.450
develop if you threw in leg kicks and punches and take downs and all those other

1920
01:52:01.451 --> 01:52:05.070
things.
It's very rare that someone goes through a,
just a,

1921
01:52:05.071 --> 01:52:09.520
a traditional martial arts bat or a traditional MMA background where you're just

1922
01:52:09.521 --> 01:52:10.360
learning everything.

1923
01:52:10.360 --> 01:52:14.950
Takedowns lay kicks off and you ever develop kicks the way someone who's like a

1924
01:52:14.951 --> 01:52:18.670
real high level taekwondo practitioner does,
but those taekwondo guys,

1925
01:52:18.850 --> 01:52:20.710
they have so many holes in their games because of that,

1926
01:52:20.711 --> 01:52:22.390
and this is the same thing with karate guys,

1927
01:52:22.780 --> 01:52:26.890
but that skill that these guys have of being able to touch each other the first,

1928
01:52:27.150 --> 01:52:31.960
I mean if you add all that other stuff,
like venom page has add submissions,

1929
01:52:31.961 --> 01:52:36.940
Adelaide kicks,
saddle it,
then you got a crazy combination.
Yeah,
that's,

1930
01:52:36.990 --> 01:52:38.440
that's part of what we've,

1931
01:52:38.530 --> 01:52:41.590
we've had a lot of success with in our striking is that,
yeah,
Moyie Thai,

1932
01:52:41.591 --> 01:52:45.140
but at the end of the day,
our boxing is,
we'll box,
it's western boxing,
you know,

1933
01:52:45.141 --> 01:52:46.220
we'll do Dutch combos.

1934
01:52:46.220 --> 01:52:50.780
<v 3>We'll do Thai clinch tie elbows.
Um,
but we'll also adapt our striking for MMA.</v>

1935
01:52:50.781 --> 01:52:55.750
And most Moitai coaches aren't really thinking how,
you know,
the MMA,

1936
01:52:55.810 --> 01:53:00.020
like you don't throw lake kicks when somebody is coming forward in an MMA fight,

1937
01:53:00.050 --> 01:53:02.510
you're going to get taken down.
They have to be backing up.

1938
01:53:02.511 --> 01:53:03.890
You have to stop them with something.

1939
01:53:04.220 --> 01:53:09.080
Most Thai coaches aren't going to go out of their way to learn the sport of MMA

1940
01:53:09.500 --> 01:53:14.000
to become an effective and an a striker,
right?
Cause all I'm more like,
like Saki.

1941
01:53:14.780 --> 01:53:19.550
Listen,
I know his,
uh,
uh,
round trees coach Jason Park,
um,

1942
01:53:19.580 --> 01:53:22.220
who's,
uh,
out of boxing works with Bryan Pope,
joy,

1943
01:53:22.250 --> 01:53:27.250
tremendous gym down here in southern California and go,

1944
01:53:27.480 --> 01:53:31.520
gone throws that blind light kick and he throws it from that side and it leaves

1945
01:53:31.521 --> 01:53:34.280
his head open.
They plan for that.
That was a planned counter.

1946
01:53:34.280 --> 01:53:35.750
That wasn't just luck of the draw.

1947
01:53:36.170 --> 01:53:40.400
That's an MMA coach with a solid Moyie Thai background.
Who's understanding,

1948
01:53:40.790 --> 01:53:44.630
um,
understanding,
striking for MMA versus someone like,
Oh God,
who again,

1949
01:53:45.320 --> 01:53:47.420
one of the best strikers to ever be in the UFC.

1950
01:53:47.840 --> 01:53:52.400
Who hasn't really adapted unlike a cro cop to MMA yet?

1951
01:53:52.490 --> 01:53:56.060
Well it's also go Kahn came into the UFC with how many fights?

1952
01:53:56.450 --> 01:53:59.530
I mean how many fights is that guy had and kickboxing times.

1953
01:54:00.500 --> 01:54:03.490
But how many MMA fights?
It was like,
oh one he came in.
Yeah,

1954
01:54:03.740 --> 01:54:06.830
I think he was all in one.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And that,
that's,
you know,

1955
01:54:06.910 --> 01:54:09.290
you'll get that a lot with people like Jermaine when,

1956
01:54:09.380 --> 01:54:11.480
when I first started training Germain de Randamie,

1957
01:54:11.780 --> 01:54:13.800
I'm the one that brought her over here.
She was owned one.

1958
01:54:13.820 --> 01:54:17.480
She got her arm broken by Vanessa Porto in a Florida fight.
Right.

1959
01:54:17.510 --> 01:54:21.140
And how are you pronouncing her last name?
Day Run.
Dommy is that all she says it?

1960
01:54:21.170 --> 01:54:23.360
Yeah.
Cause everybody says Deronn to me.
Yeah,
no,

1961
01:54:23.480 --> 01:54:26.020
they run dommy I've heard to say they're in dummy.
Yeah.

1962
01:54:26.270 --> 01:54:30.090
She just lets you still say it how they want,
but why did she decide enough?

1963
01:54:30.130 --> 01:54:31.910
Fight Cyborg.
What,
what was that all about?

1964
01:54:31.920 --> 01:54:35.900
Because she wanted a title beat Holly Holm and then said,
yeah,
you know,

1965
01:54:35.901 --> 01:54:40.490
fuck that.
I'm not dying.
That steroid sheet is basically what she said.

1966
01:54:40.491 --> 01:54:41.810
She called her a steroid sheet.

1967
01:54:42.740 --> 01:54:46.550
You're going to say what you're going to say in the moment.
Right.
So,
Eh,
you know,

1968
01:54:46.551 --> 01:54:49.100
when she,
when I met her,
she was,
she was Oh,
and one,

1969
01:54:49.101 --> 01:54:53.970
she was like the most dominant female kick boxer of all time,
dude.
Yeah,

1970
01:54:54.930 --> 01:54:56.980
absolutely.
I did.
Yeah.
The Dude,

1971
01:54:58.190 --> 01:55:01.910
she was training with the Sean Tompkins and then Sean passed away and her

1972
01:55:01.911 --> 01:55:05.340
manager at the time said,
hey,
she needs a place to go.
So brought her over.
Uh,

1973
01:55:05.341 --> 01:55:10.250
we met and uh,
helped her get her visa.
I got her signed with Strikeforce and uh,

1974
01:55:10.340 --> 01:55:11.900
uh,
she thought of that plate women.
Yeah,

1975
01:55:11.901 --> 01:55:15.200
it did a few different things in her and Miriam never really got along.

1976
01:55:15.590 --> 01:55:18.830
So I could see early on,
her and Miriam never sparred.

1977
01:55:19.580 --> 01:55:20.780
They drilled a couple of times,

1978
01:55:20.781 --> 01:55:24.860
never sparked once while I had both of them at the gym.
That seems kind of crazy.

1979
01:55:25.280 --> 01:55:28.280
Well then we're going to fast forward that over to the Cyborg thing at the end

1980
01:55:28.281 --> 01:55:29.640
of the day.
Um,

1981
01:55:29.750 --> 01:55:34.750
I feel like in that moment Jermaine achieved what she wanted to achieve and for

1982
01:55:35.601 --> 01:55:38.090
whatever reason,
whoever was advising her at the time,

1983
01:55:38.660 --> 01:55:40.070
I think she should have taken that fight.

1984
01:55:40.071 --> 01:55:42.080
I think she should have done that fight.
She wasn't with me at the time.

1985
01:55:42.081 --> 01:55:44.040
I can't judge what Cyborg.
Fine.
Yeah.

1986
01:55:44.040 --> 01:55:47.820
<v 0>That's not what she had an injury apparently turned thumb.
And she,
she said,</v>

1987
01:55:47.910 --> 01:55:49.760
I interviewed her after the Holly Holm fight.
Judge,

1988
01:55:49.800 --> 01:55:51.540
you need to get surgery on her thumb.
Correct.

1989
01:55:51.660 --> 01:55:56.310
But then she changed the story later and said she's never going to fight Cyborg.

1990
01:55:57.610 --> 01:56:02.400
I don't understand that.
I mean,
but you,
you,
if you're going to call her a cheat,

1991
01:56:02.401 --> 01:56:05.370
okay.
She was a cheap before you even went to the hundred 45 pound division,

1992
01:56:05.371 --> 01:56:07.690
you knew who inevitably this is what was gonna happen.
Right.

1993
01:56:07.710 --> 01:56:11.730
So I questioned that as a person.
Nice girl.
You know,

1994
01:56:11.880 --> 01:56:14.460
what do you think it is then?
I mean,

1995
01:56:14.790 --> 01:56:17.760
the only thing that I would say is she doesn't want to fight her because she

1996
01:56:17.761 --> 01:56:21.360
doesn't think she could beat her.
I think that,

1997
01:56:21.960 --> 01:56:26.300
I definitely think that that's got to be in somebody's head.
I can't say not,

1998
01:56:26.320 --> 01:56:30.930
but I can't say that it
not be,

1999
01:56:31.290 --> 01:56:32.460
she's fucking take when they,

2000
01:56:32.580 --> 01:56:34.800
like when they presented the Cyborg fight to me from Miriam,

2001
01:56:34.801 --> 01:56:39.100
I said yes right away.
I said,
yes,
we'll do it in kickboxing in Moitai.
Yes.

2002
01:56:39.270 --> 01:56:42.540
I would not have said yes and MMA.
It just would not have,

2003
01:56:42.900 --> 01:56:46.890
it's not going to go well.
It's,
it's just not for someone like that.

2004
01:56:46.891 --> 01:56:50.670
And Jermaine does not have enough experience in MMA.

2005
01:56:50.671 --> 01:56:55.020
If Jermaine is on her back,
she's not getting up.
She's just not.

2006
01:56:55.120 --> 01:56:58.560
Amanda Nunez showed that people show that she doesn't have that skill yet.
Right.

2007
01:56:58.740 --> 01:57:02.820
So just say,
Hey,
I'm not ready for this yet.
Maybe.
I don't know.

2008
01:57:02.880 --> 01:57:07.080
I can't say that when you're the world champion yet it,
I,
but I,
so how she,

2009
01:57:07.081 --> 01:57:09.750
she hasn't fought since,
since she beat Holly.

2010
01:57:09.760 --> 01:57:12.870
So she's talking about fighting again and like I said,
we're,
we're friendly.

2011
01:57:12.871 --> 01:57:16.410
I mean we,
you know,
there's no bad blood.
It just wasn't that thumb fixed.

2012
01:57:16.620 --> 01:57:20.190
I believe she did.
Yeah.
Yeah,
yeah.
There's just,
it wasn't a good fit for the gym,

2013
01:57:20.670 --> 01:57:24.900
you know,
for,
for her and I,
but she again,
she's still under contract.

2014
01:57:24.900 --> 01:57:27.390
She got the surgery.
Um,
I wish her,
well,

2015
01:57:27.391 --> 01:57:29.850
I think she's going back to 35 from what I understand.

2016
01:57:30.030 --> 01:57:34.380
If she can go to 35 she should because Cyborg camp.

2017
01:57:35.600 --> 01:57:40.600
So you seen that video of her cutting weight to sit next to her before I've

2018
01:57:40.741 --> 01:57:45.150
shook her hand.
She's gigantic.
She weighs a buck 85 if she weighs a pound.

2019
01:57:45.510 --> 01:57:47.580
I mean she's,
she's walking around very,

2020
01:57:47.581 --> 01:57:51.330
very heavy and thick and so she obviously died down,

2021
01:57:51.540 --> 01:57:55.530
gets into like one 70 pound range diets down a little bit more,

2022
01:57:55.531 --> 01:58:00.531
gets into one 65 pound range and then begins the dehydration process.

2023
01:58:00.781 --> 01:58:04.680
But she is fucking enormous when she gets into that cage.
Yeah.

2024
01:58:04.860 --> 01:58:09.330
Then the problem is California with that 10% rule,
there's no way she makes it,

2025
01:58:09.360 --> 01:58:13.470
there's no way she makes that.
I think that is just a recommendation though.

2026
01:58:13.490 --> 01:58:17.430
The first time it's a work sheet.
There's a couple of guys that uh,

2027
01:58:17.790 --> 01:58:21.360
the weight in the next day like heavier than the 10% and they would be

2028
01:58:21.361 --> 01:58:24.180
interested in,
didn't she fight in California though after the rule?

2029
01:58:24.450 --> 01:58:26.110
It will be interesting to know what she weighed in at all.

2030
01:58:26.150 --> 01:58:28.710
So that's very interesting because they don't give that information out.

2031
01:58:28.711 --> 01:58:33.260
I wish they would like boxing does like Hbo.
They'll show you read the cow.
Yeah,

2032
01:58:33.300 --> 01:58:35.280
that's,
that's cool.
I read the California,

2033
01:58:35.340 --> 01:58:39.090
I read yesterday that California was going to start releasing the fight day

2034
01:58:39.091 --> 01:58:39.924
weights.

2035
01:58:40.060 --> 01:58:44.830
Like foster that guy who's the head of the California State Athletic Commission.

2036
01:58:45.100 --> 01:58:48.070
He's on the ball.
That guy is on the ball.

2037
01:58:48.071 --> 01:58:52.960
He's so ahead of the curve and with all that Shit with implementation of

2038
01:58:52.961 --> 01:58:55.280
additional weight classes with uh,

2039
01:58:55.330 --> 01:59:00.130
with like catching people doing steroids with just,
I love that guy.

2040
01:59:00.131 --> 01:59:01.660
I'm a big fan.
No,
Andy.

2041
01:59:01.660 --> 01:59:06.580
Andy has been great for the sport in California and know when people talk about,

2042
01:59:06.581 --> 01:59:08.980
Oh,
Dana is going to change the way in times and this and this and this.

2043
01:59:09.340 --> 01:59:14.090
I don't believe that Andy Foster would let that happen in his lifetime with,

2044
01:59:14.140 --> 01:59:15.040
here's what I think.

2045
01:59:15.070 --> 01:59:17.770
If you're going to have this way in thing early in the morning,

2046
01:59:18.220 --> 01:59:21.170
let them weigh in all day till the fucking limit to,

2047
01:59:21.171 --> 01:59:23.920
if it's four o'clock in the afternoon where they're supposed to weigh in,

2048
01:59:24.160 --> 01:59:27.150
have it cut it off at three 30 so you know for sure whether or not someone's

2049
01:59:27.160 --> 01:59:28.980
going to make it,
but the problem is you,

2050
01:59:28.981 --> 01:59:31.450
you wake up at eight o'clock in the morning,
you only have two hours.

2051
01:59:31.790 --> 01:59:36.040
You're that's not the same as being able to do it all throughout the day where

2052
01:59:36.041 --> 01:59:39.520
your body would normally just lose a little bit of weight anyway.
It changes,

2053
01:59:39.521 --> 01:59:42.730
it changes everything.
That timing and that's,
that's where you know,

2054
01:59:42.731 --> 01:59:44.590
you look at the numbers,
it was like,
oh you know,

2055
01:59:44.591 --> 01:59:46.750
two year span before they changed the timing.

2056
01:59:46.780 --> 01:59:49.210
X amount of people missed weight to your span sense.

2057
01:59:49.211 --> 01:59:51.460
This many people in this bullshit,
they do push,

2058
01:59:51.640 --> 01:59:54.550
you give him more time and they are going to push it if they know that they can

2059
01:59:54.551 --> 01:59:55.510
rehydrate longer,

2060
01:59:55.511 --> 01:59:59.740
which is the idea is that it's safer because you can rehydrate from 8:00 AM to

2061
01:59:59.741 --> 02:00:02.770
4:00 PM instead of,
you know from 4:00 PM on.

2062
02:00:03.250 --> 02:00:06.490
I just think that give them all the time they need,
you know,

2063
02:00:06.491 --> 02:00:11.080
and fuck one fcs laid out the groundwork.

2064
02:00:11.370 --> 02:00:16.120
Just look at what they did with their rehydration tests and or hydration test

2065
02:00:16.121 --> 02:00:18.880
rather.
And implement cutting weight is just silly.

2066
02:00:18.881 --> 02:00:21.190
Like I was talking to my girlfriend about it and she was like,
wait,
wait,

2067
02:00:21.610 --> 02:00:25.060
you guys,
she didn't know much about fighting at the time,
you know,
obviously,

2068
02:00:25.061 --> 02:00:29.620
but she was like,
you guys make this weight but the next day you're not.

2069
02:00:29.650 --> 02:00:33.770
You're not the same way,
so why not just not weigh in?
Yeah,

2070
02:00:33.771 --> 02:00:37.120
I guess stupid.
It's just like,
it sounds really stupid.

2071
02:00:37.121 --> 02:00:40.270
That's not what you find that it's sanction cheating.
Yeah.

2072
02:00:40.320 --> 02:00:44.050
Sanction cheating is cheating at a much higher scale even than PDS.

2073
02:00:44.200 --> 02:00:49.170
If you get two people when they both weigh one 35 but they're both,
uh,

2074
02:00:49.330 --> 02:00:49.721
you know,

2075
02:00:49.721 --> 02:00:53.530
they're both totally hydrated and one of them has been doing steroids and one of

2076
02:00:53.531 --> 02:00:54.670
them hasn't been doing steroids.

2077
02:00:54.820 --> 02:00:59.820
The difference will be far less than if one person weighs in at one 35 but then

2078
02:01:00.551 --> 02:01:05.551
balloons up to one 60 and then gets into that octagon at one 60.

2079
02:01:06.070 --> 02:01:10.450
But there's no PDDs involved.
Well,
that's a much greater advantage.
Well,

2080
02:01:10.451 --> 02:01:14.050
someone who's doing some,
some sort of a testosterone thing or something,

2081
02:01:14.180 --> 02:01:18.730
especially with the,
with more time now to rehydrate,
it's still not enough time.

2082
02:01:18.770 --> 02:01:20.680
Right,
right.
You know,
the 48 hours,
you know,

2083
02:01:20.681 --> 02:01:22.390
whatever the current is compromised there,

2084
02:01:22.420 --> 02:01:26.650
you're absolutely cost the benefit might outweigh the benefit of being so much

2085
02:01:26.651 --> 02:01:29.940
larger might outweigh being compromised.
Oh,
absolutely.
And B,

2086
02:01:30.010 --> 02:01:32.510
and if you look at the previous record,
it was,
you know,

2087
02:01:32.530 --> 02:01:34.120
a losing record for fighters that Miss,

2088
02:01:34.121 --> 02:01:36.910
wait when it was a five o'clock way in and now it's a winning record for

2089
02:01:36.911 --> 02:01:40.070
fighters that Ms. Wade and an 11:00 AM Wayne because they have more time

2090
02:01:40.070 --> 02:01:44.510
<v 2>to recover.
Dude,
if I running shit,
I would fix that first.</v>

2091
02:01:44.540 --> 02:01:46.100
That would be the first thing I would fix.

2092
02:01:46.130 --> 02:01:51.130
The next thing I'd fix is judging the idea that you have wind bonus and loss

2093
02:01:51.481 --> 02:01:56.000
bonus,
but you haven't fixed the fucking judging his God damn crazy.

2094
02:01:56.260 --> 02:01:57.430
It's crazy.

2095
02:01:57.431 --> 02:02:01.790
It I just throw my hands up sometimes now I can't even say anything anymore

2096
02:02:01.791 --> 02:02:05.050
because I've had so many rants about it and they've gone nowhere.

2097
02:02:05.110 --> 02:02:05.990
Nothing gets done,

2098
02:02:05.991 --> 02:02:09.890
and you still have people that literally have never applied an Armbar in their

2099
02:02:09.891 --> 02:02:13.250
life.
They've never taken a punch in the face in their life.

2100
02:02:13.400 --> 02:02:17.510
They've never thrown a kick in competition in their life and they're judging

2101
02:02:17.511 --> 02:02:21.380
these fights and they don't even train.
I mean,
even forget competition.

2102
02:02:21.530 --> 02:02:24.320
Just fucking have a love of the sport.

2103
02:02:24.321 --> 02:02:27.200
They don't even have a love of the support.
They're just doing it as a job.

2104
02:02:27.230 --> 02:02:28.280
It's crazy.

2105
02:02:28.520 --> 02:02:33.020
It is crazy when you have a limited supply or an unlimited rather,

2106
02:02:33.021 --> 02:02:36.860
an unlimited supply of people who are martial arts experts who would make

2107
02:02:36.861 --> 02:02:41.540
fantastic judges all throughout the world.
You have so many thousands of them.

2108
02:02:41.541 --> 02:02:45.440
Yeah.
I mean,
how many fucking people are giant martial arts fans that are on,

2109
02:02:45.620 --> 02:02:49.490
whether it's sure dog or mixed martial arts.com or you know,

2110
02:02:49.491 --> 02:02:51.650
fill in the name of the website.

2111
02:02:51.860 --> 02:02:56.860
There's so many people that are in engrossed in martial arts all day long.

2112
02:02:57.531 --> 02:02:58.610
That's what they live for.

2113
02:02:58.840 --> 02:03:03.530
And they Jill debate whether or not so Hutto should a one round two or mighty

2114
02:03:03.531 --> 02:03:05.420
mouse show wanted with effective striking.

2115
02:03:05.421 --> 02:03:08.090
And there's like this real comprehensive conversation going on.

2116
02:03:08.420 --> 02:03:11.390
These people that are judging the fight can even have that conversation.

2117
02:03:11.600 --> 02:03:14.170
If you had a conversation with half the fucking UFC judges.

2118
02:03:14.180 --> 02:03:17.750
If I had them here and I sat them down and I said,
you know,
let's,

2119
02:03:17.751 --> 02:03:20.390
let's watch a fight and you tell me what you is going on here,

2120
02:03:20.570 --> 02:03:24.090
but tell me what you think is better.
Tell me what you think.
How hard,
what,

2121
02:03:24.130 --> 02:03:26.630
what does a low calf kick feel like?
You know what it,

2122
02:03:26.631 --> 02:03:30.500
what does it feel like when you get hit with a liver shot?
You know what,
when,

2123
02:03:30.501 --> 02:03:33.920
when is a guy safe in a triangle and when is he in danger?

2124
02:03:34.010 --> 02:03:37.340
How can you protect yourself?
Who's dom,
who's dominating what position?

2125
02:03:37.750 --> 02:03:41.540
What does a guy just laying on top to breathe and the rest and the third round

2126
02:03:41.870 --> 02:03:44.510
or when they're,
they like doing damage.
Recognize,

2127
02:03:44.540 --> 02:03:46.220
can you recognize the progression?

2128
02:03:46.370 --> 02:03:49.370
Do you understand what a guy has to do to get out of the out of the guard?

2129
02:03:49.400 --> 02:03:52.220
Do you understand what a guy has to do to escape from an arm triangle?

2130
02:03:52.400 --> 02:03:53.060
If you don't,

2131
02:03:53.060 --> 02:03:58.060
you have no fucking business putting these guys livelihoods and their records

2132
02:03:59.300 --> 02:04:04.190
and literally half their earning.
You have no business.
Half the fucking money.

2133
02:04:04.370 --> 02:04:05.030
If you have a,

2134
02:04:05.030 --> 02:04:10.030
if you're getting 50 and 50 this motherfucker costs you $50,000 by not knowing

2135
02:04:10.101 --> 02:04:13.550
anything.
That is insane to me.
That should be fixed.

2136
02:04:13.730 --> 02:04:15.320
And why is there three judges?

2137
02:04:15.350 --> 02:04:18.950
Why three says who cause boxing's always done it that way.

2138
02:04:18.951 --> 02:04:21.860
What do we fucking copycats?
That doesn't make any sense.

2139
02:04:21.950 --> 02:04:24.320
We should have five and have five judges.

2140
02:04:25.070 --> 02:04:28.610
You have a much greater chance of getting it right with five judges.

2141
02:04:28.790 --> 02:04:32.150
Have five judges.
Make these motherfuckers take tests.
First of all,
that's,

2142
02:04:32.180 --> 02:04:36.260
that's one thing.
Second,
why 10 point must system.
What the fuck is that?

2143
02:04:36.410 --> 02:04:37.620
That's some boxing shit.

2144
02:04:37.740 --> 02:04:41.400
Why are you using a boxing scoring system for something that involves takedown

2145
02:04:41.430 --> 02:04:46.050
submissions,
leg kicks,
punches,
elbows,
knees.
Like there's too many things.

2146
02:04:46.051 --> 02:04:48.720
There's way too many things.
It's,
it's a crazy system.

2147
02:04:48.990 --> 02:04:53.320
<v 1>Absolutely.
This is what I get the,
the most,
the discussions for Moy Tai.</v>

2148
02:04:53.700 --> 02:04:57.310
It's the same thing.
That means it's the same exact same exact problem.

2149
02:04:57.380 --> 02:05:00.480
Same problem.
It's not there.
You know,
what's,
what's worth more?

2150
02:05:00.481 --> 02:05:04.290
What's not worth putting judge in Thailand?
Um,
well it,
it depends.

2151
02:05:04.291 --> 02:05:08.520
Now in Thailand they're starting to just kind of score things evenly cause

2152
02:05:08.521 --> 02:05:11.400
they're wanting to get to just three,
three minute rounds.
Yeah.
They want to do,

2153
02:05:11.760 --> 02:05:14.160
they want Muay Thai in the Olympics.
Right?

2154
02:05:14.161 --> 02:05:19.161
So you can't score the body kick more than a leg kick in the Olympics.

2155
02:05:19.591 --> 02:05:22.170
Right.
The weapons have to be equal is what they want from the,

2156
02:05:22.230 --> 02:05:25.350
the International Olympic Committee.
And also cause it used to be like,
oh,

2157
02:05:25.560 --> 02:05:28.890
you know,
I've been to Thailand three times and I'll go to Lund,

2158
02:05:28.891 --> 02:05:32.160
piney or Raja and you know,
these guys were like,

2159
02:05:32.280 --> 02:05:33.710
and sometimes it would be foreigners.

2160
02:05:33.770 --> 02:05:37.440
Frank's fighting against ties and like there was like punch and you know,

2161
02:05:37.441 --> 02:05:39.180
and do all this low cakes and stuff like that.

2162
02:05:39.181 --> 02:05:41.310
And then [inaudible] with two body kicks in,

2163
02:05:41.370 --> 02:05:46.120
they'll win the round because the body kit scores more.
Right.
And the tie score,

2164
02:05:46.121 --> 02:05:50.070
I mean it's designed for gambling,
right?
So it's,
it's one of those things where,

2165
02:05:50.280 --> 02:05:52.950
you know,
people scream,
it's not traditional ties,
not traditional Thai.

2166
02:05:52.951 --> 02:05:55.050
It's not traditional Thai.
At the end of the day,

2167
02:05:55.051 --> 02:05:56.550
no one's saying that traditional ties,
right.

2168
02:05:56.580 --> 02:05:59.760
Either the body kicks should not be worth more than a punch to the mouth.

2169
02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:04.270
I believe they've changed it now they have everything.
Everything else.

2170
02:06:04.271 --> 02:06:09.120
This is damage damage,
right?
Hard shot.
It's hard shots versus,
you know,

2171
02:06:09.330 --> 02:06:13.410
but isn't that subjective?
Like what is a hard shot and what's not a harsh?
It is.

2172
02:06:13.470 --> 02:06:16.200
It is here,
but especially because it's the ABC,

2173
02:06:17.040 --> 02:06:19.350
Adelaide bird judged Kevin's fight with your motto.

2174
02:06:20.640 --> 02:06:24.120
She did so,
yeah.
Nice Lady.

2175
02:06:25.590 --> 02:06:28.920
That's what I was saying about Adelaide.
Nice Lady.
Yeah,
that's it.

2176
02:06:29.360 --> 02:06:32.450
I always smile when I see here.
It was like a load.
I remember that.

2177
02:06:33.040 --> 02:06:36.570
Or remember that fight drives me crazy though.
Yeah,
and literally it's my,

2178
02:06:36.630 --> 02:06:39.570
my opinion is that she gave the fight to your model because I guarantee you she

2179
02:06:39.571 --> 02:06:42.030
didn't know that elbows were supposed to mean more just because Kevin was

2180
02:06:42.031 --> 02:06:46.230
bleeding and that's all she could see.
I remember it was my 21st birthday.

2181
02:06:46.231 --> 02:06:50.910
I walked,
I walked off because I thought Kevin One and then I'm like,
wait,

2182
02:06:50.911 --> 02:06:53.490
what just happened?
Yeah.
Literally there was one around where,

2183
02:06:53.580 --> 02:06:57.390
I mean there was one round where he threw seven body left,

2184
02:06:57.391 --> 02:07:02.130
body left body kicks in,
a row answered,
just boom,
boom,
boom,

2185
02:07:02.340 --> 02:07:06.750
boom,
boom,
boom.
And he had some blood on him and he lost the fight.
I mean,

2186
02:07:07.260 --> 02:07:08.093
what are you going to do?

2187
02:07:08.210 --> 02:07:12.890
<v 2>Yeah.
Unreal.
Yeah.
It's unfortunate and it's,
it's,</v>

2188
02:07:13.010 --> 02:07:17.030
it's not this the,
here's the thing I've been saying this forever.

2189
02:07:17.060 --> 02:07:20.840
Nothing changes.
Yeah.
You know what?
I was really surprised at this past weekend,

2190
02:07:21.040 --> 02:07:22.520
I was talking to Daniel Cormier and I said,

2191
02:07:22.730 --> 02:07:26.480
I think the stupidest fucking rule is that 12 to six elbow,
and he said,

2192
02:07:26.481 --> 02:07:29.180
I like that rule.
And I said,
really?
I said,

2193
02:07:29.181 --> 02:07:32.020
you don't think that 12 to six elbow should be legal.
He goes,

2194
02:07:32.040 --> 02:07:35.030
you ever get hit by a 12 and six elbow on the ground?
I said,
no,
I haven't.

2195
02:07:35.440 --> 02:07:36.040
And he said

2196
02:07:36.040 --> 02:07:37.630
<v 0>he didn't believe me,
man.
It sucks.
I go,</v>

2197
02:07:37.631 --> 02:07:39.950
but doesn't every elbow on the ground suck?
Yeah.

2198
02:07:40.210 --> 02:07:43.340
I mean I would think that just getting hit this way,
you know,
just a,

2199
02:07:43.341 --> 02:07:47.400
a regular elbow sucks on the ground.
Your head's planted.

2200
02:07:47.530 --> 02:07:49.190
You're not going anywhere.
You're just taking these,

2201
02:07:49.360 --> 02:07:51.590
it isn't legal and Moitai either from,

2202
02:07:51.620 --> 02:07:55.360
from the clinch when you're going 12 to six I believe.
Not Legal.
No,
no,
no.

2203
02:07:55.390 --> 02:07:56.800
It's not like you can in the air.
Right.

2204
02:07:56.801 --> 02:08:01.801
You can jump up in the u s in the u s the 12 to six elbow because it's ABC.

2205
02:08:03.380 --> 02:08:06.700
Just he,
a video of him leaping through the air,

2206
02:08:06.910 --> 02:08:08.890
literally climbing the tree,

2207
02:08:08.920 --> 02:08:11.710
elbowing someone in the back of the head with it and he's like,

2208
02:08:11.711 --> 02:08:14.770
this doesn't count because when you're in the air,
digital becomes analog.

2209
02:08:14.771 --> 02:08:18.760
He sent me,
this is ridiculous.
I saw that.
I saw that explanation.
Miriam's fight,

2210
02:08:18.761 --> 02:08:22.570
and if my,
she ended up getting her fight.
She was the gold medal fight.

2211
02:08:22.571 --> 02:08:25.960
She ended up getting it moved to the king's Cup at the,

2212
02:08:25.961 --> 02:08:29.980
this was happening at the same time as the world championships just because she

2213
02:08:29.981 --> 02:08:34.170
was landing so many 12 to six flying elbows on girls.

2214
02:08:34.180 --> 02:08:37.590
They'd never seen it from a woman before and she was going crazy.
Yeah,

2215
02:08:37.630 --> 02:08:40.480
I mean literally just flying with,
just across the ring,

2216
02:08:40.481 --> 02:08:44.230
just chopping girls down with 12 to six elbows.
Her performance,

2217
02:08:44.560 --> 02:08:47.020
that was like Oh nine that performance on that.

2218
02:08:47.021 --> 02:08:50.470
He just run through girls like scary and that 12 to six elbow,

2219
02:08:51.160 --> 02:08:52.300
it's no more dangerous.

2220
02:08:52.301 --> 02:08:56.200
The most dangerous elbow and all of a combat sports as a spinning elbow.

2221
02:08:56.350 --> 02:08:57.183
That's the most dangerous.

2222
02:08:59.650 --> 02:09:02.600
How the fuck could it 12 to six elbow would be more powerful than other.

2223
02:09:02.601 --> 02:09:05.560
There's no,
there's no more dangerous elbow.
A Tyler toner,

2224
02:09:05.561 --> 02:09:09.390
the kid that he landed it on first,
the Dwayne's kid,
uh,
he is a pseudo veteran.

2225
02:09:09.391 --> 02:09:12.520
He's a UFC veteran.
It wouldn't cause a horrible broken orbital.
He retired.

2226
02:09:12.521 --> 02:09:17.440
I mean never fought again because I started to sink into it has to put a plate

2227
02:09:17.470 --> 02:09:18.970
on the bottom.
Cause yeah,

2228
02:09:19.780 --> 02:09:23.110
the broken orbital was so weird because oftentimes it changed the way the eye

2229
02:09:23.111 --> 02:09:27.070
looks like.
You remember when Bob Sapp well,
I think he has a lazy eye now.
Yeah,

2230
02:09:27.080 --> 02:09:30.190
he does not cro.
Cop Broke Bob saps eyeball.

2231
02:09:30.550 --> 02:09:34.690
Like he punched his eyeball through the back of his head where the orbital,

2232
02:09:34.691 --> 02:09:38.350
you know,
there's a,
there's a hole right where the eyeballs sits.

2233
02:09:38.351 --> 02:09:41.980
Like you see that thing?
Yeah.
He was fractured behind it.

2234
02:09:42.160 --> 02:09:45.070
And so now Bob's got one eye that's bays and whatnot.

2235
02:09:45.100 --> 02:09:49.180
It's little from getting tagged by Cro cop.
The 12 to six elbow.

2236
02:09:49.360 --> 02:09:51.310
It has no more effect than any other,

2237
02:09:51.550 --> 02:09:54.760
the straight left hand with boxing gloves on.

2238
02:09:54.970 --> 02:09:59.890
That's how hard cro cop hits.
Yeah.
Think about that shit.
It was a bad dude man.

2239
02:09:59.891 --> 02:10:03.440
Yeah,
he was a bad motherfucker until it still is.
And um,

2240
02:10:03.880 --> 02:10:08.410
the thing though is that it just,
it just doesn't make any sense to me that like,

2241
02:10:08.620 --> 02:10:11.830
like here's one that people are trying to,
to say that should be banned,

2242
02:10:11.860 --> 02:10:16.780
that side kick to the knee or the oblique kick to the knee.
That,
how has that,

2243
02:10:16.810 --> 02:10:20.530
why would you ban that?
We don't ban heel hooks.
Like that seems crazy to me.

2244
02:10:20.680 --> 02:10:23.710
Why would you ban that?
What you don't ban wheel kicks?
Like,

2245
02:10:23.711 --> 02:10:28.630
it's okay to literally bounce your heel off someone's head when you're spinning

2246
02:10:28.631 --> 02:10:33.631
your body around like a top and you have unbelievable power,

2247
02:10:33.830 --> 02:10:34.110
like

2248
02:10:34.110 --> 02:10:35.000
<v 2>a wheel kick.
Like,</v>

2249
02:10:35.001 --> 02:10:38.660
remember that when Terry Adam got knocked out by Edson Barboza like God,
he just,

2250
02:10:38.700 --> 02:10:40.050
he,
oh,

2251
02:10:40.080 --> 02:10:43.940
the air and just drop it was literally like someone hit his switch.

2252
02:10:43.990 --> 02:10:47.990
Just might be the best like spinning kick I've seen it was the first ever we'll

2253
02:10:47.991 --> 02:10:52.190
kick Keoni UFC.
Yeah,
and I mean we've,
we've had a few since then,

2254
02:10:52.191 --> 02:10:56.300
but it's just not such a crazy technique.
Yeah.
You got that.
Here it is.

2255
02:10:56.330 --> 02:11:00.140
Watch this rose and put it on the commentary

2256
02:11:03.850 --> 02:11:08.480
that was literally saying take a chance and risk getting knocked out.

2257
02:11:08.780 --> 02:11:13.150
And Terry,
Adam got knocked out.
Yeah.
I mean that shit was borrows on,
man.

2258
02:11:13.151 --> 02:11:15.050
It was a bad dude.
He's a bad motherfucker.

2259
02:11:15.080 --> 02:11:19.160
One of my favorite fights of him was when he fought.
Oh,
at the end Jack Wani.
Oh,

2260
02:11:19.161 --> 02:11:22.490
that's fine.
That was a great fight.
That was,

2261
02:11:22.690 --> 02:11:25.420
I think that's my favorite stand up fight.
Quan.

2262
02:11:25.590 --> 02:11:30.150
He's just such a great kick boxer himself.
Muay Thai fighter.
He's doing now.
He's,

2263
02:11:30.260 --> 02:11:33.590
he's,
his last fight was Moyie Thai,
so he's all my time now.

2264
02:11:33.591 --> 02:11:36.710
He's always doing that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He,
he won.
He won the triumphant.

2265
02:11:36.830 --> 02:11:41.170
Is his brother Moy Thai fighting as well?
He's a cutie Chitty is doing,
uh,

2266
02:11:41.390 --> 02:11:45.460
I think he cheated.
Might be in that tournament.
It was he,
who is he?
I don't know.

2267
02:11:45.480 --> 02:11:48.800
No Chinese seem to bind you sign with Bella tour.
No,
but he's not making one 78.

2268
02:11:49.220 --> 02:11:54.220
He's fighting one 85 this Bella toward doing Michael Page versus a Semtex Paul

2269
02:11:55.251 --> 02:11:58.870
daily.
Are they going to do that?
Yeah,
they're doing it.
They're doing.

2270
02:11:58.890 --> 02:12:03.620
And then they're in opposite brackets of a Musashi and uh oh good Lord.

2271
02:12:03.980 --> 02:12:08.210
Beltour reveals a welter weight tournament bracket including Michael Page versus

2272
02:12:08.211 --> 02:12:13.120
Paul Daley.
So page versus dailies on one side and this side is Musashi.

2273
02:12:13.130 --> 02:12:17.300
Got To fight at one 70.
Wait a minute,
that's not real,
right?

2274
02:12:18.060 --> 02:12:21.890
[inaudible] he's fighting once.
No,
Rory is going up to fight.

2275
02:12:21.891 --> 02:12:23.360
Musashi just announced today.
Okay.

2276
02:12:23.540 --> 02:12:27.290
This is so ori and Musashi up to weight loss is a big one.

2277
02:12:27.291 --> 02:12:31.430
85 or make that larger again so I can see what this is.
This is really strange.

2278
02:12:31.550 --> 02:12:36.160
So what they're doing is they're going to do Rory macdonald is Stan versus
chide.

2279
02:12:36.980 --> 02:12:40.730
So Rory Macdonald's staying in this welterweight Grand Prix as well.

2280
02:12:40.790 --> 02:12:45.790
If I need to do it [inaudible] September 29th then Lorens Larkin's still in the

2281
02:12:47.151 --> 02:12:52.130
mix too.
He's an alternate.
He's a nice man.
Lorens Larkin is a fucking beast.

2282
02:12:52.340 --> 02:12:55.280
You know,
mean he lost to Lima and then he got stopped by daily.
But

2283
02:12:56.820 --> 02:13:00.630
he's a monster and Korskoff man looked.
Did you see that with spinning back kick?

2284
02:13:00.631 --> 02:13:04.870
The korotkoff landed.
He literally sent that dude flying through the air.

2285
02:13:05.720 --> 02:13:08.380
I fought on that card.
That was crazy.
Yeah.

2286
02:13:08.870 --> 02:13:12.890
And Douglas Lema looks like a heavy weight.
It looks like a heavyweight.
Like you.

2287
02:13:12.891 --> 02:13:17.650
Like how the fuck is that guy won 70 he's gotta be one of the bigger weight

2288
02:13:17.651 --> 02:13:20.750
cutters in this sport.
Right?
Absolutely.
See,

2289
02:13:20.751 --> 02:13:23.060
this is what I'm thinking when I'm looking at this.
I'm like,

2290
02:13:23.120 --> 02:13:25.400
this is a really good tournament.

2291
02:13:25.401 --> 02:13:29.720
Like bell tours getting really close when you got lima.

2292
02:13:29.930 --> 02:13:32.580
Who's worldclass?
Korotkoff worldclass

2293
02:13:32.580 --> 02:13:34.950
<v 0>we saw that when he fought Benson Henderson for sure.
Right.</v>

2294
02:13:35.130 --> 02:13:39.510
But Lima stopped him and then he got Paul Daley who literally can stop anybody.

2295
02:13:39.511 --> 02:13:42.680
That motherfucker lands that left hand.
He can put anybody to sleep.

2296
02:13:43.170 --> 02:13:46.830
He knocked out.
It's going to be a banger.
Fuck yeah.

2297
02:13:47.010 --> 02:13:50.580
And Rory Mcdonald who shut Paul Daley Down,
you know,

2298
02:13:50.581 --> 02:13:54.030
and also beat Lima.
And then you got John Fitch,

2299
02:13:54.060 --> 02:13:57.960
who seems are reborn,
you know,
after he beat Paul Daley.

2300
02:13:58.530 --> 02:14:02.220
Very interesting,
right?
It's a good tournament plus very little drug testing.

2301
02:14:05.880 --> 02:14:10.000
We're California based Joe.
We don't know about all that.
Yeah,
fuck man.

2302
02:14:10.910 --> 02:14:15.330
What are you,
what are you talking about?
Yeah,
but it's,
it's fascinating.

2303
02:14:15.331 --> 02:14:18.630
You see the difference between guys in the early days of the UFC when he was the

2304
02:14:18.631 --> 02:14:21.840
wild west versus now.
I mean,
bodies have changed.

2305
02:14:22.200 --> 02:14:26.480
Careers have taken different paths.
Listen,
I'm a,
I'm a fan.
If,

2306
02:14:26.610 --> 02:14:29.540
if it's not legal then it should all be illegal.
And I'm a fan of Usada.

2307
02:14:29.580 --> 02:14:30.740
They visit my gym.
Somebody,

2308
02:14:30.760 --> 02:14:34.680
a poor Lexus has been tested like in two months.

2309
02:14:34.681 --> 02:14:38.120
I think they came up four times.
I asked her so much.
I Dunno.

2310
02:14:39.580 --> 02:14:43.260
Operate on rumors.
Nah,
no,
no.
Alexis,
if you look at Alexis Davis,

2311
02:14:43.261 --> 02:14:45.810
she's not someone that somebody thinks.
Yeah,
that's what I'm saying.

2312
02:14:45.811 --> 02:14:50.370
Like that's why it's just because the Usada rep is very active in that area.

2313
02:14:50.460 --> 02:14:52.440
So they're like,
she's coming.
She's tested.
Todd,

2314
02:14:52.441 --> 02:14:55.230
she's tested Dustin and she's tested Alexis a lot.

2315
02:14:55.800 --> 02:14:59.440
Todd Todd Duffy.
She's tested a lot.

2316
02:14:59.740 --> 02:15:04.230
Todd Duffy was on testosterone replacement at one point in time before my time.

2317
02:15:04.231 --> 02:15:09.180
I believe so.
Well he was when he was like 25 it was,
he wasn't,
yeah,
it wasn't.

2318
02:15:09.330 --> 02:15:12.750
He's,
he's been,
he's been with me now for like the past year.

2319
02:15:12.870 --> 02:15:16.720
I renegotiated his UFC agreement.
I love Todd.
He was fun.
Great Guy.

2320
02:15:16.770 --> 02:15:20.720
Todd Todd as a heavyweight was fighting for like 10 and 10.
Uh,

2321
02:15:21.470 --> 02:15:23.130
well before I renegotiated his deal,

2322
02:15:25.830 --> 02:15:29.520
but he just had shoulder surgery and he just had knee surgery so we're hoping to

2323
02:15:29.521 --> 02:15:34.410
get him.
He had knee surgery.
Yeah.
Aw Man.
It's shoulder and knee surgery.

2324
02:15:34.610 --> 02:15:38.280
He had soldier surgery like six years,
six months ago.
He's still young though,

2325
02:15:38.281 --> 02:15:40.830
right?
You is too.
He's not the,
he's not that old.

2326
02:15:40.831 --> 02:15:44.790
I think mentally he thinks he's a good dude.
Yeah.
I as a heavyweight,

2327
02:15:44.791 --> 02:15:48.540
I can him being heavy with me being the federal way we can train together and

2328
02:15:48.541 --> 02:15:52.460
spar and he's just so controlled and soak in,
so that's awesome.

2329
02:15:52.560 --> 02:15:56.250
So quick for a heavy,
we don't,
we don't spar hard.
Yeah,
we really don't.

2330
02:15:56.370 --> 02:15:59.780
You don't know it don't,
not at all.
No.
The hardest I spar format,
that's fine.

2331
02:15:59.790 --> 02:16:01.740
Was probably when Cody came down there when I went up there.

2332
02:16:01.770 --> 02:16:05.730
That was twice and no we don't,
we don't really know.
I don't have smart heart.

2333
02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:07.710
That is so fucking smart.

2334
02:16:07.711 --> 02:16:11.130
And I love hearing that because I just feel like so many fighters make that

2335
02:16:11.131 --> 02:16:13.950
mistake.
Yeah,
well you covered with a boxing background.

2336
02:16:13.951 --> 02:16:17.040
You spar like three days a week at least to write and you're going,
you know,

2337
02:16:17.190 --> 02:16:21.580
you're going as hard as you can.
Uh,
and then you know,
Eh,
kickboxing,
you know,

2338
02:16:21.581 --> 02:16:23.880
ties.
They don't spar that hard,
but they'll go,
oh well you know,

2339
02:16:23.881 --> 02:16:26.010
they're done fighting or whatever.
But the truth of the matter is,

2340
02:16:26.011 --> 02:16:30.450
is that with all of the weapons that you have in and all the weapons such we're

2341
02:16:30.451 --> 02:16:33.070
having Thai boxing,
you're sparring hard with those weapons.

2342
02:16:33.071 --> 02:16:36.700
The chance of injury is checking through the roof.

2343
02:16:36.760 --> 02:16:39.580
If you're throwing spinning elbows and training,
it's full clip.

2344
02:16:39.600 --> 02:16:40.990
I can show you and I use,

2345
02:16:41.050 --> 02:16:44.230
I use him as the example is other people call them a coach.
If I don't,

2346
02:16:44.410 --> 02:16:47.410
if I don't throw this hard,
how am I going to know that I can land it in a fight?

2347
02:16:47.411 --> 02:16:47.980
Hard.

2348
02:16:47.980 --> 02:16:51.640
Well Guess John's never put anybody down with a spinning elbow in the gym and he

2349
02:16:51.641 --> 02:16:55.720
can land it in a fight and it's bullshit and I can,
I can show it really well,

2350
02:16:55.721 --> 02:17:00.110
like in the gym,
like to the point that I'm like right there and I just stopped.

2351
02:17:00.111 --> 02:17:02.550
I'm like,
I just liked him and I just raised my hand.
I'm like,

2352
02:17:02.620 --> 02:17:05.650
that would have been it.
Most people are looking at,

2353
02:17:05.760 --> 02:17:07.630
mostly people are draining like that.
Ya Know,
we,

2354
02:17:07.631 --> 02:17:11.380
we've never been a hard sparring gets one of the more controversial debates.

2355
02:17:11.410 --> 02:17:14.800
Right.
Whether or not you should spar hard,
it's really the thing you have to,

2356
02:17:14.870 --> 02:17:19.810
I absolutely,
some people thinks you have to,
I disagree with,
for us.
I disagree.

2357
02:17:19.811 --> 02:17:23.910
I listened to the hiring people to try to knock out George.
Yes.
I,
I,

2358
02:17:24.060 --> 02:17:27.880
I get that and uh,
I,
I,
I understand it.

2359
02:17:28.330 --> 02:17:31.630
I don't agree with it.
I just don't,
the human body is fragile,
man.

2360
02:17:31.680 --> 02:17:34.840
The heat of the brain is fragile.
You cannot condition an Oregon.
Right?

2361
02:17:34.841 --> 02:17:38.410
But how can you argue with his success rate?
I mean,
it's really interesting.

2362
02:17:38.411 --> 02:17:42.820
It's like he's Look Aka who the fuck's bars harder than Aka.

2363
02:17:43.030 --> 02:17:45.550
Those guys are animals.
They'd go at each other.
But look,

2364
02:17:45.730 --> 02:17:49.660
Luke Rockhold world champ,
Daniel called me a world champ.

2365
02:17:49.780 --> 02:17:50.770
Cain Velasquez,

2366
02:17:50.771 --> 02:17:55.660
world champ could number Numberg Madoff world champ and a fucking litany of

2367
02:17:55.661 --> 02:17:59.980
assassins just waiting in the wings.
Yeah,
you mean in my opinion,

2368
02:17:59.981 --> 02:18:04.890
succeeding in spite of not because.
Interesting.
Yeah.
Well it's,

2369
02:18:04.891 --> 02:18:08.110
it's certainly a debate and your opinion is very well respected.
And I,

2370
02:18:08.230 --> 02:18:11.800
I am on your side.
I like the idea of,

2371
02:18:12.160 --> 02:18:16.630
I think you know how to fight and what you're really doing is sharpening up
your,

2372
02:18:16.631 --> 02:18:21.490
your,
your reaction times and your techniques and ingraining those paths,
right?

2373
02:18:21.640 --> 02:18:23.440
You're in grading those reaction paths.

2374
02:18:23.441 --> 02:18:26.920
And I don't necessarily think that the way to do that is to go full clip,

2375
02:18:26.921 --> 02:18:29.350
but I think oftentimes when you do that,

2376
02:18:29.351 --> 02:18:34.351
it actually makes you have less options inside the cage because your so like

2377
02:18:34.841 --> 02:18:37.510
wound up and tight and when you're sparring that way,

2378
02:18:37.690 --> 02:18:40.540
you're fighting Robbie Lawler.
Stop sparring for a while.

2379
02:18:40.900 --> 02:18:44.030
He stopped spar for like seven years.
I mean,
yeah,
you develop.

2380
02:18:44.830 --> 02:18:48.820
I have people that come to the gym and again,
when it,
when it comes to stand up,

2381
02:18:48.850 --> 02:18:49.780
only you know,

2382
02:18:49.860 --> 02:18:54.860
I'll put our record and our people against anybody in North America and we don't

2383
02:18:55.031 --> 02:18:58.450
spar heart and I get people to come to the gym all the time coming from a hard

2384
02:18:58.451 --> 02:19:02.320
sparring background and they are missing weapons.

2385
02:19:02.321 --> 02:19:03.820
They are missing tools.

2386
02:19:03.970 --> 02:19:08.970
They are in a fight or flight mode right away you are developing that sniper

2387
02:19:09.641 --> 02:19:14.560
bite down on your mouthpiece I attitude,
which is one attribute of fighting.

2388
02:19:14.560 --> 02:19:18.610
Sometimes you do need to bite down on your mouthpiece but it doesn't work out

2389
02:19:18.611 --> 02:19:21.820
for at least one of the two people doing it in a fight.
Yeah.

2390
02:19:21.821 --> 02:19:26.650
I like what you just said.
It's one attribute of fighting.
Absolutely.
It is one,

2391
02:19:26.651 --> 02:19:28.220
I mean you can't deny that it is one,

2392
02:19:28.600 --> 02:19:33.410
but it is only one and technical proficiency is the most important.

2393
02:19:33.740 --> 02:19:35.510
Being able to,
you know,
throw a jab,

2394
02:19:35.511 --> 02:19:40.070
established Jeb stablish pros use to fake some faints movement and being

2395
02:19:40.071 --> 02:19:43.790
defensively sound and have that incredible variable repertoire.

2396
02:19:45.200 --> 02:19:48.680
And that was one of the things you saw in the fight with Cody versus Tj.

2397
02:19:48.681 --> 02:19:53.210
Tj had a bigger toolbox.
Yeah.
You know,
in terms of his movement.
I mean,

2398
02:19:53.211 --> 02:19:56.240
he was more fluid while he was doing it,
you know,

2399
02:19:56.510 --> 02:20:01.130
and that ultimately proved to be what was most important in that fine,
I'll,

2400
02:20:01.280 --> 02:20:06.280
I'll 100% go to the grave believing that Cody is a far better boxer than Tj.

2401
02:20:07.980 --> 02:20:08.810
Um,

2402
02:20:08.810 --> 02:20:13.810
that didn't translate into an MMA fight on Saturday night for whatever reason.

2403
02:20:14.810 --> 02:20:18.470
Um,
you know,
and whether it's anger or whether it was the last fight,

2404
02:20:18.471 --> 02:20:23.150
whether it was game plan,
lack of coaching,
what,
whatever it was.
Um,

2405
02:20:23.230 --> 02:20:26.270
but 100%,
I believe that,
you know,

2406
02:20:26.271 --> 02:20:30.260
Cody did not show who or what he is that,
have you worked with Cody?

2407
02:20:30.920 --> 02:20:35.010
No.
What'd you want to,
I'm sure I worked with any,

2408
02:20:35.011 --> 02:20:40.011
but I'll work with anybody that has a good attitude and is willing to embrace my

2409
02:20:42.710 --> 02:20:45.830
way of doing because I think he's a very talented guy and I think he could

2410
02:20:45.831 --> 02:20:49.700
really benefit from training with someone like you.
Yeah,
I uh,
again,

2411
02:20:49.730 --> 02:20:52.970
and I think that,
uh,
the relationship that we're developing with Alpha Male,

2412
02:20:52.971 --> 02:20:56.660
they've got a ton of great guys.
There is a good one.
Um,

2413
02:20:56.690 --> 02:21:01.640
but I'm careful not to overstep my bounds.
You know what,
I don't say,

2414
02:21:01.641 --> 02:21:06.260
Hey,
I could fix you.
Come on over here.
Yeah,
I wouldn't,
I wouldn't,

2415
02:21:06.320 --> 02:21:09.140
I wouldn't do that.
The guys there that want to work with me,
I'm,

2416
02:21:09.141 --> 02:21:12.260
I happily work with and they allow my guys to go up there and wrestle,

2417
02:21:12.290 --> 02:21:16.550
which is what we need.
So it's been a good fit,
but I would never poach anybody.

2418
02:21:16.551 --> 02:21:20.150
Good for you,
man.
Good for you.
Yeah,
that's a,
yeah.
You don't want that bad blood.

2419
02:21:20.220 --> 02:21:22.790
Not that bad Juju on you definitely know.

2420
02:21:23.660 --> 02:21:27.030
So what Colin,
going forward with a,

2421
02:21:27.100 --> 02:21:30.920
your camp and with your career,
what are you guys doing now?

2422
02:21:30.921 --> 02:21:32.900
That's different than you have done in the past.

2423
02:21:33.310 --> 02:21:37.400
You have you added anything in terms of strength and conditioning or recovery or

2424
02:21:37.401 --> 02:21:39.770
anything that you find really beneficial?
Um,

2425
02:21:40.340 --> 02:21:43.160
strength and conditioning is always been something that we've done really well

2426
02:21:43.161 --> 02:21:47.940
for,
for us.
Um,
you know,
recently over the last couple of years,
you know,
we,

2427
02:21:47.970 --> 02:21:48.803
we added a,

2428
02:21:48.830 --> 02:21:53.830
Darren I think is really kind of the Darren who you 2 million people listen to

2429
02:21:54.961 --> 02:21:58.220
it,
but the bone crusher that we've added,
we've added the bone crusher.

2430
02:21:58.221 --> 02:22:01.620
He's our head MMA coach.
I'm his striking coach.
Um,

2431
02:22:01.700 --> 02:22:05.410
but what he's brought to the table for us on Instagram to watch oh absolutely

2432
02:22:05.420 --> 02:22:08.780
likes guns.
He does such a,

2433
02:22:09.110 --> 02:22:12.620
such an incredible Iq when it comes to fighting and then it made so much

2434
02:22:12.621 --> 02:22:15.410
knowledge and so many things.
Like sometimes you can agree,

2435
02:22:15.411 --> 02:22:18.350
like sometimes you click with people and like that's what happens between me and

2436
02:22:18.351 --> 02:22:22.340
him.
Like I only like rolling with him really because he,
uh,

2437
02:22:22.341 --> 02:22:25.980
he'll get me in positions that I'm going to probably be in a fire,
but he'll

2438
02:22:25.980 --> 02:22:30.410
<v 3>like walk me through them at the same time versus like,
just like,
oh,</v>

2439
02:22:30.411 --> 02:22:32.340
like it's different deliberate.
Right.

2440
02:22:32.420 --> 02:22:35.250
Learning curve for a striker and they're two different languages.
Right.

2441
02:22:35.251 --> 02:22:36.660
That's why the grapplers have trouble striking.

2442
02:22:36.661 --> 02:22:40.230
The strikers have trouble grappling.
Someone like Darren who can do both,

2443
02:22:40.260 --> 02:22:43.470
that can take a kid like Aston and can walk him through the positions,

2444
02:22:43.471 --> 02:22:44.340
the right choices,

2445
02:22:44.341 --> 02:22:48.840
the wrong choices in the moment while he's doing it is very rare that I have

2446
02:22:48.841 --> 02:22:52.710
found in Darren,
you know,
again,
he half Gracie black belt,

2447
02:22:53.070 --> 02:22:54.210
a few of the world champion,

2448
02:22:54.240 --> 02:22:56.470
but he started out working the front desk at fair techs.

2449
02:22:56.490 --> 02:22:59.430
So he's been around grappling.
Alex Gong is his idol,
you know,

2450
02:22:59.431 --> 02:23:02.640
that's his brother from a,
you know,
I mean,
so,
um,
you know,

2451
02:23:02.641 --> 02:23:05.730
we checked off bucket lists for Darren and he's done two muy Thai fights at a

2452
02:23:05.731 --> 02:23:09.290
pro level now.
Uh,
you know,
just pro Moyie Thai and he's done well.
Yeah,

2453
02:23:09.300 --> 02:23:10.133
I've been following.

2454
02:23:10.610 --> 02:23:13.980
It's interesting to watch and it's one of those things where he wants to shoot

2455
02:23:13.981 --> 02:23:16.230
boxing now and wants to go back to Japan and whatever he wants to do,

2456
02:23:16.231 --> 02:23:17.160
I'm going to support them in.

2457
02:23:17.460 --> 02:23:22.460
But his knowledge of the entire MMA game has helped our gyms so much.

2458
02:23:23.040 --> 02:23:27.780
And our fight team,
I mean,
I think in the UFC our win rate is like 78%.
You know,

2459
02:23:27.781 --> 02:23:32.000
Matt,
Dustin,
Alexis,
all these people came to us off of losing records.
You know,

2460
02:23:32.040 --> 02:23:35.040
Dustin lost two in a row.
He's about to get cut and that lost three in a row.

2461
02:23:35.041 --> 02:23:39.420
Alexis had lost two in a row.
Um,
we have a lot of people text and look fantastic.

2462
02:23:39.421 --> 02:23:44.160
And his last fight,
dusted kid came out of nowhere.
What a crazy angle.

2463
02:23:44.190 --> 02:23:45.150
Yeah,
absolutely.

2464
02:23:45.150 --> 02:23:48.420
Like the handle was up and then it's still just went through and through the

2465
02:23:48.421 --> 02:23:52.750
hand.
So there's also,
the angle was like,
it was like a 45 degree head.

2466
02:23:53.650 --> 02:23:56.850
Dustin's flexibilities in that.
Great.
So that's the kick we work on.

2467
02:23:57.780 --> 02:24:01.110
He can't turn it over the sun highway stretch.
Well he does.
He does,

2468
02:24:01.180 --> 02:24:05.340
but absolutely.
Absolutely.
But from a flexibility standpoint,

2469
02:24:05.380 --> 02:24:09.000
and he's been doing that for so long,
can throw that kick the way he throws it.

2470
02:24:09.001 --> 02:24:11.820
So we embraced it because it's kind of like an off speed pitch.

2471
02:24:12.540 --> 02:24:15.810
That's one that he like slowed it down and then boom.

2472
02:24:15.990 --> 02:24:18.270
That's exactly what mark del Grande's said.

2473
02:24:18.300 --> 02:24:20.260
That's exactly what he said when he described it.

2474
02:24:20.620 --> 02:24:24.130
We talked about it the other day.
Yeah.
So and again,
that's why,
you know,

2475
02:24:24.180 --> 02:24:26.190
we talk about people switching,
like you know,
when,

2476
02:24:26.191 --> 02:24:30.660
when we talk about Mateus his opponent,
I remember his last name.
Um,
you know,

2477
02:24:30.690 --> 02:24:34.170
we knew what a great boxer he was,
but whenever he went south paw,

2478
02:24:34.350 --> 02:24:38.470
he didn't do anything.
Southby didn't Dustin do some work with that?
Sand Dunes?

2479
02:24:38.471 --> 02:24:40.920
Stepper does all the time.
All the time.
It does all this all the time.

2480
02:24:40.980 --> 02:24:43.590
I've got that thing here now.
Yeah.
Know Dustin swears by it.

2481
02:24:43.591 --> 02:24:45.270
He loves that thing every day.

2482
02:24:45.300 --> 02:24:48.180
That is a crazy what for people that don't know him,
don't know what it is.

2483
02:24:48.181 --> 02:24:49.880
They sent me one on the sand dunes stepper.

2484
02:24:49.890 --> 02:24:54.890
It's like these two really smushy pads that are together and it's great for,

2485
02:24:55.060 --> 02:24:57.500
it's almost like standing on a stability ball.
Right.

2486
02:24:57.550 --> 02:25:00.450
You stand on them and they're all mushy and you got to kind of use all your

2487
02:25:00.451 --> 02:25:05.430
stabilized.
No,
I've never used it.
Dustin runs,
Dustin runs on it.

2488
02:25:05.790 --> 02:25:10.260
Yeah.
I mean literally just sprints on it just does left.
Right.
Left,
right,
left,

2489
02:25:10.261 --> 02:25:14.040
right all day long.
He does upper body too.
And correct me if I'm wrong,

2490
02:25:14.041 --> 02:25:18.180
he had like some ankle issues and that,
that corrected it for him.
Yes.
Yes,
yes.

2491
02:25:18.240 --> 02:25:21.390
Yeah.
So no,
he's,
he's somebody who um,
you know,

2492
02:25:21.420 --> 02:25:24.130
literally like we talked about my gym.
Dustin showed up

2493
02:25:24.130 --> 02:25:27.160
<v 0>one day,
didn't even call me.
Uh,
it was before the Makowski fight.</v>

2494
02:25:27.161 --> 02:25:29.680
He showed up at my gym one day and started taking classes.

2495
02:25:29.710 --> 02:25:31.330
I don't even know who he was.
Wow.

2496
02:25:31.710 --> 02:25:35.800
I had no idea what he had come in like two years before that when he was with

2497
02:25:35.801 --> 02:25:38.830
Duke,
when he was,
when he was a dude,
he came in and visited,
like did a class.

2498
02:25:38.831 --> 02:25:41.540
Then he came back in and did a class and I was like,
are,
he's still with UFC?

2499
02:25:41.590 --> 02:25:44.020
He's like,
yeah,
I got a fight coming up.
He said,
will you train me?
And I said,

2500
02:25:44.021 --> 02:25:46.960
sure.
I said,
that's fine.
Uh,
so we train them for it.

2501
02:25:47.020 --> 02:25:50.800
I was actually in Italy with Kevin for bellatore guest onto one.

2502
02:25:50.801 --> 02:25:54.780
Cornered him when he fought my cops.
I saw you out there in Toronto.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2503
02:25:54.800 --> 02:25:57.730
That first fight.
And literally that first camp,

2504
02:25:58.000 --> 02:26:01.690
he and I didn't do a single pad session.
He,
all he did was classes.

2505
02:26:02.470 --> 02:26:06.550
That was it.
That's how humble he is.
He didn't come in.
I'm a UFC guy.

2506
02:26:06.551 --> 02:26:09.640
I'm this and that and that's what I'm looking for him.
And I worked a little bit,

2507
02:26:09.641 --> 02:26:11.810
we did a little,
I was going to corner her hand.
Uh,

2508
02:26:12.140 --> 02:26:14.820
Carrie and obviously knew he was going to be cornering Kevin.
Uh,

2509
02:26:15.130 --> 02:26:17.830
so I went up there with him,
so I started working a little bit together.

2510
02:26:17.831 --> 02:26:21.700
But it's such a great guy,
man.
Good vibes from Dustin Ortiz.
Yeah,

2511
02:26:21.701 --> 02:26:25.780
it seems like a really great guy.
And he's got like six goddamn lungs,

2512
02:26:25.810 --> 02:26:29.040
like heels just never get tired.
He's one of those guys,

2513
02:26:29.041 --> 02:26:30.700
I won 25 or I'm a feather way.

2514
02:26:30.701 --> 02:26:35.701
But you can spar like 20 rounds with a guy and he will not stop coming at you.

2515
02:26:36.100 --> 02:26:38.140
Yeah.
Well with this,
when this past weekend when,

2516
02:26:38.141 --> 02:26:42.070
so who doe beat Dj that way class just opened wide up.
Yeah.
That's,

2517
02:26:42.210 --> 02:26:43.990
that's what happens when something like that happens.

2518
02:26:43.991 --> 02:26:46.780
It happened with Chris Weidman beat Anderson Silva when the,

2519
02:26:46.781 --> 02:26:50.560
the undefeatable champion gets beat and then all of a sudden contenders will

2520
02:26:50.561 --> 02:26:51.394
rise.

2521
02:26:51.520 --> 02:26:55.330
And so there's a an interesting time for everybody at one 25 it's just such a

2522
02:26:55.331 --> 02:26:59.620
hard week class to find elite fighters.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And you know,
I've,

2523
02:26:59.621 --> 02:27:01.630
I've talked to Bella tour about it cause I've had other people out,

2524
02:27:01.910 --> 02:27:05.830
they have no interest in it.
None,
no one interest in 25 there.

2525
02:27:06.100 --> 02:27:10.840
They're debating how long they want to keep 35 really getting really

2526
02:27:11.050 --> 02:27:15.850
interesting.
But they don't do women,
uh,
in kickboxing under one 25,

2527
02:27:16.120 --> 02:27:16.391
you know,

2528
02:27:16.391 --> 02:27:20.380
they won't go near it and they don't do women over one 45 and they don't want

2529
02:27:20.381 --> 02:27:21.910
any men.
They don't have any men.

2530
02:27:21.911 --> 02:27:26.170
You've never seen a man kickbox for Bella tour less than 145 pounds.
Yeah,

2531
02:27:26.380 --> 02:27:29.440
it's never happened.
Is that because they're worried about power?

2532
02:27:30.490 --> 02:27:33.580
I think they're just worried about marketability.
Yeah.

2533
02:27:33.610 --> 02:27:36.460
But that's the thing is like the bigger people hit harder,

2534
02:27:36.790 --> 02:27:41.170
kinda more exciting to watch.
Absolutely.
Well,
listen gentlemen,

2535
02:27:41.830 --> 02:27:45.460
this has been fun.
It's always fun.
It's fun.
This time I didn't talk last time.

2536
02:27:45.461 --> 02:27:48.640
I got a lot of shit for not talking.
Last time you talked a little,
a little,

2537
02:27:49.090 --> 02:27:52.290
a little bit.
People who give you shit.
Just everybody.
Oh,

2538
02:27:52.300 --> 02:27:55.810
I want you to tell him like,
tell him to shut the fuck up.
It wasn't,

2539
02:27:55.870 --> 02:27:59.040
it wasn't about me.
It was about Kevin and guest.
Thank you for having won.

2540
02:27:59.120 --> 02:28:02.950
Oh my pleasure.
Anytime.
Listen,
I think what you're doing is really awesome.

2541
02:28:02.980 --> 02:28:05.530
I love the fact that you're competing in three different sports,

2542
02:28:05.531 --> 02:28:08.030
and the fact that you're doing it at the highest level,
it's,

2543
02:28:08.050 --> 02:28:11.710
it's really inspiring and it's interesting and it's very compelling,
you know,

2544
02:28:11.711 --> 02:28:16.570
and you're doing it at an awesome way.
Like I keep,

2545
02:28:16.700 --> 02:28:21.630
I plan on,
keep doing it and I went as far as long as I can.
So I just go.
So May.

2546
02:28:21.680 --> 02:28:22.513
But

2547
02:28:22.640 --> 02:28:25.100
<v 4>yeah,
man,
I'm,
I'm having fun.
I love fighting.
I've been doing this.</v>

2548
02:28:25.101 --> 02:28:29.000
I was 12 years old,
so I like to stay busy.
So anything that I can do,

2549
02:28:29.001 --> 02:28:31.610
if I can do more tie,
if I can do kick boxing,
if I can do them in May,
I'll,

2550
02:28:31.670 --> 02:28:34.310
I'll do it all at night.
And a CSA,

2551
02:28:34.311 --> 02:28:38.950
Jim on Instagram is just CSA.
Jim Correct.
At CSA,

underscore Bolanos and spell belongs for the o l a man.

2554
02:28:45.500 --> 02:28:48.730
That was beautiful.
Yeah.
Thank you gentlemen.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I'm fine.

2555
02:28:48.970 --> 02:28:49.803
Thank you

2556
02:28:56.000 --> 02:28:56.833
<v 5>man.</v>

2557
02:29:04.430 --> 02:29:04.510
Okay.
