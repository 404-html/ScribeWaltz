1
00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.540
Last chance for romance here.

2
00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:04.900
Otherwise we're just going to film and then put it up.

3
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:08.873
Is it alive?

4
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.880
<v 2>Really?
I sent her.
I sent her to make it happen.</v>

5
00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.650
We've been having problems with our tri caster.
It doesn't want to try.
It's like,

6
00:00:16.651 --> 00:00:20.420
no today.
Every third show it don't,

7
00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:24.150
just wired won't go live.
I centered the Cheeto I've,
I sent the energy dude.

8
00:00:24.151 --> 00:00:27.150
You made it happen.
They did rare wake and bake day.

9
00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.990
I know you don't know.
No,
I get shit done first.
Usually.

10
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.970
Can you not get shit done when you wake and bake?

11
00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.760
I kind of fuck off things if I get,

12
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.190
if I get high at nine o'clock in the morning like Ah,
what's,

13
00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:45.270
what's important really?
I get stuff done.
Yeah.
I have like,

14
00:00:45.271 --> 00:00:48.290
you know,
I'll do like my cup of coffee and a joint and I'll get some stuff done.

15
00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:51.600
I joke that it's like,
it makes me super motivated to do not a goddamn thing,

16
00:00:51.601 --> 00:00:53.680
but I get stuff done.
I mean

17
00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:54.470
<v 1>all of this</v>

18
00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.440
<v 2>stuff I get done as,
I like vacuum seven times.</v>

19
00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.280
I cleaned my apartment like four times the other day.

20
00:01:00.281 --> 00:01:02.650
It's a math thing you share.
Someone's not slipping back into,

21
00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.880
that's not put all the rumors out there now,
but you got any bread?

22
00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:06.880
He Bravo used to say that,

23
00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.270
<v 0>but girls like he would if he was dating of glitzy.</v>

24
00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.760
Eddie used to work at a strip club and he dated a lot of the gals that a were

25
00:01:12.761 --> 00:01:15.880
performers there and he said,
do you really know when a girl is a meth head?

26
00:01:15.881 --> 00:01:17.440
Cause you go over a house,
it's always clean.

27
00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.840
<v 2>She's always cleaning that they can never clean enough.</v>

28
00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.910
Maybe I'm a method or just a Virgo.
Apparently.
Speed freaks.
Not method.
Sorry.

29
00:01:24.911 --> 00:01:26.830
Speed freaks when people were on speed.

30
00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:28.630
Maybe coffee is the thing that does that to me.

31
00:01:28.631 --> 00:01:30.280
And then I just get focused from the weed.

32
00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.600
There's not one ounce of dog hair in my house.
Really fresh.
That's crazy.

33
00:01:34.601 --> 00:01:39.040
You have like $50 you're a crazy dog lady.
I do.

34
00:01:39.041 --> 00:01:42.640
I have three dogs.
Wait,
don't you have like a pack of chicken in your backyard?

35
00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:43.750
Dude,
I used to.

36
00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.080
<v 0>What happened to them?
Coyotes got them all.</v>

37
00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.470
I thought you were up with a bow and arrow.
We had an issue.

38
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.750
Where are a chicken coop burnt to the ground?

39
00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.450
<v 2>Oh fuck.
Fuck.
During those fires,
you lost your ladies.</v>

40
00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.630
<v 0>No,
we didn't.
They,
they managed to fly out and they were in the yard.</v>

41
00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.910
We lost two of them because they wouldn't,

42
00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.120
we couldn't round them up to get them into the chicken pen.

43
00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:06.950
Cause we've got a new chicken pen.
What?

44
00:02:06.951 --> 00:02:10.940
It wasn't as big and then they were too good for it.
I odis eight,
those two.

45
00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.180
And then they realize that they're all on this one pen and one day when we're

46
00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:17.290
gone,
they opened it up and got him killed.

47
00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.670
<v 2>All nine of them.
How they owe,
have they opened them up,</v>

48
00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.430
pulled it apart with her teeth.
You know,
dogs are,
listen,

49
00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.720
he's a domestic one's domestic dogs,
but they're smart.
The difference changes.

50
00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.810
<v 0>Coyote and a domestic dog is like the difference between a hardened criminal on</v>

51
00:02:33.261 --> 00:02:35.180
death row and a baby.

52
00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.190
<v 2>No,
you're hundred percent right.</v>

53
00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.160
It's the experience and what you had to do to survive.

54
00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:40.630
It's all they've done to survive.

55
00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.840
They don't have a house that was feeding them food.

56
00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.250
I mean they're fucking little wool and it's like literally doggy dog world out

57
00:02:48.251 --> 00:02:49.420
there.
Yeah.
What was the

58
00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.950
<v 0>gentlemen,
Dan?
Um,
Coyote America.</v>

59
00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.040
The the author,
goddammit.

60
00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.830
<v 2>Was he like a doodle lived amongst the world's?
Yes.
Dan?
No,</v>

61
00:02:59.831 --> 00:03:04.450
he's a wildlife biologist and a historian and he was talking about the history

62
00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.810
of coyotes and wolves in North America.

63
00:03:07.811 --> 00:03:11.620
Apparently all wild dog species came from North America.

64
00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.170
Even like jackals and shit like that.

65
00:03:14.171 --> 00:03:17.290
Like they made it across over there somehow.

66
00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.580
Like during the Pangea period or some Shit Pangea.

67
00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:24.700
Do you know what that is?
It's the era.
No,
it's,

68
00:03:24.701 --> 00:03:28.720
well when they think that all of the continents were connected together.

69
00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.580
We are one,
we are one flat earthen flat table.

70
00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.280
It was flat.
No,
no,
no.

71
00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.010
Just obviously not a giant chunk and then the rest was water and then it spread

72
00:03:39.011 --> 00:03:41.440
out,
which is fucking weird.
But what is happening?

73
00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.160
How did that and like also is that happening on our insights on like it's

74
00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.370
obviously on a cellular level of the things just splitting and being torn the

75
00:03:48.371 --> 00:03:52.960
fuck apart.
Here it is.
Here's the,
the modern pangea map.
This is modern.

76
00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:58.180
It's a modern country separations and all that because,
oh,

77
00:03:58.181 --> 00:04:01.700
this is what it looked like.
I thought this is,
there's more.

78
00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:05.140
It's still real America.
What is that?

79
00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.800
I thought there was some knuckleheads and thought that is that really all of the

80
00:04:08.801 --> 00:04:12.470
continents together?
Whoa.
Who is it shows you how much God damn water there is.

81
00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:17.740
That's a mind fuck because you really like to think that we're all dirt and not

82
00:04:17.741 --> 00:04:20.470
as much water.
It's so much water.
It's all water.

83
00:04:20.471 --> 00:04:24.250
It's like a little speck in a huge ass ocean.
This was really crazy.

84
00:04:24.251 --> 00:04:25.720
So it was ground dwelling.

85
00:04:25.721 --> 00:04:29.170
Motherfuckers if figured out how sock all the fish out of that water

86
00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.700
just to be able to get those suckers out your bare hands and then they were
like,

87
00:04:36.701 --> 00:04:39.040
Yo,
we need something.
We need the smaller situation.

88
00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.070
I think until they came up with the nets and stuff like that,

89
00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.420
I don't think they were real effective.

90
00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:45.490
I think they just got what they got and they ate that,

91
00:04:45.491 --> 00:04:46.870
but the populations were fine,

92
00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:50.800
but in the last whatever hundred and 50 years they've been using nets,

93
00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:52.780
they just jacked that whole ocean.

94
00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:55.090
What do you think happened to the dude who figured out like the hook?

95
00:04:55.091 --> 00:04:58.260
He probably got all the pussy in town that do to like hook the fish.

96
00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:59.770
He was getting all those fisheries.

97
00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:02.110
He was getting the ones that were way deep to what?

98
00:05:02.111 --> 00:05:06.670
The kind of pussy that you would get back when you invented a book.

99
00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:11.470
You don't want it
in your mind and mind you don't,

100
00:05:11.471 --> 00:05:16.240
but back then you're like,
Yo,
this is fresh,
fresh.
It only smells like must.

101
00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:21.830
How'd you become African American?
Something's happening to you,

102
00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:30.160
taking you to another level.
Another level for sure.
Yeah.

103
00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.510
Let's guess how long ago do you think they invented the fish hawk?

104
00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:35.973
Did they even know?

105
00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:41.550
I'm going to say it's a really old invention world arrowhead time close to like

106
00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:47.950
native native.
Those bitches would just break.

107
00:05:47.951 --> 00:05:51.130
If you think about a big fish hooking like a little thin,

108
00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:54.660
what would they make it a bone?
Probably must be hard,

109
00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:59.660
but you would think don't want to be too heavy.
Show just sinking break.
Yeah.

110
00:05:59.661 --> 00:06:03.630
I wouldn't be able to cook it.
Well yeah,
it must've been bone.
Yeah,

111
00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:06.530
but bones get brittle,
especially after like,

112
00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:11.360
you know they're off the body and they start to calcify and all that.

113
00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:16.840
But how old do you think it is?
It's got to be really old.
Juniper,
what it says,

114
00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:20.810
juniper wood was the first one 23,000 years ago.

115
00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:24.890
Norwegians?
Yeah.
Those

116
00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:30.510
are made from sea snail shells.
Well that's crazy.

117
00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:34.220
A bunch of information I'll put together and this in Okinawa island data between

118
00:06:34.221 --> 00:06:39.221
20 2003 80 and 20 2007 70 in that crazy that they get it that close.

119
00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:43.610
They're basically in an inner give or take 80 90 years.

120
00:06:43.611 --> 00:06:47.480
A hundred years there in that new room.
Like the,
is it carbon dating?

121
00:06:47.481 --> 00:06:50.750
I mean that's the only thing I remember from high school.
How do you even,

122
00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:52.390
how do you date it back?
Do they find,

123
00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:55.220
is it like a forensic thing where they grab a fly and they're like,
yeah,

124
00:06:55.221 --> 00:06:59.440
this was six years ago because of the juices on the wings.
I think it's,

125
00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:01.360
there's like a bunch of factors.

126
00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:04.430
One of them is the dirt that's around where they find it.

127
00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:08.540
Like if they find it on the ground and it's covered with dirt over hundreds and

128
00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:13.290
hundreds of years,
it could take some of that dirt and
they they're,

129
00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:17.930
they're trying to test I think.
Whoa.
That's crazy.
Earrings.

130
00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:22.040
Is that official?
Yeah,
I clicked the the shelves.
Those are fresh.

131
00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:26.730
Those are really nice.
I would rock those.
What'd you comedy store?

132
00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:31.760
Oldest fish hook found in Okinawa at,
wow.
23,000 years ago.
That's crazy.

133
00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:35.060
So they're saying that the oldest fishhook is linked to the Norwegians?

134
00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:37.250
I would say Japanese.
This is Okinawa.

135
00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:40.940
Norwegian thing was saying that and up until the 1950s there were,

136
00:07:40.941 --> 00:07:45.200
they were still using wood and
added fact want an ease.

137
00:07:45.201 --> 00:07:48.080
Makes Sense.
If they all figured it out the same time,

138
00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:52.460
different spots in the world.
It's one of those things like you don't like the,

139
00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:54.470
there's just some weird thing who's that?

140
00:07:54.471 --> 00:07:57.260
Is that Rupert Sheldrake is the morphic residence theory.

141
00:07:57.290 --> 00:08:01.850
He's got this weird theory that I think the idea is that if some a rat learns

142
00:08:01.851 --> 00:08:06.350
amaze on the east coast rats on the west coast,
we'll learn that maze quicker.

143
00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:10.570
What,
how like uh,
like uh,
they don't know.

144
00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:14.570
They don't know consciousness amongst the rats.
As weird as it sounds,

145
00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:19.130
there might be some sort of strange connection that all rats share and not just

146
00:08:19.131 --> 00:08:21.170
all rats but all living beings.

147
00:08:21.171 --> 00:08:26.171
His argument was that if this is demonstrate a bubble with a rat in a maze,

148
00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:29.450
that if they did something like a with human beings,

149
00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:32.760
if they could figure out a way to uh,
to prove this,

150
00:08:32.761 --> 00:08:34.830
that's likely what's happening.
Is it like he was,

151
00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:38.870
he brought up a bunch of different factors like inventions that are

152
00:08:38.871 --> 00:08:42.050
simultaneously taking place like all over the world.

153
00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:46.210
Like you shouldn't attribute some of that to education,
right?
Like yeah,

154
00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:47.940
definitely education.
What's going on like that,

155
00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:50.540
the trends that are happening in education,

156
00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:53.870
but they also think there might be something else going on underneath the

157
00:08:53.871 --> 00:08:56.070
surface on a different realm.
Like

158
00:08:56.070 --> 00:09:00.300
<v 0>if you learn,
if we're all a species and you're on one side of the world,</v>

159
00:09:00.301 --> 00:09:01.021
you learn something.

160
00:09:01.021 --> 00:09:04.290
The people on the other side of the world have like greater access to it in some

161
00:09:04.291 --> 00:09:04.950
weird way.

162
00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:08.760
<v 3>That's really bizarre.
Yeah,
I don't,
that freaks me out.
That's like Matrix.</v>

163
00:09:08.761 --> 00:09:09.594
He's shit right there.

164
00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:12.370
<v 0>It's also unprovable and you bring it up to a real scientists.</v>

165
00:09:12.371 --> 00:09:16.420
They get upset with you.
But what's interesting though is the map,
the map thing,

166
00:09:16.421 --> 00:09:20.380
the maze thing with mice and rats.
The cause,
I think that's safe.

167
00:09:20.381 --> 00:09:21.280
That's been improving.
Uh,

168
00:09:21.281 --> 00:09:26.281
pretty sure it has the thing that if you show a main or rat on one side of the

169
00:09:26.831 --> 00:09:29.170
country,
they learn it quicker on the other side,
how the,

170
00:09:29.171 --> 00:09:31.690
I don't understand how that can even be a thing.

171
00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:34.420
But there's another one that's really interesting,

172
00:09:34.421 --> 00:09:37.450
but I don't know how much of this is just cause they didn't observe it before,

173
00:09:37.451 --> 00:09:41.530
but they've noticed that apes are starting to use tools

174
00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:44.590
<v 3>like cell phones to text each other.
No,
not tat yet.</v>

175
00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:48.760
Wa weren't monkeys using tools so islands together?
Oh

176
00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:51.500
No.

177
00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:53.780
<v 0>Apparently they use tools like to get um,</v>

178
00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:57.950
like they'll stick sticks into a ant hills to get pants,

179
00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:02.270
but they're also use rocks to break things open or money doing that before I

180
00:10:02.271 --> 00:10:03.860
would imagine Abe's would follow suit.

181
00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:08.180
I think they've done what they're saying is they're saying officially that

182
00:10:08.181 --> 00:10:11.930
they've entered into the stone age.
Oh boy.
So like if we are watching,

183
00:10:11.931 --> 00:10:16.931
if you saw a human evolve from being a person that you know what we,

184
00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:20.010
whatever the fuck we used to look like when they first figured out fish hooks

185
00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:24.920
granting to today,
you know,
there's many,
many generations of change and all,

186
00:10:24.921 --> 00:10:27.740
all sorts of different shit that we learned that we are watching.

187
00:10:27.741 --> 00:10:32.720
Literally the birth of that separation between like the regular chimps that are

188
00:10:32.721 --> 00:10:36.050
just chilling in the forest to the chimps that are starting to figure out tools

189
00:10:36.051 --> 00:10:37.070
and weapons.
Right?

190
00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:41.690
It's the first day we see a chimp make a fucking spear like a spear,

191
00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:44.900
sharpen it up and stab another chimp to death.

192
00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:49.560
<v 3>Planet of the apes chimps are becoming woke.
Is that what's happening?</v>

193
00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:52.980
I think there's becoming an enlightened and smarter.
I know,
think just chimps.

194
00:10:52.981 --> 00:10:55.050
There was one with an orangutan.
It was amazing.

195
00:10:55.051 --> 00:10:59.230
I'm marijuana town spear spearfishing.
Oh No,
dude,
you got to see it.
That's crazy.

196
00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:01.990
I mean it's really crazy,
but like it's a beautiful photo.

197
00:11:01.991 --> 00:11:05.190
It's going to be walking down the highway with like a briefcase soon.

198
00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:08.550
I don't think it's going to be,
they're freaky man.
That freaks me out.

199
00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:11.420
But it is a,
so we're witnessing evolution,

200
00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:15.150
<v 0>they're learning things.
And this one,
I think the issue was that this,
uh,</v>

201
00:11:15.151 --> 00:11:19.620
orangutan had watched fishermen do this so he had apparently watched some

202
00:11:19.621 --> 00:11:23.160
fishermen like Stan on a ledge and stab fish.

203
00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:25.500
So he decided to try to figure it out himself.

204
00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:29.370
<v 3>That makes sense.
I mean that's how all creatures essentially,
I mean puppies,</v>

205
00:11:29.371 --> 00:11:31.770
kittens,
they all learn is just to be,
it's to a limit.

206
00:11:31.771 --> 00:11:35.010
They don't get past that sort of being able to use tools together.

207
00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:37.980
That picture that's a wild is bringing up video too.

208
00:11:37.981 --> 00:11:40.110
So I thought there might have been had video of it,
but um,

209
00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:45.000
my dog opened his mouth.
It is dog food container when I was gone.
Damn.

210
00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:49.950
A twist.
A twist.
Yes.
I don't know how he did it.
I got to get a camera,

211
00:11:49.951 --> 00:11:53.740
but I came home and that top was twisted off in his was like,

212
00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:59.440
looks at you.
That picture
rang Tang spear phishing.

213
00:11:59.441 --> 00:12:03.280
I mean that is crazy that you saw that in a movie.
You would say that is fake.

214
00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:07.810
That is so that looks like a still from jungle book.
It's amazing.

215
00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:11.730
It's an amazing photo.
That photo framed.
Jamie,

216
00:12:11.770 --> 00:12:16.060
get a copy of that photo and let's do that.
That's a really cool room.

217
00:12:16.061 --> 00:12:20.200
That fucker framed.
I talk about this picture all the time.

218
00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:24.580
That is so wild.
So fascinating.
It really looks like the jungle book,

219
00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:29.600
you know.
Um,
have you ever had your 23 and me done?
I,

220
00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:32.650
you don't want them to learn about it,
but like how accurate is it?

221
00:12:32.651 --> 00:12:35.410
You know what's with this science,

222
00:12:35.770 --> 00:12:38.260
you're just going to trust a piece of paper that comes back.

223
00:12:38.261 --> 00:12:40.870
I want him to go to the lab and see who's doing this.
Like,

224
00:12:40.871 --> 00:12:43.990
how do you know you're not just getting some like,
you know,

225
00:12:44.050 --> 00:12:47.470
general packet that they're sending back to you.
How do you know,

226
00:12:47.471 --> 00:12:49.390
why would they do that?
Because they're got your money.

227
00:12:49.391 --> 00:12:50.800
Why would anyone do anything?

228
00:12:51.010 --> 00:12:54.490
Why are mother fuckers fro in fits in grocery stores?
People are crazy.

229
00:12:54.530 --> 00:12:58.280
<v 0>So,
you know when we're talking about if you get high,
you get a little bit,</v>

230
00:12:58.730 --> 00:13:02.030
just a little bit psychotic.
Like there's something,

231
00:13:02.390 --> 00:13:06.440
something happens and you really do like enter into the world.
Schizophrenia.

232
00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:07.373
Yeah.

233
00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:11.940
<v 3>Did it,
how do I know this science is good.
Done it.</v>

234
00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:14.550
Oh yeah,
yeah,
I did it.
And what did it say?

235
00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:19.740
<v 0>All kinds of stuff.
Mostly stuff.
I knew that I'm mostly Italian and Irish,</v>

236
00:13:19.741 --> 00:13:22.530
but they,
they put Irish and English together,
which I thought was interesting.

237
00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:25.840
I've 1.6% African,
um,

238
00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:30.980
57% more neanderthal traits than the average person I could have told you that I

239
00:13:31.061 --> 00:13:33.050
could have told without even the blood work.
I saw the,

240
00:13:33.070 --> 00:13:34.720
I saw the paperwork and I'm like,
ah man,

241
00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:37.140
I figures and then there's something wrong.

242
00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:40.450
<v 3>Look at that.
Look at that face.
Look at the head.
You're definitely Andra Athol.</v>

243
00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:42.790
You're like,
you're a link that's missing for sure.

244
00:13:42.890 --> 00:13:47.210
<v 0>No,
it's just a Italians in general.
And the don't be angry.</v>

245
00:13:47.270 --> 00:13:48.410
My Italian people,

246
00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:53.460
<v 3>because I'm,
I'm Sicilian was strange monkey folk.
Right?</v>

247
00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:55.610
That should be your next special title.

248
00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:59.050
<v 0>So when I was in Italy,</v>

249
00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:04.780
we had a cab drivers and the cab drivers would like to stick their head out the

250
00:14:04.781 --> 00:14:07.660
window.
Stare at someone's ass,
we'll get to is a motto.

251
00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:12.740
<v 3>The slow down and speed up
their smooth,</v>

252
00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:16.310
<v 0>but it's just,
it's just their savage.
They're like,
and then I thought about it,</v>

253
00:14:16.311 --> 00:14:19.710
I was like,
well of course they are.
Like they used to be the Romans.
Yeah.

254
00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:21.570
And they used to be the anchor to everyone up.

255
00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:26.340
I mean you're managing how gross life must've been like back then with people

256
00:14:26.610 --> 00:14:29.430
<v 3>gross.
It's gross now,
but it was really gross then without plumbing.</v>

257
00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:32.820
And I will say your toilet seats are the warmest I've ever sat on.

258
00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:37.320
Thank you very much.
So it compared from here to the Roman era?
Yeah.
Nasty.
Yeah.

259
00:14:37.321 --> 00:14:41.550
What did they do?
They,
they oil their oil.
Other shit though.

260
00:14:41.551 --> 00:14:43.920
Went through the streets right of the problem.

261
00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:48.030
That's why everybody was infected and sick.
And I mean there's no system.

262
00:14:48.031 --> 00:14:51.980
They couldn't probably about Mulch,
you know,
maybe like fertilizer

263
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:54.430
<v 2>to pour over it.
But that was it.
You know what?
I bet it was like,</v>

264
00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:56.390
it's like people throw their cigarette butts on the ground,

265
00:14:56.391 --> 00:15:00.420
like someone will clean it.
Someone else,
a clean it,
some little,
uh,

266
00:15:00.950 --> 00:15:04.070
you know,
some little hand will grab it,
some little poor kid.

267
00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:09.920
But I mean there's no perspective.
They were just in their own little,
yeah,

268
00:15:09.921 --> 00:15:10.460
they didn't know.

269
00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:14.540
They didn't know they were living as sophisticated as anybody that ever did this

270
00:15:14.541 --> 00:15:16.220
shit holes.
Is that where you shadow?

271
00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:19.040
That's the shadow and you're around a bunch of other people.
Shadow

272
00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:24.470
that looks like you putting your toes and you get Manny a pedicure.

273
00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:27.030
That's what that little thing spread your toes apart.

274
00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:31.580
Do you think that those folks had like curtains in between them when they shot?

275
00:15:32.190 --> 00:15:35.600
Look at that.
Look at that corner seat.
Upper yeah,
right there.

276
00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:40.700
How about that one is touching everybody's touching shit.
Yeah,
they were all,

277
00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:42.710
they were all just in it.
Having a conversation.

278
00:15:42.711 --> 00:15:46.850
Talking about the latest gladiator sports.
Can you believe the tiger got,
um,

279
00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:50.930
I don't know why it sounds like that
when we were there,

280
00:15:50.931 --> 00:15:52.310
they were talking about the front rows.

281
00:15:52.311 --> 00:15:55.970
The front rows were all the rich people sat to watch the calcium and that was

282
00:15:55.971 --> 00:15:57.680
when if a tiger did get out,

283
00:15:57.980 --> 00:16:00.740
that's where they usually got to those people and killed a bunch of them.

284
00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:02.300
That's ironic.
Ironic.

285
00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:05.780
Just there to get a front row seat and then nature is like gut gow.
Gotcha.

286
00:16:06.050 --> 00:16:08.840
Get sparked.
Look at these cars.
They're all jerking each other off.

287
00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:12.980
She maybe sandals.
Oh course these everything in sandals.

288
00:16:12.981 --> 00:16:17.930
Who's the guy with a Satchel?
All the way on the left.
Okay.
Covering his cock.

289
00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:23.270
Oh,
okay.
I get it.
Oh I bet that's not true.

290
00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:27.410
But dogs didn't shit in the whole year at oh this shit on the floor.
Shit.

291
00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:31.860
On the everything.
So it was,
there were like,
what are these spoons for it?

292
00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:36.230
There's other shifts with spoons too,
in case it gets cold.

293
00:16:36.231 --> 00:16:40.410
Probably Scoop the water out.
Disgusting facts.
I'm gonna pull it up.
Oh boy.

294
00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:43.670
Oh boy.
Who's this guy?

295
00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.270
Some guy would have video and discussing things with poop.
Yeah.

296
00:16:47.271 --> 00:16:50.210
You guys have the nicest toilet here ever.
I can't imagine.
I mean,

297
00:16:50.211 --> 00:16:51.790
what was sex like back then?

298
00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:56.660
Even though they're in their own era and their perspective is limited because of

299
00:16:57.080 --> 00:17:00.500
just where they're at.
It still must've been gross.
Disgusting.

300
00:17:00.650 --> 00:17:04.930
They must have smelled terrible.
There's no soap.
There's no soap.
No.

301
00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:08.660
Well they must have had so it was like,
you know,

302
00:17:08.661 --> 00:17:12.350
it just wasn't as fancy as our soaps.
Just no deodorant.

303
00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:16.400
No deodorant was just oils and water.
What is going on here,
Jamie?

304
00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:20.030
Or they're sharing that spoon thing.

305
00:17:20.031 --> 00:17:24.570
I can't tell what the fuck is the school in a real moment wipe with or if the

306
00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:28.880
pour water on it and Cosby.
Here's the other thing too.

307
00:17:28.881 --> 00:17:32.780
Why not be a little further apart boys?
Yeah.
Why are they so close?

308
00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:37.140
Hey fellow with the robe.
How about you scoot over.
There's a couple extra stall.

309
00:17:37.141 --> 00:17:38.600
Share that spoon.
You don't want to be reaching

310
00:17:40.970 --> 00:17:45.350
for that spoon on your butt to Bree was loose.
He was down a couple of seats,

311
00:17:45.351 --> 00:17:47.060
but home needed a hand to hold.

312
00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:50.580
I think what that was is they would take that spoon and they would wash their

313
00:17:50.581 --> 00:17:52.350
hands and use their hand to wash their,

314
00:17:52.351 --> 00:17:55.890
but that's so barbaric.

315
00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:59.190
That's why I think you're not supposed to shake hands with your left hand in

316
00:17:59.191 --> 00:18:03.490
some cultures.
I think take us there yet.
Yeah.
So you would uh,

317
00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:06.270
take the water,
he'd pour it in your hand.
If I had to guess.

318
00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:10.350
And you lather your butthole.
I mean why not grab a leaf?

319
00:18:10.351 --> 00:18:13.310
Those fuckers are wearing leafs anyways.
His outfit and leaves

320
00:18:15.450 --> 00:18:17.040
and the leaf outfit.

321
00:18:17.310 --> 00:18:21.540
I think the leafs is something the added to those Roman statues.

322
00:18:21.541 --> 00:18:24.900
When people got mad about the penis,
they got a little weird.

323
00:18:24.990 --> 00:18:28.980
They got a little modest modest then without any plumbing.

324
00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:33.250
Well I think they um,
they just decided that Dick's or bad.

325
00:18:34.670 --> 00:18:35.980
I decided that a long time.

326
00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:41.130
So they had a sponge on the end of a stick.
They would wipe them.

327
00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:43.830
They shared a sponge.

328
00:18:48.910 --> 00:18:50.740
Oh Man.
Duncan,

329
00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:57.980
but sponge since we got these toilets that actually clean your butt with warm

330
00:18:58.171 --> 00:19:02.400
water,
when you press a button,
nicest boats.
Also the cleanest,

331
00:19:02.401 --> 00:19:04.740
like what are we doing?
Smear and shit around.

332
00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:09.870
All you're doing is like smear and some of it off everywhere on the handles.

333
00:19:09.871 --> 00:19:11.160
If shit came out of your nose,

334
00:19:11.161 --> 00:19:14.430
would you be comfortable just smear in it like that and just give it a good wipe

335
00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:16.830
in Rome?
Are we in right now?

336
00:19:19.410 --> 00:19:22.770
No.
I'm a very clean person.
I wet nap,

337
00:19:22.771 --> 00:19:27.200
that bung hole whenever I can all day long.
Keep it crisp.
Good,
boom.

338
00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:28.290
Keep it crisp and clean.

339
00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:32.010
Do you think that you would use one of those toilet things?
Hell No.
You wouldn't?

340
00:19:32.370 --> 00:19:35.310
Absolutely not.
You'd see me crapping in the woods.
I mean this one,

341
00:19:35.311 --> 00:19:38.590
the one we have.
Are you kidding me?
That's the most luxurious,
you know,

342
00:19:38.591 --> 00:19:42.420
one of them have ever taken in my life.
There was like a remote control.

343
00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:46.710
That's like the upper echelon of society crap right there.
It's a very fancy,

344
00:19:47.210 --> 00:19:51.240
expensive,
no,
it's not.
I mean,
for what it does,
it's like very,

345
00:19:51.241 --> 00:19:54.970
very valuable.
At first I was confused because there was a couple of [inaudible].

346
00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:59.230
What's it called?
Brah.
Brah.
Brah.
Brah.
I'm dawn.
Yeah,

347
00:20:00.090 --> 00:20:03.000
give,
give them some love.
I think you gave it to us for free too.

348
00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:06.840
There's a remote there too with a bunch of settings.
Bronto.
Yeah.

349
00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:10.320
It's a very nice toilet and that's like a model from like many years ago.

350
00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:14.010
They haven't nailed,
they hadn't nailed like,
oh no,
no,
these are recent.

351
00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:16.620
These are the ones that we bought when we got the studio.
Right.
Yeah.

352
00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:20.190
It wasn't too hot either.
Didn't feel like someone was just sitting there.

353
00:20:20.191 --> 00:20:22.620
You know?
You ever have that experience where it's like,
oh,
that's weird.

354
00:20:23.170 --> 00:20:26.200
There was a,
but just here.
Right.
This is a pleasure that you don't want

355
00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:29.250
to feel good.

356
00:20:29.251 --> 00:20:34.251
I'd rather uninviting him all the backs here as long since abandoned all the

357
00:20:35.251 --> 00:20:38.940
crabs.
Do you,
do you like only crap in certain places or where you go?

358
00:20:38.941 --> 00:20:40.380
Like cars on the road.
You travel a lot.

359
00:20:40.381 --> 00:20:43.310
Like you just got to go when you got a gun.
Do you do what you gotta do?
Yeah.

360
00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:46.580
I'm not scared in public?
No,
not even.

361
00:20:46.590 --> 00:20:49.090
Just being Rogan and like being next to the person who's like,

362
00:20:49.570 --> 00:20:52.090
what are you going to do?
I heard Joe Rogan shitting.

363
00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:57.040
Have you seen the bathrooms like at Venice beach though?
Are you going in there?

364
00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:00.480
Are these public toilets?
Oh,
speech.
Oh,

365
00:21:00.490 --> 00:21:03.580
see whenever you deal then that smell of homeless,

366
00:21:04.090 --> 00:21:06.790
that why no peace Marone that is Rome.

367
00:21:06.850 --> 00:21:10.240
This is a thing where he got pissed so close that people have been wearing

368
00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:15.760
forever.
You know that super ripe,
pungent,
homeless,
crazy person,
smells

369
00:21:17.350 --> 00:21:22.300
smell ever.
It's a weird smell.
Really similar,
but it's real similar.

370
00:21:22.301 --> 00:21:24.640
Like this is what what when you hit,

371
00:21:25.090 --> 00:21:29.410
it's usually a person that's got mental illness and they pissed themselves are

372
00:21:29.411 --> 00:21:34.360
shit themselves and they get this really deep,
horrible odor to them.

373
00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:37.850
Those who don't even know,
but it's so similar.
It's a similar,

374
00:21:37.950 --> 00:21:41.530
it's like saying it's like the same smell,
like be oh like really bad.

375
00:21:41.531 --> 00:21:45.130
Byo is almost always the same kind of smell.
I've been doing this concert.
Right,

376
00:21:46.710 --> 00:21:48.280
exactly what to,
first of all,

377
00:21:48.281 --> 00:21:53.281
that's the main reason why I've never been to a actually I would imagine.

378
00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:56.560
Yeah,
we're just using salt rocks to clean our pitch.

379
00:21:56.561 --> 00:21:58.480
And you found out that modern,

380
00:21:59.470 --> 00:22:02.950
modern industrialized Yoda rand is really just a plot.

381
00:22:03.310 --> 00:22:06.580
It's just a plot and you know what else?
Like furthermore,
to your point,

382
00:22:06.790 --> 00:22:11.460
they really abuse it.
Chemicals and ingredients.
So this is like cruelty free.

383
00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:15.900
Yeah,
free for,
nobody's like offended.
Well they make the product.
Yeah.

384
00:22:15.901 --> 00:22:19.570
You either get it all naturale which is like rocks.

385
00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:23.410
I've seen those things like mineral rocks,
rubbing your armpits

386
00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:27.070
smell like a salty homeless person.

387
00:22:29.330 --> 00:22:32.750
What is this salt in your pits work?
Is that what people do works?

388
00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:37.210
If you don't have a deodorant or anything?
Lemon,
citrus,
you know,

389
00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:42.100
anti bacterial natural.
No Shit.
That makes sense.
I'm a Reagan oil and that,

390
00:22:42.101 --> 00:22:46.300
that's it.
Also antimicrobrial natural antiseptic,

391
00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:49.500
Eucalyptus oil.
Some oil,
some men.

392
00:22:50.550 --> 00:22:53.770
And you're another region.
So that might hurt my heart to coach.
Coach

393
00:22:55.580 --> 00:22:59.680
a soap called defense soap.
It's all made with natural oils

394
00:23:01.330 --> 00:23:05.980
is designed for grapplers cause grapplers get like skin scrap like scratches and

395
00:23:05.981 --> 00:23:10.080
infections and a lot of ringworm and shit bro.

396
00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:13.900
Oh a bunch of times.
I've had ringworm,

397
00:23:14.890 --> 00:23:18.970
I've had staff twice and I had ringworm I think three times,

398
00:23:20.110 --> 00:23:22.600
three times,
cause I've had it on my feet.
But it's basically the same thing.

399
00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:27.700
You get your finger in poop and scratch,
right?
You are a doctor.

400
00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:30.550
Clearly the fuck is wrong.

401
00:23:33.770 --> 00:23:36.820
It's a poop bacteria.
I don't think so.

402
00:23:37.690 --> 00:23:42.670
I think ringworm is just a parasite and it's what happens is it gets through,

403
00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:45.380
I think it gets through broken skin,
scratch skin,

404
00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:50.590
and then it forms this weird ring like a local bullseyes good fucking gross.

405
00:23:51.290 --> 00:23:54.980
I can't,
I can't deal with it.
Like shows like the monsters inside of me.

406
00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:57.110
I don't want to know.
Someone's sent me a link.

407
00:23:57.111 --> 00:23:59.450
It was Josh Wolfe sent me a link about the,

408
00:23:59.630 --> 00:24:03.960
the little like Mites that are in your eyelashes.
I don't want to fuck,

409
00:24:04.510 --> 00:24:07.880
I can't even handle people in their cars and the four or five.

410
00:24:07.910 --> 00:24:10.590
I don't want to know about fucking Mites in my eyelashes.
Mash.

411
00:24:10.610 --> 00:24:13.340
If you could just see on the four or five as you're driving,

412
00:24:13.341 --> 00:24:17.780
how many people have lice lights on the cars?
There should be.

413
00:24:17.781 --> 00:24:20.930
That's the future.
That's what we need.
I don't want to know your followers.

414
00:24:20.931 --> 00:24:23.990
I want to know how many licenses you have in your fucking life is a weird one

415
00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:27.260
because license around when I was a kid and everyone got around,
first of all,

416
00:24:27.261 --> 00:24:30.440
I can't get any more.
Thank you.
I know you're,
you're,
you're immune,

417
00:24:31.190 --> 00:24:35.720
you're impervious to lice.
But when I was a kid,
um,
I was like,

418
00:24:35.721 --> 00:24:37.430
what are they going to figure this thing out?

419
00:24:37.431 --> 00:24:41.450
Because apparently adults don't get it.
Well,

420
00:24:41.670 --> 00:24:42.860
I'll talk to hardly ever have,

421
00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:45.830
it was the last time you had your hair check for lights hanging out,

422
00:24:45.831 --> 00:24:49.490
napping in a kindergarten where the children are riddled with it.
But if I did,

423
00:24:49.491 --> 00:24:52.670
how are the kids getting it?
Cause a role around going head to head,

424
00:24:52.671 --> 00:24:55.280
talking about,
you know,
just gotta be patient zero.

425
00:24:55.370 --> 00:24:57.670
What the fuck's going on with zero?

426
00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:00.710
Some little kid would probably some rich kid whose parents neglect him and he's

427
00:25:00.711 --> 00:25:04.480
had them in there for a long time.
Yeah,
he's got rich lice.
Rice.

428
00:25:07.020 --> 00:25:09.150
That's funny man.

429
00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:15.020
It really does.
It does.
It's kind of a,
it's an amazing,

430
00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:16.970
it's amazing medicine for your brains.

431
00:25:17.210 --> 00:25:20.250
Super Weird when you're not high and you want some people that are and,

432
00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:25.420
and that what's happening right now?
No,
we're both,

433
00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:29.770
all three of us.
Oh that's right.
Jamie's high too.
He's,
yeah,

434
00:25:29.771 --> 00:25:33.890
he's very irresponsible.
Oven mitts on your shirt,
Jamie.
Oh,

435
00:25:33.891 --> 00:25:36.720
that makes me want like a grilled cheese sandwich.
I don't know why.
Yeah,

436
00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:40.310
but is that Johnny cupcakes?
Oh,
cool.
Wouldn't it be amazing?

437
00:25:40.311 --> 00:25:43.370
Have grilled cheese sandwiches were super good for you.
Oh God.

438
00:25:43.371 --> 00:25:47.210
It's my one thing that I just,
it's my food.
Like the one thing,
French fries,

439
00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:52.520
French fries were the shit when they found out that it actually turns your age

440
00:25:52.521 --> 00:25:57.490
back.
The trick does that work
part?

441
00:25:57.530 --> 00:26:00.710
That's the worst.
If you just said the sweet potato fries,
bacon,
you're good.

442
00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:02.480
It's not as bad.
I don't,

443
00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:05.480
I think it depends on what kind of oil you cook it under,

444
00:26:05.481 --> 00:26:07.790
but I think whenever you cook anything in hot oil,

445
00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:11.660
there's something about the way the oil breaks down that your body's like,
what?

446
00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:15.260
I think it gets carcinogenics doesn't it?
I don't know.

447
00:26:15.261 --> 00:26:16.700
But I like when you use big words,

448
00:26:17.980 --> 00:26:20.500
but can you pretend you're a doctor?

449
00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:29.050
Doctors like a hey,
eat French fries.
Doctors.
Like I say,

450
00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:34.100
it's carcinogenic.
Goddamn this health plan.

451
00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:37.850
Fuck you Obama.
Fuck your [inaudible] pay care.

452
00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:40.610
You can't afford healthcare.
Come over to my house.

453
00:26:40.611 --> 00:26:42.110
I'll let you know if you're carcinogenic or not.

454
00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:44.130
There's something real gross about people that are like,

455
00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:47.880
<v 0>oh well gee,
you know,
get better health care.
Go get better healthcare.
Yeah.</v>

456
00:26:47.881 --> 00:26:49.320
Like it's just readily available.

457
00:26:49.321 --> 00:26:51.750
But that's one of the grossest ones when you don't,

458
00:26:51.870 --> 00:26:55.710
you don't feel for fellow citizens and our community that don't have healthcare.

459
00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:58.980
I know I've,
I've,
I didn't have healthcare forever.

460
00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:04.910
<v 3>Go Yo,
I got it a week ago and I booked all the appointments.
Did you everything.</v>

461
00:27:04.911 --> 00:27:08.270
I got the kitty cat checked,
got the teeth checked,
nice eyes.

462
00:27:08.450 --> 00:27:10.520
<v 0>Were you worried about the teeth you have or if you have the feeling like you</v>

463
00:27:10.521 --> 00:27:14.180
have a cavity,
like a phantom cavity,
like,
shit,
why is my tooth hurt?

464
00:27:14.410 --> 00:27:19.220
Don't have a fucking cavities.
I definitely did.
My teeth were like crevasses.

465
00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:20.333
Oh Bye Japanese.

466
00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:23.730
<v 3>Yeah.
She filled me like four times because I haven't been because health is</v>

467
00:27:23.731 --> 00:27:27.720
ridiculous.
No,
I wasn't eating candy.
You got all these holes in your face.

468
00:27:27.750 --> 00:27:30.390
I don't know.
I think like,
you know,
changes in my life.

469
00:27:30.391 --> 00:27:33.240
Maybe I got ringworm from you to change

470
00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:38.020
to change as,

471
00:27:38.770 --> 00:27:42.800
<v 0>yeah.
Little kids get it all the time.
They do.
Oh,
due to the role in dark,</v>

472
00:27:42.801 --> 00:27:44.860
I'm going to blow you away and blow your mind away.
Okay.

473
00:27:45.100 --> 00:27:50.100
Hookworm is super common in the south and it literally diminishes your capacity

474
00:27:51.731 --> 00:27:52.564
for thinking.

475
00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:57.840
So like the idea of drawed southern dumb person Theo.

476
00:27:58.500 --> 00:28:03.340
No,
no,
I'm sorry.
I didn't know she was going to do that.

477
00:28:03.940 --> 00:28:08.560
I would never have her on bro.
You know I love you.
I love you feel,
oh no,

478
00:28:08.561 --> 00:28:09.190
not yet.

479
00:28:09.190 --> 00:28:13.660
But maybe people feel knows relative yet to say that the field bog voice like

480
00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:16.640
maybe a few people that I know.
Yes.
Yeah.

481
00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:20.170
There were all hookworm uh,
victims.
What,

482
00:28:20.171 --> 00:28:23.140
so how do you get hookworm walking around barefoot?
Ah,

483
00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:27.760
I mean there's just too many opportunities to get these worms in your body.
Oh,

484
00:28:27.761 --> 00:28:29.620
for sure.
That's so gross.

485
00:28:29.621 --> 00:28:33.430
When you see dudes who go to like some foreign country and they get scratched

486
00:28:33.431 --> 00:28:34.480
and they come back on a Bot,

487
00:28:34.481 --> 00:28:36.880
flies gluten out of their head and their belly flying.

488
00:28:39.180 --> 00:28:42.790
A kid just died recently in India.

489
00:28:43.450 --> 00:28:47.140
I think it was India.
He got a infection.

490
00:28:47.170 --> 00:28:52.170
He was having headaches and it turns out worms from pig feces had,

491
00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:57.550
they had made it all the way up into his brain and they were making cysts all

492
00:28:57.551 --> 00:29:01.680
throughout his brain.
When he died,
shortly thereafter,

493
00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:06.700
they said it was so bad they couldn't even give him deworming medication because

494
00:29:06.701 --> 00:29:07.730
of they did their award.

495
00:29:07.790 --> 00:29:12.070
His brain would start bleeding and then it would suffer from a stroke.

496
00:29:14.410 --> 00:29:18.750
<v 3>I am not going to sleep tonight.
All is a warm talk that is a team here.</v>

497
00:29:18.810 --> 00:29:21.440
This the cirrhosis,
pulled those pictures out of,
find the pictures,

498
00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:26.320
pictures of the dude's brain just like filled with sis.
Oh God.

499
00:29:26.410 --> 00:29:31.270
Where are we looking at?
Cause we're to high and it's like 10 in the morning.
Oh,

500
00:29:31.271 --> 00:29:34.020
you know what I was saying before I forgot to bring my fanny pack.
You.

501
00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:37.360
You gave me one of your fanny packs and I travel with it everywhere.

502
00:29:37.390 --> 00:29:38.770
Thank you very much.
I'm glad you enjoy it.

503
00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:42.550
It's the most trying to spread the resourceful thing ever.
This is my fanny pack.

504
00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:43.970
I can wear this for rental.

505
00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:47.050
Same one in a couple of people have talked some shit and I was like,

506
00:29:47.051 --> 00:29:51.430
you better step back,
step back,
step back.
I've got my pharmacy in there.

507
00:29:51.431 --> 00:29:54.110
I've got my whole thing so I can be a doctor on the row.

508
00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:57.820
Do you have a stethoscope?
I got a scalpel.
What's up?

509
00:29:58.220 --> 00:30:02.620
<v 4>He complained of having pain in his groin and swelling in his eye and then they</v>

510
00:30:02.621 --> 00:30:04.480
found out he had cysts all over his brain.

511
00:30:04.650 --> 00:30:06.600
<v 3>I mean,
I have pain in my groin every week,</v>

512
00:30:06.601 --> 00:30:10.860
but look at his brain on the,
on the right,

513
00:30:10.861 --> 00:30:12.060
I'm assuming as a result

514
00:30:12.290 --> 00:30:14.420
<v 0>some it's different views of both.
Different use.</v>

515
00:30:14.421 --> 00:30:17.970
Those little holes are all cysts inside of bronc.

516
00:30:18.620 --> 00:30:23.300
His brain is literally imploding.
Although those little spots,

517
00:30:23.330 --> 00:30:26.870
those little white spots,
those are all little cysts inside his brain.

518
00:30:26.900 --> 00:30:31.420
That must have been painful.
Fucking pure agony.
It must be pure.

519
00:30:31.610 --> 00:30:36.410
<v 3>And this was in India,
you said what country was this man was an India.
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

520
00:30:36.650 --> 00:30:41.390
You know,
uh,
fuck that in.
Just imagine like people having,

521
00:30:41.420 --> 00:30:43.520
not the access to healthcare in this country,

522
00:30:43.670 --> 00:30:48.500
but at least we're a little bit modernized being in one of those countries and

523
00:30:48.501 --> 00:30:50.210
being poor.
You're fucked.

524
00:30:50.330 --> 00:30:51.110
<v 0>Yeah,
you really are.</v>

525
00:30:51.110 --> 00:30:55.700
You're so fucked by swallowing microscopic eggs passed in the feces of a person

526
00:30:55.701 --> 00:30:57.660
who has intestinal pork tape.

527
00:30:57.970 --> 00:31:00.770
<v 3>Bye.
Never going to brunch again,
but think about that.</v>

528
00:31:00.771 --> 00:31:05.771
It's not even just pork tapeworm it's the eggs in the shit of a person who has

529
00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:11.380
the tape.
Did you see what God,
Jesus Christ,

530
00:31:11.381 --> 00:31:15.700
Holy Hell is getting your mouth and shit.
I smoked a joint before this shit.

531
00:31:15.701 --> 00:31:17.030
I am in a pure panic attack.

532
00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:23.100
Don't eat ass in India unless that person is on anti tapeworm medication also

533
00:31:23.531 --> 00:31:28.060
never eat ass again.
I mean this is a PSA for anti ass eating.
It is.

534
00:31:28.210 --> 00:31:31.270
I told you I had he cool I a few weeks ago.
Yeah,
that was my life.

535
00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:32.133
Will you saying,
Jamie,

536
00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:35.870
<v 4>the,
there's been a change in the way that the cork industry is going to be doing</v>

537
00:31:35.871 --> 00:31:36.561
inspections at.

538
00:31:36.561 --> 00:31:39.830
The government's going to stop doing it apparently has of like early May and
the,

539
00:31:40.190 --> 00:31:41.750
the industry is now taking over.

540
00:31:41.810 --> 00:31:46.480
<v 3>Oh,
that'll be,
that's a terrible idea there.
That's just exactly what you want.</v>

541
00:31:46.590 --> 00:31:50.790
<v 0>This is one of those things where people that are all in favor of deregulating</v>

542
00:31:50.791 --> 00:31:55.500
everything.
You need to understand this shit like this happens.

543
00:31:55.501 --> 00:31:59.040
If these people cut corners and we know people have cut corners before and maybe

544
00:31:59.041 --> 00:32:01.230
it's not all of them,
maybe most of them are going to be great.

545
00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:04.950
People are going to die.
You're going to get sick,
they're going to get equal.

546
00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:09.060
Are they going to get all sorts of fucked up things 40% and replacing them with

547
00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:10.353
employees,

548
00:32:10.590 --> 00:32:14.670
cutting the number of federal inspectors by about 40% that is such a bad idea.

549
00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:15.031
<v 3>Well,</v>

550
00:32:15.031 --> 00:32:18.630
it looks like America and everywhere is going to get a whole bunch of hookworms.

551
00:32:18.990 --> 00:32:23.940
This is like having the mafia police,
the streets.
This is like taking away,

552
00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:28.860
there'll be no limits on slaughter line speeds.
Oh,
that is so gross.

553
00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:32.070
No one is trying to make it quicker.
Pork is a weird one,

554
00:32:32.071 --> 00:32:36.060
but pork is a weird one is too risky,
man.
It's way too risky.
Not even dad.

555
00:32:36.061 --> 00:32:40.100
I mean they're,
they're fucking smart.
Yeah.
The of the weird things.
I don't like

556
00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:42.590
<v 2>smart like a dog.
They're like a five year old aren't they?</v>

557
00:32:43.140 --> 00:32:48.140
They're maybe not your kid like a five allow shots fired.

558
00:32:48.561 --> 00:32:50.100
Wow.

559
00:32:50.340 --> 00:32:53.870
Doctor fired right into my reproductive heart.

560
00:32:54.180 --> 00:32:57.680
Your five year old would be like,
what do you think he'd be like?
Stoner.

561
00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:04.010
Rude.
Rude.
Ain't good.
Point B route c you're probably right.

562
00:33:04.011 --> 00:33:08.000
I'm sure.
I'm sure you have a great five year old.
My Kid,
it'll be chill.

563
00:33:08.001 --> 00:33:11.120
You know what?
He wouldn't be beaten up your kid.
But he made a very nice,

564
00:33:11.570 --> 00:33:14.840
you'd be surprised.
My parents are hippies.
I know that's true.
I do know that.

565
00:33:14.841 --> 00:33:18.030
Yeah.
My mom's a super hippie so I stepped up.
Um,

566
00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:21.920
but port yet eating pig is weird cause they are very intelligent creature.

567
00:33:22.060 --> 00:33:23.960
They're there until,
but here's the other weird part about it.

568
00:33:23.961 --> 00:33:27.890
You got to kill him because they breed like crazy and in the wild they go nuts.

569
00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:30.440
They're everywhere in the wild.
The tusks grow very fast.

570
00:33:30.441 --> 00:33:33.760
They become those very barbaric,
those tusks.
Oh my.

571
00:33:33.770 --> 00:33:36.420
See that little tray right here?
Yeah,
those pigs are,

572
00:33:36.421 --> 00:33:40.530
they look like that's a wild boar.
Oh,
that's from my,

573
00:33:40.550 --> 00:33:43.550
from Adam Green Tree.
He killed that in Australia.

574
00:33:43.551 --> 00:33:46.880
They have a problem with them in Australia too.
It's wild how,

575
00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:51.860
how hollow it is,
but it's so,
it's so strong.
Even still.
Yeah.

576
00:33:51.861 --> 00:33:52.850
That's a big ass hook.

577
00:33:52.851 --> 00:33:55.750
We should go fishing with this and see what we can catch up a well.
Yeah,

578
00:33:55.890 --> 00:33:58.880
we could definitely cut catch like a humpback or something with this puppy.

579
00:33:59.270 --> 00:34:01.580
It's a weird thing there.

580
00:34:01.581 --> 00:34:06.230
Their teeth or they're shaped like these weird swords that is crazy and they

581
00:34:06.231 --> 00:34:08.810
grow so fast.
If you were at least a pig,
they,
those things,

582
00:34:08.811 --> 00:34:12.100
these things pop out in a couple months.
Yeah.

583
00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:15.440
They start changing when they're not taking care of.
It's like,

584
00:34:15.441 --> 00:34:20.330
it's like a movie with Howie Mandel walk like a man.
Do you remember that?

585
00:34:20.331 --> 00:34:21.920
Where he was like a kind of vaguely,

586
00:34:21.940 --> 00:34:25.610
he was raised by wolves or something that's kind of like almost the equivalent

587
00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:28.700
of him coming back to society is releasing a pig in it becoming wild.

588
00:34:29.030 --> 00:34:31.400
Not that I'm calling Howie Mendell pig,
but he's a nice,

589
00:34:31.401 --> 00:34:33.440
he's just the opposite of a pig.
Very nice gentleman.

590
00:34:33.441 --> 00:34:37.810
But he's also like a super clean,
he's not getting ringworm or hookworm there's,

591
00:34:37.890 --> 00:34:41.360
and he's not getting any of the worms but he might because he like washed his

592
00:34:41.361 --> 00:34:45.900
hands a lot.
Too much.
You can do too much and you kill your skin flora.

593
00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:49.250
You fuck up your phone on flora,
you get the imbalance that's going on here.

594
00:34:49.251 --> 00:34:54.070
What are you showing us?
Oh Man.
Wow.

595
00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:56.690
He's like a dog man is a few.

596
00:34:56.750 --> 00:35:01.610
It was like raised by creatures in the wild and this lady,
cause you know women,

597
00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.640
especially a white ladies trying to like,
you know,
save him.

598
00:35:04.910 --> 00:35:07.160
She wants to save them and do good for him.

599
00:35:07.161 --> 00:35:09.050
And so he's just trying to acclimate to

600
00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:14.980
great stoner movie by the way.
You're using.

601
00:35:15.020 --> 00:35:18.610
This was [inaudible] 89 87

602
00:35:20.450 --> 00:35:23.990
Dell's been around for him around and he looks younger now than he did then.

603
00:35:24.740 --> 00:35:28.160
Dude,
you fucking dudes.
Maybe it's washing your hair.
Maybe it's a good move.

604
00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:33.620
Washing your shaving it.
Oh,
washing your hands.
Yeah,
it probably is a good crazy.

605
00:35:33.630 --> 00:35:37.200
Maybe we're very clean in this society.
We,
you know,

606
00:35:37.201 --> 00:35:41.850
we can't handle like natural bacteria that exist in nature.
It fucks us up.

607
00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:42.300
We're gonna,

608
00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:45.960
we're gonna end up just murdering ourselves because of how clean we are or think

609
00:35:45.990 --> 00:35:46.890
much more likely.

610
00:35:46.891 --> 00:35:50.880
We're going to develop resistant strains of bacteria that are murderers.

611
00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:55.560
We already have a new one that they did just did you see that thing?
Flu Virus.

612
00:35:55.561 --> 00:35:56.940
That's like that article.

613
00:35:57.210 --> 00:36:01.500
There's an article that just came out about a some mysterious infection that's

614
00:36:01.501 --> 00:36:05.550
been Merkin people.
That's cause we're too clean.
We keep,
we should have,

615
00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:09.590
we should bring back the Roman toilets just to level it all out a bit.

616
00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:12.260
Have a couple of them sprinkled around.
Oh,
I don't think that's a good,

617
00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:15.440
just a couple of them.
You know,
like they do one in a parks.

618
00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:17.100
What's the difference between those in a Porta potty?

619
00:36:17.101 --> 00:36:20.100
If you like working on a construction site?
I can't hold a hand in a Porta potty.

620
00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:22.410
Do you ever go to like a music festival?

621
00:36:22.470 --> 00:36:26.310
Fuck now and use one of them in the boonies?
Shit.
That blue liquid.

622
00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:28.470
It's a low point.

623
00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:31.770
I'm not doing that so I can get that warm that Theo's cousins have.

624
00:36:31.830 --> 00:36:35.550
I'm not doing that shit.
Don't do it barefoot and he's showing me Jamie,

625
00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:39.120
what festival are people at the art barefoot.
That's what Dina Horace.

626
00:36:39.121 --> 00:36:43.410
The deadly fungal infection.
Resistant to treatment.

627
00:36:43.411 --> 00:36:44.280
That's what it's called.

628
00:36:46.540 --> 00:36:50.550
Or it sounds like a new solar system.
Unstoppable fungus.

629
00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:55.030
Killing the world's banana supply man.
Addicted to sniffing his separately

630
00:36:58.830 --> 00:37:01.110
man addicted to sniffing stuff.

631
00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:04.630
Develop severe fungal infection.

632
00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:11.670
That is not real.
It's can't be real.
This is like stoner news.

633
00:37:11.940 --> 00:37:13.050
Here's another link.

634
00:37:13.170 --> 00:37:17.150
Cut Socks aren't sexual says Kiwi schools fall down a click bait.

635
00:37:17.151 --> 00:37:18.040
Click hold real quick.

636
00:37:19.150 --> 00:37:22.460
Writing these like Gary Busey who's writing these.

637
00:37:22.980 --> 00:37:25.470
How about what Tim Pool told me,
ready for this.

638
00:37:25.700 --> 00:37:29.220
Do you know those clickbait sites we go to and it's like,

639
00:37:29.420 --> 00:37:31.710
you won't believe what she looks like now,

640
00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:34.920
and then you click on that and then you'd go to another one and she's like never

641
00:37:34.921 --> 00:37:39.180
ending.
Click,
click,
click,
click,
click.
They get,
they gather up all these cliques,

642
00:37:39.210 --> 00:37:44.210
like if they have a site that's responsible for like 400,000 unique clicks a

643
00:37:45.390 --> 00:37:49.290
day,
if they have something like that,
they sell it to another company.

644
00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:54.320
Those clicks and other company attaches those clicks to their site and it says

645
00:37:54.481 --> 00:37:59.340
we get 100,000 views a day,
so they're not real.

646
00:37:59.341 --> 00:38:03.060
They're just a bot or clicks.
You can buy clicks.
Dude,

647
00:38:03.061 --> 00:38:06.660
what world are we in right now by and clicks?
I don't have time.

648
00:38:06.810 --> 00:38:11.550
I don't have time.
Please find out if that's true.
I think it is.
It sounds about,

649
00:38:11.630 --> 00:38:14.640
sure.
I know,
I know what he's saying.
He doesn't lie.
He's a,

650
00:38:14.641 --> 00:38:16.890
and I know a lot of people right now,
like,
Ooh,

651
00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:25.050
people buying likes,
people who have done that or like followers.
It's the same.

652
00:38:25.290 --> 00:38:28.020
Yeah,
the will.
They definitely do that.
There's a way to do that.

653
00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:31.440
People get busted because like they don't have any interactions.
Like,

654
00:38:31.441 --> 00:38:33.560
so they'll put up something and look,

655
00:38:33.570 --> 00:38:36.220
I'll put up a video and the video gets like a thousand views,

656
00:38:36.250 --> 00:38:40.120
but they have like a million followers.
There's no that,

657
00:38:40.210 --> 00:38:42.970
that doesn't make any sense when the engagement doesn't match up with,

658
00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:45.550
I watched people,
all kinds of dumb shit.

659
00:38:46.660 --> 00:38:50.470
The amount of time that I've wasted watching people's Internet videos.
So a,

660
00:38:50.660 --> 00:38:54.060
those little Instagram videos they make talking about their morning.

661
00:38:54.940 --> 00:38:59.040
The thing you posted today about the Florida headline.
Oh man,

662
00:38:59.860 --> 00:39:02.110
that was like the Florida headline for sure.

663
00:39:02.111 --> 00:39:05.490
That was like what you said in the caption.
That was the jet.
I was,
um,

664
00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:09.880
I'm writing this bit about exotic pets and uh,

665
00:39:10.150 --> 00:39:13.720
when I'm in the middle of this bit,
I just decided to start researching.
What,

666
00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:16.780
what inspired you to write?
I'll tell you.
I'll tell you,

667
00:39:16.781 --> 00:39:17.700
I don't want to do the bit,

668
00:39:17.950 --> 00:39:22.950
it was enough to says a Florida man tries to start naked bike club at chick fil

669
00:39:24.010 --> 00:39:24.161
A.

670
00:39:24.161 --> 00:39:28.270
Florida man was arrested after he challenged others to fight and to stare at his

671
00:39:28.271 --> 00:39:30.790
genitals outside of Chick-Filet.
Birdwatcher.

672
00:39:30.890 --> 00:39:35.230
Why did Dan Bilzerian say Florida just can't act right?
Trust me,

673
00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:38.560
that's a good jam at himself.

674
00:39:38.561 --> 00:39:42.490
Points points to Bilzerian or at least come and correct with that money.

675
00:39:42.580 --> 00:39:46.510
That is a ridiculous headline.
Also,
where can I sign up?

676
00:39:46.511 --> 00:39:50.230
It sounds fun.
It's like game of Thrones for Meth,
naked fight club.

677
00:39:51.250 --> 00:39:54.850
You want to go to watch from a neighboring parking lot with binoculars.

678
00:39:55.420 --> 00:39:58.540
That's you want to do.
You don't want to be,
you want to be far enough away.

679
00:39:58.541 --> 00:40:02.700
So if they start running at you,
balls out your

680
00:40:05.740 --> 00:40:10.650
keep your car in park engine running and then use those by knows,
you know,

681
00:40:10.690 --> 00:40:15.220
I shut mine army
with your oven.

682
00:40:15.221 --> 00:40:19.560
Mitt tee shirts.
Gotta be video of that,
right?
If someone was out at a Chick-Filet

683
00:40:23.530 --> 00:40:28.520
depressing fact video video of almost any kind of interaction with

684
00:40:30.070 --> 00:40:33.550
people,
create interactions so that they can videotape them.
Parents,
man,

685
00:40:33.551 --> 00:40:35.950
they've got to stop putting their kids on video.
We've got to stop.

686
00:40:36.010 --> 00:40:37.480
It's enough you say that,

687
00:40:37.510 --> 00:40:41.470
but there's a little kid that's like six years old that reviews toys and he

688
00:40:41.471 --> 00:40:44.920
makes $20 million a year,
$20 million a year.

689
00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:51.340
Just looking at toys all open up a box of toys.
I'll do it.

690
00:40:51.630 --> 00:40:54.750
100 beans.
That's it.
Nobody wants to see you open up to,

691
00:40:54.840 --> 00:40:57.310
you're not a baby and I'm going to find something else to want to see little

692
00:40:57.311 --> 00:41:02.110
cute kids in a diaper.
What?
How's this all going to hell?
Ah,

693
00:41:02.111 --> 00:41:05.490
fuck.
I'm going to find another.
I've got to find another thing to make money.

694
00:41:06.630 --> 00:41:08.830
Find another angle.
Yeah.
That kid.

695
00:41:08.831 --> 00:41:11.890
He's making a lot of money going to be the youtube toy guy.

696
00:41:11.950 --> 00:41:14.770
There's a lady who does it with just her hands of grown woman.

697
00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:18.380
What does she do with her hands?
She opens things up.
Same thing for hands.

698
00:41:18.580 --> 00:41:19.690
I don't know if they're beautiful.

699
00:41:19.691 --> 00:41:22.900
I don't know if their feet out and start using the for fans.
What I to do,

700
00:41:23.530 --> 00:41:26.410
I'm going to open children's toys and my feet.
Is that weird?
No,

701
00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:29.740
you shouldn't do it.
You should do it and see which one gets better views.

702
00:41:30.010 --> 00:41:34.520
Do it with you with painted toenails and doing you with kind of like neglected

703
00:41:34.521 --> 00:41:38.690
Tony neglected toenail.
You know what I'm saying?

704
00:41:38.691 --> 00:41:43.470
Like what little chips in your paint,
you know,
this is a neglected toenail.

705
00:41:43.471 --> 00:41:48.050
Say that it's also kind of hot because it's the kind of chick.

706
00:41:48.051 --> 00:41:51.720
They'll take some chances like
she's like,

707
00:41:52.020 --> 00:41:55.220
she doesn't even have her toenails in order.
She'll abandoned wherever she lives.

708
00:41:55.221 --> 00:41:58.160
She'll move with you across the country.
She's crawling.
She parking lots.

709
00:41:58.161 --> 00:41:59.990
What's she do?
Enter into a bank robbing.

710
00:41:59.991 --> 00:42:03.920
Skiing with you should be taking care of herself.
She's got chipped toenails.

711
00:42:03.980 --> 00:42:06.710
No big deal.
That's a bitch who puts people first.

712
00:42:08.060 --> 00:42:13.030
Just can't get it together.
Some people just never quite get it together.
Yeah,

713
00:42:13.950 --> 00:42:17.060
and then you see their toes and it's a reflection of their own downfalls.

714
00:42:17.390 --> 00:42:20.300
They're their own worst enemy or they have a job.

715
00:42:21.110 --> 00:42:25.190
Busy too busy mom with a job and a couple of kids who's got time to do nails

716
00:42:25.191 --> 00:42:29.360
then unless you,
you know you're a rich white,
you can do it myself.

717
00:42:29.450 --> 00:42:34.070
That's the nail thing is interesting.
Why is that?
Because here's why.

718
00:42:34.071 --> 00:42:37.550
Because it's like a service thing that people love,
right?

719
00:42:37.850 --> 00:42:40.580
Love going and getting pedicures and manicures.

720
00:42:40.581 --> 00:42:43.340
The people that are into that shit.
They love it.
They love Dunkin,

721
00:42:43.341 --> 00:42:48.040
their feed and the thing,
and then they get to talk to each other.
But um,

722
00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:52.010
they would never want to do that.
It's one of those weird things.

723
00:42:52.010 --> 00:42:57.010
It's like if you found out your mom was given strange dudes pedicures,

724
00:42:58.250 --> 00:43:01.790
look,
that's our new gig.
He'd be like,
oh Molly got,
go to therapist.

725
00:43:01.791 --> 00:43:04.580
What's going on?
What?
We'd say,
why do you,
why do you have this job?

726
00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:08.150
Do you really want to clean people's feet?
What?
What about it brings you joy?

727
00:43:08.210 --> 00:43:09.380
Because if you need money,

728
00:43:09.710 --> 00:43:12.680
like you might as well just slice mangos and the side of the highway or

729
00:43:12.681 --> 00:43:13.520
something different.

730
00:43:13.580 --> 00:43:18.580
But it isn't that weird that that's one where people love getting it done but to

731
00:43:18.681 --> 00:43:23.600
do it,
but it'd be like Blah,
well I get my nails done regularly.
I love it.

732
00:43:23.601 --> 00:43:26.750
It's very relaxing.
But yeah,
it's that weird thing where,
you know,

733
00:43:26.751 --> 00:43:27.321
I was saying this,

734
00:43:27.321 --> 00:43:32.300
it's like it's one of those jobs that's worked by non white people for the most

735
00:43:32.301 --> 00:43:34.670
part,
which I think is interesting.
Don't you think that's interesting.

736
00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:36.750
As a woman who's got her nails done,

737
00:43:37.080 --> 00:43:42.080
entry level jobs for people that are first generation immigrant that like what

738
00:43:42.501 --> 00:43:46.520
would happen realistically if all immigrants were moved from this country,

739
00:43:46.650 --> 00:43:49.390
everyone's nails would look like shit and your clothes are terrible.

740
00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:52.280
Then they got rid of all the illegals,
every,

741
00:43:52.281 --> 00:43:56.400
everybody who barely speaks English out.
Restaurants would fall.
Oppressor,

742
00:43:57.360 --> 00:44:01.850
delicious food.
There'd be no fun music.
There would be some fun music stuff.

743
00:44:02.830 --> 00:44:05.600
Let's be honest.
But Chad does a lot of fun.
The most fun music.

744
00:44:05.740 --> 00:44:09.770
There's a lot of fun.
Like it wasn't their idea.
That's true.

745
00:44:10.310 --> 00:44:14.600
Out of fun Latino Music.
That's true.
Not many like songs and like our culture.

746
00:44:14.601 --> 00:44:18.680
Can you do one of these in it?
It fits,
you know?
Especially at like a wedding.

747
00:44:18.710 --> 00:44:23.270
But yeah,
everyone will be jacked up.
Nope.
Good food.
No,
no nails.
Gypsy kings.

748
00:44:23.750 --> 00:44:28.700
I don't know if I know Jim.
Very familiar.
Put It on fuck.
Are you kidding?

749
00:44:28.701 --> 00:44:31.770
There's some,
it's too expensive.
No,
no it's not.

750
00:44:31.771 --> 00:44:34.380
We'll give this yanked from youtube.
Oh,
that's right.
You can't put any music.

751
00:44:34.381 --> 00:44:37.140
I put so content.
I think I just,

752
00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:41.670
somebody sent me a song of Gypsy kings recently.
They've been around forever.

753
00:44:41.700 --> 00:44:42.690
Yeah,
sounds familiar.

754
00:44:43.530 --> 00:44:47.370
Latino band and what I love it is because I can't speak Spanish,

755
00:44:47.670 --> 00:44:51.180
so when they're singing it's just beautiful,
like whatever they're saying,

756
00:44:51.181 --> 00:44:54.150
it just sounds great.
It doesn't have any,
like,

757
00:44:55.110 --> 00:44:58.920
I know there's a motion,
I can feel the guy's emotion when he's singing,

758
00:44:58.921 --> 00:45:02.610
but I have no idea what he's saying so I don't,
I don't need to hear it.

759
00:45:02.611 --> 00:45:07.230
I just love the sound of it.
Nice.
The language is like very melodic.
Oh yeah.

760
00:45:07.231 --> 00:45:11.340
Like Spanish,
Italian heels take Latin based languages are very pretty.

761
00:45:11.340 --> 00:45:13.800
To listen to those little Legos,
a musical flow,

762
00:45:13.801 --> 00:45:16.560
like you ever hear people from Brazil speak Portuguese?

763
00:45:16.730 --> 00:45:20.370
I mean I flick a bean to it all the time.
That shit's of men.
That's shit's sexy.

764
00:45:21.530 --> 00:45:25.560
They have a way of talking.
There's an up and a down.
It's like a little dance.

765
00:45:25.710 --> 00:45:28.890
Yeah,
it is a little dance and people where I'm from like Syracuse,

766
00:45:28.891 --> 00:45:33.450
it's like go get a sandwich.
It's like you just don't want us to talk.

767
00:45:33.510 --> 00:45:34.380
You don't know what it is.

768
00:45:34.381 --> 00:45:38.280
It's actually to trying to keep people from breeding that it's like in the

769
00:45:38.281 --> 00:45:39.790
places that sucked the most.

770
00:45:39.791 --> 00:45:43.080
They have the shittiest accents because they're trying to make it everyone

771
00:45:43.081 --> 00:45:48.020
disgusting.
Well,
I guess I'm not supposed to have a baby then telling it.

772
00:45:48.021 --> 00:45:49.530
They're just chronic limit the numbers.

773
00:45:49.810 --> 00:45:51.930
They don't want overpopulations in places that,

774
00:45:51.931 --> 00:45:56.030
so there's probably some like legitimacy to what you're saying to them aside.

775
00:45:57.020 --> 00:46:01.890
Turn your scientist.
Anybody who needs some advice,
just call us at one 800,

776
00:46:01.930 --> 00:46:06.260
because there's a,
um,
a new documentary by the guy wrote coke,

777
00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:10.140
cocaine cowboys did cocaine cowboys and a bunch of other documentaries.
Uh,

778
00:46:10.141 --> 00:46:14.530
Billy core.
Yup.
Billy court.
Corbin.

779
00:46:14.590 --> 00:46:18.260
You got it.
Oh,
don't,
why did I choke on his lane?

780
00:46:19.740 --> 00:46:24.090
Some water.
Anyway,
Billy has a new documentary called screen a screw ball.

781
00:46:24.360 --> 00:46:28.070
It's all about Alex Rodriguez and the steroid scandal.
And uh,

782
00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:33.390
one of the guys in it is a fake doctor who would wear a stethoscope around his

783
00:46:33.391 --> 00:46:34.810
neck.
Like he got his,

784
00:46:34.820 --> 00:46:39.090
he got his degree in some Janky overseas university.

785
00:46:39.450 --> 00:46:42.180
Wasn't legal to practice medicine in the United States,

786
00:46:42.720 --> 00:46:44.010
but he would call himself a doctor.

787
00:46:44.011 --> 00:46:47.190
And he had like the stethoscope that you'd wear it?
Well,

788
00:46:47.450 --> 00:46:49.980
in his office he'd walk around with a stethoscope around his neck,

789
00:46:49.990 --> 00:46:51.500
like hanging around his neck.
I just to get,

790
00:46:51.630 --> 00:46:53.830
he's going to check your heart and he bought all these dunes prescribing

791
00:46:53.850 --> 00:46:57.350
steroids.
It was amazing.
He's coming.

792
00:46:57.390 --> 00:47:01.470
This kid that was walking around,
he posed as a doctor and had multiple patients.

793
00:47:02.510 --> 00:47:07.110
Yeah,
I remember.
This is in Florida.
Same Plate I guess in Florida too.

794
00:47:07.111 --> 00:47:11.150
You must be pretty easy.
Of course it's in Florida.
Does his name say Malika?

795
00:47:12.240 --> 00:47:15.930
Yeah,
like a creepy name.
That's like children of the corn,
right?
That's like,

796
00:47:15.931 --> 00:47:20.220
how do you pronounce that Malika?
Yeah,
that's,

797
00:47:20.280 --> 00:47:23.040
that is ballsy dude.
Whoa.
Wait a minute.
That's not his real name.

798
00:47:23.430 --> 00:47:28.430
Merit Malakai love Robinson maybe sounds like a character from like some sort of

799
00:47:29.710 --> 00:47:33.840
porno.
There he is.
Dr Malakai,
a robberies,
he fat

800
00:47:34.040 --> 00:47:38.690
<v 0>d h h p Dash c a m p Dash TV</v>

801
00:47:38.770 --> 00:47:42.080
<v 2>Dan or all those things,
HIV.
What are all those other things that he is?</v>

802
00:47:42.310 --> 00:47:45.260
Health care proxy,
maybe some bullshit amp.

803
00:47:45.350 --> 00:47:48.080
I don't know what the hell that sounds like.
A gas station in Kansas

804
00:47:48.440 --> 00:47:49.870
<v 0>read his,
his thing.</v>

805
00:47:49.900 --> 00:47:54.900
Let's all it says is a wealthy doctor Malakai a love Robinson is a well rounded

806
00:47:55.521 --> 00:47:59.690
professional that treats and cares for patients using a system of practice that

807
00:47:59.691 --> 00:48:04.370
basis treatment on physiological functions and abnormal conditions on natural

808
00:48:04.371 --> 00:48:07.090
laws governing the human body.
That doesn't even,

809
00:48:07.130 --> 00:48:11.540
that's how run on or sentence you missed it.
Hold on a second.

810
00:48:12.650 --> 00:48:16.070
Dr. Love Robinson utilizes physiological,
psychological,

811
00:48:16.071 --> 00:48:20.300
and mechanical methods such as air,
water,
light,
heat,
earth,

812
00:48:20.530 --> 00:48:24.260
photo therapy,
food and herbs,
therapy,

813
00:48:24.290 --> 00:48:29.060
psychotherapy,
electro therapy,
physiotherapy,
mechano therapy,

814
00:48:29.061 --> 00:48:33.710
natural path corrections and manipulation and natural methods or modalities

815
00:48:33.711 --> 00:48:35.930
together with natural medicines,

816
00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:40.090
natural process foods and herbs and nature's remedies.
Cool.

817
00:48:40.300 --> 00:48:43.990
<v 2>Oh,
what you just said?
The only thing that was true about that was manipulation.</v>

818
00:48:45.130 --> 00:48:49.810
Well,
how was this guy like?
Who,
who read that and went,
all right.
Yeah,

819
00:48:50.020 --> 00:48:52.660
we're in.
Yeah.
Who read that was like,
I need to make an appointment.

820
00:48:52.661 --> 00:48:54.610
Immediately found the real doctor.

821
00:48:54.820 --> 00:48:57.580
All this other bullshit doctors that don't use manipulation.

822
00:48:59.410 --> 00:49:02.320
What doctor goes like this and a photo.
All of them.

823
00:49:02.321 --> 00:49:04.480
Now imagine that became the new thing.

824
00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:08.800
I would not go to that doctor [inaudible] he had offices so someone had to like

825
00:49:08.801 --> 00:49:13.801
rent him the spot so they believed him to not just the kidney offices or he at

826
00:49:14.681 --> 00:49:17.040
least had an off a office,
like an office.

827
00:49:17.041 --> 00:49:20.500
You kind of think a guy who's that good of a bullshitter that pretends to be a

828
00:49:20.501 --> 00:49:24.280
doctor actually gets patients,
got a stethoscope,
got a website.

829
00:49:24.600 --> 00:49:26.260
Is it that good?
Well,

830
00:49:26.261 --> 00:49:30.550
it's good enough that he's got patients like it actually worked.

831
00:49:30.580 --> 00:49:34.540
Like imagine being so crazy that you tell everybody you're a doctor,

832
00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:37.510
you don't know shit about medical medical practices.

833
00:49:37.540 --> 00:49:41.170
You know you read his little bio there and you get offices and then you get

834
00:49:41.171 --> 00:49:44.470
patients.
Are you treating patients?
It's the same as like religion.

835
00:49:45.460 --> 00:49:47.170
It's a similar,
it's a similar approach.

836
00:49:47.171 --> 00:49:50.440
You just find people who are in need and who needs something and they're

837
00:49:50.441 --> 00:49:52.660
gullible and they're vulnerable and they'll follow you anywhere.

838
00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:57.130
Or religion is either that or it's a part of your culture.
Yeah,
right.

839
00:49:57.160 --> 00:49:59.530
You're born into it.
Absolutely.
It's a cultural thing for sure.

840
00:49:59.560 --> 00:50:03.130
It's when you hear a lot about a 45 year old dude becoming a Mormon,

841
00:50:03.131 --> 00:50:06.290
they're like,
Huh?
You're like,
what?
What,
what happened?
What are you doing?

842
00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:07.150
Your loss.

843
00:50:07.150 --> 00:50:11.410
Maybe just have a great group of people that are all some Mormons you cite.

844
00:50:11.411 --> 00:50:13.750
Fuck it,
I'll join.
I guess what would happen,
you know,

845
00:50:13.800 --> 00:50:16.090
maybe even like with Scientologists what happens with people like,

846
00:50:16.091 --> 00:50:16.901
especially in Hollywood,

847
00:50:16.901 --> 00:50:20.470
they just get so desensitized or like they get everything they want and they're

848
00:50:20.471 --> 00:50:23.320
looking for more.
I need purpose.
If I was jaded,

849
00:50:23.380 --> 00:50:26.500
I would say that they think they're going to enhance their career.
You think so?

850
00:50:26.680 --> 00:50:27.513
I used to think that

851
00:50:28.610 --> 00:50:29.900
<v 0>because there's a lot of,
like,</v>

852
00:50:29.901 --> 00:50:33.550
there was at least a lot of people in the film industry that were Scientologists

853
00:50:33.560 --> 00:50:37.280
right.
And I've gone to a meeting,
no,
but I did go to one of those.
Um,
they,

854
00:50:37.460 --> 00:50:40.010
they had like a conference tables,

855
00:50:40.040 --> 00:50:44.870
a folding table set up in San Diego and they had like the,
the two,
uh,

856
00:50:44.930 --> 00:50:48.680
coffee cans with the strings on them that you hold on to God and you know,

857
00:50:48.681 --> 00:50:51.860
like they ask you questions about your childhood and weird stuff and then you

858
00:50:51.861 --> 00:50:56.180
say it into the coffee can no,
you hold these things.
It's called,
it's called,

859
00:50:56.600 --> 00:51:00.530
what's it called?
An eater.
Thanks so loud.
It's called an e meter.

860
00:51:00.590 --> 00:51:03.710
You hold onto it and it,
um,
it,
it,

861
00:51:03.790 --> 00:51:07.340
it gives you some sort of a reading on this fucking graph that's,

862
00:51:07.630 --> 00:51:11.030
it's totally nonscientific tore shit.
Right.
But you know,
the guy who was,

863
00:51:11.090 --> 00:51:13.360
it was really interesting because the guy who was doing it,

864
00:51:13.470 --> 00:51:18.470
it must be just like some regular dude who's in the church that they make do it.

865
00:51:19.250 --> 00:51:21.430
It's not like he wants to do it.
Nobody wants you to do that.

866
00:51:21.460 --> 00:51:24.990
You could tell he was like a volunteer cause he was like,
yeah,
maybe.

867
00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:26.870
Maybe you have a problem with your dad or something.
Huh.

868
00:51:28.220 --> 00:51:33.060
<v 3>He wasn't really selling it at all.
So basically how I am as a doctor.
Right.</v>

869
00:51:34.210 --> 00:51:38.980
He was killing the Scientology.
Yeah.
As a side,
push it.
See what it's like.

870
00:51:39.400 --> 00:51:42.010
Just out of curiosity,
just to be in there,
you know,

871
00:51:42.011 --> 00:51:44.230
in that moment and see what the hype is about.

872
00:51:44.670 --> 00:51:48.030
<v 0>Well,
there's a lot of money,
right?
You have to think the date.</v>

873
00:51:48.100 --> 00:51:50.100
They're massive real estate holders.
They,

874
00:51:50.101 --> 00:51:54.900
they've earned millions of millions dogs and they have tax free exempt status

875
00:51:55.110 --> 00:51:59.820
because it's a religion.
Yeah.
Tax exempt taxes.
Oh,
it's crazy.

876
00:51:59.821 --> 00:52:03.300
They sued and won it.
Yeah.
They sued the IRS.

877
00:52:03.430 --> 00:52:05.740
<v 3>See,
this is the problem where on one side of the coin,</v>

878
00:52:06.190 --> 00:52:08.560
like people are good manipulators.
On the other side,

879
00:52:08.800 --> 00:52:13.800
people are idiotic to believe in deal with half of the shit that they believe

880
00:52:14.171 --> 00:52:16.490
in,
deal with should.
I think they're there.

881
00:52:16.810 --> 00:52:19.060
<v 0>Bunch of different things at once.
You know,</v>

882
00:52:19.210 --> 00:52:22.690
there's the wacky beliefs that l Ron Hubbard,
all that stuff that he created,

883
00:52:22.840 --> 00:52:24.460
but then there's also the clan,

884
00:52:25.020 --> 00:52:29.900
<v 3>like a mentality,
right.
For tribal mentality.
Yeah,
absolutely.</v>

885
00:52:30.010 --> 00:52:34.030
<v 0>It's funny that the Ku Klux Klan,
they kind of stole the word clan,
right?</v>

886
00:52:34.060 --> 00:52:36.370
Like the word cloud.
You say it,
you get self conscious,

887
00:52:36.480 --> 00:52:39.030
you know it's the correct word for like a tribe of people.

888
00:52:39.100 --> 00:52:43.510
<v 3>Right.
And it's not,
it does not reserve for just oh,
group of white supremacists.</v>

889
00:52:43.511 --> 00:52:47.440
I mean it,
it definitely indicates a whole bunch of groups of people.

890
00:52:47.530 --> 00:52:50.050
<v 0>Look,
I,
I used to play quake competitively.</v>

891
00:52:50.051 --> 00:52:53.110
If you tell people how quick teams are that their clans,

892
00:52:53.140 --> 00:52:54.670
the quick people like what?

893
00:52:54.940 --> 00:52:57.870
<v 3>And then they were like,
you mean like the KKK?
You're language?
No,</v>

894
00:52:57.880 --> 00:53:02.170
just a group of people like quake.
You fucking idiot with a common mentality.

895
00:53:02.171 --> 00:53:05.920
That's it.
Oh,
a group.
A band of people.
A band.
Yeah.
Brothers

896
00:53:06.710 --> 00:53:07.170
<v 0>pins.</v>

897
00:53:07.170 --> 00:53:10.260
People just take over something and then that's something becomes negative from

898
00:53:10.261 --> 00:53:10.810
then on.

899
00:53:10.810 --> 00:53:12.710
<v 3>Well then they have a platform as well,
you know,
they,</v>

900
00:53:12.711 --> 00:53:16.570
but they can then they're like social social justice warriors about it,
you know,

901
00:53:16.571 --> 00:53:20.380
they're like cheering it from the rooftops and making tweets about it and how,

902
00:53:20.740 --> 00:53:25.040
how it's a fucked up situation are they're really doing that.
Well,
you know,

903
00:53:25.170 --> 00:53:25.980
when you,
if you

904
00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:29.910
<v 2>were to say any word,
people are like,
oh my God,
this person said this.</v>

905
00:53:29.970 --> 00:53:34.770
It's racist.
It's like I was just saying clan.
I wasn't saying anything else,

906
00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:39.540
but it's like the Hitler mustache.
You just gotta let it go.
It's too tricky.

907
00:53:40.240 --> 00:53:43.490
It is.
Anybody who wants to wear the Hitler mustache now,

908
00:53:43.540 --> 00:53:48.420
like you can't really,
you can't.
Who wants to wear it?
Is there,

909
00:53:48.450 --> 00:53:51.450
is somebody wearing it for a while?
That's right.
He did.

910
00:53:52.440 --> 00:53:54.650
Daddy did playing basketball.
That's kind of fine.

911
00:53:54.651 --> 00:53:58.000
Or if he was playing basketball,
he wasn't,
he was retired.

912
00:53:58.350 --> 00:54:02.400
Hanes commercial or something.
I think.
Oh my God.
Damn Hitler.

913
00:54:02.850 --> 00:54:06.990
You can't brazen.
You can't even like,
when does it become a Charlie Chaplin?

914
00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:10.830
It starts as a Hitler.
Like when it gets to the outer edge of the nostrils.

915
00:54:10.890 --> 00:54:13.750
Is it a Charlie Chaplin?
What Charlie Chaplin had a Hitler.
He,
he might,

916
00:54:13.770 --> 00:54:17.580
he molded it after modeled after Hitler.
Yeah.

917
00:54:17.581 --> 00:54:21.330
Hitler was a huge fan of Chaplin.
Absolutely.
There's,

918
00:54:21.360 --> 00:54:24.420
there's some crossover there.
And chaplain was a huge fan of Hitler.

919
00:54:24.750 --> 00:54:28.710
Hitler was a fan of Chaplin,
right?
In chaplain.
Just kind of,
you know,

920
00:54:28.711 --> 00:54:32.010
cause Chapman was a little bit of a rebel man.
So why the chaplain?

921
00:54:32.020 --> 00:54:34.410
Where's mustache?
A little tongue in cheek.

922
00:54:34.560 --> 00:54:38.560
How Michael Jordan or mustache boosted sales at hand.

923
00:54:39.450 --> 00:54:44.280
Let me see that photo.
Wow.
Larger.
That is so crazy.

924
00:54:44.850 --> 00:54:48.900
That is so crazy.
That is wild.

925
00:54:49.610 --> 00:54:53.180
<v 0>Give it up.
Even Michael motherfucking Jordan.</v>

926
00:54:53.181 --> 00:54:54.920
What does that second paragraph say?

927
00:54:55.460 --> 00:55:00.230
Jordan camouflage is the mustaches to a small extent with a corresponding soul

928
00:55:00.231 --> 00:55:04.280
patch under his bottom lip.
But the lip beard appears to be exactly that.

929
00:55:04.310 --> 00:55:08.960
A beard trying to disguise the two tonic neighbor upstairs sentence.

930
00:55:09.440 --> 00:55:10.040
Yeah,
that's a great,

931
00:55:10.040 --> 00:55:13.790
that's a great sentence to tonic neighbor to tonic neighbor that's really know

932
00:55:13.791 --> 00:55:16.730
what to tonic means.
Do you know what to tonic means?
I've never used that word.

933
00:55:16.731 --> 00:55:21.030
Capitalized it.
Hit it.
Hit it.
Maybe like a probably cause it's not a real word.

934
00:55:21.050 --> 00:55:25.040
Motherfucker thinks it's a domain war or something like some.
Okay.

935
00:55:25.041 --> 00:55:28.880
Let's see what says relating to towns relating to two tones,

936
00:55:28.910 --> 00:55:33.500
denoting dramatic branch of the Indo European language.
Family definition.

937
00:55:33.501 --> 00:55:38.300
You're like,
what's the tonic?
So go back to that.
Go back to that statement again.

938
00:55:40.570 --> 00:55:45.230
That's the statement.
Oh,
they were just reading from,
yeah.
Okay.

939
00:55:45.590 --> 00:55:49.310
Choose a beer.
Trying to disguise as to tonic neighbor upstairs.
How's that?

940
00:55:49.610 --> 00:55:51.220
<v 2>Maybe those people wore those stashes.</v>

941
00:55:51.221 --> 00:55:55.030
Maybe Hitler got it from those people because it's dramatic,
right?
Yeah.
But like,

942
00:55:55.031 --> 00:55:58.540
who's the loading?
A dramatic,
maybe it was a dramatic mustache.
Yeah,

943
00:55:58.541 --> 00:56:01.090
maybe it was all a mode of the times.
Yeah.

944
00:56:01.120 --> 00:56:04.030
I mean maybe a bunch of people at Hitler's kind of like how there's full beards

945
00:56:04.031 --> 00:56:05.920
now.
This is like as a full beard.

946
00:56:05.921 --> 00:56:09.520
The Hitler of ours is just like a common beard.

947
00:56:10.870 --> 00:56:13.870
Can you imagine if somebody wrote what rolled around with a Hitler mustache

948
00:56:13.871 --> 00:56:18.070
today?
That'd be really wild.
You can't,
you can't,
that's too much.
Right?

949
00:56:18.300 --> 00:56:21.040
But here's what's weird,
and I've talked about this on stage too.

950
00:56:21.041 --> 00:56:24.070
Why is it okay to dress Gingiss con

951
00:56:24.730 --> 00:56:27.850
<v 3>who's dressing like gang is con.
If she want to do it for Halloween,</v>

952
00:56:28.630 --> 00:56:32.170
why is it okay?
Yeah.
What do you mean?
Like it shouldn't be okay.
Yeah.

953
00:56:32.200 --> 00:56:35.230
Being a Nazi,
you can't be Hitler.
Yeah,
that's,
I mean,

954
00:56:35.231 --> 00:56:39.100
that's just like won't let you,
well,
it's also kind of lacking creativity.

955
00:56:39.101 --> 00:56:41.650
Like you want to be a Hitler.
It's like dressing up like a sexy baby.

956
00:56:41.710 --> 00:56:46.480
Are we really doing this?
Is this necessary?
No one needs to see sexy babies.

957
00:56:46.481 --> 00:56:48.970
No one needs to see a Hitler.
Well,
slow your roll.

958
00:56:49.750 --> 00:56:52.230
Some girls should definitely dress like a sexy baby.

959
00:56:53.260 --> 00:56:54.760
Girls can dress like sexy babies,

960
00:56:54.761 --> 00:56:57.790
but I can't dress like a baby and open up packages on youtube.

961
00:56:58.320 --> 00:57:01.860
<v 0>You could just like a baby and open up packages on youtube.
No one's stopping.</v>

962
00:57:01.861 --> 00:57:04.230
You want to look funny?
Do and visible foes.

963
00:57:04.300 --> 00:57:06.970
<v 3>Cause you just said that it would be Q and now before.</v>

964
00:57:06.971 --> 00:57:09.470
It wasn't when I wanted to do it.
I don't know what you're talking about.

965
00:57:11.330 --> 00:57:13.230
I don't think you're serious.
I wasn't.
No,

966
00:57:13.231 --> 00:57:17.710
I wasn't so cut to this afterwards and it's just 10 videos of me opening up

967
00:57:18.010 --> 00:57:22.480
packages of toys.
Yeah,
they'll just cereal.
Yeah.
In your underwear.

968
00:57:22.690 --> 00:57:24.550
In my underwear.
Yeah.
Fucked up

969
00:57:26.380 --> 00:57:29.290
with my terrible,
terrible chip toenails.

970
00:57:29.910 --> 00:57:34.640
<v 0>Yeah.
It's amazing how many people have created a career just reviewing stuff on,</v>

971
00:57:34.730 --> 00:57:37.380
on youtube,
like a,
those tech review guys,

972
00:57:37.460 --> 00:57:42.210
they make a shitload of money and even have to have like degrees in electronics

973
00:57:42.211 --> 00:57:45.480
or an engineering or anything.
They just have to have a love of tech.

974
00:57:45.660 --> 00:57:48.930
Like our friend.
Uh,
well unbox therapy.
First of all,
Louis.

975
00:57:49.150 --> 00:57:52.980
I think about how many views those videos get his videos.

976
00:57:53.610 --> 00:57:54.630
He's one of the top ones,

977
00:57:54.631 --> 00:57:57.810
but there's Marcus Brownley who's also been on here for you guys on there.

978
00:57:57.811 --> 00:58:02.310
At least that are doing it.
Not Dunkin.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's,

979
00:58:02.430 --> 00:58:03.240
what are they getting right?

980
00:58:03.240 --> 00:58:06.990
<v 3>What does it like as a viewer to watch somebody else opened gifts.
It's like,</v>

981
00:58:07.230 --> 00:58:09.920
that's like the worst part of Christmas morning watching other people opened

982
00:58:09.921 --> 00:58:14.040
gifts.
You're like,
where the hell are my toys?
People get really into it.
They do.

983
00:58:14.050 --> 00:58:15.600
It's bizarre.
It's bizarre.

984
00:58:15.860 --> 00:58:19.720
<v 0>Flossy Carter is my favorite.
I've been,
there's a thing.
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

985
00:58:19.830 --> 00:58:23.990
He's a Jack Black Guy.
He looks like a,
like a power lifter.
Yeah.

986
00:58:24.930 --> 00:58:28.240
Tattoos on his hands full out.
Yeah.
Right.
And,

987
00:58:28.410 --> 00:58:30.860
and he uses like a w w,

988
00:58:31.110 --> 00:58:36.110
w he and he uses technical terms mixed in with like slang and he has a cat.

989
00:58:38.070 --> 00:58:39.300
He's got a cool little cat.

990
00:58:39.301 --> 00:58:43.020
It's always like in the videos nagging him and he opened,
he's an unboxing.
Yeah.

991
00:58:43.021 --> 00:58:45.300
He's so super knowledgeable guy when he,

992
00:58:45.330 --> 00:58:48.480
when he breeds like when he's talking about like the different details and what

993
00:58:48.510 --> 00:58:52.940
the camera's doing dog.
But he does it in a funny way.
Like he's very funny.
Yeah.

994
00:58:53.110 --> 00:58:56.160
In,
in it it's like also knowledgeable.

995
00:58:56.161 --> 00:58:58.710
So if you're a dork like me and your intellect,
phone,

996
00:58:58.711 --> 00:59:01.170
technology and I'm willing to phone technology,

997
00:59:01.171 --> 00:59:04.020
I'm always fascinated by innovations and phone technology.

998
00:59:04.260 --> 00:59:07.580
Cause it's like I'm watching someone build a bomb standard back,
right?

999
00:59:07.590 --> 00:59:10.230
Where the fuck are they going next?
Where is this going next?

1000
00:59:10.560 --> 00:59:13.140
This has ruined us now they want to make them faster and better.

1001
00:59:13.141 --> 00:59:16.680
And Morton is he all hands to like she was saying?
Yeah,
he's all hands.
Yes,
yes.

1002
00:59:16.740 --> 00:59:18.900
Hands on.
So this is,
this is flossy Carter.

1003
00:59:18.901 --> 00:59:23.450
Shout out to philosophy as far as the lightweight,
super comfortable.

1004
00:59:23.540 --> 00:59:26.630
You can easily wear these all day.
And for the look,

1005
00:59:27.230 --> 00:59:30.070
this is what we're going to look like when you're wearing them.
Neck tattoos,

1006
00:59:30.080 --> 00:59:33.050
40 fucking silly,
but some people like them.
Some people don't.

1007
00:59:33.620 --> 00:59:37.430
These really ate my cup of tea.
Now what I am,
he's got big hands.

1008
00:59:37.940 --> 00:59:40.970
Big manly hand.
Well,
he's a,
there's pictures of him on his Instagram.

1009
00:59:40.971 --> 00:59:44.840
He's jacked like he,
he lifts weights.
He's huge.
What's his background?

1010
00:59:44.870 --> 00:59:45.703
I don't know.

1011
00:59:46.500 --> 00:59:51.500
10,753,495 views or his top 10 truly wireless earphones.

1012
00:59:54.200 --> 00:59:55.580
He's got a huge following,

1013
00:59:55.610 --> 00:59:58.130
but it's because of that because he knows what he's talking about,

1014
00:59:58.131 --> 01:00:00.720
but then on top of knowing when he talks about,
it's kind of fun to listen to.

1015
01:00:00.820 --> 01:00:05.240
<v 3>Yeah.
His voice is interesting.
His voice.
The major.
Major Room.
Yeah.
That's voices.</v>

1016
01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:09.220
Full.
Powerful voice.
You should do a Ted talk.
There's so many of the boys

1017
01:00:09.310 --> 01:00:13.900
<v 0>fellows out there that are carving their own niche and gals reviewing things,</v>

1018
01:00:13.901 --> 01:00:17.260
talking about things like there's so many different people doing shit like that

1019
01:00:17.261 --> 01:00:17.930
now.

1020
01:00:17.930 --> 01:00:21.620
<v 3>I guess it makes sense because there's such a huge space for the techie nerds to</v>

1021
01:00:21.770 --> 01:00:24.330
indulge in that stuff and become fans of that sort of,

1022
01:00:24.350 --> 01:00:27.500
well also no one would have ever made that a television show.

1023
01:00:27.530 --> 01:00:30.590
And if it was a television show,
people might not have watched it.
Yeah.

1024
01:00:30.740 --> 01:00:34.010
It's one of the air on,
on Youtube where you can just click it.
Yeah.
At your,

1025
01:00:34.011 --> 01:00:36.560
at your leisure.
That's the beautiful thing about the on demand.

1026
01:00:36.561 --> 01:00:38.480
It was tech TV though,
which is show on,

1027
01:00:38.481 --> 01:00:41.060
so it's the sort of just replaced whatever.
Yeah.

1028
01:00:41.061 --> 01:00:45.230
But Tech TV was never this in depth.
They would go,
you know,

1029
01:00:45.350 --> 01:00:49.230
they would gloss over things.
So they would have like a synopsis of,

1030
01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:52.040
it was still TV.
They still had,
you know,
they started,
did I commercials?

1031
01:00:52.041 --> 01:00:55.400
I guess they were,
they did everything right.
Like a television show.
It was great.

1032
01:00:55.401 --> 01:00:58.850
I would love remote control.
I mean,
not remote control.
What was it called?

1033
01:00:58.851 --> 01:01:02.210
I'm tech screensavers.
Remote control was the MTV show.
I was just looking at it.

1034
01:01:02.310 --> 01:01:06.890
I thought that was old Jenny Mccarthy and Chris Hardware.
Hard way.

1035
01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:10.340
Chris Hardwick wasn't,
yeah,
he had a couple extra lps on them.
Yeah.

1036
01:01:10.341 --> 01:01:13.730
You need a soul patch then as well?
Yeah,
he had it like a downstairs Hitler.

1037
01:01:14.270 --> 01:01:16.880
Hitler in the basement is what?
They're allowed to have a Hitler in the basement.

1038
01:01:17.160 --> 01:01:19.460
In the basement.
Just not in the attic.
It's too close.

1039
01:01:19.530 --> 01:01:21.450
<v 0>But isn't it weird though that,
I mean,</v>

1040
01:01:21.451 --> 01:01:23.790
not saying that anybody wants to dress like a Nazi?
I don't,

1041
01:01:23.791 --> 01:01:27.690
I don't want to just have to say that.
I have to say that.
Uh,

1042
01:01:27.691 --> 01:01:32.490
but that if you dressed like a murderer from the past,

1043
01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:34.560
like Gingiss con or something like that,

1044
01:01:34.860 --> 01:01:37.200
well you actually get in trouble now for cultural

1045
01:01:37.210 --> 01:01:39.490
<v 3>appropriation.
You know,
where you wouldn't get in trouble.</v>

1046
01:01:39.790 --> 01:01:44.600
Is it the renaissance fair when they have like heroes and villains day goes on?

1047
01:01:44.780 --> 01:01:48.240
What you're doing right there,
you got some squinty eyes

1048
01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:53.230
too far,
right.
And then we're taking it too far.

1049
01:01:53.530 --> 01:01:56.920
<v 0>Well,
why is it weird that a physical characteristic like eyes,</v>

1050
01:01:57.100 --> 01:02:00.800
like small eyes is like offensive to discuss is that

1051
01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:04.040
<v 3>it is fascinating,
but I had to recreate,
I think.</v>

1052
01:02:04.970 --> 01:02:09.050
Is it offensive or is it people enjoy the feeling of being offended?

1053
01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:11.190
I think there's a,
there's a sweet spot in the middle of there.

1054
01:02:11.720 --> 01:02:15.440
I would beg to differ that some of the people in society who are offended by

1055
01:02:15.441 --> 01:02:15.951
words,

1056
01:02:15.951 --> 01:02:20.951
term sentences aren't necessarily truly offended as much as they want to say

1057
01:02:21.301 --> 01:02:24.890
they're offended.
I am 100% on board with you.
So

1058
01:02:26.820 --> 01:02:29.250
doctor Peluso.
Sorry.
All right,
thank you doctor Peluso.

1059
01:02:29.251 --> 01:02:33.540
I have a HPB HD Phi Abd.

1060
01:02:36.150 --> 01:02:40.380
I can't,
I mean,
people get up,
they love it.
They love getting offended.

1061
01:02:40.381 --> 01:02:43.630
And you know what?
They also love doing?
Not doing shit about it,

1062
01:02:44.210 --> 01:02:46.490
<v 0>but in their defense,</v>

1063
01:02:47.510 --> 01:02:52.510
if you see like a movie where a dude is playing an Asian man,

1064
01:02:54.380 --> 01:02:58.910
but he's a white dude and they do some malarkey with his eyes like mother

1065
01:02:59.050 --> 01:03:03.310
<v 3>fucker.
He said,
what did he turn him into?</v>

1066
01:03:03.311 --> 01:03:06.190
A leprechaun,
something Irish some way.
Charlie Chan,

1067
01:03:08.040 --> 01:03:09.050
the fucking murder,

1068
01:03:10.380 --> 01:03:14.470
that special effects Malarkey and changed and went to a Chinaman.
Oh,

1069
01:03:14.471 --> 01:03:16.780
I that Goddamn Leprechaun.
That fucker.

1070
01:03:17.080 --> 01:03:18.370
<v 0>You could be an Englishman.</v>

1071
01:03:18.430 --> 01:03:20.800
No one has a problem with calling someone in English when we call someone a

1072
01:03:20.801 --> 01:03:23.860
Chinaman and no,
whoa,
you're getting weird there.

1073
01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:25.133
<v 3>Yes.</v>

1074
01:03:25.430 --> 01:03:29.630
It's exhausting when people are offended and then it's like girls being offended

1075
01:03:29.631 --> 01:03:33.140
and writing articles about guys that are doing me too moments,

1076
01:03:33.141 --> 01:03:35.030
but they're not going to the vet,
the rallies,

1077
01:03:35.031 --> 01:03:37.160
they're not involved in the community.

1078
01:03:37.161 --> 01:03:40.400
They're not really like moving the needle there,
just screaming.

1079
01:03:40.670 --> 01:03:41.870
Is it good to go to rallies?

1080
01:03:42.140 --> 01:03:45.650
I think it's good to be also actively and physically involved in whatever

1081
01:03:45.651 --> 01:03:46.760
movement you believe in.

1082
01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:50.570
I think just saying it and posting it on Twitter is a facade,

1083
01:03:50.630 --> 01:03:53.360
but it's good for likes.
You can get a lot of likes.
Boom.

1084
01:03:54.200 --> 01:03:56.000
I mean I guess there's some eyeballs on it.
You're,

1085
01:03:56.001 --> 01:03:59.870
you're creating a conversation,
but I don't know.
I just believe in like living,

1086
01:03:59.900 --> 01:04:00.800
walking the talk

1087
01:04:01.190 --> 01:04:05.510
<v 0>a little bit more.
What the fuck were we just talking about?
The gangs calm.</v>

1088
01:04:06.020 --> 01:04:06.853
Oh,

1089
01:04:07.010 --> 01:04:11.210
Chinese actors that get fucked out of roles by white people.

1090
01:04:11.240 --> 01:04:13.790
They don't do that anymore,
but they used to.
Yeah.

1091
01:04:13.870 --> 01:04:16.550
One of the big ones was Charlie Chan.

1092
01:04:16.910 --> 01:04:21.150
Charlie Chan was like a famous detective show.
Remember that show?
Was it?

1093
01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:23.240
But was it cast it as a white man?

1094
01:04:23.330 --> 01:04:28.250
It was a white dude playing a Chinese detective that was like super wise

1095
01:04:28.251 --> 01:04:30.920
detective that's busted.
But he looks like,

1096
01:04:31.110 --> 01:04:34.090
you know like a white guy eats good like Matlock.

1097
01:04:36.230 --> 01:04:39.000
More like a commish.
No,
like that's,

1098
01:04:39.120 --> 01:04:43.820
that's my holy hell.
Yeah,

1099
01:04:43.821 --> 01:04:46.610
that was Charlie Chan.
I'm offended.
Yeah,
he should be.

1100
01:04:47.030 --> 01:04:50.010
He looks more like he looks like a shitty magician.

1101
01:04:50.050 --> 01:04:52.910
It looks like chewy from the comedy store.
You don't,

1102
01:04:52.940 --> 01:04:57.560
you guys don't remember chewy.
That is offensive at the same thing happened with,

1103
01:04:57.561 --> 01:05:00.950
um,
let me see that picture.
Look at that.
The Shit is ridiculous.

1104
01:05:01.390 --> 01:05:05.090
He was happening there.
These,
it looks like he runs a casino in upstate New York.

1105
01:05:05.120 --> 01:05:06.380
You ever hear him talk?

1106
01:05:06.740 --> 01:05:11.210
Can we play some of the need to hear it from Charles town?
It was very offensive.

1107
01:05:11.540 --> 01:05:16.320
Oh my God.
Let's listen to some Charlie's yet.

1108
01:05:16.450 --> 01:05:17.950
I'm,
I'm right now.

1109
01:05:18.150 --> 01:05:23.050
<v 2>Jimmy,
what do you think?
What year do you think this was?</v>

1110
01:05:23.290 --> 01:05:28.220
1945 it says,
it doesn't say fifties scarlet Johannson had that whole issue.

1111
01:05:28.221 --> 01:05:31.340
Remember she was cast in that movie and it was supposed to be an Asian role in

1112
01:05:31.341 --> 01:05:33.950
how,
and people went crazy over it.
Build,

1113
01:05:34.990 --> 01:05:38.050
let's hear some of this here.
He goes,
I can't.

1114
01:05:39.170 --> 01:05:42.110
<v 5>Alrighty,
you have telephone.
Wait a minute,
I got your telegram.</v>

1115
01:05:42.111 --> 01:05:43.520
I started watching all terrain.

1116
01:05:44.480 --> 01:05:49.220
You contact mysterious Mr Raj or pick him up then and she got off the train and

1117
01:05:49.221 --> 01:05:51.650
Hodge.
That's one of my man over there.
He and I have,

1118
01:05:51.750 --> 01:05:56.210
I owe him seven now around.
Just know you'll follow him.

1119
01:05:56.330 --> 01:05:59.630
He couldn't help it.
I think a jewelry we've kept

1120
01:06:00.870 --> 01:06:05.840
<v 2>look at his face.
He does be real look remotely.
They taped his eyes for sure.</v>

1121
01:06:05.930 --> 01:06:07.280
They did some weirdness,

1122
01:06:07.760 --> 01:06:12.560
but not much because he looks like every housewife in Bev hills minus the facial

1123
01:06:12.561 --> 01:06:16.820
hair,
the pullback phase where you're like,
take off 10 years,

1124
01:06:17.060 --> 01:06:21.590
but back then,
you know this guy could get away with that.
You know,
uh,

1125
01:06:22.460 --> 01:06:26.930
what's his face,
John Lady in the Saran wrap.
She's a ghost or some shit.

1126
01:06:26.990 --> 01:06:29.420
Dude.
What's happening to her?
That is bizarre.

1127
01:06:29.421 --> 01:06:34.370
Even know if that has to run around back then.
Shit,

1128
01:06:34.520 --> 01:06:37.190
I'll bubble
wrap up.

1129
01:06:37.191 --> 01:06:41.400
Food is just enough to just on it and take it home after the party balloon.

1130
01:06:42.190 --> 01:06:46.600
Put your food inside of it.
It's absolutely saver face.

1131
01:06:46.630 --> 01:06:50.760
What is that shit she's wearing?
Like a glass veil or something.

1132
01:06:50.800 --> 01:06:54.970
Shiela booth.
Is that Louis Gomez and Shiela booth?

1133
01:06:55.010 --> 01:06:57.230
They're time travelers.
And this is,
I mean,

1134
01:06:57.500 --> 01:07:00.410
isn't it great to live in this time where our movies are so much better,

1135
01:07:00.740 --> 01:07:02.570
but we're going to laugh in the future.

1136
01:07:02.570 --> 01:07:05.660
Looking back at how stupid things are today,
you just can't see a comment.

1137
01:07:05.690 --> 01:07:08.210
Number one,
you saw have the re look at that guy.
That's a cool chair.

1138
01:07:08.300 --> 01:07:11.520
What is that dude?
So another Chinese guy,
that dude,

1139
01:07:11.530 --> 01:07:15.020
it's not really a Chinese guy.
I think he's got some terrible face makeup,

1140
01:07:15.021 --> 01:07:19.130
I think added to them.
I think that looks like a,
like Joey Diaz on acid.

1141
01:07:19.760 --> 01:07:23.060
Look at that with a head wrap.
That's fancy tape.
It does look like.

1142
01:07:23.061 --> 01:07:27.740
Takes a regal Tate Tate on acid.

1143
01:07:27.980 --> 01:07:32.750
Yeah.
On acid.
Real angry.
Ruling a kingdom after a couple of divorces.
Yeah.

1144
01:07:32.751 --> 01:07:35.840
He's like an 80 year old tape.
Yeah,
that's a mental where,

1145
01:07:36.440 --> 01:07:40.130
well that's what they used to do.
But look,
look up John Wayne as Ganga is con.

1146
01:07:40.131 --> 01:07:42.920
That's even dumber cause they ain't even,
man didn't even change anything,

1147
01:07:43.070 --> 01:07:46.550
including the way Todd.
He talked like John Wayne,

1148
01:07:47.030 --> 01:07:50.900
we're gonna go out there or we're gonna fuck up these Russians.

1149
01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:53.680
He talked literally like John Wayne,

1150
01:07:53.770 --> 01:07:57.980
but he was dressed like a for fucking hat on.
It made me cry.

1151
01:07:58.670 --> 01:08:01.590
Oh my God,
that's so dumb.
Oh my God.
You have to see it.

1152
01:08:02.490 --> 01:08:06.380
How would they made that movie where they're like,
this is it.
This is it.

1153
01:08:07.330 --> 01:08:11.930
They didn't know everything sucked.
Everything did kind of suck for sure.

1154
01:08:11.931 --> 01:08:14.510
There's only a few like gone with the wind.
Like,
Whoa,
what did they do?

1155
01:08:14.511 --> 01:08:19.460
There was like a few movies,
rose citizen Kane like,
whoa.
You're like,

1156
01:08:19.461 --> 01:08:23.810
wow,
this one doesn't suck
it up,

1157
01:08:25.040 --> 01:08:28.520
gang guess God.
Amazing.

1158
01:08:29.930 --> 01:08:32.360
Wow.
Look at that beard.

1159
01:08:32.361 --> 01:08:35.900
He went from playing like a fucking sheriff and some wild west.

1160
01:08:35.930 --> 01:08:40.370
Wild West town to kingus Khan.
Hollywood was so whitewashed.

1161
01:08:40.760 --> 01:08:45.200
It really,
really was.
Well they knew back then.
If they did a John Wayne movie,

1162
01:08:45.201 --> 01:08:50.000
they would sell a million tickets.
You know?
That's really what the thing is,

1163
01:08:50.130 --> 01:08:54.600
an aspect of that still going on and go on and I sort of,

1164
01:08:54.830 --> 01:08:57.440
I don't know if you feel the same way.
I get it to a certain point,

1165
01:08:57.920 --> 01:09:00.830
like when you go out in the comedy clubs and there's like a youtube influencer

1166
01:09:00.831 --> 01:09:04.250
booked on a weekend,
you're just like,
oh fuck.
But then you're like,
well,

1167
01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:07.550
I kind of get it from a business standpoint.
If they're filling the rooms.

1168
01:09:07.551 --> 01:09:08.361
I did a Gig in,

1169
01:09:08.361 --> 01:09:12.890
in Arizona once and they had a daytime gig books from a youtube influencer.

1170
01:09:13.100 --> 01:09:18.100
They pack this place out at 11:00 AM with like 12 year old kids as fans named

1171
01:09:18.470 --> 01:09:21.800
Bert Kreischer.
Yes,
it was.
It was a Bert Kreischer day show.

1172
01:09:23.540 --> 01:09:26.840
He didn't take his whole shirt off.
It was a crop top or a halter.

1173
01:09:27.500 --> 01:09:29.540
Burke does those day shows.
He does.

1174
01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:33.350
He'll do radio and then we'll do a show at like noon for people that don't have

1175
01:09:33.351 --> 01:09:36.720
jobs.
It's like work call in sick to work or something like that.

1176
01:09:36.721 --> 01:09:39.440
You call it something like that.
Like that call in sick to work,

1177
01:09:40.280 --> 01:09:45.200
but he took his shirt.
So funny that ladies he's looking slim.

1178
01:09:45.560 --> 01:09:49.800
Yeah.
That is slim for Bert.
That's only like 19 months pregnant.
Yeah.

1179
01:09:49.830 --> 01:09:51.440
And that's a protrusion in his heart.

1180
01:09:51.480 --> 01:09:54.530
He enrolled in the valley bottom eight year old inside of him.

1181
01:09:54.710 --> 01:09:55.940
Them has to take his shirt.

1182
01:09:55.970 --> 01:10:00.590
He takes his shirt off in the or now every time I used to take a shirt off only

1183
01:10:00.591 --> 01:10:04.590
in the main room,
it's like whoa.
Or keep my shirt on now.
No,

1184
01:10:04.610 --> 01:10:06.290
he decided no more of that.

1185
01:10:06.320 --> 01:10:09.680
Does it come off all every show set right when he gets on stage,

1186
01:10:09.681 --> 01:10:12.260
it takes his shirt off.
When you decide when that happens,

1187
01:10:12.261 --> 01:10:15.650
I wonder like is there a moment that's how you do it?
Pre,

1188
01:10:15.710 --> 01:10:17.840
pre Mike grab or grabs the mic?
Well,

1189
01:10:19.270 --> 01:10:24.050
his body is a,
a source of pride.
He enjoys,

1190
01:10:24.051 --> 01:10:27.580
uh,
what the fruits of his labor and his,
um,

1191
01:10:28.040 --> 01:10:30.290
appetite for,
uh,
indulgence.

1192
01:10:30.440 --> 01:10:33.410
I don't know if it's a body as much as it is a building.
It's a body.

1193
01:10:34.250 --> 01:10:39.230
People know what's his body.
They know he's a party animal
and they go,
all right,

1194
01:10:39.231 --> 01:10:41.930
it's burnt fuck he is.
He's fun.

1195
01:10:41.931 --> 01:10:45.850
It is a lot of fun article that was written about that like talking about,
uh,

1196
01:10:46.010 --> 01:10:50.210
I was reading this,
this guy was like talking about how hilarious it was.

1197
01:10:50.670 --> 01:10:54.650
It's a party.
It definitely has.
I'm sorry.
He is an animal and sometimes you know,

1198
01:10:55.250 --> 01:10:57.400
there's this implicit where people are just kind of quiet on stage.

1199
01:10:57.830 --> 01:11:00.680
I laugh just by taking off my shirt.
I think I'd go for it.

1200
01:11:00.740 --> 01:11:03.950
Why not start off with it?
But now the problem is I think Burt owns it,

1201
01:11:03.980 --> 01:11:06.470
which is weird.
You know,
like he's like,

1202
01:11:06.471 --> 01:11:10.700
you think he should have some like a little bit of a feeling about it.
No luck.

1203
01:11:10.701 --> 01:11:14.220
He owns it.
Like,
uh,
if you wanted to go

1204
01:11:14.220 --> 01:11:16.670
<v 0>up and take your shirt off,
people go,
what do you copy?</v>

1205
01:11:18.170 --> 01:11:20.450
<v 3>That's a good point.
The only one doing it.</v>

1206
01:11:20.690 --> 01:11:23.120
He's the only comic disrobing every time.

1207
01:11:23.300 --> 01:11:27.290
But there's some weird ones like that Bobby,
Bobby Lee takes his pants off.

1208
01:11:27.291 --> 01:11:27.671
I mean,
I've,

1209
01:11:27.671 --> 01:11:31.970
I've seen that that weeny weeny a few times winking at me from the green rooms

1210
01:11:31.971 --> 01:11:36.290
of the comedies.
You should probably not tell people that first stop doing it.

1211
01:11:36.291 --> 01:11:40.610
People probably get mad now.
He can't,
he can't not do it.
They're like,

1212
01:11:40.611 --> 01:11:45.340
take off the shirt.
It was a jump on him on stage.
Tag Them.
Yeah.

1213
01:11:45.560 --> 01:11:48.470
Yeah.
But I mean there's,
there's a couple of dudes who go clove,

1214
01:11:48.530 --> 01:11:52.250
clove lists you take off their pants and their shirts,
but the,

1215
01:11:52.251 --> 01:11:55.730
but it's weird that that's Burt's thing.
Yeah,
it is weird.
You're right though.

1216
01:11:55.731 --> 01:11:58.100
If anybody else were to do it,
they would know that that was,
uh,
uh,

1217
01:11:58.101 --> 01:12:00.410
Bert situation.
There was another one like that,

1218
01:12:00.411 --> 01:12:02.710
that we were just talking about the other night at the comedy store.

1219
01:12:02.740 --> 01:12:05.960
Like how crazy does it someone like took over like a thing,

1220
01:12:07.150 --> 01:12:11.300
a standup comedian?
I think so.
It doesn't matter.
I'm not gonna remember.

1221
01:12:11.990 --> 01:12:14.010
I want to know what it is.
Well,
there's like a cut.

1222
01:12:14.750 --> 01:12:18.490
There's a comic in New York snaps.
You got like a snap every time they did it.

1223
01:12:18.500 --> 01:12:21.500
You know what?
Frazier Smith.
I love watching Frazier Smith when he's like,

1224
01:12:21.501 --> 01:12:26.120
come on people.
These are jokes and he likes,
yeah,
it's like a,

1225
01:12:26.160 --> 01:12:29.390
it's like a timekeeper.
I liked that,
right?
Yes.
In rhythm.
Yeah.

1226
01:12:29.391 --> 01:12:32.720
It keeps you in rhythm.
It's,
it's musical up there sometimes if it's going well,

1227
01:12:33.990 --> 01:12:37.310
but it goes well.
It's weird how people can become like a thing.

1228
01:12:37.311 --> 01:12:41.510
Like this is the guy who talks about food.
I know.
I was thinking about that.

1229
01:12:41.511 --> 01:12:45.800
Like how,
what,
what?
What comes first in that scenario,

1230
01:12:45.801 --> 01:12:49.040
does it naturally evolve or does it happen once and then the person builds

1231
01:12:49.041 --> 01:12:52.970
around it because it's a crutch.
Mm.
There's a,

1232
01:12:52.971 --> 01:12:56.970
there's a fine line between the art and the marketing.
Exactly.
Yeah,

1233
01:12:57.160 --> 01:13:00.710
and in who you know,
do your thing like it's a short life.

1234
01:13:00.740 --> 01:13:04.220
Why not find that little niche that works for you and fucking make that money

1235
01:13:04.221 --> 01:13:06.290
and have fun and bring some joy to people who gives a fuck?

1236
01:13:06.500 --> 01:13:09.950
I have a problem when people talk shit about people going after what they're

1237
01:13:09.951 --> 01:13:13.990
doing and finding a little trick to it.
Who cares what everybody,

1238
01:13:14.010 --> 01:13:17.450
everybody's doing.
People get angry if they get tricked God.
Yeah,
that's true.

1239
01:13:17.510 --> 01:13:20.790
That's true.
Fucking trick.
Yeah.
Can't believe this shit dude.

1240
01:13:23.660 --> 01:13:26.090
<v 0>I remember there was this lady who reviewed video games,</v>

1241
01:13:26.091 --> 01:13:29.450
she was like talking about video games and they found a video of her from years

1242
01:13:29.451 --> 01:13:33.340
earlier saying that shows the and play video games.
They're like,
ah,

1243
01:13:34.220 --> 01:13:35.053
ah,

1244
01:13:35.610 --> 01:13:40.520
even play video you're using is like evidence.

1245
01:13:40.521 --> 01:13:43.930
I was like,
this is,
this is,
this is during that whole gamergate thing,
Mike.

1246
01:13:43.931 --> 01:13:45.770
This is evidence that the world has gone mad.

1247
01:13:46.100 --> 01:13:49.670
People are arguing over whether or not someone is a real video game player.

1248
01:13:49.930 --> 01:13:52.400
You're not even a real player.
You fake play.

1249
01:13:52.450 --> 01:13:55.960
<v 3>We'll have too much time on their hands,
man.
Too much time.</v>

1250
01:13:55.961 --> 01:13:59.440
And they get stuck in that like stuck in that like web universe.

1251
01:13:59.570 --> 01:14:01.850
<v 0>Well,
not just that.
Like,
yeah,
people change.</v>

1252
01:14:02.150 --> 01:14:05.840
Like I wasn't playing video games just three months ago now.

1253
01:14:05.870 --> 01:14:08.770
Jamie and Jeff and I were playing him every fucking day.

1254
01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:12.490
We play this quick game.
Oh that's,
that's a video

1255
01:14:12.490 --> 01:14:17.140
<v 2>game.
Jamie fucked me up yesterday.
He beat his ass.
How did that feel?</v>

1256
01:14:17.410 --> 01:14:21.800
It doesn't feel good.
Yeah.
We have fun.
We have fun.
We talk a lot of shit.

1257
01:14:21.801 --> 01:14:25.660
I was just gonna say you probably talked a lot of shit after you lost.
No.

1258
01:14:25.720 --> 01:14:27.460
Did you cry a whole I did.
What he did.

1259
01:14:27.461 --> 01:14:30.550
Fuck me up on this one map that I was very angry at this map because it keep

1260
01:14:30.551 --> 01:14:33.750
falling off.
That's so whack.
You fall off and you sue us.

1261
01:14:34.240 --> 01:14:37.740
He did a much better job than maybe he owned me on the other evens out.

1262
01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:41.650
But even so even so I just to a certain degree when the invite,

1263
01:14:41.710 --> 01:14:43.590
I liked that one map.
Do we play on?

1264
01:14:43.591 --> 01:14:48.591
Cause when you do go out you do suicide but it's not that common.

1265
01:14:48.970 --> 01:14:52.990
That other one that was just like every time I get you and if you're jumping and

1266
01:14:52.991 --> 01:14:55.720
you don't look behind you,
you're like fuck.
Ah.

1267
01:14:55.721 --> 01:14:58.570
You Watch yourself fall explode when you hit the rock

1268
01:15:00.220 --> 01:15:03.500
explode.
How many times did it fall is some,

1269
01:15:03.520 --> 01:15:08.070
some are the range of 30 not joking.
You're really aren't going to know it.
No.

1270
01:15:08.190 --> 01:15:11.500
And here's me fallen.
Fuck goddammit.

1271
01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:15.800
Fuck this.
Map this map son of a bitch.

1272
01:15:15.850 --> 01:15:20.610
Shit suck.
Suck.
What the fuck.
And then,
uh,

1273
01:15:20.680 --> 01:15:24.730
Jeff's getting good to come problem Jeff.
Fuck me up yesterday too.

1274
01:15:25.130 --> 01:15:28.610
<v 3>I think it's good to have like,
I wish I was good at video games.
I'm not,</v>

1275
01:15:28.700 --> 01:15:32.240
I'm not that.
What do you wish,
why would you want that skill?

1276
01:15:32.270 --> 01:15:35.060
Because I think it's good like the hand eye coordination and just like,

1277
01:15:35.120 --> 01:15:39.110
I don't know,
being able to relax,
play game.
I'm going to find a fucking chinuch.

1278
01:15:39.170 --> 01:15:41.630
You want to be them drone pilots?
I guess I do.

1279
01:15:41.900 --> 01:15:46.520
So what do you think about Ufo owes 100% real?
100% real.
You ever see one?

1280
01:15:46.700 --> 01:15:50.930
Um,
I did actually see one really I did in New York City.

1281
01:15:50.931 --> 01:15:53.210
This was years ago.
I was walking downtown.

1282
01:15:53.211 --> 01:15:56.130
I used to bartend at this place called puppies tavern in Tribeca,

1283
01:15:56.370 --> 01:15:59.780
walking downtown.
Beautiful Sunny Day.
And as I'm crossing the street,

1284
01:15:59.840 --> 01:16:02.920
I'm just looking at everybody,
everyone's looking up like,
what are these people?

1285
01:16:02.940 --> 01:16:05.990
Can I look up?
And there's this like,
I don't know,

1286
01:16:06.170 --> 01:16:11.170
like a weird oval chrome thing in the sky pretty far,

1287
01:16:12.440 --> 01:16:16.130
far up.
But you could see what it was.
And I was,
I remember talking to the dude,

1288
01:16:16.131 --> 01:16:18.460
I'm like,
what is that?
And he was videotaping.
I was like,
I don't know,

1289
01:16:18.470 --> 01:16:20.540
we've all been standing here.
It hasn't really moved.

1290
01:16:20.750 --> 01:16:24.380
Just was kind of suspended in the air and not a lot of sound at all.

1291
01:16:24.680 --> 01:16:26.330
And I had to get to work.
I'm like,
all right,

1292
01:16:26.331 --> 01:16:29.030
well I got to go make Calwood cock suckers for investment bankers,

1293
01:16:29.031 --> 01:16:30.140
so let me know what happens.

1294
01:16:30.141 --> 01:16:33.260
And I went to the bar and it was on the news at the bar and it was just this

1295
01:16:33.261 --> 01:16:35.970
weird,
it looked like,
like that bullet,

1296
01:16:36.080 --> 01:16:40.430
that little bullet vibrator thing or like a little suppository in the sky.

1297
01:16:40.970 --> 01:16:44.900
It was like a like a,
like a balloon.
Yeah.
Like almost like a balloon,

1298
01:16:44.901 --> 01:16:49.310
but a little bit more elongated.
Very quiet.
It was bizarre blimp.

1299
01:16:49.790 --> 01:16:54.480
Nah,
not like it's sat upright.
It was almost like it.
This was oval shaped Cam.

1300
01:16:55.390 --> 01:16:59.330
Exactly right.
But Yup.
It was bizarre.

1301
01:16:59.840 --> 01:17:04.190
But that was like the only real time.
I was like,
what is that?

1302
01:17:04.410 --> 01:17:06.250
<v 2>Hi.
I've met,</v>

1303
01:17:06.251 --> 01:17:09.400
remember being a little kid thinking that I might've saw something that I might,

1304
01:17:09.401 --> 01:17:10.060
I just convinced

1305
01:17:10.060 --> 01:17:11.330
<v 0>myself to sales board.</v>

1306
01:17:12.100 --> 01:17:13.690
<v 3>And also as your memory recalls,</v>

1307
01:17:13.691 --> 01:17:17.170
you recreate 100% but what do you remember?

1308
01:17:17.520 --> 01:17:19.070
<v 0>Oh,
I don't remember anything really,
but,</v>

1309
01:17:19.110 --> 01:17:24.060
but it was going to say is I've watched this Bob Lasar and area 51 documentary.

1310
01:17:24.080 --> 01:17:27.270
Oh boy.
Holy Shit.
It's really interesting.

1311
01:17:27.750 --> 01:17:29.220
It's a lot more interesting than I thought.

1312
01:17:29.430 --> 01:17:33.090
I always like to like dismiss a lot of the UFO stuff cause the most like this is

1313
01:17:33.091 --> 01:17:37.350
nonsense is so silly.
But my friend Dave Foley,
who are,
uh,

1314
01:17:37.470 --> 01:17:40.980
I treasure and I value his opinion very highly.

1315
01:17:41.370 --> 01:17:45.240
He told me that he started getting obsessed with Ufos.
He said,
thanks to you,

1316
01:17:45.241 --> 01:17:48.100
I'm obsessed with you.
I'm like,
thanks to me.
I don't know

1317
01:17:48.370 --> 01:17:50.480
<v 3>system that you might have a lot of obsessions,
I'm sure.</v>

1318
01:17:50.590 --> 01:17:53.500
<v 0>No,
but he and I,
when we used to work together on news radio,</v>

1319
01:17:53.530 --> 01:17:57.520
I was deep in my obsession with Ufo.
I was convinced

1320
01:17:57.700 --> 01:18:00.730
<v 3>what kicked it off.
Just tearing people's stories.</v>

1321
01:18:00.731 --> 01:18:02.260
If you only had one experience as a kid,

1322
01:18:02.320 --> 01:18:04.090
I don't even think I really did have an experience.

1323
01:18:04.120 --> 01:18:06.030
I think I probably saw jet fly overhead and like,

1324
01:18:06.040 --> 01:18:08.680
I think that might be your fault that I talked myself into it.

1325
01:18:08.950 --> 01:18:11.410
I don't think we heard that you had an obsession not based off of your own

1326
01:18:11.411 --> 01:18:13.080
experiences.
That's bizarre.

1327
01:18:13.370 --> 01:18:17.710
<v 0>Yeah.
I've always been super,
super obsessed with space.
Yeah.</v>

1328
01:18:17.720 --> 01:18:22.720
I think I had a really good teacher in seventh grade science and I remember he

1329
01:18:23.511 --> 01:18:26.820
said,
if you really want to make your brain hurt,
just look up and,

1330
01:18:26.830 --> 01:18:31.830
and try to imagine something that has no end

1331
01:18:34.470 --> 01:18:37.340
verse has no end.
Just you can't,
you want to hurt your head.

1332
01:18:37.341 --> 01:18:40.340
Just look up at the sky and understand there's no end to this.

1333
01:18:40.410 --> 01:18:41.570
<v 3>It doesn't make any sense.</v>

1334
01:18:41.580 --> 01:18:44.520
Doesn't make any sense because everything else in life and existence has a

1335
01:18:44.521 --> 01:18:46.910
finality to it.
Every single thing.

1336
01:18:47.180 --> 01:18:51.680
<v 0>Yeah,
we think,
but this guy,
when he planted that shit in my head,</v>

1337
01:18:51.920 --> 01:18:55.340
I remember thinking,
wow,
I never even thought of that before.
Like,

1338
01:18:55.341 --> 01:18:58.160
I just looked at the stars and I'll be like,
oh,
there's a stars.
They look cool.

1339
01:18:58.400 --> 01:19:00.650
Oh there's the moon are low.
I want to go to the moon.

1340
01:19:00.790 --> 01:19:05.170
<v 3>No.
Yeah,
like a dumb kid.
You don't have the perspective of like the vastness.</v>

1341
01:19:05.370 --> 01:19:09.840
<v 0>Yeah.
But when I was 13,
this guy said that 13,
maybe 14.</v>

1342
01:19:10.080 --> 01:19:13.800
No,
12,
I guess 12.
Somewhere in that range.
Seventh or eighth grade.

1343
01:19:14.130 --> 01:19:17.280
You had just started at yeah,
I remember him saying that to me.

1344
01:19:17.281 --> 01:19:21.090
And then being obsessed with space after that obsessed.
Like one thing that,
uh,

1345
01:19:21.120 --> 01:19:25.260
that uh,
the teacher said and that was it immediately.
Like what?

1346
01:19:25.800 --> 01:19:29.980
Like that was one of the first cool things I ever heard at school.
You know,
a,

1347
01:19:30.090 --> 01:19:33.540
someone cool,
well,
he was a cool teacher.
He was a Vietnam vet.

1348
01:19:33.570 --> 01:19:36.540
There was a couple of these guys that were Vietnam vets that were super scary.

1349
01:19:37.050 --> 01:19:37.980
There were scary.

1350
01:19:38.090 --> 01:19:41.450
<v 3>It's good to have a teacher like that though.
So many like that whole thing,</v>

1351
01:19:41.451 --> 01:19:44.450
like our education system really fails a student.

1352
01:19:44.451 --> 01:19:47.990
Sometimes I have teachers who invoke curiosity out of children who actually care

1353
01:19:47.991 --> 01:19:51.410
and have a,
you know,
interesting curriculum that they bring to the table.

1354
01:19:51.650 --> 01:19:54.170
I only had a couple of teachers like that that I can really remember.
But

1355
01:19:54.520 --> 01:19:58.540
<v 0>yeah,
I think three the three teachers that are really remember that like wow,</v>

1356
01:19:58.541 --> 01:19:59.680
that lady was so nice.

1357
01:19:59.780 --> 01:20:03.580
<v 3>Out of your entire schooling.
Yeah,
same.
I had a really cool ms lot.</v>

1358
01:20:03.581 --> 01:20:07.560
One was my first grade teacher and she'd have us line up outside of her and she

1359
01:20:07.561 --> 01:20:09.690
always had a pop color shall we smelled good.

1360
01:20:09.691 --> 01:20:12.390
She always had a pop collar and when you'd walk in her classroom,

1361
01:20:12.391 --> 01:20:13.650
if you had a collar,
she'd pop it.

1362
01:20:13.770 --> 01:20:16.650
So everybody sat in class and the popped collar.

1363
01:20:18.910 --> 01:20:23.910
That's hilarious.
Just brought this like cool mentality.
Like it just,

1364
01:20:23.911 --> 01:20:25.980
we felt like we were our own little clan in there.

1365
01:20:26.010 --> 01:20:27.900
Like the missalette lot wind clan.
That's what it was like.

1366
01:20:28.110 --> 01:20:31.590
When did you know that you want it to be a comedian?
Early,
early on,

1367
01:20:31.591 --> 01:20:35.730
like eight years old.
I was young.
Yeah.
I was entertaining my sister.
No,
shut up.

1368
01:20:35.880 --> 01:20:38.730
But I didn't know that.
I could make a career out of it because where I grew up,

1369
01:20:38.731 --> 01:20:41.480
there wasn't those like outlets there.
You know,
what?

1370
01:20:41.481 --> 01:20:46.481
We didn't have like a theater or any sort of cultural exposure that I could,

1371
01:20:47.680 --> 01:20:51.060
you know,
adhere to and just be like,
okay,
cool.
I'm going to be no gay people.

1372
01:20:51.061 --> 01:20:53.850
That's exactly.
Thank you know gay people.
Well we did.

1373
01:20:53.851 --> 01:20:55.690
They were hiding because they didn't want to be murdered.

1374
01:20:58.550 --> 01:21:02.000
Lol.
Jk.
Um,

1375
01:21:02.550 --> 01:21:07.410
how old were you when you first went on stage?
19.
Yeah,
I was 19 years old.

1376
01:21:07.480 --> 01:21:09.360
That's all you had to wait until 21.

1377
01:21:09.361 --> 01:21:14.361
I didn't realize afterwards that you can get into a bar as a performer.

1378
01:21:14.731 --> 01:21:16.770
I know.
Make sure you don't drink.
Yeah.

1379
01:21:16.771 --> 01:21:19.710
There was this cool place called the Cantab Lounge,
which is a,
I mean,

1380
01:21:19.740 --> 01:21:23.350
you're Boston,
right?
You know,
you know about all about it.

1381
01:21:23.700 --> 01:21:27.510
Cambridge area had this bar called the cantab lounge downstairs.

1382
01:21:27.511 --> 01:21:30.930
There was this little performance space called the third rail and I used to do

1383
01:21:30.931 --> 01:21:33.240
Improv for like six months and then one of the dudes was like,

1384
01:21:33.241 --> 01:21:36.180
you should try standup.
You might,
you might like it.
And this was in Cambridge.

1385
01:21:36.181 --> 01:21:40.580
We're doing,
yeah.
That's where I started at stand up and in Boston.
This was an I,

1386
01:21:40.680 --> 01:21:44.460
I was 19 I'm 36 now.
I can't do that math.

1387
01:21:45.650 --> 01:21:48.750
You're the scientist.
I'm the doctor.
I don't have time to do math.

1388
01:21:48.751 --> 01:21:52.920
I have to write descriptions,
calculations about the size of the stethoscope.

1389
01:21:52.921 --> 01:21:54.030
I can't do the math.

1390
01:21:57.490 --> 01:21:59.880
1919 I don't know what year it was.

1391
01:22:00.450 --> 01:22:02.720
2022 years ago.

1392
01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:07.770
2006 holy for 23 years ago.
80 years ago.

1393
01:22:07.890 --> 01:22:10.570
Fuck you were bad at math.
Just like me.
Well,
it was whatever,

1394
01:22:11.830 --> 01:22:16.260
whatever it was.
So you're 36 now,

1395
01:22:17.910 --> 01:22:22.850
almost 20 years ago.
Almost 20 years.
And my dad was there.
Actually have on tape.

1396
01:22:23.340 --> 01:22:27.080
You have it on tape.
I do have the first time I ever did standup I did and I,

1397
01:22:27.400 --> 01:22:31.090
it fucked me up for months,
dude.
It fucked me up for months.

1398
01:22:34.070 --> 01:22:36.690
It was just everything you can imagine.

1399
01:22:36.691 --> 01:22:40.410
It was new was all the things,

1400
01:22:41.850 --> 01:22:43.620
all the little clumsy,

1401
01:22:43.920 --> 01:22:48.920
clumsy and fast and not rooted in like a narrative about my life.

1402
01:22:49.711 --> 01:22:53.040
It just was sort of a,
a reflection of what I saw.
Essentially,

1403
01:22:53.041 --> 01:22:56.520
you go up there and you imitate something until you have your own voice for the

1404
01:22:56.521 --> 01:23:00.390
most part.
Yeah,
for sure.
But I have it on tape and I'll never forget,

1405
01:23:00.860 --> 01:23:04.230
we even videotaped afterwards and my dad came out from Syracuse to watch it.

1406
01:23:04.530 --> 01:23:06.880
My Dad,
he's,
he's since passed in October,
but he came out,

1407
01:23:06.881 --> 01:23:09.160
he was there for my first standup show and he's like,
Babe,

1408
01:23:09.161 --> 01:23:12.970
you're going to be fine duty.
My Dad's not in the industry.
He doesn't know shit.

1409
01:23:13.390 --> 01:23:16.420
This dude was like,
you know,
he sold real estate and bartend.

1410
01:23:16.421 --> 01:23:19.000
Like he wasn't like in the entertainment industry,
but he's like,
Babe,

1411
01:23:19.001 --> 01:23:22.780
you're gonna be fine.
You're great because you got high energy.
He's like,

1412
01:23:22.781 --> 01:23:25.060
you're going to be fine because you're up there and you've got high energy.

1413
01:23:25.061 --> 01:23:28.810
That's what the people like.
And I was like,
okay,
dad.

1414
01:23:29.200 --> 01:23:33.500
So I just kind of always thought about that like aspect of it,
like just my,

1415
01:23:33.580 --> 01:23:38.260
my physicality and not feeling embarrassed by it,
you know?

1416
01:23:39.010 --> 01:23:43.330
Did you ever say to your dad,
hey,
what about Steven,
right.
Yeah.
You know,

1417
01:23:43.510 --> 01:23:45.720
he definitely,
he liked comedians like that.
My,

1418
01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.310
one of my dad's favorite comics was a Stan hope.

1419
01:23:48.370 --> 01:23:50.380
He loves Stan Hope I'll never forget.

1420
01:23:50.381 --> 01:23:53.710
I did a show with Stan hope and Syracuse actually in and,
well,

1421
01:23:53.720 --> 01:23:56.530
my dad was sitting next to me when we're watching Stan hope and he leaned over.

1422
01:23:56.531 --> 01:24:00.610
He was like,
man,
the mind on this guy.
It's like one of the brightest,

1423
01:24:01.090 --> 01:24:05.910
brightest people I've ever heard in my life.
Dads get out more.
He's,
well,
he's,

1424
01:24:05.911 --> 01:24:09.820
he's in a grave now.
He's only getting out with a ghost.

1425
01:24:10.300 --> 01:24:13.060
He's probably a drunk ghost at some girl's house right now because he can't
find,

1426
01:24:13.061 --> 01:24:16.940
mine was getting ready to film another special.
Yeah,
very excited to watch.
Yeah,

1427
01:24:16.941 --> 01:24:20.830
it's going to be great.
Stan was,
he's,
he's like the,
I don't know.

1428
01:24:20.831 --> 01:24:23.440
He's like the equalizer when it comes to what's going on in society.

1429
01:24:23.470 --> 01:24:25.180
It just has a way of being like,
boom,

1430
01:24:25.720 --> 01:24:28.480
this is what's going on with gun control and with people being offended by

1431
01:24:28.481 --> 01:24:33.260
terminology and words.
Here's why it's ridiculous.
Yeah.
He's good like that.
Well,

1432
01:24:33.310 --> 01:24:34.110
he

1433
01:24:34.110 --> 01:24:38.040
<v 2>works,
you know him.
He's a guy that he and he works on his own schedule.</v>

1434
01:24:38.070 --> 01:24:42.360
He decides when to write,
when to perform.
When the tour went to do the,

1435
01:24:42.361 --> 01:24:46.740
and he was always like,
ah,
I might just fucking retire.
And then right back at it.

1436
01:24:46.950 --> 01:24:50.250
New special coming out next year.
Yeah.
He's always,
he's always working.

1437
01:24:50.280 --> 01:24:53.910
He's always working.
He has his own glad he's out there.
Yeah,
he's,
he's amazing.

1438
01:24:53.911 --> 01:24:56.790
I love watching him.
Glad he's out there cause he's just like,

1439
01:24:56.820 --> 01:25:01.680
he's basically an older version of the guy.
He was like 20 plus years ago.

1440
01:25:02.160 --> 01:25:06.300
It's has not changed at all other than like become more wacky.
Yeah.

1441
01:25:06.680 --> 01:25:07.860
Well it's fucking goofy.

1442
01:25:07.861 --> 01:25:12.861
Suits the box and just fucking suits every time I seen him.

1443
01:25:13.320 --> 01:25:14.670
What the fuck.
But here's the thing,

1444
01:25:14.671 --> 01:25:18.930
like that's one of the things like he owns the no can wear the suit if you wear

1445
01:25:18.931 --> 01:25:22.060
a goofy suit,
like a really shitty suit.
Like Stan hope borders,

1446
01:25:23.370 --> 01:25:25.680
peach colored suit with ruffles.

1447
01:25:25.740 --> 01:25:30.400
He wears loafers like a old man from Caddyshack days.

1448
01:25:31.110 --> 01:25:35.170
He looks like he used to sell cars 20 years ago and it kept the outfit.
Yeah.

1449
01:25:35.330 --> 01:25:38.310
And I love it.
Frees your Smith's long lost cousin.

1450
01:25:38.610 --> 01:25:43.200
He looks up to the 12th Toledo was cousin from Toledo sells cars.

1451
01:25:43.530 --> 01:25:48.230
He looks like a ghost from the titanic.
He rents out clown shoes.

1452
01:25:48.500 --> 01:25:52.680
Rock star,
those shoes.
Yeah,
but you're right.
That's his,
that's his thing.
Yeah.

1453
01:25:52.681 --> 01:25:53.490
That's his look.

1454
01:25:53.490 --> 01:25:58.470
No one can do little suits and he's been rocking this look for quite a while

1455
01:25:58.471 --> 01:26:00.750
now.
Like he used to dress like a normal person.

1456
01:26:01.130 --> 01:26:04.310
<v 3>Semi.
I mean there was,
there was always a level</v>

1457
01:26:04.310 --> 01:26:05.570
<v 2>of uh,
of eccentric.</v>

1458
01:26:07.400 --> 01:26:10.040
His entire wardrobe for $40.

1459
01:26:11.540 --> 01:26:13.580
The luxury.
Yeah.

1460
01:26:13.581 --> 01:26:18.530
I mean you could get that jacket for $2 and it's amazing.
Then he finds a,

1461
01:26:18.531 --> 01:26:22.550
all that seemed to be tailored.
It's like a fraud.
He takes these gay,

1462
01:26:22.760 --> 01:26:26.120
he takes these shitty fabrics to like a real high end Taylor.

1463
01:26:26.570 --> 01:26:30.110
And he has him like slim fit.
It pretends he finds them.

1464
01:26:31.360 --> 01:26:34.910
We definitely get some nice tailored look at that shirt,
the bum jacket,

1465
01:26:35.200 --> 01:26:36.560
shirt and tie.
It's not bomb though.

1466
01:26:36.561 --> 01:26:38.210
It's all nice and cute and he's nice and clean.

1467
01:26:38.211 --> 01:26:40.790
But I'm seeing it looks like a bum that struck it rich real quick.

1468
01:26:41.250 --> 01:26:43.820
Like he got money fast and didn't know what to do so we just bought the same

1469
01:26:43.821 --> 01:26:44.900
suits but cleaner,

1470
01:26:45.350 --> 01:26:49.370
no for bomb struck at rich they'd be wearing like the finest things you saw on

1471
01:26:49.371 --> 01:26:49.890
the windows.

1472
01:26:49.890 --> 01:26:54.890
Those department stores are on the outside and was in a garbage bag.

1473
01:26:55.520 --> 01:26:58.230
Prada,
yeah.
Yeah.

1474
01:26:58.260 --> 01:27:00.890
Once you got on your feet and cleaned up and stuff,

1475
01:27:01.370 --> 01:27:03.980
couple of days to get used to the fact that you're rich now.

1476
01:27:04.160 --> 01:27:06.920
I don't know if I'd be able to.
I obviously I don't have a knack or fashion.

1477
01:27:06.921 --> 01:27:10.280
I'm in like a gangster hillbilly overall outfit,
but it works.

1478
01:27:10.370 --> 01:27:14.150
I don't know if I'd be able to like just know what to wear after being homeless

1479
01:27:14.151 --> 01:27:17.900
for so long.
First you got to kick the heroin and the piss stained shirt.

1480
01:27:18.130 --> 01:27:20.450
You got to kick all that.
You've got to clean your body up.

1481
01:27:20.480 --> 01:27:22.670
You got $100 billion in the bank now.
Claude,

1482
01:27:22.940 --> 01:27:25.880
what's I'm saying there's a little bit of a process,
you know,

1483
01:27:25.881 --> 01:27:30.020
you're not going from like shit stain shorts to Gucci Pants.
Well,

1484
01:27:30.021 --> 01:27:33.110
most people don't even make it,
you know,

1485
01:27:33.111 --> 01:27:36.350
like when when people win money in the lottery,

1486
01:27:37.150 --> 01:27:39.890
but they almost always spend it all or go crazy.

1487
01:27:40.910 --> 01:27:44.510
I don't think people get adjusted to that idea that all of a sudden boom.

1488
01:27:44.660 --> 01:27:48.350
So he just drops off a giant chunk of change.
Like if you got an inheritance,

1489
01:27:48.351 --> 01:27:50.930
money from grandpa gives you $1 million,

1490
01:27:50.931 --> 01:27:53.300
like you're going to burn through that shit.
Most people,

1491
01:27:53.301 --> 01:27:56.360
I don't even think it's reserved for homeless people.
I mean like rappers,

1492
01:27:56.361 --> 01:28:00.950
athletes,
comedians.
That's what goes back to our education system.

1493
01:28:00.951 --> 01:28:05.950
We're not taught financial responsibility in high school.
We should be,
listen,

1494
01:28:05.960 --> 01:28:08.510
it doesn't matter if you teach comedians financing,

1495
01:28:09.350 --> 01:28:11.990
most of us are not going to follow that.

1496
01:28:12.550 --> 01:28:17.540
Well clunky pulsive I wanted to just at least have something saved for the

1497
01:28:17.541 --> 01:28:20.750
future cause I knew that about myself that I did not know enough.

1498
01:28:20.751 --> 01:28:25.490
So I started to save some and do a little bit of googling for every Kevin Hart

1499
01:28:25.520 --> 01:28:29.630
who has like real knowledge about finances.
There's like four dudes like me.

1500
01:28:30.580 --> 01:28:35.110
No idea what's going on that's got like a custom Jim and 16 cars on the way.

1501
01:28:36.090 --> 01:28:38.570
I don't have any time for thinking.
But do you like that?

1502
01:28:38.571 --> 01:28:41.180
Like what you know as a woman,

1503
01:28:41.210 --> 01:28:44.280
you know our indulgences or like you know going to the spa or maybe it's

1504
01:28:44.281 --> 01:28:47.330
shopping,
like what's your thing like on a day off,

1505
01:28:47.331 --> 01:28:48.890
what do you do that brings you joy?

1506
01:28:48.891 --> 01:28:53.060
That is a is a commercial look material and material thing.

1507
01:28:53.900 --> 01:28:56.740
Obviously you like your cars and enjoy cars,
but I enjoy,

1508
01:28:57.170 --> 01:28:59.960
I'm a big fan of engineering.
Like I'm,
I'm,
I'm,

1509
01:29:00.020 --> 01:29:02.220
I love mechanical things like,

1510
01:29:02.400 --> 01:29:03.840
<v 0>like I think my favorite car,</v>

1511
01:29:03.841 --> 01:29:05.700
I have this car that doesn't have any power steering,

1512
01:29:05.860 --> 01:29:09.510
it doesn't have air conditioning and it's got an air cooled engine.

1513
01:29:09.960 --> 01:29:14.310
It's one of my favorite cars.
What is it?
1993 Porsche,

1514
01:29:14.400 --> 01:29:18.390
rs America.
It's a really light car.
Some really even that fast.

1515
01:29:19.170 --> 01:29:20.510
It's not fast.
Like a modern college.

1516
01:29:20.550 --> 01:29:22.380
It's definitely not fast compared to my Tesla.

1517
01:29:22.530 --> 01:29:27.530
Tesla is the craziest fucking car I've ever driven by far.

1518
01:29:28.080 --> 01:29:31.530
Every other car seems stupid.
What models seem dumb?

1519
01:29:31.560 --> 01:29:36.340
It's the model s just 100 wow.
Fucking postures.

1520
01:29:36.360 --> 01:29:37.340
How fast that car is

1521
01:29:37.420 --> 01:29:40.930
<v 2>and just the technology on it.
And does it also have auto?
Oh yeah.</v>

1522
01:29:40.950 --> 01:29:42.940
All the drives does everything.
How does that work?

1523
01:29:42.941 --> 01:29:45.130
Like if you're driving down the highway,
if you set up auto,

1524
01:29:45.131 --> 01:29:47.500
does it legitimately go to your destination?

1525
01:29:47.860 --> 01:29:52.660
<v 0>You have to hit this little thing to switch lanes to see that you want to switch</v>

1526
01:29:52.661 --> 01:29:57.310
lanes,
but it'll switch lanes for you.
It will drive with the speed of traffic.

1527
01:29:57.370 --> 01:30:01.090
So it'll slow down when traffic slows down,
speed up and traffic speeds up,

1528
01:30:01.390 --> 01:30:03.550
it turns,
it makes perfect term.

1529
01:30:03.730 --> 01:30:07.840
<v 2>Wow.
It's crazy.
So could you just be cause see that one out and let it go?</v>

1530
01:30:07.841 --> 01:30:11.800
You really shouldn't,
but I'm just as an argument,
you probably could.
Wow.

1531
01:30:11.830 --> 01:30:12.663
You hold your hand on

1532
01:30:12.730 --> 01:30:15.400
<v 0>steering wheel.
Like you're supposed to have light pressure on the steam wheel.</v>

1533
01:30:15.520 --> 01:30:20.520
Apparently some crazy fucks have a is that's what it looks like on the screen.

1534
01:30:20.590 --> 01:30:23.410
Wow.
They just updated it like last week.
Yeah.

1535
01:30:23.411 --> 01:30:26.410
The updated to recognize I'm stoplights.

1536
01:30:27.020 --> 01:30:31.730
<v 2>That is so,
I mean the future is now.
That is so wild.
Bananas,</v>

1537
01:30:31.820 --> 01:30:33.140
but someone told me,

1538
01:30:33.141 --> 01:30:35.540
I don't know if it's true and it's irresponsible for me to even say it,

1539
01:30:35.541 --> 01:30:38.600
but I'm going to say it,
do it.
This is your podcast you're looking at.

1540
01:30:38.610 --> 01:30:40.570
You're going to go crazy.
Someone said that

1541
01:30:40.640 --> 01:30:45.470
<v 0>you can bypass the touch sensors on the steering wheel that knows if you're</v>

1542
01:30:45.471 --> 01:30:47.180
holding onto the steering wheel with a tennis ball.

1543
01:30:47.480 --> 01:30:50.720
These shove a tennis ball in there,
and if you do that,
you can just go to sleep

1544
01:30:50.860 --> 01:30:54.720
<v 2>and the try it.
Well,
you know what?
Modern Darwinism.</v>

1545
01:30:54.760 --> 01:30:59.000
We'll take care of the rest.
I hope not.
I like

1546
01:31:00.830 --> 01:31:03.400
to die either,
but people do dumb things all the time,

1547
01:31:03.580 --> 01:31:06.970
but there's a difference between those kinds of cars and the cars that I really

1548
01:31:06.971 --> 01:31:11.830
liked.
I liked these mechanical cars.
They feel,
you feel the gears,

1549
01:31:11.831 --> 01:31:15.700
like,
see,
this guy's got a tennis ball.
He's got an orange.
Oh Shit in there.

1550
01:31:15.880 --> 01:31:16.870
He's got a little citrus.

1551
01:31:16.871 --> 01:31:20.890
The citrus works for driving as well as getting rid of bacteria.
Yeah,

1552
01:31:20.920 --> 01:31:25.350
he debunked Tesla's autopilot orange hack.
Oh,
he debunked it.
Oh,

1553
01:31:25.351 --> 01:31:27.190
it's to see if it worked or not.
I see.

1554
01:31:27.700 --> 01:31:29.710
It seems like it's working and it does look like it's working.
Okay,

1555
01:31:29.960 --> 01:31:31.720
so it might explain what you are you,

1556
01:31:31.721 --> 01:31:34.930
it makes you hold onto it like every now and then.

1557
01:31:34.960 --> 01:31:37.960
It doesn't make you hold onto it all the time as it should fail,
fail,

1558
01:31:37.990 --> 01:31:40.450
bunking failed.
It actually does work that way.
I mean,

1559
01:31:40.451 --> 01:31:43.630
how much is going on in your life that you can't?
I enjoy driving.

1560
01:31:44.140 --> 01:31:48.790
I enjoy the mechanism of it.
I enjoy where my mind goes.
I like blasting my music.

1561
01:31:49.600 --> 01:31:54.160
I may or may not hit a joint.
May or may not,
allegedly.
Probably not.

1562
01:31:54.161 --> 01:31:56.260
But you know,
I enjoy driving.

1563
01:31:57.290 --> 01:31:58.700
<v 0>Well,
I do too,</v>

1564
01:31:59.080 --> 01:32:02.500
but I think if there was a button that you could press,

1565
01:32:03.080 --> 01:32:05.800
let's say you drive in the car just drives.

1566
01:32:05.801 --> 01:32:07.510
You hit that button the all the fucking time.

1567
01:32:07.990 --> 01:32:10.480
Most of the time when you're in traffic,
you just don't want to deal you.
Just,

1568
01:32:11.170 --> 01:32:13.420
especially in La,
if I'm going to the airport,

1569
01:32:13.450 --> 01:32:17.710
I get up in the morning and I just hate that by
let's go bitch.

1570
01:32:19.240 --> 01:32:22.000
Barely pay attention all the way to the airport.

1571
01:32:22.810 --> 01:32:25.720
There's certain situations where it would be useful.
Definitely.

1572
01:32:25.890 --> 01:32:29.710
But when you're driving,
like say if you're driving in a canyon and you know,

1573
01:32:29.711 --> 01:32:34.570
like you're up these hills and driving around these like beautiful scenic

1574
01:32:34.571 --> 01:32:35.404
places,

1575
01:32:35.500 --> 01:32:39.220
you want to be driving like a little sports car with a manual transmission.

1576
01:32:43.160 --> 01:32:46.270
You want to feel it grabbing the wheel and hug in the corners.
Jamie,

1577
01:32:46.271 --> 01:32:50.920
there's a care person.
Feel like he,
he can add that to the Tesla.
No.
Why not?

1578
01:32:50.950 --> 01:32:53.590
What do you want to feel the gears?
You won't feel the grinding.

1579
01:32:53.620 --> 01:32:56.170
You won't feel the shifting of the,
oh,
the gear yourself.

1580
01:32:56.171 --> 01:32:59.230
It doesn't have any gears.
Like you're so many oral experiences.

1581
01:32:59.231 --> 01:33:01.660
You'd have to be lying to me about,
first of all,
here's one,

1582
01:33:01.810 --> 01:33:05.020
the revving of the engine,
like when you get up to red line,

1583
01:33:05.021 --> 01:33:06.230
when you're shifting gears,
right?

1584
01:33:08.940 --> 01:33:10.320
There's a sound that,
uh,

1585
01:33:10.590 --> 01:33:15.300
especially like a really well engineered German car has when they hit those high

1586
01:33:15.301 --> 01:33:17.560
revs,
it's uh,
just a,
uh,

1587
01:33:18.120 --> 01:33:22.020
it's a symphony of coordinated mechanics.

1588
01:33:22.740 --> 01:33:23.573
<v 6>Why?</v>

1589
01:33:25.650 --> 01:33:29.850
<v 0>And you're shifting and the youth really hit the fucking,</v>

1590
01:33:29.851 --> 01:33:32.460
you blip on the downshift.
Like on the downshift,

1591
01:33:32.461 --> 01:33:33.770
you do what's called heal towing.

1592
01:33:33.910 --> 01:33:37.980
Will you got one foot on the brake and you go like this tomorrow so that as

1593
01:33:37.981 --> 01:33:40.110
you're going from third to second,

1594
01:33:40.260 --> 01:33:44.580
you give it a little extra juice so that your engine rpm catches up with where

1595
01:33:44.581 --> 01:33:47.800
the gears going to be.
When you get into second gear,
it's gonna rev higher,

1596
01:33:47.801 --> 01:33:52.380
so wow,
and you're all d.
It's like a coordinated effort.

1597
01:33:52.381 --> 01:33:53.400
All these things are happening.

1598
01:33:53.580 --> 01:33:57.050
It's not just like sitting there like with an orange on your steering right now.

1599
01:33:57.460 --> 01:33:58.980
It's just something else going on.

1600
01:33:59.010 --> 01:34:03.990
I just came in my pants from that whole description of
what I'm saying.

1601
01:34:03.991 --> 01:34:08.790
If you made fart sounds no,
you can make,
here's the thing.

1602
01:34:08.791 --> 01:34:13.620
It doesn't matter if you make the sound.
I want to feel the shift.

1603
01:34:13.621 --> 01:34:16.860
They can push the no,
Jamie,
Jamie,

1604
01:34:16.861 --> 01:34:18.750
you're pushing your foot into the clutch.

1605
01:34:18.751 --> 01:34:22.980
You're putting the thing indicates it's a mechanical action.
You can't fake that.

1606
01:34:23.010 --> 01:34:27.240
Now you can't find that given Ilan Ilan can face is going to listen.

1607
01:34:27.420 --> 01:34:30.480
If he did,
it would be less good than what he has.

1608
01:34:30.540 --> 01:34:33.460
What he's got is better than any other car.
Right.

1609
01:34:33.540 --> 01:34:35.880
Cause this basic level of driving,
it's not,
you know,

1610
01:34:35.881 --> 01:34:37.980
you're not interactive with shifting and everything,

1611
01:34:37.981 --> 01:34:40.890
which is probably the fun of having a car where you can actually drive it

1612
01:34:40.891 --> 01:34:44.160
manually.
Well there's a feeling all a bunch of things.
First of all with his car,

1613
01:34:44.190 --> 01:34:49.020
they don't have any gears.
It's just one gear.
It doesn't shift.
It doesn't change.

1614
01:34:49.060 --> 01:34:49.893
That's bizarre.

1615
01:34:50.010 --> 01:34:53.940
It doesn't hit a red line and then you don't have to move to third gear or it

1616
01:34:53.941 --> 01:34:58.340
does it itself.
It just has one gear.
And then on top of that it has this giant

1617
01:34:58.400 --> 01:34:59.360
<v 2>navigation screen.</v>

1618
01:34:59.540 --> 01:35:02.570
I mean it's the crazy huge fucking thing you've ever seen in your life.

1619
01:35:02.571 --> 01:35:04.160
It's like 14 inches tall.
Right.

1620
01:35:04.580 --> 01:35:08.780
And then on top of that it's got like all these safety features.

1621
01:35:08.781 --> 01:35:12.200
It's looking at things and warning you about this and shows you where all the

1622
01:35:12.201 --> 01:35:16.060
cars around you as you're driving.
I was like having my mom in the front seat.

1623
01:35:16.080 --> 01:35:18.620
Sounds like just to get something over there.
It's something here.

1624
01:35:18.621 --> 01:35:20.840
Watch out for that hunt.
It's like,
all right,
shut up.

1625
01:35:20.841 --> 01:35:23.570
What if your mom was psychic in to just sending it to your brain?

1626
01:35:25.500 --> 01:35:27.600
Does not saying anything showing it.

1627
01:35:27.850 --> 01:35:29.600
It shows that it doesn't like say everything,

1628
01:35:29.601 --> 01:35:31.520
but doesn't it have like a fart machine in there?

1629
01:35:31.521 --> 01:35:34.850
I read that there's like a fart machine in the and the Teslas.
Oh boy.

1630
01:35:34.851 --> 01:35:37.960
You should read more.
I saw.
What was it?

1631
01:35:38.780 --> 01:35:42.320
It's a fart sound that it can make if you want it to.
Right.

1632
01:35:42.680 --> 01:35:44.460
So when people saw fart machine,
dude,

1633
01:35:44.461 --> 01:35:48.170
a fart machine would make actual farts can make it makes a fart noise though,

1634
01:35:48.171 --> 01:35:52.250
right?
Yes.
Essentially it's a fart machine.

1635
01:35:52.251 --> 01:35:56.930
Just not like a sound effect.
Mechanics deal machine.
There's no machine,

1636
01:35:56.931 --> 01:35:59.550
but there's like the,
yes.
That's great.

1637
01:35:59.740 --> 01:36:03.760
And that's enough for me to get the Tesla kinds of farts.
Yeah,

1638
01:36:03.850 --> 01:36:08.570
you can have like wet forest,
short little tiny farts.
Hookworm farts.

1639
01:36:10.590 --> 01:36:15.140
What do you think of hookworm smell like rotten fish.
It carcass.

1640
01:36:15.200 --> 01:36:19.940
Some dead worms inside your body.
Like a river soaked carcass.

1641
01:36:20.120 --> 01:36:22.670
Have you ever seen an animal?
I know you have a lot of dogs.

1642
01:36:22.940 --> 01:36:27.590
Do you ever seen an animal shit out?
Worms.
I know and I definitely don't want to,

1643
01:36:27.591 --> 01:36:30.380
but now the images just vivid in my mind.

1644
01:36:31.070 --> 01:36:35.240
Many times I'll look worms coming out of there,

1645
01:36:35.241 --> 01:36:38.910
but like you look in there but you see like a little worms.
Yeah,

1646
01:36:39.730 --> 01:36:41.630
you've ever seen that it's super common.

1647
01:36:42.150 --> 01:36:44.780
Crazy that it happened was they have had so many dogs in my life.

1648
01:36:44.800 --> 01:36:46.250
That's what does that mean?

1649
01:36:46.251 --> 01:36:49.460
That they're like not normal dogs that I haven't had them crap out worms.

1650
01:36:49.520 --> 01:36:51.500
Well they probably didn't get dewormed.
You know,

1651
01:36:51.501 --> 01:36:55.040
they didn't get their price rescue dogs before.
You know,

1652
01:36:55.250 --> 01:36:58.790
the deworming stuff takes place.
And when I was a kid,

1653
01:36:58.910 --> 01:37:01.820
our dog had it and I remember watching like little worms come out of her,

1654
01:37:01.821 --> 01:37:06.440
but I was like,
where is it?
Little white worms with wigs.
And I was like,

1655
01:37:06.441 --> 01:37:10.700
what in the fuck is this?
It's nature's weird man.

1656
01:37:11.830 --> 01:37:15.440
Oh yeah,
there's an organism feeding on an organism.
That's all.

1657
01:37:15.441 --> 01:37:17.870
This is just organisms feeding on each other.

1658
01:37:18.070 --> 01:37:21.620
It's one big fuck fest for the organisms or we're leach fest.

1659
01:37:23.110 --> 01:37:27.770
These things.
I think the fuck.
Do you think those parasitic worms?
Fuck no,

1660
01:37:27.771 --> 01:37:30.470
they just probably separately.
They'd probably just,
you know,

1661
01:37:30.510 --> 01:37:33.350
they just divide themselves.
There's no sex happening.
They're like,

1662
01:37:33.351 --> 01:37:34.490
it's going to be going a fuck.

1663
01:37:34.520 --> 01:37:37.790
Did you see that python that they found in the middle of the everglades?

1664
01:37:37.791 --> 01:37:42.500
It was 17 feet long.
My,
I was so I googled it.
I saw,

1665
01:37:42.501 --> 01:37:47.060
this is one of the things I was talking about,
exotic pets.
I googled it.

1666
01:37:47.210 --> 01:37:50.780
They get to 30 feet long.
I can't.
Something to understand that.

1667
01:37:50.840 --> 01:37:52.130
That is ridiculous.

1668
01:37:52.131 --> 01:37:56.550
And so then I went down a whole whole direct records,

1669
01:37:56.570 --> 01:38:01.140
17 foot long python carrying 73 eggs captured in Florida's everglades.

1670
01:38:01.170 --> 01:38:03.060
Another reason we should just get rid of Florida,

1671
01:38:03.061 --> 01:38:04.980
snap it off and push it into the ocean.

1672
01:38:04.981 --> 01:38:08.370
There's too much craziness happening there.
Fucking snake.

1673
01:38:08.400 --> 01:38:10.050
Now here's the thing that freaked me out.

1674
01:38:10.051 --> 01:38:12.180
A found of those snakes get twice that length.

1675
01:38:12.960 --> 01:38:17.960
So this has only been going on apparently for like the last 15 or so years.

1676
01:38:18.840 --> 01:38:23.840
They apparently didn't have a real population of pythons in the everglades 15

1677
01:38:23.881 --> 01:38:27.650
years ago,
but somebodies pet get loose.
That thing had 73 eggs.
Oh No.

1678
01:38:27.660 --> 01:38:30.870
It didn't get loose.
Some asshole just released his snake.

1679
01:38:31.380 --> 01:38:34.450
Someone just chucked it out the window and then it fucks up the balance of the

1680
01:38:34.470 --> 01:38:35.303
angle.

1681
01:38:35.310 --> 01:38:40.240
They escape from a breeding facility destroyed by Hurricane Andrew in 1992 that

1682
01:38:40.250 --> 01:38:42.920
makes sense.
100% Oh,
horror movie starts

1683
01:38:44.790 --> 01:38:46.950
horror movie.
Somebody write that script.

1684
01:38:46.951 --> 01:38:49.950
Tens of thousands of Burmese pythons are estimated now.

1685
01:38:49.951 --> 01:38:53.940
We live in the area and that's just now they've completely wiped out all the

1686
01:38:53.941 --> 01:38:58.500
raccoons,
all the skunks,
all the rabbits.
It was almost,
no.
Yeah,

1687
01:38:58.501 --> 01:39:01.560
they're eating alligators now.
Nice.
Those things.

1688
01:39:01.561 --> 01:39:04.620
Eat alligators video to see the dude.

1689
01:39:06.300 --> 01:39:10.470
There's a photograph of one that died because the alligator chewed its way out

1690
01:39:10.471 --> 01:39:11.430
of its body.

1691
01:39:12.330 --> 01:39:17.330
Nature is so God damn ruthless.

1692
01:39:17.560 --> 01:39:19.480
There's some beauty in that ruthlessness,

1693
01:39:19.900 --> 01:39:24.900
just that like underlying desire for survival and that exists in creatures like

1694
01:39:25.621 --> 01:39:28.230
that,
that can't,
there's no empathy.
There's no sympathy.

1695
01:39:28.231 --> 01:39:30.930
They're just going to eat their way out of you to survive.
Yeah.

1696
01:39:30.940 --> 01:39:33.690
There's something cool about as long as it's not your five year old kid that

1697
01:39:33.691 --> 01:39:38.670
gets snatched up.
Absolutely.
That's a God damn nightmare.
This show this,

1698
01:39:38.680 --> 01:39:42.890
but let's just for you guys,
so it was just one doing this.
Look,

1699
01:39:43.090 --> 01:39:46.190
that is a different one.
I think this is a,

1700
01:39:46.191 --> 01:39:51.191
an Anaconda and a Cayman says python eats alligator alive,

1701
01:39:53.160 --> 01:39:57.840
the whole thing alive.
Is that a python?
For sure.
Yeah,
it seems like it is.

1702
01:39:57.900 --> 01:39:58.591
It seems like it is.

1703
01:39:58.591 --> 01:40:01.940
That's actually a video of me eating a grilled cheese and 2:00 AM looking at

1704
01:40:01.941 --> 01:40:06.180
home.
It is sped up a look how it gets all the way down to the fucking tail.

1705
01:40:06.181 --> 01:40:07.140
That is amazing.

1706
01:40:07.350 --> 01:40:11.430
If snakes have taste buds or if it's just for pure hunger to just stop and think

1707
01:40:11.431 --> 01:40:12.900
about what we're looking at here.

1708
01:40:12.901 --> 01:40:17.470
This snake just ate a whole alligator tail.

1709
01:40:17.730 --> 01:40:22.190
Oh Man.
It's body and it's just going to break it down.
Look at that evil

1710
01:40:23.780 --> 01:40:27.250
because they're vulnerable when they eat that he's got to go and just hide it.

1711
01:40:28.290 --> 01:40:32.370
Hide under a canopy.
Well,
that's why there's like snakes everywhere on earth.

1712
01:40:32.640 --> 01:40:34.320
Well now there are in Florida.
Yeah,

1713
01:40:34.321 --> 01:40:36.240
but I mean they're not everywhere because if they,

1714
01:40:36.760 --> 01:40:40.530
if they're really could just eat and then go out and eat again like real quick.

1715
01:40:40.531 --> 01:40:42.490
Like I'll look how align could it would be,

1716
01:40:42.750 --> 01:40:44.880
they would eat it on the ecosystem would be destroyed.

1717
01:40:44.940 --> 01:40:47.910
That's the one thing where the alligator chewed its way out

1718
01:40:50.360 --> 01:40:54.000
of that alligator.
It looks like the tail popped out and even

1719
01:40:54.070 --> 01:40:55.830
<v 3>see what's going on.
Maybe the tail,
you know,</v>

1720
01:40:55.831 --> 01:40:59.550
cause those tails are very strong and they're so thick.
It's like an armor

1721
01:40:59.690 --> 01:41:03.320
<v 0>go to that website.
That's wild man.</v>

1722
01:41:05.900 --> 01:41:07.880
Jesus Christ is really wild.

1723
01:41:07.910 --> 01:41:10.580
But that's just shows you how hungry these fucking things are.

1724
01:41:10.610 --> 01:41:12.260
They've eaten everything that's out there

1725
01:41:12.400 --> 01:41:13.990
<v 3>but also their masters,
their,</v>

1726
01:41:14.070 --> 01:41:18.100
their ability to capture something and then kill it.

1727
01:41:18.101 --> 01:41:22.870
That's that vicious brought an alligator like those are kind of hard to sneak up

1728
01:41:22.871 --> 01:41:26.680
on and capture and hold on to.
I don't think they are.

1729
01:41:27.700 --> 01:41:30.460
<v 0>No,
I think that's one of the reasons why it could get it so quick.</v>

1730
01:41:30.461 --> 01:41:32.350
I think they just lay around most of the time.

1731
01:41:32.900 --> 01:41:35.950
I think alligators don't tweak because they don't have any natural

1732
01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:39.420
<v 3>and it runs until the pythons came along.
I don't think there's really bad ass.</v>

1733
01:41:39.610 --> 01:41:41.820
Oh yeah.
I don't think they're equipped for this.
Yeah,

1734
01:41:41.821 --> 01:41:42.780
they're probably not equipped for,

1735
01:41:42.781 --> 01:41:44.320
you're probably right where they're just there.

1736
01:41:44.500 --> 01:41:47.040
The snake found a vulnerability in the system.
He was like,

1737
01:41:47.190 --> 01:41:48.360
I'm going to snack on alligators.

1738
01:41:48.690 --> 01:41:53.210
<v 0>How long it takes a snake with his nasty gut juices to break down alligator
hide.</v>

1739
01:41:53.260 --> 01:41:56.740
<v 3>Three,
three,
three days.
Three to four days.
That's my guess.</v>

1740
01:41:57.550 --> 01:42:00.850
I'm gonna say at least a week to break down all of that.
Maybe even longer.

1741
01:42:01.040 --> 01:42:01.873
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1742
01:42:02.710 --> 01:42:04.660
<v 3>It's got to have some gnarly like</v>

1743
01:42:06.220 --> 01:42:10.030
acids in its stomach to break that down.
Some Shit like from the movie alien,

1744
01:42:10.880 --> 01:42:13.780
like battery acid.
It just burns right through it.

1745
01:42:13.800 --> 01:42:18.800
So why aren't we like using snake acid to break down rust on cars and stuff?

1746
01:42:19.841 --> 01:42:23.410
We should be looking into that.
It would clean up,
clean up everything.

1747
01:42:23.690 --> 01:42:27.890
<v 0>An animated recreation of the python alligator battle suggest that the python</v>

1748
01:42:27.891 --> 01:42:30.200
might have survived.
It's a massive meal,

1749
01:42:30.350 --> 01:42:34.940
but that a second gator came to the rescue and bid off the snake's head.
Oh,

1750
01:42:35.080 --> 01:42:36.430
<v 3>was that the alligators bitch?</v>

1751
01:42:36.860 --> 01:42:39.130
<v 0>No,
the force of the tussle,</v>

1752
01:42:39.190 --> 01:42:43.150
the new theory says is what caused the python ghost.
Whoa.

1753
01:42:43.270 --> 01:42:46.270
So alligator came and fucked him up after he ate an alligator.

1754
01:42:46.630 --> 01:42:51.070
He came and rescued.
They have any homeys no assholes.

1755
01:42:51.400 --> 01:42:54.850
I think they're assholes with tiny little brains and they just chew things and

1756
01:42:54.851 --> 01:42:57.850
suck them down.
Fuck reptilian style.

1757
01:42:57.880 --> 01:43:02.880
Did you ever see that video of the crocodiles and they go to feed them and uh,

1758
01:43:02.980 --> 01:43:05.920
it was on my Instagram.
Jamie,
the one with the crocodile.

1759
01:43:06.210 --> 01:43:10.430
This lady goes to throw some chicken out for the crocodiles and the crocodile

1760
01:43:10.431 --> 01:43:14.140
snap up the chicken and one crocodile reaches over to the guy next to him and

1761
01:43:14.141 --> 01:43:18.970
bites his leg,
bites the crocodiles like and it just rolls,
snaps it off,

1762
01:43:19.360 --> 01:43:23.110
checks it down,
swallows it.
And the other alligator,
the other crocodile rather,

1763
01:43:23.111 --> 01:43:26.950
it doesn't even budge.
He just got his arm bid off.
He's like,
what happened?

1764
01:43:27.010 --> 01:43:29.950
Oh my fuck.
This is when you realize what these things are.

1765
01:43:30.040 --> 01:43:33.460
They don't give a fuck there.
It's so crazy to watch.

1766
01:43:34.450 --> 01:43:38.600
Doesn't even freak out that its arm got bitten off and swallowed by it.

1767
01:43:38.910 --> 01:43:41.740
<v 3>I will say if I'm eating really delicious sandwich and someone bites me,</v>

1768
01:43:41.741 --> 01:43:44.500
I'm gonna be like,
I'm just going to finish the sandwich.
I have to be honest.

1769
01:43:44.501 --> 01:43:46.450
How hungry are you if you're very hungry?

1770
01:43:46.860 --> 01:43:47.990
<v 0>Well,
he's not even been finishing.</v>

1771
01:43:48.030 --> 01:43:52.340
He's lying there and the other allergy or these other crocodile bites

1772
01:43:52.340 --> 01:43:56.930
<v 2>his leg and then rips it off.
Watch this shit.
Just watch it.</v>

1773
01:43:57.710 --> 01:43:59.600
Boom.
Now Wash,
they run in.

1774
01:44:00.080 --> 01:44:04.760
See this one's snacking up and grabs it and the watch gator roll death.

1775
01:44:04.880 --> 01:44:08.160
Snaps it off,
chucks it down.
Go.

1776
01:44:09.740 --> 01:44:12.590
But look at him.
He doesn't even do anything.
Well what the fuck bro?

1777
01:44:13.430 --> 01:44:16.040
He just lost his leg and he's like,
what the fuck bro?

1778
01:44:16.240 --> 01:44:19.840
I mean those are not regenerative,
right?
Yes they are.
Can he grow another pot?

1779
01:44:19.930 --> 01:44:24.200
Yup.
Whoa.
Yeah,
they,
they grow other pots all the time.

1780
01:44:25.480 --> 01:44:30.470
That is so wild.
When it's insane or DNA,
my face.

1781
01:44:30.800 --> 01:44:33.950
I bet you that's really good for just like keeping your shit fresh or you look

1782
01:44:33.951 --> 01:44:37.460
like scales.
You want that.
That'd be kind of cool.
Forever scales.

1783
01:44:37.520 --> 01:44:39.710
That'd be a superhero I could probably capitalize on it.

1784
01:44:39.890 --> 01:44:41.650
Not even have to worry about what you look like.
Right.

1785
01:44:41.680 --> 01:44:45.680
Just scales to your face to there.
Right now,
I'm not going to wear any rouge.

1786
01:44:45.681 --> 01:44:49.310
I got scales.
I'm a go out.
Some girl had to be the first girl.
Get a face tattoo.

1787
01:44:50.360 --> 01:44:52.520
You can be the first girl.
He get scales.
Probably some.

1788
01:44:52.700 --> 01:44:56.580
Probably really long time ago somebody just got a face tattoo.
Well most likely,

1789
01:44:57.200 --> 01:45:01.220
most likely try tribal.
Maybe like one of those polyandrous tribes.

1790
01:45:01.310 --> 01:45:02.590
What does this Jamie,
so what?

1791
01:45:02.700 --> 01:45:04.610
It looks like a snake with the alligator inside of it.

1792
01:45:05.420 --> 01:45:06.950
It does take three days for it to break down.

1793
01:45:07.460 --> 01:45:12.110
[inaudible] scientist assignments to your lane at her.
Watch out.

1794
01:45:12.111 --> 01:45:15.470
I'm a doctor and a scientist and you know all about gut acids.

1795
01:45:15.860 --> 01:45:18.550
I know about gut acids cause I'm Italian.
I've got Agita.

1796
01:45:20.210 --> 01:45:22.220
God just didn't forever.

1797
01:45:25.280 --> 01:45:29.070
That's the silliest science.
He's got the fucking ige.

1798
01:45:30.220 --> 01:45:35.090
Know what's crazy about the everglades is if this is how it is now,

1799
01:45:35.120 --> 01:45:38.130
imagine what it's going to be like 20 years from now when these things just keep

1800
01:45:38.131 --> 01:45:41.570
breeding.
It's going to take a few generations for that to balance back out.

1801
01:45:41.571 --> 01:45:44.660
They need to put some walls in that area and get it all back to where it should

1802
01:45:44.661 --> 01:45:46.910
be.
Well,
they have crocodiles in there now too.

1803
01:45:46.970 --> 01:45:50.770
There's been confirmed sightings of Nile crocodiles,
not American crocodiles.

1804
01:45:50.840 --> 01:45:54.680
Nile crocodiles for the same reason.
That's wild.
Yeah.
The alligators are,

1805
01:45:55.040 --> 01:45:58.560
that's fucked.
It's fucked because those are the ones that eat zebras and shit.

1806
01:45:59.030 --> 01:46:02.300
Everything they're going to be eating,
watch,
hide.
Your kids hide your wife.

1807
01:46:02.470 --> 01:46:06.620
They don't definitely,
they'd be raping everybody.
Remember that guy?

1808
01:46:07.270 --> 01:46:09.440
He,
this is what I'm saying.

1809
01:46:09.441 --> 01:46:12.290
He found a lane and he capitalized off of that little moment.

1810
01:46:12.320 --> 01:46:13.340
He did for a little bit.
Yeah,

1811
01:46:13.400 --> 01:46:17.530
for a hot minute and now we know who he is by just saying a phrase.
I met him.

1812
01:46:18.460 --> 01:46:22.030
I met him at a,
one of the UFC is,
oh,
that's wild.
How was he?
A gentleman.

1813
01:46:22.220 --> 01:46:26.090
Very nice guy who's super confused about his life,
like fuck is going on here.

1814
01:46:26.210 --> 01:46:27.950
Why am I here?
Everybody knows me.

1815
01:46:28.220 --> 01:46:32.570
Like you went from being just a regular guy talking about break ins.

1816
01:46:32.730 --> 01:46:36.760
He was on the news interview to do it on the news and he was so funny that he

1817
01:46:36.770 --> 01:46:40.820
came back a viral star and then next thing you know like Dana white flew him out

1818
01:46:40.821 --> 01:46:45.680
to the UFC.
We were hanging out with him backstage is like,
what is this life?

1819
01:46:45.890 --> 01:46:49.950
Wow,
how about that?
Like cash me outside girl.
She is a,

1820
01:46:50.580 --> 01:46:51.930
she's a,
she's a rapper.

1821
01:46:51.990 --> 01:46:55.900
She's got like 20 million followers on Instagram and she's wrapping giant

1822
01:46:55.950 --> 01:47:00.950
billboard on sunset buildings where they have the whole thing about body but bad

1823
01:47:02.161 --> 01:47:03.900
baby bed bed.

1824
01:47:04.020 --> 01:47:08.490
Bit bitty bitty IBEW payments.
But you know,

1825
01:47:08.790 --> 01:47:12.360
sometimes when I work out I put female rapper station on Spotify and she pops
up,

1826
01:47:12.361 --> 01:47:16.080
look at his hair now,
live in your truth and love it.
Hold on a second.

1827
01:47:16.140 --> 01:47:17.970
Formerly gay.
Yup.

1828
01:47:18.060 --> 01:47:23.060
Antwan Dodson announces his baby boy's birth after expressing this desire to get

1829
01:47:23.791 --> 01:47:28.710
married.
That was a confusing headline,
but live it.
Do it.
He formerly get,
well,

1830
01:47:28.770 --> 01:47:32.680
you know,
he looks great there.
You should be open to change people who should be,

1831
01:47:32.860 --> 01:47:37.860
uh,
do you think that someone can be gay and then they could switch over?

1832
01:47:38.220 --> 01:47:41.700
Absolutely.
And they stopped being gay and they start being attracted to women.

1833
01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:46.050
Absolutely.
Why not?
We're,
we're on a dot suspended and nothing that's expanding.

1834
01:47:46.570 --> 01:47:49.770
Why not?
Why not?
That's so stunning to think,
right?

1835
01:47:49.771 --> 01:47:54.480
Like what is that possible?
Because I think what you just said,
people exist.

1836
01:47:54.480 --> 01:47:58.950
Some people exist in these comfortable bubbles and they have their routines and

1837
01:47:58.980 --> 01:48:02.190
they fear change because of the exhaustion,
because of what it takes.

1838
01:48:02.191 --> 01:48:04.770
And then when they hear somebody else live in a life that's outside of their

1839
01:48:04.771 --> 01:48:06.450
little bubble regimen,

1840
01:48:06.480 --> 01:48:10.050
they freak out because maybe it reflects their own inability to change

1841
01:48:10.051 --> 01:48:14.190
themselves or their fear of changing.
So I think a lot of that where people like,

1842
01:48:14.220 --> 01:48:14.431
you know,

1843
01:48:14.431 --> 01:48:17.900
look at someone like Antwan Dotson who was in a wig and where's glip gloss?

1844
01:48:17.901 --> 01:48:21.390
Or like,
what's that?
First of all,
you don't know that's a wig.
That's hurtful.

1845
01:48:22.890 --> 01:48:27.060
Did I trigger you Harrison Harris?
Beyonce.

1846
01:48:27.980 --> 01:48:31.500
It's really,
I think the same thing when I wake up.
It's real too,
by the way.

1847
01:48:31.501 --> 01:48:35.880
That's a real woman.
Okay.
Respect.
Better.
Watch out.

1848
01:48:35.881 --> 01:48:36.750
Those hips will snap.

1849
01:48:36.790 --> 01:48:41.040
You can turn on people that way by bringing something up that they didn't even

1850
01:48:41.041 --> 01:48:44.910
say and then saying,
don't ever fucking say anything about her,
but I didn't.

1851
01:48:44.940 --> 01:48:47.430
You're like,
what are you talking about?
All of a sudden you're on the defensive.

1852
01:48:47.790 --> 01:48:52.170
Be careful of people like that though.
I know what you're going to say next.

1853
01:48:52.320 --> 01:48:54.930
You're going to say yes,
that's mental illness.

1854
01:48:54.931 --> 01:48:57.690
You're going to say the Donald Trump is a strong leader.
What times?

1855
01:48:57.830 --> 01:48:59.520
I'm going to say that you're like,
wait a minute.

1856
01:48:59.560 --> 01:49:01.200
You got to say that we need border security.
I know.

1857
01:49:01.201 --> 01:49:06.110
What the fuck do a racist like,
no,
no,
no.
I have a conversation here.
I mean,

1858
01:49:06.120 --> 01:49:08.220
we need some border security.
Don't we blocked off.

1859
01:49:11.720 --> 01:49:15.500
We'll go down that wormhole with crazies.
Did you ever see what the board,

1860
01:49:15.501 --> 01:49:17.520
it looks like in Canada,
the middle of the forest,

1861
01:49:17.550 --> 01:49:21.660
I would imagine like Maple Syrup fountains of it's paved.

1862
01:49:21.661 --> 01:49:24.060
It's like not paved.
It's,
um,
it's like trimmed.

1863
01:49:24.061 --> 01:49:27.990
All the trees are trimmed and wide.

1864
01:49:28.260 --> 01:49:31.160
There's like a path that's a hundred yards wide.

1865
01:49:31.161 --> 01:49:34.920
That was like the border between us.
Like say if this table was like baron,

1866
01:49:35.080 --> 01:49:37.110
there's forest on this side of the force on that side.

1867
01:49:37.260 --> 01:49:40.940
That's what the path is like the entire length of the,

1868
01:49:40.941 --> 01:49:43.500
the connection between the United States and Canada.

1869
01:49:45.110 --> 01:49:48.190
That's trippy also.
Did you just call me?
No,

1870
01:49:48.190 --> 01:49:52.810
<v 3>I didn't.
I said it's barren.
I was like true.
Probably.</v>

1871
01:49:52.960 --> 01:49:55.660
That's wild.
Have you seen it in person?
No.
No,
no.

1872
01:49:55.840 --> 01:49:58.240
I just found out about two weeks ago.
That's really cool.

1873
01:49:58.600 --> 01:50:03.250
Crocodiles apparently can't regrow their limbs.
Oh,
that's a bummer.
Are you sure?

1874
01:50:03.340 --> 01:50:07.570
I just looked it up.
Even their tails.
Other amphibians,
Canva,

1875
01:50:07.571 --> 01:50:09.040
crocodiles and alligators can't,

1876
01:50:09.460 --> 01:50:11.920
I guess they're not going to live without a limb or two,
it says,

1877
01:50:11.921 --> 01:50:14.080
but they can't regrow tens of bomber.

1878
01:50:14.950 --> 01:50:17.150
You would think they would because you would think like genetically there's

1879
01:50:17.160 --> 01:50:20.020
similar like salamanders.
Couple of websites.
I mean I'm not,

1880
01:50:20.140 --> 01:50:24.400
I'm not the scientist here.
We know you aren't because he's sitting right here.

1881
01:50:24.401 --> 01:50:27.320
I'm not assigned to see that.
There can't be too soon to have something though.

1882
01:50:27.321 --> 01:50:32.200
It sounds good.
You're a doctor of comedy.
There's only that true.
Wow.

1883
01:50:32.650 --> 01:50:37.240
That just looks like a a power line path down to out.
It looks like cocaine.

1884
01:50:37.510 --> 01:50:40.600
It doesn't like a big line.
No,

1885
01:50:41.650 --> 01:50:45.580
no touchy zone.
I have the no touching zone.
Two zone right there.
That's my,

1886
01:50:45.581 --> 01:50:46.540
it's all my zones.

1887
01:50:46.640 --> 01:50:49.880
<v 0>Isn't that crazy?
That's the border between the beautiful.
That's beautiful.</v>

1888
01:50:49.881 --> 01:50:53.850
If you go up there and that is God's country,
that is spectacular.

1889
01:50:53.910 --> 01:50:57.050
I would love to blaze a blunt and walk that whole fucking thing.

1890
01:50:57.090 --> 01:50:57.950
It will freak you out.

1891
01:50:58.220 --> 01:51:01.730
Do you ever go a hiking deep in where you've got no cell phone reception and you

1892
01:51:01.731 --> 01:51:02.410
get to,

1893
01:51:02.410 --> 01:51:06.680
<v 3>I not like where it's that deciduous,
but like in,
you know like Jude deciduous,</v>

1894
01:51:06.681 --> 01:51:09.430
second big Joe Rogan.

1895
01:51:11.430 --> 01:51:15.980
I am somewhat well read.
I'm a fucking doctor.
Oh,
I forgot you were a doctor.

1896
01:51:16.010 --> 01:51:18.110
You have a doctor.
I was like to be a doctor of something.

1897
01:51:18.680 --> 01:51:23.200
What do I feel you're a doctor of?
I feel you're a doctor of comedy for sure.

1898
01:51:23.210 --> 01:51:26.500
We'll have it though.
There's no,
there's no,
I know there's no mastery.
We,

1899
01:51:26.510 --> 01:51:29.090
you and I've talked about this before and you know,
I said something like,

1900
01:51:29.091 --> 01:51:31.190
I don't know,
you were like,
how's comedy?
I'm like,

1901
01:51:31.191 --> 01:51:33.980
I'm just trying to figure it out.
You're like,
none of us ever will.
I,

1902
01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:36.230
I'm not saying that like you're the end of it,

1903
01:51:36.231 --> 01:51:40.140
but I think I was watching you on stage at the comedy store in,

1904
01:51:40.141 --> 01:51:43.400
in Hinchcliffe was next to me.
And um,
you know,

1905
01:51:43.401 --> 01:51:44.990
you're doing your set Killen and having a,

1906
01:51:45.050 --> 01:51:49.670
having a great show and this woman yells out in the middle of a joke and you

1907
01:51:49.671 --> 01:51:53.570
just kept fucking going.
You are so disciplined.
You didn't miss a beat.

1908
01:51:53.600 --> 01:51:57.650
You didn't acknowledge her.
You didn't give her any sort of energy or attention.

1909
01:51:57.920 --> 01:52:02.720
You just were so like in your joke.
And I just looked at Tony and he was like,

1910
01:52:02.721 --> 01:52:06.760
I know everybody else would have went to her a VA,
you know,

1911
01:52:06.770 --> 01:52:10.550
totally just like abandoned their joke and messed up the flow.
But you just,

1912
01:52:11.390 --> 01:52:12.710
in that day I was like,
damn,
I need to,

1913
01:52:12.860 --> 01:52:16.790
I need to stick to my jokes more than like indulging people who are yelling at

1914
01:52:16.791 --> 01:52:17.624
me from the office.

1915
01:52:17.950 --> 01:52:22.360
<v 0>Sometimes you have to indulge it and sometimes they are also going to ruin it</v>

1916
01:52:22.361 --> 01:52:23.260
for the people around them.

1917
01:52:23.261 --> 01:52:26.220
That's the number one thing to like when people go you,

1918
01:52:26.410 --> 01:52:30.090
you just can't fucking hang.
Like people have said that to like Chris Leah.

1919
01:52:30.100 --> 01:52:33.610
There was this lady called him.
What did she say?
She goes,
you're a planner,

1920
01:52:33.640 --> 01:52:37.810
not a comedian.
A real community and can deal with someone yelling something out.

1921
01:52:38.080 --> 01:52:38.990
Okay.
Chris told her,

1922
01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:41.800
shut the fuck up and get out of there and they kicked her out and that was her

1923
01:52:41.801 --> 01:52:45.200
thing that you're a planner.
And so now that I'll text Chris deleo nowhere.

1924
01:52:45.201 --> 01:52:46.190
You're a fucking plan.

1925
01:52:46.190 --> 01:52:51.080
<v 2>Or Bro,
he such a planner.
Comedians are the most unorganized people ever.</v>

1926
01:52:51.081 --> 01:52:54.980
If anything,
they're the worst planner.
Sometimes you have to address them.

1927
01:52:55.010 --> 01:52:55.843
Sometimes you do.

1928
01:52:55.910 --> 01:52:59.270
<v 0>The real problem is that there they're fucking it up for the people around them.</v>

1929
01:52:59.271 --> 01:53:01.610
They think they're just,
they're interacting with you.

1930
01:53:01.850 --> 01:53:06.140
But did not take any consideration the fact that even if you don't like what

1931
01:53:06.141 --> 01:53:06.890
someone's saying,

1932
01:53:06.890 --> 01:53:11.890
let them say it because there's 300 other fucking people in the room and you,

1933
01:53:11.921 --> 01:53:14.690
you don't get to the side.
You don't have to program director.
Right.

1934
01:53:14.691 --> 01:53:17.540
You don't get to decide what you like or don't like it just because you're in

1935
01:53:17.541 --> 01:53:19.040
front of that person.
You yell something out.

1936
01:53:19.400 --> 01:53:22.970
If the whole audience is sitting there watching the performance and the guys

1937
01:53:22.971 --> 01:53:27.430
working his way through some material there,
or the woman,
by the way,
sorry.
Um,

1938
01:53:27.830 --> 01:53:29.840
let them fucking finished their shit,
man.

1939
01:53:29.890 --> 01:53:34.720
<v 2>Do you find you have which gender yells out more or is it equal?</v>

1940
01:53:35.020 --> 01:53:39.970
Oh,
it's equal.
It's just dumb.
Equal men to women.
Most women.
Really?

1941
01:53:40.030 --> 01:53:43.660
Yeah.
I'd say for me it's been like 95% women

1942
01:53:44.920 --> 01:53:46.120
<v 0>probably say</v>

1943
01:53:48.580 --> 01:53:50.020
maybe there's a little bit of a,

1944
01:53:50.050 --> 01:53:55.000
an advanced and a little bit of a numbered difference in favor of men doing it.

1945
01:53:55.210 --> 01:53:59.050
<v 2>Obviously you probably have a more male dominated audience than I would.
Yeah.</v>

1946
01:53:59.051 --> 01:54:01.570
But guys bring their girlfriends and girlfriends like fuck him.

1947
01:54:02.600 --> 01:54:06.520
Listening to them,
always listening to him.
He's a fucking idiot asshole.

1948
01:54:06.540 --> 01:54:10.570
Do you really believe what he's saying and enough people just listen.

1949
01:54:10.600 --> 01:54:14.050
You can get confused and think you know what the fuck you're talking about.

1950
01:54:14.110 --> 01:54:16.570
That's what he is.
That's exactly what he is.

1951
01:54:16.600 --> 01:54:19.840
Just cause a lot of people are listening to him doesn't mean he knows what the

1952
01:54:19.841 --> 01:54:23.620
fuck he's talking about and you worship him like,
oh my God,
do you love him?

1953
01:54:23.770 --> 01:54:26.180
Are you in a bromance?
Is that what's going on?

1954
01:54:26.210 --> 01:54:27.840
You should be embarrassed of your side.

1955
01:54:27.910 --> 01:54:32.260
I don't give a fuck with Joe Rogan real man bringing that up.

1956
01:54:32.290 --> 01:54:35.680
God isn't even,
he's disgusting.
He's very angry.

1957
01:54:36.130 --> 01:54:37.980
He looks like a man ape ill

1958
01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:45.000
also the appeal is that you look like a Manny.
Well I get it gals.

1959
01:54:45.100 --> 01:54:47.230
I don't want to listen to fucking Taylor swift songs either

1960
01:54:49.300 --> 01:54:53.910
tear on my car and she's like,
Hey,
it is going to hate you.
Rock out to Taylor.

1961
01:54:53.930 --> 01:54:56.710
A few songs that are not bad.
You've got daughters in your house.

1962
01:54:56.711 --> 01:55:00.250
I know you dance to a Taylor swift.
I probably have if I've been hammered.

1963
01:55:01.090 --> 01:55:03.830
The thing is it's like it's not my thing.
It's not like

1964
01:55:03.930 --> 01:55:08.320
<v 0>what I would listen to all the time.
Like it's not my go to,
you know,</v>

1965
01:55:08.321 --> 01:55:11.590
and people have different go,
tos doesn't make it right or wrong,

1966
01:55:11.591 --> 01:55:14.920
but if you get dragged into someone else's Goto,
he got a grant and Barrett,

1967
01:55:14.950 --> 01:55:16.540
you ever,
anybody ever take you to a musical?

1968
01:55:17.310 --> 01:55:21.480
<v 2>Jesus fucking Christmas.
It's,
it's a,
it's a thing.
I went to one musical,</v>

1969
01:55:21.481 --> 01:55:23.940
I went to like three musicals.
One of them I only went to,

1970
01:55:23.941 --> 01:55:27.870
cause Stamos was in it due to do is tell everybody.

1971
01:55:28.320 --> 01:55:33.320
Jessie may might have a bit of a stock issue with giant Dockery.

1972
01:55:35.100 --> 01:55:38.550
I am not.
Stalking is a very nice man.
He reached out to me when my father passed.

1973
01:55:38.551 --> 01:55:41.470
He was very nice to me.
He sent a message.
He was very,
very nice.
Well,

1974
01:55:41.471 --> 01:55:43.950
but all joking aside,
you do

1975
01:55:43.980 --> 01:55:48.980
<v 3>have about a hundred photoshops of you with John Stamos in various positions in</v>

1976
01:55:50.071 --> 01:55:54.140
bed on a plane together,
on vacation together.
I'm sorry Katelyn,

1977
01:55:54.141 --> 01:55:58.770
who um,
my fans make,
you know,
they super impose me.

1978
01:55:58.771 --> 01:56:01.380
I find a photo of his,
it's funny and I'm like,
put me in this.

1979
01:56:02.160 --> 01:56:04.680
There's white horse,
he posted a picture of him on bed,

1980
01:56:04.710 --> 01:56:07.770
like from like the full house era.
I was like,
somebody put me on the bed

1981
01:56:09.980 --> 01:56:13.230
and then I apologize to Katelyn.
I always apologize to his wife and child.

1982
01:56:13.290 --> 01:56:15.110
I mean for the most part I try to joke,

1983
01:56:15.111 --> 01:56:18.540
but it's a long running joke that you've been doing for years now.

1984
01:56:18.550 --> 01:56:22.890
Are you kidding me?
Like I loved him as a kid and I,
I told this story before,

1985
01:56:22.891 --> 01:56:24.090
but I have a,

1986
01:56:24.120 --> 01:56:28.170
I had a poster of him above my bed as a kid that I literally kissed so much.

1987
01:56:28.171 --> 01:56:29.580
I wore a hole in his mouth.

1988
01:56:29.980 --> 01:56:30.813
<v 7>Oh,</v>

1989
01:56:32.080 --> 01:56:33.160
<v 3>through Joe Rogan.</v>

1990
01:56:33.790 --> 01:56:34.623
<v 7>Oh,</v>

1991
01:56:37.930 --> 01:56:42.680
<v 3>did you ate through the paper reading the tongue.
We are looking at</v>

1992
01:56:44.260 --> 01:56:48.920
doing all of the things.
Okay.
All of the things.
Yeah.
But I,
I went to a musical,

1993
01:56:48.921 --> 01:56:51.380
he was in bye bye birdie.
Very delightful.
Very talented man.

1994
01:56:51.410 --> 01:56:53.180
And then I went to a couple others,
but they are,

1995
01:56:53.540 --> 01:56:56.570
I fell asleep and the other ones,
they're ruthless.
They're,

1996
01:56:56.571 --> 01:56:59.510
it's in the intermission.
Kills me.
It's like,
why don't we just get it done?

1997
01:56:59.900 --> 01:57:01.550
Let's just go straight through.
Yeah.

1998
01:57:01.610 --> 01:57:04.960
I think I would've liked to see the book of Mormon that's like,
oh yeah.
You know,

1999
01:57:05.010 --> 01:57:08.090
that's,
that's a,
that's the exception.
I saw that.
It's awesome.
Yeah,

2000
01:57:08.091 --> 01:57:11.150
I would imagine they're geniuses.
Those guys are geniuses.
Yeah.

2001
01:57:11.600 --> 01:57:15.230
It's just really well read to a really well written rather.
It's really funny.

2002
01:57:15.650 --> 01:57:19.790
It's a really good story in there.
They obviously did their homework,

2003
01:57:20.060 --> 01:57:24.650
but I saw cats once when I was on a date.
I was Pawlak 19 fuck that.
Fuck.

2004
01:57:24.651 --> 01:57:27.110
Cats in general who are scary in real life.

2005
01:57:27.111 --> 01:57:30.140
Why you want to go see him sing and they're standing upright.
That's a nightmare.

2006
01:57:30.170 --> 01:57:34.250
You're a dog person,
not a cat person.
I would like a hairless cat.
Oh,

2007
01:57:34.251 --> 01:57:37.370
like a spanx.
I think they're cool.
The Shit in a box in your house.
Perfect.

2008
01:57:37.371 --> 01:57:41.290
So do I piss in your house?
I'm going to change my toilet to be Roman.
Fuck you.

2009
01:57:41.291 --> 01:57:43.640
I'm going to shit in about a bucket.
Yeah,
they shit in a box.

2010
01:57:43.641 --> 01:57:46.950
But that's a great thing to grow.
Sometimes my dog's crap on the carpet if there,

2011
01:57:47.030 --> 01:57:50.120
you know,
irritable.
The cats are weird,
man.
Cats.

2012
01:57:50.121 --> 01:57:52.700
I don't know if you can trust a cat.
Did you try some cats?

2013
01:57:52.730 --> 01:57:56.900
You have a couple cats,
don't you?
Yeah.
You got a fucking zoo.
I'm so jealous.

2014
01:57:57.470 --> 01:57:59.630
I want to come over and just put everything in your house.
Who am I?

2015
01:57:59.631 --> 01:58:04.280
Dogs died recently.
Oh,
I'm sorry.
I guess it was probably almost a year now.

2016
01:58:04.670 --> 01:58:08.060
It was Marshall said,
uh,
he didn't understand what was going on.

2017
01:58:08.180 --> 01:58:11.980
He looks like he's just pure joy and happy all the time.
He's the happiest dog.

2018
01:58:12.210 --> 01:58:15.800
He's so,
he brings me joy.
I just started following him on his true.
He's so happy.

2019
01:58:15.801 --> 01:58:19.760
Follow your dog on Instagram.
He's my buddy.
He's,
he's,
it's so weird.

2020
01:58:20.200 --> 01:58:24.230
Like you can see you guys have a straight bond.
Let's see.
So affectionate.

2021
01:58:24.290 --> 01:58:27.700
Do you run them off leash in the morning when you go?
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
No tickets.

2022
01:58:27.701 --> 01:58:31.640
You know,
he's been,
um,
he's got tick medication that he's taking,

2023
01:58:31.930 --> 01:58:35.210
but we have caught him with a couple of ticks home without all that luxurious

2024
01:58:35.211 --> 01:58:39.270
hair.
Those ticks are Pi like woo is struck,
match.
He,

2025
01:58:39.470 --> 01:58:42.010
he loves it though.
He never seen anything in is

2026
01:58:42.010 --> 01:58:46.210
<v 0>pure joy as that dog is like riding through the canyons.
He just loves it.</v>

2027
01:58:46.211 --> 01:58:48.730
He's so happy.
So how do you keep him so clean?
I mean,

2028
01:58:48.731 --> 01:58:50.950
I know you've got that like Joe Rogan experience money,

2029
01:58:50.951 --> 01:58:53.310
but he is luxurious cold water

2030
01:58:54.930 --> 01:58:59.010
and I've seen these mangled piece.
They really don't.

2031
01:58:59.020 --> 01:59:03.310
And they wonder why they lash out.
Marshall's not like for cats.

2032
01:59:03.311 --> 01:59:07.780
When you die castle start eating your face and like 16 hours dogs wait about a

2033
01:59:07.780 --> 01:59:10.390
week.
Yeah,
they probably don't even wait that long.
Dog stay about a week.

2034
01:59:11.230 --> 01:59:13.210
They love you a little bit more.
They won't eat you right away.

2035
01:59:13.840 --> 01:59:15.640
I don't even know if Marshall would eat you.
I think he would wait.

2036
01:59:15.740 --> 01:59:17.950
Wouldn't even know what you were.
Probably wouldn't understand it.

2037
01:59:18.070 --> 01:59:22.120
He would just keep throwing balls at you.
Just rolling them over to you whine.

2038
01:59:23.210 --> 01:59:28.180
He woke me up yesterday.
It was fucking really annoying.
Just decides to get up.

2039
01:59:29.390 --> 01:59:33.790
I got home from the comedy store,
I'd like to,
and then I watched some goofy,

2040
01:59:33.791 --> 01:59:38.020
I've been on this Ufo documentary kick watching you a foe.
Documentaries.

2041
01:59:38.500 --> 01:59:42.280
I told you it was David started talking about it.
We were talking about that.

2042
01:59:42.281 --> 01:59:42.671
What were you,

2043
01:59:42.671 --> 01:59:45.760
did you have something specific that you had saw a recently the documentary,

2044
01:59:45.820 --> 01:59:50.820
one of them was air area 51 Bob Lasar and Lef area 51 and flying saucers.

2045
01:59:52.550 --> 01:59:53.383
Some,

2046
01:59:53.660 --> 01:59:58.660
a documentary on this guy who claimed that he worked on these alien ships in

2047
01:59:59.111 --> 02:00:03.960
area 51 in the 1980s as time's gone on,

2048
02:00:04.180 --> 02:00:07.120
more of the things that he said if proven to actually be true,

2049
02:00:08.170 --> 02:00:12.190
including an element that he talked about.
Element one 15,

2050
02:00:12.191 --> 02:00:14.740
I think it was called like an organism from outer space.
No,
no,
no.

2051
02:00:14.741 --> 02:00:18.890
An element like a man created element,
you know,
at this carbon will,

2052
02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:23.650
there's an element that they created that he talked about way before it was ever

2053
02:00:23.651 --> 02:00:27.760
publicized and he talked about this thing and then it turned out to be true.

2054
02:00:27.910 --> 02:00:31.240
He talked about these,
um,
there's these,
um,
uh,

2055
02:00:31.360 --> 02:00:36.160
hand monitors that you would put your hand on this thing and these lines,

2056
02:00:36.161 --> 02:00:41.161
these metal lines would detect the distances in the bones of your fingers,

2057
02:00:41.830 --> 02:00:43.870
the exact distances and everyone is different.

2058
02:00:43.871 --> 02:00:47.800
It's like a signature thing and that they could find out if it was you or not

2059
02:00:47.801 --> 02:00:49.240
you,
it was trying to go through.

2060
02:00:49.241 --> 02:00:53.400
So the way they would scan people that bioscan would literally measure the bones

2061
02:00:53.401 --> 02:00:55.150
in their fingers and people said that was horse shit.

2062
02:00:55.430 --> 02:00:59.110
He talked about this in the 1980s people said it was horseshit but then later on

2063
02:00:59.150 --> 02:01:03.340
turned out no,
they did have that.
And Los Alamos,
they did have that in,

2064
02:01:03.341 --> 02:01:07.990
in area 51 and that this technology was very,

2065
02:01:08.020 --> 02:01:12.880
very uh,
advance,
very,
not just at very advanced but very not,

2066
02:01:13.260 --> 02:01:15.610
it was not well known at all.
Like very few people did.

2067
02:01:15.610 --> 02:01:17.290
And this guy who was creative of this documentary,

2068
02:01:17.291 --> 02:01:20.680
it was very difficult for them to get photos of this hand scanner.

2069
02:01:20.800 --> 02:01:25.660
But this hand scanner did exist and existed exactly as this guy described it in

2070
02:01:25.661 --> 02:01:28.030
the 80s I mean that's super progressive for that time.

2071
02:01:28.031 --> 02:01:32.410
It was also that did approve is top secret clearance to get to this place.

2072
02:01:32.411 --> 02:01:34.060
They know that he actually worked there.

2073
02:01:34.330 --> 02:01:39.330
There's people that worked in the same Los Alamos lab with him.

2074
02:01:40.040 --> 02:01:42.560
They tried to say he never worked there,
but his name's on the manifest.

2075
02:01:42.770 --> 02:01:43.521
It's very strange.

2076
02:01:43.521 --> 02:01:47.930
It's like they've tried to erase parts of this guy's passed because he um,

2077
02:01:47.990 --> 02:01:50.990
he filmed a bunch of their crafts as they were flying around.

2078
02:01:51.020 --> 02:01:54.290
Like he knew what days.
This is the thing,
that thing right there,

2079
02:01:54.291 --> 02:01:58.280
you put your hand on that and it actually measures the distance of the size and

2080
02:01:58.281 --> 02:01:59.260
length of your bone.

2081
02:01:59.320 --> 02:02:03.300
<v 3>That's,
that looks like something that's inside of an escape room in La.</v>

2082
02:02:07.560 --> 02:02:11.490
<v 0>I went into this documentary,
skeptical.
Yeah,
what I am,</v>

2083
02:02:11.491 --> 02:02:15.930
I'm so done with all those things but listen to this guy talk for awhile.

2084
02:02:15.960 --> 02:02:18.690
After awhile I was like,
what if he's telling the truth?

2085
02:02:19.170 --> 02:02:22.100
Like what if he is actually telling the truth because if he's actually telling

2086
02:02:22.120 --> 02:02:22.920
the truth,

2087
02:02:22.920 --> 02:02:27.920
there is some part of the government that had access at least in the 1980s to

2088
02:02:29.131 --> 02:02:30.330
alien technology.

2089
02:02:30.630 --> 02:02:33.600
<v 3>I mean it is,
it probably is some truth to that.</v>

2090
02:02:33.601 --> 02:02:36.810
Crazier things have happened and also like just your mentality of believing him.

2091
02:02:37.020 --> 02:02:40.770
It's probably the same thing that made Dr Malakai Lovejoy Robinson,

2092
02:02:40.771 --> 02:02:45.690
the third become successful con artist.
Yeah.
I mean either this dude,

2093
02:02:45.720 --> 02:02:47.640
there's validity of what he's saying in this documentary,

2094
02:02:47.641 --> 02:02:51.080
which I can't wait to watch or he's just really great at painting a picture.

2095
02:02:51.180 --> 02:02:56.130
Some people are so good at convincing you that's true of truths.
True.

2096
02:02:56.260 --> 02:03:00.630
There's people with like borderline personality disorder in every sort of

2097
02:03:00.720 --> 02:03:03.540
spectrum in between there they become really good manipulators.

2098
02:03:03.670 --> 02:03:08.260
<v 0>That is true.
However,
usually they do that in more than one avenue.</v>

2099
02:03:08.350 --> 02:03:11.890
Absolutely.
And this guy's not doing that.
Yeah.
So it's just a documentary.

2100
02:03:11.891 --> 02:03:13.840
Then also hasn't varied a story.

2101
02:03:14.570 --> 02:03:18.910
I mean he might have like changed the way he says things in terms of the words

2102
02:03:18.911 --> 02:03:19.744
he chooses,

2103
02:03:19.900 --> 02:03:23.710
but the actual story is exactly the same as he was telling a long time ago.

2104
02:03:23.770 --> 02:03:26.440
<v 3>Is this a self produced documentary or is there a production company?</v>

2105
02:03:26.740 --> 02:03:28.450
Production company.
That's where it's like,
okay,

2106
02:03:28.451 --> 02:03:29.650
there's probably some validity to this.
Yes.

2107
02:03:29.710 --> 02:03:31.180
<v 0>This guy's been around for a long time.</v>

2108
02:03:31.181 --> 02:03:34.990
I remember reading about him and watch videos about him,
you know,
20 years ago.

2109
02:03:35.160 --> 02:03:38.010
<v 3>I mean,
don't you think you're somebody who,
you said you,
you know,</v>

2110
02:03:38.011 --> 02:03:41.250
and I know this about you,
you love space.
You're,
you're obsessed with that.

2111
02:03:41.280 --> 02:03:44.970
The idea of what we are in,
in the solar system and beyond,

2112
02:03:44.971 --> 02:03:49.470
like how impossible is it to think that there could be a creature that could

2113
02:03:49.471 --> 02:03:53.490
breach our atmosphere with some advanced technology and be able to just sort of

2114
02:03:53.491 --> 02:03:55.860
chill,
you know,
scoot around,

2115
02:03:55.861 --> 02:03:58.620
scoot scoots Magoon's check us out and fucking piece out,

2116
02:03:58.621 --> 02:04:01.680
back up to wherever they're from.
I don't think that's how they would do it,

2117
02:04:01.681 --> 02:04:05.620
but yeah,
I know what you're saying.
Exactly.
They schools,
schools.

2118
02:04:06.660 --> 02:04:09.450
Yeah.
They just kind of cruise around.
You know,
they're looking at us.
Well,

2119
02:04:09.451 --> 02:04:11.070
he had an interest or common sense.

2120
02:04:11.220 --> 02:04:15.050
<v 0>He said,
if you brought a,
um,
uh,
uh,
uh,</v>

2121
02:04:15.360 --> 02:04:20.360
an atomic engine to these people that live in the Victorian era and said,

2122
02:04:20.431 --> 02:04:24.660
hey,
this is a,
this is a nuclear power plant,
like here,
here,

2123
02:04:24.720 --> 02:04:27.270
check this out.
They would fuck with it.

2124
02:04:27.300 --> 02:04:30.150
They'd wind up getting sick from radiation.
They'd wind up dying.

2125
02:04:30.180 --> 02:04:32.520
No one would understand what it was or how it worked.

2126
02:04:32.730 --> 02:04:34.890
They would never figure it out.
Right.
He goes,

2127
02:04:34.920 --> 02:04:38.400
why would we assume that this is

2128
02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:42.420
<v 2>only from that one time with this one device?</v>

2129
02:04:42.421 --> 02:04:45.960
Why would we assume that there'd be some other technology that maybe we'll

2130
02:04:45.961 --> 02:04:49.110
create some day in the future?
I'm paraphrasing him very poorly.

2131
02:04:49.560 --> 02:04:53.820
Or someone else from another planet would create that we wouldn't understand at

2132
02:04:53.821 --> 02:04:57.000
all and he said that's what we were dealing with when we're trying to back

2133
02:04:57.001 --> 02:04:59.970
engineer the propulsion systems that these things use the,

2134
02:04:59.971 --> 02:05:04.380
they use some gravity based propulsion system and it was just something that

2135
02:05:04.381 --> 02:05:07.110
would manipulate gravity in front of it's very,
look,
I don't,

2136
02:05:07.170 --> 02:05:11.460
I'm too stupid to know the science of it.
I don't know if he's like,

2137
02:05:11.461 --> 02:05:15.210
if you were a scientist you're supposed to know I have to get my degree,

2138
02:05:15.790 --> 02:05:20.550
get a degree so I can call us.
You should just want to get an honorary one.

2139
02:05:20.551 --> 02:05:25.470
Like Cosby Hud.
It's gone now.

2140
02:05:25.471 --> 02:05:28.920
He doesn't have a honorary ones.
They can take back.

2141
02:05:31.700 --> 02:05:32.850
You can't keep that.

2142
02:05:33.060 --> 02:05:35.820
Actually I think he wrote an essay and that's how they gave him his doctorate

2143
02:05:36.110 --> 02:05:39.000
and that's neither here nor there.
Probably got more than one doctorate.

2144
02:05:39.500 --> 02:05:42.420
Sherry did and he did.
It didn't deserve them.
But I think,

2145
02:05:42.421 --> 02:05:44.750
I mean there's gotta be stuff out there.
Oh,

2146
02:05:44.780 --> 02:05:49.560
a hundred percent a hundred percent but I like to say there's not,

2147
02:05:49.860 --> 02:05:53.910
it's like,
ah,
stop.
No,
no,
I don't think it is,

2148
02:05:54.120 --> 02:05:57.870
but it is entirely possible.
Um,

2149
02:05:58.290 --> 02:06:00.900
I use that phrase too often and it's entirely possible.

2150
02:06:00.960 --> 02:06:03.390
You've got to get a mash up of all of those.

2151
02:06:03.750 --> 02:06:08.040
It's of out there hilarious.
150,000 of them

2152
02:06:09.750 --> 02:06:13.080
to be uninsured.
It's possible that we're the,
we're the most advanced.

2153
02:06:13.140 --> 02:06:16.840
That's possible too because something has to be the most advanced.
Absolutely.

2154
02:06:16.860 --> 02:06:17.910
And something has to be the least.

2155
02:06:17.910 --> 02:06:21.300
We could also be on that part of the spectrum or maybe where the last two we

2156
02:06:21.301 --> 02:06:24.810
evolve.
It's a hundred percent a hundred percent possible.
And if there's,

2157
02:06:24.811 --> 02:06:28.350
if there's an infinite number of life forms out there,

2158
02:06:28.351 --> 02:06:31.500
like if there's an infinite number of planets and there's an infinite number of

2159
02:06:31.501 --> 02:06:35.490
earth,
like planets that could know have beings like us on it,

2160
02:06:36.330 --> 02:06:39.090
who's to say that we're not the most advanced?

2161
02:06:39.480 --> 02:06:41.940
Maybe they're all like people from the 1820s.

2162
02:06:42.300 --> 02:06:45.250
They haven't caught up to the ceiling shit.
They're still doing,
you know,

2163
02:06:45.260 --> 02:06:48.600
I don't think they chiseled chisels,
but I'm talking like old old shit.

2164
02:06:48.601 --> 02:06:51.440
They don't even have pens and papers yet.
Like the Orangutan.

2165
02:06:51.450 --> 02:06:52.880
It was fishing with a spear.
Exactly.

2166
02:06:52.890 --> 02:06:55.560
There's just a bunch of advanced orangutans that are like,
you know,

2167
02:06:55.590 --> 02:06:57.780
putting hieroglyphics and caves.
It's possible.

2168
02:06:58.620 --> 02:07:00.390
It's totally possible because we're just,

2169
02:07:00.450 --> 02:07:03.630
we're just basing it off of our own experience and perception of what we have

2170
02:07:03.631 --> 02:07:06.960
been exposed to.
The other,
um,

2171
02:07:07.380 --> 02:07:11.380
really interesting scenario is that there are time travelers,
oh,

2172
02:07:12.420 --> 02:07:14.610
that's exciting to think about are,

2173
02:07:14.640 --> 02:07:19.640
is some being from the far distant future that understands that it could come

2174
02:07:19.741 --> 02:07:23.970
back and observe us and see like where things went wrong,

2175
02:07:23.971 --> 02:07:24.691
where things went right,

2176
02:07:24.691 --> 02:07:28.470
but do so in a way that's as minimally intrusive as possible and occasionally

2177
02:07:28.471 --> 02:07:30.810
interfere.
That's things that gives me chills.

2178
02:07:30.811 --> 02:07:35.010
That freaks me out once you start fucking with time and our perception of it,

2179
02:07:35.110 --> 02:07:36.010
how it exists

2180
02:07:36.040 --> 02:07:38.620
<v 3>in like being able to hop along that spectrum of,</v>

2181
02:07:38.621 --> 02:07:41.290
it freaks me the fuck out.

2182
02:07:41.320 --> 02:07:45.100
There's this movie I saw called a ghost story and it's not a horror movie.

2183
02:07:45.101 --> 02:07:46.210
It's kind of about that.

2184
02:07:49.030 --> 02:07:53.050
It's a Casey Affleck and Rooney Mara,
I think.
Rooney.
Rooney Mara.

2185
02:07:53.410 --> 02:07:58.100
It no ghost.
I Ms. Patrick Swayze.
He's so much.

2186
02:07:58.640 --> 02:08:00.730
I miss him.
He's one of those actors.
I love.

2187
02:08:00.870 --> 02:08:05.580
If you could bring Patrick Swayze back and and take away your full house boy,

2188
02:08:06.070 --> 02:08:08.880
who dare you.
What's his name again?

2189
02:08:09.720 --> 02:08:13.480
Joseph Nathaniel Rogan.
I don't know.

2190
02:08:20.560 --> 02:08:24.840
I mean that's a tough call.
I mean,
Swayze gave us,

2191
02:08:24.870 --> 02:08:28.400
he gave us dirty dancing.
He gave us a look at that.

2192
02:08:29.760 --> 02:08:33.120
What a beautiful man.
He could move those hips.
Those when he was a surfer,

2193
02:08:33.590 --> 02:08:35.940
that was point break.
He was the rebel surf.

2194
02:08:35.941 --> 02:08:40.941
Do do you remember the video on Sarah at live of him and Chris Farley doing the

2195
02:08:41.140 --> 02:08:44.910
Chippendales audition?
Iconic.
That's iconic comedy.

2196
02:08:44.911 --> 02:08:48.420
That is like such a great crossroads between beauty

2197
02:08:50.690 --> 02:08:55.280
and Chris Farley.
Chris Farley put it all out on the table during the sketch.

2198
02:08:55.630 --> 02:08:59.000
It is so funny,
Miss,
I really do Ms. Patrick Swayze,

2199
02:08:59.001 --> 02:09:03.210
but I Crucey that he was so fit.
But yeah,
he smokes cigarettes.
He did it.

2200
02:09:03.250 --> 02:09:07.970
Did he really probably have cancer.
He probably smoked cigarettes to stay fit.

2201
02:09:07.971 --> 02:09:09.050
Some people get stuck in that,

2202
02:09:09.051 --> 02:09:13.010
you know they are afraid of letting it go because they think it helps with their

2203
02:09:13.011 --> 02:09:17.920
physique and in maintaining the look on a models.
Do that.
Staying skinny.

2204
02:09:18.130 --> 02:09:19.430
Yeah.
Cause you know it's a,

2205
02:09:19.431 --> 02:09:22.490
it's an upper increases your heart rate and all that and whatnot.

2206
02:09:22.610 --> 02:09:26.240
It also kills your appetite.
I think.
Totally kills your taste bud.

2207
02:09:26.241 --> 02:09:30.740
You can't taste anything.
Everything is destroyed.
Maybe you should smoke.

2208
02:09:30.770 --> 02:09:33.440
That's the only way you should look at us is by smoking cigarettes.

2209
02:09:33.441 --> 02:09:38.360
They don't taste it like you have to.
You have to choose God.

2210
02:09:38.361 --> 02:09:42.560
This is brutal dude.
You're making me lose Stamos and get hookworm.

2211
02:09:42.800 --> 02:09:47.030
I'm just saying stay.
Most are Swayze stamus all day bro.
Stamos for life.

2212
02:09:47.330 --> 02:09:51.560
Sorry Swayze.
See on the other side will be,
and I will be messaging you later.

2213
02:09:51.590 --> 02:09:55.430
Stop for a moment.
Really reconsider what you're saying.

2214
02:09:55.460 --> 02:09:59.400
Think about the great films Swayze provided us with.
Okay,

2215
02:09:59.401 --> 02:10:01.670
I will bitch.

2216
02:10:05.060 --> 02:10:08.040
All of mankind's entertainment falls on my shoulders.

2217
02:10:08.220 --> 02:10:13.190
Road House also,
you know,

2218
02:10:14.010 --> 02:10:15.180
I know now.
I feel bad.

2219
02:10:15.400 --> 02:10:19.530
When you look at his IMD be posted for Roadhouse,

2220
02:10:20.090 --> 02:10:23.430
you're either going through 10 seasons,
a full house or roadhouse

2221
02:10:28.560 --> 02:10:31.910
roadhouse,
dude.
Okay.

2222
02:10:33.410 --> 02:10:38.210
And selfishly it's Stamos split on an overall spectrum and Swayze all time for

2223
02:10:38.211 --> 02:10:40.880
mankind.
I will.
I'm sorry Kaitlin.

2224
02:10:40.980 --> 02:10:43.370
I'm going to have to go with Swayze Swayze all day.

2225
02:10:43.400 --> 02:10:45.980
That's what we said we're going to start doing.
Jamie is doing,

2226
02:10:45.981 --> 02:10:50.200
I'm like fight companions for like terrible movies.
Oh,

2227
02:10:50.210 --> 02:10:54.080
Swayze again.
Stamos we should get barbecued and place showgirls

2228
02:10:56.450 --> 02:11:00.920
25th anniversary.
You have to,
people don't even know,
Dude.

2229
02:11:00.921 --> 02:11:04.040
Showgirls is a cult classic.
It's an amazingly bad movie.

2230
02:11:04.460 --> 02:11:07.520
It's so epically bad.
It's kind of like what?
What?

2231
02:11:07.600 --> 02:11:11.210
How I felt when I watched the dirt recently.
It ended this Gal's career.

2232
02:11:11.420 --> 02:11:16.010
It did it basically.
No,
not at all,
didn't it?
No.

2233
02:11:16.220 --> 02:11:19.700
Did she take off after that?
She stayed.
She stayed pretty plateau,

2234
02:11:20.090 --> 02:11:23.810
but she was the,
she was on her way to being a gigantic superstar.

2235
02:11:24.270 --> 02:11:27.830
She's The star of this movie.
She's super hot.
She's half naked.

2236
02:11:28.040 --> 02:11:32.510
She took this movie.
I'm speculating,
but I thought she took this movie because,

2237
02:11:32.570 --> 02:11:37.570
because it was going to be the next thing and ended up being such a such a

2238
02:11:38.510 --> 02:11:43.460
brutal failure that maybe,
I don't know.
It's so good.
It's so bad.

2239
02:11:43.461 --> 02:11:44.720
It's good.
It's crazy.

2240
02:11:44.960 --> 02:11:49.140
And it's got great actors in a two [inaudible] clock.

2241
02:11:49.800 --> 02:11:53.490
A great actor.
She's not a Christian.
I have a bad actress.

2242
02:11:54.340 --> 02:11:58.850
She was amazing.
She was in bye bye Birdie with stay Molson on Broadway.

2243
02:11:58.970 --> 02:12:02.480
She was amazing.
What's the cast who scroll back all the way up to the top?

2244
02:12:02.570 --> 02:12:05.480
That is a great case.
Go to all,
not just images.

2245
02:12:05.540 --> 02:12:10.250
I mean her body was amazing in this,
obviously it's kind of like,
um,

2246
02:12:10.610 --> 02:12:15.350
number to me more.
When she did that stripper movie as well,
she was a GI Jane.

2247
02:12:15.710 --> 02:12:18.530
She was amazing in Gi Jane,
but didn't do me more,

2248
02:12:18.531 --> 02:12:20.210
do a stripper movement part Gij,

2249
02:12:20.211 --> 02:12:23.810
Elizabeth Berkley and my favorite part in Geo James,
when she says,
suck my Dick.

2250
02:12:23.900 --> 02:12:27.430
I was like,
hmm,
I need to put that on a tee shirt.
No,

2251
02:12:27.440 --> 02:12:29.690
just she said suck my Dick.
And then,
yeah,

2252
02:12:29.990 --> 02:12:34.590
she was like on her way to being a navy seal.
That's great.
General Gi Jane,

2253
02:12:34.591 --> 02:12:37.410
she's going through bootcamp.
I remember those like

2254
02:12:39.390 --> 02:12:40.223
triptease

2255
02:12:41.480 --> 02:12:46.480
Dude Demean Moore's body and strip tease was all the things she was so bang in

2256
02:12:48.410 --> 02:12:53.240
that movie.
She's so beautiful.
I just from,
I mean we be burned into your head.

2257
02:12:53.300 --> 02:12:57.030
It's just one of those movies that I remember she was,

2258
02:12:57.170 --> 02:13:01.520
she was like jacked in that movie and in dancing very awkwardly.

2259
02:13:01.850 --> 02:13:05.600
The very awkward stripper dance that happened.
I just going on with that outfit.

2260
02:13:05.940 --> 02:13:07.340
It looks like she belongs on a wedding cake.

2261
02:13:07.790 --> 02:13:10.880
Something on a television show or tonight show.
It was like Telemundo.

2262
02:13:11.930 --> 02:13:15.380
What do you think she's doing these days?
Some people get super,

2263
02:13:15.381 --> 02:13:18.350
super famous where they're everywhere and then they go,
I'm done.

2264
02:13:18.560 --> 02:13:21.470
I think she's just chilling.
You think so?
I hope so.

2265
02:13:21.471 --> 02:13:24.480
I hope she's just chilling and just Kinda,
you know what?
What?
What?

2266
02:13:24.500 --> 02:13:29.060
Was she going to do?
Another movie?
Maybe?
Maybe in India?
Absolutely.

2267
02:13:29.061 --> 02:13:32.490
She maybe she should do,
I don't know.
It would tap into a different

2268
02:13:32.670 --> 02:13:37.040
<v 2>era.
We haven't seen.
Give me where she's good,</v>

2269
02:13:37.041 --> 02:13:39.030
where she is.
I she's taking a break.
You know,

2270
02:13:39.031 --> 02:13:43.860
we got a couple of projects on the table.
I don't know what she's going to do.

2271
02:13:44.010 --> 02:13:47.160
I don't know either.
Who's didn't expect you to like defend yourself

2272
02:13:51.960 --> 02:13:56.400
and I'm like,
no one's pressuring me.
Jessie Mae who is marijuana?

2273
02:13:56.401 --> 02:13:59.940
You're still high all I've been high for four days.
Oh,

2274
02:13:59.941 --> 02:14:03.390
who's your celebrity crush?
I don't have one.
You don't know.
I'm good.

2275
02:14:03.720 --> 02:14:07.380
You don't have like a,
like a fantasy,
you know like a fantasy chick.

2276
02:14:07.940 --> 02:14:12.210
Maybe Madonna from the 80s wow.
She was young.
Bold choice.

2277
02:14:12.720 --> 02:14:15.840
Pointee bra was also,
you know that she was never going to get hooked on.

2278
02:14:15.841 --> 02:14:20.060
You should take off.
He'd be able to go
take care.

2279
02:14:23.210 --> 02:14:25.110
I liked her because she knew she wouldn't like me.

2280
02:14:25.380 --> 02:14:29.430
I knew she wouldn't like me for long.
That's a real strategy that men,

2281
02:14:29.580 --> 02:14:32.520
some men employed like this one's not going to last.
It's great.

2282
02:14:32.790 --> 02:14:36.690
That's an honest answer.
It really is.
Yeah.
That's the,

2283
02:14:36.750 --> 02:14:41.190
that's the allure of the positive,
independent woman.
Powerful,
positive,

2284
02:14:41.220 --> 02:14:46.050
independent woman.
It was like,
she's just not nice.
It's not needy at all.

2285
02:14:46.051 --> 02:14:49.050
She's like,
yeah,
well see ya.
There she is dirt

2286
02:14:50.630 --> 02:14:55.170
from the,
that's all real too.
It was notes from her closet for sure.

2287
02:14:55.171 --> 02:15:00.171
She's in like dudes briefs and some like doilies on her legs and apparently she

2288
02:15:00.320 --> 02:15:04.440
learnt though.
Fuck.
You know what I'm saying?
Like to Smash said Warren Beatty.

2289
02:15:04.441 --> 02:15:09.240
Sean Penn to see this movie that these,
this is the three identical.

2290
02:15:10.500 --> 02:15:12.570
These are the twins or the documentary is about,

2291
02:15:12.571 --> 02:15:15.660
you haven't seen three identical strangers.
No,
I heard it's amazing.

2292
02:15:15.780 --> 02:15:17.760
I almost brought it up the other day cause you guys started talking about

2293
02:15:17.761 --> 02:15:19.650
something,
I forget what podcast it was,

2294
02:15:20.460 --> 02:15:23.690
that this movie sort of bleeds into not spoiler alert because this movie's power

2295
02:15:25.170 --> 02:15:29.190
genetic testing type shit back in the day,
like in the,
in the 50s right.

2296
02:15:29.191 --> 02:15:33.270
They were doing it like in the fifties and sixties in an in like an orphanage.

2297
02:15:33.510 --> 02:15:37.530
Yeah.
I need to find some time to watch that because everybody recommends it.

2298
02:15:38.130 --> 02:15:42.510
Just when you think like a revelation happens and you're like,
what the fuck?

2299
02:15:42.870 --> 02:15:45.510
And then another one happens,
you're like,
this has got to stop.

2300
02:15:46.020 --> 02:15:47.790
And then you're just like,
holy hell.

2301
02:15:48.210 --> 02:15:51.390
And then it's just a thing where if somebody wants to get something done,

2302
02:15:51.391 --> 02:15:53.880
sometimes they take really drastic measures.

2303
02:15:54.330 --> 02:15:58.740
It's selfish and it's terrible and it breaks all ethical,
you know,

2304
02:15:58.830 --> 02:16:02.520
rules.
But I don't know there could they do it?
Well,

2305
02:16:02.580 --> 02:16:05.800
we're spoiler alert out for a while.

2306
02:16:05.801 --> 02:16:08.070
Do it as an experiment on these guys on purpose.

2307
02:16:08.670 --> 02:16:11.160
There's a psychologist who wanted to find out stuff

2308
02:16:14.480 --> 02:16:19.480
running an orphanage in withholding information from the families to find out

2309
02:16:21.001 --> 02:16:24.690
how it would work out.
What they were doing was nature versus nurture.
They were,

2310
02:16:24.720 --> 02:16:29.490
they were seeing what affects it has on a child.
Um,

2311
02:16:29.530 --> 02:16:34.530
based on how it's raised by also by the socioeconomic status of the family,

2312
02:16:35.380 --> 02:16:39.010
about the neighborhood.
It's in,
about the type of unit,
the love,

2313
02:16:39.040 --> 02:16:42.880
all of those factors and what results it has on the individual.
Right.

2314
02:16:42.881 --> 02:16:44.940
What don't you say,
Jamie?
That's kind of the data.

2315
02:16:44.990 --> 02:16:48.460
They have a bunch of data apparently somewhere and it never came out.

2316
02:16:48.461 --> 02:16:51.400
It's missing,
it's gone.
The files are just gone.

2317
02:16:51.430 --> 02:16:55.930
Disappeared years of them basically ruining the lives of children and the

2318
02:16:55.931 --> 02:16:59.360
effects of that is just dissipated into thinner.
It's such a,

2319
02:16:59.361 --> 02:17:02.260
it's such a heartbreaking story,
but it's also very interesting.

2320
02:17:03.190 --> 02:17:04.780
And that's what I'm saying,
like how would you ever,

2321
02:17:05.830 --> 02:17:09.760
not that that needs to happen,
but there is a question.
I mean,
you're a father,

2322
02:17:11.400 --> 02:17:15.880
right?
I mean we could look at like all the things that are happening in society,

2323
02:17:15.881 --> 02:17:19.360
especially with like mass shooters and people who commit these random acts of

2324
02:17:19.361 --> 02:17:21.880
violence and go back to their upbringing and their rearing.

2325
02:17:22.090 --> 02:17:25.510
I'm pretty sure I would take a gander and a guest that they probably weren't

2326
02:17:25.511 --> 02:17:26.830
raised with the most amount of love.

2327
02:17:26.860 --> 02:17:31.120
There's certain things that you don't really know how it's gonna work out until

2328
02:17:31.121 --> 02:17:34.780
you experiment.
Yeah.
And that's what I was saying,
like it's a little brutal,

2329
02:17:34.781 --> 02:17:36.670
but what people are scared of,
that kind of thing.

2330
02:17:36.671 --> 02:17:37.870
Cause that's where Hitler came from.

2331
02:17:38.380 --> 02:17:43.120
That kind of thinking about some of the experiments they did on people.
Man,

2332
02:17:43.330 --> 02:17:45.160
that was just scary.

2333
02:17:45.440 --> 02:17:49.720
Doctor supposedly I think came in with the operation paperclip.
Oh Jeez.

2334
02:17:50.920 --> 02:17:54.690
Oh my God,
that's hard.
It's,
it's pretty fucked up.
It's,
it's,

2335
02:17:54.750 --> 02:17:57.280
you know what operation paperclip was?
Well,

2336
02:17:57.281 --> 02:18:01.220
isn't that something like a Hitler thing back in the day with babies?
No,
no,
no.

2337
02:18:01.221 --> 02:18:04.220
It was the Nazi scientists that were taken from World War II,

2338
02:18:04.590 --> 02:18:08.860
so the United States took Nazi scientists,
including Warner von Braun,

2339
02:18:08.861 --> 02:18:09.800
who was the head of NASA,

2340
02:18:10.540 --> 02:18:15.540
a bunch of other scientists and all these Nazis that were working for Germany

2341
02:18:16.300 --> 02:18:19.780
making rockets and involved in like high level science.

2342
02:18:19.850 --> 02:18:23.200
I never brought them over to America and sort of whitewash the whole thing.

2343
02:18:23.201 --> 02:18:27.100
They called it operation paperclip,
Holy Werner.
Von Braun.

2344
02:18:27.101 --> 02:18:30.340
When he was at the head of NASA,
he was a fucking legitimate Nazi,

2345
02:18:30.580 --> 02:18:33.670
like the Simon Wiesenthal Center,
so that if he was alive today,

2346
02:18:33.671 --> 02:18:36.820
they would prosecute him for crimes against humanity.
I feel like there's still,

2347
02:18:36.821 --> 02:18:37.061
you know,

2348
02:18:37.061 --> 02:18:42.061
there's still a sprinkling of people in there that sort of Dave chase these guys

2349
02:18:43.481 --> 02:18:46.360
down to the far ends of the earth and a bunch of them.

2350
02:18:46.450 --> 02:18:49.000
Those are very powerful positions to be in,

2351
02:18:49.060 --> 02:18:53.140
to have that sort of mentality driving it.
That's scary as fuck for sure.

2352
02:18:53.141 --> 02:18:56.470
You know what's really crazy is Argentina,
Argentina,

2353
02:18:56.471 --> 02:19:01.090
and South America a lot.
And Nazis went to Argentina and South America.

2354
02:19:01.091 --> 02:19:04.870
They fled Germany.
And Tim Kennedy,
who's a good friend of mine,

2355
02:19:04.871 --> 02:19:07.180
who was a former UFC fighters,
a soldier,

2356
02:19:07.570 --> 02:19:11.950
he was on a show called finding Hitler,
where there was,

2357
02:19:12.250 --> 02:19:17.250
there's been speculation over the years because so many Nazis landed in South

2358
02:19:17.771 --> 02:19:22.771
America that Hitler had escaped and lived out his life in,

2359
02:19:23.170 --> 02:19:27.590
in,
you know,
protected by these other Nazis.
And these South American towns,

2360
02:19:28.430 --> 02:19:32.030
there's towns in South America too.
There's towns in South America where they,

2361
02:19:32.031 --> 02:19:36.710
all they do is speak German.
They have October fast.

2362
02:19:36.740 --> 02:19:40.940
They have photographs on their walls of their grandfather in ss garb.

2363
02:19:41.210 --> 02:19:44.210
That is very,
very scary.
Oh dude,
it's crazy.

2364
02:19:45.020 --> 02:19:47.660
He blew me away when he was telling me about this and,
and that.

2365
02:19:47.700 --> 02:19:50.450
He's a no nonsense guy.
So when he's explaining,
he's like,

2366
02:19:50.451 --> 02:19:54.740
you've got to understand you're coming into these towns.
Everyone is German.

2367
02:19:54.920 --> 02:19:59.030
Oh my God.
They all look like Germans.
They all talk German.

2368
02:19:59.330 --> 02:20:02.470
They all have German like houses and German,

2369
02:20:02.610 --> 02:20:06.140
like German style stuff in their house.

2370
02:20:06.410 --> 02:20:11.150
This bizarre fucking crazy.
What happened?
I don't know.

2371
02:20:11.270 --> 02:20:13.810
No,
it's maybe not what happened to Hitler,
right?

2372
02:20:13.820 --> 02:20:16.460
They're pretty sure the Hitler died,
but I'm sure they relocated it.

2373
02:20:16.480 --> 02:20:19.520
That's definitely what happened.
They said,
see if you can find that.

2374
02:20:20.010 --> 02:20:22.430
Jamie will find something that will blow you away.

2375
02:20:22.440 --> 02:20:26.620
This is just a South America look.
It looks like a German town,
Dude.

2376
02:20:26.660 --> 02:20:27.740
It's crazy.

2377
02:20:28.220 --> 02:20:32.000
There's a whole village of these fucking people and there's not just one.

2378
02:20:32.030 --> 02:20:36.710
There's many,
many of these little little pockets that looks like an October bar.

2379
02:20:37.280 --> 02:20:40.820
That's really bizarre.
I mean,
that one looks a little Japanese that well,

2380
02:20:40.821 --> 02:20:42.740
there's videos though.
It's really crazy.

2381
02:20:42.741 --> 02:20:46.940
They're drinking out of steins and like the whole deal means are really wild,

2382
02:20:46.941 --> 02:20:49.970
dude.
It's crazy.
Obviously we couldn't get them all.
I mean,

2383
02:20:50.210 --> 02:20:54.020
they had to flee somewhere and they're going to set up shop,
make it there.

2384
02:20:54.021 --> 02:20:55.520
You know,
make it,
they're homogenous.

2385
02:20:55.760 --> 02:20:58.220
They saw the shit was about to hit the fan and said,
listen,

2386
02:20:58.670 --> 02:21:02.780
I know a place we can get some cool Margarita's.
We can catch some fucking toast.

2387
02:21:06.830 --> 02:21:09.200
South America,
South America.

2388
02:21:11.270 --> 02:21:15.980
That's a wild.
I never knew that.
Oh,
it's,
yeah,
I didn't know it either.
It's crazy.

2389
02:21:16.010 --> 02:21:20.140
It's really crazy.
I see.
Man thinks is too much to know.
There is too much snow,

2390
02:21:20.150 --> 02:21:23.180
but it's one of the great things about the stuff you talk about on this is you

2391
02:21:23.181 --> 02:21:27.770
got to it,
but just like a plethora of information.
Useless.
Most of it's useless.

2392
02:21:27.830 --> 02:21:31.850
Most of it's useless.
It's useless.
Wasted wasting time.
You know what?

2393
02:21:31.851 --> 02:21:36.590
I'm going to do anything with it,
dude.
I've been taking CBD with THC.
Oh,

2394
02:21:36.591 --> 02:21:40.210
that's great.
He delivers it.
Got a bit of a problem.
What's the matter bill?

2395
02:21:40.240 --> 02:21:44.330
I've been high every day for the last six days.
I pop these little uh,

2396
02:21:44.570 --> 02:21:47.360
tablets in the morning.
It's CBD and THC.

2397
02:21:47.361 --> 02:21:51.920
It's not a lot of senior one and w yeah,
it's one to one.
Perfect.
It's amazing.

2398
02:21:52.500 --> 02:21:53.300
You know,
the,
the,

2399
02:21:53.300 --> 02:21:56.780
they work with each other and they help the teach see helps deliver the CBD and

2400
02:21:56.781 --> 02:22:01.550
vice versa.
You feel great.
You feel balanced.
You feel like energized.
Clay,

2401
02:22:01.620 --> 02:22:04.430
clear.
I don't know about you.
I feel clear.
No,
no problem.

2402
02:22:04.431 --> 02:22:08.480
In terms of like feeling foggy or fatigued,
it's just the right amount.

2403
02:22:08.481 --> 02:22:12.170
But I fucked up and took one an hour before I went to bed last night.

2404
02:22:12.171 --> 02:22:14.890
I went to bed at a sensible time.
I knew I was going to do a podcast with Jessie.

2405
02:22:14.990 --> 02:22:17.300
I'm like,
I want to be awake and fresh.

2406
02:22:18.050 --> 02:22:22.620
And then I got you based so that's fine.
But I,
I went to bed and uh,

2407
02:22:22.630 --> 02:22:25.860
I had taken one,
like an hour or so before I was in bed.

2408
02:22:25.861 --> 02:22:30.720
I woke up two o'clock in the morning,
Bang,
freight train,
fill of ideas.

2409
02:22:31.260 --> 02:22:35.410
Blam I wrote,
did you write some stuff down the road?
That's cool.
I have,

2410
02:22:35.430 --> 02:22:38.880
I keep my laptop right now by the bed.
I started doing it,
the bill,

2411
02:22:39.420 --> 02:22:43.860
I just near it near in the bathroom next to the bed.
Literally if a,

2412
02:22:44.370 --> 02:22:45.870
usually everyone's else asleep.

2413
02:22:45.900 --> 02:22:49.230
I grab the laptop and I just go into the other room and I just start writing.

2414
02:22:49.231 --> 02:22:51.870
But I keep it in the bag.
I put it right by my bed.

2415
02:22:51.871 --> 02:22:54.690
So if I have an idea in my head twice,

2416
02:22:54.840 --> 02:22:59.840
I've written bits that came out to be like real legitimate bits because an idea

2417
02:23:00.781 --> 02:23:03.990
came to me while I was lying there and I said I got to just try this and I just

2418
02:23:03.991 --> 02:23:07.440
run in the other room and I start writing and then boom it becomes a bit,

2419
02:23:07.530 --> 02:23:11.070
not Hawaii twice over the last year,

2420
02:23:11.100 --> 02:23:16.100
like legitimate bits have come out of just a random thought that it was popping

2421
02:23:16.231 --> 02:23:18.730
through my mind while I was laying in bed.
Now were you,
uh,

2422
02:23:18.960 --> 02:23:21.210
were you on the marijuana's both times?

2423
02:23:21.660 --> 02:23:23.610
I mean there's something to it definitely when you,

2424
02:23:23.670 --> 02:23:27.570
when you have a moment to escape because their brains like an onion dated with

2425
02:23:27.571 --> 02:23:31.200
information all the time.
Just daydreaming,
being bored.

2426
02:23:31.710 --> 02:23:35.430
That's where the creativity for me is the most active.

2427
02:23:35.431 --> 02:23:40.170
Like getting a good napper even just in a dream you think of something like in

2428
02:23:40.171 --> 02:23:42.330
the shower or driving.
Those are my ideas.

2429
02:23:42.890 --> 02:23:46.380
I've had this similar situation where I'm like,
oh this might be a good joke.

2430
02:23:46.500 --> 02:23:49.210
Cause that's my argument for ignoring phones to the,

2431
02:23:49.211 --> 02:23:52.170
the allow yourself to get bored.
And when you allow yourself to get bored,

2432
02:23:52.171 --> 02:23:55.650
then that's when these creative ideas will come.
Look if you're in your car,

2433
02:23:55.800 --> 02:23:58.080
like they'll see the thing about that little car that I was telling you about.

2434
02:23:58.230 --> 02:24:01.080
It doesn't have a radio.
Oh that's great.
I know radio.

2435
02:24:01.140 --> 02:24:03.850
So you have to daydream you.
You're not just Dave,
you're,

2436
02:24:03.990 --> 02:24:08.990
it's like you're tuned into the thing as you're doing a blind man and you think

2437
02:24:09.061 --> 02:24:09.894
about stuff like,

2438
02:24:09.900 --> 02:24:13.080
I used to come up with some of my best bits when I first started doing comedy,

2439
02:24:13.110 --> 02:24:14.580
when I was delivering newspapers,

2440
02:24:14.970 --> 02:24:17.330
I would deliver newspapers in the morning and out of my car,

2441
02:24:17.340 --> 02:24:21.780
chuck them out the window.
How old were you?
21.
Wow.
And um,
when I was doing that,

2442
02:24:21.810 --> 02:24:25.080
I would come up with some of my best bits.
When I wasn't listening to the radio,

2443
02:24:25.110 --> 02:24:29.510
I was just driving around.
And then I'd have an idea of what,
why is it that we,

2444
02:24:29.580 --> 02:24:31.020
what the fuck is this about?

2445
02:24:31.480 --> 02:24:36.120
Just be thinking to myself almost like those hours became productive.

2446
02:24:36.150 --> 02:24:36.983
They are

2447
02:24:38.480 --> 02:24:41.250
daydreaming has probably one of the most important things you can do for your

2448
02:24:41.251 --> 02:24:45.030
brain,
especially for creative people and people in general.
You know,

2449
02:24:45.031 --> 02:24:48.510
I think when you're doing something that requires you to do something

2450
02:24:48.511 --> 02:24:53.040
mechanically,
like driving,
even just washing your body paper route,

2451
02:24:53.310 --> 02:24:58.310
anything that you sort of have to do this like regular machine thing,

2452
02:24:58.620 --> 02:25:03.620
your brain sort of just can roam in the woods and just pick off little ideas off

2453
02:25:03.751 --> 02:25:08.220
the trees and you know,
you're able to sort of give your brain a break.
Yeah.

2454
02:25:08.221 --> 02:25:12.750
Your brain doesn't always need to be stimulated externally.
Fuck No.

2455
02:25:12.980 --> 02:25:13.680
That's though,

2456
02:25:13.680 --> 02:25:18.000
that's probably one of the causes of mental illness that probably it is

2457
02:25:18.001 --> 02:25:21.180
attributed to a lot of neurological issues down the road.

2458
02:25:22.310 --> 02:25:24.790
Your brain needs a break,
you know,

2459
02:25:24.940 --> 02:25:27.760
those synapses can be firing all the fucking time.
They got shit to do.

2460
02:25:27.890 --> 02:25:32.560
I guess you'll give him a nap.
I'm exhausted.
You know,

2461
02:25:32.590 --> 02:25:34.360
the brain needs a break.
But yeah,
I definitely,

2462
02:25:34.361 --> 02:25:38.110
I think of random things sometimes in the shower.
Yeah,
you can.

2463
02:25:38.140 --> 02:25:41.540
You can do that while you're driving.
You can do that while you're in the shower.

2464
