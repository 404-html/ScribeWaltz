<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you a celebrity?</v>

<v Speaker 1>Like in front of everyone was nuts.</v>

19
00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:39.960
<v Speaker 1>Why would celebrities not want to go</v>
<v Speaker 1>through it?</v>

20
00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:42.570
<v Speaker 1>But it's like,</v>

00:00:48.251 --> 00:00:51.850
<v Speaker 2>Everyone has been pleasant with me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Graham Hancock,</v>

24
00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.950
<v Speaker 2>who's been on the podcast several times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's a good friend.</v>

25
00:00:55.330 --> 00:01:00.330
<v Speaker 2>He went through one and he said this</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude like just was aggressively sexual</v>

<v Speaker 2>like it felt like he was being molested,</v>

28
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.060
<v Speaker 2>like I shouldn't say aggressively</v>
<v Speaker 2>sexual,</v>

29
00:01:07.061 --> 00:01:10.690
<v Speaker 2>but he grabbed his cock and the whole</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing mean like he said,</v>

30
00:01:10.691 --> 00:01:14.350
<v Speaker 2>it felt like he was getting raped,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like obviously not as extreme,</v>

31
00:01:14.351 --> 00:01:16.960
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like a form of a violation and he</v>

32
00:01:16.961 --> 00:01:19.060
<v Speaker 2>was really shocked by it and he wrote</v>
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>

33
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.340
<v Speaker 2>He was shocked enough that he didn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>just let it go.</v>

34
00:01:21.341 --> 00:01:22.350
<v Speaker 2>We sat down and wrote some stuff.</v>

35
00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.540
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was this report that came out that</v>

36
00:01:24.541 --> 00:01:29.190
<v Speaker 1>said that there's so many more cases of</v>
<v Speaker 1>malfeasance and misconduct and the Tsa</v>

37
00:01:29.191 --> 00:01:32.040
<v Speaker 1>than any other government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is like 20 times more.</v>

38
00:01:32.041 --> 00:01:33.930
<v Speaker 1>And so there was this investigation done</v>
<v Speaker 1>to find out,</v>

39
00:01:33.931 --> 00:01:37.170
<v Speaker 1>well why is there so much fucking crimes</v>
<v Speaker 1>happening?</v>

40
00:01:37.171 --> 00:01:40.650
<v Speaker 1>Like robbery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sexual abuse and stuff.</v>

41
00:01:40.651 --> 00:01:42.900
<v Speaker 1>And it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And basically this representative</v>

42
00:01:42.901 --> 00:01:45.330
<v Speaker 1>figured out that they don't really do</v>
<v Speaker 1>background checks.</v>

43
00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:47.310
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're just kind of skipping</v>

44
00:01:47.311 --> 00:01:48.500
<v Speaker 1>through this huge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

45
00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:49.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think that you would.</v>

46
00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.820
<v Speaker 1>So basically they're hiring a pedophiles</v>
<v Speaker 1>and child and lessors what they found</v>

47
00:01:53.821 --> 00:01:54.654
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

48
00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:55.300
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait.</v>

49
00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:56.133
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

50
00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.310
<v Speaker 2>Well not nice people too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We should,</v>

51
00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:00.790
<v Speaker 2>we should say that I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've met a lot of really nice people to</v>

52
00:02:00.791 --> 00:02:01.624
<v Speaker 2>Tsa.</v>

53
00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.870
<v Speaker 1>You fucking government chill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Relax.</v>

54
00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.720
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you think that you should do</v>

55
00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.120
<v Speaker 1>security?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We did before nine slash 11 was totally</v>

56
00:02:09.121 --> 00:02:11.030
<v Speaker 1>created in the wake of nine slash 11 is</v>
<v Speaker 1>a total thing.</v>

57
00:02:11.031 --> 00:02:12.570
<v Speaker 1>New Government Agency.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like the department,</v>

58
00:02:12.571 --> 00:02:15.120
<v Speaker 1>Homeland Security and just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean think about it,</v>

59
00:02:15.121 --> 00:02:19.830
<v Speaker 1>the hijackers brought on what knives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you can still bring those in.</v>

60
00:02:19.831 --> 00:02:24.030
<v Speaker 1>This Guy Jonathan corbet basically</v>
<v Speaker 1>expose the fact that you can just create</v>

61
00:02:24.031 --> 00:02:26.490
<v Speaker 1>an insole in pocket and bring in</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever the fuck you want through these</v>

62
00:02:26.491 --> 00:02:29.220
<v Speaker 1>body scanners.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they really have like a huge security</v>

63
00:02:29.221 --> 00:02:30.570
<v Speaker 1>breach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

64
00:02:30.571 --> 00:02:32.880
<v Speaker 1>But when you go back to why the body</v>
<v Speaker 1>scanners were implemented,</v>

65
00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.490
<v Speaker 1>like an inside pocket that's like silver</v>
<v Speaker 1>or something.</v>

66
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.270
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it has to be like,</v>

67
00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.320
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can carry anything through.</v>

68
00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.340
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

69
00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.680
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason that the body scanners were</v>

70
00:02:43.681 --> 00:02:45.240
<v Speaker 1>implemented in the first place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is Michael.</v>

71
00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.470
<v Speaker 1>Michael Chertoff was tied up with rape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rape,</v>

72
00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:51.330
<v Speaker 1>a scan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is also the name of the body</v>

73
00:02:51.331 --> 00:02:51.811
<v Speaker 1>scanner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

74
00:02:51.811 --> 00:02:53.080
<v Speaker 1>Rapiscan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rapid,</v>

75
00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:54.730
<v Speaker 1>rapid scan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I call</v>

76
00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.000
<v Speaker 1>the government was really</v>

77
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.873
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep,</v>

78
00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.620
<v Speaker 2>losing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got a patent rapiscan.</v>

79
00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.410
<v Speaker 2>I got a patent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not changing the fucking name.</v>

80
00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.180
<v Speaker 2>And then you understand it 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you ever the worst feeling in the</v>
