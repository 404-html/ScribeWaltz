00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:06.000
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do these patterns repeat themselves?</v>

2
00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:08.500
<v Speaker 1>What is it about human beings?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3
00:00:08.501 --> 00:00:11.500
<v Speaker 1>we like things simple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We like things simple.</v>

4
00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:16.860
<v Speaker 1>So C and then you often like a simple</v>
<v Speaker 1>explanation is a good explanation unless</v>

5
00:00:16.991 --> 00:00:19.930
<v Speaker 1>it's too simple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But distinguishing between simple and</v>

6
00:00:19.931 --> 00:00:22.540
<v Speaker 1>too simple is no easy matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We like,</v>

7
00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.280
<v Speaker 1>we like to know who's our friend and</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's our enemy and we like the feeling</v>

8
00:00:27.281 --> 00:00:30.530
<v Speaker 1>of under and moral superiority and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>learned morals,</v>

9
00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:34.600
<v Speaker 1>which had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when there is no such thing</v>

10
00:00:34.601 --> 00:00:37.150
<v Speaker 1>as earning anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

11
00:00:37.151 --> 00:00:39.250
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's deeper and darker things</v>

12
00:00:39.251 --> 00:00:42.760
<v Speaker 1>that are underneath that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the human proclivity to pull</v>

13
00:00:42.761 --> 00:00:46.660
<v Speaker 1>down those who have more than you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like these kids on the campuses who</v>

14
00:00:46.661 --> 00:00:49.150
<v Speaker 1>are claiming identity with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>oppressed,</v>

15
00:00:49.151 --> 00:00:50.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere like Yale.</v>

16
00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:55.780
<v Speaker 1>It's like how in the world you can speak</v>
<v Speaker 1>of oppression if you happened to be at</v>

17
00:00:55.781 --> 00:00:57.250
<v Speaker 1>Yale is beyond me.</v>

18
00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:58.420
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

19
00:00:58.421 --> 00:01:02.140
<v Speaker 1>your North American,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which puts you in the top 1% and then of</v>

20
00:01:02.141 --> 00:01:05.650
<v Speaker 1>North Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in the top 1% two in the top 1%</v>

21
00:01:05.651 --> 00:01:08.740
<v Speaker 1>of 1% but yet you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want that,</v>

22
00:01:08.741 --> 00:01:12.550
<v Speaker 1>you want to have all the power that goes</v>
<v Speaker 1>along with that and you want to have the</v>

23
00:01:12.551 --> 00:01:16.000
<v Speaker 1>moral superiority that comes from being</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

24
00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.340
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>representative of the oppressed.</v>

25
00:01:18.341 --> 00:01:21.520
<v Speaker 1>So that's exactly what you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want all the power and you want all</v>

26
00:01:21.521 --> 00:01:23.760
<v Speaker 1>the victimization at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

27
00:01:23.761 --> 00:01:26.340
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yale is a great example because Yale was</v>

28
00:01:26.341 --> 00:01:30.750
<v Speaker 1>one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happened with the Halloween costume</v>

29
00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.670
<v Speaker 1>debacle had gail was one of the first</v>
<v Speaker 1>videos that was released that made</v>

30
00:01:35.671 --> 00:01:39.840
<v Speaker 1>people horrified where they couldn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe how students were communicating</v>

31
00:01:39.841 --> 00:01:41.280
<v Speaker 1>with professors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

32
00:01:41.281 --> 00:01:43.830
<v Speaker 1>Well do a student who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who screamed up a storm about,</v>

33
00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:45.210
<v Speaker 1>about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

34
00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.440
<v Speaker 1>the male professor who was the husband</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the woman who wrote the Pro Halloween</v>

35
00:01:49.441 --> 00:01:51.660
<v Speaker 1>costume letter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it turned out she was on the bloody</v>

36
00:01:51.661 --> 00:01:53.400
<v Speaker 1>hiring committee that hired him.</v>

37
00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.950
<v Speaker 1>One of the things she screamed was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who hired you?</v>

38
00:01:55.951 --> 00:01:56.790
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

39
00:01:56.791 --> 00:02:00.330
<v Speaker 1>it turned out it was you because you</v>
<v Speaker 1>were on the committee just a few years</v>

40
00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.961
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

41
00:02:00.961 --> 00:02:02.670
<v Speaker 1>And they took it like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

42
00:02:02.671 --> 00:02:05.500
<v Speaker 1>that was absolutely in the people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that don't know what the hell we're</v>

43
00:02:05.501 --> 00:02:08.680
<v Speaker 1>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well explained this debacle because it</v>

44
00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.670
<v Speaker 1>really was about questionable Halloween</v>
<v Speaker 1>costumes.</v>

45
00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.000
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was about questioning Halloween</v>

46
00:02:15.001 --> 00:02:17.090
<v Speaker 1>costumes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Halloween costumes are</v>

47
00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.980
<v Speaker 1>part of the whole point of Halloween is</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have questionable costumes,</v>

48
00:02:22.981 --> 00:02:24.840
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You play with death for example,</v>

49
00:02:24.841 --> 00:02:28.200
<v Speaker 1>in decay and and horror and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>

50
00:02:28.201 --> 00:02:33.201
<v Speaker 1>it's a time when the norms with regards</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the expression of things that are</v>

51
00:02:33.541 --> 00:02:38.541
<v Speaker 1>outside of our normal behavior are</v>
<v Speaker 1>suspended so that everybody can can have</v>

52
00:02:38.581 --> 00:02:40.590
<v Speaker 1>a little celebration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As it turns out.</v>

53
00:02:40.591 --> 00:02:41.401
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

54
00:02:41.401 --> 00:02:45.600
<v Speaker 1>campuses have got all upset about things</v>
<v Speaker 1>like cultural appropriation at Queen's</v>

55
00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.110
<v Speaker 1>University in Canada just the other week</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were going after students who were</v>

56
00:02:49.111 --> 00:02:51.810
<v Speaker 1>dressing up as Viet Cong for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or Mexicans.</v>

57
00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.240
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't see what the hell's racist</v>

58
00:02:54.241 --> 00:02:58.710
<v Speaker 1>about dressing up like a Mexican.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mexicans have a traditional traditional</v>

59
00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:59.680
<v Speaker 1>clothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

60
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.180
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing wrong with Mexicans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why is it wrong to dress up like</v>

61
00:03:04.181 --> 00:03:05.890
<v Speaker 1>them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you want to be Puncho via for</v>

62
00:03:05.891 --> 00:03:07.240
<v Speaker 1>Halloween,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's wrong with that?</v>

63
00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.480
<v Speaker 1>A wall will get what you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can regard that as an Omar's just as</v>

64
00:03:10.481 --> 00:03:13.420
<v Speaker 1>much as a denigration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like why is that such a problem?</v>

65
00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:14.590
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But anyways,</v>

66
00:03:14.591 --> 00:03:17.740
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter because nothing's too</v>
<v Speaker 1>trivial to be a problem to a social</v>

67
00:03:17.741 --> 00:03:20.350
<v Speaker 1>justice warrior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And because they don't like to deal with</v>

68
00:03:20.351 --> 00:03:24.160
<v Speaker 1>real problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Yale went after Halloween costs.</v>

69
00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:29.170
<v Speaker 1>So this woman wrote a letter saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe we should just relax about this</v>

70
00:03:29.171 --> 00:03:30.800
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

71
00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:34.090
<v Speaker 1>not don't put restrictions on what</v>
<v Speaker 1>people wear for Halloween,</v>

72
00:03:34.091 --> 00:03:37.000
<v Speaker 1>but let people decide what is and isn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>offensive.</v>

73
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:38.081
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And well,</v>

74
00:03:38.081 --> 00:03:40.930
<v Speaker 1>in many Halloween costumes are</v>
<v Speaker 1>offensive.</v>

75
00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:45.060
<v Speaker 1>That's the point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But her letter was in really reasons.</v>

76
00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:46.780
<v Speaker 1>It was perfectly reasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like an,</v>

77
00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:48.670
<v Speaker 1>it was like an adult wrote it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

78
00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:49.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

79
00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:51.070
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all hell broke loose,</v>

80
00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:52.390
<v Speaker 1>all hell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she ended up,</v>

81
00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.090
<v Speaker 1>she ended up quitting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think he did it.</v>

82
00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.871
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think,</v>

83
00:03:55.871 --> 00:03:57.700
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he left,</v>

84
00:03:57.701 --> 00:04:01.340
<v Speaker 1>but she did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seeing him bow down to this woman's</v>

85
00:04:01.341 --> 00:04:05.620
<v Speaker 1>screaming at him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>swearing in his face was so disturbing.</v>

86
00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:10.150
<v Speaker 1>It was so humiliating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt so humiliated for him cause she</v>

87
00:04:10.151 --> 00:04:12.160
<v Speaker 1>was screaming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is our home.</v>

88
00:04:12.161 --> 00:04:15.670
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not making a safe home.</v>

89
00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:18.640
<v Speaker 1>The university's not a home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a safe space.</v>

90
00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:21.820
<v Speaker 1>It's not a secure space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>None of that.</v>

91
00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:22.451
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if,</v>

92
00:04:22.451 --> 00:04:27.451
<v Speaker 1>if it that when they get</v>
<v Speaker 1>a university isn't a home,</v>

93
00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:29.080
<v Speaker 1>that's not what it is.</v>

94
00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:33.460
<v Speaker 1>It's a place to be confronted by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say often horrible ideas.</v>

95
00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:36.250
<v Speaker 1>You want to learn about history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think that's going to be safe.</v>

96
00:04:36.251 --> 00:04:39.970
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what human history is like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an endless blood bath with,</v>

97
00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:40.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

98
00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:44.320
<v Speaker 1>with a certain amount of a hopeful</v>
<v Speaker 1>progress underlying it.</v>

99
00:04:44.321 --> 00:04:44.801
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

100
00:04:44.801 --> 00:04:47.500
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a horror show and great literature</v>

101
00:04:47.501 --> 00:04:48.370
<v Speaker 1>is like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

102
00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:51.670
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and biology is terrifying and physics is</v>

103
00:04:51.671 --> 00:04:55.090
<v Speaker 1>terrifying and you want to be safe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's stay home.</v>

104
00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.640
<v Speaker 1>Stay home with your mom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stay home with your dad.</v>

105
00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:59.860
<v Speaker 1>Don't come to university if you want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be safe,</v>

106
00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.200
<v Speaker 1>because anything you do outside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one of the,</v>

107
00:05:02.201 --> 00:05:03.520
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're going,</v>

108
00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:07.900
<v Speaker 1>if the university is going to make you</v>
<v Speaker 1>safe than it ceased to be a university.</v>

109
00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.360
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things I tried to do in my</v>
<v Speaker 1>class,</v>

110
00:05:10.361 --> 00:05:12.040
<v Speaker 1>I have this class called maps of</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning,</v>

111
00:05:12.041 --> 00:05:16.500
<v Speaker 1>which concentrates on atrocity basically</v>
<v Speaker 1>on Soviet atrocity and,</v>

112
00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.700
<v Speaker 1>and Nazi atrocity mostly.</v>

113
00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:23.230
<v Speaker 1>And what I tried to do in the class is</v>
<v Speaker 1>to teach my students that had they been</v>

114
00:05:23.231 --> 00:05:27.310
<v Speaker 1>in Nazi Germany in the 1930s,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would've been Nazis and had they</v>

115
00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:29.920
<v Speaker 1>been offered the opportunity to be in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Auschwitz,</v>

116
00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:31.270
<v Speaker 1>Auschwitz,</v>
<v Speaker 1>camp guard,</v>

117
00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:34.090
<v Speaker 1>then maybe they would have leapt at it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe they would have been in the</v>

118
00:05:34.091 --> 00:05:35.290
<v Speaker 1>sadistic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

119
00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:39.490
<v Speaker 1>in the more sadistic proportion of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Auschwitz camp guard population.</v>

120
00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:43.690
<v Speaker 1>You think that makes you feel safe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make you feel safe to know</v>

121
00:05:43.691 --> 00:05:46.360
<v Speaker 1>that Nazis were humans and you happen to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be one of them.</v>

122
00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:51.010
<v Speaker 1>And so I think that educators that tell</v>
<v Speaker 1>students that they're offering them a</v>

123
00:05:51.011 --> 00:05:54.010
<v Speaker 1>safe space are doing them a profound</v>
<v Speaker 1>disservice.</v>

124
00:05:54.011 --> 00:05:57.190
<v Speaker 1>And you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a clinical psychologist.</v>

125
00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:00.410
<v Speaker 1>Here's one of the things you do to make</v>
<v Speaker 1>people less afraid.</v>

126
00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:06.370
<v Speaker 1>You don't make the world safer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you do is you people tell you what</v>

127
00:06:07.371 --> 00:06:10.520
<v Speaker 1>they're afraid of and then you break it</v>
<v Speaker 1>into little bits so that they can go</v>

128
00:06:10.521 --> 00:06:11.354
<v Speaker 1>confront them.</v>

129
00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:13.100
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So maybe they were afraid of going to a</v>

130
00:06:13.101 --> 00:06:15.050
<v Speaker 1>party and you break that down and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

131
00:06:15.051 --> 00:06:16.550
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you know how to introduce yourself?</v>

132
00:06:16.551 --> 00:06:16.941
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

133
00:06:16.941 --> 00:06:18.260
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't really even know how to shake</v>

134
00:06:18.261 --> 00:06:20.750
<v Speaker 1>someone's hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then you practice having them</v>

135
00:06:20.751 --> 00:06:23.330
<v Speaker 1>shake their hand and introduce</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves because maybe they weren't</v>

136
00:06:23.331 --> 00:06:26.000
<v Speaker 1>taught by that by their halfway did</v>
<v Speaker 1>parents when they were,</v>

137
00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.310
<v Speaker 1>when they were young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they were ignored.</v>

138
00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:29.571
<v Speaker 1>And so then you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

139
00:06:29.571 --> 00:06:32.390
<v Speaker 1>maybe you can go to a party for half an</v>
<v Speaker 1>hour and all you have to do is introduce</v>

140
00:06:32.391 --> 00:06:34.820
<v Speaker 1>yourself to two people and then we'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>call that success.</v>

141
00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:38.810
<v Speaker 1>And you build up their competence and</v>
<v Speaker 1>their confidence one step at a time.</v>

142
00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:43.040
<v Speaker 1>And what happens to the clinical</v>
<v Speaker 1>literature indicates quite clearly is</v>

143
00:06:43.041 --> 00:06:45.200
<v Speaker 1>you don't make people less anxious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By doing that.</v>

144
00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:46.880
<v Speaker 1>You make them braver.</v>

145
00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:52.280
<v Speaker 1>It's not the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't make the world and its horrors</v>

146
00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:55.180
<v Speaker 1>smaller.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You make the person and their their</v>

147
00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:58.700
<v Speaker 1>their capacity to deal with horror</v>
<v Speaker 1>larger.</v>

148
00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:01.280
<v Speaker 1>You encourage them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you strengthen them.</v>

149
00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:04.850
<v Speaker 1>That's what you do at a university.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You arm people with arguments,</v>

150
00:07:04.851 --> 00:07:06.380
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you hone their intellect,</v>

151
00:07:06.381 --> 00:07:08.480
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you help them learn to write so they can</v>

152
00:07:08.481 --> 00:07:09.610
<v Speaker 1>marshal their arguments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

153
00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:13.760
<v Speaker 1>you'll help them learn how to engage in</v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectual combat because that's</v>

154
00:07:13.761 --> 00:07:16.760
<v Speaker 1>better than engaging in real combat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you make them,</v>

155
00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:21.560
<v Speaker 1>you make them hard and strong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't mollycoddle them and make them</v>

156
00:07:21.561 --> 00:07:25.190
<v Speaker 1>safe unless you're their enemy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you're trying to devour their</v>

157
00:07:25.191 --> 00:07:28.040
<v Speaker 1>spirit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what we have in the</v>

158
00:07:28.041 --> 00:07:29.120
<v Speaker 1>universities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have,</v>

159
00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:32.030
<v Speaker 1>we have the reign of the depaul mother</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's,</v>

160
00:07:32.031 --> 00:07:35.000
<v Speaker 1>who's answered everything is all just</v>
<v Speaker 1>come a little closer deer and all</v>

161
00:07:35.001 --> 00:07:38.000
<v Speaker 1>protect you from the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just like Hansel and Gretel,</v>

162
00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:39.291
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

163
00:07:39.291 --> 00:07:39.980
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

164
00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:41.900
<v Speaker 1>the which in the Hansel and Gretel</v>
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>

165
00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:45.020
<v Speaker 1>Well my house is made of gingerbread.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just come in here and everything will be</v>

166
00:07:45.021 --> 00:07:48.080
<v Speaker 1>fine while she feeds you candy to fatten</v>
<v Speaker 1>you up so she can eat you.</v>

167
00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:50.780
<v Speaker 1>That's the archetype of a modern</v>
<v Speaker 1>university.</v>

168
00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:58.440
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>
