1
00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:02.220
<v Speaker 1>Here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Five,</v>

2
00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:04.890
<v Speaker 1>four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

3
00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:06.600
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

4
00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.050
<v Speaker 1>David,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>

5
00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:10.590
<v Speaker 1>how are you sir?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great,</v>

6
00:00:10.591 --> 00:00:11.640
<v Speaker 1>thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for being here man.</v>

7
00:00:11.641 --> 00:00:13.220
<v Speaker 1>I appreciate it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for having me on.</v>

8
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm really looking forward to talking to</v>
<v Speaker 1>you very much so.</v>

9
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.110
<v Speaker 1>This is a fascinating subject for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anti aging.</v>

10
00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:24.810
<v Speaker 1>The idea that you'll be able to stop</v>
<v Speaker 1>aging or even possibly pull it back or</v>

11
00:00:24.811 --> 00:00:27.840
<v Speaker 1>if they're very least slowed down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think?</v>

12
00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.500
<v Speaker 1>I think that's all on the table.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've been doing this for years in the</v>

13
00:00:31.501 --> 00:00:33.090
<v Speaker 1>lab.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we've just got to figure out how to</v>

14
00:00:33.091 --> 00:00:35.190
<v Speaker 1>do it in people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I talk to someone like you as an</v>

15
00:00:35.191 --> 00:00:36.960
<v Speaker 1>actual research scientists to this</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>

16
00:00:36.961 --> 00:00:39.180
<v Speaker 1>I always want to know what are you doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>to yourself?</v>

17
00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.950
<v Speaker 1>How long have you got?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what do you do a daily basis?</v>

18
00:00:43.951 --> 00:00:45.810
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you 100 years old?</v>

19
00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:47.130
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting there.</v>

20
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.380
<v Speaker 1>How old are you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>20.</v>

21
00:00:48.381 --> 00:00:51.030
<v Speaker 1>50.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're turning 50 and I wouldn't</v>

22
00:00:51.031 --> 00:00:54.150
<v Speaker 1>have thought you were 50,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have figured you were for about</v>

23
00:00:54.151 --> 00:00:55.620
<v Speaker 1>41.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Forty two.</v>

24
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.960
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of you.</v>

25
00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.340
<v Speaker 1>One of my brothers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the negative control and he's,</v>

26
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.440
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does he look like shit?</v>

27
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:02.640
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't say that,</v>

28
00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.570
<v Speaker 1>but people say that he doesn't look as</v>
<v Speaker 1>young as me and he's about three and a</v>

29
00:01:06.571 --> 00:01:09.570
<v Speaker 1>half years younger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what are you doing personally?</v>

30
00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:11.303
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

31
00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of the time I'm in the lab and</v>

32
00:01:13.111 --> 00:01:16.410
<v Speaker 1>trying to run a bunch of companies to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make these drugs are reality.</v>

33
00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.410
<v Speaker 1>But daily I try to keep a healthy</v>
<v Speaker 1>weight.</v>

34
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.250
<v Speaker 1>I do intermittent fasting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is pretty easy because I'm so</v>

35
00:01:23.251 --> 00:01:24.240
<v Speaker 1>busy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget to eat.</v>

36
00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.910
<v Speaker 1>How many hours do you give yourself</v>
<v Speaker 1>every night?</v>

37
00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.340
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I suffer from a late night</v>

38
00:01:29.341 --> 00:01:31.050
<v Speaker 1>snacking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I try to skip breakfast,</v>

39
00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:32.880
<v Speaker 1>skip lunch if I'm busy.</v>

40
00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.870
<v Speaker 1>So I'm a night eater,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that seemed to be good because a</v>

41
00:01:36.871 --> 00:01:38.400
<v Speaker 1>study came out about a couple of weeks</v>
<v Speaker 1>ago,</v>

42
00:01:38.401 --> 00:01:40.410
<v Speaker 1>at least in mice that it's not what you</v>
<v Speaker 1>eat,</v>

43
00:01:40.411 --> 00:01:42.630
<v Speaker 1>it's when you eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's most important for longevity</v>

44
00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.440
<v Speaker 1>really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when,</v>

45
00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.850
<v Speaker 1>when being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when like what's,</v>

46
00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.840
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't actually matter if you eat a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot in the morning or a lot at night.</v>

47
00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.130
<v Speaker 1>I like nighttime eating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you need a period during the day at</v>

48
00:01:56.131 --> 00:01:58.050
<v Speaker 1>least if you're a mouse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably if you're a human where you're</v>

49
00:01:58.051 --> 00:01:59.190
<v Speaker 1>hungry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

50
00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.190
<v Speaker 1>and that puts your body in a defensive</v>
<v Speaker 1>mode and these are the things that we've</v>

51
00:02:02.191 --> 00:02:04.020
<v Speaker 1>been studying in my lab for the last 20</v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

52
00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.850
<v Speaker 1>What are the processes that died and</v>
<v Speaker 1>exercise do for us?</v>

53
00:02:08.851 --> 00:02:12.270
<v Speaker 1>They keep us healthy and why does</v>
<v Speaker 1>calorie restriction and intermittent</v>

54
00:02:12.271 --> 00:02:16.380
<v Speaker 1>fasting make animals live so much longer</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we think we figured out a large part</v>

55
00:02:16.381 --> 00:02:19.260
<v Speaker 1>of how that works and now we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>mimicking that with molecules.</v>

56
00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.690
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the,</v>

57
00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.640
<v Speaker 1>is the idea that you can mimic it with</v>
<v Speaker 1>molecules and it will be as effective as</v>

58
00:02:26.641 --> 00:02:29.880
<v Speaker 1>intermittent fasting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the molecules will be better.</v>

59
00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.230
<v Speaker 1>And not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we add them onto a healthy diet and</v>

60
00:02:34.231 --> 00:02:36.240
<v Speaker 1>exercise and the animals they do even</v>
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>

61
00:02:36.241 --> 00:02:39.840
<v Speaker 1>It's like a supercharged mouse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now when you add them onto the mice,</v>

62
00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.360
<v Speaker 1>do you also add them on with</v>
<v Speaker 1>intermittent fasting?</v>

63
00:02:42.361 --> 00:02:44.380
<v Speaker 1>And is there an additional benefit?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

64
00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:45.390
<v Speaker 1>we do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We do.</v>

65
00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.010
<v Speaker 1>One of the first molecules that infants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>molecules that we are known for is</v>

66
00:02:50.011 --> 00:02:53.160
<v Speaker 1>resveratrol from red wine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That molecule discovered it in my</v>

67
00:02:53.161 --> 00:02:54.870
<v Speaker 1>thirties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or at least linked it to aging.</v>

68
00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.230
<v Speaker 1>What we showed was that if you give it</v>
<v Speaker 1>to a fat mouse,</v>

69
00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:59.740
<v Speaker 1>there was healthy as a thin mouse.</v>

70
00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.620
<v Speaker 2>They live just as long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't get heart disease and all of</v>

71
00:03:02.621 --> 00:03:05.290
<v Speaker 2>the other bad stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then what we did was interesting.</v>

72
00:03:05.291 --> 00:03:10.291
<v Speaker 2>We gave it to the mice either every day</v>
<v Speaker 2>in their food or let them skip a meal</v>

73
00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.610
<v Speaker 2>every day so that they were fed every</v>
<v Speaker 2>other day.</v>

74
00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.120
<v Speaker 2>And that combination of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as virtual plus every other day feeding,</v>

75
00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.970
<v Speaker 2>we had the longest lifespan we'd ever</v>
<v Speaker 2>seen.</v>

76
00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.230
<v Speaker 2>And it was so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was additive.</v>

77
00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.980
<v Speaker 2>Same with exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we give our latest molecule called</v>

78
00:03:23.981 --> 00:03:25.170
<v Speaker 2>Ada men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

79
00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.680
<v Speaker 2>to a mouse and we exercise it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'll run even further than it could</v>

80
00:03:29.681 --> 00:03:33.070
<v Speaker 2>with either of those alone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's not an excuse to sit around and</v>

81
00:03:33.071 --> 00:03:37.510
<v Speaker 2>just eat chips and watch TV.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It augments healthy lifestyle,</v>

82
00:03:37.511 --> 00:03:39.460
<v Speaker 2>get you further than what you could get</v>
<v Speaker 2>naturally.</v>

83
00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:44.200
<v Speaker 2>So in any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you seeing a benefit in addition?</v>

84
00:03:44.201 --> 00:03:46.480
<v Speaker 2>So is the idea to compound all those</v>
<v Speaker 2>things together?</v>

85
00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:47.860
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

86
00:03:47.861 --> 00:03:49.420
<v Speaker 2>So you asked about myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>

87
00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.820
<v Speaker 2>I do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I eat healthy,</v>

88
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.560
<v Speaker 2>I try to skip meals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I also take supplements and in fact most</v>

89
00:03:56.561 --> 00:04:00.640
<v Speaker 2>of my colleagues are in the field of</v>
<v Speaker 2>aging or anti aging us as people call it</v>

90
00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.070
<v Speaker 2>a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I take nmn every morning.</v>

91
00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:04.450
<v Speaker 2>What is an m,</v>
<v Speaker 2>n?</v>

92
00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.490
<v Speaker 2>Good question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let me take a quick step back.</v>

93
00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.630
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so about 20 years ago a Lenny Guarente</v>

94
00:04:10.631 --> 00:04:14.850
<v Speaker 2>and a team of us at mit discovered a set</v>
<v Speaker 2>of genes that control aging in yeast</v>

95
00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.720
<v Speaker 2>cells,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just bruise east,</v>

96
00:04:16.721 --> 00:04:20.740
<v Speaker 2>what you find in beer and bread.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And those genes are called Sirtuin.</v>

97
00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:22.480
<v Speaker 2>And there are seven of them in our</v>
<v Speaker 2>bodies,</v>

98
00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.050
<v Speaker 2>five and yeast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what they do is they protect all</v>

99
00:04:26.051 --> 00:04:27.700
<v Speaker 2>organisms on the planet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>plants,</v>

100
00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:31.810
<v Speaker 2>bacteria,</v>
<v Speaker 2>humans from deterioration and disease.</v>

101
00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.690
<v Speaker 2>They're like the Pentagon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They sense when we're hungry since when</v>

102
00:04:34.691 --> 00:04:37.360
<v Speaker 2>we're exercising and they send out the</v>
<v Speaker 2>troops to defend us.</v>

103
00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:39.950
<v Speaker 2>So when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you put more of these genes into a</v>

104
00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:44.260
<v Speaker 2>reseller or a mouse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll live longer between five to 20</v>

105
00:04:44.261 --> 00:04:46.930
<v Speaker 2>percent longer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we think that these genes are</v>

106
00:04:46.931 --> 00:04:49.510
<v Speaker 2>responsible for the effects of dieting</v>
<v Speaker 2>and exercise,</v>

107
00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.680
<v Speaker 2>which is great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which what that means is we can now</v>

108
00:04:51.681 --> 00:04:54.670
<v Speaker 2>mimic that with molecules.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So nmn is one of those molecules.</v>

109
00:04:54.671 --> 00:04:58.300
<v Speaker 2>So Israel is virtual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can think of where as virtual as the</v>

110
00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.210
<v Speaker 2>accelerator pedal for the Sirtuin genes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the sentiment is the,</v>

111
00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.850
<v Speaker 2>is the fuel and without fuel reserve</v>
<v Speaker 2>virtual weren't works.</v>

112
00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.250
<v Speaker 2>Nmn is the gas in the car I've heard of</v>
<v Speaker 2>resveratrol.</v>

113
00:05:09.251 --> 00:05:12.280
<v Speaker 2>But as Nmn and new molecules is</v>
<v Speaker 2>commercially available,</v>

114
00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:17.730
<v Speaker 2>some people started selling it on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Internet as it related to an R,</v>

115
00:05:19.151 --> 00:05:22.960
<v Speaker 2>which is sold by a bunch of companies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And our year nicotine,</v>

116
00:05:22.961 --> 00:05:27.310
<v Speaker 2>my driver's side is a supplement that</v>
<v Speaker 2>raises the levels of a molecule called</v>

117
00:05:27.311 --> 00:05:29.380
<v Speaker 2>Nad feel like I should make a shopping</v>
<v Speaker 2>list.</v>

118
00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.940
<v Speaker 2>So they get up here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what are you writing that down to</v>

119
00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:35.940
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the Sirtuins okay,</v>

120
00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:41.280
<v Speaker 2>get this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So sauternes need nad to work without</v>

121
00:05:42.041 --> 00:05:42.874
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

122
00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:43.751
<v Speaker 2>they're at work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

123
00:05:43.751 --> 00:05:46.420
<v Speaker 2>if you don't have an ID in your body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd be dead in about 30 seconds.</v>

124
00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:48.700
<v Speaker 2>It's a really important molecule.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But as we get older,</v>

125
00:05:48.701 --> 00:05:51.070
<v Speaker 2>we lose nad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So by the time you're 50,</v>

126
00:05:51.071 --> 00:05:54.040
<v Speaker 2>like I almost am,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have about the half the levels of</v>

127
00:05:54.041 --> 00:05:56.950
<v Speaker 2>once or you had when you were 20.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's not.</v>

128
00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:01.250
<v Speaker 2>And these are two ends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't protect the body without high</v>

129
00:06:01.251 --> 00:06:04.790
<v Speaker 2>levels of Nad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what Nmn does and this other molecule</v>

130
00:06:04.791 --> 00:06:06.890
<v Speaker 2>called nr,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which both you can get on the Internet,</v>

131
00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:11.510
<v Speaker 2>they boost the body's levels of Nad</v>
<v Speaker 2>backup to youthful levels again,</v>

132
00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:16.750
<v Speaker 2>and if we give them to mice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these molecules t two mice Orient Worms</v>

133
00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:18.920
<v Speaker 2>or yeast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they live longer and they're super</v>

134
00:06:18.921 --> 00:06:19.754
<v Speaker 2>healthy.</v>

135
00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:22.400
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what level or how many milligrams are</v>

136
00:06:22.401 --> 00:06:24.290
<v Speaker 2>you taking of these things?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

137
00:06:24.291 --> 00:06:25.820
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a man is,</v>

138
00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:28.820
<v Speaker 2>is um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something I get from,</v>

139
00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:31.100
<v Speaker 2>for myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not selling anything.</v>

140
00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:34.630
<v Speaker 2>So I take a gram of vitamin in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>morning based on clinical trials has</v>

141
00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:37.220
<v Speaker 2>been shown that that will raise nad with</v>
<v Speaker 2>or without food.</v>

142
00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:39.500
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I take a little bit of yogurt that I</v>

143
00:06:39.501 --> 00:06:43.310
<v Speaker 2>make myself at home just to see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

144
00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.170
<v Speaker 2>you have been doing this for a while.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

145
00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:47.300
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I only started doing stuff when I say</v>

146
00:06:47.301 --> 00:06:49.250
<v Speaker 2>work in animals first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So take,</v>

147
00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:53.330
<v Speaker 2>take the yogurt mix in some ers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Virtual research role is great,</v>

148
00:06:53.331 --> 00:06:55.400
<v Speaker 2>but it's really insoluble.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like brick dust.</v>

149
00:06:55.790 --> 00:07:00.030
<v Speaker 2>So in the yoga it'll dissolve.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Take another half a gram of reserve and</v>

150
00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:01.460
<v Speaker 2>how much?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A half a gram.</v>

151
00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:02.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

152
00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:03.860
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a powder.</v>

153
00:07:03.861 --> 00:07:06.710
<v Speaker 2>I have a few kilos leftover from</v>
<v Speaker 2>clinical trials in my basement.</v>

154
00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:10.550
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's going to last me a few decades.</v>

155
00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:12.730
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I also take at night some</v>

156
00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:15.470
<v Speaker 2>metformin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is probably the most radical thing</v>

157
00:07:15.471 --> 00:07:18.770
<v Speaker 2>that I take,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a prescribed drug for diabetes.</v>

158
00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:21.390
<v Speaker 2>Metformin met,</v>
<v Speaker 2>met him,</v>

159
00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:25.270
<v Speaker 2>met and prescribable drug.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you,</v>

160
00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:27.200
<v Speaker 2>but you don't have diabetes?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do not.</v>

161
00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:32.300
<v Speaker 2>But you take it for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for preventing cancer,</v>

162
00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:34.900
<v Speaker 2>heart disease,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alzheimer's and aging met.</v>

163
00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:38.120
<v Speaker 2>Can you spell it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Met F o r m I n</v>

164
00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:43.880
<v Speaker 2>N.</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so studies have 10,000 people and</v>

165
00:07:43.881 --> 00:07:45.890
<v Speaker 2>more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's been shown that people who take</v>

166
00:07:45.891 --> 00:07:49.670
<v Speaker 2>metformin and even if they have diabetes</v>
<v Speaker 2>are protected against other diseases of</v>

167
00:07:49.671 --> 00:07:50.660
<v Speaker 2>aging,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even frailty.</v>

168
00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:53.360
<v Speaker 2>And so most scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you ask them in my field,</v>

169
00:07:53.361 --> 00:07:55.430
<v Speaker 2>will say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>metformin is likely to extend your</v>

170
00:07:55.431 --> 00:07:58.130
<v Speaker 2>lifespan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just that the FDA doesn't let you</v>

171
00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:01.850
<v Speaker 2>have it for aging because aging isn't a</v>
<v Speaker 2>disease yet.</v>

172
00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:06.650
<v Speaker 2>So do you have to get diabetes to get it</v>
<v Speaker 2>or do you have to get a sneaky doctor?</v>

173
00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:08.060
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't call it sneaky doctor,</v>

174
00:08:08.061 --> 00:08:10.700
<v Speaker 2>but the doctor typically has to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>convinced because they don't keep up</v>

175
00:08:10.701 --> 00:08:13.730
<v Speaker 2>with the literature and it's off label.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

176
00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:15.230
<v Speaker 2>alright.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And how much do you take of that?</v>

177
00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:17.930
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I take a gram of that as well,</v>

178
00:08:17.931 --> 00:08:20.990
<v Speaker 2>which is about a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a low dose as some diabetics type two</v>

179
00:08:20.991 --> 00:08:22.400
<v Speaker 2>grams.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's not crazy amounts.</v>

180
00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:24.110
<v Speaker 2>Is there any side effects?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

181
00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:28.610
<v Speaker 2>the good news is that it's extremely</v>
<v Speaker 2>rare that you get sick from any of these</v>

182
00:08:28.611 --> 00:08:31.250
<v Speaker 2>molecules.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in millions of patients around the</v>

183
00:08:31.251 --> 00:08:33.620
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody's getting sick.</v>

184
00:08:33.621 --> 00:08:37.220
<v Speaker 2>The worst you'll have as far as I can</v>
<v Speaker 2>tell is a stomach upset.</v>

185
00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:39.560
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I get that which is actually helpful</v>

186
00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:42.800
<v Speaker 2>if I'm hungry or I lose my appetite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

187
00:08:42.801 --> 00:08:46.040
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the downside is extremely low</v>

188
00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:47.510
<v Speaker 2>and that the upside is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

189
00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:52.900
<v Speaker 2>anything's better than what's coming and</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is the mechanism that metformin is</v>

190
00:08:53.061 --> 00:08:53.894
<v Speaker 2>operating.</v>

191
00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:56.910
<v Speaker 2>So that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this is the great thing is that over</v>

192
00:08:56.911 --> 00:09:00.420
<v Speaker 2>the last 20 years we have figured out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we scientists have figured out that</v>

193
00:09:00.421 --> 00:09:04.790
<v Speaker 2>there are universal regulators of aging</v>
<v Speaker 2>from yeast to worms to mice and in</v>

194
00:09:04.791 --> 00:09:06.990
<v Speaker 2>treatments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there were three main pathways that</v>

195
00:09:06.991 --> 00:09:08.820
<v Speaker 2>we figured out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>respond to what we eat,</v>

196
00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:13.660
<v Speaker 2>how we exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of them is called amp k a.</v>

197
00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:15.240
<v Speaker 2>and this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a target,</v>

198
00:09:15.241 --> 00:09:17.370
<v Speaker 2>metformin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I'm active.</v>

199
00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:19.650
<v Speaker 2>When I take Metformin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm activating my amp K,</v>

200
00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:23.700
<v Speaker 2>which we'll send out the troops,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Sir two ones I've mentioned.</v>

201
00:09:23.701 --> 00:09:28.170
<v Speaker 2>That's the second of the pathways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I take enemen and residual for</v>

202
00:09:28.171 --> 00:09:30.540
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then third one is called</v>

203
00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:33.540
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a pathway in the body that</v>

204
00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:36.060
<v Speaker 2>responds to how many amino acids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much meat you're eating.</v>

205
00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:41.460
<v Speaker 2>And it will also protect the body if you</v>
<v Speaker 2>tweak it just the right way.</v>

206
00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:45.390
<v Speaker 2>And as only besides eating low amounts</v>
<v Speaker 2>of protein,</v>

207
00:09:45.391 --> 00:09:48.060
<v Speaker 2>the only way to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to affect that pathways with a drug</v>

208
00:09:48.061 --> 00:09:50.100
<v Speaker 2>called Rapamycin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

209
00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:55.280
<v Speaker 2>which is a little dangerous to try and</v>
<v Speaker 2>is used for a immunosuppressant.</v>

210
00:09:55.290 --> 00:10:00.290
<v Speaker 2>So it's not something that I would</v>
<v Speaker 2>recommend a and I don't take it.</v>

211
00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:06.350
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is your daily routine along with</v>

212
00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:08.810
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what kind of Diet do you follow?</v>

213
00:10:09.770 --> 00:10:10.510
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

214
00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:14.030
<v Speaker 2>I try to not eat too much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty easy to overeat.</v>

215
00:10:14.031 --> 00:10:15.950
<v Speaker 2>So I'd try to skip one or two meals a</v>
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>

216
00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:19.910
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I avoid sugars and carbs.</v>

217
00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:25.070
<v Speaker 2>I try to run once a week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do workouts on the weekend.</v>

218
00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:26.420
<v Speaker 2>Like you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

219
00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:28.640
<v Speaker 2>I love Saunas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like to put my body in some</v>

220
00:10:28.641 --> 00:10:30.140
<v Speaker 2>temperature stress.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go hate.</v>

221
00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:32.630
<v Speaker 2>And then I jumped in a cold bath back</v>
<v Speaker 2>and forth that,</v>

222
00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:36.530
<v Speaker 2>that works well for yeast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can do that in lab and they live 30</v>

223
00:10:36.531 --> 00:10:37.430
<v Speaker 2>percent longer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

224
00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:40.263
<v Speaker 2>there's all that.</v>

225
00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:42.860
<v Speaker 3>Do you have to try generally?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I normally.</v>

226
00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:45.440
<v Speaker 3>Do you ever try going from Sauna to</v>
<v Speaker 3>cryotherapy?</v>

227
00:10:46.090 --> 00:10:46.790
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

228
00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:48.570
<v Speaker 3>I haven't tried actual cryotherapy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just a.</v>

229
00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:50.620
<v Speaker 3>You haven't done it at all?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

230
00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:52.100
<v Speaker 3>You want to do it today?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

231
00:10:52.101 --> 00:10:52.761
<v Speaker 3>If he got one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

232
00:10:52.761 --> 00:10:53.720
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll take you.</v>

233
00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:56.840
<v Speaker 3>Take you down the street.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a great one because it's,</v>

234
00:10:57.170 --> 00:11:00.080
<v Speaker 3>there's different kinds and some of them</v>
<v Speaker 3>are from the neck down.</v>

235
00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:02.810
<v Speaker 3>Were they using liquid nitrogen?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The other ones,</v>

236
00:11:02.811 --> 00:11:06.410
<v Speaker 3>they actually freeze the air.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when they're using the nitrogen to</v>

237
00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:10.730
<v Speaker 3>freeze the air and they're pumping in</v>
<v Speaker 3>air that's 240 degrees below zero and</v>

238
00:11:10.731 --> 00:11:11.240
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

239
00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:14.840
<v Speaker 3>you're going to do about two minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do three because I do it all the time,</v>

240
00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:16.460
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's awesome.</v>

241
00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:19.220
<v Speaker 3>I do three and then I take 10 minutes</v>
<v Speaker 3>off and then I go back in for another</v>

242
00:11:19.221 --> 00:11:20.054
<v Speaker 3>three.</v>

243
00:11:20.510 --> 00:11:21.111
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>makes sense.</v>

244
00:11:21.111 --> 00:11:22.640
<v Speaker 2>And what you're doing to your body when</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do that,</v>

245
00:11:22.641 --> 00:11:26.510
<v Speaker 2>we think is to activate these longevity</v>
<v Speaker 2>pathways like this or two ends.</v>

246
00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:27.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

247
00:11:27.801 --> 00:11:30.470
<v Speaker 2>and that's really the trick is to</v>
<v Speaker 2>activate your body's defenses against</v>

248
00:11:30.471 --> 00:11:32.020
<v Speaker 2>aging.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

249
00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:34.040
<v Speaker 2>the old theories about aging,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to throw them out.</v>

250
00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:36.200
<v Speaker 2>Most people at parties will tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

251
00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:38.090
<v Speaker 2>antioxidants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>free radicals,</v>

252
00:11:38.091 --> 00:11:43.010
<v Speaker 2>DNA damage or mutations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is all for the most part,</v>

253
00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:44.023
<v Speaker 2>incorrect</v>

254
00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:47.690
<v Speaker 3>that antioxidants cause DNA damage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

255
00:11:47.691 --> 00:11:50.360
<v Speaker 3>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That it repairs DNA damage.</v>

256
00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:53.740
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>intoxicants had been a rather big in the</v>

257
00:11:53.741 --> 00:11:54.130
<v Speaker 3>aging</v>

258
00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:56.230
<v Speaker 2>field,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but resveratrol and antioxidant,</v>

259
00:11:56.231 --> 00:11:57.130
<v Speaker 2>correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

260
00:11:57.131 --> 00:12:00.080
<v Speaker 2>it's a mild antioxidant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't work by being an intox.</v>

261
00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:01.750
<v Speaker 2>What does it work?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is the pathway?</v>

262
00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:04.810
<v Speaker 2>It steps on the accelerator pedal of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sirtuin enzymes.</v>

263
00:12:05.730 --> 00:12:08.160
<v Speaker 2>And so it's directly controlling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

264
00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:11.590
<v Speaker 2>the body's defenses against aging.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So as we discussed it,</v>

265
00:12:11.591 --> 00:12:13.870
<v Speaker 2>or as people discussed it as an</v>
<v Speaker 2>antioxidant,</v>

266
00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:16.880
<v Speaker 2>it was just a mom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a mild form of antibiotics,</v>

267
00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:18.610
<v Speaker 2>an antioxidant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it didn't so much more.</v>

268
00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:21.460
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we know this because if you create a</v>

269
00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:26.350
<v Speaker 2>yeast cell or a worm or a mouse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you knock out the gene for the</v>

270
00:12:26.351 --> 00:12:29.110
<v Speaker 2>Sirtuin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now reversal doesn't help the animal</v>

271
00:12:29.111 --> 00:12:30.730
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting because when people</v>

272
00:12:30.731 --> 00:12:32.740
<v Speaker 2>talk about wine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the one thing they say.</v>

273
00:12:32.741 --> 00:12:35.170
<v Speaker 2>There is very Charles and antioxidants</v>
<v Speaker 2>really good for you.</v>

274
00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:37.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is one of those urban myths that</v>

275
00:12:37.091 --> 00:12:39.670
<v Speaker 2>never goes away and still fuels a</v>
<v Speaker 2>billion dollar industry.</v>

276
00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:42.740
<v Speaker 2>But what we're finding is that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>molecules in plants like where's</v>

277
00:12:42.741 --> 00:12:45.100
<v Speaker 2>virtual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all that we think that produced</v>

278
00:12:45.101 --> 00:12:47.260
<v Speaker 2>by plants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because the plants are benefiting from</v>

279
00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:49.900
<v Speaker 2>the stress,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we call it Hormesis,</v>

280
00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:52.060
<v Speaker 2>a little bit of stress is good for you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what doesn't kill you,</v>

281
00:12:52.061 --> 00:12:57.061
<v Speaker 2>makes you stronger kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Hermes was discovered about 60,</v>

282
00:12:57.641 --> 00:13:01.570
<v Speaker 2>70 years ago when people were spraying</v>
<v Speaker 2>herbicides on plants and a little bit of</v>

283
00:13:01.571 --> 00:13:05.210
<v Speaker 2>herbicide actually made them stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we think that these molecules in</v>

284
00:13:05.211 --> 00:13:07.840
<v Speaker 2>plants are similar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They make the plant stronger during</v>

285
00:13:07.841 --> 00:13:11.200
<v Speaker 2>times of stress.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you stress a grape that's for</v>

286
00:13:11.210 --> 00:13:14.050
<v Speaker 2>winemaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll get great wine,</v>

287
00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:18.100
<v Speaker 2>but you also get a lot of resveratrol.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so when we ingest that resveratrol</v>

288
00:13:18.101 --> 00:13:21.580
<v Speaker 2>from the clients,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we get the same health benefits because</v>

289
00:13:21.581 --> 00:13:24.570
<v Speaker 2>the plants are activating their</v>
<v Speaker 2>serotonin pathways and we have the</v>

290
00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:26.290
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] and they activate us as</v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

291
00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:28.090
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting.</v>

292
00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:30.850
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So low carb,</v>

293
00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:32.570
<v Speaker 2>low sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

294
00:13:32.590 --> 00:13:36.100
<v Speaker 2>any specific type of protein?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you limit your amount of protein?</v>

295
00:13:36.730 --> 00:13:39.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I enjoy eating memos just as much</v>

296
00:13:39.581 --> 00:13:40.400
<v Speaker 2>as anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

297
00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:43.660
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I try to avoid them for the main,</v>

298
00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:45.220
<v Speaker 2>were two main reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One is that,</v>

299
00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:48.310
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this tmao molecule that seems to</v>

300
00:13:48.430 --> 00:13:50.440
<v Speaker 2>cause heart disease.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tmao.</v>

301
00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:51.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

302
00:13:52.010 --> 00:13:54.700
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and how's it linked to heart disease?</v>

303
00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:59.830
<v Speaker 2>A disease epidemiology studies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forget,</v>

304
00:13:59.831 --> 00:14:04.330
<v Speaker 2>but I do recall it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The study was able to give the Tmao to</v>

305
00:14:04.390 --> 00:14:06.220
<v Speaker 2>animals and they developed heart</v>
<v Speaker 2>disease.</v>

306
00:14:06.221 --> 00:14:09.400
<v Speaker 2>So it's somehow causing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forget exactly how it might be</v>

307
00:14:09.401 --> 00:14:13.450
<v Speaker 2>damaging the genome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's my recollection with a omnivores</v>

308
00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:16.090
<v Speaker 2>or predators.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

309
00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:18.910
<v Speaker 2>I think as red meat is the culprit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

310
00:14:18.970 --> 00:14:21.360
<v Speaker 2>So are they giving us to rats are the</v>
<v Speaker 2>given this too?</v>

311
00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:24.070
<v Speaker 2>It was a mouse study again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I mean mice might be different from</v>

312
00:14:24.071 --> 00:14:25.830
<v Speaker 2>humans of course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

313
00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:28.420
<v Speaker 2>but the other problem with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with meat in general from,</v>

314
00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:32.170
<v Speaker 2>from animals is that there's a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>noise in there and it's easy to eat a</v>

315
00:14:32.171 --> 00:14:35.380
<v Speaker 2>lot of meat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so if you have high levels of mino</v>

316
00:14:35.381 --> 00:14:39.070
<v Speaker 2>acids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it will activate this mtor pathway,</v>

317
00:14:39.071 --> 00:14:42.850
<v Speaker 2>one of those three longevity pathways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you don't want that.</v>

318
00:14:43.090 --> 00:14:45.090
<v Speaker 2>You don't want that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't want that because [inaudible]</v>

319
00:14:45.370 --> 00:14:48.790
<v Speaker 2>has evolved to cents times of adversity</v>
<v Speaker 2>and stress and hunger.</v>

320
00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:52.010
<v Speaker 2>So why do people see a performance</v>
<v Speaker 2>benefit when</v>

321
00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:54.230
<v Speaker 3>they consume branch chain amino acids?</v>

322
00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:59.310
<v Speaker 2>A really good question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in the short run,</v>

323
00:14:59.490 --> 00:15:04.200
<v Speaker 2>just like taking testosterone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it will give you performance benefits,</v>

324
00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:08.010
<v Speaker 2>but we think in the long run it'll</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually come back to bite you.</v>

325
00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:11.310
<v Speaker 2>So how will blend branched chain amino</v>
<v Speaker 2>acids come back to bite you.</v>

326
00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:14.580
<v Speaker 2>So branch chain amino acids will</v>
<v Speaker 2>activate this mtor pathway.</v>

327
00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:16.800
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and</v>

328
00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:19.860
<v Speaker 2>when we do that in animals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we actually,</v>

329
00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:21.900
<v Speaker 2>we reduced their lifespan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's the opposite.</v>

330
00:15:21.901 --> 00:15:26.670
<v Speaker 2>You want to keep those levels low.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting that that seems,</v>

331
00:15:27.130 --> 00:15:28.360
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for a dummy like me,</v>

332
00:15:28.390 --> 00:15:32.230
<v Speaker 3>it seems counterintuitive because it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's making you perform better.</v>

333
00:15:32.290 --> 00:15:34.120
<v Speaker 3>Currently you would see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would think,</v>

334
00:15:34.121 --> 00:15:37.120
<v Speaker 3>especially something like amino acids</v>
<v Speaker 3>and natural part of the human body,</v>

335
00:15:37.630 --> 00:15:39.160
<v Speaker 3>you would think that that would be</v>
<v Speaker 3>beneficial.</v>

336
00:15:39.190 --> 00:15:41.380
<v Speaker 3>You're adding to your body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's something that it needs.</v>

337
00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:42.303
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would.</v>

338
00:15:42.370 --> 00:15:44.800
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what you should consider is that</v>

339
00:15:44.801 --> 00:15:48.070
<v Speaker 2>it's a tradeoff off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a theory that's probably</v>

340
00:15:48.071 --> 00:15:49.450
<v Speaker 2>correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

341
00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:51.100
<v Speaker 2>it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

342
00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:55.570
<v Speaker 2>some Tom Kirkwood's terror theory called</v>
<v Speaker 2>the disposable Soma and our bodies want</v>

343
00:15:55.571 --> 00:15:58.300
<v Speaker 2>to do one of two things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>either want to grow really fast and</v>

344
00:15:58.301 --> 00:16:01.750
<v Speaker 2>reproduce fast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>build up a lot of muscle cells,</v>

345
00:16:01.751 --> 00:16:04.030
<v Speaker 2>divide that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In the short run,</v>

346
00:16:04.650 --> 00:16:05.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd be fertile,</v>

347
00:16:05.801 --> 00:16:09.220
<v Speaker 2>you can run,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but actually that set the expensive</v>

348
00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:13.390
<v Speaker 2>hunkering down and building a long</v>
<v Speaker 2>lasting body and that's a tradeoff over</v>

349
00:16:13.391 --> 00:16:15.760
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so animals that grow fast and</v>

350
00:16:15.761 --> 00:16:18.640
<v Speaker 2>reproduce fast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a mouse will only have a short</v>

351
00:16:18.641 --> 00:16:23.170
<v Speaker 2>lifespan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas a whale that grows slowly and</v>

352
00:16:23.171 --> 00:16:25.780
<v Speaker 2>reproduced slowly will live a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>

353
00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:26.763
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

354
00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:31.220
<v Speaker 3>the idea is you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're limiting your calories,</v>

355
00:16:31.270 --> 00:16:34.180
<v Speaker 3>eliminating your carbohydrates,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're limiting your protein,</v>

356
00:16:34.181 --> 00:16:38.170
<v Speaker 3>you're limiting your amino acids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're ramping up on all these</v>

357
00:16:38.610 --> 00:16:41.400
<v Speaker 2>beneficial molecules,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

358
00:16:41.401 --> 00:16:44.280
<v Speaker 2>These,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these pathways that have evolved since</v>

359
00:16:44.281 --> 00:16:48.240
<v Speaker 2>the beginning of life to make us live</v>
<v Speaker 2>longer during adversity so he can thrive</v>

360
00:16:48.241 --> 00:16:49.770
<v Speaker 2>when times come back.</v>

361
00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:54.900
<v Speaker 3>Do you take into consideration quality</v>
<v Speaker 3>of life versus length of life?</v>

362
00:16:54.930 --> 00:16:57.300
<v Speaker 3>Like is there a sweet spot?</v>

363
00:16:58.100 --> 00:16:58.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

364
00:16:58.460 --> 00:17:00.530
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to ask the mice how they feel,</v>

365
00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:03.950
<v Speaker 2>but they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we do test them and we do frailty</v>

366
00:17:03.951 --> 00:17:07.370
<v Speaker 2>studies and we can see that they got</v>
<v Speaker 2>better memory and they can run further</v>

367
00:17:07.371 --> 00:17:11.180
<v Speaker 2>on a treadmill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The stronger those kinds of things they</v>

368
00:17:11.181 --> 00:17:14.780
<v Speaker 2>see better and we think that that</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably means they're happier as well.</v>

369
00:17:15.710 --> 00:17:19.490
<v Speaker 2>And when you're taking in protein,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if you're not eating mammals,</v>

370
00:17:19.491 --> 00:17:21.210
<v Speaker 2>are you eating a lot of fish?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

371
00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:23.270
<v Speaker 2>fish is fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>White meat.</v>

372
00:17:23.271 --> 00:17:27.040
<v Speaker 2>I indulge A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like chipped in that kind of chickens,</v>

373
00:17:27.050 --> 00:17:28.880
<v Speaker 2>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not too much of it,</v>

374
00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:31.370
<v Speaker 2>but I'm trying to eat as many</v>
<v Speaker 2>vegetables,</v>

375
00:17:31.371 --> 00:17:35.080
<v Speaker 2>especially the colored ones for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>reason that I said which is well,</v>

376
00:17:35.090 --> 00:17:37.280
<v Speaker 2>a few reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One is that you don't ingest as much</v>

377
00:17:37.281 --> 00:17:40.930
<v Speaker 2>protein as you otherwise would.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get all the vitamins,</v>

378
00:17:40.931 --> 00:17:44.750
<v Speaker 2>but you also get those molecules from</v>
<v Speaker 2>plants that we think make you healthy.</v>

379
00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:48.620
<v Speaker 2>So reserves will just one of a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 2>polyphenols that plants make when</v>

380
00:17:48.621 --> 00:17:50.850
<v Speaker 2>they're stressed and when plants are</v>
<v Speaker 2>stressed,</v>

381
00:17:50.851 --> 00:17:54.360
<v Speaker 2>they go colored so that the purples and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reds and blues,</v>

382
00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:56.670
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are molecules that are generally</v>

383
00:17:56.671 --> 00:18:00.780
<v Speaker 2>healthy and I think one of the few</v>
<v Speaker 2>scientists who thinks this,</v>

384
00:18:00.781 --> 00:18:05.640
<v Speaker 2>but I think we've evolved as animals to</v>
<v Speaker 2>sense the plant world and when our food</v>

385
00:18:05.641 --> 00:18:09.720
<v Speaker 2>supply is stressed out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then our body's sense that bite when we</v>

386
00:18:09.930 --> 00:18:12.660
<v Speaker 2>ingest them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we get these molecules like virtual and</v>

387
00:18:12.661 --> 00:18:17.040
<v Speaker 2>we've evolved to sense that and we get</v>
<v Speaker 2>the benefits of longevity as a side</v>

388
00:18:17.041 --> 00:18:19.620
<v Speaker 2>effect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so</v>

389
00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:24.940
<v Speaker 3>this is really fascinating to me because</v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea that you're trying to balance</v>

390
00:18:24.941 --> 00:18:29.941
<v Speaker 3>out this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the concept of a mouse growing very</v>

391
00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:35.280
<v Speaker 3>quickly but dying quickly as well versus</v>
<v Speaker 3>something that can extend and live</v>

392
00:18:36.401 --> 00:18:41.401
<v Speaker 3>longer and be more vital or have more</v>
<v Speaker 3>vitality for a longer period of time.</v>

393
00:18:43.610 --> 00:18:45.380
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so here's the great thing is that now</v>

394
00:18:45.381 --> 00:18:46.430
<v Speaker 2>that we've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we believe,</v>

395
00:18:46.431 --> 00:18:49.250
<v Speaker 2>we figured out why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just why,</v>

396
00:18:49.251 --> 00:18:52.340
<v Speaker 2>but how this all works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are the genes and pathways in the</v>

397
00:18:52.341 --> 00:18:55.760
<v Speaker 2>body that control this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can have our cake and eat it too.</v>

398
00:18:56.270 --> 00:19:00.170
<v Speaker 2>We can at least in a mouse and probably</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a human in a few years' time,</v>

399
00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:02.720
<v Speaker 2>and maybe even with the supplements</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll see.</v>

400
00:19:03.290 --> 00:19:08.290
<v Speaker 2>We can trick the body into being hungry</v>
<v Speaker 2>and being in adversity or even if you're</v>

401
00:19:08.991 --> 00:19:13.730
<v Speaker 2>eating a lot or you're not exercising</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so we can turn slowly,</v>

402
00:19:13.731 --> 00:19:18.731
<v Speaker 2>but eventually turning a mouse into more</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a human so that you,</v>

403
00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:20.930
<v Speaker 2>even though you can grow and reproduce</v>
<v Speaker 2>quickly,</v>

404
00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:24.110
<v Speaker 2>you still turn on these protective</v>
<v Speaker 2>pathways and live a long time.</v>

405
00:19:24.290 --> 00:19:27.890
<v Speaker 2>The best example is the nematode worm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>artsy elegance.</v>

406
00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:32.510
<v Speaker 2>It's been studied a lot for longevity</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the mutations that make those worms</v>

407
00:19:32.511 --> 00:19:37.220
<v Speaker 2>live sometimes two and up to 10 times</v>
<v Speaker 2>longer are activating genes that are</v>

408
00:19:37.730 --> 00:19:40.610
<v Speaker 2>normally only turned on when they</v>
<v Speaker 2>hunkered down and turn into a little</v>

409
00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:43.670
<v Speaker 2>dour,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dour or a stage,</v>

410
00:19:43.671 --> 00:19:44.660
<v Speaker 2>which means that they're.</v>

411
00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:47.990
<v Speaker 2>They're not really reproducing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're just hibernating.</v>

412
00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:52.040
<v Speaker 2>So you can have a hibernation of</v>
<v Speaker 2>benefits but still live a normal healthy</v>

413
00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:54.860
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is from manipulating genes.</v>

414
00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:56.870
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this all comes from genetics.</v>

415
00:19:56.871 --> 00:20:00.890
<v Speaker 2>So I'm a geneticist at Harvard and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>way the breakthrough came,</v>

416
00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:05.570
<v Speaker 2>so going back in the 19 eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was antioxidants mutations because</v>

417
00:20:05.571 --> 00:20:08.630
<v Speaker 2>people really didn't have a handle on</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was going on and the idea that you</v>

418
00:20:08.631 --> 00:20:13.370
<v Speaker 2>could slow down aging with one gene or</v>
<v Speaker 2>one drug was ludicrous because it's so</v>

419
00:20:13.371 --> 00:20:16.460
<v Speaker 2>complicated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now we know from genetic studies is</v>

420
00:20:16.461 --> 00:20:20.180
<v Speaker 2>that you can find mutations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hundreds of them actually in organisms</v>

421
00:20:20.181 --> 00:20:23.690
<v Speaker 2>that it linkedin lifespan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's not as complicated as we</v>

422
00:20:23.691 --> 00:20:27.170
<v Speaker 2>thought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about Myostatin inhibitors and the</v>

423
00:20:27.171 --> 00:20:30.290
<v Speaker 2>studies that they've done with mice?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They turned them on and off and they've</v>

424
00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:32.420
<v Speaker 2>grown those super mice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

425
00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:35.300
<v Speaker 2>Hock mice wellbeing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A hulk doesn't mean you'll live longer,</v>

426
00:20:35.490 --> 00:20:37.100
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Didn't they live longer though?</v>

427
00:20:38.250 --> 00:20:39.110
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did they?</v>

428
00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:41.390
<v Speaker 2>I believe they did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that was one of the weird side</v>

429
00:20:41.391 --> 00:20:42.860
<v Speaker 2>effects.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

430
00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:47.630
<v Speaker 2>if you allow me to speculate as to why</v>
<v Speaker 2>that might've happened is so</v>

431
00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:50.410
<v Speaker 1>being bulky is good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's find out what's correct for.</v>

432
00:20:50.650 --> 00:20:53.400
<v Speaker 1>And Jamie will pull it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well one of them,</v>

433
00:20:53.410 --> 00:20:56.680
<v Speaker 1>but one of the things it bulky is good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bulky will increase your metabolism,</v>

434
00:20:56.681 --> 00:20:59.920
<v Speaker 1>it'll get rid of the fat and the fat is</v>
<v Speaker 1>a real problem because fred fat will</v>

435
00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:03.340
<v Speaker 1>make you inflamed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Being fat is one of the worst things you</v>

436
00:21:03.341 --> 00:21:06.970
<v Speaker 1>can you just fat shamed I did were very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very upset at you right now.</v>

437
00:21:07.030 --> 00:21:08.980
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>build up muscle as well.</v>

438
00:21:08.981 --> 00:21:12.460
<v Speaker 1>Some people are overweight and have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of muscle and they're a lot better</v>

439
00:21:12.461 --> 00:21:17.170
<v Speaker 1>off when you teach classes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I assume I teach at Harvard.</v>

440
00:21:17.171 --> 00:21:20.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you say that fat is bad,</v>

441
00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:23.590
<v Speaker 1>do you get a new reaction over the last</v>
<v Speaker 1>couple of years?</v>

442
00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:25.450
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or do you,</v>

443
00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:28.450
<v Speaker 1>do you find a way around saying it like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you generally get okay.</v>

444
00:21:28.451 --> 00:21:32.350
<v Speaker 1>Comments on my lectures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I wasn't saying fat people are bad</v>

445
00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:35.240
<v Speaker 1>or saying having found in your vice</v>
<v Speaker 1>sells a bad.</v>

446
00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:37.240
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like what you're saying.</v>

447
00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:41.320
<v Speaker 1>So you're breaking it down to cells.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not picking on anybody here at</v>

448
00:21:41.470 --> 00:21:43.750
<v Speaker 1>Myostatin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Insufficiency produces 15 percent life</v>

449
00:21:43.751 --> 00:21:45.160
<v Speaker 1>extension in mice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>

450
00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:48.370
<v Speaker 1>So those milestone inhibitors make the</v>
<v Speaker 1>mice grow longer.</v>

451
00:21:48.371 --> 00:21:53.350
<v Speaker 1>So you think that might have had an</v>
<v Speaker 1>effect by virtue of the fact that</v>

452
00:21:53.351 --> 00:21:56.710
<v Speaker 1>they're more bulky and they have more</v>
<v Speaker 1>muscle tissue and they burn off more</v>

453
00:21:56.711 --> 00:21:58.570
<v Speaker 1>fat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one theory.</v>

454
00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:02.770
<v Speaker 1>The other thing would be that so muscles</v>
<v Speaker 1>are secreting molecules called myokines</v>

455
00:22:02.771 --> 00:22:05.980
<v Speaker 1>into the bloodstream and we don't know</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they all are,</v>

456
00:22:06.130 --> 00:22:09.280
<v Speaker 1>but when you exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do release some of these and they</v>

457
00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:12.520
<v Speaker 1>may also be contributing because muscles</v>
<v Speaker 1>are signaling to the whole body.</v>

458
00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:15.230
<v Speaker 1>When you go for a run,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not that your muscles get an</v>

459
00:22:15.250 --> 00:22:17.530
<v Speaker 1>exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything in your body gets an exercise</v>

460
00:22:17.531 --> 00:22:21.250
<v Speaker 1>by these communication molecules and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why if you fuse and old mouse to</v>

461
00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:24.100
<v Speaker 1>young mouse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can have these benefits that the</v>

462
00:22:24.101 --> 00:22:27.830
<v Speaker 1>young mouse and parts on the olden</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually negatively vice versa.</v>

463
00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:31.360
<v Speaker 1>And when you save by fuse you mean by</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking the blood of the old mouse and</v>

464
00:22:31.361 --> 00:22:32.910
<v Speaker 1>putting it into the young man?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

465
00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:34.420
<v Speaker 1>But what we.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What we actually do,</v>

466
00:22:34.421 --> 00:22:36.550
<v Speaker 1>because that's too hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't need humans,</v>

467
00:22:36.551 --> 00:22:40.480
<v Speaker 1>but in mice what you do as you saw the</v>
<v Speaker 1>skin together so that the blood flows</v>

468
00:22:40.481 --> 00:22:42.400
<v Speaker 1>between them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

469
00:22:42.401 --> 00:22:46.840
<v Speaker 1>It's not so pleasant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't seem to be too badly</v>

470
00:22:46.841 --> 00:22:48.790
<v Speaker 1>affected once they learn how to walk in</v>
<v Speaker 1>sync.</v>

471
00:22:50.350 --> 00:22:53.530
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

472
00:22:53.531 --> 00:22:55.840
<v Speaker 1>to all your listeners,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't do those experiments in my lab,</v>

473
00:22:55.841 --> 00:22:59.740
<v Speaker 1>but when I say we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the scientific community as a</v>

474
00:22:59.741 --> 00:23:00.750
<v Speaker 1>whole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

475
00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:03.400
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are your thoughts on if you have</v>

476
00:23:03.401 --> 00:23:05.890
<v Speaker 1>any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the startups that are actually</v>

477
00:23:05.891 --> 00:23:10.891
<v Speaker 1>taking the blood of young people and in</v>
<v Speaker 1>injecting it into the bodies of older</v>

478
00:23:11.981 --> 00:23:12.814
<v Speaker 1>folks?</v>

479
00:23:15.210 --> 00:23:18.400
<v Speaker 1>So I don't think there's a scientific</v>
<v Speaker 1>reason to say it won't work and the</v>

480
00:23:18.401 --> 00:23:20.440
<v Speaker 1>scientists are involved or some of my</v>
<v Speaker 1>great colleagues,</v>

481
00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:22.960
<v Speaker 1>very smart people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever done it?</v>

482
00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:24.300
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

483
00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:27.010
<v Speaker 1>That's a bit extreme for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think it could work.</v>

484
00:23:27.850 --> 00:23:31.480
<v Speaker 1>It's just a little bit out there for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what they're going to do,</v>

485
00:23:31.481 --> 00:23:34.720
<v Speaker 1>what they're doing actually is treating</v>
<v Speaker 1>people with neurological disorders.</v>

486
00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:38.920
<v Speaker 1>A lot of these startups,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm involved in probably 15 startups</v>

487
00:23:38.921 --> 00:23:41.140
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What we're trying to do is to treat</v>

488
00:23:41.141 --> 00:23:45.830
<v Speaker 1>diseases of aging and even rare</v>
<v Speaker 1>childhood diseases because you can't</v>

489
00:23:45.831 --> 00:23:46.070
<v Speaker 1>treat</v>

490
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:49.940
<v Speaker 2>it aging as a business model.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is no disease called aging yet,</v>

491
00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:52.340
<v Speaker 2>but anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting back to the science,</v>

492
00:23:52.341 --> 00:23:54.260
<v Speaker 2>I think that it's based on solid</v>
<v Speaker 2>science,</v>

493
00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:58.580
<v Speaker 2>but the future is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is I think a better way to go about this</v>

494
00:23:58.581 --> 00:24:02.330
<v Speaker 2>is to find what the actual molecules are</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the blood and just make those.</v>

495
00:24:02.331 --> 00:24:05.380
<v Speaker 2>Don't give the whole kit caboodle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

496
00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:09.790
<v Speaker 3>When you said this twice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you think aging is a disease or maybe</v>

497
00:24:09.791 --> 00:24:12.430
<v Speaker 3>perhaps should be treated as a disease</v>
<v Speaker 3>or classified?</v>

498
00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:13.470
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

499
00:24:13.471 --> 00:24:15.420
<v Speaker 2>Think aging should be classified as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>disease.</v>

500
00:24:15.450 --> 00:24:18.110
<v Speaker 2>We should think of it as a disease.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean why?</v>

501
00:24:18.270 --> 00:24:21.540
<v Speaker 2>Why shouldn't we?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything else that goes on in the body</v>

502
00:24:21.541 --> 00:24:24.540
<v Speaker 2>over time that's bad for us is</v>
<v Speaker 2>considered a disease.</v>

503
00:24:24.850 --> 00:24:27.270
<v Speaker 2>Do you know why aging isn't considered a</v>
<v Speaker 2>disease?</v>

504
00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:29.430
<v Speaker 2>Because it happens to everybody?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

505
00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:31.190
<v Speaker 2>That's the only reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

506
00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:33.300
<v Speaker 2>it happens to most people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ninety percent of people in the</v>

507
00:24:33.301 --> 00:24:35.610
<v Speaker 2>developed world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but why is that a reason to say,</v>

508
00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:36.301
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's natural.</v>

509
00:24:36.301 --> 00:24:39.990
<v Speaker 2>We should just deal with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We used to say that about cancer and we</v>

510
00:24:39.991 --> 00:24:41.610
<v Speaker 2>used to say it about dying from an</v>
<v Speaker 2>infection.</v>

511
00:24:41.710 --> 00:24:44.800
<v Speaker 3>When you say it happens to 90 percent of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the people in the developed world,</v>

512
00:24:44.830 --> 00:24:45.910
<v Speaker 3>what happens?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The other 10,</v>

513
00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:46.710
<v Speaker 3>they die.</v>

514
00:24:46.710 --> 00:24:48.380
<v Speaker 2>He'd play a boss I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

515
00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:50.270
<v Speaker 2>Let's see what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they die young.</v>

516
00:24:50.650 --> 00:24:51.483
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

517
00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:53.030
<v Speaker 2>Just clarifying.</v>

518
00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:55.251
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>

519
00:24:55.251 --> 00:24:58.580
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's dis ease.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a problem,</v>

520
00:24:58.640 --> 00:24:59.910
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Aging is a problem with you.</v>

521
00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:04.580
<v Speaker 3>I saw an old gentleman yesterday and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>was painful just to watch this poor guy</v>

522
00:25:04.581 --> 00:25:09.581
<v Speaker 3>walk hunched over and just struggling to</v>
<v Speaker 3>move at an incredibly slow pace.</v>

523
00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:11.870
<v Speaker 3>That seems like a person with the</v>
<v Speaker 3>disease.</v>

524
00:25:12.530 --> 00:25:12.981
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>

525
00:25:12.981 --> 00:25:16.340
<v Speaker 2>And imagine if we were on a planet now</v>
<v Speaker 2>or you know,</v>

526
00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:21.650
<v Speaker 2>an island where everybody leaves 300</v>
<v Speaker 2>years and we'd show up and you and I in</v>

527
00:25:21.651 --> 00:25:24.530
<v Speaker 2>our midlife was signed to look older</v>
<v Speaker 2>already.</v>

528
00:25:24.531 --> 00:25:27.380
<v Speaker 2>They're going to look at us and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is wrong with you guys?</v>

529
00:25:27.730 --> 00:25:31.820
<v Speaker 2>We need to treat you urgently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need to call this a new type of</v>

530
00:25:31.821 --> 00:25:35.870
<v Speaker 2>syndrome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's only because we all tend to go</v>

531
00:25:35.871 --> 00:25:37.640
<v Speaker 2>through this that we think it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>acceptable,</v>

532
00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:43.180
<v Speaker 2>but I would argue it's the biggest</v>
<v Speaker 2>threat to the healthcare system is the</v>

533
00:25:43.251 --> 00:25:45.080
<v Speaker 2>biggest threat to the world's economy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually,</v>

534
00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:49.610
<v Speaker 2>is the inability of us to treat people</v>
<v Speaker 2>in their old age and keeping them</v>

535
00:25:49.611 --> 00:25:50.990
<v Speaker 2>healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mm.</v>

536
00:25:51.750 --> 00:25:56.580
<v Speaker 3>Now some people look at it a different</v>
<v Speaker 3>way and their consideration is that</v>

537
00:25:56.581 --> 00:25:59.280
<v Speaker 3>there's an overpopulation problem as it</v>
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>

538
00:25:59.670 --> 00:26:04.050
<v Speaker 3>And folks like you want to walk around</v>
<v Speaker 3>living to be 300 years old,</v>

539
00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:07.380
<v Speaker 3>have a gang of kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could create a mess.</v>

540
00:26:08.790 --> 00:26:10.330
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I have three kids.</v>

541
00:26:10.950 --> 00:26:14.040
<v Speaker 2>That's enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's more than I was going to have a.</v>

542
00:26:14.290 --> 00:26:15.130
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

543
00:26:15.210 --> 00:26:16.600
<v Speaker 2>we do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to do the math though.</v>

544
00:26:16.630 --> 00:26:18.710
<v Speaker 2>How much with the population grow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and</v>

545
00:26:20.270 --> 00:26:23.500
<v Speaker 2>I'm actually working with a number of</v>
<v Speaker 2>people to try and calculate this.</v>

546
00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:27.130
<v Speaker 2>A couple of economists in London that</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're working on.</v>

547
00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:31.960
<v Speaker 2>So this is this really a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree with you that if this comes in,</v>

548
00:26:31.961 --> 00:26:34.630
<v Speaker 2>I would actually say when this comes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when this comes is,</v>

549
00:26:34.750 --> 00:26:37.840
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's coming as there's dozens of</v>
<v Speaker 2>companies working on drugs.</v>

550
00:26:38.830 --> 00:26:41.650
<v Speaker 2>The sciences here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so let's say it's coming anyway,</v>

551
00:26:41.651 --> 00:26:44.490
<v Speaker 2>so we have to deal with how are we going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to deal with it?</v>

552
00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:45.960
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's first of all understand what the</v>

553
00:26:45.961 --> 00:26:48.420
<v Speaker 2>future looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can't look backwards,</v>

554
00:26:48.710 --> 00:26:50.250
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because no one's ever invented this</v>

555
00:26:50.251 --> 00:26:52.050
<v Speaker 2>stuff before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we have to look forwards.</v>

556
00:26:52.050 --> 00:26:55.110
<v Speaker 2>What's the world look like in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 2>population?</v>

557
00:26:55.350 --> 00:26:59.640
<v Speaker 2>It's not as bad as you might think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you stopped aging today and everybody</v>

558
00:26:59.641 --> 00:27:04.641
<v Speaker 2>just went on forever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the population growth rate would be less</v>

559
00:27:04.831 --> 00:27:08.820
<v Speaker 2>than the rate of immigration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now that's not.</v>

560
00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:13.020
<v Speaker 2>I can't go on forever of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what we find is as people healthier,</v>

561
00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:16.260
<v Speaker 2>especially in developing nations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have fewer kids,</v>

562
00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:19.560
<v Speaker 2>so the calculation shows that it would</v>
<v Speaker 2>eventually taper off,</v>

563
00:27:19.561 --> 00:27:23.400
<v Speaker 2>so the human population will taper off</v>
<v Speaker 2>about nine to 10 billion people and then</v>

564
00:27:23.401 --> 00:27:26.070
<v Speaker 2>stay there and that population will be</v>
<v Speaker 2>the happiest,</v>

565
00:27:26.071 --> 00:27:27.360
<v Speaker 2>healthiest people in the world.</v>

566
00:27:27.690 --> 00:27:29.160
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why do they predict that?</v>

567
00:27:29.190 --> 00:27:32.340
<v Speaker 3>Because I was having this conversation</v>
<v Speaker 3>with someone the other day that as</v>

568
00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:37.590
<v Speaker 3>people become more affluent and society</v>
<v Speaker 3>becomes more urban,</v>

569
00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:41.710
<v Speaker 3>people will have less and less children</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the population will stabilize.</v>

570
00:27:41.711 --> 00:27:42.930
<v Speaker 3>Is that the theory behind this?</v>

571
00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:45.650
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we'll actually education is a major</v>

572
00:27:45.651 --> 00:27:46.760
<v Speaker 2>part of that as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

573
00:27:46.990 --> 00:27:49.610
<v Speaker 2>Women's education is the main thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

574
00:27:50.150 --> 00:27:52.980
<v Speaker 2>but also just being healthy or lifts</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

575
00:27:53.060 --> 00:27:56.210
<v Speaker 2>the wealth of a nation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And by women's education,</v>

576
00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:58.760
<v Speaker 2>do you mean extended education so that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

577
00:27:58.761 --> 00:28:00.620
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they pursue careers?</v>

578
00:28:00.621 --> 00:28:00.870
<v Speaker 2>Is that</v>

579
00:28:00.870 --> 00:28:02.190
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea or is it,</v>

580
00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:04.830
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously most people understand</v>

581
00:28:05.130 --> 00:28:08.430
<v Speaker 2>these are made like where?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where's the education contributing to a</v>

582
00:28:08.431 --> 00:28:10.290
<v Speaker 2>lower population?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

583
00:28:10.291 --> 00:28:12.990
<v Speaker 2>so my understanding is that the first</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing you do,</v>

584
00:28:12.991 --> 00:28:14.610
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you educate young women,</v>

585
00:28:14.611 --> 00:28:17.100
<v Speaker 2>is that they can make choices for</v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves and they are not just</v>

586
00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:18.580
<v Speaker 2>subjugated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

587
00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:21.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most men would like to have more so,</v>

588
00:28:21.710 --> 00:28:23.790
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're thinking of like third world</v>

589
00:28:23.791 --> 00:28:26.760
<v Speaker 2>and write the real developing world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's where the population is a</v>

590
00:28:26.761 --> 00:28:29.160
<v Speaker 2>real problem in Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They actually are struggling to keep up</v>

591
00:28:29.161 --> 00:28:33.600
<v Speaker 2>with their population,</v>
<v Speaker 2>know they've got an aging tsunami,</v>

592
00:28:33.601 --> 00:28:35.310
<v Speaker 2>so to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Same with Japan.</v>

593
00:28:35.311 --> 00:28:37.350
<v Speaker 2>The average farmer in Japan is 65 years</v>
<v Speaker 2>old.</v>

594
00:28:37.351 --> 00:28:39.960
<v Speaker 2>They got a real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>China's about to head that way too,</v>

595
00:28:40.290 --> 00:28:43.230
<v Speaker 2>and that's going to drag the economy of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the planet down and it's gonna be a real</v>

596
00:28:43.231 --> 00:28:45.060
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to waste so much money on</v>

597
00:28:45.061 --> 00:28:46.950
<v Speaker 2>keeping older people alive for the last</v>
<v Speaker 2>10,</v>

598
00:28:46.951 --> 00:28:48.540
<v Speaker 2>20 years of their life with dementia.</v>

599
00:28:48.780 --> 00:28:51.090
<v Speaker 2>Frailty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that could be trillions of dollars,</v>

600
00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:54.480
<v Speaker 2>just $50,000,000,000,000 just in this</v>
<v Speaker 2>country alone that could be spent on</v>

601
00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:57.090
<v Speaker 2>figuring out how to solve global</v>
<v Speaker 2>warming,</v>

602
00:28:57.780 --> 00:28:59.910
<v Speaker 2>better education,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the environment,</v>

603
00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:03.660
<v Speaker 2>saving the one third species that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>becoming threatened.</v>

604
00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:06.180
<v Speaker 2>That,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why I think tackling aging isn't</v>

605
00:29:06.181 --> 00:29:08.290
<v Speaker 2>a selfish act.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's probably the most generous Dec</v>

606
00:29:08.350 --> 00:29:12.450
<v Speaker 2>action that I could give the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's an interesting way of looking at</v>

607
00:29:12.451 --> 00:29:13.350
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

608
00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:16.110
<v Speaker 2>what populations as a whole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

609
00:29:16.111 --> 00:29:17.830
<v Speaker 2>when you look at the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

610
00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:20.340
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where are the people living the longest</v>

611
00:29:20.341 --> 00:29:22.470
<v Speaker 2>and why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

612
00:29:22.471 --> 00:29:24.930
<v Speaker 2>it's debatable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are these blue zones.</v>

613
00:29:24.931 --> 00:29:27.330
<v Speaker 2>I think many of your listeners will have</v>
<v Speaker 2>heard about those.</v>

614
00:29:27.850 --> 00:29:30.570
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there are pockets that have great</v>

615
00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:33.630
<v Speaker 2>genes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they also have great diets and</v>

616
00:29:33.631 --> 00:29:34.680
<v Speaker 2>lifestyles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the,</v>

617
00:29:34.710 --> 00:29:38.910
<v Speaker 2>the best one that I'm familiar with is</v>
<v Speaker 2>the island of Okinawa in Japan.</v>

618
00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:41.980
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and by the way I used to follow the</v>

619
00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:44.830
<v Speaker 2>Okinawan Diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a couple of my good friends wrote a book</v>

620
00:29:44.831 --> 00:29:48.070
<v Speaker 2>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I was on to when some fish felt</v>

621
00:29:48.071 --> 00:29:49.270
<v Speaker 2>really great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't keep it up,</v>

622
00:29:49.690 --> 00:29:51.310
<v Speaker 2>but those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why couldn't you keep it up?</v>

623
00:29:51.750 --> 00:29:55.280
<v Speaker 2>I had kids and our meals turned into</v>
<v Speaker 2>pizzas and pasta.</v>

624
00:29:55.870 --> 00:29:56.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unfortunately.</v>

625
00:29:56.771 --> 00:29:59.590
<v Speaker 2>But I'm getting back there now that my</v>
<v Speaker 2>kids are teenagers,</v>

626
00:29:59.591 --> 00:30:04.591
<v Speaker 2>but the Okinawans date,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they live into their hundreds of,</v>

627
00:30:04.930 --> 00:30:07.000
<v Speaker 2>fairly frequently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not one in a million.</v>

628
00:30:07.050 --> 00:30:09.580
<v Speaker 2>It's more like one in 100,000 or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

629
00:30:09.581 --> 00:30:11.460
<v Speaker 2>So it's 10 times higher.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

630
00:30:11.670 --> 00:30:14.560
<v Speaker 2>they work most of their lives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They physically active,</v>

631
00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:19.300
<v Speaker 2>they fast a lot and they have a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>green leafy vegetables and that seems to</v>

632
00:30:19.301 --> 00:30:21.370
<v Speaker 2>be the secret.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's,</v>

633
00:30:21.371 --> 00:30:22.520
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were,</v>

634
00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:27.340
<v Speaker 2>there were selling something was</v>
<v Speaker 2>something about their mineral rich diet.</v>

635
00:30:27.650 --> 00:30:29.960
<v Speaker 2>Remember they were selling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like a big thing for awhile.</v>

636
00:30:30.010 --> 00:30:33.310
<v Speaker 2>Coral calcium.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they were using that as an example</v>

637
00:30:33.311 --> 00:30:35.950
<v Speaker 2>of why the Okinawans were living so</v>
<v Speaker 2>long.</v>

638
00:30:35.951 --> 00:30:37.650
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do remember add,</v>

639
00:30:37.870 --> 00:30:40.480
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But in scientific circles we weren't</v>

640
00:30:40.481 --> 00:30:41.314
<v Speaker 2>really bothered with it.</v>

641
00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:44.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there's calcium is calcium,</v>

642
00:30:44.531 --> 00:30:45.520
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

643
00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:46.940
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>better,</v>

644
00:30:47.020 --> 00:30:50.920
<v Speaker 2>better calcium from coral or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I might even be wrong about that,</v>

645
00:30:51.370 --> 00:30:56.260
<v Speaker 2>but I just remember reading about the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okinawans and the speculation.</v>

646
00:30:56.330 --> 00:30:57.940
<v Speaker 2>They seaweed as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

647
00:30:58.630 --> 00:31:01.600
<v Speaker 2>Which is very healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably the best thing that they do is</v>

648
00:31:02.110 --> 00:31:05.140
<v Speaker 2>they don't overeat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stop at 70 percent.</v>

649
00:31:06.550 --> 00:31:07.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a glutton.</v>

650
00:31:07.810 --> 00:31:11.050
<v Speaker 2>That's my number one problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just love to eat.</v>

651
00:31:11.140 --> 00:31:11.771
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

652
00:31:11.771 --> 00:31:14.020
<v Speaker 2>Me Too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I keep going once I'm in it,</v>

653
00:31:14.030 --> 00:31:16.420
<v Speaker 2>I just want to just keep shoving it in</v>
<v Speaker 2>my face,</v>

654
00:31:16.750 --> 00:31:19.750
<v Speaker 2>but I've done a good job over the last</v>
<v Speaker 2>few years of tapering that off and the</v>

655
00:31:19.751 --> 00:31:22.510
<v Speaker 2>intermittent fast and I think is</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably one of the best things I've</v>

656
00:31:22.511 --> 00:31:24.040
<v Speaker 2>ever done in terms of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

657
00:31:24.150 --> 00:31:28.030
<v Speaker 2>just maintaining energy levels,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maintaining body weight,</v>

658
00:31:28.390 --> 00:31:29.360
<v Speaker 2>that kind of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

659
00:31:29.870 --> 00:31:30.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

660
00:31:30.300 --> 00:31:32.650
<v Speaker 2>you look good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think that that's one of the best</v>

661
00:31:32.651 --> 00:31:33.550
<v Speaker 2>things that people can do.</v>

662
00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:38.110
<v Speaker 2>What we've known for 70 or more years</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually as if you calorie restrict</v>

663
00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:41.200
<v Speaker 2>animals actually even eat cells and</v>
<v Speaker 2>worlds.</v>

664
00:31:41.201 --> 00:31:45.820
<v Speaker 2>They live longer and this is the most</v>
<v Speaker 2>robust way to to prevent cancer,</v>

665
00:31:45.821 --> 00:31:47.740
<v Speaker 2>heart disease,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alzheimer's in the mouse,</v>

666
00:31:48.850 --> 00:31:53.020
<v Speaker 2>and so intimate and fasting is just a</v>
<v Speaker 2>way of me making this calorie restricted</v>

667
00:31:53.021 --> 00:31:55.210
<v Speaker 2>diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what is calorie restriction?</v>

668
00:31:55.211 --> 00:31:58.390
<v Speaker 2>It's reducing what would your doctor</v>
<v Speaker 2>would recommend for your body,</v>

669
00:31:58.750 --> 00:32:00.880
<v Speaker 2>but reducing it back to about 20 to 30</v>
<v Speaker 2>percent.</v>

670
00:32:00.881 --> 00:32:03.340
<v Speaker 2>So it's quite extreme.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not pleasant.</v>

671
00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:05.260
<v Speaker 2>I tried that for a week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gave up too hard,</v>

672
00:32:05.620 --> 00:32:08.440
<v Speaker 2>but intermittent fasting like yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's doable.</v>

673
00:32:08.620 --> 00:32:10.870
<v Speaker 2>It's not always pleasant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

674
00:32:10.871 --> 00:32:14.140
<v Speaker 2>I think that's the best way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And with the mice it works just as well</v>

675
00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:17.860
<v Speaker 2>as calorie restriction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is pretty much always being a bit</v>

676
00:32:17.861 --> 00:32:20.980
<v Speaker 2>hungry now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What other things are you looking at in</v>

677
00:32:20.981 --> 00:32:25.981
<v Speaker 2>terms of mitigating stress or like what</v>
<v Speaker 2>other factors are there that you have to</v>

678
00:32:26.471 --> 00:32:27.304
<v Speaker 2>keep an eye on?</v>

679
00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:28.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stress is a bad one.</v>

680
00:32:30.430 --> 00:32:33.850
<v Speaker 2>I try to</v>
<v Speaker 2>take life in my stride,</v>

681
00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:36.190
<v Speaker 2>not get too worried about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember what's important.</v>

682
00:32:36.850 --> 00:32:39.430
<v Speaker 2>So my heart rate rarely goes up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

683
00:32:39.470 --> 00:32:44.150
<v Speaker 2>even under a really extreme</v>
<v Speaker 2>circumstances and that that's about it.</v>

684
00:32:44.180 --> 00:32:49.180
<v Speaker 2>I try to balance my life as best I can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't go through airport scanners as</v>

685
00:32:49.281 --> 00:32:52.580
<v Speaker 2>much as I can and have x rays,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these little things.</v>

686
00:32:53.090 --> 00:32:55.670
<v Speaker 2>Do you think those are bad for you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are the new ones.</v>

687
00:32:55.671 --> 00:32:57.380
<v Speaker 2>Aren't there like a radio wave?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

688
00:32:57.381 --> 00:32:58.910
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're millimeter radio waves.</v>

689
00:32:59.230 --> 00:33:01.790
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to take any chances and</v>
<v Speaker 2>also don't want to freak people out.</v>

690
00:33:02.090 --> 00:33:04.670
<v Speaker 2>But the old style ones that were banned</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Europe first,</v>

691
00:33:04.770 --> 00:33:08.790
<v Speaker 2>they were potentially damaging x-rays.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Definitely.</v>

692
00:33:08.860 --> 00:33:11.870
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>try not to have as many as you can,</v>

693
00:33:12.350 --> 00:33:17.350
<v Speaker 2>but flying is just as bad as an x ray.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's the problem that I was going</v>

694
00:33:17.721 --> 00:33:20.420
<v Speaker 2>through a scanner and I said I don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>want to go through the scanner and they</v>

695
00:33:20.421 --> 00:33:23.810
<v Speaker 2>got quite upset because it's a bother,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they said,</v>

696
00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:26.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just as much damage to your body as</v>

697
00:33:26.601 --> 00:33:27.350
<v Speaker 2>the flight.</v>

698
00:33:27.350 --> 00:33:29.150
<v Speaker 2>And so I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why do I want to double it?</v>

699
00:33:29.470 --> 00:33:31.730
<v Speaker 2>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I go through scan is,</v>

700
00:33:31.731 --> 00:33:34.250
<v Speaker 2>but I try not to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But let me tell you why I think it's so</v>

701
00:33:34.251 --> 00:33:39.251
<v Speaker 2>bad because scan isn't going to change</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we call the epigenome.</v>

702
00:33:42.050 --> 00:33:44.060
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people haven't heard of the</v>

703
00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:46.160
<v Speaker 2>epigenome,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the genome,</v>

704
00:33:46.161 --> 00:33:49.040
<v Speaker 2>everybody knows it's your DNA.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

705
00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:53.660
<v Speaker 2>the code of life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the epigenome is what regulates and</v>

706
00:33:53.661 --> 00:33:55.590
<v Speaker 2>reads those genes at the right time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

707
00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:57.830
<v Speaker 2>And so we've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we knew about DNA,</v>

708
00:33:57.831 --> 00:33:59.390
<v Speaker 2>we know how to read the genome pretty</v>
<v Speaker 2>easily.</v>

709
00:33:59.391 --> 00:34:03.530
<v Speaker 2>We can do that now on a Mozbar sized</v>
<v Speaker 2>device in a day.</v>

710
00:34:04.030 --> 00:34:05.420
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the epigenomes quite difficult</v>

711
00:34:05.421 --> 00:34:08.840
<v Speaker 2>different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The epigenome is that the structure of</v>

712
00:34:08.841 --> 00:34:11.300
<v Speaker 2>how the DNA is looped around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you look at the chromosome,</v>

713
00:34:11.301 --> 00:34:14.020
<v Speaker 2>you're not seeing the genome,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're really basically saying</v>

714
00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:18.440
<v Speaker 2>epigenomes and what w,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I think is causing aging is not</v>

715
00:34:18.441 --> 00:34:22.220
<v Speaker 2>that you're losing the DNA structure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not having mutations,</v>

716
00:34:22.910 --> 00:34:25.580
<v Speaker 2>you're actually changing the epigenome,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the,</v>

717
00:34:26.270 --> 00:34:28.700
<v Speaker 2>the reader of the genes to put another</v>
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>

718
00:34:29.270 --> 00:34:30.730
<v Speaker 2>a compact disc,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay?</v>

719
00:34:31.270 --> 00:34:32.690
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the young audience,</v>

720
00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:35.860
<v Speaker 2>a compact discs are little things we</v>
<v Speaker 2>used to put music on a.</v>

721
00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:37.033
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are,</v>

722
00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:40.130
<v Speaker 2>these are digital information of course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the reason we switched to digital in</v>

723
00:34:40.131 --> 00:34:44.390
<v Speaker 2>the first place is that it's very</v>
<v Speaker 2>copyable and it doesn't wear out.</v>

724
00:34:44.620 --> 00:34:46.100
<v Speaker 2>Reza,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a cassette tape,</v>

725
00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:48.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people our age know that if you try to</v>

726
00:34:48.921 --> 00:34:51.200
<v Speaker 2>copy that a thousand times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's not much left at the end.</v>

727
00:34:52.690 --> 00:34:55.310
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Compact disc inflammation is the</v>

728
00:34:55.311 --> 00:34:58.700
<v Speaker 2>genome,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the epigenome is the reader of the CD,</v>

729
00:34:58.850 --> 00:35:03.260
<v Speaker 2>that little laser that goes around and</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I think is causing aging is not the</v>

730
00:35:03.261 --> 00:35:06.140
<v Speaker 2>loss of the digital information,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's the reader,</v>

731
00:35:06.150 --> 00:35:09.800
<v Speaker 2>the analog part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's like a cassette tape that</v>

732
00:35:09.801 --> 00:35:12.070
<v Speaker 2>eventually runs out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what we,</v>

733
00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:16.340
<v Speaker 2>what's going on really is that your</v>
<v Speaker 2>cells are losing the ability to read the</v>

734
00:35:16.341 --> 00:35:18.950
<v Speaker 2>right genes the way they did when you</v>
<v Speaker 2>were 20.</v>

735
00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:24.450
<v Speaker 2>And that's basically noise informational</v>
<v Speaker 2>noise that gathers over time.</v>

736
00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:27.530
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so what we end up with when we're 80</v>

737
00:35:27.590 --> 00:35:32.000
<v Speaker 2>is a compact disc or DVD that scratched.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the reader cannot read the right</v>

738
00:35:32.001 --> 00:35:34.430
<v Speaker 2>genes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that right time in the cells become</v>

739
00:35:34.431 --> 00:35:37.620
<v Speaker 2>dysfunctional.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now what we're working on is highly that</v>

740
00:35:37.621 --> 00:35:41.040
<v Speaker 2>cd or that DVD to get that information</v>
<v Speaker 2>back again.</v>

741
00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:44.580
<v Speaker 2>And if you can do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's really the best way to</v>

742
00:35:44.581 --> 00:35:48.000
<v Speaker 2>reset your age.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we haven't published it yet,</v>

743
00:35:48.001 --> 00:35:50.610
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're working on ways to actually reset</v>

744
00:35:51.390 --> 00:35:55.470
<v Speaker 2>that genome and actually get back the</v>
<v Speaker 2>information that we once had when were</v>

745
00:35:55.471 --> 00:35:57.960
<v Speaker 2>20.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what is happening to the epigenome</v>

746
00:35:57.961 --> 00:35:59.190
<v Speaker 2>when you're going through those</v>
<v Speaker 2>scanners?</v>

747
00:35:59.790 --> 00:36:01.440
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what we found is the biggest</v>

748
00:36:01.441 --> 00:36:05.340
<v Speaker 2>disruptor of the epigenome is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a broken chromosome,</v>

749
00:36:05.730 --> 00:36:08.610
<v Speaker 2>DNA break,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't know about scanners,</v>

750
00:36:08.611 --> 00:36:10.440
<v Speaker 2>that's just an abundance of caution.</v>

751
00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:13.350
<v Speaker 2>But an x ray will damage your DNA.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No question.</v>

752
00:36:13.700 --> 00:36:16.770
<v Speaker 2>I'm even going out in the sun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will do a bit of that.</v>

753
00:36:17.190 --> 00:36:22.140
<v Speaker 2>And we think that the cells reaction to</v>
<v Speaker 2>that break having to unwrap the DNA from</v>

754
00:36:22.141 --> 00:36:24.480
<v Speaker 2>its Chromatin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we call it and uh,</v>

755
00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:29.450
<v Speaker 2>and then rewrap it is what eventually</v>
<v Speaker 2>disrupts the ability to read the right</v>

756
00:36:29.451 --> 00:36:33.210
<v Speaker 2>thing at the right place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Dna damage is essentially a little</v>

757
00:36:33.211 --> 00:36:35.100
<v Speaker 2>scratch on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the DVD.</v>

758
00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:39.170
<v Speaker 2>And that accumulates over time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So being out in the sun does that,</v>

759
00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:41.820
<v Speaker 2>but being out in the sun also is</v>
<v Speaker 2>beneficial.</v>

760
00:36:41.821 --> 00:36:44.700
<v Speaker 2>Your body produces more vitamin D.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

761
00:36:44.701 --> 00:36:46.230
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there's also a theory called</v>

762
00:36:46.260 --> 00:36:48.690
<v Speaker 2>antagonistic pleiotropy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is what's good for you when you're</v>

763
00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:50.610
<v Speaker 2>young.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Comes back to bite you when you're old,</v>

764
00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:54.390
<v Speaker 2>so you might look good and feel good and</v>
<v Speaker 2>get vitamin D when you're young.</v>

765
00:36:54.391 --> 00:36:59.010
<v Speaker 2>But the accumulation of these scratches</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the epigenome ends up.</v>

766
00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:01.440
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm formally in an Australian originally</v>

767
00:37:01.441 --> 00:37:03.540
<v Speaker 2>in Australia now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>American and Australian.</v>

768
00:37:04.050 --> 00:37:07.560
<v Speaker 2>I grew up in this straight and son.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I can tell you that,</v>

769
00:37:08.230 --> 00:37:10.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most Australians look older than they</v>

770
00:37:10.261 --> 00:37:15.261
<v Speaker 2>should know ozone now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ozone and lack of sunscreen in the 19</v>

771
00:37:15.301 --> 00:37:17.430
<v Speaker 2>seventies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do you guys have a whole nails on</v>

772
00:37:17.431 --> 00:37:19.140
<v Speaker 2>over Australia?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's that all about?</v>

773
00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:20.370
<v Speaker 2>What you do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

774
00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:22.650
<v Speaker 2>it's what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what did the world to chloroform Cognos</v>

775
00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:26.130
<v Speaker 2>to assure a well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hairspray.</v>

776
00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:29.150
<v Speaker 2>Why does it accumulate over Australia as</v>
<v Speaker 2>a theory?</v>

777
00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:33.230
<v Speaker 2>It started in Antarctica and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so ozone will.</v>

778
00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:35.030
<v Speaker 2>That had been convenient.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody's up there.</v>

779
00:37:35.090 --> 00:37:36.160
<v Speaker 2>Leave it up there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

780
00:37:36.161 --> 00:37:38.910
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you need to blow it that way.</v>

781
00:37:39.060 --> 00:37:40.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

782
00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:43.080
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the ozone layer is fairly</v>

783
00:37:43.081 --> 00:37:43.830
<v Speaker 2>important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

784
00:37:43.830 --> 00:37:45.810
<v Speaker 2>if you don't want to get singed by UV</v>
<v Speaker 2>light.</v>

785
00:37:46.530 --> 00:37:47.191
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

786
00:37:47.191 --> 00:37:50.310
<v Speaker 2>that's one of the first things I noticed</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I went to Australia was a,</v>

787
00:37:50.340 --> 00:37:54.270
<v Speaker 2>there's all these sun cancer warnings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>skin cancer warnings everywhere.</v>

788
00:37:54.750 --> 00:37:56.610
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a third of Australians get some form of</v>

789
00:37:56.640 --> 00:37:58.590
<v Speaker 2>skin cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's crazy.</v>

790
00:37:58.620 --> 00:38:00.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what's also gonna happen is it'll</v>

791
00:38:00.510 --> 00:38:02.970
<v Speaker 2>disrupt your epic genome over time and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll look old,</v>

792
00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:06.000
<v Speaker 2>but if you have an extra,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to damage your organs.</v>

793
00:38:06.001 --> 00:38:08.190
<v Speaker 2>You can accelerate aging,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe in your body.</v>

794
00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:09.570
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it happened.</v>

795
00:38:09.571 --> 00:38:12.660
<v Speaker 2>You can't avoid double strand breaks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cra broken chromosomes happens all the</v>

796
00:38:12.661 --> 00:38:14.760
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's trillions of cells in your body</v>

797
00:38:14.761 --> 00:38:17.670
<v Speaker 2>and it's happening all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So living is a problem.</v>

798
00:38:18.110 --> 00:38:19.230
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Flying,</v>

799
00:38:19.470 --> 00:38:23.880
<v Speaker 2>flying is even worse about what you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>working on is how do you get back that</v>

800
00:38:23.881 --> 00:38:26.970
<v Speaker 2>original information into the cell and</v>
<v Speaker 2>make a sell.</v>

801
00:38:27.450 --> 00:38:30.360
<v Speaker 2>Not just believe that it's 20 again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but actually be 20.</v>

802
00:38:31.020 --> 00:38:33.540
<v Speaker 2>So what do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We reprogram them.</v>

803
00:38:33.980 --> 00:38:38.980
<v Speaker 2>There are a set of genes that we and</v>
<v Speaker 2>others have found a three main ones that</v>

804
00:38:39.430 --> 00:38:42.760
<v Speaker 2>when you put them into a cell or even</v>
<v Speaker 2>into a mouse,</v>

805
00:38:43.460 --> 00:38:44.950
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they become younger again.</v>

806
00:38:45.610 --> 00:38:48.460
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How far do you think you are from</v>

807
00:38:48.461 --> 00:38:51.460
<v Speaker 2>implementing this on human beings as</v>
<v Speaker 2>well?</v>

808
00:38:51.461 --> 00:38:53.990
<v Speaker 2>So theoretically are you doing to</v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself and you could,</v>

809
00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:57.070
<v Speaker 2>you could do it to yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Theoretically I wouldn't do that because</v>

810
00:38:57.670 --> 00:39:00.250
<v Speaker 2>I'm not crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need to figure out the safety.</v>

811
00:39:00.310 --> 00:39:03.580
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to become a giant tumor</v>
<v Speaker 2>while we'll just use it on bad people.</v>

812
00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:05.080
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

813
00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:08.710
<v Speaker 2>Well that take people coming tournament</v>
<v Speaker 2>18 year olds and go,</v>

814
00:39:08.711 --> 00:39:09.730
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

815
00:39:10.210 --> 00:39:11.630
<v Speaker 2>Well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

816
00:39:11.631 --> 00:39:14.470
<v Speaker 2>that would be for someone else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone else.</v>

817
00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:16.360
<v Speaker 2>Well hopefully no one would ever do</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

818
00:39:16.420 --> 00:39:17.660
<v Speaker 2>Why not?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

819
00:39:17.830 --> 00:39:19.390
<v Speaker 2>what killed him?</v>
<v Speaker 2>His is what we're doing.</v>

820
00:39:19.720 --> 00:39:22.750
<v Speaker 2>I agree with you that we want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we want to see what happens in humans.</v>

821
00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:27.040
<v Speaker 2>Just give them like free pizza or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

822
00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:29.110
<v Speaker 2>They're on death row,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

823
00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:32.760
<v Speaker 2>If you're there already murders,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to be the first one to me on my</v>

824
00:39:33.100 --> 00:39:34.660
<v Speaker 2>death row,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to go into death row,</v>

825
00:39:35.050 --> 00:39:36.730
<v Speaker 2>but I'm saying if you're going to kill</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody,</v>

826
00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:39.580
<v Speaker 2>like wouldn't be a good idea to like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh hey,</v>

827
00:39:39.700 --> 00:39:42.100
<v Speaker 2>we'll give you a four hours of tv a day.</v>

828
00:39:42.580 --> 00:39:46.120
<v Speaker 2>So we want to shoot you up with some</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff's going to make a younger.</v>

829
00:39:46.610 --> 00:39:49.420
<v Speaker 2>If I was on death row and go do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See what's up.</v>

830
00:39:49.580 --> 00:39:51.620
<v Speaker 2>I'll watch TV.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

831
00:39:51.730 --> 00:39:56.500
<v Speaker 2>what we do is we give it all nice and we</v>
<v Speaker 2>check it.</v>

832
00:39:56.530 --> 00:39:59.740
<v Speaker 2>What happens to their body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So nursing home people to it,</v>

833
00:39:59.741 --> 00:40:00.770
<v Speaker 2>to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

834
00:40:00.850 --> 00:40:03.100
<v Speaker 2>Well tell you what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't force anyone,</v>

835
00:40:03.101 --> 00:40:08.101
<v Speaker 2>but if somebody was blind or almost</v>
<v Speaker 2>blind and now studies were recovering</v>

836
00:40:09.371 --> 00:40:10.660
<v Speaker 2>eyesight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

837
00:40:11.140 --> 00:40:13.010
<v Speaker 2>What about the damage to us?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

838
00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:14.153
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

839
00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:16.150
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I don't want to freak out because I</v>

840
00:40:16.151 --> 00:40:18.700
<v Speaker 2>know a guy who's got significantly</v>
<v Speaker 2>damaged,</v>

841
00:40:18.701 --> 00:40:21.530
<v Speaker 2>die from fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

842
00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:24.880
<v Speaker 2>I can tell you what we've done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is work with writing up for</v>

843
00:40:24.881 --> 00:40:27.460
<v Speaker 2>publication now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've done a few things.</v>

844
00:40:27.461 --> 00:40:29.560
<v Speaker 2>Three things to the mice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One is waived,</v>

845
00:40:29.561 --> 00:40:31.510
<v Speaker 2>pinched their optic nerve and crushed</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

846
00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:35.350
<v Speaker 2>which is a test for growing new neurons</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the eye.</v>

847
00:40:35.980 --> 00:40:40.140
<v Speaker 2>And we find that without reprogramming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can make the nerves be just like a</v>

848
00:40:40.150 --> 00:40:41.770
<v Speaker 2>newborn baby.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They grow back.</v>

849
00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:45.670
<v Speaker 2>And then we also tested on glaucoma</v>
<v Speaker 2>pressure in the eye.</v>

850
00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:49.870
<v Speaker 2>We increased pressure in the mouse as I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they lose their largely their</v>

851
00:40:49.890 --> 00:40:53.380
<v Speaker 2>eyesight and we can recover that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then we also test old mice that</v>

852
00:40:53.381 --> 00:40:56.860
<v Speaker 2>don't see very well and we also seem to</v>
<v Speaker 2>improve their eyesight almost back to</v>

853
00:40:56.861 --> 00:40:58.540
<v Speaker 2>normal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what,</v>

854
00:40:58.541 --> 00:41:00.940
<v Speaker 2>I don't think we'll be going into</v>
<v Speaker 2>nursing homes anytime soon,</v>

855
00:41:00.941 --> 00:41:04.120
<v Speaker 2>but what we are doing is running a</v>
<v Speaker 2>clinical trial on this.</v>

856
00:41:04.190 --> 00:41:06.460
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so we're looking to do that in early</v>

857
00:41:06.461 --> 00:41:10.810
<v Speaker 2>20 slash 20 and the clinical trial will</v>
<v Speaker 2>be on people with glaucoma or various</v>

858
00:41:10.811 --> 00:41:13.990
<v Speaker 2>eye issues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The plan is glaucoma first,</v>

859
00:41:14.350 --> 00:41:17.410
<v Speaker 2>but it could work for other damage</v>
<v Speaker 2>written as well.</v>

860
00:41:17.411 --> 00:41:20.110
<v Speaker 2>Even broken spinal cords where we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking of trying.</v>

861
00:41:20.350 --> 00:41:23.410
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's just one part of the body.</v>

862
00:41:23.860 --> 00:41:26.020
<v Speaker 2>Imagine what it could potentially do to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the rest of them.</v>

863
00:41:26.290 --> 00:41:29.020
<v Speaker 2>Do you feel incredibly fortunate to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>living in the century?</v>

864
00:41:30.150 --> 00:41:31.540
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do every day,</v>

865
00:41:31.570 --> 00:41:33.750
<v Speaker 2>but I would love to live next century</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's going to be.</v>

866
00:41:35.010 --> 00:41:35.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you're,</v>

867
00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:40.820
<v Speaker 1>what's cool is you're kind of at the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the tip of the spear pushing this stuff</v>

868
00:41:40.821 --> 00:41:43.400
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you're going to be one of the guys</v>

869
00:41:43.401 --> 00:41:46.820
<v Speaker 1>that gets to see this stuff get</v>
<v Speaker 1>implemented from your actual own</v>

870
00:41:46.821 --> 00:41:49.800
<v Speaker 1>research where it didn't exist before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

871
00:41:49.801 --> 00:41:51.110
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty damn cool.</v>

872
00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:54.650
<v Speaker 1>Better than like living 100 years from</v>
<v Speaker 1>now where you just take it for granted.</v>

873
00:41:54.651 --> 00:41:57.640
<v Speaker 1>Like a trust fund kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

874
00:41:57.980 --> 00:42:00.650
<v Speaker 1>But just imagine what you can do in 100</v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

875
00:42:00.651 --> 00:42:02.420
<v Speaker 1>You can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well maybe you'll be here.</v>

876
00:42:03.670 --> 00:42:05.600
<v Speaker 1>Were on the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

877
00:42:05.601 --> 00:42:07.840
<v Speaker 1>you might be 150.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll see.</v>

878
00:42:08.030 --> 00:42:09.620
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a chance someone will</v>
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>

879
00:42:09.770 --> 00:42:10.460
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

880
00:42:10.460 --> 00:42:13.760
<v Speaker 1>it's a good chance you're going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you're the one who's going to</v>

881
00:42:13.761 --> 00:42:15.190
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>

882
00:42:15.230 --> 00:42:17.030
<v Speaker 1>So here's my philosophy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not gonna.</v>

883
00:42:17.090 --> 00:42:20.330
<v Speaker 1>Let anyone try technology until I've</v>
<v Speaker 1>tried it first.</v>

884
00:42:20.540 --> 00:42:25.540
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is this a pause because you're,</v>

885
00:42:26.350 --> 00:42:27.860
<v Speaker 1>you're currently doing something like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

886
00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:30.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm not doing the three programming yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a little dangerous.</v>

887
00:42:30.771 --> 00:42:33.020
<v Speaker 1>But the others I've always wanted to</v>
<v Speaker 1>know first.</v>

888
00:42:33.140 --> 00:42:38.140
<v Speaker 1>My eyesight is starting to go because</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm 51 now and like when I had to read</v>

889
00:42:38.931 --> 00:42:42.410
<v Speaker 1>this book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got a Nick Christakis book from</v>

890
00:42:42.411 --> 00:42:45.410
<v Speaker 1>sitting here reading this book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I don't have reading glasses on,</v>

891
00:42:45.411 --> 00:42:48.800
<v Speaker 1>I got to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a bit of a struggle to be able to</v>

892
00:42:48.801 --> 00:42:52.010
<v Speaker 1>fix that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So potentially in the mice we can,</v>

893
00:42:52.490 --> 00:42:53.600
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we will.</v>

894
00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:56.120
<v Speaker 1>We don't give them books to read,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but their eyesight improves.</v>

895
00:42:56.150 --> 00:42:57.500
<v Speaker 1>We can test that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you do it?</v>

896
00:42:57.780 --> 00:42:59.780
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a moving screen.</v>

897
00:42:59.900 --> 00:43:00.321
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

898
00:43:00.321 --> 00:43:02.480
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean how do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you know,</v>

899
00:43:02.481 --> 00:43:04.670
<v Speaker 1>how do you test or not?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How you tests rather.</v>

900
00:43:04.671 --> 00:43:06.950
<v Speaker 1>How do you improve their eyesight?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

901
00:43:06.951 --> 00:43:09.020
<v Speaker 1>we've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we put these reprogramming genes into a</v>

902
00:43:09.021 --> 00:43:13.970
<v Speaker 1>virus which has already used to treat</v>
<v Speaker 1>genetic diseases in the eye and we</v>

903
00:43:13.971 --> 00:43:15.800
<v Speaker 1>inject it straight into the master's</v>
<v Speaker 1>level.</v>

904
00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:18.140
<v Speaker 1>This sounds like the beginning of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>horror movie.</v>

905
00:43:19.730 --> 00:43:22.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's actually an awesome movie.</v>

906
00:43:22.580 --> 00:43:24.500
<v Speaker 1>It's the awesome part that I'm focused</v>
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

907
00:43:24.530 --> 00:43:25.730
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're going blind,</v>

908
00:43:25.790 --> 00:43:28.130
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>One injection from your doctor and then</v>

909
00:43:28.131 --> 00:43:30.500
<v Speaker 1>you take an antibiotic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>turn the genes on for as long as you</v>

910
00:43:30.501 --> 00:43:34.280
<v Speaker 1>need and you get your eyesight back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not horrific at all.</v>

911
00:43:34.340 --> 00:43:37.020
<v Speaker 1>That's a pretty incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How far away do you think you are of</v>

912
00:43:37.021 --> 00:43:38.890
<v Speaker 1>doing that to humans?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

913
00:43:39.410 --> 00:43:41.970
<v Speaker 1>20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 will be the first safety study we.</v>

914
00:43:42.170 --> 00:43:44.210
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

915
00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:45.560
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the crazy stuff,</v>

916
00:43:45.561 --> 00:43:49.400
<v Speaker 1>the future is if this all goes well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have an injection in your vein,</v>

917
00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:53.480
<v Speaker 1>let's say when you're 30 and in those</v>
<v Speaker 1>viruses infect your body and they sit</v>

918
00:43:53.481 --> 00:43:56.450
<v Speaker 1>there dormant until you need them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so when might you need them?</v>

919
00:43:56.510 --> 00:43:59.000
<v Speaker 1>You might have a car accident turned</v>
<v Speaker 1>them on,</v>

920
00:43:59.390 --> 00:44:03.410
<v Speaker 1>can turn them on with just a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an antibiotic in a drip or a pill,</v>

921
00:44:03.950 --> 00:44:06.160
<v Speaker 1>or you start to lose your eyesight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take it,</v>

922
00:44:06.310 --> 00:44:07.143
<v Speaker 1>take an antibiotic.</v>

923
00:44:07.490 --> 00:44:12.110
<v Speaker 1>So you put them in your body almost as</v>
<v Speaker 1>an insurance policy and then you have</v>

924
00:44:12.111 --> 00:44:13.760
<v Speaker 1>the option to turn them on in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>

925
00:44:13.790 --> 00:44:15.320
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

926
00:44:15.640 --> 00:44:19.520
<v Speaker 1>That's what we do in the mice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now with every action,</v>

927
00:44:20.030 --> 00:44:25.030
<v Speaker 1>we assume there's some negative</v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence or potentially negative</v>

928
00:44:26.991 --> 00:44:27.920
<v Speaker 1>consequence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

929
00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:31.830
<v Speaker 1>We always assume that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not always right.</v>

930
00:44:32.540 --> 00:44:35.390
<v Speaker 1>So with the molecules that we've been</v>
<v Speaker 1>testing for years now,</v>

931
00:44:35.391 --> 00:44:37.110
<v Speaker 1>like can a man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we haven't seen any downside,</v>

932
00:44:37.111 --> 00:44:41.100
<v Speaker 1>just longer endurance and protection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there isn't always a downside to</v>

933
00:44:41.101 --> 00:44:41.940
<v Speaker 1>these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

934
00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:45.840
<v Speaker 1>if you just think nmn is replacing a</v>
<v Speaker 1>molecule that we lose over time as we</v>

935
00:44:45.841 --> 00:44:48.060
<v Speaker 1>get older,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just becoming,</v>

936
00:44:48.090 --> 00:44:49.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fairly natural process.</v>

937
00:44:49.710 --> 00:44:51.840
<v Speaker 1>No downside exercising and dieting</v>
<v Speaker 1>either.</v>

938
00:44:52.950 --> 00:44:54.060
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>

939
00:44:54.090 --> 00:44:56.660
<v Speaker 1>And you said you run once a week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that what you,</v>

940
00:44:57.090 --> 00:44:59.700
<v Speaker 1>you and you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you lift weights as well?</v>

941
00:44:59.730 --> 00:45:01.530
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you do it,</v>

942
00:45:01.531 --> 00:45:05.820
<v Speaker 1>do try to not go too hard or burn</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself out too much?</v>

943
00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:08.790
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you have a sweet spot?</v>

944
00:45:09.210 --> 00:45:10.043
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

945
00:45:10.980 --> 00:45:11.880
<v Speaker 1>I do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do,</v>

946
00:45:11.881 --> 00:45:15.600
<v Speaker 1>I try not to go too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I that that's the trick with everything</v>

947
00:45:15.601 --> 00:45:17.340
<v Speaker 1>in life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's this,</v>

948
00:45:17.341 --> 00:45:18.360
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hormesis effect.</v>

949
00:45:18.361 --> 00:45:22.080
<v Speaker 1>Get your body damaged enough that it can</v>
<v Speaker 1>repair itself,</v>

950
00:45:22.081 --> 00:45:27.081
<v Speaker 1>but give you the benefits without like</v>
<v Speaker 1>having a lot of x rays or radiation.</v>

951
00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:30.230
<v Speaker 1>We're doing it and scratching that CD.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

952
00:45:30.280 --> 00:45:33.300
<v Speaker 1>My,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's always my thought on people that</v>

953
00:45:33.930 --> 00:45:38.790
<v Speaker 1>do extreme endurance activities like</v>
<v Speaker 1>ultra marathons and things along those</v>

954
00:45:38.791 --> 00:45:39.880
<v Speaker 1>lines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

955
00:45:39.930 --> 00:45:44.790
<v Speaker 1>I mean I marvel at their willpower and</v>
<v Speaker 1>their ability to push themselves through</v>

956
00:45:44.791 --> 00:45:49.350
<v Speaker 1>that and the physical condition they</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to be in to perform such feats.</v>

957
00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:50.820
<v Speaker 1>But I always think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

958
00:45:50.821 --> 00:45:55.821
<v Speaker 1>you're probably doing x times the amount</v>
<v Speaker 1>of damage to your body that a normal</v>

959
00:45:56.581 --> 00:45:58.260
<v Speaker 1>person does at your age.</v>

960
00:45:58.710 --> 00:46:00.480
<v Speaker 1>It sounds right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Calorie restriction works,</v>

961
00:46:00.481 --> 00:46:02.900
<v Speaker 1>but if you overdo it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you also starve you.</v>

962
00:46:02.930 --> 00:46:03.601
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You Die.</v>

963
00:46:03.601 --> 00:46:05.880
<v Speaker 1>So you gotta find the right balance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

964
00:46:05.970 --> 00:46:06.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you,</v>

965
00:46:07.110 --> 00:46:09.120
<v Speaker 1>how do you know what the right balance</v>
<v Speaker 1>is for you?</v>

966
00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:11.640
<v Speaker 1>Good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How does anybody,</v>

967
00:46:11.700 --> 00:46:13.620
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we live in an age that is still</v>

968
00:46:13.650 --> 00:46:15.690
<v Speaker 1>fairly primitive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is why I liked the future.</v>

969
00:46:16.170 --> 00:46:18.720
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these days we go to the doctor or most</v>

970
00:46:18.721 --> 00:46:21.180
<v Speaker 1>of us go to the doctor for annual</v>
<v Speaker 1>physical,</v>

971
00:46:21.210 --> 00:46:24.520
<v Speaker 1>which is ludicrous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea that your doctor will take</v>

972
00:46:24.930 --> 00:46:28.110
<v Speaker 1>hopefully a blood test,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a prostate exam once a year.</v>

973
00:46:28.111 --> 00:46:30.420
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens if you've got a tumor that</v>

974
00:46:30.421 --> 00:46:32.970
<v Speaker 1>developed the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you leave the doctor's office.</v>

975
00:46:33.510 --> 00:46:36.210
<v Speaker 1>So the future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and actually partially for those who are</v>

976
00:46:36.211 --> 00:46:38.100
<v Speaker 1>on the cutting edge can be done right</v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

977
00:46:38.670 --> 00:46:43.650
<v Speaker 1>It's monitoring your body in various</v>
<v Speaker 1>ways genetically,</v>

978
00:46:43.950 --> 00:46:44.910
<v Speaker 1>epigenetically.</v>

979
00:46:45.030 --> 00:46:46.680
<v Speaker 1>We can measure those scratches right</v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

980
00:46:47.070 --> 00:46:52.070
<v Speaker 1>And also with blood tests,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can also have companies tell you if</v>

981
00:46:52.441 --> 00:46:55.200
<v Speaker 1>you're out of range,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're not optimized and how to get</v>

982
00:46:55.201 --> 00:46:57.210
<v Speaker 1>it back in order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's what I do.</v>

983
00:46:57.660 --> 00:46:59.820
<v Speaker 1>So how often do you monitor your blood?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

984
00:47:00.060 --> 00:47:03.720
<v Speaker 1>probably every few months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a blood test from a company that</v>

985
00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:07.770
<v Speaker 1>tells me what I need to correct and how</v>
<v Speaker 1>extensive it is.</v>

986
00:47:07.820 --> 00:47:10.710
<v Speaker 1>Is this blood test like because it the</v>
<v Speaker 1>standard one that a normal person can</v>

987
00:47:10.711 --> 00:47:12.660
<v Speaker 1>get or do you have to have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>prescription to get this or.</v>

988
00:47:12.750 --> 00:47:14.310
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can go online and get it.</v>

989
00:47:14.440 --> 00:47:15.240
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's uh,</v>

990
00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:18.810
<v Speaker 1>about I think 40 parameters they measure</v>
<v Speaker 1>some that are not standard that you're</v>

991
00:47:18.811 --> 00:47:20.460
<v Speaker 1>Dr wouldn't do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some are pretty standard.</v>

992
00:47:21.180 --> 00:47:22.440
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what's nice is it's,</v>

993
00:47:22.650 --> 00:47:25.050
<v Speaker 1>it's a tracking system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's called inside tracker and they,</v>

994
00:47:25.720 --> 00:47:28.680
<v Speaker 1>you can see over time if things are</v>
<v Speaker 1>going up and even if they're not out of</v>

995
00:47:28.681 --> 00:47:30.310
<v Speaker 1>range yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see if they headed that</v>

996
00:47:30.311 --> 00:47:31.990
<v Speaker 1>direction and correct it before it's too</v>
<v Speaker 1>late.</v>

997
00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:34.600
<v Speaker 1>So that's why one of the reasons I'm on</v>
<v Speaker 1>Metformin,</v>

998
00:47:34.601 --> 00:47:36.250
<v Speaker 1>my blood glucose was going up and up and</v>
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>

999
00:47:36.550 --> 00:47:41.550
<v Speaker 1>which predicts lower life and some</v>
<v Speaker 1>metformin got it back down to where it</v>

1000
00:47:42.121 --> 00:47:43.840
<v Speaker 1>was optimal again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's one of the things that</v>

1001
00:47:43.841 --> 00:47:46.060
<v Speaker 1>metformin does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it lowers your blood glucose.</v>

1002
00:47:46.270 --> 00:47:48.160
<v Speaker 1>That's what it's prescribed for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for diabetics.</v>

1003
00:47:49.240 --> 00:47:50.950
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does that have any effect on your energy</v>

1004
00:47:50.951 --> 00:47:52.660
<v Speaker 1>levels?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1005
00:47:52.730 --> 00:47:54.490
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't noticed that.</v>

1006
00:47:57.530 --> 00:48:00.370
<v Speaker 1>Where you would notice it is during</v>
<v Speaker 1>rigorous exercise.</v>

1007
00:48:00.820 --> 00:48:02.500
<v Speaker 1>That makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you feel it?</v>

1008
00:48:03.630 --> 00:48:04.180
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1009
00:48:04.180 --> 00:48:06.380
<v Speaker 1>so I take metformin at night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1010
00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:09.550
<v Speaker 1>so that may be probably the best thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1011
00:48:09.551 --> 00:48:12.610
<v Speaker 1>So when you're sleeping it's having its</v>
<v Speaker 1>effect and it's run its course by the</v>

1012
00:48:12.611 --> 00:48:13.570
<v Speaker 1>time you wake up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you believe?</v>

1013
00:48:13.730 --> 00:48:14.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

1014
00:48:15.020 --> 00:48:17.410
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now when you are exercising,</v>

1015
00:48:17.411 --> 00:48:21.730
<v Speaker 1>are you exercising fasted or do you take</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain amount of carbohydrates for you?</v>

1016
00:48:21.880 --> 00:48:24.310
<v Speaker 1>Do any kind of physical exercise?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1017
00:48:24.311 --> 00:48:25.560
<v Speaker 1>so I started the gym,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1018
00:48:25.650 --> 00:48:28.130
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2:00 PM on a Sunday and I'll have a</v>

1019
00:48:28.420 --> 00:48:32.640
<v Speaker 1>salad rapper or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm not feeling hungry during it and</v>

1020
00:48:32.790 --> 00:48:34.630
<v Speaker 1>one pass out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

1021
00:48:35.530 --> 00:48:39.040
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I understand that you're getting</v>

1022
00:48:39.041 --> 00:48:41.860
<v Speaker 1>these blood tests,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but do you have a trainer?</v>

1023
00:48:41.890 --> 00:48:45.310
<v Speaker 1>Do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you set a workout or you structure</v>

1024
00:48:45.311 --> 00:48:46.660
<v Speaker 1>it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do now.</v>

1025
00:48:46.720 --> 00:48:48.760
<v Speaker 1>Just recently got a trainer.</v>

1026
00:48:49.260 --> 00:48:51.100
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's great thing to do with your son,</v>

1027
00:48:52.320 --> 00:48:53.170
<v Speaker 1>father,</v>
<v Speaker 1>son time.</v>

1028
00:48:53.740 --> 00:48:55.660
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we have an hour of trainer and then</v>

1029
00:48:55.661 --> 00:48:57.640
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we also do a bit of boxing.</v>

1030
00:48:57.960 --> 00:49:00.120
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're beating yourself up.</v>

1031
00:49:00.220 --> 00:49:01.053
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fun.</v>

1032
00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:05.390
<v Speaker 1>It's legal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think go to the sauna and then there's</v>

1033
00:49:05.410 --> 00:49:08.320
<v Speaker 1>just the best way to spend a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is a nice way to spend a day.</v>

1034
00:49:08.500 --> 00:49:12.090
<v Speaker 1>So I'm a you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many days a week you're doing this</v>

1035
00:49:12.091 --> 00:49:14.140
<v Speaker 1>or do you give yourself days off?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you,</v>

1036
00:49:14.650 --> 00:49:16.170
<v Speaker 1>you schedule that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1037
00:49:16.240 --> 00:49:20.560
<v Speaker 1>so once a day of that are once a week on</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Sunday and during the week if I have a</v>

1038
00:49:20.561 --> 00:49:22.900
<v Speaker 1>chance and I'm not traveling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go to the home gym.</v>

1039
00:49:23.620 --> 00:49:27.160
<v Speaker 1>And when you say you run once a week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that by design that you only give</v>

1040
00:49:27.161 --> 00:49:30.190
<v Speaker 1>yourself once a week?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd probably run two times a week.</v>

1041
00:49:30.250 --> 00:49:31.640
<v Speaker 1>A high intensity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1042
00:49:32.560 --> 00:49:35.530
<v Speaker 1>if I could.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I try to do that often I'm on a</v>

1043
00:49:35.540 --> 00:49:38.920
<v Speaker 1>plane or right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we say high intensity or you</v>

1044
00:49:38.921 --> 00:49:41.650
<v Speaker 1>sprinting doing track work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what kind of stuff?</v>

1045
00:49:42.340 --> 00:49:43.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm not an expert,</v>

1046
00:49:43.900 --> 00:49:47.560
<v Speaker 1>so what I do is I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will spend or have spent a half an</v>

1047
00:49:47.561 --> 00:49:50.230
<v Speaker 1>hour on one of those treadmills that's u</v>
<v Speaker 1>shaped.</v>

1048
00:49:50.880 --> 00:49:51.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got one of those out of here.</v>

1049
00:49:51.970 --> 00:49:52.803
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>

1050
00:49:52.870 --> 00:49:54.520
<v Speaker 1>They are so that you determine your</v>
<v Speaker 1>speed.</v>

1051
00:49:54.521 --> 00:49:56.340
<v Speaker 1>So I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll sprint and then I'll slow down and</v>

1052
00:49:56.341 --> 00:49:58.720
<v Speaker 1>sprint slow down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are actually more difficult than</v>

1053
00:49:58.721 --> 00:50:03.490
<v Speaker 1>running on a flat surface where a</v>
<v Speaker 1>regular treadmills is actually easier</v>

1054
00:50:03.491 --> 00:50:06.220
<v Speaker 1>than running because the treadmills</v>
<v Speaker 1>moving and you just kind of lifting your</v>

1055
00:50:06.221 --> 00:50:09.310
<v Speaker 1>legs up and keeping moving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>With this actually you're powering it.</v>

1056
00:50:09.910 --> 00:50:13.270
<v Speaker 1>So by you pushing on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's actually more.</v>

1057
00:50:13.300 --> 00:50:14.230
<v Speaker 1>It's like running.</v>

1058
00:50:14.620 --> 00:50:17.800
<v Speaker 1>I forget what the degree incline is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's like an x,</v>

1059
00:50:18.070 --> 00:50:20.110
<v Speaker 1>x amount percentage harder than a</v>
<v Speaker 1>regular run.</v>

1060
00:50:20.290 --> 00:50:22.690
<v Speaker 1>Oh good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's what feels good to me.</v>

1061
00:50:23.050 --> 00:50:26.410
<v Speaker 1>And although it's a little bit scary if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not used to these treadmills,</v>

1062
00:50:26.411 --> 00:50:28.910
<v Speaker 1>you can run off the front because they</v>
<v Speaker 1>are free flowing.</v>

1063
00:50:29.450 --> 00:50:31.880
<v Speaker 1>Go right off the tip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have handles.</v>

1064
00:50:32.680 --> 00:50:33.950
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a genius.</v>

1065
00:50:33.951 --> 00:50:36.050
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to go flying off the</v>
<v Speaker 1>treadmill like a dummy.</v>

1066
00:50:36.080 --> 00:50:38.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm no genius.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially when it comes to sport.</v>

1067
00:50:39.560 --> 00:50:40.460
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1068
00:50:41.900 --> 00:50:44.450
<v Speaker 1>the album,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a big fan of those things and it's</v>

1069
00:50:44.451 --> 00:50:46.850
<v Speaker 1>nice too because there's a lot of give</v>
<v Speaker 1>to them.</v>

1070
00:50:46.910 --> 00:50:49.070
<v Speaker 1>There's not much pounding when you run</v>
<v Speaker 1>on those.</v>

1071
00:50:49.071 --> 00:50:52.670
<v Speaker 1>It's not like running on hard surfaces.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I try to go easy on my joints.</v>

1072
00:50:52.671 --> 00:50:57.671
<v Speaker 1>I've seen you've probably all seen</v>
<v Speaker 1>sports players with all sorts of damage</v>

1073
00:50:58.121 --> 00:51:00.260
<v Speaker 1>that joints and I've done all of it.</v>

1074
00:51:00.380 --> 00:51:01.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1075
00:51:01.221 --> 00:51:03.230
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>low impact,</v>

1076
00:51:03.290 --> 00:51:06.970
<v Speaker 1>high intensity and it as far as weight</v>
<v Speaker 1>lifting,</v>

1077
00:51:06.971 --> 00:51:09.620
<v Speaker 1>we will kind of stuff you do in there</v>
<v Speaker 1>because weightlifting does have a</v>

1078
00:51:09.650 --> 00:51:14.650
<v Speaker 1>beneficial effect on bone density and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's supposedly has an effect on anti</v>

1079
00:51:14.991 --> 00:51:16.540
<v Speaker 1>aging as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1080
00:51:16.770 --> 00:51:19.400
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely believe in that until I try</v>

1081
00:51:19.401 --> 00:51:23.030
<v Speaker 1>to maintain some muscle mass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's good for burning fat too.</v>

1082
00:51:23.600 --> 00:51:24.380
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1083
00:51:24.380 --> 00:51:28.670
<v Speaker 1>I tried to do a not go overboard with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bench presses and otherwise I'll</v>

1084
00:51:28.820 --> 00:51:31.910
<v Speaker 1>have even more well rounded shoulders</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to get the straight back.</v>

1085
00:51:31.911 --> 00:51:34.640
<v Speaker 1>So the trainer is helping me bring my</v>
<v Speaker 1>body back into shape.</v>

1086
00:51:35.180 --> 00:51:37.660
<v Speaker 1>He took one look at me and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1087
00:51:37.690 --> 00:51:41.270
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you did this unsupervised direct your</v>

1088
00:51:41.271 --> 00:51:42.980
<v Speaker 1>body in your twenties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's try to fix that.</v>

1089
00:51:43.220 --> 00:51:45.610
<v Speaker 1>What did he say you were doing wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1090
00:51:45.770 --> 00:51:46.281
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1091
00:51:46.281 --> 00:51:48.680
<v Speaker 1>why would you do an exercise and a part</v>
<v Speaker 1>of your body you can't see in the</v>

1092
00:51:48.681 --> 00:51:49.040
<v Speaker 1>mirror?</v>

1093
00:51:49.040 --> 00:51:49.873
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your back.</v>

1094
00:51:50.090 --> 00:51:53.300
<v Speaker 1>My back is flimsy and it's all here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I stand like,</v>

1095
00:51:53.301 --> 00:51:56.270
<v Speaker 1>you're a smart man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's protecting your spine.</v>

1096
00:51:57.080 --> 00:51:58.970
<v Speaker 1>I love benchpressing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh God.</v>

1097
00:51:59.650 --> 00:52:03.230
<v Speaker 1>Please don't use</v>
<v Speaker 1>your shoulders out too though,</v>

1098
00:52:03.231 --> 00:52:04.370
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1099
00:52:04.520 --> 00:52:06.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially if you do it heavy.</v>

1100
00:52:06.770 --> 00:52:09.290
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm you do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many days a week?</v>

1101
00:52:10.640 --> 00:52:12.650
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully two or three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two or three a week.</v>

1102
00:52:12.830 --> 00:52:15.260
<v Speaker 1>So all the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything you're doing you would</v>

1103
00:52:15.261 --> 00:52:17.180
<v Speaker 1>essentially recommend to others as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1104
00:52:17.450 --> 00:52:20.090
<v Speaker 1>So you think that's a good plan?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two to three days a week of</v>

1105
00:52:20.091 --> 00:52:21.410
<v Speaker 1>weightlifting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One to two days.</v>

1106
00:52:21.411 --> 00:52:26.411
<v Speaker 1>A week of running sauna when you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I never used the word recommend gets</v>

1107
00:52:27.681 --> 00:52:28.491
<v Speaker 1>me into trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1108
00:52:28.491 --> 00:52:30.620
<v Speaker 1>good move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just say what I do and people can</v>

1109
00:52:30.621 --> 00:52:34.190
<v Speaker 1>judge but as smart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the science does say this is the</v>

1110
00:52:34.191 --> 00:52:36.680
<v Speaker 1>optimal and that's why I've chosen it</v>
<v Speaker 1>for myself,</v>

1111
00:52:37.480 --> 00:52:41.750
<v Speaker 1>but I think without monitoring yourself</v>
<v Speaker 1>easy to overdo it and also you just</v>

1112
00:52:41.900 --> 00:52:43.400
<v Speaker 1>really don't know what's going on in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>inside.</v>

1113
00:52:43.790 --> 00:52:48.110
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy to think we know more about</v>
<v Speaker 1>our cars as we drive on the dashboard</v>

1114
00:52:48.111 --> 00:52:51.360
<v Speaker 1>then we do about our bodies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How does anybody know if the exercises</v>

1115
00:52:51.380 --> 00:52:53.780
<v Speaker 1>too much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>too little or if that supplements doing</v>

1116
00:52:53.781 --> 00:52:56.570
<v Speaker 1>anything right with that is a big</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

1117
00:52:56.571 --> 00:52:58.560
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean one of the things that we have a</v>

1118
00:52:58.640 --> 00:53:01.670
<v Speaker 1>giant problem in mma is tainted</v>
<v Speaker 1>supplements.</v>

1119
00:53:02.660 --> 00:53:05.510
<v Speaker 1>People buying supplements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The supplements have other things in</v>

1120
00:53:05.511 --> 00:53:06.344
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

1121
00:53:07.580 --> 00:53:11.840
<v Speaker 1>what are you drinking?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you drink mostly water to consume</v>

1122
00:53:11.841 --> 00:53:13.790
<v Speaker 1>caffeine?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1123
00:53:13.791 --> 00:53:16.430
<v Speaker 1>so with Nmn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which gives me a boost,</v>

1124
00:53:16.520 --> 00:53:18.960
<v Speaker 1>I think caffeine is a little too</v>
<v Speaker 1>intense,</v>

1125
00:53:18.961 --> 00:53:23.090
<v Speaker 1>so I find that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'll have a cup of coffee in the</v>

1126
00:53:23.091 --> 00:53:25.380
<v Speaker 1>morning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's it one a day.</v>

1127
00:53:25.950 --> 00:53:26.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1128
00:53:26.460 --> 00:53:27.241
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1129
00:53:27.241 --> 00:53:29.610
<v Speaker 3>Just to kick it to live,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's hard.</v>

1130
00:53:29.790 --> 00:53:31.750
<v Speaker 3>It's really hard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1131
00:53:31.950 --> 00:53:34.890
<v Speaker 3>When you're doing research all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't you need a little boost sometimes?</v>

1132
00:53:34.950 --> 00:53:35.560
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1133
00:53:35.560 --> 00:53:40.560
<v Speaker 3>I do drink a diet coke or how dare you</v>
<v Speaker 3>just ruined everything.</v>

1134
00:53:40.891 --> 00:53:42.870
<v Speaker 3>You said you're doing that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1135
00:53:42.871 --> 00:53:45.880
<v Speaker 3>It's my fucking horrible for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it that bad?</v>

1136
00:53:45.970 --> 00:53:47.010
<v Speaker 3>Aspartame?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1137
00:53:47.700 --> 00:53:52.700
<v Speaker 3>I actually had an inflated idea of how</v>
<v Speaker 3>bad it was apparently talking to another</v>

1138
00:53:53.731 --> 00:53:55.710
<v Speaker 3>research scientist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1139
00:53:55.711 --> 00:54:00.711
<v Speaker 3>he was telling me that the actual amount</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they gave to rats when they're</v>

1140
00:54:01.710 --> 00:54:06.710
<v Speaker 3>diagnosing them with cancer is almost</v>
<v Speaker 3>impossible for a person to consume.</v>

1141
00:54:07.970 --> 00:54:12.300
<v Speaker 3>So you'd have to have ungodly amounts of</v>
<v Speaker 3>aspartame in order to get these effects</v>

1142
00:54:12.301 --> 00:54:14.730
<v Speaker 3>that everyone's terrified of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You said the other thing to take into</v>

1143
00:54:14.731 --> 00:54:18.510
<v Speaker 3>consideration is look around at how many</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are drinking diet coke?</v>

1144
00:54:18.840 --> 00:54:20.190
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was really that bad.</v>

1145
00:54:20.191 --> 00:54:24.840
<v Speaker 3>They'd be dropping like flies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The consideration though is upsetting</v>

1146
00:54:24.841 --> 00:54:27.080
<v Speaker 3>your gut biome,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1147
00:54:27.360 --> 00:54:28.890
<v Speaker 3>That I know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or at least I've read,</v>

1148
00:54:28.950 --> 00:54:32.100
<v Speaker 3>but he said that's also probably large</v>
<v Speaker 3>quantities.</v>

1149
00:54:33.520 --> 00:54:35.070
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's true.</v>

1150
00:54:35.180 --> 00:54:35.701
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1151
00:54:35.701 --> 00:54:36.271
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you know,</v>

1152
00:54:36.271 --> 00:54:39.540
<v Speaker 2>the microbiome is a finicky thing and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to mess with that.</v>

1153
00:54:39.570 --> 00:54:41.730
<v Speaker 2>The reason I have this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this yoga in the morning,</v>

1154
00:54:41.731 --> 00:54:43.930
<v Speaker 2>trying to reset the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>D,</v>

1155
00:54:44.070 --> 00:54:45.520
<v Speaker 2>Kim all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1156
00:54:45.540 --> 00:54:46.710
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not regularly,</v>

1157
00:54:46.711 --> 00:54:47.540
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

1158
00:54:47.540 --> 00:54:48.130
<v Speaker 2>that's</v>

1159
00:54:48.130 --> 00:54:51.430
<v Speaker 3>what about other fermented vegetables or</v>
<v Speaker 3>anything along those lines.</v>

1160
00:54:51.750 --> 00:54:52.600
<v Speaker 3>The probiotic</v>

1161
00:54:52.780 --> 00:54:57.240
<v Speaker 2>Japanese food into.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I don't think about my diet that</v>

1162
00:54:57.241 --> 00:55:00.030
<v Speaker 2>often.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Usually too busy running around.</v>

1163
00:55:00.031 --> 00:55:00.750
<v Speaker 2>But</v>

1164
00:55:00.750 --> 00:55:04.140
<v Speaker 3>now have you ever messed around with</v>
<v Speaker 3>nootropics or anything like that to</v>

1165
00:55:04.380 --> 00:55:08.250
<v Speaker 3>enhance your mental clarity or boost</v>
<v Speaker 3>your brain power?</v>

1166
00:55:09.340 --> 00:55:10.730
<v Speaker 2>W?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1167
00:55:11.270 --> 00:55:11.600
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My,</v>

1168
00:55:11.600 --> 00:55:14.130
<v Speaker 2>my brain is always running a marathon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1169
00:55:14.131 --> 00:55:17.610
<v Speaker 2>That's my career.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I definitely noticed that if I take time</v>

1170
00:55:17.611 --> 00:55:21.420
<v Speaker 2>off even a weekend without thinking I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>dumber on Monday,</v>

1171
00:55:21.900 --> 00:55:23.250
<v Speaker 2>dumber.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well yeah,</v>

1172
00:55:23.251 --> 00:55:26.190
<v Speaker 2>I just can't really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like it's almost like you need to</v>

1173
00:55:26.191 --> 00:55:29.180
<v Speaker 2>keep that pace going for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1174
00:55:29.250 --> 00:55:30.083
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1175
00:55:30.190 --> 00:55:33.840
<v Speaker 2>I guess I'm not a natural genius.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to work at it,</v>

1176
00:55:34.800 --> 00:55:37.050
<v Speaker 2>but I do find that that constant</v>
<v Speaker 2>stimulation,</v>

1177
00:55:37.051 --> 00:55:39.990
<v Speaker 2>I've got to do that to be at the peak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is the APP.</v>

1178
00:55:40.050 --> 00:55:43.530
<v Speaker 2>This is the genetics department at</v>
<v Speaker 2>Harvard medical school and these are no</v>

1179
00:55:43.531 --> 00:55:44.090
<v Speaker 2>dummies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These,</v>

1180
00:55:44.090 --> 00:55:46.160
<v Speaker 2>a quarter of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a Nobel prize winners.</v>

1181
00:55:46.290 --> 00:55:48.510
<v Speaker 2>And you got to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to load the science,</v>

1182
00:55:48.511 --> 00:55:52.260
<v Speaker 2>we published the world's top journals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which you really get into,</v>

1183
00:55:52.460 --> 00:55:56.430
<v Speaker 2>so to be able to think of these ideas</v>
<v Speaker 2>and come up with new things,</v>

1184
00:55:57.130 --> 00:55:59.370
<v Speaker 2>you can't just do that on a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on a whim.</v>

1185
00:55:59.371 --> 00:56:03.360
<v Speaker 2>You really have to have a mind that is</v>
<v Speaker 2>focused and in shape.</v>

1186
00:56:03.660 --> 00:56:04.560
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1187
00:56:04.561 --> 00:56:06.720
<v Speaker 2>So it is essentially you feel like</v>
<v Speaker 2>running,</v>

1188
00:56:06.930 --> 00:56:09.600
<v Speaker 2>like you would take days off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He actually slipped back a little bit</v>

1189
00:56:09.601 --> 00:56:11.100
<v Speaker 2>and then you have to ramp back up to</v>
<v Speaker 2>speed.</v>

1190
00:56:11.101 --> 00:56:12.840
<v Speaker 2>It's horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really hate it.</v>

1191
00:56:13.560 --> 00:56:17.490
<v Speaker 2>But is it just because you just get used</v>
<v Speaker 2>to a lazy pace and you have to like</v>

1192
00:56:17.760 --> 00:56:21.870
<v Speaker 2>acclimate to get back in the lab or is</v>
<v Speaker 2>it actually you do get dumber?</v>

1193
00:56:22.440 --> 00:56:24.310
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have the memory recall.</v>

1194
00:56:24.360 --> 00:56:24.910
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1195
00:56:24.910 --> 00:56:29.180
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I did when I was in my</v>
<v Speaker 1>twenties,</v>

1196
00:56:29.181 --> 00:56:32.230
<v Speaker 1>which is I wasn't as sharp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a lot sharper than I was then.</v>

1197
00:56:32.590 --> 00:56:36.250
<v Speaker 1>So part of it could be the mental</v>
<v Speaker 1>training that I give myself every,</v>

1198
00:56:36.540 --> 00:56:38.920
<v Speaker 1>every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other part could be that the</v>

1199
00:56:38.921 --> 00:56:43.390
<v Speaker 1>molecules that I'm taking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so nmn raising nad could have neurotoxic</v>

1200
00:56:43.391 --> 00:56:44.440
<v Speaker 1>effects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't know.</v>

1201
00:56:44.530 --> 00:56:47.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure I'm creatine supposedly has</v>

1202
00:56:47.021 --> 00:56:49.120
<v Speaker 1>nootropic effects as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever take that?</v>

1203
00:56:49.820 --> 00:56:53.020
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Caffeine certainly does.</v>

1204
00:56:53.260 --> 00:56:55.150
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to get you some actual</v>
<v Speaker 1>nootropics.</v>

1205
00:56:55.210 --> 00:56:57.460
<v Speaker 1>I'll send you some.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a bunch of different ones that I</v>

1206
00:56:57.461 --> 00:56:59.740
<v Speaker 1>use.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I use three different companies.</v>

1207
00:56:59.741 --> 00:57:02.500
<v Speaker 1>One that's one of mine and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the other companies,</v>

1208
00:57:02.501 --> 00:57:06.760
<v Speaker 1>neuro one and another one called true</v>
<v Speaker 1>brain and I find them pretty beneficial.</v>

1209
00:57:07.400 --> 00:57:08.500
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could do with that.</v>

1210
00:57:08.740 --> 00:57:09.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1211
00:57:09.390 --> 00:57:10.660
<v Speaker 1>it'll definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1212
00:57:11.100 --> 00:57:13.240
<v Speaker 1>the one that we've tested was Alpha</v>
<v Speaker 1>brain.</v>

1213
00:57:13.240 --> 00:57:16.030
<v Speaker 1>We tested the Boston Center for memory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They did a double blind.</v>

1214
00:57:16.031 --> 00:57:19.270
<v Speaker 1>Placebo controlled study showed increase</v>
<v Speaker 1>in verbal memory,</v>

1215
00:57:19.600 --> 00:57:21.190
<v Speaker 1>increased reaction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>speed,</v>

1216
00:57:21.250 --> 00:57:22.870
<v Speaker 1>reaction time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1217
00:57:23.050 --> 00:57:25.150
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other ones,</v>

1218
00:57:25.151 --> 00:57:27.250
<v Speaker 1>Prasad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to them of your mess with any of those,</v>

1219
00:57:27.390 --> 00:57:30.550
<v Speaker 1>know Coleen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your supplement with that.</v>

1220
00:57:30.700 --> 00:57:32.020
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

1221
00:57:32.770 --> 00:57:34.690
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could be smarter I guess.</v>

1222
00:57:34.720 --> 00:57:35.410
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

1223
00:57:35.410 --> 00:57:36.790
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

1224
00:57:36.820 --> 00:57:38.450
<v Speaker 1>it's not smarter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1225
00:57:38.570 --> 00:57:40.570
<v Speaker 1>I don't think anything makes you</v>
<v Speaker 1>smarter.</v>

1226
00:57:40.900 --> 00:57:44.050
<v Speaker 1>I think knowledge makes you smarter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What it does is gives you access,</v>

1227
00:57:44.380 --> 00:57:46.990
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to something that's already in your</v>

1228
00:57:46.991 --> 00:57:47.830
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good,</v>

1229
00:57:47.930 --> 00:57:49.390
<v Speaker 1>little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>little smoother.</v>

1230
00:57:49.480 --> 00:57:53.110
<v Speaker 1>Good recall is important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other thing as a scientist,</v>

1231
00:57:53.111 --> 00:57:58.030
<v Speaker 1>what you need is you need to see a</v>
<v Speaker 1>thousand different sets of data and put</v>

1232
00:57:58.031 --> 00:58:00.220
<v Speaker 1>them into one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can see the connections.</v>

1233
00:58:00.820 --> 00:58:04.570
<v Speaker 1>So I'm exposed to so much information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's drinking from a fire hose every</v>

1234
00:58:04.570 --> 00:58:05.231
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm reading papers,</v>

1235
00:58:05.231 --> 00:58:08.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking to dozens of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have got dozens of companies,</v>

1236
00:58:09.290 --> 00:58:10.660
<v Speaker 1>got two labs in the world.</v>

1237
00:58:10.990 --> 00:58:13.390
<v Speaker 1>It's just coming in and for my brain to</v>
<v Speaker 1>take it in,</v>

1238
00:58:13.840 --> 00:58:16.420
<v Speaker 1>sorted out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>finds links between them,</v>

1239
00:58:16.660 --> 00:58:18.490
<v Speaker 1>connect that person with that</v>
<v Speaker 1>politician,</v>

1240
00:58:18.491 --> 00:58:21.520
<v Speaker 1>with that person in the military.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all going on.</v>

1241
00:58:21.521 --> 00:58:25.180
<v Speaker 1>And a regular brain that isn't trained</v>
<v Speaker 1>would have a hard time.</v>

1242
00:58:25.360 --> 00:58:26.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine.</v>

1243
00:58:26.610 --> 00:58:30.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm so shocked the only drink one cup of</v>
<v Speaker 1>coffee a day with that kind of schedule.</v>

1244
00:58:31.210 --> 00:58:32.230
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

1245
00:58:32.280 --> 00:58:33.640
<v Speaker 1>So the sentiment is good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1246
00:58:33.940 --> 00:58:36.600
<v Speaker 1>do you take nad in an Ivy for?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1247
00:58:36.970 --> 00:58:37.930
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

1248
00:58:38.230 --> 00:58:40.900
<v Speaker 1>I haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've talked to many people that have</v>

1249
00:58:41.350 --> 00:58:44.620
<v Speaker 1>been scheduling it or wanting to</v>
<v Speaker 1>schedule it and putting it off for</v>

1250
00:58:44.621 --> 00:58:46.180
<v Speaker 1>weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

1251
00:58:46.240 --> 00:58:49.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do that soon because I just</v>
<v Speaker 1>know too many people that have extreme</v>

1252
00:58:49.691 --> 00:58:51.790
<v Speaker 1>benefits from it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1253
00:58:51.800 --> 00:58:52.870
<v Speaker 1>sounds good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1254
00:58:52.990 --> 00:58:54.880
<v Speaker 1>do you know anyone who has done it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1255
00:58:56.770 --> 00:58:58.420
<v Speaker 1>that seems like something will be right</v>
<v Speaker 1>up your alley.</v>

1256
00:59:00.200 --> 00:59:00.641
<v Speaker 1>A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1257
00:59:00.641 --> 00:59:03.220
<v Speaker 1>you'd think just being more focused on</v>
<v Speaker 1>curing aging,</v>

1258
00:59:04.270 --> 00:59:08.200
<v Speaker 1>but nad does have supposedly some sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of an effect on aging.</v>

1259
00:59:08.201 --> 00:59:12.400
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ivy Nad I don't know about an ivy nad</v>

1260
00:59:12.720 --> 00:59:15.240
<v Speaker 1>it's been poorly studied,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually has a lot of anecdotes and I</v>

1261
00:59:15.250 --> 00:59:20.250
<v Speaker 1>hear about these all the time but I</v>
<v Speaker 1>haven't seen really a hardcore double</v>

1262
00:59:21.110 --> 00:59:21.943
<v Speaker 1>blind placebo</v>

1263
00:59:22.040 --> 00:59:26.660
<v Speaker 2>controlled trials now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And add in supplemental form though in</v>

1264
00:59:26.661 --> 00:59:30.380
<v Speaker 2>terms of oral orally ingested any day a</v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

1265
00:59:30.560 --> 00:59:33.650
<v Speaker 2>So if you give an a to an animal or a</v>
<v Speaker 2>cell,</v>

1266
00:59:33.920 --> 00:59:37.190
<v Speaker 2>it taken up really poorly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nad is a big molecule.</v>

1267
00:59:37.690 --> 00:59:41.420
<v Speaker 2>NMN is a smaller version of ned that</v>
<v Speaker 2>gets into cells quickly.</v>

1268
00:59:41.900 --> 00:59:44.570
<v Speaker 2>So that's probably a difference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ah.</v>

1269
00:59:44.600 --> 00:59:49.600
<v Speaker 2>So it's the same benefit but it's easier</v>
<v Speaker 2>consumed orally?</v>

1270
00:59:51.020 --> 00:59:53.180
<v Speaker 2>Well I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was still at the cutting edge</v>

1271
00:59:53.181 --> 00:59:54.590
<v Speaker 2>of figuring out what's true and what</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't.</v>

1272
00:59:54.591 --> 00:59:59.591
<v Speaker 2>But Nad is thought to not be well</v>
<v Speaker 2>absorbed in the body as compared to</v>

1273
01:00:00.201 --> 01:00:03.680
<v Speaker 2>these other smaller molecules that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>body then turns into nad once it gets</v>

1274
01:00:03.681 --> 01:00:06.080
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much water do you drink?</v>

1275
01:00:06.770 --> 01:00:07.910
<v Speaker 2>Not Enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Enough.</v>

1276
01:00:07.911 --> 01:00:12.110
<v Speaker 2>I was just speaking with um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some members of Tom Come Brady's team</v>

1277
01:00:12.111 --> 01:00:12.921
<v Speaker 2>and they said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>David,</v>

1278
01:00:12.921 --> 01:00:14.960
<v Speaker 2>you got to drink more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tom Brady's team.</v>

1279
01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:17.393
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1280
01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:20.540
<v Speaker 2>You mean is like physical team,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the Patriots now,</v>

1281
01:00:20.541 --> 01:00:20.971
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his,</v>

1282
01:00:20.971 --> 01:00:23.480
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his CEO of his company.</v>

1283
01:00:23.930 --> 01:00:24.561
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1284
01:00:24.561 --> 01:00:26.720
<v Speaker 2>And they're saying you need to drink</v>
<v Speaker 2>more and you went and got to see.</v>

1285
01:00:26.730 --> 01:00:29.390
<v Speaker 2>It's like a suggestion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm drinking,</v>

1286
01:00:29.990 --> 01:00:32.530
<v Speaker 2>I'm drinking a lot more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

1287
01:00:33.290 --> 01:00:35.150
<v Speaker 2>Then you end up just going to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>bathroom off the time,</v>

1288
01:00:35.151 --> 01:00:35.750
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1289
01:00:35.750 --> 01:00:37.970
<v Speaker 2>got to do what you gotta do you do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do.</v>

1290
01:00:38.170 --> 01:00:41.960
<v Speaker 2>It makes sense to me having a buildup of</v>
<v Speaker 2>toxins in your body and urea isn't a</v>

1291
01:00:41.961 --> 01:00:42.794
<v Speaker 2>good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1292
01:00:43.110 --> 01:00:47.320
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you take anything else that,</v>

1293
01:00:47.330 --> 01:00:48.380
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is notable?</v>

1294
01:00:49.380 --> 01:00:50.660
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can run you through it.</v>

1295
01:00:51.530 --> 01:00:56.510
<v Speaker 2>I'm on Lippert note a Staton for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been on staten since I was in my</v>

1296
01:00:56.511 --> 01:00:58.370
<v Speaker 2>twenties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1297
01:00:59.370 --> 01:01:01.850
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that stuff's fucking terrible for you.</v>

1298
01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:02.930
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1299
01:01:02.990 --> 01:01:07.970
<v Speaker 2>So my good friend and colleague George</v>
<v Speaker 2>Church at Harvard told me I'm killing</v>

1300
01:01:07.971 --> 01:01:10.190
<v Speaker 2>myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I have really high cholesterol.</v>

1301
01:01:10.220 --> 01:01:12.070
<v Speaker 2>My family genetically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Genetically.</v>

1302
01:01:12.071 --> 01:01:13.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

1303
01:01:13.160 --> 01:01:15.740
<v Speaker 2>does your family have a history of heart</v>
<v Speaker 2>disease because of this?</v>

1304
01:01:15.830 --> 01:01:16.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So my grandmother,</v>

1305
01:01:17.090 --> 01:01:18.770
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least according to her had a stroke</v>

1306
01:01:18.771 --> 01:01:21.620
<v Speaker 2>in her thirties and then yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's bad.</v>

1307
01:01:21.621 --> 01:01:24.680
<v Speaker 2>So I'm fighting bad Ashkenazi Jew jeans</v>
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

1308
01:01:27.470 --> 01:01:29.510
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He'd been on them since you're in your</v>

1309
01:01:29.511 --> 01:01:31.400
<v Speaker 2>twenties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's in your thin man.</v>

1310
01:01:31.550 --> 01:01:33.530
<v Speaker 2>If anybody looked at you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would never think that you would</v>

1311
01:01:33.531 --> 01:01:35.360
<v Speaker 2>have an issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1312
01:01:35.390 --> 01:01:36.640
<v Speaker 2>it's unfortunate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm,</v>

1313
01:01:36.700 --> 01:01:39.650
<v Speaker 2>I'm a doctor's worst nightmare first of</v>
<v Speaker 2>all,</v>

1314
01:01:39.710 --> 01:01:42.050
<v Speaker 2>I teach them so I know what they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>like.</v>

1315
01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:43.940
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also when I go into the doctor's</v>

1316
01:01:43.941 --> 01:01:46.370
<v Speaker 2>office I say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's what we should be doing.</v>

1317
01:01:46.540 --> 01:01:48.920
<v Speaker 2>Well you should be doing to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I saw,</v>

1318
01:01:48.921 --> 01:01:51.500
<v Speaker 2>I went in my twenties and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to go into status and this is in</v>

1319
01:01:51.501 --> 01:01:55.220
<v Speaker 2>the days when statens weren't well</v>
<v Speaker 2>studied and my doctor said,</v>

1320
01:01:55.400 --> 01:01:56.900
<v Speaker 2>but you're not old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>

1321
01:01:57.140 --> 01:02:00.890
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to wait until I'm old and</v>
<v Speaker 2>sick to get this medicine.</v>

1322
01:02:00.891 --> 01:02:02.660
<v Speaker 2>I need it now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I fought the doctor foot,</v>

1323
01:02:02.680 --> 01:02:05.690
<v Speaker 2>the doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and eventually he prescribed it and my</v>

1324
01:02:05.691 --> 01:02:07.110
<v Speaker 2>cholesterol came down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1325
01:02:07.250 --> 01:02:10.310
<v Speaker 2>I'm the same with dentists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to the dentist a few months ago</v>

1326
01:02:10.311 --> 01:02:12.200
<v Speaker 2>and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want my teeth fixed,</v>

1327
01:02:12.980 --> 01:02:16.010
<v Speaker 2>my two front teeth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she said they find normal wear and</v>

1328
01:02:16.011 --> 01:02:16.510
<v Speaker 2>tear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>

1329
01:02:16.510 --> 01:02:17.343
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's normal?</v>

1330
01:02:17.720 --> 01:02:20.010
<v Speaker 2>Fixed my teeth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get them back to how I was when I was</v>

1331
01:02:20.010 --> 01:02:20.401
<v Speaker 1>20.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1332
01:02:20.401 --> 01:02:21.390
<v Speaker 1>we don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't do that.</v>

1333
01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:24.060
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you did my daughter right last week.</v>

1334
01:02:24.300 --> 01:02:25.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But she's young.</v>

1335
01:02:25.591 --> 01:02:27.150
<v Speaker 1>She's got a future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1336
01:02:27.570 --> 01:02:31.350
<v Speaker 1>oh see done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't be wrong with your teeth are</v>

1337
01:02:31.430 --> 01:02:33.540
<v Speaker 1>wearing out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I hated feeling that one out.</v>

1338
01:02:33.750 --> 01:02:36.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm wearing cow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't get that way.</v>

1339
01:02:36.940 --> 01:02:39.300
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just getting shorter and flatter and</v>

1340
01:02:39.301 --> 01:02:44.301
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck you eat and rocks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I must be the Australian Diet.</v>

1341
01:02:45.750 --> 01:02:48.570
<v Speaker 1>A lot of sand in your food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I said to her,</v>

1342
01:02:48.870 --> 01:02:50.810
<v Speaker 1>I thought you were one of the world's</v>
<v Speaker 1>best dentist.</v>

1343
01:02:50.811 --> 01:02:52.560
<v Speaker 1>And she said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1344
01:02:52.561 --> 01:02:53.610
<v Speaker 1>fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll do it.</v>

1345
01:02:53.970 --> 01:02:56.710
<v Speaker 1>But don't blame me if it doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1346
01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:58.460
<v Speaker 1>and so she works like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1347
01:02:58.710 --> 01:03:02.910
<v Speaker 1>she was worried that it might snap off</v>
<v Speaker 1>or putting a cap on you.</v>

1348
01:03:03.330 --> 01:03:04.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's extending my two front teeth were</v>

1349
01:03:04.931 --> 01:03:08.160
<v Speaker 1>just normal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like people get caps all the time.</v>

1350
01:03:08.350 --> 01:03:08.490
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>

1351
01:03:08.490 --> 01:03:11.930
<v Speaker 1>Well it's not a cap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's actually just material stuck to the</v>

1352
01:03:12.060 --> 01:03:16.370
<v Speaker 1>tape just on the tip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also like if you had a chip too,</v>

1353
01:03:16.420 --> 01:03:18.150
<v Speaker 1>they would do that instead of replace</v>
<v Speaker 1>the actual.</v>

1354
01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:20.400
<v Speaker 1>That's what I did to my daughter and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

1355
01:03:20.401 --> 01:03:21.570
<v Speaker 1>do that to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That looks great.</v>

1356
01:03:21.690 --> 01:03:22.620
<v Speaker 1>And she said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1357
01:03:22.621 --> 01:03:22.980
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1358
01:03:22.980 --> 01:03:24.000
<v Speaker 1>Finally she said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1359
01:03:24.001 --> 01:03:25.980
<v Speaker 1>but it's your problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to pay for it.</v>

1360
01:03:26.310 --> 01:03:27.580
<v Speaker 1>Fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1361
01:03:27.870 --> 01:03:29.970
<v Speaker 1>and she did it and she actually said at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the end of it,</v>

1362
01:03:30.570 --> 01:03:32.940
<v Speaker 1>this is great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might offer this as a procedure to</v>

1363
01:03:32.941 --> 01:03:36.160
<v Speaker 1>other patients,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>

1364
01:03:36.210 --> 01:03:40.860
<v Speaker 1>But my point is not about teeth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the medical profession is ageist.</v>

1365
01:03:40.890 --> 01:03:43.170
<v Speaker 1>They give young people certain</v>
<v Speaker 1>treatments because they're young and</v>

1366
01:03:43.171 --> 01:03:45.660
<v Speaker 1>they don't give them to the old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then they don't give the young</v>

1367
01:03:45.661 --> 01:03:47.940
<v Speaker 1>people the treatments that they need</v>
<v Speaker 1>before they get old.</v>

1368
01:03:48.510 --> 01:03:51.510
<v Speaker 1>Wacky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a similar thing happened with a</v>

1369
01:03:51.540 --> 01:03:54.930
<v Speaker 1>torn meniscus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a minor meniscus tear,</v>

1370
01:03:55.290 --> 01:03:58.710
<v Speaker 1>and the guy told me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well if you were young,</v>

1371
01:03:58.711 --> 01:04:01.740
<v Speaker 1>they would stitch it up and hope that it</v>
<v Speaker 1>would heal.</v>

1372
01:04:02.370 --> 01:04:03.720
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck does that mean?</v>

1373
01:04:03.930 --> 01:04:05.910
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything works good.</v>

1374
01:04:05.970 --> 01:04:09.420
<v Speaker 1>Like what is different?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the difference between me and a</v>

1375
01:04:09.421 --> 01:04:12.210
<v Speaker 1>younger body of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said something about blood flow,</v>

1376
01:04:12.630 --> 01:04:14.310
<v Speaker 1>you have more blood flow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

1377
01:04:14.311 --> 01:04:15.690
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a doctor but that doesn't make</v>

1378
01:04:15.691 --> 01:04:17.190
<v Speaker 1>any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

1379
01:04:17.250 --> 01:04:19.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm working out all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of blood going through</v>

1380
01:04:19.711 --> 01:04:21.390
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what the fuck is happening?</v>

1381
01:04:21.870 --> 01:04:24.720
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like let's just shoot some stem</v>
<v Speaker 1>cells in there and see what's up because</v>

1382
01:04:24.721 --> 01:04:29.670
<v Speaker 1>they wanted to do a meniscus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The</v>

1383
01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:33.630
<v Speaker 1>meniscus copy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever they call it when they cut some</v>

1384
01:04:33.631 --> 01:04:36.030
<v Speaker 1>of the meniscus out and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eh,</v>

1385
01:04:36.031 --> 01:04:37.840
<v Speaker 1>let's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's just try it.</v>

1386
01:04:38.100 --> 01:04:41.130
<v Speaker 1>It's totally working like A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have any pain in it now.</v>

1387
01:04:42.420 --> 01:04:46.320
<v Speaker 1>So I think there's a weird thing that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do do when you get to a certain</v>

1388
01:04:46.321 --> 01:04:47.154
<v Speaker 1>age,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Eh,</v>

1389
01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:50.040
<v Speaker 1>like I have a friend who was a torn acl</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they essentially,</v>

1390
01:04:50.041 --> 01:04:52.380
<v Speaker 1>he's in his fifties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>late fifties,</v>

1391
01:04:52.770 --> 01:04:54.540
<v Speaker 1>and they essentially told not to fix it.</v>

1392
01:04:54.540 --> 01:04:55.650
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey fucker,</v>

1393
01:04:55.710 --> 01:04:57.300
<v Speaker 1>get it fixed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you crazy?</v>

1394
01:04:57.301 --> 01:04:59.490
<v Speaker 1>And I have a wobbly knee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're like,</v>

1395
01:04:59.491 --> 01:05:00.990
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they told me if I was younger,</v>

1396
01:05:00.991 --> 01:05:04.140
<v Speaker 1>did I fuck that doctor?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go get that thing fixed.</v>

1397
01:05:04.740 --> 01:05:06.060
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well how the recovery time?</v>

1398
01:05:06.061 --> 01:05:08.730
<v Speaker 1>Like shut up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just recover.</v>

1399
01:05:09.040 --> 01:05:11.160
<v Speaker 1>You're alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A year goes by,</v>

1400
01:05:11.161 --> 01:05:12.570
<v Speaker 1>it's fixed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just stop.</v>

1401
01:05:12.810 --> 01:05:14.100
<v Speaker 1>Just go get it fixed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1402
01:05:14.280 --> 01:05:17.700
<v Speaker 1>See that's the problem with today's</v>
<v Speaker 1>society because we think a 50 old is</v>

1403
01:05:18.460 --> 01:05:22.210
<v Speaker 1>dale that's dead at 50 is still very</v>
<v Speaker 1>young.</v>

1404
01:05:22.211 --> 01:05:24.550
<v Speaker 1>Actually there are 78,</v>
<v Speaker 1>70 year old 80 year olds,</v>

1405
01:05:24.700 --> 01:05:27.400
<v Speaker 1>nine year olds still playing tennis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>loving life.</v>

1406
01:05:27.401 --> 01:05:29.170
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just the beginning of what's</v>

1407
01:05:29.171 --> 01:05:31.930
<v Speaker 1>coming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you maintain activity that that seems</v>

1408
01:05:31.931 --> 01:05:34.750
<v Speaker 1>to be the key.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The the really hard thing is when</v>

1409
01:05:34.751 --> 01:05:38.350
<v Speaker 1>someone's in their fifties and they want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get in shape now and they haven't</v>

1410
01:05:38.351 --> 01:05:41.090
<v Speaker 1>been active their whole life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that seems to be a problem.</v>

1411
01:05:41.300 --> 01:05:43.450
<v Speaker 1>Their DVD is scratched up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1412
01:05:43.451 --> 01:05:46.150
<v Speaker 1>Hard to go back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can be done though.</v>

1413
01:05:46.630 --> 01:05:51.630
<v Speaker 1>I did see a guy who was 58 years old who</v>
<v Speaker 1>started running marathons at 58 in his</v>

1414
01:05:52.691 --> 01:05:55.750
<v Speaker 1>seventies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's running a sub three hour marathons</v>

1415
01:05:56.590 --> 01:05:58.460
<v Speaker 1>and he looks great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it just.</v>

1416
01:05:58.690 --> 01:06:03.510
<v Speaker 1>He just had to take his time and really</v>
<v Speaker 1>be dedicated and watch his diet,</v>

1417
01:06:03.540 --> 01:06:06.280
<v Speaker 1>nutrition and next thing you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy's an elite marathon runner.</v>

1418
01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:09.640
<v Speaker 1>It is doable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What we find in the lab is if we treat</v>

1419
01:06:09.670 --> 01:06:12.250
<v Speaker 1>mice early in life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gives them the battle much better</v>

1420
01:06:12.251 --> 01:06:12.790
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spanish,</v>

1421
01:06:12.790 --> 01:06:15.220
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So don't ever leave it too late.</v>

1422
01:06:15.310 --> 01:06:19.630
<v Speaker 1>Will you see that with athletes like</v>
<v Speaker 1>athletes that were fit when they were</v>

1423
01:06:19.631 --> 01:06:23.950
<v Speaker 1>young and never lost it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really maintained and stayed in the gym</v>

1424
01:06:23.951 --> 01:06:26.500
<v Speaker 1>and stayed active.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see them in their fifties and</v>

1425
01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:29.710
<v Speaker 1>sixties looking great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas you know,</v>

1426
01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:34.920
<v Speaker 1>it's just once your body deteriorates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult to bring it back.</v>

1427
01:06:35.260 --> 01:06:39.160
<v Speaker 1>But if you maintain it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems like there's people today that</v>

1428
01:06:39.161 --> 01:06:41.800
<v Speaker 1>are doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's much more common if you go to a</v>

1429
01:06:41.801 --> 01:06:42.820
<v Speaker 1>gym,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for instance,</v>

1430
01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:45.640
<v Speaker 1>go to a nice gym,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll see a lot of folks that are in</v>

1431
01:06:45.641 --> 01:06:49.060
<v Speaker 1>their sixties and seventies that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>really active and they're there all the</v>

1432
01:06:49.061 --> 01:06:51.580
<v Speaker 1>time and they're regulars had the gym</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they look great.</v>

1433
01:06:52.450 --> 01:06:54.130
<v Speaker 1>They do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So my father is a,</v>

1434
01:06:54.270 --> 01:06:57.190
<v Speaker 1>as a prime example of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's in Australia and he's been</v>

1435
01:06:57.191 --> 01:07:00.820
<v Speaker 1>taking care of his body since he was in</v>
<v Speaker 1>his early forties.</v>

1436
01:07:01.630 --> 01:07:06.310
<v Speaker 1>Probably a little too late,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but still he's been taking metformin for</v>

1437
01:07:06.311 --> 01:07:07.510
<v Speaker 1>awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Resveratrol.</v>

1438
01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:10.090
<v Speaker 1>But he's been active.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the key,</v>

1439
01:07:10.210 --> 01:07:11.080
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

1440
01:07:11.081 --> 01:07:12.220
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that combination.</v>

1441
01:07:12.430 --> 01:07:17.170
<v Speaker 1>So he's now just turning 80 this year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would think that he's 30 if you,</v>

1442
01:07:17.230 --> 01:07:20.980
<v Speaker 1>if you didn't know his age and he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>running around.</v>

1443
01:07:22.200 --> 01:07:23.650
<v Speaker 1>My mother passed away from cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's,</v>

1444
01:07:23.740 --> 01:07:25.900
<v Speaker 1>he's dating women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's out every night.</v>

1445
01:07:25.901 --> 01:07:28.750
<v Speaker 1>He's traveling the world now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the future for,</v>

1446
01:07:29.170 --> 01:07:31.430
<v Speaker 1>for people in their eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1447
01:07:31.570 --> 01:07:36.570
<v Speaker 1>he started a new career at 80.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was at a 76.</v>

1448
01:07:36.820 --> 01:07:38.140
<v Speaker 1>What's he doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got bored,</v>

1449
01:07:38.580 --> 01:07:42.340
<v Speaker 1>so he retired at 67,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought he hadn't now the 10 years of</v>

1450
01:07:42.390 --> 01:07:44.200
<v Speaker 1>goodlife and he kept going and going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>going.</v>

1451
01:07:44.201 --> 01:07:46.150
<v Speaker 1>His friends are getting frail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's still active,</v>

1452
01:07:46.570 --> 01:07:51.370
<v Speaker 1>so he went back and he's working at</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sydney University on the ethics panel</v>

1453
01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:55.480
<v Speaker 1>for clinical trials and other studies</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's what you want older people</v>

1454
01:07:55.570 --> 01:07:57.850
<v Speaker 1>with wisdom and knowledge to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to give back.</v>

1455
01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.790
<v Speaker 1>That sounds good too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like for you,</v>

1456
01:08:01.200 --> 01:08:04.780
<v Speaker 1>you get your dad hopped up on all these</v>
<v Speaker 1>awesome new drugs.</v>

1457
01:08:04.781 --> 01:08:09.430
<v Speaker 1>Then you get them working on the ethics</v>
<v Speaker 1>panel for clinical studies and then you</v>

1458
01:08:09.431 --> 01:08:13.990
<v Speaker 1>get them to give you some death row</v>
<v Speaker 1>patients so you can try it on.</v>

1459
01:08:14.040 --> 01:08:14.920
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ethics,</v>

1460
01:08:15.230 --> 01:08:16.010
<v Speaker 1>you're onto me.</v>

1461
01:08:16.010 --> 01:08:17.900
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know what you're doing now man.</v>

1462
01:08:18.140 --> 01:08:19.970
<v Speaker 3>You're wiggling the system a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 3>with your.</v>

1463
01:08:20.090 --> 01:08:21.740
<v Speaker 3>Keep it in the family.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hyper active,</v>

1464
01:08:21.741 --> 01:08:23.690
<v Speaker 3>super healthy dad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1465
01:08:23.750 --> 01:08:25.340
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't recommend anything even to my</v>

1466
01:08:25.341 --> 01:08:27.440
<v Speaker 3>family,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they end up to mending it.</v>

1467
01:08:27.470 --> 01:08:30.260
<v Speaker 3>My brother was pretty upset that we</v>
<v Speaker 3>weren't giving him any.</v>

1468
01:08:31.460 --> 01:08:33.290
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it seems like it's working out really</v>

1469
01:08:33.291 --> 01:08:34.820
<v Speaker 3>well for your father.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1470
01:08:34.821 --> 01:08:39.821
<v Speaker 3>so metformin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Nmm and what else is he taking a,</v>

1471
01:08:41.030 --> 01:08:44.020
<v Speaker 3>he's also on a Staton and he exercises.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's amazing.</v>

1472
01:08:44.030 --> 01:08:47.270
<v Speaker 3>So he's understanding as well because he</v>
<v Speaker 3>has the same predisposed condition,</v>

1473
01:08:47.870 --> 01:08:49.910
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's an awful condition,</v>

1474
01:08:49.911 --> 01:08:50.281
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That,</v>

1475
01:08:50.281 --> 01:08:52.040
<v Speaker 3>that may mean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the things that I was talking to</v>

1476
01:08:52.041 --> 01:08:56.330
<v Speaker 3>my doctor about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was saying that that there are people</v>

1477
01:08:56.331 --> 01:08:59.000
<v Speaker 3>that just have high blood pressure or</v>
<v Speaker 3>higher,</v>

1478
01:08:59.060 --> 01:09:00.700
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>higher blood pressure,</v>

1479
01:09:00.750 --> 01:09:04.370
<v Speaker 3>higher instances of heart disease and</v>
<v Speaker 3>their family and it's just a really</v>

1480
01:09:04.371 --> 01:09:06.440
<v Speaker 3>unfortunate genetic issue.</v>

1481
01:09:07.410 --> 01:09:08.330
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is,</v>

1482
01:09:08.450 --> 01:09:10.850
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But fortunately we were able to tackle</v>

1483
01:09:10.851 --> 01:09:13.940
<v Speaker 2>heart disease pretty well these days</v>
<v Speaker 2>with blood pressure,</v>

1484
01:09:13.941 --> 01:09:14.810
<v Speaker 2>drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cholesterol,</v>

1485
01:09:14.811 --> 01:09:16.430
<v Speaker 2>drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were some side effects,</v>

1486
01:09:16.431 --> 01:09:18.980
<v Speaker 2>no question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what we're talking about with these</v>

1487
01:09:19.100 --> 01:09:22.880
<v Speaker 2>longevity drugs that are in development</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that sure you can be prescribed this</v>

1488
01:09:22.881 --> 01:09:25.430
<v Speaker 2>medicine for your Alzheimer's or fewer</v>
<v Speaker 2>liver disease,</v>

1489
01:09:25.670 --> 01:09:28.460
<v Speaker 2>but as a side effect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'll keep the rest of your body healthy</v>

1490
01:09:28.461 --> 01:09:30.560
<v Speaker 2>as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Protect you against cancer and all these</v>

1491
01:09:30.561 --> 01:09:32.420
<v Speaker 2>other things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what's so radical,</v>

1492
01:09:32.590 --> 01:09:35.830
<v Speaker 3>what we're doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

1493
01:09:35.870 --> 01:09:40.330
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what about crispr and what do you think</v>

1494
01:09:40.430 --> 01:09:45.190
<v Speaker 3>a is going to come out of that in terms</v>
<v Speaker 3>of like real world application for an</v>

1495
01:09:45.191 --> 01:09:46.420
<v Speaker 3>adult?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1496
01:09:46.421 --> 01:09:48.220
<v Speaker 3>what if people don't know what Crispr</v>
<v Speaker 3>is?</v>

1497
01:09:48.221 --> 01:09:51.010
<v Speaker 3>Please explain it in layman's terms.</v>

1498
01:09:51.360 --> 01:09:51.761
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1499
01:09:51.761 --> 01:09:56.080
<v Speaker 2>so crispr is a term that was invented in</v>
<v Speaker 2>my department probably,</v>

1500
01:09:56.530 --> 01:09:59.380
<v Speaker 2>so I know it pretty well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a back bacteria,</v>

1501
01:09:59.381 --> 01:10:01.780
<v Speaker 2>have an immune system that cuts</v>
<v Speaker 2>invaders,</v>

1502
01:10:01.950 --> 01:10:05.530
<v Speaker 2>cut the DNA and what we've done now as</v>
<v Speaker 2>scientists,</v>

1503
01:10:05.531 --> 01:10:09.520
<v Speaker 2>we've now utilize that system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take it out of the bacteria and we use</v>

1504
01:10:09.521 --> 01:10:13.960
<v Speaker 2>it to create designer mutations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>design a gene,</v>

1505
01:10:13.961 --> 01:10:18.961
<v Speaker 2>changes in animals and also in humans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's a bacterial immune system that</v>

1506
01:10:20.081 --> 01:10:22.900
<v Speaker 2>corrects genes and we use it all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>time now.</v>

1507
01:10:22.901 --> 01:10:23.734
<v Speaker 2>It's um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1508
01:10:24.010 --> 01:10:27.130
<v Speaker 2>it's actually what's interesting about</v>
<v Speaker 2>is being able to mutate genes for many</v>

1509
01:10:27.130 --> 01:10:29.770
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this is dial up a gene mutation.</v>

1510
01:10:29.800 --> 01:10:31.810
<v Speaker 2>You can choose exactly where you want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>make it.</v>

1511
01:10:32.350 --> 01:10:34.600
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I think many of your listeners will</v>

1512
01:10:34.601 --> 01:10:37.630
<v Speaker 2>know that recently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a late last year,</v>

1513
01:10:37.960 --> 01:10:42.160
<v Speaker 2>Chinese researcher and our field came</v>
<v Speaker 2>out and said he's engineered a couple of</v>

1514
01:10:42.190 --> 01:10:46.960
<v Speaker 2>twin girls with crispr to be resistant</v>
<v Speaker 2>to HIV AIDS virus.</v>

1515
01:10:47.720 --> 01:10:49.050
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1516
01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:52.650
<v Speaker 3>if they're telling you that when you got</v>
<v Speaker 3>to think they're doing some stuff</v>

1517
01:10:52.651 --> 01:10:54.080
<v Speaker 3>they're not telling you about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1518
01:10:54.650 --> 01:10:55.130
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1519
01:10:55.130 --> 01:10:58.970
<v Speaker 3>Have some kids with giant heads and.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well it's coming through walls.</v>

1520
01:10:59.270 --> 01:11:00.110
<v Speaker 3>Rewind.</v>

1521
01:11:00.470 --> 01:11:04.730
<v Speaker 2>Well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you start to see people that are 90</v>

1522
01:11:04.870 --> 01:11:07.060
<v Speaker 2>and they're still as young as 20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1523
01:11:07.070 --> 01:11:08.360
<v Speaker 2>something's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1524
01:11:08.361 --> 01:11:09.194
<v Speaker 2>That's the weird</v>

1525
01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:10.000
<v Speaker 3>one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1526
01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.310
<v Speaker 3>If you can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd go,</v>

1527
01:11:12.311 --> 01:11:13.050
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are you doing?</v>

1528
01:11:13.050 --> 01:11:14.150
<v Speaker 3>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just eating</v>

1529
01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:16.020
<v Speaker 1>healthy looking good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take care of bots.</v>

1530
01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:18.420
<v Speaker 1>Not going to tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1531
01:11:18.421 --> 01:11:18.781
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1532
01:11:18.781 --> 01:11:19.960
<v Speaker 1>so consider this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1533
01:11:20.030 --> 01:11:22.570
<v Speaker 1>So the chance of getting HIV in China is</v>
<v Speaker 1>one in a thousand.</v>

1534
01:11:23.130 --> 01:11:27.180
<v Speaker 1>So that doctor was seemingly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he thought he was ethical,</v>

1535
01:11:27.181 --> 01:11:28.830
<v Speaker 1>protecting the babies from something</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

1536
01:11:29.430 --> 01:11:33.180
<v Speaker 1>I would say really rare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas if you really wanted to do</v>

1537
01:11:33.181 --> 01:11:37.170
<v Speaker 1>something helpful to those kids and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>agreed it was something you should do,</v>

1538
01:11:37.620 --> 01:11:40.380
<v Speaker 1>why not make them resistant to heart</v>
<v Speaker 1>disease or cancer?</v>

1539
01:11:40.890 --> 01:11:43.680
<v Speaker 1>We can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was weird that he chose HIV as the</v>

1540
01:11:43.681 --> 01:11:45.780
<v Speaker 1>first test.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do you think they did that?</v>

1541
01:11:46.120 --> 01:11:49.650
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think because it was a very well</v>

1542
01:11:49.651 --> 01:11:53.340
<v Speaker 1>understood mutation that would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you just destroyed the gene,</v>

1543
01:11:53.341 --> 01:11:55.710
<v Speaker 1>it would work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas with these other diseases,</v>

1544
01:11:55.711 --> 01:11:58.920
<v Speaker 1>you have to be much more precise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the reason that we scientists got</v>

1545
01:11:58.921 --> 01:12:03.720
<v Speaker 1>really upset was that he did it in</v>
<v Speaker 1>secrecy and then just launched it on the</v>

1546
01:12:03.721 --> 01:12:07.650
<v Speaker 1>world and that kind of thing because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a fine line in ethics.</v>

1547
01:12:07.650 --> 01:12:11.400
<v Speaker 1>You want to be doing that with total</v>
<v Speaker 1>transparency running.</v>

1548
01:12:11.850 --> 01:12:16.850
<v Speaker 1>I think he was hoping to become a win a</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobel prize or be a star and it,</v>

1549
01:12:17.251 --> 01:12:20.610
<v Speaker 1>it backfired on him because he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just did it in secrecy.</v>

1550
01:12:21.190 --> 01:12:23.150
<v Speaker 1>It backfired in the scientific</v>
<v Speaker 1>community.</v>

1551
01:12:23.610 --> 01:12:25.320
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the real world,</v>

1552
01:12:25.350 --> 01:12:28.380
<v Speaker 1>in the media,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was shocked how little discussion</v>

1553
01:12:28.381 --> 01:12:30.330
<v Speaker 1>there was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If this news came out in the two</v>

1554
01:12:30.331 --> 01:12:32.230
<v Speaker 1>thousands during the Bush era,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would,</v>

1555
01:12:32.260 --> 01:12:34.080
<v Speaker 1>there would have been panels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>investigations,</v>

1556
01:12:34.081 --> 01:12:35.550
<v Speaker 1>it would have been in the news for</v>
<v Speaker 1>months,</v>

1557
01:12:36.120 --> 01:12:37.100
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People went,</v>

1558
01:12:37.190 --> 01:12:38.820
<v Speaker 1>Ahhh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's next on twitter?</v>

1559
01:12:39.060 --> 01:12:40.530
<v Speaker 1>Do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just because of the news cycle.</v>

1560
01:12:40.531 --> 01:12:42.060
<v Speaker 1>So insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

1561
01:12:42.220 --> 01:12:43.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1562
01:12:43.800 --> 01:12:48.780
<v Speaker 1>when you have a scientific experiment of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that nature,</v>

1563
01:12:49.230 --> 01:12:52.230
<v Speaker 1>what's the standard protocol for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>scientist?</v>

1564
01:12:52.231 --> 01:12:56.430
<v Speaker 1>Whether it is or is it the same in China</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in Russia and the United States as a</v>

1565
01:12:56.431 --> 01:13:01.431
<v Speaker 1>scientific community almost operate</v>
<v Speaker 1>under different,</v>

1566
01:13:01.560 --> 01:13:04.830
<v Speaker 1>like a different set of rules than</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything else.</v>

1567
01:13:05.990 --> 01:13:08.170
<v Speaker 1>You mean between countries or.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1568
01:13:08.340 --> 01:13:10.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like obviously technology is not shared</v>

1569
01:13:10.980 --> 01:13:14.610
<v Speaker 1>like China is doing something</v>
<v Speaker 1>technologically.</v>

1570
01:13:14.970 --> 01:13:17.760
<v Speaker 1>United States is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have to speculate,</v>

1571
01:13:17.761 --> 01:13:20.520
<v Speaker 1>we have to figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when it comes to medical science,</v>

1572
01:13:20.570 --> 01:13:23.370
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it sort of an open book because</v>

1573
01:13:23.371 --> 01:13:28.371
<v Speaker 1>everybody sharing information a no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or at least alerting everyone to what</v>

1574
01:13:28.741 --> 01:13:29.940
<v Speaker 1>they're working on or.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1575
01:13:29.960 --> 01:13:33.330
<v Speaker 1>I know where you're going with this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At least I think I do.</v>

1576
01:13:33.960 --> 01:13:34.401
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1577
01:13:34.401 --> 01:13:37.890
<v Speaker 1>So I advised governments around the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world about what's going on.</v>

1578
01:13:38.060 --> 01:13:41.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm under the radar as best I know and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are countries I'm not going to</v>

1579
01:13:41.941 --> 01:13:46.941
<v Speaker 1>name them that are doing research under</v>
<v Speaker 1>the radar and are preventing people like</v>

1580
01:13:47.551 --> 01:13:50.670
<v Speaker 1>myself from entering those buildings to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a look what's going on.</v>

1581
01:13:51.300 --> 01:13:52.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm sure that,</v>

1582
01:13:53.470 --> 01:13:56.850
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on in there is actually a</v>

1583
01:13:56.880 --> 01:13:59.970
<v Speaker 1>little bit broader than what we hear</v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

1584
01:14:00.540 --> 01:14:02.380
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How long has it performed?</v>

1585
01:14:02.420 --> 01:14:03.630
<v Speaker 1>Just say Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1586
01:14:03.631 --> 01:14:05.310
<v Speaker 1>I didn't say Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't say anything.</v>

1587
01:14:05.510 --> 01:14:08.490
<v Speaker 1>No country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to be able to travel to Russia.</v>

1588
01:14:11.250 --> 01:14:11.771
<v Speaker 1>Bye.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1589
01:14:11.771 --> 01:14:12.160
<v Speaker 1>I said</v>

1590
01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:12.690
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But in,</v>

1591
01:14:12.690 --> 01:14:15.020
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in countries where there are a stent,</v>

1592
01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:18.850
<v Speaker 2>different standards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's stopping a mothers who wants to</v>

1593
01:14:18.851 --> 01:14:22.150
<v Speaker 2>prevent their child from having heart</v>
<v Speaker 2>disease which could kill their child,</v>

1594
01:14:22.720 --> 01:14:25.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>40 percent chance versus 100,000 and</v>

1595
01:14:25.781 --> 01:14:30.520
<v Speaker 2>eventually you could make a child that</v>
<v Speaker 2>could live 200 years once we know how to</v>

1596
01:14:30.521 --> 01:14:32.470
<v Speaker 2>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That could be the future.</v>

1597
01:14:33.990 --> 01:14:38.990
<v Speaker 3>There's always a concern that someone is</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing something that is beneficial in</v>

1598
01:14:39.631 --> 01:14:43.740
<v Speaker 3>one way but negative in another way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if everyone doesn't get to examine</v>

1599
01:14:43.741 --> 01:14:45.260
<v Speaker 3>the research,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1600
01:14:46.020 --> 01:14:49.440
<v Speaker 3>it's very difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if we wanted to in the United</v>

1601
01:14:49.440 --> 01:14:52.440
<v Speaker 3>States wanted to do something similar to</v>
<v Speaker 3>what they're doing over there,</v>

1602
01:14:52.740 --> 01:14:55.020
<v Speaker 3>we would want to have access to what</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've learned,</v>

1603
01:14:55.200 --> 01:14:56.033
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1604
01:14:56.540 --> 01:14:57.610
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we would.</v>

1605
01:14:57.611 --> 01:15:00.040
<v Speaker 2>And so generally scientists share</v>
<v Speaker 2>inflammation,</v>

1606
01:15:00.310 --> 01:15:03.730
<v Speaker 2>but there are companies that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>government owned that are very sacred,</v>

1607
01:15:04.010 --> 01:15:07.750
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or even private organizations and that's</v>

1608
01:15:07.751 --> 01:15:10.410
<v Speaker 2>where it's a little tricky and that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>why we,</v>

1609
01:15:10.470 --> 01:15:14.020
<v Speaker 2>we signed his get really upset when</v>
<v Speaker 2>companies or organizations don't share</v>

1610
01:15:14.021 --> 01:15:17.140
<v Speaker 2>information,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially in something this critical</v>

1611
01:15:17.830 --> 01:15:21.160
<v Speaker 2>and what's not really stated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's my belief is that one of the</v>

1612
01:15:21.161 --> 01:15:24.520
<v Speaker 2>reasons it was such a backlash against</v>
<v Speaker 2>this crispr design,</v>

1613
01:15:24.521 --> 01:15:29.380
<v Speaker 2>a baby experiment and it really was an</v>
<v Speaker 2>experiment and it's not just that it was</v>

1614
01:15:29.381 --> 01:15:33.430
<v Speaker 2>potentially dangerous and you could end</v>
<v Speaker 2>up with kids that have deformities,</v>

1615
01:15:34.180 --> 01:15:38.560
<v Speaker 2>but also that unless we do this in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a measured manner,</v>

1616
01:15:39.010 --> 01:15:41.020
<v Speaker 2>under supervision,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

1617
01:15:41.110 --> 01:15:44.980
<v Speaker 2>there could be a backlash like there was</v>
<v Speaker 2>against stem cell research in the two</v>

1618
01:15:44.981 --> 01:15:46.540
<v Speaker 2>thousands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't want that.</v>

1619
01:15:46.541 --> 01:15:48.370
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we want to be able to do this the right</v>

1620
01:15:48.371 --> 01:15:49.500
<v Speaker 2>way this time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1621
01:15:49.540 --> 01:15:52.560
<v Speaker 2>Is it particularly if something goes</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong with those children?</v>

1622
01:15:52.750 --> 01:15:55.270
<v Speaker 2>One person could ruin it for millions of</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

1623
01:15:55.690 --> 01:15:57.980
<v Speaker 2>Jump The gun and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we're,</v>

1624
01:15:58.010 --> 01:15:59.850
<v Speaker 2>we're on the second generation of</v>
<v Speaker 2>Crispr.</v>

1625
01:15:59.851 --> 01:16:00.684
<v Speaker 2>Is that correct?</v>

1626
01:16:02.360 --> 01:16:05.330
<v Speaker 3>Use of the editing tools.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've become more.</v>

1627
01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:06.833
<v Speaker 2>They have that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

1628
01:16:06.930 --> 01:16:11.680
<v Speaker 2>there's surprisingly that there's lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>different bacteria that have the,</v>

1629
01:16:11.850 --> 01:16:13.000
<v Speaker 2>these systems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we're,</v>

1630
01:16:13.030 --> 01:16:17.310
<v Speaker 2>we're getting new ones all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some that are more accurate because you</v>

1631
01:16:17.311 --> 01:16:18.900
<v Speaker 2>don't want what we call off target</v>
<v Speaker 2>effect.</v>

1632
01:16:18.901 --> 01:16:22.440
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to accidentally mutates</v>
<v Speaker 2>some Jane that's required for head</v>

1633
01:16:22.441 --> 01:16:23.820
<v Speaker 2>development.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1634
01:16:23.870 --> 01:16:24.703
<v Speaker 2>and so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

1635
01:16:25.560 --> 01:16:27.960
<v Speaker 2>I think in my department were on fourth</v>
<v Speaker 2>generation,</v>

1636
01:16:27.990 --> 01:16:29.520
<v Speaker 2>fourth generation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1637
01:16:29.820 --> 01:16:32.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See I'm just going by radio lab</v>

1638
01:16:32.311 --> 01:16:34.320
<v Speaker 2>podcasts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1639
01:16:34.350 --> 01:16:35.640
<v Speaker 2>So My,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my department have fun,</v>

1640
01:16:35.760 --> 01:16:38.790
<v Speaker 2>Fun Department to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine they are imitating all sorts of</v>

1641
01:16:38.791 --> 01:16:41.730
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What did you ever see the documentary</v>

1642
01:16:41.731 --> 01:16:44.800
<v Speaker 2>icarus?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

1643
01:16:44.801 --> 01:16:45.560
<v Speaker 2>it rings a bell.</v>

1644
01:16:45.560 --> 01:16:50.560
<v Speaker 3>It's Brian Fogle's documentary on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Russian doping program,</v>

1645
01:16:50.751 --> 01:16:55.751
<v Speaker 3>state sponsored doping program in Sochi,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Sochi Olympics and how they had this</v>

1646
01:16:57.621 --> 01:17:02.150
<v Speaker 3>incredibly complicated system of</v>
<v Speaker 3>stealing the urine and putting it</v>

1647
01:17:02.151 --> 01:17:04.710
<v Speaker 3>through a hole in the wall and putting</v>
<v Speaker 3>fake urine back through.</v>

1648
01:17:04.711 --> 01:17:06.110
<v Speaker 3>It was really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really amazing.</v>

1649
01:17:06.470 --> 01:17:08.030
<v Speaker 3>Amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>amazing documentary,</v>

1650
01:17:08.031 --> 01:17:10.070
<v Speaker 3>but details</v>

1651
01:17:10.520 --> 01:17:15.520
<v Speaker 1>this incredibly complicated state</v>
<v Speaker 1>sponsored doping system.</v>

1652
01:17:16.340 --> 01:17:21.340
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine that with something like</v>
<v Speaker 1>crispr or some various new forms of</v>

1653
01:17:23.781 --> 01:17:27.530
<v Speaker 1>genetic editing that that's one of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that they're going to be looking</v>

1654
01:17:27.531 --> 01:17:30.050
<v Speaker 1>into,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're going to be looking into</v>

1655
01:17:30.051 --> 01:17:33.050
<v Speaker 1>things that are gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>enhance athletic performance.</v>

1656
01:17:33.380 --> 01:17:35.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you might need to have a DNA test</v>

1657
01:17:35.631 --> 01:17:37.810
<v Speaker 1>to see if you've put one of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>viruses in your.</v>

1658
01:17:38.710 --> 01:17:41.080
<v Speaker 1>Why you 50 and now you're running like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 year old,</v>

1659
01:17:42.010 --> 01:17:44.450
<v Speaker 1>so that's all possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know that the.</v>

1660
01:17:45.090 --> 01:17:49.980
<v Speaker 1>I also write reports for governments and</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that I predicted 50</v>

1661
01:17:50.180 --> 01:17:54.500
<v Speaker 1>within the next 15 years was crispr</v>
<v Speaker 1>being used to engineer the human genome</v>

1662
01:17:54.770 --> 01:17:57.140
<v Speaker 1>and make a baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't realize it was going to happen</v>

1663
01:17:57.141 --> 01:17:58.360
<v Speaker 1>within one year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1664
01:17:58.520 --> 01:18:03.110
<v Speaker 1>A lot of these technologies that I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to predict happened way faster</v>

1665
01:18:03.120 --> 01:18:03.930
<v Speaker 1>than even I think.</v>

1666
01:18:03.930 --> 01:18:06.890
<v Speaker 1>Is gonna happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think it's possibly happened in</v>

1667
01:18:06.891 --> 01:18:09.920
<v Speaker 1>other circumstances that they're not</v>
<v Speaker 1>going public with</v>

1668
01:18:11.710 --> 01:18:13.220
<v Speaker 1>it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's always possible.</v>

1669
01:18:14.160 --> 01:18:17.150
<v Speaker 1>That may be some human clones running</v>
<v Speaker 1>around right now that we don't know</v>

1670
01:18:17.151 --> 01:18:19.790
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think so it's certainly doable.</v>

1671
01:18:19.791 --> 01:18:21.680
<v Speaker 1>Scientifically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there might be some rogue nation who's</v>

1672
01:18:21.681 --> 01:18:23.750
<v Speaker 1>doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Barbara streisand's togs,</v>

1673
01:18:23.780 --> 01:18:26.490
<v Speaker 1>or were pretty easy to clone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1674
01:18:26.491 --> 01:18:28.040
<v Speaker 1>That she had her dogs cloned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1675
01:18:28.460 --> 01:18:29.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1676
01:18:29.601 --> 01:18:31.580
<v Speaker 1>Sammy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 14 year old dog is now,</v>

1677
01:18:31.670 --> 01:18:32.540
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's two of them.</v>

1678
01:18:33.350 --> 01:18:35.690
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is so weird.</v>

1679
01:18:35.691 --> 01:18:37.260
<v Speaker 1>That'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I'd be so scared,</v>

1680
01:18:37.261 --> 01:18:40.520
<v Speaker 1>I'd go to sleep and wake up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That thing will be hovering over my face</v>

1681
01:18:40.940 --> 01:18:43.430
<v Speaker 1>was red glowing eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1682
01:18:43.431 --> 01:18:45.300
<v Speaker 1>Wait till you have designed a cemetery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

1683
01:18:45.710 --> 01:18:47.420
<v Speaker 1>A friend of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Carlos Bustamante at Stanford,</v>

1684
01:18:47.450 --> 01:18:51.080
<v Speaker 1>we were entertaining the idea of making</v>
<v Speaker 1>dogs live longer,</v>

1685
01:18:51.410 --> 01:18:52.243
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>genetically.</v>

1686
01:18:52.250 --> 01:18:56.180
<v Speaker 1>So why would you want your family member</v>
<v Speaker 1>to only live 12 years?</v>

1687
01:18:56.540 --> 01:18:59.270
<v Speaker 1>I think about that man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My daughter's only two and he's such a</v>

1688
01:18:59.271 --> 01:19:00.820
<v Speaker 1>sweetie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1689
01:19:00.860 --> 01:19:04.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm sad that one day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I had to put my dog down recently</v>

1690
01:19:04.930 --> 01:19:09.470
<v Speaker 1>and who's 13?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was really a massive two and he</v>

1691
01:19:09.471 --> 01:19:12.770
<v Speaker 1>was struggling and I just think man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this two year old one day he's going to</v>

1692
01:19:12.771 --> 01:19:15.010
<v Speaker 1>be in that same sort of situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it isn't.</v>

1693
01:19:15.011 --> 01:19:17.490
<v Speaker 1>And so we have three dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My wife runs a therapy dog.</v>

1694
01:19:17.810 --> 01:19:22.070
<v Speaker 1>Streisand had her beloved dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Samantha cloned that crazy bitch.</v>

1695
01:19:22.100 --> 01:19:25.220
<v Speaker 1>Look at her two copies of one dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

1696
01:19:25.230 --> 01:19:28.060
<v Speaker 1>That's so strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much just get a new dog.</v>

1697
01:19:28.130 --> 01:19:30.170
<v Speaker 1>You fucking nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1698
01:19:30.190 --> 01:19:33.920
<v Speaker 1>so</v>
<v Speaker 1>we might be nuts in my household because</v>

1699
01:19:33.921 --> 01:19:36.290
<v Speaker 1>we were giving out dogs and a man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1700
01:19:36.770 --> 01:19:37.820
<v Speaker 1>and how's it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dylan?</v>

1701
01:19:37.940 --> 01:19:40.790
<v Speaker 1>How old's the dog?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The oldest dog is nine and he's still</v>

1702
01:19:40.820 --> 01:19:41.653
<v Speaker 1>doing fine.</v>

1703
01:19:42.040 --> 01:19:45.970
<v Speaker 1>How does he look different?</v>
<v Speaker 1>My wife says so these are anecdotes.</v>

1704
01:19:45.990 --> 01:19:50.120
<v Speaker 1>I'm not gonna publish them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm so alice has a therapy dog and</v>

1705
01:19:50.121 --> 01:19:54.290
<v Speaker 1>he has to go to hospitals and nursing</v>
<v Speaker 1>homes and if he has nmn according to my</v>

1706
01:19:54.291 --> 01:19:56.750
<v Speaker 1>wife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he can't be a therapy dog because he's</v>

1707
01:19:56.751 --> 01:19:57.890
<v Speaker 1>too excited.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's running around,</v>

1708
01:19:57.891 --> 01:19:59.750
<v Speaker 1>jumping around really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that,</v>

1709
01:19:59.780 --> 01:20:03.680
<v Speaker 1>that's anecdotal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that seems to fit with what others</v>

1710
01:20:03.681 --> 01:20:05.720
<v Speaker 1>have experienced too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1711
01:20:06.580 --> 01:20:09.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what we're hoping to have some</v>

1712
01:20:09.211 --> 01:20:12.420
<v Speaker 1>treatments for some pets are shortly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the companies that I'm working</v>

1713
01:20:12.421 --> 01:20:15.090
<v Speaker 1>with treatments for pets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1714
01:20:15.240 --> 01:20:16.740
<v Speaker 1>Well you got to think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

1715
01:20:16.770 --> 01:20:19.920
<v Speaker 1>dogs only live 13 years anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

1716
01:20:20.400 --> 01:20:22.800
<v Speaker 1>Well yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also we have a dog that has a kidney</v>

1717
01:20:22.801 --> 01:20:25.440
<v Speaker 1>defect and the vet says it's only going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to live five years,</v>

1718
01:20:25.830 --> 01:20:29.280
<v Speaker 1>so she's three now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the one you experiment on what</v>

1719
01:20:29.281 --> 01:20:31.170
<v Speaker 1>we experiment on on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on all of them.</v>

1720
01:20:31.171 --> 01:20:32.004
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>

1721
01:20:33.390 --> 01:20:37.080
<v Speaker 1>But what's the downside that's got to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>so uncomfortable for some people</v>

1722
01:20:37.081 --> 01:20:38.100
<v Speaker 1>listening to this right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1723
01:20:38.160 --> 01:20:40.110
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how to feel about that.</v>

1724
01:20:40.320 --> 01:20:41.490
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the downside?</v>

1725
01:20:41.700 --> 01:20:44.610
<v Speaker 1>If your dog has got a kidney defect and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's only going to probably live to be</v>

1726
01:20:44.611 --> 01:20:46.830
<v Speaker 1>nine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meanwhile the dog's going to live to be</v>

1727
01:20:46.831 --> 01:20:48.570
<v Speaker 1>a thousand years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1728
01:20:48.571 --> 01:20:51.810
<v Speaker 1>we'll say I'll come back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll let you know in the Lotus position,</v>

1729
01:20:51.811 --> 01:20:54.840
<v Speaker 1>meditating 100 years from now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you do?</v>

1730
01:20:54.841 --> 01:20:57.420
<v Speaker 1>If it starts talking to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that'd be great.</v>

1731
01:20:58.680 --> 01:20:59.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

1732
01:20:59.220 --> 01:21:04.220
<v Speaker 1>What do you do if you turn a dog into</v>
<v Speaker 1>some new kind of thing that lives 30 or</v>

1733
01:21:04.741 --> 01:21:07.560
<v Speaker 1>40 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you tell people?</v>

1734
01:21:07.650 --> 01:21:10.440
<v Speaker 1>Like if your dog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like right now you're talking about on</v>

1735
01:21:10.441 --> 01:21:13.140
<v Speaker 1>the podcast and for a bunch of people</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably going to remember,</v>

1736
01:21:13.141 --> 01:21:14.190
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of people for yet.</v>

1737
01:21:14.700 --> 01:21:16.680
<v Speaker 1>But if like 15,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 years from now,</v>

1738
01:21:16.681 --> 01:21:20.250
<v Speaker 1>your dog's still chasing balls and</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are going to come over your</v>

1739
01:21:20.251 --> 01:21:20.771
<v Speaker 1>house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey Dave,</v>

1740
01:21:20.771 --> 01:21:22.260
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck's going on with your dog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man?</v>

1741
01:21:22.480 --> 01:21:23.790
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same Dog.</v>

1742
01:21:23.810 --> 01:21:24.700
<v Speaker 1>That's Charlie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1743
01:21:24.840 --> 01:21:26.340
<v Speaker 1>How come Charlie doesn't have gray hair</v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore,</v>

1744
01:21:26.341 --> 01:21:27.180
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1745
01:21:27.240 --> 01:21:27.990
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1746
01:21:27.990 --> 01:21:29.730
<v Speaker 1>people ask have any gray hair?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1747
01:21:31.230 --> 01:21:31.681
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1748
01:21:31.681 --> 01:21:32.520
<v Speaker 1>that's weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

1749
01:21:32.580 --> 01:21:33.960
<v Speaker 1>You don't have any.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what you're driving.</v>

1750
01:21:34.050 --> 01:21:36.550
<v Speaker 1>How long have you been on this stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A wild rose virtual.</v>

1751
01:21:36.560 --> 01:21:40.740
<v Speaker 1>I started 12 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It form in about three years ago.</v>

1752
01:21:40.830 --> 01:21:42.570
<v Speaker 1>And a man about the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1753
01:21:43.200 --> 01:21:45.030
<v Speaker 1>Does anyone in your family have gray</v>
<v Speaker 1>hair?</v>

1754
01:21:45.140 --> 01:21:47.400
<v Speaker 1>Is it a genetic issue?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1755
01:21:48.060 --> 01:21:52.960
<v Speaker 1>my father has old gray hair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My brothers about the query to have</v>

1756
01:21:52.961 --> 01:21:53.720
<v Speaker 1>grade.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1757
01:21:53.720 --> 01:21:55.300
<v Speaker 1>Is your brother taking the stuff you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking?</v>

1758
01:21:55.810 --> 01:21:57.500
<v Speaker 1>Only recently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

1759
01:21:58.380 --> 01:21:59.700
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1760
01:21:59.701 --> 01:22:02.490
<v Speaker 1>we call that an n of three in an</v>
<v Speaker 1>experiment,</v>

1761
01:22:02.491 --> 01:22:03.810
<v Speaker 1>which is insufficient.</v>

1762
01:22:04.100 --> 01:22:05.640
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't want to get slapped on the</v>

1763
01:22:05.641 --> 01:22:07.840
<v Speaker 1>wrist by a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course with medical schools,</v>

1764
01:22:08.280 --> 01:22:11.040
<v Speaker 1>somebody who's saying all these things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just answering questions.</v>

1765
01:22:11.050 --> 01:22:11.940
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do not worry.</v>

1766
01:22:12.190 --> 01:22:13.380
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But so far so good.</v>

1767
01:22:13.410 --> 01:22:16.050
<v Speaker 1>If I'm around in another hundred years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll know something.</v>

1768
01:22:16.051 --> 01:22:18.600
<v Speaker 1>So that would be unbelievably</v>
<v Speaker 1>fascinating.</v>

1769
01:22:18.601 --> 01:22:20.880
<v Speaker 1>If your dog lived to be like 30 or 40</v>
<v Speaker 1>years old,</v>

1770
01:22:21.390 --> 01:22:25.250
<v Speaker 1>that would be really incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if I meet you in 15 years,</v>

1771
01:22:25.290 --> 01:22:26.510
<v Speaker 1>you still have dark hair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll be like,</v>

1772
01:22:26.511 --> 01:22:28.710
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the hell,</v>

1773
01:22:28.711 --> 01:22:33.060
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are the things are you taking?</v>

1774
01:22:33.061 --> 01:22:36.680
<v Speaker 1>Do you take multivitamins?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I take vitamin D,</v>

1775
01:22:37.080 --> 01:22:39.990
<v Speaker 1>that's it with Katie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just Vitamin D.</v>

1776
01:22:40.750 --> 01:22:43.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about e or k or any of those?</v>

1777
01:22:44.820 --> 01:22:46.620
<v Speaker 1>K Two and d together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's it.</v>

1778
01:22:46.890 --> 01:22:48.760
<v Speaker 1>Oh Hm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm,</v>

1779
01:22:48.761 --> 01:22:50.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm afraid of iron.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Afraid of it.</v>

1780
01:22:51.230 --> 01:22:52.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

1781
01:22:53.040 --> 01:22:54.960
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some results that I've seen</v>

1782
01:22:54.961 --> 01:22:56.970
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that excess iron,</v>

1783
01:22:57.420 --> 01:23:01.710
<v Speaker 1>especially in the elderly leads to</v>
<v Speaker 1>Senescence of cells and buildup of those</v>

1784
01:23:01.711 --> 01:23:02.790
<v Speaker 1>Zombie cells is a bad thing.</v>

1785
01:23:02.880 --> 01:23:07.880
<v Speaker 1>And is this a dietary iron from</v>
<v Speaker 1>vegetables or is it from cooking on a</v>

1786
01:23:08.231 --> 01:23:10.300
<v Speaker 1>cast iron pan or.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1787
01:23:10.870 --> 01:23:13.670
<v Speaker 1>I only know from correlation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm,</v>

1788
01:23:13.780 --> 01:23:16.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking at tissue that's full of</v>
<v Speaker 1>iron and the cells are not looking good.</v>

1789
01:23:16.961 --> 01:23:20.140
<v Speaker 1>So all I can think is I don't want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>overload myself on it.</v>

1790
01:23:20.190 --> 01:23:22.040
<v Speaker 1>So this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1791
01:23:22.490 --> 01:23:25.630
<v Speaker 1>hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much iron is too much iron?</v>

1792
01:23:26.590 --> 01:23:28.230
<v Speaker 1>We don't know yet because I always hear</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1793
01:23:28.240 --> 01:23:31.720
<v Speaker 1>especially from women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Iron deficiencies for some reason.</v>

1794
01:23:31.721 --> 01:23:32.554
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hear,</v>

1795
01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:35.650
<v Speaker 1>I've heard it from several women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1796
01:23:35.670 --> 01:23:36.510
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1797
01:23:36.850 --> 01:23:40.600
<v Speaker 1>but for the elderly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>overloading them with Ian I think is a</v>

1798
01:23:40.660 --> 01:23:43.450
<v Speaker 1>real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a sweet spot to hit.</v>

1799
01:23:43.690 --> 01:23:44.111
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1800
01:23:44.111 --> 01:23:45.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure there is.</v>

1801
01:23:45.430 --> 01:23:48.700
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the iron will will damage your cells</v>

1802
01:23:48.701 --> 01:23:53.170
<v Speaker 1>pretty badly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you don't want to go overboard and no</v>

1803
01:23:53.171 --> 01:23:56.290
<v Speaker 1>other supplements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I try to eat vegetables which</v>

1804
01:23:56.291 --> 01:24:00.100
<v Speaker 1>hopefully will make sure I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not deficient in anything.</v>

1805
01:24:01.360 --> 01:24:04.180
<v Speaker 1>Green leafy dark vegetables.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly,</v>

1806
01:24:04.360 --> 01:24:07.930
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I can call her straight out of the</v>

1807
01:24:07.931 --> 01:24:10.780
<v Speaker 1>fridge instead of going for the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for uh,</v>

1808
01:24:11.130 --> 01:24:11.680
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1809
01:24:11.680 --> 01:24:15.640
<v Speaker 1>piece of cooked meat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll go for a carrot or something.</v>

1810
01:24:16.030 --> 01:24:18.700
<v Speaker 1>Eight somebody carrots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll probably turn orange now.</v>

1811
01:24:18.701 --> 01:24:21.670
<v Speaker 1>Carrots have a little sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a great.</v>

1812
01:24:21.910 --> 01:24:23.410
<v Speaker 1>Now I've got to cut out my carrots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1813
01:24:23.411 --> 01:24:24.880
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you drink them in the</v>

1814
01:24:24.881 --> 01:24:27.340
<v Speaker 1>juice form,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I know a lot of friends who really</v>

1815
01:24:27.341 --> 01:24:30.640
<v Speaker 1>enjoy fruit juices and vegetable juices.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I always say,</v>

1816
01:24:30.641 --> 01:24:32.710
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean at vegetable Jews,</v>

1817
01:24:32.711 --> 01:24:34.240
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's probably great,</v>

1818
01:24:34.270 --> 01:24:37.660
<v Speaker 1>but fruit juice man drinking a big glass</v>
<v Speaker 1>of orange juice,</v>

1819
01:24:37.661 --> 01:24:39.910
<v Speaker 1>you might as well be having a Coca Cola.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1820
01:24:40.200 --> 01:24:40.690
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

1821
01:24:40.690 --> 01:24:45.690
<v Speaker 1>So our household has a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a ban on smoothies and fruit juices and</v>

1822
01:24:47.891 --> 01:24:51.190
<v Speaker 1>sodas that have sugar in them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God used to be able to go to like Jamba</v>

1823
01:24:51.191 --> 01:24:54.670
<v Speaker 1>juice and get one of those big Ole</v>
<v Speaker 1>smoothies and feel like you're doing</v>

1824
01:24:54.671 --> 01:24:55.930
<v Speaker 1>something good for your body.</v>

1825
01:24:56.440 --> 01:24:57.430
<v Speaker 1>I used to think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1826
01:24:57.431 --> 01:24:59.380
<v Speaker 1>look it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got all this blueberries in there and</v>

1827
01:24:59.381 --> 01:25:02.410
<v Speaker 1>great stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But meanwhile there's just a gang of</v>

1828
01:25:02.411 --> 01:25:04.090
<v Speaker 1>sugar in that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1829
01:25:04.150 --> 01:25:07.120
<v Speaker 1>I had an interesting thing that that</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole milk is actually potentially</v>

1830
01:25:07.121 --> 01:25:11.040
<v Speaker 1>better for you than the low fat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll use less of it and it doesn't,</v>

1831
01:25:11.050 --> 01:25:12.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>milk has some sugar in it.</v>

1832
01:25:12.790 --> 01:25:15.160
<v Speaker 1>It's also attached the fat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1833
01:25:15.190 --> 01:25:17.740
<v Speaker 1>The whole milk has fat in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's normal.</v>

1834
01:25:17.830 --> 01:25:19.630
<v Speaker 1>It's normal for your body to consume it</v>
<v Speaker 1>that way.</v>

1835
01:25:19.750 --> 01:25:20.240
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

1836
01:25:20.240 --> 01:25:23.680
<v Speaker 1>What I want is I want my money back from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the nutritionists in the 19 seventies</v>

1837
01:25:23.681 --> 01:25:26.740
<v Speaker 1>and eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I skipped eggs and Bacon.</v>

1838
01:25:26.760 --> 01:25:29.590
<v Speaker 1>It could have been eating that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While you remember that food pyramid</v>

1839
01:25:29.591 --> 01:25:33.340
<v Speaker 1>that used to be in the Dr Seuss books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're teaching kids to eat cereal,</v>

1840
01:25:33.830 --> 01:25:36.700
<v Speaker 1>you know it's so crazy and put</v>
<v Speaker 1>monitoring on your bread.</v>

1841
01:25:36.820 --> 01:25:39.150
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the best stuff.</v>

1842
01:25:39.190 --> 01:25:43.000
<v Speaker 1>The best bad advice that they ever gave</v>
<v Speaker 1>vegetable oils,</v>

1843
01:25:43.001 --> 01:25:46.870
<v Speaker 1>which are fucking terrible for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All those disgusting vegetables,</v>

1844
01:25:46.871 --> 01:25:50.050
<v Speaker 1>safflower and corn oil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that stuff.</v>

1845
01:25:50.051 --> 01:25:53.230
<v Speaker 1>That's just terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Terrible for you.</v>

1846
01:25:53.260 --> 01:25:55.440
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other thing that that mothers used</v>

1847
01:25:55.441 --> 01:25:58.780
<v Speaker 1>to to some extent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>still tell their kids is don't go</v>

1848
01:25:58.781 --> 01:26:00.640
<v Speaker 1>hungry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have a snack.</v>

1849
01:26:00.750 --> 01:26:03.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't say mother's parents in,</v>

1850
01:26:03.380 --> 01:26:08.270
<v Speaker 1>but in my family it's my wife.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She hates to see our kids go hungry at</v>

1851
01:26:08.271 --> 01:26:09.980
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's always ate eight,</v>

1852
01:26:09.981 --> 01:26:11.420
<v Speaker 1>ate never be hungry and I'm there</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

1853
01:26:11.450 --> 01:26:12.201
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be hungry.</v>

1854
01:26:12.201 --> 01:26:15.440
<v Speaker 1>It's good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's this tension with children</v>

1855
01:26:15.441 --> 01:26:16.940
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because children are growing.</v>

1856
01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.460
<v Speaker 1>I always assume that children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they should just eat whenever they're</v>

1857
01:26:19.461 --> 01:26:20.750
<v Speaker 1>hungry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1858
01:26:20.751 --> 01:26:24.440
<v Speaker 1>that's what stated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure if that's</v>

1859
01:26:26.570 --> 01:26:29.300
<v Speaker 1>the case often.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My son is somewhat.</v>

1860
01:26:29.530 --> 01:26:32.990
<v Speaker 1>My son isn't thin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Put it that way and he'll be going out</v>

1861
01:26:32.991 --> 01:26:36.050
<v Speaker 1>the door and my wife will say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have you had breakfast now?</v>

1862
01:26:36.050 --> 01:26:38.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm not hungry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to eat something,</v>

1863
01:26:38.420 --> 01:26:39.650
<v Speaker 1>and I'm thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1864
01:26:39.651 --> 01:26:42.260
<v Speaker 1>you got plenty of energy stored there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't worry about it.</v>

1865
01:26:43.550 --> 01:26:45.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it makes sense.</v>

1866
01:26:45.560 --> 01:26:49.520
<v Speaker 1>The only thing that I think of is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're a young person,</v>

1867
01:26:49.521 --> 01:26:54.350
<v Speaker 1>your body is still actually growing and</v>
<v Speaker 1>developing as opposed to you and I.</v>

1868
01:26:54.860 --> 01:26:56.930
<v Speaker 1>If we're fasting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes sense.</v>

1869
01:26:56.960 --> 01:26:57.741
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes sense.</v>

1870
01:26:57.741 --> 01:26:59.750
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're giving your body a break and</v>

1871
01:26:59.751 --> 01:27:03.980
<v Speaker 1>there's all sorts of proven benefits to</v>
<v Speaker 1>that fasting process and well,</v>

1872
01:27:03.981 --> 01:27:08.480
<v Speaker 1>if you have a child who's overweight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it isn't a bad thing to skip a meal.</v>

1873
01:27:09.230 --> 01:27:10.250
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1874
01:27:10.251 --> 01:27:11.660
<v Speaker 1>It's not the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The one,</v>

1875
01:27:11.670 --> 01:27:14.870
<v Speaker 1>the thing that worries me about children</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are overweight skipping a meal</v>

1876
01:27:14.871 --> 01:27:19.460
<v Speaker 1>though is that they're not as</v>
<v Speaker 1>disciplined and they're not so good</v>

1877
01:27:19.461 --> 01:27:23.790
<v Speaker 1>psychologically with struggling and</v>
<v Speaker 1>having know,</v>

1878
01:27:24.620 --> 01:27:28.360
<v Speaker 1>having hunger pangs and that you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to fuck their head up straight.</v>

1879
01:27:28.410 --> 01:27:32.030
<v Speaker 1>The teachers are probably be very angry</v>
<v Speaker 1>with me that the kids can't concentrate</v>

1880
01:27:32.150 --> 01:27:33.380
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not just that.</v>

1881
01:27:33.381 --> 01:27:34.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the kids can't concentrate,</v>

1882
01:27:34.821 --> 01:27:38.060
<v Speaker 1>but I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I worry that it's in some way shape or</v>

1883
01:27:38.061 --> 01:27:39.710
<v Speaker 1>form abusive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like to say,</v>

1884
01:27:39.711 --> 01:27:40.850
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're overweight,</v>

1885
01:27:40.910 --> 01:27:43.720
<v Speaker 1>you need to lose weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't think they're like,</v>

1886
01:27:44.080 --> 01:27:49.080
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they're really designed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>go without the way way a grown adult</v>

1887
01:27:50.331 --> 01:27:51.680
<v Speaker 1>does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are my own perceptions.</v>

1888
01:27:51.830 --> 01:27:56.420
<v Speaker 1>I think that it's probably far better to</v>
<v Speaker 1>adjust their diet and if you've got a</v>

1889
01:27:56.421 --> 01:28:01.421
<v Speaker 1>kid just slowly get their body weight</v>
<v Speaker 1>down with exercise,</v>

1890
01:28:01.641 --> 01:28:06.260
<v Speaker 1>particularly with resistance training</v>
<v Speaker 1>and doing things that really burn off a</v>

1891
01:28:06.261 --> 01:28:10.130
<v Speaker 1>lot of calories and then just get them</v>
<v Speaker 1>off the sugar and then I think the way</v>

1892
01:28:10.131 --> 01:28:14.180
<v Speaker 1>it'll slowly slip off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably not even so slowly if you can</v>

1893
01:28:14.181 --> 01:28:16.400
<v Speaker 1>really get them off a significant sugar</v>
<v Speaker 1>binge.</v>

1894
01:28:16.970 --> 01:28:19.550
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's why I'm taking my son to the</v>

1895
01:28:19.551 --> 01:28:20.750
<v Speaker 1>gym as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree with that.</v>

1896
01:28:20.810 --> 01:28:21.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

1897
01:28:21.500 --> 01:28:24.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just to clarify because I don't want a</v>

1898
01:28:24.171 --> 01:28:27.200
<v Speaker 1>bunch of hate mail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All I'm saying is don't force feed a</v>

1899
01:28:27.201 --> 01:28:28.220
<v Speaker 1>kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

1900
01:28:28.310 --> 01:28:29.061
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1901
01:28:29.061 --> 01:28:30.680
<v Speaker 1>Don't force feed a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1902
01:28:30.681 --> 01:28:33.290
<v Speaker 1>I agree with that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I just think that kids,</v>

1903
01:28:33.910 --> 01:28:35.660
<v Speaker 1>they just get so fucking hungry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1904
01:28:35.690 --> 01:28:38.600
<v Speaker 1>They get their little bodies are like</v>
<v Speaker 1>little hummingbirds.</v>

1905
01:28:39.180 --> 01:28:41.930
<v Speaker 1>No burning so much energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1906
01:28:41.931 --> 01:28:43.180
<v Speaker 1>they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm amazing.</v>

1907
01:28:43.190 --> 01:28:45.770
<v Speaker 1>You don't take any other supplements?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just vitamin D?</v>

1908
01:28:45.800 --> 01:28:48.020
<v Speaker 1>No multivitamins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to like cover all your</v>

1909
01:28:48.021 --> 01:28:50.190
<v Speaker 1>bases?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No whole food supplements,</v>

1910
01:28:50.191 --> 01:28:54.680
<v Speaker 1>like vitamin A or a plant based</v>
<v Speaker 1>supplement that you can take during the</v>

1911
01:28:54.680 --> 01:28:55.840
<v Speaker 1>day?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1912
01:28:56.240 --> 01:28:59.490
<v Speaker 1>none of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1913
01:29:00.050 --> 01:29:01.980
<v Speaker 1>I've subscribed the idea that a lot of</v>

1914
01:29:01.980 --> 01:29:06.840
<v Speaker 2>it's expensive urine and Nope,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm testing myself so I know if I'm</v>

1915
01:29:06.841 --> 01:29:11.400
<v Speaker 2>deficient in something bad and all my</v>
<v Speaker 2>vitals or close to optimal.</v>

1916
01:29:12.480 --> 01:29:15.450
<v Speaker 2>So if something's out of whack out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>see it probably.</v>

1917
01:29:16.410 --> 01:29:19.650
<v Speaker 2>So you were saying you do things for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>government.</v>

1918
01:29:21.150 --> 01:29:22.610
<v Speaker 2>What did I say that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1919
01:29:22.611 --> 01:29:25.440
<v Speaker 2>you said that earlier you said I should</v>
<v Speaker 2>ask you on.</v>

1920
01:29:25.441 --> 01:29:30.060
<v Speaker 2>I didn't really did in for the show</v>
<v Speaker 2>started as was outside.</v>

1921
01:29:33.330 --> 01:29:36.270
<v Speaker 2>I was feeling frisky now that I've</v>
<v Speaker 2>thought about it,</v>

1922
01:29:36.360 --> 01:29:38.570
<v Speaker 2>a sign to go to jail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll,</v>

1923
01:29:38.640 --> 01:29:40.260
<v Speaker 2>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll talk about the.</v>

1924
01:29:40.261 --> 01:29:44.430
<v Speaker 2>A good idea to get you in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's pause and think this for a</v>

1925
01:29:44.431 --> 01:29:45.600
<v Speaker 2>moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There,</v>

1926
01:29:45.610 --> 01:29:47.490
<v Speaker 2>things that you can't talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>please don't.</v>

1927
01:29:47.860 --> 01:29:49.470
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot to talk about.</v>

1928
01:29:49.940 --> 01:29:53.130
<v Speaker 2>I just have to make sure it's nothing</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's confidential,</v>

1929
01:29:53.131 --> 01:29:56.190
<v Speaker 2>but there's a lot of interesting stuff</v>
<v Speaker 2>going on on the planet.</v>

1930
01:29:56.340 --> 01:29:58.770
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's areas of biodefense that are</v>

1931
01:29:58.771 --> 01:29:59.970
<v Speaker 2>pretty scary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Also.</v>

1932
01:29:59.971 --> 01:30:04.971
<v Speaker 2>Some nations are apparently working on</v>
<v Speaker 2>using crispr and other gene editing</v>

1933
01:30:06.121 --> 01:30:10.830
<v Speaker 2>systems and modifying bugs that could</v>
<v Speaker 2>wipe out a few hundred million people</v>

1934
01:30:10.831 --> 01:30:12.570
<v Speaker 2>pretty quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you do?</v>

1935
01:30:12.571 --> 01:30:13.760
<v Speaker 2>How do you detect that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1936
01:30:13.950 --> 01:30:16.710
<v Speaker 2>even the flu,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a massive by threat and it may</v>

1937
01:30:16.711 --> 01:30:19.580
<v Speaker 2>just be natural and that could wipe out</v>
<v Speaker 2>another 100 million people.</v>

1938
01:30:19.581 --> 01:30:22.620
<v Speaker 2>I can data exactly a century ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1939
01:30:22.621 --> 01:30:23.760
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I work on that stuff.</v>

1940
01:30:23.820 --> 01:30:26.300
<v Speaker 2>I'm detecting viruses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

1941
01:30:26.460 --> 01:30:29.100
<v Speaker 2>wiping them out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cleaning a room of DNA,</v>

1942
01:30:29.160 --> 01:30:32.160
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>making sure that everything's clean.</v>

1943
01:30:32.640 --> 01:30:34.560
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'll give you an example so that the</v>

1944
01:30:34.620 --> 01:30:36.820
<v Speaker 2>navy seals came out to my lab,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1945
01:30:36.880 --> 01:30:40.620
<v Speaker 2>and they like to ask him how our group</v>
<v Speaker 2>to solve some hard problems.</v>

1946
01:30:40.621 --> 01:30:45.150
<v Speaker 2>And so the problem they set us on was</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you kill anthrax?</v>

1947
01:30:45.530 --> 01:30:47.700
<v Speaker 2>I'm safely now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right now,</v>

1948
01:30:47.701 --> 01:30:48.660
<v Speaker 2>it's very difficult to kill.</v>

1949
01:30:48.660 --> 01:30:50.880
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the anthrax letter was opened in</v>

1950
01:30:50.881 --> 01:30:52.240
<v Speaker 2>the Senate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was it,</v>

1951
01:30:52.320 --> 01:30:54.990
<v Speaker 2>a number of years ago?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It cost $25,000,000.</v>

1952
01:30:54.991 --> 01:30:57.810
<v Speaker 2>They had to seal it off and put hydrogen</v>
<v Speaker 2>peroxide all over.</v>

1953
01:30:57.930 --> 01:31:01.140
<v Speaker 2>Everything destroyed the computers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they're wondering how do you kill</v>

1954
01:31:01.141 --> 01:31:04.830
<v Speaker 2>anthrax safely so that you don't have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be in a hazmat suit to do it.</v>

1955
01:31:05.490 --> 01:31:10.490
<v Speaker 2>And so what we came up with after</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking about it for about a week was</v>

1956
01:31:11.610 --> 01:31:13.470
<v Speaker 2>we need a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a biological solution,</v>

1957
01:31:13.471 --> 01:31:16.050
<v Speaker 2>not a chemical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we found a,</v>

1958
01:31:16.380 --> 01:31:18.530
<v Speaker 2>an organism that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1959
01:31:18.740 --> 01:31:22.230
<v Speaker 2>where its whereabouts I cannot disclose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a very interesting organism</v>

1960
01:31:22.231 --> 01:31:27.231
<v Speaker 2>that grows at high temperature and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>destroys all bacterial and viral life.</v>

1961
01:31:27.890 --> 01:31:29.970
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it wipes it out and it doesn't hurt</v>

1962
01:31:29.971 --> 01:31:32.830
<v Speaker 2>humans at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You as a,</v>

1963
01:31:32.910 --> 01:31:34.920
<v Speaker 2>or at least an animal studies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can breathe it in,</v>

1964
01:31:34.921 --> 01:31:36.330
<v Speaker 2>you can put it anywhere and it's fine.</v>

1965
01:31:36.690 --> 01:31:41.690
<v Speaker 2>So this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a cocktail of enzymes that destroys the</v>

1966
01:31:42.061 --> 01:31:44.130
<v Speaker 2>microbes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including anthrax.</v>

1967
01:31:44.880 --> 01:31:49.200
<v Speaker 2>So it doesn't have any effect on humans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what about the bacteria that lives</v>

1968
01:31:49.201 --> 01:31:51.480
<v Speaker 2>in our body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our will,</v>

1969
01:31:51.481 --> 01:31:54.840
<v Speaker 2>we haven't eaten it yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What we're hoping to do is to do a</v>

1970
01:31:54.841 --> 01:31:57.480
<v Speaker 2>clinical trial soon on removing</v>
<v Speaker 2>biofilms.</v>

1971
01:31:57.720 --> 01:32:01.180
<v Speaker 2>So in the wounds of patients,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the problem that they,</v>

1972
01:32:01.240 --> 01:32:03.490
<v Speaker 2>the reason they don't heal very well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially these diabetic,</v>

1973
01:32:03.491 --> 01:32:05.500
<v Speaker 2>chronic wounds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that by the way,</v>

1974
01:32:05.560 --> 01:32:07.240
<v Speaker 2>that every 10 minutes someone's losing a</v>
<v Speaker 2>limb,</v>

1975
01:32:07.241 --> 01:32:09.460
<v Speaker 2>thanks to that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these biofilms,</v>

1976
01:32:09.461 --> 01:32:12.100
<v Speaker 2>you have to digest them off and do you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know how they do it right now?</v>

1977
01:32:12.790 --> 01:32:14.740
<v Speaker 2>They scrub them off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's horrific.</v>

1978
01:32:14.890 --> 01:32:17.830
<v Speaker 2>Then they cut the skin and they keep</v>
<v Speaker 2>cutting and cutting and eventually you</v>

1979
01:32:17.831 --> 01:32:21.010
<v Speaker 2>lose a limb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This looks really promising in animal</v>

1980
01:32:21.011 --> 01:32:25.450
<v Speaker 2>studies that we should be able to not</v>
<v Speaker 2>just kill the bacteria in the wound,</v>

1981
01:32:25.660 --> 01:32:28.240
<v Speaker 2>which is a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but get rid of that biofilm.</v>

1982
01:32:28.750 --> 01:32:31.330
<v Speaker 2>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So things like Murcia</v>

1983
01:32:33.190 --> 01:32:35.860
<v Speaker 2>staph infections,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

1984
01:32:36.110 --> 01:32:39.610
<v Speaker 2>Be Able to stop it in its tracks before</v>
<v Speaker 2>it gets systemic,</v>

1985
01:32:39.640 --> 01:32:42.210
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Spray that stuff on a cruise line for is</v>

1986
01:32:42.400 --> 01:32:44.140
<v Speaker 2>for the virus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a norovirus.</v>

1987
01:32:44.680 --> 01:32:47.080
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if it turns out to be that safe,</v>

1988
01:32:47.081 --> 01:32:51.250
<v Speaker 2>why not just wiped down schools?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1989
01:32:51.970 --> 01:32:54.700
<v Speaker 2>because I was worried about the negative</v>
<v Speaker 2>aspect,</v>

1990
01:32:54.701 --> 01:32:56.490
<v Speaker 2>like what's going to happen?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what's,</v>

1991
01:32:56.520 --> 01:32:58.480
<v Speaker 2>what's going to be the blowback,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1992
01:32:58.510 --> 01:33:03.510
<v Speaker 2>Like antibiotics is what's created</v>
<v Speaker 2>medicine resistant antibiotic for staph</v>

1993
01:33:06.251 --> 01:33:07.090
<v Speaker 2>infections.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

1994
01:33:07.390 --> 01:33:08.260
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1995
01:33:08.290 --> 01:33:10.380
<v Speaker 2>Your mind always jumps to the worst</v>
<v Speaker 2>possible scenario.</v>

1996
01:33:11.030 --> 01:33:13.120
<v Speaker 2>Love it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'd make a good,</v>

1997
01:33:13.180 --> 01:33:15.110
<v Speaker 2>good team.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm the,</v>

1998
01:33:15.111 --> 01:33:16.870
<v Speaker 2>I got a buddy cop movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1999
01:33:16.960 --> 01:33:18.820
<v Speaker 2>let's do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2000
01:33:19.410 --> 01:33:21.880
<v Speaker 2>so we've tested,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does it induce antibiotic resistance?</v>

2001
01:33:21.881 --> 01:33:23.850
<v Speaker 2>And so far it's negative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mm.</v>

2002
01:33:23.980 --> 01:33:25.000
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting.</v>

2003
01:33:25.480 --> 01:33:26.500
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>another thing I'll tell you.</v>

2004
01:33:28.210 --> 01:33:31.750
<v Speaker 2>So I work with a company that detects</v>
<v Speaker 2>organisms,</v>

2005
01:33:31.840 --> 01:33:34.540
<v Speaker 2>so we want to detect if there's another</v>
<v Speaker 2>virus coming across the planet.</v>

2006
01:33:34.930 --> 01:33:36.730
<v Speaker 2>So how do you do that quickly?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2007
01:33:36.750 --> 01:33:38.710
<v Speaker 2>and how do you do it if you don't know</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you're looking for.</v>

2008
01:33:39.220 --> 01:33:44.220
<v Speaker 2>So we can take a drop of blood or a swab</v>
<v Speaker 2>off the table and we can see all the</v>

2009
01:33:44.231 --> 01:33:47.050
<v Speaker 2>organisms that are there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can do your microbiome,</v>

2010
01:33:47.051 --> 01:33:50.140
<v Speaker 2>but that's easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can do a drop of blood,</v>

2011
01:33:50.141 --> 01:33:52.660
<v Speaker 2>will tell you all the bacteria and</v>
<v Speaker 2>viruses in there.</v>

2012
01:33:53.170 --> 01:33:58.000
<v Speaker 2>And it'll tell you how to kill it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is great for health care because</v>

2013
01:33:58.001 --> 01:34:00.280
<v Speaker 2>right now microbiology labs I've worked</v>
<v Speaker 2>in one.</v>

2014
01:34:00.281 --> 01:34:05.230
<v Speaker 2>I used to swap urine and poop on plates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was very glamorous.</v>

2015
01:34:05.830 --> 01:34:07.270
<v Speaker 2>That's how it still done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is,</v>

2016
01:34:07.460 --> 01:34:10.780
<v Speaker 2>that's 19th century,</v>
<v Speaker 2>early 20th century technology growing on</v>

2017
01:34:10.781 --> 01:34:12.370
<v Speaker 2>a plate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wait a few days,</v>

2018
01:34:12.371 --> 01:34:15.010
<v Speaker 2>see what grows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's useless for diseases like</v>

2019
01:34:15.011 --> 01:34:17.560
<v Speaker 2>viruses and lyme disease,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lyme disease.</v>

2020
01:34:17.561 --> 01:34:19.780
<v Speaker 2>You know the one from ticks in your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in your spine.</v>

2021
01:34:20.650 --> 01:34:24.700
<v Speaker 2>My daughter got lyme disease and she was</v>
<v Speaker 2>really sick.</v>

2022
01:34:24.701 --> 01:34:26.990
<v Speaker 2>She was losing her eyesight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was serious.</v>

2023
01:34:26.991 --> 01:34:30.430
<v Speaker 2>It got into her brain and the hospital</v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't give her the antibiotic because</v>

2024
01:34:30.431 --> 01:34:33.130
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the tests weren't quick enough and they</v>

2025
01:34:33.131 --> 01:34:36.640
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't give her the antibiotic until</v>
<v Speaker 2>the test were positive for insurance</v>

2026
01:34:36.641 --> 01:34:39.220
<v Speaker 2>reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I said just Gimme that Gimme the DNA</v>

2027
01:34:39.221 --> 01:34:41.110
<v Speaker 2>of my daughter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the spinal fluid,</v>

2028
01:34:41.500 --> 01:34:42.910
<v Speaker 2>I'll test it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They wouldn't do that.</v>

2029
01:34:43.300 --> 01:34:47.920
<v Speaker 2>So I was furious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I spun out a company out of my lab</v>

2030
01:34:48.340 --> 01:34:49.530
<v Speaker 2>with some very smart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2031
01:34:49.690 --> 01:34:52.270
<v Speaker 2>bioinformaticians mathematicians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>software engineers.</v>

2032
01:34:52.790 --> 01:34:54.970
<v Speaker 2>We built supercomputers to be able to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

2033
01:34:55.540 --> 01:34:57.620
<v Speaker 2>Teamed up with a guy in Stanford,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my friend,</v>

2034
01:34:57.621 --> 01:34:57.980
<v Speaker 2>I mentioned</v>

2035
01:34:57.980 --> 01:34:59.030
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Carlos Bustamante.</v>

2036
01:34:59.031 --> 01:35:00.890
<v Speaker 1>He's the guy that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did.</v>

2037
01:35:00.920 --> 01:35:02.120
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2038
01:35:02.121 --> 01:35:04.130
<v Speaker 1>maybe I shouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he did a famous person's genome</v>

2039
01:35:04.131 --> 01:35:05.450
<v Speaker 1>recently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2040
01:35:05.540 --> 01:35:07.150
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'd been trained on mummy's,</v>

2041
01:35:07.380 --> 01:35:09.530
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he did Kennewick man.</v>

2042
01:35:09.531 --> 01:35:14.531
<v Speaker 1>And so this technology can be teamed up</v>
<v Speaker 1>with what I've done to be able to get</v>

2043
01:35:15.501 --> 01:35:17.210
<v Speaker 1>rid of all the human dna out of blood</v>
<v Speaker 1>sample,</v>

2044
01:35:17.570 --> 01:35:19.220
<v Speaker 1>leave the viruses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lead the bacteria,</v>

2045
01:35:19.910 --> 01:35:22.100
<v Speaker 1>and then run that through a second super</v>
<v Speaker 1>computer,</v>

2046
01:35:22.190 --> 01:35:27.190
<v Speaker 1>all the DNA and tell you within probably</v>
<v Speaker 1>seconds eventually what it is.</v>

2047
01:35:27.500 --> 01:35:31.340
<v Speaker 1>So my daughter would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would have a diagnosis within eventually</v>

2048
01:35:31.341 --> 01:35:33.560
<v Speaker 1>will be just 10 minutes instead of</v>
<v Speaker 1>waiting a week.</v>

2049
01:35:33.680 --> 01:35:37.130
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lyme diseases terrifying.</v>

2050
01:35:37.480 --> 01:35:38.930
<v Speaker 1>There are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are so many people that are</v>

2051
01:35:38.931 --> 01:35:43.820
<v Speaker 1>infected with it and I know personally</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe 10 people that have it and a</v>

2052
01:35:43.821 --> 01:35:48.170
<v Speaker 1>couple that have had significant issues</v>
<v Speaker 1>with it that have lasted for years.</v>

2053
01:35:48.200 --> 01:35:51.670
<v Speaker 1>I know a guy who was hospitalized for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>full year on it lights.</v>

2054
01:35:51.710 --> 01:35:54.020
<v Speaker 1>It's really bad and it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it can hide as well.</v>

2055
01:35:54.021 --> 01:35:55.220
<v Speaker 1>That's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2056
01:35:55.221 --> 01:35:56.200
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it,</v>

2057
01:35:56.201 --> 01:35:59.530
<v Speaker 1>it wrecks joints.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that thought,</v>

2058
01:35:59.660 --> 01:36:02.270
<v Speaker 1>a lot of countries have actually deny</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they have lung disease.</v>

2059
01:36:02.271 --> 01:36:05.620
<v Speaker 1>Australia's a good example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People getting what seems to be lyme</v>

2060
01:36:05.621 --> 01:36:07.760
<v Speaker 1>disease and no one knows if it is or</v>
<v Speaker 1>not.</v>

2061
01:36:08.420 --> 01:36:10.250
<v Speaker 1>Give those samples to us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll tell you what's in there.</v>

2062
01:36:10.490 --> 01:36:13.640
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems to be very difficult with</v>

2063
01:36:13.670 --> 01:36:18.620
<v Speaker 1>certain doctors for them to tell if they</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't see that bullseye infection.</v>

2064
01:36:19.190 --> 01:36:20.840
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So my daughter,</v>

2065
01:36:20.841 --> 01:36:22.670
<v Speaker 1>our daughter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Natalie and middle daughter,</v>

2066
01:36:23.390 --> 01:36:24.830
<v Speaker 1>she didn't have a bullseye.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She had nothing.</v>

2067
01:36:24.831 --> 01:36:26.520
<v Speaker 1>The first thing we need to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2068
01:36:26.540 --> 01:36:29.060
<v Speaker 1>so it's inflammation around the bite of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the tick,</v>

2069
01:36:29.320 --> 01:36:30.350
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

2070
01:36:30.650 --> 01:36:31.280
<v Speaker 1>and there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2071
01:36:31.280 --> 01:36:35.090
<v Speaker 1>there's the actual bite and then there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>a circle on the outside of it.</v>

2072
01:36:35.150 --> 01:36:38.240
<v Speaker 1>And for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this occurs with lyme disease,</v>

2073
01:36:38.241 --> 01:36:42.380
<v Speaker 1>but oftentimes goes away quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you bring a person in and they</v>

2074
01:36:42.381 --> 01:36:44.390
<v Speaker 1>have the lyme disease,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't have that bullseye</v>

2075
01:36:44.391 --> 01:36:46.340
<v Speaker 1>anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what happened to my friend</v>

2076
01:36:46.341 --> 01:36:49.040
<v Speaker 1>Steve Son,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he tried to tell them that it was lyme</v>

2077
01:36:49.041 --> 01:36:49.970
<v Speaker 1>disease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

2078
01:36:49.971 --> 01:36:52.100
<v Speaker 1>the doctors were incredulous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't believe him.</v>

2079
01:36:52.410 --> 01:36:56.090
<v Speaker 1>And it took until the kid had bell's</v>
<v Speaker 1>palsy at his face.</v>

2080
01:36:56.600 --> 01:36:58.670
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what happened in our family.</v>

2081
01:36:58.790 --> 01:37:03.740
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I was bitten by a tick last year,</v>

2082
01:37:03.860 --> 01:37:06.500
<v Speaker 1>right behind the knee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it didn't form a bullseye.</v>

2083
01:37:06.890 --> 01:37:10.040
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I didn't give it time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it definitely was very painful</v>

2084
01:37:10.041 --> 01:37:11.090
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2085
01:37:11.160 --> 01:37:12.980
<v Speaker 1>I could tell that there was something</v>
<v Speaker 1>going on.</v>

2086
01:37:12.981 --> 01:37:16.100
<v Speaker 1>It was really itchy and I went to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>pharmacy and I said,</v>

2087
01:37:16.940 --> 01:37:18.050
<v Speaker 1>can I have the antibiotic?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2088
01:37:18.080 --> 01:37:19.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's probably costs a few dollars for</v>

2089
01:37:19.941 --> 01:37:20.774
<v Speaker 1>the antibiotic.</v>

2090
01:37:21.170 --> 01:37:22.003
<v Speaker 1>And they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2091
01:37:22.010 --> 01:37:25.670
<v Speaker 1>we won't give it to you till we see a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bullseye and you need to bring the</v>

2092
01:37:25.671 --> 01:37:27.350
<v Speaker 1>ticket.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While I didn't bring the tick with me.</v>

2093
01:37:27.860 --> 01:37:29.600
<v Speaker 1>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the doctors and nurses.</v>

2094
01:37:29.601 --> 01:37:31.700
<v Speaker 1>Worst nightmare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't leave until they gave me the</v>

2095
01:37:31.701 --> 01:37:33.830
<v Speaker 1>antibiotic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm glad because I don't want to</v>

2096
01:37:33.980 --> 01:37:35.810
<v Speaker 1>wait till I give it to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They did.</v>

2097
01:37:35.811 --> 01:37:38.030
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't going to leave until I got it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2098
01:37:38.330 --> 01:37:39.770
<v Speaker 1>but I don't want to wait a week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2099
01:37:39.771 --> 01:37:42.740
<v Speaker 1>I'm starting to lose my.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you get upset with them to say,</v>

2100
01:37:42.741 --> 01:37:43.970
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you dumb mother fuckers.</v>

2101
01:37:44.330 --> 01:37:46.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm super smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I work with jeans.</v>

2102
01:37:47.210 --> 01:37:49.640
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2103
01:37:49.730 --> 01:37:51.200
<v Speaker 1>Not that occasion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's tempting.</v>

2104
01:37:51.201 --> 01:37:52.330
<v Speaker 1>It's tempting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2105
01:37:52.370 --> 01:37:53.330
<v Speaker 1>you can always say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

2106
01:37:53.331 --> 01:37:56.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm a professor at Harvard and then they</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably just really kick you out.</v>

2107
01:37:57.870 --> 01:37:59.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you say?</v>

2108
01:37:59.491 --> 01:38:01.170
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how long did it take before they</v>

2109
01:38:01.171 --> 01:38:02.004
<v Speaker 1>listened to you?</v>

2110
01:38:03.140 --> 01:38:04.400
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I went through,</v>

2111
01:38:04.560 --> 01:38:07.410
<v Speaker 1>I basically started spouting biology so</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they knew their.</v>

2112
01:38:07.411 --> 01:38:09.440
<v Speaker 1>I knew something about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2113
01:38:09.530 --> 01:38:10.940
<v Speaker 1>it was about 15 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2114
01:38:10.950 --> 01:38:13.170
<v Speaker 1>that's not bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He knew what to say.</v>

2115
01:38:14.040 --> 01:38:17.010
<v Speaker 1>It be there for days by Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trust me.</v>

2116
01:38:17.850 --> 01:38:19.250
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me draw you a picture of the tick.</v>

2117
01:38:20.500 --> 01:38:22.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I would just think they'd want to</v>

2118
01:38:22.201 --> 01:38:24.900
<v Speaker 1>hand that stuff out quick with so many</v>
<v Speaker 1>people getting it.</v>

2119
01:38:25.260 --> 01:38:28.560
<v Speaker 1>It's so common.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we looked at a map recently on</v>

2120
01:38:28.561 --> 01:38:33.120
<v Speaker 1>the podcast have lyme disease infections</v>
<v Speaker 1>across the east coast and the east coast</v>

2121
01:38:33.121 --> 01:38:36.000
<v Speaker 1>of United States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously that's where you live is just</v>

2122
01:38:36.330 --> 01:38:38.190
<v Speaker 1>a hotbed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

2123
01:38:38.191 --> 01:38:39.990
<v Speaker 1>It's everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2124
01:38:39.991 --> 01:38:42.690
<v Speaker 1>it isn't an.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got friends on Cape Cod where it's</v>

2125
01:38:42.691 --> 01:38:44.340
<v Speaker 1>really prevalent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really bad,</v>

2126
01:38:44.700 --> 01:38:47.730
<v Speaker 1>so bad that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they keep the antibiotic in their</v>

2127
01:38:47.731 --> 01:38:52.110
<v Speaker 1>kitchen drawer to Jesus and if you catch</v>
<v Speaker 1>it quick enough,</v>

2128
01:38:52.410 --> 01:38:54.180
<v Speaker 1>does it stop it in its tracks?</v>

2129
01:38:54.320 --> 01:38:56.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the real problem is when it gets into</v>

2130
01:38:56.341 --> 01:38:59.490
<v Speaker 1>your bloodstream and you don't treat it</v>
<v Speaker 1>long enough or quick enough.</v>

2131
01:38:59.730 --> 01:39:01.110
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so my,</v>

2132
01:39:01.140 --> 01:39:03.060
<v Speaker 1>my daughter needed a what's called a pic</v>
<v Speaker 1>line,</v>

2133
01:39:03.061 --> 01:39:05.310
<v Speaker 1>which has delivered the antibiotic to</v>
<v Speaker 1>straight into the heart.</v>

2134
01:39:05.470 --> 01:39:06.810
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they left it too long.</v>

2135
01:39:07.440 --> 01:39:09.180
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd want to kill them and she didn't</v>

2136
01:39:09.181 --> 01:39:11.910
<v Speaker 1>have a ring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a ring of inflammation.</v>

2137
01:39:11.940 --> 01:39:15.840
<v Speaker 1>But you knew I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was meningitis,</v>

2138
01:39:15.841 --> 01:39:18.540
<v Speaker 1>bacteria in the brain or something like</v>
<v Speaker 1>leukemia.</v>

2139
01:39:18.541 --> 01:39:22.530
<v Speaker 1>Was the other possibility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those dirty fucking bugs,</v>

2140
01:39:22.710 --> 01:39:26.520
<v Speaker 1>what can be done to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to somehow or another eradicate those</v>

2141
01:39:26.521 --> 01:39:28.170
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>

2142
01:39:28.171 --> 01:39:29.004
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2143
01:39:29.430 --> 01:39:31.560
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of my friends got a few friends</v>

2144
01:39:31.561 --> 01:39:32.590
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2145
01:39:32.640 --> 01:39:36.360
<v Speaker 1>she was working at Mit and she's</v>
<v Speaker 1>developed a way using the crispr system</v>

2146
01:39:36.840 --> 01:39:38.760
<v Speaker 1>to kill these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you say,</v>

2147
01:39:38.761 --> 01:39:40.130
<v Speaker 1>damn little fuckers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2148
01:39:40.260 --> 01:39:44.130
<v Speaker 1>and so there is possibly going to be the</v>
<v Speaker 1>first test of releasing a modified</v>

2149
01:39:44.131 --> 01:39:46.140
<v Speaker 1>organism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lyme organism,</v>

2150
01:39:46.141 --> 01:39:46.980
<v Speaker 1>to kill them off.</v>

2151
01:39:47.490 --> 01:39:50.030
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>MP,</v>

2152
01:39:50.100 --> 01:39:52.980
<v Speaker 1>you know that's going to cross some new</v>
<v Speaker 1>superbugs gonna kill everybody.</v>

2153
01:39:54.140 --> 01:39:56.310
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A Brad Pitt movie,</v>

2154
01:39:56.311 --> 01:39:57.930
<v Speaker 1>the Zombie One,</v>
<v Speaker 1>World War z</v>

2155
01:40:00.060 --> 01:40:01.980
<v Speaker 1>might be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but on the other hand,</v>

2156
01:40:02.550 --> 01:40:05.550
<v Speaker 1>we might all be saved from lung disease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would like that.</v>

2157
01:40:05.610 --> 01:40:07.150
<v Speaker 1>That would be great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just.</v>

2158
01:40:07.300 --> 01:40:10.290
<v Speaker 1>Where did lyme disease come from?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was some conspiracy theory</v>

2159
01:40:10.291 --> 01:40:12.110
<v Speaker 1>website.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was thinking that lyme disease was</v>

2160
01:40:12.111 --> 01:40:15.060
<v Speaker 1>some sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some sort of a biological weapon.</v>

2161
01:40:15.870 --> 01:40:17.700
<v Speaker 1>That's probably bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure.</v>

2162
01:40:18.210 --> 01:40:19.800
<v Speaker 1>But it came out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was in Lyme,</v>

2163
01:40:19.801 --> 01:40:20.640
<v Speaker 1>Connecticut,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2164
01:40:21.180 --> 01:40:22.750
<v Speaker 1>Wasn't that one of the first cases?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2165
01:40:23.130 --> 01:40:28.130
<v Speaker 1>so that's a close enough to Harvard just</v>
<v Speaker 1>stayed away.</v>

2166
01:40:29.190 --> 01:40:30.630
<v Speaker 1>I thought you said Russians were buying</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2167
01:40:30.870 --> 01:40:32.730
<v Speaker 1>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said conspiracy theory.</v>

2168
01:40:33.750 --> 01:40:36.180
<v Speaker 1>I didn't say it was Russian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as a biological weapon,</v>

2169
01:40:36.850 --> 01:40:41.070
<v Speaker 1>it's just an awful thing and that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now there's the.</v>

2170
01:40:41.280 --> 01:40:46.280
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you're aware of the lone star</v>
<v Speaker 1>tick that gives people that I'm a Alpha</v>

2171
01:40:46.950 --> 01:40:47.070
<v Speaker 1>Gal.</v>

2172
01:40:47.070 --> 01:40:50.010
<v Speaker 1>D disease,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one that makes you allergic to red</v>

2173
01:40:50.011 --> 01:40:52.910
<v Speaker 1>meat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is where.</v>

2174
01:40:53.020 --> 01:40:56.020
<v Speaker 1>Where was that before?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy to see these things morphing</v>

2175
01:40:56.021 --> 01:40:58.120
<v Speaker 1>and morphing and there are a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>bugs,</v>

2176
01:40:58.121 --> 01:41:01.060
<v Speaker 1>we don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody just published a few days ago</v>

2177
01:41:01.270 --> 01:41:04.150
<v Speaker 1>that they took surveys of the microbiome</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the skin,</v>

2178
01:41:04.300 --> 01:41:07.780
<v Speaker 1>mouth got across the planet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different races,</v>

2179
01:41:07.781 --> 01:41:10.060
<v Speaker 1>different foods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>geographic geography,</v>

2180
01:41:10.960 --> 01:41:13.870
<v Speaker 1>and they have 100,000 different</v>
<v Speaker 1>organisms living on humanity</v>

2181
01:41:15.760 --> 01:41:18.130
<v Speaker 1>and most of them are unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

2182
01:41:18.131 --> 01:41:18.910
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2183
01:41:18.910 --> 01:41:23.170
<v Speaker 1>And all they have to do is just more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little bit one way or the other way</v>

2184
01:41:23.260 --> 01:41:26.050
<v Speaker 1>and all of a sudden people were dropping</v>
<v Speaker 1>like flies.</v>

2185
01:41:26.560 --> 01:41:28.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what's interesting is on the skin</v>

2186
01:41:28.321 --> 01:41:32.380
<v Speaker 1>and in the gut of people in India is</v>
<v Speaker 1>very different than what we have and the</v>

2187
01:41:32.381 --> 01:41:35.580
<v Speaker 1>different smells you might.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They probably think we smell bad,</v>

2188
01:41:36.820 --> 01:41:38.680
<v Speaker 1>but I know this because.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well they're wrong.</v>

2189
01:41:39.130 --> 01:41:39.791
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2190
01:41:39.791 --> 01:41:44.150
<v Speaker 1>Because I smelled like old spice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>

2191
01:41:44.200 --> 01:41:47.560
<v Speaker 1>these wounds there actually if you want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to kill the bacteria in a wound,</v>

2192
01:41:47.561 --> 01:41:50.980
<v Speaker 1>they're different in the wounds of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people in India than they are over here.</v>

2193
01:41:50.981 --> 01:41:51.581
<v Speaker 1>And.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>

2194
01:41:51.581 --> 01:41:55.300
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And obviously they have different diets</v>

2195
01:41:55.301 --> 01:41:57.510
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's probably different things</v>

2196
01:41:57.530 --> 01:42:00.850
<v Speaker 1>they're used to consuming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so their gut bacteria is different,</v>

2197
01:42:01.420 --> 01:42:02.460
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything's different.</v>

2198
01:42:02.480 --> 01:42:06.160
<v Speaker 1>The genomes are different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we need to map the globe to first</v>

2199
01:42:06.161 --> 01:42:08.410
<v Speaker 1>know what we're dealing with before we</v>
<v Speaker 1>can address.</v>

2200
01:42:08.630 --> 01:42:11.200
<v Speaker 1>It just seems like a never ending</v>
<v Speaker 1>struggle.</v>

2201
01:42:12.470 --> 01:42:15.730
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it everyday is a struggle against the</v>

2202
01:42:15.731 --> 01:42:17.410
<v Speaker 1>natural world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want to kill us.</v>

2203
01:42:17.411 --> 01:42:18.730
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2204
01:42:19.120 --> 01:42:21.220
<v Speaker 1>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the little things and the big things,</v>

2205
01:42:21.310 --> 01:42:26.310
<v Speaker 1>all of it with food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how much of your time gets consumed</v>

2206
01:42:26.501 --> 01:42:28.730
<v Speaker 1>with this kind of work?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

2207
01:42:28.870 --> 01:42:30.790
<v Speaker 1>well it's all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything is all consuming.</v>

2208
01:42:30.791 --> 01:42:34.620
<v Speaker 1>My,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my typical day is I got to go to a</v>

2209
01:42:34.810 --> 01:42:37.840
<v Speaker 1>company meeting going to the US</v>
<v Speaker 1>government.</v>

2210
01:42:37.940 --> 01:42:40.120
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting called by senator for an</v>
<v Speaker 1>update.</v>

2211
01:42:40.810 --> 01:42:43.990
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so probably A.</v>

2212
01:42:43.990 --> 01:42:45.310
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me be formal about this.</v>

2213
01:42:45.580 --> 01:42:49.720
<v Speaker 1>Harvard University allows me to spend 20</v>
<v Speaker 1>percent of my time outside of the</v>

2214
01:42:49.721 --> 01:42:51.790
<v Speaker 1>university.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's 19 point nine.</v>

2215
01:42:54.430 --> 01:42:56.080
<v Speaker 1>So you have to cover your ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that?</v>

2216
01:42:56.081 --> 01:43:01.081
<v Speaker 1>We just did maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he tracks their time now anymore.</v>

2217
01:43:01.150 --> 01:43:05.160
<v Speaker 1>But I would think that with a guy like</v>
<v Speaker 1>you who's so you're,</v>

2218
01:43:05.230 --> 01:43:07.300
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you concentrate so much.</v>

2219
01:43:07.600 --> 01:43:12.400
<v Speaker 1>You're so focused on anti anti,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anti aging that having a gigantic</v>

2220
01:43:12.401 --> 01:43:17.401
<v Speaker 1>workload would seem to me to be a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be an issue in terms of</v>

2221
01:43:18.220 --> 01:43:20.590
<v Speaker 1>overtaxing your system stressing</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself out.</v>

2222
01:43:21.430 --> 01:43:24.070
<v Speaker 1>So nobody's ever asked me that and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>a really good question.</v>

2223
01:43:24.620 --> 01:43:26.430
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm,</v>

2224
01:43:26.431 --> 01:43:28.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm not really worried about dying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually,</v>

2225
01:43:28.811 --> 01:43:32.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm not worried at all at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know is,</v>

2226
01:43:32.470 --> 01:43:33.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a wolf in the room.</v>

2227
01:43:34.060 --> 01:43:35.680
<v Speaker 1>He's staring at you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2228
01:43:35.780 --> 01:43:38.170
<v Speaker 1>that'd be a grizzly death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd probably not want that,</v>

2229
01:43:38.590 --> 01:43:41.680
<v Speaker 1>but I've been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought I was going to die and on</v>

2230
01:43:42.250 --> 01:43:45.730
<v Speaker 1>airplanes before and I'm pretty calm</v>
<v Speaker 1>about that.</v>

2231
01:43:45.730 --> 01:43:49.510
<v Speaker 1>So I guess that's a good test.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I do want to leave a legacy.</v>

2232
01:43:49.511 --> 01:43:52.640
<v Speaker 1>I want to be able to say the world's</v>
<v Speaker 1>better for me being on the planet.</v>

2233
01:43:52.940 --> 01:43:55.040
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so that's why I do all this stuff.</v>

2234
01:43:55.050 --> 01:43:57.080
<v Speaker 1>I tried to protect the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the humanity.</v>

2235
01:43:57.081 --> 01:44:00.530
<v Speaker 1>I try to protect nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to help with food production.</v>

2236
01:44:00.870 --> 01:44:03.260
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my aging stuff is what I'm known for,</v>

2237
01:44:03.830 --> 01:44:06.890
<v Speaker 1>but I do a lot of this other stuff that</v>
<v Speaker 1>people don't know that.</v>

2238
01:44:07.400 --> 01:44:12.400
<v Speaker 1>So you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your concern is anti aging,</v>

2239
01:44:12.920 --> 01:44:15.410
<v Speaker 1>you certainly want people to live</v>
<v Speaker 1>longer,</v>

2240
01:44:15.740 --> 01:44:20.300
<v Speaker 1>but you yourself are more concerned with</v>
<v Speaker 1>your work than you are with your own</v>

2241
01:44:20.420 --> 01:44:22.490
<v Speaker 1>personal life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2242
01:44:22.820 --> 01:44:25.640
<v Speaker 1>100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My wife will tell you that the reason</v>

2243
01:44:25.641 --> 01:44:30.200
<v Speaker 1>that I look after myself as best I can</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I've got the energy is it would be</v>

2244
01:44:30.201 --> 01:44:32.270
<v Speaker 1>a bad look if I died from heart disease</v>
<v Speaker 1>tomorrow.</v>

2245
01:44:32.420 --> 01:44:34.670
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The anti aging guy.</v>

2246
01:44:35.020 --> 01:44:37.700
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you died from anything other than an</v>

2247
01:44:37.701 --> 01:44:38.960
<v Speaker 1>accident,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2248
01:44:39.360 --> 01:44:39.921
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

2249
01:44:39.921 --> 01:44:41.690
<v Speaker 1>So I'm trying to be a role model for</v>
<v Speaker 1>others.</v>

2250
01:44:42.090 --> 01:44:42.960
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

2251
01:44:43.300 --> 01:44:44.480
<v Speaker 1>if I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I died tomorrow,</v>

2252
01:44:44.600 --> 01:44:47.570
<v Speaker 1>that'd be fine with me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to finish my work at least,</v>

2253
01:44:48.140 --> 01:44:49.760
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would like to leave something behind.</v>

2254
01:44:49.761 --> 01:44:54.761
<v Speaker 1>But what I don't want to do is to be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>burden on my kids and my grandkids.</v>

2255
01:44:55.430 --> 01:44:57.200
<v Speaker 1>And so that's what I'm also trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>prevent.</v>

2256
01:44:57.890 --> 01:45:00.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would seem to me to be the real</v>

2257
01:45:00.620 --> 01:45:05.420
<v Speaker 1>final frontier of anti aging is folks</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are really,</v>

2258
01:45:05.421 --> 01:45:10.310
<v Speaker 1>really old because it seems like they</v>
<v Speaker 1>would be open to try almost anything.</v>

2259
01:45:10.790 --> 01:45:15.530
<v Speaker 1>And if you could bring them back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be uber bizarre.</v>

2260
01:45:17.420 --> 01:45:19.360
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How far away do you think we are from</v>

2261
01:45:19.370 --> 01:45:20.590
<v Speaker 1>doing something like that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2262
01:45:20.591 --> 01:45:23.300
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it often comes as a shock to people who</v>

2263
01:45:23.301 --> 01:45:27.170
<v Speaker 1>don't work on this that we're already</v>
<v Speaker 1>testing these molecules in clinical</v>

2264
01:45:27.171 --> 01:45:31.850
<v Speaker 1>trials on elderly people have been doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>that for a number of years now with some</v>

2265
01:45:31.851 --> 01:45:32.684
<v Speaker 1>positive results.</v>

2266
01:45:33.110 --> 01:45:36.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm over at Harvard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were giving any men and,</v>

2267
01:45:36.400 --> 01:45:39.660
<v Speaker 1>and another molecule called mit be 66.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2268
01:45:40.080 --> 01:45:43.910
<v Speaker 1>what's the other one called?</v>
<v Speaker 1>My laundry so that the company's called</v>

2269
01:45:43.911 --> 01:45:48.911
<v Speaker 1>Metro Biotech and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes Super Nad boosters and the drug</v>

2270
01:45:49.251 --> 01:45:52.060
<v Speaker 1>is called developmental drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>MIB,</v>

2271
01:45:52.190 --> 01:45:53.510
<v Speaker 1>dash six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two six,</v>

2272
01:45:54.590 --> 01:45:55.550
<v Speaker 1>six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two six.</v>

2273
01:45:55.570 --> 01:45:57.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we're hoping that it will not just</v>

2274
01:45:57.561 --> 01:45:59.660
<v Speaker 1>have to get that alleyway somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

2275
01:46:00.700 --> 01:46:02.900
<v Speaker 1>I got to go to some shady doctor with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>weird accent.</v>

2276
01:46:04.280 --> 01:46:06.920
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that one,</v>

2277
01:46:07.070 --> 01:46:09.110
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that one we hope to get on the market in</v>

2278
01:46:09.111 --> 01:46:11.660
<v Speaker 1>about three years from now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

2279
01:46:12.050 --> 01:46:12.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

2280
01:46:12.530 --> 01:46:16.310
<v Speaker 1>for diseases FDA approved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they're using it right now on old</v>

2281
01:46:16.311 --> 01:46:19.490
<v Speaker 1>folks are testing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tests for safety,</v>

2282
01:46:20.330 --> 01:46:21.950
<v Speaker 1>but we're also going to be testing</v>
<v Speaker 1>later,</v>

2283
01:46:22.360 --> 01:46:23.300
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>energy.</v>

2284
01:46:23.480 --> 01:46:25.490
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can measure actually the Nad levels,</v>

2285
01:46:25.491 --> 01:46:28.970
<v Speaker 1>that molecule I mentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can measure that in their muscles and</v>

2286
01:46:28.971 --> 01:46:30.170
<v Speaker 1>we'll test if that worked.</v>

2287
01:46:30.640 --> 01:46:31.473
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we'll,</v>

2288
01:46:31.550 --> 01:46:35.000
<v Speaker 1>we'll measure of course their endurance</v>
<v Speaker 1>because at the mice that we traded with</v>

2289
01:46:35.020 --> 01:46:37.910
<v Speaker 1>Nmn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just ran and ran and ran.</v>

2290
01:46:37.911 --> 01:46:40.820
<v Speaker 1>They actually broke the little treadmill</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my lap because they ran so far.</v>

2291
01:46:41.120 --> 01:46:43.910
<v Speaker 1>And you're giving it to them orally or</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're injecting into them?</v>

2292
01:46:44.200 --> 01:46:44.680
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's uh,</v>

2293
01:46:44.680 --> 01:46:47.470
<v Speaker 1>it's a little tablet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just put food,</v>

2294
01:46:47.920 --> 01:46:49.350
<v Speaker 1>put it in their fruit or something like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2295
01:46:49.450 --> 01:46:50.340
<v Speaker 1>All the mice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2296
01:46:50.430 --> 01:46:52.680
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought you're talking about humans in</v>

2297
01:46:52.681 --> 01:46:54.090
<v Speaker 1>the mice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We put in their drinking water,</v>

2298
01:46:54.880 --> 01:46:57.150
<v Speaker 1>drink it fairly easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2299
01:46:57.520 --> 01:47:00.090
<v Speaker 1>And they have no idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no idea.</v>

2300
01:47:00.420 --> 01:47:02.250
<v Speaker 1>And in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people who are running the treadmill</v>

2301
01:47:02.251 --> 01:47:05.700
<v Speaker 1>have no idea which is which.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we had mice running three kilometers</v>

2302
01:47:05.701 --> 01:47:09.480
<v Speaker 1>and then the machine stopped and I get a</v>
<v Speaker 1>text from the researcher,</v>

2303
01:47:09.481 --> 01:47:10.590
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the machine broke.</v>

2304
01:47:11.040 --> 01:47:13.290
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>check the software and turns out</v>

2305
01:47:13.291 --> 01:47:16.500
<v Speaker 1>software was written to stop at three</v>
<v Speaker 1>kilometers because no mouse had run that</v>

2306
01:47:16.501 --> 01:47:17.334
<v Speaker 1>far before.</v>

2307
01:47:18.020 --> 01:47:19.770
<v Speaker 1>That's long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those are all nice.</v>

2308
01:47:19.830 --> 01:47:21.930
<v Speaker 1>Don't forget,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are mice that are the equivalent</v>

2309
01:47:21.931 --> 01:47:24.360
<v Speaker 1>of a 65 year old human.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

2310
01:47:24.520 --> 01:47:26.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we figured out why they run further.</v>

2311
01:47:26.910 --> 01:47:31.170
<v Speaker 1>This isn't just try it and see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We figured out that,</v>

2312
01:47:31.250 --> 01:47:34.350
<v Speaker 1>that the lining of the blood vessels</v>
<v Speaker 1>needs an id as you get older,</v>

2313
01:47:34.710 --> 01:47:36.870
<v Speaker 1>but they needed all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But as you get older you don't have</v>

2314
01:47:36.871 --> 01:47:40.500
<v Speaker 1>enough net.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the Nmn replenishes that and allows</v>

2315
01:47:40.501 --> 01:47:45.501
<v Speaker 1>the blood vessel lining to respond to</v>
<v Speaker 1>exercise and even grow blood vessels if</v>

2316
01:47:46.021 --> 01:47:48.240
<v Speaker 1>you don't exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so those mice,</v>

2317
01:47:48.750 --> 01:47:51.150
<v Speaker 1>they ran and ran and ran,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that didn't get lactate build up as</v>

2318
01:47:51.151 --> 01:47:53.010
<v Speaker 1>much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just didn't feel tired.</v>

2319
01:47:53.140 --> 01:47:55.200
<v Speaker 1>So lactic acid buildup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2320
01:47:55.620 --> 01:47:58.650
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So muscle fatigue would be different.</v>

2321
01:48:00.540 --> 01:48:01.760
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well they didn't seem to get that</v>

2322
01:48:01.761 --> 01:48:02.720
<v Speaker 1>either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2323
01:48:02.810 --> 01:48:07.810
<v Speaker 1>Was just better blood flow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We even pinched off an artery and the</v>

2324
01:48:09.050 --> 01:48:12.140
<v Speaker 1>body responded much better to restore</v>
<v Speaker 1>restoring blood flow,</v>

2325
01:48:12.141 --> 01:48:14.750
<v Speaker 1>which would be great for patients who</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a heart attack.</v>

2326
01:48:15.590 --> 01:48:18.020
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now with human beings,</v>

2327
01:48:18.021 --> 01:48:21.080
<v Speaker 1>what has been the most dramatic result?</v>

2328
01:48:23.630 --> 01:48:26.210
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a hard question because a lot of</v>

2329
01:48:26.211 --> 01:48:28.100
<v Speaker 1>it's early stage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2330
01:48:29.390 --> 01:48:34.390
<v Speaker 1>we developed a molecule that seemed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>effectively treat a disease called</v>

2331
01:48:35.481 --> 01:48:37.640
<v Speaker 1>psoriasis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the information.</v>

2332
01:48:37.690 --> 01:48:38.980
<v Speaker 1>Has that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2333
01:48:38.981 --> 01:48:39.740
<v Speaker 1>So that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

2334
01:48:39.740 --> 01:48:41.810
<v Speaker 1>that worked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's a molecule,</v>

2335
01:48:41.820 --> 01:48:43.730
<v Speaker 1>that's something you apply to the skin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a,</v>

2336
01:48:43.731 --> 01:48:45.900
<v Speaker 1>it was a pill actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2337
01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:48.470
<v Speaker 1>How does that work?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does it doing?</v>

2338
01:48:48.610 --> 01:48:50.930
<v Speaker 1>A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's an activator of one of these</v>

2339
01:48:51.040 --> 01:48:53.540
<v Speaker 1>sirtuins that we found in yeast</v>
<v Speaker 1>originally.</v>

2340
01:48:53.780 --> 01:48:58.210
<v Speaker 1>These are two and protective enzymes in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the body and there antiinflammatory.</v>

2341
01:48:58.250 --> 01:49:00.320
<v Speaker 1>And so that worked well against that</v>
<v Speaker 1>disease.</v>

2342
01:49:01.010 --> 01:49:03.440
<v Speaker 1>So psoriasis has something to do with</v>
<v Speaker 1>inflammation.</v>

2343
01:49:04.160 --> 01:49:05.770
<v Speaker 1>It is an inflammatory disorder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

2344
01:49:06.800 --> 01:49:09.920
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are all autoimmune disorders Antifa or</v>

2345
01:49:10.160 --> 01:49:12.620
<v Speaker 1>inflammatory based disorders?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe so.</v>

2346
01:49:12.830 --> 01:49:14.150
<v Speaker 1>Really interesting.</v>

2347
01:49:15.420 --> 01:49:16.253
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

2348
01:49:17.050 --> 01:49:18.670
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a little ego.</v>

2349
01:49:18.750 --> 01:49:22.180
<v Speaker 1>You don't see the little spots on my</v>
<v Speaker 1>skin where I don't have any pigment.</v>

2350
01:49:22.450 --> 01:49:24.070
<v Speaker 1>It's genetic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My grandmother had it,</v>

2351
01:49:24.100 --> 01:49:26.240
<v Speaker 1>my grandmother sister had it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2352
01:49:26.260 --> 01:49:29.510
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if that would help me</v>
<v Speaker 1>a.</v>

2353
01:49:29.860 --> 01:49:31.360
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really couldn't say.</v>

2354
01:49:31.450 --> 01:49:33.340
<v Speaker 1>What's it called again?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which one?</v>

2355
01:49:33.370 --> 01:49:35.400
<v Speaker 1>Third drug that was tested.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2356
01:49:35.440 --> 01:49:37.840
<v Speaker 1>it has an srt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twenty one.</v>

2357
01:49:37.841 --> 01:49:41.140
<v Speaker 1>Oh four.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is the stuff that worked on</v>

2358
01:49:41.141 --> 01:49:46.141
<v Speaker 1>psoriasis in a small study in New York.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now what other,</v>

2359
01:49:47.951 --> 01:49:51.460
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what other things had really a dramatic</v>

2360
01:49:51.461 --> 01:49:52.930
<v Speaker 1>results on humans?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2361
01:49:52.931 --> 01:49:55.120
<v Speaker 1>we're not there yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't have traumatic results.</v>

2362
01:49:55.150 --> 01:49:59.800
<v Speaker 1>Is there anything promising results on</v>
<v Speaker 1>humans or than Nmn and yes,</v>

2363
01:49:59.801 --> 01:50:01.350
<v Speaker 1>there are there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this mtor,</v>

2364
01:50:01.360 --> 01:50:03.970
<v Speaker 1>I mentioned earlier where the drug</v>
<v Speaker 1>rapamycin,</v>

2365
01:50:04.040 --> 01:50:06.130
<v Speaker 1>which is too dangerous to try on normal</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

2366
01:50:07.660 --> 01:50:11.590
<v Speaker 1>That drug has been tried on elderly</v>
<v Speaker 1>people and it boosted their immune</v>

2367
01:50:11.591 --> 01:50:16.030
<v Speaker 1>system in the same way that you see with</v>
<v Speaker 1>calorie restricted mice and so that that</v>

2368
01:50:16.031 --> 01:50:18.040
<v Speaker 1>was an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an early signal that you might be able</v>

2369
01:50:18.041 --> 01:50:20.380
<v Speaker 1>to reverse aspects of aging and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>elderly with that truck.</v>

2370
01:50:21.010 --> 01:50:22.870
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with older folks,</v>

2371
01:50:22.871 --> 01:50:27.580
<v Speaker 1>one thing you see is the body doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>produce Collagen as much.</v>

2372
01:50:27.581 --> 01:50:32.581
<v Speaker 1>Your skin gets lax and starts to sag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

2373
01:50:33.550 --> 01:50:38.550
<v Speaker 1>what things could be done to mitigate</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I'm eating besides botox and stuff.</v>

2374
01:50:39.400 --> 01:50:40.570
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Botox doesn't really do.</v>

2375
01:50:40.571 --> 01:50:43.660
<v Speaker 1>That just freezes your face like aware</v>
<v Speaker 1>as well.</v>

2376
01:50:43.750 --> 01:50:45.040
<v Speaker 1>So I'm asked that a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Will it?</v>

2377
01:50:45.650 --> 01:50:48.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm David,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't worry about protecting cancer,</v>

2378
01:50:48.071 --> 01:50:49.230
<v Speaker 1>heart disease,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alzheimer's.</v>

2379
01:50:49.231 --> 01:50:50.800
<v Speaker 1>So I look better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can I look better?</v>

2380
01:50:50.801 --> 01:50:51.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2381
01:50:52.060 --> 01:50:52.720
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>

2382
01:50:52.720 --> 01:50:55.900
<v Speaker 1>the answer is that a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't know,</v>

2383
01:50:56.190 --> 01:50:57.430
<v Speaker 1>a B,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're working on it.</v>

2384
01:50:57.490 --> 01:51:00.400
<v Speaker 1>We have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we work with a cosmetic company that so</v>

2385
01:51:00.401 --> 01:51:01.940
<v Speaker 1>far so good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2386
01:51:02.500 --> 01:51:04.570
<v Speaker 1>but I don't endorse products.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not me.</v>

2387
01:51:05.110 --> 01:51:07.210
<v Speaker 1>But also what's interesting is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>these mice,</v>

2388
01:51:07.211 --> 01:51:09.250
<v Speaker 1>at least they stay younger looking as</v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

2389
01:51:09.760 --> 01:51:12.100
<v Speaker 1>They don't just live longer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2390
01:51:12.210 --> 01:51:15.280
<v Speaker 1>so this hope that something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the skin is a big organ.</v>

2391
01:51:15.600 --> 01:51:16.200
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2392
01:51:16.200 --> 01:51:18.640
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why wouldn't it stay young just like the</v>

2393
01:51:18.641 --> 01:51:20.950
<v Speaker 1>rest of the body?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2394
01:51:20.951 --> 01:51:23.410
<v Speaker 1>it certainly indicative of whether or</v>
<v Speaker 1>not a person's healthy,</v>

2395
01:51:23.411 --> 01:51:25.180
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you see someone in their skin is</v>

2396
01:51:25.181 --> 01:51:29.200
<v Speaker 1>really saggy and fucked up looking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you assume that persons not healthy.</v>

2397
01:51:30.310 --> 01:51:31.390
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2398
01:51:31.420 --> 01:51:35.320
<v Speaker 1>and actually a lot of us scientists</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe that how you look is actually</v>

2399
01:51:35.321 --> 01:51:37.600
<v Speaker 1>pretty good indicator of your biological</v>
<v Speaker 1>age.</v>

2400
01:51:38.080 --> 01:51:39.190
<v Speaker 1>Speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>biological age,</v>

2401
01:51:39.191 --> 01:51:42.130
<v Speaker 1>there's a been a breakthrough the last</v>
<v Speaker 1>few years being able to tell your</v>

2402
01:51:42.131 --> 01:51:45.840
<v Speaker 1>biological age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm one part's done by inside tracker</v>

2403
01:51:45.850 --> 01:51:49.300
<v Speaker 1>looking at blood biomarkers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a new one called the DNA</v>

2404
01:51:49.450 --> 01:51:50.980
<v Speaker 1>cluck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You heard about this?</v>

2405
01:51:51.010 --> 01:51:52.600
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a.</v>

2406
01:51:52.601 --> 01:51:55.200
<v Speaker 1>So a colleague of mine is well known for</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

2407
01:51:55.210 --> 01:51:58.280
<v Speaker 1>Steve Horvath,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what it is is uh,</v>

2408
01:51:58.450 --> 01:52:03.280
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how DNA I said is changing over time and</v>

2409
01:52:03.281 --> 01:52:05.920
<v Speaker 1>the epigenome is changing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So these are like scratches on the</v>

2410
01:52:05.921 --> 01:52:07.000
<v Speaker 1>clock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2411
01:52:07.030 --> 01:52:07.900
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the DVD.</v>

2412
01:52:07.930 --> 01:52:12.430
<v Speaker 1>We think we know what those scratches</v>
<v Speaker 1>are and how to remove them and what they</v>

2413
01:52:12.431 --> 01:52:15.400
<v Speaker 1>are a little chemicals that bind to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>DNA called methyls.</v>

2414
01:52:15.970 --> 01:52:20.710
<v Speaker 1>And the older you get the momentum you</v>
<v Speaker 1>accumulate on your DNA and we can read</v>

2415
01:52:20.711 --> 01:52:25.711
<v Speaker 1>that with machine and we can very</v>
<v Speaker 1>precisely say you're roughly this age,</v>

2416
01:52:26.830 --> 01:52:30.970
<v Speaker 1>but you're actually older or younger for</v>
<v Speaker 1>your chronological age</v>

2417
01:52:32.560 --> 01:52:36.610
<v Speaker 1>and now we think we can reverse that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2418
01:52:37.060 --> 01:52:39.370
<v Speaker 1>How long do you think you are away from</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing that?</v>

2419
01:52:39.770 --> 01:52:41.110
<v Speaker 1>Being able to reverse that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2420
01:52:41.111 --> 01:52:43.660
<v Speaker 1>that's that glaucoma treatment that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're looking at.</v>

2421
01:52:43.870 --> 01:52:48.870
<v Speaker 1>I would like to see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take someone like a wealthy Mel Gibson</v>

2422
01:52:49.701 --> 01:52:52.490
<v Speaker 1>type character and just shoot them up</v>
<v Speaker 1>with everything,</v>

2423
01:52:53.180 --> 01:52:58.180
<v Speaker 1>like just get someone who's willing to</v>
<v Speaker 1>give you a full run of them and run it</v>

2424
01:52:58.871 --> 01:53:00.860
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some sort of a science fiction movie.</v>

2425
01:53:00.861 --> 01:53:03.860
<v Speaker 1>Tell you what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll do it if you'll employ me because</v>

2426
01:53:03.861 --> 01:53:04.880
<v Speaker 1>I'll be kicked out of my job.</v>

2427
01:53:06.830 --> 01:53:08.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But man,</v>

2428
01:53:08.810 --> 01:53:11.540
<v Speaker 1>I mean it just seems like there's so</v>
<v Speaker 1>many promising things.</v>

2429
01:53:11.541 --> 01:53:14.990
<v Speaker 1>It would be really fascinating if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>could document that you could take one</v>

2430
01:53:14.991 --> 01:53:16.610
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like a,</v>

2431
01:53:16.611 --> 01:53:19.880
<v Speaker 1>a wealthy man in his mid to late</v>
<v Speaker 1>sixties.</v>

2432
01:53:20.600 --> 01:53:24.020
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this forage element in anti</v>

2433
01:53:24.021 --> 01:53:24.531
<v Speaker 1>aging.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

2434
01:53:24.531 --> 01:53:28.130
<v Speaker 1>I don't even like the term anti aging.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's what do you like a longevity</v>

2435
01:53:28.131 --> 01:53:29.140
<v Speaker 1>research?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2436
01:53:29.770 --> 01:53:32.840
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're about to announce maybe this a</v>

2437
01:53:32.841 --> 01:53:37.841
<v Speaker 1>sneak preview for everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an academy for Aging Research of the top</v>

2438
01:53:38.480 --> 01:53:40.820
<v Speaker 1>20 scientists in the world of banding</v>
<v Speaker 1>together to,</v>

2439
01:53:41.510 --> 01:53:42.343
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2440
01:53:42.470 --> 01:53:45.300
<v Speaker 1>produce white papers and opinions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2441
01:53:45.980 --> 01:53:49.520
<v Speaker 1>but yet we call it longevity research.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so anti aging is,</v>

2442
01:53:49.850 --> 01:53:52.640
<v Speaker 1>is more that the botox and that kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>

2443
01:53:52.641 --> 01:53:54.350
<v Speaker 1>that we don't want anything to do it</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2444
01:53:54.380 --> 01:53:56.870
<v Speaker 1>But that's nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not really anti aging.</v>

2445
01:53:56.990 --> 01:53:59.750
<v Speaker 1>You're not doing anything about age and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just freezing your skin's.</v>

2446
01:53:59.750 --> 01:54:01.520
<v Speaker 1>What doesn't move?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is.</v>

2447
01:54:01.550 --> 01:54:05.030
<v Speaker 1>That to me is one of the weirder things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially with men.</v>

2448
01:54:05.390 --> 01:54:07.130
<v Speaker 1>When I see a man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his forehead doesn't move.</v>

2449
01:54:07.131 --> 01:54:08.870
<v Speaker 1>I want to smack him in the mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2450
01:54:08.871 --> 01:54:13.130
<v Speaker 1>what's wrong with you sir?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How dare you smack it just,</v>

2451
01:54:13.640 --> 01:54:14.500
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

2452
01:54:14.930 --> 01:54:18.920
<v Speaker 1>it's not like botox or fillers or any of</v>
<v Speaker 1>those things.</v>

2453
01:54:19.160 --> 01:54:24.160
<v Speaker 1>You're not doing anything for your</v>
<v Speaker 1>health or your actual real vitality.</v>

2454
01:54:24.560 --> 01:54:27.260
<v Speaker 1>You're just weirdly doing something</v>
<v Speaker 1>cosmetic,</v>

2455
01:54:28.180 --> 01:54:28.821
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

2456
01:54:28.821 --> 01:54:32.900
<v Speaker 1>you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I think the defense is you feel</v>

2457
01:54:32.901 --> 01:54:35.930
<v Speaker 1>better if you look better</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologically it might help.</v>

2458
01:54:36.080 --> 01:54:38.210
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they look better though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just look different.</v>

2459
01:54:38.780 --> 01:54:40.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's the problem.</v>

2460
01:54:40.220 --> 01:54:41.870
<v Speaker 1>It is true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2461
01:54:42.260 --> 01:54:42.641
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2462
01:54:42.641 --> 01:54:47.240
<v Speaker 1>I don't spend a lot of time thinking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the cosmetic industry for obvious</v>

2463
01:54:47.241 --> 01:54:49.200
<v Speaker 1>reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to save humanity and,</v>

2464
01:54:49.470 --> 01:54:51.920
<v Speaker 1>and improve the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2465
01:54:51.980 --> 01:54:53.420
<v Speaker 1>I actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do think we will,</v>

2466
01:54:53.460 --> 01:54:55.270
<v Speaker 1>we will be judged as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2467
01:54:55.340 --> 01:54:57.530
<v Speaker 1>as a species if an alien came down and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they said,</v>

2468
01:54:58.100 --> 01:55:00.050
<v Speaker 1>you're shooting botulism in your face</v>
<v Speaker 1>fries.</v>

2469
01:55:00.110 --> 01:55:01.220
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

2470
01:55:01.221 --> 01:55:03.530
<v Speaker 1>You are a weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not allowed in the club have</v>

2471
01:55:03.531 --> 01:55:06.980
<v Speaker 1>advanced species.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that would only be one thing that</v>

2472
01:55:06.981 --> 01:55:09.610
<v Speaker 1>we were weird from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what would,</v>

2473
01:55:09.640 --> 01:55:10.650
<v Speaker 1>what would they ask you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

2474
01:55:10.730 --> 01:55:11.720
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd ask us,</v>

2475
01:55:11.810 --> 01:55:14.840
<v Speaker 1>have you figured out the speed of light?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had asked me why I have drawings</v>

2476
01:55:14.841 --> 01:55:17.060
<v Speaker 1>all over my arm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2477
01:55:17.680 --> 01:55:20.000
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They might appreciate art maybe,</v>

2478
01:55:20.450 --> 01:55:23.070
<v Speaker 1>but like they'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why didn't you just get it and then just</v>

2479
01:55:23.110 --> 01:55:26.380
<v Speaker 1>wash it off or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to get it drilled in your skin</v>

2480
01:55:26.850 --> 01:55:29.630
<v Speaker 1>that's coming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think one of the most important</v>

2481
01:55:29.631 --> 01:55:34.631
<v Speaker 1>questions they'd ask to tell if we are</v>
<v Speaker 1>an advanced nation or pants species is,</v>

2482
01:55:34.911 --> 01:55:37.900
<v Speaker 1>have you figured out aging yet?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2483
01:55:38.080 --> 01:55:41.360
<v Speaker 1>Deterioration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we're so pathetic as a species.</v>

2484
01:55:41.420 --> 01:55:43.830
<v Speaker 1>Our answer would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you mean that's a thing.</v>

2485
01:55:44.100 --> 01:55:48.300
<v Speaker 2>You can do something about that and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll come back in a thousand years.</v>

2486
01:55:48.480 --> 01:55:49.770
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's got.</v>

2487
01:55:50.040 --> 01:55:52.830
<v Speaker 2>How many people do you think worldwide</v>
<v Speaker 2>are working in your field?</v>

2488
01:55:54.860 --> 01:55:56.420
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so in terms of leading labs,</v>

2489
01:55:56.421 --> 01:55:58.820
<v Speaker 2>there's about 20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>30,</v>

2490
01:55:59.570 --> 01:56:01.820
<v Speaker 2>broadly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a probably a few hundred labs</v>

2491
01:56:02.030 --> 01:56:05.180
<v Speaker 2>and other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all essentially the same field of study.</v>

2492
01:56:05.240 --> 01:56:09.230
<v Speaker 2>They're all working with the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>molecules and the same parameters.</v>

2493
01:56:09.320 --> 01:56:12.260
<v Speaker 2>I know that not everyone works with</v>
<v Speaker 2>molecules,</v>

2494
01:56:12.261 --> 01:56:14.840
<v Speaker 2>but what I can tell you is we get</v>
<v Speaker 2>together in conferences and we talk</v>

2495
01:56:14.841 --> 01:56:18.710
<v Speaker 2>about discovering new chain that extends</v>
<v Speaker 2>lifespan and a new molecule that's</v>

2496
01:56:18.711 --> 01:56:23.270
<v Speaker 2>working in mice or sometimes in humans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a big field now.</v>

2497
01:56:23.300 --> 01:56:25.500
<v Speaker 2>It's grown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when I started it was the backwater</v>

2498
01:56:25.520 --> 01:56:30.320
<v Speaker 2>of biology and oxidants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>etc. I was very lucky to start when it</v>

2499
01:56:30.321 --> 01:56:35.321
<v Speaker 2>was really small and stick it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those faIr amount of criticism in those</v>

2500
01:56:35.330 --> 01:56:36.290
<v Speaker 2>days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

2501
01:56:36.291 --> 01:56:37.390
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so like that.</v>

2502
01:56:37.400 --> 01:56:41.090
<v Speaker 2>It was like a lot of my friends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my supervisor said I was insane for</v>

2503
01:56:41.091 --> 01:56:42.560
<v Speaker 2>working on aging.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not a thing.</v>

2504
01:56:42.561 --> 01:56:44.600
<v Speaker 2>That's not biology really.</v>

2505
01:56:44.690 --> 01:56:45.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2506
01:56:45.721 --> 01:56:46.940
<v Speaker 2>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how long ago was this?</v>

2507
01:56:47.180 --> 01:56:50.020
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I came to the us from sydney in 1995.</v>

2508
01:56:50.630 --> 01:56:55.040
<v Speaker 2>Went to mit and the scientists in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>lab that I joined,</v>

2509
01:56:55.100 --> 01:56:58.910
<v Speaker 2>lenny guarantee's lab,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they two students had just started</v>

2510
01:56:58.911 --> 01:57:03.911
<v Speaker 2>working to figure out why east get old</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I joined as the third senior person</v>

2511
01:57:04.101 --> 01:57:06.770
<v Speaker 2>to join and all the other people in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>lab.</v>

2512
01:57:06.771 --> 01:57:08.810
<v Speaker 2>There were about 18,</v>
<v Speaker 2>19 people.</v>

2513
01:57:09.380 --> 01:57:10.970
<v Speaker 2>They said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are nuts.</v>

2514
01:57:11.210 --> 01:57:13.340
<v Speaker 2>Lenny's lost his mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's working on aging.</v>

2515
01:57:13.341 --> 01:57:15.080
<v Speaker 2>That's not a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should be working on what we do,</v>

2516
01:57:15.081 --> 01:57:16.820
<v Speaker 2>which is understanding how genes are</v>
<v Speaker 2>regulated.</v>

2517
01:57:17.510 --> 01:57:20.960
<v Speaker 2>So I called up my mom and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I've made a big mistake here.</v>

2518
01:57:20.961 --> 01:57:24.800
<v Speaker 2>I thought this was the thing and the guy</v>
<v Speaker 2>and everyone here says he's nuts.</v>

2519
01:57:27.090 --> 01:57:28.200
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were right.</v>

2520
01:57:28.980 --> 01:57:31.920
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you gotta take some risks in life.</v>

2521
01:57:31.950 --> 01:57:33.330
<v Speaker 2>That's one lesson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2522
01:57:33.331 --> 01:57:34.710
<v Speaker 2>but that's an interesting one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2523
01:57:34.711 --> 01:57:37.140
<v Speaker 2>Because you were a young fellow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't really.</v>

2524
01:57:37.560 --> 01:57:38.670
<v Speaker 2>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2525
01:57:39.660 --> 01:57:41.610
<v Speaker 2>It was pretty lucky because I'm in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Australia.</v>

2526
01:57:41.611 --> 01:57:43.230
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what people are saying</v>

2527
01:57:43.231 --> 01:57:46.120
<v Speaker 2>about this lab up there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2528
01:57:46.440 --> 01:57:48.810
<v Speaker 2>but always been fascinated with aging</v>
<v Speaker 2>since I was four.</v>

2529
01:57:48.900 --> 01:57:53.100
<v Speaker 2>Well now though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with all the promising new discoveries,</v>

2530
01:57:53.101 --> 01:57:56.790
<v Speaker 2>I mean they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have to be eating crow as it were.</v>

2531
01:57:58.820 --> 01:57:59.930
<v Speaker 2>Talk to those people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

2532
01:57:59.931 --> 01:58:00.711
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck face.</v>

2533
01:58:00.711 --> 01:58:01.770
<v Speaker 2>I was right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2534
01:58:02.360 --> 01:58:03.650
<v Speaker 2>don't call him up in the middle of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>night.</v>

2535
01:58:04.730 --> 01:58:06.160
<v Speaker 2>Drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2536
01:58:06.220 --> 01:58:10.160
<v Speaker 2>I definiTely forgive people too much and</v>
<v Speaker 2>had some pretty big enemies along the</v>

2537
01:58:10.161 --> 01:58:11.540
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I try to be nice.</v>

2538
01:58:11.630 --> 01:58:16.630
<v Speaker 2>Is it because of research and this sort</v>
<v Speaker 2>of scientific work is so competitive?</v>

2539
01:58:17.990 --> 01:58:18.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>

2540
01:58:18.740 --> 01:58:20.570
<v Speaker 2>It isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's this belief that someone's</v>

2541
01:58:20.571 --> 01:58:23.600
<v Speaker 2>success is your failure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not really that that is the case,</v>

2542
01:58:23.601 --> 01:58:28.601
<v Speaker 2>but it exists in show business too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so weird sort of a mindset.</v>

2543
01:58:28.671 --> 01:58:31.730
<v Speaker 2>It's a very limiting mindset.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

2544
01:58:31.731 --> 01:58:33.890
<v Speaker 2>and also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this may be true in hollywood,</v>

2545
01:58:33.891 --> 01:58:35.600
<v Speaker 2>in science,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you come up with a new idea when</v>

2546
01:58:35.601 --> 01:58:38.510
<v Speaker 2>you're young,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're young turk and you're upsetting</v>

2547
01:58:38.511 --> 01:58:42.130
<v Speaker 2>the status quo on the thomas kuhn's book</v>
<v Speaker 2>on structure</v>

2548
01:58:42.130 --> 01:58:44.950
<v Speaker 1>of scientific revolutions was just had</v>
<v Speaker 1>it had it right.</v>

2549
01:58:44.980 --> 01:58:47.470
<v Speaker 1>He wrote in the sixties that chemistry</v>
<v Speaker 1>and physics,</v>

2550
01:58:47.471 --> 01:58:50.230
<v Speaker 1>but it applies to biology that if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>come up with a new theory that's that</v>

2551
01:58:50.231 --> 01:58:54.130
<v Speaker 1>disruptive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the current leaders will attack you and</v>

2552
01:58:54.131 --> 01:58:57.160
<v Speaker 1>it's a period of chaos and you just have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get through it,</v>

2553
01:58:57.280 --> 01:59:00.640
<v Speaker 1>and fortunately I'd read kuhn's book and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew that this was normal,</v>

2554
01:59:01.060 --> 01:59:02.380
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of people around me were</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

2555
01:59:02.810 --> 01:59:04.600
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if people are saying we're wrong and</v>

2556
01:59:04.630 --> 01:59:06.460
<v Speaker 1>it's controversial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't want to be controversial.</v>

2557
01:59:06.461 --> 01:59:08.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>controversies,</v>

2558
01:59:08.260 --> 01:59:09.450
<v Speaker 1>great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's.</v>

2559
01:59:09.520 --> 01:59:11.470
<v Speaker 1>Let's do more of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if it's not controversial,</v>

2560
01:59:11.500 --> 01:59:13.720
<v Speaker 1>I don't Want to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is interesting.</v>

2561
01:59:13.721 --> 01:59:16.870
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that's because the people</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are the old guard or upset,</v>

2562
01:59:16.871 --> 01:59:21.700
<v Speaker 1>they didn't fight it themselves or they</v>
<v Speaker 1>upset that your new findings will make</v>

2563
01:59:21.701 --> 01:59:23.680
<v Speaker 1>their work look irrelevant?</v>

2564
01:59:25.090 --> 01:59:26.590
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's probably a bit of both,</v>

2565
01:59:26.591 --> 01:59:28.900
<v Speaker 1>but mostly it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's that they're worried that their</v>

2566
01:59:28.901 --> 01:59:32.530
<v Speaker 1>lives will be have been in vain if what</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're working on is not true.</v>

2567
01:59:32.740 --> 01:59:33.940
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2568
01:59:33.941 --> 01:59:37.090
<v Speaker 1>There's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an amazing documentary on the</v>

2569
01:59:37.091 --> 01:59:42.091
<v Speaker 1>sphinx where these geologists are</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about some of the water erosion</v>

2570
01:59:42.190 --> 01:59:45.760
<v Speaker 1>outside the area of the sphinx and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're saying this points to the fact</v>

2571
01:59:45.761 --> 01:59:49.120
<v Speaker 1>that construction was thousands of years</v>
<v Speaker 1>older than they thought and you see this</v>

2572
01:59:49.121 --> 01:59:52.330
<v Speaker 1>one egyptologist freaking out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's freakIng out.</v>

2573
01:59:52.331 --> 01:59:54.280
<v Speaker 1>Like what evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what evidence of this culture you're</v>

2574
01:59:54.281 --> 01:59:55.114
<v Speaker 1>talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2575
01:59:55.370 --> 02:00:00.370
<v Speaker 1>because apparently it would have</v>
<v Speaker 1>predated the known dates of 2,500 bc,</v>

2576
02:00:03.210 --> 02:00:06.760
<v Speaker 1>but if it made it like 7,000 years older</v>
<v Speaker 1>than that because it would have to be</v>

2577
02:00:06.761 --> 02:00:10.780
<v Speaker 1>back when there was rainfall in the nile</v>
<v Speaker 1>valley and you could see this guy's ego</v>

2578
02:00:10.781 --> 02:00:12.700
<v Speaker 1>kicking it because he was a professor.</v>

2579
02:00:12.880 --> 02:00:15.670
<v Speaker 1>He had been teaching egyptology and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>was freaking out.</v>

2580
02:00:15.671 --> 02:00:18.310
<v Speaker 1>Instead of examining this evidence like</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

2581
02:00:18.311 --> 02:00:22.090
<v Speaker 1>like talking to this geologist who</v>
<v Speaker 1>studies rocks and erosion,</v>

2582
02:00:22.400 --> 02:00:26.020
<v Speaker 1>who's really steadfast is a boston</v>
<v Speaker 1>university geologists,</v>

2583
02:00:26.170 --> 02:00:30.250
<v Speaker 1>dr robert schoch and you know he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying this is evidence of water erosion</v>

2584
02:00:30.251 --> 02:00:34.480
<v Speaker 1>and he's showing it and he even showed</v>
<v Speaker 1>it to a bunch of other geologists and</v>

2585
02:00:34.481 --> 02:00:38.430
<v Speaker 1>they all agreed and this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this egyptologist and this documentary</v>

2586
02:00:38.440 --> 02:00:39.430
<v Speaker 1>was freaking out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2587
02:00:39.431 --> 02:00:41.920
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what happens when you think your</v>

2588
02:00:41.921 --> 02:00:44.440
<v Speaker 1>whole life's work is horseshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2589
02:00:44.441 --> 02:00:46.840
<v Speaker 1>It can be a blow to the ego.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't lived through that yet.</v>

2590
02:00:47.050 --> 02:00:50.560
<v Speaker 1>It's probably coming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what I've noticed is that the really</v>

2591
02:00:50.561 --> 02:00:54.940
<v Speaker 1>successful scientists and people in life</v>
<v Speaker 1>just embrace change and that kInd of</v>

2592
02:00:54.941 --> 02:00:55.774
<v Speaker 1>have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2593
02:00:55.840 --> 02:00:58.120
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't mean that that guy is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>loser.</v>

2594
02:00:58.330 --> 02:01:03.330
<v Speaker 1>It just means he was acting on incorrect</v>
<v Speaker 1>information based on what they knew</v>

2595
02:01:03.341 --> 02:01:03.760
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>

2596
02:01:03.760 --> 02:01:05.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it should embrace it and say,</v>

2597
02:01:05.861 --> 02:01:07.870
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well we know certain things were built</v>

2598
02:01:07.871 --> 02:01:09.940
<v Speaker 1>at 2,500 bc,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the great pyramid.</v>

2599
02:01:09.941 --> 02:01:14.080
<v Speaker 1>That's been pretty clearly established,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it looks like there was some ancient</v>

2600
02:01:14.110 --> 02:01:16.390
<v Speaker 1>structures that were there even before</v>
<v Speaker 1>then.</v>

2601
02:01:16.600 --> 02:01:19.690
<v Speaker 1>Let's now we have new things to study if</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't look at it that way though.</v>

2602
02:01:20.080 --> 02:01:21.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See the problem with,</v>

2603
02:01:21.250 --> 02:01:23.980
<v Speaker 1>with how biology and actually most facts</v>
<v Speaker 1>a toilet,</v>

2604
02:01:24.450 --> 02:01:26.870
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>theories are taught is that there's a</v>

2605
02:01:26.871 --> 02:01:29.800
<v Speaker 1>textbook and that's the bible</v>
<v Speaker 1>equivalent.</v>

2606
02:01:30.140 --> 02:01:32.770
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whaT I try to teach my students is,</v>

2607
02:01:32.920 --> 02:01:36.460
<v Speaker 1>can you please just forget everything</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just learned and what's important to</v>

2608
02:01:36.461 --> 02:01:38.860
<v Speaker 1>know is that most things we think we</v>
<v Speaker 1>know are not,</v>

2609
02:01:39.530 --> 02:01:42.230
<v Speaker 1>they're going to change over time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Old Theories change.</v>

2610
02:01:42.320 --> 02:01:44.330
<v Speaker 1>Newton was wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he helped us get here,</v>

2611
02:01:44.950 --> 02:01:48.770
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>expect that we only know point.</v>

2612
02:01:48.800 --> 02:01:49.650
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one percent of,</v>

2613
02:01:49.960 --> 02:01:53.210
<v Speaker 1>of what we need to figure out and a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of what we think we know is wrong</v>

2614
02:01:53.211 --> 02:01:54.044
<v Speaker 1>anyway.</v>

2615
02:01:54.110 --> 02:01:57.050
<v Speaker 1>So even if you have the greatest theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>expect that it will be overturned,</v>

2616
02:01:57.051 --> 02:02:01.340
<v Speaker 1>but you can at least cherish the fact</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you've helped us get to that point.</v>

2617
02:02:01.341 --> 02:02:03.290
<v Speaker 1>Because without newton we wouldn't have</v>
<v Speaker 1>quantum physics.</v>

2618
02:02:03.440 --> 02:02:05.900
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for someone like me hearing you say</v>

2619
02:02:05.901 --> 02:02:08.060
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very promising and it's,</v>

2620
02:02:08.061 --> 02:02:09.650
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very encouraging.</v>

2621
02:02:10.100 --> 02:02:15.100
<v Speaker 1>but I always thought that scientists</v>
<v Speaker 1>were always going on just data,</v>

2622
02:02:18.650 --> 02:02:20.570
<v Speaker 1>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all they cared about was data,</v>

2623
02:02:20.780 --> 02:02:24.260
<v Speaker 1>all they cared about is what is correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was what was crucial.</v>

2624
02:02:24.530 --> 02:02:27.140
<v Speaker 1>That's what's important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what theY talk about.</v>

2625
02:02:27.141 --> 02:02:30.290
<v Speaker 1>This is what the study,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I found out that scientists would,</v>

2626
02:02:31.190 --> 02:02:36.190
<v Speaker 1>would ignore information or use their</v>
<v Speaker 1>own personal biases against information</v>

2627
02:02:36.771 --> 02:02:41.570
<v Speaker 1>or attack research because it somehow</v>
<v Speaker 1>negates what they've done is very</v>

2628
02:02:41.571 --> 02:02:44.270
<v Speaker 1>disheartening for someone who's not a</v>
<v Speaker 1>scientist.</v>

2629
02:02:44.630 --> 02:02:45.710
<v Speaker 1>And you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>

2630
02:02:45.740 --> 02:02:47.750
<v Speaker 1>the egos in science too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2631
02:02:47.810 --> 02:02:50.450
<v Speaker 1>It's disheartening as a scientist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you there Were,</v>

2632
02:02:50.540 --> 02:02:54.080
<v Speaker 1>there was a time of great change in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>aging field where we discover genes</v>

2633
02:02:54.081 --> 02:02:58.100
<v Speaker 1>control aging and molecules like where's</v>
<v Speaker 1>virtual could extend health and</v>

2634
02:02:58.101 --> 02:02:59.450
<v Speaker 1>lifespan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It Was,</v>

2635
02:02:59.451 --> 02:03:00.430
<v Speaker 1>it was brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

2636
02:03:00.650 --> 02:03:02.630
<v Speaker 1>I'd get up and I give a speech and</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone to say,</v>

2637
02:03:02.990 --> 02:03:04.520
<v Speaker 1>you're wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is crap.</v>

2638
02:03:04.521 --> 02:03:07.550
<v Speaker 1>And where are they now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you call them up in the middle of the</v>

2639
02:03:07.550 --> 02:03:08.300
<v Speaker 1>night?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2640
02:03:08.300 --> 02:03:09.700
<v Speaker 1>this dilemma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you</v>

2641
02:03:11.660 --> 02:03:13.710
<v Speaker 1>have a couple of glasses of wine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2642
02:03:14.270 --> 02:03:16.320
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the secret to success in life is</v>

2643
02:03:16.321 --> 02:03:20.690
<v Speaker 1>actually just existing for long enough</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all your enemies to fall away.</v>

2644
02:03:21.230 --> 02:03:21.801
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they die.</v>

2645
02:03:21.801 --> 02:03:23.950
<v Speaker 1>They're not into anti aging.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2646
02:03:24.060 --> 02:03:25.870
<v Speaker 1>Looks like shit and I can't walk</v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

2647
02:03:25.940 --> 02:03:29.120
<v Speaker 1>Just have to outlive your enemies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an easy way.</v>

2648
02:03:29.690 --> 02:03:33.440
<v Speaker 1>That must have been a tough time though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For you as a young man and you know,</v>

2649
02:03:33.441 --> 02:03:34.910
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're hearing this from these</v>

2650
02:03:34.911 --> 02:03:39.600
<v Speaker 1>established scientists and part of you</v>
<v Speaker 1>must have been like thinking like</v>

2651
02:03:39.620 --> 02:03:39.840
<v Speaker 1>cheese.</v>

2652
02:03:39.840 --> 02:03:41.720
<v Speaker 1>Are they right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>SUre.</v>

2653
02:03:41.780 --> 02:03:43.580
<v Speaker 1>You have to entertain the possibility</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're wrong,</v>

2654
02:03:43.660 --> 02:03:45.650
<v Speaker 1>that that's what we do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2655
02:03:45.680 --> 02:03:47.390
<v Speaker 1>but you go back to the lab and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>retest It.</v>

2656
02:03:47.480 --> 02:03:52.160
<v Speaker 1>So I went through a really brutal period</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my career where we had data,</v>

2657
02:03:52.161 --> 02:03:54.650
<v Speaker 1>we interpreted it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we published it in the top journals and</v>

2658
02:03:55.220 --> 02:03:59.090
<v Speaker 1>it was about how [inaudible] virtual</v>
<v Speaker 1>works on that sir to an enzyme that I</v>

2659
02:03:59.091 --> 02:04:03.260
<v Speaker 1>mentioned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And pfizer came out with a paper that</v>

2660
02:04:03.261 --> 02:04:07.070
<v Speaker 1>said it's all wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I had people call me Up Saying,</v>

2661
02:04:07.620 --> 02:04:08.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was nice knowing you.</v>

2662
02:04:08.871 --> 02:04:11.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm really sad for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's over.</v>

2663
02:04:11.330 --> 02:04:13.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bad luck.</v>

2664
02:04:14.120 --> 02:04:16.910
<v Speaker 1>And so I went back to the lab,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had some data already from yearS</v>

2665
02:04:16.911 --> 02:04:20.600
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I knew were interesting and it</v>

2666
02:04:20.601 --> 02:04:23.660
<v Speaker 1>took another thing for years to get to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bottom of it.</v>

2667
02:04:24.050 --> 02:04:28.370
<v Speaker 1>But it turns out in the end I was right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there were days when I said screw</v>

2668
02:04:28.371 --> 02:04:30.260
<v Speaker 1>humanity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't be bothered getting out of</v>

2669
02:04:30.261 --> 02:04:32.870
<v Speaker 1>bed if this is how I'm going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>treated for trying to devote my life to</v>

2670
02:04:32.871 --> 02:04:35.720
<v Speaker 1>the betterment of people's lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's tough.</v>

2671
02:04:35.780 --> 02:04:37.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I anybody who's</v>

2672
02:04:38.760 --> 02:04:42.720
<v Speaker 2>in a position in their career like that</v>
<v Speaker 2>has to have gone through really hard</v>

2673
02:04:42.750 --> 02:04:46.230
<v Speaker 2>times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just discouraging from a non</v>

2674
02:04:46.231 --> 02:04:51.231
<v Speaker 2>scientist who relies on people like you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For someone like me who relies on the</v>

2675
02:04:52.261 --> 02:04:55.470
<v Speaker 2>folks like you out there doing the hard</v>
<v Speaker 2>work that you would face,</v>

2676
02:04:55.530 --> 02:04:59.400
<v Speaker 2>that sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess the best way to describe it</v>

2677
02:04:59.401 --> 02:05:01.790
<v Speaker 2>would be ignorance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2678
02:05:01.980 --> 02:05:03.750
<v Speaker 2>it's okay for scientists to challenge a</v>
<v Speaker 2>theory.</v>

2679
02:05:03.751 --> 02:05:06.180
<v Speaker 2>That's what I did and what everybody is</v>
<v Speaker 2>trained to do.</v>

2680
02:05:06.520 --> 02:05:09.390
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to do it in such a public end and</v>

2681
02:05:09.850 --> 02:05:11.460
<v Speaker 2>vish controversial,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it Was vicious.</v>

2682
02:05:11.461 --> 02:05:14.250
<v Speaker 2>It was definitely vicious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even the words they used were vicious,</v>

2683
02:05:14.890 --> 02:05:16.650
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is really hurtful,</v>

2684
02:05:16.651 --> 02:05:17.700
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're wrong.</v>

2685
02:05:18.410 --> 02:05:21.090
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they might've been right or wrong.</v>

2686
02:05:21.150 --> 02:05:23.850
<v Speaker 2>I call them up middle of the night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You dumb motherfucker.</v>

2687
02:05:24.820 --> 02:05:28.470
<v Speaker 2>The person who published that paper,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do think about a meeting that person,</v>

2688
02:05:28.471 --> 02:05:31.620
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a droid careers.</v>

2689
02:05:31.620 --> 02:05:33.300
<v Speaker 2>it's not just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's tough.</v>

2690
02:05:33.780 --> 02:05:36.210
<v Speaker 2>You can run out of money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your students go away.</v>

2691
02:05:36.230 --> 02:05:37.620
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was happening to my left.</v>

2692
02:05:37.621 --> 02:05:39.470
<v Speaker 2>We went down to four people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2693
02:05:39.630 --> 02:05:40.870
<v Speaker 2>and what was the high?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2694
02:05:40.890 --> 02:05:44.010
<v Speaker 2>I mean these days I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what about before then?</v>

2695
02:05:44.011 --> 02:05:46.590
<v Speaker 2>It was about 80 slash 20.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you went down to four.</v>

2696
02:05:46.591 --> 02:05:48.240
<v Speaker 2>Four.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was looking bad.</v>

2697
02:05:48.780 --> 02:05:50.430
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People had written me off.</v>

2698
02:05:50.460 --> 02:05:53.640
<v Speaker 2>Holy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you were right.</v>

2699
02:05:54.630 --> 02:05:57.480
<v Speaker 2>When he got to push forward,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's you got to get lean because you're</v>

2700
02:05:57.481 --> 02:06:00.450
<v Speaker 2>not goIng to get government funding for</v>
<v Speaker 2>awhile because people think that you're</v>

2701
02:06:00.510 --> 02:06:02.280
<v Speaker 2>a failure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God damn,</v>

2702
02:06:02.520 --> 02:06:05.340
<v Speaker 2>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2703
02:06:05.341 --> 02:06:08.130
<v Speaker 2>science is not for the faint of heart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine.</v>

2704
02:06:08.690 --> 02:06:09.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boy.</v>

2705
02:06:09.470 --> 02:06:10.980
<v Speaker 2>Skin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thick skin.</v>

2706
02:06:11.020 --> 02:06:13.950
<v Speaker 2>A stubbornness only.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Only those survive.</v>

2707
02:06:15.990 --> 02:06:19.760
<v Speaker 2>What was the turnaround</v>
<v Speaker 2>like?</v>

2708
02:06:19.770 --> 02:06:23.250
<v Speaker 2>Was there a moment where it turned</v>
<v Speaker 2>around and moved in our favor?</v>

2709
02:06:23.340 --> 02:06:24.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was.</v>

2710
02:06:24.331 --> 02:06:26.190
<v Speaker 2>There was one day when it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When it all changed,</v>

2711
02:06:26.850 --> 02:06:30.060
<v Speaker 2>so the earlier data,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what data driven the early data was</v>

2712
02:06:30.061 --> 02:06:35.061
<v Speaker 2>that the enzyme we can we could mutate</v>
<v Speaker 2>or change the enzyme so that it wasn't</v>

2713
02:06:36.841 --> 02:06:41.320
<v Speaker 2>going to be activated by research and we</v>
<v Speaker 2>found that mutation now that just</v>

2714
02:06:41.340 --> 02:06:46.340
<v Speaker 2>technically or non tickling technically</v>
<v Speaker 2>means that we could change the enzyme in</v>

2715
02:06:46.951 --> 02:06:50.310
<v Speaker 2>a way it wouldn't work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we didn't put that nonworking enzyme</v>

2716
02:06:50.311 --> 02:06:55.311
<v Speaker 2>into a cell and now we have a mouse that</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't work and we give it resveratrol</v>

2717
02:06:55.351 --> 02:06:57.660
<v Speaker 2>virtual and if it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it works,</v>

2718
02:06:57.810 --> 02:07:00.210
<v Speaker 2>it means I'm wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it doesn't work and it's blocked by</v>

2719
02:07:00.211 --> 02:07:04.590
<v Speaker 2>that change in the enzyme will probably</v>
<v Speaker 2>right and that's what we did.</v>

2720
02:07:04.980 --> 02:07:08.040
<v Speaker 2>But the real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the real change was that there was a</v>

2721
02:07:08.041 --> 02:07:10.530
<v Speaker 2>company that I started that was making</v>
<v Speaker 2>drugs,</v>

2722
02:07:10.980 --> 02:07:15.980
<v Speaker 2>the one that a cure or at least seemed</v>
<v Speaker 2>to cure psoriasis and they had made</v>

2723
02:07:17.341 --> 02:07:21.060
<v Speaker 2>these very synthetic molecules that were</v>
<v Speaker 2>not related to the plant molecule</v>

2724
02:07:21.160 --> 02:07:21.993
<v Speaker 2>residual.</v>

2725
02:07:22.380 --> 02:07:25.950
<v Speaker 2>And so I said to myself and to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>student who was working on it,</v>

2726
02:07:26.250 --> 02:07:30.900
<v Speaker 2>they're very brave student if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the change in that enzyme also blocks</v>

2727
02:07:30.901 --> 02:07:34.980
<v Speaker 2>the drug,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then we're onto something because that</v>

2728
02:07:34.990 --> 02:07:38.470
<v Speaker 2>means two separate groups working on</v>
<v Speaker 2>separate types of molecules,</v>

2729
02:07:39.100 --> 02:07:43.270
<v Speaker 2>different people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>different systems all get blocked by</v>

2730
02:07:43.271 --> 02:07:45.970
<v Speaker 2>this one little change in the enzyme,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then we're right.</v>

2731
02:07:46.440 --> 02:07:48.340
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so he walked over to the company,</v>

2732
02:07:48.341 --> 02:07:50.800
<v Speaker 2>got the molecule,</v>
<v Speaker 2>throw it on the enzyme and it didn't</v>

2733
02:07:50.801 --> 02:07:55.801
<v Speaker 2>work on the mutant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was me a rejoicing because I</v>

2734
02:07:56.141 --> 02:08:00.700
<v Speaker 2>could say there was a universal</v>
<v Speaker 2>activation mechanism on this one enzyme,</v>

2735
02:08:01.270 --> 02:08:03.160
<v Speaker 2>rich virtual works,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2736
02:08:03.580 --> 02:08:07.480
<v Speaker 2>the molecules at the company work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now there's an interesting thing</v>

2737
02:08:07.481 --> 02:08:10.060
<v Speaker 2>that just came out from Spain that</v>
<v Speaker 2>metformin,</v>

2738
02:08:10.330 --> 02:08:15.100
<v Speaker 2>the diabetes drug may actually work the</v>
<v Speaker 2>same way as these other molecules by</v>

2739
02:08:15.101 --> 02:08:19.180
<v Speaker 2>activating our favorite enzyme,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sirtuin wow.</v>

2740
02:08:19.930 --> 02:08:22.370
<v Speaker 2>And how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much time were you in the dark</v>

2741
02:08:22.371 --> 02:08:25.770
<v Speaker 2>lands?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a couple of years of hell,</v>

2742
02:08:28.020 --> 02:08:30.040
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it gets so bad because you've got</v>

2743
02:08:30.041 --> 02:08:33.250
<v Speaker 2>this tight knit group of scientists and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have lab meetings and you present</v>

2744
02:08:33.251 --> 02:08:35.500
<v Speaker 2>your results and usually you're very</v>
<v Speaker 2>supportive trying to help.</v>

2745
02:08:36.280 --> 02:08:40.570
<v Speaker 2>I had one guy saying to my student,</v>
<v Speaker 2>david doesn't always talking about you</v>

2746
02:08:40.571 --> 02:08:42.280
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't work on this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's been proven wrong.</v>

2747
02:08:42.281 --> 02:08:46.120
<v Speaker 2>He was dead against me in my own lab.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm paying your salary and it's okay to</v>

2748
02:08:46.121 --> 02:08:49.030
<v Speaker 2>be constructive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but vicious within my own group.</v>

2749
02:08:49.510 --> 02:08:50.500
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Suffice to say,</v>

2750
02:08:50.501 --> 02:08:53.080
<v Speaker 2>he wasn't in my group for that long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2751
02:08:53.140 --> 02:08:56.350
<v Speaker 2>Now this other guy that used all these</v>
<v Speaker 2>other vicious words about you.</v>

2752
02:08:56.440 --> 02:08:58.210
<v Speaker 2>Where's he at now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not sure.</v>

2753
02:08:58.990 --> 02:09:00.910
<v Speaker 2>I would know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would know.</v>

2754
02:09:02.290 --> 02:09:04.720
<v Speaker 2>Now I don't have time to look back on</v>
<v Speaker 2>your iphone.</v>

2755
02:09:04.721 --> 02:09:05.590
<v Speaker 2>You're nicer than me.</v>

2756
02:09:08.210 --> 02:09:09.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>

2757
02:09:09.310 --> 02:09:13.360
<v Speaker 2>I'm in science because it's very</v>
<v Speaker 2>collaborative and you're often.</v>

2758
02:09:13.361 --> 02:09:15.790
<v Speaker 2>Your enemies are reviewing your own</v>
<v Speaker 2>work.</v>

2759
02:09:16.780 --> 02:09:19.240
<v Speaker 2>If you build up too many enemies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you won't survive,</v>

2760
02:09:19.250 --> 02:09:22.720
<v Speaker 2>so it's definitely healthier approach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure I probably would do exactly</v>

2761
02:09:22.721 --> 02:09:25.360
<v Speaker 2>what you did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it still has got to be beautiful to</v>

2762
02:09:25.390 --> 02:09:28.540
<v Speaker 2>come out on the other end and be proven.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Correct,</v>

2763
02:09:28.541 --> 02:09:32.230
<v Speaker 2>and actually be at the forefront of</v>
<v Speaker 2>these emerging technologies.</v>

2764
02:09:32.440 --> 02:09:33.201
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2765
02:09:33.201 --> 02:09:33.610
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

2766
02:09:33.610 --> 02:09:36.520
<v Speaker 2>it is an arm rest on any laurels,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>

2767
02:09:37.930 --> 02:09:41.530
<v Speaker 2>what I do is I pause and I remember how</v>
<v Speaker 2>hard it was to get here and how</v>

2768
02:09:41.531 --> 02:09:45.100
<v Speaker 2>fortunate I am to have made it this far</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm working with hundreds of</v>

2769
02:09:45.550 --> 02:09:48.040
<v Speaker 2>collaborators around the world to make</v>
<v Speaker 2>this come true.</v>

2770
02:09:48.041 --> 02:09:52.000
<v Speaker 2>This idea that we can really treat aging</v>
<v Speaker 2>and prevent deterioration.</v>

2771
02:09:52.450 --> 02:09:55.180
<v Speaker 2>So I'm blessed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have an app on my phone that I've</v>

2772
02:09:55.540 --> 02:09:56.410
<v Speaker 2>helped engineer.</v>

2773
02:09:56.590 --> 02:09:59.280
<v Speaker 2>What's that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's called lucy liu a.</v>

2774
02:09:59.281 --> 02:10:02.070
<v Speaker 2>And where does that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2775
02:10:02.300 --> 02:10:05.140
<v Speaker 2>well it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a little company that we bought in</v>

2776
02:10:05.141 --> 02:10:10.141
<v Speaker 2>New York and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nurses and dentists use it to pass</v>

2777
02:10:11.381 --> 02:10:15.550
<v Speaker 2>medical information around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we use it to share information</v>

2778
02:10:15.580 --> 02:10:20.080
<v Speaker 2>between scientists around the world and</v>
<v Speaker 2>coordinate activities between companies</v>

2779
02:10:20.250 --> 02:10:21.790
<v Speaker 2>that started.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2780
02:10:22.180 --> 02:10:23.440
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2781
02:10:23.441 --> 02:10:26.020
<v Speaker 2>I think I mentioned to you that I've</v>
<v Speaker 2>started a few companies.</v>

2782
02:10:26.500 --> 02:10:29.920
<v Speaker 2>What I'm trying to build our companies</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are the 21st century version of a</v>

2783
02:10:29.921 --> 02:10:34.921
<v Speaker 2>pharma company that is actually has a</v>
<v Speaker 2>decent reputation in the world.</v>

2784
02:10:35.330 --> 02:10:38.300
<v Speaker 2>I think it's pharmaceutical companies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's deserved or not,</v>

2785
02:10:38.301 --> 02:10:41.270
<v Speaker 2>have a pretty bad rap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying not to fall into that trap,</v>

2786
02:10:41.271 --> 02:10:45.110
<v Speaker 2>but I'm also trying to use 21st century</v>
<v Speaker 2>technology to not become too</v>

2787
02:10:45.111 --> 02:10:47.450
<v Speaker 2>bureaucratic as well within the</v>
<v Speaker 2>organization.</v>

2788
02:10:47.490 --> 02:10:49.370
<v Speaker 2>That's what the luma app offers us.</v>

2789
02:10:49.760 --> 02:10:51.740
<v Speaker 3>You were also talking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you could talk about</v>

2790
02:10:51.741 --> 02:10:55.130
<v Speaker 3>this before the podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about how you have to make sure you have</v>

2791
02:10:55.131 --> 02:10:56.750
<v Speaker 3>zero conflicts of interest.</v>

2792
02:10:58.780 --> 02:10:59.291
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard.</v>

2793
02:10:59.291 --> 02:11:01.720
<v Speaker 2>So I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't sell any supplements.</v>

2794
02:11:01.721 --> 02:11:03.280
<v Speaker 2>I don't endorse anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2795
02:11:03.340 --> 02:11:05.470
<v Speaker 2>no products.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you look on the internet,</v>

2796
02:11:05.471 --> 02:11:08.560
<v Speaker 2>if you google david sinclair and nad or</v>
<v Speaker 2>aging,</v>

2797
02:11:08.561 --> 02:11:12.130
<v Speaker 2>you'll see that people put my name and</v>
<v Speaker 2>my face all the time on their websites</v>

2798
02:11:12.131 --> 02:11:15.280
<v Speaker 2>and I get questions every day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every morning I wake up.</v>

2799
02:11:15.940 --> 02:11:20.940
<v Speaker 2>Which product are you endorsing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I have to be extremely careful.</v>

2800
02:11:21.100 --> 02:11:23.740
<v Speaker 2>So do you have to have your lawyer</v>
<v Speaker 2>contact those companies?</v>

2801
02:11:23.780 --> 02:11:26.250
<v Speaker 2>Tell them to take your name?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2802
02:11:26.630 --> 02:11:28.540
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a fair amount of money always</v>

2803
02:11:28.541 --> 02:11:31.270
<v Speaker 2>sending out cease and desist letters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I have to do it.</v>

2804
02:11:31.300 --> 02:11:34.870
<v Speaker 2>My reputation is everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And also want to be able to have</v>

2805
02:11:34.871 --> 02:11:39.600
<v Speaker 2>opinions on these molecules without</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone accusing me of doing it for</v>

2806
02:11:39.610 --> 02:11:39.970
<v Speaker 2>profit.</v>

2807
02:11:39.970 --> 02:11:42.700
<v Speaker 3>That's what I would think would be</v>
<v Speaker 3>because of anybody could point to that</v>

2808
02:11:42.701 --> 02:11:43.420
<v Speaker 3>and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

2809
02:11:43.420 --> 02:11:45.910
<v Speaker 3>he endorses this because he's making</v>
<v Speaker 3>money.</v>

2810
02:11:46.070 --> 02:11:46.903
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2811
02:11:48.130 --> 02:11:49.810
<v Speaker 3>That's what would be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2812
02:11:49.811 --> 02:11:53.200
<v Speaker 3>that would be the thing that means</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially because most people aren't</v>

2813
02:11:53.201 --> 02:11:57.700
<v Speaker 3>going to do real research and developed</v>
<v Speaker 3>a nuanced understanding of your work and</v>

2814
02:11:57.701 --> 02:12:00.430
<v Speaker 3>what you're doing and what it means and</v>
<v Speaker 3>how long you've been studying it.</v>

2815
02:12:00.730 --> 02:12:01.271
<v Speaker 3>They go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2816
02:12:01.271 --> 02:12:03.190
<v Speaker 3>he's doing it because he's making money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm done</v>

2817
02:12:03.700 --> 02:12:04.450
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2818
02:12:04.450 --> 02:12:04.841
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2819
02:12:04.841 --> 02:12:06.820
<v Speaker 2>I've made a fair amount of money in my</v>
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

2820
02:12:06.821 --> 02:12:09.310
<v Speaker 2>My first company,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though it wasn't the major</v>

2821
02:12:09.311 --> 02:12:11.440
<v Speaker 2>shareholder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was sold for north of 700,</v>

2822
02:12:11.441 --> 02:12:15.250
<v Speaker 2>$20,000,000.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that money I'm not immune to,</v>

2823
02:12:15.280 --> 02:12:19.690
<v Speaker 2>but I do reinvest almost all of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually all of it.</v>

2824
02:12:19.720 --> 02:12:23.590
<v Speaker 2>My wife will tell you into new ventures</v>
<v Speaker 2>to change the world.</v>

2825
02:12:23.591 --> 02:12:28.150
<v Speaker 2>So the lyme disease company and the miv</v>
<v Speaker 2>66 company metro.</v>

2826
02:12:28.480 --> 02:12:32.110
<v Speaker 2>These are funded initially by me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now the conflict arises because I'm</v>

2827
02:12:32.111 --> 02:12:35.470
<v Speaker 2>studying these molecules in the lab and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm on the board of directors and</v>

2828
02:12:35.471 --> 02:12:37.480
<v Speaker 2>advising these companies as chairman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>vice chairman,</v>

2829
02:12:38.440 --> 02:12:40.480
<v Speaker 2>the only way around that as a scientist</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we,</v>

2830
02:12:41.190 --> 02:12:42.690
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we have is our defenses.</v>

2831
02:12:42.730 --> 02:12:46.990
<v Speaker 2>We disclose everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So initially I would disclose it to the</v>

2832
02:12:46.991 --> 02:12:50.020
<v Speaker 2>government and to harvard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All scientists have to do that,</v>

2833
02:12:50.021 --> 02:12:54.190
<v Speaker 2>but I've gone a step further just to try</v>
<v Speaker 2>and beat ultra transparent with the</v>

2834
02:12:54.191 --> 02:12:54.940
<v Speaker 2>public.</v>

2835
02:12:54.940 --> 02:12:57.100
<v Speaker 2>And so I have a website.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you go to my lab's website,</v>

2836
02:12:57.101 --> 02:12:59.650
<v Speaker 2>you'll see everything that I do and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2837
02:12:59.890 --> 02:13:04.890
<v Speaker 2>and hopefully that's a protection from</v>
<v Speaker 2>being accused of being biased.</v>

2838
02:13:05.351 --> 02:13:09.400
<v Speaker 2>But what I definitely do in my lab is I</v>
<v Speaker 2>say to the students,</v>

2839
02:13:09.490 --> 02:13:13.270
<v Speaker 2>if you get a whiff that I'm doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything biased,</v>

2840
02:13:13.271 --> 02:13:14.650
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't do anything consciously,</v>

2841
02:13:14.651 --> 02:13:17.380
<v Speaker 2>but maybe there's some unconscious bias,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me know,</v>

2842
02:13:17.440 --> 02:13:21.400
<v Speaker 2>let the university know and we'd find.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I've been doing this for 25 years.</v>

2843
02:13:21.870 --> 02:13:24.790
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I'm pretty good at putting a,</v>

2844
02:13:25.480 --> 02:13:27.660
<v Speaker 2>a wall between the two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2845
02:13:28.270 --> 02:13:31.030
<v Speaker 2>and the other thing that I want</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody to know is in the,</v>

2846
02:13:31.230 --> 02:13:33.780
<v Speaker 2>we do very basic research.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We try to understand the fundamental</v>

2847
02:13:34.110 --> 02:13:35.940
<v Speaker 2>reasons why we age and how to reverse</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2848
02:13:36.570 --> 02:13:39.060
<v Speaker 2>The companies are more worried about how</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to do a clinical trial,</v>

2849
02:13:39.090 --> 02:13:41.640
<v Speaker 2>which is very different worlds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they don't overlap much.</v>

2850
02:13:42.420 --> 02:13:46.510
<v Speaker 2>now when you want to bring something to</v>
<v Speaker 2>try or something to the market or do you</v>

2851
02:13:46.520 --> 02:13:50.070
<v Speaker 2>want to try somethIng on people?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the process like?</v>

2852
02:13:50.071 --> 02:13:54.810
<v Speaker 2>Say if you have some sort of a molecule</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you want to try out on people,</v>

2853
02:13:54.811 --> 02:13:57.330
<v Speaker 2>what is that process?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2854
02:13:57.331 --> 02:14:01.470
<v Speaker 2>so it's a few years have often making it</v>
<v Speaker 2>better molecule.</v>

2855
02:14:01.471 --> 02:14:06.471
<v Speaker 2>But let's say you've done that work now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You spent a year testing it on at least</v>

2856
02:14:06.631 --> 02:14:08.940
<v Speaker 2>two different species.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm usually a rodent,</v>

2857
02:14:09.120 --> 02:14:14.100
<v Speaker 2>a mouse and a dog and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you try to do everything you can</v>

2858
02:14:14.101 --> 02:14:16.110
<v Speaker 2>before that to make sure it's not going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be unsafe.</v>

2859
02:14:16.350 --> 02:14:20.420
<v Speaker 2>Testing on cells and other things that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are not living or at least not,</v>

2860
02:14:20.550 --> 02:14:25.320
<v Speaker 2>not to feel anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the fda food and drug administration</v>

2861
02:14:25.321 --> 02:14:27.360
<v Speaker 2>of the us requires.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you can make a drug,</v>

2862
02:14:27.361 --> 02:14:29.430
<v Speaker 2>you have to test it on at least two</v>
<v Speaker 2>different species,</v>

2863
02:14:29.670 --> 02:14:33.300
<v Speaker 2>so that's what you do and then it's you</v>
<v Speaker 2>go into what's called phase one,</v>

2864
02:14:33.301 --> 02:14:36.180
<v Speaker 2>which is safety testing takes one to two</v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

2865
02:14:36.630 --> 02:14:40.080
<v Speaker 2>Phase two is what we call efficacy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is does it really work?</v>

2866
02:14:40.110 --> 02:14:43.530
<v Speaker 2>Potentially,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you test that on 50 to 100 people.</v>

2867
02:14:44.310 --> 02:14:45.540
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it works,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe it doesn't.</v>

2868
02:14:45.541 --> 02:14:47.610
<v Speaker 2>Most things fail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it looks good,</v>

2869
02:14:47.611 --> 02:14:51.390
<v Speaker 2>then you go into phase three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is 50 to $200,000,000 worth of</v>

2870
02:14:51.391 --> 02:14:56.391
<v Speaker 2>experiments and testing it on hundreds</v>
<v Speaker 2>of patients and if that goes well,</v>

2871
02:14:56.431 --> 02:15:00.210
<v Speaker 2>then you apply to the fda to be licensed</v>
<v Speaker 2>to sell a drug.</v>

2872
02:15:00.450 --> 02:15:05.450
<v Speaker 2>So the amount of money that it must cost</v>
<v Speaker 2>to bring something to mr years open</v>

2873
02:15:06.371 --> 02:15:07.940
<v Speaker 2>neural or who?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>

2874
02:15:08.180 --> 02:15:09.930
<v Speaker 2>It's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It must be staggering.</v>

2875
02:15:10.310 --> 02:15:14.340
<v Speaker 2>It's staggering to raise that much money</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that that's one of the reasons that</v>

2876
02:15:14.850 --> 02:15:16.110
<v Speaker 2>these big numbers come up.</v>

2877
02:15:18.360 --> 02:15:21.960
<v Speaker 2>Often we have to tap the public markets</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be able to afford it because a</v>

2878
02:15:21.961 --> 02:15:25.260
<v Speaker 2>typical drug will cost hundreds of</v>
<v Speaker 2>millions of dollars.</v>

2879
02:15:25.650 --> 02:15:28.110
<v Speaker 2>Some drugs have failed after</v>
<v Speaker 2>$700,000,000 investment.</v>

2880
02:15:28.170 --> 02:15:29.820
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

2881
02:15:29.940 --> 02:15:33.180
<v Speaker 2>but look at the upside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we're successful at having a drug</v>

2882
02:15:33.840 --> 02:15:38.730
<v Speaker 2>that treats aging</v>
<v Speaker 2>will treat a disease like diabetes</v>

2883
02:15:38.731 --> 02:15:41.520
<v Speaker 2>first,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then it could become the best</v>

2884
02:15:41.521 --> 02:15:44.220
<v Speaker 2>selling drug of all time if it's proven</v>
<v Speaker 2>safe.</v>

2885
02:15:44.850 --> 02:15:47.280
<v Speaker 2>Who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who wouldn't want to have a drug that</v>

2886
02:15:47.281 --> 02:15:49.230
<v Speaker 2>could protect them from all these major</v>
<v Speaker 2>diseases?</v>

2887
02:15:49.590 --> 02:15:51.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But how much would something where you'd</v>

2888
02:15:51.241 --> 02:15:55.170
<v Speaker 2>have to sell it for so much wanted to</v>
<v Speaker 2>make makeup for all the research money,</v>

2889
02:15:55.171 --> 02:15:56.490
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is how it works.</v>

2890
02:15:57.660 --> 02:16:01.220
<v Speaker 2>That's how it usually works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But for the first time I'm,</v>

2891
02:16:01.270 --> 02:16:05.310
<v Speaker 2>I'm in control of many of these</v>
<v Speaker 2>companies and I have a large say in them</v>

2892
02:16:06.120 --> 02:16:09.780
<v Speaker 2>at least.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I as an individual,</v>

2893
02:16:09.781 --> 02:16:11.520
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and pledging that we won't do that.</v>

2894
02:16:11.670 --> 02:16:15.900
<v Speaker 2>We're not going to put our prices up to</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the market can bear.</v>

2895
02:16:15.901 --> 02:16:18.000
<v Speaker 2>We want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a gift to the world.</v>

2896
02:16:18.001 --> 02:16:20.490
<v Speaker 2>And so that's a very different approach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's one of the reasons that I've</v>

2897
02:16:21.150 --> 02:16:23.580
<v Speaker 2>enlarged part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>used my own money to do these things so</v>

2898
02:16:23.581 --> 02:16:26.100
<v Speaker 2>I can have that say and do what's right</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the planet.</v>

2899
02:16:26.520 --> 02:16:30.130
<v Speaker 2>So when you do do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how you decide</v>

2900
02:16:30.130 --> 02:16:34.870
<v Speaker 1>how much something costs based on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ability to just maintain the company?</v>

2901
02:16:35.440 --> 02:16:35.950
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2902
02:16:35.950 --> 02:16:37.720
<v Speaker 1>we have to be profitable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>otherwise it'll,</v>

2903
02:16:37.750 --> 02:16:39.100
<v Speaker 1>it'll goes away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2904
02:16:39.270 --> 02:16:41.050
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not to.</v>

2905
02:16:41.051 --> 02:16:43.720
<v Speaker 1>The point of extortion note is there's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>nice middle ground and what?</v>

2906
02:16:43.721 --> 02:16:45.100
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to be like that guy that</v>

2907
02:16:45.101 --> 02:16:47.500
<v Speaker 1>went to jail for the aids drug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's set assholes name,</v>

2908
02:16:49.020 --> 02:16:52.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that kid you squarely cotton's</v>

2909
02:16:52.580 --> 02:16:53.830
<v Speaker 1>currently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2910
02:16:53.920 --> 02:16:55.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had very different view and I'm</v>

2911
02:16:55.511 --> 02:16:59.110
<v Speaker 1>hoping that we'll have a new type of</v>
<v Speaker 1>pharmaceutical company emerging out of</v>

2912
02:16:59.111 --> 02:17:01.930
<v Speaker 1>what we're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing,</v>

2913
02:17:01.931 --> 02:17:03.640
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because pharmaceutical drug companies</v>

2914
02:17:03.641 --> 02:17:06.010
<v Speaker 1>are always thought as being a devil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

2915
02:17:06.100 --> 02:17:09.430
<v Speaker 1>They're responsible for so many things</v>
<v Speaker 1>to keep people alive as well.</v>

2916
02:17:09.760 --> 02:17:13.270
<v Speaker 1>But because of the fact they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>connected to things like oxycontin and</v>

2917
02:17:13.271 --> 02:17:17.110
<v Speaker 1>fentanyl and things that kill people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's been proven that there are</v>

2918
02:17:17.111 --> 02:17:21.580
<v Speaker 1>certain unscrupulous drug companies that</v>
<v Speaker 1>have pushed things out there that they</v>

2919
02:17:21.581 --> 02:17:24.460
<v Speaker 1>know have negative effects because they</v>
<v Speaker 1>knew they could profit from it.</v>

2920
02:17:25.480 --> 02:17:26.320
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2921
02:17:26.500 --> 02:17:30.580
<v Speaker 1>not everybody's ethical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as long as I have a say in these</v>

2922
02:17:30.581 --> 02:17:32.200
<v Speaker 1>companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they will be ultra ethical.</v>

2923
02:17:32.290 --> 02:17:34.030
<v Speaker 1>You've got to make sure that you stay</v>
<v Speaker 1>alive.</v>

2924
02:17:34.090 --> 02:17:35.590
<v Speaker 1>They're going to try to take you out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bro.</v>

2925
02:17:36.110 --> 02:17:37.280
<v Speaker 1>Hell yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2926
02:17:37.330 --> 02:17:40.120
<v Speaker 1>I don't know about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but take control of the company.</v>

2927
02:17:40.690 --> 02:17:43.810
<v Speaker 1>I've found prophets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I found like minded investors for the</v>

2928
02:17:43.811 --> 02:17:45.460
<v Speaker 1>first time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing too.</v>

2929
02:17:45.520 --> 02:17:46.240
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>

2930
02:17:46.240 --> 02:17:49.470
<v Speaker 1>how have you managed to cultivate that</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationships?</v>

2931
02:17:50.110 --> 02:17:53.680
<v Speaker 1>It's harder than going with a pitch to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>capitalist,</v>

2932
02:17:53.681 --> 02:17:54.600
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2933
02:17:54.850 --> 02:17:59.800
<v Speaker 1>it's mainly meeting the right people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to say that they're on board too.</v>

2934
02:17:59.980 --> 02:18:02.200
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to just have somebody who's</v>
<v Speaker 1>out to make a profit.</v>

2935
02:18:02.220 --> 02:18:03.820
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you still can make a profit</v>

2936
02:18:04.570 --> 02:18:08.630
<v Speaker 1>profitable but don't go crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2937
02:18:09.130 --> 02:18:10.450
<v Speaker 1>Help the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2938
02:18:10.451 --> 02:18:13.600
<v Speaker 1>And so we just recruited to one of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>boards of the company,</v>

2939
02:18:13.630 --> 02:18:17.380
<v Speaker 1>someone from a consumer company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a strange choice,</v>

2940
02:18:17.381 --> 02:18:18.100
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2941
02:18:18.100 --> 02:18:21.070
<v Speaker 1>But this is a person who's done right at</v>
<v Speaker 1>that company for the world.</v>

2942
02:18:21.690 --> 02:18:24.970
<v Speaker 1>I'm a company that used to make just</v>
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>

2943
02:18:25.600 --> 02:18:27.130
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you want products that weren't</v>

2944
02:18:27.131 --> 02:18:31.630
<v Speaker 1>healthy and he turned that around and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the kind of person I want to work</v>

2945
02:18:31.631 --> 02:18:33.130
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who cares about the pLanet more than</v>

2946
02:18:33.131 --> 02:18:36.430
<v Speaker 1>they care about the ultimate profit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's awesome man.</v>

2947
02:18:36.520 --> 02:18:37.980
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep me.</v>

2948
02:18:38.320 --> 02:18:40.590
<v Speaker 1>Keep me in the loop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to know what's going on and I'm</v>

2949
02:18:40.600 --> 02:18:41.890
<v Speaker 1>gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Try all these things that you said.</v>

2950
02:18:41.891 --> 02:18:44.890
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to go out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to buy some nmn.</v>

2951
02:18:45.220 --> 02:18:50.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to buy some resveratrol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gotta find a quack that's willing to</v>

2952
02:18:50.171 --> 02:18:51.670
<v Speaker 1>prescribe me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Metformin.</v>

2953
02:18:53.290 --> 02:18:56.170
<v Speaker 1>Got shade.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll talk later.</v>

2954
02:18:56.710 --> 02:18:58.300
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the other stuff,</v>

2955
02:18:58.301 --> 02:18:59.980
<v Speaker 1>the srt 21.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2956
02:18:59.981 --> 02:19:02.020
<v Speaker 1>four.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That stuff.</v>

2957
02:19:02.440 --> 02:19:04.840
<v Speaker 1>Where would one get that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's experimental.</v>

2958
02:19:04.841 --> 02:19:06.730
<v Speaker 1>That's probably the hardest one to help</v>
<v Speaker 1>you with.</v>

2959
02:19:07.080 --> 02:19:10.150
<v Speaker 1>You need to pay somebody off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2960
02:19:10.240 --> 02:19:14.830
<v Speaker 1>anything else I need to know about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Said it.</v>

2961
02:19:15.010 --> 02:19:19.120
<v Speaker 1>Have you had you just 23 and me</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically,</v>

2962
02:19:19.270 --> 02:19:20.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't.</v>

2963
02:19:20.290 --> 02:19:23.440
<v Speaker 1>Is there more extensive versions of it</v>
<v Speaker 1>than that?</v>

2964
02:19:23.980 --> 02:19:25.030
<v Speaker 1>There are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2965
02:19:25.220 --> 02:19:27.620
<v Speaker 1>they're a few thousand bucks to you hold</v>
<v Speaker 1>genome and we can do that,</v>

2966
02:19:27.621 --> 02:19:30.800
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think you'll learn a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>more mainly because we're ignorant as to</v>

2967

<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2968
02:19:32.420 --> 02:19:36.920
<v Speaker 1>It was pretty interesting though as far</v>
<v Speaker 1>as finding out about my ancestry and</v>

2969
02:19:36.950 --> 02:19:38.900
<v Speaker 1>where my relatives come from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2970
02:19:38.990 --> 02:19:42.020
<v Speaker 1>it's a good start.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I learned some really interesting things</v>

2971
02:19:42.030 --> 02:19:46.360
<v Speaker 1>too about my origins and I'm carrying</v>
<v Speaker 1>cystic fibrosis gene and whatever.</v>

2972
02:19:46.390 --> 02:19:49.790
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what's cool is now emerging,</v>

2973
02:19:49.850 --> 02:19:54.560
<v Speaker 1>you can merge that data with the inside</v>
<v Speaker 1>tracker data and have this ultimate</v>

2974
02:19:55.160 --> 02:19:58.390
<v Speaker 1>personal angel for health that will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>we've got the personal tracking device.</v>

2976
02:20:02.540 --> 02:20:04.280
<v Speaker 1>IT'll tell us if there's something going</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>

2977
02:20:04.281 --> 02:20:06.620
<v Speaker 1>If you are a cancer cell detected,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go get that eliminated.</v>

2978
02:20:07.130 --> 02:20:09.350

<v Speaker 1>you actually go to the doctor.</v>
