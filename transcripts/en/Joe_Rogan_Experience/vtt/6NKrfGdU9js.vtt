Hello everybody.

2
00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.890
This episode of the podcast is brought to you by Squarespace,

3
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.340
the all in one platform that makes it fast and easy to create your own

4
00:00:14.341 --> 00:00:15.540
professional website.

5
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.890
There was a time not long ago where it was impossible do what you can do with

6
00:00:19.891 --> 00:00:20.521
Squarespace.

7
00:00:20.521 --> 00:00:25.521
You had to learn html or you had to learn a program that processes html was a

8
00:00:25.951 --> 00:00:28.440
huge pain in the ass.

9
00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.290
You had to hire some fucking flaky dude,

10
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.670
probably would never get your website done on time and even when he did weren't

11
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.140
probably happy with it and you could get a really professional website.

12
00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.980
You could do it yourself on Squarespace and you could do it really easily.

13
00:00:43.981 --> 00:00:45.870
Brian has done,
I don't know,

14
00:00:45.871 --> 00:00:48.680
dozens of them during the time that we've done commercials,

15
00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.900
like literally in the,
in the time we're doing a Squarespace commercial,

16
00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.880
by the time the commercial's over,
he's had a website drag and drop interface.

17
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.380
Super simple to use.
It's if you can attach a photograph to your email,

32
00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.880
That shit's wack.
You guys need to rewind that.

And what we sell is everything that I and my friend Aubrey have found to be

37
00:02:23.401 --> 00:02:28.170
beneficial as far as performance,
as far as cognitive performance,

38
00:02:28.171 --> 00:02:30.600
as far as strength and conditioning equipment.

39
00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:34.410
We sell the finest products we can find,

a steel maces,
steel clubs.

41
00:02:38.581 --> 00:02:39.750
If you didn't know any better and you went there,

42
00:02:39.751 --> 00:02:42.210
you'd think that we're starting some sort of a weapons arsenal.

43
00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.380
But all of these things are actually just tools to develop functional,

44
00:02:46.381 --> 00:02:50.930
physical strength.
Um,
if you are into a,
any sort of,
um,

45
00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.980
athletic endeavor,
martial arts,
um,
any,
any sort of sport,
the,

46
00:02:55.981 --> 00:03:00.460
the key to any weightlifting or any strength and conditioning training is

47
00:03:00.461 --> 00:03:05.140
getting your body to move as one unit.
Not isolating specific muscle groups,

48
00:03:05.141 --> 00:03:07.760
but getting the whole body to use,
uh,

49
00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:11.290
all the muscle groups together in conjunction in coordination.

50
00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.350
And that's the kind of equipment that we sell it on on a.com.

51
00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.920

Why fuck around.
Cue The music.

56
00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.590
<v 2>No,
Jamie the Joe.</v>

57
00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.840
<v 0>Well,</v>

58
00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.830
good experience Joe Rogan podcast all day.

59
00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:52.080
<v 2>There are very few men out there in the world that are allowed to be sex</v>

60
00:03:52.081 --> 00:03:56.550
experts.
You sir,
have pulled it off.
I don't know how man pulls that off,

61
00:03:56.551 --> 00:03:58.470
but congratulations to you.
Thank you.

62
00:03:58.471 --> 00:04:01.470
It was an accident and will sometimes that's the best way.

63
00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.460
The only way people write me all the time at my stupid sex advice column saying

64
00:04:05.461 --> 00:04:06.870
they want to be advice columnist when I grew up.

65
00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.260
How do you get the Gig and and can I give them any help?
Or was like,

66
00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.810
well fuck you.
I'm not going to help you compete with me.

67
00:04:12.811 --> 00:04:13.860
It was only a certain number of papers.

68
00:04:13.861 --> 00:04:17.880
You can be syndicated and there's fewer papers than ever because of the Internet

69
00:04:17.881 --> 00:04:19.170
and everything killing in print.

70
00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.090
So what I'm looking to help you start to advice column,

71
00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:25.530
but don't you think that if someone out there had an interesting viewpoint that

72
00:04:25.531 --> 00:04:29.670
perhaps you could maybe benefit from it?
Oh,
absolutely.
I,
I read widely.

73
00:04:29.671 --> 00:04:32.520
I just not in the business of helping people start businesses that compete with

74
00:04:32.521 --> 00:04:36.100
my business.
Isn't that famine thinking?
Isn't that like a little bit,
well,

75
00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.720
everyone in print is of course engage in a lot of famine thinking.
Yeah.

76
00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:43.830
Because it is famine in print right now.
Yeah.
That's um,
that's a hard market.

77
00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:47.010
Unless you're in a place where you absolutely no,
there's no Wifi.

78
00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.933
Like you're in a place,

79
00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.940
a plane going over the Pacific and you don't have an iPad with you,

80
00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:53.400
then you're stuck with print.
You are,

81
00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.740
that might be the only time we have to use print.
Now.

82
00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.800
I was a little upset when they got Wifi on airplanes and I'm old enough to

83
00:04:58.801 --> 00:05:01.320
remember when they didn't have wifi on airplanes because that was,

84
00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:03.600
that had become the one place where I could read a book.

85
00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.410
Why would actually sit and read without reading three lines and checking my

86
00:05:07.411 --> 00:05:10.050
Twitter and reading three lines of checking my Twitter.
For me,
it's writing.

87
00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:11.290
It's one of the features

88
00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:12.510
<v 1>times where I could lock in,</v>

89
00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:16.320
put headphones on and get writing done where I know for sure that I wouldn't

90
00:05:16.321 --> 00:05:20.010
have any interruptions or distractions or couldn't surf the web and we'll check

91
00:05:20.011 --> 00:05:20.810
things out.

92
00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:24.740
<v 2>As a writer,
I write for a living,
I read my column and books and Shit.</v>

93
00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:28.340
I want to find the person who decided it was a really great idea to make the

94
00:05:28.341 --> 00:05:31.430
same thing that I write on the same thing that can deliver me all the

95
00:05:31.431 --> 00:05:35.870
pornography in the world all at once.
But this,
this one devices where you work,

96
00:05:35.871 --> 00:05:37.640
but it's also where all the pornos.
Yeah,

97
00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:40.190
it's like your father's office being under his bed with all the playboy

98
00:05:40.191 --> 00:05:41.660
magazines in the fifties you know,

99
00:05:41.661 --> 00:05:44.630
this is an interesting thing that I wanted to get to because porn in the gay

100
00:05:44.631 --> 00:05:48.350
community is very different than porn in the straight community because porn and

101
00:05:48.351 --> 00:05:53.090
the straight community,
regardless of who you know that does it.

102
00:05:53.091 --> 00:05:56.300
That's a nice person and that claims to love sex.

103
00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:00.980
There's always an of exploitation attached to it.
Where is in the gay community?

104
00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:05.420
I know gay porn stars,
I know guys who,
you know,
like gay porn,

105
00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:06.890
they don't have any problem with it.

106
00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:09.530
It's a completely different sort of a scenario.

107
00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:13.340
Well I know I've known some straight people who were important porn and straight

108
00:06:13.341 --> 00:06:15.830
women who made porn and I know straight women,

109
00:06:15.831 --> 00:06:17.090
sex workers or some friends of mine.

110
00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:20.240
I don't think that those two things necessarily have to be bolted together.

111
00:06:20.241 --> 00:06:23.780
I think they are bundled together and a lot of porn produced for the straight

112
00:06:23.781 --> 00:06:27.080
market because when I see,
when I look at porn made frustrated people,

113
00:06:27.081 --> 00:06:31.080
which I do just to keep abreast,
research,
research,
um,

114
00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:34.520
I see the coupling of desire.
This is what I want to do.

115
00:06:34.521 --> 00:06:37.280
This is the person I would like to do it too with revenge,

116
00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:42.320
with anger and frustration because a lot of porn is made for people who can't

117
00:06:42.321 --> 00:06:46.220
get laid otherwise.
That's a large chunk of the porn market.

118
00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:50.210
And so a lot of corporate producers I think consciously or subconsciously mixed

119
00:06:50.211 --> 00:06:53.180
together like the object of your desire with the punishment.

120
00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:54.980
And I'm not just talking about BDSM porn,

121
00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:58.670
I'm talking about mainstream porn and and vanilla porn,

122
00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:00.860
whether it's this kind of,
you know,

123
00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:05.340
desire a on display that the object of your desire and this anger,

124
00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:07.880
if it gets kind of channeled through at the same time,

125
00:07:07.881 --> 00:07:09.920
cause this person that you want to fuck won't fuck you,

126
00:07:09.921 --> 00:07:12.710
but you can watch them get fucked and watch terrible things happen.

127
00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:16.710
That's interesting cause I don't ever see that kind of porn.
Um,
um,

128
00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:18.920
I know it's out there but I don't run into it.

129
00:07:18.921 --> 00:07:22.510
I don't think it's that Canzo revenge.
How calm.

130
00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:24.920
I mean I think when you talk about that exploitation,

131
00:07:24.921 --> 00:07:26.720
I think that exploitation can also be a part of it.

132
00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:30.020
When you get that creepy sense that what's going on here is a little squeaky and

133
00:07:30.021 --> 00:07:33.950
not very consensual and not coming from a place of joy,
mutual pleasure.

134
00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:36.140
I think that's part of it too.
I think there's a continuum,

135
00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:39.350
but then there's also some people that like that,

136
00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:42.800
that are women like Sasha grey absolutely likes,

137
00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:45.740
you know what she calls being a slut.
Like that's her.

138
00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:49.250
Like she gets to when she has gang bangs,
you know,
and she talks about them.

139
00:07:49.251 --> 00:07:51.320
She likes it,
she likes people abusing her.

140
00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:56.120
Like it's this weird thing and she owns it.
Yeah.
And then it's not abuse.

141
00:07:56.121 --> 00:08:00.590
I mean consent is the magic ingredient that turns anything into something.
Okay.

142
00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:01.461
Yeah.

143
00:08:01.461 --> 00:08:04.340
That's a thing that a lot of you know is there are people out there who only

144
00:08:04.341 --> 00:08:08.090
enjoyed that porn if they don't think the performer enjoys it.
Correct.

145
00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:12.440
If they heard the Sasha grey saying,
I made this,
this turned me on.
I loved it.

146
00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:16.100
It kind of ruins it for a whole class of the porn consumer.

147
00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:18.950
Those people need to die.
Yeah,
I agree.
Yeah.
That's not good.

148
00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:23.180
That's like watching murder films because you really want to murder people,

149
00:08:23.181 --> 00:08:26.420
but you get it out that way.
There's a great essay,
this a gay porn star,

150
00:08:26.421 --> 00:08:26.961
Conner Habib,

151
00:08:26.961 --> 00:08:29.690
you say that like gay people or download with porn and nuts of dump about it,

152
00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:33.260
kind of herb.
He was this gay porn star who wrote this great essay called,

153
00:08:33.261 --> 00:08:37.090
why do you hate porn stars so much?
Because everybody watches porn and,

154
00:08:37.091 --> 00:08:41.510
and he's a gay man and he has gets all this grief from other gay people about

155
00:08:41.511 --> 00:08:42.890
being important about making porn it,

156
00:08:42.891 --> 00:08:47.120
but what he does for a living and the hypocrisy in the culture,

157
00:08:47.121 --> 00:08:50.150
like we hate porn stars,
but we're watching so much fucking porn all the time.

158
00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:52.760
Somebody gets out of porn,
which is what everybody says that you should do.

159
00:08:52.761 --> 00:08:56.210
You shouldn't make porn and tries to go be a lawyer or tries to go be a school

160
00:08:56.211 --> 00:08:56.940
teacher.

161
00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:59.940
And then they're driven out of that profession because of their porn career.

162
00:08:59.941 --> 00:09:01.380
So we say get out of it,

163
00:09:01.381 --> 00:09:02.940
but then we make it possible for people to get out of it.

164
00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:05.190
And that essay is great and it'll,
it'll,
uh,

165
00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:10.050
it gives the lie to the idea that gay people are all across the board better

166
00:09:10.051 --> 00:09:10.621
about porn.

167
00:09:10.621 --> 00:09:12.750
And calmer about porn than straight people are a lot of gay people who have the

168
00:09:12.751 --> 00:09:13.950
same hangups.
Well that's it.

169
00:09:13.951 --> 00:09:18.180
I mean if you're talking about leaving porn and trying to get into any sort of

170
00:09:18.181 --> 00:09:22.200
profession,
you would definitely automatically in some sort of a black list,

171
00:09:22.201 --> 00:09:23.620
right?
Not a blacklist.

172
00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:28.140
You just hope that the thing doesn't surface hope that Google does not perfect

173
00:09:28.141 --> 00:09:32.880
face recognition technology anytime soon.
But if it does,

174
00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:34.890
you're doomed.
You are doomed in a way,

175
00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:39.950
which is really odd because anybody who hasn't done any of the things and you

176
00:09:40.021 --> 00:09:43.350
know,
normal porn,
forget about like bondage,
revenge,
anger,
porn,

177
00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:45.300
but just normal people having sex.

178
00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:50.310
Anyone who hasn't done that is the freak that's there,
the Weirdo.
Increasingly,

179
00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:51.450
we all know we all,

180
00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:54.960
we all have porn production studios in our pockets to carry them everywhere we

181
00:09:54.961 --> 00:09:57.180
go,
everybody,
all of our kids are sexting.

182
00:09:57.330 --> 00:10:00.330
I think there should be an I am Spartacus day where one day a year we all tweet

183
00:10:00.331 --> 00:10:03.960
out a dirty picture of ourselves.
Not for not cause anyone wants to see me naked,

184
00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:09.150
but to protect our children because our children are all sexting right now and

185
00:10:09.151 --> 00:10:12.510
if we continue to live in a world where one dirty picture disqualifies you from

186
00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:14.820
all sorts of careers,
public life,

187
00:10:14.821 --> 00:10:18.360
if it can get you Anthony wiener and then all of our children are going to be

188
00:10:18.361 --> 00:10:21.300
fucked when they grow up because they will all have sent those pictures out

189
00:10:21.301 --> 00:10:24.420
already as teenagers.
That's an interesting point of view.

190
00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:27.480
I'm actually pretty optimistic about the fact that I don't think there's going

191
00:10:27.481 --> 00:10:31.440
to be any secrets whatsoever within the next two decades and so I think it's

192
00:10:31.441 --> 00:10:32.400
going to be a moot point.

193
00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:37.430
I think we're going to expose hypocrisy is going to be exposed on a grand scale

194
00:10:37.531 --> 00:10:40.460
within the next couple of deck because of the digital trail.
Yeah.

195
00:10:40.461 --> 00:10:42.270
I just not just the digital trail,

196
00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:46.410
I think it's going to be like getting to the end of the world and finding the

197
00:10:46.411 --> 00:10:50.280
ocean and just going,
okay,
it's all right here.
Fuck.
It's like,
I don't think,

198
00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:54.600
I think there's going to be no way to hide digital information within the next

199
00:10:54.601 --> 00:10:56.970
10 20 years,
so everything anybody does.

200
00:10:57.300 --> 00:11:00.060
It's like when we were kids and we had questions,

201
00:11:00.061 --> 00:11:04.620
I'm 46 you're 49 w roughly the same age.
When we were kids,

202
00:11:04.621 --> 00:11:08.160
we had questions.
It took a lot of work to find the answer to that question.

203
00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:10.170
You got to go somewhere.
He had to read something.

204
00:11:10.171 --> 00:11:13.590
You had to maybe read a posing sources.
You had to talk to an expert.

205
00:11:13.591 --> 00:11:14.930
It probably maybe didn't need thought though.

206
00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:17.880
That guy wrote that books a fucking idiot and this,
oh,
it was very,

207
00:11:17.881 --> 00:11:18.630
very difficult.

208
00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:22.770
Now you get online and you can find the answers to things within five,

209
00:11:22.771 --> 00:11:23.604
10 seconds.

210
00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:28.910
What we're able to do today was just an alien thought just a few decades ago

211
00:11:29.641 --> 00:11:32.780
when we were kids.
Oh,
within the the the lifespan of my advice,
call me running.

212
00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:35.460
My vice called for 23 years.
For the first decade,

213
00:11:35.461 --> 00:11:39.720
half the questions were,
I call it them definitions,

214
00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:43.560
like what's a butt plug,
but clubs have,
oh,
they have a wiki page.
Now.
If you're,

215
00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:46.350
if you can get out of line to send me an email to ask me what a butt plug is,

216
00:11:46.650 --> 00:11:48.570
you can already have gone to butt plugs,

217
00:11:48.571 --> 00:11:51.690
Wiki page and found out what a butt plug is and how it works.
Yeah,

218
00:11:51.691 --> 00:11:53.100
so many questions that can be avoided today.

219
00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:57.670
So much information is free and I think that that trend,
the trend of the,

220
00:11:57.671 --> 00:11:58.780
the access to information,

221
00:11:58.781 --> 00:12:02.020
it's going to continue and it's going to what we call personal,
you know,
people,

222
00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:06.370
personal privacy,
all these different things.
Those are going to be moot points.

223
00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:09.610
I think we're going to have some sort of a weird hive mind going on when it

224
00:12:09.611 --> 00:12:12.250
comes to information and when that does happen,

225
00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:16.330
the ideas of privacy are going to be very strange.
It's going to be very alien.

226
00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:19.900
Just like the ideas of distribution of information today are very alien to

227
00:12:19.901 --> 00:12:22.900
someone who lived in the Columbus to maybe we're going to have sort of an online

228
00:12:22.901 --> 00:12:26.710
private sphere that's public and accessible in a certain way,
but uh,

229
00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:30.910
sequestered.
There'll be a line between those two identities.

230
00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:35.260
We have this public identity and this private identity or sexual identity and

231
00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:37.330
they're neither.
Both are equally accessible,

232
00:12:37.331 --> 00:12:41.860
but if you take care too schunk what sexual into your sexual online identity and

233
00:12:41.861 --> 00:12:44.110
shut what's professional and your professional online identity,

234
00:12:44.410 --> 00:12:49.000
maybe people will respect that line down and not punish you for it.
Doubt it.
No,

235
00:12:49.001 --> 00:12:52.210
I think that's coming.
Yeah.
Yeah,
I do.
Why do you think that's coming?

236
00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:56.260
I think it's going to be like pod.
You know there was a supreme court nominee,

237
00:12:56.420 --> 00:13:00.640
I think under Reagan has a picture of surfaces and the pod Ginsburg was his
name.

238
00:13:00.641 --> 00:13:02.740
He was smoking pot so he couldn't get beyond the supreme court.

239
00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:06.670
And then you had Clinton who didn't inhale the pod and then you had George Bush

240
00:13:06.671 --> 00:13:10.330
who wouldn't answer the question of how much blow he did and how much pot he

241
00:13:10.331 --> 00:13:14.060
smoked.
And then along comes Obama who was like,
yeah,
I smoked pot and I inhaled.

242
00:13:14.061 --> 00:13:16.990
That was the point.
And it was totally a nonissue.
Right?
And he's coke too.

243
00:13:16.991 --> 00:13:19.320
I think he had no more totally a nonissue.

244
00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:23.140
We're going to get there with sex and sexting and porn.
And online dirty pics.

245
00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:25.450
We'll have our Anthony wiener who's destroyed by it.

246
00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:28.180
We'll have somebody come along and he'll say,
oh,
that's not my Dick.

247
00:13:28.181 --> 00:13:31.480
In that picture,
they,
we'll have somebody come along and say,
yeah,
that's my deck.

248
00:13:31.481 --> 00:13:34.000
It's pretty awesome,
Dick,
both for me,
for president.

249
00:13:34.001 --> 00:13:35.590
And he'll win and it'll be over.

250
00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:39.730
Just like pot is over as an issue that is qualifies you for public life over one

251
00:13:39.731 --> 00:13:42.700
day.
That dirty picture will be a done issue and over.
Well,

252
00:13:42.701 --> 00:13:45.190
I certainly think that the idea of a dirty picture,

253
00:13:45.191 --> 00:13:46.330
it's not going to be a stigma.

254
00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:50.830
The idea of someone who enjoys pornography or any of those things,

255
00:13:50.831 --> 00:13:51.850
it's not going to be a stigma,

256
00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:55.210
but I don't think that people are going to respect any sort of privacy.

257
00:13:55.630 --> 00:13:59.140
I don't think that people are going to respect any sort of differentiation

258
00:13:59.141 --> 00:14:02.660
between your online sex and you're online.
You know,
privately.

259
00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:04.270
I don't think people would respect privacy.

260
00:14:04.271 --> 00:14:06.700
It's not like people won't go look or won't dig,

261
00:14:06.970 --> 00:14:08.470
but I think that people are going to,

262
00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:11.410
people are going to cleave to different identities,
sort of,
uh,

263
00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:14.080
an online identity.
Uh,
sexual identity,

264
00:14:14.290 --> 00:14:16.240
you know who they are when they're looking for it,
who they are,

265
00:14:16.241 --> 00:14:18.880
when they're watching it,
and what they want to do,
who they are.

266
00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:21.530
And that's going to be sort of separate.
You know,

267
00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:23.200
you're going to maintain two public persona.

268
00:14:23.201 --> 00:14:25.990
You're gonna have an online persona that sexualized,
uh,

269
00:14:25.991 --> 00:14:29.140
where you're hunting or looking or fucking or whatever and you're dirty pictures

270
00:14:29.141 --> 00:14:32.140
and your dirty socks and your online persona that's,
you know,

271
00:14:32.141 --> 00:14:34.810
your Facebook page for your mom.
That's interesting.

272
00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:38.200
I think it's too easy to combine things.
They're just,
I don't,

273
00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:42.340
I don't see any way that separate them,
but people do right now.

274
00:14:42.370 --> 00:14:45.430
How do they do it?
Well,
I know people who have,
uh,
you know,
I have friends,

275
00:14:45.450 --> 00:14:48.430
I have a friend who has a Facebook page that's for his mother and his friends

276
00:14:48.431 --> 00:14:51.040
and his professional context.
And then he has this online fetlife,

277
00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:56.180
<v 1>which is just,
you know,
fetlife is this kink site for straight people and it's,</v>

278
00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:59.610
his is super kinky,
straight online life.
Um,

279
00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:01.820
and anybody who knows him knows about both.

280
00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:04.340
And I think his mother probably knows if she went looking,

281
00:15:04.341 --> 00:15:05.300
she could find that other one,

282
00:15:05.301 --> 00:15:07.610
but she's not going to go looking for it because she doesn't want to see it.

283
00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:12.200
Right,
right.
Okay.
Okay.
I see what you're saying.
That's a,
maybe,

284
00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:16.820
maybe you're imagining a much blurrier future than I am are much more tech,

285
00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:21.130
more tech advances.
Yeah.
My future are super blurry futures.

286
00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:24.440
Some crazy hive mind where we're reading each other's minds and living in each

287
00:15:24.441 --> 00:15:26.470
other's lives.
I think that,
you know,

288
00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:30.680
my friend Duncan just got back from this conference on virtual reality and he

289
00:15:30.681 --> 00:15:31.760
saw the newest,
latest,

290
00:15:31.761 --> 00:15:35.990
greatest diversions of Oculus rift and he said it is the most mind blowing thing

291
00:15:35.991 --> 00:15:39.560
he's ever experienced in his lock keyless rift rift is the,
yeah,
the,

292
00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:43.550
the three d reality headsets that you put on,
you put them on and a,

293
00:15:43.551 --> 00:15:47.480
I saw the version which is like one of the first versions and it wasn't that

294
00:15:47.481 --> 00:15:52.190
long ago.
It is pretty cool,
but very pixelated,
very obviously not reality,

295
00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:55.730
but this new one is almost indistinguishable from reality.

296
00:15:55.731 --> 00:15:58.640
You put it on and it looks like you're in a room with a guy playing the piano

297
00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:02.870
and he said it his fucking mind blowing because it's a three degree,

298
00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:08.140
three d dimensional video that what the way they do it is the apparently cover a

299
00:16:08.361 --> 00:16:10.760
person with cameras.
When they filmed this,

300
00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:15.140
they put cameras like all of the person's body and then film the segments so

301
00:16:15.141 --> 00:16:17.720
that the person sees it from a person's point of view,

302
00:16:17.721 --> 00:16:20.900
from a person's perspective and all the possible views.

303
00:16:20.901 --> 00:16:22.970
Like if you turned your head and looked up and looked down,

304
00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:27.050
all those are available.
So,
so when you are inside this,

305
00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:29.900
this virtual world with this headset on and you're looking around,

306
00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:33.530
you see everything as if a person was looking around in that room.

307
00:16:33.530 --> 00:16:36.260
There's no breakup of it.
There's no,

308
00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:40.190
there's no glitch in the matrix where as you're looking around and you go,
oh,

309
00:16:40.191 --> 00:16:40.481
you know,

310
00:16:40.481 --> 00:16:43.430
it can't go that way because they didn't film that way or I can't do this or I

311
00:16:43.431 --> 00:16:45.680
can't do that.
Other point is going to be spectacular.

312
00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:47.780
Everything's going to be spectacular movies.

313
00:16:47.810 --> 00:16:51.260
It's like the idea of sitting in a movie theater and watching some stupid thing

314
00:16:51.261 --> 00:16:55.400
that's being projected onto a screen is going to be as ridiculous as a puppet

315
00:16:55.401 --> 00:16:56.720
show.
That's what I think.

316
00:16:56.721 --> 00:17:00.500
I think that we're going to be involved in some sort of a strange world where

317
00:17:01.070 --> 00:17:04.250
we're this e right now they have to cover people with these cameras,

318
00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:07.250
but I'm sure that as technology increases they'll have a more efficient,

319
00:17:07.251 --> 00:17:11.690
more effective way of handling that sort of a recording of information and we're

320
00:17:11.691 --> 00:17:16.010
going to get to some point where you're going to be able to live someone's life.

321
00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:18.380
Like someone's going to be able to beat Dan savage for a day.

322
00:17:18.381 --> 00:17:20.390
There'll be able to plug in our pity.

323
00:17:20.391 --> 00:17:24.800
The fool puts him to be so exciting as you sit in front of my computer looking

324
00:17:24.801 --> 00:17:28.430
at emails,
well,
there'll be able to read your fucking emails.
That's one thing.

325
00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:31.580
It's going to be very strange.
I don't think there's any way to avoid it.

326
00:17:31.610 --> 00:17:35.940
I think the trend is clearly access to information.
That's the trend.
Um,

327
00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:38.360
and that seems to be what technology is all about.

328
00:17:38.361 --> 00:17:40.820
Technology is all about shortening the amount of distance.

329
00:17:41.030 --> 00:17:45.440
Do you have to go to achieve information tor to access information and I think

330
00:17:45.441 --> 00:17:49.070
that that information is eventually going to become human lives,
human memories,

331
00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:50.090
thoughts and

332
00:17:50.090 --> 00:17:54.960
<v 2>and then eventually being you.
Creepy.
Yeah.</v>

333
00:17:55.110 --> 00:17:56.790
A little.
But then again,

334
00:17:56.791 --> 00:18:01.470
so is the idea of sending a Dick picture across the world like if you lived

335
00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:03.910
5,000 years ago,
no one would be,

336
00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:07.280
they wouldn't even be able to comprehend the idea.
Oh hopefully.
Yeah.

337
00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:11.220
I hope we get there before that you could pocalypse before the seas rise and the

338
00:18:11.221 --> 00:18:12.180
grid collapses.

339
00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:16.470
Because if we don't have a place to plug in our virtual reality reality than we

340
00:18:16.471 --> 00:18:19.830
can't see.
I'm optimistic about that too.
I'm not buying it.

341
00:18:20.010 --> 00:18:22.290
I'm not appealing to me about that.
Why is that?
What do you think?

342
00:18:22.291 --> 00:18:24.450
Because I'm Catholic.
I'm Catholic.

343
00:18:24.490 --> 00:18:29.250
Well I was sorta Catholic are going to be punished.
Uh No,

344
00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:33.060
not a vengeful God.
Its eventual glacier coming for us now.

345
00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:37.530
Do you think that there's some sort of an ECO pocket pocalypse on its way?

346
00:18:38.010 --> 00:18:41.640
You just can't read the paper without,
you know,
the bats are all dying.

347
00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:45.390
We're putting these beads for are exfoliating face scrubs.

348
00:18:45.391 --> 00:18:48.260
These beads are now everywhere in the oceans and the lakes and the rivers

349
00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:52.380
killing everything.
The plastic or the geiers of uh,
or gyres,

350
00:18:52.381 --> 00:18:56.140
however you pronounce that.
Word of garbage in the Pacific and the Atlantic.
Um,

351
00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:59.760
the co two in the atmosphere that we've reached the tipping point with the

352
00:18:59.761 --> 00:19:03.000
Antarctic ice sheets and they're all going to be gone.
It just,

353
00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:08.250
it just feels like we're building up to some sort of eco apocalyptic orgasm.

354
00:19:08.251 --> 00:19:11.700
Like we're edging the planet and edging ourselves and edging humanity and it's

355
00:19:11.701 --> 00:19:16.290
just going to blow.
I think the issue is that people love a good disaster.

356
00:19:16.410 --> 00:19:18.900
And so that's one of the things that everybody likes to talk about.

357
00:19:18.930 --> 00:19:23.430
But if you pay attention to the world history and disasters happen,

358
00:19:23.790 --> 00:19:25.890
like some mother fucker on Easter island was like,

359
00:19:25.891 --> 00:19:29.190
why are you panicking about cutting down the last tree to build another stone

360
00:19:29.191 --> 00:19:32.400
head?
We need to build the stone heads.
And I'm sure there were people like,

361
00:19:32.401 --> 00:19:32.730
you know what?

362
00:19:32.730 --> 00:19:36.210
Maybe we should cut down all the fucking trees cause we're all going to die.

363
00:19:36.211 --> 00:19:39.360
We could.
And they did anyway.
Like societies have committed suicide.
Yeah,

364
00:19:39.361 --> 00:19:40.710
but that's just one little island.

365
00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:45.450
During that time in New York City was built and the Internet was created and how

366
00:19:45.451 --> 00:19:49.890
the earth is an island.
Yeah.
The earth is an island,
but the earth without us,

367
00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:52.050
even without us,
and I'm not a climate change denier,

368
00:19:52.051 --> 00:19:55.170
but even without the human interaction in the earth,

369
00:19:55.171 --> 00:19:57.930
the earth's climate has fluctuated wildly.

370
00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:01.440
10,000 years ago in North America was covered in a mile high sheet of ice.

371
00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:05.200
Most of North America was under ice,
right?
10,000 years ago.
And that sense,

372
00:20:05.201 --> 00:20:08.070
global warming is way better than what nature had.

373
00:20:08.250 --> 00:20:12.870
I had just naturally for us 10,000 years ago perhaps.

374
00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:13.561
But we have never,

375
00:20:13.561 --> 00:20:17.370
we haven't had co two levels like this and the atmosphere for millions of years,

376
00:20:17.371 --> 00:20:22.371
we are engineering a planet that we did not exist on that was not home to our

377
00:20:23.131 --> 00:20:25.530
species,
was not hospitable to mammals.

378
00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:28.530
We don't know what that's gonna look like when the,

379
00:20:29.010 --> 00:20:33.630
when the planet reverts to 10 million years ago,
we just don't know.

380
00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:37.050
And we're gambling with our existence.
Yeah,

381
00:20:37.051 --> 00:20:39.060
we're certainly gambling with our existence.
I mean,

382
00:20:39.090 --> 00:20:41.640
I think more so with the ocean than anything.
The ocean,

383
00:20:41.670 --> 00:20:44.670
just by pulling all the fish out of the ocean and throwing all the garbage in

384
00:20:44.671 --> 00:20:47.470
the ocean,
it's throwing all the CEO's to in the ocean,

385
00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:53.060
<v 3>which is cutting off the bottom of the food chain in the ocean that the,</v>

386
00:20:53.330 --> 00:20:56.740
that's the acidification of the ocean.
It's just I,
you know,

387
00:20:56.741 --> 00:21:00.130
I'm not a climate expert either,
but I tend to believe the scientists,

388
00:21:00.131 --> 00:21:03.820
when scientists are all sort of in agreement that the earth is not indeed flat.

389
00:21:03.821 --> 00:21:05.120
I'm like,
all right,
I will concede the point.

390
00:21:05.150 --> 00:21:07.570
I haven't walked to the edges myself,
but I will concede the point.

391
00:21:08.020 --> 00:21:13.020
And all 97 98% of climate scientists agree that we are baking the planet and we

392
00:21:14.471 --> 00:21:18.850
are gambling with our ability to live on this planet and we don't have another

393
00:21:18.851 --> 00:21:20.640
one.
We don't have a spare well,

394
00:21:20.850 --> 00:21:23.680
and I think we should err on the side of doing away with fossil fuels.

395
00:21:23.681 --> 00:21:26.620
We should err on the side of reengineering our existence and how we exist on

396
00:21:26.621 --> 00:21:30.580
this planet to save our lives are saved the lives of our great,
great,
great,

397
00:21:30.581 --> 00:21:33.940
great grandchildren who are the ones are going to be fucked as opposed to just

398
00:21:33.941 --> 00:21:36.310
hoping that we can keep going the way we're going.

399
00:21:36.310 --> 00:21:41.000
And Sarah paling being Sarah Palin about every goddamn thing we touch.
And

400
00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:45.460
what do you mean?
Oh,
you know,
let's all buy a gun and let's go,

401
00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:49.360
let's consume fossil fuels and climate changes.
Not,
not real.

402
00:21:49.361 --> 00:21:53.170
I think she just epitomizes to me that no,
nothing,
uh,

403
00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:57.610
bullshit that's going to get us all killed.
Right?
Yeah.
I see what you're saying.

404
00:21:57.710 --> 00:22:01.540
Um,
well,
I had a guy on the podcast and Randall Carlson,

405
00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:04.630
who was a fascinating guy who's an expert and not just climate change,

406
00:22:04.631 --> 00:22:08.320
but climate change throughout the history of the earth.
And when you talk to him,

407
00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:13.780
the fears of human created catastrophe diminish and the real fears become

408
00:22:15.611 --> 00:22:16.660
natural catastrophes,

409
00:22:16.661 --> 00:22:20.850
which have existed throughout history like gigantic superforecasters,

410
00:22:21.030 --> 00:22:23.170
asteroidal impacts not just one,

411
00:22:23.171 --> 00:22:27.100
but so many of them throughout history that we're just starting to get an

412
00:22:27.101 --> 00:22:28.150
account.
We have,

413
00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:32.650
we have enough of those to worry about and enough times when nature could reset

414
00:22:32.651 --> 00:22:35.440
the planet,
when an asteroid could hit us and wipe us out,

415
00:22:35.590 --> 00:22:39.820
that we don't need to gin up more of those.
We're basically,

416
00:22:39.850 --> 00:22:41.260
we are the asteroid right now.

417
00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:44.440
We are the asteroid that's hitting the planet that is killing,

418
00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:47.950
that's created the species die off now,
uh,

419
00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:51.310
is as big as the species die off when the asteroid hit the planet.

420
00:22:51.311 --> 00:22:53.530
We are the astrocyte.
Humanity is the asteroid.

421
00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:58.440
And so knowing that there could be a super volcano knowing that a,

422
00:22:58.441 --> 00:23:03.160
an asteroid could hit the planet knowing that some natural catastrophe could

423
00:23:03.161 --> 00:23:05.830
happen,
why create an unnatural catastrophe?

424
00:23:05.870 --> 00:23:09.100
Why don't think anybody's advocating creating an unnatural?
But we are.

425
00:23:09.101 --> 00:23:11.410
What I'm saying is that I think that we're going to be okay.

426
00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:13.570
I think that the human race is going to be okay.

427
00:23:13.571 --> 00:23:15.910
I think that when our backs are up against the wall,

428
00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:20.500
innovation and technology will somehow another fine.
Then you need to say,

429
00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:24.250
let's,
let's all say that our backs are against the wall.
Now let's let,
let's,

430
00:23:24.251 --> 00:23:25.810
let's listen to the scientists who are saying,
hello,

431
00:23:25.811 --> 00:23:26.980
our backs are against the wall.

432
00:23:27.130 --> 00:23:31.060
We're talking about a 100 year or 200 year period.
When you're talking about,

433
00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:31.840
you know,

434
00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:36.800
geological time and talking about the life cycles of a planet is infantile

435
00:23:36.810 --> 00:23:39.910
optimally short.
It seems long to us because of our lifespans,

436
00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:41.710
but with the scientists are telling us,

437
00:23:41.711 --> 00:23:45.620
is this reset we cannot adapt through if it happens at a hundred hundred years,

438
00:23:45.621 --> 00:23:46.010
which is what we're

439
00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:49.130
<v 1>on a pace for.
Well,
I don't think anyone's saying we can't adapt to it.</v>

440
00:23:49.250 --> 00:23:51.050
I don't think they're saying that.
I sang,
we were,

441
00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:52.850
if we're going the way we're going now,

442
00:23:52.851 --> 00:23:55.460
we're going to have serious issues with a lot of the ways we live our lives.

443
00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:57.500
I don't think they're saying we cannot adapt.

444
00:23:57.501 --> 00:23:59.960
I think that would be kind of foolhardy because we certainly could.

445
00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:03.500
Human beings are very flexible.
We've existed through ice ages.
We've existed.

446
00:24:03.530 --> 00:24:07.640
We should start adapting
by having this discussion,

447
00:24:08.140 --> 00:24:10.700
the discussion.
But we're not,
well,
there's dispute online,

448
00:24:10.701 --> 00:24:13.130
but I think that's also because anybody can give an opinion.
I mean,

449
00:24:13.131 --> 00:24:15.110
there's a million people out there that are,
you know,

450
00:24:15.170 --> 00:24:16.880
that have no nothing about climate.

451
00:24:16.881 --> 00:24:20.390
Then insisted it's okay to frack that insisted it's okay to burn coal because we

452
00:24:20.391 --> 00:24:21.730
need the jobs and they assist.

453
00:24:21.790 --> 00:24:25.430
The economy is more important that eventually we'll work this out and then these

454
00:24:25.790 --> 00:24:28.700
sky is falling type people are all just,
you know,

455
00:24:28.730 --> 00:24:31.910
just panicking and we need to just relax and trust the Republicans.
I mean,

456
00:24:31.911 --> 00:24:34.820
there's,
there's a lot of voices out there.
[inaudible] heart of the issue.

457
00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:35.693
Trust God.

458
00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:39.620
Vice did a great piece about climate change in Texas where they went around

459
00:24:39.621 --> 00:24:43.220
interviewing people and nobody believes that the drought and the fires and Texas

460
00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:44.660
have anything to do with climate change.

461
00:24:44.661 --> 00:24:47.600
Whereas 97% of all scientists will tell you this,
everything was climate change.

462
00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:51.110
And they think it's just God fucking with them that if God wants it to rain,

463
00:24:51.111 --> 00:24:54.230
it rains.
And so if it's not raining,
it's not man,
it's not.
I think we did.

464
00:24:54.650 --> 00:24:57.840
It's not altering the climate or disrupting weather patterns.
It's,

465
00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:02.630
it's Jesus is having a sad and so he doesn't want Texas to have rain because

466
00:25:02.631 --> 00:25:04.490
some gay people got married in Boston.

467
00:25:05.630 --> 00:25:08.560
All the part of the adolescent stage of evolution that we're currently in,

468
00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:12.290
I think.
I think that just the issue with people having a voice,

469
00:25:12.291 --> 00:25:14.420
he's a million billion fucking people.

470
00:25:14.690 --> 00:25:17.810
I mean how many Goddamn people are the runners?
7 billion at this point,
right?

471
00:25:18.050 --> 00:25:19.790
350 million in America.

472
00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:23.120
And how many of them have a a fucking Facebook account?

473
00:25:23.121 --> 00:25:24.260
How many of them get on Twitter?

474
00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:29.390
How many of them read a few things from a message board that is some sort of a

475
00:25:29.450 --> 00:25:33.320
pro life pro,
this pro that you know,
God,

476
00:25:33.370 --> 00:25:37.280
Obama's born in Kenya and then they go on and they repeat those things.

477
00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:40.130
You know how many fucking people I've had to have arguments with over chem

478
00:25:40.131 --> 00:25:40.641
trails,

479
00:25:40.641 --> 00:25:44.420
people that believe that the government is spraying things into the sky in order

480
00:25:44.421 --> 00:25:47.090
to create artificial clouds.
It's the most,
I mean,

481
00:25:47.210 --> 00:25:51.650
friends fucking mind numbing conversations and they'll point to a million

482
00:25:51.651 --> 00:25:55.160
different websites written by chimps with a stubby little fingers,

483
00:25:55.161 --> 00:25:58.760
just slam on keyboards and they're convinced that what they're saying is right,

484
00:25:59.060 --> 00:26:03.130
but it's just the amount of voices.
There's just so many voices,
but it's just,

485
00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:07.340
I think we're looking at a brief window where all these voices are being heard

486
00:26:07.341 --> 00:26:09.830
in a strange way where it was never possible before,

487
00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:14.120
but I don't think that we're,
we're looking at is the death of civilization.
Well,

488
00:26:14.121 --> 00:26:18.380
I think we're look at it as where we're becoming aware of the repercussions of

489
00:26:18.381 --> 00:26:19.520
our foolish actions,

490
00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:22.340
but I don't think that necessarily means we're going to all die off.

491
00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:24.980
I think if you look at the way life is right now,

492
00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:27.170
look at life right at this moment.

493
00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:31.310
Best time to live ever by far as far as the history of the world.

494
00:26:31.311 --> 00:26:36.200
Completely agree.
I'm getting better modern dentistry,
medicine scenes.

495
00:26:36.201 --> 00:26:40.250
I will.
Information distribution of information,
access,

496
00:26:40.251 --> 00:26:44.160
Internet communication with each other.
Unprecedented,
better than ever before.

497
00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:47.580
<v 2>I also think compassion,
but that doesn't mean that doesn't mean we're safe,</v>

498
00:26:47.610 --> 00:26:48.780
that it's better now than ever before.

499
00:26:48.781 --> 00:26:52.050
Doesn't mean it can't go completely haywire.
Wrong.

500
00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:55.380
Save her saying safe saying we're going to be okay.

501
00:26:55.590 --> 00:26:56.423
I don't think we're going to be

502
00:26:56.560 --> 00:26:58.300
<v 4>AH,
why?</v>

503
00:26:58.620 --> 00:26:59.140
<v 2>Uh,</v>

504
00:26:59.140 --> 00:27:03.070
because the complacency in your very statement that we're going to be okay is no

505
00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:05.510
complacency induces a kind of passivity.
Maybe not.

506
00:27:05.511 --> 00:27:09.470
You know how you understand what you're saying,
but other people are,

507
00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:13.430
why aren't we all running around with our hair on fire screaming about because

508
00:27:13.431 --> 00:27:16.700
we're existing planet,
but what shouldn't we enjoy our existence?

509
00:27:16.790 --> 00:27:20.510
Shouldn't we enjoy this state that you can enjoy the moments and you can be

510
00:27:20.511 --> 00:27:25.430
concerned for the future existence?
Well,
you can't be,
you can't enjoy it.

511
00:27:25.431 --> 00:27:27.860
If you're saying that we're all gonna die in the sky is falling when

512
00:27:27.861 --> 00:27:29.090
everything's great right now,

513
00:27:30.170 --> 00:27:34.250
we have to be able to game it out into the future and say everything is great

514
00:27:34.251 --> 00:27:36.250
right now.
But looking at the CO2,

515
00:27:36.260 --> 00:27:38.450
looking at what's already happening to the permafrost in Alaska,

516
00:27:38.451 --> 00:27:42.440
looking what's happened to the oceans that we may be living on borrowed time,

517
00:27:42.740 --> 00:27:44.570
that we're going to run out of water.

518
00:27:44.690 --> 00:27:49.690
We're going to run out of a land that can be farmed and we're going to have

519
00:27:50.090 --> 00:27:53.840
hundreds of millions of refugees as coastal areas.

520
00:27:53.841 --> 00:27:58.230
Swamp Miami is already slipping into the water.
There's already rapes.

521
00:27:58.550 --> 00:28:00.950
No,
I know.
That will lead to without Miami.

522
00:28:00.951 --> 00:28:04.100
The only upside of climate change is goodbye Florida.
Right?

523
00:28:04.101 --> 00:28:06.230
We're never gonna have a 10,000 again.

524
00:28:06.410 --> 00:28:09.710
Marco Rubio will be out of the Senate once Florida's off the map.

525
00:28:09.711 --> 00:28:14.000
The real question is what will Nancy grace to for a job in Florida doesn't
exist?

526
00:28:14.510 --> 00:28:19.400
Who will she have to complain about the Florida Twitter man account that's going

527
00:28:19.401 --> 00:28:23.960
to happen in Florida and the Florida man.
Yeah,

528
00:28:23.961 --> 00:28:26.180
account on Twitter.
I miss that.
That's a great account,

529
00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:29.240
but you know what the database the Florida man has already achieved.

530
00:28:29.241 --> 00:28:32.840
You could just go back in history and look at 2003,
four,
five,
six,
seven,
eight,

531
00:28:33.210 --> 00:28:36.080
you'll have plenty of stuff to laughing about it.
We can reengineer Florida.

532
00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:40.310
Florida will become like,
you know,
like back when they used to burn witches,

533
00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:40.791
you know,
you know,

534
00:28:40.791 --> 00:28:43.460
read back in the accounts of the Salem witch trials and you laugh.

535
00:28:43.580 --> 00:28:44.420
That'll be Florida.

536
00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:48.160
He'd be able to just look back at the time when we were half retarded now

537
00:28:48.390 --> 00:28:52.200
Florida,
what was it about Florida?
Where were we thinking?
Bunch of factors.

538
00:28:52.210 --> 00:28:53.840
Humidity is not good for consciousness.

539
00:28:54.310 --> 00:28:56.870
It's a bunch of different things going on down there.
I think too much heat,

540
00:28:57.050 --> 00:29:00.440
too much humidity is very bad for like critical thinking.
That's what I think.

541
00:29:00.630 --> 00:29:03.350
Really.
I don't think it works.
I think you get hot.

542
00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:06.770
You want to go on doors to fucking acs on you start blaming Jesus.

543
00:29:07.190 --> 00:29:08.990
Shit gets weird when it gets really,
really hot.

544
00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:13.850
I have all these relatives who've moved to Phoenix,
Arizona,
Diego,
Tucson,

545
00:29:13.910 --> 00:29:15.510
and it's so funny to talk to them.

546
00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:18.710
They're all from Chicago and they all move there cause uh,
you know,
Chicago,

547
00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:21.920
it's cold.
I think Chicago's grade.
Uh,
I'd rather live in Chicago and in Seattle,

548
00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:25.790
but I go to visit them every once in a while and I'm always like,

549
00:29:25.850 --> 00:29:28.940
because this is such a shit hole.
Phoenix is such a shit hole in Tucson.
Oh,

550
00:29:28.941 --> 00:29:31.970
it's awful.
And I always look at them say,
why do you live here?

551
00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:34.700
And the thing that comes out of their mouths always,

552
00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:38.870
I love the desert and I'm like,
you,
I never fucking in the desert.

553
00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:41.620
You are in your air conditioned house.
You go to your air garage,

554
00:29:41.621 --> 00:29:44.830
you get in your air conditioned car,
you drive to an air conditioned parking lot,

555
00:29:44.831 --> 00:29:46.420
and you go to your air conditioned office.

556
00:29:47.110 --> 00:29:51.040
You live in this air conditioned habit trail.
You're never in the Goddamn desert.

557
00:29:51.550 --> 00:29:54.340
Yeah.
Anybody who loves the desert never goes to the desert.

558
00:29:54.370 --> 00:29:57.490
And if you go to the desert,
you better go in there and fucking winter.
Okay,

559
00:29:57.710 --> 00:30:01.930
go there in the summer,
you can die outside in a couple of hours.
Just wandering.

560
00:30:01.931 --> 00:30:06.210
I know a guy died in the desert.
Evan Tanner for me.
UFC fighter.
Oh yeah.

561
00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:09.100
He was a former UFC champion.
He was a a wonder lust,

562
00:30:09.101 --> 00:30:12.610
sort of a guy who liked to walk in the desert one for a long,

563
00:30:12.780 --> 00:30:15.630
he was one of those vision quest type characters.
Wanted to,
you know,

564
00:30:15.790 --> 00:30:20.790
go on treks to find himself and to be alone in nature and decided to go on this

565
00:30:21.191 --> 00:30:24.760
thing in the desert and got disoriented.
Couldn't find his camp losses.

566
00:30:24.761 --> 00:30:29.140
Water died.
Yeah,
it's fucked.
But that's the desert.

567
00:30:29.141 --> 00:30:31.900
That's the real desert.
That's not God Damn Phoenix parking lot.

568
00:30:32.140 --> 00:30:36.400
You know that's not a fucking mall in Scottsdale.
I love the desert pitch.

569
00:30:36.401 --> 00:30:39.700
You are not in the desert.
The desert eating fro Yo,

570
00:30:39.790 --> 00:30:43.780
that desert is a horse climate with have Aleena's and fucking poisonous snakes

571
00:30:43.781 --> 00:30:47.530
and Scorpions and shit.
That's the real desert.
It's a fucking rough world.

572
00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:50.240
But Phoenix is,
that's why I like Chicago winter.
Why?

573
00:30:50.470 --> 00:30:53.500
But you like Chicago so much.
Why do you like Chicago?
Cause it's not the desert.

574
00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:56.260
It's cold as fuck in the winter though,
man.

575
00:30:56.390 --> 00:30:59.160
It makes you appreciate it the summer.
And I agree with that.
It's a,

576
00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:03.370
I live in Seattle where winter means it's 40 degrees and pouring rain.

577
00:31:03.670 --> 00:31:07.510
So you're always sopping wet.
Chicago,
even when it's like 10 below,

578
00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:10.450
you're dry and you dress for it,
you're dry.

579
00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:14.800
And I think you're colder after a in 40 degrees soaking wet for six months.

580
00:31:14.801 --> 00:31:18.180
Then you are in Chicago when it's 10 below for a couple of weeks.
Man.
I Dunno.

581
00:31:18.190 --> 00:31:22.150
I think if you live in Chicago you might,
you might reassess that up in Chicago.

582
00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:24.410
In Chicago.
Yeah.
Okay.
Well,
I don't know man.

583
00:31:24.850 --> 00:31:27.220
Chicago's we're fucking brutal in the winter.
I love it there though.

584
00:31:27.221 --> 00:31:29.470
It's great town,
but it is a great town.
Feel a smart,

585
00:31:29.471 --> 00:31:32.920
cool people that have this weird Midwest thing going on.
Like good folks.

586
00:31:33.090 --> 00:31:35.440
They have like this,
they're like intelligent worldly,

587
00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:38.470
but they also have this sort of Midwest good folk thing going on that they don't

588
00:31:38.471 --> 00:31:43.471
have the New York side and apartments can be had for less than the cost of two

589
00:31:43.481 --> 00:31:47.680
kidneys.
Right.
As opposed to New York.
Yeah.
New York is pretty ridiculous.

590
00:31:47.950 --> 00:31:50.980
But Chicago's got some serious issues with crime and violence to,

591
00:31:50.981 --> 00:31:55.870
especially amongst black people.
The south side.
Yeah.
Unbelievable.
And,
uh,

592
00:31:55.871 --> 00:31:56.950
when I was there,
um,

593
00:31:57.160 --> 00:32:00.430
one of the guys who drove us around was a former cop and gave us some insight on

594
00:32:00.431 --> 00:32:03.340
all of it and he said,
well,
it's like a power struggle thing.

595
00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:05.860
They arrested a bunch of gang members thinking they were going to clean up the

596
00:32:05.861 --> 00:32:10.090
situation and they only opened up a void that is being,
you know,

597
00:32:10.091 --> 00:32:13.990
that they're battling to fill that they put these guys away and when they put

598
00:32:13.991 --> 00:32:17.830
these guys away than other people were just trying to fight to battle to see who

599
00:32:17.831 --> 00:32:19.930
takes the top position.
And growing up in Chicago,

600
00:32:19.931 --> 00:32:21.370
the attitude was when I was a kid,

601
00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:25.030
so long as the violence is contained to the south side,

602
00:32:25.031 --> 00:32:27.400
so long as the violence is only hurting people of color,

603
00:32:27.430 --> 00:32:31.120
it's not an issue for the city.
See,
I think I was just going to be an apocalypse.

604
00:32:31.121 --> 00:32:34.540
It's going to be an apocalypse because of our attitude about four people.

605
00:32:34.810 --> 00:32:36.940
It's about poor people are attitudes about poor people,

606
00:32:36.941 --> 00:32:40.030
I think are the most shameful [inaudible]

607
00:32:40.150 --> 00:32:44.600
<v 1>and depressing aspects of modern society and culture that we're constantly</v>

608
00:32:44.660 --> 00:32:46.220
concerned with dealing with.

609
00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:50.210
All these different things that are going on overseas and worrying about all

610
00:32:50.211 --> 00:32:53.330
these,
the these different things that are happening in other countries and

611
00:32:53.630 --> 00:32:55.790
accumulating natural resources and other countries.

612
00:32:55.791 --> 00:32:59.150
But the number one resource that human beings have is humans,

613
00:32:59.510 --> 00:33:00.740
human innovation and people.

614
00:33:00.890 --> 00:33:03.560
And I've always said that if people were really concerned with strengthening

615
00:33:03.561 --> 00:33:04.041
America,

616
00:33:04.041 --> 00:33:07.490
the number one way to strengthen America is in make it so there's less losers,

617
00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:08.990
right?
Well,
how do you do that?

618
00:33:08.991 --> 00:33:11.810
You help out people that are disenfranchised and you help out people that have

619
00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:15.680
been dealt the shitty hand in life,
being born in a poor neighborhood,

620
00:33:15.710 --> 00:33:17.720
being born with no access to information,

621
00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:22.090
<v 3>preschool,
uh,
violence,
crime.
It's,
it's that,</v>

622
00:33:22.091 --> 00:33:24.130
it's that puritanical streak in American culture.

623
00:33:24.131 --> 00:33:26.950
There is this thing that goes back to the very founding of the country that if

624
00:33:26.951 --> 00:33:30.490
somebody is disadvantaged,
that they're divinely disadvantaged,

625
00:33:30.820 --> 00:33:32.290
that God doesn't favor them.

626
00:33:32.291 --> 00:33:36.050
They sort of being punished by God and by fate or whatever.
And the,
the,
our,

627
00:33:36.060 --> 00:33:39.220
our society reflects that.
We treat people who are poor,
like shit.
We,

628
00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:40.540
we continue to punish them.

629
00:33:40.541 --> 00:33:45.410
We do everything we can possibly to make it worse for them.
And it's uh,

630
00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:48.880
Paul Lang and it is so anti Christian.

631
00:33:48.881 --> 00:33:52.000
It is so vicious.
I mean,
you look at the way,
uh,

632
00:33:52.001 --> 00:33:55.540
even people who are imprisoned are screwed when they have to make a phone call

633
00:33:55.541 --> 00:33:59.100
home.
It's some outrageous,
they get paid pennies to work in the,
you know,

634
00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:01.840
some shit job in prison and then to make a phone call,

635
00:34:01.841 --> 00:34:05.170
it's going to cost them two and a half bucks a minute to call their kid and talk

636
00:34:05.171 --> 00:34:06.550
for five seconds.
And we,

637
00:34:06.910 --> 00:34:11.740
we severed that relationship between incarcerated parent and child to the damage

638
00:34:11.741 --> 00:34:14.710
that child and perpetuate that,
that system.

639
00:34:15.150 --> 00:34:18.180
<v 1>Do you think that it's a puritanical thing or do you think it's a human nature</v>

640
00:34:18.181 --> 00:34:21.840
thing that people who already are in a good position don't want to help someone

641
00:34:21.841 --> 00:34:23.010
who's not in a good position?

642
00:34:23.590 --> 00:34:27.040
<v 3>I don't think you see it as a,
I mean there are certainly other societies,</v>

643
00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:28.233
other cultures,

644
00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:32.470
other countries with huge disparities in income.

645
00:34:32.890 --> 00:34:34.960
But I don't think in western industrialized countries,

646
00:34:34.961 --> 00:34:38.440
you see it quite as starkly as you see it in the United States.

647
00:34:38.680 --> 00:34:42.100
We have socialism for cars.

648
00:34:42.510 --> 00:34:46.580
We totally subsidized roads.
We have socialism for airports.
Um,

649
00:34:46.630 --> 00:34:50.410
but we don't have socialism for children and families and people who need

650
00:34:50.411 --> 00:34:54.880
healthcare and people who need access to a decent food and decent housing.

651
00:34:54.881 --> 00:34:58.030
We Bat,
we can socialize every other goddamn thing.
Socialize.

652
00:34:58.120 --> 00:35:00.550
<v 1>Yeah.
I think that's because everyone needs the roads.</v>

653
00:35:00.551 --> 00:35:02.230
Everyone needs the airports.

654
00:35:02.231 --> 00:35:05.230
But you look at the people that everyone more and if you are not poor and you

655
00:35:05.231 --> 00:35:08.050
don't care about them,
you know,
I am concentrating them on myself.

656
00:35:08.290 --> 00:35:10.960
I'm worried about me.
I'm worried about getting my own thing.
I mean,

657
00:35:10.961 --> 00:35:12.520
isn't that kind of the same thing is like,

658
00:35:12.580 --> 00:35:16.390
<v 3>but you have to share a world with,
you have to share a culture,
a city.
Um,</v>

659
00:35:16.660 --> 00:35:20.920
there's only so long a society can be in denial about the fact that we're all in

660
00:35:20.921 --> 00:35:24.100
this together and there will be blow back if people,

661
00:35:24.130 --> 00:35:26.810
the violence on the south side of Chicago,
um,

662
00:35:26.830 --> 00:35:30.100
gang violence doesn't just claim gang members as victims.

663
00:35:30.270 --> 00:35:34.870
It's spills out eventually and it will impact you whether you like it or not.

664
00:35:34.871 --> 00:35:38.070
And there's only so many,
uh,
gated communicate

665
00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:43.100
<v 1>communities that you can hide in before the shit that you've been dealing out to</v>

666
00:35:43.171 --> 00:35:46.070
others or the culture,
the Sada societies with dealing with this,
uh,

667
00:35:46.290 --> 00:35:48.540
comes for you to,
yeah,
no question about that.

668
00:35:48.541 --> 00:35:50.900
I just wonder if the reason why we have this,
uh,

669
00:35:51.750 --> 00:35:56.130
this need to socialize things like roads and airports,

670
00:35:56.131 --> 00:35:59.220
but yet we don't concern ourselves with the people that are poor.

671
00:35:59.221 --> 00:36:00.630
It's just that we don't have to,

672
00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:04.350
it's just like the same sort of a thing where if you're doing well and you're

673
00:36:04.351 --> 00:36:08.310
doing well in life,
like,
Hey,
I'm concentrating on me,
I'm going to push forward.

674
00:36:08.430 --> 00:36:10.920
And then we have that convenient thing that a lot of people love to do.

675
00:36:10.921 --> 00:36:13.530
That's really kind of disgusting where they,
they go,
hey,
you know,

676
00:36:13.531 --> 00:36:15.990
a lot of people were born in poor neighborhoods and they make it,
you know,

677
00:36:15.991 --> 00:36:18.350
I was born in a poor neighborhood and I did this and I did that.

678
00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:21.760
I always called that argument.
The 90 year old smoker.
Oh yeah.

679
00:36:21.770 --> 00:36:25.230
My grandfather smoked and lived to be 90 therefore it's not a carcinogen.

680
00:36:25.231 --> 00:36:27.630
Like I know somebody who is poor who totally got it.

681
00:36:27.990 --> 00:36:31.730
I got up so anybody can do it because that person can do it.
There.

682
00:36:31.731 --> 00:36:35.640
There are structural disadvantages that consigned millions of people to poverty

683
00:36:35.820 --> 00:36:40.620
with no hope of escape because you know one data 0.9 year old smoker who got

684
00:36:40.621 --> 00:36:41.190
out.
Yeah.

685
00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:44.860
That pull yourself up by your bootstraps argument is a really rough one because

686
00:36:44.861 --> 00:36:48.490
there's some people that are born and they're so fucked up mentally by the time

687
00:36:48.500 --> 00:36:50.610
they get to be well,
not only that,

688
00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:55.830
just the psychology of of survival and dealing with a horrible neighborhood,

689
00:36:55.831 --> 00:36:58.080
abusive family,
all the different things that you have to deal with.

690
00:36:58.081 --> 00:37:02.640
If you're in a crime,
Britain environment,
by the time you get to 18,
19,

691
00:37:02.641 --> 00:37:06.820
when you're an adult quote unquote,
you're so fucked up and you,

692
00:37:06.821 --> 00:37:08.310
you have so much to deal with.

693
00:37:08.310 --> 00:37:11.170
The idea that there's the only difference between you and someone else's

694
00:37:11.220 --> 00:37:16.220
education and a job is preposterous because it's just the development as a human

695
00:37:16.591 --> 00:37:17.850
being,
your,
your actual,

696
00:37:18.210 --> 00:37:22.930
the structure of your mind of your psychology is so compromised by all the

697
00:37:23.020 --> 00:37:25.830
things that you have.
It's a stress warps.
Mines.

698
00:37:25.831 --> 00:37:29.130
And we have created a society that is built on stress,
economically,

699
00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:32.700
epigenetic stress,
more warps minds in the womb.
You know,

700
00:37:32.701 --> 00:37:36.060
they've shown that women who are really stressed out and in bad environments,

701
00:37:36.061 --> 00:37:39.330
they developed children that have hair triggers.
You know,

702
00:37:39.331 --> 00:37:42.730
I talked to Michael Irvin,
you know,
Michael Irvin,
the football player.
He uh,

703
00:37:42.750 --> 00:37:47.750
works with a lot of disadvantaged kids and children that have problems with

704
00:37:47.911 --> 00:37:51.840
violence and you know,
and giving them tools and uh,

705
00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:56.310
you just coping mechanisms and what he was talking to me,

706
00:37:56.311 --> 00:38:00.270
but we shared a long flight once to Sydney,
just by random luck.

707
00:38:00.270 --> 00:38:03.170
He was on the same flight as me and we had a long conversation about it and it

708
00:38:03.171 --> 00:38:07.170
was talking about how few people realize that the actual development of their

709
00:38:07.171 --> 00:38:11.040
mind is different from the jump just because their mother grew up in a horrible

710
00:38:11.041 --> 00:38:15.060
environment just cause they were being born and prepared for this environment of

711
00:38:15.061 --> 00:38:16.620
incredible stress and danger.

712
00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:20.280
And the idea that such a pull yourself up by your bootstraps,

713
00:38:20.281 --> 00:38:23.700
what you need to do is just,
you know,
you've got to get it,
get an education.

714
00:38:23.701 --> 00:38:27.690
You can go online and get an education with MIT like,
Oh fucking Christ man.

715
00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:28.560
It's not that easy.

716
00:38:28.620 --> 00:38:31.620
A few things we could do right off the bat to relieve all that kind of stress,

717
00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:36.040
uh,
socialized medicine for all and not Obamacare.
Obamacare

718
00:38:36.670 --> 00:38:40.120
<v 3>is less evil than the system we had before,
but it's still kind of evil.</v>

719
00:38:40.121 --> 00:38:43.050
It's still going to leave millions of people uninsured.
Um,

720
00:38:43.210 --> 00:38:46.260
17,000 people a year roughly are going to die,
uh,

721
00:38:46.270 --> 00:38:50.770
under Obamacare because they don't have insurance leaves people uninsured,
um,

722
00:38:50.830 --> 00:38:55.630
leaves people behind.
It's not universal,
the guaranteed minimum income.

723
00:38:55.780 --> 00:38:57.880
All of these programs we have to address poverty.

724
00:38:57.881 --> 00:38:59.830
We could bundle them all together,
eliminate them,

725
00:38:59.831 --> 00:39:01.930
and give people all guaranteed minimum income,

726
00:39:02.140 --> 00:39:06.340
which was a proposal that Richard Nixon made in the late sixties,

727
00:39:06.610 --> 00:39:07.390
early seventies.

728
00:39:07.390 --> 00:39:11.350
Guaranteed minimum income was so radical and socialist that a republican

729
00:39:11.351 --> 00:39:15.010
president was talking about enacting it.
And just those two things,

730
00:39:15.011 --> 00:39:17.850
absent a strong labor movement,
absent,
um,

731
00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:22.060
decent jobs like those two things taken together would relieve a whole lot of

732
00:39:22.061 --> 00:39:24.280
stress for a whole lot of working people and poor people.

733
00:39:24.580 --> 00:39:26.370
And we'd have fewer kids born,
uh,

734
00:39:26.530 --> 00:39:29.290
with those a hair trigger brains you're talking about?

735
00:39:29.330 --> 00:39:33.440
<v 1>Yeah,
the guaranteed minimums income.
I see the arguments against it.</v>

736
00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:35.120
I see what they're saying.

737
00:39:35.390 --> 00:39:37.990
It's like they're worried that people get lazy and that people are just going to

738
00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:40.130
take that minimum income and they're just gonna,
you know,

739
00:39:40.131 --> 00:39:41.100
and they're not going to work hard.
Right.

740
00:39:41.340 --> 00:39:44.940
<v 3>Somebody gave you $75,000 a year.
Not that that would be the minimum income,</v>

741
00:39:44.941 --> 00:39:48.510
but if you had a whole 75 k lying around,
would you stop doing shit?

742
00:39:48.790 --> 00:39:51.670
<v 1>Some people would,
but doesn't.
Yeah,
I know people,</v>

743
00:39:51.700 --> 00:39:54.700
I've had people that worked for me who are lazy as fuck because they ended up

744
00:39:55.270 --> 00:39:58.570
guaranteed income.
So I see the human nature aspect of it.

745
00:39:58.870 --> 00:40:03.010
But the reality is like saying that the minimum wage shouldn't be $15 an hour.

746
00:40:03.070 --> 00:40:07.540
Well it's asking someone to work for a fucking hour and only giving them $15 is

747
00:40:07.541 --> 00:40:10.510
ridiculous.
And when you own something like Mcdonald's,

748
00:40:10.511 --> 00:40:15.511
some gigantic multibillion dollar dollar corporation or even a franchise of a

749
00:40:15.671 --> 00:40:17.200
multibillion dollar corporation,

750
00:40:17.470 --> 00:40:22.210
the idea that that resource of a human being working for you is not worth $15 in

751
00:40:22.211 --> 00:40:25.270
an hour when you're not making efficient use of that person then.

752
00:40:25.470 --> 00:40:26.400
<v 3>Well,
the,
the whole,</v>

753
00:40:27.450 --> 00:40:30.480
the problem with when we talk about minimum wage workers in fast food

754
00:40:30.481 --> 00:40:35.400
establishments is we've gotten it into our heads somehow because of corporate

755
00:40:35.401 --> 00:40:35.821
media.

756
00:40:35.821 --> 00:40:39.900
I think because of the way we write about the labor movement or labor markets or

757
00:40:39.901 --> 00:40:42.890
capital got,
it doesn't usually,
not my,
what I talk about and,

758
00:40:42.970 --> 00:40:44.310
but I'd love to talk about it.
Um,

759
00:40:44.670 --> 00:40:48.240
we've got into our heads that the guy who owns the Mcdonald's is giving that

760
00:40:48.241 --> 00:40:52.920
person a job,
is doing that person a favor,
that they're lucky to have a job,

761
00:40:53.100 --> 00:40:56.550
that they shouldn't look at their employer with anything but gratitude as if

762
00:40:56.551 --> 00:41:01.551
their serfs is it this feudalism as opposed to that laborer is creating the

763
00:41:01.801 --> 00:41:06.480
wealth.
That laborer is creating wealth for the,
for the Mcdonald's corporation,

764
00:41:06.481 --> 00:41:07.440
for all of its shareholders.

765
00:41:07.590 --> 00:41:12.240
And that Labor isn't just an employee who the corporation is doing a favor by

766
00:41:12.241 --> 00:41:13.074
giving you a job.

767
00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:17.760
That person creates wealth for the shareholders and has a claim,

768
00:41:17.761 --> 00:41:22.761
a legitimate claim to a share of that wealth and a living wage share of that

769
00:41:24.031 --> 00:41:26.820
wealth.
And when you look at Mcdonald's like billions of dollars of profit,

770
00:41:26.821 --> 00:41:30.960
I did this on the back of a Napkin once just googling around Mcdonald with its

771
00:41:30.961 --> 00:41:34.160
employees in the United States.
It means $7 billion

772
00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:35.270
<v 2>in profit last year.</v>

773
00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:39.620
They could pay each one of their employees and extra 15 or 20 k a year just by

774
00:41:39.770 --> 00:41:44.390
returning $6 billion in profit to their shareholders one year instead of $7

775
00:41:44.390 --> 00:41:48.980
billion that maybe a billion of that 7 billion rightfully belongs to Mcdonald's

776
00:41:48.981 --> 00:41:51.790
employees that generated that wealth in the first place and not just to

777
00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:55.490
Mcdonald's shareholders.
Why can't we have that conversation?
Well,

778
00:41:55.491 --> 00:41:58.960
it's a good conversation for sure.
I think the the,
you know,
why did we,

779
00:41:59.060 --> 00:42:03.140
the elements,
there's a lot of elements to what a human does when they work for,

780
00:42:03.350 --> 00:42:07.770
I mean if you have a gigantic corporations is there's a huge,
it's a,

781
00:42:08.180 --> 00:42:12.680
it's a huge thing with a lot of moving pieces and the moving pieces.

782
00:42:12.860 --> 00:42:16.180
The organic moving piece since are human beings and some of the organic movement

783
00:42:16.181 --> 00:42:20.390
pieces are CEOs and some of them are managers and there's this hierarchy as far

784
00:42:20.391 --> 00:42:24.470
as like funds,
but when it gets down to the,
the,
the workers that are introduced,

785
00:42:24.471 --> 00:42:24.611
the,

786
00:42:24.611 --> 00:42:28.100
the bottom line people that come in and they fill out an application and they

787
00:42:28.101 --> 00:42:31.910
need a job.
The idea that paying them $15 an hour is outrageous.

788
00:42:31.970 --> 00:42:35.690
It's fucking crazy.
Like what,
how do you expect these people to feed themselves?

789
00:42:35.810 --> 00:42:39.440
How to expect these people to pay for food,
pay for housing.

790
00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:42.230
You can't do that on less than $15 an hour.

791
00:42:42.380 --> 00:42:44.640
You can barely do that on $15 an hour.

792
00:42:44.740 --> 00:42:47.770
Part of the problem is the people who comment the,

793
00:42:47.820 --> 00:42:52.170
the politicians are in their sixties and seventies,
most of them 50s and up,
um,

794
00:42:52.280 --> 00:42:55.700
for their generation.
Those were jobs you had as teenagers.

795
00:42:55.850 --> 00:42:59.720
Those were jobs that nobody worked in for years and years.
They weren't a job.

796
00:42:59.750 --> 00:43:02.510
That wasn't a job working at Mcdonald's at an adult with the child had.

797
00:43:02.780 --> 00:43:06.530
And everything has changed in the last 30 or 40 years since policymakers,

798
00:43:06.531 --> 00:43:10.210
pundits,
people who edit newspapers were in the law,
that kind of,

799
00:43:10.220 --> 00:43:13.460
that at that end of the labor market when they were just getting started.

800
00:43:13.670 --> 00:43:16.310
So they have this attitude that this is not,
this doesn't,

801
00:43:16.430 --> 00:43:19.550
this isn't supposed to be a living wage job because working at Mcdonald's is,

802
00:43:19.551 --> 00:43:23.730
and something that an adult does all their lives in our new economy.
Uh,
you know,

803
00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:28.520
Jay with nothing but shitty jobs available for people with college degrees,

804
00:43:28.521 --> 00:43:29.360
working at Mcdonald's,

805
00:43:29.361 --> 00:43:33.110
people with kids turns their families were getting the titles that $15 an hour

806
00:43:33.111 --> 00:43:36.810
or up is completely justified.
And you know,

807
00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:40.160
we used to like let people,
we used to pay a living wage,

808
00:43:40.190 --> 00:43:44.510
a middle class wage to people who stood on assembly lines making cars doing the

809
00:43:44.511 --> 00:43:47.630
same small action over and over again as the car moved on the assembly line.

810
00:43:47.990 --> 00:43:51.710
And we say,
well,
here's an assembly line for Hamburgers for food.

811
00:43:52.040 --> 00:43:55.310
Why should that person's labor be valued less?

812
00:43:55.450 --> 00:43:59.600
And the Labor of the person working on a similar assembly line making a car?

813
00:43:59.660 --> 00:44:01.230
Yeah.
Oh absolutely.
And the,

814
00:44:01.231 --> 00:44:05.330
the idea that this shouldn't be a job that an adult has,
where the fuck are you?

815
00:44:05.660 --> 00:44:06.493
You know,
it's a job.

816
00:44:06.610 --> 00:44:10.430
W W who the fuck are you to say that this is isn't a job that someone should

817
00:44:10.431 --> 00:44:14.240
have to support themselves?
This is an entry level.
The only job,
the,
you know,

818
00:44:14.241 --> 00:44:16.940
we're talking about the economic revival.
We're talking about the recovery.

819
00:44:16.941 --> 00:44:20.120
Most of the jobs that have been created are shitty minimum wage jobs with no

820
00:44:20.330 --> 00:44:22.400
health insurance,
no pension plans,
nothing.

821
00:44:22.910 --> 00:44:25.730
We have to make these jobs better if we're going to exist in an economy where

822
00:44:25.731 --> 00:44:29.270
it's just people making hamburgers for each other and passing them around or

823
00:44:29.271 --> 00:44:31.980
making drinks for each other a service we have to make

824
00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:35.640
<v 3>the service economy,
jobs,
living wage,
even middle class jobs.</v>

825
00:44:36.060 --> 00:44:37.650
We have to transform our economy.

826
00:44:37.730 --> 00:44:40.370
<v 1>Yeah,
no,
no argument there at all.
I think,
uh,</v>

827
00:44:40.910 --> 00:44:45.860
just compassion and generosity are two things that if you found out that a

828
00:44:45.861 --> 00:44:49.030
corporation had and another corporation opposing corporational,

829
00:44:49.031 --> 00:44:53.870
he could say if Wendy's proved to be super compassionate and generous and they,

830
00:44:54.090 --> 00:44:56.600
they did that all the time when they support and then across the street was a

831
00:44:56.601 --> 00:45:00.140
Mcdonald's who was doing the opposite.
I would always go to Wendy's.

832
00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:01.670
I would go there right away.
I mean,

833
00:45:01.671 --> 00:45:04.940
I would try to vote with my dollar if that was the situation.

834
00:45:05.270 --> 00:45:10.010
I think if we find out who would do that.
So it needs to be the law.

835
00:45:10.520 --> 00:45:11.061
Yeah.
Well,

836
00:45:11.061 --> 00:45:14.150
I'm not saying that it only should be because people are compassionate,

837
00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:18.290
but I think that there's not enough people that do it.

838
00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:22.880
But I think if more people knew the benefits of that,
they probably would.

839
00:45:23.210 --> 00:45:25.010
I think if more people were aware,

840
00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:28.370
and I think more people are socially aware now than ever before.

841
00:45:28.670 --> 00:45:30.260
I think more people are,
I mean,

842
00:45:30.261 --> 00:45:34.130
just look at what people are getting in trouble for today that they would never

843
00:45:34.131 --> 00:45:36.330
get in trouble for before socially.
Like we,

844
00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:38.840
this Donald Sterling thing is a perfect example.

845
00:45:39.170 --> 00:45:42.440
Guy Says he doesn't want his girlfriend to take pictures with black people.

846
00:45:42.470 --> 00:45:45.950
That's it.
Fine if she fucks him.
Yeah,
fine.
And everybody,
by the way,

847
00:45:45.951 --> 00:45:49.160
conveniently ignores that aspect of the conversation.
I do.

848
00:45:49.370 --> 00:45:51.260
That's all I wrote about.
If it was the opposite,

849
00:45:51.530 --> 00:45:54.320
imagine if anybody had a problem with that.
If you said,
hey listen,

850
00:45:54.321 --> 00:45:56.750
you could take pictures of black people or you want,
just don't fuck them.

851
00:45:57.470 --> 00:45:58.880
No one's saying anything.
They'd be like,
well,

852
00:45:58.881 --> 00:46:02.600
this is an unfortunate conversation that was captured on video or recording,

853
00:46:02.601 --> 00:46:07.370
whether,
you know,
between some sad man and his girlfriend,
old man,

854
00:46:07.430 --> 00:46:10.010
old man with it,
turns out Alzheimer's.
Now he's got,
you know,

855
00:46:10.011 --> 00:46:12.870
they've diagnosed him with Alzheimer's.
He's an old fuck,
he's 82 years old.

856
00:46:12.890 --> 00:46:16.040
The nobody rides for free.
You know,
this meat wagon that you're on,

857
00:46:16.041 --> 00:46:17.240
it's eventually going to fall apart.

858
00:46:17.570 --> 00:46:19.640
And when you're 82 begging to fuck some 20 year old,

859
00:46:19.650 --> 00:46:22.610
you've got a buyer for robberies and Bentley's and you've got to ask her not to

860
00:46:22.611 --> 00:46:24.920
take patients with black people because you're,
you're falling apart.
You know,

861
00:46:24.921 --> 00:46:29.810
he's an old dude.
But the outrage and the,
the movement against him and you know,

862
00:46:29.811 --> 00:46:31.550
and a lot of it's posturing.

863
00:46:31.730 --> 00:46:34.910
The NBA finding him two and a half million dollars,

864
00:46:34.911 --> 00:46:38.450
the highest amount banning him for life because he doesn't want his girlfriend

865
00:46:38.451 --> 00:46:42.110
taking pictures of black people.
It's fucking preposterous.
It's all ridiculous.

866
00:46:42.140 --> 00:46:45.410
But what I like about it is a stand,
it's a stand,

867
00:46:45.710 --> 00:46:49.760
a stand about the accepted social realities of our world today.

868
00:46:49.960 --> 00:46:53.960
And that we can communicate that we don't like racism in a way that's never been

869
00:46:54.140 --> 00:46:54.870
able to,

870
00:46:54.870 --> 00:46:58.590
<v 3>we communicate that we don't like racism and then we say we have solved racism</v>

871
00:46:58.591 --> 00:47:02.160
because we drove Donald sterling out of the NBA.
Meanwhile,

872
00:47:02.460 --> 00:47:07.460
we don't address the social inequities that are with the racism so deeply

873
00:47:09.031 --> 00:47:12.540
encoded into,
uh,
our society,
our politics,

874
00:47:12.840 --> 00:47:15.180
like we've solved the Donald Sterling problem.

875
00:47:15.181 --> 00:47:18.150
What about all these African American kids trapped in Shitty,
Shitty,

876
00:47:18.151 --> 00:47:19.980
shitty schools on the south side of Chicago?

877
00:47:20.190 --> 00:47:24.510
What about efforts to disenfranchise millions of people of Color and young

878
00:47:24.511 --> 00:47:27.840
people,
uh,
efforts being led by Republicans?

879
00:47:27.841 --> 00:47:31.840
It's almost as if the Donald Sterling freak out and all this desire to pay

880
00:47:31.841 --> 00:47:36.841
attention to it and then take satisfaction from the resolution of it is to just

881
00:47:37.060 --> 00:47:41.770
meant to distract us or in a way functions to distract us from the systemic

882
00:47:41.830 --> 00:47:43.630
racism that still plagues our society.

883
00:47:43.631 --> 00:47:46.420
That the much harder things to solve so we don't solve them.

884
00:47:46.690 --> 00:47:47.920
We just sort of ignore them.

885
00:47:48.420 --> 00:47:51.580
We are disenfranchising African American voters all over this country with the

886
00:47:51.581 --> 00:47:55.150
gutting of the voting rights act by the Supreme Court with the Supreme Court did

887
00:47:55.151 --> 00:47:55.570
is so much,

888
00:47:55.570 --> 00:48:00.220
arguably worse and more racist and he's going to have more consequences for more

889
00:48:00.221 --> 00:48:03.550
African American people than what Donald Sterling did.

890
00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:08.140
Asshole old fuck with Alzheimer's puts foot in mouth and the whole country stops

891
00:48:08.141 --> 00:48:12.430
to fix that.
Right?
Nobody would rest until Donald Sterling was,

892
00:48:12.460 --> 00:48:14.770
was driven out.
And the Supreme Court,

893
00:48:14.771 --> 00:48:17.770
that's the voting rights act and disenfranchise millions of African American

894
00:48:17.771 --> 00:48:19.270
voters all over the south.
Nobody gives a fuck.

895
00:48:19.620 --> 00:48:20.730
<v 1>Well,
I don't think it's that,</v>

896
00:48:20.760 --> 00:48:23.550
and I certainly don't think that anybody thinks we fixed racism.

897
00:48:23.551 --> 00:48:26.880
I think that it's a gossipy thing and people love gossip and they caught an old

898
00:48:26.881 --> 00:48:28.470
man doing something he's not supposed to be.

899
00:48:28.680 --> 00:48:31.440
And part of the salaciousness of it is that it's on a recording.

900
00:48:31.441 --> 00:48:35.430
He didn't know it's being recorded and the girlfriend is young and he's old.

901
00:48:35.480 --> 00:48:39.030
And I don't think anybody's claiming that we fixed racism because we caught this

902
00:48:39.031 --> 00:48:43.140
dude.
But I think that what we're seeing now,
because of the fact that any credit,

903
00:48:43.141 --> 00:48:46.890
but he can be recorded at any point in time to say that what we're seeing now is

904
00:48:46.910 --> 00:48:50.130
we're seeing this access to information that we were talking about earlier,

905
00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:51.780
that things are getting very weird.

906
00:48:51.781 --> 00:48:56.340
The lines between privacy and public are getting very weird and we're also

907
00:48:56.341 --> 00:48:59.850
seeing that there's a certain amount of people that have a reaction to what we

908
00:48:59.851 --> 00:49:03.570
deem to be a racist thing,
a racist,
a racist act.

909
00:49:03.571 --> 00:49:05.280
What he did and were upset about it.

910
00:49:05.430 --> 00:49:08.840
I don't think it absolves the supreme quarter that I think people conveniently

911
00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:12.060
ignore the supreme court because it's confusing at what we choose to get upset

912
00:49:12.061 --> 00:49:13.590
about,
like what we choose to pay attention to

913
00:49:14.300 --> 00:49:17.870
<v 3>people in the wake of Donald Sterling saying,
Oh,</v>

914
00:49:17.871 --> 00:49:20.300
this is evidence of the progress we've made,

915
00:49:20.390 --> 00:49:22.280
but I think it is evidence of the progress that we've made.

916
00:49:22.281 --> 00:49:23.390
What about the evidence?

917
00:49:23.630 --> 00:49:28.630
The much greater and weightier evidence of the have moving backwards on voting

918
00:49:28.791 --> 00:49:31.700
rights for people of Color?
I don't think they're mutually exclusive.

919
00:49:31.730 --> 00:49:34.190
I think that's true.
That is true that there's,

920
00:49:34.250 --> 00:49:35.840
they can both happen simultaneously,

921
00:49:35.841 --> 00:49:39.200
but the conversation about sterling was so much louder,

922
00:49:39.201 --> 00:49:42.440
longer and more impassioned on all parts.

923
00:49:42.620 --> 00:49:44.750
Then the conversation about voter rights,

924
00:49:44.770 --> 00:49:48.530
he didn't understand that sterling thing is it's gossip and that's why he would

925
00:49:48.531 --> 00:49:50.270
bold.
It's a story as old as time

926
00:49:51.490 --> 00:49:54.190
<v 1>young woman who's young and hot and he fucks her for money,</v>

927
00:49:54.250 --> 00:49:55.870
<v 3>but look at the way people understand it.</v>

928
00:49:55.871 --> 00:50:00.640
People understand it to mean we've made this tremendous progress on issues of

929
00:50:00.641 --> 00:50:04.150
race in our country and our culture and our politics and our media and in

930
00:50:04.151 --> 00:50:09.151
actuality the real story is we're going backwards fast and gutting Donald

931
00:50:11.590 --> 00:50:14.830
Sterling on primetime.
Television doesn't change that.
I think socially it does.

932
00:50:14.980 --> 00:50:18.670
I think socially it makes people a little bit more aware of the that people have

933
00:50:18.671 --> 00:50:22.660
an intolerance for race or culture and society can do blatantly racist shit.

934
00:50:23.540 --> 00:50:25.780
<v 1>No,
it's not that I shoot the supreme court thing.
I say,</v>

935
00:50:25.800 --> 00:50:28.700
I did disagree with you on this because don't think the supreme court thing is,

936
00:50:28.701 --> 00:50:33.590
I think it's ignored first of all by the mainstream media because people tend to

937
00:50:33.591 --> 00:50:35.690
blank out.
When you talk about the Supreme Court,

938
00:50:35.691 --> 00:50:38.870
there's a certain amount of people that are aware and intelligent and concerned

939
00:50:39.110 --> 00:50:41.570
and active in voting and all these,
you know,

940
00:50:41.750 --> 00:50:45.770
various laws that get passed that are very detrimental to the way we live our

941
00:50:45.771 --> 00:50:49.400
lives and racist they,
they're aware of them.

942
00:50:49.460 --> 00:50:51.290
And there's plenty of websites that cover these things,

943
00:50:51.410 --> 00:50:53.690
but I think mainstream news,
whether it's Fox News,

944
00:50:53.691 --> 00:50:55.490
whether it's CNN or they ignore it,

945
00:50:55.491 --> 00:50:58.010
and one of the reasons why they ignore it cause it's the goddamn ratings killer.

946
00:50:58.011 --> 00:51:01.310
Cause most people don't understand how laws are created and they don't

947
00:51:01.311 --> 00:51:02.540
understand what,

948
00:51:02.570 --> 00:51:06.320
what happens when it comes to the Supreme Court and the politics and the Senate

949
00:51:06.570 --> 00:51:10.370
and Congress.
It's all very confusing and they zone out when that shit goes on.

950
00:51:10.560 --> 00:51:13.800
<v 3>And it is the responsibility of the media to make the real story be exciting,</v>

951
00:51:13.801 --> 00:51:16.320
sexy one that that's where it gets carried.
You look his way.

952
00:51:16.321 --> 00:51:20.250
We're all media in January in this or is it,
is it Jews distribution?

953
00:51:20.251 --> 00:51:22.980
January is going to come around and we're all going to filleted ourselves

954
00:51:23.010 --> 00:51:25.470
celebrating Martin Luther King Day and wonderful and awesome.

955
00:51:25.471 --> 00:51:30.210
That is meanwhile what Martin Luther King fought for a wasn't just,

956
00:51:30.240 --> 00:51:33.630
you know,
the civil rights movement wasn't just about,
uh,
you know,

957
00:51:33.631 --> 00:51:37.290
eating lunch at the Woolworth's counter.
It was about registering people to vote.

958
00:51:37.291 --> 00:51:41.930
It was about a poll taxes and pull tests.
Um,

959
00:51:41.970 --> 00:51:44.820
and the disenfranchisement of African American voters all through the south.

960
00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:49.290
We are back there.
We are back to that disenfranchised what he fought against.

961
00:51:49.490 --> 00:51:52.650
It makes me think way back to argue about this.
Yeah,
it's funny,
right?

962
00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:54.930
The voting rights act,
the gutting of the voting rights act,

963
00:51:54.931 --> 00:51:59.580
the day after the voting rights act was gutted.
All these states that had,
uh,

964
00:52:00.410 --> 00:52:04.980
uh,
voter ID laws that disenfranchise primarily people of Color,

965
00:52:05.290 --> 00:52:09.450
um,
that were on hold because there were being contested in court by the federal

966
00:52:09.451 --> 00:52:12.000
government immediately implemented that.
For folks who don't know.

967
00:52:13.120 --> 00:52:18.090
Explain what it means.
Explain voter ID laws,
voter ID laws to combat vote fraud,

968
00:52:18.091 --> 00:52:20.970
of which there is no evidence that there's any sort of vote fraud going on,

969
00:52:20.971 --> 00:52:23.710
any form of courses.
And vote fraud means you show up and vote,
uh,

970
00:52:24.240 --> 00:52:26.850
at a polling place pretending to be someone you're not.
That's vote fraud.

971
00:52:27.030 --> 00:52:28.780
You can register to vote.
Uh,

972
00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:31.620
Mickey Mouse can registered about Mickey mouse can't show up to vote,
right?

973
00:52:31.621 --> 00:52:34.170
So somebody is going to show up,
pretend to be Joe Rogan and,

974
00:52:34.171 --> 00:52:38.100
and vote in your place,
right?
That doesn't happen to throw elections.

975
00:52:38.130 --> 00:52:38.963
It doesn't happen.

976
00:52:39.120 --> 00:52:43.020
Voter ID laws are ostensibly designed to stop this thing that doesn't happen,

977
00:52:43.050 --> 00:52:46.980
which is voter fraud.
And it requires someone to have a photo,

978
00:52:46.981 --> 00:52:50.490
a government issued photo identification,
which a lot of people,

979
00:52:50.491 --> 00:52:54.720
particularly poor people,
people of color don't have.
They're registered to vote.

980
00:52:54.960 --> 00:52:57.470
They have addresses,
they have,
uh,
you know,

981
00:52:57.530 --> 00:52:59.400
bills that come to their house with their names and their addresses.

982
00:52:59.401 --> 00:53:02.550
And if they can prove that they're them,
they don't have a driver's license.

983
00:53:02.730 --> 00:53:05.550
And so people who are in their nineties people are in their eighties African

984
00:53:05.551 --> 00:53:09.840
Americans in the south who have been voting since the 60s since they won the

985
00:53:09.841 --> 00:53:11.040
right to vote in the south,

986
00:53:11.370 --> 00:53:14.670
are showing up the Poles being turned away because they don't have a driver's

987
00:53:14.671 --> 00:53:15.181
license.
Well,

988
00:53:15.181 --> 00:53:18.570
they don't drive and the same governments or the same state governments that are

989
00:53:19.050 --> 00:53:24.050
instituting many of these voter id laws are closing voter id places where voters

990
00:53:24.751 --> 00:53:26.130
can identification

991
00:53:26.370 --> 00:53:27.360
<v 2>or Eric shutting down.</v>

992
00:53:27.361 --> 00:53:30.540
DMV branches are making it harder to get the ID that you need to vote.

993
00:53:30.541 --> 00:53:32.910
They're just raising the bar,
make it more and more difficult,

994
00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:36.690
particularly for poor people,
African American people,
young people to vote.

995
00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:41.430
And this is going on and this is blatantly racist and it is going on while the

996
00:53:41.431 --> 00:53:44.040
Donald Sterling thing is going on and all we can talk about it.
Donald Sterling,

997
00:53:44.280 --> 00:53:44.401
well,

998
00:53:44.401 --> 00:53:49.401
this was sort of a highlighted by the Al Gore Administration where the Al Gore

999
00:53:49.531 --> 00:53:51.860
campaign,
when he was running for president and they,

1000
00:53:51.861 --> 00:53:55.230
they did this all throughout Florida,
did through this all throughout the south.

1001
00:53:55.830 --> 00:53:59.850
They shut people out.
A lot of people purge the voter rolls.
They keep doing it.

1002
00:54:00.260 --> 00:54:05.260
They're doing it in Florida before 2012 purging the voter roles and done

1003
00:54:05.821 --> 00:54:09.270
specifically to try to keep Democrats for voting.
And Yeah,
weirdly,

1004
00:54:09.271 --> 00:54:12.570
when you looked at who is being purged,
a poor precincts,

1005
00:54:12.870 --> 00:54:15.420
precincts that had democrats,
people of color,

1006
00:54:15.810 --> 00:54:20.160
and also went on the same time the Diebold voting scandal was going on where the

1007
00:54:20.190 --> 00:54:22.230
hacking democracy documentary was released,

1008
00:54:22.231 --> 00:54:25.740
where they showed that not only are these Diebold electronic voting machines

1009
00:54:25.741 --> 00:54:28.260
hackable,
but they're engineered to be hackable,

1010
00:54:28.320 --> 00:54:31.980
engineered to have a third party access.
Everything should change.

1011
00:54:32.100 --> 00:54:36.150
Everything should be paid for about you think.
Yeah.
And vote by mail,

1012
00:54:36.540 --> 00:54:39.030
which is what we have in Washington state.
Everything's vote by mail.

1013
00:54:40.050 --> 00:54:43.320
We have no polling places.
You've got,
you've registered to vote,

1014
00:54:43.321 --> 00:54:46.650
you get your ballot in the mail,
it comes to your house,
you fill it out,

1015
00:54:46.651 --> 00:54:47.520
he put it back in the mail.

1016
00:54:47.560 --> 00:54:50.910
Do you think people should be able to vote online if there was a way to make it

1017
00:54:50.911 --> 00:54:52.870
secure and there should be a way to make it secure?
Peter,

1018
00:54:52.920 --> 00:54:56.120
we've made banking secure online.
Uh,
I do think there should be a way to vote.

1019
00:54:56.130 --> 00:54:59.220
I'm like,
but I'm,
but,
but that like,
you know,

1020
00:54:59.221 --> 00:55:02.610
somebody could hack that somebody hacked target somebody if they've got online

1021
00:55:02.611 --> 00:55:05.820
voting pardon?
Think they can hack money.
I mean they can hack anything.
I mean,

1022
00:55:05.930 --> 00:55:10.080
if that's where worries about we,
they certainly can hack paper voting.
I mean,

1023
00:55:10.081 --> 00:55:13.230
they did that all the hanging chads.
Remember that?
Yeah.

1024
00:55:13.480 --> 00:55:16.710
And I mean that's the butterfly ballot in 2000 that gave us George W.

1025
00:55:16.710 --> 00:55:17.610
Bush for president.
Yeah.

1026
00:55:17.640 --> 00:55:20.220
I mean there was a lot of shit that they've done without a doubt.
I mean,

1027
00:55:20.221 --> 00:55:25.221
how many bags of fucking voter receipts have gone missing throughout the years?

1028
00:55:25.560 --> 00:55:27.750
People have had paper voting.
I mean,
how many,

1029
00:55:27.810 --> 00:55:31.530
how many people have hidden things or change things or move things around?

1030
00:55:31.680 --> 00:55:33.300
That's essentially the same as hacking.

1031
00:55:33.330 --> 00:55:38.330
It's actually probably less traceable than electronic hacking could be if done

1032
00:55:38.491 --> 00:55:41.900
correctly,
through a very secure way.
What are the same way that banking stuff?

1033
00:55:41.910 --> 00:55:42.980
One of the ways you can,
uh,

1034
00:55:43.170 --> 00:55:47.240
prevent hacking the vote at Washington state where we have a main all male in it

1035
00:55:47.400 --> 00:55:51.930
is you can track your vote online that you,
uh,
you send in your ballot.

1036
00:55:52.220 --> 00:55:53.910
Um,
did they send it to you?

1037
00:55:53.910 --> 00:55:57.540
You send it back and then there's a website you can go to and it will indicate

1038
00:55:57.541 --> 00:56:01.980
when your ballot has been received and when your ballot has been counted.
Hmm.

1039
00:56:02.190 --> 00:56:04.070
That's a good idea.
I mean,
that doesn't,

1040
00:56:04.071 --> 00:56:06.420
so that if you vote and you feel like your balance been misplaced,

1041
00:56:06.421 --> 00:56:09.630
you feel like your ballot may have been trashed or you know,
you,

1042
00:56:09.631 --> 00:56:12.840
you worry that somebody could be breaking in and stealing ballots and throwing

1043
00:56:12.841 --> 00:56:13.530
them away.

1044
00:56:13.530 --> 00:56:17.640
You can go and make sure that your ballot was processed and counted so that if

1045
00:56:17.641 --> 00:56:19.650
your belt went missing,
you can vote again.

1046
00:56:19.680 --> 00:56:22.830
You can go down to the county and do a provisional ballot.
Well,

1047
00:56:22.831 --> 00:56:24.040
that's a great idea.
I mean,

1048
00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:25.480
<v 1>I think that that if,</v>

1049
00:56:25.580 --> 00:56:30.250
if that's implemented nationwide and done and some sort of an electronic way,

1050
00:56:30.280 --> 00:56:33.820
I mean we can have a radical shifts in the way people are elected.

1051
00:56:33.950 --> 00:56:36.890
<v 3>But like Bill Maher said last week on a real time,
Republicans,</v>

1052
00:56:36.920 --> 00:56:39.770
when when people don't vote,
they want to drive the boat down.

1053
00:56:40.390 --> 00:56:45.110
And so you have one party that is that self interest lies in not getting more

1054
00:56:45.111 --> 00:56:47.930
people to vote.
That's why they're shutting down early voting stations.

1055
00:56:48.110 --> 00:56:51.860
That's why they're closing polling places in states controlled by the Republican

1056
00:56:51.860 --> 00:56:53.360
party because they want fewer people to vote.

1057
00:56:53.361 --> 00:56:56.010
It would be great if we had a universal,
uh,

1058
00:56:56.240 --> 00:56:59.630
or an Australian system where voting is mandatory.
You pay a 10 buck fine.

1059
00:56:59.631 --> 00:57:02.630
If you don't want to vote,
you don't have to vote to 10 bucks,
fine or something.

1060
00:57:03.060 --> 00:57:07.160
It's a monetary Ding if you don't vote in Australia.
But if everybody voted,

1061
00:57:07.161 --> 00:57:09.100
we would have gun control.
Well

1062
00:57:09.560 --> 00:57:12.050
<v 1>that should be a way.
If,
um,
if you could,</v>

1063
00:57:12.160 --> 00:57:14.810
<v 3>no,
everyone voted,
we'd have health care,
we'd have national healthcare.</v>

1064
00:57:14.860 --> 00:57:19.080
All of these things are popular with average voters who don't vote because

1065
00:57:19.090 --> 00:57:19.923
they're not motivated

1066
00:57:20.170 --> 00:57:22.570
<v 1>be a way where if you don't vote,</v>

1067
00:57:22.600 --> 00:57:25.480
you have less access to something.

1068
00:57:26.700 --> 00:57:31.390
If you only could access online porn after voting,
everybody would fucking about,

1069
00:57:31.510 --> 00:57:34.900
well it'd be interesting at least find out where people's priorities lie.

1070
00:57:35.200 --> 00:57:36.370
But I think if you,

1071
00:57:36.371 --> 00:57:41.200
if you made it set up so that there was some sort of a social,
a price to pay,

1072
00:57:41.560 --> 00:57:45.130
you know,
like maybe there was,
didn't have access to national parks.

1073
00:57:45.150 --> 00:57:49.330
He didn't have access to certain things.
If you didn't vote like your,
your,

1074
00:57:49.331 --> 00:57:50.790
your lack of participation.
Yes.

1075
00:57:50.850 --> 00:57:52.920
<v 3>That runs up against the first amendment because there's a,</v>

1076
00:57:52.921 --> 00:57:55.770
there's an argument to be made that not voting itself as a form of speech,

1077
00:57:56.050 --> 00:57:59.700
that it's to reject either all the candidates who are on offer it to reject the

1078
00:57:59.701 --> 00:58:04.701
system itself and to advocate by refusing to participate some other form of

1079
00:58:04.771 --> 00:58:09.390
government.
Uh,
and so you know that that's not,
that can't be implemented.

1080
00:58:09.391 --> 00:58:12.270
Something like punishment because of the first amendment punishment for not

1081
00:58:12.271 --> 00:58:13.420
voting because uh,

1082
00:58:13.920 --> 00:58:16.500
it's totally legit argument to make that non voting as a form of speech.

1083
00:58:16.620 --> 00:58:19.440
<v 1>Well,
there's also a big problem with the voting system itself.</v>

1084
00:58:19.441 --> 00:58:22.200
The two party system is inherently flawed and not only that,

1085
00:58:22.230 --> 00:58:25.580
you have both sides being supported by the same corporations left and right,

1086
00:58:25.581 --> 00:58:26.414
and we need personal

1087
00:58:26.570 --> 00:58:28.390
<v 3>waystation.
Until we have that,</v>

1088
00:58:28.540 --> 00:58:31.670
we're going to have this corporate is democracy that's a little fucked.
You know,

1089
00:58:31.690 --> 00:58:35.170
we seem to
manage your,

1090
00:58:35.171 --> 00:58:37.540
your hopefulness for the survival of the species on the planet.

1091
00:58:37.541 --> 00:58:41.380
I have that sort of hopefulness for our democracy and the way it sort of Koreans

1092
00:58:41.381 --> 00:58:45.610
from near disaster to near disaster and then writes itself.
Um,

1093
00:58:45.940 --> 00:58:50.760
I think our democracy is,
uh,
perhaps,
um,
healthier,
uh,

1094
00:58:51.040 --> 00:58:54.560
and likely to survive than the planet itself.
I think it's in the plan,

1095
00:58:54.561 --> 00:58:57.970
in our democracy,
the earth that our culture and society depends on it.

1096
00:58:57.971 --> 00:58:59.320
Your live is less likely to,

1097
00:58:59.870 --> 00:59:00.990
<v 1>I think it's a puppet show.</v>

1098
00:59:00.991 --> 00:59:03.840
I think that what we're dealing with now is massive corporations that have

1099
00:59:03.841 --> 00:59:07.110
incredible influence,
that pay politicians to support their causes.

1100
00:59:07.140 --> 00:59:10.050
And that's what,
that's what we call voting.
We have two choices,

1101
00:59:10.230 --> 00:59:12.750
but strong choice in the left,
one strong choice in the right,

1102
00:59:12.990 --> 00:59:17.250
both of them in many ways are supported by the same entrance.
That's ridiculous.

1103
00:59:17.280 --> 00:59:20.820
That's not voting.
I mean,
that's just,
it's,
it's a false choice,

1104
00:59:20.850 --> 00:59:22.130
which why some people don't

1105
00:59:22.130 --> 00:59:26.210
<v 2>vote and that is protected speech to not vote.
But there are certain issues,</v>

1106
00:59:26.211 --> 00:59:30.590
social issues that the left tends to favor that the right ignores.

1107
00:59:30.591 --> 00:59:34.880
And there's certain issues that the right tends to favor and the left ignore or

1108
00:59:34.910 --> 00:59:39.350
opposes,
it gets weird,
man.
It gets weird because people love to be in a group.

1109
00:59:39.440 --> 00:59:43.070
They love to be on a team.
They love to be,
you know,
whatever it is,
whether it's,

1110
00:59:43.071 --> 00:59:46.280
uh,
you know,
uh,
people that,
uh,
drive Chevy's,

1111
00:59:46.340 --> 00:59:49.160
they love to be in a group of other Chevy owners.
You know,
they love it.

1112
00:59:49.161 --> 00:59:52.640
If they feel that camaraderie,
they can feel like a team.
I'm a parent,
you know,

1113
00:59:52.641 --> 00:59:57.470
my kids careening towards 18.
And uh,
you know,
you talk about tribalism,

1114
00:59:58.010 --> 01:00:01.070
family identity that like you from a Republican family.

1115
01:00:01.280 --> 01:00:03.560
And I'd always hear that and I wouldn't,
I never quite understood it,

1116
01:00:03.690 --> 01:00:06.890
but I get it now because I say to my,
you know,
I've said to my son,

1117
01:00:06.891 --> 01:00:09.350
when you're 18,
you're registered to vote.
If you're still living in this house,

1118
01:00:09.351 --> 01:00:12.560
you're registered to vote and God help you if you vote Republican,
this is,

1119
01:00:12.770 --> 01:00:15.130
why would you say that though?
It would if he,

1120
01:00:15.260 --> 01:00:17.890
he has different opinions and she allowed to have different opinions.

1121
01:00:17.910 --> 01:00:20.140
He's allowed to have different opinions if he's paying his own rent and over

1122
01:00:20.230 --> 01:00:24.320
food.
Oh God,
not,
I'm going to monitor his vote or anything.
And it's like joking,

1123
01:00:24.321 --> 01:00:25.910
like,
I'll kill you if you voted Republican.

1124
01:00:25.911 --> 01:00:28.880
I'm not going to like a hover over him as he boats.
But you know,

1125
01:00:28.940 --> 01:00:32.330
families do impart a certain,
uh,
political identity,

1126
01:00:32.390 --> 01:00:35.810
not just a religious identity,
your cultural identity.
And we're,

1127
01:00:35.930 --> 01:00:39.200
we're really doing that to our code.
I think that socially though,

1128
01:00:39.201 --> 01:00:43.490
people don't like that.
When you suppress.
Like there's a school that,
uh,

1129
01:00:43.491 --> 01:00:46.670
one of my daughter's friends goes to where you can't have different color hair.

1130
01:00:47.240 --> 01:00:50.750
You know?
Uh,
like if you,
if you dry dye your hair color,
that's not natural.

1131
01:00:50.780 --> 01:00:54.020
They freak out at you.
They won't let you do it.
And I'm like,
that's ridiculous.

1132
01:00:54.021 --> 01:00:57.620
Because then if you tell a girl that you can't have pink hair,
green hair,

1133
01:00:57.621 --> 01:01:00.680
tell boy he can't dye his hair purple.
They're going to fucking hate you.

1134
01:01:00.980 --> 01:01:03.680
Like who are you?
What difference does it make?
I don't have any hair.

1135
01:01:03.681 --> 01:01:06.680
How about that?
You know,
what difference does it make?
I mean,
am I allowed to,

1136
01:01:06.681 --> 01:01:08.420
I have to wear a wig to being your fucking school.

1137
01:01:08.421 --> 01:01:10.370
Why does the school have that policy?
They're assholes.

1138
01:01:10.410 --> 01:01:13.220
They're a bunch of old ass holes that grew up without the internet probably.

1139
01:01:13.221 --> 01:01:15.740
They set all these rules.
They want people to behave a certain way.

1140
01:01:15.830 --> 01:01:19.130
Why do they make you put your fucking seat backup when you're landing a plane?

1141
01:01:19.310 --> 01:01:23.660
Is someone going to die?
It's bullshit.
It's nonsense.
It's a control issue.

1142
01:01:23.661 --> 01:01:28.661
It doesn't have any bearing whatsoever on safety bearing on safety to seeping

1143
01:01:28.701 --> 01:01:30.320
up.
Absolutely.
Yeah.

1144
01:01:30.321 --> 01:01:32.930
Cause it makes it easier for people to get out of their aisle in a hurry.

1145
01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:37.700
Like if the seats are all winky Janky,
I got for you to evacuate the plane.

1146
01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:41.270
That fucking plane goes down.
It ain't gonna matter.
It does matter.

1147
01:01:41.300 --> 01:01:44.120
Look at the plane that landed in the Hudson and everybody had to get the hustle

1148
01:01:44.121 --> 01:01:48.380
out of a ticket on the wings as it sank.
There's that plane crash.
Oh God.

1149
01:01:48.381 --> 01:01:48.861
Where was it?

1150
01:01:48.861 --> 01:01:51.650
Where the poor kids got run over by fire trucks and then they were running out

1151
01:01:51.651 --> 01:01:53.840
of the plane after crashing.
Most people got off that plane.

1152
01:01:53.841 --> 01:01:55.490
Some people burned to death on that plan because they didn't,

1153
01:01:55.520 --> 01:01:56.690
they couldn't get off it in time.

1154
01:01:57.100 --> 01:02:01.190
Partly because some people were getting their more bags and trying to get their

1155
01:02:01.191 --> 01:02:03.770
bags as they evacuated the planet that you don't want.
You know,

1156
01:02:03.771 --> 01:02:06.380
maybe some people were,
you know,
Americans are big.

1157
01:02:06.410 --> 01:02:08.030
Maybe some people were wedged behind.

1158
01:02:08.330 --> 01:02:11.270
That's a size of shaky janky seats in the first class.

1159
01:02:11.330 --> 01:02:14.090
[inaudible] this fucking ain't gonna do shit.

1160
01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:18.550
Does the difference between getting out God goddamn gap and the eye.

1161
01:02:18.551 --> 01:02:20.130
You've been in coach on United lately.

1162
01:02:20.130 --> 01:02:22.950
<v 1>Holy Crap.
Yeah.
I was in coach on the,
I did a month ago.</v>

1163
01:02:23.220 --> 01:02:25.650
Floss your teeth with the hair of the person sitting in front of you.

1164
01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:29.560
Well I had my computer open and the guy in front of me sat back and my computer

1165
01:02:29.561 --> 01:02:31.950
shut like it was on the tray.

1166
01:02:31.980 --> 01:02:35.760
The guy put his seat back and it literally closed the computer.
I couldn't,

1167
01:02:36.270 --> 01:02:39.570
I had to like scoot back and push it forward like this.
If we had,

1168
01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:43.290
if we had a real democracy we would have a referendum on non declining nine non

1169
01:02:43.291 --> 01:02:46.890
reclining seats.
Like every seat set to a certain pitch and no up and down,

1170
01:02:46.891 --> 01:02:47.970
no reclining bullshit,

1171
01:02:48.390 --> 01:02:51.110
no passive aggressive game playing on airplanes anymore apartment.
Right.

1172
01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:53.580
So maybe the back seat back thing doesn't work.

1173
01:02:53.610 --> 01:02:55.800
That argument doesn't work as far as United goes,

1174
01:02:55.801 --> 01:03:00.360
but the reason why people tell people they can't have color hair is because

1175
01:03:00.361 --> 01:03:03.330
they're trying to control them and we try to control people.
They rebound.

1176
01:03:03.420 --> 01:03:06.780
You grew up Catholic?
I was Catholic too.
For a little bit.
And uh,

1177
01:03:06.781 --> 01:03:07.614
when I was a kid,

1178
01:03:07.620 --> 01:03:12.000
we always knew that Catholic girls were the biggest sluts and the reason why

1179
01:03:12.001 --> 01:03:15.670
Catholic girls are the biggest slap to my mother and my sister's honor.
Asthma,

1180
01:03:15.900 --> 01:03:19.350
not slut shaming.
But when you suppress people,

1181
01:03:19.380 --> 01:03:22.050
when you suppress people like that,
we don't think about it.
Banana,

1182
01:03:22.110 --> 01:03:25.380
they fucking go crazy.
People don't like other people telling them what to do.

1183
01:03:25.381 --> 01:03:29.790
They go bananas.
They don't like it.
It's done.
It's not natural.
It's not healthy.

1184
01:03:30.060 --> 01:03:32.460
And when they can look at it objectively and go,

1185
01:03:32.461 --> 01:03:34.770
what fucking difference does it make?
If my hair is pink,

1186
01:03:34.920 --> 01:03:37.710
your hair could be pink and you could be a gun damn scientist that saves the

1187
01:03:37.711 --> 01:03:41.010
world.
It does not matter what call your fucking hair is.
Well,

1188
01:03:41.011 --> 01:03:44.010
why do you send your kid bear?
No,
I don't.
Oh,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.

1189
01:03:44.011 --> 01:03:48.370
It's one of my daughter's friends.
Oh,
no,
no,
no.
I thought you sent your no,
no,
no,

1190
01:03:48.371 --> 01:03:50.240
no,
no.
I think it's,
it's,

1191
01:03:50.241 --> 01:03:55.080
it's just a function of people who they want control and they don't worry about

1192
01:03:55.081 --> 01:03:57.290
the repercussions of that control.
You know,

1193
01:03:57.300 --> 01:04:01.440
and I think that Republicans tend to be more in that camp,

1194
01:04:01.441 --> 01:04:04.410
but they tend to be more in the camp of people who want control.

1195
01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:07.710
They tend to be more in the camp for your change.
They want ties.

1196
01:04:07.711 --> 01:04:10.320
They want you to,
you know,
wear loafers,
stay in line.

1197
01:04:10.321 --> 01:04:12.900
They don't want you to be gay.
They don't want you to be weird.

1198
01:04:12.901 --> 01:04:15.480
They don't want you to be,
you know,
they don't want you to have tattoos.

1199
01:04:15.481 --> 01:04:18.790
They don't mind if you're gay.
You just have to be closeted.
Yeah,
that's,

1200
01:04:18.820 --> 01:04:20.490
that's it.
That's a real weird one,
isn't it?

1201
01:04:21.060 --> 01:04:23.850
What did you think about the whole thing that was going on during the Bush

1202
01:04:23.851 --> 01:04:26.010
administration when Jeff Gannon was in the White House,

1203
01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:29.780
but he's an embedded reporter for folks who don't know.
It was a guy who would,

1204
01:04:29.790 --> 01:04:31.470
not only was he a gay prostitute,

1205
01:04:31.471 --> 01:04:36.090
but he ran a gay prostitute website and he would be an embedded reporter and he

1206
01:04:36.091 --> 01:04:41.070
would lobbed softballs at the president.
Mr President.
Awesome.

1207
01:04:41.071 --> 01:04:42.450
Are you today?
How are you?
Awesome.

1208
01:04:42.451 --> 01:04:45.270
Are the yesterday and do you believe that we all summer tomorrow than you are

1209
01:04:45.271 --> 01:04:45.630
today?

1210
01:04:45.630 --> 01:04:50.280
My favorite one is when are these Democrats going to come to realize how

1211
01:04:50.281 --> 01:04:54.580
ridiculous their ideas are?
Like it was literally,

1212
01:04:54.600 --> 01:04:56.190
that was like one of his questions.

1213
01:04:56.191 --> 01:05:01.140
He would throw these stupid fucking softball back story to that that we are

1214
01:05:01.141 --> 01:05:04.230
never going to get that's like locked up in some safe.
Oh yeah.

1215
01:05:04.260 --> 01:05:06.930
He got credentialed who he knew in the White House.

1216
01:05:07.260 --> 01:05:11.400
How he got all tied into that dude that was chasing kind of star.

1217
01:05:11.401 --> 01:05:14.490
It was all tied into him.
And uh,
who's the guy who,
uh,
the,

1218
01:05:14.491 --> 01:05:19.480
the main engineer guy who got Bush office and he,
Karl Rove.
Yeah.

1219
01:05:19.481 --> 01:05:21.520
Karl Rove is notoriously closeted,
right.

1220
01:05:21.521 --> 01:05:26.050
Isn't supposedly allegedly never suck mine tech.
Well you should ask.

1221
01:05:26.080 --> 01:05:29.380
I bet he would say everything's my Dick won't do and call rose mouth would be

1222
01:05:29.381 --> 01:05:30.820
really high on the list,
but it's still,

1223
01:05:30.821 --> 01:05:32.920
he's never seen some sort of a glory hit thing.

1224
01:05:33.080 --> 01:05:35.990
Laurie whole thing going on that would be an in glory,
this whole,

1225
01:05:35.991 --> 01:05:39.310
it's somebody he had spent the night at the White House and more than one

1226
01:05:39.311 --> 01:05:39.791
occasion.

1227
01:05:39.791 --> 01:05:44.620
So there's some inherent weirdness involved in that guy to have sex in the White

1228
01:05:44.620 --> 01:05:47.530
House.
But not only that,
they also,
like when you,

1229
01:05:47.740 --> 01:05:52.740
I always say if you look at people that are trying to like actively trying to

1230
01:05:52.931 --> 01:05:56.110
oppose gay marriage,
you know,
actively trying to pose gay relationships,

1231
01:05:56.111 --> 01:05:59.500
trying to stop them almost always or something gay going

1232
01:06:00.010 --> 01:06:01.960
<v 3>journalizing and internal conflict.</v>

1233
01:06:02.320 --> 01:06:06.000
When you look at somebody like Marcus Bachmann who yes,

1234
01:06:06.420 --> 01:06:10.660
Michele Bachmann's husband show Bachmann's husband who is pray the gay away who

1235
01:06:10.661 --> 01:06:15.400
is gay or Sound Asleep on the sofa than I am with a my Dick in my husband's ass.

1236
01:06:15.750 --> 01:06:19.840
That man is on fire.
Right.
And we can all see it.

1237
01:06:19.870 --> 01:06:22.930
And you know,
I don't know if he's actually gay or not,

1238
01:06:22.931 --> 01:06:27.931
but he certainly plays one on TV and you and his whole practice,

1239
01:06:29.060 --> 01:06:32.680
part of his practice is devoted to x gay therapy to talking other people out of

1240
01:06:32.681 --> 01:06:33.880
what he talked himself out of being.

1241
01:06:34.120 --> 01:06:39.120
There's a lot of rage that fuels the anti gay movement and its people by the

1242
01:06:40.091 --> 01:06:41.710
people who say being gay is a choice.

1243
01:06:42.100 --> 01:06:45.220
They saying sexual orientation as a choice because they chose not to be gay.

1244
01:06:45.221 --> 01:06:47.000
They chose not to come out and identify as gay.

1245
01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:50.950
They are gay and they keep getting out at Ted Haggard,
George Recurs.

1246
01:06:51.100 --> 01:06:54.820
There's all these examples of prominent people in the anti gay right on the x

1247
01:06:54.821 --> 01:06:55.660
game movement itself.

1248
01:06:55.661 --> 01:07:00.310
Like George Recurs who get caught with Dicks of course because they've

1249
01:07:00.311 --> 01:07:02.260
externalize this internal conflict.
I would love,

1250
01:07:02.280 --> 01:07:06.790
you know as somebody I write to a lot of like young people and it would be so

1251
01:07:06.791 --> 01:07:11.320
great if being rabidly homophobic became associated with being gay.

1252
01:07:11.530 --> 01:07:12.670
I think it is because,

1253
01:07:12.760 --> 01:07:15.340
because there's like there's homophobia out there like kids don't want anyone to

1254
01:07:15.341 --> 01:07:15.791
think they're gay.

1255
01:07:15.791 --> 01:07:18.210
So I say to these like high school and college age kids I sometimes talk to,

1256
01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:20.860
if you don't want anyone to think you're gay,
don't be anti gay.

1257
01:07:20.861 --> 01:07:23.320
Cause that makes people think you're gay.
Like if you don't,

1258
01:07:23.340 --> 01:07:25.990
if being gay being thought of as game makes you uncomfortable and squeaks you

1259
01:07:25.991 --> 01:07:29.080
out cause gay is Nikki,
then you better be cool with the gays.

1260
01:07:29.110 --> 01:07:30.610
Don't you think that's already the case though?

1261
01:07:30.940 --> 01:07:34.510
I think it's catching on but not entirely the case with high school,

1262
01:07:34.511 --> 01:07:39.010
college age kids still think homophobia,
the paranoia amongst any smart kids,

1263
01:07:39.011 --> 01:07:40.930
it is any smart kit,

1264
01:07:40.931 --> 01:07:43.930
it's getting battle sideways like well what are you so angry about?

1265
01:07:43.931 --> 01:07:47.950
Dude I did it and there's really quickly before we go on and their science here

1266
01:07:48.070 --> 01:07:52.240
that they have wired up with a penis amount or I can never say this word.

1267
01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:53.890
It's basically a glass tube.

1268
01:07:53.891 --> 01:07:57.460
You stick somebody sticking and you show them porn and it measures very subtle

1269
01:07:57.461 --> 01:08:02.410
blood flow changes to the deck and hardens and you show they took homophobes,

1270
01:08:02.411 --> 01:08:03.121
they measure these people.

1271
01:08:03.121 --> 01:08:06.190
Dot Tongue and measurement for their homophobia and they showed these guys gay

1272
01:08:06.191 --> 01:08:07.840
porn and they all got boners.

1273
01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:13.200
So like homophobia correlates very strongly with gay desire and arousal.

1274
01:08:13.420 --> 01:08:16.250
<v 1>Yeah.
Isn't it amazing that homophobes they actually</v>

1275
01:08:16.250 --> 01:08:17.630
<v 2>agreed to sign up for that.</v>

1276
01:08:17.880 --> 01:08:22.080
You might not be getting like the most unbiased fucking,

1277
01:08:22.370 --> 01:08:25.340
that group might be a mess.
I think we need to look at the research methodology,

1278
01:08:25.341 --> 01:08:28.970
but I do believe they didn't say we need homophobes for this study where we're

1279
01:08:28.971 --> 01:08:31.610
going to see if you're actually fags or not.
They didn't recruit,

1280
01:08:31.611 --> 01:08:32.960
cry quite bad night.

1281
01:08:33.080 --> 01:08:36.860
I had a joke in my last special that if you hate gay marriage is one of two

1282
01:08:36.861 --> 01:08:37.161
reasons.

1283
01:08:37.161 --> 01:08:40.430
Either you're really dumb or you secretly worried that Dick's are delicious.

1284
01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:44.420
The only two possibilities.
Otherwise,
why would you give a fuck?

1285
01:08:44.660 --> 01:08:48.380
It's like this guy,
this duck dynasty guy who always like,
I don't get it.

1286
01:08:48.410 --> 01:08:49.790
You know I don't get why man,

1287
01:08:49.791 --> 01:08:53.030
when you don't have to get everything like you don't.
I don't get yellow cars.

1288
01:08:53.031 --> 01:08:55.730
I don't get dubstep.
Certainly movies,

1289
01:08:55.731 --> 01:08:58.640
but I'm not trying to pass a constitutional amendment banning it.

1290
01:08:58.670 --> 01:09:01.490
That's the diff like I don't care if you don't get it,
it's not for you.

1291
01:09:01.491 --> 01:09:03.290
Like there are things that aren't for me and that's fine.

1292
01:09:03.380 --> 01:09:07.460
I like Rick Perry the other days comparing homosexuality to alcoholism because

1293
01:09:07.840 --> 01:09:10.970
you,
everybody knows like what does he Rick Perry telling us about himself?

1294
01:09:10.971 --> 01:09:13.250
Because you say to somebody who are alcoholic and they say,
Oh,

1295
01:09:13.251 --> 01:09:15.950
I just have a couple of drinks before dinner.
I'm not an alcoholic.
Like,
okay,

1296
01:09:15.951 --> 01:09:18.870
ready care.
He really,
yeah,
you're acquainted homosexuality now.
Awesome.

1297
01:09:18.930 --> 01:09:21.650
So as you basically saying,
you know,
you go to repair,
he like,
are you gay?
No,

1298
01:09:21.651 --> 01:09:23.250
I have a couple of dicks before dinner.
I'm not gay.

1299
01:09:23.251 --> 01:09:26.680
Or that's how it would work in.
They're exactly the same.

1300
01:09:27.680 --> 01:09:30.260
That's hilarious.
Rick Perry,
that guy was so silly.

1301
01:09:30.440 --> 01:09:33.020
He was one of my favorite guys ever debating when he got to that point where he

1302
01:09:33.021 --> 01:09:34.660
didn't remember what he was talking about.
He's like,
ah,

1303
01:09:34.661 --> 01:09:35.840
I don't remember the rest.

1304
01:09:35.900 --> 01:09:38.810
And he had the meltdown and that speech in Vermont where they gave him the maple

1305
01:09:38.811 --> 01:09:40.490
syrup and then he just kind of lost it.

1306
01:09:40.700 --> 01:09:43.450
My favorite thing about that though was the,

1307
01:09:43.570 --> 01:09:45.980
the whole country coming to the conclusion that this man,

1308
01:09:45.981 --> 01:09:47.840
Rick Perry was too stupid to be president,

1309
01:09:48.140 --> 01:09:49.970
but just stupid enough to be governor of Texas.

1310
01:09:49.971 --> 01:09:53.150
He needs to go home and keep on being governor of Texas cause he's not,

1311
01:09:53.620 --> 01:09:57.440
you can't be too stupid to be governor of Texas as we learned in 2000 Texas.

1312
01:09:57.441 --> 01:09:59.870
Didn't bother.
You know,
they,
they didn't care.

1313
01:09:59.980 --> 01:10:03.320
It didn't bother them whatsoever that he was all stupid shit,

1314
01:10:03.560 --> 01:10:06.950
fucking forgetting things.
But he's a leader.
He's a good man.

1315
01:10:07.070 --> 01:10:10.070
He represents my Christian values.
That's all I care about.
I mean,

1316
01:10:10.160 --> 01:10:12.590
how hard is it to be the Goddamn governor?
What are you going to do?

1317
01:10:12.920 --> 01:10:17.840
Keep the Mexicans out,
make sure I keep my guns.
I don't need a lot of government.

1318
01:10:18.200 --> 01:10:20.360
I don't need a lot of government.
That's the,

1319
01:10:20.390 --> 01:10:22.970
I don't need a lot of government argument is fascinating,

1320
01:10:23.390 --> 01:10:26.240
I think from the same people who are calling for more government patrols of the

1321
01:10:26.241 --> 01:10:29.450
border.
Yeah.
And more deportations.
How do you do that without more government?

1322
01:10:29.480 --> 01:10:33.230
What do I need that kind of calling for the government to stop women from having

1323
01:10:33.250 --> 01:10:36.800
abortions kind of government.
They want to shrink government.

1324
01:10:37.070 --> 01:10:39.890
So it's just small enough to jam up every woman's Twat.

1325
01:10:39.950 --> 01:10:42.620
Then government will be the perfect size.
That's Jesus government.

1326
01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:45.230
This is a different kinds of government that's in the Bible,
son.

1327
01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:49.310
Imagine if people had the same reactions to seafood that they do to gay marriage

1328
01:10:49.311 --> 01:10:53.000
or gay love,
because in the Bible like seafood,
shellfish,

1329
01:10:53.030 --> 01:10:56.030
it's very fucking bad for you.
They don't want it.
They don't want it.

1330
01:10:56.270 --> 01:11:01.270
So shellfish shouldn't pigs shrimp as many references more than gay marriage,

1331
01:11:01.910 --> 01:11:04.700
more than gay sex,
right wing fundamentalist Christians will tell you that,

1332
01:11:04.701 --> 01:11:08.930
you know,
that was the old law and Jesus negated it.
Now we have the new law,

1333
01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:13.680
but the New Testament support slavery,
uh,
obey your master as you would Christ.

1334
01:11:14.610 --> 01:11:18.570
The New Testament condemns Jesus and his own word condemns a divorce.

1335
01:11:19.320 --> 01:11:23.100
And anybody who is divorces,
his wife is committing adultery.
Um,

1336
01:11:23.370 --> 01:11:27.510
and you don't have a big mass Christian movement in this country to ban divorce,

1337
01:11:27.540 --> 01:11:30.600
just to attack gay people want to get married.
Yeah,
that would be the best way.

1338
01:11:30.601 --> 01:11:34.350
If you really wanted to prove the sanctity of marriage and divorce and divorce

1339
01:11:34.380 --> 01:11:38.280
and band Vegas chapels ones,
he can go in when you're fucking,

1340
01:11:38.281 --> 01:11:41.520
how about a three strikes?
You're out rule like get married three times,

1341
01:11:41.521 --> 01:11:43.800
but that's like Newt Gingrich.
This is your last one.

1342
01:11:43.801 --> 01:11:47.460
You fuck this one up nude and no more.
How many times has he been married?
Three.

1343
01:11:48.420 --> 01:11:51.120
I can't trust the people that that fat,
you're lazy.

1344
01:11:51.630 --> 01:11:53.880
If you get that fat and you're trying to be a leader like that.

1345
01:11:53.881 --> 01:11:56.700
Chris Christie guy like I have a lot of fat friends and they're great,

1346
01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:58.860
but they're lazy.
You can't run things.

1347
01:11:58.880 --> 01:12:02.220
You have to any personal demons and people could say,
oh,
you're fat shaming,

1348
01:12:02.221 --> 01:12:06.970
your fat shaming.
Look man,
what happens when you get a fucking a lap band?

1349
01:12:07.020 --> 01:12:10.830
What's going on there?
They're stopping you from consuming food.
They're not.

1350
01:12:11.100 --> 01:12:14.070
They're not really fixing anything other than they've making your stomach

1351
01:12:14.071 --> 01:12:17.880
smaller.
There's a lot of laziness involved in that argument.
It's a very silly,

1352
01:12:17.881 --> 01:12:21.270
silly argument.
And when you've got a big fat mutton face like Newt Gingrich,

1353
01:12:21.271 --> 01:12:25.020
because you're lazy,
you're a lazy person,
maybe you enjoy food.
You know,

1354
01:12:25.021 --> 01:12:29.070
I get in trouble sometimes with the fat acceptance movement because I believe,

1355
01:12:29.071 --> 01:12:31.170
and I have said,
and this gets called cat phobic,

1356
01:12:31.270 --> 01:12:34.470
that there is a relationship between how much you eat,
how much you move,

1357
01:12:34.471 --> 01:12:35.304
and how big you are.

1358
01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:39.300
I don't have any problem with people who are contented whatever size they want

1359
01:12:39.301 --> 01:12:40.050
to be.

1360
01:12:40.050 --> 01:12:43.380
I just have a problem with ims to pretend that there's no relationship between

1361
01:12:43.410 --> 01:12:47.050
consumption,
movement and size,
all this shit.

1362
01:12:47.150 --> 01:12:49.020
And Chris Christie,
if I said it,

1363
01:12:49.030 --> 01:12:52.350
if somebody had said before Chris Christie got his lap band that he has a food

1364
01:12:52.351 --> 01:12:55.410
problem,
that there's food issues.
That's why he's so big.

1365
01:12:55.680 --> 01:12:58.620
You would have been attacked by the fat acceptance Movement for food shaming him

1366
01:12:58.621 --> 01:13:00.330
or judging him.
And it's not always about food.

1367
01:13:00.570 --> 01:13:04.680
But then the intervention gets between Chris Christie and food and he starts

1368
01:13:04.681 --> 01:13:07.350
losing weight.
So clearly there was a food problem,
the intervention.

1369
01:13:07.350 --> 01:13:09.870
So there are people who aren't,
you know how he get a lap band.

1370
01:13:10.020 --> 01:13:12.390
He got a bariatric surgery.

1371
01:13:13.260 --> 01:13:15.810
That's why he's losing so much weight and lost like a year and a half ago.

1372
01:13:15.811 --> 01:13:18.680
I don't pay attention to him running up running for,
he's going to win.
You know,

1373
01:13:18.750 --> 01:13:20.610
before the bridge scandal came along and fucked him.

1374
01:13:20.820 --> 01:13:21.990
He was gonna run for presidency.

1375
01:13:22.290 --> 01:13:26.360
Him Lose weight to run for president fat acceptance,
the fat acceptance movement.

1376
01:13:26.361 --> 01:13:29.190
I except fat people as friends.
I accept him and all that.

1377
01:13:29.240 --> 01:13:33.180
But there's a reason why you're overweight and whatever it is,

1378
01:13:33.181 --> 01:13:36.780
whether it's hormonal,
whether it's,
you know,
when you have a slow metabolism,

1379
01:13:36.781 --> 01:13:37.410
whatever it is,

1380
01:13:37.410 --> 01:13:41.190
there's food that comes into your body and that's what makes you overweight.

1381
01:13:41.220 --> 01:13:45.210
I mean that it's really that simple.
But you know,
there's a lot of new research,

1382
01:13:45.211 --> 01:13:46.260
like you were saying that,
you know,

1383
01:13:46.261 --> 01:13:50.400
people in utero whose parents are stressed that can have an impact on their

1384
01:13:50.401 --> 01:13:50.740
brain.

1385
01:13:50.740 --> 01:13:55.020
There's also evidence that shows that there's a relationship between in utero

1386
01:13:55.021 --> 01:13:58.210
stuff.
And I can't off the top of my head,
call it up.
I could look it up.
Um,

1387
01:13:58.260 --> 01:14:02.230
that can have an impact on somebody's metabolism and um,
the obedience,

1388
01:14:02.300 --> 01:14:06.450
the third propensity to being obese,
there are cultural factors.

1389
01:14:06.451 --> 01:14:09.030
I think there's societal factors,
but there's also,

1390
01:14:09.060 --> 01:14:12.430
there are also medical and genetic factors at play as well.
Sometimes

1391
01:14:12.430 --> 01:14:15.700
<v 3>people will hide behind the medical genetic factors and claim that the entire</v>

1392
01:14:15.701 --> 01:14:19.660
obesity epidemic is about some sort of mass,
uh,

1393
01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:23.800
morphing,
um,
uh,
genetic.
Uh,
what's the word?

1394
01:14:24.700 --> 01:14:26.800
Darwinism mutation.
Um,

1395
01:14:26.910 --> 01:14:30.220
and we're all suddenly genetically predisposed in a way that we weren't before.

1396
01:14:30.460 --> 01:14:34.240
But there are genetic factors at play and not just a personal factor.

1397
01:14:34.260 --> 01:14:37.620
<v 1>There's a personal factors at play as far as metabolism goes.</v>

1398
01:14:37.621 --> 01:14:41.430
It's some people consume food is digested quicker,

1399
01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:44.430
but the reality is what is the lap band doing with the lap band is doing,

1400
01:14:44.431 --> 01:14:46.500
is interfering with your ability to consume.

1401
01:14:46.850 --> 01:14:51.440
So if you just had the same discipline that the lap band provides you with

1402
01:14:51.990 --> 01:14:52.830
essentially what it's doing,

1403
01:14:53.190 --> 01:14:57.000
the lap band is enforcing a discipline and that discipline has now you don't

1404
01:14:57.001 --> 01:14:59.100
have a choice to whether or not you eat smaller portions.

1405
01:14:59.101 --> 01:15:01.440
You're being forced to eat smaller portions because your stomach is smaller.

1406
01:15:01.470 --> 01:15:03.510
But if somebody doesn't want to get the lap band,

1407
01:15:03.511 --> 01:15:06.780
if somebody who's happy at whatever size they are,
I don't judge them.

1408
01:15:06.810 --> 01:15:10.040
I don't judge them either.
But I do judge them.
And this is why judge them.
I just,

1409
01:15:10.550 --> 01:15:13.200
well I don't judge them as a human being,
but I judge them.

1410
01:15:13.201 --> 01:15:15.300
If you want to be a person who is in control,

1411
01:15:15.510 --> 01:15:18.990
if you want to be a person who is in power,
when someone runs for office,

1412
01:15:18.991 --> 01:15:20.940
you have to judge their character.
You have to judge there will,

1413
01:15:20.941 --> 01:15:23.760
you have to judge their discipline.
See,
I don't have any discipline.

1414
01:15:23.810 --> 01:15:25.410
It's about power.
Well,
yeah.

1415
01:15:25.411 --> 01:15:29.690
Well I mean you think a person without discipline cannot be a person who leads

1416
01:15:29.700 --> 01:15:32.850
the person who leads should be a person that has all their ducks in a row.

1417
01:15:32.960 --> 01:15:33.800
<v 3>I think it's,
there's some,</v>

1418
01:15:33.840 --> 01:15:37.830
maybe there's something here also about class because when you think about,
uh,

1419
01:15:37.890 --> 01:15:42.840
you know,
in societies where food is scarce,
it's better to be bigger.

1420
01:15:42.930 --> 01:15:47.790
That larger is more attractive because it says something about your,
your power.

1421
01:15:47.820 --> 01:15:51.980
It says something about your access to resources and now in,
you know,

1422
01:15:52.040 --> 01:15:56.850
society's swimming in cheap calories.
If you are not obese,

1423
01:15:56.851 --> 01:15:59.220
it says something about your power.
Again,

1424
01:15:59.640 --> 01:16:01.770
it says that you are able to resist this,

1425
01:16:01.771 --> 01:16:05.190
that you have that strength to resist it perhaps,

1426
01:16:05.191 --> 01:16:08.040
and not to succumb to all these cheap and easy calories that are everywhere.

1427
01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:12.420
So I think what you're tapping into there when you say not a leader is you're

1428
01:16:12.421 --> 01:16:16.800
looking for people who are powerful and it is now,
uh,
you know,

1429
01:16:16.860 --> 01:16:21.300
slimness is associated with higher socioeconomic classes and higher education

1430
01:16:21.301 --> 01:16:23.790
levels.
And so I think that's what you're,

1431
01:16:24.290 --> 01:16:28.710
that's informing your opinion perhaps subconsciously about bigger people is that

1432
01:16:28.890 --> 01:16:32.790
obesity is associated with,
uh,
the underclass.

1433
01:16:33.410 --> 01:16:35.240
<v 1>That's not what I'm saying with Chris Christie by far.</v>

1434
01:16:35.241 --> 01:16:37.670
He's obviously has enough money to eat healthy.
That's ridiculous.

1435
01:16:37.880 --> 01:16:39.530
That guy can eat salads all day if he wants to.

1436
01:16:39.560 --> 01:16:42.080
Nothing stopping him economically from any healthy food.

1437
01:16:42.310 --> 01:16:45.530
He's a fat fuck cause he's lazy because he likes to shove things in his Gordon,

1438
01:16:47.750 --> 01:16:51.670
who cares?
What did
people talk?

1439
01:16:51.680 --> 01:16:52.850
If you're a wealthy person,

1440
01:16:52.880 --> 01:16:56.660
if you're a wealthy person and you choose to eat food that makes you obese,

1441
01:16:56.840 --> 01:16:58.730
what's going on there?
You're making a choice.

1442
01:16:58.770 --> 01:17:01.940
Now you can make choices all day to smoke cigarettes and drink booze,

1443
01:17:02.090 --> 01:17:06.380
to do unhealthy things to at all sorts of things.
The lie in the Sun,
who cares?

1444
01:17:06.500 --> 01:17:10.520
But when you become a person that's trying get into a position of leadership,

1445
01:17:10.670 --> 01:17:13.370
<v 2>what is a leader?
A person who you look up to,
they say,</v>

1446
01:17:13.520 --> 01:17:15.950
that guy has got his stuff in order.

1447
01:17:16.040 --> 01:17:19.310
That woman is clearly a person who is exceptional.

1448
01:17:19.400 --> 01:17:23.720
She thinks clearly she's disciplined,
she's compassionate,
she's nice,

1449
01:17:23.900 --> 01:17:26.710
and she's a person that I can be inspired to do support.

1450
01:17:26.711 --> 01:17:29.930
Can't be inspired by that.
When you're a big fat file,
do you support Clinton?

1451
01:17:30.200 --> 01:17:33.680
I support the lesser of two evils.
I met Clinton in the,

1452
01:17:33.950 --> 01:17:38.230
when he was fat and nineties when he was jogging big club soda.

1453
01:17:38.810 --> 01:17:39.770
So why not Christie?

1454
01:17:39.890 --> 01:17:43.850
Because look who was up against Luke who Clinton was up against.
I mean look at,

1455
01:17:43.940 --> 01:17:46.730
look at Bush senior.
Look at it.
If it was a wash,
if it was,

1456
01:17:46.731 --> 01:17:49.210
if there was not a time for the difference between,
uh,

1457
01:17:49.280 --> 01:17:52.220
George Hw Bush and a William Jefferson Clinton,

1458
01:17:52.250 --> 01:17:55.430
you would have voted for George w just on being the skinnier of the two.

1459
01:17:56.030 --> 01:17:58.940
If it was,
well,
you'd have to have a different George h w well,
yeah,

1460
01:17:58.960 --> 01:18:01.250
just totally different human plead equal candidates.

1461
01:18:01.251 --> 01:18:04.910
You have to flip a coin to decide.
One is skinny,
one is before it gets a fat.

1462
01:18:04.940 --> 01:18:07.700
Well,
Clinton was not fat when he was running for president.

1463
01:18:07.701 --> 01:18:12.410
He became fat and I'm sure that pressure and a lot of the,
the,
the,

1464
01:18:12.411 --> 01:18:17.360
the,
I mean he was obviously sexually kinda gluttonous,
you know,
he said,

1465
01:18:18.430 --> 01:18:19.850
yeah man,
have big appetites.

1466
01:18:20.140 --> 01:18:23.460
One of the reasons why a guy like that gets into office in the first place,

1467
01:18:23.461 --> 01:18:27.980
it's because they,
they want what they want to JFK man of appetites,

1468
01:18:27.981 --> 01:18:31.220
sexual appetites,
Franklin Delano Roosevelt,
the big appetites.

1469
01:18:31.480 --> 01:18:35.840
But I think Clinton's benefits where that is extremely intelligent,

1470
01:18:35.841 --> 01:18:40.841
that he had a grasp of foreign policy that he had this way of speaking that was

1471
01:18:42.081 --> 01:18:46.550
very inspiring.
There was a lot of very,
very positive things about Clinton.

1472
01:18:46.550 --> 01:18:49.100
I think he's a brilliant,
brilliant man.
I think that's without question,

1473
01:18:49.430 --> 01:18:53.090
but I think he himself recognized that he had issues with his body and then he

1474
01:18:53.091 --> 01:18:57.170
became a vegetarian or Vegan or Vegan hovers supposed to say that it's supposed

1475
01:18:57.171 --> 01:19:01.910
to be.
Yeah.
I mean it's top,
you know,
weight.

1476
01:19:01.911 --> 01:19:05.450
When he was jogging all the time,
it's still eating cheeseburgers.
I mean,
he was,

1477
01:19:05.451 --> 01:19:08.090
it was kind of a joke,
right?
I mean it was kind of a funny thing,

1478
01:19:08.420 --> 01:19:13.160
but I think that that was constantly picked on for a reason.

1479
01:19:13.340 --> 01:19:16.580
I mean,
it was,
it was something that was laughed at and mocked for reason.

1480
01:19:16.581 --> 01:19:19.100
It's not that you should mock everyone who's fat everywhere you go,

1481
01:19:19.220 --> 01:19:21.260
but I think when you put yourself in a position where you're saying,

1482
01:19:21.710 --> 01:19:25.070
I want to be a leader,
I want to be the person who runs things,
check,

1483
01:19:25.071 --> 01:19:28.640
check me out.
[inaudible]
wait,
disqualifies him.
At least for you.

1484
01:19:28.700 --> 01:19:32.330
Partially because of the discipline thing.
Clinton's wait,

1485
01:19:32.690 --> 01:19:35.600
humanized him.
Otherwise,
he was this road scholar,

1486
01:19:36.140 --> 01:19:39.560
governor of a state in his very early in life,

1487
01:19:39.561 --> 01:19:42.260
kind of political automaton.

1488
01:19:42.290 --> 01:19:46.130
And there was something about Clinton's appetites and I think for food and for

1489
01:19:46.370 --> 01:19:46.761
Pussy,

1490
01:19:46.761 --> 01:19:51.520
which we all knew about and every people kind of had heard Bimbo eruptions and

1491
01:19:51.521 --> 01:19:54.470
shit before.
Uh,
the Bimbo eruptions actually erupted.

1492
01:19:55.310 --> 01:19:59.450
That made him feel like a human being and not just a political machine,

1493
01:19:59.451 --> 01:20:00.290
not just a robot.

1494
01:20:00.590 --> 01:20:04.580
And I think people voted for Clinton in part because of his appetites maybe.

1495
01:20:04.790 --> 01:20:07.950
I think certainly people like people that are soft,
you know,
like

1496
01:20:08.460 --> 01:20:10.380
<v 1>don't make them feel uncomfortable.
Like someone,</v>

1497
01:20:10.410 --> 01:20:13.920
if you get some Uber Marsh who's running for office and he's fucking running up

1498
01:20:13.921 --> 01:20:17.280
hills every day with a weight vest on and he's a fucking animal in the gym and

1499
01:20:17.281 --> 01:20:20.100
you know,
he has strict discipline.
He doesn't put salt on his food.

1500
01:20:20.101 --> 01:20:23.760
No fat in his diet,
drinks only water.
That'll make it a little uncomfortable.

1501
01:20:23.761 --> 01:20:27.430
Yeah.
Like this guy is like,
he's like so driven and disciplined and crazy.

1502
01:20:27.431 --> 01:20:30.060
He might be a psychopath,
might be something wrong with his eye.

1503
01:20:30.130 --> 01:20:33.660
There's no human eye.
He doesn't like cake.
A guy who doesn't like cake.
I can't,

1504
01:20:33.810 --> 01:20:38.610
I can't get behind.
I like cake too.
But look,
it's easy for me to stay thin.

1505
01:20:39.030 --> 01:20:41.910
I've been involved in exercise my entire life.

1506
01:20:42.210 --> 01:20:44.730
I'm very biased when it comes to when I talk about weights,

1507
01:20:45.030 --> 01:20:50.030
but when I see someone who's just blatantly obese and they want to run for

1508
01:20:50.941 --> 01:20:54.540
president or they want to run for office or there they want to put themselves in

1509
01:20:54.541 --> 01:20:57.090
a position of leadership,
you have to judge that

1510
01:20:57.810 --> 01:20:59.910
<v 3>leadership is about ideas and leadership.</v>

1511
01:20:59.940 --> 01:21:04.440
If there was a leader who was morbidly obese and supported,
uh,
you know,

1512
01:21:04.441 --> 01:21:09.441
a revived labor movement and health care for all and urban policies and mass

1513
01:21:09.751 --> 01:21:11.400
transit and doing,
addressing,

1514
01:21:11.430 --> 01:21:14.070
not just addressing but fucking doing something about climate change,

1515
01:21:14.400 --> 01:21:19.020
I would vote for that obese candidate over some shredded idiot who took the

1516
01:21:19.021 --> 01:21:19.854
opposite position on it.

1517
01:21:20.040 --> 01:21:20.340
<v 1>Right?</v>

1518
01:21:20.340 --> 01:21:23.550
But that's a manufactured argument because who's saying that the other guy has

1519
01:21:23.551 --> 01:21:27.660
to be like that you have to have all these great qualities and be fat.

1520
01:21:27.690 --> 01:21:29.700
But if they have all these great qualities and be fat,

1521
01:21:29.701 --> 01:21:33.690
that fat part is the only thing that's wrong with them.
That's great.
Yeah,

1522
01:21:33.750 --> 01:21:34.583
that's wonderful.

1523
01:21:34.590 --> 01:21:39.590
But if you have someone who is like a normal human being that has all sorts of

1524
01:21:39.691 --> 01:21:40.980
issue,
oh there is though.

1525
01:21:41.490 --> 01:21:45.150
It's unhealthy if someone's living so smoking.

1526
01:21:45.170 --> 01:21:49.080
So smoking is a huge flaw.
Obama,
Obama smokes.
I think it's a huge flaw.

1527
01:21:49.290 --> 01:21:52.320
I think it's a huge flaws.
You vote for him?
I voted for,

1528
01:21:52.590 --> 01:21:55.820
I voted for him because I felt like what are the what's,

1529
01:21:55.860 --> 01:22:00.340
what's the possibility of Sarah Pailin becoming president?
What's the possible?

1530
01:22:00.390 --> 01:22:05.010
<v 3>Was He only reason?
What's the Pailin?
Well,</v>

1531
01:22:05.030 --> 01:22:07.470
Mccain was,
he's got a lot of issues.
Talk about you.
You were saying,

1532
01:22:07.480 --> 01:22:10.410
well he's really old and really,
and second of all,
look the,

1533
01:22:10.520 --> 01:22:11.660
you were just saying the judge

1534
01:22:12.150 --> 01:22:13.560
<v 1>two evils argument.</v>

1535
01:22:13.690 --> 01:22:16.770
I thought Obama was going to be way different than what he is in the first
place.

1536
01:22:16.890 --> 01:22:18.300
I have a lot of friends who smoke.
I mean,

1537
01:22:18.301 --> 01:22:19.800
I'm not saying there's anything wrong with smoking.

1538
01:22:19.950 --> 01:22:23.010
It's an easy thing to get caught up in.
It's an easy thing to catch you.

1539
01:22:23.130 --> 01:22:25.740
And the next thing you know,
you can't get rid of it.
You're addicted to it.

1540
01:22:25.890 --> 01:22:29.910
But it is a flaw.
It's absolutely a flaw.
And when you're judging leaders,
look,

1541
01:22:29.911 --> 01:22:32.430
I have flaws.
I'm sure you have floss.
Human beings have flaws,

1542
01:22:32.520 --> 01:22:35.730
but that's a real one.
That's a real one.
And I was sucking on cancer sticks.

1543
01:22:36.490 --> 01:22:40.490
<v 3>There's no benefit.
Nobody hates smoking more than I do.
I've never smoked.</v>

1544
01:22:40.491 --> 01:22:43.810
And I've had a lit cigarette in my hand.
I think it's disgusting.
Okay,

1545
01:22:43.811 --> 01:22:46.260
well let's look at it this way.
If you were going to vote for Obama,
and,

1546
01:22:46.261 --> 01:22:49.300
and I think that,
I think it's unfair to say,
and you know,

1547
01:22:49.301 --> 01:22:52.150
there's a lot of anti-fat workplace discrimination,

1548
01:22:52.360 --> 01:22:55.270
people who are big pay a real economic price.
It has nothing to do with,

1549
01:22:55.271 --> 01:22:59.050
I think with their capabilities of their,
you know,
ability to,
to do a job.

1550
01:22:59.051 --> 01:23:03.550
Most of us do jobs that require us to sit on our asses and type,
uh,
you know,

1551
01:23:03.850 --> 01:23:06.370
we live in an information or a flipping economy and that's it.

1552
01:23:06.700 --> 01:23:11.700
And there's nothing about being a even very large that prevents them from doing

1553
01:23:12.011 --> 01:23:14.590
that.
And I think it's,
and there's a lot of anti,
you know,

1554
01:23:14.591 --> 01:23:16.480
there's a lot of workplace discrimination against big people.

1555
01:23:16.481 --> 01:23:18.760
And I think that your attitude towards not wanting to vote for somebody,

1556
01:23:18.761 --> 01:23:23.650
for presidents because they're big,
is of that anti-fat prejudice,

1557
01:23:23.651 --> 01:23:26.470
that fat acceptance people have total legit complaint about it.

1558
01:23:26.520 --> 01:23:26.761
<v 1>Well,</v>

1559
01:23:26.761 --> 01:23:30.180
that's not really necessarily true because when you look at the statistics as

1560
01:23:30.181 --> 01:23:32.850
far as people that call in sick,
people that have sick days,

1561
01:23:32.851 --> 01:23:37.170
people that show up hours work fat people notoriously Colin's sec more injured,

1562
01:23:37.171 --> 01:23:39.960
more have more issues because their body is unhealthy.

1563
01:23:40.300 --> 01:23:42.070
<v 3>I don't want to see those studies.
I don't know</v>

1564
01:23:42.920 --> 01:23:44.780
<v 1>Google them right now.
Again,
I guarantee you there's,</v>

1565
01:23:44.900 --> 01:23:49.190
I've read many studies on obesity and workplace.
Okay,

1566
01:23:49.210 --> 01:23:52.720
we'll get her and work.

1567
01:23:53.360 --> 01:23:54.860
What would you look up workplace?
What?

1568
01:23:54.960 --> 01:23:56.640
<v 3>Obesity.
Workplace discrimination.</v>

1569
01:23:56.730 --> 01:24:01.730
Now that's obesity and I can't believe I'm having to like do the,

1570
01:24:02.251 --> 01:24:06.720
uh,
the fat acceptance side of this argument because a lot of the fat acceptance

1571
01:24:06.721 --> 01:24:10.590
people hate me because I argued that there's a relationship between consumption

1572
01:24:10.680 --> 01:24:11.430
movement.

1573
01:24:11.430 --> 01:24:13.650
<v 1>Nobody wants to be judged.
I mean,
that's what it is.</v>

1574
01:24:14.850 --> 01:24:19.850
Is Obesity affecting your company's bottom line obesity in the workplace?

1575
01:24:20.430 --> 01:24:22.680
Yeah.
All around the world.

1576
01:24:22.681 --> 01:24:25.170
Companies are constantly facing many different struggles and hardships that are

1577
01:24:25.171 --> 01:24:29.670
triggered by the economy and everyday problems.
Ah,
look,
we could,

1578
01:24:29.700 --> 01:24:30.780
we could have this conversation,

1579
01:24:30.781 --> 01:24:34.140
but I think it probably would get in the way of an actual podcast.

1580
01:24:34.141 --> 01:24:37.620
And anybody wants,
let's talk about sex or something like,
yeah,

1581
01:24:37.770 --> 01:24:38.850
well the problem is we would be,

1582
01:24:38.880 --> 01:24:41.990
would it be googling things and we wouldn't do a great thorough job of,

1583
01:24:41.991 --> 01:24:43.950
of covering it.
And you know,

1584
01:24:44.070 --> 01:24:49.070
I w w also we're running into this situation here where in being honest,

1585
01:24:49.410 --> 01:24:52.260
you worry about hurting people's feelings and you worry about backlash.

1586
01:24:52.261 --> 01:24:54.990
And I know you've faced a bunch of backlash about that.

1587
01:24:55.170 --> 01:24:58.590
You faced a bunch of backlash from transgender,
transgender people.

1588
01:24:58.591 --> 01:24:59.740
You faced a bunch of backlash from,

1589
01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:04.920
so you have to kind of hedge your your points because you worry about this

1590
01:25:04.921 --> 01:25:06.030
backlash.
So you have to,

1591
01:25:06.180 --> 01:25:09.720
but the reality of being overweight is if you had a friend and they were

1592
01:25:09.721 --> 01:25:11.400
overweight and they were willing to listen to you,

1593
01:25:11.730 --> 01:25:15.000
you would say you would be healthier and happier if you lost the weight.

1594
01:25:15.240 --> 01:25:19.440
Is Fat acceptance that you just ignore that?
I mean,
what does fat acceptance,

1595
01:25:19.470 --> 01:25:22.790
you pretend that they're fine.
You pretend that their health,

1596
01:25:23.070 --> 01:25:24.200
<v 3>I can't because it's not health.</v>

1597
01:25:24.201 --> 01:25:26.120
I can't do the fat acceptance side of the argument.

1598
01:25:26.121 --> 01:25:29.660
You should have somebody from the FAA movement on to talk about it.
But if I had,

1599
01:25:29.930 --> 01:25:34.280
if I had a friend who was a big,
you know,

1600
01:25:34.281 --> 01:25:37.820
I wouldn't shame them and I wouldn't guilt them.
But if they ask me for advice,

1601
01:25:37.821 --> 01:25:40.340
I would definitely say,
you know,
whatever size you're going to be,

1602
01:25:40.580 --> 01:25:41.990
the more exercise you get,

1603
01:25:41.991 --> 01:25:45.590
the more you move and the more the decent food you eat,

1604
01:25:45.830 --> 01:25:49.610
just the better year if you feel in your skin and your body,
whatever your sizes.

1605
01:25:49.850 --> 01:25:51.350
I don't question that.
Everybody needs to be.

1606
01:25:51.351 --> 01:25:54.230
Every guy needs to be an Adonis and every woman needs to be a size zero.

1607
01:25:54.650 --> 01:25:59.000
But I do think that if you move more purely sexually,
you know,

1608
01:25:59.001 --> 01:26:00.530
if you move more,
you're gonna have more stamina,

1609
01:26:00.531 --> 01:26:04.070
you have more oxygen in your bloodstream and just you feel better in your own

1610
01:26:04.071 --> 01:26:08.120
skin.
And that's true for me.
If I don't get exercise,
I get depressed,

1611
01:26:08.900 --> 01:26:12.210
depression,
cognitive function.
There's one mother or when she was,
you know,

1612
01:26:12.230 --> 01:26:13.910
not too many years older than I am now,

1613
01:26:14.120 --> 01:26:18.470
started taking antidepressants and I haven't had to start and I don't think I'm

1614
01:26:18.471 --> 01:26:20.000
going to have to start because I'm like my mother.

1615
01:26:20.001 --> 01:26:24.440
I actually get exercise and that is my antidepressant and it does work for

1616
01:26:24.441 --> 01:26:27.260
people,
but not everybody has the time or the space or the inclination.

1617
01:26:27.440 --> 01:26:30.920
I think people should do what makes them happy.
If you want to smoke,
smoke,

1618
01:26:30.921 --> 01:26:33.500
if you want to smoke pot,
smoke pot.
If you want to use coke,
I think you're crazy.

1619
01:26:33.501 --> 01:26:37.940
But go ahead.
If you,
if you find pleasure in,
in food,

1620
01:26:37.941 --> 01:26:40.850
if you are a Gourmand,
if you,
if you are,
if you are,

1621
01:26:41.720 --> 01:26:46.720
what does that someone who lives to eat and finds exquisite pleasure and in

1622
01:26:46.810 --> 01:26:50.690
dining and,
and you want,
and this is,
this is what you want to uh,

1623
01:26:50.960 --> 01:26:52.590
build your life around because,

1624
01:26:53.070 --> 01:26:55.730
because this is what gives you pleasure and that's what we're all here on this

1625
01:26:55.731 --> 01:26:58.520
planet doing.
Like finding those things that give us pleasure pursuing happiness.

1626
01:26:58.890 --> 01:27:03.050
Um,
great.
Do it.
The only objection I ever make is when,

1627
01:27:03.051 --> 01:27:07.220
then I have to pretend that the sky is green and the grass is blue and there

1628
01:27:07.221 --> 01:27:11.210
isn't a relationship between calories in movement and size.

1629
01:27:11.211 --> 01:27:15.440
So we're in agreement except I would vote for somebody who was cause I think

1630
01:27:15.530 --> 01:27:17.570
that's irrelevant when it comes to these irrelevant.

1631
01:27:17.630 --> 01:27:21.170
If that person got into the office and they were unhealthy and depressed because

1632
01:27:21.171 --> 01:27:25.220
they're obese,
what do you think that would have a thought of?
Affection.

1633
01:27:25.280 --> 01:27:28.880
Unhealthy and depressed doesn't correlate only with obesity.

1634
01:27:29.240 --> 01:27:31.070
You would have to know all sorts of other things about,

1635
01:27:31.071 --> 01:27:32.330
so you're going back to early.

1636
01:27:32.331 --> 01:27:34.970
You'd have to know how stressed out their mother was when they were carrying the

1637
01:27:34.971 --> 01:27:37.350
baby in Utero to know if they are hair trigger.

1638
01:27:37.351 --> 01:27:38.530
Do you want somebody with a hair trigger?

1639
01:27:38.570 --> 01:27:41.000
You were with the nuclear correlating those two things.

1640
01:27:41.001 --> 01:27:43.580
You were just a correlating obesity and depression.

1641
01:27:43.581 --> 01:27:45.140
You were just core a core correlating,

1642
01:27:45.150 --> 01:27:49.730
no correlate a city movement and depression,
exercise and depression.

1643
01:27:49.850 --> 01:27:51.350
One of the fringe benefits of exercise,

1644
01:27:51.351 --> 01:27:53.870
you'll probably be less obese or you lose weight,

1645
01:27:54.230 --> 01:27:58.160
but I think it's the endorphins and the movement and the oxygen pumping through

1646
01:27:58.161 --> 01:28:02.360
your system.
Not Everybody who exercises is some people are exercise and are,
are,

1647
01:28:02.361 --> 01:28:06.240
are very fit.
Our bigger people I have,
I have,
I have an uncle,

1648
01:28:06.470 --> 01:28:10.790
I have an uncle who bikes 20 miles a day back and forth to work.

1649
01:28:10.820 --> 01:28:14.210
If he's a fat guy,
what does he,
some people are coded to be big.

1650
01:28:14.211 --> 01:28:15.160
There were people house,

1651
01:28:15.650 --> 01:28:19.010
you can give them a lap band and all of a sudden they shrink down there.

1652
01:28:19.170 --> 01:28:23.310
Have smaller portions.
The lap,
I can't believe,

1653
01:28:23.890 --> 01:28:27.770
I can't believe I'm here trying to take this position.
It's really cute.

1654
01:28:27.800 --> 01:28:31.910
It's cute to watch.
I could see the blowback that you've experienced.

1655
01:28:31.911 --> 01:28:35.430
I'll throw your life and God speaking your opinion that don't getting mad at
you.

1656
01:28:35.460 --> 01:28:38.270
Trying to have a more nuanced position that I did when people were mad at me.

1657
01:28:38.271 --> 01:28:43.040
I'm not conceding ground on calories in movement size being related,

1658
01:28:43.310 --> 01:28:47.570
but,
and there is an obesity epidemic.
I do think it's tied,
uh,

1659
01:28:47.660 --> 01:28:52.280
largely to,
um,
societal sitters,
corn syrup,

1660
01:28:52.310 --> 01:28:56.540
Sedentary Lifestyles,
uh,
laziness,
um,

1661
01:28:56.660 --> 01:28:58.880
that can be learned and can be unlearned.

1662
01:28:59.210 --> 01:29:02.070
But also there are some people who are their bodies naturally

1663
01:29:02.070 --> 01:29:04.860
<v 2>set to a larger weight.
There are a lot of people who claim that they are,</v>

1664
01:29:04.861 --> 01:29:08.970
those people who are not,
they're just eating poorly.
They're just Chris Christie.

1665
01:29:09.390 --> 01:29:12.480
Um,
but there are people who retain and this is,
you know,

1666
01:29:12.481 --> 01:29:14.880
this is another place are getting in trouble because I want to say,
you know,

1667
01:29:14.881 --> 01:29:18.030
my husband has a metabolism like,
uh,

1668
01:29:18.040 --> 01:29:22.320
like a hive of wasps.
He just burns everything.
I don't know why I was,

1669
01:29:22.350 --> 01:29:25.950
would make sense with that hummingbird banding.
Yeah.
He just,
he can,

1670
01:29:25.951 --> 01:29:30.420
he can sit down and eat four pints of ice cream and not gain any weight.
I can't.

1671
01:29:30.720 --> 01:29:34.830
So I don't,
and when you talk to some people in the fat acceptance movement,

1672
01:29:34.831 --> 01:29:35.770
they talk about,
you know,

1673
01:29:35.850 --> 01:29:39.390
consumption as if it should be fair as opposed to something you have to be self

1674
01:29:39.391 --> 01:29:41.250
aware about.
And like,
I don't want to be big,

1675
01:29:41.251 --> 01:29:45.930
so I watch my husband have dessert half the time.
I don't have it myself.

1676
01:29:46.080 --> 01:29:48.210
Did nothing's fair when it comes to biology.

1677
01:29:48.240 --> 01:29:50.340
Why is it fair that some people have giant noses?

1678
01:29:50.520 --> 01:29:54.060
Why is it fair that some people are born?
Yeah,
well there's no fair at any of it.

1679
01:29:54.240 --> 01:29:56.670
Some people are born deaf,
there's nothing fair.
You know,

1680
01:29:56.671 --> 01:29:58.200
if you are born with a slow metabolism,

1681
01:29:58.201 --> 01:30:00.420
that as a reality of the hand that you've been dealt,
you know?

1682
01:30:00.421 --> 01:30:02.250
And if you choose to say,
you know what,

1683
01:30:02.400 --> 01:30:06.150
I like food more than I like being healthy or a like food more than I like being

1684
01:30:06.151 --> 01:30:08.780
thin.
That's fine.
I mean that's your choice.
I'm not,

1685
01:30:08.781 --> 01:30:11.790
not saying that you shouldn't be able to make that choice,

1686
01:30:12.060 --> 01:30:15.660
but I am saying that if you look at someone that's running for an office or

1687
01:30:15.661 --> 01:30:16.680
wants to be a leader,

1688
01:30:16.681 --> 01:30:21.420
want to be an example and you have this glaring flaw is glaring flaw that you

1689
01:30:21.421 --> 01:30:26.290
kinda gluttonous with the way
that you can take into account.
Um,

1690
01:30:26.360 --> 01:30:31.260
but I think,
I honestly think it's irrelevant.
It's not irrelevant.
It's a factor.

1691
01:30:31.290 --> 01:30:34.890
It might not be the only factor,
but it's certainly a factor if you,

1692
01:30:34.891 --> 01:30:38.880
if a guy just can't wait to end is meaning so he could stuff pinders phase.

1693
01:30:39.210 --> 01:30:41.670
What about the people who say that Clinton,
uh,
you know,

1694
01:30:41.671 --> 01:30:43.950
because he fucked Monica Lewinsky,
you know,

1695
01:30:43.951 --> 01:30:47.280
a politician who cheated on his wife can't be trusted not to cheat the country.

1696
01:30:47.810 --> 01:30:49.050
That's a silly argument,
right?

1697
01:30:49.051 --> 01:30:52.710
So it's a silly argument to say somebody who's undisciplined around food won't

1698
01:30:52.711 --> 01:30:57.711
be disciplined enough to be a decent governor who oversees a decent

1699
01:30:57.781 --> 01:31:00.270
administration that an ex decent policies that benefit.

1700
01:31:00.271 --> 01:31:03.010
But no one's saying that he wouldn't be,
we're saying is this,

1701
01:31:03.210 --> 01:31:05.490
you have to judge him based on the whole,

1702
01:31:05.700 --> 01:31:07.110
if you judge someone based on the whole,

1703
01:31:07.111 --> 01:31:09.000
is that an example that you would want as a leader,

1704
01:31:09.270 --> 01:31:13.230
a person who can't get their shit together as far as their body?
I don't,
I don't.

1705
01:31:13.950 --> 01:31:16.830
There are people who can't keep their dicks in their pants and I think that's

1706
01:31:16.831 --> 01:31:18.600
irrelevant to whether they're going to be a good president.

1707
01:31:19.110 --> 01:31:22.930
FDR was a pretty good president and the evidence is clear that he was not just

1708
01:31:22.931 --> 01:31:26.190
the sleeping with Eleanor.
If he ever did after awhile,
uh,

1709
01:31:26.280 --> 01:31:31.280
and good president JFK was fucking everything and people believe he was a pretty

1710
01:31:31.471 --> 01:31:32.304
good president.

1711
01:31:32.670 --> 01:31:35.700
Sidestep nuclear annihilation for which we should all be grateful.
Uh,

1712
01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:40.590
I think it's irrelevant.
And if that sort of,
uh,

1713
01:31:40.620 --> 01:31:45.620
appetite around sex doesn't tell us that someone isn't qualified to be a decent

1714
01:31:46.351 --> 01:31:47.520
politician and a good leader,

1715
01:31:47.640 --> 01:31:51.370
that kind of appetite around food doesn't tell us anything about whether they're

1716
01:31:51.371 --> 01:31:52.590
going to be a good leader or not either,

1717
01:31:52.770 --> 01:31:55.050
but isn't a person who is running for president?

1718
01:31:55.051 --> 01:31:57.930
Like it wasn't one of the issues that a lot of people have with Obama smoking

1719
01:31:57.931 --> 01:31:59.290
and that it sets a bad example.

1720
01:31:59.290 --> 01:32:02.200
If the president of United States can't quit smoking like Jesus Christ,

1721
01:32:02.201 --> 01:32:05.590
I hate that moral example.
What exam setting?
An example.

1722
01:32:05.710 --> 01:32:10.290
That's why Anthony Wiener had to be out of uh,
Congress.
Oh,

1723
01:32:10.300 --> 01:32:13.900
think of the children of a liar.
That's the,
there's a lot going on there,

1724
01:32:13.901 --> 01:32:15.230
but it's not even just thinking that she'll,

1725
01:32:15.280 --> 01:32:18.490
that example is white Ginsburg isn't on the Supreme Court.
Yeah,

1726
01:32:18.500 --> 01:32:20.890
but we've talking about something irrelevant like marijuana.

1727
01:32:20.891 --> 01:32:22.990
We were talking about something that gives you cancer,
like cigarettes.

1728
01:32:22.991 --> 01:32:24.760
This is this.
It's a,
it's a health issue.

1729
01:32:24.880 --> 01:32:29.320
If kids see marijuana has kids packs marijuana.
Like what?
Name one.

1730
01:32:29.920 --> 01:32:33.280
It makes me slow and stupid.
Please.
That's ridiculous.

1731
01:32:33.340 --> 01:32:34.750
If you're slow slowing stupid,

1732
01:32:34.751 --> 01:32:37.570
you're slow and stupid because you smoked too much pot and it'll go away.

1733
01:32:37.571 --> 01:32:40.190
You are not a healthy knock in your brain around a little bit.
No,

1734
01:32:40.210 --> 01:32:43.420
you don't smoke pot.
You're not,
you're not.
There's no,
there's no studies,

1735
01:32:44.620 --> 01:32:45.640
no studies whatsoever.

1736
01:32:45.641 --> 01:32:50.410
They've shown any cognitive negative side effects of marijuana that are real

1737
01:32:50.590 --> 01:32:54.580
during teenage years.
Well,
during formative years,
you shouldn't drink alcohol.

1738
01:32:54.581 --> 01:32:57.520
You shouldn't fucking hold your breath.
You should eat whip it.

1739
01:32:57.521 --> 01:33:01.120
The argument against Ginsburg to the Supreme Court because he smoked a joint was

1740
01:33:01.121 --> 01:33:03.580
he was setting a bad example for those kids.
But it's a bad,

1741
01:33:03.581 --> 01:33:07.450
there are demonstrable,
uh,
harms to smoking,

1742
01:33:07.451 --> 01:33:10.870
but it's not true because there's no,
nothing has ever been shown.
And all these,

1743
01:33:11.020 --> 01:33:12.850
look,
there's a big article that just came out recently.

1744
01:33:12.851 --> 01:33:16.900
The DEA spent four decades suppressing information about the positive benefits

1745
01:33:16.901 --> 01:33:19.540
of marijuana.
All of the positive effects of marijuana,

1746
01:33:19.650 --> 01:33:23.470
far it's shrinking tumors as far as actually improving people that have had

1747
01:33:23.471 --> 01:33:27.700
traumatic brain injuries.
There's a lot of pump.
But for pot,
I smoked pot.

1748
01:33:27.730 --> 01:33:30.340
But you're,
so you're why you using Ginsburg as an example?

1749
01:33:30.340 --> 01:33:31.510
I'm not using Ginsburg and example.

1750
01:33:31.511 --> 01:33:36.511
I'm saying that you just said that weight around politicians talking about,

1751
01:33:36.730 --> 01:33:41.410
we're talking about cigarettes.
That's a bad example for the kids,
right?
Well,

1752
01:33:41.740 --> 01:33:45.010
pot use,
that was the argument against Ginsburg member,

1753
01:33:45.060 --> 01:33:47.110
but it's based on ignorance.
It's not based on ignorance.

1754
01:33:47.111 --> 01:33:48.070
When you talking about cigarettes,

1755
01:33:48.071 --> 01:33:52.870
cigarettes actually do no cigarettes kill 500,000 people every year,

1756
01:33:53.160 --> 01:33:56.750
right?
No,
marijuana is cigarettes are the much greater evil.
I'm a pothead.

1757
01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:02.530
I see.
Let's just not evil being there on his evils hammers.

1758
01:34:02.540 --> 01:34:05.470
Are you not saying because people kill with him.
Not saying marijuana is evil.

1759
01:34:05.770 --> 01:34:10.770
There are studies and and sound science that shows that marijuana,

1760
01:34:11.360 --> 01:34:13.830
the developing adolescent brain,
we could look it up right now.
Okay.

1761
01:34:13.880 --> 01:34:18.040
The developing adolescent brain is a different about whether it's a good
example.

1762
01:34:18.041 --> 01:34:19.900
Who are we talking about when we say something?
It's a bad example.

1763
01:34:19.900 --> 01:34:21.070
We're talking about the kitties.

1764
01:34:21.220 --> 01:34:25.240
That was the argument used to keep Ginsburg off the supreme court that his pot

1765
01:34:25.241 --> 01:34:27.730
use was going to send the wrong message to kids.

1766
01:34:27.910 --> 01:34:30.220
That's what you're just talking about with cigarettes and the president.

1767
01:34:30.221 --> 01:34:35.221
Here's the problem with anybody saying that marijuana gives a bad is bad for the

1768
01:34:35.590 --> 01:34:38.650
formative years of children.
You're not testing kids and saying,
okay,

1769
01:34:38.651 --> 01:34:41.220
we're going to take a bunch of kids that are healthy and normal and we're going

1770
01:34:41.221 --> 01:34:42.340
to have a study group.

1771
01:34:42.341 --> 01:34:45.190
We're going to give the marijuana and we're going to have people that are equal

1772
01:34:45.191 --> 01:34:48.280
in their cognitive abilities.
Do I want to give them no,
no,
no marijuana.

1773
01:34:48.360 --> 01:34:49.060
We don't have that.

1774
01:34:49.060 --> 01:34:53.550
So we don't have is a bunch of people that have issues and you'd that have

1775
01:34:53.560 --> 01:34:56.620
issues and he says,
oh well they do marijuana.
Well,
Gee,

1776
01:34:56.800 --> 01:34:59.930
is marijuana the cause of the issues?
Are there a bunch of factors?

1777
01:35:00.050 --> 01:35:02.870
Are they depressed?
Do they have mental illness issues?

1778
01:35:02.871 --> 01:35:05.300
Is something running in their family?
Holier codes?

1779
01:35:05.390 --> 01:35:10.010
I have a 17 six and four do you want it to 17 year olds smoking pot right now?

1780
01:35:10.160 --> 01:35:12.770
I don't have a problem with it.
Yeah,
I don't think it's an issue.

1781
01:35:13.250 --> 01:35:15.560
I think alcohol is a bit much bigger issue.
I agree.

1782
01:35:15.620 --> 01:35:20.060
I wrote that in a book that I don't think it's 15 I'd rather he was smoking pot

1783
01:35:20.360 --> 01:35:22.690
than drinking.
I don't think kids should,

1784
01:35:22.720 --> 01:35:27.470
a drug that takes the edge off as opposed to puts the edge on alcohol makes kids

1785
01:35:27.471 --> 01:35:29.090
boys particularly aggressive.

1786
01:35:29.660 --> 01:35:32.870
And we know this from the same sorts of bullshit studies that you would slam for

1787
01:35:32.871 --> 01:35:37.310
pot.
No,
no,
we don't do,
we don't do controlled studies,

1788
01:35:37.850 --> 01:35:41.480
medical studies on humans,
so we don't have evidence,
uh,

1789
01:35:41.630 --> 01:35:45.230
the same sort of evidence that we have for other things that we can do

1790
01:35:45.231 --> 01:35:48.200
controlled studies on a control group,
cell studies.

1791
01:35:48.890 --> 01:35:53.890
But there is a confluence of evidence that pot is for the developing adolescent

1792
01:35:55.101 --> 01:35:59.570
brain,
not the greatest idea.
And maybe with art children's brains,

1793
01:35:59.571 --> 01:36:03.800
we should err on the side of caution and encourage them to maybe wait for pot

1794
01:36:03.830 --> 01:36:06.760
for after their brains are fully formed.
Hypothalamus,

1795
01:36:06.990 --> 01:36:11.300
it interferes with judgment around risk taking according to the studies that I

1796
01:36:11.301 --> 01:36:14.790
have read.
Yeah.
The studies that,
again,
we talked about this,
the,
the,
the,

1797
01:36:14.800 --> 01:36:18.200
the real issue is these children already have issues.
They're issues.

1798
01:36:18.201 --> 01:36:21.680
The correlation between marijuana may or may not be the reason why they got into

1799
01:36:21.681 --> 01:36:24.680
this situation,
that it has the same cultural effects that marijuana has.

1800
01:36:24.720 --> 01:36:27.680
Has that impact can't,
it can be just sort of like,

1801
01:36:28.430 --> 01:36:32.320
we can just dismiss it as not being impactful.
We use marijuana.
We,

1802
01:36:32.490 --> 01:36:34.850
we use marijuana because it's impact.
Yes.

1803
01:36:34.880 --> 01:36:38.510
But do you know how many kids smoked pot in high school and our fucking fine

1804
01:36:38.550 --> 01:36:43.420
guys.
Gigantic.
I know,
I tell myself that every day.
Uh,
numbers checked,

1805
01:36:43.490 --> 01:36:47.880
fingers crossed.
I really don't think that that's nearly the issue.
I was 34,

1806
01:36:47.990 --> 01:36:51.260
but I know most other people don't.
Including,
you know,
I have friends who are,

1807
01:36:52.010 --> 01:36:52.880
who are,

1808
01:36:53.750 --> 01:36:57.620
whose careers I will not mention lest I identify them.
Uh,

1809
01:36:57.920 --> 01:36:59.870
who haven't spoken pot since they were 12.

1810
01:36:59.871 --> 01:37:04.871
I don't think that being a teenage pot smoker means you're going to be a wasted

1811
01:37:05.001 --> 01:37:09.470
loser as an adult.
So what are you saying?
I am saying it's tough on the brain.

1812
01:37:09.620 --> 01:37:12.350
I don't know if it is.
I don't know if it is.
I really don't.

1813
01:37:12.351 --> 01:37:16.340
I mean I think anything we you abuse talked about talking about versus abuse.

1814
01:37:16.341 --> 01:37:18.740
You talk about skewed samples.
I think,
you know,

1815
01:37:18.741 --> 01:37:21.740
when I think about my own son and I think about,
you know,

1816
01:37:22.580 --> 01:37:25.840
whether what he might be doing or what he is doing,
um,

1817
01:37:26.090 --> 01:37:27.830
I always reassure myself with,
you know,

1818
01:37:27.831 --> 01:37:31.100
I know this person was smoking pot all through high school and middle school and

1819
01:37:31.101 --> 01:37:35.900
this person and that person,
everybody I know so many of them are,
you know,

1820
01:37:35.901 --> 01:37:38.690
we're using pot in high school,
Middle School,
and they're fine.
And then everyone.

1821
01:37:38.700 --> 01:37:39.740
So I think,
yeah,

1822
01:37:39.741 --> 01:37:42.920
but the guys who are using pot in middle school and high school aren't fine.

1823
01:37:43.190 --> 01:37:47.600
I wouldn't know them as a natal,
they wouldn't be part of my sphere as an adult.

1824
01:37:47.601 --> 01:37:51.230
So I don't have a representative sample of the impact of pot on the adolescent

1825
01:37:51.231 --> 01:37:55.160
brain because the people I know who are successful,
who smoked pot,

1826
01:37:55.290 --> 01:37:59.370
they were a middle school students and high school students are fine because the

1827
01:37:59.371 --> 01:38:03.420
people who smoked pot who derailed their lives or it did have some negative

1828
01:38:03.421 --> 01:38:06.360
impact,
they're not anybody I would ever meet.

1829
01:38:09.050 --> 01:38:12.860
Right.
I don't know what you're saying.
The people that derailed their life,

1830
01:38:12.861 --> 01:38:17.120
you wouldn't meet them.
They wouldn't,
you know,
I the,
I am a successful person.

1831
01:38:17.121 --> 01:38:19.310
I hang out with like responsible,
sane,

1832
01:38:19.370 --> 01:38:22.290
successful people who have their shit together.
Right?

1833
01:38:22.340 --> 01:38:26.150
I don't hang out with people who don't have their shit together so that I

1834
01:38:26.151 --> 01:38:30.350
reassure myself about adolescent drug use as I parent and adolescent because

1835
01:38:30.351 --> 01:38:33.590
everybody I know who's an adult who is an adolescent drug user is fine,

1836
01:38:33.950 --> 01:38:35.900
only goes so far because everybody,

1837
01:38:35.960 --> 01:38:38.570
I don't know who was an adolescent drug use here isn't fine.

1838
01:38:38.571 --> 01:38:42.590
I wouldn't know those people.
So I don't have a fully representative sample.

1839
01:38:43.040 --> 01:38:47.420
My study of like everybody I know is fine isn't any more scientifically sound

1840
01:38:47.421 --> 01:38:50.900
than the studies of pot use and its impact on adolescents that you're
condemning?

1841
01:38:50.930 --> 01:38:55.070
Well,
I think you can be really clear that anytime you're altering consciousness,

1842
01:38:55.130 --> 01:38:58.610
you,
you run risks and you have rewards,
there's positive benefits,

1843
01:38:58.611 --> 01:39:02.360
there's negatives and it can be argued that there are positive benefits to

1844
01:39:02.361 --> 01:39:05.540
altering your consciousness when you were young because it forces you to step

1845
01:39:05.541 --> 01:39:09.410
outside of the predetermined pattern of behavior that's been prescribed to you

1846
01:39:09.411 --> 01:39:13.430
by society and culture.
And it gives you a chance to,
as a young person,

1847
01:39:13.640 --> 01:39:15.410
look at this world that you live in and go,
you know what?

1848
01:39:15.411 --> 01:39:17.720
I don't want to be my fucking parents.
I don't know how to be that teacher.

1849
01:39:17.721 --> 01:39:20.060
That's an asshole.
I don't want to be the principal.
I,

1850
01:39:20.070 --> 01:39:24.620
I want to figure out what it is about what they're telling me that's true and

1851
01:39:24.621 --> 01:39:28.490
what it is about this life that we live that is just operating on momentum.

1852
01:39:28.491 --> 01:39:32.000
And that is something that marijuana provides young people and I don't think

1853
01:39:32.001 --> 01:39:33.200
it's something they should abuse.

1854
01:39:33.350 --> 01:39:34.880
And I don't think it's something that should be,

1855
01:39:34.910 --> 01:39:38.690
anybody should smoke on a regular basis,
on a daily basis all day.

1856
01:39:38.870 --> 01:39:42.890
I think that clouding your reality consistently and constantly,

1857
01:39:42.891 --> 01:39:46.910
whether it's with mushrooms or marijuana,
it becomes a very,
very slippery thing.

1858
01:39:46.911 --> 01:39:48.800
And I think it's not good for consciousness.

1859
01:39:48.950 --> 01:39:53.060
I think consciousness can be enhanced by adding psychedelics to it,

1860
01:39:53.061 --> 01:39:57.860
whether it's psychotropic plants,
medicines,
meditation,
Yoga,

1861
01:39:57.861 --> 01:40:00.290
all those different things have psychedelic effects.

1862
01:40:00.470 --> 01:40:03.710
And one of the things about psychedelic effects is the reset option.

1863
01:40:03.920 --> 01:40:07.040
The option to go there,
do something,

1864
01:40:07.130 --> 01:40:11.360
have this ability to step outside of the pattern that you find yourself right

1865
01:40:11.570 --> 01:40:14.210
now that hasn't happened.
One cigarettes and that does cigarettes just,

1866
01:40:14.300 --> 01:40:16.760
and that's why this argument is disingenuous.

1867
01:40:16.761 --> 01:40:20.870
The cigarette thing about being a bad example,
there's zero fucking benefits.

1868
01:40:20.871 --> 01:40:24.770
The sucking on a thing that kills half a million people a year.
Costs money,

1869
01:40:24.771 --> 01:40:25.670
smells like shit.

1870
01:40:25.820 --> 01:40:28.880
When you see a guy like the president who smoked cigarettes and you say,

1871
01:40:28.881 --> 01:40:32.480
well that guy is up setting a bad example.
I think that's pretty fucking valid.

1872
01:40:32.720 --> 01:40:36.560
And if the president had smoked marijuana sometime in his life,
like Ginsburg,

1873
01:40:36.710 --> 01:40:39.020
and in a way,
guess he's admitted that he talks about it,

1874
01:40:39.050 --> 01:40:40.040
I don't think it's as big a deal.

1875
01:40:40.070 --> 01:40:45.050
You know what I think is the worst example in the president's cases that he

1876
01:40:45.051 --> 01:40:46.900
smoked pot,
didn't get caught,

1877
01:40:46.910 --> 01:40:49.700
didn't get caught up in the criminal justice system as a young African American

1878
01:40:49.701 --> 01:40:52.860
male and treats marijuana decriminalization once he becomes president.

1879
01:40:52.861 --> 01:40:53.694
And some big joke,

1880
01:40:54.190 --> 01:40:56.500
<v 3>I don't.
Yeah.
When it could have destroyed his life.</v>

1881
01:40:56.560 --> 01:41:01.120
The punitive racist anti drug policies that we have in this country could have

1882
01:41:01.121 --> 01:41:03.130
destroyed his life.
And as soon as he,
you know,

1883
01:41:03.131 --> 01:41:07.240
he gets elected president as having been an out pot smoker and acts like any

1884
01:41:07.241 --> 01:41:11.320
suggestion about marijuana decriminalization or reform is beneath contempt and

1885
01:41:11.321 --> 01:41:13.720
shouldn't be considered.
And he says because of the kids,

1886
01:41:14.410 --> 01:41:18.790
that hypocrisy of the president's around pot is so much more offensive to me

1887
01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:23.740
than the president's idiocy around getting addicted to cigarettes.
I agree.

1888
01:41:23.741 --> 01:41:25.580
And I think it speaks to the

1889
01:41:25.730 --> 01:41:28.490
<v 1>common thoughts of the people.
I mean if you looked at,</v>

1890
01:41:28.580 --> 01:41:32.750
if you wanted to pull people and tried to appease the people,

1891
01:41:32.930 --> 01:41:34.250
you would say something like that.

1892
01:41:34.280 --> 01:41:36.410
Like the president said that it's speaking to the children,

1893
01:41:36.411 --> 01:41:38.750
worrying about the children.
That's a good thing to do.

1894
01:41:38.780 --> 01:41:40.130
If you want to be a politician,

1895
01:41:40.340 --> 01:41:43.880
if you want to not speak your mind and not be honest and support the facts,

1896
01:41:44.030 --> 01:41:48.350
but instead go with the flow and that's what the flow of this country is.
This,

1897
01:41:48.360 --> 01:41:50.150
the country is still worried about the flow,

1898
01:41:50.151 --> 01:41:54.410
but prop up a system that could have destroyed you.
Absolutely.
Yeah.

1899
01:41:54.440 --> 01:41:58.490
Without a doubt.
No argument there.
I mean,
look,
the drug policies that we have,

1900
01:41:58.670 --> 01:42:01.430
and they're not just racist,
they're ridiculous.
I mean,

1901
01:42:01.610 --> 01:42:04.640
we don't have a society that avoids drugs.

1902
01:42:04.670 --> 01:42:07.280
We don't have a drug free society by any stretch of the imagination.

1903
01:42:07.280 --> 01:42:11.240
We have a society where you could drive down this fucking street in every single

1904
01:42:11.241 --> 01:42:15.110
restaurant served drugs,
every single one.
Go to cvs.

1905
01:42:15.111 --> 01:42:17.630
You could drink yourself to death.
You just walk right in to cvs,

1906
01:42:17.840 --> 01:42:20.510
buy a gallon of Jack Daniel's,
drink it all in one shot.

1907
01:42:20.511 --> 01:42:23.600
You're a fucking dead man.
You could go to that pill counter.

1908
01:42:23.720 --> 01:42:26.900
And if you have the right doctor,
he can prescribe you the right medication.

1909
01:42:26.901 --> 01:42:31.490
You fucking suck the whole bottle down with a shot of whiskey and your argument

1910
01:42:31.900 --> 01:42:35.030
done.
So this idea of a drug free societies,
preposterous.

1911
01:42:35.031 --> 01:42:38.420
I had Dr. Carl Hart on who's a,
an expert in addiction.

1912
01:42:38.421 --> 01:42:41.450
And one of the things that he said that's so important is not only will we never

1913
01:42:41.451 --> 01:42:45.380
have a drug free society,
you don't want a drug free society,
you don't want it.

1914
01:42:46.170 --> 01:42:49.340
And it's just the idea of people drugs.
Well it's not just that,

1915
01:42:49.341 --> 01:42:52.120
it's the idea of sanction drugs as opposed to,
you know,

1916
01:42:52.250 --> 01:42:55.880
an unsanctioned drugs like who,
what is the benefit of these sanction drugs?

1917
01:42:55.881 --> 01:42:56.670
And if you look at it,

1918
01:42:56.670 --> 01:43:00.470
it's clear there's an economic motive to have some drug sanctioned in some not.

1919
01:43:00.560 --> 01:43:02.810
If that wasn't the case,
well God damn it.

1920
01:43:03.050 --> 01:43:05.510
Wouldn't the fucking president be complaining about cigarettes?

1921
01:43:05.511 --> 01:43:08.150
Wouldn't politicians to be saying we're going to outlaw cigarettes cause you're

1922
01:43:08.151 --> 01:43:12.140
dealing with a drug that kills a massive amount of people in this country.

1923
01:43:12.141 --> 01:43:15.320
It prematurely half a million people a year just in this country.

1924
01:43:15.321 --> 01:43:18.650
Millions worldwide wouldn't,
uh,
president step up.

1925
01:43:18.770 --> 01:43:20.270
Wouldn't someone who's running for office,

1926
01:43:20.271 --> 01:43:23.300
someone who's in a position of leadership say something against that.

1927
01:43:23.390 --> 01:43:25.880
The reason why they don't is economics.
It's really simple.

1928
01:43:26.030 --> 01:43:29.870
The reason why nicotine is not sanction drug is purely because of x

1929
01:43:30.080 --> 01:43:34.430
<v 3>economics and the selective selectively learned lessons of prohibition.</v>

1930
01:43:34.730 --> 01:43:36.680
We can't ban cigarettes.
We,
we did,

1931
01:43:36.681 --> 01:43:41.150
we banned alcohol because it was bad for people led to family breakups and

1932
01:43:41.151 --> 01:43:45.920
violence and Serosa deliberate,
organized many,
many millions of dots and we,

1933
01:43:45.921 --> 01:43:46.131
you know,

1934
01:43:46.131 --> 01:43:49.490
had alcohol prohibition and it fueled organized crime and people drank anyway.

1935
01:43:49.610 --> 01:43:52.250
So prohibition doesn't work.
So one's gonna Argue for the prohibition

1936
01:43:52.250 --> 01:43:54.020
<v 1>of cigarettes wouldn't work for the exact same reasons.</v>

1937
01:43:54.230 --> 01:43:57.530
And then you ask those same people about drug prohibition and they go,
what,
what,

1938
01:43:57.800 --> 01:44:00.560
don't don't,
it doesn't compute.
Right.
So the,
you know,

1939
01:44:00.561 --> 01:44:04.010
the same argument that you would make for legalizing pot and probably other

1940
01:44:04.011 --> 01:44:06.950
drugs,
uh,
prevents you from banning cigarettes.

1941
01:44:07.060 --> 01:44:09.110
I think this goes back to what we were talking about earlier,

1942
01:44:09.111 --> 01:44:13.790
that we live in a world where information is readily accessible and we live in

1943
01:44:13.791 --> 01:44:17.600
that world very briefly.
This has only been around for a couple of decades.

1944
01:44:17.900 --> 01:44:19.270
1994 ish.

1945
01:44:19.310 --> 01:44:22.790
When the Internet came along really probably in the two thousands when people

1946
01:44:22.791 --> 01:44:26.390
started really accessing and on a regular basis and using search search engines

1947
01:44:26.391 --> 01:44:28.070
and finding answers to questions.

1948
01:44:28.400 --> 01:44:31.840
All these people that are basing all of these ideas that they have there,

1949
01:44:31.841 --> 01:44:34.940
they're based on the momentum of an ignorant past.
I mean,

1950
01:44:34.941 --> 01:44:37.250
that's essentially what we're,
we're,
we're dealing with.

1951
01:44:37.400 --> 01:44:40.760
So I think that what we're dealing with right now with this scramble to try to

1952
01:44:40.761 --> 01:44:43.610
figure out what should be legal and what shouldn't be legal and why is this

1953
01:44:43.611 --> 01:44:45.950
legal and this is sanctioned and we got to worry about the children.

1954
01:44:46.310 --> 01:44:49.820
It's just this adolescent stage that we're in.
We're,

1955
01:44:49.821 --> 01:44:53.330
we're learning how to process information and we're learning how to base our

1956
01:44:53.331 --> 01:44:58.331
decisions and base our ideas and our ideologies on reality as opposed to these

1957
01:44:59.720 --> 01:45:03.560
stupid ideas that we have about reefer madness or you know,
the,

1958
01:45:03.561 --> 01:45:06.350
or the ideas that they had about what,
what Booz could do to IU.
Yeah.

1959
01:45:06.351 --> 01:45:10.070
Boos can fuck you up.
It doesn't mean it should be legal.
I like it.
I like booze.

1960
01:45:10.071 --> 01:45:13.640
It should be legal.
I like that.
I could go to a bar and get a shot.
I like it.

1961
01:45:13.641 --> 01:45:16.910
I think you're ban cigarettes.
If you could do whatever the fuck you want.

1962
01:45:17.180 --> 01:45:20.600
I don't mind cigars,
cigarettes.
I think you should be able to get heroin.

1963
01:45:20.810 --> 01:45:22.430
I think he should be able to do whatever the fuck you want.

1964
01:45:22.610 --> 01:45:26.960
Kids can still get heroin.
It's not as easy,
but they can still get heroin.

1965
01:45:26.990 --> 01:45:30.530
I think that Oxycontin's are a huge fucking problem.

1966
01:45:31.050 --> 01:45:35.660
A friend of mine,
a different one who,
uh,
has a,
um,
high school kids,

1967
01:45:35.810 --> 01:45:36.643
his kid,

1968
01:45:37.560 --> 01:45:41.900
their friends got in trouble from fucking snorting oxycontin's and it's a huge

1969
01:45:41.901 --> 01:45:42.500
problem.

1970
01:45:42.500 --> 01:45:45.020
It's a huge problem with the kids' schools because they steal it from their

1971
01:45:45.021 --> 01:45:46.790
parents.
Their parents had a back injury.

1972
01:45:46.791 --> 01:45:50.300
That fucking goes on forever because pharmaceutical companies don't mind if they

1973
01:45:50.450 --> 01:45:53.840
continue to keep selling you these fucking oxycontin's.

1974
01:45:53.960 --> 01:45:56.540
He steals it from his mother cause she's whacked out of her fucking mind on

1975
01:45:56.541 --> 01:46:00.170
heroin.
Take,
take it to school,
smash it up and snort it.
And it's an issue.

1976
01:46:00.200 --> 01:46:02.840
And it's an issue with a lot of high school kids today.
You know,

1977
01:46:02.841 --> 01:46:07.490
I think we have a real problem with people wanting to do things to escape

1978
01:46:07.491 --> 01:46:07.971
reality.

1979
01:46:07.971 --> 01:46:11.000
We have a real problem and one of the real problems that we have is we don't

1980
01:46:11.001 --> 01:46:15.110
represent reality clearly to children.
We don't represent what a drug really is.

1981
01:46:15.111 --> 01:46:15.381
We don't.

1982
01:46:15.381 --> 01:46:19.310
Five minutes ago you were saying it's good for kids to experiment drugs a little

1983
01:46:19.311 --> 01:46:22.460
bit to test reality against an alternative reality.

1984
01:46:22.490 --> 01:46:27.490
We're talking about very differently about heroin is a very different subject.

1985
01:46:27.590 --> 01:46:28.970
We're talking about something that can kill you,

1986
01:46:29.060 --> 01:46:31.400
something that's physically addictive and marijuana,

1987
01:46:31.401 --> 01:46:35.010
which is fairly innocuous when you look at all the chuggers or sanction illegal,

1988
01:46:35.040 --> 01:46:39.920
but so mushrooms,
totally legal,
hundred percent legal beneficial.

1989
01:46:40.010 --> 01:46:41.570
Not only that I think will change the world.

1990
01:46:41.780 --> 01:46:44.870
We wish to be able to get heroin if we want it,
and I think it,

1991
01:46:45.020 --> 01:46:48.830
I don't think you should be able to tell me that I can't do heroin and I think

1992
01:46:48.831 --> 01:46:50.090
that's what happens when you just have

1993
01:46:50.110 --> 01:46:52.590
<v 2>laws.
That's what happens with this.
The same thing.</v>

1994
01:46:52.591 --> 01:46:55.830
I don't think you should be able to tell me what I should or shouldn't be able

1995
01:46:55.831 --> 01:46:59.310
to do if the whole world was just Dan savage and Joe Rogan.
Okay,

1996
01:46:59.311 --> 01:47:03.020
I'm on your side.
If you have heroin was legal.

1997
01:47:03.030 --> 01:47:05.730
Like Ron Paul said in one of the Republican debates.
Oh,

1998
01:47:05.731 --> 01:47:08.610
last time that I was like,
I've written that,
you know,

1999
01:47:08.611 --> 01:47:11.220
he said that her one should be legal in the republican crowd booed.

2000
01:47:11.221 --> 01:47:13.170
And he looked at them and said,
if it was legal,
would you do it?

2001
01:47:13.920 --> 01:47:17.310
That's a good question.
I live in Seattle.
The streets are paved with heroin.

2002
01:47:17.311 --> 01:47:20.880
You can get heroin and we're having a spike.
Again,
what happens in Seattle is,

2003
01:47:20.881 --> 01:47:21.370
you know,

2004
01:47:21.370 --> 01:47:23.850
whole bunch of people die and then everybody stops using heroin and then

2005
01:47:23.851 --> 01:47:27.760
everybody forgets and then everybody has to like lose some friends again.
Um,

2006
01:47:27.840 --> 01:47:30.540
there's a stupid learning curve with heroin and we're going through it again.

2007
01:47:30.990 --> 01:47:33.480
But if you know,
I'm pretty pro drugs,

2008
01:47:33.481 --> 01:47:37.710
I've used lots of different kinds of drugs and I believe in moderation in all

2009
01:47:37.711 --> 01:47:37.921
things,

2010
01:47:37.921 --> 01:47:41.700
including moderation and the best advice you can get if you find a recreational

2011
01:47:41.701 --> 01:47:44.400
drug that really works for you is to use that very rarely.

2012
01:47:44.401 --> 01:47:47.940
Cause at that impact it has the first time.
If you use it constantly,

2013
01:47:47.941 --> 01:47:50.070
you'll never have that impact ever again.
So if mushrooms,

2014
01:47:50.100 --> 01:47:53.190
if you really liked that mushroom trip,
wait a few years and then do it again,

2015
01:47:53.370 --> 01:47:57.340
do it Tuesday.
It's very different than heroin,
the comparison.

2016
01:47:57.341 --> 01:47:59.610
But the idea was that heroin,
heroin was legal.

2017
01:47:59.670 --> 01:48:03.660
I wouldn't be coming to comparison to mushrooms.
I'm not,
you just did.
I'm,
no,

2018
01:48:03.661 --> 01:48:08.160
I'm talking about moderation in all things.
No,
no,
no.
But my heroin is toxic.

2019
01:48:08.250 --> 01:48:10.530
Mushrooms or psychedelics and they're not toxic at all.

2020
01:48:10.531 --> 01:48:15.240
The LD 50 rate for mushrooms is through the,
I was just digressing off of,
uh,

2021
01:48:15.300 --> 01:48:18.120
believing that drugs should be legal in the heroin thing that we're learning now

2022
01:48:19.790 --> 01:48:22.590
with heroin.
But the thing is of heroin was legal.

2023
01:48:22.591 --> 01:48:26.460
If I could walk to a pharmacy and buy it,
I wouldn't cause I don't want to do it.

2024
01:48:26.490 --> 01:48:28.440
Good point.
But if like Ron Paul,

2025
01:48:29.570 --> 01:48:31.740
I think it would change the consciousness period.

2026
01:48:31.770 --> 01:48:35.700
I think human beings would develop a completely different sense of reality

2027
01:48:35.701 --> 01:48:39.270
itself.
Completely different south of our perspective in the universe.

2028
01:48:39.350 --> 01:48:43.470
I've used mushrooms and I didn't mind expanding.
He probably took a small dose.

2029
01:48:43.770 --> 01:48:47.010
How much do I need to take?
Five grams usually in darkness.

2030
01:48:47.040 --> 01:48:50.730
If you can get an isolation tank go that way.
Oh yeah.
Don't be a pussy.

2031
01:48:51.660 --> 01:48:54.210
If you're talking about mushrooms and you haven't gone the big route,

2032
01:48:54.360 --> 01:48:58.560
I have a finger on,
you know,
you've dipped your toes in the water.

2033
01:48:58.560 --> 01:49:01.290
You haven't jumped into the ocean.
Can I tell you what my mushrooms story,

2034
01:49:01.530 --> 01:49:04.590
it's pretty funny with some friends we went camping,

2035
01:49:04.620 --> 01:49:06.740
we were doing mushrooms and uh,

2036
01:49:06.780 --> 01:49:11.780
we're all standing in this lake in Idaho with some like redneck families camping

2037
01:49:12.061 --> 01:49:15.390
all around us and we're like two gay guys and two straight go straight couple

2038
01:49:15.600 --> 01:49:17.520
and were just tripping out of our minds,
our mushrooms.
There were standing.

2039
01:49:17.521 --> 01:49:20.820
It's like in these fish are nibbling or the hairs on her legs and we're all like

2040
01:49:20.821 --> 01:49:21.654
whoa.

2041
01:49:21.990 --> 01:49:25.650
And then suddenly there's a boat going back and forth in front of us that has

2042
01:49:25.651 --> 01:49:29.280
dare the drug resistance education logo.

2043
01:49:29.460 --> 01:49:31.980
That's like the police boat that's going back and forth in front of us.

2044
01:49:32.160 --> 01:49:35.130
And then a prop airplane comes right at us.

2045
01:49:35.131 --> 01:49:38.520
We're like standing there and this airplane is like,
we see it in the sky,

2046
01:49:38.521 --> 01:49:41.340
it's getting lower and lower.
It's pointed right at us.

2047
01:49:41.580 --> 01:49:44.370
It comes over right at us at the boat.
And we were all like,

2048
01:49:44.700 --> 01:49:48.170
we see are you seeing an airplane to each other?
And

2049
01:49:48.310 --> 01:49:51.100
<v 1>then the airplane went right over our heads and we all shit ourselves.</v>

2050
01:49:51.101 --> 01:49:53.080
We were terrified.
We look,

2051
01:49:53.081 --> 01:49:57.550
how would the fucking disappeared like right behind us on this little rise.

2052
01:49:57.580 --> 01:49:58.720
And we're like,
what the fuck?

2053
01:49:59.140 --> 01:50:01.780
And we ran up there thinking it was going to be a plane crash and there is a

2054
01:50:01.781 --> 01:50:03.810
runway.
See,

2055
01:50:03.910 --> 01:50:08.020
cause we come down to the beach sideways and along the sand and there was an

2056
01:50:08.021 --> 01:50:11.620
airport right there.
But there was this moment where like we're tripping,

2057
01:50:11.621 --> 01:50:13.810
the fish are eating us,
the dare boats going like this,

2058
01:50:13.811 --> 01:50:17.760
which is making us paranoid and now here comes the plane for our heads and have

2059
01:50:17.761 --> 01:50:19.690
it done.
Mushroom said so maybe that's why.
Yeah,

2060
01:50:19.691 --> 01:50:23.110
that's probably a bad place to do mushrooms set and setting is one of the most

2061
01:50:23.111 --> 01:50:24.430
important thing that has any sort of,

2062
01:50:25.040 --> 01:50:30.040
well where you were on a boat with a fucking dare boat going by in a plane

2063
01:50:30.131 --> 01:50:31.510
flying and you rent a runway.

2064
01:50:31.870 --> 01:50:33.730
We had no idea we were standing at the foot of a runner.

2065
01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:36.680
Silence is usually the best option,
you know,

2066
01:50:36.700 --> 01:50:40.990
silence and darkness is with Terence Mckenna prescribed silent darkness is the

2067
01:50:40.991 --> 01:50:44.470
best way to do any sort of psychedelic because then you were alone with the

2068
01:50:44.471 --> 01:50:48.850
psychedelic and not any sort of external factors that you would have to take

2069
01:50:48.851 --> 01:50:53.800
into consideration when you experienced the trip.
But I'll file that away.
Yeah,

2070
01:50:53.801 --> 01:50:56.560
I mean do what you want,
but I think if you want to do mushrooms,

2071
01:50:56.561 --> 01:50:59.650
it should be God damn legal.
And I think if it was legal,
we changed the world.

2072
01:50:59.651 --> 01:51:04.651
I think we had sanctioned centers where people could go and have what we

2073
01:51:05.230 --> 01:51:06.850
consider a modern day Sharman.

2074
01:51:06.851 --> 01:51:11.140
Someone who understood the reactions to these drugs had pure drugs.

2075
01:51:11.610 --> 01:51:12.443
And again,

2076
01:51:12.460 --> 01:51:16.180
the problem is the word drug cause drugs is giant blanket that we throw over

2077
01:51:16.181 --> 01:51:20.050
aspirin and caffeine and alcohol and psychedelics.

2078
01:51:20.080 --> 01:51:24.460
I mean it's preposterous that all these things with radically different results,

2079
01:51:24.670 --> 01:51:28.120
radically different effects on the human body are all under the same blanket.

2080
01:51:28.330 --> 01:51:29.163
I mean it's crazy.

2081
01:51:29.260 --> 01:51:34.210
I mean command than if all food in me just food was just a blank term for food

2082
01:51:34.480 --> 01:51:39.370
and all food had incredible meet.
Some of them were anabolic and they made,

2083
01:51:39.380 --> 01:51:43.390
made you grow giant muscles and other ones were toxic and they fucked you up.

2084
01:51:43.400 --> 01:51:45.550
And if food was so,

2085
01:51:46.320 --> 01:51:50.050
it was differentiated by that and one blanket term,
it would be really weird,

2086
01:51:50.320 --> 01:51:51.011
you know?
But no,

2087
01:51:51.011 --> 01:51:54.830
we have vegetables and we have meets and we have fish and we have what?
GTE?

2088
01:51:54.850 --> 01:51:59.650
I had fruit,
I had food.
You don't say I had food.
Which do?
It took drugs.

2089
01:51:59.651 --> 01:52:03.670
What kind of drugs did you take?
I took heroin.
Oh,
took aspirin.
I took aspirin.

2090
01:52:03.671 --> 01:52:06.100
What does it,
is that a drug,
you know?
You know what I mean?

2091
01:52:06.101 --> 01:52:09.430
It's like I took caffeine.
Oh,
that's not a drug.
You just drank coffee,

2092
01:52:09.580 --> 01:52:13.450
but it says drug.
Oh,
I had a cigarette.
That's not a drug.
Yes it is.
Yeah.

2093
01:52:13.451 --> 01:52:16.210
You to drug distribution device.
It's you burn,

2094
01:52:16.211 --> 01:52:19.990
it gets in your bloodstream very quickly that way.
Yeah.
It's a drug like what?

2095
01:52:20.050 --> 01:52:23.710
That's a drug to,
yes,
that's a drug.
I don't do drugs but I like to drink.

2096
01:52:23.740 --> 01:52:26.530
You're fucking doing drugs.
God dammit.

2097
01:52:27.220 --> 01:52:29.320
We have a real problem with our definitions.

2098
01:52:29.321 --> 01:52:33.160
We have a real problem with that one blanket term and that's why we have this

2099
01:52:33.161 --> 01:52:35.620
war against drugs.
It's fucking ridiculous.
No,

2100
01:52:36.210 --> 01:52:38.560
it's fucking not ending is it is a restart up.

2101
01:52:38.570 --> 01:52:41.650
If some other fucking dumped on gets an office like Chris Christie,

2102
01:52:41.651 --> 01:52:46.651
that dummy who think marijuana should be legal on my watch cheeseburgers,

2103
01:52:47.350 --> 01:52:50.240
sucking asshole once to keep marijuana out of his state.

2104
01:52:50.270 --> 01:52:53.420
There's facts on the ground and there's a exit campy unscrambled and I think

2105
01:52:53.421 --> 01:52:57.770
what's happening in Washington state and Colorado around patch was undone cash

2106
01:52:57.771 --> 01:53:00.530
wise.
Yeah.
I think that's what it is.
I think it's the generation of income,

2107
01:53:00.540 --> 01:53:03.740
but I think that's what's changing the whole game because money influences

2108
01:53:03.741 --> 01:53:05.030
politics more than anything.

2109
01:53:05.031 --> 01:53:08.300
And corporations have been able to get the sort of the,

2110
01:53:08.301 --> 01:53:12.110
the hold on that they've had a monopoly on influence through money.

2111
01:53:12.320 --> 01:53:16.070
But I think that now what you're seeing with Colorado first year,
first of all,

2112
01:53:16.100 --> 01:53:20.870
39% is what their tax marijuana on and Colorado recreationally,

2113
01:53:20.990 --> 01:53:25.430
medically,
it's far lower,
but 39% recreationally.
And people are like,
okay,

2114
01:53:25.670 --> 01:53:28.160
39 is fine.
No one's complaining it off.
So because of that,

2115
01:53:28.161 --> 01:53:31.130
you're getting hundreds of millions of dollars of potential revenue.

2116
01:53:31.250 --> 01:53:33.170
The first year is going to be over a hundred million dollars.

2117
01:53:33.200 --> 01:53:35.870
That's a lot of fucking money.
And when that kind of money happens,

2118
01:53:35.871 --> 01:53:37.730
then Republicans start thinking about owning it,

2119
01:53:37.940 --> 01:53:42.260
owning warehouses filled with marijuana,
grow hops.
And when that happens,
yeah,

2120
01:53:42.460 --> 01:53:47.120
and,
and hopefully they'll smoke a little and fucking relax and feel a little

2121
01:53:47.121 --> 01:53:48.650
paranoid.
That's a good part.

2122
01:53:48.830 --> 01:53:52.070
Feeling Humble Republicans do not have a problem with feeling paranoid.
Well,

2123
01:53:52.071 --> 01:53:56.360
they should feel paranoid about their actions and their thoughts and the lack of

2124
01:53:56.361 --> 01:53:59.480
compassion that they showed of various aspects of our society.

2125
01:53:59.870 --> 01:54:01.550
I think that's one of the things that marijuana does,

2126
01:54:01.551 --> 01:54:05.150
the vulnerability that people like to call it,
paranoia,
in my opinion,
it's a,

2127
01:54:05.151 --> 01:54:08.510
it's a heightening of awareness and it's taking off your blinders and making you

2128
01:54:08.511 --> 01:54:11.750
recognize it.
You should be a little paranoid.
You should be a little,

2129
01:54:11.930 --> 01:54:14.330
a little more humble.
Nobody likes cocky people.

2130
01:54:14.331 --> 01:54:17.660
Nobody likes people that aren't afraid of anything fucking fearless and think

2131
01:54:17.661 --> 01:54:20.930
that they're the shit that's like one of the worst aspects of,
of human beings.

2132
01:54:20.931 --> 01:54:24.080
Right?
Well,
that's one of the one things that marijuana chips away at.

2133
01:54:24.380 --> 01:54:27.830
It slammed that thing right down into the gutter and makes you realize,
look,

2134
01:54:27.860 --> 01:54:30.200
you fucking not here for very long,
man.

2135
01:54:30.201 --> 01:54:34.010
You're not here for very long and consider the whole picture considered the big

2136
01:54:34.011 --> 01:54:35.810
thing.
That's what psychedelics do.

2137
01:54:35.811 --> 01:54:39.920
They allow you to consider things in a way other than this pattern is groove

2138
01:54:39.921 --> 01:54:43.640
that you've sort of cut in by driving the same way to work every day and dealing

2139
01:54:43.641 --> 01:54:46.970
with the same church and dealing with the same people in your office and the

2140
01:54:46.971 --> 01:54:49.540
same fucking NRA newsletters you get everyday.

2141
01:54:49.640 --> 01:54:54.260
You're carving a path of of cognitive dissonance and you don't realize it until

2142
01:54:54.261 --> 01:54:56.300
you do something that makes you get out of that path.

2143
01:54:56.330 --> 01:54:59.290
How do we get some mushrooms to Sarah Palin?
Yeah,
you go,

2144
01:54:59.600 --> 01:55:04.130
Sarah Pailin needs a lot.
She needs a lot,
but she can in isolation.
She also,

2145
01:55:04.160 --> 01:55:07.670
we need an isolation tank for her.
We all,
everyone needs an isolation tech.

2146
01:55:07.700 --> 01:55:09.290
I think literally everyone needs one.

2147
01:55:09.291 --> 01:55:11.780
I think it's one of the most positive things you could ever have in your life.

2148
01:55:11.900 --> 01:55:16.040
The the chance to be alone with your thoughts.
It's a very rare thing.

2149
01:55:16.041 --> 01:55:18.920
Even when you meditate,
you feel the ground underneath your butt.

2150
01:55:19.190 --> 01:55:21.590
You feel your hands sitting on your knees.
You know,

2151
01:55:21.591 --> 01:55:25.490
you feel your fingertips touching each other.
You feel,
you hear things,
you're,

2152
01:55:25.491 --> 01:55:27.960
you're in a room.
You can open your eyes,
you see the room.
You know,

2153
01:55:28.200 --> 01:55:31.820
even even that it's,
it's good to meditate.
It's great.

2154
01:55:31.940 --> 01:55:36.020
It's way better to meditate in an isolation tank.
A woman just float,
right?
Yes.

2155
01:55:36.040 --> 01:55:36.471
Yeah,
yeah.

2156
01:55:36.471 --> 01:55:40.820
Sensory deprivation tanks were invented by a guy named John Lilly who was a

2157
01:55:40.880 --> 01:55:41.451
pioneer,

2158
01:55:41.451 --> 01:55:46.451
an interspecies communication is he used to take acid and is it set up a dolphin

2159
01:55:46.770 --> 01:55:50.700
tank next to his isolation tank and you try to communicate with the dolphins.

2160
01:55:50.700 --> 01:55:54.090
They're doing acid in a sensory deprivation tank.
And it was a fascinating,

2161
01:55:54.091 --> 01:55:54.924
fascinating guy,

2162
01:55:55.200 --> 01:55:59.550
but he was trying to figure out a way to remove the influence of the external

2163
01:55:59.551 --> 01:56:03.480
reactions that the body has to stimuli,
to touching things and hearing things.

2164
01:56:03.481 --> 01:56:07.410
And he was the first one that he invented.
He had a,
uh,
like a mask,

2165
01:56:07.411 --> 01:56:12.390
a good giant like scuba diver,
old school,
Jules Verne type bubble head.

2166
01:56:12.690 --> 01:56:16.620
And it was strapped with all these harnesses and he would just float with this

2167
01:56:16.621 --> 01:56:18.390
air bubble that attached to his head.

2168
01:56:18.391 --> 01:56:20.730
And that was his first tank with warm water.

2169
01:56:20.880 --> 01:56:23.430
The water has to be essentially the same temperature as the surface of your skin

2170
01:56:23.431 --> 01:56:24.570
so you don't feel the water anymore,

2171
01:56:24.780 --> 01:56:26.730
but you still feel the straps and the helmet.

2172
01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:30.840
And he kind of ignored that and we'd go into this state and then he figured out

2173
01:56:30.841 --> 01:56:33.870
that you could just put really,
really salty water.

2174
01:56:33.900 --> 01:56:37.860
So the tank has 800 to a thousand pounds of salt in an Epsom salts,

2175
01:56:37.861 --> 01:56:41.220
which is actually a very good way of absorbing magnesium because it's absorbed

2176
01:56:41.221 --> 01:56:43.530
through the skin and you lie down on this tank,

2177
01:56:44.220 --> 01:56:46.140
the temperature's the same temperature as the surface of your skin.

2178
01:56:46.380 --> 01:56:49.740
Close the door at total silence,
total darkness,
half your body's underwater.

2179
01:56:49.950 --> 01:56:51.900
And in the absence of sensory input,

2180
01:56:52.020 --> 01:56:57.020
any sensory input your brain has resources that are beyond what you ever achieve

2181
01:56:57.751 --> 01:57:00.180
in everyday life.
Because if we're having this conversation,

2182
01:57:00.181 --> 01:57:03.000
there's a jackhammer going off next door.
It would be very distracting.

2183
01:57:03.001 --> 01:57:04.030
We would want to go in the other room,

2184
01:57:04.031 --> 01:57:06.660
but we didn't hear the Jackhammer and that would be a relief.
Well,

2185
01:57:06.670 --> 01:57:10.620
life is a fucking jackhammer.
Everything you do is,
is,
is input.

2186
01:57:10.650 --> 01:57:13.500
It's all changed the water.
I wouldn't want to use the water if somebody else,

2187
01:57:13.940 --> 01:57:17.730
well it depends.
Yeah,
that's,
that's one thing.
Um,
it depends on where you go.

2188
01:57:17.731 --> 01:57:19.350
They always change the water.
First of all,

2189
01:57:19.351 --> 01:57:22.590
they changed the water and there's massive filtration systems that are involved.

2190
01:57:22.591 --> 01:57:22.851
Like the,

2191
01:57:22.851 --> 01:57:26.580
the place that I go to a that I got my tank from is a place called the float lab

2192
01:57:26.940 --> 01:57:29.850
and this guy crash will be on the podcast.
We're working on getting them on here.

2193
01:57:30.150 --> 01:57:33.060
He has developed this intense,
uh,

2194
01:57:33.630 --> 01:57:37.230
filtration system that also involves ozone ozone,

2195
01:57:37.231 --> 01:57:40.860
which kills anything that might be alive inside of the water.

2196
01:57:40.861 --> 01:57:45.000
The water itself being so hyper salinated that kills everything as well.

2197
01:57:45.001 --> 01:57:47.310
And it goes through two massive filters,

2198
01:57:47.610 --> 01:57:51.510
which are intensely small amount of particles or you know,

2199
01:57:51.850 --> 01:57:55.710
they're all filtered out of this system.
And then you change the water,
you know,

2200
01:57:55.740 --> 01:57:58.350
regularly as well.
If it's a commercial thing,

2201
01:57:58.351 --> 01:58:01.380
mine my keep my water in there for six,
seven months at a time,

2202
01:58:01.381 --> 01:58:06.330
maybe a year at a time.
That's fine.
But that's the least of your problems.

2203
01:58:06.480 --> 01:58:08.760
You know,
there's very few things are going to survive in that water.

2204
01:58:08.790 --> 01:58:13.290
I mean you could have some Weirdo appeasing and I guess take a shower
afterwards,

2205
01:58:13.291 --> 01:58:15.210
don't worry.
But the,
the,

2206
01:58:15.211 --> 01:58:20.010
the benefits of an isolation being totally do it.
They have place in Seattle.

2207
01:58:20.820 --> 01:58:22.260
The guys in Seattle messages me all the time.

2208
01:58:22.261 --> 01:58:25.110
They started it after they heard about it on the podcast.
Hello?
Yeah,

2209
01:58:25.111 --> 01:58:29.370
they started a tank center.
Um,
I know there's at least two in Seattle.

2210
01:58:29.371 --> 01:58:31.350
There's one that just opened up an Austin.

2211
01:58:31.351 --> 01:58:34.080
This guy is a bad motherfucker was creating them out of a,

2212
01:58:34.110 --> 01:58:36.270
he's using like a boat halls,

2213
01:58:36.480 --> 01:58:40.110
like the same companies that manufactured bolt holes and he's having them build

2214
01:58:40.111 --> 01:58:44.080
these tanks to his specifications so that there's no lining.

2215
01:58:44.320 --> 01:58:46.690
You don't have to have a liner at the bottom of them because some of the old

2216
01:58:46.691 --> 01:58:50.530
ones that these to make kind of flimsy and the liner was like a water bed liner

2217
01:58:50.531 --> 01:58:53.080
and sometimes it would break and it would leak and it would be a huge pain in

2218
01:58:53.081 --> 01:58:55.960
the ass.
You have to drain it and then put another new liner in.

2219
01:58:56.200 --> 01:58:58.870
Sometimes the heaters or burnout and it would cook through the liner.

2220
01:58:59.200 --> 01:59:03.070
But crash uses this liner that's like,
I'm a Koi pond liner.

2221
01:59:03.071 --> 01:59:06.580
This is really thick rubber and it's not,
nothing's going to break that thing.

2222
01:59:06.581 --> 01:59:07.060
It's,
it's,

2223
01:59:07.060 --> 01:59:12.060
it's excellent and I think it's a huge resource and if no one's had one,

2224
01:59:13.210 --> 01:59:15.430
you're really doing yourself a disservice.

2225
01:59:15.431 --> 01:59:19.360
It's an amazing thing and it's a chance to have a psychedelic experience with no

2226
01:59:19.361 --> 01:59:22.980
drugs.
Your mind in the absence of any sensory input becomes very sexy,

2227
01:59:23.100 --> 01:59:23.780
<v 3>delicate.
You,</v>

2228
01:59:23.780 --> 01:59:26.990
you would recommend also doing mushrooms and getting in the tank if you really

2229
01:59:26.991 --> 01:59:29.530
ready to go deep.
That's the way to do it.

2230
01:59:29.750 --> 01:59:32.120
<v 1>Lily.
Lily used to do it with ketamine.</v>

2231
01:59:32.360 --> 01:59:35.630
He sees you in intramuscular shots of ketamine and going to that,

2232
01:59:35.810 --> 01:59:39.620
which I don't recommend is ketamine has some pretty severe addictive properties

2233
01:59:39.621 --> 01:59:40.450
to it.
And Yeah,

2234
01:59:40.450 --> 01:59:44.210
<v 3>horse tranquilizer,
cat it.
Cat Tranquilizer.
Yeah.</v>

2235
01:59:45.080 --> 01:59:47.720
No,
I think it's cat.
Um,

2236
01:59:47.810 --> 01:59:52.130
whatever the fuck a tranquilizer that we use on animals,
veterinary tranquilizer,

2237
01:59:52.340 --> 01:59:55.790
but uh,
has some intense psychedelic properties to it.
Apparently.

2238
01:59:56.120 --> 01:59:57.830
I'm going to have to go.
You gotta go.

2239
01:59:58.050 --> 02:00:00.560
I gotta get to the end of the earth by three o'clock.
Shit,

2240
02:00:00.700 --> 02:00:05.240
we had so much other things to talk about.
Do you want to rattle off by them?
No,

2241
02:00:05.241 --> 02:00:05.630
no,

2242
02:00:05.630 --> 02:00:07.940
<v 1>we don't have to.
Uh,
look,
I just think,
um,</v>

2243
02:00:08.120 --> 02:00:11.450
I wanted to talk about the transgender thing to find out why people were angry

2244
02:00:11.451 --> 02:00:13.340
at you.
What,
where transgender people angry.

2245
02:00:13.430 --> 02:00:15.540
<v 3>Uh,
there's,
um,</v>

2246
02:00:15.800 --> 02:00:20.800
a segment of the Trans community that believes that you shouldn't be allowed to

2247
02:00:21.051 --> 02:00:24.450
use the word tranny.
That trainee is a hate term.
Um,

2248
02:00:24.650 --> 02:00:28.220
I have in my column savage love,
and on my podcast I have a podcast,

2249
02:00:28.221 --> 02:00:32.780
the savage Lovecast,
uh,
but in the column when I started in [inaudible] 91,

2250
02:00:33.200 --> 02:00:36.530
um,
as part of Queer nation,
and there was this movement to reclaim hate words.

2251
02:00:36.531 --> 02:00:39.590
And so I used Queer Faggot,
dyke,
sissy,
tranny,
and breeder,

2252
02:00:39.591 --> 02:00:43.100
which is our Hayward for straight people.
Um,
you can use that by the way.

2253
02:00:43.760 --> 02:00:46.910
We don't mind [inaudible] have a problem with that.

2254
02:00:46.911 --> 02:00:50.600
Let's have a hate term and more of an acknowledgement of your utility because we

2255
02:00:50.601 --> 02:00:55.430
do reproduce ourselves out of your bodies for the most part.
Um,
and you know,

2256
02:00:55.431 --> 02:00:56.390
about four years ago,

2257
02:00:56.391 --> 02:00:59.900
kind of a top secret memo went out that trainee was no longer worried that

2258
02:00:59.901 --> 02:01:03.140
people could use and top secret.
Well in a way like tranny,

2259
02:01:03.141 --> 02:01:06.650
which had always sort of been okay to use became not okay,
it became the t word.

2260
02:01:06.651 --> 02:01:08.720
Now it's the t slur.
Uh,

2261
02:01:08.780 --> 02:01:13.780
and that's a little like weird and dishonest about it is all usages of it prior

2262
02:01:14.601 --> 02:01:18.920
to the movement to get people to stop using it are considered hate speech.

2263
02:01:19.400 --> 02:01:20.780
Um,
I've stopped using it.

2264
02:01:20.781 --> 02:01:24.410
I only use it when I'm asked about why this word is problematic or why I don't

2265
02:01:24.411 --> 02:01:28.310
use it anymore.
Um,
but there's certain chunk of the Trans Community that can't,

2266
02:01:28.370 --> 02:01:29.203
uh,

2267
02:01:29.360 --> 02:01:34.130
can't accept a change and wants to continue to scream and yell about prior

2268
02:01:34.131 --> 02:01:38.300
usages that they objected to when I don't use it anymore.
Yeah.

2269
02:01:38.750 --> 02:01:43.580
People super sensitive about words.
I think intent is the most important thing.

2270
02:01:44.690 --> 02:01:47.410
Faggot.
Uh,
when I started savage love,

2271
02:01:47.420 --> 02:01:50.030
I'm gay and it's an advice column for straight people,

2272
02:01:50.150 --> 02:01:54.560
mostly about straight sex and the salutation.
Like,
dear Abby,
dear Abby,

2273
02:01:54.561 --> 02:01:57.270
every letter B in another column with dear Abby.
Um,

2274
02:01:57.500 --> 02:01:59.480
every letter in my column again with Hey Faggot,

2275
02:01:59.940 --> 02:02:01.610
that's what you wanted to call savage love.

2276
02:02:02.070 --> 02:02:03.410
It's what I wanted to call it to begin with.

2277
02:02:03.680 --> 02:02:08.240
And that really proved that intent made a word hateful,

2278
02:02:08.241 --> 02:02:11.090
not the string of letters,
because some people would write a faggot.

2279
02:02:11.091 --> 02:02:14.780
I love your column,
I love your advice.
Please help me.
I think you're awesome.

2280
02:02:14.960 --> 02:02:16.460
And then the next letter would be,
hey,
faggot,

2281
02:02:16.461 --> 02:02:18.380
you're a cock sucking sodomite piece of shit.

2282
02:02:18.381 --> 02:02:22.720
You should go to hell and burn and die.
Obviously in the first letter faggot,

2283
02:02:22.750 --> 02:02:25.130
it was a compliment.
This person was using faggot affectionately.

2284
02:02:25.131 --> 02:02:28.040
This person was eating faggot.
The way I use faggot with my husband.

2285
02:02:28.630 --> 02:02:30.260
And the second letter,
this is somebody using it.

2286
02:02:30.261 --> 02:02:33.290
Hatefully and that just proved that intent made a word hateful,

2287
02:02:33.291 --> 02:02:37.210
not the word.
And so now,
you know,

2288
02:02:37.211 --> 02:02:39.990
I still use faggot in the column.
I'm not one of those,
uh,

2289
02:02:40.010 --> 02:02:44.640
gay rights activists who when David Spade or Jonah Hill or Alec Baldwin uses

2290
02:02:44.660 --> 02:02:47.270
Faggot like falls down and screams and yells and calls for their heads.

2291
02:02:47.670 --> 02:02:49.640
I've actually defended David spade,

2292
02:02:49.641 --> 02:02:51.860
well a million years ago from glad when they were after him.

2293
02:02:52.190 --> 02:02:54.710
I think Louis C K does it a hilarious things with faggot.

2294
02:02:55.070 --> 02:02:59.150
So I don't think that it's not a hate word anymore if you can't let straight

2295
02:02:59.151 --> 02:03:03.350
people use it when the Kate,
when their intent is clearly not hateful.

2296
02:03:03.620 --> 02:03:08.620
And so I feel like it shouldn't be a problem for people to use the t word tranny

2297
02:03:09.140 --> 02:03:10.340
in a non hateful context.

2298
02:03:10.341 --> 02:03:14.690
But so many trans people are so invested right now politically in stopping its

2299
02:03:14.691 --> 02:03:18.830
usage at all ever.
And uh,
you know,

2300
02:03:18.831 --> 02:03:20.780
in deference to their delicate sensibilities,

2301
02:03:20.781 --> 02:03:25.730
I've stopped the delicate sensibilities things.
Totally understandable.
I mean,

2302
02:03:25.731 --> 02:03:29.500
I couldn't imagine what it would be like growing up in one gender,

2303
02:03:29.510 --> 02:03:34.310
wanting to be another gender and experiencing just a massive amount of hate and

2304
02:03:34.311 --> 02:03:38.270
rejection your whole life.
Because of that trans people face is off the charts,

2305
02:03:38.490 --> 02:03:41.900
the discrimination,
the suicide rate,
the employment conditions,

2306
02:03:41.930 --> 02:03:45.380
the violence and the numbers of people who are trans who are murdered every year

2307
02:03:45.710 --> 02:03:49.730
is outrageous.
You know,
when we talk about anti gay bullying,

2308
02:03:50.060 --> 02:03:53.240
it's usually tied to gender nonconformity.
Uh,

2309
02:03:53.350 --> 02:03:57.020
it's like girls who are masculine and boys who are sissies and a lot of those

2310
02:03:57.021 --> 02:03:59.330
kids who are gender nonconforming or also trans kids.

2311
02:03:59.331 --> 02:04:02.890
So a lot of that anti queer bullying of Queer youth is anti-trans bullying.

2312
02:04:03.120 --> 02:04:07.730
It is really the movement of the moment when it comes to sexual rights and

2313
02:04:08.810 --> 02:04:13.610
sexual minorities and gender rights,
gender expression,
minorities.
Um,
and it's,

2314
02:04:14.060 --> 02:04:17.850
they have legitimate things I think to be extremely angry about.

2315
02:04:17.860 --> 02:04:20.330
But I think some of that anger gets diverted into word policing.

2316
02:04:20.331 --> 02:04:23.600
That's not helpful.
Like Bill O'reilly was just on TV last week,

2317
02:04:23.900 --> 02:04:28.130
telling the parents of trans kids to do what all the research shows,

2318
02:04:28.370 --> 02:04:32.840
drives those kids to suicide.
What does that,
what was he saying?
Reject them.

2319
02:04:33.110 --> 02:04:37.070
What to reject them to refuse to acknowledge their identities too.

2320
02:04:37.110 --> 02:04:39.480
He was not telling people this is,

2321
02:04:39.630 --> 02:04:44.250
he was objecting to this video with these parents who had allowed their kid to

2322
02:04:44.251 --> 02:04:46.710
transition and he was saying,
you should never do that.

2323
02:04:46.711 --> 02:04:49.630
And was really just giving the,
if you want your,

2324
02:04:49.710 --> 02:04:51.660
if you want to drive your trans kid to suicide,

2325
02:04:51.661 --> 02:04:53.490
do what bill O'Reilly is telling you to do.

2326
02:04:53.850 --> 02:04:58.850
And there wasn't as much screaming and yelling about that as there was about Ru

2327
02:04:59.070 --> 02:05:02.220
Paul using female or shemale on Rupaul's drag race.

2328
02:05:02.520 --> 02:05:05.940
And that seems a little like disproportionate to me,
the butt.
But you can,

2329
02:05:06.360 --> 02:05:10.740
but you know,
ru Paul will listen and logo,
we'll listen and maybe change.

2330
02:05:10.860 --> 02:05:13.680
And I think the sense is that there's nothing they could say to a Riley that's

2331
02:05:13.681 --> 02:05:16.650
going to stop him from hating and trolling,
uh,

2332
02:05:16.680 --> 02:05:18.980
trans people or the parents of trans kids trolling.

2333
02:05:19.010 --> 02:05:20.460
So there's no word for what he does as well.

2334
02:05:20.610 --> 02:05:22.350
So there's no benefit in going after a Riley,

2335
02:05:22.351 --> 02:05:24.480
whereas he could go after logo and they will change.

2336
02:05:24.780 --> 02:05:26.820
But when you want to raise the awareness,

2337
02:05:26.821 --> 02:05:31.821
when you want to save kids who are trans from the kind of parental bullying and

2338
02:05:31.831 --> 02:05:36.030
rejection that leads to suicide,
I think you do need to go after her Riley.
Yeah.

2339
02:05:36.031 --> 02:05:37.140
What is,
what was he saying?

2340
02:05:37.141 --> 02:05:39.630
He's saying that they should ignore kids that are saying that they're

2341
02:05:39.631 --> 02:05:41.380
transgender.
They should tell their kid.

2342
02:05:41.400 --> 02:05:45.090
They should insist that this little kid who was grow out of it,

2343
02:05:45.120 --> 02:05:49.060
who is identified as female at birth,
which is how you have to say it now,
um,

2344
02:05:49.230 --> 02:05:52.690
was not actually a male and they should,
you know,

2345
02:05:53.940 --> 02:05:58.230
refuse to let the kid transition or live as the gender that the kid knows itself

2346
02:05:58.231 --> 02:06:02.960
to be refuse.
Yeah.
Like,
how do you refuse to,
well you did,

2347
02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:06.150
this happens all the time to turn those kids where there's a kid who,
you know,

2348
02:06:06.160 --> 02:06:10.120
uh,
was born a girl,
which,
you know,
you,
some people,

2349
02:06:10.200 --> 02:06:11.730
some trans people would say that even that,

2350
02:06:12.330 --> 02:06:16.200
a formula that I use now to talk about that kid is itself Trans phobic.

2351
02:06:16.350 --> 02:06:20.100
There's a kid who's born a girl who,
who,
who is male.
The,

2352
02:06:20.430 --> 02:06:21.630
the brain has a gender.

2353
02:06:21.631 --> 02:06:24.180
It's gendered and wants to bring the body into alignment with the brain.

2354
02:06:24.590 --> 02:06:28.530
And there are parents who will bully that kid who will refuse to let that kid

2355
02:06:28.531 --> 02:06:29.580
express their gender,

2356
02:06:30.540 --> 02:06:34.460
their real gender as opposed to the gender they appeared to be at birth,
uh,

2357
02:06:34.500 --> 02:06:37.800
because of their genitalia.
Um,
who will,
you know,

2358
02:06:38.880 --> 02:06:42.540
not allow the kid to cut her hair,

2359
02:06:42.541 --> 02:06:45.930
cut his hair into a masculine haircut,
one,

2360
02:06:45.931 --> 02:06:50.090
allow that kid to wear boy clothes when allowed that kid to use,
uh,
the,

2361
02:06:50.110 --> 02:06:52.990
the male Pronoun to be He,
uh,

2362
02:06:53.070 --> 02:06:56.970
and that sort of rejection and creates the dysphoria,

2363
02:06:56.971 --> 02:07:00.480
creates the inner conflict that for a lot of trans gets,
destroys them.
And so,

2364
02:07:00.520 --> 02:07:05.160
oh Riley was saying to these people do that that you should just force them.

2365
02:07:05.200 --> 02:07:10.080
Yeah.
Wow.
Well it goes back to the whole pink hair thing.
It does.

2366
02:07:10.081 --> 02:07:14.160
It does bring people to do anything outside of like some of those who are in the

2367
02:07:14.161 --> 02:07:16.740
LGBT movement as I am.
Um,

2368
02:07:16.830 --> 02:07:21.830
but who are not ourselves trans look at the like focus on language and pronouns

2369
02:07:23.221 --> 02:07:28.221
and who said what when and who stopped and who didn't and think this is a lot of

2370
02:07:29.281 --> 02:07:30.690
effort being expended,

2371
02:07:30.990 --> 02:07:34.920
lecturing your allies and going after people who are on your side.
Meanwhile,

2372
02:07:34.960 --> 02:07:35.793
you know,

2373
02:07:35.980 --> 02:07:39.610
O'Reilly's pumping this through Fox News into homes all across the country and

2374
02:07:39.611 --> 02:07:43.420
to conservative homes in red states and places where there may actually be trans

2375
02:07:43.421 --> 02:07:45.940
kids who are very vulnerable to that kind of parental rejection.

2376
02:07:46.300 --> 02:07:48.460
That might be something we want to focus on.

2377
02:07:48.770 --> 02:07:52.040
<v 1>You see how they would think,
well if we could get you to stop doing it,</v>

2378
02:07:52.070 --> 02:07:53.810
that would be a step in the right direction.

2379
02:07:53.870 --> 02:07:56.450
And then from there we could just stop.
I have stopped.

2380
02:07:56.690 --> 02:08:01.690
The word tranny though to me is like he realized here is Hab driver and you're a

2381
02:08:01.761 --> 02:08:06.290
Cabbie.
You know,
that's a problem.
Is it negative training?

2382
02:08:06.291 --> 02:08:06.980
Is it negative?

2383
02:08:06.980 --> 02:08:11.750
<v 3>That is,
that is a lot of people's argument.
That trainee is this affectionate,</v>

2384
02:08:11.751 --> 02:08:16.220
diminutive for transgender also for a transvestite,
right.

2385
02:08:16.221 --> 02:08:20.090
And a lot of transgenders for people objected very vociferously to being lumped

2386
02:08:20.091 --> 02:08:23.900
in with transvestites are not the same thing.
Um,
but you know,

2387
02:08:23.930 --> 02:08:25.130
a lot of people who do drag,

2388
02:08:25.160 --> 02:08:28.670
particularly old school drag queens like RuPaul been around for a long time who

2389
02:08:28.700 --> 02:08:33.700
self identified as trainees and our sort of have a moment of a time of an era

2390
02:08:33.921 --> 02:08:38.921
when a transgender people and drag queens and a lot of people who were drag

2391
02:08:39.591 --> 02:08:41.390
kings and scenesters,

2392
02:08:41.391 --> 02:08:44.660
we're really part of the same clicks and subcultures.

2393
02:08:45.020 --> 02:08:50.000
And so that the use of the word tranny wasn't,
uh,
what's this umbrella term that,

2394
02:08:50.200 --> 02:08:50.990
that,
that,

2395
02:08:50.990 --> 02:08:55.580
that spoke of unity between transgender people and other people who are gender

2396
02:08:55.581 --> 02:09:00.410
nonconforming like a ru Paul,
like a drag queen or Justin Bond.

2397
02:09:00.710 --> 02:09:02.990
And so they don't understand this sudden desire,

2398
02:09:03.210 --> 02:09:07.070
particularly on the part of a lot of young trans activists to declare this word

2399
02:09:07.100 --> 02:09:07.760
that you know,

2400
02:09:07.760 --> 02:09:12.760
for Ru Paul's generation meant unity between who he was or who she is and who

2401
02:09:13.850 --> 02:09:18.050
his trans brothers and sisters were like.
That was the word that unified them.

2402
02:09:18.290 --> 02:09:20.320
And they're saying that this is a word that stigmatized,

2403
02:09:20.480 --> 02:09:25.070
and this is a word that cannot be used anymore.
And I think,
uh,
the Ru Paul,
uh,

2404
02:09:25.100 --> 02:09:28.880
you know,
Rupaul doesn't,
uh,
that doesn't understand.
He rejects it.

2405
02:09:28.910 --> 02:09:33.410
He thinks it's misplaced.
And uh,
he still uses the word.

2406
02:09:33.560 --> 02:09:37.310
I don't,
well,
except when I talk about it,
I will get grief for this conversation.

2407
02:09:37.460 --> 02:09:40.910
You need to use the word to talk about not using the word is a problem.

2408
02:09:40.990 --> 02:09:43.360
<v 1>So you should say the t word sort of like saying the n word.</v>

2409
02:09:43.390 --> 02:09:46.780
Like if a white person starts saying nigger in a conversation instead of the n

2410
02:09:46.781 --> 02:09:50.890
word,
it becomes an issue.
I said,
he said,
at least I love Louis Ck is,

2411
02:09:50.891 --> 02:09:55.720
but that the n word is just what white people say to get away with saying yes

2412
02:09:56.140 --> 02:09:58.510
and make you're making someone think of you're making it someone say it to

2413
02:09:58.511 --> 02:10:01.900
themselves,
do you say n word?
And they have to say nigger in their own heads.

2414
02:10:01.930 --> 02:10:05.980
I got in trouble with the Trans community because there was a woman who used to

2415
02:10:05.981 --> 02:10:10.981
be a man who was a man for 30 years and then decided to start MMA fighting and

2416
02:10:10.991 --> 02:10:12.760
fighting women.
And I said,

2417
02:10:12.820 --> 02:10:17.800
there's some physical advantages to the male frame that I think it's unfair and

2418
02:10:17.801 --> 02:10:22.180
it is also,
it's,
you have to divulge the fact that you used to be a man.

2419
02:10:22.450 --> 02:10:24.460
There's structural advantages to the male frame,

2420
02:10:24.461 --> 02:10:26.290
this mechanical advantages to the male frame,

2421
02:10:26.320 --> 02:10:29.440
especially when it comes to fighting.
And I think that that's not fair.

2422
02:10:29.570 --> 02:10:33.200
And people were so upset at me and then it's a medical issue and that it's been

2423
02:10:33.201 --> 02:10:37.640
proven that,
uh,
a man of trends becomes a transgender as a woman and a woman,

2424
02:10:37.641 --> 02:10:40.400
period.
And I'm like,
yeah,
no,
I don't think so.

2425
02:10:40.430 --> 02:10:44.030
I mean the frame that the width of the shoulders,
the size of the hands,

2426
02:10:44.150 --> 02:10:47.600
these things don't change.
And it takes a long time to change the bone density.

2427
02:10:47.720 --> 02:10:51.410
More than a decade of hormone therapy to show significant decreases in bone

2428
02:10:51.411 --> 02:10:52.130
density.

2429
02:10:52.130 --> 02:10:55.310
And they try to pretend that it's like some sort of an instantaneous thing that

2430
02:10:55.311 --> 02:10:57.020
you automatically become a woman.

2431
02:10:57.650 --> 02:11:01.700
But this woman who used to be a man looked like a man and a lot of ways,

2432
02:11:01.701 --> 02:11:05.300
a very wide,
broad shouldered and hit very hard.

2433
02:11:05.300 --> 02:11:08.060
And I think that's a lot of it is the mechanical advantage of the male frame.

2434
02:11:08.120 --> 02:11:11.030
Does it mean that a woman can't beat her?
No.
I mean,

2435
02:11:11.031 --> 02:11:15.680
or a cis woman as you would say?
No,
absolutely can.
And not only that,

2436
02:11:15.710 --> 02:11:18.230
I think she should be able to compete with them,
but I think it's a,

2437
02:11:18.231 --> 02:11:21.380
it's a matter of disclosure.
You can't not tell them that.

2438
02:11:21.530 --> 02:11:23.720
You can't just pretend you've been a woman your whole life.

2439
02:11:23.930 --> 02:11:27.800
I think when it comes to something along that line that's,
that's a big issue.

2440
02:11:27.920 --> 02:11:29.340
And that's how the current,

2441
02:11:29.690 --> 02:11:32.930
the current wave of sort of trans thought,

2442
02:11:32.931 --> 02:11:34.760
which is you know,

2443
02:11:34.761 --> 02:11:38.330
evolving and developing rapidly would say that it's hate speech for you to say

2444
02:11:38.331 --> 02:11:40.760
that this person wasn't a woman all her life,
well,

2445
02:11:40.761 --> 02:11:44.690
there weren't physically a woman.
That's reality that a penis,
they had muscles,

2446
02:11:44.691 --> 02:11:47.240
they had testosterone flowing freely through the testicles.
That's,

2447
02:11:47.260 --> 02:11:48.470
that's the reality.

2448
02:11:48.471 --> 02:11:53.450
The scientific reality of having the y chromosome and that is what a man is.

2449
02:11:53.451 --> 02:11:56.000
Whether they gender identified with being a female,

2450
02:11:56.001 --> 02:11:59.110
I'm not disputing that whatsoever and even if they looked like a man,

2451
02:11:59.111 --> 02:12:01.580
I'd be more than happy to call them and address them and think of them as a

2452
02:12:01.581 --> 02:12:02.960
woman.
I have no problem with that.

2453
02:12:03.120 --> 02:12:06.790
It just becomes to combat sports when it comes to combat sports.
When you,

2454
02:12:07.040 --> 02:12:09.770
there's a reason why men and women are a lot of fight each other.

2455
02:12:09.771 --> 02:12:12.710
It's because men have an advantage is a women's division in the men's division

2456
02:12:12.950 --> 02:12:13.740
and I don't,

2457
02:12:13.740 --> 02:12:17.330
I don't even have a problem with a woman fighting a man if they know,

2458
02:12:17.960 --> 02:12:19.070
if everybody knows what's going on.

2459
02:12:19.071 --> 02:12:21.950
If Rhonda Rousey decides to fight another hundred 35 pound man,

2460
02:12:22.100 --> 02:12:25.040
she's probably gonna beat the fuck out of the average 30 135 pounds.

2461
02:12:25.041 --> 02:12:26.390
I know nothing about this sport.

2462
02:12:26.391 --> 02:12:28.940
This is the first I've heard that there was a trans person in the sport.

2463
02:12:28.980 --> 02:12:31.970
I can't watch this sport,
but you,
but you've commented on it.

2464
02:12:31.971 --> 02:12:34.850
You said that a lot of people that watch it may be closeted gay.

2465
02:12:35.780 --> 02:12:36.950
Have I commented on?
Yes.

2466
02:12:37.580 --> 02:12:38.211
<v 3>Oh,
this is the,
the,</v>

2467
02:12:38.211 --> 02:12:42.470
the mixed martial arts with pumping on the floor while they're trying to kill

2468
02:12:42.471 --> 02:12:46.310
each other because you want to call it humping like you're doing too hot guys

2469
02:12:46.311 --> 02:12:49.760
end up in there like grabbing each other and rolling around on the Mat.

2470
02:12:49.790 --> 02:12:52.970
On the floor and inside the metal.
Yeah,
I have,
I've seen it.
I'm not light.

2471
02:12:52.971 --> 02:12:54.200
It's not a sport.
I follow much.

2472
02:12:54.500 --> 02:12:57.680
I seen it at my gym that I used to go to where they would have mixed martial

2473
02:12:57.681 --> 02:12:59.690
arts.
Is that what it's called?
Yes.
On all these screens.

2474
02:12:59.691 --> 02:13:02.660
And then I would go around and turn all the TVS to bravo when I was alone in the

2475
02:13:02.661 --> 02:13:05.620
gym at night.
In the morning when you're falling,

2476
02:13:05.621 --> 02:13:07.010
that allowed you to change the channel.

2477
02:13:07.011 --> 02:13:10.360
I would just stand there on the side of the TV until Kathy Griffith on Bravo.

2478
02:13:11.660 --> 02:13:13.160
I mean,
making this too much ago.

2479
02:13:14.660 --> 02:13:17.330
But you were saying that you thought that a lot of people that did MMA or

2480
02:13:17.331 --> 02:13:20.510
watched on I would probably just joking.
I was just cheesing.
Cause you know,

2481
02:13:20.600 --> 02:13:24.290
there's some people who are into Hypo Macho sports at any suggestion that there

2482
02:13:24.291 --> 02:13:27.140
could be anything gay about it or that even a gay person could get anything out

2483
02:13:27.141 --> 02:13:31.320
of it.
So you were trolling,
I was just trolling you son of a bitch.
Listen man,

2484
02:13:31.321 --> 02:13:32.220
we could do this a million

2485
02:13:32.220 --> 02:13:35.700
<v 1>times.
We could have a lot of really fun conversations even though we disagree on</v>

2486
02:13:35.701 --> 02:13:37.890
certain things.
A,
I respect your opinion very much.

2487
02:13:37.891 --> 02:13:40.770
And I think it's a very interesting point of view and a,

2488
02:13:40.771 --> 02:13:44.070
I think that a lot of these subjects,
I mean there's no definitive yes or no.

2489
02:13:44.071 --> 02:13:47.610
There's no right or wrong.
They're very nuanced and a really fun conversation

2490
02:13:47.650 --> 02:13:50.350
<v 3>really does and if you're ever in Seattle and you want to come on my podcast and</v>

2491
02:13:50.351 --> 02:13:53.200
give some sex advice,
I would love to love to have you.
Yeah,
definitely.

2492
02:13:53.201 --> 02:13:54.820
I love Seattle,
man.
I don't have it in the winter,

2493
02:13:54.821 --> 02:13:56.800
but I love in the summer it's one of the best places on earth.

2494
02:13:56.801 --> 02:14:00.760
It's winter right now.
You know what we call June in Seattle.
Wa January.
Why?

2495
02:14:00.940 --> 02:14:04.540
Because it's cold and raining.
Just like Jan.
Really?
Yeah.
It's been shitty.
Cold,

2496
02:14:04.541 --> 02:14:07.480
raining all month.
Does that freak people out that live there?

2497
02:14:07.481 --> 02:14:10.480
Because the people that I know that live there,
they all brush it off like,
no,

2498
02:14:10.481 --> 02:14:14.590
it's not.
It's awesome.
Come move here.
I'm like,
man,
I don't know man.
You fucking,

2499
02:14:14.591 --> 02:14:18.100
people tend to jump off buildings,
quiz.
It does get to some people.

2500
02:14:18.101 --> 02:14:21.100
What gets to me like a few years ago,
we basically didn't have a summer,

2501
02:14:21.250 --> 02:14:26.250
like January went into mid July and then and then it's became fall in September

2502
02:14:26.860 --> 02:14:27.211
1st there was no,

2503
02:14:27.211 --> 02:14:30.970
we had like four weeks where it was pretty decent out and kind of know summer

2504
02:14:31.390 --> 02:14:32.470
and that happens every once in a while.

2505
02:14:32.830 --> 02:14:35.190
So maybe global warming would be good for Seattle.
Oh,

2506
02:14:35.230 --> 02:14:37.630
global warming's going to be great for Canada and it's going to be great for

2507
02:14:37.631 --> 02:14:40.970
Washington state,
Minnesota.
It's going to suck for tax.

2508
02:14:40.971 --> 02:14:43.030
It's going to suck for all these places that don't believe in climate change.

2509
02:14:43.060 --> 02:14:45.010
Urban in Washington say,
it's like climate change is real.

2510
02:14:45.011 --> 02:14:47.020
We have to address it and we're going to be fine.

2511
02:14:47.021 --> 02:14:49.840
You fuckers in Texas who don't believe in climate change.
You're all good.

2512
02:14:50.410 --> 02:14:54.220
Don't listen to him.
Jesus going to take care of everything.
You all to be fine.

2513
02:14:54.221 --> 02:14:57.040
I need you to pray and pray for rain.

2514
02:14:57.340 --> 02:15:00.010
<v 1>The problem is you're not praying hard enough for rain and there's people like</v>

2515
02:15:00.011 --> 02:15:03.910
him sodomized and ruin in the whole fuck.
That's fine.
All right.

2516
02:15:04.030 --> 02:15:08.980
