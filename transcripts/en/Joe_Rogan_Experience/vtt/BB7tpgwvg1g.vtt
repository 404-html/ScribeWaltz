WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.700
But you let me know.
Oh,
cool.
And so,
yes sir.
Okay.
All right.

2
00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.950
And then we leave it there.
I think he'd beat too nervous.
Yeah,
like you said,

3
00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:11.120
boom.
And we're alive.
You FC motherfucker.
Bad away.
Champion,

4
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.130
Tj Dillashaw and Duane Ludwig masters splinter.

5
00:00:16.381 --> 00:00:19.800
What's up buddy?
Good to see you man.
You got golf shirts now to look at you.

6
00:00:19.801 --> 00:00:23.790
You respectable motherfucker.
I'm 40 now.
Oh my game.

7
00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.790
People walked in and I know Dojo.
He's got to look dressed to the nines.
You know,

8
00:00:26.791 --> 00:00:29.900
looking like it's a the job.
But there's a warning sign on the wall.

9
00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.520
Says explicit language.
Oh,
so you,

10
00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.760
you let people know people are going to be swearing up in this bitch.
Yes sir.

11
00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:39.520
Line up motherfuckers.
Dot.
On the map first though.

12
00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.440
Let see that when you teach classes,
do you swear I'm passionate?
Yeah.

13
00:00:43.441 --> 00:00:47.070
No you are or you get fired up.
That's why I don't teach the kids,

14
00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.310
the kids classes that coach that.
So you have a children's program?
Yes sir.

15
00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.370
Nice Dude.
I love the fact that you take regular classes.

16
00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.360
I've watched you on the Instagram bantamweight champion of the world.
Oh yeah.

17
00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.580
Regular regular classes with regular people.

18
00:01:02.581 --> 00:01:04.770
See they've been there with you like Holy Shit.
Yeah.

19
00:01:04.771 --> 00:01:08.350
Starstruck and weirded out go mandrills I love it.
I love,

20
00:01:08.351 --> 00:01:10.790
I mean obviously none of his classes or regular though.
You know what?

21
00:01:10.791 --> 00:01:12.630
Even if you're an average Joe coming up the street,

22
00:01:12.631 --> 00:01:15.780
like Duane is teaching you the same shit that I'm doing,
you know?
But yeah,

23
00:01:15.781 --> 00:01:18.390
working out with a guy that's never had a real fight before.

24
00:01:18.391 --> 00:01:20.320
You know what I mean?
He'll always remember that,
you know,

25
00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.310
always get to work out with me.
So it's,
it's uh,
it's cool,
man.

26
00:01:23.311 --> 00:01:25.150
I liked doing it and especially at Dwayne's Jim,

27
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.710
to kind of shows like the true love that I have for the system and being in

28
00:01:28.711 --> 00:01:29.431
there.
Yeah.
I mean,

29
00:01:29.431 --> 00:01:34.110
what kind of fucking sport other than MMA is that even possible?
Could point,

30
00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.730
right?
It was control Jujitsu.
You could do that,
but the people do.

31
00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.430
Most people don't know who the Jujitsu guys arm and you're fighting on fucking

32
00:01:41.431 --> 00:01:43.200
television all the time and it's almost,

33
00:01:43.201 --> 00:01:46.660
it's almost too easy to have that happen in this sport.
Now.

34
00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.280
There's people you should be,
you shouldn't be spot on with it.
It happens,

35
00:01:50.281 --> 00:01:52.230
you know,
that's why a controlled environments also awesome.

36
00:01:52.231 --> 00:01:55.860
That's why like did I feel like the small kind of training camps and teams that

37
00:01:55.861 --> 00:01:58.310
have been so beneficial because you knew exactly who you're working out with.

38
00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:59.790
Who are we getting better with?

39
00:01:59.791 --> 00:02:02.970
But there are times to work out with the average guys,
you know,

40
00:02:02.971 --> 00:02:06.480
not when I'm getting ready for a fight or don't want to get hurt,
you know,

41
00:02:06.481 --> 00:02:09.510
kind of thing.
And then his is a very controlled system when we're doing Dutch.

42
00:02:09.511 --> 00:02:13.740
Trills did,
uh,
it,
it's uh,
you're not going to go crazy,
you know,

43
00:02:13.741 --> 00:02:16.920
there's so many different approaches to training fighters.
Yes sir.

44
00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.110
And you obviously have hit,

45
00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.970
would you guys have like the best fighter trainer relationship that I know
about?

46
00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.780
Cause you guys are so tight.
It's like you guys are really a team.

47
00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.760
Whereas there's always some weird animosity with fighters and trainers and the,

48
00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.380
the blowups or just like Ben and women,
like when,

49
00:02:34.381 --> 00:02:37.350
when men and women break it up and you fucking bitch,
you fucking,

50
00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.310
you fucking fuck you.
Oh yeah,
that happens with,

51
00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:45.770
that makes me so sad when I see like fighter trainer blowouts when they separate

52
00:02:46.201 --> 00:02:49.710
and talk shit about each other like God,
that's,
so,
that's such a bummer.

53
00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:51.420
I think it's both of them having too big of an ego.

54
00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:54.690
One must be like the coach may be coaching the fighter wants to be more popular

55
00:02:54.691 --> 00:02:58.710
or whatever it may be,
you know?
Um,
and it just the,
I don't know,
whenever,

56
00:02:58.711 --> 00:03:01.720
whenever Dwayne came into the gym and as soon as he was there from the first

57
00:03:01.721 --> 00:03:04.380
practice,
I knew we were going to get along.
He's a crazy motherfucker.

58
00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.650
He likes to go hard.
I'm competitive and as kind of like everything I do.

59
00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:13.120
You know what,
you're also,
you have a very,
very well thought out system.

60
00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:14.200
Like I've been,

61
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.740
I was very impressed with like just your documentation of your system,

62
00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:19.480
how you have all these different things worked.

63
00:03:19.481 --> 00:03:21.550
At least these aren't like just happy.

64
00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.180
I mean there's obviously creative creativity involved when an actual fight is

65
00:03:25.181 --> 00:03:29.920
happening,
but your system is so well thought out.
And so

66
00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:31.960
<v 1>Bruh,
hence Iv,
I feel that's,</v>

67
00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:35.770
that's where I'm supposed to be doing is organizing the chaos of a fight so that

68
00:03:35.771 --> 00:03:37.630
the regular person can understand what's happening.

69
00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:39.460
When all was fighting and training,

70
00:03:39.461 --> 00:03:42.610
fighting was scary and I was very scared of it.

71
00:03:42.611 --> 00:03:44.260
So I want to make sure I understood what was going on.

72
00:03:44.261 --> 00:03:47.560
So I just started mapping it out and a lot of that came from Cynthia Rutan

73
00:03:47.561 --> 00:03:50.350
because he had the number system of three was jab,

74
00:03:50.351 --> 00:03:52.330
cross hook rather than three just been the left hook.

75
00:03:52.331 --> 00:03:56.600
So he sparked the initial interest to just start categorizing everything,

76
00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:58.360
put things into a system and it helped out.

77
00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:02.580
<v 0>He talks about it nonstop.
He doesn't sleep.
He's only one way to begin,</v>

78
00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:04.450
get a text message in the middle of the night.

79
00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:08.110
We're coming up to a fight and like it'd be like 12 one o'clock and it's even if

80
00:04:08.111 --> 00:04:10.900
he's in Colorado,
it's two o'clock for him.
And uh,

81
00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.670
getting a random text message or what I should be doing for this fight or what

82
00:04:13.671 --> 00:04:15.670
don't you like me?
He's watching sparring tapes of what I was doing.

83
00:04:15.671 --> 00:04:17.020
When you change this and change that.

84
00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:20.020
I mean this guy cares about our career just as much as I do and that's why it

85
00:04:20.021 --> 00:04:23.900
works.
You know,
I want him,
I want him to be some changes coming.
It's,

86
00:04:23.901 --> 00:04:26.950
it's a great thought out system but it like I've never had the same training

87
00:04:26.951 --> 00:04:31.810
camp and I don't ever have the same column when we have like your system base is

88
00:04:31.811 --> 00:04:33.400
the same but it always veers off.

89
00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.800
Like I don't even know what the Tj combos anymore.

90
00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:39.400
I think it's changed that changed things like eight times and so it's always

91
00:04:39.401 --> 00:04:40.980
like an add on or change.
So yeah.

92
00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.830
Well I remember the first time you fought hand and morale when you won the title

93
00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:49.660
and Dwayne and I had lunch together and it was a bunch of people at the table,

94
00:04:49.661 --> 00:04:52.840
but Duane didn't even know they were alive.
He wasn't even paying attention,

95
00:04:52.841 --> 00:04:54.880
who's just telling me exactly how it was going to go down.

96
00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.640
And he was just talking about all the things a bit in his hands are moving and

97
00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:00.820
shoulders are twitching,
is move it around back and forth.

98
00:05:00.821 --> 00:05:03.930
And he was going a hundred miles an hour with his voice.
It's bottled water,
blah,

99
00:05:03.931 --> 00:05:07.180
blah,
blah,
blah.
I was like,
wow,
dude,
you're geared up.
And he goes,

100
00:05:07.181 --> 00:05:10.300
he's gonna fuck him up.
He's going to fuck with that for sure.
I mean,

101
00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:13.270
you see the emotion that he shows inside doctor on an African fights,
you know,

102
00:05:13.271 --> 00:05:16.870
so,
uh,
that's how much he cares going into.
That's on nervous.
He is,
you know.
Um,

103
00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:17.951
and like I said,

104
00:05:17.951 --> 00:05:20.650
if you have a coach that cares that much about you and your career,

105
00:05:20.651 --> 00:05:22.840
then you don't let it go.
Yeah.
When you were,

106
00:05:22.841 --> 00:05:25.270
when you were in Sacramento and then you move to Colorado,

107
00:05:25.271 --> 00:05:27.460
you have basically kind of had to start from scratch.

108
00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.780
A lot of people obviously know who you are.
You are well sought out a trainer,

109
00:05:31.781 --> 00:05:35.290
but you were opening up your own place from scratch and now that place is

110
00:05:35.291 --> 00:05:37.010
fucking mobbed and you're expanding.

111
00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:39.800
<v 1>Yeah.
Yes sir.
Yeah,
we're expanding and uh,</v>

112
00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:43.090
just continuing to grow and have a good positive outlet for people to explore

113
00:05:43.091 --> 00:05:47.800
their soul.
Right.
Uh,
that's why I'm here is to teach martial arts.
So it's a,

114
00:05:47.801 --> 00:05:49.960
I'm glad everyone else's is realizing that as well.

115
00:05:49.961 --> 00:05:51.430
And I can cross paths with the,

116
00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:55.060
and then just like Tj Dillashaw and helped them become better martial artists.

117
00:05:55.061 --> 00:05:58.250
And it's just the good,
um,
you know,
100% living,
living,

118
00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:02.300
living vicariously through te Jane on my athletes and everybody under the BMT

119
00:06:02.301 --> 00:06:02.661
umbrella.

120
00:06:02.661 --> 00:06:07.280
And it's a good way to give back and basically relive and other career for the

121
00:06:07.281 --> 00:06:10.110
most part.
Right.
So,
and that's what we should be doing anyways,

122
00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:14.090
paying the positive lessons forward and onto the next generation.
And that's,
uh,

123
00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:17.240
that's the definition of Sensei actually,
meaning history teacher,
teacher,

124
00:06:17.241 --> 00:06:19.550
you know,
from those who've come before you.
So,

125
00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:23.270
and to have somebody like Tj is dedicated as he is,
it's,
it's a true blessing.

126
00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:26.540
And uh,
that's why I'm all in.
He's all in.
I'm all in,
let's go.

127
00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:27.031
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

128
00:06:27.031 --> 00:06:31.350
Well it's just rare that you find all in coach and all in fighter and they get

129
00:06:31.351 --> 00:06:34.370
together and you guys have such unique working.
I'm,
well,

130
00:06:34.371 --> 00:06:37.070
I'm more than all in the same with you.
And I'm going to dictate,
you know,
like,

131
00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:41.070
like if I'm not completely like full blown into it,

132
00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:43.710
I mentally am fucked when I get home.
You know,

133
00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:49.050
y'all coming off of this second victory over Cody and then being able to stop

134
00:06:49.051 --> 00:06:51.220
him even quicker this time and the,

135
00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:56.230
and just all the crazy shit talking that led up to that fight and the results of

136
00:06:56.281 --> 00:06:57.150
the first fight.

137
00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:02.280
I mean that's got to be very satisfying to you that everything is going

138
00:07:02.281 --> 00:07:05.790
according to plan.
Absolutely man.
Um,
it is,

139
00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:07.890
especially with the whole build up,
you know,

140
00:07:07.891 --> 00:07:10.120
it was like two years of just bullshit having to deal with that man.

141
00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:12.120
That's not the kind of person I am.
You know,

142
00:07:12.121 --> 00:07:14.850
I'd really be in the mountains that you not be able to get ahold of me hunting

143
00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:18.990
or just camping and like if I,
if I could disappear,
I take advantage to do it,

144
00:07:18.991 --> 00:07:19.171
you know,

145
00:07:19.171 --> 00:07:23.730
so that crazy attention and just like the shit talk and the TV show them

146
00:07:23.731 --> 00:07:26.760
accusing me of everything.
Like,
you know,
that took a lot,
you know?

147
00:07:26.761 --> 00:07:28.890
And so for all that to be like taken off my shoulders,

148
00:07:28.891 --> 00:07:30.420
it feels great for you though.

149
00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:35.300
There's God that's gotta be a real feeling of like retribution to look.

150
00:07:35.301 --> 00:07:38.220
No matter what they said,
you had the right idea,

151
00:07:38.221 --> 00:07:41.130
they might not have been happy that you decided to do it for yourself.

152
00:07:41.131 --> 00:07:45.630
And the right move for yourself was to go and go to Colorado and be with Dwayne.

153
00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:49.020
But obviously you were right.
Yeah.
Oh,
100% I was right.

154
00:07:49.021 --> 00:07:51.030
I mean that's why I made the decision.
I'm definitely,

155
00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:54.270
and you've got to be selfish in this,
this sport.

156
00:07:54.271 --> 00:07:57.750
He got to do what's best for yourself.
And some ways without fucking people over,

157
00:07:57.751 --> 00:08:00.450
you have to be self.
Of course,
we got to know what's best for you.

158
00:08:00.451 --> 00:08:03.690
And so the ultimate decision for me was when I got an ultimatum,
you know,

159
00:08:03.691 --> 00:08:06.170
like Uriah knew how much I like training with Duane.

160
00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:09.780
He knew how great it was for my mentality and we just vibed right away,
you know?

161
00:08:09.781 --> 00:08:12.570
And they didn't.
And so when he gave me the ultimatum like,
look man,

162
00:08:12.571 --> 00:08:14.730
you're there doing your camper,
Dwayne are doing with us.
I was like,

163
00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:17.580
well then you don't have my best interests in heart.
I'm Outta here.
You know,

164
00:08:17.581 --> 00:08:21.000
like I sold my house,
bought when I moved out to Colorado,

165
00:08:21.001 --> 00:08:22.630
like I dropped everything and went yeah,

166
00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:26.970
that was tough and I was a tough situation to go through and uh,
I,
yeah,

167
00:08:26.971 --> 00:08:28.920
I made the right choice.
Well,
your,

168
00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:33.060
your decision and the way you approached it was very similar to what you were

169
00:08:33.061 --> 00:08:34.620
doing too.
Because when I talked to you,
you're like,

170
00:08:34.621 --> 00:08:36.000
I'm gonna open up my own gym and Colorado.

171
00:08:36.001 --> 00:08:39.030
And I remember thinking whenever someone thinks they're going to start from

172
00:08:39.031 --> 00:08:43.290
scratch with a new gym by themselves,
I'm like,
Ooh.
I mean,
I wish you well,

173
00:08:43.291 --> 00:08:46.200
but damn,
that's a lot of work,
you know,
as well as anybody.

174
00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:47.840
<v 1>Yes sir.
I've,
I've known since I was a kid,</v>

175
00:08:47.841 --> 00:08:50.930
I was going to be a world champion and have my own academy and Colorado check,

176
00:08:50.931 --> 00:08:51.764
check

177
00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:54.750
<v 0>darting a gym is tough,
man.
We're,
we're doing it now while we're,</v>

178
00:08:54.830 --> 00:08:56.970
we've going through it for the last year,

179
00:08:56.970 --> 00:09:01.120
<v 2>year and a half down here in southern California.
So the new places called,
uh,</v>

180
00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:05.000
the training lab,
the training lab is spelled funny.
It's got where Eui and rain,

181
00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:10.360
cause Mark Munoz had rain down in lake forest and Sam Kalvia,

182
00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:13.770
the guy that I moved down for,
for her strength conditioning and just his,

183
00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:17.760
his crazy mind,
he's beyond smart,
like heal everything he talks about,

184
00:09:17.761 --> 00:09:20.100
like I have to be at his house for hours,

185
00:09:20.101 --> 00:09:22.680
pretty much doing a podcast with him to figure out what he's talking about.

186
00:09:22.681 --> 00:09:25.470
And usually always goes over your head.
You know,
I've gone,
like I said,

187
00:09:25.471 --> 00:09:27.300
I'm always full blown.
I made 100%.

188
00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:30.900
And so as soon as he started showing me the science behind what my body needs to

189
00:09:30.901 --> 00:09:35.690
do,
if it were from my diet,
my recovery,
um,
the days I'm working out,
my,

190
00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:38.400
the way I'm doing my strength conditioning and what if I'm going to go bigger or

191
00:09:38.401 --> 00:09:41.520
how far I am from camp.
Like everything has a rhyme and reason.

192
00:09:41.521 --> 00:09:44.280
Like every calorie I eat,
every macronutrients I eat.

193
00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:46.560
He's got it down and written down.
He's like,

194
00:09:46.561 --> 00:09:51.060
this guy stays up late and works in and he doesn't do it for the money or the

195
00:09:51.061 --> 00:09:54.090
pride.
Like he doesn't want anything.
Like we do it out of his garage.
You know,

196
00:09:54.091 --> 00:09:56.910
it's like an old rocky style training with Drago Science.

197
00:09:56.940 --> 00:10:00.720
I saw that on the UFC countdown videos,
man out in the park.
You know,

198
00:10:00.721 --> 00:10:01.554
we're doing crazy.

199
00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:04.890
Yesterday I was out in the park with them doing a bunch of crazy stuff and a lot

200
00:10:04.891 --> 00:10:09.420
of reaction time stuff.
And uh,
just the way he trains his very,
very scientific.

201
00:10:09.421 --> 00:10:13.350
And I've seen the gains insanely for as old as I am.

202
00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:16.260
I'm the strongest and fastest I've ever been told,
you know,

203
00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:20.680
32 and I've been trained since I was eight.
You know,
I never got into diet,

204
00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:24.630
never got an Indian of this until I started picking Sam's brain.
And,
uh,

205
00:10:25.050 --> 00:10:28.230
I think the real,
I mean,
everything's,
it's not bro science either.
We're not like,

206
00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:32.280
oh,
I think I feel better.
I'm testing myself,
you know,
I've,
I boosted my hormones.

207
00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:34.350
I wasn't able to get my wife pregnant for three years.

208
00:10:34.351 --> 00:10:37.660
And it happened in three months after meeting Sam.
Like I went full blown.

209
00:10:37.661 --> 00:10:40.980
I went so full blown that I created my own like spice company around his diet.

210
00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:44.190
You know,
like,
I don't see,
well,
what does he got you doing differently?

211
00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:47.220
How were you eating before and what were you doing before for strength and

212
00:10:47.221 --> 00:10:49.950
conditioning before you met him?
Um,
so it was,

213
00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:54.000
I didn't care about what I eat.
I was,
I don't cut much weight,
you know,

214
00:10:54.001 --> 00:10:56.470
three fives isn't a very big cut for me.
So you walk around it,

215
00:10:56.580 --> 00:10:59.550
I'm like right now private,
a couple one 50 this morning.
Um,

216
00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:02.010
that's a little bit lighter than normal.
I haven't been to my,
I have to,

217
00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:03.530
I bulk up to go 35.

218
00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:06.750
I put on another like good five pounds of muscle before I start to even worry

219
00:11:06.751 --> 00:11:11.610
about my weight at 35.
Um,
but I was just eating whatever,
you know.

220
00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:13.980
Um,
and I used to make fun to Danny for being gluten free.

221
00:11:13.981 --> 00:11:17.220
If like gimme more gluten,
I don't care.
I'll eat whatever I want.
And the best,

222
00:11:17.221 --> 00:11:19.920
you know,
I'll just train hard,
train hard and everyone,
but,
uh,

223
00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:22.860
not only my age but just the learning the science behind it.

224
00:11:22.861 --> 00:11:24.870
And I'm not eating grains,
you know,

225
00:11:24.871 --> 00:11:29.400
no sugars unless it's a simple as like a from fruits and stuff like that.
Um,

226
00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:32.940
yeah man.
I mean it,
it's,
it's a special diet.

227
00:11:32.941 --> 00:11:36.200
I'd say like the clue you like almost go like Paleo Keto Kinda.

228
00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:39.450
But obviously our bodies can't do that because I need the simple cards and you

229
00:11:39.451 --> 00:11:42.090
carbs are run off and stuff.
But uh,
yeah,
I mean he's really,

230
00:11:42.091 --> 00:11:44.090
I don't want to give away all the secrets,
but yeah,
man,
he's,

231
00:11:44.091 --> 00:11:47.460
he's changed up a lot with me.
If you don't want to give away all our secrets,

232
00:11:47.461 --> 00:11:50.900
but when it comes to nutrition,
like what is,
what is different,

233
00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:54.070
what kind of protein easy have you eating?
What portions of protein,
how

234
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:57.370
<v 0>much of it is fat?
Well,
you're getting your fat from avocado,
coconut oil.</v>

235
00:11:57.371 --> 00:12:00.340
What do you get it from?
Oh yeah,
a lot.
A lot of,
and not another,

236
00:12:00.341 --> 00:12:05.170
it's not a coconut oils.
Um,
uh,
they even pre make my meals,

237
00:12:05.171 --> 00:12:08.410
so I don't really,
I don't even think about what meals I'm meeting Jesus Christ.

238
00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:11.190
It has all three of my meals and two of my snacks every day.
And you just,

239
00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:13.960
you live in that area when you're in training camp?
Yes.
Yeah.

240
00:12:13.961 --> 00:12:18.610
So I just bought a house in Yorba Linda area.
Yeah.
I love it.
It's amazing.

241
00:12:18.611 --> 00:12:22.930
It's a real good family area,
good school district.
So,
um,
that's how you know,

242
00:12:22.931 --> 00:12:24.940
your life has changed when you're looking at houses for school districts.

243
00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:28.350
Trust being a,
being a father's gaze,

244
00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:32.650
lucky change the whole shifting of your world.
It's everything.
Yeah.

245
00:12:32.651 --> 00:12:34.420
I mean it's everything.
That's all you think about,
you know,

246
00:12:34.421 --> 00:12:37.390
it takes a while to be realized.
You were a different person.
Like,
oh,

247
00:12:37.391 --> 00:12:38.590
I'm a different person than I used to be.

248
00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:41.040
I remember you made a comment before saying that those,
uh,

249
00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:45.070
an old banana or a freshman or something was a bit from my act.

250
00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:47.040
Is that what it was?
That's when I realized some of that,

251
00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:50.920
there was two bananas and one of them was like yellow and perfect.

252
00:12:50.921 --> 00:12:54.700
And the other one was brown and fucked up.
But my daughter loves bananas.

253
00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:00.000
So I took that Brown fucked up banana and I ate it because I realized that I

254
00:13:00.851 --> 00:13:04.060
was,
I was putting her above me and that that was,

255
00:13:04.061 --> 00:13:07.390
I never thought about that before.
And then I said because I love my wife,

256
00:13:07.391 --> 00:13:10.270
she's an awesome person but if it's just me and her,

257
00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:12.070
that bitch is getting a shitty banana.

258
00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:19.410
That's what I tried to Frickin Subaru car cause it's got five star crash rating

259
00:13:19.411 --> 00:13:23.590
and good in the snow.
Yeah.
I think of the kids first.
Subaru,

260
00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:27.620
Dave own Denver,
Colorado,
Colorado.

261
00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:29.020
Get a Tesla.

262
00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:33.660
Oh supporting the podcast guys drop 50 grand.
You know you,

263
00:13:33.850 --> 00:13:36.310
you go on the website,
you punch the information,

264
00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:39.340
you put in $1,000 deposit and then you got to wait for a while for it to be

265
00:13:39.341 --> 00:13:41.410
built.
So it's not like I dropped 50 grand,

266
00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:43.090
ended up going to lease it to the business anyway.

267
00:13:43.091 --> 00:13:46.780
But I've been wanting to get one for awhile.
It's funny men how Subarus,

268
00:13:46.810 --> 00:13:50.810
like they've proven themselves in Colorado just for reliability.
Awesome.
Yup.

269
00:13:51.070 --> 00:13:54.580
There,
you know,
ton of old ones still floating around everywhere.
Literally,

270
00:13:54.581 --> 00:13:59.140
if you go through boulder,
it's like 50% Subarus.
I would say that.
Yeah.
They just,

271
00:13:59.170 --> 00:14:02.830
they've just said,
let's just cut the shit.
Yes.
One is the best in snow.

272
00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:06.840
Let's stop fucking around.
They never break fucking Japanese cars made.

273
00:14:06.841 --> 00:14:11.230
They never,
I've had three Lexuses.
Never had a single problem with any of them.

274
00:14:11.231 --> 00:14:11.700
That's good.

275
00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:16.700
They'll for like 1520 years I've had Alexis's they never fuck up perfect.

276
00:14:17.050 --> 00:14:21.850
They just start,
or every time no fuck ups.
300,000 miles on it.

277
00:14:21.851 --> 00:14:22.840
It's still going to run.
Yeah.

278
00:14:22.841 --> 00:14:25.750
Other cards you get in the windows rolled halfway down.
What the fuck's going on?

279
00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:28.720
Dang.
Dang.
Dang.
Lights go off of the dashboard.
What is this?

280
00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:34.720
Put black tape over it.
You want to see it in a more,
yeah.
Oh yeah.
Well,
you know,

281
00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:38.450
I dunno.
It's gotta be difficult to build cars.
Speaking of cars do,

282
00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:40.840
does everybody know you have that fucking thing outside of you look at a lot of

283
00:14:40.841 --> 00:14:42.790
talk about,
Oh yeah,
I'm going to talk about it.
Yeah.

284
00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:47.200
You got one of my favorite cars ever.
NSX.
It's amazing car things.

285
00:14:47.201 --> 00:14:51.770
A space ship.
It really is man.
Real space ship.

286
00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:56.000
It's a real fun car,
doesn't it?
What are we talking about?
It has four engines.

287
00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:59.870
Three of them are electric.
I mean,
it is a crazy,
at that tree,

288
00:14:59.871 --> 00:15:03.680
Turbo v six I mean it's only got a high five hundreds and horsepower.

289
00:15:04.270 --> 00:15:05.103
Look at that fun,

290
00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:10.270
but it high 500 Corecon is insane because it's,
uh,
it's a,

291
00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:12.350
uh,
two electric motors,
so I have to start,

292
00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:16.190
it's so fast to zero to 60 in 2.9 seconds.
That's fast,
dude.

293
00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:18.950
So good looking too.
I love the way they look.

294
00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:22.820
They look like a car that's supposed to be built in 2018 you know what I mean?

295
00:15:22.821 --> 00:15:24.320
It's like that Shit's from the future.

296
00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:28.130
It took them a long time to create that car and when they stopped making the,

297
00:15:28.170 --> 00:15:32.450
the second generation of sex,
like what,
2005 I had one.
Oh,
did you?
Yeah,

298
00:15:32.510 --> 00:15:34.320
that's why to,
yeah.
Yeah.

299
00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:39.500
I had one in the early nineties and then I had one in 2003.
Okay.
Yeah,

300
00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:41.660
we'll,
we'll uh,
did you like the early 90?

301
00:15:41.661 --> 00:15:44.210
[inaudible] I like the headlights better than the newer one.
Okay.

302
00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:47.810
But they're all awesome.
Yeah.
They're just,
it's not a fast car.

303
00:15:48.050 --> 00:15:52.400
Like if you buy it,
I think in a 270 horsepower.
Okay.
But it's all aluminum.

304
00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:56.900
It's mid engine.
It sounds amazing when it gets high,
like hot in the high revs,

305
00:15:57.050 --> 00:16:01.880
but it doesn't sound like,
it's not like a,
like an old Mustang.

306
00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:05.210
It's like full like metal.
Is it driving the street?

307
00:16:05.211 --> 00:16:09.380
It's like a sophisticated sound,
but a cool sound.
The vtech engine,

308
00:16:09.770 --> 00:16:13.070
that was my one problem with the new NSX was how quiet it was cause it's a

309
00:16:13.071 --> 00:16:15.080
hybrid.
So I'm like,
like I said,

310
00:16:15.081 --> 00:16:17.870
it was a one of three cars in the United States right now that have a custom

311
00:16:17.871 --> 00:16:21.550
exhaust forward and make it sound a lot better.
This guy on Chicago a be rogue,

312
00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:25.820
I think it is,
um,
has designed a,
uh,
an exhaust for it.
You know,

313
00:16:25.821 --> 00:16:27.650
that car is also,
even though it's an accurate,

314
00:16:27.651 --> 00:16:31.160
their car is made in design in the United States.
Yeah.
The factories in Ohio,

315
00:16:31.161 --> 00:16:36.050
right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's a total American car under the accurate.

316
00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:39.820
What is American anymore?
I mean I don't,
I don't even understand this.

317
00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:42.710
How we order stuff.
It's always from China or Pakistan or something so,

318
00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:45.680
but it's also like the parks like are all the parts made here?

319
00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:49.850
Everything you know like assembled.
That's an issue with Harley Davidson,
right?

320
00:16:49.851 --> 00:16:51.890
Trump wants us to ban Harley Davidson's now.

321
00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:55.370
I didn't boycott boycott Holly Davidson.
Really?
Yeah.

322
00:16:55.371 --> 00:16:59.180
Cause Harley Davidson is going to shift their factories to somewhere to make

323
00:16:59.181 --> 00:17:00.940
some part of it or maybe all of it.

324
00:17:00.950 --> 00:17:05.210
We talk about the Elon Musk and saving the world.
I don't know.
I don't,

325
00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:07.040
I don't think anybody could do Trump's job.

326
00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:09.290
I don't think anybody could be president.
I think it's stupid.

327
00:17:09.291 --> 00:17:12.260
There's no way to ask one person to have that much responsibility.
Yes.

328
00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:16.670
That person in these big 10 15 people to handle that job for sure.

329
00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:21.260
Maybe 30 there's no way I'd ever want the pressure of that.
That job.

330
00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:24.800
Fuck that.
How much he's actually doing though.
I don't want it.

331
00:17:24.801 --> 00:17:25.720
How much pussies getting?

332
00:17:26.570 --> 00:17:29.890
I really want to know cause I don't think he's just stopped getting pussy.

333
00:17:29.910 --> 00:17:34.100
He's like Trump for sure.
You know on the roll there's gotta be,

334
00:17:34.101 --> 00:17:38.210
I mean what the him and Melania is still hook up and she seems upset with them.

335
00:17:38.570 --> 00:17:42.120
It's interesting as a drama has watched it all go down like cause his date

336
00:17:42.121 --> 00:17:45.320
investigation closing in on them or they're going to put them in jail or is he

337
00:17:45.321 --> 00:17:48.620
going to be like fuck you,
I'm getting my special flying away.

338
00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:51.320
Sure he has a spaceship.

339
00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:54.930
Well if he does and he's trying to find out if he can get one on the gold one

340
00:17:54.931 --> 00:17:59.931
that says Trump on this quick bailed on him when they got out of the Paris

341
00:18:00.931 --> 00:18:05.330
accord.
Yeah,
the climate accord.
I don't,
yeah,

342
00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:06.450
I don't know enough about this.

343
00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:09.750
I don't know how your brain holds on even that much information.
Either member.

344
00:18:09.950 --> 00:18:13.260
Everything I remember too much.
It's a problem.
I don't remember shit.

345
00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:18.270
But like my wife will tell me from Tuesday,
my wife,
he told me that she's like,

346
00:18:18.271 --> 00:18:19.110
we're standing right here.

347
00:18:19.111 --> 00:18:21.870
She'll like go over all the details cause she remembers all of it.
I'm like,
okay,

348
00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:24.270
I guess you're right.
We'll get it off.

349
00:18:26.010 --> 00:18:30.600
But I'll tell you in 1852 exactly.
Exactly.
Awesome facts and stats,

350
00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:33.600
some stupid stats when it comes to martial arts.

351
00:18:33.601 --> 00:18:37.290
I feel like I understand have a good grasp on what's happening.

352
00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:40.350
But the outside of martial arts,
I don't know that much.
Yeah.

353
00:18:40.351 --> 00:18:43.720
But that's probably good man.
You know,
I think there's something there.

354
00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:47.760
There's some real power in that.
Having a singular focus.

355
00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.360
I think in order to be great at something,
you have to be that way.

356
00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:55.140
I wouldn't be spread dealer,
but I would say very dominantly focused.

357
00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:58.920
I think you're right because I would,
if I was only thinking about MMA,

358
00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:01.620
I would not be here.
Good point.
Right?

359
00:19:01.621 --> 00:19:05.970
Like you need some other things that interest you to relieve the pressure have

360
00:19:05.971 --> 00:19:09.960
to,
otherwise it's too much and you snap.
What is the best one for you?

361
00:19:10.370 --> 00:19:11.720
They escape wise.
Yeah.
Uh,

362
00:19:11.910 --> 00:19:16.910
jumping on my Malibu boat and my backyard and Colorado and wake surfing or

363
00:19:17.310 --> 00:19:19.290
hunting,
both those I getting out.

364
00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:21.810
I just went and hiked around in the mountains of Colorado for,

365
00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:25.230
I only got to do two and a half day cause I'm too busy.
But by myself,

366
00:19:25.231 --> 00:19:27.600
no one else.
First time ever Hyundai area.

367
00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:31.230
I scouted it like three days before camp,
but just went out by myself.
Could,

368
00:19:31.231 --> 00:19:32.910
didn't have a cell phone reception,
nothing.

369
00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:36.000
Just to your own thoughts for two and a half days.
So this type of year,

370
00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:38.610
this time of year,
our tree mule deer,
was that what it was?
Yeah.

371
00:19:38.611 --> 00:19:43.020
So I tried to get an elk tag in Colorado,
but I didn't draw,
I did draw a meal,

372
00:19:43.021 --> 00:19:47.190
deer tag for the same area.
Um,
but it,
it's so it's heavily dominated elk,

373
00:19:47.191 --> 00:19:49.140
so it's hard.
He and mule deer there.
Yeah.

374
00:19:49.141 --> 00:19:51.780
It's hard to get those two to coincide with each other,
but that's,

375
00:19:51.810 --> 00:19:54.720
that's hard hunting.
That's what mountain hunting.
That's the real deal.
Yeah,
man.

376
00:19:54.721 --> 00:19:59.090
I mean you're going from 8,000 to 10,
11,
12,000 feet,
you know,

377
00:19:59.590 --> 00:20:02.370
hike two or three of those mountains and your toes when you get back.
Hey Man,

378
00:20:02.371 --> 00:20:06.760
when you do that,
bring that.
I'm shroom tech sport.
Um,
on a trim tech sport,

379
00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:09.990
any cordyceps mushroom supplement,
anything along those lines.

380
00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:14.720
That's literally how it came about.
They realize these high altitude,
uh,

381
00:20:14.790 --> 00:20:18.360
cattle herders were realizing that their cows were more active when they were

382
00:20:18.361 --> 00:20:21.120
eating these certain mushrooms.
And that's a quarter subs mushroom.

383
00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:23.150
We actually grow,
we don't grow,
but you know,
we,

384
00:20:23.550 --> 00:20:27.780
the company buys it from some growers to grow it off caterpillars.
Oh,
no way.

385
00:20:28.050 --> 00:20:31.590
They're going off the caterpillar.
It's fucking weird shit,
man.

386
00:20:31.650 --> 00:20:33.900
All quarter set mushrooms are grown that way.
I don't know about all,

387
00:20:33.901 --> 00:20:37.410
but a lot of them.
That's crazy.
Yeah.
They grow them on caterpillars,

388
00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:41.600
so they're definitely not vegan.
You know what I mean?

389
00:20:41.910 --> 00:20:45.510
I take shroom tech.
Is that a plant based?

390
00:20:45.511 --> 00:20:47.440
Like it's fungal based.
Okay.

391
00:20:48.030 --> 00:20:50.080
<v 3>Mushroom done mushrooms.</v>

392
00:20:50.770 --> 00:20:54.250
They take in air and they breathe out carbon dioxide like we do.

393
00:20:54.430 --> 00:20:56.620
They're closer to the animals in the art to plants.

394
00:20:57.340 --> 00:21:01.630
This is a whole different cat you've ever listened to.
Paul Stamets.
Oh my God,

395
00:21:01.631 --> 00:21:06.520
I did a podcast with him.
Strap yourself in,
take three hits,
hold on tight,

396
00:21:06.610 --> 00:21:11.560
buckled down and listen to that guy's podcast.
He's a real mycologist.

397
00:21:11.561 --> 00:21:15.310
I had an actual scientist who studies mushrooms and he's amazing.

398
00:21:15.311 --> 00:21:17.850
So that's how cordyceps mushrooms are grown.
Okay.

399
00:21:18.550 --> 00:21:21.610
Where's the caterpillar underneath that?
You can just buy it as a culture.
Oh,

400
00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:24.670
that's a culture of them.
Thought it would have a caterpillar in there.
Oh,
okay.

401
00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:28.210
So this is uh,
for your,
for your home you could,
that's probably even better,

402
00:21:28.211 --> 00:21:32.650
right?
Get it fresh.
I don't know how to make it either.
A lot of dudes,

403
00:21:32.651 --> 00:21:34.870
gross rooms,
so it's pretty easy apparently,

404
00:21:36.370 --> 00:21:41.110
but just it's a phenomenal supplement and if you're doing anything high

405
00:21:41.111 --> 00:21:44.530
altitude,
he will absolutely increase your endurance.

406
00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:47.710
That is one of the only supplements that I'll tell people.
Look,

407
00:21:47.711 --> 00:21:51.070
if you're skeptical about any of this shit,
please,
I want you to,

408
00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:55.840
before you work out an hour before you take four shroom tech sports and get

409
00:21:55.841 --> 00:21:57.730
ready because you're going to have an extra gear.

410
00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:01.890
You got one extra gear and training.
It's like one Bush.

411
00:22:02.590 --> 00:22:06.310
I take it before every session.
With Tj,
it's from tech and Alpha brain.

412
00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:10.660
It's a 12,
it's cordyceps,
mushrooms,
B12 and adaptogens.

413
00:22:10.661 --> 00:22:13.990
And those are all really important things for energy.
So it was,

414
00:22:14.050 --> 00:22:18.430
does California have you do an all kinds of supplementation and what does he got

415
00:22:18.431 --> 00:22:19.360
you a taking?

416
00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:22.720
<v 2>So everyone's got a different supplement plan because he does a hair analysis</v>

417
00:22:22.721 --> 00:22:25.630
from us and decided Jesus Christ is assign.
He,
oh he really,

418
00:22:25.631 --> 00:22:28.180
everything's got numbers man.
Every they are now.
So yeah.

419
00:22:28.820 --> 00:22:30.940
So my supplement based would be different than Dwayne's.

420
00:22:30.941 --> 00:22:33.130
I mean a lot of us have that we have at the same Aminos,

421
00:22:33.131 --> 00:22:36.970
we have the same is creatine obviously depending on where you're going for
fight.

422
00:22:37.030 --> 00:22:39.160
Um,
you know,
that kind of stuff.

423
00:22:39.161 --> 00:22:41.830
But when it comes down to what's in your body mineral wise,

424
00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:43.370
like I might have more magnesium,

425
00:22:43.371 --> 00:22:46.540
more and more this and more that it gets her body back to homeostasis.

426
00:22:46.541 --> 00:22:49.710
So we'll take out.
We have too much of,
I might need more vitamin B.

427
00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:53.720
Be examples like things you didn't,
you have too much of.
I have.

428
00:22:53.820 --> 00:22:57.300
Well I have too much arsenic in my body.
Oh,
what were you eating?
Um,

429
00:22:57.320 --> 00:22:59.830
I think it's rice.
I think the rice has given a lot of,

430
00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:04.620
because rice is heavily because it's grown in water and so the arsenic,

431
00:23:06.490 --> 00:23:10.180
yeah.
Yeah.
So I think it's the right,
it could be from my tattoos as well.

432
00:23:10.210 --> 00:23:13.930
I mean tattoo.
Yeah,
the ink has arsenic in it.
I'm fucked.

433
00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:15.640
Yeah,
man.

434
00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:19.750
The only person that have more arsenic in my body than me in our camp was a cub

435
00:23:19.751 --> 00:23:24.150
Swanson.
Wow.
And he's all covered his whole back and stuff.
Yeah.
Yeah.

436
00:23:24.250 --> 00:23:28.240
Dad is crazy.
Now.
Did,
what?
Did they find a way to eliminate it?

437
00:23:28.241 --> 00:23:30.490
Can you eliminate it?
Yeah,
so I'm taking a while.

438
00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:33.040
I'm taking a lot of different stuff for it,
but I'm taking chlorella.

439
00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:37.660
I juice everyday.
I juice Cilantro.
So launches are good for heavy metals.

440
00:23:37.661 --> 00:23:41.060
Getting a detox.
Um,
I'm taking methionine,

441
00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:45.530
which is like Amino to pull it out of your body.
And then he's got drops.

442
00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:48.850
I'm on that.
Don't even know what they are now.
Have you got a second test?

443
00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:53.390
And it's come down by over 50% oh wow.
Yeah,
I had.
Oh.

444
00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:58.070
So if it's still in your system and it's not,
you're not eating rice anymore,

445
00:23:58.370 --> 00:24:01.150
so it's gotta be from your tattoos?
Yeah,
it could be.
I mean,

446
00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:02.830
or is it just slowly take,

447
00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:05.810
you can't so you can do a correlation where they do it by ivy,

448
00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:08.810
but that stuff's like,
it's hard.
It's hard on y'all,
how fast it comes out.

449
00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:12.280
So it comes out in like pimples.
It'll come out.
Like when I'm on it,

450
00:24:12.550 --> 00:24:13.680
it started coming out of my arm.

451
00:24:13.681 --> 00:24:16.460
Like it would mainly I'd get pimples throughout my arm and that's kind of your

452
00:24:16.461 --> 00:24:19.550
body pushing it.
You also push it out through your urine and things like that,

453
00:24:19.551 --> 00:24:23.990
but it'll come out of your skin.
Arsenic exit son.
Yeah.
Yeah.

454
00:24:24.410 --> 00:24:27.110
I've tested for arsenic wants cause,
but I was eating sardines.

455
00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:29.650
I was eating a lot of sardines and apparently they,

456
00:24:29.670 --> 00:24:33.890
they live around the bottom of the ocean and they kept a lot of the heavy metal

457
00:24:33.891 --> 00:24:37.820
poisonings from that way.
That's crazy.
But it makes sense with Rice.

458
00:24:37.850 --> 00:24:41.290
That totally makes sense.
Yeah.
But everyone's got different supplements like a,

459
00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:43.270
it just depends on what's in your body.
Like how,
like,

460
00:24:43.310 --> 00:24:46.440
what you need to get back to perfect homeostasis,
right.
And then he adds like,

461
00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:50.840
you know,
the certain Amino body or muscle building and,
and um,

462
00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:55.320
ubiquinol and the Krill oils and things like that for um,
building red,

463
00:24:55.370 --> 00:24:58.400
new red blood cells and things like that.
What does his scientific background?

464
00:24:58.850 --> 00:25:03.470
So I don't know all of that.
I know he worked for NASA.
Um,
he was,
um,

465
00:25:03.620 --> 00:25:08.150
like working with the nuclear anti [inaudible] defense system and then he missed

466
00:25:08.151 --> 00:25:10.860
a Christmas or something and decided to,
uh,

467
00:25:10.970 --> 00:25:14.920
move home and be a school teacher and you became a calculus teacher.
Whoa.
Um,

468
00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:18.170
and he has like a private high school and uh,

469
00:25:18.230 --> 00:25:20.810
people would travel over the world to do,
is clap to take his class.

470
00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:24.140
He wants him a war to be in the best calculus teacher in the world.

471
00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:26.900
Like all of his kids on his placement test score.

472
00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:31.100
I don't know if it's perfect or very high.
And it was so,
yeah,
he's,

473
00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:35.660
he's just a like,
math,
math will tell you everything that you,
and the numbers,

474
00:25:35.661 --> 00:25:38.840
it's not,
like I said,
it's not bro Science.
It's to the exact,
you know,

475
00:25:38.841 --> 00:25:41.780
exactly for getting better.
Um,
yeah.

476
00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:47.030
Well he must apply that science to his understanding of,
of energy and of,

477
00:25:47.031 --> 00:25:50.750
of intensity because like the way you guys train,
it's very intense,

478
00:25:50.751 --> 00:25:51.800
very explosive.

479
00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:55.820
It reminds me a lot of what I'm seeing at least have like Marvin Marinovich his

480
00:25:55.821 --> 00:26:00.140
type training,
like a lot of plyometrics,
a lot of things along those lines.

481
00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:05.190
Would that be fair to say?
Absolutely.
But then we also do,
we're also doing,
um,

482
00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:08.540
a dead lifts and cleans and we're doing a lot of stuff,
man.
Um,

483
00:26:09.050 --> 00:26:11.990
and he mixes it up a lot.
Yeah.
Depending where you're at in your camp,
um,

484
00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:16.100
how your body also the recovery.
So the recovery is huge.
He listens to our,
our,

485
00:26:16.101 --> 00:26:17.720
uh,
our body while we're sleeping.

486
00:26:17.721 --> 00:26:20.750
So he gets a report every morning of how is next to you in the bed?

487
00:26:20.950 --> 00:26:24.270
Pretty much like if you had a couple of glasses of wine,
you know,

488
00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:27.110
like why you're not recovering.
He just like knows our,

489
00:26:27.111 --> 00:26:28.370
if you notice you're too stressed out.
He knows.

490
00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:30.050
Like he'll tell me when I'm going to get sick.

491
00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:33.440
Like he's caught onto me getting sick before I got sick.
It was like,
oh,

492
00:26:33.441 --> 00:26:36.200
your body's about to crash.
Like you need to like take the next day,

493
00:26:36.201 --> 00:26:39.210
next two days off,
like really rest.
I mean,

494
00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:43.500
he helped keep TJ in that last fight.
Help repair some injuries.
Right.

495
00:26:43.501 --> 00:26:44.010
We have to talk

496
00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:48.600
<v 4>about him,
but he,
he keep it without Sam.
Yeah.
That fight may have been different.</v>

497
00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:50.910
Probably my last two fights.
Yeah.
Yeah,
you're right.
Yes sir.

498
00:26:50.911 --> 00:26:52.140
I'm in dealing with some serious stuff,

499
00:26:52.150 --> 00:26:56.020
<v 2>the last couple of fights,
but I've been able to keep my body very,
very strong.</v>

500
00:26:56.780 --> 00:27:01.090
You also spend some time with doctor Neil Riordan down in Panama and did that,

501
00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:03.750
was that for the same type of injury?
Same thing.
Yeah.
Yeah.

502
00:27:03.820 --> 00:27:08.260
So a combination combination of the science of stem cell and Dr. Neal Roden as

503
00:27:08.261 --> 00:27:10.690
well as Maura here.
I got,
I mean,
I got stem cells in the states.

504
00:27:10.691 --> 00:27:11.530
I got an in Panama,

505
00:27:11.531 --> 00:27:14.620
like I've had to do a lot to hold myself together kind of thing,
you know,

506
00:27:14.621 --> 00:27:19.270
and I feel great.
Um,
because of the way I'm training and,
and uh,
yeah,

507
00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:21.340
I don't think people understand the,

508
00:27:21.450 --> 00:27:25.840
the kind of strain on your body of fight camp puts.

509
00:27:25.930 --> 00:27:30.010
It's fucking crazy mean.
If I worked out the way you guys did once,

510
00:27:30.310 --> 00:27:34.300
I'm wreck for a week,
but that's what I was doing two a days every day.

511
00:27:34.450 --> 00:27:37.210
Constantly going at it.
And then there's ice baths.
Is Sam,

512
00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:41.650
what does he have you doing?
Sauna,
ice bath was you,
have you got,
um,

513
00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:44.290
for our recovery,
I mean mainly it's just a lot of,

514
00:27:44.291 --> 00:27:49.240
most of I'm taking the time off,
but we have,
um,
it's always changing.

515
00:27:49.241 --> 00:27:51.550
It's always evolving too.
He's got like this,
I'm all pro,

516
00:27:51.551 --> 00:27:54.430
we do for like some sort of stem on her muscles where I do light.

517
00:27:54.431 --> 00:27:59.050
They're like electrical stim.
I do,
I do a light therapy.
Um,

518
00:27:59.170 --> 00:28:01.500
there's this new place he's starting to work with,
uh,

519
00:28:01.570 --> 00:28:05.830
down in mission Viejo called like Otu recovery center where we'll do,

520
00:28:06.190 --> 00:28:09.460
we'll do Cryo,
we'll do hyperbaric chamber,
we'll do,
um,

521
00:28:09.670 --> 00:28:11.290
was it [inaudible] vac or something like that.

522
00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:15.010
A bunch of different stuff we're going to add to is a machine we were talking

523
00:28:15.011 --> 00:28:18.760
about really recently where it jacks you up in all in altitude and that brings

524
00:28:18.761 --> 00:28:22.180
you down and like changes the pressure inside that little tube and that's

525
00:28:22.181 --> 00:28:24.430
supposed to be pretty amazing.
Did you have good results with that?

526
00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:25.480
I actually haven't done it yet.

527
00:28:25.481 --> 00:28:28.120
So then he's telling me now that like we're going to add this now.

528
00:28:28.150 --> 00:28:31.210
Like it's always like every time I come back to camp it's like we're adding in

529
00:28:31.211 --> 00:28:31.870
the next step.

530
00:28:31.870 --> 00:28:36.040
<v 4>He doesn't do it all at once as it should always changing the evolvement at the</v>

531
00:28:36.041 --> 00:28:36.701
time.
He'd be like,

532
00:28:36.701 --> 00:28:41.350
you teaching me the BMT black belt system right away without knowing any of it,

533
00:28:41.410 --> 00:28:43.150
you know?
So he like gets my body

534
00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:47.700
<v 2>slowly adapted to certain things,
then he adds to it.
What about massage?
Yeah.</v>

535
00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:49.730
Yeah.
What kind of massage?
He doesn't have me do it.

536
00:28:49.790 --> 00:28:52.450
I just do it because I love it,
you know?
But,
uh,
I,

537
00:28:52.780 --> 00:28:56.510
I always do deep tissue for the most part.
And then I'm a lot of that like Matt,

538
00:28:56.511 --> 00:29:00.740
like the stretching.
Um,
kind of like a Thai massage type stuff.

539
00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:04.260
A lot of time massage and then the also,
yeah,
exactly.
I forgot.
They'd stretch.

540
00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:05.990
Amazing.
Standing your back and

541
00:29:06.670 --> 00:29:09.580
<v 4>your arms up.
You're like,
I have a student,
Thomas see me.</v>

542
00:29:09.610 --> 00:29:13.460
He is by far the best massage therapist I've ever come across.
He's really,

543
00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:16.810
he's bad ass.
There's ones out there,
man.
He,
he,
he's,

544
00:29:16.990 --> 00:29:20.950
he's got a black belt in massage therapy,
that's for sure.
Like a,
a good massage.

545
00:29:20.951 --> 00:29:21.470
Shouldn't

546
00:29:21.470 --> 00:29:24.050
<v 2>feel that great to the average person.
Like it's going to hurt to hurt.</v>

547
00:29:24.530 --> 00:29:25.730
It's how you're going to feel afterwards.

548
00:29:25.731 --> 00:29:29.630
And I actually now I've learned to enjoy the pain kind of thing.
Well yeah,

549
00:29:29.631 --> 00:29:30.740
actually.
So I'm an,

550
00:29:30.810 --> 00:29:34.070
I've been working this whole last camp to a guy that really helped me get to my

551
00:29:34.071 --> 00:29:38.980
camp was um,
how many do it right now?
Drawing a blank.
But uh,

552
00:29:39.050 --> 00:29:42.320
Javier,
he uh,
did a lot of work on me.
Um,

553
00:29:42.710 --> 00:29:46.810
<v 3>hold me in place as well to body bodywork as opposed to like,
what's like,</v>

554
00:29:46.860 --> 00:29:49.770
what does body work as opposed to regular massage?
So He's more of like,
um,

555
00:29:49.930 --> 00:29:53.080
the nerve,
like the nervous system of all your,
your pathways.
Um,

556
00:29:53.081 --> 00:29:54.740
and really find out what's weak.
I can't,

557
00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:58.090
he'll tell me like something that's like week before I even let him know before

558
00:29:58.091 --> 00:30:01.900
the massage.
Can they,
how can tell that?
I don't know how I can tell that.

559
00:30:01.901 --> 00:30:03.910
I'm not really sure.
I'd have to have him tell you.

560
00:30:04.330 --> 00:30:07.750
There's something weird about people that touch people's bodies all the time and

561
00:30:07.751 --> 00:30:10.000
you go,
this is all horse shit.
And then they put their arm or shoulder,

562
00:30:10.001 --> 00:30:12.790
what's going on with your shoulder?
You're like,
what do you mean?
And like,

563
00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:15.940
it's very a very tense up here.
You have an injury,
you nursing like,

564
00:30:16.210 --> 00:30:19.730
well how'd you know six sentence?
For sure.
It's,

565
00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:23.500
they just get used to like the difference between your left side and your right

566
00:30:23.501 --> 00:30:27.100
side.
I like,
oh,
something's going on here.
They just,
it's like everything else,

567
00:30:27.101 --> 00:30:27.281
right?

568
00:30:27.281 --> 00:30:30.430
Like your understanding of what an athlete's is capable of is so different than

569
00:30:30.431 --> 00:30:34.570
a person who doesn't train just,
and I think it's gotta be,
you know,
we don't,

570
00:30:34.630 --> 00:30:37.420
we can't imagine someone would be able to touch your pack and go,
Oh,

571
00:30:37.421 --> 00:30:40.000
you've got a tear.
You got them,
you got a muscle tear.
You're like,
what?

572
00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:43.300
But there's also this massage therapist,
they'll do something like,
how's it feel?

573
00:30:43.301 --> 00:30:45.450
You feel better?
It's like,
Oh yeah,
I guess I feel better now,

574
00:30:45.490 --> 00:30:50.230
but this guy will find my weaknesses without me even telling him he'll know like

575
00:30:50.231 --> 00:30:52.920
things that I need to get worked on.
Uh,
he knows my hips are lined up,

576
00:30:52.990 --> 00:30:55.210
like kind of like almost like a chiropractor as well,

577
00:30:55.211 --> 00:30:59.210
but he doesn't do chiropractic work.
Good.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.

578
00:30:59.710 --> 00:31:02.980
Would it be like how practice?
I just don't think it's real.
I love him.

579
00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:05.320
I love to get lined back up.
Good.
I've had neck,

580
00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:08.050
my neck just tweaked and not be able to do anything and then get lined back up

581
00:31:08.051 --> 00:31:12.670
and be ready to go.
It's definitely how size I think works better than anything.

582
00:31:13.220 --> 00:31:17.800
But it just too much about what,
what chiropractic medicine was,
how it started.

583
00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:21.850
It started by a guy who was a magnetic healer who learned about it in a seance

584
00:31:21.851 --> 00:31:24.340
and then his son murdered him and took over the business,

585
00:31:25.070 --> 00:31:28.210
turned out to be something good but they didn't.
People are crazy.
Yes.

586
00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:31.780
The good thing about it,
I mean it's interesting what's good and what's not.

587
00:31:31.810 --> 00:31:36.540
You know what's provable is,
it's very interesting.
What's,
they just,
they,

588
00:31:36.541 --> 00:31:36.940
they,

589
00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:41.680
people always say that it's a part of the National Institute of health care.

590
00:31:41.770 --> 00:31:45.670
Is that what it is?
Uh,
a part of their recommended program,
but it's not anymore.

591
00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:47.620
They were,
they removed it.
There's not,

592
00:31:47.621 --> 00:31:51.210
there's no real evidence that shows it works.
The thing about it is though,

593
00:31:51.220 --> 00:31:54.820
it's like I just adjusted myself.
Like I adjusted my knuckles.

594
00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:57.130
That's literally what they're doing,
what they're doing to your back.

595
00:31:57.160 --> 00:31:58.840
I've had for whatever of it,
you know,

596
00:31:58.841 --> 00:32:02.020
over a hundred fights and whenever and how my neck jacked up wrestling and shots

597
00:32:02.021 --> 00:32:06.010
and I've had pretty significant injury where I couldn't like change lanes and

598
00:32:06.011 --> 00:32:07.690
turn and drive and then go get adjusted.

599
00:32:07.691 --> 00:32:12.190
And be back to square one I think has done the same thing with massage.

600
00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:15.940
I think there's something to people touching you and working on stuff and Lou

601
00:32:15.950 --> 00:32:18.250
and loosening you up in a way that you can't do.

602
00:32:18.610 --> 00:32:21.970
And I'm not saying that there's not good chiropractors out there that really

603
00:32:21.971 --> 00:32:25.990
understand all the other things like cold laser therapy and different kinds of

604
00:32:25.991 --> 00:32:30.400
manipulation in terms of like,
you know,
muscle stretching and um,
um,

605
00:32:30.460 --> 00:32:33.440
what does that type of a rolfing,
rolfing is legit.

606
00:32:33.950 --> 00:32:38.650
It's that massage,
just a brutal,
brutal massage.

607
00:32:38.651 --> 00:32:42.290
But it's one of those things where it breaks everything down and then after it's

608
00:32:42.291 --> 00:32:44.510
over,
everything's very loose.
Okay.
And there's,

609
00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:47.150
there's a lot of chiropractors that are really good physical therapist too,

610
00:32:47.270 --> 00:32:48.100
but just the,

611
00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:53.100
the underlying principles of what the chiropractic medical practice is,

612
00:32:55.010 --> 00:32:56.540
it started off with nonsense.

613
00:32:56.840 --> 00:32:59.870
The guy thought he could fix everything by adjusting you.
Oh,

614
00:32:59.871 --> 00:33:03.320
for some reason your eyesight let me fix it.
Got past the limits.
We fix it.

615
00:33:03.450 --> 00:33:05.660
I'm gonna crack your neck and you're not going to have bad breath anymore,

616
00:33:05.740 --> 00:33:09.860
like stupid.
But if he tells you to believe that people are like,
oh,
nice power,

617
00:33:09.861 --> 00:33:10.700
belief to serious.
Yeah,

618
00:33:10.850 --> 00:33:14.030
that's part of the problem is that it's one of the things they prey on.

619
00:33:14.031 --> 00:33:16.980
One of the things that they use is an not necessarily theirs.

620
00:33:17.030 --> 00:33:19.370
There's levels to this whole,
you know thing.

621
00:33:19.370 --> 00:33:22.280
It's not just regular chiropractor sessions.
There's,
you know,

622
00:33:22.281 --> 00:33:26.870
there's different kinds of air quote healers that have like different systems.

623
00:33:26.871 --> 00:33:29.990
If they think they can push down the middle of your back and cure your pancreas.

624
00:33:30.380 --> 00:33:33.900
So much horseshit,
but it's not real.
You know what the,

625
00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:38.180
but there are a bunch of things you can do that are real and massage is one of

626
00:33:38.181 --> 00:33:39.840
them.
Massage is this.

627
00:33:39.860 --> 00:33:44.860
It's absolutely a fact that it's helped loosen people up and relax people and

628
00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:47.600
just something about being manipulated like that.

629
00:33:47.601 --> 00:33:51.180
Like if somebody really digging their elbow into your tissue and loosen it and

630
00:33:51.181 --> 00:33:54.530
everything up.
We got this fucking Tim Tam.
You ever used one of these?

631
00:33:54.590 --> 00:33:58.220
<v 4>Yeah,
I have a,
I have a Tim Tam and I have a third gun.</v>

632
00:33:58.221 --> 00:34:03.020
His work to this is the mother.
Yeah.
Okay,
cool.
Yeah,

633
00:34:03.750 --> 00:34:08.720
I think I have that thing is the shit that thing's amazing.
Oh yeah.

634
00:34:08.740 --> 00:34:09.800
Frost.
A hobby in the house.

635
00:34:11.350 --> 00:34:13.610
<v 3>Anything that's like knotted up and really bother.</v>

636
00:34:13.611 --> 00:34:16.090
You get hammered with that fucking thing.
And then afterwards it's like,

637
00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:19.470
<v 4>what am I?
Students made one of those that have a little a drill or a</v>

638
00:34:21.390 --> 00:34:23.940
tennis ball or something on it.
Like wow,
this is,

639
00:34:24.030 --> 00:34:28.950
I mean it's just the same kind of motive.
It's going to make this thing for $30

640
00:34:30.820 --> 00:34:35.580
fuck a playground.
So when you guys are doing camp,

641
00:34:35.581 --> 00:34:38.820
do you move down to California for the what you do six or eight weeks?

642
00:34:38.821 --> 00:34:42.300
How many weeks are you doing?
I do a lot.

643
00:34:42.420 --> 00:34:43.590
I've got to do more than I probably should,

644
00:34:43.591 --> 00:34:46.590
but I mean I'd almost do can't before I get into camp kind of thing.

645
00:34:46.860 --> 00:34:49.620
I like to get yourself in shape.
Yeah,
I like to be in shape when camp starts,

646
00:34:49.621 --> 00:34:52.920
you know,
it's always developing new things.
This camp,
Dwayne came out,

647
00:34:52.950 --> 00:34:56.650
like started coming out in nine weeks before the fight.
Maybe 10 my pain,

648
00:34:56.780 --> 00:35:00.510
it was a lecture more than two months and he would do a three days.

649
00:35:00.510 --> 00:35:05.220
He'd come out flout Monday,
Wednesday,
Friday or no,
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Uh,
Monday,

650
00:35:05.220 --> 00:35:07.050
Tuesday,
Wednesday.
So I'll be out here three days back home,
four days.

651
00:35:07.530 --> 00:35:11.520
Splitting time.
But it worked at y.
With that I was able to find a,

652
00:35:11.521 --> 00:35:14.570
which I was already aware of.
I slowed down.
What the fuck?
Sorry.

653
00:35:14.571 --> 00:35:18.860
I get excited when I got my note pad right here folks.

654
00:35:18.861 --> 00:35:22.160
I want tell you I'm sorry I got to talk slower today.
We'll talk slower.

655
00:35:22.180 --> 00:35:24.450
People was complain.
I talk too fast.
I'm going to talk slower.

656
00:35:24.660 --> 00:35:27.090
But you get a lot of information in and that one minute in the corner.

657
00:35:27.910 --> 00:35:30.290
That's what I talked about cause that's why I talk fast.
Yeah.

658
00:35:30.570 --> 00:35:32.190
This is why I'm wired.
Why I talk fast.

659
00:35:32.310 --> 00:35:34.770
I got about 30 seconds to talk and really information,

660
00:35:34.771 --> 00:35:38.180
which is also why I have the actual system and all the,
the,

661
00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:41.280
the draws a combination so I can condense it.
Right.
I don't want to say jab,

662
00:35:41.281 --> 00:35:41.611
cross,
Hook,

663
00:35:41.611 --> 00:35:45.570
cross three and that came from box right in the corner for my IC tomorrow fight,

664
00:35:45.571 --> 00:35:48.460
tell me what to do.
And I walk out there in 30 seconds later I'd knock them out,

665
00:35:48.610 --> 00:35:49.441
whatever it is.
You know,

666
00:35:49.441 --> 00:35:52.770
like you guys able to get the information off and there's a system to it laying

667
00:35:52.771 --> 00:35:56.960
out and mapping.
There's routines and there's patterns of success,
you know,
uh,

668
00:35:57.180 --> 00:35:59.700
there are higher percentage drills and combinations that have been proven to be

669
00:35:59.701 --> 00:36:02.310
successful.
Well how about we just keep practicing those,

670
00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:04.200
but obviously it's up to the athlete to find the time,

671
00:36:04.201 --> 00:36:06.410
the distance and accuracy to pull them off.
But they're,

672
00:36:06.530 --> 00:36:08.090
they aren't part of the billing information.

673
00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:10.680
We have to believe in the system too.
I can't be like,

674
00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.740
like if I didn't believe exactly what Dwayne was telling me or that he can see

675
00:36:13.741 --> 00:36:15.690
it,
that I know he can see it cause he's good at it.

676
00:36:15.970 --> 00:36:18.810
Like are why are you really going to go out there and do what he says?

677
00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:21.780
That's one thing I had with boss too.
Whenever he gave me information.

678
00:36:21.990 --> 00:36:25.050
I did not doubt it at all as I know he's been there and done that and it wasn't

679
00:36:25.051 --> 00:36:28.830
stuff that he felt he would do his stuff that he knew that I should do.
Right.

680
00:36:28.850 --> 00:36:31.770
And I feel like understand Tj and I could give him the proper information for

681
00:36:31.771 --> 00:36:34.950
the proper time,
but also I know when to sit back and let them flow as well.

682
00:36:34.951 --> 00:36:35.980
Right.
And,
and when,
uh,

683
00:36:36.150 --> 00:36:39.330
when to chip in and give them information and he's really good about,
you know,

684
00:36:39.390 --> 00:36:41.460
receiving information as a case in point.

685
00:36:41.610 --> 00:36:43.110
The first fight with Cody between the rounds,

686
00:36:43.111 --> 00:36:46.140
we have drastically changed things and what we needed to change with just the

687
00:36:46.141 --> 00:36:50.310
timing of our attack.
It's pretty simple to me.

688
00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:54.720
Fighting is now I,
I don't,
I don't think I know it all.
I mean,
I know,

689
00:36:54.721 --> 00:36:58.900
I don't know it all,
but it's all I know and I know a lot,
that's for sure.
But,
uh,

690
00:36:58.901 --> 00:37:02.160
I was going back to earlier traveling out here three days a week and back home

691
00:37:02.161 --> 00:37:05.280
four days again,
I found a really good fuck.

692
00:37:05.281 --> 00:37:06.890
Slow Down with what you've done great for.

693
00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:11.900
One was I found a good rhythm of us as far as pulling off information as far as

694
00:37:14.821 --> 00:37:18.510
the path,
the class sparring and this was like we're layering it up,

695
00:37:18.511 --> 00:37:19.980
we're practicing it in class,

696
00:37:20.100 --> 00:37:22.680
now we're sparring with it and then going back to what we need to work on.

697
00:37:22.681 --> 00:37:26.880
So I found a really good pyramid too for Tj to retain or for anyone to retain

698
00:37:26.881 --> 00:37:30.030
the information.
It kind of condensing it to three days.
It's,
it was,

699
00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:33.210
it was really fun.
It was,
I look at it as a,
as an experiment.

700
00:37:33.211 --> 00:37:37.650
What's the most optimal way for someone to perform in fight safe and effectively

701
00:37:38.580 --> 00:37:39.960
it's fun.
I love this shit.

702
00:37:39.990 --> 00:37:43.350
There's a lot of people that want to go to these big giant super camps and I

703
00:37:43.351 --> 00:37:43.621
know,

704
00:37:43.621 --> 00:37:48.090
you know with Alpha male you were in a big giant super camp you're doing now is

705
00:37:48.091 --> 00:37:49.230
very different and that's,

706
00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:53.400
this is something that obviously steeped Emile Church was doing.

707
00:37:53.490 --> 00:37:58.050
There's a lot of other funders that we're doing that are doing where a lot of it

708
00:37:58.051 --> 00:38:01.140
is based around them.
Mighty mouse in particular.
That's,
so he's another one.

709
00:38:01.170 --> 00:38:04.560
I mean there are a an unquestionably professional fighters around them,

710
00:38:04.830 --> 00:38:08.580
but it's not like they're in a building with six other world champions and is a

711
00:38:08.581 --> 00:38:12.840
bunch of savages that are coming up that you know and everybody's trying to kill

712
00:38:12.841 --> 00:38:16.560
each other.
It's a,
it's a different,
it's a different set up.
Like it's,

713
00:38:16.561 --> 00:38:18.180
a lot of it is geared towards you.

714
00:38:18.460 --> 00:38:22.380
It is and it's just the national way it kind of have happened this time cause

715
00:38:22.381 --> 00:38:23.580
this better.
What is better?

716
00:38:23.610 --> 00:38:27.360
Is it better to be in the dog house with all the Alpha male guys where it's all

717
00:38:27.361 --> 00:38:31.740
just animals trying to kill each other while yes,
for quantity,
yes.
If it's,

718
00:38:31.770 --> 00:38:34.590
if it's not for money,
you know what I mean?

719
00:38:34.591 --> 00:38:36.040
When these big gyms turned into something that wants

720
00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:38.650
<v 2>to make money,
then the real martial arts comes out of it.</v>

721
00:38:38.890 --> 00:38:43.330
When you have coaches and people running it that are really going to not want
to,

722
00:38:43.331 --> 00:38:44.800
like I have a gym,
the training lab.

723
00:38:44.801 --> 00:38:48.510
So I'm very fortunate that I have Steve Martin,
I guys will spin,

724
00:38:48.910 --> 00:38:51.250
he's put his heart and soul into this thing to keep this building open because

725
00:38:51.251 --> 00:38:54.190
we're not making money.
We're not,
we're not,
we're not gonna help.
We don't have a,

726
00:38:54.220 --> 00:38:57.670
it's pretty much private teach a kid's class and we do adult boot,

727
00:38:57.730 --> 00:39:01.210
a boot camp kind of things just to turn the lights on just so the bills are
paid.

728
00:39:01.510 --> 00:39:03.550
And then some sponsors here and there to pay the coaches.

729
00:39:03.790 --> 00:39:07.000
Like we're losing money and,
and thank God that we have a guy like Steve Martin.

730
00:39:07.001 --> 00:39:10.600
It's willing to see our dream that we want to build a team that is not based

731
00:39:10.601 --> 00:39:12.490
around money,
that it's uh,
um,

732
00:39:13.210 --> 00:39:16.030
whatever money we didn't make it from the gym is going every dollar to the

733
00:39:16.031 --> 00:39:19.090
coaches,
you know,
like I don't want them to,
I don't want to make money.

734
00:39:19.090 --> 00:39:20.890
I don't want that awkward relationship between me.

735
00:39:20.891 --> 00:39:23.970
And why aren't you letter that I'm making money off him?
You know what it mean,

736
00:39:24.010 --> 00:39:27.550
then you get that weird business relationship rather than us just having a real

737
00:39:27.551 --> 00:39:30.250
relationship.
Like me wanting him to get better,
him wanting me to get better,

738
00:39:30.580 --> 00:39:34.240
which I felt like maybe you used to kind of be that way.
Alpha male,

739
00:39:34.241 --> 00:39:38.110
but it's turned into a money thing to wear it.
I Dunno man.

740
00:39:38.111 --> 00:39:41.710
It wasn't like there wasn't like before we,
before we got Duane,
we had no coach.

741
00:39:41.711 --> 00:39:44.080
It was just us coaching each other kind of thing.
You know?

742
00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:47.530
That's not usually the best thing.
No,
we were just beating each other.

743
00:39:47.531 --> 00:39:50.500
We were sparring four or five days a week.
Yeah,
dude do.

744
00:39:50.501 --> 00:39:53.020
I mean I picked up stuff fast because of it,
you know,

745
00:39:53.021 --> 00:39:56.710
like you had to learn how to fight and I'm aggressive and I liked that stuff.

746
00:39:56.740 --> 00:40:00.670
But it's not smart,
you know,
in terms of like your overall health,

747
00:40:00.671 --> 00:40:05.650
their longevity in the sport,
you know?
Um,
yeah.
So I,

748
00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:09.850
I,
I've control,
I've turned into a real professional athlete's sport.

749
00:40:09.851 --> 00:40:12.090
Instead of it just go into the gym and going Ham.

750
00:40:12.100 --> 00:40:13.780
Like I can go everywhere from my diet,

751
00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:18.370
everywhere from the way I work at the Times.
I work out my schedule,
my recovery,

752
00:40:18.580 --> 00:40:23.020
um,
have,
luckily I'm having Duane is able to travel out with me.
Um,

753
00:40:23.710 --> 00:40:26.740
I built a,
I built an awesome facility right now with Mark Munoz,

754
00:40:26.770 --> 00:40:30.340
circling back around being a coach,
Joe Christian fleet today,

755
00:40:30.341 --> 00:40:33.550
Monica and all these guys,
like it's not money driven so it's,

756
00:40:33.670 --> 00:40:37.660
it's doing great right now.
We're,
we're,
we're awesome.
We're doing awesome.

757
00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:40.800
<v 3>Yeah,
he really does have a really good crew of people around him in,</v>

758
00:40:40.820 --> 00:40:45.460
in all citizen Yorba Linda.
We're in Anaheim and all beautiful.
Yeah,

759
00:40:45.730 --> 00:40:49.570
that's great.
So when the UFC is in Anaheim,
you're a hop,
skip and a jump away.

760
00:40:49.660 --> 00:40:52.670
Oh yeah,
we're right there.
I mean even finding an la was nice.
I mean,
you know,

761
00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:56.320
tend to fly,
knew where it was cool to find your backyard.
Dan Lambert did,

762
00:40:56.380 --> 00:40:57.790
did all this before anybody.

763
00:40:57.940 --> 00:41:01.510
I mean Dan Lambert in terms of like throwing money at things and putting

764
00:41:01.511 --> 00:41:04.530
American top team.
I mean,
that guy,
he,

765
00:41:04.580 --> 00:41:06.910
he spent a fuck load of money,

766
00:41:07.300 --> 00:41:12.300
put fighters on salary and then recently built a giant place with dormitories

767
00:41:12.521 --> 00:41:16.120
and everything.
You know,
that guy at all of the people that he's,
uh,

768
00:41:16.450 --> 00:41:20.380
probably the pioneer of digging deep into his wallet and putting together a

769
00:41:20.381 --> 00:41:25.150
crazy gym set up like that different kinds of crew,
you know,

770
00:41:25.151 --> 00:41:28.210
you go down there,
then there are a ton of world champions.

771
00:41:28.210 --> 00:41:30.960
There's a ton of professional athletes and you know,
it's,

772
00:41:30.970 --> 00:41:34.580
you're not necessarily going to get the singular specified training that you're

773
00:41:34.581 --> 00:41:37.970
getting right now.
Yeah,
for sure.
And then,
but we're also really,
so yeah,

774
00:41:38.090 --> 00:41:39.990
you can be really good and we want you in our gym,

775
00:41:39.991 --> 00:41:41.640
but if you have the right personality as well too,

776
00:41:41.660 --> 00:41:44.600
it's not only about your skill to become a train with their gym and be a pro

777
00:41:44.601 --> 00:41:48.470
athlete there.
We also got a vibe with us.
If we don't have the vibe,

778
00:41:48.471 --> 00:41:51.440
then it's all egos are going to get involved and the gym's going to split up.

779
00:41:51.441 --> 00:41:53.120
This guy's going to go here,
this guy's going to go there.

780
00:41:53.121 --> 00:41:54.410
So how do you determine that?

781
00:41:54.411 --> 00:41:56.510
Do you get to know them first and then let them in the jail?

782
00:41:56.511 --> 00:41:59.180
We always let everyone in to see how they're going.
If they don't work out,

783
00:41:59.181 --> 00:42:02.030
then we tell him like,
hey man,
this isn't the spot for you.
We don't,

784
00:42:02.031 --> 00:42:02.864
we don't have an open spot.

785
00:42:03.070 --> 00:42:06.610
<v 1>You can see it with the drills and the Dutch Bros and just the drilling in</v>

786
00:42:06.611 --> 00:42:10.930
general how caring and somebody is.
Right and right.
There's,
there's four rules.

787
00:42:10.931 --> 00:42:14.380
Ask My guys to follow.
And there are rules that revolve around accountability.

788
00:42:14.381 --> 00:42:18.430
It's a show up on time.
Get better,
get tired,
take care of your partner.

789
00:42:18.700 --> 00:42:21.640
You do those four simple things and we're good.
It's pretty simple.

790
00:42:21.690 --> 00:42:24.680
<v 3>Hmm.
Those are very good rules.
Yeah.
It's,
it's,</v>

791
00:42:25.310 --> 00:42:29.330
it's a sport that attracts people who are troubled.
Yeah.
Agreed.
Yeah.

792
00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:33.410
The rounds of the misfits.
Yeah.
And then it's happened that have been abused.

793
00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:36.140
They want to get people back.
You know,
there's a lot of that.

794
00:42:36.170 --> 00:42:39.290
You remember a lot of when,
when I was younger,

795
00:42:39.291 --> 00:42:43.040
the more aggressive mean are people.
When you would find out more about them,

796
00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:47.390
he'd find out there was child abuse.
Dad used to beat him up.
Stepdad beat him up.

797
00:42:47.690 --> 00:42:50.630
There was always something that they were trying to get back at people for.

798
00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:54.890
I feel like this sport is changing enough now that it's a very common thing that

799
00:42:55.010 --> 00:42:57.560
kids want to do.
It's now you have,
you know,

800
00:42:58.100 --> 00:43:00.620
kids with the good breath brings wanting to do it.
Yeah.

801
00:43:00.650 --> 00:43:05.330
It's a challenging possible career now.
And a in a fighter,
you know,

802
00:43:05.331 --> 00:43:08.080
a young kid coming up see someone like you and they go,
oh,

803
00:43:08.081 --> 00:43:12.520
can you look at this guy?
He's two time world champion.
Super respectful,

804
00:43:12.620 --> 00:43:16.880
articulate,
real friendly,
doesn't have a chip on his shoulder,
likes,
you know,

805
00:43:16.881 --> 00:43:19.220
shaking hands and taking pictures and being around people.

806
00:43:19.250 --> 00:43:20.870
Oh you don't have to be an asshole.

807
00:43:21.390 --> 00:43:25.040
Like you don't have to be some brooding asshole for sure.
Yeah.

808
00:43:25.270 --> 00:43:29.090
I mean you'll get paid for it in one of these days,
but yeah.
That's interesting,

809
00:43:29.091 --> 00:43:32.150
right?
If you get paid more for being a complete asshole,
you know,
and make,

810
00:43:32.151 --> 00:43:35.660
if you don't mind making a fool of yourself,
then you get paid more.
You know,

811
00:43:36.050 --> 00:43:39.860
like Colby.
Yeah.
Yeah.
To the extreme.
To what?
Like what?
Come on Colby.

812
00:43:39.861 --> 00:43:41.680
So hilarious.
I don't know.
I think it's funny,
man,

813
00:43:41.681 --> 00:43:45.620
when I actually went to the fucking White House and put the thing on Donald

814
00:43:45.620 --> 00:43:49.130
Trump's desk getting the belt,
I was like,
that is hilarious.
He actually did it.

815
00:43:49.160 --> 00:43:51.620
Yeah.
You know,
it really,
really be funny.
If it turned out,

816
00:43:51.621 --> 00:43:54.890
was this whole time he was a Democrat and this is all just a big act.

817
00:43:54.891 --> 00:43:59.891
It's really super pro gay rights and put a bit of a women's team in the office.

818
00:44:00.711 --> 00:44:03.860
He'd be a Democrat and then whoever's in the office as well.

819
00:44:03.861 --> 00:44:08.060
He's just doing it only specifically just for promotion.
Yeah.

820
00:44:08.210 --> 00:44:12.770
Him and Tyron Woodley's going to be co Raisie.
That's going to be crazy.

821
00:44:13.220 --> 00:44:15.170
<v 1>So you get no,
the videos on the Internet,</v>

822
00:44:15.171 --> 00:44:18.860
the one a black dude that says I'm Tyrone and fuck this or fuck that,
whatever.

823
00:44:18.861 --> 00:44:21.260
You know,
you know the Internet guy.
Oh,
they're hilarious.

824
00:44:21.261 --> 00:44:23.840
Can you pull up one of those videos of tie around this?
So funny,

825
00:44:24.050 --> 00:44:26.570
but would you two would've been funny.
I'm sorry.

826
00:44:26.571 --> 00:44:28.450
You got to explain what you fuck.
You're talking about so

827
00:44:33.090 --> 00:44:37.920
<v 4>hilarious.
Right?
Watch it.
He'll pull it up.
But uh,
it would've been a no,
no.</v>

828
00:44:38.070 --> 00:44:41.780
Do you know what I'm talking about Jamie?
You do.
Goodness.
Okay.

829
00:44:42.470 --> 00:44:47.120
So watch this first.
Watch one of these,
give me some,
I'll give you sip.
Hold on.

830
00:44:47.260 --> 00:44:51.090
Go bring him from the beginning.
This is a long compilation of it.

831
00:44:51.410 --> 00:44:53.640
He just like kind of walks around and bullies people sorta

832
00:44:56.100 --> 00:44:59.580
kind of a joke.
Is that,
is that him though?
That's not the regular tyrona

833
00:45:01.110 --> 00:45:03.490
this is another one is a different guy.
Yeah.

834
00:45:03.491 --> 00:45:05.910
This is a different one than the other ones that he's a different guy.

835
00:45:08.530 --> 00:45:12.030
He'll do,
he'll go,
I mean you just type in Tyrone black dude in the Internet.

836
00:45:12.031 --> 00:45:13.020
I mean you're going to get a lot of it.

837
00:45:14.260 --> 00:45:17.610
So it would have been funny cause if that's not the best clip,
uh,

838
00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:20.250
cause if he would have won the belt,
but no,
he wanted the boat rides.

839
00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:22.380
I'm Tyrone and this is my motherfucking bill.

840
00:45:22.530 --> 00:45:26.490
So if you watch these videos and actual good video of the Tyrone and Tyrone

841
00:45:26.491 --> 00:45:28.150
would do that and the cage.
I was,
I was,

842
00:45:28.410 --> 00:45:30.780
I've been thinking about this for a while and I shouldn't have been so fucking

843
00:45:30.781 --> 00:45:34.740
funny,
but it's not funny.
He's one of the damn videos.
Shit,
Jamie,
pull that up.

844
00:45:37.170 --> 00:45:38.550
I watched the Rogan show.

845
00:45:38.900 --> 00:45:43.140
That was the guy who I think I'm gonna Steal your line was that's hilarious.

846
00:45:43.600 --> 00:45:48.440
Yeah.
To,
he was almost after he won.
Like,
like nothing happened.
He just,

847
00:45:48.540 --> 00:45:52.970
he knew it.
Right.
It's just weird.
You know this is another one.
That's him.

848
00:45:53.250 --> 00:45:57.500
Is it the same guy?
Yeah.
This is one where he gets beat up for saying,
Oh really?

849
00:45:58.340 --> 00:46:02.900
Oh,
here it is.
Look in Mama.
Fuck,
fuck.
Yo,

850
00:46:04.570 --> 00:46:08.890
what's up?
What's up?
We'll make them all up.
Let's do something

851
00:46:12.660 --> 00:46:17.410
comes out wrong.
Like

852
00:46:19.320 --> 00:46:22.770
terrible editing.
There's this funny shit,
right?

853
00:46:22.771 --> 00:46:26.340
But it seems like he's just mean and stealing.
I don't think that's funny.
No,

854
00:46:26.700 --> 00:46:31.310
they're funny.
They're funny.
He's a mean scaler.
Oh Shit.

855
00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:36.330
Okay,
let's kill this and not as funny as I thought.
Sorry guys.

856
00:46:36.331 --> 00:46:39.770
Roll the funny shit.
It seems like a bad sketch.
Some of them,

857
00:46:41.750 --> 00:46:44.440
not that guy.
No,
he's not a little bit funny.

858
00:46:44.790 --> 00:46:47.260
It would probably sell more tickets for sure.
Yeah.

859
00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:50.860
See that's where it tied in from like super calm and respectful.

860
00:46:51.320 --> 00:46:54.540
It's hard to believe he was just in a cage fight.
Yeah Dude,

861
00:46:54.541 --> 00:46:57.630
he shut all that Darren till hype up quick.
I knew it was going to win.

862
00:46:57.810 --> 00:47:00.030
I would like to talk to Tyrone or do can see it.

863
00:47:00.050 --> 00:47:03.420
Sorry to interrupt and because how we caught him,
because Darren too,

864
00:47:03.421 --> 00:47:07.340
I made a video about this.
How Darren toe typically likes to fate and pumping.

865
00:47:07.341 --> 00:47:10.290
Get the guy backing up,
get them out of position and then land the cross.

866
00:47:10.380 --> 00:47:14.580
If we know from open stance from southpaw and there was a slight delay between

867
00:47:14.581 --> 00:47:18.420
those two to three punches that he throws and I'm wondering if Tyrone does

868
00:47:18.421 --> 00:47:22.200
research and seeing that Tyron is he say Tyrone now Tyrone is not coming down.

869
00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:27.050
Mr Woodley,
right?
It's tiring.
Would Tyron,
Tyron,
Tyron,
there's no to that.

870
00:47:27.090 --> 00:47:30.070
Now the joke when I'm in,
it's funny.
Kyron so that's what

871
00:47:30.070 --> 00:47:34.150
<v 1>you're saying.
I'm wondering if he,
if he,</v>

872
00:47:34.151 --> 00:47:37.180
if you read that from watching the videos previously and seeing that little gap

873
00:47:37.230 --> 00:47:37.850
in the,

874
00:47:37.850 --> 00:47:40.990
in his combinations they able to beat him to the punch or if you just duck and

875
00:47:40.991 --> 00:47:41.470
chucked.

876
00:47:41.470 --> 00:47:45.160
I'm curious to see if that was something that they trained in sought out or

877
00:47:45.250 --> 00:47:49.060
cause that takes balls,
right?
These coming in with his strongest punches,

878
00:47:49.061 --> 00:47:52.720
cross these knocked many people out with and he just stepped into it and beat

879
00:47:52.721 --> 00:47:54.130
him to the punch that that takes balls.

880
00:47:54.260 --> 00:47:58.670
<v 3>Tyron does is he always used that strategy of standing against the fence or</v>

881
00:47:58.671 --> 00:48:01.330
close to the fence.
And then when guys move any counters,

882
00:48:01.720 --> 00:48:03.650
I mean he did that with Josh Koscheck.

883
00:48:03.651 --> 00:48:07.370
He's done that with a lot of guys and Rory Mcdonald was the only guy to shut

884
00:48:07.371 --> 00:48:11.180
that down.
He figured out a way to shut it down.
He stayed long,
stayed long.

885
00:48:11.190 --> 00:48:14.830
He's a lot of front kicks about jabs.
Keep kept his uh,

886
00:48:14.930 --> 00:48:18.650
left hand up high to block a,
the right hand,
you know,
the big right hand.

887
00:48:18.890 --> 00:48:21.930
But man you is just faster than him.
Way Faster.

888
00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:25.370
Closed like lightning landed.

889
00:48:25.371 --> 00:48:27.560
That right hand beat the shit out of him on the ground.

890
00:48:27.800 --> 00:48:31.880
It was just shocking to me that Darren didn't know what to do when he was on his

891
00:48:31.881 --> 00:48:33.850
back.
Like in terms of like that type.

892
00:48:34.010 --> 00:48:36.620
That's how I thought the fight was going to go.
Like him just be on top of him.

893
00:48:36.621 --> 00:48:39.920
The whole fight.
I thought Tammy was just going to and be on top.

894
00:48:40.100 --> 00:48:42.170
Well I thought maybe that was part of the strategy too,

895
00:48:42.171 --> 00:48:45.680
especially when you saw them warming up cause Taryn was doing like a lot of like

896
00:48:45.681 --> 00:48:50.510
exchanges and then shoots for a double or closes the distance level changes.

897
00:48:50.690 --> 00:48:54.770
Like they did that when he was working with um,
a boxing coaches as well.

898
00:48:54.771 --> 00:48:58.380
He would hit the,
hit the meds and then move in a level change together.

899
00:48:58.730 --> 00:48:59.960
But I was just,
um,

900
00:49:00.380 --> 00:49:02.870
like till didn't understand the Darce was coming or didn't know.

901
00:49:02.871 --> 00:49:06.560
But then you got to wonder how battered was.
He took that big shot,

902
00:49:06.561 --> 00:49:09.480
took a lot of hard elbows on the ground.
How much was he really there?

903
00:49:09.890 --> 00:49:11.230
That's the beauty.
I'm sorry.
No,

904
00:49:11.231 --> 00:49:13.490
I was going to say because that Doris was a mile away.

905
00:49:13.760 --> 00:49:16.880
I mean it was there and then it was there and then he cinched it up deep.

906
00:49:16.881 --> 00:49:21.170
It was never like there was never a separation,
never pull in the hands back.

907
00:49:21.171 --> 00:49:23.720
There was think Tyron is a lot stronger than him to be able to hold him in that

908
00:49:23.790 --> 00:49:27.350
current position.
You know that he's a freak.
He's a beast.

909
00:49:27.370 --> 00:49:29.170
<v 1>It isn't why he's the champion,
but I think that's the,</v>

910
00:49:29.710 --> 00:49:33.370
well the way I choose to look at it any way is having a checklist.
Right?

911
00:49:33.371 --> 00:49:35.470
If you were to build up a mixed martial artists,

912
00:49:35.740 --> 00:49:38.950
how much information should they know?
Standing wrestling and then on the,

913
00:49:39.670 --> 00:49:41.020
<v 3>and this she just check,
check,</v>

914
00:49:41.021 --> 00:49:44.770
check and know all these basics should be covered before ego fight as a beauty,

915
00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:47.650
beauty of having a curriculum and again,
a checklist.
No,

916
00:49:47.651 --> 00:49:50.530
I absolutely agree with you.
I think you know,
understand it.

917
00:49:50.531 --> 00:49:54.070
I mean the days of just like being able to just fight someone and not know

918
00:49:54.071 --> 00:49:57.300
anything about them.
That seems kind of foolish.
Yeah.
Like,

919
00:49:57.310 --> 00:49:59.380
it seems like a massive advantage to study.

920
00:49:59.410 --> 00:50:03.940
Like when cowboy fought Darren till he decided to not watch any tape on him.

921
00:50:04.510 --> 00:50:08.590
He's like,
you know,
here's the striker good.
I loved strike.
Okay,

922
00:50:08.690 --> 00:50:10.810
might want to watch this Stryker.
Yeah,

923
00:50:11.400 --> 00:50:13.150
I'll watch taping the beginning with Dwayne.

924
00:50:13.300 --> 00:50:15.370
But then I kind of let him continue from there,
you know?

925
00:50:15.371 --> 00:50:17.750
And I trust his judgment on everything.
Um,

926
00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:19.260
and then when I'm out of fight camp since like,

927
00:50:19.261 --> 00:50:21.640
cause sometimes when you watch a tape in fight camp,

928
00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:23.500
like you can mess with people's heads,
you know,

929
00:50:23.501 --> 00:50:26.860
like the maybe maybe cowboys getting too nervous and then when he's white gives

930
00:50:26.861 --> 00:50:28.100
him to watch the fight.

931
00:50:28.560 --> 00:50:31.610
<v 2>You know,
you need to have it.
If that's the case,
you know,</v>

932
00:50:31.611 --> 00:50:34.580
have a coach that's willing to,
that you trust to do that for you.

933
00:50:34.670 --> 00:50:37.910
That's a good point.
Now cause let me do this.
A mental,
this fucking sports,

934
00:50:37.911 --> 00:50:41.630
a mental mind.
Fuck man.
You know,
of course,
whatever works the best for you.

935
00:50:41.631 --> 00:50:42.620
Is that what you got to figure out?

936
00:50:43.260 --> 00:50:48.260
Is it better for you to fight someone like Cody that you have all this animosity

937
00:50:48.261 --> 00:50:52.580
and beef towards and all this shit talking cause you get super hyped up and

938
00:50:52.581 --> 00:50:53.480
motivated every day?

939
00:50:53.510 --> 00:50:58.510
Or is it better to fight someone who you have a lot of respect for was just a

940
00:50:58.551 --> 00:51:01.100
good challenge?
I think a,

941
00:51:01.130 --> 00:51:03.920
you got to learn to like to be the same person for every fight.

942
00:51:04.640 --> 00:51:07.130
I think it's like control those emotions.
You know,

943
00:51:07.131 --> 00:51:10.460
even if there was all that coming in,
like I'm nervous to fight,
you know,

944
00:51:10.461 --> 00:51:13.370
like forget all the bullshit,
you know?
And I had to learn that through my career.

945
00:51:13.790 --> 00:51:16.850
I had to learn to take emotion out of it.
And even in sparring still,
you know,

946
00:51:16.851 --> 00:51:20.240
like John's always telling me,
control my emotion,
a controlled aggression,

947
00:51:20.270 --> 00:51:23.360
you know,
cause you hit me,
I want to hit you back.
I'm very competitive.

948
00:51:24.080 --> 00:51:25.610
So it's something you have to learn how to control.

949
00:51:25.611 --> 00:51:28.160
And I've had to do that throughout my career.
Um,

950
00:51:28.220 --> 00:51:33.220
and I think everyone has to learn to control either to let go or to pull back.

951
00:51:33.710 --> 00:51:37.730
You know,
I'm like really control that emotion to be the same person every fight,

952
00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:40.940
you know,
mentally,
mentally,
not the same person,

953
00:51:40.941 --> 00:51:43.550
every five a mentally like in your own head,
the same person,

954
00:51:43.880 --> 00:51:45.830
but technically need to be able to switch it up.

955
00:51:46.150 --> 00:51:49.910
That the mental aspect of it is probably the thing that holds more people back

956
00:51:49.911 --> 00:51:54.020
then anything like we all know of guys that are just monsters in the gym and for

957
00:51:54.021 --> 00:51:56.660
whatever it was when they would go to compete,

958
00:51:56.661 --> 00:52:01.580
they just could never be their full self.
Yeah.
Tj does better in the cage.

959
00:52:02.110 --> 00:52:05.720
Yeah,
it doesn't.
The Gym.
Yeah,
I was.
I was.
I did better in the,

960
00:52:05.721 --> 00:52:09.500
in the gym then in the cage.
What do you think it is that makes you do better?

961
00:52:09.560 --> 00:52:13.610
I love it.
I don't know and I've just taught myself to love this shit like I am.

962
00:52:13.611 --> 00:52:16.730
I'm like,
I don't know when I get out there it's just like I want to be there.

963
00:52:16.760 --> 00:52:19.010
You know?
Like,
I know everyone's nervous and like they're like,

964
00:52:19.670 --> 00:52:20.481
it's the highest highs.

965
00:52:20.481 --> 00:52:23.270
But I used to be so nervous that I forget like what happened in the fight,

966
00:52:23.271 --> 00:52:25.790
you know?
But throughout my career,
I think after the Mike Easton fights,

967
00:52:25.791 --> 00:52:28.670
when I really started to like hone in our,

968
00:52:28.671 --> 00:52:31.430
during the Mike Easton fight is when I really started to hone in and have fun

969
00:52:31.431 --> 00:52:33.830
and uh,
just realize like,
fuck this shit man.

970
00:52:33.830 --> 00:52:37.010
Like what's the worst is going to happen?
They knocked out row for it,
you know?

971
00:52:37.011 --> 00:52:41.850
How's his Funky Easton?
I Dunno.
I Dunno.
How has it been around for a while?
Yeah.

972
00:52:41.970 --> 00:52:45.560
I'm not really sure.
There's a possible super fight with you and Henry.

973
00:52:45.561 --> 00:52:48.170
So who the hell he ain't talked about?
Hell yeah.
What'd you find them at?

974
00:52:48.171 --> 00:52:50.780
One 25 25 s yeah,
absolutely.

975
00:52:50.781 --> 00:52:53.990
I don't want no excuses that I'm the bigger man and he probably is bigger than

976
00:52:53.991 --> 00:52:55.670
you,
quite honestly.
Yeah.
That's what I'm saying.

977
00:52:55.671 --> 00:52:59.400
Like 20 struggles to get to 34 from a two down to 25,

978
00:52:59.480 --> 00:53:03.210
25 or 30 especially with the coach I have now.
Sam Kalvia.
It's like,
well,

979
00:53:03.260 --> 00:53:07.370
I was told I was going to fight Demetrius Johnson the summer before I fought

980
00:53:07.371 --> 00:53:10.520
Cody the first time because Cody had to pull out because this was back within

981
00:53:10.521 --> 00:53:13.910
three weeks of time.
I got down to waking up to 140 pounds by changing my,

982
00:53:13.940 --> 00:53:17.640
the way I'm working out,
changing my calories,
changing my macro nutrients and uh,

983
00:53:17.730 --> 00:53:19.460
myself like just going full bore.

984
00:53:19.460 --> 00:53:22.880
Like I was able to start waking up in the morning 140 pounds within three weeks.

985
00:53:23.060 --> 00:53:26.370
And so right now you're about 10 plus pounds heavier than that.

986
00:53:27.050 --> 00:53:29.850
And how much time would you need?
Like if they said,
hey,

987
00:53:29.940 --> 00:53:33.040
December 31st New Year's Eve.
Super Fun.
Yeah,
my coach,

988
00:53:33.270 --> 00:53:36.650
my coach always wants to like the like actual,
like he told me like before,

989
00:53:36.660 --> 00:53:38.460
after my last fight,
I mean,
he's 16 weeks,
but I mean,

990
00:53:38.461 --> 00:53:41.700
obviously we could do it a lot fast.
I could've made 25 cents last fight,
um,

991
00:53:41.701 --> 00:53:43.530
with how much water I had in me.
The,
the,

992
00:53:43.860 --> 00:53:46.920
the hydration that he's got me going on when I get close to a fight too,

993
00:53:46.921 --> 00:53:51.480
is it's easiest.
I don't do,
I don't you do baths anymore.

994
00:53:51.481 --> 00:53:55.320
Like I to make weight.
I walked on the treadmill with plastics for how long?

995
00:53:55.820 --> 00:54:00.510
Um,
the day of,
I'd say 30 minutes.
I sat in us on a little bit.

996
00:54:00.580 --> 00:54:03.840
So you're only losing like four or five pounds most,
right?
Yeah.
In the morning.

997
00:54:03.841 --> 00:54:07.130
Yeah.
Probably like three or four or five pounds.
Yeah.
That's,

998
00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:11.520
that's a massive benefit to you in terms of your conditioning.
Oh,
huge.

999
00:54:11.670 --> 00:54:14.940
He ain't having fluid on your brain,
your cardio,

1000
00:54:15.740 --> 00:54:18.810
you're muscular contraction in the endurance.
I mean,
everything.
I mean,

1001
00:54:18.811 --> 00:54:20.190
when you deplete yourself like that,

1002
00:54:20.280 --> 00:54:22.080
like you're talking about during until maybe cutting too much weight,

1003
00:54:22.081 --> 00:54:26.010
I could definitely be a possibility,
you know?
I mean,
he's huge tills.

1004
00:54:26.011 --> 00:54:30.360
A big guy to get down to one 70.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean that is the,

1005
00:54:30.570 --> 00:54:34.500
it's the trying to find the right balance where you're big for the weight class,

1006
00:54:34.501 --> 00:54:38.550
but you're not diminishing yourself really drastically to get down to your

1007
00:54:38.551 --> 00:54:42.390
weight class in the hinders did thing also entertains me so much cause he's a

1008
00:54:42.391 --> 00:54:43.620
gold medalist and he wants to,

1009
00:54:43.621 --> 00:54:45.990
he wants to claim himself as the greatest combat athlete ever.

1010
00:54:45.990 --> 00:54:47.730
I'm a UFC champion.
I'm a gold medalist.

1011
00:54:47.731 --> 00:54:49.490
Like I'll go out there and beat you in wrestling.

1012
00:54:49.500 --> 00:54:52.470
MMA wrestling is completely different.
I'm the better athlete I'm going to.

1013
00:54:52.471 --> 00:54:55.770
I could beat him anywhere.
I know I can watch him fight.
Um,

1014
00:54:55.830 --> 00:54:57.280
so that's why I'm very excited about,

1015
00:54:57.300 --> 00:55:01.290
I think it's the greatest thing for my name right now.
Um,
I,
I'm very,

1016
00:55:01.291 --> 00:55:04.650
it excites me a lot.
Excites me a lot too,
to be able to show the science behind,

1017
00:55:05.040 --> 00:55:08.770
not only myself and my coach and,
and,
and Dwayne in the system,
like every,

1018
00:55:08.800 --> 00:55:11.430
like I'm all in,
dude,
whatever we're doing,

1019
00:55:11.431 --> 00:55:14.760
I'm 100% and I don't take any shortcuts and uh,

1020
00:55:15.030 --> 00:55:17.970
I want to show that I'm going to show that I could make 20 fives and be my best

1021
00:55:17.971 --> 00:55:21.840
ever as well.
Now Demetrius is injured.
Yeah.
Right.
He's,

1022
00:55:21.841 --> 00:55:25.050
he's out for a little while.
So this is one of the reasons why the Talker,

1023
00:55:25.090 --> 00:55:28.740
the super is coming up.
Yeah.
Like it is Demetrius gonna need a few months.

1024
00:55:28.741 --> 00:55:33.210
So you can't have an immediate rematch.
So have they talked to you about it?

1025
00:55:33.480 --> 00:55:36.720
Proposed?
You know,
there's been some,
there's nothing been like serious,

1026
00:55:36.721 --> 00:55:40.470
but there's been like a hints and like we did our media tour together and they

1027
00:55:40.471 --> 00:55:43.680
put us on camera together and had us talk shit to each other.
Nice.

1028
00:55:44.020 --> 00:55:46.250
I mean they didn't like,
they didn't say that,
you know what I mean?

1029
00:55:46.251 --> 00:55:48.960
Cause everything's real.
Everything we do is real,
but it's like,
oh shit,

1030
00:55:48.961 --> 00:55:50.760
this is what you guys want.
You know?
And like,

1031
00:55:50.761 --> 00:55:53.340
you really think you could beat me then fuck you man,
let's do this shit.

1032
00:55:53.370 --> 00:55:56.180
You know,
like that's where I get my motivation from,
from fighting is,

1033
00:55:56.181 --> 00:55:59.970
is not the anger,
not it's,
it's the,
the competition.

1034
00:56:00.150 --> 00:56:03.420
And does he want to go to 35 is that he told me face to face.

1035
00:56:03.430 --> 00:56:06.360
He's willing to do at 25 25 yeah.
Yeah.

1036
00:56:06.361 --> 00:56:07.870
That's when he first set up to the fights that he wanted.

1037
00:56:08.040 --> 00:56:10.830
He wanted to the super fight.
Right.
That's what he's his idea.

1038
00:56:10.831 --> 00:56:13.050
So he said come to 35 so I told him,
I'm like,
look for doing this.

1039
00:56:13.051 --> 00:56:15.360
I'm coming to 25 so I have no problem with that.

1040
00:56:15.860 --> 00:56:20.850
He's got more street credit to drop the divisions.
Division j right?
Oh yeah.

1041
00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:23.130
Yeah.
It gives you more street crash for sure.
Well

1042
00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:26.650
<v 0>the bigger man,
I don't want him to come 35 then you whip his ass to be like,</v>

1043
00:56:26.680 --> 00:56:28.530
oh well he's cause he's a 35 pound year.

1044
00:56:28.570 --> 00:56:33.200
He's a 35 pound or two I'll whoop your ass.
He,
he's a huge one.
20 fiver.
Hmm.

1045
00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:35.320
He really is.
Can you take out the weight cutting?

1046
00:56:35.321 --> 00:56:37.220
Just not much difference between you two guys.
Yeah.

1047
00:56:37.390 --> 00:56:39.770
And when you stay then how much better I am.
Oh,

1048
00:56:42.290 --> 00:56:44.910
that's true.
Ooh Henry,
hang on.
Um,

1049
00:56:45.040 --> 00:56:48.700
but when you saw him and Demetrius together,
I mean he's a much bigger person.

1050
00:56:48.950 --> 00:56:52.660
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
He,
well,
how much weight did he lose?

1051
00:56:54.240 --> 00:56:56.490
Yeah,
so I don't know.
Good question.

1052
00:56:56.530 --> 00:56:59.140
He's gotta be in the 50s when he shows up to fight week.

1053
00:56:59.141 --> 00:57:02.890
He looks like he's cutting weight already.
You know when I show up to fight week,

1054
00:57:02.891 --> 00:57:06.880
I haven't even really started yet,
Ma.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean for your,

1055
00:57:07.030 --> 00:57:08.530
your pace and your endurance,

1056
00:57:08.531 --> 00:57:11.770
that's gotta be a big benefit to know that your body is 100% healthy going in

1057
00:57:11.771 --> 00:57:16.000
there in terms of like not being dehydrated and there's so many guys,

1058
00:57:16.001 --> 00:57:18.430
you see them on the day of the way and you go,

1059
00:57:18.431 --> 00:57:20.860
I don't know how the fuck you going to fight in 24 hours.

1060
00:57:21.070 --> 00:57:23.800
I think head traumas a lot more prevalent when you're dehydrated.

1061
00:57:23.900 --> 00:57:26.920
They going through camp like I've known some guys that have cut a lot of weight

1062
00:57:26.921 --> 00:57:30.460
and it's already have hindered their careers.
And you know,

1063
00:57:30.461 --> 00:57:33.220
because you're having those all out spars,
I mean,
you're going,

1064
00:57:33.700 --> 00:57:37.000
you have to go as hard as you can and sparring money ready for a fight.

1065
00:57:37.480 --> 00:57:40.090
Like you're going for your timing,
you're going for,
you're fighting,
right.
I mean,

1066
00:57:40.091 --> 00:57:43.540
you don't do it all the time.
We,
there's,
there's times when you're sparring,

1067
00:57:43.541 --> 00:57:48.430
you're sparring like a fight for the most part.
I mean,
I'm not larger gloves or,

1068
00:57:48.790 --> 00:57:51.850
uh,
no.
Well,
we've been doing smaller Gulf and aspiring to,
but those,

1069
00:57:51.910 --> 00:57:55.070
those puffy that I have,
they are,
uh,

1070
00:57:55.240 --> 00:57:57.790
I feel like as padded as my 16th.
It depends where,

1071
00:57:57.850 --> 00:58:01.700
it depends on where they put the padding.
Padding on the knuckles,
I mean,

1072
00:58:02.030 --> 00:58:06.620
not thicker than 16 months.
Companies,
gloves to use for that animal.
Santa Ball.

1073
00:58:06.730 --> 00:58:09.590
Always tenable.
Yeah.
The one you had w where's that from?
Um,

1074
00:58:09.790 --> 00:58:12.520
well their offices in New York,
but the guy,

1075
00:58:12.521 --> 00:58:15.130
the owner is living out here in California.
Is that a new company?

1076
00:58:15.700 --> 00:58:18.730
It's been around.
It's fresh.
It's somewhat new.
It's not brand new.

1077
00:58:18.731 --> 00:58:22.900
I think they've been around since 14,
14.
But yeah,
I make great stuff.

1078
00:58:22.901 --> 00:58:26.230
I mean they have,
they're puffy sparring.
Gloves are awesome to bill to get,
uh,

1079
00:58:27.090 --> 00:58:29.200
to get real rounds in.
Cause when I grapple I can't,

1080
00:58:29.320 --> 00:58:33.700
I can't do fully made rounds with a big puffy clothes on boxing gloves.
Those,

1081
00:58:33.880 --> 00:58:37.170
they're puffy around the knuckles.
But you still grip with them?
Yeah.

1082
00:58:37.490 --> 00:58:38.950
So grew up with them and got everything.
I mean,

1083
00:58:38.951 --> 00:58:40.950
the only thing that's different is like the padding on your,
uh,

1084
00:58:41.230 --> 00:58:43.630
I for like can't you don't throw him but like having your face or your thumb,

1085
00:58:43.631 --> 00:58:46.450
you gotta be careful with your thumb so you really have to be accurate with your

1086
00:58:46.451 --> 00:58:47.284
punches.

1087
00:58:47.500 --> 00:58:51.940
And I'm with does it fuck with you if you're working submissions with the extra

1088
00:58:51.941 --> 00:58:54.520
padding on the knuckles?
Absolutely.
I mean we're naked.

1089
00:58:54.521 --> 00:58:57.220
Chokes are harder to get the hand behind the head and guys,

1090
00:58:57.221 --> 00:59:00.490
guys can get out of submissions easier because they can grab more of the glove

1091
00:59:00.520 --> 00:59:01.600
even though they're not supposed to.

1092
00:59:01.720 --> 00:59:04.540
<v 1>Can I say something real quick because Tj was saying that,
you know,</v>

1093
00:59:04.541 --> 00:59:06.780
as far as hard sometimes.
Right.
So I tried to have,

1094
00:59:06.781 --> 00:59:10.290
my guys don't want to say it and so a sparring hard,
you do have to spar hard,

1095
00:59:10.560 --> 00:59:12.180
but we would have him do that once a week.

1096
00:59:12.181 --> 00:59:15.390
But we do a whole bunch of sparring drills throughout the week as well to get

1097
00:59:15.690 --> 00:59:18.600
better technically understand the distance and the timing.

1098
00:59:18.810 --> 00:59:20.160
But you do need to spar hard,

1099
00:59:20.161 --> 00:59:23.640
but it's not like you're hurting the guy if he's rocked or whatever.

1100
00:59:23.641 --> 00:59:24.770
You're not getting,
not going to knock him out,

1101
00:59:24.771 --> 00:59:27.560
but you'll still on with with good forced too because you do have to experience

1102
00:59:27.561 --> 00:59:31.550
that for sure.
But rocks,
you just hit him to the bottom right?
No,
for sure.
Yeah.

1103
00:59:31.600 --> 00:59:32.710
If you were coming,
you know,

1104
00:59:32.800 --> 00:59:35.780
heard him to the body and the suddenly I'll say get hit her to the body and you

1105
00:59:35.781 --> 00:59:37.850
know,
work out of that as well.
Don't,
don't take a knee.

1106
00:59:38.780 --> 00:59:41.300
Wanted to make sure that was clear because that's one of the things I feel I've

1107
00:59:41.301 --> 00:59:42.134
been able to do is

1108
00:59:43.520 --> 00:59:46.640
dissect the chaos of a fight and slowly manipulatives so we can actually

1109
00:59:46.641 --> 00:59:47.990
understand the layers and get better at it.

1110
00:59:47.991 --> 00:59:50.240
And that helped a lot with the actual drilling and sparring,

1111
00:59:50.241 --> 00:59:52.490
drilling and sparring and then the fight itself.

1112
00:59:52.491 --> 00:59:54.350
So understand that latter process.
Have you ever

1113
00:59:54.560 --> 00:59:59.210
<v 2>on any core drills or ab drills that allow you to absorb punches or kicks</v>

1114
00:59:59.211 --> 01:00:03.560
better?
Is there anything that you've shown if you ever figured out,

1115
01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:05.300
I don't know if it does do it.

1116
01:00:05.390 --> 01:00:08.080
I mean we have a coach throws medicine balls against,

1117
01:00:08.100 --> 01:00:12.050
we're like we're doing motion movements are doing on a balancing and a tire or

1118
01:00:12.380 --> 01:00:13.970
doing it almost like a burpee motion or something.

1119
01:00:13.971 --> 01:00:16.730
Getting back to your feet and slam it like a big medicine ball and your stomach.

1120
01:00:16.731 --> 01:00:18.830
I mean I think,

1121
01:00:18.890 --> 01:00:22.640
I just think the impact without hurting yourself is going to help ultimately and

1122
01:00:22.641 --> 01:00:24.860
then just having a stronger core in general.
I think,

1123
01:00:26.300 --> 01:00:29.990
I think core is by far the most important and in May and Jujitsu and in

1124
01:00:29.991 --> 01:00:33.440
grappling is your core strength is how strong your core is,
is like,

1125
01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:36.410
cause I can go and lift weights and this guy's going to be way stronger than me

1126
01:00:36.411 --> 01:00:39.680
doing bench or doing a dead lifts,
whatever it may be.

1127
01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:42.320
But we get on the mat and he's like,
dude,
how the fuck are you so strong?

1128
01:00:42.680 --> 01:00:46.550
I think it's all core.
It's certainly,
there's a lot to do with kicking power.

1129
01:00:47.170 --> 01:00:49.460
So it's so much of it.
It's not just the legs,

1130
01:00:49.461 --> 01:00:52.340
it's the ability to whip this to hips into it.
All this,

1131
01:00:52.950 --> 01:00:56.960
that's all your core and your cardio.
It controls your breathing.
Um,

1132
01:00:57.170 --> 01:00:59.810
I think it's really,
I believe quarters and everything.

1133
01:00:59.870 --> 01:01:03.290
What kind of exercises are you doing for that?
This is endless.

1134
01:01:03.291 --> 01:01:05.270
I mean a lot of medicine ball stuff.

1135
01:01:05.300 --> 01:01:09.890
Are you doing different things with Mr Colavito?
Yeah.
You doing before?
Yes.
Yeah,

1136
01:01:09.891 --> 01:01:14.720
completely.
Um,
actually the shit's crazy.
Yeah.
It's straight up crazy man.

1137
01:01:14.721 --> 01:01:18.260
Like I've like the first time I showed up I knew it was going to be hard.

1138
01:01:18.261 --> 01:01:20.350
Like I've always told me like,
oh,
he's like,
you go hard man.

1139
01:01:20.360 --> 01:01:22.450
Like I've never gone to heart as hard as it,

1140
01:01:22.470 --> 01:01:26.750
this guy pushes me ever in my life from the all the years of me practicing.

1141
01:01:26.751 --> 01:01:29.600
You're competing,
but it,
it,
you can only do it so many times.

1142
01:01:29.990 --> 01:01:32.240
You can't do it all the time.
And he knows when,

1143
01:01:32.430 --> 01:01:34.970
when the next practice should be easier or when we're going to have those days

1144
01:01:34.971 --> 01:01:37.100
where I'm for sure going to throw up,
you know,

1145
01:01:37.101 --> 01:01:41.270
or like what days I'm pushing a sled up the hill.
Uh,
we do a lot of,
um,

1146
01:01:41.330 --> 01:01:46.280
cycling now I'm on the bike constantly,
but it's not only for low base,

1147
01:01:46.281 --> 01:01:48.710
at certain power intervals,
doing distance,

1148
01:01:48.711 --> 01:01:52.700
like actual bike on the road or the idea that too.
Um,
so if I,
if I fight 25,

1149
01:01:52.701 --> 01:01:56.240
so I'll be doing a lot of roadwork,
um,
running swimming.

1150
01:01:56.660 --> 01:01:59.660
I'm privileged to try to make 25,
it'll be a triathlete as well.

1151
01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:02.240
I'll be doing some Cameron Hanes shit.
Well,
I only run in that fire,

1152
01:02:02.241 --> 01:02:06.560
but I'll be trying to act like Cameron Hanes,
um,
to get smaller.
But,
uh,

1153
01:02:07.730 --> 01:02:10.640
yeah,
so the,
I think the bike work does a lot for our core as well too,

1154
01:02:10.641 --> 01:02:12.190
because your core is not only your stomach,
you know,

1155
01:02:12.191 --> 01:02:15.470
and of course from your hamstrings up to your back,
throughout your career,

1156
01:02:15.510 --> 01:02:18.020
throughout your stomach,
it's,
it controls a lot,
you know.

1157
01:02:18.021 --> 01:02:20.660
So even even doing the bike work is,
is a lot of it

1158
01:02:20.700 --> 01:02:22.110
<v 3>court work as well too.
Yeah.</v>

1159
01:02:22.111 --> 01:02:24.480
People don't realize that sometimes when you have lower back pain it's cause

1160
01:02:24.481 --> 01:02:27.380
your hamstrings are too tight.
Yeah.
You tell him that and like what?
Yeah.

1161
01:02:27.570 --> 01:02:30.190
And then they learn how to stretch out their hamstrings and like,
yeah,

1162
01:02:30.210 --> 01:02:33.450
my back feels better.
Yeah.
So Yoga is all about,
man,

1163
01:02:33.530 --> 01:02:36.050
<v 2>hell yeah,
we do,
we do yoga.
I mean everything.
I mean there's,</v>

1164
01:02:36.051 --> 01:02:38.210
there's so much beyond what we have to do.

1165
01:02:38.570 --> 01:02:43.280
And how long has this guy been doing this?
So Mark Munoz was his first,

1166
01:02:43.370 --> 01:02:47.380
um,
project and may he wrestled.
And so he was a wrestler.
He wrestled the,

1167
01:02:47.810 --> 01:02:51.320
I'm always been around wrestling and he's helped mark with his wrestling camps.

1168
01:02:51.350 --> 01:02:54.170
Um,
his kids.
Right.
So he's got that wrestling mentality.
Um,

1169
01:02:54.171 --> 01:02:55.940
but then he's just a genius as well.

1170
01:02:56.270 --> 01:02:59.350
And so his first projects was Mark Munoz when he was making weight and looking

1171
01:02:59.370 --> 01:03:02.360
shredded,
the Tim Boetsch fight,
things like that.

1172
01:03:02.361 --> 01:03:04.400
That was when you first started helping out.

1173
01:03:04.401 --> 01:03:07.190
So that's why it's called the training lab as well as spelled with rain in the

1174
01:03:07.191 --> 01:03:08.380
middle,
um,

1175
01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:12.470
is because he was attached to Mark Munoz as Jim and helping him out and Mark

1176
01:03:12.470 --> 01:03:15.560
Munis jam for people will know it was called rain.
Yes.
Rain.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1177
01:03:15.561 --> 01:03:17.660
And so I think that it's funny,
it's come full circle.
I mean,

1178
01:03:17.661 --> 01:03:19.330
Mark Munoz is the one that talked me into fighting.

1179
01:03:19.340 --> 01:03:22.220
He's my coach at cal state Fullerton wrestling.
Um,

1180
01:03:22.221 --> 01:03:23.390
and he was in the UFC at the time,

1181
01:03:23.391 --> 01:03:27.180
was my assistant coach after I graduated college,
like all bummed out.

1182
01:03:27.181 --> 01:03:28.520
I didn't do like what it should have.

1183
01:03:28.930 --> 01:03:31.400
And so I didn't feel like I was done competing sort of fallen mark around and

1184
01:03:31.401 --> 01:03:33.320
doing Jujitsu and all this shit.

1185
01:03:33.321 --> 01:03:35.600
And I was actually enrolled in Grad school at the same time to become a

1186
01:03:35.601 --> 01:03:36.620
physician's assistant.

1187
01:03:36.980 --> 01:03:39.880
He pretty much talked me into dropping out of school and give him a fighting

1188
01:03:39.881 --> 01:03:42.890
chance because he thought I'd be good at it and now it's come full circle and

1189
01:03:42.891 --> 01:03:44.870
now he's our coach again.
Wow.
Yeah.

1190
01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:47.950
<v 3>He's got some awesome MMA flow drills.
Mark Munoz.
Yeah.</v>

1191
01:03:48.220 --> 01:03:51.610
It's been good wrestling forum in May.
Yeah.
You can't just be like a nice,

1192
01:03:51.730 --> 01:03:54.430
<v 2>awesome wrestler and come in and teach him and everything.
You know,</v>

1193
01:03:54.431 --> 01:03:58.230
you gotta know how to punch.
You got to know the Jujitsu aspects of it.
Um,

1194
01:03:58.260 --> 01:03:59.760
MMA wrestling,
it's its own sport or,

1195
01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:01.240
<v 3>yeah.
Well it certainly,</v>

1196
01:04:01.241 --> 01:04:03.810
there's certainly rules that you have to file that you don't have to fall and

1197
01:04:03.811 --> 01:04:07.840
regular wrestling things,
you know,
that's the case.
Would you Jitsu as well.

1198
01:04:07.841 --> 01:04:10.810
It certainly helps to learn Jujitsu.
One of the things,

1199
01:04:10.811 --> 01:04:12.160
I don't know if you guys are paying attention to,

1200
01:04:12.161 --> 01:04:14.830
but Eddie Bravo came up with a thing called Combat Jujitsu,

1201
01:04:14.980 --> 01:04:19.000
which is sort of an intermediary step between regular Jujitsu and MMA.

1202
01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:23.420
And it's basically Jujitsu with bitch slabs.
Pancreas.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1203
01:04:23.470 --> 01:04:28.020
But some of those bitch slaps the poms.
Well,
boss figured out how to do it.

1204
01:04:28.330 --> 01:04:31.870
He figured out how to pull his hands way back and he was basically punching you

1205
01:04:31.871 --> 01:04:34.030
with his palm where you could hit anybody.

1206
01:04:34.031 --> 01:04:36.430
Anywhere you get to hit him in the forehead,
you'd have to,

1207
01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:37.780
you don't have to worry about your knuckles.

1208
01:04:37.810 --> 01:04:41.230
I feel like that's harder than my MMA glove.
Yeah,
I think so too.
Yeah.

1209
01:04:41.231 --> 01:04:44.830
I mean you could really put a beating on somebody with palms is an innovator for

1210
01:04:44.831 --> 01:04:47.530
sure.
He's a boy.
He taught me how to think,

1211
01:04:47.910 --> 01:04:52.420
how to be open minded and figure stuff out.
Yeah,
so here it is.
This is combat.

1212
01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:55.660
This is combat.
You just do it.
That's a guy on the ground,
I think.
I hope

1213
01:04:58.070 --> 01:05:02.650
Donald Harrison,
this is otherwise it's fucked up.
That one to pick up Jamie.

1214
01:05:03.460 --> 01:05:06.670
That's where the whole equal attacking the leg situations,

1215
01:05:06.710 --> 01:05:09.810
James's actual fight and you have hunches,
right?
Yeah.

1216
01:05:09.890 --> 01:05:12.310
They watch attacking those legs.
I mean you,

1217
01:05:12.311 --> 01:05:16.390
you opened up things the same way you would open up things with punches.

1218
01:05:16.450 --> 01:05:20.590
You know there is Bam is that one of my affiliate students from Montana with the

1219
01:05:20.830 --> 01:05:24.460
blonde hair barring the roaches stopped quite a few people.

1220
01:05:24.490 --> 01:05:27.370
While he's topped at least one person with just a slaps.

1221
01:05:27.640 --> 01:05:31.390
But he's used those slaps.
No.
And Wagner has a,

1222
01:05:31.450 --> 01:05:35.410
he's got a big advantage in being a high level MMA fighter as well heading into

1223
01:05:35.411 --> 01:05:37.400
this.
But there,
um,

1224
01:05:38.560 --> 01:05:43.540
the idea behind it was created by Eddie because he wanted to make it just a

1225
01:05:43.541 --> 01:05:45.090
little bit more realistic on the ground.

1226
01:05:45.170 --> 01:05:48.790
Add this other element to it because there's times where guys are going for leg

1227
01:05:48.791 --> 01:05:51.820
locks and you know your,
your face is wide open.

1228
01:05:51.821 --> 01:05:55.660
You're committing both your arms to the person's leg and that person's in a

1229
01:05:55.661 --> 01:05:57.340
position where they could just smash your face.

1230
01:05:57.690 --> 01:06:01.930
And if you're used to that in Jiu Jitsu gym where a guy can punch you and you

1231
01:06:01.931 --> 01:06:05.520
just think you're safe and you always practice in that way.
Thank you.

1232
01:06:05.590 --> 01:06:09.280
Combat Jujitsu is a real wake up call and just getting fucking,
and

1233
01:06:11.010 --> 01:06:13.870
the argument goes instructor at our art academy,
Sam Kootz,

1234
01:06:14.260 --> 01:06:18.100
he teaches Jujitsu for self defense and then he asks you if you want to compete

1235
01:06:18.101 --> 01:06:20.670
in Jiu Jitsu.
They teach two different Jujitsu.
He wants to figure out,

1236
01:06:20.710 --> 01:06:24.000
find out why did you come here,
what your,
you want to get better,

1237
01:06:24.001 --> 01:06:24.761
you want to jump the fence,

1238
01:06:24.761 --> 01:06:27.250
you want to compete because there's a different way you have to approach things

1239
01:06:27.251 --> 01:06:27.910
for sure.

1240
01:06:27.910 --> 01:06:31.840
Which is why Tj can be on the same mat with regular students in my gym because

1241
01:06:32.050 --> 01:06:33.310
he's doing slightly,

1242
01:06:33.311 --> 01:06:36.850
have a different drill in combination with more contact than the average person,

1243
01:06:36.851 --> 01:06:40.750
you know.
So you'll get out what you put in and in your academy,

1244
01:06:40.751 --> 01:06:44.650
do you have everything there?
Do you have submission instruction,

1245
01:06:44.890 --> 01:06:48.620
wrestling or do you go different places for you Jujitsu?
How do you do it?
Uh,

1246
01:06:48.650 --> 01:06:51.460
the only thing I do,
I'm not at my gym is my Jujitsu.

1247
01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:56.080
I go to Gracie Baha and Irvine with a flip it and Monica.
Great spot.
Yeah man,

1248
01:06:56.081 --> 01:06:59.430
he's,
he's a straight up an engine.
He knows Jujitsu for MMA.

1249
01:06:59.450 --> 01:07:00.071
Just like you're saying.

1250
01:07:00.071 --> 01:07:03.630
Mark Munoz wrestling for MMA and I probably have striking for him away.
He,

1251
01:07:03.730 --> 01:07:07.780
Tj has a really good camp around him.
I would have liked to be in his position.

1252
01:07:07.810 --> 01:07:10.840
Now with the understanding of martial arts.
I'm not gonna hijack podcast.
Sorry,

1253
01:07:11.620 --> 01:07:12.550
I'm just so happy for him

1254
01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:19.600
is,
I mean,
like I told him the other day,

1255
01:07:19.601 --> 01:07:22.680
we were texting about like Tammy were meant for this shit in music has video.

1256
01:07:22.681 --> 01:07:25.690
It's like,
dude,
this is our journey though.
You know,
like this is,

1257
01:07:25.691 --> 01:07:28.090
I'm not doing this shit alone.
If I was doing it alone,
it'd be a lot harder.

1258
01:07:28.091 --> 01:07:30.610
I'm not saying I couldn't do it by where I don't,
I wouldn't be to this level.

1259
01:07:30.611 --> 01:07:33.060
I wouldn't be who I am.
I told him this is our journey,
you know,

1260
01:07:33.070 --> 01:07:36.010
I mean that's why this shit works cause I don't have a bigger ego.

1261
01:07:36.010 --> 01:07:37.390
I'm not like whatever.

1262
01:07:37.391 --> 01:07:40.870
You know that me and Dwayne really see eye to eye and I family now,

1263
01:07:41.330 --> 01:07:42.590
he's family now.
So it's,

1264
01:07:42.591 --> 01:07:45.700
it's so critical the relationship that you guys have because I think it's,

1265
01:07:45.850 --> 01:07:46.690
there's,
there's,

1266
01:07:46.930 --> 01:07:51.850
he can add so much in terms of what he understands and your acceptance of him

1267
01:07:51.851 --> 01:07:56.800
and your appreciation of him allows you guys to like fully integrate to this one

1268
01:07:56.801 --> 01:08:01.180
project of Tj Dillashaw world champion making you the best you could be if there

1269
01:08:01.181 --> 01:08:04.600
was any sort of conflict or you gotta be number one or you don't want to listen

1270
01:08:04.601 --> 01:08:06.010
to him.
I'm going to do what I want to do today.

1271
01:08:06.011 --> 01:08:09.610
Like that shit happens all the time with coaches and fighters and fighters.

1272
01:08:09.611 --> 01:08:12.430
And then sometimes you don't hear about it until after the fight and you're
like,

1273
01:08:12.431 --> 01:08:15.040
what happened?
I gotta tell you man,
it wouldn't show up for training.

1274
01:08:15.050 --> 01:08:15.980
He was this and that.
He's

1275
01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:19.100
<v 1>got this new girlfriend,
she's pregnant and blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,</v>

1276
01:08:19.101 --> 01:08:22.120
blah,
blah,
blah.
That's why I'm all in because Tj is all in.
Yeah.
Dot.

1277
01:08:22.130 --> 01:08:24.110
I don't have a vast stable of fighters.

1278
01:08:24.111 --> 01:08:26.420
I have a few guys that float through my place.
Right.

1279
01:08:26.690 --> 01:08:30.620
I worked with them a little bit here and there,
but Tj is all in,
so I'm all in

1280
01:08:30.820 --> 01:08:35.130
<v 2>now.
One of the benefits of being in Colorado was the altitude.
Are you?</v>

1281
01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:38.260
You don't think so?
No.
It depends where he fight.
What do you think?

1282
01:08:38.950 --> 01:08:40.690
Because you can train a lot harder at sea level.

1283
01:08:40.750 --> 01:08:42.280
Your body gets a little more dance,

1284
01:08:42.281 --> 01:08:46.390
like the oxygen and your recovery at sea level is way better.
I mean,

1285
01:08:46.420 --> 01:08:48.940
when I first started going up to Colorado and training at altitude,

1286
01:08:48.941 --> 01:08:53.620
I felt like my body wasn't recovering as I felt older man cause a lack of air up

1287
01:08:53.621 --> 01:08:57.060
there.
Yeah.
I think the lack of,
of rebuilding myself,
you know,

1288
01:08:57.080 --> 01:09:00.610
we do altitude training,
we do altitude,
it's called Alto lab.

1289
01:09:00.790 --> 01:09:04.700
Something I breathed into at certain times,
certain time links,
um,

1290
01:09:04.970 --> 01:09:08.260
to really like different intervals throughout the,
um,
throughout training camp.

1291
01:09:08.830 --> 01:09:12.580
Um,
instead of living in,
in breathing altitude,

1292
01:09:12.780 --> 01:09:16.000
I'd really get to recovery and the hard training from sea level and then use the

1293
01:09:16.001 --> 01:09:18.430
altitude to get in that hypoxic state.

1294
01:09:18.430 --> 01:09:22.870
So the reason why less auction air,
you create more red blood cells.

1295
01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:25.480
And the more red blood cells you have,
the more oxygen you transport.

1296
01:09:25.481 --> 01:09:28.000
And so they're thinking if you go down to sea level,

1297
01:09:28.001 --> 01:09:29.680
you're going to have more oxygen to transport,

1298
01:09:29.681 --> 01:09:34.681
but your body hasn't able to train as hard in recover as it can at sea level.

1299
01:09:35.590 --> 01:09:40.590
And then use the hypoxic state by breathing in this machine to get the red blood

1300
01:09:40.751 --> 01:09:43.470
cell production.
Okay.
So you can get the benefit,

1301
01:09:43.480 --> 01:09:45.850
makes an altitude without having to live there.

1302
01:09:46.180 --> 01:09:49.540
What I had heard is that the best move was to train at sea level,

1303
01:09:49.541 --> 01:09:53.380
but live at high altitude.
I don't think,
I mean,

1304
01:09:53.620 --> 01:09:56.260
I don't think your recovery is good enough.
What about those?

1305
01:09:56.261 --> 01:10:00.370
And what my coaches told me,
you know,
it makes sense to,
this is making sense.

1306
01:10:00.820 --> 01:10:04.690
What do you think about those tents where people sleep in those tents?

1307
01:10:05.110 --> 01:10:06.820
I've tried one.
Um,

1308
01:10:06.910 --> 01:10:11.290
if it's hard to sleep because you're pumping it up so it gets hot in there for

1309
01:10:11.291 --> 01:10:15.220
one,
plus you start thinking like that scene in psycho with a fucking shower

1310
01:10:16.650 --> 01:10:21.370
surrounded my shower curtain.
Just have nightmares and shit every day.
But no,
uh,

1311
01:10:21.740 --> 01:10:23.640
it's when you're,
when you're not breathing as much oxygen,

1312
01:10:23.700 --> 01:10:26.860
it's just you don't feel recovered and you don't get a restful night's sleep.

1313
01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:30.160
I said,
you know,
I see.
I see what you're saying now.
That totally makes sense.

1314
01:10:30.490 --> 01:10:32.980
Yeah.
You definitely feel the difference.
Um,

1315
01:10:33.460 --> 01:10:36.760
and it totally makes sense that you would be able to train harder at sea level.

1316
01:10:36.940 --> 01:10:40.270
You can push your body to that super far extreme that you wouldn't be able to

1317
01:10:40.271 --> 01:10:45.190
get there,
um,
at altitude.
But it's live it out to two for a few years.

1318
01:10:45.191 --> 01:10:48.370
Doesn't your body totally normalized to that?
Yeah,
but then,
um,

1319
01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:53.080
but I'll be fighting at sea level.
You know,
I,
I don't,
you don't know.
Yeah.

1320
01:10:53.140 --> 01:10:55.060
I don't know enough to be handed.
That's just what I was told.

1321
01:10:55.220 --> 01:10:57.950
<v 1>I know I need,
no matter where I'd fight.
Sorry.
Ninja.
Yeah,
you're good.</v>

1322
01:10:57.951 --> 01:11:01.280
I knew no matter where I fought that I would always be ready to go because I was

1323
01:11:01.281 --> 01:11:03.650
born and raised in Colorado,
so I didn't care where it was.

1324
01:11:03.651 --> 01:11:07.230
And one of my goals was to get tired cause I knew if I was tired that that

1325
01:11:07.231 --> 01:11:09.530
motherfucker was dead tired.
So let's go.

1326
01:11:09.690 --> 01:11:13.620
<v 2>Mm guys like Colivida make my head hurt.
Dude,</v>

1327
01:11:13.890 --> 01:11:16.800
he's awesome about thinking about all these different things that he's got.

1328
01:11:16.830 --> 01:11:18.210
You go on and thinking about all his,

1329
01:11:18.580 --> 01:11:21.600
the planning that must be involved with full time jobs.

1330
01:11:21.800 --> 01:11:25.260
It's a straight up full time job.
Like even like the juicing I do every day.

1331
01:11:25.650 --> 01:11:26.230
I mean if I,

1332
01:11:26.230 --> 01:11:30.090
if he didn't do my meal prep it'd be impossible unless obviously my wife was

1333
01:11:30.091 --> 01:11:33.210
doing it all.
Um,
it'd be impossible to get all that done.
You know,

1334
01:11:33.211 --> 01:11:37.140
they're doing it.
It's so much.
And how many athletes is he working with?

1335
01:11:38.310 --> 01:11:39.540
It's a pretty small group.
I mean,

1336
01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:43.020
and is growing now because obviously the name is growing and more athletes that

1337
01:11:43.021 --> 01:11:45.900
were getting along those garage.
Yeah,
it's called the girl.

1338
01:11:45.901 --> 01:11:47.370
We do it at the gym as well too,

1339
01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:51.470
but there's a small group of guys that still go to his garage and do it there.

1340
01:11:51.470 --> 01:11:55.950
It's kind of like our,
our varsity team I guess you'd say,
you know.
Um,
once you,

1341
01:11:55.951 --> 01:11:57.570
once you've proved yourself enough in the gym,

1342
01:11:57.571 --> 01:12:00.060
you can get with that switch is happening.
Guys have come to our gym,

1343
01:12:00.061 --> 01:12:04.640
they've worked out with us,
we've got along with them.
They become like,
you know,

1344
01:12:04.740 --> 01:12:09.720
family and then we bring them into the garage.
Um,
so I'd say he's got c cub one,

1345
01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:15.000
Aaron Peko Saiad um,
just by,

1346
01:12:15.300 --> 01:12:15.631
I don't know,

1347
01:12:15.631 --> 01:12:19.860
I would say we're probably got like a nine guys will come to his garage and

1348
01:12:19.900 --> 01:12:23.370
workout.
That's a great group right there.
Have an Aaron Peko will be,

1349
01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:26.280
that's got to help that teacher world champion.
And without a doubt,

1350
01:12:26.281 --> 01:12:29.610
for sure the savage,
not only like how good he is technically,

1351
01:12:29.611 --> 01:12:33.960
but mentally to like do that fools.
I'm competitive.
I go hard.

1352
01:12:34.410 --> 01:12:37.790
And he's to another extreme.
Like,
dude,
it's,

1353
01:12:38.550 --> 01:12:42.930
we do this at Camp pedaler for distance at the garage.
We're on a down,
um,

1354
01:12:43.050 --> 01:12:43.591
a decline.

1355
01:12:43.591 --> 01:12:47.550
So our were downhill and we're doing his hand pedalers for distance and how far

1356
01:12:47.551 --> 01:12:49.770
we can get.
Who gets it?
Who gets to a mile first wins.

1357
01:12:50.280 --> 01:12:53.830
And I thought he won the world title when you beat me.
She stood up like,
yeah,

1358
01:12:53.831 --> 01:12:57.990
like,
yeah,
like pretty much what I did to Cody yelled in my face after the fight,

1359
01:12:57.991 --> 01:13:01.980
you know,
like,
or after the ham had others that he won.
He,
he's just,

1360
01:13:01.981 --> 01:13:05.610
he's very competitive.
He's very good.
Technically he's hungry.

1361
01:13:05.940 --> 01:13:10.110
He takes no short case.
21 years,
21 years old and wasn't taking any shortcuts.

1362
01:13:10.410 --> 01:13:13.530
I didn't learn all this shit until I was 30 and he's already doing it now.

1363
01:13:13.531 --> 01:13:16.920
And he's a world class wrestler.
Um,

1364
01:13:16.980 --> 01:13:21.120
great boxers working with Freddie Roach a lot.
Um,
he's good man.
He's really good.

1365
01:13:21.390 --> 01:13:23.910
Yeah.
And you know,
I think there's a,

1366
01:13:24.390 --> 01:13:28.080
there's an actual real gift in losing his first fight.
Yeah.

1367
01:13:28.190 --> 01:13:32.790
I think there's a gift in that you learn much hype behind him and he got cracked

1368
01:13:32.791 --> 01:13:34.200
and submitted quick.

1369
01:13:34.280 --> 01:13:37.500
Hebrews got finished as the worst you could possibly get worst.

1370
01:13:38.070 --> 01:13:42.260
And it's very first fight in a head kick.
I don't really recover.

1371
01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:45.210
Only did you get knocked out,
but you got submitted as well and you did.

1372
01:13:45.510 --> 01:13:49.380
And you did it in front of Madison Square Garden on the main card for your first

1373
01:13:49.381 --> 01:13:50.970
fight ever.
So he experienced,

1374
01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.160
experienced like the lowest lows for his first fight.

1375
01:13:53.161 --> 01:13:55.770
So now it's like there's no going low or like everything's,

1376
01:13:56.010 --> 01:14:00.210
everything's skyrocketing now and everybody was so hyped up about them.

1377
01:14:00.211 --> 01:14:02.640
There was so much hype about them,
which is deserved,

1378
01:14:02.670 --> 01:14:06.630
but it just shows you that everybody can get caught,
anybody can get finished.

1379
01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:10.740
And that experience I think is so valuable for him.
Yeah,
I really do.
And that,

1380
01:14:10.770 --> 01:14:12.170
that left hook that he landed

1381
01:14:12.190 --> 01:14:15.460
<v 3>in his last fight.
Holy Shit.
Two fights.
Huh?</v>

1382
01:14:15.930 --> 01:14:18.820
My body nasty murders.

1383
01:14:19.240 --> 01:14:22.390
He'll find that body shot every time.
Respiring she's like,

1384
01:14:22.420 --> 01:14:24.130
obviously you got to get ready for it and you can feel it,

1385
01:14:24.131 --> 01:14:26.530
but he finds it every time.
Yeah.

1386
01:14:26.531 --> 01:14:29.980
You gotta be ready and then like you start worrying about the body shot and

1387
01:14:29.981 --> 01:14:33.820
you're opening yourself up,
you know,
so yeah.
Yeah.
He's,
he's good man.

1388
01:14:33.821 --> 01:14:34.600
He's really good.

1389
01:14:34.600 --> 01:14:37.390
That's one thing I was filling Mr Coker of Bella toward does pretty well is

1390
01:14:37.870 --> 01:14:40.360
gives people the proper fights and help build them up.
Right.

1391
01:14:40.780 --> 01:14:43.750
I don't think people's first fight with a bad matchup,
he just got caught.

1392
01:14:43.810 --> 01:14:48.250
You got caught and caught by a tough guy.
Yeah.
Um,
you know,
I love coker.

1393
01:14:49.050 --> 01:14:50.260
I like what he's doing and you know,

1394
01:14:50.261 --> 01:14:53.440
I'm supposed to be somehow or another and competitive competition with bell
tour.

1395
01:14:53.920 --> 01:14:56.590
I said it's horseshit.
I mean,
I'm the one who got Jimmy Smith hired.

1396
01:14:56.591 --> 01:14:58.960
I was trying to get them hired years ago.
I uh,

1397
01:14:58.990 --> 01:15:02.310
and I love the fact that big Johns over there now and that uh,
you know,

1398
01:15:02.520 --> 01:15:06.430
Gold Goldie's over there too and moral.
I love moral and I just,

1399
01:15:06.460 --> 01:15:08.590
there's a lot of great fighters over there,
man.
I mean,

1400
01:15:08.650 --> 01:15:11.440
I love the fact that Rory Mcdonald's over there,
that he's a champ.

1401
01:15:11.590 --> 01:15:15.070
I mean he's one of the,
if he's not the best welterweight in the world,

1402
01:15:15.071 --> 01:15:17.830
it's him and Tyron,
you know,
I really think that,

1403
01:15:17.890 --> 01:15:20.200
I really think I got to practice that name.
Sorry.
Tiring.

1404
01:15:20.230 --> 01:15:23.680
Just don't have any on the and there sir.
I'm on it.
But if it's not,

1405
01:15:23.800 --> 01:15:26.380
I mean he's most certainly one of the best moves.
Saucy,

1406
01:15:26.381 --> 01:15:28.780
one of the best one 85 ers in the world,
if not the best.

1407
01:15:29.140 --> 01:15:32.980
I mean they have like legit claim to world class fighters now and at least two

1408
01:15:32.981 --> 01:15:35.980
weight classes.
They got the banners,
the fighter walk out.

1409
01:15:35.981 --> 01:15:39.340
It's like an old school.
UFC.
I like it.
I like it.
I like um,

1410
01:15:39.370 --> 01:15:41.340
you know that the fighters are having a good time over there.

1411
01:15:41.350 --> 01:15:44.770
They getting paid well I don't hear any complaints.
Yeah,
I want it to grow man.

1412
01:15:44.771 --> 01:15:47.620
I really want it to be,
I want it to be like right up there with the UFC.

1413
01:15:47.621 --> 01:15:51.700
I would love it if it was a full rival.
Like pride wise.
Yes man.
Ms Proud.

1414
01:15:51.701 --> 01:15:54.730
I left pride.
I didn't figure out a way to do that.
Crossover fights.
He can stay,

1415
01:15:55.120 --> 01:15:56.200
he could stay in Belgium,
jar bill,

1416
01:15:56.201 --> 01:15:59.380
Bill trip as far as UC is and then have like this like oh yeah we're fucking

1417
01:15:59.381 --> 01:16:02.430
better.
And those are big fights.
Canelo triple G.
Yes.

1418
01:16:02.680 --> 01:16:05.980
Look if they had a Floyd Mayweather versus Conor McGregor MMA style,

1419
01:16:06.250 --> 01:16:09.370
if there was like literally a guys bill talks about that.
Right?

1420
01:16:09.400 --> 01:16:12.310
Well there were talks about that for Floyd and Connor but I don't think it was

1421
01:16:12.311 --> 01:16:12.720
real.

1422
01:16:12.720 --> 01:16:16.990
What I mean is a guy who gets as big as Mayweather has gotten in the UFC and the

1423
01:16:16.991 --> 01:16:21.790
guy who gets his big as he got in MMA with belter and then they have some giant

1424
01:16:21.791 --> 01:16:24.100
ass fucking Superfight.
There's enough for everybody.
Yeah.

1425
01:16:24.400 --> 01:16:27.970
I just think for the athletes it's better if there's choices,
you know and it's,

1426
01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.280
it's good for you.
It's not just choices,

1427
01:16:30.281 --> 01:16:34.180
it's more competitive and when it's more competitive they try harder to do a

1428
01:16:34.181 --> 01:16:36.970
good job for the athletes.
Make it attractive to the athletes.

1429
01:16:37.240 --> 01:16:39.730
Like if you're a football player you can get,

1430
01:16:39.880 --> 01:16:43.960
you can go to a bunch of different places to play,
right.
But if you're a fighter,

1431
01:16:44.080 --> 01:16:47.790
you got like two spots,
you got bell tour and it got the UFC,
it starts,

1432
01:16:47.800 --> 01:16:51.220
it's like there's two teams out there and I think that's unfortunate.

1433
01:16:51.280 --> 01:16:52.960
I think it'd be way better for fighters.

1434
01:16:53.410 --> 01:16:56.680
I don't think that boxing is a clean system and I think boxing definitely has

1435
01:16:56.681 --> 01:17:00.190
its flaws in terms of like promotion and how fighters,

1436
01:17:00.640 --> 01:17:03.670
this is why this fights have happened in my triple g and Canelo when it should

1437
01:17:03.671 --> 01:17:05.380
already been over like triple g won that fight.

1438
01:17:05.590 --> 01:17:09.230
But that could happen in the UFC and does judging happens all the time.

1439
01:17:09.260 --> 01:17:13.550
There's some fucking terrible justice out there.
Yeah.
I mean we experienced that.

1440
01:17:13.970 --> 01:17:17.840
Fuck.
It's crazy man.
It's crazy that no one is doing anything to fix it.

1441
01:17:17.990 --> 01:17:22.070
There's people that have passed bad calls that should just be removed.
Yeah.

1442
01:17:22.190 --> 01:17:24.830
So you don't understand professional high level fighting.

1443
01:17:24.880 --> 01:17:28.040
They're just be like a grading system.
Like if you see these judges and they can,

1444
01:17:28.090 --> 01:17:28.911
they've made like,
look,

1445
01:17:28.911 --> 01:17:32.090
this person's made like for bad choices for bad decisions.
Right.
You're out.

1446
01:17:32.120 --> 01:17:35.930
I think they should go through a training course and be tested on it.

1447
01:17:35.931 --> 01:17:38.180
Just like I test my students for their making in the system.
Right.

1448
01:17:38.181 --> 01:17:41.140
They should be able to go through this information and get better and and under

1449
01:17:41.150 --> 01:17:42.830
and pass the test or not judge to the fight.

1450
01:17:42.950 --> 01:17:46.760
Or let a fight go through and let some quality judges judge it and then test

1451
01:17:46.761 --> 01:17:48.380
those results versus their results.
Right.

1452
01:17:48.381 --> 01:17:50.270
How do they judge it and compare those notes to see,

1453
01:17:50.480 --> 01:17:53.660
cause we're dealing with people's careers and their livelihood and lots on the

1454
01:17:53.661 --> 01:17:56.870
line with these people aren't making the correct decisions from their lack of

1455
01:17:56.871 --> 01:18:00.160
education.
They could definitely get better at.
So hopefully they start brewing.

1456
01:18:00.290 --> 01:18:01.420
Sorry.
Oh No,
please go.

1457
01:18:01.460 --> 01:18:04.820
When they start pointing some old fighters and old m maybe spiders retired

1458
01:18:04.821 --> 01:18:08.560
fighters as far as being the judges,
but then maybe there's some,
some uh,

1459
01:18:09.050 --> 01:18:13.520
hold back on that from what would you think?
A biased.
Yeah,
totally.

1460
01:18:13.521 --> 01:18:14.331
That's possible.

1461
01:18:14.331 --> 01:18:19.100
But I think you're better off with those fighters and their bias than someone

1462
01:18:19.101 --> 01:18:22.110
who really doesn't understand cause there'll be afraid of being called out to if

1463
01:18:22.111 --> 01:18:26.620
you can use usually like see their,
their decisions they're making like no,

1464
01:18:26.880 --> 01:18:30.590
just don't have them judge someone who they have a close relationship was her.

1465
01:18:30.830 --> 01:18:34.840
Right.
If like Frankie Edgar is fighting,
you don't have a car all made as a joke.

1466
01:18:34.970 --> 01:18:36.990
Oh yeah,
that's right.
Yeah.
Cause he's a part of the commission.
That's right.

1467
01:18:37.400 --> 01:18:40.790
Even though I think Ricardo was awesome,
the team,

1468
01:18:40.820 --> 01:18:44.420
you need people that understand martial arts and a lot of the people that are

1469
01:18:44.421 --> 01:18:48.530
judges that just have no background,
which to me is crazy.
Agreed.

1470
01:18:48.680 --> 01:18:49.950
It just doesn't make any sense when the,

1471
01:18:49.960 --> 01:18:53.390
it's not like there's a shortage of martial arts practitioners out there.

1472
01:18:53.780 --> 01:18:57.140
There's millions of us were out there.

1473
01:18:57.470 --> 01:19:00.990
You could find us and you could get us to be judges objects from fights.
Yeah,

1474
01:19:01.020 --> 01:19:04.880
there you go man.
I mean and,
and I think also we've said this before,

1475
01:19:04.881 --> 01:19:06.710
I'll say it again,
it should be more than three judges.

1476
01:19:06.870 --> 01:19:08.420
There's no reason to limit it to three.

1477
01:19:08.630 --> 01:19:12.060
All you need is two dummies and they ruin a fighter's career.
You know,

1478
01:19:12.110 --> 01:19:16.580
you could get bad luck and have two dummies out of three.
That's not hard to do.

1479
01:19:16.850 --> 01:19:19.400
Two people really don't understand the fight you,

1480
01:19:19.401 --> 01:19:23.480
you need at least five and I think we'd be fine with 10 I don't think there'd be

1481
01:19:23.481 --> 01:19:26.810
anything wrong with having 10 judges that way.
If you really got to five,
five,

1482
01:19:26.811 --> 01:19:29.810
that's a real draw.
And I think real draws are real too.

1483
01:19:30.090 --> 01:19:32.330
Like there's fights where like you go,
Jesus,

1484
01:19:32.720 --> 01:19:34.410
I don't know who won that fight I got,

1485
01:19:34.490 --> 01:19:38.450
I'd have to go over that fight with a fine tooth comb.
And the difference,

1486
01:19:38.451 --> 01:19:42.030
the distance between winning and losing is so close.
I think you're,

1487
01:19:42.031 --> 01:19:44.570
you're better off arguing for a draw in some fights.

1488
01:19:44.750 --> 01:19:47.970
I don't think there's any shame in that.
Yeah,
I agree 100% I mean,

1489
01:19:47.971 --> 01:19:50.660
if actually it was that close,
like why not it be it,
you know?
Yeah.

1490
01:19:50.661 --> 01:19:53.360
Because there's some fights where the guy gets a decision or the girl gets a

1491
01:19:53.361 --> 01:19:57.350
decision.
You're like,
how by who?
They both won.
I mean,

1492
01:19:57.351 --> 01:20:00.080
there's a fucking incredible fight.
One person goes home,
a loser,

1493
01:20:00.240 --> 01:20:01.460
the other person goes home a winner.

1494
01:20:01.580 --> 01:20:04.910
And it's almost like flipping a coin over time.
When I used to lose,

1495
01:20:05.420 --> 01:20:08.000
when I said draw over time,
Gloria does that still.

1496
01:20:08.030 --> 01:20:13.030
I would just say I came in second place and I tried to ease it a little bit.

1497
01:20:13.080 --> 01:20:16.920
Glory does still the one more round.
That's right.
Yeah.

1498
01:20:17.670 --> 01:20:20.790
I think that'd be cool.
Shit.
That was the one fucking wild.

1499
01:20:22.170 --> 01:20:25.320
Now it's like,
who I fucking won this one?
You know like,
Oh fuck,

1500
01:20:25.321 --> 01:20:29.760
we got another round.
Right.
Let's do this split decision.
I go,

1501
01:20:29.761 --> 01:20:33.900
Jesus,
we have a majority draw.
You're like,
oh no.

1502
01:20:34.830 --> 01:20:39.060
Audience would go nuts if you had that only for championships.
Yeah.

1503
01:20:39.450 --> 01:20:42.930
Only for championships.
One more round.
Yeah,
that'd be cool man.

1504
01:20:43.380 --> 01:20:47.230
People just start pounding on the ground and she'd be like a 10 minute round.

1505
01:20:47.231 --> 01:20:50.970
It should be a 10 minute round.
Two Oh fried style.
Pride style.

1506
01:20:50.971 --> 01:20:54.230
10 minute around was awesome for grapplers and the gloves to,
yeah.

1507
01:20:55.780 --> 01:20:57.360
Yeah.
You think that's a big factor,
right?

1508
01:20:57.361 --> 01:20:59.550
The curve of the gloves and I'm my boxing coach.

1509
01:20:59.550 --> 01:21:02.870
Trevor Whitman is working on some kind of gloves that are eliminating the IPOs

1510
01:21:02.871 --> 01:21:05.520
situation.
I'm not quite sure exactly what he's thinking,
but he,

1511
01:21:05.550 --> 01:21:10.410
if there's anybody to do that job,
it's him.
I love that dude.
He,
he is.

1512
01:21:10.411 --> 01:21:14.520
He is.
Why I'm as technical as I am is from Trevor Whitman.
He's very detailed.

1513
01:21:15.090 --> 01:21:15.920
One of the things that,

1514
01:21:15.920 --> 01:21:20.920
that a lot of people were like almost like wondering or down on him or trying

1515
01:21:21.181 --> 01:21:24.450
to,
looking for something to criticize.
It wasn't just engaging,
knocked out.

1516
01:21:24.451 --> 01:21:28.290
James Vick cracks up,
drops some,
smash them,
stops him.

1517
01:21:28.500 --> 01:21:31.530
Everyone is going crazy and look at Trevor Trevor just sitting there like this,

1518
01:21:31.531 --> 01:21:34.830
but he knows.
Yeah,
I mean he,
he didn't jump up and scream.

1519
01:21:35.130 --> 01:21:38.220
He's had his arms crossed and he's what you see if you can find that so you get

1520
01:21:38.221 --> 01:21:40.480
it.
Can you try to get back at it?
It's kind of ignited to,

1521
01:21:40.650 --> 01:21:44.910
not only do you expect it,
he was like quietly satisfied.
I was like,

1522
01:21:44.911 --> 01:21:48.630
look at that Tyron,
after his title,
he was like,
hmm.

1523
01:21:48.720 --> 01:21:53.540
Sorta just Whitley cried when he got his black belt.
That was crazy.

1524
01:21:53.550 --> 01:21:56.630
Thomas to fell a fighter like that.
That's awesome.
It's cool.

1525
01:21:58.630 --> 01:22:01.410
That felt more to him than win.
That's so crazy.

1526
01:22:01.620 --> 01:22:05.370
The Dow would feel more to him then then defending his title.

1527
01:22:05.490 --> 01:22:08.670
He's been real champion,
nosy world champ.
He's confident,
you know,

1528
01:22:08.730 --> 01:22:11.750
without a doubt.
One of the best welterweights of all times.
Without a doubt.
He's,

1529
01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:14.100
I feel like there's three guys in the running.
It's Matt Hughes,

1530
01:22:14.101 --> 01:22:18.550
George Saint Pierre and him.
He's so athletic,
man.
So good.
It's crazy authentic.

1531
01:22:18.690 --> 01:22:19.080
He is.

1532
01:22:19.080 --> 01:22:24.080
And with den with Dean and his corner and with Duke Roufus and just,

1533
01:22:24.151 --> 01:22:26.100
he's just coming into his own man.
You know,

1534
01:22:26.101 --> 01:22:30.660
he mean and people criticized him for the Damien Maia fight and the Wonderboy

1535
01:22:30.660 --> 01:22:32.610
Thompson fight.
But because those fights was boring,

1536
01:22:32.760 --> 01:22:36.630
that's the way you have to fight those guys period.

1537
01:22:36.631 --> 01:22:40.470
If you want to fight Wonderboy,
you think you get to go crazy and charge at him.

1538
01:22:40.471 --> 01:22:42.770
Good luck and good idea.
Yeah.

1539
01:22:42.780 --> 01:22:45.840
You're going to eat some knuckles to going back to the training method,
you know,

1540
01:22:45.841 --> 01:22:49.430
and that's one thing.
I wonder how much time it Duke is spending with him and,

1541
01:22:49.440 --> 01:22:53.550
and dean spending without Din Din Thomas Dennis spending with them and then

1542
01:22:53.970 --> 01:22:56.850
taking that skill and testing it against all the other att guys.

1543
01:22:56.851 --> 01:23:00.630
So I'm just wondering how much classwork is doing versus one on one work and

1544
01:23:00.631 --> 01:23:03.450
then how much live work is getting with the crew.
That's actually a question.

1545
01:23:03.451 --> 01:23:07.450
I don't think they're doing too much work att because atts where Colby is right

1546
01:23:07.451 --> 01:23:08.760
now.
So what?
Where's he now?

1547
01:23:08.770 --> 01:23:11.250
He's training that is that seem a lot of it at Duke roof.
Okay.

1548
01:23:11.330 --> 01:23:12.460
Spend a lot of time with Duke,

1549
01:23:12.461 --> 01:23:17.380
but I don't know exactly where he trained his whole camp.
You know,
he was at,

1550
01:23:17.440 --> 01:23:21.280
uh,
at Duke.
He was at Duke,
so yeah.
Good.
Well he looks fucking phenomenal.

1551
01:23:21.281 --> 01:23:26.281
Duke's figured out a way to get him to really conserve his energy and manage it

1552
01:23:26.351 --> 01:23:27.190
properly too,

1553
01:23:27.400 --> 01:23:32.400
because we all know that when someone's that big and that it's so hard to

1554
01:23:32.951 --> 01:23:33.850
maintain a durance,

1555
01:23:33.851 --> 01:23:38.520
but he hurt Wonderboy in the fourth round of their fight and hurt him bad.

1556
01:23:38.521 --> 01:23:41.710
Like he carries that knockout power deep,
deep into the fight.

1557
01:23:42.010 --> 01:23:45.370
So he's figured it out.
He's figured out a way to manage his energy correctly.

1558
01:23:45.371 --> 01:23:47.230
And if you see the countdown shows too,

1559
01:23:47.231 --> 01:23:50.080
he's doing a bunch of crazy crap strength and conditioning shit too,

1560
01:23:50.200 --> 01:23:54.760
which I kind of think everybody has to do now.
Right.
That's even,
that's a real,

1561
01:23:54.761 --> 01:23:58.540
we're going to ESPN.
It's a real fucking sport.
You know,
you can't take shortcuts,

1562
01:23:58.541 --> 01:24:00.100
man.
This is a professional,
like I told you,

1563
01:24:00.101 --> 01:24:01.720
my training schedule is a full time job.

1564
01:24:02.050 --> 01:24:04.390
It's hard for me to get anything else done when I'm in training camp.

1565
01:24:04.690 --> 01:24:07.180
Now when you're not training camp,
like now you're out of camp,

1566
01:24:07.181 --> 01:24:09.330
how many days a week you working out?
Um,

1567
01:24:09.820 --> 01:24:12.580
lately I've only been doing like my string conditioning with Sam.

1568
01:24:12.581 --> 01:24:16.030
So when I'm back in town a couple of times a week,
um,

1569
01:24:16.150 --> 01:24:18.850
I'm going to go back out to Colorado and I was spinning everyday at Dwayne's

1570
01:24:18.851 --> 01:24:22.540
doing kickboxing.
Um,
I'll probably go to start going to Gracie Baha,

1571
01:24:22.541 --> 01:24:24.850
send you this is all fun.
Like I'm doing,
I'm doing the normal.

1572
01:24:24.851 --> 01:24:27.400
I'll go to do normal class right now at Sam's.

1573
01:24:27.401 --> 01:24:29.380
It's not like I'm peaking for a fight,

1574
01:24:29.381 --> 01:24:33.010
so it's just maintaining my body and keep them certain things strong to prevent

1575
01:24:33.011 --> 01:24:34.450
injury.
Um,

1576
01:24:34.480 --> 01:24:37.630
and then I'll go to Gracie Baha and I'll probably roll some g just to do it,

1577
01:24:37.660 --> 01:24:41.350
you know,
just to kind of stay active.
When you roll gay,

1578
01:24:41.351 --> 01:24:44.740
do you grab the g or do you trust?
Just try to do Nogi techniques.

1579
01:24:44.890 --> 01:24:46.570
I need to get better at learning how to grab the key.

1580
01:24:46.571 --> 01:24:50.830
I just still do Nogi techniques because that's what I've always do.
You know I,

1581
01:24:50.831 --> 01:24:55.250
I'm never did.
I would never really use the gay.
I hardly ever use it.

1582
01:24:55.251 --> 01:24:57.930
It's not my favorite,
but I wear it but I don't use it.
Yeah.

1583
01:24:57.940 --> 01:25:00.490
I just do know [inaudible] with the Guiana and they'd grab me,

1584
01:25:00.850 --> 01:25:04.000
but I just do know geese stuff.
Yeah.
That's why I got to go in there for fun.

1585
01:25:04.001 --> 01:25:06.850
You can't go in there and like expecting to be great because there's so much

1586
01:25:06.851 --> 01:25:08.620
shit.
If you don't know it,
they're grabbing your belt,

1587
01:25:08.621 --> 01:25:11.320
pulling you in certain colleges and crazy shit that they deal.
They pull your,

1588
01:25:11.370 --> 01:25:15.160
your thing out at your lapels out,
tried to choke you with it.

1589
01:25:16.090 --> 01:25:19.350
They'll pull the back of your geek out,
wrap it around your neck.
Right arm,

1590
01:25:19.370 --> 01:25:22.870
right settle down.
But it mean for the geek competition,

1591
01:25:22.900 --> 01:25:24.370
as long as that's all legal,
that's great.

1592
01:25:24.371 --> 01:25:28.000
But I mean for someone learning martial arts,

1593
01:25:28.090 --> 01:25:30.610
whether it's for self defense or for me,

1594
01:25:30.640 --> 01:25:35.620
what I found about doing g is it really improved my Nogi submission defense

1595
01:25:35.920 --> 01:25:38.200
because it was so easy to control me with the gate.

1596
01:25:38.410 --> 01:25:41.770
Cause if someone's grabbing your collar and grammy your sleeve and they bang

1597
01:25:41.800 --> 01:25:44.980
their hold you down,
you have to get out of things.
Technically.

1598
01:25:44.981 --> 01:25:48.640
Like if you get locked up in an arm bar,
you can't just explode out of things.

1599
01:25:48.790 --> 01:25:51.130
You have to figure out a way to like slowly,

1600
01:25:51.160 --> 01:25:55.930
incrementally release yourself the right way and defend everything the right
way.

1601
01:25:55.930 --> 01:25:58.780
Because if you get too deep with all that friction with the,

1602
01:25:58.781 --> 01:26:02.870
you know that heavy canvas,
he,
they can lock you up.
You know,
I,

1603
01:26:02.910 --> 01:26:05.240
we to be technical and your defense really,

1604
01:26:05.390 --> 01:26:07.900
it makes you too much more meticulous about your submission.

1605
01:26:07.920 --> 01:26:11.750
So it doesn't make you like hold.
Yeah,
absolutely.
Especially defense.
Yeah.

1606
01:26:11.900 --> 01:26:14.450
I mean if you're going to compete in Jujitsu then where it Geeky,

1607
01:26:14.451 --> 01:26:18.320
but if it's for self defense,
then I would actually train Nogi I say that.

1608
01:26:18.321 --> 01:26:23.270
But if you're in New York and you wearing a leather coat winter to match what

1609
01:26:23.271 --> 01:26:27.110
Ronda Rousey's due to someone who had a winter coat on soc shit to her with a

1610
01:26:27.111 --> 01:26:30.590
Jean Jacket on,
bitch,
you fly on your head.
Hell yeah.
Hell yeah you are.

1611
01:26:30.650 --> 01:26:32.720
That's who they are.
Rolling with the typical close though.
Right?

1612
01:26:32.721 --> 01:26:35.950
Cause the that's going to be different than an actual but close enough if it's

1613
01:26:35.960 --> 01:26:37.190
enough the grab,

1614
01:26:37.340 --> 01:26:40.880
I mean you know like if your graph you could choke somebody out with a regular

1615
01:26:40.910 --> 01:26:41.743
collared shirt.

1616
01:26:41.870 --> 01:26:45.760
Oh you know you grab a hold of like a regular dress shirt and you get a hand in

1617
01:26:45.780 --> 01:26:48.740
lapel.
That's a dead man and he doesn't even know it.

1618
01:26:48.990 --> 01:26:53.990
Just get ahold of that collar and pull that fucker in a great,

1619
01:26:54.520 --> 01:26:55.760
I mean kind of like you were saying,

1620
01:26:55.940 --> 01:26:59.780
changing who I am because of of where I'm at my life and my family now.

1621
01:27:00.080 --> 01:27:02.780
Like I wish I could train more outside of fight camp.

1622
01:27:02.840 --> 01:27:04.550
I wish I had more time to get in the gym and train.

1623
01:27:04.551 --> 01:27:06.980
But I'm like going everywhere,
getting pulled in every direction,

1624
01:27:06.981 --> 01:27:10.320
creating businesses to try to set up my future.
I know you're,

1625
01:27:10.330 --> 01:27:13.400
you've got your season,
he'd business.
I've used your seasoning.
Yeah.
Flavors,

1626
01:27:13.730 --> 01:27:16.580
flavor republic.
Yeah.
Did you come up with this on your own?
So yes,

1627
01:27:16.581 --> 01:27:19.490
I started it because of my new diet with same cal Vieta you know,

1628
01:27:19.491 --> 01:27:20.660
I had to eat super clean,

1629
01:27:20.661 --> 01:27:25.661
I wanted a low sugar and I wanted something that was low sodium or no sodium so

1630
01:27:25.671 --> 01:27:28.640
that when I'm cutting weight I can still use it.
But we make our own sea salt,

1631
01:27:28.641 --> 01:27:32.150
organic sea salt as well so that we can add it to and we want to,
you know,

1632
01:27:32.151 --> 01:27:34.490
so that I,
because I,
you need sodium,
you need good sodium.

1633
01:27:35.630 --> 01:27:38.930
But when I'm wanting to flush the water I don't,
I don't use it.
So yeah,

1634
01:27:38.931 --> 01:27:42.470
you sent me over a bunch of stuff.
It's great man.
Thank you.
I use a lot of it.

1635
01:27:42.500 --> 01:27:46.070
Yeah.
Seasoned meat with it all the time.
Yeah.
Why just used it last night?
I mean,

1636
01:27:46.730 --> 01:27:49.940
it's not like I'm actually using,
I'm actually into the company and like it,

1637
01:27:49.970 --> 01:27:53.090
you know.
That's cool.
Especially for wild game and things like that.

1638
01:27:53.091 --> 01:27:56.720
It's cool man.
It's really,
really fun.
Do you,
uh,
do you have a pellet grill?

1639
01:27:56.750 --> 01:27:58.880
Do you cook with I do.
I have a trigger.
Those things,

1640
01:27:58.881 --> 01:28:02.450
that shit they sent me one of those,
those bad words,
those bad ass one.

1641
01:28:02.880 --> 01:28:06.290
You want to at timberline,
dude,
you got the meat thermometer.

1642
01:28:06.291 --> 01:28:11.000
Everything with this.
A lot of on that thing.
Best to,
well it's all wood.

1643
01:28:11.001 --> 01:28:13.760
It's natural wood for people to know what a pellet grill is and there's a bunch

1644
01:28:13.761 --> 01:28:16.360
of companies and make real good ones.
Uh,
we have outback,

1645
01:28:16.460 --> 01:28:19.670
we have a Yoder that's really good.
I had a green mountain grill.

1646
01:28:19.671 --> 01:28:23.720
That's a really good company that Green Mountain grills are very affordable too.

1647
01:28:23.930 --> 01:28:26.930
And they come also with a builtin thermometer.
Just like the trigger hounds.
Yeah.

1648
01:28:27.110 --> 01:28:30.980
What'd you do is you,
you pour wood pellets and these pallets are made,

1649
01:28:30.981 --> 01:28:34.040
like if someone makes a table like this,
the natural,

1650
01:28:34.670 --> 01:28:36.740
the saw dust from the,

1651
01:28:36.741 --> 01:28:41.490
an actual table is they just compress it and the natural sugars in the saw dust

1652
01:28:41.630 --> 01:28:44.320
force it to form into these little pellets,

1653
01:28:44.321 --> 01:28:47.510
these like little tubular pellets and you can snap them with your fingers,

1654
01:28:47.690 --> 01:28:48.640
you know,
but they,

1655
01:28:48.670 --> 01:28:53.180
they go through this worm drive onto a heating element and it's just fire and

1656
01:28:53.181 --> 01:28:56.360
wood.
That's all it is.
You're,
you're,
you're cooking your food with fire and wood.

1657
01:28:56.361 --> 01:29:00.470
I mean it's all complicated and electronic and shit and it's all sophisticated

1658
01:29:00.471 --> 01:29:02.280
in an engineered,
but at the end of the day,

1659
01:29:02.280 --> 01:29:06.920
<v 0>the result is fire and wood and the food tastes like fire and wood.</v>

1660
01:29:07.840 --> 01:29:10.500
Great.
That's what they like.
They have different pellets for different tastes.

1661
01:29:10.670 --> 01:29:13.460
You can taste the difference.
Absolutely.
I love pellet grills ma'am.

1662
01:29:13.470 --> 01:29:17.100
She was just such a big fan.
It's such an easy way to cook too.
And that,

1663
01:29:17.220 --> 01:29:20.160
that timberline just maintains its temperature perfectly.

1664
01:29:20.190 --> 01:29:23.970
You could start it with your phone
connected to your phone.

1665
01:29:23.971 --> 01:29:26.370
So if you want to heat it up before you get home,
you can start heating it up.

1666
01:29:26.470 --> 01:29:30.060
[inaudible] they have an APP,
like I was going to cook lobster tail,
so I'm like,

1667
01:29:30.100 --> 01:29:33.690
Ooh,
I don't Cook lobster tails trigger.
Go to the fucking APP.
It tells you,

1668
01:29:33.691 --> 01:29:37.320
it tells you what to have,
what ingredients,
how to do it,
all of it on your phone.

1669
01:29:37.350 --> 01:29:40.950
It's a fucking incredible.
Yeah.
Let's get you in for the house.
I'll take it.

1670
01:29:41.190 --> 01:29:43.900
I have room.
Thank you sir.
So do you didn't get,

1671
01:29:43.980 --> 01:29:47.160
you didn't get an elk tag this year?
Oh Man.
Well I,
I have a,

1672
01:29:47.161 --> 01:29:51.410
I'm going with Chad Mendez,
a four rifle,
but where are you guys going?
Uh,

1673
01:29:51.510 --> 01:29:53.700
Colorado.
Oh,
I don't know exactly the area.

1674
01:29:53.701 --> 01:29:56.200
We're going to something set up through fins and feathers.
His companies as says,

1675
01:29:56.210 --> 01:30:00.300
as a guide service dude,
he's living the life man.
Is he like,

1676
01:30:00.301 --> 01:30:03.510
he even told after his last place,
like I'm not fighting the until next year.

1677
01:30:03.560 --> 01:30:07.320
You know,
it's hunting season my business.
Like,
yeah,
he loves it and he's,

1678
01:30:07.321 --> 01:30:08.154
he's awesome.

1679
01:30:08.190 --> 01:30:11.680
It was nice to see him come back and come back with a beautiful knockout.
Yeah.

1680
01:30:12.900 --> 01:30:16.710
Yeah.
I mean,
I still,
one of my very close friends and so we're doing a hunt here,

1681
01:30:16.740 --> 01:30:21.390
uh,
and end of October for rifle,
but my loves archery.
So yeah.

1682
01:30:21.391 --> 01:30:24.420
I didn't get an archery tag this year for,
for,
for an elk.

1683
01:30:24.630 --> 01:30:29.580
Can you hunt with your bow in,
um,
during rifle season?
I think you can.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1684
01:30:30.740 --> 01:30:32.820
Think about rifle season is though you're dealing with,

1685
01:30:33.120 --> 01:30:35.280
they're not run out and run.
Like right now.

1686
01:30:35.281 --> 01:30:39.900
We had a video of being up in Colorado,
like 20 yards from two big elk fighting.

1687
01:30:40.170 --> 01:30:43.020
They didn't even know,
like I was standing up,
or at least here we're standing up.

1688
01:30:43.021 --> 01:30:46.590
Didn't even know they were there,
you know,
just 20 yards away.
I mean,
that's why,

1689
01:30:46.890 --> 01:30:51.090
that's why you get to do,
uh,
archery during wet season,
you know?
Yeah.
Dude,

1690
01:30:51.091 --> 01:30:54.870
Amo just,
that's,
I live for it.
I love it so much.
It's to me,
it's like,

1691
01:30:55.380 --> 01:30:58.920
it makes me so happy that I have my meat for a year.
Yeah.
You know,

1692
01:30:58.921 --> 01:31:02.460
you shoot an elk,
basically.
I've have meat for you and for all my friends now,

1693
01:31:02.461 --> 01:31:02.791
I've gotten,

1694
01:31:02.791 --> 01:31:06.720
all my friends had like Brian Cowen and all these guys addicted to elk,
Tom Papa.

1695
01:31:06.930 --> 01:31:08.620
I give them pounds of it,
man.

1696
01:31:08.650 --> 01:31:13.320
Just constantly giving them elk sausage and elk steaks and it's like once you

1697
01:31:13.321 --> 01:31:16.890
taste that natural wild meat,
you go,
oh man.

1698
01:31:16.920 --> 01:31:19.530
Like just learning how much healthier it is for you to,
you know.

1699
01:31:19.890 --> 01:31:22.590
Do you feel different when you eat it?
I,
it's all I've ever eaten.

1700
01:31:22.650 --> 01:31:25.050
I grew up that way and so I,
I grew up hunting because my dad,

1701
01:31:25.080 --> 01:31:28.020
my dad's been an archery hunter has a wild man.
I met your dad.
Yeah,

1702
01:31:28.050 --> 01:31:31.060
he could tell right away.
Oh yeah.
I'm like,
okay.
That's where it,

1703
01:31:31.380 --> 01:31:35.220
that's where it all comes from.
My Dad.
Yeah.
He's,
I mean I remember that guy just,

1704
01:31:35.310 --> 01:31:37.800
I mean he's always been the bad state have ever known and he's always just,

1705
01:31:38.390 --> 01:31:39.960
he's game,
he's taking on crazy.

1706
01:31:39.961 --> 01:31:43.650
Huntsville will hike her ass off and go hike 20 miles and,
and work,

1707
01:31:43.651 --> 01:31:46.950
work really hard,
hunt public land.
Like it's never been the easy thing.

1708
01:31:46.951 --> 01:31:48.300
It's always been as hard as we can make it.

1709
01:31:49.070 --> 01:31:52.500
It's made me really like fall in love with hunting even more.

1710
01:31:53.110 --> 01:31:56.970
Those back country Huntsman people are starting to catch on to what an adventure

1711
01:31:56.971 --> 01:32:00.250
that is.
Yeah,
and you know these guys,
like my friend Aaron Schneider

1712
01:32:00.250 --> 01:32:03.460
<v 3>who runs [inaudible],
one of the best backpack companies in the world,</v>

1713
01:32:03.670 --> 01:32:07.570
they make a hunting backpacks and wilderness backpacks and it's like you used to

1714
01:32:07.571 --> 01:32:11.140
be able to go eight miles down the trail head and there'd be nobody.
He goes,

1715
01:32:11.141 --> 01:32:11.681
now you go there,

1716
01:32:11.681 --> 01:32:14.950
there's three tents because other guys are learning how to do this too,

1717
01:32:14.951 --> 01:32:19.450
and they're realizing this exp,
especially high country mule deer,

1718
01:32:19.780 --> 01:32:23.650
which is insanely difficult animal to hunt because there are so switched on

1719
01:32:23.651 --> 01:32:25.270
because every day they're running from mountain lions.

1720
01:32:25.490 --> 01:32:27.310
Every day is like that mountain lion.
Is that a mountain lion?

1721
01:32:27.330 --> 01:32:29.940
What was that branch?
So fucking smart you sketched out there,

1722
01:32:30.030 --> 01:32:33.370
so sketched out when you get to a five year old year,

1723
01:32:33.680 --> 01:32:35.140
which is what everybody wants to shoot,

1724
01:32:35.440 --> 01:32:38.650
well they want to shoot as a four five and older deer.

1725
01:32:38.770 --> 01:32:41.950
You're getting this giant deer.
They're probably 300 pounds.

1726
01:32:42.250 --> 01:32:44.200
They have enormous antlers.
I mean,

1727
01:32:44.360 --> 01:32:49.060
mule deer have these crazy rats all knotted up,
all knotted up crazy.
And they,

1728
01:32:49.210 --> 01:32:52.600
they've been hunted since day one.
Every day of their lives.

1729
01:32:52.630 --> 01:32:54.160
They've been five years.

1730
01:32:54.340 --> 01:32:57.670
It's like a fighter who's been fighting at a championship level five years.

1731
01:32:57.671 --> 01:33:00.460
Like you ain't getting away with no sloppy bullshit with him.
Exactly.

1732
01:33:00.490 --> 01:33:01.760
That's a good way to put it.
Perfect.

1733
01:33:02.410 --> 01:33:05.520
You can't snap on branches and they don't notice you're there.

1734
01:33:05.521 --> 01:33:07.510
They fucking term nocturnal as well.
Yeah.

1735
01:33:07.511 --> 01:33:12.360
Like I went up to five days before opening day and saw three,
two,

1736
01:33:12.370 --> 01:33:14.890
three pointers in a big four point right in the area.
I'm going to go hunt.

1737
01:33:15.250 --> 01:33:18.790
And then 10 days later I go out cause I missed opening day.
But uh,

1738
01:33:19.600 --> 01:33:22.870
I know 10 years ago after they're gone.
Yeah,
they are nocturnal.

1739
01:33:22.871 --> 01:33:26.200
They hide and they just realize that people are after them.
They,
they've,

1740
01:33:26.380 --> 01:33:30.280
they've been doing it so long that hunting season is literally like factored

1741
01:33:30.281 --> 01:33:33.400
into their internal clock DNA.
And they realize that they'll go,

1742
01:33:33.401 --> 01:33:37.030
oh well there's the people.
I know what this is.
Know they go,
I know what this is.

1743
01:33:37.031 --> 01:33:41.230
Time to get the fuck out of here.
Oh eat at two 30 yeah,
they'll get it.

1744
01:33:41.250 --> 01:33:44.380
They'll just,
especially during full moons and things like that,

1745
01:33:44.620 --> 01:33:48.160
it's really interesting man.
It's once you experience these,

1746
01:33:48.400 --> 01:33:50.300
I mean even if you're not into hunting,
but if you do,

1747
01:33:50.370 --> 01:33:54.700
I always advise people just please just go hiking deep into the back country.

1748
01:33:54.701 --> 01:33:56.230
Just take,
take off six,

1749
01:33:56.231 --> 01:34:00.400
seven mile hike deep into the back country and it'll put it in perspective for

1750
01:34:00.401 --> 01:34:02.650
you.
Like those two and a half days I spent in Colorado,

1751
01:34:02.651 --> 01:34:06.430
I hiked probably 20 miles by myself with no one and I didn't get anything.

1752
01:34:06.430 --> 01:34:09.190
I didn't even see an animal.
I found one drop a horn,
Nova,
an elk.

1753
01:34:09.490 --> 01:34:12.460
I didn't see shit,
you know?
And I still loved it.
I still can't.
I was like,

1754
01:34:12.461 --> 01:34:15.220
I'm glad I did it.
You know,
hike my ass off was out there.

1755
01:34:15.221 --> 01:34:17.290
My cell phone didn't work.
It's just when you go out there,

1756
01:34:17.291 --> 01:34:20.490
do you bring a spotting scope?
Yeah.
So you bring a spotting scope.
Yeah.

1757
01:34:20.860 --> 01:34:24.490
Spotting scope by knows the whole range finder.
Yeah,

1758
01:34:24.550 --> 01:34:27.820
I know you looking at Google Earth in advance or I'm looking at,

1759
01:34:27.850 --> 01:34:31.450
Oh what's the APP?
Onyx hunt.
Yes.
He's Onyx Hunt.
Yeah.

1760
01:34:31.451 --> 01:34:33.590
So you kinda like downloads the area,
right?

1761
01:34:33.610 --> 01:34:36.310
So then when you showed your words public where you can even download the APP

1762
01:34:36.311 --> 01:34:38.770
too.
When you don't have service,
you can still use that.
It knows where you're at.

1763
01:34:38.960 --> 01:34:41.900
And you know like if you're on private property,
if you're on public land,

1764
01:34:41.901 --> 01:34:44.460
it like maps everything out for you that way.
So that thing,

1765
01:34:44.500 --> 01:34:45.610
that's an amazing APP.

1766
01:34:45.880 --> 01:34:49.720
But just being able to see the territory and know where the basins are and the

1767
01:34:49.721 --> 01:34:54.290
ridges are holes and get a sense like,
okay,
what time of year is it?
I mean it's,

1768
01:34:54.310 --> 01:34:58.100
it's,
there's,
it's not just going out to get,
there's a,
there's

1769
01:34:58.100 --> 01:35:01.700
<v 2>really like a science to mule deer hunting and what the weather has been like.</v>

1770
01:35:01.701 --> 01:35:03.290
And it's been hot.
They're going to be high country.

1771
01:35:03.291 --> 01:35:05.680
They're going to be really high if it's been hot.
Yeah.
You know,
um,

1772
01:35:06.020 --> 01:35:08.840
you want it to be like overcast and cool.
Silicon.
I'm wondering the day,

1773
01:35:08.841 --> 01:35:10.370
cause they'll bed down when it's hot.

1774
01:35:10.400 --> 01:35:13.360
They bed down all day long and that's why they come to nocturnal as well as the,

1775
01:35:13.790 --> 01:35:18.080
it's cool enough for them to expend energy to go get food to where if you go in

1776
01:35:18.081 --> 01:35:19.280
the middle of the day at 12 o'clock,
you,

1777
01:35:19.281 --> 01:35:24.100
you have to spot them with your by knows laying down and hopefully sneak up on

1778
01:35:24.101 --> 01:35:27.410
him and not let them see you or wait for them to get up and start feeding and

1779
01:35:27.411 --> 01:35:30.470
then sneak up on them.
Now when you go out there,
are you,

1780
01:35:30.620 --> 01:35:34.900
do you have the creeks mapped out or are you hauling in water?
What you,

1781
01:35:34.910 --> 01:35:36.800
how are you getting water?
Um,
I,

1782
01:35:36.801 --> 01:35:40.880
I'll always take those pills with me to build the purified water.

1783
01:35:40.881 --> 01:35:43.260
Purified the wire.
Dining tablets?
Yes.
Iodine tablets.

1784
01:35:43.270 --> 01:35:45.740
You're not supposed to drink too much of that though.
I'm sure you're not,

1785
01:35:45.741 --> 01:35:49.310
but I don't hunt.
Right.
24 seven.
You know what I mean?
Worst case scenario,

1786
01:35:49.311 --> 01:35:52.010
at least I'm not going to go out there and get Gerardia and get lost.

1787
01:35:52.020 --> 01:35:54.500
I can hardly seem to be the purify some water and I have a lighter,

1788
01:35:54.900 --> 01:35:58.820
well I don't have a,
I don't have,
I have a canteen so I would melt.
But anyways,

1789
01:35:58.850 --> 01:36:01.640
uh,
to heat it up,
yeah.
To build a heated up.
But yeah,

1790
01:36:01.641 --> 01:36:02.750
I know where the waterholes are.

1791
01:36:02.780 --> 01:36:06.410
I always know that and I bring enough water for me to drink and then I pack it

1792
01:36:06.411 --> 01:36:07.690
into camp too.
Um,

1793
01:36:07.820 --> 01:36:10.730
luckily this plot and Colorado wasn't very far from where I had to park my
truck,

1794
01:36:10.731 --> 01:36:15.550
so I was able to drive in a bunch of water.
Oh,
that's cool.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's um,

1795
01:36:15.980 --> 01:36:17.970
but my dad though we hiked back in the room,

1796
01:36:17.971 --> 01:36:21.740
he's like 20 miles and then hunt back there.
Hopefully not finding anybody.

1797
01:36:21.741 --> 01:36:24.860
And like he said,
you still find people.
Um,
but yeah,

1798
01:36:24.861 --> 01:36:28.910
we have to bring the iodine pills or we have a pump and then we obviously we

1799
01:36:28.911 --> 01:36:32.480
packed in pots and we boil it and drink.
Usually we use,

1800
01:36:32.540 --> 01:36:33.830
usually we boil it back at camp,

1801
01:36:33.831 --> 01:36:35.570
but if you're out and about and you only have a canteen on it,

1802
01:36:35.571 --> 01:36:36.710
you'll fill it out,
throw it Ilm.

1803
01:36:36.711 --> 01:36:40.750
Peeling it and shake it around and 10 minutes later he got clean water.
Yeah.

1804
01:36:40.751 --> 01:36:44.620
You don't want any to beaver fever?
No.
Hell No.
Especially being at 20 months,

1805
01:36:45.050 --> 01:36:49.340
20 miles out bad,
that would suck.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

1806
01:36:49.640 --> 01:36:52.380
It's um,
it's beautiful country though,
man.
I mean to,

1807
01:36:52.450 --> 01:36:54.770
to be able to go out there and to that back country,
Colorado,

1808
01:36:54.771 --> 01:36:58.160
Colorado where there's no,
people just realize it doesn't even look real.

1809
01:36:58.161 --> 01:37:01.340
It looks like,
you know,
find like a mountain lake up there.
They're like,

1810
01:37:01.341 --> 01:37:05.960
this isn't even real.
It's kind of a real estate.
Beautiful pictures you take.

1811
01:37:05.961 --> 01:37:09.250
Don't look like you.
Like you just come off the Internet.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1812
01:37:09.770 --> 01:37:11.300
That sounds near you,
man.
I mean,
sure

1813
01:37:11.390 --> 01:37:15.630
<v 1>you picked,
I don't ever hunt though.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I need it to do you.
I'm sure I,</v>

1814
01:37:15.660 --> 01:37:17.760
yeah,
I,
yeah.
I have asked him some of the stakes at the,

1815
01:37:17.761 --> 01:37:20.550
his house for the last camp actually,
so yeah,

1816
01:37:20.560 --> 01:37:24.540
we got this from the Kingston coffee.
Gary Mark also.
Yeah,
we have both.
Okay.

1817
01:37:24.800 --> 01:37:26.310
What kind of Diet do you fall?

1818
01:37:26.640 --> 01:37:28.620
I have actually when I'm out in California with him,

1819
01:37:28.820 --> 01:37:31.530
a Sam's family makes me the same meals.
Why not the same?

1820
01:37:31.590 --> 01:37:33.870
I don't know if the exact pretty much the same,
but the,

1821
01:37:33.871 --> 01:37:36.510
I eat the same meals as him and I usually eat pretty clean too.

1822
01:37:36.511 --> 01:37:38.490
When I did my hair analysis with the Sam,

1823
01:37:38.690 --> 01:37:40.980
my all my levels and stuff came back pretty good.

1824
01:37:40.981 --> 01:37:44.520
I was pretty pretty baseline or healthy for the most part.

1825
01:37:44.580 --> 01:37:48.130
Are you training or just training people?
Do you train yourself?
Train.

1826
01:37:48.160 --> 01:37:50.400
I stay sharp.
You know,
I've got to lead by example and,
and I love it.

1827
01:37:50.430 --> 01:37:52.490
So it's just what I've done since I was eight,
you know,

1828
01:37:52.500 --> 01:37:54.960
starting with the [inaudible] karate and just been on it since.

1829
01:37:55.200 --> 01:37:57.780
So then when he comes out the training lab and throws the gear and a holds Mitts

1830
01:37:57.781 --> 01:38:01.980
for me,
cub won like he just did like three hours of holding Mitts,
you know,

1831
01:38:01.981 --> 01:38:05.340
like he's getting a workout dude and that shit.
Just the impact and move it down.

1832
01:38:05.341 --> 01:38:07.910
Of course.
I don't just stand there either,
right guy.

1833
01:38:08.080 --> 01:38:11.280
I've got to give them the feel and the reactions and throwback and I get to play

1834
01:38:11.281 --> 01:38:12.031
UFC a little bit.

1835
01:38:12.031 --> 01:38:15.330
I thought getting beat up so it's fun to still again live vicariously through

1836
01:38:15.331 --> 01:38:18.570
these guys.
But uh,
I still definitely do train and again,

1837
01:38:18.571 --> 01:38:19.950
lead by example and stay sharp.

1838
01:38:20.520 --> 01:38:23.340
<v 2>Have you ever thought about one day?
I mean you,</v>

1839
01:38:23.341 --> 01:38:28.341
you're in a weird situation where you could potentially go to 45 and you could

1840
01:38:28.651 --> 01:38:32.690
potentially go to 25 when you could be champ,
champ,
champ.
My coach already.

1841
01:38:32.700 --> 01:38:35.130
Like when I first started working out with Sam and I was fighting go to the

1842
01:38:35.131 --> 01:38:37.670
first time,
he's like,
I'm gonna make you a three division champ.
It's like,

1843
01:38:37.680 --> 01:38:39.600
that's our goal.
Why don't you be the first one ever to do it?

1844
01:38:39.660 --> 01:38:41.550
He's always like reaching for the,
you know,
everything.

1845
01:38:41.620 --> 01:38:45.600
And the way I know I can do it too is because I can pack the weight on it with

1846
01:38:45.601 --> 01:38:46.434
him too.

1847
01:38:46.830 --> 01:38:50.400
I've gotten up to one 58 pretty solid before I went down to 35 is the first time

1848
01:38:50.790 --> 01:38:51.630
Max Holloway,

1849
01:38:51.631 --> 01:38:55.950
who is UFC 145 pound champion is a fucking big guy.

1850
01:38:56.010 --> 01:38:59.460
I don't think so big.
Eventually he's probably three a 50 fiver.
Yeah.

1851
01:38:59.490 --> 01:39:01.320
I don't know how he does it.
When,

1852
01:39:01.470 --> 01:39:05.940
when they had a medically stop him from cutting weight to make 55 when he's a 45

1853
01:39:05.941 --> 01:39:10.200
pound champion,
he started in around 85 pounds.
Oh,
Jesus.

1854
01:39:10.260 --> 01:39:15.000
How crazy is that?
He's big too,
man.
Big.
He's a big dude as well.
Yeah.

1855
01:39:15.001 --> 01:39:17.460
These 45 pounders,
right?
Yeah.
Look,

1856
01:39:17.610 --> 01:39:20.250
I wish there was a way to stop all this nonsense.

1857
01:39:20.251 --> 01:39:21.900
I wish everybody did it the way you're doing it,

1858
01:39:21.901 --> 01:39:23.960
where you're just a little bit overweight.
Yeah.

1859
01:39:24.150 --> 01:39:27.240
Have you ever been heavier before?
We had to cut [inaudible] never.

1860
01:39:27.241 --> 01:39:29.330
So it's always been your way?
Yeah.
Yeah.

1861
01:39:29.340 --> 01:39:32.700
And a good thing too is that I always train it the weight I'm going to be in the

1862
01:39:32.700 --> 01:39:33.533
night of my fight.

1863
01:39:33.720 --> 01:39:38.040
So if I went at one 35 so I'm going to be one 50 when I walk in the cage.

1864
01:39:38.220 --> 01:39:42.810
So I train at one 51 I'm going to fight 20 fives I'll probably walk in the cage

1865
01:39:42.811 --> 01:39:47.520
when like one 40 or low low forties I'm going to train at low forties you know,

1866
01:39:47.521 --> 01:39:51.570
and that's why my cancer longer I get in shape before I start my camp cause I

1867
01:39:51.571 --> 01:39:52.404
want to be,

1868
01:39:52.530 --> 01:39:55.070
I want to know exactly what that feeling is of what the night's going to be of

1869
01:39:55.110 --> 01:39:57.270
being in the cage.
And I want to be in shape.

1870
01:39:57.540 --> 01:39:59.670
Oh my weight to be where it's supposed to be.

1871
01:40:00.150 --> 01:40:02.490
And so it's like the same exact feeling from my whole camp.

1872
01:40:03.120 --> 01:40:06.570
It's got to be satisfying for you to have all these changes,

1873
01:40:06.571 --> 01:40:07.980
take all these chances,

1874
01:40:07.981 --> 01:40:10.830
go through all this emotional shit with leaving alpha male.

1875
01:40:10.831 --> 01:40:15.000
But the results prove themselves that you were making the right choices for your

1876
01:40:15.001 --> 01:40:19.980
career.
Very satisfying.
And I'm building my own,
my own everything,
you know,

1877
01:40:20.010 --> 01:40:20.843
um,

1878
01:40:20.970 --> 01:40:23.640
it's all kind of fighting in place in this because I've surrounded myself with

1879
01:40:23.641 --> 01:40:26.100
the right people.
I fall dewayne cause I believed in him.

1880
01:40:26.430 --> 01:40:29.280
I came back to southern California because I believe in Sam,
you know,

1881
01:40:29.281 --> 01:40:32.490
and there's guys like Steve Martin like I was talking about before that made

1882
01:40:32.491 --> 01:40:35.400
that possible,
you know,
and there's just like these,
for whatever reason,

1883
01:40:35.401 --> 01:40:37.140
this group of guys that I've just gotten around,

1884
01:40:37.141 --> 01:40:40.170
it's just a very synergistic and it works,
you know?

1885
01:40:40.170 --> 01:40:43.200
And so that's why I've been really focused on,

1886
01:40:43.201 --> 01:40:48.201
cause I've been to a lot of gyms that are money driven or ego driven and to make

1887
01:40:48.211 --> 01:40:50.310
sure that's not the case.
So you might be an awesome fighter,

1888
01:40:50.311 --> 01:40:53.440
but if you don't have the right mentality,
you're not part of the training lab,

1889
01:40:53.950 --> 01:40:57.970
you know,
um,
you might be the best fighter in the world,
but if you're a cancer,

1890
01:40:57.971 --> 01:41:01.180
we're not going to let you work out there and kind of really treating it like

1891
01:41:01.181 --> 01:41:02.950
we're professional athletes,
you know,
I mean we,

1892
01:41:02.951 --> 01:41:05.560
I am treated like we're professional athletes instead of before it was just a

1893
01:41:05.561 --> 01:41:06.730
fighter.
Well you,

1894
01:41:06.760 --> 01:41:10.690
have you seen that really across the board there's much more of an attitude of a

1895
01:41:10.691 --> 01:41:15.520
professional athlete versus just some bad ass guy who wants to fight and kick

1896
01:41:15.521 --> 01:41:19.690
ass and you're,
you're seeing people approach it much more scientifically now,

1897
01:41:19.900 --> 01:41:24.520
how much has that changed since you were on the ultimate fighter?
A lot.
A lot.

1898
01:41:24.521 --> 01:41:26.830
A lot.
When I first,
like I said,
when I first got an ultimate fighter,

1899
01:41:26.831 --> 01:41:30.250
I was a Alpha male and we sparred four or five days a week.

1900
01:41:30.251 --> 01:41:33.730
And was that 2012 1111 yeah,

1901
01:41:33.731 --> 01:41:38.470
2011 and then it can't air it,
I think 2012 so you think about that,

1902
01:41:38.471 --> 01:41:41.320
that's not that long ago.
We're talking about six,
seven years.

1903
01:41:41.530 --> 01:41:45.850
So in seven years the sports radically changed big time.
Wow.

1904
01:41:46.240 --> 01:41:47.073
I mean,

1905
01:41:47.260 --> 01:41:51.100
I mean it's also because of how big the and how mainstream the UFC is getting,

1906
01:41:51.130 --> 01:41:54.460
you know,
we're going to be on ESPN were on Fox.
We,
you know,
we went from spike,

1907
01:41:54.461 --> 01:41:58.270
like the more and more mainstream gives them more like legit,
it makes it in.

1908
01:41:58.271 --> 01:42:00.100
The more legitimate is the more science behind it.

1909
01:42:00.101 --> 01:42:02.510
The more that like why wouldn't guys that are smarter,

1910
01:42:02.530 --> 01:42:07.300
same Kalvia go for football because there's money and there's like exposure

1911
01:42:07.301 --> 01:42:10.660
behind it and we're going,
it was fighting,
it was so raw and just like whatever.

1912
01:42:11.350 --> 01:42:16.350
I feel like since it's so legitimized those smart trainers and now the guys that

1913
01:42:16.580 --> 01:42:20.590
we've been fighting forever are now coaches.
It just makes it more legit.

1914
01:42:20.591 --> 01:42:24.870
And you have more science and the ways to train behind it.
Yeah,
no,
it's,

1915
01:42:24.871 --> 01:42:26.160
it's really exciting.
I'm,

1916
01:42:26.210 --> 01:42:29.740
it's still growing and I feel like we're on the cutting edge of everything.
Um,

1917
01:42:29.770 --> 01:42:32.700
we don't,
we don't miss anything.
We don't miss anything.
Like we're in the,

1918
01:42:33.280 --> 01:42:38.280
this is by far of any place I've ever chained the most scientific and smart way

1919
01:42:39.161 --> 01:42:42.540
to train.
That's so exciting man.
Really is.
Tj has got a,

1920
01:42:42.790 --> 01:42:46.180
a bump in the marshaller evolutionary chain as far as how many people were

1921
01:42:46.181 --> 01:42:50.110
switching stances and having that fluid flow before TJ stepped in the kitchen.

1922
01:42:50.111 --> 01:42:52.060
Not that many.
Not that many at all.

1923
01:42:52.950 --> 01:42:56.860
Tom Switched his legs back and forth by the attacks.
Yeah,
it didn't,

1924
01:42:56.950 --> 01:42:59.140
he didn't fight the same way.
Right.

1925
01:42:59.141 --> 01:43:01.440
He as he did left you the way you do kind of like a,

1926
01:43:01.450 --> 01:43:05.290
you've seen it now in boxing too.
Like um,
it turns cough,
Terrence Crawford Hill,

1927
01:43:05.620 --> 01:43:08.200
he'll come out orthodox cause he's right handed.
But he's like,

1928
01:43:08.290 --> 01:43:11.110
I'm going to do better against this guy softball and in stay softball the rest

1929
01:43:11.111 --> 01:43:14.680
of the fight because he sees that advantage and being able to do that.

1930
01:43:14.710 --> 01:43:17.020
I mean boxers used say like never switched your stance.

1931
01:43:17.021 --> 01:43:21.610
Your defense won't be as good.
But now Marvin Hagler used to switch all the time.

1932
01:43:21.910 --> 01:43:25.000
You know,
here's one of the greatest of all time.
You know,
there's Orthodox,

1933
01:43:25.010 --> 01:43:25.511
the softball,

1934
01:43:25.511 --> 01:43:28.030
but then there's a whole world of things that you can do offensive and

1935
01:43:28.070 --> 01:43:31.040
defensively during the change of that stance as well.
That's people

1936
01:43:34.300 --> 01:43:34.931
over the edge here.

1937
01:43:34.931 --> 01:43:37.580
It's one thing to switch your stance to fight better that stance,

1938
01:43:37.660 --> 01:43:42.320
but then what about the strikes while switching your stance or in those crazy

1939
01:43:42.321 --> 01:43:44.680
emotions where I'm coming this way,
but you're over there.
I could fight.

1940
01:43:44.681 --> 01:43:46.150
It's almost like fighting two people at once,

1941
01:43:46.950 --> 01:43:50.770
Bill and create those angles and take advantage of them and they have to do this

1942
01:43:50.771 --> 01:43:52.070
slow to stay in

1943
01:43:52.070 --> 01:43:54.320
<v 3>their stance kind of thing,
you know?
Yeah,
no,
there's,</v>

1944
01:43:54.321 --> 01:43:56.640
there's fantastic event still stuck in a matrix

1945
01:43:59.710 --> 01:44:02.830
<v 1>mapping out the killer shot him.
It may series and get a bunch of MMA flow drills</v>

1946
01:44:02.900 --> 01:44:03.733
<v 3>going to hell.
Yeah.</v>

1947
01:44:03.740 --> 01:44:07.640
I'm really excited about the switch down to ESPN to you're really excited about

1948
01:44:07.641 --> 01:44:10.790
getting the UFC on ESPN.
I think it's a big deal,
man.

1949
01:44:10.820 --> 01:44:14.930
ESPN is such a huge venue for sports and there's so many like,
oh,

1950
01:44:14.931 --> 01:44:17.750
just hardcore sports fans.
You know when you think of sports,

1951
01:44:17.751 --> 01:44:21.920
it's ESPN shore and you think of like sports bars that have been fights on,

1952
01:44:21.921 --> 01:44:25.510
I mean if they have,
they're going to have ESPN on.
Yeah,
it's just this is,

1953
01:44:25.720 --> 01:44:28.040
I mean so many people just,
they just turn their TV on.

1954
01:44:28.041 --> 01:44:32.120
They put on ESPN and that's like all day long real sports fans.

1955
01:44:32.150 --> 01:44:35.100
They're going to get a chance to see guys like you,
you know,

1956
01:44:35.450 --> 01:44:39.170
real high level fighters and ESPN is also been putting on real world

1957
01:44:39.171 --> 01:44:42.450
championship boxing events,
which is very exciting there.

1958
01:44:42.560 --> 01:44:45.440
If they're going to do that and then they're gonna start putting on real high

1959
01:44:45.441 --> 01:44:47.540
level championship UFC fights as well,

1960
01:44:47.541 --> 01:44:50.780
people are going to get a chance to compare and contrast and see like,
wow,

1961
01:44:51.050 --> 01:44:52.640
I think it's going to open up a whole new world.

1962
01:44:52.910 --> 01:44:56.540
I think Fox was great and all the fuss,
but there's like,

1963
01:44:56.541 --> 01:44:59.660
what is it like 80 Fox sports channels and no one knows which one the fuck it's

1964
01:44:59.661 --> 01:44:59.980
on.

1965
01:44:59.980 --> 01:45:02.810
<v 1>Yeah,
there are a lot of fucks channels.
Right.
That's crazy.
Yeah.</v>

1966
01:45:03.360 --> 01:45:06.870
I remember years ago when my,
uh,
Japan killin trips,

1967
01:45:07.230 --> 01:45:10.080
we went to a restaurant and they were showing some fights on TV and we lost her

1968
01:45:10.081 --> 01:45:13.020
shit with like all these shit,
the show and fights on TV,
Japan.
So cool.

1969
01:45:13.320 --> 01:45:15.120
Now it's out here all the time.
So,
you know,

1970
01:45:15.121 --> 01:45:17.040
thank you Dana White for Tito brothers,
you know,

1971
01:45:17.041 --> 01:45:20.850
the EOC for making it mainstream,
you know,
they're,
they and you as well,

1972
01:45:20.851 --> 01:45:25.140
Mr Ogun for having bringing martial arts to being so popular.
It is now.

1973
01:45:25.180 --> 01:45:28.890
It's like you guys have helped the evolution of martial arts come to come to

1974
01:45:28.891 --> 01:45:30.120
life and it's,
it's fun.

1975
01:45:30.500 --> 01:45:31.900
<v 3>It is fun and it's,
you know,</v>

1976
01:45:31.910 --> 01:45:34.790
people getting a chance to see where it's at right now,
which I don't think,

1977
01:45:35.220 --> 01:45:40.220
you know,
if someone hadn't seen a fight,
like your fight with Cody or your fight,

1978
01:45:40.250 --> 01:45:43.490
your first fight with Hanan Barao was a great example that your second fight was

1979
01:45:43.491 --> 01:45:46.430
really like a blowout.
I felt like in the sacrifice.
He just,

1980
01:45:46.490 --> 01:45:49.400
he knew you're going to fuck them up before the fight even started to evolve.

1981
01:45:49.520 --> 01:45:53.120
Yeah.
He didn't evolve.
Um,
but if you see these high level,

1982
01:45:53.380 --> 01:45:55.130
we know worldclass fights.

1983
01:45:55.131 --> 01:45:58.520
I think if people just got to look and what's what's going on right now at the

1984
01:45:58.521 --> 01:46:02.260
top level,
they'd get hooked,
you know,
real quick.
Well,

1985
01:46:02.280 --> 01:46:06.080
I mean you do a great job of um,
teaching people,
you know,

1986
01:46:07.100 --> 01:46:11.560
the commentators as well as people involved in journalists of MMA needed to

1987
01:46:11.561 --> 01:46:15.800
teach the average fan what to look for.
And I feel like he'd done a great job,

1988
01:46:15.801 --> 01:46:17.570
but if you've helped our sport grow because of that,

1989
01:46:17.571 --> 01:46:22.571
of not only hyping the fights up but making people knowledgeable of the MMA,

1990
01:46:23.090 --> 01:46:25.340
you know,
we need to teach the judges.
Yeah.

1991
01:46:27.560 --> 01:46:30.630
I haven't done the best job.
They're out there still.
I mean,

1992
01:46:30.631 --> 01:46:33.400
I just don't understand what commissions are waiting for.
I really don't.
Yeah,

1993
01:46:33.440 --> 01:46:36.890
I don't,
I don't get,
what's the hold up?
Just these people were in competent.

1994
01:46:36.891 --> 01:46:39.080
Fire them,
get new people.
And it's not hard to do.

1995
01:46:39.440 --> 01:46:40.610
I don't believe it's hard to do.
I think,

1996
01:46:40.790 --> 01:46:43.960
I think a motivated person to fix the entire system inside of it.

1997
01:46:43.970 --> 01:46:45.800
You don't feel like they're worried about their job.

1998
01:46:45.801 --> 01:46:48.350
If the men get a bad decision,
like if I,
if I ruin your career,

1999
01:46:48.351 --> 01:46:51.730
if I still millions dollars out of your pocket,
what does it say?

2000
01:46:51.740 --> 01:46:54.750
Understand that aspect.
You know,
that they doing people's career.

2001
01:46:54.780 --> 01:46:58.260
I don't think they're just doing their job and they think they're insulated

2002
01:46:58.261 --> 01:47:00.690
trauma.
I don't have a job.

2003
01:47:00.750 --> 01:47:02.790
They have to be accountable because they still have a name,

2004
01:47:03.030 --> 01:47:06.480
you know their name gets,
you know,
you know Adelai bird scored the fight,

2005
01:47:06.520 --> 01:47:09.810
blah blah blah blah.
And you know,
you hear that.
So they're accountable somewhat.

2006
01:47:09.811 --> 01:47:13.590
And then people hear certain names and they're like,
oh not this fucking guy.

2007
01:47:14.040 --> 01:47:16.940
Cause you know that that guy's given some shitty ass decisions in the past,

2008
01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:21.210
but it's not enough.
And if you just left it off to,

2009
01:47:21.360 --> 01:47:25.090
if you ran it through a computer and looked at all the bad decisions and all
the,

2010
01:47:25.100 --> 01:47:28.560
the judges that call these bad decisions and rate them like an Uber driver,

2011
01:47:28.970 --> 01:47:32.670
he just get rid of them.
Just anyone who just gets a d or below,

2012
01:47:32.671 --> 01:47:36.720
just get rid of him.
You really know anyone who gets below in a,
you know,

2013
01:47:36.750 --> 01:47:41.160
I mean people are gonna make some questionable subjective decisions.

2014
01:47:41.490 --> 01:47:44.460
Some people like a submission game,
some people like a strike and game.

2015
01:47:44.760 --> 01:47:45.480
Some people big.

2016
01:47:45.480 --> 01:47:48.330
Some people think that guide takes you down no matter what he's on top of you

2017
01:47:48.331 --> 01:47:52.350
win.
Yes.
Well I feel like,
well they said it's going to not matter as much now,

2018
01:47:52.351 --> 01:47:55.110
but if you do,
if you didn't take down,
you have no damage.
Like take down.

2019
01:47:55.111 --> 01:47:56.340
Didn't even count.
Yeah.

2020
01:47:56.400 --> 01:47:59.160
Which I believe in because it's really who's winning the fight.

2021
01:47:59.161 --> 01:48:03.050
Not like the position we're in right then even me being a wrestler like yeah,

2022
01:48:03.051 --> 01:48:04.950
I can take people down just winning from being on top.

2023
01:48:04.951 --> 01:48:08.070
But that's not how any makes you be scored.
No,
I agree.

2024
01:48:08.130 --> 01:48:11.550
And I think that if a guy does some damage standing up and then you take them

2025
01:48:11.551 --> 01:48:13.890
down and hold him down for a full minute,
but nothing happens,

2026
01:48:14.100 --> 01:48:15.630
he did more damage standing up.

2027
01:48:15.930 --> 01:48:18.020
And there's a lot of judges to think that if you take someone down,

2028
01:48:18.030 --> 01:48:21.990
you're on top,
you win.
And they can't think that way.
It's just,
it's not wise,

2029
01:48:22.170 --> 01:48:25.120
especially when guys are battling off submissions off their back and,

2030
01:48:25.590 --> 01:48:28.320
or getting busted up with elbows from their back.

2031
01:48:28.710 --> 01:48:30.900
I mean there's just,

2032
01:48:30.960 --> 01:48:35.860
did you see Nico prices fight where he won from his back?
The,

2033
01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:36.780
with the foot and yeah.

2034
01:48:36.780 --> 01:48:39.660
Howard fished him that was hammered fists at him from that bottom,

2035
01:48:39.990 --> 01:48:43.410
knocked him out.
It was one of the crazies who,
who did he fight?

2036
01:48:43.470 --> 01:48:46.370
I don't remember who that was and I get excited.
So yeah,

2037
01:48:46.580 --> 01:48:50.220
fought off off his back one by hammer fist.
Okay.

2038
01:48:50.250 --> 01:48:54.210
It's like we're realizing there's,
you're not really safe.
And then there's,

2039
01:48:54.211 --> 01:48:56.580
there's things that people could figure out what to do and weird,

2040
01:48:56.581 --> 01:48:58.770
different places to find a way to be successful.

2041
01:48:59.790 --> 01:49:04.410
I just as much enthusiasm as you have about the sport and if you and myself and

2042
01:49:04.411 --> 01:49:07.800
a lot of other fans,
I want the judges to have that kind of enthusiasm as well.

2043
01:49:07.830 --> 01:49:11.840
Yeah.
I want them to go into these fights knowing what they're looking at.

2044
01:49:11.840 --> 01:49:15.450
So here it is right here.
Oh.
Like right before that does it show?

2045
01:49:15.500 --> 01:49:20.190
It looked really this oh wow.
From his back.
Hammer fist.
Some unconscious.

2046
01:49:20.300 --> 01:49:24.750
Wow.
Fucking crazy.
Yeah.
Never seen that before in my life.
I mean either.

2047
01:49:26.480 --> 01:49:28.950
And that's something that I don't know if he would see that in the curriculum or

2048
01:49:28.951 --> 01:49:32.880
not,
but well,
he's an opportunity in that position.
It's a good place to be.

2049
01:49:32.881 --> 01:49:35.270
When guys start seeing it happen,
they're going to go for it more.
Lauren,

2050
01:49:35.271 --> 01:49:35.681
you know,
you know,

2051
01:49:35.681 --> 01:49:39.790
you're going to see fighters go for that while the Travis Browne,
you know,

2052
01:49:39.900 --> 01:49:43.370
the elbow will honor from defending the takedown.

2053
01:49:44.310 --> 01:49:48.220
Travis started kaolin people.
He Kao Josh Barnett,
He Cha k

2054
01:49:48.220 --> 01:49:51.940
<v 0>owed um,
uh,
Gabriel Gonzaga same way.
Yup.</v>

2055
01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:55.060
He flatlines people from that position,
those long ass crazy.

2056
01:49:55.190 --> 01:49:58.190
It's an Alpha brain than I do.
What do you mean you're sharp?

2057
01:49:59.060 --> 01:50:02.290
You might have some stronger alphabet than the night job.
His job,

2058
01:50:02.350 --> 01:50:05.890
his job is to know this stuff there.
Your Alpha brain turbo that we're working.

2059
01:50:06.760 --> 01:50:11.440
Is it here now?
Uh,
no,
I have it at my house.
I said just a stronger version.
Yeah,

2060
01:50:11.441 --> 01:50:15.130
it's got some extra shit in it.
I'll worry about that a couple of years ago.
Yeah.

2061
01:50:16.030 --> 01:50:18.790
We keep,
our original Alpha brain was giving people headaches.

2062
01:50:18.820 --> 01:50:22.390
We had adjusted along the way.
Some people obviously the weaker

2063
01:50:24.550 --> 01:50:27.500
rigor you weren't made to take on the brain.
You know what I mean?
It's,

2064
01:50:27.501 --> 01:50:29.740
it's a dose dependent thing and it's also,

2065
01:50:29.770 --> 01:50:32.590
there's people that get headaches and they drink caffeine and people that can't

2066
01:50:32.591 --> 01:50:36.550
drink milk.
You know,
there's a lot of bio biological variability,
but a,

2067
01:50:36.551 --> 01:50:37.211
what this is,

2068
01:50:37.211 --> 01:50:40.720
is a more potent version of Alpha and we're pushing the boundaries a little bit.

2069
01:50:40.930 --> 01:50:44.900
So we're going to run some tests on it.
And so we've got some trials and um,

2070
01:50:45.010 --> 01:50:49.880
I've been taking it and send me a couple,
I'll test it for you.
It works.
It's,

2071
01:50:49.910 --> 01:50:52.180
it's got some DMT.
It a little bit of Alpha brain.

2072
01:50:52.210 --> 01:50:54.280
You know what I really liked too,
and I've talked about this before,

2073
01:50:54.281 --> 01:50:57.460
is a neuro one.
It's a Bill Roman House keys company.

2074
01:50:57.640 --> 01:51:01.330
He's got a great nootropics supplement.
I'd like it to taste good too.

2075
01:51:01.540 --> 01:51:03.430
I drink the chocolate.
I feel like bill room,

2076
01:51:03.450 --> 01:51:06.570
we're asking you now the way I walk around with all my supplements and stuff,

2077
01:51:06.600 --> 01:51:08.410
he's got like a tackle box of them.
I do man.

2078
01:51:08.411 --> 01:51:11.740
Like when I travel now it's like I have a whole suitcase full of supplements.

2079
01:51:12.450 --> 01:51:14.600
It was like no matter where you go.
Yeah.

2080
01:51:14.920 --> 01:51:17.290
So even if you're on it like a couple of day road trip somewhere,

2081
01:51:17.291 --> 01:51:20.110
you bring in all your supplements with you though.
I have those divider packs.

2082
01:51:20.111 --> 01:51:21.250
You don't have to have like three of them.

2083
01:51:21.790 --> 01:51:26.200
Don't fuck around even though on a hunting trip.
Really?
Oh yeah man.
Wow.

2084
01:51:26.700 --> 01:51:29.290
Trippy.
Eat Clean.
Yeah,

2085
01:51:29.590 --> 01:51:34.060
I do Boston and those mountain house fucking fettuccine Alfredo drink go.

2086
01:51:34.070 --> 01:51:37.250
Let's freeze dried.
Like farts are so bad though.
But once you,

2087
01:51:37.251 --> 01:51:39.790
once you've been like so clean,
you know how it feels.

2088
01:51:40.090 --> 01:51:43.210
And then after your fight you eat like a fucking asshole for a week.
Yeah.

2089
01:51:43.350 --> 01:51:46.510
He ain't say,
he was like,
dude,
I gotta stop.
I gotta stop this shit.
Like I feel,

2090
01:51:46.660 --> 01:51:49.510
I feel depressed.
I feel horrible.
Like I gotta get back into eating clean.

2091
01:51:49.511 --> 01:51:52.030
You know,
it's like much time to just take her off after the Cody fight.

2092
01:51:52.120 --> 01:51:55.600
The second one,
a food nutrition wise,
probably like a week maybe.

2093
01:51:55.601 --> 01:51:58.600
Or maybe like when hot,
but even then it's just like,
not the whole day.

2094
01:51:58.630 --> 01:52:00.820
It's just like,
I'll have one bad meal and I'm like,
Oh fuck.

2095
01:52:00.821 --> 01:52:03.290
I shouldn't have done that.
Like I'm gonna feel that shit.

2096
01:52:03.580 --> 01:52:06.820
It like wanting a pizza,
cause you know you shouldn't have it.

2097
01:52:07.030 --> 01:52:09.430
Like looking at that pizza,
go fuck it.
We're going in.

2098
01:52:09.850 --> 01:52:13.510
Well now I never used to be a sweet tooth,
but now it's sugar.
It's desserts.

2099
01:52:13.511 --> 01:52:16.250
Like I used to be more just like a eat more pizza,
like stay,

2100
01:52:16.251 --> 01:52:18.880
whatever it could be.
But now since I haven't been eating sugar,

2101
01:52:19.060 --> 01:52:23.200
I want to drink a soda.
I want to don't know.
Regular Soda.
Regular Soda.
Yeah.

2102
01:52:23.470 --> 01:52:25.720
When I drink a regular soda,
the first thing I think,

2103
01:52:25.750 --> 01:52:27.670
I can't believe people drink this.

2104
01:52:28.250 --> 01:52:32.200
I don't like drinking this shit all day long cause I don't drink it.

2105
01:52:32.201 --> 01:52:36.310
So when I drink it my body's like,
what the fuck are you doing?
Stupid.

2106
01:52:36.340 --> 01:52:41.340
Like I had a mountain dew after the fight I felt I felt like hung over the next

2107
01:52:41.500 --> 01:52:44.840
day.
It's weird at your tolerance drops too.

2108
01:52:45.200 --> 01:52:47.480
If you don't eat sugar anymore and then you take it in.

2109
01:52:47.540 --> 01:52:49.820
The first thing that happens to me like I'll have an ice cream Sundae.

2110
01:52:50.030 --> 01:52:54.200
I just have to sit down.
I'm like,
oh dude,
the sugars,
the root of all evil man.

2111
01:52:54.620 --> 01:52:58.710
It's so bad.
Body high doses.
Yeah.

2112
01:52:58.850 --> 01:53:01.860
Like you know people that walked around with a two liter Pepsi and just chug it

2113
01:53:04.700 --> 01:53:05.533
man.

2114
01:53:05.600 --> 01:53:08.770
I mean how many fucking servings are in a two liter Pepsi and some people will

2115
01:53:08.780 --> 01:53:10.910
drink that whole thing in a day.
Easy.
Thank you.

2116
01:53:10.911 --> 01:53:15.770
See the truck drivers on the [inaudible] on everyone just fill in their arteries

2117
01:53:15.771 --> 01:53:20.240
was black lacquer insights,
all that fat,

2118
01:53:20.270 --> 01:53:25.010
gut fat.
Just the lower abdominal fat pushes into your balls,

2119
01:53:27.460 --> 01:53:30.090
get another Pepsi.

2120
01:53:30.110 --> 01:53:35.030
Just so uncomfortable that they have like the Steven does.

2121
01:53:35.031 --> 01:53:38.930
Cvs Stone is those ones tastes good.
Those are all good.
ZV is are great.

2122
01:53:39.530 --> 01:53:41.270
I drink those all the time.
Feel free.

2123
01:53:41.730 --> 01:53:45.590
The difference between them and a diet coke in terms of flavor,

2124
01:53:45.591 --> 01:53:49.070
I actually liked them better.
When I drink diet coke.
Dot.
I'm like,
ah.

2125
01:53:49.071 --> 01:53:51.370
It's kind of fucking case chemicals.
Yeah.

2126
01:53:51.660 --> 01:53:53.960
Whereas via just tastes like a good flavor,

2127
01:53:54.170 --> 01:53:59.150
but it doesn't make you feel like shit.
You don't,
there's no glycaemic index.

2128
01:53:59.840 --> 01:54:02.420
There's no change in your sugar levels.
You just taste good.

2129
01:54:02.460 --> 01:54:07.430
It almost feels like there's no way it's,
there's no sugar in it.
No.
Yeah.

2130
01:54:07.520 --> 01:54:11.000
This stuff,
Stevia is an interesting thing because too much of it,

2131
01:54:11.001 --> 01:54:13.790
it tastes like shit.
It's kind of weird aftertaste,
right?
Yeah.

2132
01:54:13.791 --> 01:54:17.070
You gotta it's so potent.
You just need like a touch.
Yes,

2133
01:54:17.150 --> 01:54:19.490
but when you put it in your coffee,
like I'll put it in there like sugar,

2134
01:54:19.491 --> 01:54:23.420
but they are like,
whoa,
whoa.
Nope.
It's rough.
Different.

2135
01:54:23.750 --> 01:54:27.800
What other stuff does he have you eating that you weren't eating before?

2136
01:54:27.880 --> 01:54:32.880
Was there any like concentration on like different kinds of greens or w I juice

2137
01:54:33.231 --> 01:54:36.950
like crazy now and you're juicing mostly green stuff.
A lot of it,

2138
01:54:36.951 --> 01:54:41.530
I mean there's this,
um,
do you blend or you know,
I juice,

2139
01:54:41.540 --> 01:54:45.470
I do masticating juicer a cold press juicer.
You gotta.

2140
01:54:45.980 --> 01:54:47.570
Cause if it's something fast,
like a blender,

2141
01:54:47.571 --> 01:54:50.270
it kills a lot of the nutrients and you absorb more of that.

2142
01:54:50.271 --> 01:54:53.000
So even if you were just the eat this giant table of raw food,

2143
01:54:53.540 --> 01:54:56.270
you would absorb less of it than if you juiced it.
Really?
Why is that?

2144
01:54:56.271 --> 01:54:57.500
Because it goes right in your bloodstream.

2145
01:54:57.610 --> 01:54:59.630
It's something about how your body breaks it down.
Yeah.

2146
01:54:59.631 --> 01:55:03.110
So something about the cold press juice is,
is your body's absorbing it more.
So,

2147
01:55:03.111 --> 01:55:04.380
I mean that's,
that's like,
uh,

2148
01:55:04.450 --> 01:55:07.250
a half to even when I'm traveling and how my juicer,
I ended up buying them,

2149
01:55:07.251 --> 01:55:11.930
which aren't as good,
but I have to drink some sort of green juice every day.

2150
01:55:12.920 --> 01:55:15.920
And Are you taking it with any kind of fat?
Because what I heard about,

2151
01:55:16.070 --> 01:55:19.460
especially with vegetable juice,
that your body absorbs it better with fat,

2152
01:55:19.760 --> 01:55:23.110
like with coconut oil or avocado oil or something like that.
Yeah,
we do that.

2153
01:55:23.180 --> 01:55:28.110
We do a,
yes,
we have to do a certain certain kinds of MCT oil.
Um,
I take,

2154
01:55:28.130 --> 01:55:31.700
uh,
of tablespoons in the day and then an eye to help absorb not only that,

2155
01:55:31.701 --> 01:55:34.940
but then the ubiquinol goes with it helped me like rebuild red blood cells and

2156
01:55:35.480 --> 01:55:38.810
do a bunch of,
what does ubiquinol it's also some sort of oil.

2157
01:55:38.840 --> 01:55:39.680
I take them in a pill,

2158
01:55:39.740 --> 01:55:44.130
but some sort of like a oil that helps with the transport chain of,
I couldn't

2159
01:55:44.130 --> 01:55:46.830
<v 3>even tell you I get salmon.
He'd be,</v>

2160
01:55:47.730 --> 01:55:50.130
he'd probably try to hold back point to get him in here.
Dude.

2161
01:55:50.730 --> 01:55:53.490
He'd be very interesting.
But a,
I almost don't want you to,

2162
01:55:53.491 --> 01:55:55.420
cause that's where all my secrets on.

2163
01:55:58.380 --> 01:56:01.050
There's people that just wouldn't listen anyway.
Yeah,
that's true.

2164
01:56:01.240 --> 01:56:03.390
Because so many people that would then they would listen and they wouldn't

2165
01:56:03.391 --> 01:56:06.780
really follow it.
But it's a full time fucking job though.
You know what I mean?

2166
01:56:06.781 --> 01:56:09.480
Like you can't be lazy and do to do Sam Shit.

2167
01:56:09.540 --> 01:56:11.220
Like I can't imagine how you could be,

2168
01:56:11.221 --> 01:56:12.960
it seems like you have to be on top of it all the time.

2169
01:56:13.020 --> 01:56:15.420
I don't have time in the day to do all this shit that he hasn't been doing it as

2170
01:56:15.421 --> 01:56:18.920
well as training.
So do you take the MCT oil with the green shoes?

2171
01:56:19.210 --> 01:56:22.080
Oh you can or just take it and for people don't know what that is.

2172
01:56:22.080 --> 01:56:25.890
A medium change.
Triglyceride oil is derived from coconut oil,

2173
01:56:25.891 --> 01:56:30.450
so it's a the more nutritious form of coconut oil so you can take it.

2174
01:56:30.460 --> 01:56:33.600
But what it was explained to me was that you're better off when you're taking

2175
01:56:33.601 --> 01:56:36.900
something that's as nutrient dense as juice,
cold press juice,

2176
01:56:37.080 --> 01:56:40.590
that you really should take it with a fat and then it'll help your body absorb

2177
01:56:40.591 --> 01:56:44.610
the nutrients better.
And I don't know,
he never told us that.
Okay,

2178
01:56:44.760 --> 01:56:47.070
but maybe I'm wrong and I don't know.
I mean he didn't matter.
No,

2179
01:56:47.160 --> 01:56:49.620
he doesn't know everything.
What I know.
But take Kale shakes.

2180
01:56:49.621 --> 01:56:54.621
I always add either coconut oil or why I usually at both coconut oil and MCT oil

2181
01:56:56.040 --> 01:56:59.150
to it.
I mean,
I think that's not bad for you.
So why not?
You know,

2182
01:56:59.490 --> 01:57:03.330
I don't know if it's better or not,
but I know it's not bad for you.
Yeah.
Now,
um,

2183
01:57:03.390 --> 01:57:05.820
what is your ratio like fats to protein?

2184
01:57:05.821 --> 01:57:08.150
Do you know what that is or does heat map all that stuff,
apps,

2185
01:57:08.160 --> 01:57:11.820
all of that out and depending where I'm at and how my body is recovering,
um,

2186
01:57:12.330 --> 01:57:17.010
but yeah,
I'm high,
high fat,
high protein diet,
you know,
um,
low to no carb.

2187
01:57:17.250 --> 01:57:19.770
Obviously different kinds of carbs.
I have to have carbs,

2188
01:57:19.771 --> 01:57:22.080
but just like I won't be Ketogenic,

2189
01:57:22.081 --> 01:57:24.750
but I would get my body into ketosis certain times throughout my camp.

2190
01:57:25.230 --> 01:57:30.060
Make me insulin like,
um,
sensitivity high.
Right?
Um,

2191
01:57:30.810 --> 01:57:33.160
so I'll eat like simple carbs or breakdown faster.
You know,

2192
01:57:33.180 --> 01:57:35.760
they've found that people even on this carnivore diet,

2193
01:57:35.761 --> 01:57:38.010
which a lot of people are doing now,
they still reach ketosis.

2194
01:57:38.130 --> 01:57:41.430
It's still reached ketosis because they're not taking any grain and not taking

2195
01:57:41.431 --> 01:57:42.390
it any carbohydrates.

2196
01:57:42.391 --> 01:57:46.230
And even though your body converts protein through Glucogenesis,

2197
01:57:46.231 --> 01:57:50.110
they couldn't converts it into sugars and to glucose.
Um,
it's,
it,

2198
01:57:50.130 --> 01:57:53.790
it's doing it in a very efficient way and processing in a way that a lot of

2199
01:57:53.791 --> 01:57:57.420
these people are in Ketosis all the day.
Most of the time just not,

2200
01:57:57.421 --> 01:58:01.290
not the same like high levels.
If you were going like a regular ketogenic diet,

2201
01:58:01.291 --> 01:58:04.770
I think it's supposed to be 70% fat,

2202
01:58:05.230 --> 01:58:08.850
something crazy or 60 something percent fat and then the rest protein.

2203
01:58:09.500 --> 01:58:12.650
Did you tell Jordan Peterson that isn't eating all meat?
Yeah,
hygiene.
Amit.

2204
01:58:12.660 --> 01:58:13.800
I don't,
I think,

2205
01:58:13.860 --> 01:58:17.860
and I had his daughter on recently as well and it's very controversial,
uh,

2206
01:58:17.970 --> 01:58:20.760
particularly for his daughter because his daughter was giving paid nutritional

2207
01:58:20.761 --> 01:58:24.300
consult consultation,
which doesn't really have a background in nutrition,

2208
01:58:24.301 --> 01:58:27.660
but she's just showing people what really has worked for her and her,

2209
01:58:27.720 --> 01:58:32.400
her experience and her background.
I think her and her father Jordan,

2210
01:58:32.460 --> 01:58:35.460
I think he has a serious autoimmune issue,
like serious.

2211
01:58:35.730 --> 01:58:39.570
And I think it's very possible that there are some people amongst us that are

2212
01:58:39.571 --> 01:58:42.120
allergic to almost everything.
Wow.

2213
01:58:42.340 --> 01:58:44.620
They have allergic reactions to all kinds of different foods.

2214
01:58:44.650 --> 01:58:48.100
I think it's really,
really rare.
I think for most people like you or I,

2215
01:58:48.370 --> 01:58:50.290
you're really better off eating rich,

2216
01:58:50.380 --> 01:58:54.550
dark green leafy vegetables and nuts and,

2217
01:58:54.620 --> 01:58:58.950
and fish and chicken and wild game and uh,
you know,

2218
01:58:58.960 --> 01:59:03.660
I think if you get some wild Turkey or some,
you know,
wild pheasants and just,

2219
01:59:03.790 --> 01:59:07.270
you should eat really good,
lean,
healthy,
real food.

2220
01:59:07.540 --> 01:59:11.800
I think most people can eat apples and oranges and watermelon and there's no

2221
01:59:11.801 --> 01:59:12.520
problem.

2222
01:59:12.520 --> 01:59:15.700
But I think there are a few people amongst us and I think Jordan's one of them

2223
01:59:15.940 --> 01:59:20.710
where his body just fucking rejects things.
I think he gets,

2224
01:59:20.711 --> 01:59:24.370
his body has terrible reactions to all these different things and going on an

2225
01:59:24.371 --> 01:59:27.030
all meat diet is cured.
His depression got him.

2226
01:59:27.031 --> 01:59:30.700
I'll find antidepressants for the first time in more than two decades.
Oh Wow.

2227
01:59:30.720 --> 01:59:34.210
It reduced his weight back to the weight it was when he was 25 years old.

2228
01:59:34.540 --> 01:59:39.170
I just don't think it's a viable or intelligent diet for everyone in mass as,

2229
01:59:39.190 --> 01:59:40.750
yeah.
Yeah.
I just think it's,

2230
01:59:40.780 --> 01:59:45.780
it's a good diet for people that are very extreme in their nutrition

2231
01:59:45.821 --> 01:59:48.880
requirements because they have some serious autoimmune issues.

2232
01:59:48.881 --> 01:59:51.790
If you have autoimmune issues,
you should definitely go towards Quito.
Yeah.

2233
01:59:51.850 --> 01:59:54.460
You know,
a Sam's gotten rid of my psoriasis.

2234
01:59:54.461 --> 01:59:56.080
I didn't even know you could get rid of it,

2235
01:59:56.081 --> 01:59:57.670
but got rid of my psoriasis with my diet.

2236
01:59:57.700 --> 02:00:00.970
I mean they say it could be from the stem cells too,
but I believe it's from,

2237
02:00:00.971 --> 02:00:04.840
I mean,
I did so much stuff,
but,
um,
the Diet,
you know,
well,

2238
02:00:05.170 --> 02:00:08.470
I know several people that have got rid of their psoriasis through that.

2239
02:00:09.010 --> 02:00:12.980
I think Jordan is actually one of them as well.
He had psoriasis,
the psoriasis.

2240
02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:16.000
He also had some serious gum disease that he was having for his whole life.

2241
02:00:16.330 --> 02:00:20.410
Gone as soon as he got in his carnivore diet.
And it's just,
I mean,
he's,

2242
02:00:20.411 --> 02:00:24.220
he just eating beef.
That's it.
I mean,
literally he drinks for drinks,

2243
02:00:24.221 --> 02:00:28.660
water and eats beef.
That is it bad for your,

2244
02:00:28.661 --> 02:00:32.560
like you would think so how Brock Lesnar got hurt,
right?
He doesn't say years.

2245
02:00:32.561 --> 02:00:34.520
Brock got diverticulitis.
Uh,

2246
02:00:34.540 --> 02:00:37.960
Anthony Bordain told me that sometimes people get diverticulitis from all sorts

2247
02:00:37.961 --> 02:00:41.020
of reasons.
From like eating.
You could have a seed,

2248
02:00:41.320 --> 02:00:44.920
like a fucking some seed from some plant.
The UAE,

2249
02:00:44.921 --> 02:00:47.040
it gets stuck somewhere in your lining.

2250
02:00:47.060 --> 02:00:49.990
It gets infected and you get diverticulitis from that.
He said,

2251
02:00:49.991 --> 02:00:51.880
diverticulitis can come from a lot of different things.

2252
02:00:52.150 --> 02:00:54.430
I think Brock probably wasn't even chewing.

2253
02:00:54.970 --> 02:00:59.880
I think he was probably swallowing animals out in the wild,
uh,

2254
02:01:00.100 --> 02:01:03.340
grabbing good fucking gophers and shit and just shut down,

2255
02:01:04.640 --> 02:01:08.500
screaming naked on the top of it.
Oh yeah,
that's sick.
Fuck.

2256
02:01:09.700 --> 02:01:13.840
I'm really bummed out that the WWE,
um,
ever had him.

2257
02:01:14.140 --> 02:01:17.890
I really feel like if Brock Lesnar had just gone from amateur wrestling,
dude,

2258
02:01:17.910 --> 02:01:20.590
he was a beast.
He's a beast.

2259
02:01:20.740 --> 02:01:24.580
And if he just completely dedicated himself to mixed martial arts from the jump,

2260
02:01:24.940 --> 02:01:29.260
I mean,
he's already looking,
knocked out.
Randy coture,
he battered Frank Mir.

2261
02:01:29.440 --> 02:01:31.400
I mean,
he submitted Shane Carwyn.

2262
02:01:31.450 --> 02:01:36.450
He already has an incredible resume for a guy that was a WWE star,

2263
02:01:36.870 --> 02:01:40.010
a multimillionaire star before he

2264
02:01:40.010 --> 02:01:43.220
<v 0>ever fought his first MMA fight.
Just such a savage.</v>

2265
02:01:43.400 --> 02:01:46.910
It was just beating inside of his heart so bad that he wanted to do it but came

2266
02:01:46.911 --> 02:01:51.500
in and did it.
Really did it last to cane lost a fucking Overeem.

2267
02:01:51.501 --> 02:01:53.120
I mean beat Mark Hunt.

2268
02:01:53.150 --> 02:01:56.600
Even though Mark Kahn says he was cheating it seems it might have been correct.

2269
02:01:58.630 --> 02:02:02.810
You know,
mark on went on a rant today about,
uh,
about Brock Lesnar.
Oh really?

2270
02:02:02.811 --> 02:02:06.350
I call them a cheat and piece of shit is mad that he's coming back to the UFC.

2271
02:02:07.160 --> 02:02:10.520
He's got,
he's got like a legit claim.
Yeah,
for sure he does.

2272
02:02:10.521 --> 02:02:13.040
I mean Brock's only fought the top of the top.

2273
02:02:13.041 --> 02:02:15.740
He's never fought like a warmup fight.
He's never came in and had a warmup fight.

2274
02:02:15.741 --> 02:02:19.990
You know,
I don't watch WWE,
but they say shrinking.
Oh yeah,

2275
02:02:20.570 --> 02:02:23.990
you saw it.
I was about to come in.
They're already,
is there a testing pool?

2276
02:02:24.020 --> 02:02:25.640
They're gonna be knocking on your door.
We already is.

2277
02:02:25.641 --> 02:02:27.440
That's what he's getting smaller.
They're knocking on your door.

2278
02:02:27.530 --> 02:02:31.390
Six o'clock in the morning.
Cause the problem when he fought hunt right here,

2279
02:02:31.450 --> 02:02:35.210
there was some stuff going to be tested or something.
Yeah,

2280
02:02:35.211 --> 02:02:36.770
there was some weird loophole.
Well,

2281
02:02:36.771 --> 02:02:40.480
so he retired and when you come back you're supposed to be go through like a

2282
02:02:40.490 --> 02:02:44.870
four month testing before we even allowed to accept a fight and they waive that

2283
02:02:44.871 --> 02:02:46.650
for month of testing and they just started like,

2284
02:02:46.670 --> 02:02:49.490
so he was getting tested once he came back.

2285
02:02:49.491 --> 02:02:52.550
But he didn't have to have that four month of testing without having a fight.

2286
02:02:53.340 --> 02:02:58.160
This is what I heard.
And you Sata.
Yup.
Well you saw it.
It's changed the game.

2287
02:02:58.161 --> 02:03:00.200
Kids change the game

2288
02:03:01.880 --> 02:03:03.800
and I look better than I did back then.

2289
02:03:04.420 --> 02:03:08.930
Jack City right now I'm better.
I'm looking better.

2290
02:03:08.931 --> 02:03:11.280
Like it's awesome man.
I'm,
I'm the,

2291
02:03:11.340 --> 02:03:14.270
the professionalism and that's going around like a brown spots.
Just,

2292
02:03:14.840 --> 02:03:18.230
it's just made me continue.
I mean I've always been hungry but uh,

2293
02:03:18.260 --> 02:03:21.830
just like the science behind it and maybe all to go three different weight

2294
02:03:21.831 --> 02:03:25.920
classes and being real and just me being the baddest man on the planet has got

2295
02:03:25.921 --> 02:03:27.740
me like ready to go.
You know,

2296
02:03:27.741 --> 02:03:30.890
like that's the only photos they have before and after I find a better one.

2297
02:03:30.891 --> 02:03:33.350
I'll try that.
Pull that one up again.
I didn't see much difference there.

2298
02:03:33.920 --> 02:03:35.360
Anybody pull that up,
Jamie?

2299
02:03:35.420 --> 02:03:40.000
Anybody who stands or sits the way Brock is sitting on the one on the right
here,

2300
02:03:40.320 --> 02:03:44.300
the his arms are spread wide no matter what.
He's going to be big.
Yeah,

2301
02:03:44.301 --> 02:03:48.170
he's still going to be 265 fucking pounds.
Yeah.

2302
02:03:48.980 --> 02:03:53.410
Okay.
Well there you kind of get it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He's,

2303
02:03:53.470 --> 02:03:57.680
he's losing some size definitely,
but he's going to keep a lot.

2304
02:03:58.100 --> 02:04:01.370
He's definitely gonna lose a lot.
The thing that's going to fuck with his head,

2305
02:04:01.430 --> 02:04:02.570
if anything,
does,

2306
02:04:02.660 --> 02:04:07.660
is when you are on steroids for a long time or anything,

2307
02:04:08.991 --> 02:04:12.050
that jacks up your endocrine system the way worth.

2308
02:04:12.140 --> 02:04:14.980
We're assuming he did your,
when it's so

2309
02:04:17.530 --> 02:04:21.230
this is so,
he's already gotten caught trying to talk to your lawyer,
sorry.
Oh,

2310
02:04:21.440 --> 02:04:22.460
you're assuming he did.

2311
02:04:22.490 --> 02:04:25.940
His endocrine system's gotta be struggling and he's 40 years old now.

2312
02:04:26.210 --> 02:04:28.970
I mean it's,
it's only 40 yeah.
Nothing.

2313
02:04:28.971 --> 02:04:32.150
He must not even be 40 he might be 39 how old is Brock Lesnar?

2314
02:04:33.350 --> 02:04:37.970
But he's 49 or 39 and Viking years.
The age.
Yeah.
What

2315
02:04:37.980 --> 02:04:42.630
<v 2>do you want?
41 41.
Yeah,
close enough.
He's got to get in now.
Why can,
yeah.</v>

2316
02:04:42.990 --> 02:04:47.370
Heck yeah.
So what do you think you did that elevated your testosterone?

2317
02:04:47.880 --> 02:04:49.980
I think,
um,
my recovery,

2318
02:04:50.070 --> 02:04:54.570
so not red lining my body all the freaking time I try.
I tried too hard.

2319
02:04:54.630 --> 02:04:57.240
Like I always went to hard.
I always wanted to do more.

2320
02:04:57.241 --> 02:04:59.730
I'm an oldest school wrestler.
Like more is better.
More is better.

2321
02:04:59.731 --> 02:05:00.850
Trained trainer.
No.

2322
02:05:01.350 --> 02:05:03.670
So my recovery big time listening to my body and this and that.

2323
02:05:03.710 --> 02:05:06.450
So by your heart rate variability,
when you're sleeping,

2324
02:05:06.451 --> 02:05:07.800
it'll tell you when you wake up,

2325
02:05:07.801 --> 02:05:09.900
how recovered you are and how hard you push it that day.

2326
02:05:10.110 --> 02:05:14.160
So being the CEO of Tj Dillashaw and deciding,
say if I,

2327
02:05:14.190 --> 02:05:16.850
even if it's on the schedule,
I'm going to go hard the next day,
but I wake up,

2328
02:05:16.870 --> 02:05:19.890
not recovered.
Call everyone like,
hey man,
I'm not coming in today.

2329
02:05:20.130 --> 02:05:22.530
I got to go walk around with the family.
I'm not training.

2330
02:05:22.740 --> 02:05:27.330
Taking it off so that you know by how many heartbeats difference.
Like,
it's not,

2331
02:05:27.331 --> 02:05:29.490
it's not the heartbeat.
It's how variability,
the variability.

2332
02:05:29.491 --> 02:05:32.790
So sometimes your heart,
your heart shouldn't just be everyone's every second.

2333
02:05:33.240 --> 02:05:37.980
It should be like 0.8,
1.4 seconds.
Like we're like all like,
like,

2334
02:05:37.981 --> 02:05:41.640
um,
so you're,
it'll tell you that your central nervous system,
it is not worn out.

2335
02:05:41.760 --> 02:05:43.860
So when you're getting sick or you're overworked,

2336
02:05:43.861 --> 02:05:48.090
you're body will tell you from your heart rate that that is about to happen,

2337
02:05:48.120 --> 02:05:48.391
you know?

2338
02:05:48.391 --> 02:05:51.060
So if you can catch it and if you don't listen to it and you just keep going,

2339
02:05:51.061 --> 02:05:53.910
like you go down this deep hole that you'll never come out of,
you know,

2340
02:05:53.911 --> 02:05:56.070
but if you'd catch it right away,
no matter what,

2341
02:05:56.071 --> 02:05:57.810
your body's always going to do peaks and valleys.

2342
02:05:58.100 --> 02:06:01.790
But you want your valley to be lower in your piece to keep getting higher value

2343
02:06:01.800 --> 02:06:04.860
low,
keep getting higher.
And the way to do that as through your recovery,

2344
02:06:04.861 --> 02:06:07.050
which is gonna help your testosterone production and your growth hormone

2345
02:06:07.051 --> 02:06:10.390
production when you're sleeping,
as well as my segmentation,
um,

2346
02:06:10.440 --> 02:06:14.280
what Immunos I'm taking and why and when I'm taking them.
Um,
you know,

2347
02:06:14.281 --> 02:06:18.060
the Arginine,
the 21,
blended Aminos like,
oh,
I'll take them all different times.

2348
02:06:18.110 --> 02:06:22.230
Um,
when did take them a usually three times a day.

2349
02:06:22.970 --> 02:06:24.320
Um,
sometimes I'll,

2350
02:06:24.330 --> 02:06:26.580
I'll take certain things at nights and things in the morning depending on what

2351
02:06:26.581 --> 02:06:28.650
it's supposed to do for me.
Like my,
my,
um,

2352
02:06:29.810 --> 02:06:34.380
ornithine my glycine and my trip to fan.
I take at night for,

2353
02:06:34.381 --> 02:06:36.930
I go to bed because it was helping my,
it just all show my growth hormone boost.

2354
02:06:36.990 --> 02:06:41.340
Um,
things will take during the day because it's better for my energy system,
ITB,

2355
02:06:41.341 --> 02:06:46.290
production.
Um,
uh,
yeah.
So he's just got all this mapped out for you.

2356
02:06:46.410 --> 02:06:48.660
The man.
That's amazing.
Yeah.
He's,

2357
02:06:49.080 --> 02:06:51.030
how many people could he possibly do that for though?

2358
02:06:51.210 --> 02:06:53.400
He would have to teach at the coaches to do it.
You know,

2359
02:06:53.610 --> 02:06:56.400
he'd have to be like a mentor ship or coaches would come in and they would train

2360
02:06:56.401 --> 02:07:00.780
on or anything,
you know,
and then hopefully stay with us.
Yes.
That's the thing.

2361
02:07:00.781 --> 02:07:01.800
Like if you teach someone too much,

2362
02:07:01.801 --> 02:07:03.960
they can go do whatever they want and they can have this,
the science.

2363
02:07:03.961 --> 02:07:07.610
Eventually it will get out to where you know you're going to see the test,

2364
02:07:07.640 --> 02:07:09.840
you know what you're going to see what he's doing and people are going to want

2365
02:07:09.841 --> 02:07:12.720
to come and learn how to do it.
And for heart rate,
very,
very ability.

2366
02:07:12.721 --> 02:07:17.490
Do you sleep with a chest strap and a wrist watch that the registers are,

2367
02:07:17.491 --> 02:07:18.720
they don't have to have the wristwatch on,

2368
02:07:18.721 --> 02:07:20.780
but as long as it's close enough to register your heartstrings,

2369
02:07:20.880 --> 02:07:23.000
what are you using?
Which,
which one?
Um,

2370
02:07:23.460 --> 02:07:27.710
you seem tone or was it Suunto so I'm done.
Santo.
Yeah.
Okay.
That's a,

2371
02:07:27.720 --> 02:07:31.610
they make hunting watches as well.
They make awesome honey watch is the best.

2372
02:07:31.620 --> 02:07:34.890
Yeah.
Like gps trackers,
everything.
I use one of those.
Yeah,
those are,

2373
02:07:35.230 --> 02:07:37.390
and then so what do you do?

2374
02:07:37.391 --> 02:07:39.970
Do you take the data from that and you put it on a PC?

2375
02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:44.110
Like he's got an algorithm?
Um,
it's why,
yeah,
it went from that.

2376
02:07:44.140 --> 02:07:46.690
I can say my washing is connected to my phone.
Okay.

2377
02:07:46.691 --> 02:07:50.770
And then Sam is logged in to watch is physically connected to your phone or

2378
02:07:50.830 --> 02:07:53.800
through an APP?
Through Bluetooth's snap.
Yeah.
So,
the um,

2379
02:07:53.950 --> 02:07:55.870
so the APP shows you yeah,

2380
02:07:55.871 --> 02:07:59.290
the APP I can put in my information and it sends it straight to Sam's computer.

2381
02:07:59.291 --> 02:08:02.770
So every morning he checks in the morning,
he logs in and gets your data mine,

2382
02:08:02.800 --> 02:08:05.260
he's got a list of people that he checks,
you know,

2383
02:08:05.261 --> 02:08:07.420
and depending on where they're at right now,
I'm not doing it.

2384
02:08:07.450 --> 02:08:10.330
Obviously I don't need to just track my recovery.
But when I'm in camp,

2385
02:08:10.331 --> 02:08:13.330
he's tracking my recovery and he'll let me in the know in the morning,
like,

2386
02:08:13.331 --> 02:08:17.860
look man,
you're 84% recovered this,
pick it up or you're 20%,

2387
02:08:17.861 --> 02:08:22.060
you need to chill.
You know,
and like you'll decide,
so my,
my,
my week to week,

2388
02:08:22.061 --> 02:08:24.610
you have an idea what is going to be,
but it always changes.

2389
02:08:24.940 --> 02:08:28.630
How many times do you think on these days where you looked at the results and

2390
02:08:28.631 --> 02:08:31.210
said,
okay,
I'm taking the day off.
Would you have just said,

2391
02:08:31.211 --> 02:08:34.540
don't be a pussy and push through this shit?
Oh yeah,
I would have easily,
I mean,

2392
02:08:34.541 --> 02:08:37.750
I don't feel that bad,
but then the next,
my next training practice like,
damn,

2393
02:08:37.751 --> 02:08:40.750
I fucking feel good.
I'm primed,
ready to go.
You know?

2394
02:08:40.751 --> 02:08:45.740
And so is it hard to do that to let us take your foot off the gas?
I,
I've always,

2395
02:08:45.790 --> 02:08:48.310
even in the past when I've read a lot of my body and didn't know the science had

2396
02:08:48.311 --> 02:08:51.310
been had to pull back,
but now that I know it,
it's,

2397
02:08:51.760 --> 02:08:54.280
it makes it easier for me to do it,
but it's still very hard.

2398
02:08:54.440 --> 02:08:57.530
It's still very hard to not do more,
not do more.
Yeah.

2399
02:08:57.670 --> 02:09:00.730
But Dad's taught me work your fucking ass off.
Working hard,
work hard.

2400
02:09:00.760 --> 02:09:04.150
Work harder than the next guy,
you know?
But work hard when you work in,

2401
02:09:04.520 --> 02:09:08.650
but no one did not work.
Yes.
I think that applies to life too.
I really do.

2402
02:09:08.680 --> 02:09:12.070
I think you could just burn it out all the time.
Just like I was saying,

2403
02:09:12.071 --> 02:09:14.800
if like it was your sole focus was fighting,
I would burn myself out.

2404
02:09:15.250 --> 02:09:16.640
I have to have these escapes.

2405
02:09:17.500 --> 02:09:19.870
I have to be able to do other things out to enjoy family time.

2406
02:09:19.870 --> 02:09:23.080
I have to go golfing,
I have to go hunting,
I have to get on the lake.

2407
02:09:24.160 --> 02:09:26.050
And even during fight camp,
so I have,

2408
02:09:26.880 --> 02:09:30.220
I used to be like fight camp was fight camp.
That's all I did.
Right.

2409
02:09:30.221 --> 02:09:32.380
But now going with Sam and having these days off,

2410
02:09:32.381 --> 02:09:34.390
I get to spend more family time.
I get to actually do shit.

2411
02:09:34.391 --> 02:09:35.320
I like on certain days,

2412
02:09:35.321 --> 02:09:38.470
like I have two days off a week and we spread them out at different times.

2413
02:09:39.070 --> 02:09:41.410
Sometimes I might have three centers that might have more to me if from getting

2414
02:09:41.411 --> 02:09:45.400
sick or if I'm overworked.
But um,
I guess you get to go do shit.

2415
02:09:45.460 --> 02:09:49.540
I get to go wake board,
you know.
That's nice.
Yeah.
Now,
um,

2416
02:09:49.840 --> 02:09:53.050
is there anything else that he's got you doing?
It's weird that we haven't,

2417
02:09:53.140 --> 02:09:57.910
like you doing any east him,
are you doing anything?
I mean it's always changing.

2418
02:09:57.910 --> 02:10:02.230
We're getting really big into like the extra um,
recovery stuff.
The cryo is the,

2419
02:10:02.231 --> 02:10:06.910
um,
the light therapy,
the [inaudible] machines,
the,
oh,

2420
02:10:06.911 --> 02:10:11.290
excuse me,
hyperbaric chambers.
Um,
when to do them and how to,

2421
02:10:11.350 --> 02:10:13.930
how to test everything.
Everyone has always known that are good for you,

2422
02:10:13.931 --> 02:10:16.810
but I don't feel like there's been the exact numbers behind it and now he's

2423
02:10:16.811 --> 02:10:20.260
going to track it kind of thing.
So we're getting more into that realm of it.
Um,

2424
02:10:20.261 --> 02:10:23.860
I use an alto lab that helps with me getting my hypoxic state to do altitude

2425
02:10:23.861 --> 02:10:28.570
training,
um,
to where I'm breathing in that for an hour a day.
Uh,
and that's,

2426
02:10:28.571 --> 02:10:31.290
you know,
I'm going anywhere to like 40,000 feet,
you know,

2427
02:10:31.330 --> 02:10:34.370
but there's only like certain like blanks you could do it for.

2428
02:10:34.670 --> 02:10:37.280
Then you have to take,
like for instance,
like doing like six minutes on,

2429
02:10:37.281 --> 02:10:39.680
five minutes off or three minutes on three,
like in,

2430
02:10:39.681 --> 02:10:43.340
in tracking what my body's doing the next day.
Um,
what else we're doing.

2431
02:10:43.341 --> 02:10:47.540
Obviously my diet supplementation we talked about,
I mean,

2432
02:10:47.660 --> 02:10:51.710
just a crazy workout stuff he's got us doing too,
you know?
Um,
like I said,

2433
02:10:51.711 --> 02:10:53.660
it's kind of like rocky training.
Um,

2434
02:10:53.690 --> 02:10:58.690
but it's a shit ton of core work and his warmup is not a warm of his warm of is

2435
02:10:59.031 --> 02:11:00.200
usually everyone else's workout.

2436
02:11:00.201 --> 02:11:03.140
He's pushing us to our lactate threshold to where like you want to throw up,

2437
02:11:03.141 --> 02:11:06.410
you're done.
And then we're doing muscular endurance,
you know,

2438
02:11:06.411 --> 02:11:10.130
so we're not doing any kind of strengthening and I've pushed that limit so maybe

2439
02:11:10.131 --> 02:11:11.630
I've hit hard ground and pound.

2440
02:11:11.631 --> 02:11:13.700
You know when you stand up and you have muscle pump and you can't go,

2441
02:11:14.120 --> 02:11:16.160
you don't have that anymore because you're used to,

2442
02:11:16.190 --> 02:11:20.560
your lactate threshold is higher now.
So Ah,
if my lactate there,

2443
02:11:20.561 --> 02:11:21.530
she's the oldest higher than,

2444
02:11:21.531 --> 02:11:25.310
I'm not going to be able to push myself to where I have that,
that pump,
you know?

2445
02:11:25.580 --> 02:11:29.060
And so get to that point so you know what it feels like.
Right.
So mentally,

2446
02:11:29.061 --> 02:11:30.230
if I ever get to that point in a fight,

2447
02:11:30.320 --> 02:11:33.380
I'll know cake cause I've been there as well as when you get there and you work

2448
02:11:33.381 --> 02:11:35.480
out past it s a smart way,

2449
02:11:36.320 --> 02:11:38.540
then it's going to increase your lactate threshold and you're like,

2450
02:11:38.720 --> 02:11:40.220
it'll take you longer to get to that point.

2451
02:11:40.640 --> 02:11:43.580
So when you're doing strength and conditioning work,
you're,

2452
02:11:43.581 --> 02:11:47.510
you're exhausting yourself before you're doing strength work.
Not always,
but yes.

2453
02:11:47.690 --> 02:11:50.540
Yeah.
So some workouts aren't as hard as others,
but yeah,

2454
02:11:50.541 --> 02:11:53.570
the ones that were like when I said the hardest I've ever worked on my entire

2455
02:11:53.571 --> 02:11:56.120
life was that kind of shit.
Wow.
Yeah.

2456
02:11:56.121 --> 02:11:58.760
To where you think like even especially like when I first started doing it,

2457
02:11:58.761 --> 02:12:01.830
but all right,
nice.
A good workout.
You good job.
All right,
one more silver.

2458
02:12:01.831 --> 02:12:03.740
Let's hit that was hit the garage.
We're lifting,
you know,

2459
02:12:04.070 --> 02:12:06.970
or we're hitting the pool.
We're swimming.
So yeah,

2460
02:12:07.520 --> 02:12:10.820
to him he's reason tough dude.
But now my girl does called me.

2461
02:12:10.821 --> 02:12:11.900
I needed to go with coach Sam

2462
02:12:15.780 --> 02:12:19.010
saying your Yak,
I know it was,

2463
02:12:19.160 --> 02:12:22.010
I know a stringy fishing day and I always pull up and like I see the stop sign

2464
02:12:22.011 --> 02:12:23.720
right before I turned left to get to his house.
I'm like fuck,

2465
02:12:23.721 --> 02:12:28.140
I could just keep going.
I don't have to turn left.
I don't have to.

2466
02:12:29.690 --> 02:12:33.080
But if you're in the garage and you continue to come back,
you're a Sicko.

2467
02:12:33.610 --> 02:12:34.760
You like this shit.
Now,

2468
02:12:34.761 --> 02:12:39.140
how do you organize that strength and conditioning days and what precedent?

2469
02:12:39.170 --> 02:12:42.710
Like how,
what importance is strength and conditioning takeover skill work.

2470
02:12:42.890 --> 02:12:44.480
Like how do you organize that?

2471
02:12:45.440 --> 02:12:47.990
That's something that I still is always going have to be developed depending on

2472
02:12:48.080 --> 02:12:50.120
person to person who needs more skill.
Right.

2473
02:12:50.600 --> 02:12:54.540
And who's obviously you never have it completely,
but um,

2474
02:12:54.560 --> 02:12:56.120
some people will need more skill training than others.

2475
02:12:56.121 --> 02:12:58.250
And if you're getting in there,
like when I first started him in May,

2476
02:12:58.310 --> 02:13:00.680
I probably should've done string conditioning for a year and a half.

2477
02:13:00.681 --> 02:13:03.480
I should only done skill cause I needed to catch up.
Um,

2478
02:13:03.500 --> 02:13:07.160
but I'm to the point now where each camp changes with technique and I've seen

2479
02:13:07.170 --> 02:13:09.590
going to continue to grow and that's why my camps are so long.

2480
02:13:10.020 --> 02:13:14.480
I called do more skill outside of camp time and more getting my body ready.

2481
02:13:15.380 --> 02:13:18.830
I don't know if I'm answering your question,
but when you are,
um,
it's just,

2482
02:13:18.980 --> 02:13:22.790
it always changes.
You don't want to burn yourself out that hard and then spar,

2483
02:13:22.820 --> 02:13:25.910
that's still something that I feel like we're even even learning with Sam still

2484
02:13:25.911 --> 02:13:27.310
too.
Like he always,

2485
02:13:27.311 --> 02:13:30.920
he's a wrestler and he knows training and he knows strength conditioning and

2486
02:13:30.921 --> 02:13:33.540
that's,
we listen to our heart rate and that's why every coach is,

2487
02:13:33.590 --> 02:13:35.850
and that's the thing too,
is it at our team,

2488
02:13:35.880 --> 02:13:38.970
every coach is going to talk to each other.
They're all on the same page.

2489
02:13:39.030 --> 02:13:41.370
We know like they know what days are going to be off.

2490
02:13:41.371 --> 02:13:42.930
Like no one's going to show up to the gym day.
If they do,

2491
02:13:42.960 --> 02:13:45.030
we're going to go light because we pushed it yesterday.

2492
02:13:45.360 --> 02:13:48.300
It's never going to be like distinguishing coach's job is to kill you now.

2493
02:13:48.301 --> 02:13:49.980
You're going to,
in wrestling,
he's going to kill you too.

2494
02:13:50.370 --> 02:13:53.970
Like we're all on the same schedule so that we know that may when days are our

2495
02:13:53.971 --> 02:13:57.180
active recovery.
So if you're going to go into practice,
you're just drilling,

2496
02:13:57.181 --> 02:14:00.270
you're moving light,
you're not going hard cause you got killed the day before.

2497
02:14:00.900 --> 02:14:04.740
So when you're at your peak is hardest days,
your next day's either off or uh,

2498
02:14:05.130 --> 02:14:09.570
an active rest day.
Do Yoga,
go do some yoga,
get your mind off it,
you know.

2499
02:14:10.080 --> 02:14:13.890
And does he have your weeks planned out in advance or does he doing it day to

2500
02:14:13.891 --> 02:14:18.240
day or how was he when,
when do you know what you're going to be doing?

2501
02:14:18.570 --> 02:14:20.360
Um,
I don't know,
but he,
you know,

2502
02:14:20.370 --> 02:14:24.930
he plans out everything in advance and I'll be the whole camp my whole life.

2503
02:14:25.370 --> 02:14:27.780
I have camp does it dude?
He's like my life coach man.

2504
02:14:27.781 --> 02:14:30.540
Like even after this fight is like,
all right,
it was not changing the Diet.

2505
02:14:30.750 --> 02:14:32.190
I don't want just rice is coming back.

2506
02:14:32.191 --> 02:14:34.440
I don't want to have to work from ground zero.
I want to like stay this,

2507
02:14:34.441 --> 02:14:37.680
we can keep building.
Um,
so he's like my life coach and all like,

2508
02:14:37.690 --> 02:14:41.290
I feel like I'm cheating on him when I'm eating a cheeseburger with Don's on it,

2509
02:14:41.300 --> 02:14:44.580
you know?
But it's funny,
he's got the whole camp planned out.

2510
02:14:44.610 --> 02:14:49.140
My whole continuing to grow and obviously it will vary depending on my recovery.

2511
02:14:49.650 --> 02:14:53.250
Now with this ESPN deal,
I know they're planning on some pretty big events.
Right.

2512
02:14:53.390 --> 02:14:57.390
Did they,
have they talked to you about finding on ESPN?
Not yet.
No.
I mean,

2513
02:14:57.391 --> 02:15:00.790
obviously being a champion want to be pay per view though.
Yeah,
right.

2514
02:15:00.810 --> 02:15:03.960
That's where the kids ashes at.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean,

2515
02:15:03.961 --> 02:15:06.660
that's where it comes down to you actually,
you're,
you're betting on yourself.

2516
02:15:06.661 --> 02:15:11.040
You know,
when you're fight live TV,
it's,
it's,
it's,
you get a lot of viewers,

2517
02:15:11.041 --> 02:15:13.500
you build your name right.
But when you have these paper views,
you're,

2518
02:15:13.530 --> 02:15:16.200
you're betting on that.
People want to watch you because you're,
you,
you know,

2519
02:15:16.230 --> 02:15:20.760
and uh,
I've just continued to fight my fucking ass off and go ham,
you know,

2520
02:15:20.761 --> 02:15:21.600
I was going to be my style.

2521
02:15:21.601 --> 02:15:24.920
I'm always going to go pedal to the metal when I fight looking for knockouts

2522
02:15:24.930 --> 02:15:28.530
because that's my entertaining.
That's how I'm entertaining.
Like,
yeah,
sure.

2523
02:15:28.531 --> 02:15:32.130
I'll maybe talk confidence and talk trash.
I'm gonna fuck you up,
you know,

2524
02:15:32.131 --> 02:15:35.760
but I'm not going to go out and be the,
the um,
Colbys you know,

2525
02:15:35.761 --> 02:15:39.330
I'm not going to go crazy because my personality,
I want to be able to,
I mean,

2526
02:15:39.331 --> 02:15:41.580
I know it's fun.
It's awesome.
We like those guys,
but I want to be,

2527
02:15:41.590 --> 02:15:44.610
to look back on my career and like show my kid like,
look,
that's who I was.
Like,

2528
02:15:44.611 --> 02:15:48.030
I fucking stay myself.
I stay much true color.
I'm an open fucking book.

2529
02:15:48.031 --> 02:15:49.860
I tell them whatever it is,
you know,

2530
02:15:49.861 --> 02:15:52.080
but I want it to be like the chocolate l days.

2531
02:15:52.081 --> 02:15:55.540
You step out there and fucking knock someone out.
You get love for it.
You know,

2532
02:15:55.860 --> 02:15:59.370
like the real kind of gladiator shit.
Well,
it's definitely building for you now,

2533
02:15:59.400 --> 02:15:59.761
you know,

2534
02:15:59.761 --> 02:16:03.720
I mean there was a lot of negative energy that was coming your way when you left

2535
02:16:03.721 --> 02:16:07.110
Alpha male and when you are on the ultimate fighter,

2536
02:16:07.111 --> 02:16:08.610
there was some negative shit that was coming your way.

2537
02:16:08.611 --> 02:16:10.200
But it seems like with every victory,

2538
02:16:10.470 --> 02:16:12.810
like all that stuff's going behind you and now,

2539
02:16:12.930 --> 02:16:17.430
now it's really obvious you made the right choice and Cody out twice in a row.

2540
02:16:17.840 --> 02:16:22.030
Yeah,
I didn't want to do the ultimate fighter.
They asked me,
he's like,
Hey,
oh.

2541
02:16:22.110 --> 02:16:23.670
So I was like,
I want my fucking title fight.

2542
02:16:23.671 --> 02:16:25.020
Like I'm going to need it for a while.
You know,

2543
02:16:25.021 --> 02:16:27.450
I've been begging for it and then obviously they're going to give me Cody,

2544
02:16:27.451 --> 02:16:29.890
but like,
hey,
we want you to coach Holtmann fighter.
I was like,
fuck,

2545
02:16:29.891 --> 02:16:31.480
of course I got to go.
Coach gets Alpha male.

2546
02:16:31.481 --> 02:16:33.280
It's like the last thing I want to do.

2547
02:16:33.281 --> 02:16:36.520
I knew all this shit was going to be fucking crazy.
Um,

2548
02:16:36.580 --> 02:16:37.540
and so I didn't want to do it,

2549
02:16:37.541 --> 02:16:40.360
but I wasn't going to say no because that's my thing.
I shot at the title,

2550
02:16:40.361 --> 02:16:45.250
you know,
and uh,
I'm fucking so glad I did it cause I got to show my true colors.

2551
02:16:45.251 --> 02:16:46.760
I get to show how much I care about this war,

2552
02:16:46.761 --> 02:16:48.070
how much I got to be a martial artist,

2553
02:16:48.340 --> 02:16:52.240
teach the way that me and Dwayne kind of do things very professional.
Um,

2554
02:16:52.270 --> 02:16:55.390
let them be fucking assholes and then come around and have it bite him in the

2555
02:16:55.391 --> 02:16:56.950
ass,
you know,
like it,

2556
02:16:57.180 --> 02:17:01.630
it worked out perfect for me because we got to show it really is,
is what,

2557
02:17:02.470 --> 02:17:04.600
sorry.
No,
go for it.
It was a good opportunity to,

2558
02:17:04.660 --> 02:17:07.630
it was a good opportunity to showcase how to handle those situations.

2559
02:17:07.900 --> 02:17:11.560
You get to be your own judge.
The more evidence you have in front of you,

2560
02:17:11.561 --> 02:17:14.530
you get to be your own judge of what actually happened rather than Uriah and

2561
02:17:14.531 --> 02:17:17.580
Cody running their fucking mouth of,
of me leaving,
me being a trader,

2562
02:17:17.610 --> 02:17:21.490
me doing this,
me taking PDDs compared to what's actually going down.

2563
02:17:21.520 --> 02:17:26.410
You know what I mean?
Like you get to be the judge yourself on who I am,

2564
02:17:26.950 --> 02:17:28.300
you know?
So the more you get to know,

2565
02:17:28.301 --> 02:17:30.820
I mean that's why she'll look at the more you get to find out about me,

2566
02:17:30.821 --> 02:17:35.410
the more you get to know me.
Did you and Cody talk after the fight at all?
No.
No.

2567
02:17:35.530 --> 02:17:38.650
I mean I shouldn't show respect to them and like I never had a problem with Cody

2568
02:17:38.651 --> 02:17:39.484
when we were at [inaudible].

2569
02:17:39.730 --> 02:17:43.870
I felt like I kind of feel bad for the guy because this wasn't any of his drama.

2570
02:17:44.200 --> 02:17:46.720
You know,
like he was coming to the team when I was kind of on my way out.

2571
02:17:46.750 --> 02:17:48.750
You know,
he just started,
I was holding it for him.

2572
02:17:48.751 --> 02:17:51.610
He just got into the UFC cause we didn't have a coach because Dwayne left.
Right.

2573
02:17:51.611 --> 02:17:55.060
So I'm,
I'm running the kickboxing classes.
Dwayne left,

2574
02:17:55.120 --> 02:17:57.850
I'm the only one left there to coach practices I'm holding mitts from and stuff

2575
02:17:57.851 --> 02:17:59.290
like that.
Um,

2576
02:17:59.350 --> 02:18:02.680
and then I get the ultimatum and I leave and then he becomes champion.

2577
02:18:02.681 --> 02:18:05.470
Now it's like all this pressure from Uriah team,

2578
02:18:05.471 --> 02:18:08.800
Alpha male to talk shit and us be the rivals.
Him was weighed on his shoulders.

2579
02:18:08.801 --> 02:18:10.210
I mean,
that fucking sucks.
I mean,

2580
02:18:10.540 --> 02:18:14.140
I feel like that's a big flag to have to carry rather than just carry your own

2581
02:18:14.141 --> 02:18:16.810
flag.
Carrie,
Carrie,
what you care about?

2582
02:18:16.811 --> 02:18:18.950
Carry your own fucking flag instead of like,
damn,

2583
02:18:18.951 --> 02:18:23.710
I got all my team that are all my back.
Like that's a lot of pressure,
you know?

2584
02:18:24.250 --> 02:18:24.611
Yeah.

2585
02:18:24.611 --> 02:18:28.870
I think for him he really felt like that team and that family environment is

2586
02:18:28.871 --> 02:18:32.440
what he needed.
That it really,
you mean he said Alpha male saved his life.

2587
02:18:32.500 --> 02:18:34.030
It meant a lot to him.
Yeah.

2588
02:18:34.720 --> 02:18:37.810
He should have thought that martial arts saved your life.
You know what I mean?

2589
02:18:38.110 --> 02:18:40.290
Like yeah,
the team,
it's,
it's awesome having a team is having it.

2590
02:18:40.310 --> 02:18:42.970
Like even like we have a team now I say be individualized,

2591
02:18:42.971 --> 02:18:46.270
but it's really good to have a team because you guys are going through the same

2592
02:18:46.271 --> 02:18:49.090
shit together.
It's good to have friends that are doing the same shit.

2593
02:18:49.091 --> 02:18:53.890
Like I can't only have average Joe friends because they don't know what it is to

2594
02:18:53.891 --> 02:18:58.060
be me.
They don't know what,
what should I have to do to be the world champion.

2595
02:18:58.061 --> 02:19:00.370
So it's good to have those guys around you.
Um,

2596
02:19:00.400 --> 02:19:03.220
but really you got to know that martial arts is what's going to steer you in the

2597
02:19:03.221 --> 02:19:05.280
right direction.
If I wouldn't had wrestling,
if I wonder,

2598
02:19:05.300 --> 02:19:09.010
went to college with wrestling,
I would've fucking fuck shit up.
You know?

2599
02:19:09.011 --> 02:19:10.180
I just had that personality.

2600
02:19:10.181 --> 02:19:13.210
Like I'm really glad that wrestling kept me grounded and then getting into

2601
02:19:13.211 --> 02:19:16.330
martial arts and I'm a very addictive person.
I mean,

2602
02:19:16.331 --> 02:19:18.310
who knows what I'd be addicted to if it wasn't martial arts.

2603
02:19:18.311 --> 02:19:22.360
I'm exactly the same way.
At least I,
I found the right things to be addicted to.

2604
02:19:22.420 --> 02:19:24.190
I think that's important for so many kids.

2605
02:19:24.191 --> 02:19:26.590
I think there's so many young kids that are growing up and they have all this

2606
02:19:26.591 --> 02:19:28.070
anxious and you know,

2607
02:19:28.070 --> 02:19:28.890
<v 3>they're,
they're,
they just,</v>

2608
02:19:28.890 --> 02:19:32.780
their bodies are anxious and they're filled with fucking testosterone and they

2609
02:19:32.781 --> 02:19:34.760
just,
yeah,
the kids want to break things.

2610
02:19:34.761 --> 02:19:39.260
I think if you could focus that into wrestling or giving them Rhydlin yeah,

2611
02:19:39.290 --> 02:19:42.740
let him wrestle.
Just any kind of martial arts,
Jujitsu,
something.

2612
02:19:42.741 --> 02:19:47.741
It's just so good for their self esteem and for this d relieving that excess

2613
02:19:48.201 --> 02:19:52.100
energy allows them to see more clearly think things through better.

2614
02:19:52.420 --> 02:19:53.630
It's just so good for them.

2615
02:19:53.631 --> 02:19:57.650
And unfortunately you're seeing less and less of that with people today.

2616
02:19:57.651 --> 02:20:00.620
There's less and less martial arts and people's lives.

2617
02:20:00.760 --> 02:20:03.920
<v 2>So I make a bunch of free videos and just lead by example.
You know,</v>

2618
02:20:03.921 --> 02:20:06.780
like you asked me if I still train.
Yeah.
Hell yeah.
I do like I love this.
And,

2619
02:20:07.020 --> 02:20:11.270
and again,
bunch of free video seminar can find,
you can find march,

2620
02:20:11.280 --> 02:20:13.670
like it's easier to access of martial arts right now.

2621
02:20:13.671 --> 02:20:15.860
Like Dwayne's Dwayne's online academy for instance.

2622
02:20:15.861 --> 02:20:19.460
Like you can get technique 24,
seven,
go do it in your garage with your buddy.

2623
02:20:19.461 --> 02:20:23.330
You don't hit a punching bag,
right.
Learn Jujitsu online.
Like,
you know,

2624
02:20:23.331 --> 02:20:26.420
I'm starting not even like the physical fitness part of training and I'm

2625
02:20:26.421 --> 02:20:29.060
starting my own,
um,
my own academy as well.

2626
02:20:29.061 --> 02:20:31.910
Online trauma to teaching not only the techniques behind it,

2627
02:20:31.911 --> 02:20:34.670
but how I get stronger at doing them,
how I get in better shape,

2628
02:20:34.671 --> 02:20:37.850
like a physical fitness part of it as well.
And is not going to be available.
Uh,

2629
02:20:37.880 --> 02:20:42.680
probably s less than a month,
hopefully.
Beautiful.
Yeah.

2630
02:20:43.350 --> 02:20:44.990
Hell yeah man.
Beautiful.
It'll be,
I mean,

2631
02:20:44.991 --> 02:20:48.530
you can get more information on it now just on Tj dillashaw.com.
Um,
but yeah,

2632
02:20:48.531 --> 02:20:52.850
I'm going to start an online kind of,
I'm actually meeting Dwayne,

2633
02:20:52.851 --> 02:20:57.380
not only coach me in the technique of martial arts,
but you know,

2634
02:20:57.381 --> 02:21:00.410
the way he's organized everything,
how he's learned from boss,
how to organize,

2635
02:21:00.411 --> 02:21:04.550
how to create a system.
I've kind of done the same thing,
you know.
Um,
I've,

2636
02:21:04.551 --> 02:21:07.940
I've not only widget the technique,
but the lifestyle,
you know,
it's,

2637
02:21:08.020 --> 02:21:10.190
I'm kind of running with that and running with that and I want to show me,

2638
02:21:10.191 --> 02:21:10.910
I'm not going to,

2639
02:21:10.910 --> 02:21:12.890
because eventually I'm not going to hold back and have any secrets.

2640
02:21:12.891 --> 02:21:15.980
I'm going to tell everyone everything you know,
and I want to start a champ camp.

2641
02:21:15.981 --> 02:21:20.090
I want to do like a very exclusive champ camp where it's like only 10 people can

2642
02:21:20.091 --> 02:21:24.110
come and you come and stay with me,
live at my house in Colorado,
go wakeboarding.

2643
02:21:24.110 --> 02:21:26.270
But then we also learned like the mental aspect of how I be,

2644
02:21:26.480 --> 02:21:28.430
how I think to be a champion,
how I eat,

2645
02:21:28.700 --> 02:21:33.320
how the techniques taking him to doing shim like and I want to cause like so we

2646
02:21:33.321 --> 02:21:34.760
need to do is lead by example,
right?

2647
02:21:34.761 --> 02:21:37.400
Help out because then I can really feel like I can like let loose.

2648
02:21:37.490 --> 02:21:40.880
I can tell you everything to where like I don't want to sit to tell everyone

2649
02:21:40.881 --> 02:21:42.710
everything cause I'm giving away my secrets.
That's who I am.

2650
02:21:42.711 --> 02:21:44.150
That's why I'm the best in the world.

2651
02:21:44.450 --> 02:21:48.800
But I loved to teach and I love to do it and I feel like by giving them small

2652
02:21:48.801 --> 02:21:50.690
like small groups and give him some intimate time,

2653
02:21:50.691 --> 02:21:53.720
doing a real champ camp is something I want to do as well.

2654
02:21:53.721 --> 02:21:55.910
And I want to start creating as an art critic and places where we can have some

2655
02:21:55.911 --> 02:21:58.610
fun too.
Cause I think fighting,
you got to have fun in this thing.

2656
02:21:58.611 --> 02:22:00.230
Like you were talking to Donald Serone,
uh,

2657
02:22:00.260 --> 02:22:03.980
not too long ago and that guy has to have fun.
If he's too much into the,

2658
02:22:04.040 --> 02:22:07.370
like the professionals of I'm just fighting,
then he's going to fall apart,

2659
02:22:07.390 --> 02:22:08.310
you know?
Um,

2660
02:22:08.380 --> 02:22:11.570
and so I want to teach you that I do that shit or my recovery serious like my

2661
02:22:11.571 --> 02:22:15.470
nutrition serious,
