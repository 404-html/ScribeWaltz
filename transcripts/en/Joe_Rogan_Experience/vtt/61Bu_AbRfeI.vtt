00:00:57.601 --> 00:00:58.411

<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

32
00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.630
<v Speaker 1>That's the one of those old school places.</v>

33
00:01:00.631 --> 00:01:03.840
<v Speaker 1>I think they've been open for 30 years now or something crazy.</v>

34
00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:04.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

35
00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.040
<v Speaker 1>they've uh,</v>

36
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:05.790
<v Speaker 1>they've been opened over,</v>

37
00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:06.330
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

38
00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.620
<v Speaker 1>don't they claim to be the oldest?</v>

39
00:01:07.621 --> 00:01:08.454
<v Speaker 1>How many classes?</v>

40
00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:09.780
<v Speaker 1>I think they might be,</v>

41
00:01:09.781 --> 00:01:10.580
<v Speaker 1>it's them and light.</v>

42
00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.110
<v Speaker 1>Then the comedy and Magic Club is regret up in there too.</v>

43
00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

44
00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:14.730
<v Speaker 1>And then the store I think,</v>

45
00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.140
<v Speaker 1>but if you go there,</v>

46
00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:18.570
<v Speaker 1>it's one of those places that has like,</v>

47
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.750
<v Speaker 1>it's a like a fucking comedy museum as well as a standup comic clearly.</v>

48
00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.951
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>

49
00:01:22.951 --> 00:01:23.671
<v Speaker 1>That's the coolest part.</v>

50
00:01:23.671 --> 00:01:23.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

51
00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.810
<v Speaker 1>because you're walking around and you see headshots from like the 70s man,</v>

52
00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:30.890
<v Speaker 1>the head shots when the ATS tracks.</v>

53
00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.993
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

54
00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.000
<v Speaker 1>I saw a David Letterman and contract last time I was there and his social</v>

55
00:01:36.001 --> 00:01:37.590
<v Speaker 1>security numbers on it,</v>

56
00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.080
<v Speaker 1>but it'll cover like by the frame and I'm like,</v>

57
00:01:40.081 --> 00:01:40.321
<v Speaker 1>damn,</v>

58
00:01:40.321 --> 00:01:43.530
<v Speaker 1>if you really wanted David Letterman social security now or you would just steal</v>

59
00:01:43.531 --> 00:01:45.930
<v Speaker 1>this picture and break that frame you just gave somebody.</v>

60
00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.770
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>

61
00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:47.750
<v Speaker 1>why did you get some back?</v>

62
00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.880
<v Speaker 1>Did you bring that up to us before the podcast?</v>

63
00:01:50.881 --> 00:01:51.301

<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

65
00:01:51.511 --> 00:01:52.950
<v Speaker 1>maybe we shouldn't talk about that on the air.</v>

66
00:01:52.951 --> 00:01:53.400
<v Speaker 1>And you go,</v>

00:01:54.331 --> 00:01:56.000
<v Speaker 1>Well you got to talk to the Ice House.</v>

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.170
<v Speaker 1>I'll be there tomorrow night.</v>

71
00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.341

00:02:01.651 --> 00:02:02.850
<v Speaker 1>They didn't alternate it at all.</v>

75
00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:03.450
<v Speaker 1>They didn't,</v>

76
00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.160
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

77
00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.440
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

78
00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:05.100
<v Speaker 1>they might have,</v>

79
00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.600
<v Speaker 1>but I was looking at it and I was like,</v>

80
00:02:06.601 --> 00:02:07.081
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit,</v>

81
00:02:07.081 --> 00:02:08.340
<v Speaker 1>why is that just sitting there?</v>

82
00:02:08.341 --> 00:02:08.670
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

83
00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:09.120
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

84
00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.070
<v Speaker 1>that seems like they would know that by now,</v>

85
00:02:11.071 --> 00:02:11.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

86
00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:12.503
<v Speaker 1>it has to be altered.</v>

87
00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:13.560
<v Speaker 1>I must be altered,</v>

88
00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:14.453
<v Speaker 1>I would assume.</v>

89
00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.020
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully Jesus Christ,</v>

90
00:02:16.021 --> 00:02:18.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm just a crook looking at a fucking headshots and I'm like,</v>

91
00:02:18.211 --> 00:02:18.810
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>

92
00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.580
<v Speaker 1>They busted a bunch of those anonymous cats,</v>

93
00:02:20.581 --> 00:02:20.940
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

94
00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:21.301
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

95
00:02:21.301 --> 00:02:22.134
<v Speaker 1>Shitload of them.</v>

96
00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:23.550
<v Speaker 1>Some in California too.</v>

97
00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.230
<v Speaker 1>And what do they charge them with?</v>

98
00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.551
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

99
00:02:26.551 --> 00:02:28.640
<v Speaker 1>That's like cyber terrorism or something like that.</v>

100
00:02:28.641 --> 00:02:28.810
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>

101
00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:29.220
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

102
00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.550
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

103
00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.861
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

104
00:02:29.861 --> 00:02:30.840
<v Speaker 1>that's hardcore federal.</v>

105
00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:32.880
<v Speaker 1>What did they do exactly?</v>

106
00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.280
<v Speaker 1>I know they went after companies that thought were bad and they hacked pay</v>

107
00:02:37.281 --> 00:02:37.651
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>

108
00:02:37.651 --> 00:02:38.371
<v Speaker 1>I think they did.</v>

109
00:02:38.371 --> 00:02:41.100
<v Speaker 1>Or they fucked with paypal somehow and I can't remember.</v>

110
00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.810
<v Speaker 1>And they like started taking people's pay pals and like buying things on Amazon.</v>

111
00:02:45.811 --> 00:02:46.120
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

112
00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.310
<v Speaker 1>but it was all fun stuff.</v>

113
00:02:47.311 --> 00:02:50.620
<v Speaker 1>Like they would buy like diapers to the right person or something like that.</v>

114
00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.900
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

115
00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:52.411
<v Speaker 1>things like that.</v>

116
00:02:52.411 --> 00:02:53.970
<v Speaker 1>But it was hacking paypal,</v>

117
00:02:53.971 --> 00:02:56.550
<v Speaker 1>which I guess can be considered like a bank or something like that.</v>

118
00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:57.900
<v Speaker 1>So that would be a federal crime,</v>

119
00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:58.760
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine.</v>

120
00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:59.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

121
00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.921
<v Speaker 1>they're fucked,</v>

122
00:02:59.921 --> 00:03:00.250
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

123
00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

124
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.230
<v Speaker 1>You're getting real trouble for that shit now.</v>

125
00:03:02.231 --> 00:03:05.050
<v Speaker 1>I guess cybercrime is legit now.</v>

126
00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.040
<v Speaker 1>It's like terrorism.</v>

127
00:03:06.041 --> 00:03:08.380
<v Speaker 1>Like remember they used to not have laws for this stuff.</v>

128
00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:11.830
<v Speaker 1>Like cause it didn't like when people would do things like this for the first</v>

129
00:03:11.831 --> 00:03:13.080
<v Speaker 1>time and people would,</v>

130
00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.923
<v Speaker 1>they would get like,</v>

131
00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.680
<v Speaker 1>we don't really have a law yet for breaking into this type of account cause they</v>

132
00:03:18.681 --> 00:03:22.570
<v Speaker 1>didn't know their shit existed so they had to pass all these laws.</v>

133
00:03:22.571 --> 00:03:25.030
<v Speaker 1>We still have to pass laws for new crimes.</v>

134
00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.840
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

135
00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.200
<v Speaker 1>Technology allows for new crimes that take place.</v>

136
00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

137
00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:30.550
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

138
00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.761
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

139
00:03:30.761 --> 00:03:32.140
<v Speaker 1>Crimes that didn't exist before.</v>

140
00:03:32.141 --> 00:03:34.030
<v Speaker 1>They weren't possible for you.</v>

141
00:03:34.031 --> 00:03:38.020
<v Speaker 1>Remember when they first started using those things over the phone when they</v>

142
00:03:38.021 --> 00:03:42.280
<v Speaker 1>would have tones that you could call Andy and use over the phone and it would</v>

143
00:03:42.281 --> 00:03:43.390
<v Speaker 1>like hack the phones.</v>

144
00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:45.000
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck was that?</v>

145
00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

146
00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:46.040
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

147
00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:46.290
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>

148
00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:47.020
<v Speaker 1>how did that work?</v>

149
00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.980
<v Speaker 1>I can't even remember.</v>

150
00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.730
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

151
00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:49.040
<v Speaker 1>I never,</v>

152
00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.980
<v Speaker 1>something you could do to a phone by sending a tone through it and that certain</v>

153
00:03:53.981 --> 00:03:57.160
<v Speaker 1>tone would interact with the machine on the other side.</v>

154
00:03:57.161 --> 00:03:59.230
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know what the fuck that it allowed you to do,</v>

155
00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:01.240
<v Speaker 1>but just the fact that somebody figured that out,</v>

156
00:04:01.241 --> 00:04:01.580
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

157
00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

158
00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:03.340
<v Speaker 1>People are so creepy.</v>

159
00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.840
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

160
00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.070
<v Speaker 1>they'll try to exploit every little,</v>

161
00:04:06.071 --> 00:04:06.371
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

162
00:04:06.371 --> 00:04:06.571
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

163
00:04:06.571 --> 00:04:07.780
<v Speaker 1>and any little system,</v>

164
00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.210
<v Speaker 1>there's gotta be some way to make money off this.</v>

165
00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:11.800
<v Speaker 1>That's why I see somewhere to hack it.</v>

166
00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:14.350
<v Speaker 1>Security never becomes foolproof because yeah,</v>

167
00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.420
<v Speaker 1>when you develop a new security system,</v>

168
00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:18.970
<v Speaker 1>it becomes someone's mission to break that.</v>

169
00:04:18.971 --> 00:04:21.600
<v Speaker 1>So then you just make it as good as it can be and then you have to evolve that.</v>

170
00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:23.650
<v Speaker 1>But you kind of need those guys though,</v>

171
00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.570
<v Speaker 1>because if you don't have those guys,</v>

172
00:04:25.571 --> 00:04:29.410
<v Speaker 1>you don't have any realistic sense of how secure your data is.</v>

173
00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:29.950
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

174
00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:30.221
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

175
00:04:30.221 --> 00:04:32.710
<v Speaker 1>you need some fucking psychos going after your shit,</v>

176
00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.600
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

177
00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.560
<v Speaker 1>If psychos go off to your website,</v>

178
00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:36.430
<v Speaker 1>then you then,</v>

179
00:04:36.431 --> 00:04:36.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

180
00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:37.660
<v Speaker 1>then you know,</v>

181
00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:39.160
<v Speaker 1>because you can't just have your employees.</v>

182
00:04:39.161 --> 00:04:39.520
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

183
00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.860
<v Speaker 1>we're going to test it from the outside and see if we can whack in.</v>

184
00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.340
<v Speaker 1>Nah,</v>

185
00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:43.420
<v Speaker 1>you don't have enough motivation.</v>

186
00:04:43.421 --> 00:04:44.000
<v Speaker 1>Stupid.</v>

187
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

188
00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:45.940
<v Speaker 1>You need to be hating the government.</v>

189
00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:51.030
<v Speaker 1>Did you tweet that article about the guy who is going to prison now for like</v>

190
00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:54.190
<v Speaker 1>life or something for hacking his neighbors?</v>

191
00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:54.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

192
00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.080
<v Speaker 1>he's going for 18 years.</v>

193
00:04:56.081 --> 00:04:56.470
<v Speaker 1>Well this,</v>

194
00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:57.810
<v Speaker 1>he was terrorizing the family.</v>

195
00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:58.810
<v Speaker 1>He is a crazy,</v>

196
00:04:58.811 --> 00:04:59.630
<v Speaker 1>amazing story.</v>

197
00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:00.463
<v Speaker 1>Pharrell story.</v>

198
00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:01.570
<v Speaker 1>You hear shit about that.</v>

199
00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:02.411
<v Speaker 1>It's scary.</v>

200
00:05:02.411 --> 00:05:03.011
<v Speaker 1>Scary story.</v>

201
00:05:03.011 --> 00:05:03.844
<v Speaker 1>We can just do that.</v>

202
00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:04.760
<v Speaker 1>That's terrible.</v>

203
00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:05.840
<v Speaker 3>I think as a business,</v>

204
00:05:05.841 --> 00:05:08.570
<v Speaker 3>the only way to protect herself from like these like hacks,</v>

205
00:05:08.571 --> 00:05:09.980
<v Speaker 3>like anonymous and stuff like that.</v>

206
00:05:09.981 --> 00:05:12.920
<v Speaker 3>It's just to have a shitload of cats on your website,</v>

207
00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:13.551
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

208
00:05:13.551 --> 00:05:16.940
<v Speaker 3>So if it's like wells Fargo Bank just put cats all over the place cause I think</v>

209
00:05:16.941 --> 00:05:19.640
<v Speaker 3>that's how crazy this shit is.</v>

210
00:05:19.641 --> 00:05:21.170
<v Speaker 3>Like do this anonymous and stuff is,</v>

211
00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.340
<v Speaker 3>it seems like they're only attacking people and unless you're,</v>

212
00:05:24.341 --> 00:05:25.520
<v Speaker 3>you don't get the Internet,</v>

213
00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:25.970
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

214
00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:26.751
<v Speaker 3>it's almost like,</v>

215
00:05:26.751 --> 00:05:26.991
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

219
00:05:32.351 --> 00:05:33.184
<v Speaker 3>But if you're,</v>

220
00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.630
<v Speaker 3>it's almost like it's like a gang,</v>

221
00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:37.190
<v Speaker 3>like an internet gang,</v>

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:09.020
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot if you like,</v>

296
00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.120
<v Speaker 1>if archeologists came here from the future,</v>

297
00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:11.511
<v Speaker 1>they'd be like,</v>

298
00:07:11.511 --> 00:07:11.961
<v Speaker 1>they might say,</v>

299
00:07:11.961 --> 00:07:16.961
<v Speaker 1>well they were this weird cat worshiping group of fucking ran environmentally</v>

300
00:07:17.031 --> 00:07:18.020
<v Speaker 1>conscious freaks.</v>

301
00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:18.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

302
00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:19.493
<v Speaker 1>Cats are running shit.</v>

303
00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:23.040
<v Speaker 1>And then they would find out about the toxo plasma shit and they would make some</v>

304
00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:26.600
<v Speaker 1>half ass hypothesis that the reason why we were so fascinated with cats as we</v>

305
00:07:26.601 --> 00:07:27.890
<v Speaker 1>all had toxo.</v>

306
00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:28.520
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

307
00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:28.851
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

308
00:07:28.851 --> 00:07:30.110
<v Speaker 1>And that's what made us all go crazy.</v>

309
00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:31.220
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that we uh,</v>

310
00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:31.760
<v Speaker 1>wrong,</v>

311
00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:32.230
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

312
00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:32.660
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

313
00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:33.620
<v Speaker 1>inaccurately,</v>

314
00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:34.460
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

315
00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:38.120
<v Speaker 1>get an idea of like past civilizations like,</v>

316
00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:39.113
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

317
00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:40.191
<v Speaker 1>you have to be right?</v>

318
00:07:40.191 --> 00:07:40.970
<v Speaker 1>Like where you're like,</v>

319
00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:42.110
<v Speaker 1>here's what they used to do.</v>

320
00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:42.980
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

321
00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:44.250
<v Speaker 4>in my mind,</v>

322
00:07:44.251 --> 00:07:44.640
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

323
00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:45.570
<v Speaker 4>thousand years ago,</v>

324
00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:50.750
<v Speaker 4>what fucks my mind is shit like sue mayor because there's only a fucking handful</v>

325
00:07:53.461 --> 00:07:54.930
<v Speaker 4>of people who can read that shit.</v>

326
00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:56.280
<v Speaker 4>That's cuneiform.</v>

327
00:07:56.281 --> 00:07:57.240
<v Speaker 4>I think it's called.</v>

328
00:07:57.390 --> 00:07:59.940
<v Speaker 4>And it's these weird lines and man,</v>

329
00:07:59.941 --> 00:08:02.310
<v Speaker 4>it takes forever to translate that shit.</v>

330
00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:04.350
<v Speaker 4>And there's a lot of discrepancies.</v>

331
00:08:04.351 --> 00:08:04.501
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

332
00:08:04.501 --> 00:08:07.320
<v Speaker 4>that's why that whole Zechariah Cichon movement,</v>

333
00:08:07.321 --> 00:08:08.340
<v Speaker 4>if you're not aware of that,</v>

334
00:08:08.341 --> 00:08:08.930
<v Speaker 4>this is,</v>

335
00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:09.171
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

336
00:08:09.171 --> 00:08:10.410
<v Speaker 4>the Zechariah snitching Shit,</v>

337
00:08:10.411 --> 00:08:10.880
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

338
00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:11.713
<v Speaker 4>That's that.</v>

339
00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:15.540
<v Speaker 4>He believes that in his study of the Sumerian texts,</v>

340
00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:18.810
<v Speaker 4>this guy was like a legit scholar on ancient languages.</v>

341
00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:20.640
<v Speaker 4>And he believed that his,</v>

342
00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:22.800
<v Speaker 4>through his study of the ancient Sumerian texts,</v>

343
00:08:22.801 --> 00:08:26.790
<v Speaker 4>he believed that it was a detailed account of how the human beings were created</v>

344
00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:30.030
<v Speaker 4>by an advanced intellect called the Annunaki.</v>

345
00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:33.000
<v Speaker 4>And that they mixed their DNA with us.</v>

346
00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:34.021
<v Speaker 4>And he says,</v>

347
00:08:34.021 --> 00:08:36.120
<v Speaker 4>this is all in this ancient text.</v>

348
00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:37.560
<v Speaker 4>And it's very disputed.</v>

349
00:08:37.590 --> 00:08:39.120
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of people that don't agree with them,</v>

350
00:08:39.121 --> 00:08:41.250
<v Speaker 4>a lot of like mainstream,</v>

351
00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:41.940
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

352
00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:43.500
<v Speaker 4>scholars from that era.</v>

353
00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:44.520
<v Speaker 4>They don't agree with them.</v>

354
00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:47.600
<v Speaker 4>But this guy stuck to his fucking guns and,</v>

355
00:08:47.601 --> 00:08:48.030
<v Speaker 4>and he,</v>

356
00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:52.860
<v Speaker 4>he believed that the entire human race was created by these,</v>

357
00:08:52.890 --> 00:08:53.221
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

358
00:08:53.221 --> 00:08:57.150
<v Speaker 4>these things called the Annunaki and this is all written down.</v>

359
00:08:57.450 --> 00:09:02.250
<v Speaker 4>What really fucks my mind is whether or not that's what they wrote down or what,</v>

360
00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:04.140
<v Speaker 4>who knows what crazy person wrote?</v>

361
00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:05.250
<v Speaker 4>Whatever you're reading,</v>

362
00:09:05.510 --> 00:09:05.810
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

363
00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:08.670
<v Speaker 4>what you're reading doesn't necessarily represent the whole world.</v>

364
00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:11.610
<v Speaker 4>What if you stumbled onto a pile of ancient Stephen King books?</v>

365
00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:12.061
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

366
00:09:12.061 --> 00:09:12.331
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

367
00:09:12.331 --> 00:09:15.960
<v Speaker 4>who the fuck knows who the fuck knows what exactly you're reading when,</v>

368
00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:16.500
<v Speaker 4>but it's,</v>

369
00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:20.220
<v Speaker 4>it fucks my mind that you can go that far back with people.</v>

370
00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:23.610
<v Speaker 4>It's like you can really trace progress,</v>

371
00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:26.490
<v Speaker 4>but things get lost somewhere along the way.</v>

372
00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:28.380
<v Speaker 4>And there's a few places where it's like,</v>

373
00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:30.150
<v Speaker 4>they'll just stumble on some shit and go,</v>

374
00:09:30.151 --> 00:09:30.451
<v Speaker 4>whoa,</v>

375
00:09:30.451 --> 00:09:30.661
<v Speaker 4>whoa,</v>

376
00:09:30.661 --> 00:09:30.931
<v Speaker 4>Whoa,</v>

377
00:09:30.931 --> 00:09:31.410
<v Speaker 4>whoa.</v>

378
00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:32.400
<v Speaker 4>Where'd this come from?</v>

379
00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:33.210
<v Speaker 4>Troy?</v>

380
00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:34.770
<v Speaker 4>You mean Troy is real?</v>

381
00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:36.120
<v Speaker 4>This is a real city.</v>

382
00:09:36.121 --> 00:09:36.811
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck?</v>

383
00:09:36.811 --> 00:09:38.310
<v Speaker 4>Now recently Atlantis,</v>

384
00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:40.500
<v Speaker 4>they found Atlantis in Spain.</v>

385
00:09:40.501 --> 00:09:40.630
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>

386
00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:41.760
<v Speaker 4>they're almost positive.</v>

387
00:09:41.761 --> 00:09:43.620
<v Speaker 4>It has the concentric rings.</v>

388
00:09:43.621 --> 00:09:44.790
<v Speaker 4>It looks just like it.</v>

389
00:09:44.791 --> 00:09:45.960
<v Speaker 4>It's in the right area.</v>

390
00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:46.480
<v Speaker 4>And they,</v>

391
00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:47.280
<v Speaker 4>there's all the illy.</v>

392
00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:47.611
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

393
00:09:47.611 --> 00:09:48.060
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

394
00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:48.893
<v Speaker 4>there's also,</v>

395
00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:49.860
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

396
00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:50.220
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

397
00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:55.220
<v Speaker 4>there's also some interesting evidence that there was a models of Atlantis that</v>

398
00:09:55.861 --> 00:09:56.850
<v Speaker 4>resembled this,</v>

399
00:09:56.910 --> 00:09:57.481
<v Speaker 4>this place,</v>

400
00:09:57.481 --> 00:10:02.130
<v Speaker 4>and they had been passed down like in the images so closely matched and had all</v>

401
00:10:02.131 --> 00:10:05.940
<v Speaker 4>these symbols in it represented like symbols of Atlantis.</v>

402
00:10:05.941 --> 00:10:07.740
<v Speaker 4>And it's just way too close.</v>

403
00:10:07.741 --> 00:10:10.170
<v Speaker 4>Like a lot of scholars are getting on board with this.</v>

404
00:10:10.171 --> 00:10:11.040
<v Speaker 4>They think they found it.</v>

405
00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:13.290
<v Speaker 4>So that's like so much shit is there.</v>

406
00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:16.020
<v Speaker 4>They're always finding ancient shit.</v>

407
00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:21.050
<v Speaker 4>It's like the civilization has gone so fucking far,</v>

408
00:10:21.091 --> 00:10:24.030
<v Speaker 4>but we can't really follow it in a straight line.</v>

409
00:10:24.031 --> 00:10:24.510
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

410
00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:26.670
<v Speaker 4>but especially after like before a certain time.</v>

411
00:10:26.671 --> 00:10:26.970
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

412
00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:29.550
<v Speaker 4>When you can't like 2000 BC.</v>

413
00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:30.450
<v Speaker 4>Oh Man,</v>

414
00:10:30.451 --> 00:10:30.990
<v Speaker 4>son.</v>

415
00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:32.370
<v Speaker 4>How long ago was that?</v>

416
00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:33.221
<v Speaker 4>And you notice,</v>

417
00:10:33.221 --> 00:10:33.780
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

418
00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:35.670
<v Speaker 4>when those things get like really old ones,</v>

419
00:10:35.671 --> 00:10:36.210
<v Speaker 4>they get like,</v>

420
00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:36.541
<v Speaker 4>they're like,</v>

421
00:10:36.541 --> 00:10:37.580
<v Speaker 4>this is a civilization.</v>

422
00:10:37.581 --> 00:10:40.590
<v Speaker 4>It's 40,000 years old and they,</v>

423
00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:41.070
<v Speaker 4>they'll,</v>

424
00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:41.520
<v Speaker 4>they'll,</v>

425
00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:41.761
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

426
00:10:41.761 --> 00:10:43.230
<v Speaker 4>they'll read something on the wall.</v>

427
00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:44.130
<v Speaker 4>They never,</v>

428
00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:44.670
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

429
00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:47.580
<v Speaker 4>I take into account the possibility that it's art.</v>

430
00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:48.803
<v Speaker 4>It's always like,</v>

431
00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:49.261
<v Speaker 4>they're like,</v>

432
00:10:49.261 --> 00:10:50.280
<v Speaker 4>this is the document,</v>

433
00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:55.310
<v Speaker 4>this is like documentation showing that they loved whales and that they would</v>

434
00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:59.820
<v Speaker 4>fuck here and talked to the son here and then eat the whale.</v>

435
00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:01.650
<v Speaker 4>Now this is what they did in their day.</v>

436
00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:02.311
<v Speaker 4>And you go,</v>

437
00:11:02.311 --> 00:11:05.400
<v Speaker 4>but what if it was just somebody painting or drawing?</v>

438
00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:06.630
<v Speaker 4>Like they never,</v>

439
00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:10.830
<v Speaker 4>that's never really a pull when human beings first figured out how to</v>

440
00:11:10.831 --> 00:11:14.640
<v Speaker 4>communicate for sure right away they started lying right away.</v>

441
00:11:14.770 --> 00:11:15.030
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

442
00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:15.421
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

443
00:11:15.421 --> 00:11:17.820
<v Speaker 4>as soon as they realize they can lie and get away with things.</v>

444
00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:19.590
<v Speaker 4>And then you don't get in trouble for stuff.</v>

445
00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:19.861
<v Speaker 4>It was,</v>

446
00:11:19.861 --> 00:11:21.390
<v Speaker 4>people just started lying for sure.</v>

447
00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:22.171
<v Speaker 4>It's just,</v>

448
00:11:22.171 --> 00:11:24.420
<v Speaker 4>it has to be old as fuck.</v>

449
00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:28.350
<v Speaker 4>It seems like just an inherent like escape door in,</v>

450
00:11:28.351 --> 00:11:29.250
<v Speaker 4>in consciousness,</v>

451
00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:34.020
<v Speaker 4>the ability to communicate but then give deceptive communication and fuck with</v>

452
00:11:34.021 --> 00:11:34.740
<v Speaker 4>other people.</v>

453
00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:35.830
<v Speaker 4>So from,</v>

454
00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:40.140
<v Speaker 4>from right away people were probably untrustworthy and especially in their</v>

455
00:11:40.141 --> 00:11:41.700
<v Speaker 4>depictions of the past,</v>

456
00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:44.070
<v Speaker 4>especially when they're talking about like things that happened.</v>

457
00:11:44.071 --> 00:11:44.281
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

458
00:11:44.281 --> 00:11:45.114
<v Speaker 4>Jesus Christ,</v>

459
00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:48.890
<v Speaker 4>everybody knows that the winners write the history books and you know,</v>

460
00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:51.420
<v Speaker 4>back then the history books were written on animal skins.</v>

461
00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:52.230
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

462
00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:53.190
<v Speaker 4>who the fuck,</v>

463
00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:54.130
<v Speaker 4>what really</v>

464
00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:54.963
<v Speaker 5>happened?</v>

465
00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:55.391
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

466
00:11:55.391 --> 00:11:55.721
<v Speaker 5>it's like,</v>

467
00:11:55.721 --> 00:11:57.610
<v Speaker 5>it's very shady at best and you don't,</v>

468
00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:00.910
<v Speaker 5>you never portray yourself really in a negative lab or shameful.</v>

469
00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:01.120
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

470
00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:01.571
<v Speaker 5>no one's,</v>

471
00:12:01.571 --> 00:12:02.410
<v Speaker 5>no one's a bad guy.</v>

472
00:12:03.210 --> 00:12:04.060
<v Speaker 5>If it's you,</v>

473
00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:04.631
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's,</v>

474
00:12:04.631 --> 00:12:05.920
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's of course there's,</v>

475
00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:06.221
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

476
00:12:06.221 --> 00:12:09.040
<v Speaker 5>different cultures and have different depictions of the steam store and you can</v>

477
00:12:09.041 --> 00:12:11.680
<v Speaker 5>kind of extrapolate from all those who's probably got it right.</v>

478
00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:13.450
<v Speaker 5>But it's a lot of gray area,</v>

479
00:12:13.451 --> 00:12:14.110
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

480
00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:14.950
<v Speaker 5>She was talking about,</v>

481
00:12:14.951 --> 00:12:15.131
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

482
00:12:15.131 --> 00:12:18.400
<v Speaker 5>thousands and thousands of years ago and then they constantly have to move the</v>

483
00:12:18.401 --> 00:12:19.234
<v Speaker 5>date.</v>

484
00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:23.470
<v Speaker 5>They found that place in Turkey recently over the last decade or so,</v>

485
00:12:23.471 --> 00:12:28.471
<v Speaker 5>I believe it's called go Beckley and it predates anything by like 5,000 years.</v>

486
00:12:29.561 --> 00:12:31.390
<v Speaker 5>It's like 12 13,000 years old.</v>

487
00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:32.020
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

488
00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:32.920
<v Speaker 5>no like fuck.</v>

489
00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:35.290
<v Speaker 5>Like we didn't even think people were making shit by,</v>

490
00:12:35.291 --> 00:12:35.680
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

491
00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:38.470
<v Speaker 5>they thought that back then people were just strictly hunter gatherers,</v>

492
00:12:38.830 --> 00:12:41.950
<v Speaker 5>so there's all sorts of light and they don't know that anything about that</v>

493
00:12:41.951 --> 00:12:42.310
<v Speaker 5>culture.</v>

494
00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:42.551
<v Speaker 5>They're like,</v>

495
00:12:42.551 --> 00:12:43.211
<v Speaker 5>what is this?</v>

496
00:12:43.211 --> 00:12:43.870
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

497
00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:47.500
<v Speaker 5>why do they have lizards on there on these rocks that they've carved out these</v>

498
00:12:47.501 --> 00:12:50.740
<v Speaker 5>giant columns with lizards on me and this one's got a sheep on it.</v>

499
00:12:50.741 --> 00:12:51.670
<v Speaker 5>What the fuck were they doing?</v>

500
00:12:52.530 --> 00:12:53.980
<v Speaker 5>Just all the stuff for the,</v>

501
00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:55.060
<v Speaker 5>what is this?</v>

502
00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:56.510
<v Speaker 5>The lines of Nascar I've ever seen,</v>

503
00:12:57.470 --> 00:12:57.941
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

504
00:12:57.941 --> 00:13:02.941
<v Speaker 5>dude may trip and there are so enormous,</v>

505
00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:03.791
<v Speaker 5>the whole thing.</v>

506
00:13:03.791 --> 00:13:04.031
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

507
00:13:04.031 --> 00:13:06.130
<v Speaker 5>I know that this is obviously what everyone says about it,</v>

508
00:13:06.131 --> 00:13:09.070
<v Speaker 5>but it really blows your mind when you think about it.</v>

509
00:13:09.310 --> 00:13:13.450
<v Speaker 5>The only way you could see what you're doing is if you're in the air.</v>

510
00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:18.640
<v Speaker 5>There's no other way to see how well you did this and these things are so old</v>

511
00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:20.130
<v Speaker 5>that like how is,</v>

512
00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:21.310
<v Speaker 5>how could you check it out?</v>

513
00:13:21.311 --> 00:13:22.130
<v Speaker 5>I mean the,</v>

514
00:13:22.130 --> 00:13:22.963
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

515
00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:25.210
<v Speaker 5>the lines are as wide as roads.</v>

516
00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:25.721
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

517
00:13:25.721 --> 00:13:26.560
<v Speaker 5>the roads.</v>

518
00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:27.040
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

519
00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:28.640
<v Speaker 5>Wide earns.</v>

520
00:13:28.690 --> 00:13:29.300
<v Speaker 5>Perfect.</v>

521
00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:29.740
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

522
00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:30.760
<v Speaker 5>Perfect lines.</v>

523
00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:33.490
<v Speaker 5>And the only way like you see crop,</v>

524
00:13:33.491 --> 00:13:34.480
<v Speaker 5>like they do it on farms,</v>

525
00:13:34.481 --> 00:13:34.721
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

526
00:13:34.721 --> 00:13:35.860
<v Speaker 5>Like they'll do like fun things,</v>

527
00:13:35.861 --> 00:13:37.690
<v Speaker 5>but the only way they're seeing what they're doing,</v>

528
00:13:37.691 --> 00:13:42.691
<v Speaker 5>if somebody is in a plane and radioing like now here drive six yards.</v>

529
00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:47.110
<v Speaker 5>Well the guys who make the crop circles don't have to do that.</v>

530
00:13:47.530 --> 00:13:48.910
<v Speaker 5>The guys who make the crop circles,</v>

531
00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:52.750
<v Speaker 5>what they figured out how to do is they just mark some numbers down.</v>

532
00:13:52.751 --> 00:13:53.730
<v Speaker 5>They figured out like distance.</v>

533
00:13:53.731 --> 00:13:54.071
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>

534
00:13:54.071 --> 00:13:54.880
<v Speaker 5>this is God.</v>

535
00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:58.090
<v Speaker 5>They call themselves a circle makers and they've shown that you can make</v>

536
00:13:58.150 --> 00:13:58.983
<v Speaker 5>certain,</v>

537
00:13:59.140 --> 00:13:59.411
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

538
00:13:59.411 --> 00:14:01.960
<v Speaker 5>certain pretty intricate grab circles.</v>

539
00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:06.730
<v Speaker 5>But what's amazing about this is we know that there's air flight.</v>

540
00:14:06.731 --> 00:14:11.200
<v Speaker 5>Now we know that people are going to see these crop circles mean if people made</v>

541
00:14:11.201 --> 00:14:13.150
<v Speaker 5>these things for fun or for High Jinks,</v>

542
00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:14.740
<v Speaker 5>if that's why they're making these crop circles,</v>

543
00:14:14.741 --> 00:14:15.760
<v Speaker 5>these beautiful designs,</v>

544
00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:16.631
<v Speaker 5>just to make people go,</v>

545
00:14:16.631 --> 00:14:16.771
<v Speaker 5>Whoa,</v>

546
00:14:16.771 --> 00:14:17.350
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck?</v>

547
00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:19.150
<v Speaker 5>We know that people are going to see him from a plane.</v>

548
00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:22.630
<v Speaker 5>So the idea that these can only be seen from the sky,</v>

549
00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:24.790
<v Speaker 5>it's like who are you making them for?</v>

550
00:14:24.850 --> 00:14:25.180
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

551
00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:29.380
<v Speaker 5>And the fact that there thousands and thousands of years old,</v>

552
00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:31.300
<v Speaker 5>it's the point where they don't really know exactly.</v>

553
00:14:31.301 --> 00:14:31.661
<v Speaker 5>Is that,</v>

554
00:14:31.661 --> 00:14:32.680
<v Speaker 5>do we not even know?</v>

555
00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:33.460
<v Speaker 5>They don't really know.</v>

556
00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:33.701
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

557
00:14:33.701 --> 00:14:34.451
<v Speaker 5>they don't know why.</v>

558
00:14:34.451 --> 00:14:35.111
<v Speaker 5>They don't know who.</v>

559
00:14:35.111 --> 00:14:36.370
<v Speaker 5>They don't know what it symbolizes.</v>

560
00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:39.160
<v Speaker 5>They don't know if the fucking mountain was flattened out.</v>

561
00:14:39.161 --> 00:14:39.994
<v Speaker 5>By the way,</v>

562
00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.120
<v Speaker 5>do you know there's an area where the Nazca lines is that it looks like it was</v>

563
00:14:43.121 --> 00:14:44.050
<v Speaker 5>fucking excavate.</v>

564
00:14:44.070 --> 00:14:44.500
<v Speaker 5>Excavate,</v>

565
00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:45.460
<v Speaker 5>excavated.</v>

566
00:14:45.490 --> 00:14:46.240
<v Speaker 5>Excuse me.</v>

567
00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:47.560
<v Speaker 5>It looks like it was excavated.</v>

568
00:14:47.561 --> 00:14:49.060
<v Speaker 5>It looks like it was flattened out.</v>

569
00:14:49.210 --> 00:14:50.710
<v Speaker 5>It looks like it was sculpted.</v>

570
00:14:50.711 --> 00:14:51.290
<v Speaker 5>It looks,</v>

571
00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:52.280
<v Speaker 5>it was worked</v>

572
00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:53.570
<v Speaker 1>on by machines.</v>

573
00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:55.130
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it was,</v>

574
00:14:55.550 --> 00:15:00.550
<v Speaker 1>but I wouldn't be fucking completely surprised that there wasn't some very</v>

575
00:15:01.401 --> 00:15:05.870
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated level of humanity at one point in time that died off and dropped</v>

576
00:15:05.871 --> 00:15:06.500
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>

577
00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:06.741
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

578
00:15:06.741 --> 00:15:08.690
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if they were ever as far as we were,</v>

579
00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:10.280
<v Speaker 1>but who knows,</v>

580
00:15:10.281 --> 00:15:10.730
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

581
00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:12.050
<v Speaker 1>when you see shit like that,</v>

582
00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:15.770
<v Speaker 1>there might have been some people flying fucking planes three or 4,000 years</v>

583
00:15:15.771 --> 00:15:15.981
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>

584
00:15:15.981 --> 00:15:16.970
<v Speaker 1>That might've been real.</v>

585
00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:17.840
<v Speaker 1>That could be,</v>

586
00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:18.673
<v Speaker 1>it might be.</v>

587
00:15:19.010 --> 00:15:19.581
<v Speaker 1>It might be.</v>

588
00:15:19.581 --> 00:15:19.771
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

589
00:15:19.771 --> 00:15:20.720
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking why.</v>

590
00:15:20.721 --> 00:15:20.990
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

591
00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:22.460
<v Speaker 1>why else would they draw those things,</v>

592
00:15:22.461 --> 00:15:22.821
<v Speaker 1>man?</v>

593
00:15:22.821 --> 00:15:23.810
<v Speaker 1>Why would they do that?</v>

594
00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:24.740
<v Speaker 1>They're incredible.</v>

595
00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:25.640
<v Speaker 1>Giant,</v>

596
00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:26.580
<v Speaker 1>massive and that,</v>

597
00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:26.781
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

598
00:15:26.781 --> 00:15:26.970
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

599
00:15:26.970 --> 00:15:28.430
<v Speaker 1>what's the purpose from this guy?</v>

600
00:15:28.431 --> 00:15:29.800
<v Speaker 1>You're supposed to look at it from the sky.</v>

601
00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:30.200
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

602
00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:33.410
<v Speaker 1>you know you're doing it just for the satisfaction of knowing that someone can</v>

603
00:15:33.411 --> 00:15:34.880
<v Speaker 1>look at it from this guy really,</v>

604
00:15:34.881 --> 00:15:37.790
<v Speaker 1>and this is going to be like a common practice in a place where it looks like</v>

605
00:15:37.791 --> 00:15:39.800
<v Speaker 1>there's runways and it's also,</v>

606
00:15:39.801 --> 00:15:41.180
<v Speaker 1>it's not only you have to see from this guy,</v>

607
00:15:41.210 --> 00:15:43.010
<v Speaker 1>it's out of the way in the sky.</v>

608
00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:45.410
<v Speaker 1>Like that shit is way out of the way.</v>

609
00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:46.281
<v Speaker 1>Maybe back then?</v>

610
00:15:46.281 --> 00:15:46.491
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

611
00:15:46.491 --> 00:15:48.380
<v Speaker 1>you didn't really understand life.</v>

612
00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:49.310
<v Speaker 1>So you're like,</v>

613
00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:52.550
<v Speaker 1>I know there's something up there that it storms on us.</v>

614
00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:53.150
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

615
00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:54.020
<v Speaker 1>we've heard thunder.</v>

616
00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:56.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to make a sign to a piece to the god,</v>

617
00:15:57.050 --> 00:15:57.351
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

618
00:15:57.351 --> 00:15:59.030
<v Speaker 1>so you might be not like a plane,</v>

619
00:15:59.031 --> 00:15:59.740
<v Speaker 1>but it's more like a,</v>

620
00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:02.570
<v Speaker 1>like a ritual for stability.</v>

621
00:16:02.690 --> 00:16:03.470
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

622
00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:03.801
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

623
00:16:03.801 --> 00:16:04.640
<v Speaker 1>That's possible.</v>

624
00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:06.160
<v Speaker 1>Like the,</v>

625
00:16:06.190 --> 00:16:08.540
<v Speaker 1>you have to consider more as the straight lines.</v>

626
00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:09.890
<v Speaker 1>They're looking like runways.</v>

627
00:16:10.130 --> 00:16:11.360
<v Speaker 1>They're all over the place up there.</v>

628
00:16:11.510 --> 00:16:12.110
<v Speaker 1>Huge.</v>

629
00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:14.300
<v Speaker 1>It looks like God Damn Logan Airport.</v>

630
00:16:14.510 --> 00:16:15.200
<v Speaker 1>That's what it looks like.</v>

631
00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:16.033
<v Speaker 1>It looks like an airport.</v>

632
00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:17.240
<v Speaker 1>Like there's all these runways.</v>

633
00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:21.370
<v Speaker 1>What's those big statues that ha like we're big rectangles that had their mouths</v>

634
00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:22.213
<v Speaker 1>open.</v>

635
00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:22.641
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

636
00:16:22.641 --> 00:16:23.750
<v Speaker 1>and they had like a,</v>

637
00:16:23.751 --> 00:16:26.630
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm talking about it and they used it in a gratis video game</v>

638
00:16:28.170 --> 00:16:29.003
<v Speaker 1>island.</v>

639
00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:30.430
<v Speaker 1>East islands.</v>

640
00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:30.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

641
00:16:30.750 --> 00:16:31.171
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

642
00:16:31.171 --> 00:16:31.610
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

643
00:16:31.610 --> 00:16:32.510
<v Speaker 1>Well that's a trip to,</v>

644
00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:33.171
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

645
00:16:33.171 --> 00:16:34.130
<v Speaker 1>that's a mean.</v>

646
00:16:34.190 --> 00:16:34.881
<v Speaker 1>Tasha is awesome.</v>

647
00:16:34.881 --> 00:16:35.600
<v Speaker 1>They really,</v>

648
00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:35.920
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

649
00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:39.800
<v Speaker 1>they struggled to figure out how they move those stones thousands and thousands</v>

650
00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:39.801
<v Speaker 1>of years ago.</v>

651
00:16:39.801 --> 00:16:40.551
<v Speaker 1>How they cut them so.</v>

652
00:16:40.551 --> 00:16:41.120
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

653
00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:42.560
<v Speaker 1>Machu Picchu is like that too.</v>

654
00:16:42.630 --> 00:16:42.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

655
00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:44.780
<v Speaker 1>Like those stones</v>

656
00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:45.810
<v Speaker 6>or no shit.</v>

657
00:16:46.290 --> 00:16:51.290
<v Speaker 6>Like the size of like the wall behind you and they lay in to another stone like</v>

658
00:16:51.751 --> 00:16:52.584
<v Speaker 6>this.</v>

659
00:16:52.590 --> 00:16:52.921
<v Speaker 6>They're like,</v>

660
00:16:52.921 --> 00:16:57.570
<v Speaker 6>you can't slide a piece of paper between them and you go,</v>

661
00:16:57.630 --> 00:16:59.280
<v Speaker 6>you look at these like boulders.</v>

662
00:16:59.281 --> 00:17:00.114
<v Speaker 6>Basically.</v>

663
00:17:00.210 --> 00:17:00.960
<v Speaker 6>They're smooth.</v>

664
00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:01.261
<v Speaker 6>They're like,</v>

665
00:17:01.261 --> 00:17:02.094
<v Speaker 6>they're shaped.</v>

666
00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:03.301
<v Speaker 6>They're massive.</v>

667
00:17:03.301 --> 00:17:07.260
<v Speaker 6>So you go like this would take hundreds of people and then how would you get it</v>

668
00:17:07.261 --> 00:17:10.740
<v Speaker 6>to fit into the next rock where it looks like they're made for each other?</v>

669
00:17:10.750 --> 00:17:11.400
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

670
00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:13.150
<v Speaker 6>It's unbelievable.</v>

671
00:17:13.151 --> 00:17:14.130
<v Speaker 6>It's pretty deep shit.</v>

672
00:17:14.340 --> 00:17:14.651
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

673
00:17:14.651 --> 00:17:15.600
<v Speaker 6>And you see how a la,</v>

674
00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:16.111
<v Speaker 6>I've been there.</v>

675
00:17:16.111 --> 00:17:17.940
<v Speaker 6>I've been there three times to that place.</v>

676
00:17:17.941 --> 00:17:18.774
<v Speaker 6>Too much a patriot.</v>

677
00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:19.260
<v Speaker 6>Really?</v>

678
00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:20.093
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

679
00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:21.200
<v Speaker 1>Is it cold trip?</v>

680
00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:21.711
<v Speaker 1>Like is it,</v>

681
00:17:21.711 --> 00:17:23.480
<v Speaker 1>would you recommend going as it like a vacation?</v>

682
00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:25.580
<v Speaker 1>Literally blow your mind every time.</v>

683
00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:26.600
<v Speaker 1>Every time.</v>

684
00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:27.231
<v Speaker 1>What does it like,</v>

685
00:17:27.231 --> 00:17:28.310
<v Speaker 1>what does it feel like when you're up there?</v>

686
00:17:28.311 --> 00:17:28.790
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it?</v>

687
00:17:28.790 --> 00:17:29.151
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

688
00:17:29.151 --> 00:17:31.060
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't like 10,000 feet above sea level.</v>

689
00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:31.641
<v Speaker 1>Something crazy.</v>

690
00:17:31.641 --> 00:17:32.690
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's that high up.</v>

691
00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:34.070
<v Speaker 1>It's that mean it's in the Andes.</v>

692
00:17:34.071 --> 00:17:34.620
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

693
00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:35.780
<v Speaker 1>you fly to,</v>

694
00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:41.460
<v Speaker 1>to Cusco in the south of Peru and then you take a train from Cusco to,</v>

695
00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:43.671
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

696
00:17:43.671 --> 00:17:46.280
<v Speaker 1>if I was a single girl and you're telling me all this,</v>

697
00:17:46.281 --> 00:17:47.210
<v Speaker 1>I'd be so attracted to,</v>

698
00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:49.670
<v Speaker 1>I feel like he's a man of the world</v>

699
00:17:50.110 --> 00:17:51.390
<v Speaker 5>and has been done match you,</v>

700
00:17:51.391 --> 00:17:51.700
<v Speaker 5>Pete,</v>

701
00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:52.021
<v Speaker 5>chewy.</v>

702
00:17:52.021 --> 00:17:52.801
<v Speaker 5>So amazing.</v>

703
00:17:52.801 --> 00:17:55.870
<v Speaker 5>I think I can get them to go vegan and he recommended Amarillo.</v>

704
00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:56.753
<v Speaker 5>That'd be like</v>

705
00:17:57.010 --> 00:17:57.761
<v Speaker 6>the Fart Porn,</v>

706
00:17:57.761 --> 00:17:59.950
<v Speaker 6>the 7,900 feet above sea level.</v>

707
00:17:59.951 --> 00:18:01.010
<v Speaker 6>That's where up man.</v>

708
00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:05.290
<v Speaker 6>And they have no idea how old that shit is either.</v>

709
00:18:05.291 --> 00:18:06.940
<v Speaker 6>Right now they have estimations for that.</v>

710
00:18:06.941 --> 00:18:09.910
<v Speaker 6>I mean it was definitely discovered by a,</v>

711
00:18:09.911 --> 00:18:10.390
<v Speaker 6>they,</v>

712
00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:10.960
<v Speaker 6>they,</v>

713
00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:14.050
<v Speaker 6>I think they said that they were there in the fifties and sixties they think it</v>

714
00:18:14.051 --> 00:18:14.884
<v Speaker 6>was been one,</v>

715
00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:16.630
<v Speaker 6>I think it was 1560s you know,</v>

716
00:18:16.631 --> 00:18:18.710
<v Speaker 6>that's one of those disputed ones with 'em,</v>

717
00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:20.020
<v Speaker 6>that Graham Hancock Guy,</v>

718
00:18:20.050 --> 00:18:23.380
<v Speaker 6>and I know a lot of people are this or pseudo science and he's the guy,</v>

719
00:18:23.410 --> 00:18:25.600
<v Speaker 6>the guy that predates all these.</v>

720
00:18:25.601 --> 00:18:27.190
<v Speaker 6>I'm like structures.</v>

721
00:18:27.191 --> 00:18:30.100
<v Speaker 6>Like he's got a thing on the Great Sphinx with this other guy,</v>

722
00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:35.110
<v Speaker 6>a doctor Robert Schoch out of a University of Massachusetts or Boston University</v>

723
00:18:35.681 --> 00:18:36.514
<v Speaker 6>rather,</v>

724
00:18:36.790 --> 00:18:39.610
<v Speaker 6>and they think that the Sphinx is like thousands and thousands of years older</v>

725
00:18:39.611 --> 00:18:40.660
<v Speaker 6>than everybody thinks it is.</v>

726
00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:43.180
<v Speaker 6>Then conventionally Egyptologists claiming as well,</v>

727
00:18:43.181 --> 00:18:43.351
<v Speaker 6>he's,</v>

878
00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:09.430
<v Speaker 1>I will talk about how good it is on Twitter.</v>

879
00:22:09.550 --> 00:22:12.460
<v Speaker 1>Please keep coming with the crazy monkey movies.</v>

880
00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:13.190
<v Speaker 1>Crazy monkey.</v>

881
00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:15.070
<v Speaker 1>Oh the shit dude.</v>

882
00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:16.090
<v Speaker 1>This one.</v>

883
00:22:16.090 --> 00:22:21.090
<v Speaker 1>So it looks like the researchers like are you fucking with a eight and they</v>

884
00:22:21.641 --> 00:22:22.600
<v Speaker 1>break out and,</v>

885
00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:22.811
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

886
00:22:22.811 --> 00:22:25.990
<v Speaker 1>this is sort of what's supposed to be the prequel to planet of the apes.</v>

887
00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:27.640
<v Speaker 1>This is what caused the problems.</v>

888
00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:28.730
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

889
00:22:28.730 --> 00:22:31.420
<v Speaker 1>this is the idea of planet of the apes is a guy goes to the future,</v>

890
00:22:31.421 --> 00:22:31.780
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

891
00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:34.940
<v Speaker 1>And lands in the future and that essentially run by monkeys.</v>

892
00:22:34.970 --> 00:22:35.910
<v Speaker 1>You think about the CGI.</v>

893
00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:37.293
<v Speaker 1>Incredible.</v>

894
00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:41.260
<v Speaker 1>Now it does have that little fake look and I'm sure it's still got a little bit</v>

895
00:22:41.261 --> 00:22:42.910
<v Speaker 1>of that I am legend Shit going on.</v>

896
00:22:42.911 --> 00:22:44.020
<v Speaker 1>When you look in their faces,</v>

897
00:22:44.450 --> 00:22:45.370
<v Speaker 1>they don't quite have it,</v>

898
00:22:45.371 --> 00:22:45.551
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

899
00:22:45.551 --> 00:22:49.360
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting that they can't do living things quite right.</v>

900
00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:50.583
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

901
00:22:50.590 --> 00:22:52.630
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if there's going to be any heartwarming moments.</v>

902
00:22:52.631 --> 00:22:52.711
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

903
00:22:52.711 --> 00:22:54.520
<v Speaker 1>it seems like there's gonna be some heartwarming moments.</v>

904
00:22:54.730 --> 00:22:55.331
<v Speaker 1>Let me tell you something.</v>

905
00:22:55.331 --> 00:22:57.130
<v Speaker 1>If you saw a chimp that look that you liked this champ,</v>

906
00:22:57.131 --> 00:23:00.340
<v Speaker 1>you would start screaming the fact that they were all cool with that.</v>

907
00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:00.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

908
00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:01.433
<v Speaker 1>This is weird.</v>

909
00:23:01.930 --> 00:23:03.100
<v Speaker 1>If you saw that chimp,</v>

910
00:23:03.190 --> 00:23:04.900
<v Speaker 1>that ship would be a huge internet hit.</v>

911
00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:05.321
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

912
00:23:05.321 --> 00:23:07.360
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know Dexter Morgan was in this.</v>

913
00:23:08.170 --> 00:23:09.003
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:14.120
<v Speaker 1>This is like bad ass preview Jonathan Lipo and uh,</v>

916
00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:15.491
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

917
00:23:15.491 --> 00:23:16.324
<v Speaker 1>Just a moment.</v>

918
00:23:16.330 --> 00:23:17.260
<v Speaker 1>This is the full one.</v>

919
00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:17.560
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

920
00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:19.150
<v Speaker 1>this would shows you where they fucked up.</v>

921
00:23:19.151 --> 00:23:19.901
<v Speaker 1>They raised a chimp.</v>

922
00:23:19.901 --> 00:23:22.600
<v Speaker 1>That was their little buddy and they locked him up in a jail.</v>

923
00:23:22.630 --> 00:23:23.560
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

924
00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:26.980
<v Speaker 1>So it's got a good fucking comeback sets to it.</v>

925
00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:28.600
<v Speaker 1>You root for the chimps.</v>

926
00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:31.880
<v Speaker 1>You realize what conscious human beings are and you root for the chimps.</v>

927
00:23:31.881 --> 00:23:33.310
<v Speaker 1>Is that the log line for the movie?</v>

928
00:23:33.311 --> 00:23:33.570
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

929
00:23:33.570 --> 00:23:34.920
<v Speaker 1>That's the way I'm promoting.</v>

930
00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:37.820
<v Speaker 1>I'm promoting it on sort of a separate underground labels,</v>

931
00:23:37.821 --> 00:23:38.950
<v Speaker 1>sort of division of the movie.</v>

932
00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:39.970
<v Speaker 1>This is what we do now.</v>

933
00:23:40.150 --> 00:23:42.700
<v Speaker 1>We sort of do shit behind the scenes.</v>

<v Speaker 5>that's our promotion.</v>

939
00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:51.080
<v Speaker 5>This is one of those amazing trailers I've ever seen.</v>

940
00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:52.750
<v Speaker 5>He is intense.</v>

941
00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:56.090
<v Speaker 5>The last thing you ever want is a chimp coming at you,</v>

942

944
00:23:58.220 --> 00:24:01.760
<v Speaker 5>You're almost better off with a lion because the lion is just going to kill you</v>

945
00:24:01.761 --> 00:24:02.594
<v Speaker 5>quick.</v>

946
00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:06.760
<v Speaker 5>Chimps are going to do some shit to you before you die by your fingers or</v>

947
00:24:06.770 --> 00:24:07.100
<v Speaker 5>they're going to,</v>

948
00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:08.120
<v Speaker 5>they're not trying to kill you.</v>

949
00:24:08.121 --> 00:24:09.020
<v Speaker 5>They're trying to hurt you.</v>

950
00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:13.130
<v Speaker 5>They understand what makes you a person and they don't have morals.</v>

951
00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:14.870
<v Speaker 5>They understand what's important to you.</v>

952
00:24:14.871 --> 00:24:17.090
<v Speaker 5>They understand your genitals mean a lot to you.</v>

953
00:24:17.091 --> 00:24:18.410
<v Speaker 5>So the bike those off.</v>

954
00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:18.780
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

955
00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:20.950
<v Speaker 5>They understand that your fingers are important for you to,</v>

956
00:24:21.010 --> 00:24:22.100
<v Speaker 5>to use to make things.</v>

957
00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:23.870
<v Speaker 5>So they bite all those off next.</v>

958
00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:24.081
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

959
00:24:24.081 --> 00:24:27.110
<v Speaker 5>And they do all this without you being able to do a goddamn thing to stop it.</v>

960
00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:27.830
<v Speaker 5>Nothing.</v>

961
00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:30.950
<v Speaker 5>Because they're so fucking strong and once they bite one finger off,</v>

962
00:24:30.951 --> 00:24:31.131
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>

963

965
00:24:32.721 --> 00:24:34.190
<v Speaker 5>You're not gonna be able to handle it for him.</v>

966
00:24:34.191 --> 00:24:35.150
<v Speaker 5>It's another day in the park.</v>

967
00:24:35.330 --> 00:24:37.070
<v Speaker 5>He's been biting fingers off since he was two.</v>

968
00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:37.400
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

969

970
00:24:38.871 --> 00:24:40.070
<v Speaker 5>Who Bites a couple of fingers off.</v>

<v Speaker 5>That's just what they do and strong as fuck.</v>

972
00:24:42.570 --> 00:24:45.020
<v Speaker 5>Can't even wrap your head around how strong a champion's dude.</v>

973
00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:47.320
<v Speaker 5>We had a two year old chip on a set of news radio,</v>

974
00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:49.610
<v Speaker 5>a two year old little baby ass chimp.</v>

975
00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:54.530
<v Speaker 5>This thing was on my back and it's swatted me in the back a couple of times and</v>

976
00:24:54.531 --> 00:24:55.311
<v Speaker 5>I swear to God,</v>

977
00:24:55.311 --> 00:24:56.210
<v Speaker 5>I got nervous.</v>

978
00:24:56.211 --> 00:24:58.400
<v Speaker 5>It made me nervous cause I was thinking like,</v>

979
00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:00.560
<v Speaker 5>what if a cat wanted to kill me?</v>

980
00:25:00.710 --> 00:25:00.981
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

981
00:25:00.981 --> 00:25:02.030
<v Speaker 5>if a cat wanted to kill me,</v>

982
00:25:02.031 --> 00:25:02.810
<v Speaker 5>that's terrifying.</v>

983
00:25:02.810 --> 00:25:03.350
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

984
00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:04.340
<v Speaker 5>Cats or you know,</v>

985
00:25:04.370 --> 00:25:07.370
<v Speaker 5>I mean even though they're little like that fucking crazy thing coming at you</v>

986
00:25:07.371 --> 00:25:08.204
<v Speaker 5>trying to kill it.</v>

987
00:25:08.210 --> 00:25:08.390
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

988
00:25:08.390 --> 00:25:09.470
<v Speaker 5>that would be terrifying.</v>

989
00:25:09.471 --> 00:25:09.771
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

990
00:25:09.771 --> 00:25:10.251
<v Speaker 5>and you're way,</v>

991
00:25:10.251 --> 00:25:11.210
<v Speaker 5>way bigger than a cat.</v>

992
00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:11.931
<v Speaker 5>And I was thinking,</v>

993
00:25:11.931 --> 00:25:14.450
<v Speaker 5>how much bigger is this chimp than a cat?</v>

994
00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:16.460
<v Speaker 5>And at this champ decided to just fuck me up.</v>

995
00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:19.310
<v Speaker 5>I'm not really sure I could defend myself.</v>

996
00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:21.080
<v Speaker 5>He's a two year old chimp and I'm not.</v>

997
00:25:21.081 --> 00:25:22.880
<v Speaker 5>I'm not really sure that I would get off.</v>

998
00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:24.590
<v Speaker 5>And then I thought about it and I think,</v>

999
00:25:24.591 --> 00:25:25.424
<v Speaker 5>my God,</v>

1000
00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:28.640
<v Speaker 5>what must it be like when they're like 150 pounds?</v>

1001
00:25:28.670 --> 00:25:30.590
<v Speaker 5>It must be unbelievable.</v>

1002
00:25:30.830 --> 00:25:33.980
<v Speaker 5>The amount of force they can generate with their bodies must get you some</v>

1003
00:25:34.130 --> 00:25:34.940
<v Speaker 5>shocking.</v>

1004
00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:37.220
<v Speaker 5>They can rip car doors off their hinges.</v>

1005
00:25:37.250 --> 00:25:37.640
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1006
00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:39.680
<v Speaker 5>do you can lock a car door and they can just open it.</v>

1007
00:25:39.681 --> 00:25:40.514
<v Speaker 5>They can open that.</v>

1008
00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:41.150
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1009
00:25:41.150 --> 00:25:42.260
<v Speaker 5>Fuck that.</v>

1010
00:25:42.290 --> 00:25:43.460
<v Speaker 5>Fuck that right today.</v>

1011
00:25:43.550 --> 00:25:44.091
<v Speaker 5>That lady,</v>

1012
00:25:44.091 --> 00:25:45.920
<v Speaker 5>they tour with their hands.</v>

1013
00:25:45.921 --> 00:25:49.160
<v Speaker 5>They tore her jaw out of her face and lower jaw came out,</v>

1014
00:25:49.161 --> 00:25:49.430
<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>

1015
00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:50.480
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>

1016
00:25:51.290 --> 00:25:52.310

1017
00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:52.971
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>

1018
00:25:52.971 --> 00:25:53.300
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1019
00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:54.380
<v Speaker 5>there's scary,</v>

1020
00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:55.880
<v Speaker 5>scary fucking creatures.</v>

1021
00:25:56.090 --> 00:25:59.810
<v Speaker 5>It's so funny that we always want to like look at them like they're real cute</v>

1022
00:25:59.811 --> 00:25:59.991
<v Speaker 5>too.</v>

1023
00:25:59.991 --> 00:26:04.050
<v Speaker 5>Like Bj Mckee and this is my best friend bear band.</v>

1024
00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:06.860
<v Speaker 5>It was the best smoking the band and have a monkey.</v>

1025
00:26:06.890 --> 00:26:07.550
<v Speaker 5>Wait,</v>

1026
00:26:07.550 --> 00:26:08.480
<v Speaker 5>what was the one of the monkey?</v>

1027
00:26:08.510 --> 00:26:08.841
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1028
00:26:08.841 --> 00:26:09.674
<v Speaker 5>Curtis would,</v>

1029
00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:12.620
<v Speaker 5>Clint Eastwood had a Orangutang every which way,</v>

1030
00:26:12.621 --> 00:26:13.250
<v Speaker 5>but loose.</v>

1031
00:26:13.250 --> 00:26:14.083
<v Speaker 5>That's the one that's,</v>

1032
00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:16.470
<v Speaker 5>the partner has no idea what he's talking about.</v>

1033
00:26:16.471 --> 00:26:17.171
<v Speaker 5>Being in the band.</v>

1034
00:26:17.171 --> 00:26:19.010
<v Speaker 5>Some of the best moments in my childhood,</v>

1035
00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:21.270
<v Speaker 5>it was that guy with the monkey who which one?</v>

1036
00:26:22.550 --> 00:26:22.851
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

1037
00:26:22.851 --> 00:26:23.540
<v Speaker 5>Burt Reynolds.</v>

1038
00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:23.880
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

1039
00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:24.713
<v Speaker 5>fine,</v>

1040
00:26:24.890 --> 00:26:26.390
<v Speaker 5>but they all came out at the same time.</v>

1041
00:26:26.390 --> 00:26:29.630
<v Speaker 5>There was like that car chase movie then there was kind of monkeys.</v>

1042
00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:30.300
<v Speaker 5>No I don't.</v>

1043
00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:32.480
<v Speaker 5>I think every movie in that time period had a monkey.</v>

1044
00:26:32.481 --> 00:26:37.430
<v Speaker 5>It seemed like a strong move by Clint Eastwood to go from Spaghetti Westerns to</v>

1045
00:26:37.431 --> 00:26:38.300
<v Speaker 5>the bad ass,</v>

1046
00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:40.530
<v Speaker 5>bare knuckle fist fighter with a monkey has event.</v>

1047
00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:42.140
<v Speaker 5>Well the orangutan,</v>

1048
00:26:42.530 --> 00:26:45.480
<v Speaker 5>those movies were great man every which way but loose.</v>

1049
00:26:45.481 --> 00:26:47.310
<v Speaker 5>They were great fucking movies for sure.</v>

1050
00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:50.730
<v Speaker 5>And what's even more fascinating about those movies is that's when he was still</v>

1051
00:26:50.731 --> 00:26:51.690
<v Speaker 5>married to that woman,</v>

1052
00:26:51.870 --> 00:26:52.780
<v Speaker 5>Sandra Locke,</v>

1053
00:26:52.781 --> 00:26:56.250
<v Speaker 5>the woman who had gone to sue him and he had to get her some sort of a deal to</v>

1054
00:26:56.251 --> 00:26:57.000
<v Speaker 5>get out of switch.</v>

1055
00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:57.833
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1056
00:26:58.110 --> 00:27:01.440
<v Speaker 5>Had to get her some sort of a deal with a production company as a part of their</v>

1057
00:27:01.441 --> 00:27:01.981
<v Speaker 5>divorce.</v>

1058
00:27:01.981 --> 00:27:02.731
<v Speaker 5>And he did.</v>

1059
00:27:02.731 --> 00:27:03.270
<v Speaker 5>And then,</v>

1060
00:27:03.270 --> 00:27:03.510
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1061
00:27:03.510 --> 00:27:06.860
<v Speaker 5>she accused him of sabotaging her projects and their projects bringing,</v>

1062
00:27:06.910 --> 00:27:07.080
<v Speaker 5>going.</v>

1063
00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:07.201
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

1064
00:27:07.201 --> 00:27:11.670
<v Speaker 5>it was obvious that this guy fucked up like poor Clint Eastwood married this</v>

1065
00:27:11.671 --> 00:27:12.504
<v Speaker 5>crazy broad,</v>

1066
00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:13.081
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1067
00:27:13.081 --> 00:27:14.580
<v Speaker 5>and was with her for years and you know,</v>

1068
00:27:14.581 --> 00:27:16.320
<v Speaker 5>she's an actress and when they broke up,</v>

1069
00:27:16.321 --> 00:27:16.591
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

1070
00:27:16.591 --> 00:27:18.580
<v Speaker 5>she just fucking went after him and,</v>

1071
00:27:18.581 --> 00:27:19.160
<v Speaker 5>and you,</v>

1072
00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:19.591
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1073
00:27:19.591 --> 00:27:24.591
<v Speaker 5>you got to see the nastiness that that can happen and those sort of like really</v>

1074
00:27:25.111 --> 00:27:28.950
<v Speaker 5>public divorces between two fucking movie stars at the time.</v>

1075
00:27:28.951 --> 00:27:29.101
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1076
00:27:29.101 --> 00:27:30.690
<v Speaker 5>she never really worked again after that.</v>

1077
00:27:30.990 --> 00:27:31.823
<v Speaker 5>Not much.</v>

1078
00:27:31.830 --> 00:27:32.011
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1079
00:27:32.011 --> 00:27:34.200
<v Speaker 5>I've done not have that level,</v>

1080

<v Speaker 5>but she wasn't a lot of clinics.</v>

1081
00:27:35.401 --> 00:27:39.120
<v Speaker 5>So it's movies and the amount of money that exchanges hands and a divorce like</v>

1082
00:27:39.121 --> 00:27:39.390
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

1162
00:29:28.291 --> 00:29:29.070
<v Speaker 5>70 years old?</v>

1163
00:29:29.070 --> 00:29:29.400
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1164
00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:30.020
<v Speaker 5>I think so.</v>

1165
00:29:30.020 --> 00:29:33.030
<v Speaker 5>At least 25 year old pussy is so powerful.</v>

1166
00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:36.060
<v Speaker 5>It will get you to abandon your morals,</v>

1167
00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:36.570
<v Speaker 5>your idea.</v>

1168
00:29:36.570 --> 00:29:39.300
<v Speaker 5>You like the bull yet you will rationalize the shit out of his.</v>

1169
00:29:39.301 --> 00:29:39.511
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1170
00:29:39.511 --> 00:29:40.830
<v Speaker 5>I've known her since she was a baby,</v>

1171
00:29:40.930 --> 00:29:42.760
<v Speaker 5>but we're not like related by blood.</v>

1172
00:29:42.910 --> 00:29:43.270
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1173
00:29:43.270 --> 00:29:43.841
<v Speaker 5>That's crazy.</v>

1174
00:29:43.841 --> 00:29:44.840
<v Speaker 5>But they never get met.</v>

1175
00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:46.670
<v Speaker 5>Plus he does so good.</v>

1176
00:29:46.690 --> 00:29:47.470
<v Speaker 5>Cause he's an old,</v>

1177
00:29:47.470 --> 00:29:48.370
<v Speaker 5>old man.</v>

1178
00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:49.150
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1179
00:29:49.150 --> 00:29:52.450
<v Speaker 5>she's young and tight and she's trying to rock him because she likes the</v>

1180
00:29:52.451 --> 00:29:53.080
<v Speaker 5>spotlight.</v>

1181
00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:54.100
<v Speaker 5>She likes the fact that she's,</v>

1182
00:29:54.290 --> 00:29:54.610
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1183
00:29:54.610 --> 00:29:58.300
<v Speaker 5>throwing some pussy at Morgan Freeman or is it the best payback ever to your ex</v>

1184
00:29:58.301 --> 00:30:00.220
<v Speaker 5>wife or he's the one who goes after it.</v>

1185
00:30:00.221 --> 00:30:01.230
<v Speaker 5>He couldn't be a creep to,</v>

1186
00:30:01.490 --> 00:30:02.500
<v Speaker 5>you've got to look at it that way.</v>

1187
00:30:02.530 --> 00:30:02.800
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>

1188
00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:04.010
<v Speaker 5>It could have been Hawkin her,</v>

1189
00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:04.450
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1190
00:30:04.450 --> 00:30:08.620
<v Speaker 5>his whole life and waiting for her to turn 18 and start putting it to her.</v>

1191
00:30:08.650 --> 00:30:12.320
<v Speaker 5>How about the dude who just married the 16 year old haven't lost.</v>

<v Speaker 5>That's the crazy part.</v>

1197
00:30:20.110 --> 00:30:21.250
<v Speaker 5>Your parents have to,</v>

1198
00:30:21.251 --> 00:30:23.650
<v Speaker 5>if you're 16 in Vegas and you want to get married,</v>

1199
00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:25.790
<v Speaker 5>you have to get like permission.</v>

1200
00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:26.673
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1201
00:30:26.690 --> 00:30:29.920
<v Speaker 5>And I think it was probably set up for teen pregnancies and shit like that.</v>

1202
00:30:29.921 --> 00:30:31.090
<v Speaker 5>Somebody's trying to do the right thing.</v>

00:30:38.260 --> 00:30:39.350
<v Speaker 5>We'll get guys like that.</v>

00:30:41.021 --> 00:30:41.440
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

1214
00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:41.801
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1215
00:30:41.801 --> 00:30:44.200
<v Speaker 5>You can't go around Mary and 16 year olds.</v>

1216
00:30:44.201 --> 00:30:45.640
<v Speaker 5>People kind of want to hang out with you,</v>

1217
00:30:45.641 --> 00:30:46.320
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

1218
00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:46.570
<v Speaker 5>This,</v>

1219
00:30:46.570 --> 00:30:49.090
<v Speaker 5>this ain't the 1950s and you're not Jerry Lee Lewis.</v>

1220
00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:49.850
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

1221
00:30:49.850 --> 00:30:50.590
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>

1222
00:30:50.590 --> 00:30:51.850
<v Speaker 5>You can't marry that girl.</v>

1223
00:30:52.270 --> 00:30:53.140
<v Speaker 5>That's crazy.</v>

1224
00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:55.180
<v Speaker 5>That's got to keep him from jobs too.</v>

1225
00:30:55.270 --> 00:30:59.260
<v Speaker 5>Like there's a few directors or producers out there who would consider that dude</v>

1226
00:30:59.261 --> 00:31:02.260
<v Speaker 5>for a job and then hear that and go in that man.</v>

1227
00:31:02.290 --> 00:31:02.611
<v Speaker 5>What,</v>

1228
00:31:02.611 --> 00:31:02.701
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1229
00:31:02.701 --> 00:31:03.670
<v Speaker 5>what's the other guy's name?</v>

1230
00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:04.570
<v Speaker 5>Let's get you on the phone.</v>

1231
00:31:04.750 --> 00:31:05.141
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1232
00:31:05.141 --> 00:31:05.531
<v Speaker 5>Listen,</v>

1233
00:31:05.531 --> 00:31:06.730
<v Speaker 5>he's not that good.</v>

1234
00:31:07.090 --> 00:31:07.660
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1235
00:31:07.660 --> 00:31:11.980
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to say that that's not worth the show unless it was some sort of a</v>

1236
00:31:11.981 --> 00:31:15.640
<v Speaker 5>reality show based on the two of them that that could work.</v>

1237
00:31:15.670 --> 00:31:16.270
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1238
00:31:16.270 --> 00:31:18.760
<v Speaker 5>That could work or reality show based on a 16 year old,</v>

1239
00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:21.490
<v Speaker 5>but it really be unfair to the 16 year old because you know,</v>

1240
00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:22.660
<v Speaker 5>when you were 16 years old,</v>

1241
00:31:22.661 --> 00:31:27.460
<v Speaker 5>would you really want some document out there of who you were and how you behave</v>

1242
00:31:27.461 --> 00:31:30.490
<v Speaker 5>when you were 16 and the whole world can look at it whenever they want,</v>

1243
00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:34.090
<v Speaker 5>especially when you fucked up and you married some 51 year old dude,</v>

1244
00:31:34.330 --> 00:31:34.691
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1245
00:31:34.691 --> 00:31:34.991
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1246
00:31:34.991 --> 00:31:36.940
<v Speaker 5>why should everybody be able to look into your shit?</v>

1247
00:31:37.090 --> 00:31:39.580
<v Speaker 5>You're not really old enough to understand what the fuck that means.</v>

1248
00:31:39.580 --> 00:31:43.240
<v Speaker 5>Yet you're not really old enough to understand the ramifications of the whole</v>

1249
00:31:43.241 --> 00:31:43.721
<v Speaker 5>world.</v>

1250
00:31:43.721 --> 00:31:45.220
<v Speaker 5>Being able to look in on that,</v>

1251
00:31:45.630 --> 00:31:45.880
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1252
00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:47.710
<v Speaker 5>so that you couldn't have a reality show with her.</v>

1253
00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:51.580
<v Speaker 5>I think about how little I think about how little you knew when you were 16 oh</v>

1254
00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:52.630
<v Speaker 5>my God,</v>

1255
00:31:53.020 --> 00:31:55.120
<v Speaker 5>I was such a fucking Douche bag.</v>

1256
00:31:55.150 --> 00:31:55.511
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1257
00:31:55.511 --> 00:31:55.930
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

1258
00:31:55.930 --> 00:31:56.250
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

1259
00:31:56.250 --> 00:31:58.670
<v Speaker 5>imagine if you had to meet yourself today and hang out with yourself.</v>

1260
00:31:58.730 --> 00:31:59.590
<v Speaker 5>It's a 16 year old.</v>

1261
00:31:59.591 --> 00:32:00.424
<v Speaker 5>I'd be like,</v>

1262
00:32:00.670 --> 00:32:01.121
<v Speaker 5>seriously?</v>

1263
00:32:01.121 --> 00:32:02.680
<v Speaker 5>Just to shut the fuck up.</v>

1264
00:32:02.890 --> 00:32:03.880
<v Speaker 5>Just shut the fuck up.</v>

1265
00:32:03.881 --> 00:32:04.714
<v Speaker 5>Dude.</v>

1266
00:32:04.810 --> 00:32:05.171
<v Speaker 5>I tell you,</v>

1267
00:32:05.171 --> 00:32:05.980
<v Speaker 5>I found it.</v>

1268
00:32:05.980 --> 00:32:06.531
<v Speaker 5>I found it.</v>

1269
00:32:06.531 --> 00:32:07.540
<v Speaker 5>I'll just give myself a hug.</v>

1270
00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:10.600
<v Speaker 5>I found a video of my son would probably need a slow kiss.</v>

1271
00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:12.280
<v Speaker 5>I found a video of myself.</v>

1272
00:32:12.350 --> 00:32:13.350
<v Speaker 5>I took a camera,</v>

1273
00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:13.480
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1274
00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:16.480
<v Speaker 5>camcorder to a party when I was 18.</v>

1275
00:32:16.510 --> 00:32:17.530
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>

1276
00:32:17.531 --> 00:32:17.950
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1277
00:32:17.950 --> 00:32:18.371
<v Speaker 5>And a,</v>

1278
00:32:18.371 --> 00:32:19.204
<v Speaker 5>it was like,</v>

1279
00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:23.290
<v Speaker 5>I'm a senior in high school and I walked through and I just talked to people and</v>

1280
00:32:23.291 --> 00:32:27.280
<v Speaker 5>I put the camera on myself and I'm just doing this for like 30 minutes at this</v>

1281
00:32:27.281 --> 00:32:28.060
<v Speaker 5>party.</v>

1282
00:32:28.060 --> 00:32:29.140
<v Speaker 5>I watched the video,</v>

1283
00:32:29.710 --> 00:32:33.100
<v Speaker 5>I took it out and then I broke the tape and I burned it.</v>

1284
00:32:33.130 --> 00:32:33.580
<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>

1285
00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:34.120
<v Speaker 5>Whoa.</v>

1286
00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:34.421
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1287
00:32:34.421 --> 00:32:35.880
<v Speaker 5>And it wasn't anything incriminating.</v>

1288
00:32:35.890 --> 00:32:36.251
<v Speaker 5>It was just,</v>

1289
00:32:36.251 --> 00:32:37.210
<v Speaker 5>I was so,</v>

1290
00:32:37.750 --> 00:32:40.490
<v Speaker 5>it was like a really rapid,</v>

1291
00:32:40.490 --> 00:32:45.340
<v Speaker 1>like instinctive response to how much I loathed myself as an 18.</v>

1292
00:32:45.410 --> 00:32:45.801
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1293
00:32:45.801 --> 00:32:47.000
<v Speaker 1>that's fucking embarrassing.</v>

1294
00:32:47.150 --> 00:32:48.410
<v Speaker 1>I don't want anybody to see that.</v>

1295
00:32:48.411 --> 00:32:51.620
<v Speaker 1>And I told her I was like not nostalgic or like,</v>

1296
00:32:51.621 --> 00:32:52.730
<v Speaker 1>that'd be cool to show it to my kid.</v>

1297
00:32:52.731 --> 00:32:53.031
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>

1298
00:32:53.031 --> 00:32:54.290
<v Speaker 1>I hope my kids never could find that.</v>

1299
00:32:55.430 --> 00:32:55.970
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1300
00:32:55.970 --> 00:32:57.110
<v Speaker 1>Because I was fucking like,</v>

1301
00:32:57.111 --> 00:32:57.381
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

1302
00:32:57.381 --> 00:32:58.071

1335
00:33:46.311 --> 00:33:49.670
<v Speaker 1>once you have children of your own and you start thinking about the process of</v>

1336
00:33:49.730 --> 00:33:52.670
<v Speaker 1>going from being a baby to actually being a human and all the shit you have to</v>

1337

<v Speaker 1>learn along the way,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Like I don't want any evidence that I was a retard.</v>

<v Speaker 5>You want to suck.</v>

1542
00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:02.220
<v Speaker 5>The best part though is at that time you don't know.</v>

1543
00:39:02.290 --> 00:39:03.123
<v Speaker 5>You think you're good.</v>

1544
00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:06.100
<v Speaker 5>There was a bunch of times where I was like open mic nights and I couldn't get</v>

1545
00:39:06.101 --> 00:39:06.191
<v Speaker 5>on.</v>

1546
00:39:06.191 --> 00:39:07.210
<v Speaker 5>I was like man I'm going to get up there.</v>

1547
00:39:07.211 --> 00:39:08.490
<v Speaker 5>I'll fucking show these people what's up.</v>

1548
00:39:08.491 --> 00:39:09.550
<v Speaker 5>And meanwhile I was terrible.</v>

1549
00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:13.510
<v Speaker 5>I shouldn't not have had any confidence whatsoever know that I can go up there</v>

1550
00:39:13.550 --> 00:39:14.590
<v Speaker 5>and make people laugh.</v>

1551
00:39:14.620 --> 00:39:15.453
<v Speaker 5>I was awful.</v>

1552
00:39:15.460 --> 00:39:16.840
<v Speaker 5>I shouldn't have been allowed to talk ever.</v>

1553
00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:21.010
<v Speaker 5>I should have been practicing with only people barely spoke English for the</v>

1554
00:39:21.011 --> 00:39:24.560
<v Speaker 5>years to work my way is the main stream.</v>

1555
00:39:25.020 --> 00:39:26.290
<v Speaker 5>But that's just how it is.</v>

1556
00:39:26.291 --> 00:39:26.860
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

1557
00:39:26.860 --> 00:39:27.431
<v Speaker 5>Absolutely.</v>

1558
00:39:27.431 --> 00:39:29.050
<v Speaker 5>I remember like you remember like when you have,</v>

1559
00:39:29.290 --> 00:39:34.290
<v Speaker 5>when you finally have like 10 or 15 minutes down that kills and then something</v>

1560
00:39:34.991 --> 00:39:37.840
<v Speaker 5>happens one night where like you just don't know how to react to a room.</v>

1561
00:39:37.900 --> 00:39:39.880
<v Speaker 5>Oh so it doesn't kill it actually bombs.</v>

1562
00:39:40.420 --> 00:39:41.380
<v Speaker 5>This is the shit.</v>

1563
00:39:41.381 --> 00:39:43.540
<v Speaker 5>Like this is the best material at all time.</v>

1564
00:39:44.170 --> 00:39:47.500
<v Speaker 5>Best thing I got my toolbox and you have nothing else to go to.</v>

1565
00:39:48.580 --> 00:39:52.630
<v Speaker 5>That is like a paralyzing feeling and then you realize cause you'd killed with</v>

1566
00:39:52.631 --> 00:39:56.860
<v Speaker 5>it so many times you get a feeling of being kind of invincible and then when it</v>

1567
00:39:56.861 --> 00:39:58.870
<v Speaker 5>doesn't kill your like maybe Oh shit.</v>

1568
00:39:58.871 --> 00:40:00.640
<v Speaker 5>Like maybe this isn't amazed.</v>

1569
00:40:00.670 --> 00:40:03.250
<v Speaker 5>Like that's where you wish you had a real job.</v>

1570
00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:03.881
<v Speaker 5>It's like God,</v>

1571
00:40:03.881 --> 00:40:07.690
<v Speaker 5>if I just had a job I'd be like reporting back to the stockholder as well.</v>

1572
00:40:08.050 --> 00:40:12.130
<v Speaker 5>We have a discrepancy between the projected income and the actual income.</v>

1573
00:40:12.131 --> 00:40:13.810
<v Speaker 5>We're going to give you some figures on this on Monday,</v>

1574
00:40:13.811 --> 00:40:15.340
<v Speaker 5>but it's nothing we can't fix.</v>

1575
00:40:15.670 --> 00:40:16.390
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1576
00:40:16.390 --> 00:40:18.080
<v Speaker 5>But when you're out there and saw all you,</v>

1582
00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:29.800
<v Speaker 5>They can't say that because what you're doing is you're the boss,</v>

1583
00:40:29.830 --> 00:40:30.230
<v Speaker 5>you're the boss,</v>

1585
00:40:30.761 --> 00:40:32.410
<v Speaker 5>The end of the line is you stupid.</v>

1586
00:40:32.650 --> 00:40:36.430
<v Speaker 5>And if you're doing it and you don't know how to dance like now if like</v>

1587
00:40:36.431 --> 00:40:37.690
<v Speaker 5>something like if it were to be like,</v>

1588
00:40:37.691 --> 00:40:38.111
<v Speaker 5>man this,</v>

1589
00:40:38.111 --> 00:40:38.920
<v Speaker 5>that was really,</v>

1590
00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:40.780
<v Speaker 5>that was what that job bombed or something happened.</v>

1591
00:40:41.290 --> 00:40:44.230
<v Speaker 5>You have the tools after a while to adjust to that.</v>

1592
00:40:44.590 --> 00:40:49.060
<v Speaker 5>The problem then is that like you just don't even know how to it like and you</v>

1593
00:40:49.061 --> 00:40:51.010
<v Speaker 5>panic and they found they panic for you.</v>

1594
00:40:51.070 --> 00:40:51.461
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

1595
00:40:51.461 --> 00:40:53.140
<v Speaker 5>They see the panic and then they're like,</v>

1596
00:40:53.170 --> 00:40:53.411
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

1597
00:40:53.411 --> 00:40:54.244
<v Speaker 5>we're all panicking.</v>

1598
00:40:54.810 --> 00:40:56.680
<v Speaker 5>Like then you're in a fucking elevator fire.</v>

1599
00:40:56.710 --> 00:40:57.640
<v Speaker 5>Like people are just like,</v>

1600
00:40:57.641 --> 00:40:59.140
<v Speaker 5>how the fuck do we get out of here?</v>

1601
00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:01.060
<v Speaker 5>I was a recently,</v>

1602
00:41:01.090 --> 00:41:05.980
<v Speaker 5>I saw a friend of mine and he fucked up a joke and then after you fucked up a</v>

1603
00:41:05.981 --> 00:41:06.281
<v Speaker 5>joke,</v>

1604
00:41:06.281 --> 00:41:10.660
<v Speaker 5>he started rushing the next joke because you could feel that he fucked up and</v>

1605
00:41:10.661 --> 00:41:13.930
<v Speaker 5>that joke bombed and then I felt like the spin,</v>

1606
00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:14.651
<v Speaker 5>I felt the spin,</v>

1607
00:41:14.651 --> 00:41:15.484
<v Speaker 5>the slide and my,</v>

1608
00:41:15.550 --> 00:41:17.830
<v Speaker 5>my toes started crunching up on my shoes.</v>

1609
00:41:17.831 --> 00:41:18.910
<v Speaker 5>I clenched my hands together.</v>

1610
00:41:19.090 --> 00:41:20.230
<v Speaker 5>He pulled himself out of it,</v>

1611
00:41:20.350 --> 00:41:21.520
<v Speaker 5>but I almost had to leave the room.</v>

1612
00:41:21.610 --> 00:41:21.970
<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>

1613
00:41:21.970 --> 00:41:22.360
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1614
00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:23.193
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1615
00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:26.400
<v Speaker 5>He got a couple of good laughs and then the ball started rolling again.</v>

1616
00:41:26.410 --> 00:41:26.770
<v Speaker 5>That was like,</v>

1617
00:41:26.770 --> 00:41:27.071
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

1618
00:41:27.071 --> 00:41:27.904
<v Speaker 5>we're back.</v>

1619
00:41:27.910 --> 00:41:31.630
<v Speaker 5>But it's the uncomfortable thing of watching someone's slide down the road to</v>

1620
00:41:31.631 --> 00:41:32.310
<v Speaker 5>bombed them.</v>

1621
00:41:32.310 --> 00:41:33.143
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1622
00:41:33.260 --> 00:41:34.070
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to be there for</v>

1623
00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:34.470
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1624
00:41:34.470 --> 00:41:34.700
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1625
00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:34.950
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1626
00:41:34.950 --> 00:41:35.900
<v Speaker 1>it's really painful.</v>

1627
00:41:35.930 --> 00:41:37.070
<v Speaker 1>I don't need to see that dude.</v>

1628
00:41:37.100 --> 00:41:37.371
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

1629

1630
00:41:37.821 --> 00:41:38.750
<v Speaker 1>That's why I ride a lot.</v>

1631
00:41:39.050 --> 00:41:39.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

00:42:21.140 --> 00:42:21.721

00:42:21.721 --> 00:42:23.660
<v Speaker 1>they're recording themselves doing Salvey,</v>

1664
00:42:23.661 --> 00:42:24.680
<v Speaker 1>which a lot of people do.</v>

1665
00:42:25.010 --> 00:42:25.251
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1666
00:42:25.251 --> 00:42:26.510
<v Speaker 1>What is the big deal about that?</v>

1667
00:42:26.540 --> 00:42:27.590
<v Speaker 1>How'd that all get going?</v>

1668
00:42:27.620 --> 00:42:28.421
<v Speaker 1>Because you,</v>

1669
00:42:28.421 --> 00:42:31.610
<v Speaker 1>you leave your body like it's only a couple minutes,</v>

1670
00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:32.171
<v Speaker 1>so you,</v>

1671
00:42:32.171 --> 00:42:33.890
<v Speaker 1>you're really interested to see what happens,</v>

1672
00:42:33.891 --> 00:42:34.131
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1673
00:42:34.131 --> 00:42:34.970
<v Speaker 1>cause you're out of it,</v>

1674
00:42:34.971 --> 00:42:38.450
<v Speaker 1>but you're awake type thing when everybody does it the same way you guys did it</v>

1675
00:42:38.451 --> 00:42:43.040
<v Speaker 1>with Ari and what I would imagine it's like the worst environment possible.</v>

1676
00:42:43.060 --> 00:42:43.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1677
00:42:43.430 --> 00:42:44.780
<v Speaker 1>When you're filming these fucking things.</v>

1678
00:42:44.781 --> 00:42:45.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1679
00:42:45.230 --> 00:42:50.110
<v Speaker 1>So the worst environment possible this do takes some rips off this bone.</v>

1680
00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:50.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1681
00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:50.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1682
00:42:50.930 --> 00:42:51.650
<v Speaker 1>Like he,</v>

1683
00:42:51.650 --> 00:42:56.480
<v Speaker 1>I mean I can't say what that does for people don't know what the Fuck Salvia is.</v>

1684
00:42:56.490 --> 00:42:58.070
<v Speaker 1>Feet squares out there.</v>

1685
00:42:58.310 --> 00:43:01.220
<v Speaker 1>Salvia is a super powerful psychedelic drug,</v>

1686
00:43:01.221 --> 00:43:04.010
<v Speaker 1>but is a very legal for some weird reason.</v>

1687
00:43:04.011 --> 00:43:04.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1688
00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:09.520
<v Speaker 1>It was one that was missed in the whole sweeping psychedelic drug acts of the</v>

1689
00:43:09.831 --> 00:43:11.330
<v Speaker 1>1970s whatever it was,</v>

1690
00:43:11.390 --> 00:43:14.330
<v Speaker 1>1970 when they made everything illegal,</v>

1691
00:43:14.450 --> 00:43:15.141
<v Speaker 1>somehow or another,</v>

1692
00:43:15.141 --> 00:43:16.010
<v Speaker 1>they miss Salvia.</v>

1693
00:43:16.430 --> 00:43:19.710
<v Speaker 1>So these people are taking something and other laugh and their balls off.</v>

1694
00:43:19.780 --> 00:43:20.613
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1695
00:43:20.870 --> 00:43:24.890
<v Speaker 1>it's a hundred times more powerful than marijuana and you can buy it in head</v>

1696
00:43:24.891 --> 00:43:25.820
<v Speaker 1>shops legally.</v>

1697
00:43:27.500 --> 00:43:29.360
<v Speaker 1>It's like this is normal shit.</v>

1698
00:43:29.361 --> 00:43:31.130
<v Speaker 1>Like people laughing right time.</v>

1699
00:43:31.610 --> 00:43:33.580
<v Speaker 1>Then the Ari Shaffir factory.</v>

1700
00:43:33.610 --> 00:43:36.560
<v Speaker 1>It just takes a turn almost.</v>

1701
00:43:36.561 --> 00:43:37.394
<v Speaker 1>See the moment.</v>

1702
00:43:37.970 --> 00:43:38.630
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>

1703
00:43:38.630 --> 00:43:39.463
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

00:43:40.340 --> 00:43:40.641

<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

1708
00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:49.520
<v Speaker 1>One thing to note is that the camera's off tilted.</v>

1709
00:43:50.330 --> 00:43:51.590
<v Speaker 1>Like why is it not centered?</v>

1710
00:43:51.620 --> 00:43:54.680
<v Speaker 1>This is one of the best advertisements ever for don't do drugs.</v>

1711
00:43:54.850 --> 00:43:55.683

1712
00:43:55.730 --> 00:43:57.410

1713
00:43:58.130 --> 00:43:59.390
<v Speaker 1>but it's really good acting.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1729
00:44:14.150 --> 00:44:16.100
<v Speaker 1>And then she kind of just comes to it.</v>

1730
00:44:16.150 --> 00:44:16.520
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1731
00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:17.510
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

1732

00:44:21.080 --> 00:44:21.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1737
00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:21.771
<v Speaker 1>Part two.</v>

1738
00:44:21.771 --> 00:44:23.120
<v Speaker 1>She's just totally,</v>

1739
00:44:23.150 --> 00:44:23.691
<v Speaker 1>what'd you just say?</v>

1740
00:44:23.691 --> 00:44:24.524
<v Speaker 1>Part two.</v>

1741
00:44:25.070 --> 00:44:25.820
<v Speaker 1>This is fake,</v>

1742
00:44:25.820 --> 00:44:27.650
<v Speaker 1>but somebody just fake.</v>

1743
00:44:27.730 --> 00:44:28.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1744
00:44:28.180 --> 00:44:28.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1745
00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:28.820
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

1746
00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:30.230
<v Speaker 1>that's don't do drug video.</v>

1747
00:44:30.231 --> 00:44:30.800
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1748
00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:31.710
<v Speaker 1>This looks fake to me.</v>

1749
00:44:31.890 --> 00:44:32.420
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1750
00:44:32.420 --> 00:44:32.730
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1751
00:44:32.730 --> 00:44:33.930
<v Speaker 5>I don't like the way he,</v>

1752
00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:36.330
<v Speaker 5>he randomly stumbled into the window.</v>

1753
00:44:36.630 --> 00:44:39.640
<v Speaker 3>I don't like is that the camera is not centered.</v>

1754
00:44:39.670 --> 00:44:39.991
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1755
00:44:39.991 --> 00:44:44.350
<v Speaker 3>it's actually so you can see both windows like the couches to the right of the</v>

1756
00:44:44.380 --> 00:44:46.300
<v Speaker 3>camera and has a camera man.</v>

1757
00:44:46.450 --> 00:44:47.620
<v Speaker 3>If you're sending up yourself record,</v>

1758
00:44:47.621 --> 00:44:49.030
<v Speaker 3>why won't you zoom in on the couch?</v>

1759
00:44:49.031 --> 00:44:50.350
<v Speaker 3>You're not going to sit at that far back.</v>

1760
00:44:50.351 --> 00:44:51.370
<v Speaker 3>And it showed that much window.</v>

1761
00:44:51.371 --> 00:44:53.500
<v Speaker 3>And why is it showing its off centered?</v>

1762
00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:55.450
<v Speaker 3>I always thought it was fake,</v>

1763
00:44:55.451 --> 00:44:57.670
<v Speaker 3>but I wanted to see what you guys thought as soon as fake.</v>

1764
00:44:57.700 --> 00:44:59.380
<v Speaker 3>The way he moves seems fake.</v>

1765
00:44:59.430 --> 00:44:59.960
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1766
00:44:59.960 --> 00:45:00.381
<v Speaker 5>The way he,</v>

1767
00:45:00.381 --> 00:45:02.900
<v Speaker 5>he jumped up the way had jumped up to me,</v>

1768
00:45:02.910 --> 00:45:04.550
<v Speaker 5>looked like he was putting on a show.</v>

1769
00:45:04.610 --> 00:45:04.910
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1770
00:45:04.910 --> 00:45:06.200
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's the impression that I got.</v>

1771
00:45:06.201 --> 00:45:07.034
<v Speaker 5>I might be wrong,</v>

1772
00:45:07.310 --> 00:45:09.440
<v Speaker 5>but my impression was that he was putting on a show,</v>

1773
00:45:10.330 --> 00:45:12.830
<v Speaker 5>a guy who was really scared of when,</v>

1774
00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:14.300
<v Speaker 5>when you're really fucked up,</v>

1775
00:45:14.450 --> 00:45:17.430
<v Speaker 5>can you shut that off part isn't stolen cause you hear talking in the</v>

1776
00:45:17.431 --> 00:45:18.264
<v Speaker 5>background.</v>

1777
00:45:18.550 --> 00:45:19.220
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1778
00:45:19.220 --> 00:45:21.980
<v Speaker 5>when you're really fucked up on something and you can't walk you,</v>

1779
00:45:21.981 --> 00:45:23.450
<v Speaker 5>you don't know how to control your body.</v>

1780
00:45:23.630 --> 00:45:26.030
<v Speaker 5>And that guy was like catching himself the right way.</v>

1781
00:45:26.300 --> 00:45:28.190
<v Speaker 5>He was like saving himself the right way every time.</v>

1782
00:45:28.191 --> 00:45:32.180
<v Speaker 5>To me it looked like he was way more together than he was pretending to be and</v>

1783
00:45:32.181 --> 00:45:33.560
<v Speaker 5>went right through that window.</v>

1784
00:45:33.561 --> 00:45:34.850
<v Speaker 5>He didn't pull out of it at all.</v>

1785
00:45:35.090 --> 00:45:39.500
<v Speaker 5>Like he knows well enough to keep his balance while he's stumbling around.</v>

1786
00:45:39.500 --> 00:45:40.970
<v Speaker 5>He knows to protect his bounds,</v>

1787
00:45:41.150 --> 00:45:42.980
<v Speaker 5>but it doesn't know to not go through a window.</v>

1788
00:45:43.070 --> 00:45:43.903
<v Speaker 5>I don't buy that.</v>

1789
00:45:43.980 --> 00:45:47.630
<v Speaker 5>And you don't buy also falls out of the top part of the window,</v>

1790
00:45:48.650 --> 00:45:51.680
<v Speaker 5>the divided and there's all this smashing and you know,</v>

1791
00:45:51.681 --> 00:45:53.900
<v Speaker 5>but it doesn't look like smashing window to me,</v>

1792
00:45:54.230 --> 00:45:54.591
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

1793
00:45:54.591 --> 00:45:54.861
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1794
00:45:54.861 --> 00:45:57.260
<v Speaker 5>he just kind of like leaning on and all of a sudden it's going through.</v>

1795
00:45:58.480 --> 00:45:59.090
<v Speaker 5>What is that?</v>

1796
00:45:59.090 --> 00:45:59.781
<v Speaker 5>That looks fake.</v>

1797
00:45:59.781 --> 00:46:00.614
<v Speaker 5>The window looks fake.</v>

1798
00:46:00.860 --> 00:46:02.960
<v Speaker 5>The fact that he would just go over it and write through it.</v>

1799
00:46:02.961 --> 00:46:04.010
<v Speaker 5>He wouldn't stop himself.</v>

1800
00:46:04.160 --> 00:46:04.993
<v Speaker 5>Come on son.</v>

1801
00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:05.830
<v Speaker 3>And if you noticed,</v>

1802
00:46:05.830 --> 00:46:06.050
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1803
00:46:06.050 --> 00:46:09.250
<v Speaker 3>when all that was happening there was off camera a,</v>

1804
00:46:09.290 --> 00:46:13.440
<v Speaker 3>he must have hit a light or a lamp and did the light bulb blow up flash.</v>

1805
00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:15.320
<v Speaker 3>So it was really dramatic because it was like,</v>

1806
00:46:15.350 --> 00:46:15.680
<v Speaker 3>Ooh,</v>

1807
00:46:15.680 --> 00:46:16.850
<v Speaker 3>a light bulb flash.</v>

1808
00:46:16.851 --> 00:46:18.080
<v Speaker 3>And that right there as a,</v>

1809
00:46:18.081 --> 00:46:20.000
<v Speaker 3>as a looking at to me thought,</v>

1810
00:46:20.030 --> 00:46:20.241
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1811
00:46:20.241 --> 00:46:23.470
<v Speaker 3>that's purposely put there to make it more dramatic and realistic looking.</v>

1812
00:46:23.471 --> 00:46:23.780
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1813
00:46:23.780 --> 00:46:24.201
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1814
00:46:24.201 --> 00:46:25.034
<v Speaker 5>maybe right.</v>

1815
00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:26.120
<v Speaker 5>Maybe it wasn't even real.</v>

1816
00:46:26.121 --> 00:46:27.470
<v Speaker 5>Maybe they added it to the film,</v>

1817
00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:29.330
<v Speaker 5>right effect really into it.</v>

1818
00:46:29.331 --> 00:46:30.740
<v Speaker 5>When I saw that you really,</v>

1819
00:46:30.770 --> 00:46:31.190
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1820
00:46:31.190 --> 00:46:32.260

1824
00:46:34.041 --> 00:46:37.160
<v Speaker 5>Was that I thought it was my first reaction was fake.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Might be right.</v>

1829
00:46:39.500 --> 00:46:39.980
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

1830
00:46:39.980 --> 00:46:40.790
<v Speaker 5>We might be wrong.</v>

1831
00:46:40.790 --> 00:46:42.050
<v Speaker 5>It might be a whole new story about it.</v>

1832
00:46:42.580 --> 00:46:43.010
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1843
00:46:59.691 --> 00:47:00.770
<v Speaker 5>They kind of held them down,</v>

1844
00:47:01.020 --> 00:47:02.390

<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

2125
00:54:08.910 --> 00:54:10.200
<v Speaker 5>we kept getting off track.</v>

2126
00:54:10.460 --> 00:54:11.850
<v Speaker 5>W you got there,</v>

2127
00:54:11.910 --> 00:54:13.110

<v Speaker 5>Who's Colima and you stay there.</v>

2129
00:54:15.700 --> 00:54:20.070
<v Speaker 5>Usually most people stay there at least like a day or two to get acclimated to,</v>

<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2133
00:54:22.380 --> 00:54:27.380
<v Speaker 5>And then you take a train from Cusco to what is essentially the bottom of the</v>

2134
00:54:28.051 --> 00:54:29.970
<v Speaker 5>mountain that Machu Picchu is on.</v>

2135
00:54:30.330 --> 00:54:31.980
<v Speaker 5>And then you take a bus up the hill.</v>

2136
00:54:32.240 --> 00:54:33.600
<v Speaker 5>He'd be very unsafe.</v>

2140
00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:39.270
<v Speaker 5>There's a road and then this mountain to the righthand side.</v>

2141
00:54:39.330 --> 00:54:40.020

2143
00:54:40.500 --> 00:54:43.710

2144
00:54:43.711 --> 00:54:46.500
<v Speaker 5>anything in on a bus just going up,</v>

2145
00:54:46.530 --> 00:54:46.771
<v Speaker 5>up,</v>

2146
00:54:46.771 --> 00:54:47.011

2149
00:54:49.680 --> 00:54:50.370
<v Speaker 5>That kind of thing.</v>

2150
00:54:50.370 --> 00:54:51.630
<v Speaker 5>That stuff where you can look,</v>

2151
00:54:51.631 --> 00:54:54.570
<v Speaker 5>you can look out of your bus window and just see down.</v>

2152
00:54:54.600 --> 00:54:54.781
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2153
00:54:54.781 --> 00:54:56.130
<v Speaker 5>Your bus driver falls asleep.</v>

2154
00:54:56.131 --> 00:54:56.880
<v Speaker 5>Freaks out.</v>

2155
00:54:56.880 --> 00:54:57.713
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2156
00:54:58.260 --> 00:54:58.830
<v Speaker 5>whatever.</v>

2157
00:54:58.830 --> 00:54:59.670
<v Speaker 5>Had a long night,</v>

2158
00:54:59.880 --> 00:55:01.320
<v Speaker 5>a dog runs across the road,</v>

2159
00:55:01.321 --> 00:55:02.430
<v Speaker 5>he has to hit the brakes.</v>

2160
00:55:02.490 --> 00:55:04.170
<v Speaker 5>Drinks just does anything.</v>

2161
00:55:04.171 --> 00:55:05.370
<v Speaker 5>Jesus Christ.</v>

2162
00:55:05.430 --> 00:55:05.790
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2163
00:55:05.790 --> 00:55:06.750
<v Speaker 5>It's not like,</v>

2164
00:55:06.870 --> 00:55:07.500
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

2165
00:55:07.500 --> 00:55:07.821
<v Speaker 5>how,</v>

2166
00:55:07.821 --> 00:55:09.300
<v Speaker 5>how wide is the road not wide.</v>

2167
00:55:10.010 --> 00:55:11.090
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

2168
00:55:11.910 --> 00:55:16.910
<v Speaker 5>I did the Pacific coast highway once the drive from California,</v>

2169
00:55:17.071 --> 00:55:18.110
<v Speaker 5>from southern California,</v>

2170
00:55:18.130 --> 00:55:19.920
<v Speaker 5>northern California along the coast.</v>

2171
00:55:19.921 --> 00:55:21.390
<v Speaker 5>It's fucking amazing.</v>

2172
00:55:21.660 --> 00:55:22.560
<v Speaker 5>Amazing.</v>

2173
00:55:22.860 --> 00:55:24.480
<v Speaker 5>While you're driving now you just like,</v>

2174
00:55:24.510 --> 00:55:25.201
<v Speaker 5>oh my God,</v>

2175
00:55:25.201 --> 00:55:26.250
<v Speaker 5>this is so incredible.</v>

2176
00:55:26.430 --> 00:55:31.430
<v Speaker 5>But you can't even look at it because you're glued that little skinny slice of</v>

2177
00:55:31.651 --> 00:55:34.590
<v Speaker 5>rock hanging over the Pacific Ocean,</v>

2178
00:55:34.591 --> 00:55:34.921
<v Speaker 5>by the way,</v>

2179
00:55:34.921 --> 00:55:37.530
<v Speaker 5>in a place where the ground moves all the time.</v>

2180
00:55:37.550 --> 00:55:38.070
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2181
00:55:38.070 --> 00:55:40.200
<v Speaker 5>And you're driving 35 miles an hour.</v>

2182
00:55:40.201 --> 00:55:41.190
<v Speaker 5>You can't drive any faster.</v>

2183
00:55:41.191 --> 00:55:42.510
<v Speaker 5>Cause he's a fucking person in front of you.</v>

2184
00:55:42.630 --> 00:55:43.141
<v Speaker 5>And by the way,</v>

2185
00:55:43.141 --> 00:55:43.441
<v Speaker 5>when you're,</v>

2186
00:55:43.441 --> 00:55:46.530
<v Speaker 5>you're in a cooperative agreement with all those other fuck sticks on that road.</v>

2187
00:55:46.530 --> 00:55:46.880
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2188
00:55:46.880 --> 00:55:47.041
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2189
00:55:47.041 --> 00:55:50.130
<v Speaker 5>you got to know that this guy come in this way isn't just freaking out and</v>

2190
00:55:50.250 --> 00:55:54.330
<v Speaker 5>stomping on his gas and turning into traffic because his girlfriend left him</v>

2191
00:55:54.390 --> 00:55:54.730
<v Speaker 5>right now.</v>

2192
00:55:54.730 --> 00:55:58.200
<v Speaker 5>You gotta you gotta hope that everyone you meet is keeping it together.</v>

2193
00:55:58.860 --> 00:56:00.400
<v Speaker 5>Fuck that and fuck man,</v>

2194
00:56:00.460 --> 00:56:04.470
<v Speaker 5>it's terrifying because you don't have to take that.</v>

2195
00:56:04.471 --> 00:56:04.640
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

2196
00:56:04.640 --> 00:56:07.620
<v Speaker 5>well here's a quicker route is actually to not take when I want to.</v>

2197
00:56:07.621 --> 00:56:10.740
<v Speaker 5>Taking that route on the ocean is just the scenic view.</v>

2198
00:56:10.741 --> 00:56:11.400
<v Speaker 5>So we,</v>

2199
00:56:11.400 --> 00:56:12.780
<v Speaker 5>I did it once with an ex girlfriend of mine.</v>

2200
00:56:12.781 --> 00:56:14.620
<v Speaker 5>I got a ticket going up and to going.</v>

2201
00:56:15.060 --> 00:56:17.580
<v Speaker 5>How long does it speed trap because they know you want to drive home.</v>

2202
00:56:17.610 --> 00:56:18.000
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2203
00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:18.481
<v Speaker 5>I mean again,</v>

2204
00:56:18.481 --> 00:56:18.690
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2205
00:56:18.690 --> 00:56:21.900
<v Speaker 5>he lives out there so it's all just people driving from San Francisco to La</v>

2206
00:56:21.901 --> 00:56:22.501
<v Speaker 5>along the coast.</v>

2207
00:56:22.501 --> 00:56:24.160
<v Speaker 5>So it's crazy speed traps.</v>

2208
00:56:24.220 --> 00:56:25.053
<v Speaker 6>How long does that take?</v>

2209
00:56:25.160 --> 00:56:25.841
<v Speaker 6>So long time.</v>

2210
00:56:25.841 --> 00:56:26.440
<v Speaker 6>I don't remember.</v>

2211
00:56:26.440 --> 00:56:27.820
<v Speaker 6>It's like somewhere around six hours.</v>

2212
00:56:27.821 --> 00:56:29.680
<v Speaker 6>I think it was somewhere around that.</v>

2213
00:56:29.710 --> 00:56:30.120
<v Speaker 6>And that's it.</v>

2214
00:56:30.120 --> 00:56:30.910
<v Speaker 6>If you're,</v>

2215
00:56:30.910 --> 00:56:31.300
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2216
00:56:31.300 --> 00:56:32.770
<v Speaker 6>following a reasonable pace.</v>

2217
00:56:32.920 --> 00:56:33.281
<v Speaker 6>We actually,</v>

2218
00:56:33.281 --> 00:56:34.390
<v Speaker 6>I think went to Monterey,</v>

2219
00:56:34.510 --> 00:56:36.370
<v Speaker 6>that's where we went and then went to San Francisco later.</v>

2220
00:56:36.371 --> 00:56:37.900
<v Speaker 6>But it's not worth the drive.</v>

2221
00:56:37.901 --> 00:56:39.370
<v Speaker 6>It's a fucking cunt of a drive.</v>

2222
00:56:39.460 --> 00:56:40.070
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2223
00:56:40.070 --> 00:56:40.903
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2224
00:56:41.220 --> 00:56:42.370
<v Speaker 6>That takes way longer.</v>

2225
00:56:42.470 --> 00:56:43.181
<v Speaker 6>But the coast,</v>

2226
00:56:43.181 --> 00:56:44.410
<v Speaker 6>but the Machu Picchu things.</v>

2227
00:56:44.411 --> 00:56:46.140
<v Speaker 6>So you're on this road here on this road,</v>

2228
00:56:46.141 --> 00:56:49.330
<v Speaker 6>there's no guard rail and just like that where it's a skinny road on the side of</v>

2229
00:56:49.331 --> 00:56:50.081
<v Speaker 6>a giant mountain.</v>

2230
00:56:50.081 --> 00:56:51.100
<v Speaker 6>You're in the driver's hands,</v>

2231
00:56:51.101 --> 00:56:53.650
<v Speaker 6>like how long from the time that you land in the plane,</v>

2232
00:56:53.830 --> 00:56:55.960
<v Speaker 6>how long before you actually get to the top and this bus?</v>

2233
00:56:55.980 --> 00:56:56.590
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

2234
00:56:56.590 --> 00:56:56.951
<v Speaker 6>you land,</v>

2235
00:56:56.951 --> 00:56:57.311
<v Speaker 6>like I said,</v>

2236
00:56:57.311 --> 00:56:58.031
<v Speaker 6>you land in Cusco.</v>

2237
00:56:58.031 --> 00:57:00.160
<v Speaker 6>Usually I stay there a day or two.</v>

2238
00:57:00.550 --> 00:57:02.050
<v Speaker 6>Then take a train.</v>

2239
00:57:02.170 --> 00:57:04.240
<v Speaker 6>It's a couple hour train ride I want to say.</v>

2240
00:57:04.270 --> 00:57:06.070
<v Speaker 6>Do you stay there on purpose to normalize?</v>

2241
00:57:06.140 --> 00:57:06.640
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2242
00:57:06.640 --> 00:57:07.240
<v Speaker 6>most people do.</v>

2243
00:57:07.240 --> 00:57:08.073
<v Speaker 6>Most people do.</v>

2244
00:57:08.320 --> 00:57:08.441
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2245
00:57:08.441 --> 00:57:12.070
<v Speaker 6>because also since you already flew in to Cusco that day,</v>

2246
00:57:12.100 --> 00:57:16.060
<v Speaker 6>you probably usually don't feel like taking the train because the best time to</v>

2247
00:57:16.061 --> 00:57:17.470
<v Speaker 6>goes in the morning to get the whole day.</v>

2248
00:57:17.770 --> 00:57:18.340
<v Speaker 6>So you,</v>

2249
00:57:18.340 --> 00:57:19.390
<v Speaker 6>you stay a couple of days,</v>

2250
00:57:19.630 --> 00:57:20.650
<v Speaker 6>you get on a train,</v>

2251
00:57:21.080 --> 00:57:21.911
<v Speaker 6>you take the train ride,</v>

2252
00:57:21.911 --> 00:57:23.230
<v Speaker 6>then you get the bus up the hill,</v>

2253
00:57:23.290 --> 00:57:25.270
<v Speaker 6>and then when you arrive at the,</v>

2254
00:57:25.300 --> 00:57:25.801
<v Speaker 6>you arrive at,</v>

2255
00:57:25.801 --> 00:57:25.960
<v Speaker 6>at,</v>

2256
00:57:25.960 --> 00:57:29.890
<v Speaker 6>at the top and you are just a,</v>

2257
00:57:29.920 --> 00:57:30.690
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2258
00:57:30.690 --> 00:57:34.270
<v Speaker 6>let's say a hundred yards or something from where the actual Machu Picchu,</v>

2259
00:57:34.271 --> 00:57:34.931
<v Speaker 6>the city as you're at,</v>

2260
00:57:34.931 --> 00:57:37.690
<v Speaker 6>you're at the receiving area and you walk over and it's,</v>

2261
00:57:38.140 --> 00:57:39.040
<v Speaker 6>it just blows your mind,</v>

2262
00:57:39.041 --> 00:57:39.191
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

2263
00:57:39.191 --> 00:57:39.731
<v Speaker 6>There's nothing,</v>

2264
00:57:39.731 --> 00:57:40.520
<v Speaker 6>I mean there's,</v>

2265
00:57:40.520 --> 00:57:41.680
<v Speaker 6>there's no way to describe it.</v>

2266
00:57:41.681 --> 00:57:43.000
<v Speaker 6>There's a city,</v>

2267
00:57:43.030 --> 00:57:45.490
<v Speaker 6>an ancient city way up,</v>

2268
00:57:45.491 --> 00:57:46.600
<v Speaker 6>thousands of feet,</v>

2269
00:57:46.601 --> 00:57:51.601
<v Speaker 6>7,000 feet up in the mountains and it's elaborate.</v>

2270
00:57:52.120 --> 00:57:53.110
<v Speaker 6>It's precise.</v>

2271
00:57:53.480 --> 00:57:55.540
<v Speaker 6>There's reasons for the placement of things.</v>

2272
00:57:55.541 --> 00:57:57.220
<v Speaker 6>The Sun hits certain parts of it,</v>

2273
00:57:57.221 --> 00:57:58.031
<v Speaker 6>certain ways,</v>

2274
00:57:58.031 --> 00:57:59.140
<v Speaker 6>and you're just like,</v>

2275
00:57:59.141 --> 00:57:59.351
<v Speaker 6>we're,</v>

2276
00:57:59.351 --> 00:58:00.310
<v Speaker 6>we're way up.</v>

2277
00:58:00.790 --> 00:58:01.410
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2278
00:58:01.410 --> 00:58:05.470
<v Speaker 6>like you're looking down from the top of a mountain in a city and there it was</v>

2279
00:58:05.530 --> 00:58:08.260
<v Speaker 6>inhabited and fully functioning and you know,</v>

2280
00:58:08.261 --> 00:58:08.980
<v Speaker 6>it's just,</v>

2281
00:58:08.980 --> 00:58:09.510
<v Speaker 6>like I said,</v>

2282
00:58:09.510 --> 00:58:10.690
<v Speaker 6>the size of the place,</v>

2283
00:58:10.691 --> 00:58:11.920
<v Speaker 6>of the magnitude of it all,</v>

2284
00:58:12.310 --> 00:58:13.081
<v Speaker 6>it blows your mind.</v>

2285
00:58:13.081 --> 00:58:13.330
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>

2286
00:58:13.330 --> 00:58:14.290
<v Speaker 6>there's nothing like event.</v>

2287
00:58:14.950 --> 00:58:15.930
<v Speaker 6>How long were you up there for?</v>

2288
00:58:16.750 --> 00:58:17.590
<v Speaker 6>I would spend,</v>

2289
00:58:18.880 --> 00:58:19.420
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2290
00:58:19.420 --> 00:58:20.171
<v Speaker 6>hours like,</v>

2291
00:58:20.171 --> 00:58:20.500
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2292
00:58:20.500 --> 00:58:21.820
<v Speaker 6>you arrive in the morning,</v>

2293
00:58:21.970 --> 00:58:24.470
<v Speaker 6>let's say you're there by like a guide or something like that takes you yeah.</v>

2294
00:58:24.480 --> 00:58:24.801
<v Speaker 6>And they,</v>

2295
00:58:24.801 --> 00:58:26.720
<v Speaker 6>and they have so much information.</v>

2296
00:58:26.750 --> 00:58:27.401
<v Speaker 6>Blows your mind.</v>

2297
00:58:27.401 --> 00:58:28.990
<v Speaker 6>Like how old did they say it is?</v>

2298
00:58:29.310 --> 00:58:30.143
<v Speaker 6>Ah,</v>

2299
00:58:30.160 --> 00:58:31.210
<v Speaker 6>I'm trying to remember.</v>

2300
00:58:31.211 --> 00:58:33.640
<v Speaker 6>I haven't been there in a while now,</v>

2301
00:58:33.641 --> 00:58:37.600
<v Speaker 6>but I want to say that they said well because it's documented when the Spanish</v>

2302
00:58:37.601 --> 00:58:42.100
<v Speaker 6>went there and killed like thousands of them with like a hundred guys,</v>

2303
00:58:42.460 --> 00:58:42.850
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2304
00:58:42.850 --> 00:58:43.683
<v Speaker 6>because uh,</v>

2305
00:58:43.840 --> 00:58:47.110
<v Speaker 6>they came with disease and weapon and they just wiped them out.</v>

2306
00:58:47.420 --> 00:58:50.340
<v Speaker 6>I was in Hawaii last week and uh,</v>

2307
00:58:50.420 --> 00:58:51.460
<v Speaker 6>we were reading about,</v>

2308
00:58:51.490 --> 00:58:51.760
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

2309
00:58:51.760 --> 00:58:52.061
<v Speaker 6>when,</v>

2310
00:58:52.061 --> 00:58:54.190
<v Speaker 6>when white people first came to Hawaii,</v>

2311
00:58:54.950 --> 00:58:57.700
<v Speaker 6>it killed off one fifth of the Hawaiian population.</v>

2312
00:58:57.730 --> 00:58:58.141
<v Speaker 6>Damn.</v>

2313
00:58:58.141 --> 00:58:59.550
<v Speaker 6>Cause that's these people.</v>

2314
00:58:59.560 --> 00:59:00.330
<v Speaker 6>One fifth.</v>

2315
00:59:00.330 --> 00:59:00.700
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2316
00:59:00.700 --> 00:59:03.730
<v Speaker 6>Can you imagine how much you would fucking hate white people if they showed up</v>

2317
00:59:03.731 --> 00:59:07.570
<v Speaker 6>and your daughter died from measles because these creeps brought over some</v>

2318
00:59:07.571 --> 00:59:08.800
<v Speaker 6>creepy fucking disease.</v>

2319
00:59:09.130 --> 00:59:09.570
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2320
00:59:09.570 --> 00:59:09.860
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>

2321
00:59:09.860 --> 00:59:10.200
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

2322
00:59:10.200 --> 00:59:10.620
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

2323
00:59:10.620 --> 00:59:10.831
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

2324
00:59:10.831 --> 00:59:11.180
<v Speaker 6>it,</v>

2325
00:59:11.180 --> 00:59:11.710
<v Speaker 6>it,</v>

2326
00:59:11.710 --> 00:59:11.921
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

2327
00:59:11.921 --> 00:59:13.150
<v Speaker 6>well that's well documented.</v>

2328
00:59:13.151 --> 00:59:13.930
<v Speaker 6>We could look that up.</v>

2329
00:59:13.930 --> 00:59:14.763
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>

2330
00:59:14.800 --> 00:59:16.300
<v Speaker 6>I want to say they,</v>

2331
00:59:16.450 --> 00:59:19.750
<v Speaker 6>it was like thousands to one that they killed them.</v>

2332
00:59:20.410 --> 00:59:22.280
<v Speaker 6>And that was in the 15.</v>

2333
00:59:22.400 --> 00:59:23.300
<v Speaker 6>I want to say 15,</v>

2334
00:59:23.301 --> 00:59:24.410
<v Speaker 6>13 or 15 to 60.</v>

2335
00:59:24.411 --> 00:59:25.041
<v Speaker 6>Something like that.</v>

2336
00:59:25.041 --> 00:59:26.180
<v Speaker 6>Just make some shit up bro.</v>

2337
00:59:26.240 --> 00:59:27.450
<v Speaker 6>No one's going to go and look it up.</v>

2338
00:59:27.490 --> 00:59:28.010
<v Speaker 6>Fucking,</v>

2339
00:59:28.010 --> 00:59:28.850
<v Speaker 6>I was going to Google it.</v>

2340
00:59:28.851 --> 00:59:29.220
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>

2341
00:59:29.220 --> 00:59:30.053
<v Speaker 6>They,</v>

2342
00:59:31.550 --> 00:59:32.510
<v Speaker 6>I'm not an expert.</v>

2343
00:59:32.690 --> 00:59:33.300
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>

2344
00:59:33.300 --> 00:59:33.920
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

2345
00:59:33.920 --> 00:59:34.760
<v Speaker 6>when you go up there,</v>

2346
00:59:34.761 --> 00:59:35.930
<v Speaker 6>so they give you some sort of a,</v>

2347
00:59:35.931 --> 00:59:37.760
<v Speaker 6>an estimation of when it was created,</v>

2348
00:59:37.761 --> 00:59:40.610
<v Speaker 6>did they tell you who the people were or why they built it?</v>

2349
00:59:41.450 --> 00:59:41.991
<v Speaker 6>They give you,</v>

2350
00:59:41.991 --> 00:59:42.740
<v Speaker 6>it's all theories.</v>

2351
00:59:42.740 --> 00:59:43.001
<v Speaker 6>There's,</v>

2352
00:59:43.001 --> 00:59:44.120
<v Speaker 6>it's never been discovered.</v>

2353
00:59:44.121 --> 00:59:46.420
<v Speaker 6>And they tell you that their theories because that you,</v>

2354
00:59:46.640 --> 00:59:50.480
<v Speaker 6>there's no record to prove that this was in fact the way they did it.</v>

2355
00:59:50.481 --> 00:59:51.080
<v Speaker 6>But like,</v>

2356
00:59:51.080 --> 00:59:52.550
<v Speaker 6>so was it one thing sorta when they,</v>

2357
00:59:52.560 --> 00:59:53.660
<v Speaker 6>they're just sort of found it.</v>

2358
00:59:53.690 --> 00:59:54.110
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2359
00:59:54.110 --> 00:59:54.830
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2360
00:59:54.830 --> 00:59:55.280
<v Speaker 6>It was,</v>

2361
00:59:55.280 --> 00:59:59.420
<v Speaker 6>it was discovered in the early 19 hundreds by like an explorer and American</v>

2362
00:59:59.421 --> 00:59:59.811
<v Speaker 6>explorer,</v>

2363
00:59:59.811 --> 01:00:00.390
<v Speaker 6>I think,</v>

2364
01:00:00.390 --> 01:00:02.060
<v Speaker 6>kind a British and he,</v>

2365
01:00:02.061 --> 01:00:02.241
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2366
01:00:02.241 --> 01:00:02.451
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2367
01:00:02.451 --> 01:00:02.751
<v Speaker 6>it had,</v>

2368
01:00:02.751 --> 01:00:03.710
<v Speaker 6>it was overgrown,</v>

2369
01:00:04.030 --> 01:00:06.110
<v Speaker 6>like weeds and grass and everything had to grown.</v>

2370
01:00:06.170 --> 01:00:06.890
<v Speaker 6>And then,</v>

2371
01:00:06.890 --> 01:00:07.131
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>

2372
01:00:07.131 --> 01:00:09.950
<v Speaker 6>Can you imagine you're on a hike and then they take you to see this and you're</v>

2373
01:00:09.951 --> 01:00:10.161
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

2374
01:00:10.161 --> 01:00:12.050
<v Speaker 6>what the fuck man,</v>

2375
01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:15.380
<v Speaker 6>but a sudden you just find some lost city,</v>

2376
01:00:15.400 --> 01:00:18.470
<v Speaker 6>the lost city man from thousands of years ago where yield loss.</v>

2377
01:00:18.740 --> 01:00:20.270
<v Speaker 6>I wish I could remember what the,</v>

2378
01:00:20.271 --> 01:00:21.104
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2379
01:00:21.110 --> 01:00:25.730
<v Speaker 6>the chariots of the gods slash Graham Hancock crew thinks,</v>

2380
01:00:25.750 --> 01:00:25.960
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2381
01:00:25.960 --> 01:00:28.340
<v Speaker 6>about this place because I think there's some,</v>

2382
01:00:28.370 --> 01:00:31.430
<v Speaker 6>there is some sort of speculation that it was at the side of water at one point</v>

2383
01:00:31.431 --> 01:00:32.000
<v Speaker 6>in time.</v>

2384
01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:32.420
<v Speaker 6>Really?</v>

2385
01:00:32.420 --> 01:00:32.920
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2386
01:00:32.920 --> 01:00:33.591
<v Speaker 6>That you know,</v>

2387
01:00:33.591 --> 01:00:37.100
<v Speaker 6>that the topography of the earth was so radically different when this thing was</v>

2388
01:00:37.101 --> 01:00:40.280
<v Speaker 6>created that it's so many thousands of years old that there was actually a water</v>

2389
01:00:40.281 --> 01:00:43.400
<v Speaker 6>up there with this guy wants to do is as John Anthony West Guy,</v>

2390
01:00:43.401 --> 01:00:48.401
<v Speaker 6>he wants to push back the idea of civilization like more like more than 10,000</v>

2391
01:00:48.411 --> 01:00:48.861
<v Speaker 6>BC.</v>

2392
01:00:48.861 --> 01:00:49.880
<v Speaker 6>He wants to go like way back,</v>

2393
01:00:49.881 --> 01:00:54.881
<v Speaker 6>even like 30,000 BC and he thinks that theirs is sort of a hieroglyphs that</v>

2394
01:00:55.431 --> 01:00:56.181
<v Speaker 6>represent that.</v>

2395
01:00:56.181 --> 01:00:57.680
<v Speaker 6>But for whatever reasons,</v>

2396
01:00:57.710 --> 01:01:01.520
<v Speaker 6>Egyptian scholars of refuse to look at those hieroglyphs and they believe that</v>

2397
01:01:01.521 --> 01:01:04.940
<v Speaker 6>it's all fiction after a certain point and it's just a fiction and fable.</v>

2398
01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:05.661
<v Speaker 6>When he's saying,</v>

2399
01:01:05.661 --> 01:01:05.871
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

2400
01:01:05.871 --> 01:01:06.860
<v Speaker 6>why would you think that?</v>

2401
01:01:06.861 --> 01:01:09.950
<v Speaker 6>Because there's all this other evidence that we know is real.</v>

2402
01:01:10.070 --> 01:01:11.300
<v Speaker 6>It's also in the hieroglyphs.</v>

2403
01:01:11.301 --> 01:01:11.661
<v Speaker 6>Why wouldn't,</v>

2404
01:01:11.661 --> 01:01:13.970
<v Speaker 6>why would we assume that at one point in time they were just liars,</v>

2405
01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:14.380
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>

2406
01:01:14.380 --> 01:01:14.690
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2407
01:01:14.690 --> 01:01:15.410
<v Speaker 6>So it's Kinda,</v>

2408
01:01:15.410 --> 01:01:17.000
<v Speaker 6>did you fuck this new one up again?</v>

2409
01:01:18.590 --> 01:01:19.550
<v Speaker 6>It's still broken.</v>

2410
01:01:19.551 --> 01:01:20.480
<v Speaker 6>We got to number one though.</v>

2411
01:01:20.570 --> 01:01:21.480
<v Speaker 6>I know it never really,</v>

2412
01:01:21.481 --> 01:01:22.480
<v Speaker 6>the new one doesn't work either.</v>

2413
01:01:22.481 --> 01:01:23.880
<v Speaker 6>Now God damn it son.</v>

2414
01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:25.273
<v Speaker 6>Anyway,</v>

2415
01:01:26.140 --> 01:01:26.973
<v Speaker 6>those guys are right.</v>

2416
01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:30.830
<v Speaker 6>And it was like 30,000 years ago or whatever the hell it was where there was a</v>

2417
01:01:30.831 --> 01:01:34.100
<v Speaker 6>civilization up here and there was an ocean up there or river or whatever the</v>

2418
01:01:34.101 --> 01:01:34.930
<v Speaker 6>hell it was.</v>

2419
01:01:34.930 --> 01:01:35.160
<v Speaker 6>Is it,</v>

2420
01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:36.020
<v Speaker 6>and it's not near Ocean,</v>

2421
01:01:36.021 --> 01:01:36.350
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

2422
01:01:36.350 --> 01:01:37.040
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

2423
01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:37.371
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

2424
01:01:37.371 --> 01:01:37.730
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2425
01:01:37.730 --> 01:01:38.000
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

2426
01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:38.530
<v Speaker 6>not,</v>

2427
01:01:38.530 --> 01:01:40.490
<v Speaker 6>I would have to be some giant lake or something out there,</v>

2428
01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:44.270
<v Speaker 6>but they have one of their theories is that they used water to lay those rocks</v>

2429
01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:48.140
<v Speaker 6>and to make them to shape them like through some extremely,</v>

2430
01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:49.430
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2431
01:01:49.430 --> 01:01:49.760
<v Speaker 6>I dunno.</v>

2432
01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:52.790
<v Speaker 6>Intricate formula that water,</v>

2433
01:01:52.820 --> 01:01:53.990
<v Speaker 6>cause you know like water hits,</v>

2434
01:01:53.991 --> 01:01:55.490
<v Speaker 6>rocks and shapes them over time.</v>

2435
01:01:55.500 --> 01:01:55.770
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

2436
01:01:55.770 --> 01:01:56.900
<v Speaker 6>To beat them down to sand.</v>

2437
01:01:57.200 --> 01:02:02.200
<v Speaker 6>They have a theory that that water was used to make rocks like this fit into</v>

2438
01:02:02.961 --> 01:02:03.710
<v Speaker 6>each other.</v>

2439
01:02:03.710 --> 01:02:05.520
<v Speaker 6>But there's some elaborate system that you,</v>

2440
01:02:05.530 --> 01:02:06.890
<v Speaker 6>you hear about it and you go like,</v>

2441
01:02:07.310 --> 01:02:07.491
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

2442
01:02:07.491 --> 01:02:08.271
<v Speaker 6>I don't fucking know man.</v>

2443
01:02:08.271 --> 01:02:08.960
<v Speaker 6>That's pretty,</v>

2444
01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:11.600
<v Speaker 6>the sheer size of them is what's really mind boggling.</v>

2445
01:02:11.601 --> 01:02:12.790
<v Speaker 6>It really has been there.</v>

2446
01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:13.251
<v Speaker 6>The eight,</v>

2447
01:02:13.251 --> 01:02:15.860
<v Speaker 6>nine feet tall and they're curved and they,</v>

2448
01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:20.710
<v Speaker 6>and they fit into other curved garage and thousands of thousand tons.</v>

2449
01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:21.280
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2450
01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:21.520
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2451
01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:22.300
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

2452
01:02:22.300 --> 01:02:23.610
<v Speaker 6>I don't know thousands of times.</v>

2453
01:02:23.820 --> 01:02:24.653
<v Speaker 6>What's the biggest one?</v>

2454
01:02:24.990 --> 01:02:25.830
<v Speaker 6>I should know this.</v>

2455
01:02:25.831 --> 01:02:27.120
<v Speaker 6>We should know that we're talking shit,</v>

2456
01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:27.640
<v Speaker 6>but they,</v>

2457
01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:27.990
<v Speaker 6>there are,</v>

2458
01:02:27.990 --> 01:02:29.430
<v Speaker 6>there are enormous stones up there.</v>

2459
01:02:29.431 --> 01:02:30.270
<v Speaker 6>Whatever the fuck it is.</v>

2460
01:02:30.300 --> 01:02:32.040
<v Speaker 6>I highly recommend a trip there.</v>

2461
01:02:32.940 --> 01:02:34.050
<v Speaker 6>You're making me want to go.</v>

01:02:34.070 --> 01:02:35.080
<v Speaker 6>I really it so far.</v>

2463
01:02:35.090 --> 01:02:37.110

2464
01:02:37.111 --> 01:02:37.651
<v Speaker 6>before you,</v>

<v Speaker 6>here's water.</v>

2471
01:02:46.350 --> 01:02:47.970

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:57.833
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2484
01:02:57.960 --> 01:02:58.380
<v Speaker 6>peruse,</v>

2485
01:02:58.380 --> 01:02:59.370
<v Speaker 6>considered a third world,</v>

2486
01:02:59.371 --> 01:03:00.270
<v Speaker 6>but like it's,</v>

2487
01:03:00.540 --> 01:03:02.430
<v Speaker 6>it's actually really developed now.</v>

2488
01:03:02.500 --> 01:03:02.940
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2489
01:03:02.940 --> 01:03:03.241
<v Speaker 6>this is,</v>

2490
01:03:03.241 --> 01:03:03.421
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>

2491
01:03:03.421 --> 01:03:07.950
<v Speaker 6>And this is such a international destination that like everything is like</v>

2492
01:03:07.951 --> 01:03:08.580
<v Speaker 6>modern,</v>

2493
01:03:08.580 --> 01:03:08.881
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2494
01:03:08.881 --> 01:03:10.920
<v Speaker 6>like as far as getting you there.</v>

2495
01:03:10.921 --> 01:03:14.300
<v Speaker 6>And I mean the last time I went was 10 years ago and you know,</v>

2496
01:03:14.340 --> 01:03:15.750
<v Speaker 6>it was still pretty much,</v>

2497
01:03:15.751 --> 01:03:18.330
<v Speaker 6>but there's a hotel at the location if you want to stay over night,</v>

2498
01:03:18.660 --> 01:03:20.010
<v Speaker 6>there's a hotel right there.</v>

2499
01:03:20.310 --> 01:03:21.600
<v Speaker 6>So like not like,</v>

2500
01:03:21.630 --> 01:03:22.050
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2501
01:03:22.050 --> 01:03:23.790
<v Speaker 6>not within the city of Machu Picchu,</v>

2502
01:03:23.791 --> 01:03:24.480
<v Speaker 6>but right.</v>

2503
01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:25.860
<v Speaker 6>Kind of not far from it.</v>

2504
01:03:26.130 --> 01:03:30.960
<v Speaker 6>So you can stay in the hotel like it's very not ghost in the middle of the</v>

2505
01:03:30.960 --> 01:03:31.150
<v Speaker 6>night.</v>

2506
01:03:31.150 --> 01:03:35.100
<v Speaker 6>It's sword fights and thousands years ago really like affects you.</v>

2507
01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:36.540
<v Speaker 6>It affects you really.</v>

2508
01:03:36.570 --> 01:03:37.080
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2509
01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:37.291
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2510
01:03:37.291 --> 01:03:37.810
<v Speaker 6>Like you,</v>

2511
01:03:37.810 --> 01:03:38.970
<v Speaker 6>you stay in there and you take it in.</v>

2512
01:03:38.971 --> 01:03:42.570
<v Speaker 6>You're looking at it like you're looking at the sky and the mountains and you're</v>

2513
01:03:42.571 --> 01:03:43.404
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

2514
01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:43.830
<v Speaker 6>what?</v>

2515
01:03:43.830 --> 01:03:45.450
<v Speaker 6>Like how is this possible?</v>

2516
01:03:45.451 --> 01:03:45.811
<v Speaker 6>Cause it,</v>

2517
01:03:45.811 --> 01:03:46.260
<v Speaker 6>it,</v>

2518
01:03:46.260 --> 01:03:47.190
<v Speaker 6>it blows your mind.</v>

2519
01:03:47.191 --> 01:03:51.450
<v Speaker 6>And in terms of like most things that you look at,</v>

2520
01:03:51.900 --> 01:03:54.600
<v Speaker 6>there's so many like explanations and answers for,</v>

2521
01:03:54.601 --> 01:03:55.890
<v Speaker 6>and this is something where they're really,</v>

2522
01:03:56.190 --> 01:03:57.060
<v Speaker 6>you really don't have one.</v>

2523
01:03:57.061 --> 01:03:57.894
<v Speaker 6>Like you can't,</v>

2524
01:03:58.380 --> 01:04:02.310
<v Speaker 6>you can't have somebody to tell you this is exactly what this was.</v>

2525
01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:06.060
<v Speaker 6>So it then why did he say he can't just because it's just too nutty,</v>

2526
01:04:06.061 --> 01:04:07.060
<v Speaker 6>too big because,</v>

2527
01:04:07.090 --> 01:04:09.060
<v Speaker 6>and because there's no proof that,</v>

2528
01:04:09.420 --> 01:04:12.300
<v Speaker 6>that it was used for this and it was built this way.</v>

2529
01:04:12.330 --> 01:04:13.290
<v Speaker 6>They're all theories,</v>

2530
01:04:13.580 --> 01:04:14.730
<v Speaker 6>theories on why this was done.</v>

2531
01:04:14.731 --> 01:04:16.830
<v Speaker 6>And so that then opens your mind up to like,</v>

2532
01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:19.170
<v Speaker 6>really what are possibilities?</v>

2533
01:04:19.170 --> 01:04:19.471
<v Speaker 6>I think,</v>

2534
01:04:19.471 --> 01:04:19.711
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2535
01:04:19.711 --> 01:04:21.660
<v Speaker 6>like what are possibilities in the world?</v>

2536
01:04:21.661 --> 01:04:22.494
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

2537
01:04:22.500 --> 01:04:22.830
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2538
01:04:22.830 --> 01:04:24.990
<v Speaker 6>what are the possibilities that you got from,</v>

2539
01:04:25.010 --> 01:04:26.640
<v Speaker 6>from being there looking at that,</v>

2540
01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:27.361
<v Speaker 6>just that,</v>

2541
01:04:27.361 --> 01:04:28.320
<v Speaker 6>that um,</v>

2542
01:04:28.500 --> 01:04:30.450
<v Speaker 6>it was underwater and mermaids built it.</v>

2543
01:04:30.650 --> 01:04:30.860
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

2544
01:04:30.860 --> 01:04:32.820
<v Speaker 6>I just got that it was something that,</v>

2545
01:04:32.850 --> 01:04:33.241
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2546
01:04:33.241 --> 01:04:34.074
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2547
01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:39.250
<v Speaker 6>that it's greater than what my mind can conceive of a,</v>

2548
01:04:39.270 --> 01:04:43.170
<v Speaker 6>it makes you feel like really small,</v>

2549
01:04:43.200 --> 01:04:43.531
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2550
01:04:43.531 --> 01:04:43.671
<v Speaker 6>in,</v>

2551
01:04:43.671 --> 01:04:46.170
<v Speaker 6>in a lot of terms like just by the scope of it.</v>

2552
01:04:46.171 --> 01:04:47.580
<v Speaker 6>And like if,</v>

2553
01:04:47.640 --> 01:04:52.640
<v Speaker 6>if this was done by some intricate like Levy and pulling system with water like</v>

2554
01:04:53.700 --> 01:04:54.180

01:05:38.860 --> 01:05:39.320
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2585
01:05:39.320 --> 01:05:42.490
<v Speaker 6>worshiping him or they sacrificed and could sacrificed.</v>

2586
01:05:42.850 --> 01:05:46.000
<v Speaker 6>Do you know they would kill their own offer him up.</v>

2587
01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:47.710
<v Speaker 6>Jesus Christ.</v>

2588
01:05:47.770 --> 01:05:48.603
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2589
01:05:48.610 --> 01:05:49.361
<v Speaker 6>It's pretty amazing,</v>

2590
01:05:49.361 --> 01:05:49.890
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

2591
01:05:49.890 --> 01:05:51.780
<v Speaker 4>I wonder what made them build those things.</v>

2592
01:05:51.781 --> 01:05:52.251
<v Speaker 4>So when,</v>

2593
01:05:52.251 --> 01:05:52.480
<v Speaker 4>when,</v>

2594
01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:57.480
<v Speaker 4>what I would think as far as it being very spiritual to be there and the terms</v>

2595
01:05:57.760 --> 01:06:02.760
<v Speaker 4>of what I mean by spiritual is that if a spirit was real and if there is some</v>

2596
01:06:04.111 --> 01:06:06.070
<v Speaker 4>sort of an energy that's inside of a life form,</v>

2597
01:06:06.100 --> 01:06:10.230
<v Speaker 4>that energy like leaves and stays in that space once the person's gone.</v>

2598
01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:12.450
<v Speaker 4>When you go to a place like a Machu Picchu,</v>

2599
01:06:12.451 --> 01:06:16.110
<v Speaker 4>when you think about all of the thousands of years of history and all the people</v>

2600
01:06:16.111 --> 01:06:16.944
<v Speaker 4>that have died,</v>

2601
01:06:17.250 --> 01:06:19.330
<v Speaker 4>all the people that died in that area and what,</v>

2602
01:06:19.331 --> 01:06:19.590
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

2603
01:06:19.590 --> 01:06:24.590
<v Speaker 4>you know how long ago it was like if there was ever any feeling you could get of</v>

2604
01:06:26.221 --> 01:06:27.630
<v Speaker 4>like the spirit of a place,</v>

2605
01:06:27.750 --> 01:06:30.270
<v Speaker 4>it would have to be some sort of an really,</v>

2606
01:06:30.271 --> 01:06:31.980
<v Speaker 4>really ancient place.</v>

2607
01:06:32.490 --> 01:06:33.071
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2608
01:06:33.071 --> 01:06:33.101
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>

2609
01:06:33.101 --> 01:06:35.580
<v Speaker 4>a place along those lines like standing,</v>

2610
01:06:35.581 --> 01:06:40.581
<v Speaker 4>like we're Troy is walking around the coliseum and the touching the Parthenon,</v>

2611
01:06:41.161 --> 01:06:41.994
<v Speaker 4>like shit like that.</v>

2612
01:06:42.120 --> 01:06:43.350
<v Speaker 4>Like can you go to like really,</v>

2613
01:06:43.351 --> 01:06:45.240
<v Speaker 4>really ancient places like that?</v>

2614
01:06:45.390 --> 01:06:45.721
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

2615
01:06:45.721 --> 01:06:46.170
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2616
01:06:46.170 --> 01:06:49.170
<v Speaker 4>I know it's a different term when you say like spiritual,</v>

2617
01:06:49.500 --> 01:06:53.610
<v Speaker 4>but it's kind of like this gotta be like a certain energy to those places.</v>

2618
01:06:53.770 --> 01:06:55.020
<v Speaker 4>If you really believe in that,</v>

2619
01:06:55.021 --> 01:06:58.410
<v Speaker 4>if you really believe that human energy stays in the area when the,</v>

2620
01:06:58.411 --> 01:06:59.220
<v Speaker 4>when the person is,</v>

2621
01:06:59.220 --> 01:06:59.620
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>

2622
01:06:59.620 --> 01:07:00.450
<v Speaker 4>is killed,</v>

2623
01:07:00.450 --> 01:07:02.640
<v Speaker 4>which people believe when they believe that houses are haunted,</v>

2624
01:07:02.910 --> 01:07:03.060
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2625
01:07:03.060 --> 01:07:04.530
<v Speaker 4>I know a lot of people that you tell them,</v>

2626
01:07:04.531 --> 01:07:04.741
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

2627

2628
01:07:06.530 --> 01:07:06.780

2629
01:07:06.780 --> 01:07:07.890
<v Speaker 4>go get the fuck outta here.</v>

2630
01:07:08.070 --> 01:07:08.430
<v Speaker 4>Like I'll do,</v>

2631
01:07:08.430 --> 01:07:09.270
<v Speaker 4>it's the best house ever.</v>

2632
01:07:09.271 --> 01:07:09.781
<v Speaker 4>It's beautiful.</v>

2633
01:07:09.781 --> 01:07:11.790
<v Speaker 4>It's only like half what it would be worth.</v>

2634
01:07:11.791 --> 01:07:13.920
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't Jon Benet Ramsey still still still be like,</v>

2635
01:07:13.921 --> 01:07:14.760

01:07:15.030 --> 01:07:16.140
<v Speaker 4>I'm not living in that house.</v>

2637
01:07:16.230 --> 01:07:16.501
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>

2638
01:07:16.501 --> 01:07:19.410
<v Speaker 4>Because they think that there might be some energy in that house.</v>

2639
01:07:19.411 --> 01:07:20.790
<v Speaker 4>There's something leftover.</v>

2640
01:07:21.660 --> 01:07:21.931

01:07:22.740 --> 01:07:26.820

2645
01:07:26.821 --> 01:07:27.061
<v Speaker 6>get.</v>

2646
01:07:27.061 --> 01:07:30.360
<v Speaker 6>Like you feel something when you're in that presence,</v>

2647
01:07:30.361 --> 01:07:31.500
<v Speaker 6>like that type of greatness,</v>

2648
01:07:31.890 --> 01:07:34.650

<v Speaker 6>like a formal,</v>

01:10:42.021 --> 01:10:43.370
<v Speaker 6>like you're on trial,</v>

<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2761
01:10:50.750 --> 01:10:55.750

<v Speaker 6>Holy Shit.</v>

2771

2784
01:11:26.521 --> 01:11:31.380
<v Speaker 5>there was no internet videos from 1999 with you talking about the apocalypse and</v>

2788
01:11:41.820 --> 01:11:43.110
<v Speaker 5>from that time period?</v>

2789
01:11:43.710 --> 01:11:44.471

<v Speaker 5>we have,</v>

2807
01:12:01.171 --> 01:12:02.004

2809
01:12:06.990 --> 01:12:11.370

<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2819
01:12:21.211 --> 01:12:24.780
<v Speaker 5>And it's like if they were a hundred dudes without a country,</v>

2820
01:12:24.781 --> 01:12:25.980
<v Speaker 5>they would just be pirates.</v>

2821
01:12:26.190 --> 01:12:26.410
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2822
01:12:26.410 --> 01:12:27.540
<v Speaker 5>No one would take them seriously.</v>

2823
01:12:27.541 --> 01:12:29.940
<v Speaker 5>They'd be a band of pirates and Ruffins but instead,</v>

2824
01:12:29.941 --> 01:12:31.770
<v Speaker 5>history actually looks upon it as,</v>

2825
01:12:31.800 --> 01:12:32.520
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2826
01:12:32.520 --> 01:12:34.620
<v Speaker 5>almost like a qualified act.</v>

2827
01:12:34.950 --> 01:12:35.191
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

2828
01:12:35.191 --> 01:12:35.431
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2829
01:12:35.431 --> 01:12:35.701
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2830
01:12:35.701 --> 01:12:37.500
<v Speaker 5>they were Spain attacked this,</v>

2831
01:12:37.710 --> 01:12:37.980
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2832
01:12:37.980 --> 01:12:38.521
<v Speaker 5>instead of,</v>

2833
01:12:38.521 --> 01:12:38.761
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2834
01:12:38.761 --> 01:12:39.180
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

2835
01:12:39.180 --> 01:12:39.660
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2836
01:12:39.660 --> 01:12:43.830
<v Speaker 5>black beard and his gang of thugs tried to take over at North Carolina,</v>

2837
01:12:44.180 --> 01:12:44.550
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2838
01:12:44.550 --> 01:12:45.331
<v Speaker 5>instead of that,</v>

2839
01:12:45.331 --> 01:12:45.920
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

2840
01:12:45.920 --> 01:12:47.280
<v Speaker 5>it's not the whole country.</v>

2841
01:12:47.281 --> 01:12:50.370
<v Speaker 5>So it's qualified as thuggish when it's super thuggish,</v>

2842
01:12:50.430 --> 01:12:51.700
<v Speaker 5>it's totally thuggish.</v>

2843
01:12:51.960 --> 01:12:53.430
<v Speaker 5>It's the most gangster shit ever.</v>

2844
01:12:53.431 --> 01:12:55.800
<v Speaker 5>100 dudes take over the fucking whole country.</v>

2845
01:12:55.980 --> 01:12:56.940
<v Speaker 5>Unbelievable man.</v>

2846
01:12:56.941 --> 01:12:57.240
<v Speaker 5>Shit.</v>

2847
01:12:57.240 --> 01:12:58.080
<v Speaker 5>That's insane,</v>

2848
01:12:58.081 --> 01:12:58.560
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

2849
01:12:58.560 --> 01:12:59.580
<v Speaker 5>That's hard to believe.</v>

2850
01:12:59.581 --> 01:13:02.750
<v Speaker 5>They have rapid fire guns back then or was it a muscle?</v>

2851
01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:03.190
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2852
01:13:03.190 --> 01:13:03.390
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2853
01:13:03.390 --> 01:13:04.280
<v Speaker 5>they did it with Moscow.</v>

2854
01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:07.890
<v Speaker 5>He took over with muskets.</v>

2855
01:13:08.340 --> 01:13:11.100
<v Speaker 5>How stressful that would be like somebody who's like running right towards you</v>

2856
01:13:11.101 --> 01:13:12.950
<v Speaker 5>and you're just trying to fucking fill your muscles.</v>

2857
01:13:13.110 --> 01:13:15.930
<v Speaker 5>It's also the case though that when the Spaniards came,</v>

2858
01:13:15.931 --> 01:13:17.010
<v Speaker 5>there was a lot of confusion.</v>

2859
01:13:17.011 --> 01:13:20.040
<v Speaker 5>They thought the Spaniards were gods and so they'll let them in.</v>

2860
01:13:20.130 --> 01:13:20.401
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2861
01:13:20.401 --> 01:13:21.860
<v Speaker 5>I think the Spanish took off,</v>

2862
01:13:21.900 --> 01:13:23.520
<v Speaker 5>took over and started killing people.</v>

2863
01:13:23.550 --> 01:13:24.510
<v Speaker 5>I think of Cortez,</v>

2864
01:13:24.511 --> 01:13:24.691
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2865
01:13:24.691 --> 01:13:25.620
<v Speaker 5>It might be Cortez.</v>

2866
01:13:25.860 --> 01:13:26.693
<v Speaker 5>Is that Cortez?</v>

2867
01:13:26.730 --> 01:13:27.563
<v Speaker 5>My fucking,</v>

2868
01:13:28.620 --> 01:13:31.020
<v Speaker 5>my mind history is completely limited.</v>

2869
01:13:31.021 --> 01:13:32.040
<v Speaker 5>My Aztec history,</v>

2870
01:13:32.160 --> 01:13:33.480
<v Speaker 5>all I know is the cool shit.</v>

2871
01:13:33.481 --> 01:13:37.140
<v Speaker 5>Like can't Kukula [inaudible] was the snake with the fucking feathers bro.</v>

2872
01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:38.610
<v Speaker 5>Like I know shit like that.</v>

2873
01:13:39.520 --> 01:13:41.160
<v Speaker 5>Well that's all Quadel.</v>

2874
01:13:41.220 --> 01:13:43.770
<v Speaker 5>I know they had a lot of them hadn't seen horses so they thought they were like,</v>

2875
01:13:43.771 --> 01:13:44.790
<v Speaker 5>I saw horses and they were like,</v>

2876
01:13:44.791 --> 01:13:45.500
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck?</v>

2877
01:13:45.500 --> 01:13:49.440
<v Speaker 5>That's why didn't they think that the Spaniards on horses were initially gods?</v>

2878
01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:49.801
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2879
01:13:49.801 --> 01:13:51.390
<v Speaker 5>I think they thought they were one being too,</v>

2880
01:13:51.720 --> 01:13:52.770
<v Speaker 5>cause they came off and they're like,</v>

2881
01:13:52.771 --> 01:13:54.030
<v Speaker 5>that thing has got four legs.</v>

2882
01:13:54.090 --> 01:13:54.241
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2883
01:13:54.241 --> 01:13:54.960
<v Speaker 5>I think there was,</v>

2884
01:13:54.960 --> 01:13:56.520
<v Speaker 5>there was a lot of,</v>

2885
01:13:56.521 --> 01:14:00.270
<v Speaker 5>a lot of confusion in the beginning and they actually gave them a lot of money</v>

2886
01:14:00.271 --> 01:14:03.840
<v Speaker 5>and like let them deep in and then they eventually realized,</v>

2887
01:14:03.870 --> 01:14:04.800
<v Speaker 5>but if it was too late,</v>

2888
01:14:04.810 --> 01:14:05.611
<v Speaker 5>the demonic gods,</v>

2889
01:14:05.611 --> 01:14:07.530
<v Speaker 5>they were just men that rode around and fucking horses.</v>

2890
01:14:07.860 --> 01:14:08.820
<v Speaker 5>Unbelievable man.</v>

2920
01:14:44.130 --> 01:14:47.740
<v Speaker 5>Mercenaries came to Hawaii in the 18 hundreds and converted them into</v>

01:14:56.240 --> 01:14:57.640
<v Speaker 5>Hawaii's a crazy situation,</v>

2932
01:14:57.641 --> 01:14:57.910
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

2933
01:14:57.910 --> 01:14:59.680
<v Speaker 5>Did you swim with dolphins when you're there last?</v>

2934
01:14:59.890 --> 01:15:00.400
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2935
01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:01.390
<v Speaker 5>there was no dolphins.</v>

2936
01:15:01.420 --> 01:15:02.590
<v Speaker 5>I didn't see any dolphins,</v>

2937
01:15:03.430 --> 01:15:05.860
<v Speaker 5>but I did it a few times ago.</v>

2938
01:15:06.020 --> 01:15:06.311
<v Speaker 5>Not,</v>

2939
01:15:06.311 --> 01:15:06.911
<v Speaker 5>not this time,</v>

2941
01:15:08.860 --> 01:15:10.810
<v Speaker 5>So another one of the islands and they're there.</v>

2942
01:15:10.811 --> 01:15:11.980
<v Speaker 5>You can swim with the dolphins.</v>

2943
01:15:12.670 --> 01:15:13.000
<v Speaker 5>The,</v>

2944
01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:13.720
<v Speaker 5>the most,</v>

2945
01:15:13.720 --> 01:15:16.060
<v Speaker 5>the triplets experience that I ever had was in a boat with the dolphins.</v>

2946
01:15:16.061 --> 01:15:18.880
<v Speaker 5>Dolphins will follow the boats and the play with you and jump around next to</v>

2947
01:15:18.881 --> 01:15:19.150
<v Speaker 5>you.</v>

2948
01:15:19.150 --> 01:15:19.750
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2949
01:15:19.750 --> 01:15:23.560
<v Speaker 5>It's amazing that that's five hours away by plane,</v>

2950
01:15:23.860 --> 01:15:24.850
<v Speaker 5>yet it's America.</v>

2951
01:15:25.030 --> 01:15:25.860
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2952
01:15:25.860 --> 01:15:26.041
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2953
01:15:26.041 --> 01:15:28.120
<v Speaker 5>And if we can't wrap our head around how big that is,</v>

2954
01:15:28.330 --> 01:15:29.440
<v Speaker 5>that's literally,</v>

2955
01:15:29.470 --> 01:15:34.470
<v Speaker 5>if you took off from Burbank and the whole country was the ocean,</v>

2956
01:15:35.350 --> 01:15:36.250
<v Speaker 5>the whole country,</v>

2957
01:15:36.280 --> 01:15:37.930
<v Speaker 5>every state along the way.</v>

2958
01:15:37.970 --> 01:15:39.220
<v Speaker 5>You look at Ohio,</v>

2959
01:15:39.370 --> 01:15:40.360
<v Speaker 5>it's all ocean.</v>

2960
01:15:40.480 --> 01:15:42.280
<v Speaker 5>And then you land in New Jersey and as the shore,</v>

2961
01:15:42.340 --> 01:15:44.550
<v Speaker 5>that's how fucking far away Hawaii,</v>

2962
01:15:44.570 --> 01:15:48.250
<v Speaker 5>Hawaii is over the ocean and yet it's still considered America.</v>

2963
01:15:50.710 --> 01:15:51.480
<v Speaker 5>That really is,</v>

2964
01:15:51.480 --> 01:15:52.001
<v Speaker 5>you forget that.</v>

2965
01:15:52.001 --> 01:15:52.970
<v Speaker 5>That's colonization,</v>

2966
01:15:52.990 --> 01:15:53.201
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2967
01:15:53.201 --> 01:15:53.860
<v Speaker 5>That's what that is.</v>

2968
01:15:53.860 --> 01:15:55.760
<v Speaker 5>That's gangster shit is what that is.</v>

2969
01:15:56.920 --> 01:15:58.240
<v Speaker 5>Old School gangster shit.</v>

2970
01:15:58.460 --> 01:16:02.350
<v Speaker 5>He'll Hawaii was taken over and the 1890s by businessmen.</v>

2971
01:16:02.710 --> 01:16:03.340
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2972
01:16:03.340 --> 01:16:04.960
<v Speaker 5>At least that's what it said when I was reading there.</v>

2973
01:16:05.260 --> 01:16:05.860
<v Speaker 5>That thing,</v>

2974
01:16:05.860 --> 01:16:09.160
<v Speaker 5>there just were some fucking people trying to keep on keeping on out there in</v>

2975
01:16:09.161 --> 01:16:10.990
<v Speaker 5>the middle of the ocean,</v>

2976
01:16:11.050 --> 01:16:12.280
<v Speaker 5>living on a volcano.</v>

2977
01:16:12.610 --> 01:16:14.410
<v Speaker 5>You know Spain,</v>

2978
01:16:14.450 --> 01:16:17.750
<v Speaker 5>Spain's still has the Canary Islands that's off the west coast to Africa and</v>

2979
01:16:17.751 --> 01:16:17.951
<v Speaker 5>they're like,</v>

2980
01:16:17.951 --> 01:16:18.570
<v Speaker 5>that's how I should,</v>

2981
01:16:18.570 --> 01:16:22.480
<v Speaker 5>we're lucky that Hawaii is five hours away in a plane because that is the best</v>

2982
01:16:22.481 --> 01:16:23.650
<v Speaker 5>spot ever.</v>

2983
01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:24.640
<v Speaker 5>If that,</v>

2984
01:16:24.640 --> 01:16:28.000
<v Speaker 5>if that was like you could drive there and people would ruin that in a week</v>

2985
01:16:28.350 --> 01:16:29.420
<v Speaker 5>cause you could drive it to Hawaii.</v>

2986
01:16:29.460 --> 01:16:30.580
<v Speaker 5>They made a bridge to Hawaii.</v>

2987
01:16:30.700 --> 01:16:35.700
<v Speaker 5>It would be backed up with cars every day forever and Hawaii be covered in dirt</v>

2988
01:16:35.711 --> 01:16:36.100
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

2989
01:16:36.100 --> 01:16:36.490
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

2990
01:16:36.490 --> 01:16:39.160
<v Speaker 5>and fucking plastic bags and cigarette butts.</v>

2991
01:16:39.430 --> 01:16:41.170
<v Speaker 5>It'd be jacked within no time.</v>

2992
01:16:41.410 --> 01:16:41.621
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2993
01:16:41.621 --> 01:16:42.640
<v Speaker 5>It's so beautiful.</v>

2994
01:16:42.670 --> 01:16:42.941
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2995
01:16:42.941 --> 01:16:45.040
<v Speaker 5>It's a fact that you have to fly over there.</v>

2996
01:16:45.041 --> 01:16:46.990
<v Speaker 5>She can't bring too much shit with you.</v>

2997
01:16:46.991 --> 01:16:49.300
<v Speaker 5>You can't keep your shit there unless you live there.</v>

2998
01:16:49.301 --> 01:16:49.961
<v Speaker 5>And if you live there,</v>

2999
01:16:49.961 --> 01:16:52.780
<v Speaker 5>they give you a shit if you're a fucking litter bug Yukon living on,</v>

3000
01:16:52.781 --> 01:16:53.260
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

3001
01:16:53.260 --> 01:16:54.580
<v Speaker 5>like you walk along the beach,</v>

3002
01:16:55.270 --> 01:16:56.620
<v Speaker 5>the beaches are clean man there,</v>

3003
01:16:56.621 --> 01:16:58.810
<v Speaker 5>there've actually fucking clean like the sea,</v>

3004
01:16:58.811 --> 01:17:00.370
<v Speaker 5>very little trash on the beach.</v>

3005
01:17:00.580 --> 01:17:02.470
<v Speaker 5>And if that was the same beach and the east coast,</v>

3006
01:17:02.680 --> 01:17:03.970
<v Speaker 5>it would just be everywhere you looked.</v>

3007
01:17:03.971 --> 01:17:08.810
<v Speaker 5>It'd be a can or a bottle or a fucking a tampon or a syringe.</v>

3008
01:17:09.060 --> 01:17:10.070
<v Speaker 5>Like every where you go this</v>

3009
01:17:10.070 --> 01:17:10.903
<v Speaker 4>trash,</v>

3010
01:17:11.060 --> 01:17:12.440
<v Speaker 4>they can't clean it up enough.</v>

3011
01:17:12.620 --> 01:17:14.870
<v Speaker 4>And then it's in the water as well because you know,</v>

3012
01:17:14.871 --> 01:17:17.780
<v Speaker 4>the water's coming from all the way the fuck up to Maine and everything along</v>

3013

3014
01:17:18.501 --> 01:17:19.940
<v Speaker 4>All down the east coast.</v>

3015
01:17:19.941 --> 01:17:23.060

<v Speaker 4>Half of them are disgusting and comparison.</v>

3025
01:17:32.010 --> 01:17:33.980

<v Speaker 4>Beautiful.</v>

01:17:35.060 --> 01:17:36.290
<v Speaker 4>Couldn't deal with living there though.</v>

3028
01:17:36.470 --> 01:17:36.800
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

3029
01:17:36.800 --> 01:17:37.011
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3030
01:17:37.011 --> 01:17:37.551
<v Speaker 4>I was thinking there.</v>

3031
01:17:37.551 --> 01:17:38.450
<v Speaker 4>I went to a Luau.</v>

3032
01:17:38.630 --> 01:17:40.520
<v Speaker 4>It's pretty bad ass covering up more interesting.</v>

3033
01:17:40.521 --> 01:17:40.731
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

3036
01:17:42.680 --> 01:17:42.891
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3037
01:17:42.891 --> 01:17:43.581
<v Speaker 4>It's like a party.</v>

3038
01:17:43.581 --> 01:17:45.110
<v Speaker 4>They cook a pig under the ground.</v>

3039
01:17:45.111 --> 01:17:46.220
<v Speaker 4>The pig was delicious.</v>

3040
01:17:46.610 --> 01:17:47.181
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

3041
01:17:47.181 --> 01:17:50.350
<v Speaker 4>the dude who was one of the Hawaiian dance or dudes was a,</v>

3042
01:17:50.360 --> 01:17:51.080
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

01:17:52.290 --> 01:17:55.880
<v Speaker 4>He's hooked me up and he gave me a piece of the cheek that's supposed to be the</v>

3046
01:17:55.881 --> 01:17:57.050
<v Speaker 4>best part of the pig.</v>

3047
01:17:57.080 --> 01:17:58.370
<v Speaker 4>The butt cheek or the face cheek.</v>

3048
01:17:58.371 --> 01:17:59.090
<v Speaker 4>The face cheek.</v>

3049
01:17:59.090 --> 01:18:00.080
<v Speaker 4>Not the butt cheek doing,</v>

3050
01:18:00.081 --> 01:18:00.800
<v Speaker 4>how dare you.</v>

3051
01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:00.931
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3052
01:18:00.931 --> 01:18:01.850
<v Speaker 4>you do eat the skin.</v>

3053
01:18:01.851 --> 01:18:02.980
<v Speaker 4>They give you a crispy skin.</v>

3054
01:18:03.040 --> 01:18:03.873
<v Speaker 4>They cook the scans.</v>

3055
01:18:04.090 --> 01:18:05.030
<v Speaker 4>It's really good.</v>

3056
01:18:05.060 --> 01:18:05.893
<v Speaker 4>It's good.</v>

3057
01:18:06.080 --> 01:18:06.913
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3058
01:18:06.980 --> 01:18:07.221
<v Speaker 4>Slow,</v>

3059
01:18:07.221 --> 01:18:07.821
<v Speaker 4>slow cook,</v>

3060
01:18:07.821 --> 01:18:08.630
<v Speaker 4>pig,</v>

3061
01:18:08.630 --> 01:18:09.441
<v Speaker 4>slow cook pig.</v>

3062
01:18:09.441 --> 01:18:10.730
<v Speaker 4>It's pretty fucking spectacular.</v>

3063
01:18:11.300 --> 01:18:11.671
<v Speaker 4>It's a,</v>

3064
01:18:11.671 --> 01:18:12.680
<v Speaker 4>it's amazing stuff.</v>

3065
01:18:12.710 --> 01:18:13.370
<v Speaker 4>Hmm.</v>

3066
01:18:13.370 --> 01:18:13.890
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3067
01:18:13.890 --> 01:18:14.300
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3068
01:18:14.300 --> 01:18:16.850
<v Speaker 4>but their music is whack.</v>

3069
01:18:17.090 --> 01:18:18.410
<v Speaker 4>You have to sit through their music,</v>

3070
01:18:18.860 --> 01:18:19.251
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3071
01:18:19.251 --> 01:18:19.570
<v Speaker 4>and all,</v>

3072
01:18:19.570 --> 01:18:19.890
<v Speaker 4>all,</v>

3073
01:18:19.890 --> 01:18:20.890
<v Speaker 4>all I was thinking was,</v>

3074
01:18:20.891 --> 01:18:23.010
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's a beautiful culture there.</v>

3075
01:18:23.250 --> 01:18:24.530
<v Speaker 4>They're amazing people.</v>

3076
01:18:25.190 --> 01:18:25.701
<v Speaker 4>Especially,</v>

3077
01:18:25.701 --> 01:18:26.201
<v Speaker 4>let's be honest,</v>

3078
01:18:26.201 --> 01:18:29.060
<v Speaker 4>especially when you're going to a resort and you're spending money where they</v>

3079
01:18:29.061 --> 01:18:29.960
<v Speaker 4>have to be nice to you.</v>

3080
01:18:30.050 --> 01:18:30.883
<v Speaker 4>You know what I'm saying?</v>

3081
01:18:30.980 --> 01:18:32.240
<v Speaker 4>But even outside of that,</v>

3082
01:18:32.241 --> 01:18:33.074
<v Speaker 4>like in Maui,</v>

3083
01:18:33.320 --> 01:18:34.310
<v Speaker 4>people are very nice.</v>

3084
01:18:34.310 --> 01:18:35.091
<v Speaker 4>They're just friendly.</v>

3085
01:18:35.091 --> 01:18:35.590
<v Speaker 4>If you're not,</v>

3086
01:18:35.590 --> 01:18:35.900
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

3087
01:18:35.900 --> 01:18:37.610
<v Speaker 4>whenever I hear people say things like,</v>

3088
01:18:37.640 --> 01:18:38.460
<v Speaker 4>Oh Hawaii,</v>

3089
01:18:38.460 --> 01:18:39.710
<v Speaker 4>I just don't like white people.</v>

3090
01:18:39.711 --> 01:18:40.300
<v Speaker 4>They don't like people.</v>

3091
01:18:40.300 --> 01:18:40.460
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3092
01:18:40.460 --> 01:18:41.360
<v Speaker 4>why not?</v>

3093
01:18:42.500 --> 01:18:44.020
<v Speaker 4>Is it because so many white people are cunts?</v>

3094
01:18:44.120 --> 01:18:44.570
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3095
01:18:44.570 --> 01:18:45.860
<v Speaker 4>Is that possibly what it is?</v>

3096
01:18:46.580 --> 01:18:49.100
<v Speaker 4>My experience there is that they've always been super nice there.</v>

3097
01:18:49.110 --> 01:18:50.720
<v Speaker 4>They're just really genuinely nice people.</v>

3098
01:18:50.721 --> 01:18:53.540
<v Speaker 4>But so many people are Douche bags and you're a Douche bag.</v>

3099
01:18:53.541 --> 01:18:57.290
<v Speaker 4>You coming from another country basically to them and you're littering and</v>

3100
01:18:57.291 --> 01:18:58.480
<v Speaker 4>you're acting like an asshole.</v>

3101
01:18:58.490 --> 01:18:59.930
<v Speaker 4>And of course they're going to want to kick your ass.</v>

3102
01:18:59.931 --> 01:19:00.350
<v Speaker 4>Of course.</v>

3103
01:19:00.350 --> 01:19:00.591
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

3104
01:19:00.591 --> 01:19:02.510
<v Speaker 4>So there's this certain amount of Douche bags,</v>

3105
01:19:02.511 --> 01:19:03.680
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure that live in Hawaii,</v>

3106
01:19:03.860 --> 01:19:05.240
<v Speaker 4>but for the most part it's,</v>

3107
01:19:05.450 --> 01:19:06.500
<v Speaker 4>it's a really nice,</v>

3108
01:19:06.890 --> 01:19:09.110
<v Speaker 4>but that music bro,</v>

3109
01:19:09.200 --> 01:19:10.540
<v Speaker 4>that Lou AllMusic goal,</v>

3110
01:19:10.880 --> 01:19:15.880
<v Speaker 4>there was a song that they sang about a woman selling papayas and a red and</v>

3111
01:19:17.871 --> 01:19:22.871
<v Speaker 4>green bananas and that was the whole fucking song she's sending her Papaya has</v>

3112
01:19:25.520 --> 01:19:27.990
<v Speaker 4>and then green when uh,</v>

3113
01:19:28.460 --> 01:19:29.570
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3114
01:19:29.750 --> 01:19:32.480
<v Speaker 4>and that's the song and I'm going fucking crazy.</v>

3115
01:19:32.720 --> 01:19:35.030
<v Speaker 4>I'm going crazy because I just got there from the gym too.</v>

3116
01:19:35.031 --> 01:19:35.541
<v Speaker 4>I worked out,</v>

3117
01:19:35.541 --> 01:19:36.770
<v Speaker 4>they have a nice gym there at the hotel,</v>

3118
01:19:37.040 --> 01:19:41.210
<v Speaker 4>so I kinda know full fucking four days of power training their son.</v>

3119
01:19:41.240 --> 01:19:43.430
<v Speaker 4>I worked out hard there so it felt good,</v>

3120
01:19:44.030 --> 01:19:45.110
<v Speaker 4>which kept me together.</v>

3121
01:19:45.200 --> 01:19:46.310
<v Speaker 4>But the whole time I was a,</v>

3122
01:19:46.311 --> 01:19:46.791
<v Speaker 4>in the gym,</v>

3123
01:19:46.791 --> 01:19:48.050
<v Speaker 4>I was listening to some old school,</v>

3124
01:19:48.051 --> 01:19:48.884
<v Speaker 4>Leonard Skinner,</v>

3125
01:19:48.950 --> 01:19:50.870
<v Speaker 4>I got like really into Leonard Skinner this week.</v>

3126
01:19:50.980 --> 01:19:51.740

3128
01:19:54.110 --> 01:19:55.040
<v Speaker 4>Oh God.</v>

3129
01:19:55.041 --> 01:19:55.610
<v Speaker 4>It was just,</v>

3130
01:19:55.610 --> 01:19:59.690
<v Speaker 4>I just got into the whole idea of these dirty white guys from Florida,</v>

3131
01:19:59.840 --> 01:20:00.141
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3132
01:20:00.141 --> 01:20:02.090
<v Speaker 4>drinking and sing in and it's just,</v>

3133
01:20:02.240 --> 01:20:03.660
<v Speaker 4>it's a fucking good vibe.</v>

3134
01:20:03.661 --> 01:20:05.870
<v Speaker 4>Some of their songs are fucking great man,</v>

3135
01:20:06.110 --> 01:20:07.770
<v Speaker 4>free birds kind of a song</v>

3136
01:20:08.010 --> 01:20:09.540
<v Speaker 1>and there's parts that are not that fun,</v>

3137
01:20:09.750 --> 01:20:13.650
<v Speaker 1>but when they go and they just start getting low that I can't change</v>

3138
01:20:17.670 --> 01:20:18.680

<v Speaker 6>I'm not telling you my material.</v>

3478
01:27:20.330 --> 01:27:20.730
<v Speaker 6>This is what I,</v>

3479
01:27:20.730 --> 01:27:21.501
<v Speaker 6>that's gross.</v>

3480
01:27:21.501 --> 01:27:21.720
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3481
01:27:21.720 --> 01:27:22.553
<v Speaker 6>it is gross.</v>

3482
01:27:22.640 --> 01:27:22.911
<v Speaker 6>You won't,</v>

3483
01:27:22.911 --> 01:27:23.330
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3484
01:27:23.330 --> 01:27:25.090
<v Speaker 6>if you ever want to come to a show and,</v>

3485
01:27:25.250 --> 01:27:26.910
<v Speaker 6>well the thing is too like kind of I,</v>

3486
01:27:27.020 --> 01:27:27.890
<v Speaker 6>he kept going to like,</v>

3487
01:27:27.980 --> 01:27:28.311
<v Speaker 6>so what are you,</v>

3488
01:27:28.311 --> 01:27:28.551
<v Speaker 6>come on,</v>

3489
01:27:28.551 --> 01:27:29.390
<v Speaker 6>tell me what you're talking about.</v>

3490
01:27:29.630 --> 01:27:31.550
<v Speaker 6>This is really what it comes down to to like,</v>

3491
01:27:31.551 --> 01:27:33.620
<v Speaker 6>it's like all you have to do,</v>

3492
01:27:33.650 --> 01:27:34.470
<v Speaker 6>if you have a comment,</v>

3493
01:27:34.470 --> 01:27:37.730
<v Speaker 6>if you're a radio station or whatever it a Dj is,</v>

3494
01:27:37.731 --> 01:27:40.190
<v Speaker 6>just have the minimum amount,</v>

3495
01:27:40.570 --> 01:27:43.310
<v Speaker 6>like feign interest in who's in front of you,</v>

3496
01:27:43.900 --> 01:27:47.780
<v Speaker 6>like just a little bit and you can get a conversation going that there's going</v>

3497
01:27:47.781 --> 01:27:49.340
<v Speaker 6>to be interesting and funny.</v>

3498
01:27:49.520 --> 01:27:51.320
<v Speaker 6>And like usually if it's somebody famous,</v>

3499
01:27:51.321 --> 01:27:51.741
<v Speaker 6>like if you,</v>

3500
01:27:51.741 --> 01:27:52.280
<v Speaker 6>they go,</v>

3501
01:27:52.280 --> 01:27:53.360
<v Speaker 6>it's already in their head.</v>

3502
01:27:53.510 --> 01:27:54.200
<v Speaker 6>So they'll be like,</v>

3503
01:27:54.200 --> 01:27:56.290
<v Speaker 6>I love news radio or you sweat though.</v>

3504
01:27:56.300 --> 01:27:57.140
<v Speaker 6>So they'll ask you like,</v>

3505
01:27:57.141 --> 01:27:57.561
<v Speaker 6>what about this?</v>

3506
01:27:57.561 --> 01:27:58.940
<v Speaker 6>And they can get something going.</v>

3507
01:27:59.240 --> 01:28:00.770
<v Speaker 6>But if they don't know who you are,</v>

3508
01:28:00.771 --> 01:28:01.670
<v Speaker 6>they don't recognize you.</v>

3509
01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:03.020
<v Speaker 6>They sometimes,</v>

3510
01:28:03.021 --> 01:28:03.350
<v Speaker 6>some,</v>

3511
01:28:03.350 --> 01:28:03.921
<v Speaker 6>not all of them,</v>

3512
01:28:03.921 --> 01:28:05.300
<v Speaker 6>but some of them will literally just be like,</v>

3513
01:28:05.990 --> 01:28:06.830
<v Speaker 6>so what's up?</v>

3514
01:28:07.040 --> 01:28:07.401
<v Speaker 6>And like,</v>

3515
01:28:07.401 --> 01:28:08.270
<v Speaker 6>you're on the air and you're like,</v>

3516
01:28:08.890 --> 01:28:09.080
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3517
01:28:09.080 --> 01:28:10.460
<v Speaker 6>flew in what?</v>

3518
01:28:11.420 --> 01:28:12.253
<v Speaker 6>I'm tired.</v>

3519
01:28:12.290 --> 01:28:13.123
<v Speaker 6>And they're like,</v>

3520
01:28:13.220 --> 01:28:13.731
<v Speaker 6>do you have any?</v>

3521
01:28:13.731 --> 01:28:14.900
<v Speaker 6>Like you want to get into your shit and you're like,</v>

3522
01:28:15.330 --> 01:28:16.730
<v Speaker 6>just really like,</v>

3523
01:28:17.210 --> 01:28:18.680
<v Speaker 6>I'm just going to fucking dance around right now.</v>

3524
01:28:18.710 --> 01:28:20.870
<v Speaker 6>Maybe it's people that just don't understand stand up,</v>

3525
01:28:20.930 --> 01:28:21.381
<v Speaker 6>I guess.</v>

3526
01:28:21.381 --> 01:28:22.214
<v Speaker 6>You know?</v>

3527
01:28:22.630 --> 01:28:23.120
<v Speaker 6>I just,</v>

3528
01:28:23.120 --> 01:28:26.330
<v Speaker 6>it always makes it like this is like weird and then you leave it.</v>

3529
01:28:26.331 --> 01:28:26.990
<v Speaker 6>Like that was fun.</v>

3530
01:28:26.990 --> 01:28:28.850
<v Speaker 6>That wasn't a promotion for the show.</v>

3531
01:28:28.860 --> 01:28:30.080
<v Speaker 6>That was just awkwardness.</v>

3532
01:28:30.081 --> 01:28:30.471
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3533
01:28:30.471 --> 01:28:34.340
<v Speaker 6>That was really awkward and painful and I don't want anything to do with that.</v>

3534
01:28:34.341 --> 01:28:34.580
<v Speaker 6>Again,</v>

3535
01:28:34.580 --> 01:28:37.490
<v Speaker 6>I don't think a lot of those guys that are doing radio want to be doing it that</v>

3536
01:28:37.491 --> 01:28:38.150
<v Speaker 6>way either.</v>

3537
01:28:38.150 --> 01:28:40.850
<v Speaker 6>It was a lot of them that are stuck with a real format.</v>

3538
01:28:40.851 --> 01:28:41.684
<v Speaker 6>They have to follow up.</v>

3539
01:28:41.920 --> 01:28:42.420
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3540
01:28:42.420 --> 01:28:43.370
<v Speaker 6>That's a bitch dude.</v>

3541
01:28:44.030 --> 01:28:45.890
<v Speaker 6>When you're hanging around with people and you know their shit,</v>

3542
01:28:45.891 --> 01:28:49.040
<v Speaker 6>they can't talk about any more breaks they have to hit and you know.</v>

3543
01:28:49.070 --> 01:28:49.440
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3544
01:28:49.440 --> 01:28:51.470
<v Speaker 6>But that just sounds like people just suck at radio.</v>

3545
01:28:51.540 --> 01:28:52.130
<v Speaker 6>They do.</v>

3546
01:28:52.130 --> 01:28:52.400
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3547
01:28:52.400 --> 01:28:53.233
<v Speaker 6>Some of them do.</v>

3548
01:28:53.250 --> 01:28:53.620
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

3549
01:28:53.620 --> 01:28:55.150
<v Speaker 6>some of them just don't like,</v>

3550
01:28:56.030 --> 01:28:58.550
<v Speaker 6>I think he would just look up one thing on somebody can be like,</v>

3551
01:28:58.580 --> 01:28:59.413
<v Speaker 6>what's up with this dude?</v>

3552
01:28:59.630 --> 01:29:00.770
<v Speaker 6>Well I think a lot of people,</v>

3553
01:29:00.790 --> 01:29:01.400
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

3554
01:29:01.400 --> 01:29:02.280
<v Speaker 6>are not that interesting.</v>

3555
01:29:02.640 --> 01:29:02.911
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3556
01:29:02.911 --> 01:29:03.930
<v Speaker 1>And that's the reality of it.</v>

3557
01:29:03.960 --> 01:29:05.430
<v Speaker 1>They shouldn't really be Djs,</v>

3558
01:29:05.431 --> 01:29:08.580
<v Speaker 1>but they've worked hard at it and they've pushed themselves into a situation</v>

3559
01:29:08.581 --> 01:29:09.300
<v Speaker 1>where there,</v>

3560
01:29:09.300 --> 01:29:09.541
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3561
01:29:09.541 --> 01:29:11.970
<v Speaker 1>on TV all the or on the radio rather all the time.</v>

3562
01:29:11.971 --> 01:29:14.370
<v Speaker 1>We actually have a little bit of a following and then they get a little bit of</v>

3563
01:29:14.371 --> 01:29:16.680
<v Speaker 1>an ego behind it and they think they're special.</v>

3564
01:29:16.710 --> 01:29:17.543
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3565
01:29:18.510 --> 01:29:22.200
<v Speaker 1>I would like to buy a book of just like a thousand people doing their stinkeye</v>

3566
01:29:22.350 --> 01:29:25.260
<v Speaker 1>like different versions of their stinkeye cause everyone is a little bit</v>

3567
01:29:25.261 --> 01:29:25.621
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>

3568
01:29:25.621 --> 01:29:27.060
<v Speaker 1>It would have to be a legit stinkeye though.</v>

3569
01:29:28.050 --> 01:29:28.883
<v Speaker 1>Let me see your state guy.</v>

3570
01:29:29.010 --> 01:29:29.401
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

3571
01:29:29.401 --> 01:29:30.840
<v Speaker 1>You'd have to say something stupid again.</v>

3572
01:29:31.140 --> 01:29:31.973
<v Speaker 1>I'll give it to you.</v>

3573
01:29:32.490 --> 01:29:33.061
<v Speaker 1>How about that?</v>

3574
01:29:33.061 --> 01:29:33.894
<v Speaker 1>Ready?</v>

3575
01:29:34.140 --> 01:29:36.450
<v Speaker 1>I shaved my boss the other day and I have a mole on,</v>

3576
01:29:36.451 --> 01:29:37.950
<v Speaker 1>I forgot about it and I cut it off.</v>

3577
01:29:37.950 --> 01:29:38.783
<v Speaker 1>Is that okay?</v>

3578
01:29:39.690 --> 01:29:39.901
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3579
01:29:39.901 --> 01:29:40.141
<v Speaker 1>you should.</v>

3580
01:29:40.141 --> 01:29:41.370
<v Speaker 1>Probably you'd be okay.</v>

3581
01:29:41.430 --> 01:29:41.910
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3582
01:29:41.910 --> 01:29:43.340
<v Speaker 1>Melissa can be cut off right,</v>

3583
01:29:43.341 --> 01:29:43.591
<v Speaker 1>but your,</v>

3584
01:29:43.591 --> 01:29:47.010
<v Speaker 1>your balls are probably like a fucking water balloon and that's going to be a</v>

3585
01:29:47.011 --> 01:29:47.341
<v Speaker 1>whole,</v>

3694
01:31:53.760 --> 01:31:54.320
<v Speaker 1>Three times.</v>

3695
01:31:54.320 --> 01:31:56.220
<v Speaker 1>If you've ever been to any of the mine sites,</v>

3696
01:31:56.221 --> 01:31:58.290
<v Speaker 1>like teaching Eatsa or no pullover.</v>

3697
01:31:58.650 --> 01:31:59.710
<v Speaker 1>I've only been at Chichen Eatsa,</v>

3698
01:31:59.730 --> 01:31:59.980
<v Speaker 1>but that</v>

3699
01:31:59.980 --> 01:32:00.191
<v Speaker 4>was,</v>

3700
01:32:00.191 --> 01:32:00.850
<v Speaker 4>I was enough.</v>

3701
01:32:00.850 --> 01:32:02.200
<v Speaker 4>That was enough to freak me the fuck out.</v>

3702
01:32:02.220 --> 01:32:02.501
<v Speaker 4>I did.</v>

3703
01:32:02.501 --> 01:32:02.770
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3704
01:32:02.770 --> 01:32:04.210
<v Speaker 4>What did you think when you first saw that?</v>

3705
01:32:04.300 --> 01:32:04.511
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3706
01:32:04.511 --> 01:32:07.270
<v Speaker 4>I've been a huge fan of uh,</v>

3707
01:32:07.300 --> 01:32:07.661
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3708
01:32:07.661 --> 01:32:08.110
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3709
01:32:08.110 --> 01:32:11.740
<v Speaker 4>the Mayan culture and how bizarre they were and how their writing was in this</v>

3710
01:32:11.741 --> 01:32:14.830
<v Speaker 4>weird sort of hieroglyphs images that represented,</v>

3711
01:32:15.490 --> 01:32:15.880
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3712
01:32:15.880 --> 01:32:16.030
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3713
01:32:16.030 --> 01:32:16.780
<v Speaker 4>so I had,</v>

3714
01:32:16.780 --> 01:32:18.250
<v Speaker 4>I'd really gotten into it.</v>

3715
01:32:18.251 --> 01:32:20.590
<v Speaker 4>I read a lot of books about it before I ever went down there.</v>

3716
01:32:20.860 --> 01:32:22.570
<v Speaker 4>And then once I went down there I was like,</v>

3717
01:32:22.571 --> 01:32:24.010
<v Speaker 4>this is so incredible.</v>

3718
01:32:24.790 --> 01:32:25.061
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3719
01:32:25.061 --> 01:32:25.211
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

3720
01:32:25.211 --> 01:32:27.610
<v Speaker 4>it's just hard to believe that these people from,</v>

3721
01:32:27.611 --> 01:32:28.060
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3722
01:32:28.060 --> 01:32:31.210
<v Speaker 4>x amount of thousands of years ago created this and then it's still here.</v>

3723
01:32:31.570 --> 01:32:35.440
<v Speaker 4>But the thing that really sealed it for me was I got a guy who is a local</v>

3724
01:32:35.441 --> 01:32:39.360
<v Speaker 4>professor who was one of the guides and you paid him.</v>

3725
01:32:39.620 --> 01:32:41.110
<v Speaker 4>I paid him like whatever it was,</v>

3726
01:32:41.111 --> 01:32:44.140
<v Speaker 4>I gave him like double what he was supposed to make cause he was super cool and</v>

3727
01:32:44.141 --> 01:32:45.430
<v Speaker 4>he takes me on this tour,</v>

3728
01:32:45.431 --> 01:32:50.431
<v Speaker 4>a personal one on one tour and we go to all these different spots and it</v>

3729
01:32:50.680 --> 01:32:54.220
<v Speaker 4>explains what they created this for and what is designed for.</v>

3730
01:32:54.400 --> 01:32:55.660
<v Speaker 4>And he took me to this one spot.</v>

3731
01:32:55.661 --> 01:32:55.961
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

3732
01:32:55.961 --> 01:32:57.610
<v Speaker 4>this is the place where they would do the list,</v>

3733
01:32:57.611 --> 01:33:00.280
<v Speaker 4>ceramic acid that they would take from all these plants.</v>

3734
01:33:00.730 --> 01:33:01.360
<v Speaker 4>And this was like,</v>

3735
01:33:01.360 --> 01:33:04.150
<v Speaker 4>well they would have psychedelic rituals and they probably mushrooms.</v>

3736
01:33:04.190 --> 01:33:07.300
<v Speaker 4>He's telling me about all these different things they did like and that's when</v>

3737
01:33:07.301 --> 01:33:09.790
<v Speaker 4>the whole mind thing had pieced together from me.</v>

3738
01:33:09.791 --> 01:33:11.440
<v Speaker 4>Cause I had just started doing mushrooms.</v>

3739
01:33:11.441 --> 01:33:14.260
<v Speaker 4>I just had like a couple of trips before I'd ever went there.</v>

3740
01:33:14.410 --> 01:33:18.400
<v Speaker 4>So then when I went there and I saw that these people were fucking trippers,</v>

3741
01:33:18.580 --> 01:33:19.000
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

3742
01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:19.920
<v Speaker 4>oh well that,</v>

3743
01:33:19.921 --> 01:33:21.910
<v Speaker 4>that explains so much.</v>

3744
01:33:22.180 --> 01:33:25.360
<v Speaker 4>I was wondering why would anybody build these crazy geometric patterns,</v>

3745
01:33:25.361 --> 01:33:29.650
<v Speaker 4>that mirror of the cosmos and he's incredible elaborate stone structures.</v>

3746
01:33:29.651 --> 01:33:30.484
<v Speaker 4>Like what was going on?</v>

3747
01:33:30.640 --> 01:33:30.821
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

3748
01:33:30.821 --> 01:33:32.000
<v Speaker 4>they were tripping their balls off.</v>

3749
01:33:32.100 --> 01:33:33.220
<v Speaker 4>Do they tell you that too?</v>

3750
01:33:33.221 --> 01:33:33.970
<v Speaker 4>Like he explained it.</v>

3751
01:33:33.970 --> 01:33:34.640
<v Speaker 4>He did.</v>

3752
01:33:34.640 --> 01:33:34.910
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>

3753
01:33:34.910 --> 01:33:35.121
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3754
01:33:35.121 --> 01:33:36.040
<v Speaker 4>the professor did.</v>

3755
01:33:36.041 --> 01:33:36.281
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3756
01:33:36.281 --> 01:33:39.130
<v Speaker 4>he went into depth about it because I told him that something I was really</v>

3757
01:33:39.131 --> 01:33:40.480
<v Speaker 4>interested in and I said,</v>

3758
01:33:40.481 --> 01:33:40.721
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

3759
01:33:40.721 --> 01:33:42.580
<v Speaker 4>I'm always fascinated by the,</v>

3760
01:33:42.581 --> 01:33:43.030
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3761
01:33:43.030 --> 01:33:46.030
<v Speaker 4>the different ways in ancient culture is altered this state of consciousness,</v>

3762
01:33:46.031 --> 01:33:47.380
<v Speaker 4>whether it was alcohol or you know,</v>

3763
01:33:47.381 --> 01:33:48.790
<v Speaker 4>the pod for the Indians or whatever.</v>

3764
01:33:48.970 --> 01:33:53.710
<v Speaker 4>And so he also had a lot of knowledge about that particular area.</v>

3765
01:33:53.711 --> 01:33:57.940
<v Speaker 4>So he talked to me in depth about what they believe happened and where this is</v>

3766
01:33:57.941 --> 01:33:59.140
<v Speaker 4>what they were used for rituals.</v>

3767
01:33:59.141 --> 01:34:00.850
<v Speaker 4>And it's certain the symbols,</v>

3768
01:34:00.890 --> 01:34:01.240
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3769
01:34:01.240 --> 01:34:04.300
<v Speaker 4>indicate that they use certain different psychedelic plants and mushrooms.</v>

3770
01:34:05.410 --> 01:34:07.060
<v Speaker 4>Fucking of course that's what happened.</v>

3771
01:34:07.350 --> 01:34:08.110
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3772
01:34:08.110 --> 01:34:08.470
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3773
01:34:08.470 --> 01:34:09.310
<v Speaker 4>they tripped balls,</v>

3774
01:34:09.640 --> 01:34:13.280
<v Speaker 4>they had some crazy ideas and then it'll get a little out of hand.</v>

3775
01:34:15.370 --> 01:34:16.420
<v Speaker 4>They always get out of hand,</v>

3776
01:34:16.421 --> 01:34:16.910
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

3777
01:34:16.910 --> 01:34:19.060
<v Speaker 4>as basically those South American fucking culture is,</v>

3778
01:34:19.061 --> 01:34:19.960
<v Speaker 4>it's too hot down there,</v>

<v Speaker 4>dude.</v>

3780

01:34:21.610 --> 01:34:22.090
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3782
01:34:22.090 --> 01:34:25.390
<v Speaker 4>start slicing people over a fucking don't drink enough water and next thing you</v>

3783
01:34:25.391 --> 01:34:25.481
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

3784
01:34:25.481 --> 01:34:26.890
<v Speaker 4>you're making a human sacrifice.</v>

3785
01:34:26.920 --> 01:34:27.280
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3786
01:34:27.280 --> 01:34:28.240
<v Speaker 4>That shits crazy.</v>

3787
01:34:28.241 --> 01:34:28.570
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3788
01:34:28.570 --> 01:34:29.770
<v Speaker 4>Human sacrifice.</v>

3789
01:34:29.820 --> 01:34:31.490
<v Speaker 4>He did a lot of it ritually.</v>

3790
01:34:31.500 --> 01:34:31.780
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3791
01:34:31.780 --> 01:34:32.021
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3792
01:34:32.021 --> 01:34:34.990
<v Speaker 4>there's speculation about that game that they played,</v>

3793
01:34:35.170 --> 01:34:35.351
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3794
01:34:35.351 --> 01:34:36.520
<v Speaker 4>that football game,</v>

3795
01:34:36.640 --> 01:34:39.640
<v Speaker 4>which they believed at one point in time they played with human heads.</v>

3796
01:34:39.850 --> 01:34:41.530
<v Speaker 4>They don't necessarily believe that anymore.</v>

3797
01:34:41.770 --> 01:34:44.200
<v Speaker 4>They believe they may have played some games with human heads,</v>

3798
01:34:44.350 --> 01:34:49.060
<v Speaker 4>but they believe that the winners of the game were the ones who got sacrificed.</v>

3799
01:34:49.280 --> 01:34:49.990
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>

3800
01:34:49.990 --> 01:34:50.670
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3801
01:34:50.670 --> 01:34:51.610
<v Speaker 4>So they don't know.</v>

3802
01:34:51.611 --> 01:34:51.791
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3803
01:34:51.791 --> 01:34:55.390
<v Speaker 4>there's some speculation and we tried to lose as much as possible at least.</v>

3804
01:34:55.750 --> 01:34:56.500
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3805
01:34:56.500 --> 01:34:56.780
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

3806
01:34:56.780 --> 01:34:57.160
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3807
01:34:57.160 --> 01:35:00.650
<v Speaker 4>an amazing National Geographic special on decoding Maya.</v>

3808
01:35:00.860 --> 01:35:02.690
<v Speaker 4>I think it's actually called that decoding my,</v>

3809
01:35:02.700 --> 01:35:06.380
<v Speaker 4>about how hard it's been to decode their language and trying to figure out what</v>

3810
01:35:06.381 --> 01:35:07.130
<v Speaker 4>the fuck,</v>

3811
01:35:07.130 --> 01:35:07.371
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3812
01:35:07.371 --> 01:35:08.940
<v Speaker 4>these guys were talking about.</v>

3813
01:35:09.140 --> 01:35:10.190
<v Speaker 4>It's so complex,</v>

3814
01:35:10.820 --> 01:35:11.630
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

3815
01:35:11.630 --> 01:35:13.280
<v Speaker 4>just that alone,</v>

3816
01:35:13.400 --> 01:35:14.233
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3817
01:35:14.730 --> 01:35:16.960
<v Speaker 4>it's all their structures.</v>

3818
01:35:16.990 --> 01:35:18.650
<v Speaker 4>They left behind the,</v>

3819
01:35:18.770 --> 01:35:19.370
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3820
01:35:19.370 --> 01:35:23.570
<v Speaker 4>the amazing sophistication of their culture and yet they are still killing</v>

3821
01:35:23.571 --> 01:35:27.350
<v Speaker 4>people and sacrificing and mother and may be killing the winners.</v>

3822
01:35:27.830 --> 01:35:28.280
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3823
01:35:28.280 --> 01:35:28.641
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3824
01:35:28.641 --> 01:35:31.370
<v Speaker 4>the quiet why it's what were you doing?</v>

3825
01:35:31.400 --> 01:35:32.233
<v Speaker 4>You're the best man.</v>

3826
01:35:32.270 --> 01:35:33.000
<v Speaker 4>What were they doing?</v>

3827
01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:34.700
<v Speaker 4>W but the way that they were just,</v>

3828
01:35:35.170 --> 01:35:39.560
<v Speaker 4>they were just fucking trip and balls hardcore all the time.</v>

3829
01:35:39.561 --> 01:35:42.830
<v Speaker 4>That's why I think it was almost like that is what would happen.</v>

3830
01:35:43.100 --> 01:35:46.520
<v Speaker 4>What would happen to the society if you were just fucking tripping your balls</v>

3831
01:35:46.521 --> 01:35:47.354
<v Speaker 4>out all the time.</v>

3832
01:35:47.390 --> 01:35:50.180
<v Speaker 4>Well you would make these incredible pyramids and you would keep making them</v>

3833
01:35:50.270 --> 01:35:54.440
<v Speaker 4>doper and doper like Cheech and pizza and she needs is amazing man.</v>

3834
01:35:54.620 --> 01:35:55.520
<v Speaker 4>It's just incredible.</v>

3835
01:35:55.521 --> 01:35:59.000
<v Speaker 4>One structure after another and in mind blowing shit and then he would start</v>

3836
01:35:59.001 --> 01:36:01.400
<v Speaker 4>playing football with human heads and you know,</v>

3837
01:36:02.200 --> 01:36:02.750
<v Speaker 4>fucking,</v>

3838
01:36:02.750 --> 01:36:06.020
<v Speaker 4>you would just go deep and you would want to kill people because you would know</v>

3839
01:36:06.021 --> 01:36:07.430
<v Speaker 4>that they would go to the next place,</v>

3840
01:36:07.660 --> 01:36:08.221
<v Speaker 4>the next place.</v>

3841
01:36:08.221 --> 01:36:10.670
<v Speaker 4>It'd be amazing cause you already been there cause you're tripping balls.</v>

3842
01:36:10.880 --> 01:36:12.860
<v Speaker 4>So like you're tripping balls while you're cutting.</v>

3843
01:36:12.861 --> 01:36:16.340
<v Speaker 4>Someone's beating heart out and you're watching them as you're tripping your</v>

3844
01:36:16.341 --> 01:36:16.851
<v Speaker 4>balls off,</v>

3845
01:36:16.851 --> 01:36:19.370
<v Speaker 4>you're watching them transfer into the next dimension.</v>

3846
01:36:19.371 --> 01:36:19.890
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3847

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

01:36:22.160 --> 01:36:23.030
<v Speaker 4>Too much mushrooms.</v>

3850
01:36:23.031 --> 01:36:24.380
<v Speaker 4>That's what keeps you awake at night.</v>

3851
01:36:25.930 --> 01:36:26.763
<v Speaker 4>That's ridiculous.</v>

3855
01:36:30.381 --> 01:36:30.770
<v Speaker 4>these,</v>

3856
01:36:30.770 --> 01:36:32.180

3863
01:36:35.661 --> 01:36:39.560
<v Speaker 4>all these different things that are here that show that there's been all these</v>

3864
01:36:39.561 --> 01:36:40.281
<v Speaker 4>different ancient,</v>

3865
01:36:40.281 --> 01:36:42.410
<v Speaker 4>ancient civilizations that existed for so long.</v>

3866
01:36:42.750 --> 01:36:43.060
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

3867
01:36:43.060 --> 01:36:45.590
<v Speaker 4>I wonder how many of them were inspired by drugs.</v>

3868
01:36:45.890 --> 01:36:48.620
<v Speaker 4>I wonder how many of her were inspired by some dude who picked something up,</v>

3869
01:36:48.621 --> 01:36:48.981
<v Speaker 4>ate it,</v>

3870
01:36:48.981 --> 01:36:50.990
<v Speaker 4>and had his fucking crazy freaky idea.</v>

3871
01:36:51.380 --> 01:36:52.360
<v Speaker 4>Here's what we gotta do.</v>

3872
01:36:52.620 --> 01:36:53.030
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3873
01:36:53.030 --> 01:36:54.740
<v Speaker 4>We're building a city up here in the mountains.</v>

3874
01:36:54.920 --> 01:36:58.730
<v Speaker 4>We probably lost contact with all that shit and things are nice and easy now.</v>

3875
01:36:58.731 --> 01:37:01.460
<v Speaker 4>So we don't need psychedelic drugs to try to figure out the world anymore.</v>

3876
01:37:01.461 --> 01:37:02.450
<v Speaker 4>At least we don't think we do.</v>

3877
01:37:03.290 --> 01:37:04.520
<v Speaker 4>That's probably what the fuck is going on.</v>

3878
01:37:04.730 --> 01:37:06.230
<v Speaker 4>That's probably why this world's falling apart.</v>

3879
01:37:07.340 --> 01:37:08.660
<v Speaker 4>If we could write it somehow,</v>

3880
01:37:09.740 --> 01:37:13.040
<v Speaker 4>that would be the way you saw a massive mushroom day.</v>

3881
01:37:13.220 --> 01:37:16.910
<v Speaker 4>Do you know how much a mushroom day would do for this world?</v>

3882
01:37:17.120 --> 01:37:17.960
<v Speaker 4>A national,</v>

3883
01:37:17.990 --> 01:37:21.290
<v Speaker 4>national mushroom day would change America forever.</v>

3884
01:37:21.350 --> 01:37:22.160
<v Speaker 4>Forever.</v>

3885
01:37:22.160 --> 01:37:23.540
<v Speaker 4>When we just had one day,</v>

3886
01:37:23.780 --> 01:37:28.780
<v Speaker 4>if we had a national mushroom day where they opened up places where people could</v>

3887
01:37:29.001 --> 01:37:33.050
<v Speaker 4>buy mushrooms and they had medical staff waiting 24 hours a day for people who</v>

3888
01:37:33.051 --> 01:37:34.460
<v Speaker 4>are freaking out and you know,</v>

3889
01:37:34.461 --> 01:37:36.230
<v Speaker 4>you signed up and you went into these,</v>

3890
01:37:36.231 --> 01:37:36.800
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3891
01:37:36.800 --> 01:37:40.920
<v Speaker 4>fucking bunk rooms and everyone took it together and everyone was cool.</v>

3892
01:37:41.180 --> 01:37:43.550
<v Speaker 4>They had security around a lot of people that weren't high.</v>

3893
01:37:43.790 --> 01:37:44.870
<v Speaker 4>That's the whole thing you want to know,</v>

3894
01:37:44.871 --> 01:37:45.111
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3895
01:37:45.111 --> 01:37:47.310
<v Speaker 4>It's like you want to be told everything's gonna be all right.</v>

3896
01:37:47.600 --> 01:37:48.210
<v Speaker 4>That'd be cooked.</v>

3897
01:37:48.210 --> 01:37:49.043
<v Speaker 4>Went through my insurance.</v>

3898
01:37:49.070 --> 01:37:51.620
<v Speaker 4>75% of the population probably suck.</v>

3899
01:37:51.700 --> 01:37:53.000
<v Speaker 4>A lot of people would freak out.</v>

3900
01:37:53.090 --> 01:37:54.140
<v Speaker 4>A lot of people would freak out,</v>

3901
01:37:54.141 --> 01:37:55.130
<v Speaker 4>but my man,</v>

3902
01:37:55.140 --> 01:37:56.770
<v Speaker 4>all the people who didn't freak out,</v>

3903
01:37:57.330 --> 01:37:58.350
<v Speaker 4>even if they did freak out,</v>

3904
01:37:58.351 --> 01:38:00.780
<v Speaker 4>they'd probably learn something from it and everybody would come back with a</v>

3905
01:38:00.781 --> 01:38:04.860
<v Speaker 4>reinvigorated sense of who we are and how we interface with each other on this</v>

3906
01:38:04.861 --> 01:38:05.280
<v Speaker 4>planet.</v>

3907
01:38:05.280 --> 01:38:06.480
<v Speaker 4>How many thought about that?</v>

3908
01:38:06.481 --> 01:38:07.261
<v Speaker 4>How many times have you done it?</v>

3909
01:38:07.261 --> 01:38:08.094
<v Speaker 4>He's done a lot.</v>

3910
01:38:08.480 --> 01:38:10.290
<v Speaker 4>Tion seven times.</v>

3911
01:38:10.410 --> 01:38:11.040
<v Speaker 4>Mushrooms.</v>

3912
01:38:11.040 --> 01:38:11.520
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3913
01:38:11.520 --> 01:38:14.220
<v Speaker 4>And bump been DMT and mushrooms both about the same times</v>

3914
01:38:14.510 --> 01:38:15.151
<v Speaker 1>you have it.</v>

3915
01:38:15.151 --> 01:38:15.984
<v Speaker 1>You have a lot.</v>

3916
01:38:16.400 --> 01:38:17.810
<v Speaker 1>Hundreds,</v>

3917
01:38:17.810 --> 01:38:17.840
<v Speaker 1>hundreds.</v>

3918
01:38:17.840 --> 01:38:21.820
<v Speaker 1>I mean I've been doing it since I was 15 so he's worse poster boy ever from</v>

3919
01:38:21.821 --> 01:38:22.281
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms.</v>

3920
01:38:22.281 --> 01:38:22.880
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3921
01:38:22.880 --> 01:38:23.780
<v Speaker 1>This motherfucker,</v>

3922
01:38:23.840 --> 01:38:24.920
<v Speaker 1>he's just like the Mayans.</v>

3923
01:38:25.670 --> 01:38:27.620
<v Speaker 1>Do you worship Poom serpents now?</v>

3924
01:38:27.680 --> 01:38:28.280
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

3925
01:38:28.280 --> 01:38:28.981
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy man.</v>

3926
01:38:28.981 --> 01:38:29.690
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot.</v>

3927
01:38:29.690 --> 01:38:30.430
<v Speaker 1>I've never done it.</v>

3928
01:38:30.430 --> 01:38:31.700
<v Speaker 1>Well I used to do acid a lot,</v>

3929
01:38:31.701 --> 01:38:32.660
<v Speaker 1>but then I started doing,</v>

3930
01:38:32.750 --> 01:38:34.660
<v Speaker 1>I switched just in my Sherman slam when I was like,</v>

3931
01:38:35.140 --> 01:38:36.760
<v Speaker 4>it's like I was doing them all bros,</v>

3932
01:38:36.790 --> 01:38:37.990
<v Speaker 4>but I went to Marlboro Lights.</v>

3933
01:38:37.991 --> 01:38:38.410
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3934
01:38:38.410 --> 01:38:39.940
<v Speaker 4>I switched to just mushrooms,</v>

3935
01:38:39.941 --> 01:38:40.774
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

3936
01:38:40.810 --> 01:38:42.340
<v Speaker 4>That's how I took my non-reality.</v>

3937
01:38:42.730 --> 01:38:43.240
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3938
01:38:43.240 --> 01:38:45.600
<v Speaker 1>As you think about doing it in Montana when I was there last weekend,</v>

3939
01:38:45.610 --> 01:38:47.140
<v Speaker 1>but I was like that's a heavy a place to do it.</v>

3940
01:38:47.170 --> 01:38:47.771
<v Speaker 1>A bad ass.</v>

3941
01:38:47.771 --> 01:38:48.221
<v Speaker 1>But there's,</v>

3942
01:38:48.221 --> 01:38:49.420
<v Speaker 1>to me there's people,</v>

3943
01:38:49.421 --> 01:38:50.590
<v Speaker 1>there was people there by the way,</v>

3944
01:38:50.591 --> 01:38:51.820
<v Speaker 1>I didn't mean to tell you about this yet.</v>

3945
01:38:51.850 --> 01:38:53.260
<v Speaker 1>There was at the hotel,</v>

3946
01:38:53.410 --> 01:38:56.170
<v Speaker 1>there was these two guys on motorcycles and they had like this little girl that</v>

3947
01:38:56.171 --> 01:38:59.650
<v Speaker 1>was like four years old and they were like checking in and I was like behind</v>

3948
01:38:59.651 --> 01:39:00.000
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

3949
01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:01.780
<v Speaker 1>So you're riding on a motorcycle with a four year old.</v>

3950
01:39:01.810 --> 01:39:02.021
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3951
01:39:02.021 --> 01:39:03.010
<v Speaker 1>it was weird man.</v>

3952
01:39:03.310 --> 01:39:04.570
<v Speaker 1>And so you could do that,</v>

3953
01:39:04.571 --> 01:39:06.880
<v Speaker 1>right if you were in charge of a four year old and you can probably take them on</v>

3954
01:39:06.881 --> 01:39:07.051
<v Speaker 1>a bus.</v>

3955
01:39:07.051 --> 01:39:09.880
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if this legal and so the good and that hotel and they're like,</v>

3956
01:39:09.881 --> 01:39:10.001
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3957
01:39:10.001 --> 01:39:10.930
<v Speaker 1>we needed a bedroom.</v>

3958
01:39:10.930 --> 01:39:11.321
<v Speaker 1>And they're like,</v>

3959
01:39:11.321 --> 01:39:11.801
<v Speaker 1>how many beds?</v>

3960
01:39:11.801 --> 01:39:12.760
<v Speaker 1>And are just like one.</v>

3961
01:39:13.130 --> 01:39:13.841
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

3962
01:39:13.841 --> 01:39:14.230
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

3963
01:39:14.230 --> 01:39:16.450
<v Speaker 1>there's two guys in a little girl.</v>

3964
01:39:16.740 --> 01:39:17.171
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

3965
01:39:17.171 --> 01:39:17.680
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

3966
01:39:17.680 --> 01:39:17.961
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3967
01:39:17.961 --> 01:39:19.060
<v Speaker 1>like that's all I can afford.</v>

3968
01:39:19.170 --> 01:39:19.391
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3969
01:39:19.391 --> 01:39:19.781
<v Speaker 1>beds.</v>

3970
01:39:19.781 --> 01:39:20.614
<v Speaker 1>I mean Ben,</v>

3971
01:39:20.880 --> 01:39:21.040
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3972
01:39:21.040 --> 01:39:22.340
<v Speaker 1>you could get it isn't,</v>

3973
01:39:22.390 --> 01:39:22.530
<v Speaker 1>it?</v>

3974
01:39:22.530 --> 01:39:24.100
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't it costs more money for a room too.</v>

3975
01:39:24.120 --> 01:39:25.360
<v Speaker 1>But usually I don't think it does,</v>

3976
01:39:25.361 --> 01:39:26.194
<v Speaker 1>but what are,</v>

3977
01:39:26.290 --> 01:39:26.441
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3978
01:39:26.441 --> 01:39:29.290
<v Speaker 1>and then later I saw them again and they were like in the pool.</v>

3979
01:39:29.320 --> 01:39:30.470
<v Speaker 1>One of the guys was in port,</v>

3980
01:39:30.471 --> 01:39:31.001
<v Speaker 1>the looker on,</v>

3981
01:39:31.001 --> 01:39:31.834
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>

3982
01:39:31.920 --> 01:39:32.530
<v Speaker 1>you're the,</v>

3983
01:39:32.530 --> 01:39:35.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm the best uncle ever write their daughter or,</v>

3984
01:39:35.641 --> 01:39:36.400
<v Speaker 1>or deer.</v>

3985
01:39:36.400 --> 01:39:37.233
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

3986
01:39:37.330 --> 01:39:40.870
<v Speaker 1>is he saying that louder on purposes cause I'm walking by or something.</v>

3987
01:39:42.500 --> 01:39:43.470
<v Speaker 1>It was just really odd.</v>

3988
01:39:43.480 --> 01:39:45.950
<v Speaker 1>He was putting on a show like you can't uncle and then he's really,</v>

3989
01:39:46.960 --> 01:39:47.330
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

3990
01:39:47.330 --> 01:39:47.750
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

3991
01:39:47.750 --> 01:39:49.120
<v Speaker 1>it was really awkward.</v>

3992
01:39:49.121 --> 01:39:49.331
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

3993
01:39:49.331 --> 01:39:49.991
<v Speaker 1>so then I was like,</v>

3994
01:39:49.991 --> 01:39:50.261
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

3995
01:39:50.261 --> 01:39:51.071
<v Speaker 1>I'm not gonna eat mushrooms here.</v>

3996
01:39:51.071 --> 01:39:52.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to</v>

3997
01:39:54.040 --> 01:39:55.680
<v Speaker 1>be really aware of your environment.</v>

3998
01:39:55.710 --> 01:39:57.130
<v Speaker 1>You want to start fucking around with,</v>

3999
01:39:57.131 --> 01:40:01.810
<v Speaker 1>you already have like some thoughts going on that are negative or something you</v>

4000
01:40:01.811 --> 01:40:02.644
<v Speaker 1>don't want to.</v>

4001
01:40:03.020 --> 01:40:05.870
<v Speaker 4>I think this is how I would recommend you go about it.</v>

4002
01:40:06.110 --> 01:40:06.950
<v Speaker 4>Number one,</v>

4003
01:40:07.400 --> 01:40:07.950
<v Speaker 4>fucking,</v>

4004
01:40:07.950 --> 01:40:10.490
<v Speaker 4>if anybody wants to do anything psychedelic,</v>

4005
01:40:10.491 --> 01:40:15.170
<v Speaker 4>if you wanted to have like a guideline of how to have a psychedelic experience,</v>

4006
01:40:15.380 --> 01:40:17.210
<v Speaker 4>number one plan on doing it.</v>

4007
01:40:17.890 --> 01:40:20.900
<v Speaker 4>Or someone would say you're gonna give yourself x amount of time and then you're</v>

4008
01:40:20.901 --> 01:40:21.321
<v Speaker 4>going to do it.</v>

4009
01:40:21.321 --> 01:40:22.220
<v Speaker 4>And in between that,</v>

4010
01:40:22.430 --> 01:40:23.450
<v Speaker 4>take care of your health.</v>

4011
01:40:23.540 --> 01:40:24.530
<v Speaker 4>Eat good foods,</v>

4012
01:40:24.560 --> 01:40:26.710
<v Speaker 4>don't eat anything fast up fast though.</v>

4013
01:40:27.110 --> 01:40:28.400
<v Speaker 4>The day you do it fast,</v>

4014
01:40:28.401 --> 01:40:29.234
<v Speaker 4>the day you do it,</v>

4015
01:40:29.240 --> 01:40:31.910
<v Speaker 4>but keep your body clean like you'll feel,</v>

4016
01:40:31.911 --> 01:40:32.570
<v Speaker 4>feel better,</v>

4017
01:40:32.570 --> 01:40:33.650
<v Speaker 4>do some yoga,</v>

4018
01:40:33.920 --> 01:40:37.700
<v Speaker 4>do some yoga like the day before you do any sort of a psychedelic experience.</v>

4019
01:40:37.880 --> 01:40:39.440
<v Speaker 4>If you could do it for a couple days,</v>

4020
01:40:39.470 --> 01:40:42.230
<v Speaker 4>you know a week for like two weeks and then have the experience.</v>

4021
01:40:42.500 --> 01:40:43.940
<v Speaker 4>You want to be relaxed,</v>

4022
01:40:43.970 --> 01:40:48.410
<v Speaker 4>you want to be as calm and as at peace with yourself and then I would recommend</v>

4023
01:40:48.411 --> 01:40:50.900
<v Speaker 4>if you can get to a tank and do,</v>

4024
01:40:50.930 --> 01:40:52.010
<v Speaker 4>do an isolation tank.</v>

4025
01:40:52.250 --> 01:40:52.710
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

4026
01:40:52.710 --> 01:40:54.010
<v Speaker 4>tripping balls and find your,</v>

4027
01:40:54.090 --> 01:40:57.160
<v Speaker 1>cause you could find yourself in the tank and then when you meet yourself,</v>

4028
01:40:57.161 --> 01:40:57.911
<v Speaker 1>when you're on mushrooms,</v>

4029
01:40:57.911 --> 01:41:00.090
<v Speaker 1>you won't be as shocking because you were,</v>

4030
01:41:00.140 --> 01:41:01.600
<v Speaker 1>you'd already found yourself in the tank.</v>

4031
01:41:01.610 --> 01:41:01.841
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

4032
01:41:01.841 --> 01:41:02.141
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

4033
01:41:02.141 --> 01:41:02.974
<v Speaker 1>here I am again.</v>

4034
01:41:03.280 --> 01:41:06.400
<v Speaker 1>Okay with this time I'm ready for this and I'm going to escape through this.</v>

4035
01:41:06.401 --> 01:41:09.280
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to realize what this is all about because in a tank you could always</v>

4036
01:41:09.281 --> 01:41:09.940
<v Speaker 1>just stop it.</v>

4037
01:41:09.940 --> 01:41:12.310
<v Speaker 1>You can't stop the mushroom trip in the tank.</v>

4038
01:41:12.340 --> 01:41:13.390
<v Speaker 1>If you're freaking out in the tank,</v>

4039
01:41:13.391 --> 01:41:14.230
<v Speaker 1>you could just open your eyes,</v>

4040
01:41:14.231 --> 01:41:16.480
<v Speaker 1>stand up and get out and you're a sober like that.</v>

4041
01:41:16.720 --> 01:41:17.890
<v Speaker 1>It's instantaneous.</v>

4042
01:41:18.060 --> 01:41:19.090
<v Speaker 1>It's cause it's all,</v>

4043
01:41:19.380 --> 01:41:19.730
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

4044
01:41:19.730 --> 01:41:23.650
<v Speaker 1>it's a natural psychedelic experience and your body can snap right back to</v>

4045
01:41:23.651 --> 01:41:24.460
<v Speaker 1>normal,</v>

4046
01:41:24.460 --> 01:41:25.293
<v Speaker 1>not tripping,</v>

4047
01:41:25.510 --> 01:41:26.440
<v Speaker 1>just tank,</v>

4048
01:41:26.650 --> 01:41:26.990
<v Speaker 1>tank,</v>

4049
01:41:26.990 --> 01:41:28.450
<v Speaker 1>tank by itself as a trip.</v>

4050
01:41:28.540 --> 01:41:29.500
<v Speaker 1>You don't need to do anything.</v>

4051
01:41:29.680 --> 01:41:30.513
<v Speaker 1>Small Hall,</v>

4052
01:41:31.360 --> 01:41:33.010
<v Speaker 1>just a little bit too hits is all you need.</v>

4053
01:41:33.010 --> 01:41:35.020
<v Speaker 1>Go in that tank and you've done it.</v>

4054
01:41:35.021 --> 01:41:35.591
<v Speaker 1>You've done the tank,</v>

4055
01:41:35.591 --> 01:41:36.100
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

4056
01:41:36.100 --> 01:41:36.933
<v Speaker 1>Never</v>

4057
01:41:38.380 --> 01:41:39.213
<v Speaker 1>got no balls.</v>

4058
01:41:39.460 --> 01:41:41.640
<v Speaker 1>Want to try that balls with a razor.</v>

4059
01:41:41.641 --> 01:41:42.520
<v Speaker 1>They had drained out.</v>

4060
01:41:42.580 --> 01:41:47.020
<v Speaker 1>Honestly to me it seems like I would probably enjoy it but it's like I get,</v>

4061
01:41:47.040 --> 01:41:48.640
<v Speaker 1>I get the idea in my head and I'm like,</v>

4062
01:41:48.641 --> 01:41:48.960
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

4063
01:41:48.960 --> 01:41:50.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure it'll be relaxing and nice.</v>

4064
01:41:50.440 --> 01:41:52.430
<v Speaker 1>I've talked about it too much and now it's,</v>

4065
01:41:52.470 --> 01:41:53.420
<v Speaker 1>it's fucked in.</v>

4066
01:41:53.421 --> 01:41:56.260
<v Speaker 1>He'll never be able to go into it because he gets in there and just be thinking</v>

4067
01:41:56.261 --> 01:42:00.800
<v Speaker 1>about me talking about [inaudible] will pop in my face and I'll go through a of,</v>

4068
01:42:02.750 --> 01:42:05.080
<v Speaker 1>I do want to try on a torrent cricket.</v>

4069
01:42:05.290 --> 01:42:05.831
<v Speaker 1>You shouldn't try it.</v>

4070
01:42:05.831 --> 01:42:06.491
<v Speaker 1>A long time ago.</v>

4071
01:42:06.491 --> 01:42:07.324
<v Speaker 1>She doesn't try.</v>

4072
01:42:07.510 --> 01:42:08.800
<v Speaker 1>Then once you do that,</v>

4073
01:42:08.830 --> 01:42:10.390
<v Speaker 1>then you're prepared.</v>

4074
01:42:10.480 --> 01:42:11.590
<v Speaker 1>Then you got to prepare yourself,</v>

4075
01:42:11.650 --> 01:42:12.421
<v Speaker 1>have a couple of tanks,</v>

4076
01:42:12.421 --> 01:42:13.180
<v Speaker 1>experiences,</v>

4077
01:42:13.180 --> 01:42:15.730
<v Speaker 1>then jump into the wonderful world of mushrooms,</v>

4078
01:42:16.030 --> 01:42:19.330
<v Speaker 1>but not until then prepare yourself and that's the problem man.</v>

4079
01:42:19.330 --> 01:42:20.950
<v Speaker 1>That's the problem with it being illegal.</v>

4080
01:42:21.040 --> 01:42:22.150
<v Speaker 1>If that shit was legal,</v>

4081
01:42:22.180 --> 01:42:24.610
<v Speaker 1>we could open up centers and we could fix people.</v>

4082
01:42:24.970 --> 01:42:26.140
<v Speaker 1>We could help a lot of people.</v>

4083
01:42:26.141 --> 01:42:26.590
<v Speaker 1>Not Wheat,</v>

4084
01:42:26.590 --> 01:42:26.981
<v Speaker 1>not me.</v>

4085
01:42:26.981 --> 01:42:27.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm not opening up shit.</v>

4086
01:42:27.941 --> 01:42:28.750
<v Speaker 1>Don't ask me.</v>

4087
01:42:28.750 --> 01:42:28.991
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4088
01:42:28.991 --> 01:42:30.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm not joining your business.</v>

4089
01:42:30.191 --> 01:42:30.730
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4090
01:42:30.730 --> 01:42:30.971
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

01:42:32.381 --> 01:42:32.800
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4093
01:42:32.800 --> 01:42:33.131
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

4094
01:42:33.131 --> 01:42:34.270
<v Speaker 1>I ain't got no time.</v>

4095
01:42:34.840 --> 01:42:36.490
<v Speaker 1>I mean we as in the human race,</v>

4096
01:42:36.670 --> 01:42:37.570
<v Speaker 1>there was a lot of streams.</v>

4097
01:42:37.571 --> 01:42:38.060
<v Speaker 1>I think this is,</v>

4098
01:42:38.060 --> 01:42:38.831
<v Speaker 1>I was in Asheville,</v>

4099
01:42:38.831 --> 01:42:39.510
<v Speaker 1>North Carolina.</v>

4100
01:42:39.510 --> 01:42:40.570
<v Speaker 1>He was a lot of shootings up.</v>

4101
01:42:40.610 --> 01:42:41.530
<v Speaker 1>They allowed US rooms.</v>

4102
01:42:41.531 --> 01:42:43.150
<v Speaker 1>There was a cool place for Schumann.</v>

4103
01:42:43.210 --> 01:42:43.901
<v Speaker 1>Yeah man.</v>

4104
01:42:43.901 --> 01:42:44.850
<v Speaker 1>And there was this,</v>

4105
01:42:44.900 --> 01:42:45.790
<v Speaker 1>I had a great,</v>

4106
01:42:45.791 --> 01:42:48.370
<v Speaker 1>I did the Asheville comedy festival this past weekend,</v>

4107
01:42:48.820 --> 01:42:49.690
<v Speaker 1>this past weekend.</v>

4108
01:42:49.691 --> 01:42:50.410
<v Speaker 1>This past weekend.</v>

4109
01:42:50.410 --> 01:42:50.771
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

4110
01:42:50.771 --> 01:42:52.050
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even know they had a comedy.</v>

4111
01:42:52.070 --> 01:42:52.581
<v Speaker 1>So there who,</v>

4112

<v Speaker 1>who you up there with?</v>

4113
01:42:53.940 --> 01:42:55.000
<v Speaker 1>It was called laugh.</v>

4114
01:42:55.001 --> 01:42:57.220
<v Speaker 1>You're Asheville off is the name of the festival.</v>

4115
01:42:57.280 --> 01:42:57.761
<v Speaker 1>It's clever.</v>

4116
01:42:57.761 --> 01:42:58.331
<v Speaker 1>Play on words.</v>

4117
01:42:58.331 --> 01:42:58.780
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

4118
01:42:58.780 --> 01:43:01.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm taking my Alpha brainwave formula right now.</v>

4119
01:43:02.550 --> 01:43:03.580
<v Speaker 1>I'd take three.</v>

4123
01:43:09.490 --> 01:43:10.240
<v Speaker 1>By the way.</v>

4130
01:43:16.240 --> 01:43:18.580
<v Speaker 1>We can show you positive and negative examples of drugs.</v>

4131
01:43:18.581 --> 01:43:19.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm a much nicer person,</v>

4132
01:43:19.511 --> 01:43:20.500
<v Speaker 1>but because of drugs,</v>

<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

4134
01:43:20.741 --> 01:43:21.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm much nicer,</v>

4135
01:43:21.581 --> 01:43:22.540

4138
01:43:26.381 --> 01:43:27.970
<v Speaker 1>our friend Chris who changed his name to Aubrey.</v>

4145
01:43:34.631 --> 01:43:38.140
<v Speaker 1>dig deep into the jungles of the mind to the point where he wanted to stop being</v>

4146
01:43:38.141 --> 01:43:39.070
<v Speaker 1>the person who he was.</v>

4147
01:43:39.190 --> 01:43:40.450
<v Speaker 1>So he changed his fucking name.</v>

4148
01:43:40.720 --> 01:43:44.140
<v Speaker 1>Shazamm did you see a coffer brain formula?</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's coming out soon.</v>

4150
01:43:45.130 --> 01:43:47.300

4155
01:43:51.470 --> 01:43:52.070

4156
01:43:52.070 --> 01:43:52.820
<v Speaker 4>What is my,</v>

4157
01:43:52.820 --> 01:43:54.200
<v Speaker 4>my shit that we're going to be selling.</v>

4158
01:43:54.520 --> 01:43:56.990
<v Speaker 4>It's a nootropics and what it is in ward,</v>

4159
01:43:56.991 --> 01:43:57.330
<v Speaker 4>we're going to be,</v>

4160
01:43:57.330 --> 01:43:57.921
<v Speaker 4>we're done with this.</v>

4161
01:43:57.921 --> 01:44:00.890
<v Speaker 4>He's coming the end of July,</v>

4162
01:44:00.890 --> 01:44:00.891
<v Speaker 4>July,</v>

4163
01:44:00.891 --> 01:44:01.724
<v Speaker 4>early August.</v>

4164
01:44:01.760 --> 01:44:02.120
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

4165
01:44:02.120 --> 01:44:02.661
<v Speaker 4>and then we're going to,</v>

4166
01:44:02.661 --> 01:44:03.410
<v Speaker 4>it will,</v>

4167
01:44:03.410 --> 01:44:04.750
<v Speaker 4>it'll launch right after that.</v>

4168
01:44:04.790 --> 01:44:08.360
<v Speaker 4>What it is is it's basically the highest level brain nutrients that we could</v>

4169
01:44:08.361 --> 01:44:09.680
<v Speaker 4>find mixed them all together.</v>

4170
01:44:09.780 --> 01:44:10.730
<v Speaker 4>And Chris,</v>

4171
01:44:10.760 --> 01:44:11.181
<v Speaker 4>excuse me,</v>

4172
01:44:11.181 --> 01:44:15.470
<v Speaker 4>Aubrey worked very hard on this formula and tweaked it and you know,</v>

4173
01:44:15.471 --> 01:44:19.040
<v Speaker 4>it's basically all the information's available online and all this stuff is</v>

4174
01:44:19.041 --> 01:44:19.520
<v Speaker 4>available.</v>

4175
01:44:19.520 --> 01:44:20.353
<v Speaker 4>We don't have,</v>

4176
01:44:20.360 --> 01:44:21.140
<v Speaker 4>we don't have anything.</v>

4177
01:44:21.140 --> 01:44:23.270
<v Speaker 4>There's nothing in here that you can't buy individually.</v>

4178
01:44:23.450 --> 01:44:23.991
<v Speaker 4>So I mean,</v>

4179
01:44:23.991 --> 01:44:26.720
<v Speaker 4>if you can't afford this or if you know you want to try it yourself,</v>

4180
01:44:26.721 --> 01:44:29.570
<v Speaker 4>you can always just find out what the ingredients are and go replicate it</v>

4181
01:44:29.571 --> 01:44:30.050
<v Speaker 4>yourself.</v>

4182
01:44:30.050 --> 01:44:34.760
<v Speaker 4>But what we've done is we put it all together into one pill form and you take it</v>

4183
01:44:34.761 --> 01:44:36.020
<v Speaker 4>and it does something,</v>

4184
01:44:36.050 --> 01:44:38.330
<v Speaker 4>I don't know exactly what you could say it does,</v>

4185
01:44:38.480 --> 01:44:40.400
<v Speaker 4>but it makes you feel sharper,</v>

4186
01:44:40.550 --> 01:44:42.140
<v Speaker 4>release your brain fire better.</v>

4187
01:44:42.170 --> 01:44:42.321
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

4188
01:44:42.321 --> 01:44:42.980
<v Speaker 4>for sure.</v>

4189
01:44:42.980 --> 01:44:46.850
<v Speaker 4>It makes me feel less tired when I have jet lag.</v>

4190
01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:47.960
<v Speaker 4>When I check into hotels,</v>

4191
01:44:47.961 --> 01:44:50.140
<v Speaker 4>I take three of them as soon as I land and I,</v>

4192
01:44:50.141 --> 01:44:51.380
<v Speaker 4>I always feel much better.</v>

4193
01:44:51.590 --> 01:44:54.290
<v Speaker 4>I feel much more relaxed when I wake up.</v>

4194
01:44:54.770 --> 01:44:55.341
<v Speaker 4>It's weird,</v>

4195
01:44:55.341 --> 01:44:55.760
<v Speaker 4>dude.</v>

4196
01:44:55.760 --> 01:44:57.440
<v Speaker 4>My dreams are insane.</v>

4197
01:44:57.490 --> 01:44:57.680
<v Speaker 4>Wait,</v>

4198
01:44:57.680 --> 01:44:59.540
<v Speaker 4>that's why I had my Arnold Schwarzenegger dream.</v>

4199
01:44:59.800 --> 01:45:00.633
<v Speaker 4>Take this too.</v>

4200
01:45:00.750 --> 01:45:01.480

4203
01:45:03.231 --> 01:45:04.310
<v Speaker 4>This is the newest of the newest.</v>

4204
01:45:04.790 --> 01:45:05.420

4205
01:45:05.420 --> 01:45:07.940

4206
01:45:07.970 --> 01:45:08.870
<v Speaker 4>What's it called again?</v>

4207
01:45:09.170 --> 01:45:09.501
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

4208
01:45:09.501 --> 01:45:10.334
<v Speaker 4>we have,</v>

4209
01:45:10.460 --> 01:45:11.840
<v Speaker 4>let me see what we're calling it right now.</v>

4210
01:45:11.930 --> 01:45:13.550
<v Speaker 4>It's Alpha is calling an Alpha,</v>

4211
01:45:13.551 --> 01:45:15.110
<v Speaker 4>so it's done on it labs.</v>

4212
01:45:15.450 --> 01:45:16.140
<v Speaker 4>Oh Man.</v>

4214
01:45:18.141 --> 01:45:19.040
<v Speaker 4>Is it on it labs?</v>

4215
01:45:19.430 --> 01:45:20.840
<v Speaker 4>I think it's just on it dot.</v>

4216
01:45:20.930 --> 01:45:21.940
<v Speaker 4>Maybe a hold on.</v>

4217
01:45:22.160 --> 01:45:24.590
<v Speaker 4>But they also make a product called roll on and roll off.</v>

4218
01:45:24.620 --> 01:45:25.460
<v Speaker 4>When I do shrooms,</v>

4219
01:45:25.461 --> 01:45:27.950
<v Speaker 4>I do row on before I do showrooms.</v>

4220
01:45:27.951 --> 01:45:32.490
<v Speaker 4>And then the next day it's to balance out your neurochemistry.</v>

<v Speaker 6>but they're massive.</v>

4242
01:45:59.570 --> 01:46:00.520
<v Speaker 6>They're massive,</v>

4243
01:46:01.120 --> 01:46:02.650
<v Speaker 6>huge things where it's like,</v>

<v Speaker 6>Huge.</v>

4259

<v Speaker 6>I heard that a lot of the international guys are really bad.</v>

4260
01:46:28.480 --> 01:46:29.200
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

01:47:26.760 --> 01:47:27.300
<v Speaker 6>sure.</v>

4302
01:47:27.300 --> 01:47:31.230
<v Speaker 6>And I also feel like they give themselves extra credit for being clever.</v>

4303
01:47:31.231 --> 01:47:32.100
<v Speaker 6>Like they'll kind of be like,</v>

4304
01:47:32.130 --> 01:47:32.640
<v Speaker 6>hmm.</v>

4305
01:47:32.640 --> 01:47:34.500
<v Speaker 6>Like you didn't get that dumb shit.</v>

4306
01:47:34.560 --> 01:47:36.420
<v Speaker 6>Well that was fucking brilliant thing that I just said.</v>

4307
01:47:36.480 --> 01:47:36.960
<v Speaker 6>Absolutely.</v>

4308
01:47:36.960 --> 01:47:37.631
<v Speaker 6>Stewart lead.</v>

4309
01:47:37.631 --> 01:47:38.271
<v Speaker 6>Do you know who he is?</v>

4310
01:47:38.271 --> 01:47:39.104
<v Speaker 6>The English guy.</v>

4311
01:47:39.930 --> 01:47:40.860
<v Speaker 6>Interesting stuff.</v>

4312
01:47:40.910 --> 01:47:41.910
<v Speaker 6>Very funny stuff.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

4314
01:47:42.480 --> 01:47:45.780
<v Speaker 6>But I always wonder like how would that translate in America?</v>

4315
01:47:45.960 --> 01:47:50.700
<v Speaker 6>Because he has this really slow style that sort of depends on everyone paying</v>

4316
01:47:50.701 --> 01:47:52.560
<v Speaker 6>attention and everyone being polite.</v>

4318
01:47:53.400 --> 01:47:55.440

4319
01:47:55.441 --> 01:48:00.441
<v Speaker 6>like definitely in Australia where like at least at these festival shows where</v>

<v Speaker 6>right.</v>

4379
01:49:22.300 --> 01:49:23.450
<v Speaker 6>And you have,</v>

4380
01:49:23.490 --> 01:49:28.190
<v Speaker 6>you do it like they're like 20 minutes and set goes well and you get laughed and</v>

4381
01:49:28.191 --> 01:49:28.441
<v Speaker 6>you're like,</v>

4382
01:49:28.441 --> 01:49:28.981
<v Speaker 6>this is amazing.</v>

4383
01:49:28.981 --> 01:49:31.530
<v Speaker 6>You finished and they give you like a nice applaud.</v>

4384
01:49:31.531 --> 01:49:36.300
<v Speaker 6>And then you think you have a gauge for how loud that's going to be.</v>

4385
01:49:36.390 --> 01:49:36.781
<v Speaker 6>You know what I mean?</v>

4386
01:49:36.781 --> 01:49:40.710

4387
01:49:40.711 --> 01:49:44.310
<v Speaker 6>I mean if you really kill you're like so that's how like it can get loud and</v>

4388
01:49:44.311 --> 01:49:45.780
<v Speaker 6>like you gauge how loud that is.</v>

4389
01:49:46.230 --> 01:49:50.530
<v Speaker 6>I thought that because I had gotten laughs during my set like well that's what</v>

4390
01:49:50.531 --> 01:49:52.330
<v Speaker 6>it'll sound like man.</v>

4391
01:49:52.360 --> 01:49:57.360
<v Speaker 6>When they said they had an intro to him coming on stage and the intro was</v>

4392
01:49:57.641 --> 01:49:59.500
<v Speaker 6>prerecorded by Michael Buffer.</v>

4471
01:52:05.371 --> 01:52:05.640
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

4472
01:52:05.640 --> 01:52:05.921

<v Speaker 5>would you just think I was crazy for moving there?</v>

4474
01:52:07.520 --> 01:52:07.940
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

4475
01:52:07.940 --> 01:52:09.330
<v Speaker 5>What did you think when you went up there though?</v>

4476
01:52:09.331 --> 01:52:10.500
<v Speaker 5>It had to be a weird,</v>

4477
01:52:10.820 --> 01:52:11.011
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

4478
01:52:11.011 --> 01:52:11.521
<v Speaker 5>when someone says,</v>

4479
01:52:11.521 --> 01:52:11.880
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

4480
01:52:11.880 --> 01:52:12.271
<v Speaker 5>I'm on,</v>

4481
01:52:12.271 --> 01:52:13.920
<v Speaker 5>I'm gonna take you on a ride to the top of a mountain,</v>

4482
01:52:13.921 --> 01:52:14.750
<v Speaker 5>down a dirt road,</v>

4483
01:52:14.750 --> 01:52:15.111
<v Speaker 5>the square,</v>

4484
01:52:15.111 --> 01:52:16.830
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to sleep with my kids at night.</v>

4485
01:52:16.920 --> 01:52:18.030
<v Speaker 5>I thought like,</v>

4486
01:52:18.360 --> 01:52:19.500
<v Speaker 5>my real reaction was,</v>

4487
01:52:19.501 --> 01:52:20.334
<v Speaker 5>this is awesome.</v>

4488
01:52:20.370 --> 01:52:22.470
<v Speaker 5>I wish I was in a position that I could do something like this.</v>

4489
01:52:22.500 --> 01:52:23.333
<v Speaker 5>That was my genuine,</v>

4490
01:52:23.610 --> 01:52:24.540
<v Speaker 5>I didn't see it as like,</v>

4491
01:52:24.541 --> 01:52:25.410
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck is he doing?</v>

4492
01:52:25.420 --> 01:52:26.220
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

4493
01:52:26.220 --> 01:52:26.551
<v Speaker 5>Oh man,</v>

4494
01:52:26.551 --> 01:52:28.440
<v Speaker 5>I wish I could fucking do this too.</v>

4495
01:52:28.530 --> 01:52:29.580
<v Speaker 5>That was honestly how I felt.</v>

4496
01:52:29.790 --> 01:52:30.810
<v Speaker 5>There's two types of people.</v>

4497
01:52:30.811 --> 01:52:33.190
<v Speaker 5>There's people that thought that way like me and then there's people thought</v>

4498
01:52:33.210 --> 01:52:33.301
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

4499
01:52:33.301 --> 01:52:34.480
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck going on?</v>

4500
01:52:34.540 --> 01:52:35.700
<v Speaker 5>It was really cool.</v>

4501
01:52:35.790 --> 01:52:39.330
<v Speaker 5>But once I'm also like kind of antisocial,</v>

4502
01:52:39.390 --> 01:52:40.760
<v Speaker 5>like personally and like I'm,</v>

4503
01:52:40.761 --> 01:52:40.920
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>

4504
01:52:40.920 --> 01:52:41.610
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>

4505
01:52:41.610 --> 01:52:44.380
<v Speaker 5>I like speak kind of isolation and privacy.</v>

4506
01:52:44.410 --> 01:52:44.561
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

4507
01:52:44.561 --> 01:52:44.740
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

4508
01:52:44.740 --> 01:52:45.080
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

4509
01:52:45.080 --> 01:52:45.380
<v Speaker 5>totally.</v>

4510
01:52:45.380 --> 01:52:45.591
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

4511
01:52:45.591 --> 01:52:48.170
<v Speaker 5>I think the move is you got to have bowls,</v>

4512
01:52:48.320 --> 01:52:48.711
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4513
01:52:48.711 --> 01:52:51.710
<v Speaker 5>and I think with one of the reasons why a guy like you are a guy,</v>

4514
01:52:51.711 --> 01:52:56.711
<v Speaker 5>like I might want to have some peace and quiet alone is because performing can</v>

4515
01:52:56.841 --> 01:52:58.430
<v Speaker 5>be kind of overwhelming sometimes.</v>

4516
01:52:58.580 --> 01:52:59.060
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4517
01:52:59.060 --> 01:53:03.560
<v Speaker 5>I think in front of giant groups of people requires this intense amount of</v>

4518
01:53:03.561 --> 01:53:06.110
<v Speaker 5>energy and concentration and then you know,</v>

4519
01:53:06.130 --> 01:53:06.341
<v Speaker 5>then,</v>

4520
01:53:06.341 --> 01:53:08.180
<v Speaker 5>then there's also like meet and greets,</v>

4521
01:53:08.181 --> 01:53:08.451
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4522
01:53:08.451 --> 01:53:09.770
<v Speaker 5>after shows where it's like,</v>

4523
01:53:09.970 --> 01:53:10.250
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4524
01:53:10.250 --> 01:53:11.630
<v Speaker 5>I want to say hi to everybody I want to,</v>

4525
01:53:11.840 --> 01:53:13.250
<v Speaker 5>but then I want it.</v>

4526
01:53:13.280 --> 01:53:14.000
<v Speaker 5>Nothing.</v>

4527
01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:14.300
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4528
01:53:14.300 --> 01:53:18.590
<v Speaker 5>I want complete quiet and I like just to sit on a fucking tree,</v>

4529
01:53:18.890 --> 01:53:19.191
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4530
01:53:19.191 --> 01:53:22.490
<v Speaker 5>a fallen tree and look over at a lake and fucking go fishing.</v>

4531
01:53:22.610 --> 01:53:23.010
<v Speaker 5>I love it.</v>

4532
01:53:23.010 --> 01:53:23.271
<v Speaker 5>I want to,</v>

4533
01:53:23.271 --> 01:53:24.530
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to hear shit man.</v>

4534
01:53:24.770 --> 01:53:27.710
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to answer questions about when is Anderson Silva going to fight</v>

4535
01:53:27.711 --> 01:53:31.430
<v Speaker 5>fucking this guy because I don't want to hear shit dude by just to watch the</v>

4536
01:53:31.431 --> 01:53:32.264

4539
01:53:38.120 --> 01:53:42.950
<v Speaker 5>Like we turn down social invitations almost a hundred percent of the time</v>

4540
01:53:43.230 --> 01:53:44.063
<v Speaker 5>because we both,</v>

4541
01:53:44.180 --> 01:53:45.860
<v Speaker 5>we both perform and we get home.</v>

4542
01:53:45.861 --> 01:53:46.250
<v Speaker 5>We're like,</v>

4543
01:53:46.250 --> 01:53:47.083
<v Speaker 5>this is awesome.</v>

4544
01:53:47.180 --> 01:53:48.350
<v Speaker 5>We're just going to sit here on the couch.</v>

4545
01:53:48.650 --> 01:53:49.340
<v Speaker 5>This is great.</v>

4546
01:53:49.340 --> 01:53:49.650
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4547
01:53:49.650 --> 01:53:50.420
<v Speaker 5>Then the people are like,</v>

4548
01:53:50.420 --> 01:53:50.541
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

4549
01:53:50.541 --> 01:53:51.960
<v Speaker 5>but this thing is going to be awesome and we're like,</v>

4550
01:53:52.040 --> 01:53:52.160
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

01:53:52.160 --> 01:53:52.830

4552
01:53:52.830 --> 01:53:52.950

4554
01:53:53.960 --> 01:53:58.460

4555

4563
01:54:07.730 --> 01:54:12.730
<v Speaker 5>The view was incredible back there was that walk that we went on and that lady</v>

01:54:13.451 --> 01:54:16.280
<v Speaker 5>that she was such a cool lady that owned the place.</v>

4565
01:54:16.550 --> 01:54:17.510
<v Speaker 5>I really liked that lady.</v>

4566
01:54:17.511 --> 01:54:20.990
<v Speaker 5>She was awesome and she was really super yoga into yoga.</v>

4567
01:54:20.991 --> 01:54:21.860
<v Speaker 5>It's swimming and she was like,</v>

4568
01:54:21.861 --> 01:54:25.550
<v Speaker 5>here I stand in like the sun hit it and she had like a wooden thing and she was</v>

4569
01:54:25.551 --> 01:54:25.671
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

4570
01:54:25.671 --> 01:54:26.504

4575
01:54:31.221 --> 01:54:33.860

<v Speaker 5>be there and relax and kind of look at it and reset your perspective when you</v>

4583
01:54:47.721 --> 01:54:48.860
<v Speaker 5>enter into the hive again.</v>

4584
01:54:49.060 --> 01:54:49.281
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4585
01:54:49.281 --> 01:54:50.240
<v Speaker 5>When you were in the hive,</v>

4586
01:54:50.241 --> 01:54:51.530
<v Speaker 5>like we're in the high right now,</v>

4587
01:54:51.680 --> 01:54:51.981
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4588
01:54:51.981 --> 01:54:52.190
<v Speaker 5>there's,</v>

4589
01:54:52.190 --> 01:54:52.971
<v Speaker 5>even though we're,</v>

4590
01:54:52.971 --> 01:54:55.730
<v Speaker 5>we're kind of relaxed up here and it's kind of quiet where I live,</v>

4591
01:54:56.480 --> 01:54:58.340
<v Speaker 5>there's still millions of people in this area.</v>

4592
01:54:58.490 --> 01:55:00.590
<v Speaker 5>There's whether or not you realize it,</v>

4593
01:55:00.591 --> 01:55:02.270
<v Speaker 5>you're feeling that you know,</v>

4594
01:55:02.300 --> 01:55:02.541
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>

4595
01:55:02.541 --> 01:55:04.210
<v Speaker 5>you're hearing cars move your,</v>

4596
01:55:04.710 --> 01:55:07.400
<v Speaker 5>that has an impact on your breathing it well,</v>

4597
01:55:07.401 --> 01:55:07.641
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

4598
01:55:07.641 --> 01:55:08.780
<v Speaker 5>you're breathing it for sure.</v>

4599
01:55:08.781 --> 01:55:09.770
<v Speaker 5>That has a big impact.</v>

4600
01:55:09.800 --> 01:55:12.950
<v Speaker 5>And one of the things that I learned from that fucking isolation tank is that</v>

4601
01:55:12.951 --> 01:55:15.280
<v Speaker 5>the more you can remove the,</v>

4602
01:55:15.330 --> 01:55:20.330
<v Speaker 5>the more you can see things clear and removing things and distractions and bad</v>

4603
01:55:21.651 --> 01:55:22.700
<v Speaker 5>things from your environment.</v>

4604
01:55:23.030 --> 01:55:25.700
<v Speaker 5>When you have all these things in your environment and they're just there all</v>

4605
01:55:25.701 --> 01:55:26.151
<v Speaker 5>the time,</v>

4606
01:55:26.151 --> 01:55:28.070
<v Speaker 5>you don't ever think of removing them.</v>

4607
01:55:28.280 --> 01:55:29.480
<v Speaker 5>People who live in New York City,</v>

4608
01:55:29.481 --> 01:55:29.991
<v Speaker 5>they love it.</v>

4609
01:55:29.991 --> 01:55:30.860
<v Speaker 5>I love the action.</v>

4610
01:55:30.861 --> 01:55:31.671
<v Speaker 5>I love the sound.</v>

4611
01:55:31.671 --> 01:55:32.301
<v Speaker 5>I love this city.</v>

4612
01:55:32.301 --> 01:55:33.230
<v Speaker 5>It's amazing city.</v>

4613
01:55:33.440 --> 01:55:36.680
<v Speaker 5>You don't realize that city is bombarding you with sensory input,</v>

4614
01:55:37.040 --> 01:55:40.340
<v Speaker 5>bombarding you with information that you have to process all the time.</v>

4615
01:55:40.470 --> 01:55:43.010
<v Speaker 5>And some people enjoy that and it actually keeps them,</v>

4616
01:55:43.680 --> 01:55:44.513
<v Speaker 5>but</v>

4617
01:55:44.560 --> 01:55:45.050
<v Speaker 4>two,</v>

4618
01:55:45.050 --> 01:55:49.830
<v Speaker 4>to really get a fresh sense of who you are and what life is.</v>

4619
01:55:49.831 --> 01:55:52.560
<v Speaker 4>And you just just look at it at a one degree,</v>

4620
01:55:52.561 --> 01:55:53.550
<v Speaker 4>different angle.</v>

4621
01:55:53.640 --> 01:55:54.600
<v Speaker 4>Just get to the woods,</v>

4622
01:55:54.601 --> 01:55:55.290
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

4623
01:55:55.290 --> 01:55:56.280
<v Speaker 4>get to the shore,</v>

4624
01:55:56.430 --> 01:55:57.660
<v Speaker 4>could walk along the ocean,</v>

4625
01:55:57.661 --> 01:55:58.530
<v Speaker 4>stare out at that.</v>

4626
01:55:58.531 --> 01:55:59.880
<v Speaker 4>Never ending water.</v>

4627
01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:00.750
<v Speaker 4>There's put,</v>

4628
01:56:00.750 --> 01:56:04.710
<v Speaker 4>you need some form of visible nature to humble yourself,</v>

4629
01:56:05.370 --> 01:56:05.761
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

4630
01:56:05.761 --> 01:56:06.481
<v Speaker 4>And in California,</v>

4631
01:56:06.481 --> 01:56:08.520
<v Speaker 4>that's one of the reasons why people are such fucking twats.</v>

4632
01:56:08.760 --> 01:56:09.151
<v Speaker 4>There's no,</v>

4633
01:56:09.151 --> 01:56:10.920
<v Speaker 4>whether you have to deal with ever.</v>

4634
01:56:11.040 --> 01:56:12.930
<v Speaker 4>It's just beautiful out here all the time.</v>

4635
01:56:12.931 --> 01:56:13.471
<v Speaker 4>It's sunny.</v>

4636
01:56:13.471 --> 01:56:14.790
<v Speaker 4>It fucking hardly ever rains.</v>

4637
01:56:14.910 --> 01:56:15.391
<v Speaker 4>When it does,</v>

4638
01:56:15.391 --> 01:56:16.410
<v Speaker 4>it rains for a day,</v>

4639
01:56:16.530 --> 01:56:16.771
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4640
01:56:16.771 --> 01:56:18.150
<v Speaker 4>it might rain 10 days a year,</v>

4641
01:56:18.180 --> 01:56:18.511
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

4642
01:56:18.511 --> 01:56:18.721
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4643
01:56:18.721 --> 01:56:19.470
<v Speaker 4>what's the,</v>

4644
01:56:19.470 --> 01:56:23.580
<v Speaker 4>what's the most 2020 out of 365 it doesn't fucking rain very often,</v>

4645
01:56:23.581 --> 01:56:23.920
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

4646
01:56:23.920 --> 01:56:25.260
<v Speaker 4>We don't have to deal with wind.</v>

4647
01:56:25.410 --> 01:56:26.520
<v Speaker 4>We don't have to deal with shit.</v>

4648
01:56:26.520 --> 01:56:28.080
<v Speaker 4>Occasionally something lights on fire,</v>

4649
01:56:28.260 --> 01:56:32.430
<v Speaker 4>but that's why people are such cons out here because you need nature in your</v>

4650
01:56:32.431 --> 01:56:33.120
<v Speaker 4>face.</v>

4651
01:56:33.120 --> 01:56:34.860
<v Speaker 4>You need a thunderstorm man.</v>

4652
01:56:34.861 --> 01:56:37.860
<v Speaker 4>You need something like that to really like put it in perspective.</v>

4653
01:56:37.880 --> 01:56:38.400
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

4654
01:56:38.400 --> 01:56:38.641
<v Speaker 4>Man,</v>

4655
01:56:38.641 --> 01:56:41.670
<v Speaker 4>I need to be a little more humble about my position here.</v>

4656
01:56:42.120 --> 01:56:42.451
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

4657
01:56:42.451 --> 01:56:47.451
<v Speaker 4>I'm just a little tiny little organism clean to this giant things hurling</v>

4658
01:56:47.821 --> 01:56:48.654
<v Speaker 4>through the galaxy,</v>

4659
01:56:49.170 --> 01:56:49.411
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

4660
01:56:49.411 --> 01:56:51.230
<v Speaker 4>And the best way in my opinion to,</v>

4661
01:56:51.410 --> 01:56:54.120
<v Speaker 4>to feel that is to be somewhere natural.</v>

4662
01:56:54.121 --> 01:56:58.230
<v Speaker 4>Just interact with the earth somewhere where you could see a fucking forest</v>

4663
01:56:58.320 --> 01:57:02.730
<v Speaker 4>somewhere where you could see the ocean and seal fucking water that goes on as</v>

4664
01:57:02.731 --> 01:57:03.990
<v Speaker 4>far as you can see.</v>

4665
01:57:03.991 --> 01:57:06.930
<v Speaker 4>It's water and it's deep as fuck.</v>

4666
01:57:07.080 --> 01:57:11.070
<v Speaker 4>And all that has to do is the earth moves in a wave on a hundred feet high comes</v>

4667
01:57:11.071 --> 01:57:13.110
<v Speaker 4>flying at you at 50 miles an hour.</v>

4668
01:57:13.320 --> 01:57:14.240
<v Speaker 4>Fucking Jack Too.</v>

4669
01:57:14.730 --> 01:57:15.081
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4670
01:57:15.081 --> 01:57:15.310
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

4671
01:57:15.310 --> 01:57:15.800
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

4672
01:57:15.800 --> 01:57:16.940
<v Speaker 1>it changes the way you feel.</v>

4673
01:57:16.970 --> 01:57:18.040
<v Speaker 1>Fuck yeah it does.</v>

4674
01:57:18.110 --> 01:57:18.591
<v Speaker 1>I did a,</v>

4675
01:57:18.591 --> 01:57:19.520
<v Speaker 1>I went to Sun Valley,</v>

4676
01:57:19.521 --> 01:57:21.170
<v Speaker 1>Idaho this winter.</v>

4677
01:57:21.560 --> 01:57:22.610
<v Speaker 1>That was amazing man.</v>

4678
01:57:22.700 --> 01:57:22.971
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

4679
01:57:22.971 --> 01:57:23.571
<v Speaker 1>that's gorgeous.</v>

4680
01:57:23.571 --> 01:57:24.380
<v Speaker 1>My God,</v>

4681
01:57:24.380 --> 01:57:25.310
<v Speaker 1>that like that.</v>

4682
01:57:25.440 --> 01:57:27.430
<v Speaker 1>Like you literally angry up there with the legs,</v>

4683
01:57:27.431 --> 01:57:28.910
<v Speaker 1>like quarter lane and all that.</v>

4684
01:57:29.120 --> 01:57:29.660
<v Speaker 1>And then there's,</v>

4685
01:57:29.660 --> 01:57:29.961
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

4686
01:57:29.961 --> 01:57:32.150
<v Speaker 1>there's these beautiful mountains covered with snow.</v>

4687
01:57:32.151 --> 01:57:34.220
<v Speaker 1>Then there's huge trees and you're just,</v>

4688
01:57:34.250 --> 01:57:34.730

<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

4693
01:57:37.860 --> 01:57:42.860
<v Speaker 1>you're fucking whole physical being like tunes into it and then you relax more.</v>

4694
01:57:43.370 --> 01:57:44.270
<v Speaker 1>I wish I could have a house here.</v>

4695
01:57:44.430 --> 01:57:46.610
<v Speaker 1>That's the next thought you have fucking out of here.</v>

4696
01:57:46.700 --> 01:57:46.851
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4697
01:57:46.851 --> 01:57:49.910
<v Speaker 1>We have some friends that keep us summer house on,</v>

4698
01:57:49.911 --> 01:57:50.211
<v Speaker 1>on the,</v>

4699
01:57:50.211 --> 01:57:53.180
<v Speaker 1>on the lake out there and they're always talking about how amazing and they're</v>

4700
01:57:53.181 --> 01:57:54.380
<v Speaker 1>in the clothing business.</v>

01:57:54.381 --> 01:57:55.250
<v Speaker 1>So they were like real,</v>

4707
01:57:59.300 --> 01:58:01.860

<v Speaker 1>decompressing,</v>

<v Speaker 1>And he wants to move up there.</v>

4719
01:58:13.730 --> 01:58:14.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>So they,</v>

4725
01:58:19.461 --> 01:58:21.410
<v Speaker 1>they really can't just abandon everything.</v>

4726
01:58:21.411 --> 01:58:23.210
<v Speaker 1>They have like a high lifestyle to support,</v>

4727
01:58:23.530 --> 01:58:23.840
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

4728
01:58:23.840 --> 01:58:26.210
<v Speaker 1>But meanwhile they just want to just relax by the water.</v>

4729
01:58:26.211 --> 01:58:27.044
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

4730
01:58:27.500 --> 01:58:29.170
<v Speaker 1>Everybody wants that fucking feeling of,</v>

4731
01:58:29.420 --> 01:58:30.890
<v Speaker 1>of real retiring somewhere.</v>

4732
01:58:31.010 --> 01:58:35.390
<v Speaker 1>But you don't realize that that is very close to death kind of based.</v>

4733
01:58:35.480 --> 01:58:39.170
<v Speaker 1>At least a lot of people have who they are on what they do,</v>

4734
01:58:39.290 --> 01:58:40.400
<v Speaker 1>what they do for a living,</v>

4735
01:58:40.401 --> 01:58:42.130
<v Speaker 1>what they do for how they interact with people</v>

4736
01:58:42.130 --> 01:58:42.963
<v Speaker 5>and feel useful.</v>

4737
01:58:43.180 --> 01:58:46.120
<v Speaker 5>And as soon as you like slide away from that and just stay by yourself,</v>

4738
01:58:46.370 --> 01:58:47.141
<v Speaker 5>it takes a very,</v>

4739
01:58:47.141 --> 01:58:47.690
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4740
01:58:47.690 --> 01:58:51.370
<v Speaker 5>a very different mindset to enjoy that without starting to get depressed and</v>

4741
01:58:51.371 --> 01:58:53.770
<v Speaker 5>start feeling that you're dying and it's the end of the line for you,</v>

4742
01:58:53.950 --> 01:58:54.550
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

4743
01:58:54.550 --> 01:58:55.180
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4744
01:58:55.180 --> 01:58:55.421
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4745
01:58:55.421 --> 01:58:56.254
<v Speaker 5>Cause that is,</v>

4746
01:58:56.260 --> 01:58:58.450
<v Speaker 5>it really is putting the brakes on when you move somewhere.</v>

4747
01:58:58.480 --> 01:58:58.721
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

4748
01:58:58.721 --> 01:58:59.300
<v Speaker 5>Cause you,</v>

4749
01:58:59.300 --> 01:59:00.130
<v Speaker 5>but maybe it's your,</v>

4750
01:59:00.130 --> 01:59:02.260
<v Speaker 5>you're opening up to something else because you're,</v>

4751
01:59:02.560 --> 01:59:06.190
<v Speaker 5>instead of like your drive being for accomplishing more work,</v>

4752
01:59:06.191 --> 01:59:08.770
<v Speaker 5>like maybe you're just becoming a different type of person.</v>

4753
01:59:09.030 --> 01:59:09.340
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4754
01:59:09.340 --> 01:59:10.510
<v Speaker 5>Still doing some type of work.</v>

4755
01:59:10.511 --> 01:59:11.060
<v Speaker 5>I'm saying,</v>

4756
01:59:11.060 --> 01:59:11.540
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

4757
01:59:11.540 --> 01:59:12.970
<v Speaker 5>you're putting work into yourself more.</v>

4758
01:59:13.090 --> 01:59:13.271
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

4759
01:59:13.271 --> 01:59:16.360
<v Speaker 5>if you could figure out how to a hunter s Thompson it and how to just live up</v>

4760
01:59:16.361 --> 01:59:19.960
<v Speaker 5>there and then in travel in whenever you wanted and then interact with the</v>

4761
01:59:19.961 --> 01:59:21.700
<v Speaker 5>people and then head back out to your shelter.</v>

4762
01:59:21.760 --> 01:59:22.593
<v Speaker 5>Where would he live?</v>

4763
01:59:22.610 --> 01:59:25.240
<v Speaker 5>He lived in a woody creek in Colorado.</v>

4764
01:59:25.270 --> 01:59:26.950
<v Speaker 5>Colorado is a near Aspen,</v>

4765
01:59:27.430 --> 01:59:32.260
<v Speaker 5>really more remote even sort of than I was living because aspen is trickier to</v>

4766
01:59:32.261 --> 01:59:33.094
<v Speaker 5>get to,</v>

4767
01:59:33.130 --> 01:59:33.580
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4768
01:59:33.580 --> 01:59:34.840
<v Speaker 5>you fly right into Denver,</v>

4769
01:59:34.841 --> 01:59:36.220
<v Speaker 5>you drive an hour and you're in Boulder,</v>

4770
01:59:36.221 --> 01:59:37.840
<v Speaker 5>you drive 20 minutes or in the mountains.</v>

4771
01:59:37.900 --> 01:59:39.160
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's that this is that easy.</v>

4772
01:59:39.161 --> 01:59:43.150
<v Speaker 5>It's literally you're an hour and 20 minutes from your car to a where I lived.</v>

4773
01:59:43.360 --> 01:59:44.350
<v Speaker 5>That's not hard at all.</v>

4774
01:59:44.440 --> 01:59:44.771
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

4775
01:59:44.771 --> 01:59:46.570
<v Speaker 5>and you're in the fucking woods.</v>

4776
01:59:47.320 --> 01:59:49.330
<v Speaker 5>Where he was is a lot more difficult.</v>

4777
01:59:49.331 --> 01:59:54.010
<v Speaker 5>He had to fly in to aspen and aspen is like a little tiny ass airplane airport</v>

4778
01:59:54.011 --> 01:59:54.251
<v Speaker 5>rather.</v>

4779
01:59:54.251 --> 01:59:54.851
<v Speaker 5>And it doesn't,</v>

4780
01:59:54.851 --> 01:59:55.390
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

4781
01:59:55.390 --> 01:59:56.410
<v Speaker 5>it's not a good one either.</v>

4782
01:59:56.411 --> 01:59:59.610
<v Speaker 5>It's a funky one cause it's like nestled in between mountains and sometimes</v>

4783
01:59:59.620 --> 02:00:00.520
<v Speaker 5>people crash.</v>

4784
02:00:01.030 --> 02:00:02.890
<v Speaker 5>Like I knew they reroute you all the time too.</v>

4785
02:00:02.920 --> 02:00:03.610
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

4786
02:00:03.610 --> 02:00:05.860
<v Speaker 5>they rerouted us when we did the Aspen comedy festival.</v>

4787
02:00:06.190 --> 02:00:09.160
<v Speaker 5>They said the winds are too high and there's too much snow and we don't want to</v>

4788
02:00:09.161 --> 02:00:11.080
<v Speaker 5>slam into a fucking mountain that we can't see.</v>

4789
02:00:11.140 --> 02:00:12.400
<v Speaker 5>They didn't have to worry about that.</v>

4790
02:00:12.430 --> 02:00:14.320
<v Speaker 5>They did the Christina this year when she went there.</v>

4791
02:00:15.730 --> 02:00:17.290
<v Speaker 5>I did that for Sun Valley and they were like,</v>

4792
02:00:17.580 --> 02:00:18.420
<v Speaker 5>airports not working.</v>

4793
02:00:18.480 --> 02:00:19.150
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4797
02:00:25.391 --> 02:00:27.940
<v Speaker 5>They were in a private jet and they were headed out to aspen.</v>

4798
02:00:28.270 --> 02:00:30.430
<v Speaker 5>There were high rollers in the movie business.</v>

4799
02:00:30.580 --> 02:00:30.850
<v Speaker 5>Dan.</v>

4801
02:00:34.990 --> 02:00:39.880
<v Speaker 5>slammed into a mountains that you had that like if you were to get like that,</v>

4802
02:00:39.900 --> 02:00:42.190
<v Speaker 5>it seems like the worst thing is crashing in a private jet.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Like we were like let's do the fucking private jet shit man.</v>

4807
02:00:50.981 --> 02:00:54.730

<v Speaker 5>flight.</v>

02:02:25.080 --> 02:02:27.830
<v Speaker 1>You go into the side of warehouse and you get to walk through the whole thing</v>

4866
02:02:27.831 --> 02:02:28.220
<v Speaker 1>and they,</v>

4867
02:02:28.220 --> 02:02:29.053
<v Speaker 1>they put like little,</v>

4868
02:02:29.210 --> 02:02:33.560
<v Speaker 1>it was Ronald Reagan's and they put like a little jelly beans on his desk</v>

4869
02:02:33.590 --> 02:02:38.300
<v Speaker 1>because he liked jelly beans but doesn't have a one of those little escape pods.</v>

4870
02:02:38.540 --> 02:02:41.060
<v Speaker 1>And we would climb in it and then they hit the parachute and he fucking,</v>

4871
02:02:41.300 --> 02:02:43.190
<v Speaker 1>the plane falls apart and he escapes.</v>

4872
02:02:43.220 --> 02:02:43.791
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember,</v>

4873
02:02:43.791 --> 02:02:44.624
<v Speaker 1>but it was pimp,</v>

4874
02:02:45.150 --> 02:02:46.040
<v Speaker 1>pimp the what?</v>

4875
02:02:46.041 --> 02:02:46.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>

4876
02:02:46.550 --> 02:02:48.690
<v Speaker 1>You weren't even paying and I was reading wasn't,</v>

4877
02:02:49.440 --> 02:02:50.290
<v Speaker 1>I was reading the,</v>

4878
02:02:50.300 --> 02:02:51.070
<v Speaker 1>the uh,</v>

4879
02:02:51.070 --> 02:02:51.891
<v Speaker 1>did they have like,</v>

4880
02:02:51.891 --> 02:02:54.170
<v Speaker 1>remember how like I know at least in some movies,</v>

4881
02:02:54.320 --> 02:02:56.210
<v Speaker 1>Air Force One had like an escape pod,</v>

4882
02:02:56.211 --> 02:03:00.830
<v Speaker 1>the president Pi and it would like hell parachute would deploy or I don't think</v>

4883
02:03:00.840 --> 02:03:02.540
<v Speaker 1>this Jet Star Wars.</v>

4884
02:03:02.550 --> 02:03:02.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4885
02:03:02.870 --> 02:03:03.590
<v Speaker 1>Bullshit.</v>

4886
02:03:03.590 --> 02:03:04.490
<v Speaker 1>I think that's bullshit.</v>

4887
02:03:04.491 --> 02:03:05.510
<v Speaker 1>So if the plane crashes,</v>

4888
02:03:05.511 --> 02:03:06.344
<v Speaker 1>he's fucked.</v>

4889
02:03:06.710 --> 02:03:07.840
<v Speaker 1>They can't save the president.</v>

4890
02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:08.630
<v Speaker 1>The uh,</v>

4891
02:03:08.630 --> 02:03:09.381
<v Speaker 1>the seven,</v>

4892
02:03:09.381 --> 02:03:09.621
<v Speaker 1>eight,</v>

4893
02:03:09.621 --> 02:03:09.981
<v Speaker 1>seven,</v>

4894
02:03:09.981 --> 02:03:11.030
<v Speaker 1>I believe would get mad.</v>

4895
02:03:11.450 --> 02:03:11.721
<v Speaker 1>They'd go,</v>

4896
02:03:11.721 --> 02:03:12.710
<v Speaker 1>what can you save the President?</v>

4897
02:03:12.711 --> 02:03:13.730
<v Speaker 1>You can't say my little Billy.</v>

4898
02:03:13.790 --> 02:03:16.580
<v Speaker 1>I always wondered why they couldn't have fucking parachute.</v>

4899
02:03:16.590 --> 02:03:19.010
<v Speaker 1>That's a last resort somewhere on the plane,</v>

4900
02:03:19.011 --> 02:03:19.930
<v Speaker 1>just in case there's the whole,</v>

4901
02:03:20.060 --> 02:03:21.070
<v Speaker 1>Johnny B said it best.</v>

4902
02:03:21.080 --> 02:03:21.500
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

4903
02:03:21.500 --> 02:03:24.500
<v Speaker 1>why can't they have a power shoot for the whole fucking place?</v>

4904
02:03:25.580 --> 02:03:26.031
<v Speaker 1>That's what he said.</v>

4905
02:03:26.031 --> 02:03:27.620
<v Speaker 1>It ties this bro.</v>

4906
02:03:27.890 --> 02:03:28.520
<v Speaker 1>This bro,</v>

4907
02:03:28.520 --> 02:03:30.260
<v Speaker 1>I can fucking solve a airplane crashes.</v>

4908
02:03:30.261 --> 02:03:30.830
<v Speaker 1>What happens?</v>

4909
02:03:30.830 --> 02:03:31.760
<v Speaker 1>Playing breaks and sky.</v>

4910
02:03:31.790 --> 02:03:32.000
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

4911
02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:32.900
<v Speaker 1>you've got a parachute.</v>

4912
02:03:33.120 --> 02:03:34.490
<v Speaker 1>He used to just drift to the ground.</v>

4913
02:03:35.540 --> 02:03:36.373
<v Speaker 1>What can they do that?</v>

4914
02:03:36.530 --> 02:03:37.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4915
02:03:37.100 --> 02:03:37.520
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>

4916
02:03:37.520 --> 02:03:37.791
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>

4917
02:03:37.791 --> 02:03:38.301
<v Speaker 1>what does it cost?</v>

4918
02:03:38.301 --> 02:03:39.710
<v Speaker 1>How much is it fucking parachute?</v>

4919
02:03:39.920 --> 02:03:41.030
<v Speaker 1>You cheap pricks.</v>

4920
02:03:41.270 --> 02:03:44.480
<v Speaker 1>You can't even afford a fucking parachute and makes so much sense,</v>

4921
02:03:44.481 --> 02:03:44.900
<v Speaker 1>doesn't it?</v>

4922
02:03:44.900 --> 02:03:45.890
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make sense.</v>

4923
02:03:45.891 --> 02:03:46.640
<v Speaker 1>Does that make sense at all?</v>

4924
02:03:46.640 --> 02:03:50.060
<v Speaker 1>Because the way of the parachute combined with the way to the puck and play and</v>

4925
02:03:50.061 --> 02:03:52.010
<v Speaker 1>you'd probably run out of gas halfway to Idaho,</v>

4926
02:03:52.011 --> 02:03:53.150
<v Speaker 1>the shit would fall apart.</v>

4927
02:03:53.490 --> 02:03:55.670
<v Speaker 1>We all dude out of whack.</v>

4928
02:03:55.760 --> 02:04:00.660
<v Speaker 1>The Boeing business jets range and costs from 47 million to $310 million.</v>

4929
02:04:01.970 --> 02:04:03.290
<v Speaker 1>And you know she didn't get the cheap one.</v>

4930
02:04:03.320 --> 02:04:03.701
<v Speaker 1>Hell,</v>

4931
02:04:03.701 --> 02:04:04.950
<v Speaker 1>Oprah's a ballroom sign.</v>

4932
02:04:04.970 --> 02:04:06.320
<v Speaker 1>Blue Tooth right now.</v>

4933
02:04:06.321 --> 02:04:09.530
<v Speaker 1>She's got one ladies around her all the time filing her nails,</v>

4934
02:04:09.531 --> 02:04:10.370
<v Speaker 1>one on each toe.</v>

4935
02:04:10.371 --> 02:04:13.910
<v Speaker 1>They're all white girls to all white girls under 120 pounds.</v>

4936
02:04:13.911 --> 02:04:14.750
<v Speaker 1>It's all she asked for.</v>

4937
02:04:14.751 --> 02:04:16.160
<v Speaker 1>I want only white workers.</v>

4938
02:04:16.610 --> 02:04:19.520
<v Speaker 1>120 pounds or lighter skinny girls.</v>

4939
02:04:19.540 --> 02:04:20.361
<v Speaker 1>Pick a tone.</v>

4940
02:04:20.361 --> 02:04:20.991
<v Speaker 1>That's what she wants.</v>

4941
02:04:20.991 --> 02:04:21.561
<v Speaker 1>The skinniest,</v>

4942
02:04:21.561 --> 02:04:26.561
<v Speaker 1>prettiest girls to clean her toes and feet wash cocoa butter on her elbows while</v>

4943
02:04:26.571 --> 02:04:30.530
<v Speaker 1>she talks about her fucking $300 million jet,</v>

4944
02:04:30.531 --> 02:04:32.330
<v Speaker 1>but she's converted into a disco.</v>

4945
02:04:32.390 --> 02:04:33.650
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking nuts.</v>

4946
02:04:33.651 --> 02:04:34.280
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

4947
02:04:34.280 --> 02:04:35.240
<v Speaker 1>Do you think Oprah's game?</v>

4948
02:04:36.020 --> 02:04:36.980
<v Speaker 1>Do I know you?</v>

4949
02:04:37.110 --> 02:04:38.130
<v Speaker 1>You don't really.</v>

4950
02:04:38.310 --> 02:04:39.360
<v Speaker 1>You don't consider it at all?</v>

4951
02:04:39.630 --> 02:04:40.181
<v Speaker 1>That's the room,</v>

4952
02:04:40.181 --> 02:04:40.450
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4953
02:04:40.450 --> 02:04:42.270
<v Speaker 1>He's saying she's gay for that Gail jail.</v>

4954
02:04:42.300 --> 02:04:47.300
<v Speaker 1>I think she's more asexual and just a a power hungry ego maniac.</v>

4955
02:04:48.720 --> 02:04:49.140
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

4956
02:04:49.140 --> 02:04:49.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4957
02:04:49.530 --> 02:04:50.220
<v Speaker 1>totally.</v>

4958
02:04:50.220 --> 02:04:52.470
<v Speaker 1>You don't think she hires chicks would come over and eat or box?</v>

4959
02:04:52.650 --> 02:04:53.483
<v Speaker 1>She Mike.</v>

4960
02:04:53.760 --> 02:04:54.593
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

4961
02:04:54.740 --> 02:04:58.970
<v Speaker 1>She might see the thing that would cause he just tell him yes.</v>

4962
02:05:00.450 --> 02:05:00.810
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

4963
02:05:00.810 --> 02:05:03.510
<v Speaker 1>A girl think so come over and he Oprah's box.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

4965
02:05:04.620 --> 02:05:06.270
<v Speaker 1>I think she probably has a flat rate.</v>

4966
02:05:06.300 --> 02:05:07.440
<v Speaker 1>Like maybe she's like listen,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know you can work at Wendy's does.</v>

4968
02:05:09.510 --> 02:05:10.730
<v Speaker 1>They don't pay much more.</v>

4969
02:05:10.740 --> 02:05:12.200
<v Speaker 1>He can eat my box on 10 days.</v>

4970
02:05:12.810 --> 02:05:13.410
<v Speaker 1>10 G's.</v>

4971
02:05:13.410 --> 02:05:13.710
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

4972
02:05:13.710 --> 02:05:14.850
<v Speaker 1>Thinking about 10 each pop.</v>

4973
02:05:14.900 --> 02:05:15.540
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

4974
02:05:15.540 --> 02:05:17.400
<v Speaker 1>10 g's for a 20 minute session.</v>

4975
02:05:17.430 --> 02:05:17.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4976
02:05:17.970 --> 02:05:18.630
<v Speaker 1>And that girl,</v>

4977
02:05:18.630 --> 02:05:21.150
<v Speaker 1>that's all she does and she just works for Oprah every couple of days.</v>

4978
02:05:21.151 --> 02:05:23.970
<v Speaker 1>But she has like a little thing but she's like I'll give you a little extra if</v>

4979
02:05:23.971 --> 02:05:24.900
<v Speaker 1>you make the pussy pop.</v>

4980
02:05:24.900 --> 02:05:28.380
<v Speaker 1>Like she has like a little tag on it for and the goes like,</v>

4981
02:05:28.381 --> 02:05:28.951
<v Speaker 1>what's that mean?</v>

4982
02:05:28.951 --> 02:05:30.610
<v Speaker 1>Do you go in?</v>

4983
02:05:30.950 --> 02:05:31.980
<v Speaker 1>She calls it a pussy.</v>

4984
02:05:32.350 --> 02:05:33.183
<v Speaker 1>Yeah for sure.</v>

4985
02:05:33.440 --> 02:05:34.273
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4986
02:05:34.630 --> 02:05:38.770
<v Speaker 1>Really you think starts staying box or stag box.</v>

4987
02:05:39.770 --> 02:05:42.990
<v Speaker 1>Cause you know sometimes when she gets like she gets back to her old southern</v>

4988
02:05:42.991 --> 02:05:43.651
<v Speaker 1>route and she'd be like,</v>

4989
02:05:43.651 --> 02:05:44.880
<v Speaker 1>girl you know this shit.</v>

4990
02:05:45.380 --> 02:05:47.310
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't say shit but like this is done.</v>

4991
02:05:47.311 --> 02:05:49.830
<v Speaker 1>Let's just ground like she'll really play it up.</v>

4992
02:05:50.160 --> 02:05:53.760
<v Speaker 1>I think when she's in bed she's probably like get that push to get a guarantee.</v>

4993
02:05:53.761 --> 02:05:58.761
<v Speaker 1>You if you could encapsulate the smell of a Oprah Winfrey post binge diarrhea</v>

4994
02:05:59.431 --> 02:06:00.264
<v Speaker 1>blast,</v>

4995
02:06:00.450 --> 02:06:02.220
<v Speaker 1>cause she knows she must go on a binge.</v>

4996
02:06:02.270 --> 02:06:03.081
<v Speaker 1>She's drops heat,</v>

4997
02:06:03.081 --> 02:06:03.750
<v Speaker 1>she shirts,</v>

4998
02:06:03.750 --> 02:06:05.550
<v Speaker 1>she gets heavy bro and shit goes down.</v>

4999
02:06:05.551 --> 02:06:08.670
<v Speaker 1>She got real skinny for a while and then she just pumps up and there's some meat</v>

5000
02:06:08.671 --> 02:06:09.610
<v Speaker 1>and going on their son.</v>

5001
02:06:09.780 --> 02:06:11.220
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of stress and that's how she,</v>

5002
02:06:11.430 --> 02:06:13.730
<v Speaker 1>if you could encapsulate it into like a,</v>

5003
02:06:13.731 --> 02:06:15.900
<v Speaker 1>a something that you could open and smell her shit,</v>

5004
02:06:16.500 --> 02:06:17.670
<v Speaker 1>I guarantee you people would buy it.</v>

5005
02:06:17.730 --> 02:06:18.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5006
02:06:18.210 --> 02:06:19.050
<v Speaker 1>that'd be fascinated.</v>

5007
02:06:19.051 --> 02:06:19.570
<v Speaker 1>People are,</v>

5008
02:06:19.570 --> 02:06:23.160
<v Speaker 1>I love grape juice for a certain amount of money.</v>

5009
02:06:23.550 --> 02:06:24.151
<v Speaker 1>If you just,</v>

5010
02:06:24.151 --> 02:06:25.470
<v Speaker 1>as long as you made it reasonable,</v>

5011
02:06:25.471 --> 02:06:28.380
<v Speaker 1>if you said smell Oprah shit for $1,</v>

5012
02:06:28.800 --> 02:06:29.970
<v Speaker 1>you would make millions.</v>

5013
02:06:29.971 --> 02:06:30.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5014
02:06:30.660 --> 02:06:31.381
<v Speaker 1>It's all a cost.</v>

5015
02:06:31.381 --> 02:06:32.214
<v Speaker 1>Like a buck.</v>

5016
02:06:32.800 --> 02:06:33.240
<v Speaker 1>That's not,</v>

5017
02:06:33.240 --> 02:06:34.270
<v Speaker 1>that's not reasonable.</v>

5018
02:06:34.280 --> 02:06:36.340
<v Speaker 1>It's less than what we have a car it,</v>

5019
02:06:37.170 --> 02:06:37.891
<v Speaker 1>you might make five,</v>

5020
02:06:37.891 --> 02:06:39.360
<v Speaker 1>6 million bucks off that product.</v>

5021
02:06:39.510 --> 02:06:39.990
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

5022
02:06:39.990 --> 02:06:40.770
<v Speaker 1>Why do we do it?</v>

5023
02:06:40.770 --> 02:06:45.030
<v Speaker 1>Why can't they encapsulate record smells the way they record sound and visual.</v>

5024
02:06:45.031 --> 02:06:47.040
<v Speaker 1>It's just because there's not that much of a demand for it.</v>

5025
02:06:47.430 --> 02:06:49.290
<v Speaker 1>It seems like they should be able to do that by now.</v>

5026
02:06:49.400 --> 02:06:53.820
<v Speaker 1>Like they should be able to put it a smell into some sort of a reusable medium.</v>

5027
02:06:53.820 --> 02:06:54.150
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

5028
02:06:54.150 --> 02:06:55.320
<v Speaker 1>visual medium is like,</v>

5029
02:06:55.321 --> 02:06:56.310
<v Speaker 1>they can record video.</v>

5030
02:06:56.311 --> 02:06:57.300
<v Speaker 1>You can watch that video.</v>

5031
02:06:57.301 --> 02:06:58.350
<v Speaker 1>It gets in through your eyes,</v>

5032
02:06:58.530 --> 02:06:59.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5033
02:06:59.040 --> 02:07:00.330
<v Speaker 1>why can't they record a smell?</v>

5034
02:07:00.440 --> 02:07:01.273
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5035
02:07:01.640 --> 02:07:01.990
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

5036
02:07:01.990 --> 02:07:02.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

5037
02:07:02.250 --> 02:07:04.500
<v Speaker 1>cause you ever done the like the film capsule thing.</v>

5038
02:07:04.501 --> 02:07:05.334
<v Speaker 1>You're doing that before.</v>

5039
02:07:05.340 --> 02:07:08.520
<v Speaker 1>What's that like the 35 millimeter film cart,</v>

5040
02:07:08.521 --> 02:07:09.990
<v Speaker 1>you know the little black thing,</v>

5041
02:07:10.740 --> 02:07:12.780
<v Speaker 1>Fortinet and then you encapsulate it.</v>

5042
02:07:12.810 --> 02:07:13.081
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5043
02:07:13.081 --> 02:07:14.120
<v Speaker 1>You can close it that far.</v>

5044
02:07:14.121 --> 02:07:16.050
<v Speaker 1>It'll stay in their own way.</v>

5045
02:07:16.051 --> 02:07:16.884
<v Speaker 1>Yes it will.</v>

5046
02:07:18.120 --> 02:07:18.331
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

5047
02:07:18.331 --> 02:07:18.660
<v Speaker 1>He will.</v>

5048
02:07:18.660 --> 02:07:19.111
<v Speaker 1>Confident.</v>

5049
02:07:19.111 --> 02:07:22.500
<v Speaker 1>I would bet on him be amended with cups and jars.</v>

5050
02:07:22.510 --> 02:07:23.580
<v Speaker 1>You can do with jars too.</v>

5051
02:07:23.680 --> 02:07:25.520
<v Speaker 1>I've tried to,</v>

5052
02:07:25.700 --> 02:07:27.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5053
02:07:27.300 --> 02:07:28.350
<v Speaker 1>and you also didn't fart.</v>

5054
02:07:28.380 --> 02:07:29.870
<v Speaker 1>Like you got to really be into farting.</v>

5055
02:07:30.190 --> 02:07:34.050
<v Speaker 1>I [inaudible] I farted on Christina the other day when you were there.</v>

5056
02:07:34.051 --> 02:07:34.440
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

5057
02:07:34.440 --> 02:07:35.140
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

5058
02:07:35.140 --> 02:07:35.680
<v Speaker 1>We're all walking,</v>

5059
02:07:35.680 --> 02:07:35.980
<v Speaker 1>hanging out of</v>

5060
02:07:35.980 --> 02:07:38.080
<v Speaker 3>the office and I'd just trailed her whole leg,</v>

5061
02:07:38.081 --> 02:07:38.400
<v Speaker 3>the whole</v>

5062
02:07:38.400 --> 02:07:39.233
<v Speaker 5>damn dude.</v>

5063
02:07:39.330 --> 02:07:41.770
<v Speaker 5>Why don't you find that his wife don't fart on my life.</v>

5064
02:07:41.780 --> 02:07:42.900
<v Speaker 5>So it was respectful,</v>

5065
02:07:42.910 --> 02:07:43.743
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

5066
02:07:44.710 --> 02:07:46.290
<v Speaker 5>My daughter parts on me all the time.</v>

5067
02:07:46.530 --> 02:07:47.720
<v Speaker 5>We were watching TV shows with her.</v>

5068
02:07:47.721 --> 02:07:49.440
<v Speaker 5>She's sitting on my lap and she just starts farting.</v>

5069
02:07:49.830 --> 02:07:51.450
<v Speaker 5>Three year olds don't give a fuck,</v>

5070
02:07:51.480 --> 02:07:52.313
<v Speaker 5>but you just go.</v>

5071
02:07:52.480 --> 02:07:53.550
<v Speaker 5>It's just foreign to me.</v>

5072
02:07:53.551 --> 02:07:53.851
<v Speaker 5>She goes,</v>

5073
02:07:53.851 --> 02:07:54.750

5075
02:07:57.060 --> 02:07:59.670
<v Speaker 5>That's gotta be the only time that doesn't bother you.</v>

5076
02:08:00.390 --> 02:08:01.410
<v Speaker 5>If your daughter,</v>

5077
02:08:01.411 --> 02:08:01.690

02:08:03.450 --> 02:08:06.870
<v Speaker 5>You know I gotta I gotta wipe her but still make sure it's done right.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Flush.</v>

5082
02:08:07.850 --> 02:08:09.030
<v Speaker 5>Flush your logs.</v>

5083
02:08:09.300 --> 02:08:10.680
<v Speaker 5>If a baby's log,</v>

5084
02:08:10.681 --> 02:08:11.610
<v Speaker 5>a three year old baby,</v>

5085
02:08:11.760 --> 02:08:13.860
<v Speaker 5>if the your log was in proportionate,</v>

5086
02:08:13.861 --> 02:08:16.020
<v Speaker 5>it would be the size of your fucking thigh.</v>

5087
02:08:16.470 --> 02:08:16.771
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

5093
02:08:23.670 --> 02:08:26.020

5094
02:08:26.040 --> 02:08:27.420
<v Speaker 5>like a grown up shit.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

5096

02:09:52.491 --> 02:09:53.730
<v Speaker 3>and I even said it just a,</v>

5149
02:09:53.840 --> 02:09:54.050
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

5150
02:09:54.050 --> 02:09:55.490
<v Speaker 3>last week on the podcast,</v>

5151
02:09:55.491 --> 02:09:57.470
<v Speaker 3>but I sit on one of your old old podcasts.</v>

5152
02:09:57.620 --> 02:10:01.070
<v Speaker 3>I can't remember that I had this idea that called snail mail.</v>

5153
02:10:01.250 --> 02:10:03.240
<v Speaker 3>And where I thought about when,</v>

5154
02:10:03.241 --> 02:10:05.270
<v Speaker 3>when my grandmother was still alive that she doesn't get,</v>

5155
02:10:05.271 --> 02:10:06.170
<v Speaker 3>have a computer,</v>

5156
02:10:06.200 --> 02:10:09.740
<v Speaker 3>but I wanted to be able to like write an email and then send it to a company and</v>

5157
02:10:09.741 --> 02:10:12.920
<v Speaker 3>that company would write it out and send her like a handwritten letter,</v>

5158
02:10:13.070 --> 02:10:13.251
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

5159
02:10:13.251 --> 02:10:17.810
<v Speaker 3>So it'd be easy for me to write letters to my grandmother for a charge the other</v>

5160
02:10:17.810 --> 02:10:17.811
<v Speaker 3>day.</v>

5161
02:10:17.811 --> 02:10:21.980
<v Speaker 3>I had a Freddy Lockhart podcast and I talked about it and then two yesterday,</v>

5162
02:10:22.130 --> 02:10:27.130
<v Speaker 3>gizmodo.com said this like artists guy did that and he's called snail mail to</v>

5163
02:10:27.680 --> 02:10:32.660
<v Speaker 3>email or email to snail mail.com or something like that and that's what this new</v>

5164
02:10:32.661 --> 02:10:33.710
<v Speaker 3>company gone.</v>

5165
02:10:34.040 --> 02:10:34.491
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

5166
02:10:34.491 --> 02:10:35.750
<v Speaker 1>if they stole from you,</v>

5167
02:10:35.751 --> 02:10:38.120
<v Speaker 1>I hope the fucking day crashed to the ground.</v>

5168
02:10:38.121 --> 02:10:39.980
<v Speaker 1>Bryan's guess not cool man.</v>

5169
02:10:40.010 --> 02:10:41.450
<v Speaker 1>That's not cool at all.</v>

5170
02:10:41.480 --> 02:10:42.380
<v Speaker 1>How long have they been around?</v>

5171
02:10:42.650 --> 02:10:43.850
<v Speaker 1>I think since yesterday.</v>

5172
02:10:43.851 --> 02:10:45.230
<v Speaker 1>And you allow them to steal it from you.</v>

5173
02:10:45.231 --> 02:10:46.090
<v Speaker 1>You don't want a piece of that.</v>

5174
02:10:46.100 --> 02:10:46.530
<v Speaker 1>There's no money.</v>

5175
02:10:46.530 --> 02:10:49.550
<v Speaker 1>He's doing it for free so it's like more of an art project.</v>

5176
02:10:49.560 --> 02:10:51.320
<v Speaker 1>I think those guys for your idea,</v>

5177
02:10:51.321 --> 02:10:52.220
<v Speaker 1>you welcome it.</v>

5178
02:10:52.250 --> 02:10:53.083
<v Speaker 1>You have your hand.</v>

5179
02:10:53.300 --> 02:10:53.511
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

5180
02:10:53.511 --> 02:10:53.751
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

5181
02:10:53.751 --> 02:10:54.584
<v Speaker 1>That's nice.</v>

5182
02:10:54.650 --> 02:10:55.470
<v Speaker 1>That's very thoughtful of it.</v>

5183
02:10:55.470 --> 02:10:56.330
<v Speaker 1>It's nice you're,</v>

5184
02:10:56.331 --> 02:10:57.920
<v Speaker 1>you're contributing to the world,</v>

5185
02:10:57.980 --> 02:10:58.370
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

5186
02:10:58.370 --> 02:10:59.420
<v Speaker 1>You little wacky ideas.</v>

5187
02:10:59.580 --> 02:11:00.231
<v Speaker 1>I've had time.</v>

5188
02:11:00.231 --> 02:11:01.160
<v Speaker 1>I would have done it myself.</v>

5189
02:11:01.340 --> 02:11:03.780
<v Speaker 1>If you don't know a and you can't get enough of Brian,</v>

5190
02:11:03.810 --> 02:11:04.041
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

5191
02:11:04.041 --> 02:11:04.341
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

5192
02:11:04.341 --> 02:11:06.000
<v Speaker 1>who's that dude stumbling through a sentences?</v>

5193
02:11:06.020 --> 02:11:06.920
<v Speaker 1>I fucking love him.</v>

5194
02:11:07.070 --> 02:11:07.600
<v Speaker 1>His stone.</v>

5195
02:11:07.600 --> 02:11:08.060
<v Speaker 1>You can.</v>

5196
02:11:08.060 --> 02:11:08.271
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5197
02:11:08.271 --> 02:11:08.931
<v Speaker 1>he has two stone.</v>

5198
02:11:08.931 --> 02:11:11.330
<v Speaker 1>Brian is a way smoother talker before he does the podcast,</v>

5199
02:11:11.331 --> 02:11:16.331
<v Speaker 1>but I knew that I was going to get past that third hit his way and he's</v>

5200
02:11:16.761 --> 02:11:17.330
<v Speaker 1>impulsive.</v>

5201
02:11:17.330 --> 02:11:19.520
<v Speaker 1>He's gonna say yes and I know he shouldn't have it,</v>

5202
02:11:19.670 --> 02:11:22.210
<v Speaker 1>but part of me wants to see him take you to give me a third head,</v>

5203
02:11:22.640 --> 02:11:24.280
<v Speaker 1>gave you that third hand realize no,</v>

5204
02:11:24.290 --> 02:11:25.280
<v Speaker 1>I took the third hit too.</v>

5205
02:11:25.340 --> 02:11:26.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm just starting to come back.</v>

5206
02:11:26.540 --> 02:11:28.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm on a Machu Picchu high.</v>

5207
02:11:28.480 --> 02:11:31.010
<v Speaker 1>The entire time we were talking I was thinking about Machu Picchu.</v>

5208
02:11:32.840 --> 02:11:33.561
<v Speaker 1>Plan your trip,</v>

5209
02:11:33.561 --> 02:11:33.891
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

5210
02:11:33.891 --> 02:11:34.724
<v Speaker 1>You plan your trip.</v>

5211
02:11:34.820 --> 02:11:35.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5212
02:11:35.550 --> 02:11:35.961
<v Speaker 1>That's hard.</v>

5213
02:11:35.961 --> 02:11:36.820
<v Speaker 1>When you have little ones,</v>

5214
02:11:36.880 --> 02:11:37.850
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they'd be down.</v>

5215
02:11:38.480 --> 02:11:41.390
<v Speaker 1>I got to tell him Mickey mouse is at the top as what I'll do.</v>

5216
02:11:41.570 --> 02:11:42.440
<v Speaker 1>I'll hire some dudes,</v>

5217
02:11:42.441 --> 02:11:45.830
<v Speaker 1>dress like Mickey and Donald and there'll be waiting for me at the top of my</v>

5218
02:11:45.831 --> 02:11:46.664
<v Speaker 1>jewelry shoes</v>

5219
02:11:50.380 --> 02:11:51.111
<v Speaker 1>and the kids would like,</v>

5220
02:11:51.111 --> 02:11:51.471
<v Speaker 1>Daddy,</v>

5221
02:11:51.471 --> 02:11:52.071
<v Speaker 1>let's go back.</v>

5222
02:11:52.071 --> 02:11:52.904
<v Speaker 1>I can't breathe.</v>

5223
02:11:54.200 --> 02:11:56.960
<v Speaker 1>It's not the ideal place for little kids to see the big rocks.</v>

5224
02:11:56.961 --> 02:11:58.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm here for the big rocks.</v>

5225
02:11:58.161 --> 02:11:58.621
<v Speaker 1>You're fucks.</v>

5226
02:11:58.621 --> 02:12:00.770
<v Speaker 1>You don't let your kids have lemonade stands.</v>

5227
02:12:00.771 --> 02:12:03.530
<v Speaker 1>I saw lemonade stand the other day and it blew my mind.</v>

5228
02:12:03.531 --> 02:12:03.771
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

5229
02:12:03.771 --> 02:12:04.400
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

5230
02:12:04.400 --> 02:12:05.233
<v Speaker 1>you gotta be parents?</v>

5231
02:12:05.470 --> 02:12:10.040
<v Speaker 1>These kids on the side of a street and that's an open item shopping.</v>

5232
02:12:10.041 --> 02:12:10.874
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5233
02:12:11.390 --> 02:12:12.171
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck is that?</v>

5234
02:12:12.171 --> 02:12:13.140
<v Speaker 1>And there was no parents anywhere.</v>

5235
02:12:13.150 --> 02:12:14.420
<v Speaker 1>Where about after to the house?</v>

5236
02:12:14.421 --> 02:12:15.254
<v Speaker 1>The poor guy</v>

5237
02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:17.380
<v Speaker 6>and in Brooklyn.</v>

5238
02:12:17.410 --> 02:12:18.041
<v Speaker 6>Did you hear about this?</v>

5239
02:12:18.041 --> 02:12:18.371
<v Speaker 6>Where the,</v>

5240
02:12:18.371 --> 02:12:20.290
<v Speaker 6>the little kid asks for directions.</v>

5241
02:12:20.291 --> 02:12:21.670
<v Speaker 6>He's on his way home from school.</v>

5242
02:12:21.671 --> 02:12:22.480
<v Speaker 6>He's eight years old,</v>

5243
02:12:22.480 --> 02:12:26.560
<v Speaker 6>asked for directions they can't find them and they find video of the kid at the</v>

5244
02:12:26.561 --> 02:12:29.110
<v Speaker 6>playground talking to some man that go to the man's house.</v>

5245
02:12:29.111 --> 02:12:31.630
<v Speaker 6>The kids chopped up in his frigerator file.</v>

5246
02:12:31.690 --> 02:12:32.200
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>

5247
02:12:32.200 --> 02:12:34.210
<v Speaker 6>Yeah cause an orthodox Jew too,</v>

5248
02:12:34.240 --> 02:12:37.480
<v Speaker 6>which really shocked the Jewish community because the other kid was a Hasidic</v>

5249
02:12:37.480 --> 02:12:38.100
<v Speaker 6>Jew and it's you,</v>

5250
02:12:38.100 --> 02:12:39.680
<v Speaker 6>a very tight knit Jewish community.</v>

5251
02:12:39.700 --> 02:12:40.000
<v Speaker 6>There's,</v>

5252
02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:41.950
<v Speaker 6>this guy was an orthodox Jew,</v>

5253
02:12:42.010 --> 02:12:43.600
<v Speaker 6>killed this fucking kid and chopped him up.</v>

5254
02:12:43.601 --> 02:12:44.620
<v Speaker 6>And I did think it was like,</v>

5255
02:12:44.621 --> 02:12:45.221
<v Speaker 6>it was weird.</v>

5256
02:12:45.221 --> 02:12:45.761
<v Speaker 6>Like yesterday,</v>

5257
02:12:45.761 --> 02:12:50.761
<v Speaker 6>I'm driving down like Glendale Boulevard and it's like sundown and you see like</v>

5258
02:12:52.070 --> 02:12:54.100
<v Speaker 6>a saw two girls that were probably like,</v>

5259
02:12:54.700 --> 02:12:55.121
<v Speaker 6>I dunno,</v>

5260
02:12:55.121 --> 02:12:59.830
<v Speaker 6>maybe like 1213 just walking down the street and it's not like a bad</v>

5261
02:12:59.831 --> 02:13:00.664
<v Speaker 6>neighborhood.</v>

5262
02:13:00.770 --> 02:13:01.330
<v Speaker 6>And you're like,</v>

5263
02:13:01.330 --> 02:13:03.190
<v Speaker 6>you shouldn't be walking down in Glendale Boulevard.</v>

5264
02:13:03.250 --> 02:13:04.090
<v Speaker 6>Like you're too young.</v>

5265
02:13:04.091 --> 02:13:04.840
<v Speaker 6>Like they,</v>

5266
02:13:04.840 --> 02:13:07.200
<v Speaker 6>like cars are flying by and there's,</v>

5267
02:13:07.220 --> 02:13:07.620
<v Speaker 6>there's,</v>

5268
02:13:07.620 --> 02:13:07.860
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

5269
02:13:07.860 --> 02:13:08.501
<v Speaker 6>it's still la.</v>

5270
02:13:08.501 --> 02:13:10.510
<v Speaker 6>There's Weirdos on any street.</v>

5271
02:13:10.511 --> 02:13:11.410
<v Speaker 6>Just walking around.</v>

5272
02:13:11.650 --> 02:13:12.610
<v Speaker 6>It does make me go like,</v>

5273
02:13:12.611 --> 02:13:12.850
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>

5274
02:13:12.850 --> 02:13:13.601
<v Speaker 6>I thought like,</v>

5275
02:13:13.601 --> 02:13:16.180
<v Speaker 6>I would definitely not be cool with my kid walking around.</v>

5276
02:13:16.810 --> 02:13:17.051
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

5277
02:13:17.051 --> 02:13:19.390
<v Speaker 6>you live well just like that street.</v>

5278
02:13:19.391 --> 02:13:20.020
<v Speaker 6>Like it's not a,</v>

5279
02:13:20.020 --> 02:13:20.381
<v Speaker 6>it's not,</v>

5280
02:13:20.381 --> 02:13:20.831
<v Speaker 6>that wasn't like,</v>

5281
02:13:20.831 --> 02:13:22.330
<v Speaker 6>it's not a residential street man.</v>

5282
02:13:22.331 --> 02:13:22.970
<v Speaker 6>Like it's,</v>

5283
02:13:22.970 --> 02:13:23.271
<v Speaker 6>it's a,</v>

5284
02:13:23.271 --> 02:13:24.610
<v Speaker 6>it's like a highway almost.</v>

5285
02:13:24.630 --> 02:13:26.980
<v Speaker 6>It's why people always want to go to the suburbs once they have children.</v>

5286
02:13:27.300 --> 02:13:27.581
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>

5287
02:13:27.581 --> 02:13:27.791
<v Speaker 6>wow,</v>

5288
02:13:27.791 --> 02:13:28.381

<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

5291
02:13:29.800 --> 02:13:32.160
<v Speaker 6>I sort of admire people that raise their kids in New York</v>

5292
02:13:32.160 --> 02:13:32.421
<v Speaker 5>City.</v>

5293
02:13:32.421 --> 02:13:32.641
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

5294
02:13:32.641 --> 02:13:33.150

5296
02:13:35.460 --> 02:13:35.831
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5297
02:13:35.831 --> 02:13:39.630
<v Speaker 5>to grow up in the hub of North American civilization.</v>

5298
02:13:39.660 --> 02:13:39.960
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

5299
02:13:39.960 --> 02:13:42.060
<v Speaker 5>I mean New York City is unlike any other city.</v>

5300
02:13:42.061 --> 02:13:45.240
<v Speaker 5>You can call all a la a city all you want,</v>

5301
02:13:45.241 --> 02:13:46.350
<v Speaker 5>but it's really not.</v>

5302
02:13:46.590 --> 02:13:46.951
<v Speaker 5>It's a,</v>

5303
02:13:46.951 --> 02:13:50.100
<v Speaker 5>it's a destination to destination.</v>

5304
02:13:50.150 --> 02:13:50.420
<v Speaker 5>It is.</v>

5305
02:13:50.420 --> 02:13:51.360

<v Speaker 5>it's a place,</v>

5307
02:13:52.081 --> 02:13:52.950
<v Speaker 5>but it's not a city.</v>

5308
02:13:53.160 --> 02:13:55.680
<v Speaker 5>New York City is a fucking city man.</v>

5309
02:13:55.830 --> 02:13:59.400
<v Speaker 5>When you're in staying in a hotel and you open your window and everywhere around</v>

5312
02:14:04.060 --> 02:14:06.870
<v Speaker 5>there's fucking millions of people looking out their windows and looking at you</v>

5313
02:14:06.871 --> 02:14:11.871
<v Speaker 5>and you see this giant thing that's created and on this little island that's a</v>

5314
02:14:12.001 --> 02:14:14.070
<v Speaker 5>fucking city and others,</v>

5315

5317
02:14:24.180 --> 02:14:24.481
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5318
02:14:24.481 --> 02:14:27.630
<v Speaker 5>they don't have any room to go east and West so they go north and south.</v>

5319
02:14:27.630 --> 02:14:29.580
<v Speaker 5>You know what the fuck.</v>

5320
02:14:29.581 --> 02:14:33.930
<v Speaker 5>That's a weird place to all east coast cities have that a different vibe and</v>

5323
02:14:39.901 --> 02:14:42.390

02:14:46.590 --> 02:14:48.360
<v Speaker 5>you can feel the city is alive here.</v>

5335
02:14:55.300 --> 02:14:57.270
<v Speaker 5>so the vibe of the city's all fucked up.</v>
