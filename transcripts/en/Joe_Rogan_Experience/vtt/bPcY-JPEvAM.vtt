<v Speaker 3>the way we thought of it as we're in</v>

16
00:00:45.591 --> 00:00:46.490
<v Speaker 3>Newport,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rhode Island,</v>

17
00:00:46.491 --> 00:00:50.120
<v Speaker 3>we learned about this rich couple who</v>
<v Speaker 3>went on a 10 year honeymoon and then</v>

18
00:00:50.121 --> 00:00:54.170
<v Speaker 3>they came back with four kids and I just</v>
<v Speaker 3>thought that sounded so romantic to be</v>

19
00:00:54.171 --> 00:00:56.750
<v Speaker 3>so rich that you dislike.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Went away for a decade.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Like they don't even know their doctor.</v>

24
00:01:04.711 --> 00:01:08.010
<v Speaker 2>They're in fucking Sweden.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are rich people.</v>

25
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.460
<v Speaker 2>Those people were so richmond.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know about the newport that the</v>

26
00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.040
<v Speaker 2>seat of wealth?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was newport,</v>

27
00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.940
<v Speaker 2>Rhode Island.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

28
00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.420
<v Speaker 2>I used to do a lot of gigs in Rhode</v>
<v Speaker 2>Island.</v>

29
00:01:15.421 --> 00:01:18.560
<v Speaker 2>There's Caesar's insane mansions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're the in the,</v>

30
00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.590
<v Speaker 3>well in the gilded age,</v>
<v Speaker 3>1900.</v>

31
00:01:21.591 --> 00:01:25.250
<v Speaker 3>Basically 90 percent of the wealth in</v>
<v Speaker 3>America was in Rhode Island and then</v>

32
00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:28.310
<v Speaker 3>everyone else was living in squalor.</v>

33
00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.860
<v Speaker 2>They hadn't established personal income</v>
<v Speaker 2>tax yet.</v>

34
00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.270
<v Speaker 2>It was like the years right before</v>
<v Speaker 2>personal income tax had been established</v>

35
00:01:36.271 --> 00:01:37.010
<v Speaker 2>in this country.</v>

36
00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:42.010
<v Speaker 3>So people had like 35 indoor servants,</v>
<v Speaker 3>55 outdoor servants like you could.</v>

37
00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:46.500
<v Speaker 3>People would come from Australia and</v>
<v Speaker 3>boats and you would just make them your.</v>

38
00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:47.810
<v Speaker 3>It was like slavery,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but</v>

39
00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.480
<v Speaker 2>the show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the endless listen to mature.</v>

40
00:01:50.481 --> 00:01:54.760
<v Speaker 2>We do an extended lecture on personal</v>
<v Speaker 2>income tax and the history and slavery.</v>

41
00:01:54.761 --> 00:01:55.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

42
00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.650
<v Speaker 2>Nice.</v>

43
00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.440
<v Speaker 3>So another period is based on that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how we know about it,</v>

44
00:01:58.470 --> 00:01:59.880
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were like these people.</v>

45
00:01:59.881 --> 00:02:03.360
<v Speaker 2>It was the carnegies and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>rockefellers and these like seat of</v>

46
00:02:03.361 --> 00:02:04.980
<v Speaker 2>power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Illuminati old.</v>

47
00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:08.020
<v Speaker 3>You had a billion dollars a hundred</v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago.</v>

48
00:02:08.021 --> 00:02:11.140
<v Speaker 3>Like these people or they were just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But now we've come full circle and</v>

49
00:02:11.141 --> 00:02:14.930
<v Speaker 3>people have figured out how to legally</v>
<v Speaker 3>steal money and not paying income tax.</v>

50
00:02:14.931 --> 00:02:18.440
<v Speaker 3>So but not that many.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the other thing,</v>

51
00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:20.950
<v Speaker 3>but don't like the Romney's of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

52
00:02:20.951 --> 00:02:23.500
<v Speaker 3>Don't they know how to not pay or are</v>
<v Speaker 3>you talking about?</v>

53
00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.280
<v Speaker 3>Well like the like politicians don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They kind of know how to.</v>

54
00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.760
<v Speaker 2>You're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's talking about big old corporate</v>

55
00:02:29.761 --> 00:02:34.260
<v Speaker 2>oligarchy billionaire people figured out</v>
<v Speaker 2>any super rich people are going to try</v>

56
00:02:34.261 --> 00:02:38.130
<v Speaker 2>really hard to hold onto their money and</v>
<v Speaker 2>pay as little taxes as possible and form</v>

57
00:02:38.131 --> 00:02:40.500
<v Speaker 2>llcs and corporations that don't kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>jazz.</v>

58
00:02:40.501 --> 00:02:43.140
<v Speaker 2>But it is funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The comedians are like mostly super</v>

59
00:02:43.141 --> 00:02:45.780
<v Speaker 2>liberal and they were all like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

60
00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.070
<v Speaker 2>we got Bernie and we gotta like pay</v>
<v Speaker 2>these high tax rates and anyway I'm</v>

61
00:02:50.071 --> 00:02:53.850
<v Speaker 2>incorporated on my llc name is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sounds like you're doing a corporate</v>

62
00:02:53.851 --> 00:02:56.090
<v Speaker 2>fiction too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Differ</v>

63
00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.440
<v Speaker 3>for entertainers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but here's the problem.</v>

64
00:02:58.441 --> 00:03:00.130
<v Speaker 3>Like where's the going?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I'd</v>

65
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.090
<v Speaker 2>be willing to give away more money and</v>
<v Speaker 2>tax dollars if I knew that it was a rock</v>

66
00:03:04.091 --> 00:03:06.280
<v Speaker 2>solid establishment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They really knew what to do.</v>

67
00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.090
<v Speaker 2>And if you could pick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you could tick like little feel,</v>

68
00:03:09.091 --> 00:03:09.911
<v Speaker 2>a little bubbles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

69
00:03:09.911 --> 00:03:11.200
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like most of my money to go to</v>

70
00:03:11.201 --> 00:03:12.430
<v Speaker 2>education.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

71
00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:14.080
<v Speaker 2>nothing to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing to that.</v>

72
00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:15.650
<v Speaker 2>That'd be amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would be.</v>

73
00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.450
<v Speaker 2>But the country be fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

74
00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:20.920
<v Speaker 2>The roads to fall apart quicker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything would fall apart.</v>

75
00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:22.690
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cops would be out of business.</v>

76
00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.420
<v Speaker 2>Well no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because half of the country at least</v>

77
00:03:25.421 --> 00:03:26.980
<v Speaker 2>would be like all my money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The cops,</v>

78
00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.040
<v Speaker 2>all my mother did defense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would love to see.</v>

79
00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:31.171
<v Speaker 2>I would love to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

80
00:03:31.171 --> 00:03:34.360
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't love to do it because I just</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't think that that amount of power</v>

81
00:03:34.361 --> 00:03:36.730
<v Speaker 2>should be in people's hands without a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of research first.</v>

82
00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.340
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's big part of the problem.</v>

83
00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.880
<v Speaker 2>Even running for president and voting</v>
<v Speaker 2>for president,</v>

84
00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.750
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to have any research done</v>
<v Speaker 2>before you choose a candidate.</v>

85
00:03:46.751 --> 00:03:48.970
<v Speaker 2>You just like them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And also you don't have to have done any</v>

86
00:03:48.971 --> 00:03:50.710
<v Speaker 2>research to be the president.</v>

87
00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.910
<v Speaker 2>I guess I'm a hillary person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

88
00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:57.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can become a hillary person just</v>

89
00:03:57.911 --> 00:04:01.480
<v Speaker 2>because you didn't want to reality show</v>
<v Speaker 2>contestant or whatever the fuck you was.</v>

90
00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:02.890
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the crazy thing about,</v>

91
00:04:02.891 --> 00:04:03.880
<v Speaker 2>and I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do think,</v>

92
00:04:03.881 --> 00:04:05.020
<v Speaker 2>I think we're talking about this last</v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

93
00:04:05.021 --> 00:04:09.160
<v Speaker 2>I do think trump,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if he's doing anything good for American</v>

94
00:04:09.161 --> 00:04:12.340
<v Speaker 2>society,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's pointing out how ridiculous and</v>

95
00:04:12.341 --> 00:04:14.830
<v Speaker 2>arbitrary the worship of the American</v>
<v Speaker 2>president is.</v>

96
00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.590
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not presidential.</v>

97
00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:21.970
<v Speaker 2>Presidential means that you look</v>
<v Speaker 2>dignified while you bomb a village in</v>

98
00:04:21.971 --> 00:04:24.100
<v Speaker 2>Yemen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we should just destroy</v>

99
00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.030
<v Speaker 2>presidential.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As an idea of adult said that he called</v>

100
00:04:28.031 --> 00:04:32.530
<v Speaker 2>it the uniquely American religion of</v>
<v Speaker 2>President Worship President worship.</v>

101
00:04:32.531 --> 00:04:33.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is really.</v>

102
00:04:33.641 --> 00:04:36.440
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's really just a new version of</v>
<v Speaker 2>King's.</v>

103
00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.800
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's so funny that our whole</v>

104
00:04:38.801 --> 00:04:42.610
<v Speaker 2>foundation mythology is based on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>rejection of the king and we immediately</v>

105
00:04:42.611 --> 00:04:45.690
<v Speaker 2>established king kingship,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is what they did in.</v>

106
00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:48.220
<v Speaker 2>In Christianity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think of Christianity this way,</v>

107
00:04:48.221 --> 00:04:51.190
<v Speaker 2>like it's based in this Judaic religion</v>
<v Speaker 2>that says,</v>

108
00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:56.200
<v Speaker 2>let's get rid of the idea of a man that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you worship or a figure or a God that</v>

109
00:04:56.201 --> 00:04:58.330
<v Speaker 2>you bow in front of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's one right in front of us,</v>

110
00:04:58.331 --> 00:05:00.430
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's get rid of a statue that you bow</v>

111
00:05:00.431 --> 00:05:03.460
<v Speaker 2>down in front of and the next religion</v>
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>

112
00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:05.650
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's watch a human being like,</v>

113
00:05:05.651 --> 00:05:07.840
<v Speaker 2>it's so weird that it's so in us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

114
00:05:07.841 --> 00:05:12.160
<v Speaker 2>it's Alpha male chimpanzee stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We always try to look to the number one</v>

115
00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:13.760
<v Speaker 2>though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the one that knows the most,</v>

116
00:05:13.761 --> 00:05:17.380
<v Speaker 2>the oldest with the most scars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's gone to the battle as the most</v>

117
00:05:17.381 --> 00:05:21.490
<v Speaker 2>wisdom lead us because you want to know</v>
<v Speaker 2>which snakes are poisonous and what</v>

118
00:05:21.491 --> 00:05:23.410
<v Speaker 2>plants you can eat and what's going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>kill you.</v>

119
00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:24.383
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And and,</v>

120
00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.840
<v Speaker 2>and everybody worships the past.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what's so funny to me about an</v>

121
00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:29.950
<v Speaker 2>American.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the day after July fourth and</v>

122
00:05:29.951 --> 00:05:31.930
<v Speaker 2>everybody talks about the founding</v>
<v Speaker 2>fathers is like,</v>

123
00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:34.770
<v Speaker 2>those were dudes who had the education</v>
<v Speaker 2>of it.</v>

124
00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:37.840
<v Speaker 2>There were brilliant people in the 18</v>
<v Speaker 2>hundreds and 17 hundreds,</v>

125
00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:41.260
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not like trying to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not trying to go to a doctor from</v>

126
00:05:41.261 --> 00:05:45.130
<v Speaker 2>the founding fathers days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

127
00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:50.290
<v Speaker 2>People price dunk people probably did</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably stank.</v>

128
00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:52.780
<v Speaker 2>It probably just would let people</v>
<v Speaker 2>smelled like back then,</v>

129
00:05:52.781 --> 00:05:55.330
<v Speaker 2>like if you call it a gal after a bath,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were psyched.</v>

130
00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:00.910
<v Speaker 2>Bath is that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's be honest about what a bath is.</v>

131
00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:05.920
<v Speaker 2>It's asshole and vagina soup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're sitting in a big teapot,</v>

132
00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:11.690
<v Speaker 2>but you don't buy your balls in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just the vessels in women put their</v>

133
00:06:11.691 --> 00:06:13.700
<v Speaker 2>vaginas in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Men they have.</v>

134
00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:15.650
<v Speaker 2>They hold up their assholes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their dicks and balls,</v>

135
00:06:15.651 --> 00:06:19.010
<v Speaker 2>so they don't concern me what a guy</v>
<v Speaker 2>smells like,</v>

136
00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:21.410
<v Speaker 2>but what a girl smells like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>concerns me,</v>

137
00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:24.050
<v Speaker 2>but maybe it wouldn't have back then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it wouldn't have.</v>

138
00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:25.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe just your standards change.</v>

139
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:26.781
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're horny enough,</v>

140
00:06:26.781 --> 00:06:27.860
<v Speaker 2>you don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is true.</v>

141
00:06:27.861 --> 00:06:31.520
<v Speaker 2>I'll never forget this passage</v>
<v Speaker 2>always,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Fucking your wife.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

188
00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:33.880
<v Speaker 3>I mean when you're that famous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your work ethic,</v>

189
00:08:33.881 --> 00:08:38.050
<v Speaker 3>it's like you just devote everything to</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I think because like I have my,</v>

190
00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:41.470
<v Speaker 3>my agents were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they know that the agents who are Tom</v>

191
00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:43.240
<v Speaker 3>Cruise agents,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they said Tom Cruise always gets back</v>

192
00:08:43.241 --> 00:08:46.660
<v Speaker 3>within an hour when we send a script</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I'll like keep a script for like</v>

193
00:08:46.661 --> 00:08:48.250
<v Speaker 3>three weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then by the time I read it,</v>

194
00:08:48.251 --> 00:08:51.850
<v Speaker 3>the parts we can cast</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tom Cruise,</v>

195
00:08:51.851 --> 00:08:55.120
<v Speaker 3>we'll read a script and an hour and get</v>
<v Speaker 3>back to them and either like it or not</v>

196
00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:56.040
<v Speaker 3>it like he's</v>

197
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:58.030
<v Speaker 2>just like on the ball,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

198
00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:00.120
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's trying to win,</v>

199
00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:01.600
<v Speaker 2>he's won.</v>

200
00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:06.600
<v Speaker 4>It's an inhuman instinct because our</v>
<v Speaker 4>human instinct is to just atrophy in a</v>

201
00:09:07.691 --> 00:09:09.700
<v Speaker 4>way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean you have to kind of fight it,</v>

202
00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:12.340
<v Speaker 4>but easy to be lazy and to</v>
<v Speaker 4>procrastinate.</v>

203
00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:15.180
<v Speaker 2>It's definitely easy to be lazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not if you're going to be Tom</v>

204
00:09:15.181 --> 00:09:17.730
<v Speaker 2>cruise or really have to be on the ball,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no other way.</v>

205
00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:19.470
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't know time job.</v>

206
00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:21.380
<v Speaker 2>That's not just what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And those,</v>

207
00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:25.590
<v Speaker 2>there's some weird alien sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>behavior patterns that we don't</v>

208
00:09:25.591 --> 00:09:28.050
<v Speaker 2>recognize as being normal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when he jumped up on Oprah's couch</v>

209
00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:29.311
<v Speaker 2>is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in love,</v>

210
00:09:29.311 --> 00:09:30.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm in love him and love.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And everyone's like,</v>

211
00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:33.730
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck is going on here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right Person?</v>

212
00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:35.010
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like a person who doesn't</v>

213
00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:38.100
<v Speaker 2>understand French,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're speaking French to a French</v>

214
00:09:38.101 --> 00:09:40.400
<v Speaker 2>person who's saying all the right words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

215
00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:43.860
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck is wrong with this guy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems like every choice he makes</v>

216
00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:48.600
<v Speaker 2>outside of acting is based on what he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>assuming normal human beings think is</v>

217
00:09:48.601 --> 00:09:52.020
<v Speaker 2>the normal behavior because the love is</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you jump on a couch and go,</v>

218
00:09:52.021 --> 00:09:52.920
<v Speaker 2>I love her.</v>

219
00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:55.710
<v Speaker 2>Which is informed by movies really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

220
00:09:55.711 --> 00:09:57.450
<v Speaker 2>Like that's more movie like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

221
00:09:57.451 --> 00:09:59.610
<v Speaker 2>That's like John Cusak and say anything</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

222
00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:00.840
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what love looks like.</v>

223
00:10:00.841 --> 00:10:01.980
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>

233
00:10:26.191 --> 00:10:28.470
<v Speaker 2>all time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wish you would just come clean with</v>

234
00:10:28.471 --> 00:10:32.010
<v Speaker 2>like one day just to sit down and just</v>
<v Speaker 2>be like,</v>

235
00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:35.700
<v Speaker 2>given some ecstasy and have them just</v>
<v Speaker 2>talk about who he is.</v>

236
00:10:35.701 --> 00:10:40.140
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't even know the fuck I am and</v>
<v Speaker 2>now I've been scientology for so long.</v>

237
00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:44.850
<v Speaker 2>Like 13 guys last year was worried.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to tell.</v>

238
00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:48.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm always worried.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to tell you.</v>

239
00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:51.180
<v Speaker 2>He did Chris Hardwick's podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

240
00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:52.840
<v Speaker 2>He did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He did a one on one interview.</v>

241
00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:57.420
<v Speaker 2>I listened to it recently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wish you could get them on here</v>

<v Speaker 2>you get in.</v>

244
00:10:59.371 --> 00:11:01.860
<v Speaker 2>But I don't think you could pierce that</v>
<v Speaker 2>impenetrable layer.</v>

245
00:11:01.861 --> 00:11:04.590
<v Speaker 2>I think he be fake with you to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if he's fake,</v>

246
00:11:04.591 --> 00:11:06.360
<v Speaker 2>you find out if he's fake to find some</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

<v Speaker 2>he is.</v>

253
00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:18.360
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

<v Speaker 2>just no different.</v>

257
00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:31.710
<v Speaker 2>Biggest movie star couldn't pick three</v>
<v Speaker 2>movies that have inspired because he</v>

258
00:11:31.711 --> 00:11:32.970
<v Speaker 2>didn't want them to like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

259
00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:35.370
<v Speaker 2>a Spielberg,</v>

260
00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:38.360

<v Speaker 2>Scorsese and you know,</v>

261
00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:40.050
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all a construct.</v>

262
00:11:40.170 --> 00:11:41.550
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to meet him.</v>

263
00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:43.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe he did Chris's.</v>

264
00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:45.570
<v Speaker 2>That's so cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should have them on the show.</v>

265
00:11:45.571 --> 00:11:46.830
<v Speaker 2>You could get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I got.</v>

266
00:11:46.831 --> 00:11:47.850
<v Speaker 2>I got faith.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could get it.</v>

267
00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:52.430
<v Speaker 2>I've had this guy on Ron miscavige who's</v>
<v Speaker 2>David Miscavige is dad.</v>

268
00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:53.330
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who's</v>

269
00:11:54.290 --> 00:11:58.480
<v Speaker 5>scientology?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I had Leah Remini on and we talked</v>

270
00:11:58.481 --> 00:12:03.481
<v Speaker 5>for three hours about how crazy her life</v>
<v Speaker 5>and scientology was near a classic sp.</v>

271
00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:05.710
<v Speaker 5>There's no way you're getting a</v>
<v Speaker 5>suppressive person.</v>

272
00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:06.730
<v Speaker 5>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not.</v>

273
00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:08.500
<v Speaker 5>I'm just misunderstood.</v>

274
00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:11.140
<v Speaker 3>I got to say though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the more I learned about the</v>

275
00:12:11.141 --> 00:12:15.040
<v Speaker 3>Catholic faith and all these kid fuckers</v>
<v Speaker 3>keep coming out,</v>

276
00:12:15.041 --> 00:12:16.780
<v Speaker 3>the more I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the worst one.</v>

277
00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:19.420
<v Speaker 5>Did you see the new one keepers don't</v>
<v Speaker 5>know the new.</v>

278
00:12:21.170 --> 00:12:26.170
<v Speaker 5>There's a thousand cases of child</v>
<v Speaker 5>molesting that they just uncovered.</v>

279
00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:29.770
<v Speaker 5>Shut down that religion.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Catholic trump monsters.</v>

280
00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:31.680
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

281
00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:34.750
<v Speaker 5>I'm not doing a pit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but all $8,000 it was connected to the</v>

282
00:12:34.751 --> 00:12:36.460
<v Speaker 5>church at Jamie will find it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was just some.</v>

283
00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:39.220
<v Speaker 5>I mean I didn't even read it because I</v>
<v Speaker 5>looked at the headline and the first</v>

284
00:12:39.221 --> 00:12:42.250
<v Speaker 5>thought was de and second thought was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ugh,</v>

285
00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:43.250
<v Speaker 5>like you just can't.</v>

286
00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:46.880
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's so much worse than like</v>
<v Speaker 3>making some unbelieved they can get</v>

287
00:12:46.881 --> 00:12:49.970
<v Speaker 3>acting work like whatever scientology</v>
<v Speaker 3>does.</v>

288
00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:55.250
<v Speaker 3>Like the Catholic religion is like their</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking little girls and boys and like</v>

289
00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:59.120
<v Speaker 3>permanently ruining their lives,</v>
<v Speaker 3>making them have like terrible</v>

290
00:12:59.121 --> 00:13:02.510
<v Speaker 3>flashbacks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>making them have like wide chunks of</v>

291
00:13:02.511 --> 00:13:05.570
<v Speaker 3>memory that they just don't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then they do remember and it's like,</v>

292
00:13:05.571 --> 00:13:08.510
<v Speaker 3>it's just the worst thing you can do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And how do you like sexual problems?</v>

293
00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:10.250
<v Speaker 3>I'm not Catholic and Jewish now.</v>

294
00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:11.430
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know the pope,</v>

295
00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:13.560
<v Speaker 5>the pope,</v>
<v Speaker 5>ratzinger,</v>

296
00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:16.430
<v Speaker 5>that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One of the things that they do,</v>

297
00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:18.670
<v Speaker 5>one of the reasons why he stepped down</v>
<v Speaker 5>was because they,</v>

298
00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:21.990
<v Speaker 5>they found out that he was one of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>guys that used to move people around</v>

299
00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:23.820
<v Speaker 5>common.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was one of the guys.</v>

300
00:13:23.821 --> 00:13:25.680
<v Speaker 5>When someone get caught molesting</v>
<v Speaker 5>children,</v>

301
00:13:25.681 --> 00:13:27.680
<v Speaker 5>he would move into a new new precinct</v>

302
00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:29.513
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what do you call it?</v>

303
00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:31.790
<v Speaker 6>That's what takes your breath away.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We live actually right next to a</v>

304
00:13:31.791 --> 00:13:34.820
<v Speaker 6>rehabilitation center,</v>
<v Speaker 6>former rehabilitation center for wayward</v>

305
00:13:34.821 --> 00:13:36.170
<v Speaker 6>priests on our street</v>

306
00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:37.441
<v Speaker 3>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh.</v>

307
00:13:37.441 --> 00:13:38.161
<v Speaker 3>I always thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

308
00:13:38.161 --> 00:13:40.080
<v Speaker 3>wayward praise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I wonder what that means.</v>

309
00:13:40.081 --> 00:13:41.910
<v Speaker 3>And then after we saw that movie</v>
<v Speaker 3>spotlight,</v>

310
00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:44.790
<v Speaker 3>we looked it up and that's exactly where</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were.</v>

311
00:13:44.791 --> 00:13:48.630
<v Speaker 3>Housing p one was one of the places they</v>
<v Speaker 3>were housing the molesters</v>

312
00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:50.360
<v Speaker 6>follow.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It makes this really interesting point</v>

313
00:13:50.361 --> 00:13:53.780
<v Speaker 6>about the church,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is the commonly held sort of folk</v>

314
00:13:53.781 --> 00:13:57.140
<v Speaker 6>belief about the Catholic church is that</v>
<v Speaker 6>when you take away someone's ability to</v>

315
00:13:57.141 --> 00:13:58.520
<v Speaker 6>have sex,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you will.</v>

316
00:13:58.910 --> 00:14:03.910
<v Speaker 6>You will concentrate their sex drive and</v>
<v Speaker 6>pervert it and you'll become a child</v>

317
00:14:04.011 --> 00:14:04.980
<v Speaker 6>molester.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And what?</v>

318
00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:07.580
<v Speaker 6>Spotlight the movie sort of point that</v>
<v Speaker 6>it makes us.</v>

319
00:14:07.581 --> 00:14:11.030
<v Speaker 6>It's the other way around.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's that that basically what you're a</v>

320
00:14:11.031 --> 00:14:13.160
<v Speaker 6>child molester,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you go to the church because you know</v>

321
00:14:13.161 --> 00:14:14.390
<v Speaker 6>they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they'll give you a haven.</v>

322
00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:16.140
<v Speaker 3>Don't feel cover for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's true though,</v>

323
00:14:16.141 --> 00:14:20.100
<v Speaker 3>like it is hard to become a priest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to like study scripture for.</v>

324
00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:21.440
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how long has he been here?</v>

325
00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:23.790
<v Speaker 6>Did molest a child?</v>
<v Speaker 6>You got to groom them,</v>

326
00:14:23.791 --> 00:14:25.230
<v Speaker 6>you got to hang out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know what I mean?</v>

327
00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:26.840
<v Speaker 3>But seriously know how true that.</v>

328
00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:31.580
<v Speaker 5>So ratzinger moved to God that went onto</v>
<v Speaker 5>molest 100 deaf kids.</v>

329
00:14:31.890 --> 00:14:34.250
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I saw this documentary because they</v>

330
00:14:34.251 --> 00:14:36.170
<v Speaker 5>couldn't talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There would be.</v>

331
00:14:37.090 --> 00:14:38.600
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but no one's gonna listen to them.</v>

332
00:14:38.630 --> 00:14:40.820
<v Speaker 5>It's not like they can just start</v>
<v Speaker 5>talking,</v>

333
00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:43.250
<v Speaker 5>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like it's a weight just.</v>

334
00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:46.160
<v Speaker 5>I mean he was working with deaf kids,</v>
<v Speaker 5>deaf orphans.</v>

335
00:14:46.190 --> 00:14:46.881
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just,</v>

336
00:14:46.881 --> 00:14:49.040
<v Speaker 5>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nobody would listen to a deaf person.</v>

337
00:14:49.041 --> 00:14:52.250
<v Speaker 5>It's it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is how scams one step removed.</v>

338
00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:53.540
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's one more.</v>

339
00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:56.420
<v Speaker 2>What you want when you want as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>Predator is,</v>

340
00:14:56.480 --> 00:15:00.040
<v Speaker 2>is the most vulnerable person that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>can be predatory towards.</v>

341
00:15:00.270 --> 00:15:04.320
<v Speaker 3>It's like a documentary keepers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't until this girl came to the</v>

342
00:15:04.321 --> 00:15:06.780
<v Speaker 3>priest and said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I actually have been molested.</v>

343
00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:08.250
<v Speaker 3>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

344
00:15:08.251 --> 00:15:12.150
<v Speaker 3>you have have you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then he started molesting or waited</v>

345
00:15:12.151 --> 00:15:14.010
<v Speaker 3>for her to come into.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a confession.</v>

346
00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:16.080
<v Speaker 3>Found that she was weak,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she was weak.</v>

347
00:15:16.081 --> 00:15:18.360
<v Speaker 3>And then that's who we picked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's like,</v>

348
00:15:18.490 --> 00:15:21.010
<v Speaker 2>why remember these Nigeria?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Speaking of psychotic.</v>

349
00:15:21.130 --> 00:15:22.120
<v Speaker 2>It's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

350
00:15:22.510 --> 00:15:23.660
<v Speaker 2>But that's what they want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

351
00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:26.300
<v Speaker 2>the molester.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lester loves the weak,</v>

352
00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:29.680
<v Speaker 2>the weak and vulnerable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because if they go to a strong confident</v>

353
00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:32.410
<v Speaker 2>child who they know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would it be like if you touch me,</v>

354
00:15:32.411 --> 00:15:37.411
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell my fucking dad molested.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That girl's got a big mouth also.</v>

355
00:15:38.051 --> 00:15:40.810
<v Speaker 2>You do not touch her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen your,</v>

356
00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:42.100
<v Speaker 2>your baby pictures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want a hug.</v>

357
00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:45.030
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was always trying to.</v>

358
00:15:45.031 --> 00:15:48.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's very much always boys,</v>

359
00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:50.460
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Keepers.</v>

360
00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:51.633
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

361
00:15:52.110 --> 00:15:54.030
<v Speaker 3>It's girls and boys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like who?</v>

362
00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:57.400
<v Speaker 3>I've only seen documentaries on boys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the boys thing is weird,</v>

363
00:15:57.401 --> 00:16:00.140
<v Speaker 3>but I kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do believe there's a math to like</v>

364
00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:04.270
<v Speaker 3>suppressing someone's sexuality and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just gonna come out in these other</v>

365
00:16:04.271 --> 00:16:04.680
<v Speaker 3>ways.</v>

366
00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:07.890
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that also monsters are</v>

367
00:16:08.310 --> 00:16:11.630
<v Speaker 2>orientation is spread equally across</v>
<v Speaker 2>monsters.</v>

368
00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:12.950
<v Speaker 2>So oriented.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

369
00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:15.060
<v Speaker 2>I think that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know.</v>

370
00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:17.040
<v Speaker 2>Are you gay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're a child molester,</v>

371
00:16:17.050 --> 00:16:18.360
<v Speaker 2>likes little boys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that even gay?</v>

372
00:16:18.361 --> 00:16:20.030
<v Speaker 2>That seems like a third thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just you're,</v>

373
00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:22.410
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not even in a sexual zone</v>

374
00:16:22.411 --> 00:16:23.880
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you're in a pathology zone.</v>

375
00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:27.600
<v Speaker 3>But since the cases are so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's so many cases,</v>

376
00:16:27.601 --> 00:16:31.080
<v Speaker 3>like maybe we should just let priests</v>
<v Speaker 3>get married or something needs to</v>

377
00:16:31.081 --> 00:16:31.530
<v Speaker 3>change.</v>

378
00:16:31.530 --> 00:16:32.550
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they used to be able to,</v>

379
00:16:32.610 --> 00:16:35.980
<v Speaker 5>but they were rockstars.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The problem was back in the days like</v>

380
00:16:36.050 --> 00:16:38.850
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>during the Lutheran days when Martin</v>

381
00:16:38.850 --> 00:16:41.310
<v Speaker 5>Luther was around,</v>
<v Speaker 5>priests controlled everything.</v>

382
00:16:41.510 --> 00:16:43.530
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they fucked everybody's wives.</v>

383
00:16:43.531 --> 00:16:44.071
<v Speaker 5>They,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

384
00:16:44.071 --> 00:16:46.980
<v Speaker 5>the pope.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The pope had wives and children.</v>

385
00:16:47.250 --> 00:16:49.200
<v Speaker 5>Pope's had wives,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they had children,</v>

386
00:16:49.201 --> 00:16:50.550
<v Speaker 5>they had money,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they had armies.</v>

387
00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:54.090
<v Speaker 5>The Roman Catholic Pope controlled</v>
<v Speaker 5>armies.</v>

388
00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:57.960
<v Speaker 5>They controlled troops.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like it was a totally different scene</v>

389
00:16:58.140 --> 00:17:00.960
<v Speaker 5>and then somewhere along the line they</v>
<v Speaker 5>were fucking so many women that were</v>

390
00:17:00.961 --> 00:17:01.794
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

391
00:17:01.950 --> 00:17:03.900
<v Speaker 5>here's the new role.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're going to be a priest.</v>

392
00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:06.480
<v Speaker 5>You can't fucking chicks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then just the whole thing went,</v>

393
00:17:06.481 --> 00:17:08.460
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>does anybody know why that happened?</v>

394
00:17:08.461 --> 00:17:10.440
<v Speaker 5>Why the changeover happened?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because they were rock stars.</v>

395
00:17:10.441 --> 00:17:11.550
<v Speaker 5>Because there were banging everybody.</v>

396
00:17:11.550 --> 00:17:13.180
<v Speaker 2>No Sir.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why they made them not raw.</v>

397
00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:13.940
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>

398
00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:15.210
<v Speaker 2>they were too irresponsible.</v>

399
00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:17.900
<v Speaker 5>This is what I've read.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What I've read is that there were,</v>

400
00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:21.440
<v Speaker 5>there was a real concern amongst people</v>
<v Speaker 5>that were,</v>

401
00:17:21.441 --> 00:17:23.750
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>under the tutelage of these priests that</v>

402
00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:26.420
<v Speaker 5>these guys were out of control.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're just banging everybody</v>

403
00:17:26.910 --> 00:17:31.500
<v Speaker 3>find out what was the reason why they</v>
<v Speaker 3>made them not able to say,</v>

404
00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:33.720
<v Speaker 3>I wonder what you think that is.</v>

405
00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:36.520
<v Speaker 5>It wasn't that long ago.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Elaine was like a thousand years ago.</v>

406
00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:38.970
<v Speaker 5>It might've been less.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's so interesting.</v>

407
00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:42.220
<v Speaker 5>I think it was less than a thousand</v>
<v Speaker 5>years ago because I know that during the</v>

408
00:17:42.221 --> 00:17:46.510
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible] con era,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the pope still at armies and I think</v>

409
00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:49.260
<v Speaker 5>still,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think there were still allowed be</v>

410
00:17:49.261 --> 00:17:50.030
<v Speaker 5>married and have children</v>

411
00:17:50.030 --> 00:17:54.300
<v Speaker 3>and they were using their religious</v>
<v Speaker 3>status to abuse</v>

412
00:17:54.710 --> 00:17:59.710
<v Speaker 2>their power and probably probably women</v>
<v Speaker 2>would like fall for them too.</v>

413
00:18:00.290 --> 00:18:02.810
<v Speaker 2>There was no cigarette.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If there's no musicians,</v>

414
00:18:02.811 --> 00:18:07.811
<v Speaker 2>there's no comedian who was going to go</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the are going to go.</v>

415
00:18:08.450 --> 00:18:10.160
<v Speaker 2>The gestures are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had comics back then.</v>

416
00:18:10.330 --> 00:18:11.930
<v Speaker 2>It was good with like a floppy hat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

417
00:18:11.931 --> 00:18:15.490
<v Speaker 2>but they were like cruise ship comics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They couldn't get out of line at all.</v>

418
00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:17.390
<v Speaker 2>They got killed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I still rock stars.</v>

419
00:18:17.391 --> 00:18:19.010
<v Speaker 2>They were just like had white hair and</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

420
00:18:19.011 --> 00:18:21.500
<v Speaker 2>what's the deal with the latrine that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to shift in?</v>

421
00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:25.250
<v Speaker 2>What is the deal with cornish game hen</v>
<v Speaker 2>the white hair play the piano.</v>

422
00:18:25.251 --> 00:18:27.090
<v Speaker 2>That was later.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was like,</v>

423
00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:30.560
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is like a dude plucking a lute.</v>

424
00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:31.910
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to find out.</v>

425
00:18:31.911 --> 00:18:32.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably right.</v>

426
00:18:32.850 --> 00:18:37.040
<v Speaker 2>Your harp have a timeline.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is this idea that the guy,</v>

427
00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:41.240
<v Speaker 2>the itinerant singer that would come to</v>
<v Speaker 2>talent and luck pluck the loot and tell</v>

428
00:18:41.241 --> 00:18:44.380
<v Speaker 2>like the tail was always fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody everywhere went.</v>

429
00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:45.930
<v Speaker 3>That's got to be who we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who.</v>

430
00:18:45.931 --> 00:18:48.300
<v Speaker 3>We all came from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like Robert Plant came from the</v>

431
00:18:48.301 --> 00:18:51.540
<v Speaker 3>gestures.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rock are versus comedian,</v>

432
00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:53.790
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were the people who would come in on</v>

433
00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:57.000
<v Speaker 3>a wagon and juggling balls of manure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

434
00:18:57.001 --> 00:19:00.030
<v Speaker 3>like the king has the years of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would like to see you on the head with</v>

435
00:19:00.031 --> 00:19:00.864
<v Speaker 3>a baguette.</v>

436
00:19:01.050 --> 00:19:04.830
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that you guys have like</v>
<v Speaker 2>genetic ancestry to former comedians?</v>

437
00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:05.903
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

438
00:19:06.010 --> 00:19:08.240
<v Speaker 3>I believe in that more than most of us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe.</v>

439
00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:10.810
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just feel like I have a blood memory</v>

440
00:19:10.811 --> 00:19:12.100
<v Speaker 3>of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like for example,</v>

441
00:19:12.101 --> 00:19:15.190
<v Speaker 3>I do think there are people in comedy</v>
<v Speaker 3>who are doing it because that's where</v>

442
00:19:15.191 --> 00:19:18.430
<v Speaker 3>like the energy is right now and they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like trying to like make money and.</v>

443
00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:19.530
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

444
00:19:19.530 --> 00:19:20.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or whoever or.</v>

445
00:19:20.951 --> 00:19:23.380
<v Speaker 2>I think it's moved beyond that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like now it's like everybody that</v>

446
00:19:23.381 --> 00:19:27.130
<v Speaker 2>you would have been a dj when I was like</v>
<v Speaker 2>17 is now a comedian.</v>

447
00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:28.450
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is a lot of that.</v>

448
00:19:28.490 --> 00:19:31.460
<v Speaker 2>But I love you guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

449
00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:32.800
<v Speaker 2>what I was going to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't really care.</v>

450
00:19:32.801 --> 00:19:34.680
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think you just have to like</v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself.</v>

451
00:19:34.970 --> 00:19:37.930
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't bother me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's cool because when you go</v>

452
00:19:37.931 --> 00:19:41.740
<v Speaker 2>big then the 10 percent of geniuses that</v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't have started.</v>

453
00:19:41.741 --> 00:19:44.620
<v Speaker 2>If it wasn't cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll start and then the 90 percent of</v>

454
00:19:44.621 --> 00:19:46.380
<v Speaker 2>people that we're going to be garbage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do they.</v>

455
00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:48.100
<v Speaker 2>They don't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Damn Ninety 10,</v>

456
00:19:48.101 --> 00:19:49.130
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>

457
00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:51.280
<v Speaker 2>Probably less.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably 90 nine.</v>

458
00:19:51.281 --> 00:19:56.281
<v Speaker 2>One genius person that starts comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That to becoming like a forget genius</v>

459
00:19:58.230 --> 00:20:01.840
<v Speaker 2>person that starts comedy does a set at</v>
<v Speaker 2>an open mic to becomes like one of the</v>

460
00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:06.010
<v Speaker 2>great comedians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like even in the top 10 percent of</v>

461
00:20:06.011 --> 00:20:08.290
<v Speaker 2>comedians that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's gotta be one percent.</v>

462
00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:12.790
<v Speaker 2>That's the point that time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the problem with is like you say</v>

463
00:20:12.791 --> 00:20:17.380
<v Speaker 2>once they start,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because the 99 point nine percent that</v>

464
00:20:17.381 --> 00:20:20.890
<v Speaker 2>start never even make it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's part of it.</v>

465
00:20:21.070 --> 00:20:23.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like it's like the one percent that</v>

466
00:20:23.291 --> 00:20:26.280
<v Speaker 2>do the point one percent that actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>become professional committees.</v>

467
00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:30.430
<v Speaker 2>Like how many people out of your group</v>
<v Speaker 2>of open microbes that used to hang with,</v>

468
00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:32.080
<v Speaker 2>how many are still doing standup?</v>

469
00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:34.690
<v Speaker 3>That ratio because how many of them have</v>
<v Speaker 3>a TV show?</v>

470
00:20:34.691 --> 00:20:39.330
<v Speaker 3>All of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it's easier to be famous now.</v>

471
00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:40.900
<v Speaker 3>So your ratios are a little off.</v>

472
00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:44.520
<v Speaker 2>I remember when.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well yeah,</v>

473
00:20:44.521 --> 00:20:44.930
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

474
00:20:44.930 --> 00:20:46.740
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the numbers are very start.</v>

475
00:20:46.741 --> 00:20:49.870
<v Speaker 2>I remember when I first started like I</v>
<v Speaker 2>would have,</v>

476
00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:55.020
<v Speaker 2>I would have fucked a let a man fuck me</v>
<v Speaker 2>50 times to get like a Montreal spot and</v>

477
00:20:55.391 --> 00:20:58.890
<v Speaker 2>now it's like 50 times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've thought about it a lot and they</v>

478
00:20:58.891 --> 00:21:00.760
<v Speaker 2>would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would rub my back very gently and</v>

479
00:21:00.761 --> 00:21:02.920
<v Speaker 2>smuggling take me on like Alonzo Bowden.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

480
00:21:02.921 --> 00:21:05.550
<v Speaker 2>That he could do 25 times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>

481
00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:08.070
<v Speaker 2>I looked at Alonzo Bowden's fingers once</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was like,</v>

482
00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:11.130
<v Speaker 2>there are men with Dick smaller than</v>
<v Speaker 2>your finger off for sure.</v>

483
00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:13.890
<v Speaker 2>Bottom line.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dick.</v>

484
00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:15.530
<v Speaker 2>Smaller than your finger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

485
00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:16.930
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's rough.</v>

486
00:21:16.990 --> 00:21:18.070
<v Speaker 2>If that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's true.</v>

487
00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:18.860
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alonzo,</v>

488
00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:20.350
<v Speaker 2>if you're listening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every time I look at your hands,</v>

489
00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:23.640
<v Speaker 2>I think it was Dick's small ticks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>

490
00:21:24.730 --> 00:21:26.310
<v Speaker 2>But my boy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

491
00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:29.250
<v Speaker 2>I would've done anything for a Montreal</v>
<v Speaker 2>spot or,</v>

492
00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:30.670
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or a spot on,</v>

493
00:21:30.730 --> 00:21:32.230
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the tonight show.</v>

494
00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:34.560
<v Speaker 2>And now there's young comics who like</v>
<v Speaker 2>are like,</v>

495
00:21:34.810 --> 00:21:37.090
<v Speaker 2>Nah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not really trying to like be a</v>

496
00:21:37.091 --> 00:21:39.460
<v Speaker 2>second lead on a show right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm really waiting.</v>

497
00:21:39.461 --> 00:21:41.560
<v Speaker 2>Well from my vehicle it things have</v>
<v Speaker 2>changed.</v>

498
00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:43.660
<v Speaker 2>I dated a girl that was like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was like,</v>

499
00:21:43.661 --> 00:21:45.880
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to do TV.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm holding out for film because I was</v>

500
00:21:45.881 --> 00:21:50.080
<v Speaker 2>on a television show at the time and she</v>
<v Speaker 2>was saying that she didn't want to do</v>

501
00:21:50.081 --> 00:21:52.030
<v Speaker 2>TV.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like it was beneath her.</v>

502
00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:53.770
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're doing tv at the time.</v>

503
00:21:54.220 --> 00:21:55.580
<v Speaker 2>Was that news radio?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

504
00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:56.473
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

505
00:21:56.700 --> 00:21:58.480
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm a fan of that show.</v>

506
00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:02.110
<v Speaker 3>I took an acting class with Paris Hilton</v>
<v Speaker 3>and she and the teacher was like,</v>

507
00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:05.860
<v Speaker 3>who wants to do tv?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And everyone raised their hand except</v>

508
00:22:05.861 --> 00:22:06.521
<v Speaker 3>her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was like,</v>

509
00:22:06.521 --> 00:22:08.380
<v Speaker 3>who wants to do just movies in Paris?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hilton,</v>

510
00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:11.310
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's terrific course once we legit.</v>

511
00:22:11.650 --> 00:22:13.840
<v Speaker 2>That's so fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the thing in the nineties.</v>

512
00:22:14.050 --> 00:22:16.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess know the Paris Hilton is one of</v>

513
00:22:16.601 --> 00:22:21.490
<v Speaker 2>the top highest paid djs in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She can't have good taste in music.</v>

514
00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:23.420
<v Speaker 2>Be a DJ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's not a DJ.</v>

515
00:22:23.430 --> 00:22:27.390
<v Speaker 2>Also has like 20 perfumes and suck</v>
<v Speaker 2>should go into deejaying.</v>

516
00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:32.020
<v Speaker 2>It seems like it's an open market.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dominate if you have half a sense of</v>

517
00:22:32.021 --> 00:22:32.720
<v Speaker 2>entertainment.</v>

518
00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:34.980
<v Speaker 3>That guy's got a billboard on sunset.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most is like,</v>

519
00:22:35.130 --> 00:22:37.720
<v Speaker 3>he is like deejaying at a swimming pool</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Las Vegas.</v>

520
00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:43.020
<v Speaker 2>It was a huge famous celebrity Dj.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know how in La you'll always know</v>

521
00:22:43.181 --> 00:22:46.510
<v Speaker 2>what's happening in Vegas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Paul Harris or one of those guys,</v>

522
00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:49.630
<v Speaker 2>and it was literally you look down and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like Vegas Swim Club,</v>

523
00:22:50.190 --> 00:22:54.400
<v Speaker 2>Dj in a pool,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but those pools will have 15,000 people</v>

524
00:22:54.401 --> 00:22:58.120
<v Speaker 2>stuffed into the area going crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Horny dude.</v>

525
00:22:58.121 --> 00:23:00.210
<v Speaker 2>That's probably where I would hang out</v>
<v Speaker 2>with one girl.</v>

526
00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:02.620
<v Speaker 2>She's going to go hang out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's on her way.</v>

527
00:23:03.250 --> 00:23:04.930
<v Speaker 2>She's going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're stopping there on the honeymoon</v>

528
00:23:04.931 --> 00:23:09.931
<v Speaker 2>tour where a Nixon mask and just go</v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy and mix it with like a beautiful</v>

529
00:23:10.421 --> 00:23:15.421
<v Speaker 2>naked woman body with a Nixon mask on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I heard that they recently,</v>

530
00:23:16.991 --> 00:23:19.480
<v Speaker 2>this could be bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>started making more money on their</v>

531
00:23:19.481 --> 00:23:21.650
<v Speaker 2>nightclubs and on the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>On the casinos.</v>

532
00:23:21.670 --> 00:23:24.520
<v Speaker 2>That's got to be true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It may be.</v>

533
00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:26.440
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the numbers are,</v>

534
00:23:26.441 --> 00:23:28.670
<v Speaker 2>but I would imagine they make a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>money on the casinos.</v>

535
00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:31.870
<v Speaker 2>People like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's up?</v>

536
00:23:31.930 --> 00:23:34.780
<v Speaker 2>I just heard John Taffer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that guy that does bar rescue talking</v>

537
00:23:34.781 --> 00:23:38.680
<v Speaker 2>about it on another interview,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said they'll go in on Friday night</v>

538
00:23:38.681 --> 00:23:42.670
<v Speaker 2>and make about 500,000 bucks for their</v>
<v Speaker 2>clubs show and then wake up the next</v>

539
00:23:42.670 --> 00:23:46.200
<v Speaker 2>morning and do the pool at noon for 150.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't know.</v>

540
00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:47.780
<v Speaker 2>You're talking about the actual</v>
<v Speaker 2>performance.</v>

541
00:23:47.790 --> 00:23:50.540
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about the club itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're talking about the casino.</v>

542
00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:54.650
<v Speaker 2>The casino makes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But imagine that if the Dj mix $650,000</v>

543
00:23:54.651 --> 00:23:57.350
<v Speaker 2>for a weekend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to multiply that by what?</v>

544
00:23:57.560 --> 00:23:59.120
<v Speaker 2>Twenty 100 percent.</v>

545
00:23:59.130 --> 00:24:00.900
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they may have the odd person like I am</v>

546
00:24:00.901 --> 00:24:02.670
<v Speaker 3>on that show dice about Andrew dice</v>
<v Speaker 3>clay.</v>

547
00:24:02.671 --> 00:24:06.380
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever had him do this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Many times as you know?</v>

548
00:24:06.381 --> 00:24:10.260
<v Speaker 3>I mean I didn't know a real thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in the show,</v>

549
00:24:10.261 --> 00:24:14.670
<v Speaker 3>the whole premise is that he's paying</v>
<v Speaker 3>off his gambling debt to the casino</v>

550
00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:17.760
<v Speaker 3>because it's like $800,000 and it's the</v>
<v Speaker 3>only way you can pay it back.</v>

551
00:24:17.761 --> 00:24:20.530
<v Speaker 3>But that's a true story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was in debt,</v>

552
00:24:20.531 --> 00:24:23.190
<v Speaker 3>like he would lose $800,000 in one</v>
<v Speaker 3>night.</v>

553
00:24:23.191 --> 00:24:24.810
<v Speaker 3>So as long as they have people like</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

554
00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:27.270
<v Speaker 3>they must be making a lot of money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

555
00:24:27.271 --> 00:24:28.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's always gonna be.</v>

556
00:24:28.170 --> 00:24:31.590
<v Speaker 3>It was always like the old lady like</v>
<v Speaker 3>putting in nickels but then there's also</v>

557
00:24:31.591 --> 00:24:32.550
<v Speaker 3>like dice,</v>

558
00:24:32.890 --> 00:24:35.740
<v Speaker 2>but you also have to think like how much</v>
<v Speaker 2>money does it cost to run a casino?</v>

559
00:24:35.770 --> 00:24:37.690
<v Speaker 2>The overhead is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

560
00:24:37.770 --> 00:24:41.560
<v Speaker 2>It's also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they also exist in this odd like venn</v>

561
00:24:41.561 --> 00:24:45.790
<v Speaker 2>diagram of like a legal business and an</v>
<v Speaker 2>old world like criminal.</v>

562
00:24:46.490 --> 00:24:49.980
<v Speaker 3>And I don't mean that in a Mafia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like don't they have like India,</v>

563
00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:51.730
<v Speaker 3>like why is it even legal for them?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

564
00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:54.520
<v Speaker 2>For them to let someone rack up an</v>
<v Speaker 2>$800,000 debt,</v>

565
00:24:54.521 --> 00:24:56.890
<v Speaker 2>like a normal business business would</v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

566
00:24:56.980 --> 00:24:59.230
<v Speaker 2>sir,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're $20 over your limit.</v>

567
00:24:59.231 --> 00:25:00.850
<v Speaker 2>So we're going to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just know,</v>

568
00:25:00.851 --> 00:25:02.610
<v Speaker 2>like he's got credit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's nice,</v>

569
00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:04.710
<v Speaker 2>he's going to make money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's gonna.</v>

570
00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:11.600
<v Speaker 3>He gambled away the deed to his house at</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Riviera and like they just lost my</v>

571
00:25:13.070 --> 00:25:15.180
<v Speaker 3>hip,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hurt my Nana's wedding ring.</v>

572
00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:19.210
<v Speaker 3>And then someone told me when I was at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was at foxwoods and they said because</v>

573
00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:22.110
<v Speaker 3>I was performing and they said that at</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mohegan Sun,</v>

574
00:25:22.111 --> 00:25:22.681
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

575
00:25:22.681 --> 00:25:26.130
<v Speaker 3>it's gotten really bad at Mohegan Sun</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you gamble away your car,</v>

576
00:25:26.131 --> 00:25:29.040
<v Speaker 3>they won't even give you a ride home.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But we at foxwoods or giving people</v>

577
00:25:29.041 --> 00:25:32.540
<v Speaker 3>rides like it's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like people are just like,</v>

578
00:25:32.730 --> 00:25:34.290
<v Speaker 3>they run out of money and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

579
00:25:34.291 --> 00:25:36.780
<v Speaker 3>I could win it all back if I just sell</v>
<v Speaker 3>the car.</v>

580
00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:39.180
<v Speaker 3>And it's like they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

581
00:25:39.310 --> 00:25:40.570
<v Speaker 2>Here's what's interesting though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>

582
00:25:40.571 --> 00:25:43.820
<v Speaker 2>when they ban you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like my friend Dana,</v>

583
00:25:46.090 --> 00:25:49.300
<v Speaker 2>Dana white is a notorious gambler,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he wins millions of dollars</v>

584
00:25:49.301 --> 00:25:50.134
<v Speaker 2>sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

585
00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:55.120
<v Speaker 2>I think he said he lost his much as</v>
<v Speaker 2>$1,000,000 and he's won as much as 7</v>

586
00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:56.270
<v Speaker 2>million in another.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

587
00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:58.210
<v Speaker 2>Has He gotten banned from playing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

588
00:25:58.211 --> 00:25:59.240
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dana.</v>

589
00:25:59.510 --> 00:26:02.110
<v Speaker 2>He's a celebrity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He only does he get banned,</v>

590
00:26:02.111 --> 00:26:04.780
<v Speaker 2>but he gets banned and then he pulls the</v>
<v Speaker 2>UFC out of them.</v>

591
00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:08.530
<v Speaker 2>Like these two do ufc at the palms and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he killed the palms and the palms</v>

592
00:26:08.531 --> 00:26:09.460
<v Speaker 2>bandom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's like,</v>

593
00:26:09.461 --> 00:26:11.590
<v Speaker 2>fuck you Ben,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you and I moved to the hard rock or</v>

594
00:26:11.591 --> 00:26:13.300
<v Speaker 2>wherever the hell they moved in next.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

595
00:26:13.301 --> 00:26:15.520
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've banned him from a bunch of</v>

596
00:26:15.521 --> 00:26:17.530
<v Speaker 2>casinos because he's really good at</v>
<v Speaker 2>blackjack.</v>

597
00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:18.640
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you.</v>

598
00:26:18.670 --> 00:26:21.760
<v Speaker 2>What stakes is what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the minimum bet for the Dana</v>

599
00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:22.990
<v Speaker 2>White blocks?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wish I knew.</v>

600
00:26:23.050 --> 00:26:24.310
<v Speaker 2>That sounds fucking crazy.</v>

601
00:26:24.570 --> 00:26:27.030
<v Speaker 3>How is that legal?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The band someone once they win at the</v>

602
00:26:27.031 --> 00:26:28.230
<v Speaker 3>thing you're saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying</v>

603
00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:31.860
<v Speaker 2>these casinos are not fully legal there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like in this weird area.</v>

604
00:26:31.890 --> 00:26:34.770
<v Speaker 2>They reserve the right to ban new if you</v>
<v Speaker 2>kicked their ass,</v>

605
00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:37.320
<v Speaker 2>which is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can they say you're card counting or</v>

606
00:26:37.321 --> 00:26:38.790
<v Speaker 2>something?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Card County.</v>

607
00:26:38.791 --> 00:26:40.230
<v Speaker 2>I mean even if you are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter.</v>

608
00:26:40.231 --> 00:26:41.850
<v Speaker 2>It's legal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you can do whatever the fuck you</v>

609
00:26:41.851 --> 00:26:44.010
<v Speaker 2>want I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's as long as it's</v>

610
00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:46.200
<v Speaker 5>on your head,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you're not using a calculator or</v>

611
00:26:46.201 --> 00:26:49.560
<v Speaker 5>something that's technically within the</v>
<v Speaker 5>rules of the game because your job is to</v>

612
00:26:49.561 --> 00:26:52.250
<v Speaker 5>sit down and I guess cow card counting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But blackjack.</v>

613
00:26:52.730 --> 00:26:54.910
<v Speaker 5>I mean you're supposed to not know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like if you say,</v>

614
00:26:54.940 --> 00:26:57.900
<v Speaker 5>if you have knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so we'll still ignore it and you know</v>

615
00:26:57.901 --> 00:26:59.730
<v Speaker 5>how to count cards.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's so stupid.</v>

616
00:26:59.731 --> 00:27:02.600
<v Speaker 5>It's like a girl going to a bar watching</v>
<v Speaker 5>a guy roofie or drink up.</v>

617
00:27:02.601 --> 00:27:06.240
<v Speaker 5>Can't pay attention to that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Set the rules to know what the fucking</v>

618
00:27:06.241 --> 00:27:07.100
<v Speaker 5>rules are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

619
00:27:07.170 --> 00:27:11.870
<v Speaker 5>The rules are like if you know how many</v>
<v Speaker 5>decks they're using and you know what</v>

620
00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:16.170
<v Speaker 5>you know when not to hit and just play</v>
<v Speaker 5>it smart and count and thinking</v>

621
00:27:16.171 --> 00:27:21.171
<v Speaker 5>calculate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know I also been a wiser retread.</v>

622
00:27:22.890 --> 00:27:25.680
<v Speaker 5>Why does Dana the root thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we all accepted it sort of.</v>

623
00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:26.340
<v Speaker 5>It's your house.</v>

624
00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:26.970
<v Speaker 5>We were like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>ah,</v>

625
00:27:26.970 --> 00:27:27.990
<v Speaker 5>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you got that?</v>

626
00:27:27.991 --> 00:27:28.760
<v Speaker 5>But I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hm,</v>

627
00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:30.620
<v Speaker 5>that's</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

628
00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:33.420
<v Speaker 5>why?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why does Dana white gamble or have no</v>

629
00:27:33.421 --> 00:27:36.050
<v Speaker 5>idea?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The famous basketball player that like</v>

630
00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:38.580
<v Speaker 5>Charles Barkley,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what drives those people?</v>

631
00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:40.540
<v Speaker 5>There were so rich.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why rules?</v>

632
00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:43.410
<v Speaker 5>What is also people that have been hit</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the head a lot?</v>

633
00:27:43.411 --> 00:27:47.100
<v Speaker 5>Dana has been hitting the head a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm notoriously impulsive and</v>

634
00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:49.980
<v Speaker 5>notoriously susceptible to addiction.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whether it's gambling,</v>

635
00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:51.020
<v Speaker 5>addiction,</v>
<v Speaker 5>alcoholic.</v>

636
00:27:51.450 --> 00:27:52.670
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

637
00:27:52.671 --> 00:27:56.820
<v Speaker 5>It's a big part of cte,</v>
<v Speaker 5>chronic traumatic encephalopathy,</v>

638
00:27:57.060 --> 00:27:58.560
<v Speaker 5>which you see.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think I said it right.</v>

639
00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:00.960
<v Speaker 5>That's a brain damage from getting hit</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the head.</v>

640
00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:05.070
<v Speaker 5>A big part of it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was a lot of boxing when he was</v>

641
00:28:05.071 --> 00:28:05.904
<v Speaker 5>young,</v>
<v Speaker 5>has been,</v>

642
00:28:06.540 --> 00:28:08.640
<v Speaker 5>has dome,</v>
<v Speaker 5>rattled a gigabit time.</v>

643
00:28:08.641 --> 00:28:09.910
<v Speaker 5>Scott,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that dome rattled here.</v>

644
00:28:09.911 --> 00:28:11.670
<v Speaker 5>You're not supposed to get punched in</v>
<v Speaker 5>the head ever.</v>

645
00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:13.560
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You definitely get punched in the head</v>

646
00:28:13.561 --> 00:28:15.180
<v Speaker 5>multiple times a day for years.</v>

647
00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:19.210
<v Speaker 5>What about like you train right now I</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't do any kickboxing sparring,</v>

648
00:28:19.270 --> 00:28:20.760
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because of that.</v>

649
00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:21.900
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and even in Jujitsu,</v>

650
00:28:21.901 --> 00:28:24.900
<v Speaker 5>you like slam into someone's knee</v>
<v Speaker 5>accidentally or ahead.</v>

651
00:28:24.901 --> 00:28:27.390
<v Speaker 5>You get your head bonked your dome</v>
<v Speaker 5>rabbit.</v>

652
00:28:27.391 --> 00:28:31.920
<v Speaker 5>It's not that common,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but when I was kickboxing boy I got hit</v>

653
00:28:31.921 --> 00:28:34.030
<v Speaker 5>in the head a lot to the point where I</v>
<v Speaker 5>just like.</v>

654
00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:36.180
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes I think about some of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>decisions I've made.</v>

655
00:28:36.181 --> 00:28:38.160
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's going on in their life?</v>

656
00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:41.010
<v Speaker 5>What screws are loose?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Even with headgear,</v>

657
00:28:41.011 --> 00:28:43.300
<v Speaker 5>you're saying you're still worse.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Here's worse.</v>

658
00:28:43.810 --> 00:28:46.340
<v Speaker 5>Pickier.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It actually makes an a,</v>

659
00:28:46.490 --> 00:28:49.680
<v Speaker 5>an artificial lever like save your head.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is this large?</v>

660
00:28:49.910 --> 00:28:53.430
<v Speaker 5>It means if you clip it here,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's gotten more of a fulcrum effect,</v>

661
00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:56.680
<v Speaker 5>whereas if your head is smaller and</v>
<v Speaker 5>compact and you just take it here,</v>

662
00:28:56.940 --> 00:29:00.240
<v Speaker 5>so Richard Nixon mask would be bad</v>
<v Speaker 5>because they had a big old chin</v>

663
00:29:00.410 --> 00:29:02.700
<v Speaker 5>knocking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>knocking little bit the rubber in the</v>

664
00:29:02.701 --> 00:29:05.610
<v Speaker 5>mask,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the the idea is not necessarily just</v>

665
00:29:05.611 --> 00:29:08.250
<v Speaker 5>the initial impact,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's how much your head moves,</v>

666
00:29:08.251 --> 00:29:08.940
<v Speaker 5>like how might look.</v>

667
00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:11.190
<v Speaker 5>The stronger your neck is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the less likely you already get brain</v>

668
00:29:11.191 --> 00:29:13.620
<v Speaker 5>damage.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So these guys do a lot of neck exercises</v>

669
00:29:13.621 --> 00:29:16.440
<v Speaker 5>just just just to keep their head stable</v>
<v Speaker 5>when it gets hit.</v>

670
00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:18.750
<v Speaker 5>The idea is like the more your head</v>
<v Speaker 5>moves,</v>

671
00:29:18.751 --> 00:29:22.980
<v Speaker 5>the more your brain's going swish around</v>
<v Speaker 5>inside your dome and and break off the</v>

672
00:29:22.981 --> 00:29:25.620
<v Speaker 5>connective tissue.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's also part of the problem is</v>

673
00:29:25.621 --> 00:29:27.960
<v Speaker 5>connective tissue.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This like really soft,</v>

674
00:29:27.961 --> 00:29:31.050
<v Speaker 5>almost like cotton candy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like tissue that connects your brain to</v>

675
00:29:31.051 --> 00:29:33.240
<v Speaker 5>the skull.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Which stuff gets ripped up.</v>

676
00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:37.750
<v Speaker 5>Would you rather be a nfl?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whatever the guy that linebacker thought</v>

677
00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:41.130
<v Speaker 5>it is a chore or a Longterm Prize</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fighter,</v>

678
00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:44.410
<v Speaker 5>longterm prize fighter for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Longterm prize fighters can get through</v>

679
00:29:44.411 --> 00:29:46.840
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like there's guys like Bernard Hopkins</v>

680
00:29:46.850 --> 00:29:50.650
<v Speaker 5>that fought into his fifties who speaks</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

681
00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:51.680
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and there's a.</v>

682
00:29:52.090 --> 00:29:54.220
<v Speaker 5>see the problem is even guys that speak</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

683
00:29:54.250 --> 00:29:57.400
<v Speaker 5>there's the weird shit that they do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the impulsive stuff.</v>

684
00:29:57.490 --> 00:30:00.490
<v Speaker 5>There's like if you talk to people that</v>
<v Speaker 5>are cte experts,</v>

685
00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:04.210
<v Speaker 5>they tell you some really disturbing</v>
<v Speaker 5>things about brain damage,</v>

686
00:30:04.450 --> 00:30:07.690
<v Speaker 5>about how it manifests itself in the</v>
<v Speaker 5>weird things that men find themselves</v>

687
00:30:07.691 --> 00:30:09.160
<v Speaker 5>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't even know why they're doing</v>

688
00:30:09.161 --> 00:30:11.170
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're just doing it and like real</v>

689
00:30:11.171 --> 00:30:15.030
<v Speaker 5>impulsive behavior and just stomping on</v>
<v Speaker 5>the gas on the highway and just like</v>

690
00:30:15.310 --> 00:30:19.360
<v Speaker 5>weird gambling stuff and sex stuff and</v>
<v Speaker 5>drug stuff.</v>

691
00:30:19.570 --> 00:30:22.690
<v Speaker 5>And a lot of it is connected to cte.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What have you looked over at?</v>

692
00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:23.633
<v Speaker 5>Hofstra was crying,</v>

693
00:30:23.730 --> 00:30:24.700
<v Speaker 4>looking at me.</v>

694
00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:31.710
<v Speaker 3>So watching MMA,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like where they're like doing 69 and</v>

695
00:30:31.711 --> 00:30:34.400
<v Speaker 3>just arriving,</v>
<v Speaker 3>arriving.</v>

696
00:30:34.580 --> 00:30:39.300
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one's got the head and in his dick and</v>

697
00:30:39.301 --> 00:30:43.020
<v Speaker 3>then the other one's got his stick and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just kinda like ride back and</v>

698
00:30:43.021 --> 00:30:43.854
<v Speaker 3>forth.</v>

699
00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:46.490
<v Speaker 4>And then just like one of the main</v>
<v Speaker 4>commentator</v>

700
00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:49.450
<v Speaker 4>say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

701

<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

702
00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:53.240
<v Speaker 4>he's got his head in his dick and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're rising photons that have said</v>

703
00:30:53.241 --> 00:30:55.820
<v Speaker 4>things along those lines.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>

704
00:30:55.821 --> 00:30:56.600
<v Speaker 4>I listened</v>

705
00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:58.280
<v Speaker 3>sport.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to understand from a woman</v>

706
00:30:58.300 --> 00:31:00.800
<v Speaker 3>who's not into sports and then sees that</v>

707
00:31:02.180 --> 00:31:03.013
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

708
00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:07.090
<v Speaker 4>it's like I don't understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She comes in and she says,</v>

709
00:31:07.210 --> 00:31:10.150
<v Speaker 4>always did derisively did your team win?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

710
00:31:10.151 --> 00:31:14.850
<v Speaker 4>there are no teams.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I'm just</v>

711
00:31:16.910 --> 00:31:21.510
<v Speaker 4>there barefoot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like they maybe have been fucking game.</v>

712
00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:24.840
<v Speaker 4>That's the video.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The video game lets you get a little gay</v>

713
00:31:24.850 --> 00:31:27.400
<v Speaker 4>or than the actual shoot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Actually,</v>

714
00:31:27.940 --> 00:31:31.570
<v Speaker 4>that's a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can actually fuck it was a great</v>

715
00:31:31.571 --> 00:31:32.404
<v Speaker 4>game.</v>

716
00:31:32.430 --> 00:31:34.910
<v Speaker 5>Could be no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it looks like a dude that's a.</v>

717
00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:36.330
<v Speaker 5>that's a dude a triangle.</v>

718
00:31:36.470 --> 00:31:38.990
<v Speaker 3>So it's people who don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't care about brain damage</v>

719
00:31:38.991 --> 00:31:40.580
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like this sport,</v>

720
00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:43.190
<v Speaker 3>this sport brings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is that funny?</v>

721
00:31:43.220 --> 00:31:46.340
<v Speaker 3>I don't you think that's important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't care about the cartilage that</v>

722
00:31:46.341 --> 00:31:47.330
<v Speaker 3>connects their head</v>

723
00:31:47.850 --> 00:31:51.210
<v Speaker 5>cartilages are the connective tissue,</v>
<v Speaker 5>connective tissue.</v>

724
00:31:51.570 --> 00:31:53.970
<v Speaker 5>It's not that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not that they don't care,</v>

725
00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:57.660
<v Speaker 5>it's just that this is something that</v>
<v Speaker 5>they started doing when they were young.</v>

726
00:31:57.870 --> 00:32:02.010
<v Speaker 5>They got really good at it and they see</v>
<v Speaker 5>it as a path to make career and they</v>

727
00:32:02.011 --> 00:32:04.290
<v Speaker 5>like thrills.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They like doing things dangerous and</v>

728
00:32:04.291 --> 00:32:07.470
<v Speaker 5>excitements and exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Some of them just accept the risks and</v>

729
00:32:07.471 --> 00:32:10.140
<v Speaker 5>some of them say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would rather live a dangerous life.</v>

730
00:32:10.141 --> 00:32:12.150
<v Speaker 5>That's exciting than a really fucking</v>
<v Speaker 5>boring.</v>

731
00:32:12.151 --> 00:32:14.910
<v Speaker 5>Like sitting on the couch atrophying.</v>

732
00:32:15.380 --> 00:32:17.540
<v Speaker 3>I can respect that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

733
00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:18.653
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course</v>

734
00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:20.070
<v Speaker 4>that's funny though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is like,</v>

735
00:32:20.150 --> 00:32:23.500
<v Speaker 4>was like going to like on Davinci's</v>
<v Speaker 4>podcasts and being like,</v>

736
00:32:23.650 --> 00:32:26.560
<v Speaker 4>I don't know about this art stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know about business</v>

737
00:32:26.810 --> 00:32:28.920
<v Speaker 3>can take it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you're right.</v>

738
00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:29.791
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're right.</v>

739
00:32:29.791 --> 00:32:32.430
<v Speaker 3>My perspective is when I see it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I now.</v>

740
00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:33.860
<v Speaker 3>Now you put it like that too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like what?</v>

741
00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:35.250
<v Speaker 3>What's the alternative?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Get A,</v>

742
00:32:35.790 --> 00:32:38.460
<v Speaker 3>get a job in a factory or get a job,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you die.</v>

743
00:32:39.050 --> 00:32:40.070
<v Speaker 5>This is temporary.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This</v>

744
00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:41.150
<v Speaker 2>is not going to last.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

745
00:32:41.151 --> 00:32:44.840
<v Speaker 2>So for them it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how am I going to use my meat vehicle?</v>

746
00:32:44.870 --> 00:32:46.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And am I going to use it for fun?</v>

747
00:32:46.710 --> 00:32:49.160
<v Speaker 2>Just go crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I mean that's a,</v>

748
00:32:49.161 --> 00:32:51.170
<v Speaker 2>that's the thought process behind it is</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

749
00:32:51.171 --> 00:32:52.790
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know I'm doing damage to it.</v>

750
00:32:52.791 --> 00:32:53.510
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

751
00:32:53.510 --> 00:32:57.050
<v Speaker 2>I know a lot of guys that have known</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they were in their prime where they</v>

752
00:32:57.051 --> 00:32:59.870
<v Speaker 2>were just killing everybody and now they</v>
<v Speaker 2>are broken.</v>

753
00:33:00.180 --> 00:33:02.990
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know guys who can't even brush their</v>

754
00:33:02.991 --> 00:33:05.450
<v Speaker 2>teeth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their shoulders are so shot.</v>

755
00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:08.150
<v Speaker 2>They have to like brush their teeth</v>
<v Speaker 2>lefthanded and they suck at it and the</v>

756
00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:11.610
<v Speaker 2>crazy fucking move their head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And how old are they in their thirties?</v>

757
00:33:12.510 --> 00:33:14.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is something about the human</v>

758
00:33:14.761 --> 00:33:17.970
<v Speaker 2>animal that wants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an interesting facet of humanity</v>

759
00:33:17.971 --> 00:33:21.000
<v Speaker 2>that wants to achieve greatness for some</v>
<v Speaker 2>reason.</v>

760
00:33:21.420 --> 00:33:26.420
<v Speaker 5>I will see the glory of winning in that</v>
<v Speaker 5>too is also directly related to the</v>

761
00:33:26.601 --> 00:33:30.080
<v Speaker 5>danger of doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like there's something dangerous</v>

762
00:33:30.081 --> 00:33:33.500
<v Speaker 5>about it that makes it super exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you pull it off,</v>

763
00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:36.040
<v Speaker 5>it's winning.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A fight is,</v>

764
00:33:36.190 --> 00:33:37.460
<v Speaker 5>it's a crazy feeling</v>

765
00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:41.590
<v Speaker 4>more than making all these other people</v>
<v Speaker 4>happy too because people have voted on,</v>

766
00:33:41.591 --> 00:33:43.000
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or how do you do it?</v>

767
00:33:43.001 --> 00:33:47.010
<v Speaker 4>You vote on them or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you bet on them.</v>

768
00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:49.900
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's so many people just.</v>

769
00:33:49.930 --> 00:33:53.560
<v Speaker 4>I've noticed so many people get their</v>
<v Speaker 4>mood is changed if their team wins.</v>

770
00:33:53.590 --> 00:33:54.423
<v Speaker 4>So it's like</v>

771
00:33:54.660 --> 00:33:59.400
<v Speaker 2>the problem with mma though I read when</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chuck Liddell started losing is when I</v>

772
00:33:59.540 --> 00:34:04.420
<v Speaker 2>realized like MMA is not a good sport</v>
<v Speaker 2>for like having to have your guy when</v>

773
00:34:04.820 --> 00:34:09.080
<v Speaker 2>eventually your guy will always lose</v>
<v Speaker 2>always because they'll get older.</v>

774
00:34:09.110 --> 00:34:13.760
<v Speaker 2>That's just the inevitable reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

775
00:34:13.761 --> 00:34:16.310
<v Speaker 2>The team dynamics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your team can always be a winner,</v>

776
00:34:16.490 --> 00:34:20.000
<v Speaker 2>but if you root for one fight or that</v>
<v Speaker 2>federal get old and the young people</v>

777
00:34:20.001 --> 00:34:23.360
<v Speaker 2>will come in and it's like 38.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's way old.</v>

778
00:34:23.990 --> 00:34:26.480
<v Speaker 2>Thirty eight is whale,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so like 32 or something.</v>

779
00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:31.500
<v Speaker 5>Especially now with drug testing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it used to be back in the day that when</v>

780
00:34:31.870 --> 00:34:34.600
<v Speaker 5>you would get tested,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was really like they would say it's</v>

781
00:34:34.601 --> 00:34:37.270
<v Speaker 5>like an intelligence test.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's more than a drug test,</v>

782
00:34:37.271 --> 00:34:42.250
<v Speaker 5>like just don't take anything the</v>
<v Speaker 5>remaining few days before your test and</v>

783
00:34:42.251 --> 00:34:45.010
<v Speaker 5>they just testing your pee for like</v>
<v Speaker 5>really obvious stuff,</v>

784
00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:48.550
<v Speaker 5>but now it's super comprehensive and</v>
<v Speaker 5>they use Usada,</v>

785
00:34:48.551 --> 00:34:53.260
<v Speaker 5>US anti-doping association and they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they fucking crawl up your ass with a</v>

786
00:34:53.261 --> 00:34:55.900
<v Speaker 5>microscope.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People wake you up checking for what</v>

787
00:34:55.901 --> 00:34:57.850
<v Speaker 5>people want.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

788
00:34:57.851 --> 00:35:00.400
<v Speaker 5>They are in the room.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Will look at your Dick because guys are</v>

789
00:35:00.401 --> 00:35:01.070
<v Speaker 5>used rubber dam.</v>

790
00:35:01.070 --> 00:35:03.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to Rehab when I was a kid so I</v>

791
00:35:03.471 --> 00:35:07.430
<v Speaker 2>know I knew all the tricks to wizard</v>
<v Speaker 2>eaters or you'd get your homie to piss</v>

792
00:35:07.431 --> 00:35:09.320
<v Speaker 2>into a bag and you'd have the bag in</v>
<v Speaker 2>your pocket.</v>

793
00:35:09.470 --> 00:35:11.610
<v Speaker 4>What kind of drugs are mma?</v>
<v Speaker 4>People doing?</v>

794
00:35:11.700 --> 00:35:12.600
<v Speaker 4>Steroids.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Steroids.</v>

795
00:35:12.630 --> 00:35:16.350
<v Speaker 4>Oh right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not like I know nothing about it.</v>

796
00:35:16.351 --> 00:35:17.580
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well that to make sense.</v>

797
00:35:19.220 --> 00:35:21.820
<v Speaker 4>Legal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they're all doing it.</v>

798
00:35:21.870 --> 00:35:23.550
<v Speaker 4>Why would they do it if it's illegal?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Joe?</v>

799
00:35:23.551 --> 00:35:28.000
<v Speaker 4>I got to say your impression of Natasha.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

800
00:35:28.060 --> 00:35:31.140
<v Speaker 4>No roles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you illegal drugs or.</v>

801
00:35:31.150 --> 00:35:32.690
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>now I'm horny.</v>

802
00:35:32.790 --> 00:35:33.623
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hold on.</v>

803
00:35:33.950 --> 00:35:37.050
<v Speaker 4>I just thought that people had a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

804
00:35:37.830 --> 00:35:41.370
<v Speaker 4>and that they wouldn't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you're saying they would all do it?</v>

805
00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:42.580
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not all.</v>

806
00:35:42.630 --> 00:35:47.030
<v Speaker 2>There is definitely a core group of</v>
<v Speaker 2>champions who have never thought about</v>

807
00:35:47.031 --> 00:35:49.670
<v Speaker 2>taking drugs and still don't have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>problem with steroids.</v>

808
00:35:49.671 --> 00:35:51.140
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Promo.</v>

809
00:35:51.160 --> 00:35:53.810
<v Speaker 2>Sarah is also.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that when one person starts doing it,</v>

810
00:35:54.050 --> 00:35:58.520
<v Speaker 2>the person beneath him either will lose</v>
<v Speaker 2>or has to be pressured to do it and so</v>

811
00:35:58.521 --> 00:35:59.410
<v Speaker 2>it creates this like,</v>

812
00:35:59.740 --> 00:36:04.520
<v Speaker 4>and sorry if people out there are upset</v>
<v Speaker 4>that I'm not a sports fan,</v>

813
00:36:04.830 --> 00:36:07.720
<v Speaker 4>I'm don't think about them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's just talk.</v>

814
00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:10.070
<v Speaker 4>Do you believe that's what's holding us</v>
<v Speaker 4>back?</v>

815
00:36:10.370 --> 00:36:11.550
<v Speaker 4>Don't sweat it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You do though?</v>

816
00:36:11.780 --> 00:36:13.010
<v Speaker 4>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I'm just like,</v>

817
00:36:13.310 --> 00:36:16.080
<v Speaker 4>sports are holding us back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that what you mean?</v>

818
00:36:16.090 --> 00:36:19.430
<v Speaker 4>Thinks he's doing a what's elevating us?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's holding us back.</v>

819
00:36:19.431 --> 00:36:24.080
<v Speaker 4>What's the elevator making sports like?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Our main thing I hate when sports are on</v>

820
00:36:24.081 --> 00:36:28.220
<v Speaker 4>in any sort of public establishment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's aesthetically okay.</v>

821
00:36:28.221 --> 00:36:33.221
<v Speaker 4>I want to tell yourself it's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't like when you see sports in an</v>

822
00:36:33.441 --> 00:36:35.060
<v Speaker 4>establishment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I find it depressing,</v>

823
00:36:35.180 --> 00:36:37.310
<v Speaker 4>depressing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what about law and order when you</v>

824
00:36:37.311 --> 00:36:39.630
<v Speaker 4>watched that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's like one notch down,</v>

825
00:36:39.790 --> 00:36:42.590
<v Speaker 4>but very depressing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>CSI.</v>

826
00:36:43.580 --> 00:36:46.690
<v Speaker 4>Pull the head off the carpet to the</v>
<v Speaker 4>head.</v>

827
00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:52.720
<v Speaker 2>For our Natasha I will say is a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>is extremely connected to aesthetics</v>

828
00:36:54.390 --> 00:36:55.830
<v Speaker 2>more than any human being I've ever met.</v>

829
00:36:56.150 --> 00:36:58.400
<v Speaker 4>I think tennis is a nice aesthetic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There you go.</v>

830
00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:00.340
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would.</v>

831
00:37:00.390 --> 00:37:01.860
<v Speaker 4>I was told that's a sport.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>

832
00:37:01.930 --> 00:37:04.790
<v Speaker 4>It's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think like a tennis match.</v>

833
00:37:04.791 --> 00:37:05.690
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could handle that.</v>

834
00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:08.150
<v Speaker 4>Why is that okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And like honestly because I like how</v>

835
00:37:08.151 --> 00:37:10.370
<v Speaker 4>they like how they dress.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What about basketball?</v>

836
00:37:10.470 --> 00:37:11.303
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

837
00:37:11.340 --> 00:37:13.820
<v Speaker 4>I hate those long stories.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

838
00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:18.880
<v Speaker 4>I don't like baseball or</v>
<v Speaker 4>darkness to play tennis.</v>

839
00:37:19.730 --> 00:37:21.920
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just a couple of chicks are really good</v>

840
00:37:21.921 --> 00:37:24.710
<v Speaker 4>at it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I think</v>

841
00:37:26.330 --> 00:37:29.990
<v Speaker 4>it's probably because I grew up and I</v>
<v Speaker 4>was always the last to get picked for</v>

842
00:37:29.991 --> 00:37:33.400
<v Speaker 4>sports,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so maybe that's why it was so totally</v>

843
00:37:33.410 --> 00:37:34.210
<v Speaker 4>want to go deep</v>

844
00:37:34.210 --> 00:37:36.070
<v Speaker 2>when I hug you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm always worried I'm going to break</v>

845
00:37:36.071 --> 00:37:36.500
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

846
00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:37.780
<v Speaker 2>you weighed like 80 pounds.</v>

847
00:37:37.810 --> 00:37:39.610
<v Speaker 4>I wish you a hundred and five.</v>

848
00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:42.290
<v Speaker 2>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You do not weigh 100 pounds.</v>

849
00:37:42.350 --> 00:37:43.790
<v Speaker 2>You Line Yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you do.</v>

850
00:37:45.660 --> 00:37:47.180
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not like that skinny.</v>

851
00:37:47.181 --> 00:37:47.570
<v Speaker 4>I'm just</v>

852
00:37:47.570 --> 00:37:50.530
<v Speaker 2>small.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She weighs 105 while we fuck and it's</v>

853
00:37:50.540 --> 00:37:52.560
<v Speaker 2>101.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not fucking I a five pound debt.</v>

854
00:37:53.510 --> 00:37:55.730
<v Speaker 2>I mean I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to mention that.</v>

855
00:37:55.731 --> 00:37:57.020
<v Speaker 2>I asked the test and I had to bring it</v>
<v Speaker 2>up,</v>

856
00:37:57.021 --> 00:37:58.440
<v Speaker 2>but it needs to be said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

857
00:37:58.450 --> 00:38:03.450
<v Speaker 2>I've got an Alonzo Bowden to have lots</v>
<v Speaker 2>of document for Alonzo and fingers.</v>

858
00:38:04.430 --> 00:38:06.090
<v Speaker 2>You about the sport?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

859
00:38:06.470 --> 00:38:07.191
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Excuse me.</v>

860
00:38:07.191 --> 00:38:09.200
<v Speaker 2>I don't like sports.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I also don't like video games.</v>

861
00:38:09.230 --> 00:38:12.050
<v Speaker 2>The only thing I watch is fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I literally don't watch sport.</v>

862
00:38:12.051 --> 00:38:13.250
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know the rules.</v>

863
00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:15.640
<v Speaker 2>Like you don't like any sport other than</v>
<v Speaker 2>MMA and boxing.</v>

864
00:38:15.890 --> 00:38:17.050
<v Speaker 2>I don't watch them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

865
00:38:17.060 --> 00:38:18.890
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know when they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>happening.</v>

866
00:38:18.950 --> 00:38:20.230
<v Speaker 2>Like when someone says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

867
00:38:20.231 --> 00:38:22.160
<v Speaker 2>just see the NBA championship game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like Oh,</v>

868
00:38:22.161 --> 00:38:22.994
<v Speaker 2>when was it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

869
00:38:23.030 --> 00:38:24.050
<v Speaker 2>it was last night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

870
00:38:24.051 --> 00:38:26.270
<v Speaker 2>You didn't watch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm the same as the thing.</v>

871
00:38:26.330 --> 00:38:29.750
<v Speaker 2>The only sport I watched his MMA and</v>
<v Speaker 2>have watched consistently since I was a</v>

872
00:38:29.751 --> 00:38:33.200
<v Speaker 2>kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his mma and then boxing very secondarily</v>

873
00:38:33.201 --> 00:38:35.050
<v Speaker 2>and that I can't get into kickboxing at</v>
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>

874
00:38:35.470 --> 00:38:36.250
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

875
00:38:36.250 --> 00:38:38.620
<v Speaker 6>Laurie?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've seen clips of everything.</v>

876
00:38:38.621 --> 00:38:41.410
<v Speaker 6>I don't know why I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I can't get into because I like him and</v>

877
00:38:41.411 --> 00:38:43.600
<v Speaker 6>made much more than boxing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But then you would think I would be more</v>

878
00:38:43.601 --> 00:38:45.070
<v Speaker 6>in the kickboxing and boxing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I'm not.</v>

879
00:38:45.190 --> 00:38:50.190
<v Speaker 4>Sports just seems like men exercising.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's funny.</v>

880
00:38:50.890 --> 00:38:53.500
<v Speaker 4>But like I just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I know it's more than that,</v>

881
00:38:53.540 --> 00:38:56.470
<v Speaker 4>but like if you saw opera,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'd probably be like,</v>

882
00:38:56.471 --> 00:38:59.920
<v Speaker 4>this just seems like fat people</v>
<v Speaker 4>screaming or screened opera.</v>

883
00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:01.300
<v Speaker 4>Do you like it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

884
00:39:02.370 --> 00:39:05.860
<v Speaker 4>I felt like it was just like antiquated</v>
<v Speaker 4>form of entertainment that I watch.</v>

885
00:39:05.890 --> 00:39:08.290
<v Speaker 4>I was super duper high when I went to</v>
<v Speaker 4>see you because I knew,</v>

886
00:39:08.291 --> 00:39:10.140
<v Speaker 4>I knew I had to see.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like,</v>

887
00:39:10.900 --> 00:39:13.090
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just I had to do a favor.</v>

888
00:39:13.330 --> 00:39:14.140
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

889
00:39:14.140 --> 00:39:15.520
<v Speaker 4>when I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I went to watch,</v>

890
00:39:15.521 --> 00:39:16.180
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>listen,</v>

891
00:39:16.180 --> 00:39:18.280
<v Speaker 4>I'm just kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bullies out of my fucking mind.</v>

892
00:39:19.270 --> 00:39:21.790
<v Speaker 4>But what's interesting is I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what I really started paying attention</v>

893
00:39:21.791 --> 00:39:26.791
<v Speaker 4>to was all the people in the audience</v>
<v Speaker 4>and there's like this class of people</v>

894
00:39:27.041 --> 00:39:31.390
<v Speaker 4>that probably live in Bel Air and</v>
<v Speaker 4>Beverly Hills and want to be seen at the</v>

895
00:39:31.391 --> 00:39:35.350
<v Speaker 4>opera and it's like a big deal to say</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're going to the opera and I was</v>

896
00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:37.300
<v Speaker 4>watching this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was like they can't possibly like</v>

897
00:39:37.301 --> 00:39:39.100
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like even if they like it,</v>

898
00:39:39.101 --> 00:39:40.570
<v Speaker 4>they don't like it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that they don't like it.</v>

899
00:39:40.571 --> 00:39:42.310
<v Speaker 4>Like people like the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's true.</v>

900
00:39:42.580 --> 00:39:43.570
<v Speaker 4>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're right.</v>

901
00:39:44.170 --> 00:39:47.890
<v Speaker 4>100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What he's saying is pretending to like</v>

902
00:39:47.900 --> 00:39:49.830
<v Speaker 4>there's a different level to what the</v>
<v Speaker 4>light.</v>

903
00:39:49.910 --> 00:39:52.700
<v Speaker 6>It's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like sophisticated entertainment.</v>

904
00:39:52.701 --> 00:39:54.650
<v Speaker 6>I mean like we went to the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>to the orchestra,</v>

905
00:39:54.651 --> 00:39:57.210
<v Speaker 6>the symphony recently.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I hated it.</v>

906
00:39:57.770 --> 00:39:59.780
<v Speaker 6>I've been,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I went to the symphony when I was a kid</v>

907
00:39:59.781 --> 00:40:01.940
<v Speaker 6>with my grandma.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She used to take me and there are some</v>

908
00:40:01.941 --> 00:40:02.990
<v Speaker 6>bangers,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>

909
00:40:03.560 --> 00:40:04.620
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know like Dun Dun,</v>

910
00:40:05.010 --> 00:40:07.900
<v Speaker 6>a Banger,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

911
00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:10.670
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that he was just in there like doing</v>

912
00:40:10.671 --> 00:40:12.890
<v Speaker 6>this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But we went to see,</v>

913
00:40:12.970 --> 00:40:13.850
<v Speaker 6>I don't even.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Who Was it?</v>

914
00:40:14.070 --> 00:40:17.600
<v Speaker 6>Mahler and you read the description,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Mahler and it's like laminations on</v>

915
00:40:17.601 --> 00:40:20.690
<v Speaker 6>death,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not a discord and not pleasant to listen</v>

916
00:40:20.691 --> 00:40:22.820
<v Speaker 6>to.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So we're going to go sit down for an</v>

917
00:40:22.820 --> 00:40:24.590
<v Speaker 6>hour and a half.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Performance of like something that in</v>

918
00:40:24.591 --> 00:40:27.410
<v Speaker 6>its description is like Natasha.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You didn't like it either,</v>

919
00:40:27.411 --> 00:40:27.860
<v Speaker 6>did you?</v>

920
00:40:27.860 --> 00:40:29.210
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and there was like a low.</v>

921
00:40:29.300 --> 00:40:31.520
<v Speaker 4>Moshe got in a fight with two different</v>
<v Speaker 4>elderly people.</v>

922
00:40:31.700 --> 00:40:36.590
<v Speaker 4>He tried to help this woman.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was walking in like double crutches.</v>

923
00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:37.930
<v Speaker 4>It's so old you can't</v>

924
00:40:38.090 --> 00:40:40.790
<v Speaker 6>imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like it's so old and so white.</v>

925
00:40:40.820 --> 00:40:43.400
<v Speaker 6>It's like unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can't believe it,</v>

926
00:40:43.500 --> 00:40:46.490
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I was walking in and this old man</v>

927
00:40:46.820 --> 00:40:51.820
<v Speaker 6>was a sitting down and he's like 85,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and so I told him he started to get up</v>

928
00:40:51.921 --> 00:40:53.180
<v Speaker 6>to let me throw it go,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you don't need to get up.</v>

929
00:40:53.181 --> 00:40:55.550
<v Speaker 6>I can kind of crawl around you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And he goes,</v>

930
00:40:55.790 --> 00:40:58.760
<v Speaker 6>we're not all as young as you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Some of us are gonna die soon.</v>

931
00:40:59.450 --> 00:41:00.830
<v Speaker 6>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

932
00:41:00.831 --> 00:41:03.990
<v Speaker 6>I'm trying to go.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I just read the wikipedia page.</v>

933
00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:04.550
<v Speaker 6>I go like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

<v Speaker 6>well I guess that's what we're here to</v>
<v Speaker 6>listen to.</v>

935
00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:07.850
<v Speaker 6>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and the guys,</v>

936
00:41:08.270 --> 00:41:13.270
<v Speaker 6>nothing iced me out and I sit there like</v>
<v Speaker 6>bored and the worst and it's got.</v>

937
00:41:13.670 --> 00:41:16.880
<v Speaker 6>It's the worst kind of symphony Mahler</v>
<v Speaker 6>because it always seems like it's ending</v>

938
00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:18.150
<v Speaker 6>it be like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Duh,</v>

939
00:41:18.151 --> 00:41:20.240
<v Speaker 6>Dun Dun Dun,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and you're like,</v>

940
00:41:20.241 --> 00:41:22.080
<v Speaker 6>cool,</v>
<v Speaker 6>let's get the fuck out of it.</v>

941
00:41:22.330 --> 00:41:23.090
<v Speaker 6>Done.</v>

942
00:41:23.090 --> 00:41:26.460
<v Speaker 4>Never got the old lady who yelled at you</v>
<v Speaker 4>and she almost fell down the stairs.</v>

943
00:41:26.461 --> 00:41:26.760
<v Speaker 4>Then as</v>

944
00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:30.030
<v Speaker 6>we were leaving,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was an old man and he was so feeble</v>

945
00:41:30.070 --> 00:41:34.640
<v Speaker 6>and and wobbly that I was staring at his</v>
<v Speaker 6>body like in my mind,</v>

946
00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:36.680
<v Speaker 6>you ever have this kind of situation</v>
<v Speaker 6>where you're like this,</v>

947
00:41:36.790 --> 00:41:38.960
<v Speaker 6>this is going to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this person's going to fall.</v>

948
00:41:39.020 --> 00:41:41.730
<v Speaker 6>I can feel it in my bones were way</v>
<v Speaker 6>before it happened</v>

949
00:41:43.270 --> 00:41:47.360
<v Speaker 6>in the steepest possible.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It would and I could feel it like if</v>

950
00:41:47.361 --> 00:41:49.040
<v Speaker 6>this guy's gonna fall,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's too feeble.</v>

951
00:41:49.041 --> 00:41:52.850
<v Speaker 6>He's too old to be ascending the stairs</v>
<v Speaker 6>and he sure enough does.</v>

952
00:41:52.851 --> 00:41:56.640
<v Speaker 6>He just starts to tip over and he goes</v>
<v Speaker 6>for it because I was already like</v>

953
00:41:56.720 --> 00:41:59.080
<v Speaker 6>looking at him.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I grabbed him by like the,</v>

954
00:41:59.160 --> 00:41:59.800
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

955
00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:02.210
<v Speaker 6>the top,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the collar and the bottom of his jacket</v>

956
00:42:02.211 --> 00:42:03.590
<v Speaker 6>and I just held him up,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

957
00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:06.050
<v Speaker 6>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And he fucking like,</v>

958
00:42:06.350 --> 00:42:10.430
<v Speaker 6>just like shoved me off of him,</v>
<v Speaker 6>gave me a dirty look and stormed off.</v>

959
00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:12.260
<v Speaker 6>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I just saved your fucking life.</v>

960
00:42:12.261 --> 00:42:15.530
<v Speaker 6>You all bitch wanted to go.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Maybe you want way to go.</v>

961
00:42:16.730 --> 00:42:20.050
<v Speaker 6>Listen to them all.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I listened to Mahler out depressing</v>

962
00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:21.620
<v Speaker 6>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 6>pretends he slips.</v>

963
00:42:22.120 --> 00:42:25.010
<v Speaker 6>Listen to his wife complaining about her</v>
<v Speaker 6>stool.</v>

964
00:42:25.670 --> 00:42:29.540
<v Speaker 6>I saw blood in my stool and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm just going to fall.</v>

965
00:42:29.570 --> 00:42:31.580
<v Speaker 6>You know my grandma Gloria.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So to good,</v>

966
00:42:31.581 --> 00:42:34.670
<v Speaker 6>steep angle,</v>
<v Speaker 6>my grandma said to me what he said to me</v>

967
00:42:34.730 --> 00:42:36.770
<v Speaker 6>on her deathbed,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like days before she died,</v>

968
00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:39.380
<v Speaker 6>she looked at me and she said,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if there is a god,</v>

969
00:42:39.410 --> 00:42:42.080
<v Speaker 6>he saves a worst part of your life for</v>
<v Speaker 6>the very end.</v>

970
00:42:43.270 --> 00:42:45.470
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>bye bye grandma.</v>

971
00:42:45.570 --> 00:42:48.060
<v Speaker 3>Thinking about that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I was like going into a like an</v>

972
00:42:48.061 --> 00:42:51.690
<v Speaker 3>old person's home seems so depressing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I would never want to do that to go</v>

973
00:42:51.691 --> 00:42:54.930
<v Speaker 3>away from your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your stuff in your house.</v>

974
00:42:54.960 --> 00:42:55.850
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

975
00:42:55.860 --> 00:42:57.810
<v Speaker 3>I'm just trying to think what's the best</v>
<v Speaker 3>way to go.</v>

976
00:42:57.811 --> 00:42:58.650
<v Speaker 3>I think it will be</v>

977
00:42:58.930 --> 00:43:03.720
<v Speaker 5>themselves in a home will alone when</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're super depressing too,</v>

978
00:43:04.020 --> 00:43:04.730
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

979
00:43:04.730 --> 00:43:07.030
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I lived in New York when I first moved</v>

980
00:43:07.031 --> 00:43:09.220
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I stayed with my grandparents in New</v>

981
00:43:09.220 --> 00:43:11.350
<v Speaker 5>Jersey and my grandmother had had an</v>
<v Speaker 5>aneurysm.</v>

982
00:43:11.380 --> 00:43:13.870
<v Speaker 5>They gave her 72 hours to live.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She lived 12 years.</v>

983
00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:15.010
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

984
00:43:15.100 --> 00:43:15.520
<v Speaker 5>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

985
00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:16.970
<v Speaker 3>It was over those 12 years.</v>

986
00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:20.310
<v Speaker 5>I was only there living with them for a</v>
<v Speaker 5>few months.</v>

987
00:43:20.311 --> 00:43:22.830
<v Speaker 5>I think I lived there for maybe five</v>
<v Speaker 5>months,</v>

988
00:43:22.831 --> 00:43:24.990
<v Speaker 5>six months,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it was bad.</v>

989
00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:26.700
<v Speaker 5>It was bad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like my grandfather,</v>

990
00:43:26.730 --> 00:43:30.060
<v Speaker 5>they had a nun or a non.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A nurse would come over and they would</v>

991
00:43:30.061 --> 00:43:32.850
<v Speaker 5>help,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but this like she would have horrible</v>

992
00:43:32.851 --> 00:43:34.170
<v Speaker 5>bedsores.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She couldn't move.</v>

993
00:43:34.171 --> 00:43:37.020
<v Speaker 5>She was paralyzed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She was completely vegetables.</v>

994
00:43:37.290 --> 00:43:40.400
<v Speaker 5>She would talk a little bit on your</v>
<v Speaker 5>teeth were falling out.</v>

995
00:43:40.450 --> 00:43:43.230
<v Speaker 5>They had all fallen out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She want to live at that point.</v>

996
00:43:43.231 --> 00:43:43.620
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

997
00:43:43.620 --> 00:43:44.000
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

998
00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:47.250
<v Speaker 3>but I do think like the two ways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the two main ways to die or like to have</v>

999
00:43:47.251 --> 00:43:49.230
<v Speaker 3>a death bed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that seems kind of glamorous</v>

1000
00:43:49.231 --> 00:43:52.150
<v Speaker 3>because then you could like call people</v>
<v Speaker 3>to you and give them wisdom and like</v>

1001
00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:53.910
<v Speaker 3>have last words.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1002
00:43:53.911 --> 00:43:55.740
<v Speaker 3>but if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you die in an accident,</v>

1003
00:43:55.741 --> 00:43:57.450
<v Speaker 3>then you never get to have any of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1004
00:43:57.720 --> 00:43:59.720
<v Speaker 3>You can't have those funny last year</v>

1005
00:43:59.750 --> 00:44:01.490
<v Speaker 6>or the third way.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What is the,</v>

1006
00:44:01.540 --> 00:44:03.520
<v Speaker 6>what is you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're a bit about your grandma and her</v>

1007
00:44:03.540 --> 00:44:06.490
<v Speaker 6>deathbed.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't remember the third.</v>

1008
00:44:06.910 --> 00:44:10.300
<v Speaker 6>The third way though is to go mad and to</v>
<v Speaker 6>shit your pants.</v>

1009
00:44:10.301 --> 00:44:12.100
<v Speaker 6>And two,</v>
<v Speaker 6>my grandmother didn't die like that</v>

1010
00:44:12.101 --> 00:44:12.940
<v Speaker 6>though.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's just the job.</v>

1011
00:44:12.970 --> 00:44:15.010
<v Speaker 6>My grandma did.</v>
<v Speaker 6>My grandma's great fear.</v>

1012
00:44:15.011 --> 00:44:19.570
<v Speaker 6>Her entire life was becoming a feeble</v>
<v Speaker 6>senile person that was to herself and of</v>

1013
00:44:19.571 --> 00:44:22.480
<v Speaker 6>course it came true because the only way</v>
<v Speaker 6>to avoid that is to have a heart attack</v>

1014
00:44:22.481 --> 00:44:23.380
<v Speaker 6>or an accident.</v>

1015
00:44:23.740 --> 00:44:25.440
<v Speaker 3>I feel bad that I say that about my</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nana.</v>

1016
00:44:25.441 --> 00:44:26.560
<v Speaker 3>It was just a dumb joke.</v>

1017
00:44:26.830 --> 00:44:27.341
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1018
00:44:27.341 --> 00:44:31.560
<v Speaker 5>they have assisted death now in</v>
<v Speaker 5>California and 11 people did it on the</v>

1019
00:44:31.560 --> 00:44:32.251
<v Speaker 5>day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's crazy.</v>

1020
00:44:32.251 --> 00:44:35.400
<v Speaker 5>Please.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My absolutely did in the first day,</v>

1021
00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:38.550
<v Speaker 5>which I absolutely believe in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean I think God damn it.</v>

1022
00:44:38.580 --> 00:44:42.240
<v Speaker 5>Why do we need to have people die of</v>
<v Speaker 5>natural causes when they're horribly</v>

1023
00:44:42.241 --> 00:44:43.074
<v Speaker 5>suffering?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And</v>

1024
00:44:44.550 --> 00:44:45.600
<v Speaker 5>that's a good question,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1025
00:44:45.601 --> 00:44:49.290
<v Speaker 5>It's like what is suffering?</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you are physically fine,</v>

1026
00:44:49.291 --> 00:44:51.660
<v Speaker 5>you have a 70 beats per minute resting</v>
<v Speaker 5>heart rate.</v>

1027
00:44:51.661 --> 00:44:54.320
<v Speaker 5>You have no cancer but you just five</v>
<v Speaker 5>pounds everyday,</v>

1028
00:44:54.390 --> 00:44:57.150
<v Speaker 5>five pounds deck every day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hating life.</v>

1029
00:44:57.360 --> 00:44:58.410
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's crazy.</v>

1030
00:44:59.010 --> 00:45:01.860
<v Speaker 6>In Scandinavia where they've had</v>
<v Speaker 6>euthanasia for a long time,</v>

1031
00:45:02.770 --> 00:45:07.620
<v Speaker 6>they started to accept that the person</v>
<v Speaker 6>who suffering from chronic depression</v>

1032
00:45:07.860 --> 00:45:12.060
<v Speaker 6>can opt out and take assisted suicide as</v>
<v Speaker 6>a means to escape their depression.</v>

1033
00:45:12.100 --> 00:45:15.080
<v Speaker 5>Isn't a part of the problem with pro,</v>
<v Speaker 5>with chronic depression,</v>

1034
00:45:15.100 --> 00:45:17.440
<v Speaker 5>like we don't know what they're feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like if you.</v>

1035
00:45:17.460 --> 00:45:19.000
<v Speaker 5>If like someone,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you have a broken arm,</v>

1036
00:45:19.001 --> 00:45:19.361
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

1037
00:45:19.361 --> 00:45:20.710
<v Speaker 5>I broke my arm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I kinda get it,</v>

1038
00:45:21.010 --> 00:45:23.530
<v Speaker 5>but if someone says I have chronic</v>
<v Speaker 5>depression,</v>

1039
00:45:23.531 --> 00:45:24.364
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

1040
00:45:24.820 --> 00:45:26.320
<v Speaker 5>what does it feel like?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

1041
00:45:26.321 --> 00:45:29.470
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what your depression is and</v>
<v Speaker 5>in your chronic depression might be</v>

1042
00:45:29.471 --> 00:45:31.270
<v Speaker 5>different than another person and</v>
<v Speaker 5>another person.</v>

1043
00:45:31.271 --> 00:45:34.060
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how do you know that it can't be turned</v>

1044
00:45:34.061 --> 00:45:37.000
<v Speaker 5>around with a pill or with exercise and</v>
<v Speaker 5>diet,</v>

1045
00:45:37.001 --> 00:45:40.900
<v Speaker 5>and if you did turn it around like I</v>
<v Speaker 5>have friends that were suicidal and now</v>

1046
00:45:40.901 --> 00:45:42.760
<v Speaker 5>they're super happy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's hard.</v>

1047
00:45:42.870 --> 00:45:44.880
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the problem is the main one of the main</v>

1048
00:45:44.881 --> 00:45:49.200
<v Speaker 3>tenants of depression is hopelessness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you can't feel at all hopeful,</v>

1049
00:45:49.201 --> 00:45:52.170
<v Speaker 3>how are you ever going to try to get</v>
<v Speaker 3>your way out?</v>

1050
00:45:52.250 --> 00:45:55.040
<v Speaker 6>Another strange thing about mental</v>
<v Speaker 6>illness in my experience,</v>

1051
00:45:55.041 --> 00:45:57.000
<v Speaker 6>and I have a lot of it in my family,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1052
00:45:57.650 --> 00:46:00.930
<v Speaker 6>and is that it always looks,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not always but it off,</v>

1053
00:46:00.931 --> 00:46:03.860
<v Speaker 6>except for schizophrenia and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Looks obviously like that person's sick</v>

1054
00:46:03.861 --> 00:46:06.890
<v Speaker 6>and can't help it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But with depression or alcoholism,</v>

1055
00:46:06.891 --> 00:46:10.520
<v Speaker 6>that kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It always feels like you could act</v>

1056
00:46:10.640 --> 00:46:13.490
<v Speaker 6>differently if you just tried a little</v>
<v Speaker 6>bit harder.</v>

1057
00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:16.430
<v Speaker 6>You could not be doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You could be less depressed.</v>

1058
00:46:16.431 --> 00:46:19.640
<v Speaker 6>You could go apply for a job,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you could get up a look at the front.</v>

1059
00:46:19.641 --> 00:46:22.220
<v Speaker 6>He has schizophrenia.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can see as impossible,</v>

1060
00:46:22.221 --> 00:46:25.940
<v Speaker 6>but it looks to the normal brain like</v>
<v Speaker 6>close enough to normal that they could</v>

1061
00:46:25.941 --> 00:46:30.941
<v Speaker 6>just change your circumstance if only</v>
<v Speaker 6>they tried harder and mental illness is</v>

1062
00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:35.000
<v Speaker 6>maybe the inability to try harder,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so it's very seductive to the normal</v>

1063
00:46:35.001 --> 00:46:39.710
<v Speaker 6>brain to think of mentally ill people is</v>
<v Speaker 6>like lazy or not trying to get better.</v>

1064
00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:43.570
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just think it's one of those very odd</v>

1065
00:46:43.630 --> 00:46:48.630
<v Speaker 5>things to quantify of almost impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I don't know what you're feeling,</v>

1066
00:46:49.270 --> 00:46:52.180
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and what is like what's normal for some</v>

1067
00:46:52.181 --> 00:46:53.430
<v Speaker 5>people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1068
00:46:53.431 --> 00:46:56.050
<v Speaker 5>and like some people are just ecstatic</v>
<v Speaker 5>all the time and like what,</v>

1069
00:46:56.051 --> 00:46:57.190
<v Speaker 5>what is normal for them.</v>

1070
00:46:57.340 --> 00:47:02.340
<v Speaker 6>And also the antidepressants are like</v>
<v Speaker 6>literally just a chemical experiment</v>

1071
00:47:02.471 --> 00:47:04.930
<v Speaker 6>with somebody's brain,</v>
<v Speaker 6>go tinkle this and do this.</v>

1072
00:47:04.980 --> 00:47:06.720
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know people who ever since they</v>

1073
00:47:06.721 --> 00:47:08.940
<v Speaker 3>started taking antidepressants,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's changed their life and their</v>

1074
00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:09.890
<v Speaker 3>lifestyle better.</v>

1075
00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:11.670
<v Speaker 6>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Have you ever taken either of you ever</v>

1076
00:47:11.671 --> 00:47:13.050
<v Speaker 6>taken an antidepressant?</v>
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>

1077
00:47:13.290 --> 00:47:17.370
<v Speaker 6>Someone gave me some adderall once.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's not similar bid on entity.</v>

1078
00:47:17.430 --> 00:47:20.300
<v Speaker 6>I was on it when I was a kid when I was</v>
<v Speaker 6>a 13,</v>

1079
00:47:20.310 --> 00:47:22.050
<v Speaker 6>12 year old media personality.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Changing,</v>

1080
00:47:22.140 --> 00:47:26.280
<v Speaker 6>I remember my brain doing things to me</v>
<v Speaker 6>that I didn't like physically.</v>

1081
00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:29.860
<v Speaker 6>Like I started to see things in the</v>
<v Speaker 6>horizon of my vision.</v>

1082
00:47:29.861 --> 00:47:31.270
<v Speaker 6>I started diff.</v>
<v Speaker 6>My,</v>

1083
00:47:31.510 --> 00:47:35.620
<v Speaker 6>I started to feel like less hungry.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I started to like see things in the</v>

1084
00:47:35.621 --> 00:47:37.370
<v Speaker 6>horizon of your vision,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1085
00:47:37.390 --> 00:47:40.090
<v Speaker 6>like actual apparitions,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not apparitions,</v>

1086
00:47:40.091 --> 00:47:40.660
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1087
00:47:40.660 --> 00:47:44.020
<v Speaker 6>like sort of like sort of hallucinogenic</v>
<v Speaker 6>fractal situations,</v>

1088
00:47:44.021 --> 00:47:46.450
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I started to see that and it just like I</v>

1089
00:47:46.451 --> 00:47:49.390
<v Speaker 6>could feel it tinkering with my brain.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I of course,</v>

1090
00:47:49.450 --> 00:47:53.920
<v Speaker 6>what was happening was I was getting</v>
<v Speaker 6>given antidepressants to combat,</v>

1091
00:47:53.921 --> 00:47:56.410
<v Speaker 6>like being a juvenile delinquent,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like Druggie,</v>

1092
00:47:56.500 --> 00:48:00.130
<v Speaker 6>and so it wasn't treated.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It wasn't treating thing that existed.</v>

1093
00:48:00.131 --> 00:48:01.950
<v Speaker 6>So a psychiatrist gave you this?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1094
00:48:01.990 --> 00:48:04.900
<v Speaker 6>I was all fucked up with psychiatrists</v>
<v Speaker 6>that is will give you,</v>

1095
00:48:05.020 --> 00:48:05.950
<v Speaker 6>that's the real problem,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1096
00:48:06.010 --> 00:48:07.420
<v Speaker 6>They'll give it to people that don't</v>
<v Speaker 6>need it.</v>

1097
00:48:07.440 --> 00:48:09.420
<v Speaker 3>That's what's happening with the opiod</v>
<v Speaker 3>crisis.</v>

1098
00:48:09.421 --> 00:48:10.790
<v Speaker 3>Like they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people just like,</v>

1099
00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:14.130
<v Speaker 3>they'll just give you oxycontin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it just seems so crazy.</v>

1100
00:48:14.350 --> 00:48:17.170
<v Speaker 6>It was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This doctor told me this weekend,</v>

1101
00:48:17.171 --> 00:48:22.171
<v Speaker 6>I was talking to a family member that's</v>
<v Speaker 6>a doctor that it takes eight days of,</v>

1102
00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:26.130
<v Speaker 6>of a regimen of,</v>
<v Speaker 6>of what's the drug in the,</v>

1103
00:48:26.131 --> 00:48:28.180
<v Speaker 6>in the car.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's one drug that the,</v>

1104
00:48:28.210 --> 00:48:30.970
<v Speaker 6>all the opiate addicts are getting</v>
<v Speaker 6>addicted to Oxycontin.</v>

1105
00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:33.010
<v Speaker 6>It's not oxycontin,</v>
<v Speaker 6>fentanyl,</v>

1106
00:48:33.400 --> 00:48:36.280
<v Speaker 6>fentanyl.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It takes me for dead eight days to get</v>

1107
00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:40.390
<v Speaker 6>hooked and a and a treatment regiment is</v>
<v Speaker 6>something like 12 days.</v>

1108
00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:45.590
<v Speaker 6>So it's like everybody that's given the</v>
<v Speaker 6>treatment regimen for regular pain is,</v>

1109
00:48:45.660 --> 00:48:48.550
<v Speaker 6>is having to kick it when they get off.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that's why.</v>

1110
00:48:48.820 --> 00:48:50.680
<v Speaker 6>That's why we've got a crisis that is</v>
<v Speaker 6>incredible.</v>

1111
00:48:50.681 --> 00:48:53.050
<v Speaker 6>That eight days in you're hooked.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's insane</v>

1112
00:48:53.170 --> 00:48:55.540
<v Speaker 5>because everybody who takes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you break your leg or something,</v>

1113
00:48:55.690 --> 00:48:57.280
<v Speaker 5>they give you fentanyl.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

1114
00:48:57.320 --> 00:48:58.650
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know why they give it to you.</v>

1115
00:48:59.410 --> 00:49:03.910
<v Speaker 5>Medical marijuana for a broken leg for</v>
<v Speaker 5>pain is real simple.</v>

1116
00:49:03.940 --> 00:49:05.050
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're saying it like you haven't</v>

1117
00:49:05.051 --> 00:49:07.750
<v Speaker 5>thought it through like that because</v>
<v Speaker 5>they make a lot more money selling you</v>

1118
00:49:07.751 --> 00:49:09.760
<v Speaker 5>something you can't get anywhere else.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Too naive.</v>

1119
00:49:11.740 --> 00:49:13.820
<v Speaker 3>It's not like the first rule of being a</v>
<v Speaker 3>doctor.</v>

1120
00:49:13.821 --> 00:49:14.654
<v Speaker 3>We're not going to hurt</v>

1121
00:49:15.340 --> 00:49:17.320
<v Speaker 5>relationships with pharmaceutical</v>
<v Speaker 5>companies.</v>

1122
00:49:17.350 --> 00:49:19.260
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so it's a standard appointment believe</v>

1123
00:49:19.300 --> 00:49:21.520
<v Speaker 5>that people are like that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there's also a bunch of doctors that</v>

1124
00:49:21.521 --> 00:49:24.100
<v Speaker 5>are ignorant to the actual positive</v>
<v Speaker 5>benefits of pot.</v>

1125
00:49:24.130 --> 00:49:25.870
<v Speaker 5>They have a negative association about</v>
<v Speaker 5>pot.</v>

1126
00:49:25.900 --> 00:49:28.690
<v Speaker 5>People don't smoke pot,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but also to get real.</v>

1127
00:49:28.750 --> 00:49:30.610
<v Speaker 5>Like if you have a compound fracture,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't.</v>

1128
00:49:30.670 --> 00:49:33.640
<v Speaker 5>What you need is more than medical</v>
<v Speaker 5>marijuana at least at first.</v>

1129
00:49:33.700 --> 00:49:35.510
<v Speaker 5>You don't agree with me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1130
00:49:35.620 --> 00:49:38.840
<v Speaker 5>you would take your phone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is your bones sticking out of your leg</v>

1131
00:49:39.310 --> 00:49:41.680
<v Speaker 5>and your parts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You pop it back in and what you.</v>

1132
00:49:41.710 --> 00:49:44.500
<v Speaker 5>What would you take?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Only once you get the cast on it,</v>

1133
00:49:44.501 --> 00:49:46.140
<v Speaker 5>you're fine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It just,</v>

1134
00:49:46.141 --> 00:49:48.310
<v Speaker 5>she just sit there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It sucks when you move,</v>

1135
00:49:48.340 --> 00:49:51.910
<v Speaker 5>but you don't have to take that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't have medical marijuana.</v>

1136
00:49:51.920 --> 00:49:56.020
<v Speaker 5>Supposedly they did a recent test and 93</v>
<v Speaker 5>percent of people with chronic pain</v>

1137
00:49:56.260 --> 00:49:58.480
<v Speaker 5>preferred marijuana over opiates.</v>

1138
00:49:58.620 --> 00:49:59.190
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can.</v>

1139
00:49:59.190 --> 00:50:03.720
<v Speaker 3>My mom has pain and like she's never</v>
<v Speaker 3>tried drugs and I just can't get her to</v>

1140
00:50:03.721 --> 00:50:04.231
<v Speaker 3>try.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1141
00:50:04.231 --> 00:50:07.950
<v Speaker 3>like there's such a stigma,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like she'd probably try phentenol before</v>

1142
00:50:08.010 --> 00:50:10.860
<v Speaker 3>because a doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a doctor said it was okay.</v>

1143
00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:13.920
<v Speaker 3>Then marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wish we could change the.</v>

1144
00:50:14.360 --> 00:50:19.300
<v Speaker 5>We are not a fan of pain pills.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I hear you reconstructed and I didn't</v>

1145
00:50:19.301 --> 00:50:20.810
<v Speaker 5>take anything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just.</v>

1146
00:50:21.340 --> 00:50:22.450
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not taking them.</v>

1147
00:50:22.530 --> 00:50:25.420
<v Speaker 5>We took marijuana though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Or Smoking Pot luck.</v>

1148
00:50:25.740 --> 00:50:28.040
<v Speaker 6>How much did you suffer?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's not that</v>

1149
00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:29.690
<v Speaker 2>bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just paint.</v>

1150
00:50:29.720 --> 00:50:30.553
<v Speaker 2>Depends on your.</v>

1151
00:50:31.180 --> 00:50:32.400
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the kind of pain that you just</v>

1152
00:50:32.401 --> 00:50:32.761
<v Speaker 5>go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

1153
00:50:32.761 --> 00:50:34.530
<v Speaker 5>well that's what that feels like.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

1154
00:50:34.531 --> 00:50:37.530
<v Speaker 5>now I know what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Back pain is one of the harder ones.</v>

1155
00:50:37.910 --> 00:50:42.180
<v Speaker 5>Like everything you do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a very overrated pain by the way.</v>

1156
00:50:42.210 --> 00:50:44.360
<v Speaker 5>It's nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like scratches.</v>

1157
00:50:44.390 --> 00:50:46.440
<v Speaker 5>It feels like.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know I've heard people say it hurt</v>

1158
00:50:46.441 --> 00:50:49.630
<v Speaker 5>more than anything in their life,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so your people are pussies,</v>

1159
00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:52.380
<v Speaker 5>doesn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Doesn't hurt them.</v>

1160
00:50:52.381 --> 00:50:54.340
<v Speaker 5>It just doesn't hurt that much.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It really just does.</v>

1161
00:50:54.360 --> 00:50:57.300
<v Speaker 5>It just absolutely does not hurt that</v>
<v Speaker 5>much.</v>

1162
00:50:57.420 --> 00:51:00.750
<v Speaker 5>There's spots where it's not comfortable</v>
<v Speaker 5>like bones,</v>

1163
00:51:00.751 --> 00:51:03.870
<v Speaker 5>like elbow bone when they go over the</v>
<v Speaker 5>elbow bone and oddly enough,</v>

1164
00:51:03.871 --> 00:51:05.550
<v Speaker 5>like right when they get close to your</v>
<v Speaker 5>chest,</v>

1165
00:51:05.551 --> 00:51:08.220
<v Speaker 5>that's painful,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but not childbirth.</v>

1166
00:51:08.460 --> 00:51:10.260
<v Speaker 5>There's fucking manageable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You just go,</v>

1167
00:51:10.261 --> 00:51:11.910
<v Speaker 5>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was like just.</v>

1168
00:51:12.270 --> 00:51:16.350
<v Speaker 5>I think a lot of it is just how you</v>
<v Speaker 5>think about the course and the fester.</v>

1169
00:51:16.720 --> 00:51:19.330
<v Speaker 2>What's the most painful?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does anyone know what the most painful</v>

1170
00:51:19.331 --> 00:51:22.450
<v Speaker 2>thing of human being can experiences?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's like?</v>

1171
00:51:22.451 --> 00:51:25.990
<v Speaker 2>The top threshold seems to be a compound</v>
<v Speaker 2>fracture is as bad as it gets,</v>

1172
00:51:26.020 --> 00:51:29.430
<v Speaker 2>but maybe I'm told I just seems awful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Broken.</v>

1173
00:51:30.040 --> 00:51:34.360
<v Speaker 2>Broken bones suck and broken.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A compound fractures is a broken bone</v>

1174
00:51:34.361 --> 00:51:36.370
<v Speaker 2>and in a horrible laceration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1175
00:51:36.390 --> 00:51:37.540
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess that's true.</v>

1176
00:51:37.810 --> 00:51:39.820
<v Speaker 2>I have a broken arm and it wasn't that</v>
<v Speaker 2>bad,</v>

1177
00:51:39.880 --> 00:51:41.500
<v Speaker 2>but burning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you're right.</v>

1178
00:51:41.530 --> 00:51:44.560
<v Speaker 2>Burning burning is one of the most</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely painful ones.</v>

1179
00:51:44.740 --> 00:51:46.180
<v Speaker 2>Burning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not burning to death.</v>

1180
00:51:46.210 --> 00:51:48.580
<v Speaker 2>I think that that's rough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that recovery process from.</v>

1181
00:51:48.760 --> 00:51:51.580
<v Speaker 2>Do you know that when burn victims are</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the hospital,</v>

1182
00:51:51.640 --> 00:51:54.970
<v Speaker 2>other burn victims,</v>
<v Speaker 2>random strangers go to them and talk to</v>

1183
00:51:54.971 --> 00:51:55.804
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1184
00:51:55.840 --> 00:51:59.480
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My friend Zack is that craiger who's</v>

1185
00:52:00.310 --> 00:52:01.360
<v Speaker 2>from the widest kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1186
00:52:01.361 --> 00:52:03.520
<v Speaker 2>and he's a successful actor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's on that show,</v>

1187
00:52:03.521 --> 00:52:04.360
<v Speaker 2>wrecked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1188
00:52:04.600 --> 00:52:09.160
<v Speaker 2>he told me he burned himself at a party</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the Caribbean and in the Caribbean</v>

1189
00:52:09.580 --> 00:52:12.760
<v Speaker 2>people would go visit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>burn victims from the Caribbean would go</v>

1190
00:52:12.761 --> 00:52:17.110
<v Speaker 2>visit him</v>
<v Speaker 2>because apparently the pain is so</v>

1191
00:52:17.111 --> 00:52:18.680
<v Speaker 2>intense and insane that they</v>

1192
00:52:19.750 --> 00:52:21.860
<v Speaker 5>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let me say this now before I forget.</v>

1193
00:52:21.890 --> 00:52:23.770
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people who love Steve.</v>

1194
00:52:23.771 --> 00:52:24.260
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Steve.</v>

1195
00:52:24.260 --> 00:52:25.071
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>did something.</v>

1196
00:52:25.071 --> 00:52:28.130
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what the fuck he did,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but on his instagram,</v>

1197
00:52:28.131 --> 00:52:30.020
<v Speaker 5>if you're going to denver this weekend,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Steve,</v>

1198
00:52:30.021 --> 00:52:33.620
<v Speaker 5>I was going to be in Denver.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He has horrible burns all over his body</v>

1199
00:52:33.950 --> 00:52:37.790
<v Speaker 5>and he's looking for some sort of an emt</v>
<v Speaker 5>to take care of him,</v>

1200
00:52:37.791 --> 00:52:40.940
<v Speaker 5>like someone to help him dress his</v>
<v Speaker 5>wounds because he's still going to do</v>

1201
00:52:40.941 --> 00:52:43.670
<v Speaker 5>his shows at the comedy works and</v>
<v Speaker 5>apparently it's going to.</v>

1202
00:52:43.671 --> 00:52:45.680
<v Speaker 5>You won't tell the story of what</v>
<v Speaker 5>happened to him,</v>

1203
00:52:45.710 --> 00:52:48.440
<v Speaker 5>but he put it because he wants to tell</v>
<v Speaker 5>it onstage,</v>

1204
00:52:48.680 --> 00:52:53.680
<v Speaker 5>but he put these images will put a video</v>
<v Speaker 5>of it up on instagram and his fucking</v>

1205
00:52:54.411 --> 00:52:57.780
<v Speaker 5>skin is falling off of his arm.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Really bad.</v>

1206
00:52:58.210 --> 00:52:59.390
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it looks really bad.</v>

1207
00:52:59.420 --> 00:53:00.590
<v Speaker 5>Don't do your show,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dude.</v>

1208
00:53:00.880 --> 00:53:02.990
<v Speaker 5>Want to say to Steve,</v>
<v Speaker 5>have you listen to this?</v>

1209
00:53:03.230 --> 00:53:06.770
<v Speaker 5>There's a new stem cell therapy that</v>
<v Speaker 5>they've created for people that have</v>

1210
00:53:06.771 --> 00:53:11.771
<v Speaker 5>burns where they spray stem cells all</v>
<v Speaker 5>over the burn and the healing time is</v>

1211
00:53:12.981 --> 00:53:15.860
<v Speaker 5>radically reduced as well as the</v>
<v Speaker 5>scarring.</v>

1212
00:53:15.861 --> 00:53:19.610
<v Speaker 5>The scarring is radically reduced.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So another thing we tend to look into</v>

1213
00:53:19.611 --> 00:53:20.010
<v Speaker 5>that</v>

1214
00:53:20.010 --> 00:53:25.010
<v Speaker 2>they put tilapia skin on the burner you</v>
<v Speaker 2>heard about this low fish scales on</v>

1215
00:53:25.770 --> 00:53:29.580
<v Speaker 2>apparently is one of the much so much</v>
<v Speaker 2>more healing than bandages.</v>

1216
00:53:30.300 --> 00:53:33.090
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it like creates this sort of,</v>

1217
00:53:33.270 --> 00:53:34.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>skin on skin healing and it did</v>

1218
00:53:34.960 --> 00:53:37.290
<v Speaker 2>apparently the doctors trying</v>

1219
00:53:37.720 --> 00:53:39.460
<v Speaker 5>prostitutes burn victims using fish</v>
<v Speaker 5>skin.</v>

1220
00:53:39.461 --> 00:53:42.550
<v Speaker 5>That's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to be okay.</v>

1221
00:53:43.120 --> 00:53:45.370
<v Speaker 5>He's going to be okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But he's gotta go to the Steevo</v>

1222
00:53:45.430 --> 00:53:50.260
<v Speaker 5>instagram page so you could see it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But this stem cell treatment is pretty</v>

1223
00:53:50.261 --> 00:53:51.970
<v Speaker 5>radical.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like they've shown people with third</v>

1224
00:53:51.971 --> 00:53:53.860
<v Speaker 5>degree burns.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They sprayed on them and in a couple of</v>

1225
00:53:53.861 --> 00:53:55.660
<v Speaker 5>days it's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's crazy.</v>

1226
00:53:55.661 --> 00:53:57.490
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like literally no scar.</v>

1227
00:53:57.491 --> 00:53:59.350
<v Speaker 5>No nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It just heals.</v>

1228
00:53:59.410 --> 00:54:00.620
<v Speaker 5>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1229
00:54:00.700 --> 00:54:01.471
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're,</v>

1230
00:54:01.471 --> 00:54:03.250
<v Speaker 5>we're in a new world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1231
00:54:03.430 --> 00:54:04.750
<v Speaker 5>not this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the next one.</v>

1232
00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:07.510
<v Speaker 5>The next one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did you take it off?</v>

1233
00:54:07.710 --> 00:54:08.740
<v Speaker 2>What about that one?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1234
00:54:08.741 --> 00:54:09.870
<v Speaker 2>that man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he took it down.</v>

1235
00:54:09.930 --> 00:54:11.940
<v Speaker 2>That's a video of him getting blood</v>
<v Speaker 2>poured on his face.</v>

1236
00:54:12.200 --> 00:54:14.220
<v Speaker 5>Took it down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whoa.</v>

1237
00:54:14.320 --> 00:54:18.820
<v Speaker 5>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was asking for people to come and see</v>

1238
00:54:18.821 --> 00:54:23.260
<v Speaker 5>him in Denver,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like all that stuff all over his body.</v>

1239
00:54:23.261 --> 00:54:26.650
<v Speaker 5>All those.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like he showed what that looked like.</v>

1240
00:54:26.710 --> 00:54:28.240
<v Speaker 5>Click on that because it just seems</v>
<v Speaker 5>like.</v>

1241
00:54:28.720 --> 00:54:29.471
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fuck.</v>

1242
00:54:29.471 --> 00:54:33.970
<v Speaker 5>This is one video that he had.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is not going to show anything,</v>

1243
00:54:34.270 --> 00:54:37.960
<v Speaker 5>but the next video he showed what's</v>
<v Speaker 5>going on under those bands</v>

1244
00:54:38.250 --> 00:54:39.500
<v Speaker 2>and it's horrific.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1245
00:54:39.570 --> 00:54:41.050
<v Speaker 2>maybe it got flagged.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's,</v>

1246
00:54:41.090 --> 00:54:42.920
<v Speaker 2>what's the most painful thing you've</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever experienced?</v>

1247
00:54:44.330 --> 00:54:47.790
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1248
00:54:47.850 --> 00:54:49.470
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I'm so lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about you?</v>

1249
00:54:49.900 --> 00:54:52.290
<v Speaker 2>You got nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your shoulder?</v>

1250
00:54:52.500 --> 00:54:55.320
<v Speaker 2>I'm a baby.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Her shoulder popped out in Hawaii and it</v>

1251
00:54:55.321 --> 00:54:57.650
<v Speaker 2>was painful though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was.</v>

1252
00:54:57.730 --> 00:55:01.080
<v Speaker 2>I just don't like getting blood drawn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt very weak as a man at that</v>

1253
00:55:01.081 --> 00:55:02.910
<v Speaker 2>moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She popped out of the ocean and her</v>

1254
00:55:02.911 --> 00:55:05.460
<v Speaker 2>shoulder was like separated body surfing</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was just like,</v>

1255
00:55:05.700 --> 00:55:07.950
<v Speaker 2>you did you get an Mri?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know what's going on?</v>

1256
00:55:08.070 --> 00:55:09.540
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like three years ago.</v>

1257
00:55:09.541 --> 00:55:10.990
<v Speaker 2>It was a dislocated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1258
00:55:11.020 --> 00:55:12.930
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But no tearing or anything like that.</v>

1259
00:55:13.300 --> 00:55:14.740
<v Speaker 2>I apparently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't feel the same.</v>

1260
00:55:14.820 --> 00:55:18.090
<v Speaker 2>Dislocated my shoulder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even know weird because I could</v>

1261
00:55:18.091 --> 00:55:21.480
<v Speaker 2>see it physically on her body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She doesn't have as much muscle as you,</v>

1262
00:55:21.660 --> 00:55:24.720
<v Speaker 2>but I was looking at her arm going like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what to do about that.</v>

1263
00:55:25.050 --> 00:55:28.260
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what I'm going to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess I could hoist her on my shoulder</v>

1264
00:55:28.261 --> 00:55:30.470
<v Speaker 2>and walk back because it was like there</v>
<v Speaker 2>was a wall.</v>

1265
00:55:31.230 --> 00:55:32.063
<v Speaker 2>It just popped back</v>

1266
00:55:32.710 --> 00:55:34.600
<v Speaker 5>posted.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like for some people you're supposed to</v>

1267
00:55:34.601 --> 00:55:39.040
<v Speaker 5>like lay them down and stretch their arm</v>
<v Speaker 5>or pull it out and then it'll fall back.</v>

1268
00:55:39.041 --> 00:55:39.310
<v Speaker 5>In.</v>

1269
00:55:39.310 --> 00:55:43.090
<v Speaker 2>The most I know about shoulder</v>
<v Speaker 2>dislocations is from lethal weapon,</v>

1270
00:55:43.620 --> 00:55:47.910
<v Speaker 2>so slam them up against the wall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do they throw it into yourself?</v>

1271
00:55:48.840 --> 00:55:51.610
<v Speaker 2>Just have loose shoulders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I know some girls who like every</v>

1272
00:55:51.611 --> 00:55:55.350
<v Speaker 2>time she has sex or like one out of five</v>
<v Speaker 2>times her shoulder becomes dislocate.</v>

1273
00:55:55.510 --> 00:55:57.450
<v Speaker 2>I'll be honest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe touched on some of the loosest</v>

1274
00:55:57.460 --> 00:56:00.790
<v Speaker 2>shoulders in the game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe those girls are just like drama</v>

1275
00:56:00.791 --> 00:56:01.660
<v Speaker 2>queens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1276
00:56:01.810 --> 00:56:04.370
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Always going like this and they just</v>

1277
00:56:04.420 --> 00:56:05.920
<v Speaker 2>like being hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whether fucking.</v>

1278
00:56:07.810 --> 00:56:10.150
<v Speaker 2>Can you imagine though how bad that</v>
<v Speaker 2>would be if you were fucking the girl</v>

1279
00:56:10.151 --> 00:56:12.000
<v Speaker 2>and her shoulder got dislocated?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1280
00:56:12.001 --> 00:56:14.500
<v Speaker 2>That was really bad or good or some</v>
<v Speaker 2>pads.</v>

1281
00:56:14.590 --> 00:56:16.320
<v Speaker 2>Solar pads.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some shoulders,</v>

1282
00:56:16.840 --> 00:56:18.550
<v Speaker 2>some football town support.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1283
00:56:18.670 --> 00:56:20.740
<v Speaker 2>I do that anyway just because I like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>more masculine woman,</v>

1284
00:56:20.741 --> 00:56:22.900
<v Speaker 2>so I liked her to be wearing big back</v>
<v Speaker 2>something with a</v>

1285
00:56:24.550 --> 00:56:28.690
<v Speaker 4>just like give her a little Tbi.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Traumatic booty injury,</v>

1286
00:56:31.420 --> 00:56:33.300
<v Speaker 4>jail.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so easy to go to jail now.</v>

1287
00:56:33.400 --> 00:56:34.750
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We should be in jail just for saying</v>

1288
00:56:34.751 --> 00:56:37.600
<v Speaker 4>this right</v>
<v Speaker 4>now so we can.</v>

1289
00:56:37.810 --> 00:56:39.310
<v Speaker 4>Aren't you glad to not be dating right</v>
<v Speaker 4>now?</v>

1290
00:56:39.340 --> 00:56:41.290
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It seems like a nightmare for everybody</v>

1291
00:56:41.291 --> 00:56:42.124
<v Speaker 4>to know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is.</v>

1292
00:56:42.180 --> 00:56:44.590
<v Speaker 4>It seems so scary.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you get lucky and find someone that's</v>

1293
00:56:44.591 --> 00:56:45.341
<v Speaker 4>awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's great.</v>

1294
00:56:45.341 --> 00:56:46.960
<v Speaker 4>It's a good time and it's fun and</v>
<v Speaker 4>exciting.</v>

1295
00:56:46.961 --> 00:56:49.580
<v Speaker 4>But most of the time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1296
00:56:49.670 --> 00:56:50.650
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember,</v>

1297
00:56:52.410 --> 00:56:54.970
<v Speaker 4>you know like now it's like if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>

1298
00:56:55.030 --> 00:56:58.090
<v Speaker 4>if a girl wants to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she can just say that she didn't consent</v>

1299
00:56:58.091 --> 00:57:01.290
<v Speaker 4>and you'd probably make them fun forms,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fill out forms,</v>

1300
00:57:03.190 --> 00:57:06.160
<v Speaker 4>but you didn't need forums.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think she'd have a stack of them next</v>

1301
00:57:06.161 --> 00:57:07.390
<v Speaker 4>to the bed just to let chicks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1302
00:57:07.391 --> 00:57:10.240
<v Speaker 4>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is like really casual.</v>

1303
00:57:10.650 --> 00:57:12.880
<v Speaker 4>Like they do that though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All these so many forms.</v>

1304
00:57:12.910 --> 00:57:15.800
<v Speaker 4>All these big stars do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They make you like instagram cruise.</v>

1305
00:57:16.110 --> 00:57:18.510
<v Speaker 6>Not like the beat,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there was a story about Justin Bieber</v>

1306
00:57:18.511 --> 00:57:20.640
<v Speaker 6>will make you like videotape yourself</v>
<v Speaker 6>saying like,</v>

1307
00:57:20.880 --> 00:57:23.370
<v Speaker 6>I'm of sound mind and body and I choose</v>
<v Speaker 6>to fuck Justin Bieber,</v>

1308
00:57:23.430 --> 00:57:24.061
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1309
00:57:24.061 --> 00:57:25.350
<v Speaker 4>that makes sense,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or whatever,</v>

1310
00:57:25.440 --> 00:57:29.550
<v Speaker 4>because he's fucking little skanks</v>
<v Speaker 4>allegedly and uh,</v>

1311
00:57:29.580 --> 00:57:31.590
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're probably trying to get over on</v>

1312
00:57:31.591 --> 00:57:33.450
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I would imagine if you're that</v>

1313
00:57:33.451 --> 00:57:35.700
<v Speaker 4>wealthy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you have to worry about everything</v>

1314
00:57:35.701 --> 00:57:39.450
<v Speaker 4>you do all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure there are a lot of guys who are</v>

1315
00:57:40.140 --> 00:57:42.270
<v Speaker 4>probably trying to take advantage of</v>
<v Speaker 4>girls,</v>

1316
00:57:42.390 --> 00:57:44.580
<v Speaker 4>so for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe there's more of that.</v>

1317
00:57:44.581 --> 00:57:46.830
<v Speaker 4>Maybe that's on the rise.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's bad for you.</v>

1318
00:57:46.850 --> 00:57:49.650
<v Speaker 4>Boy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I bet it's the same as it's always been.</v>

1319
00:57:49.651 --> 00:57:52.230
<v Speaker 4>There's always been creeps in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's always been creeps on both</v>

1320
00:57:52.231 --> 00:57:54.230
<v Speaker 4>sides.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is the thing is that there,</v>

1321
00:57:54.390 --> 00:57:56.370
<v Speaker 4>there's more creeps in the men's side.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's get real.</v>

1322
00:57:57.360 --> 00:57:59.040
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's more like there's more</v>

1323
00:57:59.180 --> 00:58:03.110
<v Speaker 6>psychos,</v>
<v Speaker 6>maybe more crazy people that you date,</v>

1324
00:58:03.111 --> 00:58:07.340
<v Speaker 6>but there's more predators that you as</v>
<v Speaker 6>there are more male predators than there</v>

1325
00:58:07.341 --> 00:58:09.800
<v Speaker 6>are female.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm sure there are female partners and</v>

1326
00:58:09.801 --> 00:58:12.650
<v Speaker 6>their cycle men,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but if we were to really do some number</v>

1327
00:58:12.651 --> 00:58:13.470
<v Speaker 6>crunching,</v>

1328
00:58:13.470 --> 00:58:15.030
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would imagine it's not even.</v>

<v Speaker 6>I've never had,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's 50 slash 50.</v>

1330
00:58:16.470 --> 00:58:20.640
<v Speaker 6>I've never had an experience that I was</v>
<v Speaker 6>actively scared and I've had experience</v>

1331
00:58:20.641 --> 00:58:22.170

<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1383
01:00:28.010 --> 01:00:32.030
<v Speaker 2>maybe I shouldn't say that because I</v>
<v Speaker 2>just blatantly telling him he didn't do</v>

1384
01:00:32.031 --> 01:00:32.520
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1385
01:00:32.520 --> 01:00:33.320
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He d,</v>

1386
01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:35.580
<v Speaker 2>She came onto him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's not say her name now.</v>

1387
01:00:35.590 --> 01:00:37.850
<v Speaker 2>I don't know who she is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's a comedian and I just figured</v>

1388
01:00:37.851 --> 01:00:39.170
<v Speaker 2>he'd want a shout out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at any rate,</v>

1389
01:00:40.730 --> 01:00:42.210
<v Speaker 2>he's a great comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

1390
01:00:42.330 --> 01:00:44.450
<v Speaker 2>he definitely avoided the punchline.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

1391
01:00:46.970 --> 01:00:48.060
<v Speaker 2>at any rate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

1392
01:00:48.350 --> 01:00:50.420
<v Speaker 2>he didn't hook up with her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She came onto him and he was like,</v>

1393
01:00:50.421 --> 01:00:51.590
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not feeling this.</v>

1394
01:00:51.620 --> 01:00:52.453
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thank you.</v>

1395
01:00:52.460 --> 01:00:53.570
<v Speaker 2>Went home,</v>
<v Speaker 2>went to bed,</v>

1396
01:00:53.780 --> 01:00:55.450
<v Speaker 2>a gay guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1397
01:00:55.820 --> 01:00:57.980
<v Speaker 2>and then she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she texted him like a week later was</v>

1398
01:00:57.981 --> 01:00:59.180
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just wanted to thank you for not</v>

1399
01:00:59.181 --> 01:01:01.640
<v Speaker 2>taking me home that night because I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>drunk.</v>

1400
01:01:01.700 --> 01:01:03.530
<v Speaker 2>It wouldn't have been consensual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would've been raped.</v>

1401
01:01:03.531 --> 01:01:04.540
<v Speaker 2>So thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just like,</v>

1402
01:01:05.890 --> 01:01:07.470
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how a lot of people want to</v>

1403
01:01:08.330 --> 01:01:12.200
<v Speaker 2>firmly established that though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that if you're an adult and you're</v>

1404
01:01:12.201 --> 01:01:14.570
<v Speaker 2>drinking and you have sex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's rape.</v>

1405
01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:16.760
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is hard though because you have to</v>

1406
01:01:16.761 --> 01:01:18.650
<v Speaker 3>understand being a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are so vulnerable.</v>

1407
01:01:18.651 --> 01:01:21.290
<v Speaker 3>Like men have more upper body strength.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We do have a whole.</v>

1408
01:01:21.291 --> 01:01:23.060
<v Speaker 3>And they have a thing that goes into the</v>
<v Speaker 3>whole.</v>

1409
01:01:23.150 --> 01:01:24.740
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're saying crazy things right now</v>

1410
01:01:24.741 --> 01:01:26.260
<v Speaker 2>that no one knows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1411
01:01:26.280 --> 01:01:29.390
<v Speaker 2>but it's like we drop that kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>knowledge.</v>

1412
01:01:29.450 --> 01:01:30.283
<v Speaker 2>You have to</v>

1413
01:01:30.420 --> 01:01:32.190
<v Speaker 3>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Imagine yourself if you had a whole</v>

1414
01:01:32.191 --> 01:01:34.800
<v Speaker 3>instead and you didn't have those</v>
<v Speaker 3>muscles and you were just walking</v>

1415
01:01:34.801 --> 01:01:35.634
<v Speaker 3>around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1416
01:01:35.690 --> 01:01:38.900
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is the idea that women or men are</v>

1417
01:01:38.901 --> 01:01:40.790
<v Speaker 2>afraid that women are going to laugh at</v>
<v Speaker 2>them?</v>

1418
01:01:40.820 --> 01:01:42.290
<v Speaker 2>Women are afraid men are going to kill</v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

1419
01:01:43.470 --> 01:01:45.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are both very different things.</v>

1420
01:01:45.530 --> 01:01:47.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's the reality is that just like</v>

1421
01:01:47.780 --> 01:01:51.740
<v Speaker 2>when you say there's like the equal</v>
<v Speaker 2>dispensation of predators on the side,</v>

1422
01:01:51.741 --> 01:01:52.281
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well no,</v>

1423
01:01:52.281 --> 01:01:53.200
<v Speaker 2>there really aren't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1424
01:01:53.350 --> 01:01:55.640
<v Speaker 2>That really is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said there's creeps in both sides.</v>

1425
01:01:55.830 --> 01:01:58.130
<v Speaker 2>Don't necessarily think it was equal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I mean is,</v>

1426
01:01:58.131 --> 01:02:00.860
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not trying to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't doing that to like I said that,</v>

1427
01:02:00.861 --> 01:02:03.550
<v Speaker 2>but I did probably was flippant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But my point is that,</v>

1428
01:02:03.750 --> 01:02:07.640
<v Speaker 2>that the world that women walk around in</v>
<v Speaker 2>is one where they fear that the worst</v>

1429
01:02:07.641 --> 01:02:10.520
<v Speaker 2>case scenario is they're going to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>kidnapped,</v>

1430
01:02:10.521 --> 01:02:11.241
<v Speaker 2>raped,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and murdered.</v>

1431
01:02:11.241 --> 01:02:14.720
<v Speaker 2>In our worst case scenario is usually is</v>
<v Speaker 2>not that.</v>

1432
01:02:14.830 --> 01:02:16.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well exactly the rate part in</v>

1433
01:02:16.911 --> 01:02:18.650
<v Speaker 2>particular.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of the time it's not that.</v>

1434
01:02:18.651 --> 01:02:20.280
<v Speaker 2>And if it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's also from a fucking</v>

1435
01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:21.420
<v Speaker 5>man from a dude.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1436
01:02:21.421 --> 01:02:24.360
<v Speaker 5>I mean I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had an argument with a guy who's a</v>

1437
01:02:24.540 --> 01:02:26.270
<v Speaker 5>men's rights activist about that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was like,</v>

1438
01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:29.280
<v Speaker 5>actually more men are raped and women</v>
<v Speaker 5>are stupid.</v>

1439
01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:31.320
<v Speaker 5>They're raped by men.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fuck.</v>

1440
01:02:31.490 --> 01:02:35.310
<v Speaker 5>You're just reinforcing the argument</v>
<v Speaker 5>against men.</v>

1441
01:02:35.340 --> 01:02:37.140
<v Speaker 5>That's like such a dumb argument.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1442
01:02:37.141 --> 01:02:38.850
<v Speaker 5>they always like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they haven't even looked into it.</v>

1443
01:02:38.851 --> 01:02:39.860
<v Speaker 5>They like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they like,</v>

1444
01:02:39.870 --> 01:02:43.590
<v Speaker 5>it's such a surface thing to say like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>have you done like the next step?</v>

1445
01:02:43.620 --> 01:02:44.820
<v Speaker 5>Like who's raping?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah,</v>

1446
01:02:44.821 --> 01:02:46.440
<v Speaker 5>guys probably shouldn't bring it up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1447
01:02:46.441 --> 01:02:47.460
<v Speaker 5>you should probably shouldn't bring it</v>
<v Speaker 5>up.</v>

1448
01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:49.320
<v Speaker 5>Do you want her to support men?</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you like.</v>

1449
01:02:49.321 --> 01:02:50.820
<v Speaker 5>Your whole thing is that men are</v>
<v Speaker 5>awesome.</v>

1450
01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.370
<v Speaker 5>Like men are actually.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The victims were raped more than women.</v>

1451
01:02:53.430 --> 01:02:54.263
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>By what?</v>

1452
01:02:54.420 --> 01:02:55.550
<v Speaker 5>Goblins.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's fucking.</v>

1453
01:02:56.010 --> 01:02:56.830
<v Speaker 5>Demons are coming</v>

1454
01:02:56.830 --> 01:03:00.450
<v Speaker 3>middle of the night and raping you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a good point by other men.</v>

1455
01:03:00.450 --> 01:03:04.290
<v Speaker 5>But this guy was saying it like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got you with this fact that I bet you</v>

1456
01:03:04.291 --> 01:03:05.124
<v Speaker 5>did know</v>

1457
01:03:05.460 --> 01:03:07.290
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>because people like to talk and talking</v>

1458
01:03:07.291 --> 01:03:08.180
<v Speaker 6>points.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They don't like to.</v>

1459
01:03:08.270 --> 01:03:08.980
<v Speaker 6>I mean</v>

1460
01:03:08.980 --> 01:03:11.380
<v Speaker 3>a lot of experience with the alt right</v>
<v Speaker 3>people on your show.</v>

1461
01:03:11.410 --> 01:03:13.750
<v Speaker 3>What's that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just that they don't think things</v>

1462
01:03:13.751 --> 01:03:14.890
<v Speaker 3>through.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like remember that guy was trying to</v>

1463
01:03:14.891 --> 01:03:16.840
<v Speaker 3>tell you that the people at the woman's</v>
<v Speaker 3>march,</v>

1464
01:03:16.841 --> 01:03:18.250
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how did they take off their,</v>

1465
01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:21.460
<v Speaker 3>their work and it's like it was on a</v>
<v Speaker 3>Saturday,</v>

1466
01:03:21.780 --> 01:03:22.613
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1467
01:03:22.760 --> 01:03:24.970
<v Speaker 6>Did we have this guy on the show?</v>
<v Speaker 6>That was like,</v>

1468
01:03:25.180 --> 01:03:28.190
<v Speaker 6>the problem is it was all out of work.</v>
<v Speaker 6>People that just,</v>

1469
01:03:28.330 --> 01:03:30.250
<v Speaker 6>I don't know about.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This was a talking point in the right</v>

1470
01:03:30.251 --> 01:03:32.770
<v Speaker 6>about the women's marches or just about</v>
<v Speaker 6>protests in general.</v>

1471
01:03:32.950 --> 01:03:35.830
<v Speaker 6>I don't know how these people are able</v>
<v Speaker 6>to have such privileged that they can</v>

1472
01:03:35.831 --> 01:03:37.690
<v Speaker 6>just take work off to go protest.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>

1473
01:03:37.691 --> 01:03:39.790
<v Speaker 6>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's a history of protest where</v>

1474
01:03:39.791 --> 01:03:41.920
<v Speaker 6>people strike.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's the whole idea.</v>

1475
01:03:42.130 --> 01:03:44.440
<v Speaker 6>But second of all,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the women's march in particular was on a</v>

1476
01:03:44.441 --> 01:03:46.890
<v Speaker 6>Saturday,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so it was this guy who is this guy named</v>

1477
01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:48.610
<v Speaker 6>kid named Lucian wind trich.</v>

1478
01:03:48.730 --> 01:03:51.790
<v Speaker 5>Now you were asking who is?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1479
01:03:52.320 --> 01:03:53.430
<v Speaker 6>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 6>All right.</v>

1480
01:03:53.490 --> 01:03:55.320
<v Speaker 6>Brian,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this reason I came to you because we</v>

1481
01:03:55.321 --> 01:03:58.440
<v Speaker 6>were trying to get a.</v>
<v Speaker 6>basically we did the show right?</v>

1482
01:03:58.530 --> 01:04:00.480
<v Speaker 6>And we started with cultural</v>
<v Speaker 6>appropriation.</v>

1483
01:04:00.481 --> 01:04:02.590
<v Speaker 6>We ended with the outright with meet the</v>
<v Speaker 6>outright.</v>

1484
01:04:02.620 --> 01:04:05.790
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so we were trying really hard to</v>

1485
01:04:06.420 --> 01:04:08.270
<v Speaker 6>really explore ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

1486
01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:10.590
<v Speaker 6>And I guess if there's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if there's one thing I realized in the,</v>

1487
01:04:10.591 --> 01:04:11.960
<v Speaker 6>in the wake of,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1488
01:04:12.230 --> 01:04:14.850
<v Speaker 6>we definitely triggered the outright</v>
<v Speaker 6>with that cultural appropriation thing.</v>

1489
01:04:14.851 --> 01:04:19.620
<v Speaker 6>People were very upset that we even</v>
<v Speaker 6>broached the topic without condemning it</v>

1490
01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:21.220
<v Speaker 6>essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I think there's.</v>

1491
01:04:21.240 --> 01:04:24.570
<v Speaker 6>There's one thing I realized in the wake</v>
<v Speaker 6>of all of the show is like,</v>

1492
01:04:24.660 --> 01:04:26.910
<v Speaker 6>there's one position I truly don't</v>
<v Speaker 6>respect.</v>

1493
01:04:27.150 --> 01:04:28.710
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I disagree with you,</v>

1494
01:04:28.711 --> 01:04:31.440
<v Speaker 6>therefore I won't listen to you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Fuck you.</v>

1495
01:04:32.050 --> 01:04:33.000
<v Speaker 6>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's really.</v>

1496
01:04:33.001 --> 01:04:35.200
<v Speaker 6>There's nothing about that that I have</v>
<v Speaker 6>any respect for.</v>

1497
01:04:35.260 --> 01:04:36.190
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I completely agree.</v>

1498
01:04:36.191 --> 01:04:40.950
<v Speaker 5>I think I want to know how you came to</v>
<v Speaker 5>that conclusion and oftentimes you could</v>

1499
01:04:40.951 --> 01:04:43.810
<v Speaker 5>find if you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean especially if you particularly</v>

1500
01:04:43.811 --> 01:04:47.320
<v Speaker 5>disagree with something someone says and</v>
<v Speaker 5>you thought your side through and you</v>

1501
01:04:47.321 --> 01:04:50.830
<v Speaker 5>talk to someone with an open mind,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can actually find like the holes in</v>

1502
01:04:50.831 --> 01:04:52.870
<v Speaker 5>their logic and it'll help you</v>
<v Speaker 5>understand.</v>

1503
01:04:53.230 --> 01:04:55.630
<v Speaker 5>Maybe you got some holes in your own</v>
<v Speaker 5>logic,</v>

1504
01:04:56.040 --> 01:04:57.440
<v Speaker 3>not aware of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

1505
01:04:57.850 --> 01:05:01.460
<v Speaker 3>Experiences they're drawing from to help</v>
<v Speaker 3>come up with their way of thinking.</v>

1506
01:05:01.520 --> 01:05:01.900
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1507
01:05:01.900 --> 01:05:05.260
<v Speaker 6>and I definitely exploring all those</v>
<v Speaker 6>topics found just what you're saying.</v>

1508
01:05:05.261 --> 01:05:09.160
<v Speaker 6>I found like the part of the gun</v>
<v Speaker 6>argument that I really fully wrapped my</v>

1509
01:05:09.161 --> 01:05:12.340
<v Speaker 6>brain and my heart around the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the pro gun second amendment right.</v>

1510
01:05:12.370 --> 01:05:15.280
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm still not like a wildly pro gun guy,</v>

1511
01:05:15.281 --> 01:05:19.420
<v Speaker 6>but I totally 100 percent this</v>
<v Speaker 6>understanding of where they were coming</v>

1512
01:05:19.421 --> 01:05:21.310
<v Speaker 6>from that I never had before.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That really,</v>

1513
01:05:21.311 --> 01:05:23.370
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a lot of the condemnation of the left is</v>

1514
01:05:23.380 --> 01:05:25.270
<v Speaker 6>that they condemn identity politics.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

1515
01:05:25.570 --> 01:05:27.130
<v Speaker 6>And really when it comes to second</v>
<v Speaker 6>amendment,</v>

1516
01:05:27.131 --> 01:05:31.300
<v Speaker 6>stuff it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And also the truth is the outright to.</v>

1517
01:05:31.330 --> 01:05:34.690
<v Speaker 6>It's also identity politics is just</v>
<v Speaker 6>identity politics and the reverse.</v>

1518
01:05:34.691 --> 01:05:36.790
<v Speaker 6>It's not like left this identity</v>
<v Speaker 6>politics,</v>

1519
01:05:36.791 --> 01:05:39.910
<v Speaker 6>it's more gun owner identity.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like in other words,</v>

1520
01:05:40.060 --> 01:05:42.460
<v Speaker 6>when you condemn a gun owner,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're,</v>

1521
01:05:42.490 --> 01:05:44.560
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the liberal thinker is going,</v>

1522
01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:46.150
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm condemning guns,</v>

1523
01:05:46.151 --> 01:05:48.610
<v Speaker 6>I'm condemning violence.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And what you don't understand is you're</v>

1524
01:05:48.611 --> 01:05:53.020
<v Speaker 6>condemning a person with their hearing</v>
<v Speaker 6>is you're calling them their identity.</v>

1525
01:05:53.080 --> 01:05:54.670
<v Speaker 6>They're the thing that makes them</v>
<v Speaker 6>passionate,</v>

1526
01:05:55.050 --> 01:05:59.230
<v Speaker 6>a illegitimate stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and based in ignorance and violence.</v>

1527
01:05:59.290 --> 01:06:01.270
<v Speaker 6>And of course a person's going to react</v>
<v Speaker 6>and go,</v>

1528
01:06:01.450 --> 01:06:04.000
<v Speaker 6>go fuck yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'll never listened to your argument.</v>

1529
01:06:04.210 --> 01:06:07.510
<v Speaker 6>If you start your argument by basically</v>
<v Speaker 6>telling them their whole lifestyle is</v>

1530
01:06:07.511 --> 01:06:08.344
<v Speaker 6>bullshit.</v>

1531
01:06:08.520 --> 01:06:10.950
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a real problem with the gun</v>

1532
01:06:10.951 --> 01:06:14.310
<v Speaker 5>ownership argument and one of the big</v>
<v Speaker 5>problems is the mass shootings,</v>

1533
01:06:14.311 --> 01:06:16.950
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everybody condemns mass shootings.</v>

1534
01:06:16.951 --> 01:06:18.600
<v Speaker 5>They're horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're terrifying,</v>

1535
01:06:18.660 --> 01:06:21.570
<v Speaker 5>and they only happen with most of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>time people with guns.</v>

1536
01:06:21.780 --> 01:06:25.200
<v Speaker 5>I mean we've had some situations</v>
<v Speaker 5>recently in Europe where people driving</v>

1537
01:06:25.201 --> 01:06:28.710
<v Speaker 5>over people with cars and there's a lot</v>
<v Speaker 5>of insane shit that's going on over</v>

1538
01:06:28.711 --> 01:06:31.470
<v Speaker 5>there with that and then people had been</v>
<v Speaker 5>stabbing people in some places,</v>

1539
01:06:31.890 --> 01:06:33.450
<v Speaker 5>but for the most part it's guns.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

1540
01:06:33.630 --> 01:06:37.230
<v Speaker 5>But my thought on it is always that it's</v>
<v Speaker 5>a mental health issue.</v>

1541
01:06:37.260 --> 01:06:39.750
<v Speaker 5>There are more guns in this country than</v>
<v Speaker 5>there are people.</v>

1542
01:06:39.840 --> 01:06:44.840
<v Speaker 5>So if you have 300 million guns and</v>
<v Speaker 5>every once a year or so one of these</v>

1543
01:06:45.151 --> 01:06:48.240
<v Speaker 5>things happens and you have this mass</v>
<v Speaker 5>shooting this horrible tragedy.</v>

1544
01:06:48.510 --> 01:06:51.270
<v Speaker 5>One of the most constant things,</v>
<v Speaker 5>his mental illness,</v>

1545
01:06:51.271 --> 01:06:55.440
<v Speaker 5>almost all those people are either on</v>
<v Speaker 5>psycho psychoactive medicine.</v>

1546
01:06:55.680 --> 01:06:59.670
<v Speaker 5>Either they're on some sort of anti</v>
<v Speaker 5>psychotic or an antidepressant or the</v>

1547
01:06:59.671 --> 01:07:02.250
<v Speaker 5>coming off of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They have a history of psychiatric</v>

1548
01:07:02.251 --> 01:07:03.260
<v Speaker 5>treatment,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a history of,</v>

1549
01:07:03.410 --> 01:07:05.280
<v Speaker 5>of illness,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of mental illness.</v>

1550
01:07:05.370 --> 01:07:08.610
<v Speaker 5>It's 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's almost 100 percent of people that</v>

1551
01:07:08.611 --> 01:07:12.960
<v Speaker 5>are like severely mentally ill.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We have horrible standards for mental</v>

1552
01:07:12.961 --> 01:07:16.080
<v Speaker 5>illness in this country for people just</v>
<v Speaker 5>being roaming around the street and a</v>

1553
01:07:16.081 --> 01:07:19.160
<v Speaker 5>lot of that came from Reagan when Reagan</v>
<v Speaker 5>let those people.</v>

1554
01:07:19.380 --> 01:07:21.600
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When they let those people loose,</v>

1555
01:07:21.601 --> 01:07:23.430
<v Speaker 5>that means people need fucking</v>
<v Speaker 5>treatment.</v>

1556
01:07:23.431 --> 01:07:25.410
<v Speaker 5>They need help.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a lot of them.</v>

1557
01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:27.730
<v Speaker 5>So a lot of people that are on</v>
<v Speaker 5>dissociatives,</v>

1558
01:07:27.740 --> 01:07:30.360
<v Speaker 5>they're on all these anti psychotic</v>
<v Speaker 5>medication.</v>

1559
01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:33.360
<v Speaker 5>They're fucked up man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like they real issues and then they can</v>

1560
01:07:33.361 --> 01:07:34.194
<v Speaker 5>get ahold of guns.</v>

1561
01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:37.380
<v Speaker 6>I agree with you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I also think there's a flaw in that</v>

1562
01:07:37.381 --> 01:07:41.820
<v Speaker 6>logic because the mass shootings didn't</v>
<v Speaker 6>start commensurate with the shutting</v>

1563
01:07:41.821 --> 01:07:45.240
<v Speaker 6>down of the mental health facilities in</v>
<v Speaker 6>California.</v>

1564
01:07:45.540 --> 01:07:46.770
<v Speaker 6>When did they.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

1565
01:07:46.771 --> 01:07:48.480
<v Speaker 6>they,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they seem to me to be a more.</v>

1566
01:07:48.540 --> 01:07:50.850
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Kent State obviously was the original.</v>

1567
01:07:50.890 --> 01:07:52.910
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Kent State was the National Guard.</v>

1568
01:07:53.120 --> 01:07:55.100
<v Speaker 6>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what was the loan in the tower in</v>

1569
01:07:55.270 --> 01:07:57.620
<v Speaker 6>Austin,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Texas in 10 states in Ohio.</v>

1570
01:07:57.621 --> 01:07:58.191
<v Speaker 6>Excuse me.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1571
01:07:58.191 --> 01:07:59.750
<v Speaker 6>That,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that was like the first,</v>

1572
01:08:00.110 --> 01:08:01.700
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the first big one.</v>

1573
01:08:01.701 --> 01:08:03.980
<v Speaker 6>But the modern phenomenon of the mass</v>
<v Speaker 6>shooting is,</v>

1574
01:08:04.420 --> 01:08:07.010
<v Speaker 6>it is a fairly modern one.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It feels like the last 20,</v>

1575
01:08:07.011 --> 01:08:07.844
<v Speaker 6>10,</v>
<v Speaker 6>20 years,</v>

1576
01:08:07.860 --> 01:08:09.420
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know that that guy in the tower was</v>

1577
01:08:09.421 --> 01:08:10.254
<v Speaker 5>mentally ill.</v>

1578
01:08:10.270 --> 01:08:12.070
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm not disagreeing with you at all.</v>

1579
01:08:12.071 --> 01:08:14.140
<v Speaker 6>That there's.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That mental illness is a huge part of</v>

1580
01:08:14.141 --> 01:08:14.974
<v Speaker 6>the pie.</v>

1581
01:08:15.080 --> 01:08:17.080
<v Speaker 5>You're saying the Reagan thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not saying the Reagan thing is,</v>

1582
01:08:17.090 --> 01:08:20.540
<v Speaker 5>is that 100 percent the reason for it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's a big part of why there are so</v>

1583
01:08:20.541 --> 01:08:23.090
<v Speaker 5>many mentally ill people that were</v>
<v Speaker 5>released in that time.</v>

1584
01:08:23.330 --> 01:08:24.890
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can remember when I was a kid because</v>

1585
01:08:24.891 --> 01:08:26.450
<v Speaker 5>my dad was talking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was like,</v>

1586
01:08:26.451 --> 01:08:28.340
<v Speaker 5>it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's like so many more homeless</v>

1587
01:08:28.341 --> 01:08:30.050
<v Speaker 5>people now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's someone and they're talking to</v>

1588
01:08:30.051 --> 01:08:31.280
<v Speaker 5>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're all fucked up.</v>

1589
01:08:31.460 --> 01:08:34.280
<v Speaker 5>We just abandon these human beings</v>
<v Speaker 5>because their brains aren't working.</v>

1590
01:08:34.290 --> 01:08:35.000
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The idea,</v>

1591
01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:38.060
<v Speaker 6>the idea was that Reagan shut down all</v>
<v Speaker 6>the mental health facilities in</v>

1592
01:08:38.061 --> 01:08:42.260
<v Speaker 6>California and the idea was that they</v>
<v Speaker 6>would be replaced by community centers</v>

1593
01:08:42.500 --> 01:08:45.110
<v Speaker 6>where each community,</v>
<v Speaker 6>each neighborhood would have like a</v>

1594
01:08:45.140 --> 01:08:47.870
<v Speaker 6>check and send out the check and centers</v>
<v Speaker 6>of course were never built,</v>

1595
01:08:47.871 --> 01:08:49.250
<v Speaker 6>so the people just hit the streets.</v>

1596
01:08:50.480 --> 01:08:52.040
<v Speaker 5>Fornia was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I thought it was when Reagan was</v>

1597
01:08:52.041 --> 01:08:53.030
<v Speaker 5>president.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I go,</v>

1598
01:08:53.080 --> 01:08:54.740
<v Speaker 5>it'd be changed the standards.</v>
<v Speaker 5>National,</v>

1599
01:08:54.770 --> 01:08:55.260
<v Speaker 5>national.</v>

1600
01:08:55.260 --> 01:08:56.280
<v Speaker 6>I could be wrong nationally,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1601
01:08:56.370 --> 01:08:57.870
<v Speaker 6>I could be wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was when he was president.</v>

1602
01:08:57.871 --> 01:09:01.290
<v Speaker 6>I might be wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I saw dark man made the check in.</v>

1603
01:09:01.420 --> 01:09:02.910
<v Speaker 6>They just didn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1604
01:09:02.911 --> 01:09:05.850
<v Speaker 6>what was the only thing I was saying</v>
<v Speaker 6>though was that it's.</v>

1605
01:09:06.180 --> 01:09:09.390
<v Speaker 6>There's something else happening in</v>
<v Speaker 6>America that's like almost feels</v>

1606
01:09:09.391 --> 01:09:13.170
<v Speaker 6>mystical or spiritual with it when it</v>
<v Speaker 6>comes to mass shootings because it's</v>

1607
01:09:13.171 --> 01:09:16.440
<v Speaker 6>like there are other countries with</v>
<v Speaker 6>mentally ill people that have access to</v>

1608
01:09:16.441 --> 01:09:19.190
<v Speaker 6>guns.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That and maybe it's that we,</v>

1609
01:09:19.300 --> 01:09:22.920
<v Speaker 6>that we have a less,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a lesser standard of care for mentally</v>

1610
01:09:22.921 --> 01:09:25.740
<v Speaker 6>ill,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but cal Canada also has people babbling</v>

1611
01:09:25.741 --> 01:09:27.720
<v Speaker 6>on the streets.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Although they have limited access to</v>

1612
01:09:27.721 --> 01:09:29.730
<v Speaker 6>guns.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's something else going on,</v>

1613
01:09:29.790 --> 01:09:32.250
<v Speaker 6>it feels like to me,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and that this is totally anecdotal and</v>

1614
01:09:32.251 --> 01:09:34.500
<v Speaker 6>just my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but feels like to me there's some thing</v>

1615
01:09:34.501 --> 01:09:37.830
<v Speaker 6>that we don't understand that it is of</v>
<v Speaker 6>course mental in this entity that is of</v>

1616
01:09:37.831 --> 01:09:41.550
<v Speaker 6>course access to guns and there's some</v>
<v Speaker 6>third thing that people don't really</v>

1617
01:09:41.760 --> 01:09:43.770
<v Speaker 6>can't put your finger on,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is like,</v>

1618
01:09:43.771 --> 01:09:46.620
<v Speaker 6>why is this happening here?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Why is it happening so much here?</v>

1619
01:09:47.540 --> 01:09:50.030
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it could be related to overpopulation.</v>

1620
01:09:50.300 --> 01:09:55.280
<v Speaker 5>He could be related to the sort of</v>
<v Speaker 5>established mindset of the American</v>

1621
01:09:55.281 --> 01:09:58.400
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like why are Canadian so much nicer when</v>

1622
01:09:58.401 --> 01:10:01.400
<v Speaker 5>they're connected to us?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you just like if you look at the</v>

1623
01:10:01.401 --> 01:10:03.440
<v Speaker 5>landmass,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's no real line,</v>

1624
01:10:03.441 --> 01:10:05.420
<v Speaker 5>but you go across the culturally.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1625
01:10:05.430 --> 01:10:06.740
<v Speaker 5>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're way nicer.</v>

1626
01:10:06.950 --> 01:10:08.510
<v Speaker 5>They're just nicer,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1627
01:10:08.511 --> 01:10:10.130
<v Speaker 5>and they're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they talk like us,</v>

1628
01:10:10.250 --> 01:10:12.860
<v Speaker 5>they look like us,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they pronounce a few words differently</v>

1629
01:10:13.190 --> 01:10:14.830
<v Speaker 5>and they're way nicer,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1630
01:10:14.840 --> 01:10:17.750
<v Speaker 5>and they don't get a lot of mass</v>
<v Speaker 5>shootings up there at super uncommon.</v>

1631
01:10:17.870 --> 01:10:19.820
<v Speaker 6>It's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean it's based on this.</v>

1632
01:10:19.880 --> 01:10:23.540
<v Speaker 6>I think it's about the connection of</v>
<v Speaker 6>America to its guns is based on.</v>

1633
01:10:23.541 --> 01:10:24.170
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

1634
01:10:24.170 --> 01:10:27.470
<v Speaker 6>it's a foundation mythology.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's religion in a weird way,</v>

1635
01:10:27.530 --> 01:10:29.030
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>The religion of America,</v>

1636
01:10:29.031 --> 01:10:30.050
<v Speaker 6>the greatest country on earth.</v>

1637
01:10:30.270 --> 01:10:30.901
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's based.</v>

1638
01:10:30.901 --> 01:10:33.210
<v Speaker 5>It's a lot of.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's based on fear means it's freedom</v>

1639
01:10:33.211 --> 01:10:37.470
<v Speaker 5>for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but a lot of like the tactical people,</v>

1640
01:10:37.500 --> 01:10:39.900
<v Speaker 5>like the people that are really,</v>
<v Speaker 5>really into what happens if somebody</v>

1641
01:10:39.901 --> 01:10:41.030
<v Speaker 5>breaks in and you've got to be ready to</v>
<v Speaker 5>go up,</v>

1642
01:10:41.160 --> 01:10:42.500
<v Speaker 5>pulled that gun out on two point two</v>
<v Speaker 5>seconds,</v>

1643
01:10:42.520 --> 01:10:43.301
<v Speaker 5>got to be able to Tink,</v>
<v Speaker 5>tink,</v>

1644
01:10:43.301 --> 01:10:44.640
<v Speaker 5>tink,</v>
<v Speaker 5>shoot targets.</v>

1645
01:10:44.641 --> 01:10:48.480
<v Speaker 5>I mean there's people that I know people</v>
<v Speaker 5>are good friends that practice that shit</v>

1646
01:10:48.510 --> 01:10:52.370
<v Speaker 5>all the time and if you break into their</v>
<v Speaker 5>house you are fucked because they're</v>

1647
01:10:52.380 --> 01:10:55.050
<v Speaker 5>ready and they're looking for it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They want people to break.</v>

1648
01:10:55.051 --> 01:10:57.650
<v Speaker 5>I know people were asking people police</v>
<v Speaker 5>break into my phone.</v>

1649
01:10:59.590 --> 01:11:03.210
<v Speaker 6>I took Natasha to shoot guns in</v>
<v Speaker 6>anticipation of this gun episode that we</v>

1650
01:11:03.240 --> 01:11:06.360
<v Speaker 6>did with the it so much I can't say I</v>
<v Speaker 6>love to do.</v>

1651
01:11:06.550 --> 01:11:07.960
<v Speaker 3>I will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got there and I thought I'd make a</v>

1652
01:11:07.961 --> 01:11:09.910
<v Speaker 3>joke because you have to pick your</v>
<v Speaker 3>little target.</v>

1653
01:11:09.911 --> 01:11:11.350
<v Speaker 3>So I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are there any trump?</v>

1654
01:11:12.670 --> 01:11:14.520
<v Speaker 2>I'm nudging her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Natasha,</v>

1655
01:11:15.260 --> 01:11:17.180
<v Speaker 2>we are not in the right area.</v>

1656
01:11:17.250 --> 01:11:19.350
<v Speaker 3>We got the Hillary's coming in next</v>
<v Speaker 3>week.</v>

1657
01:11:19.390 --> 01:11:21.370
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>real hillary.</v>

1658
01:11:21.390 --> 01:11:24.670
<v Speaker 2>That you could shoot me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he was just talking shit to her</v>

1659
01:11:24.671 --> 01:11:26.470
<v Speaker 2>for asking the trucks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1660
01:11:26.520 --> 01:11:31.520
<v Speaker 2>probably talk with a southern accent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a side of twice</v>

1661
01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:38.110
<v Speaker 3>and then we get in there and there's</v>
<v Speaker 3>people just like doing magazine rifles.</v>

1662
01:11:38.111 --> 01:11:39.610
<v Speaker 3>And then there's a guy going through</v>
<v Speaker 3>saying,</v>

1663
01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:40.960
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what was he saying?</v>

1664
01:11:40.970 --> 01:11:42.130
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no rapid fire,</v>

1665
01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:46.600
<v Speaker 3>rapid fire because they're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like these kids.</v>

1666
01:11:46.780 --> 01:11:49.180
<v Speaker 3>It was pretty crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like there weren't even dividers in</v>

1667
01:11:49.181 --> 01:11:50.170
<v Speaker 3>between us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh.</v>

1668
01:11:50.171 --> 01:11:52.150
<v Speaker 3>And then he was telling me how to work</v>
<v Speaker 3>the gun and I was like,</v>

1669
01:11:52.270 --> 01:11:54.100
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>make sure that your thumb doesn't go</v>

1670
01:11:54.101 --> 01:11:54.521
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1671
01:11:54.521 --> 01:11:55.420
<v Speaker 3>go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

1672
01:11:55.450 --> 01:11:55.781
<v Speaker 3>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wait.</v>

1673
01:11:55.781 --> 01:11:57.130
<v Speaker 3>Where is my thumb?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not supposed to go,</v>

1674

<v Speaker 3>will you please?</v>

1675
01:11:58.240 --> 01:12:00.930
<v Speaker 3>Because I know he didn't know motion had</v>
<v Speaker 3>no either way.</v>

1676
01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:05.960
<v Speaker 3>Go Laugh and pointed me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Motherfucker was this little little poof</v>

1677
01:12:06.281 --> 01:12:07.300
<v Speaker 3>over here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Scared too.</v>

1678
01:12:07.301 --> 01:12:09.740
<v Speaker 3>We did a one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know I did the.</v>

1679
01:12:09.900 --> 01:12:12.100
<v Speaker 3>We did what we had got like 50 rounds.</v>

1680
01:12:12.150 --> 01:12:12.691
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we bought,</v>

1681
01:12:12.691 --> 01:12:16.350
<v Speaker 2>we bought two cars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to buy the ammunition in like a</v>

1682
01:12:16.351 --> 01:12:20.250
<v Speaker 2>box you can't buy like all have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we bought two boxes thinking we'd be</v>

1683
01:12:20.251 --> 01:12:21.630
<v Speaker 2>there for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The training,</v>

1684
01:12:21.810 --> 01:12:24.680
<v Speaker 2>the training session was literally 10</v>
<v Speaker 2>seconds.</v>

1685
01:12:24.810 --> 01:12:26.610
<v Speaker 2>Thirty seconds on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Put your hand here,</v>

1686
01:12:26.611 --> 01:12:27.600
<v Speaker 2>put that there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1687
01:12:27.601 --> 01:12:28.470
<v Speaker 2>Here's your gun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go shoot.</v>

1688
01:12:28.490 --> 01:12:31.290
<v Speaker 2>And people are rapid firing and you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>surrounded by other people that got that</v>

1689
01:12:31.291 --> 01:12:32.850
<v Speaker 2>same safety briefing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1690
01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:33.780
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1691
01:12:34.250 --> 01:12:37.300
<v Speaker 2>and there's a celebrity wall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one celebrity Shiela booth,</v>

1692
01:12:38.460 --> 01:12:40.740
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is not what you want to see.</v>

1693
01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:42.540
<v Speaker 2>That's a weird one too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1694
01:12:43.380 --> 01:12:45.240
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I lied about being there.</v>

1695
01:12:46.220 --> 01:12:49.770
<v Speaker 2>It was a picture of him there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I shot the gun and she shot it and</v>

1696
01:12:49.771 --> 01:12:52.560
<v Speaker 2>then I shot it again and I'm feeling</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I gotta get Outta here.</v>

1697
01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:54.240
<v Speaker 2>Natasha was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to get it.</v>

1698
01:12:54.300 --> 01:12:58.260
<v Speaker 2>I just think it was a bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think every gun advocate or strong gun</v>

1699
01:12:58.261 --> 01:13:01.830
<v Speaker 2>person we've talked to since said about</v>
<v Speaker 2>that particular place,</v>

1700
01:13:01.831 --> 01:13:06.270
<v Speaker 2>like that's not a place to start.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a cool place to unsafe and so</v>

1701
01:13:06.271 --> 01:13:07.890
<v Speaker 2>we just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I think we picked the wrong place.</v>

1702
01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:10.500
<v Speaker 2>At any rate though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm thinking about these two boxes of</v>

1703
01:13:10.501 --> 01:13:11.550
<v Speaker 2>ammunition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1704
01:13:11.700 --> 01:13:15.840
<v Speaker 2>I can't go to the dude upfront because</v>
<v Speaker 2>he'll think I'm like a little bitch,</v>

1705
01:13:15.841 --> 01:13:16.470
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1706
01:13:16.470 --> 01:13:18.540
<v Speaker 2>I got all this ammo left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

1707
01:13:18.541 --> 01:13:20.160
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then she's like,</v>

1708
01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:20.941
<v Speaker 2>Natasha,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's like,</v>

1709
01:13:20.941 --> 01:13:22.320
<v Speaker 2>don't be an idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's get outta here.</v>

1710
01:13:22.530 --> 01:13:26.260
<v Speaker 2>So</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how I walk up to the front and I</v>

1711
01:13:26.270 --> 01:13:28.470
<v Speaker 2>swear I sold her out immediately.</v>

01:13:58.111 --> 01:13:59.250
<v Speaker 2>a gun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I gotta get Outta here,</v>

1726
01:13:59.251 --> 01:14:00.880
<v Speaker 2>but really I'm just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1727
01:14:01.320 --> 01:14:02.940
<v Speaker 2>as you well know you want to shoot all</v>
<v Speaker 2>night,</v>

1728
01:14:02.941 --> 01:14:07.110
<v Speaker 2>but the live now I'm going Italian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First time I ever shot one.</v>

1729
01:14:07.200 --> 01:14:10.010
<v Speaker 2>The first thing I felt when I went into</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1730
01:14:10.070 --> 01:14:12.100
<v Speaker 2>the area where put the ear plugs</v>

1731
01:14:12.100 --> 01:14:14.980
<v Speaker 5>on and you stand next to these people</v>
<v Speaker 5>and there was these little dividers,</v>

1732
01:14:14.981 --> 01:14:19.000
<v Speaker 5>the place that I went.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But when you hear that you feel so</v>

1733
01:14:19.180 --> 01:14:20.120
<v Speaker 5>vulnerable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1734
01:14:20.330 --> 01:14:21.250
<v Speaker 5>You feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whoa.</v>

1735
01:14:21.251 --> 01:14:23.100
<v Speaker 5>Like if that hits you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a wrap.</v>

1736
01:14:23.310 --> 01:14:24.640
<v Speaker 5>They not going to make it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1737
01:14:24.790 --> 01:14:27.280
<v Speaker 5>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got to ask you guys this before you</v>

1738
01:14:27.281 --> 01:14:29.650
<v Speaker 5>take off.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just see this trump thing,</v>

1739
01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:33.250
<v Speaker 5>the CNN thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're going after the kid who made the</v>

1740
01:14:33.251 --> 01:14:35.950
<v Speaker 5>meme heard it wasn't a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well this is the thing.</v>

1741
01:14:36.280 --> 01:14:40.120
<v Speaker 5>Jamille explained the whole thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it was a kid that they went after</v>

1742
01:14:40.510 --> 01:14:45.510
<v Speaker 5>who had made a video or made a meme,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but apparently the meme came from a</v>

1743
01:14:45.911 --> 01:14:50.860
<v Speaker 5>video and the video was made by someone</v>
<v Speaker 5>else other than this kid and they</v>

1744
01:14:51.340 --> 01:14:53.710
<v Speaker 5>essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They threatened to docs this kid,</v>

1745
01:14:53.950 --> 01:14:56.320
<v Speaker 5>they.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They said they reserve the right to</v>

1746
01:14:56.321 --> 01:15:00.760
<v Speaker 5>expose him and I already 15.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if that's been 100 percent</v>

1747
01:15:00.761 --> 01:15:01.310
<v Speaker 5>proven.</v>

1748
01:15:01.310 --> 01:15:03.290
<v Speaker 6>I don't know if it's been 100 percent</v>
<v Speaker 6>disproven,</v>

1749
01:15:03.291 --> 01:15:06.200
<v Speaker 6>but I just heard that that is a lie.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a lie.</v>

1750
01:15:06.260 --> 01:15:07.340
<v Speaker 6>The 15 year old</v>

1751
01:15:07.500 --> 01:15:10.290
<v Speaker 5>ness of this kid,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well I don't know if that's the case</v>

1752
01:15:10.291 --> 01:15:13.260
<v Speaker 5>because he's not actually 15.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's because now they're talking about a</v>

1753
01:15:13.261 --> 01:15:16.500
<v Speaker 5>different person who created the</v>
<v Speaker 5>original video that was turned into you.</v>

1754
01:15:16.650 --> 01:15:17.850
<v Speaker 5>Video,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Gif file,</v>

1755
01:15:18.580 --> 01:15:20.230
<v Speaker 6>trump body slamming the.</v>

1756
01:15:20.670 --> 01:15:21.600
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're saying that.</v>

1757
01:15:21.680 --> 01:15:22.020
<v Speaker 3>That's</v>

1758
01:15:22.020 --> 01:15:23.400
<v Speaker 5>so trump.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is what it is.</v>

1759
01:15:23.401 --> 01:15:28.200
<v Speaker 5>Trump was on the wwe and he did a thing</v>
<v Speaker 5>where he slammed to the ground and so</v>

1760
01:15:28.201 --> 01:15:30.270
<v Speaker 5>they're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They took that and put a truck,</v>

1761
01:15:30.300 --> 01:15:34.680
<v Speaker 5>a CNN head over the person's body who</v>
<v Speaker 5>trumps slammed to the ground and then</v>

1762
01:15:34.681 --> 01:15:35.560
<v Speaker 5>trump tweeted it</v>

1763
01:15:36.840 --> 01:15:38.610
<v Speaker 6>offensive.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Very inappropriate.</v>

1764
01:15:38.640 --> 01:15:40.740
<v Speaker 6>Very non-presidential.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Pretty fucking funny.</v>

1765
01:15:40.790 --> 01:15:41.623
<v Speaker 6>I mean I got</v>

1766
01:15:42.910 --> 01:15:46.790
<v Speaker 5>nothing compared to him talking about</v>
<v Speaker 5>that woman having plastic surgery and</v>

1767
01:15:46.791 --> 01:15:50.380
<v Speaker 5>saying that her face was bleeding badly</v>
<v Speaker 5>from the face lift.</v>

1768
01:15:50.620 --> 01:15:54.280
<v Speaker 5>That's just gross.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like that is something wrong with him.</v>

1769
01:15:54.400 --> 01:15:56.020
<v Speaker 5>That's so beneath anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's not,</v>

1770
01:15:56.040 --> 01:15:58.670
<v Speaker 5>that's not just beneath the president</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's beneath</v>

1771
01:16:00.670 --> 01:16:03.220
<v Speaker 6>it is something deeply wrong with him.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's getting worse.</v>

1772
01:16:03.221 --> 01:16:05.830
<v Speaker 6>He's going off these,</v>
<v Speaker 6>these on tissue right now.</v>

1773
01:16:06.010 --> 01:16:10.240
<v Speaker 6>Pressure probably getting mentally ill</v>
<v Speaker 6>at this point because the seventies</v>

1774
01:16:10.300 --> 01:16:12.790
<v Speaker 6>isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Isn't mental illness like your brain</v>

1775
01:16:12.791 --> 01:16:14.530
<v Speaker 6>chemistry changing and can you imagine</v>
<v Speaker 6>what would.</v>

1776
01:16:14.740 --> 01:16:17.580
<v Speaker 6>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when the outright came after me for for</v>

1777
01:16:17.620 --> 01:16:20.410
<v Speaker 6>the show,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I had this other realization which is</v>

1778
01:16:20.680 --> 01:16:24.550
<v Speaker 6>even people you don't respect if enough</v>
<v Speaker 6>people hate you,</v>

1779
01:16:24.640 --> 01:16:25.590
<v Speaker 6>it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>

1780
01:16:25.940 --> 01:16:30.940
<v Speaker 6>it's gotta affect on your brain and</v>
<v Speaker 6>imagine being Donald Trump where half of</v>

1781
01:16:31.991 --> 01:16:35.790
<v Speaker 6>the world or more is like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>fuck you all day every day.</v>

1782
01:16:35.950 --> 01:16:40.760
<v Speaker 6>Half the world.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Imagine a large number of people in the</v>

1783
01:16:40.760 --> 01:16:41.593
<v Speaker 6>Republican America.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Exactly,</v>

1784
01:16:41.620 --> 01:16:44.680
<v Speaker 5>but it's way more than half of America</v>
<v Speaker 5>now because there's a large number of</v>

1785
01:16:44.681 --> 01:16:47.350
<v Speaker 5>people in the Republican Party that are</v>
<v Speaker 5>criticizing.</v>

1786
01:16:47.351 --> 01:16:47.630
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It</v>

1787
01:16:47.630 --> 01:16:49.580
<v Speaker 3>makes me mad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that we called it the women's March</v>

1788
01:16:49.581 --> 01:16:52.640
<v Speaker 3>and that no one really gives it respect</v>
<v Speaker 3>for what it was because it was the</v>

1789
01:16:52.641 --> 01:16:57.500
<v Speaker 3>largest protest protest in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in our history of our lives was to an</v>

1790
01:16:57.530 --> 01:16:59.750
<v Speaker 3>anti,</v>
<v Speaker 3>basically an anti trump protest.</v>

1791
01:16:59.751 --> 01:17:03.710
<v Speaker 3>Like when that guy was elected and like</v>
<v Speaker 3>we should just be talking about that</v>

1792
01:17:03.711 --> 01:17:07.740
<v Speaker 3>more like that's never happened in our</v>
<v Speaker 3>lifetimes or our parents' lifetimes did</v>

1793
01:17:07.750 --> 01:17:08.840
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was that big of a.</v>

1794
01:17:09.380 --> 01:17:13.220
<v Speaker 3>because someone was being elected and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>just kinda gets pushed to the side.</v>

1795
01:17:13.250 --> 01:17:16.070
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm glad it's called the women's march,</v>

1796
01:17:16.071 --> 01:17:16.904
<v Speaker 3>but it's just like</v>

1797
01:17:17.030 --> 01:17:19.970
<v Speaker 6>basically that we.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The idea of it was marginalized in the</v>

1798
01:17:20.030 --> 01:17:22.490
<v Speaker 6>scope of those marginalized because they</v>
<v Speaker 6>called themselves a woman</v>

1799
01:17:22.520 --> 01:17:25.250
<v Speaker 3>smart maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know because it's such a huge</v>

1800
01:17:25.280 --> 01:17:27.470
<v Speaker 3>deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I mean it was so exciting to be a</v>

1801
01:17:27.471 --> 01:17:30.620
<v Speaker 3>part of that and you saw those pictures</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they weren't just in every city in</v>

1802
01:17:30.621 --> 01:17:32.930
<v Speaker 3>America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were in every city in the world.</v>

1803
01:17:33.110 --> 01:17:35.090
<v Speaker 3>That's how opposed we were.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That didn't happen.</v>

1804
01:17:35.091 --> 01:17:37.340
<v Speaker 3>When you know anyone who in our life</v>

1805
01:17:37.370 --> 01:17:39.570
<v Speaker 5>times,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's become kind of a reaction to a</v>

1806
01:17:39.571 --> 01:17:42.330
<v Speaker 5>president before.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Never wanted to talk about the CNN.</v>

1807
01:17:42.840 --> 01:17:46.620
<v Speaker 5>What's crazy is that CNN is becoming a</v>
<v Speaker 5>monster to fight a monster.</v>

1808
01:17:46.700 --> 01:17:49.140
<v Speaker 5>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they're threatening to dox people</v>

1809
01:17:49.141 --> 01:17:52.770
<v Speaker 5>that are making funny memes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I all that was was funny.</v>

1810
01:17:52.771 --> 01:17:56.850
<v Speaker 5>I mean nobody really thought that Donald</v>
<v Speaker 5>Trump was actually slamming the person</v>

1811
01:17:56.851 --> 01:18:00.650
<v Speaker 5>that is CNN that doesn't even have a</v>
<v Speaker 5>head that has a cnn for head and</v>

1812
01:18:01.660 --> 01:18:04.980
<v Speaker 5>feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Some reporter from CNN was going after</v>

1813
01:18:04.981 --> 01:18:07.350
<v Speaker 5>the person.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They track the person down on Reddit who</v>

1814
01:18:07.351 --> 01:18:08.880
<v Speaker 5>made the means.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Who gives a fuck?</v>

1815
01:18:08.881 --> 01:18:10.410
<v Speaker 5>Who made the memes?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what's crazy.</v>

1816
01:18:10.580 --> 01:18:13.390
<v Speaker 6>Meme itself isn't offensive.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The name itself is funny.</v>

1817
01:18:13.510 --> 01:18:15.040
<v Speaker 6>The offensive part,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if anything,</v>

1818
01:18:15.041 --> 01:18:17.680
<v Speaker 6>is that the president of the United</v>
<v Speaker 6>States thought it was appropriate to</v>

1819
01:18:17.681 --> 01:18:18.290
<v Speaker 6>retweet it.</v>

1820
01:18:18.290 --> 01:18:21.170
<v Speaker 5>It's more dumb than it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If it did offend me even slightly,</v>

1821
01:18:21.171 --> 01:18:23.180
<v Speaker 5>I saw him that he retweeted.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

1822
01:18:23.181 --> 01:18:24.650
<v Speaker 5>Huh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's my reaction.</v>

1823
01:18:24.720 --> 01:18:28.160
<v Speaker 6>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you are correct in my opinion that the</v>

1824
01:18:28.280 --> 01:18:33.280
<v Speaker 6>CNN in particular and the press in</v>
<v Speaker 6>general is as filled with warts,</v>

1825
01:18:34.700 --> 01:18:37.250
<v Speaker 6>not as filled with warts,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's filled with warts in the same</v>

1826
01:18:37.251 --> 01:18:38.260
<v Speaker 6>way that the funding</v>

1827
01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:43.320
<v Speaker 5>found Dick</v>
<v Speaker 5>joke to make joe that was the right joke</v>

1828
01:18:45.891 --> 01:18:50.891
<v Speaker 5>to make the right time didn't mean it</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you're there at the top there.</v>

1829
01:18:51.280 --> 01:18:55.180
<v Speaker 5>We would have such a laugh over this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We've got to sand them off before I see</v>

1830
01:18:55.181 --> 01:18:59.080
<v Speaker 5>the Mrs Farmer,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's not that.</v>

1831
01:18:59.081 --> 01:19:04.081
<v Speaker 5>It's this new realm that we're in where</v>
<v Speaker 5>these cable networks are struggling so</v>

1832
01:19:04.151 --> 01:19:08.740
<v Speaker 5>hard to get attention and they're</v>
<v Speaker 5>focusing on really crazy shit.</v>

1833
01:19:08.741 --> 01:19:13.120
<v Speaker 5>Like CNN had a bunch of people fired for</v>
<v Speaker 5>making up fake stories about Russia and</v>

1834
01:19:13.121 --> 01:19:17.470
<v Speaker 5>trump or not substantiating these</v>
<v Speaker 5>stories and making sure they're correct</v>

1835
01:19:17.471 --> 01:19:21.250
<v Speaker 5>before they released it and put it live</v>
<v Speaker 5>and so three people had to resign.</v>

1836
01:19:21.251 --> 01:19:23.410
<v Speaker 5>I think it was three CNNS not</v>
<v Speaker 5>struggling.</v>

1837
01:19:23.490 --> 01:19:26.680
<v Speaker 5>That's what they're struggling.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're down 20 percent and rating.</v>

1838
01:19:26.820 --> 01:19:31.820
<v Speaker 6>I thought CNN and MSNBC and some other</v>
<v Speaker 6>left leaning thing,</v>

1839
01:19:32.490 --> 01:19:36.570
<v Speaker 6>although I don't really consider CNN</v>
<v Speaker 6>left leaning is like at the top of the</v>

1840
01:19:36.571 --> 01:19:37.290
<v Speaker 6>charts now</v>

1841
01:19:37.290 --> 01:19:39.180
<v Speaker 5>what I read,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it might be bullshit,</v>

1842
01:19:39.210 --> 01:19:39.850
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1843
01:19:39.850 --> 01:19:41.400
<v Speaker 5>let's pull this up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>See if you could find out.</v>

1844
01:19:41.460 --> 01:19:44.370
<v Speaker 5>What I read was that CNN is down 20</v>
<v Speaker 5>percent since June,</v>

1845
01:19:44.520 --> 01:19:46.770
<v Speaker 5>and that Fox is actually up 20 percent.</v>

1846
01:19:48.170 --> 01:19:48.990
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>

1847
01:19:48.990 --> 01:19:51.060
<v Speaker 6>So lots of splits like typed and CNN</v>
<v Speaker 6>ratings.</v>

1848
01:19:51.061 --> 01:19:55.210
<v Speaker 6>It says chump is way off on cns ratings</v>
<v Speaker 6>being down and trump said,</v>

1849
01:19:55.520 --> 01:19:55.741
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

1850
01:19:55.741 --> 01:19:56.190
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I didn't.</v>

1851
01:19:56.190 --> 01:19:58.500
<v Speaker 6>I didn't hear it from trump.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I heard it from someone else was</v>

1852
01:19:58.501 --> 01:20:00.090
<v Speaker 6>probably parroting trump.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1853
01:20:00.091 --> 01:20:02.670
<v Speaker 6>we're all that there in lies the</v>
<v Speaker 6>problem.</v>

1854
01:20:02.671 --> 01:20:05.520
<v Speaker 6>We're all being wrapped filled with</v>
<v Speaker 6>misinformation from both sides.</v>

1855
01:20:05.970 --> 01:20:06.960
<v Speaker 6>Each side is so</v>

1856
01:20:08.010 --> 01:20:09.660
<v Speaker 2>in their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in their echo chamber,</v>

1857
01:20:09.661 --> 01:20:14.430
<v Speaker 2>but they all accept the left and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>right included all except the</v>

1858
01:20:14.460 --> 01:20:17.490
<v Speaker 2>information that they're getting as</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gospel truth that cannot be assailed by</v>

1859
01:20:17.491 --> 01:20:20.370
<v Speaker 2>the other side's facts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so nobody even knows what the truth</v>

1860
01:20:20.371 --> 01:20:22.770
<v Speaker 2>is anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody knows what the argument.</v>

1861
01:20:22.771 --> 01:20:24.450
<v Speaker 2>Even if they read it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's true.</v>

1862
01:20:24.810 --> 01:20:25.830
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so Fox News,</v>

1863
01:20:25.831 --> 01:20:27.450
<v Speaker 2>CNN,</v>
<v Speaker 2>MSNBC,</v>

1864
01:20:27.451 --> 01:20:31.620
<v Speaker 2>so trump is responsible for everybody</v>
<v Speaker 2>paying attention now driven by surgeons.</v>

1865
01:20:31.621 --> 01:20:33.960
<v Speaker 2>For the Rachel maddow show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Last word with Lawrence O'donnell.</v>

1866
01:20:33.961 --> 01:20:37.920
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea who that is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>MSNBC is up a whopping 86 percent in</v>

1867
01:20:37.921 --> 01:20:39.210
<v Speaker 2>local view.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Total viewers.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I think she's great.</v>

1872
01:20:44.090 --> 01:20:45.780
<v Speaker 2>I think she's based.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's just so good.</v>

1873
01:20:46.050 --> 01:20:50.280
<v Speaker 4>Incredibly smart.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tucker Carlson is a well dressed guy</v>

1874
01:20:50.281 --> 01:20:51.114
<v Speaker 4>with a great haircut,</v>

1875
01:20:51.210 --> 01:20:53.130
<v Speaker 2>good vibe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know where he is though,</v>

1876
01:20:53.390 --> 01:20:55.560
<v Speaker 2>but he is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is like this odd bridge between</v>

1877
01:20:55.561 --> 01:20:57.930
<v Speaker 2>reasonable people in right wing maniacs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

1878
01:20:58.080 --> 01:21:00.930
<v Speaker 4>He looked good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a bridge between reasonable people.</v>

1879
01:21:01.070 --> 01:21:02.780
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Compared to Hannity.</v>

1880
01:21:02.781 --> 01:21:04.750
<v Speaker 2>Sean Hannity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So much more reasonable than,</v>

1881
01:21:04.870 --> 01:21:07.340
<v Speaker 2>than just a dick though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the problem.</v>

1882
01:21:07.730 --> 01:21:09.470
<v Speaker 2>He's an.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's an asshole to the people he</v>

1883
01:21:09.471 --> 01:21:12.710
<v Speaker 2>interviews.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His whole thing is that he bombards them</v>

1884
01:21:12.711 --> 01:21:16.790
<v Speaker 2>with like kind of snide interviewing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that relentless,</v>

1885
01:21:16.791 --> 01:21:18.680
<v Speaker 2>snide interviewing until they make a</v>
<v Speaker 2>mistake,</v>

1886
01:21:18.681 --> 01:21:20.720
<v Speaker 2>deserve it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he brings up several posture is</v>

1887
01:21:20.750 --> 01:21:22.570
<v Speaker 2>people just for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because he knows that they're going to</v>

1888
01:21:22.580 --> 01:21:24.670
<v Speaker 2>say something stupid.</v>

<v Speaker 6>wasn't touched by my parents at any</v>

1936
01:23:20.381 --> 01:23:22.720
<v Speaker 6>point until I was nine years old and we</v>
