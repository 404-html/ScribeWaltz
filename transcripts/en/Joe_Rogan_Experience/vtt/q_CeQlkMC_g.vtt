1
00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:02.910
I have a lot of friends that are falling off crazies.

2
00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:11.140
Boom.
And we're live Nick Depaulo.
Yeah.
Good to see you my friend.

3
00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:13.390
I can't believe that Jim out there.
It's nice.
Right?

4
00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:16.870
With the Porsche parked next to it.
You gotta be able to work out where you work.

5
00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:20.000
If you do that,
you get more in next to your Porsche.
Yeah.

6
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.020
Too bad things at working out.
Well for you Joan.
See what you're doing.

7
00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:25.750
And I doing anything I'm going to front.

8
00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.440
So we were talking before the podcast and I said saved this cause it's
hilarious.

9
00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:31.450
Yeah.
Randy credico.
Yeah,

10
00:00:31.451 --> 00:00:36.451
it was a stand up comedian has been involved in this Roger Stone thing.

11
00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.890
Yes.
As you know,
Roger Stone this morning,
the FBI raided,
you know,

12
00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:44.890
took him out of his house in his pajamas and who I love by Roger Stone

13
00:00:44.891 --> 00:00:49.480
interviewed me on Info wars.
He used to love my radio show on Sirius.
Yeah.

14
00:00:49.481 --> 00:00:52.890
They asked him,
they asked me to get him on and I was like,
Eh,

15
00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.790
I think I'm going to duck that one buddy.
He's fucking eccentric and crazy.

16
00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.330
He's a loon.
Yeah.
And,
and so this is Randy and they,
they,

17
00:01:01.331 --> 00:01:05.910
they've known each other forever and are they friends while they were real,

18
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.390
all this shit started and uh,
oh,
it's fucking classic.

19
00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.090
Randy credit goes radical left.
He used to do,

20
00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.210
<v 2>did a,
um,
a comedy album years ago.
Yeah.</v>

21
00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.310
It was him and a bunch of other guys and it was all,

22
00:01:22.351 --> 00:01:23.820
it was all political.

23
00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.630
It was like five guys or three a few guys.

24
00:01:27.631 --> 00:01:31.360
I forget how many guys think Cremins was on it.
Oh,
sure.
It's critical.
Yeah.

25
00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:35.640
And uh,
maybe Jimmy tingle.
Yup.
Yeah.

26
00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:40.380
And they had like a whole thing they were doing almost like a,
like a tour,

27
00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:42.920
you know,
and it like super left wing

28
00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.100
<v 0>politically aware.
But this is fucking way back in the day.</v>

29
00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.850
I want to say this is the 90s.
They were doing this.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean,
he was,

30
00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.490
he was,
he was always funny.
I mean,

31
00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.880
I've watched him die every night at catch a rising star because he's,

32
00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.430
he'd be up there doing such inside political shit.

33
00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.280
He'd be talking about a bill that was passed that day on the floor or whatever

34
00:02:02.281 --> 00:02:02.790
the fuck,

35
00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.510
and the crowd will be staring at him and he had a hot Asian girlfriend and he'd

36
00:02:06.511 --> 00:02:10.050
be dying up there.
This is when I fell in love with them and he goes,
he goes,

37
00:02:10.051 --> 00:02:13.530
that's my girlfriend over there.
I taught her a forwards and English,

38
00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.820
not you crowd suck.

39
00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.060
I mean,
he was really fucking funny,
but so political and inside and accent.

40
00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.450
But he stayed at my apartment when I lived out here in la and he fucking like

41
00:02:27.451 --> 00:02:30.480
try to pick up my wife after I left.
I had to go on the road somewhere,

42
00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.300
but I still love him.
He's fucking crazy.
But he,

43
00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.060
he sent me a picture of him,

44
00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:41.330
a 2016 in front of the embassy in London where what's his name was?

45
00:02:41.701 --> 00:02:45.990
Held up a sign.
Really?
Yes.
And I'm like,
what the fuck is going on?

46
00:02:45.991 --> 00:02:47.010
What's he doing out there?

47
00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.800
And then all that shit came out about wiki leaks and stuff.

48
00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.210
So they thought he might've been the intermediary.
Yeah.

49
00:02:54.211 --> 00:02:55.960
So he's gone in front of Roger Stone,

50
00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.320
gone in front of model or a couple of times and,
and uh,

51
00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.620
so there it is right here.
Who is Randy credico

52
00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:09.040
threatened to take away apartment,
uh,
Sochi.
His dog,
if he cooperated with Russia,

53
00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.490
investigate what he threatened to take away his dog.
Oh,

54
00:03:12.491 --> 00:03:14.950
fucking you gotta to read the texts that Roger Stone,

55
00:03:14.951 --> 00:03:18.520
they're public I think would send to Randy.
I'm going to take your dog.
Oh yeah.

56
00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:23.240
He goes,
let's get it on.
Beat the prayer to die.
I'm going to take your fucking,

57
00:03:23.241 --> 00:03:24.074
that's why I love this guy.

58
00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.020
This guy had a Nixon Tattoo when he was 18 on his back.
I just don't do it.

59
00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.100
He marched in the gay parade in New York.
I fucking love him.
He's nuts.

60
00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.960
Why do marching and getting creative in New York?
Just pro gay,
right?
Well,

61
00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:38.260
he's pro just,
yeah.
You know,
so he's just all over the place.

62
00:03:38.261 --> 00:03:41.370
He's all over the place,
but he's a right,
I mean,
get a Nixon Tac toe,

63
00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.600
right fucking right wing.
But uh,
all the right wing people to get a look at this.

64
00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:51.130
That is so ridiculous.
The fucking mix it,
that's a good tattoo too.

65
00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.640
I never did that.
And I got 60 something years old,
but at least,

66
00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:59.400
and he loved my radio show on Sirius and,
and he,
uh,
he did,
he hosted info was,

67
00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:00.430
it was about six months ago.

68
00:04:00.431 --> 00:04:04.150
He had me on as a guest when I got punched in the face by that broad oh,

69
00:04:04.151 --> 00:04:08.530
that's right.
I forgot about.
So,
uh,
so yeah,
they rated the FBI,
raided his house,

70
00:04:08.531 --> 00:04:12.280
took him out today and that he got out on to $250,000 bond.

71
00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:16.510
And um,
he,
he wanted credit co,
you know,

72
00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:18.580
to stop contesting what,

73
00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.120
what stone said in front of when he testified.

74
00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.290
So Coco said that's not how it went down by bus.

75
00:04:25.291 --> 00:04:30.100
So they are fighting and shit and then he's threatening them.
And um,
but uh,
yeah,

76
00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.330
I Randy,
so I text Randy today.
I go,
I'm doing Rogan.
I mean,

77
00:04:34.331 --> 00:04:38.140
if you want to walk away.
And he's like,
well,
call me before the show,
let me know.

78
00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.330
He goes,
there's not too much I can say right now.

79
00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:45.450
But what's funny is I know both these guys that is so weird and he said,

80
00:04:45.911 --> 00:04:47.230
yeah,
let me know.
He goes,

81
00:04:47.231 --> 00:04:51.200
I can't say much because they just just arrested the FBI.
They you,

82
00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:53.950
they're going to turn.
They try to,
I see what Paula is doing.

83
00:04:53.951 --> 00:04:57.010
He's turning Roger Stone against Trump.
Trump is the target,

84
00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:58.960
so he's going to threaten him with it.
You know,

85
00:04:58.961 --> 00:05:02.350
he's 60 something years old so he could spend the rest of his life in prison or

86
00:05:02.351 --> 00:05:06.910
talk,
you know,
he's doing that with every,
he's a scary guy.
Mahler.
If he,

87
00:05:06.911 --> 00:05:10.180
if you had a problem and that guy was coming after,

88
00:05:10.181 --> 00:05:13.210
you shouldn't get mad at God because he's going to do it slow.

89
00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:17.020
Like by the time this actually gets handled,
Trump,
he's going to be,

90
00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:19.330
I don't think they do that slow.
They do.

91
00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:23.800
I think that's different than anyway.

92
00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:29.290
I'm very confused by the time they get to Trump.
He's already so nerve racked,

93
00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:32.740
you know what I'm saying?
Because he liked chips away at his borders,

94
00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:36.930
like slowly but surely takes away all the people around him.
Yeah.

95
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.840
He gets closer and you know,
you know,
you know he's concentrating on the family,

96
00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:43.780
you know.
Well,
of course,
of course.
Of course.
That's what he does.

97
00:05:43.781 --> 00:05:46.120
And even does that with people like stone.

98
00:05:46.121 --> 00:05:49.510
He'll go after your family and stuff and you notice you never hear a word out of

99
00:05:49.511 --> 00:05:54.010
Ivanka anymore.
No,
exactly.
Yeah,
yeah.
Guarantee you,

100
00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:56.080
guarantee you they scared the fuck out of her.

101
00:05:56.081 --> 00:05:58.070
But if you want to know about Mala,
like you said and how

102
00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:59.480
<v 3>fucking creepy he is,</v>

103
00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:03.200
he was the head of the FBI during the eighties of the Whitey Bulger Shit went

104
00:06:03.201 --> 00:06:07.850
down and he put four guys in it.
Listen to this,
Joe,
and this,

105
00:06:07.851 --> 00:06:10.070
you can look this up.
This isn't me.
Four guys,

106
00:06:10.071 --> 00:06:15.071
he put in prison and wrongly it turns out two of them died in prison.

107
00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:19.030
Whoa.
Yeah.
You can go go because of Bulger.

108
00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:23.240
And it had to do with that because they would do things in the FBI would let

109
00:06:23.241 --> 00:06:26.180
them get away with it because they were providing informations.
Right.

110
00:06:26.181 --> 00:06:30.260
That was the whole,
exactly right.
And he fought.
Two guys died in prison.

111
00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:33.570
Wrongly,
by the way,
this guy's not a fucking good guy.
No,

112
00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:37.610
he's a marine and decorated marine and shit.
They make those sacrifices.

113
00:06:37.611 --> 00:06:41.120
They make those decisions where they're just going to like help a person who is

114
00:06:41.121 --> 00:06:44.900
a criminal because they're criminals providing information that can allow them

115
00:06:44.901 --> 00:06:46.810
to get more criminal large,
wide.

116
00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:49.530
He was providing all kinds of shit about the guineas and he spots.

117
00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:53.600
That was a great movie too,
by the way.

118
00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:58.010
Nice to train a guy who was one of the whities hitman.
Dana.
Why?
No,
no,
no,
no.

119
00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:01.850
To the Teanaway stay like a threatened,
he had to move out of town.
It was a ball.

120
00:07:01.851 --> 00:07:06.320
Joe Baltar related.
Yes.
It was both elated.
When I was teaching taekwondo,

121
00:07:06.321 --> 00:07:07.790
I had one of the guys that was in my class,

122
00:07:07.791 --> 00:07:11.330
it was whacking people for what he calls her and he was asking me,

123
00:07:11.331 --> 00:07:13.340
if you want to kill somebody with your bare hands,
where would you hit him?

124
00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:18.260
I was like,
oh,
the neck.
I was like 18.
I was like,
oh.
He goes,
correct.
Ya look good.

125
00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:23.000
Yeah.
I like that.
What was it,
Kevin?
Uh,
no,
no,
no.
But you know,
Kevin,
you know,

126
00:07:23.001 --> 00:07:27.920
he went away to this,
um,
now the tough kid.
Yeah.
All related.
All of them together,

127
00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:32.180
you know.
Um,
this guy was a different guy.
This guy was,
he went away too.

128
00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:35.450
But I mean,
he went away forever.
He was one of those guys,

129
00:07:35.451 --> 00:07:38.540
like they caught them blood under his fingernails and he was working with white.

130
00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:42.180
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well,
there's a lot of guys that were,
I mean,
it was a big organization.

131
00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:46.550
And when,
when we were kids,
I mean,
everybody knew it was a big org.
I mean,

132
00:07:46.551 --> 00:07:49.430
it wasn't,
it wasn't a fucking secret.
Oh No.
Oh,
I know.

133
00:07:49.431 --> 00:07:52.040
How did Hannity's attempt to link Mower to Whitey Bulger?

134
00:07:52.041 --> 00:07:55.980
Hold up this article in the Boston Globe says that's not true.
Whatever.

135
00:07:56.030 --> 00:08:00.170
It's the FBI and he wasn't,
there wasn't there,
wasn't there then.
Oh,

136
00:08:00.171 --> 00:08:01.850
he wasn't at the FBI.
Yeah.

137
00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:05.990
It says lower serve the US attorney's office in Boston from 82 to 88,

138
00:08:05.991 --> 00:08:07.250
his chief of the criminal division,

139
00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:10.280
first assistant us attorney and acting us attorney from weathered a year.

140
00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:10.911
During that time,

141
00:08:10.911 --> 00:08:14.420
Bolger ran a sprawling criminal enterprise and got away with murders because he

142
00:08:14.421 --> 00:08:18.740
was a longtime FBI informant who corrupted his handlers.
The FBI.

143
00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:20.660
He corrupted his handlers.
I love it.

144
00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:24.200
And the FBI and the New England organized crime strike force,

145
00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:28.940
a prosecutor prosecutorial unit that worked independently in the US Attorney's

146
00:08:28.941 --> 00:08:32.690
office,
uh,
reportedly,
uh,
reported directly to the Justice Department.

147
00:08:32.691 --> 00:08:36.500
Use Bulgur to build cases against the mafia and give him a pass on its own

148
00:08:36.501 --> 00:08:38.150
crimes.
The FBI is corrupt.

149
00:08:38.151 --> 00:08:41.630
Relationship with Bulger was exposed after he was indicted on federal

150
00:08:41.631 --> 00:08:44.810
racketeering charges in 1995 became a fugitive.

151
00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:49.790
He was captured 16 years later,
I would hear,
you know,
so,
uh,
yeah,

152
00:08:49.791 --> 00:08:53.780
it was captured in Santa Monica.
And,
uh,
so when did,
Mueller says,

153
00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:56.520
did mujer know the men have been wrongly convicted

154
00:08:56.970 --> 00:09:00.060
<v 2>and look the other way?
There's nothing linking Mujer to that case.</v>

155
00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:02.310
According to several attorneys for,

156
00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:06.870
for the men volume as court records and a former federal judge who presided over

157
00:09:06.871 --> 00:09:11.871
their wrongful imprisonment trial in 2007 the US District Judge Nancy Gertner

158
00:09:13.291 --> 00:09:16.980
found the FBI deliberately withheld evidence at the foremen were innocent.

159
00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:20.720
The bureau help cover up the injustice for deck cheese cries.

160
00:09:20.721 --> 00:09:22.380
I fucking hate read and shit like that.

161
00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:27.600
She ordered the government to pay the men and their families 101.7 million.

162
00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:30.360
Okay,
maybe worth it.
How

163
00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:33.390
<v 3>long did you guys go away for?
Let's be honest,</v>

164
00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:35.810
you're never going to make a hundred millions chicken scratch too.

165
00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:39.780
They all got 100 million.
If every one of them got 100 million,
I mean I'm,
I'm in.

166
00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:41.730
I mean how much time you have to do?

167
00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:46.140
How many times do you get fucked where you're in jail?
How's it per load?

168
00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:51.600
Fuck man.
So maybe it was just a rumor that he was a part of that.
Well,

169
00:09:51.601 --> 00:09:54.060
like you said though,
let's they FBI,
she has a story,
broke them,

170
00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:56.790
showed they call the paper and said,
listen,
get your facts straight.
Well,

171
00:09:56.791 --> 00:09:57.481
how crazy is it?

172
00:09:57.481 --> 00:10:01.620
The FBI covered up the information and knew those guys were innocent.

173
00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:04.230
That is dark.
Who went to jail for that?

174
00:10:04.231 --> 00:10:07.230
Did the guys who covered it up go to jail?
I'm not sure,

175
00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:14.130
but uh,
two of them died.
You can't,
they died in jail.
Two of them died in jail.

176
00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:15.153
Oh.

177
00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:20.430
You know they caught him because his wife was yelling and shit all the time.

178
00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:24.620
Yeah,
she was cocoa.
He had fucking cash on the walls and shit.
Did He,

179
00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:27.330
I used to sell dope,
meet door to door when I,

180
00:10:27.331 --> 00:10:29.850
before I started comedy and I used to go to fucking went the hell,

181
00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:33.330
not one where I was.
And I would,
I would want the,
why people would look at my,

182
00:10:33.331 --> 00:10:36.570
I take out my shit and the that's slapped that break sound like 40 bucks a pop,

183
00:10:36.571 --> 00:10:39.630
get the fuck out.
And then somebody explained to me,

184
00:10:39.631 --> 00:10:43.260
you know what the hell is like,
why he bolts?
Wow.

185
00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:48.060
So you were selling meat and his neighbor fucking same in East Boston.

186
00:10:48.061 --> 00:10:48.871
I knocked at the door,

187
00:10:48.871 --> 00:10:52.110
a couple of guys and revere that we'll get like fucking connected.

188
00:10:52.111 --> 00:10:54.480
My Buddy Al know who they were and shit later on.

189
00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:56.350
Well they probably knew people from meatpacking.

190
00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:59.400
They've probably gotten it off the boats of course.
And I'm like,

191
00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:02.040
I'm doing my little spiel there for a boy.
Look,
you know,

192
00:11:02.290 --> 00:11:05.730
a fucking boiler room operation.
Now you break it down per meal,
it comes out,

193
00:11:05.731 --> 00:11:08.370
they're three bucks a meeting.
And they had done the math in the head.

194
00:11:08.371 --> 00:11:12.290
You could tell they were like bookies,
you know,
they like 40 bucks a pump,

195
00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:16.350
get the fuck up.
My steps wasn't really that much.
Well it was ridiculous,

196
00:11:16.351 --> 00:11:20.910
you know.
But uh,
and I was in Rhode Island,
uh,
banging doors and,
and,

197
00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:24.330
and uh,
I got the same response and I looked down and I see in the streets,

198
00:11:24.331 --> 00:11:26.100
the lines of the streets are red,
white,
and green.

199
00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:29.230
I was in federal hill and providence with a mafia style.

200
00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:32.660
Look at that sign article.
Look at this Whitey Bulger.

201
00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:35.640
Santa Monica hideout was full of money.
It's still brims with mystery.

202
00:11:35.641 --> 00:11:38.820
He was living in like a normal apartment.
I know.
So weird.

203
00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:44.160
He had $822,000 in cash and valuables.
Wow.

204
00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:48.540
Jesus Christ.
I liked that movie.
I thought Johnny Depp was great now.
Yeah,
he was.

205
00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:52.890
He was great in it.
Yeah.
That's a creepy dude.
Yeah.
He was as creepy as they get.

206
00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:56.210
It's amazing how much corruption was involved in that case.
Yes.

207
00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:59.770
And the federal government was a part of it and they let that monster,

208
00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:05.410
they let them thrive.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So makes you wonder about the FBI today.

209
00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:08.830
Well,
it should make you want,
it shows you what they're capable of it.
That way.

210
00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:10.090
Whenever you're doing that,

211
00:12:10.091 --> 00:12:14.230
whenever you're allowing someone to commit murder and deal drugs to get other

212
00:12:14.231 --> 00:12:16.960
people that are committing murder and dealing drugs,
like what?

213
00:12:17.510 --> 00:12:18.380
Because they would just want it.

214
00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:22.630
They just look what happens with cops in this is very unfortunate,

215
00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:27.010
but this is just is just what happens when you have a a game and the game is

216
00:12:27.011 --> 00:12:29.420
arrest people.
The game is when,
right.

217
00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:32.230
You have a certain amount of calls you have to make and if you could make more

218
00:12:32.231 --> 00:12:34.570
callers because you're in bed with a bad guy,

219
00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:36.940
especially if maybe you grew up in that neighborhood,

220
00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:39.270
it's always been kind of an accepted part of that neighborhood.

221
00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:42.430
That Guy Conley grew up with one.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
exactly.

222
00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:47.260
It makes a sneaky little deal.
Yeah,
it was Sam,
it lawyers.

223
00:12:47.261 --> 00:12:49.360
It's all about you have to have,
it's like sports.

224
00:12:49.361 --> 00:12:51.820
You have to have a winning record.
You're not going to succeed.

225
00:12:51.821 --> 00:12:55.150
So they play outside the rules.

226
00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:57.850
I mean that's one of the reasons why cops and people have such a weird

227
00:12:57.851 --> 00:13:00.860
relationship because they're always looking to arrest people and [inaudible]

228
00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:05.450
cops talking to him like,
ah,
I don't put me on your record,
I'm on.
And they just,

229
00:13:05.770 --> 00:13:08.500
Oh,
maybe I can get you for something.
I got to get somebody.

230
00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:12.820
And I know when they have quotas,
like when you have quote,
like what would,

231
00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:17.590
what would the police force do if nobody broke crimes anymore?
Did make shit up.

232
00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:20.990
If they,
what would they do?
Like legitimately,
if they really do,

233
00:13:20.991 --> 00:13:23.080
that would never happen.
It would never happen.

234
00:13:23.081 --> 00:13:26.840
But what if everybody got on mushrooms and the world,

235
00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:31.390
the world got cleaned up.
I was wondering how long it would take to get there.

236
00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:34.480
Not much.
How much time can we get a couple of years ago?

237
00:13:34.510 --> 00:13:37.000
I mean in the compensation to mushrooms.
I got some right here.

238
00:13:37.001 --> 00:13:40.540
If you want some dude,
I can't even handle regular mushrooms.
Fucking chance.

239
00:13:40.541 --> 00:13:44.200
Shataki make me crazy.
I don't know how you'd do that shit.

240
00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:49.150
We discussion DMT and Portabello Nice glaze.

241
00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:54.100
Demi glaze on it.
Yeah,
it just,
it though the hole.
I mean the,

242
00:13:54.101 --> 00:13:56.650
the music thing is very,
it's very interesting.

243
00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:01.300
It's very interesting because you're watching a professional like cast a web

244
00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:02.860
like nice and slow.

245
00:14:03.550 --> 00:14:07.880
Nice and slow with the full force of the FBI against you.
And if the,

246
00:14:07.890 --> 00:14:11.890
they would against a rod,
just don't,
like I said,
they'll do,
you know it's creepy.

247
00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:12.041
Well,

248
00:14:12.041 --> 00:14:15.220
Jamie said they opened up the government today to distract from the fact that

249
00:14:15.221 --> 00:14:17.980
Roger Stone got arrested.
Most likely.
I think you're right.

250
00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:22.600
I think that's a good assessment,
I guess.
Eh,

251
00:14:22.750 --> 00:14:27.430
I mean top trumps the final target.
So,
um,
but yeah,
he's gonna,

252
00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:31.450
he's gonna threaten stone with,
you know,
he's like 66.
Yeah.

253
00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:33.700
Threatens them with 10 years.
He's probably gonna.
Yeah.

254
00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:37.990
He's kind of just enough to fucking make,
I'm sang,
but he's such a sing song.

255
00:14:40.690 --> 00:14:44.470
Like Dershowitz says they don't just sang.
They,
they uh,
they actually,
uh,

256
00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:45.940
how did Dershowitz put it?
They actually,

257
00:14:45.941 --> 00:14:49.650
and I'll come up with the lyrics they create.
They don't just sing.
Yeah.
You know,

258
00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:53.000
what do you think is going to happen to Trump if you had a yes.

259
00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:59.130
As far as this investigation?
Nothing really pass other coffee over here.

260
00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:03.620
Thank you.
Yeah.
Thanks brother.
Why do you think nothing's going to happen?

261
00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:05.720
Is that,
well that's not true.

262
00:15:05.721 --> 00:15:09.080
I shouldn't say that because only because I think Molly's pretty fucking evil

263
00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:13.340
and it will come up with something.
Well,
you know what?

264
00:15:13.341 --> 00:15:17.120
Impeachment at the,
at the worst,
but where's the high crimes and misdemeanors?

265
00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:21.560
What?
Well,
if there's obstruction of justice,
if there was collusion,

266
00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:23.210
if there was any sort of,

267
00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:28.610
if they can prove that there was some sort of concerted effort to undermine

268
00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:31.900
democracy.
Yeah.
Which I don't think I,

269
00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:35.330
I don't think they'll get to get that.
Even with Roger Stone,

270
00:15:35.510 --> 00:15:40.010
they're not charging him with collision.
A conspiracy just lying and covering up.

271
00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:43.040
They don't,
they don't have them for collusion.
Oh,
conspiracy.

272
00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:47.030
They're lying and covering up the,
uh,
interactions with Russians.
Right.

273
00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:50.360
So what it is,
I guess that would be lists angle.
Yeah.
No,

274
00:15:50.390 --> 00:15:53.540
Jamie was talking about something yesterday and I started listening to this

275
00:15:53.541 --> 00:15:58.541
recent Sam Harris' podcast and it is fucking fascinating how much Russian troll

276
00:16:00.471 --> 00:16:04.460
farms and all these fake accounts and what they're trying to do.

277
00:16:04.610 --> 00:16:07.760
And one of the things they're trying to do is what Jamie was saying was that

278
00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:11.330
that kid with the mag a hat with a native American beat the drum in front of

279
00:16:11.331 --> 00:16:11.930
them.

280
00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:16.310
The image of that was posted by this website that turned out to be a Russian

281
00:16:16.311 --> 00:16:21.270
troll farm,
but it was in Brazil.
Was it Jane as a blogger in Brazil?
Yeah.

282
00:16:21.810 --> 00:16:23.300
When they'd,
CNN looked into it,

283
00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:25.580
they just kind of asked Twitter what's going on with this account.

284
00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:29.030
And by the time they'd asked them,
they just suspended that council.
It's gone.

285
00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:32.750
But,
but you said they suspended account because the account was a fake account.

286
00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:34.010
They had a,

287
00:16:34.130 --> 00:16:38.830
they thought it was posing as like a California teacher and as Telia,

288
00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:43.310
but it was,
it was an actual blogger and Brazil.
Oh,

289
00:16:43.311 --> 00:16:45.170
so it was Brazil wasn't rushing.
No,

290
00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:50.470
I wasn't sure it was sewn into a fake account if someone's,

291
00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:52.770
but yes,
they saw some seeds of,
yeah,

292
00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:54.830
well they're trying to get people against each other.

293
00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:56.330
They're doing that in a minute.

294
00:16:56.331 --> 00:16:59.600
Like people need to understand that this is actually really happening and we

295
00:16:59.601 --> 00:17:02.420
need their help.
Hurley,
what we do and against each other day,

296
00:17:02.421 --> 00:17:04.970
we need the Russians help.
Well,
if you stop and think about it,

297
00:17:04.971 --> 00:17:07.000
has there ever been a time with the left and the right were more,

298
00:17:07.001 --> 00:17:09.220
it chose throats and ends enough?
You don't need rush

299
00:17:11.050 --> 00:17:12.020
was Arabic,

300
00:17:12.790 --> 00:17:16.190
but are CNN enough to really get people turned against each other like this?

301
00:17:16.191 --> 00:17:20.510
No fucking way.
You need angry discourse online.
And the way that comes from,

302
00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:21.573
there's [inaudible],

303
00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:26.450
there's an amazing Radiolab podcast about this where they talked to people that

304
00:17:26.451 --> 00:17:30.200
actually worked in these troll farms and that these people were,

305
00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:33.620
they would both be left wing and right wing and is one of the things that

306
00:17:33.621 --> 00:17:36.830
they're talking about on the Sam Harris' podcast.
It's,

307
00:17:36.831 --> 00:17:38.780
I think it's called a war of information,

308
00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:45.250
but they'll pose as like a pro choice people and say ridiculous shifts like over

309
00:17:46.791 --> 00:17:47.810
the top.
Ridiculous.

310
00:17:47.930 --> 00:17:52.440
And then they'll pose is life American flag.
And you know,

311
00:17:52.450 --> 00:17:56.670
Magda in the,
in the,
you know,
the Hashtag and there they're heading,

312
00:17:56.790 --> 00:17:57.960
but they have nothing to do with that.

313
00:17:57.960 --> 00:18:01.290
They're just Russians and they're just trying to get people riled up.

314
00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:05.760
And you see people jump on board.
Oh,
Shyman in.
But,
um,

315
00:18:05.850 --> 00:18:09.900
I was talking to a comic that we were talking about that I won't bring his name

316
00:18:09.901 --> 00:18:13.560
up,
but he referred me to this,
this Russian guy.

317
00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:16.110
I can't add a mock of Bremmer's name,

318
00:18:16.111 --> 00:18:20.340
but this is a clip of this Russian guy who worked for the KGB defected over
here.

319
00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:25.080
And he was explaining how Russia does that.
Yeah,
and this was back in the 80s Oh,

320
00:18:25.081 --> 00:18:28.920
well,
we do it too.
Everybody does it.
They all do it.
Everybody does it.

321
00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:32.010
They fuck with the system in any way,

322
00:18:32.011 --> 00:18:34.890
shape or form in order to achieve a desired result.

323
00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:37.530
I think the Russians are the best at it,
apparently.
Well,

324
00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:40.220
I just think they're way more dedicated to it and then,
yeah,

325
00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:43.380
I mean it's a sneaky way to go about doing things too because Russia doesn't

326
00:18:43.381 --> 00:18:47.820
have the,
the kind of money that the United States,

327
00:18:47.950 --> 00:18:51.810
so they got nothing they had out there.
Their economies the size of Texas.
Yeah.

328
00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:54.340
All's I have is nuclear weapons there.

329
00:18:54.810 --> 00:18:58.220
Almost like a third world and a brutal dictator.
A dictator.
Yeah.

330
00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:01.590
That's all it takes.
But as a far as the economy and everything,

331
00:19:01.591 --> 00:19:03.780
they're like a third world she had.
Yeah.
It's,
well,

332
00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:07.060
they're like a small European country,
but it's really interesting when you,

333
00:19:07.090 --> 00:19:10.680
you listen to these podcasts about how much effort they put into sewing

334
00:19:10.681 --> 00:19:14.130
discourse or discord to getting people upset with each other,

335
00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:18.270
to starting arguments and to saying things that are going to upset people in

336
00:19:18.271 --> 00:19:21.690
order to get the right versus the left.
Yeah.
To like,
sure.

337
00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:25.260
To undermine democracy from the inside.
Yeah.
It's really interesting.

338
00:19:26.610 --> 00:19:30.060
I mean it's,
it's weird that it works,
but it makes sense that it works.

339
00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:34.630
It's a sneaky ass strategy.
Yeah.

340
00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:40.530
You think CNN does just as good a job.
They really do harm,
but you're so,

341
00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:44.870
you're so right wing.
You can't.
I'm not so right when Zhao right wing.
All right.

342
00:19:44.910 --> 00:19:49.320
Middle,
middle,
right.
I'd say center right of center.
Right.
Of Center,
right.

343
00:19:49.321 --> 00:19:52.750
Of Center.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
What's wrong with CNN?

344
00:19:53.850 --> 00:19:56.140
Do you like it?
First of all,
I don't need to hear it.

345
00:19:56.141 --> 00:19:59.220
And every fucking airport or if I'm doing a Gig last fucking words,

346
00:19:59.221 --> 00:20:02.520
I want to hear her wolf blitzer before my plane crashes.
Um,

347
00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:06.480
somebody told me Wolf Blitzer got on jeopardy and they exposed them.
Yes,

348
00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:10.530
I remember reading that because you know,
people get on television,

349
00:20:10.531 --> 00:20:13.560
they read off a teleprompter.
You think they're brilliant,
they seem brilliant,

350
00:20:13.890 --> 00:20:16.110
and then you get them alone.

351
00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:20.070
About Louis goes on a jeopardy and winds.

352
00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:24.210
What Lucy did he remember they have celebrities on once in a while.

353
00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:26.040
When did you do that?
A couple of years ago.

354
00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:29.070
Did he go on with regular people in when I forget who he's against.

355
00:20:29.071 --> 00:20:33.770
I think it was other famous paper.
That makes sense.
Jonathan dropped.
Well,

356
00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:34.561
he's a very smart,

357
00:20:34.561 --> 00:20:39.120
well do you remember he went on jeopardy against regular people time.
Yeah.

358
00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:43.140
He won the whole tournament.
A comic.
So folks don't take us light less.

359
00:20:43.141 --> 00:20:47.930
He still right for there.
He has wolf blitzer minus 4,000 dumb ass.

360
00:20:50.370 --> 00:20:54.880
Yeah.
It didn't work out so well.
Ah,
fuck.
Good Fun.
It is hilarious.

361
00:20:55.290 --> 00:20:58.030
Well,
you know,
people can pretend to be smart.
You know,

362
00:20:58.090 --> 00:21:01.810
you read all these Shell prompter,
they give you the script,
you know.

363
00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:06.520
But John was Jonathan Groff.
Does he still write for Conan?
It's a good question.

364
00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:10.510
Don't know.
The last time I saw him.
Uh,
but he was fucking really,

365
00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:14.330
really bright.
Funny Guy Too.
And really funny.
Yeah.

366
00:21:14.530 --> 00:21:16.630
I don't think he does stand up anymore though.
Lead just rights.

367
00:21:16.690 --> 00:21:17.710
That's how smart he is.

368
00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:22.210
He's like enough of this nonsense is jokey joke.

369
00:21:22.211 --> 00:21:27.130
Non said enough is enough.
I'm starting to feel that way.
Um,
but why,

370
00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:32.010
why do you hate CNN?
I'll come on all the fucking shit they put out there.
And uh,

371
00:21:32.650 --> 00:21:34.930
just an example,
how about before the one went,

372
00:21:34.931 --> 00:21:39.250
Donna Brazil had the notes for Hillary before the fucking Barney.
Yes.

373
00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:43.470
Remember that this credit you CNN was,
she was a pond it right.

374
00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:44.890
And they still had a run.

375
00:21:45.010 --> 00:21:47.200
That's what's coming to us that they had her on after that.

376
00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:52.180
He told Dale questions we're going to be,
yeah.
Well her book was amazing though,

377
00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:55.190
that that's what's interesting is they fucked her over and then she came in

378
00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:59.110
notebook and then rip them.
Ooh,
is there,
I have it.
I haven't read it yet.

379
00:22:00.110 --> 00:22:04.870
Put the,
what I read about how they rigged the DNC.
This is how they,
how they,
uh,

380
00:22:04.930 --> 00:22:09.430
Fuck Bernie out of the primaries.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Woo.

381
00:22:10.030 --> 00:22:13.840
Yeah.
Bernie gets screwed.
It's a dark business.
Fucking,

382
00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:17.090
it's all the same.
They're all in coach.

383
00:22:17.230 --> 00:22:21.490
But you don't think like the mainstream media is a little like a propaganda arm

384
00:22:21.491 --> 00:22:25.900
for the Democratic Party.
Well,
they did 93% negative coverage.

385
00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:28.270
They definitely think they're working for the good,

386
00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:32.890
but it's only 3% negative coverage with Trump.
Trump is an,
you know,

387
00:22:32.891 --> 00:22:37.390
he's an unusually polarizing figure.
Sure.
I mean,
was it that way with,
um,

388
00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:40.120
well I guess it was probably pretty negative with Bush all.

389
00:22:40.121 --> 00:22:43.090
It was a different world back then.
No,
it was,
but they always,

390
00:22:43.091 --> 00:22:44.110
since I've been a kid,

391
00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:48.760
I mean Reagan was a dummy and just to fucking be actor and an idiot,
no racist.

392
00:22:49.030 --> 00:22:52.840
You can look at the ship year after year.
That's true.
George Bush,

393
00:22:52.841 --> 00:22:57.430
senior George W.
Bush,
Dick Cheney warmonger but it's the same shit.

394
00:22:57.431 --> 00:22:59.610
Racist,
bigot race and it works.
And Ford,

395
00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:02.440
Ford was a moron and Ford was my,

396
00:23:02.450 --> 00:23:04.900
about how he's portrayed on SNL and he was always falling down.

397
00:23:04.901 --> 00:23:07.910
I couldn't walk three feet,
which was kind of true,
actually.
Got It.

398
00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:10.930
And he was an athlete when it,
but it's always been that way.

399
00:23:10.931 --> 00:23:15.380
So the mainstream media has always sort of a more liberal,
and I'll write,

400
00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:18.430
but then you have Fox News,
which goes far the other way.

401
00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:21.580
What would their opinion shows?
But at least when you watch Fox News,

402
00:23:21.581 --> 00:23:25.080
which everybody who hates Fox,
who's never watches it,
number one,
uh,
but,

403
00:23:25.090 --> 00:23:29.120
but they at least have liberals on and Shepard Smith,
yes and hates.

404
00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:32.740
Yes he does.
He looks like every guy that bullied them as a kid.

405
00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:36.130
Do you think that's why I ate something?
I do.
That's it.
That's the only reason.

406
00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:39.840
The only way to nothing.
And that's the reason most of them hate him.
He said,

407
00:23:40.110 --> 00:23:42.100
here's what's not,
here's what they don't bring up.

408
00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:43.870
Even Hannity and all these guys,

409
00:23:43.871 --> 00:23:47.990
you get your head going like a passion wants change a second that he's getting

410
00:23:47.991 --> 00:23:50.690
irritated with me already.
I got to get you out of La.

411
00:23:50.691 --> 00:23:55.080
I'm afraid you're going to get disease.
Uh,
and everything's good over nine.
Now.

412
00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:59.450
Tell me about it.
Uh,
but uh,
what,
what were you just talking about?

413
00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:02.630
Why they hate Trump?
Because they never bring up this though.

414
00:24:02.631 --> 00:24:05.990
They never cause he's a alpha male,
blonde haired,

415
00:24:05.991 --> 00:24:09.320
blue eyed fucking billionaire.
That is the,

416
00:24:09.620 --> 00:24:11.960
that's the embodiment of the devil for the left.

417
00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:14.870
They never bring that up on the shelf.
That's really what it is,

418
00:24:14.871 --> 00:24:17.990
is nothing to do with him lying all the time.
And that's nothing to do with it.

419
00:24:17.991 --> 00:24:22.400
What's he lie about the number of people at his inauguration as opposed to Obama

420
00:24:22.401 --> 00:24:24.920
going,
oh,
you can keep your healthcare.
I mean the fucking,
you know,

421
00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:29.900
he doesn't lie any more than any other president.
You don't think so?
If he does,

422
00:24:29.901 --> 00:24:33.650
it's trivial shit.
He's a salesman.
He's a,
there's a fine line,

423
00:24:33.710 --> 00:24:37.970
but it's definitely a salesman.
But Oh,
he's a bullshit.
But that's what we need.

424
00:24:37.971 --> 00:24:42.320
We're a cooperation where corporate the countries don't think so.

425
00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:47.130
That's what I always heard.
It's kind of like that little bit.
I mean,

426
00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:51.390
it's some,
some sort of an organization.
He really is.
Hillary Clinton Lion.

427
00:24:51.650 --> 00:24:53.930
Oh yeah,
for sure.
Well,
why don't you get called on it?

428
00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:58.640
How's that fat Twat not in cups.
Oh,
how dare you.
It is.
Good question.

429
00:24:58.730 --> 00:25:00.590
You know?
Yeah,
it's a great question.

430
00:25:00.770 --> 00:25:03.870
I was talking to Mike Baker who used to work for the CIA.
Oh,
I'd buy it.

431
00:25:03.890 --> 00:25:05.690
Met My fucking web guy.
No,
because he,

432
00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:10.940
he wanted to come out here with me and Mike Baker from the CIO is if he,

433
00:25:11.330 --> 00:25:15.530
if he did anything remotely like what Hillary did,
he'd be in jail for 30 years.

434
00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:16.700
Yeah,
of course.
Yeah.

435
00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:18.740
I remember the kid in the submarine that worked for the Navy,

436
00:25:18.741 --> 00:25:20.150
but he took pictures of the submarine.

437
00:25:20.570 --> 00:25:24.260
I mean he like took a selfie and it had bad shit in the background that it

438
00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:27.740
wasn't supposed to take photos off.
And how long was he in jail?
I don't know.

439
00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:33.280
So I would just like to see some equity as far as people being held accountable

440
00:25:33.621 --> 00:25:34.454
on both sides.

441
00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:37.430
That's how maybe it would have been different if Hillary made it through.

442
00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:40.700
Maybe it would have been different in terms of like media coverage.

443
00:25:40.790 --> 00:25:43.550
If she actually became president out,
they would have sucked her ass.

444
00:25:43.690 --> 00:25:47.990
You're there as song.
Yeah,
I think so.
I don't know man.

445
00:25:48.010 --> 00:25:52.430
Once Donna Brazile's book came out and people have an understanding about the

446
00:25:52.431 --> 00:25:53.750
inner workings of the Party,

447
00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:58.790
I mean I think look it politics or it's dirty,
dirty business.

448
00:25:58.820 --> 00:26:03.270
Phillip Day stirred,
he's worse than podcast,
but podcasts are pretty clean tie.

449
00:26:03.271 --> 00:26:08.150
No,
like relatively,
but it's very quick.

450
00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:12.170
That's why people come to it.
Yeah.
You can't get the truth from mainstream media.

451
00:26:12.350 --> 00:26:16.180
While I was trying to explain to a friend who was talking about doing a podcast,

452
00:26:16.190 --> 00:26:19.910
a deal with a network and I was like,
stop.

453
00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:24.230
You can't this the one thing that you can have where you can,

454
00:26:24.231 --> 00:26:27.890
it can be mainstream and it's free of everything.
Free of any influence.

455
00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:31.430
And you're going to let a bunch of pen,
pencil pushers and button pressers.

456
00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:35.600
They're gonna tell you what you can and can't say which direction you can and

457
00:26:35.601 --> 00:26:38.420
can't go.
You know they're going to try to influence you.

458
00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:42.740
But isn't Google doing that now?
What do you mean with conservatives?

459
00:26:42.770 --> 00:26:44.310
Like shutting down Dennis Prager

460
00:26:44.370 --> 00:26:48.930
<v 2>as like a fucking,
what do you mean good fire as well?</v>

461
00:26:48.990 --> 00:26:53.280
Youtube is owned by go about a company.
Okay.
What I'm talking about a company,

462
00:26:53.550 --> 00:26:56.870
you going into business with them and you can wear your a podcast,

463
00:26:56.890 --> 00:26:57.900
you're free and independent.

464
00:26:58.030 --> 00:27:02.340
It's probably the only thing in the world where you can be completely free and

465
00:27:02.341 --> 00:27:04.050
independent and still reach millions of people.

466
00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:07.010
It really is the only thing in the world.
But how,
what is Google doing?

467
00:27:07.011 --> 00:27:11.190
What I'm saying?
Google owns youtube,
right,
right.
And uh,

468
00:27:11.250 --> 00:27:16.080
people like Dennis Prager religious right guy is his shall get shut down on

469
00:27:16.081 --> 00:27:19.320
Youtube.
What do you mean it's shut down?
They shut it.
That he's suing.

470
00:27:19.321 --> 00:27:22.230
He's showing fucking gold bill.
I didn't know about this.
Yeah,
I know.

471
00:27:22.231 --> 00:27:27.090
He does those shows with a Corolla Corolla to listen to him.
And I lived in La.

472
00:27:27.091 --> 00:27:30.390
He's a conservative religious Jewish guy.
I've listened to him a hundred.
Yes.

473
00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:32.700
Well they considered hate speech.
I mean that's,

474
00:27:32.701 --> 00:27:36.240
that's when we're getting into a dangerous territory.
Wait a minute,
I pull up,
uh,

475
00:27:36.270 --> 00:27:39.270
what,
what happened to him?
Cause I'm,
I'm completely ignorant about this.

476
00:27:39.310 --> 00:27:40.610
This is the first time I'm hearing about,
oh,

477
00:27:40.611 --> 00:27:44.480
this is going to go to the supreme court.
Really thanks to,
so they pulled it.

478
00:27:44.490 --> 00:27:48.510
So they took his page down.
They said,
you can't have a page on youtube anymore.

479
00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:52.050
Yeah.
They say,
shut the show down.
Do you remember what it was about?

480
00:27:52.260 --> 00:27:55.080
Not specifically,
but I know it was labeled hate.

481
00:27:55.290 --> 00:27:58.320
And if you listen to this guy for 10 minutes,
he's the most congenial,

482
00:27:58.590 --> 00:28:03.270
fair minded,
uh,
you know,
but he's,
he's a,
you know,

483
00:28:03.330 --> 00:28:07.590
a religious guy.
Do you know flying,
do you know Doug was Martinez?

484
00:28:08.610 --> 00:28:12.250
He's actually her who is,
he's a,
he's a a,

485
00:28:12.270 --> 00:28:15.410
an intellectual from England who wrote about,
uh,

486
00:28:15.810 --> 00:28:20.580
wrote a book about immigrants in Europe called the strange death,

487
00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:24.520
I think it's called Islam and the strange death of Europe.
And uh,

488
00:28:24.780 --> 00:28:29.370
he's basically talking about how people from these countries that have emigrated

489
00:28:29.371 --> 00:28:32.310
into Europe are changing the culture,
changing the culture.

490
00:28:32.311 --> 00:28:35.430
And there's all sorts of,
you know,

491
00:28:35.850 --> 00:28:40.850
crimes and things that are happening that didn't exist before and people are

492
00:28:40.921 --> 00:28:44.520
developing these communities of likeminded people that didn't exist prior.

493
00:28:44.730 --> 00:28:47.660
No go zones.
And,
and he's saying that this is,
you know,

494
00:28:47.670 --> 00:28:49.050
this is fundamentally dangerous,

495
00:28:49.470 --> 00:28:54.470
but he's saying it from a point of perspective of understanding the actual facts

496
00:28:54.811 --> 00:28:58.950
involve and talking about the situation and talking about how these are people

497
00:28:58.951 --> 00:29:00.570
that don't respect homosexuals.

498
00:29:00.571 --> 00:29:03.690
They want to throw them off roofs and they have these pages.

499
00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:08.460
They have these opinions about people that are extremely antiquated and not

500
00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:12.060
aligned with European values in the modern Western world.
Right?
The,

501
00:29:12.410 --> 00:29:16.710
he and Sam Harris had a conversation and that conversation got flagged on

502
00:29:16.711 --> 00:29:21.390
Youtube.
Uh,
it got flack as someone put it up in there.
You know,

503
00:29:21.391 --> 00:29:24.870
you make it like a little watch list.
What is it called?
What was it called?

504
00:29:24.871 --> 00:29:28.560
The v the list.
You could,
will you put it on Youtube,

505
00:29:28.561 --> 00:29:31.380
on your channel where you could the playlist.

506
00:29:31.710 --> 00:29:34.400
So he puts it on his playlist and he gets a compute,
uh,

507
00:29:34.650 --> 00:29:39.420
a community guideline strike against him for putting up this conversation

508
00:29:39.421 --> 00:29:42.130
between two intellectuals.
So I,
this conversation with this lady

509
00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:45.900
<v 0>at Youtube,
and I said,
well,
why,
why would you do that?
Why,
why does that get?</v>

510
00:29:45.901 --> 00:29:47.380
She goes,
well,
it's hate speech.
I go,

511
00:29:47.381 --> 00:29:51.460
it's hate speech of you talking about to intellectuals having a discussion about

512
00:29:51.461 --> 00:29:54.340
a real thing that's happening right now in Europe.
And you're saying hate speech.

513
00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:57.620
If you listen to the podcast,
there's no slurs used.
Just facts.

514
00:29:57.621 --> 00:30:01.450
So just talking about Prego,
but this is,
this was the way she said it,

515
00:30:01.451 --> 00:30:04.990
cause it's hate speech.
I'm like,
you had,
you said that so easily.
Yes.

516
00:30:04.991 --> 00:30:06.910
You'd never seen a lot of power,

517
00:30:07.270 --> 00:30:11.920
but it's also a lot of irresponsible power for the responsible use of power.
But,

518
00:30:11.950 --> 00:30:15.850
but,
but,
but my point is they're cracking down on people who lean,
right?

519
00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:19.010
Whether it's Twitter.
Yes.
It's 100% true.
Yeah.

520
00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:23.650
And that's a big fucking problem.
A hate speech.

521
00:30:24.250 --> 00:30:25.790
We're going to let Google decide,
uh,

522
00:30:26.350 --> 00:30:29.100
what's the name of the company that owns alphabet?
Uh,

523
00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:32.590
they're going to decide what,
what I,
I brought that up on.

524
00:30:32.650 --> 00:30:37.650
I brought that up on a tough crowd years ago about when you disagree with the

525
00:30:39.251 --> 00:30:42.280
liberal or whatever you're arguing with,
they always go,
you're a hater.

526
00:30:42.730 --> 00:30:46.390
They would keep saying that.
And that's what it turned into.

527
00:30:46.391 --> 00:30:50.980
If you dismiss a grade,
you're a hater now it's you're a bigot or a racist.

528
00:30:50.981 --> 00:30:55.000
If you didn't agree with Obama's policies,
your bigot or a racist.
And,

529
00:30:55.001 --> 00:30:58.060
and that shit works that that's been working for the left the years.

530
00:30:58.180 --> 00:30:59.710
But now that the social media,

531
00:30:59.711 --> 00:31:04.080
Google controls almost all the information you are,
you and I hear every day.

532
00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:07.750
I mean,
that's why it's so dangerous.
So look up.
Yeah.

533
00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:10.840
Prager's a as the purse example that comes to mind,

534
00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:15.970
that guy he owes me.
Um,
uh,

535
00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:21.410
yeah,
because he's,
he's,
you know,
a Christian or whatever.
We should,
he's not he

536
00:31:21.830 --> 00:31:24.800
<v 3>Jewish but,
but you don't get up at it unless,
unless I'm,</v>

537
00:31:24.801 --> 00:31:27.710
what I just read was wrong.
They weren't deleted from Youtube.

538
00:31:27.711 --> 00:31:29.990
At least they weren't deleted.
They were restricted.

539
00:31:30.290 --> 00:31:34.940
Put it like meaning like show up at,
uh,
the adult thing.

540
00:31:34.941 --> 00:31:37.490
Like you have to have an account that says you're 18 or older or something like

541
00:31:37.491 --> 00:31:40.970
that.
And they were fighting and having a lawsuit against that,

542
00:31:40.971 --> 00:31:44.390
saying that what they have in their videos or not shouldn't be behind that,

543
00:31:44.930 --> 00:31:48.950
like that wall,
whatever that is.
They also then,
but this is my point,

544
00:31:48.951 --> 00:31:52.340
you have to go to youtube to get the store,
hold on.
So I'm on their website.

545
00:31:52.341 --> 00:31:54.460
I went to a couple different websites to see it,
but they were also,

546
00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:57.950
like yesterday they had ads blacklisted from Spotify.

547
00:31:58.550 --> 00:32:02.390
So they had ads that were I guess initially approved and now they have been

548
00:32:02.930 --> 00:32:06.890
disapproved and they haven't really explained to them as well.
He's so and soap.

549
00:32:06.891 --> 00:32:10.400
So,
but his page is still up,
you know Corolla,
don't you?
Yeah,

550
00:32:10.580 --> 00:32:14.890
I believe that's come about it.
But the youtube page is still up.

551
00:32:14.900 --> 00:32:18.170
It shows not his show was shut down.
They might have,

552
00:32:18.260 --> 00:32:20.030
they might have taken it down by now.
This is like,

553
00:32:20.150 --> 00:32:23.330
this is kind of from a couple of months ago.
They shot him down.

554
00:32:24.230 --> 00:32:27.620
So if you go to the Dennis Prager youtube channel,
it doesn't exist.

555
00:32:29.450 --> 00:32:33.230
So the idea that they would make that 18 plus because it's conservative.

556
00:32:33.260 --> 00:32:37.250
That's hilarious.
It's up.
This is it.

557
00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:40.230
This is this channel Bro.
Prager u,
yeah,
let's try it.

558
00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:42.620
But it's got a million subscribers.

559
00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:47.570
Million 949 I they brought it back up.
Is that what you're saying?
Maybe

560
00:32:49.850 --> 00:32:53.990
they have a video up from an hour ago.
Spotify,
bands,
Prager from advertising.

561
00:32:54.650 --> 00:32:58.570
Google a lawsuit.
I mean that's what it was about.
It's about them getting angry,

562
00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:02.400
restrict him angry.
Cause we're not getting the full story here.
Well I mean,

563
00:33:02.670 --> 00:33:07.670
not that it's up right now.
It's,
he's uh,
he's still on him.
Yeah,

564
00:33:07.730 --> 00:33:12.290
no,
I believe you.
So my point being is these big tech,

565
00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:17.090
big tech companies,
uh,
crushing conservative,
well here,
most part.

566
00:33:17.630 --> 00:33:19.550
Yes.
And here's a good way to look at it.

567
00:33:19.580 --> 00:33:22.040
If you're going after a guy like Dennis Prager,
who,
again,

568
00:33:22.041 --> 00:33:25.160
it's the most congenial guy,
never swears,
very,

569
00:33:25.161 --> 00:33:27.260
very mild mannered,

570
00:33:27.261 --> 00:33:31.610
very cool and calm and whether you agree with them or disagree with them,
right.

571
00:33:31.910 --> 00:33:36.710
It's not the way to go about something like this if you disagree with someone is

572
00:33:36.711 --> 00:33:40.970
not to shut them down.
I was to have a debate.
Exactly.
Yeah.

573
00:33:41.060 --> 00:33:44.330
And that's not happening.
Well,
you know,
well,
you saw the Google memo.

574
00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:47.810
You saw what happened with that guy when he provided all this information about

575
00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:51.890
one of the reasons why women don't get into tech and they labeled him as Dang a

576
00:33:51.891 --> 00:33:54.980
massage says a woman hater and define like,
no,

577
00:33:54.981 --> 00:33:58.040
he's giving you scientific studies that show that women have different
interests.

578
00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:00.050
Is that Lawrence Summers?
You're talking about this Ben?

579
00:34:00.051 --> 00:34:04.160
A few since Lawrence Summers was actually the president of Harvard and he was

580
00:34:04.161 --> 00:34:08.120
giving a speech and,
and that's all he said he was.

581
00:34:08.150 --> 00:34:11.330
He brought up the numbers as far as males going into science and math.

582
00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:16.100
He didn't say women not good at it and he get fucking canned from Auburn.
Yeah.

583
00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:19.910
Yeah.
You can't have anything that's fascism.
Yeah.

584
00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:23.180
If it disagrees with the orthodoxy,
they'll come down on you.

585
00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:27.920
Even if it's factual like James Damore and you could clearly back it up.

586
00:34:28.070 --> 00:34:30.710
You could look at the actual numbers.
Not only that,

587
00:34:30.711 --> 00:34:34.460
that James to more guy put a page and a half in there on strategies for

588
00:34:34.461 --> 00:34:39.200
encouraging women to get into tech.
I mean if he was a real massage demar Google.

589
00:34:39.230 --> 00:34:42.540
Google,
yes.
He's the Google memo going,
right?
That was what started it off.
These,

590
00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:44.630
all these intellectuals came to his side.
They'll look,

591
00:34:44.780 --> 00:34:46.640
why are we doing all this research?

592
00:34:46.790 --> 00:34:49.490
If you guys completely ignore it every time it comes up,
right?

593
00:34:49.820 --> 00:34:52.640
Like you're pretending that this research is not valid.
This research is,

594
00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:57.560
it's it's scientific information that shows that certain types of people are

595
00:34:57.561 --> 00:35:00.560
more interested in different things.
We've known that forever.

596
00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:05.920
That's why boy toys and girl toys are different because boys and girls like

597
00:35:06.171 --> 00:35:07.190
different shit.
I mean,

598
00:35:07.191 --> 00:35:11.540
it's basically a more complex version of that and he's essentially saying women

599
00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:15.920
like different things.
It doesn't show that.
It can't do both to say.

600
00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:20.210
The only difference between the sexes is Sochi constructed obstacles.

601
00:35:20.650 --> 00:35:24.050
We'll genders gender itself.

602
00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:29.180
It is.
They should come here and take a look at your place.
That would shut them.

603
00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:31.940
Shut the argument.
That's all male,
male,
gender.

604
00:35:31.941 --> 00:35:35.210
I've got some female stuff here from when my kids come over to attempt to tell.

605
00:35:35.390 --> 00:35:38.280
Tell them what you said to me when I say a fucking great place.
Oh,

606
00:35:38.281 --> 00:35:40.560
this is what happens when women don't get to tell you what to do

607
00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:47.310
place.
You have a warehouse of mail,
but this looks,

608
00:35:47.370 --> 00:35:50.170
that's not a nice guy.
That's not bad.
And three courses.

609
00:35:50.340 --> 00:35:54.660
But the problem was in this society,
male energy,
male thinking male,

610
00:35:54.661 --> 00:35:56.370
and he is vilified and you're,

611
00:35:56.371 --> 00:35:59.520
you're taught to think there's something wrong with being masculine.

612
00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:04.440
Being masculine is the reason why we don't speak German.
Okay,
stop.
Exactly.

613
00:36:04.470 --> 00:36:08.040
Talk about toxic masculinity.
Yo could you will be the poster boy for that Shit.

614
00:36:08.250 --> 00:36:08.610
Well,

615
00:36:08.610 --> 00:36:13.610
the whole reason why you need male people is because there's mail people,

616
00:36:13.951 --> 00:36:18.270
other places that will take away your shit and kill your people.
Exactly.

617
00:36:18.420 --> 00:36:21.240
This is not a bad thing.
Male does not equal evil.

618
00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:25.380
Just because there are evil men,
they are evil men.
Doesn't mean all men are evil.

619
00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:28.650
There's evil women too.
It doesn't mean all women are evil dated three of them.

620
00:36:29.330 --> 00:36:32.460
I bet you did it more than three,
let's be honest.
Yeah,
no,

621
00:36:32.461 --> 00:36:36.010
you're absolutely right.
But this toxic masculinity,
that is his fuss.

622
00:36:36.011 --> 00:36:40.970
Solera like you said,
rarely worldwide two.
However,
that turned out well.

623
00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:44.940
There's just so many dumb phrases like that,
you know,
we'll donate up.

624
00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:46.620
Do you know about heteronormative?

625
00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:52.700
I'm sure he knows CIS gendered.
CIS gendered.
Yes.

626
00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:56.280
Hetero normative.
Yeah.
Like you're,
you're imposing the norms.

627
00:36:56.520 --> 00:37:00.390
Like as if heterosexuality is normal.
Well,
did you see,

628
00:37:00.420 --> 00:37:03.600
what was the story a couple days ago and I was in California here.

629
00:37:03.601 --> 00:37:06.330
A beautiful state of California.
They're trying to the heat.

630
00:37:06.331 --> 00:37:11.130
You can't say he or she is they now lat?
Yeah.
Where everywhere.

631
00:37:11.190 --> 00:37:16.050
Uh,
I'm saying that,
I'm saying to Hannah something Jackson.
He,
uh,
yeah.

632
00:37:16.380 --> 00:37:20.070
Now you have to say they nope.
And they were passing it.
They had her in the,

633
00:37:20.250 --> 00:37:23.430
the meeting,
uh,
the actual,
uh,
town hall.
A city.

634
00:37:23.431 --> 00:37:27.330
Where are they passing the ordinance and at the end she goes,
my,
my grandma,

635
00:37:27.390 --> 00:37:29.790
my grammar teacher wouldn't approve of that.
She's rolling around her,

636
00:37:29.791 --> 00:37:31.260
but we won't hear from her.

637
00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:36.500
She said her and somebody called her out on it as she was passing the left wing.

638
00:37:36.790 --> 00:37:41.310
Nonsense.
You shouldn't buy your grandmother.
She's not here.

639
00:37:42.210 --> 00:37:45.300
It was corrected identification.
Of course.
She looked like Newt Gingrich.

640
00:37:45.310 --> 00:37:47.910
There she is,
California state senator bans.

641
00:37:47.911 --> 00:37:50.310
The use of he and she during committee hearings.

642
00:37:50.370 --> 00:37:53.750
Oh look at her with her perfect fucking liberal haircut.

643
00:37:54.330 --> 00:37:58.980
No Gingrich's haircut,
pow.
It's facing.
Some people are just hilarious,

644
00:37:59.910 --> 00:38:02.800
but they called her out.
She's trying to do a good thing though is you know,

645
00:38:03.180 --> 00:38:07.950
and uh,
that Colorado,
they had a laugh about it,
but uh,
that is so funny.

646
00:38:08.220 --> 00:38:13.080
What the fuck does she look like?
Oh my God.
We wouldn't be hearing from her.

647
00:38:13.110 --> 00:38:13.291
Well,

648
00:38:13.291 --> 00:38:17.250
you made me dress was an interrupted by listeners who corrected her usage and

649
00:38:17.251 --> 00:38:18.960
demand.
Oh,
stop,
stop,
go back.

650
00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:25.260
Corrected her usage and demand that she used the word they or them,

651
00:38:25.380 --> 00:38:29.640
they demanded.
See this is the problem with all this shit.
It's demanding.

652
00:38:29.641 --> 00:38:30.880
They're trying to control people.

653
00:38:30.881 --> 00:38:33.810
They're telling people what to do and what not to do.
And it's about power.

654
00:38:34.020 --> 00:38:38.380
A lot of this stuff is power as they're imposing their worldview on,
on you.

655
00:38:38.410 --> 00:38:41.560
But it's not even their worldview.
It's not real.
What it is,

656
00:38:41.561 --> 00:38:45.010
is they're just deciding that this is a thing that they're going to agree to and

657
00:38:45.011 --> 00:38:47.710
they're going to force other people to comply.
It's half the game.

658
00:38:48.090 --> 00:38:51.070
Half the game is just getting people to comply.
Well,
you do that by,

659
00:38:51.190 --> 00:38:54.550
and you start with language,
you control people's behavior through language,

660
00:38:54.551 --> 00:38:56.530
which is the definition of political.
Yes.

661
00:38:56.560 --> 00:39:00.310
Well that's what Carlin always said that fascism is just political correctness

662
00:39:00.311 --> 00:39:04.450
with good manners are political correctness is fascism with good manners.
Yeah.

663
00:39:04.630 --> 00:39:08.890
How about,
you saw the clip of Louie at governors when he was talking about this,

664
00:39:09.220 --> 00:39:13.690
how the,
you know,
the millennials or whoever demanding what we call them.

665
00:39:13.870 --> 00:39:18.160
Yes.
They are them I,
and he goes,
okay,
I'm,
Louis Goes,
okay,
I'm a location.

666
00:39:18.670 --> 00:39:22.570
It's your mother's con
man.
He goes,

667
00:39:22.571 --> 00:39:25.120
I got to come up with something more clever.
Not as harsh one.
Yeah,

668
00:39:25.330 --> 00:39:29.050
I'm a location.
Your mother's of,
yeah.

669
00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:34.300
What did you think about all that stuff getting leaked?
Well,
but Louise,

670
00:39:34.301 --> 00:39:37.990
you know Stan,
Stan hope at a really good point about that.
But what does he say,

671
00:39:38.290 --> 00:39:39.460
Doug?
He was saying like,
look,

672
00:39:39.461 --> 00:39:42.520
if this was a movie and if you took that movie and filmed it in the movie

673
00:39:42.521 --> 00:39:45.590
theater and then put it online,
you'd be a,
you'd go to jail.
That's right.

674
00:39:45.650 --> 00:39:49.840
You're a criminal,
you're stealing,
you're exposing your,
you're ruining his work.

675
00:39:49.870 --> 00:39:53.860
Yes,
but they think they can ruin his work cause he jerked off in front of some

676
00:39:53.861 --> 00:39:55.750
people.
I don't even know if it's that,

677
00:39:55.751 --> 00:39:58.480
I don't even know if the person that leaked it like was a Louis hater.

678
00:39:58.481 --> 00:40:00.560
Sometimes he makes a fan.
They were laughing hard.

679
00:40:01.350 --> 00:40:05.680
They had to phone in their table.
I was at,
it wasn't governors,

680
00:40:05.681 --> 00:40:09.040
it was the brokerage,
which is the same owners few years ago.

681
00:40:09.041 --> 00:40:11.530
And I'm up there doing my shit and working on a new hour.

682
00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:16.690
I looked on and the kid about 56th row,
I see him,
I see the red light.

683
00:40:16.930 --> 00:40:19.360
Yeah.
And he's got his head down.
So I come down off the stage,

684
00:40:19.361 --> 00:40:23.800
he doesn't even hear me and I grabbed the phone out of his hand.
Ah,

685
00:40:23.950 --> 00:40:27.100
I go dude you came out cause you're a fan of mine.
Right.
I go the problem,

686
00:40:27.110 --> 00:40:28.570
I explained it to him and the whole crowd.

687
00:40:28.690 --> 00:40:32.090
The problem with this is if you put this shit online,
I'm working on new,

688
00:40:32.150 --> 00:40:35.470
that's old material.
Right.
You're burning my shit.
You get it.
Yeah.

689
00:40:35.471 --> 00:40:37.600
It's all the other fans that listened to it for sure.

690
00:40:37.601 --> 00:40:41.500
And also it's not fair because these bits are never done.

691
00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:43.930
Like if you want to release it half baked,

692
00:40:44.290 --> 00:40:47.650
like when when you first start working on a bit,
you have a premise,

693
00:40:47.651 --> 00:40:50.470
you got kind of an idea where it's going hoarse.
Yeah.

694
00:40:50.471 --> 00:40:53.970
And then it eventually becomes a bit that you would put on a special,
right?
Yeah.

695
00:40:54.220 --> 00:40:58.930
And they'd get it halfway or a quarter and it'll look shitty and it's all if

696
00:40:58.931 --> 00:41:02.140
it's done,
if you're doing a bit that's complete.
Yeah.
They,

697
00:41:02.141 --> 00:41:05.320
it becomes old without some of the things that people were saying about Louie

698
00:41:05.321 --> 00:41:07.860
that the material's sloppy.
It's not like his old stuff.
He,
yeah,

699
00:41:07.870 --> 00:41:11.170
he's working shit.
I feel old stuff.
You saw when it was done,

700
00:41:11.620 --> 00:41:15.250
like if you came to the store and saw him working on a set like a few years
back,

701
00:41:15.251 --> 00:41:16.750
you would see the same kind of stuff.

702
00:41:16.780 --> 00:41:19.690
I got a couple of comments like that when I put my last special out there.
Like,

703
00:41:19.691 --> 00:41:21.260
well he's doing the same stuff.
Well,

704
00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:25.270
you came out to see me eight 10 months ago when I was working on it.
Yeah,
it's,

705
00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:28.480
it's,
it's something in process.
They don't understand though.

706
00:41:28.481 --> 00:41:32.380
Cause it seems like when you're onstage and you're camping up to toppy of and

707
00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:35.060
head and it seems like you're doing something that they can do.

708
00:41:35.090 --> 00:41:38.240
You're just talking,
oh,
I know.
You just talk and I could talk.

709
00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:41.030
It's like there's no other art form like that where it's just talking.

710
00:41:41.060 --> 00:41:45.070
That's exactly right.
Nobody yells at a concert,
nobody sh oh that fucking,

711
00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:48.860
you know,
I could play bass better than that jerk off,
but it stand up

712
00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:53.630
so people have,
you know,

713
00:41:53.631 --> 00:41:56.030
because people have made their friends laugh.

714
00:41:56.450 --> 00:41:59.240
I think Seinfeld solid in a book years ago because you know,

715
00:41:59.241 --> 00:42:00.200
you make your friends laugh,

716
00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:03.200
everybody's made their friends laugh with a comic and I,
and you're like,

717
00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:04.010
I can do,

718
00:42:04.010 --> 00:42:06.920
I call people out when they look bored with me or they have their arms folded.

719
00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:10.680
I go do it.
You've got that smug look on your face.
I know you could do this too,

720
00:42:10.681 --> 00:42:13.590
but you'd rather work at the fucking mattress factory 80 hours a week,

721
00:42:13.910 --> 00:42:18.080
making fucking $400 this is people that they're working at the mattress factory

722
00:42:18.081 --> 00:42:22.040
right now.
Listening to this going,
man.
Fuck you Nigga.
Fuck them.
Whoa.
Hey,

723
00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:26.150
how about you just ignore the guy that's $2,000 for a mattress.
You can weird.

724
00:42:26.300 --> 00:42:29.780
Well,
I know I'll make a mattress.
How much can I pay you to make a mattress?

725
00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:34.340
I don't know.
What am I getting it?
[inaudible] Alice tonight and San Diego Pike.

726
00:42:34.370 --> 00:42:36.500
I have to pay you a lot of money to build me a mattress.

727
00:42:40.250 --> 00:42:44.420
But you said it.
Go find the phase you have to pay for the phone.

728
00:42:44.450 --> 00:42:46.910
That would be it should all together get the fuck outta here.

729
00:42:46.911 --> 00:42:50.240
You can get a mattress.
Be Easy.
Lasers.
I get farm laying all over the house.

730
00:42:52.520 --> 00:42:56.480
Start with my wife's boobs.
Oh,
come on Joe.

731
00:42:57.440 --> 00:42:59.560
When he get this coffee,
it's fucking delicious.
Good.
Where?

732
00:42:59.561 --> 00:43:03.260
I think this is black rifle,
black rifle off that name.
It's a racist.
Oh,

733
00:43:03.261 --> 00:43:07.220
it's not so gun metal.
It's a company of veterans.

734
00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:12.890
It makes the coffee.
Yeah.
Veteran owned black.
Right.

735
00:43:12.891 --> 00:43:16.940
But fuck yeah,
Matt flags veteran on to confessional own company.
I got a flag.

736
00:43:16.941 --> 00:43:17.870
They sent me a,

737
00:43:18.110 --> 00:43:21.650
when I did the Afghanistan USL thank guy sent me a flag that they used in
battle.

738
00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:26.780
Nice.
You have it folded up and I had it hanging but then I made a gym out of my

739
00:43:26.900 --> 00:43:31.100
fucking whatever.
So I don't know where it is.
Oh,
we should probably find it.

740
00:43:31.130 --> 00:43:33.830
I should probably put it back up.
Shouldn't I?
So I brought that up.

741
00:43:34.310 --> 00:43:38.450
Don't worry about it.
Um,
the Louis C K set,
you know,

742
00:43:38.850 --> 00:43:40.910
was very similar in my opinion,

743
00:43:41.180 --> 00:43:43.160
to all the shit that he did before he got in trouble.

744
00:43:43.580 --> 00:43:46.820
But that's solely very similar.
Same kind of material.

745
00:43:46.850 --> 00:43:48.800
The same way he does things.
I mean,

746
00:43:48.860 --> 00:43:52.190
people forget that this is a guy who went on Saturday night live and did a joke

747
00:43:52.220 --> 00:43:55.390
about pedophilia,
pedophiles and about,
you know,
maybe we should like,

748
00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:58.450
let them get away with it so they don't kill your kids.
I mean there's,

749
00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:01.340
it's fucked up.
It's a fucked up bit.

750
00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:04.710
But he was the darling of the left back then and so,

751
00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:08.750
and is allowed to get away with that.
Yes.
If he tried to do that same material,

752
00:44:08.751 --> 00:44:10.820
if he hadn't done that then and instead did that,

753
00:44:10.821 --> 00:44:14.450
now people would be fucking horrified.
What is it Joe,

754
00:44:14.451 --> 00:44:19.370
about offending women or today's feminist?

755
00:44:19.371 --> 00:44:21.530
What they are at the,
in my opinion,

756
00:44:22.370 --> 00:44:25.220
all this political correctness that we hate so much shutting down.

757
00:44:25.250 --> 00:44:29.920
They are at the core,
but,
well,
p did the,
I say this,
the,

758
00:44:29.921 --> 00:44:31.750
the Zeitgeists of the times,
it's like a

759
00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:36.690
<v 2>fat chicks emotion.
Wow.
Very sensitive.
Uh,
you can't,</v>

760
00:44:37.020 --> 00:44:38.100
you can't cross them.

761
00:44:38.410 --> 00:44:41.580
But it's also because people are realizing now that they can make an impact.

762
00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:45.240
Like one of the things that I read because he's doing this thing in Pittsburgh,

763
00:44:45.270 --> 00:44:49.200
he was doing the Improv and Pittsburgh and this lady who wrote the article wrote

764
00:44:49.201 --> 00:44:52.770
that he's making people put their cell phones in bags.
Much like comedians,

765
00:44:52.771 --> 00:44:56.180
Dave Chappelle and Joe Rogan do.
She used my name to you did that.

766
00:44:56.250 --> 00:44:59.040
I've done it before,
but I only did it when I was filling my Netflix special.

767
00:44:59.130 --> 00:45:02.130
So I didn't want people putting the material out or right before I was releasing

768
00:45:02.131 --> 00:45:05.370
the special and then afterwards I decided it was too much of a pain in the ass.

769
00:45:05.700 --> 00:45:10.700
But the only reason why I was doing it w w had nothing to do with that.

770
00:45:10.930 --> 00:45:15.180
She said because they know words can offend and they don't want the
consequences.

771
00:45:15.330 --> 00:45:18.750
Well I'm going to put it on Netflix,
it's going to be out to the public.

772
00:45:18.751 --> 00:45:21.720
It's offensive.
It's going to,
if you're looking to get offended,

773
00:45:21.721 --> 00:45:23.940
go watch Netflix special.
There's plenty in there for you.

774
00:45:24.540 --> 00:45:28.280
But I need to be able to do it correctly.
Like I'm,
I'm,

775
00:45:28.320 --> 00:45:33.120
I want to work it out so that it has the maximum amount of laughs with the

776
00:45:33.121 --> 00:45:37.740
minimum amount of,
of people getting it the wrong way.
Right.
So this,

777
00:45:37.741 --> 00:45:40.850
it's all about wording and sitting upright and listening to it and go,

778
00:45:41.010 --> 00:45:44.460
maybe there's a better way and you can't do that if somebody releases your shit.

779
00:45:44.461 --> 00:45:48.120
And so these people that don't know comedy and they're saying this like you have

780
00:45:48.121 --> 00:45:52.050
no idea what the process is like,
you just don't.
And if you,
if you do,

781
00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:53.600
you would respect it and appreciate it.
Right,

782
00:45:53.850 --> 00:45:57.150
and the people that are comics that don't respect and appreciate the process,

783
00:45:57.540 --> 00:45:59.250
like that's where we are now,

784
00:45:59.820 --> 00:46:02.770
but it's just because people can make an impact.

785
00:46:02.770 --> 00:46:05.310
They can have a reaction just like the people yelling at her,

786
00:46:05.430 --> 00:46:07.590
you know that she said,
she said,

787
00:46:07.620 --> 00:46:11.820
oh my grandmother would be rolling over in her grave,
say day in them.

788
00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:15.060
Say they're using them,
they're just trying to get a reaction from you.

789
00:46:15.061 --> 00:46:16.290
They're just trying to push buttons.

790
00:46:16.410 --> 00:46:20.310
They're just knowing that they can say something and they can have some sort of

791
00:46:20.311 --> 00:46:23.970
an impact.
We're going to get Louis C K band from here.
You know,

792
00:46:24.060 --> 00:46:26.640
we're going to get nick depalo kicked out of this club.

793
00:46:26.670 --> 00:46:27.750
You can't come to this club.

794
00:46:27.751 --> 00:46:30.690
You've talked negatively about women and women's empowerment and that's

795
00:46:30.691 --> 00:46:35.430
dangerous to girls.
I only get kicked out of one place.
Of course,

796
00:46:35.431 --> 00:46:36.780
one of the best clubs in the country.

797
00:46:36.810 --> 00:46:39.990
What club then comedy work you got kicked out of the comedy works.

798
00:46:40.030 --> 00:46:42.730
I saw like 20 something years ago for what will,
it was a batch,

799
00:46:42.731 --> 00:46:47.731
right party ruining the middle guys set the Mc set and then I went up my second

800
00:46:50.101 --> 00:46:52.310
time there.
I think that's a great club obviously.

801
00:46:52.830 --> 00:46:56.640
And they started yelling shit out.
Like take off,
get Shag deck.
That guy.

802
00:46:56.641 --> 00:46:58.500
And I said,
can we throw these fat cats out?

803
00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:03.480
And it turns out a fat client was running a club so I was picked out of it.

804
00:47:04.900 --> 00:47:09.630
Hey,
well that's how I feel Joe.
Well I was thrown out because of my words.

805
00:47:09.900 --> 00:47:13.520
Well and I get kicked off the smell on onstage and rooster feathers.

806
00:47:14.300 --> 00:47:17.650
Those are the only two places.
Yeah,
I think that was a long time ago though,

807
00:47:17.651 --> 00:47:21.540
right?
I'm smoking on stage.
Oh it was the last time you smoked on stage?
Oh,

808
00:47:22.020 --> 00:47:26.220
a couple weeks ago.
How the fat black pussy cat.
Do you smoke still?

809
00:47:27.480 --> 00:47:30.550
Well you say still,
I just really,
I was,
I

810
00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:34.360
<v 3>1520 years ago I was a social smoker because everyone need the comedy cellar.</v>

811
00:47:34.390 --> 00:47:37.660
We gotta be sitting across from Mattel breathing in his shit and I'm like,

812
00:47:37.661 --> 00:47:41.920
I might as well put a filter on my mouth and uh,
so you know,
I'd have one at two,

813
00:47:42.730 --> 00:47:46.580
but then I really pick up the pace about a year ago.
What the fuck is that?

814
00:47:46.590 --> 00:47:50.920
Keeps the pounds.
Huh?
What Joe?
It's not dangerous than steroids.

815
00:47:51.190 --> 00:47:55.990
It's not,
I don't know.
I just know I like it but uh,

816
00:47:56.440 --> 00:48:00.270
but uh,
always do.
Oh I do.
Yeah.

817
00:48:00.280 --> 00:48:04.240
What kind of you smoke Marlboro Lights.
Really?
Yeah.
Oh,
was gentle it.
The lights.

818
00:48:04.330 --> 00:48:07.800
Well I'll take cancer light.
You Get a light tumor?
Yeah.
You get to,

819
00:48:08.560 --> 00:48:13.030
how many are you smoking a day?
Half a pack.
Really Do,

820
00:48:13.031 --> 00:48:15.820
you're too smart for that.
That's outrageous.
Oh Joe,
please.

821
00:48:15.970 --> 00:48:19.210
You are can't kill me at camp now.
Wow.

822
00:48:19.240 --> 00:48:24.100
My grandfather smoked pall malls unfiltered and Campbell's,
yeah,

823
00:48:24.101 --> 00:48:25.350
you can't kill it to Paula.

824
00:48:31.410 --> 00:48:35.290
I do 56.
Yeah,
I do it.
My Act though,
cause my friends go,

825
00:48:35.291 --> 00:48:36.880
why don't we just start at this age?
And I go,
why?

826
00:48:37.060 --> 00:48:40.060
Why would you start your 20 so he could have have asked cancer in your forties

827
00:48:40.120 --> 00:48:44.950
I'm timing it out.
Mm.
I see.
If a doctor tells me I have cancer in 25 years,

828
00:48:44.951 --> 00:48:47.980
I'm going to kiss him on the lips.
You see the look.

829
00:48:47.981 --> 00:48:49.870
Some guys in their eighties they look happy.
They're like,

830
00:48:49.871 --> 00:48:54.550
I wish I smoked when I was a fucking kid.
I knew you would have disapproved.

831
00:48:55.100 --> 00:49:00.080
Sad for you is true.
I did that you call removed.
Yeah,
no,

832
00:49:00.081 --> 00:49:03.970
exactly.
I'd rather call this guy.
I get the,
I'm very vain.

833
00:49:03.971 --> 00:49:05.260
I don't want to be that lady.
It looks like

834
00:49:08.220 --> 00:49:10.570
I don't want to be that bridge.
She was so cute when she was young.
You receive?

835
00:49:10.720 --> 00:49:15.040
Yes,
and then she turned out the pop by wow.
Would the voice and everything,

836
00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:18.470
but I'll,
I'll kick it.
Yeah.

837
00:49:19.500 --> 00:49:22.960
You stopped juicing.
Not juicing.
I take testosterone replacement there.

838
00:49:22.990 --> 00:49:27.280
Why do my doctor don't need it?
That's how I,
you say I don't need it.

839
00:49:27.310 --> 00:49:30.790
That's why I don't need it because I do it if I don't do it.

840
00:49:30.960 --> 00:49:34.030
The day before you started doing your old man,
excuse me.

841
00:49:35.830 --> 00:49:39.220
Trust me if I can get you on it.
Go to a doctor,

842
00:49:39.221 --> 00:49:42.000
they get your hormone levels to do it tomorrow and I'll quit the cigarettes.

843
00:49:42.420 --> 00:49:45.640
Quit the cigarettes.
Promise.
Yeah,
I do need it.

844
00:49:45.641 --> 00:49:49.270
I mean I destroyed my shoulders playing football and then I have aches and pains

845
00:49:49.271 --> 00:49:54.210
and uh,
but uh,
you know,
I'm five,
uh,
five 90,

846
00:49:54.220 --> 00:49:58.990
three quarters to 13.
That's not too bad.
That's not bad.
Dude.

847
00:49:59.580 --> 00:50:04.120
You make the Italian thickness and I work out density bro.

848
00:50:05.260 --> 00:50:09.550
I got the shoulders density.
Um,
but this is the biggest I've ever seen.
You,

849
00:50:09.880 --> 00:50:10.780
I've been working out a lot.

850
00:50:10.840 --> 00:50:15.100
Plus it haven't been running cause I had some stem cells shot into my knee.
Oh,

851
00:50:15.101 --> 00:50:19.830
you barely.
Yeah,
I've had some uh,
uh,
a meniscus issues and um,
I,

852
00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:22.750
I'm a fucking idiot.
I can't let him sit.
I,

853
00:50:23.200 --> 00:50:25.480
I've got stem cells before and it felt good.

854
00:50:25.720 --> 00:50:30.540
And then I run miles in the hills every day.
A week later.
Yeah.

855
00:50:30.950 --> 00:50:35.840
Yeah,
yeah.
I have,
I have slight a arthritis in both knees.

856
00:50:35.920 --> 00:50:39.920
Yeah.
Well,
stem cells help.
That definitely does.
There's,

857
00:50:39.921 --> 00:50:42.980
there's a bunch of different things you could do to help that before it gets

858
00:50:42.981 --> 00:50:46.100
real bad.
But,
uh,
one of the things they're doing in Panama,

859
00:50:46.660 --> 00:50:51.230
and I sent my mom down there to a doctor Neil Riordan cause very good.
Yeah.

860
00:50:51.260 --> 00:50:54.500
Do you know he is?
No,
no,
no,
no.
He,
I had him on a show with,
uh,

861
00:50:55.430 --> 00:50:59.300
with Mel Gibson and Mel Gibson's dad was 92 when he went down there.

862
00:50:59.300 --> 00:51:01.800
He's in a wheelchair.
It was all fucked up.
Eight years in,

863
00:51:01.801 --> 00:51:06.530
he walks out a hundred years old.
He's fine.
He's a hundreds,
108 years old.

864
00:51:06.710 --> 00:51:08.720
That's what happens when you're 92 and live eight more years.

865
00:51:10.340 --> 00:51:13.110
Thanks for doing the math.
And that's what happened to him.
He yells,
shut out.

866
00:51:13.180 --> 00:51:17.120
You can,
you can say racist shit.
You get it off your chest.
He lived to a hundred.

867
00:51:17.121 --> 00:51:21.470
Well,
it's only the booze that makes them racist.
I know.
Fucking guy's my hero.

868
00:51:22.970 --> 00:51:27.280
Fucking love Mel Gibson.
He's as he ever made a bad movie.
Um,
I mean,

869
00:51:27.320 --> 00:51:31.310
made it himself.
Maybe coming a few shit,
shit,
movies,

870
00:51:31.730 --> 00:51:36.290
toxic masculinity right there.
I liked Apocalypto.
I thought that was great.

871
00:51:36.291 --> 00:51:38.900
A lot of people shit on that and it was right up your alley.
Yeah,
I loved it.

872
00:51:38.930 --> 00:51:43.420
Yeah,
exactly.
I'm,
I'm fascinated with that.
I wish,

873
00:51:43.440 --> 00:51:46.940
I wish I was apart.
No,
I loved that movie.
I,
I,
you know,

874
00:51:47.450 --> 00:51:50.510
I think he's a,
he's a very intense,

875
00:51:51.080 --> 00:51:55.850
very unusual eccentric guy.
Like just being around him,
you,
you,

876
00:51:55.851 --> 00:51:58.600
you get this sense of his energy.
It's like what's the hall of the place?

877
00:51:58.601 --> 00:52:02.570
All right.
Like rigged them out.
Yeah.
From lethal.
I don't have that.

878
00:52:02.630 --> 00:52:04.880
Like a lot of that I think probably came like that,

879
00:52:04.881 --> 00:52:09.140
that character probably came from like the dark inner workings of Mel Gibson's

880
00:52:09.141 --> 00:52:13.070
mind you had really is,
you would like yell like that too though.
I,

881
00:52:13.550 --> 00:52:17.810
I don't have that energy.
Metro Trump kept calling Jeb Bush low energy.

882
00:52:18.230 --> 00:52:21.220
I was laying on the couch going,
that's fucking me.
He's talking about it.

883
00:52:22.010 --> 00:52:25.010
I'm laying on the couch and I hear about somebody dying in an avalanche and I

884
00:52:25.011 --> 00:52:28.160
watch it on Tate and I laughed because I wouldn't have a fucking be dropped off

885
00:52:28.161 --> 00:52:30.840
in a helicopter at the top of a mountain to go snowboarding.
Yeah.

886
00:52:30.950 --> 00:52:34.010
And then they die and laugh my balls off eating a bag of chips.

887
00:52:34.040 --> 00:52:37.730
Well the one person,
he's never called anybody anything is Nancy Pelosi.

888
00:52:37.731 --> 00:52:41.840
And people like,
why hasn't he come up with a nickname for her yet?
Yeah.

889
00:52:42.260 --> 00:52:43.093
You know,

890
00:52:43.700 --> 00:52:46.890
cause you can't say content that's going to cost him the election that will cost

891
00:52:46.891 --> 00:52:50.390
them 20,
27 said a joke about that.
He's like,

892
00:52:50.391 --> 00:52:53.390
it's countdown until Trump tall,

893
00:52:55.420 --> 00:53:00.070
thick ankle talk face.
That's what I call Hillary.
I don't even call her.
Uh,
what,

894
00:53:00.220 --> 00:53:02.360
what kind of a nickname,
if you were going to help him,

895
00:53:02.390 --> 00:53:04.830
like if he hired you like Nick [inaudible],

896
00:53:04.970 --> 00:53:09.140
I need a solid republican comic to help me with my one liners.
What do you think?

897
00:53:09.360 --> 00:53:12.950
Well,
I called her on my show.
I refer her to the,
uh,
uh,

898
00:53:12.951 --> 00:53:16.610
the leathery nippled that's too wordy.

899
00:53:16.740 --> 00:53:21.320
We need some pretty good luck catching her day like a lion.
Ted.
Okay.

900
00:53:22.270 --> 00:53:26.010
Fuck and Naughty Nancy,
what did he call Hillary?
Crooked Hillary.

901
00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:29.920
<v 0>Crooked Hillary.
Lying Ted.
How Bout Energy Jeb?</v>

902
00:53:30.030 --> 00:53:34.500
How about a yeast infection in heels?

903
00:53:37.230 --> 00:53:39.000
How about lying liberal?

904
00:53:40.780 --> 00:53:41.613
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

905
00:53:42.160 --> 00:53:45.460
<v 0>Fuck stick.
Do you know that she's worth $100 million?
Yes,
I do.</v>

906
00:53:45.520 --> 00:53:47.440
But she figured out it's the little people jog.

907
00:53:48.880 --> 00:53:51.280
She represents the working class.
You know,

908
00:53:51.281 --> 00:53:53.860
she has fucking walls around our matching.
Meanwhile,

909
00:53:53.861 --> 00:53:58.270
people laying their own feces in San Francisco.
Well,
that Laura Loomer chick,

910
00:53:58.271 --> 00:54:00.190
the chick that,
uh,
handcuffed herself to Twitter,

911
00:54:00.191 --> 00:54:04.520
she hopped Nancy's fence and he started setting up,
uh,
like uh Oh,
I agree.

912
00:54:04.570 --> 00:54:08.110
Camp Nancy Slot.
Did you see that?
What happened?

913
00:54:08.800 --> 00:54:12.370
What was the result?
Illegal.
She's doing something illegal.
She's trespassing.

914
00:54:12.910 --> 00:54:16.900
I would say to Nancy,
I'll be outside of this fence is immoral.
MM,
right.

915
00:54:16.901 --> 00:54:20.200
Build that wall or don't,
I always think the wall still,

916
00:54:20.201 --> 00:54:24.250
but when we have the machine guns and tanks and flame throwers,
like I took them,

917
00:54:26.130 --> 00:54:29.360
you don't have to kill.
I'm serious about this.
You're going to laugh.
Okay.
Because

918
00:54:30.960 --> 00:54:32.570
you don't have to,
but seriously,

919
00:54:32.580 --> 00:54:37.260
I love how we rule out lethal force as far as protecting our board.

920
00:54:37.410 --> 00:54:40.650
That's not even on the plate.
So I,
okay.

921
00:54:40.651 --> 00:54:44.330
It's too many of us to pick somebody off as they're climbing event,
but okay.

922
00:54:44.630 --> 00:54:47.730
You something less lethal.
A supersoaker filled with cat piss

923
00:54:49.850 --> 00:54:54.020
with a woman and her baby trunk come over here.
If he asked,

924
00:54:54.050 --> 00:54:56.470
that's who's coming over.
It's not fucking mostly eats.

925
00:54:56.480 --> 00:55:00.030
I'm one of your all males and all the women in Sheldon would have just come off

926
00:55:00.031 --> 00:55:01.410
the wall.
What do you do with them?

927
00:55:01.770 --> 00:55:03.300
Send them back to where the fuck that came from.

928
00:55:04.770 --> 00:55:07.410
Give no a sympathy for those folks that are trying to come over here.

929
00:55:07.440 --> 00:55:11.880
The ones that uh,
were,
were immigrant.
Yes.
Children.
Absolutely.

930
00:55:11.980 --> 00:55:15.240
When did your parents come over?
My grandpa ramp up mine as well.

931
00:55:16.770 --> 00:55:20.430
At the turn of the century,
like 1902 1,903 yup.
Fun.

932
00:55:20.431 --> 00:55:24.040
They should have stayed in Italy.
You think people should have stayed in Paul?

933
00:55:24.090 --> 00:55:27.180
The Irish had a,
stayed in Ireland would have no new Kapalo it will be great.

934
00:55:27.780 --> 00:55:29.100
Experiment is not working.

935
00:55:29.430 --> 00:55:32.520
You gotta admit this is fuck is wrong with you and watch these viral videos.

936
00:55:34.310 --> 00:55:37.030
It's not,
I know you're joking around,
but I kind of seem,

937
00:55:37.031 --> 00:55:41.780
I seem a little bit more dour.
Oh,
previous our previous conversations we've had,

938
00:55:42.260 --> 00:55:47.190
I was faking it,
Joe.
I was faking a truck came along and I said,

939
00:55:47.330 --> 00:55:52.070
I can say this,
let's take it off my chest lightened.
Cheeriness remember my bid,

940
00:55:52.071 --> 00:55:54.830
I had a great bit about immigration,
how it was like having a big party,

941
00:55:54.831 --> 00:55:56.840
but you had to contribute to the party.
Remember the bid on,

942
00:55:56.841 --> 00:56:00.740
it's one of my albums.
The Irish brought the booze.
You Italians brought the food.

943
00:56:01.210 --> 00:56:06.110
Oh,
okay.
I do remember that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And the Mexican said,
fuck it.

944
00:56:06.111 --> 00:56:10.660
We'll clean up.
I have to itch.
And
people loved it.
You

945
00:56:12.440 --> 00:56:15.500
know,
I look,
I defend Latino's all the time on my show.

946
00:56:15.530 --> 00:56:18.930
They like Italians were at the turn of the century.
Yes.
Hard working.

947
00:56:19.040 --> 00:56:23.090
And when you watch the news and you see a lot of people dying,
you know,

948
00:56:23.110 --> 00:56:26.740
fighting for us,
a lot of Latino names in it.
I'm a big fan.

949
00:56:27.310 --> 00:56:29.470
That's not the problem.
You know,
so,

950
00:56:30.340 --> 00:56:33.690
but I don't think he should be labeled a bigot.
If you believe in,
you know,

951
00:56:33.700 --> 00:56:38.230
securing the borders and it's not immoral.
How about all the heroin coming over?

952
00:56:38.231 --> 00:56:40.130
Is that a lie too?
I mean,
you know,

953
00:56:40.140 --> 00:56:42.550
dying that over there and you pay attention to the Chapo trial.

954
00:56:43.240 --> 00:56:46.800
They're bringing a little cargo ships.
Most of it's coming over and car does it.

955
00:56:47.050 --> 00:56:50.690
And so if the soprano's they said an eight out of 10 cargo ships never get cha.

956
00:56:50.950 --> 00:56:54.010
Yes,
that's true.

957
00:56:54.011 --> 00:56:56.800
I was talking to a guy who was a longshoreman about that.
He's like,

958
00:56:56.801 --> 00:56:58.570
you don't know what the fuck's in those things.

959
00:56:59.440 --> 00:57:03.020
I know Annette creepy one of them was going to blow up.
That's the fuck she put.

960
00:57:03.021 --> 00:57:05.710
She don't give them any I,
they already have these ideas.

961
00:57:05.740 --> 00:57:09.160
They called me up and said,
that's not a bad idea.
How did you get punched?
Who,

962
00:57:09.220 --> 00:57:13.510
why did that Lady Punch you?
It was a 20 year old,
uh,
bipolar girl.

963
00:57:13.790 --> 00:57:18.010
Uh,
I was at levity live.
I did a show,

964
00:57:18.190 --> 00:57:19.300
came offstage,

965
00:57:19.740 --> 00:57:23.380
went into the green room for a few minutes and then came back out.

966
00:57:23.381 --> 00:57:27.080
And I was standing to the left of the stage and I,

967
00:57:27.081 --> 00:57:29.890
I don't always shake hands and do all that shit after the show.

968
00:57:30.400 --> 00:57:32.920
I just don't feel it's in the job description.
Sometimes I'll do it,

969
00:57:32.921 --> 00:57:33.754
sometimes they won't.

970
00:57:33.880 --> 00:57:36.790
But some people started coming up to being shaken hands and taking pictures.

971
00:57:37.180 --> 00:57:41.590
And this guy approaches me.
So it looked like you a little bit,
uh,

972
00:57:41.770 --> 00:57:46.000
stands to my right and he goes,
can I get a picture of they go,
sure.

973
00:57:46.001 --> 00:57:49.000
I stand in my right.
I'm looking at him talking to him.
He's like,
yeah,

974
00:57:49.001 --> 00:57:52.000
I enjoyed the show,
but my daughter wanted a punch you in the face.

975
00:57:52.150 --> 00:57:55.260
He didn't even finish the word face.
And I get suckered from this side.

976
00:57:55.261 --> 00:58:00.160
Didn't even know she was in the fucking room all sudden Bam.
Whoa.
And I mean,

977
00:58:00.161 --> 00:58:03.070
Bam.
I mean fucking,
you know,
I was,

978
00:58:03.940 --> 00:58:06.610
I don't know if you ever get fucking suckered,
uh,
I could feel the,

979
00:58:06.611 --> 00:58:09.820
I close and immediately,
you know,
and I looked right at him.

980
00:58:09.821 --> 00:58:12.700
This is how good my instincts were.
Even when I was in shock,
I go,

981
00:58:12.701 --> 00:58:15.550
did you just fucking set me up?
No,
it's nothing like that.
Matt.

982
00:58:15.940 --> 00:58:19.780
He didn't jump in and he didn't jump in and,
and go to his daughter.

983
00:58:19.781 --> 00:58:24.200
What are you doing?
And I was kinder.
I to this day,
believe it was complicit.
Uh,

984
00:58:24.310 --> 00:58:29.180
he was complicit in it,
but she still pursuing it.
What did she don't she,

985
00:58:29.290 --> 00:58:32.560
I finally looked at her.
I go,
why?
Why did you fucking it?
Why'd you do that?

986
00:58:32.620 --> 00:58:37.270
Because you're mean she thought I was racist and sexist.
Meanwhile,

987
00:58:37.271 --> 00:58:40.870
there was a table of black people,
Dominican.
It was a very diverse crowd.

988
00:58:41.140 --> 00:58:44.530
Absolutely loved it.
Coming to my defense after that happened,

989
00:58:44.830 --> 00:58:47.500
nobody got offended.
Even a friend of mine who see me my in time,

990
00:58:47.501 --> 00:58:51.190
cause you weren't even being that political that night that she had Birkenstocks

991
00:58:51.191 --> 00:58:55.720
on and you know,
bipolar and,
and,
and uh,
I'm still pursuing it.

992
00:58:55.870 --> 00:58:59.950
And the guy didn't apologize.
Nothing he was,
he didn't apologize,
but he,
I said,

993
00:58:59.951 --> 00:59:03.670
you just fucking said no,
I didn't man.
And it's,
it's nothing like that.
You know,

994
00:59:03.820 --> 00:59:07.390
I,
she said I shouldn't have brought here,
brought her here.
But you did,

995
00:59:07.391 --> 00:59:09.880
you'll weaponize your bipolar Datta is what you did.

996
00:59:10.060 --> 00:59:12.730
I believe they sat down at the table before they left the house.

997
00:59:13.120 --> 00:59:15.590
He knows what I did for comedy and he be,
he hated.

998
00:59:15.700 --> 00:59:19.990
He didn't have the balls to do it himself.
You think?
Yeah,
that's what I look at.

999
00:59:19.991 --> 00:59:21.980
You.
I'm going to work,
but

1000
00:59:21.990 --> 00:59:24.810
<v 3>those kettle bells,
before I leave here,
I'm going to find this motherfucker.</v>

1001
00:59:24.890 --> 00:59:27.290
Got To get you on a bike and get you to burn off some energy.

1002
00:59:28.010 --> 00:59:32.990
Jesus Christ as my rifle.
Coffee,
love dish extra and owned coffee.

1003
00:59:33.110 --> 00:59:36.230
It's very potent.
I want to contribute anything veteran's day.

1004
00:59:36.250 --> 00:59:38.900
I got some bags for you.
I'll get you some great stuff.
But yeah,

1005
00:59:38.901 --> 00:59:43.160
so the fucking Ike,
you had the funniest.
This is what's funny about it.
For years,

1006
00:59:43.161 --> 00:59:46.230
people tell me to,
you know,
keep your temper in check at Bubba by,
you know,

1007
00:59:46.250 --> 00:59:47.660
you'll fuck up career.
You don't Bubba,

1008
00:59:47.790 --> 00:59:50.480
I've been hearing that for years after this happened.
They're all gone.

1009
00:59:50.600 --> 00:59:53.930
Why didn't you hit her back?
Why do you,
I,
you,

1010
00:59:53.950 --> 00:59:57.470
you texted me like the next day or that night,
I can't remember.
And you said,
uh,

1011
00:59:57.780 --> 01:00:01.370
you,
it's made me laugh of five minutes.
You go,
Joe Goes,

1012
01:00:01.371 --> 01:00:02.420
I thought y'all was gonna be a good thing.

1013
01:00:02.420 --> 01:00:04.760
He didn't hit her but show cause I would have fucking leg whipped her,

1014
01:00:05.510 --> 01:00:09.210
which made me laugh so hard because she's his frail thing and if you like what

1015
01:00:09.211 --> 01:00:11.750
to you would have taken her legs Claire off like a helicopter blade.

1016
01:00:12.020 --> 01:00:15.650
I was belly laughing for five.
You will like a weapon.
This leg kicker.

1017
01:00:16.190 --> 01:00:19.760
I don't think I would have said,
okay,
well look scares me.
Well you got to um,

1018
01:00:19.940 --> 01:00:23.320
Kayla,
it,
someone punch you.
The real problem is like someone,
even a garage.

1019
01:00:24.350 --> 01:00:27.140
I saw you on the park.
You hurt your eye clip.
You in the pot.

1020
01:00:27.470 --> 01:00:31.340
I have a permanent dent in my face.
Yeah,
you can see it.
I have a permanent dent.

1021
01:00:31.400 --> 01:00:34.980
I don't,
she had a ring on.
Really?
There's a little dent there.
Yeah,

1022
01:00:35.030 --> 01:00:38.410
she probably had a ring on.
Yeah.
Someone could hit you in the other one down.

1023
01:00:38.440 --> 01:00:41.210
Joe's good for you.
That would have been embarrassing.
You,

1024
01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:44.710
you could lose your vision.
I mean that's 100% possible.
It happens.
People,

1025
01:00:44.780 --> 01:00:49.220
I had a slight concussion.
She really fucking caught me flooding.
I'm not shocked,

1026
01:00:49.221 --> 01:00:52.640
especially if you didn't know.
What would you have done?
I don't know.

1027
01:00:52.641 --> 01:00:55.340
I hope I wouldn't have done what I think I wouldn't know because you could lose

1028
01:00:55.341 --> 01:00:57.460
a lot of,
I know you get insurance for that and the,

1029
01:00:57.770 --> 01:00:59.780
the real problem is when you're not thinking,

1030
01:00:59.781 --> 01:01:01.880
when you get hit and then you immediately respond,

1031
01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:05.030
that's a real problem because look,
you've seen that video,

1032
01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:08.600
that giant six foot five guy who punched out 11 year old girl on the face.

1033
01:01:08.900 --> 01:01:11.930
She had a comment.
She,
well,
she definitely shit.
No,
I'm kidding.

1034
01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:15.650
Walked up to when it was with her and she definitely shouldn't have pushed him

1035
01:01:15.651 --> 01:01:16.071
first,

1036
01:01:16.071 --> 01:01:19.520
but he definitely shouldn't have punched her in the face is big giant fucking

1037
01:01:19.521 --> 01:01:24.410
guy.
I know with a nice shot.
You don't want,
you don't want to punch a girl.

1038
01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:26.060
You don't want to hit a girl and I didn't.
Don't,

1039
01:01:26.061 --> 01:01:29.570
you don't want to go into that reptilian part of your brain either that just

1040
01:01:29.571 --> 01:01:33.680
responds to being assaulted.
No,
that was killed.
That's dangerous.

1041
01:01:34.550 --> 01:01:35.970
I saw you that,

1042
01:01:36.020 --> 01:01:39.290
remember that clip years ago you were in the parking lot and the comedy store

1043
01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:40.580
arguing with some broad,
oh,

1044
01:01:40.581 --> 01:01:43.580
that feminists lady and I just mean I thought you were going to,
oh,
they're all,

1045
01:01:43.581 --> 01:01:45.390
I was trying to be nice to people on there.

1046
01:01:45.410 --> 01:01:48.140
I was nice to that lady for a long time until she's calling to tell him what

1047
01:01:48.141 --> 01:01:51.350
she's gonna.
She's gonna get hit me with her cigarette.
I'm like,
listen,

1048
01:01:52.070 --> 01:01:56.840
you're not doing anything.
I know I was watching it go.

1049
01:01:56.841 --> 01:01:57.830
What's going to happen next?

1050
01:01:57.920 --> 01:02:00.470
But it's just so stupid that people think they can get away with things like

1051
01:02:00.471 --> 01:02:02.600
that.
Well,
they can worldly.

1052
01:02:02.630 --> 01:02:06.080
It'd be if you were alone in a parking lot with their girl and she punched in

1053
01:02:06.081 --> 01:02:08.950
the face like that.
What if I even fucking cracker there?

1054
01:02:08.970 --> 01:02:11.240
What if I said that and I've been making this point.

1055
01:02:11.241 --> 01:02:13.790
You want true gender equality?
If we had it,

1056
01:02:13.791 --> 01:02:16.470
I could have fucking knocked her the fuck out and everybody went,
you know what?

1057
01:02:16.471 --> 01:02:20.010
She had it coming.
Yeah,
we all went home.
Well they would have been,
that's not the

1058
01:02:20.010 --> 01:02:23.970
<v 0>world we live where you showed amazing restraint and not hitting her back</v>

1059
01:02:23.971 --> 01:02:25.710
because I wasn't drinking and what,

1060
01:02:26.490 --> 01:02:30.210
what if you were drinking and I would've probably wrestled her at least cuffed

1061
01:02:30.211 --> 01:02:33.770
her and fire slap.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1062
01:02:33.970 --> 01:02:37.220
I would have gave her from behind though.
Like dirty one.
Oh,
dirty.
Yeah,

1063
01:02:37.380 --> 01:02:40.260
I would have came from here.
Do you ever see that?
You'll be sad video.

1064
01:02:40.650 --> 01:02:41.700
This is a kid,

1065
01:02:41.701 --> 01:02:45.390
a black kid walking down the street and some black neighbor and he's rapping

1066
01:02:45.391 --> 01:02:45.990
assumption shit.

1067
01:02:45.990 --> 01:02:49.950
And this black kid walks up behind like in a wife beater and winds up from his

1068
01:02:49.951 --> 01:02:51.450
ass hole with an open hand.

1069
01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:55.950
It would blow your brains out if you had the headphones.
But I uh,

1070
01:02:56.850 --> 01:03:00.240
I was proud of myself and that's why I was laughing after the incident.

1071
01:03:00.450 --> 01:03:04.280
People I know who've been telling me,
you know,
you know,
cool it a Weber,

1072
01:03:04.290 --> 01:03:07.820
you should keep it.
They were all like,
yeah,
shut off.
Fucking body slept

1073
01:03:09.870 --> 01:03:14.630
my arch.
Like you shut the fuck.
I was so proud of myself for once that I was,

1074
01:03:14.880 --> 01:03:18.930
I was the adult.
And the Rome and I,
I,
you know,

1075
01:03:18.931 --> 01:03:22.070
I know in the times will limiting in,

1076
01:03:23.210 --> 01:03:26.760
it wouldn't matter the circumstance if the toxic masculinity,
if,

1077
01:03:27.090 --> 01:03:30.630
if I croaked her.
Well,
I don't know man.

1078
01:03:30.631 --> 01:03:32.490
If somebody punches you and you punch them back,

1079
01:03:32.491 --> 01:03:36.780
I don't know what the fucking rules are.
I mean,
she's obviously very small.

1080
01:03:37.310 --> 01:03:39.180
That would've been a real problem because she's small,

1081
01:03:39.540 --> 01:03:41.160
but you shouldn't be fucking hitting people.

1082
01:03:41.161 --> 01:03:44.280
Now what you said you were working on it,
like you're still in the middle of it,

1083
01:03:44.281 --> 01:03:47.730
like what's going on with it?
Uh,
yes.
I uh,

1084
01:03:48.780 --> 01:03:53.640
pursuing it and they,
it's just so you can tell they don't give a fuck.

1085
01:03:54.150 --> 01:03:58.890
The Da was a woman in that county and now she's off the case.

1086
01:03:58.890 --> 01:04:03.150
For some reason they shuffled the,
um,
but they went,
they,
you know,

1087
01:04:03.180 --> 01:04:05.940
it should be a aggravated.
So,
but of course you can't go,

1088
01:04:05.941 --> 01:04:09.330
cause if you don't get that,
I can't sue her civilly.
If I lost that,

1089
01:04:09.331 --> 01:04:12.090
it would hurt my case.
At least that's the logic they would tell on me.

1090
01:04:12.300 --> 01:04:15.850
So they're trying to get her with like second degree harassment and now the,

1091
01:04:16.130 --> 01:04:18.710
there's a new woman on the case and she said they,

1092
01:04:18.750 --> 01:04:22.260
they're making her go to anger management and uh,

1093
01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:26.220
cause she has mental issues and uh,
I'm not looking for money.

1094
01:04:26.221 --> 01:04:31.010
I just want to make an example of her.
So,
but one,
why not pursue it as assault?

1095
01:04:31.130 --> 01:04:34.200
It's clearly assault.
I know.
Well you tell me.

1096
01:04:34.230 --> 01:04:38.640
So as your lawyers decision to not pursue it,
it's not,
no.
Nobody.
First of all,

1097
01:04:38.641 --> 01:04:42.990
nobody wanted to take the case because I'm fine.
Really?
Yeah.

1098
01:04:43.710 --> 01:04:47.400
They're like,
uh,
you sites not fucked up.
You're not in a wheelchair.
You're not.

1099
01:04:47.430 --> 01:04:50.940
But yeah.
Did I give the lowest credit for that much?
They are honest.

1100
01:04:50.941 --> 01:04:53.820
It's all about the money.
But that's crazy.
But I found the guy,

1101
01:04:53.880 --> 01:04:58.880
this Guy Andrew funk was a lawyer who was a marine and I said to he,

1102
01:04:59.051 --> 01:05:03.610
he contacted me and he put me in touch first with a Russian woman who,

1103
01:05:03.640 --> 01:05:06.690
who took about three of my calls and she get tired because it was no money

1104
01:05:06.691 --> 01:05:09.750
involved.
And he hooked me up on the ninth.
The Guy,
uh,

1105
01:05:09.751 --> 01:05:13.500
another lawyer who right now I'm dealing with,
but um,

1106
01:05:14.580 --> 01:05:14.881
yeah,

1107
01:05:14.881 --> 01:05:18.130
they will all right up front that if there's no money involved and you're not

1108
01:05:18.131 --> 01:05:20.160
permanently,
you're not going to,
you know,
but I just want,

1109
01:05:20.190 --> 01:05:23.600
I don't want money and this guy sort of a great meeting.
Sandra funk guys,

1110
01:05:23.630 --> 01:05:27.760
a marine,
he just wants to make an example.
She said I was racist and sexist,

1111
01:05:27.790 --> 01:05:31.960
you know.
Uh,
so I just want to make an exam.
I'm not looking for money,

1112
01:05:31.961 --> 01:05:35.350
but it's her father that really pisses me off.
She's nuts.

1113
01:05:35.980 --> 01:05:40.540
How old is just broads nuts?
Like 20,
21 goes to a school in upstate New York.

1114
01:05:40.541 --> 01:05:44.380
So she's not that,
not she lives on her own,
but it's the fucking old man

1115
01:05:45.880 --> 01:05:48.430
that was complicit in it.
I think he actually used her as,

1116
01:05:48.431 --> 01:05:49.570
as like a weapon that night.

1117
01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:52.630
It seems like it would be way harder to prove that she was,

1118
01:05:52.690 --> 01:05:56.230
that he was complicit in it would be to,
I agree with that.
She punched,
you know,

1119
01:05:56.231 --> 01:05:59.920
I agree.
But did she apologize ever?
Never.
She,
she,

1120
01:05:59.950 --> 01:06:03.550
she ran up into the lobby,
which is where he normally,

1121
01:06:03.551 --> 01:06:05.680
where you take pictures with fans and she didn't,
she,
she,

1122
01:06:05.681 --> 01:06:09.410
she put her head on the table and was crying after she realized what she'd done

1123
01:06:09.460 --> 01:06:13.390
or whatever,
you know,
they took it or like a psychiatric hospital.

1124
01:06:13.970 --> 01:06:17.620
So they're saying,
well,
you know,
so I,
I just want to make an example of her.

1125
01:06:17.621 --> 01:06:21.520
That's all.
I,
I don't,
I'm not looking for it,
but,
but uh,
you know,

1126
01:06:21.521 --> 01:06:26.010
that's ridiculous.
And the next time I will hit back,
you think,
yeah,

1127
01:06:26.290 --> 01:06:28.300
don't know.
Wait a minute,
Joe,

1128
01:06:28.301 --> 01:06:32.800
you confusing me now she's too little or give me a kick that would just like

1129
01:06:32.801 --> 01:06:37.360
hurt her ovaries,
ovaries,
all three of them.

1130
01:06:37.560 --> 01:06:42.200
Go for a knee.
Go for the lead as a pussy.
Be how you damage.

1131
01:06:42.201 --> 01:06:43.150
I don't want to lose my knee.

1132
01:06:46.810 --> 01:06:51.280
<v 3>I just would say don't hit her.
But
even in the future,</v>

1133
01:06:51.281 --> 01:06:53.840
if somebody does know I'm not,
I would,
I would never,
well,

1134
01:06:53.850 --> 01:06:56.560
you've approved dabbing or prove it because you haven't done it.

1135
01:06:56.800 --> 01:07:00.040
You didn't do it.
You had the ultimate opportunity.
So many actually hit you.

1136
01:07:00.041 --> 01:07:02.600
And you didn't hit him,
but it's one of my proudest moments.
Yeah,
it should.

1137
01:07:02.830 --> 01:07:03.760
It should be proud of that.

1138
01:07:03.970 --> 01:07:07.590
I've been straight into it with a fan of is somebody in the audience know?

1139
01:07:07.660 --> 01:07:11.110
I've been in twice.
One time at the comedy store.
Got threw a drink at me.

1140
01:07:11.860 --> 01:07:16.360
Holy Shit.
And how did you restrain yourself?
Um,

1141
01:07:16.810 --> 01:07:20.620
I don't remember.
I essentially invited him to get killed.

1142
01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:24.610
How'd you do that month?
Come on up here.
Come on up here.

1143
01:07:24.611 --> 01:07:29.050
I'll show you what's up and drink some asshole.

1144
01:07:29.590 --> 01:07:32.410
Who's him and his dad.
They were heckling everybody before the show.

1145
01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:35.470
Before I got on stage,
rather they were heckling everybody.

1146
01:07:35.620 --> 01:07:36.520
This is a long time ago.

1147
01:07:36.521 --> 01:07:41.521
It was probably 2003 2004 and knows who you are and he knows you're just a

1148
01:07:41.561 --> 01:07:45.580
pussy.
He just,
he just threw it my way,
you know,
we wanted to get famous.

1149
01:07:45.700 --> 01:07:48.940
Well he didn't even want to get famous.
There was no social media back then.

1150
01:07:49.060 --> 01:07:50.170
Not to speak of.

1151
01:07:50.171 --> 01:07:52.350
People aren't getting famous or things like that put in the paper.

1152
01:07:52.450 --> 01:07:57.220
He just a drunk asshole who interrupting comedy and the comedy store back then

1153
01:07:57.221 --> 01:08:01.930
had zero protection.
There was no police on the real cloud crowd room.
Right.

1154
01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:06.580
No crowd crowd control at all.
But yeah,
it's a fucking,

1155
01:08:06.581 --> 01:08:09.070
it's an issue with people,
the drinking.
Right.

1156
01:08:09.071 --> 01:08:11.740
And especially if you get crazy people that are drinking,
you know,

1157
01:08:11.790 --> 01:08:15.230
weird stuff can happen.
It's unfortunate.
Yeah.

1158
01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:19.820
<v 0>It's just,
you know,
people that don't have respect for performers to,</v>

1159
01:08:19.821 --> 01:08:22.130
they don't have respect for what you do and that it's difficult.

1160
01:08:22.280 --> 01:08:24.800
And if they disagree with you,
they think they are disagreeing.

1161
01:08:24.830 --> 01:08:27.830
Even if it's just a g you didn't even know where the joke is going.

1162
01:08:27.950 --> 01:08:31.910
They'll interrupt and they'll yell stuff out and they've just no,

1163
01:08:31.940 --> 01:08:34.160
no regard for the form that you're in.

1164
01:08:34.340 --> 01:08:36.770
The fact there's hundreds of other people that are there to see you.

1165
01:08:36.950 --> 01:08:41.950
It's about their mind and their selfish notion that they want to get out right

1166
01:08:42.051 --> 01:08:42.890
away and they,

1167
01:08:42.891 --> 01:08:46.700
and they have no idea how little it takes to throw off the balance of the room.

1168
01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:50.930
Oh yeah.
Just a slight confrontation.
Just see this talent.
Somebody to shut up.

1169
01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:52.400
And all of a sudden like,
you're the bad guy.

1170
01:08:52.940 --> 01:08:56.840
And a lot of times it's somebody right up front so they can hear.
Yeah.
You know,

1171
01:08:56.841 --> 01:08:59.720
and then it looks like it just scalding somebody for no reason.
Yeah.

1172
01:08:59.721 --> 01:09:02.960
I've had that though.
And I'm super sensitive.

1173
01:09:03.500 --> 01:09:08.000
Somebody farts in the 52nd row,
I can hear it and whatever I am,

1174
01:09:08.001 --> 01:09:12.260
I just have that,
you know?
Yeah.
Well,
you know,

1175
01:09:12.680 --> 01:09:17.570
I've learned,
I've into entire crowd.
No,
exactly.
Exactly.
I mean,
cause you,

1176
01:09:17.571 --> 01:09:19.670
do,
you study what's going on?
Uh,

1177
01:09:19.671 --> 01:09:23.060
you read their faces and whatnot and I'm really good at it.
And fucking,

1178
01:09:23.090 --> 01:09:27.740
if I see one person laughing out of 600 not laugh.
Yeah.
You've always been like,

1179
01:09:27.741 --> 01:09:28.850
no,
but I fixed it.

1180
01:09:29.590 --> 01:09:32.990
I fixed it years ago while after about 12 clubs said,
listen,

1181
01:09:32.991 --> 01:09:37.580
you've got to stop doing it.
I do,
but you know what?

1182
01:09:37.581 --> 01:09:42.530
I am so much better and not hitting her approved it.
I now I,
I,

1183
01:09:42.531 --> 01:09:46.760
uh,
I had a broad breakout that had nothing to do with me at Gotham a couple of

1184
01:09:46.760 --> 01:09:49.970
years ago.
What was it about two tables were fighting amongst each other.
Oh,

1185
01:09:49.971 --> 01:09:53.240
I heard about it was hilarious.
Talk about hitting a girl.

1186
01:09:53.241 --> 01:09:56.570
I just stood on the stage I love and I felt like Lenny Bruce,

1187
01:09:56.571 --> 01:09:59.010
who you get comics have a lot of Pumpkin us.
You know,
I had it,

1188
01:09:59.020 --> 01:10:03.290
but I didn't start this fucking broad breaks out.
I'm watching it.
Two tables,

1189
01:10:03.291 --> 01:10:06.740
girls and guys and there's a girl in the middle of their fists up like she took

1190
01:10:06.741 --> 01:10:10.150
three buck Tibo Class Bible classes.
She's,

1191
01:10:10.170 --> 01:10:13.190
and she takes a swing and hits one of the bounces.

1192
01:10:13.670 --> 01:10:18.290
I watch us out of the bounce and come across the room and dropped her like a

1193
01:10:18.291 --> 01:10:21.830
fucking use rubber.
I mean hit her like she was a guy.

1194
01:10:22.520 --> 01:10:27.230
Oh my God.
I don't know how this guy didn't do jail,
but these broads,

1195
01:10:27.231 --> 01:10:28.970
this is what this feminist movement has taken them.

1196
01:10:28.971 --> 01:10:31.880
Now they jump in every time you see a fight at a football game that stands is

1197
01:10:31.881 --> 01:10:36.200
women involvement.
Yet they really fucking think,
I'm sorry,

1198
01:10:36.201 --> 01:10:40.580
but legislation.
You can't fucking legislate the DNA out of us.

1199
01:10:41.090 --> 01:10:42.740
And uh,
they were always in the middle of it.

1200
01:10:42.741 --> 01:10:45.890
You notice that a lot of fucking broads think they can Duke it out now we'll do

1201
01:10:45.891 --> 01:10:49.940
our bunch.
Have a deletion.
But yeah,
they seem to many wonder woman movies.

1202
01:10:50.540 --> 01:10:52.400
Exactly.
They've been brainwashed.

1203
01:10:52.430 --> 01:10:55.100
Well there's a lot of people in general that think they could go around punching

1204
01:10:55.101 --> 01:10:56.770
people.
Like how about the all these,
uh,

1205
01:10:56.800 --> 01:11:01.520
Antifa dorks that are a show you face?
Well,
not only that,

1206
01:11:01.521 --> 01:11:04.420
they're starting fights with people and they have zero idea how to fight date.

1207
01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:06.410
They're swinging at people.
Did you see the one guy,

1208
01:11:06.690 --> 01:11:10.580
a guy swings at this guy with a bat or with a baton?

1209
01:11:10.760 --> 01:11:14.070
The guy catches the baton.
Eight punches him in the face and

1210
01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:18.180
<v 2>Kaos him and his head snaps back and his head bounces off the concrete.</v>

1211
01:11:18.181 --> 01:11:20.550
When he falls down.
It's awful to watch.

1212
01:11:20.551 --> 01:11:23.880
Like what the fuck made you think you could just hit a man with a stick?

1213
01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:27.600
Cause you guys disagree with each other and,
and you're right,

1214
01:11:27.601 --> 01:11:30.420
when they interview him after,
a lot of times they not even have to fight,

1215
01:11:30.421 --> 01:11:33.480
but they interviewed some of these Antifa.
They sound la almost swishy.
Yeah,

1216
01:11:33.570 --> 01:11:38.250
some of them swishy homosexual.
So we were saying fell that week of feminine.

1217
01:11:38.251 --> 01:11:40.890
Well they're,
they want to become a book.
Look,

1218
01:11:40.910 --> 01:11:44.630
the Antifa is just like any other group of people.
They,
they,

1219
01:11:44.690 --> 01:11:45.780
they give you a community,

1220
01:11:45.781 --> 01:11:50.300
whether it's a gang or whether it's a w w a criminal organization or what,

1221
01:11:50.370 --> 01:11:52.050
you know,
whatever it is,

1222
01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:57.320
people fall in line with the sensibilities of that organization and then you do

1223
01:11:57.331 --> 01:12:01.320
what you can to support that organization to show that you're a valued member.

1224
01:12:01.500 --> 01:12:02.251
And then,
you know,

1225
01:12:02.251 --> 01:12:05.220
you start wearing their fucking ski masks and hitting people with sticks and

1226
01:12:05.221 --> 01:12:08.310
everybody's practicing karate in the park because he thinks they're going to be

1227
01:12:08.311 --> 01:12:11.730
able to defend themselves.
The whole thing is ridiculous,

1228
01:12:11.731 --> 01:12:16.110
but because their life has no value outside of that.
Isn't it weird to do that?

1229
01:12:16.170 --> 01:12:16.500
Look,

1230
01:12:16.500 --> 01:12:20.520
my parents were hippies and when I grew up I always thought that people on the

1231
01:12:20.521 --> 01:12:23.700
left,
we're peace loving though.
That was what the,
the the,

1232
01:12:23.820 --> 01:12:26.220
the knock was there were peace,
loving,
well educated.

1233
01:12:26.430 --> 01:12:31.020
But you're seeing now people in the left,
like these certain factions of them.

1234
01:12:31.021 --> 01:12:34.110
Not all of them,
but people that are calling for violence,

1235
01:12:34.130 --> 01:12:37.010
they have violent pacifists.
Ironically.
Yes.

1236
01:12:37.050 --> 01:12:38.130
Well they don't want to do it themselves,

1237
01:12:38.131 --> 01:12:40.770
but they're calling you for other people to do,
right?
Yeah.
Right.

1238
01:12:40.920 --> 01:12:44.370
They're calling for people to get published.
Like that kid with the mag a hat,

1239
01:12:44.371 --> 01:12:47.190
like raise the Oslo on Ron.
Have you ever seen in more punchable face?

1240
01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.340
What the fuck are you saying?
Yeah.
You know,

1241
01:12:50.341 --> 01:12:55.341
it's like this extreme lack of empathy for young people to like young people

1242
01:12:55.651 --> 01:12:59.170
that,
that don't fall in line with their ideas.
They don't give a fuck,

1243
01:12:59.700 --> 01:13:03.420
fuck that kid punched him,
throw him in jail,
lock them up.
It's just like,
it's,

1244
01:13:03.421 --> 01:13:07.830
there's a lack of empathy and a lack of thought behind it.
It's,
it's very,

1245
01:13:07.860 --> 01:13:10.590
in social media is only throwing gas on that.
Yes.

1246
01:13:10.620 --> 01:13:14.670
And then you got these Russian accounts that are firing this up on both sides

1247
01:13:14.820 --> 01:13:16.650
that are attacking from the left and the right.

1248
01:13:16.770 --> 01:13:20.400
I think that's a way bigger issue than people think.
I think these,

1249
01:13:20.490 --> 01:13:24.600
these troll farms and these people that are setting up these fake accounts and

1250
01:13:24.601 --> 01:13:26.220
just getting people dialed up.

1251
01:13:26.610 --> 01:13:29.570
I think there's a lot of fucking lemmings out there and a lot of people just,

1252
01:13:30.030 --> 01:13:33.330
they fall into these arguments like how many people do you know that getting

1253
01:13:33.331 --> 01:13:36.020
involved in Twitter arguments and then they,
they,

1254
01:13:36.060 --> 01:13:39.630
they stew with those arguments all day.
They keep checking their mentions.

1255
01:13:39.810 --> 01:13:43.920
They get heavily involved with that.
If someone can get you involved in that,

1256
01:13:43.921 --> 01:13:48.180
like if the Russians can get a group of dummies involved in that kind of
dispute,

1257
01:13:48.300 --> 01:13:50.850
they could literally change the way people are interacting.

1258
01:13:50.851 --> 01:13:55.050
We chat with each other,
they're making the interactions more aggressive,

1259
01:13:55.051 --> 01:13:57.870
more violent.
So you think it's the Russian?

1260
01:13:58.020 --> 01:13:59.430
I think it has something to do with it.

1261
01:13:59.431 --> 01:14:02.220
I think there's a polarization between the left and the right period.

1262
01:14:02.370 --> 01:14:05.520
But I think they are definitely a class.
Yeah.
This,

1263
01:14:05.521 --> 01:14:08.640
this thing that I was reading or that listening to rather this Sam Harris'

1264
01:14:08.641 --> 01:14:12.190
podcast,
very fucking,
because they're,
they're talking

1265
01:14:12.190 --> 01:14:13.030
<v 3>about the,</v>

1266
01:14:13.060 --> 01:14:16.970
what we actually know about the data and where it's coming from and who,

1267
01:14:17.020 --> 01:14:20.650
how these people are doing this and how they're setting these things up.
Yeah.

1268
01:14:20.651 --> 01:14:25.390
That guy,
the comic that you and I talked about
again,

1269
01:14:25.391 --> 01:14:29.410
that clip of this Russian who was a former KGB guy who defected to this country

1270
01:14:29.440 --> 01:14:33.310
explaining how it works on back in the 80s yeah.

1271
01:14:33.400 --> 01:14:35.890
Explaining exactly how it works and what he was saying.

1272
01:14:35.891 --> 01:14:38.650
This is 30 something years ago.
35 years is going down.

1273
01:14:38.980 --> 01:14:43.120
Exactly the way he explained it,
and Putin is a Cajun Navy guy.
Oh,
Christ shit.

1274
01:14:43.180 --> 01:14:47.980
Yeah.
That's this idea that Trump's working with them as fucking silly.

1275
01:14:48.460 --> 01:14:49.810
Well,
I don't know about that.

1276
01:14:49.840 --> 01:14:52.270
I don't think he's working with them to undermine democracy,

1277
01:14:52.271 --> 01:14:54.520
but I definitely think they've got some business dealings.
I mean,

1278
01:14:54.521 --> 01:14:56.560
they were offering him to Trump.
That's not illegal.

1279
01:14:56.560 --> 01:14:59.740
The penthouse in Trump tower and illegal,
none of that is illegal.

1280
01:14:59.860 --> 01:15:01.940
Don't take that from me.
Take that from Alan Dershowitz.

1281
01:15:02.070 --> 01:15:04.930
Don't smarter than both of us.
I'm not saying it's illegal,

1282
01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:08.110
but I don't think that he was honest about that.
He said,

1283
01:15:08.111 --> 01:15:11.200
I don't do any dealings with Russia.
I don't have any business with Russia.

1284
01:15:11.230 --> 01:15:15.070
And he definitely did.
That's just not true.
Well,
we'll see.
We'll see.

1285
01:15:15.130 --> 01:15:17.750
That's what the targeting,
they're not going to get them a perennial.

1286
01:15:17.920 --> 01:15:22.570
You don't think so?
You think he's going to just,
Oh,
maybe impeachment,

1287
01:15:22.600 --> 01:15:25.060
but I'd even on,
on what k?
I don't even know what they'd get them.

1288
01:15:25.270 --> 01:15:26.830
High crimes and misdemeanors.
I don't,

1289
01:15:26.831 --> 01:15:31.720
I don't know what he's done to talk about building a tower in Moscow is not

1290
01:15:31.721 --> 01:15:36.670
illegal to have business and what he,
what did he lie about specifically?
Well,

1291
01:15:36.671 --> 01:15:40.320
there's a lot like what?
We could pull it up.
Let's,
let's find out all the things.

1292
01:15:40.330 --> 01:15:43.780
What are you?
Get a of salon.com or you can go to a million different websites.

1293
01:15:43.810 --> 01:15:47.490
Well,
I know we,
we just establish at the,

1294
01:15:47.570 --> 01:15:51.880
the fucking social media tilts lapse.
So yes,
social media does.

1295
01:15:51.881 --> 01:15:54.640
We're not talking about pulling up social media page.
What are you pulling up?

1296
01:15:54.670 --> 01:15:56.470
I don't know.
Actually,
she ain't gonna let me go.
I'm like,

1297
01:15:56.471 --> 01:16:00.850
I'm not a Trump scholar and haven't have at my disposal all the different times

1298
01:16:00.851 --> 01:16:04.210
that he'd lied.
But it's a lot.
So what do you think's going to happen to him?

1299
01:16:04.211 --> 01:16:08.380
You think he'll impeach him you mean?
No,
no.
He'll resign or what?
I don't know.

1300
01:16:08.920 --> 01:16:12.190
Look,
I'm not,
I'm not claiming to be any sort of an expert in legal proceedings.

1301
01:16:12.280 --> 01:16:15.810
I have no idea either.
That's why I quoted Dershowitz.
Yeah,
I think,

1302
01:16:16.150 --> 01:16:20.920
well isn't Hersh was working with Trump now Giuliani is,
oh that's right.

1303
01:16:21.120 --> 01:16:24.370
Dershowitz.
I always got a Dershowitz cause he's trucking Lib.

1304
01:16:24.430 --> 01:16:29.430
Trump average 15 and accuracies and ms truce a day 2018 almost triple the rate

1305
01:16:29.561 --> 01:16:32.690
from a year of hell.
Kay.
But hold on a second.
What's the demand?

1306
01:16:32.691 --> 01:16:37.510
They're season myths.
Truths.
It's a European paper.
But isn't that a little odd?

1307
01:16:37.540 --> 01:16:42.080
15 a day?
Cause I don't know is making that claim.
I don't know the exact year.

1308
01:16:42.110 --> 01:16:44.740
15 and accuracies.
You doubt that it's true.

1309
01:16:44.770 --> 01:16:49.390
You think that's all lie that just made up the fact that he lies a lot?
Uh,

1310
01:16:49.690 --> 01:16:53.380
lies about what?
First of all,
it's a definition of a lie.
I don't know.
Let's see.

1311
01:16:53.410 --> 01:16:57.850
It says Washington Post's who they hate those.
Yeah,
absolutely.

1312
01:16:57.851 --> 01:17:02.851
Say the president made 1,989 such claims in 2018 by the last day of 2018 in the

1313
01:17:04.271 --> 01:17:08.140
Washington does 17.
That's my point.
But what,
but let's wait and see what it says.

1314
01:17:08.170 --> 01:17:10.160
I mean they can't lie.
The total figures

1315
01:17:10.170 --> 01:17:15.140
<v 0>isn't to 7,600.
So you think they just made up all these lives?
Not all of them,</v>

1316
01:17:15.141 --> 01:17:18.590
I'm sure.
But you could,
you could go back with Hillary and fucking count.

1317
01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:21.690
You could go to uh,
go to Fox News and then put all that,
pull up an article.

1318
01:17:21.760 --> 01:17:25.240
How many times Hillary was inaccurate.
Do you know what a,
what about Islam is?
Uh,

1319
01:17:25.250 --> 01:17:26.230
what about him?
Yeah,

1320
01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:30.140
when someone talks about something and instead of refuting it with facts,
he go,

1321
01:17:30.141 --> 01:17:33.770
yeah.
Well what about Hillary?
What about bill?
Bill did a two.
What about this?

1322
01:17:33.771 --> 01:17:35.960
What about that?
You're going to sound,
what about Islam?

1323
01:17:36.010 --> 01:17:37.340
And that's what I just committed.

1324
01:17:37.341 --> 01:17:40.580
I was or one cause you were saying that Hillary lied,
but you both agree,

1325
01:17:40.581 --> 01:17:42.870
but you're making my point.
You're going into Washington pouch.

1326
01:17:43.220 --> 01:17:46.820
That's just Jamie pulled up the independent.
We could go,
we could go anywhere,

1327
01:17:46.850 --> 01:17:50.450
but hold on a second.
Yeah,
I'm with you.
I think Hillary is a liar.

1328
01:17:50.990 --> 01:17:53.450
I think she deleted 30,000 emails.
I think it's criminal.

1329
01:17:53.451 --> 01:17:57.740
I think the Clinton Foundation's,
uh,
uh,
a fucking fully illegal organization.

1330
01:17:57.890 --> 01:18:00.800
I think they rigged the DNC.
I think they,
they,

1331
01:18:00.801 --> 01:18:03.590
they rigged the primaries against Bernie.
I'm with you.

1332
01:18:03.770 --> 01:18:05.840
I'm not a supporter now I'm not saying you,
I,

1333
01:18:05.841 --> 01:18:10.310
but when's the last time somebody made a statement like that and said this many

1334
01:18:10.311 --> 01:18:14.920
inaccuracies when Bill Clinton was in office?
Hillary,
I'm sure,

1335
01:18:15.170 --> 01:18:17.390
I'm sure there was some inaccuracies,
but first of all,

1336
01:18:17.391 --> 01:18:21.830
when Bill Clinton was in office,
they weren't,
they count Obama's,
I don't know.

1337
01:18:21.831 --> 01:18:23.450
But that's what about Islam?
You know what I'm saying?

1338
01:18:23.451 --> 01:18:24.590
We're just talking about Trump.

1339
01:18:24.620 --> 01:18:27.620
You were saying that Trump doesn't lie and they're saying the lies.

1340
01:18:27.621 --> 01:18:31.600
I'm not saying he doesn't.
First of all,
he said,
what does he like?
No.

1341
01:18:31.640 --> 01:18:36.020
First of all,
you know,
I like to know the definition of a lie.

1342
01:18:36.020 --> 01:18:39.560
If he misstates something,
do you think it does it accidentally?

1343
01:18:40.370 --> 01:18:45.010
I'm sure sometimes when you talking that Mckay,
so if he's lies 1,900 time,

1344
01:18:45.011 --> 01:18:48.560
give me an example of a blatant.
Yeah,
that's fucking,
it's Washington Post.

1345
01:18:48.561 --> 01:18:51.680
It's horse shit.
I don't know I do you think

1346
01:18:53.920 --> 01:18:58.530
he said?
No,
he's a bullshitter.
For sure.
Joe,

1347
01:18:58.550 --> 01:19:01.280
would you argue that they haven't been trying to take him down since he came

1348
01:19:01.281 --> 01:19:04.250
down that fucking escalator?
How about the deep state?
How about,

1349
01:19:04.670 --> 01:19:08.630
how about the fucking dossier?
What?
Why is anybody know?
What does that mean?

1350
01:19:08.870 --> 01:19:11.780
The dossier.
What dossier?
The fake Das.

1351
01:19:11.781 --> 01:19:14.810
She had Christopher Steele that they use to get the,
the the Pfizer.

1352
01:19:16.060 --> 01:19:19.010
What you're talking about.
I just stand.
They know what I'm talking about.
No,
no,

1353
01:19:19.011 --> 01:19:20.810
no,
no they don't.
They don't cause I don't know.

1354
01:19:20.990 --> 01:19:24.030
What do you mean the dossier defect?
Josh matted.

1355
01:19:24.040 --> 01:19:26.550
They said they know what he's talking about.
They had,
yes,
they had.

1356
01:19:26.710 --> 01:19:29.230
You have to all this.
So you're being willfully ignorant.
Oh,

1357
01:19:29.250 --> 01:19:33.680
I don't know the Dick.
I don't know.
Hey,
I'm,
I'm explaining.
Hold on a second.

1358
01:19:34.550 --> 01:19:37.280
I've heard these are terms I've heard.
Yes.
And it's stuff,

1359
01:19:37.281 --> 01:19:38.770
but you don't know the full extent of this.

1360
01:19:38.771 --> 01:19:40.130
He had the oldest is what I'm talking about.

1361
01:19:40.131 --> 01:19:43.550
This is as big a story is anything Trump has done.
What is the story?

1362
01:19:44.240 --> 01:19:48.980
The Steele dossier that a Hillary used,

1363
01:19:49.580 --> 01:19:53.990
they went to,
you had to get a application to as a coach and they went,

1364
01:19:53.991 --> 01:19:57.590
they used a DNC opposites.
Christopher Steele,
who's a British guy,

1365
01:19:58.070 --> 01:19:59.600
had connections in Russia.

1366
01:19:59.990 --> 01:20:03.350
Remember when they said Trump was at a hotel and watching girls peeing on each

1367
01:20:03.351 --> 01:20:06.770
other?
That was all in the Steele dossier.
Christopher Steele is his name.

1368
01:20:07.050 --> 01:20:11.730
They use that in their application to get a Pfizer warrant to spy on Trump

1369
01:20:12.210 --> 01:20:16.980
during his campaign.
That's fact.
That's not me being a right winger.
That is fact.

1370
01:20:17.010 --> 01:20:21.750
Okay,
so,
but the fact that that like that you don't know that.

1371
01:20:22.050 --> 01:20:24.600
No,
I remember that now.
Oh,
that,
that's what I'm talking about.

1372
01:20:24.800 --> 01:20:27.510
When you were doing a story as Trump,
you know,

1373
01:20:27.511 --> 01:20:30.810
lying about the number of paper does inauguration.
I want to know the,

1374
01:20:31.110 --> 01:20:35.100
I want to know a live from Trump that's a equal,

1375
01:20:36.210 --> 01:20:38.660
equal in power as like when Obama said,

1376
01:20:39.120 --> 01:20:41.670
you know a lot about healthcare that you could keep your health care and all

1377
01:20:41.671 --> 01:20:44.730
that.
Give me an example of Trump.
Would that big of a lie?

1378
01:20:46.090 --> 01:20:48.190
<v 2>Well,
listen,
I told you I'm not,
it's a lie.</v>

1379
01:20:48.191 --> 01:20:51.070
I'm not saying it's as on president slide.
All politicians lie.

1380
01:20:51.360 --> 01:20:54.130
I'm just saying they start to count it.
When Trump took over,

1381
01:20:54.131 --> 01:20:57.850
they started keeping,
you know,
we'll be keeping statistics.
Like what?

1382
01:20:57.851 --> 01:20:59.110
Give me an example.
Like,
look,

1383
01:20:59.111 --> 01:21:02.530
we just showed you all the numbers of the Washington Post.

1384
01:21:02.531 --> 01:21:05.230
So if I give you another example,
you're going to say,
Oh,

1385
01:21:06.810 --> 01:21:10.350
if you go to a salon,
salon.com,
all right,
we'll go,
go to ou.

1386
01:21:10.390 --> 01:21:13.990
I don't know what you've gotten more done than any other administration.
Okay,

1387
01:21:14.020 --> 01:21:18.810
this is a lie.
So true,
blah,
blah,
blah.
See now,
so if somebody says it's a lie,

1388
01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.100
let's see what it says.
Jamie,
go back to it.
What are you doing?

1389
01:21:21.430 --> 01:21:24.930
But who's saying that's a lie?
Let's see.
Let's see.

1390
01:21:25.480 --> 01:21:28.210
Let's see what it says.
Jesus Christ.
You're so defensive.

1391
01:21:28.210 --> 01:21:31.040
It's like to work for the organization.
Now.
I don't,
but you're putting you,

1392
01:21:31.120 --> 01:21:34.910
I'm saying you're using the Washington Post.
This isn't the Washington.
Well,

1393
01:21:34.911 --> 01:21:39.850
what is it?
Oh,
the NBC.
Okay.
NBC.

1394
01:21:39.990 --> 01:21:43.750
Okay,
so,
and one is that,
look,
man,
I'm just reading what's in front of me.
I know.

1395
01:21:43.751 --> 01:21:46.190
And I'm just,
you're so emotional about this is ridiculous.

1396
01:21:46.200 --> 01:21:51.100
Four cups of coffee and Michelle had too,
Huh?
Oh,
please let me know.
I'm right.

1397
01:21:51.250 --> 01:21:53.190
I don't know your media tour.
We're talking to you.

1398
01:21:53.490 --> 01:21:57.400
Tell me you don't know that the mainstream media hates Trump.
They do.
I do.

1399
01:21:58.180 --> 01:21:59.710
Why would you put your fucking,

1400
01:21:59.860 --> 01:22:03.850
because I want to know whether or not they are saying,
but what is fat?
Stop.

1401
01:22:03.851 --> 01:22:06.610
Stop doing that.
Jamie.
Go back to where it was.
You can't go.

1402
01:22:06.611 --> 01:22:11.611
Says Trump later said that he intended the UN moment to garner a laugh that is

1403
01:22:11.981 --> 01:22:15.950
repeated this claim.
Seriously since.
Okay,
so he says that's my,

1404
01:22:16.740 --> 01:22:19.960
my administration has accomplished more than almost any administration in the

1405
01:22:19.961 --> 01:22:24.880
history of the country.
So this is just,
that's an expense.
That's hyperbole.
Right,

1406
01:22:24.960 --> 01:22:28.390
and people were laughing when he said that and so he was saying that he meant to

1407
01:22:28.391 --> 01:22:32.920
say it as a laugh.
There are hiring measures of success,

1408
01:22:33.100 --> 01:22:35.980
but it's not true that his administration has been more successful than any

1409
01:22:35.981 --> 01:22:39.250
other administration in history when it comes to legislation.
Trump aside,

1410
01:22:39.251 --> 01:22:42.460
plenty of bills in his first two years of President Barack Obama in his first

1411
01:22:42.461 --> 01:22:45.460
two years has significantly more science,
significantly more.
Okay.

1412
01:22:45.461 --> 01:22:47.320
This is just one thing.
I mean I'm sure there's many,

1413
01:22:47.321 --> 01:22:50.860
many other things that you can keep going over and over again.
I'm with you.

1414
01:22:50.920 --> 01:22:52.750
I'm not saying I'm not a bullshitter,

1415
01:22:52.780 --> 01:22:55.920
but I'm just saying all of a sudden they keep score when it,
when tried,

1416
01:22:55.921 --> 01:22:59.050
he's no more from my end that he keeps score because he lied so much.

1417
01:22:59.880 --> 01:23:03.640
Keep the who is keeping score and fucking Hillary was secretary of state.

1418
01:23:03.760 --> 01:23:06.070
Well it's the same secretary

1419
01:23:06.070 --> 01:23:09.090
<v 3>of state and I don't know how much she lied as opposed to how much he realize</v>

1420
01:23:09.100 --> 01:23:10.060
you're a lot bigger.

1421
01:23:10.120 --> 01:23:14.920
There's about her fucking server and about the Steele dossier that that is huge.

1422
01:23:14.921 --> 01:23:18.010
That is getting under cupboard like nobody's been that,

1423
01:23:18.220 --> 01:23:23.220
that dwarfs Watergate when they amass General Flynn that,

1424
01:23:24.611 --> 01:23:29.080
that,
that dwarfs Watergate.
Hmm.
That's an interesting conversation.

1425
01:23:29.140 --> 01:23:31.780
I don't know if that's the truth.
I don't know enough about Watergate,

1426
01:23:32.340 --> 01:23:37.070
but in an Ohio for about that either.
Okay.
Is it the coffee going on here?
Well,

1427
01:23:37.090 --> 01:23:39.390
yeah.
Why was in strung out?
Could we queen?
What do you want?

1428
01:23:40.170 --> 01:23:44.260
Freedom and emotional.
Not Emotional.
It's just I'm just you,

1429
01:23:44.270 --> 01:23:47.680
but you're acting as if I'm against you and I'm not against me.
Even if you were,

1430
01:23:47.681 --> 01:23:49.930
they'll be fine,
but yet I'm not,
you're not against me,

1431
01:23:49.931 --> 01:23:53.560
but I'm just saying to call Trump a big ally than the fucking,

1432
01:23:53.561 --> 01:23:56.830
every other politician is an exaggeration.
I don't know.

1433
01:23:56.831 --> 01:24:00.880
By the mainstream media who hates his guts.
I think most politicians are liars.

1434
01:24:00.940 --> 01:24:03.490
I think that just a lowly costume to doing that.

1435
01:24:03.491 --> 01:24:06.700
But I think the way he lies is unusual.

1436
01:24:07.840 --> 01:24:12.670
I think it's the usual.
It's just that unusual.
You don't think so.

1437
01:24:13.030 --> 01:24:17.560
He,
he exaggerates like statements like that because an exaggeration,

1438
01:24:17.830 --> 01:24:20.260
although he did do a lot in its first couple of years,

1439
01:24:20.261 --> 01:24:22.370
would never get credit for it.
You know,

1440
01:24:22.371 --> 01:24:25.560
unless you watched Fox knows you're not going to.
But um,

1441
01:24:26.800 --> 01:24:31.630
would you agree that as you get older you become more like more conservative?
No,

1442
01:24:31.631 --> 01:24:32.710
I was always a bit of a Dick.

1443
01:24:35.650 --> 01:24:39.990
I got a tattoo of mixing in my house.
Say I thought it was fun.
No,

1444
01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.910
I would say that was,
that's a fee.
What do they say about if you're young,

1445
01:24:43.360 --> 01:24:45.580
you're young and conservative,
you have no soul,

1446
01:24:45.610 --> 01:24:50.200
no heart and you're old and liberal.
Brilliance to mind.
Something like that.

1447
01:24:50.500 --> 01:24:55.210
Yeah.
I would say,
yeah,
that's true.
But I could always detect the bullshit,

1448
01:24:55.211 --> 01:24:56.200
you know?
I mean,
I mean,

1449
01:24:56.440 --> 01:24:59.740
I remember watching CNN in an airport and I first started comedy and it's like

1450
01:24:59.741 --> 01:25:03.430
1988 nine,
you know,
and getting excited at some of the shit.
Well,

1451
01:25:03.431 --> 01:25:04.840
it's interesting because,
uh,

1452
01:25:05.230 --> 01:25:09.040
I don't disagree with you on everything and I love you as a person.

1453
01:25:09.070 --> 01:25:11.350
You're a great guy.
I liked you a lot.
Always happy to see you.

1454
01:25:11.351 --> 01:25:15.070
But yet you and I here get a little heated and talking about this stuff,

1455
01:25:15.071 --> 01:25:18.250
but this is politics.
This is how divisive politics are.

1456
01:25:18.251 --> 01:25:22.180
If even a person like penny would never,
I would never fucking,

1457
01:25:23.050 --> 01:25:26.140
I would never leave here going,
I don't want to do that show again.

1458
01:25:26.980 --> 01:25:29.890
I have known each other.
We've known each other for 30 years.

1459
01:25:30.880 --> 01:25:31.870
That's not the problem.

1460
01:25:31.871 --> 01:25:35.290
What I'm saying is I'm just using it as example of how divisive politics.

1461
01:25:35.320 --> 01:25:39.970
Absolutely.
When people talk to him about it,
no,
I mean a lot of people are,
right?

1462
01:25:40.030 --> 01:25:42.340
Yes.
Yeah.
I,
I'm not afraid of it.

1463
01:25:42.580 --> 01:25:46.660
A lot of people are fade a bad vibes and bad feelings and this is one of the

1464
01:25:46.661 --> 01:25:50.500
days,
but this is one of the things that makes people tow the line,
right?

1465
01:25:50.520 --> 01:25:52.990
It's the fear of this kind of altercation,

1466
01:25:53.440 --> 01:25:57.760
the fear of this kind of like you don't want that from inside your party,
so you,

1467
01:25:58.060 --> 01:25:59.800
you start using they and them,

1468
01:26:00.130 --> 01:26:03.740
you start thinking that everyone should be able to use any bathroom that they

1469
01:26:03.741 --> 01:26:07.970
feel like they identify with.
You start,
you start going along the line.

1470
01:26:07.971 --> 01:26:11.420
It's one of the more interesting things about politics is that if you tell me

1471
01:26:11.600 --> 01:26:15.080
that you're Republican,
I can kind of guess your stance on God.

1472
01:26:15.081 --> 01:26:18.350
I can kind of guess your stance on being pro life pro choice,

1473
01:26:18.470 --> 01:26:19.610
second amendment rights.

1474
01:26:19.611 --> 01:26:22.760
It's like all those things sort of fall in line and it's very interesting.

1475
01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:26.330
It's very interesting how you,
you sort of adopt,
uh,
not you,

1476
01:26:26.331 --> 01:26:31.331
but people sort of adopt a whole group of things when you decide you're

1477
01:26:32.270 --> 01:26:36.550
Republican,
you decide you're a democrat.
I don't,
but yeah,

1478
01:26:36.551 --> 01:26:40.280
I don't think I fall into that.
Um,
how do you feel about guns?

1479
01:26:41.240 --> 01:26:45.830
Am what got any guns?
I'm going to get one.
Just one.

1480
01:26:46.170 --> 01:26:50.510
Yeah.
I,
I'm not a big gun guy.
Uh,
as far as a boy,
Shannon,

1481
01:26:52.280 --> 01:26:56.900
uh,
um,
I don't want to say pro choice,
but I'm not,
I'm not pro life.

1482
01:26:58.550 --> 01:27:01.700
One of the big reasons is if you,
like,
I got a dad is dying of Alzheimer's,

1483
01:27:02.300 --> 01:27:04.990
watching them.
It's the saddest thing.
If I could kill him tomorrow,

1484
01:27:05.060 --> 01:27:07.670
put them out of his misery,
I would,
I think you could take him to Oregon.

1485
01:27:08.880 --> 01:27:13.270
The states that allow that there are states,
um,
that uh,
allow people to,
um,

1486
01:27:14.190 --> 01:27:17.990
I think,
can I go over state lines with them?
Is it like taking a girl of a stale?

1487
01:27:18.080 --> 01:27:20.600
No,
there was a girl who was dying of cancer who,
uh,

1488
01:27:20.660 --> 01:27:25.040
went to Oregon for that very reason.
Yeah.
They're um,
Oregon is one of those,

1489
01:27:26.330 --> 01:27:27.950
I want to say,
I might be saying it wrong,

1490
01:27:27.951 --> 01:27:31.940
but I think the idea is a right to a dignified death.
No,
you're right.

1491
01:27:32.090 --> 01:27:34.850
Just read about.
Yeah.
Um,
look man.

1492
01:27:34.880 --> 01:27:37.850
The idea that you're supposed to just keep staying alive until your fucking

1493
01:27:37.851 --> 01:27:42.350
heart stops beating when silly,
horrible pain and it's,
it's,
it's evil.

1494
01:27:42.920 --> 01:27:45.950
You don't do it too.
I had to put my dog down.
Okay.
I love this dog.

1495
01:27:46.010 --> 01:27:49.070
I've had him for 13 years and I had to put him down because he couldn't walk

1496
01:27:49.071 --> 01:27:52.340
anymore.
Do you do chuck them out?
And I brought him to a place.

1497
01:27:53.300 --> 01:27:57.800
They actually came to my house actually and they put them down.
Sad Shit.
But,

1498
01:27:58.070 --> 01:28:02.570
but you can't do that for a 98 year old man who's falling apart.

1499
01:28:02.840 --> 01:28:07.160
You have to let him eventually stop breathing.
Right.
You know,
which is sad.

1500
01:28:07.790 --> 01:28:10.190
All the rights should go out the window.
That should be your first,
right.

1501
01:28:10.220 --> 01:28:12.050
It's your God damn life.
Yeah.

1502
01:28:12.200 --> 01:28:16.680
So that's why I couldn't be like pro choice pro in all pro life or whenever.
Uh,

1503
01:28:16.700 --> 01:28:17.301
and that,

1504
01:28:17.301 --> 01:28:19.940
and I got girls pregnant and I was younger and I was glad there was a planned

1505
01:28:19.941 --> 01:28:23.960
parenthood or whatever it was.
You know the guy in the alley with a stick.
I

1506
01:28:26.210 --> 01:28:28.950
think his name was Dave long as you answer.

1507
01:28:29.030 --> 01:28:32.080
I don't buy w w in show Biz Joe,
Eh,

1508
01:28:32.160 --> 01:28:34.640
you know it is in Showbiz cause this is a pretty liberal business.

1509
01:28:34.641 --> 01:28:38.090
If you are like,
if you're a right on to have 10 issues,

1510
01:28:38.380 --> 01:28:42.560
you're like a fucking Nazi,
you know.
I mean I get called alt right adjacent.

1511
01:28:42.770 --> 01:28:45.270
It's my favorite.
Oh my God.
They keep coming up with,

1512
01:28:45.510 --> 01:28:48.660
well you can't call me all right because I'm pretty left wing.
I'm mostly,

1513
01:28:49.710 --> 01:28:52.310
they call it so they call me outright adjacent probably because I have people

1514
01:28:52.311 --> 01:28:53.180
like you on now.

1515
01:28:53.181 --> 01:28:57.230
I'm going to be more outright adjacent cause you cause you isn't that silly.

1516
01:28:57.740 --> 01:29:02.070
You have me on to,
you know,
your listeners probably,
you know,
like you'll

1517
01:29:02.080 --> 01:29:03.000
<v 0>like listen to this guy.</v>

1518
01:29:03.001 --> 01:29:05.370
I don't agree with anything that should be a feather in your cap.

1519
01:29:05.520 --> 01:29:08.200
And they're gonna hold that against you.
Yeah.
Silly.

1520
01:29:08.490 --> 01:29:12.510
<v 2>Well,
you know,
to the,
it's not rational,
but again,</v>

1521
01:29:12.511 --> 01:29:17.010
it's people trying to have an effect on you.
They're trying to have an effect.

1522
01:29:17.130 --> 01:29:19.800
They're trying to make some ways try and do something.

1523
01:29:19.980 --> 01:29:24.450
The writing blogs or creating videos while they're doing it to try to put

1524
01:29:24.451 --> 01:29:27.450
pressure on you.
It's interesting though.
It's weird.

1525
01:29:27.451 --> 01:29:29.310
It's weird from a psychological perspective.

1526
01:29:29.311 --> 01:29:31.930
You're looking at it from the outside.
You know,
it's,
it's,
uh,

1527
01:29:32.790 --> 01:29:34.380
it's disconcerting when it's happening to you,

1528
01:29:34.381 --> 01:29:37.020
but when you step back and look at it like,
it's interesting.

1529
01:29:37.021 --> 01:29:40.830
It's like the systems are opposing each other and they're trying to figure out

1530
01:29:40.860 --> 01:29:45.150
where the weaknesses are and how to,
how to push to affect the other side.

1531
01:29:45.280 --> 01:29:49.630
<v 0>Yeah.
And it's not,
and it's not just left.
Right.
You know,</v>

1532
01:29:50.890 --> 01:29:54.950
it's bigger than that.
So,
you know,
what was the book I read?
Um,

1533
01:29:56.110 --> 01:29:59.410
what's the place where they go to meet every year?
Bohemian Grove,

1534
01:30:00.820 --> 01:30:03.970
the group build the bird grope.
That was one of my favorite books.

1535
01:30:04.090 --> 01:30:07.490
The truth about the Bilderberg group and um,

1536
01:30:07.780 --> 01:30:12.730
what goes on there and the powerful people that meet and uh,
people,

1537
01:30:12.731 --> 01:30:16.570
I was saying it's probably 10 guys in a room that run the whole fucking well,

1538
01:30:16.571 --> 01:30:20.050
okay.
But you show me them until then I'll stay in the left.
Right.

1539
01:30:20.051 --> 01:30:21.610
Fight and have fun.
Right.

1540
01:30:21.611 --> 01:30:25.000
The idea is that there's 10 guys to control everything and they don't give a

1541
01:30:25.001 --> 01:30:27.910
fuck if it's left or right.
They're just about money.
It's,
yeah.

1542
01:30:27.950 --> 01:30:31.990
But led the round house fellows were involved and,
and they,
but it's weird.

1543
01:30:32.130 --> 01:30:35.080
That was really creep.
They plan shit out decades ahead.

1544
01:30:35.100 --> 01:30:39.820
And did they plan out education?
Yeah.
Decades ahead though.
And,

1545
01:30:39.840 --> 01:30:44.650
and it comes true like they write a sitcoms script at that lasts for 15 years.

1546
01:30:44.700 --> 01:30:48.100
W with plot points.
It was,
that buck was incredible.

1547
01:30:48.101 --> 01:30:53.050
I can't remember the author's name,
but um,
yeah,
but I don't,
I don't,
I don't mind.

1548
01:30:53.440 --> 01:30:55.240
I used to sit at that table at the comedy cellar.

1549
01:30:55.241 --> 01:30:56.770
That's how tough crowd came about.

1550
01:30:57.220 --> 01:30:59.470
Me and Patrice yelling at each other about Rachel's Shit.

1551
01:31:00.700 --> 01:31:02.230
Tough crowd was a great fucking show.

1552
01:31:02.231 --> 01:31:05.920
But I really am worried that you couldn't have a show like die.
No,
you should be.

1553
01:31:06.170 --> 01:31:08.650
Now let me ask you,
and I'm not taking left,
right,

1554
01:31:09.270 --> 01:31:13.870
but who would be to blame for that?
That that's why I lean.
Right.

1555
01:31:14.320 --> 01:31:18.910
And I think,
and you do in some areas,
you're in a,
I mean,

1556
01:31:18.911 --> 01:31:21.820
you're an artist.
You're a stand up.
I cannot be,

1557
01:31:21.821 --> 01:31:26.680
I cannot vote with a party that is 4 cents a share.
And,

1558
01:31:26.681 --> 01:31:27.910
and for group things.

1559
01:31:28.060 --> 01:31:30.070
<v 2>Did we ever find out what's going on with Dennis Prager?</v>

1560
01:31:30.130 --> 01:31:33.710
Did we get a line on that?
Because that's still bothering you.
No,
no.
I just,
I,

1561
01:31:33.760 --> 01:31:36.550
it does bother me because I liked the guy.
He's great.
He's,

1562
01:31:36.551 --> 01:31:39.820
I don't agree with him on a lot of things,
but he seems like a very nice guy.

1563
01:31:39.821 --> 01:31:40.720
And I like Adam.

1564
01:31:41.170 --> 01:31:45.910
<v 0>I do tow both those guys.
It,
there's a lawsuit,
he's bringing a lawsuit that,
uh,</v>

1565
01:31:45.940 --> 01:31:48.180
they think it's going to go a long way.
There's,

1566
01:31:48.190 --> 01:31:51.520
cause they were labeling his show is hate speech.
Maybe it's back up or whatever.

1567
01:31:51.521 --> 01:31:53.770
But I know that story,
you can find that anywhere.

1568
01:31:53.780 --> 01:31:58.780
<v 2>There's a real concern that the ideologies behind these tech companies all go in</v>

1569
01:31:59.290 --> 01:32:00.070
direction and

1570
01:32:00.070 --> 01:32:04.390
<v 3>they have the overwhelming control of the narrative because of the fact that</v>

1571
01:32:04.630 --> 01:32:08.050
they're all,
what we're,
we're,
we're getting all of our information.

1572
01:32:08.051 --> 01:32:09.520
Most people are getting it on their phones.

1573
01:32:09.790 --> 01:32:12.850
Most people are getting a lot of their media on their phones.

1574
01:32:12.880 --> 01:32:17.530
The Netflix said something like 50% of the people that watch my special watch it

1575
01:32:17.531 --> 01:32:20.830
on a phone.
That's amazing.
I mean,
that's crazy that people are,

1576
01:32:20.920 --> 01:32:23.350
so all of this stuff is coming from these tech companies.

1577
01:32:23.400 --> 01:32:26.020
Doesn't have then that kind of bother you that it's the phone.

1578
01:32:26.530 --> 01:32:30.720
Because when I hear that,
not that it matters of my specials,
but um,
uh,

1579
01:32:31.060 --> 01:32:33.640
when I picked somebody's watching something and I've found you don't have their

1580
01:32:33.641 --> 01:32:36.210
full attention,
they're doing other things.
Yeah.

1581
01:32:36.230 --> 01:32:38.650
I mean as opposed to sitting in front of their computer or TV.

1582
01:32:38.860 --> 01:32:41.800
That kind of bug you.
You put all that work into it and they're,

1583
01:32:41.810 --> 01:32:44.170
they're on the subway watching it and the,

1584
01:32:44.910 --> 01:32:49.230
I don't pay attention to when I can control.
I don't that to make me nuts.
Yeah,

1585
01:32:49.231 --> 01:32:53.060
I got to get over there.
That's where the Muslims,

1586
01:32:53.610 --> 01:32:57.130
I love it.
I'm going to have to try the little one.
I'll give you a little one.

1587
01:32:57.131 --> 01:33:00.280
Just that one step a day.
I get to drive to San Diego.
I was perfect.

1588
01:33:01.850 --> 01:33:05.470
Me and traffic.
Well,
what time is your show?

1589
01:33:05.740 --> 01:33:09.620
I know I'm fucking going to be times you show at seven 30 it's full.
I,

1590
01:33:09.630 --> 01:33:13.180
I pulled up on ways that says if I leave at three it's going to take four hours.

1591
01:33:14.080 --> 01:33:18.380
Oh,
you better leave it to then it's almost kicked me out of

1592
01:33:20.070 --> 01:33:23.420
the coffee,
but then I just drove there last week for Brendan shops.

1593
01:33:23.421 --> 01:33:25.510
Specially tee shot a showtime special.
How long did,

1594
01:33:25.511 --> 01:33:27.400
it took me five and a half hours to get down there.

1595
01:33:28.100 --> 01:33:31.060
It took me fucking ever flying.
I didn't want to.

1596
01:33:31.061 --> 01:33:32.110
I was in bringing up before the show.

1597
01:33:32.111 --> 01:33:35.760
I thought I saw you got to show there tonight.
My managers,
my manager.
Yeah.

1598
01:33:36.540 --> 01:33:39.190
My man,
his thought he's doing me a favor.
Just pull it up in Google.

1599
01:33:39.191 --> 01:33:42.790
Just go all the way now.
Yeah,
we'll Google do it too.

1600
01:33:42.791 --> 01:33:46.210
If you just Google a Wicca.
Where's the Gig?
Where yet?

1601
01:33:46.800 --> 01:33:51.700
A comedy palace.
Eight ladies.
Don't punch him.
Now.
You know where he is.

1602
01:33:53.090 --> 01:33:55.590
Don't show up and day.
You're going to throw that fucker.

1603
01:33:56.460 --> 01:34:01.080
You're racist piece of shit.
You fucking sexist.
You hate women feminists.

1604
01:34:02.560 --> 01:34:05.680
Oh it is.
It's a fucking,
it's a Udall uterine cancer.

1605
01:34:06.550 --> 01:34:10.520
Females of the future.
The future's feminine.
I'll take my life tonight.
That's

1606
01:34:12.280 --> 01:34:17.140
filthy horse anyways to fucking Harry thick ankle girls that can't get laid and

1607
01:34:17.141 --> 01:34:19.120
they turn their Angus.
Some of them is pretty,

1608
01:34:19.121 --> 01:34:22.360
they just haven't met a stripper who's a feminist yet.
Oh Wow.

1609
01:34:22.620 --> 01:34:26.140
And I've talked to almost to have in the last 40 years,
three 45 right now.

1610
01:34:26.170 --> 01:34:30.460
Three hours and 43 hours and 45 minutes.
Okay.
If you leave right now,

1611
01:34:30.461 --> 01:34:32.680
you get there an hour before the show.
You kicking me out.

1612
01:34:34.120 --> 01:34:37.210
I think don't make me come across what I'm nervous about and I'm just being

1613
01:34:37.211 --> 01:34:38.044
honest,

1614
01:34:38.700 --> 01:34:43.700
but when I'm nervous about is that it's gonna get worse seemingly longer in the

1615
01:34:44.300 --> 01:34:44.861
next hour.
Do you understand?

1616
01:34:44.861 --> 01:34:49.650
It's making me nervous that you are nervous because I was the one who's going
to,

1617
01:34:49.670 --> 01:34:51.280
I'm going to have to get out of here a little early.
I thought you've got to go.

1618
01:34:51.281 --> 01:34:52.930
You'll be fine.
You'll fucking good dude.

1619
01:34:52.931 --> 01:34:56.200
I got down to San Diego on Saturday night.
I was delirious.

1620
01:34:56.370 --> 01:34:58.190
I had been smoking and fucking

1621
01:34:59.490 --> 01:35:02.900
<v 0>it's the fumes from the highway cause everything was stop and go the whole way</v>

1622
01:35:02.940 --> 01:35:04.580
that might want to try to catch a flight if you can.

1623
01:35:04.670 --> 01:35:06.920
The only thing that saved me was gone to the fucking airport.

1624
01:35:06.980 --> 01:35:09.590
We're under the Washer that yet.
I would rather walk.

1625
01:35:09.860 --> 01:35:14.190
Run the jewels is the only thing that saved me.
He's rocking out my car.
It was a,

1626
01:35:14.280 --> 01:35:17.270
it was a horrible drive.
Yeah.
Well the whole world lives here.

1627
01:35:17.271 --> 01:35:19.010
Of course it's going to be horrible.
No.

1628
01:35:20.340 --> 01:35:24.890
The real Americans live in the middle tone thing.
Jesus land.
Yeah.

1629
01:35:25.100 --> 01:35:27.650
The fly over states live in Ohio.
What do you like to work?

1630
01:35:27.830 --> 01:35:30.410
Where's your favorite place to perform?
That's where I'm going to get you.

1631
01:35:31.170 --> 01:35:34.430
San Francisco.
I love San Francisco.
I'm kidding.
I haven't been there in years.

1632
01:35:36.500 --> 01:35:40.280
They loved me when I was in the cockpit because they didn't look happy that

1633
01:35:40.281 --> 01:35:43.340
someone's like bucking the trends.
Right?
Well that's how it used to be,

1634
01:35:43.341 --> 01:35:45.650
but that's how left wing and then fucking stupid dip.

1635
01:35:45.651 --> 01:35:48.990
Turn it to Bobby Slayton could've run for mayor of San Francisco,
right?
Yeah.

1636
01:35:49.580 --> 01:35:52.220
Does he still play up there?
I have not seen.
They loved me.

1637
01:35:52.221 --> 01:35:53.660
I almost won that competition.

1638
01:35:53.661 --> 01:35:56.570
They have me at the punchline twice a year for like three years.

1639
01:35:56.780 --> 01:36:00.450
I love the punchline and then all of a sudden,
you know,
and I'll go,
no,

1640
01:36:00.470 --> 01:36:03.590
but I don't.
Uh,
what's tough,
people always say they,

1641
01:36:03.591 --> 01:36:06.410
I bet you you killed down south and Atlanta.
No,
those people are,

1642
01:36:06.620 --> 01:36:09.830
they all have guilt complexes about being racist and bigots.

1643
01:36:09.831 --> 01:36:11.510
So when you do something off color,
they like,

1644
01:36:11.640 --> 01:36:14.810
they'll laugh and under their cowboy hats.
What about like Cleveland?

1645
01:36:15.650 --> 01:36:19.910
Cleveland's a top one for me.
They don't have the,
like I,
I they don't have like,

1646
01:36:20.090 --> 01:36:24.530
I don't know.
My sarcasm is almost too too,
they're almost to Midwest for me.

1647
01:36:26.390 --> 01:36:29.150
You know what I mean?
Honest to God really have about Columbus.

1648
01:36:29.420 --> 01:36:32.930
I don't do a Columbus.
Why don't you do Columbus?
I don't know.

1649
01:36:32.931 --> 01:36:35.930
Artie Lange got in trouble for fucking doing black jokes there.

1650
01:36:37.250 --> 01:36:41.780
I don't do black jokes.
I'm just saying,
I don't know.
So I e land got in trouble.

1651
01:36:41.781 --> 01:36:44.390
This,
you're like,
oh scratch that danger.

1652
01:36:44.420 --> 01:36:48.200
Lack prob by black bounce a complaint because he did a black joke and Michael,

1653
01:36:48.201 --> 01:36:52.670
that sounds like a great club.
Yeah.
Which club is this?
The funny bone.
Yeah.

1654
01:36:53.060 --> 01:36:56.480
That's a great fucking club.
I know.
I'll get there.
Get over there.
I will go.

1655
01:36:56.600 --> 01:37:00.790
I'll get there.
No,
cause it's changed a lot since um,
I just said,

1656
01:37:00.810 --> 01:37:04.520
because I thought I want to do small theaters,
Joe,
I don't want to do clubs.
Okay.

1657
01:37:04.860 --> 01:37:09.650
Yeah.
I'm doing this to cover the cost to come on out here tonight and I'm doing

1658
01:37:09.651 --> 01:37:12.500
Ventura Harbor Comedy Club Cause I,
oh,
that's a good spot.
It's fun.

1659
01:37:12.530 --> 01:37:16.580
That Chinese restaurant,
hold on.
What's an actual club upstairs?
Yeah,

1660
01:37:16.820 --> 01:37:20.300
it's a Chinese restaurant.
It is not.
It's a comedy club.
I worked at,

1661
01:37:20.900 --> 01:37:23.900
what do you mean Chinese restaurants and it's connected to a Chinese Chinese

1662
01:37:23.901 --> 01:37:25.910
food there.
Oh,
it's connected to a rent.

1663
01:37:25.911 --> 01:37:29.120
It's still not make it sound like I'm standing in the kitchen.
I've worked there.

1664
01:37:29.520 --> 01:37:32.900
Cheap books coming up the fuck.
It's a good spot.
I love it.

1665
01:37:33.080 --> 01:37:35.810
So I'm doing that Sunday.
I'm not scared to wear to a Chinese restaurant.

1666
01:37:35.811 --> 01:37:40.070
Is this coming up?
This is the dream.
Live comedy panel.
And come see you.

1667
01:37:40.071 --> 01:37:43.610
I'm counting on it cause I did not JDL polishing their knuckles right now.
Good.

1668
01:37:43.760 --> 01:37:47.290
I'm fucking,
I have two knives in my car.
Can I bring that Samurai thing?

1669
01:37:48.380 --> 01:37:50.030
Can I bring that 1500 year old school?

1670
01:37:50.031 --> 01:37:52.470
I want to give you some sort of protection.
I don't want to give you a weapon.

1671
01:37:52.520 --> 01:37:56.430
Please.
I can do 12 deep knee bends.
Nobody's gonna fuck with me out.

1672
01:37:57.270 --> 01:38:01.880
<v 3>Um,
what about for 57?
I'm hanging you.
I'm hanging in there,</v>

1673
01:38:01.890 --> 01:38:04.980
especially for no hormone replacement.
I tried to get you on the sauce.

1674
01:38:05.610 --> 01:38:10.430
You don't think that's my first call?
Me?
Yeah.
I'll look you up again.

1675
01:38:10.560 --> 01:38:12.150
Get you to the doctor.
They'll take care of you.

1676
01:38:12.420 --> 01:38:15.810
Figuring out what your blood levels are at kitchen on the right vitamins.

1677
01:38:15.920 --> 01:38:18.580
Doctor in New York,
right?
Oh,
for sure.
Yeah.

1678
01:38:18.600 --> 01:38:23.550
There's a lot near you can to get you off of these though.
Get John to these,

1679
01:38:25.160 --> 01:38:28.760
but he got the marijuana.
Yeah,
I know.
I heard it at the marijuana.

1680
01:38:28.770 --> 01:38:31.830
It doesn't help you go to sleep or something.
Aren't you one of those guys now?

1681
01:38:31.831 --> 01:38:34.230
I can't help.
Remember I took a,
I took one eighth edible.

1682
01:38:34.630 --> 01:38:36.120
It was like doing acid for me.

1683
01:38:36.600 --> 01:38:38.740
I was watching Bob Newhart and all of sudden I was in this,

1684
01:38:38.970 --> 01:38:43.050
in this fucking show and it was in black and wife and my wife was not my wife

1685
01:38:43.051 --> 01:38:45.420
and my house was not my house.
I get all this stuff.

1686
01:38:45.570 --> 01:38:49.320
This is from a little bit of an edible.
Those are strong.
They're making them,

1687
01:38:49.380 --> 01:38:52.650
they're making them strong.
They're doing horrible things to people out here.

1688
01:38:52.800 --> 01:38:56.490
But now they have new rules where each edible has to be 10 milligrams,

1689
01:38:56.940 --> 01:39:00.810
which is doable.
But here's the thing,

1690
01:39:01.180 --> 01:39:04.560
ain't nobody measuring those fucking things.
How about the CBD Shit?

1691
01:39:04.561 --> 01:39:06.880
Joe Cbd is Great.
I know.
I,

1692
01:39:07.070 --> 01:39:10.590
I went into a bar in New York and the bath and it pushed it on me.

1693
01:39:10.591 --> 01:39:14.130
They were like,
he had like a campaign gone.
And uh,

1694
01:39:14.150 --> 01:39:17.460
the problem was I had already had a couple drinks so I couldn't tell,

1695
01:39:17.461 --> 01:39:20.790
but I slept good when I took it.
Yeah.
CBD is amazing.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1696
01:39:20.791 --> 01:39:23.490
Some of it has a little bit of [inaudible],
but it's very little.

1697
01:39:23.850 --> 01:39:24.930
Most of it is very little,

1698
01:39:24.931 --> 01:39:28.050
but it's really good for your joints and for aches and pains,

1699
01:39:28.350 --> 01:39:31.080
inflammation and stuff like that.
For a lot of people,
it's good for anxiety,

1700
01:39:31.530 --> 01:39:34.380
you know,
I don't have any of that.
Seems cool as a cucumber.
Wow.

1701
01:39:34.381 --> 01:39:38.910
Amazing cigarettes.
Amazing.
That's what keeps me cool.

1702
01:39:38.970 --> 01:39:43.210
What about Texas?
Do you like work at Texas?
Yes,
I be,

1703
01:39:43.290 --> 01:39:46.230
I gotta be honest.
I haven't been in a do these places in a while,
but yes.
Uh,

1704
01:39:46.320 --> 01:39:48.130
and I'll go to Texas.
No,
I did.
I was just,

1705
01:39:48.270 --> 01:39:53.270
I wasn't Dallas and some of the jokes that make people cringe elsewhere.

1706
01:39:54.211 --> 01:39:58.470
We're getting rounds of applause
in Dallas.

1707
01:39:58.980 --> 01:40:02.230
Anytime I said Joe just,
you know,
not in a hateful way.
It might fuck tonight,

1708
01:40:02.490 --> 01:40:06.360
but you know,
you say Jew and it's nice.
Say it in a way.

1709
01:40:06.361 --> 01:40:10.290
It sounds hateful that south,
that's where [inaudible] does a bit about that.

1710
01:40:10.291 --> 01:40:13.260
And I owe you,
I used to ask Louis when we lived together,
I go,

1711
01:40:13.261 --> 01:40:16.020
how can we first moved to New York?
I said,
I hear people saying,
yeah,

1712
01:40:16.050 --> 01:40:19.530
he's a Joe or whatever and nobody gets mad and stuff because in Boston if

1713
01:40:19.531 --> 01:40:23.190
somebody said he had back in jail,
uh,
but um,

1714
01:40:23.220 --> 01:40:27.960
but Dallas was great for me.
So Dallas is great.
Houston Houston's great.

1715
01:40:28.170 --> 01:40:32.280
Austin's great.
Texas is the shit you used to.
And I did an album in Houston.

1716
01:40:33.740 --> 01:40:37.060
Did you do it at the last fac laugh stop in river oaks?
Yes.

1717
01:40:37.770 --> 01:40:41.520
I did an album that more.
Nah,
Dan not,
that was well that was,

1718
01:40:42.980 --> 01:40:47.790
yeah.
What is it now?
Um,
sometimes like they'll have shows.
There's sometimes,

1719
01:40:47.820 --> 01:40:51.360
I think someone had something there for awhile.
I don't know the full story,

1720
01:40:51.361 --> 01:40:54.460
but that was one of the greatest clubs ever laugh.
Stop in river oaks.

1721
01:40:54.660 --> 01:40:56.920
Remember that crazy dude was running at the fuck's his name?
Yeah.

1722
01:40:57.620 --> 01:41:01.480
Fuck's his name?
Bald guy?
Yes.
Mark.
Yes.

1723
01:41:01.870 --> 01:41:06.100
Yeah.
Last name.
Oddly enough.

1724
01:41:06.670 --> 01:41:11.290
Joey knew him.
Wheelwell real well.
I forgot about that.
Yeah,
yeah.
Yes.

1725
01:41:11.291 --> 01:41:15.240
And that was bill Hicks.
Yeah.
Place Day.
Had a fucking legit open,

1726
01:41:15.260 --> 01:41:19.450
moping in the fucking end.
The front.
And it was legit.

1727
01:41:19.740 --> 01:41:24.670
Dude comics.
I watched it.
I got these kids are open.
They were Euston,
right?

1728
01:41:24.700 --> 01:41:29.050
Yup.
Houston is a very eclectic city.
It's really different.

1729
01:41:29.170 --> 01:41:32.200
It's not what people think of when they take a Houston that take a cowboy hats

1730
01:41:32.201 --> 01:41:36.520
and old.
No,
it's not.
It's very diverse.
There's a lot going.
It was a very urban,

1731
01:41:36.521 --> 01:41:41.290
there's a lot of cool shit going on in Houston.
Very artistic.
I'm a big fan.
Yeah.

1732
01:41:41.890 --> 01:41:44.590
Same with like,
you know,
people always call,
you must kill an Atlantic.

1733
01:41:44.610 --> 01:41:46.420
And I'm like,
no,
they,
they're,
they're PC.

1734
01:41:46.421 --> 01:41:51.070
They're act cosmopolitan areas for the most part.
Yeah.
You don't kill in Atlanta.

1735
01:41:51.170 --> 01:41:55.960
I kill if I want to,
but some of the shit that you thought,

1736
01:41:55.961 --> 01:41:59.420
but some of the stuff you think would kill,
you know,
they'd get to,
it's like,
eh,

1737
01:42:00.550 --> 01:42:04.150
even for us down here.
Right.
But that,
you know,

1738
01:42:04.151 --> 01:42:08.260
cosmopolitan areas is more a,
you know,
what about Phoenix?
Phoenix is a,

1739
01:42:08.261 --> 01:42:12.190
gets Phoenix is good.
That's a great,
yeah.
Yeah.
There's a few great spots.

1740
01:42:12.191 --> 01:42:15.880
If you didn't live in New York,
where would you live for comedy purposes?

1741
01:42:15.890 --> 01:42:20.890
It just to life in comedy for life and comedy.
Yeah.
Burlington,
Vermont.
Really?

1742
01:42:20.891 --> 01:42:24.400
No,
I'm kidding.
If I could be up there with fucking Ben and Jerry.
No,

1743
01:42:24.550 --> 01:42:28.230
I would Bernie's dealer night boy.

1744
01:42:28.610 --> 01:42:33.570
But it has to involve comedy.
Probably Texas.
Really?
Yeah.

1745
01:42:33.720 --> 01:42:36.760
Somewhere.
Did.
My brother lived outside of Dallas and he loved it.
That's great.

1746
01:42:37.090 --> 01:42:40.690
Um,
do you have money?
You could have seven castles.
Oo,
seven.

1747
01:42:40.720 --> 01:42:44.140
I don't want seven too many to look after folks.

1748
01:42:44.141 --> 01:42:48.310
You should see the place where any doing Joe show.
Yeah.

1749
01:42:49.120 --> 01:42:53.470
The Gym outside a nice gym.
Uh,
I like Texas.
I'm a big fan of Texas.

1750
01:42:53.471 --> 01:42:57.370
I would live in Texas.
I think I'd live in Colorado first though.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1751
01:42:57.400 --> 01:43:01.070
We'd not just weed mountains.
You like them?

1752
01:43:01.150 --> 01:43:03.250
I love the way what it does for you.

1753
01:43:03.400 --> 01:43:06.450
There's something about being around mountains said,
uh,
um,

1754
01:43:07.510 --> 01:43:09.040
I was actually reading something about this.

1755
01:43:09.090 --> 01:43:13.720
There's an actual thing that happens to people when you're faced with immense

1756
01:43:13.750 --> 01:43:18.650
natural beauty that it diminishes your ego and yourself and it puts people in,

1757
01:43:18.800 --> 01:43:19.000
you know,

1758
01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:24.000
put you in a hang glider or show perspective being being around mountains.

1759
01:43:24.161 --> 01:43:27.670
It's a humbling.
Sure.
You're around them.
It's as beautiful.

1760
01:43:27.700 --> 01:43:29.530
It's like the best looking art you could ever see.

1761
01:43:29.531 --> 01:43:32.860
He's like a gorgeous mountain with some green hills and the sun coming out of

1762
01:43:32.861 --> 01:43:34.570
the,
it's like,
well that's good.

1763
01:43:34.630 --> 01:43:38.710
Good to look at it as anything that's ever existed.
I'm not very religious.

1764
01:43:38.800 --> 01:43:40.450
I don't know.
I haven't made up my mind,

1765
01:43:40.451 --> 01:43:43.030
but when I see stuff like that is when I get kind of,

1766
01:43:43.630 --> 01:43:46.930
do you want to make it be mine?
I got something right here for you.

1767
01:43:47.200 --> 01:43:48.920
What does that mushrooms.
Mushrooms.

1768
01:43:50.410 --> 01:43:53.420
I know exactly what before Bro.

1769
01:43:54.380 --> 01:43:58.660
Wake up your mind about Joe.
If I commanded by Tuck days on the,

1770
01:43:58.740 --> 01:44:02.580
did he show before?
Just take a little one like no,
fuck that.

1771
01:44:04.400 --> 01:44:08.070
Nobody's got to get hurt.
Just a little one.
Jamie,
do you do that?

1772
01:44:10.260 --> 01:44:11.850
Just a little one.
I don't want to,

1773
01:44:11.851 --> 01:44:14.520
I don't want to be giggling in the car on the way down.
Throwing up on myself.

1774
01:44:14.580 --> 01:44:17.040
It'll be fine.
What's it though?
What's going to happen?

1775
01:44:17.280 --> 01:44:20.300
I want to get out of here before it takes effect and I was going to get me in a

1776
01:44:20.301 --> 01:44:22.800
fucking some type of scissors.
Law should be legal.

1777
01:44:23.450 --> 01:44:26.380
I suppose it would make people mellow the fuck out,
right?

1778
01:44:26.640 --> 01:44:31.080
Would open that third eye man who would do something really good for people.

1779
01:44:31.500 --> 01:44:32.610
The problem is you forget you take it.

1780
01:44:32.611 --> 01:44:37.230
Sometimes you're like an hour and a half later like why am I so,
oh,
okay.
Yeah.

1781
01:44:37.231 --> 01:44:40.500
I don't want to be that far.
My own head.
That's scary.

1782
01:44:40.860 --> 01:44:45.530
Have you ever done the float tank?
No.
You want to do that?
Why can't I get up?

1783
01:44:45.531 --> 01:44:46.830
Float the fuck the egg.

1784
01:44:47.720 --> 01:44:49.510
I should go down there on the raft like everybody else does.

1785
01:44:52.020 --> 01:44:53.100
Last time I ran into you,

1786
01:44:53.160 --> 01:44:57.000
I am so nervous that you get nervous about me making my show.
Do you understand?

1787
01:44:57.060 --> 01:44:59.250
I think we're going to get you out of here in about 15 minutes.

1788
01:44:59.310 --> 01:45:02.520
That's what I think.
Is that all right?
Yeah.
I think that's the right move.

1789
01:45:02.550 --> 01:45:06.170
Maybe 10 you guys got to be really fucking nervous.
I wish I was,

1790
01:45:06.171 --> 01:45:07.260
but at least you have ways,

1791
01:45:07.261 --> 01:45:10.350
ways to put you on some weird fucking flunky back country routes.

1792
01:45:10.390 --> 01:45:14.550
It'll cut 20 minutes out of it and end up in Mexico.
You'll be fine.

1793
01:45:15.140 --> 01:45:16.890
Very close to Mexico,
but super conservative.

1794
01:45:16.891 --> 01:45:19.830
That's what's interesting about San Diego.
I used to,
I don't want my first album.

1795
01:45:19.831 --> 01:45:23.440
I didn't.
La Jolla military.
Yes.
It's all minutes early on there.
Yeah.

1796
01:45:23.490 --> 01:45:25.160
Safe as fuck.
Yeah.

1797
01:45:28.470 --> 01:45:30.210
Maybe I'll have one of those guys at my show tonight.

1798
01:45:30.250 --> 01:45:32.110
The people have said to me like,
where?
Where would you live?

1799
01:45:32.130 --> 01:45:36.150
Would you live in a military town?
Like,
yes.
That's what show used to live.

1800
01:45:36.300 --> 01:45:40.380
You got to have gyms for sure.
He definitely gonna have a gun ranges.

1801
01:45:40.410 --> 01:45:41.131
When you say that,

1802
01:45:41.131 --> 01:45:45.000
does that when they throw you into the alt right adjacent category?
Um,

1803
01:45:45.840 --> 01:45:50.780
probably,
yeah.
I mean the American flag behind me probably contributes to that.

1804
01:45:50.790 --> 01:45:55.590
Oh my God.
How horrible.
I know you're fucking extremist job.
The constitution,

1805
01:45:55.710 --> 01:45:57.480
decolonizing.
That's one of my favorite things.

1806
01:45:57.481 --> 01:46:00.450
Decolonizing or you've been paying attention to that expression.

1807
01:46:00.780 --> 01:46:04.440
People want to decolonize certain,
certain things.
Like what?
Oh look,

1808
01:46:04.441 --> 01:46:08.760
hairstyles and shit.
Tee colonize a Hashtag.
You're not yet.

1809
01:46:08.820 --> 01:46:12.450
There was a guy who got kicked off of a show these similarities talking to rent

1810
01:46:12.460 --> 01:46:17.040
it out.
No,
there's a guy who got kicked off of a show.
He was,
um,

1811
01:46:17.460 --> 01:46:21.180
he was on a show,
a,
I think it was in Montreal,
and he had a,

1812
01:46:21.210 --> 01:46:26.130
he had dreadlocks on and it was this,
he's apparently gender fluid,

1813
01:46:26.730 --> 01:46:29.790
which I guess I dabbled in that.
Yeah,
you can go back and forth.

1814
01:46:29.820 --> 01:46:30.810
She can beat a man and a woman.

1815
01:46:30.811 --> 01:46:33.000
But he does have dreadlocks and they kicked him off the show because he's a

1816
01:46:33.001 --> 01:46:37.130
white guy with dreadlocks and he defended their position.
Uh,

1817
01:46:37.200 --> 01:46:42.200
and one of the phrases they use was about decolonizing specific a hairstyles and

1818
01:46:43.771 --> 01:46:48.580
taking them away from white people and giving them back to the people that,

1819
01:46:49.590 --> 01:46:50.130
oh,
that's sort

1820
01:46:50.130 --> 01:46:54.840
<v 0>of appropriation is what their acute cultural procreation hairstyles.</v>

1821
01:46:54.900 --> 01:46:58.350
I'd like to go a dreads has a 57 year old.
One time you'd be weird.

1822
01:46:58.500 --> 01:46:59.340
It'll be where with treads.

1823
01:46:59.341 --> 01:47:03.360
I get famous just from that then that in a white goatee

1824
01:47:04.890 --> 01:47:07.230
colloquy and says I should wear a black.
He says,

1825
01:47:07.231 --> 01:47:10.920
I'm going to Turtle Agri Steve Jobs in a black turtleneck with yellow lightning

1826
01:47:10.921 --> 01:47:13.110
bolts and call myself dawn Corrado.

1827
01:47:15.450 --> 01:47:20.250
Why?
Why does he just be in funny?
I heard he has an amazing new show.

1828
01:47:20.430 --> 01:47:24.930
That guy his shit.
Watch him work it out,
man.
It's a,
it's all about politics.

1829
01:47:24.931 --> 01:47:27.290
It's about what we were talking to him about.
Red versus bled.

1830
01:47:27.291 --> 01:47:31.650
So timely and shit and you know,
um,
he's a,

1831
01:47:31.651 --> 01:47:34.830
he's a craftsman.
I watch him.
I had a fat black pussy cat.

1832
01:47:34.831 --> 01:47:38.840
I'd go on sometimes I have a show up to his,
what is the fat black pussy gets?

1833
01:47:39.010 --> 01:47:42.030
You'd fucking love it.
Just right around the corner from the comedy cellar.

1834
01:47:42.900 --> 01:47:46.920
He's got a real Bohemian failed to it.
People sitting in couches,
there's lamps.

1835
01:47:46.921 --> 01:47:51.690
It holds about 75 people call was of course quick enough and smart enough to say

1836
01:47:51.691 --> 01:47:56.100
I'm using this every night to work shit out.
And people know you can say like,

1837
01:47:56.101 --> 01:47:59.730
I'm only charging you $5 because I'm going to be working in new stuff out.

1838
01:48:00.360 --> 01:48:05.310
But you would love it.
I just kind of Bohemian feel to it and um,
it's,

1839
01:48:05.430 --> 01:48:09.270
and they give you the door.
Not that that effect has anything to do with you,

1840
01:48:09.480 --> 01:48:14.250
but um,
but it's great.
It's a,
it's a,
you know,
you do an hour of yarn.

1841
01:48:14.340 --> 01:48:18.930
I smoke.
Wow time.
Um,
it's so fun.
It's so,

1842
01:48:20.270 --> 01:48:23.230
uh,
again it's like 75 seats has a little activity to do,
to help.

1843
01:48:23.240 --> 01:48:26.730
That was very attractive.
So New York has some weird little clubs.
Man.

1844
01:48:26.760 --> 01:48:30.380
It's really interesting how New York has it because guys are just hopping around

1845
01:48:30.390 --> 01:48:32.640
like that.
I never,
when I lived in New York,

1846
01:48:32.641 --> 01:48:34.410
I could never afford to live in the city.

1847
01:48:35.220 --> 01:48:38.940
So I lived in new Rochelle and when I did gigs,
I was like,
well,

1848
01:48:38.941 --> 01:48:43.350
I could work in town and do 10 minutes or 15 minutes or I could just go on the

1849
01:48:43.351 --> 01:48:47.490
road and do a Gig in Connecticut or do a Gig and Jersey and make actual money.

1850
01:48:47.491 --> 01:48:48.510
And so I always did that.

1851
01:48:48.600 --> 01:48:52.320
So even when I lived in New York or hardly ever worked in New York,
yeah,

1852
01:48:52.321 --> 01:48:54.810
I don't as much anymore.
I used to,
you know,

1853
01:48:54.811 --> 01:48:56.430
I used to go to the comedy cellar every night,

1854
01:48:56.431 --> 01:48:59.880
but Louis made that place world famous and it's not,

1855
01:48:59.920 --> 01:49:03.540
it used to be a room where you could work shit out,
take your time.
But now it's,

1856
01:49:03.541 --> 01:49:08.150
you know,
it's a fucking tourist.
It's packed.
It's still a great club.
And I,

1857
01:49:08.210 --> 01:49:10.800
but I feel like yell grow that I don't want to do.

1858
01:49:10.980 --> 01:49:14.550
I don't want to go on stage unless I'm doing at least 40 minutes,

1859
01:49:15.270 --> 01:49:18.620
you know what I mean?
I got to get something done.
Uh,
if 15 minutes sets don't,

1860
01:49:18.630 --> 01:49:23.040
that's why I still the fat black pussy get,
which is such a great thing.
Um,

1861
01:49:23.460 --> 01:49:28.130
so look at that.
Nice.
Yeah,
that's it.
Nice.

1862
01:49:29.220 --> 01:49:33.450
That looks big.
And I would always looks bigger from a picture.
It's tiny.

1863
01:49:33.900 --> 01:49:37.110
That's what like from a bed that's from the balcony up there,
which is like the,

1864
01:49:37.111 --> 01:49:41.430
uh,
the belly room with the store.
It's small.
Smaller than that.
Really?
Oh yeah.

1865
01:49:41.500 --> 01:49:46.350
Wastewater that he's smaller than that.
The stores,
70 people upstairs.

1866
01:49:46.590 --> 01:49:47.650
So it's the same

1867
01:49:48.220 --> 01:49:52.940
<v 3>all the way.
The one way a belly.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Little,
not the original.
Original.
Yeah,</v>

1868
01:49:52.990 --> 01:49:56.590
I would say like that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It,
it,
it's,
you'd fucking love it.

1869
01:49:56.591 --> 01:50:00.360
And people sitting in couches and shit.
Wow.
It's,
it's really cool.
And,

1870
01:50:00.361 --> 01:50:04.570
and Noam who runs the,
he couldn't be nicer,
you know,
and uh,

1871
01:50:05.050 --> 01:50:08.230
that's the only one I really do in the city.
Really.
Yeah.
I'm like,
you,

1872
01:50:08.231 --> 01:50:09.610
I'd rather go to governor's or,

1873
01:50:09.611 --> 01:50:13.730
or somewhere else and do some real time governance.
A great club.
Yeah.

1874
01:50:14.050 --> 01:50:16.390
The other thing about,
um,
doing,
um,

1875
01:50:16.420 --> 01:50:19.630
like clubs where there's a lot of people on where you only do in 15 minutes.

1876
01:50:19.840 --> 01:50:21.760
The good thing about it is that it's not your crowd,

1877
01:50:22.240 --> 01:50:24.940
so you have to make people laugh.
They're there just to see comedy.

1878
01:50:24.941 --> 01:50:27.330
They're not just see nick DiPaolo.
Right.
Like if you go to,

1879
01:50:27.730 --> 01:50:29.470
you know how that happens to some guys,

1880
01:50:29.471 --> 01:50:33.160
they develop their crowd and then they kind of lose their edge.
Yes.

1881
01:50:33.190 --> 01:50:37.960
Fucking it's scary,
right?
Yes.
Yes.
Last time I saw you onstage,

1882
01:50:38.020 --> 01:50:40.750
I walked into Caroline's,
uh,
I was just,

1883
01:50:40.810 --> 01:50:43.090
I was just in town for something and you were on stage.

1884
01:50:43.091 --> 01:50:46.870
It was a late show and you were doing some fucking show about Katrina,

1885
01:50:47.230 --> 01:50:51.490
a joke about Katrina that they spelled help wrong on the roof where they were.

1886
01:50:51.520 --> 01:50:53.440
Yeah.
How many people die because they couldn't spell help.

1887
01:50:54.380 --> 01:50:57.070
Can I look into it from a helicopter?
It says,
yeah.
I said,

1888
01:50:57.071 --> 01:50:58.870
if you want have just stepped in that water,
you're standing.

1889
01:51:00.840 --> 01:51:01.280
<v 4>No,</v>

1890
01:51:01.280 --> 01:51:03.230
<v 3>I was fucking crying laughing.
I'm like,</v>

1891
01:51:03.231 --> 01:51:07.640
nick is just still swinging from the head.
That's my way.
That's my favorite joke.

1892
01:51:07.670 --> 01:51:11.490
That that stage is still one of my favorites in the contra.

1893
01:51:11.491 --> 01:51:14.400
I don't do Caroline's and own the problem with Caroline's those when they

1894
01:51:14.401 --> 01:51:17.210
reduced the stage down to the size of a fucking shoe box.

1895
01:51:17.390 --> 01:51:21.980
But you're absolutely adjustable.
Yeah.
But on,
but not like on a Tuesday,

1896
01:51:21.981 --> 01:51:26.240
Wednesday night with like 60 70 people in there.
It's amazing.
It is my faith.

1897
01:51:26.270 --> 01:51:29.180
I was so comfortable cause I played it so much when I first moved to New York.

1898
01:51:29.480 --> 01:51:32.420
I could stay up there for three hours.
I got so much done.

1899
01:51:32.600 --> 01:51:36.470
I wrote half specials on that stage by doing like Tuesday nights for a year.

1900
01:51:36.560 --> 01:51:40.100
Oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
But this is where you get it done.
Yeah.
Right.
Yeah.

1901
01:51:40.260 --> 01:51:43.700
You were right.
Like 60 60 people in the crowd.
Fucking around.

1902
01:51:43.730 --> 01:51:46.910
Isn't that knocked the fuck them.
I did some little place up in Canada,

1903
01:51:46.911 --> 01:51:50.960
Niagara Falls,
the Quanta comedy club.
I'm going to real hole in the wall.

1904
01:51:51.230 --> 01:51:55.700
Shitty tables and you know,
fucking just cheesy had the best time on my lunch.

1905
01:51:55.990 --> 01:52:00.990
Well when a place is big then it becomes a show and you have to do your ad.

1906
01:52:01.550 --> 01:52:06.110
Yeah.
Yeah.
You have to work tight,
which stifles creativity.

1907
01:52:06.200 --> 01:52:10.010
Yeah.
That's one of the reasons why Ari,
when he does a store,

1908
01:52:10.011 --> 01:52:14.060
he'll sign up for like late night and he'll get on like a 1245 or some shit like

1909
01:52:14.061 --> 01:52:15.650
that.
And there's 20 people there.

1910
01:52:16.040 --> 01:52:19.640
And I always say that that's like truth serum because if you do your act in

1911
01:52:19.641 --> 01:52:24.230
front of 20 people,
you know what sucks?
Like there's no,
no confusing.
What sucks.

1912
01:52:24.290 --> 01:52:26.450
It's right in front of.
That's right.
That's right.

1913
01:52:26.570 --> 01:52:28.300
You feel the terribleness of it.
Yeah.

1914
01:52:29.130 --> 01:52:29.963
<v 4>Material.</v>

1915
01:52:31.250 --> 01:52:33.470
<v 3>You don't need 250 people tell you suck.</v>

1916
01:52:33.710 --> 01:52:37.910
It takes four couples and paying attention and you just,
but you feel it.

1917
01:52:37.940 --> 01:52:40.900
Like you can kind of song and dance your way through a couple of hundred feet.

1918
01:52:40.940 --> 01:52:44.990
That's right.
Because even,
yeah,
you're exactly right.
A barometer always said,

1919
01:52:45.200 --> 01:52:46.070
give me just double

1920
01:52:46.070 --> 01:52:50.000
<v 0>figures.
Give me 15 to 20 yes.
That is enough.
Right.</v>

1921
01:52:50.030 --> 01:52:52.530
Great to work out material.
Of course,
it's great to,

1922
01:52:52.531 --> 01:52:55.570
it was to cut out all the Horse Shit in your act,
you know?
Yeah.

1923
01:52:55.580 --> 01:52:58.700
Because if there's only 15 people in the room and seven of them don't like the

1924
01:52:58.701 --> 01:53:01.110
joke,
oh,
you fail it.
Yeah.

1925
01:53:01.210 --> 01:53:05.300
Was the 15 if someone's sitting there with the cross arms staring you down like

1926
01:53:05.330 --> 01:53:09.500
yikes.
That's where the work gets done.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I hate,

1927
01:53:09.501 --> 01:53:12.740
I used to hate playing Caroline's,
and this is ironic,
but this was when I was,

1928
01:53:12.741 --> 01:53:16.130
you know,
had comedy central specials and I was kind of hot and I would sell out

1929
01:53:16.170 --> 01:53:18.290
Caroline's,
I would hate it though,

1930
01:53:18.320 --> 01:53:20.930
like two shows on a Saturday night cause it's packed.

1931
01:53:21.140 --> 01:53:25.100
And I know I have something called the Asshole quotient for every 20 people in

1932
01:53:25.101 --> 01:53:29.540
the club is one asshole.
So if there was like 250,
you know,
somebody do the math.

1933
01:53:29.570 --> 01:53:31.390
So you got more asshole.
Yeah,
I,
oh,

1934
01:53:32.630 --> 01:53:37.070
so you have to work fast and tight to keep their attention as opposed to taking

1935
01:53:37.071 --> 01:53:39.500
your time on a Tuesday night in front of 60 people.

1936
01:53:39.590 --> 01:53:44.030
And the rail funny comes out when you say shit in between you approving bits.

1937
01:53:44.031 --> 01:53:47.120
Yes.
There's the gold.
Yeah.
Right.
Yeah.
It comes out of nowhere.

1938
01:53:47.121 --> 01:53:48.860
It's like it opens up and when you,

1939
01:53:48.861 --> 01:53:53.130
and you put yourself in that frame of mind to when there's only 30 people,
uh,

1940
01:53:53.210 --> 01:53:54.710
you know,
midnight or something like that,

1941
01:53:54.980 --> 01:53:58.240
you're putting yourself in a different framework.
There's no pressure.
Well,

1942
01:53:58.250 --> 01:54:00.260
what kitten?
Now let me ask you that.
[inaudible] say,

1943
01:54:00.920 --> 01:54:05.690
can you do that in front of a full room?
I can't put myself in that mentality.

1944
01:54:05.691 --> 01:54:08.120
It's hard because you have to work differently.

1945
01:54:08.120 --> 01:54:10.010
I feel like I'm being a pussy and given in,

1946
01:54:10.190 --> 01:54:13.280
but I know damn well if I work as slow as I do in front of 40,

1947
01:54:13.281 --> 01:54:17.870
50 people in front of two 50 or 300,
somebody's going to get anxious in the yard.

1948
01:54:17.871 --> 01:54:19.820
At least that's my eye.

1949
01:54:19.910 --> 01:54:22.430
That mentality you said when you show them it's 50 people,

1950
01:54:22.790 --> 01:54:25.570
it's almost like fucking around somebodies living room.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

1951
01:54:25.670 --> 01:54:29.300
And I want that failing in front of 300 people,
400 feet.
It's always different.

1952
01:54:29.330 --> 01:54:30.920
You know,
we were talking about that last night.

1953
01:54:30.921 --> 01:54:32.330
They'd like when you do a large theater,

1954
01:54:32.331 --> 01:54:33.980
it's so much different than doing a club.

1955
01:54:34.010 --> 01:54:35.930
Even if you do a pack club of 500 people,

1956
01:54:35.931 --> 01:54:39.410
then you move to a place that's got 5,000 people.
It's just a different feeling.

1957
01:54:39.620 --> 01:54:43.070
It's a totally different feeling.
You have to do the air quotes act,

1958
01:54:43.460 --> 01:54:48.080
you got to do your act,
you know?
Yeah.
It just gets weird.

1959
01:54:48.110 --> 01:54:52.220
Large numbers are weird that,
yeah,
timing's different.
You have to,

1960
01:54:52.221 --> 01:54:55.550
you can't hammer the punch lines like you can in a club,
like a club,

1961
01:54:55.551 --> 01:54:57.290
you go punch.
You remember Gavin would hit him,

1962
01:54:57.300 --> 01:54:59.810
punched him enough to punch on the tag,
tag,
tag,
tag,
tag.

1963
01:55:00.020 --> 01:55:02.690
And those tags would just have everybody roll.
Yeah.

1964
01:55:03.110 --> 01:55:08.110
Well if he was doing 10,000 people that those tags would get drowned out in the

1965
01:55:08.241 --> 01:55:10.040
laps of love of all the people around you.

1966
01:55:10.070 --> 01:55:12.620
I tried tag and when I did like my first tonight show,

1967
01:55:12.860 --> 01:55:15.950
I tried tag and you know,
and like,

1968
01:55:17.630 --> 01:55:20.480
like I said,
got lost there.
Then for a bank,
it's bourbon.

1969
01:55:22.750 --> 01:55:24.440
You don't tag like you're in a club.
You know,

1970
01:55:24.610 --> 01:55:28.690
I remember learning that lesson maybe,
but you're absolutely right.
Uh,
uh,

1971
01:55:28.960 --> 01:55:32.870
Gavin was rapid fire and I remember watching him at Nick's,

1972
01:55:32.900 --> 01:55:36.770
I came in when I first started coming and I stepped in the door.

1973
01:55:36.771 --> 01:55:40.450
He's on stage and I'm like,
is he dying?
Everybody?
All the,

1974
01:55:40.460 --> 01:55:42.080
everybody was doubled over in the audience.

1975
01:55:42.170 --> 01:55:44.220
I thought he was fucking done all sudden.
You know,

1976
01:55:44.730 --> 01:55:47.400
you couldn't hear any laughed at all sudden a huge draw.
I mean,

1977
01:55:47.401 --> 01:55:48.630
cause he would tag,
like you said,

1978
01:55:48.690 --> 01:55:51.840
take a joke 11 times and people are still dying from the law.

1979
01:55:51.990 --> 01:55:54.260
They were literally bent over,
nothing was coming out of it.
I'm like,
yeah,

1980
01:55:54.630 --> 01:55:57.050
I mean he was shaking the roundedness.
Yeah,

1981
01:55:57.810 --> 01:56:00.720
I think we got a chance to see some guys that are probably some of the best

1982
01:56:00.721 --> 01:56:03.420
comics of all time and people don't know.
You know,

1983
01:56:03.421 --> 01:56:06.360
I think with chewing Sweeney and Gavin and Lenny and,
and,

1984
01:56:06.430 --> 01:56:09.870
and those guys that we saw when they were in their prime and had a rod,

1985
01:56:09.871 --> 01:56:12.150
you're sure.
Yeah.
Kenny,
when we were coming up,

1986
01:56:12.180 --> 01:56:16.230
those guys were in their prime and when we were young,
we've got a chance to see,

1987
01:56:16.231 --> 01:56:19.740
I think some of the greatest of all time,
no doubt about it.
But they got stuck.

1988
01:56:20.460 --> 01:56:23.500
Well the guys at next put them on a contract for a while to remember,

1989
01:56:23.520 --> 01:56:28.070
gave them good money and coke.
Yeah.
They,
they will make,

1990
01:56:28.071 --> 01:56:31.860
and I remember him telling me they would make three grand a weekend and not

1991
01:56:31.861 --> 01:56:36.410
having to leave your city making road money and,
and like you said,

1992
01:56:36.411 --> 01:56:40.570
a lot of some parks on the side.
Um,
free booze from all that.
Yeah.

1993
01:56:40.640 --> 01:56:45.360
All the but it all live great.
Did they ever,
but uh,
yeah and in the long run,

1994
01:56:45.361 --> 01:56:46.210
you know,
um,

1995
01:56:46.650 --> 01:56:50.160
well in the long run it was a problem but we got to see some crazy fucking car.

1996
01:56:50.160 --> 01:56:50.621
I remember those,

1997
01:56:50.621 --> 01:56:53.010
some of those nights and Nick's comedy stop when you watch those guys get,

1998
01:56:53.011 --> 01:56:56.310
I won't remember.
Sweeney killing so hard.

1999
01:56:56.610 --> 01:57:00.000
You almost wanted to quit comment enough.
There's no way I could do that.
Well,

2000
01:57:00.001 --> 01:57:03.480
I have to follow the fucking guy.
Gavin would in Boston back then.

2001
01:57:03.860 --> 01:57:07.550
If you know Don Galvin show,
he would be the host swimming.

2002
01:57:07.790 --> 01:57:10.530
No Gaddafi the halls.
He would start off the show.
Yeah.

2003
01:57:10.710 --> 01:57:13.170
That's a different thing about Boston too,
right?
That's right.

2004
01:57:13.200 --> 01:57:15.600
Like if you did the Nick Depaulo show at Nick's comedy stop,

2005
01:57:15.630 --> 01:57:19.320
you would just be hard off the shot.
And what was crazy?
It was great,

2006
01:57:19.321 --> 01:57:23.190
but young comic,
but I had to follow cabin.
You want a tight 15.

2007
01:57:23.850 --> 01:57:28.050
So it made me,
you know,
fucking uh,
it may,

2008
01:57:28.080 --> 01:57:32.430
you had to be able to hold your own and they talk at a hundred miles an hour

2009
01:57:32.431 --> 01:57:35.430
plus they coked up and they're really,
and they're really funny.

2010
01:57:35.520 --> 01:57:36.301
They're really funny.

2011
01:57:36.301 --> 01:57:40.470
And they get heavy Boston accents and their big men that like big imposing

2012
01:57:40.471 --> 01:57:43.500
people.
Oh yeah.
And they would destroy some guy who came in.

2013
01:57:43.501 --> 01:57:46.260
