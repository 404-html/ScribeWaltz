00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:05.311
<v Speaker 1>Hi everybody,</v>

2
00:00:05.311 --> 00:00:06.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm here with Nick Nixon.</v>

3
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.340
<v Speaker 1>Just did the podcast for the first time.</v>

4
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.210
<v Speaker 1>It was incredible.</v>

5
00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.110
<v Speaker 1>It was amazing.</v>

6
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.720
<v Speaker 1>Now the drive back is going to be not that bad.</v>

7
00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:13.500
<v Speaker 1>It won't be bad now.</v>

8
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:13.800
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

9
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:14.311
<v Speaker 1>it's perfect.</v>

10
00:00:14.311 --> 00:00:16.760
<v Speaker 1>There's no traffic right now going well,</v>

11
00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:17.431
<v Speaker 1>it might be a little.</v>

12
00:00:17.431 --> 00:00:18.360
<v Speaker 1>It's actually 6:00.</v>

13
00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:18.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

14
00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:19.860
<v Speaker 1>it's actually rush hour,</v>

15
00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.450
<v Speaker 1>but usually people are going the opposite direction and I go,</v>

16
00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.160
<v Speaker 1>well actually they're kind of going everywhere right now,</v>

17
00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:28.310
<v Speaker 1>tonight before holidays.</v>

18
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.380
<v Speaker 1>So people done son,</v>

19
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.260
<v Speaker 1>Echo Park.</v>

20
00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.070
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

21
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.510
<v Speaker 1>I can give you better directions.</v>

22
00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:37.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

23
00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.530
<v Speaker 1>there is a way to avoid a lot of shit.</v>

24
00:00:38.531 --> 00:00:39.810
<v Speaker 1>That's what I thought it was going to get.</v>

25
00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.380
<v Speaker 1>A sneaky little way that you can avoid to leave here.</v>

26
00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.150
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to move even further away from here.</v>

27
00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:48.300
<v Speaker 1>I've looked at and I liked it.</v>

28
00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.250
<v Speaker 1>I looked at some places.</v>

29
00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.760
<v Speaker 1>I want to move them.</v>

30
00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.070
<v Speaker 1>I want to get a house in the mountains.</v>

31
00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:53.940
<v Speaker 1>I would love to.</v>

32
00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.500
<v Speaker 1>I want to get a house in Lake Arrowhead,</v>

33
00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.580
<v Speaker 1>hour out or whatever.</v>

34
00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:00.620
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm talking about.</v>

35
00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:02.670
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing up there.</v>

36
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:03.713
<v Speaker 1>So Sam,</v>

37
00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:08.990
<v Speaker 1>we can relax and bring benches and there's weird she bought them to deliver</v>

38
00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:10.283
<v Speaker 1>around that.</v>

39
00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.330
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of interesting cats up there and so anywhere you live in the</v>

40
00:01:13.331 --> 00:01:13.830
<v Speaker 1>mountains,</v>

41
00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:14.491
<v Speaker 1>you live in the mountains,</v>

42
00:01:14.491 --> 00:01:16.200
<v Speaker 1>living with people that are living around nature.</v>

43
00:01:16.201 --> 00:01:19.680
<v Speaker 1>You got to live around interesting people and for sure they got strong,</v>

44
00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.193
<v Speaker 1>strong,</v>

45
00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:23.270
<v Speaker 1>strong mountains.</v>

46
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.970
<v Speaker 1>We have that here though too.</v>

47
00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.650
<v Speaker 1>We definitely have a lack of strong strongly.</v>

48
00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:31.561
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

49
00:01:31.561 --> 00:01:32.850
<v Speaker 1>sometimes the wait is too strong,</v>

50
00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:33.241
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

51
00:01:33.241 --> 00:01:34.290
<v Speaker 1>I forgot what we were.</v>

52
00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:35.030
<v Speaker 1>Um.</v>

53
00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.850
<v Speaker 1>Oh Canada,</v>

54
00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:36.070
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

55
00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:36.570
<v Speaker 1>England,</v>

56
00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:36.961
<v Speaker 1>England.</v>

57
00:01:36.961 --> 00:01:38.550
<v Speaker 1>We had some weed in England and I was like,</v>

58
00:01:38.551 --> 00:01:39.540
<v Speaker 1>this is really good weed.</v>

59
00:01:39.541 --> 00:01:40.650
<v Speaker 1>It's not too strong.</v>

60
00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.770
<v Speaker 1>It's like I don't feel like I want roller kit.</v>

61
00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.490
<v Speaker 1>Like Roller Skates Hash.</v>

62
00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:46.310
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

63
00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:47.330
<v Speaker 1>it was weed,</v>

64
00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:48.060
<v Speaker 1>but it was like,</v>

65
00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.160
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't like,</v>

66
00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

67
00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.000
<v Speaker 1>some California where it is so hard.</v>

68
00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.021
<v Speaker 1>It's so stony.</v>

69
00:01:52.021 --> 00:01:54.240
<v Speaker 1>It's so powerful that you kind of just like,</v>

70
00:01:54.241 --> 00:01:55.350
<v Speaker 1>you get hit with any like,</v>

71
00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:55.801
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

72
00:01:55.801 --> 00:01:57.030
<v Speaker 1>I gotta manage this.</v>

73
00:01:57.031 --> 00:01:59.710
<v Speaker 1>You know your mind in terms of job.</v>

74
00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:00.031
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

75
00:02:00.031 --> 00:02:00.864
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

76
00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.060
<v Speaker 1>but whereas with this weed it was silly.</v>

77
00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:03.740
<v Speaker 1>We'd was like,</v>

78
00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:04.441
<v Speaker 1>you hit it,</v>

79
00:02:04.441 --> 00:02:05.111
<v Speaker 1>you felt high,</v>

80
00:02:05.111 --> 00:02:05.761
<v Speaker 1>you felt good,</v>

81
00:02:05.761 --> 00:02:10.170
<v Speaker 1>but you didn't feel too fucked up and it took like four hits not to like two</v>

82
00:02:10.171 --> 00:02:11.004
<v Speaker 1>minutes of California.</v>

83
00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:14.160
<v Speaker 1>Are you adjusting to a different atmosphere?</v>

84
00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

85
00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:16.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

86
00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.570
<v Speaker 1>And you want to talk about.</v>

87
00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.040
<v Speaker 1>I think Seattle's depressing.</v>

88
00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.991
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

89
00:02:21.991 --> 00:02:22.411
<v Speaker 1>I've never.</v>

90
00:02:22.411 --> 00:02:23.820
<v Speaker 1>I've only spent a night in England,</v>

91
00:02:23.821 --> 00:02:24.654
<v Speaker 1>a mentor.</v>

92
00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:25.543
<v Speaker 1>Did you do stand up there?</v>

93
00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.173
<v Speaker 1>People are great.</v>

94
00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.691
<v Speaker 1>The grant,</v>

95
00:02:27.691 --> 00:02:28.740
<v Speaker 1>we did a UFC there too.</v>

96
00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.830
<v Speaker 1>The people are really nice people.</v>

97
00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.060
<v Speaker 1>Some of the most polite people.</v>

98
00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:33.420
<v Speaker 1>I really smart as well,</v>

99
00:02:33.421 --> 00:02:34.141
<v Speaker 1>but man,</v>

100
00:02:34.141 --> 00:02:37.360
<v Speaker 1>the weather is oppressing whether it seems like that fall,</v>

101
00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.630
<v Speaker 1>foggy and raining every day and</v>

102
00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.911
<v Speaker 1>that too.</v>

103
00:02:41.911 --> 00:02:42.744
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

104
00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:43.261
<v Speaker 1>they don't have that.</v>

105
00:02:43.261 --> 00:02:44.850
<v Speaker 1>American dental son.</v>

106
00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:46.343
<v Speaker 1>Wga,</v>

107
00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:47.250
<v Speaker 1>their dental bills.</v>

108
00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:48.180
<v Speaker 1>Nick,</v>

109
00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.110
<v Speaker 1>you're a road warrior.</v>

110
00:02:49.111 --> 00:02:50.940
<v Speaker 1>How many days a year do you travel?</v>

111
00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.840
<v Speaker 1>A.</v>

112
00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.160
<v Speaker 1>I'd probably only on the road,</v>

113
00:02:53.161 --> 00:02:54.210
<v Speaker 1>like maybe half the year.</v>

114
00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.450
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>

115
00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:54.960
<v Speaker 1>Really important.</v>

116
00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:55.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

117
00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.770
<v Speaker 1>because I go off and on because I write in town to get writing and you stay in</v>

118
00:02:59.771 --> 00:03:02.480
<v Speaker 1>town and then he just started doing stand up on the felon.</v>

119
00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.771
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

120
00:03:02.771 --> 00:03:03.604
<v Speaker 1>fill in time.</v>

121
00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:04.660
<v Speaker 1>Shizam bitches.</v>

122
00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:05.321
<v Speaker 1>They heard it.</v>

123
00:03:05.321 --> 00:03:09.310
<v Speaker 1>That's how he runs his life and you could find nick on twitter.</v>

124
00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.890
<v Speaker 1>It's nic k a t h e.</v>

125
00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:13.350
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly how.</v>

126
00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:15.100
<v Speaker 1>Find funding and I'm verified.</v>

127
00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.501
<v Speaker 1>So you,</v>

128
00:03:15.501 --> 00:03:15.961
<v Speaker 1>that's how you know.</v>

129
00:03:15.961 --> 00:03:16.900
<v Speaker 1>It's really mean.</v>

130
00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.940
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine we're making video powerful.</v>

131
00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.980
<v Speaker 1>Hold on us or was a today Donald Trump,</v>

132
00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:29.680
<v Speaker 1>another hilarious podcast.</v>

133
00:03:29.681 --> 00:03:30.514
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

134
00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:32.431
<v Speaker 1>we haven't done that.</v>

135
00:03:32.431 --> 00:03:33.670
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise we're dead.</v>

136
00:03:33.671 --> 00:03:35.320
<v Speaker 1>We need to do it like once a month.</v>

137
00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.400
<v Speaker 1>I'd love to keep to keep figuring out a way to avoid this.</v>

138
00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:40.420
<v Speaker 1>This is what we have to do.</v>

139
00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:45.420
<v Speaker 1>We have to do a steady one of these because I think one a month is perfect for</v>

140
00:03:45.581 --> 00:03:48.430
<v Speaker 1>us to have a shitload of things that we haven't talked to each other,</v>

141
00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:49.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

142
00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:50.370
<v Speaker 1>because we talked so much about the,</v>

143
00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.650
<v Speaker 1>on the phone about things and we see each other clubs about things that</v>

144
00:03:53.651 --> 00:03:57.430
<v Speaker 1>sometimes a lot of stuff gets like tread to the point where we can't bring it up</v>

145
00:03:57.431 --> 00:04:00.060
<v Speaker 1>organically in front of each other anymore because we already talked about that.</v>

146
00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:03.250
<v Speaker 1>So when you're talking about on the podcast doesn't come out as seamlessly.</v>

147
00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.010
<v Speaker 1>So we have like one month between podcasts.</v>

148
00:04:06.011 --> 00:04:07.540
<v Speaker 1>We built up a lot of good shit.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's good.</v>

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.100
<v Speaker 1>It's been a month since the last one about right.</v>

153
00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:14.260
<v Speaker 1>I've been fucking around with this bit.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I can't tell you.</v>

157
00:04:16.691 --> 00:04:17.524
<v Speaker 1>It's not ready yet.</v>

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:18.790
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you after we're done with this.</v>

159
00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:19.983
<v Speaker 1>You can't know yet.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's doing really well right now,</v>

163
00:04:23.291 --> 00:04:24.124
<v Speaker 1>but needs some work.</v>

164
00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:25.360
<v Speaker 1>I just want to talk to my friend.</v>

165
00:04:25.361 --> 00:04:26.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go to Chicago or you guys.</v>

166
00:04:26.951 --> 00:04:27.390
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

167
00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:28.223
<v Speaker 1>I</v>

168
00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:34.360
<v Speaker 1>go to the Chicago theater and it will be lots of foreign firm.</v>

169
00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:35.830
<v Speaker 1>We are bringing a party.</v>

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:40.980
<v Speaker 1>We're bringing Joey Diaz and Dunkin and you know what it is what it is.</v>

171
00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:43.660
<v Speaker 1>It is a big fat fucking comedy party.</v>

172
00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:44.500
<v Speaker 1>That's what it's going to be.</v>

173
00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:45.460
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be a good time.</v>

174
00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:47.830
<v Speaker 1>The Chicago theater is awesome.</v>

175
00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:48.520
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

176
00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.980
<v Speaker 1>we're having the UFC Wayne's there that same night,</v>

177
00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:53.920
<v Speaker 1>so the way it's going to be there at 4:00 and we're going to have a show there</v>

178
00:04:53.921 --> 00:04:54.121

179
00:04:54.121 --> 00:04:54.571

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:55.480
<v Speaker 1>it's awesome.</v>

182
00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:58.360
<v Speaker 1>And it's fun because when I was looking for theaters in Chicago,</v>

183
00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:59.050
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

184
00:04:59.050 --> 00:04:59.590
<v Speaker 1>we uh,</v>

185
00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:02.710
<v Speaker 1>tried to get this theater and they said that someone has a hold on it for that</v>

186
00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:02.711
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

187
00:05:02.711 --> 00:05:02.951
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

188
00:05:02.951 --> 00:05:03.341
<v Speaker 1>well fuck,</v>

189
00:05:03.341 --> 00:05:03.700
<v Speaker 1>let's fine,</v>

190
00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:04.610
<v Speaker 1>let's challenge the whole.</v>

191
00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.400
<v Speaker 1>It's finding a whole lose the UFC fairly.</v>

192
00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:10.480
<v Speaker 1>So I knew the UFC was going to be out of there by 6:00.</v>

193
00:05:10.481 --> 00:05:11.220
<v Speaker 1>They're done.</v>

194
00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:14.500
<v Speaker 1>And then we come in at eight to house bitch.</v>

195
00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:16.360
<v Speaker 1>And I haven't been to Chicago in a long time.</v>

196
00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:16.991
<v Speaker 1>The last time was,</v>

197
00:05:16.991 --> 00:05:18.340
<v Speaker 1>there was actually my 40th birthday.</v>

198
00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:19.233
<v Speaker 1>I've never been.</v>

199
00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:21.470
<v Speaker 1>Remember we had that crazy birthday cake.</v>

200
00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:22.980
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

201
00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:24.400
<v Speaker 1>Great comedy came from Chicago.</v>

202
00:05:24.401 --> 00:05:25.630
<v Speaker 1>Chicago's a great comedy town.</v>

203
00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:26.440
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

204
00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:29.650
<v Speaker 1>It's a comedy town that much like Boston was at one point in time,</v>

205
00:05:29.651 --> 00:05:30.431
<v Speaker 1>a great comments on.</v>

206
00:05:30.431 --> 00:05:31.720
<v Speaker 1>And that was a little bit deprived.</v>

207
00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:31.971
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

208
00:05:31.971 --> 00:05:32.200
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

209
00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:33.460
<v Speaker 1>there's not that much there anymore.</v>

210
00:05:33.461 --> 00:05:36.520
<v Speaker 1>There's a few clubs that have died off or something made comics coming out of</v>

211
00:05:36.521 --> 00:05:37.354
<v Speaker 1>Chicago.</v>

212
00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:37.601
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

213
00:05:37.601 --> 00:05:38.560
<v Speaker 1>when kids start out there,</v>

214
00:05:38.561 --> 00:05:40.830
<v Speaker 1>they try to get out of there and go somewhere with a scene.</v>

215
00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:42.190
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

216
00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:43.930
<v Speaker 1>there's a few scenes left in the country.</v>

217
00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:44.680
<v Speaker 1>Denver is,</v>

218
00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:45.401
<v Speaker 1>in my opinion,</v>

219
00:05:45.401 --> 00:05:46.270
<v Speaker 1>one of the big ones.</v>

220
00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:47.260
<v Speaker 1>Underrated,</v>

221
00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:47.831
<v Speaker 1>underrated,</v>

222
00:05:47.831 --> 00:05:48.581
<v Speaker 1>under appreciated.</v>

223
00:05:48.581 --> 00:05:49.150
<v Speaker 1>Seeing.</v>

224
00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:49.340
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

225
00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:49.661
<v Speaker 1>Denver.</v>

226
00:05:49.661 --> 00:05:50.494
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking great.</v>

227
00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:52.870
<v Speaker 1>You know what else has got a good scene in Atlanta?</v>

228
00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:54.860
<v Speaker 1>That's great.</v>

229
00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:55.290
<v Speaker 1>Can,</v>

230
00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:56.123
<v Speaker 1>it's going to seem.</v>

231
00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:00.720
<v Speaker 1>And the fucking the um.</v>

232
00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:01.111
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

233
00:06:01.111 --> 00:06:01.651
<v Speaker 1>the other place.</v>

234
00:06:01.651 --> 00:06:04.040
<v Speaker 1>So the Jesus Christ,</v>

235
00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:05.220
<v Speaker 1>the place that I was going to.</v>

236
00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:05.520
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

237
00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:06.230
<v Speaker 1>Sarah Club?</v>

238
00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:06.711
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

239
00:06:06.711 --> 00:06:08.250
<v Speaker 1>Only to the punchline.</v>

240
00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:09.160
<v Speaker 1>Punchlines cars.</v>

241
00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:09.993
<v Speaker 1>How can I remember that?</v>

242
00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:10.770
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

243
00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:11.551
<v Speaker 1>So many names.</v>

244
00:06:11.551 --> 00:06:12.210
<v Speaker 1>The chuckle hut,</v>

245
00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:13.170
<v Speaker 1>the fuck factory,</v>

246
00:06:13.171 --> 00:06:14.580
<v Speaker 1>the fucking giggle house.</v>

247
00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:16.770
<v Speaker 1>But the punchline is amazing club.</v>

248
00:06:16.771 --> 00:06:19.920
<v Speaker 1>That place is super old school and it's really a museum.</v>

249
00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:22.620
<v Speaker 1>It's just like the ice house when you walk around and see shit on the wall.</v>

250
00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:23.970
<v Speaker 1>That's called Holy Shit.</v>

251
00:06:23.971 --> 00:06:24.390
<v Speaker 1>This is like,</v>

252
00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:24.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

253
00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:26.310
<v Speaker 1>as a headshot from 1980.</v>

254
00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:27.320
<v Speaker 1>This is the punchline,</v>

255
00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:32.690
<v Speaker 1>the laughing skull man because it's this compact like fucking Bentley Room style</v>

256
00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:34.850
<v Speaker 1>underground club.</v>

257
00:06:34.851 --> 00:06:39.851
<v Speaker 1>And like it's a great thing to see I think like 100 and that sounds like the</v>

258
00:06:40.011 --> 00:06:40.990
<v Speaker 1>perfect place to go to,</v>

259
00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:42.200
<v Speaker 1>to work on new material.</v>

260
00:06:42.201 --> 00:06:42.951
<v Speaker 1>I can love it man.</v>

261
00:06:42.951 --> 00:06:45.710
<v Speaker 1>It's beautiful club events right under this cool bar,</v>

262
00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:46.431
<v Speaker 1>the vortex.</v>

263
00:06:46.431 --> 00:06:47.264
<v Speaker 1>So it's like,</v>

264
00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:48.800
<v Speaker 1>I mean when I go there and man,</v>

265
00:06:48.801 --> 00:06:51.380
<v Speaker 1>it's really bad because it's endless beer and like,</v>

266
00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:51.621
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

267
00:06:51.621 --> 00:06:52.450
<v Speaker 1>let's go together.</v>

268
00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:53.200
<v Speaker 1>I'd love to.</v>

269
00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:53.390
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

270
00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:54.290
<v Speaker 1>that'd be so fun.</v>

271
00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:59.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do that right after I filmed my next special because when I fell my</v>

272
00:06:59.481 --> 00:06:59.931
<v Speaker 1>next special,</v>

273
00:06:59.931 --> 00:07:02.690
<v Speaker 1>the first thing I'm going to do is go on a rampage of small club.</v>

274
00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:04.570
<v Speaker 1>So after that I don't know.</v>

275
00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:07.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm going there and I'm booked again for like the summer,</v>

276
00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:10.400
<v Speaker 1>but we should fucking be so fun to hang out there</v>

277
00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:15.920
<v Speaker 1>window from the time I record specialist at the time I'd actually air still like</v>

278
00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:19.750
<v Speaker 1>you have to come up with a lot of new fucking material so I'm going to want to</v>

279
00:07:19.751 --> 00:07:21.670
<v Speaker 1>go on the road a lot right after it airs.</v>

280
00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:23.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm going on a long before,</v>

281
00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:23.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

282
00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:26.230
<v Speaker 1>because I only have like three or four months to really come up with them on a</v>

283
00:07:26.231 --> 00:07:27.064
<v Speaker 1>new shit.</v>

284
00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:27.481
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

285
00:07:27.481 --> 00:07:28.314
<v Speaker 1>it's tricky,</v>

286
00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:28.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

287
00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:31.720
<v Speaker 1>but those small places like the place we're going to be out this weekend,</v>

288
00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:33.220
<v Speaker 1>the Pasadena Ice House,</v>

289
00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:34.090
<v Speaker 1>we're in the annex,</v>

290
00:07:34.091 --> 00:07:36.190
<v Speaker 1>which is a really awesome room.</v>

291
00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:41.320
<v Speaker 1>It is a really rare opportunity to see comedy in like about as intimate and</v>

<v Speaker 1>I allow a certain amount of leniency.</v>

360
00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:44.460
<v Speaker 1>It was already my middle name.</v>

361
00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:46.230
<v Speaker 1>It's not like you made up a name.</v>

362
00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:47.700
<v Speaker 1>I am sunflower,</v>

363
00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:49.321

366
00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:52.470

00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:53.401
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

368
00:09:53.401 --> 00:09:54.234
<v Speaker 1>You did.</v>

369
00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:55.143
<v Speaker 1>Good point.</v>

370
00:09:55.350 --> 00:10:00.350
<v Speaker 1>I want to show everybody that fucking super sexy fanny pack your rock and that.</v>

371
00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:02.570
<v Speaker 1>His debts,</v>

372
00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:08.040
<v Speaker 1>that Syrup Syrup Fanny packs that sort of makes a hemp gear.</v>

373
00:10:08.041 --> 00:10:12.420
<v Speaker 1>They make a hemp geek that I wear as well and they've decided to make a</v>

374
00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:15.510
<v Speaker 1>fanny pack when it's so big.</v>

375
00:10:15.511 --> 00:10:19.380
<v Speaker 1>It's like a backpack that I use it for a camera bag in one way.</v>

376
00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:20.880
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty fucking killer though.</v>

377
00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:24.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to use it for traveling I think because it's tough,</v>

378
00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:27.840
<v Speaker 1>but hemp is amazing material man.</v>

379
00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:30.750
<v Speaker 1>I mean I really should have made my tee shirts at a half,</v>

380
00:10:30.751 --> 00:10:33.510
<v Speaker 1>but it would have been even more expensive than the ones that I have now.</v>

381
00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:34.590
<v Speaker 1>I like the highest.</v>

382
00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:35.850
<v Speaker 1>The higher primates shirts,</v>

383
00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:37.320
<v Speaker 1>highest quality cotton.</v>

384
00:10:37.321 --> 00:10:39.650
<v Speaker 1>I could get and really thin light ponds,</v>

385
00:10:39.651 --> 00:10:40.800
<v Speaker 1>so it's like real comfortable,</v>

386
00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:41.873
<v Speaker 1>but people were like,</v>

387
00:10:42.770 --> 00:10:43.603
<v Speaker 1>Make Hampshire.</v>

388
00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:48.240
<v Speaker 1>It's probably isn't move because happens a superior form of cloth.</v>

389
00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:49.440
<v Speaker 1>It's just much stronger.</v>

390
00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:49.980
<v Speaker 1>I like him.</v>

391
00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:50.400
<v Speaker 1>Shirts,</v>

392
00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:51.233
<v Speaker 1>tee shirts.</v>

393
00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.880
<v Speaker 1>My Ge mad shrunk like crazy.</v>

394
00:10:53.881 --> 00:10:55.400
<v Speaker 1>That whole shit bamboos.</v>

395
00:10:55.401 --> 00:10:56.240
<v Speaker 1>And another good one too.</v>

396
00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:57.810
<v Speaker 1>It's easy to grow again.</v>

397
00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:00.000
<v Speaker 1>You can get really good bamboo sheets.</v>

398
00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:02.310
<v Speaker 1>Bedsheets using those for a long time.</v>

399
00:11:02.311 --> 00:11:02.551
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>

400
00:11:02.551 --> 00:11:03.210
<v Speaker 1>towels,</v>

401
00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:06.270
<v Speaker 1>rugs naturally antimicrobial as well.</v>

402
00:11:06.271 --> 00:11:08.650
<v Speaker 1>So maybe have bamboo grows fast.</v>

403
00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:09.493
<v Speaker 1>It's fun.</v>

404
00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:11.011
<v Speaker 1>Show about,</v>

405
00:11:11.011 --> 00:11:11.340
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

406
00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:15.990
<v Speaker 1>them taking bamboo and using it to make houses because you chop it up and you</v>

407
00:11:15.991 --> 00:11:16.081
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

408
00:11:16.081 --> 00:11:20.730
<v Speaker 1>use the fibers of and they make a cardboard or plywood and have this bamboo</v>

409
00:11:20.731 --> 00:11:21.450
<v Speaker 1>fiber.</v>

410
00:11:21.450 --> 00:11:23.460
<v Speaker 1>But it grows like nothing.</v>

411
00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:25.310
<v Speaker 1>It's all of you watching.</v>

412
00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:26.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

413
00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:28.380
<v Speaker 1>What a fucking plan.</v>

414
00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:29.750
<v Speaker 1>And they use it for um,</v>

415
00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:30.210
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

416
00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:32.250
<v Speaker 1>occasionally use it for pool cues as well.</v>

417
00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:36.330
<v Speaker 1>Some guys have been doing that recently because the strength of bamboo compare</v>

418
00:11:36.331 --> 00:11:37.490
<v Speaker 1>to the strength of other woods,</v>

419
00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:40.090
<v Speaker 1>like through the roof on that kind of line,</v>

420
00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:45.160
<v Speaker 1>that vertical line apparently in the this splice it and compile it.</v>

421
00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:46.600
<v Speaker 1>And when you make a pool cue here,</v>

422
00:11:46.650 --> 00:11:47.790
<v Speaker 1>but it has like a fucking,</v>

423
00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:49.170
<v Speaker 1>like a crazy hit to.</v>

424
00:11:49.210 --> 00:11:51.020
<v Speaker 1>It felt like extra spring to.</v>

425
00:11:51.070 --> 00:11:53.190
<v Speaker 1>It just totally makes sense.</v>

426
00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:55.210
<v Speaker 1>We're about to do some manly shit right now.</v>

427
00:11:55.211 --> 00:11:55.930
<v Speaker 1>Play Pool.</v>

428
00:11:55.930 --> 00:11:57.580
<v Speaker 1>Brian played pool with me a couple times,</v>

429
00:11:57.581 --> 00:12:00.460
<v Speaker 1>but since then he's learned that have considered it.</v>

430
00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:02.530
<v Speaker 1>I considered poor two totally different things,</v>

431
00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:03.251
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

432
00:12:03.251 --> 00:12:03.550
<v Speaker 1>Brian?</v>

433
00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:04.383
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

434
00:12:04.450 --> 00:12:05.283
<v Speaker 1>What's the difference?</v>

435
00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:06.160
<v Speaker 1>You're addicted.</v>

436
00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:07.243
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

437
00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:08.380
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

438
00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:09.610
<v Speaker 1>you're hardcore about it.</v>

439
00:12:09.611 --> 00:12:13.240
<v Speaker 1>Like you do a hundred games in a night where I'm used to like,</v>

440
00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:13.481
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

441
00:12:13.481 --> 00:12:15.880
<v Speaker 1>we'll just have some beer and play a couple games of pool.</v>

442
00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:16.990
<v Speaker 1>You're now at the bar.</v>

443
00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:17.680
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

444
00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:19.750
<v Speaker 1>let's play 100 games and let's be there for five.</v>

445
00:12:19.751 --> 00:12:20.584
<v Speaker 1>Eight till five minutes.</v>

446
00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:22.600
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't even lock until about game seven,</v>

447
00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:23.860
<v Speaker 1>dash seven.</v>

448
00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:26.590
<v Speaker 1>That's when he gets out and you're in fucking trouble.</v>

449
00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:28.350
<v Speaker 1>I got to steal a few games early.</v>

450
00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:30.580
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise be a bad night.</v>

451
00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:33.210
<v Speaker 1>Although now my hair is my wife.</v>

452
00:12:33.211 --> 00:12:35.040
<v Speaker 1>My wife was a friend that will delete photos.</v>

453
00:12:35.041 --> 00:12:36.180
<v Speaker 1>You can't let her have a camera</v>

454
00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:40.340
<v Speaker 1>in it.</v>

455
00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:40.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

456
00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:43.930
<v Speaker 1>She just deleted all the pictures that don't delete that.</v>

457
00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:46.530
<v Speaker 1>They call you the next day and say,</v>

458
00:12:46.531 --> 00:12:48.720
<v Speaker 1>did you delete facebook?</v>

459
00:12:48.721 --> 00:12:50.880
<v Speaker 1>I used to scour my tags and be like,</v>

460
00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:51.630
<v Speaker 1>don't care,</v>

461
00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:52.021
<v Speaker 1>like whatever.</v>

462
00:12:52.021 --> 00:12:53.580
<v Speaker 1>I want to look ugly 20 percent of the time.</v>

463
00:12:54.050 --> 00:12:54.180
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

464
00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:55.013
<v Speaker 1>that's hilarious.</v>

465
00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:56.101
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

466
00:12:56.101 --> 00:12:57.030
<v Speaker 1>Eighty percent average.</v>

467
00:12:57.960 --> 00:12:59.340
<v Speaker 1>Can't worry about what you look like,</v>

468
00:12:59.341 --> 00:13:00.060
<v Speaker 1>your photos.</v>

469
00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:01.620
<v Speaker 1>Don't worry about what you actually look like.</v>

470
00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:02.730
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

471
00:13:02.730 --> 00:13:03.563
<v Speaker 1>write him.</v>

472
00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:07.420
<v Speaker 1>If you look good in real life and they got a picture of you like bronchitis guys</v>

473
00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:07.770
<v Speaker 1>don't care.</v>

474
00:13:07.770 --> 00:13:08.161
<v Speaker 1>Like Brian,</v>

475
00:13:08.161 --> 00:13:09.480
<v Speaker 1>there's a million pictures of you.</v>

476
00:13:10.530 --> 00:13:13.130
<v Speaker 1>How many photos of you or they give us the faith.</v>

477
00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:16.650
<v Speaker 1>Literally thousands of pictures that still going on now.</v>

478
00:13:16.651 --> 00:13:17.450
<v Speaker 1>I stopped it,</v>

479
00:13:17.450 --> 00:13:20.790
<v Speaker 1>stopped doing it too much and then I just found myself always doing it.</v>

480
00:13:20.791 --> 00:13:21.624
<v Speaker 1>When I was around Joseph,</v>

481
00:13:21.930 --> 00:13:22.380
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

482
00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:22.621
<v Speaker 1>all right.</v>

483
00:13:22.621 --> 00:13:23.790
<v Speaker 1>People just don't ask for it though.</v>

484
00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:25.250
<v Speaker 1>People do ask for the fish.</v>

485
00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:26.233
<v Speaker 1>I video</v>

486
00:13:28.570 --> 00:13:31.740
<v Speaker 1>do it and behind it</v>

487
00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:36.440
<v Speaker 1>and ruin the pictures and you probably do like a thousand,</v>

488
00:13:36.450 --> 00:13:36.830
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

489
00:13:36.830 --> 00:13:37.440
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

490
00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:38.070
<v Speaker 1>More than that,</v>

491
00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:40.650
<v Speaker 1>more than the balance of this conversation.</v>

492
00:13:40.651 --> 00:13:41.630
<v Speaker 1>There's two of us filming.</v>

493
00:13:42.630 --> 00:13:46.590
<v Speaker 1>One of them is we're all just got to get used to the lights.</v>

494
00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:49.170
<v Speaker 1>Rhonda Bright Lights.</v>

495
00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:50.250
<v Speaker 1>This is what's gonna happen.</v>

496
00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:51.570
<v Speaker 1>They're gonna be a bunch of TMZ.</v>

497
00:13:51.571 --> 00:13:52.240
<v Speaker 1>Cameras.</v>

498
00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:52.600
<v Speaker 1>So you.</v>

499
00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:53.433
<v Speaker 1>Who Do you want to find out?</v>

500
00:13:53.930 --> 00:13:55.100
<v Speaker 1>Who's next for Misha?</v>

501
00:13:55.130 --> 00:13:55.440
<v Speaker 1>Misha.</v>

502
00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:57.850
<v Speaker 1>That's the one you want to fight?</v>

503
00:13:58.060 --> 00:13:58.893
<v Speaker 1>Her boyfriend,</v>

504
00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:00.673
<v Speaker 1>boyfriend.</v>

505

<v Speaker 1>Brian.</v>

506
00:14:03.770 --> 00:14:04.200
<v Speaker 1>What is that?</v>

507
00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:05.033
<v Speaker 1>Just the ultimate shits.</v>

508
00:14:05.090 --> 00:14:06.810
<v Speaker 1>It seemed like a really nice guy.</v>

509
00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:09.760
<v Speaker 1>That's what you actually know.</v>

510
00:14:09.761 --> 00:14:11.040
<v Speaker 1>The guy he fought in a</v>

511
00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:13.573
<v Speaker 1>very nice guy.</v>

00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:14.543
<v Speaker 1>Nice.</v>

00:14:14.660 --> 00:14:14.970
<v Speaker 1>Nice.</v>

514
00:14:14.970 --> 00:14:17.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm just trying to like Brian up.</v>

515
00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:19.430
<v Speaker 1>What was his name?</v>

516
00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:20.400
<v Speaker 1>However you say his last name?</v>

517
00:14:20.650 --> 00:14:21.500
<v Speaker 1>Tate Tate.</v>

00:14:21.530 --> 00:14:23.010

00:14:24.061 --> 00:14:24.894
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

521
00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:26.983
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:37.590
<v Speaker 1>I do like them both.</v>

525
00:14:37.591 --> 00:14:38.250
<v Speaker 1>I think they're both.</v>

526
00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:38.971
<v Speaker 1>Both variously.</v>

527
00:14:38.971 --> 00:14:40.170
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they like me very much.</v>

528
00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:46.020
<v Speaker 1>It seemed like you're very nice person but you should very competitive.</v>

529
00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:47.940
<v Speaker 1>Very competitive with everything.</v>

530
00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:49.590
<v Speaker 1>I'll have to like eat,</v>

531
00:14:49.591 --> 00:14:52.310
<v Speaker 1>like if we were eating lunch together and I try to finish my lunch before you.</v>

532
00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:53.390
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's like everything that's weird.</v>

534
00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:56.121
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

535
00:14:56.121 --> 00:14:58.460
<v Speaker 1>That's my like if I know I'm not good at it then screw it.</v>

536
00:14:58.461 --> 00:14:59.294
<v Speaker 1>I don't care.</v>

537
00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:02.210
<v Speaker 1>Like Michael Jordan,</v>

538
00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:05.690
<v Speaker 1>Michael Jordan and game of checkers.</v>

539
00:15:05.691 --> 00:15:06.524
<v Speaker 1>He fucking hates.</v>

540
00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:10.270
<v Speaker 1>Especially shit.</v>

541
00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:12.020
<v Speaker 1>He's trying to like pull,</v>

542
00:15:12.021 --> 00:15:13.190
<v Speaker 1>apparently beat him at pool.</v>

543
00:15:13.191 --> 00:15:14.024
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't want to talk to you</v>

544
00:15:15.970 --> 00:15:17.730
<v Speaker 1>like depressing lows in like I hate.</v>

545
00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:19.080
<v Speaker 1>I get a pool or something.</v>

546
00:15:19.530 --> 00:15:21.850
<v Speaker 1>Then you don't want to play me because it's so slow.</v>

547
00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:22.640
<v Speaker 1>The other person talks.</v>

548
00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:23.540
<v Speaker 1>Shifting your time.</v>

549
00:15:23.541 --> 00:15:26.390
<v Speaker 1>It makes it worse if you lose it and someone's talking to you,</v>

550
00:15:26.391 --> 00:15:27.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

551
00:15:27.550 --> 00:15:30.560
<v Speaker 1>but I can't make fun of a lot for losing pool.</v>

552
00:15:30.890 --> 00:15:33.020
<v Speaker 1>I think it's better to be good at jumping people in their heads.</v>

553
00:15:34.530 --> 00:15:38.510
<v Speaker 1>Like all my talent has got funneled into one area and like any sport with a</v>

554
00:15:38.511 --> 00:15:38.871
<v Speaker 1>ball,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

731

<v Speaker 1>if you're selling out arenas,</v>

732
00:20:59.851 --> 00:21:01.070
<v Speaker 1>you haven't going a lot of fucking money.</v>

733
00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:05.950
<v Speaker 1>Why of people come and see soulja boy concerts that I can't think of selling out</v>

734
00:21:05.951 --> 00:21:06.400
<v Speaker 1>of the,</v>

735
00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:07.061
<v Speaker 1>out of the loop,</v>

736
00:21:07.061 --> 00:21:07.291
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

737

<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>

738
00:21:08.290 --> 00:21:10.210
<v Speaker 1>I've got to think of selling out pretty big places.</v>

739
00:21:10.211 --> 00:21:11.320
<v Speaker 1>Soulja boy's got killed.</v>

<v Speaker 1>So when you bought $50,000,000 jets that what he did,</v>

741
00:21:13.871 --> 00:21:15.790
<v Speaker 1>he bought a $50 million dollars for his birthday.</v>

742
00:21:15.860 --> 00:21:17.510
<v Speaker 1>That was like the last news I heard about it,</v>

743
00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:21.490
<v Speaker 1>but maybe he lines and maybe got like conditions like partnership,</v>

744
00:21:21.491 --> 00:21:22.600
<v Speaker 1>fractional ownership.</v>

745
00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:24.810
<v Speaker 1>One of those things and shit.</v>

748
00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:34.720
<v Speaker 1>which is catchy,</v>

749
00:21:35.050 --> 00:21:38.390
<v Speaker 1>but I really $50,000,000 jet for that song,</v>

750
00:21:38.391 --> 00:21:39.224
<v Speaker 1>but it's amazing.</v>

758
00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:49.210
<v Speaker 1>to give a good statement,</v>

759

00:25:25.750 --> 00:25:26.860
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people say,</v>

885
00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:27.760
<v Speaker 1>Hey Brian,</v>

886
00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:27.910

889
00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:32.550
<v Speaker 1>But I train a lot now and just to roll it ties up a lot.</v>

890
00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:33.910
<v Speaker 1>A lot of stand up.</v>

891
00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:34.331
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

892
00:25:34.331 --> 00:25:35.470
<v Speaker 1>But meanwhile I,</v>

893
00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:36.750
<v Speaker 1>if I get punched in the nose,</v>

894
00:25:37.090 --> 00:25:38.550
<v Speaker 1>I got sucks.</v>

895
00:25:38.690 --> 00:25:39.750
<v Speaker 1>It's bad for you.</v>

896
00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:41.680
<v Speaker 1>Can't really transfer over for me and let's be honest,</v>

897
00:25:41.681 --> 00:25:43.780
<v Speaker 1>but it's just getting your nose broken.</v>

898
00:25:43.781 --> 00:25:44.710
<v Speaker 1>It's such a huge pain.</v>

899
00:25:44.711 --> 00:25:47.600
<v Speaker 1>That deck or it comes to going to the doctor and get straight to.</v>

900
00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:48.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

901
00:25:48.690 --> 00:25:52.570
<v Speaker 1>I have a friend who had a tongue ring and his tongue ring somewhere else through</v>

902
00:25:52.571 --> 00:25:53.111
<v Speaker 1>sleeping.</v>

903
00:25:53.111 --> 00:25:54.280
<v Speaker 1>Cracked a couple of his teeth.</v>

904
00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:55.900
<v Speaker 1>So they had extracted teeth,</v>

905
00:25:56.110 --> 00:25:56.831
<v Speaker 1>so he lost,</v>

906
00:25:56.831 --> 00:25:58.960
<v Speaker 1>like to have a side teeth because of a tongue ring.</v>

907
00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:01.720
<v Speaker 1>You can't stop shooting when by the way,</v>

908
00:26:01.721 --> 00:26:04.210
<v Speaker 1>I broke my nose and I can or I knocked my teeth out.</v>

909
00:26:04.211 --> 00:26:05.320
<v Speaker 1>We have what he did,</v>

910
00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:07.030
<v Speaker 1>but they give you like fake teeth for a little bit.</v>

911
00:26:07.170 --> 00:26:08.470
<v Speaker 1>It's really to do that.</v>

912
00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:08.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

913
00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:10.000
<v Speaker 1>They have to shut down production.</v>

914
00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:13.390
<v Speaker 1>They could do it pretty quickly I think give you like a little little bread,</v>

915
00:26:13.391 --> 00:26:15.820
<v Speaker 1>but I don't want to fuck dude,</v>

916
00:26:15.821 --> 00:26:16.654
<v Speaker 1>that's a drag.</v>

917
00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:18.670
<v Speaker 1>I do love training or I miss it a lot.</v>

918
00:26:18.730 --> 00:26:20.530
<v Speaker 1>So I've been doing it a little bit and it's been fun.</v>

919
00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:22.940
<v Speaker 1>But didn't you have like a crazy concussion?</v>

920
00:26:22.950 --> 00:26:23.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

928
00:26:29.021 --> 00:26:31.870

953
00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:08.300
<v Speaker 1>he kinda,</v>

954
00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:11.650
<v Speaker 1>we went against the wall and he was trying to take me down but he didn't know he</v>

955
00:27:11.651 --> 00:27:15.780
<v Speaker 1>wasn't doing a lot of take downs or something and I threw my hand into his</v>

956
00:27:15.781 --> 00:27:17.790
<v Speaker 1>fucking that was just to tick.</v>

957
00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:18.721
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

958
00:27:18.721 --> 00:27:20.000
<v Speaker 1>he took it out of the way and he's like.</v>

959
00:27:20.790 --> 00:27:23.460
<v Speaker 1>And then we went to the ground and the little bucket and he put me in an arm bar</v>

960
00:27:23.461 --> 00:27:24.294
<v Speaker 1>but he let me go.</v>

961
00:27:24.450 --> 00:27:25.350
<v Speaker 1>He would have killed me,</v>

962
00:27:25.730 --> 00:27:27.480
<v Speaker 1>but I was too stupid to know the difference.</v>

00:28:30.781 --> 00:28:33.150
<v Speaker 1>That's really important that people know who the fuck you are,</v>

1018
00:28:33.151 --> 00:28:33.630
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1019
00:28:33.630 --> 00:28:33.811
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1020
00:28:33.811 --> 00:28:35.220
<v Speaker 1>Well you've been tagged teaching me about.</v>

1021
00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:36.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm so lazy with that stuff,</v>

1022
00:28:36.511 --> 00:28:37.660
<v Speaker 1>but it's important because you know,</v>

1023
00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:38.520
<v Speaker 1>you want to get your.</v>

1024
00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:38.970
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1025
00:28:38.970 --> 00:28:41.900
<v Speaker 1>it's fun to get an audience and in connection with those people to,</v>

1026
00:28:42.060 --> 00:28:42.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1027
00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:43.710
<v Speaker 1>not just the podcast but twitter,</v>

1028
00:28:43.711 --> 00:28:44.221
<v Speaker 1>all that stuff.</v>

1029
00:28:44.221 --> 00:28:44.431
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1030
00:28:44.431 --> 00:28:45.330
<v Speaker 1>you're interacting with people.</v>

1031
00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:47.610
<v Speaker 1>I'm really anxious and people really appreciate it.</v>

1032
00:28:47.611 --> 00:28:47.740
<v Speaker 1>Which,</v>

1033
00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:48.600
<v Speaker 1>so it surprised me.</v>

1034
00:28:48.601 --> 00:28:51.660
<v Speaker 1>I had no idea that so many people listen to your podcasts and I did it when I do</v>

1035
00:28:51.661 --> 00:28:53.550
<v Speaker 1>the show and people come up to me and they,</v>

1036
00:28:53.770 --> 00:28:54.400
<v Speaker 1>and they,</v>

1037
00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:55.700
<v Speaker 1>they thanked me here.</v>

1038
00:28:55.710 --> 00:28:57.570
<v Speaker 1>They say I listen to on the Rogan podcasts.</v>

1039
00:28:57.571 --> 00:28:58.650
<v Speaker 1>It's a powerful medium.</v>

1040
00:28:58.651 --> 00:28:59.010
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1041
00:28:59.010 --> 00:28:59.671
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing.</v>

1042
00:28:59.671 --> 00:29:03.360
<v Speaker 1>We've never had anything like it before in human history as far as we know,</v>

1043
00:29:04.020 --> 00:29:07.620
<v Speaker 1>the idea that you can just have a pirate radio show and it's legal for now.</v>

1044
00:29:07.630 --> 00:29:10.330
<v Speaker 1>It's been talking about that before.</v>

1045
00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:10.801
<v Speaker 1>It's illegal.</v>

1046
00:29:10.801 --> 00:29:12.780
<v Speaker 1>Brian Sopa,</v>

1047
00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:16.160
<v Speaker 1>he thinks so motherfuckers,</v>

1048
00:29:16.530 --> 00:29:17.363
<v Speaker 1>they're going to say,</v>

1049
00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:18.120
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1050
00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:20.760
<v Speaker 1>we got to get bigger and bigger to the point where they can't stop it.</v>

1051
00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:21.511
<v Speaker 1>The ceiling.</v>

1052
00:29:21.511 --> 00:29:24.090
<v Speaker 1>Hope there are big enough to the point where when it rolls around,</v>

1053
00:29:24.091 --> 00:29:24.940
<v Speaker 1>it's too big stuff.</v>

1054
00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:25.590
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1055
00:29:25.590 --> 00:29:26.341
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly right.</v>

1056
00:29:26.341 --> 00:29:26.701
<v Speaker 1>You've got to.</v>

1057
00:29:26.701 --> 00:29:27.534
<v Speaker 1>You've got to figure out.</v>

1058
00:29:27.570 --> 00:29:28.740
<v Speaker 1>They want to pass legislation.</v>

1059
00:29:28.741 --> 00:29:29.760
<v Speaker 1>It's going to make the problem better.</v>

1060
00:29:29.761 --> 00:29:30.570
<v Speaker 1>Probably not.</v>

1061
00:29:30.570 --> 00:29:30.751
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1062
00:29:30.751 --> 00:29:34.320
<v Speaker 1>there's also people that are interested in launching their own satellites for</v>

1063
00:29:34.321 --> 00:29:35.640
<v Speaker 1>communication and for Internet.</v>

1064
00:29:35.641 --> 00:29:36.660
<v Speaker 1>If they shut down the Internet.</v>

1065
00:29:36.850 --> 00:29:39.050
<v Speaker 1>There's private companies that are talking about doing that.</v>

1066
00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:39.841
<v Speaker 1>The Tesla Guy,</v>

1067
00:29:39.841 --> 00:29:40.674
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>

1068
00:29:40.790 --> 00:29:42.130
<v Speaker 1>who started paypal,</v>

1069
00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:45.360
<v Speaker 1>he has a company that launches a private satellites,</v>

1070
00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:48.250
<v Speaker 1>so they're going to come up with a way to keep the internet going no matter</v>

1071
00:29:48.251 --> 00:29:48.520
<v Speaker 1>what.</v>

1072
00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:49.321
<v Speaker 1>At this point in time.</v>

1073
00:29:49.321 --> 00:29:50.820
<v Speaker 1>It's too many companies like,</v>

1074
00:29:50.860 --> 00:29:52.250
<v Speaker 1>like Google's antisocial,</v>

1075
00:29:52.270 --> 00:29:52.610
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1076
00:29:52.610 --> 00:29:53.443
<v Speaker 1>Aren't they?</v>

1077
00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:53.951
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1078
00:29:53.951 --> 00:29:54.251
<v Speaker 1>come on,</v>

1079
00:29:54.251 --> 00:29:54.670
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1080
00:29:54.670 --> 00:29:55.510
<v Speaker 1>If Google's anti,</v>

1081
00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:58.720
<v Speaker 1>so for that is also because you can technically under that law,</v>

1082
00:29:58.721 --> 00:30:01.510
<v Speaker 1>hold them accountable for things and they're like,</v>

1083
00:30:01.550 --> 00:30:02.383
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1084
00:30:02.490 --> 00:30:02.850
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

1085
00:30:02.850 --> 00:30:04.720
<v Speaker 1>my website would essentially have to shut down.</v>

1086
00:30:05.170 --> 00:30:06.003
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't.</v>

1087
00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:07.300
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't keep all those.</v>

1088
00:30:07.301 --> 00:30:08.270
<v Speaker 1>A toric stream.</v>

1089
00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:08.921
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

1090
00:30:08.921 --> 00:30:11.020
<v Speaker 1>we've done just fine without government intervention.</v>

1091
00:30:11.810 --> 00:30:13.720
<v Speaker 1>We've done just fine so we don't need.</v>

1092
00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:16.420
<v Speaker 1>We don't need a yet another group of government laws.</v>

1093
00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:17.351
<v Speaker 1>It's so gross.</v>

1094
00:30:17.351 --> 00:30:22.351
<v Speaker 1>Everything is regulated nowadays is stand up comedy and fucking that's it.</v>

1095
00:30:23.740 --> 00:30:24.460
<v Speaker 1>There's not much.</v>

1096
00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:25.720
<v Speaker 1>There's not much that make sense anymore.</v>

1097
00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:26.491
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>

1098
00:30:26.491 --> 00:30:28.520
<v Speaker 1>We're in a really weird time where they're,</v>

1099
00:30:28.521 --> 00:30:29.500
<v Speaker 1>they're scrambling,</v>

1100
00:30:29.501 --> 00:30:30.041
<v Speaker 1>like you said,</v>

1101
00:30:30.041 --> 00:30:31.000
<v Speaker 1>40,000 laws.</v>

1102
00:30:31.001 --> 00:30:31.840
<v Speaker 1>They passed last year.</v>

1103
00:30:32.170 --> 00:30:33.520
<v Speaker 1>Human beings figure themselves out.</v>

1104
00:30:33.521 --> 00:30:33.791
<v Speaker 1>They can.</v>

1105
00:30:33.791 --> 00:30:34.091
<v Speaker 1>We can.</v>

1106
00:30:34.091 --> 00:30:34.924
<v Speaker 1>We can get along.</v>

1107
00:30:35.530 --> 00:30:36.071
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>

1108
00:30:36.071 --> 00:30:40.780
<v Speaker 1>one of the other things is that that human beings actually and even primates are</v>

1109
00:30:40.781 --> 00:30:43.030
<v Speaker 1>very good at cooperation and working together.</v>

1110
00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:43.811
<v Speaker 1>Like we said,</v>

1111
00:30:43.811 --> 00:30:45.790
<v Speaker 1>there's always going to be people who do the wrong thing,</v>

1112
00:30:45.791 --> 00:30:46.630
<v Speaker 1>but for the most part,</v>

1113
00:30:46.631 --> 00:30:47.730
<v Speaker 1>if you look at the way society is working,</v>

1114
00:30:47.731 --> 00:30:51.430
<v Speaker 1>if you look at the way people actually behave in in catastrophes like tsunamis</v>

1115
00:30:51.431 --> 00:30:52.090
<v Speaker 1>and things,</v>

1116
00:30:52.090 --> 00:30:53.500
<v Speaker 1>they don't panic and running the streets.</v>

1117
00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:55.300
<v Speaker 1>They actually work together and help each other.</v>

1118
00:30:55.330 --> 00:30:58.630
<v Speaker 1>They get very calm and they start helping each other and they become very</v>

1119
00:30:58.631 --> 00:30:59.464
<v Speaker 1>communal</v>

1120
00:31:00.930 --> 00:31:05.020
<v Speaker 1>social and that's how we've survived through the millennia by cooperating with</v>

1121
00:31:05.021 --> 00:31:05.321
<v Speaker 1>each other,</v>

1122
00:31:05.321 --> 00:31:06.400
<v Speaker 1>by forming societies,</v>

1123
00:31:06.401 --> 00:31:08.560
<v Speaker 1>by forming rules for those Saturdays,</v>

1124
00:31:08.710 --> 00:31:13.390
<v Speaker 1>and we didn't need these huge central bodies organizing and running,</v>

1125
00:31:14.340 --> 00:31:16.150
<v Speaker 1>instructing the money from the system.</v>

1126
00:31:16.151 --> 00:31:19.090
<v Speaker 1>You twats I see half my money.</v>

1127
00:31:19.270 --> 00:31:20.530
<v Speaker 1>One love bitches does squad.</v>
