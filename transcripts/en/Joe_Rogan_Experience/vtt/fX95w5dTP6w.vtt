00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:09.800
<v Speaker 1>these Nazi furries like Neo Nazi furries.</v>

3
00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:10.440
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.440
<v Speaker 1>the absurd obscure a subculture of furries has a problem with mean any,</v>

5
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.070
<v Speaker 1>any groups of sexual abuse and a lot of Nazi,</v>

6
00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:20.581
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

7
00:00:20.581 --> 00:00:22.110

<v Speaker 1>Please just please cut the shit.</v>

9
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.020
<v Speaker 1>Please,</v>

10
00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:25.590
<v Speaker 1>please.</v>

11
00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:26.191
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>

12
00:00:26.191 --> 00:00:27.270
<v Speaker 1>I can't keep going.</v>

13
00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:28.373
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>

14
00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:29.370
<v Speaker 1>I can't keep going.</v>

15
00:00:29.371 --> 00:00:30.630
<v Speaker 1>It's just too crazy.</v>

16
00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.020
<v Speaker 1>Every day it's more and more fucking weird.</v>

17
00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:36.270
<v Speaker 1>This stuff I can get,</v>

18
00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.140
<v Speaker 1>I think this is the same people that watch those youtube videos or make the</v>

19
00:00:40.141 --> 00:00:40.980
<v Speaker 1>youtube videos.</v>

20
00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.110
<v Speaker 1>I think the people who make the youtube videos,</v>

21
00:00:43.111 --> 00:00:43.351
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

22
00:00:43.351 --> 00:00:44.600
<v Speaker 1>I think it's just like they're,</v>

23
00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:47.730
<v Speaker 1>they're in Asia or somewhere like that and they have a script and they just keep</v>

24
00:00:47.731 --> 00:00:50.730
<v Speaker 1>throwing the script over and over and we're looking for like hidden messages in</v>

25
00:00:50.731 --> 00:00:51.550
<v Speaker 1>the script.</v>

26
00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.100
<v Speaker 1>I think the script is probably just fucked up.</v>

27
00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.460
<v Speaker 1>They think it's fucked up to have a cartoon character hit himself in the head</v>

28
00:00:56.461 --> 00:00:58.320
<v Speaker 1>with a bottle and I think you're probably right.</v>

29
00:00:58.321 --> 00:01:01.230
<v Speaker 1>Like maybe these fucking child predators,</v>

30
00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:03.570
<v Speaker 1>maybe they communicate on all sorts of different websites.</v>

31
00:01:03.571 --> 00:01:04.710
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they just decide like,</v>

32
00:01:04.711 --> 00:01:04.891
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

33
00:01:04.891 --> 00:01:09.420
<v Speaker 1>let's meet on this tire forum and we'll just say things in code and attire means</v>

34
00:01:09.421 --> 00:01:09.890
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

35
00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:10.011
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

36
00:01:10.011 --> 00:01:11.730
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't that always the shit with pizza gate,</v>

37
00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:13.650
<v Speaker 1>like they thought that they were talking in code.</v>

38
00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.670
<v Speaker 1>Like all the conspiracy theorists thought that a slice of pizza meant like a kid</v>

39
00:01:17.671 --> 00:01:18.570
<v Speaker 1>and the youtube one,</v>

40
00:01:18.571 --> 00:01:22.830
<v Speaker 1>I mean them being there being so many of them sort of says that there's money in</v>

41
00:01:22.831 --> 00:01:23.410
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

42
00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:26.370
<v Speaker 1>They've tapped into the algorithm and they're just beating it to death.</v>

43
00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.671
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

44
00:01:26.671 --> 00:01:29.820
<v Speaker 1>and they just have the same script and they just do it with a computer change.</v>

45
00:01:29.821 --> 00:01:30.440
<v Speaker 1>One little thing,</v>

46
00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.430
<v Speaker 1>a little thing here and there and that's what I think it is.</v>

47
00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.260
<v Speaker 1>I think it's not as nefarious as everybody likes to thank,</v>

48
00:01:34.261 --> 00:01:39.090
<v Speaker 1>but it's really fucking weird to keep seeing the same video playing out over and</v>

49
00:01:39.091 --> 00:01:41.880
<v Speaker 1>over again with a bottle flies through the hair and the baby gets hit in the</v>

50
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:42.720
<v Speaker 1>fucking head.</v>

51
00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:43.553
<v Speaker 1>And utilities,</v>

52
00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.220
<v Speaker 1>I think the activity was a little weird or when it's people actually people</v>

53
00:01:47.221 --> 00:01:47.770
<v Speaker 1>doing it,</v>

54
00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.440
<v Speaker 1>you can't just grab a computer,</v>

55
00:01:49.441 --> 00:01:50.790
<v Speaker 1>make it to where people are.</v>

56
00:01:50.791 --> 00:01:51.900
<v Speaker 1>God damn nuts.</v>

57
00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.370
<v Speaker 1>They're nuts and they're out there.</v>

58

62
00:02:00.301 --> 00:02:00.991
<v Speaker 1>much what that is.</v>

63
00:02:00.991 --> 00:02:02.700

64
00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.140

<v Speaker 1>hair and they pumped fat into their ass and put silicone bags and their tits?</v>

100

<v Speaker 1>Why is that okay,</v>

101
00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.130
<v Speaker 1>but it's not okay to dress like a big chicken and get fucked by a big rooster.</v>

<v Speaker 2>that's bull shit.</v>

148
00:04:07.911 --> 00:04:08.390
<v Speaker 2>We ain't mad.</v>

149
00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:11.750
<v Speaker 2>You ain't one fucking time that we ever did anything pleasurable together,</v>

150
00:04:11.751 --> 00:04:13.760
<v Speaker 2>motherfucker and was very go off.</v>

151
00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:15.110
<v Speaker 2>But he didn't have any.</v>

152
00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:16.640
<v Speaker 2>So when he didn't have any files,</v>

153
00:04:16.641 --> 00:04:16.890
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

154
00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:19.070
<v Speaker 2>Now that's the same recollection that I hadn't done it,</v>

155
00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:23.960
<v Speaker 2>but I really didn't forgive him until this last heart attack in June.</v>

156
00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:27.920
<v Speaker 2>And what happened then when I had the heart attack in June and it seemed like,</v>

157
00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:29.200
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

158
00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.650
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

159
00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:29.781
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

160
00:04:29.781 --> 00:04:31.970
<v Speaker 2>revelation came to me and he was like,</v>

161
00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:33.030
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

162
00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:34.520
<v Speaker 2>it's not hurting him.</v>

163
00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.590
<v Speaker 2>It's not hurting him at all.</v>

164
00:04:36.591 --> 00:04:38.420
<v Speaker 2>My Dad is 86 years old.</v>

165
00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:39.501
<v Speaker 2>He's fine,</v>

166
00:04:39.501 --> 00:04:39.891
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

167
00:04:39.891 --> 00:04:40.091
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

168
00:04:40.091 --> 00:04:40.311
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

169
00:04:40.311 --> 00:04:40.671
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

170
00:04:40.671 --> 00:04:41.150
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

171
00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.870
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

172
00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:42.351
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>

173
00:04:42.351 --> 00:04:42.531
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

174
00:04:42.531 --> 00:04:42.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

175
00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:47.160
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he thinks that he has anything to be sorry for that.</v>

176
00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:47.961
<v Speaker 2>I think he thinks he's,</v>

177
00:04:47.961 --> 00:04:50.330
<v Speaker 2>he's done a fantastic job of raising me.</v>

178
00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:51.141
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

179
00:04:51.141 --> 00:04:51.560
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

180
00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.080
<v Speaker 2>I was just waiting on the policy who was never going to come,</v>

181
00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.800
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

182
00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.670
<v Speaker 2>but it was still that hate that I have for him was eating me up.</v>

183
00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.040
<v Speaker 2>I had to get that burden off me.</v>

184
00:05:01.041 --> 00:05:02.450
<v Speaker 2>And I think having that labs harder,</v>

185
00:05:02.451 --> 00:05:06.740
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to die carrying that burden with me of hating my dad.</v>

186
00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:10.550
<v Speaker 2>So I went to my dad and I asked him to forgive me.</v>

187
00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:12.043
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

296
00:08:05.151 --> 00:08:10.151
<v Speaker 2>so one of my trophies broke and my mom took me to some place to fix it.</v>

297
00:08:10.341 --> 00:08:13.850
<v Speaker 2>And I did not know that there was a place that existed when I just thought</v>

298
00:08:13.851 --> 00:08:14.960
<v Speaker 2>trophies appeared.</v>

299
00:08:14.961 --> 00:08:15.120
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

300
00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:15.291
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

301
00:08:15.291 --> 00:08:16.390
<v Speaker 2>as a kid you just get shot,</v>

302
00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:17.000
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

303
00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.320
<v Speaker 2>So when I saw this was the spot,</v>

304
00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:19.940
<v Speaker 2>what I used to do,</v>

305
00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:24.440
<v Speaker 2>because I was saving my allowance and I would go to the trophy spot and buy like</v>

306
00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:25.460
<v Speaker 2>a karate trophy,</v>

307
00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:32.600
<v Speaker 2>just walk around the neighborhood just long enough for this one dude to see me</v>

308
00:08:32.601 --> 00:08:34.610
<v Speaker 2>who I knew would be like the town crier.</v>

309
00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:36.650
<v Speaker 2>And I would always act embarrassed about it.</v>

310
00:08:36.651 --> 00:08:36.830
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

311
00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:36.951
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

312
00:08:36.951 --> 00:08:37.790
<v Speaker 2>you don't understand yet.</v>

313
00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:38.991
<v Speaker 2>And that's how we talk.</v>

314
00:08:38.991 --> 00:08:39.824
<v Speaker 2>We say young and stuff.</v>

315
00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:42.620
<v Speaker 2>And then when my mother got me taking karate and shit,</v>

316
00:08:42.621 --> 00:08:43.400
<v Speaker 2>I'm wanting to stay with them.</v>

317
00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:43.551
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

318
00:08:43.551 --> 00:08:43.770
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

319
00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:45.260
<v Speaker 2>you wanna cry you nights like that.</v>

320
00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:47.750
<v Speaker 2>Don't tell nobody,</v>

321
00:08:47.751 --> 00:08:48.050
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

322
00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:48.890
<v Speaker 2>I ain't gonna say shit.</v>

323
00:08:48.891 --> 00:08:49.724
<v Speaker 2>And then I would see.</v>

324
00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:50.540
<v Speaker 2>So then,</v>

325
00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:51.373
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

326
00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:53.223
<v Speaker 2>and then like,</v>

327
00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:53.511
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

328
00:08:53.511 --> 00:08:54.440
<v Speaker 2>a couple of months ago by,</v>

329
00:08:54.441 --> 00:08:55.800
<v Speaker 2>I go by and by a little bigger too.</v>

330
00:08:57.950 --> 00:08:59.010
<v Speaker 2>Dude never messed with me.</v>

331
00:08:59.011 --> 00:08:59.731
<v Speaker 2>He never met.</v>

332
00:08:59.731 --> 00:09:00.181
<v Speaker 2>Thank God.</v>

333
00:09:00.181 --> 00:09:00.961
<v Speaker 2>Thank God.</v>

334
00:09:00.961 --> 00:09:01.650
<v Speaker 2>No one was like,</v>

335
00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:01.891
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

336
00:09:01.891 --> 00:09:02.400
<v Speaker 2>I could fight,</v>

337
00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:03.100
<v Speaker 2>but I did.</v>

338
00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:03.571
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>

339
00:09:03.571 --> 00:09:08.571
<v Speaker 2>But it was like the word got out enough because nobody knew what I'm saying.</v>

340
00:09:09.001 --> 00:09:10.830
<v Speaker 2>Like if you heard a d a Dude Dicker Ronnie,</v>

341
00:09:10.831 --> 00:09:11.670
<v Speaker 2>that was enough.</v>

342
00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:13.470
<v Speaker 2>Like you didn't want to get embarrassed.</v>

343
00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:17.540
<v Speaker 2>So he gave me like free passage to do,</v>

344
00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:20.190
<v Speaker 2>to be my corny self be out.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

346
00:09:21.130 --> 00:09:23.130
<v Speaker 2>That's a very clever way of handling it.</v>

347
00:09:23.131 --> 00:09:25.680
<v Speaker 2>That's what I did when I saw that store.</v>

348
00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:26.573
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

349
00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:30.030
<v Speaker 2>and this the piece of whom they would like five bucks,</v>

350
00:09:30.031 --> 00:09:30.481
<v Speaker 2>seven bucks,</v>

351
00:09:30.481 --> 00:09:30.841
<v Speaker 2>three bucks,</v>

352
00:09:30.841 --> 00:09:32.070
<v Speaker 2>and then we'll go put it on,</v>

353
00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:34.800
<v Speaker 2>and then someone was acting at an early age.</v>

354
00:09:34.801 --> 00:09:35.634
<v Speaker 2>There's all of that shit.</v>

355
00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:36.931
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

356
00:09:36.931 --> 00:09:37.790
<v Speaker 2>I know where he going to be.</v>

357
00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:39.031
<v Speaker 2>As soon as he saw me,</v>

358
00:09:39.031 --> 00:09:39.740
<v Speaker 2>I'd go back and I also,</v>

359
00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:40.860
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want him like a big,</v>

360
00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:41.670
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

361
00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:42.800
<v Speaker 2>That's very clever.</v>

362
00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:52.860
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
