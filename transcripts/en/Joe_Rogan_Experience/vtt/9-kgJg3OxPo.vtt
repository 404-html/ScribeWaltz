<v Speaker 1>This episode of the Joe Rogan experience podcast brought to you by squarespace.</v>

9
00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.720
<v Speaker 1>Squarespace is a website that allows you to build websites and allows you to do</v>

10
00:00:24.721 --> 00:00:29.721
<v Speaker 1>it in a way that a moron like me could actually make a website if you could do</v>

11
00:00:30.961 --> 00:00:32.060
<v Speaker 1>the normal functions of,</v>

12
00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:33.570
<v Speaker 1>of using a computer,</v>

13
00:00:33.571 --> 00:00:34.860
<v Speaker 1>like clicking on icons,</v>

14
00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:35.461
<v Speaker 1>dragging,</v>

15
00:00:35.461 --> 00:00:36.540
<v Speaker 1>selecting pictures,</v>

16
00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.520
<v Speaker 1>dragging shit,</v>

17
00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:39.900
<v Speaker 1>click and drag it pitch.</v>

18
00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:40.500
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

19
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.310
<v Speaker 1>if you do that,</v>

20
00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:41.851
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>

21
00:00:41.851 --> 00:00:42.090
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

22
00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.700
<v Speaker 1>you can make an awesome website and it looks incredibly professional.</v>

23
00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:46.770
<v Speaker 1>Twenty bad ass designs,</v>

24
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.290
<v Speaker 1>custom images and content that you provide.</v>

25
00:00:49.291 --> 00:00:49.561
<v Speaker 1>You can,</v>

26
00:00:49.561 --> 00:00:49.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

27
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:50.521
<v Speaker 1>you can use your own style,</v>

28
00:00:50.521 --> 00:00:51.540
<v Speaker 1>have to use their images.</v>

29
00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.780
<v Speaker 1>They have 24 slash seven super fast email support and they also have a new</v>

30
00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.880
<v Speaker 1>ecommerce product so you could start a website and start a store with</v>

31
00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.410
<v Speaker 1>squarespace.com really quickly.</v>

32
00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.020
<v Speaker 1>And their new product is Galapagos.</v>

33
00:01:07.021 --> 00:01:10.230
<v Speaker 1>It's a new template that will showcase your ecommerce products in a more</v>

34
00:01:10.231 --> 00:01:14.730
<v Speaker 1>interesting way than the typical ordinary grid and galapagos features a dynamic</v>

35
00:01:14.731 --> 00:01:17.070
<v Speaker 1>product mosaic with custom role overstates.</v>

36
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.320
<v Speaker 1>So like if you put your cursor over something,</v>

37
00:01:19.321 --> 00:01:20.280
<v Speaker 1>the image changes,</v>

38
00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.940
<v Speaker 1>so if you hover when the visitors hover over each item,</v>

39
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.530
<v Speaker 1>the you can have like a one color,</v>

40
00:01:25.531 --> 00:01:29.490
<v Speaker 1>one black and white and make it fancy and the template is also preset.</v>

41
00:01:29.491 --> 00:01:34.410
<v Speaker 1>With all the content pages you need to have your shop up and running quickly.</v>

42
00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.981
<v Speaker 1>Musicians,</v>

43
00:01:34.981 --> 00:01:35.940
<v Speaker 1>it's great for musicians.</v>

44
00:01:35.941 --> 00:01:36.960
<v Speaker 1>You can sell music,</v>

45
00:01:36.961 --> 00:01:41.310
<v Speaker 1>digital downloads and merchandise and you could set up a calendar like really</v>

46
00:01:41.311 --> 00:01:41.580
<v Speaker 1>easy.</v>

47
00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:42.060
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

48
00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.710
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

49

106
00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:15.263
<v Speaker 1>Not think so.</v>

107
00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:16.840
<v Speaker 1>Every time I get roses for a girl,</v>

108
00:03:16.841 --> 00:03:17.260
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

109
00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.870
<v Speaker 1>what are you like 1992 just talking to you.</v>

110
00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

111
00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.300
<v Speaker 1>probably one 800 flowers has a.</v>

112
00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.130
<v Speaker 1>They have a Christmas centerpiece that you can get.</v>

113
00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.000
<v Speaker 1>The Christmas centerpiece is this huge thing.</v>

114
00:03:31.001 --> 00:03:33.700
<v Speaker 1>Like can you go to one 800 flowers and see their Christmas centerpiece.</v>

115
00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.030
<v Speaker 1>So all of these beautiful flowers are cool as fuck.</v>

116
00:03:37.031 --> 00:03:40.150
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's really weird what beauty is when you stop thinking about it.</v>

117
00:03:40.151 --> 00:03:44.470
<v Speaker 1>Like why are we drawn to particular plants and to particular sunsets and</v>

118
00:03:44.471 --> 00:03:45.251
<v Speaker 1>sunrises.</v>

119
00:03:45.251 --> 00:03:48.430
<v Speaker 1>Like what is it about beautiful things that's so appealing and attractive and</v>

120
00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:49.690
<v Speaker 1>what it does to us.</v>

121
00:03:49.691 --> 00:03:52.570
<v Speaker 1>That sense of too weird.</v>

122
00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.630
<v Speaker 1>So weird aspect of being a human that I don't think animals share living.</v>

123
00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.930
<v Speaker 1>They do.</v>

124
00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:58.470
<v Speaker 1>They just can't talk about them.</v>

125
00:03:58.471 --> 00:04:00.460
<v Speaker 1>I know I've used these guys a lot.</v>

126
00:04:00.461 --> 00:04:00.851
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

127
00:04:00.851 --> 00:04:01.090
<v Speaker 1>Joe.</v>

128
00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.210
<v Speaker 1>I've used one 800 flowers at time and they are a great company.</v>

129
00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

130
00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:09.430
<v Speaker 1>they have a great reputation and the flowers are beautiful and expertly crafted</v>

131
00:04:09.431 --> 00:04:13.750
<v Speaker 1>by local florists and hand delivered to your door so they have like a whole</v>

132
00:04:13.751 --> 00:04:16.770
<v Speaker 1>network of people that they use all over the country that are excellent florists</v>

133
00:04:16.771 --> 00:04:21.280
<v Speaker 1>so they get it to you quickly filled with red roses and white lilies and more</v>

134
00:04:21.281 --> 00:04:23.380
<v Speaker 1>this bright seasonal centerpiece.</v>

135
00:04:23.381 --> 00:04:25.630
<v Speaker 1>It's accented with fragrant evergreens,</v>

136
00:04:25.631 --> 00:04:26.441
<v Speaker 1>pine cones,</v>

137
00:04:26.441 --> 00:04:28.600
<v Speaker 1>and topped off with a red velvet ribbon and candles.</v>

138
00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:32.070
<v Speaker 1>If you want to convince a girl that you're gay kid or this.</v>

139
00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:37.290
<v Speaker 1>This is what I love and I would love it if you got me.</v>

140
00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:39.310
<v Speaker 1>Mike got me this and I was so happy.</v>

141
00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:40.293
<v Speaker 1>Who's Mike?</v>

142
00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.250
<v Speaker 1>You know the guy in the office and I really like.</v>

143
00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:44.530
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

144
00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:47.260
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if they have like a service because this would be cool to always have</v>

<v Speaker 4>I could not figure out why there were these women there.</v>

291
00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:05.010
<v Speaker 4>I had no idea that you just.</v>

292
00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:08.580
<v Speaker 4>It was almost like it was scripted because you said that and then they showed</v>

293
00:09:08.581 --> 00:09:09.930
<v Speaker 4>you was the most inane,</v>

294
00:09:09.931 --> 00:09:11.190
<v Speaker 4>stupid piece of shit.</v>

295
00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:12.870
<v Speaker 4>I didn't even know that was coming up next.</v>

296
00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:13.411
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>

297
00:09:13.411 --> 00:09:14.221
<v Speaker 4>It was perfect.</v>

298
00:09:14.221 --> 00:09:14.940
<v Speaker 4>You couldn't have been.</v>

299
00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:17.050
<v Speaker 4>What if they went to some series news and fucked,</v>

<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

301
00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:18.661
<v Speaker 4>he wanted to.</v>

302
00:09:18.661 --> 00:09:20.640
<v Speaker 4>You could see in his face as he read the teleprompter,</v>

303
00:09:20.641 --> 00:09:21.091
<v Speaker 4>he was like,</v>

304
00:09:21.091 --> 00:09:21.361
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>

305
00:09:21.361 --> 00:09:23.850
<v Speaker 4>we're going to get out of this and go ah shit.</v>

306
00:09:23.851 --> 00:09:27.330
<v Speaker 4>And it's like completely proved your point.</v>

310
00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:31.560
<v Speaker 4>How did Kirk get laid?</v>

311
00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:32.431
<v Speaker 4>He could skip.</v>

00:09:32.431 --> 00:09:33.720
<v Speaker 4>Really wrote did he got laid.</v>

313
00:09:33.721 --> 00:09:35.220
<v Speaker 4>The writers made him get laid down.</v>

314
00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:36.113
<v Speaker 4>A real guy.</v>

315
00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:40.890
<v Speaker 4>Jesus fucking aliens to wars going on.</v>

316
00:09:40.891 --> 00:09:44.190
<v Speaker 4>The entire banking system had to be bailed out by taxpayers' money.</v>

317
00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:45.320
<v Speaker 4>He was running aliens.</v>

318
00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:47.250
<v Speaker 4>They just wanted to see what a human cock was like.</v>

319
00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:48.210
<v Speaker 4>That's how he got laid.</v>

320
00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:51.270
<v Speaker 4>Do you think they have like a bunch of shit that they will throw out there,</v>

321
00:09:51.271 --> 00:09:55.230
<v Speaker 4>like beach balls to distract and they get like they get it from the CIA every</v>

322
00:09:55.231 --> 00:09:56.064
<v Speaker 4>week.</v>

323
00:09:56.190 --> 00:09:57.030
<v Speaker 4>Star Trek check.</v>

324
00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:58.630
<v Speaker 4>You just have to send it this way.</v>

325
00:09:58.650 --> 00:10:02.160
<v Speaker 4>We want you to talk about this week like Zap the American mind.</v>

326
00:10:03.890 --> 00:10:04.320
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

327
00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:04.560
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

328
00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:04.970
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

329
00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:05.210
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

330
00:10:05.210 --> 00:10:05.780
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

331
00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:06.613
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

332
00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:07.633
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

333
00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:09.150
<v Speaker 4>I don't believe that it is.</v>

334
00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:09.720
<v Speaker 4>I don't believe.</v>

335
00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:13.970
<v Speaker 4>I think I tend to think that it's more in competence than conspiracy.</v>

336
00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:15.360
<v Speaker 4>I conspiracy ratings.</v>

337
00:10:15.361 --> 00:10:17.010
<v Speaker 4>They don't actually care about the news.</v>

338
00:10:17.011 --> 00:10:18.150
<v Speaker 4>They only care about ratings.</v>

339
00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:19.110
<v Speaker 4>They don't care about the news,</v>

340
00:10:19.111 --> 00:10:20.700
<v Speaker 4>but I think in general,</v>

341
00:10:20.701 --> 00:10:25.701
<v Speaker 4>like even the most of what we think of as being this big gigantic conspiracy</v>

342
00:10:25.981 --> 00:10:30.981
<v Speaker 4>with our government and the media is more in competence and Horesh behavior than</v>

343
00:10:31.171 --> 00:10:31.710
<v Speaker 4>anything.</v>

344
00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:32.820
<v Speaker 4>Just they're prostitutes.</v>

345
00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:36.420
<v Speaker 4>Prostituted themselves out because that's where they got the good assignments.</v>

346
00:10:36.421 --> 00:10:37.290
<v Speaker 4>They got to the good places.</v>

347
00:10:37.291 --> 00:10:38.400
<v Speaker 4>They got the big ratings.</v>

348
00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:39.061
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

349
00:10:39.061 --> 00:10:39.920
<v Speaker 4>you don't get to that</v>

350
00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:40.230
<v Speaker 5>point.</v>

351
00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:43.890
<v Speaker 5>You don't get to that job unless you've proved yourself a faithful foot soldier</v>

352
00:10:43.891 --> 00:10:46.380
<v Speaker 5>to whatever their messages generally,</v>

353
00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:46.710
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

354
00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:47.340
<v Speaker 5>they're not,</v>

355
00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:48.330
<v Speaker 5>you're not gonna get hired on.</v>

356
00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:49.400
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

357
00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:51.720
<v Speaker 4>And even guys that used to be Kinda like rebels,</v>

358
00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:56.040
<v Speaker 4>like Geraldo Rivera rather rivera was kind of a rebel at one point.</v>

359
00:10:57.210 --> 00:11:02.210
<v Speaker 4>He was the guy that had Dick Gregory on TV and film for the first time I got in</v>

360
00:11:02.461 --> 00:11:04.560
<v Speaker 4>a fistfight at a KKK rally,</v>

361
00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:05.401
<v Speaker 4>I think on a show.</v>

362
00:11:05.401 --> 00:11:06.960
<v Speaker 4>If someone hit him in the head with a chair,</v>

363
00:11:07.690 --> 00:11:09.060
<v Speaker 4>they might not even been trying to hit him.</v>

364
00:11:09.061 --> 00:11:12.240
<v Speaker 4>It was just a melee and I think a chair went flying and he got his nose broken</v>

365
00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:12.901
<v Speaker 4>and he was fucked up.</v>

366
00:11:12.901 --> 00:11:13.740
<v Speaker 4>But then he was so excited,</v>

367
00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:16.230
<v Speaker 4>so excited to have actual cut on his face.</v>

368
00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:17.350
<v Speaker 4>I'm a tough guy.</v>

369
00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:18.100
<v Speaker 4>Like what's.</v>

370
00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:21.570
<v Speaker 4>He was supposed to box frank stallone or something crazy like that too,</v>

371
00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:23.070
<v Speaker 4>a long time ago.</v>

372
00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:23.581
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>

373
00:11:23.581 --> 00:11:24.600
<v Speaker 4>They might have actually done it.</v>

374
00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:25.823
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

375
00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:26.611
<v Speaker 4>I'm pretty sure,</v>

376
00:11:26.611 --> 00:11:27.720
<v Speaker 4>but he's a wild dude,</v>

377
00:11:27.721 --> 00:11:29.340
<v Speaker 4>or at least he was a wild dude,</v>

378
00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:30.121
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

379
00:11:30.121 --> 00:11:32.580
<v Speaker 4>and now he's just like Fox News puppet.</v>

380
00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:34.450
<v Speaker 4>It's weird when you see the,</v>

381
00:11:34.451 --> 00:11:35.660
<v Speaker 4>the ones that actually stick</v>

382
00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:36.201
<v Speaker 5>to their guns,</v>

383
00:11:36.201 --> 00:11:37.430
<v Speaker 5>they don't last long.</v>

384
00:11:37.431 --> 00:11:40.620
<v Speaker 5>I mean Cenk Yoga lasted two months at Msnbc before he,</v>

385
00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:41.750
<v Speaker 5>before he needed to leave.</v>

386
00:11:41.751 --> 00:11:45.590
<v Speaker 5>Amber Lyon is another one that left because her Bahrain story actually you</v>

387
00:11:45.591 --> 00:11:46.424
<v Speaker 5>mentioned Bahrain,</v>

388
00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:46.820
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

389
00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:47.630
<v Speaker 5>CNN,</v>

390
00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:49.820
<v Speaker 5>she brought it back to them and said this is what's going on by rain.</v>

391
00:11:49.821 --> 00:11:53.580
<v Speaker 5>But they were doing ads talking about how great Bahrain was and wouldn't play or</v>

392
00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:54.423
<v Speaker 5>segment.</v>

393
00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:54.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

394
00:11:54.890 --> 00:11:55.140
<v Speaker 2>She,</v>

395
00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:55.610
<v Speaker 2>she's</v>

396
00:11:55.610 --> 00:11:57.610
<v Speaker 6>podcasts before and she explained it all to us and it's,</v>

397
00:11:57.611 --> 00:12:02.390
<v Speaker 6>it's so hard to believe that what we consider to be like a shining,</v>

398
00:12:02.391 --> 00:12:04.160
<v Speaker 6>revered institution of news,</v>

399
00:12:04.161 --> 00:12:07.810
<v Speaker 6>like CNN has just a bullshit propaganda wing that they,</v>

400
00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:09.470
<v Speaker 6>they're capable of that kind of behavior.</v>

401
00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:10.520
<v Speaker 6>If she's telling the truth.</v>

402
00:12:10.610 --> 00:12:11.330
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>

403
00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:12.163
<v Speaker 6>I wasn't there.</v>

404
00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:13.070
<v Speaker 6>I assume she is.</v>

405
00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:14.060
<v Speaker 6>She seems very honest.</v>

406
00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:16.280
<v Speaker 6>I don't know anybody else's side on the other side.</v>

407
00:12:16.281 --> 00:12:16.801
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>

408
00:12:16.801 --> 00:12:18.470
<v Speaker 6>I don't know what the fuck is really going on,</v>

409
00:12:18.650 --> 00:12:21.500
<v Speaker 6>so I probably shouldn't comment on what CNN did or didn't do,</v>

410
00:12:21.501 --> 00:12:24.200
<v Speaker 6>but I know for a fact they're not reporting a lot of shit.</v>

411
00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:27.240
<v Speaker 2>We're putting a lot of shit and I feel like all of these networks,</v>

412
00:12:27.241 --> 00:12:28.160
<v Speaker 2>that mainstream media,</v>

413
00:12:28.161 --> 00:12:32.450
<v Speaker 2>it's a very small box of accepted thought that is allowed on them.</v>

414
00:12:33.710 --> 00:12:34.190
<v Speaker 2>It's not.</v>

415
00:12:34.190 --> 00:12:34.760
<v Speaker 2>It's not.</v>

416
00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:39.110
<v Speaker 2>They're not going to go either very far to to either side or outside that box.</v>

417
00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:40.130
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

418
00:12:40.130 --> 00:12:40.650
<v Speaker 2>it's not</v>

419
00:12:40.650 --> 00:12:43.400
<v Speaker 6>really the news and that's one of the more interesting things about the internet</v>

420
00:12:43.401 --> 00:12:44.940
<v Speaker 6>is because the Internet now,</v>

421
00:12:44.941 --> 00:12:48.390
<v Speaker 6>there's all these sources that are like more real news,</v>

422
00:12:48.391 --> 00:12:51.150
<v Speaker 6>like they're telling you about shit that's going on that you might not have</v>

423
00:12:51.151 --> 00:12:51.700
<v Speaker 6>known.</v>

424
00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:56.700
<v Speaker 6>I could just see this thing about the CIA dude who's a fake CIA guy for like 10</v>

425
00:12:57.511 --> 00:12:57.950
<v Speaker 6>years.</v>

426
00:12:57.950 --> 00:12:58.380
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

427
00:12:58.380 --> 00:12:58.561
<v Speaker 6>here,</v>

428
00:12:58.561 --> 00:12:59.970
<v Speaker 6>let me pull it up when I can.</v>

429
00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:01.380
<v Speaker 6>If I can get a chance here,</v>

430
00:13:01.381 --> 00:13:06.381
<v Speaker 6>but I think that what we're seeing now with the Internet and with just this</v>

431
00:13:06.690 --> 00:13:11.690
<v Speaker 6>incredible influx of like daily information about life,</v>

432
00:13:11.821 --> 00:13:12.571
<v Speaker 6>about science,</v>

433
00:13:12.571 --> 00:13:14.450
<v Speaker 6>about the real reality of</v>

434
00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:15.473
<v Speaker 2>people don't.</v>

435
00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:16.291
<v Speaker 2>People are waking up.</v>

436
00:13:16.291 --> 00:13:17.400
<v Speaker 2>I mean it is slow.</v>

437
00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:18.031
<v Speaker 2>It's a slow,</v>

438
00:13:18.031 --> 00:13:19.050
<v Speaker 2>painful process,</v>

439
00:13:19.051 --> 00:13:19.650
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

440

<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>

441

<v Speaker 2>People are waking up.</v>

442
00:13:20.881 --> 00:13:21.300
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

443
00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:22.560
<v Speaker 2>I mean with Syria,</v>

444
00:13:22.561 --> 00:13:26.130
<v Speaker 2>that was the first time I've ever seen our war machine and our media war machine</v>

445
00:13:26.131 --> 00:13:28.470
<v Speaker 2>get it into high gear and people were like,</v>

446
00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:30.540
<v Speaker 2>I don't think we need to bomb the shit out of Syria.</v>

447
00:13:30.930 --> 00:13:31.830
<v Speaker 2>Listened and yeah,</v>

00:13:32.461 --> 00:13:32.710
<v Speaker 2>That,</v>

451
00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:33.960
<v Speaker 2>we were talking about that the other day.</v>

452
00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:34.823
<v Speaker 2>At the</v>

453
00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:37.050
<v Speaker 2>first time that,</v>

454
00:13:37.051 --> 00:13:38.160
<v Speaker 2>that really did happen.</v>

455
00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:38.881
<v Speaker 2>The public said,</v>

456
00:13:38.881 --> 00:13:39.181

460
00:13:41.191 --> 00:13:42.170
<v Speaker 2>we don't need to go there.</v>

461
00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:42.691
<v Speaker 2>Come on.</v>

462

00:13:42.871 --> 00:13:46.200
<v Speaker 2>we were just saying we just wanted to see what you guys thought.</v>

464
00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:47.250
<v Speaker 2>So sweat this dude,</v>

465
00:13:47.310 --> 00:13:47.970

466
00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:52.290
<v Speaker 2>the EPA is highest paid employee and a leading expert in climate change deserves</v>

467
00:13:52.291 --> 00:13:56.400
<v Speaker 2>to go to prison for at least 30 months for lying to his bosses and saying that</v>

468
00:13:56.401 --> 00:14:01.401
<v Speaker 2>he was a CIA spy working in Pakistan so that he could avoid doing his real job</v>

469
00:14:02.370 --> 00:14:03.750
<v Speaker 2>says the federal prosecutors.</v>

470
00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:04.800
<v Speaker 2>So the dude,</v>

471
00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:06.600
<v Speaker 2>how slick is this cat?</v>

472
00:14:06.810 --> 00:14:09.090
<v Speaker 2>He tells his people at the fucking.</v>

473
00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:10.440
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

474
00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:12.090
<v Speaker 2>he's works for the EPA,</v>

475
00:14:12.091 --> 00:14:13.860
<v Speaker 2>the highest paid climate expert.</v>

476
00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:14.731
<v Speaker 2>And they go,</v>

477
00:14:14.731 --> 00:14:14.851
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

478
00:14:14.851 --> 00:14:16.290
<v Speaker 2>we want you to do a lot of studies on climate change.</v>

479
00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:16.440
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

480
00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:16.860
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

481
00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:21.840
<v Speaker 2>I would love to work for the CIA is a protecting America.</v>

482
00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:22.410
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile,</v>

483
00:14:22.410 --> 00:14:23.280
<v Speaker 2>he was just making it up,</v>

484
00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:25.620
<v Speaker 2>but he did it for the longest time,</v>

485
00:14:25.650 --> 00:14:28.410
<v Speaker 2>like this guy built them out of a million dollars over a decade.</v>

486
00:14:28.650 --> 00:14:29.820
<v Speaker 2>I say more power to them.</v>

487
00:14:29.821 --> 00:14:33.260
<v Speaker 2>There's a drift in the system and use it again.</v>

488
00:14:33.270 --> 00:14:36.500
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's more than competence than it is anything.</v>

489
00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:39.090
<v Speaker 2>It's more human horesh behavior.</v>

490
00:14:39.210 --> 00:14:42.510
<v Speaker 2>It's greed than it is for example.</v>

491
00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:44.400
<v Speaker 2>But I have to work for the CIA.</v>

492
00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:45.360
<v Speaker 2>What can I tell you?</v>

493
00:14:45.890 --> 00:14:46.723
<v Speaker 2>My hands are tied.</v>

494
00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:51.380
<v Speaker 2>You have to just invent that you're a CIA operative.</v>

495
00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:52.440
<v Speaker 2>How many fakes</v>

496
00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:56.010
<v Speaker 4>I operators out there like dudes are trying to impress chicks and it's amazing.</v>

497
00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:57.050
<v Speaker 4>Especially with homeland,</v>

498
00:14:57.051 --> 00:14:58.220
<v Speaker 4>it's probably jumped up quite a bit.</v>

499
00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:00.230
<v Speaker 4>Can you prove to us that you're seeing.</v>

500
00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:01.370
<v Speaker 4>I would love to,</v>

501
00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:02.450
<v Speaker 4>but it's top secret.</v>

502
00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:05.870
<v Speaker 4>Have you would have to be sequestered and that's the thing.</v>

503
00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:06.311
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>

504
00:15:06.311 --> 00:15:07.144
<v Speaker 4>I can't.</v>

505
00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:07.940
<v Speaker 4>I'm working for the.</v>

506
00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:09.500
<v Speaker 4>I'm trying to save America.</v>

507
00:15:11.050 --> 00:15:13.490
<v Speaker 4>I know it looks like I'm on facebook 23 hours a day.</v>

508
00:15:13.491 --> 00:15:14.300
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>

509
00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:14.481
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

510
00:15:14.481 --> 00:15:16.550
<v Speaker 4>they checked his cell phone like texting,</v>

511
00:15:16.551 --> 00:15:17.540
<v Speaker 4>like 20 different chicks.</v>

512
00:15:17.541 --> 00:15:18.261
<v Speaker 4>What's going on man?</v>

513
00:15:18.261 --> 00:15:20.000
<v Speaker 4>You weren't really working on climate change.</v>

514
00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:21.680
<v Speaker 4>It was just getting mad cash.</v>

515
00:15:21.681 --> 00:15:25.600
<v Speaker 4>Just bawling every night going strip clubs for all parties at the house.</v>

516
00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:26.351
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

517
00:15:26.351 --> 00:15:27.380
<v Speaker 4>it's a lot of you porn,</v>

518
00:15:27.381 --> 00:15:30.200
<v Speaker 4>but you point is actually a front for a CIA website.</v>

519
00:15:30.201 --> 00:15:33.180
<v Speaker 4>So making sure that the really dark stuff doesn't.</v>

520
00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:34.760
<v Speaker 4>I watched the,</v>

521
00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:35.270
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

522
00:15:35.270 --> 00:15:35.640
<v Speaker 4>the ain't no.</v>

523
00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:37.070
<v Speaker 4>We have to allow a certain amount.</v>

524
00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:38.900
<v Speaker 4>I am horrified by the gaping.</v>

525
00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:41.180
<v Speaker 4>We have to allow a certain amount.</v>

526
00:15:41.181 --> 00:15:42.110
<v Speaker 4>If we don't allow it,</v>

527
00:15:42.370 --> 00:15:45.260
<v Speaker 4>then we're gonna lose a lot of the people that would be with us against this</v>

528
00:15:45.261 --> 00:15:45.520
<v Speaker 4>child.</v>

529
00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:49.700
<v Speaker 4>My job to measure the diameter of the gate because if it gets beyond a certain</v>

530
00:15:49.701 --> 00:15:50.510
<v Speaker 4>point,</v>

531
00:15:50.510 --> 00:15:52.790
<v Speaker 4>if we start getting officers like we gotta cancel the program,</v>

532
00:15:54.570 --> 00:15:55.680
<v Speaker 4>they've seen some of the,</v>

533
00:15:56.220 --> 00:15:56.541
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>

534
00:15:56.541 --> 00:15:59.480
<v Speaker 4>think of the size of an ostrich egg and that's nothing compared the size of some</v>

535
00:15:59.481 --> 00:16:00.314
<v Speaker 4>of these people's butts.</v>

536
00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:03.560
<v Speaker 4>You know that they like least stretch them out in these videos.</v>

537
00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:05.810
<v Speaker 4>Have you been to IFEC Joe Website?</v>

538
00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:06.500
<v Speaker 4>He fucked.</v>

539
00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:06.880
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

540
00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:08.480
<v Speaker 4>it was all just really horrible shit.</v>

541
00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:09.081
<v Speaker 4>It's like that.</v>

542
00:16:09.081 --> 00:16:10.460
<v Speaker 4>It's like so many pink socks,</v>

543
00:16:10.461 --> 00:16:12.950
<v Speaker 4>like people getting stocks coming out,</v>

544
00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:14.390
<v Speaker 4>girls pooping while having sex.</v>

545
00:16:14.450 --> 00:16:14.970
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

546
00:16:14.970 --> 00:16:17.720
<v Speaker 4>that's the weird thing is not just that that exists,</v>

547
00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:21.680
<v Speaker 4>it's that we kind of are not even a little bit surprised at that exists because</v>

548
00:16:21.681 --> 00:16:25.430
<v Speaker 4>we all know that the natural tendency of human beings is to escalate.</v>

549
00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:27.800
<v Speaker 4>We just escalate and if a guy can put it in,</v>

550
00:16:27.801 --> 00:16:28.910
<v Speaker 4>your mouth is going to go.</v>

551
00:16:28.911 --> 00:16:29.320
<v Speaker 4>What about your,</v>

552
00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:31.610
<v Speaker 4>but just even know why he wants to do it.</v>

553
00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:33.440
<v Speaker 4>What other holes do you have to offer?</v>

554
00:16:33.441 --> 00:16:34.430
<v Speaker 4>I mean when,</v>

555
00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:35.390
<v Speaker 4>when people are,</v>

556
00:16:35.391 --> 00:16:36.224
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

557
00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:37.090
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

558
00:16:37.090 --> 00:16:39.740
<v Speaker 4>obsessed with anything,</v>

559
00:16:39.741 --> 00:16:42.360
<v Speaker 4>whether it's sex or technology or whatever,</v>

560
00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:43.263
<v Speaker 4>whatever it is,</v>

561
00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:46.280
<v Speaker 4>you're going to try to take that thing to the highest level.</v>

562
00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:47.420
<v Speaker 4>Like they're making a mustang.</v>

563
00:16:47.421 --> 00:16:49.880
<v Speaker 4>Now there's a mustang you could buy from the factory.</v>

564
00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:52.160
<v Speaker 4>It's 670 horsepower.</v>

565
00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:54.170
<v Speaker 4>That's ridiculous.</v>

566
00:16:54.530 --> 00:16:56.030
<v Speaker 4>That's absolutely insane.</v>

567
00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:57.260
<v Speaker 4>It's a shelby gt,</v>

568
00:16:57.261 --> 00:16:57.741
<v Speaker 4>500.</v>

569
00:16:57.741 --> 00:16:59.970
<v Speaker 4>It's got like 668 something horses.</v>

570
00:16:59.971 --> 00:17:00.681
<v Speaker 4>Where do you use that?</v>

571
00:17:00.681 --> 00:17:03.110
<v Speaker 4>Just the salt flats on the salt flats.</v>

572
00:17:03.111 --> 00:17:04.100
<v Speaker 4>It goes 200 miles an hour.</v>

573
00:17:04.101 --> 00:17:04.851
<v Speaker 4>It's a mustang.</v>

574
00:17:04.851 --> 00:17:08.330
<v Speaker 4>It's one of the craziest things that anyone's ever offered for sale because it</v>

575
00:17:08.331 --> 00:17:09.320
<v Speaker 4>doesn't even handle good.</v>

576
00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:10.910
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's really like an old muscle car.</v>

577
00:17:10.910 --> 00:17:12.620
<v Speaker 4>It has something called a live axle,</v>

578
00:17:12.950 --> 00:17:15.730
<v Speaker 4>which is essentially like a log that keeps your wheels on it.</v>

579
00:17:15.731 --> 00:17:17.570
<v Speaker 4>So just one big fat.</v>

580
00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:18.440
<v Speaker 4>They don't do that anymore.</v>

581
00:17:18.441 --> 00:17:21.020
<v Speaker 4>They do independent real suspension so that when you hit bumps,</v>

582
00:17:21.170 --> 00:17:22.160
<v Speaker 4>your car adjusts.</v>

583
00:17:22.161 --> 00:17:23.810
<v Speaker 4>Our tendency is to see how far it can go.</v>

584

00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:30.260
<v Speaker 4>100 nuclear bombs would destroy the planet and we've got like several thousand</v>

587
00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:31.400
<v Speaker 4>just in case.</v>

595
00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:40.580

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

620
00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:19.520

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:20.520
<v Speaker 4>I could see if.</v>

622
00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:22.340

624
00:18:24.571 --> 00:18:27.600
<v Speaker 4>like there's a lot of extra baggage or like room in there.</v>

625
00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:29.330
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's just like,</v>

628
00:18:33.211 --> 00:18:34.380
<v Speaker 4>I would imagine the vagina,</v>

<v Speaker 4>They vary in size.</v>

632
00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:39.640
<v Speaker 4>Just if I was married to a girl like that,</v>

633
00:18:39.641 --> 00:18:40.231
<v Speaker 4>I would get all right.</v>

639
00:18:57.310 --> 00:18:58.250
<v Speaker 4>if you're saying it to hurt,</v>

640
00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:00.030
<v Speaker 4>you tend to be somebody who you're not to.</v>

641
00:19:00.031 --> 00:19:00.331
<v Speaker 4>To her,</v>

<v Speaker 5>a Saturday and instead it went up online and viral and all that shit.</v>

00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:08.170
<v Speaker 4>She's showing everything but her vagina.</v>

719
00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:12.540
<v Speaker 4>I mean her knee is just strategically blocking her labia.</v>

720
00:21:12.790 --> 00:21:15.820
<v Speaker 4>Her legs are wide open and she's hot as fuck.</v>

721
00:21:15.850 --> 00:21:16.421
<v Speaker 4>Now here's the thing.</v>

722
00:21:16.421 --> 00:21:19.690
<v Speaker 4>If you put the Kyron right in front of the vagina,</v>

723
00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:21.250
<v Speaker 4>then everybody would know the news.</v>

724
00:21:21.370 --> 00:21:22.203
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

725
00:21:22.450 --> 00:21:26.020
<v Speaker 4>We'd be a very informed country and women would get angry at you if you knew the</v>

726
00:21:26.021 --> 00:21:26.450
<v Speaker 4>news.</v>

727
00:21:26.450 --> 00:21:26.650
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

728
00:21:26.650 --> 00:21:28.960
<v Speaker 4>you were looking at her vagina and you read the fucking news.</v>

729
00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:29.793
<v Speaker 4>Huh?</v>

730
00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:30.550
<v Speaker 4>Like she,</v>

731
00:21:30.550 --> 00:21:30.790
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

732
00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:32.830
<v Speaker 4>it's just weird that they get to dress like that.</v>

733
00:21:32.831 --> 00:21:36.910
<v Speaker 4>Like she's completely wearing come fuck me pumps back that up again.</v>

734
00:21:36.911 --> 00:21:37.121
<v Speaker 4>Let's,</v>

735
00:21:37.121 --> 00:21:38.410
<v Speaker 4>let's dissect this.</v>

736
00:21:38.620 --> 00:21:40.210
<v Speaker 4>Look at her like her shoes.</v>

737
00:21:40.510 --> 00:21:41.111
<v Speaker 4>Those are like,</v>

738
00:21:41.111 --> 00:21:42.910
<v Speaker 4>I want to go out and get sexy shoes.</v>

739
00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:45.820
<v Speaker 4>There's a not comfortable by any stretch of the imagination.</v>

740
00:21:45.970 --> 00:21:47.410
<v Speaker 4>They show most of your foot.</v>

741
00:21:47.710 --> 00:21:47.980
<v Speaker 4>Her,</v>

742
00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:50.040
<v Speaker 4>almost her entire legs are exposed.</v>

743
00:21:50.490 --> 00:21:52.360
<v Speaker 4>Mean you imagine if a guy was sitting there like that.</v>

744
00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:56.140
<v Speaker 4>You know how bizarre that would be if there was a show where a guy was sitting</v>

745
00:21:56.141 --> 00:21:57.190
<v Speaker 4>there in a tiny,</v>

746
00:21:57.191 --> 00:21:59.970
<v Speaker 4>tiny kilt and you know that you could,</v>

747
00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:02.710
<v Speaker 4>if he moves his left knee an inch to the right,</v>

748
00:22:02.711 --> 00:22:04.540
<v Speaker 4>you're going to see his cock for sure.</v>

749
00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:05.390
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

750
00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:08.890
<v Speaker 4>and they also have like an ejection button that slings them into the</v>

751
00:22:08.891 --> 00:22:09.671
<v Speaker 4>stratosphere at once.</v>

752
00:22:09.671 --> 00:22:10.570
<v Speaker 4>They hit 35,</v>

753
00:22:10.850 --> 00:22:12.700
<v Speaker 4>but you hit an age in an age limit.</v>

754
00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:14.620
<v Speaker 4>They disappeared on poor girls.</v>

755
00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:15.640
<v Speaker 4>That's a fixed.</v>

756
00:22:15.641 --> 00:22:17.050
<v Speaker 4>You had some kind of irritation down there.</v>

757
00:22:17.051 --> 00:22:17.310
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>

758
00:22:17.310 --> 00:22:19.840
<v Speaker 4>Well I think Sarah Pailin brought the DM MILF back.</v>

759
00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:22.090
<v Speaker 4>So maybe,</v>

760
00:22:22.091 --> 00:22:22.410
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

761
00:22:22.410 --> 00:22:24.250
<v Speaker 4>maybe we'll move in that direction,</v>

762
00:22:24.850 --> 00:22:26.050
<v Speaker 4>but I don't think she actually brought it back.</v>

763
00:22:26.051 --> 00:22:27.010
<v Speaker 4>She brought it back for a little bit.</v>

764
00:22:27.011 --> 00:22:27.611
<v Speaker 4>But now people are,</v>

765
00:22:27.611 --> 00:22:28.040
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

766
00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:29.430
<v Speaker 4>you say too much crazy shit.</v>

767
00:22:29.530 --> 00:22:30.363
<v Speaker 4>Guilt,</v>

768
00:22:30.460 --> 00:22:30.820
<v Speaker 4>guilt.</v>

769
00:22:30.820 --> 00:22:31.740
<v Speaker 4>You forgetting the grandma.</v>

770
00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:33.013
<v Speaker 4>She's a qrf.</v>

771
00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:35.450
<v Speaker 4>You don't want to say that though because it'll fuck with you.</v>

772
00:22:35.451 --> 00:22:35.651
<v Speaker 4>Dig.</v>

773
00:22:35.651 --> 00:22:36.484
<v Speaker 4>It's creepy.</v>

774
00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:37.030
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

775
00:22:37.030 --> 00:22:37.810
<v Speaker 4>Is Okay.</v>

776
00:22:37.810 --> 00:22:39.910
<v Speaker 4>But not so much.</v>

777
00:22:40.510 --> 00:22:45.510
<v Speaker 4>It's just weird that we have these odd standards of sexual attire in the</v>

778
00:22:45.521 --> 00:22:48.550
<v Speaker 4>workplace and not just in the workplace but on television,</v>

779
00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:49.660
<v Speaker 4>like on television,</v>

780
00:22:49.661 --> 00:22:54.661
<v Speaker 4>promoting this strange propaganda machine and just really hot girls with their</v>

781
00:22:55.301 --> 00:22:55.811
<v Speaker 4>vaginas.</v>

782
00:22:55.811 --> 00:22:58.330
<v Speaker 4>Hanging out with explosions and hot girls.</v>

783
00:22:58.331 --> 00:22:58.661
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

784
00:22:58.661 --> 00:23:02.620
<v Speaker 4>I can't pay attention to whatever the fuck she say when she see her thighs.</v>

785
00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:03.513
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>

786
00:23:03.810 --> 00:23:05.150
<v Speaker 4>If I see that girl go,</v>

787
00:23:05.250 --> 00:23:05.650
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>

788
00:23:05.650 --> 00:23:06.550
<v Speaker 4>I wish she liked me.</v>

789
00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:08.831
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

790
00:23:08.831 --> 00:23:11.710
<v Speaker 4>Especially if you're lonely and you know,</v>

791
00:23:11.770 --> 00:23:12.880
<v Speaker 4>you're not married or anything.</v>

792
00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:13.530

794
00:23:14.021 --> 00:23:16.080
<v Speaker 4>That guy is like 12 times he size.</v>

795
00:23:16.150 --> 00:23:16.331
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

796
00:23:16.331 --> 00:23:17.650
<v Speaker 4>It's rob for its fat brother.</v>

799
00:23:21.890 --> 00:23:22.340
<v Speaker 4>skirt.</v>

00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:23.590
<v Speaker 4>It's totally enough score there.</v>

801
00:23:23.591 --> 00:23:25.270
<v Speaker 4>Panning from the vagina up.</v>

802
00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:27.640
<v Speaker 4>It's off center just slightly.</v>

803
00:23:27.970 --> 00:23:29.380
<v Speaker 4>He's trying to show off his two though.</v>

804
00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:30.310
<v Speaker 4>You gotta give him credit.</v>

<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

809
00:23:32.471 --> 00:23:33.460
<v Speaker 4>you've got to get a respect.</v>

810
00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:34.720
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't give.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Fuck.</v>

812
00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:37.810
<v Speaker 4>The only way I'm gonna get this one is if I let her know I don't give a fuck.</v>

813
00:23:38.050 --> 00:23:38.890
<v Speaker 4>Here's my gut.</v>

814
00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:40.500
<v Speaker 4>I'm not trying to cover myself up.</v>

815
00:23:40.501 --> 00:23:41.770
<v Speaker 4>I'm staying an extra straight.</v>

816
00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:43.090
<v Speaker 4>I'm spreading my legs wide.</v>

817
00:23:43.270 --> 00:23:43.601
<v Speaker 4>Look at that.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Don't give a fuck points.</v>

820
00:23:46.410 --> 00:23:47.540
<v Speaker 4>It might be a fat fuck,</v>

821
00:23:47.541 --> 00:23:47.970
<v Speaker 4>but I'll fight.</v>

822
00:23:47.970 --> 00:23:51.500
<v Speaker 4>You should add a fact because I like to live that good life.</v>

823
00:23:51.770 --> 00:23:52.603
<v Speaker 4>That's what he's saying.</v>

824
00:23:52.710 --> 00:23:55.400
<v Speaker 4>Like there's playlist of all the different ones.</v>

825
00:23:55.460 --> 00:23:56.990
<v Speaker 4>Was that one the one that you just showed?</v>

826
00:23:57.750 --> 00:23:58.401
<v Speaker 4>That's a Fox.</v>

827
00:23:58.401 --> 00:23:59.270
<v Speaker 4>Went to the redhead.</v>

828
00:23:59.690 --> 00:23:59.871
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

829
00:23:59.871 --> 00:24:00.351
<v Speaker 4>it's crazy.</v>

830
00:24:00.351 --> 00:24:00.681
<v Speaker 4>That one.</v>

831
00:24:00.681 --> 00:24:01.371
<v Speaker 4>The blonde.</v>

832
00:24:01.371 --> 00:24:02.204
<v Speaker 4>That was screens.</v>

833
00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:03.320
<v Speaker 4>I know who she is.</v>

834
00:24:03.321 --> 00:24:03.830
<v Speaker 4>That's the one.</v>

835
00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:05.750
<v Speaker 4>She's been on these things before.</v>

836
00:24:05.810 --> 00:24:06.680
<v Speaker 4>They're all hot though.</v>

837
00:24:06.890 --> 00:24:07.670
<v Speaker 4>They're beautiful.</v>

838
00:24:07.670 --> 00:24:08.503
<v Speaker 4>It's weird,</v>

839
00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:10.490
<v Speaker 4>but it's just such a dirty trick.</v>

840
00:24:10.870 --> 00:24:11.410
<v Speaker 4>One.</v>

841
00:24:11.410 --> 00:24:12.243
<v Speaker 4>I'm not,</v>

842
00:24:12.290 --> 00:24:17.290
<v Speaker 4>especially like if you're married and you know when you're trying to be</v>

843
00:24:17.631 --> 00:24:18.464
<v Speaker 4>monogamous,</v>

844
00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:23.510
<v Speaker 4>you're going to look at sex in a different way because you look at like a girl</v>

845
00:24:23.511 --> 00:24:24.141
<v Speaker 4>that's like super,</v>

846
00:24:24.141 --> 00:24:25.310
<v Speaker 4>super hot and you go,</v>

847
00:24:25.370 --> 00:24:26.390
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

848
00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:27.620
<v Speaker 4>I could never get that.</v>

849
00:24:28.670 --> 00:24:29.540
<v Speaker 4>If you're single,</v>

850
00:24:29.730 --> 00:24:30.800
<v Speaker 4>if you're delusional,</v>

851
00:24:30.801 --> 00:24:31.311
<v Speaker 4>you'd be like,</v>

852
00:24:31.311 --> 00:24:31.611
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

853
00:24:31.611 --> 00:24:34.160
<v Speaker 4>if I just ran into her at the right place right time,</v>

854
00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:35.173
<v Speaker 4>maybe this could happen.</v>

855
00:24:35.270 --> 00:24:36.290
<v Speaker 4>So it's a different thing.</v>

856
00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:37.130
<v Speaker 4>So it's the.</v>

857
00:24:37.130 --> 00:24:38.000
<v Speaker 4>There's a wistful,</v>

858
00:24:38.001 --> 00:24:38.930
<v Speaker 4>almost romantic way.</v>

859
00:24:38.931 --> 00:24:40.550
<v Speaker 4>You look at the Fox News girls if you're married</v>

860
00:24:40.630 --> 00:24:40.901
<v Speaker 5>on the,</v>

861
00:24:40.901 --> 00:24:42.220
<v Speaker 5>on the on the same note.</v>

862
00:24:42.221 --> 00:24:45.430
<v Speaker 5>It's like when I went out when a hot celebrity like gets divorced,</v>

863
00:24:45.431 --> 00:24:47.940
<v Speaker 5>there's something inside the most loser of guys.</v>

864
00:24:47.941 --> 00:24:49.060
<v Speaker 5>It's like now I got a shot.</v>

865
00:24:49.390 --> 00:24:49.940
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

866
00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:50.280
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

867
00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:52.180
<v Speaker 5>like Angelina Jolie gets divorced and people are like,</v>

868
00:24:52.181 --> 00:24:52.730
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>

869
00:24:52.730 --> 00:24:53.990
<v Speaker 4>They think all I gotta do.</v>

870
00:24:54.750 --> 00:24:55.340
<v Speaker 4>I'm just,</v>

871
00:24:55.340 --> 00:24:57.620
<v Speaker 4>their guys are so fucking delusional.</v>

872
00:24:57.830 --> 00:25:00.320
<v Speaker 4>They feel like all they gotta do is be at the right place,</v>

873
00:25:00.321 --> 00:25:00.981
<v Speaker 4>the right time.</v>

874
00:25:00.981 --> 00:25:01.161
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

875
00:25:01.161 --> 00:25:04.910
<v Speaker 4>maybe she goes to the car shop because your wipers broken and she wants to try</v>

876
00:25:04.911 --> 00:25:05.721
<v Speaker 4>to fix it herself.</v>

877
00:25:05.721 --> 00:25:06.554
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

878
00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:10.530
<v Speaker 4>I get to impress her by my knowledge of windshield wipers and she realized I'm</v>

879
00:25:10.630 --> 00:25:12.510
<v Speaker 4>just a regular guy and sometimes girls will.</v>

880
00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:13.423
<v Speaker 4>Jesus Christ.</v>

881
00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:14.090
<v Speaker 4>Look at this.</v>

882
00:25:14.090 --> 00:25:15.440
<v Speaker 4>She actually pulls her skirt up.</v>

883
00:25:15.441 --> 00:25:15.980
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>

884
00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:16.370
<v Speaker 4>Bam.</v>

885
00:25:16.370 --> 00:25:16.610
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

886
00:25:16.610 --> 00:25:17.443
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

887
00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:19.030
<v Speaker 4>pulling it up.</v>

888
00:25:19.050 --> 00:25:19.970
<v Speaker 4>How dare you,</v>

889
00:25:19.971 --> 00:25:20.870
<v Speaker 4>you dirty bitch.</v>

890
00:25:20.930 --> 00:25:21.763
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God,</v>

891
00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:23.270
<v Speaker 4>look how she sits.</v>

892
00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:27.140
<v Speaker 4>It's perfect posture.</v>

893
00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:29.230
<v Speaker 5>It's kind of like going back to when you were like really young,</v>

894
00:25:29.231 --> 00:25:32.080
<v Speaker 5>looking at like jc penny's lingerie catalogs,</v>

895
00:25:32.081 --> 00:25:35.860
<v Speaker 5>like when we're tense and you wonder why people that Watch Fox News are idiots.</v>

896
00:25:35.890 --> 00:25:36.430
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

897
00:25:36.430 --> 00:25:37.850
<v Speaker 5>not that a lot of networks aren't,</v>

898
00:25:37.870 --> 00:25:38.471
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>

899
00:25:38.471 --> 00:25:40.390
<v Speaker 5>they did that study that people have watched Fox News.</v>

900
00:25:40.391 --> 00:25:41.570
<v Speaker 5>No less about what's happening in the world.</v>

901
00:25:41.580 --> 00:25:42.880
<v Speaker 5>The people watching no news at all.</v>

902
00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:43.630
<v Speaker 5>I believe that.</v>

903
00:25:43.630 --> 00:25:44.270
<v Speaker 5>I love that.</v>

904
00:25:44.270 --> 00:25:45.103
<v Speaker 4>That makes sense.</v>

905
00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:45.970
<v Speaker 4>It'd be all.</v>

906
00:25:45.970 --> 00:25:46.191
<v Speaker 4>You're gonna,</v>

907
00:25:46.191 --> 00:25:46.431
<v Speaker 4>you're gonna.</v>

908
00:25:46.431 --> 00:25:48.050
<v Speaker 4>Find out about captain Kirk's love life.</v>

909
00:25:49.190 --> 00:25:50.280
<v Speaker 4>So these are two regular guys.</v>

910
00:25:50.281 --> 00:25:51.114
<v Speaker 4>Is ABC,</v>

911
00:25:51.380 --> 00:25:52.520
<v Speaker 4>ABC as regular girls.</v>

912
00:25:52.850 --> 00:25:55.850
<v Speaker 4>ABC is more probably geared towards women that don't want to be threatened</v>

913
00:25:58.770 --> 00:25:59.690
<v Speaker 4>in the background.</v>

914
00:25:59.860 --> 00:26:02.840
<v Speaker 4>He's never seen this video to be naked.</v>

915
00:26:03.230 --> 00:26:03.490
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

916
00:26:03.490 --> 00:26:05.270
<v Speaker 4>it's just hammered in the shorts.</v>

917
00:26:06.410 --> 00:26:07.011
<v Speaker 4>Well Christy,</v>

<v Speaker 4>they are the whole neighborhood knows the boy jumped out of a fucking second</v>

919
00:26:11.811 --> 00:26:13.060
<v Speaker 4>story window and fell.</v>

920
00:26:14.990 --> 00:26:15.561
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>

921
00:26:15.561 --> 00:26:16.394
<v Speaker 4>That's funny.</v>

922
00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:17.900
<v Speaker 4>That's funny.</v>

923
00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:18.081
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

924
00:26:18.081 --> 00:26:19.820
<v Speaker 4>If you leave the fucking camera on long enough,</v>

925
00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:21.500
<v Speaker 4>people catch the craziest shit ever.</v>

926
00:26:21.770 --> 00:26:22.670
<v Speaker 4>Did you see any of the,</v>

927
00:26:22.690 --> 00:26:27.410
<v Speaker 4>like the snow storm driving footage son you got jacked?</v>

928
00:26:28.370 --> 00:26:29.203
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

929
00:26:29.790 --> 00:26:30.500
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

930
00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:34.610
<v Speaker 4>Snow storms all throughout the country that been getting these nutty snow and</v>

931
00:26:34.611 --> 00:26:35.444
<v Speaker 4>ice storms.</v>

932
00:26:36.620 --> 00:26:37.340
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

933
00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:38.173
<v Speaker 4>What is that man?</v>

934
00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:38.570
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

935
00:26:38.570 --> 00:26:39.300
<v Speaker 4>it should be.</v>

936
00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:40.280
<v Speaker 4>It's unfair.</v>

937
00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:40.521
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

938
00:26:40.521 --> 00:26:42.620
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to say that pretty girls shouldn't be able to get a job.</v>

939
00:26:42.890 --> 00:26:43.723
<v Speaker 4>They should,</v>

940
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:47.490
<v Speaker 6>but it shouldn't be exclusively pretty girls telling you about important shit</v>

941
00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:48.900
<v Speaker 6>week to week.</v>

942
00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:50.400
<v Speaker 2>We're not paying attention to the message.</v>

943
00:26:50.430 --> 00:26:50.640
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

944
00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:51.473
<v Speaker 2>not at all.</v>

945
00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:52.321
<v Speaker 2>But that's the thing.</v>

946
00:26:52.321 --> 00:26:53.970
<v Speaker 2>If you see an ugly girl on the news,</v>

947
00:26:53.971 --> 00:26:54.560
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

948
00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:55.800
<v Speaker 2>that girl knows her shit.</v>

949
00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:56.241
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

950
00:26:56.241 --> 00:26:57.780
<v Speaker 2>She fought her way to the top.</v>

951
00:26:57.900 --> 00:26:59.420
<v Speaker 6>There's just something about,</v>

952
00:26:59.570 --> 00:27:00.320
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

953
00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:00.561
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

954
00:27:00.561 --> 00:27:00.770
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

955
00:27:00.770 --> 00:27:01.031
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

956
00:27:01.031 --> 00:27:01.500
<v Speaker 6>like I said,</v>

957
00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:04.760
<v Speaker 6>like those Fox News women that like the one you were talking about before the</v>

958
00:27:04.761 --> 00:27:08.510
<v Speaker 6>show started who argued with someone about Santa Claus being white.</v>

959
00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:09.530
<v Speaker 2>Meghan Kelly.</v>

960
00:27:09.531 --> 00:27:13.220
<v Speaker 2>Apparently said very authoritatively that Santa Claus is white.</v>

961
00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:13.840
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

962
00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:14.980
<v Speaker 6>she's very authoritative.</v>

963
00:27:14.981 --> 00:27:15.814
<v Speaker 6>Always.</v>

964
00:27:15.850 --> 00:27:17.200
<v Speaker 6>A lot of those gals are.</v>

965
00:27:17.230 --> 00:27:19.780
<v Speaker 6>But there's something like four Beta men,</v>

966
00:27:19.810 --> 00:27:22.930
<v Speaker 6>especially for men that are weak and beaten down by life.</v>

967
00:27:23.230 --> 00:27:26.410
<v Speaker 6>The ultimate fantasy is that this woman accepts you.</v>

968
00:27:26.740 --> 00:27:29.500
<v Speaker 6>The ultimate fantasy is that she's impressed by you and accept you because she's</v>

969
00:27:29.501 --> 00:27:30.370
<v Speaker 6>so hard ass.</v>

970
00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:31.900
<v Speaker 6>She's so obviously beautiful,</v>

971
00:27:31.901 --> 00:27:34.150
<v Speaker 6>but also so hard ass that there's this,</v>

972
00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:35.231
<v Speaker 6>there's this,</v>

973
00:27:35.231 --> 00:27:35.770
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

974
00:27:35.770 --> 00:27:36.131
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

975
00:27:36.131 --> 00:27:36.880
<v Speaker 6>when she's around you,</v>

976
00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:38.860
<v Speaker 6>you want to like mark obamacare.</v>

977
00:27:39.150 --> 00:27:40.740
<v Speaker 6>You want to just start making fun of it like you.</v>

978
00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:42.910
<v Speaker 2>He'll write specific just to make her happy.</v>

979
00:27:43.270 --> 00:27:43.780
<v Speaker 2>Girls.</v>

980
00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:44.081
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

00:27:44.081 --> 00:27:44.870

982
00:27:44.870 --> 00:27:47.320
<v Speaker 2>get in to get in and just talk to her.</v>

983
00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:48.740
<v Speaker 2>He asked white had.</v>

984
00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:49.613
<v Speaker 2>Goddamn righty.</v>

985
00:27:50.020 --> 00:27:50.853
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

986
00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:52.380
<v Speaker 6>Show me one picture with Santa.</v>

987
00:27:52.381 --> 00:27:52.860
<v Speaker 6>It's black.</v>

988
00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:54.280
<v Speaker 6>It wasn't drawn by a black guy.</v>

989
00:27:55.170 --> 00:27:56.040
<v Speaker 6>So yeah,</v>

990
00:27:56.110 --> 00:27:58.410
<v Speaker 6>we were saying the sand is probably Siberian prolix.</v>

991
00:27:58.420 --> 00:27:59.253
<v Speaker 6>Chinese</v>

992
00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:01.920
<v Speaker 2>Greenpeace just put out a video of Santa,</v>

993
00:28:01.930 --> 00:28:04.180
<v Speaker 2>like in a melting height.</v>

994
00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:05.230
<v Speaker 2>And the point is that,</v>

995
00:28:05.410 --> 00:28:08.470
<v Speaker 2>and he's saying how the Arctic is melting or whatever.</v>

996
00:28:09.010 --> 00:28:10.150
<v Speaker 2>And it's pretty creepy video.</v>

997
00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:11.111
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

998
00:28:11.111 --> 00:28:11.920
<v Speaker 2>it is know,</v>

999
00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:14.470
<v Speaker 2>but it's also so hard.</v>

1000
00:28:14.471 --> 00:28:15.041
<v Speaker 2>Let's face it,</v>

1001
00:28:15.041 --> 00:28:16.360
<v Speaker 2>he's gonna fall through the ice before the.</v>

1002
00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:18.040
<v Speaker 2>A little extra weight.</v>

1003
00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:19.410
<v Speaker 6>It's so fought hard,</v>

1004
00:28:19.470 --> 00:28:23.970
<v Speaker 6>fought hard to fucking figure out when when it comes to climate and climate</v>

1005
00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:24.893
<v Speaker 6>change,</v>

1006
00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:29.820
<v Speaker 6>it's hard to figure out why people have this weird need to be on a team one side</v>

1007
00:28:29.821 --> 00:28:32.880
<v Speaker 6>of the other and now they have this weird name.</v>

1008
00:28:33.180 --> 00:28:34.013
<v Speaker 6>I was in an</v>

1009
00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:39.240
<v Speaker 6>exercise class and someone brought up just out of nowhere,</v>

1010
00:28:39.420 --> 00:28:43.500
<v Speaker 6>some guy brought up climate change and this young guy who's,</v>

1011
00:28:43.510 --> 00:28:43.700
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1012
00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:45.120
<v Speaker 6>could have been 1:25 years old,</v>

1013
00:28:45.420 --> 00:28:46.253
<v Speaker 6>starts going.</v>

1014
00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:48.870
<v Speaker 6>Climate change as always happened.</v>

1015
00:28:48.871 --> 00:28:50.280
<v Speaker 6>It's a part of life.</v>

1016
00:28:50.281 --> 00:28:52.380
<v Speaker 6>It's a part of the cycle of earth.</v>

1017
00:28:52.410 --> 00:28:54.030
<v Speaker 6>It's always gotten warm and always gotten cooler.</v>

1018
00:28:54.170 --> 00:28:54.540
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1019
00:28:54.540 --> 00:28:55.800
<v Speaker 2>Over a million years.</v>

1020
00:28:56.020 --> 00:28:56.220
<v Speaker 2>Never.</v>

1021
00:28:56.220 --> 00:28:56.970
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

1022
00:28:56.970 --> 00:28:59.220
<v Speaker 2>Every other time it's happened over a million years.</v>

1023
00:28:59.221 --> 00:29:00.150
<v Speaker 2>Now it's 100,</v>

1024
00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:01.673
<v Speaker 2>but it's also like,</v>

1025
00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:03.270
<v Speaker 2>how much research have you done?</v>

1026
00:29:04.710 --> 00:29:05.400
<v Speaker 2>He was there,</v>

1027
00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:06.000
<v Speaker 2>he was there,</v>

1028
00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:07.380
<v Speaker 2>he wasn't what he was saying.</v>

1029
00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:12.420
<v Speaker 2>What he was doing is just like going against liberal ideology right away.</v>

1030
00:29:12.450 --> 00:29:13.520
<v Speaker 2>I'm on team B team</v>

1031
00:29:13.750 --> 00:29:14.583
<v Speaker 6>business,</v>

1032
00:29:14.590 --> 00:29:14.921
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1033
00:29:14.921 --> 00:29:15.340
<v Speaker 6>I'm a.</v>

1034
00:29:15.340 --> 00:29:19.990
<v Speaker 6>I'm a no nonsense business sort of a guy and it's just this need to be taken</v>

1035
00:29:19.991 --> 00:29:21.280
<v Speaker 6>seriously and so,</v>

1036
00:29:21.281 --> 00:29:21.491
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1037
00:29:21.491 --> 00:29:22.530
<v Speaker 6>he and I had this conversation.</v>

1038
00:29:22.540 --> 00:29:22.781
<v Speaker 6>I said,</v>

1039
00:29:22.781 --> 00:29:23.430
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

1040
00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:25.240
<v Speaker 6>it's absolutely changed throughout history.</v>

1041
00:29:25.270 --> 00:29:26.200
<v Speaker 6>It's without a doubt,</v>

1042
00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:30.260
<v Speaker 6>but it's also very possible and most likely that we're changing it right now and</v>

1043
00:29:30.261 --> 00:29:31.510
<v Speaker 6>even more rapidly than normal.</v>

1044
00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:32.680
<v Speaker 6>Something to be concerned with.</v>

1045
00:29:33.100 --> 00:29:35.320
<v Speaker 6>And like he had this look on his face like he can't have.</v>

1046
00:29:35.620 --> 00:29:36.880
<v Speaker 6>I was giving them both options.</v>

1047
00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:39.730
<v Speaker 6>I was given them the option to write and I was also saying,</v>

1048
00:29:39.810 --> 00:29:40.191
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1049
00:29:40.191 --> 00:29:40.620
<v Speaker 6>the climate,</v>

1050
00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:42.520
<v Speaker 6>a control site and you're giving it in an easy way.</v>

1051
00:29:42.530 --> 00:29:44.890
<v Speaker 6>Like this seems like we don't have to argue what do I.</v>

1052
00:29:44.891 --> 00:29:45.720
<v Speaker 6>don't give a fuck.</v>

1053
00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:47.440
<v Speaker 6>I have no invested interest or no,</v>

1054
00:29:47.470 --> 00:29:50.020
<v Speaker 6>no vested interest in being right about climate change.</v>

1055
00:29:50.021 --> 00:29:51.160
<v Speaker 6>I've done zero work in it.</v>

1056
00:29:51.580 --> 00:29:53.080
<v Speaker 6>If it was my chosen field,</v>

1057
00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:56.350
<v Speaker 6>then maybe perhaps my ego would be attached to climate change like Egypt.</v>

1058
00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:57.011
<v Speaker 6>But yeah,</v>

1059
00:29:57.011 --> 00:29:59.890
<v Speaker 6>he just snowed in Egypt for the first time at 100 and something years the other</v>

1060
00:29:59.891 --> 00:30:00.250
<v Speaker 6>day.</v>

1061
00:30:00.250 --> 00:30:00.670
<v Speaker 6>Snowden.</v>

1062
00:30:00.670 --> 00:30:01.500
<v Speaker 6>Cairo,</v>

1063
00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:01.801
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1064
00:30:01.801 --> 00:30:03.540
<v Speaker 2>I was in Illinois a month ago.</v>

1065
00:30:03.541 --> 00:30:06.890
<v Speaker 2>When they had the most tornadoes they've ever had in November or whatever it</v>

1066
00:30:06.891 --> 00:30:07.500
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>

1067
00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:09.000
<v Speaker 2>sitting under a bridge or one of those</v>

1068
00:30:09.310 --> 00:30:10.610
<v Speaker 6>going to Chicago in January.</v>

1069
00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:12.200
<v Speaker 6>It'll be.</v>

1070
00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:13.033
<v Speaker 6>That'll be fine.</v>

1071
00:30:14.630 --> 00:30:14.920
<v Speaker 6>Brian.</v>

1072
00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:16.610
<v Speaker 6>I got to get you to put that on the calendar.</v>

1073
00:30:16.611 --> 00:30:16.970
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

1074
00:30:16.970 --> 00:30:18.290
<v Speaker 6>That's the Chicago theater.</v>

1075
00:30:18.291 --> 00:30:23.291
<v Speaker 6>January 24th with a beautiful and talented Ari Shaffir who goes cold as fuck.</v>

1076
00:30:24.610 --> 00:30:24.971
<v Speaker 6>Fuck,</v>

1077
00:30:24.971 --> 00:30:25.211
<v Speaker 6>fuck,</v>

1078
00:30:25.211 --> 00:30:25.460
<v Speaker 6>fuck.</v>

1079
00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:26.293
<v Speaker 6>Fuck.</v>

1080
00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:29.090
<v Speaker 6>I heard rfcs moving back.</v>

1081
00:30:29.110 --> 00:30:29.210
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

1082
00:30:29.210 --> 00:30:31.070
<v Speaker 6>you have to do is just moved to New York.</v>

1083
00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:31.480
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1084
00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:32.930
<v Speaker 6>You get one winter there and you're like,</v>

1085
00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:33.141
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

1086
00:30:33.141 --> 00:30:34.940
<v Speaker 6>this is a place where I can go where I don't have to do this.</v>

1087
00:30:35.020 --> 00:30:36.040
<v Speaker 2>That was on a couple shows with them,</v>

1088
00:30:36.041 --> 00:30:37.030
<v Speaker 2>but I thought he was just visiting.</v>

1089
00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:37.411
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1090
00:30:37.411 --> 00:30:38.280
<v Speaker 6>he stayed there for awhile.</v>

1091
00:30:38.310 --> 00:30:39.540
<v Speaker 6>I think it helps comedy a lot.</v>

1092
00:30:39.541 --> 00:30:42.900
<v Speaker 6>He just decided that we needed a new environment needed to really mix it up.</v>

1093
00:30:43.730 --> 00:30:44.790
<v Speaker 6>So we got an apartment there.</v>

1094
00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:45.713
<v Speaker 6>80 five right now?</v>

1095
00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:46.650
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1096
00:30:46.650 --> 00:30:47.483
<v Speaker 6>In La,</v>

1097
00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:48.600
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1098
00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:50.010
<v Speaker 6>New York's fucking fantastic.</v>

1099
00:30:50.340 --> 00:30:51.173
<v Speaker 6>It's huge.</v>

1100
00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:52.230
<v Speaker 6>It's gigantic.</v>

1101
00:30:52.231 --> 00:30:56.370
<v Speaker 6>It's filled with all sorts of interesting stuff and it's more museums per capita</v>

1102
00:30:56.371 --> 00:30:58.340
<v Speaker 6>than any city in the country and it's a.</v>

1103
00:30:58.670 --> 00:31:00.840
<v Speaker 6>it's a thought hub for sure,</v>

1104
00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:03.840
<v Speaker 6>but it's also like you're also beat your brains out,</v>

1105
00:31:03.841 --> 00:31:05.820
<v Speaker 6>but being surrounded by people like that all the time,</v>

1106
00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:06.993
<v Speaker 6>just</v>

1107
00:31:07.910 --> 00:31:09.690
<v Speaker 6>don't necessarily think that's good for you.</v>

1108
00:31:10.050 --> 00:31:10.530
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1109
00:31:10.530 --> 00:31:11.190
<v Speaker 6>I like it.</v>

1110
00:31:11.190 --> 00:31:11.490
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1111
00:31:11.490 --> 00:31:12.240
<v Speaker 6>Some people love it.</v>

1112
00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:13.140
<v Speaker 6>My manager loves it.</v>

1113
00:31:13.190 --> 00:31:13.770
<v Speaker 6>He fucking,</v>

1114
00:31:13.770 --> 00:31:15.030
<v Speaker 6>he wouldn't live anywhere else.</v>

1115
00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:15.480
<v Speaker 6>It keeps.</v>

1116
00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:16.313
<v Speaker 6>Keeps me angry.</v>

1117
00:31:16.670 --> 00:31:16.871
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1118
00:31:16.871 --> 00:31:17.071
<v Speaker 6>He goes,</v>

1119
00:31:17.071 --> 00:31:18.150
<v Speaker 6>I love the energy of the city.</v>

1120
00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:18.993
<v Speaker 6>I'm like,</v>

1121
00:31:19.340 --> 00:31:19.710
<v Speaker 6>I just,</v>

1122
00:31:19.710 --> 00:31:20.820
<v Speaker 6>I want to be similar way here.</v>

1123
00:31:20.821 --> 00:31:25.380
<v Speaker 6>Like birds Chirp and I just see the wind blows gently through the trees.</v>

1124
00:31:25.410 --> 00:31:26.610
<v Speaker 6>I don't hear anybody talking.</v>

1125
00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:27.833
<v Speaker 6>That's what I need,</v>

1126
00:31:29.490 --> 00:31:32.370
<v Speaker 6>but I think there's just because of around such large numbers of people,</v>

1127
00:31:32.540 --> 00:31:34.230
<v Speaker 6>I want to have a balance of that.</v>

1128
00:31:34.231 --> 00:31:35.810
<v Speaker 6>Like with the UFC or the,</v>

1129
00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:36.230
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1130
00:31:36.230 --> 00:31:37.063
<v Speaker 6>doing comedy shows.</v>

1131
00:31:37.510 --> 00:31:38.280
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1132
00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:39.130
<v Speaker 6>Get all these people.</v>

1133
00:31:39.170 --> 00:31:40.980
<v Speaker 6>I want to balance that out with just some.</v>

1134
00:31:40.981 --> 00:31:41.850
<v Speaker 6>No people time</v>

1135
00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:42.230
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1136
00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:42.461
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

1137
00:31:42.461 --> 00:31:45.260
<v Speaker 2>your job is to watch people beat each other's heads and you don't need it on the</v>

1138
00:31:45.290 --> 00:31:48.000
<v Speaker 2>subway and the sidewalk.</v>

1139
00:31:48.310 --> 00:31:50.230
<v Speaker 6>Enjoy watching violence outside of my job.</v>

1140
00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:51.470
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1141
00:31:51.470 --> 00:31:51.911
<v Speaker 6>Well there's not.</v>

1142
00:31:51.911 --> 00:31:54.340
<v Speaker 6>I don't think it's any more violence in New York and there was no la now.</v>

1143
00:31:54.341 --> 00:31:55.450
<v Speaker 6>I just meant angry people.</v>

1144
00:31:55.750 --> 00:31:56.980
<v Speaker 6>I think in fact,</v>

1145
00:31:57.040 --> 00:32:00.280
<v Speaker 6>probably New York is more open minded,</v>

1146
00:32:00.580 --> 00:32:00.971
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1147
00:32:00.971 --> 00:32:03.400
<v Speaker 6>a lot of people don't think that they think of California as being the most open</v>

1148
00:32:03.401 --> 00:32:04.090
<v Speaker 6>minded,</v>

1149
00:32:04.090 --> 00:32:08.350
<v Speaker 6>but I think quite honestly that there's something that you miss when you were in</v>

1150
00:32:08.351 --> 00:32:09.160
<v Speaker 6>cars all the time.</v>

1151
00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:10.120
<v Speaker 6>You don't interact with people.</v>

1152
00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:10.481
<v Speaker 6>That's.</v>

1153
00:32:10.481 --> 00:32:11.060
<v Speaker 6>I think that's.</v>

1154
00:32:11.060 --> 00:32:11.841
<v Speaker 2>It's actually what it is.</v>

1155
00:32:11.841 --> 00:32:12.710
<v Speaker 2>I think that it,</v>

1156
00:32:12.711 --> 00:32:13.940
<v Speaker 2>unless you're truly rich,</v>

1157
00:32:13.941 --> 00:32:16.490
<v Speaker 2>rich in New York City and taking a cab everywhere you are,</v>

1158
00:32:16.610 --> 00:32:16.990
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

1159
00:32:16.990 --> 00:32:19.310
<v Speaker 2>you're interacting with every type of person all day long</v>

1160
00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:21.490
<v Speaker 6>and even if you are rich that you have to take a cab,</v>

1161
00:32:21.491 --> 00:32:23.290
<v Speaker 6>like maybe for that one brief moment,</v>

1162
00:32:23.530 --> 00:32:25.060
<v Speaker 6>you know you're in a different environment,</v>

1163
00:32:25.061 --> 00:32:26.380
<v Speaker 6>but you'd get out of the cab,</v>

1164
00:32:26.381 --> 00:32:29.110
<v Speaker 6>you're going to walk right and you're gonna walk for a block or two and it's</v>

1165
00:32:29.111 --> 00:32:31.210
<v Speaker 6>going to be a fucking billion people.</v>

1166
00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:33.430
<v Speaker 6>There's experiences like that where you're walking down New York,</v>

1167
00:32:33.700 --> 00:32:34.990
<v Speaker 6>you don't get that anywhere else.</v>

1168
00:32:35.490 --> 00:32:38.500
<v Speaker 6>It's not parking lot of the office to the house garage.</v>

1169
00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:39.620
<v Speaker 6>It's not like mall,</v>

1170
00:32:39.730 --> 00:32:41.360
<v Speaker 6>he didn't park your car in the mall,</v>

1171
00:32:41.361 --> 00:32:44.070
<v Speaker 6>you walk in holding hands like the other Dr Seuss families,</v>

1172
00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:49.460
<v Speaker 6>this fucking hordes of people walking up and down and it's weird people and</v>

1173
00:32:49.610 --> 00:32:52.320
<v Speaker 6>homeless people and you gotta step over bumps and you know,</v>

1174
00:32:52.321 --> 00:32:53.360
<v Speaker 6>you got to see everything.</v>

1175
00:32:53.390 --> 00:32:55.490
<v Speaker 6>You got to see the whole fucking broad spectrum.</v>

1176
00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:56.420
<v Speaker 6>Set it again.</v>

1177
00:32:56.420 --> 00:32:56.661
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1178
00:32:56.661 --> 00:32:58.430
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think la is very,</v>

1179
00:32:58.570 --> 00:33:00.470
<v Speaker 2>very kind of liberal or left wing,</v>

1180
00:33:00.471 --> 00:33:03.800
<v Speaker 2>but there's a lot of apathy because I feel like it's just too nice here.</v>

1181
00:33:03.830 --> 00:33:06.200
<v Speaker 2>It's just too nice and happy is definitely not enough.</v>

1182
00:33:06.210 --> 00:33:07.970
<v Speaker 2>Whether were cocky as fuck.</v>

1183
00:33:08.390 --> 00:33:09.350
<v Speaker 2>There's no seasons.</v>

1184
00:33:09.470 --> 00:33:09.621
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1185
00:33:09.621 --> 00:33:10.580
<v Speaker 2>They don't have to deal with weather.</v>

1186
00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:11.473
<v Speaker 2>Whether it's real,</v>

1187
00:33:11.570 --> 00:33:11.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1188
00:33:11.940 --> 00:33:14.860
<v Speaker 2>you need to know that you're on a planet to change all the time.</v>

1189
00:33:14.861 --> 00:33:16.880
<v Speaker 2>We didn't in the cold smacks in the face.</v>

1190
00:33:16.970 --> 00:33:17.091
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1191
00:33:17.091 --> 00:33:17.690
<v Speaker 2>We have like,</v>

1192
00:33:17.690 --> 00:33:20.270
<v Speaker 2>we found like an area of the game where we got to God code.</v>

1193
00:33:22.190 --> 00:33:23.023
<v Speaker 2>Come over here.</v>

1194
00:33:23.050 --> 00:33:23.871
<v Speaker 2>Oh God,</v>

1195
00:33:23.871 --> 00:33:24.381
<v Speaker 2>code over here.</v>

1196
00:33:24.381 --> 00:33:25.100
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't rain.</v>

1197
00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:25.401
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't.</v>

1198
00:33:25.401 --> 00:33:26.810
<v Speaker 2>Snow never gets cold.</v>

1199
00:33:27.020 --> 00:33:28.280
<v Speaker 2>The worst of the wears a Hoodie,</v>

1200
00:33:28.570 --> 00:33:30.470
<v Speaker 2>like that's the worst you have to wear here as a Hoodie.</v>

1201
00:33:30.710 --> 00:33:31.630
<v Speaker 2>He just hit abb,</v>

1202
00:33:31.730 --> 00:33:32.031
<v Speaker 2>left,</v>

1203
00:33:32.031 --> 00:33:32.181
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

1204
00:33:32.181 --> 00:33:32.361
<v Speaker 2>left,</v>

1205
00:33:32.361 --> 00:33:33.194
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1206
00:33:33.230 --> 00:33:34.160
<v Speaker 2>Nice weather forever.</v>

1207
00:33:34.190 --> 00:33:38.490
<v Speaker 2>It would do everybody a lot of good if it snowed here every year would</v>

1208
00:33:38.950 --> 00:33:41.660
<v Speaker 2>straightened a lot of fucking fucking crazy ice storm.</v>

1209
00:33:41.661 --> 00:33:42.770
<v Speaker 2>Tornado just once a year.</v>

1210
00:33:43.070 --> 00:33:44.260
<v Speaker 2>Just snowed</v>

1211
00:33:44.330 --> 00:33:47.840
<v Speaker 6>and God fucking cold and brained and just let you know that like,</v>

1212
00:33:47.841 --> 00:33:48.350
<v Speaker 6>look,</v>

1213
00:33:48.350 --> 00:33:48.630
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>

1214
00:33:48.630 --> 00:33:49.760
<v Speaker 6>you ain't shit bitch.</v>

1215
00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:54.350
<v Speaker 6>I think there's a reason why people that live on the actual coast itself,</v>

1216
00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:54.710
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

1217
00:33:54.710 --> 00:33:58.580
<v Speaker 6>have a more humble and more laid back sort of vibe to them.</v>

1218
00:33:58.760 --> 00:33:59.720
<v Speaker 6>Like beach towns.</v>

1219
00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:02.570
<v Speaker 6>Like if you go to Huntington or Venice or Santa Monica,</v>

1220
00:34:02.571 --> 00:34:04.790
<v Speaker 6>you have like a more laid back sort of a vibe.</v>

1221
00:34:05.030 --> 00:34:05.900
<v Speaker 6>And I think part of that,</v>

1222
00:34:05.901 --> 00:34:08.660
<v Speaker 6>it's like you're faced with the reality of the ocean,</v>

1223
00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:09.410
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1224
00:34:09.410 --> 00:34:10.243
<v Speaker 6>Like you ain't shit</v>

1225
00:34:10.250 --> 00:34:11.150
<v Speaker 2>how massive this is.</v>

1226
00:34:11.770 --> 00:34:15.020
<v Speaker 2>You standing there next to this insane thing that you can't even go in.</v>

1227
00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:16.460
<v Speaker 2>And if it comes over you,</v>

1228
00:34:16.640 --> 00:34:17.473
<v Speaker 2>you're fucked.</v>

1229
00:34:17.540 --> 00:34:20.300
<v Speaker 2>And it does it every now and then you just playing Russian roulette that it</v>

1230
00:34:20.301 --> 00:34:21.140
<v Speaker 2>doesn't do it today.</v>

1231
00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:22.820
<v Speaker 2>One day though,</v>

1232
00:34:22.820 --> 00:34:23.690
<v Speaker 2>the earth moves</v>

1233
00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:28.820
<v Speaker 6>middle somewhere and a fucking seven mile high wall of water just watches a</v>

1234
00:34:29.030 --> 00:34:31.610
<v Speaker 6>hundred miles in all the way to fucking receipt a kills everybody.</v>

1235
00:34:31.640 --> 00:34:31.821
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1236
00:34:31.821 --> 00:34:32.450
<v Speaker 6>that happened</v>

1237
00:34:32.450 --> 00:34:33.283
<v Speaker 2>all the time.</v>

1238
00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:33.831
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's well,</v>

1239
00:34:33.831 --> 00:34:35.510
<v Speaker 2>it's nice to see the earth fight back.</v>

1240
00:34:35.511 --> 00:34:36.171
<v Speaker 2>Just be like,</v>

1241
00:34:36.171 --> 00:34:36.500
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1242
00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:37.400
<v Speaker 2>I'm still in control.</v>

1243
00:34:37.710 --> 00:34:37.921
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

1244
00:34:37.921 --> 00:34:38.760
<v Speaker 6>just to let you know,</v>

1245
00:34:38.761 --> 00:34:39.530
<v Speaker 6>like this is a,</v>

1246
00:34:39.530 --> 00:34:42.180
<v Speaker 6>you haven't locked this thing down at all.</v>

1247
00:34:42.350 --> 00:34:43.800
<v Speaker 6>You have zero control over the weather.</v>

1248
00:34:44.010 --> 00:34:45.630
<v Speaker 6>He have zero control of asteroids.</v>

1249
00:34:45.930 --> 00:34:46.830
<v Speaker 6>He has zero control,</v>

1250
00:34:46.831 --> 00:34:48.420
<v Speaker 6>super volcanoes and all the other shit.</v>

1251
00:34:48.630 --> 00:34:51.000
<v Speaker 2>Like a micro organisms could kill us anytime they want it.</v>

1252
00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:52.333
<v Speaker 2>We can't be scanned.</v>

1253
00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:54.260
<v Speaker 2>So I meant sorry,</v>

1254
00:34:54.270 --> 00:34:55.660
<v Speaker 2>I meant um,</v>

1255
00:34:55.980 --> 00:34:57.960
<v Speaker 2>was there any negative repercussions when you did that?</v>

1256
00:34:57.961 --> 00:34:58.794
<v Speaker 2>Fox News thing?</v>

1257
00:34:58.820 --> 00:34:59.061
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1258
00:34:59.061 --> 00:34:59.361
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1259
00:34:59.361 --> 00:35:00.800
<v Speaker 5>and wiped out my entire career,</v>

1260
00:35:01.370 --> 00:35:02.203
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1261
00:35:02.270 --> 00:35:03.980
<v Speaker 5>kind of switched.</v>

1262
00:35:03.981 --> 00:35:06.290
<v Speaker 5>I mean it was okay because I was kind of looking to make the switch anyway,</v>

1263
00:35:06.291 --> 00:35:10.400
<v Speaker 5>but it switched me from a completely college touring comedian that was basically</v>

1264
00:35:10.401 --> 00:35:13.670
<v Speaker 5>all my income was college touring and I had a largely apolitical,</v>

1265
00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:14.930
<v Speaker 5>largely clean,</v>

1266
00:35:14.931 --> 00:35:15.860
<v Speaker 5>but not exactly clean,</v>

1267
00:35:15.861 --> 00:35:17.480
<v Speaker 5>but a act.</v>

1268
00:35:17.540 --> 00:35:21.560
<v Speaker 5>And I was kind of switching more to politics and Karen more about that shit.</v>

1269
00:35:21.620 --> 00:35:23.240
<v Speaker 5>And after this clip went viral,</v>

1270
00:35:23.241 --> 00:35:25.760
<v Speaker 5>it was the first thing every activities board looks up on Google.</v>

1271
00:35:25.761 --> 00:35:26.620
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

1272
00:35:26.650 --> 00:35:27.200
<v Speaker 5>I've,</v>

1273
00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:28.580
<v Speaker 5>I did 500 colleges.</v>

1274
00:35:28.581 --> 00:35:30.410
<v Speaker 5>I've probably done 10 in the past four years.</v>

1275
00:35:30.540 --> 00:35:31.321
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>

1276
00:35:31.321 --> 00:35:32.550

1277
00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:33.600
<v Speaker 6>And for folks who don't know,</v>

1278
00:35:33.601 --> 00:35:34.830
<v Speaker 6>college has pay a lot of money.</v>

1279
00:35:34.831 --> 00:35:36.600
<v Speaker 6>Like a lot of guys when they're first coming up,</v>

1280
00:35:36.601 --> 00:35:37.950
<v Speaker 6>like that's number one goal.</v>

1281
00:35:37.951 --> 00:35:38.040
<v Speaker 6>The</v>

1282
00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:40.140
<v Speaker 4>first goal is to get a college agent,</v>

<v Speaker 4>do good at the convention.</v>

1285
00:35:42.481 --> 00:35:43.830
<v Speaker 4>And then started doing college tours.</v>

1286
00:35:44.110 --> 00:35:46.190
<v Speaker 4>That was a ton of money like you could do.</v>

1287
00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:46.411
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

00:35:46.411 --> 00:35:47.580
<v Speaker 4>Well you're a nobody.</v>

00:35:50.910 --> 00:35:51.181
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1292
00:35:51.181 --> 00:35:52.500
<v Speaker 4>I knew I was a nobody,</v>

1293
00:35:52.530 --> 00:35:52.990
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1294
00:35:52.990 --> 00:35:53.700
<v Speaker 4>like not even.</v>

1295
00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:53.881
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1296
00:35:53.881 --> 00:35:54.511
<v Speaker 4>I guess the nineties,</v>

1297
00:35:54.511 --> 00:35:55.860
<v Speaker 4>early nineties it was,</v>

1298
00:35:56.040 --> 00:35:58.080
<v Speaker 4>it was still like the early two thousands.</v>

1299
00:35:58.110 --> 00:35:58.800
<v Speaker 4>It's a good,</v>

1300
00:35:58.800 --> 00:35:59.850
<v Speaker 4>it's a really good place.</v>

1301
00:35:59.970 --> 00:36:01.890
<v Speaker 4>Some guys get in a rut unfortunately.</v>

1302
00:36:01.891 --> 00:36:03.600
<v Speaker 4>And they become just college comics.</v>

1303
00:36:03.750 --> 00:36:04.021
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1304
00:36:04.021 --> 00:36:06.540
<v Speaker 4>Which is why I was looking to change because you get stuck there,</v>

1305
00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:07.320
<v Speaker 4>don't you?</v>

1306
00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:08.021
<v Speaker 4>Totally do.</v>

1307
00:36:08.021 --> 00:36:08.880
<v Speaker 4>And people don't realize it,</v>

1308
00:36:08.881 --> 00:36:10.380
<v Speaker 4>but when you go to Naca,</v>

1309
00:36:10.390 --> 00:36:13.470
<v Speaker 4>like they offer you the chance to showcase,</v>

1310
00:36:13.471 --> 00:36:18.471
<v Speaker 4>but they would really like you to be like as as clean as possible.</v>

1311
00:36:19.170 --> 00:36:21.750
<v Speaker 4>They don't want you doing any Bradley really controversial Shit.</v>

1312
00:36:21.930 --> 00:36:23.840
<v Speaker 4>They want you to be able to like they a put you on.</v>

1313
00:36:23.850 --> 00:36:27.010
<v Speaker 4>They don't want to worry about getting any people that are offended that we're</v>

1314
00:36:27.050 --> 00:36:27.900
<v Speaker 4>gonna write letters,</v>

1315
00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:28.793
<v Speaker 4>emails,</v>

1316
00:36:28.890 --> 00:36:29.281
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

1317
00:36:29.281 --> 00:36:31.650
<v Speaker 4>People still have this impression of colleges from like,</v>

1318
00:36:31.651 --> 00:36:32.070
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

1319
00:36:32.070 --> 00:36:33.590
<v Speaker 4>the seventies and eighties where they likely,</v>

1320
00:36:33.730 --> 00:36:34.211
<v Speaker 5>oh yeah,</v>

1321
00:36:34.211 --> 00:36:37.480
<v Speaker 5>there are these activist hubs and everything now cause kids don't give a fuck.</v>

1322
00:36:37.540 --> 00:36:38.400

1323
00:36:38.430 --> 00:36:38.851
<v Speaker 6>in college,</v>

1324
00:36:38.851 --> 00:36:39.690
<v Speaker 6>which is really weird.</v>

1325
00:36:40.570 --> 00:36:42.480
<v Speaker 6>Joey Diaz and I did the University of Miami,</v>

1326
00:36:42.481 --> 00:36:45.690
<v Speaker 6>I think it was going to assume at some university in my final couple of years</v>

1327
00:36:45.691 --> 00:36:50.691
<v Speaker 6>back and we were in the middle of something and I remember I said I saw so many</v>

1328
00:36:51.571 --> 00:36:53.220
<v Speaker 6>people that didn't know what the fuck I was talking about.</v>

1329
00:36:53.221 --> 00:36:53.431
<v Speaker 6>I go,</v>

1330
00:36:53.431 --> 00:36:54.810
<v Speaker 6>how many people here are virgins?</v>

1331
00:36:55.590 --> 00:36:55.861
<v Speaker 6>I go,</v>

1332
00:36:55.861 --> 00:36:56.700
<v Speaker 6>you don't have to raise your hand.</v>

1333
00:36:56.701 --> 00:36:57.910
<v Speaker 6>I could just give me a little of this.</v>

1334
00:36:57.911 --> 00:37:00.470
<v Speaker 6>Just lift your hand yet.</v>

1335
00:37:00.740 --> 00:37:01.573
<v Speaker 6>There was a lot.</v>

1336
00:37:01.860 --> 00:37:02.340
<v Speaker 6>A lot.</v>

1337
00:37:02.340 --> 00:37:03.240
<v Speaker 6>It was and I was like,</v>

1338
00:37:03.241 --> 00:37:04.590
<v Speaker 6>you guys don't even know what I'm talking about.</v>

1339
00:37:04.980 --> 00:37:05.191
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

1340
00:37:05.191 --> 00:37:05.581
<v Speaker 6>oh my God,</v>

1341
00:37:05.581 --> 00:37:06.330
<v Speaker 6>you're in college.</v>

1342
00:37:06.330 --> 00:37:07.320
<v Speaker 6>You guys have to fuck.</v>

1343
00:37:07.410 --> 00:37:07.910
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1344
00:37:07.910 --> 00:37:08.730
<v Speaker 6>Get it over with.</v>

1345
00:37:08.730 --> 00:37:11.130
<v Speaker 6>This is a big part of life and you haven't even started it yet.</v>

1346
00:37:11.790 --> 00:37:12.591
<v Speaker 5>That was your game.</v>

1347
00:37:12.591 --> 00:37:13.424
<v Speaker 5>Probably though.</v>

1348
00:37:13.570 --> 00:37:14.360
<v Speaker 5>You're at Miami,</v>

1349
00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:15.171
<v Speaker 5>University of Miami.</v>

1350
00:37:15.171 --> 00:37:15.981
<v Speaker 5>You guys need to fuck.</v>

1351
00:37:15.981 --> 00:37:16.820
<v Speaker 5>So we're having a party.</v>

1352
00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:21.560
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1353
00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:24.710
<v Speaker 4>but even if they know what you mean when you say a joke about fucking they</v>

1354
00:37:24.711 --> 00:37:25.580
<v Speaker 4>probably a little sad.</v>

1355
00:37:25.581 --> 00:37:26.210
<v Speaker 4>They're not doing it,</v>

1356
00:37:26.210 --> 00:37:28.400
<v Speaker 4>so they get so mad at so many different things.</v>

1357
00:37:28.401 --> 00:37:29.720
<v Speaker 4>People are looking forward to</v>

1358
00:37:29.830 --> 00:37:32.080
<v Speaker 6>protesting in a lot of ways in colleges.</v>

1359
00:37:32.081 --> 00:37:35.590
<v Speaker 6>They're trying to stretch out their protest muscles and you know,</v>

1360
00:37:35.591 --> 00:37:36.660
<v Speaker 6>sometimes misguided,</v>

1361
00:37:36.670 --> 00:37:37.540
<v Speaker 6>sometimes guided.</v>

1362
00:37:37.541 --> 00:37:42.490
<v Speaker 6>It's a lot of it is done in the correct mindset.</v>

1363
00:37:42.550 --> 00:37:45.850
<v Speaker 6>Whether or not it's the correct idea to protests in the first place,</v>

1364
00:37:45.851 --> 00:37:50.020
<v Speaker 6>but you could have a joke about anything that someone finds misogynistic and</v>

1365
00:37:50.021 --> 00:37:50.471
<v Speaker 6>next thing you know,</v>

1366
00:37:50.471 --> 00:37:52.340
<v Speaker 6>there's a giant letter that's written about you,</v>

1367
00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:53.050
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1368
00:37:53.050 --> 00:37:56.200
<v Speaker 6>from one of the people that attended your college show and then you have to deal</v>

1369
00:37:56.201 --> 00:37:56.610
<v Speaker 6>with that.</v>

1370
00:37:56.610 --> 00:37:56.941
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1371
00:37:56.941 --> 00:37:59.700
<v Speaker 5>I actually went to one where they told me beforehand they go,</v>

1372
00:37:59.701 --> 00:38:00.001
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

1373
00:38:00.001 --> 00:38:01.500
<v Speaker 5>so don't curse and uh,</v>

1374
00:38:01.501 --> 00:38:01.810
<v Speaker 5>don't,</v>

1375
00:38:01.810 --> 00:38:02.610
<v Speaker 5>don't.</v>

1376
00:38:02.610 --> 00:38:03.271
<v Speaker 5>This is the best.</v>

1377
00:38:03.271 --> 00:38:04.860
<v Speaker 5>Don't mention drugs or alcohol.</v>

1378
00:38:05.250 --> 00:38:06.000
<v Speaker 5>And it was like,</v>

1379
00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:07.650
<v Speaker 5>what order a clown then.</v>

1380
00:38:07.651 --> 00:38:08.011
<v Speaker 5>All right,</v>

1381
00:38:08.011 --> 00:38:09.690
<v Speaker 5>you don't want a comedian if you're like,</v>

1382
00:38:10.140 --> 00:38:11.760
<v Speaker 5>act like half of life doesn't exist.</v>

1383
00:38:11.890 --> 00:38:13.750
<v Speaker 6>I remember someone said there's a,</v>

1384
00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:16.510
<v Speaker 6>like a stock joke to Jews walking to a bar.</v>

1385
00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:18.900
<v Speaker 6>They buy it silly,</v>

1386
00:38:18.990 --> 00:38:19.320
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1387
00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:19.840
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

1388
00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:22.960
<v Speaker 6>Someone said it and this guy comes up and says,</v>

1389
00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:25.000
<v Speaker 6>I was very offended by that Jewish joke.</v>

1390
00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:25.781
<v Speaker 6>I go,</v>

1391
00:38:25.781 --> 00:38:27.160
<v Speaker 6>that's the most ridiculous shit ever.</v>

1392
00:38:27.190 --> 00:38:30.310
<v Speaker 6>Listen to what he said to Jews walk into a bar and they buy it.</v>

1393
00:38:30.311 --> 00:38:32.530
<v Speaker 6>That means they purchased these.</v>

1394
00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:34.180
<v Speaker 6>They have a lot of money and they purchased businesses.</v>

1395
00:38:34.420 --> 00:38:34.580
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

1396
00:38:34.580 --> 00:38:34.780
<v Speaker 6>what?</v>

1397
00:38:34.780 --> 00:38:35.890
<v Speaker 6>What's about that?</v>

1398
00:38:36.430 --> 00:38:37.211
<v Speaker 6>How could you be offended?</v>

1399
00:38:37.211 --> 00:38:39.310
<v Speaker 6>But I like that they're looking to be offended.</v>

1400
00:38:39.311 --> 00:38:41.170
<v Speaker 6>People are looking to be,</v>

1401
00:38:41.270 --> 00:38:42.400
<v Speaker 6>to just hear they're buzzword.</v>

1402
00:38:42.670 --> 00:38:44.800
<v Speaker 6>That is totally a buzzword because that joke is,</v>

1403
00:38:44.830 --> 00:38:46.000
<v Speaker 6>it's not about cheap.</v>

1404
00:38:46.330 --> 00:38:48.910
<v Speaker 6>It's about guys who purchased a bar.</v>

1405
00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:50.890
<v Speaker 6>It's so stupid.</v>

1406
00:38:50.891 --> 00:38:51.310
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>

1407
00:38:51.310 --> 00:38:52.143
<v Speaker 6>what are you saying?</v>

1408
00:38:52.650 --> 00:38:54.390
<v Speaker 6>It's bad to be a bad ass businessman.</v>

1409
00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:56.110
<v Speaker 6>I'm so confused why you're upset.</v>

1410
00:38:56.560 --> 00:38:57.170
<v Speaker 6>But it's still,</v>

1411
00:38:57.170 --> 00:38:58.200
<v Speaker 6>they're not really upset there.</v>

1412
00:38:58.201 --> 00:39:00.260
<v Speaker 6>So looking at me upset and there's,</v>

1413
00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:03.730
<v Speaker 6>there's a difference between someone who's actually like protesting something</v>

1414
00:39:03.731 --> 00:39:07.810
<v Speaker 6>that's real and someone will get upset at nonsense and it's fucking.</v>

1415
00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:09.190
<v Speaker 6>It's really frustrating.</v>

1416
00:39:09.310 --> 00:39:10.143
<v Speaker 6>Like there's a um,</v>

1417
00:39:10.330 --> 00:39:10.511
<v Speaker 6>there's,</v>

1418
00:39:10.511 --> 00:39:11.610
<v Speaker 6>something's going on today.</v>

1419
00:39:11.770 --> 00:39:13.180
<v Speaker 6>There's a female protest her.</v>

1420
00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:14.200
<v Speaker 6>Did you see this thing?</v>

1421
00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:15.273
<v Speaker 6>And she's a,</v>

1422
00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:20.400
<v Speaker 6>she got arrested for sexual assault because she kissed or a riot policeman's</v>

1423
00:39:20.561 --> 00:39:23.140
<v Speaker 6>helmet and there's a picture of her doing it.</v>

1424
00:39:23.700 --> 00:39:24.070
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>

1425
00:39:24.070 --> 00:39:25.540
<v Speaker 6>it's really weird,</v>

1426
00:39:25.541 --> 00:39:25.721
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

1427
00:39:25.721 --> 00:39:26.740
<v Speaker 6>And it's in Italy,</v>

1428
00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:27.820
<v Speaker 6>my people,</v>

1429
00:39:28.030 --> 00:39:29.170
<v Speaker 6>you fucking dummies.</v>

1430
00:39:29.260 --> 00:39:30.100
<v Speaker 6>How dare you,</v>

1431
00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:31.510
<v Speaker 6>how dare this girl is beautiful.</v>

1432
00:39:31.540 --> 00:39:35.260
<v Speaker 6>And she's pretty and she's kissing this helmet and they arrested her for sexual</v>

1433
00:39:35.261 --> 00:39:35.560
<v Speaker 6>assault.</v>

1434

<v Speaker 6>Like that's not,</v>

1435
00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:38.440
<v Speaker 6>that's not the correct use of power.</v>

1436
00:39:38.441 --> 00:39:39.130
<v Speaker 6>That's abusive</v>

1437
00:39:39.130 --> 00:39:40.060
<v Speaker 2>power in the UK,</v>

1438
00:39:40.061 --> 00:39:43.450
<v Speaker 2>they were prosecuting a protest because he called a police horse.</v>

1439
00:39:43.451 --> 00:39:44.080
<v Speaker 2>Gay.</v>

1440

<v Speaker 2>Sexual assault were Mexican.</v>

1443
00:39:49.150 --> 00:39:51.670

00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:52.553
<v Speaker 2>Vimeo.</v>

1447
00:39:53.620 --> 00:39:55.370
<v Speaker 2>I feel like he's well protected against girls.</v>

1448
00:39:55.390 --> 00:39:56.223
<v Speaker 2>So privileged.</v>

1449
00:39:56.680 --> 00:39:57.520
<v Speaker 2>That's so crazy.</v>

1450
00:39:57.780 --> 00:39:58.290
<v Speaker 2>That's just.</v>

1453
00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:01.820
<v Speaker 2>He's essentially got a face condom on right now.</v>

1454
00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:03.580
<v Speaker 2>Has a finger in her.</v>

1455

<v Speaker 2>They got together,</v>

1456

1457
00:40:07.550 --> 00:40:09.900
<v Speaker 6>is so weird.</v>

1458
00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:12.390
<v Speaker 6>The things that people try to get away with like something like that,</v>

1459
00:40:12.391 --> 00:40:13.740
<v Speaker 6>like how could you try to get away with that,</v>

1460
00:40:14.030 --> 00:40:16.410
<v Speaker 6>how you don't know that that's a bad thing to do this,</v>

1461
00:40:16.830 --> 00:40:17.280
<v Speaker 6>this,</v>

1462
00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:17.850
<v Speaker 6>this.</v>

1463
00:40:17.850 --> 00:40:21.930
<v Speaker 6>Making someone go to court in arresting them for sexual assault,</v>

1464
00:40:22.050 --> 00:40:26.120
<v Speaker 6>for kissing a fucking woman who's gently kissing a policeman's outfit.</v>

1465
00:40:26.610 --> 00:40:27.443
<v Speaker 6>Children here.</v>

1466
00:40:27.650 --> 00:40:29.000
<v Speaker 2>This dude went into chase.</v>

1467
00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:29.781
<v Speaker 2>Reverend Billy,</v>

1468
00:40:29.781 --> 00:40:32.540
<v Speaker 2>well known prior to protest rate was facing a year in jail cause he went into</v>

1469
00:40:32.541 --> 00:40:36.470
<v Speaker 2>chase bank with some people and they sang about the death of the rain forest or</v>

1470
00:40:36.471 --> 00:40:38.090
<v Speaker 2>something and they called it riot.</v>

1471
00:40:38.091 --> 00:40:40.580
<v Speaker 2>Causing a riot or they should go to jail for being dumb,</v>

1472
00:40:40.980 --> 00:40:44.330
<v Speaker 2>but riots for a singing is a riot.</v>

1473
00:40:44.420 --> 00:40:48.500
<v Speaker 2>You can't save the rain forest at the fucking bank by singing so misguided.</v>

1474
00:40:49.990 --> 00:40:50.391
<v Speaker 2>Seriously.</v>

1475
00:40:50.391 --> 00:40:52.790
<v Speaker 2>That's like trying to win a game of pool when you're at home in bed.</v>

1476
00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:55.730
<v Speaker 2>To be fair in this picture that we don't know if this lasted for 30 minutes.</v>

1477
00:40:55.731 --> 00:40:57.800
<v Speaker 2>Her trying to grope them and like tried to grab his dick.</v>

1478
00:40:57.820 --> 00:40:58.653
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

1479
00:40:58.740 --> 00:41:00.110
<v Speaker 6>She says kissed.</v>

1480
00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:01.460
<v Speaker 6>If she did all that other stuff,</v>

1481
00:41:01.461 --> 00:41:01.740
<v Speaker 6>they would.</v>

1482
00:41:01.740 --> 00:41:02.690
<v Speaker 6>They would drag it out.</v>

1483
00:41:02.740 --> 00:41:03.000
<v Speaker 6>It would.</v>

1484
00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:04.040
<v Speaker 6>They would add that as well.</v>

1485
00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:05.150
<v Speaker 6>All she did kiss him.</v>

1486
00:41:05.390 --> 00:41:06.020
<v Speaker 6>She kissed him.</v>

1487
00:41:06.020 --> 00:41:07.400
<v Speaker 6>I mean his pants were off during that,</v>

1488
00:41:07.401 --> 00:41:10.020
<v Speaker 6>but people are so fucking silly like that.</v>

1489
00:41:10.130 --> 00:41:10.371
<v Speaker 6>Look,</v>

1490
00:41:10.371 --> 00:41:11.300
<v Speaker 6>you know what happened there?</v>

1491
00:41:11.390 --> 00:41:12.223
<v Speaker 6>No one got hurt.</v>

1492
00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:14.690
<v Speaker 6>Like the idea that you would do that,</v>

1493
00:41:15.140 --> 00:41:18.140
<v Speaker 6>try to take someone through the legal system for something so silly.</v>

1494
00:41:18.141 --> 00:41:21.470
<v Speaker 6>That makes me angry that you have any power because you're a petty piece of</v>

1495
00:41:21.471 --> 00:41:22.190
<v Speaker 6>shit.</v>

1496
00:41:22.190 --> 00:41:22.401
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1497
00:41:22.401 --> 00:41:23.960
<v Speaker 6>to do that to someone to just kiss you.</v>

1498
00:41:24.140 --> 00:41:24.441
<v Speaker 6>Come on,</v>

00:41:24.441 --> 00:41:25.550
<v Speaker 6>you're a pending piece of shit.</v>

1500
00:41:25.670 --> 00:41:26.211
<v Speaker 6>That's cute.</v>

1501
00:41:26.211 --> 00:41:28.550
<v Speaker 6>You don't think it's cute that a beautiful woman kiss your fucking shield</v>

1502
00:41:28.700 --> 00:41:30.110
<v Speaker 6>Shinara you do stop.</v>

1503
00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:31.970
<v Speaker 6>It's like when that Uc Davis,</v>

1504
00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:33.980
<v Speaker 6>UC Davis got pepper</v>

1505
00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:34.251
<v Speaker 2>sprayed,</v>

1506
00:41:34.251 --> 00:41:37.160
<v Speaker 2>all those kids and the world just went fucking bananas.</v>

1507
00:41:37.410 --> 00:41:37.840
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1508
00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:38.511
<v Speaker 2>it's the same thing.</v>

1509
00:41:38.511 --> 00:41:38.900
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1510
00:41:38.900 --> 00:41:39.441
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1511
00:41:39.441 --> 00:41:40.274
<v Speaker 2>that's not right.</v>

1512
00:41:40.550 --> 00:41:40.881
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1513
00:41:40.881 --> 00:41:42.210

<v Speaker 2>Did you see?</v>

1515
00:41:43.450 --> 00:41:44.181
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you can look it up,</v>

1516
00:41:44.181 --> 00:41:47.540
<v Speaker 2>but he sued and got something like $30,000.</v>

00:41:50.211 --> 00:41:50.840
<v Speaker 2>After doing that.</v>

1521
00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:53.960
<v Speaker 2>Well from the Internet response for a posttraumatic stress.</v>

1524
00:41:55.310 --> 00:41:56.143
<v Speaker 2>Of course it did.</v>

1525
00:42:01.730 --> 00:42:02.540

1529
00:42:07.950 --> 00:42:09.200
<v Speaker 2>I guess as he says,</v>

1530
00:42:09.201 --> 00:42:12.380
<v Speaker 2>he's not prepared to brush off the incident as a peaceful gesture.</v>

1531
00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:14.600
<v Speaker 2>God put an idiot.</v>

1532

1541
00:42:26.180 --> 00:42:26.901
<v Speaker 2>It was like a year ago,</v>

1542
00:42:26.901 --> 00:42:27.410

<v Speaker 2>The occupation was part of the art walk or whatever,</v>

1546
00:42:31.550 --> 00:42:32.480
<v Speaker 2>and they were getting writers.</v>

1547

<v Speaker 2>I showed up.</v>

1548
00:42:32.901 --> 00:42:36.120
<v Speaker 2>They were getting shot with rubber bullets for writing and chalk on the</v>

1549

1551
00:42:42.471 --> 00:42:45.630
<v Speaker 2>bullets can fuck you up and take on an eye too if they hit you in the eye.</v>

1552
00:42:45.780 --> 00:42:47.030
<v Speaker 2>I know a girl last night.</v>

1553
00:42:47.240 --> 00:42:48.230
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

1554
00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:52.040
<v Speaker 2>It's so crazy from a fucking what I got shot with one of the long time ago.</v>

1555
00:42:52.100 --> 00:42:53.150
<v Speaker 2>You get shot with rubber bullets.</v>

1556
00:42:53.160 --> 00:42:53.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1559
00:42:56.600 --> 00:42:57.860
<v Speaker 2>like shit just went crazy.</v>

1560
00:42:57.861 --> 00:42:59.270
<v Speaker 2>I people would catch cars on fire.</v>

1561
00:42:59.300 --> 00:43:03.830
<v Speaker 2>They would bomb the whole entire campus with a lot with tear gas and stuff.</v>

1562
00:43:03.831 --> 00:43:05.240
<v Speaker 2>So even if you're in your house,</v>

1563
00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:08.810
<v Speaker 2>you would still have tear gas in your house and say that.</v>

1564
00:43:08.810 --> 00:43:10.110
<v Speaker 2>You mean the students would do that?</v>

<v Speaker 2>The cubs,</v>

1566
00:43:11.940 --> 00:43:15.170
<v Speaker 2>the campus police to break up the protest.</v>

00:43:16.340 --> 00:43:17.820
<v Speaker 2>It was just nonstop partying.</v>

1570
00:43:17.821 --> 00:43:21.280
<v Speaker 2>Like every street had houses on our cars on fire and party in here.</v>

1571
00:43:21.290 --> 00:43:22.123
<v Speaker 2>Some tear gas.</v>

1572
00:43:22.130 --> 00:43:22.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1573
00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:23.090

1574
00:43:23.090 --> 00:43:26.870
<v Speaker 2>they used to just shoot the rubber bullets to get us off the streets and I was</v>

1575
00:43:26.871 --> 00:43:29.960
<v Speaker 2>just walking from a bar to my house trying to get back to my house.</v>

1576
00:43:29.961 --> 00:43:30.201
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

1577
00:43:30.201 --> 00:43:30.711
<v Speaker 2>get in your house.</v>

1578
00:43:30.711 --> 00:43:31.070
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1579
00:43:31.070 --> 00:43:34.790
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to walk and they just start firing at as it hit me in the leg and my</v>

1580
00:43:34.791 --> 00:43:37.280
<v Speaker 2>whole leg just bubbled up and got black and it hurt.</v>

1581
00:43:37.281 --> 00:43:38.040
<v Speaker 2>Like fuck.</v>

1582
00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:38.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1583
00:43:38.660 --> 00:43:39.680
<v Speaker 2>that's some rude shit.</v>

1584
00:43:40.180 --> 00:43:41.600
<v Speaker 2>I mean those fucking things.</v>

1585
00:43:41.601 --> 00:43:43.700
<v Speaker 2>It's not like like a nerf bullet,</v>

1586
00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:46.340
<v Speaker 2>the rubber and they're going like bullet speeds,</v>

1587
00:43:46.630 --> 00:43:47.180
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1588
00:43:47.180 --> 00:43:52.010
<v Speaker 2>I think that's pretty fucking trains train guys used to shoot us,</v>

1589
00:43:52.040 --> 00:43:53.100
<v Speaker 2>try to shoot us to like,</v>

1590
00:43:53.240 --> 00:43:54.200
<v Speaker 2>like on train tracks.</v>

1591
00:43:54.200 --> 00:43:55.820
<v Speaker 2>We would always like put like nickels and quarters,</v>

1592
00:43:55.821 --> 00:43:58.340
<v Speaker 2>like on the train tracks and stuff and they would see us near and they'll just</v>

1593
00:43:58.341 --> 00:44:01.370
<v Speaker 2>start firing these guns and then they wouldn't really aim it at it.</v>

1594
00:44:01.371 --> 00:44:02.390
<v Speaker 2>They were just trying to scare us.</v>

1595
00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:04.490
<v Speaker 2>They were rubber bullet guns,</v>

1596
00:44:04.580 --> 00:44:08.420
<v Speaker 2>but they were just like firing in the air and they're fucking Ohio,</v>

1597
00:44:08.421 --> 00:44:10.790
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of savages and they might as well be in the dark ages.</v>

1598
00:44:12.090 --> 00:44:17.090
<v Speaker 2>That's a weird thing that people are doing this bullet bullet look that's next</v>

1599
00:44:18.281 --> 00:44:18.740
<v Speaker 2>to that kid.</v>

1600
00:44:18.740 --> 00:44:20.120
<v Speaker 2>That dude got jacked.</v>

1601
00:44:22.090 --> 00:44:23.060
<v Speaker 2>It is really weird.</v>

1602
00:44:23.061 --> 00:44:23.960
<v Speaker 2>They're allowed to do that.</v>

1603
00:44:24.050 --> 00:44:24.291
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1604
00:44:24.291 --> 00:44:25.124
<v Speaker 2>come on.</v>

1605
00:44:25.490 --> 00:44:29.000
<v Speaker 2>Especially when it's really drives me crazy is when they look at the size of</v>

1606
00:44:29.001 --> 00:44:29.390
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1607
00:44:29.390 --> 00:44:34.140
<v Speaker 2>the proof that they've used agent provocateur is to break up protests where they</v>

1608
00:44:34.500 --> 00:44:37.560
<v Speaker 2>hire cops to put masks on and start breaking shit.</v>

1609
00:44:37.590 --> 00:44:40.350
<v Speaker 2>Tons of them and then they go to the protest is a breaking shit.</v>

1610
00:44:40.380 --> 00:44:44.420
<v Speaker 2>We have to hire cops and arrest everybody and suddenly</v>

1611
00:44:44.530 --> 00:44:45.141
<v Speaker 6>they move in.</v>

1612
00:44:45.141 --> 00:44:49.060
<v Speaker 6>They turn a non peaceful protest into a or a peaceful protest and do a violence.</v>

1613
00:44:49.060 --> 00:44:51.620
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's the thing that most of these occupied like half of the people that</v>

1614
00:44:51.640 --> 00:44:51.970
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

1615
00:44:51.970 --> 00:44:53.380
<v Speaker 2>like a quarter of the people were cops.</v>

1616
00:44:54.400 --> 00:44:55.270
<v Speaker 2>That's the inside joke,</v>

1617
00:44:55.271 --> 00:44:55.451
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1618
00:44:55.451 --> 00:44:57.820
<v Speaker 2>It got to the point where people were saying that there's like 30 something</v>

1619
00:44:57.821 --> 00:45:02.440
<v Speaker 2>percent like literally of all occupy people wonder if that guy,</v>

1620
00:45:02.441 --> 00:45:07.030
<v Speaker 2>the CIA guy was there to fake it was his job in climate experts trying to save</v>

1621
00:45:07.031 --> 00:45:07.421
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>

1622
00:45:07.421 --> 00:45:09.190
<v Speaker 2>He's also trying to get some hippie pussy.</v>

1623
00:45:09.191 --> 00:45:10.024
<v Speaker 2>Yet</v>

1624
00:45:11.120 --> 00:45:12.740
<v Speaker 2>you tried to go to the</v>

1625
00:45:13.180 --> 00:45:13.730
<v Speaker 6>COUPA.</v>

1626
00:45:13.730 --> 00:45:16.710
<v Speaker 6>What is the current status of occupied because it seemed like it was real</v>

1627
00:45:16.711 --> 00:45:17.720
<v Speaker 6>exciting for awhile,</v>

1628
00:45:17.900 --> 00:45:21.410
<v Speaker 6>but now it just seems like it's been infiltrated like the mob</v>

1629
00:45:21.800 --> 00:45:23.300
<v Speaker 2>and brought to its knees.</v>

1630
00:45:23.380 --> 00:45:23.780
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1631
00:45:23.780 --> 00:45:24.613
<v Speaker 2>I think that,</v>

1632
00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:27.980
<v Speaker 2>I don't know whether the brand occupy will continue,</v>

1633
00:45:27.981 --> 00:45:30.920
<v Speaker 2>but the activists that were kind of activated by occupy,</v>

1634
00:45:30.921 --> 00:45:32.470
<v Speaker 2>I think they're all still out there and then I'll do it.</v>

1635
00:45:32.471 --> 00:45:33.021
<v Speaker 2>A lot of things.</v>

1636
00:45:33.021 --> 00:45:34.100
<v Speaker 2>A lot of it's online,</v>

1637
00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:35.290
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>

1638
00:45:35.290 --> 00:45:36.150
<v Speaker 6>I don't.</v>

1639
00:45:36.180 --> 00:45:38.190
<v Speaker 6>I'm not trying to demean their efforts,</v>

1640
00:45:38.191 --> 00:45:41.550
<v Speaker 6>but what I'm saying is that at one point in time there was this sense when all</v>

1641
00:45:41.551 --> 00:45:45.610
<v Speaker 6>these people were lining up around these businesses and they're camping out in</v>

1642
00:45:45.620 --> 00:45:45.740
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

1643
00:45:45.740 --> 00:45:46.890
<v Speaker 6>in these parks.</v>

1644
00:45:47.310 --> 00:45:50.130
<v Speaker 6>There was a sense that like the way I described it was like it was almost like</v>

1645
00:45:50.131 --> 00:45:55.110
<v Speaker 6>some white blood cell cells had gathered around some sort of an injury,</v>

1646
00:45:55.260 --> 00:45:58.170
<v Speaker 6>like some white blood cells figured out there's something wrong with this area</v>

1647
00:45:58.410 --> 00:46:01.050
<v Speaker 6>and we're just going to surround it until we figured it out and that's what</v>

1648
00:46:01.051 --> 00:46:01.801
<v Speaker 6>these people are dealing with.</v>

1649
00:46:01.801 --> 00:46:06.801
<v Speaker 6>Standing there and having all their speeches and the parks and protesting and.</v>

1650
00:46:08.070 --> 00:46:11.130
<v Speaker 6>But then it became like a thing to do as well.</v>

1651
00:46:11.160 --> 00:46:12.030
<v Speaker 6>It became like,</v>

1652
00:46:12.430 --> 00:46:12.780
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1653
00:46:12.780 --> 00:46:15.510
<v Speaker 6>it developed like sort of like a social thing of its own.</v>

1654
00:46:15.770 --> 00:46:16.231
<v Speaker 6>It became,</v>

1655
00:46:16.231 --> 00:46:17.064
<v Speaker 6>when you show him Brian,</v>

1656
00:46:17.190 --> 00:46:19.300
<v Speaker 6>this is like some of the Shit I was telling you,</v>

1657
00:46:19.350 --> 00:46:21.030
<v Speaker 6>oh look at Ohio state stuff.</v>

1658
00:46:21.570 --> 00:46:26.570
<v Speaker 6>The occupy thing became like I was listening to this interview with this kid who</v>

1659
00:46:26.851 --> 00:46:27.684
<v Speaker 6>is a,</v>

1660
00:46:27.810 --> 00:46:30.180
<v Speaker 6>he was in college and didn't know what he's going to do with his life and he</v>

1661
00:46:30.181 --> 00:46:31.040
<v Speaker 6>decided to drop out,</v>

1662
00:46:31.060 --> 00:46:32.430
<v Speaker 6>become a part of the occupy movement.</v>

1663
00:46:32.431 --> 00:46:35.220
<v Speaker 6>And like then once I saw that it became clear what I should do with my life.</v>

1664
00:46:35.640 --> 00:46:36.091
<v Speaker 6>And I'm like,</v>

1665
00:46:36.091 --> 00:46:36.630
<v Speaker 6>wow,</v>

1666
00:46:36.630 --> 00:46:37.463
<v Speaker 6>okay.</v>

1667
00:46:37.590 --> 00:46:38.460
<v Speaker 6>I don't know about that.</v>

1668
00:46:39.940 --> 00:46:44.830
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people rocky were activated by it and kind of realized what was going</v>

1669
00:46:44.831 --> 00:46:48.880
<v Speaker 2>on with our society and I think that's incredibly important.</v>

1670
00:46:48.881 --> 00:46:49.360
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1671
00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:50.193
<v Speaker 2>you also have to,</v>

1672
00:46:50.560 --> 00:46:51.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1673
00:46:51.150 --> 00:46:51.521
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

1674
00:46:51.521 --> 00:46:53.590
<v Speaker 2>there are a million failings and we could go through them all,</v>

1675
00:46:53.591 --> 00:46:58.510
<v Speaker 2>but you have to think this is the first ever spontaneous global protest movement</v>

1676
00:46:58.511 --> 00:46:59.650
<v Speaker 2>in mankind's history.</v>

1677
00:46:59.651 --> 00:47:02.260
<v Speaker 2>That's an achievement in and of itself and it also changed the entire</v>

1678
00:47:02.261 --> 00:47:06.250
<v Speaker 2>conversation in the country from austerity to the fact that hey,</v>

1679
00:47:06.490 --> 00:47:10.660
<v Speaker 2>these like couple of thousand people have an incredible amount of wealth.</v>

1680
00:47:10.710 --> 00:47:11.543
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1681
00:47:11.690 --> 00:47:15.290
<v Speaker 6>What I was going to say is that it was sort of one of those things when you've</v>

1682
00:47:15.291 --> 00:47:16.700
<v Speaker 6>seen all these people protest,</v>

1683
00:47:17.020 --> 00:47:17.810
<v Speaker 6>were you,</v>

1684
00:47:17.810 --> 00:47:19.960
<v Speaker 6>you were realizing that this,</v>

1685
00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:22.820
<v Speaker 6>this model of like no leader thing,</v>

1686
00:47:23.100 --> 00:47:23.933
<v Speaker 6>it doesn't really work.</v>

1687
00:47:23.980 --> 00:47:24.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1688
00:47:24.290 --> 00:47:24.471
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1689
00:47:24.471 --> 00:47:25.610
<v Speaker 2>It needs to be something in between.</v>

1690
00:47:25.611 --> 00:47:26.211
<v Speaker 2>I believe that yeah.</v>

1691
00:47:26.211 --> 00:47:26.780
<v Speaker 2>It's like this.</v>

1692
00:47:26.780 --> 00:47:30.100
<v Speaker 2>It's sort of like got infiltrated and then sort of scattered and it lost its</v>

1693
00:47:30.130 --> 00:47:33.400
<v Speaker 4>message in a lot of people's eyes and then it stopped being relevant.</v>

1694
00:47:33.410 --> 00:47:34.290
<v Speaker 4>A lot of people,</v>

1695
00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:35.440
<v Speaker 4>when they talk about the news,</v>

1696
00:47:35.650 --> 00:47:37.930
<v Speaker 4>you don't really hear about occupy protests very often anymore.</v>

1697
00:47:37.990 --> 00:47:39.740
<v Speaker 4>It was a big thing for quite a while.</v>

1698
00:47:39.880 --> 00:47:41.770
<v Speaker 4>We'd hear about it on a regular basis,</v>

1699
00:47:41.771 --> 00:47:42.780
<v Speaker 4>but I think I,</v>

1700
00:47:42.850 --> 00:47:44.920
<v Speaker 4>I hate the idea of leaders,</v>

1701
00:47:45.280 --> 00:47:49.780
<v Speaker 4>but I think there's something to at least like a governing body that keeps</v>

1702
00:47:49.781 --> 00:47:50.710
<v Speaker 4>everything together.</v>

1703
00:47:50.780 --> 00:47:51.430
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1704
00:47:51.430 --> 00:47:52.010
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1705
00:47:52.010 --> 00:47:55.140
<v Speaker 5>There needs to be some leaders that I think there needs to be some democracy</v>

1706
00:47:55.141 --> 00:47:55.411
<v Speaker 5>stuff,</v>

1707
00:47:55.411 --> 00:47:56.131
<v Speaker 5>some form.</v>

1708
00:47:56.131 --> 00:47:56.850
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1709
00:47:56.850 --> 00:47:58.170
<v Speaker 5>but it was interesting to see.</v>

1710
00:47:58.171 --> 00:47:58.411
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1711
00:47:58.411 --> 00:47:59.160
<v Speaker 5>a lot of their,</v>

1712
00:47:59.160 --> 00:48:02.050
<v Speaker 5>a lot of the collapse of it besides the pepper spray and the,</v>

1713
00:48:02.140 --> 00:48:04.890
<v Speaker 5>and the shooting with rubber bullets and all that stuff that was done.</v>

1714
00:48:05.240 --> 00:48:05.561
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1715
00:48:05.561 --> 00:48:05.800
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1716
00:48:05.800 --> 00:48:09.900
<v Speaker 5>it was because the media all Kinda came together and said we are all going to</v>

1717
00:48:09.901 --> 00:48:10.321
<v Speaker 5>trash it.</v>

1718
00:48:10.321 --> 00:48:13.770
<v Speaker 5>I mean the New York Times first article on it like online or whatever,</v>

1719
00:48:13.830 --> 00:48:18.210
<v Speaker 5>a few days in or maybe a weekend was just saying how stupid it was and how,</v>

1720
00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:18.430
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

1721
00:48:18.430 --> 00:48:21.450
<v Speaker 5>the mascot of the movement is this topless girl who's dancing.</v>

1722
00:48:21.451 --> 00:48:22.980
<v Speaker 5>And it was like ridiculous.</v>

1723
00:48:23.130 --> 00:48:23.761
<v Speaker 5>I was down there.</v>

1724
00:48:23.761 --> 00:48:24.920
<v Speaker 5>I knew exactly what they were talking about it,</v>

1725
00:48:24.921 --> 00:48:25.770
<v Speaker 5>it was ridiculous.</v>

1726
00:48:26.100 --> 00:48:26.731
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

1727
00:48:26.731 --> 00:48:28.170
<v Speaker 5>and so that's the left wing,</v>

1728
00:48:28.171 --> 00:48:28.861
<v Speaker 5>New York Times.</v>

1729
00:48:28.861 --> 00:48:29.101
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1730
00:48:29.101 --> 00:48:29.550
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>

1731
00:48:29.550 --> 00:48:30.290
<v Speaker 5>that's our media,</v>

1732
00:48:30.290 --> 00:48:30.651
<v Speaker 4>the number.</v>

1733
00:48:30.651 --> 00:48:32.570
<v Speaker 4>When Giuliani was doing that speech,</v>

1734
00:48:32.571 --> 00:48:32.841
<v Speaker 4>he said,</v>

1735
00:48:32.841 --> 00:48:35.030
<v Speaker 4>why don't you go occupy a job?</v>

1736
00:48:35.340 --> 00:48:36.173
<v Speaker 5>Eh,</v>

1737
00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:37.073
<v Speaker 5>Eh,</v>

1738
00:48:38.120 --> 00:48:43.120
<v Speaker 5>a bad opening act and Jersey maybe because a lot of these people were occupying</v>

1739
00:48:43.451 --> 00:48:47.380
<v Speaker 5>a job for like $7 an hour and couldn't afford the bus home from the job.</v>

1740
00:48:47.460 --> 00:48:47.641
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1741
00:48:47.641 --> 00:48:48.421
<v Speaker 4>You want to talk about it?</v>

1742
00:48:48.421 --> 00:48:49.530
<v Speaker 4>Dude is out of the loop.</v>

1743
00:48:49.750 --> 00:48:50.880
<v Speaker 4>Are you really saying that man?</v>

1744
00:48:51.350 --> 00:48:51.540
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1745
00:48:51.540 --> 00:48:52.380
<v Speaker 4>This billionaire.</v>

1746
00:48:52.440 --> 00:48:53.220
<v Speaker 4>Why don't you?</v>

1747
00:48:53.220 --> 00:48:53.431
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1748
00:48:53.431 --> 00:48:53.731
<v Speaker 4>Where are you?</v>

1749
00:48:53.731 --> 00:48:55.470
<v Speaker 4>The mayor of fucking New York City.</v>

1750
00:48:55.500 --> 00:48:56.370
<v Speaker 4>Like hello?</v>

1751
00:48:56.371 --> 00:48:58.260
<v Speaker 4>You don't know that it's a mess out there.</v>

1752
00:48:58.540 --> 00:48:58.830
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1753
00:48:58.830 --> 00:48:59.750
<v Speaker 4>Occupy a job.</v>

1754
00:48:59.760 --> 00:49:02.340
<v Speaker 4>Did you really fucking silly bitch.</v>

1755
00:49:02.970 --> 00:49:04.270
<v Speaker 4>It just seems that it's,</v>

1756
00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:09.920
<v Speaker 4>it's the sign of the Times that I'm enough people like get together and go.</v>

1757
00:49:10.981 --> 00:49:11.581
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1758
00:49:11.581 --> 00:49:12.001
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1759
00:49:12.001 --> 00:49:15.210
<v Speaker 4>Like if there's enough agreement that you can have this gigantic,</v>

1760
00:49:15.720 --> 00:49:17.700
<v Speaker 4>huge movement without a leader.</v>

1761
00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:20.700
<v Speaker 4>But I think ultimately that's one of the issues with it.</v>

1762
00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:25.620
<v Speaker 4>The non defined structure and non defined leadership position.</v>

1763
00:49:25.860 --> 00:49:26.131
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1764
00:49:26.131 --> 00:49:26.964
<v Speaker 5>It can both be a,</v>

1765
00:49:27.120 --> 00:49:29.750
<v Speaker 5>it can both be a benefit and a detraction.</v>

1766
00:49:29.760 --> 00:49:30.001
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1767
00:49:30.001 --> 00:49:31.350
<v Speaker 5>look at like say for example,</v>

1768
00:49:31.351 --> 00:49:31.951
<v Speaker 5>Wiki leaks.</v>

1769
00:49:31.951 --> 00:49:35.400
<v Speaker 5>It was like they were able to collapse that thing by imprisoning essentially</v>

1770
00:49:35.540 --> 00:49:36.171
<v Speaker 5>Julian assange.</v>

1771
00:49:36.171 --> 00:49:37.004
<v Speaker 5>It's the guy at the top.</v>

1772
00:49:37.170 --> 00:49:38.220
<v Speaker 5>So you take one leader,</v>

1773
00:49:38.221 --> 00:49:39.810
<v Speaker 5>you can cut that head off real easy,</v>

1774
00:49:40.050 --> 00:49:40.711
<v Speaker 5>but if you had,</v>

1775
00:49:40.711 --> 00:49:41.544
<v Speaker 5>let's say,</v>

1776
00:49:41.550 --> 00:49:44.370
<v Speaker 5>a lot of leaders to some degree or a lot of,</v>

1777
00:49:44.371 --> 00:49:44.790
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1778
00:49:44.790 --> 00:49:45.510
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1779
00:49:45.510 --> 00:49:45.840
<v Speaker 5>each,</v>

1780
00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:49.440
<v Speaker 5>each different area elected somebody to kind of run things or whatever.</v>

1781
00:49:49.560 --> 00:49:51.500
<v Speaker 4>Did you see the salon piece on?</v>

1782
00:49:51.501 --> 00:49:51.930
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1783
00:49:51.930 --> 00:49:52.590
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1784
00:49:52.590 --> 00:49:53.570
<v Speaker 4>on there,</v>

1785
00:49:53.580 --> 00:49:54.170
<v Speaker 4>there were,</v>

1786
00:49:54.170 --> 00:49:57.240
<v Speaker 4>there's discussion about offering Edward Snowden,</v>

1787
00:49:57.241 --> 00:50:02.241
<v Speaker 4>amnesty who discussion by who there's certain NSA officials that are considering</v>

1788
00:50:04.021 --> 00:50:05.470
<v Speaker 4>amnesty for Stoughton and there</v>

1789
00:50:05.810 --> 00:50:09.200
<v Speaker 5>proposing because they're really nervous because apparently only one percent of</v>

1790
00:50:09.201 --> 00:50:10.970
<v Speaker 5>what he might have has been put out.</v>

1791
00:50:10.971 --> 00:50:13.130
<v Speaker 5>So there's a lot of stuff they're nervous about coming out.</v>

1792
00:50:13.131 --> 00:50:13.510
<v Speaker 5>So</v>

1793
00:50:13.510 --> 00:50:15.910
<v Speaker 4>State Department Justice Department aren't on board.</v>

1794
00:50:15.911 --> 00:50:16.720
<v Speaker 4>They don't want to do it.</v>

1795
00:50:16.720 --> 00:50:19.150
<v Speaker 4>They think it would encourage the,</v>

1796
00:50:19.151 --> 00:50:19.510
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1797
00:50:19.510 --> 00:50:21.510
<v Speaker 4>future Edwards Rosa.</v>

1798
00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:22.833
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1799
00:50:22.960 --> 00:50:24.070
<v Speaker 4>But man,</v>

1800
00:50:24.330 --> 00:50:24.770
<v Speaker 4>if they're,</v>

1801
00:50:24.770 --> 00:50:26.650
<v Speaker 4>if they're actually saying that though,</v>

1802
00:50:26.690 --> 00:50:26.840
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

1803
00:50:26.840 --> 00:50:28.220
<v Speaker 4>they must be so terrified.</v>

1804
00:50:28.490 --> 00:50:29.180
<v Speaker 5>Terrified,</v>

1805
00:50:29.180 --> 00:50:31.220
<v Speaker 5>and in my opinion that there's a fucking hero.</v>

1806
00:50:31.700 --> 00:50:31.910
<v Speaker 5>He.</v>

1807
00:50:31.910 --> 00:50:32.061
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1808
00:50:32.061 --> 00:50:32.750
<v Speaker 5>he's like,</v>

1809
00:50:32.750 --> 00:50:34.130
<v Speaker 5>he's a digital Paul revere.</v>

1810
00:50:34.900 --> 00:50:35.733
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1811
00:50:35.890 --> 00:50:37.040
<v Speaker 5>people should be furious.</v>

1812
00:50:37.041 --> 00:50:38.270
<v Speaker 5>Know that it's coming like,</v>

1813
00:50:38.271 --> 00:50:39.104
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

1814
00:50:39.110 --> 00:50:41.660
<v Speaker 5>look at what's being done in the enemy.</v>

1815
00:50:41.690 --> 00:50:45.830
<v Speaker 5>The enemy is spying on you all the time and listen whether you love Obama,</v>

1816
00:50:45.850 --> 00:50:46.401
<v Speaker 5>what do you hate?</v>

1817
00:50:46.401 --> 00:50:47.234
<v Speaker 5>Obama.</v>

1818
00:50:47.510 --> 00:50:49.310
<v Speaker 5>This is a dictator's toolkit.</v>

1819
00:50:49.520 --> 00:50:50.270
<v Speaker 5>Whether Obama's,</v>

1820
00:50:50.270 --> 00:50:51.650
<v Speaker 5>let's say Obama wasn't even using it.</v>

1821
00:50:51.880 --> 00:50:54.440
<v Speaker 5>This is a dictator's tool kit for the next dude that gets into office.</v>

1822
00:50:54.760 --> 00:50:55.210
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1823
00:50:55.210 --> 00:50:59.050
<v Speaker 6>and it's the idea that we're supposed to just tolerate that because it's the</v>

1824
00:50:59.051 --> 00:50:59.501
<v Speaker 6>government.</v>

1825
00:50:59.501 --> 00:51:01.510
<v Speaker 6>Like there's a whole reason why there's a constitution.</v>

1826
00:51:01.511 --> 00:51:03.880
<v Speaker 6>There's a whole reason why people are elected into office,</v>

1827
00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:04.370
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1828
00:51:04.370 --> 00:51:07.060
<v Speaker 6>Because they're supposed to represent our state of government.</v>

1829
00:51:07.061 --> 00:51:10.720
<v Speaker 6>They're supposed to represent some really clearly thought out rules that were a</v>

1830
00:51:10.721 --> 00:51:12.550
<v Speaker 6>lot of the times designed to,</v>

1831
00:51:12.850 --> 00:51:13.420
<v Speaker 6>to,</v>

1832
00:51:13.420 --> 00:51:15.610
<v Speaker 6>to factor in the possibility of corruption.</v>

1833
00:51:15.820 --> 00:51:19.390
<v Speaker 6>So they kept out the influence of religion and they kept out the influence of</v>

1834
00:51:19.391 --> 00:51:20.100
<v Speaker 6>corruption.</v>

1835
00:51:20.100 --> 00:51:21.370
<v Speaker 6>There was this all done on purpose.</v>

1836
00:51:21.371 --> 00:51:23.560
<v Speaker 6>It was all like really astutely engineered</v>

1837
00:51:23.640 --> 00:51:24.211
<v Speaker 5>branches,</v>

1838
00:51:24.211 --> 00:51:24.730
<v Speaker 5>all that shit.</v>

1839
00:51:24.730 --> 00:51:28.960
<v Speaker 6>And slowly but surely elected officials just chipped away and all that stuff</v>

1840
00:51:28.961 --> 00:51:29.890
<v Speaker 6>just right in front of us,</v>

1841
00:51:29.891 --> 00:51:32.680
<v Speaker 6>chipped away and everyone was busy paying attention to Kim.</v>

1842
00:51:32.681 --> 00:51:35.470
<v Speaker 6>Kardashians asked and nobody even noticed that it was happening.</v>

1843
00:51:35.880 --> 00:51:38.770
<v Speaker 6>Slowly but surely things at the end day a good pass.</v>

1844
00:51:38.870 --> 00:51:39.010
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1845
00:51:39.010 --> 00:51:39.320
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

1846
00:51:39.320 --> 00:51:40.280
<v Speaker 5>Indefinite detention.</v>

1847
00:51:40.281 --> 00:51:40.370
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1848
00:51:40.370 --> 00:51:42.380
<v Speaker 6>American deaths in detention with not only that,</v>

1849
00:51:42.440 --> 00:51:44.060
<v Speaker 6>you don't have rights to an attorney,</v>

1850
00:51:44.061 --> 00:51:44.894
<v Speaker 6>you don't have.</v>

1851
00:51:44.900 --> 00:51:45.640
<v Speaker 6>It's craziness.</v>

1852
00:51:45.640 --> 00:51:48.110
<v Speaker 6>It's like Soviet Russia type shit.</v>

1853
00:51:48.111 --> 00:51:49.130
<v Speaker 6>This is shit.</v>

1854
00:51:49.160 --> 00:51:50.030
<v Speaker 6>It's like you can't do that.</v>

1855
00:51:50.031 --> 00:51:50.864
<v Speaker 6>This is America</v>

1856
00:51:50.900 --> 00:51:51.250
<v Speaker 5>on,</v>

1857
00:51:51.250 --> 00:51:52.140
<v Speaker 5>on my web series.</v>

1858
00:51:52.141 --> 00:51:52.891
<v Speaker 5>I interviewed,</v>

1859
00:51:52.891 --> 00:51:52.980
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1860
00:51:52.980 --> 00:51:53.611
<v Speaker 5>Chris Hedges,</v>

1861
00:51:53.611 --> 00:51:56.970
<v Speaker 5>who was one of the people taken Obama to court over India.</v>

1862
00:51:57.060 --> 00:51:57.710
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

1863
00:51:57.710 --> 00:51:58.180
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

1864
00:51:58.180 --> 00:51:59.280
<v Speaker 5>they ultimately lost,</v>

1865
00:51:59.281 --> 00:52:02.010
<v Speaker 5>but they scared the shit out of the government that they couldn't use this thing</v>

1866
00:52:02.011 --> 00:52:04.440
<v Speaker 5>where they imprison people without a trial or charges.</v>

1867
00:52:04.441 --> 00:52:05.050
<v Speaker 5>It's insane.</v>

1868
00:52:05.050 --> 00:52:06.790
<v Speaker 6>It's so crazy that you would want to do that.</v>

1869
00:52:07.180 --> 00:52:07.520
<v Speaker 6>Why?</v>

1870
00:52:07.520 --> 00:52:11.170
<v Speaker 6>Why would you want to go around all of our checks and balances that are in place</v>

1871
00:52:11.171 --> 00:52:13.660
<v Speaker 6>to ensure that people that are being tried or actually guilty?</v>

1872
00:52:14.020 --> 00:52:15.070
<v Speaker 6>Why would you want to do that?</v>

1873
00:52:15.130 --> 00:52:16.300
<v Speaker 6>The only reason why you'd want to do that,</v>

1874
00:52:16.301 --> 00:52:19.270
<v Speaker 6>if you want to use that power to imprison people for your own whims,</v>

1875
00:52:19.540 --> 00:52:20.810
<v Speaker 6>for your own decisions because you,</v>

1876
00:52:20.811 --> 00:52:22.100
<v Speaker 6>you decided this guy's a,</v>

1877
00:52:22.101 --> 00:52:22.340
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1878
00:52:22.340 --> 00:52:22.690
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1879
00:52:22.690 --> 00:52:23.740
<v Speaker 6>an enemy of your,</v>

1880
00:52:24.060 --> 00:52:24.430
<v Speaker 6>your,</v>

1881
00:52:24.430 --> 00:52:25.210
<v Speaker 6>your cabinet,</v>

1882
00:52:25.210 --> 00:52:27.640
<v Speaker 6>whatever the fuck you decide when you want that guy.</v>

1883
00:52:27.641 --> 00:52:27.900
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1884
00:52:27.900 --> 00:52:28.620
<v Speaker 5>Demonized.</v>

1885
00:52:28.620 --> 00:52:28.990
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

1886
00:52:28.990 --> 00:52:29.330
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

1887
00:52:29.330 --> 00:52:29.790
<v Speaker 5>and you know,</v>

1888
00:52:29.790 --> 00:52:31.000
<v Speaker 5>same idea with Americans.</v>

1889
00:52:31.020 --> 00:52:34.500
<v Speaker 5>He's got Americans on his kill list and Eric holder was asked,</v>

1890
00:52:34.501 --> 00:52:34.831
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

1891
00:52:34.831 --> 00:52:37.920
<v Speaker 5>what would you ever take out an American on American soil?</v>

1892
00:52:38.130 --> 00:52:39.120
<v Speaker 5>And his response was,</v>

1893
00:52:39.180 --> 00:52:41.690
<v Speaker 5>it would have to be a really bad thing going on.</v>

1894
00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:42.070
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

1895
00:52:42.070 --> 00:52:42.450
<v Speaker 5>you're like,</v>

1896
00:52:42.450 --> 00:52:43.350
<v Speaker 5>so you said yes,</v>

1897
00:52:43.410 --> 00:52:46.350
<v Speaker 5>you would take out an American on American soil.</v>

1898
00:52:46.550 --> 00:52:48.300
<v Speaker 5>Like it's insanity.</v>

1899
00:52:48.360 --> 00:52:48.481
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1900
00:52:48.481 --> 00:52:49.560
<v Speaker 5>they were considering doing that.</v>

1901
00:52:49.590 --> 00:52:50.460
<v Speaker 5>Christopher dormer,</v>

1902
00:52:50.520 --> 00:52:51.353
<v Speaker 5>do you remember that?</v>

1903
00:52:51.450 --> 00:52:53.320
<v Speaker 5>Christopher dormer was the cop</v>

1904
00:52:54.270 --> 00:52:54.960
<v Speaker 6>killed,</v>

1905
00:52:54.960 --> 00:52:56.880
<v Speaker 6>killed a family of police officers,</v>

1906
00:52:56.881 --> 00:52:58.890
<v Speaker 6>killed police officers and killed a bunch of people.</v>

1907
00:52:58.891 --> 00:53:03.891
<v Speaker 6>And then there was talk in the news and a bunch different newspaper articles</v>

1908
00:53:04.201 --> 00:53:07.920
<v Speaker 6>that I read would that he might be the very first domestic use of the drone for</v>

1909
00:53:07.921 --> 00:53:09.190
<v Speaker 6>combat and they might.</v>

1910
00:53:09.820 --> 00:53:10.091
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>

1911
00:53:10.091 --> 00:53:12.610
<v Speaker 5>Imagine fucking death for the sky,</v>

1912
00:53:12.611 --> 00:53:13.060
<v Speaker 5>bitch,</v>

1913
00:53:13.060 --> 00:53:14.710
<v Speaker 5>take out the whole neighborhood again,</v>

1914
00:53:14.770 --> 00:53:16.270
<v Speaker 5>shoot a gang of cops in their family.</v>

1915
00:53:16.400 --> 00:53:18.550
<v Speaker 5>They're going to shoot missiles at you from the air.</v>

1916
00:53:20.500 --> 00:53:21.333
<v Speaker 6>We have A.</v>

1917
00:53:21.340 --> 00:53:24.400
<v Speaker 6>There's a big disparity between the capabilities of the average American</v>

1918
00:53:24.401 --> 00:53:24.940
<v Speaker 6>citizen,</v>

1919
00:53:24.940 --> 00:53:28.440
<v Speaker 6>the human being and the government that runs these average human beings,</v>

1920
00:53:28.620 --> 00:53:30.570
<v Speaker 6>and whenever you have an imbalance of power,</v>

1921
00:53:30.571 --> 00:53:33.210
<v Speaker 6>you're going to have abuse because people are going to want to have some of that</v>

1922
00:53:33.211 --> 00:53:33.601
<v Speaker 6>power.</v>

1923
00:53:33.601 --> 00:53:34.530
<v Speaker 6>They're gonna want to have a taste?</v>

1924
00:53:34.531 --> 00:53:37.740
<v Speaker 6>You got to keep them down in order to enjoy this position that you're in.</v>

1925
00:53:37.950 --> 00:53:39.240
<v Speaker 6>You've got to fucking make some.</v>

1926
00:53:39.270 --> 00:53:41.640
<v Speaker 6>Make some decisions and be tough on people.</v>

1927
00:53:41.641 --> 00:53:42.660
<v Speaker 6>And I'm looking at your email,</v>

1928
00:53:42.661 --> 00:53:42.871
<v Speaker 6>bitch,</v>

1929
00:53:42.871 --> 00:53:43.704
<v Speaker 6>how about that?</v>

1930
00:53:43.800 --> 00:53:44.071
<v Speaker 6>I'll,</v>

1931
00:53:44.071 --> 00:53:44.340
<v Speaker 6>I'll,</v>

1932
00:53:44.340 --> 00:53:44.580
<v Speaker 6>I'll,</v>

1933
00:53:44.580 --> 00:53:47.320
<v Speaker 6>I'll monitor every single one of your calls because I want to make sure you know</v>

1934
00:53:47.321 --> 00:53:47.821
<v Speaker 6>a terrorist.</v>

1935
00:53:47.821 --> 00:53:48.370
<v Speaker 6>Okay?</v>

1936
00:53:48.370 --> 00:53:51.960
<v Speaker 6>But meanwhile you're just Bob Smith who got elected to office and decided to</v>

1937
00:53:51.961 --> 00:53:53.730
<v Speaker 6>change the entire rules for running the government.</v>

1938
00:53:53.910 --> 00:53:55.920
<v Speaker 6>Like they're not like monks.</v>

1939
00:53:55.921 --> 00:53:58.850
<v Speaker 6>They're not like these guys who have meditated for 20 years on a mountain and</v>

1940
00:53:58.851 --> 00:54:01.860
<v Speaker 6>achieved enlightenment and then became the perfect leaders for our society,</v>

1941
00:54:02.070 --> 00:54:03.840
<v Speaker 6>but regular guys with stupid shoes,</v>

1942
00:54:04.080 --> 00:54:06.210
<v Speaker 6>with those slippery bottom shoes,</v>

1943
00:54:06.211 --> 00:54:07.170
<v Speaker 6>with tassels,</v>

1944
00:54:08.040 --> 00:54:08.940
<v Speaker 6>fucking Weirdos.</v>

1945
00:54:08.941 --> 00:54:09.670
<v Speaker 6>These guys,</v>

1946
00:54:09.670 --> 00:54:13.770
<v Speaker 5>the regular rich dudes that are abusing their power and people should be fucking</v>

1947
00:54:13.771 --> 00:54:14.551
<v Speaker 5>furious about this.</v>

1948
00:54:14.551 --> 00:54:16.020
<v Speaker 5>I don't understand why there's not</v>

1949
00:54:16.130 --> 00:54:17.990
<v Speaker 6>more outrage because we don't feel it.</v>

1950
00:54:18.340 --> 00:54:19.400
<v Speaker 6>That's a very good friend.</v>

1951
00:54:19.430 --> 00:54:20.290
<v Speaker 6>He's a very good friend.</v>

1952
00:54:20.310 --> 00:54:21.141
<v Speaker 6>He's a very nice guy.</v>

1953
00:54:21.141 --> 00:54:21.830
<v Speaker 6>He's a writer.</v>

1954
00:54:21.830 --> 00:54:22.880
<v Speaker 6>He's very smart,</v>

1955
00:54:23.150 --> 00:54:23.870
<v Speaker 6>and he said,</v>

1956
00:54:23.870 --> 00:54:24.200
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

1957
00:54:24.200 --> 00:54:24.561
<v Speaker 6>you know what,</v>

1958
00:54:24.561 --> 00:54:24.831
<v Speaker 6>man?</v>

1959
00:54:24.831 --> 00:54:25.664
<v Speaker 6>I don't feel it.</v>

1960
00:54:25.750 --> 00:54:26.960
<v Speaker 6>I'm looking around at my friends.</v>

1961
00:54:26.961 --> 00:54:27.860
<v Speaker 6>They're doing good.</v>

1962
00:54:27.861 --> 00:54:29.090
<v Speaker 6>I'm looking at a lot of my family.</v>

1963
00:54:29.091 --> 00:54:29.720
<v Speaker 6>They're going good.</v>

1964
00:54:29.720 --> 00:54:29.961
<v Speaker 6>I go,</v>

1965
00:54:29.961 --> 00:54:30.794
<v Speaker 6>oh my God,</v>

1966
00:54:31.090 --> 00:54:31.910
<v Speaker 6>that is the car.</v>

1967
00:54:31.910 --> 00:54:35.510
<v Speaker 6>That's like saying that if you in a sunny field somewhere in Kansas,</v>

1968
00:54:35.511 --> 00:54:37.760
<v Speaker 6>you can't believe that Pakistan has a tornado.</v>

1969
00:54:38.010 --> 00:54:38.843
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

1970
00:54:38.870 --> 00:54:41.660
<v Speaker 6>This is one of the dumbest things I've ever heard and you can't imagine it might</v>

1971
00:54:41.661 --> 00:54:42.890
<v Speaker 6>come back to you eventually.</v>

1972
00:54:43.020 --> 00:54:43.190
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1973
00:54:43.190 --> 00:54:45.590
<v Speaker 6>The idea that like you're doing good and your friends are doing good,</v>

1974
00:54:45.591 --> 00:54:47.420
<v Speaker 6>so there's not that much corruption,</v>

1975
00:54:47.421 --> 00:54:48.620
<v Speaker 6>like it's not like it's.</v>

1976
00:54:48.770 --> 00:54:52.790
<v Speaker 6>These are rumors like all this stuff is admitted it.</v>

1977
00:54:52.791 --> 00:54:53.690
<v Speaker 6>Everyone admitted it</v>

1978
00:54:53.920 --> 00:54:56.950
<v Speaker 5>and every time you know and people will stand up for certain things.</v>

1979
00:54:56.951 --> 00:54:59.260
<v Speaker 5>Every time they try and pass some gun legislation.</v>

1980
00:54:59.261 --> 00:55:00.100
<v Speaker 5>People get furious.</v>

1981
00:55:00.101 --> 00:55:00.490
<v Speaker 5>All right,</v>

1982
00:55:00.490 --> 00:55:00.790
<v Speaker 5>and I,</v>

1983
00:55:00.790 --> 00:55:03.040
<v Speaker 5>and I'm not talking about whether you should have guns or not,</v>

1984
00:55:03.190 --> 00:55:06.370
<v Speaker 5>but the people who stand up for that stuff should also stand up against this</v>

1985
00:55:06.371 --> 00:55:10.570
<v Speaker 5>other stuff because all those things you have your gun for to protect your</v>

1986
00:55:10.571 --> 00:55:10.940
<v Speaker 5>freedom,</v>

1987
00:55:10.940 --> 00:55:11.531
<v Speaker 5>your family,</v>

1988
00:55:11.531 --> 00:55:12.160
<v Speaker 5>a property,</v>

1989
00:55:12.160 --> 00:55:15.430
<v Speaker 5>they're taking that by other means there your freedom's gone.</v>

1990
00:55:15.431 --> 00:55:16.330
<v Speaker 5>The reading your emails,</v>

1991
00:55:16.331 --> 00:55:18.160
<v Speaker 5>you can be locked away without a trial or charges.</v>

1992
00:55:18.161 --> 00:55:21.970
<v Speaker 5>Your family's indebted to student loans and we'll end up at some job they hate</v>

1993
00:55:21.971 --> 00:55:24.160
<v Speaker 5>because they're paying that shit off the rest of their lives.</v>

1994
00:55:24.340 --> 00:55:25.230
<v Speaker 5>You know half your shift,</v>

1995
00:55:25.590 --> 00:55:27.100
<v Speaker 5>your houses foreclosed on,</v>

1996
00:55:27.230 --> 00:55:30.770
<v Speaker 6>all that shit you want to protect with a gun they'd taken without guns.</v>

1997
00:55:31.050 --> 00:55:31.670
<v Speaker 6>Why?</v>

1998
00:55:31.670 --> 00:55:32.331
<v Speaker 6>Fox News?</v>

1999
00:55:32.331 --> 00:55:32.601
<v Speaker 6>Chicks.</v>

2000
00:55:32.601 --> 00:55:33.434
<v Speaker 6>They're too.</v>

2001
00:55:34.090 --> 00:55:34.970
<v Speaker 6>They're too hot.</v>

2002
00:55:34.971 --> 00:55:36.440
<v Speaker 6>You want to just make them happy.</v>

2003
00:55:37.480 --> 00:55:38.180
<v Speaker 6>You want it.</v>

2004
00:55:38.180 --> 00:55:39.080
<v Speaker 6>You want to just tell them,</v>

2005
00:55:39.081 --> 00:55:39.321
<v Speaker 6>hey,</v>

2006
00:55:39.321 --> 00:55:40.250
<v Speaker 6>I'm a hunter.</v>

2007
00:55:40.251 --> 00:55:41.390
<v Speaker 6>I'm a fisherman.</v>

2008
00:55:41.391 --> 00:55:42.111
<v Speaker 6>Outdoorsman.</v>

2009
00:55:42.111 --> 00:55:42.320
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

2010
00:55:42.320 --> 00:55:44.390
<v Speaker 6>I think everyone should be able to carry a concealed weapon.</v>

2011
00:55:44.870 --> 00:55:45.681
<v Speaker 6>This is America.</v>

2012
00:55:45.681 --> 00:55:46.514
<v Speaker 6>God Damn it.</v>

2013
00:55:46.930 --> 00:55:47.360
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2014
00:55:47.360 --> 00:55:47.620
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2015
00:55:47.620 --> 00:55:49.130
<v Speaker 6>We have obamacare.</v>

2016
00:55:49.160 --> 00:55:49.730
<v Speaker 6>Come on,</v>

2017
00:55:49.730 --> 00:55:50.563
<v Speaker 6>get on with it.</v>

2018
00:55:50.760 --> 00:55:51.140
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

2019
00:55:51.140 --> 00:55:52.730
<v Speaker 6>what is even trying to prove with that?</v>

2020
00:55:53.180 --> 00:55:53.390
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

2021
00:55:53.390 --> 00:55:54.050
<v Speaker 6>there's a reason.</v>

2022
00:55:54.050 --> 00:55:54.261
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2023
00:55:54.261 --> 00:55:54.790
<v Speaker 5>we need to fill.</v>

2024
00:55:54.790 --> 00:55:56.300
<v Speaker 5>We need to fix our healthcare system,</v>

2025
00:55:56.301 --> 00:55:59.370
<v Speaker 5>but unfortunately the way he did it was by basically saying no,</v>

2026
00:55:59.390 --> 00:56:01.760
<v Speaker 5>the insurance companies could go nuts.</v>

2027
00:56:01.890 --> 00:56:02.161
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2028
00:56:02.161 --> 00:56:04.110
<v Speaker 6>I think what happened is he wanted to do something.</v>

2029
00:56:04.140 --> 00:56:05.990
<v Speaker 6>I mean this is a total optimist.</v>

2030
00:56:06.030 --> 00:56:10.080
<v Speaker 6>Guess that he wanted to do something good and then the only way he was able to</v>

2031
00:56:10.081 --> 00:56:14.970
<v Speaker 6>pull it off at all was to make it some sort of a county shell game with the</v>

2032
00:56:14.971 --> 00:56:16.920
<v Speaker 6>insurance companies actually profit off of it,</v>

2033
00:56:17.190 --> 00:56:19.800
<v Speaker 6>but ultimately everybody does get some sort of healthcare.</v>

2034
00:56:20.220 --> 00:56:21.230
<v Speaker 6>I think healthcare,</v>

2035
00:56:21.240 --> 00:56:26.240
<v Speaker 6>I mean this is one thing that I fully believe in healthcare and police and like</v>

2036
00:56:26.440 --> 00:56:31.440
<v Speaker 6>cleaning the streets and disposing of waste and all that stuff should be taken</v>

2037
00:56:32.441 --> 00:56:35.080
<v Speaker 6>care of by any logical healthy society.</v>

2038
00:56:35.200 --> 00:56:35.910
<v Speaker 6>First,</v>

2039
00:56:35.910 --> 00:56:36.790
<v Speaker 6>education,</v>

2040
00:56:37.060 --> 00:56:37.721
<v Speaker 6>education,</v>

2041
00:56:37.721 --> 00:56:38.230
<v Speaker 6>health,</v>

2042
00:56:38.230 --> 00:56:39.063
<v Speaker 6>safety,</v>

2043
00:56:39.250 --> 00:56:39.910
<v Speaker 6>cleanliness,</v>

2044
00:56:39.910 --> 00:56:40.360
<v Speaker 6>all that.</v>

2045
00:56:40.360 --> 00:56:41.770
<v Speaker 6>Primarily that's primary.</v>

2046
00:56:41.950 --> 00:56:42.783
<v Speaker 6>After that,</v>

2047
00:56:42.850 --> 00:56:45.490
<v Speaker 6>let's worry about Janet Jackson's nipple on television.</v>

2048
00:56:46.470 --> 00:56:47.303
<v Speaker 6>After that,</v>

2049
00:56:47.320 --> 00:56:50.290
<v Speaker 6>let's worry about all these other things like the idea that people should have</v>

2050
00:56:50.291 --> 00:56:52.030
<v Speaker 6>to pay for their own healthcare and like,</v>

2051
00:56:52.300 --> 00:56:52.870
<v Speaker 6>look man,</v>

2052
00:56:52.870 --> 00:56:54.790
<v Speaker 5>I've been at the point of being in a society.</v>

2053
00:56:54.791 --> 00:56:55.624
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>

2054
00:56:56.240 --> 00:56:57.021
<v Speaker 5>We can use our money,</v>

2055
00:56:57.021 --> 00:56:57.140
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2056
00:56:57.140 --> 00:56:59.060
<v Speaker 6>Pay Doctors and the doctor should be paid well,</v>

2057
00:56:59.061 --> 00:56:59.690
<v Speaker 6>by the way,</v>

2058
00:56:59.690 --> 00:57:02.560
<v Speaker 6>the big problem with doctors in these situations is that the,</v>

2059
00:57:02.561 --> 00:57:03.890
<v Speaker 6>the doctors always get fucked.</v>

2060
00:57:03.891 --> 00:57:07.130
<v Speaker 6>They have massive malpractice insurance and huge student loans.</v>

2061
00:57:07.131 --> 00:57:07.970
<v Speaker 6>They have to pay off.</v>

2062
00:57:08.380 --> 00:57:11.310
<v Speaker 5>When I go to a doctor now they're afraid to say anything because they,</v>

2063
00:57:11.340 --> 00:57:12.040
<v Speaker 5>they think,</v>

2064
00:57:12.040 --> 00:57:12.431
<v Speaker 5>oh well,</v>

2065
00:57:12.431 --> 00:57:13.290
<v Speaker 5>it might come back to me.</v>

2066
00:57:13.300 --> 00:57:13.691
<v Speaker 5>So they say,</v>

2067
00:57:13.691 --> 00:57:14.051
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2068
00:57:14.051 --> 00:57:15.340
<v Speaker 5>it could be this thing.</v>

2069
00:57:15.680 --> 00:57:17.040
<v Speaker 5>It might not be in my.</v>

2070
00:57:17.190 --> 00:57:17.900
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

2071
00:57:17.900 --> 00:57:18.431
<v Speaker 5>You're like,</v>

2072
00:57:18.431 --> 00:57:18.581
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

2073
00:57:18.581 --> 00:57:19.201
<v Speaker 5>I stubbed my toe,</v>

2074
00:57:19.201 --> 00:57:19.841
<v Speaker 5>do I have cancer?</v>

2075
00:57:19.841 --> 00:57:20.350
<v Speaker 5>And he was like,</v>

2076
00:57:20.350 --> 00:57:24.130
<v Speaker 5>probably not because they don't want to say you don't have cancer because then</v>

2077
00:57:24.131 --> 00:57:25.000
<v Speaker 5>if you have cancer,</v>

2078
00:57:25.001 --> 00:57:25.691
<v Speaker 5>they're fucked.</v>

2079
00:57:25.691 --> 00:57:25.991
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2080
00:57:25.991 --> 00:57:27.220
<v Speaker 5>Then you'd sue them because.</v>

2081
00:57:27.700 --> 00:57:28.070
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

2082
00:57:28.070 --> 00:57:29.690
<v Speaker 6>About your cancer and Jesus Christ.</v>

2083
00:57:29.990 --> 00:57:34.910
<v Speaker 6>But I think that there should be a bunch of well motivated,</v>

2084
00:57:34.960 --> 00:57:39.580
<v Speaker 6>well paid doctors and teachers and policemen that should be taken care of right</v>

2085
00:57:39.590 --> 00:57:43.700
<v Speaker 6>away and they're going to change the idea of the role of a policeman and the</v>

2086
00:57:43.701 --> 00:57:44.900
<v Speaker 6>idea of the role of a teacher.</v>

2087
00:57:45.050 --> 00:57:46.190
<v Speaker 6>They should be noble position.</v>

2088
00:57:46.270 --> 00:57:46.921
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

2089
00:57:46.921 --> 00:57:47.290
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2090
00:57:47.290 --> 00:57:48.740
<v Speaker 5>We shouldn't only give I,</v>

2091
00:57:48.760 --> 00:57:49.181
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2092
00:57:49.181 --> 00:57:52.810
<v Speaker 5>we get perks in society to celebrities like tables at restaurants and things</v>

2093
00:57:52.811 --> 00:57:53.170
<v Speaker 5>like that.</v>

2094
00:57:53.170 --> 00:57:56.020
<v Speaker 5>I think like the best teachers in the country should be able to like,</v>

2095
00:57:56.100 --> 00:57:56.710
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2096
00:57:56.710 --> 00:58:00.160
<v Speaker 5>have a fuck a 14 year old every once while not get in trouble.</v>

2097
00:58:00.190 --> 00:58:01.023
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2098
00:58:01.440 --> 00:58:02.040
<v Speaker 5>Fourteen year old</v>

2099
00:58:02.040 --> 00:58:03.120
<v Speaker 6>boy and it's a girl.</v>

2100
00:58:03.240 --> 00:58:04.850
<v Speaker 6>It's Fox News checks.</v>

2101
00:58:04.870 --> 00:58:05.760
<v Speaker 6>That's a joke.</v>

2102
00:58:05.820 --> 00:58:06.540
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2103
00:58:06.540 --> 00:58:08.190
<v Speaker 6>How dare you busted joke out about that.</v>

2104
00:58:08.450 --> 00:58:09.180
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

2105
00:58:09.180 --> 00:58:10.650
<v Speaker 6>do you think that there's.</v>

2106
00:58:10.740 --> 00:58:11.670
<v Speaker 6>What are you showing more?</v>

2107
00:58:12.630 --> 00:58:13.371
<v Speaker 6>Oh my God.</v>

2108
00:58:13.371 --> 00:58:14.720
<v Speaker 6>She's putting on a God damn show.</v>

2109
00:58:15.300 --> 00:58:15.541
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

2110
00:58:15.541 --> 00:58:16.680
<v Speaker 6>she's got it down to a science.</v>

2111
00:58:16.740 --> 00:58:18.420
<v Speaker 6>She knows exactly what that lends is.</v>

2112
00:58:18.810 --> 00:58:19.643
<v Speaker 6>She's Melfi.</v>

2113
00:58:19.860 --> 00:58:20.693
<v Speaker 6>She's very Melfi.</v>

2114
00:58:22.020 --> 00:58:22.853
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2115
00:58:22.860 --> 00:58:23.311
<v Speaker 6>Those girls,</v>

2116
00:58:23.311 --> 00:58:24.780
<v Speaker 6>you get them alone to go crazy on you.</v>

2117
00:58:25.700 --> 00:58:26.533
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

2118
00:58:26.610 --> 00:58:27.750
<v Speaker 6>I forgot what I was going to talk about.</v>

2119
00:58:29.280 --> 00:58:29.670
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

2120
00:58:29.670 --> 00:58:30.503
<v Speaker 6>I don't.</v>

2121
00:58:30.750 --> 00:58:31.583
<v Speaker 6>She scares me.</v>

2122
00:58:34.290 --> 00:58:35.123
<v Speaker 6>I'm lucky.</v>

2123
00:58:35.490 --> 00:58:35.941
<v Speaker 6>I'm lucky.</v>

2124
00:58:35.941 --> 00:58:36.774
<v Speaker 6>I'm happy.</v>

2125
00:58:37.330 --> 00:58:38.040
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

2126
00:58:38.040 --> 00:58:41.370
<v Speaker 6>did you see that video on my feet at this fucking idiot putting his arm in a</v>

2127
00:58:41.371 --> 00:58:42.870
<v Speaker 6>tiger's mouth is playing with a tiger.</v>

2128
00:58:44.280 --> 00:58:45.150
<v Speaker 6>Go back to,</v>

2129
00:58:45.151 --> 00:58:45.984
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2130
00:58:47.160 --> 00:58:50.760
<v Speaker 6>go on my feet about nine hours ago on my twitter feed is the most ridiculous</v>

2131
00:58:50.761 --> 00:58:51.594
<v Speaker 6>thing ever.</v>

2132
00:58:53.250 --> 00:58:56.520
<v Speaker 6>I can't believe this guy was willing to do this and just hopes that this tiger</v>

2133
00:58:56.521 --> 00:58:58.320
<v Speaker 6>plays plays along with them.</v>

2134
00:58:58.620 --> 00:59:01.650
<v Speaker 6>It's so hard to watch the Tigers biting his arm.</v>

2135
00:59:01.651 --> 00:59:06.480
<v Speaker 6>Like it has this entire arm and its mouth and it's got these huge giant teeth.</v>

2136
00:59:06.780 --> 00:59:07.920
<v Speaker 6>See if he gets spread that out.</v>

2137
00:59:08.430 --> 00:59:09.111
<v Speaker 6>Where was he?</v>

2138
00:59:09.111 --> 00:59:10.080
<v Speaker 6>That he had a tiger?</v>

2139
00:59:10.140 --> 00:59:10.621
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>

2140
00:59:10.621 --> 00:59:11.610
<v Speaker 6>I think he's a trainer,</v>

2141
00:59:11.730 --> 00:59:13.140
<v Speaker 6>but look at this crazy ass hole.</v>

2142
00:59:13.200 --> 00:59:13.831
<v Speaker 6>Oh my God.</v>

2143
00:59:13.831 --> 00:59:16.170
<v Speaker 6>This tiger is literally biting his whole arm.</v>

2144
00:59:16.890 --> 00:59:17.970
<v Speaker 6>It's so big.</v>

2145
00:59:18.090 --> 00:59:19.080
<v Speaker 6>That head is so big.</v>

2146
00:59:19.081 --> 00:59:20.310
<v Speaker 6>It would just snap his arm.</v>

2147
00:59:20.311 --> 00:59:20.640
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

2148
00:59:20.640 --> 00:59:21.110
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

2149
00:59:21.110 --> 00:59:24.470
<v Speaker 6>anytime it wants to and he's just sticking it in there and look at the dog.</v>

2150
00:59:24.680 --> 00:59:27.210
<v Speaker 6>How about that dog that's circling the situation?</v>

2151
00:59:27.240 --> 00:59:27.531
<v Speaker 6>He's like,</v>

2152
00:59:27.531 --> 00:59:29.210
<v Speaker 6>what the fuck is that?</v>

2153
00:59:29.540 --> 00:59:30.410
<v Speaker 6>Did you see the dog?</v>

2154
00:59:31.480 --> 00:59:32.450
<v Speaker 4>That poor dog is like,</v>

2155
00:59:32.900 --> 00:59:37.670
<v Speaker 4>maybe he fills up the dog doesn't know what the fuck to do the dog.</v>

2156
00:59:37.680 --> 00:59:37.911
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

2157
00:59:37.911 --> 00:59:38.121
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

2158
00:59:38.121 --> 00:59:39.770
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck is that?</v>

2159
00:59:40.190 --> 00:59:40.690
<v Speaker 4>The dog,</v>

2160
00:59:40.690 --> 00:59:44.840
<v Speaker 4>the tire gets filled up on dogs and then doesn't need the human and the dog</v>

2161
00:59:44.841 --> 00:59:45.830
<v Speaker 4>doesn't know what the fuck to do.</v>

2162
00:59:46.150 --> 00:59:47.040
<v Speaker 4>He's not going to protect you.</v>

2163
00:59:47.080 --> 00:59:49.340
<v Speaker 4>Did you see the guy that sleeps with a tiger?</v>

2164
00:59:49.430 --> 00:59:51.050
<v Speaker 4>And like dogs like this,</v>

2165
00:59:51.110 --> 00:59:52.040
<v Speaker 4>like this tiger is just like,</v>

2166
00:59:52.041 --> 00:59:52.341
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

2167
00:59:52.341 --> 00:59:53.174
<v Speaker 4>I'm just hanging out.</v>

2168
00:59:53.200 --> 00:59:53.411
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2169
00:59:53.411 --> 00:59:55.480
<v Speaker 6>these people are assholes.</v>

2170
00:59:55.690 --> 00:59:56.740
<v Speaker 6>These people are assholes.</v>

2171
00:59:56.860 --> 00:59:57.610
<v Speaker 6>You know why?</v>

2172
00:59:57.610 --> 00:59:59.530
<v Speaker 6>Because they encourage other people to do this too.</v>

2173
00:59:59.770 --> 01:00:01.690
<v Speaker 6>And maybe you can pull it off.</v>

2174
01:00:01.720 --> 01:00:04.510
<v Speaker 6>Maybe you have this incredible rapport with tigers,</v>

2175
01:00:05.050 --> 01:00:09.010
<v Speaker 6>but this idea that we're supposed to do a lot of really dangerous shit with big,</v>

2176
01:00:09.011 --> 01:00:09.431
<v Speaker 6>wild,</v>

2177
01:00:09.431 --> 01:00:12.370
<v Speaker 6>dangerous animals is so fucking stupid.</v>

2178
01:00:12.740 --> 01:00:15.650
<v Speaker 4>You just shouldn't be surprised when that duty.</v>

2179
01:00:15.651 --> 01:00:16.490
<v Speaker 4>It's that guy.</v>

2180
01:00:16.570 --> 01:00:16.721
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

2181
01:00:16.721 --> 01:00:19.120
<v Speaker 6>we played a video last week of this train.</v>

2182
01:00:19.121 --> 01:00:21.550
<v Speaker 6>Bear attacking the trainers.</v>

2183
01:00:21.610 --> 01:00:22.900
<v Speaker 6>I think it was a train is one of the trainers,</v>

2184
01:00:22.901 --> 01:00:24.430
<v Speaker 6>relatives like his brother or something like that.</v>

2185
01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:26.370
<v Speaker 6>This bear just got to nowhere.</v>

2186
01:00:26.380 --> 01:00:29.030
<v Speaker 6>I just decided to rip his throat out there doing these,</v>

2187
01:00:29.060 --> 01:00:29.910
<v Speaker 6>these things there.</v>

2188
01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:31.450
<v Speaker 6>They're training them.</v>

2189
01:00:31.630 --> 01:00:32.770
<v Speaker 6>The guys just standing there.</v>

2190
01:00:32.771 --> 01:00:35.050
<v Speaker 6>The guy's not threatening the bear at all and the bear says,</v>

2191
01:00:35.051 --> 01:00:35.884
<v Speaker 6>you know what,</v>

2192
01:00:36.130 --> 01:00:37.570
<v Speaker 6>I'm just going to fuck this dude up real quick.</v>

2193
01:00:37.630 --> 01:00:39.510
<v Speaker 6>Just attached rips them apart.</v>

2194
01:00:40.120 --> 01:00:43.180
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it was when you tried to put them on the tricycle and he decided he'd had</v>

2195
01:00:43.181 --> 01:00:43.590
<v Speaker 4>enough.</v>

2196
01:00:43.590 --> 01:00:46.530
<v Speaker 6>Did you ever see that video where the bear eats the monkey?</v>

2197
01:00:46.660 --> 01:00:47.370
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>

2198
01:00:47.370 --> 01:00:48.120
<v Speaker 6>Oh my God.</v>

2199
01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:49.800
<v Speaker 6>It's a Russian circus bear.</v>

2200
01:00:49.801 --> 01:00:50.371
<v Speaker 6>Pull that shit out.</v>

2201
01:00:50.371 --> 01:00:53.440
<v Speaker 6>Brian Russian circus bear attacks monkey there.</v>

2202
01:00:53.460 --> 01:00:56.790
<v Speaker 6>There was a monkey driving a bike and the bear was driving a bike and they</v>

2203
01:00:56.791 --> 01:00:59.230
<v Speaker 6>collided the monkey foul and the bear ran over the monkey.</v>

2204
01:00:59.231 --> 01:00:59.800
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2205
01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:04.800
<v Speaker 4>Atacheo kids watching at a circus and the bear just decided to fuck that monkey</v>

2206
01:01:06.191 --> 01:01:07.700
<v Speaker 4>up because the bear didn't know.</v>

2207
01:01:07.840 --> 01:01:09.840
<v Speaker 4>I thought it was being attacked by the monkey to do.</v>

2208
01:01:09.850 --> 01:01:10.683
<v Speaker 4>Not that smart.</v>

2209
01:01:10.870 --> 01:01:11.703
<v Speaker 4>They're in pain.</v>

2210
01:01:11.770 --> 01:01:12.550
<v Speaker 4>They fell.</v>

2211
01:01:12.550 --> 01:01:13.420
<v Speaker 4>They see the monkey,</v>

2212
01:01:13.570 --> 01:01:13.921
<v Speaker 4>the preacher.</v>

2213
01:01:13.921 --> 01:01:14.890
<v Speaker 4>That monkey caused this,</v>

2214
01:01:14.980 --> 01:01:17.140
<v Speaker 4>so they just bid bites the shit out of this monkey.</v>

2215
01:01:17.380 --> 01:01:18.400
<v Speaker 4>During Shakespeare's time,</v>

2216
01:01:18.401 --> 01:01:23.320
<v Speaker 4>one of the most popular shows was a monkey riding a horse and then a bear would</v>

2217
01:01:23.321 --> 01:01:26.110
<v Speaker 4>try and like eat the monkey or whatever it was called.</v>

2218
01:01:26.140 --> 01:01:28.960
<v Speaker 4>It was called bear baiting and Oh my God,</v>

2219
01:01:28.990 --> 01:01:29.980
<v Speaker 4>they fucking loved it.</v>

2220
01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:30.890
<v Speaker 4>I've heard of it.</v>

2221
01:01:30.890 --> 01:01:32.270
<v Speaker 6>Bear baiting and other ways.</v>

2222
01:01:32.271 --> 01:01:34.400
<v Speaker 6>I've heard a one bear baiting thing.</v>

2223
01:01:34.401 --> 01:01:38.750
<v Speaker 6>Would they take a pit bulls and they would tie the bear down by chains.</v>

2224
01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:41.990
<v Speaker 6>Then release the dogs on him and see how many dogs it took to take down a bear.</v>

2225
01:01:42.870 --> 01:01:45.300
<v Speaker 4>The bear is frustrated because he was losing to I think,</v>

2226
01:01:45.650 --> 01:01:47.280
<v Speaker 4>but I don't think there's a competitive,</v>

2227
01:01:49.370 --> 01:01:51.090
<v Speaker 4>like watch the monkey falls in the bear,</v>

2228
01:01:51.091 --> 01:01:52.140
<v Speaker 4>falls on the monkey,</v>

2229
01:01:52.170 --> 01:01:52.921
<v Speaker 4>and he's like bitch.</v>

2230
01:01:52.921 --> 01:01:54.090
<v Speaker 4>And just attacks him.</v>

2231
01:01:54.180 --> 01:01:54.331
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2232
01:01:54.331 --> 01:01:56.790
<v Speaker 4>so he was like using the bike to catch the monkey and eat him.</v>

2233
01:01:56.980 --> 01:01:57.301
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2234
01:01:57.301 --> 01:01:57.511
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2235
01:01:57.511 --> 01:01:57.721
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2236
01:01:57.721 --> 01:01:57.901
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2237
01:01:57.901 --> 01:01:58.081
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

2238
01:01:58.081 --> 01:02:01.650
<v Speaker 4>The monkey fell when the bear ran over the monkey.</v>

2239
01:02:02.190 --> 01:02:03.080
<v Speaker 4>It's not the bay.</v>

2240
01:02:03.081 --> 01:02:03.440
<v Speaker 4>The bears,</v>

2241
01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:04.620
<v Speaker 4>not a strategy guy.</v>

2242
01:02:05.910 --> 01:02:07.800
<v Speaker 4>Thinking five steps ahead.</v>

2243
01:02:07.801 --> 01:02:10.560
<v Speaker 4>I kind of figured out how to fuck this monkey up and make it look like it's his</v>

2244
01:02:10.561 --> 01:02:11.350
<v Speaker 4>fault.</v>

2245
01:02:11.350 --> 01:02:12.330
<v Speaker 4>They just did.</v>

2246
01:02:12.331 --> 01:02:14.760
<v Speaker 4>A documentary is supposed to be good about that.</v>

2247
01:02:14.761 --> 01:02:16.470
<v Speaker 4>A killer whale that ate the trainer.</v>

2248
01:02:16.740 --> 01:02:17.040
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2249
01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:18.120
<v Speaker 4>the about blackfish?</v>

2250
01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:18.930
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2251
01:02:18.930 --> 01:02:19.590
<v Speaker 4>no doubt.</v>

2252
01:02:19.590 --> 01:02:19.891
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2253
01:02:19.891 --> 01:02:20.100
<v Speaker 4>We</v>

2254
01:02:20.100 --> 01:02:23.940
<v Speaker 6>had one of the guys in from marine land that was originally want to till it</v>

2255
01:02:23.941 --> 01:02:24.780
<v Speaker 6>comes trainers.</v>

2256
01:02:24.890 --> 01:02:25.410
<v Speaker 6>Oh really?</v>

2257
01:02:25.410 --> 01:02:25.651
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2258
01:02:25.651 --> 01:02:27.540
<v Speaker 6>We had him in a couple of weeks ago,</v>

2259
01:02:27.541 --> 01:02:28.380
<v Speaker 6>Phil Dimmers,</v>

2260
01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:30.420
<v Speaker 6>and he was fascinating.</v>

2261
01:02:30.660 --> 01:02:31.600
<v Speaker 6>He was telling us like,</v>

2262
01:02:31.710 --> 01:02:33.570
<v Speaker 6>how it's just a goddamn business.</v>

2263
01:02:33.580 --> 01:02:35.000
<v Speaker 6>Like they don't give a fuck about those.</v>

2264
01:02:35.730 --> 01:02:36.570
<v Speaker 6>They treat him like shit.</v>

2265
01:02:36.571 --> 01:02:37.710
<v Speaker 6>Those animals were really smart.</v>

2266
01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:38.191
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>

2267
01:02:38.191 --> 01:02:39.660
<v Speaker 6>This pan is fucking this dude up</v>

2268
01:02:41.180 --> 01:02:41.450
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

2269
01:02:41.450 --> 01:02:43.280
<v Speaker 2>I've never seen a panda that excited about anything.</v>

2270
01:02:43.330 --> 01:02:43.461
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2271
01:02:43.461 --> 01:02:45.400
<v Speaker 2>you would think a panda wouldn't really give a fuck about you.</v>

2272
01:02:45.430 --> 01:02:46.300
<v Speaker 2>Once that jacket,</v>

2273
01:02:46.390 --> 01:02:48.690
<v Speaker 2>he was wearing Jean jacket on genes.</v>

2274
01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:49.713
<v Speaker 2>Genes.</v>

2275
01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:51.680

<v Speaker 2>I hate prison.</v>

2278
01:02:57.010 --> 01:03:00.440
<v Speaker 2>Turns out a panda is a bear at the end of the day,</v>

2279
01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:01.051
<v Speaker 6>he's like,</v>

2280
01:03:01.051 --> 01:03:01.884
<v Speaker 6>I hate prison.</v>

2281
01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:02.460
<v Speaker 6>Come on,</v>

2282
01:03:02.460 --> 01:03:03.271
<v Speaker 6>why you got me in prison?</v>

<v Speaker 6>But I'm.</v>

2285
01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:06.870
<v Speaker 6>Phil was talking to us about marine land,</v>

2286
01:03:06.871 --> 01:03:08.220
<v Speaker 6>about how depressing it has seen those,</v>

2287
01:03:08.310 --> 01:03:12.000
<v Speaker 6>those workers trapped in these fish tanks and they want to have sex with their</v>

2288
01:03:12.001 --> 01:03:17.001
<v Speaker 6>kids because it just confused and they're isolated and it's really,</v>

2289
01:03:17.641 --> 01:03:18.474
<v Speaker 6>really evil.</v>

2290
01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:19.890
<v Speaker 6>If you haven't seen blackfish,</v>

2291
01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:24.360
<v Speaker 6>go see it and if you haven't seen the podcast with Phil was very enlightening</v>

2292
01:03:24.361 --> 01:03:27.480
<v Speaker 6>and eyeopening and if you go to save smooshy.com,</v>

2293
01:03:27.510 --> 01:03:31.470
<v Speaker 6>you can actually aid in his legal defense because he's getting sued by the</v>

2294
01:03:31.471 --> 01:03:35.160
<v Speaker 6>people of marine land who really cancel seaworld Gig.</v>

2295
01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:35.611
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2296
01:03:35.611 --> 01:03:36.960
<v Speaker 6>Martina mcbride is one of them.</v>

2297
01:03:36.961 --> 01:03:37.794
<v Speaker 6>Willie Nelson.</v>

2298
01:03:38.070 --> 01:03:39.250
<v Speaker 6>Joan Jett canceled.</v>

2299
01:03:39.260 --> 01:03:39.370
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2300
01:03:39.370 --> 01:03:40.470
<v Speaker 6>These are just the latest ones.</v>

2301
01:03:40.980 --> 01:03:42.370
<v Speaker 6>Everybody has canceled.</v>

2302
01:03:42.380 --> 01:03:42.610
<v Speaker 6>They.</v>

2303
01:03:42.610 --> 01:03:44.520
<v Speaker 6>They should boycott those things.</v>

2304
01:03:44.521 --> 01:03:45.540
<v Speaker 6>Those things are prisons.</v>

2305
01:03:45.780 --> 01:03:47.130
<v Speaker 6>Those are prisons for aliens.</v>

2306
01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:49.620
<v Speaker 6>The aliens that live under the water and they're smart as shit.</v>

2307
01:03:49.620 --> 01:03:51.920
<v Speaker 6>And if we found them on another planet and we will worship them.</v>

2308
01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:52.280
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

2309
01:03:52.280 --> 01:03:52.860
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

2310
01:03:52.860 --> 01:03:55.830
<v Speaker 6>But because they're in the ocean and because we can catch them with these big</v>

2311
01:03:55.831 --> 01:03:57.390
<v Speaker 6>nets and scooping up with cranes,</v>

2312
01:03:57.660 --> 01:03:58.230
<v Speaker 6>we do it.</v>

2313
01:03:58.230 --> 01:03:59.100
<v Speaker 6>We're assholes.</v>

2314
01:03:59.220 --> 01:04:00.300
<v Speaker 6>People who run seaworld,</v>

2315
01:04:00.330 --> 01:04:02.130
<v Speaker 6>you are fucking assholes.</v>

2316
01:04:02.340 --> 01:04:05.400
<v Speaker 6>No one knows those dolphins and whales more than you guys do.</v>

2317
01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:06.420
<v Speaker 6>And you know what you're doing.</v>

2318
01:04:06.421 --> 01:04:07.380
<v Speaker 6>So fuck you.</v>

2319
01:04:07.381 --> 01:04:08.550
<v Speaker 6>I've never gone to sea world.</v>

2320
01:04:08.551 --> 01:04:10.860
<v Speaker 6>I never will go to see what I've always thought.</v>

2321
01:04:10.870 --> 01:04:13.890
<v Speaker 6>Cal was fucked up and talking to this guy just.</v>

2322
01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:17.190
<v Speaker 6>He just cemented that thought in my mind.</v>

2323
01:04:17.490 --> 01:04:17.940
<v Speaker 6>It's just,</v>

2324
01:04:17.940 --> 01:04:19.680
<v Speaker 6>it's not because they grab them as kids.</v>

2325
01:04:19.681 --> 01:04:20.200
<v Speaker 6>I mean the part,</v>

2326
01:04:20.200 --> 01:04:20.461
<v Speaker 6>the part.</v>

2327
01:04:20.461 --> 01:04:21.930
<v Speaker 6>I only saw two minutes of the documentary,</v>

2328
01:04:21.931 --> 01:04:25.080
<v Speaker 6>but they grabbed the kids out of the water and the rest of the whales wait</v>

2329
01:04:25.081 --> 01:04:27.810
<v Speaker 6>around because they don't want to leave because they realize one of them has</v>

2330
01:04:27.811 --> 01:04:29.200
<v Speaker 6>been trapped and it's so fucked,</v>

2331
01:04:29.201 --> 01:04:29.580
<v Speaker 6>dude.</v>

2332
01:04:29.580 --> 01:04:30.151
<v Speaker 6>They're smart,</v>

2333
01:04:30.151 --> 01:04:30.600
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

2334
01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:30.771
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>

2335
01:04:30.771 --> 01:04:31.604
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

2336
01:04:31.770 --> 01:04:32.700
<v Speaker 6>we can't do that.</v>

2337
01:04:32.790 --> 01:04:33.750
<v Speaker 6>That's not cool.</v>

2338
01:04:33.900 --> 01:04:36.090
<v Speaker 6>You can't do that just because you can't understand what they're saying when</v>

2339
01:04:36.091 --> 01:04:36.924
<v Speaker 6>they complain.</v>

2340
01:04:37.380 --> 01:04:38.370
<v Speaker 6>We know they're smart.</v>

2341
01:04:38.460 --> 01:04:39.140
<v Speaker 6>You know?</v>

2342
01:04:39.140 --> 01:04:40.950
<v Speaker 6>It's one of the most evil things.</v>

2343
01:04:40.951 --> 01:04:41.191
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

2344
01:04:41.191 --> 01:04:42.540
<v Speaker 6>it's essentially slavery.</v>

2345
01:04:42.750 --> 01:04:46.350
<v Speaker 6>It's no different than slavery and the idea that it is like this is not a</v>

2346
01:04:46.351 --> 01:04:47.160
<v Speaker 6>goldfish.</v>

2347
01:04:47.160 --> 01:04:47.551
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

2348
01:04:47.551 --> 01:04:49.380
<v Speaker 6>You can take a gold fish and do whatever you want to it.</v>

2349
01:04:49.381 --> 01:04:50.190
<v Speaker 6>I don't give a shit.</v>

2350
01:04:50.190 --> 01:04:51.540
<v Speaker 6>You could eat a goldfish for a prank.</v>

2351
01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:52.740
<v Speaker 6>You will never hear me complain.</v>

2352
01:04:53.010 --> 01:04:53.820
<v Speaker 6>You know why?</v>

2353
01:04:53.820 --> 01:04:55.110
<v Speaker 6>Because goldfish aren't smart.</v>

2354
01:04:55.530 --> 01:04:59.010
<v Speaker 6>I like smart things and things that are really smart.</v>

2355
01:04:59.140 --> 01:05:00.230
<v Speaker 6>Know not like dogs,</v>

2356
01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:00.890
<v Speaker 6>pigs,</v>

01:05:01.201 --> 01:05:04.050
<v Speaker 6>Like dolphins are really fucking smart.</v>

2359
01:05:04.051 --> 01:05:06.990
<v Speaker 6>Like kind of people smart in some weird way.</v>

2360
01:05:07.350 --> 01:05:07.941
<v Speaker 6>And you,</v>

2361
01:05:07.941 --> 01:05:10.080
<v Speaker 6>you're an asshole if you put that in the fucking swimming pool.</v>

2362
01:05:10.110 --> 01:05:11.190
<v Speaker 6>They like use tools.</v>

2363
01:05:11.290 --> 01:05:12.123
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2364
01:05:12.210 --> 01:05:12.820
<v Speaker 6>Well they're.</v>

2365
01:05:12.820 --> 01:05:16.560
<v Speaker 6>They're maniacs and they do a lot of bad things and there's a video of a master</v>

2366
01:05:16.561 --> 01:05:17.351
<v Speaker 6>of masturbating.</v>

2367
01:05:17.351 --> 01:05:19.000
<v Speaker 6>Dolphin was fucking a headless fish.</v>

2368
01:05:20.360 --> 01:05:20.990
<v Speaker 5>They're crazy.</v>

2369
01:05:20.990 --> 01:05:23.940
<v Speaker 5>They're hypersexual is side.</v>

2370
01:05:23.960 --> 01:05:25.150
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of humans.</v>

2371

<v Speaker 5>You got your genius is and then you've got the ones that are seeing how big the</v>

<v Speaker 5>asshole.</v>

2373
01:05:28.470 --> 01:05:31.140
<v Speaker 6>No doubt and much like humans,</v>

2374
01:05:31.141 --> 01:05:32.790
<v Speaker 6>the vast majority of them are good.</v>

2375
01:05:33.150 --> 01:05:33.630
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2376
01:05:33.630 --> 01:05:37.320
<v Speaker 6>if you're walking around on the street in any normal city,</v>

2377
01:05:37.321 --> 01:05:40.290
<v Speaker 6>the vast majority of the people that you run into are good people and not trying</v>

2378
01:05:40.291 --> 01:05:41.080
<v Speaker 6>to be criminals.</v>

2379
01:05:41.080 --> 01:05:43.920
<v Speaker 6>They're not trying to hurt others or just most people are good people.</v>

2380
01:05:44.100 --> 01:05:47.340
<v Speaker 6>It's just the ones that are not good stand out to me.</v>

2381
01:05:47.410 --> 01:05:49.690
<v Speaker 6>Focus on them and it becomes something that people want to pay attention.</v>

2382
01:05:50.060 --> 01:05:50.800
<v Speaker 5>I have a,</v>

2383
01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:54.730
<v Speaker 5>I have a thing I do in my act about how these top billionaires like the Koch</v>

2384
01:05:54.731 --> 01:05:56.320
<v Speaker 5>brothers and shit like we,</v>

2385
01:05:56.350 --> 01:05:59.620
<v Speaker 5>I hate when people go to them for advice on like how to run the society.</v>

2386
01:05:59.621 --> 01:06:00.090
<v Speaker 5>Like they're,</v>

2387
01:06:00.090 --> 01:06:01.260
<v Speaker 5>they're psychopaths.</v>

2388
01:06:01.270 --> 01:06:05.170
<v Speaker 5>I mean there you wouldn't respect anyone else who collects a billion of</v>

2389
01:06:05.171 --> 01:06:06.400
<v Speaker 5>something or like,</v>

2390
01:06:06.600 --> 01:06:06.800
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2391
01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:08.770
<v Speaker 5>if you find that someone's got a million shoes,</v>

2392
01:06:08.771 --> 01:06:09.101
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2393
01:06:09.101 --> 01:06:10.210
<v Speaker 5>they have a fucking problem.</v>

2394
01:06:10.570 --> 01:06:12.370
<v Speaker 5>What about if a guy like Bill Gates,</v>

2395
01:06:13.300 --> 01:06:14.680
<v Speaker 5>I think I've read everything I've heard.</v>

2396
01:06:14.681 --> 01:06:18.280
<v Speaker 5>He's kind of a psychopath to not the not the initial inventing stuff.</v>

2397
01:06:18.281 --> 01:06:18.910
<v Speaker 5>It's the,</v>

2398
01:06:18.910 --> 01:06:20.060
<v Speaker 5>it's what you do after that.</v>

2399
01:06:20.490 --> 01:06:21.323
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

2400
01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:21.541
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

2401
01:06:21.541 --> 01:06:22.021
<v Speaker 6>what is it?</v>

2402
01:06:22.021 --> 01:06:24.660
<v Speaker 6>Is it just that he kept going and kept making more and more and more to the</v>

2403
01:06:24.661 --> 01:06:25.494
<v Speaker 6>point where he just,</v>

2404
01:06:25.530 --> 01:06:26.880
<v Speaker 6>who needs $90,000,000,</v>

2405
01:06:26.881 --> 01:06:27.210
<v Speaker 6>dude?</v>

2406
01:06:27.210 --> 01:06:27.361
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2407
01:06:27.361 --> 01:06:28.220
<v Speaker 5>it's not just make it,</v>

2408
01:06:28.230 --> 01:06:28.650
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

2409
01:06:28.650 --> 01:06:29.850
<v Speaker 5>I mean the way they make more.</v>

2410
01:06:29.851 --> 01:06:32.010
<v Speaker 5>I don't know specifically about what Microsoft does,</v>

2411
01:06:32.011 --> 01:06:33.570
<v Speaker 5>but it's a lot of like,</v>

2412
01:06:33.600 --> 01:06:34.090
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2413
01:06:34.090 --> 01:06:37.690
<v Speaker 6>tearing apart anybody else that could threaten them and does apple,</v>

2414
01:06:38.590 --> 01:06:39.370
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2415
01:06:39.370 --> 01:06:40.360
<v Speaker 6>apple is pretty ruthless.</v>

2416
01:06:40.361 --> 01:06:41.170
<v Speaker 6>I'm not defending any.</v>

2417
01:06:41.170 --> 01:06:42.070
<v Speaker 6>It comes to competition.</v>

2418
01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.400
<v Speaker 6>All these businesses where they're making tons of money,</v>

2419
01:06:45.660 --> 01:06:46.180
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2420
01:06:46.180 --> 01:06:47.050
<v Speaker 6>they protect that shit.</v>

2421
01:06:47.140 --> 01:06:48.070
<v Speaker 6>It's a game.</v>

2422
01:06:48.130 --> 01:06:49.780
<v Speaker 6>It's just like protecting your pieces.</v>

2423
01:06:49.781 --> 01:06:50.614
<v Speaker 6>If you're playing chess,</v>

2424
01:06:50.890 --> 01:06:52.240
<v Speaker 6>if you're in the business to make money,</v>

2425
01:06:52.300 --> 01:06:52.620
<v Speaker 6>that's,</v>

2426
01:06:52.620 --> 01:06:52.820
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2427
01:06:52.820 --> 01:06:53.790
<v Speaker 6>you offer good products.</v>

2428
01:06:53.791 --> 01:06:55.060
<v Speaker 6>So your conscience is clear.</v>

2429
01:06:55.240 --> 01:06:56.680
<v Speaker 6>I mean apple makes a hell of a laptop,</v>

2430
01:06:56.880 --> 01:06:57.790
<v Speaker 6>they make great stuff,</v>

2431
01:06:57.791 --> 01:06:58.624
<v Speaker 6>but</v>

2432
01:06:58.630 --> 01:06:59.710
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if they're conscious,</v>

2433
01:07:00.530 --> 01:07:03.760
<v Speaker 5>if they're kind of looking at the netting around the Foxconn factory in us.</v>

2434
01:07:04.510 --> 01:07:05.420
<v Speaker 5>Essentially no one</v>

2435
01:07:05.500 --> 01:07:06.310
<v Speaker 6>can be.</v>

2436
01:07:06.310 --> 01:07:10.540
<v Speaker 6>No one can be conscience clear because we all get these conflict minerals that</v>

2437
01:07:10.710 --> 01:07:14.680
<v Speaker 6>power electronics and they almost all come from impoverished areas with a lot</v>

2438
01:07:14.681 --> 01:07:15.220
<v Speaker 6>of,</v>

2439
01:07:15.220 --> 01:07:17.760
<v Speaker 6>for the longest time that Congo is of slaves that were doing it.</v>

2440
01:07:18.650 --> 01:07:21.190
<v Speaker 6>Still still is in a lot of places.</v>

2441
01:07:21.191 --> 01:07:22.024
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

2442
01:07:22.030 --> 01:07:24.340
<v Speaker 6>vice did some powerful work on that.</v>

2443
01:07:24.600 --> 01:07:24.970
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

2444
01:07:24.970 --> 01:07:25.620
<v Speaker 6>Shane Smith,</v>

2445
01:07:25.620 --> 01:07:26.650
<v Speaker 6>it will be here on Wednesday.</v>

2446
01:07:26.950 --> 01:07:27.281
<v Speaker 6>They,</v>

2447
01:07:27.281 --> 01:07:28.030
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

2448
01:07:28.030 --> 01:07:30.760
<v Speaker 6>they went there and they investigated the whole what's,</v>

2449
01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:31.571
<v Speaker 6>what's going on,</v>

2450
01:07:31.571 --> 01:07:32.980
<v Speaker 6>like why do we need to be here?</v>

2451
01:07:32.981 --> 01:07:33.311
<v Speaker 6>Like what,</v>

2452
01:07:33.311 --> 01:07:33.720
<v Speaker 6>what is,</v>

2453
01:07:33.720 --> 01:07:34.260
<v Speaker 6>what is,</v>

2454
01:07:34.260 --> 01:07:36.160
<v Speaker 6>what's the main appeal?</v>

2455
01:07:36.161 --> 01:07:37.690
<v Speaker 6>And it's cold hands cold Tanja.</v>

2456
01:07:37.750 --> 01:07:39.370
<v Speaker 6>It's stuff that they used to make cell phones.</v>

2457
01:07:39.371 --> 01:07:40.810
<v Speaker 6>We need it all cell phones.</v>

2458
01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:46.040
<v Speaker 6>So it's almost impossible to like have a conflict free like electric car.</v>

2459
01:07:47.900 --> 01:07:48.471
<v Speaker 5>But here's the thing,</v>

2460
01:07:48.471 --> 01:07:49.251
<v Speaker 5>you could pay,</v>

2461
01:07:49.251 --> 01:07:50.090
<v Speaker 5>I mean a different.</v>

2462
01:07:50.091 --> 01:07:51.440
<v Speaker 5>If our system was set up differently,</v>

2463
01:07:51.441 --> 01:07:55.100
<v Speaker 5>you could pay those workers mining that Colton a nice wage,</v>

2464
01:07:55.340 --> 01:07:56.420
<v Speaker 5>a livable wage.</v>

2465
01:07:56.690 --> 01:07:57.523
<v Speaker 5>No Shit.</v>

2466
01:07:57.700 --> 01:07:58.650
<v Speaker 6>There was a um,</v>

2467
01:07:58.890 --> 01:07:59.240
<v Speaker 6>there's,</v>

2468
01:07:59.240 --> 01:08:00.073
<v Speaker 6>there's some,</v>

2469
01:08:00.320 --> 01:08:02.320
<v Speaker 6>I don't know if they ever got done,</v>

2470
01:08:02.321 --> 01:08:02.750
<v Speaker 6>but I know it was,</v>

2471
01:08:02.750 --> 01:08:06.250
<v Speaker 6>it was a proposition to make cell phones that were,</v>

2472
01:08:06.280 --> 01:08:08.320
<v Speaker 6>there's a thing called free phone and everything,</v>

2473
01:08:09.160 --> 01:08:14.020
<v Speaker 6>but I think they only went when they only had like three g they didn't have like</v>

2474
01:08:14.021 --> 01:08:16.490
<v Speaker 6>for lte that we're like a step behind</v>

2475
01:08:16.630 --> 01:08:17.570
<v Speaker 4>where people are like,</v>

2476
01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:18.433
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2477
01:08:18.500 --> 01:08:19.460
<v Speaker 4>I need the latest shit.</v>

2478
01:08:20.190 --> 01:08:21.020
<v Speaker 4>I want to,</v>

2479
01:08:21.020 --> 01:08:21.831
<v Speaker 4>I want to save the world.</v>

2480
01:08:21.831 --> 01:08:23.150
<v Speaker 4>But the cell phone that I had last year,</v>

2481
01:08:24.090 --> 01:08:25.280
<v Speaker 4>it's not good enough.</v>

2482
01:08:25.310 --> 01:08:25.791
<v Speaker 4>Listen,</v>

2483
01:08:25.791 --> 01:08:26.571
<v Speaker 4>I need some new shoes.</v>

2484
01:08:26.571 --> 01:08:27.560
<v Speaker 4>I need to save the world.</v>

2485
01:08:27.561 --> 01:08:28.970
<v Speaker 4>But this cell phones a month old.</v>

2486
01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:30.520
<v Speaker 4>So at htc one,</v>

2487
01:08:30.530 --> 01:08:31.363
<v Speaker 4>can you do that?</v>

2488
01:08:31.730 --> 01:08:35.230
<v Speaker 4>Can you make me one of those people don't want the older shit.</v>

2489
01:08:35.830 --> 01:08:36.350
<v Speaker 4>We've,</v>

2490
01:08:36.350 --> 01:08:38.990
<v Speaker 4>we've been carefully trained to not want the eldership.</v>

2491
01:08:39.380 --> 01:08:40.213
<v Speaker 4>Is that what it is?</v>

2492
01:08:40.770 --> 01:08:41.603
<v Speaker 4>We've been trained,</v>

2493
01:08:41.900 --> 01:08:42.620
<v Speaker 4>isn't it though?</v>

2494
01:08:42.620 --> 01:08:45.470
<v Speaker 4>Isn't it just a natural human inclination to always want the best?</v>

2495
01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:46.210
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2496
01:08:46.210 --> 01:08:47.930
<v Speaker 4>So I think it's a natural human inclination.</v>

2497
01:08:47.931 --> 01:08:48.764
<v Speaker 4>Like I,</v>

2498
01:08:48.800 --> 01:08:50.210
<v Speaker 4>I feel that materialism.</v>

2499
01:08:50.480 --> 01:08:52.700
<v Speaker 4>I think materialism is obviously an empty pursuit.</v>

2500
01:08:52.701 --> 01:08:52.850
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2501
01:08:52.850 --> 01:08:56.090
<v Speaker 4>I don't think anybody can argue that the pursuit of objects ultimately over</v>

2502
01:08:56.091 --> 01:08:59.900
<v Speaker 4>everything over emotions and friendships and love affairs does stupid,</v>

2503
01:09:00.050 --> 01:09:01.990
<v Speaker 4>stupid objects are not going to make you happy.</v>

2504
01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:02.900
<v Speaker 4>You need all those other things,</v>

2505
01:09:03.380 --> 01:09:05.780
<v Speaker 4>but if you have all those other things,</v>

2506
01:09:05.870 --> 01:09:07.070
<v Speaker 4>then objects are pretty cool.</v>

2507
01:09:07.830 --> 01:09:08.663
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

2508
01:09:08.750 --> 01:09:09.530
<v Speaker 4>I mean if,</v>

2509
01:09:09.530 --> 01:09:13.140
<v Speaker 4>if somebody gives you like a really dope lamp and you put it in your office,</v>

2510
01:09:13.141 --> 01:09:13.371
<v Speaker 4>you're like,</v>

2511
01:09:13.371 --> 01:09:15.890
<v Speaker 4>this thing is fucking bad ass and you look at it,</v>

2512
01:09:15.891 --> 01:09:16.970
<v Speaker 4>it gives you like a good feeling.</v>

2513
01:09:17.120 --> 01:09:19.220
<v Speaker 4>That's a bacterial thing that you own.</v>

2514
01:09:19.221 --> 01:09:22.790
<v Speaker 4>That's actually pretty nice and artworks falls into that as well.</v>

2515
01:09:22.950 --> 01:09:23.181
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2516
01:09:23.181 --> 01:09:24.770
<v Speaker 4>our work essentially is materialism.</v>

2517
01:09:24.771 --> 01:09:25.970
<v Speaker 4>If you're collecting paintings,</v>

2518
01:09:26.270 --> 01:09:26.931
<v Speaker 4>I mean you're,</v>

2519
01:09:26.931 --> 01:09:30.260
<v Speaker 4>you're collecting someone's expression and someone's work,</v>

2520
01:09:30.261 --> 01:09:32.270
<v Speaker 4>but you're also collecting a material thing,</v>

2521
01:09:32.540 --> 01:09:32.930
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2522
01:09:32.930 --> 01:09:34.090
<v Speaker 4>You're collecting an object,</v>

2523
01:09:34.490 --> 01:09:35.001
<v Speaker 4>but I think.</v>

2524
01:09:35.001 --> 01:09:37.490
<v Speaker 4>I think it's a vicious cycle in which we're,</v>

2525
01:09:37.580 --> 01:09:40.580
<v Speaker 4>we're told to always want the newest one and they are.</v>

2526
01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:44.600
<v Speaker 4>The companies were rewarded for designing something that changes every month.</v>

2527
01:09:44.770 --> 01:09:45.040
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2528
01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:45.680
<v Speaker 4>I boot it up.</v>

2529
01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:49.820
<v Speaker 4>I hadn't used my ipad and I just didn't have any use for it for like two years</v>

2530
01:09:49.821 --> 01:09:50.870
<v Speaker 4>and I rebooted it up.</v>

2531
01:09:51.050 --> 01:09:52.400
<v Speaker 4>Nothing works with it anymore.</v>

2532
01:09:52.580 --> 01:09:56.870
<v Speaker 4>You can't know apps work nothing because it's designed to kick you off and say,</v>

2533
01:09:56.871 --> 01:09:57.021
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2534
01:09:57.021 --> 01:09:57.920
<v Speaker 4>you gotta get a new one,</v>

2535
01:09:57.921 --> 01:09:58.490
<v Speaker 4>or what are you going to,</v>

2536
01:09:58.490 --> 01:09:58.761
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2537
01:09:58.761 --> 01:10:00.440
<v Speaker 4>everything stops working well.</v>

2538
01:10:00.500 --> 01:10:02.120
<v Speaker 4>There's a reason for that though.</v>

2539
01:10:02.150 --> 01:10:06.560
<v Speaker 4>The reason for that engineering wise is that they want to be able to control</v>

2540
01:10:06.561 --> 01:10:09.920
<v Speaker 4>their product ultimately and they want to make it the best experience possible.</v>

2541
01:10:10.220 --> 01:10:11.053
<v Speaker 4>Like there's A.</v>

2542
01:10:11.060 --> 01:10:13.130
<v Speaker 4>There's not a logical,</v>

2543
01:10:13.131 --> 01:10:16.550
<v Speaker 4>but there's a technological reason for some of the only updating the operating</v>

2544
01:10:16.551 --> 01:10:16.941
<v Speaker 4>system.</v>

2545
01:10:16.941 --> 01:10:19.190
<v Speaker 4>Constantly updating the applications constantly.</v>

2546
01:10:19.310 --> 01:10:20.143
<v Speaker 4>They improve them,</v>

2547
01:10:20.270 --> 01:10:21.170
<v Speaker 4>they get them out of time,</v>

2548
01:10:21.171 --> 01:10:23.900
<v Speaker 4>but changing the shape of the changing the shape of the plug.</v>

2549
01:10:24.350 --> 01:10:26.330
<v Speaker 4>Oh well you can't have the old plug,</v>

2550
01:10:26.360 --> 01:10:31.360
<v Speaker 4>but it transfers data quicker and it was that they had the old books in the new</v>

2551
01:10:31.491 --> 01:10:33.140
<v Speaker 4>plugs a million times if you will.</v>

2552
01:10:33.140 --> 01:10:33.501
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>

2553
01:10:33.501 --> 01:10:34.610
<v Speaker 4>and you're wrong at the same time.</v>

2554
01:10:34.611 --> 01:10:35.151
<v Speaker 4>You're right.</v>

2555
01:10:35.151 --> 01:10:37.220
<v Speaker 4>If you want to think as far as economics and like,</v>

2556
01:10:37.221 --> 01:10:37.341
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2557
01:10:37.341 --> 01:10:38.360
<v Speaker 4>you should be able to save people money,</v>

2558
01:10:38.361 --> 01:10:39.590
<v Speaker 4>let him use a USB plug.</v>

2559
01:10:39.800 --> 01:10:42.170
<v Speaker 4>Why do you have to have this thing that nobody else has?</v>

2560
01:10:42.470 --> 01:10:45.080
<v Speaker 4>But the thing that nobody else has works better,</v>

2561
01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:46.430
<v Speaker 4>which is it's a better.</v>

2562
01:10:46.790 --> 01:10:47.990
<v Speaker 4>It transfers data quicker.</v>

2563
01:10:47.991 --> 01:10:49.040
<v Speaker 4>It's a better connection.</v>

2564
01:10:49.190 --> 01:10:49.670
<v Speaker 4>Allegedly.</v>

2565
01:10:49.670 --> 01:10:50.503
<v Speaker 4>What do I know?</v>

2566
01:10:50.890 --> 01:10:51.723
<v Speaker 4>If you have,</v>

2567
01:10:52.500 --> 01:10:54.100
<v Speaker 4>if you have like a playstation one goal,</v>

2568
01:10:54.120 --> 01:10:58.310
<v Speaker 4>you're not going to play it like a playstation four shit called five.</v>

2569
01:10:58.340 --> 01:10:59.390
<v Speaker 4>What is the new thing?</v>

2570
01:10:59.391 --> 01:11:00.680
<v Speaker 4>Lightening Bolt connection.</v>

2571
01:11:01.190 --> 01:11:01.940
<v Speaker 4>Is that what it is?</v>

2572
01:11:01.940 --> 01:11:02.420
<v Speaker 4>Is that.</v>

2573
01:11:02.420 --> 01:11:03.980
<v Speaker 4>And is that what connects your,</v>

2574
01:11:03.981 --> 01:11:04.460
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2575
01:11:04.460 --> 01:11:05.660
<v Speaker 4>like a iphone five?</v>

2576
01:11:05.730 --> 01:11:06.110
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2577
01:11:06.110 --> 01:11:07.460
<v Speaker 4>lightening bolt connector better.</v>

2578
01:11:07.520 --> 01:11:07.851
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2579
01:11:07.851 --> 01:11:08.630
<v Speaker 4>Here's the question.</v>

2580
01:11:08.630 --> 01:11:08.871
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>

2581
01:11:08.871 --> 01:11:09.531
<v Speaker 4>it's a lot better.</v>

2582
01:11:09.531 --> 01:11:12.440
<v Speaker 4>It's a lot faster and it's a different USB.</v>

2583
01:11:12.510 --> 01:11:13.020
<v Speaker 4>Also.</v>

2584
01:11:13.020 --> 01:11:13.860
<v Speaker 4>The old one is</v>

2585
01:11:14.190 --> 01:11:15.150
<v Speaker 7>a lot slower.</v>

2586
01:11:15.870 --> 01:11:16.591
<v Speaker 7>The connections.</v>

2587
01:11:16.591 --> 01:11:17.241
<v Speaker 7>Remember like,</v>

2588
01:11:17.241 --> 01:11:17.810
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

2589
01:11:17.810 --> 01:11:18.660
<v Speaker 7>where uh,</v>

2590
01:11:18.820 --> 01:11:20.490
<v Speaker 7>you would always have problems with like plugs,</v>

2591
01:11:20.520 --> 01:11:20.701
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>

2592
01:11:20.701 --> 01:11:24.540
<v Speaker 7>or if he had like a alarm clock that had a doc system in it always had that</v>

2593
01:11:24.541 --> 01:11:27.420
<v Speaker 7>wiggle thing where you had to put something behind it just to get it connected.</v>

2594
01:11:27.660 --> 01:11:31.890
<v Speaker 7>That's because it was just not a well designed plug for multiple years.</v>

2595
01:11:32.620 --> 01:11:33.453
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2596
01:11:34.370 --> 01:11:35.570
<v Speaker 6>apparently it does.</v>

2597
01:11:35.840 --> 01:11:36.231
<v Speaker 6>It does.</v>

2598
01:11:36.231 --> 01:11:37.280
<v Speaker 6>It transfers data,</v>

2599
01:11:37.290 --> 01:11:39.020
<v Speaker 6>quicker transfers.</v>

2600
01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:39.920
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>

2601
01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:42.230
<v Speaker 6>Data up to 10 gigabytes per second.</v>

2602
01:11:42.290 --> 01:11:45.500
<v Speaker 6>Double the speed of current USB three point zero.</v>

2603
01:11:45.620 --> 01:11:46.660
<v Speaker 6>So that just answered it.</v>

2604
01:11:46.670 --> 01:11:48.050
<v Speaker 6>We're only talking about tech.</v>

2605
01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:48.830
<v Speaker 6>I mean there's,</v>

2606
01:11:48.830 --> 01:11:49.663
<v Speaker 6>there's other things.</v>

2607
01:11:50.090 --> 01:11:54.800
<v Speaker 6>Shelves shelves collapsed and a month now I get like Ikea Shit.</v>

2608
01:11:54.830 --> 01:11:55.071
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2609
01:11:55.071 --> 01:11:58.550
<v Speaker 6>But we're talking about updating applications and how your ipad wouldn't work</v>

2610
01:11:58.551 --> 01:12:01.520
<v Speaker 6>and I really think that that's because they're just constantly upgrading shit</v>

2611
01:12:01.521 --> 01:12:03.890
<v Speaker 6>and then making it better and faster and I agree.</v>

2612
01:12:03.891 --> 01:12:05.840
<v Speaker 6>It's frustrating if you're trying to save money,</v>

2613
01:12:06.140 --> 01:12:07.940
<v Speaker 6>but if you're not trying to save money,</v>

2614
01:12:07.941 --> 01:12:09.020
<v Speaker 6>that's what you want them to do.</v>

2615
01:12:09.330 --> 01:12:09.531
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2616
01:12:09.531 --> 01:12:11.300
<v Speaker 6>you want everybody to push the latest shit,</v>

2617
01:12:11.350 --> 01:12:11.560
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2618
01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:11.871
<v Speaker 6>like Oh,</v>

2619
01:12:11.871 --> 01:12:12.231
<v Speaker 6>so what?</v>

2620
01:12:12.231 --> 01:12:13.070
<v Speaker 6>I have to get a new plug,</v>

2621
01:12:13.280 --> 01:12:17.300
<v Speaker 6>but now my business can transfer its data in 20 minutes as opposed to 40 minutes</v>

2622
01:12:17.301 --> 01:12:18.050
<v Speaker 6>or so.</v>

2623
01:12:18.050 --> 01:12:19.190
<v Speaker 6>I've got the older phone,</v>

2624
01:12:19.191 --> 01:12:22.070
<v Speaker 6>whatever this says the android and I've had it for like two years and I still</v>

2625
01:12:22.071 --> 01:12:22.904
<v Speaker 6>works fine.</v>

2626
01:12:22.910 --> 01:12:24.320
<v Speaker 6>I just don't have the fastest phone.</v>

2627
01:12:24.321 --> 01:12:25.100
<v Speaker 6>He's telling my dad,</v>

2628
01:12:25.100 --> 01:12:25.933
<v Speaker 6>what's going on with you?</v>

2629
01:12:26.060 --> 01:12:26.893
<v Speaker 6>You're a young man.</v>

2630
01:12:27.050 --> 01:12:27.620
<v Speaker 6>You're young,</v>

2631
01:12:27.620 --> 01:12:28.453
<v Speaker 6>you're healthy.</v>

2632
01:12:28.460 --> 01:12:29.660
<v Speaker 6>I don't need the fastest phone</v>

2633
01:12:31.550 --> 01:12:32.161
<v Speaker 6>works fine.</v>

2634
01:12:32.161 --> 01:12:32.421
<v Speaker 6>It works,</v>

2635
01:12:32.421 --> 01:12:34.040
<v Speaker 6>but I used to joke about that.</v>

2636
01:12:34.041 --> 01:12:35.150
<v Speaker 6>I use a carrier pigeon.</v>

2637
01:12:35.340 --> 01:12:38.180
<v Speaker 6>I you do a joke about 12 years.</v>

2638
01:12:38.210 --> 01:12:39.650
<v Speaker 6>No one ever looks at cell phones.</v>

2639
01:12:39.651 --> 01:12:39.861
<v Speaker 6>It goes,</v>

2640
01:12:39.861 --> 01:12:40.071
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>

2641
01:12:40.071 --> 01:12:40.460
<v Speaker 6>that's it.</v>

2642
01:12:40.460 --> 01:12:41.293
<v Speaker 6>We're done.</v>

2643
01:12:41.310 --> 01:12:42.143
<v Speaker 6>We're done.</v>

2644
01:12:42.450 --> 01:12:43.283
<v Speaker 6>Screen's big enough.</v>

2645
01:12:43.370 --> 01:12:44.203
<v Speaker 6>Fast enough.</v>

2646
01:12:44.540 --> 01:12:46.100
<v Speaker 6>It's not gonna happen like we,</v>

2647
01:12:46.280 --> 01:12:47.240
<v Speaker 6>for whatever reason,</v>

2648
01:12:47.241 --> 01:12:48.320
<v Speaker 6>we need the latest,</v>

2649
01:12:48.321 --> 01:12:49.154
<v Speaker 6>greatest shit.</v>

2650
01:12:49.730 --> 01:12:50.530
<v Speaker 6>We all do.</v>

2651
01:12:50.530 --> 01:12:53.260
<v Speaker 6>And you might not because you're a fucking loser.</v>

2652
01:12:53.330 --> 01:12:54.081
<v Speaker 6>Bohemian.</v>

2653
01:12:54.081 --> 01:12:55.970
<v Speaker 6>Which a two year old ipad.</v>

2654
01:12:57.130 --> 01:12:58.790
<v Speaker 6>I'll pull out my etch a sketch.</v>

2655
01:13:00.090 --> 01:13:00.440
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>

2656
01:13:00.440 --> 01:13:01.340
<v Speaker 6>it was good for a laugh</v>

2657
01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:03.833
<v Speaker 6>glances.</v>

2658
01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:04.281
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2659
01:13:04.281 --> 01:13:04.980
<v Speaker 6>I think.</v>

2660
01:13:04.980 --> 01:13:06.830
<v Speaker 6>I honestly think that what we're talking about,</v>

2661
01:13:06.890 --> 01:13:07.491
<v Speaker 6>materialism,</v>

2662
01:13:07.491 --> 01:13:08.720
<v Speaker 6>although it's kind of an empty pursuit,</v>

2663
01:13:08.740 --> 01:13:11.270
<v Speaker 6>I really think that it's one of the things that's pushing,</v>

2664
01:13:11.560 --> 01:13:12.350
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

2665
01:13:12.350 --> 01:13:14.690
<v Speaker 6>what human beings are doing on this planet overall,</v>

2666
01:13:14.691 --> 01:13:16.490
<v Speaker 6>which is advancing technology.</v>

2667
01:13:16.690 --> 01:13:18.110
<v Speaker 6>I think one of the things that we do,</v>

2668
01:13:18.530 --> 01:13:21.170
<v Speaker 6>if you looked at us just completely outside of our culture,</v>

2669
01:13:21.171 --> 01:13:22.070
<v Speaker 6>outside of your life,</v>

2670
01:13:22.340 --> 01:13:22.990
<v Speaker 6>outside of your,</v>

2671
01:13:22.990 --> 01:13:23.640
<v Speaker 6>your you know,</v>

2672
01:13:23.640 --> 01:13:28.310
<v Speaker 6>your reality and looked at this swarm of beings and what's at the forefront of</v>

2673
01:13:28.311 --> 01:13:29.081
<v Speaker 6>swarm of beings.</v>

2674
01:13:29.081 --> 01:13:29.914
<v Speaker 6>It's objects.</v>

2675
01:13:30.140 --> 01:13:31.570
<v Speaker 6>They're constantly creating newer cars,</v>

2676
01:13:31.580 --> 01:13:32.361
<v Speaker 6>bigger tvs,</v>

2677
01:13:32.361 --> 01:13:33.171
<v Speaker 6>better computers,</v>

2678
01:13:33.171 --> 01:13:33.950
<v Speaker 6>better phones,</v>

2679
01:13:33.950 --> 01:13:35.840
<v Speaker 6>constantly obsessing objects,</v>

2680
01:13:35.841 --> 01:13:39.140
<v Speaker 6>and they're working jobs they don't even enjoy just to feed the machine that</v>

2681
01:13:39.141 --> 01:13:40.070
<v Speaker 6>creates these objects,</v>

2682
01:13:40.760 --> 01:13:41.870
<v Speaker 6>which is a really sad.</v>

2683
01:13:41.871 --> 01:13:44.780
<v Speaker 6>When you get a job they don't enjoy.</v>

2684
01:13:44.840 --> 01:13:45.673
<v Speaker 6>I don't know if it's.</v>

2685
01:13:46.110 --> 01:13:47.060
<v Speaker 6>There's a lot of people though.</v>

2686
01:13:47.680 --> 01:13:48.513
<v Speaker 6>That's my point.</v>

2687
01:13:48.860 --> 01:13:51.440
<v Speaker 6>A good percentage of people made a mistake somewhere and did something that they</v>

2688
01:13:51.441 --> 01:13:52.274
<v Speaker 6>don't want to do.</v>

2689
01:13:52.700 --> 01:13:55.670
<v Speaker 6>Good percentage that did it for just a living and there's no passion to their</v>

2690
01:13:55.671 --> 01:13:56.240
<v Speaker 6>life.</v>

2691
01:13:56.240 --> 01:13:57.110
<v Speaker 6>It's a good percentage.</v>

2692
01:13:57.500 --> 01:14:00.710
<v Speaker 6>I wonder though if when you see all this symbiotic connection that we have,</v>

2693
01:14:00.711 --> 01:14:01.610
<v Speaker 6>like with cell phones,</v>

2694
01:14:01.611 --> 01:14:03.740
<v Speaker 6>like you can't leave your house about yourself when you feel weird.</v>

2695
01:14:04.130 --> 01:14:04.870
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2696
01:14:04.870 --> 01:14:06.430
<v Speaker 6>you're talking about the google glass.</v>

2697
01:14:06.431 --> 01:14:09.320
<v Speaker 6>We're going to have to be aware that we're becoming more and more addicted to</v>

2698
01:14:09.330 --> 01:14:12.010
<v Speaker 6>all these closer and closer and closer to it to.</v>

2699
01:14:12.310 --> 01:14:14.620
<v Speaker 4>It might be the whole reason for materialism in the first place.</v>

2700
01:14:14.621 --> 01:14:14.981
<v Speaker 4>It might be.</v>

2701
01:14:14.981 --> 01:14:16.300
<v Speaker 4>That's the pole of materialism.</v>

2702
01:14:16.301 --> 01:14:20.260
<v Speaker 4>Materialism might ultimately be the engine that creates a symbiotic relationship</v>

2703
01:14:20.261 --> 01:14:20.880
<v Speaker 4>between pizza.</v>

2704
01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:22.300
<v Speaker 4>Very positive way to look at them.</v>

2705
01:14:22.510 --> 01:14:24.910
<v Speaker 4>I don't even think it's positive because it sounds pretty negative,</v>

2706
01:14:25.250 --> 01:14:25.640
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2707
01:14:25.640 --> 01:14:27.400
<v Speaker 4>this wouldn't be a lot of shit that's different.</v>

2708
01:14:27.580 --> 01:14:28.181
<v Speaker 4>I do agree.</v>

2709
01:14:28.181 --> 01:14:31.660
<v Speaker 4>I mean technology is increasing exponentially and in some ways it's great and in</v>

2710
01:14:31.661 --> 01:14:34.710
<v Speaker 4>some ways like I feel like we could be using it for better things and when like</v>

2711
01:14:35.340 --> 01:14:35.710
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2712
01:14:35.710 --> 01:14:36.060
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2713
01:14:36.060 --> 01:14:39.830
<v Speaker 4>the drone Amazon delivery system that they've been talking about like alright,</v>

2714
01:14:39.940 --> 01:14:44.110
<v Speaker 4>it's lovely you're bringing a slap chop to an agoraphobic obese coleslaw addict.</v>

2715
01:14:44.111 --> 01:14:45.100
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

2716
01:14:45.190 --> 01:14:47.980
<v Speaker 4>couldn't those drones be used for something more important?</v>

2717
01:14:48.020 --> 01:14:48.671
<v Speaker 4>Well for them,</v>

2718
01:14:48.671 --> 01:14:49.211
<v Speaker 4>I mean their,</v>

2719
01:14:49.211 --> 01:14:50.680
<v Speaker 4>their business is selling people shit,</v>

2720
01:14:50.681 --> 01:14:51.670
<v Speaker 4>so why would they do that?</v>

2721
01:14:51.730 --> 01:14:52.121
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2722
01:14:52.121 --> 01:14:53.760
<v Speaker 4>There's obviously other drones,</v>

2723
01:14:53.860 --> 01:14:56.140
<v Speaker 4>but if they're going to use that drone for their business,</v>

2724
01:14:56.170 --> 01:14:57.220
<v Speaker 4>at least it's cool.</v>

2725
01:14:57.370 --> 01:15:00.340
<v Speaker 4>At least you know you're hanging out in the city and see drones fly by dropping</v>

2726
01:15:00.341 --> 01:15:01.174
<v Speaker 4>off packages.</v>

2727
01:15:01.760 --> 01:15:03.280
<v Speaker 4>That's some more wealthy and shit though,</v>

2728
01:15:03.281 --> 01:15:03.670
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2729
01:15:03.670 --> 01:15:04.000
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2730
01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:05.970
<v Speaker 4>I don't trust those people.</v>

2731
01:15:06.190 --> 01:15:06.880
<v Speaker 4>They're going to break.</v>

2732
01:15:06.880 --> 01:15:08.050
<v Speaker 4>I get nervous about a Roomba.</v>

2733
01:15:08.250 --> 01:15:08.620
<v Speaker 4>Don't know.</v>

2734
01:15:08.620 --> 01:15:08.900
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

2735
01:15:08.900 --> 01:15:12.040
<v Speaker 4>He's reporting back to when is one of I'm going to run out of batteries and</v>

2736
01:15:12.041 --> 01:15:13.900
<v Speaker 4>spiral run into some little kid's stroller.</v>

2737
01:15:13.990 --> 01:15:14.600
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

2738
01:15:14.600 --> 01:15:15.910
<v Speaker 4>The first week it's going to happen.</v>

2739
01:15:16.390 --> 01:15:19.300
<v Speaker 4>You can't tell me those things or feel proof and how about people shooting</v>

2740
01:15:19.301 --> 01:15:19.871
<v Speaker 4>amount of sky.</v>

2741
01:15:19.871 --> 01:15:22.580
<v Speaker 4>You're going to get some crazy rednecks like Colorado.</v>

2742
01:15:22.650 --> 01:15:24.580
<v Speaker 4>They passed a law in some area.</v>

2743
01:15:24.581 --> 01:15:26.730
<v Speaker 4>Colorado allowing you to shoot drones.</v>

2744
01:15:27.510 --> 01:15:28.140
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2745
01:15:28.140 --> 01:15:28.990
<v Speaker 4>They can't do it,</v>

2746
01:15:28.991 --> 01:15:29.980
<v Speaker 4>but they can try.</v>

2747
01:15:30.040 --> 01:15:30.650
<v Speaker 4>You get it all out.</v>

2748
01:15:30.650 --> 01:15:30.881
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2749
01:15:30.881 --> 01:15:32.830
<v Speaker 4>if you have a high speed rifle and it's hovering,</v>

2750
01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:35.930
<v Speaker 4>if you catch it hovering and you have a shitty Ras guy,</v>

2751
01:15:36.470 --> 01:15:37.860
<v Speaker 4>people to tell them at the Amazon drone.</v>

2752
01:15:37.870 --> 01:15:39.190
<v Speaker 4>It's not the full sized drones.</v>

2753
01:15:39.220 --> 01:15:41.590
<v Speaker 4>They're talking about drones period.</v>

2754
01:15:42.330 --> 01:15:43.420
<v Speaker 4>This state,</v>

2755
01:15:43.700 --> 01:15:45.360
<v Speaker 4>Colorado loud.</v>

2756
01:15:45.400 --> 01:15:48.690
<v Speaker 4>I just didn't know if it was possible for the type of yeah,</v>

2757
01:15:48.740 --> 01:15:49.421
<v Speaker 4>you can do it.</v>

2758
01:15:49.421 --> 01:15:49.990
<v Speaker 4>It's been done.</v>

2759
01:15:49.990 --> 01:15:51.640
<v Speaker 4>They've done it with rocket launchers,</v>

2760
01:15:51.641 --> 01:15:53.350
<v Speaker 4>they've done it with like heat seeking missiles.</v>

2761
01:15:53.351 --> 01:15:54.820
<v Speaker 4>I know they've taken drones out before.</v>

2762
01:15:55.210 --> 01:15:56.043
<v Speaker 4>Definitely.</v>

2763
01:15:56.120 --> 01:15:59.440
<v Speaker 4>And if you have a high powered rifle with a scope and it hovers.</v>

2764
01:15:59.470 --> 01:16:01.580
<v Speaker 4>If it's not like moving again,</v>

2765
01:16:01.581 --> 01:16:02.081
<v Speaker 4>if ain't even.</v>

2766
01:16:02.081 --> 01:16:02.831
<v Speaker 4>If it is moving,</v>

2767
01:16:02.831 --> 01:16:03.664
<v Speaker 4>you can lead it,</v>

2768
01:16:03.850 --> 01:16:04.210
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2769
01:16:04.210 --> 01:16:05.410
<v Speaker 4>if you're a really good sniper,</v>

2770
01:16:05.411 --> 01:16:06.244
<v Speaker 4>like one of those marines,</v>

2771
01:16:06.450 --> 01:16:09.370
<v Speaker 4>a lot of the time they're supposed to be a mile up where you can't see them.</v>

2772
01:16:09.730 --> 01:16:10.121
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2773
01:16:10.121 --> 01:16:10.954
<v Speaker 4>that makes sense.</v>

2774
01:16:11.140 --> 01:16:11.800
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2775
01:16:11.800 --> 01:16:12.370
<v Speaker 4>If they're mild,</v>

2776
01:16:12.370 --> 01:16:13.870
<v Speaker 4>well I guess they can be right.</v>

2777
01:16:13.900 --> 01:16:16.100
<v Speaker 4>I mean they could be as high up as they want to know people in there.</v>

2778
01:16:16.101 --> 01:16:16.934
<v Speaker 4>They're often like,</v>

2779
01:16:16.990 --> 01:16:19.120
<v Speaker 4>when they're bombing over in Afghanistan,</v>

2780
01:16:19.121 --> 01:16:20.800
<v Speaker 4>you can't see them so crazy.</v>

2781
01:16:21.820 --> 01:16:24.650
<v Speaker 4>It's such a weird thing that we just accepted that as part of our.</v>

2782
01:16:24.700 --> 01:16:25.780
<v Speaker 4>Our civilization.</v>

2783
01:16:25.810 --> 01:16:26.610
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2784
01:16:26.610 --> 01:16:27.010
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2785
01:16:27.010 --> 01:16:30.190
<v Speaker 4>How far we've come over the past 50 used to be like 10 years ago.</v>

2786
01:16:30.191 --> 01:16:30.761
<v Speaker 4>If someone was like,</v>

2787
01:16:30.761 --> 01:16:31.060
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>

2788
01:16:31.060 --> 01:16:32.890
<v Speaker 4>this drones taking people that you'd be like,</v>

2789
01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:33.110
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2790
01:16:33.110 --> 01:16:34.120
<v Speaker 4>what are you smoking?</v>

2791
01:16:34.360 --> 01:16:38.440
<v Speaker 4>And they don't even try to make it seem like it's just,</v>

2792
01:16:38.590 --> 01:16:40.270
<v Speaker 4>at least the Patriot Act was called.</v>

2793
01:16:40.271 --> 01:16:41.140
<v Speaker 4>The Patriot Act,</v>

2794
01:16:41.770 --> 01:16:42.460
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean,</v>

2795
01:16:42.460 --> 01:16:47.110
<v Speaker 4>like this is they've given up on the Wellington Hellfire missiles.</v>

2796
01:16:47.600 --> 01:16:48.460
<v Speaker 4>Hell fire.</v>

2797
01:16:48.490 --> 01:16:49.330
<v Speaker 4>What does it say up there,</v>

2798
01:16:49.331 --> 01:16:49.600
<v Speaker 4>Brian?</v>

2799
01:16:49.600 --> 01:16:50.080
<v Speaker 4>What did the uh,</v>

2800
01:16:50.080 --> 01:16:51.020
<v Speaker 4>the headline say,</v>

2801
01:16:51.460 --> 01:16:54.040
<v Speaker 4>alright it's town vote on drone ordinance postpone.</v>

2802
01:16:54.070 --> 01:16:54.700
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2803
01:16:54.700 --> 01:16:55.990
<v Speaker 4>someone got a hold of them.</v>

2804
01:16:56.390 --> 01:16:57.820
<v Speaker 4>But yeah,</v>

2805
01:16:57.930 --> 01:16:58.450
<v Speaker 4>they were gonna.</v>

2806
01:16:58.450 --> 01:17:00.420
<v Speaker 4>They were gonna make it so it'd be who shoot drones.</v>

2807
01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:05.793
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2808
01:17:05.850 --> 01:17:06.521
<v Speaker 4>we're so crazy.</v>

2809
01:17:06.521 --> 01:17:08.860
<v Speaker 4>I'm never going to happen because there's bullets are going to fall down and hit</v>

2810
01:17:08.870 --> 01:17:09.870
<v Speaker 4>people and shit like that.</v>

2811
01:17:11.150 --> 01:17:14.390
<v Speaker 4>Well that happens every year on New Year's and these assholes go shooting off</v>

2812
01:17:14.391 --> 01:17:14.841
<v Speaker 4>their guns.</v>

2813
01:17:14.841 --> 01:17:15.800
<v Speaker 4>Bullets land on people.</v>

2814
01:17:16.460 --> 01:17:16.700
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2815
01:17:16.700 --> 01:17:18.620
<v Speaker 4>People die every year of that somewhere in the country.</v>

2816
01:17:18.621 --> 01:17:20.270
<v Speaker 4>So when the world sounds awesome,</v>

2817
01:17:20.271 --> 01:17:21.830
<v Speaker 4>there's something beautiful about that terrible.</v>

2818
01:17:21.831 --> 01:17:23.860
<v Speaker 4>One hundred 50 people die every year because coconuts falling there.</v>

2819
01:17:24.550 --> 01:17:24.860
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2820
01:17:24.860 --> 01:17:27.650
<v Speaker 4>Know far more people die from peanut allergies in this country than terrorism.</v>

2821
01:17:27.680 --> 01:17:28.371
<v Speaker 4>Isn't that crazy?</v>

2822
01:17:28.371 --> 01:17:29.750
<v Speaker 4>Peanuts or a motherfucker.</v>

2823
01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:31.640
<v Speaker 4>That's my argument against.</v>

2824
01:17:31.641 --> 01:17:34.790
<v Speaker 4>We'd like when Dr drew type characters start talking about like the the</v>

2825
01:17:34.890 --> 01:17:37.880
<v Speaker 4>withdrawal symptoms of we like a not so much,</v>

2826
01:17:38.090 --> 01:17:41.020
<v Speaker 4>not for like normal people for one of the peanut allergy freaks.</v>

2827
01:17:41.080 --> 01:17:41.913
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2828
01:17:42.120 --> 01:17:42.501
<v Speaker 4>it will.</v>

2829
01:17:42.501 --> 01:17:44.540
<v Speaker 4>And it's the weeds not kill as many people as peanuts.</v>

2830
01:17:44.570 --> 01:17:45.470
<v Speaker 4>It's not killing anybody,</v>

2831
01:17:45.650 --> 01:17:49.880
<v Speaker 4>but I mean even the people that get these withdrawal syndromes like peanuts or</v>

2832
01:17:49.881 --> 01:17:50.714
<v Speaker 4>worse,</v>

2833
01:17:50.720 --> 01:17:51.590
<v Speaker 4>like peanuts,</v>

2834
01:17:51.620 --> 01:17:54.410
<v Speaker 4>peanuts are a higher percentage of people like the amount of people that are</v>

2835
01:17:54.411 --> 01:17:56.030
<v Speaker 4>getting like really addicted to weed.</v>

2836
01:17:56.270 --> 01:17:57.920
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God isn't even one in a thousand.</v>

2837
01:17:57.921 --> 01:17:58.850
<v Speaker 4>What are the symptoms like?</v>

2838
01:17:58.851 --> 01:17:59.520
<v Speaker 4>Boredom.</v>

2839
01:17:59.520 --> 01:18:00.353
<v Speaker 4>Just bored.</v>

2840
01:18:01.100 --> 01:18:01.281
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2841
01:18:01.281 --> 01:18:02.330
<v Speaker 4>they say that they can't.</v>

2842
01:18:02.331 --> 01:18:03.320
<v Speaker 4>They have to have it.</v>

2843
01:18:03.321 --> 01:18:03.800
<v Speaker 4>They can't.</v>

2844
01:18:03.800 --> 01:18:04.790
<v Speaker 4>I think they're idiots.</v>

2845
01:18:04.970 --> 01:18:05.601
<v Speaker 4>I really do.</v>

2846
01:18:05.601 --> 01:18:08.210
<v Speaker 4>I think a lot of them that talk about being addicted to weed,</v>

2847
01:18:08.211 --> 01:18:08.720
<v Speaker 4>they're idiots.</v>

2848
01:18:08.720 --> 01:18:11.350
<v Speaker 4>I buy the ones that say if they do weeds and they'll start doing coke and then</v>

2849
01:18:11.360 --> 01:18:13.820
<v Speaker 4>they get crazy because it doesn't that start earlier,</v>

2850
01:18:13.821 --> 01:18:14.690
<v Speaker 4>like alcohol,</v>

2851
01:18:14.691 --> 01:18:16.370
<v Speaker 4>like do you have to put it on weed?</v>

2852
01:18:16.490 --> 01:18:17.750
<v Speaker 4>Is the gateway will also.</v>

2853
01:18:17.751 --> 01:18:19.490
<v Speaker 4>It's like why do you have to put it on anything?</v>

2854
01:18:19.520 --> 01:18:23.160
<v Speaker 4>Because what you're really doing is taking something that's innocuous and you're</v>

2855
01:18:23.170 --> 01:18:25.550
<v Speaker 4>just doing your natural escalating whether you would,</v>

2856
01:18:25.610 --> 01:18:26.900
<v Speaker 4>you would do with masturbating,</v>

2857
01:18:26.901 --> 01:18:27.681
<v Speaker 4>with gambling,</v>

2858
01:18:27.681 --> 01:18:28.491
<v Speaker 4>with prostitution.</v>

2859
01:18:28.491 --> 01:18:29.630
<v Speaker 4>You're a fucking crazy person,</v>

2860
01:18:29.670 --> 01:18:30.030
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2861
01:18:30.030 --> 01:18:30.250
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2862
01:18:30.250 --> 01:18:31.190
<v Speaker 4>you're just looking to get nutty,</v>

2863
01:18:31.640 --> 01:18:32.440
<v Speaker 4>nutty.</v>

2864
01:18:32.440 --> 01:18:34.250
<v Speaker 4>And then you blame the weed.</v>

2865
01:18:34.250 --> 01:18:36.080
<v Speaker 4>Then Dr drew's got you on the couch and it's like,</v>

2866
01:18:36.081 --> 01:18:38.450
<v Speaker 4>when did you know that you were out of control?</v>

2867
01:18:38.630 --> 01:18:39.740
<v Speaker 4>The we'd pulled me.</v>

2868
01:18:39.890 --> 01:18:41.030
<v Speaker 4>It was a grip I,</v>

2869
01:18:41.160 --> 01:18:41.780
<v Speaker 4>I needed,</v>

2870
01:18:41.780 --> 01:18:42.960
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't get up without a bond yet,</v>

2871
01:18:43.280 --> 01:18:44.120
<v Speaker 4>like the girl's an idiot.</v>

2872
01:18:44.210 --> 01:18:45.880
<v Speaker 4>But the first time I fucked I was like,</v>

2873
01:18:45.881 --> 01:18:48.380
<v Speaker 4>this is really exciting and I want to do this more.</v>

2874
01:18:48.550 --> 01:18:49.090
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2875
01:18:49.090 --> 01:18:49.680
<v Speaker 4>it can be that.</v>

2876
01:18:49.680 --> 01:18:51.920
<v Speaker 4>And I did a weed and then moved on.</v>

2877
01:18:52.460 --> 01:18:53.150
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2878
01:18:53.150 --> 01:18:53.630
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

2879
01:18:53.630 --> 01:18:54.463
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2880

<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2881
01:18:55.820 --> 01:18:58.250
<v Speaker 4>it's like we were talking about earlier with the whole Fox thing.</v>

2882
01:18:58.310 --> 01:19:03.310
<v Speaker 4>It's like there's teams and the teams don't recognize that it's not an either or</v>

2883
01:19:03.891 --> 01:19:05.540
<v Speaker 4>thing is a lot of weirdness.</v>

2887
01:19:12.530 --> 01:19:13.480

<v Speaker 4>It's amazing.</v>

2926
01:20:24.240 --> 01:20:25.410
<v Speaker 4>The next thing you know you're trying it.</v>

2927
01:20:25.460 --> 01:20:27.810
<v Speaker 4>Next thing you know you're caught in some chemical web.</v>

2928
01:20:27.890 --> 01:20:29.720
<v Speaker 4>We're your actual cells.</v>

2929

01:20:37.121 --> 01:20:38.350
<v Speaker 5>Like life's a bitch.</v>

2933
01:20:38.351 --> 01:20:42.130
<v Speaker 5>And people got to medicate themselves against difficult illness called life in</v>

2934
01:20:42.131 --> 01:20:42.964
<v Speaker 5>various ways.</v>

2935
01:20:45.020 --> 01:20:45.410
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2936
01:20:45.410 --> 01:20:49.220
<v Speaker 4>And I think that the idea that anybody's going to be able to tell you what you</v>

2937
01:20:49.221 --> 01:20:50.870
<v Speaker 4>could do is stupid.</v>

2938
01:20:51.500 --> 01:20:52.940
<v Speaker 4>Some people should take care of one.</v>

2939
01:20:53.360 --> 01:20:55.300
<v Speaker 4>I know that's not a popular thing to say should,</v>

2940
01:20:55.610 --> 01:21:00.610
<v Speaker 4>but I know some people have done some amazing music with heroin and uh,</v>

2941
01:21:01.190 --> 01:21:02.750
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying that they should,</v>

2942
01:21:02.840 --> 01:21:05.630
<v Speaker 4>they absolutely had to do heroin to do that music,</v>

2943
01:21:05.930 --> 01:21:06.763
<v Speaker 4>but they did.</v>

2944
01:21:06.980 --> 01:21:08.000
<v Speaker 4>And the music is awesome.</v>

2945
01:21:08.270 --> 01:21:09.410
<v Speaker 4>So it is what it is,</v>

2946
01:21:09.620 --> 01:21:10.190
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2947
01:21:10.190 --> 01:21:11.090
<v Speaker 4>it's not for everybody.</v>

2948
01:21:11.120 --> 01:21:11.301
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2949
01:21:11.301 --> 01:21:12.230
<v Speaker 4>You're dumb to do heroin.</v>

2950

01:21:12.831 --> 01:21:13.550
<v Speaker 4>It kills you.</v>

2953
01:21:13.550 --> 01:21:15.770
<v Speaker 4>But no liquid fucking.</v>

2954
01:21:16.520 --> 01:21:19.710
<v Speaker 4>We'll look at Devonna did Kurt cobain did,</v>

2955
01:21:19.720 --> 01:21:23.600
<v Speaker 4>one was on heroin and then we use all these drugs as an excuse to in prison</v>

<v Speaker 4>Twenty five percent of the world's prisoners.</v>

<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2987
01:22:07.670 --> 01:22:08.503
<v Speaker 4>freedom.</v>

2988
01:22:09.470 --> 01:22:10.700
<v Speaker 4>All this freedom talk.</v>

2989
01:22:10.730 --> 01:22:11.091
<v Speaker 4>Meanwhile,</v>

2990
01:22:11.091 --> 01:22:13.280
<v Speaker 4>the NSA's just looking at all your Dick Pics,</v>

2991
01:22:13.780 --> 01:22:15.500
<v Speaker 4>look at it every email he ever sent,</v>

2992
01:22:15.501 --> 01:22:16.334
<v Speaker 4>ever.</v>

2993
01:22:16.990 --> 01:22:17.990
<v Speaker 4>I want my guns,</v>

2994
01:22:17.991 --> 01:22:18.521
<v Speaker 4>but I don't.</v>

2995
01:22:18.521 --> 01:22:20.580
<v Speaker 4>I don't care if they're fucking looking at my dick pics.</v>

2996
01:22:20.581 --> 01:22:24.650
<v Speaker 4>I wonder what the fuck is going to happen with this snowden thing.</v>

2997
01:22:24.800 --> 01:22:27.680
<v Speaker 4>They say that he also has some sort of a</v>

2998
01:22:29.240 --> 01:22:34.240
<v Speaker 4>like a stash of really super crazy shit that he will release if anything ever</v>

2999
01:22:34.491 --> 01:22:35.324
<v Speaker 4>happens to him.</v>

3000
01:22:35.450 --> 01:22:35.901
<v Speaker 4>And they,</v>

3001
01:22:35.901 --> 01:22:36.260
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3002
01:22:36.260 --> 01:22:38.330
<v Speaker 4>they have like a code for it.</v>

3003
01:22:38.360 --> 01:22:39.770
<v Speaker 4>Like JFK is the code.</v>

3004
01:22:40.190 --> 01:22:41.300
<v Speaker 4>You have to break into it.</v>

3005
01:22:41.510 --> 01:22:42.830
<v Speaker 4>You have to break like you have to,</v>

3006
01:22:43.580 --> 01:22:44.510
<v Speaker 4>you have to crack it.</v>

3007
01:22:44.730 --> 01:22:46.460
<v Speaker 5>In the hearings in the UK,</v>

3008
01:22:46.461 --> 01:22:48.770
<v Speaker 5>they said they've only released one percent of what he is.</v>

3009
01:22:48.830 --> 01:22:49.790
<v Speaker 5>That's the same.</v>

3010
01:22:50.130 --> 01:22:51.180
<v Speaker 4>How's that possible?</v>

3011
01:22:51.660 --> 01:22:52.320
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy.</v>

3012
01:22:52.320 --> 01:22:53.190
<v Speaker 4>How is that possible?</v>

3013
01:22:53.370 --> 01:22:56.220
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how much more crazy shit is.</v>

3014
01:22:56.460 --> 01:22:58.350
<v Speaker 4>Imagine if we found out that we're not even real.</v>

3015
01:22:59.850 --> 01:23:01.880
<v Speaker 5>They got on a disk somewhere.</v>

3016
01:23:01.910 --> 01:23:03.960
<v Speaker 5>We in the Matrix in the matrix plugged in,</v>

3017
01:23:04.010 --> 01:23:05.000
<v Speaker 5>make sure it's 100 percent.</v>

3018
01:23:05.380 --> 01:23:05.980
<v Speaker 5>Did you see that</v>

3019
01:23:05.980 --> 01:23:07.150
<v Speaker 4>new stuff about the simulation?</v>

3020
01:23:07.151 --> 01:23:08.600
<v Speaker 4>About the Hologram that was on?</v>

3021
01:23:09.070 --> 01:23:09.341
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3022
01:23:09.341 --> 01:23:09.581
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

3023
01:23:09.581 --> 01:23:09.941
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

3024
01:23:09.941 --> 01:23:10.241
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

3025
01:23:10.241 --> 01:23:10.510
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3026
01:23:10.510 --> 01:23:11.160
<v Speaker 4>I'll pull that up.</v>

3027
01:23:11.160 --> 01:23:11.993
<v Speaker 4>It's bizarre.</v>

3028
01:23:12.670 --> 01:23:13.470
<v Speaker 4>The problem with this,</v>

3029
01:23:13.470 --> 01:23:14.303
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3030
01:23:14.740 --> 01:23:17.890
<v Speaker 4>the latest evidence that the universe is a hologram.</v>

3031
01:23:17.891 --> 01:23:19.090
<v Speaker 4>The problem with all this stuff,</v>

3032
01:23:19.120 --> 01:23:21.030
<v Speaker 4>is that a headline?</v>

3033
01:23:22.010 --> 01:23:23.140
<v Speaker 4>I don't understand it.</v>

3034
01:23:23.220 --> 01:23:23.430
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3035
01:23:23.430 --> 01:23:24.161
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't understand it.</v>

3036
01:23:24.161 --> 01:23:25.000
<v Speaker 4>I can understand that.</v>

3037
01:23:25.001 --> 01:23:29.320
<v Speaker 4>I've tried to string theory stuff and this is this the cover of the slate</v>

3038
01:23:29.321 --> 01:23:30.130
<v Speaker 4>science page.</v>

3039
01:23:30.130 --> 01:23:32.860
<v Speaker 4>Do we live in a 10 dimensional hologram?</v>

3040
01:23:33.370 --> 01:23:33.611
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

3041
01:23:33.611 --> 01:23:34.720
<v Speaker 4>I'm just going to shut this off.</v>

3042
01:23:35.680 --> 01:23:40.030
<v Speaker 4>Freaking me out the university and seeing bewildering and times in the past</v>

3043
01:23:40.030 --> 01:23:40.031
<v Speaker 4>century,</v>

3044
01:23:40.031 --> 01:23:42.400
<v Speaker 4>we've learned an incredible amount about the cosmos.</v>

3045
01:23:42.850 --> 01:23:44.440
<v Speaker 4>Thirteen point 8 billion year history.</v>

3046
01:23:44.441 --> 01:23:48.010
<v Speaker 4>It's structure including the number and distribution of galaxies in which is</v>

3047
01:23:48.011 --> 01:23:48.581
<v Speaker 4>really amazing.</v>

3048
01:23:48.581 --> 01:23:50.110
<v Speaker 4>When you stop and think they figured that out.</v>

3049
01:23:51.260 --> 01:23:53.590
<v Speaker 4>There's more gas in the galaxy.</v>

3050
01:23:53.650 --> 01:23:57.430
<v Speaker 4>No more stars than grains of sand on the beaches of the world.</v>

3051
01:23:57.490 --> 01:23:58.860
<v Speaker 4>Jesus crossed.</v>

3052
01:23:58.960 --> 01:23:59.591
<v Speaker 4>Not only that,</v>

3053
01:23:59.591 --> 01:24:03.400
<v Speaker 4>there's a very distinct possibility that the universe is fractal and infinite.</v>

3054
01:24:03.790 --> 01:24:06.700
<v Speaker 4>One of their ideas is that inside every galaxy is a black hole,</v>

3055
01:24:06.701 --> 01:24:08.470
<v Speaker 4>and inside that black holes and other universe,</v>

3056
01:24:09.100 --> 01:24:10.480
<v Speaker 4>I'm not high enough for this conversation.</v>

3057
01:24:11.310 --> 01:24:12.150
<v Speaker 4>It's not high enough.</v>

3058
01:24:12.190 --> 01:24:15.200
<v Speaker 4>It's not possible you can't get high enough because you do,</v>

3059
01:24:15.201 --> 01:24:16.040
<v Speaker 4>you just start talking,</v>

3060
01:24:16.780 --> 01:24:17.830
<v Speaker 4>start talking nonsense,</v>

3061
01:24:18.190 --> 01:24:19.023
<v Speaker 4>but it's a,</v>

3062
01:24:19.240 --> 01:24:21.370
<v Speaker 4>it's a really incredible thing that they've done,</v>

3063
01:24:21.640 --> 01:24:26.640
<v Speaker 4>like trying to study the smallest possible measured components of nature is that</v>

3064
01:24:28.660 --> 01:24:30.550
<v Speaker 4>as they've gotten deeper and deeper with this,</v>

3065
01:24:30.760 --> 01:24:32.950
<v Speaker 4>they've shown that the world is kind of magic.</v>

3066
01:24:33.010 --> 01:24:33.181
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

3067
01:24:33.181 --> 01:24:33.680
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't,</v>

3068
01:24:33.680 --> 01:24:38.680
<v Speaker 4>it's not based on any of the laws of reality that we observe in everyday life.</v>

3069
01:24:39.731 --> 01:24:40.840
<v Speaker 4>Like things aren't solid.</v>

3070
01:24:40.870 --> 01:24:42.090
<v Speaker 4>They're almost all air.</v>

3071
01:24:42.110 --> 01:24:42.230
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3072
01:24:42.230 --> 01:24:43.780
<v Speaker 4>You're not actually touching anything.</v>

3073
01:24:44.050 --> 01:24:44.450
<v Speaker 4>Touch it.</v>

3074
01:24:44.450 --> 01:24:44.680
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

3075
01:24:44.680 --> 01:24:45.513
<v Speaker 4>it's the,</v>

3076
01:24:45.780 --> 01:24:46.613
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3077
01:24:46.860 --> 01:24:47.790
<v Speaker 4>the vibration,</v>

3078
01:24:48.350 --> 01:24:48.940
<v Speaker 4>the forest,</v>

3079
01:24:48.940 --> 01:24:51.890
<v Speaker 4>the charge against is pushing the electric forest or whatever is.</v>

3080
01:24:52.240 --> 01:24:52.421
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3081
01:24:52.421 --> 01:24:53.171
<v Speaker 4>we're going to butcher it,</v>

3082
01:24:53.171 --> 01:24:57.250
<v Speaker 4>but it definitely hardcore go google that from people who know what they're</v>

3083
01:24:57.251 --> 01:24:57.401
<v Speaker 4>doing.</v>

3084
01:24:57.401 --> 01:24:58.234
<v Speaker 4>Not Comedians,</v>

3085
01:24:59.100 --> 01:25:03.700
<v Speaker 4>but like when they talk about quantum theory and they would talk about article</v>

3086
01:25:03.730 --> 01:25:07.840
<v Speaker 4>particles in superposition where they're moving and then still at the same time.</v>

3087
01:25:08.260 --> 01:25:08.561
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

3088
01:25:08.561 --> 01:25:10.420
<v Speaker 4>And some of these particles that are only there,</v>

3089
01:25:10.421 --> 01:25:12.160
<v Speaker 4>they're only there when you observe them,</v>

3090
01:25:12.240 --> 01:25:13.660
<v Speaker 4>observe them,</v>

3091
01:25:13.661 --> 01:25:14.494
<v Speaker 4>they're not there.</v>

3092
01:25:14.980 --> 01:25:16.360
<v Speaker 4>And that's sort of the,</v>

3093
01:25:16.361 --> 01:25:21.070
<v Speaker 4>those are the beginning steps to this study of the possibility of the universe</v>

3094
01:25:21.071 --> 01:25:23.500
<v Speaker 4>is a Hologram and also simulation theory,</v>

3095
01:25:23.501 --> 01:25:27.520
<v Speaker 4>the possibility that what we are in right now is some indiscernible artificial</v>

3096
01:25:27.521 --> 01:25:30.760
<v Speaker 4>reality that we've created in the future and that we don't realize it because</v>

3097
01:25:30.761 --> 01:25:31.594
<v Speaker 4>it's so good,</v>

3098
01:25:31.780 --> 01:25:32.281
<v Speaker 4>it's just,</v>

3099
01:25:32.281 --> 01:25:33.114
<v Speaker 4>it's perfect.</v>

3100
01:25:33.160 --> 01:25:36.640
<v Speaker 4>But we got far enough to create something which we inevitably will.</v>

3101
01:25:36.760 --> 01:25:40.390
<v Speaker 4>That's indiscernible from regular reality and that's why it seems like some</v>

3102
01:25:40.420 --> 01:25:41.260
<v Speaker 4>piece of fiction,</v>

3103
01:25:41.390 --> 01:25:41.650
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3104
01:25:41.650 --> 01:25:42.220
<v Speaker 4>that's why,</v>

3105
01:25:42.220 --> 01:25:42.580
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3106
01:25:42.580 --> 01:25:44.260
<v Speaker 4>Anthony Wiener showing pictures of his Dick,</v>

3107
01:25:44.490 --> 01:25:46.060
<v Speaker 4>like really obvious shit.</v>

3108
01:25:46.360 --> 01:25:48.010
<v Speaker 4>He thinks get weirder and weirder,</v>

3109
01:25:48.160 --> 01:25:48.580
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3110
01:25:48.580 --> 01:25:49.990
<v Speaker 4>and when these things,</v>

3111
01:25:50.020 --> 01:25:52.510
<v Speaker 4>these weird things happen over and over and over again,</v>

3112
01:25:52.870 --> 01:25:55.240
<v Speaker 4>it's almost like they're letting you know,</v>

3113
01:25:55.270 --> 01:25:56.050
<v Speaker 4>like this is just,</v>

3114
01:25:56.050 --> 01:25:56.800
<v Speaker 4>this is a,</v>

3115
01:25:56.800 --> 01:25:57.633
<v Speaker 4>this is a parody.</v>

3116
01:25:58.420 --> 01:25:59.800
<v Speaker 4>We created this,</v>

3117
01:26:00.250 --> 01:26:02.950
<v Speaker 4>this current present from the future.</v>

3118
01:26:03.180 --> 01:26:03.710
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3119
01:26:03.710 --> 01:26:04.491
<v Speaker 4>it's pretty shitty.</v>

3120
01:26:04.491 --> 01:26:05.060
<v Speaker 4>Perfect.</v>

3121
01:26:05.060 --> 01:26:05.450
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3122
01:26:05.450 --> 01:26:06.141
<v Speaker 4>genital warts,</v>

3123
01:26:06.141 --> 01:26:06.530
<v Speaker 4>come on,</v>

3124
01:26:06.530 --> 01:26:07.280
<v Speaker 4>maybe.</v>

3125
01:26:07.280 --> 01:26:07.701
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3126
01:26:07.701 --> 01:26:08.600
<v Speaker 4>but maybe yes,</v>

3127
01:26:08.601 --> 01:26:10.790
<v Speaker 4>because I think there's a yin and a Yang to everything.</v>

3128
01:26:10.791 --> 01:26:13.850
<v Speaker 4>And if you could just all fuck everybody willy nilly would no rubber on and not</v>

3129
01:26:13.851 --> 01:26:14.684
<v Speaker 4>worry about it,</v>

3130
01:26:15.080 --> 01:26:16.940
<v Speaker 4>then it wouldn't be so pleasurable.</v>

3131
01:26:16.941 --> 01:26:21.830
<v Speaker 4>If you could fuck someone who didn't have herpes or just that's the zen idea</v>

3132
01:26:22.140 --> 01:26:23.660
<v Speaker 4>because experience some pain,</v>

3133
01:26:23.661 --> 01:26:25.220
<v Speaker 4>then you've presented it when it's not there.</v>

3134
01:26:25.460 --> 01:26:25.581
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3135
01:26:25.581 --> 01:26:29.540
<v Speaker 4>I think there's a Yin and the Yang to the world just like everything else in the</v>

3136
01:26:29.541 --> 01:26:29.961
<v Speaker 4>universe.</v>

3137
01:26:29.961 --> 01:26:33.200
<v Speaker 4>I think there's a reason why we have evil and it's so that we can appreciate.</v>

3138
01:26:33.200 --> 01:26:33.920
<v Speaker 4>Good.</v>

3139
01:26:33.920 --> 01:26:34.131
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3140
01:26:34.131 --> 01:26:36.890
<v Speaker 4>I think there is a reason why we have bad relationships.</v>

3141
01:26:36.960 --> 01:26:38.810
<v Speaker 4>We can appreciate good relationships.</v>

3142
01:26:39.020 --> 01:26:40.880
<v Speaker 4>I really believed that sounds ridiculous,</v>

3143
01:26:40.881 --> 01:26:43.970
<v Speaker 4>but I think they only people that ever learned are people that experienced both</v>

3144
01:26:43.971 --> 01:26:44.870
<v Speaker 4>highs and lows,</v>

3145
01:26:44.990 --> 01:26:47.240
<v Speaker 4>which is why lottery winners are almost always fucked.</v>

3146
01:26:47.450 --> 01:26:50.270
<v Speaker 4>Which is why people who are born rich are almost always you.</v>

3147
01:26:50.280 --> 01:26:54.170
<v Speaker 4>Have you seen the charts were people that become paraplegic and people that win</v>

3148
01:26:54.171 --> 01:26:54.651
<v Speaker 4>the lottery,</v>

3149
01:26:54.651 --> 01:26:57.950
<v Speaker 4>their happiness goes back to almost exactly after a year.</v>

3150
01:26:57.951 --> 01:26:59.600
<v Speaker 4>It goes back to almost exactly where they were.</v>

3151
01:26:59.720 --> 01:27:00.260
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

3152
01:27:00.260 --> 01:27:02.190
<v Speaker 4>It's like you don't retain that.</v>

3153
01:27:02.320 --> 01:27:07.040
<v Speaker 4>That immense joy or immense sadness tends to come back to the mean.</v>

3154
01:27:07.130 --> 01:27:07.840
<v Speaker 4>It makes sense.</v>

3155
01:27:07.840 --> 01:27:08.190
<v Speaker 4>We're,</v>

3156
01:27:08.190 --> 01:27:09.023
<v Speaker 4>we're adaptable.</v>

3157
01:27:09.050 --> 01:27:09.231
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3158
01:27:09.231 --> 01:27:10.970
<v Speaker 4>we'd like to think that we are what we are right now,</v>

3159
01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:11.833
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

3160
01:27:11.920 --> 01:27:15.770
<v Speaker 4>we are what we are right now is what we are because of the circumstances we</v>

3161
01:27:15.771 --> 01:27:16.490
<v Speaker 4>exist in.</v>

3162
01:27:16.490 --> 01:27:18.140
<v Speaker 4>If our circumstances existed,</v>

3163
01:27:18.141 --> 01:27:19.190
<v Speaker 4>like we were in the Congo,</v>

3164
01:27:19.340 --> 01:27:21.170
<v Speaker 4>digging Colton out of the mountain with a stick.</v>

3165
01:27:21.510 --> 01:27:22.900
<v Speaker 4>That's a reality.</v>

3166
01:27:23.110 --> 01:27:23.660
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3167
01:27:23.660 --> 01:27:24.290
<v Speaker 4>you look at,</v>

3168
01:27:24.290 --> 01:27:27.230
<v Speaker 4>like a friend of mine wrote a book about Montezuma.</v>

3169
01:27:27.500 --> 01:27:28.790
<v Speaker 4>I'm Graham Hancock.</v>

3170
01:27:28.800 --> 01:27:31.160
<v Speaker 4>What wrote a book about a mile that zoom on the,</v>

3171
01:27:31.161 --> 01:27:31.521
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3172
01:27:31.521 --> 01:27:31.611
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3173
01:27:31.611 --> 01:27:31.941
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3174
01:27:31.941 --> 01:27:32.070
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3175
01:27:32.070 --> 01:27:33.970
<v Speaker 4>the incredible shit the aztecs did,</v>

3176
01:27:34.010 --> 01:27:36.570
<v Speaker 4>like really it was a novel and we were,</v>

3177
01:27:36.650 --> 01:27:39.380
<v Speaker 4>we were talking about like living in that time,</v>

3178
01:27:39.381 --> 01:27:39.501
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

3179
01:27:39.501 --> 01:27:39.711
<v Speaker 4>what am,</v>

3180
01:27:39.711 --> 01:27:43.700
<v Speaker 4>I would've been like to live in this crazy barbaric time of human sacrifice.</v>

3181
01:27:43.701 --> 01:27:45.320
<v Speaker 4>And that's all they knew.</v>

3182
01:27:45.740 --> 01:27:46.461
<v Speaker 4>That's all they knew.</v>

3183
01:27:46.461 --> 01:27:50.300
<v Speaker 4>Just like this is all we know is they're going to say the same thing about us</v>

3184
01:27:50.301 --> 01:27:51.590
<v Speaker 4>and about 10 years.</v>

3185
01:27:51.650 --> 01:27:53.330
<v Speaker 4>What was it like to live in that barbaric time?</v>

3186
01:27:54.920 --> 01:27:55.731
<v Speaker 4>Fox News?</v>

3187
01:27:55.731 --> 01:27:57.240
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck was going on there?</v>

3188
01:27:57.410 --> 01:28:00.650
<v Speaker 4>People were watching vaginas on the news while drone bombs were killing</v>

3189
01:28:00.830 --> 01:28:03.200
<v Speaker 4>grandmothers see women to actually think that.</v>

3190
01:28:03.370 --> 01:28:04.880
<v Speaker 4>We're just joking around about that.</v>

3191
01:28:04.940 --> 01:28:08.020
<v Speaker 4>Like that's not really a big deal to show your vagina without intelligence.</v>

3192
01:28:08.030 --> 01:28:08.630
<v Speaker 4>Not Rude,</v>

3193
01:28:08.630 --> 01:28:10.610
<v Speaker 4>but it really does sway men's opinion.</v>

3194
01:28:10.970 --> 01:28:12.440
<v Speaker 4>Totally fucking really,</v>

3195
01:28:12.441 --> 01:28:12.801
<v Speaker 4>really,</v>

3196
01:28:12.801 --> 01:28:13.960
<v Speaker 4>really done beyond that.</v>

3197
01:28:14.360 --> 01:28:14.640
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

3198
01:28:14.640 --> 01:28:14.901
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

3199
01:28:14.901 --> 01:28:15.330
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

3200
01:28:15.330 --> 01:28:16.820
<v Speaker 4>it's the weirdest thing ever.</v>

3201
01:28:16.850 --> 01:28:21.320
<v Speaker 4>Like if you see a girl and even if you have no shot at or whatsoever,</v>

3202
01:28:21.580 --> 01:28:24.020
<v Speaker 4>you even if you don't want to have sex with her,</v>

3203
01:28:24.260 --> 01:28:25.730
<v Speaker 4>you want her to like you.</v>

3204
01:28:26.180 --> 01:28:30.230
<v Speaker 4>If she's super hot and she's wearing some revealing crazy fox news type girl</v>

3205
01:28:30.231 --> 01:28:31.064
<v Speaker 4>clothing,</v>

3206
01:28:31.340 --> 01:28:32.480
<v Speaker 4>it's hypnosis.</v>

3207
01:28:32.660 --> 01:28:34.520
<v Speaker 4>It's not fair for straight men.</v>

3208
01:28:34.521 --> 01:28:35.354
<v Speaker 4>It's not fair.</v>

3209
01:28:35.390 --> 01:28:36.270
<v Speaker 4>Especially for dme.</v>

3210
01:28:36.290 --> 01:28:37.010
<v Speaker 4>Straight man,</v>

3211
01:28:37.010 --> 01:28:39.410
<v Speaker 4>and that's why so many dumb people like Fox News,</v>

3212
01:28:39.750 --> 01:28:40.220
<v Speaker 4>those,</v>

3213
01:28:40.220 --> 01:28:41.480
<v Speaker 4>those fuckers sirens.</v>

3214
01:28:41.630 --> 01:28:42.920
<v Speaker 4>They pull you into the rocks.</v>

3215
01:28:43.490 --> 01:28:44.323
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3216
01:28:44.600 --> 01:28:45.290
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>

3217
01:28:45.290 --> 01:28:46.310
<v Speaker 4>Sirens into the rocks.</v>

3218
01:28:46.311 --> 01:28:47.360
<v Speaker 4>I like that fucking.</v>

3219
01:28:47.720 --> 01:28:48.650
<v Speaker 4>I always think it's weird.</v>

3220
01:28:48.651 --> 01:28:49.640
<v Speaker 4>I think we've talked about this before,</v>

3221
01:28:49.641 --> 01:28:50.810
<v Speaker 4>that that Fox News,</v>

3222
01:28:50.811 --> 01:28:53.480
<v Speaker 4>it's so cool with certain things like family guy,</v>

3223
01:28:53.481 --> 01:28:55.260
<v Speaker 4>like the cartoon Fox News,</v>

3224
01:28:55.810 --> 01:29:00.680
<v Speaker 4>but the company doesn't match the rest of the network because it's all Brian.</v>

3225
01:29:00.681 --> 01:29:01.860
<v Speaker 4>It's all about making money</v>

3226
01:29:02.130 --> 01:29:07.130
<v Speaker 6>and the Fox News with a way to make money in the news is the really obsessed</v>

3227
01:29:07.591 --> 01:29:07.861
<v Speaker 6>people,</v>

3228
01:29:07.861 --> 01:29:08.820
<v Speaker 6>conservative people,</v>

3229
01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.820
<v Speaker 6>the people that are like really into it and listening to like conservative talk</v>

3230
01:29:11.821 --> 01:29:12.270
<v Speaker 6>radio,</v>

3231
01:29:12.270 --> 01:29:15.450
<v Speaker 6>conservative talk radio dominates liberal talk radio.</v>

3232
01:29:15.630 --> 01:29:17.130
<v Speaker 6>I mean I don't know what the real numbers were,</v>

3233
01:29:17.131 --> 01:29:18.630
<v Speaker 6>but I knew back in the day,</v>

3234
01:29:18.830 --> 01:29:20.760
<v Speaker 6>but when Air America came on,</v>

3235
01:29:20.790 --> 01:29:25.790
<v Speaker 6>the idea behind Air America was that we needed a some sort of rebuttal to all</v>

3236
01:29:26.191 --> 01:29:27.240
<v Speaker 6>the right wing,</v>

3237
01:29:27.270 --> 01:29:27.800
<v Speaker 6>right wing talk,</v>

3238
01:29:27.800 --> 01:29:31.050
<v Speaker 6>rush limbaugh and Michael Savage type dudes that were everywhere.</v>

3239
01:29:31.080 --> 01:29:34.770
<v Speaker 6>And every time you turn on the radio you'd have angry white guys screaming about</v>

3240
01:29:34.771 --> 01:29:37.140
<v Speaker 6>immigration and all this crazy nonsense.</v>

3241
01:29:37.141 --> 01:29:37.830
<v Speaker 6>You know?</v>

3242
01:29:37.830 --> 01:29:39.450
<v Speaker 6>And I think that there's,</v>

3243
01:29:40.110 --> 01:29:40.943
<v Speaker 6>there's,</v>

3244
01:29:41.250 --> 01:29:42.420
<v Speaker 6>that's undeniable.</v>

3245
01:29:42.570 --> 01:29:43.403
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

3246
01:29:43.650 --> 01:29:44.483
<v Speaker 6>people are,</v>

3247
01:29:45.640 --> 01:29:46.190
<v Speaker 6>we,</v>

3248
01:29:46.190 --> 01:29:48.390
<v Speaker 6>we're not looking at it for what it really is.</v>

3249
01:29:48.400 --> 01:29:48.571
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3250
01:29:48.571 --> 01:29:50.740
<v Speaker 5>so you look at where talk radio's biggest,</v>

3251
01:29:50.741 --> 01:29:53.900
<v Speaker 5>it's the middle of the country that's all red and they're out on farms and they</v>

3252
01:29:53.960 --> 01:29:54.700
<v Speaker 5>got nothing to do.</v>

3253
01:29:54.700 --> 01:29:56.140
<v Speaker 5>Listen to talk radio.</v>

3254
01:29:56.270 --> 01:29:56.780
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3255
01:29:56.780 --> 01:29:57.670
<v Speaker 6>And you know,</v>

3256
01:29:57.700 --> 01:30:00.080
<v Speaker 6>they're also easily led and if you're really dumb,</v>

3257
01:30:00.081 --> 01:30:00.271
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3258
01:30:00.271 --> 01:30:04.220
<v Speaker 6>if you're feel fearful and that stuff plays towards fear,</v>

3259
01:30:04.460 --> 01:30:05.890
<v Speaker 6>all that right wing stuff,</v>

3260
01:30:05.900 --> 01:30:08.060
<v Speaker 6>whether it's limb by or Michael Savage,</v>

3261
01:30:08.360 --> 01:30:11.660
<v Speaker 6>they're all fearmonger playing towards fear and that's how they make their</v>

3262
01:30:11.661 --> 01:30:12.080
<v Speaker 6>money.</v>

3263
01:30:12.080 --> 01:30:13.790
<v Speaker 6>So Fox News is just,</v>

3264
01:30:13.880 --> 01:30:15.650
<v Speaker 6>that's a great bankable market.</v>

3265
01:30:15.830 --> 01:30:16.880
<v Speaker 6>And then on top of that,</v>

3266
01:30:17.420 --> 01:30:18.253
<v Speaker 6>if you,</v>

3267
01:30:18.290 --> 01:30:18.741
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3268
01:30:18.741 --> 01:30:21.560
<v Speaker 6>you're a guy like Rupert Murdoch who's like super conservative in the first</v>

3269
01:30:21.561 --> 01:30:21.891
<v Speaker 6>place.</v>

3270
01:30:21.891 --> 01:30:23.180
<v Speaker 6>You want to be able to influence culture.</v>

3271
01:30:23.181 --> 01:30:24.860
<v Speaker 6>You have to influence culture with the family guy.</v>

3272
01:30:25.190 --> 01:30:28.190
<v Speaker 6>It's not going to matter whether or not your television shows that are just</v>

3273
01:30:28.220 --> 01:30:29.590
<v Speaker 6>strictly entertainment based,</v>

3274
01:30:29.591 --> 01:30:30.770
<v Speaker 6>are conservative or liberal.</v>

3275
01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:31.790
<v Speaker 6>That doesn't matter.</v>

3276
01:30:31.790 --> 01:30:32.031
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

3277
01:30:32.031 --> 01:30:35.690
<v Speaker 6>But what really does matter is these fucking new shows,</v>

3278
01:30:35.930 --> 01:30:36.890
<v Speaker 6>the TV shows,</v>

3279
01:30:37.030 --> 01:30:38.120
<v Speaker 6>it's just about making some money.</v>

3280
01:30:38.121 --> 01:30:39.080
<v Speaker 6>What's the best way to make money?</v>

3281
01:30:39.260 --> 01:30:41.120
<v Speaker 6>Have people dance with stars.</v>

3282
01:30:41.121 --> 01:30:41.331
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

3283
01:30:41.331 --> 01:30:42.250
<v Speaker 6>it's also about rapid</v>

3284
01:30:42.290 --> 01:30:43.580
<v Speaker 5>tish and the fact that they,</v>

3285
01:30:43.581 --> 01:30:43.821
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3286
01:30:43.821 --> 01:30:46.610
<v Speaker 5>if the news says this thing over and over and over again,</v>

3287
01:30:46.611 --> 01:30:50.360
<v Speaker 5>that's what has the effect on family guy says one sentence that's not.</v>

3288
01:30:51.220 --> 01:30:51.640
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3289
01:30:51.640 --> 01:30:52.261
<v Speaker 6>just becomes.</v>

3290
01:30:52.261 --> 01:30:53.230
<v Speaker 6>So yeah,</v>

3291
01:30:53.231 --> 01:30:53.650
<v Speaker 6>they can,</v>

3292
01:30:53.650 --> 01:30:57.790
<v Speaker 6>they can do incredible things by just repeating things in the news over and over</v>

3293
01:30:57.791 --> 01:30:57.941
<v Speaker 6>again.</v>

3294
01:30:57.941 --> 01:30:58.511
<v Speaker 6>And then people say,</v>

3295
01:30:58.511 --> 01:30:59.830
<v Speaker 6>I thought that this was going on.</v>

3296
01:30:59.831 --> 01:31:00.550
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

3297
01:31:00.550 --> 01:31:02.740
<v Speaker 6>that's God damn.</v>

3298
01:31:02.890 --> 01:31:04.900
<v Speaker 6>But if you just listen to certain news shows,</v>

3299
01:31:04.990 --> 01:31:06.010
<v Speaker 6>you're going to get that slant.</v>

3300
01:31:06.040 --> 01:31:07.120
<v Speaker 6>If you listen to MSNBC,</v>

3301
01:31:07.121 --> 01:31:08.350
<v Speaker 6>you gonna get that left wing slant.</v>

3302
01:31:08.710 --> 01:31:09.790
<v Speaker 6>If you listen to CNN,</v>

3303
01:31:09.820 --> 01:31:10.950
<v Speaker 6>it used to be a left wing side.</v>

3304
01:31:10.990 --> 01:31:11.420
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3305
01:31:11.420 --> 01:31:11.730
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

3306
01:31:11.730 --> 01:31:12.030
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3307
01:31:12.030 --> 01:31:14.170
<v Speaker 5>with Msnbc it's interesting because it is a,</v>

3308
01:31:14.260 --> 01:31:15.660
<v Speaker 5>a kind of left with sand,</v>

3309
01:31:15.661 --> 01:31:17.650
<v Speaker 5>but it's also very much Obama apologist.</v>

3310
01:31:17.980 --> 01:31:21.190
<v Speaker 5>And so if your more left than Obama like I am,</v>

3311
01:31:21.280 --> 01:31:22.190
<v Speaker 5>then you're like,</v>

3312
01:31:22.450 --> 01:31:24.310
<v Speaker 5>fucking give him a pass on everything.</v>

3313
01:31:24.400 --> 01:31:25.233
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

3314
01:31:25.380 --> 01:31:25.690
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3315
01:31:25.690 --> 01:31:28.720
<v Speaker 5>NSA surveillance is not okay just because it's Obama in office.</v>

3316
01:31:29.080 --> 01:31:29.913
<v Speaker 5>I wonder what it is,</v>

3317
01:31:30.010 --> 01:31:30.240
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

3318
01:31:30.240 --> 01:31:32.740
<v Speaker 6>I wonder if it's the bill Hicks choke where you know,</v>

3319
01:31:32.741 --> 01:31:33.690
<v Speaker 6>you get into office,</v>

3320
01:31:33.800 --> 01:31:37.530
<v Speaker 6>they a smoky room filled with industrialists</v>

3321
01:31:37.870 --> 01:31:41.650
<v Speaker 5>and they show you a footage of the JFK assassination from an ankle.</v>

3322
01:31:41.651 --> 01:31:43.960
<v Speaker 5>No one's ever seen any,</v>

3323
01:31:44.140 --> 01:31:44.740
<v Speaker 5>any questions?</v>

3324
01:31:44.740 --> 01:31:47.560
<v Speaker 6>Just want to know what my agenda is.</v>

3325
01:31:48.190 --> 01:31:50.830
<v Speaker 6>I wonder what happens when you get in there because I've heard it.</v>

3326
01:31:51.050 --> 01:31:51.670
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3327
01:31:51.670 --> 01:31:51.940
<v Speaker 5>here's,</v>

3328
01:31:51.940 --> 01:31:52.280
<v Speaker 5>here's,</v>

3329
01:31:52.280 --> 01:31:55.730
<v Speaker 5>here's what I would say about it is you don't get to the point that you could</v>

3330
01:31:55.731 --> 01:31:58.880
<v Speaker 5>get in there unless you've been approved by the business community.</v>

3331
01:31:58.881 --> 01:31:59.170
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

3332
01:31:59.170 --> 01:32:00.010
<v Speaker 5>Rick Rubin was</v>

3333
01:32:00.010 --> 01:32:03.010
<v Speaker 2>behind Obama as a senator maybe even before.</v>

3334
01:32:03.230 --> 01:32:03.670
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3335
01:32:03.670 --> 01:32:04.001
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3336
01:32:04.001 --> 01:32:05.230
<v Speaker 2>as for the beastie boys.</v>

3337
01:32:06.610 --> 01:32:07.480
<v Speaker 2>So the guy</v>

3338
01:32:09.880 --> 01:32:11.710
<v Speaker 2>with the beard as he was,</v>

3339
01:32:11.800 --> 01:32:12.880
<v Speaker 2>he was behind Obama,</v>

3340
01:32:12.920 --> 01:32:13.220
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3341
01:32:13.220 --> 01:32:14.350
<v Speaker 2>even as a state senator.</v>

3342
01:32:14.351 --> 01:32:15.970
<v Speaker 2>So basically deep in this politics thing,</v>

3343
01:32:15.971 --> 01:32:20.230
<v Speaker 2>you say names like Rick Rubin that gets you Brownie points though if you're at a</v>

3344
01:32:20.290 --> 01:32:21.000
<v Speaker 2>party.</v>

3345
01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:21.700
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3346
01:32:21.700 --> 01:32:22.301
<v Speaker 2>but he,</v>

3347
01:32:22.301 --> 01:32:22.751
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3348
01:32:22.751 --> 01:32:23.261
<v Speaker 2>so the.</v>

3349
01:32:23.261 --> 01:32:25.630
<v Speaker 2>Okay was already given for Obama as like,</v>

3350
01:32:25.631 --> 01:32:26.830
<v Speaker 2>he's with Wall Street's,</v>

3351
01:32:26.860 --> 01:32:27.693
<v Speaker 2>that kind of thing.</v>

3352
01:32:28.150 --> 01:32:30.190
<v Speaker 2>And whereas you see the people that don't get that,</v>

3353
01:32:30.191 --> 01:32:30.461
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

3354
01:32:30.461 --> 01:32:31.660
<v Speaker 2>look at Jill Stein or,</v>

3355
01:32:31.750 --> 01:32:32.351
<v Speaker 2>or even,</v>

3356
01:32:32.351 --> 01:32:32.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3357
01:32:32.680 --> 01:32:35.560
<v Speaker 2>Ron Paul had when he was up for the caucus,</v>

3358
01:32:35.561 --> 01:32:38.070
<v Speaker 2>they're changing numbers and shit and uh,</v>

3359
01:32:38.260 --> 01:32:38.501
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3360
01:32:38.501 --> 01:32:42.820
<v Speaker 2>Jill Stein was tried to attend the presidential debate and was arrested and</v>

3361
01:32:42.821 --> 01:32:43.511
<v Speaker 2>locked in a room,</v>

3362
01:32:43.511 --> 01:32:44.344
<v Speaker 2>chained to a charity,</v>

3363
01:32:44.430 --> 01:32:48.220
<v Speaker 2>the entirety of the debate in New York and then released after it was over.</v>

3364
01:32:48.270 --> 01:32:48.760
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

3365
01:32:48.760 --> 01:32:51.310
<v Speaker 2>What was the reason they said it was trespassing because he showed up to the</v>

3366
01:32:51.311 --> 01:32:54.720
<v Speaker 2>debates without a ticket and she even.</v>

3367
01:32:54.770 --> 01:32:56.410
<v Speaker 2>She said she's be like four foot five.</v>

3368
01:32:56.411 --> 01:32:57.610
<v Speaker 2>She was like a 60 year old woman.</v>

3369
01:32:57.611 --> 01:32:59.020
<v Speaker 2>And she said to the armed guard,</v>

3370
01:32:59.140 --> 01:33:00.940
<v Speaker 2>how about you two unchanged from the chairs?</v>

3371
01:33:00.941 --> 01:33:02.020
<v Speaker 2>We're not going to leave the room.</v>

3372
01:33:02.110 --> 01:33:02.591
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>

3373
01:33:02.591 --> 01:33:03.000
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

3374
01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:03.833
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>

3375
01:33:04.120 --> 01:33:05.050
<v Speaker 2>that's our democracy.</v>

3376
01:33:05.051 --> 01:33:05.571
<v Speaker 2>This is the third.</v>

3377
01:33:05.571 --> 01:33:07.180
<v Speaker 2>This is the Green Party presidential candidate.</v>

3378
01:33:07.350 --> 01:33:11.170
<v Speaker 2>What was also really interesting watching people scramble when Ron Paul was</v>

3379
01:33:11.410 --> 01:33:15.280
<v Speaker 2>doing debates and watching the way the pundits on TV,</v>

3380
01:33:15.281 --> 01:33:16.750
<v Speaker 2>which is dismissive openly.</v>

3381
01:33:17.230 --> 01:33:17.680
<v Speaker 2>And they were.</v>

3382
01:33:17.680 --> 01:33:20.650
<v Speaker 2>There was one time where I believe Ron Paul was like in third place and someone</v>

3383
01:33:20.651 --> 01:33:23.500
<v Speaker 2>else's in fourth place and they were concentrating on the fourth place person</v>

3384
01:33:23.530 --> 01:33:27.130
<v Speaker 2>and they like ignored the fact that we're on the list was on the screen and they</v>

3385
01:33:27.131 --> 01:33:27.581
<v Speaker 2>said one,</v>

3386
01:33:27.581 --> 01:33:28.414
<v Speaker 2>two and four.</v>

3387
01:33:29.330 --> 01:33:30.010
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

3388
01:33:30.010 --> 01:33:31.180
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck man,</v>

3389
01:33:31.181 --> 01:33:35.160
<v Speaker 2>it's so transparent and then he's got a son now and people are wondering if his</v>

3390
01:33:35.161 --> 01:33:36.300
<v Speaker 2>son is,</v>

3391
01:33:36.410 --> 01:33:37.300
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to play ball.</v>

3392
01:33:37.301 --> 01:33:40.900
<v Speaker 2>What's going to happen with Rand Razia chip off the old block.</v>

3393
01:33:41.870 --> 01:33:42.970
<v Speaker 2>It's all so weird,</v>

3394
01:33:42.971 --> 01:33:43.804
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3395
01:33:43.870 --> 01:33:48.660
<v Speaker 2>I think that ultimately though with the trends that are happening right now,</v>

3396
01:33:48.670 --> 01:33:53.110
<v Speaker 2>it's like a alternative news sources on the Internet and people getting to these</v>

3397
01:33:53.111 --> 01:33:53.590
<v Speaker 2>places,</v>

3398
01:33:53.590 --> 01:33:57.040
<v Speaker 2>the vice type people that are showing you what was really going on.</v>

3399
01:33:57.070 --> 01:33:58.870
<v Speaker 2>This is really where your cell phones come from.</v>

3400
01:33:58.871 --> 01:34:02.640
<v Speaker 2>This is really what kind of a political uprising is happening in Bahrain.</v>

3401
01:34:02.650 --> 01:34:04.690
<v Speaker 2>This is really what's happening in Syria.</v>

3402
01:34:04.691 --> 01:34:08.200
<v Speaker 2>This is the reason why the administration tried to get you to think that we need</v>

3403
01:34:08.201 --> 01:34:10.810
<v Speaker 2>to take military action and this is the reason why they ultimately back down.</v>

3404
01:34:11.140 --> 01:34:12.720
<v Speaker 2>Like the more that stuff comes out,</v>

3405
01:34:12.730 --> 01:34:15.160
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be so hard to fuck around.</v>

3406
01:34:15.370 --> 01:34:15.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3407
01:34:15.790 --> 01:34:17.980
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be harder and harder to control it.</v>

3408
01:34:18.010 --> 01:34:19.120
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be so hard to control.</v>

3409
01:34:19.121 --> 01:34:22.150
<v Speaker 2>They're not going to be able to know and it terrifies the fuck out of them,</v>

3410
01:34:22.151 --> 01:34:24.310
<v Speaker 2>which is why they're trying to control the Internet more.</v>

3411
01:34:24.520 --> 01:34:24.791
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3412
01:34:24.791 --> 01:34:27.360
<v Speaker 2>they tried to pass those bills that would kind of shut down the,</v>

3413
01:34:27.380 --> 01:34:27.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3414
01:34:27.590 --> 01:34:30.190
<v Speaker 2>make the Internet less free and they failed a,</v>

3415
01:34:30.191 --> 01:34:34.170
<v Speaker 2>it was called Sopa and Pipa where the bills in Congress and people flipped out</v>

3416
01:34:34.171 --> 01:34:39.171
<v Speaker 2>and remember like a Google did a thing on it and everything and a day.</v>

3417
01:34:39.650 --> 01:34:42.850
<v Speaker 2>So it means it's because information is getting out there and it scares the shit</v>

3418
01:34:42.851 --> 01:34:46.120
<v Speaker 2>out of them and they're trying to make the internet chained down.</v>

3419
01:34:46.300 --> 01:34:46.720
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile,</v>

3420
01:34:46.720 --> 01:34:48.640
<v Speaker 2>Google just bought Boston dynamics.</v>

3421
01:34:48.641 --> 01:34:49.474
<v Speaker 2>Did you see that?</v>

3422
01:34:49.660 --> 01:34:50.730
<v Speaker 2>Scariest shit ever.</v>

3423
01:34:50.950 --> 01:34:51.970
<v Speaker 2>Google is skynet.</v>

3424
01:34:52.210 --> 01:34:54.100
<v Speaker 2>They just bought this crazy robot company.</v>

3425
01:34:54.140 --> 01:34:54.973
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3426
01:34:55.530 --> 01:34:56.890
<v Speaker 2>they keep buying crazy shit.</v>

3427
01:34:56.891 --> 01:34:58.040
<v Speaker 2>What else did they buy recently?</v>

3428
01:34:58.080 --> 01:35:00.080
<v Speaker 4>What was the other nutty thing to google bought or they bought.</v>

3429
01:35:00.110 --> 01:35:01.010
<v Speaker 4>They bought ways,</v>

3430
01:35:01.011 --> 01:35:02.030
<v Speaker 4>which is pretty awesome.</v>

3431
01:35:02.031 --> 01:35:02.420
<v Speaker 4>What's that?</v>

3432
01:35:02.420 --> 01:35:05.900
<v Speaker 4>That's a program that's using like a gps that tells you,</v>

3433
01:35:05.901 --> 01:35:06.290
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3434
01:35:06.290 --> 01:35:11.290
<v Speaker 4>real time traffic because what it's doing is it's sending out how slow you're</v>

3435
01:35:11.691 --> 01:35:12.320
<v Speaker 4>going.</v>

3436
01:35:12.320 --> 01:35:13.310
<v Speaker 4>So people know like,</v>

3437
01:35:13.340 --> 01:35:13.461
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

3438
01:35:13.461 --> 01:35:15.770
<v Speaker 4>that's streets only going 30 miles per hour.</v>

3439
01:35:16.070 --> 01:35:17.990
<v Speaker 4>But you're getting the most accurate gps ever.</v>

3440
01:35:18.110 --> 01:35:22.580
<v Speaker 4>So pretty much google buy something that will be able to track you what's</v>

3441
01:35:22.740 --> 01:35:23.330
<v Speaker 4>already dragging.</v>

3442
01:35:23.330 --> 01:35:24.020
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3443
01:35:24.020 --> 01:35:24.790
<v Speaker 4>fact.</v>

3444
01:35:24.790 --> 01:35:27.110
<v Speaker 4>I mean anytime anybody's got some sort of a thing when they're running from the</v>

3445
01:35:27.111 --> 01:35:28.220
<v Speaker 4>cops and they have a phone on,</v>

3446
01:35:28.250 --> 01:35:29.330
<v Speaker 4>they know exactly what you are.</v>

3447
01:35:29.370 --> 01:35:29.480
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3448
01:35:29.480 --> 01:35:31.720
<v Speaker 4>But now it won't even have to be the phone on the car.</v>

3449
01:35:31.730 --> 01:35:34.010
<v Speaker 4>We'll be sending out the signal for sure.</v>

3450
01:35:34.011 --> 01:35:35.150
<v Speaker 4>I mean I think they already are.</v>

3451
01:35:35.210 --> 01:35:35.600
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

3452
01:35:35.600 --> 01:35:35.870
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3453
01:35:35.870 --> 01:35:36.710
<v Speaker 4>when you have like that,</v>

3454
01:35:37.060 --> 01:35:37.940
<v Speaker 4>those uh,</v>

3455
01:35:38.280 --> 01:35:39.440
<v Speaker 4>what is that shit called?</v>

3456
01:35:39.490 --> 01:35:40.323
<v Speaker 4>Where a uh,</v>

3457
01:35:40.720 --> 01:35:41.553
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3458
01:35:42.050 --> 01:35:43.880
<v Speaker 4>what is it when a GM car,</v>

3459
01:35:44.090 --> 01:35:44.923
<v Speaker 4>when you press a button?</v>

3460
01:35:44.950 --> 01:35:45.411
<v Speaker 4>Onstar.</v>

3461
01:35:45.411 --> 01:35:46.010
<v Speaker 4>Onstar.</v>

3462
01:35:46.010 --> 01:35:47.810
<v Speaker 4>I have that in my new car and it scares me.</v>

3463
01:35:47.870 --> 01:35:48.610
<v Speaker 4>They find,</v>

3464
01:35:48.610 --> 01:35:49.710
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3465
01:35:50.030 --> 01:35:51.770
<v Speaker 4>you get in a car accident on star goes,</v>

3466
01:35:51.771 --> 01:35:52.604
<v Speaker 4>we're sending a police,</v>

3467
01:35:52.690 --> 01:35:53.060
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3468
01:35:53.060 --> 01:35:53.600
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3469
01:35:53.600 --> 01:35:54.031
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

3470
01:35:54.031 --> 01:35:56.960
<v Speaker 4>I don't ever view myself as the type of guy that will need to go run and hide in</v>

3471
01:35:56.961 --> 01:35:57.651
<v Speaker 4>a barn somewhere,</v>

3472
01:35:57.651 --> 01:36:02.651
<v Speaker 4>but I would like to have that on the possibility on the table as like I could go</v>

3473
01:36:02.721 --> 01:36:04.010
<v Speaker 4>hide somewhere and you can't anymore,</v>

3474
01:36:04.040 --> 01:36:07.520
<v Speaker 4>but one day when no one can hide,</v>

3475
01:36:07.550 --> 01:36:12.440
<v Speaker 4>including bad people will be forced to reconcile what will be forced to alter</v>

3476
01:36:12.441 --> 01:36:16.880
<v Speaker 4>our opinion or alter our behavior rather to a more evolved state because</v>

3477
01:36:16.881 --> 01:36:18.530
<v Speaker 4>everyone's accountable for their own behavior.</v>

3478
01:36:18.770 --> 01:36:18.891
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3479
01:36:18.891 --> 01:36:19.551
<v Speaker 4>the problem is the.</v>

3480
01:36:19.551 --> 01:36:24.200
<v Speaker 4>I think the largest bad people in terms of a structural society sense are not</v>

3481
01:36:24.201 --> 01:36:25.190
<v Speaker 4>considered bad people.</v>

3482
01:36:25.190 --> 01:36:29.270
<v Speaker 4>I mean the fucking heads of the government and the corporate assholes,</v>

3483
01:36:29.360 --> 01:36:32.330
<v Speaker 4>but don't you think they're considered bad people more now than they ever were</v>

3484
01:36:32.331 --> 01:36:32.790
<v Speaker 4>before?</v>

3485
01:36:32.790 --> 01:36:33.800
<v Speaker 4>Just what we're talking about,</v>

3486
01:36:33.801 --> 01:36:37.790
<v Speaker 4>the impact of Operational Wall Street or the occupy Wall Street movement is that</v>

3487
01:36:37.820 --> 01:36:40.580
<v Speaker 4>one of the things it's done is start the conversation,</v>

3488
01:36:40.610 --> 01:36:45.050
<v Speaker 4>be open up the dialogue about the discrepancy of income discrepancy of wealth in</v>

3489
01:36:45.051 --> 01:36:48.830
<v Speaker 4>this country and make it a topic of discussion in a way that's never really been</v>

3490
01:36:49.310 --> 01:36:50.480
<v Speaker 4>fully explored before.</v>

3491
01:36:50.481 --> 01:36:52.850
<v Speaker 4>It was just everybody knew they were rich people and poor people,</v>

3492
01:36:52.851 --> 01:36:54.140
<v Speaker 4>but now it's kind of quantified.</v>

3493
01:36:54.390 --> 01:36:55.700
<v Speaker 4>Six areas of the Walmart.</v>

3494
01:36:55.701 --> 01:36:56.120
<v Speaker 4>Fortunate,</v>

3495
01:36:56.120 --> 01:36:57.380
<v Speaker 4>the same amount of wealth as the bottom.</v>

3496
01:36:57.381 --> 01:36:58.430
<v Speaker 4>Forty percent of America,</v>

3497
01:36:59.090 --> 01:37:00.430
<v Speaker 4>$125 million.</v>

3498
01:37:00.900 --> 01:37:01.733
<v Speaker 4>They have friends.</v>

3499
01:37:02.480 --> 01:37:03.650
<v Speaker 4>Check this out recently.</v>

3500
01:37:03.880 --> 01:37:07.460
<v Speaker 4>Google by a computer vision robot arms.</v>

3501
01:37:07.461 --> 01:37:09.260
<v Speaker 4>These are companies and what they specialize in.</v>

3502
01:37:09.320 --> 01:37:10.820
<v Speaker 4>Robot arm robots,</v>

3503
01:37:10.910 --> 01:37:11.990
<v Speaker 4>robot wheels,</v>

3504
01:37:12.170 --> 01:37:15.200
<v Speaker 4>robotic cameras and then robotics,</v>

3505
01:37:15.201 --> 01:37:19.160
<v Speaker 4>but the the like the last mergers that they bought like the last eight or most</v>

3506
01:37:19.161 --> 01:37:20.710
<v Speaker 4>of them are robot based.</v>

3507
01:37:20.750 --> 01:37:24.110
<v Speaker 4>Isn't it ironic that their motto when they started was don't be evil?</v>

3508
01:37:24.440 --> 01:37:24.711
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3509
01:37:24.711 --> 01:37:26.270
<v Speaker 4>Look at Google's new robot.</v>

3510
01:37:26.480 --> 01:37:29.390
<v Speaker 4>Watch a Time magazine from December 16th says,</v>

3511
01:37:29.391 --> 01:37:31.310
<v Speaker 4>watch Google's new robot run like hell,</v>

3512
01:37:31.490 --> 01:37:33.560
<v Speaker 4>this is fucking crazy.</v>

3513
01:37:33.620 --> 01:37:34.790
<v Speaker 4>It is a cheetah.</v>

3514
01:37:34.970 --> 01:37:37.220
<v Speaker 4>I mean it literally looks like a Cheetah.</v>

3515
01:37:37.520 --> 01:37:38.360
<v Speaker 4>Wait till you see.</v>

3516
01:37:38.390 --> 01:37:39.500
<v Speaker 4>What does it plan to do with that thing?</v>

3517
01:37:39.530 --> 01:37:39.970
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

3518
01:37:39.970 --> 01:37:40.803
<v Speaker 4>that's a good question.</v>

3519
01:37:40.850 --> 01:37:41.750
<v Speaker 4>But where do you see the,</v>

3520
01:37:41.751 --> 01:37:42.130

<v Speaker 4>the thing run?</v>

3522
01:37:42.830 --> 01:37:43.663
<v Speaker 4>It's insane.</v>

3523
01:37:43.700 --> 01:37:47.450
<v Speaker 4>They have one version of it that I don't think is real at the beginning of it</v>

3524
01:37:47.470 --> 01:37:48.303
<v Speaker 4>where it shows it.</v>

3525
01:37:48.500 --> 01:37:49.333
<v Speaker 4>Pull it.</v>

3526
01:37:49.400 --> 01:37:49.700

01:37:52.491 --> 01:37:52.671
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3530
01:37:52.671 --> 01:37:53.090
<v Speaker 4>But go,</v>

3531
01:37:53.090 --> 01:37:54.230
<v Speaker 4>go to the very beginning of it.</v>

3532
01:37:54.300 --> 01:37:57.300
<v Speaker 4>Go to the very beginning of before you click the link and you can see the,</v>

3533
01:37:57.301 --> 01:37:57.630
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3534
01:37:57.630 --> 01:37:58.950
<v Speaker 4>the idea of the Cheetah,</v>

3535
01:37:59.190 --> 01:38:00.690
<v Speaker 4>the actual robotic Cheetah.</v>

3536
01:38:05.570 --> 01:38:08.030
<v Speaker 4>There's an image when the thing first starts.</v>

3537
01:38:08.210 --> 01:38:08.421
<v Speaker 4>Dude,</v>

3538

01:38:14.030 --> 01:38:14.421
<v Speaker 4>Look at this.</v>

3542
01:38:14.421 --> 01:38:15.254
<v Speaker 4>Prior to that.</v>

3543
01:38:15.260 --> 01:38:15.710
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

3544
01:38:15.710 --> 01:38:16.543
<v Speaker 4>Look at that.</v>

3545
01:38:16.760 --> 01:38:17.720
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck?</v>

3546
01:38:18.770 --> 01:38:19.670
<v Speaker 4>It's like a dead mouse.</v>

3547
01:38:20.020 --> 01:38:22.220
<v Speaker 4>Back at Dab a little so you can actually see the full image.</v>

3548
01:38:23.510 --> 01:38:24.860
<v Speaker 4>That's insane.</v>

3549
01:38:25.010 --> 01:38:26.870
<v Speaker 4>It's a robot fucking cat.</v>

3550
01:38:27.470 --> 01:38:28.580
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if that's real though.</v>

3551
01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:29.960
<v Speaker 4>That looks like a,</v>

3552
01:38:29.990 --> 01:38:32.360
<v Speaker 4>like an artist's rendering or something because actually it's a metal sheet</v>

3553
01:38:32.361 --> 01:38:33.080
<v Speaker 4>ahead.</v>

3554
01:38:33.080 --> 01:38:34.340
<v Speaker 4>But when you watch this thing run,</v>

3555
01:38:34.760 --> 01:38:36.780
<v Speaker 4>they can get sued fast.</v>

3556
01:38:36.970 --> 01:38:37.621
<v Speaker 4>Like a person,</v>

3557
01:38:37.621 --> 01:38:38.880
<v Speaker 4>like a really good sprinter.</v>

3558
01:38:39.360 --> 01:38:42.240
<v Speaker 4>I think they max out and like the thirties or forties,</v>

3559
01:38:42.540 --> 01:38:43.590
<v Speaker 4>like 30 miles an hour.</v>

3560
01:38:43.591 --> 01:38:44.220
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

3561
01:38:44.220 --> 01:38:44.431
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3562
01:38:44.431 --> 01:38:47.700
<v Speaker 4>maybe maybe the fastest guys in the world can get into the forties,</v>

3563
01:38:48.180 --> 01:38:49.410
<v Speaker 4>but these fucking things,</v>

3564
01:38:49.680 --> 01:38:51.480
<v Speaker 4>these things could run like cars.</v>

3565
01:38:51.570 --> 01:38:52.530
<v Speaker 4>What are they going to do with?</v>

3566
01:38:52.740 --> 01:38:54.000
<v Speaker 4>They're going to chase bad people.</v>

3567
01:38:54.120 --> 01:38:55.680
<v Speaker 4>They're going to make sure that the streets are safe.</v>

3568
01:38:57.090 --> 01:38:58.260
<v Speaker 4>These are a robot.</v>

3569
01:38:58.261 --> 01:38:59.094
<v Speaker 4>Super Friends.</v>

3570
01:38:59.680 --> 01:39:00.513
<v Speaker 4>Look at this thing.</v>

3571
01:39:00.540 --> 01:39:04.390
<v Speaker 4>Can you imagine if you're sitting there on the street ready to cross and you</v>

3572
01:39:04.790 --> 01:39:07.890
<v Speaker 4>look left and you look right and you see this fucking thing running down the</v>

3573
01:39:07.891 --> 01:39:10.260
<v Speaker 4>street going 25 miles an hour.</v>

3574
01:39:10.510 --> 01:39:12.360
<v Speaker 4>We need to invest in that magnet company,</v>

3575
01:39:12.390 --> 01:39:12.871
<v Speaker 4>Asap.</v>

3576
01:39:12.871 --> 01:39:16.200
<v Speaker 4>Rocky a magnet to get away from these things.</v>

3577
01:39:16.650 --> 01:39:18.060
<v Speaker 4>If we had a shit load of magnets,</v>

3578
01:39:18.090 --> 01:39:18.923
<v Speaker 4>magnetic pulse,</v>

3579
01:39:19.130 --> 01:39:21.330
<v Speaker 4>just like throwing magnets everywhere to get out of here.</v>

3580
01:39:22.040 --> 01:39:23.430
<v Speaker 4>They probably thought that through.</v>

3581
01:39:23.730 --> 01:39:24.360
<v Speaker 4>Maybe not.</v>

3582
01:39:24.360 --> 01:39:26.850
<v Speaker 4>They're probably using magnesium because lighter.</v>

3583
01:39:27.750 --> 01:39:28.111
<v Speaker 4>Whoa.</v>

3584
01:39:28.111 --> 01:39:28.471
<v Speaker 4>What is that?</v>

3585
01:39:28.471 --> 01:39:28.771
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

3586
01:39:28.771 --> 01:39:29.604
<v Speaker 4>that's how it stops.</v>

3587
01:39:31.290 --> 01:39:32.580
<v Speaker 4>Twenty eight miles an hour.</v>

3588
01:39:32.790 --> 01:39:33.680
<v Speaker 4>Actually a person get out,</v>

3589
01:39:33.690 --> 01:39:34.230
<v Speaker 4>run that,</v>

3590
01:39:34.230 --> 01:39:35.850
<v Speaker 4>but how long I can not run it,</v>

3591
01:39:35.880 --> 01:39:37.080
<v Speaker 4>but like a really fast person.</v>

3592
01:39:37.081 --> 01:39:37.914
<v Speaker 4>Can you ride it?</v>

3593
01:39:38.390 --> 01:39:39.590
<v Speaker 4>I will take its back.</v>

3594
01:39:39.640 --> 01:39:40.473
<v Speaker 4>Choke it.</v>

3595
01:39:41.110 --> 01:39:41.490
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3596
01:39:41.490 --> 01:39:41.990
<v Speaker 4>That's.</v>

3597
01:39:41.990 --> 01:39:45.960
<v Speaker 4>Google owns that now high and it pisses battery acid.</v>

3598
01:39:46.570 --> 01:39:47.250
<v Speaker 4>So sweet.</v>

3599
01:39:47.250 --> 01:39:49.070
<v Speaker 4>I love sweet androids.</v>

3600
01:39:49.140 --> 01:39:49.973
<v Speaker 4>Great.</v>

3601
01:39:50.220 --> 01:39:51.053
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3602
01:39:51.990 --> 01:39:53.880
<v Speaker 4>It's just weird like what are you going to do with that?</v>

3603
01:39:54.060 --> 01:39:55.470
<v Speaker 4>Why don't you guys make phones?</v>

3604
01:39:55.471 --> 01:39:57.640
<v Speaker 4>Like why are you making robot murderer?</v>

3605
01:39:57.650 --> 01:39:58.410
<v Speaker 4>We're going to be that thing.</v>

3606
01:39:58.410 --> 01:40:01.260
<v Speaker 4>We're going to be that thing slave and 10 more years we're going to be that</v>

3607
01:40:01.261 --> 01:40:01.561
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>

3608
01:40:01.561 --> 01:40:04.920
<v Speaker 4>In 20 more years I'll get a download your fucking brain to that and you going to</v>

3609
01:40:04.921 --> 01:40:07.350
<v Speaker 4>run to school and the highway remotely.</v>

3610
01:40:07.380 --> 01:40:11.700
<v Speaker 4>You're going to be like at home in your bed was going to be like a shallow kitty</v>

3611
01:40:11.701 --> 01:40:14.610
<v Speaker 4>pool with wires like the minority report movie.</v>

3612
01:40:14.860 --> 01:40:19.170
<v Speaker 4>You're going to be connected to put on your floaties.</v>

3613
01:40:19.171 --> 01:40:19.740
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3614
01:40:19.740 --> 01:40:19.991
<v Speaker 4>You can.</v>

3615
01:40:19.991 --> 01:40:23.430
<v Speaker 4>They be connected in this pool with dim lighting with these electrodes on your</v>

3616
01:40:23.431 --> 01:40:24.330
<v Speaker 4>head and you're just going to be.</v>

3617
01:40:24.331 --> 01:40:27.780
<v Speaker 4>Your consciousness is going to be inside that Cheetah robot just booking down</v>

3618
01:40:27.781 --> 01:40:30.900
<v Speaker 4>the four or five and now the cheater lots have meetings whether they want to</v>

3619
01:40:30.901 --> 01:40:32.280
<v Speaker 4>keep the humans around any longer.</v>

3620
01:40:32.360 --> 01:40:33.720
<v Speaker 4>Eventually I think we're done with them.</v>

3621
01:40:33.840 --> 01:40:34.021
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3622
01:40:34.021 --> 01:40:36.660
<v Speaker 4>once somebody gets stung enough to actually make one of them conscious</v>

3623
01:40:36.661 --> 01:40:37.440
<v Speaker 4>themselves,</v>

3624
01:40:37.440 --> 01:40:38.011
<v Speaker 4>the beginning,</v>

3625
01:40:38.011 --> 01:40:40.650
<v Speaker 4>it's going to be just human consciousness downloaded into a robot,</v>

3626
01:40:40.890 --> 01:40:42.360
<v Speaker 4>but then some dummies going to decide,</v>

3627
01:40:42.440 --> 01:40:42.860
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

3628
01:40:42.860 --> 01:40:45.330
<v Speaker 4>I want to make my own people and then that's fucked.</v>

3629
01:40:45.430 --> 01:40:46.263
<v Speaker 4>Then we're fucked.</v>

3630
01:40:46.590 --> 01:40:47.810
<v Speaker 4>Isn't it funny that like we,</v>

3631
01:40:47.811 --> 01:40:48.120
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>

3632
01:40:48.120 --> 01:40:50.300
<v Speaker 4>we saw like the terminator and all those movies,</v>

3633
01:40:50.310 --> 01:40:50.491
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

3634
01:40:50.491 --> 01:40:51.271
<v Speaker 4>that's so stupid.</v>

3635
01:40:51.271 --> 01:40:52.104
<v Speaker 4>That's never gonna happen.</v>

3636
01:40:52.320 --> 01:40:53.800
<v Speaker 4>Of course it's going to happen</v>

3637
01:40:54.010 --> 01:40:55.030
<v Speaker 6>and it didn't stop us.</v>

3638
01:40:55.090 --> 01:40:56.680
<v Speaker 6>It's absolutely going to happen.</v>

3639
01:40:56.890 --> 01:40:57.641
<v Speaker 6>If you keep going,</v>

3640
01:40:57.641 --> 01:40:58.150
<v Speaker 6>what's,</v>

3641
01:40:58.150 --> 01:40:59.440
<v Speaker 6>what's going to stop it from happening?</v>

3642
01:40:59.441 --> 01:41:00.274
<v Speaker 6>How about that?</v>

3643
01:41:00.620 --> 01:41:05.500
<v Speaker 6>Can you tell me if people keep going from here from 2013 with the access to</v>

3644
01:41:05.501 --> 01:41:06.670
<v Speaker 6>technology we have now,</v>

3645
01:41:06.970 --> 01:41:08.350
<v Speaker 6>how are you going to stop 100 years from now?</v>

3646
01:41:08.351 --> 01:41:09.580
<v Speaker 6>There'll be an artificial people.</v>

3647
01:41:10.120 --> 01:41:10.990
<v Speaker 6>You're not,</v>

3648
01:41:11.260 --> 01:41:11.680
<v Speaker 6>you're not,</v>

3649
01:41:11.680 --> 01:41:12.550
<v Speaker 6>you're not.</v>

3650
01:41:12.580 --> 01:41:12.890
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

3651
01:41:12.890 --> 01:41:13.780
<v Speaker 6>there's no way.</v>

3652
01:41:14.320 --> 01:41:17.380
<v Speaker 6>There's no way they're going to have that figured out in 100 years.</v>

3653
01:41:17.860 --> 01:41:18.250
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

3654
01:41:18.250 --> 01:41:19.330
<v Speaker 6>we might not see it,</v>

3655
01:41:19.630 --> 01:41:20.870
<v Speaker 6>but our grandchildren are probably see</v>

3656
01:41:21.190 --> 01:41:21.570
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

3657
01:41:21.570 --> 01:41:22.403
<v Speaker 2>and it,</v>

3658
01:41:22.420 --> 01:41:24.950
<v Speaker 2>and we're going to look like idiots.</v>

3659
01:41:24.980 --> 01:41:26.090
<v Speaker 2>Chimpanzees,</v>

3660
01:41:26.120 --> 01:41:26.953
<v Speaker 2>if they have,</v>

3661
01:41:27.400 --> 01:41:30.470
<v Speaker 2>if artificial intelligence has access to like all the information ever,</v>

3662
01:41:30.890 --> 01:41:33.210
<v Speaker 2>we're going to look like just fucking moron.</v>

3663
01:41:33.370 --> 01:41:34.520
<v Speaker 2>Like these things are dangerous.</v>

3664
01:41:35.900 --> 01:41:38.480
<v Speaker 2>They made nuclear power when they didn't know how to shut the plants off,</v>

3665
01:41:38.770 --> 01:41:39.603
<v Speaker 2>just built them.</v>

3666
01:41:39.740 --> 01:41:40.790
<v Speaker 2>We just started doing it.</v>

3667
01:41:41.180 --> 01:41:42.013
<v Speaker 2>The reckless.</v>

3668
01:41:42.140 --> 01:41:46.070
<v Speaker 2>They have enough bombs to blow up everything on the planet 10 times over and</v>

3669
01:41:46.071 --> 01:41:47.030
<v Speaker 2>they keep making bombs.</v>

3670
01:41:47.390 --> 01:41:48.080
<v Speaker 2>They're crazy.</v>

3671
01:41:48.080 --> 01:41:48.261
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

3672
01:41:48.261 --> 01:41:49.880
<v Speaker 2>They have bombs and robots that fly from sky.</v>

3673
01:41:50.020 --> 01:41:50.221
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3674
01:41:50.221 --> 01:41:52.280
<v Speaker 2>they don't need to make the university.</v>

3675
01:41:52.281 --> 01:41:53.860
<v Speaker 2>If we got to get rid of freedom ain't free.</v>

3676
01:41:53.861 --> 01:41:56.270
<v Speaker 2>Sudden freedom ain't free.</v>

3677
01:41:56.920 --> 01:41:57.130
<v Speaker 6>Actually,</v>

3678
01:41:57.130 --> 01:41:59.780
<v Speaker 6>I had a guy say that to me in all earnest recently.</v>

3679
01:42:00.740 --> 01:42:01.670
<v Speaker 6>Freedom isn't free.</v>

3680
01:42:03.190 --> 01:42:03.770
<v Speaker 6>He had it.</v>

3681
01:42:03.770 --> 01:42:04.070
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

3682
01:42:04.070 --> 01:42:05.780
<v Speaker 6>It is by nature.</v>

3683
01:42:06.260 --> 01:42:07.093
<v Speaker 6>Yes,</v>

3684
01:42:07.100 --> 01:42:08.450
<v Speaker 6>that's exactly what it is.</v>

3685
01:42:08.630 --> 01:42:09.360
<v Speaker 6>Freedom.</v>

3686
01:42:09.360 --> 01:42:09.590
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>

3687
01:42:09.590 --> 01:42:10.400
<v Speaker 6>it's free.</v>

3688
01:42:10.400 --> 01:42:11.240
<v Speaker 6>It should be free.</v>

3689
01:42:11.520 --> 01:42:12.353
<v Speaker 6>See,</v>

3690
01:42:12.470 --> 01:42:14.960
<v Speaker 6>that's just because like there's oppression.</v>

3691
01:42:15.290 --> 01:42:17.750
<v Speaker 6>That doesn't mean the freedom isn't still a free thing.</v>

3692
01:42:18.110 --> 01:42:18.860
<v Speaker 6>Freedom just,</v>

3693
01:42:18.860 --> 01:42:19.693
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3694
01:42:20.450 --> 01:42:21.283
<v Speaker 6>God damn,</v>

3695
01:42:22.190 --> 01:42:23.930
<v Speaker 6>we got to go get the baddies Lee camp.</v>

3696
01:42:24.050 --> 01:42:24.883
<v Speaker 6>We do.</v>

3697
01:42:25.430 --> 01:42:27.770
<v Speaker 6>Are there any bodies out there or have we created all the baddies?</v>

3698
01:42:27.830 --> 01:42:28.550
<v Speaker 6>What do you think?</v>

3699
01:42:28.550 --> 01:42:32.450
<v Speaker 6>Do you think it's 50 percent bodies that we've created and 50 percent bodies</v>

3700
01:42:32.451 --> 01:42:33.950
<v Speaker 6>that are actually real that we have to go after?</v>

3701
01:42:34.430 --> 01:42:37.070
<v Speaker 6>Or do you think it's like 100 percent bullshit</v>

3702
01:42:38.810 --> 01:42:39.643
<v Speaker 6>at this point?</v>

3703
01:42:39.950 --> 01:42:43.850
<v Speaker 6>You know when you've got history of us propping up military,</v>

3704
01:42:43.970 --> 01:42:46.670
<v Speaker 6>military dictatorships and then go in and invading them?</v>

3705
01:42:46.860 --> 01:42:47.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3706
01:42:47.520 --> 01:42:48.930
<v Speaker 2>When they're not our friends anymore.</v>

3707
01:42:49.770 --> 01:42:50.630
<v Speaker 2>We used to like it,</v>

3708
01:42:50.631 --> 01:42:51.464
<v Speaker 2>but now</v>

3709
01:42:51.580 --> 01:42:52.121
<v Speaker 6>hilarious.</v>

3710
01:42:52.121 --> 01:42:53.290
<v Speaker 6>Another great Bill Hicks bit.</v>

3711
01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:54.310
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3712
01:42:54.310 --> 01:42:55.143
<v Speaker 6>It's just like,</v>

3713
01:42:55.450 --> 01:42:58.240
<v Speaker 6>it's so weird that all this stuff is a fact.</v>

3714
01:42:58.241 --> 01:42:59.410
<v Speaker 6>All this stuff exists.</v>

3715
01:42:59.590 --> 01:43:01.370
<v Speaker 6>You read things like economic hitman.</v>

3716
01:43:01.390 --> 01:43:02.310
<v Speaker 6>You find out how we really do,</v>

3717
01:43:02.370 --> 01:43:03.590
<v Speaker 2>do run economic,</v>

3718
01:43:03.860 --> 01:43:04.930
<v Speaker 2>conventional economic man.</v>

3719
01:43:05.430 --> 01:43:06.180
<v Speaker 2>Brilliant book,</v>

3720
01:43:06.180 --> 01:43:06.900
<v Speaker 2>the Real,</v>

3721
01:43:06.900 --> 01:43:09.150
<v Speaker 2>the real control of resources all around the world.</v>

3722
01:43:09.151 --> 01:43:10.410
<v Speaker 2>Like how we get away with it.</v>

3723
01:43:10.490 --> 01:43:13.500
<v Speaker 2>And you noticed that one of my videos recently,</v>

3724
01:43:13.540 --> 01:43:14.040
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3725
01:43:14.040 --> 01:43:18.040
<v Speaker 2>I did it on how basically they found out that what they did,</v>

3726
01:43:18.060 --> 01:43:19.020
<v Speaker 2>inventions of economic hit,</v>

3727
01:43:19.021 --> 01:43:19.110
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

3728
01:43:19.110 --> 01:43:19.741
<v Speaker 2>I've worked well.</v>

3729
01:43:19.741 --> 01:43:20.380
<v Speaker 2>You didn't slave,</v>

3730
01:43:20.380 --> 01:43:23.250
<v Speaker 2>you'd save countries with a debt and now they done it.</v>

3731
01:43:23.251 --> 01:43:25.830
<v Speaker 2>The American people with student loans and mortgages and shit.</v>

3732
01:43:25.860 --> 01:43:26.790
<v Speaker 2>So they've been slaved.</v>

3733
01:43:26.820 --> 01:43:27.960
<v Speaker 2>The American people with debt.</v>

3734
01:43:28.590 --> 01:43:29.640
<v Speaker 6>Well you say that,</v>

3735
01:43:29.641 --> 01:43:33.120
<v Speaker 6>but I say they gave them the opportunity for a nice car camp.</v>

3736
01:43:33.121 --> 01:43:36.660
<v Speaker 6>There's something about going to a job in a nice new car.</v>

3737
01:43:36.661 --> 01:43:40.580
<v Speaker 6>And if you just put a $100 down at $1,500 alone,</v>

3738
01:43:40.600 --> 01:43:41.550
<v Speaker 6>aren't that smart?</v>

3739
01:43:41.730 --> 01:43:43.530
<v Speaker 6>A lot of them you say that Lee camp.</v>

3740
01:43:43.590 --> 01:43:46.650
<v Speaker 6>But I think that Alexis can make you feel better,</v>

3741
01:43:47.270 --> 01:43:48.103
<v Speaker 6>I think.</v>

3742
01:43:48.130 --> 01:43:49.650
<v Speaker 6>I don't think I was arguing at camp.</v>

3743
01:43:50.160 --> 01:43:53.030
<v Speaker 6>I think that having that loan I was arguing to students,</v>

3744
01:43:53.700 --> 01:43:54.590
<v Speaker 6>student loans.</v>

3745
01:43:54.620 --> 01:43:57.290
<v Speaker 6>People think they can pay them off and then they can't for 50 years.</v>

3746
01:43:57.320 --> 01:43:58.011
<v Speaker 6>That's another thing.</v>

3747
01:43:58.011 --> 01:44:02.630
<v Speaker 6>It's like I believe that education should be available and free to all of our</v>

3748
01:44:02.631 --> 01:44:03.021
<v Speaker 6>people.</v>

3749
01:44:03.021 --> 01:44:05.270
<v Speaker 6>I think it should be one of those things that we encourage.</v>

3750
01:44:05.300 --> 01:44:06.650
<v Speaker 6>We need more smart people,</v>

3751
01:44:06.651 --> 01:44:07.461
<v Speaker 6>more smart people,</v>

3752
01:44:07.461 --> 01:44:09.470
<v Speaker 6>more educated people equals less losers.</v>

3753
01:44:09.950 --> 01:44:10.740
<v Speaker 6>That's,</v>

3754
01:44:10.740 --> 01:44:11.840
<v Speaker 6>that's a better society.</v>

3755
01:44:11.841 --> 01:44:13.790
<v Speaker 6>It's a better we will be better off,</v>

3756
01:44:14.120 --> 01:44:19.120
<v Speaker 6>but God damn the idea that you go to school and it costs you a quarter million</v>

3757
01:44:20.481 --> 01:44:22.370
<v Speaker 6>dollars by the time you're out and you're fucked,</v>

3758
01:44:22.371 --> 01:44:23.420
<v Speaker 6>you're making $50,000</v>

3759
01:44:23.470 --> 01:44:27.370
<v Speaker 5>and you and you made that decision at 18 and then your 24 realizing you don't</v>

3760
01:44:27.371 --> 01:44:28.204
<v Speaker 5>want to be a lawyer anymore.</v>

3761
01:44:28.390 --> 01:44:29.230
<v Speaker 6>Oh fuck.</v>

3762
01:44:29.460 --> 01:44:30.180
<v Speaker 6>You're fucked.</v>

3763
01:44:30.180 --> 01:44:31.710
<v Speaker 6>And it's a shitty feeling to like you.</v>

3764
01:44:31.711 --> 01:44:32.461
<v Speaker 6>You're trapped.</v>

3765
01:44:32.461 --> 01:44:34.140
<v Speaker 6>You're sucked into the web of the system.</v>

3766
01:44:34.560 --> 01:44:34.741
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

3767
01:44:34.741 --> 01:44:37.680
<v Speaker 6>I have friends that have student loans that are just mind boggling.</v>

3768
01:44:37.920 --> 01:44:38.731
<v Speaker 6>He talked to them about it.</v>

3769
01:44:38.731 --> 01:44:38.851
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

3770
01:44:38.851 --> 01:44:39.750
<v Speaker 6>how are you going to pay it off?</v>

3771
01:44:39.751 --> 01:44:39.871
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

3772
01:44:39.871 --> 01:44:40.704
<v Speaker 6>I'm never going to pay it off.</v>

3773
01:44:41.010 --> 01:44:41.731
<v Speaker 6>You really know.</v>

3774
01:44:41.731 --> 01:44:43.080
<v Speaker 6>You're never going to pay it up like you,</v>

3775
01:44:43.130 --> 01:44:43.491
<v Speaker 6>you have.</v>

3776
01:44:43.491 --> 01:44:43.720
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

3777
01:44:43.720 --> 01:44:44.010
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>

3778
01:44:44.010 --> 01:44:44.843
<v Speaker 6>I said thank God I,</v>

3779
01:44:44.870 --> 01:44:45.840
<v Speaker 6>I pay as I went.</v>

3780
01:44:45.990 --> 01:44:46.650
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

3781
01:44:46.650 --> 01:44:47.401
<v Speaker 6>it's so crazy.</v>

3782
01:44:47.401 --> 01:44:47.881
<v Speaker 6>Some people,</v>

3783
01:44:47.881 --> 01:44:51.770
<v Speaker 6>especially if you do like medical school or something crazy law school,</v>

3784
01:44:51.790 --> 01:44:52.650
<v Speaker 6>it's very expensive.</v>

3785
01:44:53.070 --> 01:44:53.361
<v Speaker 6>The,</v>

3786
01:44:53.361 --> 01:44:54.300
<v Speaker 6>the number,</v>

3787
01:44:54.301 --> 01:44:57.720
<v Speaker 6>the actual number you are you're in the hole for before you even get started in</v>

3788
01:44:57.721 --> 01:44:58.554
<v Speaker 6>the game of life.</v>

3789
01:44:58.980 --> 01:45:01.530
<v Speaker 6>And now there's all these fraud schools that trick people into thinking they're</v>

3790
01:45:01.531 --> 01:45:04.280
<v Speaker 6>going to get some great degree and it's gotta be a better way than that.</v>

3791
01:45:04.330 --> 01:45:06.180
<v Speaker 6>It's gotta be a way to have education free.</v>

3792
01:45:06.900 --> 01:45:08.280
<v Speaker 6>It seems like the most important thing.</v>

3793
01:45:08.310 --> 01:45:09.080
<v Speaker 6>Education,</v>

3794
01:45:09.080 --> 01:45:09.913
<v Speaker 6>healthcare,</v>

3795
01:45:09.990 --> 01:45:10.823
<v Speaker 6>police,</v>

3796
01:45:11.220 --> 01:45:11.641
<v Speaker 6>the Internet,</v>

3797
01:45:11.641 --> 01:45:13.020
<v Speaker 6>pretty much the newest education.</v>

3798
01:45:13.021 --> 01:45:15.240
<v Speaker 6>If you could focus and make sure you're like,</v>

3799
01:45:15.241 --> 01:45:19.500
<v Speaker 6>just sit there and try to learn different techniques on like youtube and beyonce</v>

3800
01:45:19.710 --> 01:45:21.460
<v Speaker 6>and that's just now I think the,</v>

3801
01:45:21.461 --> 01:45:21.571
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3802
01:45:21.571 --> 01:45:22.440
<v Speaker 6>the real internet.</v>

3803
01:45:22.710 --> 01:45:24.540
<v Speaker 6>I was listening to this podcast,</v>

3804
01:45:25.080 --> 01:45:28.530
<v Speaker 6>I forgot that I think it's radio lab until radio lab or something like that.</v>

3805
01:45:28.980 --> 01:45:33.660
<v Speaker 6>And they were talking about human neural interfaces and that the ultimate goal</v>

3806
01:45:33.810 --> 01:45:36.510
<v Speaker 6>is what they're working on right now is there.</v>

3807
01:45:37.290 --> 01:45:42.290
<v Speaker 6>We have already the ability to take a phone and answer,</v>

3808
01:45:43.110 --> 01:45:44.460
<v Speaker 6>ask a question to the phone,</v>

3809
01:45:44.650 --> 01:45:47.250
<v Speaker 6>speak right into it and give you an answer in a couple of seconds.</v>

3810
01:45:47.630 --> 01:45:48.490
<v Speaker 6>But there's going to,</v>

3811
01:45:48.540 --> 01:45:50.580
<v Speaker 6>they're going to have within a decade,</v>

3812
01:45:50.581 --> 01:45:51.270
<v Speaker 6>two decades,</v>

3813
01:45:51.270 --> 01:45:52.830
<v Speaker 6>there's going to be one less step.</v>

3814
01:45:53.070 --> 01:45:54.330
<v Speaker 6>You just going to have that information,</v>

3815
01:45:54.350 --> 01:45:56.100
<v Speaker 6>you just think you're going to get it,</v>

3816
01:45:56.990 --> 01:45:58.360
<v Speaker 6>it's going to be there and you know,</v>

3817
01:45:58.590 --> 01:46:01.170
<v Speaker 6>it might actually even come in a form of knowledge,</v>

3818
01:46:01.320 --> 01:46:03.060
<v Speaker 6>like it won't be a written word that you have to read,</v>

3819
01:46:03.270 --> 01:46:04.680
<v Speaker 6>like it'll come in a formal,</v>

3820
01:46:04.681 --> 01:46:07.890
<v Speaker 6>there'll be able to break down what our parcels of knowledge and information</v>

3821
01:46:08.220 --> 01:46:10.500
<v Speaker 6>because they've already figured out that they can plant information,</v>

3822
01:46:10.770 --> 01:46:12.080
<v Speaker 6>they could plant information to brand,</v>

3823
01:46:12.081 --> 01:46:13.410
<v Speaker 6>they could plant false memories.</v>

3824
01:46:13.770 --> 01:46:15.120
<v Speaker 6>So if they can plant false memories,</v>

3825
01:46:15.290 --> 01:46:16.530
<v Speaker 6>that's another scary thing.</v>

3826
01:46:16.590 --> 01:46:17.970
<v Speaker 6>If once you take those memories,</v>

3827
01:46:17.971 --> 01:46:21.060
<v Speaker 6>you have control of everything before you go to a place like that.</v>

3828
01:46:21.061 --> 01:46:23.220
<v Speaker 6>Fucking what was that Arnold Schwarzenegger movie?</v>

3829
01:46:23.250 --> 01:46:23.940
<v Speaker 6>Total recall.</v>

3830
01:46:23.940 --> 01:46:24.390
<v Speaker 6>Recall,</v>

3831
01:46:24.390 --> 01:46:27.540
<v Speaker 6>they hook you up with some machine and you just live like a baller.</v>

3832
01:46:29.100 --> 01:46:30.010
<v Speaker 6>That's the matrix.</v>

3833
01:46:30.840 --> 01:46:31.800
<v Speaker 6>That's the real,</v>

3834
01:46:31.860 --> 01:46:32.790
<v Speaker 6>the real hologram.</v>

3835
01:46:34.460 --> 01:46:38.150
<v Speaker 5>But like they have those been the Pentagon has spent millions and millions on</v>

3836
01:46:38.151 --> 01:46:40.170
<v Speaker 5>pills that help erase memories is for,</v>

3837
01:46:40.170 --> 01:46:40.630
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3838
01:46:40.630 --> 01:46:41.810
<v Speaker 6>for soldiers and things.</v>

3839
01:46:41.950 --> 01:46:42.071
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

3840
01:46:42.071 --> 01:46:44.470
<v Speaker 6>they've also tried a lot of shit that didn't work like LSD,</v>

3841
01:46:45.520 --> 01:46:46.720
<v Speaker 6>lsd initially.</v>

3842
01:46:46.721 --> 01:46:50.070
<v Speaker 6>The idea was that it would be a truth serum that would capture the</v>

3843
01:46:50.070 --> 01:46:50.401
<v Speaker 2>enemy,</v>

3844
01:46:50.401 --> 01:46:51.330
<v Speaker 2>give them Lsd,</v>

3845
01:46:51.331 --> 01:46:52.680
<v Speaker 2>and they would be forced to tell the truth.</v>

3846
01:46:52.760 --> 01:46:53.100
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3847
01:46:53.100 --> 01:46:55.620
<v Speaker 2>Not so much especially.</v>

3848
01:46:55.621 --> 01:46:58.260
<v Speaker 2>They didn't even understand the dosage was fun serum.</v>

3849
01:46:58.680 --> 01:47:00.650
<v Speaker 2>They were giving people every on bottles were acid,</v>

3850
01:47:02.120 --> 01:47:06.420
<v Speaker 2>drink this and tell us the truth and they would lose their fucking marbles and</v>

3851
01:47:06.421 --> 01:47:06.871
<v Speaker 2>then they said,</v>

3852
01:47:06.871 --> 01:47:07.201
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

3853
01:47:07.201 --> 01:47:07.471
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

3854
01:47:07.471 --> 01:47:07.801
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

3855
01:47:07.801 --> 01:47:08.670
<v Speaker 2>this doesn't work for that,</v>

3856
01:47:08.671 --> 01:47:10.050
<v Speaker 2>but maybe it'll work for this.</v>

3857
01:47:10.080 --> 01:47:13.240
<v Speaker 2>It's probably like one guy who really loved acid and he wanted just to continue</v>

3858
01:47:13.241 --> 01:47:14.074
<v Speaker 2>that research.</v>

3859
01:47:14.430 --> 01:47:15.263
<v Speaker 2>They said,</v>

3860
01:47:15.270 --> 01:47:17.970
<v Speaker 2>how about we do this when our guys get captured,</v>

3861
01:47:17.971 --> 01:47:18.691
<v Speaker 2>they'll take acid.</v>

3862
01:47:18.691 --> 01:47:20.820
<v Speaker 2>That way they won't be able to divulge any secrets.</v>

3863
01:47:20.910 --> 01:47:22.040
<v Speaker 2>So that was doing that.</v>

3864
01:47:22.470 --> 01:47:26.850
<v Speaker 2>Those are the two options and then somewhere around the late 19 sixties they</v>

3865
01:47:26.851 --> 01:47:30.120
<v Speaker 2>realized they had a problem because acid really permeated the entire culture and</v>

3866
01:47:30.121 --> 01:47:33.270
<v Speaker 2>start changing the way people were thinking about opening minds and so many</v>

3867
01:47:33.271 --> 01:47:37.590
<v Speaker 2>people that Timothy leary fans were tuning in and dropping out and they were.</v>

3868
01:47:37.740 --> 01:47:40.330
<v Speaker 2>People are getting to a point where that was a,</v>

3869
01:47:40.390 --> 01:47:40.920
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3870
01:47:40.920 --> 01:47:42.540
<v Speaker 2>there was ways to think there was,</v>

3871
01:47:42.541 --> 01:47:43.560
<v Speaker 2>you could be a Republican,</v>

3872
01:47:43.561 --> 01:47:44.640
<v Speaker 2>you can be a Democrat,</v>

3873
01:47:44.641 --> 01:47:47.670
<v Speaker 2>you could be a humanitarian or you could be a psychedelic adventure.</v>

3874
01:47:48.040 --> 01:47:49.350
<v Speaker 2>All of the sudden that's an option too.</v>

3875
01:47:49.360 --> 01:47:49.740
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3876
01:47:49.740 --> 01:47:51.330
<v Speaker 2>And then people were diving into that and they were like,</v>

3877
01:47:51.331 --> 01:47:51.481
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3878
01:47:51.481 --> 01:47:56.130
<v Speaker 2>these people have really good arguments and they obviously are impossible to,</v>

3879
01:47:56.170 --> 01:47:56.671
<v Speaker 2>to mind.</v>

3880
01:47:56.671 --> 01:47:57.000
<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>

3881
01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:58.860
<v Speaker 2>And all of a sudden they're against the Vietnam war.</v>

3882
01:47:58.920 --> 01:47:59.753
<v Speaker 2>They're against everything.</v>

3883
01:48:00.030 --> 01:48:00.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3884
01:48:00.190 --> 01:48:00.660
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

3885
01:48:00.660 --> 01:48:00.931
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3886
01:48:00.931 --> 01:48:01.920
<v Speaker 2>like the weather underground.</v>

3887
01:48:01.921 --> 01:48:05.100
<v Speaker 2>They wanted to have orgies and fucking blow up the government.</v>

3888
01:48:05.430 --> 01:48:05.641
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3889
01:48:05.641 --> 01:48:06.350
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

3890
01:48:06.350 --> 01:48:10.200
<v Speaker 2>you get a lot of weirdness when you start throwing an acid into the mix.</v>

3891
01:48:10.260 --> 01:48:11.750
<v Speaker 2>So they're like around 1979.</v>

3892
01:48:11.780 --> 01:48:12.330
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

3893
01:48:12.330 --> 01:48:13.620
<v Speaker 2>let's just make all this shit illegal.</v>

3894
01:48:13.920 --> 01:48:15.900
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to believe that up until 1970,</v>

3895
01:48:16.230 --> 01:48:17.100
<v Speaker 2>everything was legal.</v>

3896
01:48:17.550 --> 01:48:19.830
<v Speaker 2>Marijuana was illegal since the 19 thirties.</v>

3897
01:48:20.190 --> 01:48:21.150
<v Speaker 2>But besides the marijuana,</v>

3898
01:48:21.151 --> 01:48:22.080
<v Speaker 2>like mushrooms,</v>

3899
01:48:22.081 --> 01:48:22.800
<v Speaker 2>Peyote,</v>

3900
01:48:22.800 --> 01:48:23.281
<v Speaker 2>mushrooms,</v>

3901
01:48:23.281 --> 01:48:23.550
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3902
01:48:23.550 --> 01:48:24.420
<v Speaker 2>cocaine,</v>

3903
01:48:24.720 --> 01:48:26.850
<v Speaker 2>all that shit was legal until 1970.</v>

3904
01:48:27.420 --> 01:48:28.051
<v Speaker 2>That's weird.</v>

3905
01:48:28.051 --> 01:48:28.620
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

3906
01:48:28.620 --> 01:48:29.453
<v Speaker 2>Maybe not cocaine.</v>

3907
01:48:29.790 --> 01:48:30.121
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

3908
01:48:30.121 --> 01:48:31.470
<v Speaker 2>Definitely a psychedelics,</v>

3909
01:48:32.100 --> 01:48:35.190
<v Speaker 2>that's what they're going to say about like Salvia cigarettes.</v>

3910
01:48:35.191 --> 01:48:37.020
<v Speaker 2>Alcohol and 20 years from now,</v>

3911
01:48:37.260 --> 01:48:38.093
<v Speaker 2>10 years,</v>

3912
01:48:38.220 --> 01:48:38.401
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3913
01:48:38.401 --> 01:48:40.440
<v Speaker 2>they've already done it with Salvia and a lot of places,</v>

3914
01:48:40.441 --> 01:48:41.820
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think they're going to say with cigarettes,</v>

3915
01:48:41.850 --> 01:48:44.190
<v Speaker 2>thank God they make a lot of money from alcohol because they're not getting rid</v>

3916
01:48:44.191 --> 01:48:44.401
<v Speaker 2>of that.</v>

3917
01:48:44.401 --> 01:48:45.360
<v Speaker 2>As long as they make money.</v>

3918
01:48:45.440 --> 01:48:45.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3919
01:48:45.690 --> 01:48:46.530
<v Speaker 2>we need something.</v>

3920
01:48:46.710 --> 01:48:47.550
<v Speaker 2>You can't do that.</v>

3921
01:48:47.610 --> 01:48:49.050
<v Speaker 2>We're going to be reprogrammed to beat drunk.</v>

3922
01:48:49.080 --> 01:48:50.100
<v Speaker 2>Like I want to be drunk right now.</v>

3923
01:48:50.110 --> 01:48:50.550
<v Speaker 2>Dink.</v>

3924
01:48:50.550 --> 01:48:53.940
<v Speaker 2>And then you know like it's gonna fuck with your brain so your brain thinks</v>

3925
01:48:53.941 --> 01:48:54.520
<v Speaker 2>you're drunk.</v>

3926
01:48:54.520 --> 01:48:57.390
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be like an on off switch and we're going to start programming.</v>

3927
01:48:57.400 --> 01:48:59.940
<v Speaker 2>What I think they're going to do is have like a Jack Daniels Patch.</v>

3928
01:49:00.300 --> 01:49:02.460
<v Speaker 2>Slap it on your stomach and you don't have to drink.</v>

3929
01:49:02.461 --> 01:49:03.390
<v Speaker 2>You don't get shitty breath.</v>

3930
01:49:03.420 --> 01:49:04.650
<v Speaker 2>You just put a patch on your stomach.</v>

3931
01:49:04.670 --> 01:49:06.090
<v Speaker 2>It's so much less cool at bars,</v>

3932
01:49:06.740 --> 01:49:09.960
<v Speaker 2>solely not quoted on your stomach a little bit.</v>

3933
01:49:10.450 --> 01:49:12.690
<v Speaker 2>Someone's trying to find out what the actual drugs were.</v>

3934
01:49:12.780 --> 01:49:13.261
<v Speaker 2>Hey Baby,</v>

3935
01:49:13.261 --> 01:49:14.640
<v Speaker 2>you want to hang out and put patches on.</v>

3936
01:49:15.050 --> 01:49:20.050
<v Speaker 2>You see that Kanye west a remake video that a seth rogen did and that,</v>

3937
01:49:21.080 --> 01:49:21.811
<v Speaker 2>that other guys,</v>

3938
01:49:21.811 --> 01:49:22.300
<v Speaker 2>for instance.</v>

3939
01:49:22.300 --> 01:49:22.770
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3940
01:49:22.770 --> 01:49:23.670
<v Speaker 2>I heard it was really funny though.</v>

3941
01:49:23.700 --> 01:49:23.911
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3942
01:49:23.911 --> 01:49:24.810
<v Speaker 2>Cocaine was one.</v>

3943
01:49:24.840 --> 01:49:27.480
<v Speaker 2>Cocaine was illegal until 1970.</v>

3944
01:49:27.570 --> 01:49:28.170
<v Speaker 2>You mean legal?</v>

3945
01:49:28.170 --> 01:49:28.930
<v Speaker 2>Legal rather?</v>

3946
01:49:28.930 --> 01:49:30.330
<v Speaker 2>Until 1970.</v>

3947
01:49:30.690 --> 01:49:30.931
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

3948
01:49:30.931 --> 01:49:31.764
<v Speaker 2>Freud was picking the.</v>

3949
01:49:31.830 --> 01:49:33.000
<v Speaker 2>Morphine was legal.</v>

3950
01:49:33.150 --> 01:49:34.320
<v Speaker 2>Codene was legal.</v>

3951
01:49:34.620 --> 01:49:35.453
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3952
01:49:35.580 --> 01:49:37.590
<v Speaker 2>Remember how you used to be able to get cody with Nyquil?</v>

3953
01:49:38.130 --> 01:49:38.580
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3954
01:49:38.580 --> 01:49:39.301
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

3955
01:49:39.301 --> 01:49:42.060
<v Speaker 2>I was sick once and I took some Nyquil and I've never felt better in my whole</v>

3956
01:49:42.061 --> 01:49:42.894
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

3957
01:49:43.110 --> 01:49:44.100
<v Speaker 2>It was beautiful.</v>

3958
01:49:44.280 --> 01:49:44.671
<v Speaker 2>It was a,</v>

3959
01:49:44.671 --> 01:49:46.860
<v Speaker 2>it was like a total psychedelic experience.</v>

3960
01:49:46.861 --> 01:49:48.160
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I took too much</v>

3961
01:49:48.160 --> 01:49:48.910
<v Speaker 4>or what,</v>

3962
01:49:48.910 --> 01:49:53.800
<v Speaker 4>but I remember the seven maybe [inaudible] 98,</v>

3963
01:49:53.980 --> 01:49:56.440
<v Speaker 4>somewhere in the nineties when it was still available.</v>

3964
01:49:56.560 --> 01:50:00.020
<v Speaker 4>I know do it a stand up comedian that's addicted to this stuff and he used to</v>

3965
01:50:00.280 --> 01:50:01.230
<v Speaker 4>work in clubs.</v>

3966
01:50:01.231 --> 01:50:04.720
<v Speaker 4>It's like in the eighties and nineties and the club owner would have to go out,</v>

3967
01:50:04.721 --> 01:50:06.370
<v Speaker 4>like send a manager out to pick them up,</v>

3968
01:50:06.371 --> 01:50:08.740
<v Speaker 4>nyquil bottles of Nyquil,</v>

3969
01:50:09.190 --> 01:50:11.590
<v Speaker 4>and then he would go back to his hotel room and get fucked up.</v>

3970
01:50:12.420 --> 01:50:12.970
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3971
01:50:12.970 --> 01:50:15.040

01:51:05.950 --> 01:51:08.530
<v Speaker 4>it's a James Franco.</v>

01:51:08.860 --> 01:51:10.900
<v Speaker 4>James Franco and Kanye western music.</v>

4012
01:51:11.560 --> 01:51:11.760
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

01:51:11.760 --> 01:51:11.881
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

01:51:12.011 --> 01:51:12.280
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

4016
01:51:12.280 --> 01:51:13.770
<v Speaker 2>The one on one.</v>

4017
01:51:13.890 --> 01:51:15.580
<v Speaker 2>One on the right is a parody.</v>

4018
01:51:15.581 --> 01:51:16.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4019
01:51:16.270 --> 01:51:19.150
<v Speaker 2>Because it was such a ridiculous video that Connie is like pretty much having</v>

4020
01:51:19.151 --> 01:51:19.960
<v Speaker 2>sex with,</v>

4024
01:51:28.290 --> 01:51:29.290
<v Speaker 2>So bad though.</v>

4029
01:51:38.760 --> 01:51:41.320
<v Speaker 2>overinflated ego nonsense.</v>

4030
01:51:42.310 --> 01:51:43.180
<v Speaker 2>Did you see him on.</v>

4031
01:51:43.280 --> 01:51:44.680
<v Speaker 2>They brought it back on South Park.</v>

4032
01:51:44.681 --> 01:51:47.650
<v Speaker 2>I'm the last one was the gay fish one and they brought him back this time.</v>

4033
01:51:47.760 --> 01:51:49.130
<v Speaker 2>A hobby?</v>

4034
01:51:49.380 --> 01:51:49.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4035
01:51:49.910 --> 01:51:50.860
<v Speaker 2>as Kardashians.</v>

4036
01:51:50.890 --> 01:51:51.680
<v Speaker 2>The hobbit.</v>

<v Speaker 2>am I crazy or did Connie?</v>

4043
01:51:55.960 --> 01:51:57.470
<v Speaker 2>She used to be a rational human being.</v>

4044
01:51:57.471 --> 01:52:00.730
<v Speaker 2>Like he just wasn't famous enough for them to really bloom.</v>

4045
01:52:01.050 --> 01:52:02.260
<v Speaker 2>Shot this terrible piece of shit.</v>

4046
01:52:02.500 --> 01:52:03.270
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty funny.</v>

4047
01:52:03.270 --> 01:52:04.150
<v Speaker 2>They start making out.</v>

4048
01:52:04.410 --> 01:52:06.350
<v Speaker 2>It's not good enough to just to have enough.</v>

4049
01:52:07.040 --> 01:52:09.400
<v Speaker 2>It's not good enough to stop it.</v>

4050
01:52:09.401 --> 01:52:10.234
<v Speaker 2>Shut it off.</v>

4051
01:52:10.670 --> 01:52:11.503
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

4052
01:52:11.710 --> 01:52:13.900
<v Speaker 4>I get it guys.</v>

4053
01:52:13.970 --> 01:52:14.800
<v Speaker 4>Just so bad.</v>

4054
01:52:14.800 --> 01:52:15.633
<v Speaker 4>I don't get it.</v>

4055
01:52:15.810 --> 01:52:17.260
<v Speaker 4>It'd be someone tried to explain to me the,</v>

4056
01:52:17.340 --> 01:52:17.421
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

4057
01:52:17.421 --> 01:52:18.580
<v Speaker 4>this is another thing that's really cute.</v>

4058
01:52:18.760 --> 01:52:20.980
<v Speaker 4>I'm liberals really left wing.</v>

4059
01:52:20.981 --> 01:52:23.620
<v Speaker 4>People have taken to defending Kanye,</v>

4060
01:52:23.621 --> 01:52:24.790
<v Speaker 4>saying that he's a genius.</v>

4061
01:52:25.060 --> 01:52:27.400
<v Speaker 4>The white guilt comes out in full blast.</v>

4062
01:52:27.401 --> 01:52:28.030
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

4063
01:52:28.030 --> 01:52:28.750
<v Speaker 4>I've read.</v>

4064
01:52:28.750 --> 01:52:29.860
<v Speaker 4>Actually I've read.</v>

4065
01:52:29.920 --> 01:52:30.550
<v Speaker 4>So they,</v>

4066
01:52:30.550 --> 01:52:32.980
<v Speaker 4>they loved him for that moment where he said,</v>

4067
01:52:32.981 --> 01:52:34.900
<v Speaker 4>Bush hates black people after Katrina.</v>

4068
01:52:35.080 --> 01:52:35.261
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

4069
01:52:35.261 --> 01:52:36.670
<v Speaker 4>if you want some street cred,</v>

4070
01:52:36.940 --> 01:52:37.271
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4071
01:52:37.271 --> 01:52:37.720
<v Speaker 4>you uh,</v>

4072
01:52:37.720 --> 01:52:40.870
<v Speaker 4>you talk about how Kanye west is a genius.</v>

4073
01:52:40.930 --> 01:52:42.160
<v Speaker 4>He's a misunderstood genius.</v>

4074
01:52:42.161 --> 01:52:43.160
<v Speaker 4>And like all genie sissies.</v>

4075
01:52:43.830 --> 01:52:44.311
<v Speaker 2>What do you,</v>

4076
01:52:44.311 --> 01:52:45.380
<v Speaker 2>he misunderstood genius.</v>

4077
01:52:45.381 --> 01:52:46.430
<v Speaker 2>How many records you sell?</v>

4078
01:52:46.431 --> 01:52:46.700
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

4079
01:52:46.700 --> 01:52:48.400
<v Speaker 2>he's an understood genius apparently.</v>

4080
01:52:48.401 --> 01:52:48.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4081
01:52:48.960 --> 01:52:49.791
<v Speaker 6>Well understood.</v>

4082
01:52:49.791 --> 01:52:50.820
<v Speaker 6>And the fact he's criticized.</v>

4083
01:52:51.110 --> 01:52:52.880
<v Speaker 6>The reason why he says such things,</v>

4084
01:52:52.881 --> 01:52:53.840
<v Speaker 6>it's because he's a genius.</v>

4085
01:52:54.270 --> 01:52:55.400
<v Speaker 6>Geniuses are unhinged.</v>

4086
01:52:55.760 --> 01:52:57.950
<v Speaker 6>But the problem is the music's terrible.</v>

4087
01:52:58.010 --> 01:52:59.300
<v Speaker 6>So that evidence doesn't hold up.</v>

4088
01:52:59.630 --> 01:53:00.740
<v Speaker 6>Why is it sell so much?</v>

4089
01:53:01.040 --> 01:53:04.310
<v Speaker 6>The same reason why the recent Gallup poll said the 46 percent of the people</v>

4090
01:53:04.311 --> 01:53:06.110
<v Speaker 6>thought the earth is less than 10,000 years old.</v>

4091
01:53:06.290 --> 01:53:06.890
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

4092
01:53:06.890 --> 01:53:08.410
<v Speaker 6>We're overwhelmed by retards.</v>

4093
01:53:08.560 --> 01:53:08.810
<v Speaker 6>We're,</v>

4094
01:53:08.810 --> 01:53:09.700
<v Speaker 6>we're swimming up.</v>

4095
01:53:09.710 --> 01:53:09.980
<v Speaker 6>Yup.</v>

4096
01:53:09.980 --> 01:53:10.640
<v Speaker 2>And whatever.</v>

4097
01:53:10.640 --> 01:53:12.200
<v Speaker 2>Whatever shit is put on the radio,</v>

4098
01:53:12.201 --> 01:53:13.850
<v Speaker 2>the most will sell the most.</v>

4099
01:53:13.880 --> 01:53:15.890
<v Speaker 2>So whatever record companies with,</v>

4100
01:53:16.070 --> 01:53:18.620
<v Speaker 2>it's getting to put it on the radio every 10 seconds.</v>

4101
01:53:18.830 --> 01:53:19.431
<v Speaker 6>Not only that,</v>

4102
01:53:19.431 --> 01:53:22.700
<v Speaker 6>now that he's locked up with Kim Kardashian and he's involved in this fucking</v>

4103
01:53:22.701 --> 01:53:23.800
<v Speaker 6>weird sort of a,</v>

4104
01:53:24.120 --> 01:53:24.471
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4105
01:53:24.471 --> 01:53:25.640
<v Speaker 6>a reality.</v>

4106
01:53:26.070 --> 01:53:26.231
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4107
01:53:26.231 --> 01:53:27.890
<v Speaker 2>It's like a metal reality.</v>

4108
01:53:28.010 --> 01:53:28.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4109
01:53:28.270 --> 01:53:28.731
<v Speaker 6>It's this,</v>

4110
01:53:28.731 --> 01:53:29.010
<v Speaker 6>this,</v>

4111
01:53:29.010 --> 01:53:29.680
<v Speaker 6>this,</v>

4112
01:53:29.680 --> 01:53:34.210
<v Speaker 6>this weird meme at this internet thing where everybody's talking about and it's</v>

4113
01:53:34.211 --> 01:53:35.290
<v Speaker 6>constantly keeps up.</v>

4114
01:53:35.590 --> 01:53:35.840
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4115
01:53:35.840 --> 01:53:38.450

<v Speaker 1>and we're being.</v>

4261
01:57:00.360 --> 01:57:00.500
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

4262
01:57:00.500 --> 01:57:03.250
<v Speaker 7>I know back then it used to be cute for it didn't matter if it was a boy or</v>

4263
01:57:03.260 --> 01:57:03.441
<v Speaker 7>girl.</v>

4264
01:57:03.441 --> 01:57:05.530
<v Speaker 7>You dressed them up in a dress because it was cute because our babies.</v>

4265
01:57:05.580 --> 01:57:06.950
<v Speaker 7>I don't know about that man.</v>

4266
01:57:10.640 --> 01:57:11.420
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

4267
01:57:11.420 --> 01:57:12.253
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

4268
01:57:12.470 --> 01:57:13.340
<v Speaker 1>You can't debunk it.</v>

4269
01:57:13.400 --> 01:57:15.050
<v Speaker 1>FDR dropping address.</v>

4270
01:57:15.620 --> 01:57:16.100
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

4271
01:57:16.100 --> 01:57:19.700
<v Speaker 1>This is the article that I tweeted from the Atlantic and said it was wasn't</v>

4272
01:57:19.701 --> 01:57:21.920
<v Speaker 1>always blue for boys and pink for girls.</v>

4273
01:57:22.330 --> 01:57:23.690
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking really strange.</v>

4274
01:57:23.960 --> 01:57:24.651
<v Speaker 1>You don't think about it,</v>

4275
01:57:24.651 --> 01:57:25.400
<v Speaker 1>but that was.</v>

4276
01:57:25.400 --> 01:57:27.290
<v Speaker 1>That was like not that long ago</v>

4277
01:57:28.900 --> 01:57:32.860
<v Speaker 1>and people apparently on a regular basis just to kids up like the crest jesser</v>

4278
01:57:33.070 --> 01:57:34.900
<v Speaker 1>boys up like girls and nobody thought anything of it.</v>

4279
01:57:37.190 --> 01:57:38.300
<v Speaker 1>The new deals mastermind.</v>

4280
01:57:38.301 --> 01:57:41.450
<v Speaker 1>Unexpected childhood look as a reminder that our culture norms about gender</v>

4281
01:57:41.451 --> 01:57:44.390
<v Speaker 1>specific clothing for children are surprisingly recent.</v>

4282
01:57:44.690 --> 01:57:46.820
<v Speaker 1>Historically historical development,</v>

4283
01:57:47.100 --> 01:57:47.933
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

4284
01:57:48.350 --> 01:57:49.220
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of weird.</v>

4285
01:57:49.250 --> 01:57:49.790
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4286
01:57:49.790 --> 01:57:53.100
<v Speaker 1>it is weird that we decide like the ladies on Fox News are allowed to wear these</v>

4287
01:57:53.110 --> 01:57:55.880
<v Speaker 1>skirts and loud to have these legs exposed,</v>

4288
01:57:55.900 --> 01:57:56.690
<v Speaker 1>but men are not.</v>

4289
01:57:56.690 --> 01:57:58.610
<v Speaker 1>We have to wear our silly close,</v>

4290
01:57:58.700 --> 01:58:01.970
<v Speaker 1>but if we were in Africa were Maasai Warriors,</v>

4291
01:58:01.990 --> 01:58:02.960
<v Speaker 1>we'd have to dress differently.</v>

4292
01:58:03.170 --> 01:58:03.950
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4293
01:58:03.950 --> 01:58:07.460
<v Speaker 1>we just accept the societal paradigm.</v>

4294
01:58:07.670 --> 01:58:08.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4295
01:58:08.480 --> 01:58:09.650
<v Speaker 1>we accept some weird shit.</v>

4296
01:58:10.130 --> 01:58:11.270
<v Speaker 1>Why can't FDR being addressed?</v>

4297
01:58:11.271 --> 01:58:12.104
<v Speaker 1>Brian?</v>

4298
01:58:12.830 --> 01:58:13.663
<v Speaker 1>I think it's cute.</v>

4299
01:58:13.930 --> 01:58:14.380
<v Speaker 1>He does.</v>

4300
01:58:14.380 --> 01:58:15.213
<v Speaker 1>It's very cute.</v>

4301
01:58:15.260 --> 01:58:17.890
<v Speaker 7>I think I was trying to find more pictures of it because uh,</v>

4302
01:58:17.940 --> 01:58:22.190
<v Speaker 7>actually I think my mom told me that a long time ago and I didn't believe her.</v>

4303
01:58:22.191 --> 01:58:25.940
<v Speaker 7>And then I found out that there's like a lot of old pictures and paintings and</v>

4304
01:58:25.941 --> 01:58:28.550
<v Speaker 7>boys in dresses and I started collecting them.</v>

4305
01:58:28.610 --> 01:58:29.630
<v Speaker 7>How do you know it's a boy though?</v>

4306
01:58:30.940 --> 01:58:33.190
<v Speaker 1>Could just be really looking at this one.</v>

4307
01:58:33.280 --> 01:58:35.640
<v Speaker 1>I know boys in dresses.</v>

4308
01:58:37.140 --> 01:58:37.420
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4309
01:58:37.420 --> 01:58:38.171
<v Speaker 1>are you looking at your phone?</v>

4310
01:58:38.171 --> 01:58:39.004
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

4311
01:58:39.160 --> 01:58:40.020
<v Speaker 1>we can check it out of this.</v>

4312
01:58:40.350 --> 01:58:40.690
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4313
01:58:40.690 --> 01:58:41.150
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

4314
01:58:41.150 --> 01:58:42.250
<v Speaker 1>I was looking at tweets</v>

4315
01:58:42.250 --> 01:58:43.083
<v Speaker 2>about the show.</v>

4316
01:58:43.300 --> 01:58:44.133
<v Speaker 2>You can't do that.</v>

4317
01:58:44.420 --> 01:58:44.930
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

4318
01:58:44.930 --> 01:58:45.850
<v Speaker 2>Do it while it's happening.</v>

4319
01:58:45.851 --> 01:58:47.120
<v Speaker 2>They'll suck you in our religion.</v>

4320
01:58:47.140 --> 01:58:47.840
<v Speaker 2>You'll never escape.</v>

4321
01:58:47.840 --> 01:58:48.610
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

4322
01:58:48.610 --> 01:58:49.360
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know that rule.</v>

4323
01:58:49.360 --> 01:58:51.460
<v Speaker 2>And then they'll ask you questions and then you respond to,</v>

4324
01:58:51.461 --> 01:58:52.510
<v Speaker 2>you guys all got your computers.</v>

4325
01:58:52.511 --> 01:58:53.344
<v Speaker 2>I feel left out.</v>

4326
01:58:53.440 --> 01:58:53.620
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4327
01:58:53.620 --> 01:58:56.750
<v Speaker 2>it's just because we were given each tried to talk about that's how we met</v>

4328
01:58:57.130 --> 01:58:58.980
<v Speaker 2>because there's certain things that are going on in the news</v>

4329
01:58:59.140 --> 01:59:00.010
<v Speaker 1>thought were fascinating.</v>

4330
01:59:00.020 --> 01:59:02.650
<v Speaker 1>I knew I was going to bring up so I had to.</v>

4331
01:59:02.651 --> 01:59:03.484
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4332
01:59:03.870 --> 01:59:04.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

4333
01:59:04.600 --> 01:59:06.430
<v Speaker 1>one of the things I wanted to talk about was,</v>

4334
01:59:06.431 --> 01:59:06.970
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4335
01:59:06.970 --> 01:59:07.211
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

4336
01:59:07.211 --> 01:59:12.040
<v Speaker 1>the FDA is actually saying now the antibacterial soaps may not curve bacteria.</v>

4337
01:59:12.490 --> 01:59:15.550
<v Speaker 1>They're also saying that like washing your hands in hot water doesn't do a</v>

4338
01:59:15.551 --> 01:59:17.400
<v Speaker 1>goddamn thing and that it's just,</v>

4339
01:59:17.410 --> 01:59:22.180
<v Speaker 1>it's soap that kills bacteria and that antibacterial soap is actually bad for</v>

4340
01:59:22.181 --> 01:59:22.960
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

4341
01:59:22.960 --> 01:59:23.510
<v Speaker 1>And.</v>

4342
01:59:23.510 --> 01:59:25.640
<v Speaker 1>But the Purell Shit</v>

4343
01:59:25.640 --> 01:59:27.520
<v Speaker 2>does kill like all the bags.</v>

4344
01:59:27.530 --> 01:59:28.940
<v Speaker 2>That's not antibacterial soap.</v>

4345
01:59:28.990 --> 01:59:29.211
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

4346
01:59:29.211 --> 01:59:29.451
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

4347
01:59:29.451 --> 01:59:30.380
<v Speaker 2>That's just poisoned.</v>

4348
01:59:30.410 --> 01:59:30.770
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

4349
01:59:30.770 --> 01:59:31.310
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

4350
01:59:31.310 --> 01:59:34.130
<v Speaker 2>But it's also making it so that we don't have any defense mechanisms anymore.</v>

4351
01:59:34.460 --> 01:59:34.731
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4352
01:59:34.731 --> 01:59:37.700
<v Speaker 2>it is on your hands if you're one of those Howie Mendell type dudes,</v>

4353
01:59:38.020 --> 01:59:39.090
<v Speaker 2>that shit in your hand every day.</v>

4354
01:59:39.110 --> 01:59:39.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4355
01:59:39.380 --> 01:59:40.310
<v Speaker 2>Some people do that.</v>

4356
01:59:40.311 --> 01:59:41.420
<v Speaker 2>They get obsessed with it.</v>

4357
01:59:41.770 --> 01:59:43.400
<v Speaker 2>Being blue should shut that heater off man,</v>

4358
01:59:43.401 --> 01:59:43.910
<v Speaker 2>because it's,</v>

4359
01:59:43.910 --> 01:59:45.990
<v Speaker 2>it's about 150,000 fucking degrees in here.</v>

4360
01:59:48.200 --> 01:59:49.033
<v Speaker 2>It's great.</v>

4361
01:59:49.860 --> 01:59:50.850
<v Speaker 1>Soon we'll have really.</v>

4362
01:59:52.080 --> 01:59:52.913
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4363
01:59:54.230 --> 01:59:54.800
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

4364
01:59:54.800 --> 01:59:57.740
<v Speaker 2>what they're saying is that we were using it way too much and that,</v>

4365
01:59:57.741 --> 01:59:57.920
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4366
01:59:57.920 --> 02:00:01.430
<v Speaker 2>people that are doing that or they're killing their natural skin flora and uh,</v>

4367
02:00:01.530 --> 02:00:02.010
<v Speaker 2>that it's,</v>

4368
02:00:02.010 --> 02:00:03.920
<v Speaker 2>it's not preventing us from getting sick.</v>

4369
02:00:04.170 --> 02:00:09.170
<v Speaker 2>We're gonna run into some like bat anti biotic resistant strain of something</v>

4370
02:00:10.161 --> 02:00:14.100
<v Speaker 2>soon that's gonna fucking tear us up because apparently it's,</v>

4371
02:00:14.101 --> 02:00:15.590
<v Speaker 2>it's caused by like factory farms.</v>

4372
02:00:15.591 --> 02:00:18.680
<v Speaker 2>They pumped those animals full of shit so they can live like on top of each</v>

4373
02:00:18.681 --> 02:00:22.520
<v Speaker 2>other and something vicious is gonna come up soon.</v>

4374
02:00:22.790 --> 02:00:23.421
<v Speaker 2>Most likely,</v>

4375
02:00:23.421 --> 02:00:23.781
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4376
02:00:23.781 --> 02:00:25.730
<v Speaker 2>If we keep fucking around with the ecosystem,</v>

4377
02:00:25.731 --> 02:00:27.030
<v Speaker 2>it bounces back like,</v>

4378
02:00:27.040 --> 02:00:27.230
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

4379
02:00:27.230 --> 02:00:28.370
<v Speaker 2>all these dead bees,</v>

4380
02:00:28.371 --> 02:00:28.840
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

4381
02:00:28.840 --> 02:00:29.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4382
02:00:29.210 --> 02:00:30.410
<v Speaker 2>That's a weird thing man.</v>

4383
02:00:30.411 --> 02:00:31.750
<v Speaker 2>That the amount of oil that's,</v>

4384
02:00:31.820 --> 02:00:36.260
<v Speaker 2>that's probably the GMO crops where they think that they think that that has</v>

4385
02:00:36.261 --> 02:00:37.330
<v Speaker 2>something to do is actually an artist.</v>

4386
02:00:37.340 --> 02:00:37.750
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>

4387
02:00:37.750 --> 02:00:38.583
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4388
02:00:38.650 --> 02:00:39.230
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4389
02:00:39.230 --> 02:00:44.230
<v Speaker 1>from my twitter feed the other day from a Seattle organic restaurants.com,</v>

4390
02:00:45.650 --> 02:00:50.650
<v Speaker 1>whereas just talking about the pesticides manufactured by Bayer and Syngenta,</v>

4391
02:00:50.870 --> 02:00:52.920
<v Speaker 1>94 percent of GMO corn in the u.</v>

4392
02:00:52.921 --> 02:00:56.630
<v Speaker 1>s is treated with either while we listen to this word,</v>

4393
02:00:56.930 --> 02:00:57.510
<v Speaker 1>Imo,</v>

4394
02:00:57.510 --> 02:00:58.020
<v Speaker 1>Dac,</v>

4395
02:00:58.020 --> 02:01:02.770
<v Speaker 1>glow printed or clothing and it didn't.</v>

4396
02:01:02.960 --> 02:01:03.171
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

4397
02:01:03.171 --> 02:01:04.580
<v Speaker 2>I love that stuff on my pasta.</v>

4398
02:01:04.610 --> 02:01:05.840
<v Speaker 2>That sounds good for your corn.</v>

4399
02:01:06.440 --> 02:01:07.460
<v Speaker 2>Corn Tastes Yummy.</v>

4400
02:01:07.970 --> 02:01:11.000
<v Speaker 2>This guy did this thing where we put a square box and he counted all the</v>

4401
02:01:11.001 --> 02:01:14.900
<v Speaker 2>biodiversity inside of it for like 24 hours in different parts of the world and</v>

4402
02:01:14.960 --> 02:01:15.590
<v Speaker 2>there's tons of,</v>

4403
02:01:15.590 --> 02:01:16.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4404
02:01:16.080 --> 02:01:18.560
<v Speaker 2>24 hours you find all kinds of insects and all kinds of shit.</v>

4405
02:01:18.561 --> 02:01:19.370
<v Speaker 2>Flowers and anything.</v>

4406
02:01:19.370 --> 02:01:23.330
<v Speaker 2>You put it in a cornfield in Iowa or whatever and like over 24 hours he found</v>

4407
02:01:23.331 --> 02:01:25.820
<v Speaker 2>like three insects or something because it kills everything.</v>

4408
02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:26.810
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

4409
02:01:26.810 --> 02:01:26.991
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4410
02:01:26.991 --> 02:01:28.820
<v Speaker 2>That's the way you can grow that corn and nobody eats it.</v>

4411
02:01:29.140 --> 02:01:32.030
<v Speaker 2>You gotta just jacket full of all kinds of wacky stuff.</v>

4412
02:01:32.060 --> 02:01:32.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4413
02:01:32.330 --> 02:01:36.040
<v Speaker 2>They say that also cell phone signals or messing around with bugs that it's a</v>

4414
02:01:36.360 --> 02:01:36.830
<v Speaker 2>beat.</v>

4415
02:01:36.830 --> 02:01:40.040
<v Speaker 2>A bees communicate with a some sort of</v>

4416
02:01:40.190 --> 02:01:44.120
<v Speaker 6>a frequency that gets interfered with by cell phones.</v>

4417
02:01:44.150 --> 02:01:45.230
<v Speaker 6>They can pick up on that.</v>

4418
02:01:45.231 --> 02:01:46.910
<v Speaker 6>So when they're flying around,</v>

4419
02:01:46.940 --> 02:01:49.040
<v Speaker 6>they hear the transmissions,</v>

4420
02:01:49.070 --> 02:01:49.903
<v Speaker 6>they feel them,</v>

4421
02:01:50.210 --> 02:01:50.971
<v Speaker 6>and then it diverse.</v>

4422
02:01:50.971 --> 02:01:54.510
<v Speaker 6>So now bees are listed in our phone calls to grow.</v>

4423
02:01:54.640 --> 02:01:55.480
<v Speaker 6>God dammit.</v>

4424
02:01:55.620 --> 02:01:56.960
<v Speaker 6>So bees looking at cocktail</v>

4425
02:01:58.520 --> 02:01:59.840
<v Speaker 6>appease affected myself.</v>

4426
02:01:59.850 --> 02:02:04.850
<v Speaker 6>Am I on top of their head also while they have those multiple facet eyes?</v>

4427
02:02:05.170 --> 02:02:06.003
<v Speaker 6>It's a lot of eyes.</v>

4428
02:02:06.080 --> 02:02:06.350
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

4429
02:02:06.350 --> 02:02:08.150
<v Speaker 6>They have eyes that are like,</v>

4430
02:02:08.360 --> 02:02:11.270
<v Speaker 6>like pull up a bi because they're pretty trippy when you see them in real life.</v>

4431
02:02:13.280 --> 02:02:13.581
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

4432
02:02:13.581 --> 02:02:14.414
<v Speaker 6>There's a.</v>

4433
02:02:14.680 --> 02:02:15.201
<v Speaker 6>That was uh,</v>

4434
02:02:15.201 --> 02:02:19.350
<v Speaker 6>that was a concern a few years ago that was started.</v>

4435
02:02:19.410 --> 02:02:20.121
<v Speaker 6>They were starting to.</v>

4436
02:02:20.121 --> 02:02:25.121
<v Speaker 6>I'm trying to figure out what was causing the bees to a drop off and they</v>

4437
02:02:25.581 --> 02:02:26.510
<v Speaker 6>thought it was killing him,</v>

4438
02:02:26.511 --> 02:02:27.860
<v Speaker 6>but they say they're not killing them.</v>

4439
02:02:28.180 --> 02:02:30.380
<v Speaker 6>They're pretty sure that cell phones aren't killing bees,</v>

4440
02:02:30.620 --> 02:02:33.380
<v Speaker 6>but they're definitely disturbing them and they're definitely,</v>

4441
02:02:33.381 --> 02:02:37.520
<v Speaker 6>I'm fucking with their ability to communicate and people don't realize that when</v>

4442
02:02:37.521 --> 02:02:38.330
<v Speaker 6>the bees are gone,</v>

4443
02:02:38.330 --> 02:02:40.010
<v Speaker 6>we're in a lot of trouble.</v>

4444
02:02:40.070 --> 02:02:40.371
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

4445
02:02:40.371 --> 02:02:43.610
<v Speaker 6>Have you seen those crazy little artificial bees at Monsanto's created?</v>

4446
02:02:43.910 --> 02:02:44.540
<v Speaker 6>I heard about him.</v>

4447
02:02:44.540 --> 02:02:44.870
<v Speaker 6>I didn't.</v>

4448
02:02:44.870 --> 02:02:45.703
<v Speaker 6>I didn't say anything.</v>

4449
02:02:46.100 --> 02:02:47.600
<v Speaker 6>Just as weird as the drone thing.</v>

4450
02:02:47.960 --> 02:02:48.740
<v Speaker 6>Tiny drones.</v>

4451
02:02:48.740 --> 02:02:49.640
<v Speaker 6>The drone bees.</v>

4452
02:02:50.030 --> 02:02:52.300
<v Speaker 6>The idea is create something that can do the work of a bee.</v>

4453
02:02:52.620 --> 02:02:52.850
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

4454
02:02:52.850 --> 02:02:56.120
<v Speaker 6>because apparently they'll rent beehives and you gotta like someone will bring</v>

4455
02:02:56.121 --> 02:02:57.920
<v Speaker 6>it out to like pollinate your shit.</v>

4456
02:02:58.230 --> 02:02:59.660
<v Speaker 6>That dragon fly eyes.</v>

4457
02:02:59.930 --> 02:03:03.330
<v Speaker 6>See these are probably from the future and this whole time these are like just a</v>

4458
02:03:03.340 --> 02:03:04.670
<v Speaker 6>little drones recording us.</v>

4459
02:03:06.490 --> 02:03:07.323
<v Speaker 6>Hologram.</v>

4460
02:03:08.850 --> 02:03:09.080
<v Speaker 6>See?</v>

4461
02:03:09.080 --> 02:03:09.411
<v Speaker 6>Would it be.</v>

4462
02:03:09.411 --> 02:03:10.760
<v Speaker 6>I was a hologram world.</v>

4463
02:03:11.810 --> 02:03:12.040
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

4464
02:03:12.040 --> 02:03:13.190
<v Speaker 6>They're so fucking strange.</v>

4465
02:03:13.830 --> 02:03:17.480
<v Speaker 6>I mean we're just looking at them as if they're normal because we see them</v>

4466
02:03:17.481 --> 02:03:18.980
<v Speaker 6>everyday and they are part of our life,</v>

4467
02:03:18.981 --> 02:03:21.410
<v Speaker 6>but if we didn't know about bees,</v>

4468
02:03:21.440 --> 02:03:22.131
<v Speaker 6>they didn't exist.</v>

4469
02:03:22.131 --> 02:03:23.600
<v Speaker 6>Then all of a sudden there was bees everywhere.</v>

4470
02:03:23.630 --> 02:03:24.081
<v Speaker 6>We'd be like,</v>

4471
02:03:24.081 --> 02:03:24.950
<v Speaker 6>what the fuck?</v>

4472
02:03:25.280 --> 02:03:26.113
<v Speaker 6>Those things.</v>

4473
02:03:26.540 --> 02:03:29.900
<v Speaker 6>It's weird little things that can sting you and fuck you up and if you're one of</v>

4474
02:03:29.901 --> 02:03:31.910
<v Speaker 6>those poor people that's allergic to bee stings,</v>

4475
02:03:32.630 --> 02:03:33.650
<v Speaker 6>that must be terrifying.</v>

4476
02:03:33.870 --> 02:03:36.080
<v Speaker 6>Go into a field and everywhere you go you could die.</v>

4477
02:03:36.290 --> 02:03:38.230
<v Speaker 6>You know you can get stung by some country,</v>

4478
02:03:38.240 --> 02:03:39.073
<v Speaker 6>little bug.</v>

4479
02:03:39.110 --> 02:03:40.460
<v Speaker 6>It literally shuts your heart down.</v>

4480
02:03:40.550 --> 02:03:42.920
<v Speaker 6>There's something beautifully ironic about the fact that a lot of us can't</v>

4481
02:03:42.921 --> 02:03:44.150
<v Speaker 6>survive in a field anymore.</v>

4482
02:03:44.390 --> 02:03:45.223
<v Speaker 6>It's true.</v>

4483
02:03:45.650 --> 02:03:49.070
<v Speaker 6>Kenny peanut butter cancer having to field can't smoke weed.</v>

4484
02:03:52.120 --> 02:03:53.300
<v Speaker 6>Oh Wow.</v>

4485
02:03:53.301 --> 02:03:54.140
<v Speaker 6>That's so strange.</v>

4486
02:03:54.420 --> 02:03:55.490
<v Speaker 6>It looks like technology.</v>

4487
02:03:55.491 --> 02:03:55.791
<v Speaker 6>It doesn't.</v>

4488
02:03:55.791 --> 02:03:56.151
<v Speaker 6>It doesn't.</v>

4489
02:03:56.151 --> 02:03:57.080
<v Speaker 6>That look like.</v>

4490
02:03:57.420 --> 02:03:57.580
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

4491
02:03:57.580 --> 02:04:00.110
<v Speaker 6>it also looks like it looks like it's fractal,</v>

4492
02:04:00.140 --> 02:04:00.501
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4493
02:04:00.501 --> 02:04:05.150
<v Speaker 6>like all those pine cones and you know when you see a sunflower seeds,</v>

4494
02:04:05.410 --> 02:04:07.470
<v Speaker 6>like sunflower seeds inside of it at all.</v>

4495
02:04:07.471 --> 02:04:08.560
<v Speaker 6>It looks fractal.</v>

4496
02:04:08.561 --> 02:04:08.841
<v Speaker 6>They all,</v>

4497
02:04:08.841 --> 02:04:09.674
<v Speaker 6>they all look like,</v>

4498
02:04:10.040 --> 02:04:10.231
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4499
02:04:10.231 --> 02:04:11.270
<v Speaker 6>like it's all.</v>

4500
02:04:11.271 --> 02:04:13.100
<v Speaker 6>I'm like a geometric pattern.</v>

4501
02:04:13.670 --> 02:04:15.020
<v Speaker 6>Million years of evolution.</v>

4502
02:04:15.290 --> 02:04:16.123
<v Speaker 6>So weird.</v>

4503
02:04:16.520 --> 02:04:18.470
<v Speaker 6>So weird that they developed eyes like,</v>

4504
02:04:19.380 --> 02:04:19.740
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4505
02:04:19.740 --> 02:04:23.960
<v Speaker 6>we developed eyes like this and then there's also shit that developed eyes like</v>

4506
02:04:24.020 --> 02:04:24.620
<v Speaker 6>us,</v>

4507
02:04:24.620 --> 02:04:29.300
<v Speaker 6>but completely outside of us like mollusks octopus.</v>

4508
02:04:29.450 --> 02:04:30.650
<v Speaker 6>Their eyes are very similar.</v>

4509
02:04:30.980 --> 02:04:35.450
<v Speaker 6>Squids and octopus octopus are incredibly smart to allegedly taken like</v>

4510
02:04:35.510 --> 02:04:37.440
<v Speaker 6>heightened shells and things to use tools and shit.</v>

4511
02:04:37.620 --> 02:04:39.230
<v Speaker 6>Too bad they are delicious.</v>

4512
02:04:39.770 --> 02:04:42.450
<v Speaker 6>They can also climb out of a fish tank,</v>

4513
02:04:42.451 --> 02:04:43.380
<v Speaker 6>walk across the floor,</v>

4514
02:04:43.410 --> 02:04:44.520
<v Speaker 6>climate to another fish tank,</v>

4515
02:04:44.550 --> 02:04:45.090
<v Speaker 6>eat the fish.</v>

4516
02:04:45.090 --> 02:04:46.250
<v Speaker 6>Then climbed back to the other fish.</v>

4517
02:04:47.010 --> 02:04:47.580
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

4518
02:04:47.580 --> 02:04:51.840
<v Speaker 6>It was a famous story about a guy who had these expensive fish is exotic fish in</v>

4519
02:04:51.841 --> 02:04:55.290
<v Speaker 6>the aquarium and one aquarium had octopus in it and one aquarium had these</v>

4520
02:04:55.291 --> 02:04:58.440
<v Speaker 6>really expensive fish and the fish would come up missing and the guy was like,</v>

4521
02:04:58.441 --> 02:04:59.370
<v Speaker 6>what the fuck is going on?</v>

4522
02:04:59.371 --> 02:05:00.330
<v Speaker 6>Like someone's stealing my fish.</v>

4523
02:05:00.570 --> 02:05:01.830
<v Speaker 6>So he set up a security camera.</v>

4524
02:05:02.010 --> 02:05:04.440
<v Speaker 6>It's like trying to figure out if someone snuck into his house and stole his</v>

4525
02:05:04.441 --> 02:05:06.270
<v Speaker 6>expensive fish because it kept happening.</v>

4526
02:05:07.380 --> 02:05:10.020
<v Speaker 6>So then he watched this octopus lift up the lid.</v>

4527
02:05:10.021 --> 02:05:10.800
<v Speaker 6>If it's aquarium,</v>

4528
02:05:10.800 --> 02:05:12.090
<v Speaker 6>climbed down the glass,</v>

4529
02:05:12.420 --> 02:05:13.950
<v Speaker 6>I guess they can hold their breath for a long time,</v>

4530
02:05:14.160 --> 02:05:15.240
<v Speaker 6>walk across the ground,</v>

4531
02:05:15.390 --> 02:05:16.590
<v Speaker 6>walk over to the other one,</v>

4532
02:05:16.591 --> 02:05:17.550
<v Speaker 6>climb inside of it,</v>

4533
02:05:18.110 --> 02:05:18.810
<v Speaker 6>the fish,</v>

4534
02:05:18.810 --> 02:05:20.190
<v Speaker 6>eat it and go back.</v>

4535
02:05:20.500 --> 02:05:20.891
<v Speaker 5>Tell me.</v>

4536
02:05:20.891 --> 02:05:21.810
<v Speaker 5>It was wearing a top hat.</v>

4537
02:05:23.550 --> 02:05:24.340
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4538
02:05:24.340 --> 02:05:24.680
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

4539
02:05:24.680 --> 02:05:25.151
<v Speaker 5>on the,</v>

4540
02:05:25.151 --> 02:05:27.250
<v Speaker 5>on the category of weird animal shit.</v>

4541
02:05:28.030 --> 02:05:30.670
<v Speaker 5>You should look up the chicken that lived for a year and a half without his</v>

4542
02:05:30.671 --> 02:05:31.330
<v Speaker 5>head.</v>

4543
02:05:31.330 --> 02:05:31.511
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

4544
02:05:31.511 --> 02:05:32.051
<v Speaker 5>I did see that.</v>

4545
02:05:32.051 --> 02:05:32.820
<v Speaker 5>Have you seen that?</v>

4546
02:05:32.820 --> 02:05:32.971
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

4547
02:05:32.971 --> 02:05:35.740
<v Speaker 5>they had a piece of it,</v>

4548
02:05:36.030 --> 02:05:37.240
<v Speaker 5>the just the brainstem.</v>

4549
02:05:37.690 --> 02:05:39.190
<v Speaker 5>So it was completely headless.</v>

4550
02:05:39.340 --> 02:05:42.250
<v Speaker 5>A year and a half and he took it to a university because everyone thought it was</v>

4551
02:05:42.251 --> 02:05:42.730
<v Speaker 5>a hoax.</v>

4552
02:05:42.730 --> 02:05:43.420
<v Speaker 5>How'd they eat?</v>

4553
02:05:43.420 --> 02:05:46.180
<v Speaker 5>How they had to rip shit into its neck.</v>

4554
02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:48.040
<v Speaker 5>Mountain goats are insane.</v>

4555
02:05:48.200 --> 02:05:49.270
<v Speaker 5>Look at Italy.</v>

4556
02:05:49.271 --> 02:05:51.940
<v Speaker 5>They're like super high up.</v>

4557
02:05:51.941 --> 02:05:54.940
<v Speaker 5>They're just climbing sideways off the Damn Damn.</v>

4558
02:05:55.130 --> 02:05:55.530
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4559
02:05:55.530 --> 02:05:56.310
<v Speaker 6>Mountain goats.</v>

4560
02:05:56.310 --> 02:05:59.580
<v Speaker 6>They have actually these really rough but flexible toes,</v>

4561
02:05:59.581 --> 02:06:00.230
<v Speaker 6>so they.</v>

4562
02:06:00.230 --> 02:06:02.830
<v Speaker 6>They grab a hold of rocks and they can get that.</v>

4563
02:06:02.910 --> 02:06:07.910
<v Speaker 6>They can walk on shit like easily that we could never walk on a spider.</v>

4564
02:06:08.530 --> 02:06:10.020
<v Speaker 6>Go Nature.</v>

4565
02:06:10.021 --> 02:06:11.340
<v Speaker 6>Use Crazy motherfucker.</v>

4566
02:06:11.341 --> 02:06:13.080
<v Speaker 6>You nature is weird.</v>

4567
02:06:13.380 --> 02:06:14.670
<v Speaker 6>It has a lot of options.</v>

4568
02:06:15.630 --> 02:06:16.590
<v Speaker 6>Figures out a way,</v>

4569
02:06:17.400 --> 02:06:21.810
<v Speaker 6>which is one of the more reprehensible things about our denial that these</v>

4570
02:06:21.811 --> 02:06:25.740
<v Speaker 6>dolphins and orcas are intelligent beings just because they're different than us</v>

4571
02:06:25.950 --> 02:06:27.720
<v Speaker 6>and that's why we get away with that kind of slavery</v>

4572
02:06:29.330 --> 02:06:30.163
<v Speaker 6>from</v>

4573
02:06:31.340 --> 02:06:32.550
<v Speaker 6>what led you to become.</v>

4574
02:06:32.551 --> 02:06:33.900
<v Speaker 6>To go from being like this,</v>

4575
02:06:33.930 --> 02:06:35.010
<v Speaker 6>besides that one.</v>

4576
02:06:35.011 --> 02:06:35.844
<v Speaker 6>Fox News appearance,</v>

4577
02:06:35.930 --> 02:06:39.960
<v Speaker 6>but to go from being this guy who's got an act and you know,</v>

4578
02:06:40.230 --> 02:06:42.840
<v Speaker 6>fairly digestible and then you go,</v>

4579
02:06:42.841 --> 02:06:43.400
<v Speaker 6>you know what?</v>

4580
02:06:43.400 --> 02:06:44.210
<v Speaker 6>I saw.</v>

4581
02:06:44.210 --> 02:06:45.150
<v Speaker 6>I got to say something.</v>

4582
02:06:45.151 --> 02:06:45.411
<v Speaker 6>All right,</v>

4583
02:06:45.411 --> 02:06:46.040
<v Speaker 6>this is.</v>

4584
02:06:46.040 --> 02:06:47.010
<v Speaker 6>We're dealing with,</v>

4585
02:06:47.310 --> 02:06:48.810
<v Speaker 6>I'm not satisfied with this anymore.</v>

4586
02:06:48.900 --> 02:06:49.261
<v Speaker 6>Like what?</v>

4587
02:06:49.261 --> 02:06:49.411
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

4588
02:06:49.411 --> 02:06:49.710
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>

4589
02:06:49.710 --> 02:06:50.050
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

4590
02:06:50.050 --> 02:06:50.461
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

4591
02:06:50.461 --> 02:06:52.950
<v Speaker 5>I think it started with the Iraq invasion,</v>

4592
02:06:53.510 --> 02:06:53.850
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4593
02:06:53.850 --> 02:06:57.930
<v Speaker 5>that kind of started to wake me up and then it just kept increasing and I woke</v>

4594
02:06:57.931 --> 02:06:59.150
<v Speaker 5>up more and more and you know,</v>

4595
02:06:59.250 --> 02:07:00.083
<v Speaker 5>reading,</v>

4596
02:07:00.330 --> 02:07:01.590
<v Speaker 5>reading a lot of great books,</v>

4597
02:07:01.620 --> 02:07:04.020
<v Speaker 5>Chomsky and hedges and Shit and uh,</v>

4598
02:07:04.330 --> 02:07:04.710
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4599
02:07:04.710 --> 02:07:05.200
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

4600
02:07:05.200 --> 02:07:05.680
<v Speaker 5>And it,</v>

4601
02:07:05.680 --> 02:07:08.040
<v Speaker 5>it infuriated me to the point where I was like,</v>

4602
02:07:08.041 --> 02:07:09.570
<v Speaker 5>I got to talk about this shit on stage.</v>

4603
02:07:09.890 --> 02:07:10.550
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>

4604
02:07:10.550 --> 02:07:10.970
<v Speaker 5>it was,</v>

4605
02:07:10.970 --> 02:07:11.500
<v Speaker 5>it was a lot,</v>

4606
02:07:11.500 --> 02:07:12.490
<v Speaker 5>a lot of anger and,</v>

4607
02:07:12.580 --> 02:07:13.230
<v Speaker 5>and uh,</v>

4608
02:07:13.230 --> 02:07:15.480
<v Speaker 5>how many years in what you doing comedy before he started doing that?</v>

4609
02:07:16.410 --> 02:07:17.243
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

4610
02:07:17.320 --> 02:07:20.880
<v Speaker 5>I mean it probably been like six or seven years,</v>

4611
02:07:20.881 --> 02:07:23.040
<v Speaker 5>but not all of those were full time,</v>

4612
02:07:23.070 --> 02:07:26.370
<v Speaker 5>so probably only like three full time and then,</v>

4613
02:07:26.790 --> 02:07:27.623
<v Speaker 5>but now it's,</v>

4614
02:07:27.720 --> 02:07:28.750
<v Speaker 5>it's been a bunch of years.</v>

4615
02:07:28.760 --> 02:07:30.900
<v Speaker 5>So we're just starting out in New York.</v>

4616
02:07:31.430 --> 02:07:31.920
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

4617
02:07:31.920 --> 02:07:33.030
<v Speaker 5>I started out in Richmond,</v>

4618
02:07:33.031 --> 02:07:33.511
<v Speaker 5>Virginia,</v>

4619
02:07:33.511 --> 02:07:35.600
<v Speaker 5>University of Virginia and uh,</v>

4620
02:07:35.660 --> 02:07:37.750
<v Speaker 5>then right after college moved to New York City.</v>

4621
02:07:37.970 --> 02:07:38.470
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4622
02:07:38.470 --> 02:07:40.030
<v Speaker 5>So you started doing standup in Richmond?</v>

4623
02:07:40.300 --> 02:07:40.970
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

4624
02:07:40.970 --> 02:07:42.640
<v Speaker 5>I open mics and uh,</v>

4625
02:07:42.650 --> 02:07:43.990
<v Speaker 5>and at Uva I would,</v>

4626
02:07:43.991 --> 02:07:44.330
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4627
02:07:44.330 --> 02:07:44.830
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4628
02:07:44.830 --> 02:07:48.610
<v Speaker 5>open for whatever fucking acts came through Darrell Hammond and Jimmy Fallon and</v>

4629
02:07:48.611 --> 02:07:48.980
<v Speaker 5>stuff.</v>

4630
02:07:48.980 --> 02:07:50.030
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>

4631
02:07:50.320 --> 02:07:52.560
<v Speaker 6>Was that terrifying that you probably went through?</v>

4632
02:07:52.610 --> 02:07:53.331
<v Speaker 6>That makes sense,</v>

4633
02:07:53.331 --> 02:07:53.980
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

4634
02:07:53.980 --> 02:07:54.311
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

4635
02:07:54.311 --> 02:07:54.610
<v Speaker 5>it was.</v>

4636
02:07:54.610 --> 02:07:54.791
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

4637
02:07:54.791 --> 02:07:56.680
<v Speaker 5>it was terrifying also because I was not like a,</v>

4638
02:07:56.830 --> 02:07:58.090
<v Speaker 5>I was not a performer.</v>

4639
02:07:58.091 --> 02:08:01.400
<v Speaker 5>I had never been on a stage in my life until I decided to do stand up and</v>

4640
02:08:03.120 --> 02:08:03.953
<v Speaker 6>wow,</v>

4641
02:08:04.020 --> 02:08:04.853
<v Speaker 6>that's wild.</v>

4642
02:08:05.010 --> 02:08:09.000
<v Speaker 6>So you do that for six or seven years and then the Iraq war comes around and you</v>

4643
02:08:09.001 --> 02:08:11.610
<v Speaker 6>decide to do the kind of actor you do it now where it's all like social</v>

4644
02:08:11.611 --> 02:08:12.530
<v Speaker 6>commentary and</v>

4645
02:08:12.770 --> 02:08:12.921
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

4646
02:08:12.921 --> 02:08:14.600
<v Speaker 5>it was a slow process because I feel like,</v>

4647
02:08:14.601 --> 02:08:14.801
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

4648
02:08:14.801 --> 02:08:15.020
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4649
02:08:15.020 --> 02:08:16.910
<v Speaker 5>you talk about that Shit and you know this well,</v>

4650
02:08:16.911 --> 02:08:19.050
<v Speaker 5>like you talked about the shit and you're going to alienate some of the crowds</v>

4651
02:08:19.051 --> 02:08:20.000
<v Speaker 5>to figuring out how to,</v>

4652
02:08:20.020 --> 02:08:22.100
<v Speaker 5>how to make them happy enough that they're not,</v>

4653
02:08:22.160 --> 02:08:23.750
<v Speaker 5>that you don't lose the crowd is it,</v>

4654
02:08:23.751 --> 02:08:23.990
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4655
02:08:23.990 --> 02:08:24.740
<v Speaker 5>it was a slow,</v>

4656
02:08:24.740 --> 02:08:28.700
<v Speaker 5>slow learning experience and it kind of moved over more and more and more until</v>

4657
02:08:28.701 --> 02:08:29.061
<v Speaker 5>now.</v>

4658
02:08:29.061 --> 02:08:30.910
<v Speaker 5>It's probably 90 percent about,</v>

4659
02:08:31.130 --> 02:08:32.320
<v Speaker 5>about world issues and shit.</v>

4660
02:08:32.760 --> 02:08:32.971
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

4661
02:08:32.971 --> 02:08:33.381
<v Speaker 6>World is,</v>

4662
02:08:33.381 --> 02:08:33.901
<v Speaker 6>she's mad.</v>

4663
02:08:33.901 --> 02:08:34.531
<v Speaker 6>God Damn you.</v>

4664
02:08:34.531 --> 02:08:36.090
<v Speaker 6>And especially if you're a woman,</v>

4665
02:08:36.300 --> 02:08:39.750
<v Speaker 6>if you're a woman and you're trying to have a political opinion on stage,</v>

4666
02:08:39.810 --> 02:08:40.621
<v Speaker 6>good luck.</v>

4667
02:08:40.621 --> 02:08:41.100
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

4668
02:08:41.100 --> 02:08:44.040
<v Speaker 6>There's so many shithead men that don't want to listen to a woman that has a</v>

4669
02:08:44.430 --> 02:08:45.450
<v Speaker 6>different opinion.</v>

4670
02:08:45.480 --> 02:08:45.730
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

4671
02:08:45.730 --> 02:08:46.150
<v Speaker 6>do</v>

4672
02:08:46.150 --> 02:08:46.511
<v Speaker 5>no doubt.</v>

4673
02:08:46.511 --> 02:08:47.740
<v Speaker 5>Because as it like,</v>

4674
02:08:47.741 --> 02:08:51.010
<v Speaker 5>there's a subconscious thing that goes on where the audience does like kind of</v>

4675
02:08:51.011 --> 02:08:53.950
<v Speaker 5>doesn't want to lower themselves by allowing the comedian to be funny.</v>

4676
02:08:53.951 --> 02:08:54.251
<v Speaker 5>And so,</v>

4677
02:08:54.251 --> 02:08:55.150
<v Speaker 5>especially with a woman,</v>

4678
02:08:55.151 --> 02:08:57.100
<v Speaker 5>you got dudes in the audience watching a woman,</v>

4679
02:08:57.340 --> 02:09:00.250
<v Speaker 5>they don't really want her to be funny because it's kind of lowing lowering</v>

4680
02:09:00.251 --> 02:09:01.210
<v Speaker 5>yourself and,</v>

4681
02:09:01.211 --> 02:09:01.331
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

4682
02:09:01.331 --> 02:09:06.250
<v Speaker 5>and so the way that that's easiest to achieve is I'm a slut or whatever,</v>

4683
02:09:06.251 --> 02:09:07.110
<v Speaker 5>and then they're,</v>

4684
02:09:07.120 --> 02:09:08.440
<v Speaker 5>the men in the audience are like,</v>

4685
02:09:08.441 --> 02:09:08.591
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

4686
02:09:08.591 --> 02:09:09.424
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

4687
02:09:09.900 --> 02:09:10.291
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

4688
02:09:10.291 --> 02:09:11.580
<v Speaker 6>that's like the best way.</v>

4689
02:09:12.630 --> 02:09:14.030
<v Speaker 6>If you don't go with the on the slot,</v>

4690
02:09:14.040 --> 02:09:16.260
<v Speaker 6>you better be hideous looking now.</v>

4691
02:09:16.400 --> 02:09:19.290
<v Speaker 6>You better be just some giant fucking frying pan faced,</v>

4692
02:09:19.770 --> 02:09:20.940
<v Speaker 6>nonsexual,</v>

4693
02:09:21.420 --> 02:09:21.910
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4694
02:09:21.910 --> 02:09:25.290
<v Speaker 6>I mean to be like a really attractive woman and be a stand up comedian boy,</v>

4695
02:09:25.291 --> 02:09:26.124
<v Speaker 6>a lot of.</v>

4696
02:09:26.400 --> 02:09:29.580
<v Speaker 6>I shouldn't generalize because there's people that break every mold,</v>

4697
02:09:30.440 --> 02:09:31.273
<v Speaker 6>but it's this,</v>

4698
02:09:31.380 --> 02:09:32.640
<v Speaker 6>it's a hard road that's hard.</v>

4699
02:09:33.030 --> 02:09:34.080
<v Speaker 6>That's a hard fucking road.</v>

4700
02:09:34.110 --> 02:09:34.980
<v Speaker 6>Certainly be done.</v>

4701
02:09:35.040 --> 02:09:35.840
<v Speaker 6>It's just difficult.</v>

4702
02:09:35.840 --> 02:09:37.140
<v Speaker 6>I always said there's like three,</v>

4703
02:09:37.150 --> 02:09:37.890
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

4704
02:09:37.890 --> 02:09:40.110
<v Speaker 6>three categories that uh,</v>

4705
02:09:40.111 --> 02:09:41.280
<v Speaker 6>your standup goes through.</v>

4706
02:09:41.460 --> 02:09:43.890
<v Speaker 6>Like in the beginning you're terrified to go on stage.</v>

4707
02:09:44.040 --> 02:09:45.210
<v Speaker 6>It's just their tools,</v>

4708
02:09:45.330 --> 02:09:47.010
<v Speaker 6>they just trying to get laughs at the beginning.</v>

4709
02:09:47.011 --> 02:09:48.750
<v Speaker 6>You might not like the joke at all,</v>

4710
02:09:48.870 --> 02:09:51.990
<v Speaker 6>but you think it works so you do it because you just trying to get a laugh and</v>

4711
02:09:51.991 --> 02:09:54.870
<v Speaker 6>then once you get a little bit comfortable then you start doing shit that you</v>

4712
02:09:54.871 --> 02:09:57.690
<v Speaker 6>think is funny shit that you actually would laugh at.</v>

4713
02:09:57.720 --> 02:09:58.920
<v Speaker 6>Like you'll laugh at your own jokes,</v>

4714
02:09:58.921 --> 02:09:59.970
<v Speaker 6>like this is actually pretty funny,</v>

4715
02:10:00.150 --> 02:10:03.720
<v Speaker 6>and then you realize what your own actual sense of humor is and you figure out a</v>

4716
02:10:03.721 --> 02:10:04.560
<v Speaker 6>way to express that.</v>

4717
02:10:05.010 --> 02:10:08.220
<v Speaker 6>Then and then some people never make this third step.</v>

4718
02:10:08.320 --> 02:10:11.400
<v Speaker 6>They don't have to like the greats like Hedberg Steven,</v>

4719
02:10:11.401 --> 02:10:11.641
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

4720
02:10:11.641 --> 02:10:14.430
<v Speaker 6>They never made this third step and there's still amongst the very best ever,</v>

4721
02:10:14.640 --> 02:10:15.210
<v Speaker 6>so it's not a.</v>

4722
02:10:15.210 --> 02:10:16.410
<v Speaker 6>it's not a mandatory step,</v>

4723
02:10:16.650 --> 02:10:18.710
<v Speaker 6>but for a lot of people that get to the position that you were in,</v>

4724
02:10:18.720 --> 02:10:19.230
<v Speaker 6>they always say,</v>

4725
02:10:19.230 --> 02:10:21.660
<v Speaker 6>I decide I want to make my opinions funny.</v>

4726
02:10:22.080 --> 02:10:26.760
<v Speaker 6>I want to figure out a way to make the ideas that I think</v>

4727
02:10:28.350 --> 02:10:33.120
<v Speaker 6>these ideas that are representative of how fucking silly we are as a society.</v>

4728
02:10:33.500 --> 02:10:34.070
<v Speaker 6>Turn them</v>

4729
02:10:34.070 --> 02:10:35.750
<v Speaker 4>into not just funny,</v>

4730
02:10:35.930 --> 02:10:38.840
<v Speaker 4>but something that makes you an eyeopening funny,</v>

4731
02:10:38.841 --> 02:10:41.870
<v Speaker 4>like you go back to work and you express it and then everybody laughs and go,</v>

4732
02:10:41.871 --> 02:10:42.704
<v Speaker 4>always fucking right.</v>

4733
02:10:43.170 --> 02:10:44.003
<v Speaker 4>That's funny.</v>

4734
02:10:44.930 --> 02:10:45.111
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4735
02:10:45.111 --> 02:10:47.670
<v Speaker 4>I think that third step also takes a full on.</v>

4736
02:10:47.671 --> 02:10:47.800
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4737
02:10:47.800 --> 02:10:51.490
<v Speaker 5>Confidence in what you're doing because you're going to alienate some people and</v>

4738
02:10:51.491 --> 02:10:51.971
<v Speaker 5>you've got to be like,</v>

4739
02:10:51.971 --> 02:10:52.661
<v Speaker 5>fuck them,</v>

4740
02:10:52.661 --> 02:10:53.680
<v Speaker 5>I'm doing this anyway.</v>

4741
02:10:53.810 --> 02:10:54.320
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4742
02:10:54.320 --> 02:10:54.771
<v Speaker 4>for sure.</v>

4743
02:10:54.771 --> 02:10:56.210
<v Speaker 4>Especially if they don't know who you are.</v>

4744
02:10:56.600 --> 02:10:56.960
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

4745
02:10:56.960 --> 02:10:57.180
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4746
02:10:57.180 --> 02:10:57.620
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4747
02:10:57.620 --> 02:10:58.010
<v Speaker 4>I will.</v>

4748
02:10:58.010 --> 02:10:59.810
<v Speaker 4>Once you got a ton of celebrity behind you,</v>

4749
02:10:59.811 --> 02:11:01.340
<v Speaker 4>I think it changes a little bit,</v>

4750
02:11:01.341 --> 02:11:03.260
<v Speaker 4>but do you find that because of your youtube videos,</v>

4751
02:11:03.261 --> 02:11:04.790
<v Speaker 4>you're very popular youtube channel,</v>

4752
02:11:04.810 --> 02:11:06.260
<v Speaker 4>does that make the biggest difference for you?</v>

4753
02:11:06.320 --> 02:11:07.760
<v Speaker 4>That's like been your sort of blog,</v>

4754
02:11:07.761 --> 02:11:08.030
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4755
02:11:08.030 --> 02:11:08.421
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4756
02:11:08.421 --> 02:11:09.980
<v Speaker 5>That's been the main thing that's made a difference,</v>

4757
02:11:09.981 --> 02:11:10.940
<v Speaker 5>a moment of clarity.</v>

4758
02:11:10.941 --> 02:11:11.690
<v Speaker 5>It's called and,</v>

4759
02:11:11.690 --> 02:11:12.170
<v Speaker 5>and uh,</v>

4760
02:11:12.170 --> 02:11:16.270
<v Speaker 5>started doing that three years ago to 180 episodes in now and uh,</v>

4761
02:11:16.510 --> 02:11:16.840
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

4762
02:11:16.840 --> 02:11:18.740
<v Speaker 5>and it's nice because that's like international.</v>

4763
02:11:18.741 --> 02:11:19.360
<v Speaker 5>It's like a,</v>

4764
02:11:19.360 --> 02:11:19.610
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4765
02:11:19.610 --> 02:11:21.580
<v Speaker 5>I can go toward the UK and I'm not,</v>

4766
02:11:21.730 --> 02:11:23.870
<v Speaker 5>I'm not saying I get billions of people to come out,</v>

4767
02:11:23.871 --> 02:11:24.860
<v Speaker 5>but there's fans everywhere,</v>

4768
02:11:24.861 --> 02:11:25.400
<v Speaker 5>which is really good.</v>

4769
02:11:25.400 --> 02:11:25.910
<v Speaker 4>Cool.</v>

4770
02:11:25.910 --> 02:11:28.070
<v Speaker 4>Just the most incredible thing about the internet.</v>

4771
02:11:28.100 --> 02:11:29.630
<v Speaker 4>It's like something like this podcast,</v>

4772
02:11:30.200 --> 02:11:31.460
<v Speaker 4>I would have never done this.</v>

4773
02:11:31.670 --> 02:11:34.160
<v Speaker 4>Internet didn't exist and aren't you still amazed when you get the fan from</v>

4774
02:11:34.161 --> 02:11:35.360
<v Speaker 4>Romania or whatever?</v>

4775
02:11:35.420 --> 02:11:36.540
<v Speaker 4>Like I'm amazed at all of it.</v>

4776
02:11:36.541 --> 02:11:37.040
<v Speaker 4>I'm amazing.</v>

4777
02:11:37.040 --> 02:11:38.210
<v Speaker 4>Anybody's listening this fucking thing.</v>

4778
02:11:38.640 --> 02:11:42.740
<v Speaker 4>It's just the whole idea of a podcast is incredible that you need this little</v>

4779
02:11:42.830 --> 02:11:43.510
<v Speaker 4>equipment.</v>

4780
02:11:43.510 --> 02:11:43.761
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4781
02:11:43.761 --> 02:11:44.594
<v Speaker 4>And then boom,</v>

4782
02:11:44.600 --> 02:11:45.980
<v Speaker 4>it's out there to millions of people.</v>

4783
02:11:46.070 --> 02:11:46.440
<v Speaker 5>I do.</v>

4784
02:11:46.440 --> 02:11:47.370
<v Speaker 5>I do a podcast too,</v>

4785
02:11:47.440 --> 02:11:49.620
<v Speaker 5>but the main thing is the moment clarity videos.</v>

4786
02:11:49.621 --> 02:11:50.170
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4787
02:11:50.170 --> 02:11:51.380
<v Speaker 4>What's the difference between your podcast,</v>

4788
02:11:51.390 --> 02:11:52.010
<v Speaker 4>the moment of clarity?</v>

4789
02:11:52.010 --> 02:11:52.570
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>

4790
02:11:52.570 --> 02:11:53.051
<v Speaker 4>Why is,</v>

4791
02:11:53.051 --> 02:11:53.560
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

4792
02:11:53.560 --> 02:11:55.650
<v Speaker 4>you put more effort into the moment of clarity things.</v>

4793
02:11:55.720 --> 02:11:56.450
<v Speaker 4>I put more up</v>

4794
02:11:56.450 --> 02:11:59.910
<v Speaker 5>the end of the videos and they're also short the three to five minutes,</v>

4795
02:11:59.940 --> 02:12:01.170
<v Speaker 5>whereas the podcast,</v>

4796
02:12:01.171 --> 02:12:01.351
<v Speaker 5>I'll,</v>

4797
02:12:01.351 --> 02:12:01.460
<v Speaker 5>I'll,</v>

4798
02:12:01.460 --> 02:12:02.170
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4799
02:12:02.170 --> 02:12:04.090
<v Speaker 4>talk about issues for half hour.</v>

4800
02:12:04.100 --> 02:12:06.550
<v Speaker 4>When you do a solo podcast or just you talking?</v>

4801
02:12:06.760 --> 02:12:07.541
<v Speaker 4>It's often sold,</v>

4802
02:12:07.541 --> 02:12:09.070
<v Speaker 4>although I will do interviews occasionally,</v>

4803
02:12:09.071 --> 02:12:10.360
<v Speaker 4>but a lot of times,</v>

4804
02:12:10.361 --> 02:12:12.520
<v Speaker 4>so I always say I'm going to do a solo podcast,</v>

4805
02:12:12.521 --> 02:12:13.840
<v Speaker 4>but I haven't done one since the beginning.</v>

4806
02:12:13.950 --> 02:12:15.400
<v Speaker 4>At the beginning I used to do solo once.</v>

4807
02:12:15.410 --> 02:12:17.310
<v Speaker 4>I used to just have ideas and just.</v>

4808
02:12:17.710 --> 02:12:19.390
<v Speaker 4>But it's too much work.</v>

4809
02:12:19.990 --> 02:12:20.321
<v Speaker 4>Also,</v>

4810
02:12:20.321 --> 02:12:21.340
<v Speaker 4>you got to carry the whole thing.</v>

4811
02:12:21.460 --> 02:12:26.460
<v Speaker 4>It's tough to carry a little bird as a few people that can actually cause that.</v>

4812
02:12:27.820 --> 02:12:28.241
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

4813
02:12:28.241 --> 02:12:28.630
<v Speaker 4>Bill Verge.</v>

4814
02:12:28.630 --> 02:12:28.811
<v Speaker 4>Great.</v>

4815
02:12:28.811 --> 02:12:29.030
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4816
02:12:29.030 --> 02:12:30.580
<v Speaker 4>that's perfect for that.</v>

4817
02:12:30.630 --> 02:12:32.600
<v Speaker 4>I guess you know like bills,</v>

4818
02:12:32.610 --> 02:12:34.480
<v Speaker 4>that type of guy that likes to talk over people,</v>

4819
02:12:34.780 --> 02:12:38.650
<v Speaker 4>but bill is the type of guy that has a lot of shit to say about a lot of shit</v>

4820
02:12:38.651 --> 02:12:40.240
<v Speaker 4>that maybe you wouldn't give a fuck about.</v>

4821
02:12:40.480 --> 02:12:42.370
<v Speaker 4>But bill get angry about something like,</v>

4822
02:12:42.460 --> 02:12:42.700
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

4823
02:12:42.700 --> 02:12:42.941
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

4824
02:12:42.941 --> 02:12:43.151
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

4825
02:12:43.151 --> 02:12:43.360
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

4826
02:12:43.360 --> 02:12:44.193
<v Speaker 4>Because what they're trying,</v>

4827
02:12:44.890 --> 02:12:46.960
<v Speaker 4>he'll go on these like really long rent.</v>

4828
02:12:46.961 --> 02:12:50.230
<v Speaker 4>So it's almost like for him it's perfect because for a lot of people they</v>

4829
02:12:50.231 --> 02:12:51.250
<v Speaker 4>wouldn't have that.</v>

4830
02:12:51.410 --> 02:12:54.550
<v Speaker 4>Like his sense of humor is so aggressive.</v>

4831
02:12:54.640 --> 02:12:55.660
<v Speaker 4>Boston,</v>

4832
02:12:55.990 --> 02:12:57.400
<v Speaker 4>you're not fucking me over.</v>

4833
02:12:57.401 --> 02:12:58.780
<v Speaker 4>I see what you're doing,</v>

4834
02:12:59.050 --> 02:12:59.770
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4835
02:12:59.770 --> 02:13:01.480
<v Speaker 4>one of his bits and I love the most,</v>

4836
02:13:01.540 --> 02:13:06.540
<v Speaker 4>is he does this bit about all these movies where there's a black team and the</v>

4837
02:13:07.271 --> 02:13:12.130
<v Speaker 4>black team has all these odds and all these racist and the white people trying</v>

4838
02:13:12.131 --> 02:13:13.060
<v Speaker 4>to keep down the black team.</v>

4839
02:13:13.061 --> 02:13:16.870
<v Speaker 4>Like how long are we going to make this movie?</v>

4840
02:13:16.900 --> 02:13:20.410
<v Speaker 4>It was one about synchronized swimming or running out of sports.</v>

4841
02:13:20.440 --> 02:13:20.700
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4842
02:13:20.700 --> 02:13:21.820
<v Speaker 4>Like they can't swim.</v>

4843
02:13:22.180 --> 02:13:23.220
<v Speaker 4>It's such a good bit.</v>

4844
02:13:23.230 --> 02:13:24.220
<v Speaker 4>It's such a funny bit,</v>

4845
02:13:24.580 --> 02:13:28.480
<v Speaker 4>but it's one of those things where it's such a bill burr bit,</v>

4846
02:13:28.540 --> 02:13:28.931
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4847
02:13:28.931 --> 02:13:31.030
<v Speaker 4>and it's such a Boston bit too.</v>

4848
02:13:31.050 --> 02:13:34.560
<v Speaker 4>It's like his style is one of my favorite styles.</v>

4849
02:13:34.561 --> 02:13:37.200
<v Speaker 4>That Boston aggressive style of comedy.</v>

4850
02:13:37.260 --> 02:13:37.930
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4851
02:13:37.930 --> 02:13:38.310
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4852
02:13:38.310 --> 02:13:39.840
<v Speaker 4>His Shit's great.</v>

4853
02:13:40.530 --> 02:13:40.801
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4854
02:13:40.801 --> 02:13:41.220
<v Speaker 4>And He.</v>

4855
02:13:41.220 --> 02:13:45.210
<v Speaker 4>So that style of ranting about shit lends itself perfectly to podcasts.</v>

4856
02:13:45.540 --> 02:13:45.960
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4857
02:13:45.960 --> 02:13:46.350
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4858
02:13:46.350 --> 02:13:46.770
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

4859
02:13:46.770 --> 02:13:47.603
<v Speaker 4>it's.</v>

4860
02:13:47.760 --> 02:13:49.590
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's the nice thing about what I do is,</v>

4861
02:13:49.591 --> 02:13:51.090
<v Speaker 4>is it still very ranty style?</v>

4862
02:13:51.091 --> 02:13:51.720
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>

4863
02:13:51.720 --> 02:13:52.180
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4864
02:13:52.180 --> 02:13:55.110
<v Speaker 4>it fits well on podcasts and it fits well and those videos.</v>

4865
02:13:55.230 --> 02:13:56.060
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>

4866
02:13:56.060 --> 02:13:56.370
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4867
02:13:56.370 --> 02:13:57.760
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't fit well on late night shows.</v>

4868
02:13:59.420 --> 02:14:00.340
<v Speaker 4>Gross man,</v>

4869
02:14:00.360 --> 02:14:01.440
<v Speaker 4>you don't need those anymore.</v>

4870
02:14:02.430 --> 02:14:04.320
<v Speaker 4>I really don't think people need those anymore.</v>

4871
02:14:04.410 --> 02:14:04.711
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4872
02:14:04.711 --> 02:14:05.730
<v Speaker 4>I'm not joking around.</v>

4873
02:14:05.731 --> 02:14:06.900
<v Speaker 4>I think they're nonsense.</v>

4874
02:14:06.901 --> 02:14:08.970
<v Speaker 4>I think those are just like silent movies,</v>

4875
02:14:09.270 --> 02:14:11.210
<v Speaker 4>like the why.</v>

4876
02:14:11.490 --> 02:14:12.290
<v Speaker 4>Why are you doing that?</v>

4877
02:14:12.290 --> 02:14:13.200
<v Speaker 4>Why are you doing it like that?</v>

4878
02:14:13.230 --> 02:14:14.063
<v Speaker 4>That's dumb.</v>

4879
02:14:14.960 --> 02:14:16.680
<v Speaker 4>Who would go to see a new silent movie?</v>

4880
02:14:18.620 --> 02:14:19.860
<v Speaker 4>I saw the hobbit last night.</v>

4881
02:14:19.861 --> 02:14:21.120
<v Speaker 4>It was fucking awesome.</v>

4882
02:14:21.350 --> 02:14:22.440
<v Speaker 4>It is in three d,</v>

4883
02:14:22.441 --> 02:14:23.221
<v Speaker 4>the dragons.</v>

4884
02:14:23.221 --> 02:14:23.790
<v Speaker 4>Incredible.</v>

4885
02:14:23.790 --> 02:14:24.780
<v Speaker 4>She's the one before it.</v>

4886
02:14:24.900 --> 02:14:25.720
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

4887
02:14:25.720 --> 02:14:26.280
<v Speaker 4>Did you like that?</v>

4888
02:14:26.280 --> 02:14:26.770
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

4889
02:14:26.770 --> 02:14:27.090
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

4890
02:14:27.090 --> 02:14:27.541
<v Speaker 4>That one.</v>

4891
02:14:27.541 --> 02:14:30.540
<v Speaker 4>I felt like it was a bunch of shit happening that was setting this one up.</v>

4892
02:14:31.020 --> 02:14:33.900
<v Speaker 4>Do the dragon is worth the price of admission.</v>

4893
02:14:33.960 --> 02:14:36.990
<v Speaker 4>So the trailer trailer looked pretty damn good.</v>

4894
02:14:37.050 --> 02:14:37.680
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

4895
02:14:37.680 --> 02:14:39.210
<v Speaker 4>the dragons to start the fucking movie.</v>

4896
02:14:39.211 --> 02:14:39.841
<v Speaker 4>I hope they don't kill them.</v>

4897
02:14:39.841 --> 02:14:43.230
<v Speaker 4>And the next one we're seeing the most of it or just like the very end.</v>

4898
02:14:43.231 --> 02:14:45.440
<v Speaker 4>You got to get to like halfway to the moon before the dragon comes out,</v>

4899
02:14:45.441 --> 02:14:46.950
<v Speaker 4>but there's no bad parts in the movie.</v>

4900
02:14:46.951 --> 02:14:47.940
<v Speaker 4>The movie is fun.</v>

4901
02:14:47.970 --> 02:14:49.350
<v Speaker 4>It's fun from the beginning to the end.</v>

4902
02:14:49.351 --> 02:14:50.880
<v Speaker 4>It's way better than the last one.</v>

4903
02:14:51.150 --> 02:14:52.830
<v Speaker 4>The last one to me was kind of flat,</v>

4904
02:14:53.010 --> 02:14:53.711
<v Speaker 4>but I think it was just,</v>

4905
02:14:53.711 --> 02:14:55.140
<v Speaker 4>there was so much to set up,</v>

4906
02:14:55.500 --> 02:14:58.950
<v Speaker 4>but this one fuck and wicked dude.</v>

4907
02:14:59.400 --> 02:15:00.360
<v Speaker 4>So wicked.</v>

4908
02:15:00.720 --> 02:15:01.980
<v Speaker 4>The dragon is so good.</v>

4909
02:15:01.981 --> 02:15:02.820
<v Speaker 4>He talks.</v>

4910
02:15:06.750 --> 02:15:07.560
<v Speaker 4>It's so cool.</v>

4911
02:15:07.560 --> 02:15:08.393
<v Speaker 4>Who Does the voice?</v>

4912
02:15:08.480 --> 02:15:08.790

<v Speaker 4>The original con.</v>

4917
02:15:14.610 --> 02:15:15.960
<v Speaker 4>Unfortunately rest his soul.</v>

4918
02:15:15.961 --> 02:15:16.950
<v Speaker 4>I don't think he's with us anymore,</v>

4919
02:15:17.400 --> 02:15:18.290
<v Speaker 4>but the other con,</v>

4920
02:15:18.630 --> 02:15:19.171

02:15:20.460 --> 02:15:21.270
<v Speaker 4>MMA Guy,</v>

4923
02:15:21.270 --> 02:15:22.103
<v Speaker 4>Joe Camacho,</v>

4924
02:15:22.170 --> 02:15:23.040
<v Speaker 4>the 41 years old.</v>

4925
02:15:23.041 --> 02:15:23.400
<v Speaker 4>I can't,</v>

4926
02:15:23.400 --> 02:15:24.233
<v Speaker 4>I can't believe it.</v>

4927
02:15:24.750 --> 02:15:26.720
<v Speaker 4>People are dying young some.</v>

4928
02:15:27.190 --> 02:15:31.260
<v Speaker 4>And you know what's also weird is he was such good health and he made it to the</v>

4929
02:15:31.261 --> 02:15:31.921
<v Speaker 4>hospital.</v>

4930
02:15:31.921 --> 02:15:32.731
<v Speaker 4>It sounded like.</v>

4931
02:15:32.731 --> 02:15:33.271
<v Speaker 4>It sounded like,</v>

4932
02:15:33.271 --> 02:15:33.421
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4933
02:15:33.421 --> 02:15:36.300
<v Speaker 4>if you read the report that the wife was said that she woke up,</v>

4934
02:15:36.360 --> 02:15:38.700
<v Speaker 4>he was screaming and they called the ambulance.</v>

4935
02:15:38.701 --> 02:15:40.020
<v Speaker 4>The ambulance came and then he,</v>

4936
02:15:40.021 --> 02:15:40.430
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4937
02:15:40.430 --> 02:15:42.120
<v Speaker 4>was announced dead at the hospital.</v>

4938
02:15:42.121 --> 02:15:43.890
<v Speaker 4>It seems like with heart attacks you always think,</v>

4939
02:15:44.100 --> 02:15:44.191
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

4940
02:15:44.191 --> 02:15:45.024
<v Speaker 4>you could revive them.</v>

4941
02:15:45.080 --> 02:15:45.810
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

4942
02:15:45.810 --> 02:15:46.920
<v Speaker 4>especially a healthy guy.</v>

4943
02:15:47.040 --> 02:15:47.221
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4944
02:15:47.221 --> 02:15:47.760
<v Speaker 4>I don't get it.</v>

4945
02:15:47.760 --> 02:15:51.090
<v Speaker 4>He just fought a couple of weeks ago and he's fighting still.</v>

02:15:51.090 --> 02:15:51.871
<v Speaker 4>It was 41 years old.</v>

4947
02:15:51.871 --> 02:15:53.880
<v Speaker 4>He ran a martial arts academy that guards in tremendous shape.</v>

<v Speaker 4>That's crazy.</v>

4951
02:15:56.310 --> 02:15:59.970
<v Speaker 4>Maybe the government man government is wanting to teach people how to kick ass</v>

4952
02:15:59.971 --> 02:16:00.804
<v Speaker 4>when they take over.</v>

4953
02:16:00.830 --> 02:16:01.740
<v Speaker 4>So it was bs.</v>

<v Speaker 4>It's fucking bs.</v>

02:16:05.670 --> 02:16:10.050
<v Speaker 4>there's a fucking article right here in the front of CNN about vitamins being a</v>

4958
02:16:10.051 --> 02:16:10.884
<v Speaker 4>waste of money.</v>

4959
02:16:10.950 --> 02:16:12.540
<v Speaker 4>Editorial and Medical Journal says,</v>

4960

02:16:20.030 --> 02:16:21.150
<v Speaker 4>taken in pill form.</v>

4965
02:16:21.780 --> 02:16:25.290
<v Speaker 4>It says the vitamins industry is based on anecdote.</v>

4966
02:16:25.291 --> 02:16:25.861
<v Speaker 4>People saying,</v>

4967

<v Speaker 4>I like this and it makes me feel better.</v>

4968
02:16:27.641 --> 02:16:27.860
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>

02:16:27.860 --> 02:16:28.601
<v Speaker 4>Dr Edgar Miller,</v>

4970
02:16:28.601 --> 02:16:31.150
<v Speaker 4>I'm professor of Medicine Epidemiologic Johns Hopkins,</v>

4971
02:16:31.300 --> 02:16:32.133
<v Speaker 6>you know what the problem is?</v>

4972
02:16:32.200 --> 02:16:33.700
<v Speaker 6>A lot of these guys that are saying this,</v>

4973
02:16:33.730 --> 02:16:36.550
<v Speaker 6>they're trying to get attention for their work and they're taking these</v>

4974
02:16:36.551 --> 02:16:40.180
<v Speaker 6>controversial stances because measuring someone's health and measuring whether</v>

4975
02:16:40.181 --> 02:16:43.420
<v Speaker 6>or not they would be healthier and not be healthy based on whether or not</v>

4976
02:16:43.421 --> 02:16:45.010
<v Speaker 6>they're taking vitamins is very tricky.</v>

4977
02:16:45.130 --> 02:16:48.100
<v Speaker 6>But we know for a fact that vitamins cure a lot of shit.</v>

4978
02:16:48.101 --> 02:16:49.660
<v Speaker 6>Scurvy take vitamin C,</v>

4979
02:16:49.750 --> 02:16:50.583
<v Speaker 6>scurvy goes away.</v>

4980
02:16:50.600 --> 02:16:50.940
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

4981
02:16:50.940 --> 02:16:53.830
<v Speaker 6>we know for a fact that supplementing vitamins has a positive effect on the</v>

4982
02:16:53.831 --> 02:16:54.340
<v Speaker 6>human body.</v>

4983
02:16:54.340 --> 02:16:56.350
<v Speaker 6>And apparently there's a lot of good tests for vitamin D.</v>

4984
02:16:56.470 --> 02:16:57.550
<v Speaker 6>it's all science.</v>

4985
02:16:57.610 --> 02:17:02.260
<v Speaker 6>I mean the reason why we can break these molecules down to individual components</v>

4986
02:17:02.261 --> 02:17:02.891
<v Speaker 6>like vitamin A,</v>

4987
02:17:02.891 --> 02:17:03.371
<v Speaker 6>vitamin C,</v>

4988
02:17:03.371 --> 02:17:04.710
<v Speaker 6>vitamin D is because of fucking sciences,</v>

4989
02:17:04.711 --> 02:17:07.510
<v Speaker 6>because they realize there's an effect that each one has its variable.</v>

4990
02:17:07.511 --> 02:17:08.050
<v Speaker 6>There are different.</v>

4991
02:17:08.050 --> 02:17:09.010
<v Speaker 6>They're different from each other.</v>

4992
02:17:09.260 --> 02:17:11.710
<v Speaker 6>The idea that supplements don't do you any good?</v>

4993
02:17:11.950 --> 02:17:13.240
<v Speaker 6>I bet this guy is as shape,</v>

4994
02:17:13.270 --> 02:17:14.440
<v Speaker 6>but he doesn't exercise,</v>

4995
02:17:14.470 --> 02:17:15.610
<v Speaker 6>but he doesn't know his body.</v>

4996
02:17:15.850 --> 02:17:17.390
<v Speaker 6>It's nonsense vitamins for sure.</v>

4997
02:17:17.391 --> 02:17:18.224
<v Speaker 6>If I can help you.</v>

4998
02:17:18.660 --> 02:17:18.880
<v Speaker 6>They.</v>

4999
02:17:18.880 --> 02:17:21.580
<v Speaker 6>It says vitamins didn't prevent mortality in any way.</v>

5000
02:17:21.590 --> 02:17:22.210
<v Speaker 6>In addition,</v>

5001
02:17:22.210 --> 02:17:22.391
<v Speaker 6>what?</v>

5002
02:17:22.391 --> 02:17:22.481
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

5003
02:17:22.481 --> 02:17:23.314
<v Speaker 6>how can you tell?</v>

5004
02:17:23.380 --> 02:17:24.760
<v Speaker 6>How do you know if someone would have lived?</v>

5005
02:17:24.761 --> 02:17:28.090
<v Speaker 6>They didn't have vitamins and died because he took vitamins or died because they</v>

5006
02:17:28.091 --> 02:17:29.830
<v Speaker 6>didn't have vitamins and would have lived.</v>

5007
02:17:29.831 --> 02:17:30.130
<v Speaker 6>They did.</v>

5008
02:17:30.130 --> 02:17:30.790
<v Speaker 6>You don't.</v>

5009
02:17:30.790 --> 02:17:32.470
<v Speaker 6>The only way to do it is to take to people.</v>

5010
02:17:32.590 --> 02:17:34.030
<v Speaker 6>Have them live the exact same life.</v>

5011
02:17:34.031 --> 02:17:34.990
<v Speaker 6>One guy takes vitamins,</v>

5012
02:17:34.991 --> 02:17:37.000
<v Speaker 6>one guy doesn't test their blood along the way.</v>

5013
02:17:37.001 --> 02:17:38.470
<v Speaker 6>They have the same life experiences,</v>

5014
02:17:38.480 --> 02:17:39.221
<v Speaker 6>same stress,</v>

5015
02:17:39.221 --> 02:17:39.980
<v Speaker 6>the same.</v>

5016
02:17:39.980 --> 02:17:40.601
<v Speaker 6>You can't do that.</v>

5017
02:17:40.601 --> 02:17:41.230
<v Speaker 6>Obviously.</v>

5018
02:17:41.230 --> 02:17:43.150
<v Speaker 6>There's a lot of variables when it comes to human health.</v>

5019
02:17:43.151 --> 02:17:43.931
<v Speaker 6>Stress,</v>

5020
02:17:43.931 --> 02:17:44.800
<v Speaker 6>your lifestyle,</v>

5021
02:17:44.801 --> 02:17:46.120
<v Speaker 6>the pollution that you live in.</v>

5022
02:17:46.300 --> 02:17:46.961
<v Speaker 6>There's a lot of things,</v>

5023
02:17:46.961 --> 02:17:50.890
<v Speaker 6>but to say that the building blocks of the human body,</v>

5024
02:17:50.891 --> 02:17:54.070
<v Speaker 6>new nutritional supplements like vitamin A,</v>

5025
02:17:54.100 --> 02:17:54.461
<v Speaker 6>D,</v>

5026
02:17:54.461 --> 02:17:54.970
<v Speaker 6>C,</v>

5027
02:17:54.970 --> 02:17:55.181
<v Speaker 6>b,</v>

5028
02:17:55.181 --> 02:17:58.420
<v Speaker 6>12 ones that we know absolutely beneficially about it.</v>

5029
02:17:58.570 --> 02:18:01.990
<v Speaker 6>They don't inject vitamin B 12 into athletes because it doesn't help.</v>

5030
02:18:02.470 --> 02:18:04.000
<v Speaker 6>They injected because it's awesome.</v>

5031
02:18:04.250 --> 02:18:06.580
<v Speaker 6>Like if you ever had take vitamin B,</v>

5032
02:18:06.581 --> 02:18:07.414
<v Speaker 6>12 supplements,</v>

5033
02:18:08.020 --> 02:18:08.681
<v Speaker 6>it's fucking great.</v>

5034
02:18:08.681 --> 02:18:09.940
<v Speaker 6>It gives you energy label.</v>

5035
02:18:09.970 --> 02:18:10.721
<v Speaker 6>Some will be at 12.</v>

5036
02:18:10.721 --> 02:18:11.800
<v Speaker 6>You spray it under your tongue,</v>

5037
02:18:11.950 --> 02:18:13.630
<v Speaker 6>like give yourself a big dose of [inaudible].</v>

5038
02:18:13.780 --> 02:18:14.613
<v Speaker 6>It's fucking.</v>

5039
02:18:14.810 --> 02:18:16.490
<v Speaker 5>Does it depend on the way you take it in,</v>

5040
02:18:16.491 --> 02:18:17.730
<v Speaker 5>like whether it's a pill or a.</v>

5041
02:18:18.140 --> 02:18:18.910
<v Speaker 6>well it,</v>

5042
02:18:18.910 --> 02:18:19.180
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

5043
02:18:19.180 --> 02:18:23.510
<v Speaker 6>the injectable b12 is the best and there's some forms of vitamin C that's more</v>

5044
02:18:23.511 --> 02:18:24.830
<v Speaker 6>easily absorbed by the body.</v>

5045
02:18:24.831 --> 02:18:27.530
<v Speaker 6>But what can't be disputed when these guys say,</v>

5046
02:18:27.531 --> 02:18:30.390
<v Speaker 6>when they're doing studies and me to you,</v>

5047
02:18:30.740 --> 02:18:31.573
<v Speaker 6>it doesn't work.</v>

5048
02:18:31.580 --> 02:18:33.050
<v Speaker 6>You can't do a study like that.</v>

5049
02:18:33.320 --> 02:18:37.280
<v Speaker 6>What we know for a fact is that people need vitamins.</v>

5050
02:18:37.340 --> 02:18:37.911
<v Speaker 6>You need them,</v>

5051
02:18:37.911 --> 02:18:38.960
<v Speaker 6>you need them in your food,</v>

5052
02:18:39.050 --> 02:18:39.883
<v Speaker 6>you need them,</v>

5053
02:18:39.980 --> 02:18:41.120
<v Speaker 6>you need them in your,</v>

5054
02:18:41.121 --> 02:18:41.990
<v Speaker 6>your nutrients,</v>

5055
02:18:42.020 --> 02:18:42.890
<v Speaker 6>in your food.</v>

5056
02:18:42.891 --> 02:18:45.860
<v Speaker 6>You need to have building blocks for repair.</v>

5057
02:18:46.070 --> 02:18:47.780
<v Speaker 6>You need to give your body protein.</v>

5058
02:18:47.781 --> 02:18:49.100
<v Speaker 6>You need to give your body carbohydrates.</v>

5059
02:18:49.360 --> 02:18:50.450
<v Speaker 6>And so we understand all that.</v>

5060
02:18:50.480 --> 02:18:50.850
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

5061
02:18:50.850 --> 02:18:54.290
<v Speaker 6>There's a reason why they've broken these vitamins down into individual</v>

5062
02:18:54.380 --> 02:18:57.350
<v Speaker 6>components because they know what each one does it.</v>

5063
02:18:57.351 --> 02:18:58.090
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

5064
02:18:58.090 --> 02:18:58.271
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

5065
02:18:58.271 --> 02:18:58.781
<v Speaker 5>in the news,</v>

5066
02:18:58.781 --> 02:19:00.000
<v Speaker 5>I mean this is another media thing.</v>

5067
02:19:00.010 --> 02:19:01.210
<v Speaker 5>The media loves a story,</v>

5068
02:19:01.211 --> 02:19:03.790
<v Speaker 5>like either vitamins do everything or vitamins do nothing.</v>

5069
02:19:03.800 --> 02:19:04.960
<v Speaker 5>Because that gets readers,</v>

5070
02:19:05.370 --> 02:19:05.860
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5071
02:19:05.860 --> 02:19:06.041
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

5072
02:19:06.041 --> 02:19:06.940
<v Speaker 5>it's a gray area,</v>

5073
02:19:06.941 --> 02:19:07.541
<v Speaker 5>or oh,</v>

5074
02:19:07.541 --> 02:19:10.120
<v Speaker 5>they probably do something or none of those articles getting read.</v>

5075
02:19:10.160 --> 02:19:11.710
<v Speaker 5>So instead you put the article like,</v>

5076
02:19:11.711 --> 02:19:11.981
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

5077
02:19:11.981 --> 02:19:13.360
<v Speaker 5>this guy says they do nothing.</v>

5078
02:19:13.690 --> 02:19:14.200
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

5079
02:19:14.200 --> 02:19:15.290
<v Speaker 5>This is one of the guys</v>

5080
02:19:15.850 --> 02:19:17.770
<v Speaker 6>a retort to it.</v>

5081
02:19:17.771 --> 02:19:19.070
<v Speaker 6>So they believe vitamins,</v>

5082
02:19:19.420 --> 02:19:20.111
<v Speaker 6>multivitamins,</v>

5083
02:19:20.111 --> 02:19:22.030
<v Speaker 6>addressing nutritional deficiencies in people.</v>

5084
02:19:22.240 --> 02:19:24.280
<v Speaker 6>We don't believe that they're the answer to all life ailments,</v>

5085
02:19:24.281 --> 02:19:25.930
<v Speaker 6>such as the editorial suggests,</v>

5086
02:19:26.110 --> 02:19:29.810
<v Speaker 6>and I think that's one of the problems with saying that vitamins don't help is</v>

5087
02:19:30.620 --> 02:19:31.453
<v Speaker 6>without a doubt.</v>

5088
02:19:31.490 --> 02:19:33.080
<v Speaker 6>Nutritional deficiencies are not good for you.</v>

5089
02:19:33.110 --> 02:19:35.690
<v Speaker 6>You can live through them and you could live a dollar life,</v>

5090
02:19:35.840 --> 02:19:38.420
<v Speaker 6>but if you take good food into your body,</v>

5091
02:19:38.421 --> 02:19:39.440
<v Speaker 6>you will feel better.</v>

5092
02:19:39.590 --> 02:19:41.960
<v Speaker 6>And the reason for that is nutrients for sure.</v>

5093
02:19:41.961 --> 02:19:43.520
<v Speaker 6>You should get it from live food,</v>

5094
02:19:43.790 --> 02:19:47.450
<v Speaker 6>from vegetables and from fresh vegetables and fresh meats.</v>

5095
02:19:47.630 --> 02:19:48.351
<v Speaker 6>That's for sure.</v>

5096
02:19:48.351 --> 02:19:50.990
<v Speaker 6>We should get your vitamins if you can eat a balanced out that way,</v>

5097
02:19:51.350 --> 02:19:53.840
<v Speaker 6>but supplementing is better than not supplementing.</v>

5098
02:19:53.900 --> 02:19:54.733
<v Speaker 6>It just is.</v>

5099
02:19:54.830 --> 02:19:56.270
<v Speaker 6>I mean it's pretty much proven</v>

5100
02:19:56.510 --> 02:19:56.790
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

5101
02:19:56.790 --> 02:20:00.440
<v Speaker 5>and we don't always understand what those deficiencies due to our brain.</v>

5102
02:20:00.441 --> 02:20:01.430
<v Speaker 5>Whereas physically,</v>

5103
02:20:01.431 --> 02:20:02.600
<v Speaker 5>if you could see if you're getting fat,</v>

5104
02:20:02.601 --> 02:20:04.110
<v Speaker 5>you can see if you're getting out of a,</v>

5105
02:20:04.210 --> 02:20:04.930
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5106
02:20:04.930 --> 02:20:05.631
<v Speaker 5>unhealthy or whatever,</v>

5107
02:20:05.631 --> 02:20:05.900
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

5108
02:20:05.900 --> 02:20:08.720
<v Speaker 5>but brain activity intelligence,</v>

5109
02:20:08.721 --> 02:20:09.680
<v Speaker 5>like we can't see that.</v>

5110
02:20:09.681 --> 02:20:12.470
<v Speaker 5>So we don't know what eating all this shit does to our brain.</v>

5111
02:20:12.560 --> 02:20:13.190
<v Speaker 6>No doubt.</v>

5112
02:20:13.190 --> 02:20:13.580
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

5113
02:20:13.580 --> 02:20:15.410
<v Speaker 6>you want to really clean up your body.</v>

5114
02:20:15.411 --> 02:20:16.430
<v Speaker 6>You want to really be healthy,</v>

5115
02:20:16.880 --> 02:20:18.740
<v Speaker 6>cut out the processed food first,</v>

5116
02:20:18.830 --> 02:20:20.000
<v Speaker 6>just cut out all that stuff.</v>

5117
02:20:20.030 --> 02:20:21.200
<v Speaker 6>If you can cut out,</v>

5118
02:20:21.590 --> 02:20:22.850
<v Speaker 6>cut out all the stuff.</v>

5119
02:20:22.851 --> 02:20:26.060
<v Speaker 6>That's not just natural things that animals have been eating forever,</v>

5120
02:20:26.061 --> 02:20:27.650
<v Speaker 6>like vegetables and meat and eggs,</v>

5121
02:20:27.651 --> 02:20:28.490
<v Speaker 6>all the normal stuff.</v>

5122
02:20:28.790 --> 02:20:29.900
<v Speaker 6>As soon as you cut out all that stuff.</v>

5123
02:20:29.930 --> 02:20:30.471
<v Speaker 6>Even dairy.</v>

5124
02:20:30.471 --> 02:20:31.670
<v Speaker 6>I've started cutting out dairy.</v>

5125
02:20:31.880 --> 02:20:32.600
<v Speaker 6>God dammit.</v>

5126
02:20:32.600 --> 02:20:34.430
<v Speaker 6>I was listening to Tony Hinchcliffe the other day and I was like,</v>

5127
02:20:34.431 --> 02:20:35.510
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to cut out dairy,</v>

5128
02:20:35.511 --> 02:20:36.350
<v Speaker 6>but if you do</v>

5129
02:20:36.760 --> 02:20:37.390
<v Speaker 2>you feel better.</v>

5130
02:20:37.390 --> 02:20:38.223
<v Speaker 2>Super Twink,</v>

5131
02:20:38.290 --> 02:20:38.920
<v Speaker 2>super twitches.</v>

5132
02:20:38.920 --> 02:20:39.753
<v Speaker 2>New Name.</v>

5133
02:20:39.880 --> 02:20:40.810
<v Speaker 2>Don't refer to them as anything.</v>

5134
02:20:40.811 --> 02:20:41.320
<v Speaker 2>Other than that.</v>

5135
02:20:41.320 --> 02:20:42.020
<v Speaker 2>He's happy with it.</v>

5136
02:20:42.020 --> 02:20:42.760
<v Speaker 2>I was going with it.</v>

5137
02:20:42.760 --> 02:20:46.450
<v Speaker 5>Didn't we get like this country got crazy into like milk and dairy after like a</v>

5138
02:20:46.451 --> 02:20:47.590
<v Speaker 5>lobbying campaign when it.</v>

5139
02:20:47.700 --> 02:20:48.490
<v Speaker 5>Was that what it was?</v>

5140
02:20:48.490 --> 02:20:48.971
<v Speaker 5>I think so.</v>

5141
02:20:48.971 --> 02:20:50.410
<v Speaker 5>I think like in the fifties and sixties,</v>

5142
02:20:50.411 --> 02:20:51.244
<v Speaker 5>like milk,</v>

5143
02:20:51.320 --> 02:20:52.420
<v Speaker 5>like dairy farmers said,</v>

5144
02:20:52.421 --> 02:20:53.030
<v Speaker 5>hey yeah,</v>

5145
02:20:53.030 --> 02:20:56.170
<v Speaker 5>give you a glass of milk everyday of the week or whatever every morning,</v>

5146
02:20:57.020 --> 02:21:00.160
<v Speaker 5>but I feel like we weren't as big into it before that</v>

5147
02:21:00.890 --> 02:21:01.371
<v Speaker 6>maybe.</v>

5148
02:21:01.371 --> 02:21:01.551
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

5149
02:21:01.551 --> 02:21:02.384
<v Speaker 6>it makes sense.</v>

5150
02:21:02.450 --> 02:21:03.261
<v Speaker 6>Totally makes sense.</v>

5151
02:21:03.261 --> 02:21:05.270
<v Speaker 6>It makes sense that they would try to,</v>

5152
02:21:05.290 --> 02:21:06.123
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

5153
02:21:06.350 --> 02:21:07.190
<v Speaker 6>try to do that.</v>

5154
02:21:07.760 --> 02:21:08.120
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

5155
02:21:08.120 --> 02:21:08.410
<v Speaker 6>look,</v>

5156
02:21:08.410 --> 02:21:08.900
<v Speaker 6>they,</v>

5157
02:21:08.900 --> 02:21:10.550
<v Speaker 6>whenever there's a way to make more money,</v>

5158
02:21:10.670 --> 02:21:11.960
<v Speaker 6>if there's a way to make money,</v>

5159
02:21:12.230 --> 02:21:13.130
<v Speaker 6>that's what they do.</v>

5160
02:21:13.160 --> 02:21:15.500
<v Speaker 6>Can we make more money by pretending people need milk?</v>

5161
02:21:15.501 --> 02:21:17.570
<v Speaker 6>Let's fucking a glass of milk a day.</v>

5162
02:21:17.571 --> 02:21:20.720
<v Speaker 6>It's shown to make your children grow an extra entry here.</v>

5163
02:21:21.180 --> 02:21:21.440
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

5164
02:21:21.440 --> 02:21:24.740
<v Speaker 6>back in the old days they would talk about pall mall loves being our pall malls.</v>

5165
02:21:24.741 --> 02:21:25.660
<v Speaker 6>Being the cigarettes at.</v>

5169
02:21:29.430 --> 02:21:32.810
<v Speaker 2>It was like a four out of five doctors love camels or whatever.</v>

5170
02:21:34.760 --> 02:21:36.680
<v Speaker 2>And that was our parent's lifetime.</v>

5171
02:21:37.070 --> 02:21:39.410
<v Speaker 2>They were the fifties,</v>

5172
02:21:39.411 --> 02:21:40.790
<v Speaker 2>maybe sixties.</v>

5173
02:21:40.791 --> 02:21:42.240
<v Speaker 2>When was that fits in?</v>

5174
02:21:42.320 --> 02:21:43.153
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

<v Speaker 2>67.</v>

5179
02:21:46.730 --> 02:21:48.710

<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

02:21:57.581 --> 02:21:58.520
<v Speaker 2>It's a low joke.</v>

02:22:06.621 --> 02:22:07.340
<v Speaker 2>Dr. Ads.</v>

5195
02:22:07.340 --> 02:22:12.340
<v Speaker 2>That's what a Johnny Carson used to smoke until his lungs became these black,</v>

5196
02:22:12.411 --> 02:22:17.411
<v Speaker 2>shriveled up things dangling from his neck rattling around inside of his</v>

5197
02:22:18.411 --> 02:22:19.460
<v Speaker 2>wheezing chest.</v>

5198
02:22:20.280 --> 02:22:23.620
<v Speaker 2>More Dr. smoke camels than any other cigarettes though it says,</v>

5199
02:22:25.730 --> 02:22:26.060

02:22:26.840 --> 02:22:28.610
<v Speaker 4>That's so crazy.</v>

5202
02:22:29.090 --> 02:22:32.390
<v Speaker 4>They used to do that to watch those old movies or someone go to the doctor and</v>

5203
02:22:32.391 --> 02:22:34.100
<v Speaker 4>the doctor would be smoking cigarettes in the office.</v>

5204
02:22:34.150 --> 02:22:34.983
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

5205
02:22:35.290 --> 02:22:35.501
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

02:22:53.700 --> 02:22:54.790
<v Speaker 4>So crazy that that was.</v>

5215
02:22:54.791 --> 02:22:55.121

5216
02:22:55.121 --> 02:22:57.460
<v Speaker 4>it couldn't have been any earlier than the forties or fifties.</v>

5217
02:22:57.670 --> 02:23:01.120
<v Speaker 4>That's how quickly things evolve and that's not even 100 years,</v>

5218
02:23:01.121 --> 02:23:01.451

5244
02:23:39.261 --> 02:23:41.860
<v Speaker 5>One of the dudes that was behind some of these campaigns that,</v>

<v Speaker 5>smoking.</v>

<v Speaker 5>We can't prove smoking harms people.</v>

5248
02:23:45.320 --> 02:23:48.230
<v Speaker 5>It's the same dude that's in charge of climate denial stuff.</v>

02:23:48.231 --> 02:23:48.471
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Just put some doubt in people's minds.</v>

5252
02:23:50.960 --> 02:23:51.793
<v Speaker 5>You can't prove it.</v>

5256
02:23:58.670 --> 02:23:59.940
<v Speaker 4>the climate change expert,</v>

5257
02:23:59.950 --> 02:24:02.020
<v Speaker 4>the highest paid guy was fucking.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

5261
02:24:05.800 --> 02:24:08.090
<v Speaker 4>things like that make you wonder about the simulation.</v>

5262
02:24:08.100 --> 02:24:09.430
<v Speaker 4>He's like the fake translator.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Find a way to get into the.</v>

02:24:11.711 --> 02:24:12.790
<v Speaker 4>we didn't talk about that yet.</v>

5266
02:24:12.820 --> 02:24:15.220
<v Speaker 4>That's one of the weirdest things ever on television.</v>

5267
02:24:15.310 --> 02:24:19.300
<v Speaker 4>This guy at the Nelson Mandela funeral was not only faking,</v>

5268
02:24:19.330 --> 02:24:20.800
<v Speaker 4>being able to translate sign language.</v>

<v Speaker 4>And he was three feet away from the fucking president.</v>

5273
02:24:33.311 --> 02:24:33.790
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

5274
02:24:33.790 --> 02:24:34.380

5275
02:24:34.380 --> 02:24:37.200
<v Speaker 5>translate pretending to translate all these speeches that I</v>

5276
02:24:37.270 --> 02:24:39.640
<v Speaker 4>have a full on schizophrenia episode apparently.</v>

5277
02:24:39.690 --> 02:24:39.901
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

5278
02:24:39.901 --> 02:24:40.660
<v Speaker 4>that's what he claims.</v>

5279
02:24:40.660 --> 02:24:40.781
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

5280
02:24:40.781 --> 02:24:41.351
<v Speaker 4>that's what he says.</v>

5281
02:24:41.351 --> 02:24:41.920
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5282
02:24:41.920 --> 02:24:44.080
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it's just a con man foot is.</v>

5283
02:24:44.081 --> 02:24:48.520
<v Speaker 4>That was an angry group that burned two men to death while he was in an angry</v>

5284
02:24:48.521 --> 02:24:50.470
<v Speaker 4>group that burned to mendot death.</v>

5285
02:24:50.860 --> 02:24:51.820
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

5286
02:24:52.690 --> 02:24:53.490
<v Speaker 4>where you at?</v>

5287
02:24:53.490 --> 02:24:54.140
<v Speaker 4>See?</v>

5288
02:24:54.140 --> 02:24:54.973
<v Speaker 4>So crazy.</v>

5289
02:24:55.090 --> 02:24:55.923
<v Speaker 4>Where you at?</v>

5290
02:24:56.740 --> 02:24:57.573
<v Speaker 4>Where you at?</v>

5291
02:25:00.270 --> 02:25:01.720
<v Speaker 4>I think people got upset about.</v>

5292
02:25:01.721 --> 02:25:03.160
<v Speaker 4>Remember when we talked about that on the podcast?</v>

5293
02:25:03.161 --> 02:25:06.100
<v Speaker 4>Why do black people talk on the speakerphone and people why you go see black</v>

5294
02:25:06.101 --> 02:25:06.520
<v Speaker 4>people?</v>

5295
02:25:06.520 --> 02:25:07.353
<v Speaker 4>Because they do.</v>

5296
02:25:07.690 --> 02:25:10.180
<v Speaker 4>I'm just saying nothing wrong with talking your speakerphone,</v>

5297
02:25:10.390 --> 02:25:13.480
<v Speaker 4>but do you tell me why the black people talking speaker speakerphone like that?</v>

5298
02:25:13.720 --> 02:25:14.620
<v Speaker 4>They do that a lot.</v>

5299
02:25:15.010 --> 02:25:16.060
<v Speaker 4>They don't do it as much anymore.</v>

5300
02:25:16.061 --> 02:25:19.750
<v Speaker 4>That's kind of dropped off or maybe not as hanging out as many black people and</v>

5301
02:25:19.760 --> 02:25:20.740
<v Speaker 4>we talking like Bluetooth.</v>

5302
02:25:21.300 --> 02:25:21.550
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

5303
02:25:21.550 --> 02:25:23.970
<v Speaker 4>they would have their phone on speaker so they'd</v>

5304
02:25:23.980 --> 02:25:24.490
<v Speaker 2>be standing there.</v>

5305
02:25:24.490 --> 02:25:25.151
<v Speaker 2>What's up dog?</v>

5306
02:25:25.151 --> 02:25:25.990
<v Speaker 2>We do a man</v>

5307
02:25:26.130 --> 02:25:27.660
<v Speaker 6>and then they would talk like the guy would be like,</v>

5308
02:25:27.900 --> 02:25:28.411
<v Speaker 6>Yo man,</v>

5309
02:25:28.411 --> 02:25:28.871
<v Speaker 6>you know me.</v>

5310
02:25:28.871 --> 02:25:29.450
<v Speaker 6>I just telling them.</v>

5311
02:25:29.450 --> 02:25:29.580
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

5312
02:25:29.580 --> 02:25:31.950
<v Speaker 6>and you'd be able to hear both sides of the conversation.</v>

5313
02:25:33.470 --> 02:25:35.940
<v Speaker 6>They wanted to let you know that they don't hold their phone up through here.</v>

5314
02:25:36.210 --> 02:25:37.043
<v Speaker 6>That's the new style.</v>

5315
02:25:37.260 --> 02:25:38.093
<v Speaker 6>But people don't.</v>

5316
02:25:38.800 --> 02:25:40.590
<v Speaker 6>You think that no white girls do it.</v>

5317
02:25:40.591 --> 02:25:43.590
<v Speaker 6>I guess maybe there's nothing wrong with doing it.</v>

5318
02:25:43.680 --> 02:25:43.920
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

5319
02:25:43.920 --> 02:25:47.320
<v Speaker 6>So what if I hear one side of your conversation or two sides of your</v>

5320
02:25:47.321 --> 02:25:48.154
<v Speaker 6>conversation?</v>

5321
02:25:48.300 --> 02:25:49.290
<v Speaker 6>It doesn't mean fuck all.</v>

5322
02:25:49.291 --> 02:25:50.700
<v Speaker 6>To me it's the same thing.</v>

5323
02:25:50.940 --> 02:25:52.230
<v Speaker 6>If I hear you talking on the phone,</v>

5324
02:25:52.231 --> 02:25:54.480
<v Speaker 6>if you you're having this conversation and I don't hear the guy on the other</v>

5325
02:25:54.481 --> 02:25:55.140
<v Speaker 6>end,</v>

5326
02:25:55.140 --> 02:25:55.973
<v Speaker 6>it's not better.</v>

5327
02:25:56.500 --> 02:25:57.240
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

5328
02:25:57.240 --> 02:25:58.560
<v Speaker 6>it's just a conversation I'm hearing.</v>

5329
02:25:58.650 --> 02:25:59.520
<v Speaker 6>It's not a bad thing.</v>

5330
02:25:59.670 --> 02:26:01.760
<v Speaker 6>So if you choose to have your friend on speakerphone,</v>

5331
02:26:01.770 --> 02:26:04.890
<v Speaker 6>he talked to them and you want the whole world to hear the full conversation.</v>

5332
02:26:05.040 --> 02:26:05.940
<v Speaker 6>What do I give a shit?</v>

5333
02:26:06.750 --> 02:26:08.190
<v Speaker 6>I don't have a problem with it at all.</v>

5334
02:26:08.330 --> 02:26:09.151
<v Speaker 6>It logically,</v>

5335
02:26:09.151 --> 02:26:11.080
<v Speaker 6>to me it's just the same as one person talking.</v>

5336
02:26:11.081 --> 02:26:12.150
<v Speaker 6>It's not hurting my feelings,</v>

5337
02:26:12.570 --> 02:26:15.280
<v Speaker 6>but I think it's weird that black people enjoy that,</v>

5338
02:26:15.560 --> 02:26:17.190
<v Speaker 6>that they like to put the phone on speakerphone.</v>

5339
02:26:17.950 --> 02:26:19.950
<v Speaker 2>Did so it's like yelling at the movie theaters.</v>

5340
02:26:20.190 --> 02:26:20.791
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

5341
02:26:20.791 --> 02:26:23.880
<v Speaker 2>that's rude because yelling at the movie theaters interrupt something for other</v>

5342
02:26:23.881 --> 02:26:24.480
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

5343
02:26:24.480 --> 02:26:25.860
<v Speaker 2>Like you go to see smog,</v>

5344
02:26:26.100 --> 02:26:27.570
<v Speaker 2>you want to see a dragon talk,</v>

5345
02:26:27.810 --> 02:26:28.170
<v Speaker 2>you wanna,</v>

5346
02:26:28.170 --> 02:26:29.040
<v Speaker 2>you wanna hear somebody go,</v>

5347
02:26:29.280 --> 02:26:29.491
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

5348
02:26:29.491 --> 02:26:31.860
<v Speaker 2>you don't fucked up now bill ball.</v>

5349
02:26:33.200 --> 02:26:34.130

<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

5353
02:26:41.430 --> 02:26:42.420
<v Speaker 6>I think that's rude,</v>

5354
02:26:42.720 --> 02:26:45.870
<v Speaker 6>but if you're outside the movies here and the movie's out and be like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I can't.</v>

5397
02:27:29.810 --> 02:27:30.611
<v Speaker 2>I can't watch that.</v>

5398
02:27:30.611 --> 02:27:31.080
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

5399
02:27:31.080 --> 02:27:32.200
<v Speaker 2>the one I was talking about earlier,</v>

5400
02:27:32.201 --> 02:27:33.820
<v Speaker 2>the Orca and the black one,</v>

5401
02:27:33.821 --> 02:27:35.480
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to watch the fish.</v>

5402
02:27:36.030 --> 02:27:36.950
<v Speaker 2>That's real</v>

5403
02:27:37.140 --> 02:27:38.610
<v Speaker 6>pressing because that's real life.</v>

5404
02:27:38.820 --> 02:27:43.820
<v Speaker 6>That's even to me worse than a depressing movie about a fictional character,</v>

5405
02:27:44.430 --> 02:27:44.881
<v Speaker 6>but I don't.</v>

5406
02:27:44.881 --> 02:27:45.211
<v Speaker 6>I don't want.</v>

5407
02:27:45.211 --> 02:27:46.590
<v Speaker 6>I don't go to the pressing movies anymore,</v>

5408
02:27:46.680 --> 02:27:48.300
<v Speaker 6>but I did go see Dallas buyers club,</v>

5409
02:27:49.170 --> 02:27:50.580
<v Speaker 6>but it wasn't really that depressing.</v>

5410
02:27:50.630 --> 02:27:52.020
<v Speaker 6>It was just kind of crazy.</v>

5411
02:27:53.220 --> 02:27:54.720
<v Speaker 6>Is another stock market one,</v>

5412
02:27:54.721 --> 02:27:55.110
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

5413
02:27:55.110 --> 02:27:55.381
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

5414
02:27:55.381 --> 02:27:55.531
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>

5415
02:27:55.531 --> 02:27:56.520
<v Speaker 6>It's about act,</v>

5416
02:27:56.550 --> 02:28:00.900
<v Speaker 6>about the use of act to treat aids patients and about how they just unloaded act</v>

5417
02:28:00.901 --> 02:28:01.400
<v Speaker 6>on people.</v>

5418
02:28:01.400 --> 02:28:04.230
<v Speaker 6>Human trials of act that dropping like flies.</v>

5419
02:28:04.590 --> 02:28:06.780
<v Speaker 6>People using act for cancer medication.</v>

5420
02:28:06.781 --> 02:28:10.060
<v Speaker 6>It was killing more people than the cancer was and they.</v>

5421
02:28:10.110 --> 02:28:10.980
<v Speaker 6>When AIDS came along,</v>

5422
02:28:10.981 --> 02:28:11.551
<v Speaker 6>they're like liquid,</v>

5423
02:28:11.551 --> 02:28:12.211
<v Speaker 6>just fucking throw,</v>

5424
02:28:12.211 --> 02:28:13.700
<v Speaker 6>act out and we got a bunch of this shit.</v>

5425
02:28:13.750 --> 02:28:14.583
<v Speaker 6>Got An infection.</v>

5426
02:28:14.600 --> 02:28:15.433
<v Speaker 2>So what was,</v>

5427
02:28:15.560 --> 02:28:17.540
<v Speaker 2>what was behind them wanting to use this shit?</v>

5428
02:28:17.840 --> 02:28:22.130
<v Speaker 2>They would make money though the movie goes into great detail it and the movie</v>

5429
02:28:22.130 --> 02:28:23.360
<v Speaker 6>actually has a disclaimer at the end.</v>

5430
02:28:23.361 --> 02:28:24.260
<v Speaker 6>It's quite fascinating.</v>

5431
02:28:24.730 --> 02:28:28.780
<v Speaker 6>They talked about the cocktails were act was used in a lower dose and helped</v>

5432
02:28:28.781 --> 02:28:29.660
<v Speaker 6>save lives.</v>

5433
02:28:29.920 --> 02:28:30.291
<v Speaker 6>Like I said,</v>

5434
02:28:30.291 --> 02:28:30.950
<v Speaker 6>it just like as a,</v>

5435
02:28:30.950 --> 02:28:31.820
<v Speaker 6>as an aside,</v>

5436
02:28:32.060 --> 02:28:33.380
<v Speaker 6>at the end of the movie in print,</v>

5437
02:28:33.590 --> 02:28:34.000
<v Speaker 6>again,</v>

5438
02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:35.240
<v Speaker 6>we got to say that so we don't get sued,</v>

5439
02:28:35.690 --> 02:28:36.060
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>

5440
02:28:36.060 --> 02:28:36.740
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>

5441
02:28:36.740 --> 02:28:40.820
<v Speaker 6>But the reality of act is act as toxic as fuck.</v>

5442
02:28:41.510 --> 02:28:46.510
<v Speaker 6>And Matthew mcconaughey's character gets aids and they put them on act is about</v>

5443
02:28:46.761 --> 02:28:51.761
<v Speaker 6>to die and then he starts eating healthy and going to this guy in Mexico who's</v>

5444
02:28:51.980 --> 02:28:54.440
<v Speaker 6>been kicked out of the United States practicing alternative medicine.</v>

5445
02:28:54.680 --> 02:28:55.513
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to tell you anymore,</v>

5446
02:28:55.610 --> 02:28:56.570
<v Speaker 6>spoiler alert,</v>

5447
02:28:57.350 --> 02:28:58.183
<v Speaker 6>but uh,</v>

5448
02:28:58.310 --> 02:28:59.210
<v Speaker 6>it's pretty interesting,</v>

5449
02:28:59.570 --> 02:29:00.403
<v Speaker 6>but it's,</v>

5450
02:29:00.620 --> 02:29:01.401
<v Speaker 6>it's the same thing.</v>

5451
02:29:01.401 --> 02:29:02.200
<v Speaker 6>It's all about.</v>

5452
02:29:02.200 --> 02:29:02.800
<v Speaker 6>You just said,</v>

5453
02:29:02.800 --> 02:29:03.633
<v Speaker 6>of course he did.</v>

5454
02:29:03.740 --> 02:29:05.510
<v Speaker 6>Is Twelve going on 12?</v>

5455
02:29:06.180 --> 02:29:06.970
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

5456
02:29:06.970 --> 02:29:07.910
<v Speaker 6>I mean it's the same thing.</v>

5457
02:29:07.911 --> 02:29:08.990
<v Speaker 6>It's just people making money.</v>

5458
02:29:09.180 --> 02:29:10.820
<v Speaker 6>It's just people making money off a drug that kills me.</v>

5459
02:29:11.090 --> 02:29:11.923
<v Speaker 6>They don't care.</v>

5460
02:29:12.480 --> 02:29:12.621
<v Speaker 6>They're,</v>

5461
02:29:12.621 --> 02:29:13.700
<v Speaker 6>the movie goes into really,</v>

5462
02:29:13.930 --> 02:29:14.121
<v Speaker 6>really.</v>

5463
02:29:14.121 --> 02:29:18.140
<v Speaker 6>They do a really good job of painting how the decisions were made and it's</v>

5464
02:29:18.141 --> 02:29:18.980
<v Speaker 6>interesting stuff.</v>

5465
02:29:19.940 --> 02:29:20.480
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

5466
02:29:20.480 --> 02:29:21.380
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's the thing.</v>

5467
02:29:21.381 --> 02:29:22.220
<v Speaker 5>When there's money behind it,</v>

5468
02:29:22.410 --> 02:29:23.720
<v Speaker 5>tilted the craziest shit.</v>

5469
02:29:23.840 --> 02:29:24.770
<v Speaker 5>Craziest shit.</v>

5470
02:29:24.860 --> 02:29:25.730
<v Speaker 5>Do you have hope,</v>

5471
02:29:25.880 --> 02:29:27.200
<v Speaker 5>Lee camp for the human race too?</v>

5472
02:29:27.201 --> 02:29:27.501
<v Speaker 5>I have.</v>

5473
02:29:27.501 --> 02:29:28.260
<v Speaker 5>Hope,</v>

5474
02:29:28.260 --> 02:29:29.093
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

5475
02:29:30.260 --> 02:29:31.410
<v Speaker 5>I think it could go one of two ways.</v>

5476
02:29:31.630 --> 02:29:32.451
<v Speaker 5>I think we could,</v>

5477
02:29:32.451 --> 02:29:32.840
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

5478
02:29:32.840 --> 02:29:33.620
<v Speaker 5>we could,</v>

5479
02:29:33.620 --> 02:29:34.200
<v Speaker 5>we're,</v>

5480
02:29:34.200 --> 02:29:39.200
<v Speaker 5>we're going down a really ugly path right now where things like the corporations</v>

5481
02:29:39.681 --> 02:29:40.060
<v Speaker 5>are,</v>

5482
02:29:40.060 --> 02:29:40.530
<v Speaker 5>are,</v>

5483
02:29:40.530 --> 02:29:45.110
<v Speaker 5>are taking over the decisions that are being made globally and you know,</v>

5484
02:29:45.111 --> 02:29:46.730
<v Speaker 5>things like the Trans Pacific partnership,</v>

5485
02:29:46.731 --> 02:29:50.300
<v Speaker 5>which is the largest trade deal mankind's ever seen and basically seeds the</v>

5486
02:29:50.301 --> 02:29:53.600
<v Speaker 5>sovereignty of our country to corporations and it's being pushed forward right</v>

5487
02:29:53.601 --> 02:29:54.290
<v Speaker 5>now.</v>

5488
02:29:54.290 --> 02:29:55.580
<v Speaker 5>And so it has that past.</v>

5489
02:29:55.670 --> 02:29:56.660
<v Speaker 5>It has not passed yet,</v>

5490
02:29:56.661 --> 02:29:58.940
<v Speaker 5>but Obama is trying very hard to make a pass.</v>

5491
02:29:59.000 --> 02:29:59.833
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

5492
02:29:59.870 --> 02:30:00.231
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

5493
02:30:00.231 --> 02:30:00.650
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

5494
02:30:00.650 --> 02:30:04.070
<v Speaker 5>it's being decided by 600 corporate lobbyists and uh,</v>

5495
02:30:04.140 --> 02:30:04.890
<v Speaker 5>and not.</v>

5496
02:30:04.890 --> 02:30:06.590
<v Speaker 5>They're not allowing the wiki leaks,</v>

5497
02:30:06.591 --> 02:30:06.831
<v Speaker 5>leaks,</v>

5498
02:30:06.831 --> 02:30:07.370
<v Speaker 5>some of it.</v>

5499
02:30:07.370 --> 02:30:08.600
<v Speaker 5>And it's pretty horrible.</v>

5500
02:30:08.810 --> 02:30:09.260
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

5501
02:30:09.260 --> 02:30:12.560
<v Speaker 5>it basically says that if a corporation can't do something here because of</v>

5502
02:30:12.561 --> 02:30:14.180
<v Speaker 5>environmental laws or whatever laws,</v>

5503
02:30:14.210 --> 02:30:18.260
<v Speaker 5>they can then sue us in an international tribunal to get their profits.</v>

5504
02:30:18.800 --> 02:30:19.161
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

5505
02:30:19.161 --> 02:30:19.880
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

5506
02:30:19.880 --> 02:30:21.920
<v Speaker 5>and I think that if we keep going down that path,</v>

5507
02:30:21.950 --> 02:30:23.390
<v Speaker 5>it's going to be very ugly.</v>

5508
02:30:23.420 --> 02:30:24.830
<v Speaker 5>But I think that people are waking up.</v>

5509
02:30:25.310 --> 02:30:26.180
<v Speaker 6>What can they do though,</v>

5510
02:30:26.240 --> 02:30:27.350
<v Speaker 6>if they really are waking up,</v>

5511
02:30:27.440 --> 02:30:29.000
<v Speaker 6>what do you think could be done?</v>

5512
02:30:29.001 --> 02:30:30.350
<v Speaker 6>Like if you had to look at the big picture,</v>

5513
02:30:30.351 --> 02:30:35.351
<v Speaker 6>if you look at like the society that we've sort of found ourselves in today in</v>

5514
02:30:35.661 --> 02:30:36.590
<v Speaker 6>2013,</v>

5515
02:30:36.591 --> 02:30:38.210
<v Speaker 6>you sort of extrapolate from there 30,</v>

5516
02:30:38.211 --> 02:30:39.470
<v Speaker 6>40 years in the future.</v>

5517
02:30:39.890 --> 02:30:41.060
<v Speaker 6>How do you see it all working out?</v>

5518
02:30:42.170 --> 02:30:43.580
<v Speaker 5>I mean to make it work out,</v>

5519
02:30:43.581 --> 02:30:44.780
<v Speaker 5>we've got a start.</v>

5520
02:30:45.320 --> 02:30:47.780
<v Speaker 5>I think we've got to start living differently.</v>

5521
02:30:47.781 --> 02:30:48.371
<v Speaker 5>I mean if,</v>

5522
02:30:48.371 --> 02:30:51.290
<v Speaker 5>if every country would he use resources the way America does?</v>

5523
02:30:51.291 --> 02:30:51.771
<v Speaker 5>We needed,</v>

5524
02:30:51.771 --> 02:30:52.521
<v Speaker 5>what were the numbers?</v>

5525
02:30:52.521 --> 02:30:52.851
<v Speaker 5>Three,</v>

5526
02:30:52.851 --> 02:30:53.181
<v Speaker 5>five,</v>

5527
02:30:53.181 --> 02:30:53.420
<v Speaker 5>earth,</v>

5528
02:30:53.420 --> 02:30:55.070
<v Speaker 5>something like that to be able to sustain it.</v>

5529
02:30:56.090 --> 02:30:59.220
<v Speaker 5>It's we live in an absolutely unsustainable model and,</v>

5530
02:30:59.300 --> 02:30:59.811
<v Speaker 5>and you know,</v>

5531
02:30:59.811 --> 02:31:02.210
<v Speaker 5>maybe the party will go on for a few more years,</v>

5532
02:31:02.211 --> 02:31:03.470
<v Speaker 5>but eventually it's got to end.</v>

5533
02:31:03.471 --> 02:31:08.471
<v Speaker 5>And so I think we do have to change the way we live in a pretty severe sense</v>

5534
02:31:09.261 --> 02:31:09.501
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

5535
02:31:09.501 --> 02:31:10.310
<v Speaker 5>and it's,</v>

5536
02:31:10.310 --> 02:31:13.490
<v Speaker 5>and it's being thrown into our face as we see every day.</v>

5537
02:31:13.491 --> 02:31:13.811
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

5538
02:31:13.811 --> 02:31:15.290
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck.</v>

5612
02:33:08.680 --> 02:33:09.700

<v Speaker 6>So he's talking about Columbus.</v>

5614
02:33:11.051 --> 02:33:15.540
<v Speaker 6>It's like one of the best descriptions of how fucked up that those people were.</v>

5615
02:33:15.720 --> 02:33:16.090
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

5616
02:33:16.090 --> 02:33:18.040
<v Speaker 6>The scene of them landing,</v>

5617
02:33:18.380 --> 02:33:18.760
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5618
02:33:18.760 --> 02:33:22.560
<v Speaker 6>in these places where these people had never seen people like that before and,</v>

5619
02:33:22.960 --> 02:33:24.210
<v Speaker 5>and also in the diaries,</v>

5620
02:33:24.360 --> 02:33:24.790
<v Speaker 5>he's like,</v>

5621
02:33:24.790 --> 02:33:26.200
<v Speaker 5>it's amazing how generous they are.</v>

5622
02:33:26.201 --> 02:33:28.270
<v Speaker 5>They just walked up and wanted to be friendly or whatever,</v>

5623
02:33:28.271 --> 02:33:29.990
<v Speaker 5>and then when they don't bring enough gold,</v>

5624
02:33:29.991 --> 02:33:30.290
<v Speaker 5>he fucking.</v>

5625
02:33:30.290 --> 02:33:30.410
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

5626
02:33:30.410 --> 02:33:31.200
<v Speaker 6>chops their heads off.</v>

5627
02:33:31.200 --> 02:33:31.351
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

5628
02:33:31.351 --> 02:33:36.351
<v Speaker 6>They were all like psychedelic people taken Iowasca and living off the land and</v>

5629
02:33:36.980 --> 02:33:37.561
<v Speaker 6>he's crazy.</v>

5630
02:33:37.561 --> 02:33:39.960
<v Speaker 6>Assholes came by boat starving to death.</v>

5631
02:33:40.280 --> 02:33:45.280
<v Speaker 6>He was raping this thing that I'm listening to about a world war one.</v>

5632
02:33:45.570 --> 02:33:49.140
<v Speaker 6>It's really hard to wrap your head around these atrocities taking place today</v>

5633
02:33:49.560 --> 02:33:52.130
<v Speaker 6>because that what the Germans did to the Belgiums let me see.</v>

5634
02:33:52.131 --> 02:33:53.100
<v Speaker 6>It's like really crazy,</v>

5635
02:33:53.101 --> 02:33:58.101
<v Speaker 6>like getting his type shit and the idea that that's the only 100 years ago and</v>

5636
02:33:58.530 --> 02:33:59.161
<v Speaker 6>that's the same.</v>

5637
02:33:59.161 --> 02:34:02.460
<v Speaker 6>The same animals who would call themselves people today existed.</v>

5638
02:34:02.461 --> 02:34:04.380
<v Speaker 6>Then like the form of us and them.</v>

5639
02:34:04.381 --> 02:34:05.280
<v Speaker 6>They're the same.</v>

5640
02:34:05.640 --> 02:34:06.660
<v Speaker 6>There's no difference.</v>

5641
02:34:06.780 --> 02:34:09.840
<v Speaker 6>Maybe we have better nutrition so people like they get bigger,</v>

5642
02:34:10.230 --> 02:34:11.063
<v Speaker 6>but other than that,</v>

5643
02:34:12.530 --> 02:34:13.363
<v Speaker 6>taller,</v>

5646
02:34:17.020 --> 02:34:18.100

02:35:50.160 --> 02:35:51.360
<v Speaker 4>That doesn't mean five and a half.</v>

5722
02:35:51.420 --> 02:35:53.360
<v Speaker 4>Five and one slash two inches long by 45.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Eight,</v>

02:35:59.970 --> 02:36:02.250
<v Speaker 4>What does that fuck is that?</v>

5729
02:36:02.251 --> 02:36:04.350
<v Speaker 4>Why would you give me that as Siri?</v>

5730
02:36:04.610 --> 02:36:05.140
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

5731
02:36:05.140 --> 02:36:06.130

02:36:07.201 --> 02:36:08.580
<v Speaker 4>five feet tall.</v>

5734
02:36:08.980 --> 02:36:09.813
<v Speaker 4>That's weird.</v>

5735
02:36:10.470 --> 02:36:10.771
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

5736
02:36:10.771 --> 02:36:11.730
<v Speaker 4>This website sucks.</v>

5737
02:36:11.940 --> 02:36:12.090
<v Speaker 4>Alright,</v>

5738
02:36:12.090 --> 02:36:13.410
<v Speaker 4>let's go on wikipedia.</v>

5739
02:36:13.740 --> 02:36:14.071
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

5740
02:36:14.071 --> 02:36:15.240
<v Speaker 4>His height was actually.</v>

5741
02:36:15.241 --> 02:36:15.600
<v Speaker 4>Here we go.</v>

5742
02:36:15.600 --> 02:36:15.960
<v Speaker 4>I was.</v>

5743
02:36:15.960 --> 02:36:17.730
<v Speaker 4>How tall was an important napoleon?</v>

5744
02:36:21.810 --> 02:36:22.130
<v Speaker 4>Huh?</v>

5745
02:36:22.130 --> 02:36:22.963
<v Speaker 4>Listen to this.</v>

5746
02:36:23.020 --> 02:36:26.770
<v Speaker 4>The British propaganda of the time promoted the idea that Napoleon was short.</v>

5747
02:36:26.800 --> 02:36:27.521
<v Speaker 4>In reality,</v>

5748
02:36:27.521 --> 02:36:29.710
<v Speaker 4>his height was above average for the period.</v>

5749
02:36:30.700 --> 02:36:32.260
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

5750
02:36:32.290 --> 02:36:33.610
<v Speaker 4>That is really.</v>

5751
02:36:33.611 --> 02:36:34.750
<v Speaker 4>And through history.</v>

5752
02:36:34.870 --> 02:36:36.130
<v Speaker 4>That's exactly what we were talking about.</v>

5753
02:36:36.131 --> 02:36:39.550
<v Speaker 4>The stories of now suggests than polling was five foot six,</v>

5754
02:36:40.270 --> 02:36:41.650
<v Speaker 4>which was often seen.</v>

5755
02:36:41.890 --> 02:36:42.101
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

5756
02:36:42.101 --> 02:36:43.090
<v Speaker 4>That's really interesting.</v>

5757
02:36:44.290 --> 02:36:45.610
<v Speaker 4>That's not that show for back then.</v>

5758
02:36:46.750 --> 02:36:46.961
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5759
02:36:46.961 --> 02:36:49.930
<v Speaker 4>It says Napoleon was often seen with his imperial guard,</v>

5760
02:36:49.960 --> 02:36:53.620
<v Speaker 4>which also contributed to the perception of his being short because the imperial</v>

5761
02:36:53.621 --> 02:36:56.620
<v Speaker 4>guards were above average height and psychology.</v>

5762
02:36:56.621 --> 02:37:00.370
<v Speaker 4>The Napoleon complex is regarded as a derogatory social stereotype.</v>

5763
02:37:00.790 --> 02:37:01.451
<v Speaker 4>That is interesting.</v>

5764
02:37:01.451 --> 02:37:03.040
<v Speaker 4>So in reality,</v>

5765
02:37:03.070 --> 02:37:05.350
<v Speaker 4>Napoleon was taller than the average person at the time.</v>

5766
02:37:05.510 --> 02:37:06.430
<v Speaker 4>They were just learned it here.</v>

5767
02:37:06.431 --> 02:37:07.600
<v Speaker 4>First folks,</v>

5768
02:37:07.830 --> 02:37:09.190
<v Speaker 4>and we learned it because the Internet,</v>

5769
02:37:09.880 --> 02:37:10.480
<v Speaker 4>Lee camp,</v>

5770

<v Speaker 4>see you soon.</v>

5771
02:37:10.991 --> 02:37:15.010
<v Speaker 4>That'll be wired into our minds and we will just think it and then everybody</v>

5772
02:37:15.050 --> 02:37:15.890
<v Speaker 4>will be an annoying</v>

5773
02:37:16.220 --> 02:37:18.760
<v Speaker 2>that has all the answers and you'll.</v>

5774
02:37:18.800 --> 02:37:20.380
<v Speaker 2>They'll tell you something like all self righteously,</v>

5775
02:37:20.381 --> 02:37:20.750
<v Speaker 2>and you'd be like,</v>

5776
02:37:20.750 --> 02:37:21.670
<v Speaker 2>I know that too.</v>

5777
02:37:22.070 --> 02:37:22.640
<v Speaker 2>Duh.</v>

5778
02:37:22.640 --> 02:37:23.900
<v Speaker 2>Everyone knows everything I do.</v>

5779
02:37:24.480 --> 02:37:24.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5780
02:37:24.700 --> 02:37:25.221
<v Speaker 2>That will help.</v>

5781
02:37:25.221 --> 02:37:25.401
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

5782
02:37:25.401 --> 02:37:26.450
<v Speaker 2>When everybody knows everything,</v>

5783
02:37:27.110 --> 02:37:30.240
<v Speaker 2>we can't know if everyone knows every.</v>

5784
02:37:30.250 --> 02:37:31.310
<v Speaker 2>There'd be no grandstanding.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Be Equally Vapid.</v>

5787
02:37:35.190 --> 02:37:37.280
<v Speaker 2>We're also going to be able to tell when anyone's lying.</v>

5788
02:37:37.281 --> 02:37:39.110
<v Speaker 2>We're going to know everything about everything,</v>

5789
02:37:39.111 --> 02:37:40.460
<v Speaker 2>so there's not any secrets.</v>

5790
02:37:40.461 --> 02:37:40.940
<v Speaker 2>It's awesome.</v>

5791
02:37:40.940 --> 02:37:41.810
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be weird.</v>

5792
02:37:41.811 --> 02:37:42.550
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be.</v>

5793
02:37:42.550 --> 02:37:47.110
<v Speaker 2>There'll be a brain scan for lying pretty soon because we want to be on ecstasy</v>

5794
02:37:47.120 --> 02:37:47.660

<v Speaker 2>Everyone knows everything,</v>

5799
02:37:53.871 --> 02:37:54.704
<v Speaker 2>but no one cares.</v>

02:37:54.920 --> 02:37:56.120
<v Speaker 2>Everyone knows everything about everybody,</v>

02:38:21.070 --> 02:38:22.610
<v Speaker 2>a lot of cool things happen out here.</v>

5828
02:38:23.180 --> 02:38:23.660
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

5829
02:38:23.660 --> 02:38:24.740
<v Speaker 2>he did a great job with the Ice House.</v>

5830
02:38:24.741 --> 02:38:25.730
<v Speaker 2>That was really funny stuff.</v>

5831
02:38:26.300 --> 02:38:27.041
<v Speaker 2>Funny stuff that,</v>

5832
02:38:27.041 --> 02:38:28.490
<v Speaker 2>that crowd is the greatest crowd on earth.</v>

5833
02:38:28.730 --> 02:38:29.480
<v Speaker 2>Smart.</v>

5834
02:38:29.480 --> 02:38:30.313
<v Speaker 2>They don't get any better.</v>

5835
02:38:30.510 --> 02:38:31.640
<v Speaker 2>It just really doesn't get any better.</v>

5836
02:38:32.360 --> 02:38:34.460
<v Speaker 2>So it's a club from the 1960.</v>

5837
02:38:34.850 --> 02:38:36.110
<v Speaker 2>It spoils you when you,</v>

5838
02:38:36.111 --> 02:38:39.110
<v Speaker 2>when you get to deal with smart crowds because then you've played the</v>

5839
02:38:39.230 --> 02:38:41.870
<v Speaker 2>neanderthals at a regular club and yeah.</v>

5840
02:38:41.871 --> 02:38:42.471
<v Speaker 2>But again,</v>

5841
02:38:42.471 --> 02:38:43.310
<v Speaker 2>the Yin and the Yang,</v>

5842
02:38:43.370 --> 02:38:44.330
<v Speaker 2>it makes you appreciate those.</v>

5843
02:38:45.560 --> 02:38:48.570
<v Speaker 2>I think you should always have a shitty fucking show every now and then just so</v>

5844
02:38:48.580 --> 02:38:49.700
<v Speaker 2>you appreciate the good ones.</v>

5845
02:38:50.200 --> 02:38:51.320
<v Speaker 2>A bunch of dumb people.</v>

5846
02:38:51.610 --> 02:38:55.910
<v Speaker 2>You should probably schedule shows and places you suck just so they could really</v>

5847
02:38:55.911 --> 02:38:56.481
<v Speaker 2>appreciate,</v>

5848
02:38:56.481 --> 02:38:57.130
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

5849
02:38:57.130 --> 02:38:57.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5850
02:38:57.350 --> 02:38:58.910
<v Speaker 2>Austin somewhere cool.</v>

5851
02:39:00.170 --> 02:39:00.890
<v Speaker 2>Chicago,</v>

5852
02:39:00.890 --> 02:39:01.723
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5853
02:39:01.940 --> 02:39:03.940
<v Speaker 2>scheduled places that are just fucking fill with.</v>

5854
02:39:04.170 --> 02:39:08.680
<v Speaker 2>You're going to get some emails from the places that aren't those cities in</v>

5855
02:39:09.080 --> 02:39:11.750
<v Speaker 2>fucking Weirdos identifying with a certain patch of dirt.</v>

5856
02:39:14.760 --> 02:39:16.150
<v Speaker 2>There's some cool people</v>

5857
02:39:19.340 --> 02:39:20.350
<v Speaker 2>if people want to find out,</v>

5858
02:39:20.351 --> 02:39:22.030
<v Speaker 2>but you're standing up there to catch you somewhere.</v>

5859
02:39:22.040 --> 02:39:23.780
<v Speaker 2>Where's the best way to get ahold of you?</v>

5860
02:39:23.840 --> 02:39:25.400
<v Speaker 2>Elite camp.net.</v>

5861
02:39:25.401 --> 02:39:28.640
<v Speaker 2>And then the twitters at Lake Camp and the facebook is Lee camp,</v>

5862
02:39:28.641 --> 02:39:31.520
<v Speaker 2>comedian and [inaudible] dot com.</v>

5863
02:39:32.260 --> 02:39:32.511
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

5864
02:39:32.511 --> 02:39:32.781
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

5865
02:39:32.781 --> 02:39:33.201
<v Speaker 2>They used to be.</v>

5866
02:39:33.201 --> 02:39:34.340
<v Speaker 2>It used to be very important site.</v>

5867
02:39:34.570 --> 02:39:35.403
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

5868
02:39:35.600 --> 02:39:36.760
<v Speaker 2>if they can't,</v>

5869
02:39:38.400 --> 02:39:40.370
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea what it means.</v>

5870
02:39:40.610 --> 02:39:42.500
<v Speaker 2>Camp Lee camp makes sense.</v>

5871
02:39:42.590 --> 02:39:44.540
<v Speaker 2>I always figured I might go over there one day and they'd be like,</v>

5872
02:39:44.541 --> 02:39:44.721
<v Speaker 2>hi,</v>

5873
02:39:44.721 --> 02:39:45.291
<v Speaker 2>I'm Lee camp.</v>

5874
02:39:45.291 --> 02:39:45.651
<v Speaker 2>And they're like,</v>

5875
02:39:45.651 --> 02:39:47.090
<v Speaker 2>that's not legal.</v>

5876
02:39:49.640 --> 02:39:50.770
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe you.</v>

5877
02:39:51.180 --> 02:39:51.980
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

5878
02:39:51.980 --> 02:39:52.640
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

5879
02:39:52.640 --> 02:39:54.590
<v Speaker 2>now I do those videos twice a week.</v>

5880
02:39:54.860 --> 02:39:55.580
<v Speaker 2>Twice a week.</v>

5881
02:39:55.580 --> 02:39:56.413
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5882
02:39:56.780 --> 02:39:57.530
<v Speaker 2>You're committed.</v>

5883
02:39:57.530 --> 02:39:58.310
<v Speaker 2>I am committed.</v>

5884
02:39:58.310 --> 02:39:58.940
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

5885
02:39:58.940 --> 02:40:00.410
<v Speaker 2>One hundred 80 episodes out there.</v>

5886
02:40:00.470 --> 02:40:02.600
<v Speaker 2>Do you ever find yourself just to talk about today?</v>

5887
02:40:02.601 --> 02:40:03.770
<v Speaker 2>So it's not.</v>

5888
02:40:03.771 --> 02:40:04.510
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing to talk about.</v>

5889
02:40:04.510 --> 02:40:04.761
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

5890
02:40:04.761 --> 02:40:06.350
<v Speaker 2>I don't always know how to make a funny size.</v>

5891
02:40:06.390 --> 02:40:07.520
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking depressing.</v>

5892
02:40:08.150 --> 02:40:08.571
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5893
02:40:08.571 --> 02:40:09.291
<v Speaker 2>So everything.</v>

5894
02:40:09.291 --> 02:40:10.940
<v Speaker 2>So is that like the theme,</v>

5895
02:40:10.941 --> 02:40:13.470
<v Speaker 2>everything has to sort of have a meaning to it.</v>

5896
02:40:13.490 --> 02:40:15.810
<v Speaker 2>You've got to be pointing something out and try to make it funny.</v>

5897
02:40:16.170 --> 02:40:16.471
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5898
02:40:16.471 --> 02:40:18.720
<v Speaker 2>Most of the time I stick to pretty important topics.</v>

5899
02:40:18.750 --> 02:40:20.010
<v Speaker 2>I will occasionally have some fun,</v>

5900
02:40:20.011 --> 02:40:21.240
<v Speaker 2>like with the Amazon drones,</v>

5901
02:40:21.680 --> 02:40:22.080
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5902
02:40:22.080 --> 02:40:22.710
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

5903
02:40:22.710 --> 02:40:24.210
<v Speaker 2>that's less important topic,</v>

5904
02:40:24.211 --> 02:40:28.740
<v Speaker 2>but most of it's a pretty crucial stuff going on in the world to Amazon drones.</v>

5905
02:40:30.570 --> 02:40:31.920
<v Speaker 2>One day we're going to look back.</v>

5906
02:40:32.820 --> 02:40:34.050
<v Speaker 2>If people haven't watched that video,</v>

5907
02:40:34.051 --> 02:40:34.770
<v Speaker 2>they should watch it.</v>

5908
02:40:34.770 --> 02:40:38.070
<v Speaker 2>It's weird that we've shown it on the podcast for the Amazon drone dropping</v>

5909
02:40:38.071 --> 02:40:38.880
<v Speaker 2>packages off.</v>

5910
02:40:38.880 --> 02:40:39.421
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people,</v>

5911
02:40:39.421 --> 02:40:42.090
<v Speaker 2>like the actual science people thought that they were trolling,</v>

5912
02:40:42.330 --> 02:40:45.930
<v Speaker 2>they were just trying to get a lot of attention for the possibilities of the</v>

5913
02:40:45.931 --> 02:40:46.240
<v Speaker 2>future.</v>

5914
02:40:46.240 --> 02:40:50.730
<v Speaker 2>Like in no way shape or form actually preparing to use drones to drop packages</v>

5915
02:40:50.731 --> 02:40:50.940
<v Speaker 2>off.</v>

5916
02:40:50.940 --> 02:40:52.080
<v Speaker 2>Like that's interesting.</v>

5917
02:40:52.081 --> 02:40:56.430
<v Speaker 2>I think the key would be what the flight patterns like are they running into</v>

5918
02:40:56.431 --> 02:40:59.040
<v Speaker 2>planes and power lines and I think they're really low.</v>

5919
02:40:59.070 --> 02:41:01.260
<v Speaker 2>I think they only go like above buildings and shit,</v>

5920
02:41:01.290 --> 02:41:02.610
<v Speaker 2>which makes them easy to shoot down.</v>

5921
02:41:03.430 --> 02:41:07.080
<v Speaker 2>We were saying is that someone's going to shoot your package happen if you're</v>

5922
02:41:07.081 --> 02:41:08.130
<v Speaker 2>delivering some fucking.</v>

5923
02:41:08.131 --> 02:41:11.190
<v Speaker 2>It's something shooting with prizes.</v>

5924
02:41:12.290 --> 02:41:12.561
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5925
02:41:12.561 --> 02:41:13.590
<v Speaker 2>You just make them blow up.</v>

5926
02:41:14.250 --> 02:41:14.551
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile,</v>

5927
02:41:14.551 --> 02:41:17.790
<v Speaker 2>they'll have 360 degree cameras everywhere to prevent that because Amazon wants</v>

5928
02:41:17.791 --> 02:41:22.140
<v Speaker 2>to secure the safety of their drones and I'm sure if your privacy will have no</v>

5929
02:41:22.141 --> 02:41:24.730
<v Speaker 2>interest in the thousands of cameras flying around our neighborhood.</v>

5930
02:41:25.010 --> 02:41:25.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5931
02:41:25.310 --> 02:41:25.551
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

5932
02:41:25.551 --> 02:41:25.771
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

5933
02:41:25.771 --> 02:41:27.810
<v Speaker 2>They won't hack those at all.</v>

5934
02:41:28.260 --> 02:41:30.630
<v Speaker 6>They're going to realize from this that people need their freedom,</v>

5935
02:41:30.950 --> 02:41:31.681
<v Speaker 6>need this space,</v>

5936
02:41:31.681 --> 02:41:32.580
<v Speaker 6>and they're gonna they're gonna.</v>

5937
02:41:32.581 --> 02:41:33.120
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

5938
02:41:33.120 --> 02:41:34.140
<v Speaker 6>they're going to give us that.</v>

5939
02:41:34.230 --> 02:41:35.063
<v Speaker 6>They're going to</v>

5940
02:41:35.840 --> 02:41:37.510
<v Speaker 2>take an agreed this is the positive jail.</v>

5941
02:41:37.830 --> 02:41:38.041
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5942
02:41:38.041 --> 02:41:38.311
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

5943
02:41:38.311 --> 02:41:38.851
<v Speaker 2>this is what I do.</v>

5944
02:41:38.851 --> 02:41:39.391
<v Speaker 2>When I in the shot,</v>

5945
02:41:39.391 --> 02:41:40.650
<v Speaker 2>I tried to end it on a good note.</v>

5946
02:41:41.010 --> 02:41:44.940
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to say Amazon's going to realize that the NSA and all these,</v>

5947
02:41:45.610 --> 02:41:46.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5948
02:41:46.230 --> 02:41:47.820
<v Speaker 2>you need to understand the folly of their ways.</v>

5949
02:41:47.970 --> 02:41:49.420
<v Speaker 2>I think people are slowly waking up,</v>

5950
02:41:49.430 --> 02:41:50.030
<v Speaker 2>but I do.</v>

5951
02:41:50.030 --> 02:41:50.910
<v Speaker 2>I'm positive.</v>

5952
02:41:50.911 --> 02:41:52.880
<v Speaker 2>I consider myself a cynical optimist.</v>

5953
02:41:52.890 --> 02:41:54.450
<v Speaker 2>I view the glass is half full of Shit.</v>

5954
02:41:56.380 --> 02:41:56.931
<v Speaker 6>That's a good one.</v>

5955
02:41:56.931 --> 02:41:57.764
<v Speaker 6>I like that.</v>

5956
02:41:58.130 --> 02:41:58.910
<v Speaker 6>I agree with you,</v>

5957
02:41:58.910 --> 02:41:59.600
<v Speaker 6>I think,</v>

5958
02:41:59.600 --> 02:42:00.470
<v Speaker 6>I think it also,</v>

5959
02:42:00.530 --> 02:42:02.330
<v Speaker 6>it could go both ways for sure,</v>

5960
02:42:02.331 --> 02:42:06.650
<v Speaker 6>but right now the possibilities I think are leaning towards what you're saying</v>

5961
02:42:06.680 --> 02:42:07.820
<v Speaker 6>that people are waking up.</v>

5962
02:42:07.980 --> 02:42:08.813
<v Speaker 6>People are,</v>

5963
02:42:08.910 --> 02:42:09.743
<v Speaker 6>it just takes awhile.</v>

5964
02:42:09.860 --> 02:42:14.060
<v Speaker 6>I mean if you look back at what this hardcore history podcast about the world</v>

5965
02:42:14.061 --> 02:42:16.120
<v Speaker 6>war one and how brutal the,</v>

5966
02:42:16.130 --> 02:42:16.230
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

5967
02:42:16.230 --> 02:42:18.160
<v Speaker 6>the Germans were to the Belgiums and how,</v>

5968
02:42:18.250 --> 02:42:18.800
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5969
02:42:18.800 --> 02:42:22.430
<v Speaker 6>that wasn't that long ago and you think of how relatively safe the world is</v>

5970
02:42:22.431 --> 02:42:22.731
<v Speaker 6>today,</v>

5971
02:42:22.731 --> 02:42:23.980
<v Speaker 6>unless you were in Pakistan,</v>

5972
02:42:23.990 --> 02:42:25.300
<v Speaker 6>you get hit by a drone or less.</v>

5973
02:42:25.301 --> 02:42:29.240
<v Speaker 6>You're in Afghanistan or a few like severe hot spots in the world.</v>

5974
02:42:30.070 --> 02:42:31.430
<v Speaker 6>It's a lot of fucking safety.</v>

5975
02:42:31.490 --> 02:42:32.210
<v Speaker 6>There's a lot of,</v>

5976
02:42:32.210 --> 02:42:34.210
<v Speaker 6>there's a lot more safety now than it's ever been before.</v>

5977
02:42:34.220 --> 02:42:36.320
<v Speaker 6>It's a lot more civility now than it's ever been before.</v>

5978
02:42:36.380 --> 02:42:38.450
<v Speaker 6>And all of the bullshit,</v>

5979
02:42:38.750 --> 02:42:40.040
<v Speaker 6>all the war and all the,</v>

5980
02:42:40.100 --> 02:42:44.390
<v Speaker 6>it has to be done like under an air of fuckery because if you just come out with</v>

5981
02:42:44.720 --> 02:42:46.850
<v Speaker 6>the idea of imperialism is not gonna be accepted anymore.</v>

5982
02:42:46.851 --> 02:42:48.050
<v Speaker 6>You can't just say like,</v>

5983
02:42:48.051 --> 02:42:49.940
<v Speaker 6>the Germans say we're going to take Belgium now.</v>

5984
02:42:49.990 --> 02:42:51.170
<v Speaker 6>Like America would go,</v>

5985
02:42:51.171 --> 02:42:51.321
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

5986
02:42:51.321 --> 02:42:51.711
<v Speaker 6>why?</v>

5987
02:42:51.711 --> 02:42:53.030
<v Speaker 6>Why would you go into Belgium?</v>

5988
02:42:53.031 --> 02:42:54.380
<v Speaker 6>They didn't do anything to anybody.</v>

5989
02:42:54.390 --> 02:42:55.670
<v Speaker 6>They barely have an army.</v>

5990
02:42:55.671 --> 02:42:55.821
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

5991
02:42:55.821 --> 02:42:56.810
<v Speaker 6>what the fuck are you doing?</v>

5992
02:42:56.970 --> 02:42:58.250
<v Speaker 6>We wouldn't stand for it.</v>

5993
02:42:58.490 --> 02:42:58.671
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

5994
02:42:58.671 --> 02:43:00.530
<v Speaker 6>we're going to go through Belgium because we want to get to France.</v>

5995
02:43:00.710 --> 02:43:01.543
<v Speaker 6>You can't do that.</v>

5996
02:43:01.810 --> 02:43:04.330
<v Speaker 2>Also news get news gets around the world much quicker.</v>

5997
02:43:04.331 --> 02:43:07.210
<v Speaker 2>It used to be if you wanted to say somebody did something in that attack them,</v>

5998
02:43:07.211 --> 02:43:09.070
<v Speaker 2>you could do it and no one could prove otherwise.</v>

5999
02:43:09.071 --> 02:43:13.840
<v Speaker 2>Whereas now their cell phone cameras in frequent Syria showing you what's going</v>

6000
02:43:13.841 --> 02:43:14.111
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>

6001
02:43:14.111 --> 02:43:14.591
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

6002
02:43:14.591 --> 02:43:17.350
<v Speaker 2>that's also one of the reasons why the idea of false flags,</v>

6003
02:43:17.810 --> 02:43:21.040
<v Speaker 2>which a lot of people don't want to accept as a historical fact,</v>

6004
02:43:21.100 --> 02:43:24.610
<v Speaker 2>but I mean they of have a history channel talks about the Gulf of Tonkin,</v>

6005
02:43:25.360 --> 02:43:25.961
<v Speaker 2>Gulf of Tonkin.</v>

6006
02:43:25.961 --> 02:43:28.690
<v Speaker 2>It's declassified documents that fake that shit.</v>

6007
02:43:28.691 --> 02:43:31.440
<v Speaker 2>So there's an awareness like after a certain age we're like,</v>

6008
02:43:31.500 --> 02:43:32.333
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>

6009
02:43:32.680 --> 02:43:32.981
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

6010
02:43:32.981 --> 02:43:33.990
<v Speaker 2>we fucking lie to you.</v>

6011
02:43:34.450 --> 02:43:35.380
<v Speaker 2>Million people died,</v>

6012
02:43:35.440 --> 02:43:35.831
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

6013
02:43:35.831 --> 02:43:39.370
<v Speaker 2>Whatever we don't do anymore because if it's long enough,</v>

6014
02:43:39.371 --> 02:43:41.890
<v Speaker 2>people just don't even notice that the truth came out like,</v>

6015
02:43:41.910 --> 02:43:42.270
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

6016
02:43:42.270 --> 02:43:43.360

6017
02:43:44.010 --> 02:43:44.840
<v Speaker 2>We don't do that anymore.</v>

6018
02:43:44.840 --> 02:43:45.490
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

6019
02:43:45.490 --> 02:43:46.031

6022
02:43:47.010 --> 02:43:47.980
<v Speaker 2>Do you think freedom is free?</v>

6023
02:43:48.070 --> 02:43:49.310
