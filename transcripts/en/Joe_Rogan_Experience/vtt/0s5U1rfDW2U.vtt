<v Speaker 1>you're wrong.</v>

20
00:00:28.641 --> 00:00:31.640
<v Speaker 1>What you're saying is just worship hauled on it.</v>

24
00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:34.160
<v Speaker 1>you're lying.</v>

25
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.233
<v Speaker 1>Stop lying.</v>

26
00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.100
<v Speaker 1>It's a little bit of that going on.</v>

27
00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.120
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

28
00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:39.650
<v Speaker 1>it's unbelievable.</v>

29
00:00:39.651 --> 00:00:39.861
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

30
00:00:39.861 --> 00:00:41.150
<v Speaker 1>one of the things I was saying to a friend,</v>

31
00:00:41.151 --> 00:00:44.450
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about one thing that I don't like about people that are</v>

32
00:00:44.451 --> 00:00:45.284
<v Speaker 1>struggling,</v>

33
00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:46.790
<v Speaker 1>especially struggling as actors,</v>

34
00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.520
<v Speaker 1>it's the arena that they're forced to compete in the arena.</v>

35
00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.370
<v Speaker 1>They're forced to compete is an arena where they're constantly going to</v>

36
00:00:52.371 --> 00:00:56.330
<v Speaker 1>auditions where there's this weird social thing going on where there's one</v>

37
00:00:56.331 --> 00:00:57.310
<v Speaker 1>person who's in control,</v>

38
00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:01.910
<v Speaker 1>the casting director and is a director who's observing you and your whole thing</v>

39
00:01:01.911 --> 00:01:05.960
<v Speaker 1>is about getting these people to like you quickly in a brief amount of time.</v>

40
00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:11.260
<v Speaker 1>And so they adopt like really obvious democratic left wing sort of tendencies</v>

41
00:01:11.541 --> 00:01:13.700
<v Speaker 1>and things to say and they adopt,</v>

42
00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:14.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

43
00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:17.450
<v Speaker 1>a very left wing mindset because that's the majority of the people in Hollywood</v>

44
00:01:17.451 --> 00:01:22.220
<v Speaker 1>are the left wing and they start spewing out shit that they think people want to</v>

45
00:01:22.221 --> 00:01:26.320
<v Speaker 1>hear as opposed to having a real thoughtful opinion on something that's,</v>

46
00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:27.350
<v Speaker 1>that's a very good point.</v>

47
00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.670
<v Speaker 1>Very few people have the luxury of having a real thoughtful opinion.</v>

48
00:01:31.671 --> 00:01:33.620
<v Speaker 1>It's all about getting someone to like you.</v>

49
00:01:33.621 --> 00:01:36.170
<v Speaker 1>It's all about getting into the door and it's so,</v>

50
00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:37.401
<v Speaker 1>so true,</v>

51
00:01:37.401 --> 00:01:37.760
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

52
00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.800
<v Speaker 1>Terrible weight of thinking about that the other day.</v>

53
00:01:39.801 --> 00:01:40.730
<v Speaker 1>That is so true.</v>

54
00:01:40.731 --> 00:01:41.564
<v Speaker 1>That becomes this,</v>

55
00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:42.780
<v Speaker 1>this way.</v>

56
00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:43.520
<v Speaker 1>You have to,</v>

57
00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:44.030
<v Speaker 1>you have,</v>

58
00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.130
<v Speaker 1>you're bullied into speaking a certain way.</v>

59
00:01:46.131 --> 00:01:46.881
<v Speaker 1>Cause if you don't,</v>

60
00:01:46.881 --> 00:01:49.910
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be considered a shithead or you know,</v>

61
00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:50.900
<v Speaker 1>not on the team man.</v>

62
00:01:50.901 --> 00:01:52.570
<v Speaker 1>You don't know the tone of the team and,</v>

63
00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:53.690
<v Speaker 1>and you see it all the time.</v>

64
00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.370
<v Speaker 1>Well the left wing aspect of it is</v>

65
00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:57.133
<v Speaker 2>kills ideas.</v>

66
00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.961
<v Speaker 2>Jimmy Schubert,</v>

67
00:01:57.961 --> 00:01:58.990
<v Speaker 2>I forget what he calls her love.</v>

68
00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:00.040
<v Speaker 2>She calls herself a,</v>

69
00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

70
00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.580
<v Speaker 2>a liberal conservative or whatever because he wants to work in show</v>

71
00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:07.063
<v Speaker 1>each human.</v>

72
00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.040
<v Speaker 1>He could never go to an audition with a Mitt Romney shirt on.</v>

73
00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:12.440
<v Speaker 1>There was not a single fucking person would ever hire you.</v>

74
00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:14.270
<v Speaker 1>That's something that they would really,</v>

75
00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.040
<v Speaker 1>it would prejudge you for sure.</v>

76
00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:17.420
<v Speaker 1>Let me go get this Guy Outta here.</v>

77
00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:18.401
<v Speaker 2>That is a hard game though.</v>

78
00:02:18.401 --> 00:02:18.941
<v Speaker 2>Acting man.</v>

79
00:02:18.941 --> 00:02:19.751
<v Speaker 2>I know there was a,</v>

80
00:02:19.751 --> 00:02:21.430
<v Speaker 2>when I lived in that building and Korea town,</v>

81
00:02:21.431 --> 00:02:24.100
<v Speaker 2>there was a actor guy that lived in my building.</v>

82
00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.851
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

83
00:02:24.851 --> 00:02:25.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

84
00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:26.910
<v Speaker 2>it's starting to get up there in age for,</v>

85
00:02:26.911 --> 00:02:28.090
<v Speaker 2>for an actor or whatever.</v>

86
00:02:28.091 --> 00:02:30.910
<v Speaker 2>And I guess his was work kind of dried up.</v>

87
00:02:30.911 --> 00:02:31.744
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

88
00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.910
<v Speaker 2>for some reason when I would see this guy,</v>

89
00:02:33.911 --> 00:02:35.620
<v Speaker 2>he would tell me everything about his life.</v>

90
00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.480
<v Speaker 2>For some reason he thought we were,</v>

91
00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:37.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

92
00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:38.470
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Great friends.</v>

94
00:02:39.011 --> 00:02:40.780
<v Speaker 2>I told the guy very little about me,</v>

95
00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.440
<v Speaker 2>he just would always just spew all this information about himself.</v>

96
00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:46.330
<v Speaker 2>And I remember him telling me,</v>

97
00:02:46.331 --> 00:02:49.780
<v Speaker 2>cause it was a bar downstairs in that building and him telling me one night the,</v>

98
00:02:49.781 --> 00:02:49.931
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:41.960
<v Speaker 1>Separate all this come from,</v>

169
00:04:41.961 --> 00:04:42.461
<v Speaker 1>I knew a guy,</v>

170
00:04:42.461 --> 00:04:44.300
<v Speaker 1>my acting class and you know how long I was smacking</v>

171
00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:45.970
<v Speaker 2>in class years.</v>

172
00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:47.680
<v Speaker 2>I loved it by the way,</v>

173
00:04:47.681 --> 00:04:48.700
<v Speaker 2>for a lot of reasons.</v>

174
00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:51.450
<v Speaker 2>Mainly because it was just fun to be in just,</v>

175
00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:55.270
<v Speaker 2>there was a lot of craziness and Joe would always make fun of me.</v>

176
00:04:55.271 --> 00:04:56.110
<v Speaker 2>But there was a guy,</v>

177
00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:57.003
<v Speaker 2>really good guy,</v>

178
00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:57.963
<v Speaker 2>normal guy.</v>

179
00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:00.220
<v Speaker 2>So I thought and he was,</v>

180
00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:05.230
<v Speaker 2>and I hired him to shoot me to shoot this audition.</v>

181
00:05:05.231 --> 00:05:08.980
<v Speaker 2>So I go to his house and he's got this great camera and on his wall is a dream</v>

<v Speaker 1>No matter what I do and can happen,</v>

259
00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:24.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting fucking knocked out cause my bone structure or for a thousand</v>

<v Speaker 1>yes you should dream big,</v>

266
00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:35.780

267
00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:40.520
<v Speaker 1>So when you say someone told him that all you have to do is use the power of</v>

268
00:07:40.521 --> 00:07:41.351
<v Speaker 1>positive thing.</v>

272
00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:50.560
<v Speaker 1>And what happens when you read books about it and it's written enough.</v>

<v Speaker 1>this must be this.</v>

276
00:07:54.291 --> 00:07:55.340
<v Speaker 1>This is a truth.</v>

277
00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:05.190
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
