23
00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.410
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're calling it the last podcasting,</v>

24
00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:15.890
<v Speaker 2>the last podcast on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

25
00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.210
<v Speaker 2>we configure it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The name like I,</v>

26
00:01:17.211 --> 00:01:19.120
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to kind of have like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>silly name.</v>

27
00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:22.800
<v Speaker 1>Kevin Smith took the rubber off your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your stuff it back on.</v>

28
00:01:22.801 --> 00:01:24.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's real particular.</v>

29
00:01:24.031 --> 00:01:26.490
<v Speaker 1>It was really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think these things are good.</v>

30
00:01:26.491 --> 00:01:27.450
<v Speaker 1>The spit yields,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

31
00:01:27.451 --> 00:01:29.280
<v Speaker 1>people like that pop and shit in their</v>
<v Speaker 1>ear.</v>

32
00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.500
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kevin Smith likes to hear it raw</v>

33
00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:32.460
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

34
00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:33.750
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm sorry.</v>

35
00:01:33.751 --> 00:01:34.501
<v Speaker 1>So what do you call it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The end.</v>

36
00:01:34.501 --> 00:01:36.450
<v Speaker 1>What's the podcast?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Last podcast?</v>

37
00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.610
<v Speaker 1>The last podcasting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the last one.</v>

38
00:01:38.611 --> 00:01:40.300
<v Speaker 1>Are you claiming this is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one asked.</v>

39
00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.450
<v Speaker 2>That'd be good just because it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously playing on last comic</v>

40
00:01:44.451 --> 00:01:46.070
<v Speaker 2>standing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We didn't know if you want to call it</v>

41
00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.440
<v Speaker 2>where you get a clown horn behind it.</v>

42
00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.430
<v Speaker 1>Is the last comic standing like such a</v>
<v Speaker 1>big thing in your life that you would do</v>

43
00:01:52.431 --> 00:01:53.210
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It mean,</v>

44
00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.550
<v Speaker 1>is it like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that like when you look back at your</v>

45
00:01:55.551 --> 00:01:57.860
<v Speaker 1>accomplishments as a comic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that like the number one thing?</v>

46
00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.500
<v Speaker 2>I don't think she'll personally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

47
00:02:00.501 --> 00:02:03.110
<v Speaker 2>it's one of those things you don't know</v>
<v Speaker 2>where your path would have went.</v>

48
00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.220
<v Speaker 2>You like you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if I didn't do the show,</v>

49
00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.020
<v Speaker 2>what I would just be just that headliner</v>
<v Speaker 2>who makes nothing just with a couple of</v>

50
00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.933
<v Speaker 2>special things.</v>

51
00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.200
<v Speaker 1>Kind of different than doing standup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

52
00:02:13.201 --> 00:02:17.130
<v Speaker 1>Because you're doing stand up and these</v>
<v Speaker 1>little short bursts for an audience and</v>

53
00:02:17.131 --> 00:02:19.470
<v Speaker 1>you like trying to get them to vote for</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

54
00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.710
<v Speaker 1>Did you find yourself like altering your</v>
<v Speaker 1>material?</v>

55
00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.280
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I'm long,</v>

56
00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:25.850
<v Speaker 2>not long winded,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my,</v>

57
00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.450
<v Speaker 2>my jokes are are long so I'll stick with</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same subject.</v>

58
00:02:29.451 --> 00:02:30.970
<v Speaker 2>Didn't have jokes every couple of</v>
<v Speaker 2>seconds.</v>

59
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.040
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So to do a four and a half,</v>

60
00:02:33.041 --> 00:02:35.620
<v Speaker 2>five minute set is really hard for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

61
00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.180
<v Speaker 2>And I did on my feet and I did 12,</v>
<v Speaker 2>five minute TV sets,</v>

62
00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.600
<v Speaker 2>not repeating stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So my brain doesn't click together.</v>

63
00:02:43.601 --> 00:02:46.870
<v Speaker 2>Small sets like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that was you that that must've been a</v>

64
00:02:46.871 --> 00:02:50.560
<v Speaker 2>difficult counts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Twelve I did five minute sets and other</v>

65
00:02:50.561 --> 00:02:53.210
<v Speaker 2>other sees a whole hour of almost.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

66
00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.350
<v Speaker 2>cause every material I got challenged</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost every episode.</v>

67
00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.160
<v Speaker 2>So you perform then the next show and</v>
<v Speaker 2>for that don't understand why</v>

68
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.620
<v Speaker 1>that would be a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's why it would be a big deal for a</v>

69
00:03:02.621 --> 00:03:06.190
<v Speaker 1>guy like John or a guy like me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have similar writing style so that we</v>

70
00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:11.310
<v Speaker 1>we go into a bit and that bit will will</v>
<v Speaker 1>squeeze every thought out of that bit</v>

71
00:03:11.921 --> 00:03:16.921
<v Speaker 1>and use it to transition to another bit</v>
<v Speaker 1>and those segways are kind of difficult</v>

72
00:03:17.021 --> 00:03:19.180
<v Speaker 1>to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's very important to make sure</v>

73
00:03:19.181 --> 00:03:22.060
<v Speaker 1>that the material flow seamlessly</v>
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

74
00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.320
<v Speaker 1>If there's a hiccup in the subjects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the audience can pick up on it and</v>

75
00:03:26.321 --> 00:03:28.300
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't click with their brain as</v>
<v Speaker 1>much,</v>

76
00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.350
<v Speaker 1>so it's really hard to do these little</v>
<v Speaker 1>five minute sets and break them up</v>

77
00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.940
<v Speaker 1>because oftentimes one bit will lead</v>
<v Speaker 1>into another bit and one bid by itself</v>

78
00:03:36.941 --> 00:03:40.840
<v Speaker 1>may only be like two minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it causes a 10 minute bit because</v>

79
00:03:40.841 --> 00:03:43.720
<v Speaker 1>it's the catalyst for all this other</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff that comes after it,</v>

80
00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.600
<v Speaker 1>which you really just can't get away</v>
<v Speaker 1>with in a five minute set</v>

81
00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:47.600
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's real.</v>

82
00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:51.380
<v Speaker 2>And then if you're used to not memorize</v>
<v Speaker 2>them but telling stories that way to go.</v>

83
00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.780
<v Speaker 2>So what's with Mcdonald's?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was in a car recently.</v>

84
00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.870
<v Speaker 2>I hate flood and do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your brain doesn't usually,</v>

85
00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.900
<v Speaker 2>it's harder for me to say no or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or remember perfectly a four and a half</v>

86
00:04:01.971 --> 00:04:03.860
<v Speaker 2>minutes at then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would be for an hour and a half.</v>

87
00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:06.830
<v Speaker 2>So do you think like as it's so</v>
<v Speaker 2>disjointed for me.</v>

88
00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.770
<v Speaker 1>So do you think that that must have</v>
<v Speaker 1>helped you to,</v>

89
00:04:09.771 --> 00:04:11.750
<v Speaker 1>as a comic?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just the challenge of doing that.</v>

90
00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:13.350
<v Speaker 2>Why did I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah.</v>

91
00:04:13.351 --> 00:04:17.460
<v Speaker 2>So it was all those sets and then the</v>
<v Speaker 2>very literally the next day when I,</v>

92
00:04:17.461 --> 00:04:20.400
<v Speaker 2>when I was performing when you a bunch</v>
<v Speaker 2>of theaters,</v>

93
00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:25.290
<v Speaker 2>I felt the need to write a new hour as</v>
<v Speaker 2>fast as possible because people wouldn't</v>

94
00:04:25.291 --> 00:04:30.291
<v Speaker 2>want to hear what they just heard for</v>
<v Speaker 2>nine weeks of Network television of</v>

95
00:04:30.361 --> 00:04:31.410
<v Speaker 2>course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

96
00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.380
<v Speaker 2>but so out of the 15 years leading up to</v>
<v Speaker 2>last comic,</v>

97
00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:38.940
<v Speaker 2>I wrote what I think was a funnier our.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I've gotten more out of that hour as</v>

98
00:04:38.941 --> 00:04:41.220
<v Speaker 2>far as development deals and pitching</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff to networks,</v>

99
00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.620
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in probably two or three months just out</v>

100
00:04:43.621 --> 00:04:48.500
<v Speaker 2>of sheer fear of I need to come up with</v>
<v Speaker 2>new material to survive or this is going</v>

101
00:04:48.501 --> 00:04:48.900
<v Speaker 2>to stop.</v>

102
00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.070
<v Speaker 1>Louis ck just had a video that I found</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the Internet.</v>

103
00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.890
<v Speaker 1>Somebody posted on the message board</v>
<v Speaker 1>where he's talking about George Carlin</v>

104
00:04:55.891 --> 00:05:00.030
<v Speaker 1>and how George Carlin inspired him that</v>
<v Speaker 1>after like 15 years he was doing the</v>

105
00:05:00.031 --> 00:05:05.010
<v Speaker 1>same act leg literally for 15 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he was listening to Carla and</v>

106
00:05:05.011 --> 00:05:07.080
<v Speaker 1>talk about how he does comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how he does it,</v>

107
00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:10.350
<v Speaker 1>and he throws the whole hour away every</v>
<v Speaker 1>year and starts with a new one.</v>

108
00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:12.770
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the Louis thought it was so crazy.</v>

109
00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:15.870
<v Speaker 1>He was like crying in the car while it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was listening to this because he was</v>

110
00:05:15.871 --> 00:05:17.340
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it a moment where it's like,</v>

111
00:05:17.341 --> 00:05:19.840
<v Speaker 1>I fucking hate what I'm doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I stand up.</v>

112
00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:21.720
<v Speaker 1>I said that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that challenge.</v>

113
00:05:21.721 --> 00:05:22.680
<v Speaker 1>Look how good he is now.</v>

114
00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:26.190
<v Speaker 2>And it's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think habits are definitely</v>

115
00:05:26.191 --> 00:05:28.140
<v Speaker 2>contagious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You hang out with certain people that do</v>

116
00:05:28.141 --> 00:05:29.460
<v Speaker 2>certain things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll do that.</v>

117
00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:34.670
<v Speaker 2>I just saw a Louis in San Francisco at a</v>
<v Speaker 2>show and then I went to his midnight</v>

118
00:05:34.681 --> 00:05:38.910
<v Speaker 2>show and watched him and I left in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>week after.</v>

119
00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:41.180
<v Speaker 2>I just saw,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a couple of weeks ago onstage,</v>

120
00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:46.280
<v Speaker 2>I think I did 15 minutes of new stuff</v>
<v Speaker 2>just because the ceiling was raised.</v>

121
00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:48.270
<v Speaker 2>You like you can go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do really well.</v>

122
00:05:48.271 --> 00:05:52.620
<v Speaker 2>I crush it and then you see somebody who</v>
<v Speaker 2>is working on a new hour and for my hair</v>

123
00:05:52.621 --> 00:05:54.240
<v Speaker 2>from the club.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He went there Wednesday,</v>

124
00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:57.530
<v Speaker 2>figured out some stuff from my Sunday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They go in those days,</v>

125
00:05:57.531 --> 00:06:00.310
<v Speaker 2>his stuff became so tight because he can</v>
<v Speaker 2>go home and he'd.</v>

126
00:06:00.311 --> 00:06:02.270
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it inspired me to go,</v>

127
00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:03.240
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to do that.</v>

128
00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:05.470
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to do the same thing and in</v>

129
00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:08.590
<v Speaker 2>some restructuring everything for that</v>
<v Speaker 2>reason where you just get</v>

130
00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.180
<v Speaker 1>board onstage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

131
00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:12.980
<v Speaker 1>Getting inspired by the comics is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>greatest fucking thing ever.</v>

132
00:06:12.981 --> 00:06:14.330
<v Speaker 1>It's a humbling thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

133
00:06:14.331 --> 00:06:17.660
<v Speaker 1>you see someone who's really killing it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's like just how like a regular</v>

134
00:06:17.661 --> 00:06:21.590
<v Speaker 1>person watches stand up and they can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>really quite believe that someone can do</v>

135
00:06:21.591 --> 00:06:23.140
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people that watch stand</v>

136
00:06:23.141 --> 00:06:25.460
<v Speaker 1>up and they can imagine themselves doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>it well.</v>

137
00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:28.330
<v Speaker 1>That same feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get kind of get that same feeling</v>

138
00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:30.320
<v Speaker 1>when you watch someone who's really</v>
<v Speaker 1>great at it.</v>

139
00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:31.850
<v Speaker 1>When you want someone who's really great</v>
<v Speaker 1>at you,</v>

140
00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:32.361
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

141
00:06:32.361 --> 00:06:36.020
<v Speaker 1>this mother fucker just hitting heights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't even want to know if you</v>

142
00:06:36.021 --> 00:06:37.580
<v Speaker 1>can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

143
00:06:37.581 --> 00:06:39.410
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't even.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't even want to think about it.</v>

144
00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:40.760
<v Speaker 1>All you want to do is just get to work.</v>

145
00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:42.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's Kinda like the one that guy ran the</v>

146
00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:45.320
<v Speaker 2>first four minute mile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

147
00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:47.170
<v Speaker 2>And then everybody else started falling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

148
00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:48.580
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a whole nother level.</v>

149
00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:49.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except you can't.</v>

150
00:06:49.761 --> 00:06:53.450
<v Speaker 1>You can think about running fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't think about getting funnier.</v>

151
00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:55.430
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just have to work.</v>

152
00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:57.090
<v Speaker 1>You just have to work at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when you.</v>

153
00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:00.800
<v Speaker 1>When I say you can't think about getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>funnier when you can,</v>

154
00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:02.090
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's wrong.</v>

155
00:07:02.091 --> 00:07:04.730
<v Speaker 1>I mean you can be unhappy and decide to</v>
<v Speaker 1>improve,</v>

156
00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:07.880
<v Speaker 1>but that you can't be thinking about it</v>
<v Speaker 1>while you're up there.</v>

157
00:07:07.881 --> 00:07:09.580
<v Speaker 1>I have to be funnier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to be funny.</v>

158
00:07:09.581 --> 00:07:11.630
<v Speaker 1>Or You just have to be in that fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>groove.</v>

159
00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:14.600
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't be thinking like that's a</v>

160
00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:17.960
<v Speaker 1>thing that people don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you can't think I'm going to try to</v>

161
00:07:17.961 --> 00:07:18.990
<v Speaker 1>be funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't.</v>

<v Speaker 2>years and see what you don't like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See what you do like it.</v>

171

<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

173
00:07:47.741 --> 00:07:49.310
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a tricky game,</v>

174
00:07:49.311 --> 00:07:50.560
<v Speaker 2>the standup comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it,</v>

175
00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:53.050
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it for me in this last week,</v>

176
00:07:53.051 --> 00:07:58.051
<v Speaker 2>this happened after 23 years and how do</v>
<v Speaker 2>I write a solid Louis got motivated in a</v>

177
00:07:58.571 --> 00:07:59.321
<v Speaker 2>sense of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

178
00:07:59.321 --> 00:08:01.090
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to start challenging myself</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

179
00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:05.470
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I decided to rework the entire</v>

180
00:08:05.471 --> 00:08:07.150
<v Speaker 2>act,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like in this crazy.</v>

181
00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:11.860
<v Speaker 2>No one will know the system that I have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yet it got me really,</v>

182
00:08:11.861 --> 00:08:12.580
<v Speaker 2>really excited.</v>

183
00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:14.800
<v Speaker 2>You stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this whole week when I was in Tampa,</v>

184
00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:16.210
<v Speaker 2>no one will know the system that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>have.</v>

185
00:08:16.211 --> 00:08:17.050
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I won?</v>

186
00:08:17.051 --> 00:08:19.630
<v Speaker 2>I did know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It sounds like if you were watching,</v>

187
00:08:19.631 --> 00:08:21.040
<v Speaker 2>you would never know that this went</v>
<v Speaker 2>down,</v>

188
00:08:21.041 --> 00:08:24.550
<v Speaker 2>but I want to construct my whole act as</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hero's journey.</v>

189
00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:27.490
<v Speaker 2>Like in every movie you see about 10</v>
<v Speaker 2>minutes into the movie,</v>

190
00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:31.030
<v Speaker 2>something crazy happens to the character</v>
<v Speaker 2>that spins them off in the movie while</v>

191
00:08:31.031 --> 00:08:34.630
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to put my whole act together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're at 10 minutes in I,</v>

192
00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:37.060
<v Speaker 2>I tell you I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I got to make a</v>

193
00:08:37.061 --> 00:08:38.560
<v Speaker 2>decision,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I might want to get divorced.</v>

194
00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:41.770
<v Speaker 2>And then suddenly the crowds like what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then it's my journey and then the</v>

195
00:08:41.771 --> 00:08:45.190
<v Speaker 2>thing I got this huge master plan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's how I've always done my act,</v>

196
00:08:45.191 --> 00:08:49.240
<v Speaker 2>but I'm really going to try to hit beats</v>
<v Speaker 2>where suddenly you're going to have a</v>

197
00:08:49.241 --> 00:08:51.650
<v Speaker 2>romantic part in the middle of it to</v>
<v Speaker 2>take</v>

198
00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:54.870
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but listening,</v>

199
00:08:54.890 --> 00:08:56.430
<v Speaker 2>you're just going to laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can a romantic.</v>

200
00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:57.930
<v Speaker 1>What is this Jim Carrey movie?</v>

201
00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:00.870
<v Speaker 3>It's something called like Philip</v>
<v Speaker 3>Morris.</v>

202
00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.320
<v Speaker 3>I Love Philip Morris and it was a</v>
<v Speaker 3>Netflix film.</v>

203
00:09:04.321 --> 00:09:04.801
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow.</v>

204

<v Speaker 3>I like Jim Carrey and it here in</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mcgregor.</v>

205
00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:09.750
<v Speaker 3>And then I'm like laying in bed last</v>
<v Speaker 3>night after watching red state.</v>

206
00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:14.250
<v Speaker 3>And I watched it and I was like</v>
<v Speaker 3>disgusted.</v>

207
00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:18.900
<v Speaker 3>There was parts where Jim Carrey was</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking guys from behind very violently</v>

208
00:09:18.901 --> 00:09:20.350
<v Speaker 3>and you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he has a shirt off,</v>

209
00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:24.480
<v Speaker 3>he's got to come in me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

210
00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:27.160

<v Speaker 3>And so then it.</v>

212

<v Speaker 3>Then there's a part where it Ian</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mcgregor and he's got this horrible</v>

213
00:09:34.051 --> 00:09:37.950

<v Speaker 3>jail where like there's just a bunch of</v>

214
00:09:37.951 --> 00:09:41.130
<v Speaker 3>gay sex going on in jail and then make</v>
<v Speaker 3>it at the beginning of the movie they</v>

215
00:09:41.131 --> 00:09:44.550
<v Speaker 3>say it's like this all happened like</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a real story or something like</v>

216

<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

306
00:13:54.810 --> 00:13:57.690

<v Speaker 1>just a sperm machine.</v>

307
00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:02.520
<v Speaker 1>You're just managing this fucking</v>

<v Speaker 1>movies.</v>

356
00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:03.290
<v Speaker 1>Maybe this is an amazing human because</v>
<v Speaker 1>look is 71 percent on rotten tomatoes</v>

357
00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:08.330
<v Speaker 1>and tomato 71.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I say I trust rotten tomatoes.</v>

362
00:16:18.561 --> 00:16:22.310
<v Speaker 1>I say rotten tomatoes generally</v>
<v Speaker 1>represents how I feel about movies.</v>

363
00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:25.400
<v Speaker 1>Pretty accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's type in</v>

<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have not.</v>

369
00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:44.420
<v Speaker 1>Will you watch it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not,</v>

370
00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:48.760
<v Speaker 1>not after that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just know I'd rather see a 17 percent.</v>

371
00:16:48.761 --> 00:16:50.320
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

372
00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:54.010
<v Speaker 1>Look rotten tomatoes is on point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rotten tomatoes is on point.</v>

373
00:16:54.011 --> 00:16:56.730
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Type in [inaudible] 71 then that moves</v>

374
00:16:56.810 --> 00:16:59.490
<v Speaker 1>in red states.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't do it yet,</v>

375
00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:02.070
<v Speaker 1>but you'd love to read it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was like the best movie ever.</v>

376
00:17:04.990 --> 00:17:06.040
<v Speaker 1>I haven't seen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it is.</v>

377
00:17:06.041 --> 00:17:07.450
<v Speaker 1>Forty percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>

378
00:17:07.570 --> 00:17:09.370
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really liked that movie.</v>

379
00:17:09.371 --> 00:17:12.380
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was way better than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've talked to people in line.</v>

380
00:17:12.381 --> 00:17:13.270
<v Speaker 1>I didn't like it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

381
00:17:13.330 --> 00:17:15.460
<v Speaker 1>Rotten tomatoes is not accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One hundred percent.</v>

382
00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:19.420
<v Speaker 1>I think it is and I think Phillip Morris</v>
<v Speaker 1>might be the best but fucking movie in</v>

383
00:17:19.421 --> 00:17:22.390
<v Speaker 1>the history of the movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I got to go with that.</v>

384
00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:26.050
<v Speaker 1>I wish rotten tomatoes was just tuned</v>
<v Speaker 1>into what you like,</v>

385
00:17:26.170 --> 00:17:26.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

387
00:17:28.330 --> 00:17:30.280
<v Speaker 1>Maybe there's a program like that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can say,</v>

<v Speaker 1>and get the full?</v>

395
00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:51.720
<v Speaker 1>Do you do that problem is that you'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>never expand.</v>

396
00:17:51.721 --> 00:17:54.000

422
00:18:58.431 --> 00:19:01.970
<v Speaker 1>but they had driven the Jens pulver</v>
<v Speaker 1>documentary,</v>

00:19:01.971 --> 00:19:05.270
<v Speaker 1>which is pretty obscure even in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world of mixed martial arts.</v>

424
00:19:05.271 --> 00:19:07.010
<v Speaker 1>I don't know a lot of people who know</v>

00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:31.070
<v Speaker 3>which is understandable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's some of them,</v>

463
00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:33.710
<v Speaker 1>some of this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people complain about those</v>

464
00:20:33.711 --> 00:20:35.620
<v Speaker 1>ads,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I stopped the whole screen.</v>

465
00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:37.220
<v Speaker 1>You miss a chunk of the podcast,</v>

466
00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:40.260
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I took all my stuff after it's</v>

467
00:20:40.261 --> 00:20:43.800
<v Speaker 3>broadcast live,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I take it off your stream and put it on</v>

468
00:20:43.801 --> 00:20:48.790
<v Speaker 3>Vimeo just because I have a pro account.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never used vimeo and now that apple TV</v>

469
00:20:48.791 --> 00:20:51.550
<v Speaker 3>started vimeo on the apple tv,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

470
00:20:51.551 --> 00:20:53.740
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm moving everything to vimeo now</v>

471
00:20:53.890 --> 00:20:56.740
<v Speaker 3>because Vimeo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my youtube accounts always get canceled.</v>

472
00:20:56.770 --> 00:20:59.110
<v Speaker 3>They always get busted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I had a director account,</v>

473
00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:03.550
<v Speaker 3>which I don't know you when you first</v>
<v Speaker 3>signed up for Youtube back in the day</v>

474
00:21:03.970 --> 00:21:07.240
<v Speaker 3>view made longer videos that were like</v>
<v Speaker 3>over 10 minutes,</v>

475
00:21:07.241 --> 00:21:09.130
<v Speaker 3>which is what the limit was at that</v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

476
00:21:09.630 --> 00:21:11.680
<v Speaker 3>You could apply for a thing called a</v>
<v Speaker 3>director account,</v>

477
00:21:11.681 --> 00:21:13.870
<v Speaker 3>which gave you access to put movies on</v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

478
00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:17.320
<v Speaker 3>like Youtube was trying to reach out to</v>
<v Speaker 3>small independent directors.</v>

479
00:21:17.530 --> 00:21:21.190
<v Speaker 3>I got that account.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They stopped that a year later and now</v>

480
00:21:21.191 --> 00:21:23.260
<v Speaker 3>the only.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have like 15 minute limits on</v>

481
00:21:23.261 --> 00:21:25.450
<v Speaker 3>youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody has any longer and Listeria</v>

482
00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:27.440
<v Speaker 3>company.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How come I see that though sometimes</v>

483
00:21:27.470 --> 00:21:30.400
<v Speaker 3>because all the director accounts got</v>
<v Speaker 3>grandfathered.</v>

484
00:21:30.550 --> 00:21:35.550
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Youtube recently took my director</v>

485
00:21:36.551 --> 00:21:38.590
<v Speaker 1>account away so I can't do that on</v>
<v Speaker 1>youtube anymore.</v>

486
00:21:38.620 --> 00:21:40.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We used to be able to upload longer shit</v>

487
00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:45.880
<v Speaker 1>and I remember I tried to upload one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the podcasts video blogs that we do on</v>

488
00:21:45.911 --> 00:21:49.030
<v Speaker 1>Vimeo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have 10 of them up there and what we</v>

489
00:21:49.031 --> 00:21:53.200
<v Speaker 1>do is after we have an interview,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we sit down and we videotape like,</v>

490
00:21:53.201 --> 00:21:55.300
<v Speaker 1>oh that was fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'd shoot the shit for a little bit and</v>

491
00:21:55.630 --> 00:21:58.240
<v Speaker 1>get to just whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just something else to do.</v>

492
00:21:58.590 --> 00:22:00.080
<v Speaker 1>Just fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

493
00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:03.610
<v Speaker 1>So we started putting those up on Vimeo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're like way better quality than</v>

494
00:22:03.611 --> 00:22:07.090
<v Speaker 1>Youtube and they let you put like 15,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 minutes.</v>

495
00:22:07.091 --> 00:22:08.180
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

496
00:22:08.181 --> 00:22:12.160
<v Speaker 1>like do it as long as you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Youtube is like smaller and shittier</v>

497
00:22:12.161 --> 00:22:13.810
<v Speaker 1>quality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess some.</v>

498
00:22:13.870 --> 00:22:16.570
<v Speaker 1>Some of the youtubes or a nice hd now</v>
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

499
00:22:16.571 --> 00:22:17.141
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

500
00:22:17.141 --> 00:22:17.531
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

501
00:22:17.531 --> 00:22:21.370
<v Speaker 1>but that's why I use</v>
<v Speaker 1>vimeo just looks better,</v>

502
00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:22.230
<v Speaker 1>doesn't it?</v>

503
00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:25.400
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>vimeo actually from testing used to be</v>

504
00:22:25.630 --> 00:22:27.470
<v Speaker 3>eight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Youtube does a great job,</v>

505
00:22:27.471 --> 00:22:29.480
<v Speaker 3>but their hd stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you do it right and you follow the</v>

506
00:22:29.481 --> 00:22:31.640
<v Speaker 3>right code x,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're perfect and they're in more</v>

507
00:22:31.641 --> 00:22:33.160
<v Speaker 3>devices.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Smartphones,</v>

508
00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:34.550
<v Speaker 3>they actually have it down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pat.</v>

509
00:22:34.790 --> 00:22:37.130
<v Speaker 3>Vimeo is kind of cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a smaller company.</v>

510
00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:39.570
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they're up to par now that,</v>

511
00:22:39.650 --> 00:22:42.740
<v Speaker 3>but for awhile I thought Youtube hd was</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually a lot better,</v>

512
00:22:42.810 --> 00:22:45.750
<v Speaker 1>but our shit looks better on Vimeo than</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looks on Youtube.</v>

513
00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:48.880
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you might see the.</v>

514
00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:51.420
<v Speaker 3>One of the things that youtube is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're watching a video on youtube,</v>

515
00:22:51.421 --> 00:22:54.660
<v Speaker 3>it always defaults to like a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>times it defaults to the lowest</v>

516
00:22:55.060 --> 00:22:59.190
<v Speaker 3>resolution and so if the research,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like vimeo always put you in hd when</v>

517
00:22:59.191 --> 00:23:01.940
<v Speaker 3>you're on their page,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so a lot of times that's what it is.</v>

518
00:23:01.950 --> 00:23:03.240
<v Speaker 3>It's just a simple thing like that,</v>

519
00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:05.000
<v Speaker 1>oh fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Youtube.</v>

520
00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:07.730
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>youtube has a lot more users.</v>

521
00:23:07.970 --> 00:23:10.190
<v Speaker 1>They're definitely trying to save</v>
<v Speaker 1>bandwidth settings.</v>

522
00:23:10.550 --> 00:23:13.370
<v Speaker 1>There is settings in your youtube</v>
<v Speaker 1>account that makes it so it's always</v>

523
00:23:13.371 --> 00:23:16.070
<v Speaker 1>playing hd and always the best,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not defaulted to that.</v>

524
00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:18.470
<v Speaker 1>Speaking of Youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you see that video that they just</v>

525
00:23:18.471 --> 00:23:21.200
<v Speaker 1>put out of the chimps that were locked</v>
<v Speaker 1>up?</v>

526
00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:26.420
<v Speaker 1>They never saw sunlight for 30 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want to believe they were stolen</v>

527
00:23:26.421 --> 00:23:30.260
<v Speaker 1>from their mothers at birth and taken to</v>
<v Speaker 1>Austria and they were used,</v>

528
00:23:30.310 --> 00:23:32.630
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the labs where they were shot up with</v>

529
00:23:32.631 --> 00:23:37.280
<v Speaker 1>hepatitis and HIV and then they released</v>
<v Speaker 1>them from this.</v>

530
00:23:37.281 --> 00:23:38.070
<v Speaker 1>And then the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

531
00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:40.400
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they let these chimps outside for like</v>

532
00:23:40.401 --> 00:23:43.970
<v Speaker 1>the first time ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was crazy to see.</v>

533
00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:46.220
<v Speaker 1>And if you see that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you still think people should be</v>

534
00:23:46.221 --> 00:23:48.620
<v Speaker 1>experimented on champs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a sick fuck.</v>

535
00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:50.300
<v Speaker 1>Those fucking things.</v>

536
00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:53.390
<v Speaker 1>Getting think man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those things can think and they feel and</v>

537
00:23:53.391 --> 00:23:55.340
<v Speaker 1>they have emotions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're smart.</v>

538
00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:58.010
<v Speaker 1>And when they got outside and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>started seeing the sun,</v>

539
00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:00.680
<v Speaker 1>they started jumping up and hugging each</v>
<v Speaker 1>other,</v>

540
00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:04.180
<v Speaker 1>making each other and looking out and</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to figure out how to.</v>

541
00:24:04.230 --> 00:24:08.150
<v Speaker 1>How to walk on the grass and touching</v>
<v Speaker 1>things and hugging each other and</v>

542
00:24:08.151 --> 00:24:10.670
<v Speaker 1>laughing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is.</v>

543
00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:15.700
<v Speaker 1>That is the craziest thing that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>justify is taking intelligent animals</v>

544
00:24:15.801 --> 00:24:19.040
<v Speaker 1>and holding them captive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether it's dolphins or chimps.</v>

545
00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:21.770
<v Speaker 1>That is a fucking weird thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

546
00:24:21.771 --> 00:24:24.890
<v Speaker 1>I mean that is like slavery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might as well be slavery.</v>

547
00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:27.860
<v Speaker 1>If you know how smart champions locking</v>
<v Speaker 1>them up like that,</v>

548
00:24:27.861 --> 00:24:28.490
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might.</v>

549
00:24:28.490 --> 00:24:30.800
<v Speaker 1>It might as well be slavery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imprisoning them,</v>

550
00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:32.660
<v Speaker 1>stealing them from their mothers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

551
00:24:32.661 --> 00:24:34.760
<v Speaker 1>whoa man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

552
00:24:34.790 --> 00:24:38.480
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty fucking rough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're causing some serious pain.</v>

553
00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:41.840
<v Speaker 1>So real emotional pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And these poor animals.</v>

554
00:24:42.410 --> 00:24:46.310
<v Speaker 1>Smart fucking animals too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it's a weird video,</v>

555
00:24:46.311 --> 00:24:47.420
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really creepy.</v>

556
00:24:47.421 --> 00:24:50.960
<v Speaker 1>It makes you feel bad to be a person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes you feel bad at someone's doing</v>

557
00:24:50.961 --> 00:24:52.070
<v Speaker 1>stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

558
00:24:52.071 --> 00:24:53.180
<v Speaker 1>I know there's a lot of people out</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

559
00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:54.290
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

560
00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:58.220
<v Speaker 1>If it wasn't for those</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

561
00:24:58.221 --> 00:24:59.660
<v Speaker 1>are you sure?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

562
00:24:59.690 --> 00:25:01.370
<v Speaker 1>Vaccines are awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't get me wrong,</v>

563
00:25:01.550 --> 00:25:03.920
<v Speaker 1>it is awesome that they figured out a</v>
<v Speaker 1>way to cure a lot of diseases.</v>

564
00:25:03.921 --> 00:25:08.270
<v Speaker 1>You're absolutely right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at what cost that cost?</v>

565
00:25:08.271 --> 00:25:11.510
<v Speaker 1>Is that the only way to do it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm down with you doing shit to a</v>

566
00:25:11.511 --> 00:25:13.040
<v Speaker 1>rabbit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to fuck with a rabbit.</v>

567
00:25:13.350 --> 00:25:15.590
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't really bother me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when they can think,</v>

568
00:25:15.591 --> 00:25:17.840
<v Speaker 1>when they're smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know rabbits get scared.</v>

569
00:25:17.841 --> 00:25:19.910
<v Speaker 1>It sucks to be them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're fucking rabbits.</v>

570
00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:23.390
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The new people don't want to hierarch</v>

571
00:25:23.391 --> 00:25:26.000
<v Speaker 1>animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a reason why some animals</v>

572
00:25:26.001 --> 00:25:28.670
<v Speaker 1>just sit around and eat and shit and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's it,</v>

573
00:25:28.810 --> 00:25:32.060
<v Speaker 1>and then there's other ones that are way</v>
<v Speaker 1>stronger than eat those motherfuckers.</v>

574
00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:33.950
<v Speaker 1>That's why those motherfuckers are</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

575
00:25:33.951 --> 00:25:35.900
<v Speaker 1>Their food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they might not know it.</v>

576
00:25:35.901 --> 00:25:37.490
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They think they're just grass eaters.</v>

577
00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:40.220
<v Speaker 1>They all serve a little piece,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little piece in the pie,</v>

578
00:25:41.330 --> 00:25:44.270
<v Speaker 1>but chimps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chimps are so close to us to lock them</v>

579
00:25:44.271 --> 00:25:46.580
<v Speaker 1>up like that and see them come out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>this thing.</v>

580
00:25:46.581 --> 00:25:49.040
<v Speaker 1>It was really heartbreaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was really confusing.</v>

581
00:25:49.410 --> 00:25:50.091
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

582
00:25:50.091 --> 00:25:50.570
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

583
00:25:50.570 --> 00:25:53.960
<v Speaker 1>This doesn't seem to be something that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we should be doing in 2011.</v>

584
00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:58.850
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't seem like we should be doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>any studies on chimps at this stage.</v>

585
00:25:59.150 --> 00:26:00.980
<v Speaker 1>It's like we know enough about human</v>
<v Speaker 1>beings.</v>

586
00:26:00.981 --> 00:26:03.140
<v Speaker 1>We know enough about feelings and</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotions.</v>

587
00:26:03.141 --> 00:26:06.830
<v Speaker 1>We know enough about how close they are</v>
<v Speaker 1>to us and yet we're still willing to do</v>

588
00:26:06.831 --> 00:26:08.150
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fucked up.</v>

589
00:26:08.690 --> 00:26:11.390
<v Speaker 1>I'd be better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be happier if they were doing it to</v>

590
00:26:11.391 --> 00:26:14.900
<v Speaker 1>murderers happier if they were doing the</v>
<v Speaker 1>shitheads rapists.</v>

591
00:26:14.930 --> 00:26:17.750
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of confirmed out there.</v>

592
00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:21.590
<v Speaker 1>Some confirmed jailed up cons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you learned through experiments for</v>

593
00:26:21.591 --> 00:26:23.360
<v Speaker 1>real?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why don't we do it on them?</v>

594
00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:24.291
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people go,</v>

595
00:26:24.291 --> 00:26:26.420
<v Speaker 1>you can't do them to voluntary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

596
00:26:26.570 --> 00:26:28.610
<v Speaker 1>but you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So is rape and murder.</v>

597
00:26:28.730 --> 00:26:31.700
<v Speaker 1>If someone's acutely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if someone is guilty of rape and murder,</v>

598
00:26:31.790 --> 00:26:33.830
<v Speaker 1>then the question is how do you know for</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure that they're guilty?</v>

599
00:26:33.831 --> 00:26:36.230
<v Speaker 1>They didn't just get fucked by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>system because they have no money and</v>

600
00:26:36.231 --> 00:26:39.190
<v Speaker 1>they couldn't afford a good lawyer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that are that go.</v>

601
00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:39.691
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>

602
00:26:39.691 --> 00:26:42.710
<v Speaker 1>I killed all 12 of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were sleeping in their beds.</v>

603
00:26:42.711 --> 00:26:44.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Came through the window and I killed</v>

604
00:26:44.431 --> 00:26:46.360
<v Speaker 1>them off the articles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

605
00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:49.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking experiment on them.</v>

606
00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:53.010
<v Speaker 1>Leave those chimps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chimps never did shit to nobody.</v>

607
00:26:53.011 --> 00:26:56.370
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to steal them from their</v>
<v Speaker 1>mother's little baby champs and final</v>

608
00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:57.870
<v Speaker 1>white discount on them and ship.</v>

609
00:26:57.900 --> 00:26:58.601
<v Speaker 1>But why don't we?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

610
00:26:58.601 --> 00:27:00.630
<v Speaker 1>Why can we?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because people are pussies.</v>

611
00:27:00.690 --> 00:27:03.570
<v Speaker 1>That's why we're going to kill them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should like that week ahead of time,</v>

612
00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:06.990
<v Speaker 1>she'd be all exterior Jason Bourne and</v>
<v Speaker 1>look how that worked out.</v>

613
00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:08.940
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was a member of the Ted nugent message</v>

614
00:27:08.941 --> 00:27:10.410
<v Speaker 1>board.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tell you that.</v>

615
00:27:10.411 --> 00:27:13.050
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck the problem is the God</v>
<v Speaker 1>damn liberals,</v>

616
00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:16.710
<v Speaker 1>but they're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's the liberals is the idea</v>

617
00:27:16.870 --> 00:27:21.870
<v Speaker 1>of constant compassion and the need to</v>
<v Speaker 1>to treat all human beings is absolutely</v>

618
00:27:23.101 --> 00:27:25.080
<v Speaker 1>equal despite their past and what</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've done.</v>

619
00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:28.080
<v Speaker 1>Listen man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're some fucking religious person</v>

620
00:27:28.081 --> 00:27:32.010
<v Speaker 1>who's completely recanted from your</v>
<v Speaker 1>horrible life and it seems that you've</v>

621
00:27:32.011 --> 00:27:32.850
<v Speaker 1>done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

622
00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:37.770
<v Speaker 1>like as much as possible to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make up for your shitty actions in</v>

623
00:27:37.771 --> 00:27:39.660
<v Speaker 1>the past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's people that have made mistakes</v>

624
00:27:39.661 --> 00:27:41.460
<v Speaker 1>and they've turned their life around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I completely,</v>

625
00:27:41.461 --> 00:27:42.300
<v Speaker 1>totally believe that.</v>

626
00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:44.760
<v Speaker 1>But then there's also cons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

627
00:27:44.850 --> 00:27:45.600
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

628
00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:49.890
<v Speaker 1>it's up to us to figure out who they are</v>
<v Speaker 1>and just experiment on them.</v>

629
00:27:49.891 --> 00:27:52.410
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're on your fourth trip to Aruba.</v>

630
00:27:52.411 --> 00:27:55.350
<v Speaker 1>Coming back by yourself even though you</v>
<v Speaker 1>and your girlfriend went,</v>

631
00:27:55.380 --> 00:27:58.210
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should get hooked up to your net.</v>

632
00:27:58.710 --> 00:28:00.190
<v Speaker 1>Why does it always happen in a room?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I know.</v>

633
00:28:00.330 --> 00:28:01.650
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>

634
00:28:01.710 --> 00:28:05.400
<v Speaker 1>Is it people saying no?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it girls turning guys down and the</v>

635
00:28:05.401 --> 00:28:08.010
<v Speaker 1>guys being mad?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it someone getting jealous?</v>

636
00:28:08.011 --> 00:28:11.100
<v Speaker 1>Is it just cycled?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Last one was a guy who met a girl online</v>

637
00:28:11.101 --> 00:28:13.080
<v Speaker 1>fluor to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're on vacation.</v>

638
00:28:13.081 --> 00:28:15.120
<v Speaker 1>His girlfriend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His most recent missing.</v>

639
00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:16.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

640
00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:18.450
<v Speaker 1>That I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he might've said that she's</v>

641
00:28:18.451 --> 00:28:20.700
<v Speaker 1>probably dead now for that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said she's dead.</v>

642
00:28:20.790 --> 00:28:21.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

643
00:28:21.570 --> 00:28:24.660
<v Speaker 1>but I would just any girl listening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if anyone says we should go on our</v>

644
00:28:24.661 --> 00:28:27.640
<v Speaker 1>senior trip or maybe go to Aruba,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

645
00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:28.980
<v Speaker 1>there's other areas you could go.</v>

646
00:28:29.580 --> 00:28:32.370
<v Speaker 1>So weird man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that is something that girls have to</v>

647
00:28:32.371 --> 00:28:34.950
<v Speaker 1>really worry about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have to worry about being killed by</v>

648
00:28:34.951 --> 00:28:36.870
<v Speaker 1>a guy like that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>

649
00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:39.840
<v Speaker 1>that's a possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a rare possibility.</v>

650
00:28:40.170 --> 00:28:42.870
<v Speaker 1>But out of the 300 million people in</v>
<v Speaker 1>this country,</v>

651
00:28:42.871 --> 00:28:45.510
<v Speaker 1>that's a big number.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every now and then one or two is going</v>

652
00:28:45.511 --> 00:28:47.670
<v Speaker 1>to pop up and God damn is it</v>
<v Speaker 1>heartbreaking.</v>

653
00:28:47.910 --> 00:28:52.710
<v Speaker 1>Some fucking person who's attracted to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the opposite sex but doesn't get what he</v>

654
00:28:52.711 --> 00:28:57.711
<v Speaker 1>wants so often and it's so psychopathic</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he becomes angry at women and wants</v>

655
00:28:58.441 --> 00:29:01.170
<v Speaker 1>to kill them and they're out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're out there.</v>

656
00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:04.820
<v Speaker 1>Can you shed any city you go to like</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vegas or Cam?</v>

657
00:29:05.210 --> 00:29:09.000
<v Speaker 1>Girls let their guard down and I'll see</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe because I'm older now and just</v>

658
00:29:09.001 --> 00:29:11.430
<v Speaker 1>about all of them could maybe be a dawn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not,</v>

659
00:29:11.431 --> 00:29:13.290
<v Speaker 1>not really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you look and you see them,</v>

660
00:29:13.291 --> 00:29:14.430
<v Speaker 1>they're drunk and they're.</v>

661
00:29:14.690 --> 00:29:17.970
<v Speaker 1>And they think that bitchy voice that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have is going to be the protection.</v>

662
00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:19.800
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did that kind of.</v>

<v Speaker 1>And they're like in an alley in the</v>

665

666
00:29:27.121 --> 00:29:31.680

<v Speaker 1>children too.</v>

00:30:38.681 --> 00:30:39.850
<v Speaker 2>Other woman goes,</v>

<v Speaker 2>He just looked at or whatever like that.</v>

693
00:30:43.630 --> 00:30:46.660
<v Speaker 2>And then this juncture chick got into</v>
<v Speaker 2>the car and then they drove off and then</v>

<v Speaker 2>girl,</v>

698
00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:56.980
<v Speaker 2>but it was Kinda one of those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a moment where I could have stolen</v>

699
00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:01.030
<v Speaker 2>somebody's girlfriend recently if I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>that type of guy.</v>

<v Speaker 2>There's this girl at the gas station and</v>

702
00:31:06.731 --> 00:31:09.930
<v Speaker 2>she's got a tub of aloe about this big</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Vera.</v>

<v Speaker 2>The guy has one of those krautrock at</v>
<v Speaker 2>motorcycles and it was about 110 outside</v>

705
00:31:17.741 --> 00:31:20.860
<v Speaker 2>and she obviously Burton her leg on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>exhaust,</v>

706
00:31:21.550 --> 00:31:22.590
<v Speaker 2>so now they're,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sitting by the gas pumps,</v>

<v Speaker 2>the guys putting all this stuff on all</v>
<v Speaker 2>this aloe.</v>

709
00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:29.110
<v Speaker 2>He's got his leather jacket,</v>
<v Speaker 2>motorcycle.</v>

710
00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:32.890
<v Speaker 2>She looks so pissed like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we've all seen pissed off girls</v>

711
00:31:32.891 --> 00:31:35.400

713
00:31:38.870 --> 00:31:42.220
<v Speaker 2>And she got it and just set it down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if I was like one of those Douche</v>

714
00:31:42.221 --> 00:31:44.690

<v Speaker 2>all they would have had to done is this</v>

715
00:31:44.691 --> 00:31:48.130
<v Speaker 2>stick out my hand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like every moving go take my hand and</v>

00:31:48.131 --> 00:31:51.550
<v Speaker 2>put her in my jeep and drove away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That guy would have been left right</v>

717
00:31:51.551 --> 00:31:53.190
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's ridiculous that you would think</v>

718
00:31:53.191 --> 00:31:53.870
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

719
00:31:53.870 --> 00:31:54.390
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

720
00:31:54.390 --> 00:31:57.520
<v Speaker 4>What do you think you are overconfident?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You friendly?</v>

721
00:31:57.560 --> 00:31:58.800
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're like one of those guys like</v>

722
00:31:58.810 --> 00:32:00.010

<v Speaker 4>She's going to turn around and look at</v>

723
00:32:00.011 --> 00:32:00.844
<v Speaker 4>me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

724
00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:03.640
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The deal is</v>

725
00:32:05.470 --> 00:32:07.520
<v Speaker 4>I had a car though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She doesn't have.</v>

726
00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:12.660
<v Speaker 4>Didn't have to get back on that moment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Probably when the girl is putting aloe</v>

727
00:32:13.731 --> 00:32:15.490
<v Speaker 4>and ice on the inside of her leg.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

728
00:32:15.730 --> 00:32:18.700
<v Speaker 4>That's what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could have sold a right then you're</v>

729
00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:22.750
<v Speaker 4>delusional.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My hand could have been a very good</v>

730
00:32:22.751 --> 00:32:25.660
<v Speaker 4>relationship and a guy just got a</v>
<v Speaker 4>motorcycle.</v>

731
00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:28.990
<v Speaker 4>Motorcycles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They had a great time riding together</v>

732
00:32:28.991 --> 00:32:33.100
<v Speaker 4>and unfortunately she burned her leg,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but she loves him and she loves being</v>

733
00:32:33.101 --> 00:32:36.010
<v Speaker 4>with the look on her.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just come along and like my hand.</v>

734
00:32:36.530 --> 00:32:38.890
<v Speaker 4>I would have said it way better words</v>
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>

735
00:32:38.900 --> 00:32:42.400
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

736
00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:47.400

<v Speaker 4>I could have said no,</v>

737
00:32:47.420 --> 00:32:48.710
<v Speaker 4>you need something better than that.</v>

738
00:32:49.130 --> 00:32:52.070
<v Speaker 4>But that would have been the time we</v>
<v Speaker 4>have four wheels.</v>

739
00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:52.940
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:56.290
<v Speaker 4>He was being nice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He brought a rose.</v>

<v Speaker 4>person.</v>

743
00:32:58.221 --> 00:33:01.160

<v Speaker 4>of relieved that mistake and you come</v>

744
00:33:01.161 --> 00:33:03.170

<v Speaker 3>That fit while being stoned.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the best for the double.</v>

757
00:33:33.730 --> 00:33:37.640
<v Speaker 3>A level double level cartoon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's called adventure time and it's just</v>

758
00:33:37.641 --> 00:33:38.550
<v Speaker 3>ventured time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

759
00:33:38.580 --> 00:33:43.580
<v Speaker 3>it is the most ridiculous fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>cartoon I've ever seen in my life and</v>

760
00:33:44.001 --> 00:33:46.970
<v Speaker 3>I'm so addicted to it and it's great for</v>
<v Speaker 3>kids.</v>

761
00:33:46.971 --> 00:33:50.240
<v Speaker 3>Kids will just fucking sit there and</v>
<v Speaker 3>love it today because it's all about</v>

762
00:33:50.241 --> 00:33:54.830
<v Speaker 3>princesses and princes and adventures</v>
<v Speaker 3>with dragons and horses.</v>

763
00:33:54.980 --> 00:33:58.250
<v Speaker 3>But it is trippy as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is it on a,</v>

764
00:33:58.251 --> 00:34:00.080
<v Speaker 3>it's on cartoon network.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's on all the time.</v>

765
00:34:00.081 --> 00:34:02.900
<v Speaker 3>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just dvr it like a schedule it and I</v>

766
00:34:02.901 --> 00:34:04.760
<v Speaker 3>think I got seven yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

767
00:34:06.370 --> 00:34:07.710
<v Speaker 3>is it an animation one or.</v>

768
00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:08.930
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's animation.</v>

769
00:34:08.931 --> 00:34:11.690
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of put to the same animation</v>
<v Speaker 3>styles that game called Catamari,</v>

770
00:34:11.691 --> 00:34:16.340
<v Speaker 3>but it's very simple but very trippy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a lot of dragons and swords.</v>

771
00:34:16.341 --> 00:34:18.320
<v Speaker 3>And when you say that it works on both</v>
<v Speaker 3>levels of the,</v>

772
00:34:18.321 --> 00:34:22.560
<v Speaker 3>like peewee's playhouse kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but not the new peewee's playhouse?</v>

773
00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:26.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have to have it on showtime and</v>

774
00:34:26.531 --> 00:34:28.700
<v Speaker 3>that he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what he did is he did like a live thing</v>

775
00:34:28.701 --> 00:34:29.491
<v Speaker 3>throughout,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

776
00:34:29.491 --> 00:34:31.550
<v Speaker 3>like Los Angeles for a while and then he</v>
<v Speaker 3>took it on the road.</v>

777
00:34:31.551 --> 00:34:35.210
<v Speaker 3>I think he went to New York and he had</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a live show of the playhouse and</v>

778
00:34:35.211 --> 00:34:37.220
<v Speaker 3>they filmed it for I think showtime or</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hbo.</v>

779
00:34:37.580 --> 00:34:42.380
<v Speaker 3>But I try watching it and it's like</v>
<v Speaker 3>completely a weird.</v>

780
00:34:42.381 --> 00:34:43.850
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it weird because you know he was</v>

781
00:34:43.851 --> 00:34:45.760
<v Speaker 3>beating off in a movie theater watching?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

782
00:34:45.770 --> 00:34:49.370
<v Speaker 3>it's weird because it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like he still looks pretty good,</v>

783
00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:51.020
<v Speaker 3>like he still looks pretty much like</v>
<v Speaker 3>peewee,</v>

784
00:34:51.021 --> 00:34:53.840
<v Speaker 3>but it's just off a teeny bit where</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

785
00:34:53.841 --> 00:34:55.640

<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

790
00:35:02.870 --> 00:35:04.580
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of weird.</v>

791

794
00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:17.960
<v Speaker 4>To have the video of him on his tongue</v>
<v Speaker 4>out slow motion.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Dick away and get up.</v>

796
00:35:22.190 --> 00:35:24.740
<v Speaker 4>Why would you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You would have been even bigger than he</v>

797
00:35:24.741 --> 00:35:27.680
<v Speaker 4>was proud of him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know,</v>

00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:29.840
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well that's the funny thing about that.</v>

799
00:35:29.841 --> 00:35:31.610
<v Speaker 4>A lot of times when things like that</v>
<v Speaker 4>happen,</v>

800
00:35:31.611 --> 00:35:34.760
<v Speaker 4>there's a backlash,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was sort of like an anti backlash</v>

801
00:35:34.761 --> 00:35:36.620
<v Speaker 4>with peewee Herman.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They like liked him more,</v>

802
00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:38.040
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>now he</v>

803
00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:41.640
<v Speaker 1>would have made more money if you go in</v>
<v Speaker 1>route and you know why they liked him</v>

804
00:35:41.641 --> 00:35:45.840
<v Speaker 1>more because he's gay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a gay guy that got caught jerking</v>

805
00:35:45.841 --> 00:35:48.610
<v Speaker 1>off in public.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is my theory and he was he a</v>

806
00:35:48.620 --> 00:35:50.610
<v Speaker 1>straight guy that got caught jerking off</v>
<v Speaker 1>in public.</v>

807
00:35:50.611 --> 00:35:52.890
<v Speaker 1>It might be a little more creepy because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a gay guy,</v>

808
00:35:52.891 --> 00:35:54.790
<v Speaker 1>like poor little fella got nowhere to</v>
<v Speaker 1>beat off.</v>

809
00:35:57.710 --> 00:36:00.770
<v Speaker 1>It can't be open about it and he's got</v>
<v Speaker 1>to go watch string people.</v>

810
00:36:00.780 --> 00:36:03.420
<v Speaker 1>Fuck and concentrate on the Dicks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

811
00:36:03.421 --> 00:36:05.700
<v Speaker 1>can't even go to a gay place because</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's famous.</v>

812
00:36:06.270 --> 00:36:07.150
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when that happened though,</v>

813
00:36:07.151 --> 00:36:09.640
<v Speaker 2>didn't he lose his show and actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>knocked him,</v>

814
00:36:09.670 --> 00:36:11.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was really popular.</v>

815
00:36:11.321 --> 00:36:14.740
<v Speaker 2>That happened and then people took,</v>
<v Speaker 2>took them off to shell lake.</v>

816
00:36:14.741 --> 00:36:17.260
<v Speaker 2>So we kind of lost it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I might not know what the fuck I'm</v>

817
00:36:17.261 --> 00:36:19.390
<v Speaker 2>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about what happened in the</v>

818
00:36:19.391 --> 00:36:20.530
<v Speaker 2>court of public opinion</v>

819
00:36:20.770 --> 00:36:23.230
<v Speaker 1>maybe in the financial world that</v>
<v Speaker 1>devastated him.</v>

820
00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:24.640
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the court of public</v>
<v Speaker 1>opinion.</v>

821
00:36:24.641 --> 00:36:27.090
<v Speaker 1>I felt like he did better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what other shows.</v>

822
00:36:27.130 --> 00:36:29.620
<v Speaker 1>Did he have a show still?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it was not that.</v>

823
00:36:29.621 --> 00:36:32.760
<v Speaker 1>It was a long ass time ago that when was</v>
<v Speaker 1>the last movie?</v>

824
00:36:32.830 --> 00:36:35.260
<v Speaker 1>House was on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had the two movies that came after</v>

825
00:36:35.950 --> 00:36:36.401
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

826
00:36:36.401 --> 00:36:39.730
<v Speaker 1>this was probably in the late eighties</v>
<v Speaker 1>where he got arrested.</v>

827
00:36:40.310 --> 00:36:41.530
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like we're at its height of</v>

<v Speaker 1>sign from some dudes.</v>

907
00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:01.750
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to punch the screen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's 100 times better than that show</v>

<v Speaker 1>and that was all the went down through.</v>

922
00:40:39.540 --> 00:40:41.970
<v Speaker 1>All creeps right in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They all have an expert.</v>

923
00:40:41.980 --> 00:40:42.431
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

924
00:40:42.431 --> 00:40:45.640
<v Speaker 1>luckily I called the expert of 18,</v>
<v Speaker 1>22 bullets.</v>

925
00:40:45.641 --> 00:40:48.130
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't punch punc guys don't have a</v>

926
00:40:48.131 --> 00:40:51.490
<v Speaker 1>team of experts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most pawn shop guys are kind of creepy,</v>

927
00:40:51.491 --> 00:40:52.324
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

928
00:40:53.860 --> 00:40:58.390
<v Speaker 1>But I've known about pawn shops is pool</v>
<v Speaker 1>hall dudes who always would sell stolen</v>

929
00:40:58.391 --> 00:40:59.620
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The pawn shops.</v>

930
00:40:59.830 --> 00:41:01.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't have a guy going in there</v>

931
00:41:01.631 --> 00:41:05.110
<v Speaker 1>showing you trying to sell pool cues to</v>
<v Speaker 1>buy crack and I know I do do it.</v>

932
00:41:05.111 --> 00:41:07.780
<v Speaker 1>A housekeeper and they caught the</v>
<v Speaker 1>housekeeper selling shit.</v>

933
00:41:07.781 --> 00:41:10.300
<v Speaker 1>The pawn shops,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they found a shit at trace some of them.</v>

934
00:41:10.301 --> 00:41:13.050
<v Speaker 1>One of their things and turned out it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was sold at a certain punch up there</v>

935
00:41:13.060 --> 00:41:15.220
<v Speaker 1>fucking housekeeper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're stealing their shit and bringing</v>

936
00:41:15.221 --> 00:41:18.570
<v Speaker 1>it to pawnshops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Shit Dude.</v>

937
00:41:18.910 --> 00:41:23.260
<v Speaker 1>Can you imagine having a pawn shot that</v>
<v Speaker 1>was also a check cashing place and how</v>

938
00:41:23.270 --> 00:41:26.390
<v Speaker 1>much that would be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'd be robbed and.</v>

939
00:41:26.391 --> 00:41:29.230
<v Speaker 1>Well they give you a cashier so it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>technically actually it'd be the wrong</v>

940
00:41:29.231 --> 00:41:32.290
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You will want to check crush in place</v>

941
00:41:32.291 --> 00:41:33.740
<v Speaker 1>there now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's like</v>

942
00:41:34.190 --> 00:41:37.730
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just a all for one and I don't have</v>

943
00:41:37.731 --> 00:41:38.590
<v Speaker 3>any money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

944
00:41:39.330 --> 00:41:42.710
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my dad does not go to cash checking</v>

945
00:41:42.711 --> 00:41:45.860
<v Speaker 3>places or pawn shops.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it seems like the people,</v>

946
00:41:45.861 --> 00:41:48.200
<v Speaker 3>the clientele,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those two places seem like they would</v>

947
00:41:48.201 --> 00:41:51.590
<v Speaker 3>enjoy a place that they can go to do</v>
<v Speaker 3>both if they have to.</v>

948
00:41:51.740 --> 00:41:54.080
<v Speaker 3>I guess that makes sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't make sense because it's</v>

949
00:41:54.081 --> 00:41:56.120
<v Speaker 3>two totally different things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you're totally broke.</v>

950
00:41:56.121 --> 00:41:58.700
<v Speaker 3>You have no money coming in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you sell a stolen TV.</v>

951
00:41:59.090 --> 00:42:01.910
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>To cash.</v>

952
00:42:01.940 --> 00:42:06.940
<v Speaker 3>Because my time is spent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll give everything in a bar on one.</v>

953
00:42:07.610 --> 00:42:09.200
<v Speaker 3>Didn't you say you got your dad?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hi once</v>

954
00:42:11.730 --> 00:42:12.920
<v Speaker 3>talking about that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

955
00:42:13.170 --> 00:42:17.310
<v Speaker 3>I didn't get them high.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just saw it was when I had a thing of</v>

956
00:42:17.690 --> 00:42:22.100
<v Speaker 3>weed soda and it tastes like Cola and he</v>
<v Speaker 3>was like,</v>

957
00:42:22.101 --> 00:42:23.060
<v Speaker 3>you're already taking a drink.</v>

958
00:42:23.060 --> 00:42:25.340
<v Speaker 3>And I gave him some weed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Soda.</v>

959
00:42:25.670 --> 00:42:30.470
<v Speaker 3>Do you ever know what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was having a great time laughing and</v>

960
00:42:30.471 --> 00:42:32.300
<v Speaker 3>telling funny stories and giggling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>

961
00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:36.290
<v Speaker 3>it was awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you tell him you tell him that you</v>

962
00:42:36.291 --> 00:42:39.860
<v Speaker 3>could have a day like this everyday now</v>
<v Speaker 3>because we were drinking wine also.</v>

963
00:42:39.861 --> 00:42:40.880
<v Speaker 3>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

964
00:42:40.890 --> 00:42:42.670
<v Speaker 3>I think he just probably thought that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow,</v>

965
00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:45.730
<v Speaker 3>that was something good wine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why don't you just tell him that gave</v>

966
00:42:45.740 --> 00:42:48.290
<v Speaker 3>him some weed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Soda will come on man.</v>

967
00:42:48.430 --> 00:42:51.200
<v Speaker 3>That's great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now why do you think that generation?</v>

968
00:42:52.010 --> 00:42:53.060
<v Speaker 3>Why don't you tell him?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>

969
00:42:53.300 --> 00:42:55.400
<v Speaker 3>Why don't you tell Him Dad?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had a great time because you were,</v>

970
00:42:55.770 --> 00:42:59.100

<v Speaker 3>I'm going to start going to coffee bean.</v>

989
00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:47.210
<v Speaker 3>Any major company has to do it for</v>
<v Speaker 3>insurance reasons though.</v>

990
00:43:47.370 --> 00:43:48.230
<v Speaker 3>Not really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

991
00:43:48.231 --> 00:43:48.611
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

992
00:43:48.611 --> 00:43:49.550
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

993
00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:52.490
<v Speaker 3>it's like a rule,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

994
00:43:52.491 --> 00:43:53.324
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

995
00:43:53.540 --> 00:43:57.380
<v Speaker 3>for most big companies that their</v>
<v Speaker 3>insurances are so high that they have to</v>

996
00:43:57.381 --> 00:43:58.214
<v Speaker 3>do shit like that.</v>

997
00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:01.010
<v Speaker 1>At the starbucks where I worked as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>Barista,</v>

998
00:44:01.011 --> 00:44:05.920
<v Speaker 1>there was no drug testing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No drug testing was ever performed.</v>

999
00:44:06.430 --> 00:44:08.890
<v Speaker 1>Thing is working at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it certainly did not do random drug</v>

1000
00:44:08.891 --> 00:44:12.910
<v Speaker 1>testing either as far as drug testing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you get injured while working.</v>

1001
00:44:12.911 --> 00:44:16.960
<v Speaker 1>I do not know what the policy is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but starbucks is not really a laid back</v>

1002
00:44:16.961 --> 00:44:17.794
<v Speaker 1>place to work.</v>

1003
00:44:18.890 --> 00:44:19.723
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1004
00:44:20.120 --> 00:44:21.150
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well starbucks doesn't.</v>

1005
00:44:21.240 --> 00:44:25.220
<v Speaker 3>But what the fuck kind of places do</v>
<v Speaker 3>though?</v>

1006
00:44:25.221 --> 00:44:28.760
<v Speaker 3>When I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I worked for Brian saying that</v>

1007
00:44:28.761 --> 00:44:31.520
<v Speaker 3>starbucks does to work as a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>Burrito</v>

1008

<v Speaker 3>don't say stipe miocic invoke with</v>

1009
00:44:36.921 --> 00:44:39.290
<v Speaker 3>starbucks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I was talking about is most</v>

1010
00:44:39.291 --> 00:44:42.410
<v Speaker 3>companies nowadays do require drug</v>
<v Speaker 3>testings.</v>

1011
00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:45.800
<v Speaker 3>I worked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I worked at a lot of places.</v>

1012
00:44:45.801 --> 00:44:49.820
<v Speaker 3>Joe Not long ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>seven years ago I was waiting tables.</v>

1013
00:44:49.910 --> 00:44:51.980
<v Speaker 3>I worked at a lot of companies that drug</v>
<v Speaker 3>tested.</v>

1014
00:44:51.981 --> 00:44:55.550
<v Speaker 3>I had to do it all the time and they got</v>
<v Speaker 3>some terrible news today,</v>

1015
00:44:55.551 --> 00:44:57.920
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fashion Irma's.</v>

1016

<v Speaker 3>percentage of companies drug tests</v>

1017
00:45:01.681 --> 00:45:04.250
<v Speaker 3>they're out of like the last five real</v>
<v Speaker 3>jobs I had,</v>

1018
00:45:04.251 --> 00:45:09.030
<v Speaker 3>I probably got drug tested at three of</v>
<v Speaker 3>those five jobs and these are defined</v>

1019
00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:12.320
<v Speaker 3>divine search search by going what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fortune 500 because they would have the</v>

1020

<v Speaker 3>money to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not.</v>

1021
00:45:15.021 --> 00:45:16.670
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's pretty normal for companies that</v>

1022
00:45:16.671 --> 00:45:18.690
<v Speaker 3>drug test outside of California.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It.</v>

1023
00:45:19.070 --> 00:45:22.940
<v Speaker 3>That's all I'm saying is that I wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>saying starbucks as starbucks.</v>

1024
00:45:22.970 --> 00:45:24.800
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying companies like starbucks and</v>
<v Speaker 3>things like that.</v>

1025
00:45:24.830 --> 00:45:26.310
<v Speaker 3>Main major companies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Are you ready for reality?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Major Laboratory testing company offered</v>

1028
00:45:32.761 --> 00:45:35.460
<v Speaker 1>the cheery news recently that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>percentage of American workers who</v>

1029
00:45:35.461 --> 00:45:38.970
<v Speaker 1>tested positive for illegal drugs last</v>
<v Speaker 1>year was the lowest ever.</v>

1030
00:45:39.900 --> 00:45:43.380
<v Speaker 1>So people are testing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The cheery news is that</v>

1031
00:45:43.430 --> 00:45:46.340
<v Speaker 3>people aren't used to be drug as much</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they're buying shit at waterbed</v>

1032
00:45:46.341 --> 00:45:50.260
<v Speaker 3>stores like myself called waterbeds and</v>
<v Speaker 3>company and it was a $20 talking about</v>

<v Speaker 3>$40 investment and people aren't</v>

1034
00:45:52.281 --> 00:45:54.530
<v Speaker 3>watching it.</v>

1035
00:45:54.590 --> 00:45:57.890
<v Speaker 3>that he's as good news that people</v>

00:46:11.331 --> 00:46:13.640
<v Speaker 3>There's a place called water beds and</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff in Ohio.</v>

1042
00:46:14.390 --> 00:46:17.030
<v Speaker 3>Didn't expect anyone else to know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was explaining it.</v>

1043
00:46:17.031 --> 00:46:18.470
<v Speaker 3>Then you stopped when you were.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

<v Speaker 3>drug test.</v>

1050
00:46:34.551 --> 00:46:38.330

00:47:05.291 --> 00:47:07.420
<v Speaker 3>get tested drug tested before you get</v>
<v Speaker 3>the welfare check.</v>

1063
00:47:07.660 --> 00:47:08.950
<v Speaker 3>Ninety eight percent passed.</v>

00:47:16.631 --> 00:47:21.631
<v Speaker 1>resource management found that 84</v>
<v Speaker 1>percent of employers required new hires</v>

1067
00:47:23.560 --> 00:47:26.140
<v Speaker 1>to hirees to pass drug screenings.</v>

1068
00:47:27.770 --> 00:47:29.460
<v Speaker 3>Sad.</v>

<v Speaker 1>hired.</v>

1071
00:47:34.601 --> 00:47:37.900
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In addition,</v>

1072
00:47:37.901 --> 00:47:42.901
<v Speaker 1>73 percent tested workers when drug use</v>
<v Speaker 1>was suspected and 58 percent required</v>

1073
00:47:44.651 --> 00:47:47.320
<v Speaker 1>testing after accidents on the job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

<v Speaker 4>trouble.</v>

1076
00:47:52.660 --> 00:47:54.580
<v Speaker 4>That is a horrible thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1077
00:47:55.180 --> 00:47:57.790
<v Speaker 1>Eighty four percent of employers were</v>
<v Speaker 1>crying.</v>

1078
00:47:57.820 --> 00:48:01.570
<v Speaker 1>We're crying paper to take drug tests.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>

1079
00:48:02.140 --> 00:48:05.080

<v Speaker 1>That's so discriminatory.</v>

1080
00:48:06.110 --> 00:48:07.900
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially for things that stay in your</v>

1081
00:48:07.901 --> 00:48:10.240
<v Speaker 1>system but aren't as damaging.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we'd.</v>

1082
00:48:10.420 --> 00:48:13.390
<v Speaker 1>Whereas cocaine is out of your system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You take it on a Friday,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you'll pass a drug test on a Monday.</v>

1084
00:48:15.620 --> 00:48:18.490
<v Speaker 1>It's a quick thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gets out of your system quick unless</v>

1085
00:48:18.491 --> 00:48:20.830
<v Speaker 1>I think they test your hair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if they test your hair,</v>

1086
00:48:20.831 --> 00:48:22.000
<v Speaker 1>they can find it a little longer</v>

1087
00:48:22.050 --> 00:48:24.780
<v Speaker 3>and at the waterbed store they have a</v>
<v Speaker 3>shampoo that you put on their hair if</v>

1088
00:48:24.781 --> 00:48:26.550
<v Speaker 3>they do test your hair and that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>really.</v>

1089
00:48:26.590 --> 00:48:29.100
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy that this water pet store in</v>
<v Speaker 3>Columbus,</v>

1090

<v Speaker 3>Ohio,</v>
<v Speaker 3>still in business and waterbed,</v>

1091
00:48:33.020 --> 00:48:35.290
<v Speaker 4>not waterbed and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love that store.</v>

1092
00:48:35.291 --> 00:48:37.930
<v Speaker 4>I love water beds and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You got to go do it.</v>

1093
00:48:37.931 --> 00:48:41.170
<v Speaker 4>Next time you're in Ohio,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think I do pass on that stupid</v>

1094

<v Speaker 4>They have shipper.</v>

1095
00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:44.670
<v Speaker 4>Every drug test.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your waterbed would actually smelled</v>

1096
00:48:44.671 --> 00:48:47.170
<v Speaker 4>like bong water and be kind of crappy to</v>
<v Speaker 4>sleep or the water.</v>

1097
00:48:47.830 --> 00:48:51.110
<v Speaker 4>The worst thing ever is you have a</v>
<v Speaker 4>waterbed and the power goes out and then</v>

1098
00:48:51.190 --> 00:48:55.810
<v Speaker 4>waterbeds not hot anymore and it fucking</v>
<v Speaker 4>polls heat off your body like you don't</v>

1099
00:48:55.811 --> 00:48:58.390
<v Speaker 4>realize.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's actually kind of dangerous man.</v>

1100
00:48:58.630 --> 00:49:00.340
<v Speaker 4>Like you don't want to have a black and</v>
<v Speaker 4>white,</v>

<v Speaker 4>but they suck for fucking.</v>

<v Speaker 3>the same time,</v>

<v Speaker 1>That was one of the greatest moments of</v>

1195
00:53:20.571 --> 00:53:22.460
<v Speaker 1>my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was one of the funniest things I've</v>

1196
00:53:22.461 --> 00:53:23.780
<v Speaker 1>ever seen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was alive at the time.</v>

1197
00:53:23.781 --> 00:53:24.770
<v Speaker 1>He was doing that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1198
00:53:24.830 --> 00:53:26.460
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we're on the Internet.</v>

1199
00:53:26.610 --> 00:53:29.910
<v Speaker 1>That's how all these videos are over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said there's a dump on.</v>

1200
00:53:29.911 --> 00:53:33.000
<v Speaker 1>I know when I did radio dump or.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh No.</v>

1201
00:53:33.001 --> 00:53:35.880
<v Speaker 1>So he doesn't have anything dumping when</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's online.</v>

1202
00:53:35.910 --> 00:53:38.580
<v Speaker 1>When he's online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The online version is uncensored,</v>

1203
00:53:38.610 --> 00:53:40.650

<v Speaker 1>live to like tons of radio.</v>

1205
00:53:42.931 --> 00:53:46.800
<v Speaker 1>That's why I told them where he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why I was on the first 45 minutes while</v>

1206
00:53:46.801 --> 00:53:48.030
<v Speaker 1>I was on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just me and him.</v>

1207
00:53:48.330 --> 00:53:50.040
<v Speaker 1>And then we will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 1>We're going to live on the internet,</v>

1209
00:53:52.381 --> 00:53:54.140
<v Speaker 1>but don't swear if you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's okay.</v>

1210
00:53:54.530 --> 00:53:56.820

<v Speaker 1>Say that I hope he's okay.</v>

1211

<v Speaker 1>and the fire is right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like Razah.</v>

1239
00:55:09.740 --> 00:55:12.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm driving to work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like 10:00 in the morning as I'm</v>

1240
00:55:12.511 --> 00:55:13.890
<v Speaker 1>going to work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like right down.</v>

1241
00:55:13.891 --> 00:55:14.724
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>It looks bad.</v>

1244
00:55:17.641 --> 00:55:20.160
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was a big fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm at work.</v>

1245
00:55:20.190 --> 00:55:23.580
<v Speaker 1>We're filming fear factor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We filmed for about three or four hours.</v>

1246
00:55:23.670 --> 00:55:26.970
<v Speaker 1>We get done with the stunt and we see</v>
<v Speaker 1>smoke coming over the mountain.</v>

1247
00:55:27.150 --> 00:55:32.150
<v Speaker 1>Now this is over an hour and a half of</v>
<v Speaker 1>driving 70 miles an hour.</v>

1248
00:55:32.820 --> 00:55:35.730
<v Speaker 1>The fire got to where I was and just a</v>
<v Speaker 1>few hours,</v>

1249
00:55:36.630 --> 00:55:39.240
<v Speaker 1>so I leave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get on the fucking highway and the</v>

1250
00:55:39.241 --> 00:55:43.200
<v Speaker 1>entire way home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole right side of the highway is</v>

1251
00:55:43.260 --> 00:55:48.260
<v Speaker 1>ablaze like a horror movie because it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>nighttime and it looks like a scene from</v>

1252
00:55:49.231 --> 00:55:51.900
<v Speaker 1>the Hobbit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I'm waiting for demons to come</v>

1253
00:55:52.030 --> 00:55:54.720
<v Speaker 1>riding black horses with fiery eyes.</v>

1254
00:55:54.950 --> 00:55:58.560
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's fucking terrifying man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I tried to take some photos.</v>

1255
00:55:58.561 --> 00:56:01.530
<v Speaker 1>I saw we also saw a dead guy there too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it talked about that.</v>

1256
00:56:01.860 --> 00:56:04.890
<v Speaker 1>So I got to get hit by a car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mac units actually saw one of the</v>

1257
00:56:04.920 --> 00:56:07.980
<v Speaker 1>producers of fear factor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He saw the guy's body.</v>

1258
00:56:07.981 --> 00:56:09.690
<v Speaker 1>He didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he actually saw the</v>

1259
00:56:09.691 --> 00:56:11.640
<v Speaker 1>impact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he just saw it right after it</v>

1260
00:56:11.641 --> 00:56:13.880
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought I felt somebody you hit one.</v>

1261
00:56:14.220 --> 00:56:17.010
<v Speaker 1>I still had that vision in my head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't try to want to cross the</v>

1262
00:56:17.011 --> 00:56:18.000

<v Speaker 6>what if a little fucking earthquake.</v>

<v Speaker 6>That's a wild ocean out there and the</v>
<v Speaker 6>ocean is just wild.</v>

1494
01:05:59.771 --> 01:06:01.210

<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's 60 percent or whatever.</v>

1496

<v Speaker 6>Baffles the fuck out of me since I was a</v>

<v Speaker 6>drowned as a kid in coney island and I</v>

<v Speaker 6>pull you into it.</v>

1515
01:06:48.580 --> 01:06:52.820
<v Speaker 6>Remember you look back and see your mom</v>

<v Speaker 6>you.</v>

<v Speaker 6>now you're caught in that fucking a.</v>

<v Speaker 6>it's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1520
01:07:02.980 --> 01:07:06.090
<v Speaker 6>scary actually when you're being pulled,</v>
<v Speaker 6>swim,</v>

1521
01:07:06.100 --> 01:07:07.120
<v Speaker 6>don't fight it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1522
01:07:07.260 --> 01:07:10.120
<v Speaker 6>grateful and save somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Some girl,</v>

1523
01:07:10.121 --> 01:07:13.480
<v Speaker 6>he was on vacation and Greg Fitzsimmons</v>
<v Speaker 6>is not like the most fit guy.</v>

1524
01:07:13.481 --> 01:07:16.540
<v Speaker 6>He's a small dude.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And he said some girl got pulled away by</v>

1525
01:07:16.541 --> 01:07:17.160
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>by the,</v>

1526
01:07:17.160 --> 01:07:19.240
<v Speaker 6>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And she started screaming and he</v>

1527
01:07:19.241 --> 01:07:20.800
<v Speaker 6>realized she couldn't swim very well and</v>
<v Speaker 6>he went,</v>

1528
01:07:20.830 --> 01:07:22.840
<v Speaker 6>oh fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And he had a moment to decide what to</v>

1529
01:07:22.841 --> 01:07:23.740
<v Speaker 6>do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And he jumped in.</v>

1530
01:07:24.370 --> 01:07:25.710
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>she didn't.</v>

1531
01:07:25.711 --> 01:07:28.630
<v Speaker 6>When he was there with his family.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You got to be careful about that man,</v>

1532
01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:29.530
<v Speaker 6>because you know what happens.</v>

1533
01:07:29.560 --> 01:07:32.350
<v Speaker 6>People drown you if you don't really</v>
<v Speaker 6>know how to rescue someone,</v>

1534
01:07:32.530 --> 01:07:34.960
<v Speaker 6>grab a hold of them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They panic and they drag you under.</v>

1535
01:07:35.590 --> 01:07:37.540
<v Speaker 6>That's fucking dangerous shit,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

1536
01:07:37.541 --> 01:07:39.550
<v Speaker 6>Rescuing someone.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's very hard to do.</v>

1537
01:07:39.670 --> 01:07:41.440
<v Speaker 6>You gotta really know what the fuck</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're doing.</v>

1538
01:07:41.470 --> 01:07:44.090
<v Speaker 6>That's about the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The first time I moved to California,</v>

1539
01:07:44.091 --> 01:07:47.290
<v Speaker 6>I went wake boarding.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We went out in the thing and a huge way,</v>

1540
01:07:47.291 --> 01:07:49.360
<v Speaker 6>but I missed it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I didn't know to go under,</v>

1541
01:07:49.420 --> 01:07:52.010
<v Speaker 6>I didn't know that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The board under in pop up,</v>

1542
01:07:52.011 --> 01:07:57.011
<v Speaker 6>so I rode so it took me nine feet in the</v>
<v Speaker 6>air and threw me backwards and then pin</v>

1543
01:07:57.101 --> 01:07:58.810
<v Speaker 6>me and ever since then I haven't done it</v>
<v Speaker 6>again.</v>

1544
01:07:58.830 --> 01:08:02.620
<v Speaker 6>We are too afraid to like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>cause I just got my ass kicked so bad</v>

<v Speaker 6>fucking mosquitoes.</v>

1548

<v Speaker 6>It's the worst thing you run into.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Got a pontoon boat.</v>

<v Speaker 7>they'll pick you the fuck up man.</v>

1552
01:08:21.360 --> 01:08:23.240
<v Speaker 7>Pick you to fuck up and put you</v>
<v Speaker 7>somewhere else.</v>

1553
01:08:23.241 --> 01:08:25.460
<v Speaker 7>They got those blanket.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Just Rub Bacon.</v>

1554
01:08:25.461 --> 01:08:26.294
<v Speaker 7>Milk</v>

1555
01:08:26.690 --> 01:08:28.460
<v Speaker 1>water on the east coast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to,</v>

1556
01:08:28.490 --> 01:08:31.070
<v Speaker 1>there was A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Charles River was near my house in the</v>

1557
01:08:31.071 --> 01:08:34.510
<v Speaker 1>east coast and I went into the bushes</v>
<v Speaker 1>one time with this chick and we're</v>

1558
01:08:34.520 --> 01:08:36.200
<v Speaker 1>fucking around and we had her pants</v>
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

1559
01:08:36.201 --> 01:08:39.230
<v Speaker 1>We had to stop because we're getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>bits so bad.</v>

1560
01:08:39.410 --> 01:08:42.050
<v Speaker 1>It's like our legs were just covered</v>
<v Speaker 1>with welts.</v>

1561
01:08:42.200 --> 01:08:45.830
<v Speaker 1>The mosquitoes just swarmed on you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They smell all that pink,</v>

1562
01:08:45.831 --> 01:08:49.460
<v Speaker 1>17 year old flesh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just dove on us.</v>

1563
01:08:49.461 --> 01:08:50.450
<v Speaker 1>It started fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1564
01:08:50.480 --> 01:08:53.150
<v Speaker 1>it was brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember the next day all my legs</v>

1565
01:08:53.151 --> 01:08:57.300
<v Speaker 1>covered in little tiny scabs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just got attacked by a swarm.</v>

1566
01:08:57.310 --> 01:09:00.230
<v Speaker 1>I still remember some of the worst</v>
<v Speaker 1>nights when that one mosquito would get</v>

1567
01:09:00.231 --> 01:09:02.540
<v Speaker 1>into your bedroom and your dad didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>put on the air,</v>

1568
01:09:02.541 --> 01:09:06.530
<v Speaker 1>so it was probably your sleeping and 85</v>
<v Speaker 1>year old weather and you just hear the</v>

1569
01:09:06.531 --> 01:09:11.531
<v Speaker 1>one fucking step one and you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rudel I rented a house once and nobody</v>

1570
01:09:14.181 --> 01:09:16.710
<v Speaker 1>had lived in the house for a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 1>years and uh,</v>

1571

<v Speaker 1>they had left all the water in the pool.</v>

1572
01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:22.220
<v Speaker 1>So I got there and the pool was fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>green man.</v>

<v Speaker 1>And I looked in it and I see like these</v>

<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

1585
01:09:52.310 --> 01:09:55.640
<v Speaker 1>So this has just been providing</v>
<v Speaker 1>mosquitoes to the entire community for</v>

1586
01:09:55.850 --> 01:09:58.460
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This big pool of mosquitoes,</v>

1587
01:09:58.461 --> 01:10:01.070

1588
01:10:01.071 --> 01:10:05.900
<v Speaker 1>gallons and gallons of poisoning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It took like two weeks to clean that</v>

1589
01:10:05.901 --> 01:10:09.170
<v Speaker 1>fucking thing out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had to pump the filter and pump all</v>

<v Speaker 1>the chlorine and gallons and gallons of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Korean.</v>

1591
01:10:12.110 --> 01:10:16.130
<v Speaker 1>Then drain all the water out because it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was too poisonous and put new water in</v>

1592
01:10:16.131 --> 01:10:20.180
<v Speaker 1>it it because you couldn't just drain it</v>

<v Speaker 7>the one made by all off was a wave.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It was a circle,</v>

1605
01:10:56.101 --> 01:10:58.230
<v Speaker 7>so when it burned at the end,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you knew you had to go in.</v>

1606
01:10:58.590 --> 01:11:01.110
<v Speaker 7>That's when you got to go in.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Now those mosquitoes,</v>

1607
01:11:01.111 --> 01:11:03.930
<v Speaker 7>that's like nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They're like fucking off.</v>

1608
01:11:03.960 --> 01:11:06.430
<v Speaker 7>You're going to put off on you.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They don't even advertise it no more.</v>

1609
01:11:06.431 --> 01:11:09.320
<v Speaker 7>I think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What happened off dot these mosquitoes.</v>

1610
01:11:09.400 --> 01:11:12.500
<v Speaker 7>Those don't even respect off no more.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's like off.</v>

1611
01:11:12.520 --> 01:11:13.830
<v Speaker 7>That's old bitch.</v>

1612
01:11:16.110 --> 01:11:21.110
<v Speaker 1>Don't go out until you got you got it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Smells like nobody uses off no more.</v>

1613
01:11:21.490 --> 01:11:23.970
<v Speaker 1>It's still there because I checked it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just people know that shit.</v>

1614
01:11:23.971 --> 01:11:25.650
<v Speaker 1>Don't worry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That'll even if it doesn't work,</v>

1615
01:11:25.651 --> 01:11:28.860
<v Speaker 1>it's probably poisonous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You pour in your pouring something on</v>

1616
01:11:28.861 --> 01:11:31.310
<v Speaker 1>your body that makes you unattractive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We use the spray.</v>

1617
01:11:32.570 --> 01:11:36.990
<v Speaker 1>Probably not good for you to fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>little skin is the biggest organ in your</v>

1618
01:11:36.991 --> 01:11:41.380
<v Speaker 1>body when you're spraying stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Says the man with tattoos all over his</v>

1619
01:11:42.060 --> 01:11:43.980
<v Speaker 1>fucking talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got increments.</v>

1620
01:11:44.010 --> 01:11:46.620
<v Speaker 1>Kin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but spraying anything on your skin like</v>

1621
01:11:46.630 --> 01:11:49.140
<v Speaker 1>Alexi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even sunscreen is going to be absorbed.</v>

1622
01:11:49.141 --> 01:11:50.460
<v Speaker 1>Those chemicals are going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>absorbed.</v>

1623
01:11:50.490 --> 01:11:53.670
<v Speaker 1>It's used to run behind the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There used to be a truck that is a</v>

1624
01:11:53.671 --> 01:11:54.370
<v Speaker 1>little bit older.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Me,</v>

1625
01:11:54.370 --> 01:11:57.210
<v Speaker 1>the truck would drive down the street</v>
<v Speaker 1>with just poison.</v>

1626
01:11:57.330 --> 01:12:00.420
<v Speaker 1>Shoot it into there to kill all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1627
01:12:00.420 --> 01:12:05.190
<v Speaker 1>I guess like maybe our grandparents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the kids used to follow it like an</v>

1628
01:12:05.191 --> 01:12:07.810
<v Speaker 1>ice cream truck and just run down the</v>
<v Speaker 1>street behind the smoke.</v>

1629
01:12:08.050 --> 01:12:11.070
<v Speaker 1>That's what I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some guys in my neighborhood,</v>

1630
01:12:11.071 --> 01:12:12.930
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the deal is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they're killing,</v>

1631
01:12:13.230 --> 01:12:16.740
<v Speaker 1>but they were walking around the other</v>
<v Speaker 1>day with fucking masks on their face</v>

1632
01:12:16.741 --> 01:12:21.480
<v Speaker 1>with these white suits on and they had</v>
<v Speaker 1>these little plastic spray jugs and</v>

1633
01:12:21.481 --> 01:12:23.190
<v Speaker 1>they're spraying this shit on the side</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the road.</v>

1634
01:12:23.191 --> 01:12:25.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck could you be spraying in</v>

1635
01:12:25.981 --> 01:12:29.370
<v Speaker 1>the road that I want you to spray on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>road while you're wearing a gas mask?</v>

1636
01:12:29.720 --> 01:12:31.590
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you have just an excess amount of</v>

1637
01:12:31.591 --> 01:12:35.140
<v Speaker 1>this shit need to kill weeds?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was somebody getting hayfever?</v>

1638
01:12:35.180 --> 01:12:36.030
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on man.</v>

1639
01:12:36.150 --> 01:12:37.440
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to hire somebody to cut it</v>

1640
01:12:37.441 --> 01:12:38.700
<v Speaker 1>down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're making new jobs,</v>

1641
01:12:38.701 --> 01:12:41.520
<v Speaker 1>but spraying poison on the side of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>road.</v>

1642
01:12:41.670 --> 01:12:45.210
<v Speaker 1>Is that really necessarily with who the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck says okay to that?</v>

1643
01:12:45.720 --> 01:12:48.390
<v Speaker 1>Isn't there laws against that shit?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are they doing?</v>

1644
01:12:48.930 --> 01:12:52.050
<v Speaker 1>You couldn't be bugs much and if they</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to still do it,</v>

1645
01:12:52.080 --> 01:12:52.831
<v Speaker 1>they must do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1646
01:12:52.831 --> 01:12:54.570
<v Speaker 1>I saw them do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what we mean,</v>

1647
01:12:54.660 --> 01:12:56.760
<v Speaker 1>what are they doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are they spraying and spraying for</v>

1648
01:12:56.761 --> 01:13:00.570
<v Speaker 1>weeds?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's mosquitoes scheme side of</v>

1649
01:13:00.571 --> 01:13:03.330
<v Speaker 1>the road and read about you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You right on the side of the road.</v>

1650
01:13:03.331 --> 01:13:06.480
<v Speaker 1>I think that in the middle of the night</v>
<v Speaker 1>it used to just a thing.</v>

1651
01:13:06.481 --> 01:13:08.430
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1652
01:13:08.550 --> 01:13:11.410
<v Speaker 1>I'd say weeds over bugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Weeds.</v>

1653
01:13:11.940 --> 01:13:13.440
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's bugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1654
01:13:13.441 --> 01:13:16.590
<v Speaker 1>There's no way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't have it or they don't really kill</v>

1655
01:13:16.591 --> 01:13:18.880
<v Speaker 1>that many bugs because the problem with</v>
<v Speaker 1>killing bugs,</v>

1656
01:13:18.881 --> 01:13:21.060
<v Speaker 1>it's some crazy ecosystem out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1657
01:13:21.061 --> 01:13:24.840
<v Speaker 1>There's a whole sort of a cycle too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you squash one thing like</v>

1658
01:13:24.841 --> 01:13:27.900
<v Speaker 1>mosquitoes or bugs did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might fuck up some other part of the</v>

1659
01:13:27.901 --> 01:13:29.130
<v Speaker 1>ecosystem along with it.</v>

1660
01:13:29.130 --> 01:13:31.140
<v Speaker 1>And my kill birds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see the guy,</v>

1661
01:13:31.141 --> 01:13:34.830
<v Speaker 1>there's a guy who made an entire</v>
<v Speaker 1>ecosystem in his house and that's how he</v>

1662
01:13:34.831 --> 01:13:39.831
<v Speaker 1>keeps spiders and flies away from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the exact number.</v>

1663
01:13:40.561 --> 01:13:44.430
<v Speaker 1>He has hundreds of different bugs</v>
<v Speaker 1>species that eat each other and he has</v>

1664
01:13:44.440 --> 01:13:46.560
<v Speaker 1>perimeters in his house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an entire.</v>

1665
01:13:46.650 --> 01:13:49.320
<v Speaker 1>So he leaves a flies but then the</v>
<v Speaker 1>spiders come and make the thing.</v>

1666
01:13:49.321 --> 01:13:51.230
<v Speaker 1>But then despite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or is it,</v>

1667
01:13:51.570 --> 01:13:53.370
<v Speaker 1>I saw it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he has an entire.</v>

1668
01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:57.100
<v Speaker 1>That's his bug system and they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he has perimeter set up and they</v>

1669
01:13:57.101 --> 01:13:59.850
<v Speaker 1>don't leave the perimeter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So by the time you were in his house,</v>

1670
01:14:00.060 --> 01:14:03.000
<v Speaker 1>nothing will look man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look at the animals that eat</v>

1671
01:14:03.001 --> 01:14:04.170
<v Speaker 1>other animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing,</v>

1672
01:14:04.180 --> 01:14:06.690
<v Speaker 1>but he's got it all figured out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sounded supposed to be set up.</v>

1673
01:14:07.240 --> 01:14:08.280
<v Speaker 1>So there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

1674
01:14:08.440 --> 01:14:11.470
<v Speaker 1>I guess if you paid attention to it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you find out what the prey and what</v>

1675
01:14:11.471 --> 01:14:12.010
<v Speaker 1>things eat</v>

1676
01:14:12.010 --> 01:14:15.940
<v Speaker 6>and what they get from everything.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He knows the whole system.</v>

1677
01:14:15.941 --> 01:14:17.100
<v Speaker 6>That's fascinating man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I want to.</v>

1678
01:14:17.110 --> 01:14:19.780
<v Speaker 6>How much effort he has to put into.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was crazy.</v>

1679
01:14:19.810 --> 01:14:22.390
<v Speaker 6>It was like a whole,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like something you'd see at a zoo,</v>

1680
01:14:22.450 --> 01:14:25.270
<v Speaker 6>like that's his life's work.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like a hip bone connected to the</v>

1681
01:14:25.271 --> 01:14:27.250
<v Speaker 6>joint bone.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like there's something always</v>

1682
01:14:27.251 --> 01:14:28.330
<v Speaker 6>fucking doing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1683
01:14:28.660 --> 01:14:30.460
<v Speaker 6>somebodies always eating somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1684
01:14:30.461 --> 01:14:31.990
<v Speaker 6>That's why I don't have hormones</v>
<v Speaker 6>anymore.</v>

1685
01:14:32.260 --> 01:14:34.180
<v Speaker 6>I had the personas are a pain in the ass</v>
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

1686
01:14:34.181 --> 01:14:35.860
<v Speaker 6>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you have to clean that tank like every</v>

1687
01:14:35.861 --> 01:14:37.960
<v Speaker 6>couple of days because they,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they eat massey.</v>

1688
01:14:38.500 --> 01:14:41.830
<v Speaker 6>It's exciting when they eat the messy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but they're only exciting when they're</v>

1689
01:14:41.831 --> 01:14:42.910
<v Speaker 6>eating,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when they're eating.</v>

1690
01:14:42.911 --> 01:14:46.240
<v Speaker 6>It's crazy to watch them and I would</v>
<v Speaker 6>feed them goldfish and they would go on</v>

1691
01:14:46.241 --> 01:14:48.970
<v Speaker 6>a rampage.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was incredible.</v>

1692
01:14:49.060 --> 01:14:51.070
<v Speaker 6>It was a goldfish.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You think you're going to some little</v>

1693
01:14:51.071 --> 01:14:53.800
<v Speaker 6>kid who's got an idea and you're going</v>
<v Speaker 6>to fly around the.</v>

1694
01:14:53.830 --> 01:14:57.150
<v Speaker 6>You know</v>
<v Speaker 6>what?</v>

1695
01:14:57.900 --> 01:15:00.910
<v Speaker 6>I would them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It traumatized me as a kid.</v>

1696
01:15:00.911 --> 01:15:03.080
<v Speaker 6>I used to fish for goldfish.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The goldfish in the New York.</v>

1697
01:15:03.130 --> 01:15:04.870
<v Speaker 6>The weirdest thing because you get to my</v>
<v Speaker 6>luggage and river,</v>

1698
01:15:04.871 --> 01:15:07.390
<v Speaker 6>which is murky.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You put them into clean water and they</v>

1699
01:15:07.391 --> 01:15:09.280
<v Speaker 6>died.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What the fuck?</v>

1700
01:15:09.281 --> 01:15:11.170
<v Speaker 6>You been living in that shit?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Water for 10 years.</v>

<v Speaker 6>I bring you home,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'll give you a love of Goldfish in the</v>

1702
01:15:14.210 --> 01:15:16.710
<v Speaker 6>central park.</v>
<v Speaker 6>When I was a kid in central park bench,</v>

1703
01:15:16.820 --> 01:15:19.540
<v Speaker 6>I'm just a little fucking thing or that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

01:15:19.541 --> 01:15:20.910
<v Speaker 6>there were probably part.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1705
01:15:20.911 --> 01:15:24.240
<v Speaker 6>You probably like the little paddle</v>
<v Speaker 6>boats and central park and you probably</v>

1706
01:15:24.250 --> 01:15:27.340
<v Speaker 6>know those are other goldfish.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Goldfish,</v>

1707
01:15:27.520 --> 01:15:29.390
<v Speaker 6>goldfish and go,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you don't want to catch nothing.</v>

1708
01:15:29.391 --> 01:15:32.230
<v Speaker 6>None of that fucking Hudson.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I seen a friend of mine either</v>

1709
01:15:32.310 --> 01:15:36.210
<v Speaker 7>eels heart one time on the Hudson.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I bet that motherfucker glowed in the</v>

1710
01:15:36.211 --> 01:15:41.211
<v Speaker 7>dark when I was a kid when I was a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It was funny because Puerto Rican lived</v>

1711
01:15:41.370 --> 01:15:45.480
<v Speaker 7>in the bronx and Brooklyn.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's so weird how the the nationality</v>

1712
01:15:45.481 --> 01:15:49.320
<v Speaker 7>thing goes,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but Puerto Rican big weekend out in the</v>

1713
01:15:49.320 --> 01:15:51.720

<v Speaker 7>If you watch cop land,</v>

1714
01:15:51.721 --> 01:15:54.810
<v Speaker 7>you catch the black people under the</v>
<v Speaker 7>bridge of salons,</v>

1715
01:15:54.811 --> 01:15:57.840
<v Speaker 7>given them a ticket and they're like,</v>

<v Speaker 7>to go to Jersey on the weekends.</v>

1719
01:16:06.240 --> 01:16:10.170
<v Speaker 7>How fucking crazy is that?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Puerto Ricans would drive over the</v>

<v Speaker 7>they had.</v>

01:16:41.110 --> 01:16:43.290
<v Speaker 7>They came from the fucking bronx in the</v>
<v Speaker 7>seventies,</v>

1736
01:16:50.200 --> 01:16:53.600
<v Speaker 7>Like people were throwing buildings and</v>
<v Speaker 7>cars and they're like,</v>

<v Speaker 6>you just look at any random stall at a</v>
<v Speaker 6>public restroom that's only 10 people</v>

<v Speaker 6>living your life with garbage out.</v>

1755
01:17:33.890 --> 01:17:36.830
<v Speaker 6>You know what that smells like after a</v>
<v Speaker 6>week or week,</v>

01:17:36.880 --> 01:17:41.090
<v Speaker 6>this fucking weather Japan to Harlem to</v>
<v Speaker 6>play one pocket.</v>

1757

<v Speaker 6>my friend Johnny B and Mount Vernon and</v>

01:17:43.251 --> 01:17:46.460
<v Speaker 6>Tommy and this dude won.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We all went to Harlem to play,</v>

1759
01:17:46.461 --> 01:17:47.330
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>some pimps,</v>

1760
01:17:47.690 --> 01:17:51.170
<v Speaker 6>pimps would be gambling,</v>
<v Speaker 6>playing pool and so they would spend a</v>

1761
01:17:51.171 --> 01:17:51.680
<v Speaker 6>lot of money.</v>

1762
01:17:51.680 --> 01:17:55.460
<v Speaker 6>So the word got out,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it was like 125th street in Harlem,</v>

1763
01:17:55.670 --> 01:17:58.160
<v Speaker 6>maybe even higher than that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We got there and there are apparently</v>

1764
01:17:58.161 --> 01:18:02.510
<v Speaker 6>some garbage strike and the garbage was</v>
<v Speaker 6>seven feet to eight feet high for a</v>

1765

<v Speaker 6>whole block.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean a whole block dude.</v>

1766
01:18:05.361 --> 01:18:07.700
<v Speaker 6>It was nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 6>People would just step outside and throw</v>

1767
01:18:07.701 --> 01:18:10.370
<v Speaker 6>the garbage on a pile and there was a</v>
<v Speaker 6>rat everywhere.</v>

1768
01:18:11.030 --> 01:18:14.300
<v Speaker 6>Every rentable,</v>
<v Speaker 6>because there's bags of food,</v>

1769
01:18:14.420 --> 01:18:16.190
<v Speaker 6>there's bags of things that rats can</v>
<v Speaker 6>eat.</v>

1770
01:18:16.340 --> 01:18:21.110
<v Speaker 6>I'm talking literally a block of eight</v>
<v Speaker 6>foot high piles of garbage.</v>

1771
01:18:21.260 --> 01:18:22.460
<v Speaker 6>It was horrifying,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

1772
01:18:22.850 --> 01:18:25.190
<v Speaker 6>My friends worked for hunt chemical and</v>
<v Speaker 6>it went to India.</v>

1773
01:18:25.191 --> 01:18:29.330
<v Speaker 6>They all got transferred to India and in</v>
<v Speaker 6>the early nineties they came back and</v>

1774
01:18:29.331 --> 01:18:31.830
<v Speaker 6>they were telling me stories about how</v>
<v Speaker 6>they don't kill rats there.</v>

1775
01:18:33.020 --> 01:18:36.810
<v Speaker 6>You pull up at night with your car,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know how you see a raccoon or a</v>

1776
01:18:36.820 --> 01:18:37.653
<v Speaker 6>fucking cat.</v>

01:18:37.760 --> 01:18:41.390
<v Speaker 6>It just be wrapped and your garbage.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You have to sit there for 10 minutes and</v>

1778
01:18:41.391 --> 01:18:44.330
<v Speaker 6>let them run out of the fucking garbage</v>
<v Speaker 6>before you get out of the car.</v>

1779
01:18:45.200 --> 01:18:46.940
<v Speaker 6>I can't deal with that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's just going to rap.</v>

1780
01:18:46.941 --> 01:18:48.710
<v Speaker 6>They found the bronx.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I know you've seen that.</v>

1781
01:18:48.711 --> 01:18:51.870
<v Speaker 6>I saw that fork now and how big the</v>
<v Speaker 6>fucking rat work.</v>

<v Speaker 6>They were a mess.</v>

1783
01:18:53.451 --> 01:18:55.580
<v Speaker 6>They said there's a lot of them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The guy looked at me and goes,</v>

1784
01:18:55.581 --> 01:18:57.650
<v Speaker 6>he thought it was kids in there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He thought it was like kids.</v>

1785
01:18:57.680 --> 01:18:59.300
<v Speaker 6>They will fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He pulled them out.</v>

1786
01:18:59.301 --> 01:19:00.980
<v Speaker 6>They were like a cat.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The back legs.</v>

1787
01:19:01.450 --> 01:19:04.570
<v Speaker 6>Cat picks his legs up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He had it like three feet.</v>

1788
01:19:04.610 --> 01:19:07.850
<v Speaker 6>What was the biggest rat I've ever seen</v>
<v Speaker 6>in my life?</v>

1789
01:19:07.851 --> 01:19:10.550
<v Speaker 6>It was fucking enormous.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's body looked like it was almost two</v>

1790
01:19:10.551 --> 01:19:12.080
<v Speaker 6>feet long.</v>
<v Speaker 6>His body,</v>

1791
01:19:12.081 --> 01:19:15.140
<v Speaker 6>his body was clearly more than a foot</v>
<v Speaker 6>long.</v>

1792
01:19:15.350 --> 01:19:17.330
<v Speaker 6>His body easily could have been a foot</v>
<v Speaker 6>and a half,</v>

1793
01:19:17.360 --> 01:19:20.780
<v Speaker 6>maybe even two feet long.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was a big rat and this guy said</v>

1794
01:19:20.781 --> 01:19:22.580
<v Speaker 6>there's a lot of them there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You said there was a lot of them.</v>

1795
01:19:22.630 --> 01:19:23.600
<v Speaker 6>That whole.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1796
01:19:23.601 --> 01:19:24.900
<v Speaker 6>it's so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like I,</v>

1797
01:19:25.020 --> 01:19:28.670
<v Speaker 6>I grew up on Adhd for awhile when I came</v>
<v Speaker 6>from Cuba and we would kill rats.</v>

1798
01:19:28.730 --> 01:19:29.551
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you chase her.</v>

1799
01:19:29.551 --> 01:19:31.160
<v Speaker 6>I hit him with a stick.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Light them on fire,</v>

1800
01:19:31.161 --> 01:19:34.520
<v Speaker 6>throw rocks at you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>make sure that motherfucker's dead.</v>

1801
01:19:35.060 --> 01:19:37.190
<v Speaker 6>Then I used to spend my summers on 140th</v>
<v Speaker 6>street.</v>

1802
01:19:37.230 --> 01:19:39.860
<v Speaker 6>My godmother had three buildings so I</v>
<v Speaker 6>could walk underneath.</v>

1803
01:19:40.370 --> 01:19:44.150
<v Speaker 6>I seen a rat under that one time that</v>
<v Speaker 6>his eyes was so fucking big.</v>

1804
01:19:45.050 --> 01:19:48.170
<v Speaker 6>His eyes are so fucking big that I was</v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

1805
01:19:48.440 --> 01:19:50.090

1806
01:19:50.091 --> 01:19:53.060
<v Speaker 6>at the La Jolla comedy store.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Fucking condo.</v>

1808
01:19:54.990 --> 01:19:56.860
<v Speaker 6>I packed my bags and got back on that</v>
<v Speaker 6>five.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I see the big wrap there.</v>

1810
01:19:59.361 --> 01:20:02.410

<v Speaker 6>God Damn it.</v>

1811
01:20:02.450 --> 01:20:05.390
<v Speaker 6>I can't deal with that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So fucking durable.</v>

1812
01:20:05.890 --> 01:20:10.410
<v Speaker 6>They can compress their body and get to</v>
<v Speaker 6>really small holes to like a big rat can</v>

1813
01:20:10.411 --> 01:20:13.590
<v Speaker 6>smush his body and get through a fairly</v>
<v Speaker 6>small fucking hall.</v>

1814
01:20:13.591 --> 01:20:17.520
<v Speaker 6>It's really kind of crazy to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's a fuck is you think guys back in</v>

1815
01:20:17.521 --> 01:20:18.780

1816
01:20:18.781 --> 01:20:23.570
<v Speaker 6>500 years ago were afraid of rats or</v>
<v Speaker 6>adidas looked at us food like we're</v>

1817
01:20:23.580 --> 01:20:25.440
<v Speaker 6>lucky that we don't have to deal with</v>
<v Speaker 6>the rats,</v>

1818
01:20:25.500 --> 01:20:28.750
<v Speaker 6>but it just mentally like it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're afraid and if you go back like</v>

1819
01:20:28.770 --> 01:20:31.650
<v Speaker 6>neanderthal days they were.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They didn't give a fuck about a rat.</v>

1820
01:20:31.680 --> 01:20:34.770
<v Speaker 6>Anything small digression.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I live up in the hills too and I have a</v>

1821
01:20:34.771 --> 01:20:36.690
<v Speaker 6>privacy fence and you'll see them just</v>
<v Speaker 6>running.</v>

1822
01:20:36.690 --> 01:20:41.080
<v Speaker 6>My dogs would try to it and then I'll</v>
<v Speaker 6>jump every time I see one and I'm like,</v>

1823

1824
01:20:43.430 --> 01:20:45.710
<v Speaker 6>I had to bring in exterminators.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I used to have them by Anik.</v>

1825
01:20:45.720 --> 01:20:46.970
<v Speaker 6>You would hear them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was like,</v>

1826
01:20:47.130 --> 01:20:50.130
<v Speaker 6>like literally like two dogs fighting up</v>
<v Speaker 6>there.</v>

<v Speaker 7>Boys don't drive.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You don't want the craziest thing.</v>

1943
01:25:40.220 --> 01:25:42.660
<v Speaker 7>We're going to hire someone to drive.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We'll get a little caught.</v>

1944
01:25:42.661 --> 01:25:45.120
<v Speaker 7>One of the craziest things I've Tequila.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Just kidding.</v>

1945
01:25:45.121 --> 01:25:48.590
<v Speaker 7>It depends what mood you're in.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If you drink enough tequila,</v>

1946
01:25:48.660 --> 01:25:50.580
<v Speaker 7>bro,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it becomes something different.</v>

1947
01:25:50.610 --> 01:25:53.340
<v Speaker 7>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It becomes a different animal than vodka</v>

1948
01:25:53.670 --> 01:25:57.170
<v Speaker 7>or Tequila is a kind of tricky mother.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't know if you motherfuckers ever</v>

1949
01:25:57.171 --> 01:25:58.970
<v Speaker 7>rate the warm.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I made a mistake one second,</v>

1950
01:25:59.210 --> 01:26:02.400
<v Speaker 7>but swapped and ate a warm Tequila.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Makes me,</v>

1951
01:26:02.401 --> 01:26:03.620
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think,</v>

1952
01:26:03.650 --> 01:26:04.483
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>

1953
01:26:04.520 --> 01:26:06.120
<v Speaker 4>there's a difference between Tequila</v>
<v Speaker 4>draw.</v>

1954
01:26:06.140 --> 01:26:07.450
<v Speaker 4>It sounds ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It does,</v>

1955
01:26:07.620 --> 01:26:09.650
<v Speaker 4>but it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And Sheila Drunk whiskey drunk.</v>

1956
01:26:09.680 --> 01:26:13.490
<v Speaker 4>Whiskey drunk is more like fucking</v>
<v Speaker 4>aggressive Tequila.</v>

1957
01:26:13.550 --> 01:26:16.270
<v Speaker 4>Tequila drunk is more like we've got to</v>
<v Speaker 4>find the vampires.</v>

1958
01:26:16.530 --> 01:26:19.130
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm angry.</v>

1959
01:26:19.140 --> 01:26:22.310
<v Speaker 4>I'm</v>
<v Speaker 4>angry on Tequila man.</v>

1960
01:26:22.311 --> 01:26:25.640
<v Speaker 4>But to Jack Daniels is questionable</v>
<v Speaker 4>choice.</v>

1961
01:26:25.700 --> 01:26:26.533
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you never seen it.</v>

1962

1963
01:26:28.290 --> 01:26:30.200

<v Speaker 4>I think a lot of it that you go into.</v>

1964
01:26:30.201 --> 01:26:35.060
<v Speaker 4>So if you think I'm an angry drunk and</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was dangerous and you start drinking</v>

1965
01:26:36.070 --> 01:26:40.070
<v Speaker 4>because you're weird reaction.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not an angry drunk though.</v>

1966
01:26:40.240 --> 01:26:44.450
<v Speaker 4>I don't believe in that shit entirely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like if you're an angry person</v>

1967
01:26:44.451 --> 01:26:46.250
<v Speaker 4>and you get drunk,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you become an angry drunk.</v>

1968
01:26:46.251 --> 01:26:49.430
<v Speaker 4>If you have some fucking resolved</v>
<v Speaker 4>issues,</v>

1969
01:26:49.730 --> 01:26:52.430
<v Speaker 4>then it become an angry drunk because</v>
<v Speaker 4>most of the people are not even ready.</v>

1970
01:26:52.430 --> 01:26:52.941
<v Speaker 4>Sing,</v>

<v Speaker 4>You become silly when you're drunk</v>

1974
01:26:58.980 --> 01:27:00.950
<v Speaker 4>because you're a silly person and it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>for you.</v>

<v Speaker 8>I'm well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>is this a company where the guy that</v>

2145
01:34:14.520 --> 01:34:16.620
<v Speaker 8>owns the company or is this an employee?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Hold on,</v>

2146
01:34:16.621 --> 01:34:18.630
<v Speaker 8>hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 8>The p thing is just one thing.</v>

2147
01:34:18.631 --> 01:34:21.180
<v Speaker 8>This looking at your wife,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you just glossed over.</v>

2148
01:34:21.540 --> 01:34:23.430
<v Speaker 8>Why don't you tell us a little bit more?</v>
<v Speaker 8>What is.</v>

2149
01:34:23.431 --> 01:34:24.880
<v Speaker 8>What is the reason for that?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>

2150
01:34:24.980 --> 01:34:25.801
<v Speaker 8>we don't.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>

2151
01:34:25.801 --> 01:34:28.590
<v Speaker 8>because if you stare at and he comes</v>
<v Speaker 8>early in the morning,</v>

2152
01:34:28.591 --> 01:34:31.650
<v Speaker 8>you can get a glimpse at 9:00 AM of</v>
<v Speaker 8>maybe her popping up.</v>

2153
01:34:31.680 --> 01:34:33.360
<v Speaker 8>Like why?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Why are you saying that?</v>

2154
01:34:33.390 --> 01:34:34.740
<v Speaker 8>Did he do that?</v>
<v Speaker 8>We,</v>

2155
01:34:34.920 --> 01:34:38.280
<v Speaker 8>she gets that feeling that he is,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but we've never actually caught.</v>

2156
01:34:38.281 --> 01:34:39.630
<v Speaker 8>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I think he stares.</v>

2157
01:34:39.631 --> 01:34:40.530
<v Speaker 8>I think he,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

2158
01:34:40.710 --> 01:34:42.050
<v Speaker 8>my wife doesn't sound like that once</v>
<v Speaker 8>she.</v>

2159
01:34:42.130 --> 01:34:43.920
<v Speaker 8>Why does she think stairs?</v>
<v Speaker 8>No evidence.</v>

2160
01:34:43.921 --> 01:34:46.920
<v Speaker 8>Just a guess.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Just thinking in that you'll see him</v>

2161
01:34:46.980 --> 01:34:48.440
<v Speaker 8>walk by.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So she's like,</v>

2162
01:34:48.470 --> 01:34:49.710
<v Speaker 8>was he just stay?</v>
<v Speaker 8>You don't,</v>

2163
01:34:49.740 --> 01:34:52.110
<v Speaker 8>we don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We should maybe just videotape it.</v>

2164
01:34:52.111 --> 01:34:56.100
<v Speaker 8>Wants to set up a camera and see if he</v>
<v Speaker 8>hangs out or if he pisses in my backyard</v>

2165
01:34:56.120 --> 01:34:57.950
<v Speaker 8>yard.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm at JC penny's and I see a black</v>
<v Speaker 1>Santa Claus at the mall or something.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I know it's,</v>

2212
01:36:56.630 --> 01:37:01.630
<v Speaker 1>to me it's got to be like the ultimate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a black man trying to be as like an</v>

2213
01:37:06.621 --> 01:37:09.830
<v Speaker 1>aggressive towards women as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the most,</v>

2214
01:37:10.040 --> 01:37:12.440
<v Speaker 1>the most unimpressive thing you can be</v>
<v Speaker 1>is be a woman.</v>

2215
01:37:12.470 --> 01:37:13.880
<v Speaker 1>Dress up like a woman.</v>

<v Speaker 1>pussy.</v>

2218
01:37:16.730 --> 01:37:20.000
<v Speaker 1>It's like the complete polar opposite of</v>
<v Speaker 1>what white people are afraid of in a</v>

2219
01:37:20.001 --> 01:37:21.110
<v Speaker 1>black guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2220

<v Speaker 1>white people are afraid of in a black</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy is a fucking big muscular black man</v>

2221

<v Speaker 1>woman.</v>

2223
01:37:32.810 --> 01:37:36.380

<v Speaker 1>What's a black man being all silly and</v>

2224
01:37:36.381 --> 01:37:37.940
<v Speaker 1>address dressing like a woman?</v>

<v Speaker 1>laid at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what it is.</v>

2231

<v Speaker 1>I think that's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to check.</v>

<v Speaker 6>A little bit of a black planet bitches.</v>

2234
01:38:00.540 --> 01:38:02.860
<v Speaker 6>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I get one point.</v>

2235
01:38:02.900 --> 01:38:06.000
<v Speaker 6>If it's a black dude,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I just can't.</v>

2236
01:38:06.030 --> 01:38:08.130
<v Speaker 6>What's wrong with you?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Because he doesn't have a black dick and</v>

2237
01:38:08.131 --> 01:38:11.300
<v Speaker 6>somebody can get into the fantasy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's nothing about me being raised.</v>

<v Speaker 6>I think it's gay.</v>

2239
01:38:12.631 --> 01:38:16.180
<v Speaker 6>If you watch a black guy fucking a white</v>
<v Speaker 6>chick if you're a white guy because.</v>

2240
01:38:16.200 --> 01:38:18.390
<v Speaker 6>Because now you can't even pretend that</v>
<v Speaker 6>to you.</v>

2241
01:38:19.190 --> 01:38:20.280
<v Speaker 6>See,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you're a white guy,</v>

2242
01:38:20.281 --> 01:38:24.260
<v Speaker 6>you can pretend that your desk,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you could beat off and watch a girl give</v>

2243
01:38:24.261 --> 01:38:27.210
<v Speaker 6>head and pretend that she's given you 10</v>
<v Speaker 6>shit.</v>

<v Speaker 6>He's like,</v>

2506
01:49:30.991 --> 01:49:32.850
<v Speaker 6>I can catch this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and he just couldn't.</v>

2507
01:49:32.851 --> 01:49:35.550
<v Speaker 6>Couldn't get it going man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Having a knee tear and then trying to</v>

2508
01:49:35.551 --> 01:49:38.700
<v Speaker 6>fight a guy like Jacob Brian,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a fucking professional mixed martial</v>

2509
01:49:38.701 --> 01:49:42.070
<v Speaker 6>arts fighter in the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She has Jacob.</v>

2510
01:49:42.200 --> 01:49:43.480
<v Speaker 6>Brian,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'll buy a man.</v>

2511
01:49:43.520 --> 01:49:45.120
<v Speaker 6>A boy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a boy.</v>

2512
01:49:45.121 --> 01:49:47.800
<v Speaker 6>A Matt Hughes Against Josh Koscheck.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Is it signed?</v>

2513
01:49:49.190 --> 01:49:51.030
<v Speaker 1>It's signed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's on wikipedia was.</v>

2514
01:49:51.040 --> 01:49:51.873
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that.</v>

2515
01:49:52.360 --> 01:49:55.540
<v Speaker 1>I'll find out for cute look we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>telling him,</v>

2516
01:49:55.541 --> 01:49:57.350
<v Speaker 1>but I think I saw linkedin said they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>waiting.</v>

2517
01:49:57.400 --> 01:49:59.760
<v Speaker 1>They're waiting to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just cool with everybody.</v>

2518
01:50:00.070 --> 01:50:03.070
<v Speaker 1>Fucking creepy fight for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for use because it's a totally different</v>

2519
01:50:03.071 --> 01:50:06.250
<v Speaker 1>kind of trained for Diego.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sanchez is not nearly as dangerous on</v>

2520
01:50:06.251 --> 01:50:10.180
<v Speaker 1>the feet as cost check is at least</v>
<v Speaker 1>theoretically because Diego Sanchez will</v>

2521
01:50:10.181 --> 01:50:13.120
<v Speaker 1>swore on motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He can be very dangerous on his feet,</v>

2522
01:50:13.270 --> 01:50:16.420
<v Speaker 1>but the idea was that diego would not be</v>
<v Speaker 1>able to out wrestle.</v>

2523
01:50:16.421 --> 01:50:18.130
<v Speaker 1>Matt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Matt's a big welterweight dig.</v>

2524
01:50:18.131 --> 01:50:22.060
<v Speaker 1>It was a fairly small welterweight and</v>
<v Speaker 1>also encaustic steps in who's a really</v>

2525
01:50:22.061 --> 01:50:26.080
<v Speaker 1>fucking good wrestler and is a big</v>
<v Speaker 1>welterweight and has been thinking about</v>

2526
01:50:26.081 --> 01:50:30.460
<v Speaker 1>fighting at one 85 and was actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>campaigning to try to fight in the San</v>

2527
01:50:30.460 --> 01:50:33.030
<v Speaker 1>Jose UFC in November.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here you got a guy who's a,</v>

2528
01:50:33.031 --> 01:50:34.750
<v Speaker 1>a guy who can fight it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one 85.</v>

2529
01:50:34.750 --> 01:50:36.760
<v Speaker 1>He's big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know Diego can't fight it.</v>

2530
01:50:36.761 --> 01:50:38.290
<v Speaker 1>One 85.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he did.</v>

2531
01:50:38.291 --> 01:50:41.470
<v Speaker 1>He did on the ultimate fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean competitively in the UFC he's</v>

2532
01:50:41.471 --> 01:50:43.540
<v Speaker 1>this physical frame in my opinion is too</v>
<v Speaker 1>small.</v>

2533
01:50:43.630 --> 01:50:46.590
<v Speaker 1>He could do it and you can beat a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys just by hustling them and</v>

2534
01:50:46.600 --> 01:50:49.480
<v Speaker 1>outworking him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but his best way is probably like one</v>

2535
01:50:49.490 --> 01:50:52.540
<v Speaker 1>slash 65.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Josh Koscheck and carry one 85.</v>

2536
01:50:52.570 --> 01:50:54.610
<v Speaker 1>He's a strong character.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got,</v>

2537
01:50:54.630 --> 01:50:56.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got a good frame.</v>

2538
01:50:56.051 --> 01:50:59.200
<v Speaker 1>He's a tough dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a serious fucking wrestler and you</v>

2539
01:50:59.201 --> 01:51:01.270
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's dangerous on his feet.</v>

2540
01:51:01.271 --> 01:51:03.130
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got big power in that right hand.</v>

2541
01:51:03.460 --> 01:51:07.570
<v Speaker 1>So it's a totally different fight for</v>
<v Speaker 1>Matt Hughes with three weeks notice.</v>

2542
01:51:07.660 --> 01:51:11.620
<v Speaker 1>What do you think the shelf life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a shelf life is getting smaller,</v>

2543
01:51:11.740 --> 01:51:14.470
<v Speaker 1>smaller from a fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like where you have five,</v>

2544
01:51:14.471 --> 01:51:16.750
<v Speaker 1>let's say from the time you start</v>
<v Speaker 1>sprinting,</v>

2545
01:51:16.751 --> 01:51:19.120
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get a big fight and then why you're</v>

2546
01:51:19.121 --> 01:51:19.954
<v Speaker 1>taking him a lot.</v>

2547
01:51:20.140 --> 01:51:24.190
<v Speaker 1>He's getting smaller or will eventually</v>
<v Speaker 1>be lasts longer.</v>

2548
01:51:24.220 --> 01:51:25.910
<v Speaker 1>What are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The shelf life of?</v>

2549
01:51:26.050 --> 01:51:27.430
<v Speaker 1>Do you mean how many fights you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>have?</v>

2550
01:51:27.980 --> 01:51:29.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before you start to deteriorate.</v>

2551
01:51:30.380 --> 01:51:30.771
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2552
01:51:30.771 --> 01:51:32.440
<v Speaker 1>It depends on your style.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2553
01:51:32.800 --> 01:51:35.470
<v Speaker 1>some guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other guys go with that really good.</v>

2554
01:51:35.471 --> 01:51:38.830
<v Speaker 1>Three year run and then physically</v>
<v Speaker 1>something has gotten like machita.</v>

2555
01:51:38.831 --> 01:51:41.470
<v Speaker 1>Here's a perfect example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Garlic machida takes very little damage.</v>

2556
01:51:41.471 --> 01:51:44.290
<v Speaker 1>So garlic machita,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'll run for longer than a garlic</v>

2557
01:51:44.291 --> 01:51:46.840
<v Speaker 1>vander.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And who's got this wild attacking style?</v>

2558
01:51:47.380 --> 01:51:50.650
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's maybe not vandalize a bad</v>

2559
01:51:50.651 --> 01:51:51.850
<v Speaker 1>motherfucker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

2560
01:51:51.851 --> 01:51:53.470
<v Speaker 1>Vandelay has been stopped a few times</v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

2561
01:51:53.471 --> 01:51:56.740
<v Speaker 1>but it's because of annually style</v>
<v Speaker 1>randomly played it safe.</v>

2562
01:51:56.890 --> 01:51:58.690
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you saw like in the Michael bisping</v>

2563
01:51:58.691 --> 01:51:59.950
<v Speaker 1>fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's still there.</v>

2564
01:52:00.190 --> 01:52:02.590
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe his chin isn't as good as it was</v>

2565
01:52:02.830 --> 01:52:04.990
<v Speaker 1>back in the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the truth is that back in the day he</v>

2566
01:52:04.991 --> 01:52:06.370
<v Speaker 1>got dropped a bunch of times too.</v>

2567
01:52:06.610 --> 01:52:09.280
<v Speaker 1>He would come and wild and reckless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dan Henderson dropped them.</v>

2568
01:52:09.281 --> 01:52:11.680
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people dropped him before Dan</v>
<v Speaker 1>Henderson knocked him out and their</v>

2569
01:52:11.681 --> 01:52:13.930
<v Speaker 1>second fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dan Henderson dropped him and had him</v>

2570
01:52:13.931 --> 01:52:16.670
<v Speaker 1>fucked up in their first fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He closed his eye.</v>

2571
01:52:16.671 --> 01:52:19.370
<v Speaker 1>His eye was like one big giant fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>baboons.</v>

2572
01:52:19.390 --> 01:52:20.580
<v Speaker 1>Vagina.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

2573
01:52:20.581 --> 01:52:24.100
<v Speaker 1>it was bad man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So vandelay has always been in there</v>

2574
01:52:24.101 --> 01:52:25.960
<v Speaker 1>with guys that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2575
01:52:26.080 --> 01:52:27.730
<v Speaker 1>that have put them in danger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2576
01:52:27.731 --> 01:52:30.250
<v Speaker 1>dropped him or heard him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mark Hunt dropped him.</v>

2577
01:52:30.490 --> 01:52:33.250
<v Speaker 1>But when he got in there against real</v>
<v Speaker 1>good strikers,</v>

2578
01:52:33.251 --> 01:52:36.610
<v Speaker 1>that's when he had real problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why cro cop fucked him up.</v>

2579
01:52:36.880 --> 01:52:38.740
<v Speaker 1>If you go back to watch that fight in</v>
<v Speaker 1>pride,</v>

2580
01:52:38.741 --> 01:52:39.300
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

2581
01:52:39.300 --> 01:52:42.610
<v Speaker 1>he beat cro cop in their first fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or maybe it was a draw I think because</v>

2582
01:52:42.611 --> 01:52:45.100
<v Speaker 1>they had weird rules like if you only go</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the ground for like 30,</v>

2583
01:52:45.920 --> 01:52:46.220
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

2584
01:52:46.220 --> 01:52:49.430
<v Speaker 6>vandelay took a lot of hard fucking</v>
<v Speaker 6>kicks to the body.</v>

2585
01:52:49.550 --> 01:52:51.680
<v Speaker 6>That was when cro cop was in his prime</v>
<v Speaker 6>cro.</v>

2586
01:52:51.681 --> 01:52:54.530
<v Speaker 6>Cop didn't have a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a sprawl yet though he wasn't confident</v>

2587
01:52:54.531 --> 01:52:57.560
<v Speaker 6>enough with his take down defense to</v>
<v Speaker 6>have a full mma fight,</v>

2588
01:52:57.810 --> 01:53:00.380
<v Speaker 6>but by the time they fought,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the second time man that was cro cop in</v>

2589
01:53:00.381 --> 01:53:03.620
<v Speaker 6>his prime,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that was the heavyweight Grand Prix and</v>

2590
01:53:03.621 --> 01:53:06.530
<v Speaker 6>he fucking head kicked vandelay into</v>
<v Speaker 6>another universe.</v>

2591
01:53:06.531 --> 01:53:08.600
<v Speaker 6>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That was when cro cop was the best.</v>

2592
01:53:08.750 --> 01:53:12.440
<v Speaker 6>So vandelay without wild styles always</v>
<v Speaker 6>had a problem with guys like that.</v>

2593
01:53:12.590 --> 01:53:13.260
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>bro,</v>

2594
01:53:13.260 --> 01:53:14.960
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but he's awesome though.</v>

2595
01:53:14.990 --> 01:53:18.680
<v Speaker 6>Talking about fighters here,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're as much of a fan of his.</v>

2596
01:53:18.681 --> 01:53:22.760
<v Speaker 6>Even more than I am.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Vandelay fighting carried.</v>

2597
01:53:22.761 --> 01:53:24.360
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Find my huge vandelay fan.</v>

2598
01:53:25.320 --> 01:53:28.850
<v Speaker 6>Longevity now is what you make.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Look at the guidance.</v>

2599
01:53:28.880 --> 01:53:30.830
<v Speaker 6>Joe Rogan turned me onto that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I met,</v>

2600
01:53:30.831 --> 01:53:34.280
<v Speaker 6>I had the honor of meeting and talking</v>
<v Speaker 6>to him and he just fought a fight.</v>

2601
01:53:34.310 --> 01:53:39.310
<v Speaker 6>Bernard Hopkins fought the fight of his</v>
<v Speaker 6>fucking life and he fought it and it was</v>

2602
01:53:39.711 --> 01:53:41.450
<v Speaker 6>customed to him.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm 46,</v>

2603
01:53:41.451 --> 01:53:42.240
<v Speaker 6>Bro.</v>

2604
01:53:42.240 --> 01:53:44.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to get into a band with no</v>
<v Speaker 1>body,</v>

2605
01:53:44.150 --> 01:53:46.650
<v Speaker 1>but I'm going to throw punches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get the fuck out of there.</v>

2606
01:53:46.860 --> 01:53:47.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2607
01:53:47.670 --> 01:53:48.503
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

2608
01:53:48.510 --> 01:53:50.340
<v Speaker 1>this fight was very different than the</v>
<v Speaker 1>first fight.</v>

2609
01:53:50.570 --> 01:53:52.380
<v Speaker 1>This fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He actually got in and mixed it up with</v>

2610
01:53:52.381 --> 01:53:54.750
<v Speaker 1>this guy and he took it out of his game.</v>

2611
01:53:55.220 --> 01:53:56.360
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whatever they do,</v>

2612
01:53:56.390 --> 01:53:58.700
<v Speaker 6>it's what they take care of,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how smart they are.</v>

2613
01:53:58.701 --> 01:54:01.600
<v Speaker 6>GSP is fucking genius.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He takes care of himself at all.</v>

2614
01:54:02.160 --> 01:54:02.791
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what he is,</v>

2615
01:54:02.791 --> 01:54:04.020
<v Speaker 1>he's honest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's honest,</v>

2616
01:54:04.050 --> 01:54:07.020
<v Speaker 1>he's honest about what's at risk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of guys who aren't honest</v>

2617
01:54:07.021 --> 01:54:08.070
<v Speaker 1>about what's at risk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2618
01:54:08.071 --> 01:54:10.140
<v Speaker 1>and that's one of the things why he says</v>
<v Speaker 1>he won't fight a friend.</v>

2619
01:54:10.410 --> 01:54:11.730
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he talked about it,</v>

2620
01:54:11.731 --> 01:54:14.910
<v Speaker 1>that I could do this if on top of them</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I see an elbow again,</v>

2621
01:54:14.940 --> 01:54:18.840
<v Speaker 1>I deliver it and give cerebral damage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know he's,</v>

2622
01:54:19.080 --> 01:54:21.780
<v Speaker 1>but he's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He feels he knows what the fuck he's</v>

2623
01:54:21.781 --> 01:54:23.550
<v Speaker 1>doing because he's had it done to him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

2624
01:54:23.700 --> 01:54:27.360
<v Speaker 1>When Matt Serra mounted him and was</v>
<v Speaker 1>dropping bombs on them and Matt,</v>

2625
01:54:27.361 --> 01:54:29.610
<v Speaker 1>Sarah can fucking punch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me tell you something.</v>

2626
01:54:29.611 --> 01:54:33.300
<v Speaker 1>That little guineas got bricks in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got bricks in his gloves.</v>

2627
01:54:33.390 --> 01:54:35.000
<v Speaker 1>I never seen anybody that Matt Serra</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't.</v>

2628
01:54:35.010 --> 01:54:37.020
<v Speaker 1>He punched clean that didn't get put on</v>
<v Speaker 1>Queer Street.</v>

2629
01:54:37.021 --> 01:54:39.270
<v Speaker 1>He hit fucking hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

2630
01:54:39.270 --> 01:54:42.240
<v Speaker 1>So when he clipped George in that fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could tell George was like,</v>

2631
01:54:42.330 --> 01:54:44.320
<v Speaker 1>oh shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he,</v>

2632
01:54:44.321 --> 01:54:46.620
<v Speaker 1>he can tell his functioning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drop,</v>

2633
01:54:46.621 --> 01:54:50.670
<v Speaker 1>like he knows what it's like to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>really clipped and you know,</v>

2634
01:54:50.730 --> 01:54:54.060
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't want that to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's a very fucking smart dude.</v>

2635
01:54:54.061 --> 01:54:57.570
<v Speaker 1>He's completely honest and aware about</v>
<v Speaker 1>the entire game.</v>

2636
01:54:57.690 --> 01:54:59.190
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the reasons why he's so</v>
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

2637
01:54:59.280 --> 01:55:01.680
<v Speaker 1>He'll tell you exactly how he feels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am nervous.</v>

2638
01:55:01.770 --> 01:55:04.620
<v Speaker 1>This is a very important fight for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This a fucking champ,</v>

2639
01:55:04.740 --> 01:55:07.920
<v Speaker 1>one of the best pound for pound fighters</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the world and he's nervous and he's</v>

2640
01:55:07.921 --> 01:55:11.190
<v Speaker 1>talking about being nervous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then he gets in there and just fucking</v>

2641
01:55:11.191 --> 01:55:13.310
<v Speaker 1>shines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gets in there and just</v>

2642
01:55:13.640 --> 01:55:16.250
<v Speaker 6>lights.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You both know and you and you.</v>

2643
01:55:16.490 --> 01:55:21.370
<v Speaker 6>The day you stop getting nervous before</v>
<v Speaker 6>you go on stage is the day you just go</v>

2644
01:55:21.371 --> 01:55:22.204
<v Speaker 6>home.</v>

2645
01:55:22.700 --> 01:55:25.600
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The worst thing you do with George St</v>

2646
01:55:25.600 --> 01:55:30.490
<v Speaker 1>Pierre Man is talk some shit to Bj Penn</v>
<v Speaker 1>when Bj was talking about that shit man.</v>

2647
01:55:30.491 --> 01:55:34.600
<v Speaker 1>You could see the determination grow and</v>
<v Speaker 1>George's eyes and George is a</v>

2648
01:55:34.660 --> 01:55:38.650
<v Speaker 1>disciplined motherfucker and one of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>things about guys that are truly,</v>

2649
01:55:38.651 --> 01:55:41.720
<v Speaker 1>truly disciplined and really in amazing</v>
<v Speaker 1>condition like,</v>

2650
01:55:41.800 --> 01:55:45.540
<v Speaker 1>like Nick Diaz as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that these guys know that they can</v>

2651
01:55:45.541 --> 01:55:49.800
<v Speaker 1>push a pace that most people will drown</v>
<v Speaker 1>under so they'll fucking force it</v>

2652
01:55:49.801 --> 01:55:52.500
<v Speaker 1>because they know you might be talented,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might be talented,</v>

2653
01:55:52.501 --> 01:55:54.180
<v Speaker 1>but maybe you didn't get up early</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough.</v>

2654
01:55:54.181 --> 01:55:57.330
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you didn't sleep enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you didn't eat the right foods.</v>

2655
01:55:57.390 --> 01:55:59.070
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you didn't take the right</v>
<v Speaker 1>vitamins.</v>

2656
01:55:59.160 --> 01:56:01.920
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you didn't fucking put in 100</v>
<v Speaker 1>percent and stack your training</v>

2657
01:56:01.921 --> 01:56:05.700
<v Speaker 1>correctly and have a professional,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a physical trainer working with you,</v>

2658
01:56:05.701 --> 01:56:09.300
<v Speaker 1>monitoring your heartbeat will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>George does or he knows he can run you</v>

2659
01:56:09.301 --> 01:56:10.950
<v Speaker 1>out into the middle of the fucking ocean</v>
<v Speaker 1>bitch,</v>

2660
01:56:11.100 --> 01:56:12.390
<v Speaker 1>and that's what he did with Bj man.</v>

2661
01:56:12.390 --> 01:56:15.280
<v Speaker 1>He just put him in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put him in a position where he forced</v>

2662
01:56:15.281 --> 01:56:16.860
<v Speaker 1>them to work real hard from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning,</v>

2663
01:56:17.010 --> 01:56:20.550
<v Speaker 1>tired his muscles out and started taking</v>
<v Speaker 1>him down and beating the fuck out of</v>

2664
01:56:20.551 --> 01:56:22.620
<v Speaker 1>them and the way he did it was genius</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2665
01:56:22.680 --> 01:56:25.920
<v Speaker 1>and the way he did it was fueled by that</v>
<v Speaker 1>determination that was brought on by</v>

2666
01:56:25.921 --> 01:56:27.660
<v Speaker 1>that shit talking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought he'd did it.</v>

2667
01:56:27.661 --> 01:56:30.930
<v Speaker 1>The fucking Katya.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Katya kind of wore a monocle for a</v>

2668
01:56:30.930 --> 01:56:34.030
<v Speaker 1>fucking year and he might don't walk in</v>
<v Speaker 1>that room with a fucking Monaco.</v>

2669
01:56:34.080 --> 01:56:37.580
<v Speaker 1>He check out of that with the Jack the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck.</v>

2670
01:56:38.490 --> 01:56:41.640
<v Speaker 1>Not Ten Times 30 times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I fucked it up,</v>

2671
01:56:41.910 --> 01:56:44.040
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to keep punching because I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to fuck it up again.</v>

2672
01:56:44.190 --> 01:56:47.220
<v Speaker 1>Every time you look in the mirror and</v>
<v Speaker 1>blink motherfucking comes under GSP,</v>

2673
01:56:47.700 --> 01:56:49.920

<v Speaker 1>I went to this thing the more to</v>

2674

<v Speaker 1>teenagers.</v>

<v Speaker 1>13 and 14,</v>
<v Speaker 1>15 sec documents.</v>

2684
01:57:22.470 --> 01:57:24.750
<v Speaker 1>The only guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's a less than 20 losses and</v>

2685
01:57:24.751 --> 01:57:28.220
<v Speaker 1>198 fucking victories and he let this</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude up.</v>

2686

<v Speaker 1>believe,</v>

2687
01:57:30.540 --> 01:57:33.420
<v Speaker 1>and he was talking all kinds of shit and</v>
<v Speaker 1>pushed them at the weigh ins and the</v>

2688
01:57:33.421 --> 01:57:36.300
<v Speaker 1>ties are very respectful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they don't do that kind of shit.</v>

2689
01:57:36.301 --> 01:57:37.830
<v Speaker 1>They they like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have this dance.</v>

2690
01:57:37.831 --> 01:57:41.100
<v Speaker 1>They do rather why crew in the middle of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ring before and they did all this</v>

2691
01:57:41.101 --> 01:57:42.990
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They played the music and these guys did</v>

01:57:42.991 --> 01:57:44.460
<v Speaker 1>their dance and they went through their</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

2693
01:57:44.700 --> 01:57:46.140
<v Speaker 1>but when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when fucking,</v>

2694
01:57:46.141 --> 01:57:49.590
<v Speaker 1>when Booyah cow did it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was doing his dance to the guy like</v>

2695
01:57:49.591 --> 01:57:51.240
<v Speaker 1>got like right in the guy's face.</v>

01:57:51.240 --> 01:57:54.240
<v Speaker 1>Does that pushed him at the weigh ins?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was bad ass man.</v>

2697
01:57:54.241 --> 01:57:56.070
<v Speaker 1>He was like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like a movie fight.</v>

2698
01:57:56.190 --> 01:58:00.360
<v Speaker 1>Like he got in the guy's face and was</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing like pooling arrows and stomping</v>

2699
01:58:00.361 --> 01:58:03.150
<v Speaker 1>on the ground and doing his little dance</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the dude didn't know whether he</v>

2700
01:58:03.151 --> 01:58:05.100
<v Speaker 1>should give grounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the dude was like backed up in the</v>

2701
01:58:05.101 --> 01:58:08.310
<v Speaker 1>corner while blue car was standing in</v>
<v Speaker 1>front of him doing this little dance and</v>

2702
01:58:08.311 --> 01:58:10.380
<v Speaker 1>then the fight started and dude came out</v>
<v Speaker 1>strong.</v>

2703
01:58:10.410 --> 01:58:13.590
<v Speaker 1>He came out trying to blast but bookout</v>
<v Speaker 1>198 fights.</v>

2704
01:58:13.591 --> 01:58:18.591
<v Speaker 1>He's so calm and I need you start</v>
<v Speaker 1>chopping with those kicks and you feel</v>

2705
01:58:18.901 --> 01:58:22.560
<v Speaker 1>the fucking leg kick over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we were in the front row and you</v>

2706
01:58:22.561 --> 01:58:27.000
<v Speaker 1>could just feel that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think of that fucking shit.</v>

2707
01:58:27.520 --> 01:58:29.970
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you could slowly see his legs</v>

2708
01:58:29.971 --> 01:58:32.140
<v Speaker 1>starting to give out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he was going high with them and</v>

2709
01:58:32.141 --> 01:58:35.320
<v Speaker 1>just beating his ass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>flying Needham Front kicked him,</v>

2710
01:58:35.380 --> 01:58:37.590
<v Speaker 1>finally front kicked him and knocked him</v>
<v Speaker 1>down and the referee said,</v>

2711
01:58:37.591 --> 01:58:38.760
<v Speaker 1>that's enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's enough.</v>

2712
01:58:38.850 --> 01:58:41.200
<v Speaker 1>The referees saved them because let me</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell you something,</v>

2713
01:58:41.320 --> 01:58:42.390
<v Speaker 1>they hit boycott</v>

2714
01:58:42.400 --> 01:58:45.640
<v Speaker 6>was just starting to break the guy down.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They were in the fourth round and the</v>

2715
01:58:45.641 --> 01:58:48.130
<v Speaker 6>guy was just starting to stumble and</v>
<v Speaker 6>fall apart.</v>

2716
01:58:48.280 --> 01:58:50.530
<v Speaker 6>And he kept hitting those fucking lazy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whack,</v>

2717
01:58:50.531 --> 01:58:52.080
<v Speaker 6>whack,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whack,</v>

2718
01:58:52.090 --> 01:58:54.640
<v Speaker 6>whack.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was crazy to watch live,</v>

<v Speaker 6>It's awesome.</v>

2720
01:58:55.481 --> 01:58:58.710
<v Speaker 6>And you see that level of stand up and</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's like the difference between cost</v>

2721
01:58:58.711 --> 01:59:00.210
<v Speaker 6>check and George St Pierre in that</v>
<v Speaker 6>fight.</v>

2722
01:59:00.500 --> 01:59:03.340
<v Speaker 6>Cash check is a very.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's a very good athlete.</v>

2723
01:59:03.520 --> 01:59:05.920
<v Speaker 6>He's got power and his punches,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if he hits you,</v>

2724
01:59:05.921 --> 01:59:08.050
<v Speaker 6>you're really fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But in,</v>

2725
01:59:08.140 --> 01:59:11.920
<v Speaker 6>at least in competition,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he has never shown to be a really</v>

2726
01:59:11.921 --> 01:59:13.840
<v Speaker 6>technical striker.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2727
01:59:13.841 --> 01:59:15.820
<v Speaker 6>he's been caught by Paulo,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Tiago.</v>

2728
01:59:15.970 --> 01:59:17.830
<v Speaker 6>He's a very tough guy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but you know,</v>

2729
01:59:17.831 --> 01:59:21.010
<v Speaker 6>don't get me wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but he's not like a guy like blue cow.</v>

2730
01:59:21.070 --> 01:59:23.050
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's a certain level of striking</v>

2731
01:59:23.200 --> 01:59:27.250
<v Speaker 6>where a guy gets to where they're like</v>
<v Speaker 6>always safe and they're just lighten you</v>

2732
01:59:27.251 --> 01:59:27.460
<v Speaker 6>up.</v>

2733
01:59:27.460 --> 01:59:30.010
<v Speaker 6>They find your timing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like when Anderson did the Chanel</v>

2734
01:59:30.010 --> 01:59:32.370
<v Speaker 6>Okami,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he finds your timing and then he safe</v>

2735
01:59:32.380 --> 01:59:34.270
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're in a fistfight and he's not.</v>

2736
01:59:34.271 --> 01:59:36.400
<v Speaker 6>How about that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>How about you're just a fucking target</v>

2737
01:59:36.640 --> 01:59:38.480
<v Speaker 6>and he's standing right in front of you</v>
<v Speaker 6>and bang,</v>

2738
01:59:38.530 --> 01:59:39.970
<v Speaker 6>Bang,</v>
<v Speaker 6>just firing off on,</v>

2739
01:59:39.971 --> 01:59:42.100
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and when you see that happen man,</v>

2740
01:59:42.101 --> 01:59:44.860
<v Speaker 6>and you see a guy figured out another</v>
<v Speaker 6>guy's timing like that,</v>

2741
01:59:44.861 --> 01:59:45.694
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's,</v>

2742
01:59:45.700 --> 01:59:47.410
<v Speaker 6>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's a wild shit to see.</v>

2743
01:59:47.650 --> 01:59:49.450
<v Speaker 6>And there's guys that can do that to</v>
<v Speaker 6>George.</v>

2744
01:59:49.480 --> 01:59:54.020
<v Speaker 6>There's guys the strikers that could do</v>
<v Speaker 6>that to George and a straight kickboxing</v>

2745
01:59:54.040 --> 01:59:56.070
<v Speaker 6>match,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but just can only do it when they find</v>

2746
01:59:56.071 --> 01:59:57.370
<v Speaker 6>out that takedown.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

2747
01:59:57.430 --> 01:59:59.740
<v Speaker 6>they can't.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They get scared of that takedown and</v>

2748
01:59:59.741 --> 02:00:03.340
<v Speaker 6>then they can't pull the trigger.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that's what happens because George</v>

2749
02:00:03.341 --> 02:00:07.090
<v Speaker 6>hits you with that power double that</v>
<v Speaker 6>comes straight from fucking Mars.</v>

2750
02:00:07.300 --> 02:00:10.240
<v Speaker 6>He pushes off that ground and covers</v>
<v Speaker 6>distance in a way.</v>

2751
02:00:10.241 --> 02:00:12.430
<v Speaker 6>You can't believe this guy can move that</v>
<v Speaker 6>fast.</v>

2752
02:00:12.550 --> 02:00:14.950
<v Speaker 6>For a white dude.</v>
<v Speaker 6>How is this dude moving?</v>

2753
02:00:14.951 --> 02:00:18.520
<v Speaker 6>So fucking fast.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know why I was doing that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anna Nicole Smith bit where like,</v>

2822
02:02:34.760 --> 02:02:39.760
<v Speaker 1>it's time Kevin James wrote for Rim job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kevin James wrote that because I was</v>

2823
02:02:40.761 --> 02:02:41.780
<v Speaker 1>already like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looked at ask.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You don't get that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2826
02:02:45.231 --> 02:02:49.130
<v Speaker 1>about Anna Nicole Smith's husband forced</v>
<v Speaker 1>her and Kevin and I were just riffing on</v>

2827
02:02:49.131 --> 02:02:52.670
<v Speaker 1>it and Kevin came up with it's time for</v>
<v Speaker 1>a real job and I became like one of the</v>

2828
02:02:52.671 --> 02:02:56.000
<v Speaker 1>big punchlines in there and I would say</v>
<v Speaker 1>it and it was cool because I would say</v>

2829
02:02:56.001 --> 02:02:56.570
<v Speaker 1>it on stage.</v>

2830
02:02:56.570 --> 02:02:58.940
<v Speaker 1>I would think of him like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my friend hooked me up with a good</v>

2831
02:02:58.941 --> 02:03:03.350
<v Speaker 1>solid laughing here because a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>times you do this not to the same bit,</v>

2832
02:03:03.351 --> 02:03:06.620
<v Speaker 1>but you're just so close to it that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't see it from that little bit of an</v>

2833
02:03:06.621 --> 02:03:07.920
<v Speaker 1>angular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're,</v>

2834
02:03:08.110 --> 02:03:09.760
<v Speaker 1>you're taking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's right there.</v>

2835
02:03:09.770 --> 02:03:11.840
<v Speaker 1>If we're both going to write a joke</v>
<v Speaker 1>about anything,</v>

2836
02:03:11.841 --> 02:03:13.520
<v Speaker 1>whether we were both going to write a</v>
<v Speaker 1>joke about coffee,</v>

2837
02:03:13.521 --> 02:03:15.620
<v Speaker 1>you would come from one place and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>would come from another.</v>

2838
02:03:15.621 --> 02:03:19.880
<v Speaker 1>Even though we're both comics and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>both would see like some obvious points,</v>

2839
02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:21.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2840
02:03:21.110 --> 02:03:25.010
<v Speaker 1>like there was a joke that I did that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>found out that Ellen Degeneres had done</v>

2841
02:03:25.011 --> 02:03:28.220
<v Speaker 1>a joke just like it years before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I had never seen Elon do it,</v>

2842
02:03:28.221 --> 02:03:31.820
<v Speaker 1>but the premise is really obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the premise was about penguins being</v>

2843
02:03:31.821 --> 02:03:34.760
<v Speaker 1>monogamous and the premises,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while they both look the same,</v>

2844
02:03:35.210 --> 02:03:35.930
<v Speaker 1>they all look the same.</v>

2845
02:03:35.930 --> 02:03:37.670
<v Speaker 1>Like what's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the big deal about them being</v>

2846
02:03:37.671 --> 02:03:40.040
<v Speaker 1>monogamous?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's something that anybody would</v>

2847
02:03:40.041 --> 02:03:42.170
<v Speaker 1>see if you're looking for the point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2848
02:03:42.171 --> 02:03:44.090
<v Speaker 1>you're looking for like comedy in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

2849
02:03:44.091 --> 02:03:46.670
<v Speaker 1>in like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an obvious sort of a situation like</v>

2850
02:03:46.671 --> 02:03:48.100
<v Speaker 1>penguins been monogamous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2851
02:03:48.260 --> 02:03:50.060
<v Speaker 1>you were probably come up with the exact</v>
<v Speaker 1>same thing.</v>

2852
02:03:50.061 --> 02:03:52.580
<v Speaker 1>If I said write a bit about penguins</v>
<v Speaker 1>being monogamous,</v>

2853
02:03:52.750 --> 02:03:54.230
<v Speaker 1>you would probably be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what's the big deal?</v>

2854
02:03:54.231 --> 02:03:57.000
<v Speaker 1>They look exactly the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You instantly go to it.</v>

2855
02:03:57.050 --> 02:03:59.510
<v Speaker 1>Ninety percent of comedians would</v>
<v Speaker 1>instantly go to that,</v>

2856
02:04:00.020 --> 02:04:03.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's like your take from there on,</v>

2857
02:04:03.051 --> 02:04:04.940
<v Speaker 1>once you get that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it's going to be like,</v>

2858
02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:07.180
<v Speaker 1>some people go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Duncan would get real weird with</v>

2859
02:04:07.181 --> 02:04:09.500
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would find some fucking weird</v>

2860
02:04:09.501 --> 02:04:12.740
<v Speaker 1>spiritual angle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And will they say in the Bhagavad Gita?</v>

2861
02:04:12.830 --> 02:04:15.760
<v Speaker 1>And he would be like coming out and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>would have a different.</v>

2862
02:04:15.810 --> 02:04:17.090
<v Speaker 1>And it's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a different angle.</v>

2863
02:04:17.100 --> 02:04:20.500
<v Speaker 1>When somebody gives you a tag it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it feels like somebody sometimes just</v>

2864
02:04:20.510 --> 02:04:23.570
<v Speaker 1>give you a $500 bill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like sometimes you have the same,</v>

2865
02:04:23.571 --> 02:04:27.320
<v Speaker 1>like that's the date you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you couldn't have wrapped gift or</v>

2866
02:04:27.321 --> 02:04:30.500
<v Speaker 1>bought something on Amazon that would do</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same feeling.</v>

2867
02:04:30.560 --> 02:04:32.540
<v Speaker 1>I had a friend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brian Frazier,</v>

2868
02:04:32.570 --> 02:04:33.140
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2869
02:04:33.140 --> 02:04:37.050
<v Speaker 1>at the time was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he needed some money and I was making a</v>

2870
02:04:37.051 --> 02:04:38.040
<v Speaker 1>lot of money and he had</v>

2871
02:04:38.040 --> 02:04:40.020
<v Speaker 6>a heckler line and I like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>dude,</v>

2872
02:04:40.021 --> 02:04:41.520
<v Speaker 6>this is the greatest fucking Heco line.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Every goes,</v>

2873
02:04:41.530 --> 02:04:42.290
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Salazia.</v>

2874
02:04:42.290 --> 02:04:45.150
<v Speaker 6>So he sold it to me for 500 bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is the,</v>

2875
02:04:45.151 --> 02:04:46.800
<v Speaker 6>this is the heckler line,</v>
<v Speaker 6>because I never used it.</v>

2876
02:04:47.010 --> 02:04:49.680
<v Speaker 6>But because it felt weird,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but this is that he said,</v>

2877
02:04:49.770 --> 02:04:52.020
<v Speaker 6>because this is what happened when God</v>
<v Speaker 6>made you.</v>

2878
02:04:52.170 --> 02:04:53.900
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and just a dash of content.</v>

2879
02:04:53.990 --> 02:04:56.690
<v Speaker 8>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 8>The cop pull off the top,</v>

2880
02:04:56.691 --> 02:05:01.640
<v Speaker 8>fell off too much,</v>
<v Speaker 8>gets great line.</v>

2881
02:05:01.820 --> 02:05:03.820
<v Speaker 8>I just had this past week,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it was just,</v>

2882
02:05:03.830 --> 02:05:07.790
<v Speaker 8>I was trying to think of situations back</v>
<v Speaker 8>in the day when guys were preparing for</v>

2883
02:05:07.791 --> 02:05:10.100
<v Speaker 8>battle,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but their wives were still in their</v>

2884
02:05:10.101 --> 02:05:12.920
<v Speaker 8>brain because I was trying to go ladies,</v>
<v Speaker 8>every once a while your guy gets a look</v>

2885
02:05:12.921 --> 02:05:14.240
<v Speaker 8>on his face,</v>
<v Speaker 8>just leave him alone.</v>

2886
02:05:14.300 --> 02:05:18.230
<v Speaker 8>He's trying to and I act like I was a</v>
<v Speaker 8>guy sharpening my sword and did the hand</v>

2887
02:05:18.231 --> 02:05:20.470
<v Speaker 8>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like the wife was right in there.</v>

2888
02:05:20.790 --> 02:05:22.520
<v Speaker 8>A kamiko you should have her bitch</v>
<v Speaker 8>about.</v>

2889
02:05:22.521 --> 02:05:26.010
<v Speaker 8>Really you can leave a shield right on</v>
<v Speaker 8>the table like Paul.</v>

2890
02:05:26.060 --> 02:05:28.250
<v Speaker 8>That's all for today and then the very</v>
<v Speaker 8>next show did it,</v>

2891
02:05:28.370 --> 02:05:31.970
<v Speaker 8>but it adds a whole different spin to</v>
<v Speaker 8>your act when you get that little fun.</v>

2892
02:05:32.810 --> 02:05:34.150
<v Speaker 8>Thanks for the layup though.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yes.</v>

2893
02:05:34.170 --> 02:05:34.761
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 8>yeah.</v>

2894
02:05:34.761 --> 02:05:37.040
<v Speaker 8>Thanks for the insight.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Sometimes that turns it into a bigger</v>

2895
02:05:37.041 --> 02:05:39.470
<v Speaker 8>bit that turns it into something you</v>
<v Speaker 8>weren't even thinking.</v>

2896
02:05:39.710 --> 02:05:42.900
<v Speaker 6>What's really funny how some comics will</v>
<v Speaker 6>take attack,</v>

2897
02:05:43.110 --> 02:05:45.790
<v Speaker 6>like I'll take the tag from somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I definitely trust it.</v>

2898
02:05:45.830 --> 02:05:47.970
<v Speaker 6>Somebody gave me a tag once and it was</v>
<v Speaker 6>fucking stolen.</v>

2899
02:05:47.980 --> 02:05:52.440
<v Speaker 6>Adab spinning the guy's fucking face.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Fucking careful.</v>

2900
02:05:52.530 --> 02:05:55.990
<v Speaker 6>What time I like when a comic comes up</v>
<v Speaker 6>and sees me,</v>

2901
02:05:56.020 --> 02:06:00.720
<v Speaker 6>it gives me a different angle and and</v>
<v Speaker 6>years ago I remember watching Chris rock</v>

2902
02:06:00.721 --> 02:06:04.200
<v Speaker 6>the one special and it was pretty funny</v>
<v Speaker 6>and then he had the second one that I</v>

2903
02:06:04.201 --> 02:06:07.740
<v Speaker 6>remember seeing him at the store on a</v>
<v Speaker 6>Monday and he had jenny and the Apollo</v>

2904
02:06:07.741 --> 02:06:09.930
<v Speaker 6>with them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I didn't know what the fuck they were</v>

2905
02:06:09.931 --> 02:06:11.490
<v Speaker 6>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They were just talking and then the next</v>

2906
02:06:11.491 --> 02:06:13.920
<v Speaker 6>night it was at the Improv and then he</v>
<v Speaker 6>is Louis,</v>

2907
02:06:13.921 --> 02:06:15.630
<v Speaker 6>cK,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and Apollo.</v>

2908
02:06:16.200 --> 02:06:19.470
<v Speaker 6>And what he was doing was he would get</v>
<v Speaker 6>this advanced or major beyond.</v>

2909
02:06:19.471 --> 02:06:22.140
<v Speaker 6>Give everybody a taste and go during the</v>
<v Speaker 6>week.</v>

2910
02:06:22.470 --> 02:06:25.650
<v Speaker 6>I Want Jenny to Paolo and you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you guys each come up with 15.</v>

2911
02:06:25.651 --> 02:06:27.780
<v Speaker 6>I'll do 15.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We got a party.</v>

2912
02:06:28.540 --> 02:06:29.760
<v Speaker 6>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm getting 200 grand.</v>

2913
02:06:29.761 --> 02:06:32.100
<v Speaker 6>I give everybody 50.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I keep 50 for an events.</v>

2914
02:06:32.370 --> 02:06:34.950
<v Speaker 6>I got to fucking pilot.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I get the best of what they had and</v>

2915
02:06:34.951 --> 02:06:38.940
<v Speaker 6>gather perspectives on styles of doing</v>
<v Speaker 6>the punch and you could see the</v>

2916
02:06:38.941 --> 02:06:42.240
<v Speaker 6>difference in the specials.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You could see the difference in the</v>

2917
02:06:42.241 --> 02:06:44.760
<v Speaker 6>specials as early specials in the ones.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Later on,</v>

2918
02:06:45.060 --> 02:06:47.970
<v Speaker 6>you could see the Paolo,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you could see the precision of Richard.</v>

2919
02:06:47.971 --> 02:06:50.510
<v Speaker 6>Jenny.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You could see the wackiness of Louis C,</v>

2920
02:06:50.630 --> 02:06:51.750
<v Speaker 6>k.</v>
<v Speaker 6>let me tell you something.</v>

2921
02:06:51.990 --> 02:06:55.230
<v Speaker 6>Not a lot of fucking comics could do</v>
<v Speaker 6>that because of their ego.</v>

2922
02:06:56.460 --> 02:06:57.750
<v Speaker 6>Couldn't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>A lot of comments.</v>

2923
02:06:57.840 --> 02:06:59.400
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's also comics that want their</v>

2924
02:06:59.420 --> 02:07:02.770
<v Speaker 6>standup though to be from their own.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like Louis,</v>

2925
02:07:02.790 --> 02:07:03.510
<v Speaker 6>c,</v>
<v Speaker 6>k.</v>

2926
02:07:03.510 --> 02:07:04.290
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

2927
02:07:04.290 --> 02:07:05.070
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2928
02:07:05.070 --> 02:07:06.510
<v Speaker 6>I could see doing that way,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

2929
02:07:06.511 --> 02:07:07.740
<v Speaker 6>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you have to do an hour,</v>

2930
02:07:07.750 --> 02:07:10.320
<v Speaker 6>there's nothing wrong with hiring a</v>
<v Speaker 6>bunch of people for writers and coming</v>

2931
02:07:10.321 --> 02:07:12.450
<v Speaker 6>up with some good material and there's</v>
<v Speaker 6>nothing wrong with that.</v>

2932
02:07:12.480 --> 02:07:14.520
<v Speaker 6>As long as it fits your sense of like</v>
<v Speaker 6>minded.</v>

2933
02:07:14.540 --> 02:07:15.400
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it doesn't.</v>

2934
02:07:15.570 --> 02:07:17.910
<v Speaker 6>I never like.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Let's think about like Chris Rock,</v>

2935
02:07:18.270 --> 02:07:20.790
<v Speaker 6>Chris Rock's not really that good</v>
<v Speaker 6>because he had guys writing for him,</v>

2936
02:07:20.791 --> 02:07:22.770
<v Speaker 6>which is ridiculous because he's one of</v>
<v Speaker 6>the greatest of all time.</v>

2937
02:07:22.860 --> 02:07:25.080
<v Speaker 6>Unquestionably.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Unquestionably one of the greatest of</v>

2938
02:07:25.081 --> 02:07:25.590
<v Speaker 6>all time.</v>

2939
02:07:25.590 --> 02:07:28.460
<v Speaker 8>And the stronger voice you have,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the more you can have other people are.</v>

2940
02:07:28.461 --> 02:07:29.550
<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 8>looking at any of the,</v>

2941
02:07:29.560 --> 02:07:31.350
<v Speaker 8>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>blue collar guys,</v>

2942
02:07:31.380 --> 02:07:34.860
<v Speaker 8>but it's funny how teams of guys that</v>
<v Speaker 8>kind of fill those,</v>

2943
02:07:35.140 --> 02:07:36.100
<v Speaker 8>those models,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you can</v>

2944
02:07:36.100 --> 02:07:38.110
<v Speaker 6>take credit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>My point is you can take credit for your</v>

2945
02:07:38.111 --> 02:07:40.360
<v Speaker 6>own work,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but to think that somehow or another</v>

2946
02:07:40.361 --> 02:07:44.110
<v Speaker 6>your work is better because you come up</v>
<v Speaker 6>with a completely on your own as opposed</v>

2947
02:07:44.111 --> 02:07:46.540
<v Speaker 6>to someone who hired a bunch of writers</v>
<v Speaker 6>is kind of silly,</v>

2948
02:07:46.660 --> 02:07:48.190
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean he's just trying to get a</v>

2949
02:07:48.191 --> 02:07:51.220
<v Speaker 6>different point of view and perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but ultimately it's coming out of his</v>

2950
02:07:51.221 --> 02:07:52.870
<v Speaker 6>mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's going to be his voice and he,</v>

2951
02:07:53.140 --> 02:07:55.540
<v Speaker 6>he assigned those writers to help him</v>
<v Speaker 6>with this.</v>

2952
02:07:56.140 --> 02:07:56.980
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's just different.</v>

2953
02:07:57.010 --> 02:07:59.320
<v Speaker 6>Especially if you have,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you're the type of actor who's gotTa</v>

2954
02:07:59.350 --> 02:08:02.890
<v Speaker 6>create a crank out a just a.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You don't have to,</v>

2955
02:08:03.250 --> 02:08:07.120
<v Speaker 6>you can't do an 80 percent fun job.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It has to be out of the park every time.</v>

2956
02:08:07.270 --> 02:08:09.910
<v Speaker 6>And if you do that once a year,</v>
<v Speaker 6>here's where it would suck though.</v>

2957
02:08:09.940 --> 02:08:13.330
<v Speaker 6>Where it would suck is if everybody got</v>
<v Speaker 6>an equal say in what you said on stage.</v>

2958
02:08:13.600 --> 02:08:16.480
<v Speaker 6>See if you were a team,</v>
<v Speaker 6>say if you were a band and it was the</v>

2959
02:08:16.481 --> 02:08:19.960
<v Speaker 6>three of us and we had to construct a</v>
<v Speaker 6>set and then maybe Joe Diaz wants to put</v>

2960
02:08:19.961 --> 02:08:21.300
<v Speaker 6>some shit in the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh No,</v>

2961
02:08:21.320 --> 02:08:21.950
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

2962
02:08:21.950 --> 02:08:24.460
<v Speaker 6>don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You got to the end that we're going to</v>

2963
02:08:24.461 --> 02:08:25.810
<v Speaker 6>put my shit here,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and then you're like,</v>

2964
02:08:25.960 --> 02:08:26.950
<v Speaker 6>why would I put it?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Look Bro,</v>

2965
02:08:26.951 --> 02:08:28.360
<v Speaker 6>I don't have confidence in that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What the fuck?</v>

2966
02:08:28.480 --> 02:08:32.080
<v Speaker 6>And then you would argue over how the</v>
<v Speaker 6>material gets delivered as long as Joe</v>

2967
02:08:32.080 --> 02:08:34.930
<v Speaker 6>Diaz was in charge of you went out and</v>
<v Speaker 6>hired a bunch of stuff,</v>

2968
02:08:34.960 --> 02:08:36.730
<v Speaker 6>they brought you things and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>

2969
02:08:36.731 --> 02:08:38.020
<v Speaker 6>this is good.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's good.</v>

2970
02:08:38.021 --> 02:08:39.160
<v Speaker 6>I feel comfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is.</v>

2971
02:08:39.161 --> 02:08:41.650
<v Speaker 6>I would say this and I'll put my own</v>
<v Speaker 6>flavor into this,</v>

2972
02:08:41.651 --> 02:08:43.750
<v Speaker 6>my own spin on that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>As long as you.</v>

2973
02:08:43.780 --> 02:08:45.430
<v Speaker 6>It comes from a singular voice.</v>

2974
02:08:45.430 --> 02:08:46.181
<v Speaker 6>Sure,</v>
<v Speaker 6>sure,</v>

2975
02:08:46.181 --> 02:08:46.991
<v Speaker 6>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Absolutely.</v>

2976
02:08:46.991 --> 02:08:48.750
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You guys are just enlightened me.</v>

2977
02:08:48.770 --> 02:08:51.370
<v Speaker 6>I built around you for 10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You might.</v>

2978
02:08:51.400 --> 02:08:54.040
<v Speaker 6>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Your best friends that you get open mic</v>

2979
02:08:54.041 --> 02:08:56.020
<v Speaker 6>with.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Some of them are writers now,</v>

2980
02:08:56.021 --> 02:08:58.270
<v Speaker 6>some of them,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but Chris Mcguire,</v>

2981
02:08:58.300 --> 02:09:01.270
<v Speaker 6>some of them fucking came up to you a</v>
<v Speaker 6>couple of times and said something.</v>

2982
02:09:01.280 --> 02:09:03.560
<v Speaker 6>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this motherfucker militiaman yeah,</v>

2983
02:09:03.620 --> 02:09:07.090
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Sometimes it's better just to settle</v>

2984
02:09:07.091 --> 02:09:11.020
<v Speaker 6>down and take and you might not use it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but he might open up a door for you</v>

2985
02:09:11.021 --> 02:09:12.640
<v Speaker 6>where your voice fits.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2986
02:09:12.760 --> 02:09:15.250
<v Speaker 6>and that's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Sometimes you have to learn how to,</v>

2987
02:09:15.251 --> 02:09:17.530
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>collaboration is a very important thing.</v>

2988
02:09:17.531 --> 02:09:18.910
<v Speaker 6>It's a very interesting thing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but no,</v>

2989
02:09:18.911 --> 02:09:20.740
<v Speaker 6>I mean that's.</v>
<v Speaker 6>These podcasts are essentially 100</v>

2990
02:09:20.741 --> 02:09:23.660
<v Speaker 6>percent collaboration.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The little rants sweet.</v>

2991
02:09:23.710 --> 02:09:26.680
<v Speaker 6>Go on little rants things come out of</v>
<v Speaker 6>them and stuff like that.</v>

2992
02:09:26.680 --> 02:09:28.450
<v Speaker 6>That wasn't normal.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Exactly.</v>

2993
02:09:29.170 --> 02:09:30.370
<v Speaker 6>When you're talking about nervous,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I do.</v>

2994
02:09:30.371 --> 02:09:33.250
<v Speaker 6>You get randomly,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I get nervous in the craziest things.</v>

2995
02:09:33.290 --> 02:09:37.330
<v Speaker 6>What you'll be doing a television shows</v>
<v Speaker 6>zero nerve and then it's second show</v>

2996
02:09:37.331 --> 02:09:39.180
<v Speaker 6>Saturday.</v>
<v Speaker 6>For some reason my heart,</v>

2997
02:09:39.181 --> 02:09:41.350
<v Speaker 6>I feel like it's pounding out of the</v>
<v Speaker 6>chest really.</v>

2998
02:09:41.380 --> 02:09:43.510
<v Speaker 6>And then a Friday first show,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no nerves.</v>

2999
02:09:43.540 --> 02:09:45.090
<v Speaker 6>I do a little bit of rituals,</v>
<v Speaker 6>estate,</v>

3000
02:09:45.091 --> 02:09:47.730
<v Speaker 6>state kind of focus to get me in like a</v>
<v Speaker 6>really good mood.</v>

3001
02:09:47.731 --> 02:09:49.630
<v Speaker 6>So when I get on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm not phoning it in,</v>

3002
02:09:49.780 --> 02:09:53.260
<v Speaker 6>but as far as physical like I need to</v>
<v Speaker 6>wear one of those,</v>

3003
02:09:53.261 --> 02:09:56.850
<v Speaker 6>a body bugs,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would like to split those up to get</v>

3004
02:09:56.860 --> 02:09:58.540
<v Speaker 6>those things.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Now you can do your heart rate,</v>

3005
02:09:58.570 --> 02:10:01.180
<v Speaker 6>calories and stuff and you hook it up to</v>
<v Speaker 6>your computer real.</v>

3006
02:10:01.210 --> 02:10:03.040
<v Speaker 6>You wear it for like all week and it</v>
<v Speaker 6>gives you.</v>

3007
02:10:03.500 --> 02:10:05.030
<v Speaker 6>Is it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Does it work while you're exercising?</v>

3008
02:10:05.030 --> 02:10:06.160
<v Speaker 6>Because one,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was stupid.</v>

3009
02:10:06.161 --> 02:10:10.120
<v Speaker 6>It goes around your waist in snow.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They have new ones that go on your bio</v>

3010
02:10:10.330 --> 02:10:12.330
<v Speaker 6>that are supposed to be really good and</v>
<v Speaker 6>you could fully exercise.</v>

3011
02:10:12.331 --> 02:10:13.760
<v Speaker 6>Like I got punched the bag and shit with</v>
<v Speaker 6>that.</v>

3012
02:10:14.070 --> 02:10:14.710
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

3013
02:10:14.710 --> 02:10:15.680
<v Speaker 6>it's like A.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3014
02:10:17.050 --> 02:10:19.090
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I like to wear one just to see what my</v>

3015
02:10:19.091 --> 02:10:22.640
<v Speaker 6>heart rate does before shows and see</v>
<v Speaker 6>what kind of calories you burn.</v>

3016
02:10:22.641 --> 02:10:25.740
<v Speaker 6>Do you ever look at it while you're</v>
<v Speaker 6>looking at pictures that no,</v>

3017
02:10:25.770 --> 02:10:28.570
<v Speaker 6>I want to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That was a goddamn good line.</v>

3018
02:10:28.620 --> 02:10:30.850
<v Speaker 6>Joey talked right over on the stock.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I liked it,</v>

3019
02:10:31.050 --> 02:10:32.230
<v Speaker 6>but it wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What was it said?</v>

3020
02:10:32.231 --> 02:10:34.880
<v Speaker 6>Do you ever look at that while you're</v>
<v Speaker 6>looking at pictures of caulk and see</v>

3021
02:10:34.881 --> 02:10:36.380
<v Speaker 6>what your heart rate does?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's all right man.</v>

3022
02:10:36.381 --> 02:10:37.730
<v Speaker 6>Don't worry about USB on a horse</v>

3023
02:10:37.870 --> 02:10:39.160
<v Speaker 8>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

3024
02:10:39.240 --> 02:10:41.560
<v Speaker 8>I guess you can use it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Seeing it with you're watching porn.</v>

3025
02:10:42.720 --> 02:10:45.330
<v Speaker 8>Just</v>
<v Speaker 8>gymnastics.</v>

3026
02:10:45.340 --> 02:10:48.250
<v Speaker 8>Horse is not even a real horse behind</v>
<v Speaker 8>me.</v>

3027
02:10:49.010 --> 02:10:53.810
<v Speaker 6>I look at things and look at when there</v>
<v Speaker 6>was a time when the store became second</v>

3028
02:10:53.811 --> 02:10:56.150
<v Speaker 6>nature to me.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Joe would call me and go,</v>

3029
02:10:56.151 --> 02:11:00.290
<v Speaker 6>you go on up before me and there was</v>
<v Speaker 6>like a fucking store and I would go down</v>

3030
02:11:00.291 --> 02:11:03.920
<v Speaker 6>there and I wouldn't feel anything.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would go up on stage and literally</v>

3031
02:11:03.921 --> 02:11:07.820
<v Speaker 6>fucking bomb bomb bomb and getting my</v>
<v Speaker 6>car didn't give a fuck.</v>

3032
02:11:08.480 --> 02:11:12.160
<v Speaker 6>And then it's times when the audience I</v>
<v Speaker 6>feed off the energy.</v>

3033
02:11:12.161 --> 02:11:14.060
<v Speaker 6>It's like one them to the ocean near</v>
<v Speaker 6>that you're sitting in,</v>

3034
02:11:14.330 --> 02:11:17.720
<v Speaker 6>these waves are hitting you but there's</v>
<v Speaker 6>some shit coming at you and sometimes</v>

3035
02:11:17.721 --> 02:11:20.420
<v Speaker 6>you get to a show and I got to see the</v>
<v Speaker 6>audience,</v>

3036
02:11:20.630 --> 02:11:23.450
<v Speaker 6>like seeing the audience and let me know</v>
<v Speaker 6>these motherfuckers paid.</v>

<v Speaker 6>and just get.</v>

3038
02:11:26.720 --> 02:11:30.050
<v Speaker 6>I see people on the plane sometimes I'll</v>
<v Speaker 6>psych myself up.</v>

3039
02:11:30.050 --> 02:11:33.170
<v Speaker 6>Now I'm throwing different point.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like now I want to go out there and die</v>

3040
02:11:33.171 --> 02:11:34.880
<v Speaker 6>on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We were in Milwaukee.</v>

3041
02:11:34.881 --> 02:11:37.070
<v Speaker 6>Let me just tell you ever had a heart</v>
<v Speaker 6>attack on stage.</v>

<v Speaker 6>But if I do it,</v>

3043
02:11:38.661 --> 02:11:42.500
<v Speaker 6>I'm doing it because I like what's going</v>
<v Speaker 6>on right now with comedy and my wife and</v>

3044

<v Speaker 6>I don't want it to fuck around no more.</v>

3046
02:11:49.580 --> 02:11:52.210
<v Speaker 6>I want to be nervous to the point where</v>
<v Speaker 6>my palm sweat a little bit.</v>

3047

02:12:43.331 --> 02:12:46.780
<v Speaker 8>wars were [inaudible] about to fight the</v>
<v Speaker 8>system and there's a force field in</v>

3069
02:12:46.781 --> 02:12:49.720
<v Speaker 8>front of him and he's.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And he's rocking like just get the.</v>

3070
02:12:49.810 --> 02:12:54.250
<v Speaker 8>I do that to myself now before.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Well I was just crazy pump up like I was</v>

3071
02:12:54.251 --> 02:12:57.070
<v Speaker 8>going to ask you this because you do</v>
<v Speaker 8>that neuro linguistic programming,</v>

3072
02:12:57.071 --> 02:12:58.030
<v Speaker 8>right?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

3073
02:12:58.050 --> 02:13:01.120
<v Speaker 8>and you,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you have like a certain thing you do</v>

3074
02:13:01.121 --> 02:13:02.980
<v Speaker 8>right before you go onstage.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That puts you in a,</v>

3075
02:13:02.981 --> 02:13:05.800
<v Speaker 8>like a perfect state of mind was at work</v>
<v Speaker 8>always.</v>

3076
02:13:05.920 --> 02:13:06.520
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>What I do,</v>

3077
02:13:06.520 --> 02:13:07.920
<v Speaker 8>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's um,</v>

3078
02:13:08.530 --> 02:13:09.850
<v Speaker 8>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and then I was doing it wrong.</v>

3079
02:13:09.850 --> 02:13:12.280
<v Speaker 8>We're a buddy actually say you shouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 8>make it rich.</v>

3080
02:13:12.310 --> 02:13:15.110
<v Speaker 8>Which realistic,</v>
<v Speaker 8>whatever that word is I was talking to</v>

3081
02:13:15.610 --> 02:13:17.560
<v Speaker 8>you shouldn't do it or now you're</v>
<v Speaker 8>developing.</v>

3082
02:13:17.561 --> 02:13:21.520
<v Speaker 8>And so what I do is I imagined the</v>
<v Speaker 8>greatest show ever,</v>

3083
02:13:21.521 --> 02:13:24.160
<v Speaker 8>just literally because your brain</v>
<v Speaker 8>doesn't know,</v>

3084
02:13:24.180 --> 02:13:24.780
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

3085
02:13:24.780 --> 02:13:26.530
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>something that didn't happen to you.</v>

3086
02:13:26.531 --> 02:13:30.340
<v Speaker 8>If I was asked you tell me about lunch</v>
<v Speaker 8>you had with your family yesterday and</v>

3087
02:13:30.341 --> 02:13:35.070
<v Speaker 8>you told me you couldn't really tell me</v>
<v Speaker 8>the way the launch actually went down.</v>

3088
02:13:35.100 --> 02:13:39.660
<v Speaker 8>You've deleted distorted and generalized</v>
<v Speaker 8>every situation in your life to what's</v>

3089
02:13:39.661 --> 02:13:40.740
<v Speaker 8>important to you.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Right.</v>

3090
02:13:40.980 --> 02:13:43.530
<v Speaker 8>Where I could ask,</v>
<v Speaker 8>let's say your wife tell me about lunch</v>

3091
02:13:43.531 --> 02:13:46.440
<v Speaker 8>and she would almost give me,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it'd be similar,</v>

3092
02:13:46.441 --> 02:13:50.340
<v Speaker 8>but maybe she was paying attention to</v>
<v Speaker 8>the TV that was on above you and in your</v>

3093
02:13:50.341 --> 02:13:51.870
<v Speaker 8>store.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You didn't tell me about the TV.</v>

3094
02:13:52.290 --> 02:13:55.380
<v Speaker 8>It's kind of what people are,</v>
<v Speaker 8>what you're looking out for because you</v>

3095
02:13:55.381 --> 02:13:56.214
<v Speaker 8>have a.</v>

3096
02:13:56.250 --> 02:13:58.040
<v Speaker 8>This is wrong numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but like $70,</v>

3097
02:13:58.041 --> 02:14:01.590
<v Speaker 8>billion bits of information your body's</v>
<v Speaker 8>trying to figure out.</v>

3098
02:14:01.690 --> 02:14:04.560
<v Speaker 8>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And you narrow that down to seven plus</v>

3099
02:14:04.561 --> 02:14:08.160
<v Speaker 8>or minus two pieces of info at any given</v>
<v Speaker 8>moment.</v>

3100
02:14:08.220 --> 02:14:09.750
<v Speaker 8>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like if I was asking you what's the</v>

3101
02:14:09.751 --> 02:14:11.400
<v Speaker 8>temperature like in here?</v>
<v Speaker 8>How's the temperature?</v>

3102
02:14:11.490 --> 02:14:13.830
<v Speaker 8>Unless you are focused on it,</v>
<v Speaker 8>unless you were sweaty,</v>

3103
02:14:14.010 --> 02:14:16.920
<v Speaker 8>the temperature might not even been in</v>
<v Speaker 8>the equation.</v>

3104
02:14:16.921 --> 02:14:19.350
<v Speaker 8>Why we're having this conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So with that,</v>

3105
02:14:19.560 --> 02:14:23.520
<v Speaker 8>I imagined the greatest show ever,</v>
<v Speaker 8>like my greatest show ever.</v>

3106
02:14:23.521 --> 02:14:27.480
<v Speaker 8>And I kind of remind some last comment</v>
<v Speaker 8>because there was that feeling of big</v>

3107
02:14:27.481 --> 02:14:32.010
<v Speaker 8>light shit falling from the thing when I</v>
<v Speaker 8>really felt eh and right when I get to</v>

3108
02:14:32.011 --> 02:14:33.690
<v Speaker 8>that state,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I squeeze my thumb.</v>

3109
02:14:33.691 --> 02:14:37.170
<v Speaker 8>I put my thumb in between my fist like</v>
<v Speaker 8>spiderman and squeeze it yet.</v>

3110
02:14:37.230 --> 02:14:38.430
<v Speaker 8>Or you're shooting on a web?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yes,</v>

3111
02:14:38.431 --> 02:14:39.000
<v Speaker 8>exactly.</v>

3112
02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:40.380
<v Speaker 8>That's exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You put it there.</v>

3113
02:14:40.410 --> 02:14:40.981
<v Speaker 8>How did he do it?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Now?</v>

3114
02:14:40.981 --> 02:14:42.370
<v Speaker 8>You did it like two fingers like this,</v>
<v Speaker 8>right?</v>

3115
02:14:42.410 --> 02:14:42.970
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

3116
02:14:42.970 --> 02:14:45.130
<v Speaker 8>Well My.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Because you don't let them enter the.</v>

3117
02:14:45.240 --> 02:14:45.570
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

3118
02:14:45.570 --> 02:14:47.880
<v Speaker 8>He went like this.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Or if I had the things as a kid who</v>

3119
02:14:47.881 --> 02:14:50.820
<v Speaker 8>needs prayer,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but I put it here and then I imagine</v>

3120
02:14:50.821 --> 02:14:55.010
<v Speaker 8>that you get that feeling because now</v>
<v Speaker 8>your brain imagines that awesome thing</v>

3121
02:14:55.090 --> 02:14:57.870
<v Speaker 8>and I lock it in like a speed dot.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Then what happened?</v>

3122
02:14:57.890 --> 02:15:00.570
<v Speaker 8>Just covering your thumb because you</v>
<v Speaker 8>want it,</v>

3123
02:15:00.571 --> 02:15:02.810
<v Speaker 8>like fighters use it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Sometimes fighters have a thing.</v>

3124
02:15:02.860 --> 02:15:05.490
<v Speaker 8>You do it in a.</v>
<v Speaker 8>In a movement that you don't replicate</v>

3125
02:15:05.520 --> 02:15:07.290
<v Speaker 8>on a normal basis.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We don't do it.</v>

3126
02:15:07.291 --> 02:15:09.870
<v Speaker 8>I it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So I squeeze my thumb and then sometimes</v>

3127
02:15:09.871 --> 02:15:13.230
<v Speaker 8>when I'm in an awesome mood or even if I</v>
<v Speaker 8>come home and my dogs,</v>

3128
02:15:13.231 --> 02:15:14.290
<v Speaker 8>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they're tag,</v>

3129
02:15:14.490 --> 02:15:17.370
<v Speaker 8>their tails are wagon and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>oh this is great.</v>

3130
02:15:17.580 --> 02:15:19.850
<v Speaker 8>I'll squeeze my thumb and when I'm on</v>
<v Speaker 8>stage,</v>

3131
02:15:19.870 --> 02:15:24.060
<v Speaker 8>if I get a big laugh and get an a or say</v>
<v Speaker 8>something that was really funny,</v>

3132
02:15:24.300 --> 02:15:26.460
<v Speaker 8>I'll squeeze my thumb.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So it's like a bank account.</v>

3133
02:15:26.461 --> 02:15:29.460
<v Speaker 8>You put happy feelings or good feelings</v>
<v Speaker 8>into that thumb.</v>

3134
02:15:29.580 --> 02:15:33.150
<v Speaker 8>So then the for the days when you don't</v>
<v Speaker 8>feel like going on stage or you got into</v>

3135
02:15:33.151 --> 02:15:35.010
<v Speaker 8>an argument right before you went on</v>
<v Speaker 8>stage,</v>

3136
02:15:35.160 --> 02:15:38.250
<v Speaker 8>like self up gnosis is squeeze that</v>
<v Speaker 8>thumb and it puts you right back to that</v>

3137
02:15:38.251 --> 02:15:39.420
<v Speaker 8>place.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Just like a song.</v>

3138
02:15:39.560 --> 02:15:42.270
<v Speaker 8>It's called anchoring.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Just like if you hear a song from back</v>

3139
02:15:42.271 --> 02:15:44.810
<v Speaker 8>in the day,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you can remember a girlfriend or.</v>

3140
02:15:44.811 --> 02:15:46.890
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So what you're doing is you're adding</v>

3141
02:15:46.891 --> 02:15:50.250
<v Speaker 8>your sp dial to tyricine.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Whether here's the deal,</v>

3142
02:15:50.330 --> 02:15:51.030
<v Speaker 8>if,</v>
<v Speaker 8>if you,</v>

3143
02:15:51.030 --> 02:15:53.310
<v Speaker 8>if you think it works,</v>
<v Speaker 8>then it completely works,</v>

3144
02:15:53.311 --> 02:15:55.350
<v Speaker 8>which means you just have to convince</v>
<v Speaker 8>yourself that it works.</v>

3145
02:15:55.940 --> 02:15:57.910
<v Speaker 3>I see you're not wearing your balance</v>
<v Speaker 3>bracelets.</v>

3146
02:15:58.870 --> 02:16:00.560
<v Speaker 3>And when I was at the mall the other</v>
<v Speaker 3>day,</v>

3147
02:16:00.650 --> 02:16:04.100
<v Speaker 3>some guy was trying to sell me on it and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I asked if you've got a balance bracelet</v>

3148
02:16:04.101 --> 02:16:06.600
<v Speaker 3>on both hands if it's better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he said yes,</v>

3149
02:16:09.690 --> 02:16:13.080
<v Speaker 4>well this is recorded,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's people that actually believe</v>

3150
02:16:13.081 --> 02:16:15.210
<v Speaker 4>in that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Shane Carwyn believed in that shit.</v>

3151
02:16:15.211 --> 02:16:18.120
<v Speaker 4>But here's the crazy part about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of the things that are ropes of</v>

3152
02:16:18.140 --> 02:16:19.680
<v Speaker 4>Judaism from the forum,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3153
02:16:19.690 --> 02:16:23.190
<v Speaker 4>filled the English dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He posted on the forum an interesting</v>

3154
02:16:23.191 --> 02:16:26.850
<v Speaker 4>observation that this guy had where</v>
<v Speaker 4>people have done studies and showed that</v>

3155
02:16:26.851 --> 02:16:30.010
<v Speaker 4>they actually did help athletic</v>
<v Speaker 4>performance and the reason</v>

3156
02:16:30.010 --> 02:16:35.010
<v Speaker 1>is because people thought they helped</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that is somehow enough even ready</v>

3157
02:16:35.321 --> 02:16:37.510
<v Speaker 1>for this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if you know it's bullshit.</v>

3158
02:16:37.780 --> 02:16:42.160
<v Speaker 1>Even people that knew it was bullshit</v>
<v Speaker 1>and knew there was no physical way that</v>

3159
02:16:42.161 --> 02:16:44.980
<v Speaker 1>this bracelet could give you better</v>
<v Speaker 1>balance and make you athletic.</v>

3160
02:16:45.070 --> 02:16:47.080
<v Speaker 1>Athletical athletically performed</v>
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>

3161
02:16:47.260 --> 02:16:50.650
<v Speaker 1>They would give it to people and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>would still find significant benefit in</v>

3162
02:16:50.651 --> 02:16:54.340
<v Speaker 1>it like somehow or another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just opening the door to something</v>

3163
02:16:54.341 --> 02:16:57.070
<v Speaker 1>making you better can make you better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or what happens is a lot of times when</v>

3164
02:16:57.071 --> 02:16:59.980
<v Speaker 1>you start talking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's talk about nerves or shitty.</v>

3165
02:17:00.040 --> 02:17:01.960
<v Speaker 1>If we keep it the show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're starting,</v>

3166
02:17:02.010 --> 02:17:03.010
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the show sucks.</v>

3167
02:17:03.160 --> 02:17:04.350
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that person's probably going to</v>

3168
02:17:04.351 --> 02:17:06.070
<v Speaker 1>heckle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what happens is as you talked</v>

3169
02:17:06.071 --> 02:17:08.980
<v Speaker 1>yourself into a really shitty show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like do that.</v>

3170
02:17:08.981 --> 02:17:11.110
<v Speaker 1>You talk yourself into people that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>going no,</v>

3171
02:17:11.111 --> 02:17:14.170
<v Speaker 1>but I will play scenario scenarios out</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my head.</v>

3172
02:17:14.540 --> 02:17:15.580
<v Speaker 1>You you play like,</v>

3173
02:17:15.690 --> 02:17:20.690
<v Speaker 4>like heckles fas having,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm not saying just for a second</v>

3174
02:17:23.130 --> 02:17:23.840
<v Speaker 4>because Brian,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

3175
02:17:23.840 --> 02:17:26.730
<v Speaker 4>you're really new to the game or you've</v>
<v Speaker 4>only been doing comedy like a little bit</v>

3176
02:17:26.731 --> 02:17:29.460
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean really over the last couple of</v>

3177
02:17:29.460 --> 02:17:31.050
<v Speaker 4>years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Over this nine years off that you had,</v>

3178
02:17:31.260 --> 02:17:34.500
<v Speaker 4>do you ever before you go on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you should be nervous as fuck.</v>

3179
02:17:34.740 --> 02:17:36.570
<v Speaker 4>Do you ever go on stage and said</v>
<v Speaker 4>nervous?</v>

<v Speaker 4>they're nervous to tell you so much.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I mean people will say that Brian had</v>

<v Speaker 4>him to his face.</v>

<v Speaker 4>One time we were in,</v>

3193
02:18:16.160 --> 02:18:19.910
<v Speaker 4>we were in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we were in Austin one night and he came</v>

3194
02:18:19.911 --> 02:18:21.940
<v Speaker 4>up to me afterwards like I and he's</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

3195
02:18:22.340 --> 02:18:25.610

<v Speaker 4>Howard because that's fun and I didn't</v>

3196
02:18:25.611 --> 02:18:26.510
<v Speaker 4>give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's true.</v>

3197
02:18:26.511 --> 02:18:27.620
<v Speaker 4>That joke didn't work,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's.</v>

3198
02:18:27.920 --> 02:18:32.360
<v Speaker 4>Brian has balls of steel now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Lane never complained to me.</v>

3199
02:18:32.450 --> 02:18:33.283
<v Speaker 4>Never ever.</v>

3200
02:18:33.590 --> 02:18:36.540
<v Speaker 1>He had been off for nine years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had an any six years,</v>

3201
02:18:36.610 --> 02:18:38.400
<v Speaker 1>six years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no standup at all.</v>

3202
02:18:38.460 --> 02:18:43.460
<v Speaker 1>He got up at a midnight show in Atlanta,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Georgia at a UFC punchline in Atlanta.</v>

3203
02:18:46.200 --> 02:18:47.490
<v Speaker 1>That's a fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

3204
02:18:47.491 --> 02:18:51.270
<v Speaker 1>that's a bad ass old school club.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To have that club,</v>

3205
02:18:51.271 --> 02:18:55.500
<v Speaker 1>to go up for your first time and on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sold out show on a fucking Friday night,</v>

3206
02:18:55.501 --> 02:18:57.600
<v Speaker 1>a late night show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>midnight show.</v>

3207
02:18:58.050 --> 02:19:00.780
<v Speaker 1>Fucking goes onstage and kills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only did he kill,</v>

3208
02:19:00.840 --> 02:19:03.990
<v Speaker 1>he pulled himself out of a downward</v>
<v Speaker 1>spiral like you did.</v>

3209
02:19:03.991 --> 02:19:07.020
<v Speaker 1>Really good in the beginning and then he</v>
<v Speaker 1>started bombing and he figured out a way</v>

3210
02:19:07.021 --> 02:19:09.180
<v Speaker 1>to pull himself out of the bombing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know why?</v>

3211
02:19:09.420 --> 02:19:12.330
<v Speaker 1>Because he doesn't have a lot of ego.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you have a lot of ego,</v>

3212
02:19:12.331 --> 02:19:15.630
<v Speaker 1>that's when you can never pull out of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bombing person who like takes themselves</v>

3213
02:19:15.631 --> 02:19:18.570
<v Speaker 1>super seriously and then it gets</v>
<v Speaker 1>devastated onstage by,</v>

3214
02:19:18.760 --> 02:19:20.370
<v Speaker 1>by a joke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>joking those.</v>

3215
02:19:20.380 --> 02:19:21.690
<v Speaker 1>The people that can't pull out a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bombing.</v>

3216
02:19:21.720 --> 02:19:25.640
<v Speaker 1>Come to a point in my life when I got</v>
<v Speaker 1>another fucking email about standup one</v>

3217
02:19:25.650 --> 02:19:28.280
<v Speaker 1>another twit and you put me off</v>

3218
02:19:28.280 --> 02:19:30.860
<v Speaker 7>or people come up to you and talk to you</v>
<v Speaker 7>and put you off.</v>

3219
02:19:31.250 --> 02:19:32.360
<v Speaker 7>I'm at the point.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Stand up.</v>

3220
02:19:32.361 --> 02:19:34.100
<v Speaker 7>I want to just say get the fuck away</v>
<v Speaker 7>from me.</v>

3221
02:19:34.370 --> 02:19:39.370
<v Speaker 7>So whenever I see somebody like Brian do</v>
<v Speaker 7>the standup Brown and gold bottom ball</v>

3222
02:19:40.020 --> 02:19:40.950
<v Speaker 7>lists,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3223
02:19:41.030 --> 02:19:43.640
<v Speaker 7>because it's completely out of Brian</v>
<v Speaker 7>where he just goes up.</v>

3224
02:19:44.750 --> 02:19:46.280
<v Speaker 7>I love him.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I love him.</v>

3225
02:19:46.281 --> 02:19:48.170
<v Speaker 7>Just for that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I give them that respect because I know</v>

3226
02:19:48.171 --> 02:19:51.680
<v Speaker 7>how hard it is and I know how many</v>
<v Speaker 7>exclusives we've all heard and we don't</v>

3227
02:19:51.681 --> 02:19:53.840
<v Speaker 7>give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 7>All I want you to do is be happy.</v>

3228
02:19:53.841 --> 02:19:55.550
<v Speaker 7>If you come up to me and say you want to</v>
<v Speaker 7>get on stage,</v>

3229
02:19:55.850 --> 02:19:58.430
<v Speaker 7>I'll give you all the love I can to get</v>
<v Speaker 7>you up to that stage,</v>

3230
02:19:58.640 --> 02:20:01.130
<v Speaker 7>but don't let me see your three months</v>
<v Speaker 7>later and you still bullshitting me</v>

3231
02:20:01.340 --> 02:20:03.410
<v Speaker 7>because I did that too.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It took me six months,</v>

3232
02:20:03.710 --> 02:20:06.860
<v Speaker 7>took me six months of canceling at the</v>
<v Speaker 7>comedy works and then show it up and</v>

3233
02:20:06.861 --> 02:20:08.300
<v Speaker 7>finally doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Then you get hope,</v>

3234
02:20:08.750 --> 02:20:11.970
<v Speaker 7>but I do give you a lot of love for that</v>
<v Speaker 7>brand.</v>

3235
02:20:12.140 --> 02:20:14.140
<v Speaker 7>Probably one of the reasons why he</v>
<v Speaker 7>talked to this,</v>

3236
02:20:14.150 --> 02:20:17.220
<v Speaker 7>because you don't give a fuck when it</v>
<v Speaker 7>comes to stand up and as soon as he gets</v>

3237
02:20:17.221 --> 02:20:19.260
<v Speaker 7>to a stage your walk at them and say,</v>
<v Speaker 7>where's the drink ticket?</v>

3238
02:20:19.390 --> 02:20:20.223
<v Speaker 7>Bitch?</v>

3239
02:20:20.850 --> 02:20:23.610
<v Speaker 1>As a kid I used to do open mic nights</v>
<v Speaker 1>with back in Boston.</v>

3240
02:20:23.611 --> 02:20:26.370
<v Speaker 1>Route was kind of half ass in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the beginning I was into it,</v>

3241
02:20:26.371 --> 02:20:28.890
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't into it because I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>still fighting at the time and I was</v>

3242
02:20:28.891 --> 02:20:31.950
<v Speaker 1>still working full time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so still fighting kickboxing tournament</v>

3243
02:20:31.951 --> 02:20:33.930
<v Speaker 1>and shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I was training I pretty much every</v>

3244
02:20:33.930 --> 02:20:36.840
<v Speaker 1>night and then trying to go do standup</v>
<v Speaker 1>afterwards so I was fucking tired all</v>

3245
02:20:36.841 --> 02:20:39.060
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was burning the fuse at both ends and</v>

3246
02:20:39.061 --> 02:20:41.250
<v Speaker 1>some fucking kid that I did open mic</v>
<v Speaker 1>nights with goes,</v>

3247
02:20:41.520 --> 02:20:43.140
<v Speaker 1>you're pretty funny when you first</v>
<v Speaker 1>started out man,</v>

3248
02:20:43.141 --> 02:20:47.310
<v Speaker 1>but you seem to have kind of fizzled and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's being honest with me and I stopped</v>

3249
02:20:47.311 --> 02:20:48.300
<v Speaker 1>and I thought about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

3250
02:20:48.301 --> 02:20:50.250
<v Speaker 1>Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3251
02:20:50.251 --> 02:20:52.110
<v Speaker 1>he's just like saying it like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're really funny.</v>

3252
02:20:52.111 --> 02:20:54.330
<v Speaker 1>In the beginning he kind of fizzled and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't argue with them back,</v>

3253
02:20:54.331 --> 02:20:55.920
<v Speaker 1>which is what I normally would have</v>
<v Speaker 1>done,</v>

3254
02:20:55.940 --> 02:20:56.910
<v Speaker 1>but I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck you.</v>

3255
02:20:57.100 --> 02:20:58.020
<v Speaker 1>And I thought about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

3256
02:20:58.021 --> 02:20:59.550
<v Speaker 1>God damn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's probably right.</v>

3257
02:20:59.910 --> 02:21:01.390
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck am I doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't.</v>

3258
02:21:01.510 --> 02:21:03.680
<v Speaker 1>I had a guy say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he came and saw me in Austin,</v>

3259
02:21:03.690 --> 02:21:06.210
<v Speaker 1>a friend of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he did show it and I thought it was</v>

3260
02:21:06.211 --> 02:21:08.310
<v Speaker 1>a good show and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen you like a bunch of times.</v>

3261
02:21:08.311 --> 02:21:10.710
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've done comedy for 23 years,</v>

3262
02:21:11.150 --> 02:21:14.010
<v Speaker 1>you need to rip it every time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I immediate,</v>

3263
02:21:14.011 --> 02:21:16.050
<v Speaker 1>you need to rip it every time to rip it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3264
02:21:16.051 --> 02:21:17.010
<v Speaker 1>just crush.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

3265
02:21:17.011 --> 02:21:18.120
<v Speaker 1>you know why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was probably saying that his</v>

3266
02:21:18.121 --> 02:21:22.100
<v Speaker 1>girlfriend wanted to fuck you or</v>
<v Speaker 1>motivated me because then I started</v>

3267
02:21:22.101 --> 02:21:25.400
<v Speaker 1>going know that crowd just kind of then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I'm making all the excuses.</v>

3268
02:21:25.401 --> 02:21:26.990
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3269
02:21:27.120 --> 02:21:28.060
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3270
02:21:28.310 --> 02:21:30.120
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a point where I switched off,</v>

3271
02:21:30.450 --> 02:21:34.900
<v Speaker 1>maybe start phoning it in and then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then that's when I choose my thumb,</v>

3272
02:21:35.250 --> 02:21:36.390
<v Speaker 1>but some shows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you're going to have to suck your thumb.</v>

3274

<v Speaker 1>Do I suck my.</v>

<v Speaker 7>Don't.</v>

3277
02:21:43.230 --> 02:21:44.730

<v Speaker 7>I was when I was a kid,</v>

3295
02:22:19.070 --> 02:22:23.710

<v Speaker 6>Do you want to know?</v>

3304
02:22:40.020 --> 02:22:42.570

<v Speaker 6>200.</v>

02:22:48.450 --> 02:22:51.150
<v Speaker 6>200 hits in those.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do you know how ridiculous that is?</v>

3308
02:22:51.470 --> 02:22:55.890
<v Speaker 6>That one thing you could carry that</v>
<v Speaker 6>around for you for days for you.</v>

3309
02:22:56.160 --> 02:22:59.150
<v Speaker 6>You could carry that shit around for</v>
<v Speaker 6>days and just get bullied.</v>

3310
02:22:59.190 --> 02:23:00.420
<v Speaker 6>So you put the weed in there.</v>

3311
02:23:00.510 --> 02:23:02.300
<v Speaker 8>No preloaded,</v>
<v Speaker 8>preloaded,</v>

3312
02:23:02.301 --> 02:23:06.320
<v Speaker 8>and it's like a poll.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That shit for preload and it has all to</v>

3313
02:23:06.321 --> 02:23:08.600
<v Speaker 8>about $200.</v>
<v Speaker 8>When you draw it for two to three</v>

3314
02:23:08.601 --> 02:23:10.280
<v Speaker 8>seconds,</v>
<v Speaker 8>two weeks,</v>

3315
02:23:10.281 --> 02:23:13.850
<v Speaker 8>you got to charge it and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 8>This is amazing.</v>

3316
02:23:13.880 --> 02:23:15.280
<v Speaker 8>This is.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You don't need a lie.</v>

3317
02:23:15.290 --> 02:23:18.210
<v Speaker 8>That is a super blue dream.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Where do you get this from?</v>

3318
02:23:18.760 --> 02:23:21.080
<v Speaker 8>The shop?</v>
<v Speaker 8>The only two or three seconds.</v>

3319
02:23:21.410 --> 02:23:22.640
<v Speaker 8>It's called an m,</v>
<v Speaker 8>e,</v>

3320
02:23:22.641 --> 02:23:25.880
<v Speaker 8>d.</v>
<v Speaker 8>A stick as tea is amazing.</v>

3321
02:23:25.881 --> 02:23:29.570
<v Speaker 8>It doesn't smell at all except for when</v>
<v Speaker 8>you you you have it.</v>

3322
02:23:29.571 --> 02:23:32.210
<v Speaker 8>The problem is you can never smell weed</v>
<v Speaker 8>when you're smoking weed.</v>

3323
02:23:32.211 --> 02:23:37.211
<v Speaker 8>You don't smell it plain.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't think you could do it on a plane</v>

3324
02:23:37.251 --> 02:23:39.410
<v Speaker 8>because something's coming out and</v>
<v Speaker 8>that's something we'll probably set up</v>

3325
02:23:39.411 --> 02:23:40.820
<v Speaker 8>the alarm.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So what I did here,</v>

3326
02:23:41.070 --> 02:23:43.020
<v Speaker 8>it's water vapor,</v>
<v Speaker 8>water vapor,</v>

3327
02:23:43.030 --> 02:23:44.780
<v Speaker 8>back.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Why do we need to do the water?</v>

3328
02:23:44.781 --> 02:23:49.100
<v Speaker 8>Vapor is for the cigarette.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They do it so people get the whole</v>

3329
02:23:49.101 --> 02:23:50.660
<v Speaker 8>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You see the fake read,</v>

3330
02:23:50.750 --> 02:23:53.870
<v Speaker 8>you go in and then you see the fake</v>
<v Speaker 8>reds.</v>

3331
02:23:53.871 --> 02:23:54.651
<v Speaker 8>Hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

3332
02:23:54.651 --> 02:23:58.580
<v Speaker 8>You see the and then you blow it out.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So people who want to not smoke,</v>

3333
02:23:58.700 --> 02:24:00.230
<v Speaker 8>they that you've gone through the whole</v>
<v Speaker 8>motion,</v>

<v Speaker 8>you see that,</v>

<v Speaker 6>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 6>to get done.</v>

3417
02:27:33.261 --> 02:27:35.870
<v Speaker 6>So this is the question that I had.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm thinking about.</v>

3418
02:27:35.871 --> 02:27:39.890
<v Speaker 6>I'm thinking about opening a comedy club</v>
<v Speaker 6>and been thinking about that for the</v>

3419
02:27:39.890 --> 02:27:41.510
<v Speaker 6>last couple of weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've been telling you that for years.</v>

3420
02:27:41.570 --> 02:27:42.470
<v Speaker 6>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You have been.</v>

3421
02:27:42.471 --> 02:27:45.260
<v Speaker 6>You've been telling me about.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We talked about buying the ice house at</v>

3422
02:27:45.261 --> 02:27:48.230
<v Speaker 6>one point in time when they were trying</v>
<v Speaker 6>to sell the ice house and like maybe</v>

3423
02:27:48.231 --> 02:27:49.850
<v Speaker 6>what,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what would it be like to buy a comedy</v>

3424
02:27:49.851 --> 02:27:51.100
<v Speaker 6>club?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What city would you do it?</v>

3425
02:27:51.140 --> 02:27:52.870
<v Speaker 6>I don't know man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would have to have somebody fucking</v>

3426
02:27:52.880 --> 02:27:54.530
<v Speaker 6>run it though.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Somebody that I trust to run it.</v>

3427
02:27:54.531 --> 02:27:57.380
<v Speaker 6>That's the real problem because I ain't</v>
<v Speaker 6>got the time to really blessed to have a</v>

3428
02:27:57.381 --> 02:28:01.730
<v Speaker 6>club where we all had a vested interest</v>
<v Speaker 6>in and we all worked out there all the</v>

3429
02:28:01.731 --> 02:28:05.630
<v Speaker 6>time and we set it up the right way.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean essentially like the comedy store</v>

3430
02:28:05.631 --> 02:28:09.980
<v Speaker 6>was one of the greatest creative moments</v>
<v Speaker 6>for you and I and a lot of other</v>

3431
02:28:09.981 --> 02:28:11.420
<v Speaker 6>comedians,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but why was it?</v>

3432
02:28:11.520 --> 02:28:12.770
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's because there was a lot of great</v>

3433
02:28:12.771 --> 02:28:15.890
<v Speaker 6>comics hanging out there and basically</v>
<v Speaker 6>running the show.</v>

3434
02:28:15.890 --> 02:28:16.970
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's what it was.</v>

3435
02:28:17.180 --> 02:28:21.530
<v Speaker 6>It was a fun little club where we all</v>
<v Speaker 6>got in and fucked around and people knew</v>

3436
02:28:21.531 --> 02:28:24.650
<v Speaker 6>that they go there pretty much any</v>
<v Speaker 6>weekend and see some fun shit.</v>

3437
02:28:25.100 --> 02:28:27.530
<v Speaker 6>We need to recreate that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We can recreate that somewhere.</v>

3438
02:28:27.531 --> 02:28:31.230
<v Speaker 6>It wouldn't be that hard as long as we'd</v>
<v Speaker 6>all like small,</v>

3439
02:28:31.260 --> 02:28:34.940
<v Speaker 6>like $200 to $15 even.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's too much.</v>

3440
02:28:35.450 --> 02:28:37.250
<v Speaker 6>We don't want to compete with nobody,</v>
<v Speaker 6>by the way.</v>

3441
02:28:37.251 --> 02:28:38.430
<v Speaker 6>What's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Mad Dog.</v>
