1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.060
<v Speaker 1>Fresh back from her lion hunting safari in Africa.</v>

2
00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:03.931
<v Speaker 1>Esther,</v>

3
00:00:03.931 --> 00:00:04.231
<v Speaker 1>cool.</v>

4
00:00:04.231 --> 00:00:05.064
<v Speaker 1>You're here.</v>

5
00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:05.520
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

6
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.090
<v Speaker 1>I'm just this line mania today.</v>

7
00:00:09.091 --> 00:00:09.440
<v Speaker 1>I asked her,</v>

8
00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm paying attention is I can't know what happened with lions day,</v>

9
00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:13.920
<v Speaker 1>but some dude,</v>

10
00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:14.310
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

11
00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:15.143
<v Speaker 1>killed,</v>

12
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.660
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

13
00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.510
<v Speaker 1>like a loved lion that had a gps collar.</v>

14
00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:23.640
<v Speaker 1>They lured away from this protected area where it was living and he killed it</v>

15
00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:24.810
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

16
00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.960
<v Speaker 1>they tried to hide the fact that he killed it.</v>

17
00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.070
<v Speaker 1>He's a dentist in Minnesota.</v>

18
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:29.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

19
00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:30.713
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

20
00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:31.830
<v Speaker 1>It's a sad story.</v>

21
00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:34.290
<v Speaker 1>Tried to destroy the tracking device.</v>

22
00:00:34.291 --> 00:00:34.740
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

23
00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:35.860
<v Speaker 1>Why do you try to distort a track?</v>

24
00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.340
<v Speaker 1>Because he didn't want to people to know that he killed this lion.</v>

25
00:00:38.341 --> 00:00:39.780
<v Speaker 1>That was a protected line.</v>

26
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.530
<v Speaker 1>Apparently they lured it away from the protected area with the,</v>

27
00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:44.443
<v Speaker 1>with meat,</v>

28
00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:46.530
<v Speaker 1>it's still like drag meet behind a car.</v>

29
00:00:46.531 --> 00:00:49.710
<v Speaker 1>I like to put the sense so that this thing would fall a scent and smell it.</v>

30
00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.550
<v Speaker 1>And then he used a gps tracking device to find the line.</v>

31
00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:53.130
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

32
00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:53.371
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

33
00:00:53.371 --> 00:00:55.950
<v Speaker 1>they found that allegedly according to them,</v>

34
00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.550
<v Speaker 1>they found out that it had a tracking device after they killed it.</v>

35
00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.400
<v Speaker 1>So they didn't know that it was a protected lion.</v>

36
00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.043
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

37
00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.150
<v Speaker 1>well is it going to do with the lion?</v>

38
00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.560
<v Speaker 1>It's going to put it in his office.</v>

39
00:01:07.561 --> 00:01:08.790
<v Speaker 1>It just for the Instagram picture.</v>

40
00:01:08.791 --> 00:01:11.940
<v Speaker 1>That's why a lot of people were pissed off because it's like this beloved lion,</v>

41
00:01:11.941 --> 00:01:14.130
<v Speaker 1>but yet they're only doing it for like the photo,</v>

42
00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.700
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

43
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:15.090
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

44
00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.320
<v Speaker 1>he's got a trophy room,</v>

45
00:01:16.321 --> 00:01:16.860
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

46
00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.000
<v Speaker 1>cause he's killed everything.</v>

47
00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.950
<v Speaker 1>This guy's killed fucking everything.</v>

48
00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:20.310
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

49
00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.650
<v Speaker 1>I think Jimmy Kimmel said he killed half a Noah's Ark.</v>

50
00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.560
<v Speaker 1>Like literally it's fucked up.</v>

51
00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.380
<v Speaker 1>Jimmy Kimmel start crying when he's talking about it last night on TV.</v>

52
00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.030
<v Speaker 1>And I think it was legit.</v>

53
00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:31.410
<v Speaker 1>I know it was legit.</v>

54
00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:32.340
<v Speaker 1>He's on a bullshit artist.</v>

55
00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:33.623
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

58
00:01:34.711 --> 00:01:38.910
<v Speaker 1>he's a one of those trophy hunters that just wants to have these stuffed animals</v>

59
00:01:38.911 --> 00:01:39.744
<v Speaker 1>in a room.</v>

60
00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:40.700
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

65
00:01:45.541 --> 00:01:47.450
<v Speaker 1>he wants to come out and fly out and uh,</v>

74
00:01:51.251 --> 00:01:51.991
<v Speaker 1>he's one of those guys.</v>

75
00:01:51.991 --> 00:01:52.824
<v Speaker 1>We should go visit them.</v>

76
00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:53.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.160
<v Speaker 1>So where was his line killing?</v>

80
00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:57.000
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

81
00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.930
<v Speaker 1>it was in Africa,</v>

82
00:01:57.931 --> 00:01:58.770
<v Speaker 1>somewhere in Africa,</v>

83
00:01:58.771 --> 00:02:00.180
<v Speaker 1>which is a fucking huge place.</v>

84
00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.290
<v Speaker 1>Somewhere in Africa is like saying somewhere on earth.</v>

85
00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.420
<v Speaker 1>I think it was in Zimbabwe.</v>

86
00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.140
<v Speaker 1>Zimbabwe.</v>

87
00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:04.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

88
00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.740
<v Speaker 1>I want to know the two guys that dragged it out knew that this was about love</v>

89
00:02:07.741 --> 00:02:08.041
<v Speaker 1>line.</v>

90
00:02:08.041 --> 00:02:10.770
<v Speaker 1>Obviously if it was such a superhero in that that area,</v>

91
00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:11.670
<v Speaker 1>like they,</v>

92
00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.680
<v Speaker 1>it seems almost like a setup or something.</v>

93
00:02:13.681 --> 00:02:17.700
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how much of a superhero line is the people that live there to the</v>

94
00:02:17.701 --> 00:02:18.570
<v Speaker 1>people that live there.</v>

95
00:02:18.571 --> 00:02:19.780
<v Speaker 1>That's a fucking mind.</v>

96
00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.530
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

97
00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.870
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of the people that are like conservationists and are people that</v>

98
00:02:24.871 --> 00:02:28.980
<v Speaker 1>are tourists and are visiting and that's a love line that the beloved lion will</v>

99
00:02:28.981 --> 00:02:29.814
<v Speaker 1>kill you.</v>

100
00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.170
<v Speaker 1>Just like any regular line.</v>

101
00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.890
<v Speaker 1>It just not,</v>

102
00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:32.723
<v Speaker 1>it's not the line.</v>

103
00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:36.280
<v Speaker 2>Can you talk probably more mad at him then the woman who killed the giraffe.</v>

104
00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:36.911
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>

105
00:02:36.911 --> 00:02:37.430
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

106
00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.621
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

107
00:02:37.621 --> 00:02:39.190
<v Speaker 2>Cause there's no giraffe king.</v>

108
00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:40.343
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

109
00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.050
<v Speaker 2>You know in that moment with Simba,</v>

110
00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.251

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:42.920
<v Speaker 2>Like I forget what it was.</v>

296
00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:44.600
<v Speaker 2>My might've been,</v>

297
00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:45.620
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure.</v>

298
00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:46.380
<v Speaker 2>I'd be guessing.</v>

299
00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:47.061
<v Speaker 2>Was he bigger than,</v>

300
00:07:47.061 --> 00:07:47.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

301
00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:48.643
<v Speaker 2>it was not bigger than me.</v>

302
00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:50.443
<v Speaker 2>He wants to start a fight.</v>

303
00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:51.620
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you wanted to certify it.</v>

304
00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:55.630
<v Speaker 2>I think you just wanted to express just suggestion,</v>

305
00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:57.380
<v Speaker 2>your suggestion box to your face.</v>

306
00:07:57.470 --> 00:07:59.570
<v Speaker 2>It was really dumb because he was like,</v>

307
00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:02.240
<v Speaker 2>like if you were at a show and everybody else is enjoying it,</v>

308
00:08:02.241 --> 00:08:04.850
<v Speaker 2>it was all his laughter and all this fun going on.</v>

309
00:08:04.851 --> 00:08:05.540
<v Speaker 2>Then you're like,</v>

310
00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:05.871
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

311
00:08:05.871 --> 00:08:08.990
<v Speaker 2>you shouldn't be enjoying this because I don't like it.</v>

312
00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:10.041
<v Speaker 2>Like that's stupid.</v>

313
00:08:10.041 --> 00:08:10.730
<v Speaker 2>Just leave.</v>

314
00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:11.470
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

315
00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:13.580
<v Speaker 2>I've had people tell me that like,</v>

316
00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:18.980
<v Speaker 2>I would enjoy your act so much more if you didn't use so many curse words or</v>

317
00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:22.040
<v Speaker 2>didn't talk about like sex,</v>

318
00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:25.370
<v Speaker 2>you know the whole time and I'm just like,</v>

319
00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:26.510
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

320
00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:27.830
<v Speaker 2>what do you want me to talk about?</v>

321
00:08:27.831 --> 00:08:29.570
<v Speaker 2>Like that's just what I'm passionate about.</v>

322
00:08:29.571 --> 00:08:31.130
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes you're passionate about sex,</v>

323
00:08:31.131 --> 00:08:31.964
<v Speaker 2>it's beautiful.</v>

324
00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:35.153
<v Speaker 2>It's just for days</v>

325
00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:40.640
<v Speaker 2>now there's a lot of people they would like to present that sex doesn't exist</v>

326
00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:41.930
<v Speaker 2>because nobody wants to touch them.</v>

327
00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:43.790
<v Speaker 2>There's a little bit of that going on.</v>

328
00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:47.240
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of that going on for sure.</v>

329
00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:50.400
<v Speaker 2>But most people are passionate about sex now.</v>

330
00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:51.201
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot,</v>

331
00:08:51.201 --> 00:08:54.530
<v Speaker 2>but there's some people that don't like you to talk about it and that's like New</v>

332
00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:54.560
<v Speaker 2>England.</v>

333
00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:55.800
<v Speaker 2>Like that area.</v>

334
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:57.810
<v Speaker 4>That's a big thing down there.</v>

335
00:08:57.811 --> 00:09:01.200
<v Speaker 4>Like that's a very buttoned down town and the little very conservative and a lot</v>

336
00:09:01.201 --> 00:09:06.150
<v Speaker 4>of ways like everybody wears Khakis and like blue collared shirts from j crew,</v>

337
00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:09.570
<v Speaker 4>you know that's like the Boston uniform.</v>

338
00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:10.800
<v Speaker 4>There is a lot of that going on.</v>

339
00:09:10.801 --> 00:09:11.250
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

340
00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:11.731
<v Speaker 4>it's a very,</v>

341
00:09:11.731 --> 00:09:14.370
<v Speaker 4>because it's in a lot of ways it's a liberal town,</v>

342
00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:15.300
<v Speaker 4>a democratic town,</v>

343
00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:19.620
<v Speaker 4>start comedy in because they're so tight that you make them laugh and then you</v>

344
00:09:19.621 --> 00:09:20.341
<v Speaker 4>go somewhere it will be like,</v>

345
00:09:20.341 --> 00:09:20.581
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

346
00:09:20.581 --> 00:09:21.600
<v Speaker 4>this is so easy.</v>

347
00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:23.110
<v Speaker 4>Those Boston people are so hard.</v>

348
00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:23.910
<v Speaker 1>There's some,</v>

349
00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:24.990
<v Speaker 1>some of them are tighten up,</v>

350
00:09:24.991 --> 00:09:25.291
<v Speaker 1>tie in.</v>

351
00:09:25.291 --> 00:09:26.550
<v Speaker 1>The other ones are mean and drunk.</v>

352
00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:31.710
<v Speaker 1>So you got two good groups to pull from the drunk Irish people.</v>

353
00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:32.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

354
00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:34.050
<v Speaker 1>Well it's a good spot to start that,</v>

355
00:09:34.051 --> 00:09:34.290
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

356
00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:38.100
<v Speaker 1>that Cambridge place was known to be like a good little spot.</v>

357
00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:38.963
<v Speaker 1>That's Rick Jenkins,</v>

358
00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:39.770
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

359
00:09:39.770 --> 00:09:40.071
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

360
00:09:40.071 --> 00:09:40.431
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

361
00:09:40.431 --> 00:09:41.360
<v Speaker 4>I feel like he could,</v>

362
00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:43.100
<v Speaker 4>he could have like a big comedy club.</v>

363
00:09:43.101 --> 00:09:43.341
<v Speaker 4>He like,</v>

364
00:09:43.341 --> 00:09:45.440
<v Speaker 4>he always prided himself and not advertising.</v>

365
00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:46.131
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

366
00:09:46.131 --> 00:09:47.870
<v Speaker 4>we don't advertise it and look,</v>

367
00:09:47.871 --> 00:09:50.930
<v Speaker 4>there's still 20 people here on a Saturday night.</v>

368
00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:51.921
<v Speaker 4>And I'm like,</v>

369
00:09:51.921 --> 00:09:53.230
<v Speaker 4>you should advertise.</v>

370
00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:53.780
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

371
00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:57.770
<v Speaker 4>you can make so much money if you like grew the club because yeah,</v>

372
00:09:57.771 --> 00:09:58.850
<v Speaker 4>it's been there for awhile.</v>

373
00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:01.490
<v Speaker 1>People have very strange ways of looking at things.</v>

374
00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:03.230
<v Speaker 1>Then they just decided this is the way,</v>

375
00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:04.093
<v Speaker 1>oh look,</v>

376

<v Speaker 1>I'm always aren't this way.</v>

377
00:10:05.210 --> 00:10:05.990
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

378
00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:06.910
<v Speaker 1>Not Advertising it.</v>

379
00:10:06.911 --> 00:10:08.420
<v Speaker 1>Comedy Club seems pretty silly.</v>

380
00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:10.580
<v Speaker 1>Like how the fuck is people were supposed to,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

389
00:10:14.881 --> 00:10:15.930
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't make any sense.</v>

390
00:10:15.931 --> 00:10:16.764

614
00:17:32.111 --> 00:17:34.210
<v Speaker 2>I drink this tea called Mata de Coco.</v>

615
00:17:34.211 --> 00:17:37.210
<v Speaker 2>It's made out of cocoa leaves and I couldn't shut the fuck up.</v>

616
00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:40.540
<v Speaker 2>I did it with a Stan hope and I remember I kept telling him,</v>

617
00:17:40.541 --> 00:17:40.841

619
00:17:42.250 --> 00:17:43.150
<v Speaker 2>This is driving me crazy.</v>

620
00:17:43.290 --> 00:17:44.380
<v Speaker 2>And you're aware of it?</v>

<v Speaker 2>it's terrible.</v>

623
00:17:45.191 --> 00:17:46.270
<v Speaker 2>It's the worst drug for me.</v>

624
00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:48.090
<v Speaker 2>It's horrible because it's like,</v>

625
00:17:48.091 --> 00:17:50.150
<v Speaker 2>it's the are like escaping.</v>

626
00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:52.700
<v Speaker 4>It makes you stay up so late that it does that.</v>

627
00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:55.410
<v Speaker 4>Like you're just the whole next two days that are just wasted.</v>

628
00:17:55.411 --> 00:17:57.420
<v Speaker 4>You can't be productive with anything.</v>

629
00:17:57.940 --> 00:17:58.271
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

630
00:17:58.271 --> 00:18:01.180
<v Speaker 6>I have a friend who just did ecstasy and he said the same thing,</v>

631
00:18:01.181 --> 00:18:02.170
<v Speaker 6>said after it was over,</v>

632
00:18:02.171 --> 00:18:04.750
<v Speaker 6>like the next day he felt so shitty.</v>

633
00:18:05.170 --> 00:18:05.621
<v Speaker 6>He's like,</v>

634
00:18:05.621 --> 00:18:05.910
<v Speaker 6>I could,</v>

635
00:18:05.910 --> 00:18:06.743
<v Speaker 6>he couldn't do anything.</v>

636
00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:08.490
<v Speaker 3>There's a way to do ecstasy,</v>

637
00:18:08.491 --> 00:18:09.090
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

638
00:18:09.090 --> 00:18:09.810
<v Speaker 3>New Mood,</v>

639
00:18:09.810 --> 00:18:11.940
<v Speaker 3>take a shit load of new mood before you go to bed.</v>

640
00:18:11.941 --> 00:18:16.170
<v Speaker 3>Just see like vitamin C and that's one of those things where you can do it</v>

641
00:18:16.171 --> 00:18:16.621
<v Speaker 3>correctly.</v>

642
00:18:16.621 --> 00:18:17.070
<v Speaker 3>And I've known,</v>

643
00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:19.680
<v Speaker 3>I've had it where I've woken up and hadn't to zero hangovers.</v>

644
00:18:19.730 --> 00:18:20.563

645
00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:21.300
<v Speaker 6>fit though.</v>

646
00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:24.000

00:18:24.030 --> 00:18:24.510
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

648
00:18:24.510 --> 00:18:27.600

649
00:18:27.601 --> 00:18:28.470
<v Speaker 6>takes care of his body.</v>

650
00:18:28.471 --> 00:18:32.910
<v Speaker 6>Like the kind of heat when he really feels like a shitty day or as you booze it</v>

651
00:18:32.911 --> 00:18:34.050
<v Speaker 6>up all the time,</v>

702
00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:46.250
<v Speaker 4>You know the surgery costs don't you</v>

703
00:19:46.530 --> 00:19:48.260
<v Speaker 6>really close to some artificial lens.</v>

704
00:19:48.261 --> 00:19:50.030
<v Speaker 6>Did you see that thing that they had on the Internet recently?</v>

705
00:19:50.031 --> 00:19:52.670
<v Speaker 6>They are creating some artificial lens for the human eye.</v>

706
00:19:52.671 --> 00:19:54.540
<v Speaker 6>That's way better than any vision [inaudible]</v>

707
00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:55.433
<v Speaker 3>you'll ever have.</v>

708
00:19:55.850 --> 00:19:56.641
<v Speaker 3>I thought they already had that.</v>

709
00:19:56.641 --> 00:19:57.920
<v Speaker 3>Didn't they have their first implant?</v>

710
00:19:58.010 --> 00:19:58.790
<v Speaker 6>I don't know,</v>

711
00:19:58.790 --> 00:20:02.090
<v Speaker 6>but there's some new one that they've developed some artificial lens.</v>

712
00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:03.410
<v Speaker 6>See if you can find it,</v>

713
00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:04.460
<v Speaker 6>but they,</v>

714
00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:05.930
<v Speaker 6>there was some talk about it.</v>

715
00:20:05.931 --> 00:20:06.261
<v Speaker 6>They were like,</v>

716
00:20:06.261 --> 00:20:07.640
<v Speaker 6>why would you Catlins no,</v>

717
00:20:07.641 --> 00:20:09.800
<v Speaker 6>it's going to be like something they insert into your eyes.</v>

718
00:20:09.801 --> 00:20:10.430
<v Speaker 6>Your eye.</v>

719
00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:10.760
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

720
00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:11.900
<v Speaker 6>They're going to do surgery on you.</v>

721
00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:13.330
<v Speaker 4>What do you think about?</v>

722
00:20:13.331 --> 00:20:16.900
<v Speaker 4>What do you think about people who want to put chips and kids to prevent</v>

723
00:20:17.050 --> 00:20:19.870
<v Speaker 4>kidnappings or to be able to find your kid?</v>

724
00:20:20.550 --> 00:20:23.700
<v Speaker 6>It sounds like a great idea if that's what it does.</v>

725
00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:26.900
<v Speaker 6>If it prevents kidnapping and so he could find new kid.</v>

726
00:20:26.910 --> 00:20:30.360
<v Speaker 6>The problem comes when people use it for other reasons,</v>

727
00:20:30.361 --> 00:20:35.361
<v Speaker 6>like to know where your kids are because I don't like you or to know where your</v>

728
00:20:36.391 --> 00:20:38.100
<v Speaker 6>kid is when they become an adult.</v>

729
00:20:38.170 --> 00:20:41.400
<v Speaker 6>Maybe someone doesn't like their opinion on something or maybe they're about to</v>

730
00:20:41.401 --> 00:20:44.550
<v Speaker 6>expose some business corruption or government corruption.</v>

731
00:20:44.551 --> 00:20:46.170
<v Speaker 6>When people know where they are at all times,</v>

732
00:20:46.770 --> 00:20:47.950
<v Speaker 6>that seems fucked up.</v>

733
00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:52.480
<v Speaker 6>It just seems fucked up because we can't quite track everything that everybody</v>

734
00:20:52.481 --> 00:20:53.020
<v Speaker 6>does.</v>

735
00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:55.780
<v Speaker 6>I think eventually we'll be able to track everything everybody does all the</v>

736
00:20:55.781 --> 00:20:56.310
<v Speaker 6>time.</v>

737
00:20:56.310 --> 00:20:58.630
<v Speaker 6>Like this is radio lab show called eye in the sky.</v>

738
00:20:58.660 --> 00:20:59.190
<v Speaker 6>What is this?</v>

739
00:20:59.190 --> 00:21:00.090
<v Speaker 6>The implant is that,</v>

740
00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:00.760
<v Speaker 6>what does it say?</v>

741
00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:01.593
<v Speaker 6>It's treated.</v>

742
00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:02.160
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

743
00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:06.010
<v Speaker 6>BC optometrist sees way for bionic Lens and plant.</v>

744
00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:10.030
<v Speaker 6>Imagine seeing three times better than 2020 vision.</v>

745
00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:12.130
<v Speaker 6>Even at the age of a hundred or more.</v>

746
00:21:14.110 --> 00:21:14.950
<v Speaker 6>That's the future.</v>

747
00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:18.220
<v Speaker 6>So this radio lab podcast called the eye in the sky,</v>

748
00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:18.700
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

749
00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:18.911
<v Speaker 6>is,</v>

750
00:21:18.911 --> 00:21:20.110
<v Speaker 6>I think that's the name of the episode.</v>

751
00:21:20.111 --> 00:21:21.880
<v Speaker 6>And it's all about these,</v>

752
00:21:22.490 --> 00:21:26.290
<v Speaker 6>this technology they developed that they put on planes and they fly these planes</v>

753
00:21:26.291 --> 00:21:30.790
<v Speaker 6>overhead and they take detailed images of everything on the ground.</v>

754
00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:32.530
<v Speaker 6>So they do it like click,</v>

755
00:21:32.531 --> 00:21:32.831
<v Speaker 6>click,</v>

756
00:21:32.831 --> 00:21:33.101
<v Speaker 6>click,</v>

757
00:21:33.101 --> 00:21:34.750
<v Speaker 6>like it's constantly as it's flying,</v>

758
00:21:34.751 --> 00:21:36.490
<v Speaker 6>taking millions and millions of photos.</v>

759
00:21:36.610 --> 00:21:38.200
<v Speaker 6>So if something happens,</v>

760
00:21:38.410 --> 00:21:41.620
<v Speaker 6>what they can do is find out where it happened when it happened,</v>

761
00:21:41.650 --> 00:21:45.280
<v Speaker 6>then go to the eye in the sky footage that go to that section of the footage.</v>

762
00:21:45.281 --> 00:21:45.521
<v Speaker 6>They go,</v>

763
00:21:45.521 --> 00:21:46.240
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>

764
00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:48.100
<v Speaker 6>let's take it to three 30 today.</v>

765
00:21:48.130 --> 00:21:48.520
<v Speaker 6>Yup.</v>

766
00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:49.390
<v Speaker 6>There's the car,</v>

767
00:21:49.690 --> 00:21:51.130
<v Speaker 6>there's the guy who gets out of the car,</v>

768
00:21:51.250 --> 00:21:52.360
<v Speaker 6>there's a guy getting shot.</v>

769
00:21:52.390 --> 00:21:53.920
<v Speaker 6>The guy gets back in the car and drives off.</v>

770
00:21:53.921 --> 00:21:56.200
<v Speaker 6>Let's find out where the cargo is and they just follow the car.</v>

771
00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:56.660
<v Speaker 6>They,</v>

772
00:21:56.660 --> 00:21:59.740
<v Speaker 6>so they have all the images of everything that's happening and they're going to</v>

773
00:21:59.741 --> 00:22:03.490
<v Speaker 6>use this in places like Iraq and they're going to try to use this in places like</v>

774
00:22:03.491 --> 00:22:07.480
<v Speaker 6>Detroit and places where there's a lot of crime and a lot of violence,</v>

775
00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:08.531
<v Speaker 6>but you know,</v>

776
00:22:08.531 --> 00:22:10.780
<v Speaker 6>people are resisting it obviously because they're going to,</v>

777
00:22:10.810 --> 00:22:12.410
<v Speaker 6>they're going to catch people doing all kinds of stuff.</v>

778
00:22:12.411 --> 00:22:14.770
<v Speaker 6>They're going to catch people cheating on their wives and their husbands are</v>

779
00:22:14.771 --> 00:22:16.470
<v Speaker 6>going to catch people stealing from work.</v>

780
00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:18.640
<v Speaker 6>They're going to catch people not feeling like work.</v>

781
00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:18.911
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

782
00:22:18.911 --> 00:22:19.570
<v Speaker 6>Fill in the blank.</v>

783
00:22:19.570 --> 00:22:21.550
<v Speaker 6>You say you're here but you're there.</v>

784
00:22:21.610 --> 00:22:23.080
<v Speaker 6>Someone's going to have access to it.</v>

785
00:22:23.081 --> 00:22:24.730
<v Speaker 6>You said you couldn't work because of this,</v>

786
00:22:24.731 --> 00:22:26.320
<v Speaker 6>but we have footage of you at home.</v>

787
00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:28.300
<v Speaker 6>It's just gets weird.</v>

788
00:22:28.301 --> 00:22:32.080
<v Speaker 6>It gets weird when someone can just find where you are all the time.</v>

789
00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:34.630
<v Speaker 6>But it kind of seems like that's where it's going.</v>

790
00:22:35.050 --> 00:22:36.460
<v Speaker 6>It kind of seems right there.</v>

791
00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:37.393
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

792
00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:38.500
<v Speaker 4>almost.</v>

793
00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:38.970
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

794
00:22:38.970 --> 00:22:39.660
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

795
00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:43.830
<v Speaker 4>like my problem with like putting chips in kids is that like,</v>

796
00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:44.191
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

797
00:22:44.191 --> 00:22:44.630
<v Speaker 4>so the,</v>

798
00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:46.530
<v Speaker 4>it'll prevent people from predators,</v>

799
00:22:46.531 --> 00:22:47.580
<v Speaker 4>from the kidnapping kids,</v>

800
00:22:47.581 --> 00:22:48.001
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>

801
00:22:48.001 --> 00:22:53.001
<v Speaker 4>But what if he finds where the chip is and then like scrapes it up.</v>

802
00:22:54.270 --> 00:22:54.961
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

803
00:22:54.961 --> 00:22:58.650
<v Speaker 4>Like he could hurt the child if it's like implanted in their skin.</v>

804
00:22:59.080 --> 00:22:59.831
<v Speaker 6>That's true.</v>

805
00:22:59.831 --> 00:23:03.370
<v Speaker 6>But I don't think you're going to save that kid by not having it in their skin</v>

806
00:23:03.371 --> 00:23:06.610
<v Speaker 6>when he's going to fuck the kid and kill him or whatever the hell he's going to</v>

807
00:23:06.611 --> 00:23:06.990
<v Speaker 6>do.</v>

808
00:23:06.990 --> 00:23:07.420
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

809
00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:08.020
<v Speaker 6>You know what I mean?</v>

810
00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:08.860
<v Speaker 6>I see what you're saying.</v>

811
00:23:08.861 --> 00:23:10.420
<v Speaker 6>Like someone would want to cut it out,</v>

812
00:23:10.421 --> 00:23:11.740
<v Speaker 6>but if they could find it,</v>

813
00:23:11.741 --> 00:23:14.710
<v Speaker 6>it's kind of person who would cut an implant out of a kid is not planning on</v>

814
00:23:14.711 --> 00:23:15.131
<v Speaker 6>doing,</v>

815
00:23:15.131 --> 00:23:15.690
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>

816
00:23:15.690 --> 00:23:15.880
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

817
00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:16.511
<v Speaker 6>other than that,</v>

818
00:23:16.511 --> 00:23:18.850
<v Speaker 6>my intentions are completely altruistic.</v>

819
00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:21.110
<v Speaker 6>I fucking hate chips.</v>

820
00:23:21.970 --> 00:23:23.680
<v Speaker 6>I just have to cut the chip out of this kid.</v>

821
00:23:24.130 --> 00:23:25.540
<v Speaker 6>You're dealing with it.</v>

822
00:23:25.541 --> 00:23:29.200
<v Speaker 6>So it's a weird privacy issue that I think eventually it's going to get to a</v>

823
00:23:29.201 --> 00:23:29.401
<v Speaker 6>point,</v>

824
00:23:29.401 --> 00:23:33.040
<v Speaker 6>it was going to be a moot point because there's going to be so much access to</v>

825
00:23:33.041 --> 00:23:34.300
<v Speaker 6>where everybody is all the time.</v>

826
00:23:34.750 --> 00:23:35.650
<v Speaker 6>It's going to be pointless.</v>

827
00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:35.781
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

828
00:23:35.781 --> 00:23:35.960
<v Speaker 6>like</v>

829
00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:38.330
<v Speaker 4>these cameras are just getting more and more HD.</v>

830
00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:40.850
<v Speaker 4>But like you'll be up to like just take,</v>

831
00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:41.631
<v Speaker 4>take out your phone,</v>

832
00:23:41.631 --> 00:23:45.590
<v Speaker 4>take a picture and like you're in line at Starbucks or whatever and pulls out</v>

833
00:23:45.591 --> 00:23:46.070
<v Speaker 4>their credit card</v>

834
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:46.401
<v Speaker 1>to pay.</v>

835
00:23:46.401 --> 00:23:49.400
<v Speaker 1>You'll be able to take a picture and then just know that that person's whole</v>

836
00:23:49.401 --> 00:23:50.240
<v Speaker 1>credit card number,</v>

837
00:23:50.810 --> 00:23:51.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

838
00:23:51.510 --> 00:23:53.840
<v Speaker 1>like you're going to be able to zoom in so much.</v>

839
00:23:53.841 --> 00:23:57.530
<v Speaker 1>Like this thing is going to get more and more spreading the fingers.</v>

840
00:23:57.650 --> 00:23:58.483
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

841
00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:00.550
<v Speaker 1>They used that um,</v>

842
00:24:00.790 --> 00:24:05.790
<v Speaker 1>are in the sky thing in Juarez to catch this man who had killed this,</v>

843
00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:11.420
<v Speaker 1>a female police officer that shot this female police officer or may or something</v>

844
00:24:11.421 --> 00:24:11.990
<v Speaker 1>like that,</v>

845
00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:14.180
<v Speaker 1>some female person in charge.</v>

846
00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:16.940
<v Speaker 1>And when they shot her,</v>

847
00:24:16.970 --> 00:24:21.110
<v Speaker 1>they followed the car back to this house and then they backed up and they were</v>

848
00:24:21.111 --> 00:24:23.420
<v Speaker 1>able to follow all these other cars back to the house too.</v>

849
00:24:23.421 --> 00:24:28.340
<v Speaker 1>And it turns out this is his house that was filled with a drug cartel members</v>

850
00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:33.640
<v Speaker 1>and they were hit men and they would just run around doing murders and robbing</v>

851
00:24:34.131 --> 00:24:36.140
<v Speaker 1>people and they were all hold up in this one house,</v>

852
00:24:36.141 --> 00:24:37.040
<v Speaker 1>like a fucking movie.</v>

853
00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:39.650
<v Speaker 1>And so they just stormed the house and arrested everybody.</v>

854
00:24:40.350 --> 00:24:42.890
<v Speaker 1>So they're trying to use it as like one of those things where the saying that</v>

855
00:24:42.891 --> 00:24:46.570
<v Speaker 1>this is eventually going to be something that comes in very handy and it's going</v>

856
00:24:46.571 --> 00:24:47.300
<v Speaker 1>to be everywhere.</v>

857
00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:49.520
<v Speaker 1>How's that eye in the sky deal with clouds?</v>

858
00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:51.740
<v Speaker 1>Like if it's like an Ohio could be cloudy for a week.</v>

859
00:24:52.010 --> 00:24:52.701
<v Speaker 1>It's a good question.</v>

860
00:24:52.701 --> 00:24:55.880
<v Speaker 1>I mean they probably fly under the crowds if possible.</v>

861
00:24:56.510 --> 00:24:57.343
<v Speaker 1>If not,</v>

862
00:24:57.530 --> 00:24:58.730
<v Speaker 1>there's probably nothing they could do.</v>

863
00:24:59.120 --> 00:24:59.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

864
00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:03.500
<v Speaker 1>So if you're going to want be at the farriers criminal live in Ohio in the</v>

865
00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:03.501
<v Speaker 1>winter,</v>

866
00:25:03.501 --> 00:25:04.100
<v Speaker 1>cloudy day.</v>

867
00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:04.933
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

868
00:25:05.170 --> 00:25:06.003
<v Speaker 3>it's a good point.</v>

869
00:25:07.310 --> 00:25:08.540
<v Speaker 3>You could just put those chips,</v>

870
00:25:08.541 --> 00:25:08.980
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

871
00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:12.230
<v Speaker 3>and the kids putting them on their Dicks of a kidnapper takes the baby.</v>

872
00:25:12.231 --> 00:25:14.450
<v Speaker 3>They're not going to ruin the best part of the baby that you know.</v>

873
00:25:14.451 --> 00:25:15.800

886
00:25:35.281 --> 00:25:36.114
<v Speaker 1>This is perfect.</v>

887
00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:37.620
<v Speaker 3>What did you,</v>

888
00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:39.970
<v Speaker 3>we talked briefly last night about that alien,</v>

889
00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:40.950
<v Speaker 3>that CIA,</v>

890
00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:44.260
<v Speaker 3>it's just hilarious story.</v>

891
00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:45.370
<v Speaker 3>It's a really interesting,</v>

892
00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:47.410
<v Speaker 3>and if you listen to the interview of the,</v>

893
00:25:47.470 --> 00:25:49.630
<v Speaker 3>supposedly this guy died,</v>

894
00:25:49.660 --> 00:25:53.680
<v Speaker 3>they found him in an SUV in the Pacific Palisades and he was,</v>

895
00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:55.540
<v Speaker 3>had been there I guess for four days.</v>

896
00:25:55.570 --> 00:26:00.570
<v Speaker 3>And what happened is his girlfriend knew that he died and thought he was a half</v>

897
00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:06.040
<v Speaker 3>a hybrid of an alien and a a CIA agent.</v>

898
00:26:06.190 --> 00:26:06.881
<v Speaker 3>So he thought,</v>

899
00:26:06.881 --> 00:26:08.920
<v Speaker 3>she thought she better leave the body.</v>

900
00:26:08.921 --> 00:26:10.600
<v Speaker 3>The government knows he's dead.</v>

901
00:26:10.601 --> 00:26:10.900
<v Speaker 3>He'll,</v>

902
00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:13.900
<v Speaker 3>they'll take care of the body because he's not supposed to know it exists type</v>

903
00:26:13.901 --> 00:26:14.410
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

904
00:26:14.410 --> 00:26:17.170
<v Speaker 3>So went up to Washington and uh,</v>

905
00:26:17.310 --> 00:26:17.980
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

906
00:26:17.980 --> 00:26:19.630
<v Speaker 3>the cops found the body.</v>

907
00:26:19.750 --> 00:26:21.970
<v Speaker 3>He's been there forever and they go into his house.</v>

908
00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:24.670
<v Speaker 3>He has millions of dollars worth of guns.</v>

909
00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:27.940
<v Speaker 3>And then he also has large amounts of cash everywhere.</v>

910
00:26:28.660 --> 00:26:29.493
<v Speaker 3>That's what they're saying.</v>

911
00:26:29.810 --> 00:26:31.250
<v Speaker 3>Thousand 200 guns.</v>

912
00:26:31.251 --> 00:26:32.310
<v Speaker 3>It's not millions of dollars.</v>

913
00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:35.020
<v Speaker 3>They said last night on the news that it was a a collection.</v>

914
00:26:35.021 --> 00:26:35.854
<v Speaker 3>We're chameleons</v>

915
00:26:35.980 --> 00:26:38.270
<v Speaker 1>a million if each guy is worth 1000 bucks.</v>

916
00:26:38.271 --> 00:26:38.710
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

917
00:26:38.710 --> 00:26:42.520
<v Speaker 3>I guess some of them are just really like antiques I collectors and stuff like</v>

918
00:26:42.521 --> 00:26:42.760
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

919
00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:46.890
<v Speaker 3>It's like huge collection so it doesn't look like he's like was a broke,</v>

920
00:26:46.891 --> 00:26:47.311
<v Speaker 3>broke,</v>

921
00:26:47.311 --> 00:26:48.144
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

922
00:26:48.510 --> 00:26:51.030
<v Speaker 3>And $230,000 in cash.</v>

923
00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:54.060
<v Speaker 3>14 vehicles stashed around Los Angeles.</v>

924
00:26:54.090 --> 00:26:56.910
<v Speaker 3>14 vehicles registered to him,</v>

925
00:26:56.970 --> 00:26:59.270
<v Speaker 3>including an SUV designed to drive under water.</v>

926
00:27:00.790 --> 00:27:03.600
<v Speaker 3>He's a nut and the SUV to drive under the water.</v>

927
00:27:03.601 --> 00:27:05.650
<v Speaker 3>It's something that this new ABC seven,</v>

928
00:27:05.651 --> 00:27:08.790
<v Speaker 3>it's just blowing up a portion that's actually a common thing that you put on</v>

929
00:27:08.791 --> 00:27:09.780
<v Speaker 3>the bottom of the SUV.</v>

930
00:27:09.781 --> 00:27:12.060
<v Speaker 3>So when you run over a puddle as it doesn't flood out,</v>

931
00:27:12.061 --> 00:27:13.350
<v Speaker 3>the engine will sort of,</v>

932
00:27:13.351 --> 00:27:13.621
<v Speaker 3>it's not,</v>

933
00:27:13.621 --> 00:27:14.580
<v Speaker 3>you don't put it on the bottom,</v>

934
00:27:14.581 --> 00:27:15.450
<v Speaker 3>it's a snorkel,</v>

935
00:27:15.451 --> 00:27:17.730
<v Speaker 3>it goes out the the front fender.</v>

936
00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:18.120
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

937
00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:19.530
<v Speaker 3>It's real common for uh,</v>

938
00:27:20.130 --> 00:27:22.980
<v Speaker 3>like off road vehicles like Lang Rovers,</v>

939
00:27:22.981 --> 00:27:23.920
<v Speaker 3>like defenders,</v>

940
00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:25.260
<v Speaker 3>those Land Rover defenders.</v>

941
00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:28.350
<v Speaker 3>So that thing with a big pipe tube that comes off the side of the car,</v>

942
00:27:28.530 --> 00:27:29.330
<v Speaker 3>you seem in jeep,</v>

943
00:27:29.330 --> 00:27:31.770
<v Speaker 3>sometimes a Toyota land cruisers,</v>

944
00:27:31.771 --> 00:27:33.180
<v Speaker 3>a lot of times they hooked those up with them.</v>

945
00:27:33.390 --> 00:27:34.260
<v Speaker 3>People just like it.</v>

946
00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:35.730
<v Speaker 3>They like the fact they could just,</v>

947
00:27:35.790 --> 00:27:36.221
<v Speaker 3>I could float,</v>

948
00:27:36.221 --> 00:27:38.580
<v Speaker 3>can drive underwater bitch play this video.</v>

949
00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:39.360
<v Speaker 3>I want to hear this</v>

00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:42.300
<v Speaker 7>1200 guns.</v>

952
00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:43.193
<v Speaker 7>That seems a little,</v>

953
00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:45.720
<v Speaker 7>a little excessive commercial,</v>

954

00:27:50.370 --> 00:27:53.850
<v Speaker 3>they haven't really released a picture of him or any news and he's had prior</v>

958
00:27:53.851 --> 00:27:55.500
<v Speaker 3>convictions where he's gotten off,</v>

959
00:27:55.770 --> 00:27:59.790

00:28:02.791 --> 00:28:04.200
<v Speaker 3>I believe at lax or something.</v>

965
00:28:04.201 --> 00:28:07.500
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of message boards that are really digging into this guy and</v>

<v Speaker 7>The guys are drinking scotch or his fiance's home in Pacific Palisades.</v>

00:29:04.630 --> 00:29:07.350
<v Speaker 7>A story her attorney found a bit far fetched.</v>

992
00:29:08.340 --> 00:29:09.430
<v Speaker 7>Thought he was crazy.</v>

993
00:29:09.740 --> 00:29:10.930
<v Speaker 7>It sounded crazy to me.</v>

994
00:29:11.230 --> 00:29:11.931

<v Speaker 7>He refused nine one one.</v>

1001
00:29:26.951 --> 00:29:28.540
<v Speaker 7>He didn't want to go to the emergency room.</v>

1002
00:29:29.110 --> 00:29:30.250
<v Speaker 7>He didn't want any police,</v>

1003
00:29:30.251 --> 00:29:31.300
<v Speaker 7>so he died there.</v>

<v Speaker 7>governmental projects,</v>

00:29:59.471 --> 00:30:02.400
<v Speaker 1>They traveled bunker to Oregon to forget about what happened.</v>

1018
00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:06.270
<v Speaker 1>Never on returned two weeks later and was stunned at what she found.</v>

1019
00:30:06.380 --> 00:30:07.310
<v Speaker 7>When she got back.</v>

1020
00:30:08.570 --> 00:30:11.840
<v Speaker 7>The body was still in the car and that's when she decided she better call a</v>

1021
00:30:11.841 --> 00:30:12.580
<v Speaker 7>lawyer.</v>

1022
00:30:12.580 --> 00:30:15.490
<v Speaker 1>Ron says when he thought the police had guns,</v>

1023
00:30:15.790 --> 00:30:20.440
<v Speaker 1>six and a half tons of ammunition and $230,000 in cash.</v>

1024
00:30:20.790 --> 00:30:23.650
<v Speaker 1>That bunker was found alive and well in a motel in Oregon.</v>

1025
00:30:23.890 --> 00:30:24.371
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

1026
00:30:24.371 --> 00:30:25.001
<v Speaker 1>vet bunkers.</v>

1027
00:30:25.001 --> 00:30:27.850
<v Speaker 1>Mother adds another twist about Jeffrey Lash.</v>

1028
00:30:28.090 --> 00:30:31.930
<v Speaker 9>We were all told that he was half alien ass man.</v>

1029
00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:36.130
<v Speaker 9>He was here to save the world and he was higher than a CIA.</v>

1030
00:30:36.550 --> 00:30:38.110
<v Speaker 9>Special labs for the government.</v>

1031
00:30:40.890 --> 00:30:43.120
<v Speaker 1>What detectives are now working on the downturn?</v>

1032
00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:48.500
<v Speaker 1>This is actually on the news and checking to see if anyone else has said at</v>

1033
00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:51.120
<v Speaker 1>least sketch Pacific.</v>

1034
00:30:51.210 --> 00:30:52.410
<v Speaker 1>Now you don't have any pictures,</v>

1035
00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:53.341
<v Speaker 1>no pictures,</v>

1036
00:30:53.341 --> 00:30:54.031
<v Speaker 1>no photos,</v>

1037
00:30:54.031 --> 00:30:55.080
<v Speaker 1>but at least get a drawing.</v>

1038
00:30:55.110 --> 00:30:58.890
<v Speaker 1>There's one drawing that looks a lot like will Smith for men and black too.</v>

1039
00:31:00.810 --> 00:31:05.070
<v Speaker 1>It's so stupid that all you have to do is have some guns and some cash and a</v>

1040
00:31:05.071 --> 00:31:06.960
<v Speaker 1>stupid story and you'll make the news.</v>

1041
00:31:07.230 --> 00:31:08.880
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's really what this is about.</v>

1042
00:31:08.910 --> 00:31:12.060
<v Speaker 1>This is really about guns and k oddly no contest.</v>

1043
00:31:12.090 --> 00:31:14.250
<v Speaker 1>All we know is he was involved.</v>

1044
00:31:14.290 --> 00:31:14.430
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1045
00:31:14.430 --> 00:31:15.120
<v Speaker 1>you don't know anything.</v>

1046
00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:15.661
<v Speaker 1>This is what you know.</v>

1047
00:31:15.661 --> 00:31:18.180
<v Speaker 1>You got guns and you've got cash and you've got a dead dude.</v>

1048
00:31:18.420 --> 00:31:19.380
<v Speaker 1>And because of that,</v>

1049
00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:20.370
<v Speaker 1>everybody is getting crazy.</v>

1050
00:31:20.371 --> 00:31:21.600
<v Speaker 1>That half alien dude,</v>

1051
00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:23.580
<v Speaker 1>like if you only have like five guns,</v>

1052
00:31:23.670 --> 00:31:24.181
<v Speaker 1>who would be like,</v>

1053
00:31:24.181 --> 00:31:27.150
<v Speaker 1>well he was a gun enthusiast and if you had 20 guns,</v>

1054
00:31:27.151 --> 00:31:27.631
<v Speaker 1>people were like,</v>

1055
00:31:27.631 --> 00:31:30.960
<v Speaker 1>well what was he planning when you have 1,200 guns,</v>

1056
00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:31.950
<v Speaker 1>then you're on TV.</v>

1057
00:31:32.010 --> 00:31:32.970
<v Speaker 1>You didn't make the news.</v>

1058
00:31:33.060 --> 00:31:36.750
<v Speaker 1>And what's weird is that most gun collectors don't usually have ammo for all the</v>

1059
00:31:36.751 --> 00:31:38.760
<v Speaker 1>weapons because they never plan on firing.</v>

1060
00:31:38.761 --> 00:31:41.160
<v Speaker 1>And they are these guns and he had ammo for all this.</v>

1061
00:31:41.430 --> 00:31:42.850
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he was a,</v>

1062
00:31:43.350 --> 00:31:43.471
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1063
00:31:43.471 --> 00:31:45.480
<v Speaker 1>he's suffering from late stage cancer.</v>

1064
00:31:46.830 --> 00:31:48.240
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's um,</v>

1065
00:31:48.550 --> 00:31:50.910
<v Speaker 1>he's a collector as far as he's,</v>

1066
00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:52.620
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's got all those guns,</v>

1067
00:31:52.621 --> 00:31:56.370
<v Speaker 1>but it's not like he's got them in cases like this is Christopher Columbus.</v>

1068
00:31:56.371 --> 00:32:00.210
<v Speaker 1>He must get anybody with a last name lash.</v>

1069
00:32:00.930 --> 00:32:02.680
<v Speaker 1>I know it sounds like the terminator movie,</v>

1070
00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:05.160
<v Speaker 1>her real name and her name was bunker in that picture.</v>

1071
00:32:05.161 --> 00:32:05.581
<v Speaker 1>Like what,</v>

1072
00:32:05.581 --> 00:32:06.060
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

1073
00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:07.440
<v Speaker 1>Scroll back up to that picture Jamie.</v>

1074
00:32:07.650 --> 00:32:09.210
<v Speaker 1>What does it no down?</v>

1075
00:32:09.570 --> 00:32:10.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1076
00:32:10.140 --> 00:32:11.430
<v Speaker 1>Lash on thousand fires.</v>

1077
00:32:11.431 --> 00:32:14.790
<v Speaker 1>14 specially equipped cars among other strange,</v>

1078
00:32:14.791 --> 00:32:15.624
<v Speaker 1>unusual items.</v>

1079
00:32:15.810 --> 00:32:19.440
<v Speaker 1>So what does that is like work bench in there and look at all the piles of cash.</v>

1080
00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:23.460
<v Speaker 1>I mean in all they're saying all the cars were specially equipped,</v>

1081
00:32:23.490 --> 00:32:23.761
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1082
00:32:23.761 --> 00:32:24.750
<v Speaker 1>like with weird things.</v>

1083
00:32:24.780 --> 00:32:25.613
<v Speaker 1>So He's a nut.</v>

1084
00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:27.240
<v Speaker 1>He's probably one of those preppers.</v>

1085
00:32:27.810 --> 00:32:31.710
<v Speaker 1>It's just amazing that this can actually become a story just because you have to</v>

1086
00:32:31.711 --> 00:32:33.000
<v Speaker 1>catch a movie out of it.</v>

1087
00:32:33.270 --> 00:32:34.103
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1088
00:32:34.170 --> 00:32:34.720
<v Speaker 1>Are there any,</v>

1089
00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:36.030

<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1092
00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:38.520
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1093
00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:39.380
<v Speaker 1>Christian Bale.</v>

1094
00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:42.133
<v Speaker 2>He's gonna play him.</v>

1095
00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:44.000
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be like an ironic comedy.</v>

1096
00:32:44.090 --> 00:32:44.331
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1097

1101
00:32:48.590 --> 00:32:49.950
<v Speaker 2>He's going to play it like that though.</v>

1102
00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:51.260
<v Speaker 2>I'll be bloated,</v>

1122
00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:21.320
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what you're talking about.</v>

1123
00:33:21.321 --> 00:33:22.760
<v Speaker 2>Stone Aloha movie.</v>

1124
00:33:23.390 --> 00:33:24.260
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's it.</v>

1125
00:33:24.290 --> 00:33:24.831
<v Speaker 2>It was a,</v>

1126
00:33:24.831 --> 00:33:26.360
<v Speaker 2>it was a movie about,</v>

1127

<v Speaker 2>I don't even know what it was about.</v>

1128
00:33:28.041 --> 00:33:29.210
<v Speaker 2>It's just a ridiculous movie.</v>

1129
00:33:29.211 --> 00:33:30.920
<v Speaker 2>I think it was a private investigator or something.</v>

1130
00:33:30.950 --> 00:33:31.850
<v Speaker 2>Halfway in the movie.</v>

1131
00:33:31.851 --> 00:33:32.511
<v Speaker 2>I shut it off.</v>

1132
00:33:32.511 --> 00:33:32.751
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>

1133
00:33:32.751 --> 00:33:33.650

1134
00:33:33.710 --> 00:33:34.401
<v Speaker 2>I never do that.</v>

1135
00:33:34.401 --> 00:33:36.320
<v Speaker 2>I almost always watch a movie all the way to the end.</v>

1136
00:33:37.730 --> 00:33:39.590
<v Speaker 2>That's how I had a movie theater.</v>

1141
00:33:48.350 --> 00:33:49.760
<v Speaker 2>That movie was horrible.</v>

1142
00:33:50.020 --> 00:33:50.420
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

00:33:50.420 --> 00:33:51.980
<v Speaker 2>Kevin Hart and Will Ferrell,</v>

1144
00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:53.053
<v Speaker 2>Kevin Hart,</v>

1145
00:33:53.810 --> 00:33:55.580
<v Speaker 2>Kevin Hart kills it as a comedian.</v>

1146
00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:56.630
<v Speaker 2>Just kills it.</v>

1147
00:33:56.631 --> 00:33:57.830
<v Speaker 2>He's killing it on the road.</v>

1148
00:33:57.831 --> 00:33:59.240
<v Speaker 2>He's on the cover of rolling stone now.</v>

1149
00:33:59.241 --> 00:34:01.790
<v Speaker 2>I think put a lot of people don't like his movies.</v>

1150
00:34:02.210 --> 00:34:03.290
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what that's about it.</v>

1151
00:34:03.490 --> 00:34:04.640
<v Speaker 2>He's just not good then.</v>

1152
00:34:04.690 --> 00:34:05.590
<v Speaker 2>It's not good as you.</v>

1153
00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:07.280
<v Speaker 2>Do you think he's doing too many movies?</v>

1154
00:34:07.310 --> 00:34:09.020
<v Speaker 2>Does he just just jam them in there?</v>

1155
00:34:09.021 --> 00:34:11.510
<v Speaker 2>Like whatever they come with money that they think is going to sell?</v>

1156
00:34:11.540 --> 00:34:12.980
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I've ever seen a Kevin Hart movie.</v>

1157
00:34:13.010 --> 00:34:13.970
<v Speaker 2>Second only have that one.</v>

1158
00:34:13.971 --> 00:34:14.804
<v Speaker 2>The judge,</v>

1159
00:34:15.430 --> 00:34:16.940
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't turn down his volume.</v>

1160
00:34:16.970 --> 00:34:17.450
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1161
00:34:17.450 --> 00:34:19.100
<v Speaker 2>he's always on like level 10.</v>

1162
00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:20.150
<v Speaker 2>That's what it bothers you.</v>

1163
00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:21.313
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1164
00:34:21.470 --> 00:34:23.240
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I've seen the Kevin Hart movie,</v>

1165
00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:27.230
<v Speaker 2>but I'm just assuming that he's always that way.</v>

1166
00:34:28.370 --> 00:34:30.710
<v Speaker 2>High Energy Inherent Vice.</v>

1167
00:34:30.830 --> 00:34:31.620
<v Speaker 2>That's the name of the willing,</v>

1168
00:34:31.620 --> 00:34:33.260
<v Speaker 2>that poster a lot of people told me.</v>

1169
00:34:33.261 --> 00:34:34.070
<v Speaker 2>It was amazing.</v>

1170
00:34:34.070 --> 00:34:35.360
<v Speaker 2>Like this is such a cool movie.</v>

1171
00:34:35.361 --> 00:34:37.100
<v Speaker 2>And I was halfway into it.</v>

1172
00:34:37.101 --> 00:34:37.401
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1173
00:34:37.401 --> 00:34:38.600
<v Speaker 2>you gotta be fucking kidding me.</v>

1174
00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:40.070
<v Speaker 2>What are you doing to me?</v>

1175
00:34:40.190 --> 00:34:42.270
<v Speaker 2>You fucks good.</v>

1176
00:34:42.310 --> 00:34:43.143
<v Speaker 2>Pallister though.</v>

1177
00:34:43.210 --> 00:34:43.420
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1178
00:34:43.420 --> 00:34:43.610
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1179
00:34:43.610 --> 00:34:45.830
<v Speaker 2>it's stylistically a very cool movie.</v>

1180
00:34:46.220 --> 00:34:47.053
<v Speaker 2>And I loved that</v>

1181
00:34:48.680 --> 00:34:49.640
<v Speaker 2>they can do that.</v>

1182
00:34:49.970 --> 00:34:54.170
<v Speaker 2>All the residuals from this movie should go to the graphic designer for this</v>

1183
00:34:54.171 --> 00:34:54.561
<v Speaker 2>poster.</v>

1184
00:34:54.561 --> 00:34:57.320
<v Speaker 2>And then the people put together the traders or the producers,</v>

1185
00:34:57.370 --> 00:34:58.203
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1186
00:34:58.610 --> 00:35:00.110
<v Speaker 2>But it never goes that way.</v>

1187
00:35:00.340 --> 00:35:00.490
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1188
00:35:00.490 --> 00:35:02.420
<v Speaker 2>it's got this 1960s vibe to it,</v>

1189
00:35:02.421 --> 00:35:03.610
<v Speaker 2>or 1970s vibe too.</v>

1190
00:35:03.630 --> 00:35:04.960
<v Speaker 2>It's just a very strange movie.</v>

1191
00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:06.793
<v Speaker 2>Just didn't,</v>

1192
00:35:06.860 --> 00:35:07.820
<v Speaker 2>didn't get into it.</v>

1193
00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:08.961
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1194
00:35:08.961 --> 00:35:09.141
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1195
00:35:09.141 --> 00:35:10.040
<v Speaker 2>you're on girl code,</v>

1196
00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:12.470
<v Speaker 2>an girl code.</v>

1197
00:35:12.770 --> 00:35:13.603
<v Speaker 2>What do you do for that?</v>

1198
00:35:13.940 --> 00:35:15.140
<v Speaker 2>What does that involve?</v>

1199
00:35:15.380 --> 00:35:16.580
<v Speaker 2>Being a talking head.</v>

1200
00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:19.820
<v Speaker 2>So it's like one of those things where things play in the news and you start,</v>

1201
00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:20.713
<v Speaker 2>you comment on it.</v>

1202
00:35:21.790 --> 00:35:22.611
<v Speaker 2>They don't do the news,</v>

1203
00:35:22.611 --> 00:35:23.810
<v Speaker 2>they just give you topics</v>

1204
00:35:25.450 --> 00:35:25.861
<v Speaker 2>and Hoff.</v>

1205
00:35:25.861 --> 00:35:26.694
<v Speaker 2>Did he do that?</v>

1206
00:35:27.340 --> 00:35:30.830
<v Speaker 2>Well I did it like once a month when I did it.</v>

1207
00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:32.133
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1208
00:35:32.650 --> 00:35:32.990
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

1209
00:35:32.990 --> 00:35:33.890
<v Speaker 2>I'm not doing anymore.</v>

1210
00:35:34.700 --> 00:35:35.533
<v Speaker 2>Stopped</v>

1211
00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:38.340
<v Speaker 2>was like I've had enough.</v>

1212
00:35:39.450 --> 00:35:42.990
<v Speaker 2>I've had enough of you guys dressing me up like I'm a 14 year old girl.</v>

1213
00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:43.993
<v Speaker 2>So they did.</v>

1214
00:35:44.250 --> 00:35:45.083
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1215
00:35:45.430 --> 00:35:47.310
<v Speaker 2>Like I would have like bows in my hair.</v>

1216
00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:49.513
<v Speaker 2>What is that?</v>

1217
00:35:49.650 --> 00:35:50.371
<v Speaker 2>That's racist,</v>

1218
00:35:50.371 --> 00:35:50.910
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1219
00:35:50.910 --> 00:35:53.490
<v Speaker 2>Well they would like make all of us look like that.</v>

1220
00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:55.570
<v Speaker 2>All the girls on the scene,</v>

1221
00:35:55.620 --> 00:35:57.600
<v Speaker 2>I mean not like all of them,</v>

1222
00:35:57.601 --> 00:35:59.340
<v Speaker 2>but maybe some of them</v>

1223
00:36:02.030 --> 00:36:03.420
<v Speaker 2>know how many black girls.</v>

1224
00:36:03.421 --> 00:36:04.830
<v Speaker 2>No diversity on girl code.</v>

1225
00:36:05.420 --> 00:36:06.540
<v Speaker 2>Like behind the scenes,</v>

1226
00:36:06.830 --> 00:36:07.640
<v Speaker 2>but talent.</v>

1227
00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:08.280
<v Speaker 2>The talent.</v>

1228
00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:08.551
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1229
00:36:08.551 --> 00:36:08.960
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1230
00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:09.960
<v Speaker 2>Did they make the talent?</v>

1231
00:36:09.990 --> 00:36:10.823
<v Speaker 2>The black girls?</v>

1232
00:36:11.810 --> 00:36:12.643
<v Speaker 2>They're 12</v>

1233
00:36:15.220 --> 00:36:16.053
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1234
00:36:16.070 --> 00:36:16.903
<v Speaker 2>You don't know?</v>

1235
00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:19.270
<v Speaker 2>You should know.</v>

1236
00:36:21.870 --> 00:36:22.703
<v Speaker 2>You ask him.</v>

1237
00:36:30.970 --> 00:36:31.950
<v Speaker 2>Taught me how to</v>

1238
00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:35.930
<v Speaker 2>go off on the spot.</v>

1239
00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:39.433
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1240
00:36:44.570 --> 00:36:45.403
<v Speaker 2>Kanye West,</v>

1241
00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:05.560
<v Speaker 2>her damps per day.</v>

1242
00:37:10.900 --> 00:37:12.660
<v Speaker 2>How many times a day does she get damped?</v>

1243
00:37:12.661 --> 00:37:13.494
<v Speaker 2>If she were to check,</v>

1244
00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:20.520
<v Speaker 2>everybody listening would want to know what you're talking about,</v>

1245
00:37:44.820 --> 00:37:47.860
<v Speaker 2>but it seems like those shows,</v>

1246
00:37:50.870 --> 00:37:53.690
<v Speaker 2>that's like pretty much</v>

1247
00:37:58.650 --> 00:37:59.483
<v Speaker 2>credit.</v>

1248
00:38:00.090 --> 00:38:01.080
<v Speaker 2>You don't get a writer's credit,</v>

1249
00:38:01.310 --> 00:38:03.590
<v Speaker 2>don't get paid very much.</v>

1250
00:38:05.370 --> 00:38:06.660
<v Speaker 2>It's a wild life show,</v>

1251
00:38:06.661 --> 00:38:08.240
<v Speaker 2>and occasionally Esther come on</v>

1252
00:38:11.390 --> 00:38:12.540
<v Speaker 2>people's opinions on stuff.</v>

1253
00:38:15.060 --> 00:38:16.300
<v Speaker 2>They have those VH one shows.</v>

1254
00:38:20.070 --> 00:38:25.070
<v Speaker 2>Basically they show clips splice in between people talking about like cherry pie</v>

1255
00:38:26.341 --> 00:38:27.240
<v Speaker 2>or something like that,</v>

1256
00:38:27.241 --> 00:38:29.250
<v Speaker 2>and that's really what the whole show is,</v>

1257
00:38:29.690 --> 00:38:30.840
<v Speaker 2>but yet the people that do it,</v>

1258
00:38:30.841 --> 00:38:31.920
<v Speaker 2>they don't get paid that much.</v>

1259
00:38:32.340 --> 00:38:33.690
<v Speaker 2>It's one of those little sneaky things.</v>

1260
00:38:33.691 --> 00:38:36.100
<v Speaker 2>They just figure they get you and</v>

1261
00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:38.260
<v Speaker 6>then somebody makes a lot of money.</v>

1262
00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:39.220
<v Speaker 6>Like Byron Allen,</v>

1263
00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:43.510
<v Speaker 6>Byron Allen Comics unleashed with Byron Allen.</v>

1264
00:38:43.690 --> 00:38:47.620
<v Speaker 6>The whole show is Byron Allen talking to Comedians and they,</v>

1265
00:38:47.980 --> 00:38:48.730
<v Speaker 6>hey Esther,</v>

1266
00:38:48.730 --> 00:38:51.500
<v Speaker 6>I understand you like zoos and you'll just start talking about the zoom.</v>

1267
00:38:51.540 --> 00:38:51.800
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>

1268
00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:54.160
<v Speaker 6>Can you make it sound like he's not forcing it so much?</v>

1269
00:38:54.360 --> 00:38:55.121
<v Speaker 6>It's all forest.</v>

1270
00:38:55.121 --> 00:38:56.680
<v Speaker 6>It's all forest and no one gives a fuck.</v>

1271
00:38:56.980 --> 00:38:58.450
<v Speaker 6>But that's the whole show.</v>

1272
00:38:58.510 --> 00:38:59.920
<v Speaker 6>And but he sells that show.</v>

1273
00:38:59.950 --> 00:39:03.250
<v Speaker 6>Byron Allen grew up around show business like what?</v>

1274
00:39:03.251 --> 00:39:06.040
<v Speaker 6>His mom worked for David Letterman or no,</v>

1275
00:39:06.041 --> 00:39:06.580
<v Speaker 6>not David.</v>

1276
00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:07.413
<v Speaker 6>Johnny Carson.</v>

1277
00:39:07.510 --> 00:39:07.990
<v Speaker 6>Oh Wow.</v>

1278
00:39:07.990 --> 00:39:09.260
<v Speaker 6>So his mom would clean,</v>

1279
00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:10.930
<v Speaker 6>would clean her,</v>

1280
00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:15.100
<v Speaker 6>his office and he would see the whole taping and he'd be a little kid standing</v>

1281
00:39:15.101 --> 00:39:17.650
<v Speaker 6>there like six years old watching Johnny Carson,</v>

1282
00:39:17.651 --> 00:39:20.590
<v Speaker 6>like say how to do it in the parking lot and then go on stage and make the magic</v>

1283
00:39:20.591 --> 00:39:21.160
<v Speaker 6>happen.</v>

1284
00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:22.240
<v Speaker 6>That's probably why he does it.</v>

1285
00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:23.350
<v Speaker 6>Like old school like that.</v>

1286
00:39:23.351 --> 00:39:23.510
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1287
00:39:23.510 --> 00:39:23.870
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1288
00:39:23.870 --> 00:39:24.670
<v Speaker 6>it does it.</v>

1289
00:39:24.670 --> 00:39:25.300
<v Speaker 6>That's,</v>

1290
00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:27.070
<v Speaker 6>that's who he watched every day.</v>

1291
00:39:27.340 --> 00:39:29.290
<v Speaker 6>Don't you think when you watch a talk show today,</v>

1292
00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:30.430
<v Speaker 6>like if you watch like,</v>

1293
00:39:30.431 --> 00:39:31.264
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

1294
00:39:31.420 --> 00:39:31.841
<v Speaker 6>anyone,</v>

1295
00:39:31.841 --> 00:39:32.770
<v Speaker 6>Fallon or any,</v>

1296
00:39:32.771 --> 00:39:34.390
<v Speaker 6>any of these new talk shows?</v>

1297
00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:35.680
<v Speaker 6>There is,</v>

1298
00:39:35.681 --> 00:39:39.490
<v Speaker 6>it seems so weird to me that no one can move away from the desk.</v>

1299
00:39:39.900 --> 00:39:40.270
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1300
00:39:40.270 --> 00:39:43.810
<v Speaker 6>You have to have a fucking desk and pretend like you're working in an office and</v>

1301
00:39:43.811 --> 00:39:47.680
<v Speaker 6>right next to you in most awkward way possible has to be someone sitting in a</v>

1302
00:39:47.681 --> 00:39:49.050
<v Speaker 6>chair next to the desk.</v>

1303
00:39:49.570 --> 00:39:51.790
<v Speaker 6>Why is it made to look like an office?</v>

1304
00:39:51.850 --> 00:39:53.110
<v Speaker 6>It's so strange.</v>

1305
00:39:53.140 --> 00:39:54.010
<v Speaker 6>Wouldn't be couches,</v>

1306
00:39:54.011 --> 00:39:55.230
<v Speaker 6>be better bed.</v>

1307
00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:58.540
<v Speaker 6>It's kind of like a doctor's office or something,</v>

1308
00:39:58.541 --> 00:40:00.250
<v Speaker 6>like you're sitting next to a receptionist.</v>

1309
00:40:00.251 --> 00:40:01.660
<v Speaker 6>It's like you don't even face them.</v>

1310
00:40:01.870 --> 00:40:03.970
<v Speaker 6>It's the weirdest way to have a conversation.</v>

1311
00:40:04.270 --> 00:40:04.781
<v Speaker 6>It's like if we,</v>

1312
00:40:04.781 --> 00:40:05.614
<v Speaker 6>we were,</v>

1313
00:40:05.630 --> 00:40:09.490
<v Speaker 6>the cameras were here where Jamie is and you and I will be talking like this.</v>

1314
00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:09.850
<v Speaker 6>That's,</v>

1315
00:40:09.850 --> 00:40:11.620
<v Speaker 6>that's literally how it would be doing the show.</v>

1316
00:40:11.650 --> 00:40:12.730
<v Speaker 6>We'll be right back.</v>

1317
00:40:13.690 --> 00:40:14.170
<v Speaker 6>And you,</v>

1318
00:40:14.170 --> 00:40:16.500
<v Speaker 6>the camera's facing you and you'd go sideways.</v>

1319
00:40:16.510 --> 00:40:20.320
<v Speaker 6>The first talk show host who had a desk set up on his stage,</v>

1320
00:40:20.910 --> 00:40:23.740
<v Speaker 6>probably par Jack Parr who was before.</v>

1321
00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:24.551
<v Speaker 6>Is that who it was?</v>

1322
00:40:24.551 --> 00:40:29.110
<v Speaker 6>That was maybe Jack Harlan didn't like wearing pants and he just wanted to cover</v>

1323
00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:30.580
<v Speaker 6>his lower body.</v>

1324
00:40:30.670 --> 00:40:33.430
<v Speaker 6>Who Do you think was the original talk show host on TV?</v>

1325
00:40:33.540 --> 00:40:34.570
<v Speaker 6>What do you want to say?</v>

1326
00:40:36.130 --> 00:40:37.720
<v Speaker 6>What was the original television talk show?</v>

1327
00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:39.160
<v Speaker 6>I have no idea.</v>

1328
00:40:40.090 --> 00:40:40.960
<v Speaker 6>I'll go with Jack Paar.</v>

1329
00:40:40.961 --> 00:40:41.740
<v Speaker 6>That sounds good.</v>

1330
00:40:41.740 --> 00:40:42.041
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1331
00:40:42.041 --> 00:40:43.390
<v Speaker 6>I don't even know if that's his real name.</v>

1332
00:40:43.630 --> 00:40:44.463
<v Speaker 10>Okay.</v>

1333
00:40:45.380 --> 00:40:45.980
<v Speaker 6>Wait,</v>

1334
00:40:45.980 --> 00:40:49.090
<v Speaker 6>you talked showing Steve Allen was a big one for a while.</v>

1335
00:40:50.020 --> 00:40:52.300
<v Speaker 6>Late night talk show Wikipedia,</v>

1336
00:40:52.350 --> 00:40:52.660
<v Speaker 6>Dat,</v>

1337
00:40:52.660 --> 00:40:53.001

00:40:54.300 --> 00:40:55.180
<v Speaker 6>dat to that on that.</v>

1341
00:40:55.190 --> 00:40:55.780
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

1342
00:40:55.780 --> 00:40:56.081
<v Speaker 6>all right.</v>

1343
00:40:56.081 --> 00:40:56.920
<v Speaker 6>Let's go with history.</v>

1344
00:40:56.921 --> 00:40:58.810
<v Speaker 6>United States forties and Whoa.</v>

1345
00:40:58.860 --> 00:40:59.860
<v Speaker 6>Forties okay,</v>

1346
00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:02.560
<v Speaker 6>so they had radio ones,</v>

1347
00:41:02.590 --> 00:41:05.050
<v Speaker 6>so they had these old time radio shows.</v>

1348
00:41:05.490 --> 00:41:06.323
<v Speaker 10>That's cool.</v>

1349
00:41:06.780 --> 00:41:11.300
<v Speaker 6>So they didn't have the two chairs and since Sullivan show,</v>

1350
00:41:11.810 --> 00:41:13.950
<v Speaker 6>Ed Sullivan might've been one of the first ones,</v>

1351
00:41:13.951 --> 00:41:14.784
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>

1352
00:41:14.790 --> 00:41:15.623
<v Speaker 6>That aired on,</v>

1353
00:41:15.660 --> 00:41:16.320
<v Speaker 6>whoa.</v>

1354
00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:17.153
<v Speaker 6>Jesus Christ.</v>

1355
00:41:17.430 --> 00:41:18.570
<v Speaker 6>Ed Sullivan,</v>

1356
00:41:19.020 --> 00:41:20.850
<v Speaker 6>originally known as toast of the town,</v>

1357
00:41:20.851 --> 00:41:25.851
<v Speaker 6>which aired on CBS Sunday nights from 1948 to 1971 holy shit.</v>

1358
00:41:27.301 --> 00:41:29.640
<v Speaker 6>Did you know I have no idea.</v>

1359
00:41:29.670 --> 00:41:31.170
<v Speaker 6>Jesus Christ,</v>

1360
00:41:32.070 --> 00:41:33.380
<v Speaker 6>23 years.</v>

1361
00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:34.400
<v Speaker 6>That's insane.</v>

1362
00:41:34.670 --> 00:41:35.460
<v Speaker 6>33 well,</v>

1363
00:41:35.460 --> 00:41:36.051
<v Speaker 6>that's insane.</v>

1364
00:41:36.051 --> 00:41:37.040
<v Speaker 6>23 years.</v>

1365
00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:38.671
<v Speaker 6>Wait,</v>

1366
00:41:38.671 --> 00:41:41.820
<v Speaker 6>48 to two doing the math</v>

1367
00:41:44.150 --> 00:41:45.180
<v Speaker 6>to 70 what?</v>

1368
00:41:45.690 --> 00:41:48.300
<v Speaker 6>(712) 037-0120 three years.</v>

1369
00:41:48.830 --> 00:41:49.280
<v Speaker 6>Melvin barrel.</v>

1370
00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:49.590
<v Speaker 6>Also,</v>

1371
00:41:49.590 --> 00:41:51.510
<v Speaker 6>I was at a show and 23 Michael Jordan,</v>

1372
00:41:51.930 --> 00:41:54.600
<v Speaker 6>Milton Berle had one in 48 on NBC.</v>

1373
00:41:55.110 --> 00:41:58.890
<v Speaker 6>The shows aired once a week in the evening time slots that would come to known</v>

1374
00:41:58.891 --> 00:42:00.330
<v Speaker 6>as prime time.</v>

1375
00:42:00.420 --> 00:42:05.420
<v Speaker 6>The first show to air on late night was Broadway Open House and aired on NBC in</v>

1376
00:42:05.581 --> 00:42:07.560
<v Speaker 6>1950 it was canceled a year later.</v>

1377
00:42:07.561 --> 00:42:11.010
<v Speaker 6>Not enough people own television says to make a late night television series</v>

1378
00:42:11.011 --> 00:42:11.844
<v Speaker 6>worthwhile.</v>

1379
00:42:12.090 --> 00:42:13.080
<v Speaker 6>Whoa.</v>

1380
00:42:13.260 --> 00:42:16.080
<v Speaker 6>The first version of the tonight show starring Steve Allen.</v>

1381
00:42:16.081 --> 00:42:19.800
<v Speaker 6>So he was the first 1954 on NBC.</v>

1382
00:42:19.801 --> 00:42:21.570
<v Speaker 6>I wonder if that was 11 o'clock at night too.</v>

1383
00:42:22.750 --> 00:42:23.560
<v Speaker 6>Hmm.</v>

1384
00:42:23.560 --> 00:42:26.580
<v Speaker 6>The show created many modern talk show staples earlier.</v>

1385
00:42:28.610 --> 00:42:28.971
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1386
00:42:28.971 --> 00:42:31.160
<v Speaker 6>Maybe I went to bed earlier back in the day.</v>

1387
00:42:31.540 --> 00:42:31.821
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1388
00:42:31.821 --> 00:42:32.370
<v Speaker 6>I'm probably,</v>

1389
00:42:32.370 --> 00:42:33.680
<v Speaker 6>did they go to sleep later?</v>

1390
00:42:34.470 --> 00:42:36.530
<v Speaker 6>I thought would think there had been went to bed earlier earlier.</v>

1391
00:42:37.370 --> 00:42:39.280
<v Speaker 6>They wouldn't have started electricity,</v>

1392
00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:45.000
<v Speaker 6>electricity to watching TV on by candle light farmers and never have to go to</v>

1393
00:42:45.411 --> 00:42:45.711
<v Speaker 6>bed.</v>

1394
00:42:45.711 --> 00:42:46.461
<v Speaker 6>When it got dark.</v>

1395
00:42:46.461 --> 00:42:47.870
<v Speaker 6>They weren't streetlights yet.</v>

1396
00:42:48.260 --> 00:42:50.600
<v Speaker 6>So this says that Steve Allen created at all.</v>

1397
00:42:50.601 --> 00:42:51.021
<v Speaker 6>It says,</v>

1398
00:42:51.021 --> 00:42:53.450
<v Speaker 6>the show created many monitored talk show staples,</v>

1399
00:42:53.451 --> 00:42:55.130
<v Speaker 6>including the opening monologue,</v>

1400
00:42:55.280 --> 00:42:56.540
<v Speaker 6>celebrity interviews,</v>

1401
00:42:56.630 --> 00:42:57.920
<v Speaker 6>audience participation,</v>

1402
00:42:57.921 --> 00:42:59.990
<v Speaker 6>comedy bits and musical performances.</v>

1403
00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:00.981
<v Speaker 6>By this point,</v>

1404
00:43:00.981 --> 00:43:05.030
<v Speaker 6>the federal communications commission had lifted a freeze on new television</v>

1405
00:43:05.031 --> 00:43:05.780
<v Speaker 6>stations,</v>

1406
00:43:05.780 --> 00:43:10.040
<v Speaker 6>which allowed new stations to pop up across the country and television adoption</v>

1407
00:43:10.041 --> 00:43:12.170
<v Speaker 6>soon grew exponentially as a result,</v>

1408
00:43:12.350 --> 00:43:14.120
<v Speaker 6>unlike broadly open house,</v>

1409
00:43:14.330 --> 00:43:16.820
<v Speaker 6>the tonight show proved to be a resoundingly success,</v>

1410
00:43:16.970 --> 00:43:17.803
<v Speaker 6>Huh?</v>

1411
00:43:18.440 --> 00:43:19.700
<v Speaker 6>What the fuck was that like?</v>

1412
00:43:19.730 --> 00:43:24.230
<v Speaker 6>Pull up a video on the tonight show with Steve Allen from like the earliest you</v>

1413
00:43:24.231 --> 00:43:25.064
<v Speaker 6>could find.</v>

1414
00:43:25.110 --> 00:43:27.380
<v Speaker 6>No wonder is Byron and got his job.</v>

1415
00:43:27.470 --> 00:43:29.330
<v Speaker 6>He's like in the family and island.</v>

1416
00:43:29.990 --> 00:43:30.410
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

1417
00:43:30.410 --> 00:43:34.580
<v Speaker 6>he also found one of those niches where you could kind of sell a show like that.</v>

1418
00:43:34.610 --> 00:43:36.650
<v Speaker 6>Like that's what I was kind of saying is that those shows,</v>

1419
00:43:36.651 --> 00:43:38.390
<v Speaker 6>it doesn't cost much to make them,</v>

1420
00:43:38.470 --> 00:43:40.220
<v Speaker 6>you don't pay the comedians much.</v>

1421
00:43:40.580 --> 00:43:42.620
<v Speaker 6>That's all stories written by other people.</v>

1422
00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:43.430
<v Speaker 6>Exactly.</v>

1423
00:43:43.430 --> 00:43:43.970
<v Speaker 6>They're like,</v>

1424
00:43:43.970 --> 00:43:45.200
<v Speaker 6>but I put it together,</v>

1425
00:43:45.410 --> 00:43:50.000
<v Speaker 6>I put it in a book and I'm going to make all the money and my names like I'm on</v>

1426
00:43:50.001 --> 00:43:50.834
<v Speaker 6>as an author.</v>

1427
00:43:50.870 --> 00:43:52.910
<v Speaker 6>I mean that kind of is the exact show.</v>

1428
00:43:52.940 --> 00:43:55.490
<v Speaker 6>The whole show is people doing their acts.</v>

1429
00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:56.570
<v Speaker 6>You know what I mean?</v>

1430
00:43:56.570 --> 00:43:57.270
<v Speaker 6>Literally it's,</v>

1431
00:43:57.270 --> 00:43:58.103
<v Speaker 6>you're doing,</v>

1432
00:43:58.770 --> 00:43:59.603
<v Speaker 6>it's total ripoff.</v>

1433
00:43:59.900 --> 00:44:00.733
<v Speaker 6>It's like if you were sick,</v>

1434
00:44:00.760 --> 00:44:03.950
<v Speaker 6>if you were singing songs that you wrote and then they sold the cds,</v>

1435
00:44:03.980 --> 00:44:04.401
<v Speaker 6>he be like,</v>

1436
00:44:04.401 --> 00:44:05.234
<v Speaker 6>what the fuck?</v>

1437
00:44:05.660 --> 00:44:06.590
<v Speaker 6>That's what they're doing.</v>

1438
00:44:06.591 --> 00:44:08.570
<v Speaker 6>I mean these people creating these bits,</v>

1439
00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:09.380
<v Speaker 6>they have them,</v>

1440
00:44:09.380 --> 00:44:10.011
<v Speaker 6>then they go,</v>

00:45:00.791 --> 00:45:03.130
<v Speaker 7>how did you happen to pick up your first bicycle?</v>

1479
00:45:03.940 --> 00:45:07.000
<v Speaker 7>I was discussing this before with some of the people backstage.</v>

1480
00:45:07.001 --> 00:45:10.600
<v Speaker 7>I believe that a lot of the people have actually played by cycles from time to</v>

1481
00:45:10.601 --> 00:45:11.530
<v Speaker 7>time by side.</v>

1482
00:45:11.680 --> 00:45:12.281
<v Speaker 7>They're young.</v>

1483
00:45:12.281 --> 00:45:16.990
<v Speaker 7>They take a piece of cardboard and a clothes pin and attach it to the rear wheel</v>

1484
00:45:16.991 --> 00:45:17.980
<v Speaker 7>and when it goes around,</v>

1485
00:45:17.981 --> 00:45:20.170
<v Speaker 7>it makes that noise and you're playing a biocycle then.</v>

1486
00:45:20.750 --> 00:45:20.920
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>

1487
00:45:20.920 --> 00:45:21.241
<v Speaker 7>I see.</v>

1488
00:45:21.241 --> 00:45:23.500
<v Speaker 7>You mean when they pretend they have a little motor and just make it sound like</v>

1489
00:45:23.501 --> 00:45:24.010
<v Speaker 7>a motorbike?</v>

1490
00:45:24.010 --> 00:45:24.161
<v Speaker 7>Yes,</v>

1491
00:45:24.161 --> 00:45:24.994
<v Speaker 7>we've all done that.</v>

1492
00:45:25.160 --> 00:45:25.541
<v Speaker 7>What was that?</v>

1493
00:45:25.541 --> 00:45:25.961
<v Speaker 7>What you'll do?</v>

1494
00:45:25.961 --> 00:45:27.190
<v Speaker 7>You'll make a motorbike noise.</v>

1495
00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:28.600
<v Speaker 7>I see a couple of bikes over here.</v>

1496
00:45:28.601 --> 00:45:30.730
<v Speaker 7>Perhaps you'd better go over and demonstrate and show them what you do.</v>

1497
00:45:30.980 --> 00:45:33.780
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck where people entertained by back then Pa.</v>

00:47:07.820 --> 00:47:11.820
<v Speaker 1>1963 when he was a buttoned up with a tie and a suit.</v>

1551
00:47:12.120 --> 00:47:15.330
<v Speaker 1>He was weird as fuck I got when I first started smoking weed,</v>

1552
00:47:15.331 --> 00:47:16.860
<v Speaker 1>that was the first music I would listen to.</v>

1553
00:47:16.861 --> 00:47:20.220
<v Speaker 1>Me and my friends would just sit in our car and smoke and listened to Zachary.</v>

1554
00:47:20.340 --> 00:47:22.470
<v Speaker 1>I listened to Zappa way before that.</v>

1555
00:47:22.620 --> 00:47:23.790
<v Speaker 1>Before I was smoking weed.</v>

1556
00:47:23.791 --> 00:47:25.650
<v Speaker 1>I listened to Zappa because I had a friend,</v>

1557
00:47:25.651 --> 00:47:27.780
<v Speaker 1>my friend Tommy when I lived,</v>

1558
00:47:28.260 --> 00:47:29.080
<v Speaker 1>Shit,</v>

1559
00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:30.820
<v Speaker 1>I think I lived in Florida.</v>

1560
00:47:31.660 --> 00:47:32.360
<v Speaker 1>My friend.</v>

1561
00:47:32.360 --> 00:47:32.561

1563
00:47:33.230 --> 00:47:33.671
<v Speaker 1>My friend,</v>

1564
00:47:33.671 --> 00:47:37.570
<v Speaker 1>Tommy's dad was a a real freak.</v>

1565
00:47:37.571 --> 00:47:40.390
<v Speaker 1>He was a weird dude and he had a sob.</v>

1566
00:47:40.410 --> 00:47:43.210
<v Speaker 1>I remember it was the first guy that I've ever met that had a Saab.</v>

1567
00:47:43.700 --> 00:47:46.090
<v Speaker 1>The Saa be one of those cars.</v>

1568
00:47:46.180 --> 00:47:47.380
<v Speaker 1>Those guys are freaks.</v>

1569
00:47:47.410 --> 00:47:47.591
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1570
00:47:47.591 --> 00:47:50.170
<v Speaker 1>back then it was weird like he had the key was on the ground,</v>

1571
00:47:50.200 --> 00:47:50.961
<v Speaker 1>like on the floor.</v>

1572
00:47:50.961 --> 00:47:51.161
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1573
00:47:51.161 --> 00:47:52.260
<v Speaker 1>what is this,</v>

1574
00:47:52.261 --> 00:47:52.700
<v Speaker 1>this car?</v>

1575
00:47:52.700 --> 00:47:54.890
<v Speaker 1>So it was a really old site</v>

1576
00:47:56.640 --> 00:47:58.720
<v Speaker 1>because it was the 1970s but a,</v>

1577
00:47:58.721 --> 00:48:01.750
<v Speaker 1>he was a fucking gigantic Zappa head.</v>

1578
00:48:01.751 --> 00:48:02.141
<v Speaker 1>This guy,</v>

1579
00:48:02.141 --> 00:48:04.510
<v Speaker 1>and he would play Zappa for me and for his son.</v>

1580
00:48:05.350 --> 00:48:07.060
<v Speaker 1>Interesting music because it's a,</v>

1581
00:48:07.061 --> 00:48:10.240
<v Speaker 1>it was really great to listen to with like headphones on because there were so</v>

1582
00:48:10.241 --> 00:48:12.430
<v Speaker 1>much noises and sounds going on.</v>

1583
00:48:12.700 --> 00:48:13.390
<v Speaker 1>So when,</v>

1584
00:48:13.390 --> 00:48:14.550
<v Speaker 1>when I was a young pothead,</v>

1585
00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:15.760
<v Speaker 1>that's all I would do is like,</v>

1586
00:48:15.850 --> 00:48:18.060
<v Speaker 1>it felt like trimming pot head,</v>

1587
00:48:18.380 --> 00:48:19.213
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1588
00:48:19.310 --> 00:48:19.570
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1589
00:48:19.570 --> 00:48:20.410
<v Speaker 1>he's not young anymore,</v>

1590
00:48:20.411 --> 00:48:21.440
<v Speaker 1>but he's definitely still a potter.</v>

1591
00:48:21.820 --> 00:48:22.211
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

1592
00:48:22.211 --> 00:48:22.691
<v Speaker 1>like those,</v>

1593
00:48:22.691 --> 00:48:23.230
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1594
00:48:23.230 --> 00:48:23.471
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1595
00:48:23.471 --> 00:48:23.680
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1596
00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:28.150
<v Speaker 1>if you listen to like a old Hendricks and you hear like different sounds going</v>

1597
00:48:28.151 --> 00:48:29.800
<v Speaker 1>back and forth across the,</v>

1598
00:48:30.140 --> 00:48:31.630
<v Speaker 1>like the field of sound,</v>

1599
00:48:31.631 --> 00:48:34.980
<v Speaker 1>like when you have the headphones on and go left and right and right and left as</v>

1600
00:48:34.981 --> 00:48:35.830
<v Speaker 1>the coolest shit.</v>

1601
00:48:35.980 --> 00:48:38.320
<v Speaker 1>That's what I graduated too after.</v>

1602
00:48:38.321 --> 00:48:38.800
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

1603
00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:39.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1604
00:48:39.290 --> 00:48:42.010
<v Speaker 1>That was like what they figured out how to do.</v>

1605
00:48:42.040 --> 00:48:44.050
<v Speaker 1>They didn't figure it out how to do that until like the sixties.</v>

1606
00:48:44.051 --> 00:48:44.884
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1607
00:48:45.010 --> 00:48:45.461
<v Speaker 1>Jamie,</v>

1608
00:48:45.461 --> 00:48:45.851
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1609
00:48:45.851 --> 00:48:49.390
<v Speaker 1>you're a sound engineer and stuff going back and forth and back and forth,</v>

1610
00:48:49.391 --> 00:48:50.290
<v Speaker 1>like the shit like,</v>

1611
00:48:50.291 --> 00:48:50.800
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1612
00:48:50.800 --> 00:48:51.970
<v Speaker 1>like the like,</v>

1613
00:48:51.971 --> 00:48:52.181
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1614
00:48:52.181 --> 00:48:56.890
<v Speaker 1>that long pause in whole lot of love where everything gets really weird.</v>

1615
00:48:56.920 --> 00:48:57.700
<v Speaker 1>Like they,</v>

1616
00:48:57.700 --> 00:49:01.420
<v Speaker 1>it sounds like a normal song and then it's just weird moaning and fuck noises</v>

1617
00:49:01.421 --> 00:49:04.210
<v Speaker 1>and strange symbols and stuff for like a minute and a half.</v>

1618
00:49:04.540 --> 00:49:05.190
<v Speaker 1>You know that.</v>

1619
00:49:05.190 --> 00:49:05.341
<v Speaker 13>Yeah.</v>

1620
00:49:05.341 --> 00:49:08.270
<v Speaker 13>There's a lot of stuff that was happening with Zeppelin because of they were</v>

1621
00:49:08.271 --> 00:49:10.770
<v Speaker 13>using magnetic tape and storage cause like,</v>

1622
00:49:10.830 --> 00:49:14.940
<v Speaker 13>oh get the wet that if the tape was wound too tightly it would get taped bleed</v>

1623
00:49:15.450 --> 00:49:16.740
<v Speaker 13>and uh,</v>

1624
00:49:16.860 --> 00:49:17.880
<v Speaker 13>five seconds before.</v>

1625
00:49:17.881 --> 00:49:20.480
<v Speaker 13>That's kind of how these weird reverb things and weird delays what happens.</v>

1626
00:49:20.481 --> 00:49:21.780
<v Speaker 13>So we're like sort of like that.</v>

1627
00:49:22.050 --> 00:49:22.980
<v Speaker 13>There'd be a weird screaming,</v>

1628
00:49:22.981 --> 00:49:26.640
<v Speaker 13>would it be a previous take on a vocal track because of the way it was stored?</v>

1629
00:49:26.940 --> 00:49:28.590
<v Speaker 13>It would end up 30 seconds later,</v>

1630
00:49:28.591 --> 00:49:31.770
<v Speaker 13>a minute later on another part of the song and it just sounded so cool.</v>

1631
00:49:31.771 --> 00:49:33.060
<v Speaker 13>They just kind of left that kind of stuff.</v>

1632
00:49:33.061 --> 00:49:33.894
<v Speaker 13>Then it's really,</v>

1633
00:49:33.930 --> 00:49:35.040
<v Speaker 13>instead of recording it over,</v>

1634
00:49:35.041 --> 00:49:36.000
<v Speaker 13>doing it all over again,</v>

1635
00:49:36.390 --> 00:49:38.160
<v Speaker 13>really accidents would just happen.</v>

1636
00:49:38.161 --> 00:49:38.560
<v Speaker 13>They'd leave it.</v>

1637
00:49:38.560 --> 00:49:39.393
<v Speaker 13>Man.</v>

1638
00:49:39.450 --> 00:49:40.650
<v Speaker 1>Dad's amazing.</v>

1639
00:49:40.651 --> 00:49:41.700
<v Speaker 1>I never heard that before.</v>

1640
00:49:41.701 --> 00:49:43.290
<v Speaker 1>So it's magnetic bleed,</v>

1641
00:49:43.650 --> 00:49:44.483
<v Speaker 1>tape bleed.</v>

1642
00:49:45.110 --> 00:49:45.943
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1643
00:49:46.130 --> 00:49:49.200
<v Speaker 1>As to learn some new shit every day.</v>

1644
00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:50.760
<v Speaker 1>Kind of like when a movie,</v>

1645
00:49:50.820 --> 00:49:53.790
<v Speaker 1>an old movie has all the fucked up films,</v>

1646
00:49:53.791 --> 00:49:57.210
<v Speaker 1>you know from Mike seriation and water damage and stuff like that.</v>

1647
00:49:57.240 --> 00:49:57.631
<v Speaker 1>Well when they,</v>

1648
00:49:57.631 --> 00:49:59.640
<v Speaker 1>whenever they want to show you like an educational film,</v>

1649
00:49:59.670 --> 00:50:00.780
<v Speaker 1>a pretend education,</v>

1650
00:50:00.810 --> 00:50:01.591
<v Speaker 1>like if it's a movie,</v>

1651
00:50:01.591 --> 00:50:05.160
<v Speaker 1>like a horror movie and they show like an educational film for the 1950s it</v>

1652
00:50:05.161 --> 00:50:09.600
<v Speaker 1>always has this like crackles and pops and this weird little artifacts and stuff</v>

1653
00:50:09.601 --> 00:50:10.530
<v Speaker 1>across the screen.</v>

1654
00:50:11.240 --> 00:50:12.290

<v Speaker 1>They're kind of cute.</v>

1660
00:50:21.460 --> 00:50:23.720
<v Speaker 1>Then the fact that people will like dumb kids back then.</v>

1661
00:50:24.090 --> 00:50:25.880
<v Speaker 1>It's weird that your parents are like dumb kids.</v>

1662
00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:27.560
<v Speaker 1>So simple that a or just like,</v>

00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:33.880
<v Speaker 2>You know like vintage advertisements for like Sears or Woolworths or an iron,</v>

1668
00:50:35.870 --> 00:50:40.870
<v Speaker 2>selling to the housewives in the 50s basic basic bitches.</v>

1669
00:50:41.090 --> 00:50:42.660
<v Speaker 2>People were just dumb or back then,</v>

1670
00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:43.461
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1671
00:50:43.461 --> 00:50:45.020
<v Speaker 2>women were just uneducated.</v>

1672
00:50:45.250 --> 00:50:47.360
<v Speaker 2>One was not an educated,</v>

1673
00:50:48.230 --> 00:50:52.610
<v Speaker 2>they knew how to do laundry and get grease out of aprons and shit.</v>

1674
00:50:52.900 --> 00:50:53.733
<v Speaker 2>Barely knew.</v>

1675
00:50:54.140 --> 00:50:54.510
<v Speaker 2>They don't know.</v>

1676
00:50:54.510 --> 00:50:57.020
<v Speaker 2>That had a vague apple pie.</v>

1677
00:50:58.290 --> 00:50:59.000
<v Speaker 2>Apple pies.</v>

1678
00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:00.050
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ asked her,</v>

1679
00:51:00.051 --> 00:51:01.310
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck are you talking about?</v>

1682
00:51:08.150 --> 00:51:09.200
<v Speaker 2>That's still common to cook.</v>

1683
00:51:10.190 --> 00:51:11.020
<v Speaker 2>I do cook.</v>

1684
00:51:11.020 --> 00:51:11.840
<v Speaker 2>What do you cook?</v>

1685
00:51:11.840 --> 00:51:12.673

1687
00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:17.361
<v Speaker 2>Curry.</v>

1688
00:51:17.361 --> 00:51:18.080
<v Speaker 2>Carrot soup.</v>

1689
00:51:18.080 --> 00:51:18.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1690
00:51:18.350 --> 00:51:20.450
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever made that super easy to do?</v>

1691
00:51:21.770 --> 00:51:22.281
<v Speaker 2>It is,</v>

1692
00:51:22.281 --> 00:51:22.730
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1693
00:51:22.730 --> 00:51:23.301
<v Speaker 2>You just,</v>

1694
00:51:23.301 --> 00:51:24.134
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1695
00:51:24.620 --> 00:51:29.620
<v Speaker 2>you just boil some carrots and some onions and garlic and then put it in the</v>

1696
00:51:29.781 --> 00:51:32.300
<v Speaker 2>food processor and you got soup.</v>

1697
00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:33.793
<v Speaker 2>That seems really,</v>

1698
00:51:34.150 --> 00:51:35.270
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't seem like cooking.</v>

1699
00:51:35.530 --> 00:51:37.580
<v Speaker 2>It's like you just smash them food together.</v>

1700
00:51:37.610 --> 00:51:38.270
<v Speaker 2>You're juicing,</v>

1701
00:51:38.270 --> 00:51:39.080
<v Speaker 2>you're juicing.</v>

1702
00:51:39.080 --> 00:51:39.650
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1703
00:51:39.650 --> 00:51:40.520
<v Speaker 2>that's cooking.</v>

1704
00:51:40.521 --> 00:51:41.354
<v Speaker 2>Cook.</v>

1705

00:51:43.250 --> 00:51:45.800
<v Speaker 2>I also cook lamb cook lamb,</v>

1707
00:51:46.280 --> 00:51:46.760
<v Speaker 2>lamb.</v>

1708
00:51:46.760 --> 00:51:48.100
<v Speaker 2>I like making um,</v>

1709
00:51:48.380 --> 00:51:49.850
<v Speaker 2>orange marmalade.</v>

1710
00:51:50.300 --> 00:51:51.230
<v Speaker 2>Glazed lamb.</v>

1711
00:51:51.460 --> 00:51:52.490
<v Speaker 2>Lamb is a weird one.</v>

1712
00:51:53.230 --> 00:51:53.540
<v Speaker 2>Lambs.</v>

1713
00:51:53.540 --> 00:51:53.991
<v Speaker 2>Weird one.</v>

1714
00:51:53.991 --> 00:51:55.190
<v Speaker 2>Because it's a baby.</v>

1715
00:51:56.450 --> 00:51:57.350
<v Speaker 2>Nobody thinks about that.</v>

1716
00:51:58.950 --> 00:52:01.280
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to stop making lamb baby.</v>

1717
00:52:03.110 --> 00:52:04.520
<v Speaker 2>You forget that it's a baby.</v>

1718
00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:06.080
<v Speaker 2>Nobody ever talks about it like that.</v>

1719
00:52:06.081 --> 00:52:07.190
<v Speaker 2>That's why we have a name for it,</v>

1720
00:52:07.440 --> 00:52:08.030
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1721
00:52:08.030 --> 00:52:08.151
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1722
00:52:08.151 --> 00:52:10.430
<v Speaker 2>you don't call a a cow cow.</v>

1723
00:52:10.640 --> 00:52:11.480
<v Speaker 2>They call it beef,</v>

1724
00:52:11.840 --> 00:52:12.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1725
00:52:12.320 --> 00:52:12.920
<v Speaker 2>chicken.</v>

1726
00:52:12.920 --> 00:52:14.250
<v Speaker 2>Nobody gives a fuck about chickens.</v>

1727
00:52:14.420 --> 00:52:15.380
<v Speaker 2>You can call it chicken.</v>

1728
00:52:15.690 --> 00:52:16.220
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1729
00:52:16.220 --> 00:52:16.731
<v Speaker 2>nobody has it.</v>

1730
00:52:16.731 --> 00:52:17.850
<v Speaker 2>Nobody feels bad for chicken.</v>

1731
00:52:17.851 --> 00:52:18.890
<v Speaker 2>So you can just call it a chicken.</v>

1732
00:52:19.250 --> 00:52:22.400
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to call it some exotic poultry name,</v>

1733
00:52:22.700 --> 00:52:23.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1734
00:52:23.330 --> 00:52:26.990
<v Speaker 2>but like lamb is the name that you have the tiny head chickens.</v>

1735
00:52:27.890 --> 00:52:28.191
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1736
00:52:28.191 --> 00:52:29.210
<v Speaker 2>The smaller the brain,</v>

1737
00:52:29.211 --> 00:52:30.170
<v Speaker 2>the smaller the brain,</v>

1738
00:52:30.171 --> 00:52:31.640
<v Speaker 2>the less we care about them I think.</v>

1739
00:52:32.060 --> 00:52:32.893
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

1740
00:52:32.980 --> 00:52:33.813
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting.</v>

1741
00:52:34.040 --> 00:52:34.370
<v Speaker 2>We didn't,</v>

1742
00:52:34.370 --> 00:52:37.700
<v Speaker 2>maybe we didn't have lamb growing up because it was a religious thing.</v>

1743
00:52:37.701 --> 00:52:40.880
<v Speaker 2>My mom was against it because it'll land was very biblical.</v>

1744
00:52:40.940 --> 00:52:41.773
<v Speaker 2>She would always say,</v>

1745
00:52:41.780 --> 00:52:43.700
<v Speaker 2>so I never ate lamb growing up.</v>

1746
00:52:43.970 --> 00:52:44.361
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

1747
00:52:44.361 --> 00:52:45.194
<v Speaker 2>Do you need it now?</v>

1748
00:52:45.500 --> 00:52:46.011
<v Speaker 2>I don't like it.</v>

1749
00:52:46.011 --> 00:52:46.581
<v Speaker 2>I tasted it.</v>

1750
00:52:46.581 --> 00:52:47.660
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it's just me going,</v>

1751
00:52:47.780 --> 00:52:48.440
<v Speaker 2>yeah man,</v>

1752
00:52:48.440 --> 00:52:49.460
<v Speaker 2>you just never had it.</v>

1753
00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:50.960
<v Speaker 2>No limbs delicious.</v>

1754
00:52:50.961 --> 00:52:51.681
<v Speaker 2>If it's prepared.</v>

1755
00:52:51.681 --> 00:52:52.190
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1756
00:52:52.190 --> 00:52:52.431
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1757
00:52:52.431 --> 00:52:54.180
<v Speaker 2>the idea behind it as that it's just not,</v>

1758
00:52:54.280 --> 00:52:54.780
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>

1759
00:52:54.780 --> 00:52:55.880
<v Speaker 2>doesn't have tough muscle.</v>

1760
00:52:55.910 --> 00:52:56.460
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1761
00:52:56.460 --> 00:52:56.631
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1762
00:52:56.631 --> 00:52:58.370
<v Speaker 2>that moves that I cooked the other day that I had in my,</v>

1763
00:52:58.371 --> 00:52:59.204
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1764
00:52:59.270 --> 00:53:00.103
<v Speaker 2>my Instagram.</v>

1765
00:53:00.440 --> 00:53:02.660
<v Speaker 2>That's not the most tender meat.</v>

1766
00:53:02.930 --> 00:53:04.850
<v Speaker 2>Like you have to cook it right.</v>

1767
00:53:05.150 --> 00:53:06.920
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise it can be kind of tough and chewy.</v>

1768
00:53:06.921 --> 00:53:08.660
<v Speaker 2>It's cause he got to Broil it.</v>

1769
00:53:09.440 --> 00:53:09.951
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1770
00:53:09.951 --> 00:53:12.590
<v Speaker 2>honestly the best way to do it really is doing it.</v>

1771
00:53:12.620 --> 00:53:14.620
<v Speaker 2>It's doing is probably the best way to deal with like the co,</v>

1772
00:53:14.720 --> 00:53:15.950
<v Speaker 2>the tougher cuts of meat,</v>

1773
00:53:15.980 --> 00:53:18.830
<v Speaker 2>like a slow it down for an hour and a half.</v>

1774
00:53:18.890 --> 00:53:19.090
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1775
00:53:19.090 --> 00:53:19.940
<v Speaker 2>no many hours.</v>

1776
00:53:19.950 --> 00:53:22.550
<v Speaker 2>You leave it off with five or six hours I'm doing and one like one of those</v>

1777
00:53:22.630 --> 00:53:25.830
<v Speaker 2>crockpots you know and all those pressure cookers.</v>

1778
00:53:25.831 --> 00:53:26.010
<v Speaker 2>Leave</v>

1779
00:53:26.010 --> 00:53:26.790
<v Speaker 1>it on.</v>

1780
00:53:26.790 --> 00:53:30.450
<v Speaker 1>It's not that hot and it just stays going all day and it breaks down all the</v>

1781
00:53:30.451 --> 00:53:32.070
<v Speaker 1>tissue and anything that's tough.</v>

1782
00:53:32.490 --> 00:53:34.200
<v Speaker 1>It makes it so that you could chew through it easy.</v>

1783
00:53:34.350 --> 00:53:35.161
<v Speaker 1>It says becomes real,</v>

1784
00:53:35.161 --> 00:53:35.431
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

1785
00:53:35.431 --> 00:53:36.264
<v Speaker 1>really tender.</v>

1786
00:53:36.390 --> 00:53:37.350
<v Speaker 1>But if you broil it,</v>

1787
00:53:37.380 --> 00:53:38.220
<v Speaker 1>I've never had moves.</v>

1788
00:53:38.221 --> 00:53:39.120
<v Speaker 1>What does it taste like?</v>

1789
00:53:39.720 --> 00:53:42.570
<v Speaker 1>Tastes like a cow.</v>

1790
00:53:42.571 --> 00:53:45.670
<v Speaker 1>Fuck the deer a little game.</v>

1791
00:53:46.270 --> 00:53:46.950
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1792
00:53:46.950 --> 00:53:47.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1793
00:53:47.370 --> 00:53:47.551
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1794
00:53:47.551 --> 00:53:49.620
<v Speaker 1>it's not gave me the board game.</v>

1795
00:53:49.621 --> 00:53:50.454
<v Speaker 1>He's a weird word.</v>

1796
00:53:50.460 --> 00:53:51.530
<v Speaker 1>What does that not mean?</v>

1797
00:53:52.170 --> 00:53:54.990
<v Speaker 1>Usually it means it's just been poorly prepared.</v>

1798
00:53:55.250 --> 00:53:55.651
<v Speaker 1>Does it?</v>

1799
00:53:55.651 --> 00:53:59.850
<v Speaker 1>Someone either didn't take care of the meat correctly or they let the tarsal</v>

1800
00:53:59.851 --> 00:54:02.130
<v Speaker 1>glands leak onto the flesh.</v>

1801
00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:03.181
<v Speaker 1>Like when,</v>

1802
00:54:03.181 --> 00:54:03.391
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1803
00:54:03.391 --> 00:54:03.930
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>

1804
00:54:03.930 --> 00:54:06.390
<v Speaker 1>especially when you get game animals like a deer,</v>

1805
00:54:06.720 --> 00:54:07.553
<v Speaker 1>when they're,</v>

1806
00:54:07.620 --> 00:54:08.730
<v Speaker 1>when they're being hunted,</v>

1807
00:54:08.731 --> 00:54:10.680
<v Speaker 1>a lot of times they're being hunted while they're breeding.</v>

1808
00:54:10.800 --> 00:54:12.030
<v Speaker 1>That's when what's called the Rut.</v>

1809
00:54:12.060 --> 00:54:13.110
<v Speaker 1>That's when people hunt them,</v>

1810
00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:14.220
<v Speaker 1>which is in November,</v>

1811
00:54:14.280 --> 00:54:14.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1812
00:54:14.600 --> 00:54:15.540
<v Speaker 1>in the fall rather.</v>

1813
00:54:16.420 --> 00:54:19.080
<v Speaker 1>And they have a gland on their legs called the tarsal glance.</v>

1814
00:54:19.081 --> 00:54:19.914
<v Speaker 1>Especially dear.</v>

1815
00:54:20.130 --> 00:54:21.720
<v Speaker 1>If you'd get that stuff on the meat,</v>

1816
00:54:21.750 --> 00:54:23.190
<v Speaker 1>it'll be funky as fuck.</v>

1817
00:54:23.191 --> 00:54:23.940
<v Speaker 1>It stinks.</v>

1818
00:54:23.940 --> 00:54:26.310
<v Speaker 1>It smells weird and we'll make the food taste weird.</v>

1819
00:54:26.311 --> 00:54:26.521
<v Speaker 1>It'll,</v>

1820
00:54:26.521 --> 00:54:27.360
<v Speaker 1>it'll ruin the meat.</v>

1821
00:54:28.690 --> 00:54:29.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1822
00:54:29.230 --> 00:54:30.000
<v Speaker 1>The Ken,</v>

1823
00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:30.930
<v Speaker 1>another thing can ruin the meat.</v>

1824
00:54:30.931 --> 00:54:33.090
<v Speaker 1>It's just letting it sit out too long,</v>

1825
00:54:33.091 --> 00:54:34.560
<v Speaker 1>letting it go bad.</v>

1826
00:54:34.561 --> 00:54:38.900
<v Speaker 1>That can the or bugs or it get x.</v>

1827
00:54:38.930 --> 00:54:43.930
<v Speaker 1>It could get exposed to the Oregon meet the rotting Oregon meet before a while,</v>

1828
00:54:44.161 --> 00:54:44.361
<v Speaker 1>while,</v>

1829
00:54:44.361 --> 00:54:45.780
<v Speaker 1>while it's too warm,</v>

1830
00:54:46.200 --> 00:54:47.190
<v Speaker 1>like that can happen.</v>

1831
00:54:47.400 --> 00:54:48.030
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1832
00:54:48.030 --> 00:54:49.260
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of things that can go wrong,</v>

1833
00:54:49.261 --> 00:54:50.790
<v Speaker 1>but most of it is preparation.</v>

1834
00:54:50.970 --> 00:54:52.620
<v Speaker 1>If you have deer that's prepared,</v>

1835
00:54:52.621 --> 00:54:53.160
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1836
00:54:53.160 --> 00:54:54.540
<v Speaker 1>If you get an animal,</v>

1837
00:54:54.541 --> 00:54:55.740
<v Speaker 1>it's taken care of correctly,</v>

1838
00:54:55.741 --> 00:54:56.574
<v Speaker 1>butchered correctly.</v>

1839
00:54:56.790 --> 00:54:57.630
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't taste game.</v>

1840
00:54:57.631 --> 00:54:58.830
<v Speaker 1>It all tastes delicious.</v>

1841
00:54:59.040 --> 00:55:00.090
<v Speaker 1>Definitely tastes different.</v>

1842
00:55:00.600 --> 00:55:00.900
<v Speaker 1>But they,</v>

1843
00:55:00.900 --> 00:55:01.531
<v Speaker 1>as they get older,</v>

1844
00:55:01.531 --> 00:55:02.364
<v Speaker 1>they get funk here.</v>

1845
00:55:02.490 --> 00:55:04.140
<v Speaker 1>Like you get like a real old buck,</v>

1846
00:55:04.700 --> 00:55:05.010
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1847
00:55:05.010 --> 00:55:08.160
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's kind of weird that everybody wants to shoot the big old ones</v>

1848
00:55:08.161 --> 00:55:11.400
<v Speaker 1>with the giant antlers because those are the ones that kind of tastes like shit.</v>

1849
00:55:11.880 --> 00:55:15.000
<v Speaker 1>But you want a young deer for food.</v>

1850
00:55:15.060 --> 00:55:15.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1851
00:55:15.630 --> 00:55:16.590
<v Speaker 1>you want a young deer.</v>

1852
00:55:16.620 --> 00:55:21.620
<v Speaker 1>But for conservation you kind of want an old deer because the old deer runs off</v>

1853
00:55:22.231 --> 00:55:24.270
<v Speaker 1>the young deer and keeps them from breeding.</v>

1854
00:55:24.271 --> 00:55:25.650
<v Speaker 1>And maybe the young deer,</v>

1855
00:55:25.830 --> 00:55:30.510
<v Speaker 1>maybe it'd be better if we got more than me young genetics into the,</v>

1856
00:55:30.511 --> 00:55:31.200
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1857
00:55:31.200 --> 00:55:33.580
<v Speaker 1>into the food system there and to the uh,</v>

1858
00:55:34.120 --> 00:55:34.953
<v Speaker 1>lifecycle there,</v>

1859
00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:35.873
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1860
00:55:36.620 --> 00:55:37.151
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1861
00:55:37.151 --> 00:55:37.650
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1862
00:55:37.650 --> 00:55:38.281
<v Speaker 1>these deer,</v>

1863
00:55:38.281 --> 00:55:39.180
<v Speaker 1>how long do they,</v>

1864
00:55:39.690 --> 00:55:40.290
<v Speaker 1>how long,</v>

1865
00:55:40.290 --> 00:55:41.123
<v Speaker 1>like how old,</v>

1866
00:55:41.490 --> 00:55:42.121
<v Speaker 1>how old is it?</v>

1867
00:55:42.121 --> 00:55:43.890
<v Speaker 1>Old Dear old,</v>

1868
00:55:43.920 --> 00:55:45.750
<v Speaker 1>old dearly eight years old.</v>

1869
00:55:46.470 --> 00:55:48.990
<v Speaker 1>Eight years old is really what his short life,</v>

1870
00:55:48.991 --> 00:55:49.920
<v Speaker 1>they have both,</v>

1871
00:55:49.921 --> 00:55:53.250
<v Speaker 1>their life is just jumping over barbwire and dodge and coyote.</v>

1872
00:55:54.740 --> 00:55:55.340
<v Speaker 1>Unless you,</v>

1873
00:55:55.340 --> 00:56:00.340
<v Speaker 1>you leaving one of those areas where now has like a deer sign where you might</v>

1874
00:56:00.721 --> 00:56:01.710
<v Speaker 1>get hit by a car.</v>

1875
00:56:01.860 --> 00:56:05.100
<v Speaker 1>A good majority of them either freeze to death or starve to death.</v>

1876
00:56:05.190 --> 00:56:06.060
<v Speaker 1>That happens a lot.</v>

1877
00:56:07.080 --> 00:56:08.010
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say majority,</v>

1878
00:56:08.011 --> 00:56:09.000
<v Speaker 1>but a good percentage.</v>

1879
00:56:09.390 --> 00:56:11.700
<v Speaker 1>The most of them get taken out by predators.</v>

1880
00:56:11.820 --> 00:56:13.410
<v Speaker 1>Most of them or cars,</v>

1881
00:56:13.440 --> 00:56:14.700
<v Speaker 1>they get hit by cars a lot.</v>

1882
00:56:14.970 --> 00:56:17.340
<v Speaker 1>Like the end of the numbers that get killed by hunters.</v>

1883
00:56:17.820 --> 00:56:18.960
<v Speaker 1>I wonder what the number is.</v>

1884
00:56:19.770 --> 00:56:20.430
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1885
00:56:20.430 --> 00:56:21.720
<v Speaker 1>in some places for sure.</v>

1886
00:56:21.790 --> 00:56:22.980
<v Speaker 1>Some places there's hundreds of,</v>

1887
00:56:23.500 --> 00:56:24.333
<v Speaker 1>of deaths,</v>

1888
00:56:24.360 --> 00:56:24.710
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1889
00:56:24.710 --> 00:56:26.470
<v Speaker 6>of deer killed by cars every year,</v>

1890
00:56:26.471 --> 00:56:31.180
<v Speaker 6>I think in like Michigan to find out how many deer killed by car accidents in</v>

1891
00:56:31.181 --> 00:56:31.570
<v Speaker 6>Michigan.</v>

1892
00:56:31.570 --> 00:56:33.550
<v Speaker 6>There's places in this country that are overrun with deer,</v>

1893
00:56:33.760 --> 00:56:37.030
<v Speaker 6>like people that live in like Manhattan and go leave those deer alone.</v>

1894
00:56:37.031 --> 00:56:37.890
<v Speaker 6>They're beautiful.</v>

1895
00:56:38.410 --> 00:56:41.980
<v Speaker 6>A deer crashed through the dorm window in my dorm.</v>

1896
00:56:42.260 --> 00:56:43.093
<v Speaker 6>Whoa.</v>

1897
00:56:44.010 --> 00:56:44.920
<v Speaker 6>Doing something in there.</v>

1898
00:56:45.040 --> 00:56:45.311
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

1899
00:56:45.311 --> 00:56:48.010
<v Speaker 6>it was Easter weekend and this,</v>

1900
00:56:48.250 --> 00:56:50.770
<v Speaker 6>we woke up and on a Sunday and there was only,</v>

1901
00:56:50.771 --> 00:56:55.330
<v Speaker 6>it was so creepy because everybody went home for Easter weekend except for a few</v>

1902
00:56:55.390 --> 00:56:56.223
<v Speaker 6>kids.</v>

1903
00:56:56.230 --> 00:56:57.550
<v Speaker 6>So I was one of them.</v>

1904
00:56:57.580 --> 00:56:58.413
<v Speaker 6>And we're,</v>

1905
00:56:58.780 --> 00:57:03.780
<v Speaker 6>we wake up and go downstairs and there's blood all over the lobby of our dorm.</v>

1906
00:57:05.320 --> 00:57:05.830
<v Speaker 6>Whoa.</v>

1907
00:57:05.830 --> 00:57:06.663
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1908
00:57:06.820 --> 00:57:07.653
<v Speaker 6>Whoa.</v>

1909
00:57:07.950 --> 00:57:08.711
<v Speaker 6>I like this dear.</v>

1910
00:57:08.711 --> 00:57:09.820
<v Speaker 6>Just jumped in.</v>

1911
00:57:11.020 --> 00:57:11.291
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1912
00:57:11.291 --> 00:57:11.931
<v Speaker 6>that should happen.</v>

1913
00:57:11.931 --> 00:57:12.820
<v Speaker 6>So my friend Cam,</v>

1914
00:57:12.890 --> 00:57:13.360
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1915
00:57:13.360 --> 00:57:17.260
<v Speaker 6>some guy died in his neighborhood because he was driving home and the car in</v>

1916
00:57:17.261 --> 00:57:19.780
<v Speaker 6>front of him hit a deer current front of him,</v>

1917
00:57:19.781 --> 00:57:20.560
<v Speaker 6>hit a deer.</v>

1918
00:57:20.560 --> 00:57:25.560
<v Speaker 6>The deer went over the roof of that guy's car and crash through his windshield</v>

1919
00:57:25.661 --> 00:57:27.050
<v Speaker 6>and killed him hollering,</v>

1920
00:57:27.080 --> 00:57:28.000
<v Speaker 6>shit,</v>

1921
00:57:29.950 --> 00:57:30.783
<v Speaker 6>what the fuck?</v>

1922
00:57:31.090 --> 00:57:32.740
<v Speaker 6>We need deer proof windows.</v>

1923
00:57:32.880 --> 00:57:33.400
<v Speaker 6>You're dealing,</v>

1924
00:57:33.400 --> 00:57:34.840
<v Speaker 6>if you're dealing with a big deer,</v>

1925
00:57:34.841 --> 00:57:39.000
<v Speaker 6>you're dealing with at least 150 pounds of,</v>

1926
00:57:39.001 --> 00:57:39.421
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1927
00:57:39.421 --> 00:57:40.990
<v Speaker 6>of bones and meat.</v>

1928
00:57:41.010 --> 00:57:41.843
<v Speaker 6>Oh God.</v>

1929
00:57:42.210 --> 00:57:43.420
<v Speaker 6>13 look at this.</v>

1930
00:57:43.421 --> 00:57:44.890
<v Speaker 6>This number is going to blow you away.</v>

1931
00:57:45.190 --> 00:57:50.190
<v Speaker 6>2013 there were 49,205 reported car deer crashes in the state of Michigan.</v>

1932
00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:58.810
<v Speaker 6>What the fuck that translates into one car,</v>

1933
00:57:58.811 --> 00:57:59.860
<v Speaker 6>dear crash,</v>

1934
00:57:59.890 --> 00:58:01.330
<v Speaker 6>every nine minutes.</v>

1935
00:58:01.480 --> 00:58:02.080
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>

1936
00:58:02.080 --> 00:58:06.790
<v Speaker 6>These crashes are at least $130 million a year.</v>

1937
00:58:07.720 --> 00:58:08.620
<v Speaker 6>Oh my God.</v>

1938
00:58:10.030 --> 00:58:10.661
<v Speaker 6>In Ohio,</v>

1939
00:58:10.661 --> 00:58:12.450
<v Speaker 6>I had does whistles on my car.</v>

1940
00:58:12.460 --> 00:58:14.760
<v Speaker 6>I'd always make sure that was the first thing I put on my car.</v>

1941
00:58:14.761 --> 00:58:15.041
<v Speaker 6>He says,</v>

1942
00:58:15.041 --> 00:58:15.281
<v Speaker 6>dear,</v>

1943
00:58:15.281 --> 00:58:16.420
<v Speaker 6>whistles on my kids are good,</v>

1944
00:58:16.421 --> 00:58:17.350
<v Speaker 6>but they don't always work.</v>

1945
00:58:17.860 --> 00:58:20.230
<v Speaker 6>You need one of those goddamn battering ram bumper.</v>

1946
00:58:20.231 --> 00:58:23.560
<v Speaker 6>So you ever see those bumpers that they make just for deer in places where</v>

1947
00:58:23.561 --> 00:58:27.850
<v Speaker 6>people live when they run into deer so often they actually have bumpers that are</v>

1948
00:58:27.851 --> 00:58:29.110
<v Speaker 6>designed to,</v>

1949
00:58:29.111 --> 00:58:31.960
<v Speaker 6>they like the front of them has like an angle.</v>

1950
00:58:31.990 --> 00:58:32.950
<v Speaker 6>So if they hit the deer,</v>

1951
00:58:32.951 --> 00:58:34.660
<v Speaker 6>the deer goes flying off the sides.</v>

1952
00:58:34.661 --> 00:58:35.494
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1953
00:58:35.590 --> 00:58:36.423
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1954
00:58:36.520 --> 00:58:37.091
<v Speaker 6>Those are,</v>

1955
00:58:37.091 --> 00:58:37.601
<v Speaker 6>those are,</v>

1956
00:58:37.601 --> 00:58:38.800
<v Speaker 6>those are pretty good ones.</v>

1957
00:58:38.801 --> 00:58:39.850
<v Speaker 6>The one the far right.</v>

1958
00:58:39.940 --> 00:58:40.511
<v Speaker 6>Not that one,</v>

1959
00:58:40.511 --> 00:58:40.900
<v Speaker 6>Jamie.</v>

1960
00:58:40.900 --> 00:58:41.620
<v Speaker 6>Not that one.</v>

1961
00:58:41.620 --> 00:58:42.453
<v Speaker 6>The one.</v>

1962
00:58:42.580 --> 00:58:42.790
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1963
00:58:42.790 --> 00:58:43.623
<v Speaker 6>look at that one.</v>

1964
00:58:43.630 --> 00:58:44.650
<v Speaker 6>Look at that one ahead of the deer.</v>

1965
00:58:44.651 --> 00:58:45.484
<v Speaker 6>Stuck in it.</v>

1966
00:58:46.090 --> 00:58:46.923
<v Speaker 6>Boom.</v>

1967
00:58:47.110 --> 00:58:48.190
<v Speaker 6>That's crazy.</v>

1968
00:58:48.910 --> 00:58:49.743
<v Speaker 6>That's fucked up.</v>

1969
00:58:50.050 --> 00:58:51.310
<v Speaker 6>But the first semi trucks,</v>

1970
00:58:51.311 --> 00:58:54.700
<v Speaker 6>it's a huge problem because obviously they drive the one down there.</v>

1971
00:58:54.701 --> 00:58:55.870
<v Speaker 6>Keep going right there.</v>

1972
00:58:55.930 --> 00:58:56.351
<v Speaker 6>Right there.</v>

1973
00:58:56.351 --> 00:58:57.130
<v Speaker 6>That's it.</v>

1974
00:58:57.130 --> 00:58:58.360
<v Speaker 6>See how it's all over the uh,</v>

1975
00:58:58.361 --> 00:58:59.194
<v Speaker 6>the top.</v>

1976
00:58:59.620 --> 00:59:02.140
<v Speaker 6>It's over the top of the hood and everything as well.</v>

1977
00:59:02.260 --> 00:59:03.490
<v Speaker 6>That's just in case.</v>

1978
00:59:03.580 --> 00:59:03.760
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

1979
00:59:03.760 --> 00:59:07.450
<v Speaker 6>the thing comes up and over the top of the hood that it doesn't crush the hood</v>

1980
00:59:07.760 --> 00:59:09.790
<v Speaker 6>and disable the engine.</v>

1981
00:59:10.030 --> 00:59:13.060
<v Speaker 6>But most of them are designed so that when it hits the thing,</v>

1982
00:59:13.061 --> 00:59:15.580
<v Speaker 6>it bounces them off the left or the right.</v>

1983
00:59:16.300 --> 00:59:17.920
<v Speaker 6>It says she was problem in a lot of areas.</v>

1984
00:59:17.921 --> 00:59:18.580
<v Speaker 6>Car,</v>

1985
00:59:18.580 --> 00:59:20.260
<v Speaker 6>exactly to protect.</v>

1986
00:59:20.261 --> 00:59:21.120
<v Speaker 6>The car doesn't,</v>

1987
00:59:21.370 --> 00:59:22.800
<v Speaker 6>but the deer gets mangled in there.</v>

1988
00:59:22.801 --> 00:59:25.100
<v Speaker 6>At least you still have to stop.</v>

1989
00:59:25.160 --> 00:59:25.761
<v Speaker 6>You stopped,</v>

1990
00:59:25.761 --> 00:59:26.331
<v Speaker 6>you pull it out.</v>

1991
00:59:26.331 --> 00:59:27.380
<v Speaker 6>What do you buy your business?</v>

1992
00:59:27.410 --> 00:59:27.561
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1993
00:59:27.561 --> 00:59:28.730
<v Speaker 6>Do you have to do that or is there,</v>

1994
00:59:28.731 --> 00:59:30.020
<v Speaker 6>somebody could call it a day that,</v>

1995
00:59:30.021 --> 00:59:32.270
<v Speaker 6>cause I'm not going to want to call a tow truck company.</v>

1996
00:59:32.570 --> 00:59:34.190
<v Speaker 6>I'm sure he could call someone to do it.</v>

1997
00:59:34.191 --> 00:59:35.000
<v Speaker 6>If you paid them,</v>

1998
00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:35.930
<v Speaker 6>I'm sure someone would do it,</v>

1999
00:59:35.931 --> 00:59:36.830
<v Speaker 6>but it's not that hard.</v>

2000
00:59:37.250 --> 00:59:38.240
<v Speaker 6>You just drive off.</v>

2001
00:59:38.290 --> 00:59:40.850
<v Speaker 6>But if you're trying to get Wifi and get on craigslist,</v>

2002
00:59:40.851 --> 00:59:44.090
<v Speaker 6>looking for somebody to remove deer from Lane Dashboard,</v>

2003
00:59:44.450 --> 00:59:46.310
<v Speaker 6>I'm on 95 exit 18.</v>

2004
00:59:47.150 --> 00:59:50.030
<v Speaker 6>I think the people that don't live anywhere around those animals would never</v>

2005
00:59:50.031 --> 00:59:54.890
<v Speaker 6>imagine that there's 49,000 car accidents a year in a fucking state where cars</v>

2006
00:59:54.891 --> 00:59:55.520
<v Speaker 6>had deer.</v>

2007
00:59:55.520 --> 00:59:56.750
<v Speaker 6>But if you're ever around Michigan,</v>

2008
00:59:56.751 --> 00:59:59.600
<v Speaker 6>you would know this should be Trump's new platform.</v>

2009
01:00:00.250 --> 01:00:03.130
<v Speaker 6>Let's lower the amount of crashes caused by deer.</v>

2010
01:00:03.720 --> 01:00:04.200
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2011
01:00:04.200 --> 01:00:05.033
<v Speaker 6>he needs,</v>

2012
01:00:05.390 --> 01:00:07.430
<v Speaker 6>he needs to focus on something else right now.</v>

2013
01:00:07.780 --> 01:00:08.421
<v Speaker 6>Number one,</v>

2014
01:00:08.421 --> 01:00:09.800
<v Speaker 6>why does he need to focus on anything?</v>

2015
01:00:09.830 --> 01:00:10.790
<v Speaker 6>You know what it seems to me,</v>

2016
01:00:10.820 --> 01:00:12.080
<v Speaker 6>I don't know anything about politics,</v>

2017
01:00:12.081 --> 01:00:15.140
<v Speaker 6>but what it seems to me on the outside not knowing anything about it,</v>

2018
01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:18.510
<v Speaker 6>it seems to me like everybody else is laying back there waiting and they're</v>

2019
01:00:18.511 --> 01:00:22.730
<v Speaker 6>letting Donald just Jizz just letting Donald get out there and fucking jerk off</v>

2020
01:00:22.731 --> 01:00:23.750
<v Speaker 6>and make all this noise.</v>

2021
01:00:23.780 --> 01:00:24.920
<v Speaker 6>No one's no other.</v>

2022
01:00:25.010 --> 01:00:29.120
<v Speaker 6>Republican's are being loud like Jeb Bush is being very quiet.</v>

2023
01:00:29.330 --> 01:00:30.190
<v Speaker 6>No one's opposing him.</v>

2024
01:00:30.900 --> 01:00:33.110
<v Speaker 6>Let him act like a fool.</v>

2025
01:00:33.170 --> 01:00:33.980
<v Speaker 6>Chris Christie,</v>

2026
01:00:33.980 --> 01:00:34.581
<v Speaker 6>that guy,</v>

2027
01:00:34.581 --> 01:00:37.220
<v Speaker 6>he goes on the news and all he does is talk about pot.</v>

2028
01:00:37.430 --> 01:00:37.701
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2029
01:00:37.701 --> 01:00:38.420
<v Speaker 6>if you're,</v>

2030
01:00:38.420 --> 01:00:41.960
<v Speaker 6>if you're enjoying what he's trying to do is trying to not be president.</v>

2031
01:00:42.200 --> 01:00:47.200
<v Speaker 6>I think that slob has like some crazy criminal fucking skeletons in his closet</v>

2032
01:00:47.781 --> 01:00:50.960
<v Speaker 6>from shit that he did in New Jersey that's completely not kosher.</v>

2033
01:00:51.260 --> 01:00:51.950
<v Speaker 6>And he just like,</v>

2034
01:00:51.950 --> 01:00:53.120
<v Speaker 6>if he becomes president,</v>

2035
01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:54.380
<v Speaker 6>all that Shit's going to leak out.</v>

2036
01:00:54.381 --> 01:00:58.190
<v Speaker 6>So I think he's trying to ruin it now by like saying if you're smoking pot,</v>

2037
01:00:58.220 --> 01:00:59.090
<v Speaker 6>Colorado,</v>

2038
01:00:59.220 --> 01:01:01.250
<v Speaker 6>enjoy it now because when I'm president,</v>

2039
01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:02.570
<v Speaker 6>all that stuff he's saying like,</v>

2040
01:01:02.571 --> 01:01:03.830
<v Speaker 6>why would you say stuff like that?</v>

2041
01:01:03.831 --> 01:01:08.330
<v Speaker 6>You know what popular opinion is popular opinion is Colorado's making millions</v>

2042
01:01:08.330 --> 01:01:09.890
<v Speaker 6>of dollars a year in tax revenue.</v>

2043
01:01:10.010 --> 01:01:12.830
<v Speaker 6>They have the lowest incidence of drunk driving they've ever reported.</v>

2044
01:01:12.950 --> 01:01:14.600
<v Speaker 6>They have lower incidents then uh,</v>

2045
01:01:14.601 --> 01:01:17.300
<v Speaker 6>in violent crime they've had in a long fucking time.</v>

2046
01:01:17.510 --> 01:01:19.460
<v Speaker 6>And a lot of this is attributed to marijuana.</v>

2047
01:01:19.580 --> 01:01:21.840
<v Speaker 6>So a rational fucking person looking at that,</v>

2048
01:01:21.841 --> 01:01:22.041
<v Speaker 6>we'll say,</v>

2049
01:01:22.041 --> 01:01:22.371
<v Speaker 6>well look,</v>

2050
01:01:22.371 --> 01:01:23.510
<v Speaker 6>it's good money for the state.</v>

2051
01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:24.800
<v Speaker 6>Even if you're conservative,</v>

2052
01:01:24.980 --> 01:01:25.491
<v Speaker 6>what do you want?</v>

2053
01:01:25.491 --> 01:01:27.830
<v Speaker 6>You want more tax revenue so we can hire more cops,</v>

2054
01:01:27.950 --> 01:01:28.783
<v Speaker 6>more fire,</v>

2055
01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:30.050
<v Speaker 6>more fire people,</v>

2056
01:01:30.110 --> 01:01:31.580
<v Speaker 6>more more teachers.</v>

2057
01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:32.151
<v Speaker 6>That's like a,</v>

2058
01:01:32.151 --> 01:01:33.410
<v Speaker 6>what a conservative person would look at it.</v>

2059
01:01:33.411 --> 01:01:33.531
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

2060
01:01:33.531 --> 01:01:35.900
<v Speaker 6>this is a smart way to do it cause it's fiscally prudent.</v>

2061
01:01:36.110 --> 01:01:41.110
<v Speaker 6>But know that Slob in my state fucking bagels fallen out of his face.</v>

2062
01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:45.710
<v Speaker 6>Who could run for president?</v>

2063
01:01:45.711 --> 01:01:46.790
<v Speaker 6>There should be a weight limit.</v>

2064
01:01:46.910 --> 01:01:47.181
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

2065
01:01:47.181 --> 01:01:48.260
<v Speaker 6>because you could be a giant.</v>

2066
01:01:48.261 --> 01:01:48.891
<v Speaker 6>It'd be awesome.</v>

2067
01:01:48.891 --> 01:01:52.010
<v Speaker 6>Like what if you're like some seven foot two to waste 500 pounds.</v>

2068
01:01:52.180 --> 01:01:52.491
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

2069
01:01:52.491 --> 01:01:54.920
<v Speaker 6>How about your proportionate body fat percentage?</v>

2070
01:01:54.921 --> 01:01:55.910
<v Speaker 6>We would never let that happen.</v>

2071
01:01:56.220 --> 01:02:00.800
<v Speaker 6>If there was a seven foot two dude with a giant fucking fire hydrant dick and he</v>

2072
01:02:00.801 --> 01:02:03.410
<v Speaker 6>wanted to be president and he was smart in every way,</v>

2073
01:02:03.411 --> 01:02:03.940
<v Speaker 6>we'd be like,</v>

2074
01:02:03.940 --> 01:02:04.773
<v Speaker 6>hm,</v>

2075
01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:05.390
<v Speaker 6>how do we,</v>

2076
01:02:05.390 --> 01:02:06.820
<v Speaker 6>how do we know his Dick was that?</v>

2077
01:02:08.860 --> 01:02:11.120
<v Speaker 6>Every time he talks Jon Hamm photo shoot,</v>

2078
01:02:11.470 --> 01:02:14.300
<v Speaker 6>he just stands there and he's got this giant wad in his pants and everybody's</v>

2079
01:02:14.330 --> 01:02:14.511
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

2080
01:02:14.511 --> 01:02:15.260
<v Speaker 6>I think,</v>

2081
01:02:15.260 --> 01:02:19.410
<v Speaker 6>I mean it's got to look at the signs of them and they just assume they guys have</v>

2082
01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:20.250
<v Speaker 6>big dicks.</v>

2083
01:02:20.250 --> 01:02:21.600
<v Speaker 2>Someone knows more than we do.</v>

2084
01:02:22.110 --> 01:02:22.381
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2085
01:02:22.381 --> 01:02:23.520
<v Speaker 2>is that your ratio?</v>

2086
01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:24.481
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2087
01:02:24.481 --> 01:02:25.314
<v Speaker 2>I'd be noticed.</v>

2088
01:02:25.740 --> 01:02:26.131
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2089
01:02:26.131 --> 01:02:26.560
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

2090
01:02:26.560 --> 01:02:27.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm just guessing</v>

2091
01:02:29.190 --> 01:02:30.000
<v Speaker 2>because it just,</v>

2092
01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:30.833
<v Speaker 2>it is what it,</v>

2093
01:02:31.470 --> 01:02:32.460
<v Speaker 2>it just wouldn't,</v>

2094
01:02:33.060 --> 01:02:33.460
<v Speaker 2>it wouldn't,</v>

2095
01:02:33.460 --> 01:02:33.871
<v Speaker 2>it wouldn't,</v>

2096
01:02:33.871 --> 01:02:34.171
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2097
01:02:34.171 --> 01:02:37.650
<v Speaker 2>cause they already have the height so it just wouldn't be fair for them to have</v>

2098
01:02:37.651 --> 01:02:39.840
<v Speaker 2>a big Dick and hike and get the girls.</v>

2099
01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:41.340
<v Speaker 2>So you think the world's fair</v>

2100
01:02:47.010 --> 01:02:50.010
<v Speaker 2>giant heads and huge teeth and antelopes on of guns.</v>

2101
01:02:50.011 --> 01:02:51.480
<v Speaker 2>This is not a fair world we're living in.</v>

2102
01:02:51.481 --> 01:02:52.314
<v Speaker 2>How dare you?</v>

2103
01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:53.673
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make any sense.</v>

2104
01:02:55.060 --> 01:02:56.710
<v Speaker 2>I've seen short guys with big Dicks,</v>

2105
01:02:56.711 --> 01:02:59.580
<v Speaker 2>so I just assumed that tall guys must have small dicks.</v>

2106
01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:00.540
<v Speaker 2>Well that's good math.</v>

2107
01:03:00.541 --> 01:03:01.560
<v Speaker 2>You should probably,</v>

2108
01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:03.480
<v Speaker 2>she probably worked for the governor then.</v>

2109
01:03:03.940 --> 01:03:08.340
<v Speaker 2>See I would think everything is proportional to most parts of your big tall guy</v>

2110
01:03:08.341 --> 01:03:08.851
<v Speaker 2>with big,</v>

2111
01:03:08.851 --> 01:03:09.571
<v Speaker 2>big feet.</v>

2112
01:03:09.571 --> 01:03:13.040
<v Speaker 2>You probably have a bigger dick than a normal guy.</v>

2113
01:03:13.850 --> 01:03:16.290
<v Speaker 2>You're not thinking that well that doesn't make any sense</v>

2114
01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:21.121
<v Speaker 2>to you.</v>

2115
01:03:21.121 --> 01:03:21.954
<v Speaker 2>It makes sense.</v>

2116
01:03:22.170 --> 01:03:23.310
<v Speaker 2>As long as it makes sense to you.</v>

2117
01:03:23.311 --> 01:03:27.240
<v Speaker 2>See that means that you have fucked a very couple of big tall guys and both of</v>

2118
01:03:27.241 --> 01:03:27.421
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

2119
01:03:27.421 --> 01:03:31.190
<v Speaker 2>they're Dixon weren't as big as you wanted and you're projecting it on.</v>

2120
01:03:31.570 --> 01:03:35.390
<v Speaker 2>I saw a tall guy with a small penis one time.</v>

2121
01:03:35.550 --> 01:03:36.383
<v Speaker 2>One time.</v>

2122
01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:42.330
<v Speaker 2>One time I saw a Chinese black girlfriend,</v>

2123
01:03:43.290 --> 01:03:46.170
<v Speaker 2>so I'm basing all Chinese dudes date black girls.</v>

2124
01:03:46.260 --> 01:03:46.930
<v Speaker 2>I get what you're saying.</v>

2125
01:03:46.930 --> 01:03:49.680
<v Speaker 2>I think all Asian girls have small vaginas like,</v>

2126
01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:51.360
<v Speaker 2>like length wise.</v>

2127
01:03:51.470 --> 01:03:51.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2128
01:03:51.820 --> 01:03:52.320
<v Speaker 2>that's a,</v>

2129
01:03:52.320 --> 01:03:54.270
<v Speaker 2>that's a actual stereotype.</v>

2130
01:03:54.420 --> 01:03:55.900
<v Speaker 2>It's like black eyes having big dicks.</v>

2131
01:03:55.901 --> 01:03:56.380
<v Speaker 2>That's a start.</v>

2132
01:03:56.380 --> 01:03:57.870
<v Speaker 2>Like you're not going out on a limb there,</v>

2133
01:03:58.050 --> 01:04:00.990
<v Speaker 2>but giant dudes have little dicks.</v>

2134
01:04:01.290 --> 01:04:01.980
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

2135
01:04:01.980 --> 01:04:02.940
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't make sense.</v>

2136
01:04:02.970 --> 01:04:03.803
<v Speaker 2>That's going on on</v>

2137
01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:07.010
<v Speaker 2>that day.</v>

2138
01:04:07.010 --> 01:04:07.843
<v Speaker 2>A little dicks.</v>

2139
01:04:08.550 --> 01:04:09.383
<v Speaker 2>How ironic.</v>

2140
01:04:14.040 --> 01:04:15.120
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>

2141
01:04:16.790 --> 01:04:18.000
<v Speaker 2>that is so ridiculous.</v>

2142
01:04:19.230 --> 01:04:21.270
<v Speaker 2>I love being stupid.</v>

2143
01:04:22.140 --> 01:04:23.490
<v Speaker 2>How long are you going to be in La for?</v>

2144
01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:24.570
<v Speaker 2>Till Saturday.</v>

2145
01:04:24.570 --> 01:04:25.351
<v Speaker 2>You got gigs on here.</v>

2146
01:04:25.351 --> 01:04:26.184
<v Speaker 2>What are you doing?</v>

2147
01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:31.040
<v Speaker 2>This is going on right now.</v>

2148
01:04:33.690 --> 01:04:38.690
<v Speaker 2>What is the Common Union Comedy Club?</v>

2149
01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:42.793
<v Speaker 2>Have you heard of it?</v>

2150
01:04:47.270 --> 01:04:50.520
<v Speaker 2>Do you have black comedy that you do specifically for these African American</v>

2151
01:04:50.521 --> 01:04:52.890
<v Speaker 2>rooms or does it like you just do your own act?</v>

01:09:09.410 --> 01:09:10.140
<v Speaker 2>Hello.</v>

2295
01:09:10.140 --> 01:09:13.460
<v Speaker 2>And no one would catch it for like a minute or so.</v>

2296
01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:16.310
<v Speaker 2>And you would be like working construction cycle.</v>

2297
01:09:16.311 --> 01:09:17.720
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck?</v>

2298
01:09:17.900 --> 01:09:19.550
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ get it right.</v>

2299
01:09:19.551 --> 01:09:21.150
<v Speaker 2>You fucks yelling at them.</v>

2300
01:09:21.151 --> 01:09:25.340
<v Speaker 2>And then finally someone would correct it when I'm like a bathroom break and</v>

2301
01:09:25.341 --> 01:09:28.820
<v Speaker 2>just let the record like repeat for like three minutes maybe.</v>

2302
01:09:28.850 --> 01:09:29.780
<v Speaker 2>Probably cigarettes.</v>

2303
01:09:30.250 --> 01:09:30.750
<v Speaker 2>They'd probably say,</v>

2304
01:09:30.750 --> 01:09:32.800
<v Speaker 2>well they probably smoking cigarettes in the billings back though.</v>

2305
01:09:32.801 --> 01:09:33.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2306
01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:33.411
<v Speaker 2>totally.</v>

2307
01:09:33.411 --> 01:09:34.244
<v Speaker 2>And the buildings.</v>

2308
01:09:34.470 --> 01:09:37.430
<v Speaker 2>Remember Greg Fitzsimmons telling about his parents smoking cigarettes in the</v>

2309
01:09:37.431 --> 01:09:38.900
<v Speaker 2>house in the middle of the winter,</v>

2310
01:09:39.020 --> 01:09:44.020
<v Speaker 2>all the windows rolled up and solid tight and he's just living as a little kid</v>

2311
01:09:44.751 --> 01:09:46.580
<v Speaker 2>in this house filled with chain smokers.</v>

2312
01:09:46.840 --> 01:09:47.673
<v Speaker 2>That's how my,</v>

2313
01:09:48.170 --> 01:09:49.250
<v Speaker 2>my best friend growing up,</v>

2314
01:09:49.251 --> 01:09:51.770
<v Speaker 2>his parents and I just stayed at his house every single day.</v>

2315
01:09:51.910 --> 01:09:55.790
<v Speaker 2>And in the cars they would have the windows rolled up in the cars during rain.</v>

2316
01:09:56.030 --> 01:09:57.680
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing about those talk shows too.</v>

2317
01:09:57.681 --> 01:10:00.050
<v Speaker 2>They all used to smoke cigarettes on the talk show.</v>

2318
01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:03.230
<v Speaker 2>They'd all be sitting there like Johnny Carson used to smoke cigarettes.</v>

2319
01:10:03.350 --> 01:10:04.570
<v Speaker 2>See if you can find a video of that.</v>

2320
01:10:04.571 --> 01:10:08.930
<v Speaker 2>Cause it's so weird to watch Johnny Carson Smoking cigarettes on the tonight</v>

2321
01:10:08.931 --> 01:10:12.860
<v Speaker 2>show and be like guess would be there and he would have an ash tray right there</v>

2322
01:10:12.861 --> 01:10:17.861
<v Speaker 2>and they would just now when we'd is legalized in all 50 states,</v>

2323
01:10:18.680 --> 01:10:20.960
<v Speaker 2>then we'll just be smoking weed on the tonight show.</v>

2324
01:10:21.050 --> 01:10:21.381
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2325
01:10:21.381 --> 01:10:26.381
<v Speaker 2>because you hotbox people you know like that Gig and Toronto didn't wear a mask.</v>

2326
01:10:28.830 --> 01:10:29.570
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2327
01:10:29.570 --> 01:10:31.100
<v Speaker 2>how about you don't smoke weed in front of you?</v>

2328
01:10:31.101 --> 01:10:35.150
<v Speaker 2>I might just have an edible or smoke outside or like some host will just be</v>

2329
01:10:35.151 --> 01:10:36.050
<v Speaker 2>smoking weed.</v>

2330
01:10:36.980 --> 01:10:37.361
<v Speaker 2>Look at you.</v>

2331
01:10:37.361 --> 01:10:41.330
<v Speaker 2>Imagine if you were in a bar and the other people drinking got you drunk,</v>

2332
01:10:42.500 --> 01:10:43.340
<v Speaker 2>that'd be fucked.</v>

2333
01:10:43.460 --> 01:10:44.293
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2334
01:10:44.300 --> 01:10:45.380
<v Speaker 2>That's what it's like with weed.</v>

2335
01:10:45.470 --> 01:10:47.180
<v Speaker 2>The other people getting high literally get you high,</v>

2336
01:10:47.181 --> 01:10:48.150
<v Speaker 2>like secondhand highs.</v>

2337
01:10:48.170 --> 01:10:49.190
<v Speaker 2>Real is it?</v>

2338
01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:49.520
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2339
01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:50.300
<v Speaker 2>I always wondered,</v>

2340
01:10:50.300 --> 01:10:52.940
<v Speaker 2>cause I swear to God I read something once where they said no,</v>

2341
01:10:52.941 --> 01:10:54.530
<v Speaker 2>once it's in your mouth,</v>

2342
01:10:54.860 --> 01:10:58.700
<v Speaker 2>it's totally everything that you're blowing out is absorbed,</v>

2343
01:10:58.860 --> 01:10:59.360
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2344
01:10:59.360 --> 01:11:00.193
<v Speaker 2>from weed.</v>

2345
01:11:00.260 --> 01:11:00.800
<v Speaker 2>That's not true.</v>

2346
01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:01.280
<v Speaker 2>It's not.</v>

2347
01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:01.641
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2348
01:11:01.641 --> 01:11:02.780
<v Speaker 2>definitely not that.</v>

2349
01:11:02.781 --> 01:11:03.021
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2350
01:11:03.021 --> 01:11:04.970
<v Speaker 2>it's proof positive that God damn Toronto Room.</v>

2351
01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:05.211
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2352
01:11:05.211 --> 01:11:05.721
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

2353
01:11:05.721 --> 01:11:07.430
<v Speaker 2>That's the only reason I believe it.</v>

2354
01:11:07.580 --> 01:11:11.620
<v Speaker 2>The people have gone up that were stone cold sober and they got hot box and that</v>

2355
01:11:11.630 --> 01:11:13.010
<v Speaker 2>Toronto Room people been in his,</v>

2356
01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:14.340
<v Speaker 2>this podcast studio</v>

2357
01:11:14.340 --> 01:11:15.173
<v Speaker 1>and got hotbox.</v>

2358
01:11:15.180 --> 01:11:16.680
<v Speaker 1>I think [inaudible] got hot box.</v>

2359
01:11:16.920 --> 01:11:17.753
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure.</v>

2360
01:11:17.790 --> 01:11:19.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure if Greg got hotbox too.</v>

2361
01:11:20.310 --> 01:11:20.521
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2362
01:11:20.521 --> 01:11:22.720
<v Speaker 1>You get hotbox to hotbox is real.</v>

2363
01:11:22.860 --> 01:11:24.250
<v Speaker 1>Anybody that says nodded you.</v>

2364
01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:25.680
<v Speaker 1>You haven't done any tests.</v>

2365
01:11:26.010 --> 01:11:26.790
<v Speaker 1>They're liars.</v>

2366
01:11:26.790 --> 01:11:28.440
<v Speaker 1>We always used to clam bake growing up.</v>

2367
01:11:28.470 --> 01:11:29.460
<v Speaker 1>We believed it growing up.</v>

2368
01:11:29.850 --> 01:11:31.590
<v Speaker 1>I think Ed Mcmahon was ass drunk.</v>

2369
01:11:31.860 --> 01:11:35.730
<v Speaker 1>Jake Elrich senior on the tonight show with Johnny Carson play this.</v>

2370
01:11:36.580 --> 01:11:39.300
<v Speaker 1>We hear these guys talking back then look at Johnny.</v>

2371
01:11:39.390 --> 01:11:40.223
<v Speaker 14>The amendment.</v>

2372
01:11:41.190 --> 01:11:45.690
<v Speaker 14>Look at this and there some time ago was a book put out by United States and</v>

2373
01:11:45.691 --> 01:11:46.524
<v Speaker 14>Canada.</v>

2374
01:11:46.770 --> 01:11:47.780
<v Speaker 14>Most all of the book,</v>

2375
01:11:48.140 --> 01:11:53.140
<v Speaker 14>both smoking and with the committee hearing Rehab and it was only one chapter in</v>

2376
01:11:55.051 --> 01:11:58.920
<v Speaker 14>the book was worth considering and then was way he said</v>

2377
01:12:00.380 --> 01:12:03.080
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

2378
01:12:04.170 --> 01:12:06.330
<v Speaker 14>right under the fifth amendment.</v>

2379
01:12:08.520 --> 01:12:13.520
<v Speaker 14>The Fifth Amendment is not good law if we are to be called criminals because we</v>

2380
01:12:14.191 --> 01:12:18.030
<v Speaker 14>use it and then let you take it out of the constitution.</v>

2381
01:12:18.031 --> 01:12:18.870
<v Speaker 14>Let's get rid of it.</v>

2382
01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:20.010
<v Speaker 14>What's the Fifth Amendment?</v>

2383
01:12:20.340 --> 01:12:23.010
<v Speaker 14>Recall history of the reading of history right there.</v>

2384
01:12:23.660 --> 01:12:24.321
<v Speaker 1>Any guesses?</v>

2385
01:12:24.321 --> 01:12:25.830
<v Speaker 1>Some difficulties with the,</v>

2386
01:12:26.180 --> 01:12:27.720
<v Speaker 1>with Greg</v>

2387
01:12:29.260 --> 01:12:31.660
<v Speaker 1>proceedings where they fall down,</v>

2388
01:12:31.820 --> 01:12:36.820
<v Speaker 1>no person shall be held to answer for a capital or otherwise infamous crime and</v>

2389
01:12:37.371 --> 01:12:42.371
<v Speaker 1>less on the present or indictment of a grand jury against them.</v>

2390
01:12:42.950 --> 01:12:44.610
<v Speaker 1>Still that no person,</v>

2391
01:12:45.310 --> 01:12:50.310
<v Speaker 1>a present moment or indictment of a grand jury except in cases are rising in the</v>

2392
01:12:51.771 --> 01:12:53.990
<v Speaker 1>land or naval forces or militia.</v>

2393
01:12:53.991 --> 01:12:54.824
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

2394
01:12:54.930 --> 01:12:57.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure I have a good one.</v>

2395
01:12:58.280 --> 01:13:00.830
<v Speaker 1>Pleading the fifth means you're not supposed to talk,</v>

2396
01:13:00.831 --> 01:13:01.161
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2397
01:13:01.161 --> 01:13:03.200
<v Speaker 1>You plead the fifth you don't have to talk.</v>

2398
01:13:03.770 --> 01:13:04.603
<v Speaker 1>That's what it is.</v>

2399
01:13:04.610 --> 01:13:08.090
<v Speaker 1>It protects the person against being compelled to a witness stand.</v>

2400
01:13:08.720 --> 01:13:09.021
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2401
01:13:09.021 --> 01:13:11.660
<v Speaker 1>Himself or herself in a criminal case.</v>

2402
01:13:11.780 --> 01:13:14.150
<v Speaker 1>How weird is that that we have a law like that?</v>

2403
01:13:14.320 --> 01:13:15.920
<v Speaker 1>Like yeah,</v>

2404
01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:18.020
<v Speaker 1>it was that like if you're a gent,</v>

2405
01:13:18.021 --> 01:13:19.520
<v Speaker 1>non gender specific person.</v>

2406
01:13:20.750 --> 01:13:21.390
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2407
01:13:21.390 --> 01:13:22.250
<v Speaker 1>but he's uh,</v>

2408
01:13:22.280 --> 01:13:23.120
<v Speaker 1>he's still a dude.</v>

2409
01:13:23.120 --> 01:13:23.953
<v Speaker 1>He was banging that check.</v>

2410
01:13:25.460 --> 01:13:26.050
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2411
01:13:26.050 --> 01:13:27.560
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's why she was sticking around.</v>

2412
01:13:27.770 --> 01:13:28.850
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it was a tentacle.</v>

2413
01:13:28.970 --> 01:13:29.990
<v Speaker 1>That's why she came back.</v>

2414
01:13:30.200 --> 01:13:31.490
<v Speaker 1>See if he came back to life again.</v>

2415
01:13:31.880 --> 01:13:32.870
<v Speaker 1>Bring that Dick back.</v>

2416
01:13:33.710 --> 01:13:36.070
<v Speaker 1>I want a social security number for Jeffrey Lash.</v>

2417
01:13:36.920 --> 01:13:38.930
<v Speaker 1>What a weird thing it is that you can say,</v>

2418
01:13:38.931 --> 01:13:41.030
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to testify like Esther,</v>

2419
01:13:41.031 --> 01:13:41.411
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2420
01:13:41.411 --> 01:13:41.660
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2421
01:13:41.660 --> 01:13:45.410
<v Speaker 1>we caught you with a kilo of cocaine and you got a gun and uh,</v>

2422
01:13:45.440 --> 01:13:46.273
<v Speaker 1>how do you plead?</v>

2423
01:13:46.430 --> 01:13:47.270
<v Speaker 1>I plead the fifth.</v>

2424
01:13:47.900 --> 01:13:48.770
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to talk.</v>

2425
01:13:49.130 --> 01:13:49.401
<v Speaker 1>And they,</v>

2426
01:13:49.401 --> 01:13:51.260
<v Speaker 1>then they decide whether or not you're guilty.</v>

2427
01:13:52.780 --> 01:13:54.330
<v Speaker 1>Look at what a great country we live in.</v>

2428
01:13:55.680 --> 01:13:57.680
<v Speaker 1>Just seems a very bizarre,</v>

2429
01:13:58.010 --> 01:14:00.550
<v Speaker 1>that seems very bizarre that you shouldn't have to</v>

2430
01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:05.233
<v Speaker 1>plead the fifth.</v>

2431
01:14:06.550 --> 01:14:09.050
<v Speaker 1>You can because you kind of have the court of your own life.</v>

2432
01:14:09.080 --> 01:14:09.411
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

2433
01:14:09.411 --> 01:14:10.400
<v Speaker 1>it's not going to fly.</v>

2434
01:14:10.670 --> 01:14:11.190
<v Speaker 1>Most people,</v>

2435
01:14:11.190 --> 01:14:11.980
<v Speaker 1>not most people</v>

2436
01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:12.640
<v Speaker 6>are going to go,</v>

2437
01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:15.130
<v Speaker 6>they're going to bang that malate order.</v>

2438
01:14:15.580 --> 01:14:16.450
<v Speaker 6>Ordering the court.</v>

2439
01:14:16.660 --> 01:14:18.400
<v Speaker 6>Who's fucking underwear is this again?</v>

2440
01:14:18.910 --> 01:14:20.200
<v Speaker 6>There's no one put a gun to your head.</v>

2441
01:14:20.410 --> 01:14:21.850
<v Speaker 6>There's no fifth in this house.</v>

2442
01:14:23.350 --> 01:14:23.840
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2443
01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:24.760
<v Speaker 6>plead the fifth.</v>

2444
01:14:25.090 --> 01:14:26.290
<v Speaker 6>That's a weird thing to be able to do.</v>

2445
01:14:26.320 --> 01:14:28.660
<v Speaker 6>Like if you got caught with a dead body,</v>

2446
01:14:29.170 --> 01:14:32.110
<v Speaker 6>you don't have to talk and then they decide whether or not you're guilty.</v>

2447
01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:34.150
<v Speaker 6>Ever really hold up in court course.</v>

2448
01:14:34.160 --> 01:14:35.020
<v Speaker 6>Those fifth,</v>

2449
01:14:35.290 --> 01:14:36.970
<v Speaker 6>fifth a productive</v>

2450
01:14:38.550 --> 01:14:39.383
<v Speaker 6>Dave Chappelle.</v>

2451
01:14:39.460 --> 01:14:39.791
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2452
01:14:39.791 --> 01:14:40.780
<v Speaker 6>It holds up in court.</v>

2453
01:14:41.030 --> 01:14:41.310
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2454
01:14:41.310 --> 01:14:41.740
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

2455
01:14:41.740 --> 01:14:42.071
<v Speaker 6>that's a,</v>

2456
01:14:42.071 --> 01:14:43.630
<v Speaker 6>that's an amendment to the constitution.</v>

2457
01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:45.050
<v Speaker 6>I don't know if they,</v>

2458
01:14:45.051 --> 01:14:46.810
<v Speaker 6>you can be compelled to testify.</v>

2459
01:14:46.811 --> 01:14:47.130
<v Speaker 6>I don't.</v>

2460
01:14:47.130 --> 01:14:47.670
<v Speaker 6>There's a,</v>

2461
01:14:47.670 --> 01:14:50.320
<v Speaker 6>there are times we can be compelled to answer.</v>

2462
01:14:50.321 --> 01:14:50.770
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>

2463
01:14:50.770 --> 01:14:51.160
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

2464
01:14:51.160 --> 01:14:54.520
<v Speaker 6>you can just sit there and say nothing and be put in a whole,</v>

2465
01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:55.540
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

2466
01:14:55.540 --> 01:14:55.961
<v Speaker 6>I guess.</v>

2467
01:14:55.961 --> 01:14:56.291
<v Speaker 6>All right.</v>

2468
01:14:56.291 --> 01:14:58.420
<v Speaker 6>They can't force you to talk Farris who have just written,</v>

2469
01:14:58.421 --> 01:15:00.670
<v Speaker 6>plead the fifth to every question that they've asked.</v>

2470
01:15:00.760 --> 01:15:01.390
<v Speaker 6>I'm sure.</v>

2471
01:15:01.390 --> 01:15:03.400
<v Speaker 6>Well that's why like when should night gets arrested,</v>

2472
01:15:03.401 --> 01:15:04.234
<v Speaker 6>he falls down,</v>

2473
01:15:04.390 --> 01:15:05.200
<v Speaker 6>falls down,</v>

2474
01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:06.340
<v Speaker 6>pretends he's blacking out.</v>

2475
01:15:07.030 --> 01:15:07.870
<v Speaker 6>Like that's what he does.</v>

2476
01:15:07.871 --> 01:15:12.010
<v Speaker 6>Like whenever they like say like he's getting sentenced to bill bales,</v>

2477
01:15:12.011 --> 01:15:15.910
<v Speaker 6>10 million bucks collapses like so they have to take him out of there and then</v>

2478
01:15:15.911 --> 01:15:19.210
<v Speaker 6>they have to take him to the infirmary and they have to breathing hard.</v>

2479
01:15:19.300 --> 01:15:22.380
<v Speaker 6>I think it's better to be in medical care than it is to be in the cell.</v>

2480
01:15:22.381 --> 01:15:23.290
<v Speaker 6>So if you're smart,</v>

2481
01:15:23.710 --> 01:15:24.880
<v Speaker 6>every time they sentence,</v>

2482
01:15:24.881 --> 01:15:27.810
<v Speaker 6>you just fucking have a seizure nose.</v>

2483
01:15:28.690 --> 01:15:29.980
<v Speaker 6>You don't have to even show them.</v>

2484
01:15:30.080 --> 01:15:31.210
<v Speaker 6>Just fall down.</v>

2485
01:15:31.570 --> 01:15:32.381
<v Speaker 6>Just I can't breathe.</v>

2486
01:15:32.381 --> 01:15:33.730
<v Speaker 6>I can't just fall down.</v>

2487
01:15:34.050 --> 01:15:35.470
<v Speaker 6>Just fall down and you just say you're weak.</v>

2488
01:15:35.500 --> 01:15:36.160
<v Speaker 6>I'm blocking out.</v>

2489
01:15:36.160 --> 01:15:37.390
<v Speaker 6>They can't prove you're not blacking out.</v>

2490
01:15:37.660 --> 01:15:40.240
<v Speaker 6>So they have to take you to the doctor and take care of you.</v>

2491
01:15:40.570 --> 01:15:41.240
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

2492
01:15:41.240 --> 01:15:41.620
<v Speaker 6>what did</v>

2493
01:15:41.620 --> 01:15:42.311
<v Speaker 4>great idea.</v>

2494
01:15:42.311 --> 01:15:43.360
<v Speaker 4>I love falling down.</v>

2495
01:15:43.390 --> 01:15:43.841
<v Speaker 4>He's a dude,</v>

2496
01:15:43.841 --> 01:15:44.710
<v Speaker 4>has been around the block,</v>

2497

<v Speaker 4>love falling down.</v>

2498
01:15:47.680 --> 01:15:52.680
<v Speaker 4>I read a book on how to prevent osteoporosis and there's an entire chapter on</v>

2499
01:15:53.170 --> 01:15:54.400
<v Speaker 4>how not to fall down.</v>

2500
01:15:55.490 --> 01:15:55.990
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>

2501
01:15:55.990 --> 01:15:56.590
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2502
01:15:56.590 --> 01:15:58.870
<v Speaker 4>that because US oil,</v>

2503
01:15:58.871 --> 01:15:59.231
<v Speaker 4>they say,</v>

2504
01:15:59.231 --> 01:16:00.010
<v Speaker 4>what's the advice?</v>

2505
01:16:00.010 --> 01:16:02.740
<v Speaker 4>They say a walk slowly and</v>

2506
01:16:06.040 --> 01:16:08.830
<v Speaker 4>your doctor talk to her ass hole.</v>

2507
01:16:10.180 --> 01:16:11.650
<v Speaker 4>Whenever there's handrails,</v>

2508
01:16:11.651 --> 01:16:13.060
<v Speaker 4>hold on to the hand rails.</v>

2509
01:16:13.330 --> 01:16:17.170
<v Speaker 4>And if there's no handrail hold onto the wall or a person.</v>

2510
01:16:18.940 --> 01:16:19.870
<v Speaker 4>Why were you reading this?</v>

2511
01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:22.940
<v Speaker 4>Because I like reading on how to be healthy.</v>

2512
01:16:23.220 --> 01:16:24.230
<v Speaker 4>It's all right.</v>

2513
01:16:24.560 --> 01:16:24.910
<v Speaker 4>I like,</v>

2514
01:16:24.910 --> 01:16:25.390
<v Speaker 4>I like,</v>

2515
01:16:25.390 --> 01:16:27.250
<v Speaker 4>I like being able to prevent the season,</v>

2516
01:16:29.020 --> 01:16:31.900
<v Speaker 5>the idea that it's just like walk slowly.</v>

2517
01:16:31.960 --> 01:16:33.100
<v Speaker 5>Oh okay.</v>

2518
01:16:35.740 --> 01:16:37.000
<v Speaker 5>I was running around and I was</v>

2519
01:16:37.620 --> 01:16:38.310
<v Speaker 4>like if I had,</v>

2520
01:16:38.310 --> 01:16:41.580
<v Speaker 4>if I had a choice between buying a house with stairs and buying a house with no</v>

2521
01:16:41.581 --> 01:16:42.414
<v Speaker 4>stairs,</v>

2522
01:16:42.420 --> 01:16:43.200
<v Speaker 4>I would,</v>

2523
01:16:43.200 --> 01:16:46.530
<v Speaker 4>because I've read that book and because I know that,</v>

2524
01:16:46.710 --> 01:16:47.420
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2525
01:16:47.420 --> 01:16:47.630

2527
01:16:48.750 --> 01:16:49.500
<v Speaker 4>like you know,</v>

2528
01:16:49.500 --> 01:16:52.200
<v Speaker 4>falling down does weaken your bones.</v>

2529
01:16:53.460 --> 01:16:55.330
<v Speaker 5>I would rather buy crest.</v>

2530
01:16:55.530 --> 01:16:55.821
<v Speaker 5>Esther,</v>

2531
01:16:55.821 --> 01:16:57.120
<v Speaker 5>how have you made it so far?</v>

2532
01:16:58.160 --> 01:16:58.921
<v Speaker 5>That's seriously.</v>

2533
01:16:58.921 --> 01:17:00.480
<v Speaker 5>How have you made it this far in life,</v>

2534
01:17:02.020 --> 01:17:02.940
<v Speaker 5>this kind of logic?</v>

2535
01:17:02.941 --> 01:17:03.774
<v Speaker 5>How are you here?</v>

2536
01:17:03.960 --> 01:17:04.800
<v Speaker 5>Fully dressed.</v>

2537
01:17:04.801 --> 01:17:05.634
<v Speaker 5>Fed.</v>

2538
01:17:06.580 --> 01:17:07.510
<v Speaker 5>You have a car?</v>

2539
01:17:09.520 --> 01:17:09.671
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2540
01:17:09.671 --> 01:17:10.504
<v Speaker 5>for real.</v>

2541
01:17:11.030 --> 01:17:11.271
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2542
01:17:11.271 --> 01:17:11.811
<v Speaker 4>for real.</v>

2543
01:17:11.811 --> 01:17:13.580
<v Speaker 4>It makes it wouldn't have stairs.</v>

2544
01:17:13.581 --> 01:17:15.940
<v Speaker 4>I've got it figured I'm going to walk</v>

2545
01:17:18.700 --> 01:17:22.550
<v Speaker 4>away from tall guys because they might have little to the probability of you</v>

2546
01:17:22.551 --> 01:17:26.270
<v Speaker 4>falling if you live in a just a one level house is lower.</v>

2547
01:17:26.300 --> 01:17:27.133
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

2548
01:17:27.140 --> 01:17:27.530
<v Speaker 6>true.</v>

2549
01:17:27.530 --> 01:17:30.530
<v Speaker 6>Cause a lot of times people don't fall downstairs all the time.</v>

2550
01:17:30.531 --> 01:17:31.610
<v Speaker 6>People fall in the kitchen,</v>

2551
01:17:31.611 --> 01:17:32.630
<v Speaker 6>they fall getting out of the tub.</v>

2552
01:17:32.631 --> 01:17:33.464
<v Speaker 6>That's a big one.</v>

2553
01:17:33.510 --> 01:17:34.720
<v Speaker 6>Stairs getting out of town.</v>

2554
01:17:34.730 --> 01:17:36.030
<v Speaker 6>Almost fall in my tub.</v>

2555
01:17:36.031 --> 01:17:37.040
<v Speaker 6>But like every time I get in it</v>

2556
01:17:37.250 --> 01:17:37.460
<v Speaker 4>Mike,</v>

2557
01:17:37.460 --> 01:17:38.070
<v Speaker 4>oh shit.</v>

2558
01:17:38.070 --> 01:17:39.920
<v Speaker 4>I must Darren friend who fell in her tub.</v>

2559
01:17:39.921 --> 01:17:40.880
<v Speaker 4>She broke ribs.</v>

2560
01:17:40.881 --> 01:17:41.714
<v Speaker 4>Shit.</v>

2561
01:17:42.320 --> 01:17:42.690
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2562
01:17:42.690 --> 01:17:45.780
<v Speaker 6>you can get fucked up and breaking ribs is our bomber.</v>

2563
01:17:45.810 --> 01:17:46.950
<v Speaker 6>You ever broken a rib now?</v>

2564
01:17:46.951 --> 01:17:47.850
<v Speaker 6>I haven't broken anything.</v>

2565
01:17:47.970 --> 01:17:48.803
<v Speaker 6>I broke,</v>

2566
01:17:49.020 --> 01:17:52.860
<v Speaker 6>I broke ribs at least at least two times.</v>

2567
01:17:52.950 --> 01:17:53.790
<v Speaker 6>I think more.</v>

2568
01:17:53.970 --> 01:17:55.050
<v Speaker 6>I think I broken a more,</v>

2569
01:17:55.140 --> 01:17:59.010
<v Speaker 6>but I've also broken the cartilage in between the ribs at least six or seven</v>

2570
01:17:59.011 --> 01:17:59.531
<v Speaker 6>times.</v>

2571
01:17:59.531 --> 01:18:00.030
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>

2572
01:18:00.030 --> 01:18:03.600
<v Speaker 6>What mostly martial arts people were punching you?</v>

2573
01:18:03.630 --> 01:18:04.350
<v Speaker 6>Kicking him.</v>

2574
01:18:04.350 --> 01:18:05.490
<v Speaker 6>Kicking you is a big one.</v>

2575
01:18:05.580 --> 01:18:06.180
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>

2576
01:18:06.180 --> 01:18:09.150
<v Speaker 6>The set that what happens is the rebs even if the ribs,</v>

2577
01:18:09.270 --> 01:18:09.841
<v Speaker 6>the ribs,</v>

2578
01:18:09.841 --> 01:18:11.220
<v Speaker 6>even if the ribs don't break,</v>

2579
01:18:11.400 --> 01:18:14.610
<v Speaker 6>what happens is you get kicked really hard and the separate,</v>

2580
01:18:14.970 --> 01:18:15.471
<v Speaker 6>so the,</v>

2581
01:18:15.471 --> 01:18:15.690
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

2582
01:18:15.690 --> 01:18:20.690
<v Speaker 6>the cartilage in between the ribs breaks and so then it pops like when you</v>

2583
01:18:20.941 --> 01:18:21.421
<v Speaker 6>breathe,</v>

2584
01:18:21.421 --> 01:18:25.170
<v Speaker 6>you could feel it moving and you have to wait till that bitch stops moving and</v>

2585
01:18:25.171 --> 01:18:26.370
<v Speaker 6>you have to wait till it to heal up.</v>

2586
01:18:26.370 --> 01:18:29.370
<v Speaker 6>So it's months and months and months where you can do anything when you smoke</v>

2587
01:18:29.371 --> 01:18:30.204
<v Speaker 6>weed.</v>

2588
01:18:30.300 --> 01:18:31.590
<v Speaker 6>This is before I was smoking weed.</v>

2589
01:18:31.640 --> 01:18:32.270
<v Speaker 6>Oh.</v>

2590
01:18:32.270 --> 01:18:32.700
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>

2591
01:18:32.700 --> 01:18:35.940
<v Speaker 6>but I would imagine you could smoke weed but it's going to fucking hurt anytime</v>

2592
01:18:35.941 --> 01:18:36.361
<v Speaker 6>you do that,</v>

2593
01:18:36.361 --> 01:18:36.931
<v Speaker 6>it's going to hurt.</v>

2594
01:18:36.931 --> 01:18:38.910
<v Speaker 6>Like anything we expand that same aisle,</v>

2595
01:18:38.911 --> 01:18:39.390
<v Speaker 6>ribs,</v>

2596
01:18:39.390 --> 01:18:40.650
<v Speaker 6>any movement.</v>

2597
01:18:40.860 --> 01:18:42.930
<v Speaker 6>Like that was a thing like Josie Aldo,</v>

2598
01:18:43.090 --> 01:18:46.410
<v Speaker 6>one of the UFC fighters had a pullout of his title five cause he got a broken</v>

2599
01:18:46.411 --> 01:18:47.190
<v Speaker 6>rib.</v>

2600
01:18:47.190 --> 01:18:48.000
<v Speaker 6>And uh,</v>

2601
01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:48.511
<v Speaker 6>they were saying,</v>

2602
01:18:48.511 --> 01:18:50.640
<v Speaker 6>well he's going to try to rest and try to heal up,</v>

2603
01:18:50.641 --> 01:18:51.690
<v Speaker 6>but you can't even,</v>

2604
01:18:52.080 --> 01:18:53.070
<v Speaker 6>you can't even exercise.</v>

2605
01:18:53.071 --> 01:18:54.030
<v Speaker 6>Like he would gain weight.</v>

2606
01:18:54.070 --> 01:18:55.380
<v Speaker 6>You'd never be able to make weight.</v>

2607
01:18:55.560 --> 01:18:58.170
<v Speaker 6>You can't do any kind of training and if anybody hits you in that rib again,</v>

2608
01:18:58.200 --> 01:18:59.033
<v Speaker 6>you're fucked.</v>

2609
01:18:59.130 --> 01:18:59.431
<v Speaker 6>Like it's,</v>

2610
01:18:59.431 --> 01:19:00.480
<v Speaker 6>it's super dangerous.</v>

2611
01:19:00.481 --> 01:19:03.420
<v Speaker 6>Like the rib can actually break loose and go into your organs.</v>

2612
01:19:03.690 --> 01:19:07.770
<v Speaker 6>It's like the whole design of that thing is a cage around your internal organs,</v>

2613
01:19:08.100 --> 01:19:09.660
<v Speaker 6>but it's pliable.</v>

2614
01:19:09.770 --> 01:19:13.860
<v Speaker 6>So you rather get paid in the ribs or get a concussion and brighten the ribs all</v>

2615
01:19:13.860 --> 01:19:14.180
<v Speaker 6>day.</v>

2616
01:19:14.180 --> 01:19:14.820
<v Speaker 6>100%.</v>

2617
01:19:14.820 --> 01:19:15.270
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2618
01:19:15.270 --> 01:19:15.870
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2619
01:19:15.870 --> 01:19:16.081
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>

2620
01:19:16.081 --> 01:19:17.340
<v Speaker 6>I would rather have the pain.</v>

2621
01:19:17.760 --> 01:19:19.560
<v Speaker 6>The pain of getting a broken rib.</v>

2622
01:19:19.590 --> 01:19:19.831
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

2623
01:19:19.831 --> 01:19:21.960
<v Speaker 6>you'd still do damage to your organs and shit,</v>

2624
01:19:21.961 --> 01:19:24.750
<v Speaker 6>but damage to your head is a totally different ballgame.</v>

2625
01:19:25.170 --> 01:19:26.730
<v Speaker 6>Damage to your head is very fucking day.</v>

2626
01:19:26.790 --> 01:19:28.460
<v Speaker 6>I've had damage to my head and no,</v>

2627
01:19:32.140 --> 01:19:33.130
<v Speaker 4>how recently,</v>

2628
01:19:33.400 --> 01:19:34.510
<v Speaker 4>right before they show,</v>

2629
01:19:35.820 --> 01:19:36.670
<v Speaker 4>but I can't remember.</v>

2630
01:19:37.740 --> 01:19:38.020
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

2631
01:19:38.020 --> 01:19:41.230
<v Speaker 4>Like a few years ago I had a concussion.</v>

2632
01:19:41.260 --> 01:19:41.621
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>

2633
01:19:41.621 --> 01:19:42.430
<v Speaker 4>What happened?</v>

2634
01:19:42.430 --> 01:19:43.570
<v Speaker 4>I got mugged in New York.</v>

2635
01:19:43.720 --> 01:19:44.370
<v Speaker 4>No Shit.</v>

2636
01:19:44.370 --> 01:19:44.980
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2637
01:19:44.980 --> 01:19:45.813
<v Speaker 4>What happened?</v>

2638
01:19:45.840 --> 01:19:46.241
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2639
01:19:46.241 --> 01:19:50.590
<v Speaker 4>I was walking to a show and I blame this purse that I bought.</v>

2640
01:19:50.920 --> 01:19:55.920
<v Speaker 4>I bought like a vintage beautiful coach purse and that was like my first fancy</v>

2641
01:19:56.351 --> 01:19:56.741
<v Speaker 4>purse,</v>

2642
01:19:56.741 --> 01:19:57.430
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2643
01:19:57.430 --> 01:19:58.870
<v Speaker 4>some walking to his show.</v>

2644
01:19:58.871 --> 01:20:03.460
<v Speaker 4>And I have this purse and all of a sudden I'm just knocked out.</v>

2645
01:20:04.330 --> 01:20:07.770
<v Speaker 4>Like I don't remember what happened and I never saw who hate me,</v>

2646
01:20:07.771 --> 01:20:11.190
<v Speaker 4>but somebody hit me on the head and I was just like on the ground.</v>

2647
01:20:11.290 --> 01:20:12.550
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>

2648
01:20:14.010 --> 01:20:14.460
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

2649
01:20:14.460 --> 01:20:17.610
<v Speaker 4>it was in Bushwick on like near the grand street.</v>

2650
01:20:17.670 --> 01:20:18.503
<v Speaker 4>L Stop.</v>

2651
01:20:18.810 --> 01:20:19.420
<v Speaker 4>What is Bush?</v>

2652
01:20:19.420 --> 01:20:21.180
<v Speaker 4>That Brooklyn is Brooklyn and yeah,</v>

2653
01:20:21.181 --> 01:20:22.990
<v Speaker 4>it's like past Williamsburg.</v>

2654
01:20:24.520 --> 01:20:25.353
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2655
01:20:25.860 --> 01:20:26.800
<v Speaker 4>It's like where are all these?</v>

2656
01:20:26.801 --> 01:20:29.070
<v Speaker 4>Like artists are building lofts and you know,</v>

2657
01:20:29.100 --> 01:20:30.380
<v Speaker 4>because it has studios.</v>

2658
01:20:30.390 --> 01:20:30.661
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2659
01:20:30.661 --> 01:20:32.580
<v Speaker 4>And there's a bunch of art studios and stuff there,</v>

2660
01:20:32.860 --> 01:20:34.560
<v Speaker 4>but it's still like,</v>

2661
01:20:34.920 --> 01:20:35.251
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2662
01:20:35.251 --> 01:20:36.240
<v Speaker 4>a tough neighborhood.</v>

2663
01:20:36.360 --> 01:20:40.200
<v Speaker 4>So there was like nobody on the street because it was like a Sunday at like 6:00</v>

2664
01:20:40.200 --> 01:20:41.033
<v Speaker 4>PM or something.</v>

2665
01:20:41.520 --> 01:20:43.140
<v Speaker 4>And so you have no idea what happened?</v>

2666
01:20:43.470 --> 01:20:43.681
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2667
01:20:43.681 --> 01:20:45.480
<v Speaker 4>I never saw you call the police.</v>

2668
01:20:46.170 --> 01:20:46.411
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2669
01:20:46.411 --> 01:20:51.411
<v Speaker 4>I woke up in some lady's apartment and the police were already there and it was</v>

2670
01:20:51.841 --> 01:20:55.560
<v Speaker 4>like a super seventies apartment and I was like looking at them,</v>

2671
01:20:55.670 --> 01:20:56.580
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know where I,</v>

2672
01:20:56.640 --> 01:20:57.151
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>

2673
01:20:57.151 --> 01:20:59.310
<v Speaker 4>It was like my first time blacking out.</v>

2674
01:20:59.670 --> 01:21:01.800
<v Speaker 4>So I just like was looking at them like,</v>

2675
01:21:01.850 --> 01:21:02.440
<v Speaker 4>who are you?</v>

2676
01:21:02.440 --> 01:21:03.060
<v Speaker 4>Why,</v>

2677
01:21:03.060 --> 01:21:03.750
<v Speaker 4>what am I doing?</v>

2678
01:21:03.750 --> 01:21:05.370
<v Speaker 4>Like I felt like I was in the twilight zone.</v>

2679
01:21:05.830 --> 01:21:06.663
<v Speaker 4>Where did you get hit?</v>

2680
01:21:06.670 --> 01:21:07.470
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

2681
01:21:07.470 --> 01:21:08.160
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2682
01:21:08.160 --> 01:21:09.240
<v Speaker 4>I had a black eye,</v>

2683
01:21:09.241 --> 01:21:11.400
<v Speaker 4>so probably like up here somewhere.</v>

2684
01:21:12.120 --> 01:21:12.690
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

2685
01:21:12.690 --> 01:21:13.380
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2686
01:21:13.380 --> 01:21:14.213
<v Speaker 4>Nobody saw it.</v>

2687
01:21:14.760 --> 01:21:15.450
<v Speaker 4>Nobody saw it.</v>

2688
01:21:15.450 --> 01:21:18.030
<v Speaker 4>This lady heard me scream and called the cops.</v>

2689
01:21:18.390 --> 01:21:19.223
<v Speaker 4>She screamed.</v>

2690
01:21:19.410 --> 01:21:20.041
<v Speaker 4>I screamed.</v>

2691
01:21:20.041 --> 01:21:20.520
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2692
01:21:20.520 --> 01:21:21.353
<v Speaker 4>Huh.</v>

2693
01:21:21.870 --> 01:21:23.890
<v Speaker 4>And they ran off and my purse was still there.</v>

2694
01:21:25.120 --> 01:21:25.650
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2695
01:21:25.650 --> 01:21:28.350
<v Speaker 4>he got scared probably cause I screamed really loud.</v>

2696
01:21:29.070 --> 01:21:29.640
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2697
01:21:29.640 --> 01:21:30.900
<v Speaker 4>So you don't remember screaming?</v>

2698
01:21:30.910 --> 01:21:31.800
<v Speaker 4>You don't remember anything?</v>

2699
01:21:31.801 --> 01:21:32.280
<v Speaker 4>You don't know?</v>

2700
01:21:32.280 --> 01:21:33.450
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember screaming.</v>

2701
01:21:34.320 --> 01:21:38.310
<v Speaker 4>You must have been probably fighting with them to try to keep your purse and</v>

2702
01:21:38.311 --> 01:21:41.850
<v Speaker 4>then you got hit because if he got knocked out you wouldn't feel a scream after</v>

2703
01:21:41.851 --> 01:21:42.684
<v Speaker 4>you got knocked out.</v>

2704
01:21:42.780 --> 01:21:43.613
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2705
01:21:44.040 --> 01:21:44.760
<v Speaker 4>Maybe,</v>

2706
01:21:44.760 --> 01:21:46.110
<v Speaker 4>but I don't remember anything.</v>

2707
01:21:46.300 --> 01:21:46.890
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

2708
01:21:46.890 --> 01:21:47.370
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2709
01:21:47.370 --> 01:21:48.060
<v Speaker 4>That's fucked.</v>

2710
01:21:48.060 --> 01:21:48.930
<v Speaker 4>When did this happen?</v>

2711
01:21:49.410 --> 01:21:50.243
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2712
01:21:50.370 --> 01:21:52.980
<v Speaker 4>like maybe four or five years ago.</v>

2713
01:21:52.981 --> 01:21:53.740
<v Speaker 4>Five years ago.</v>

2714
01:21:53.740 --> 01:21:57.410
<v Speaker 4>So God damn scary to someone over a purse.</v>

2715
01:21:58.230 --> 01:21:58.471
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2716
01:21:58.471 --> 01:21:59.790
<v Speaker 4>I'm assuming it was a purse,</v>

2717
01:21:59.791 --> 01:22:00.241
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2718
01:22:00.241 --> 01:22:01.380
<v Speaker 4>but who knows what they,</v>

2719
01:22:02.760 --> 01:22:03.600

<v Speaker 6>not talk to people.</v>

2865
01:25:37.060 --> 01:25:38.310
<v Speaker 6>Don't do an after six months.</v>

2866
01:25:38.311 --> 01:25:40.000
<v Speaker 6>They said you can get a pet chicken.</v>

2867
01:25:40.510 --> 01:25:42.670
<v Speaker 6>Don't get a cat or a dog cause her to interactive</v>

2868
01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:45.740
<v Speaker 4>like literally like the day,</v>

2869
01:25:45.741 --> 01:25:47.250
<v Speaker 4>like her brain's sewn.</v>

2870
01:25:47.540 --> 01:25:48.680
<v Speaker 4>Dogs are supposed to help.</v>

2871
01:25:48.681 --> 01:25:49.100
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

2872
01:25:49.100 --> 01:25:49.820
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2873
01:25:49.820 --> 01:25:50.750

2874
01:25:51.350 --> 01:25:53.060
<v Speaker 4>The dog shitting all over your carpet.</v>

2875
01:25:53.061 --> 01:25:53.630
<v Speaker 4>You've got a headache.</v>

2876
01:25:53.630 --> 01:25:54.463
<v Speaker 4>You like cheese,</v>

2877

<v Speaker 4>somebody's taking care of the dog.</v>

2878
01:25:56.890 --> 01:25:57.400
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2879
01:25:57.400 --> 01:25:59.410
<v Speaker 6>You'd have to have someone like doing everything,</v>

2880
01:25:59.440 --> 01:26:00.580
<v Speaker 6>cleaning after the dog,</v>

2881
01:26:00.790 --> 01:26:01.550
<v Speaker 6>all that jazz.</v>

2882
01:26:01.550 --> 01:26:02.383
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>

2883
01:26:04.700 --> 01:26:06.750
<v Speaker 4>I met a woman at one of my shows in Brooklyn.</v>

2884
01:26:06.780 --> 01:26:10.520
<v Speaker 4>She had no hands or feet.</v>

2885
01:26:10.730 --> 01:26:11.563
<v Speaker 4>What happened to her?</v>

2886
01:26:11.720 --> 01:26:12.140
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2887
01:26:12.140 --> 01:26:16.640
<v Speaker 4>she came up to me after the show and she like wanted to like give me a hug.</v>

2888
01:26:16.641 --> 01:26:16.911
<v Speaker 4>She was like,</v>

2889
01:26:16.911 --> 01:26:17.840
<v Speaker 4>you're so funny.</v>

2890
01:26:18.200 --> 01:26:20.030
<v Speaker 4>And she had like these stubs and she said,</v>

2891
01:26:20.060 --> 01:26:23.360
<v Speaker 4>you remind me of the girls who did my nails when I had hands.</v>

2892
01:26:26.120 --> 01:26:26.960
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>

2893
01:26:27.140 --> 01:26:27.973
<v Speaker 4>whoa.</v>

2894
01:26:28.410 --> 01:26:29.240
<v Speaker 4>Then like</v>

2895
01:26:29.240 --> 01:26:29.671
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

2896
01:26:29.671 --> 01:26:33.160
<v Speaker 1>why so much to take table was like racism,</v>

2897
01:26:36.260 --> 01:26:37.093
<v Speaker 1>Korea,</v>

2898
01:26:37.250 --> 01:26:38.083
<v Speaker 1>Vietnamese,</v>

2899
01:26:38.720 --> 01:26:39.640
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck?</v>

2900
01:26:39.641 --> 01:26:40.474
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2901
01:26:40.730 --> 01:26:41.563
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

2902
01:26:42.110 --> 01:26:46.160
<v Speaker 4>I was thinking like I want to bring it up if I just met her any other way.</v>

2903
01:26:46.280 --> 01:26:46.580
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2904
01:26:46.580 --> 01:26:49.280
<v Speaker 4>But since she brought up her hands,</v>

2905
01:26:49.310 --> 01:26:49.761
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

2906
01:26:49.761 --> 01:26:51.710
<v Speaker 4>what happened to your hands?</v>

2907
01:26:52.460 --> 01:26:54.700
<v Speaker 4>And she said that she had um,</v>

2908
01:26:54.710 --> 01:26:59.630
<v Speaker 4>something wrong with her appendix went to the hospital and the doctor put the</v>

2909
01:26:59.631 --> 01:27:00.464
<v Speaker 4>wrong name,</v>

2910
01:27:01.180 --> 01:27:05.690
<v Speaker 4>like mixed up her charts and they amputated her hands and her feet</v>

2911
01:27:07.520 --> 01:27:11.360
<v Speaker 4>when she was only supposed to get her appendix taken out or something.</v>

2912
01:27:11.390 --> 01:27:12.223
<v Speaker 4>Very minor.</v>

2913
01:27:15.010 --> 01:27:15.843
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2914
01:27:16.990 --> 01:27:20.050
<v Speaker 4>And then a few weeks after that comedy show where I met her,</v>

2915
01:27:20.260 --> 01:27:22.450
<v Speaker 4>I saw on the front page of the paper in New York,</v>

2916
01:27:22.451 --> 01:27:23.960
<v Speaker 4>it said so and so so-and-so,</v>

2917
01:27:23.961 --> 01:27:24.761
<v Speaker 4>whatever her name was,</v>

2918
01:27:24.761 --> 01:27:25.594
<v Speaker 4>I forgot her name.</v>

2919
01:27:25.710 --> 01:27:26.260
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2920
01:27:26.260 --> 01:27:27.940
<v Speaker 4>given $14 million or whatever,</v>

2921
01:27:27.941 --> 01:27:28.211
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2922
01:27:28.211 --> 01:27:30.370
<v Speaker 4>like the settlement for your hands and your feet.</v>

2923
01:27:30.400 --> 01:27:31.570
<v Speaker 4>I forget how much it was,</v>

2924
01:27:31.571 --> 01:27:34.590
<v Speaker 4>but no hand jobs maybe longer.</v>

2925
01:27:34.840 --> 01:27:36.570
<v Speaker 4>And I met her boyfriend.</v>

2926
01:27:37.310 --> 01:27:40.920
<v Speaker 1>All can imagine dating that happening to your girlfriend and you're like,</v>

2927
01:27:40.950 --> 01:27:41.131
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

2928
01:27:41.131 --> 01:27:41.341
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2929
01:27:41.341 --> 01:27:42.200
<v Speaker 1>I'll stick around with it.</v>

2930
01:27:42.220 --> 01:27:43.053
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2931
01:27:45.380 --> 01:27:45.891
<v Speaker 4>I asked him,</v>

2932
01:27:45.891 --> 01:27:46.191
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>

2933
01:27:46.191 --> 01:27:48.170
<v Speaker 4>how long have you guys been together?</v>

2934
01:27:48.410 --> 01:27:51.590
<v Speaker 4>He was like a year when that happened.</v>

2935
01:27:51.950 --> 01:27:52.640
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

2936
01:27:52.640 --> 01:27:53.031
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

2937
01:27:53.031 --> 01:27:53.541
<v Speaker 4>well I'm man,</v>

2938
01:27:53.541 --> 01:27:54.950
<v Speaker 4>you're such a good guy.</v>

2939
01:27:55.310 --> 01:27:55.611
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2940
01:27:55.611 --> 01:27:57.500
<v Speaker 4>she can't even like wipe her ass</v>

2941
01:27:57.800 --> 01:28:00.710
<v Speaker 1>or maybe he went to the fucking hospital and switch to put things on here.</v>

2942
01:28:00.740 --> 01:28:02.340
<v Speaker 1>She is the founder.</v>

2943
01:28:04.190 --> 01:28:05.200
<v Speaker 12>All right there.</v>

2944
01:28:06.870 --> 01:28:09.600
<v Speaker 4>But you know why she was so,</v>

2945
01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:10.980
<v Speaker 4>let's just so bizarre.</v>

2946
01:28:11.010 --> 01:28:13.020
<v Speaker 4>She was so happy that like,</v>

2947
01:28:13.770 --> 01:28:14.603
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2948
01:28:14.880 --> 01:28:17.990
<v Speaker 4>you wonder like how that,</v>

2949
01:28:18.270 --> 01:28:19.290
<v Speaker 4>how she can be happy.</v>

2950
01:28:19.320 --> 01:28:21.180
<v Speaker 4>But she was so like,</v>

2951
01:28:21.570 --> 01:28:22.860
<v Speaker 4>she was in such a good mood.</v>

2952
01:28:22.861 --> 01:28:24.810
<v Speaker 4>Like she was just like loving the comedy show.</v>

2953
01:28:24.811 --> 01:28:27.630
<v Speaker 4>She was so appreciative and like she was having a great time.</v>

2954
01:28:28.160 --> 01:28:28.710
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

2955
01:28:28.710 --> 01:28:30.810
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>

2956
01:28:31.290 --> 01:28:31.801
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2957
01:28:31.801 --> 01:28:34.620
<v Speaker 4>there's no reason that anybody should have to commit suicide.</v>

2958
01:28:34.621 --> 01:28:35.454
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

2959
01:28:35.610 --> 01:28:35.881
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2960
01:28:35.881 --> 01:28:38.070
<v Speaker 4>this woman doesn't even have hands and she's happy.</v>

2961
01:28:39.180 --> 01:28:40.860
<v Speaker 1>I see your point in that regard.</v>

2962
01:28:40.861 --> 01:28:43.530
<v Speaker 1>But I think people commit suicide because of mental issues.</v>

2963
01:28:43.590 --> 01:28:44.850
<v Speaker 1>I think that the mind,</v>

2964
01:28:45.030 --> 01:28:46.950
<v Speaker 1>the depression that people go through,</v>

2965
01:28:46.951 --> 01:28:49.830
<v Speaker 1>some people go through some fucking unbearable depression.</v>

2966
01:28:50.090 --> 01:28:50.730
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

2967
01:28:50.730 --> 01:28:51.810
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand it.</v>

2968
01:28:51.811 --> 01:28:52.644
<v Speaker 1>I don't know it.</v>

2969
01:28:53.160 --> 01:28:57.690
<v Speaker 1>But I know people have gone through it and there's something that happens to the</v>

2970
01:28:57.691 --> 01:29:00.870
<v Speaker 1>human mind when the serotonin dopamine levels are,</v>

2971
01:29:01.260 --> 01:29:02.250
<v Speaker 1>or you just don't</v>

2972
01:29:02.250 --> 01:29:03.180
<v Speaker 6>want to be alive.</v>

2973
01:29:03.210 --> 01:29:04.980
<v Speaker 6>You just would rather shut the lights off.</v>

2974
01:29:05.580 --> 01:29:06.180
<v Speaker 6>I get it.</v>

2975
01:29:06.180 --> 01:29:08.610
<v Speaker 4>And once you think that you don't want to be alive,</v>

2976
01:29:08.640 --> 01:29:12.270
<v Speaker 4>that just takes over and everything's just doomed from then on.</v>

2977
01:29:12.300 --> 01:29:12.421
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2978
01:29:12.421 --> 01:29:15.720
<v Speaker 4>My friends going through it right now and I was trying to talk to him the other</v>

2979
01:29:15.720 --> 01:29:16.740
<v Speaker 4>day and it's just like you can't,</v>

2980
01:29:16.890 --> 01:29:17.940
<v Speaker 4>no matter what you say,</v>

2981
01:29:17.970 --> 01:29:22.410
<v Speaker 4>it's not going to change his mind of how horrible everything is in its place.</v>

2982
01:29:22.490 --> 01:29:25.140
<v Speaker 4>That you could just like show them pictures of like happier times.</v>

2983
01:29:25.141 --> 01:29:27.170
<v Speaker 4>Like remember when we went to the waterpark,</v>

2984
01:29:27.190 --> 01:29:27.490
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

2985
01:29:27.490 --> 01:29:30.480
<v Speaker 4>And haven't worked and have it work or you know,</v>

2986
01:29:30.481 --> 01:29:31.830
<v Speaker 4>show them memories of like,</v>

2987
01:29:32.430 --> 01:29:34.530
<v Speaker 4>you wish you could just show them videos of,</v>

2988
01:29:35.190 --> 01:29:35.461
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2989
01:29:35.461 --> 01:29:37.080
<v Speaker 4>happier times that they've had.</v>

2990
01:29:37.200 --> 01:29:37.381
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2991
01:29:37.381 --> 01:29:38.550
<v Speaker 6>There's so many variables too.</v>

2992
01:29:38.551 --> 01:29:39.210
<v Speaker 6>There's like,</v>

2993
01:29:39.210 --> 01:29:42.270
<v Speaker 6>your life could be sucky and there's no end in sight.</v>

2994
01:29:42.271 --> 01:29:43.650
<v Speaker 6>There's no light at the end of the tunnel.</v>

2995
01:29:43.651 --> 01:29:48.651
<v Speaker 6>Or it could be chemical and your life is Saki or it could be a series of sad</v>

2996
01:29:48.691 --> 01:29:53.490
<v Speaker 6>things that have happened to you and failures or losing jobs or you know,</v>

2997
01:29:53.491 --> 01:29:55.680
<v Speaker 6>being depressed and unemployable or,</v>

2998
01:29:55.700 --> 01:29:55.890
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2999
01:29:55.890 --> 01:29:57.840
<v Speaker 6>there's a lot of things that people just do,</v>

3000
01:29:58.190 --> 01:30:01.710
<v Speaker 6>a series of events take place and then they reach a point where they feel like</v>

3001
01:30:01.711 --> 01:30:04.100
<v Speaker 6>it's never gonna get any better and they just don't want to play anymore.</v>

3002
01:30:04.110 --> 01:30:05.220
<v Speaker 6>They just don't want to do it anymore.</v>

3003
01:30:05.610 --> 01:30:09.030
<v Speaker 4>There's a comedian who saved a guy jumping off the bridge,</v>

3004
01:30:09.210 --> 01:30:10.380
<v Speaker 4>the George Washington bridge,</v>

3005
01:30:10.590 --> 01:30:11.880
<v Speaker 4>like a huge comedian.</v>

3006
01:30:11.881 --> 01:30:13.050
<v Speaker 4>He like held him,</v>

3007
01:30:13.500 --> 01:30:14.161
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God,</v>

3008
01:30:14.161 --> 01:30:17.700
<v Speaker 4>for like hours or something goes really wrong.</v>

3009
01:30:18.150 --> 01:30:18.811
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't,</v>

3010
01:30:18.811 --> 01:30:19.980
<v Speaker 4>I don't think you could hold him for hours,</v>

3011
01:30:20.050 --> 01:30:21.540
<v Speaker 4>but maybe not for hours,</v>

3012
01:30:21.541 --> 01:30:23.850
<v Speaker 4>but he was like a complete hero that day.</v>

3013
01:30:24.860 --> 01:30:27.010
<v Speaker 4>Totally got jumped the next day was stupid.</v>

3014
01:30:27.040 --> 01:30:28.960
<v Speaker 4>I'm doing right.</v>

3015
01:30:29.130 --> 01:30:30.210
<v Speaker 4>How's your arm sore?</v>

3016
01:30:32.480 --> 01:30:34.880
<v Speaker 6>There's people that does don't want to be here anymore.</v>

3017
01:30:36.050 --> 01:30:37.280
<v Speaker 6>They're going to die eventually.</v>

3018
01:30:37.790 --> 01:30:38.151
<v Speaker 6>You know?</v>

3019
01:30:38.151 --> 01:30:39.260
<v Speaker 6>That's what's really fucked up.</v>

3020
01:30:39.290 --> 01:30:40.580
<v Speaker 6>It's like we want them to stay alive.</v>

3021
01:30:40.581 --> 01:30:41.361
<v Speaker 6>We want to save them,</v>

3022
01:30:41.361 --> 01:30:45.710
<v Speaker 6>but we also know that this is a temporary ride and they're hating this ride.</v>

3023
01:30:45.740 --> 01:30:46.760
<v Speaker 6>This ride sucks for them.</v>

3024
01:30:46.790 --> 01:30:47.360
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3025
01:30:47.360 --> 01:30:48.890
<v Speaker 6>And so it's hard to tell them,</v>

3026
01:30:48.891 --> 01:30:49.431
<v Speaker 6>hey man,</v>

3027
01:30:49.431 --> 01:30:50.720
<v Speaker 6>stick around for what?</v>

3028
01:30:51.020 --> 01:30:54.560
<v Speaker 6>What am I sticking around for so they can keep doing this for another 30 years</v>

3029
01:30:54.710 --> 01:30:55.543
<v Speaker 6>and then what?</v>

3030
01:30:55.850 --> 01:30:56.683
<v Speaker 6>And then it's over.</v>

3031
01:30:57.460 --> 01:30:59.130
<v Speaker 4>They going to talk to,</v>

3032
01:30:59.470 --> 01:30:59.731
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3033
01:30:59.731 --> 01:31:02.940
<v Speaker 4>people just like people have become hermits and they don't want to leave their</v>

3034
01:31:02.941 --> 01:31:03.860
<v Speaker 4>house and you know,</v>

3035
01:31:04.230 --> 01:31:08.760
<v Speaker 4>like our society allows it to happen because like the way it's built nowadays</v>

3036
01:31:08.761 --> 01:31:10.170
<v Speaker 4>with so many conveniences,</v>

3037
01:31:10.171 --> 01:31:11.820
<v Speaker 4>like you could just get food delivered,</v>

3038
01:31:11.821 --> 01:31:13.500
<v Speaker 4>you can get anything delivered to your house.</v>

3039
01:31:13.530 --> 01:31:17.400
<v Speaker 4>I had all of Guardian and you don't have a reason to like leave your house and</v>

3040
01:31:17.401 --> 01:31:19.320
<v Speaker 4>you could just let it pile up and become a mess.</v>

3041
01:31:19.970 --> 01:31:20.600
<v Speaker 6>Livers.</v>

3042
01:31:20.600 --> 01:31:20.811
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

3043
01:31:20.811 --> 01:31:22.160
<v Speaker 6>but there's apps now like she said,</v>

<v Speaker 6>like we'll deliver anything.</v>

3045
01:31:23.031 --> 01:31:23.330
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>

3046
01:31:23.330 --> 01:31:23.840
<v Speaker 6>oh yeah,</v>

3047
01:31:23.840 --> 01:31:24.501
<v Speaker 6>go through the APP,</v>

3048
01:31:24.501 --> 01:31:26.390
<v Speaker 6>order it in like 40 minutes.</v>

3049
01:31:26.500 --> 01:31:30.250
<v Speaker 4>I had all of you could just be addicted to internet porn and just never leave</v>

3050
01:31:30.251 --> 01:31:30.761
<v Speaker 4>your house.</v>

3051
01:31:30.761 --> 01:31:30.830
<v Speaker 4>Let's</v>

3052
01:31:30.830 --> 01:31:31.611
<v Speaker 6>do that as well.</v>

3053
01:31:31.611 --> 01:31:32.810
<v Speaker 6>There's a lot of people that do that.</v>

3054
01:31:33.080 --> 01:31:34.710
<v Speaker 6>There's a guy that I know that a,</v>

3055
01:31:34.730 --> 01:31:37.760
<v Speaker 6>he's like a professor I'm going to get him on eventually,</v>

3056
01:31:37.761 --> 01:31:40.670
<v Speaker 6>but he thinks there's nothing wrong with being addicted to porn.</v>

3057
01:31:41.030 --> 01:31:44.180
<v Speaker 6>He said the way he equates as being addicted to porn is like being addicted to</v>

3058
01:31:44.181 --> 01:31:47.840
<v Speaker 6>sports or being addicted to games or playing videos.</v>

3059
01:31:47.900 --> 01:31:48.531
<v Speaker 6>Like he's like,</v>

3060
01:31:48.531 --> 01:31:49.180
<v Speaker 6>it's just you're,</v>

3061
01:31:49.180 --> 01:31:50.180
<v Speaker 6>you're enjoying something.</v>

3062
01:31:50.390 --> 01:31:53.900
<v Speaker 6>Like everybody has this bad idea in their head that like the obsession about</v>

3063
01:31:53.901 --> 01:31:56.510
<v Speaker 6>porn is so awful.</v>

3064
01:31:56.750 --> 01:31:59.740
<v Speaker 6>Whereas like the obsession about video games just</v>

3065
01:31:59.980 --> 01:32:02.560
<v Speaker 2>at the most unfortunate or you know,</v>

3066
01:32:02.561 --> 01:32:05.980
<v Speaker 2>a waste of time and had sex with a real life human being in years.</v>

3067
01:32:06.070 --> 01:32:06.903
<v Speaker 2>How do you know?</v>

3068
01:32:07.150 --> 01:32:08.650
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I think he's just a professor.</v>

3069
01:32:08.860 --> 01:32:09.850
<v Speaker 2>I'm not necessarily think,</v>

3070
01:32:09.851 --> 01:32:11.530
<v Speaker 2>I don't necessarily think he's talking about himself.</v>

3071
01:32:11.560 --> 01:32:12.510
<v Speaker 2>I think he's trying to make</v>

3072
01:32:12.640 --> 01:32:17.640
<v Speaker 6>some sort of a rational argument for why we have this unusual attitude about sex</v>

3073
01:32:18.261 --> 01:32:19.670
<v Speaker 6>that we don't apply to everything else.</v>

3074
01:32:19.671 --> 01:32:19.821
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

3075
01:32:19.821 --> 01:32:21.620
<v Speaker 6>if someone really loves cars,</v>

3076
01:32:21.621 --> 01:32:25.490
<v Speaker 6>like say if you're like a guy like loves vintage cars and you just want like</v>

3077
01:32:25.491 --> 01:32:25.820
<v Speaker 6>there's,</v>

3078
01:32:25.820 --> 01:32:26.361
<v Speaker 6>there's people,</v>

3079
01:32:26.361 --> 01:32:27.620
<v Speaker 6>like I looked at this house,</v>

3080
01:32:27.840 --> 01:32:28.170
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3081
01:32:28.170 --> 01:32:32.810
<v Speaker 6>that was for sale on there was in the Pacific northwest and it was the guy was a</v>

3082
01:32:32.811 --> 01:32:34.580
<v Speaker 6>Ferrari fan.</v>

3083
01:32:34.610 --> 01:32:35.990
<v Speaker 6>Like you love Ferrari's,</v>

3084
01:32:36.200 --> 01:32:37.880
<v Speaker 6>so you had Ferrari design,</v>

3085
01:32:37.881 --> 01:32:38.750
<v Speaker 6>his kitchen,</v>

3086
01:32:39.020 --> 01:32:40.580
<v Speaker 6>he's like got a Ferrari kitchen.</v>

3087
01:32:40.581 --> 01:32:45.581
<v Speaker 6>And then he had a glass wall from his living room to this enormous garage that</v>

3088
01:32:45.891 --> 01:32:47.420
<v Speaker 6>was filled with Ferrari's.</v>

3089
01:32:47.660 --> 01:32:49.570
<v Speaker 6>And this guy was just obsessed with Ferrari.</v>

3090
01:32:49.571 --> 01:32:49.790
<v Speaker 6>He's,</v>

3091
01:32:49.790 --> 01:32:54.170
<v Speaker 6>he's just a rich guy who loved and he had old ones and he had new ones and he</v>

3092
01:32:54.171 --> 01:32:57.230
<v Speaker 6>had like vintage ones and this guy was just obsessed.</v>

3093
01:32:57.380 --> 01:32:59.330
<v Speaker 6>He had Ferrari books and magazines.</v>

3094
01:32:59.900 --> 01:33:00.980
<v Speaker 6>But if that was porn,</v>

3095
01:33:00.981 --> 01:33:02.240
<v Speaker 6>you'd think he's a creep.</v>

3096
01:33:02.390 --> 01:33:02.750
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

3097
01:33:02.750 --> 01:33:03.230
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

3098
01:33:03.230 --> 01:33:03.970
<v Speaker 6>if it's cars,</v>

3099
01:33:03.970 --> 01:33:04.321
<v Speaker 6>like wow,</v>

3100
01:33:04.321 --> 01:33:05.690
<v Speaker 6>he's got a fucking loves Ferraris,</v>

3101
01:33:05.780 --> 01:33:06.680
<v Speaker 6>you don't get it.</v>

3102
01:33:06.710 --> 01:33:07.310
<v Speaker 6>But he is,</v>

3103
01:33:07.310 --> 01:33:08.210
<v Speaker 6>you don't judge them.</v>

3104
01:33:08.240 --> 01:33:08.511
<v Speaker 6>You Go,</v>

3105
01:33:08.511 --> 01:33:10.610
<v Speaker 6>well I guess he just really likes Ferrari's,</v>

3106
01:33:10.820 --> 01:33:11.241
<v Speaker 6>whatever.</v>

3107
01:33:11.241 --> 01:33:11.781
<v Speaker 6>He's got money,</v>

3108
01:33:11.781 --> 01:33:12.530
<v Speaker 6>who cares?</v>

3109
01:33:12.530 --> 01:33:15.650
<v Speaker 6>But if you went over his house and it's all just blow up dolls and dildos</v>

3110
01:33:15.700 --> 01:33:16.120
<v Speaker 2>so far.</v>

3111
01:33:16.120 --> 01:33:16.740
<v Speaker 2>She's house.</v>

3112
01:33:16.740 --> 01:33:17.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3113
01:33:18.880 --> 01:33:20.020
<v Speaker 2>it is judge his house.</v>

3114
01:33:20.080 --> 01:33:20.381
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

3115
01:33:20.381 --> 01:33:21.400
<v Speaker 2>if you need a place to stay,</v>

3116
01:33:21.401 --> 01:33:22.234
<v Speaker 2>let me know.</v>

3117
01:33:22.240 --> 01:33:22.991
<v Speaker 2>Do you get pregnant?</v>

3118
01:33:22.991 --> 01:33:24.740
<v Speaker 2>Just walking through the door and you know she's placed,</v>

3119
01:33:25.400 --> 01:33:26.091
<v Speaker 6>but you know what I'm saying?</v>

3120
01:33:26.091 --> 01:33:26.691
<v Speaker 6>It's like why?</v>

3121
01:33:26.691 --> 01:33:27.590
<v Speaker 6>Why do we get,</v>

3122
01:33:27.800 --> 01:33:32.540
<v Speaker 6>I think it's because we have weird attitudes about sex and we also have the</v>

3123
01:33:32.541 --> 01:33:33.950
<v Speaker 6>attitude that porn,</v>

3124
01:33:33.951 --> 01:33:37.400
<v Speaker 6>at least some of it dehumanizes women like porn.</v>

3125
01:33:37.401 --> 01:33:40.730
<v Speaker 6>At least some of it makes you look at women like they're an object and not an</v>

3126
01:33:40.731 --> 01:33:41.121
<v Speaker 6>equal,</v>

3127
01:33:41.121 --> 01:33:41.721
<v Speaker 6>not a person.</v>

3128
01:33:41.721 --> 01:33:42.620
<v Speaker 6>Just something to fuck.</v>

3129
01:33:43.530 --> 01:33:47.640
<v Speaker 2>That's why they have a hard time meeting a real live woman because they've been</v>

3130
01:33:47.700 --> 01:33:48.990
<v Speaker 2>desensitized to it so much.</v>

3131
01:33:48.991 --> 01:33:50.190
<v Speaker 2>They want to treat a woman like that.</v>

3132
01:33:50.191 --> 01:33:51.150
<v Speaker 2>The minute they meet her,</v>

3133
01:33:51.540 --> 01:33:51.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3134
01:33:51.890 --> 01:33:52.330
<v Speaker 2>have time.</v>

3135
01:33:52.330 --> 01:33:53.220
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't like,</v>

3136
01:33:53.250 --> 01:33:55.860
<v Speaker 2>they don't have the time to get to know you.</v>

3137
01:33:55.861 --> 01:33:57.460
<v Speaker 2>They don't have the patience to get to.</v>

3138
01:33:57.470 --> 01:33:59.580
<v Speaker 2>They're just like sitting there on a date probably thinking,</v>

3139
01:33:59.581 --> 01:34:01.890
<v Speaker 2>why isn't she taking her clothes off and licking my balls?</v>

3140
01:34:01.920 --> 01:34:02.753
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

3141
01:34:02.930 --> 01:34:04.170
<v Speaker 2>That's what everybody thinks by the way.</v>

3142
01:34:06.660 --> 01:34:07.950
<v Speaker 2>They just keep it to themselves.</v>

3143
01:34:08.550 --> 01:34:09.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3144
01:34:09.180 --> 01:34:09.930
<v Speaker 2>definitely.</v>

3145
01:34:09.930 --> 01:34:10.410
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3146
01:34:10.410 --> 01:34:11.730
<v Speaker 2>those scenarios too.</v>

3147
01:34:11.731 --> 01:34:13.740
<v Speaker 2>It's just like what we were talking about earlier,</v>

3148
01:34:13.800 --> 01:34:18.330
<v Speaker 2>kind of any scenario that you depict in a movie that become like the lion king</v>

3149
01:34:18.331 --> 01:34:19.710
<v Speaker 2>or Cimbar and that shit,</v>

3150
01:34:20.010 --> 01:34:21.750
<v Speaker 2>it becomes the Yogi bear.</v>

3151
01:34:21.780 --> 01:34:23.970
<v Speaker 2>It becomes like how you start thinking of bears.</v>

3152
01:34:24.360 --> 01:34:24.511
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3153
01:34:24.511 --> 01:34:28.550
<v Speaker 2>if you watched too many movies where girls just call a plumber and starts</v>

3154
01:34:28.551 --> 01:34:29.384
<v Speaker 2>sucking his Dick,</v>

3155
01:34:29.850 --> 01:34:34.140
<v Speaker 2>you just assume that this is how people operate and behave the same way.</v>

3156
01:34:34.140 --> 01:34:37.860
<v Speaker 2>You assume Yogi bear is going to try to take your picnic basket and not eat your</v>

3157
01:34:37.861 --> 01:34:38.610
<v Speaker 2>kids.</v>

3158
01:34:38.610 --> 01:34:39.240
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3159
01:34:39.240 --> 01:34:43.560
<v Speaker 2>we have these weird images in our head because of the media and porn.</v>

3160
01:34:43.860 --> 01:34:45.960
<v Speaker 2>As much as it doesn't seem like it's the media.</v>

3161
01:34:46.170 --> 01:34:46.921
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

3162
01:34:46.921 --> 01:34:49.260
<v Speaker 2>100% is it's you're watching,</v>

3163
01:34:49.270 --> 01:34:51.360
<v Speaker 2>my college boyfriend was addicted to porn.</v>

3164
01:34:51.510 --> 01:34:51.721
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

3165
01:34:51.721 --> 01:34:53.430
<v Speaker 2>I think that because um,</v>

3166
01:34:53.610 --> 01:34:57.030
<v Speaker 2>I thought his name was John for the longest time and then everybody,</v>

3167
01:34:57.140 --> 01:34:58.190
<v Speaker 2>his dorm floor was like,</v>

3168
01:34:58.191 --> 01:34:58.401

01:35:00.230 --> 01:35:00.741
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

3171
01:35:00.741 --> 01:35:02.240
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck is Bordeaux John?</v>

3172
01:35:02.270 --> 01:35:02.481
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

3173
01:35:02.481 --> 01:35:04.050
<v Speaker 2>well there's two Johns on her floor.</v>

3174
01:35:05.570 --> 01:35:06.520
<v Speaker 2>These porno John.</v>

3175
01:35:06.560 --> 01:35:09.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah cause he like porno cause he was like,</v>

3176
01:35:09.440 --> 01:35:12.500
<v Speaker 2>he had the most porn out of everybody on his floor.</v>

3177
01:35:12.590 --> 01:35:14.300
<v Speaker 2>Maybe he's just really good at collecting shit.</v>

3178
01:35:14.930 --> 01:35:15.763
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3179
01:35:15.780 --> 01:35:16.630
<v Speaker 2>I hope so.</v>

3180
01:35:18.800 --> 01:35:20.060
<v Speaker 2>I hope so now.</v>

3181
01:35:20.061 --> 01:35:20.894
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3182
01:35:21.870 --> 01:35:22.490
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3183
01:35:22.490 --> 01:35:23.540
<v Speaker 2>he was like regular.</v>

3184
01:35:23.541 --> 01:35:24.860
<v Speaker 2>I was freaking than him.</v>

3185
01:35:25.300 --> 01:35:26.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3186
01:35:27.320 --> 01:35:28.250
<v Speaker 2>because like,</v>

3187
01:35:28.400 --> 01:35:28.880
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>

3188
01:35:28.880 --> 01:35:33.680
<v Speaker 2>I think when you're young you just like sometimes have sex and you don't care</v>

3189
01:35:33.681 --> 01:35:35.150
<v Speaker 2>about the other people's feelings.</v>

3190
01:35:35.460 --> 01:35:36.293
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3191
01:35:41.980 --> 01:35:46.310
<v Speaker 2>after he came I would keep going and he would be like,</v>

3192
01:35:46.400 --> 01:35:47.660
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to do my homework.</v>

3193
01:35:47.990 --> 01:35:48.823
<v Speaker 2>Do you mind?</v>

3194
01:35:52.100 --> 01:35:53.180
<v Speaker 2>You need to find a better dude.</v>

3195
01:35:53.990 --> 01:35:55.310
<v Speaker 2>That's what every guy wants.</v>

3196
01:35:55.311 --> 01:35:56.121
<v Speaker 2>Every guy wants to grow,</v>

3197
01:35:56.121 --> 01:35:57.170
<v Speaker 2>wants to have sex all the time.</v>

3198
01:35:57.500 --> 01:35:59.180
<v Speaker 2>So he wasn't that much of a freak.</v>

3199
01:35:59.181 --> 01:36:00.860
<v Speaker 2>They named him Porno John,</v>

3200
01:36:00.861 --> 01:36:02.750
<v Speaker 2>but it could be</v>

3201
01:36:05.600 --> 01:36:07.600
<v Speaker 2>eaten off like crazy white</v>

3202
01:36:09.620 --> 01:36:10.220
<v Speaker 2>woman.</v>

3203
01:36:10.220 --> 01:36:11.060
<v Speaker 2>Then once he came on,</v>

3204
01:36:11.061 --> 01:36:12.110
<v Speaker 2>so I'm done.</v>

3205
01:36:12.111 --> 01:36:13.040
<v Speaker 2>I'm fucking exhausted.</v>

3206
01:36:13.160 --> 01:36:15.260
<v Speaker 2>Cause he already ran five marathons that day,</v>

3207
01:36:15.660 --> 01:36:15.890
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

3208
01:36:15.890 --> 01:36:19.910
<v Speaker 2>So running up a flight of stairs was exhausting for a normal person running up a</v>

3209
01:36:19.911 --> 01:36:21.410
<v Speaker 2>flight of stairs is pretty commonplace.</v>

3210
01:36:21.460 --> 01:36:22.293
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3211
01:36:22.570 --> 01:36:23.403
<v Speaker 2>Porno John,</v>

3212
01:36:23.700 --> 01:36:26.210
<v Speaker 2>he just been beaten off into a couple day</v>

3213
01:36:32.580 --> 01:36:33.413
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

3214
01:36:34.220 --> 01:36:36.440
<v Speaker 2>So why would you care if he watched porn?</v>

3215
01:36:38.810 --> 01:36:39.810
<v Speaker 2>Brainwashed by all these</v>

3216
01:36:41.450 --> 01:36:44.780
<v Speaker 2>romantic comedies or magazines or whatever.</v>

3217
01:36:44.840 --> 01:36:49.040
<v Speaker 2>Do Romantic comedies get mad if they're romantic comedies where a woman gets mad</v>

3218
01:36:49.041 --> 01:36:50.300
<v Speaker 2>if a guy's using porn?</v>

3219
01:36:50.330 --> 01:36:50.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3220
01:36:50.900 --> 01:36:52.900
<v Speaker 2>except some of the hipper ones.</v>

3221
01:36:55.010 --> 01:37:00.010
<v Speaker 2>Like if he's watching porn that he must not want me and I would like</v>

3222
01:37:06.970 --> 01:37:07.860
<v Speaker 2>fun to watch.</v>

3223
01:37:09.780 --> 01:37:11.980
<v Speaker 2>I don't care if he watches girls get mad at you.</v>

3224
01:37:12.380 --> 01:37:12.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3225
01:37:12.600 --> 01:37:13.211
<v Speaker 2>Like she,</v>

3226
01:37:13.211 --> 01:37:13.770
<v Speaker 2>she would get,</v>

3227
01:37:13.770 --> 01:37:18.180
<v Speaker 2>I had girls get mad at me that if I followed porn people on Instagram,</v>

3228
01:37:18.181 --> 01:37:19.620
<v Speaker 2>Twitter to the point of like,</v>

3229
01:37:19.621 --> 01:37:21.960
<v Speaker 2>why I'm not doing it for you type thing.</v>

3230
01:37:21.961 --> 01:37:26.961
<v Speaker 2>Like it got so bad where I wasn't allowed to do porn or even have photos of</v>

3231
01:37:27.480 --> 01:37:30.630
<v Speaker 2>women I as wallpapers or anything like that.</v>

3232
01:37:30.750 --> 01:37:33.590
<v Speaker 2>I think when I was younger I was taught to like think that it's,</v>

3233
01:37:33.750 --> 01:37:34.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3234
01:37:34.350 --> 01:37:36.630
<v Speaker 2>you're just supposed to take it personal if personally,</v>

3235
01:37:36.631 --> 01:37:37.464
<v Speaker 2>if you don't,</v>

3236
01:37:37.500 --> 01:37:38.580
<v Speaker 2>if he's watching porn,</v>

3237
01:37:38.581 --> 01:37:38.760
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

3238
01:37:38.760 --> 01:37:40.410
<v Speaker 2>you must not be enough or something,</v>

3239
01:37:40.500 --> 01:37:40.811
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3240
01:37:40.811 --> 01:37:45.210
<v Speaker 2>from your friends or was it from probably from growing up in the Midwest.</v>

3241
01:37:45.480 --> 01:37:46.140
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

3242
01:37:46.140 --> 01:37:50.430
<v Speaker 2>Chicago sort of morals like Chicago is still the Midwest,</v>

3243
01:37:50.431 --> 01:37:51.690
<v Speaker 2>even though it's a big city,</v>

3244
01:37:51.750 --> 01:37:52.380
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

3245
01:37:52.380 --> 01:37:56.400
<v Speaker 2>it's still like frowned upon</v>

3246
01:37:56.400 --> 01:37:58.020
<v Speaker 4>crazy behavior,</v>

3247
01:37:58.120 --> 01:37:58.740
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

3248
01:37:58.740 --> 01:37:59.251
<v Speaker 4>So I was like,</v>

3249
01:37:59.251 --> 01:38:00.300
<v Speaker 4>let me get out of here.</v>

3250
01:38:00.390 --> 01:38:01.223
<v Speaker 4>You guys suck.</v>

3251
01:38:01.770 --> 01:38:02.790
<v Speaker 2>I love Chicago.</v>

3252
01:38:02.850 --> 01:38:03.810
<v Speaker 2>But I see what you're saying.</v>

3253
01:38:03.870 --> 01:38:05.820
<v Speaker 2>I think those spots in the middle of the country,</v>

3254
01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:06.181
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3255
01:38:06.181 --> 01:38:06.930
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of,</v>

3256
01:38:06.930 --> 01:38:10.230
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of hold overthinking a certain of change though,</v>

3257
01:38:10.231 --> 01:38:10.680
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>

3258
01:38:10.680 --> 01:38:12.330
<v Speaker 2>This is trying to change all across the country.</v>

3259
01:38:12.510 --> 01:38:14.160
<v Speaker 2>People becoming more and more openminded.</v>

3260
01:38:14.190 --> 01:38:15.060
<v Speaker 2>Wouldn't you imagine that?</v>

3261
01:38:15.090 --> 01:38:15.271
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3262
01:38:15.271 --> 01:38:16.210
<v Speaker 2>when I moved here Joe,</v>

3263
01:38:16.620 --> 01:38:19.950
<v Speaker 2>like you would talk about masturbating all the time and I remember one time</v>

3264
01:38:19.951 --> 01:38:21.120
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about how you were math,</v>

3265
01:38:21.150 --> 01:38:22.890
<v Speaker 2>you masturbated the other day to something.</v>

3266
01:38:22.891 --> 01:38:23.540
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

3267
01:38:23.540 --> 01:38:25.560
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe he's telling me this right now.</v>

3268
01:38:25.740 --> 01:38:26.640
<v Speaker 2>I hope loud.</v>

3269
01:38:26.641 --> 01:38:27.810
<v Speaker 2>Like I was so like,</v>

3270
01:38:27.840 --> 01:38:29.270
<v Speaker 2>like shy about it matters.</v>

3271
01:38:29.280 --> 01:38:30.330
<v Speaker 2>Not Him like recently,</v>

3272
01:38:30.610 --> 01:38:30.810
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3273
01:38:30.810 --> 01:38:32.040
<v Speaker 2>this is like 13 years ago.</v>

3274
01:38:32.850 --> 01:38:34.740
<v Speaker 2>He started working for me about 13 years ago ago.</v>

3275
01:38:34.770 --> 01:38:35.603
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3276
01:38:35.610 --> 01:38:35.851
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3277
01:38:35.851 --> 01:38:36.684
<v Speaker 2>That's cool.</v>

3278
01:38:36.950 --> 01:38:38.550
<v Speaker 2>But that's how it changed.</v>

3279
01:38:38.580 --> 01:38:39.840
<v Speaker 2>It is in the Midwest though.</v>

3280
01:38:39.870 --> 01:38:41.850
<v Speaker 2>Like talking about poop out loud.</v>

3281
01:38:42.120 --> 01:38:42.930
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3282
01:38:42.930 --> 01:38:46.830
<v Speaker 2>that's why Brian seems childlike because really he's experiencing this for the</v>

3283
01:38:46.831 --> 01:38:47.230
<v Speaker 2>first time.</v>

3284
01:38:47.230 --> 01:38:47.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3285
01:38:47.610 --> 01:38:48.720
<v Speaker 2>Whereas like most people,</v>

3286
01:38:49.530 --> 01:38:50.363
<v Speaker 2>by the time,</v>

<v Speaker 1>They can make a name for themselves.</v>

3489
01:43:26.121 --> 01:43:26.931
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

01:46:24.290 --> 01:46:26.960
<v Speaker 6>he was fucking vicious.</v>

3600
01:46:27.440 --> 01:46:27.890
<v Speaker 6>Oh.</v>

3601

3602
01:46:31.071 --> 01:46:32.530
<v Speaker 6>but it was poor girl.</v>

3603
01:46:33.200 --> 01:46:34.040
<v Speaker 6>It was ruthless.</v>

3604
01:46:34.041 --> 01:46:34.940
<v Speaker 6>So she tried,</v>

3605
01:46:35.030 --> 01:46:35.631
<v Speaker 6>she tried,</v>

3606

<v Speaker 6>she went after him and she got him with some good ones too,</v>

3607
01:46:38.210 --> 01:46:39.920
<v Speaker 6>but he had some nuclear weapons.</v>

3608
01:46:39.921 --> 01:46:40.641
<v Speaker 6>It was fucked up.</v>

3609
01:46:40.641 --> 01:46:44.840
<v Speaker 6>It was like she pulled out some big cannons and fucked him up and then he just</v>

3610
01:46:44.841 --> 01:46:49.110
<v Speaker 6>dropped nuclear bombs and leveled the landscape to the point where people were</v>

3611
01:46:49.111 --> 01:46:50.700
<v Speaker 6>falling out of chairs.</v>

3612
01:46:50.880 --> 01:46:54.750
<v Speaker 6>I was curled up in the fetal position on the two chairs and then the Negro wave</v>

3613
01:46:54.900 --> 01:46:55.061
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

3617
01:46:59.970 --> 01:47:01.080
<v Speaker 6>You don't have to be in la.</v>

3618
01:47:01.260 --> 01:47:03.810

<v Speaker 6>the Negro wave jumps up and they scream.</v>

3624
01:47:12.971 --> 01:47:14.660
<v Speaker 6>And that was a Jamal who the dude,</v>

3625
01:47:14.661 --> 01:47:15.570
<v Speaker 6>he poured water on himself.</v>

<v Speaker 6>He climbs up on chairs and he's grinding in people's faces and it's all just</v>

3632
01:47:30.031 --> 01:47:31.260
<v Speaker 6>because this joke was,</v>

01:49:33.630 --> 01:49:33.950
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3718
01:49:33.950 --> 01:49:35.380
<v Speaker 6>Just nothing wrong with being together.</v>

3719
01:49:35.381 --> 01:49:39.340
<v Speaker 6>But here's the thing about the marriage that's really goofy is the legal</v>

3720
01:49:39.341 --> 01:49:43.450
<v Speaker 6>contract aspect of it to bring in other people and signing paperwork and stuff.</v>

3721
01:49:43.950 --> 01:49:44.350
<v Speaker 6>Just like,</v>

3722
01:49:44.350 --> 01:49:46.810
<v Speaker 2>but how can you like stamp that on,</v>

3723
01:49:47.230 --> 01:49:47.711
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3724
01:49:47.711 --> 01:49:47.980
<v Speaker 2>it's</v>

3725
01:49:47.980 --> 01:49:48.221
<v Speaker 6>just,</v>

3726
01:49:48.221 --> 01:49:51.550
<v Speaker 6>so the only way it makes sense to me is when you have children,</v>

3727
01:49:51.670 --> 01:49:54.610
<v Speaker 6>you have children and the wife doesn't want to get stuck with no money.</v>

3728
01:49:54.640 --> 01:49:55.960
<v Speaker 6>I have a friend who's married,</v>

3729
01:49:56.080 --> 01:49:58.000
<v Speaker 6>who's not married and is pregnant,</v>

3730
01:49:58.090 --> 01:50:02.380
<v Speaker 6>and I know that baby is going to grow up in a loving home with two parents.</v>

3731
01:50:02.410 --> 01:50:03.160
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

3732
01:50:03.160 --> 01:50:05.770
<v Speaker 6>like you don't have to get married to have kids in that scenario.</v>

3733
01:50:05.771 --> 01:50:06.670
<v Speaker 6>I hope you correct,</v>

3734
01:50:07.020 --> 01:50:10.060
<v Speaker 6>but I think for a lot of women they want like legal protection.</v>

3735
01:50:10.061 --> 01:50:13.110
<v Speaker 6>They want to be able to like be able to get money out support,</v>

3736
01:50:13.570 --> 01:50:14.530
<v Speaker 6>not just child support,</v>

3737
01:50:14.531 --> 01:50:15.311
<v Speaker 6>but even alimony,</v>

3738
01:50:15.311 --> 01:50:16.690
<v Speaker 6>be able to pay for themselves too.</v>

3739
01:50:17.110 --> 01:50:18.290
<v Speaker 6>If they've been living their life,</v>

3740
01:50:18.580 --> 01:50:22.840
<v Speaker 6>being taken care of the child and made some sort of a mutual Deon and the dude</v>

3741
01:50:22.841 --> 01:50:24.100
<v Speaker 6>just decides a fucking jet.</v>

3742
01:50:24.280 --> 01:50:24.910
<v Speaker 6>Listen Bitch,</v>

3743
01:50:24.910 --> 01:50:25.743
<v Speaker 6>I moved to Jamaica,</v>

3744
01:50:26.650 --> 01:50:27.640
<v Speaker 6>wanted to get married.</v>

3745
01:50:28.270 --> 01:50:30.760
<v Speaker 6>It just seems like you're just tied down.</v>

3746
01:50:31.060 --> 01:50:33.040
<v Speaker 6>Well that's why they made divorce.</v>

3747
01:50:34.060 --> 01:50:35.080
<v Speaker 6>But you aren't tied down.</v>

3748
01:50:35.081 --> 01:50:36.550
<v Speaker 6>I mean that's exactly what it is.</v>

3749
01:50:36.551 --> 01:50:37.690
<v Speaker 6>It's a legal contract.</v>

3750
01:50:37.691 --> 01:50:38.200
<v Speaker 6>It's crazy.</v>

3751
01:50:38.200 --> 01:50:39.130
<v Speaker 6>The only thing that makes sense,</v>

3752
01:50:39.131 --> 01:50:39.491
<v Speaker 6>like I said,</v>

3753
01:50:39.491 --> 01:50:41.110
<v Speaker 6>the only time it makes sense if you have children,</v>

3754
01:50:41.230 --> 01:50:42.390
<v Speaker 6>this is coming from someone's happy.</v>

3755
01:50:42.400 --> 01:50:43.680
<v Speaker 6>He marries a green card.</v>

3756
01:50:44.200 --> 01:50:45.520
<v Speaker 6>That's a good move for it too.</v>

3757
01:50:45.521 --> 01:50:46.510
<v Speaker 6>I know people who've done that.</v>

3758
01:50:46.511 --> 01:50:47.344
<v Speaker 6>That's a good move.</v>

3759
01:50:47.410 --> 01:50:47.950
<v Speaker 6>I get that.</v>

3760
01:50:47.950 --> 01:50:52.000
<v Speaker 6>Make $15,000 but if you have children I can get,</v>

3761
01:50:52.001 --> 01:50:57.001
<v Speaker 6>I can understand why a woman would want some sort of a legally binding sort of</v>

3762
01:50:57.070 --> 01:51:00.520
<v Speaker 6>some sort of a insurance that she's going to be getting money from this guy that</v>

3763
01:51:00.880 --> 01:51:02.470
<v Speaker 6>she had babies with.</v>

3764
01:51:02.560 --> 01:51:03.400
<v Speaker 6>That makes sense to me.</v>

3765
01:51:03.880 --> 01:51:08.020
<v Speaker 6>You know what drives me crazy though is the non baby alimony.</v>

3766
01:51:08.200 --> 01:51:08.370
<v Speaker 6>My,</v>

3767
01:51:08.370 --> 01:51:10.600
<v Speaker 6>you don't have babies and you have to pay forever.</v>

3768
01:51:10.870 --> 01:51:13.720
<v Speaker 6>Like I have a buddy who was married for more than 12 years and if you know a</v>

3769
01:51:13.721 --> 01:51:14.620
<v Speaker 6>California works,</v>

3770
01:51:14.890 --> 01:51:16.000
<v Speaker 6>but California works,</v>

3771
01:51:16.001 --> 01:51:16.241
<v Speaker 6>if he,</v>

3772
01:51:16.241 --> 01:51:17.680
<v Speaker 6>if it goes over a certain amount of years,</v>

3773
01:51:17.681 --> 01:51:20.270
<v Speaker 6>I think it's like 12 you have to pay alimony forever,</v>

3774
01:51:20.580 --> 01:51:21.210
<v Speaker 6>forever,</v>

3775
01:51:21.210 --> 01:51:21.790
<v Speaker 6>forever,</v>

3776
01:51:21.790 --> 01:51:22.271
<v Speaker 6>forever,</v>

3777
01:51:22.271 --> 01:51:22.980
<v Speaker 6>forever.</v>

3778
01:51:22.980 --> 01:51:23.350
<v Speaker 6>Forever,</v>

3779
01:51:23.350 --> 01:51:23.740
<v Speaker 6>forever.</v>

3780
01:51:23.740 --> 01:51:24.573
<v Speaker 6>Until they die.</v>

3781
01:51:25.020 --> 01:51:25.191
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

3782
01:51:25.191 --> 01:51:26.080
<v Speaker 6>and there's no kids.</v>

3783
01:51:26.170 --> 01:51:27.003
<v Speaker 6>There's no kids.</v>

3784
01:51:27.190 --> 01:51:27.671
<v Speaker 6>Here's my,</v>

3785
01:51:27.671 --> 01:51:29.230
<v Speaker 6>here's my friend's story at common law.</v>

3786
01:51:29.231 --> 01:51:30.064
<v Speaker 6>Married,</v>

3787
01:51:30.070 --> 01:51:30.700
<v Speaker 6>married,</v>

3788
01:51:30.700 --> 01:51:31.121
<v Speaker 6>common law.</v>

3789
01:51:31.121 --> 01:51:32.740
<v Speaker 6>Marriage I believe is a much different,</v>

3790
01:51:33.010 --> 01:51:35.710
<v Speaker 6>I think you could just sue the shit out of somebody if you have a common law</v>

3791
01:51:35.711 --> 01:51:36.101
<v Speaker 6>marriage,</v>

3792
01:51:36.101 --> 01:51:38.650
<v Speaker 6>like have you been living together and they've been supporting you for certain</v>

3793
01:51:38.651 --> 01:51:39.484
<v Speaker 6>amount of time.</v>

3794
01:51:39.520 --> 01:51:40.330
<v Speaker 6>But this is,</v>

3795
01:51:40.330 --> 01:51:43.150
<v Speaker 6>this is my friend's story and this is a very good friend.</v>

3796
01:51:43.151 --> 01:51:45.070
<v Speaker 6>So I know the details of this intimately.</v>

3797
01:51:45.071 --> 01:51:49.060
<v Speaker 6>I've had fucking sweaty conversations with this guy where if I introduced him to</v>

3798
01:51:49.061 --> 01:51:49.894
<v Speaker 6>a Hitman,</v>

3799
01:51:49.990 --> 01:51:51.340
<v Speaker 6>he probably would have taken it.</v>

3800
01:51:51.610 --> 01:51:52.810
<v Speaker 6>He probably would have not really,</v>

3801
01:51:52.811 --> 01:51:53.644
<v Speaker 6>he's not a murderer.</v>

3802
01:51:53.890 --> 01:51:55.090
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to get my friend in trouble.</v>

3803
01:51:55.360 --> 01:52:00.360
<v Speaker 6>But my friend was married to this woman for a long time and the last few years</v>

3804
01:52:01.271 --> 01:52:02.860
<v Speaker 6>it was real rough and he's just like,</v>

3805
01:52:02.861 --> 01:52:04.480
<v Speaker 6>God damn and I can't do this anymore.</v>

3806
01:52:04.481 --> 01:52:05.470
<v Speaker 6>And he doesn't know what to do.</v>

3807
01:52:05.860 --> 01:52:06.520
<v Speaker 6>And then,</v>

3808
01:52:06.520 --> 01:52:06.881
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3809
01:52:06.881 --> 01:52:11.590
<v Speaker 6>one day decided to get out and she was furious and she prolonged the divorce</v>

3810
01:52:11.591 --> 01:52:12.251
<v Speaker 6>forever.</v>

3811
01:52:12.251 --> 01:52:15.790
<v Speaker 6>She tortured him during the divorce because when you don't have a Prenup,</v>

3812
01:52:15.970 --> 01:52:18.070
<v Speaker 6>then you have to argue over each point of the divorce.</v>

3813
01:52:18.250 --> 01:52:18.910
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

3814
01:52:18.910 --> 01:52:21.640
<v Speaker 6>her idea was since it was all his money,</v>

3815
01:52:21.820 --> 01:52:24.430
<v Speaker 6>because she didn't have a job and he was supporting her,</v>

3816
01:52:24.550 --> 01:52:27.550
<v Speaker 6>he had to pay for her lawyer as well as his lawyer.</v>

3817
01:52:27.580 --> 01:52:31.570
<v Speaker 6>I heard some lawyers do it for free knowing that they'll get paid at the end.</v>

3818
01:52:31.690 --> 01:52:31.990
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

3819
01:52:31.990 --> 01:52:34.030
<v Speaker 6>most certainly they would do that,</v>

3820
01:52:34.060 --> 01:52:35.740
<v Speaker 6>but they don't have to do that.</v>

3821
01:52:36.010 --> 01:52:39.970
<v Speaker 6>If the woman is in a scenario where the man pays for everything and she doesn't</v>

3822
01:52:39.971 --> 01:52:40.804
<v Speaker 6>have a job,</v>

3823
01:52:40.840 --> 01:52:43.180
<v Speaker 6>well the man has to pay for her fucking divorce.</v>

3824
01:52:43.360 --> 01:52:47.360
<v Speaker 6>It's like going to war and you have to pay for the other armies general.</v>

3825
01:52:47.430 --> 01:52:51.560
<v Speaker 6>She doesn't have a job and has no income and has been living off of whatever he</v>

3826
01:52:51.561 --> 01:52:52.394
<v Speaker 6>makes.</v>

3827
01:52:52.460 --> 01:52:55.580
<v Speaker 6>How are they supposed to go to court if he doesn't pay for her lawyer?</v>

3828
01:52:55.770 --> 01:52:56.603
<v Speaker 6>Get a fucking job.</v>

3829
01:52:56.660 --> 01:52:56.841
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

3830
01:52:56.841 --> 01:52:57.171
<v Speaker 6>she's done.</v>

3831
01:52:57.171 --> 01:52:57.861
<v Speaker 6>She doesn't have kids.</v>

3832
01:52:57.861 --> 01:52:59.630
<v Speaker 6>There's no reason why she doesn't have a job,</v>

3833
01:52:59.810 --> 01:53:00.081
<v Speaker 6>but he,</v>

3834
01:53:00.081 --> 01:53:01.550
<v Speaker 6>even though he doesn't want to be with her anymore,</v>

3835
01:53:01.551 --> 01:53:03.140
<v Speaker 6>he's legally bound to be with her.</v>

3836
01:53:03.141 --> 01:53:03.590
<v Speaker 6>Okay,</v>

3837
01:53:03.590 --> 01:53:04.790
<v Speaker 6>so he has this,</v>

3838
01:53:04.850 --> 01:53:06.290
<v Speaker 6>this law contract with her,</v>

3839
01:53:06.291 --> 01:53:07.940
<v Speaker 6>this legal marriage contract,</v>

3840
01:53:08.450 --> 01:53:13.450
<v Speaker 6>and it goes on for almost two years where she makes an agreement.</v>

3841
01:53:13.551 --> 01:53:14.040
<v Speaker 6>They,</v>

3842
01:53:14.040 --> 01:53:17.060
<v Speaker 6>they'd come to some sort of agreement and then she drags it out even further.</v>

3843
01:53:17.060 --> 01:53:17.910
<v Speaker 6>She changes the,</v>

3844
01:53:17.920 --> 01:53:19.970
<v Speaker 6>what she wants and she's allowed to do that.</v>

3845
01:53:20.210 --> 01:53:21.050
<v Speaker 6>She's allowed to change it,</v>

3846
01:53:21.051 --> 01:53:21.481
<v Speaker 6>whatever she would,</v>

3847
01:53:21.481 --> 01:53:22.940
<v Speaker 6>she doesn't have to agree to anything.</v>

3848
01:53:23.150 --> 01:53:24.670
<v Speaker 6>So she keeps fighting it as,</v>

3849
01:53:24.750 --> 01:53:26.450
<v Speaker 6>since she's fighting it with his money.</v>

3850
01:53:26.660 --> 01:53:29.980
<v Speaker 6>She's just bullying Yam and bleeding.</v>

3851
01:53:29.981 --> 01:53:30.150
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

3852
01:53:30.150 --> 01:53:31.310
<v Speaker 6>she knows he has a lot of money.</v>

3853
01:53:31.340 --> 01:53:33.200
<v Speaker 6>She knows exactly how much money he makes,</v>

3854
01:53:33.320 --> 01:53:35.780
<v Speaker 6>so she keeps bleeding them over and over and over again.</v>

3855
01:53:35.810 --> 01:53:37.280
<v Speaker 6>She used to do his bookkeeping.</v>

3856
01:53:37.310 --> 01:53:37.640
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

3857
01:53:37.640 --> 01:53:38.420
<v Speaker 6>she didn't do his bookkeeping.</v>

3858
01:53:38.420 --> 01:53:39.650
<v Speaker 6>She's doing a damn thing.</v>

3859
01:53:39.651 --> 01:53:42.200
<v Speaker 6>She walked a little dog around Pacific Palisades.</v>

3860
01:53:42.320 --> 01:53:43.153
<v Speaker 6>That's what she did.</v>

3861
01:53:43.250 --> 01:53:44.180
<v Speaker 6>She didn't do nothing.</v>

3862
01:53:44.240 --> 01:53:47.270
<v Speaker 6>Isn't that where Jeffrey Lash was a yes,</v>

3863
01:53:47.271 --> 01:53:48.140
<v Speaker 6>this woman's an alien.</v>

3864
01:53:48.530 --> 01:53:49.363
<v Speaker 6>Anyway,</v>

3865
01:53:49.640 --> 01:53:50.210
<v Speaker 6>anyway,</v>

3866
01:53:50.210 --> 01:53:54.590
<v Speaker 6>my point is this shit went on for like two years and cost him insane,</v>

3867
01:53:54.620 --> 01:53:56.150
<v Speaker 6>ungodly amounts of money.</v>

3868
01:53:56.330 --> 01:53:58.070
<v Speaker 6>Then after it's all over,</v>

3869
01:53:58.071 --> 01:53:59.030
<v Speaker 6>he lost his house.</v>

3870
01:53:59.120 --> 01:54:01.580
<v Speaker 6>So she lives in this beautiful house.</v>

3871
01:54:01.580 --> 01:54:02.750
<v Speaker 6>It's overlooking the ocean.</v>

3872
01:54:02.751 --> 01:54:02.931
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

3873
01:54:02.931 --> 01:54:04.070
<v Speaker 6>it is fucking stunning.</v>

3874
01:54:04.220 --> 01:54:05.000
<v Speaker 6>It's amazing house.</v>

3875
01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:10.000
<v Speaker 6>And he has to pay her alimony for the rest of her life until she gets married.</v>

3876
01:54:11.660 --> 01:54:13.650
<v Speaker 6>If she gets married or cohabitating with a man.</v>

3877
01:54:13.920 --> 01:54:14.480
<v Speaker 6>Ah,</v>

3878
01:54:14.480 --> 01:54:15.300
<v Speaker 6>but that's where,</v>

3879
01:54:15.300 --> 01:54:16.133
<v Speaker 6>this is where it's crazy.</v>

3880
01:54:16.190 --> 01:54:17.510
<v Speaker 6>So now she has a boyfriend,</v>

3881
01:54:17.780 --> 01:54:19.400
<v Speaker 6>but the boyfriend lives with her.</v>

3882
01:54:19.401 --> 01:54:22.100
<v Speaker 6>Why would he live in his fucking shitty house when they can live with this</v>

3883
01:54:22.101 --> 01:54:24.170
<v Speaker 6>beautiful house overlooking the ocean?</v>

3884
01:54:24.470 --> 01:54:29.470
<v Speaker 6>So the boyfriend moves in and then they sent inspectors over to find out if the</v>

3885
01:54:30.411 --> 01:54:31.610
<v Speaker 6>boyfriend is living there.</v>

3886
01:54:31.700 --> 01:54:33.290
<v Speaker 6>She knows the inspectors are coming.</v>

3887
01:54:33.350 --> 01:54:34.850
<v Speaker 6>So he grabs all this stuff,</v>

3888
01:54:34.880 --> 01:54:36.080
<v Speaker 6>puts in a fucking u haul,</v>

3889
01:54:36.081 --> 01:54:38.780
<v Speaker 6>literally drives a mile away.</v>

3890
01:54:38.930 --> 01:54:40.040
<v Speaker 6>Parks the u haul,</v>

3891
01:54:40.130 --> 01:54:41.710
<v Speaker 6>waits for the inspectors to leave.</v>

3892
01:54:41.840 --> 01:54:42.980
<v Speaker 6>Turns back around,</v>

3893
01:54:43.130 --> 01:54:45.320
<v Speaker 6>reloads all his shit back into the house again,</v>

3894
01:54:46.560 --> 01:54:46.941
<v Speaker 6>because he,</v>

3895
01:54:46.941 --> 01:54:47.270
<v Speaker 6>if,</v>

3896
01:54:47.270 --> 01:54:50.750
<v Speaker 6>if this guy and her married the gravy train stops.</v>

3897
01:54:50.960 --> 01:54:52.810
<v Speaker 6>But if the guy and her are together,</v>

3898
01:54:52.830 --> 01:54:57.830
<v Speaker 6>she gets hundreds of thousands of dollars every year,</v>

3899
01:54:58.040 --> 01:55:00.440
<v Speaker 6>hundreds of thousands of dollars.</v>

3900
01:55:00.740 --> 01:55:02.300
<v Speaker 6>Like she's living up in,</v>

3901
01:55:02.580 --> 01:55:06.500
<v Speaker 6>they went lifestyle with a man that she just used to date.</v>

3902
01:55:06.650 --> 01:55:07.341
<v Speaker 6>She used to date him.</v>

3903
01:55:07.341 --> 01:55:10.610
<v Speaker 6>They haven't been together like romantically in more than a decade.</v>

3904
01:55:10.760 --> 01:55:14.090
<v Speaker 6>But this guy every week is writing fat checks,</v>

3905
01:55:14.210 --> 01:55:17.240
<v Speaker 6>fat fucking checks and sending them off in the mail.</v>

3906
01:55:17.360 --> 01:55:18.080
<v Speaker 6>Hundreds,</v>

3907
01:55:18.080 --> 01:55:19.070
<v Speaker 6>it's driving him mad.</v>

3908
01:55:19.100 --> 01:55:20.450
<v Speaker 6>That's what Trump should run on.</v>

3909
01:55:21.170 --> 01:55:21.351
<v Speaker 6>What?</v>

3910
01:55:21.351 --> 01:55:21.860
<v Speaker 6>Divorce.</v>

3911
01:55:21.860 --> 01:55:22.693
<v Speaker 6>Alimony.</v>

3912
01:55:23.720 --> 01:55:25.220
<v Speaker 6>But it doesn't always work that way.</v>

3913
01:55:25.221 --> 01:55:26.240
<v Speaker 6>It's like this guy just,</v>

3914
01:55:26.241 --> 01:55:29.990
<v Speaker 6>it was a combination of a ruthless woman who knows the system.</v>

3915
01:55:30.200 --> 01:55:33.260
<v Speaker 6>Good lawyers that can manipulate a guy who makes a lot of money.</v>

3916
01:55:33.620 --> 01:55:33.801
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

3917
01:55:33.801 --> 01:55:34.550
<v Speaker 6>there's a lot of,</v>

3918
01:55:34.550 --> 01:55:35.690
<v Speaker 6>a lot of stuff involved in it.</v>

3919
01:55:35.691 --> 01:55:36.524
<v Speaker 6>He should uh,</v>

3920
01:55:36.710 --> 01:55:39.800
<v Speaker 6>hire inspectors are private investigators.</v>

3921
01:55:39.860 --> 01:55:41.390
<v Speaker 6>Get the inspectors to come back,</v>

3922
01:55:41.391 --> 01:55:43.510
<v Speaker 6>have the video of them taking it.</v>

3923
01:55:44.510 --> 01:55:45.343
<v Speaker 6>Not good enough.</v>

3924
01:55:45.390 --> 01:55:46.260
<v Speaker 6>It's not good enough.</v>

3925
01:55:46.410 --> 01:55:46.570
<v Speaker 6>He,</v>

3926
01:55:46.570 --> 01:55:47.400
<v Speaker 6>he could,</v>

3927
01:55:47.400 --> 01:55:49.410
<v Speaker 6>he could leave a certain amount of personal items there.</v>

3928
01:55:49.620 --> 01:55:50.010
<v Speaker 6>The point,</v>

3929
01:55:50.010 --> 01:55:51.460
<v Speaker 6>the point is like he,</v>

3930
01:55:51.580 --> 01:55:52.650
<v Speaker 6>they're manipulating it.</v>

3931
01:55:52.860 --> 01:55:55.770
<v Speaker 6>Like all he has to do is keep an apartment and he'd get of the shittiest</v>

3932
01:55:55.771 --> 01:55:57.450
<v Speaker 6>apartment in Compton and then like,</v>

3933
01:55:57.451 --> 01:55:57.631
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

3934
01:55:57.631 --> 01:55:58.464
<v Speaker 6>this is my place.</v>

3935
01:55:58.500 --> 01:56:01.110
<v Speaker 6>And like stay over her house 99% of the time.</v>

3936
01:56:01.320 --> 01:56:02.071
<v Speaker 6>Just go over his house,</v>

3937
01:56:02.071 --> 01:56:04.920
<v Speaker 6>take a shit and leave and force them to get married.</v>

3938
01:56:04.950 --> 01:56:05.400
<v Speaker 6>Nope.</v>

3939
01:56:05.400 --> 01:56:07.020
<v Speaker 6>All they can't get on your knees.</v>

3940
01:56:07.350 --> 01:56:08.880
<v Speaker 6>Bitch proposed right now.</v>

3941
01:56:09.210 --> 01:56:09.500
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3942
01:56:09.500 --> 01:56:10.440
<v Speaker 6>And because it's,</v>

3943
01:56:10.441 --> 01:56:12.270
<v Speaker 6>if it's common law after a certain amount of years,</v>

3944
01:56:12.271 --> 01:56:14.400
<v Speaker 6>I wonder if the money stops then bell.</v>

3945
01:56:14.401 --> 01:56:15.061
<v Speaker 6>Either way.</v>

3946
01:56:15.061 --> 01:56:18.840
<v Speaker 6>This guy is just beyond fucked and it drives him crazy and he doesn't,</v>

3947
01:56:19.010 --> 01:56:19.450
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3948
01:56:19.450 --> 01:56:21.090
<v Speaker 6>he doesn't even like this person.</v>

3949
01:56:21.091 --> 01:56:25.290
<v Speaker 6>Not only does he not like or he knows that she spent millions of dollars fight</v>

3950
01:56:25.320 --> 01:56:26.130
<v Speaker 6>of his money,</v>

3951
01:56:26.130 --> 01:56:28.290
<v Speaker 6>fighting him in this divorce settlement.</v>

3952
01:56:28.560 --> 01:56:29.600
<v Speaker 6>And then once it came in,</v>

3953
01:56:30.200 --> 01:56:32.070
<v Speaker 6>I was talking about a guy who did anything terrible.</v>

3954
01:56:32.190 --> 01:56:33.190
<v Speaker 6>He didn't kill anybody.</v>

3955
01:56:33.191 --> 01:56:34.170
<v Speaker 6>He didn't rob anybody.</v>

3956
01:56:34.171 --> 01:56:34.650
<v Speaker 6>He didn't.</v>

3957
01:56:34.650 --> 01:56:39.650
<v Speaker 6>But he's become a victim of legal system and this legal system has him obligated</v>

3958
01:56:40.201 --> 01:56:44.610
<v Speaker 6>to pay this woman until she stops breathing on planet earth.</v>

3959
01:56:45.030 --> 01:56:46.110
<v Speaker 6>She's Christ,</v>

3960
01:56:46.600 --> 01:56:47.670
<v Speaker 6>so fuck California.</v>

3961
01:56:47.671 --> 01:56:48.930
<v Speaker 6>So she's only like,</v>

3962
01:56:49.110 --> 01:56:51.660
<v Speaker 6>I think she's in her forties so for 12 years.</v>

3963
01:56:52.080 --> 01:56:52.530
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3964
01:56:52.530 --> 01:56:53.760
<v Speaker 6>So if they,</v>

3965
01:56:53.970 --> 01:56:56.160
<v Speaker 6>if they live another 30 or 40 years,</v>

3966
01:56:56.310 --> 01:56:57.430
<v Speaker 6>this fucking guy has to pay,</v>

3967
01:56:57.431 --> 01:56:59.130
<v Speaker 6>or hundreds of thousands of dollars a year.</v>

3968
01:56:59.280 --> 01:57:00.570
<v Speaker 6>And I think it's almost a million.</v>

3969
01:57:00.750 --> 01:57:02.700
<v Speaker 6>I think it's not just hundreds of thousands.</v>

3970
01:57:02.701 --> 01:57:03.391
<v Speaker 6>I think it's many,</v>

3971
01:57:03.391 --> 01:57:04.350
<v Speaker 6>many hundreds of thousands.</v>

3972
01:57:04.500 --> 01:57:05.550
<v Speaker 6>And he's a wealthy man.</v>

3973
01:57:05.640 --> 01:57:06.301
<v Speaker 6>Don't get me wrong,</v>

3974
01:57:06.301 --> 01:57:07.140
<v Speaker 6>he's done very well,</v>

3975
01:57:07.141 --> 01:57:08.700
<v Speaker 6>but he works for a living.</v>

3976
01:57:08.880 --> 01:57:12.260
<v Speaker 6>And this is a guy who has his own business checks for a living.</v>

3977
01:57:12.270 --> 01:57:12.811
<v Speaker 6>He's not a,</v>

3978
01:57:12.811 --> 01:57:13.620
<v Speaker 6>he's not a thief.</v>

3979
01:57:13.620 --> 01:57:13.801
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

3980
01:57:13.801 --> 01:57:14.231
<v Speaker 6>he's not like,</v>

3981
01:57:14.231 --> 01:57:14.760
<v Speaker 6>this is not,</v>

3982
01:57:14.760 --> 01:57:17.490
<v Speaker 6>his guy's not doing anything unscrupulous to make this money.</v>

3983
01:57:17.491 --> 01:57:20.940
<v Speaker 6>So this is all money that he earned because he runs his own business and he's a</v>

3984
01:57:20.941 --> 01:57:21.930
<v Speaker 6>fucking workhorse,</v>

3985
01:57:21.931 --> 01:57:22.740
<v Speaker 6>this guy.</v>

3986
01:57:22.740 --> 01:57:25.260
<v Speaker 6>And he dated a woman that was better looking than him.</v>

3987
01:57:25.560 --> 01:57:26.393
<v Speaker 6>He fucked up.</v>

3988
01:57:26.550 --> 01:57:26.881
<v Speaker 6>He dated.</v>

3989
01:57:26.881 --> 01:57:29.010
<v Speaker 6>A woman has better looking at him and it didn't work out.</v>

3990
01:57:29.280 --> 01:57:29.821
<v Speaker 6>And then,</v>

3991
01:57:29.821 --> 01:57:30.181
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3992
01:57:30.181 --> 01:57:30.930
<v Speaker 6>he just thought,</v>

3993
01:57:30.930 --> 01:57:32.160
<v Speaker 6>I don't need a prenuptial.</v>

3994
01:57:32.161 --> 01:57:32.790
<v Speaker 6>I love her.</v>

3995
01:57:32.790 --> 01:57:33.900
<v Speaker 6>She hasn't won a prenuptial.</v>

3996
01:57:34.230 --> 01:57:35.460
<v Speaker 6>So this is how crazy this guy is.</v>

3997
01:57:35.880 --> 01:57:40.830
<v Speaker 6>He gets married again after this and his new wife wants to have no prenup.</v>

3998
01:57:41.340 --> 01:57:42.130
<v Speaker 6>And he was,</v>

3999
01:57:42.130 --> 01:57:45.030
<v Speaker 6>he was thinking of going through with it and everybody was fucking grabbing</v>

4000
01:57:45.680 --> 01:57:46.513
<v Speaker 6>this.</v>

4001
01:57:47.370 --> 01:57:50.550
<v Speaker 6>We've been going through this with you for the past three fucking years.</v>

4002
01:57:50.670 --> 01:57:52.330
<v Speaker 6>You are not going to do it.</v>

4003
01:57:52.680 --> 01:57:52.891
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

4004
01:57:52.891 --> 01:57:53.220
<v Speaker 6>he didn't.</v>

4005
01:57:53.220 --> 01:57:54.053
<v Speaker 6>He got a Prenup,</v>

4006
01:57:54.060 --> 01:57:55.380
<v Speaker 6>got a very generous Prenup,</v>

4007
01:57:55.381 --> 01:57:56.660
<v Speaker 6>but as a prenup and they got married.</v>

4008
01:57:56.760 --> 01:57:58.470
<v Speaker 6>The point being a prenup at least if it,</v>

4009
01:57:58.471 --> 01:57:59.430
<v Speaker 6>even if it's ridiculous,</v>

4010
01:57:59.431 --> 01:58:02.370
<v Speaker 6>even if like you know Esther and Brian get married and and Brian is to pay</v>

4011
01:58:02.380 --> 01:58:05.100
<v Speaker 6>Esther a million dollars a year for the rest of her life.</v>

4012
01:58:05.101 --> 01:58:05.910
<v Speaker 6>If they break up,</v>

4013
01:58:05.910 --> 01:58:08.400
<v Speaker 6>at least that's set in stone where she can't say,</v>

4014
01:58:08.401 --> 01:58:09.420
<v Speaker 6>fuck you Brian,</v>

4015
01:58:09.510 --> 01:58:10.740
<v Speaker 6>I want $3 million.</v>

4016
01:58:10.800 --> 01:58:12.750
<v Speaker 6>I can't believe I sucked your Dick or can't believe that.</v>

4017
01:58:14.200 --> 01:58:17.190
<v Speaker 6>That's what happens when people get angry at each other when they get divorced.</v>

4018
01:58:17.191 --> 01:58:20.220
<v Speaker 6>They just fight and they fight and they fight and then there becomes this,</v>

4019
01:58:20.221 --> 01:58:23.310
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to break this motherfucker and then you figured out how to do it.</v>

4020
01:58:23.370 --> 01:58:24.990
<v Speaker 6>Getting married is a divorce.</v>

4021
01:58:24.991 --> 01:58:27.450
<v Speaker 6>Fights sound fucking awful.</v>

4022
01:58:27.540 --> 01:58:30.390
<v Speaker 6>Well the only sound awful because they can be awful.</v>

4023
01:58:30.420 --> 01:58:32.850
<v Speaker 6>That's the thing that's really crazy about marriage.</v>

4024
01:58:32.960 --> 01:58:33.210
<v Speaker 6>It just,</v>

4025
01:58:33.210 --> 01:58:34.650
<v Speaker 6>cause they can be awful.</v>

4026
01:58:34.770 --> 01:58:35.850
<v Speaker 6>You can demand,</v>

4027
01:58:36.170 --> 01:58:38.550
<v Speaker 6>there's a legal thing going on.</v>

4028
01:58:38.580 --> 01:58:43.060
<v Speaker 6>There's a contract that's disputed so you can battle about it.</v>

4029
01:58:43.210 --> 01:58:45.640
<v Speaker 6>Whereas like if you guys were just dating,</v>

4030
01:58:45.730 --> 01:58:46.750
<v Speaker 6>okay and you broke up.</v>

4031
01:58:46.751 --> 01:58:47.350
<v Speaker 6>Well that's it.</v>

4032
01:58:47.350 --> 01:58:48.183
<v Speaker 6>It's over.</v>

4033
01:58:48.260 --> 01:58:48.580
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

4034
01:58:48.580 --> 01:58:49.151
<v Speaker 6>Brian says,</v>

4035
01:58:49.151 --> 01:58:50.080
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to date you anymore.</v>

4036
01:58:50.200 --> 01:58:50.591
<v Speaker 6>And you're like,</v>

4037
01:58:50.591 --> 01:58:51.371
<v Speaker 6>fuck you went on a date.</v>

4038
01:58:51.371 --> 01:58:51.911
<v Speaker 6>You anymore either,</v>

4039
01:58:51.911 --> 01:58:52.750
<v Speaker 6>but I want money.</v>

4040
01:58:53.290 --> 01:58:53.921
<v Speaker 6>Brian would be like,</v>

4041
01:58:53.921 --> 01:58:54.641
<v Speaker 6>what are you talking about?</v>

4042
01:58:54.641 --> 01:58:55.560
<v Speaker 6>I'm not giving you money.</v>

4043
01:58:55.780 --> 01:58:56.613
<v Speaker 6>Get away from me.</v>

4044
01:58:56.770 --> 01:58:57.760
<v Speaker 6>You know like get Outta here.</v>

4045
01:58:57.761 --> 01:58:58.181
<v Speaker 6>Stop.</v>

4046
01:58:58.181 --> 01:58:59.410
<v Speaker 6>Will you change your phone number?</v>

4047
01:58:59.411 --> 01:59:00.160
<v Speaker 6>And we're over.</v>

4048
01:59:00.160 --> 01:59:00.841
<v Speaker 6>It's over the,</v>

4049
01:59:00.841 --> 01:59:01.031
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

4050
01:59:01.031 --> 01:59:01.290
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

4051
01:59:01.290 --> 01:59:01.440
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

4052
01:59:01.440 --> 01:59:02.500
<v Speaker 6>the battle ends.</v>

4053
01:59:02.710 --> 01:59:03.730
<v Speaker 6>But if you're married,</v>

4054
01:59:04.620 --> 01:59:08.260
<v Speaker 6>the battle is just be just be guys.</v>

4055
01:59:08.740 --> 01:59:10.480
<v Speaker 6>And then the lawyers get together and they,</v>

4056
01:59:10.481 --> 01:59:13.300
<v Speaker 6>they touch each other and they rub hands and they go,</v>

4057
01:59:13.301 --> 01:59:16.570
<v Speaker 6>we're going to clean this motherfucker out because you've got two lawyers who</v>

4058
01:59:16.571 --> 01:59:20.920
<v Speaker 6>are working for the same guy and they're battling a different position.</v>

4059
01:59:21.190 --> 01:59:21.970
<v Speaker 6>One boy,</v>

4060
01:59:21.970 --> 01:59:23.470
<v Speaker 6>he's working for you,</v>

4061
01:59:23.560 --> 01:59:25.510
<v Speaker 6>but you're battling for the wife,</v>

4062
01:59:25.660 --> 01:59:27.640
<v Speaker 6>but you're still getting the checks from the same guy.</v>

4063
01:59:27.710 --> 01:59:28.440
<v Speaker 6>He's fun.</v>

4064
01:59:28.440 --> 01:59:31.210
<v Speaker 6>So they know that they only have to do is stretch this dance out.</v>

4065
01:59:31.390 --> 01:59:35.140
<v Speaker 6>So they kept this dance going for I think more than two years.</v>

4066
01:59:35.260 --> 01:59:36.130
<v Speaker 6>More than two years.</v>

4067
01:59:36.131 --> 01:59:37.310
<v Speaker 6>This guy was going through divorce.</v>

4068
01:59:37.890 --> 01:59:38.723
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>

4069
01:59:39.010 --> 01:59:39.843
<v Speaker 6>Jess</v>

4070
01:59:40.820 --> 01:59:42.370
<v Speaker 6>and I would see me be gray,</v>

4071
01:59:42.580 --> 01:59:43.840
<v Speaker 6>like gray skin,</v>

4072
01:59:43.900 --> 01:59:47.290
<v Speaker 6>sweaty and fucking just freaking the fuck out.</v>

4073
01:59:47.590 --> 01:59:49.210
<v Speaker 6>Just hemorrhaging money,</v>

4074
01:59:49.360 --> 01:59:51.400
<v Speaker 6>hemorrhaging and working all day,</v>

4075
01:59:51.550 --> 01:59:52.270
<v Speaker 6>working everyday,</v>

4076
01:59:52.270 --> 01:59:52.571
<v Speaker 6>nine,</v>

4077
01:59:52.571 --> 01:59:53.404
<v Speaker 6>10 hours a day,</v>

4078
01:59:53.590 --> 01:59:54.071
<v Speaker 6>coming home.</v>

4079
01:59:54.071 --> 01:59:54.904
<v Speaker 6>Exhausted.</v>

4080
01:59:55.660 --> 01:59:56.350
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>

4081
01:59:56.350 --> 01:59:56.591
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>

4082
01:59:56.591 --> 01:59:57.424
<v Speaker 6>You want to kids.</v>

4083
01:59:57.700 --> 01:59:58.900
<v Speaker 6>It's not just that he,</v>

4084
01:59:58.901 --> 01:59:59.190
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

4085
01:59:59.190 --> 01:59:59.560
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4086
01:59:59.560 --> 02:00:00.400
<v Speaker 6>he loves this woman.</v>

4087
02:00:00.401 --> 02:00:01.181
<v Speaker 6>Just those other women.</v>

4088
02:00:01.181 --> 02:00:01.690
<v Speaker 6>The ladies just not,</v>

4089
02:00:01.690 --> 02:00:03.610
<v Speaker 6>it's not that he doesn't believe in relationships,</v>

4090
02:00:03.700 --> 02:00:06.370
<v Speaker 6>it's just the relationship that he had just didn't work.</v>

4091
02:00:06.610 --> 02:00:07.121
<v Speaker 6>And he was,</v>

4092
02:00:07.121 --> 02:00:07.740
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4093
02:00:07.740 --> 02:00:08.740
<v Speaker 6>he just couldn't,</v>

4094
02:00:08.890 --> 02:00:10.180
<v Speaker 6>sometimes it doesn't work.</v>

4095
02:00:10.630 --> 02:00:12.010
<v Speaker 6>Sometimes people are great,</v>

4096
02:00:12.040 --> 02:00:16.240
<v Speaker 6>sometimes you're great and he's great to pay alimony to the guy because when</v>

4097
02:00:16.241 --> 02:00:17.110
<v Speaker 6>they started going out,</v>

4098
02:00:17.111 --> 02:00:20.170
<v Speaker 6>he was making more money and then she started surpassing him and wrote a</v>

4099
02:00:20.171 --> 02:00:20.741
<v Speaker 6>screenplay.</v>

4100
02:00:20.741 --> 02:00:23.830
<v Speaker 6>And then those moments are so rare.</v>

4101
02:00:23.831 --> 02:00:25.450
<v Speaker 6>I hate when people even talk about them.</v>

4102
02:00:25.600 --> 02:00:28.480
<v Speaker 6>That's like the when when women say sometimes women rape men.</v>

4103
02:00:29.500 --> 02:00:30.310
<v Speaker 6>Okay,</v>

4104
02:00:30.310 --> 02:00:35.290
<v Speaker 6>maybe they do it a million times that the women are paying alimony.</v>

4105
02:00:35.291 --> 02:00:36.124
<v Speaker 6>How rare are those</v>

4106
02:00:38.150 --> 02:00:38.983
<v Speaker 6>50 Joe?</v>

4107
02:00:40.810 --> 02:00:41.341
<v Speaker 6>Well then with,</v>

4108
02:00:41.341 --> 02:00:43.000
<v Speaker 6>it would be a good argument to quit alimony.</v>

4109
02:00:43.001 --> 02:00:43.930
<v Speaker 6>Let's just bail on it.</v>

4110
02:00:44.140 --> 02:00:44.973
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

4111
02:00:45.070 --> 02:00:46.480
<v Speaker 6>I think alimony is nonsense.</v>

4112
02:00:46.720 --> 02:00:49.600
<v Speaker 6>I think if you do have someone know that you've been taken care of for a certain</v>

4113
02:00:49.601 --> 02:00:50.320
<v Speaker 6>amount of time,</v>

4114
02:00:50.320 --> 02:00:52.480
<v Speaker 6>like if you care about them at all,</v>

4115
02:00:52.660 --> 02:00:55.180
<v Speaker 6>you have an obligation to help them.</v>

4116
02:00:55.181 --> 02:00:55.571
<v Speaker 6>You know what?</v>

4117
02:00:55.571 --> 02:00:57.400
<v Speaker 6>I don't like people struggling financially.</v>

4118
02:00:57.400 --> 02:00:59.140
<v Speaker 6>I think it's a horrible thing to see.</v>

4119
02:00:59.410 --> 02:01:01.390
<v Speaker 6>That's one of the most stressful things in your life.</v>

4120
02:01:01.660 --> 02:01:06.330
<v Speaker 6>And if someone can help someone and was sort of like help them move along till</v>

4121
02:01:06.331 --> 02:01:08.530
<v Speaker 6>like a more prosperous future without them.</v>

4122
02:01:08.590 --> 02:01:09.610
<v Speaker 6>There's nothing wrong with that.</v>

4123
02:01:09.880 --> 02:01:12.700
<v Speaker 6>But when you get obligations like my friend who's like,</v>

4124
02:01:12.701 --> 02:01:15.820
<v Speaker 6>I think he has to be seven or $800,000 a year,</v>

4125
02:01:16.200 --> 02:01:17.110
<v Speaker 6>she is forever.</v>

4126
02:01:17.710 --> 02:01:18.543
<v Speaker 6>Forever.</v>

4127
02:01:18.580 --> 02:01:19.700
<v Speaker 6>What if he start lakes?</v>

4128
02:01:20.080 --> 02:01:22.450
<v Speaker 6>What if he doesn't make as much money next year?</v>

4129
02:01:22.520 --> 02:01:22.991
<v Speaker 6>And you know what,</v>

4130
02:01:22.991 --> 02:01:23.830
<v Speaker 6>I think I might be wrong.</v>

4131
02:01:23.860 --> 02:01:26.480
<v Speaker 6>I think it's more than a million now that I'm thinking about it because there's</v>

4132
02:01:26.500 --> 02:01:27.333
<v Speaker 6>a bunch of other,</v>

4133
02:01:27.460 --> 02:01:29.080
<v Speaker 6>there's like a bunch of shit tacked in.</v>

4134
02:01:29.500 --> 02:01:30.100
<v Speaker 6>There's all this,</v>

4135
02:01:30.100 --> 02:01:30.341
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

4136
02:01:30.341 --> 02:01:31.174
<v Speaker 6>it's so crazy.</v>

4137
02:01:31.630 --> 02:01:32.980
<v Speaker 6>And this is like what he settled on.</v>

<v Speaker 6>They're there sweeties they're the nicest folks.</v>

4177
02:02:46.960 --> 02:02:47.591
<v Speaker 6>They're like their,</v>

4178
02:02:47.591 --> 02:02:47.831
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4180
02:02:51.160 --> 02:02:52.900
<v Speaker 6>their kid is the same age as my kids.</v>

4181
02:02:53.060 --> 02:02:54.610
<v Speaker 6>We played together all the time.</v>

4182
02:02:54.670 --> 02:02:56.920
<v Speaker 6>He's always over the house to the nicest people.</v>

4183
02:02:56.921 --> 02:02:59.590
<v Speaker 6>Just for someone who doesn't know gay people,</v>

4184
02:02:59.591 --> 02:03:02.440
<v Speaker 6>it just seems weird that these two guys are in love with each other and that</v>

4185
02:03:02.441 --> 02:03:03.550
<v Speaker 6>they hold hands and,</v>

4186
02:03:03.790 --> 02:03:05.050
<v Speaker 6>but once you get used to them,</v>

4187
02:03:05.051 --> 02:03:06.070
<v Speaker 6>the dynamic of them,</v>

4188
02:03:06.071 --> 02:03:06.940
<v Speaker 6>you know who they are,</v>

4189
02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:07.930
<v Speaker 6>they're the nicest,</v>

4190
02:03:07.931 --> 02:03:10.120
<v Speaker 6>friendliest people and they get along.</v>

4191
02:03:10.150 --> 02:03:10.931
<v Speaker 6>It works great.</v>

4192
02:03:10.931 --> 02:03:12.130
<v Speaker 6>Like they'd been together for years</v>

4193
02:03:12.200 --> 02:03:12.831
<v Speaker 4>and the kids,</v>

4194
02:03:12.831 --> 02:03:14.840
<v Speaker 4>not traumatized kids fine.</v>

4195
02:03:14.870 --> 02:03:16.460
<v Speaker 4>The kids like this is awesome.</v>

4196
02:03:16.461 --> 02:03:17.510
<v Speaker 4>My Dad's are awesome.</v>

4197
02:03:17.750 --> 02:03:19.080
<v Speaker 6>One of the reasons why the kids finds,</v>

4198
02:03:19.090 --> 02:03:22.300
<v Speaker 6>because we live in California and California is very open minded when it comes</v>

4199
02:03:22.301 --> 02:03:22.930
<v Speaker 6>to gay people,</v>

4200
02:03:22.930 --> 02:03:25.780
<v Speaker 6>it's more open minded I think in any place else I've ever lived.</v>

4201
02:03:26.260 --> 02:03:27.093
<v Speaker 6>It's like uh,</v>

4202
02:03:27.160 --> 02:03:27.881
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4203
02:03:27.881 --> 02:03:30.110
<v Speaker 6>so much so that it's,</v>

4204
02:03:30.220 --> 02:03:35.220
<v Speaker 6>it's becoming more of an issue if you're a homophobe than it is if you're gay.</v>

4205
02:03:35.770 --> 02:03:37.540
<v Speaker 6>Like if people find out you're homophobic,</v>

4206
02:03:37.541 --> 02:03:38.680
<v Speaker 6>it's so repulsive.</v>

4207
02:03:38.681 --> 02:03:38.951
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>

4208
02:03:38.951 --> 02:03:40.060
<v Speaker 6>what do you give a shit?</v>

4209
02:03:40.270 --> 02:03:42.310
<v Speaker 6>I that's more repulsive than it is.</v>

4210
02:03:42.311 --> 02:03:44.020
<v Speaker 6>Like if you're a homophobic person,</v>

4211
02:03:44.021 --> 02:03:45.650
<v Speaker 6>you see a gay person like this,</v>

4212
02:03:45.670 --> 02:03:46.960
<v Speaker 6>it's almost more,</v>

4213
02:03:47.410 --> 02:03:51.340
<v Speaker 6>more stigmatizing to be homophobic than it is.</v>

4214
02:03:51.341 --> 02:03:54.550
<v Speaker 6>Like as far as like numbers go than it is to be gay almost.</v>

4215
02:03:54.900 --> 02:03:55.740
<v Speaker 4>That would be the goal,</v>

4216
02:03:55.741 --> 02:03:56.041
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4217
02:03:56.041 --> 02:03:58.970
<v Speaker 4>The goal would be to make being a homophobe horrible.</v>

4218
02:03:58.990 --> 02:04:02.160
<v Speaker 4>He's just amazing as far as just people.</v>

4219
02:04:02.490 --> 02:04:06.210
<v Speaker 4>People don't want to offend you that they go so far as to like be like,</v>

4220
02:04:06.240 --> 02:04:06.541
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

4221
02:04:06.541 --> 02:04:07.410
<v Speaker 4>what'd you like to,</v>

4222
02:04:07.700 --> 02:04:08.131
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4223
02:04:08.131 --> 02:04:09.370
<v Speaker 4>get a breast implant?</v>

4224
02:04:09.371 --> 02:04:09.510
<v Speaker 4>Who,</v>

4225
02:04:09.510 --> 02:04:09.781
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

4226
02:04:09.781 --> 02:04:10.351
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>

4227
02:04:10.351 --> 02:04:12.510
<v Speaker 4>Like it's just trans like gender.</v>

4228
02:04:12.511 --> 02:04:13.950
<v Speaker 4>People are just everywhere.</v>

4229
02:04:13.951 --> 02:04:14.720
<v Speaker 4>And it's,</v>

4230
02:04:14.720 --> 02:04:15.570
<v Speaker 4>it's so,</v>

4231
02:04:15.571 --> 02:04:18.060
<v Speaker 4>except there's a transgender comedian in San Francisco.</v>

4232
02:04:18.061 --> 02:04:18.894
<v Speaker 4>Have you seen him?</v>

4233
02:04:19.620 --> 02:04:19.951

02:04:22.560 --> 02:04:22.891
<v Speaker 4>Gender.</v>

4237
02:04:22.891 --> 02:04:23.760
<v Speaker 4>It's super bad.</v>

4238
02:04:25.380 --> 02:04:26.340
<v Speaker 4>I forget her name,</v>

4239
02:04:26.341 --> 02:04:27.570
<v Speaker 4>but she was hilarious.</v>

4240
02:04:28.030 --> 02:04:31.960
<v Speaker 6>I don't understand people getting upset at something is obviously a mistake as</v>

4241
02:04:31.961 --> 02:04:32.794
<v Speaker 6>miss gender.</v>

4242
02:04:33.130 --> 02:04:36.760
<v Speaker 6>Like if you used to be a man and now you're a woman and someone actually calls</v>

4243
02:04:36.761 --> 02:04:38.730
<v Speaker 6>you relax.</v>

02:05:17.400 --> 02:05:20.550
<v Speaker 1>And nobody gets upset and if they do stop hanging out with them.</v>

4282
02:05:20.850 --> 02:05:21.683
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4283
02:05:22.050 --> 02:05:26.070
<v Speaker 1>Because if someone says guys is not really just got the problem is it's so</v>

4284
02:05:26.071 --> 02:05:27.150
<v Speaker 1>gender specific,</v>

4285
02:05:27.151 --> 02:05:28.710
<v Speaker 1>there's no like female</v>

4286
02:05:30.270 --> 02:05:31.680
<v Speaker 1>equivalent to guys,</v>

4287
02:05:31.890 --> 02:05:32.221
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4288
02:05:32.221 --> 02:05:34.300
<v Speaker 1>where you could say a bunch of girls can be guys,</v>

4289
02:05:34.820 --> 02:05:36.420
<v Speaker 1>but that just sounds dumb.</v>

4290
02:05:36.650 --> 02:05:37.001
<v Speaker 1>Do you have a,</v>

4291
02:05:37.001 --> 02:05:37.631
<v Speaker 1>nobody's scared.</v>

4292
02:05:37.631 --> 02:05:38.340
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

4293
02:05:38.340 --> 02:05:38.581
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4294
02:05:38.581 --> 02:05:38.911
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

4295
02:05:38.911 --> 02:05:40.230
<v Speaker 1>no one uses it universally.</v>

4296
02:05:40.380 --> 02:05:43.500
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't see a group of men and someone says,</v>

4297
02:05:43.501 --> 02:05:45.390
<v Speaker 1>hey girls or hey gals,</v>

4298
02:05:45.600 --> 02:05:48.000
<v Speaker 1>but you could see like five girls and go,</v>

4299
02:05:48.001 --> 02:05:48.781
<v Speaker 1>what's up guys?</v>

4300
02:05:48.781 --> 02:05:49.614
<v Speaker 1>What's up?</v>

4301
02:05:49.650 --> 02:05:51.030
<v Speaker 1>And somehow or another,</v>

4302
02:05:51.031 --> 02:05:51.864
<v Speaker 1>it's acceptable.</v>

4303
02:05:51.960 --> 02:05:54.360
<v Speaker 1>Girls like you can go up to your friends and go,</v>

4304
02:05:54.361 --> 02:05:55.590
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck you guys doing?</v>

4305
02:05:55.830 --> 02:05:56.880
<v Speaker 1>You can actually say that,</v>

4306
02:05:57.030 --> 02:05:57.520
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4307
02:05:57.520 --> 02:05:58.000
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>

4308
02:05:58.000 --> 02:05:58.960
<v Speaker 4>It's not weird.</v>

4309
02:05:58.990 --> 02:05:59.560
<v Speaker 4>It's not weird.</v>

4310
02:05:59.560 --> 02:06:01.390
<v Speaker 4>It's like it happens all the time.</v>

4311
02:06:01.630 --> 02:06:01.781
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4312
02:06:01.781 --> 02:06:02.350
<v Speaker 4>What is that?</v>

4313
02:06:02.350 --> 02:06:03.183
<v Speaker 4>How is that?</v>

4314
02:06:03.760 --> 02:06:07.810
<v Speaker 4>Because we just live in such a male dominated world.</v>

4315
02:06:08.050 --> 02:06:09.430
<v Speaker 4>Is that frustrating being a woman?</v>

4316
02:06:09.880 --> 02:06:10.713
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

4317
02:06:10.810 --> 02:06:13.150
<v Speaker 4>well it was when I was a kid.</v>

4318
02:06:13.180 --> 02:06:14.013
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4319
02:06:14.410 --> 02:06:17.530
<v Speaker 4>Because like I just was surrounded by guys so I thought,</v>

4320
02:06:17.650 --> 02:06:18.160
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4321
02:06:18.160 --> 02:06:23.160
<v Speaker 4>so I felt like I have three brothers so I was just like constantly battling for</v>

4322
02:06:24.491 --> 02:06:25.324
<v Speaker 4>the toilet</v>

4323
02:06:27.430 --> 02:06:27.870
<v Speaker 4>is that way.</v>

4324
02:06:27.870 --> 02:06:29.080
<v Speaker 4>So I'm talking about poop.</v>

4325
02:06:29.200 --> 02:06:29.801
<v Speaker 4>Well No,</v>

4326
02:06:29.801 --> 02:06:30.521
<v Speaker 4>you know what it is.</v>

4327
02:06:30.521 --> 02:06:35.110
<v Speaker 4>It's like I grew up seeing my brother's like pee in the toilet together cause</v>

4328
02:06:35.111 --> 02:06:39.880
<v Speaker 4>they could stand next to each other and all p at the same time that I just got</v>

4329
02:06:39.881 --> 02:06:40.571
<v Speaker 4>so jealous.</v>

4330
02:06:40.571 --> 02:06:40.960
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

4331
02:06:40.960 --> 02:06:41.711
<v Speaker 4>when I pee,</v>

4332
02:06:41.711 --> 02:06:44.020
<v Speaker 4>I take up the whole toilet by myself.</v>

4333
02:06:44.021 --> 02:06:46.600
<v Speaker 4>I can't hang out with people while peeing.</v>

4334
02:06:47.410 --> 02:06:48.243
<v Speaker 4>And I thought,</v>

4335
02:06:48.310 --> 02:06:49.120
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

4336
02:06:49.120 --> 02:06:49.960
<v Speaker 4>it would be awesome.</v>

4337
02:06:51.400 --> 02:06:52.690
<v Speaker 1>You're going to see those things.</v>

4338
02:06:52.930 --> 02:06:55.600
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen those things as they have for Women Where They Get pee outdoors?</v>

4339
02:06:55.990 --> 02:06:57.660
<v Speaker 1>It's like a funnel you put over your box.</v>

4340
02:06:57.700 --> 02:07:00.070
<v Speaker 1>They have that at like bass pro shops and stuff.</v>

4341
02:07:00.940 --> 02:07:01.721
<v Speaker 1>I've seen it.</v>

4342
02:07:01.721 --> 02:07:01.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4343
02:07:01.880 --> 02:07:02.600
<v Speaker 1>I'd you can go.</v>

4344
02:07:02.600 --> 02:07:03.433
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4345
02:07:03.730 --> 02:07:04.563
<v Speaker 1>I want to try it.</v>

4346
02:07:04.670 --> 02:07:06.520
<v Speaker 1>It has good reviews online.</v>

4347
02:07:06.580 --> 02:07:06.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4348
02:07:06.910 --> 02:07:10.680
<v Speaker 1>Well the kind of people that I just thing I just enjoy</v>

4349
02:07:10.970 --> 02:07:12.380
<v Speaker 4>over a pile of leaves.</v>

4350
02:07:12.510 --> 02:07:13.040
<v Speaker 4>Do you know?</v>

4351
02:07:13.040 --> 02:07:13.873
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4352
02:07:14.450 --> 02:07:15.280
<v Speaker 4>If you're camping,</v>

4353
02:07:15.280 --> 02:07:16.113
<v Speaker 4>do you camp?</v>

4354
02:07:16.130 --> 02:07:17.000
<v Speaker 4>I've gone camping.</v>

4355
02:07:17.030 --> 02:07:17.863
<v Speaker 4>How many times?</v>

4356
02:07:17.900 --> 02:07:18.680
<v Speaker 4>Twice.</v>

4357
02:07:18.680 --> 02:07:19.513
<v Speaker 4>Did you enjoy it?</v>

4358
02:07:19.670 --> 02:07:21.140
<v Speaker 4>It was so much fun.</v>

4359
02:07:21.230 --> 02:07:21.980
<v Speaker 4>Where'd you go?</v>

4360
02:07:21.980 --> 02:07:22.671
<v Speaker 4>I went in,</v>

4361
02:07:22.671 --> 02:07:23.090
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

4362
02:07:23.090 --> 02:07:26.000
<v Speaker 4>Florida is silver's silver lake,</v>

4363
02:07:26.001 --> 02:07:26.834
<v Speaker 4>silver springs.</v>

4364
02:07:26.950 --> 02:07:28.300
<v Speaker 1>See Camping in Florida.</v>

4365
02:07:28.301 --> 02:07:31.250
<v Speaker 1>It takes on a totally different meaning because you could easily run into a meth</v>

4366
02:07:31.251 --> 02:07:34.450
<v Speaker 1>heads are crazy people out there in the woods.</v>

4367
02:07:34.460 --> 02:07:34.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4368
02:07:34.780 --> 02:07:35.613
<v Speaker 1>Alligators,</v>

4369
02:07:35.740 --> 02:07:36.573
<v Speaker 1>snakes.</v>

4370
02:07:37.150 --> 02:07:38.560
<v Speaker 1>You're lucky you only went twice.</v>

4371
02:07:39.040 --> 02:07:39.520
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>

4372
02:07:39.520 --> 02:07:40.930
<v Speaker 4>Well maybe the third time I will.</v>

4373
02:07:41.070 --> 02:07:44.670
<v Speaker 1>That's like going hunting for Ufo is twice and saying that it was nothing out</v>

4374
02:07:44.671 --> 02:07:45.420
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

4375
02:07:45.420 --> 02:07:46.253
<v Speaker 1>You never know.</v>

4376
02:07:46.590 --> 02:07:47.320
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of,</v>

4377
02:07:47.320 --> 02:07:47.540
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

4378
02:07:47.540 --> 02:07:50.840
<v Speaker 4>I was surprised at like everybody just left all their stuff in the open when</v>

4379
02:07:50.841 --> 02:07:51.500
<v Speaker 4>they ride,</v>

4380
02:07:51.500 --> 02:07:52.730
<v Speaker 4>ride their bikes down the path,</v>

4381
02:07:52.760 --> 02:07:53.091
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4382
02:07:53.091 --> 02:07:56.150
<v Speaker 4>go down to the beach and everybody just has their stuff and you're just on the</v>

4383
02:07:56.450 --> 02:07:57.283
<v Speaker 4>honor system.</v>

4384
02:07:57.650 --> 02:07:58.190
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4385
02:07:58.190 --> 02:07:58.910
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

4386
02:07:58.910 --> 02:08:03.910
<v Speaker 4>and like nothing gets stolen and it's not like it happens right all the time.</v>

4387
02:08:04.170 --> 02:08:05.760
<v Speaker 4>That's our big problem with camp grounds.</v>

4388
02:08:05.920 --> 02:08:06.990
<v Speaker 4>Shiny problem shorts.</v>

4389
02:08:07.010 --> 02:08:07.970
<v Speaker 4>Like lock your shit up.</v>

4390
02:08:08.160 --> 02:08:08.551
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4391
02:08:08.551 --> 02:08:10.470
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you have anything really valuable,</v>

4392
02:08:10.471 --> 02:08:11.490
<v Speaker 1>you lock it up in your car.</v>

4393
02:08:11.491 --> 02:08:11.911
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

4394
02:08:11.911 --> 02:08:13.680
<v Speaker 1>people's tents get robbed all the time.</v>

4395
02:08:14.070 --> 02:08:14.820
<v Speaker 1>Oh Damn.</v>

4396
02:08:14.820 --> 02:08:14.971
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4397
02:08:14.971 --> 02:08:15.801
<v Speaker 1>it's just one of those things.</v>

4398
02:08:15.801 --> 02:08:18.930
<v Speaker 1>And it also attracts a lot of vagrants and a lot of people that are,</v>

4399
02:08:19.440 --> 02:08:19.741
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4400
02:08:19.741 --> 02:08:20.580
<v Speaker 1>they're down on their luck.</v>

4401
02:08:20.581 --> 02:08:21.780
<v Speaker 1>And that's where the sleeping in a tent.</v>

4402
02:08:21.810 --> 02:08:23.610
<v Speaker 1>There's people that are essentially homeless,</v>

4403
02:08:23.611 --> 02:08:24.444
<v Speaker 1>but they have a tent,</v>

4404
02:08:24.780 --> 02:08:25.141
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

4405
02:08:25.141 --> 02:08:29.190
<v Speaker 1>And if you have a cut public campground and there's a shower there,</v>

4406
02:08:29.260 --> 02:08:32.980
<v Speaker 4>you can kind of get a reservation at a public campground that's like hard to get</v>

4407
02:08:32.981 --> 02:08:33.101
<v Speaker 4>to.</v>

4408
02:08:33.101 --> 02:08:37.510
<v Speaker 4>Like you take a ferry and then you get a guy in a jeep picks you up and you know</v>

4409
02:08:37.710 --> 02:08:41.100
<v Speaker 4>you're in trolley and it takes you down to your camp site.</v>

4410
02:08:41.530 --> 02:08:43.660
<v Speaker 1>Brian ever tell you about being from Kevin and bean.</v>

4411
02:08:43.960 --> 02:08:45.070
<v Speaker 1>He lives on an island.</v>

4412
02:08:45.490 --> 02:08:47.650
<v Speaker 1>He lives on an island outside of Seattle.</v>

4413
02:08:47.780 --> 02:08:48.130
<v Speaker 1>Mm.</v>

4414
02:08:48.130 --> 02:08:52.450
<v Speaker 1>You can't even get to it unless you take a ferry guy lives on an island out in</v>

4415
02:08:52.451 --> 02:08:54.310
<v Speaker 1>the middle of the fucking the bay.</v>

4416
02:08:55.240 --> 02:08:55.991
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

4417
02:08:55.991 --> 02:08:57.520
<v Speaker 1>he's kind of in Seattle,</v>

4418
02:08:57.910 --> 02:08:58.421
<v Speaker 1>but he does.</v>

4419
02:08:58.421 --> 02:08:58.601
<v Speaker 1>He ever,</v>

4420
02:08:58.601 --> 02:08:59.434
<v Speaker 1>did.</v>

4421
02:08:59.470 --> 02:09:01.660
<v Speaker 1>You ever know Kevin and being the best?</v>

4422
02:09:01.680 --> 02:09:01.870

4423
02:09:01.870 --> 02:09:02.501
<v Speaker 1>they're awesome.</v>

4424
02:09:02.501 --> 02:09:03.430
<v Speaker 1>And they're still around.</v>

4425
02:09:03.460 --> 02:09:05.620
<v Speaker 1>They're like one of the last radio shows is still around,</v>

4426
02:09:06.220 --> 02:09:07.840
<v Speaker 1>but he um,</v>

4427
02:09:07.870 --> 02:09:12.870
<v Speaker 1>he is wired into the La Studio so he lives in Seattle and Kevin still lives in</v>

4428
02:09:13.961 --> 02:09:16.510
<v Speaker 1>La and the gas come to la when I go,</v>

4429
02:09:16.570 --> 02:09:17.560
<v Speaker 1>when I do the show,</v>

4430
02:09:17.740 --> 02:09:20.320
<v Speaker 1>I do it in studio and um,</v>

4431
02:09:20.860 --> 02:09:22.930
<v Speaker 1>except when I call in tomorrow I'm calling in,</v>

4432
02:09:23.110 --> 02:09:24.610
<v Speaker 1>but when I do it in studio,</v>

4433
02:09:24.670 --> 02:09:29.050
<v Speaker 1>you sit down there with Kevin and being is over the loudspeaker and it sounds</v>

4434
02:09:29.051 --> 02:09:29.980
<v Speaker 1>like he's right there with you,</v>

4435
02:09:30.310 --> 02:09:31.120
<v Speaker 1>but you don't see him.</v>

4436
02:09:31.120 --> 02:09:32.230
<v Speaker 1>He's like the eye in the sky.</v>

4437
02:09:32.231 --> 02:09:32.590
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

4438
02:09:32.590 --> 02:09:33.130
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

4439
02:09:33.130 --> 02:09:36.190
<v Speaker 1>you think they would have it like at least a Skype system going on so you could</v>

4440
02:09:36.191 --> 02:09:37.030
<v Speaker 1>at least see him?</v>

4441
02:09:37.330 --> 02:09:37.511
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4442
02:09:37.511 --> 02:09:39.340
<v Speaker 1>you don't see him see him bed?</v>

4443
02:09:39.590 --> 02:09:39.941
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

4444
02:09:39.941 --> 02:09:40.271
<v Speaker 1>well he,</v>

4445
02:09:40.271 --> 02:09:41.260
<v Speaker 1>you can see them.</v>

4446
02:09:41.261 --> 02:09:43.900
<v Speaker 1>They have some sort of a setup where you could see him on a video camera or</v>

4447
02:09:43.901 --> 02:09:46.030
<v Speaker 1>something like where that Talia delay?</v>

4448
02:09:46.210 --> 02:09:46.600
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4449
02:09:46.600 --> 02:09:47.140
<v Speaker 1>no delay.</v>

4450
02:09:47.140 --> 02:09:47.351
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4451
02:09:47.351 --> 02:09:48.760
<v Speaker 1>because it's like an ISD n line.</v>

4452
02:09:48.761 --> 02:09:50.660
<v Speaker 1>So the delay is so minuscule knows,</v>

4453
02:09:50.680 --> 02:09:51.513
<v Speaker 1>can't tell.</v>

4454
02:09:51.700 --> 02:09:51.941
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4455
02:09:51.941 --> 02:09:52.774
<v Speaker 1>you can't tell.</v>

4456
02:09:53.020 --> 02:09:53.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4457
02:09:53.680 --> 02:09:56.560
<v Speaker 1>W The delay is like difference between this and this.</v>

4458
02:09:57.100 --> 02:09:58.150
<v Speaker 1>Like it's so short,</v>

4459
02:09:58.180 --> 02:09:58.661
<v Speaker 1>it's like this,</v>

4460
02:09:58.661 --> 02:09:59.200
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

4461
02:09:59.200 --> 02:09:59.600
<v Speaker 1>it's like the,</v>

4462
02:09:59.600 --> 02:10:00.880
<v Speaker 1>it's like maybe a half second.</v>

4463
02:10:00.881 --> 02:10:01.714
<v Speaker 1>Not even,</v>

4464
02:10:01.960 --> 02:10:02.231
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4465
02:10:02.231 --> 02:10:03.490
<v Speaker 1>it's like an internet lag.</v>

4466
02:10:03.640 --> 02:10:04.600
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

4467
02:10:04.750 --> 02:10:05.351
<v Speaker 1>it's like paying,</v>

4468
02:10:05.351 --> 02:10:05.591
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

4469
02:10:05.591 --> 02:10:08.630
<v Speaker 1>So if you're saying something and you know the,</v>

4470
02:10:08.631 --> 02:10:09.464
<v Speaker 1>the amount of,</v>

4471
02:10:09.640 --> 02:10:12.820
<v Speaker 1>it's not like that critical that what you're saying has to be like an eighth of</v>

4472
02:10:12.821 --> 02:10:13.720
<v Speaker 1>a second Corker.</v>

4473
02:10:13.810 --> 02:10:15.100
<v Speaker 1>Just whenever it comes out,</v>

4474
02:10:15.101 --> 02:10:17.570
<v Speaker 1>it seems like it's real time so that he,</v>

4475
02:10:17.571 --> 02:10:18.550
<v Speaker 1>he does it from an island,</v>

4476
02:10:18.670 --> 02:10:19.540
<v Speaker 1>but I always wanted like,</v>

4477
02:10:19.570 --> 02:10:20.590
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I could do that,</v>

4478
02:10:20.591 --> 02:10:20.861
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

4479
02:10:20.861 --> 02:10:22.090
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I could live on an island.</v>

4480
02:10:22.091 --> 02:10:23.260
<v Speaker 1>I would kind of weird me out.</v>

4481
02:10:23.290 --> 02:10:23.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4482
02:10:23.770 --> 02:10:25.570
<v Speaker 1>There's this place in San Diego that's like,</v>

4483
02:10:25.571 --> 02:10:29.470
<v Speaker 1>that I went to where you take a ferry over and then it's just like this small</v>

4484
02:10:29.471 --> 02:10:31.120
<v Speaker 1>island and it's a whole community though.</v>

4485
02:10:31.121 --> 02:10:32.560
<v Speaker 1>They have like a little grocery store,</v>

4486
02:10:32.561 --> 02:10:33.660
<v Speaker 1>a little Sushi place,</v>

4487
02:10:34.110 --> 02:10:34.943
<v Speaker 3>dry cleaner,</v>

4488
02:10:35.030 --> 02:10:36.920
<v Speaker 3>but just houses everywhere.</v>

4489
02:10:36.950 --> 02:10:37.490
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

4490
02:10:37.490 --> 02:10:39.620
<v Speaker 3>but it's completely cut off.</v>

4491
02:10:39.621 --> 02:10:41.690
<v Speaker 3>If there's a bad storm or something like that.</v>

4492
02:10:41.691 --> 02:10:43.100
<v Speaker 3>They can't have the ferry.</v>

4493
02:10:43.220 --> 02:10:45.440
<v Speaker 3>Everyone's stuck or not stuck on that island.</v>

4494
02:10:45.650 --> 02:10:49.660
<v Speaker 3>There's that island outside of a San Diego that all the super rich people live.</v>

4495
02:10:49.780 --> 02:10:50.660
<v Speaker 3>That's the island,</v>

4496
02:10:50.661 --> 02:10:50.870
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

4497
02:10:50.870 --> 02:10:51.230
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4498
02:10:51.230 --> 02:10:52.140
<v Speaker 3>That's like Dick Cheney.</v>

4499
02:10:52.141 --> 02:10:53.620
<v Speaker 3>He's got a house out there and yeah.</v>

4500

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4501
02:10:53.991 --> 02:10:55.400
<v Speaker 3>That's a spooky spot.</v>

4502
02:10:55.430 --> 02:10:55.791
<v Speaker 3>Have you been,</v>

4503
02:10:55.791 --> 02:10:56.461
<v Speaker 3>so you've been to that?</v>

4504
02:10:56.461 --> 02:10:56.811
<v Speaker 3>It's so,</v>

4509
02:10:59.660 --> 02:11:00.493
<v Speaker 3>what's it called?</v>

4513
02:11:04.340 --> 02:11:04.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4517
02:11:08.850 --> 02:11:12.030
<v Speaker 1>There was some unsolved murder in some really wealthy family that they felt like</v>

4518
02:11:12.031 --> 02:11:13.560
<v Speaker 1>some shenanigans are taking place.</v>

02:11:29.370 --> 02:11:29.980

02:11:38.970 --> 02:11:43.810
<v Speaker 1>death of Rebecca is how the cranked up here.</v>

4539
02:11:43.870 --> 02:11:47.830
<v Speaker 1>It was discovered dead July 13th,</v>

4540
02:11:47.830 --> 02:11:48.663
<v Speaker 1>2011.</v>

4541
02:11:49.690 --> 02:11:54.370
<v Speaker 1>She was like the step mom and they thought that she killed his son.</v>

4542
02:11:54.910 --> 02:11:58.480
<v Speaker 1>And so all of a sudden she goes missing and she's murdered.</v>

4543
02:11:58.750 --> 02:11:58.901
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

4544
02:11:58.901 --> 02:11:59.734
<v Speaker 1>this is what happened.</v>

4545
02:11:59.770 --> 02:12:03.880
<v Speaker 1>She died two days after this guy's son,</v>

4546
02:12:04.270 --> 02:12:06.850
<v Speaker 1>Max took a fatal fall from a staircase,</v>

4547
02:12:06.851 --> 02:12:09.100
<v Speaker 1>banister in the same beach house.</v>

4548
02:12:09.610 --> 02:12:12.970
<v Speaker 1>The woman was the only adult present at the time of his fall.</v>

4549
02:12:13.710 --> 02:12:18.340
<v Speaker 1>So she killed his son or she fucked up.</v>

4550
02:12:19.510 --> 02:12:20.343
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4551
02:12:20.680 --> 02:12:24.220
<v Speaker 1>Bill Gore announced September 2nd,</v>

4552
02:12:24.220 --> 02:12:24.221
<v Speaker 1>2011.</v>

4553
02:12:24.221 --> 02:12:25.031
<v Speaker 1>That's a how,</v>

4554
02:12:25.031 --> 02:12:29.440
<v Speaker 1>whose death was a suicide while the younger or something,</v>

4555
02:12:29.441 --> 02:12:34.441
<v Speaker 1>something was an accident and that neither was the result of foul play.</v>

4556
02:12:34.710 --> 02:12:36.700
<v Speaker 1>Remember as a host family sued,</v>

4557
02:12:37.240 --> 02:12:38.073
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4558
02:12:38.150 --> 02:12:41.890
<v Speaker 1>Max's parents for $10 million disputing the contention that her death was</v>

4559
02:12:41.891 --> 02:12:42.580
<v Speaker 1>suicide.</v>

4560
02:12:42.580 --> 02:12:43.413

02:12:43.600 --> 02:12:44.470
<v Speaker 1>How'd that settle?</v>

4562
02:12:45.090 --> 02:12:46.540
<v Speaker 1>How'd the lawsuit play out?</v>

4563
02:12:48.790 --> 02:12:52.030
<v Speaker 1>So you can sue someone for something like civil lawsuits are really tricky.</v>

4564
02:12:52.420 --> 02:12:53.121
<v Speaker 1>It's like where,</v>

4565
02:12:53.121 --> 02:12:53.460
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4566
02:12:53.460 --> 02:12:53.690

4581
02:13:16.660 --> 02:13:17.410

<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

4585
02:13:22.211 --> 02:13:23.044
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they know.</v>

4586
02:13:23.290 --> 02:13:26.260
<v Speaker 1>No one was there except the dude and her and he probably pushed her off the</v>

4587
02:13:26.261 --> 02:13:27.094
<v Speaker 1>fucking side.</v>

4588
02:13:27.100 --> 02:13:30.160
<v Speaker 1>But I was like pitching show my baby most likely.</v>

4589
02:13:30.450 --> 02:13:31.170
<v Speaker 1>It seems like it.</v>

4590
02:13:31.170 --> 02:13:32.280
<v Speaker 1>She might've killed herself too.</v>

4591
02:13:32.670 --> 02:13:33.960
<v Speaker 1>She might have fucking hated him,</v>

4592
02:13:33.961 --> 02:13:35.760
<v Speaker 1>blaming her for a stupid kid jumping.</v>

4593
02:13:35.761 --> 02:13:36.061
<v Speaker 1>So He's,</v>

4594
02:13:36.061 --> 02:13:36.481
<v Speaker 1>she's like,</v>

4595
02:13:36.481 --> 02:13:36.991
<v Speaker 1>you know what pitch?</v>

02:13:36.991 --> 02:13:37.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna get you in trouble.</v>

4597
02:13:38.100 --> 02:13:38.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking to myself,</v>

4598
02:13:39.120 --> 02:13:40.290
<v Speaker 1>it was a huge house,</v>

4599
02:13:40.291 --> 02:13:40.830
<v Speaker 1>so he,</v>

4600
02:13:40.830 --> 02:13:45.150
<v Speaker 1>the boy like could've just fallen off a staircase and just died accidentally.</v>

4601
02:13:45.180 --> 02:13:46.710
<v Speaker 1>She's probably wasn't paying attention.</v>

4602
02:13:46.711 --> 02:13:47.430
<v Speaker 1>That's probably why.</v>

4603
02:13:47.430 --> 02:13:48.510
<v Speaker 1>If someone wanted to kill her,</v>

4604
02:13:48.511 --> 02:13:49.590
<v Speaker 1>that's why they would want to kill her.</v>

4605
02:13:49.591 --> 02:13:51.160
<v Speaker 1>Just they were furious that you weren't paying attention.</v>

4606
02:13:51.170 --> 02:13:52.410
<v Speaker 1>You got to watch two year olds,</v>

4607
02:13:52.411 --> 02:13:54.840
<v Speaker 1>like you gotta be right there with them all the time.</v>

4608
02:13:55.560 --> 02:13:56.280

4609
02:13:56.280 --> 02:13:57.270
<v Speaker 1>he was six it said.</v>

4610
02:13:57.720 --> 02:13:58.380

4611
02:13:58.380 --> 02:13:58.861
<v Speaker 1>What do I think?</v>

4612

02:14:00.690 --> 02:14:01.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4615
02:14:01.180 --> 02:14:01.610

<v Speaker 1>they actually,</v>

4621
02:14:03.750 --> 02:14:05.970
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you have to watch them even more because they get real cocky.</v>

4622
02:14:05.971 --> 02:14:08.730
<v Speaker 1>Six year olds in a big mansion with a banister staircase.</v>

4623
02:14:09.210 --> 02:14:09.541
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4625
02:14:10.470 --> 02:14:12.450
<v Speaker 1>you have to fucking pay attention to them.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4630
02:14:14.821 --> 02:14:16.080
<v Speaker 1>we don't know what happened with the kid.</v>

4631
02:14:16.081 --> 02:14:17.100
<v Speaker 1>We don't know what happened to her.</v>

4632
02:14:17.110 --> 02:14:19.020
<v Speaker 1>There might've been some weird shit with him or her.</v>

4633
02:14:21.050 --> 02:14:21.650
<v Speaker 11>Okay.</v>

4634

<v Speaker 1>from a balcony at the famous speckled mansion Coronado.</v>

4637
02:14:31.910 --> 02:14:35.900
<v Speaker 1>A cryptic message written in black paint was found just outside the second story</v>

4638
02:14:35.901 --> 02:14:36.531
<v Speaker 1>room in the house.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's been amended to allege new details.</v>

4670
02:15:31.330 --> 02:15:36.330
<v Speaker 1>About three people conspired to kill her being gay and strangling her with the</v>

4671
02:15:36.401 --> 02:15:36.971
<v Speaker 1>autopsy.</v>

4672
02:15:36.971 --> 02:15:37.770
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>

02:15:37.770 --> 02:15:39.370
<v Speaker 1>it couldn't have been a suicide.</v>

4674
02:15:39.820 --> 02:15:40.653
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

4675
02:15:40.860 --> 02:15:42.520
<v Speaker 1>They found marks on her body.</v>

4676
02:15:44.260 --> 02:15:45.220
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

4677
02:15:46.830 --> 02:15:47.663
<v Speaker 11>Okay,</v>

4678
02:15:48.940 --> 02:15:50.680
<v Speaker 1>well who knows,</v>

4679
02:15:50.770 --> 02:15:51.490
<v Speaker 1>who knows?</v>

4680
02:15:51.490 --> 02:15:52.600
<v Speaker 1>She might have been evil.</v>

4681
02:15:52.601 --> 02:15:53.920
<v Speaker 1>She might've killed the kid.</v>

4682
02:15:54.370 --> 02:15:57.190
<v Speaker 1>They might have killed her accident.</v>

4683
02:15:57.850 --> 02:15:58.361
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

4684
02:15:58.361 --> 02:16:00.310
<v Speaker 1>But I mean if they found her hanging,</v>

4685
02:16:00.900 --> 02:16:02.440
<v Speaker 1>if they really did find her hanging,</v>

4686
02:16:02.441 --> 02:16:03.340
<v Speaker 1>like it says there,</v>

4687
02:16:03.610 --> 02:16:07.600
<v Speaker 1>the document goes on to claim that the trios trucks out on the head multiple</v>

4688
02:16:07.601 --> 02:16:07.871
<v Speaker 1>times,</v>

4689
02:16:07.871 --> 02:16:10.000
<v Speaker 1>the blunt instrument physically restrained,</v>

4690
02:16:10.001 --> 02:16:10.930
<v Speaker 1>her gagged her,</v>

4691
02:16:11.050 --> 02:16:15.040
<v Speaker 1>bound her and strangled her to the point of unconsciousness or death.</v>

4692
02:16:17.180 --> 02:16:18.013
<v Speaker 11>Huh?</v>

4693
02:16:19.030 --> 02:16:19.810
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno,</v>

4694
02:16:19.810 --> 02:16:20.710
<v Speaker 1>I don't even want to know.</v>

4695
02:16:20.880 --> 02:16:24.760
<v Speaker 1>It's creepy from a lawsuit that this is all coming from to not like an official</v>

4696
02:16:25.150 --> 02:16:25.900
<v Speaker 1>police ruling.</v>

4697
02:16:25.900 --> 02:16:26.350
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4698
02:16:26.350 --> 02:16:27.850
<v Speaker 1>So this is just their claims.</v>

4699
02:16:28.210 --> 02:16:29.043
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it is?</v>

4700
02:16:29.440 --> 02:16:30.450
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what this project,</v>

4701
02:16:30.470 --> 02:16:32.040
<v Speaker 1>I know what opened again,</v>

4702
02:16:32.440 --> 02:16:35.380
<v Speaker 1>probably some people that at one point in time are madly in love.</v>

4703
02:16:35.590 --> 02:16:36.520
<v Speaker 1>They loved each other,</v>

4704
02:16:36.521 --> 02:16:36.941
<v Speaker 1>asked her,</v>

4705
02:16:36.941 --> 02:16:38.980
<v Speaker 1>they wanted to be together forever and ever and ever.</v>

4706
02:16:38.981 --> 02:16:39.731
<v Speaker 1>I love you.</v>

4707
02:16:39.731 --> 02:16:40.630
<v Speaker 1>I love you.</v>

4708
02:16:40.631 --> 02:16:41.464
<v Speaker 1>I hug you.</v>

4709
02:16:41.730 --> 02:16:45.070
<v Speaker 4>How do you know who's who's going to kill?</v>

4710
02:16:45.071 --> 02:16:45.850
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

4711
02:16:45.850 --> 02:16:47.380
<v Speaker 4>Like these people,</v>

4712
02:16:47.650 --> 02:16:48.370
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

4713
02:16:48.370 --> 02:16:49.180
<v Speaker 4>they weren't,</v>

4714
02:16:49.180 --> 02:16:50.590
<v Speaker 4>they didn't pick up on the red flags.</v>

4715
02:16:50.591 --> 02:16:51.850
<v Speaker 4>If there were any,</v>

4716
02:16:52.480 --> 02:16:52.990
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

4717
02:16:52.990 --> 02:16:57.160
<v Speaker 1>there might be no indication up until the point where that kid died.</v>

4718
02:16:57.370 --> 02:16:57.731
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4719
02:16:57.731 --> 02:17:01.090
<v Speaker 1>the kid dying might've been like this fucking dumb bitch.</v>

4720
02:17:01.360 --> 02:17:01.631
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4721
02:17:01.631 --> 02:17:04.330
<v Speaker 1>I might've been like the straw that broke the camel's back.</v>

4722
02:17:04.540 --> 02:17:05.021
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4723
02:17:05.021 --> 02:17:05.071
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

4724
02:17:05.071 --> 02:17:06.370
<v Speaker 1>if they did murder her,</v>

4725
02:17:06.580 --> 02:17:08.320
<v Speaker 1>that might be what or who knows?</v>

4726
02:17:08.321 --> 02:17:09.550
<v Speaker 1>She might be evil.</v>

4727
02:17:09.700 --> 02:17:09.971
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4728
02:17:09.971 --> 02:17:13.320
<v Speaker 1>she might've been just a horrible person and they might have hated her already.</v>

4729
02:17:13.330 --> 02:17:14.650
<v Speaker 1>And then when she killed the kid,</v>

4730
02:17:14.651 --> 02:17:15.640
<v Speaker 1>she might have pushed the kid.</v>

4731
02:17:15.641 --> 02:17:16.474
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>

4732
02:17:16.570 --> 02:17:17.740
<v Speaker 1>People are assholes.</v>

4733
02:17:17.980 --> 02:17:19.960
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of creepy fucks out there in this world.</v>

4734
02:17:20.050 --> 02:17:22.350
<v Speaker 4>Maybe she kills him that true kind of like,</v>

4735
02:17:22.680 --> 02:17:23.011
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4736
02:17:23.011 --> 02:17:23.280
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

4737
02:17:23.280 --> 02:17:24.730
<v Speaker 4>you would think that she didn't,</v>

4738
02:17:24.750 --> 02:17:26.640
<v Speaker 4>I would like to think it was an accident.</v>

4739
02:17:26.730 --> 02:17:26.971
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4740
02:17:26.971 --> 02:17:28.560
<v Speaker 1>I would like to think that both of them were an accident.</v>

4741
02:17:28.630 --> 02:17:28.990
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

4742
02:17:28.990 --> 02:17:30.750
<v Speaker 1>the civil suit is just frivolous,</v>

4743
02:17:31.670 --> 02:17:33.620
<v Speaker 4>but you never know.</v>

4744
02:17:33.810 --> 02:17:34.061
<v Speaker 3>Of course.</v>

4751
02:17:43.631 --> 02:17:44.260

02:17:45.521 --> 02:17:47.160
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to know if we should show it on here.</v>

4755
02:17:47.340 --> 02:17:48.670

02:17:51.270 --> 02:17:52.090

4762
02:17:52.810 --> 02:17:53.350
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4763
02:17:53.350 --> 02:17:56.560
<v Speaker 3>somebody put a posted this last night and it's one of these videos I had</v>

4764
02:17:56.950 --> 02:18:01.120
<v Speaker 3>something to do about a kid in a little kid in a swimming pool and this little</v>

4765
02:18:01.121 --> 02:18:02.650
<v Speaker 3>kid falls in the swimming pool,</v>

4766
02:18:02.680 --> 02:18:04.000
<v Speaker 3>but it has been trained,</v>

4767
02:18:04.450 --> 02:18:05.283
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4768
02:18:05.590 --> 02:18:05.981
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

4769
02:18:05.981 --> 02:18:06.370
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4770
02:18:06.370 --> 02:18:07.150
<v Speaker 3>survive.</v>

4771
02:18:07.150 --> 02:18:09.670
<v Speaker 3>And this kid is like a baby can't even talk.</v>

4772
02:18:09.940 --> 02:18:10.351
<v Speaker 3>And so it's,</v>

4773
02:18:10.351 --> 02:18:11.440
<v Speaker 3>it shows this little baby.</v>

4774
02:18:11.441 --> 02:18:12.101
<v Speaker 3>And at first you're like,</v>

4775
02:18:12.101 --> 02:18:13.600
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck is going on?</v>

4776
02:18:13.900 --> 02:18:18.330
<v Speaker 3>This baby falls in the pool and then the baby just learned how to float and just</v>

4777
02:18:18.340 --> 02:18:22.750
<v Speaker 3>sitting there going and it is the creepiest coolest video.</v>

4778
02:18:22.920 --> 02:18:23.030
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

4779
02:18:23.030 --> 02:18:24.190
<v Speaker 3>babies are really fat.</v>

4780
02:18:24.220 --> 02:18:25.360
<v Speaker 3>They can float pretty good.</v>

4781
02:18:25.400 --> 02:18:26.020
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4782
02:18:26.020 --> 02:18:26.540
<v Speaker 3>Awesome.</v>

4783
02:18:26.540 --> 02:18:27.260
<v Speaker 3>It didn't pan out.</v>

4784
02:18:27.260 --> 02:18:27.500
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4785
02:18:27.500 --> 02:18:28.480
<v Speaker 3>But when you see this video,</v>

4786
02:18:28.481 --> 02:18:31.300
<v Speaker 3>it's one of the most interesting videos to watch because it's,</v>

4787
02:18:31.360 --> 02:18:35.170
<v Speaker 3>it's something you don't want to see mixed with the baby knowing what it's</v>

4788
02:18:35.171 --> 02:18:35.800
<v Speaker 3>doing.</v>

4789
02:18:35.800 --> 02:18:38.440
<v Speaker 3>So it has this really uneasy feel to it.</v>

4790
02:18:38.620 --> 02:18:41.890
<v Speaker 3>Here's the baby walking out and has great sound on it also.</v>

4791
02:18:41.891 --> 02:18:42.550
<v Speaker 3>If,</v>

4792
02:18:42.550 --> 02:18:43.990
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

4793
02:18:44.020 --> 02:18:44.950
<v Speaker 3>but it's uh,</v>

4794
02:18:45.160 --> 02:18:46.270
<v Speaker 3>so they did this on purpose.</v>

4795
02:18:46.271 --> 02:18:48.970
<v Speaker 3>They made this video on purpose just to show that the baby can do,</v>

4796
02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:49.151
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

4797
02:18:49.151 --> 02:18:50.170
<v Speaker 3>I can show this baby.</v>

4798
02:18:50.171 --> 02:18:51.490
<v Speaker 3>He's a baby now.</v>

4799
02:18:51.491 --> 02:18:53.410
<v Speaker 3>This is not even a two year old watch.</v>

4800
02:18:53.411 --> 02:18:54.820
<v Speaker 3>This is a little tiny toddler.</v>

4801
02:18:55.270 --> 02:18:57.250
<v Speaker 3>And who's recording this?</v>

4802
02:18:57.310 --> 02:18:58.440
<v Speaker 3>There's the,</v>

4803
02:18:58.480 --> 02:19:00.850
<v Speaker 3>the dads are recording this and watch,</v>

4804
02:19:00.910 --> 02:19:02.500
<v Speaker 3>this is where the baby falls in.</v>

4805
02:19:03.800 --> 02:19:04.240
<v Speaker 12>Okay.</v>

4806
02:19:04.240 --> 02:19:05.330
<v Speaker 4>Like this baby's done this</v>

4807
02:19:05.400 --> 02:19:06.070
<v Speaker 1>before the baby,</v>

4808
02:19:06.070 --> 02:19:06.340
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4809
02:19:06.340 --> 02:19:06.630
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4810
02:19:06.630 --> 02:19:07.610
<v Speaker 1>Jumped in the water</v>

4811
02:19:07.710 --> 02:19:08.311
<v Speaker 3>kicks.</v>

4812
02:19:08.311 --> 02:19:09.330
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

4813
02:19:09.480 --> 02:19:11.100
<v Speaker 3>Amazing flopping around.</v>

4814
02:19:11.340 --> 02:19:13.470
<v Speaker 3>And then it's up to the surface and then watch.</v>

4815
02:19:15.140 --> 02:19:15.973
<v Speaker 1>Just relaxing.</v>

4816
02:19:16.610 --> 02:19:17.070

4821
02:19:21.090 --> 02:19:21.331
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

4822
02:19:21.331 --> 02:19:22.830
<v Speaker 3>I think this is just this little pajamas.</v>

4823

<v Speaker 1>It's Kinda fucked it.</v>

4831
02:19:34.131 --> 02:19:35.660
<v Speaker 1>They leave them there like this for this long.</v>

4832
02:19:36.440 --> 02:19:37.310
<v Speaker 1>I get the video,</v>

4833
02:19:37.311 --> 02:19:37.671

4836
02:19:40.821 --> 02:19:43.070
<v Speaker 1>This goes on for another minute.</v>

4837
02:19:45.170 --> 02:19:46.003
<v Speaker 1>Cut it off.</v>

4838
02:19:46.170 --> 02:19:47.030
<v Speaker 1>If you cut to the very end,</v>

4839
02:19:47.031 --> 02:19:48.330
<v Speaker 1>you could see where the bay,</v>

4840
02:19:48.400 --> 02:19:49.970
<v Speaker 1>look how it's really cute baby.</v>

4841
02:19:49.971 --> 02:19:53.540
<v Speaker 1>When the guy grabs it at the very end of the video.</v>

4842
02:19:53.970 --> 02:19:54.540
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

4843
02:19:54.540 --> 02:19:55.120
<v Speaker 1>let's see.</v>

4844
02:19:55.120 --> 02:19:58.460
<v Speaker 1>And it's just happy as can be.</v>

4845
02:19:58.480 --> 02:19:59.313
<v Speaker 1>He's laughing.</v>

4846
02:20:00.320 --> 02:20:01.790
<v Speaker 1>I said that was interesting and creepy,</v>

4847
02:20:01.880 --> 02:20:02.840
<v Speaker 1>but it is interesting.</v>

4848
02:20:02.870 --> 02:20:04.880
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if it's a suit or if it's a,</v>

4849
02:20:04.881 --> 02:20:07.820
<v Speaker 1>they just taught the kid the line is back and they just naturally float.</v>

4850
02:20:08.030 --> 02:20:09.500
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of is probably they panic,</v>

4851
02:20:09.501 --> 02:20:10.334
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4852
02:20:10.750 --> 02:20:12.110
<v Speaker 1>they don't even need a bathing suit.</v>

4853
02:20:13.780 --> 02:20:15.390
<v Speaker 1>It was like awesome.</v>

4854
02:20:16.600 --> 02:20:17.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>their underwear in the pool.</v>

4903
02:21:39.320 --> 02:21:39.501

4906
02:21:42.290 --> 02:21:43.580
<v Speaker 1>Whenever I think about the fact that,</v>

<v Speaker 1>people drunk at the pool.</v>

4910
02:21:47.061 --> 02:21:48.680

<v Speaker 1>It's the craziest shit ever.</v>

4913
02:21:51.050 --> 02:21:52.150

02:22:06.050 --> 02:22:09.740
<v Speaker 1>young studs and twinks and they just fill a pool.</v>

4924
02:22:10.240 --> 02:22:11.001

<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

5093
02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:53.010
<v Speaker 4>but it's cool when people can admit that.</v>

5094
02:25:53.320 --> 02:25:54.160
<v Speaker 2>Do people say that to you?</v>

<v Speaker 4>Or like,</v>

5106
02:26:07.870 --> 02:26:11.860
<v Speaker 4>or because I picked on somebody because they picked on somebody in the audience.</v>

5107
02:26:11.920 --> 02:26:12.910
<v Speaker 4>That's why they hated you.</v>

5108
02:26:12.940 --> 02:26:13.840
<v Speaker 4>They'll hate me.</v>

5109

02:26:16.351 --> 02:26:17.320
<v Speaker 2>if you were picking on someone,</v>

5115
02:26:17.321 --> 02:26:18.580
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't imagine being vicious.</v>

5116
02:26:18.780 --> 02:26:19.960
<v Speaker 2>You're not a vicious person.</v>

5117
02:26:21.250 --> 02:26:23.170
<v Speaker 2>So you think are very vicious.</v>

02:26:24.220 --> 02:26:26.980
<v Speaker 4>I can be vicious on stage into the microphone.</v>

5120
02:26:26.981 --> 02:26:27.430
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5124
02:26:31.031 --> 02:26:31.690
<v Speaker 4>Is that what it is?</v>

5125
02:26:31.690 --> 02:26:31.901
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

5126
02:26:31.901 --> 02:26:32.650

<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5128
02:26:33.101 --> 02:26:37.300
<v Speaker 4>it's just easy to make fun of guys who are alone in a comedy club when everybody</v>

5129
02:26:37.301 --> 02:26:38.790
<v Speaker 4>else is in a couple in,</v>

<v Speaker 4>in a relationship.</v>

5131
02:26:40.280 --> 02:26:42.030
<v Speaker 2>How ironic that you make fun of those guys,</v>

5132
02:26:42.190 --> 02:26:43.820
<v Speaker 2>those the ones that would rape you and kill you.</v>

5133
02:26:44.250 --> 02:26:45.280
<v Speaker 2>It's weird.</v>

5139
02:26:52.320 --> 02:26:52.700
<v Speaker 4>Ah.</v>

5140
02:26:52.700 --> 02:26:55.980
<v Speaker 4>It's like sometimes the ones who are by themselves,</v>

5141
02:26:56.670 --> 02:26:57.570
<v Speaker 4>we'll get creepy.</v>

<v Speaker 1>to recover from an injury.</v>

5288
02:31:05.690 --> 02:31:06.550
<v Speaker 1>I fix all that other,</v>

5289
02:31:06.600 --> 02:31:08.570
<v Speaker 1>I go to doctors get the injections,</v>

5290
02:31:11.720 --> 02:31:13.700
<v Speaker 1>steroid injections don't really fix things.</v>

5291
02:31:14.150 --> 02:31:14.330
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

5292
02:31:14.330 --> 02:31:18.200
<v Speaker 1>steroids can fixing cortisone mostly.</v>

5293
02:31:18.230 --> 02:31:18.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5294
02:31:18.830 --> 02:31:19.830
<v Speaker 1>that's a little bit different</v>

5295
02:31:20.100 --> 02:31:23.160
<v Speaker 6>that that would really does with a cortisone shot does,</v>

5296
02:31:23.161 --> 02:31:24.540
<v Speaker 6>is really just numbs the pain.</v>

5297
02:31:24.990 --> 02:31:28.800
<v Speaker 6>It actually can become more problematic for people that have injuries because</v>

5298
02:31:28.801 --> 02:31:31.510
<v Speaker 6>you get a cortisone shot in your knee or in a,</v>

5299
02:31:31.520 --> 02:31:31.860
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5300
02:31:31.860 --> 02:31:33.180
<v Speaker 6>your joints or something like that.</v>

5301
02:31:33.181 --> 02:31:35.280
<v Speaker 6>And then while you're working out,</v>

5302
02:31:35.310 --> 02:31:36.270
<v Speaker 6>you're not feeling any pain.</v>

5303
02:31:36.271 --> 02:31:37.440
<v Speaker 6>We were still doing injury.</v>

5304
02:31:37.560 --> 02:31:40.680
<v Speaker 6>You're still grinding on an injury and you can actually like Bas Rutten,</v>

5305
02:31:40.681 --> 02:31:44.910
<v Speaker 6>he's all fucked up cause he got cortisone shots in his knees and cortisone shots</v>

5306
02:31:44.911 --> 02:31:46.740
<v Speaker 6>in his elbows and he kept fighting,</v>

5307
02:31:47.070 --> 02:31:47.401
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5308
02:31:47.401 --> 02:31:50.490
<v Speaker 6>like he had all this pain and so we just get cortisone shots and now it's just</v>

5309
02:31:50.610 --> 02:31:54.000
<v Speaker 6>joints are destroyed and he just like was too tough for,</v>

5310
02:31:54.001 --> 02:31:55.080
<v Speaker 6>for his own body.</v>

5311
02:31:55.350 --> 02:31:57.090
<v Speaker 6>But I got a stem cell injection.</v>

5312
02:31:57.330 --> 02:31:58.710
<v Speaker 6>I got one recently had,</v>

5313
02:31:58.740 --> 02:32:02.970
<v Speaker 6>I was worried that I was going to have to get shoulder surgery from a woman's</v>

5314
02:32:02.971 --> 02:32:03.804
<v Speaker 6>placenta.</v>

5315
02:32:03.850 --> 02:32:04.830
<v Speaker 6>Oh my God.</v>

5316
02:32:05.220 --> 02:32:05.761
<v Speaker 6>Total.</v>

5317
02:32:05.761 --> 02:32:06.930
<v Speaker 6>You mean next level?</v>

5318
02:32:06.931 --> 02:32:07.764
<v Speaker 6>Shit.</v>

5319
02:32:08.300 --> 02:32:12.150
<v Speaker 6>There's a company that collects women's stem cells from their menstrual blood</v>

5320
02:32:12.180 --> 02:32:15.240
<v Speaker 6>and stores planned parenthood's cause supposedly cells,</v>

5321
02:32:15.270 --> 02:32:18.090
<v Speaker 6>they aborted stem cells and makes money off of that.</v>

5322
02:32:18.091 --> 02:32:19.380
<v Speaker 6>But that might be abortion talk.</v>

5323
02:32:19.650 --> 02:32:20.230
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

5324
02:32:20.230 --> 02:32:21.960
<v Speaker 6>I'm pretty sure that's not,</v>

5325
02:32:22.020 --> 02:32:23.910
<v Speaker 6>it seems like it should be bullshit,</v>

5326
02:32:23.911 --> 02:32:26.550
<v Speaker 6>but I'm pretty sure there's like a real investigation into that.</v>

5327
02:32:26.551 --> 02:32:27.090
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

5328
02:32:27.090 --> 02:32:27.331
<v Speaker 6>look,</v>

5329
02:32:27.331 --> 02:32:27.750
<v Speaker 6>it could,</v>

5330
02:32:27.750 --> 02:32:28.920
<v Speaker 6>it could happen because look,</v>

5331
02:32:28.921 --> 02:32:33.720
<v Speaker 6>the d the cells are viable and the idea of not using them to me is more fucked</v>

5332
02:32:33.721 --> 02:32:34.710
<v Speaker 6>up than using them.</v>

5333
02:32:35.040 --> 02:32:35.311
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

5334
02:32:35.311 --> 02:32:36.630
<v Speaker 6>if you're going to end board a fetus,</v>

5335
02:32:36.631 --> 02:32:38.430
<v Speaker 6>shouldn't you at least use those cells?</v>

5336
02:32:38.431 --> 02:32:39.720
<v Speaker 6>Cycle it use every part.</v>

5337
02:32:39.721 --> 02:32:42.240
<v Speaker 6>But people were worried that people going to have abortions on purpose to make</v>

5338
02:32:42.241 --> 02:32:43.740
<v Speaker 6>money for the stem cells.</v>

5339
02:32:44.430 --> 02:32:44.850
<v Speaker 6>But anyway,</v>

5340
02:32:44.850 --> 02:32:46.900
<v Speaker 6>what they do is when a woman has a csection,</v>

5341
02:32:47.100 --> 02:32:51.360
<v Speaker 6>they take the placenta from the c section and they use it to,</v>

5342
02:32:51.390 --> 02:32:51.770
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

5343
02:32:51.770 --> 02:32:51.950
<v Speaker 6>they,</v>

5344
02:32:51.950 --> 02:32:53.460
<v Speaker 6>they harvest the stem cells from this,</v>

5345
02:32:53.461 --> 02:32:56.310
<v Speaker 6>they freeze it and then they thought out and injected into your injury.</v>

5346
02:32:56.550 --> 02:33:00.090
<v Speaker 6>And I had a shoulder that was fucking with me for like a year,</v>

5347
02:33:00.120 --> 02:33:00.990
<v Speaker 6>like a solid year.</v>

5348
02:33:00.991 --> 02:33:01.591
<v Speaker 6>I'd work out,</v>

5349
02:33:01.591 --> 02:33:02.460
<v Speaker 6>it would get swollen.</v>

5350
02:33:02.670 --> 02:33:03.990
<v Speaker 6>I said it would get better,</v>

5351
02:33:03.991 --> 02:33:06.660
<v Speaker 6>but it never totally got better and I could do most things,</v>

5352
02:33:06.810 --> 02:33:07.860
<v Speaker 6>but it was always in pain.</v>

5353
02:33:08.250 --> 02:33:11.820
<v Speaker 6>I got the stem cell injection two and a half weeks ago cause I was worried that</v>

5354
02:33:11.821 --> 02:33:13.050
<v Speaker 6>I was going to have to get surgery.</v>

5355
02:33:13.200 --> 02:33:14.210
<v Speaker 6>I had one doctor had said,</v>

5356
02:33:14.230 --> 02:33:15.060
<v Speaker 6>get surgery.</v>

5357
02:33:15.060 --> 02:33:15.271
<v Speaker 6>He's like,</v>

5358
02:33:15.271 --> 02:33:16.140
<v Speaker 6>you're probably gonna need surgery.</v>

5359
02:33:16.141 --> 02:33:17.130
<v Speaker 6>And then another doctor said,</v>

5360
02:33:17.580 --> 02:33:19.110
<v Speaker 6>I'm went to an actual orthopedic surgeon.</v>

5361
02:33:19.111 --> 02:33:19.501
<v Speaker 6>He was like,</v>

5362
02:33:19.501 --> 02:33:19.800
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

5363
02:33:19.800 --> 02:33:20.940
<v Speaker 6>you have too much function,</v>

5364
02:33:21.420 --> 02:33:22.290
<v Speaker 6>moves it too much.</v>

5365
02:33:22.560 --> 02:33:25.080
<v Speaker 6>Let's just try to rehab it and see like if those tears,</v>

5366
02:33:25.081 --> 02:33:25.501
<v Speaker 6>if they'll,</v>

5367
02:33:25.501 --> 02:33:26.334
<v Speaker 6>they'll heal up.</v>

5368
02:33:26.430 --> 02:33:28.890
<v Speaker 6>I got the stem cell shot within two and a half weeks.</v>

5369
02:33:29.190 --> 02:33:30.780
<v Speaker 6>It feels like there's nothing wrong with my shoulder.</v>

5370
02:33:30.960 --> 02:33:32.340
<v Speaker 6>It's fucking crazy.</v>

5371
02:33:32.550 --> 02:33:36.000
<v Speaker 6>It's crazy because it's supposed to last like it's supposed to be like six to</v>

5372
02:33:36.001 --> 02:33:38.220
<v Speaker 6>eight weeks to when you say you feel the real impact.</v>

5373
02:33:38.440 --> 02:33:39.710
<v Speaker 6>And then I talked to Daniel Cormier,</v>

5374
02:33:39.790 --> 02:33:40.441
<v Speaker 6>Daniel Cormier,</v>

5375
02:33:40.441 --> 02:33:41.700
<v Speaker 6>the UFC light heavyweight champ.</v>

5376
02:33:42.030 --> 02:33:45.060
<v Speaker 6>He had a knee injury and his knee was fucked up and he was thinking about</v>

5377
02:33:45.061 --> 02:33:46.680
<v Speaker 6>getting surgery and he was putting it off.</v>

5378
02:33:46.681 --> 02:33:48.120
<v Speaker 6>And I talked to him a year ago about this.</v>

5379
02:33:48.420 --> 02:33:48.691
<v Speaker 6>He's like,</v>

5380
02:33:48.691 --> 02:33:49.524
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>

5381
02:33:49.940 --> 02:33:50.250
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

5382
02:33:50.250 --> 02:33:51.610
<v Speaker 6>eventually when we get surgery I think,</v>

5383
02:33:51.611 --> 02:33:52.444
<v Speaker 6>and I'm trying to put it off,</v>

5384
02:33:52.470 --> 02:33:53.490
<v Speaker 6>he got the stem cells,</v>

5385
02:33:53.610 --> 02:33:54.443
<v Speaker 6>Bam.</v>

5386
02:33:54.450 --> 02:33:55.261
<v Speaker 6>All of a sudden he's like,</v>

5387
02:33:55.261 --> 02:33:56.071
<v Speaker 6>it's amazing.</v>

5388
02:33:56.071 --> 02:33:57.660
<v Speaker 6>It's like right away it felt better.</v>

5389
02:33:57.740 --> 02:33:58.170
<v Speaker 6>They feel,</v>

5390
02:33:58.170 --> 02:34:00.150
<v Speaker 6>and I don't know who it was,</v>

5391
02:34:00.300 --> 02:34:01.133
<v Speaker 6>but did I give her a hug?</v>

5392
02:34:01.510 --> 02:34:02.880
<v Speaker 6>Tell her they don't tell you.</v>

5393
02:34:02.970 --> 02:34:03.481
<v Speaker 6>Oh No,</v>

5394
02:34:03.481 --> 02:34:03.631
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

5395
02:34:03.631 --> 02:34:06.540
<v Speaker 6>they definitely don't tell you because that woman's stem cells probably went to</v>

5396
02:34:06.541 --> 02:34:11.010
<v Speaker 6>untold numbers of people cause it's a small amount of the amount that they had</v>

5397
02:34:11.011 --> 02:34:11.630
<v Speaker 6>in this little,</v>

5398
02:34:11.630 --> 02:34:13.320
<v Speaker 6>in this little syringe,</v>

5399
02:34:13.321 --> 02:34:14.111
<v Speaker 6>when they inject it in,</v>

5400
02:34:14.111 --> 02:34:16.420
<v Speaker 6>you kind of connected to her in some way.</v>

5401
02:34:16.620 --> 02:34:18.130
<v Speaker 6>It's somewhere starting</v>

5402
02:34:18.130 --> 02:34:19.210
<v Speaker 1>your period and your neck.</v>

5403
02:34:19.270 --> 02:34:19.421
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

5404
02:34:19.421 --> 02:34:20.201
<v Speaker 1>I have some other stuff.</v>

5405
02:34:20.201 --> 02:34:21.070
<v Speaker 1>I have a cadaver,</v>

5406
02:34:21.390 --> 02:34:22.210
<v Speaker 1>a joint.</v>

5407
02:34:22.210 --> 02:34:22.560
<v Speaker 1>I have,</v>

5408
02:34:22.560 --> 02:34:23.080
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

5409
02:34:23.080 --> 02:34:25.000
<v Speaker 1>my left knee has a cadaver.</v>

5410
02:34:25.030 --> 02:34:25.360
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

5411
02:34:25.360 --> 02:34:25.990
<v Speaker 1>my right knee.</v>

5412
02:34:25.990 --> 02:34:28.000
<v Speaker 1>My right knee has a cadaver ACL.</v>

5413
02:34:28.030 --> 02:34:29.500
<v Speaker 1>It's extra a cadavers,</v>

5414
02:34:29.860 --> 02:34:30.693
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

5415
02:34:30.760 --> 02:34:31.091
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5416
02:34:31.091 --> 02:34:35.710
<v Speaker 1>Achilles tendon cause Achilles tendon as much fatter than a human ACL.</v>

5417
02:34:36.130 --> 02:34:38.170
<v Speaker 1>And so they take this kid Achilles tendon,</v>

5418
02:34:38.171 --> 02:34:38.801
<v Speaker 1>they open you up,</v>

5419
02:34:38.801 --> 02:34:39.640
<v Speaker 1>they put it in place,</v>

5420
02:34:39.641 --> 02:34:40.090
<v Speaker 1>screw it,</v>

5421
02:34:40.090 --> 02:34:40.923
<v Speaker 1>screw it down.</v>

5422
02:34:41.140 --> 02:34:46.140
<v Speaker 1>And then your body repopulates this cadaver the dead person's Achilles tendon.</v>

5423
02:34:46.481 --> 02:34:49.030
<v Speaker 1>So it's much thicker than a regular ACL.</v>

5424
02:34:49.300 --> 02:34:54.300
<v Speaker 1>So my ACL and my right knee is like 150% stronger than a regular ACL because it</v>

5425
02:34:54.731 --> 02:34:55.330
<v Speaker 1>was an a,</v>

5426
02:34:55.330 --> 02:34:56.890
<v Speaker 1>an ACL from an Achilles tendon.</v>

5427
02:34:57.570 --> 02:34:59.620
<v Speaker 1>Do you have two new inner voices that are new,</v>

5428
02:35:00.940 --> 02:35:01.600
<v Speaker 1>new inner voice?</v>

5429
02:35:01.600 --> 02:35:02.620
<v Speaker 1>I think that might be my problem.</v>

5430
02:35:03.470 --> 02:35:04.840
<v Speaker 1>Too much dead people,</v>

5431
02:35:04.841 --> 02:35:06.090
<v Speaker 1>parts and baby farms.</v>

5432
02:35:06.310 --> 02:35:08.230
<v Speaker 1>You have a girl's voice in a guy's voice,</v>

5433
02:35:08.710 --> 02:35:12.190
<v Speaker 1>but I'll tell you that growing baby teeth on your shoulder and we'll pull them</v>

5434
02:35:12.191 --> 02:35:12.550
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

5435
02:35:12.550 --> 02:35:13.750
<v Speaker 1>The fucking pair of pliers.</v>

5436
02:35:13.790 --> 02:35:14.623
<v Speaker 1>And I'm a man.</v>

5437
02:35:14.840 --> 02:35:15.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm no,</v>

5438
02:35:15.440 --> 02:35:17.140
<v Speaker 1>it looks as long as it fixes my shoulder.</v>

5439
02:35:17.141 --> 02:35:21.460
<v Speaker 1>And right now if my shoulder does not get any better and stays right here and</v>

5440
02:35:21.461 --> 02:35:22.271
<v Speaker 1>doesn't get any worse,</v>

5441
02:35:22.271 --> 02:35:25.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm fucking super happy because there's no pain right now.</v>

5442
02:35:25.300 --> 02:35:26.133
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm,</v>

5443
02:35:26.580 --> 02:35:26.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>

5444
02:35:26.950 --> 02:35:30.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm not feeling any pain and I'm still doing all these rehab exercises so it's</v>

5445
02:35:30.431 --> 02:35:31.091
<v Speaker 1>all strong.</v>

5446
02:35:31.091 --> 02:35:32.080
<v Speaker 1>I can do things with it.</v>

5447
02:35:32.500 --> 02:35:33.760
<v Speaker 1>I might be able to avoid surgery.</v>

5448
02:35:33.790 --> 02:35:35.500
<v Speaker 1>I think there's just some tears in there,</v>

5449
02:35:35.501 --> 02:35:36.800
<v Speaker 1>but I'm pretty sure they're healing up.</v>

5450
02:35:36.801 --> 02:35:37.960
<v Speaker 1>Psalms going on in there.</v>

5451
02:35:37.990 --> 02:35:38.630
<v Speaker 1>It's great.</v>

5452
02:35:38.630 --> 02:35:40.350
<v Speaker 1>Some new next level shit happening.</v>

5453
02:35:40.360 --> 02:35:45.360
<v Speaker 1>But those lenses that can make you see way better than 2020 stem cell injections</v>

5454
02:35:45.461 --> 02:35:46.294
<v Speaker 1>when you have injuries.</v>

5455
02:35:46.390 --> 02:35:47.171
<v Speaker 1>I've never had anything.</v>

5456
02:35:47.171 --> 02:35:49.120
<v Speaker 1>He'll up this quick cause it's crazy.</v>

5457
02:35:49.121 --> 02:35:52.450
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of spooky because this thing was fucking with me for a long time,</v>

5458
02:35:52.451 --> 02:35:52.751
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

5459
02:35:52.751 --> 02:35:53.291
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

5460
02:35:53.291 --> 02:35:54.670
<v Speaker 1>When women have their periods,</v>

5461
02:35:54.671 --> 02:35:57.760
<v Speaker 1>we lose all our stem cells from the uterus lining.</v>

5462
02:35:57.910 --> 02:36:02.910
<v Speaker 1>They should collect it and store it and use it for when you need a stem cell for</v>

5463
02:36:03.070 --> 02:36:03.790
<v Speaker 1>your neck.</v>

5464
02:36:03.790 --> 02:36:04.840
<v Speaker 1>I think they're doing it.</v>

5465
02:36:04.841 --> 02:36:05.680
<v Speaker 1>I think they're doing that.</v>

5466
02:36:06.070 --> 02:36:07.480
<v Speaker 1>This company went bankrupt.</v>

5467
02:36:07.810 --> 02:36:08.501
<v Speaker 1>We're not bankrupt,</v>

5468
02:36:08.501 --> 02:36:10.570
<v Speaker 1>but they said enough people didn't get it.</v>

5469
02:36:10.571 --> 02:36:12.670
<v Speaker 1>So they're not collecting menstrual blood anymore,</v>

5470
02:36:12.730 --> 02:36:14.320
<v Speaker 1>but you know they do them from your own fat.</v>

5471
02:36:14.440 --> 02:36:15.400
<v Speaker 1>So here's a win.</v>

5472
02:36:15.401 --> 02:36:17.920
<v Speaker 1>When they take the fat out of your love handles,</v>

5473
02:36:17.921 --> 02:36:19.900
<v Speaker 1>they light Bo you and they take your faith.</v>

5474
02:36:20.440 --> 02:36:21.710
<v Speaker 1>You don't need any lipid hooker.</v>

5475
02:36:21.780 --> 02:36:22.240
<v Speaker 1>We talk.</v>

5476
02:36:22.240 --> 02:36:22.480
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

5477
02:36:22.480 --> 02:36:23.313
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

5478
02:36:23.460 --> 02:36:27.610
<v Speaker 1>What do they do or is it just an even trade?</v>

5479
02:36:27.610 --> 02:36:29.350
<v Speaker 1>Like I wouldn't pay for it.</v>

5480
02:36:29.800 --> 02:36:30.190
<v Speaker 1>They don't,</v>

5481
02:36:30.190 --> 02:36:32.020
<v Speaker 1>they don't pay you for your fat.</v>

5482
02:36:32.230 --> 02:36:34.090
<v Speaker 1>Why don't take that much either.</v>

5483
02:36:34.091 --> 02:36:34.630
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>

5484
02:36:34.630 --> 02:36:35.380
<v Speaker 1>I have a lot though.</v>

5485
02:36:35.380 --> 02:36:35.621
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5486
02:36:35.621 --> 02:36:36.760
<v Speaker 1>but they don't take enough.</v>

5487
02:36:37.210 --> 02:36:40.420
<v Speaker 1>Like you got to eat vegetables and go running up hills and stopped smoking</v>

5488
02:36:40.421 --> 02:36:40.841
<v Speaker 1>cigarettes.</v>

5489
02:36:40.841 --> 02:36:42.910
<v Speaker 1>So you get to stop what you're doing.</v>

5490
02:36:43.120 --> 02:36:44.710
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe you're back smoking cigarettes again.</v>

5491
02:36:44.740 --> 02:36:45.800
<v Speaker 1>Back to smoking a cigarette.</v>

5492
02:36:45.801 --> 02:36:46.900
<v Speaker 1>He smoked three cigarettes a day,</v>

5493
02:36:46.901 --> 02:36:47.650
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

5494
02:36:47.650 --> 02:36:49.180
<v Speaker 1>Three cigarettes compared to two packs.</v>

5495
02:36:49.181 --> 02:36:50.430
<v Speaker 1>It's still smoking cigarettes.</v>

5496
02:36:50.440 --> 02:36:51.280
<v Speaker 1>Kinda Stop Dude.</v>

5497
02:36:51.281 --> 02:36:52.110
<v Speaker 1>I swear to God.</v>

5498
02:36:52.110 --> 02:36:52.390
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

5499
02:36:52.390 --> 02:36:54.640
<v Speaker 1>I talked to that writer that was in here.</v>

5500
02:36:54.641 --> 02:36:55.860
<v Speaker 1>It says one of my biggest fears,</v>

5501
02:36:55.870 --> 02:36:57.430
<v Speaker 1>I worry about you getting sick.</v>

5502
02:36:57.790 --> 02:36:59.380
<v Speaker 1>I really do cause you're always smoking.</v>

5503
02:36:59.750 --> 02:37:01.120
<v Speaker 1>You were at least for a long time.</v>

5504
02:37:01.121 --> 02:37:01.771
<v Speaker 1>I worry about it.</v>

5505
02:37:01.771 --> 02:37:02.604
<v Speaker 1>I that's a real,</v>

5506
02:37:02.620 --> 02:37:05.020
<v Speaker 1>that's one that gets you and once it gets he like,</v>

5507
02:37:05.021 --> 02:37:05.501
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

5508
02:37:05.501 --> 02:37:06.550
<v Speaker 1>I could have avoided this.</v>

5509
02:37:07.120 --> 02:37:07.781
<v Speaker 1>That's a scary,</v>

5510
02:37:07.781 --> 02:37:10.990
<v Speaker 1>it's so scary to be close to someone and care about them like I care about you</v>

5511
02:37:11.230 --> 02:37:15.410
<v Speaker 1>and then see you smoking and know that that's eventually going to get you like,</v>

5512
02:37:15.470 --> 02:37:16.010
<v Speaker 1>do you</v>

5513
02:37:16.010 --> 02:37:16.521
<v Speaker 6>know that?</v>

5514
02:37:16.521 --> 02:37:19.520
<v Speaker 6>I think they need to make no smoking at the comedy store.</v>

5515
02:37:19.850 --> 02:37:21.440
<v Speaker 6>That's not going to ever happen.</v>

5516
02:37:21.470 --> 02:37:22.700
<v Speaker 6>That's never going to happen.</v>

5517
02:37:22.730 --> 02:37:24.650
<v Speaker 6>We just need to go to a vapor cigarettes.</v>

5518
02:37:24.680 --> 02:37:26.240
<v Speaker 6>Just go to vapor cigarettes and just,</v>

5519
02:37:26.241 --> 02:37:27.470
<v Speaker 6>and just tell yourself,</v>

5520
02:37:27.471 --> 02:37:28.790
<v Speaker 6>you can't smoke cigarettes.</v>

5521
02:37:29.270 --> 02:37:30.230
<v Speaker 6>I need to get new vapor.</v>

5522
02:37:30.380 --> 02:37:31.730

5523
02:37:31.731 --> 02:37:32.720
<v Speaker 6>How long did your free for?</v>

5524

<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

5537

5539
02:37:45.261 --> 02:37:46.310
<v Speaker 6>give yourself a couple of weeks.</v>

5540
02:37:46.311 --> 02:37:47.300
