<v Speaker 1>way and I hope other guys coming up can,</v>

59
00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.760
<v Speaker 1>can learn from you in that regard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

60
00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.090
<v Speaker 3>what are the things I thought about was </v>
<v Speaker 3>first and foremost,</v>

61
00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.610
<v Speaker 3>like I'd been rocked more than in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>last two and a half years of my practice</v>

62
00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.760
<v Speaker 3>and live fights that I had in my entire </v>
<v Speaker 3>career,</v>

63
00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.140
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

64
00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:40.153
<v Speaker 3>a lot of different factors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Probably how many times you're rolling </v>

65
00:02:42.081 --> 00:02:43.310
<v Speaker 3>the dice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

66
00:02:43.311 --> 00:02:44.870
<v Speaker 3>you get hit in the head a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 3>different times.</v>

67
00:02:44.871 --> 00:02:47.120
<v Speaker 3>Things are loosening up a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get a little bit older.</v>

68
00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.983
<v Speaker 3>Guys are getting better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got cody Garbrandt and the Jim and </v>

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

72
00:02:56.061 --> 00:02:57.860
<v Speaker 3>I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's one factor.</v>

73
00:02:57.861 --> 00:03:00.850
<v Speaker 3>And then I lost two fights in a row for </v>
<v Speaker 3>the first time in my career ever,</v>

74
00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:05.230
<v Speaker 3>even though it was a decision to dominic</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the decision to uh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I mean they'll never step foot in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>octagon,</v>

119
00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:52.143
<v Speaker 3>but they get a little bit of pride.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whether it was one day it was 10 years </v>

120
00:04:55.211 --> 00:04:56.044
<v Speaker 3>or whatever of being a part of that team</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's something they add to their </v>

121
00:04:58.541 --> 00:05:00.160
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They take on them with the next thing.</v>

122
00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:03.790
<v Speaker 3>Somebody just comes in for a week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some guys are going to be,</v>

123
00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:05.350
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>make it to the big show.</v>

124
00:05:05.351 --> 00:05:07.290
<v Speaker 3>Some guys are going to be world </v>
<v Speaker 3>champions,</v>

125
00:05:07.291 --> 00:05:09.230
<v Speaker 3>some guy's going to be hall of Famers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

126
00:05:09.231 --> 00:05:10.070
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's,</v>

127
00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.060
<v Speaker 3>that's whatever your journey is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a proud thing.</v>

128
00:05:13.061 --> 00:05:17.020
<v Speaker 3>You can put a feather in the cap and </v>
<v Speaker 3>move on to whatever you're doing next.</v>

129
00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:18.380
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>

130
00:05:18.381 --> 00:05:21.310
<v Speaker 3>it's a bigger picture and it's like </v>
<v Speaker 3>journey's never over.</v>

131
00:05:21.311 --> 00:05:22.480
<v Speaker 3>It's just always changing.</v>

132
00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.681
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for God,</v>

133
00:05:23.681 --> 00:05:25.940
<v Speaker 1>like Lance Palmer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's a real world class guy,</v>

134
00:05:25.941 --> 00:05:27.680
<v Speaker 1>but he's fighting in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do they call it now?</v>

135
00:05:27.681 --> 00:05:28.970
<v Speaker 1>It's not world series of fighting </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

136
00:05:28.971 --> 00:05:30.140
<v Speaker 1>They have a new name for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

137
00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:31.033
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They changed the name real pro fighters </v>

138
00:05:32.571 --> 00:05:34.220
<v Speaker 1>or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

139
00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.130
<v Speaker 1>but the problem is nobody's watching a </v>
<v Speaker 1>few.</v>

140
00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:40.550
<v Speaker 1>Very few people are watching,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's a real world class professional</v>

141
00:05:40.551 --> 00:05:41.384
<v Speaker 1>fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you see when just engaging came </v>

142
00:05:42.531 --> 00:05:43.790
<v Speaker 1>over to the UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you realize like,</v>

143
00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:46.400
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this fucking kid is world class and he's</v>

144
00:05:46.401 --> 00:05:48.830
<v Speaker 1>been fighting in an organization that no</v>
<v Speaker 1>one's watching.</v>

145
00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:49.781
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

146
00:05:49.781 --> 00:05:50.614
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the hard part about that is like you </v>

147
00:05:52.571 --> 00:05:53.404
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got a gate and you got to Lance </v>

148
00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:55.983
<v Speaker 3>Palmer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're still fighting tough ass dudes </v>

149
00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:58.070
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

150
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:00.440
<v Speaker 2>it's the same level of competition </v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes,</v>

151
00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:01.633
<v Speaker 2>sometimes even even worse when they get </v>
<v Speaker 2>all the Russians over in belt or like </v>

152
00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:07.420
<v Speaker 2>those Russians are tough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

153
00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:08.273
<v Speaker 2>so like freelance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we just have to exit them at the right </v>

154
00:06:11.151 --> 00:06:11.984
<v Speaker 2>opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He asked to get on a little winning </v>

155
00:06:13.611 --> 00:06:16.310
<v Speaker 2>streak and be at the right time in his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in his,</v>

156
00:06:16.311 --> 00:06:19.040
<v Speaker 2>in his contract and be able to jump out </v>
<v Speaker 2>and go to the big show.</v>

157
00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:20.143
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard because he's fighting these </v>

158
00:06:21.591 --> 00:06:22.670
<v Speaker 2>tough guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the last guy,</v>

159
00:06:22.671 --> 00:06:23.504
<v Speaker 2>he lost it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he broke his hand the first round and </v>

160
00:06:25.191 --> 00:06:27.380
<v Speaker 2>then he's fighting a tough guy and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

161
00:06:27.381 --> 00:06:28.700
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he lost in this show.</v>

162
00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:32.090
<v Speaker 2>He lost against a world class dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's a world class fighter.</v>

163
00:06:32.091 --> 00:06:32.990
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

164
00:06:32.991 --> 00:06:33.610
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

165
00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:35.900
<v Speaker 2>it's hopefully just something where he </v>
<v Speaker 2>can make that transition over.</v>

166
00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:36.540
<v Speaker 2>How do you guys</v>

167
00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:40.970
<v Speaker 4>feel about a win lose?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like pay days?</v>

168
00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:45.140
<v Speaker 4>Like one thing that bothers me about mma</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that mma,</v>

169
00:06:45.141 --> 00:06:45.974
<v Speaker 4>if you win,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you get a certain amount and if you </v>

170
00:06:47.511 --> 00:06:48.980
<v Speaker 4>lose,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you get less.</v>

171
00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:50.353
<v Speaker 4>I feel like contractual.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I feel like you should have a </v>

172
00:06:52.821 --> 00:06:57.821
<v Speaker 4>contractual amount that you get paid and</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like when you're leaving it up to</v>

173
00:06:57.890 --> 00:06:58.723
<v Speaker 4>the judges sometimes and the judges,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean both of you guys have been </v>

174
00:07:01.491 --> 00:07:02.324
<v Speaker 4>involved in least teammates getting </v>
<v Speaker 4>terrible calls tall and you've seen it </v>

175
00:07:06.621 --> 00:07:08.000
<v Speaker 4>and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what in the fuck?</v>

176
00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:09.020
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like look,</v>

177
00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:09.853
<v Speaker 4>even in boxing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the conor Mcgregor Floyd Mayweather </v>

178
00:07:11.481 --> 00:07:12.314
<v Speaker 4>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Two of those judges had connor only </v>

179
00:07:13.731 --> 00:07:14.570
<v Speaker 4>winning one round.</v>

180
00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:15.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How?</v>

181
00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:17.440
<v Speaker 2>They're crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're crazy.</v>

182
00:07:17.441 --> 00:07:20.140
<v Speaker 2>I was looking around at those judges to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're very familiar.</v>

183
00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:23.500
<v Speaker 2>Some of them were a mma.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Make a judges also,</v>

184
00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:24.010
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

185
00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:24.843
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of them that did that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They started with boxing and then they </v>

186
00:07:26.561 --> 00:07:30.130
<v Speaker 4>learned a little bit about Emma man and </v>
<v Speaker 4>he came over and sort of judging mma,</v>

187
00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:31.173
<v Speaker 4>but there's a lot of them that literally</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't know what they're judging or know </v>

188
00:07:33.731 --> 00:07:36.660
<v Speaker 4>very little about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And your career could be.</v>

189
00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:38.640
<v Speaker 4>You mean you could,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you might have 100 and 100,</v>

190
00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:39.483
<v Speaker 4>so $100,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>swing on someone who doesn't know Jack </v>

191
00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:43.260
<v Speaker 4>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

192
00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:44.280
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's terrible.</v>

193
00:07:44.281 --> 00:07:45.990
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

194
00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:48.390
<v Speaker 2>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess for me as a fighter,</v>

195
00:07:48.391 --> 00:07:51.120
<v Speaker 2>I look at it like it's rewarding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

196
00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:52.283
<v Speaker 2>but then the opposite scale of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can be on that losing call and </v>

197
00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:56.900
<v Speaker 2>horrible call the rep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>screw Ya,</v>

198
00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:58.260
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for me it's.</v>

199
00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:01.830
<v Speaker 2>And they still appear like it's pure </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing to do,</v>

200
00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:04.950
<v Speaker 2>so you got to go in there and fight for </v>
<v Speaker 2>two checks is more your training.</v>

201
00:08:04.951 --> 00:08:07.620
<v Speaker 2>You come out with two checks you lose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's for me,</v>

202
00:08:07.621 --> 00:08:08.454
<v Speaker 2>I honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I always remember getting a check </v>

203
00:08:11.101 --> 00:08:12.900
<v Speaker 2>afterwards and especially when I first </v>
<v Speaker 2>started,</v>

204
00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:13.950
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>

205
00:08:13.951 --> 00:08:15.690
<v Speaker 2>I got paid for this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like literally,</v>

206
00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:18.390
<v Speaker 2>like it had nothing to do with the money</v>
<v Speaker 2>at all.</v>

207
00:08:18.570 --> 00:08:20.550
<v Speaker 2>And then you got that check and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

208
00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:21.413
<v Speaker 2>oh man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you're doing it for the right </v>

209
00:08:24.391 --> 00:08:27.090
<v Speaker 2>reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it should be.</v>

210
00:08:27.091 --> 00:08:28.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just get your set amount.</v>

211
00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:30.053
<v Speaker 2>I think that is to warrant against the </v>
<v Speaker 2>guys that are doing it for the wrong </v>

212
00:08:32.551 --> 00:08:33.384
<v Speaker 2>reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was a good motivation at </v>

213
00:08:34.921 --> 00:08:36.990
<v Speaker 2>first or when they're trying to build </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

214
00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:39.100
<v Speaker 4>but now it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're not building it anymore.</v>

215
00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:43.650
<v Speaker 4>Now it's a world class professional </v>
<v Speaker 4>sport and I remember Uriah when you were</v>

216
00:08:43.651 --> 00:08:45.060
<v Speaker 4>fighting in the cage,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

217
00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:49.380
<v Speaker 2>I remember the first time I saw you </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>

218
00:08:49.381 --> 00:08:51.640
<v Speaker 2>I think you're fighting 55 to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

219
00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:52.773
<v Speaker 2>I had to start.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there was no weight class for me </v>

220
00:08:54.101 --> 00:08:55.140
<v Speaker 2>at that time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

221
00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:56.183
<v Speaker 2>Now I remember talking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember I was all pumped because </v>

222
00:08:57.631 --> 00:09:00.420
<v Speaker 2>Rogan knew who I was because he followed</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the underground shit.</v>

223
00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:02.423
<v Speaker 2>I was super self aware of like how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much my notoriety was and like the </v>

224
00:09:05.971 --> 00:09:07.340
<v Speaker 2>bigger show because I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

225
00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:09.000

<v Speaker 2>I started looking on there and be like,</v>

226
00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:12.090
<v Speaker 2>I only have like 1500 people watching my</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

<v Speaker 2>like $250,000.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck no.</v>

229
00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:18.750

<v Speaker 2>Well I was frightened.</v>

230
00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:19.703
<v Speaker 2>I mean I fought Tyson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My first loss was against Tyson Griffin </v>

231
00:09:23.641 --> 00:09:26.700
<v Speaker 2>and cannot die casino and in the parking</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot.</v>

233
00:09:34.351 --> 00:09:35.184
<v Speaker 2>steel pole and just gashed my head open </v>
<v Speaker 2>like eight seconds into the fight and </v>

234
00:09:39.361 --> 00:09:42.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm just pouring down blood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember that they didn't have padding</v>

235
00:09:42.241 --> 00:09:43.920
<v Speaker 2>on the pole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well they supposed to do it,</v>

236
00:09:43.921 --> 00:09:46.380
<v Speaker 2>but that the crew was running out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>

237
00:09:46.381 --> 00:09:49.080
<v Speaker 2>so they didn't even take the time to put</v>
<v Speaker 2>the padding on the bottom level.</v>

238
00:09:49.081 --> 00:09:53.280
<v Speaker 2>They just put the clear like fake </v>
<v Speaker 2>leather on the top of it.</v>

00:18:46.271 --> 00:18:46.841
<v Speaker 3>bro.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

465
00:18:46.841 --> 00:18:48.580
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've always,</v>

466
00:18:49.180 --> 00:18:51.070
<v Speaker 3>I've done this kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't really like to run.</v>

467
00:18:51.071 --> 00:18:54.310
<v Speaker 3>It's not part of my regimen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guarantee I'm gonna be in great shape.</v>

468
00:18:54.580 --> 00:18:57.250
<v Speaker 3>And he went in there and he fought </v>
<v Speaker 3>dominick cruz and I mean,</v>

469
00:18:57.490 --> 00:18:58.323
<v Speaker 3>so you can't really argue with that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in my opinion I think it's a great </v>

470
00:19:02.411 --> 00:19:03.760
<v Speaker 3>way to get yourself uncomfortable.</v>

471
00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:08.170
<v Speaker 3>You can run easier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can run hard to simulate the feeling</v>

472
00:19:08.171 --> 00:19:09.910
<v Speaker 3>where your lungs are going to blow up </v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

473
00:19:09.911 --> 00:19:12.160
<v Speaker 3>your head's going to pop in your fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>teeth hurt.</v>

474
00:19:12.670 --> 00:19:15.130
<v Speaker 3>like I like to be able to do that with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with running.</v>

475
00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:17.823
<v Speaker 3>But you can get the same thing at a hard</v>
<v Speaker 3>goal in wrestling or jujitsu go if </v>

476
00:19:20.471 --> 00:19:21.304
<v Speaker 3>you're pushing the pace or a boxing go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you can simulate that type of like </v>

477
00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:25.893
<v Speaker 3>energy and expenditure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you're forced to do it when you're </v>

478
00:19:28.181 --> 00:19:29.980
<v Speaker 3>running really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really fast until you.</v>

479
00:19:30.010 --> 00:19:31.690
<v Speaker 3>Until you stop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no coasting,</v>

480
00:19:31.691 --> 00:19:32.524
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

481
00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:34.450
<v Speaker 3>But it's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I asked dan henderson,</v>

482
00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:37.840
<v Speaker 3>I asked dan harrison his good buddy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

483
00:19:38.650 --> 00:19:39.483
<v Speaker 3>when I first started fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know I was trained with randy </v>

484
00:19:41.411 --> 00:19:43.750
<v Speaker 3>couture and dan henderson.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They would come out to sacramento and do</v>

485
00:19:43.751 --> 00:19:48.070
<v Speaker 3>little camps and stuff and I ask a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I asked dan or dan henderson's buddy.</v>

486
00:19:48.071 --> 00:19:48.730
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bro,</v>

<v Speaker 3>dan hasn't ran and 12 years.</v>

<v Speaker 3>And that motherfuckers is savage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>

490
00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:04.240
<v Speaker 3>he's a savage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He is a savage.</v>

491
00:20:04.241 --> 00:20:05.430
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mike.</v>

492
00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:07.930
<v Speaker 3>He's a mentally toughest dude ever.</v>

493
00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:10.420
<v Speaker 5>My uncle was all like old school </v>
<v Speaker 5>trainer,</v>

494
00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:12.430
<v Speaker 5>so we'd like pad work,</v>
<v Speaker 5>bag,</v>

495
00:20:12.431 --> 00:20:14.340
<v Speaker 5>work,</v>
<v Speaker 5>run shadow box,</v>

496
00:20:14.370 --> 00:20:15.170
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

497
00:20:15.170 --> 00:20:16.030
<v Speaker 5>and spar.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We get.</v>

498
00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:18.880
<v Speaker 5>When I was younger he would get us 50 </v>
<v Speaker 5>rounds of work.</v>

499
00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:20.710
<v Speaker 5>It's like you get 50 rounds,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're ready for a fight.</v>

500
00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:23.410
<v Speaker 5>We'd always spar 50 rounds of boxing </v>
<v Speaker 5>rounds when you're younger.</v>

501
00:20:23.590 --> 00:20:27.160
<v Speaker 5>50 rounds and rounds fight before the </v>
<v Speaker 5>fight.</v>

502
00:20:27.161 --> 00:20:29.740
<v Speaker 5>So it could be five rounds,</v>
<v Speaker 5>10 times.</v>

503
00:20:29.741 --> 00:20:30.574
<v Speaker 5>Is that what you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

504
00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:33.070
<v Speaker 5>throughout the four or five weekends to </v>
<v Speaker 5>your fight,</v>

505
00:20:33.071 --> 00:20:33.930
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fight every.</v>

506
00:20:33.970 --> 00:20:35.770
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes we live in the tri tristate </v>
<v Speaker 5>area.</v>

507
00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:39.790
<v Speaker 5>So I would fight and I had a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 5>books I'd fight in Ohio on friday,</v>

508
00:20:40.090 --> 00:20:42.790
<v Speaker 5>saturday and Pennsylvania,</v>
<v Speaker 5>West Virginia on sunday.</v>

509
00:20:42.791 --> 00:20:44.650
<v Speaker 5>So I had three fights and we can't do </v>
<v Speaker 5>that anymore,</v>

510
00:20:44.651 --> 00:20:47.800
<v Speaker 5>but we lived in the tristate so we </v>
<v Speaker 5>always had these regional books,</v>

511
00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:49.060
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and if I,</v>

512
00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:51.190
<v Speaker 5>I got this book,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you only have five fights,</v>

513
00:20:51.191 --> 00:20:52.050
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this guy's,</v>

514
00:20:52.170 --> 00:20:54.970
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>has 100 so box amateur boxing was almost</v>

515
00:20:54.971 --> 00:20:56.170
<v Speaker 5>like am dressing.</v>

516
00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:57.250
<v Speaker 5>they're always,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

517
00:20:57.460 --> 00:21:00.280
<v Speaker 5>competing like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But he never really forced us to run.</v>

518
00:21:00.370 --> 00:21:01.480
<v Speaker 5>We always spark,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

519
00:21:01.481 --> 00:21:03.070
<v Speaker 5>that's when you really fight would </v>
<v Speaker 5>happen.</v>

520
00:21:03.071 --> 00:21:05.710
<v Speaker 5>So I'm just composing that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He always told me growing up,</v>

521
00:21:05.711 --> 00:21:06.544
<v Speaker 5>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fighting doesn't make you a better </v>

522
00:21:06.941 --> 00:21:09.400
<v Speaker 5>runner or running doesn't make you a </v>
<v Speaker 5>better fighter,</v>

523
00:21:09.610 --> 00:21:12.070
<v Speaker 5>so I just always tell it to favorite.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Every time he wants you to do those damn</v>

524
00:21:12.071 --> 00:21:15.520
<v Speaker 5>runs he's running doesn't make you a </v>
<v Speaker 5>better fighter.</v>

525
00:21:15.930 --> 00:21:16.763
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a bunch of different schools of </v>

526
00:21:17.261 --> 00:21:21.100
<v Speaker 5>thought on it and some people think that</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have to run like long distance.</v>

527
00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:22.253
<v Speaker 5>Just enable your body to dig deep in </v>
<v Speaker 5>those late rounds when you're getting </v>

528
00:21:26.321 --> 00:21:27.970
<v Speaker 5>tired that you'll have more endurance.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That way</v>

529
00:21:28.270 --> 00:21:30.130
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's true,</v>

530
00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:34.510
<v Speaker 3>but the whole thought process behind one</v>
<v Speaker 3>person's theory.</v>

531
00:21:34.511 --> 00:21:35.344
<v Speaker 3>This is why I can't stand coaches that I</v>
<v Speaker 3>think it's the only way you know what </v>

532
00:21:39.151 --> 00:21:39.984
<v Speaker 3>always learn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course you always want input from </v>

533
00:21:41.021 --> 00:21:42.640
<v Speaker 3>other people and you have things at </v>
<v Speaker 3>work,</v>

534
00:21:42.641 --> 00:21:44.480
<v Speaker 3>but like even my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>

535
00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:45.343
<v Speaker 3>my manager back in the day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he always used to worry about Chad </v>

536
00:21:47.471 --> 00:21:50.920
<v Speaker 3>mendez,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his training because like Chad mendez,</v>

537
00:21:50.921 --> 00:21:51.754
<v Speaker 3>lance palmer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those are two guys that had been </v>

538
00:21:53.081 --> 00:21:56.470
<v Speaker 3>training since they were five years old </v>
<v Speaker 3>on a regimen,</v>

539
00:21:56.830 --> 00:21:57.663
<v Speaker 3>like their dads pushing them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>making them go to this and making them </v>

540
00:21:59.591 --> 00:22:00.424
<v Speaker 3>do that and so they're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're like little vacations they got </v>

541
00:22:03.730 --> 00:22:06.910
<v Speaker 3>were like the most they needed that they</v>
<v Speaker 3>needed to go,</v>

542
00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.980
<v Speaker 3>go hunting or go fishing and get the </v>
<v Speaker 3>break.</v>

543
00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:10.300
<v Speaker 3>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was always.</v>

544
00:22:10.301 --> 00:22:11.134
<v Speaker 3>My dad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'd.</v>

545
00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:13.420
<v Speaker 3>He dropped the trailer off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'd have a,</v>

546
00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:14.860
<v Speaker 3>a motor home.</v>

547
00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:17.140
<v Speaker 3>He dropped it off at a pawn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He'd go to work and we'd fish all day.</v>

548
00:22:17.150 --> 00:22:18.730
<v Speaker 3>Knew no one was having me wrestle or do </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything.</v>

549
00:22:18.731 --> 00:22:21.400
<v Speaker 3>I didn't start till I was in the eighth </v>
<v Speaker 3>grade,</v>

550
00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:26.170
<v Speaker 3>so I've always been on like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like trying to catch up kind of deal and</v>

551
00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:28.690
<v Speaker 3>like a chat and lance are like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get your homework done.</v>

552
00:22:28.691 --> 00:22:29.524
<v Speaker 3>You train your butt off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you do a regimen and then you take your </v>

553
00:22:30.851 --> 00:22:32.890
<v Speaker 3>little break and then you'd take your </v>
<v Speaker 3>breaks,</v>

554
00:22:32.891 --> 00:22:34.720
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it doesn't matter.</v>

555
00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:35.943
<v Speaker 3>It's just about what you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you're processing as your method </v>

556
00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:40.480
<v Speaker 3>that you believe in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As long as you really believe in it.</v>

557
00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:41.853
<v Speaker 3>That's the most important thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The belief system is bigger than </v>

558
00:22:43.961 --> 00:22:44.530
<v Speaker 3>anything else.</v>

559
00:22:44.530 --> 00:22:45.363
<v Speaker 5>It's gotta be,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's gotta be different methods for </v>

560
00:22:46.961 --> 00:22:50.560
<v Speaker 5>different fighting styles too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean some people move around more like</v>

561
00:22:50.561 --> 00:22:54.400
<v Speaker 5>dominic and some people are more,</v>
<v Speaker 5>more stationary and you know,</v>

562
00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:55.253
<v Speaker 5>rely more on power.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean there's got gotta be different </v>

563
00:22:57.940 --> 00:22:58.773
<v Speaker 5>routines that would be more effect and </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's kind of about finding whatever </v>

564
00:23:01.421 --> 00:23:02.440
<v Speaker 5>works best for you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

565
00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:03.910
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>For me,</v>

566
00:23:03.911 --> 00:23:06.550
<v Speaker 5>I like sprints on like a very explosive </v>
<v Speaker 5>fighter,</v>

567
00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:08.020
<v Speaker 5>but also I have endurance.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She was like,</v>

568
00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:09.213
<v Speaker 5>I did the vo two testing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's actually I tested as a cross </v>

569
00:23:11.141 --> 00:23:14.170
<v Speaker 5>country runner.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I hate running on the results,</v>

570
00:23:14.171 --> 00:23:14.950
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so,</v>

571
00:23:14.950 --> 00:23:15.850
<v Speaker 5>but I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well I feel like I'm,</v>

572
00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:17.740
<v Speaker 5>I do better at spreading then long </v>
<v Speaker 5>distance,</v>

573
00:23:17.741 --> 00:23:20.050
<v Speaker 5>but it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like what,</v>

574
00:23:20.051 --> 00:23:23.390
<v Speaker 5>you have to be in shape for going,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

575
00:23:23.391 --> 00:23:24.224
<v Speaker 5>to fight for the cage.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you have to be a great wrestling </v>

576
00:23:26.441 --> 00:23:27.810
<v Speaker 5>conditioning,</v>
<v Speaker 5>boxing conditions.</v>

577
00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:31.450
<v Speaker 5>Those are all different conditioning.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like a boxer comes in and wrestles.</v>

578
00:23:31.630 --> 00:23:35.800
<v Speaker 5>he's toasting a minute if that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>sometimes wrestlers they same thing.</v>

579
00:23:35.801 --> 00:23:38.350
<v Speaker 5>They go in there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>their box color just to composure,</v>

580
00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:39.660
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's what made with herbs.</v>

581
00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:41.530
<v Speaker 5>I would.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Connor said right after mayweather.</v>

582
00:23:41.531 --> 00:23:43.120
<v Speaker 5>He said shots were nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He didn't,</v>

583
00:23:43.121 --> 00:23:45.040
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was just the composure.</v>

584
00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:46.130
<v Speaker 5>Allen's logged</v>

585
00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:48.070
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just so efficient to any new.</v>

586
00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:48.933
<v Speaker 1>The connor was going to fade because </v>
<v Speaker 1>connor was relying so much on </v>

587
00:23:50.781 --> 00:23:52.770
<v Speaker 1>explosiveness and tense and so</v>

588
00:23:53.050 --> 00:23:54.590
<v Speaker 3>and they didn't have enough time to </v>
<v Speaker 3>prepare.</v>

589
00:23:56.330 --> 00:23:57.163
<v Speaker 3>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought connor did a good job of </v>

590
00:23:58.221 --> 00:24:01.220
<v Speaker 3>staying nice and flow and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But here's,</v>

591
00:24:01.250 --> 00:24:02.083
<v Speaker 3>here's the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like if I were to take a pretty </v>

592
00:24:05.211 --> 00:24:06.044
<v Speaker 3>good high school wrestler or like a even</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a really good high school wrestler </v>

593
00:24:09.410 --> 00:24:13.340
<v Speaker 3>and put them against an olympic gold </v>
<v Speaker 3>medalist,</v>

594
00:24:13.341 --> 00:24:14.174
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a high high level high school </v>

595
00:24:15.501 --> 00:24:18.140
<v Speaker 3>wrestler versus an olympic gold </v>
<v Speaker 3>medalist.</v>

596
00:24:18.770 --> 00:24:20.480
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's going to be a difference,</v>

597
00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:23.540
<v Speaker 3>but when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when the fatigue cracks a little bit,</v>

598
00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:25.423
<v Speaker 3>it starts happening a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>one guy's gonna keep composure </v>

599
00:24:27.711 --> 00:24:28.544
<v Speaker 3>completely and the other guy going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>have a little bit of a of an opening in </v>

600
00:24:31.641 --> 00:24:32.474
<v Speaker 3>the other guy will be able to to to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to isolate that and I think that's what </v>

601
00:24:35.421 --> 00:24:38.690
<v Speaker 3>happened with the fight and I figured </v>
<v Speaker 3>that would happen.</v>

602
00:24:38.691 --> 00:24:40.850
<v Speaker 3>I just didn't think that connor would do</v>
<v Speaker 3>that well,</v>

603
00:24:40.851 --> 00:24:42.620
<v Speaker 3>the whole fight until it happened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

604
00:24:42.770 --> 00:24:43.730
<v Speaker 3>he was doing awesome.</v>

605
00:24:43.850 --> 00:24:44.683
<v Speaker 1>It makes me wonder like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how would he have done if he had six </v>

606
00:24:46.941 --> 00:24:49.780
<v Speaker 1>months to prepare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how good would he have done if he got in</v>

607
00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:51.273
<v Speaker 1>good shape?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it might've been able to make it </v>

608
00:24:52.521 --> 00:24:53.354
<v Speaker 1>to the twelfth round.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think either way the more loose floyd </v>

609
00:24:56.871 --> 00:24:57.704
<v Speaker 1>got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more he was going to start landing </v>

610
00:24:58.491 --> 00:25:00.530
<v Speaker 1>shots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just a far better boxer.</v>

611
00:25:00.890 --> 00:25:01.723
<v Speaker 1>He's especially.</v>

612
00:25:01.990 --> 00:25:04.450
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it would be.</v>

613
00:25:04.451 --> 00:25:05.284
<v Speaker 3>It's about getting in shape necessarily </v>
<v Speaker 3>because connor had to be in amazing </v>

614
00:25:08.471 --> 00:25:10.210
<v Speaker 3>shape.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's already a world champion.</v>

615
00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:14.380
<v Speaker 3>Then he's got this big opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I always tell the guys also,</v>

616
00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:16.270
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't matter what kind of shape </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're in.</v>

617
00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:21.040
<v Speaker 3>Being a cheap only means you can do more</v>
<v Speaker 3>until you get tired.</v>

618
00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:23.980
<v Speaker 3>I think the better shape you're in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He would've kept doing more,</v>

619
00:25:23.981 --> 00:25:24.970
<v Speaker 3>do more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do more,</v>

620
00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:27.450
<v Speaker 3>and if he wasn't able to finish him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

621
00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:31.290
<v Speaker 3>Because floyd was lettIng him do more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it wasn't letting him,</v>

622
00:25:31.291 --> 00:25:34.930
<v Speaker 3>he was wasn't letting him necessarily,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was taken rounds on for sure.</v>

623
00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:38.340
<v Speaker 3>Letting connor blow out to manager.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>

624
00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:39.303
<v Speaker 3>it's like the better shape you're in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the more you're going to output until </v>

625
00:25:41.261 --> 00:25:43.420
<v Speaker 3>you get tired,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you're trying to fucking win,</v>

626
00:25:43.421 --> 00:25:44.500
<v Speaker 3>you're going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

627
00:25:45.770 --> 00:25:47.350
<v Speaker 3>you're going to be putting it out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>putting it out,</v>

628
00:25:47.351 --> 00:25:48.184
<v Speaker 3>putting out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he would have been able to do </v>

629
00:25:49.031 --> 00:25:51.610
<v Speaker 3>more until he got tired.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the fatigue would set in.</v>

630
00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:52.590
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there was.</v>

631
00:25:52.590 --> 00:25:56.120
<v Speaker 5>We had this in our wrestling room,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a board saying,</v>

632
00:25:56.130 --> 00:25:58.300
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fatigue makes cowards of us all know.</v>

633
00:25:58.320 --> 00:25:59.280
<v Speaker 5>I read that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

634
00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:00.413
<v Speaker 5>I had this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was in the same restroom since I was </v>

635
00:26:01.171 --> 00:26:02.490
<v Speaker 5>five years old.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All the way until,</v>

636
00:26:02.590 --> 00:26:03.680
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sophomore year,</v>

637
00:26:03.870 --> 00:26:07.050
<v Speaker 5>junior year I was done wrestling,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I always read that I was like,</v>

638
00:26:07.051 --> 00:26:07.950
<v Speaker 5>man fatigue,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

639
00:26:07.951 --> 00:26:09.720
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't even know if it was,</v>

640
00:26:09.721 --> 00:26:10.554
<v Speaker 5>but I knew what a coward was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it was like I knew they didn't go </v>

641
00:26:12.001 --> 00:26:14.250
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I would literally go so hard.</v>

642
00:26:14.251 --> 00:26:16.200
<v Speaker 5>I know how to wrestle really.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would just would go,</v>

643
00:26:16.201 --> 00:26:16.621
<v Speaker 5>go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>go,</v>

644
00:26:16.621 --> 00:26:18.420
<v Speaker 5>go and just keep scrambling out of </v>
<v Speaker 5>things.</v>

645
00:26:18.421 --> 00:26:19.254
<v Speaker 5>And that's how I always dress well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And my brother was like the same exact </v>

646
00:26:22.651 --> 00:26:23.410
<v Speaker 5>way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was a grinder,</v>

647
00:26:23.410 --> 00:26:26.040
<v Speaker 5>old school wrestler and I had him </v>
<v Speaker 5>pushing me.</v>

648
00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:29.080
<v Speaker 5>So it was always that fatigue,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fatigue makes cowards of us all.</v>

649
00:26:29.090 --> 00:26:30.990
<v Speaker 5>So when you get tired you're always </v>
<v Speaker 5>going to get tired in the fight.</v>

650
00:26:31.290 --> 00:26:33.570
<v Speaker 5>Like I didn't know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've never been to the fourth round.</v>

651
00:26:33.630 --> 00:26:34.750
<v Speaker 5>Been in the third one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you know,</v>

652
00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:37.170
<v Speaker 5>with,</v>
<v Speaker 5>with cruz had all these questions like,</v>

653
00:26:37.171 --> 00:26:38.004
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how is it going to be as composures can </v>

654
00:26:39.591 --> 00:26:40.290
<v Speaker 5>they go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

655
00:26:40.290 --> 00:26:42.660
<v Speaker 5>keep that power and speed up the fifth </v>
<v Speaker 5>round.</v>

656
00:26:42.930 --> 00:26:43.763
<v Speaker 5>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't know how I prepared for that </v>

657
00:26:45.571 --> 00:26:48.240
<v Speaker 5>and believe that's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it just believing I was tired,</v>

658
00:26:48.270 --> 00:26:49.103
<v Speaker 5>but I was having so much fun in there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You juSt kind of pushed through that </v>

659
00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:51.473
<v Speaker 5>when you're tIred.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's the thing when fatigue sets </v>

660
00:26:52.891 --> 00:26:53.724
<v Speaker 5>in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some people can either wilt from it or </v>

661
00:26:56.010 --> 00:26:57.200
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>propel them to like,</v>

662
00:26:57.480 --> 00:27:00.880
<v Speaker 5>when I get tired I feel like I biked </v>
<v Speaker 5>down while I'm more iSo index.</v>

663
00:27:00.940 --> 00:27:01.773
<v Speaker 5>I'm tired.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know that mistakes happen when you're </v>

664
00:27:03.331 --> 00:27:03.931
<v Speaker 5>tired.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So he has,</v>

665
00:27:03.931 --> 00:27:04.764
<v Speaker 5>when he's got to stay on it more to </v>
<v Speaker 5>concentrate more on keeping your </v>

666
00:27:08.191 --> 00:27:10.590
<v Speaker 5>technique clean and making sure that </v>
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

667
00:27:10.591 --> 00:27:11.341
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

668
00:27:11.341 --> 00:27:12.174
<v Speaker 5>it's an interesting thing when you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>fighting a guy like dominic crew too </v>

669
00:27:14.461 --> 00:27:16.980
<v Speaker 5>because he's so awkward.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

670
00:27:16.981 --> 00:27:17.511
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>

671
00:27:17.511 --> 00:27:19.870
<v Speaker 5>you're preparing for someone who moves </v>
<v Speaker 5>in such a way.</v>

672
00:27:19.890 --> 00:27:20.701
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're right.</v>

673
00:27:20.701 --> 00:27:23.310
<v Speaker 5>you knew better than anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You fought them several times.</v>

674
00:27:23.311 --> 00:27:25.470
<v Speaker 5>So he was so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

675
00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:29.330
<v Speaker 3>he does move weird,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the second time I fought him,</v>

676
00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:31.980
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like it did a good job of,</v>

677
00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:34.400
<v Speaker 3>of like letting him move and then when </v>
<v Speaker 3>he'd landed,</v>

678
00:27:34.401 --> 00:27:35.234
<v Speaker 3>hit him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the one thing I went back and I </v>

679
00:27:37.791 --> 00:27:39.290
<v Speaker 3>watched that fight and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

680
00:27:39.291 --> 00:27:41.840
<v Speaker 3>you're always looking at excuses of why,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

681
00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:46.860
<v Speaker 3>why did I lose this fight or not?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think little things count,</v>

682
00:27:46.870 --> 00:27:50.600
<v Speaker 3>and I talked to cody about this in his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in his fight with,</v>

683
00:27:50.601 --> 00:27:51.434
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with don was let's make sure the eyes </v>

684
00:27:52.941 --> 00:27:53.774
<v Speaker 3>are on you when there's no action </v>
<v Speaker 3>happening because dominic has always </v>

685
00:27:56.751 --> 00:27:58.340
<v Speaker 3>doing this weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like peacocking,</v>

686
00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:01.640
<v Speaker 3>he's moving and doing these little </v>
<v Speaker 3>movements and weird shit.</v>

687
00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:04.220
<v Speaker 3>And so when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when nothing's happening,</v>

688
00:28:04.970 --> 00:28:06.770
<v Speaker 3>who you're looking at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're looking at the weirdo,</v>

689
00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:10.550
<v Speaker 3>you know what I'm saying this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said yeah.</v>

690
00:28:11.150 --> 00:28:14.240
<v Speaker 3>So then it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he is weird,</v>

691
00:28:14.241 --> 00:28:16.330
<v Speaker 3>but it's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

692
00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:18.170
<v Speaker 3>it's a different kind of weird.</v>

00:32:22.211 --> 00:32:23.080
<v Speaker 5>tricks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was just,</v>

810
00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:25.420
<v Speaker 5>it was hard.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was honestly hard.</v>

811
00:32:25.570 --> 00:32:29.200
<v Speaker 5>It's got to be weird coaching people in </v>
<v Speaker 5>a short period oF time like that to me.</v>

812
00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:32.230
<v Speaker 5>You really need veterans.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

813
00:32:32.231 --> 00:32:33.160
<v Speaker 5>So it was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was.</v>

814
00:32:35.590 --> 00:32:37.450
<v Speaker 5>We had no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't do any of my research on them,</v>

815
00:32:37.451 --> 00:32:40.010
<v Speaker 5>like how they did outside of the ufc </v>
<v Speaker 5>career,</v>

816
00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:41.860
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember I'm in the ufc,</v>

817
00:32:41.861 --> 00:32:42.381
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

818
00:32:42.381 --> 00:32:43.220
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this guys,</v>

819
00:32:43.490 --> 00:32:45.770
<v Speaker 4>he can fight eddie gordon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So these massive,</v>

820
00:32:45.771 --> 00:32:46.940
<v Speaker 4>let's go with him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

821
00:32:47.490 --> 00:32:50.420
<v Speaker 4>how we just didn't know like how they </v>
<v Speaker 4>did outside of it,</v>

822
00:32:50.421 --> 00:32:51.254
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I would have just assumed that like </v>

823
00:32:52.450 --> 00:32:53.283
<v Speaker 4>as a coach,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you get anybody and you're working </v>

824
00:32:55.281 --> 00:32:57.650
<v Speaker 4>with for six weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you would start thinking,</v>

825
00:32:57.680 --> 00:33:00.680
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I had six months exactly rid of this.</v>

826
00:33:00.770 --> 00:33:01.603
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I noticed when I coached against </v>

827
00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:03.920
<v Speaker 2>don,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had a,</v>

828

833
00:33:16.900 --> 00:33:19.230

<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had the whole crew out there.</v>

<v Speaker 2>young guys coming up to try and get them</v>

<v Speaker 2>It was</v>

839
00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:36.220
<v Speaker 4>various three connor season.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was when I came out.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I was ready to leave vegas.</v>

841
00:33:38.870 --> 00:33:41.440
<v Speaker 4>Like I couldn't wait to leave vegas </v>
<v Speaker 4>after that.</v>

842
00:33:41.441 --> 00:33:42.274
<v Speaker 4>It was just.</v>

843
00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:44.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>same as cody is what my coaches remember</v>

844
00:33:44.670 --> 00:33:46.380
<v Speaker 2>for the bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

845
00:33:46.381 --> 00:33:46.680
<v Speaker 2>it seems</v>

846
00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:47.513
<v Speaker 4>send me that like vegas to live in vegas</v>
<v Speaker 4>is kind of like living near a nuclear </v>

847
00:33:51.301 --> 00:33:52.134
<v Speaker 4>reactor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you may be able to do it for a </v>

848
00:33:54.030 --> 00:33:54.863
<v Speaker 4>couple days,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but after awhile the radiation is going </v>

849
00:33:56.661 --> 00:34:01.661
<v Speaker 4>to get you one wrong decision from a </v>
<v Speaker 4>whole change of life.</v>

850
00:34:04.050 --> 00:34:04.883
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of a sudden you won't have seen </v>

851
00:34:06.620 --> 00:34:08.000
<v Speaker 2>daytime for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a couple.</v>

852
00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:11.310
<v Speaker 4>This also in my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my feelings on it is that your round,</v>

853
00:34:11.311 --> 00:34:12.144
<v Speaker 4>like maybe it's just me being sensitive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think you're around people that </v>

854
00:34:14.821 --> 00:34:15.654
<v Speaker 4>make shitty decisions allowed to around </v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of that in vegas because you're </v>

855
00:34:18.481 --> 00:34:22.230
<v Speaker 4>around a lot of compulsive gamblers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just a vibe of the city,</v>

856
00:34:22.350 --> 00:34:25.380
<v Speaker 4>like there's great shit in the city,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of successful people,</v>

857
00:34:25.381 --> 00:34:27.810
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dana and the fertittas and there's a lot</v>

858
00:34:27.811 --> 00:34:30.660
<v Speaker 4>of people that are making great money </v>
<v Speaker 4>and doing well in business,</v>

859
00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:35.900
<v Speaker 4>but then there's a whole like underbelly</v>
<v Speaker 4>to the city that's compulsive gamblers,</v>

860
00:34:36.630 --> 00:34:39.160
<v Speaker 4>have a ship and a bunch of other stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>compulsive,</v>

861
00:34:39.180 --> 00:34:40.190
<v Speaker 4>all sorts of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

863
00:34:43.310 --> 00:34:45.980
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the.</v>

864
00:34:46.430 --> 00:34:48.110
<v Speaker 2>It'S funny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you go to la,</v>

865
00:34:48.470 --> 00:34:51.050
<v Speaker 2>this is mostly talking about like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

866
00:34:51.560 --> 00:34:54.410
<v Speaker 2>people have that are trying to get into </v>
<v Speaker 2>the entertainment industry or whatever.</v>

867
00:34:54.650 --> 00:34:55.483
<v Speaker 2>It's like la is like a social climate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you take the crappy part of the </v>

868
00:34:58.940 --> 00:35:01.620
<v Speaker 2>social scene,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's people trying to socially climbing,</v>

869
00:35:01.650 --> 00:35:02.630
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you do for work,</v>

<v Speaker 2>try to play the game and have success in</v>

872
00:35:08.151 --> 00:35:09.920
<v Speaker 2>vegas has just sold out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

873
00:35:09.921 --> 00:35:10.754
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

<v Speaker 2>vegas sold out.</v>

877
00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:27.730
<v Speaker 2>Well it just doesn't seem like a vegas </v>
<v Speaker 2>has a,</v>

878
00:35:27.810 --> 00:35:28.643
<v Speaker 2>like</v>

879
00:35:28.970 --> 00:35:29.803
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of transient people and </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of people that are there </v>

880
00:35:31.521 --> 00:35:34.310
<v Speaker 4>just for the casinos.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whereas like any other city,</v>

881
00:35:34.810 --> 00:35:37.070
<v Speaker 4>if you live in chicago for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a town,</v>

882
00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:38.160
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a real city.</v>

883
00:35:38.430 --> 00:35:40.820
<v Speaker 4>People been there for generation after </v>
<v Speaker 4>generations,</v>

884
00:35:40.830 --> 00:35:43.020
<v Speaker 4>a lot of different businesses,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of variety to it.</v>

885
00:35:43.350 --> 00:35:44.183
<v Speaker 4>In vegas you got the hub which is all </v>
<v Speaker 4>the casinos and then you got the </v>

886
00:35:48.691 --> 00:35:52.140
<v Speaker 4>surrounding areas that are just sort of </v>
<v Speaker 4>feeding off of the casinos.</v>

887
00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:54.080
<v Speaker 4>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a weird gig.</v>

888
00:35:54.180 --> 00:35:55.710
<v Speaker 4>Weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Great.</v>

889
00:35:55.711 --> 00:35:57.440
<v Speaker 4>Great for short,</v>
<v Speaker 4>short times.</v>

890
00:35:57.460 --> 00:35:57.820
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

891
00:35:57.820 --> 00:36:01.150
<v Speaker 3>The one thing I would say it was cool </v>
<v Speaker 3>while you're there is,</v>

892
00:36:01.180 --> 00:36:03.790
<v Speaker 3>I mean sacramento's not necessarily a </v>
<v Speaker 3>destination spot.</v>

893
00:36:04.090 --> 00:36:06.580
<v Speaker 3>So while I was living there and people </v>
<v Speaker 3>knew that we were living there,</v>

894
00:36:06.790 --> 00:36:07.623

<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to learn if you don't </v>

1042
00:42:26.181 --> 00:42:27.440
<v Speaker 3>do something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They do.</v>

1043
00:42:27.470 --> 00:42:29.240
<v Speaker 3>They do some jobs they don't do any </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1044
00:42:29.300 --> 00:42:30.520
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't have like one,</v>

1045
00:42:30.521 --> 00:42:32.830
<v Speaker 3>one person hold mitts and one person </v>
<v Speaker 3>hold,</v>

1046
00:42:33.230 --> 00:42:34.940
<v Speaker 3>but he could do privates and stuff like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1047
00:42:34.970 --> 00:42:37.570
<v Speaker 3>IS it just like a liability thing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would imagine.</v>

1048
00:42:38.210 --> 00:42:39.410
<v Speaker 3>Probably worried.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1049
00:42:39.980 --> 00:42:43.400

<v Speaker 3>jujitsu and you learn great technIque.</v>

1050
00:42:43.700 --> 00:42:47.540
<v Speaker 1>It's a great idea too to have a gym </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's based around the ufc where people</v>

1051
00:42:47.541 --> 00:42:51.020
<v Speaker 1>were fans can go and learn that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff and get a great workout.</v>

<v Speaker 1>JusT floyd got them to drain himself.</v>

1071
00:43:44.390 --> 00:43:46.940

<v Speaker 1>sluggish.</v>

1074
00:43:51.621 --> 00:43:56.210
<v Speaker 1>And floyd is the best boxer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty much ever that he is boxed him up</v>

1081
00:44:12.150 --> 00:44:16.020
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it would be a good fight for the</v>

00:44:16.021 --> 00:44:18.210
<v Speaker 1>fans.</v>

1085
00:44:24.061 --> 00:44:25.950
<v Speaker 1>Like fucking julio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cesar chavez.</v>

1086
00:44:25.951 --> 00:44:26.880
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a savage.</v>

1087
00:44:26.890 --> 00:44:29.890
<v Speaker 1>He's a fucking animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Body puncher and ripping shots.</v>

1088
00:44:30.030 --> 00:44:31.680
<v Speaker 2>Well if is going to get it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cody.</v>

1089
00:44:33.060 --> 00:44:35.070
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think honestly canelo.</v>

1090
00:44:35.310 --> 00:44:37.560
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think,</v>

1091
00:44:37.561 --> 00:44:38.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

1092
00:44:38.080 --> 00:44:40.740
<v Speaker 2>a triple g is a beast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think</v>

1093
00:44:41.940 --> 00:44:43.600
<v Speaker 4>you like to know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why do you like to know on this?</v>

1094
00:44:44.110 --> 00:44:44.921
<v Speaker 2>I just like his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his,</v>

1095
00:44:44.921 --> 00:44:47.890
<v Speaker 2>his um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his pressure is body punches,</v>

1096
00:44:48.250 --> 00:44:49.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the,</v>

1097
00:44:49.210 --> 00:44:52.200
<v Speaker 2>how he flows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He throws a lot of hooks on it.</v>

1098
00:44:52.201 --> 00:44:54.670
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm a big hook guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>so like any,</v>

1099
00:44:54.671 --> 00:44:55.504
<v Speaker 2>like Mike Tyson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to watch all my stuff hooks and </v>

1100
00:44:58.001 --> 00:44:59.830
<v Speaker 2>canelo does too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1101
00:45:00.820 --> 00:45:03.790
<v Speaker 2>he throwS some creative stuff to die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I did that.</v>

1102
00:45:03.870 --> 00:45:07.060
<v Speaker 2>I started doing a move off of watching </v>
<v Speaker 2>canelo.</v>

1103
00:45:07.061 --> 00:45:10.150
<v Speaker 2>He throws like a fake hook to an upper </v>
<v Speaker 2>cut.</v>

1104
00:45:10.420 --> 00:45:11.253
<v Speaker 2>So it's like this and it goes like that </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the guy who covered here and it </v>

1105
00:45:13.541 --> 00:45:16.900
<v Speaker 2>comes right up the middle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean my didn't look as good as his.</v>

1106
00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:17.793
<v Speaker 2>I didn't punch against scotty jorgensen </v>
<v Speaker 2>when I find it looked like I was just </v>

1107
00:45:19.871 --> 00:45:20.830
<v Speaker 2>winding my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

1108
00:45:21.010 --> 00:45:23.590
<v Speaker 2>my arm up like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's like,</v>

1109
00:45:24.550 --> 00:45:26.140
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he has a bunch of little tricky,</v>

1110
00:45:26.141 --> 00:45:28.330
<v Speaker 2>subtle things he does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like canelo.</v>

1111
00:45:28.360 --> 00:45:30.850
<v Speaker 2>He also his ring generalship like that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>huge for me.</v>

1112
00:45:30.851 --> 00:45:34.480
<v Speaker 2>Like I caught you can knock people out </v>
<v Speaker 2>fast or have good combos,</v>

1113
00:45:34.481 --> 00:45:35.314
<v Speaker 2>but the way that you take the octagon or</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ring and stock them and then impose </v>

1114
00:45:40.601 --> 00:45:41.710
<v Speaker 2>your will on him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His,</v>

1115
00:45:41.770 --> 00:45:44.500
<v Speaker 2>his presence in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He knows where he's at all the time.</v>

1116
00:45:44.690 --> 00:45:45.523
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's interesting to me about this </v>

1117
00:45:46.191 --> 00:45:51.170
<v Speaker 4>fight is this is the first time that </v>
<v Speaker 4>he's fought a guy who's world class that</v>

1118
00:45:51.171 --> 00:45:55.490
<v Speaker 4>is a brutal power puncher like him who's</v>
<v Speaker 4>bigger than him,</v>

1119
00:45:55.580 --> 00:45:57.590
<v Speaker 4>who's going to come towards him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

1120
00:45:57.591 --> 00:45:59.870
<v Speaker 4>Whereas he fought floyd for.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a smaller guy,</v>

1121
00:45:59.871 --> 00:46:03.560
<v Speaker 4>but just way craftier and slicker with </v>
<v Speaker 4>the style and you know,</v>

1122
00:46:03.561 --> 00:46:04.394
<v Speaker 4>it was an interesting fight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but ultimately it wasn't like the most </v>

1123
00:46:06.651 --> 00:46:08.660
<v Speaker 4>exciting fight because floyd just kinda </v>
<v Speaker 4>outboxed him.</v>

1124
00:46:09.190 --> 00:46:11.060
<v Speaker 4>I think this is going to be a bang of my</v>
<v Speaker 4>fight.</v>

1125
00:46:11.210 --> 00:46:11.930
<v Speaker 4>I.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1126
00:46:11.930 --> 00:46:15.730
<v Speaker 4>I think you're going to come towards </v>
<v Speaker 4>each other and it's gonna get crazy for,</v>

1127
00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:17.990
<v Speaker 4>for real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is like the highest stakes fight in</v>

1128
00:46:17.991 --> 00:46:21.500
<v Speaker 4>boxing because you have two murderers </v>
<v Speaker 4>punchers in their prime.</v>

1129
00:46:21.800 --> 00:46:22.633
<v Speaker 4>Gennady golovkin undefeated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The only person canelo last two is </v>

1130
00:46:25.900 --> 00:46:27.860
<v Speaker 4>floyd.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was only last.</v>

1131
00:46:27.861 --> 00:46:28.694
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is the only last and it's been </v>

1132
00:46:29.141 --> 00:46:29.840
<v Speaker 4>decisions to use.</v>

1133
00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:31.040
<v Speaker 4>15 professional,</v>
<v Speaker 4>young,</v>

1134
00:46:31.130 --> 00:46:32.240
<v Speaker 4>50.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Phenomenal.</v>

1135
00:46:32.270 --> 00:46:33.520
<v Speaker 4>Phenomenal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1136
00:46:33.530 --> 00:46:34.363
<v Speaker 4>just such a good fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I cannot wait for this fight all amped </v>

1137
00:46:36.801 --> 00:46:37.460
<v Speaker 4>up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what I was with.</v>

1138
00:46:37.460 --> 00:46:39.090
<v Speaker 4>Oscar tweeted about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1139
00:46:39.110 --> 00:46:40.770

00:46:41.510 --> 00:46:43.940

<v Speaker 4>This is why they're all fools.</v>

1142
00:46:44.140 --> 00:46:45.560
<v Speaker 4>If,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if oscar just said,</v>

1143
00:46:45.561 --> 00:46:48.110
<v Speaker 4>this is great for boxing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is great for everybody,</v>

1144
00:46:48.120 --> 00:46:50.690
<v Speaker 4>then everybody would have been fine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Instead these guys create enemies.</v>

1145
00:46:50.980 --> 00:46:52.670
<v Speaker 4>Know and say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is a disgrace.</v>

<v Speaker 4>They're saying,</v>

00:46:55.040 --> 00:46:57.410
<v Speaker 4>floyd,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if fixed the fight and you know,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I aSked her is losing his mind.</v>

1149

00:47:19.461 --> 00:47:21.170
<v Speaker 4>It's so funny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's hilarious.</v>

1156
00:47:21.250 --> 00:47:23.270
<v Speaker 4>That's what happens when you have a half</v>
<v Speaker 4>a billion dollars.</v>

1157
00:47:23.670 --> 00:47:24.503
<v Speaker 4>You don't give a fuck I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well he didn't give a fuck in the </v>

1158
00:47:26.841 --> 00:47:27.674
<v Speaker 4>beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is why he was perfect for the ufc </v>

1159
00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:30.040
<v Speaker 4>picture.</v>

1160
00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:32.050
<v Speaker 1>He went right before he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1161
00:47:32.210 --> 00:47:36.190
<v Speaker 1>right after he did the whole deal where </v>
<v Speaker 1>they sold and everything he was on like,</v>

1162
00:47:36.460 --> 00:47:39.420
<v Speaker 1>and he was on some show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was just slouched over,</v>

1163
00:47:39.421 --> 00:47:43.150
<v Speaker 1>look like a like a pile of crap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I took a picture of it and I sent it</v>

1164
00:47:43.151 --> 00:47:43.691
<v Speaker 1>to him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

1165
00:47:43.691 --> 00:47:46.410
<v Speaker 1>bro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why don't you sit like you have $400,</v>

1166
00:47:46.411 --> 00:47:50.140
<v Speaker 1>million dollars in the thing or at least</v>
<v Speaker 1>investments of some fucking fitness shit</v>

1167
00:47:50.141 --> 00:47:50.974
<v Speaker 1>or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sent him a picture just all slumped </v>

1168
00:47:53.831 --> 00:47:56.560
<v Speaker 1>over like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's super stressed.</v>

1169
00:47:57.120 --> 00:47:57.953
<v Speaker 1>I think he's better now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that time was like a crazy ass </v>

1170
00:48:00.491 --> 00:48:01.324
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could you imagine you're about to get </v>

<v Speaker 1>And then how about afterwards all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit starts falling apart.</v>

1173
00:48:07.870 --> 00:48:10.780

<v Speaker 1>How are you doing?</v>

1212
00:49:55.120 --> 00:49:56.710
<v Speaker 1>I don't get it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can't.</v>

1213
00:49:56.840 --> 00:49:57.673
<v Speaker 1>The public.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1214
00:49:57.700 --> 00:50:00.420
<v Speaker 1>You can't contribute fickle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just decide.</v>

1215
00:50:00.760 --> 00:50:01.593
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They decide who they love and they </v>

1216
00:50:03.251 --> 00:50:05.470
<v Speaker 1>decide who they hate to tell you what </v>
<v Speaker 1>though?</v>

1217
00:50:05.471 --> 00:50:07.930
<v Speaker 1>John's speech after he beat dc was </v>
<v Speaker 1>beautiful.</v>

1218
00:50:08.030 --> 00:50:09.210
<v Speaker 1>That was great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was.</v>

1219
00:50:09.240 --> 00:50:10.073
<v Speaker 1>It was great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was followed up by a steroid </v>

1220
00:50:11.850 --> 00:50:13.540
<v Speaker 1>tests.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's so sad.</v>

1221
00:50:13.760 --> 00:50:16.060
<v Speaker 1>I've been looking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm hoping just like everybody else.</v>

1222
00:50:16.120 --> 00:50:16.953
<v Speaker 1>There was some sort of a fuck up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then we figured out that someThing </v>

1223
00:50:20.681 --> 00:50:22.180
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something was wrong.</v>

1224
00:50:22.780 --> 00:50:24.370
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't really followed it too much.</v>

1225
00:50:24.380 --> 00:50:27.200
<v Speaker 1>I don't really know the good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not good.</v>

1226
00:50:27.260 --> 00:50:28.093
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he tested positive for something that </v>

1227
00:50:29.271 --> 00:50:30.104
<v Speaker 1>only shows up in urine tests.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they did a urine test after the </v>

1228
00:50:33.130 --> 00:50:33.590
<v Speaker 1>way ends.</v>

1229
00:50:33.590 --> 00:50:37.040
<v Speaker 1>He tested positive for this stuff and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then they did a blood test and you know,</v>

1230
00:50:37.041 --> 00:50:38.360
<v Speaker 1>he's his campus saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1231
00:50:38.361 --> 00:50:40.610
<v Speaker 1>it's not in the blood test.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well they don't test for it in the blood</v>

1232
00:50:40.630 --> 00:50:41.463
<v Speaker 1>tests.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why they do a urine test and a </v>

1233
00:50:42.561 --> 00:50:44.710
<v Speaker 1>blood test.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a two different tests like d ball,</v>

1234
00:50:44.900 --> 00:50:48.200
<v Speaker 1>like the main tee ball team,</v>
<v Speaker 1>toronto ball or something like that.</v>

1235
00:50:48.201 --> 00:50:50.810
<v Speaker 1>At some it's a weird substance that not </v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people take.</v>

1236
00:50:51.560 --> 00:50:52.870
<v Speaker 1>So um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1237
00:50:52.900 --> 00:50:55.820
<v Speaker 1>apparently chael sonnen was talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it that if he's taken that like,</v>

1238
00:50:55.821 --> 00:50:59.870
<v Speaker 1>this is real old school steroid took a </v>
<v Speaker 1>short acting short,</v>

1239
00:50:59.930 --> 00:51:01.690
<v Speaker 1>short half life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Steroids</v>

1240
00:51:03.300 --> 00:51:04.320
<v Speaker 3>just me out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1241
00:51:04.500 --> 00:51:06.060
<v Speaker 3>It's sad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's sad.</v>

1242
00:51:06.250 --> 00:51:08.700
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just don't think I've been.</v>

1243
00:51:08.701 --> 00:51:10.590
<v Speaker 3>What's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are you proving?</v>

1244
00:51:10.591 --> 00:51:11.520
<v Speaker 3>That's my whole thing.</v>

1245
00:51:11.570 --> 00:51:12.403
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he must have felt like you needed some </v>

1246
00:51:13.731 --> 00:51:15.320
<v Speaker 1>sort of an edge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If he took it.</v>

1247
00:51:16.080 --> 00:51:19.010
<v Speaker 1>He took it or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the real problem is,</v>

1248
00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:19.873
<v Speaker 1>or was he taking stuff the whole time?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did he get involved with those power </v>

1249
00:51:23.361 --> 00:51:26.590
<v Speaker 1>lifter dudes and start taking shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>because remember he's got fucking suit.</v>

1250
00:51:26.700 --> 00:51:28.710
<v Speaker 3>Her dad was just massive.</v>

1251
00:51:28.800 --> 00:51:29.633
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he literally was going to </v>

1252
00:51:29.851 --> 00:51:31.900
<v Speaker 1>heavyweight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He looks huge.</v>

1253
00:51:33.050 --> 00:51:35.600
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to speculate at all really.</v>

1254
00:51:35.870 --> 00:51:37.280
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

1255
00:51:37.400 --> 00:51:38.070
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>

1256
00:51:38.070 --> 00:51:38.903
<v Speaker 1>but you were involved in the sport in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the early days when there was no </v>

1257
00:51:41.281 --> 00:51:42.540
<v Speaker 1>testing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just look at you.</v>

1258
00:51:42.780 --> 00:51:44.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean when you were,</v>

1259
00:51:44.941 --> 00:51:46.590
<v Speaker 1>when you were first finding like Kenya </v>
<v Speaker 1>cage,</v>

1260
00:51:46.591 --> 00:51:47.730
<v Speaker 1>was there any drug testing?</v>

1261
00:51:48.280 --> 00:51:49.510
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing.</v>

1262
00:51:49.580 --> 00:51:51.970
<v Speaker 3>Not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There wasn't any type of anything.</v>

1263
00:51:51.971 --> 00:51:54.580
<v Speaker 3>I mean it was illegal in California,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the,</v>

1264
00:51:54.581 --> 00:51:55.414
<v Speaker 3>the only reason we were fighting on </v>
<v Speaker 3>indian reservations because everything </v>

1265
00:51:57.761 --> 00:51:58.340
<v Speaker 3>was illegal.</v>

1266
00:51:58.340 --> 00:51:59.173
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that crazy that native americans </v>
<v Speaker 1>do whatever the fuck they want because </v>

1267
00:52:03.560 --> 00:52:05.740
<v Speaker 1>we screwed them so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's not a way.</v>

1268
00:52:05.960 --> 00:52:08.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's happened so many generations ago.</v>

1269
00:52:08.001 --> 00:52:09.560
<v Speaker 1>It's kind oF weird that it's still </v>
<v Speaker 1>around,</v>

1270
00:52:09.710 --> 00:52:13.910
<v Speaker 1>but they have like this sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have a nation inside a nation.</v>

1271
00:52:13.940 --> 00:52:15.800
<v Speaker 1>So it's very odd little situation</v>

1272
00:52:15.840 --> 00:52:16.673
<v Speaker 3>over in the u,</v>
<v Speaker 3>s we talk about the holocaust and what </v>

1273
00:52:18.391 --> 00:52:20.820
<v Speaker 3>happened over there and over in like </v>
<v Speaker 3>Germany,</v>

1274
00:52:20.821 --> 00:52:22.590
<v Speaker 3>they talk about what we did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the indians.</v>

1275
00:52:22.860 --> 00:52:23.693
<v Speaker 1>Well you know what we did at the indian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were here when it comes to like </v>

1276
00:52:27.751 --> 00:52:29.700
<v Speaker 1>genocide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what the biggest genocide was?</v>

1277
00:52:30.030 --> 00:52:31.130
<v Speaker 1>Disease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1278
00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:35.280
<v Speaker 1>Ninety percent of them were killed by </v>
<v Speaker 1>smallpox and all sorts of bugs that they</v>

1279
00:52:35.281 --> 00:52:36.114
<v Speaker 1>just had no resistance from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right when they first met the </v>

1280
00:52:39.061 --> 00:52:42.300
<v Speaker 1>europeans and it had nothing to do with </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a planned attack on them.</v>

1281
00:52:42.480 --> 00:52:44.970
<v Speaker 1>People were just dying off like crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what happened.</v>

1282
00:52:44.971 --> 00:52:46.110
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Terrific.</v>

1283
00:52:46.690 --> 00:52:47.810
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1284
00:52:47.820 --> 00:52:49.830
<v Speaker 1>but it's a thank god they have casinos.</v>

1285
00:52:51.420 --> 00:52:52.253

<v Speaker 3>northern coast,</v>

1288
00:53:02.420 --> 00:53:07.070

<v Speaker 3>You eat mostly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know Chad does that,</v>

1312
00:54:03.901 --> 00:54:05.460
<v Speaker 3>but tries to eat mostly food that he's</v>

1313
00:54:05.540 --> 00:54:09.760
<v Speaker 1>killed themselves as much as I can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ninety nine percent of the food I eat is</v>

1314
00:54:09.761 --> 00:54:12.580
<v Speaker 1>wild game other than vegetables.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1315
00:54:12.620 --> 00:54:13.241
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1316
00:54:13.241 --> 00:54:15.820
<v Speaker 1>if you could shoot an elk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like either those ell kids that are.</v>

1317
00:54:15.821 --> 00:54:18.340
<v Speaker 1>How back?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's 400 pounds of meat.</v>

1318
00:54:18.560 --> 00:54:20.550
<v Speaker 1>I give a lot of it to my friends who </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't hunt,</v>

1319
00:54:20.590 --> 00:54:21.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like elk.</v>

1320
00:54:22.060 --> 00:54:23.140
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

1321
00:54:23.350 --> 00:54:27.160
<v Speaker 1>that's enough meat for a year and then I</v>
<v Speaker 1>usually shoot a deer to a year.</v>

1322
00:54:27.780 --> 00:54:28.613
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's what trips me out about </v>

1323
00:54:29.161 --> 00:54:30.630
<v Speaker 3>people that are so against hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1324
00:54:30.631 --> 00:54:32.940
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a big hunter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>

1325
00:54:32.970 --> 00:54:37.260
<v Speaker 3>like the things that happened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like on the farm is where they're like,</v>

1326
00:54:37.670 --> 00:54:39.840
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have animals,</v>

1327
00:54:39.841 --> 00:54:41.820
<v Speaker 3>is cajun and try to feed him getting </v>
<v Speaker 3>fat.</v>

1328
00:54:41.821 --> 00:54:42.654
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's some nasty stuff and this is way </v>

1329
00:54:44.641 --> 00:54:46.920
<v Speaker 3>more humane and a healthier way to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1330
00:54:47.060 --> 00:54:50.030
<v Speaker 1>It's definitely healthier way to eat and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's definitely way more humane.</v>

1331
00:54:50.390 --> 00:54:51.223
<v Speaker 1>people love to point the finger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>90 seven percent of the people in this </v>

1332
00:54:53.331 --> 00:54:56.870
<v Speaker 1>country meet either that or they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>pescatarian and they eat,</v>

1333
00:54:57.130 --> 00:54:57.963
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's maybe three percent of the </v>

1334
00:54:59.481 --> 00:55:02.030
<v Speaker 1>people in this country that are vegans </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's a,</v>

1335
00:55:02.031 --> 00:55:03.830
<v Speaker 1>that's a small number.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

1336
00:55:03.860 --> 00:55:04.693
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get very vocal about it and the </v>

1337
00:55:06.830 --> 00:55:10.220
<v Speaker 1>best way for them to like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can find a person,</v>

1338
00:55:10.221 --> 00:55:11.054
<v Speaker 1>like say if you hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you hold a picture of a deer that you </v>

1339
00:55:12.321 --> 00:55:13.660
<v Speaker 1>shot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they found you,</v>

1340
00:55:13.661 --> 00:55:15.650
<v Speaker 1>you're you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the urine individually.</v>

1341
00:55:15.890 --> 00:55:19.880
<v Speaker 1>Whereas like if you have a steak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that steak was raised by a rancher,</v>

1342
00:55:19.881 --> 00:55:21.950
<v Speaker 1>it's on a ranch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who's the guy who shot at,</v>

1343
00:55:21.951 --> 00:55:23.240
<v Speaker 1>who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you got it.</v>

1344
00:55:23.241 --> 00:55:24.800
<v Speaker 1>A supermarket.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here it is,</v>

1345
00:55:25.070 --> 00:55:27.680
<v Speaker 1>is too many.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Too many people down the line.</v>

1346
00:55:27.710 --> 00:55:29.300
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't point to one person.</v>

1347
00:55:29.301 --> 00:55:34.010
<v Speaker 1>But if I see uriah faber or holding up a</v>
<v Speaker 1>doc that he shot like,</v>

1348
00:55:34.040 --> 00:55:34.930
<v Speaker 1>well that's you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1349
00:55:34.931 --> 00:55:37.830
<v Speaker 1>you killed that dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get the vegan cat lady after you.</v>

1350
00:55:37.840 --> 00:55:39.680
<v Speaker 1>Again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>

1351
00:55:39.681 --> 00:55:42.590
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

1352
00:55:42.710 --> 00:55:44.090
<v Speaker 1>That's a true bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1353
00:55:44.420 --> 00:55:45.500
<v Speaker 1>That's the true bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

1354
00:55:45.560 --> 00:55:46.393
<v Speaker 1>this bunch of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a community of people that think </v>

1355
00:55:47.750 --> 00:55:49.730
<v Speaker 1>it's a good idea to feed their cat vegan</v>
<v Speaker 1>food.</v>

1356
00:55:50.590 --> 00:55:53.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a whole move to feed cats,</v>

1357
00:55:53.841 --> 00:55:55.180
<v Speaker 1>vegan food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the cats can take it.</v>

1358
00:55:55.640 --> 00:55:57.470
<v Speaker 1>They go blind and have heart attacks and</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

1359
00:55:57.960 --> 00:55:58.880
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

1360
00:55:59.270 --> 00:56:00.103
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cats are supposed to eat something </v>

1361
00:56:00.891 --> 00:56:01.724
<v Speaker 1>called taurine that only exists in </v>
<v Speaker 1>animal food and like in an animal </v>

1362
00:56:06.081 --> 00:56:06.914
<v Speaker 1>protein,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cats are what's called an obligate </v>

1363
00:56:08.331 --> 00:56:09.164
<v Speaker 1>carnivore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means they can't eat anything </v>

1364
00:56:10.911 --> 00:56:13.160
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a dog.</v>

1365
00:56:13.190 --> 00:56:17.210
<v Speaker 1>Dogs can eat carrots and a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 1>other shit like dogs eat things.</v>

1366
00:56:17.550 --> 00:56:18.383
<v Speaker 1>You can eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dogs can eat some grains and potatoes </v>

1367
00:56:19.911 --> 00:56:21.050
<v Speaker 1>and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fine for them.</v>

1368
00:56:21.230 --> 00:56:24.850
<v Speaker 1>They mostly eat meat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like dogs are mostly carnivores,</v>

1369
00:56:25.120 --> 00:56:28.180
<v Speaker 1>but they can mix their diet up a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit and still be okay.</v>

1370
00:56:28.240 --> 00:56:29.570
<v Speaker 1>Not cats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

<v Speaker 1>on instagram.</v>

1376
00:56:44.650 --> 00:56:45.850
<v Speaker 1>It's based on the total truth</v>

1377
00:56:45.850 --> 00:56:47.710
<v Speaker 3>store and it was one of the vegan cat </v>

1380
00:56:51.200 --> 00:56:52.033
<v Speaker 1>adult,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's just the community of people </v>

1381

<v Speaker 1>that that feed their cats vegan food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are fucking completely there.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Is that her right there?</v>

1467
01:01:04.570 --> 01:01:05.403
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1468
01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:09.300
<v Speaker 2>Just sitting on the stoop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is after she wiped up.</v>

1469
01:01:09.330 --> 01:01:10.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh jesus.</v>

1470
01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:11.490
<v Speaker 2>She didn't wipe up.</v>

1471
01:01:14.210 --> 01:01:19.210
<v Speaker 2>That's the christ itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus christ.</v>

1472
01:01:19.741 --> 01:01:20.574
<v Speaker 2>She missed everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's weird that she knew exactly where </v>

1473
01:01:23.371 --> 01:01:28.371
<v Speaker 2>that bathroom is at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've just sat them bath.</v>

1474
01:01:30.140 --> 01:01:33.030
<v Speaker 2>It was not there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The heroes.</v>

1475
01:01:33.180 --> 01:01:35.140
<v Speaker 2>Had she ever been over your house for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>party or something?</v>

1476
01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:37.170
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So she just was in the neighborhood.</v>

1477
01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:38.033
<v Speaker 2>So I live on a corner and there's maybe </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's maybe like it comes to truth </v>

1478
01:01:41.610 --> 01:01:44.790
<v Speaker 2>locked down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a bar called,</v>

1479
01:01:44.791 --> 01:01:47.800
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>called uh,</v>

1480
01:01:48.130 --> 01:01:49.290
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cheaters,</v>

1481
01:01:49.650 --> 01:01:52.680
<v Speaker 2>I think she was drunk from that walk in </v>
<v Speaker 2>and had it really take a shit.</v>

1482
01:01:52.681 --> 01:01:54.510
<v Speaker 2>There's a bar called cheaters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1483
01:01:54.890 --> 01:01:59.390
<v Speaker 2>Because it's kind of like the ashley </v>
<v Speaker 2>madison and bars go there to hook.</v>

1484
01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:00.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>

1485
01:02:00.450 --> 01:02:01.283
<v Speaker 2>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1486
01:02:01.670 --> 01:02:06.450
<v Speaker 2>I really wouldn't go there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>

1487
01:02:09.210 --> 01:02:12.240
<v Speaker 2>if you go to that bar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look like you know what's going on.</v>

1491
01:02:22.741 --> 01:02:25.140
<v Speaker 3>so I don't know what it's all about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The dude's name is cheater.</v>

1492
01:02:25.790 --> 01:02:29.540

<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1498
01:02:43.770 --> 01:02:45.270

<v Speaker 3>It looks angry.</v>

1499
01:02:46.850 --> 01:02:47.683
<v Speaker 3>Fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is right doWn the street from </v>

1500
01:02:49.341 --> 01:02:50.280
<v Speaker 3>your house that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1501
01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:52.770
<v Speaker 3>that bathroom was not there before I got</v>
<v Speaker 3>the house.</v>

1502
01:02:52.771 --> 01:02:53.604
<v Speaker 3>I added that on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>poured a slab and built back and </v>

1503
01:02:55.111 --> 01:02:58.230
<v Speaker 3>everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I don't know how the hell she,</v>

1504
01:02:58.380 --> 01:03:01.800
<v Speaker 3>she dead ended in the end of the house </v>
<v Speaker 3>and just took a left.</v>

1505
01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:02.993
<v Speaker 1>so she just got lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I found the bathroom shit all over the </v>

1506
01:03:05.041 --> 01:03:07.320
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever contact her afterwards?</v>

1507
01:03:07.321 --> 01:03:08.360
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever lie?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1508
01:03:08.390 --> 01:03:10.110
<v Speaker 1>She ever contact you and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1509
01:03:10.111 --> 01:03:11.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shit all over your house.</v>

1510
01:03:11.950 --> 01:03:15.900

<v Speaker 1>tmz and all these different websites.</v>

1511
01:03:15.910 --> 01:03:19.020
<v Speaker 1>I think she reached out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think again,</v>

1512
01:03:19.350 --> 01:03:22.440
<v Speaker 1>we cut that one off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Girl gets into a 12 step program.</v>

1513
01:03:22.441 --> 01:03:23.274
<v Speaker 1>You will be one of the first people she </v>
<v Speaker 1>apologized to say I gotta make it right </v>

1514
01:03:26.100 --> 01:03:27.570
<v Speaker 1>with all the people that are wrong in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the past.</v>

1515
01:03:27.900 --> 01:03:28.733
<v Speaker 3>If she's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's someone in the neighborhood and I </v>

1516
01:03:30.881 --> 01:03:35.050
<v Speaker 3>don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the truth is like she went into that</v>

1517
01:03:35.051 --> 01:03:36.490
<v Speaker 3>bathroom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like she was just drawn,</v>

1518
01:03:36.491 --> 01:03:38.370
<v Speaker 3>like how could she,</v>
<v Speaker 3>could she have known</v>

1519
01:03:38.420 --> 01:03:40.130
<v Speaker 1>if you know my house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm saying.</v>

1520
01:03:40.700 --> 01:03:44.690
<v Speaker 1>I always ask them too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy,</v>

1521
01:03:45.100 --> 01:03:49.510
<v Speaker 3>mexican guy that was working for me and </v>
<v Speaker 3>he had an issue.</v>

1522
01:03:49.511 --> 01:03:50.344
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he would do the lacquer on all my </v>

1523
01:03:51.371 --> 01:03:52.204
<v Speaker 3>cabinets and everything and so he took </v>
<v Speaker 3>like an extra month and he would get in </v>

1524
01:03:56.741 --> 01:03:57.574
<v Speaker 3>there and I go into the house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was being built and he'd be passed </v>

<v Speaker 3>out on the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the floor.</v>

1526
01:04:01.331 --> 01:04:03.610
<v Speaker 3>He'd just get high as fuck and like pass</v>
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>

1527
01:04:03.611 --> 01:04:05.710

<v Speaker 3>when he was,</v>

1528
01:04:06.010 --> 01:04:07.540
<v Speaker 3>he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stay the night at the house,</v>

1529
01:04:07.541 --> 01:04:08.374

<v Speaker 3>Maybe He was having this chubby check </v>

<v Speaker 3>Help.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something's got to help.</v>

01:05:58.781 --> 01:06:00.730
<v Speaker 3>A little like cryo helps.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you do that at all?</v>

1570
01:06:01.660 --> 01:06:03.400
<v Speaker 3>I've done it a couple times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not like,</v>

1571
01:06:03.520 --> 01:06:07.210
<v Speaker 3>it's not a thing that I'm adamant about </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I think is good,</v>

1572
01:06:07.510 --> 01:06:08.343
<v Speaker 3>which I would've liked to do more of </v>
<v Speaker 3>throughout my career is the hyperbaric </v>

1573
01:06:10.631 --> 01:06:14.050
<v Speaker 3>chambers that after the aldo fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right with your leg,</v>

1574
01:06:14.320 --> 01:06:18.160
<v Speaker 3>with after the aldo fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>after the Mike Brown fight,</v>

1575
01:06:18.161 --> 01:06:21.070
<v Speaker 3>like you broke your hand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>broke my hand and had surgery.</v>

1576
01:06:21.430 --> 01:06:22.263
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I would use that just as regular </v>

1577
01:06:24.521 --> 01:06:24.640
<v Speaker 3>bit.</v>

1578
01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:25.473
<v Speaker 3>And then tj dillashaw actually got one </v>
<v Speaker 3>and had it at his house in his garage </v>

1579
01:06:29.110 --> 01:06:32.350
<v Speaker 3>brewing like in sacramento.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He and he had like a certified,</v>

1580
01:06:32.351 --> 01:06:34.550
<v Speaker 3>him and his wife got certified to do it </v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1581
01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:36.250
<v Speaker 3>and he would just like chilling that </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

1582
01:06:36.251 --> 01:06:37.084
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so what does the hyperbaric chamber </v>

1583
01:06:37.961 --> 01:06:41.440
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like oxygen rich environment,</v>

1584
01:06:41.441 --> 01:06:41.940
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1585
01:06:41.940 --> 01:06:45.730
<v Speaker 3>So it's high oxygen rich environment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it basically like it can,</v>

1586
01:06:45.731 --> 01:06:46.564
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it does like the same thing that red </v>

1587
01:06:47.970 --> 01:06:51.370
<v Speaker 3>blood cells to do like transport things </v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

1588
01:06:51.520 --> 01:06:53.590
<v Speaker 3>to your body fat and help you heal </v>
<v Speaker 3>faster.</v>

1589
01:06:53.591 --> 01:06:57.870
<v Speaker 3>So like there's high altitude which </v>
<v Speaker 3>helps you get acclimated and,</v>

1590
01:06:57.900 --> 01:06:58.800
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1591
01:06:59.290 --> 01:07:00.123
<v Speaker 3>and make more blood cells yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is just like helping pass </v>

1592
01:07:03.851 --> 01:07:04.684
<v Speaker 3>things through.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a hyper oxygenated </v>

1593
01:07:06.610 --> 01:07:07.810
<v Speaker 3>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you,</v>

1594
01:07:08.040 --> 01:07:10.780
<v Speaker 3>what do you feel like it did for you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It healed me faster,</v>

1595
01:07:10.781 --> 01:07:12.490
<v Speaker 3>so that's the first that I never.</v>

1596
01:07:12.490 --> 01:07:15.190
<v Speaker 3>I never been like a big strength and </v>
<v Speaker 3>conditioning guy even in,</v>

1597
01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:16.300
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in wrestling,</v>

1598
01:07:16.320 --> 01:07:20.500
<v Speaker 3>in college because I was always cutting </v>
<v Speaker 3>weight so I felt like,</v>

1599
01:07:21.640 --> 01:07:22.690
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1600
01:07:22.900 --> 01:07:24.850
<v Speaker 3>I've always been really strong for my </v>
<v Speaker 3>size.</v>

1601
01:07:24.851 --> 01:07:27.340
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't one of my tHings that I needed</v>
<v Speaker 3>to work on necessarily.</v>

1602
01:07:27.341 --> 01:07:30.580
<v Speaker 3>I was working on technique or working on</v>
<v Speaker 3>this or fluidity or whatever.</v>

1603
01:07:30.850 --> 01:07:32.670
<v Speaker 3>So I started.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I broke my hands,</v>

1604
01:07:32.680 --> 01:07:36.550
<v Speaker 3>I started doing a heavy lifting regimen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used to not like to do lifts,</v>

1605
01:07:36.570 --> 01:07:37.403
<v Speaker 3>like squats and stuff like that because </v>
<v Speaker 3>I would get so sore I couldn't do all </v>

1606
01:07:39.101 --> 01:07:42.490
<v Speaker 3>the shit I like to do like wrestle and </v>
<v Speaker 3>run and things like that.</v>

1607
01:07:42.820 --> 01:07:43.653
<v Speaker 3>So I was going to heal my hand while I </v>
<v Speaker 3>was doing these heavy workouts with my </v>

1608
01:07:46.391 --> 01:07:47.970
<v Speaker 3>trainer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kept asking me like,</v>

1609
01:07:48.250 --> 01:07:49.270
<v Speaker 3>am I sore?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

1610
01:07:49.271 --> 01:07:50.104
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sore.</v>

1611
01:07:50.290 --> 01:07:52.810
<v Speaker 3>We finally put it together because of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the hyperbaric chamber.</v>

1612
01:07:53.140 --> 01:07:56.140
<v Speaker 3>Like I was like hyper healing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>

1613
01:07:56.560 --> 01:07:57.393
<v Speaker 3>like I would do a hard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hard workout and never get sore because </v>

1614
01:07:59.411 --> 01:08:02.200
<v Speaker 3>I would go into the oxygen chamber.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My schedule just worked out.</v>

1615
01:08:02.201 --> 01:08:04.510
<v Speaker 3>I was going in there quick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>

1616
01:08:04.600 --> 01:08:06.880
<v Speaker 3>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is there any downside to doing it?</v>

1617
01:08:07.410 --> 01:08:08.510
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no.</v>

1618
01:08:08.580 --> 01:08:09.413
<v Speaker 3>Well the downside is it's expensive and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the same reason why insurance </v>

1619
01:08:14.930 --> 01:08:16.220
<v Speaker 3>didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't</v>

1620
01:08:16.220 --> 01:08:17.840
<v Speaker 1>pass it to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be insured.</v>

1621
01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:18.913
<v Speaker 1>So like there was a session and it can </v>
<v Speaker 1>be as much as 200 bucks and I a session </v>

1622
01:08:23.590 --> 01:08:25.490
<v Speaker 1>for an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how many sessions were you doing?</v>

1623
01:08:26.690 --> 01:08:29.870
<v Speaker 1>I would get it to where I was doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1624
01:08:30.620 --> 01:08:32.570
<v Speaker 1>like four sessions a week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dammit.</v>

1625
01:08:32.600 --> 01:08:35.720
<v Speaker 1>Insurance wasn't paying for this know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ufc would pay for it.</v>

1626
01:08:35.840 --> 01:08:37.310
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's nice.</v>

1627
01:08:37.340 --> 01:08:39.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's so like,</v>

1628
01:08:39.560 --> 01:08:40.700
<v Speaker 1>is this something they have set up at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>

1629
01:08:40.701 --> 01:08:42.920
<v Speaker 1>You have the new ufc performance center?</v>

1630
01:08:43.720 --> 01:08:44.553
<v Speaker 5>I think they have a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all that stuff there and I know the </v>

1631
01:08:46.420 --> 01:08:49.540
<v Speaker 5>underground treadmills,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the high altitude a building.</v>

1632
01:08:49.541 --> 01:08:52.450
<v Speaker 5>I've used their pet a couple of times.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm just,</v>

1633
01:08:52.510 --> 01:08:55.450
<v Speaker 5>we have a very fortunate with russ back </v>
<v Speaker 5>in sacramento,</v>

1634
01:08:55.451 --> 01:08:59.290
<v Speaker 5>eldorado hills that he does all that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I use hyperbaric chamber as well.</v>

1635
01:08:59.350 --> 01:09:01.740
<v Speaker 5>I had the whole whole last year.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what?</v>

1636
01:09:01.741 --> 01:09:05.710
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes you kick someone wrong angles </v>
<v Speaker 5>messed up for two,</v>

1637
01:09:05.711 --> 01:09:06.544
<v Speaker 5>three days.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would go on there that day and </v>

1638
01:09:07.811 --> 01:09:10.450
<v Speaker 5>literally you could put weight on it and</v>
<v Speaker 5>move around and be fine.</v>

1639
01:09:10.710 --> 01:09:14.550
<v Speaker 1>What they use it for his brain trauma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It helps heal your brain.</v>

1640
01:09:14.551 --> 01:09:17.820
<v Speaker 1>Like they'll play your ons and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the same thing that they do for the</v>

1641
01:09:17.821 --> 01:09:20.310
<v Speaker 1>bends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When somebody goes and does deep sea and</v>

1642
01:09:20.320 --> 01:09:23.100
<v Speaker 1>they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They feel like deep sea diving,</v>

1643
01:09:23.340 --> 01:09:24.173
<v Speaker 1>they have to put them in a hyperbaric </v>
<v Speaker 1>chamber to like acclimate them to like </v>

1644
01:09:28.110 --> 01:09:28.943
<v Speaker 1>heal them from coming up too fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's like a real science </v>

1645
01:09:31.711 --> 01:09:33.060
<v Speaker 1>behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's no.</v>

1646
01:09:33.061 --> 01:09:35.140
<v Speaker 1>I've heard about people using it for </v>
<v Speaker 1>breaks,</v>

1647
01:09:35.350 --> 01:09:38.100
<v Speaker 1>bone breaks and having some really quick</v>
<v Speaker 1>recovery.</v>

1648
01:09:38.420 --> 01:09:40.530
<v Speaker 1>I've just never experienced it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should do it.</v>

1649
01:09:40.750 --> 01:09:41.583
<v Speaker 1>I feel like why would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine it'd be just a good </v>

1650
01:09:42.901 --> 01:09:43.734
<v Speaker 1>thing to do all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I wonder if there's any negative </v>

1651
01:09:45.271 --> 01:09:47.490
<v Speaker 1>effects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there is,</v>

1652
01:09:47.491 --> 01:09:48.930
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1653
01:09:48.931 --> 01:09:49.421
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

1654
01:09:49.421 --> 01:09:54.120
<v Speaker 1>they're doing it for autistic kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for people with lyme disease.</v>

1655
01:09:54.150 --> 01:09:56.280
<v Speaker 1>Lyme disease is a big one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She uses.</v>

1656
01:09:56.281 --> 01:09:57.510
<v Speaker 1>that stuff's scary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1657
01:09:57.570 --> 01:09:58.403
<v Speaker 1>There's so many fucking people that have</v>
<v Speaker 1>that and don't even know you're tired </v>

1658
01:10:00.410 --> 01:10:01.243
<v Speaker 1>all the time and broken down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't understand that their immune </v>

1659
01:10:03.361 --> 01:10:05.760
<v Speaker 1>system is devastated by ticks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1660
01:10:06.860 --> 01:10:08.720
<v Speaker 1>There's a thing called the rocky </v>
<v Speaker 1>mountain tick,</v>

1661
01:10:09.600 --> 01:10:11.130
<v Speaker 1>rocky mountain flee or something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1662
01:10:11.490 --> 01:10:13.290
<v Speaker 1>I think it's rocky mount,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

1663
01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:15.420
<v Speaker 1>there's a um.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh no,</v>

1664
01:10:15.450 --> 01:10:17.310
<v Speaker 1>that's not it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the lone star tick.</v>

1665
01:10:17.580 --> 01:10:18.413
<v Speaker 1>There's a disease that people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting that makes you allergic to red </v>

1666
01:10:21.871 --> 01:10:23.280
<v Speaker 1>meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

1667
01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:25.980
<v Speaker 1>And then getting it from ticks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a trip.</v>

1668
01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:27.233
<v Speaker 1>You take a tick bite and you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>realize anything even happened and you </v>

1669
01:10:30.391 --> 01:10:32.220
<v Speaker 1>go to eat meat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you cheeseburger,</v>

1670
01:10:32.230 --> 01:10:34.890
<v Speaker 1>something to get really sick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your immune system gets devastated.</v>

1671
01:10:34.891 --> 01:10:35.724
<v Speaker 1>There it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The lone star tick injects alpha gal </v>

1672
01:10:38.100 --> 01:10:38.933
<v Speaker 1>into the bloodstream and then the immune</v>
<v Speaker 1>system releases immunoglobulin e </v>

1673
01:10:42.511 --> 01:10:46.290
<v Speaker 1>antibodies to fight this foreign sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After this reaction,</v>

1674
01:10:46.291 --> 01:10:47.124
<v Speaker 1>the future intake of mammal meet with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same alpha gal will result in an </v>

1675
01:10:51.150 --> 01:10:56.150
<v Speaker 1>allergy reaction because meat has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like alpha go lactose.</v>

1676
01:10:57.210 --> 01:11:01.200
<v Speaker 1>They're saying alpha gal as short.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I forget what it actually is.</v>

1677
01:11:02.490 --> 01:11:03.780
<v Speaker 1>I forgot the actual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1678
01:11:04.100 --> 01:11:05.580
<v Speaker 1>so does It.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does it say there?</v>

1679
01:11:05.640 --> 01:11:07.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Galactose.</v>

1680
01:11:07.080 --> 01:11:09.060
<v Speaker 1>Alpha one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Three.</v>

1681
01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:12.770
<v Speaker 1>Galactose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the shit that lives in later.</v>

1682
01:11:13.960 --> 01:11:14.793
<v Speaker 1>Tigers</v>

<v Speaker 2>one.</v>

1693
01:11:40.650 --> 01:11:42.180
<v Speaker 2>I've been doing the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1694
01:11:42.390 --> 01:11:44.310
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the salt.</v>

1695
01:11:44.490 --> 01:11:47.910
<v Speaker 2>What's the thing you've been doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Float to do that a long time.</v>

1696
01:11:48.330 --> 01:11:50.490
<v Speaker 2>And they finally got one right next to </v>

<v Speaker 2>They have that hyper,</v>

1701
01:12:00.930 --> 01:12:03.420

<v Speaker 2>It's cool.</v>

1703
01:12:05.161 --> 01:12:05.994
<v Speaker 2>I mean the only problem is I have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>have a quiet mind enabled to go to get </v>

1704
01:12:09.601 --> 01:12:10.320
<v Speaker 2>the most out of it.</v>

1705
01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:12.510
<v Speaker 2>Like if I'm stressing about something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go in there.</v>

1706
01:12:12.930 --> 01:12:16.170
<v Speaker 2>I just like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I ended up like just thinking the</v>

1707
01:12:16.171 --> 01:12:17.090
<v Speaker 2>whole time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

01:12:17.100 --> 01:12:18.780
<v Speaker 2>I have to be at a right place to go in </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

1709
01:12:18.781 --> 01:12:20.820
<v Speaker 2>I think yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's a personality thing.</v>

1710
01:12:20.821 --> 01:12:23.190
<v Speaker 2>Like do you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I like it when I can relax,</v>

1711
01:12:23.191 --> 01:12:25.500
<v Speaker 2>but like if I have like a lot going on </v>
<v Speaker 2>my mind,</v>

1712
01:12:25.620 --> 01:12:30.450
<v Speaker 2>I can't just shut it down and then I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuck in this like a lingus thinking and</v>

1713
01:12:30.451 --> 01:12:32.400
<v Speaker 2>I can't and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I gotta get out of here and go take care</v>

1714
01:12:32.401 --> 01:12:33.330
<v Speaker 2>of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take care of that,</v>

1715
01:12:34.110 --> 01:12:35.700
<v Speaker 2>but what I want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm able to chill.</v>

1716
01:12:35.701 --> 01:12:37.650
<v Speaker 2>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know cody uses it a lot.</v>

1717
01:12:37.710 --> 01:12:40.410
<v Speaker 2>I use it a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I one time I had a close call,</v>

1718
01:12:40.440 --> 01:12:44.840
<v Speaker 2>like a astral projection.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it was crazy.</v>

1719
01:12:44.870 --> 01:12:45.703
<v Speaker 2>I went in there.</v>

1720
01:12:46.050 --> 01:12:49.320
<v Speaker 2>Basically it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was explained to the guy that owned it</v>

1721
01:12:49.321 --> 01:12:50.880
<v Speaker 2>at the time because I quit going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1722
01:12:50.881 --> 01:12:54.060
<v Speaker 2>one time it happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like grim reaper came over top of</v>

1723
01:12:54.061 --> 01:12:54.730
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No shit.</v>

1724
01:12:54.730 --> 01:12:56.310
<v Speaker 2>It was like trying to push me down and </v>
<v Speaker 2>drown me,</v>

1725
01:12:56.311 --> 01:12:58.800
<v Speaker 2>but I was like sleeping and like a deep </v>
<v Speaker 2>trance.</v>

1726
01:12:58.801 --> 01:13:02.790
<v Speaker 2>Like I'd always felt like my body would </v>
<v Speaker 2>vibrate and you're like kept coming.</v>

1727
01:13:02.791 --> 01:13:06.330

<v Speaker 2>such an sleep deep trance.</v>

1728
01:13:06.690 --> 01:13:09.690
<v Speaker 2>I come back up and I'd finally calm </v>
<v Speaker 2>myself back down,</v>

1729
01:13:10.010 --> 01:13:14.030
<v Speaker 2>relaxed and would drift off into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>float and they bone would come like just</v>

1730
01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:17.280
<v Speaker 2>the whole time I could feel that hot </v>
<v Speaker 2>coils on my back with my face,</v>

1734
01:13:21.991 --> 01:13:24.100
<v Speaker 2>I finally got up and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>god,</v>

1735
01:13:24.230 --> 01:13:25.960
<v Speaker 2>I really felt like something was trying </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do.</v>

1736
01:13:26.010 --> 01:13:26.843
<v Speaker 2>Someone's trying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what I was going on and </v>

1737
01:13:28.261 --> 01:13:31.290
<v Speaker 2>anxiety or something crazy,</v>

1739
01:13:34.550 --> 01:13:36.080

01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:39.680
<v Speaker 2>It has the blue light in there and I got</v>
<v Speaker 2>the music going and I was just spinning,</v>

1741
01:13:39.850 --> 01:13:42.720
<v Speaker 2>lIke bouncing off this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just staying busy.</v>

1742
01:13:42.721 --> 01:13:46.810
<v Speaker 2>I could chill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not good at relaxing these days when</v>

1743
01:13:46.850 --> 01:13:47.683
<v Speaker 2>he would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would think you'd be better at </v>

1744
01:13:48.571 --> 01:13:50.730
<v Speaker 2>relaxing now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now that you're retired from fighting.</v>

1745
01:13:50.930 --> 01:13:54.060
<v Speaker 2>Oh no way man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to.</v>

<v Speaker 2>and I'm like,</v>

1747
01:13:57.570 --> 01:13:59.730
<v Speaker 2>I'll have to like stop and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look guys,</v>

1748
01:14:00.330 --> 01:14:01.830
<v Speaker 2>we're having a meeting right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

1749
01:14:01.860 --> 01:14:04.890
<v Speaker 2>let's cover this over like jujitsu </v>
<v Speaker 2>started 20 minutes ago.</v>

1750
01:14:04.891 --> 01:14:07.140
<v Speaker 2>I need to get that workout in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise I'm like,</v>

1751
01:14:07.540 --> 01:14:08.191
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1752
01:14:08.191 --> 01:14:12.250
<v Speaker 2>you create yourself a regimen throughout</v>
<v Speaker 2>your life of working out a couple times</v>

1753
01:14:12.250 --> 01:14:13.083
<v Speaker 3>a day and that's what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you go in and try to have </v>

1754
01:14:14.501 --> 01:14:15.334
<v Speaker 3>meetings all day and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and like this and put this fire out and </v>

1755
01:14:19.121 --> 01:14:19.954
<v Speaker 3>get on this call.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's like I was doing that together </v>

1756
01:14:22.601 --> 01:14:23.434
<v Speaker 3>with being a full time athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So finding the balance has been the key </v>

1757
01:14:26.081 --> 01:14:26.600
<v Speaker 3>for me.</v>

1758
01:14:26.600 --> 01:14:27.433
<v Speaker 1>Well for you there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there probably Is like a requirement </v>

1759
01:14:29.001 --> 01:14:31.370
<v Speaker 1>that your body has to like blow out </v>
<v Speaker 1>stage two</v>

1760
01:14:31.660 --> 01:14:33.640
<v Speaker 3>and that and that's another thing with </v>
<v Speaker 3>the diet.</v>

1761
01:14:33.641 --> 01:14:38.641
<v Speaker 3>Like he was asking about his diet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I had been like an overeater,</v>

1762
01:14:39.731 --> 01:14:41.980
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't like stuff stuff and he was </v>
<v Speaker 3>calling me,</v>

1763
01:14:42.130 --> 01:14:42.963
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>making fun of me for eating all the </v>

1764
01:14:43.841 --> 01:14:44.674
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like just constantly eating and </v>

1765
01:14:46.241 --> 01:14:49.660
<v Speaker 3>whatnot because I'm used to doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You burn so many calories in the day.</v>

1766
01:14:49.990 --> 01:14:50.823
<v Speaker 3>Now I have to like be mindful of not </v>
<v Speaker 3>like overeating because I'm not putting </v>

1767
01:14:54.070 --> 01:14:55.900
<v Speaker 3>out the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>otherwise I feel like crap.</v>

1768
01:14:56.380 --> 01:15:00.010
<v Speaker 3>You don't want your fat tire and you're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

01:15:00.011 --> 01:15:01.990
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'm not worried about getting fat</v>
<v Speaker 3>necessarily.</v>

1770
01:15:01.991 --> 01:15:04.210
<v Speaker 3>It's more of just like feeling like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit,</v>

<v Speaker 3>He tries to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he tries the like accentuated like,</v>

1774
01:15:12.010 --> 01:15:15.070
<v Speaker 3>like if he knows that I'm like man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a little thick and then they'll wait</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

1780
01:15:24.950 --> 01:15:26.930
<v Speaker 1>And you went to a decision with him,</v>

01:15:27.330 --> 01:15:31.020
<v Speaker 1>that's checked six overtime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's gigantic.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That guy is fucking legit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1783
01:15:33.720 --> 01:15:34.553
<v Speaker 1>He's pretty good for garlic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You didn't specialize in that and </v>

1784
01:15:36.550 --> 01:15:38.610
<v Speaker 1>specialized in mma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1785
01:15:38.611 --> 01:15:39.444
<v Speaker 1>and coming from a wrestling background,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously you have a grappling </v>

1786
01:15:41.251 --> 01:15:45.000
<v Speaker 1>background and you were great at </v>
<v Speaker 1>submissions in your mma career.</v>

1787
01:15:45.360 --> 01:15:49.620
<v Speaker 1>But to take on a guy that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that accomplished as a grappler,</v>

1788
01:15:49.800 --> 01:15:50.570
<v Speaker 1>that's gigantic.</v>

<v Speaker 3>it was cool.</v>

1790
01:15:51.621 --> 01:15:52.454
<v Speaker 3>I mean I always tell these guys and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually believe it and that's what I </v>

1791
01:15:55.671 --> 01:15:58.910
<v Speaker 3>said about connor too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you have to in our sport,</v>

1792
01:15:58.911 --> 01:16:01.280
<v Speaker 3>you have to be able to go with a world </v>
<v Speaker 3>champion,</v>

1793
01:16:01.550 --> 01:16:03.650
<v Speaker 3>jujitsu player,</v>
<v Speaker 3>world champion wrestler,</v>

1794

<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1796
01:16:09.140 --> 01:16:11.390
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the difference with our sport and</v>

1797
01:16:11.391 --> 01:16:12.224
<v Speaker 3>that's why it's so impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that's what I was saying for </v>

1798
01:16:14.001 --> 01:16:16.490
<v Speaker 3>these guys and I didn't even for that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for that.</v>

1799
01:16:16.491 --> 01:16:19.070
<v Speaker 3>I was going to train real hard to take </v>
<v Speaker 3>it real serious.</v>

1800
01:16:19.280 --> 01:16:23.720
<v Speaker 3>But then I got this the rampage movie </v>
<v Speaker 3>role with in the rocks new movie,</v>

1801
01:16:23.721 --> 01:16:24.554
<v Speaker 3>so I went and spent 10 days in atlanta </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then I had told Chad before that I </v>

1802
01:16:28.011 --> 01:16:30.650
<v Speaker 3>would do this charity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a fishing ship with these,</v>

<v Speaker 3>the injured vets.</v>

1804
01:16:32.930 --> 01:16:36.830
<v Speaker 3>And so we did that for three days and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>went in there looking like a chubby.</v>

1805
01:16:36.831 --> 01:16:39.330
<v Speaker 3>There's a picture of me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I look so freaking chubby in that,</v>

1806
01:16:39.390 --> 01:16:41.570
<v Speaker 3>in that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And didn't even train,</v>

01:16:41.571 --> 01:16:42.404
<v Speaker 3>but I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

01:16:43.700 --> 01:16:45.920
<v Speaker 3>I take a lot of pride in my grappling </v>
<v Speaker 3>ability.</v>

1810

<v Speaker 3>sport.</v>

1812
01:16:48.980 --> 01:16:51.110

<v Speaker 5>like he's an athlete,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's not a fighter,</v>

1948
01:21:58.530 --> 01:22:00.750
<v Speaker 5>but if he's fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's a fighter.</v>

1949
01:22:00.930 --> 01:22:02.250
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so what's the difference?</v>

1950
01:22:02.480 --> 01:22:03.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

1951
01:22:04.360 --> 01:22:08.410
<v Speaker 2>I think dominic actually showed like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he got to brave with cody.</v>

1952
01:22:08.620 --> 01:22:10.090
<v Speaker 2>There's a couple times where he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

1953
01:22:10.091 --> 01:22:10.924
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to get in there and show them </v>
<v Speaker 2>I can hit hard and it got them in </v>

1954
01:22:13.271 --> 01:22:15.610
<v Speaker 2>trouble in that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's a fighter.</v>

1955
01:22:15.690 --> 01:22:16.523
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know what he's talking about with </v>

1956
01:22:17.231 --> 01:22:18.064
<v Speaker 2>athletes that are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are more athletes and less of a </v>

1957
01:22:19.841 --> 01:22:20.674
<v Speaker 2>fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like people say that a lot about george </v>

1958
01:22:21.851 --> 01:22:23.170
<v Speaker 2>st pierre.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1959
01:22:23.200 --> 01:22:24.033
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't know if george st pierre </v>
<v Speaker 2>loves a good nasty like knock down drag </v>

1960
01:22:29.101 --> 01:22:33.220
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know tj dillashaw like loves can't.</v>

1961
01:22:33.400 --> 01:22:35.800
<v Speaker 2>He likes to get punched in the face and </v>
<v Speaker 2>putting fuel back.</v>

1962
01:22:35.801 --> 01:22:38.230
<v Speaker 2>Cody garbrandt will stand there and like</v>
<v Speaker 2>if he gets punished,</v>

1963
01:22:38.530 --> 01:22:41.620
<v Speaker 2>he'll marsh guys down with his face down</v>
<v Speaker 2>and like tell him to hit him again.</v>

1964
01:22:42.130 --> 01:22:44.950
<v Speaker 2>There's those kind of people that love a</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking,</v>

1965
01:22:45.280 --> 01:22:48.760
<v Speaker 2>like a grinding fight whether he's going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do it all the time or not,</v>

1966
01:22:48.761 --> 01:22:49.594
<v Speaker 2>but like they have an affinity for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they enjoy it and then some people </v>

1967
01:22:53.171 --> 01:22:57.310
<v Speaker 2>that are like playing a sport consider </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves tough and don't,</v>

1968
01:22:57.880 --> 01:22:59.140
<v Speaker 2>don't like that kind of.</v>

1969
01:22:59.280 --> 01:23:00.060
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's interesting.</v>

1970
01:23:00.060 --> 01:23:02.440
<v Speaker 5>Rumble said that about himself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Rumble johnson said,</v>

<v Speaker 5>like talking shit to each other and then</v>

2011

<v Speaker 5>going in and it was great because I'm </v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

2012
01:24:21.461 --> 01:24:23.770
<v Speaker 5>this is the guy that I pictured fighting</v>
<v Speaker 5>since I was a teenager,</v>

2013
01:24:24.040 --> 01:24:25.840
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and got prepared for him.</v>

2014
01:24:25.870 --> 01:24:26.770
<v Speaker 5>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2015
01:24:26.890 --> 01:24:28.450
<v Speaker 5>you said once he hit that he stopped.</v>

2016
01:24:28.750 --> 01:24:29.910
<v Speaker 5>So exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Once we're.</v>

2017
01:24:29.940 --> 01:24:32.290
<v Speaker 5>He was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>every time I'd hit him or he,</v>

2018
01:24:32.350 --> 01:24:34.380
<v Speaker 5>I hit him with a good shot or he thought</v>
<v Speaker 5>he'd get me with one good.</v>

2019
01:24:34.390 --> 01:24:37.960
<v Speaker 5>We'd go back and forth until I had </v>
<v Speaker 5>kicked him and my knee hit him.</v>

2020
01:24:37.961 --> 01:24:40.720
<v Speaker 5>And then he came back up and I saw him </v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

2021
01:24:40.880 --> 01:24:42.430
<v Speaker 5>he a great poker face.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Man,</v>

2022
01:24:42.431 --> 01:24:43.720
<v Speaker 5>he's tough.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He knows how to,</v>

2023
01:24:43.721 --> 01:24:44.860
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when he's hurting,</v>

2024
01:24:44.890 --> 01:24:46.840
<v Speaker 5>he keeps it going.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But his eyes,</v>

2025
01:24:46.970 --> 01:24:50.230
<v Speaker 5>he looked at the button like I saw his </v>
<v Speaker 5>pupils go really big and I was,</v>

2026
01:24:50.231 --> 01:24:51.580
<v Speaker 5>hey don,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you having fun yet?</v>

2027
01:24:51.910 --> 01:24:54.630
<v Speaker 5>And he didn't answer back.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was a great thing like that.</v>

2028
01:24:54.660 --> 01:24:57.100
<v Speaker 5>The third round it was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I knew that I was okay,</v>

2029
01:24:57.101 --> 01:24:59.440
<v Speaker 5>if I just keep doing what I'm doing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to win this fight,</v>

2030
01:24:59.500 --> 01:25:01.740
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>end up catching them or you know,</v>

2031
01:25:01.830 --> 01:25:02.663
<v Speaker 5>it's my fight as long as I don't get </v>
<v Speaker 5>caught with something because he throws </v>

2032
01:25:04.450 --> 01:25:07.210
<v Speaker 5>looping punches and kicks and he's very </v>
<v Speaker 5>unorthodox.</v>

2033
01:25:07.810 --> 01:25:09.490
<v Speaker 5>But I knew right then after that he was </v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

2034
01:25:09.520 --> 01:25:10.280

<v Speaker 2>with duane.</v>

2038
01:25:18.660 --> 01:25:22.470
<v Speaker 2>Not so much about the team.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of confusion about what,</v>

2039
01:25:22.590 --> 01:25:23.700
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what went down.</v>

2040
01:25:23.701 --> 01:25:24.534
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fun for people because tj trained </v>

<v Speaker 2>explaining exactly what happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is know you don't have to do that,</v>

2044
01:25:37.321 --> 01:25:41.310
<v Speaker 2>but you tell me from your point of view.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So tj left the team,</v>

2045
01:25:42.200 --> 01:25:43.410
<v Speaker 2>like said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey look,</v>

2046
01:25:44.340 --> 01:25:45.173
<v Speaker 2>I first off it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a timed on ultimate fighter with </v>

2047
01:25:49.351 --> 01:25:51.190
<v Speaker 2>connor with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the company.</v>

2048
01:25:51.280 --> 01:25:54.390
<v Speaker 2>He came from that because he was there </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's when we were defending them.</v>

2049
01:25:54.391 --> 01:25:57.330
<v Speaker 2>That's why I'm kind of like took it to </v>
<v Speaker 2>because he's like,</v>

2050
01:25:57.331 --> 01:25:59.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm all about loyalty and like we don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>do that shit.</v>

2051
01:26:00.150 --> 01:26:03.000
<v Speaker 2>I never really liked dwayne,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially when he left because he was a</v>

2052
01:26:03.680 --> 01:26:04.220
<v Speaker 2>guy</v>

2053
01:26:04.220 --> 01:26:06.680
<v Speaker 3>and like it was always about money and </v>
<v Speaker 3>weird things,</v>

2054
01:26:06.681 --> 01:26:07.430
<v Speaker 3>et cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 3>et cetera.</v>

2055
01:26:07.430 --> 01:26:09.860
<v Speaker 3>He left and that was fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was his deal.</v>

2056
01:26:10.220 --> 01:26:11.053
<v Speaker 3>Tj was going to try to have them come </v>
<v Speaker 3>back in and train at our gym for his </v>

2057
01:26:14.181 --> 01:26:15.014
<v Speaker 3>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And dwayne refused to do it and I'd had </v>

2058
01:26:16.461 --> 01:26:17.390
<v Speaker 3>a talk with teaching.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

2059
01:26:17.870 --> 01:26:19.310
<v Speaker 3>it was crying and like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2060
01:26:19.311 --> 01:26:22.010
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

<v Speaker 4>for a year and three months and he </v>
<v Speaker 4>worked with a bunch of fighters and he </v>

2076
01:26:56.531 --> 01:26:59.460
<v Speaker 4>had a very special relationship with tj,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

2077
01:26:59.540 --> 01:27:00.373
<v Speaker 4>Then he moved out to denver and he moved</v>
<v Speaker 4>out to denver to fight is I want to </v>

<v Speaker 4>They invited tj to come train there.</v>

2080
01:27:09.170 --> 01:27:10.003

<v Speaker 4>that don't know the story that aren't </v>

2081

2082
01:27:13.090 --> 01:27:13.930
<v Speaker 3>So then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so yeah.</v>

2083
01:27:13.931 --> 01:27:16.580
<v Speaker 3>So then he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he basically said that he wanted to,</v>

2084
01:27:17.530 --> 01:27:18.840
<v Speaker 3>that he wanted to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2085
01:27:19.380 --> 01:27:21.640
<v Speaker 3>he was doing his camps there for about a</v>
<v Speaker 3>year and a half,</v>

2086
01:27:21.850 --> 01:27:24.220
<v Speaker 3>but he'd spent a little time there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little time here.</v>

2087
01:27:24.820 --> 01:27:27.630
<v Speaker 3>Most of the time he lived in sacramento </v>
<v Speaker 3>most time there we go.</v>

2088
01:27:27.850 --> 01:27:29.920
<v Speaker 3>Work with dwayne.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No problem with it.</v>

2089
01:27:29.921 --> 01:27:32.710
<v Speaker 3>I cornered with dwayne even after he </v>
<v Speaker 3>left with,</v>

2090
01:27:32.711 --> 01:27:35.290
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with you guys and stuff like that wasn't</v>

2091
01:27:35.291 --> 01:27:36.124
<v Speaker 3>an issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then I heard dwayne actually text me </v>

2092
01:27:39.370 --> 01:27:42.190
<v Speaker 3>and was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dwayne said something like,</v>

2093
01:27:43.110 --> 01:27:43.943
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's a whole side of the </v>

2094
01:27:44.591 --> 01:27:46.240
<v Speaker 3>dwayne thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is hilarious.</v>

2095
01:27:47.170 --> 01:27:51.340
<v Speaker 3>That was him getting weird like a year </v>
<v Speaker 3>after he left,</v>

2096
01:27:51.460 --> 01:27:52.293
<v Speaker 3>like acting like he was there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He tried to sue me for a figment of his </v>

2097
01:27:56.111 --> 01:27:58.750
<v Speaker 3>imagination of some money that wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>even there.</v>

2098
01:27:58.751 --> 01:27:59.584
<v Speaker 3>And like this whole thing he had like </v>
<v Speaker 3>his one of his students write this </v>

2099
01:28:01.541 --> 01:28:01.750
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

2100
01:28:01.750 --> 01:28:04.930
<v Speaker 3>So there is something where he said that</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd like,</v>

2101
01:28:06.280 --> 01:28:09.160
<v Speaker 3>I can't even remember,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like something like I didn't give them a</v>

2102
01:28:09.161 --> 01:28:12.010
<v Speaker 3>discretionary bonus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was supposed to be given or something</v>

2103
01:28:12.011 --> 01:28:12.844
<v Speaker 3>like that and so there was like some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some like intermingling is about that </v>

2104
01:28:18.310 --> 01:28:21.610
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So dwayne texts me and says,</v>

2105
01:28:21.730 --> 01:28:22.391
<v Speaker 3>and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

2106
01:28:22.391 --> 01:28:24.490
<v Speaker 3>I never said I had to set the record </v>
<v Speaker 3>straight on.</v>

2107
01:28:24.491 --> 01:28:26.320
<v Speaker 3>Dwayne and dwayne texts me and says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

2108
01:28:26.770 --> 01:28:29.800
<v Speaker 3>I'm not the one trying to steal your </v>
<v Speaker 3>team in your fighters.</v>

2109
01:28:29.801 --> 01:28:34.750
<v Speaker 3>I know there's a team out here in denver</v>
<v Speaker 3>being built but I'm not a part of that.</v>

2110
01:28:35.320 --> 01:28:36.790
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you talking about?</v>

2111
01:28:36.791 --> 01:28:39.620
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I had talked to him and someone else</v>

2112
01:28:39.800 --> 01:28:40.810

2315
01:36:08.990 --> 01:36:11.180
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this is getting awkward and like you</v>

2316
01:36:11.330 --> 01:36:14.990
<v Speaker 3>being in practice and he no longer being</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the team and everything else.</v>

2317
01:36:15.410 --> 01:36:16.243
<v Speaker 3>Like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's finish out this this last couple </v>

2318
01:36:17.991 --> 01:36:20.180
<v Speaker 3>of days and then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2319
01:36:20.660 --> 01:36:21.650
<v Speaker 3>you'd be on your team.</v>

2320
01:36:21.710 --> 01:36:23.600
<v Speaker 3>We can be friends on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the outside,</v>

2321
01:36:23.601 --> 01:36:25.220
<v Speaker 3>we can work on that as a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a deal,</v>

2322
01:36:25.221 --> 01:36:27.110
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's like you.</v>

2323
01:36:27.350 --> 01:36:29.300
<v Speaker 3>He wanted to come in and train with our </v>
<v Speaker 3>team's still,</v>

2324
01:36:29.301 --> 01:36:31.850
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as not as not part of the team.</v>

2325
01:36:31.960 --> 01:36:35.000
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I was like,</v>

2326
01:36:35.001 --> 01:36:37.970
<v Speaker 3>but you're welcome to stay on our team </v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously if you want and continue to do</v>

2327
01:36:37.971 --> 01:36:41.420
<v Speaker 3>your camps and whatnot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he is just like,</v>

2328
01:36:42.470 --> 01:36:43.303
<v Speaker 3>like out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So at that point it became him taking </v>

2329
01:36:46.881 --> 01:36:48.130
<v Speaker 3>this opportunity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to denver,</v>

2330
01:36:48.140 --> 01:36:48.973
<v Speaker 3>being with dwayne,</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting paid to do the muscle farm </v>

2331
01:36:50.331 --> 01:36:51.164
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the whole thing with connor </v>

2332
01:36:53.271 --> 01:36:57.590
<v Speaker 3>happened on the tv show before this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>before any of this happened,</v>

2333
01:36:57.830 --> 01:37:00.570
<v Speaker 3>conor mcgregor started calling him in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>coma.</v>

2334
01:37:00.590 --> 01:37:04.730
<v Speaker 3>Snake a snake because me and connor had </v>
<v Speaker 3>one conversation.</v>

<v Speaker 3>We were sitting there and he goes,</v>

2337

<v Speaker 3>but what's up with dwayne saying that no</v>

2340
01:37:15.441 --> 01:37:17.480
<v Speaker 3>one on your team wants to be champions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's weird.</v>

2341
01:37:17.481 --> 01:37:17.901
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2342
01:37:17.901 --> 01:37:21.230
<v Speaker 3>he's just bitter because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's trying to get everyone to go out to</v>

2343
01:37:21.231 --> 01:37:24.170
<v Speaker 3>his camp and he's just being a hater and</v>
<v Speaker 3>this and that.</v>

2344
01:37:24.710 --> 01:37:27.000
<v Speaker 3>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he took that little bit of,</v>

2345
01:37:27.080 --> 01:37:29.780
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of drama between me and dwayne,</v>

2346
01:37:29.781 --> 01:37:32.090
<v Speaker 3>like dwayne saying that no one on our </v>
<v Speaker 3>team wanted to be your champions,</v>

2347
01:37:32.091 --> 01:37:34.610
<v Speaker 3>including cody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who sent him a text,</v>

2348
01:37:34.670 --> 01:37:36.080
<v Speaker 3>a tweet that said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

2349
01:37:36.260 --> 01:37:37.093

<v Speaker 3>you're like a jealous girlfriend or </v>

2350
01:37:38.541 --> 01:37:39.374
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he said he took that one little </v>

2351
01:37:40.821 --> 01:37:43.190
<v Speaker 3>thing and then next time you saw tj he </v>
<v Speaker 3>goes,</v>

2352
01:37:43.191 --> 01:37:44.960
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2353
01:37:44.961 --> 01:37:45.794
<v Speaker 3>And just built it in this big thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that means either how well he is so </v>

2354
01:37:49.521 --> 01:37:51.120
<v Speaker 3>good at seeing people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2355
01:37:51.470 --> 01:37:56.190
<v Speaker 3>So that took like what really happened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is tj got to go somewhere else.</v>

2356
01:37:56.550 --> 01:37:57.240
<v Speaker 3>Me saying,</v>

2358
01:37:58.091 --> 01:37:59.190

<v Speaker 3>But like,</v>

2359
01:37:59.191 --> 01:38:00.330
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're on that team,</v>

2360
01:38:00.331 --> 01:38:01.164
<v Speaker 3>you're on that team.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then then connor turned the public </v>

2361
01:38:04.681 --> 01:38:09.420
<v Speaker 3>around on him because it came out later </v>
<v Speaker 3>after the thing.</v>

2362
01:38:09.630 --> 01:38:12.300
<v Speaker 3>And so then tiji became the victim and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then he.</v>

2363
01:38:12.350 --> 01:38:14.950

<v Speaker 3>ludwig and I kicked him off the team.</v>

<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

2516
01:44:00.700 --> 01:44:02.120
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he was like,</v>

2517
01:44:02.130 --> 01:44:04.020
<v Speaker 5>I'm not going to hit him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're fighting in two weeks out.</v>

2518
01:44:04.021 --> 01:44:04.854
<v Speaker 5>It wasn't like that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but literally he had to say he fell </v>

2519
01:44:06.291 --> 01:44:07.400
<v Speaker 5>forward and he slipped.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

2520

<v Speaker 5>do it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I'm not going to stay anyone know?</v>

2521
01:44:09.650 --> 01:44:10.483
<v Speaker 5>And then I was showing danny how I like </v>
<v Speaker 5>steal because he likes overran rates </v>

<v Speaker 5>I barely remember this.</v>

2551
01:45:12.351 --> 01:45:14.090
<v Speaker 5>I think it was happening.</v>
<v Speaker 5>First off,</v>

2552
01:45:14.450 --> 01:45:17.120
<v Speaker 5>here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cody is a dangerous,</v>

2553
01:45:17.150 --> 01:45:19.580
<v Speaker 5>dangerous motherfucker if you're not on </v>
<v Speaker 5>your,</v>

2554
01:45:19.640 --> 01:45:20.473
<v Speaker 5>even if he's not trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you get in fucking rocked or hurt or </v>

2555
01:45:23.451 --> 01:45:25.700
<v Speaker 5>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I have to be on,</v>

2556
01:45:25.780 --> 01:45:28.010
<v Speaker 5>on a game with him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Even if you go on light,</v>

2557
01:45:28.011 --> 01:45:29.360
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>unless he's going to go light,</v>

2558
01:45:29.570 --> 01:45:32.420
<v Speaker 5>but light doesn't work when the guys </v>
<v Speaker 5>accurate and strong and everything else.</v>

2559
01:45:32.421 --> 01:45:34.520
<v Speaker 5>So we had to go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it was just like a,</v>

2560
01:45:34.640 --> 01:45:35.473
<v Speaker 5>like a wizard hip heist.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Lots me do that last year on my head </v>

2561
01:45:39.280 --> 01:45:41.490
<v Speaker 5>because you were coming after me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was like,</v>

2562
01:45:42.230 --> 01:45:44.900
<v Speaker 5>so I know now when there's a camera crew</v>
<v Speaker 5>fall in favor.</v>

2563
01:45:44.901 --> 01:45:46.700
<v Speaker 5>It's not light.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's fucking to fight.</v>

2564
01:45:46.990 --> 01:45:47.823
<v Speaker 5>So I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's where that came from about the </v>

2565
01:45:51.531 --> 01:45:53.530
<v Speaker 5>video and like coming out like we have </v>
<v Speaker 5>the video,</v>

2566
01:45:53.560 --> 01:45:54.770
<v Speaker 5>you can get knocked out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>tj.</v>

2567
01:45:55.040 --> 01:45:55.873
<v Speaker 5>You didn't make it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was saying he made us beat us all up </v>

2568
01:45:57.111 --> 01:45:57.944
<v Speaker 5>like with the dominic sit down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dwayne was maybe saying that or </v>

2569
01:46:00.921 --> 01:46:01.780
<v Speaker 5>something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He said,</v>

2570
01:46:01.840 --> 01:46:03.620
<v Speaker 5>oh god,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you beat your teammates.</v>

2571
01:46:03.621 --> 01:46:04.101
<v Speaker 5>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

2572
01:46:04.101 --> 01:46:05.840
<v Speaker 5>I actually for a matter of fact haven't </v>
<v Speaker 5>beaten them up.</v>

2573
01:46:06.400 --> 01:46:08.450
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't fall most of this stuff.</v>

2574
01:46:08.570 --> 01:46:10.430
<v Speaker 5>What are your.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's your thoughts on sparring?</v>

2575
01:46:10.460 --> 01:46:13.130
<v Speaker 5>Like do you think that you should be </v>
<v Speaker 5>sparring hard or do you think you should</v>

2576
01:46:13.160 --> 01:46:13.993
<v Speaker 5>be sparring technical and pull back on </v>
<v Speaker 5>shots or do you think you should have a </v>

2577
01:46:17.151 --> 01:46:19.070
<v Speaker 5>little bit of both?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think a little bit of both.</v>

2578
01:46:19.071 --> 01:46:21.880
<v Speaker 5>I think beginning of camp you get your,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your,</v>

2579
01:46:22.070 --> 01:46:22.903
<v Speaker 5>your,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your rounds into where you're feeling </v>

2580
01:46:25.211 --> 01:46:27.980
<v Speaker 5>comfortable and then later on I can't be</v>
<v Speaker 5>your technique,</v>

2581
01:46:28.310 --> 01:46:29.041
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your,</v>

2582
01:46:29.041 --> 01:46:31.280
<v Speaker 5>your combos that you're working kind of </v>
<v Speaker 5>like flight simulation,</v>

2583
01:46:31.281 --> 01:46:32.114
<v Speaker 5>but get those rounds in because you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>not wanting to beat your body up closer </v>

2584
01:46:33.831 --> 01:46:36.030
<v Speaker 5>to the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want to feel fresh at the fight and I,</v>

2585
01:46:36.031 --> 01:46:39.410
<v Speaker 5>that's how I've always used.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I literally get 50 rounds of sparring,</v>

2586
01:46:39.680 --> 01:46:40.513
<v Speaker 5>start tapering off towards the end of </v>
<v Speaker 5>the end of the fight camp as it called </v>

2587
01:46:43.680 --> 01:46:45.590
<v Speaker 5>unboxing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Really camp.</v>

2588
01:46:46.220 --> 01:46:48.320
<v Speaker 5>Do try to spar with only people that you</v>
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>

2589
01:46:48.321 --> 01:46:49.770
<v Speaker 5>so you didn't know that you can trust </v>
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>

2590
01:46:49.771 --> 01:46:50.010
<v Speaker 5>So you</v>

2591
01:46:50.010 --> 01:46:50.843
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like especially obviously there's tj </v>

2592
01:46:52.061 --> 01:46:53.220
<v Speaker 4>fights,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a giant fight,</v>

2593
01:46:53.250 --> 01:46:54.083
<v Speaker 4>huge fight and it's going to be huge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not just for the division but for the </v>

2594
01:46:56.581 --> 01:46:57.414
<v Speaker 4>sport.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean all the major fans are going to </v>

2595
01:46:58.891 --> 01:47:00.030
<v Speaker 4>be paying attention to this fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2596
01:47:00.280 --> 01:47:02.410
<v Speaker 5>definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm safe with it now.</v>

2597
01:47:02.411 --> 01:47:05.920
<v Speaker 5>Like we were talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have all these fights log in.</v>

2598
01:47:05.950 --> 01:47:09.100
<v Speaker 5>Not even just all the street fights,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all the boxing matches,</v>

2599
01:47:09.250 --> 01:47:13.000
<v Speaker 5>the sparring work.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't need to spar as much,</v>

2600
01:47:13.090 --> 01:47:16.750
<v Speaker 5>but I need to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We were respiring 10 rounds for the cruz</v>

2601
01:47:16.751 --> 01:47:18.130
<v Speaker 5>fight,</v>
<v Speaker 5>10 straight fives,</v>

2602
01:47:18.330 --> 01:47:19.660
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>eight to 10 each week.</v>

2603
01:47:19.670 --> 01:47:22.190
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>buckles is kinda,</v>

2604
01:47:22.800 --> 01:47:23.890
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it worked,</v>

2605
01:47:23.980 --> 01:47:25.870
<v Speaker 5>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>But we were doing smaller glove,</v>

2606
01:47:25.930 --> 01:47:28.370
<v Speaker 5>more mma based,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2607
01:47:28.540 --> 01:47:29.373
<v Speaker 5>big gloves.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean me techniques thrown out the </v>

2608
01:47:30.221 --> 01:47:30.910
<v Speaker 5>window,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2609
01:47:30.910 --> 01:47:32.620
<v Speaker 5>people just sprawl and brawl kind of </v>
<v Speaker 5>shit.</v>

2610
01:47:32.621 --> 01:47:34.150
<v Speaker 5>Like I liked small glove,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2611
01:47:34.151 --> 01:47:35.830
<v Speaker 5>you're still pepper in the shots hitting</v>
<v Speaker 5>them,</v>

2612
01:47:36.100 --> 01:47:38.050
<v Speaker 5>but you're working the whole gang </v>
<v Speaker 5>takedowns submissions.</v>

2613
01:47:38.070 --> 01:47:39.380
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I liked that.</v>

2614
01:47:39.381 --> 01:47:40.214
<v Speaker 5>And also fight simulations.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I like fight like having my uncle come </v>

2615
01:47:42.941 --> 01:47:43.840
<v Speaker 5>out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>pad holder,</v>

<v Speaker 5>different buyers rely on you as like a </v>

2618
01:47:50.410 --> 01:47:51.940
<v Speaker 5>fight there on next.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2619
01:47:51.941 --> 01:47:53.830
<v Speaker 5>you're hitting pads and you get tackled </v>
<v Speaker 5>from behind.</v>

2620
01:47:53.831 --> 01:47:54.650
<v Speaker 5>You have to work up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2621
01:47:54.650 --> 01:47:55.960
<v Speaker 5>things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's safe,</v>

2622
01:47:55.970 --> 01:47:58.540
<v Speaker 5>you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's typically what I like to do.</v>

2623
01:47:58.730 --> 01:47:59.450
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is,</v>

2624
01:47:59.450 --> 01:48:01.070
<v Speaker 3>there is nothing like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2625
01:48:01.071 --> 01:48:02.420
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like we talked about running,</v>

2626
01:48:02.421 --> 01:48:03.770
<v Speaker 3>sprinting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blowing out the lungs,</v>

2627
01:48:03.771 --> 01:48:06.980
<v Speaker 3>etc.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing like actual,</v>

2628
01:48:07.010 --> 01:48:11.280
<v Speaker 3>like intense sparring to simulate what </v>
<v Speaker 3>it feels like in a fight though and it's</v>

2629
01:48:11.590 --> 01:48:15.800
<v Speaker 3>familiar as you get with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It still feels horrible when it happens.</v>

2630
01:48:16.340 --> 01:48:17.173
<v Speaker 3>Like I've been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've always been known as the </v>

2631
01:48:18.530 --> 01:48:19.363
<v Speaker 3>conditioning guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I can condition and and like never </v>

2632
01:48:22.341 --> 01:48:23.420
<v Speaker 3>get tired,</v>
<v Speaker 3>etc.</v>

2633
01:48:23.470 --> 01:48:24.530
<v Speaker 3>Etc.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In fights,</v>

2634
01:48:24.980 --> 01:48:27.110
<v Speaker 3>you get tired.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's about the poker face,</v>

2635
01:48:27.111 --> 01:48:27.944
<v Speaker 3>it's about being familiar with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's about like you know these things </v>

2636
01:48:31.680 --> 01:48:32.270
<v Speaker 3>be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2637
01:48:32.270 --> 01:48:33.860
<v Speaker 3>being comfortable with that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>being comfortable with it.</v>

2638
01:48:33.861 --> 01:48:37.720
<v Speaker 3>So you have to get there sometimes and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just being smart about it.</v>

2639
01:48:37.980 --> 01:48:40.310
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cowboy doesn't spar anymore really?</v>

2640
01:48:40.420 --> 01:48:41.253
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cowboys essentially does mostly drills </v>

2641
01:48:43.021 --> 01:48:46.570
<v Speaker 4>and pad work and simulations and stuff </v>
<v Speaker 4>like that and if he does sparkling,</v>

2642
01:48:46.580 --> 01:48:49.980
<v Speaker 4>these bars super light because he was </v>
<v Speaker 4>realizing that he was beating himself up</v>

2643
01:48:49.981 --> 01:48:50.814
<v Speaker 4>too much and training and coming into </v>
<v Speaker 4>fights like already kind of a little </v>

2644

01:48:55.740 --> 01:48:57.920
<v Speaker 5>hurt them for a week and that's what he </v>
<v Speaker 5>loved to do.</v>

2646
01:48:58.880 --> 01:49:02.150
<v Speaker 5>Fucking treadmill,</v>
<v Speaker 5>bike workouts and sparring pad work.</v>

2647
01:49:02.630 --> 01:49:04.310
<v Speaker 5>Nothing really else interested with </v>
<v Speaker 5>jesse.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Just love sparring,</v>

<v Speaker 3>he's like a killer knocking dudes </v>

2653
01:49:14.091 --> 01:49:16.100
<v Speaker 3>allegation like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a,</v>

2655
01:49:17.940 --> 01:49:20.690
<v Speaker 5>luck in sparring.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sparring partner probably.</v>

2656
01:49:20.770 --> 01:49:22.840
<v Speaker 5>Maybe that's one of the reasons why I </v>
<v Speaker 5>stopped doing it.</v>

2657
01:49:22.880 --> 01:49:25.660
<v Speaker 5>Probably maybe all that stuff just.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2658
01:49:25.661 --> 01:49:28.390
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

<v Speaker 5>bit,</v>

2669
01:49:48.281 --> 01:49:52.240
<v Speaker 5>like just knowing that it's a couple </v>

<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2671
01:49:53.821 --> 01:49:55.690
<v Speaker 5>that's why it feels good,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you feel good about it.</v>

2672
01:49:55.691 --> 01:49:57.640
<v Speaker 5>Like your mom,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like we're going to go in here and fight</v>

<v Speaker 5>It's going to be.</v>

2674
01:50:00.161 --> 01:50:01.330
<v Speaker 5>I hope it's a phone booth,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2675
01:50:01.500 --> 01:50:02.270
<v Speaker 5>I hope it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2676
01:50:02.270 --> 01:50:03.130
<v Speaker 5>standard trade.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's,</v>

2677
01:50:03.400 --> 01:50:05.350
<v Speaker 5>let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know how he's gonna you know,</v>

2678
01:50:05.480 --> 01:50:07.450
<v Speaker 5>because he knows my skills and knows </v>
<v Speaker 5>that I have,</v>

2679
01:50:07.830 --> 01:50:08.663
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>lilly have gotten so much better since </v>

2680
01:50:10.481 --> 01:50:11.314
<v Speaker 5>then.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was still getting the better of him </v>

2681
01:50:13.130 --> 01:50:15.220
<v Speaker 5>and I'm not saying this to toot my own </v>
<v Speaker 5>horn or whatever.</v>

2682
01:50:15.221 --> 01:50:16.054
<v Speaker 5>It's the gym.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But you're as competitive as he isn't </v>

2683
01:50:18.250 --> 01:50:19.083
<v Speaker 5>competitive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I am.</v>

2684
01:50:19.160 --> 01:50:20.740
<v Speaker 5>You're not going to give an edge in </v>
<v Speaker 5>practice.</v>

2685
01:50:20.741 --> 01:50:21.820
<v Speaker 5>I don't give them an edge of practice.</v>

2686
01:50:21.820 --> 01:50:23.800
<v Speaker 5>Favorite takes me down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're going again.</v>

2687
01:50:23.801 --> 01:50:24.571
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was vice versa.</v>

2688
01:50:24.571 --> 01:50:27.820
<v Speaker 5>I'd take favorite down like oh it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>overtime we go 40 minutes after.</v>

2689
01:50:27.830 --> 01:50:28.663
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes it's like this guy's one of </v>
<v Speaker 5>the hardest guys a break because he's </v>

2690
01:50:30.881 --> 01:50:34.930
<v Speaker 5>just obviously too dumb to know he tired</v>
<v Speaker 5>or stopped going.</v>

2691
01:50:35.040 --> 01:50:39.130
<v Speaker 5>Like someone like we were just talking </v>
<v Speaker 5>about that and now he's retired.</v>

2692
01:50:39.131 --> 01:50:42.160
<v Speaker 5>So he comes in like these guys are like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fresh off is all fresh,</v>

2693
01:50:42.161 --> 01:50:42.994
<v Speaker 5>but it comes in like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this guy's retired like fuck favorite </v>

2694
01:50:45.140 --> 01:50:46.960
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this guy is breaking these younger dudes</v>

2695
01:50:46.961 --> 01:50:49.870
<v Speaker 5>that are killers themselves because he </v>
<v Speaker 5>just has that mentality.</v>

2696
01:50:49.871 --> 01:50:52.690
<v Speaker 5>It's a different breed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's what I'm like.</v>

2697
01:50:52.691 --> 01:50:54.640
<v Speaker 5>I said tj,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's that breed.</v>

2698
01:50:55.110 --> 01:50:57.160
<v Speaker 5>He is at that point,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2699
01:50:57.161 --> 01:51:01.780
<v Speaker 5>he's an alpha male guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And fortunately for me,</v>

2700
01:51:01.781 --> 01:51:02.614
<v Speaker 5>I feel like you could ever reckoned in </v>
<v Speaker 5>style or do you feel like he's crossed </v>

2701
01:51:05.711 --> 01:51:08.500
<v Speaker 5>the line into some weird sort of area?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2702
01:51:08.630 --> 01:51:10.780
<v Speaker 3>Did so much defending of that guy </v>
<v Speaker 3>because of,</v>

2703
01:51:11.540 --> 01:51:12.373
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever his thing is here and this and </v>

2704
01:51:13.911 --> 01:51:14.744
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I have a lot of great friends that </v>

2705
01:51:16.971 --> 01:51:20.060
<v Speaker 3>are newer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean like cody's newer in my life,</v>

2706
01:51:20.061 --> 01:51:20.894
<v Speaker 3>but we've got a bond.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got friends that I've had since I </v>

2707
01:51:23.841 --> 01:51:27.950
<v Speaker 3>was like kindergarten and before </v>
<v Speaker 3>kindergarten and drawing up together,</v>

2708
01:51:27.951 --> 01:51:28.784
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in my community in like I've got great </v>

2709
01:51:31.221 --> 01:51:33.590
<v Speaker 3>groups of friends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's like,</v>

2710
01:51:34.100 --> 01:51:34.933
<v Speaker 3>I mean I can reconcile whatever just </v>
<v Speaker 3>stopped lying about what actually </v>

2711
01:51:37.731 --> 01:51:38.564
<v Speaker 3>happened to save your face is like I'd </v>
<v Speaker 3>never kicked the guy off of a team or </v>

2712
01:51:42.501 --> 01:51:43.334
<v Speaker 3>anything and then he gets a one </v>
<v Speaker 3>opportunity on national television to </v>

2713
01:51:46.281 --> 01:51:48.590
<v Speaker 3>say something about me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's my only qualm with the guy.</v>

2714
01:51:48.950 --> 01:51:51.410
<v Speaker 3>I didn't like dwayne because of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>things that he had done.</v>

2715
01:51:51.830 --> 01:51:53.230
<v Speaker 3>But tj and I will always work</v>

2716
01:51:53.560 --> 01:51:54.393
<v Speaker 5>because work is that people making the </v>
<v Speaker 5>weirdest things about running a jam and </v>

2717
01:51:58.081 --> 01:52:00.570
<v Speaker 5>running a camp is a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you kind of have to manage,</v>

2718
01:52:00.590 --> 01:52:03.830
<v Speaker 5>you have to be like a psychologist.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Personality did.</v>

2719
01:52:04.090 --> 01:52:08.280
<v Speaker 5>A lot of fighters are prima donnas and </v>
<v Speaker 5>you do not just a trainer,</v>

2720
01:52:08.310 --> 01:52:09.143
<v Speaker 5>not just a teammate but you also a </v>
<v Speaker 5>psychologist and some sort of a </v>

2721
01:52:12.861 --> 01:52:13.694
<v Speaker 5>counseling</v>

2722
01:52:13.960 --> 01:52:15.460
<v Speaker 3>be glue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which and when I,</v>

2723
01:52:15.470 --> 01:52:16.303
<v Speaker 3>I honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just learning this more and more </v>

2724
01:52:18.020 --> 01:52:21.380
<v Speaker 3>when I stepped out of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the area too much.</v>

2725
01:52:21.590 --> 01:52:22.423
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I have to come back in and put </v>

2726
01:52:24.501 --> 01:52:26.360
<v Speaker 3>out fires and bring everyone back </v>
<v Speaker 3>together.</v>

2727
01:52:26.361 --> 01:52:28.730
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say that's one of my skills is,</v>

2728
01:52:29.030 --> 01:52:33.260
<v Speaker 3>is getting along with people and making </v>
<v Speaker 3>things mesh and in finding a culture and</v>

2729
01:52:33.261 --> 01:52:38.060
<v Speaker 3>building like a healthy environment and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that can get tweaked so easily.</v>

2730
01:52:38.061 --> 01:52:39.770
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's cancer.</v>

2750
01:53:23.470 --> 01:53:24.303
<v Speaker 3>it's a big co op and different people </v>

01:53:34.060 --> 01:53:35.660
<v Speaker 5>Is he completely done competing?</v>

2756
01:53:36.320 --> 01:53:39.020
<v Speaker 3>That's a great question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You never know with,</v>

2757
01:53:39.050 --> 01:53:40.400
<v Speaker 3>with the fight game,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

2758
01:53:40.790 --> 01:53:43.340
<v Speaker 3>It only takes a yes to be back in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fight game.</v>

2759
01:53:43.341 --> 01:53:43.720
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

2760
01:53:43.720 --> 01:53:46.840
<v Speaker 5>sometimes guys when they coach they also</v>
<v Speaker 5>feel like they're getting better because</v>

2761
01:53:46.841 --> 01:53:47.674
<v Speaker 5>they understand things more.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You see that a lot with jujitsu </v>

2762
01:53:50.441 --> 01:53:53.290
<v Speaker 5>competitors or at times coaching makes </v>
<v Speaker 5>them a better fighter.</v>

2800
01:55:21.550 --> 01:55:22.383
<v Speaker 5>Kicking and wild shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like when he hit bj penn with a </v>

<v Speaker 5>That's a good range.</v>

2805
01:55:32.990 --> 01:55:34.260
<v Speaker 5>Even said that he's hands,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2806
01:55:34.261 --> 01:55:37.540
<v Speaker 5>I'm not so good with the range and like </v>
<v Speaker 5>knowing like my kicks,</v>

2807
01:55:37.541 --> 01:55:39.940
<v Speaker 5>I'm real accurate with his kicks and he </v>
<v Speaker 5>says I kick harder and stuff.</v>

2808
01:55:40.310 --> 01:55:44.030
<v Speaker 5>I think that he feels like he's more </v>
<v Speaker 5>accurate with this ass kicks</v>

2809
01:55:44.040 --> 01:55:45.300
<v Speaker 3>and he is with his hands</v>

2810
01:55:46.390 --> 01:55:49.660
<v Speaker 4>quinces if he's not doing it with </v>
<v Speaker 4>someone who's also a great kicker,</v>

2811
01:55:49.680 --> 01:55:50.513
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because he's able to operate in a range </v>

2812
01:55:51.551 --> 01:55:53.920
<v Speaker 4>where he's pretty effective and most </v>
<v Speaker 4>people aren't.</v>

2813
01:55:54.010 --> 01:55:55.840
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he's a long kIcker too.</v>

2818
01:56:05.140 --> 01:56:07.060

<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>

2819
01:56:07.460 --> 01:56:11.920
<v Speaker 3>I got to hear a little bit about like </v>
<v Speaker 3>the townies from chihuahua in Mexico and</v>

2820
01:56:11.921 --> 01:56:12.754
<v Speaker 3>like it's a pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty scary place and in kind of his </v>

2821
01:56:15.431 --> 01:56:16.264
<v Speaker 3>journey as a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a young kid is one of the top karate </v>

2822
01:56:18.341 --> 01:56:19.174
<v Speaker 3>guys in Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so he's been a competItor for a long </v>

2823
01:56:22.421 --> 01:56:23.254
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Used to have a coach that used to like </v>

2824
01:56:24.370 --> 01:56:25.203
<v Speaker 3>hit him with a stick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they left that place and the guy </v>

2825
01:56:26.651 --> 01:56:29.740
<v Speaker 3>called him back and was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can you please come back and I won't hit</v>

2826
01:56:29.750 --> 01:56:30.780
<v Speaker 3>you with it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2827
01:56:30.790 --> 01:56:32.350
<v Speaker 3>What he was like seven and eight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2828
01:56:32.500 --> 01:56:33.910
<v Speaker 3>jesus christ,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's been,</v>

2829
01:56:33.911 --> 01:56:36.280
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's been in a combat sport</v>

2830
01:56:36.300 --> 01:56:36.960
<v Speaker 4>for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2831
01:56:36.960 --> 01:56:40.440
<v Speaker 4>I think that frankie edgar fight was a </v>
<v Speaker 4>very tough fight for him,</v>

2832
01:56:40.470 --> 01:56:41.303
<v Speaker 4>but a good fight as far as a learning </v>
<v Speaker 4>experience and a lot of people had said </v>

2833
01:56:44.971 --> 01:56:46.560
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I was one of the ones that said it,</v>

2834
01:56:46.561 --> 01:56:49.080
<v Speaker 4>like we'll see what happens when he </v>
<v Speaker 4>fights a great wrestler.</v>

2835
01:56:49.270 --> 01:56:50.103
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's going to be the real issue with </v>

2836
01:56:50.521 --> 01:56:52.890
<v Speaker 4>him because he's got all this wild </v>
<v Speaker 4>kicking stuff,</v>

2837
01:56:53.340 --> 01:56:55.890
<v Speaker 4>but that stuff doesn't work if somebody </v>
<v Speaker 4>grabs a hold of you.</v>

2838
01:56:56.070 --> 01:56:57.240
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if somebody.</v>

2839
01:56:57.310 --> 01:56:58.780
<v Speaker 4>Frank frank.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2840
01:56:58.910 --> 01:56:59.360
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2841
01:56:59.360 --> 01:57:03.530
<v Speaker 3>Frank at a different level of guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a great mixing it together.</v>

2842
01:57:03.590 --> 01:57:04.423
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a year hIs wrestling because I got to </v>

2843
01:57:07.011 --> 01:57:07.844

2844
01:57:08.961 --> 01:57:11.690
<v Speaker 3>wrestling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but his wrestling is good.</v>

2845
01:57:11.750 --> 01:57:15.650
<v Speaker 3>It's just like connor connor's wrestling</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2848
01:57:20.511 --> 01:57:21.890
<v Speaker 3>so like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2849
01:57:21.910 --> 01:57:24.680
<v Speaker 3>years made a lot of gains he wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>share with izzy,</v>

2850
01:57:24.770 --> 01:57:27.140
<v Speaker 3>izzy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Israel martinez who put him through like</v>

2851
01:57:27.141 --> 01:57:27.860

<v Speaker 3>like a whole year of wrestling.</v>

2855
01:57:34.281 --> 01:57:36.680

<v Speaker 3>but it's not,</v>

2856
01:57:38.030 --> 01:57:40.360
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it needs to get to another break,</v>

2857
01:57:40.520 --> 01:57:41.353
<v Speaker 3>jaeger level when you're a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 3>fatigued and you make a small mistake </v>

2858
01:57:44.811 --> 01:57:46.790
<v Speaker 3>and the guy can capitalize,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's getting there.</v>

2862
01:57:52.251 --> 01:57:53.084
<v Speaker 4>his approach is very unique and it's one</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the things that's exciting about him </v>

2863
01:57:55.580 --> 01:57:58.160
<v Speaker 4>is that he's got that crazy wild kicking</v>

<v Speaker 2>timeouts that man.</v>

2921

<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh fuck that motherfucker no time now </v>

2922
02:00:20.330 --> 02:00:21.380
<v Speaker 2>because it's a grinder</v>

2923
02:00:22.820 --> 02:00:24.740
<v Speaker 4>great against dennis bermudez.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a big win,</v>

2924
02:00:24.850 --> 02:00:27.620
<v Speaker 4>a big win and he looks smooth and that's</v>
<v Speaker 4>fine.</v>

2925
02:00:27.770 --> 02:00:30.650
<v Speaker 4>He didn't take as much damage,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the names of damage for a reason because</v>

2926
02:00:30.651 --> 02:00:32.870
<v Speaker 4>he gets somebody to also like the way </v>
<v Speaker 4>his.</v>

2927
02:00:32.930 --> 02:00:36.980
<v Speaker 4>He's moving looks better ways.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Kicking and punching his combinations.</v>

2928
02:00:37.220 --> 02:00:38.053
<v Speaker 4>He looks like he's got less extra steps.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like this all smoothness and his </v>

2929
02:00:42.240 --> 02:00:43.580
<v Speaker 4>transitions in his movement.</v>

2930
02:00:43.700 --> 02:00:44.533
<v Speaker 2>That's what I've been working on in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go ahead and I think a lot of that has </v>

2931
02:00:46.580 --> 02:00:48.490
<v Speaker 2>to do with obviously working the </v>
<v Speaker 2>footwork,</v>

2932
02:00:48.500 --> 02:00:49.333
<v Speaker 2>like these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of these guys that are straight </v>

2933
02:00:49.761 --> 02:00:51.100
<v Speaker 2>wrestlers and then like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

2934
02:00:51.101 --> 02:00:53.690
<v Speaker 2>we're going to wrestle and throw punches</v>
<v Speaker 2>and try to take you down.</v>

2935
02:00:53.691 --> 02:00:57.140
<v Speaker 2>But your footwork is the core of </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

2936
02:00:57.141 --> 02:00:58.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can have throw good hands,</v>

2937
02:00:58.581 --> 02:01:00.530
<v Speaker 2>but if your feet are out of position or </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting taken down,</v>

2938
02:01:00.890 --> 02:01:03.140
<v Speaker 2>you know you're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not gonna land power punches.</v>

2939
02:01:03.290 --> 02:01:04.410
<v Speaker 2>So the footwork,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2940
02:01:04.490 --> 02:01:09.220
<v Speaker 2>I religiously work on footwork daily.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like this will work.</v>

2941
02:01:09.290 --> 02:01:10.350
<v Speaker 2>That's dominant.</v>

2942
02:01:10.410 --> 02:01:14.010
<v Speaker 4>I mean that is his entire thing is his </v>
<v Speaker 4>ability to move.</v>

2943
02:01:14.011 --> 02:01:16.320
<v Speaker 4>It's just so unusual as footwork.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we're.</v>

2944
02:01:16.900 --> 02:01:17.733
<v Speaker 4>That's one of the things where you went </v>
<v Speaker 4>toe for toe for toe to toe with them </v>

2945
02:01:21.120 --> 02:01:23.610
<v Speaker 4>when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your footwork was equally as good as his</v>

2946
02:01:23.611 --> 02:01:25.710
<v Speaker 4>is not better and you were landing </v>
<v Speaker 4>harder.</v>

2947
02:01:25.711 --> 02:01:26.500
<v Speaker 4>Combination</v>

2948
02:01:26.500 --> 02:01:27.333
<v Speaker 2>for us to master tang was all about </v>
<v Speaker 2>footwork and biomechanics and he's back </v>

2949
02:01:31.871 --> 02:01:32.704
<v Speaker 2>in Thailand now and then that's been </v>
<v Speaker 2>passed on to our next generation of </v>

2950
02:01:34.751 --> 02:01:36.130
<v Speaker 2>coaches from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He moved back.</v>

2951
02:01:36.460 --> 02:01:39.740
<v Speaker 2>He did move back after 11 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why did he decide to back to silent?</v>

2952
02:01:39.800 --> 02:01:40.040
<v Speaker 2>Became</v>

2953
02:01:40.040 --> 02:01:43.430
<v Speaker 3>a monk for a day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It came up for a day because because his</v>

2954
02:01:43.460 --> 02:01:44.293
<v Speaker 3>parents had died,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you don't go and live in the </v>

2955
02:01:46.371 --> 02:01:51.371
<v Speaker 3>monastery for within a year and a half </v>
<v Speaker 3>after he hadn't seen his son in 11 years</v>

2956
02:01:52.171 --> 02:01:54.650
<v Speaker 3>since sentras for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he,</v>

2957
02:01:54.710 --> 02:01:55.543
<v Speaker 3>I mean he spent all his time facetiming </v>
<v Speaker 3>with his family and he wasn't </v>

2958
02:01:57.591 --> 02:02:01.160
<v Speaker 3>necessarily allowed back in the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He went and he went back,</v>

2959
02:02:01.161 --> 02:02:02.030
<v Speaker 3>he stuck back.</v>

2960
02:02:02.050 --> 02:02:04.080
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't allowed pack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How come?</v>

2961
02:02:04.570 --> 02:02:06.660
<v Speaker 2>Illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2962
02:02:06.960 --> 02:02:07.793
<v Speaker 2>oh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he couldn't come back to America if </v>

2963
02:02:09.071 --> 02:02:10.240
<v Speaker 2>you went back to Thailand?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2964
02:02:10.370 --> 02:02:11.630
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>so when he was gone,</v>

2965
02:02:11.631 --> 02:02:13.130
<v Speaker 3>he was gone because he overstayed a </v>
<v Speaker 3>visa.</v>

2966
02:02:14.660 --> 02:02:15.650
<v Speaker 3>So he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2967
02:02:16.070 --> 02:02:17.420
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's one universal.</v>

2968
02:02:17.510 --> 02:02:19.910
<v Speaker 3>When you saw tj dillashaw my corner in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Canada,</v>

2969
02:02:20.420 --> 02:02:23.690

<v Speaker 3>Canada and tj knew everything.</v>

3086
02:07:15.420 --> 02:07:17.430
<v Speaker 5>That's what I do so well beCause they do</v>
<v Speaker 5>the drilling.</v>

3087
02:07:17.850 --> 02:07:18.683
<v Speaker 5>You start out with this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're going to go wrestling and then </v>

3088
02:07:19.951 --> 02:07:22.520
<v Speaker 5>we're going to go in the clinch back to </v>
<v Speaker 5>strikes fit into like,</v>

3089
02:07:22.530 --> 02:07:25.320
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's goes from this structure.</v>

3090
02:07:25.550 --> 02:07:26.610
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I didn't,</v>

3091
02:07:26.611 --> 02:07:27.444
<v Speaker 5>I never knew knew any of that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like first time I really change your </v>

3092
02:07:29.040 --> 02:07:29.873
<v Speaker 5>jitsu was out here,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like learning it and like blended </v>

3093
02:07:32.190 --> 02:07:34.020
<v Speaker 5>together.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I always said I was a good athlete,</v>

3094
02:07:34.021 --> 02:07:35.540
<v Speaker 5>a good wrestler,</v>
<v Speaker 5>good fight.</v>

3095
02:07:35.630 --> 02:07:36.463
<v Speaker 5>A good boxer by I my own news style here</v>
<v Speaker 5>with like going and doing really the </v>

3096
02:07:42.011 --> 02:07:45.340
<v Speaker 5>first year that I was here I was just </v>
<v Speaker 5>training like for like,</v>

3097
02:07:45.660 --> 02:07:46.890
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he actually told me,</v>

3098
02:07:46.891 --> 02:07:47.724
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bro,</v>

3099
02:07:48.030 --> 02:07:49.730
<v Speaker 3>this is like a little,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3100
02:07:49.731 --> 02:07:51.960
<v Speaker 3>we had to tone it back a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which like I said,</v>

3101
02:07:52.530 --> 02:07:56.400
<v Speaker 3>we have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The team was built on overtraining.</v>

3102
02:07:56.550 --> 02:08:00.750
<v Speaker 3>It was like I didn't take a vacation for</v>
<v Speaker 3>seven years when I started fighting.</v>

3103
02:08:01.320 --> 02:08:03.240
<v Speaker 3>I mean I never took vacations growing up</v>
<v Speaker 3>either.</v>

3104
02:08:03.241 --> 02:08:05.190
<v Speaker 3>We didn't have money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't like something that we did,</v>

3105
02:08:05.191 --> 02:08:06.300
<v Speaker 3>so I'm not like used to like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3106
02:08:06.301 --> 02:08:07.134
<v Speaker 3>we're taking a vacation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like seven years I didn't take a </v>

3107
02:08:09.181 --> 02:08:11.490
<v Speaker 3>vacation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so it was like this grind,</v>

3108
02:08:11.491 --> 02:08:12.121
<v Speaker 3>grind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>grind,</v>

3109
02:08:12.121 --> 02:08:13.570
<v Speaker 3>and everybody's kind of keeping up and </v>
<v Speaker 3>we've,</v>

3110
02:08:13.630 --> 02:08:17.190
<v Speaker 3>we've shifted and gotten smarter and </v>
<v Speaker 3>have more input and etc.</v>

3111
02:08:17.200 --> 02:08:19.560
<v Speaker 3>Etc.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the bottom line for me is this,</v>

3112
02:08:19.830 --> 02:08:22.740
<v Speaker 3>we have a lot of advisors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3113
02:08:22.741 --> 02:08:24.870
<v Speaker 3>And I like it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sage northcutts a great example.</v>

3114
02:08:24.990 --> 02:08:26.070
<v Speaker 3>He can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he'll,</v>

3115
02:08:26.100 --> 02:08:30.960
<v Speaker 3>he'll listen to whoever's talking to him</v>
<v Speaker 3>and like people want to talk to them all</v>

3116
02:08:30.961 --> 02:08:32.010
<v Speaker 3>the time and tell him what to do.</v>

3117
02:08:32.010 --> 02:08:34.240
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like there's advise,</v>

3118
02:08:34.310 --> 02:08:35.940
<v Speaker 3>there's an advisory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like we say,</v>

3119
02:08:35.941 --> 02:08:37.530
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the coaches and I think that you</v>

3120
02:08:37.531 --> 02:08:40.260
<v Speaker 3>need to do this and we need to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you have to be,</v>

3121
02:08:40.261 --> 02:08:41.094
<v Speaker 3>especially at a high level like this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to be a thermometer for your </v>

3122
02:08:44.161 --> 02:08:46.020
<v Speaker 3>own,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for your own stuff as well.</v>

3123
02:08:46.021 --> 02:08:48.510
<v Speaker 3>So we have set practices throughout the </v>
<v Speaker 3>day,</v>

3124
02:08:48.511 --> 02:08:51.210
<v Speaker 3>but if you're feeling way too beat up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3125
02:08:51.211 --> 02:08:52.044
<v Speaker 3>because we're not worried about guys not</v>
<v Speaker 3>showing up to practice because they're </v>

3126
02:08:55.321 --> 02:08:58.340
<v Speaker 3>lazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have the best athletes in the world,</v>

3127
02:08:58.350 --> 02:09:00.810
<v Speaker 3>the rIght mentality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We trusted the mentality and the and the</v>

3128
02:09:00.850 --> 02:09:02.370
<v Speaker 3>purposes they're in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3129
02:09:02.670 --> 02:09:03.503
<v Speaker 3>So if you're feeling too much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to let us know and we'll take a </v>

3130
02:09:05.761 --> 02:09:06.594
<v Speaker 3>little back and do it there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so this is kind of what we found </v>

3131
02:09:07.951 --> 02:09:09.460
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for him as well.</v>

3132
02:09:09.510 --> 02:09:10.343
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you're scheduling everything </v>

3133
02:09:11.191 --> 02:09:12.024
<v Speaker 5>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like there's two schools of thought on </v>

3134
02:09:12.961 --> 02:09:13.794
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's one school of thought that says </v>

3135
02:09:15.031 --> 02:09:17.400
<v Speaker 5>someone should be overseeing everything </v>
<v Speaker 5>for you.</v>

3136
02:09:17.401 --> 02:09:17.940
<v Speaker 5>So you're not</v>

3137
02:09:17.940 --> 02:09:20.780
<v Speaker 3>telling you what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Scheduling is one thing,</v>

3138
02:09:21.020 --> 02:09:24.010
<v Speaker 3>but what's your scheduling?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Scheduling something with a coach.</v>

3139
02:09:24.011 --> 02:09:27.530
<v Speaker 3>He's got a strength and conditioning and</v>
<v Speaker 3>a physical therapists that are making.</v>

3140
02:09:27.650 --> 02:09:30.200
<v Speaker 3>Taking that part of his thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got,</v>

3141
02:09:30.230 --> 02:09:31.063
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>us as head coaches over looking saying </v>

3142
02:09:33.351 --> 02:09:34.820
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we need to make sure that you're getting</v>

3143
02:09:34.821 --> 02:09:35.450
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3144
02:09:35.450 --> 02:09:36.283
<v Speaker 3>this end.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there's coaches every single time </v>

3145
02:09:37.701 --> 02:09:38.534
<v Speaker 3>for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not like you're just on your own </v>

3146
02:09:39.141 --> 02:09:39.974
<v Speaker 3>doing your course.</v>

3147
02:09:40.030 --> 02:09:41.670
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Some people do do it that way.</v>

3148
02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:43.770
<v Speaker 5>Some people like to do everything on </v>
<v Speaker 5>their own,</v>

3149
02:09:43.800 --> 02:09:44.633
<v Speaker 3>which is interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some people would just like to be told </v>

3150
02:09:45.691 --> 02:09:48.390
<v Speaker 3>what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just you're going to do this.</v>

3151
02:09:48.450 --> 02:09:49.260
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3152
02:09:49.260 --> 02:09:50.580
<v Speaker 3>but that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That goes away.</v>

3153
02:09:50.581 --> 02:09:53.480
<v Speaker 3>Which ones somebody fucks you up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

3154
02:09:53.850 --> 02:09:54.980
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like my,</v>

3155
02:09:55.110 --> 02:09:58.690
<v Speaker 5>my australian positionIng coaches,</v>
<v Speaker 5>pt coaches with my mma coach,</v>

3156
02:09:58.750 --> 02:10:00.150
<v Speaker 5>they're all in like coordinates like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

3157
02:10:00.151 --> 02:10:02.460
<v Speaker 5>we went heavy with this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We should ease back this,</v>

3158
02:10:02.461 --> 02:10:03.810
<v Speaker 5>maybe do this many rounds.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

3159
02:10:04.440 --> 02:10:07.420
<v Speaker 5>but that's just started doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think for the cruise by the first time</v>

3160
02:10:07.421 --> 02:10:10.170
<v Speaker 5>we were a heart rate monitor and try to </v>
<v Speaker 5>track where my heart rate was at.</v>

3161
02:10:10.210 --> 02:10:11.043
<v Speaker 5>Was getting up high in the 80 </v>
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible] trying to bring it back </v>

3162
02:10:13.681 --> 02:10:14.514
<v Speaker 5>down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the first time I ever done that </v>

3163
02:10:15.451 --> 02:10:17.440
<v Speaker 5>because what you what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So like when you're doing that,</v>

3164
02:10:17.441 --> 02:10:19.080
<v Speaker 5>are you doing that for strength and </v>
<v Speaker 5>conditioning?</v>

3165
02:10:19.081 --> 02:10:20.440
<v Speaker 5>Are you doing that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Holding paths,</v>

3166
02:10:20.450 --> 02:10:25.450
<v Speaker 5>like how you that that was literally we </v>
<v Speaker 5>would throw for a 90 seconds.</v>

3167
02:10:25.561 --> 02:10:28.980
<v Speaker 5>We would throw.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We do it for six rounds.</v>

3168
02:10:29.510 --> 02:10:30.343
<v Speaker 5>I would throw the same combo.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We had three or four different combos </v>

3169
02:10:32.191 --> 02:10:35.350
<v Speaker 5>that we'd throw for 90 seconds and just </v>
<v Speaker 5>keep the input up,</v>

3170
02:10:35.360 --> 02:10:35.631
<v Speaker 5>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>blah,</v>

3171
02:10:35.631 --> 02:10:36.320
<v Speaker 5>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>blah,</v>

3172
02:10:36.320 --> 02:10:38.250
<v Speaker 5>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ba ba ba bump ba bump,</v>

3173
02:10:38.330 --> 02:10:39.163
<v Speaker 5>four or five punch cabo with affairs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>with the kick or wherever the heart </v>

3174
02:10:42.741 --> 02:10:43.574
<v Speaker 5>rate's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>get checked and then you wait until it </v>

3175
02:10:44.541 --> 02:10:48.830
<v Speaker 5>gets down to what before you go again.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then I think You would have 1:40</v>

3176
02:10:48.831 --> 02:10:49.664
<v Speaker 5>or something.</v>

3177
02:10:51.690 --> 02:10:54.370
<v Speaker 5>I was going to down I think lower than </v>
<v Speaker 5>that one.</v>

3178
02:10:54.590 --> 02:10:56.690
<v Speaker 5>Ads.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So we do that time.</v>

3179
02:10:56.810 --> 02:11:00.140
<v Speaker 5>Have you've given yourself in recovery </v>
<v Speaker 5>times in between?</v>

3180

<v Speaker 5>45 and like in the fight you're like,</v>

<v Speaker 5>like there's no way.</v>

3268
02:14:44.340 --> 02:14:46.660
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we try to get optimistic about it.</v>

3269
02:14:46.700 --> 02:14:50.700
<v Speaker 5>Going to Germany and thinking that was </v>
<v Speaker 5>going to heal miracle miracle,</v>

3270
02:14:50.701 --> 02:14:51.534
<v Speaker 5>miracle shots.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And maybe would have been if you took </v>

3271
02:14:54.571 --> 02:14:57.750
<v Speaker 5>more time off or time off thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like you're a pro athlete,</v>

3272
02:14:57.960 --> 02:14:58.793
<v Speaker 5>so like you're not just having these </v>
<v Speaker 5>procedures and then taking a long time </v>

3273
02:15:02.761 --> 02:15:03.594
<v Speaker 5>to recover,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're having these procedures and then </v>

3274
02:15:04.501 --> 02:15:06.930
<v Speaker 5>trying to get back to training and </v>
<v Speaker 5>pretty quick literally like,</v>

3275
02:15:07.020 --> 02:15:07.853
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had that fight so it was literally </v>

3276
02:15:08.461 --> 02:15:10.560
<v Speaker 5>seven weeks out from when I had the </v>
<v Speaker 5>first stem.</v>

3277
02:15:10.561 --> 02:15:12.670
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then I take a month off,</v>

3278
02:15:12.840 --> 02:15:17.340
<v Speaker 5>take four weeks off and then two weeks </v>
<v Speaker 5>of trying to solve leaves me with a week</v>

3279
02:15:17.341 --> 02:15:19.500
<v Speaker 5>and a half to train for my title fight.</v>

3280
02:15:19.500 --> 02:15:23.460
<v Speaker 5>Like you guys understand that it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>insane and that doesn't even make sense.</v>

3281
02:15:23.790 --> 02:15:26.430

<v Speaker 4>It just a different opponent.</v>

3313
02:16:37.270 --> 02:16:38.103
<v Speaker 4>Well somebody's gotta fight dj.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was kinda bummed out that demetrius </v>

3314
02:16:42.490 --> 02:16:43.323
<v Speaker 4>decided not to fight tj our video.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd never even knew that was an option </v>

3315
02:16:47.260 --> 02:16:48.850
<v Speaker 4>just to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to fight.</v>

3316
02:16:49.210 --> 02:16:50.560
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he said,</v>

3317
02:16:50.620 --> 02:16:51.453
<v Speaker 4>and I guess his mindset is that he's one</v>
<v Speaker 4>fight away from breaking the record of </v>

3318
02:16:56.681 --> 02:17:01.240
<v Speaker 4>the most title defenses ever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if tj being down,</v>

3319
02:17:01.360 --> 02:17:03.970
<v Speaker 4>being able to beat up anyone in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>world and your weight.</v>

3320
02:17:04.020 --> 02:17:04.853
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Which is the important thing to think </v>

3321
02:17:06.251 --> 02:17:07.570
<v Speaker 4>about there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes it is,</v>

3322
02:17:07.870 --> 02:17:11.680
<v Speaker 4>but if he lost a tj and tj didn't make </v>
<v Speaker 4>the weight,</v>

3323
02:17:11.681 --> 02:17:14.550
<v Speaker 4>it would fuck them up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if tj decided not to,</v>

3324
02:17:14.650 --> 02:17:16.600
<v Speaker 4>if he couldn't make the weight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a lot of ifs.</v>

3325
02:17:16.600 --> 02:17:17.433
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of assets a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he wanted tj to fight one time I </v>

3326
02:17:21.240 --> 02:17:25.180
<v Speaker 4>would make sure you can make the and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then fight them.</v>

3327
02:17:25.690 --> 02:17:28.510
<v Speaker 4>I guess it makes sense,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the other thought processes your,</v>

3328
02:17:28.511 --> 02:17:30.580
<v Speaker 4>the pound for pound best fighter on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>planet.</v>

3329
02:17:30.820 --> 02:17:31.653
<v Speaker 4>You should be fighting the best fight </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you can get and that's a really </v>

3330
02:17:34.301 --> 02:17:35.134
<v Speaker 4>good fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like no one's floyd didn't make </v>

3331
02:17:36.971 --> 02:17:38.500
<v Speaker 4>sure economy gregory could make the </v>
<v Speaker 4>weight.</v>

3332
02:17:38.860 --> 02:17:41.450
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they just booked the fight and the light</v>

3333
02:17:41.470 --> 02:17:42.303
<v Speaker 4>on them as a professional,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and jon jones wouldn't fight shale </v>

3334
02:17:44.111 --> 02:17:46.420
<v Speaker 4>though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's because he hated shale though.</v>

3335
02:17:46.480 --> 02:17:47.800
<v Speaker 4>That was part of part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like,</v>

3336
02:17:47.801 --> 02:17:48.634
<v Speaker 4>fuck this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This guy might have a possibility of </v>

3337
02:17:50.471 --> 02:17:51.700
<v Speaker 4>beating me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>

3338
02:17:51.701 --> 02:17:52.150
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll,</v>

3339
02:17:52.150 --> 02:17:54.340
<v Speaker 4>I'll do this through a real camp.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he goes,</v>

3340
02:17:54.341 --> 02:17:56.470
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to come in here and take </v>
<v Speaker 4>this on short notice.</v>

3341
02:17:57.070 --> 02:17:57.903
<v Speaker 4>I don't know man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean he took the osp fight on short </v>

3342
02:17:59.561 --> 02:18:01.440
<v Speaker 4>notice and it wasn't his best fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3343
02:18:01.450 --> 02:18:02.283
<v Speaker 4>he sort of prides himself on having a </v>
<v Speaker 4>long game plan and that's his mentality </v>

3344
02:18:05.920 --> 02:18:06.753
<v Speaker 4>to man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this whole thing is so depressing with </v>

3345
02:18:08.830 --> 02:18:09.663
<v Speaker 4>john.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Apparently we're gonna find out soon </v>

3346
02:18:13.090 --> 02:18:14.950
<v Speaker 4>what's going to happen with the b </v>
<v Speaker 4>sample,</v>

3347
02:18:15.320 --> 02:18:16.153
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if the b sample test positive as </v>

3348
02:18:17.321 --> 02:18:18.430
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's kind of doomed.</v>

3349
02:18:18.760 --> 02:18:22.990
<v Speaker 4>This is doing what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what would be three or four years,</v>

3350
02:18:23.020 --> 02:18:24.940
<v Speaker 4>four years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let that belief.</v>

3351
02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:27.320
<v Speaker 4>I mean obviously I'm not the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>athletic commissioner.</v>

3352
02:18:27.330 --> 02:18:32.050
<v Speaker 4>You saw it or whoever calls it out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think the first one was what?</v>

3353
02:18:32.320 --> 02:18:35.310
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the first one was an out of competent.</v>

3354
02:18:35.590 --> 02:18:36.423
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the first one was a tainted supplement </v>

3355
02:18:38.891 --> 02:18:40.120
<v Speaker 4>and they gave him a year.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3356
02:18:40.210 --> 02:18:42.730
<v Speaker 4>Didn't it give me a year for the dick </v>
<v Speaker 4>pills.</v>

3357
02:18:43.240 --> 02:18:44.720
<v Speaker 4>So was it really dick pills?</v>

3358
02:18:44.720 --> 02:18:49.720
<v Speaker 4>So it was the other test to the pills </v>
<v Speaker 4>blockers.</v>

3359
02:18:50.200 --> 02:18:53.790
<v Speaker 4>They put those in these estrogen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In these messages.</v>

3360
02:18:53.820 --> 02:18:55.800
<v Speaker 4>Gas station dick pills.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3361
02:18:55.810 --> 02:18:58.330
<v Speaker 4>because they make you excited.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They block your estrogen,</v>

3362
02:18:58.450 --> 02:19:00.220
<v Speaker 4>fill you up with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean look,</v>

3363
02:19:00.250 --> 02:19:01.083
<v Speaker 4>they could put whatever the fuck they </v>
<v Speaker 4>want in those things is trying to get </v>

3364
02:19:02.741 --> 02:19:03.574
<v Speaker 4>your dick hard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not.</v>

3365
02:19:03.670 --> 02:19:04.503
<v Speaker 4>They're not thInking that a world class </v>
<v Speaker 4>world champion professional athletes </v>

02:19:08.050 --> 02:19:13.050
<v Speaker 4>taken me of 11 gets he's a maniac.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But don't you think though,</v>

3367
02:19:13.931 --> 02:19:16.780
<v Speaker 4>I mean this is what I've always said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that world class fighters,</v>

3368
02:19:16.781 --> 02:19:17.614
<v Speaker 4>like professional fighters are not like </v>
<v Speaker 4>any other athlete because they're </v>

3369
02:19:19.421 --> 02:19:20.254
<v Speaker 4>fucking reckless.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're wild motherfuckers like cowboy </v>

3370
02:19:22.900 --> 02:19:24.520
<v Speaker 4>like you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like a lot of guys,</v>

3371
02:19:24.880 --> 02:19:28.640
<v Speaker 4>they are impulsive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>reckless risk taking people.</v>

3372
02:19:28.790 --> 02:19:29.390
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3373
02:19:29.390 --> 02:19:30.350
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3374
02:19:30.351 --> 02:19:35.351
<v Speaker 4>I guess I guess disciplined for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean a professional cali kid,</v>

3375
02:19:35.961 --> 02:19:37.030
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

3376
02:19:37.130 --> 02:19:38.300
<v Speaker 4>you're definitely different.</v>

3377
02:19:38.420 --> 02:19:40.400
<v Speaker 4>But there's a lot of different guys in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the sport,</v>

3378
02:19:40.430 --> 02:19:41.263
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that have,</v>

<v Speaker 4>different personalities,</v>

3380
02:19:43.520 --> 02:19:47.030
<v Speaker 4>but a lot of fighters,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a big percentage that are wild.</v>

3381
02:19:47.510 --> 02:19:48.343
<v Speaker 4>And john's fucking wild.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if you want to get a wild </v>

3382
02:19:50.961 --> 02:19:51.794
<v Speaker 4>motherfucker like john who opens up his </v>
<v Speaker 4>fight at 23 years old fighting shogun </v>

3383

<v Speaker 4>for the world title with a flying knee </v>
<v Speaker 4>against shogun.</v>

3384
02:19:59.191 --> 02:20:00.470
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's how I opened the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

3385
02:20:00.640 --> 02:20:03.370
<v Speaker 4>that's a wild impulsive dude.</v>

3389
02:20:08.570 --> 02:20:11.600
<v Speaker 2>let's just do these red lining that all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the time.</v>

3390
02:20:12.150 --> 02:20:14.370
<v Speaker 2>There's no like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

<v Speaker 4>The dick pills.</v>

3393
02:20:19.271 --> 02:20:20.104
<v Speaker 4>That's more of the same.</v>
<v Speaker 4>now this one though is a different </v>

3394
02:20:21.911 --> 02:20:23.170
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is an actual.</v>

3395
02:20:24.010 --> 02:20:26.200
<v Speaker 4>He's not saying anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No one's saying no,</v>

3396
02:20:26.290 --> 02:20:28.690
<v Speaker 4>no official statement.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Talk to my lawyer.</v>

3397
02:20:29.170 --> 02:20:30.003
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean they're saying they didn't do </v>

3398
02:20:30.911 --> 02:20:31.860
<v Speaker 4>anything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3399
02:20:31.870 --> 02:20:32.703
<v Speaker 4>that would Be the most fucked up thing </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the world if somebody slipped some </v>

3400
02:20:34.121 --> 02:20:35.740
<v Speaker 4>shit into your water.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3401
02:20:35.770 --> 02:20:36.603
<v Speaker 4>just to get you to test positive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you got to watch everything you </v>

3402
02:20:38.711 --> 02:20:39.730
<v Speaker 4>fucking eat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3403
02:20:39.780 --> 02:20:40.613
<v Speaker 4>you always have to think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People definitely do double cross </v>

3404
02:20:42.311 --> 02:20:44.050
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Definitely in this world,</v>

3405
02:20:44.320 --> 02:20:48.340
<v Speaker 4>there's somebody who would absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 4>put something tainted in your food.</v>

3406
02:20:48.520 --> 02:20:49.780
<v Speaker 4>All they have to do is sprinkle a little</v>
<v Speaker 4>bit,</v>

3407
02:20:49.781 --> 02:20:53.170
<v Speaker 4>a little bit of it in a dish of food.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You wouldn't even notice it.</v>

3408
02:20:53.560 --> 02:20:54.970
<v Speaker 4>I made you really think that's what </v>
<v Speaker 4>happened.</v>

3409
02:20:55.120 --> 02:20:56.830
<v Speaker 4>I don't think anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know anything.</v>

3410
02:20:56.930 --> 02:20:58.880
<v Speaker 2>I wonder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's true though.</v>

3411
02:20:58.970 --> 02:21:00.980
<v Speaker 2>I mean they're so fucking evil people </v>
<v Speaker 2>out there.</v>

3412
02:21:01.190 --> 02:21:05.090
<v Speaker 2>That's one thing I've learned is getting</v>
<v Speaker 2>older is like just being a nice guy.</v>

3413
02:21:05.091 --> 02:21:05.924
<v Speaker 2>You assume everyone's nice and good and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like there's some creepy negative </v>

3414
02:21:10.760 --> 02:21:11.340
<v Speaker 2>people out there</v>

3415
02:21:11.340 --> 02:21:11.690
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Man.</v>

3416
02:21:11.690 --> 02:21:13.920
<v Speaker 4>It's beautiful when you find nice people</v>
<v Speaker 4>because of that though,</v>

3417
02:21:14.220 --> 02:21:15.053
<v Speaker 4>it balances it out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when you know people that you can </v>

3418
02:21:17.131 --> 02:21:19.500
<v Speaker 4>trust that really are your brother,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's like,</v>

3419
02:21:19.501 --> 02:21:21.900
<v Speaker 4>that makes it all the more it'll give.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everybody was cool.</v>

3420
02:21:21.901 --> 02:21:24.450
<v Speaker 4>You wouldn't necessarily appreciate cool</v>
<v Speaker 4>people as much.</v>

3421
02:21:25.230 --> 02:21:26.070
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3422
02:21:26.071 --> 02:21:26.790
<v Speaker 4>I mean that'd be good</v>

3423
02:21:26.790 --> 02:21:31.320
<v Speaker 2>everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas all the dishes get mad.</v>

3424
02:21:31.340 --> 02:21:34.760
<v Speaker 2>I need an enemy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is.</v>

3425
02:21:35.250 --> 02:21:37.170
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever fought somebody that you </v>

<v Speaker 5>And I'm like,</v>

3570
02:26:55.691 --> 02:26:56.980

<v Speaker 5>tomorrow.</v>

3574
02:27:02.830 --> 02:27:03.663
<v Speaker 5>And then he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>huh?</v>

3575
02:27:04.060 --> 02:27:05.640
<v Speaker 5>Like just being a smart ass.</v>

<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he'S sick.</v>

3577
02:27:05.950 --> 02:27:07.690

<v Speaker 5>been choked up.</v>

3578
02:27:07.930 --> 02:27:09.610

<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

3579
02:27:09.640 --> 02:27:10.473
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

3585
02:27:17.881 --> 02:27:19.270

<v Speaker 5>I danced around you and beat your ass </v>
<v Speaker 5>and made you look like a fool.</v>

3587
02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:23.290
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sit behind a desk and shut up.</v>

3588
02:27:23.680 --> 02:27:26.800
<v Speaker 5>And then it was like this that go on </v>
<v Speaker 5>skype.</v>

3589
02:27:26.801 --> 02:27:29.590
<v Speaker 5>Just as old as a private conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Private conversations goes black screen,</v>

3590
02:27:29.591 --> 02:27:30.490
<v Speaker 5>the producers come on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're like,</v>

3591
02:27:30.491 --> 02:27:31.324
<v Speaker 5>we're sorry how dominic was acting like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't mind coming on here and doing </v>

3592
02:27:35.051 --> 02:27:35.884
<v Speaker 5>this shit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I.</v>

3593
02:27:36.520 --> 02:27:37.570
<v Speaker 5>The first thing I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey dominic,</v>

3594
02:27:37.571 --> 02:27:39.160
<v Speaker 5>how are you?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I was like,</v>

3595
02:27:39.161 --> 02:27:40.420
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just waiting for dominic's and say hi.</v>

3596
02:27:40.421 --> 02:27:41.560
<v Speaker 5>And he started off.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He goes,</v>

3597
02:27:41.561 --> 02:27:42.394
<v Speaker 5>I don't get to say hi to you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm talking to you in a couple of </v>

3598
02:27:43.201 --> 02:27:44.530
<v Speaker 5>minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I was like,</v>

3599
02:27:44.550 --> 02:27:45.383
<v Speaker 5>oh god,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck you guys are probably </v>

3600
02:27:46.991 --> 02:27:48.850
<v Speaker 5>going to fight again if tom stays in the</v>
<v Speaker 5>game.</v>

3601
02:27:49.270 --> 02:27:53.040
<v Speaker 5>So we had to redo the whole sItuation </v>
<v Speaker 5>and he just sitting there like,</v>

3602
02:27:53.100 --> 02:27:55.100
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because I was like,</v>

3603
02:27:55.120 --> 02:27:55.990
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's cool.</v>

3604
02:27:56.400 --> 02:27:58.360
<v Speaker 5>So that's why I wanted the rematch with </v>
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>

3605
02:27:58.361 --> 02:27:59.194
<v Speaker 5>so honestly tj should thank don for not </v>
<v Speaker 5>taking the rematch and finally getting </v>

3606
02:28:03.260 --> 02:28:05.410
<v Speaker 5>his shot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that's why after the fight.</v>

3607
02:28:05.420 --> 02:28:07.830
<v Speaker 5>So tj tom Doing these days,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3608
02:28:07.840 --> 02:28:08.673
<v Speaker 5>I know he has plantar fasciitis,</v>
<v Speaker 5>got some serious issues with his feet </v>

3609
02:28:11.111 --> 02:28:11.944
<v Speaker 5>because he came back real quick after </v>
<v Speaker 5>the knee surgery anD maybe pushed it a </v>

3610
02:28:14.621 --> 02:28:16.040
<v Speaker 5>little too hard.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a,</v>

3611
02:28:16.060 --> 02:28:16.893
<v Speaker 5>that's a tough one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean tHat's why his feet were all </v>

3612
02:28:18.580 --> 02:28:20.910
<v Speaker 5>taped up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's doing a lot of commentary on.</v>

3613
02:28:21.550 --> 02:28:23.720
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm probably getting decent manager that</v>

3614
02:28:23.721 --> 02:28:25.520
<v Speaker 5>I talked to his coach.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're going to try to get,</v>

3615
02:28:25.670 --> 02:28:26.820
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we didn't win,</v>

3616
02:28:27.150 --> 02:28:27.983
<v Speaker 5>it was scheduled,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he was trying to fight on the same </v>

3617
02:28:29.841 --> 02:28:31.130
<v Speaker 5>cart or around about.</v>

3618
02:28:31.130 --> 02:28:31.963
<v Speaker 5>So it keeps in the transition.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Who do you think would be a good fight </v>

3619
02:28:34.611 --> 02:28:36.310
<v Speaker 5>for him to fight for?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dominic?</v>

3620
02:28:36.470 --> 02:28:38.570
<v Speaker 5>It's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 5>WIthout a riviera.</v>

3621
02:28:39.250 --> 02:28:40.950
<v Speaker 5>Very good fight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Very good fight.</v>

3622
02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:43.700
<v Speaker 5>But I think doesn't he?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Doesn't jimmy have a fight?</v>

3623
02:28:45.310 --> 02:28:47.690
<v Speaker 5>He just beat the dude that you knocked </v>
<v Speaker 5>out.</v>

3624
02:28:48.510 --> 02:28:50.510
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he alomeda he'd be,</v>

3625
02:28:50.580 --> 02:28:53.180
<v Speaker 5>he'd be out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dropped him a couple times.</v>

3626
02:28:53.200 --> 02:28:54.030
<v Speaker 5>That was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3627
02:28:54.030 --> 02:28:55.800
<v Speaker 5>it was a very good fight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's already beat it.</v>

3628
02:28:55.801 --> 02:28:56.634
<v Speaker 5>I made it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I feel like he has another fight </v>

3629
02:28:57.560 --> 02:28:58.730
<v Speaker 5>lined up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe I'm wrong.</v>

3630
02:28:58.880 --> 02:29:01.500
<v Speaker 5>Maybe it was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm thinking of um,</v>

3631
02:29:01.630 --> 02:29:03.430
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the day Before the fight,</v>

3632
02:29:03.431 --> 02:29:06.560
<v Speaker 5>like hype before the fight is always so </v>
<v Speaker 5>interesting to see how people react,</v>

3633
02:29:06.561 --> 02:29:07.394
<v Speaker 5>see where their head's at.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like when connor came out with a heart </v>

3634
02:29:09.171 --> 02:29:11.600
<v Speaker 5>on against floyd.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What is,</v>

3635
02:29:11.930 --> 02:29:12.763
<v Speaker 5>what is he doing?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is he fucking wearing a rubber band </v>

3636
02:29:14.511 --> 02:29:16.430
<v Speaker 5>around his ticket balls just to get it </v>
<v Speaker 5>hard?</v>

3637
02:29:16.430 --> 02:29:19.400
<v Speaker 5>Or is he playing with himself before he </v>
<v Speaker 5>gets out there?</v>

3638
02:29:19.401 --> 02:29:23.270
<v Speaker 5>a couple shakes before he gets on his </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking dick was half hard,</v>

3639
02:29:23.271 --> 02:29:28.271
<v Speaker 5>but he's standing there hard and that's </v>
<v Speaker 5>just what it looks like when it's limp,</v>

3640
02:29:28.880 --> 02:29:29.713
<v Speaker 5>but it literally looked like it was half</v>
<v Speaker 5>hard when he's standing there at the </v>

3641
02:29:31.900 --> 02:29:34.870
<v Speaker 5>wind.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like a siren.</v>

3642
02:29:35.300 --> 02:29:37.640
<v Speaker 5>The hill.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've seen a couple of the guys,</v>

3643
02:29:37.641 --> 02:29:42.110
<v Speaker 5>I think mcgill dixit way and a couple </v>
<v Speaker 5>other guys that had that same thing.</v>

3644
02:29:42.111 --> 02:29:42.944
<v Speaker 5>I think it's like an involuntary thing </v>
<v Speaker 5>that happens when you're like hungry or </v>

3645
02:29:45.921 --> 02:29:46.754
<v Speaker 5>something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I dunno.</v>

3646
02:29:47.270 --> 02:29:49.610
<v Speaker 5>I'll tell you what.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Get survival.</v>

3647
02:29:49.700 --> 02:29:50.533
<v Speaker 5>We have to go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We haD to get real creative on the </v>

3648
02:29:51.981 --> 02:29:52.814
<v Speaker 5>physical anthropology of why you get a </v>
<v Speaker 5>hard out when you're about to get into </v>

3649
02:29:56.030 --> 02:29:56.863
<v Speaker 5>confrontation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe you're going to fight over a </v>

3650
02:29:58.131 --> 02:29:58.964
<v Speaker 5>female out the nature and I can maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was just such a weird problem when </v>

3651
02:30:02.890 --> 02:30:03.200
<v Speaker 5>stinks.</v>

3652
02:30:03.200 --> 02:30:04.033
<v Speaker 5>Confrontation to connor screaming,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yelling at him or for just standing </v>

3653
02:30:06.651 --> 02:30:09.170
<v Speaker 5>there literally like not a worry in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>world.</v>

3654
02:30:09.200 --> 02:30:11.220
<v Speaker 5>It was interesting how floyd handled it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3655
02:30:11.680 --> 02:30:14.510
<v Speaker 5>He didn't have a worry in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're seeing that.</v>

3656
02:30:14.511 --> 02:30:19.190
<v Speaker 5>I see composed because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're so composed 50 and oh man,</v>

3657
02:30:19.280 --> 02:30:20.040
<v Speaker 5>15.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

3658
02:30:20.040 --> 02:30:20.873
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'd said that he was the only guy that </v>

3659
02:30:21.951 --> 02:30:22.784
<v Speaker 5>ever reached that and break that record,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but apparently there was some other guy </v>

3660
02:30:25.190 --> 02:30:30.190
<v Speaker 5>that had fought and I'm like a really </v>
<v Speaker 5>light weight that made 51 zero.</v>

3661
02:30:30.710 --> 02:30:31.311
<v Speaker 5>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3662
02:30:31.311 --> 02:30:32.144
<v Speaker 5>That I didn't even know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I thought they were talking about rocky </v>

3663
02:30:35.160 --> 02:30:35.993
<v Speaker 5>marciano.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was taught that that was the record </v>

3664
02:30:37.260 --> 02:30:38.093
<v Speaker 5>for the child is it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wasn't he like up there before he got </v>

3665
02:30:40.430 --> 02:30:41.630
<v Speaker 5>defeated too?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Good question.</v>

3666
02:30:41.631 --> 02:30:45.590
<v Speaker 5>But he didn't retire with question one </v>
<v Speaker 5>was like six years.</v>

3667
02:30:45.830 --> 02:30:47.300
<v Speaker 5>RicArdo lopez?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3668
02:30:47.301 --> 02:30:50.390
<v Speaker 5>He was a.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What wait was.</v>

3669
02:30:50.391 --> 02:30:54.260
<v Speaker 5>He doesn't say light flyweight yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What?</v>

3670
02:30:54.270 --> 02:30:55.940
<v Speaker 5>What is that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What is light flyweight?</v>

3671
02:30:56.030 --> 02:30:58.490
<v Speaker 5>Minimum waiting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jesus minimum.</v>

3672
02:30:58.491 --> 02:31:00.080
<v Speaker 5>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck is minimum way.</v>

3673
02:31:00.290 --> 02:31:02.780
<v Speaker 5>But ricardo lopez a.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe he,</v>

3674
02:31:02.840 --> 02:31:05.840
<v Speaker 5>I believe he retired at 51 and.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh.</v>

3675
02:31:05.920 --> 02:31:08.750
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he retired somewhere around that range.</v>

3676
02:31:09.350 --> 02:31:11.910
<v Speaker 5>Does it say one girl?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3677
02:31:11.930 --> 02:31:13.130
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we had to draw 50.</v>

3678
02:31:13.131 --> 02:31:15.610
<v Speaker 5>One wins,</v>
<v Speaker 5>zero losses and one draw.</v>

3679
02:31:16.300 --> 02:31:18.480
<v Speaker 5>The one draws the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's so funny.</v>

3680
02:31:18.620 --> 02:31:20.100
<v Speaker 5>People about that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's so</v>

3681
02:31:20.100 --> 02:31:20.933
<v Speaker 4>weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's one thing about mma fighters as </v>

3682
02:31:23.311 --> 02:31:27.300
<v Speaker 4>opposed to boxers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Boxer who was always undefeated record.</v>

3683
02:31:27.480 --> 02:31:29.820
<v Speaker 4>That was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's such a big selling point in the.</v>

3684
02:31:29.821 --> 02:31:30.654
<v Speaker 4>In the.</v>

3685
02:31:31.960 --> 02:31:32.793
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anD I guess it makes sense though </v>

3686
02:31:33.401 --> 02:31:36.940
<v Speaker 2>because I mean you're trying to make a </v>
<v Speaker 2>case that nolan could,</v>

3687
02:31:37.160 --> 02:31:37.993
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something intriguing about </v>

3688
02:31:38.741 --> 02:31:41.550
<v Speaker 2>somebody that can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that no one could ever beat this person,</v>

3689
02:31:41.610 --> 02:31:44.040
<v Speaker 4>but the difference between mma and </v>
<v Speaker 4>boxing and mma,</v>

3690
02:31:44.041 --> 02:31:44.874
<v Speaker 4>you're tested way more on the way up to </v>
<v Speaker 4>the title and you're fighting world </v>

3691
02:31:47.701 --> 02:31:50.850
<v Speaker 4>class fighters pretty quickly soon as </v>
<v Speaker 4>you start getting to zero.</v>

3692
02:31:50.910 --> 02:31:54.180
<v Speaker 4>Whereas in boxing you're taking care of </v>
<v Speaker 4>your record,</v>

3693
02:31:54.181 --> 02:31:58.020
<v Speaker 4>gets pad and you're slowly worked up to </v>
<v Speaker 4>a world class fighter.</v>

3694
02:31:58.021 --> 02:31:58.890
<v Speaker 4>If you have a good manager,</v>

3695
02:31:58.940 --> 02:32:02.960
<v Speaker 2>maybe 15 to 20 fights and you're trying </v>
<v Speaker 2>to maybe start fighting some.</v>

3696
02:32:03.020 --> 02:32:03.860
<v Speaker 2>OkAy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People,</v>

3697
02:32:03.960 --> 02:32:04.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially with you.</v>

3698
02:32:04.850 --> 02:32:05.683
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you think that that's the way to do </v>

3699
02:32:06.321 --> 02:32:08.140
<v Speaker 2>it now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

3700
02:32:08.180 --> 02:32:09.013
<v Speaker 2>With those guys know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because a lot of those boxers have had </v>

3701
02:32:11.781 --> 02:32:13.160
<v Speaker 2>three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>400 amateur fights.</v>

3702
02:32:13.280 --> 02:32:14.113
<v Speaker 2>Not like they don't need groomed into.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That may be to get out of the shoe </v>

3703
02:32:17.481 --> 02:32:20.360
<v Speaker 2>shining amateur style,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but switching notes,</v>

3704
02:32:20.380 --> 02:32:21.920
<v Speaker 2>a headgear getting taken away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's more,</v>

3705
02:32:21.921 --> 02:32:22.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

3706
02:32:22.220 --> 02:32:25.820
<v Speaker 2>it's set up and the point system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how it's changing with the olympics,</v>

3707
02:32:25.821 --> 02:32:26.654
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>taken into headgear off and how they're </v>

3708
02:32:28.190 --> 02:32:31.240
<v Speaker 2>changing all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they're coming more professional,</v>

3709
02:32:31.260 --> 02:32:32.510
<v Speaker 2>setting stuff up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not that,</v>

3710
02:32:32.840 --> 02:32:34.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pitter patter shit to shine,</v>

3711
02:32:35.570 --> 02:32:37.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that's how it's been.</v>

3712
02:32:37.011 --> 02:32:39.920
<v Speaker 2>But I don't think they need to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be like that.</v>

3713
02:32:39.921 --> 02:32:41.390
<v Speaker 2>But I think in boxing is a huge records.</v>

3714
02:32:41.390 --> 02:32:41.980
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3715
02:32:41.980 --> 02:32:45.800
<v Speaker 2>he's 37.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh it's 28 knockout we're gig.</v>

3716
02:32:45.801 --> 02:32:49.670
<v Speaker 2>I mean I guess the difference with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

3717
02:32:49.740 --> 02:32:50.573
<v Speaker 2>with ufc is use has always had a </v>
<v Speaker 2>reputation of putting the best fighters </v>

3718
02:32:55.131 --> 02:32:55.964
<v Speaker 2>against the best fighters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I think has gone away a little </v>

3719
02:32:58.161 --> 02:32:58.994
<v Speaker 2>bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they still make sure you get </v>

3720
02:32:59.660 --> 02:33:01.130
<v Speaker 2>testeD.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think it's gone away?</v>

3721
02:33:01.220 --> 02:33:04.820
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's going away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think when they try to do is have even</v>

3722
02:33:04.821 --> 02:33:08.230
<v Speaker 2>matchups because there's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a uh,</v>

3723
02:33:08.270 --> 02:33:10.860
<v Speaker 2>ricci and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

3724
02:33:11.100 --> 02:33:13.640
<v Speaker 2>and what's his name?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who's fighting alvarez for example?</v>

3725
02:33:13.970 --> 02:33:15.560
<v Speaker 2>They just want to see that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3726
02:33:15.561 --> 02:33:16.394
<v Speaker 2>they're both very tough guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can be a champion and and her just </v>

3727
02:33:20.900 --> 02:33:22.550
<v Speaker 2>teaching,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they want to see matches,</v>

3728
02:33:22.551 --> 02:33:25.220
<v Speaker 2>but they do that all the way down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like tHey're not gonna,</v>

3729
02:33:25.250 --> 02:33:28.870
<v Speaker 2>they're not trying to set up mismatches.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>

3730
02:33:29.170 --> 02:33:31.330
<v Speaker 2>they're trying to get it more evenly </v>
<v Speaker 2>matched,</v>

3731
02:33:31.340 --> 02:33:32.173
<v Speaker 2>but that doesn't mean that there aren't </v>
<v Speaker 2>guys that they could set up with </v>

3732
02:33:34.120 --> 02:33:36.080
<v Speaker 2>mismatches within the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>within the</v>

02:33:37.620 --> 02:33:39.830

3734
02:33:39.831 --> 02:33:40.664
<v Speaker 4>It's a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or boxing guys get tuned up fights and </v>

3735
02:33:43.580 --> 02:33:44.413
<v Speaker 4>you even call them a tune up fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's getting a tune up fight before the </v>

3736
02:33:46.851 --> 02:33:47.970
<v Speaker 4>big match.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3737
02:33:48.080 --> 02:33:48.913
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they go in there and they fight a </v>

3738
02:33:49.971 --> 02:33:54.320
<v Speaker 4>guy that's not expected to win and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>they get sent off for the next fight but</v>

<v Speaker 2>lot though,</v>

<v Speaker 3>et cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I saw him do a,</v>

3768
02:35:05.761 --> 02:35:07.130
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

3770
02:35:08.851 --> 02:35:09.684
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I talked about coaches making you do </v>

3771
02:35:11.521 --> 02:35:13.110
<v Speaker 3>shit just in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're just like,</v>

3772
02:35:13.140 --> 02:35:15.090
<v Speaker 3>do whatever the coach says.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was like,</v>

3773
02:35:15.091 --> 02:35:15.924
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been doing with all the coaches </v>

3774
02:35:16.621 --> 02:35:17.700
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>

3775
02:35:17.730 --> 02:35:18.930
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I keep getting hurt.</v>

3776
02:35:18.931 --> 02:35:20.100
<v Speaker 3>I keep doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And now he goes,</v>

3777
02:35:20.101 --> 02:35:22.500
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to take things into my own </v>
<v Speaker 3>hands a little bit more.</v>

3778
02:35:22.910 --> 02:35:23.970
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's the guy that did that,</v>

3779
02:35:23.971 --> 02:35:24.804
<v Speaker 3>but he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's having a lot of friggen success </v>

3780
02:35:26.550 --> 02:35:28.890
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He looked like a fucking world killer.</v>

3781
02:35:29.050 --> 02:35:33.010
<v Speaker 3>And he'd be paul daley.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He looked perfectly savage to.</v>

3782
02:35:33.030 --> 02:35:33.430
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

3783
02:35:33.430 --> 02:35:35.680
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's gonna be an interesting fight.</v>

3784
02:35:35.710 --> 02:35:38.080
<v Speaker 4>Paul daley and lorenz larkin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

3785
02:35:39.040 --> 02:35:42.790
<v Speaker 4>Explosive style.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Supercycle kicks.</v>

3786
02:35:42.800 --> 02:35:43.580
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll just.</v>

3787
02:35:43.580 --> 02:35:45.880
<v Speaker 4>How this longer than use.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nope.</v>

3788
02:35:46.300 --> 02:35:49.310
<v Speaker 4>Nolan's lorenz larkin just fought </v>
<v Speaker 4>douglas lema for the title.</v>

3789
02:35:49.311 --> 02:35:52.420
<v Speaker 4>We lost a five round decision.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Very close fight.</v>

3790
02:35:52.421 --> 02:35:54.520
<v Speaker 4>Very good fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Douglas slam is another one.</v>

3791
02:35:54.521 --> 02:35:56.080
<v Speaker 4>That guy is world class.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3792
02:35:56.081 --> 02:35:56.914
<v Speaker 4>he is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's right up there with anybody in the </v>

3793
02:35:57.641 --> 02:35:58.960
<v Speaker 4>world at one 70,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in my opinion.</v>

3794
02:35:59.070 --> 02:36:01.410
<v Speaker 4>He's been around for awhile too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3795
02:36:01.450 --> 02:36:02.283
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what pisses me off is ben </v>

3796
02:36:03.480 --> 02:36:07.170
<v Speaker 4>aspirins still fighting over in one fc </v>
<v Speaker 4>like jesus christ I,</v>

3797
02:36:07.390 --> 02:36:11.890
<v Speaker 4>I am the number one district of his </v>
<v Speaker 4>retirement fight.</v>

3798
02:36:11.891 --> 02:36:13.810
<v Speaker 4>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It drives me crazy.</v>

3799
02:36:13.840 --> 02:36:16.900
<v Speaker 4>Should've been the ufc a long time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I always wanted to see that</v>

3800
02:36:17.490 --> 02:36:19.620
<v Speaker 3>pissed off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dana and his style is weird,</v>

3801
02:36:19.621 --> 02:36:19.990
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3802
02:36:19.990 --> 02:36:21.460
<v Speaker 4>The style is weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's one thing,</v>

3803
02:36:21.461 --> 02:36:23.830
<v Speaker 4>but pissing off dana was ultimately the </v>
<v Speaker 4>end of it all.</v>

3804
02:36:23.890 --> 02:36:25.930
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was talking some serious shit.</v>

3805
02:36:29.300 --> 02:36:31.420
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's too bad.</v>

3806
02:36:31.720 --> 02:36:33.550
<v Speaker 4>That's too bad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really bad.</v>

3807
02:36:33.551 --> 02:36:35.830
<v Speaker 4>I will have it mixed up with this guy </v>
<v Speaker 4>and fuck you.</v>

3808
02:36:35.831 --> 02:36:39.790
<v Speaker 4>I would have loved to see that guy fight</v>
<v Speaker 4>the best in the world in the ufc,</v>

3809
02:36:39.791 --> 02:36:40.840
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and we'll never know.</v>

3810
02:36:40.841 --> 02:36:42.160
<v Speaker 4>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's really unfortunate.</v>

3811
02:36:42.730 --> 02:36:45.340
<v Speaker 4>He made some decent money over there and</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hope you did.</v>

3812
02:36:45.400 --> 02:36:47.940
<v Speaker 4>I hope we did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's just a fucking phenomenal grappler,</v>

3813
02:36:48.050 --> 02:36:49.930
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here's a perfect example.</v>

3814
02:36:50.260 --> 02:36:51.093
<v Speaker 4>That guy destroyed larkin on the ground </v>
<v Speaker 4>or it's not locking lima destroyed him </v>

3815
02:36:55.241 --> 02:36:58.930
<v Speaker 4>on the ground and destroyed core cuff on</v>
<v Speaker 4>the ground just to be manhandled.</v>

3816
02:36:58.990 --> 02:37:01.780
<v Speaker 4>Those dudes got a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Of those guys was ragdoll and fools.</v>

3817
02:37:01.781 --> 02:37:06.580
<v Speaker 4>Just throwing them around like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>An orthodox weird wrestling style.</v>

3818
02:37:06.610 --> 02:37:08.790
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't have wanted to see him fight </v>
<v Speaker 4>the best guys.</v>

3819
02:37:09.080 --> 02:37:10.580
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know who had been a.</v>

3820
02:37:10.910 --> 02:37:15.160
<v Speaker 3>He would have been a terrible matchup </v>
<v Speaker 3>for is george st pierre was.</v>

3821
02:37:15.350 --> 02:37:16.310
<v Speaker 3>George always</v>

3822
02:37:16.370 --> 02:37:19.490
<v Speaker 2>saw he starts hitting his nice little </v>
<v Speaker 2>shots,</v>

3823
02:37:19.491 --> 02:37:21.390
<v Speaker 2>but he always ends up getting the nice </v>
<v Speaker 2>tape now.</v>

3824
02:37:21.391 --> 02:37:23.360
<v Speaker 2>But how was he going to do in grappling </v>
<v Speaker 2>against?</v>

3825
02:37:23.361 --> 02:37:24.520
<v Speaker 2>Asked her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That would've been a good one.</v>

3826
02:37:24.521 --> 02:37:26.480
<v Speaker 2>I saw and I always wanted to see too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3827
02:37:26.481 --> 02:37:28.760
<v Speaker 2>you know that got him in trouble with </v>
<v Speaker 2>johny hendricks.</v>

3828
02:37:28.761 --> 02:37:31.040
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But johnny hunters is a different Johnny</v>

3829
02:37:31.040 --> 02:37:31.873
<v Speaker 2>Hendricks back then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3842
02:38:05.331 --> 02:38:05.811
<v Speaker 2>time like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>he's retired.</v>

3845
02:38:10.521 --> 02:38:12.300
<v Speaker 2>Are you kind of retired?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mostly.</v>

3846
02:38:12.770 --> 02:38:14.780
<v Speaker 2>Mostly retired.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm retired.</v>

3847
02:38:14.781 --> 02:38:15.614
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

3848
02:38:15.920 --> 02:38:18.470
<v Speaker 2>I'm definitely retired,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not a first off.</v>

3849
02:38:18.471 --> 02:38:19.304
<v Speaker 2>I love the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the hard thing about retiring is </v>

3850
02:38:20.931 --> 02:38:25.160
<v Speaker 2>it takes so much time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>energy and there's so much to learn that</v>

3851
02:38:25.161 --> 02:38:25.994
<v Speaker 2>I'm definitely a better fighter when I </v>
<v Speaker 2>retired than I than I was when I was in </v>

3852
02:38:31.450 --> 02:38:34.640
<v Speaker 2>my prime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Meaning as far as skillset goes,</v>

3853
02:38:35.090 --> 02:38:35.923
<v Speaker 2>but like there's a lot of skill guys out</v>
<v Speaker 2>there and it's just like a focus thing </v>

3854
02:38:39.391 --> 02:38:42.100
<v Speaker 2>and a motivation thing like.</v>

3858
02:38:48.561 --> 02:38:50.280
<v Speaker 2>knew that so many guys were using shade?</v>
