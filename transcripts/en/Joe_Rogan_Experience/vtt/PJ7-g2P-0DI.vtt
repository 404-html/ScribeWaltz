00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.650
<v Speaker 1>The Joe Rogan experience,</v>

2
00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:03.060
<v Speaker 1>I had my wisdom teeth pulled,</v>

3
00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:04.020
<v Speaker 1>same kind of thing.</v>

4
00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:04.960
<v Speaker 1>Excellent doctor,</v>

5
00:00:04.961 --> 00:00:05.251
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

6
00:00:05.251 --> 00:00:07.860
<v Speaker 1>He prescribed me like 60 vicodins.</v>

7
00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.570
<v Speaker 1>The next day I was eating burritos.</v>

8
00:00:09.571 --> 00:00:09.961
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

9
00:00:09.961 --> 00:00:10.201
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

10
00:00:10.201 --> 00:00:10.441
<v Speaker 1>this is.</v>

11
00:00:10.441 --> 00:00:12.300
<v Speaker 1>I was expecting this worst pain in my life.</v>

12
00:00:12.301 --> 00:00:14.040
<v Speaker 1>Everybody told me it was going to be the worst thing ever.</v>

13
00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:15.990
<v Speaker 1>The wisdom teeth getting pulled was I was,</v>

14
00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:18.750
<v Speaker 1>I was prepared for hell and I woke up the next day.</v>

15
00:00:18.751 --> 00:00:19.351
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

16
00:00:19.351 --> 00:00:20.280
<v Speaker 1>this is great.</v>

17
00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.060
<v Speaker 1>And I literally had those pills in my,</v>

18
00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.100
<v Speaker 1>in my cabinet forever until I figured out,</v>

19
00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:31.500
<v Speaker 1>and this was like 20 something years ago that a half a vicodin and a and a glass</v>

20
00:00:31.501 --> 00:00:33.260
<v Speaker 1>of whiskey is so good time for awhile,</v>

21
00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.253
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

22
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.400
<v Speaker 1>And so I came very close to becoming like kind of strung out there on pills</v>

23
00:00:38.401 --> 00:00:40.110
<v Speaker 1>until I caught myself literally like,</v>

24
00:00:40.111 --> 00:00:40.591
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>

25
00:00:40.591 --> 00:00:41.490
<v Speaker 1>this is getting out of hand.</v>

26
00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:42.893
<v Speaker 1>And I was able to just,</v>

27
00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.511
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

28
00:00:43.511 --> 00:00:43.820
<v Speaker 1>I was.</v>

29
00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.450
<v Speaker 1>I luckily have that kind of personality.</v>

30
00:00:45.451 --> 00:00:47.700
<v Speaker 1>I've never been really super addictive personality,</v>

31
00:00:47.701 --> 00:00:51.240
<v Speaker 1>so I've been able to recognize a few times when I got close to like this could</v>

32
00:00:51.241 --> 00:00:51.860
<v Speaker 1>get out of hand.</v>

33
00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:52.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

34
00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:53.460
<v Speaker 1>The luckily man,</v>

35
00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.500
<v Speaker 1>I tell people that I smoked crack once.</v>

36
00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.023
<v Speaker 1>What was that like?</v>

37
00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:57.900
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

38
00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:58.890
<v Speaker 1>it was bananas.</v>

39
00:00:58.891 --> 00:01:00.510
<v Speaker 1>It was like the craziest,</v>

40
00:01:00.511 --> 00:01:02.610
<v Speaker 1>greatest rush for like 35,</v>

41
00:01:02.611 --> 00:01:07.611
<v Speaker 1>40 seconds and then it was gone and it was like I wanted more and a guy I used</v>

42
00:01:07.741 --> 00:01:08.330
<v Speaker 1>to live with,</v>

43
00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:13.330
<v Speaker 1>he was a crack so I won't even call it dealer a seller.</v>

44
00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:14.820
<v Speaker 1>He just kind of sold it.</v>

45
00:01:14.821 --> 00:01:17.190
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't even dealing because he wasn't even doing very well with crack and</v>

46
00:01:17.191 --> 00:01:17.580
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

47
00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

48
00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:18.631
<v Speaker 1>I don't even understand,</v>

49
00:01:18.631 --> 00:01:19.320
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>

50
00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.830
<v Speaker 1>So like one night I was just kinda chipped off a piece and as I smoke some crack</v>

51
00:01:22.831 --> 00:01:22.981
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

52

<v Speaker 1>I was curious man.</v>

53
00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.520
<v Speaker 1>But I recognized right away though.</v>

54
00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.800
<v Speaker 1>I guess I know why people lose their lives behind this shit.</v>

55
00:01:28.801 --> 00:01:29.634
<v Speaker 1>New Small crack.</v>

<v Speaker 1>What was that like?</v>

58
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.640
<v Speaker 1>I didn't like it.</v>

59
00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:33.630
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was just,</v>

60
00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.550
<v Speaker 1>it smelled weird and smell is off.</v>

61

<v Speaker 1>Putting taste is not good,</v>

62
00:01:37.291 --> 00:01:37.981
<v Speaker 1>but like the rush,</v>

63

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:22.150
<v Speaker 2>Shiny leather on the bottom of your toes?</v>

148
00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.010
<v Speaker 2>They all slippery and stupid.</v>

149
00:04:24.011 --> 00:04:24.710
<v Speaker 2>That is,</v>

150
00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:25.990
<v Speaker 2>I guess scuffling at all.</v>

151
00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:27.040
<v Speaker 2>What's with the tassels?</v>

152
00:04:27.041 --> 00:04:31.150
<v Speaker 2>You fucking halfway tassels on the funnier shoes.</v>

153
00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:35.380
<v Speaker 2>What is that extra fancy you fucking retard.</v>

154
00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:39.130
<v Speaker 2>A leather tassel and silly and ancient.</v>

155
00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:41.950
<v Speaker 2>Retarded and dum de dum,</v>

156
00:04:41.951 --> 00:04:42.820
<v Speaker 2>de dum.</v>

157
00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:44.680
<v Speaker 2>Who cares how you dress?</v>

158
00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.170
<v Speaker 1>Remember how we started Joe,</v>

159
00:04:46.171 --> 00:04:46.531
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

160
00:04:46.531 --> 00:04:47.041
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't.</v>

161
00:04:47.041 --> 00:04:47.611
<v Speaker 1>Everyone goes,</v>

162
00:04:47.611 --> 00:04:47.761
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

163
00:04:47.761 --> 00:04:48.600
<v Speaker 1>there are no rules.</v>

164
00:04:48.601 --> 00:04:51.510
<v Speaker 1>One man enter six men leave whatever we were saying,</v>

165
00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:52.500
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

166
00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:56.640
<v Speaker 1>we couldn't figure out how to put the different fighting sports together.</v>

167
00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.130
<v Speaker 1>So whose rules to use.</v>

168
00:04:59.180 --> 00:04:59.770
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

169
00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:02.700
<v Speaker 1>And so really the basis of the UFC was always,</v>

170
00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:04.673
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

171
00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.050
<v Speaker 1>no rules became this huge thing,</v>

172
00:05:07.051 --> 00:05:11.880
<v Speaker 1>but it was also whose rules to use mean now you're going to get a boxer against</v>

173
00:05:11.881 --> 00:05:12.714
<v Speaker 1>did you Jitsu Guy,</v>

174
00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:14.130
<v Speaker 1>what are you going to use?</v>

175
00:05:14.131 --> 00:05:14.580
<v Speaker 1>You can't,</v>

176
00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:15.960
<v Speaker 1>there's no rules you can use.</v>

177
00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:17.940
<v Speaker 1>Did anybody try to gouge eyes?</v>

178
00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:20.640
<v Speaker 1>Was that it was illegal in the early one.</v>

179
00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:21.480
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

180
00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:22.260
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean,</v>

181
00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.900
<v Speaker 1>I always would hear about these wing Chun Masters.</v>

182
00:05:24.901 --> 00:05:29.100
<v Speaker 1>They had 50 ways to pop your eye out with their thumb and I kept calling them</v>

183
00:05:29.101 --> 00:05:29.341
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>

184
00:05:29.341 --> 00:05:31.470
<v Speaker 1>bring your thumbs and do it man.</v>

185
00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:32.390
<v Speaker 2>Don't talk about it.</v>

186
00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:33.141
<v Speaker 2>Come and pop it.</v>

187
00:05:33.141 --> 00:05:33.870
<v Speaker 2>But I am.</v>

188
00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:36.190
<v Speaker 2>What would you have done if a guy lost an eye though?</v>

189
00:05:36.191 --> 00:05:37.210
<v Speaker 2>Would you have done it?</v>

190
00:05:37.211 --> 00:05:38.120
<v Speaker 2>Would we'd pick it up?</v>

191
00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:42.020
<v Speaker 1>It was fun until it wasn't.</v>

192
00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:43.500
<v Speaker 1>And you.</v>

193
00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:43.791
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

194
00:05:43.791 --> 00:05:44.061
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

195
00:05:44.061 --> 00:05:45.260
<v Speaker 1>the story we were,</v>

196
00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:48.170
<v Speaker 1>we had backed off that marketing and where,</v>

197
00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:48.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

198
00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:49.870
<v Speaker 1>the unified rules,</v>

199
00:05:49.871 --> 00:05:50.111
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

200
00:05:50.111 --> 00:05:52.040
<v Speaker 1>were coming into place and you know,</v>

201
00:05:52.041 --> 00:05:52.874
<v Speaker 1>it was</v>

202
00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:55.150
<v Speaker 2>well for a lot of folks who don't know what we're talking about.</v>

203
00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:56.860
<v Speaker 2>When the UFC first came out,</v>

204
00:05:56.861 --> 00:05:58.160
<v Speaker 2>there were no way classes</v>

205
00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.290
<v Speaker 1>and there were no rules and you could not,</v>

206
00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:00.861
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

207
00:06:00.861 --> 00:06:02.660
<v Speaker 1>the fighter could tap,</v>

208
00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:03.150
<v Speaker 1>they could,</v>

209
00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:06.790
<v Speaker 1>but no one could throw in the towel and the referee couldn't stop the flood.</v>

210
00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.110
<v Speaker 1>That was on one at changed by two.</v>

211
00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:10.160
<v Speaker 1>That was insane.</v>

212
00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:10.790
<v Speaker 1>But anyway,</v>

213
00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:11.150
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

214
00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:11.970
<v Speaker 1>that was insane.</v>

215
00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:14.000
<v Speaker 1>So what is this sort of highlights it.</v>

216
00:06:14.001 --> 00:06:16.250
<v Speaker 1>So that's the first episode,</v>

217
00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:17.300
<v Speaker 1>the first UFC,</v>

218
00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:18.470
<v Speaker 1>and then from there,</v>

219
00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:22.310
<v Speaker 1>slowly but surely rule start becoming implemented strategies,</v>

220
00:06:22.311 --> 00:06:23.540
<v Speaker 1>change rounds,</v>

221
00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:25.340
<v Speaker 1>weight classes,</v>

222
00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:26.030
<v Speaker 1>gloves.</v>

223
00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:27.170
<v Speaker 1>Things got really interesting,</v>

224
00:06:27.171 --> 00:06:29.750
<v Speaker 1>really fast and I'll think a lot of people were unaware of it.</v>

225
00:06:29.751 --> 00:06:32.660
<v Speaker 1>If you think about the difference between 93 and 97,</v>

226
00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:37.010
<v Speaker 1>I came in in [inaudible] 97 when Vito made his debut gloves.</v>

227
00:06:37.011 --> 00:06:38.180
<v Speaker 1>We're still not mandatory.</v>

228
00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:39.680
<v Speaker 1>They were optional.</v>

229
00:06:39.681 --> 00:06:41.150
<v Speaker 1>Some fighters fought without gloves,</v>

230
00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:45.620
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't that the case was against gloves.</v>

231
00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:47.360
<v Speaker 1>After I saw tank knockout,</v>

232
00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:48.261
<v Speaker 1>what's his name?</v>

233
00:06:48.261 --> 00:06:49.094
<v Speaker 1>Man to a</v>

234
00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:51.830
<v Speaker 1>tank was smart.</v>

235
00:06:51.831 --> 00:06:53.840
<v Speaker 1>He figured out he goes gloves or a weapon.</v>

236
00:06:53.841 --> 00:06:54.674
<v Speaker 1>I'm bringing them.</v>

237
00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:54.931
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

238
00:06:54.931 --> 00:06:56.910
<v Speaker 2>You get getting your nutrition from your diet.</v>

239
00:06:56.911 --> 00:06:57.031
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

240
00:06:57.031 --> 00:06:57.900
<v Speaker 2>that would be ideal,</v>

241
00:06:57.901 --> 00:07:01.560
<v Speaker 2>but the reality is we have the National Institute of Medicine that we're</v>

242
00:07:01.561 --> 00:07:03.630
<v Speaker 2>conducting these surveys every five years.</v>

243
00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:05.370
<v Speaker 2>They call them the nutrition.</v>

244
00:07:05.371 --> 00:07:07.470
<v Speaker 2>In examination health surveys and hanes.</v>

245
00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:10.690
<v Speaker 2>It's very notorious in the nutrition field there.</v>

246
00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:15.690
<v Speaker 2>We consider n hanes surveys to be pretty accurate in determining what people are</v>

247
00:07:15.691 --> 00:07:17.570
<v Speaker 2>getting from their diet and you know,</v>

248
00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:19.170
<v Speaker 2>these surveys are telling us no,</v>

249
00:07:19.171 --> 00:07:21.630
<v Speaker 2>people are not getting what they need from their diet.</v>

250
00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:24.660
<v Speaker 2>The majority of Americans are not getting what they need in terms of</v>

251
00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:26.670
<v Speaker 2>micronutrients.</v>

252
00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:27.091
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

253
00:07:27.091 --> 00:07:32.091
<v Speaker 1>it's really hard to do so and to do so on a daily basis requires you to really</v>

254
00:07:32.311 --> 00:07:33.480
<v Speaker 1>eat clean and healthy.</v>

255
00:07:33.481 --> 00:07:36.030
<v Speaker 1>Mean you can get what you need from your diet,</v>

256
00:07:36.031 --> 00:07:36.511
<v Speaker 1>but boy,</v>

257
00:07:36.511 --> 00:07:39.330
<v Speaker 1>you have to really mind what you're eating.</v>

258
00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:41.750
<v Speaker 2>You have to really work at it and it's.</v>

259
00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:41.971
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

260
00:07:41.971 --> 00:07:42.870
<v Speaker 2>it's a lot of effort</v>

261
00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:49.780
<v Speaker 1>and there's also the difference between the idea of you just surviving and not</v>

262
00:07:49.781 --> 00:07:52.570
<v Speaker 1>getting a disease and you being at optimal health.</v>

263
00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:53.630
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely,</v>

264
00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:54.171
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

265
00:07:54.171 --> 00:07:55.880
<v Speaker 2>That's something that our lab works on.</v>

266
00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:57.680
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

267
00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:02.680
<v Speaker 2>where we've got this sort of theory that it's hard to do aging studies in people</v>

268
00:08:04.371 --> 00:08:08.000
<v Speaker 2>and particularly looking at different vitamins and minerals and what effects</v>

269
00:08:08.001 --> 00:08:09.050
<v Speaker 2>they have longterm.</v>

270
00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:11.150
<v Speaker 2>But that's,</v>

271
00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:16.180
<v Speaker 2>that's one of the theories in our lab that we've shown some evidence of it is</v>

272
00:08:17.301 --> 00:08:17.830
<v Speaker 2>that you know the,</v>

273
00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:19.930
<v Speaker 2>a lot of vitamins and minerals there,</v>

274
00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:24.680
<v Speaker 2>their cofactors for many different biochemical pathways in your body.</v>

275
00:08:24.681 --> 00:08:28.070
<v Speaker 2>Like if you were just gonna go buy a biochemical pathways.</v>

276
00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:32.750
<v Speaker 2>You'll see this like massive image come up and it's just like holy crap.</v>

277
00:08:32.751 --> 00:08:35.990
<v Speaker 2>Like and vitamins and minerals are cofactors for enzymes.</v>

278
00:08:35.991 --> 00:08:40.991
<v Speaker 2>Meaning they need to be there for the enzyme to work optimally in enzymes and</v>

279
00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:43.610
<v Speaker 2>proteins in your body are doing everything.</v>

280
00:08:43.611 --> 00:08:46.490
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's what's right and what's doing everything our is doing.</v>

281
00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:48.740
<v Speaker 2>And so if you don't have,</v>

282
00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:48.981
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

283
00:08:48.981 --> 00:08:51.560
<v Speaker 2>there's certain proteins that are important to survive right now,</v>

284
00:08:51.561 --> 00:08:53.870
<v Speaker 2>like your sodium potassium atpase,</v>

285
00:08:53.871 --> 00:08:54.051
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

286
00:08:54.051 --> 00:08:56.370
<v Speaker 2>you want to make sure your heart's getting the right signals you want.</v>

287
00:08:56.371 --> 00:08:56.910
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

288
00:08:56.910 --> 00:08:57.691
<v Speaker 2>if that shuts down,</v>

289
00:08:57.691 --> 00:08:58.524
<v Speaker 2>then you're dead.</v>

290
00:08:58.560 --> 00:08:59.060
<v Speaker 2>You know.</v>

291
00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:00.270
<v Speaker 2>So I mean some of these,</v>

292
00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:02.340
<v Speaker 2>some of these functions are not.</v>

293
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:03.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

294
00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:05.730
<v Speaker 2>So that's the biochemical pathways I'm talking about.</v>

295
00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:06.691
<v Speaker 2>So these,</v>

296
00:09:06.691 --> 00:09:08.310
<v Speaker 2>and that's just a snapshot,</v>

297
00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:09.660
<v Speaker 2>that's just a snapshot.</v>

298
00:09:09.661 --> 00:09:11.610
<v Speaker 2>So I mean all these different pathways,</v>

299
00:09:11.611 --> 00:09:14.190
<v Speaker 2>they require vitamins and minerals,</v>

300
00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:15.960
<v Speaker 2>essential fatty acids.</v>

301
00:09:15.961 --> 00:09:17.340
<v Speaker 2>I mean these things,</v>

302
00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:18.810
<v Speaker 2>it's complicated.</v>

303
00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:21.630
<v Speaker 2>And so cheeseburgers don't,</v>

304
00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:24.150
<v Speaker 2>don't give that everything it needs.</v>

305
00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:25.501
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

306
00:09:25.501 --> 00:09:26.334
<v Speaker 2>they don't,</v>

307
00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:27.463
<v Speaker 2>they don't,</v>

308
00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:28.040
<v Speaker 2>they don't.</v>
