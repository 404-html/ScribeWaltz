<v Speaker 1>How did he come into the fold?</v>

9
00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.690
<v Speaker 2>I met Joey Diaz in the late nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

10
00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:24.430
<v Speaker 2>at the comedy store.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I met him in [inaudible] 96 or</v>

11
00:00:24.431 --> 00:00:25.780
<v Speaker 2>97,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

12
00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.570
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right when Joey moved to La.</v>

13
00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.330
<v Speaker 2>We just started hanging around the</v>
<v Speaker 2>comedy store when we became friends and</v>

14
00:00:31.331 --> 00:00:34.240
<v Speaker 2>then I started taking on the road with</v>
<v Speaker 2>me like,</v>

15
00:00:34.241 --> 00:00:35.740
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the late nineties.</v>

16
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.930
<v Speaker 2>We've been best friends forever,</v>

17
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.360
<v Speaker 1>so I know of Joey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know Joey.</v>

18
00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.300
<v Speaker 1>I've never met him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never met Joe.</v>

19
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.830
<v Speaker 1>Never.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I call him up right now.</v>

20
00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:46.790
<v Speaker 1>TV and the whole bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

21
00:00:46.791 --> 00:00:49.230
<v Speaker 1>I know him from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from you and I see your podcasts and all</v>

22
00:00:49.231 --> 00:00:49.670
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>

23
00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:51.580
<v Speaker 1>And he's in the circles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He does some Jujitsu.</v>

24
00:00:51.581 --> 00:00:53.720
<v Speaker 1>He's funnier than hell and he's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>gangster.</v>

25
00:00:53.721 --> 00:00:55.640
<v Speaker 1>So I liked him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know anything about him.</v>

26
00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.880
<v Speaker 1>So he comes on my podcast now he has a</v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast.</v>

27
00:00:58.881 --> 00:01:00.710
<v Speaker 1>So of course my opening line to them is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

28
00:01:00.711 --> 00:01:01.670
<v Speaker 1>how'd you get into pocket?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

29
00:01:01.671 --> 00:01:04.280
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to put here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's your plug for your podcast and</v>

30
00:01:04.281 --> 00:01:05.780
<v Speaker 1>we're going to go on and talk about my</v>
<v Speaker 1>agenda.</v>

31
00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:07.520
<v Speaker 1>So I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>

32
00:01:07.521 --> 00:01:09.260
<v Speaker 1>I say to him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joey,</v>

33
00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:11.900
<v Speaker 1>how'd you get into podcasting?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And his response,</v>

34
00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.750
<v Speaker 1>you know Chael Sonnen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wouldn't call me jail.</v>

35
00:01:14.751 --> 00:01:17.330
<v Speaker 1>It was always.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She still calls me Joe Rogan.</v>

36
00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm mugged a hooker down in New Jersey</v>
<v Speaker 1>and senator Lee set her wig on fire.</v>

37
00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:25.370
<v Speaker 1>It's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got to.</v>

38
00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.110
<v Speaker 1>There's two moving parts here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First off,</v>

39
00:01:27.111 --> 00:01:28.970
<v Speaker 1>that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how that answers my</v>

40
00:01:28.971 --> 00:01:32.420
<v Speaker 1>question of how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now I need to know the story here.</v>

41
00:01:32.421 --> 00:01:36.080
<v Speaker 1>So we ties it all together with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He went on something,</v>

42
00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:37.760
<v Speaker 1>just something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got an appearance.</v>

43
00:01:37.761 --> 00:01:40.460
<v Speaker 1>He told the story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a mug and a hooker in New Jersey and</v>

44
00:01:40.461 --> 00:01:43.670
<v Speaker 1>setting her wig on fire and all of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sudden he blew up overnight and he goes,</v>

45
00:01:43.671 --> 00:01:45.080
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I realized people like the stores,</v>

46
00:01:45.081 --> 00:01:48.620
<v Speaker 1>I never knew that I had stories from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the country I'm in and the</v>

47
00:01:48.621 --> 00:01:50.900
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood I grew up in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought everybody had these doors.</v>

48
00:01:50.901 --> 00:01:51.531
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chill center,</v>

49
00:01:51.531 --> 00:01:54.020
<v Speaker 1>and I thought I'd tell you I mogul</v>
<v Speaker 1>hooker and lighter wig on fire.</v>

50
00:01:54.021 --> 00:01:54.471
<v Speaker 1>You Go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

51
00:01:54.471 --> 00:01:56.900
<v Speaker 1>well I'm a 10 hookers and let 10 wigs on</v>
<v Speaker 1>fire.</v>

52
00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.570
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know I had stories and then it</v>

53
00:01:59.571 --> 00:02:02.800
<v Speaker 1>just goes from there and he starts</v>
<v Speaker 1>telling me about sa Sa.</v>

54
00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.510
<v Speaker 1>So he ends up doing two years or 18</v>
<v Speaker 1>months.</v>

55
00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:06.260
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

56
00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.150
<v Speaker 1>what kind of jam did you get in there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

57
00:02:08.151 --> 00:02:09.260
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was actually,</v>

58
00:02:09.261 --> 00:02:10.820
<v Speaker 1>I was doing the cop's job for them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

59
00:02:10.821 --> 00:02:12.260
<v Speaker 1>the cops don't want drugs on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>streets.</v>

60
00:02:12.261 --> 00:02:14.600
<v Speaker 1>I went and took two kilos off the</v>
<v Speaker 1>streets for them.</v>

61
00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.360
<v Speaker 1>This is how he presents it to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

62
00:02:17.361 --> 00:02:17.841
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

63
00:02:17.841 --> 00:02:20.540
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the two kilos wasn't as big of a deal.</v>

64
00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:21.440
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

65
00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:22.041
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

66
00:02:22.041 --> 00:02:23.720
<v Speaker 1>I robbed two kilos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

67
00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.180
<v Speaker 1>and you know what else?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chael Sonnen.</v>

68
00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.600
<v Speaker 1>I just happened to have a machine gun</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I go,</v>

69
00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.370
<v Speaker 1>I can see where that happened because</v>
<v Speaker 1>she is sometimes you just back into a</v>

70
00:02:31.371 --> 00:02:33.620
<v Speaker 1>machine gun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a machine gun with me and he goes,</v>

71
00:02:33.621 --> 00:02:35.600
<v Speaker 1>but it's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't in trouble for the gun.</v>

72
00:02:35.601 --> 00:02:38.090
<v Speaker 1>I really wasn't in that much trouble for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the drugs.</v>

73
00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.160
<v Speaker 1>What they were upset about was the</v>
<v Speaker 1>kidnapping.</v>

74
00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:41.211
<v Speaker 1>I'm going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

75
00:02:41.211 --> 00:02:42.800
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happened?</v>

76
00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.630
<v Speaker 1>This is my intro to the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

77
00:02:44.631 --> 00:02:46.310
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What in the hell is this story?</v>

78
00:02:46.311 --> 00:02:47.780
<v Speaker 1>You probably know the story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I did it.</v>

79
00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:49.940
<v Speaker 1>So he tells me the whole story and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>

80
00:02:49.941 --> 00:02:50.451
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

81
00:02:50.451 --> 00:02:51.950
<v Speaker 1>kidnappings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of a weird charge.</v>

82
00:02:51.951 --> 00:02:53.220
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you invade Italy,</v>

83
00:02:53.221 --> 00:02:54.680
<v Speaker 1>gotten that scuffle in the ultimate</v>
<v Speaker 1>fighter.</v>

84
00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.190
<v Speaker 1>If I come and grab you and take you into</v>
<v Speaker 1>the next room just to cool you down,</v>

85
00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:01.480
<v Speaker 1>taking into a room against your will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's kidnapping.</v>

86
00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.940
<v Speaker 1>So I think like they got them on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>technicality jam,</v>

87
00:03:03.941 --> 00:03:06.220
<v Speaker 1>like what they're doing with Frank Mir.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of these guys were talking about</v>

88
00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:07.570
<v Speaker 1>and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

89
00:03:07.571 --> 00:03:08.770
<v Speaker 1>is that what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

90
00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.200
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I duct taped the games in my trunk and</v>

91
00:03:11.201 --> 00:03:13.290
<v Speaker 1>then I held him in the house for a week</v>
<v Speaker 1>before I let him go.</v>

92
00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.250
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the why didn't you tell me?</v>

93
00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:20.440
<v Speaker 1>Why did you bring up the initial example</v>
<v Speaker 1>of taking me next door and cooling me</v>

94
00:03:20.441 --> 00:03:21.820
<v Speaker 1>debt?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What that have to do?</v>

95
00:03:21.821 --> 00:03:25.690
<v Speaker 1>I still don't know because he's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very kangaroo looking.</v>

96
00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To kangaroos.</v>

97
00:03:27.731 --> 00:03:31.060
<v Speaker 1>Scare the fuck out of me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now all the sudden they started getting</v>

98
00:03:31.061 --> 00:03:35.770
<v Speaker 1>jacked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You saw a lot of that when I was a kid</v>

99
00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.590
<v Speaker 1>when I was a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think they lift?</v>

100
00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:39.453
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they definitely.</v>

101
00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:43.810
<v Speaker 1>They looked like they were fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>school teachers.</v>

102
00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.320
<v Speaker 1>Like they were newspaper reporters or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

103

<v Speaker 1>I want to come in.</v>

106
00:03:54.791 --> 00:03:58.720
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen that video yet?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They wouldn't let a man knocking on the</v>

107
00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:00.460
<v Speaker 1>door.</v>

<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

131
00:04:57.311 --> 00:05:01.720
<v Speaker 1>around last week is a kangaroo seeing</v>
<v Speaker 1>its reflection in somebody's window and</v>

132
00:05:01.721 --> 00:05:03.220
<v Speaker 1>it's trying to fight it so.</v>

133
00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:06.420
<v Speaker 1>But the guys on the other side with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>camera and it's just as jacked like</v>

134
00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:07.780
<v Speaker 1>kangaroo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like punching the window.</v>

135
00:05:07.781 --> 00:05:09.220
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's scary.</v>

136
00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:11.770
<v Speaker 1>Well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the coolest video that came</v>

137
00:05:11.771 --> 00:05:13.540
<v Speaker 1>out last week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you just type in a kangaroo,</v>

138
00:05:13.541 --> 00:05:15.850
<v Speaker 1>a window fist fighting himself in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>window,</v>

139
00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:19.780
<v Speaker 1>shadowboxing a window.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a weird animal.</v>

140
00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:21.580
<v Speaker 1>I love them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they're great,</v>

141
00:05:21.581 --> 00:05:25.570
<v Speaker 1>but it's so weird what it does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the way it acts that sits on its</v>

142
00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:26.890
<v Speaker 1>tail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we.</v>

143
00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:30.070
<v Speaker 1>It's bouncing around these legs and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's got those jacks.</v>

144
00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:32.350
<v Speaker 1>Upper Body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were.</v>

145
00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:34.120
<v Speaker 1>There was like a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get spooked.</v>

146
00:05:34.121 --> 00:05:37.450
<v Speaker 1>Easy to like this one big one was trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have sex.</v>

147
00:05:37.451 --> 00:05:39.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to say it wasn't sex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was definitely rape,</v>

148
00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:42.820
<v Speaker 1>but it was like he was pulling her back</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she was trying to get away,</v>

149
00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:46.450
<v Speaker 1>but there was a reason she was trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get away because there was like a weird</v>

150
00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:47.800
<v Speaker 1>wind come that want to keen.</v>

151
00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:50.200
<v Speaker 1>They all scattered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then they went under the tree and then</v>

152
00:05:50.201 --> 00:05:51.670
<v Speaker 1>they got into it and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

153
00:05:51.671 --> 00:05:55.900
<v Speaker 1>maybe she just wanted some privacy or.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was really interesting how they had</v>

154
00:05:55.901 --> 00:05:58.790
<v Speaker 1>to sneak out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she was scared and then as soon as</v>

155
00:05:58.791 --> 00:06:00.620
<v Speaker 1>this weird thing came,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like a wind.</v>

156
00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:04.280
<v Speaker 1>They all went scattered and then they</v>
<v Speaker 1>got back into.</v>

157
00:06:04.281 --> 00:06:06.830
<v Speaker 1>It was exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked Kanga.</v>

158
00:06:06.831 --> 00:06:08.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is.</v>

159
00:06:08.121 --> 00:06:10.190
<v Speaker 1>It is scary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

160
00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:13.250
<v Speaker 1>knock on the door.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That one's not too jacked.</v>

161
00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.320
<v Speaker 1>Boy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's creepy though.</v>

162
00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:18.210
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

163
00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:19.840
<v Speaker 1>It says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he starts getting pissed.</v>

164
00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:23.210
<v Speaker 1>You scratched my window.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Small window.</v>

165
00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:29.440
<v Speaker 1>This is the right video or maybe</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mirror.</v>

166
00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:34.160
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's thrown himself at the window.</v>

167
00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:37.730
<v Speaker 1>Fuck man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's trying to test themselves.</v>

168
00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:40.120
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>

169
00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:44.840
<v Speaker 1>He's trying to fight what he sees as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>reflection in the window.</v>

170
00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:46.100
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

171
00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.470
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
