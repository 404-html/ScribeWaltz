12
00:00:24.431 --> 00:00:25.780
<v Speaker 2>97,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

13
00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.540
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right when Joey moved to La,</v>

14
00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:30.160
<v Speaker 2>we just started hanging around the</v>
<v Speaker 2>comedy store.</v>

15
00:00:30.161 --> 00:00:31.870
<v Speaker 2>We became friends and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

16
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.220
<v Speaker 2>I started taking him on the road with</v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

17
00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:34.810
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

18
00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.930
<v Speaker 2>the late nineties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've been best friends forever,</v>

19
00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.330
<v Speaker 1>so I know of Joey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know Joey.</v>

20
00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.280
<v Speaker 1>I've never met him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never met Joe.</v>

21

<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

23

<v Speaker 1>He's funnier than hell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's a gangster.</v>

27
00:00:53.721 --> 00:00:55.640
<v Speaker 1>So I like him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know anything about him.</v>

35
00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:11.930

<v Speaker 1>And his response,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chill.</v>

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.330
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chill still calls me Joe Rogan.</v>

39
00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm mugged a hooker down in New Jersey</v>
<v Speaker 1>and senator Lee set her wig on fire.</v>

40
00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.921
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

41
00:01:24.921 --> 00:01:26.570
<v Speaker 1>we got two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's two moving parts here.</v>

42
00:01:26.571 --> 00:01:27.410
<v Speaker 1>First off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is,</v>

43
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.960
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how that answers my</v>
<v Speaker 1>question of how,</v>

44
00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.070
<v Speaker 1>but now I need to know the story here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we ties it all together with,</v>

45
00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:36.980
<v Speaker 1>he went on something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just something,</v>

46
00:01:36.981 --> 00:01:39.270
<v Speaker 1>he got an appearance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He told the story of mugging her,</v>

47
00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.510
<v Speaker 1>a hooker in New Jersey and setting her</v>
<v Speaker 1>wig on fire.</v>

48
00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:43.670
<v Speaker 1>And all of a sudden he blew up overnight</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he goes,</v>

49
00:01:43.671 --> 00:01:45.080
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I realized people like the stores.</v>

50
00:01:45.081 --> 00:01:48.620
<v Speaker 1>I never knew that I had stories from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the country I'm in and the</v>

51
00:01:48.621 --> 00:01:50.870
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood I grew up in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought everybody had these stories.</v>

52
00:01:50.871 --> 00:01:51.561
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chill center.</v>

53
00:01:51.561 --> 00:01:54.020
<v Speaker 1>And I thought I'd tell you I Mugu Hooker</v>
<v Speaker 1>and light her wig on fire.</v>

54
00:01:54.021 --> 00:01:54.471
<v Speaker 1>You Go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>well I'm up 10 hookers and let 10 wigs</v>
<v Speaker 1>on fire.</v>

56
00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.670
<v Speaker 1>It's like I didn't know I had stories.</v>

57
00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.440
<v Speaker 1>And then it just goes from there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he starts telling me about so,</v>

58
00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.180
<v Speaker 1>so he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he ends up doing two years or 18</v>

59
00:02:05.181 --> 00:02:06.020
<v Speaker 1>months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

60
00:02:06.021 --> 00:02:07.790
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what kind of jam did you get in there?</v>

61
00:02:07.791 --> 00:02:08.624
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

62
00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.670
<v Speaker 1>I was actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was doing the cop's job for him.</v>

63
00:02:10.671 --> 00:02:11.930
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cops don't want drugs on the</v>

64
00:02:11.931 --> 00:02:13.850
<v Speaker 1>streets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went and took two kilos off the</v>

65
00:02:13.851 --> 00:02:17.050
<v Speaker 1>streets for him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is how he presents it to me.</v>

66
00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.601
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

67
00:02:17.601 --> 00:02:20.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the two kilos wasn't as big of a deal.</v>

68
00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.440
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

69
00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.330
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I robbed two kilos.</v>

70
00:02:23.331 --> 00:02:24.830
<v Speaker 1>He goes and you know what else?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chill.</v>

71
00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.200
<v Speaker 1>Sudden I just happened to have a machine</v>
<v Speaker 1>gun.</v>

72
00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.641
<v Speaker 1>And I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

73
00:02:28.641 --> 00:02:31.370
<v Speaker 1>I can see where that happening because</v>
<v Speaker 1>she has some times you just back into a</v>

74
00:02:31.371 --> 00:02:33.620
<v Speaker 1>machine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a machine gun with me and he goes,</v>

75
00:02:33.621 --> 00:02:35.600
<v Speaker 1>but it's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't in trouble for the gun.</v>

76
00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.090
<v Speaker 1>I really wasn't that much trouble for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the drugs.</v>

77
00:02:38.091 --> 00:02:40.160
<v Speaker 1>What they were upset about was the</v>
<v Speaker 1>kidnapping.</v>

78
00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:41.211
<v Speaker 1>I'm going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

79
00:02:41.211 --> 00:02:42.770
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happened?</v>

80
00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.630
<v Speaker 1>And this is my intro to the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

81
00:02:44.631 --> 00:02:46.310
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What in the hell is this story?</v>

82
00:02:46.311 --> 00:02:47.780
<v Speaker 1>You probably know the story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I did it.</v>

83
00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:49.940
<v Speaker 1>So he tells me the whole story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

84
00:02:49.941 --> 00:02:50.451
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

85
00:02:50.451 --> 00:02:53.450
<v Speaker 1>kidnappings kind of a weird charge</v>
<v Speaker 1>because when you and vandelay gotten</v>

86
00:02:53.451 --> 00:02:56.390
<v Speaker 1>that scuffle in the ultimate fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I come and grab you and I take you</v>

87
00:02:56.391 --> 00:02:58.220
<v Speaker 1>into the next room just to cool you</v>
<v Speaker 1>down,</v>

88
00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:01.480
<v Speaker 1>taking into a room against your will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's kidnapping.</v>

89
00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.940
<v Speaker 1>So I think like they got him on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>technicality jam,</v>

90
00:03:03.941 --> 00:03:06.220
<v Speaker 1>like what they're doing with Frank Mir.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of these guys were talking about</v>

91
00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:07.570
<v Speaker 1>and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

92
00:03:07.571 --> 00:03:08.770
<v Speaker 1>is that what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

93
00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.110
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I duct taped the guy who was in my trunk</v>

94
00:03:11.111 --> 00:03:13.350
<v Speaker 1>and then I held him in the house for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>week before I let them go like,</v>

95
00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.280
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the why didn't you tell me?</v>

96
00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:20.440
<v Speaker 1>Why did you bring up the initial example</v>
<v Speaker 1>of taking me next door and cooling me</v>

97
00:03:20.441 --> 00:03:21.850
<v Speaker 1>debt?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What that have to do?</v>

98
00:03:21.851 --> 00:03:26.851
<v Speaker 1>I still don't know because he's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very kangaroo looking to Kangaroos scare</v>

99
00:03:27.941 --> 00:03:31.060
<v Speaker 1>the fuck out of me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now all of a sudden they started getting</v>

100
00:03:31.061 --> 00:03:34.230
<v Speaker 1>jacks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We saw a lot of that in Australia.</v>

101
00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:35.740
<v Speaker 1>We're in balance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I was a kid,</v>

102
00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.590
<v Speaker 1>when I was a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think they lift?</v>

<v Speaker 1>Real.</v>

125
00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:41.660

<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

<v Speaker 1>approach to beating off is that can't</v>

<v Speaker 1>move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eat.</v>

129
00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:51.830
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no son.</v>

130
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.660
<v Speaker 1>We saw two having sex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

131
00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:59.650
<v Speaker 1>The video though that it's kind of went</v>
<v Speaker 1>around last week is a kangaroo sing its</v>

132
00:04:59.651 --> 00:05:02.740
<v Speaker 1>reflection in somebody's window and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to fight it.</v>

133
00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:04.510
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the guys on the other side with the</v>

134
00:05:04.511 --> 00:05:06.790
<v Speaker 1>camera and it's just as jacked like</v>
<v Speaker 1>kangaroo,</v>

135
00:05:06.791 --> 00:05:09.220
<v Speaker 1>like punching the window.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's scary.</v>

136
00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:10.570
<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

137
00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:12.160
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the coolest video that came</v>
<v Speaker 1>out last week.</v>

138
00:05:12.161 --> 00:05:14.350
<v Speaker 1>If you just type in a kangaroo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a window,</v>

139
00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:17.350
<v Speaker 1>this fighting himself in a window,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shadowboxing,</v>

140
00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:19.780
<v Speaker 1>a window.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a weird animal.</v>

141
00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:21.550
<v Speaker 1>I love them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they're great,</v>

142
00:05:21.551 --> 00:05:25.600
<v Speaker 1>but it's so weird what it does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the way it acts that sits on its</v>

143
00:05:25.601 --> 00:05:27.120
<v Speaker 1>tail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We spend,</v>

144
00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:30.070
<v Speaker 1>it's bouncing around these legs and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's got those jacks,</v>

145
00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:32.350
<v Speaker 1>upper body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were,</v>

146
00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:34.120
<v Speaker 1>there was like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get spooked.</v>

147
00:05:34.121 --> 00:05:37.450
<v Speaker 1>Easy to like this one big one was trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have sex.</v>

148
00:05:37.451 --> 00:05:39.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to say it wasn't sex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was definitely rape,</v>

149
00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:42.820
<v Speaker 1>but it was like he was pulling her back</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she was trying to get away,</v>

150
00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:46.480
<v Speaker 1>but there was a reason she was trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get away because there was like a weird</v>

151
00:05:46.481 --> 00:05:46.960
<v Speaker 1>wing come.</v>

152
00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.910
<v Speaker 1>They want to keen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They all scattered.</v>

153
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.370
<v Speaker 1>Then they went under the tree and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>they got into it and I was like,</v>

154
00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.290
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe she just wanted some privacy or,</v>

155
00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:56.620
<v Speaker 1>that was really interesting how they had</v>
<v Speaker 1>to sneak out.</v>

156
00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:59.570
<v Speaker 1>But she was scared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then as soon as this weird thing</v>

157
00:05:59.571 --> 00:06:00.620
<v Speaker 1>came,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like a wind.</v>

158
00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:04.310
<v Speaker 1>They all went scattered and then they</v>
<v Speaker 1>got back into,</v>

159
00:06:04.311 --> 00:06:06.830
<v Speaker 1>it was exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked Kanga.</v>

160
00:06:06.831 --> 00:06:08.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is it.</v>

161
00:06:08.271 --> 00:06:10.150
<v Speaker 1>This is so scary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

162
00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:13.250
<v Speaker 1>so it's you knock on the door.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That one's not too jacked.</v>

163
00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:14.540
<v Speaker 1>Boy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boy,</v>

164
00:06:14.541 --> 00:06:16.010
<v Speaker 1>it's creepy though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You haven't looked at it.</v>

165
00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:17.960
<v Speaker 1>All.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My God,</v>

166
00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:21.350
<v Speaker 1>watch this and he starts getting pissed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You scratched my window.</v>

167
00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:26.060
<v Speaker 1>Can you scratch my window?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is not the right video.</v>

168
00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:27.270
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>

169
00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:28.370
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

170
00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:32.150
<v Speaker 1>he's the mirror.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

171
00:06:32.151 --> 00:06:36.230
<v Speaker 1>He's throwing himself at the window.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck man.</v>

172
00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:38.300
<v Speaker 1>He's trying to chess by himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>

173
00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:40.190
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>

174
00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:44.840
<v Speaker 1>He's trying to fight what he sees as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>reflection in the window.</v>

175
00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:46.143
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>

176
00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:55.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
