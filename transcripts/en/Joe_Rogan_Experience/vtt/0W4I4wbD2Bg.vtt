<v Speaker 1>Good googly Mowgli,</v>

2
00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:05.190
<v Speaker 1>ladies and gentlemen.</v>

3
00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:05.731
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

4
00:00:05.731 --> 00:00:09.930
<v Speaker 1>this episode of the podcast is brought to you by untuckit.com this is a new</v>

5
00:00:09.931 --> 00:00:13.140
<v Speaker 1>sponsor and it's a new sponsor has come up with a novel idea.</v>

6
00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.690
<v Speaker 1>Everybody likes wearing those button up shirts.</v>

7
00:00:15.691 --> 00:00:18.120
<v Speaker 1>Like I was wearing a flannel shirt earlier today.</v>

8
00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:19.440
<v Speaker 1>Everybody likes wearing them,</v>

9
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.900
<v Speaker 1>but if you don't tuck them in,</v>

10
00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.580
<v Speaker 1>they look kind of odd,</v>

11
00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:24.181
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

12
00:00:24.181 --> 00:00:27.150
<v Speaker 1>There's like this little blanket that goes over your Dick and your butt.</v>

13
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.530
<v Speaker 1>It's like a backwards hill.</v>

14
00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:29.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

15
00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.860
<v Speaker 1>Like the idea is that you're moving around a lot,</v>

16
00:00:31.861 --> 00:00:32.611
<v Speaker 1>so when you talk it,</v>

17
00:00:32.611 --> 00:00:33.600
<v Speaker 1>it keeps it from untied.</v>

18
00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:35.100
<v Speaker 1>But who the fuck talks their shirt in?</v>

19
00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.640
<v Speaker 1>Especially if you don't have a job where you have to Tuck your shirt in and like</v>

20
00:00:38.641 --> 00:00:39.630
<v Speaker 1>if you're a banker,</v>

21
00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.580
<v Speaker 1>he can't be wandering around what your shirt untucked.</v>

22
00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:43.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to trust you with my cash,</v>

23
00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:45.660
<v Speaker 1>but you don't even remember the last time I tuck my shirt in.</v>

24
00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:46.860
<v Speaker 1>I hate it that much.</v>

25
00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:47.061
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

26
00:00:47.061 --> 00:00:47.400
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

27
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:47.791
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

28
00:00:47.791 --> 00:00:51.600
<v Speaker 1>you have a unconditioned unconventional job if you're a dude with a conventional</v>

29
00:00:51.601 --> 00:00:51.961
<v Speaker 1>job.</v>

30
00:00:51.961 --> 00:00:52.630
<v Speaker 1>Like if you,</v>

31
00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:53.010
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

32
00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:53.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

33
00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.540
<v Speaker 1>I thought you were to say body,</v>

34
00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:54.910
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

35
00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:56.010
<v Speaker 1>that's why I don't like the cut.</v>

36
00:00:56.011 --> 00:00:56.401
<v Speaker 1>Tuck it in.</v>

37
00:00:56.401 --> 00:00:58.680
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to look like a fucking grapefruit.</v>

38
00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.770
<v Speaker 1>It's uncomfortable though being tucked.</v>

39
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:01.860
<v Speaker 1>He got you guys,</v>

40
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:02.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

41
00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:02.640
<v Speaker 1>there's no,</v>

42
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:03.330
<v Speaker 1>not much space.</v>

43
00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.600
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing that guys would go guts do when they have their pants tucked</v>

44
00:01:06.601 --> 00:01:09.660
<v Speaker 1>into and the gut is like firm and tight against their pants.</v>

45
00:01:09.661 --> 00:01:10.410
<v Speaker 1>Almost like a,</v>

46
00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:13.650
<v Speaker 1>a bra for their gut when it's tucked in it in.</v>

47
00:01:13.651 --> 00:01:14.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

48
00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.440
<v Speaker 1>The way I,</v>

49
00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:16.220
<v Speaker 1>that shit.</v>

50
00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:16.850
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

51
00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:17.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

52
00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:18.030
<v Speaker 1>It's not a comfortable,</v>

53
00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm much more comfortable with,</v>

54
00:01:19.651 --> 00:01:20.640
<v Speaker 1>with shirts untucked,</v>

55
00:01:20.641 --> 00:01:22.290
<v Speaker 1>but then there was always that extra cloth.</v>

56
00:01:22.291 --> 00:01:25.680
<v Speaker 1>Well this company untuck it decided to figure that out.</v>

57
00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:27.190
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

58
00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.300
<v Speaker 1>it's made exclusively for men who wear their shirts untucked.</v>

59
00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.961
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

60
00:01:30.961 --> 00:01:33.690
<v Speaker 1>know women won't be so excited to wear your clothes either.</v>

61
00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.810
<v Speaker 1>That's another good thing cause one of the reasons why women like it because it</v>

62
00:01:36.811 --> 00:01:41.100
<v Speaker 1>covers they've of JJ and their butt and they can walk around with their legs or</v>

63
00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.450
<v Speaker 1>legs hanging out more skin.</v>

64
00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:43.830
<v Speaker 1>This will definitely show more skin,</v>

65
00:01:43.831 --> 00:01:44.650
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

66
00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:44.870
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

67
00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:46.050
<v Speaker 1>it's going to show your whole vagina.</v>

68
00:01:46.051 --> 00:01:46.651
<v Speaker 1>Let's be honest.</v>

69
00:01:46.651 --> 00:01:46.861
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

70
00:01:46.861 --> 00:01:48.150
<v Speaker 1>look at this guy's penis says,</v>

71
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.170
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy right there.</v>

72
00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.740
<v Speaker 1>So it'd be less likely that chicks will a wear your clothes or if they do wear</v>

73
00:01:54.751 --> 00:01:55.131
<v Speaker 1>their clothes,</v>

74
00:01:55.131 --> 00:01:56.130
<v Speaker 1>they would have to wear underwear.</v>

75
00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.230
<v Speaker 1>I feel like if I saw this guy in the street,</v>

76
00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.020
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't even notice anything different going on.</v>

77
00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:01.801
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

78
00:02:01.801 --> 00:02:02.910
<v Speaker 1>it just blends right in.</v>

79
00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.391
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

80
00:02:03.391 --> 00:02:03.661
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

81
00:02:03.661 --> 00:02:04.170
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

82
00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.120
<v Speaker 1>the brand ambassador is this guy,</v>

83
00:02:06.121 --> 00:02:06.841
<v Speaker 1>Brad Richards,</v>

84
00:02:06.841 --> 00:02:08.490
<v Speaker 1>who's a hockey star and he,</v>

85
00:02:08.491 --> 00:02:08.760
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

86
00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.640
<v Speaker 1>he decided to be a part of the company as well.</v>

87
00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.860
<v Speaker 1>It's because it's a novel and great idea.</v>

88
00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.080
<v Speaker 1>Untuck it has solved the problem,</v>

89

<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>

91
00:02:18.391 --> 00:02:20.040
<v Speaker 1>for men who wear their shirts untucked.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

00:04:42.561 --> 00:04:43.640
<v Speaker 1>Brian uses it.</v>

187
00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:49.220
<v Speaker 2>looking at,</v>

188
00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:51.870
<v Speaker 2>you got seat so you can plug in on the front page there,</v>

189
00:04:51.871 --> 00:04:54.390
<v Speaker 2>you can plug in your Instagram feed.</v>

190
00:04:54.391 --> 00:04:56.100
<v Speaker 2>So that's always fresh content.</v>

191
00:04:56.101 --> 00:04:56.730
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

192
00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:56.910
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

193
00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:59.790
<v Speaker 2>if you're a person like me and the majority of what you do is on youtube or on</v>

194
00:04:59.791 --> 00:05:03.120
<v Speaker 2>social networks and you don't want to constantly be updating a website,</v>

195
00:05:03.121 --> 00:05:05.910
<v Speaker 2>one way to keep it current is to use this Instagram plugin,</v>

196
00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:09.240
<v Speaker 2>which feeds right back to your Instagram feed obviously.</v>

197
00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:12.140
<v Speaker 2>And so gives people a reason to come back and check it out.</v>

198
00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.590
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they don't use Instagram themselves.</v>

199
00:05:13.591 --> 00:05:14.820
<v Speaker 2>They can still see what you're up to.</v>

200
00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:15.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

201
00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:16.140
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

202
00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:16.870
<v Speaker 2>That's awesome.</v>

203
00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:17.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

204
00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:17.490

223
00:05:46.601 --> 00:05:47.770
<v Speaker 2>so I would just try it.</v>

224
00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:48.790
<v Speaker 2>Try it again.</v>

225
00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:50.140
<v Speaker 2>That's a great idea though.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I.</v>

<v Speaker 1>T.</v>

263
00:06:51.501 --> 00:06:54.440
<v Speaker 1>We dosed up Louis the last time he was here and he had a dream that he was</v>

264
00:06:54.441 --> 00:06:57.020
<v Speaker 1>hanging out with Brian Singer basically.</v>

265
00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:00.860
<v Speaker 1>Plus the protein stuff kept me full.</v>

266
00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:01.730
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

267
00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:02.151
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

268
00:07:02.151 --> 00:07:02.541
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

269
00:07:02.541 --> 00:07:03.800
<v Speaker 1>about to start editing a video.</v>

270
00:07:03.801 --> 00:07:07.220
<v Speaker 1>I took a big protein shake and I'm not super healthy or anything like that,</v>

271
00:07:07.221 --> 00:07:09.620
<v Speaker 1>but I stayed full for a long time.</v>

272
00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:10.551
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to get up.</v>

273
00:07:10.551 --> 00:07:11.570
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to snack.</v>

274
00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:12.831
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you,</v>

275
00:07:12.831 --> 00:07:13.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna take this shit seriously.</v>

276
00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:17.180
<v Speaker 1>Like the pro I've had people recently complained about the hem forest.</v>

277
00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:18.350
<v Speaker 1>They don't like the way it tastes,</v>

278
00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:19.011
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

279
00:07:19.011 --> 00:07:19.340
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>

280
00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:20.300
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's subjective.</v>

281
00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:21.200
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

282
00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:21.831
<v Speaker 1>for the record,</v>

283
00:07:21.831 --> 00:07:23.570
<v Speaker 1>I always mixed mine with coconut water.</v>

284
00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:25.160
<v Speaker 1>I love chocolate though.</v>

285
00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:25.951
<v Speaker 1>Chocolate's good.</v>

286
00:07:25.951 --> 00:07:26.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

287
00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:26.751
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

288
00:07:26.751 --> 00:07:28.400
<v Speaker 1>it's also made with Stevia.</v>

289
00:07:28.401 --> 00:07:29.930
<v Speaker 1>So it has very little sugar,</v>

290
00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:35.350
<v Speaker 1>one gram of naturally occurring sugar per serving if you're interested in hemp.</v>

291
00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:40.100
<v Speaker 1>And especially like people said like why is it so expensive are hamp is the best</v>

292
00:07:40.101 --> 00:07:40.730
<v Speaker 1>hemp you can buy.</v>

293
00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:42.860
<v Speaker 1>If you go to any store,</v>

294
00:07:42.861 --> 00:07:46.520
<v Speaker 1>you can buy hemp protein powder and you can compare the two of them between this</v>

295
00:07:46.521 --> 00:07:47.354
<v Speaker 1>and hemp force.</v>

296
00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:48.230
<v Speaker 1>And there's two,</v>

297
00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:49.100
<v Speaker 1>two differences.</v>

298
00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:49.880
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>

299
00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:54.140
<v Speaker 1>the percentage of protein per serving is much higher on the stuff that we buy</v>

300
00:07:54.141 --> 00:07:56.030
<v Speaker 1>and we just bought the best stuff that you can get.</v>

301
00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:57.410
<v Speaker 1>It's not cheap.</v>

302
00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:00.290
<v Speaker 1>We have to buy it from Canada to unfortunately they're starting to change that</v>

303
00:08:00.291 --> 00:08:01.124
<v Speaker 1>law.</v>

304
00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:02.690
<v Speaker 1>They're fighting against it.</v>

305
00:08:02.691 --> 00:08:04.070
<v Speaker 1>They're going all the way to the supreme court.</v>

306
00:08:04.071 --> 00:08:07.460
<v Speaker 1>And in Kentucky there was like some recent website,</v>

307
00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:11.570
<v Speaker 1>there was a detailing Kentucky's battle to uh,</v>

308
00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:13.190
<v Speaker 1>to grow hemp,</v>

309
00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:14.750
<v Speaker 1>which is non psychoactive,</v>

310
00:08:14.751 --> 00:08:15.081
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>

311
00:08:15.081 --> 00:08:16.760
<v Speaker 1>Completely nonsense not getting anybody.</v>

312
00:08:16.761 --> 00:08:17.450
<v Speaker 1>Hi.</v>

313
00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:21.290
<v Speaker 1>It's just connected to from the beginning to marijuana.</v>

314
00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:24.470
<v Speaker 1>And the reason being that marijuana became illegal,</v>

315
00:08:24.471 --> 00:08:26.510
<v Speaker 1>and this is really wacky stuff,</v>

316
00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:28.790
<v Speaker 1>but it was because of hemp hemp,</v>

317
00:08:28.791 --> 00:08:31.850
<v Speaker 1>the commodity hamp being used for paper,</v>

318
00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:35.780
<v Speaker 1>hemp being used for cloth hemp being used for food and for oil.</v>

319
00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:39.860
<v Speaker 1>Henry Ford in fact made the very first fenders of his very first car out of</v>

320
00:08:39.861 --> 00:08:40.460
<v Speaker 1>hemp.</v>

321
00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:41.900
<v Speaker 1>And there's a video online.</v>

322
00:08:41.901 --> 00:08:45.110
<v Speaker 1>If you go to that video that you could see Henry Ford banging on the fender with</v>

323
00:08:45.111 --> 00:08:45.944
<v Speaker 1>a hammer.</v>

324
00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:47.970
<v Speaker 1>Hemp is a crazy plan.</v>

325
00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:49.550
<v Speaker 1>I mean is literally like,</v>

326
00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:50.990
<v Speaker 1>it comes from another planet.</v>

327
00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:52.610
<v Speaker 1>It's so different than anything else.</v>

328
00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:54.290
<v Speaker 1>If you pick up a hemp stalk,</v>

329
00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:55.680
<v Speaker 1>it's light,</v>

330
00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:57.600
<v Speaker 1>but really hard,</v>

331
00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:59.550
<v Speaker 1>like a piece of hemp stalk,</v>

332
00:08:59.551 --> 00:09:00.620
<v Speaker 1>like a big thick of a,</v>

333
00:09:00.621 --> 00:09:03.270
<v Speaker 1>a hemp tree that grew a thick and large.</v>

334
00:09:03.271 --> 00:09:04.740
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing how strong it is.</v>

335
00:09:04.741 --> 00:09:05.341
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>

336
00:09:05.341 --> 00:09:07.080
<v Speaker 1>It's like an alien plant you can eat.</v>

337
00:09:07.081 --> 00:09:09.000
<v Speaker 1>It has all the essential fatty acids.</v>

338
00:09:09.001 --> 00:09:11.040
<v Speaker 1>The protein in it is very,</v>

339
00:09:11.041 --> 00:09:12.480
<v Speaker 1>very digestible.</v>

340
00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:13.380
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

341
00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:15.030
<v Speaker 1>like I said with with on it,</v>

342
00:09:15.031 --> 00:09:17.190
<v Speaker 1>we try to use the best stuff available,</v>

343
00:09:17.191 --> 00:09:20.760
<v Speaker 1>but you can buy hemp force or hemp protein rather.</v>

344
00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:24.720
<v Speaker 1>That's a cheaper variety from many different sources and you can see the</v>

345
00:09:24.721 --> 00:09:25.171
<v Speaker 1>difference.</v>

346
00:09:25.171 --> 00:09:27.540
<v Speaker 1>You can see it and it will be more gritty.</v>

347
00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:28.020
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

348
00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:30.210
<v Speaker 1>it won't digest is easily prob probably,</v>

349
00:09:30.211 --> 00:09:32.550
<v Speaker 1>and it probably won't have as much protein per percentage,</v>

350
00:09:32.551 --> 00:09:33.390
<v Speaker 1>but it's all good.</v>

351
00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:33.841
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

352
00:09:33.841 --> 00:09:34.021
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

353
00:09:34.021 --> 00:09:36.750
<v Speaker 1>any hemp protein is one of the best proteins you can get.</v>

354
00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:37.200
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

355
00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:37.890
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

356
00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:38.370
<v Speaker 1>it hasn't,</v>

357
00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:42.180
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have less issues digesting it then you will way some people have</v>

358
00:09:42.181 --> 00:09:45.290
<v Speaker 1>no problem with way other people are more sensitive.</v>

359
00:09:45.291 --> 00:09:49.410
<v Speaker 1>My wife has waiver had whey protein prior to this one showing up and we were</v>

360
00:09:49.411 --> 00:09:53.400
<v Speaker 1>comparing the nutritional values and something I noticed on the hemp was the</v>

361
00:09:53.401 --> 00:09:54.234
<v Speaker 1>fiber,</v>

362
00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:56.040
<v Speaker 1>the fiber compared to the way,</v>

363
00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:57.300
<v Speaker 1>well it's plant based.</v>

364
00:09:57.540 --> 00:09:59.130
<v Speaker 1>It's like 11 grams or something.</v>

365
00:09:59.131 --> 00:09:59.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

366
00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:00.750
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

367
00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:01.290
<v Speaker 1>I could have,</v>

368
00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:03.760
<v Speaker 1>I could use the help everybody get fiber.</v>

369
00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:05.100
<v Speaker 1>It's just good for your body.</v>

370
00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:06.180
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

371
00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:06.631
<v Speaker 1>anyway,</v>

372
00:10:06.631 --> 00:10:11.631
<v Speaker 1>we carry that in a host of other healthy snacks and foods like the warrior</v>

373
00:10:11.941 --> 00:10:12.900
<v Speaker 1>protein bar,</v>

374
00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:13.801
<v Speaker 1>which is a,</v>

375
00:10:13.801 --> 00:10:13.981
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

376
00:10:13.981 --> 00:10:16.110
<v Speaker 1>a bar that's made out of Buffalo.</v>

377
00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:16.620
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

378
00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:21.480
<v Speaker 1>it's made out of buffalo in this ancient native American tradition that uses</v>

379
00:10:21.481 --> 00:10:24.540
<v Speaker 1>cranberries and pepper with no antibiotics,</v>

380
00:10:24.541 --> 00:10:25.980
<v Speaker 1>no added hormones,</v>

381
00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:27.240
<v Speaker 1>no nitrates,</v>

382
00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:29.220
<v Speaker 1>and a totally gluten free,</v>

383
00:10:29.221 --> 00:10:30.810
<v Speaker 1>although I don't know why he would have gluten.</v>

384
00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:34.740
<v Speaker 1>I guess you could maybe put wheat somehow or another than a bar to make it</v>

385
00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:35.980
<v Speaker 1>anyway.</v>

386
00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:36.600
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

387
00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:38.400
<v Speaker 1>what these bars are,</v>

388
00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:42.840
<v Speaker 1>is essentially just a really healthy protein snack that's totally natural.</v>

389
00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:44.010
<v Speaker 1>Buffalo meat,</v>

390
00:10:44.011 --> 00:10:45.660
<v Speaker 1>14 grams of protein,</v>

391
00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:50.010
<v Speaker 1>and it's based on a recipe that has been in the Lakota Sioux warriors for</v>

392
00:10:50.011 --> 00:10:52.650
<v Speaker 1>century really can't call them Lakota.</v>

393
00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:57.180
<v Speaker 1>Sioux Lakota is what they call themselves.</v>

394
00:10:57.181 --> 00:10:58.490
<v Speaker 1>Sue is with other,</v>

395
00:10:58.500 --> 00:10:59.700
<v Speaker 1>other Indians would call them,</v>

396
00:10:59.701 --> 00:11:00.990
<v Speaker 1>other native Americans would call them.</v>

397
00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:02.940
<v Speaker 1>And Sue means it means enemy.</v>

398
00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:06.390
<v Speaker 1>So calling them Lakota Sioux Warriors,</v>

399
00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:08.370
<v Speaker 1>it's not really the correct verbiage.</v>

400
00:11:08.371 --> 00:11:09.060
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

401
00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:11.550
<v Speaker 1>It's a Lakota people anyway.</v>

402
00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:13.020
<v Speaker 1>The LAKOTA people,</v>

403
00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:14.550
<v Speaker 1>they figured out a way,</v>

404
00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:14.911
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

405
00:11:14.911 --> 00:11:15.181
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>

406
00:11:15.181 --> 00:11:15.391
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>

407
00:11:15.391 --> 00:11:15.631
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>

408
00:11:15.631 --> 00:11:15.931
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>

409
00:11:15.931 --> 00:11:20.640
<v Speaker 1>many years ago to how to preserve meat without a,</v>

410
00:11:20.641 --> 00:11:24.480
<v Speaker 1>all the modern shit that we use that it was probably super bad for you.</v>

411
00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:25.770
<v Speaker 1>So no MSG,</v>

412
00:11:25.771 --> 00:11:26.700
<v Speaker 1>no lactose,</v>

413
00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:28.230
<v Speaker 1>no nitrates as I said,</v>

414
00:11:28.231 --> 00:11:29.730
<v Speaker 1>which is the one thing that people really,</v>

415
00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:30.010
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

416
00:11:30.010 --> 00:11:32.190
<v Speaker 1>are very leery about when it comes to,</v>

417
00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:33.000
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

418
00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:33.300
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

419
00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:34.560
<v Speaker 1>food supplements,</v>

420
00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:35.551
<v Speaker 1>not food supplement,</v>

421
00:11:35.551 --> 00:11:35.761
<v Speaker 1>food,</v>

422
00:11:35.761 --> 00:11:39.300
<v Speaker 1>snacks like a beef jerkys and Salamis and things like that.</v>

423
00:11:39.301 --> 00:11:40.230
<v Speaker 1>Things with nitrates,</v>

424
00:11:40.231 --> 00:11:41.010
<v Speaker 1>hot dogs,</v>

425
00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:41.491
<v Speaker 1>nitrates,</v>

426
00:11:41.491 --> 00:11:42.210
<v Speaker 1>not so good,</v>

427
00:11:42.210 --> 00:11:43.320
<v Speaker 1>no antibiotics as well,</v>

428
00:11:43.321 --> 00:11:44.220
<v Speaker 1>no added hormones,</v>

429
00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:45.510
<v Speaker 1>all just super healthy.</v>

430
00:11:45.511 --> 00:11:45.811
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

431
00:11:45.811 --> 00:11:50.070
<v Speaker 1>14 grams per servings and only 140 calories.</v>

432
00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:52.650
<v Speaker 1>A just one of the many things that we have it on it.</v>

433
00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:53.411
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

434
00:11:53.411 --> 00:11:55.240
<v Speaker 1>and also if you use the codeword Rogan,</v>

435
00:11:55.241 --> 00:11:57.850
<v Speaker 1>you will save 10% off any and all supplements.</v>

436
00:11:57.851 --> 00:11:58.630
<v Speaker 1>Anything else before we get</v>

437
00:11:58.630 --> 00:11:59.020

453
00:12:36.210 --> 00:12:37.043
<v Speaker 1>Let's just do this.</v>

457
00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:48.260
<v Speaker 1>Louis.</v>

458
00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:50.600
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people don't want to think you're on speed when you're on coffee,</v>

459
00:12:50.601 --> 00:12:51.710
<v Speaker 1>but you're aligning yourself.</v>

460
00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:52.400
<v Speaker 1>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>

461
00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:53.900
<v Speaker 1>you're in a mild form of speed.</v>

462
00:12:53.970 --> 00:12:54.531
<v Speaker 1>That's a good point.</v>

463
00:12:54.531 --> 00:12:55.364
<v Speaker 1>Drugs are everywhere.</v>

464
00:12:55.370 --> 00:12:57.560
<v Speaker 1>You don't like a doctor.</v>

465
00:12:57.561 --> 00:12:58.610
<v Speaker 1>Carl Hart said,</v>

466
00:12:58.790 --> 00:13:00.920
<v Speaker 1>you don't want a drug free America.</v>

467
00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:02.900
<v Speaker 1>That's an unproductive Martha,</v>

468
00:13:02.901 --> 00:13:03.130
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

469
00:13:03.130 --> 00:13:04.330
<v Speaker 1>So I'll go with it.</v>

470
00:13:04.331 --> 00:13:05.600
<v Speaker 1>With that coffee away from people.</v>

471
00:13:05.601 --> 00:13:06.590
<v Speaker 1>They're not working anymore.</v>

472
00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:07.281
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing,</v>

473
00:13:07.281 --> 00:13:07.710
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

474
00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:10.160
<v Speaker 1>Remember when you were young and there was no Starbucks,</v>

475
00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:10.950
<v Speaker 1>they didn't exist.</v>

476
00:13:10.950 --> 00:13:14.720
<v Speaker 1>Like this is something like that waiting for us out there.</v>

477
00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:15.441
<v Speaker 1>The zero,</v>

478
00:13:15.441 --> 00:13:17.420
<v Speaker 1>like a new thing that's going to just,</v>

479
00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:18.373
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

480
00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:19.280
<v Speaker 1>that's a good question.</v>

481
00:13:19.281 --> 00:13:21.710
<v Speaker 1>Some substance I was coffee was there forever,</v>

482
00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:22.161
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

483
00:13:22.161 --> 00:13:23.660
<v Speaker 1>Marijuana before.</v>

484
00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:24.171
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

485
00:13:24.171 --> 00:13:24.621
<v Speaker 1>That's probably,</v>

486
00:13:24.621 --> 00:13:25.041
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

487
00:13:25.041 --> 00:13:25.874
<v Speaker 1>it's capital yet.</v>

488
00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:27.200
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that what's happening in Colorado?</v>

489
00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:27.591
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

490
00:13:27.591 --> 00:13:28.580
<v Speaker 1>It's happening like crazy.</v>

491
00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:29.140
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

492
00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:32.060
<v Speaker 1>Carl Rogers going off Washington state's going off now too.</v>

493
00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:33.470
<v Speaker 1>Cause now they just started selling it.</v>

494
00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:35.660
<v Speaker 1>So now the same ripple effect.</v>

495
00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:37.880
<v Speaker 1>The same effect it's happening in Colorado,</v>

496
00:13:37.881 --> 00:13:40.900
<v Speaker 1>which is they're making way more money than they even planned.</v>

497
00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:41.230
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

498
00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:44.210
<v Speaker 1>They had like an idea of how much money they would make and they're making way</v>

499
00:13:44.211 --> 00:13:44.660
<v Speaker 1>more,</v>

500
00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:45.493
<v Speaker 1>way more now.</v>

501
00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:46.520
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

502
00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:48.240
<v Speaker 1>well that's something that has been tied up for,</v>

503
00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:49.370
<v Speaker 1>for too long.</v>

504
00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:49.791
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

505
00:13:49.791 --> 00:13:50.660
<v Speaker 1>It makes a lot of sense.</v>

506
00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:51.550
<v Speaker 1>Fascinating.</v>

507
00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:53.660
<v Speaker 1>What a strange world we live in.</v>

508
00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:54.740
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

509
00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:55.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean now they have a,</v>

510
00:13:56.090 --> 00:13:58.100
<v Speaker 1>have you seen the pot coin?</v>

511
00:13:58.550 --> 00:14:01.870
<v Speaker 1>It is a digital currency based on marijuana.</v>

512
00:14:01.871 --> 00:14:03.560
<v Speaker 1>I get inevitable.</v>

513
00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:07.400
<v Speaker 1>You gotta be able to buy marijuana with his digital currency.</v>

514
00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:09.260
<v Speaker 1>I think you need your own currency next.</v>

515
00:14:09.490 --> 00:14:11.120
<v Speaker 1>That's when that's when the government comes after you.</v>

516
00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:12.290
<v Speaker 1>You got to stay low.</v>

517
00:14:12.291 --> 00:14:13.550
<v Speaker 1>Jre Coin,</v>

518
00:14:13.610 --> 00:14:16.500
<v Speaker 1>you got to stay free and the unambitious that's true.</v>

519
00:14:16.850 --> 00:14:17.271
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

520
00:14:17.271 --> 00:14:18.320
<v Speaker 1>Running for office,</v>

521
00:14:18.530 --> 00:14:18.771
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

522
00:14:18.771 --> 00:14:18.981
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

523
00:14:18.981 --> 00:14:20.150
<v Speaker 1>trying to affect policy.</v>

524
00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:21.320
<v Speaker 1>Nothing crazy.</v>

525
00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:23.780
<v Speaker 1>But maybe coins can become that seriously.</v>

526
00:14:23.781 --> 00:14:28.781
<v Speaker 1>Like where communities online could have a coin almost as a reward system for</v>

527
00:14:29.211 --> 00:14:31.460
<v Speaker 1>the best participants within that community.</v>

528
00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:31.911
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

529
00:14:31.911 --> 00:14:36.911
<v Speaker 1>I think ultimately we will have digital currency across the board for a variety</v>

530
00:14:38.301 --> 00:14:41.750
<v Speaker 1>of different things and it can be really easy for communities,</v>

531
00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:45.410
<v Speaker 1>whether it's online communities or towns to set up their own money.</v>

532
00:14:45.411 --> 00:14:47.720
<v Speaker 1>Because I remember there was a town and man,</v>

533
00:14:47.721 --> 00:14:49.340
<v Speaker 1>I want to say like North Carolina,</v>

534
00:14:49.610 --> 00:14:53.210
<v Speaker 1>but there was a town that was in the news while back where,</v>

535
00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:54.253
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

536
00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:57.440
<v Speaker 1>they had decided to make their own digital,</v>

537
00:14:57.441 --> 00:14:59.690
<v Speaker 1>not digital currency but local currency.</v>

538
00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:02.870
<v Speaker 1>And it was being talked about in the news and it was like everybody sort of</v>

539
00:15:02.871 --> 00:15:06.380
<v Speaker 1>agreed what things would be worth and they would all have their own,</v>

540
00:15:06.570 --> 00:15:06.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

541
00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:11.390
<v Speaker 1>way of trading goods and selling things and passing it back and forth to each</v>

542
00:15:11.391 --> 00:15:12.224
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>

543
00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:13.100
<v Speaker 1>I see that,</v>

544
00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:13.550
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

545
00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:15.470
<v Speaker 1>That like as an online thing</v>

546
00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:16.500
<v Speaker 5>be everywhere.</v>

547
00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:16.781
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

548
00:15:16.781 --> 00:15:19.500
<v Speaker 5>It is the decentralization of the power,</v>

549
00:15:19.530 --> 00:15:20.280
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

550
00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:24.360
<v Speaker 5>why should some person in Missouri be concerned with what guys on Wall Street</v>

551
00:15:24.361 --> 00:15:24.870
<v Speaker 5>are doing?</v>

552
00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:25.320
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>

553
00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:25.741
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

554
00:15:25.741 --> 00:15:26.510
<v Speaker 5>Like what,</v>

555
00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:26.890
<v Speaker 5>why,</v>

556
00:15:26.890 --> 00:15:27.141
<v Speaker 5>how,</v>

557
00:15:27.141 --> 00:15:28.530
<v Speaker 5>why is that affecting you?</v>

558
00:15:28.531 --> 00:15:30.000
<v Speaker 5>Why are you allowing it to affect you,</v>

559
00:15:30.090 --> 00:15:30.630
<v Speaker 5>I guess?</v>

560
00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:32.610
<v Speaker 5>Does it have to be all international like this?</v>

561
00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:34.171
<v Speaker 5>I don't know this,</v>

562
00:15:34.171 --> 00:15:35.550
<v Speaker 5>there's smarter people than me,</v>

563
00:15:35.551 --> 00:15:38.220
<v Speaker 5>that that's probably something to say about that,</v>

564
00:15:38.221 --> 00:15:39.290
<v Speaker 5>but the,</v>

565
00:15:39.570 --> 00:15:40.740
<v Speaker 5>when the bailout happened,</v>

566
00:15:40.741 --> 00:15:41.340
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

567
00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:42.570
<v Speaker 5>That was the conversation.</v>

568
00:15:42.571 --> 00:15:43.170
<v Speaker 5>It was,</v>

569
00:15:43.170 --> 00:15:43.411
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

570
00:15:43.411 --> 00:15:45.530
<v Speaker 5>dudes in suits taking money away from</v>

571
00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:47.280
<v Speaker 1>dudes and plaid shirts.</v>

572
00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:49.190
<v Speaker 1>Do you know Michael Shermer is,</v>

573
00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:50.080
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

574
00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:51.390
<v Speaker 1>Was He famous skeptic?</v>

575
00:15:51.810 --> 00:15:52.710
<v Speaker 1>Was he on the podcast?</v>

576
00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:53.300
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

577
00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:53.520
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

578
00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:54.050
<v Speaker 1>you guys.</v>

579
00:15:54.050 --> 00:15:54.330
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

580
00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:55.320
<v Speaker 1>He's a famous skeptic.</v>

581
00:15:55.830 --> 00:16:00.150
<v Speaker 1>He wrote this very strange article for scientific America that's been chewed</v>

582
00:16:00.151 --> 00:16:00.984
<v Speaker 1>apart.</v>

583
00:16:00.990 --> 00:16:01.441
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

584
00:16:01.441 --> 00:16:02.070
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

585
00:16:02.070 --> 00:16:02.730
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

586
00:16:02.730 --> 00:16:03.090
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

587
00:16:03.090 --> 00:16:07.140
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting because it's like his idea of a,</v>

588
00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:08.640
<v Speaker 1>if you like Google,</v>

589
00:16:08.641 --> 00:16:10.620
<v Speaker 1>Michael Shermer Scientific America,</v>

590
00:16:10.621 --> 00:16:11.890
<v Speaker 1>he apparently writes a,</v>

591
00:16:11.891 --> 00:16:16.891
<v Speaker 1>a an article there and he's got this myth of income inequality is like the title</v>

592
00:16:18.451 --> 00:16:19.590
<v Speaker 1>of the article.</v>

593
00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:20.910
<v Speaker 1>And look,</v>

594
00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:24.990
<v Speaker 1>this is how I know your ideas about finance or dumb.</v>

595
00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:26.910
<v Speaker 1>If I think they're dumb,</v>

596
00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:29.430
<v Speaker 1>this is how I know because I'm clearly dumb.</v>

597
00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:30.330
<v Speaker 1>That's the litmus test.</v>

598
00:16:30.331 --> 00:16:32.400
<v Speaker 1>If I read your dumb shit and I'm like,</v>

599
00:16:32.401 --> 00:16:32.551
<v Speaker 1>Yo,</v>

600
00:16:32.551 --> 00:16:37.551
<v Speaker 1>this is some dumb shit that that's when you know that your shit is off.</v>

601
00:16:37.950 --> 00:16:39.360
<v Speaker 1>It's really strange.</v>

602
00:16:39.361 --> 00:16:42.270
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird analysis of the,</v>

603
00:16:42.271 --> 00:16:43.104
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

604
00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:46.330
<v Speaker 1>of the situation and uh,</v>

605
00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:48.540
<v Speaker 1>the idea that here's,</v>

606
00:16:48.541 --> 00:16:49.560
<v Speaker 1>here's like one quote,</v>

607
00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:51.210
<v Speaker 1>almost all of our studies participants,</v>

608
00:16:51.211 --> 00:16:54.180
<v Speaker 1>the authors conclude grossly underestimated Americans,</v>

609
00:16:54.181 --> 00:16:59.130
<v Speaker 1>average household incomes and overestimated the level of income inequality.</v>

610
00:16:59.910 --> 00:17:04.530
<v Speaker 1>So both income inequality and social mobility though not as ideal as we would</v>

611
00:17:04.531 --> 00:17:08.460
<v Speaker 1>like them to be in the land of equal opportunity or not as large and in mobile</v>

612
00:17:08.461 --> 00:17:09.840
<v Speaker 1>as most of us perceive them,</v>

613
00:17:10.350 --> 00:17:12.460
<v Speaker 1>he's getting destroyed in the,</v>

614
00:17:12.810 --> 00:17:13.230
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

615
00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:14.760
<v Speaker 5>whenever I see something like that,</v>

616
00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:19.880
<v Speaker 5>I always wonder if it's the audience dictating the message or the message being</v>

617
00:17:20.161 --> 00:17:24.030
<v Speaker 5>authentic because I always wonder who are the people reading this magazine?</v>

618
00:17:24.031 --> 00:17:25.290
<v Speaker 5>They're probably fairly well off,</v>

619
00:17:25.291 --> 00:17:26.030
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

620
00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:26.780
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible] scientific,</v>

621
00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:28.200
<v Speaker 5>American American or whatever.</v>

622
00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:29.610
<v Speaker 5>So aren't you?</v>

623
00:17:29.611 --> 00:17:34.200
<v Speaker 5>Isn't it easier to reinforce what they want to hear then it is to start stir</v>

624
00:17:34.201 --> 00:17:34.880
<v Speaker 5>something up?</v>

625
00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:35.391
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

626
00:17:35.391 --> 00:17:36.260
<v Speaker 1>but when I've read this,</v>

627
00:17:36.261 --> 00:17:38.570
<v Speaker 1>this is when I read something that's so goofy like this.</v>

628
00:17:38.571 --> 00:17:41.150
<v Speaker 1>This is obviously like a libertarian slant.</v>

629
00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:41.991
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

630
00:17:41.991 --> 00:17:44.420
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of people that they,</v>

631
00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:45.050
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

632
00:17:45.050 --> 00:17:50.050
<v Speaker 1>they lean libertarian and libertarian almost has like a bit of a conservative</v>

633
00:17:51.541 --> 00:17:56.400
<v Speaker 1>context to it or a conservative bend to it because it's a lot of that things are</v>

634
00:17:56.401 --> 00:17:58.050
<v Speaker 1>not as bad as everyone is perceiving.</v>

635
00:17:58.051 --> 00:17:59.640
<v Speaker 1>Pull yourself up by your bootstraps.</v>

636
00:17:59.670 --> 00:18:00.540
<v Speaker 1>The ability to,</v>

637
00:18:00.930 --> 00:18:01.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

638
00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:04.230
<v Speaker 1>to have more freedom will equal more,</v>

639
00:18:04.231 --> 00:18:04.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

640
00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:08.160
<v Speaker 1>less regulation and more freedom will equal more prosperity.</v>

641
00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:09.420
<v Speaker 1>It's online,</v>

642
00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:10.290
<v Speaker 1>it's an ideology.</v>

643
00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:15.150
<v Speaker 1>It's an ideology as much as being a conservative is as much as being a liberal</v>

644
00:18:15.151 --> 00:18:19.470
<v Speaker 1>is like sometimes people that get on that one team and then they just sort of</v>

645
00:18:19.471 --> 00:18:21.250
<v Speaker 1>adopt the ideas and the inclinations.</v>

646
00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:21.460
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

647
00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:22.293
<v Speaker 1>Team.</v>

648
00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:24.270
<v Speaker 1>So this seems like what he's doing,</v>

649
00:18:24.271 --> 00:18:25.850
<v Speaker 1>and this is again coming from Warren,</v>

650
00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:30.240
<v Speaker 1>this seems like a very libertarian in its slant and it just,</v>

651
00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:32.970
<v Speaker 1>whenever someone does something like this,</v>

652
00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:33.480
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

653
00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:36.840
<v Speaker 1>it makes me question like all the things that they think about,</v>

654
00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:40.410
<v Speaker 1>like you're supposed to be a guy who points out logical fallacies.</v>

655
00:18:40.410 --> 00:18:41.970
<v Speaker 1>He's involved in critical thinking,</v>

656
00:18:41.971 --> 00:18:44.550
<v Speaker 1>objective reasoning and you say something like this.</v>

657
00:18:44.551 --> 00:18:45.384
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

658
00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:46.141
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

659
00:18:46.141 --> 00:18:46.610
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

660
00:18:46.610 --> 00:18:48.570
<v Speaker 5>there's crazy inequality in this country.</v>

661
00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:50.870
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's the night that is insane.</v>

662
00:18:50.871 --> 00:18:55.190
<v Speaker 5>That's exactly what I was going to say is I think the separation between rich</v>

663
00:18:55.191 --> 00:18:57.050
<v Speaker 5>and poor is such an obvious thing.</v>

664
00:18:57.560 --> 00:18:58.101
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

665
00:18:58.101 --> 00:19:00.020
<v Speaker 5>how can you dispute it?</v>

666
00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:01.080
<v Speaker 5>I watched,</v>

667
00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:02.750
<v Speaker 5>I can't remember the name of the documentary right now,</v>

668
00:19:02.751 --> 00:19:04.160
<v Speaker 5>but it followed a couple of people,</v>

669
00:19:04.161 --> 00:19:09.161
<v Speaker 5>silicon valley type a entrepreneurs and tracked their incomes relative to those</v>

670
00:19:10.251 --> 00:19:15.140
<v Speaker 5>of individuals within the company and the sort of ratio over time,</v>

671
00:19:15.141 --> 00:19:15.740
<v Speaker 5>how those,</v>

672
00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:16.670
<v Speaker 5>how those have changed.</v>

673
00:19:16.671 --> 00:19:18.410
<v Speaker 5>But if you look at technology,</v>

674
00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:19.470
<v Speaker 5>which is sort of the,</v>

675
00:19:19.790 --> 00:19:21.380
<v Speaker 5>the angle that I'm looking at it from,</v>

676
00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:25.610
<v Speaker 5>the whole intent more often than not is to build in efficient,</v>

677
00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:27.680
<v Speaker 5>like build efficiencies into your process.</v>

678
00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:29.720
<v Speaker 5>So if you're Amazon,</v>

679
00:19:29.721 --> 00:19:30.554
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>

680
00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:32.960
<v Speaker 5>figure out a way to run your warehouse without people.</v>

681
00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:37.460
<v Speaker 5>Figure out what figured out a way to have robots do to automate all of it,</v>

682
00:19:37.461 --> 00:19:37.820
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

683
00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:42.430
<v Speaker 5>Because essentially your bottom line is affected by how much you cannot like,</v>

684
00:19:42.431 --> 00:19:44.150
<v Speaker 5>like the automakers for example,</v>

685
00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:45.410
<v Speaker 5>get robots in there that,</v>

686
00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:45.710
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

687
00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:50.710
<v Speaker 5>their technologies appears to push in this direction of eliminating humans from</v>

688
00:19:51.261 --> 00:19:55.670
<v Speaker 5>the equation where it becomes tougher to pinpoint where the actual value is</v>

689
00:19:55.671 --> 00:19:56.740
<v Speaker 5>being added in,</v>

690
00:19:57.020 --> 00:19:58.220
<v Speaker 5>in the product that you're receiving.</v>

691
00:19:58.221 --> 00:20:00.590
<v Speaker 5>So it's not like Amazon warehouses don't have humans in them.</v>

692
00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:03.350
<v Speaker 5>They do and they're creating jobs and they can go around and say,</v>

693
00:20:03.351 --> 00:20:04.280
<v Speaker 5>we open a new warehouse,</v>

694
00:20:04.281 --> 00:20:06.980
<v Speaker 5>so we hired 200 people or whatever it might be,</v>

695
00:20:06.981 --> 00:20:09.440
<v Speaker 5>but once upon a time without the automation,</v>

696
00:20:09.441 --> 00:20:10.640
<v Speaker 5>how many people would that have been?</v>

697
00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:11.511
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

698
00:20:11.511 --> 00:20:12.470
<v Speaker 5>And what is going to happen</v>

699
00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:13.353
<v Speaker 1>then when they,</v>

700
00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:13.571
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

701
00:20:13.571 --> 00:20:15.700
<v Speaker 1>are they really testing drones for delivery?</v>

702
00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:17.140
<v Speaker 1>That's not bullshit.</v>

703
00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:17.441
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

704
00:20:17.441 --> 00:20:18.370
<v Speaker 5>that's not bullshit.</v>

705
00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:19.233
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's not,</v>

706
00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:23.680
<v Speaker 5>I think it's not nearly as close as the video makes it seem,</v>

707
00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:25.840
<v Speaker 5>but just the idea that there's the idea,</v>

708
00:20:25.841 --> 00:20:27.190
<v Speaker 5>the idea that it's not,</v>

709
00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:28.453
<v Speaker 5>it's going to happen.</v>

710
00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:32.790
<v Speaker 1>It's like when they first made those photographs where you put the hood on and</v>

711
00:20:32.791 --> 00:20:33.890
<v Speaker 1>you stood up there and don't,</v>

712
00:20:34.430 --> 00:20:34.680
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

713
00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:38.220
<v Speaker 5>they had that thing and like was it like 1850 or something like that?</v>

714
00:20:38.221 --> 00:20:38.710
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

715
00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:42.610
<v Speaker 1>The time between that and having it in your pocket was inevitable.</v>

716
00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:43.673
<v Speaker 1>It's definitely,</v>

717
00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:46.090
<v Speaker 1>all those ideas are out there.</v>

718
00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:47.620
<v Speaker 1>Someone just has to them.</v>

719
00:20:47.770 --> 00:20:48.310
<v Speaker 1>Definitely.</v>

720
00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:52.660
<v Speaker 1>So once we have drones that there are testing that a delivering products,</v>

721
00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:57.780
<v Speaker 1>it's a matter of time before the skies are filled with robot delivery trucks</v>

722
00:20:58.120 --> 00:20:58.570
<v Speaker 1>that are,</v>

723
00:20:58.570 --> 00:21:00.460
<v Speaker 1>they're landing places and dropping off</v>

724
00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:01.221
<v Speaker 5>TV's.</v>

725
00:21:01.221 --> 00:21:03.890
<v Speaker 5>And definitely I think the last time we were here we're talking about self</v>

726
00:21:03.891 --> 00:21:06.070
<v Speaker 5>driving cars and how it,</v>

727
00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:09.140
<v Speaker 5>like in an airplane it's okay for that process to be automated.</v>

728
00:21:09.141 --> 00:21:10.670
<v Speaker 5>But in cars we freak out about it.</v>

729
00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:12.950
<v Speaker 5>He said he didn't think it's the same thing with drones.</v>

730
00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:14.930
<v Speaker 5>People are afraid of what they don't know,</v>

731
00:21:14.931 --> 00:21:15.950
<v Speaker 5>afraid of the unknown.</v>

732
00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:19.460
<v Speaker 5>But maybe drones are a little bit further out.</v>

733
00:21:19.461 --> 00:21:23.450
<v Speaker 5>But what's happening right now is also interesting and exciting and it's kind of</v>

734
00:21:23.451 --> 00:21:26.180
<v Speaker 5>flying under the radar in the sense that you're,</v>

735
00:21:26.210 --> 00:21:28.220
<v Speaker 5>you have a Amazon prime,</v>

736
00:21:28.221 --> 00:21:29.240
<v Speaker 5>you have Amazon fresh,</v>

737
00:21:29.241 --> 00:21:33.830
<v Speaker 5>you have all these ways of getting things that you need without necessarily the</v>

738
00:21:33.831 --> 00:21:34.664
<v Speaker 5>same,</v>

739
00:21:34.670 --> 00:21:35.270
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

740
00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:36.200
<v Speaker 5>the same ecosystem,</v>

741
00:21:36.201 --> 00:21:39.470
<v Speaker 5>the same same chain that you once would have had where you had a delivery man</v>

742
00:21:39.471 --> 00:21:42.980
<v Speaker 5>brings it to a store and then the person in the store puts it on the shelf and</v>

743
00:21:42.981 --> 00:21:45.890
<v Speaker 5>then you have to go to the store to buy it and you have to go through a cashier</v>

744
00:21:45.891 --> 00:21:47.240
<v Speaker 5>instead of an automated checkout.</v>

745
00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:50.780
<v Speaker 5>Just a number of human beings involved in that process used to be a lot more,</v>

746
00:21:50.781 --> 00:21:53.810
<v Speaker 5>so everybody in that value chain could take a little piece for themselves.</v>

747
00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:56.330
<v Speaker 5>But in this Amazon universe,</v>

748
00:21:56.360 --> 00:22:00.620
<v Speaker 5>it's all about eliminating those cogs and just doing a to B.</v>

749
00:22:00.830 --> 00:22:02.090
<v Speaker 5>So yeah,</v>

750
00:22:02.091 --> 00:22:04.280
<v Speaker 5>a drone is maybe the end game,</v>

751
00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:05.600
<v Speaker 5>but even right now,</v>

752
00:22:05.930 --> 00:22:07.490
<v Speaker 5>there's a huge impact to that,</v>

753
00:22:07.730 --> 00:22:09.020
<v Speaker 5>that form of consumption.</v>

754
00:22:09.570 --> 00:22:09.991
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

755
00:22:09.991 --> 00:22:10.824
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

756
00:22:10.970 --> 00:22:11.340
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

757
00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:16.340
<v Speaker 1>it's so strange to wash the climate shift and change and it's so strange to</v>

758
00:22:16.741 --> 00:22:18.450
<v Speaker 1>watch just online shopping.</v>

759
00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:19.740
<v Speaker 1>Remember I,</v>

760
00:22:19.810 --> 00:22:22.110
<v Speaker 1>I did some online shopping a year ago.</v>

761
00:22:22.170 --> 00:22:23.100
<v Speaker 1>I mean not a year ago.</v>

762
00:22:23.101 --> 00:22:24.210
<v Speaker 1>A while ago rather.</v>

763
00:22:24.450 --> 00:22:25.170
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

764
00:22:25.170 --> 00:22:26.400
<v Speaker 1>I forget what it was that I bought,</v>

765
00:22:26.401 --> 00:22:26.971
<v Speaker 1>but somebody said,</v>

766
00:22:26.971 --> 00:22:27.481
<v Speaker 1>where'd you get that?</v>

767
00:22:27.481 --> 00:22:27.691
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

768
00:22:27.691 --> 00:22:29.400
<v Speaker 1>I got online and he was like,</v>

769
00:22:29.401 --> 00:22:29.791
<v Speaker 1>Oh man,</v>

770
00:22:29.791 --> 00:22:30.960
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't buy anything online.</v>

771
00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:32.160
<v Speaker 1>Put your credit card out there.</v>

772
00:22:32.161 --> 00:22:33.120
<v Speaker 1>That's how long ago was that?</v>

773
00:22:33.150 --> 00:22:33.850
<v Speaker 1>Long time ago.</v>

774
00:22:33.850 --> 00:22:34.060
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

775
00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:34.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

776
00:22:34.290 --> 00:22:34.560
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

777
00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:34.870
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

778
00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:36.370
<v Speaker 1>I was on when,</v>

779
00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:38.400
<v Speaker 1>when online shopping first existed,</v>

780
00:22:38.430 --> 00:22:39.263
<v Speaker 1>I was buying things.</v>

781
00:22:39.390 --> 00:22:39.930
<v Speaker 1>I was just like,</v>

782
00:22:39.930 --> 00:22:40.920
<v Speaker 1>this is so crazy.</v>

783
00:22:40.921 --> 00:22:41.460
<v Speaker 1>So cool.</v>

784
00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:43.660
<v Speaker 1>You could find something online then shows up in your,</v>

785
00:22:44.550 --> 00:22:45.271
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>

786
00:22:45.271 --> 00:22:45.690
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

787
00:22:45.690 --> 00:22:50.690
<v Speaker 1>now it's almost more common to shop online than it is to not shop online.</v>

788
00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:51.560
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

789
00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:52.340
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

790
00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:53.990
<v Speaker 5>I don't know why mom still,</v>

791
00:22:54.590 --> 00:22:58.280
<v Speaker 5>I would never put my credit card on there and my mom's not like super old,</v>

792
00:22:58.281 --> 00:23:00.040
<v Speaker 5>but I think that word,</v>

793
00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:01.460
<v Speaker 5>we just do it.</v>

794
00:23:01.490 --> 00:23:04.790
<v Speaker 5>So we think everyone does well and it depends on the item as well.</v>

795
00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:05.591
<v Speaker 1>What percentage?</v>

796
00:23:05.591 --> 00:23:06.424
<v Speaker 1>Let's take a guess.</v>

797
00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:08.890
<v Speaker 1>What percentage of Americans shop on?</v>

798
00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:09.943
<v Speaker 5>I'd say</v>

799
00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:12.470
<v Speaker 5>60% Oh,</v>

800
00:23:12.471 --> 00:23:15.200
<v Speaker 5>that actually do it at all frequently.</v>

801
00:23:15.350 --> 00:23:15.831
<v Speaker 5>Frequently?</v>

802
00:23:15.831 --> 00:23:17.900
<v Speaker 5>I'd say 50 to 60% what's free?</v>

803
00:23:17.930 --> 00:23:18.690
<v Speaker 5>What's frequently?</v>

804
00:23:18.690 --> 00:23:19.520
<v Speaker 5>Once a week.</v>

805
00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:19.971
<v Speaker 5>First of all,</v>

806
00:23:19.971 --> 00:23:21.350
<v Speaker 5>if you tied once a month,</v>

807
00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:23.630
<v Speaker 5>if you type in what percentage of Americans,</v>

808
00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:25.820
<v Speaker 5>the first question is are gay,</v>

809
00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:30.620
<v Speaker 5>what does that tell you about people using Google search?</v>

810
00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:33.470
<v Speaker 5>What percentage of Americans are gay is first?</v>

811
00:23:33.471 --> 00:23:34.950
<v Speaker 5>What percentage are Christians?</v>

812
00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:35.910
<v Speaker 5>Second though?</v>

813
00:23:35.910 --> 00:23:38.300
<v Speaker 5>Is that really that strange if you think about it,</v>

814
00:23:38.330 --> 00:23:38.960
<v Speaker 5>yes.</v>

815
00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:40.400
<v Speaker 5>Do you have the answer to that question?</v>

816
00:23:40.430 --> 00:23:41.090
<v Speaker 5>The gay part?</v>

817
00:23:41.090 --> 00:23:41.923
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

818
00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:43.131
<v Speaker 5>How close?</v>

819
00:23:43.131 --> 00:23:44.690
<v Speaker 5>How close would we ask everyone's gay.</v>

820
00:23:45.930 --> 00:23:46.130
<v Speaker 5>Even</v>

821
00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:46.963
<v Speaker 2>enough time?</v>

822
00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:48.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

823
00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:49.130
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's gay.</v>

824
00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:50.180
<v Speaker 2>You just need enough time.</v>

825
00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:53.780
<v Speaker 2>I'm just curious what that top till the search is a common search.</v>

826
00:23:53.781 --> 00:23:56.000
<v Speaker 2>I'm just curious what the top result actually is.</v>

827
00:23:56.020 --> 00:23:56.300
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

828
00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:57.133
<v Speaker 2>Wikipedia.</v>

829
00:23:58.070 --> 00:24:00.620
<v Speaker 2>What do you think based on your own findings?</v>

830
00:24:00.621 --> 00:24:02.630
<v Speaker 2>Like the people I see in America,</v>

831
00:24:02.631 --> 00:24:04.940
<v Speaker 2>so I don't have enough experience with all of America.</v>

832
00:24:04.941 --> 00:24:05.601
<v Speaker 2>Just humans.</v>

833
00:24:05.601 --> 00:24:06.051
<v Speaker 2>Canada.</v>

834
00:24:06.051 --> 00:24:06.331
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

835
00:24:06.331 --> 00:24:07.550
<v Speaker 2>you guys are American north?</v>

836
00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:08.160
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

837
00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:08.511
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

838
00:24:08.511 --> 00:24:09.260
<v Speaker 2>but I'm saying,</v>

839
00:24:09.260 --> 00:24:12.980
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking more about urban urban areas versus rural areas,</v>

840
00:24:13.110 --> 00:24:13.630
<v Speaker 2>royals,</v>

841
00:24:13.630 --> 00:24:14.463
<v Speaker 2>they're all gay.</v>

842
00:24:14.810 --> 00:24:16.040
<v Speaker 2>All those farmers are as fuck.</v>

843
00:24:16.610 --> 00:24:17.470
<v Speaker 2>They might not even know.</v>

844
00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:18.111
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm talking about.</v>

845
00:24:18.111 --> 00:24:18.530
<v Speaker 2>Like I have,</v>

846
00:24:18.530 --> 00:24:20.390
<v Speaker 2>I have city experience.</v>

847
00:24:20.391 --> 00:24:21.980
<v Speaker 2>I don't have any country experience.</v>

848
00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:22.940
<v Speaker 2>Do you think it's different?</v>

849
00:24:23.590 --> 00:24:24.620
<v Speaker 2>I think they hide anymore.</v>

850
00:24:24.650 --> 00:24:25.410
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

851
00:24:25.410 --> 00:24:30.210
<v Speaker 5>the city country thing is more defining than than say the city.</v>

852
00:24:30.211 --> 00:24:30.751
<v Speaker 5>You come from.</v>

853
00:24:30.751 --> 00:24:31.200
<v Speaker 5>Like people say,</v>

854
00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:31.291
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

855
00:24:31.291 --> 00:24:34.080
<v Speaker 5>somebody from Chicago is like this and somebody from New York is like that.</v>

856
00:24:34.350 --> 00:24:34.741
<v Speaker 5>In fact,</v>

857
00:24:34.741 --> 00:24:35.140
<v Speaker 5>I've,</v>

858
00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:39.060
<v Speaker 5>I've been in marketing meetings where they have specific terms for those urban</v>

859
00:24:39.061 --> 00:24:39.900
<v Speaker 5>type of people.</v>

860
00:24:40.110 --> 00:24:41.370
<v Speaker 5>And you're talking about black folk?</v>

861
00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:41.810
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

862
00:24:41.810 --> 00:24:41.920
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

863
00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:42.130
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

864
00:24:42.130 --> 00:24:42.221
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

865
00:24:42.221 --> 00:24:42.281
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

866
00:24:42.281 --> 00:24:42.341
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

867
00:24:42.341 --> 00:24:42.560
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

868
00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:43.700
<v Speaker 2>Not Eric got Canadian.</v>

869
00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:44.030
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

870
00:24:44.030 --> 00:24:44.990
<v Speaker 2>not urban like that.</v>

871
00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:45.853
<v Speaker 2>But I mean,</v>

872
00:24:46.730 --> 00:24:47.540
<v Speaker 2>I mean the life</v>

873
00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:51.650
<v Speaker 5>experience of a person who lives in a high rise versus the type of person who</v>

874
00:24:51.651 --> 00:24:52.610
<v Speaker 5>has a few acres.</v>

875
00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:54.860
<v Speaker 5>It's a totally different life experience.</v>

876
00:24:54.861 --> 00:24:59.120
<v Speaker 5>And therefore the culture that you participate in is going to be a little bit</v>

877
00:24:59.121 --> 00:24:59.780
<v Speaker 5>different.</v>

878
00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:01.790
<v Speaker 5>So when people say to me,</v>

879
00:25:01.791 --> 00:25:02.330
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>

880
00:25:02.330 --> 00:25:02.630
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

881
00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:03.350
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

882
00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:04.183
<v Speaker 5>you're Canadian,</v>

883
00:25:04.250 --> 00:25:05.600
<v Speaker 5>you been to Toronto a lot,</v>

884
00:25:05.601 --> 00:25:05.901
<v Speaker 5>so you know,</v>

885
00:25:05.901 --> 00:25:07.400
<v Speaker 5>it's roughly the same kind of idea.</v>

886
00:25:07.790 --> 00:25:09.710
<v Speaker 5>But when you ask me a question like that,</v>

887
00:25:09.711 --> 00:25:14.711
<v Speaker 5>statistically I would say Toronto was probably more like New York then New York</v>

888
00:25:15.111 --> 00:25:16.730
<v Speaker 5>is like Kansas City.</v>

889
00:25:16.850 --> 00:25:17.271
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

890
00:25:17.271 --> 00:25:17.900
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>

891
00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:18.231
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

892
00:25:18.231 --> 00:25:19.280
<v Speaker 2>I agree with you on that.</v>

893
00:25:19.550 --> 00:25:20.383
<v Speaker 2>Except folks.</v>

894
00:25:20.430 --> 00:25:20.840
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

895
00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:21.060
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

896
00:25:21.060 --> 00:25:25.580
<v Speaker 2>the big difference between Canadians and Americans is how nice everybody is this</v>

897
00:25:25.581 --> 00:25:25.881
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

898
00:25:25.881 --> 00:25:28.850
<v Speaker 2>More nice people for whatever reason he thinks of urban centers.</v>

899
00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:29.980
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

900
00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:30.340
<v Speaker 5>I know.</v>

901
00:25:30.340 --> 00:25:31.090
<v Speaker 5>I know.</v>

902
00:25:31.090 --> 00:25:32.620
<v Speaker 5>I noticed people say,</v>

903
00:25:32.621 --> 00:25:33.371
<v Speaker 5>excuse me in,</v>

904
00:25:33.371 --> 00:25:33.980
<v Speaker 5>sorry a lot</v>

905
00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:35.300
<v Speaker 2>more that has me,</v>

906
00:25:35.301 --> 00:25:35.871
<v Speaker 2>sorry.</v>

907
00:25:35.871 --> 00:25:36.850
<v Speaker 2>Pardon me.</v>

908
00:25:36.851 --> 00:25:38.840
<v Speaker 2>High doing smiling smile.</v>

909
00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:40.790
<v Speaker 2>It's just a friendlier place that happens.</v>

910
00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:45.390
<v Speaker 2>I feel like it's probably because you don't have this background of Congress,</v>

911
00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:46.161
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

912
00:25:46.161 --> 00:25:47.090
<v Speaker 2>it's a different beast.</v>

913
00:25:47.150 --> 00:25:50.030
<v Speaker 2>It's a different kind of mentality that set up the country.</v>

914
00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:50.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

915
00:25:50.570 --> 00:25:53.540
<v Speaker 2>Where's the America is definitely different culture for sure.</v>

916
00:25:53.570 --> 00:25:55.190
<v Speaker 2>Definitely close it.</v>

917
00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:56.120
<v Speaker 2>Oh Yay.</v>

918
00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:57.310
<v Speaker 5>Take a little bit twisted,</v>

919
00:25:57.311 --> 00:25:57.731
<v Speaker 5>sort of,</v>

920
00:25:57.731 --> 00:25:58.151
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

921
00:25:58.151 --> 00:25:58.841
<v Speaker 5>and again,</v>

922
00:25:58.841 --> 00:26:00.460
<v Speaker 5>it varies depending on where you are,</v>

923
00:26:00.461 --> 00:26:01.810
<v Speaker 5>but one of the,</v>

924
00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:04.960
<v Speaker 5>one of the things that comes up more than anything has guns,</v>

925
00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:06.220
<v Speaker 5>gun,</v>

926
00:26:06.220 --> 00:26:06.670
<v Speaker 5>the gun,</v>

927
00:26:06.670 --> 00:26:11.110
<v Speaker 5>the difference in the perception of gun crime,</v>

928
00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:11.770
<v Speaker 5>et Cetera.</v>

929
00:26:11.770 --> 00:26:14.110
<v Speaker 5>That conversation always comes up when I'm talking to,</v>

930
00:26:14.550 --> 00:26:15.070
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

931
00:26:15.070 --> 00:26:18.640
<v Speaker 5>people from America that asking me what the differences and that,</v>

932
00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:19.180
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

933
00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:21.220
<v Speaker 5>famously that Michael Moore documentary,</v>

934
00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:22.121
<v Speaker 5>what the hell?</v>

935
00:26:22.121 --> 00:26:22.954
<v Speaker 5>Which one was it?</v>

936
00:26:23.770 --> 00:26:25.240
<v Speaker 2>His one of his first ones.</v>

937
00:26:25.630 --> 00:26:26.890
<v Speaker 2>But bowling for Columbine.</v>

938
00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:27.491
<v Speaker 2>Was it bowling?</v>

939
00:26:27.491 --> 00:26:28.280
<v Speaker 2>Bowling for Columbine?</v>

940
00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:28.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

941
00:26:28.770 --> 00:26:29.603
<v Speaker 5>Where he,</v>

942
00:26:29.910 --> 00:26:34.050
<v Speaker 5>he's from Michigan and he went over the border to Windsor from Detroit.</v>

943
00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:35.371
<v Speaker 5>And I don't know,</v>

944
00:26:35.371 --> 00:26:38.280
<v Speaker 5>he had some statistics in there and people weren't locking their doors in</v>

945
00:26:38.281 --> 00:26:38.761
<v Speaker 5>Windsor.</v>

946
00:26:38.761 --> 00:26:39.301
<v Speaker 5>And I don't know,</v>

947
00:26:39.301 --> 00:26:40.970
<v Speaker 5>he had a lot of people thought that that was hard.</v>

948
00:26:40.971 --> 00:26:42.180
<v Speaker 5>She thought it was horse shit too.</v>

949
00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:44.100
<v Speaker 5>But he trying to draw some</v>

950
00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:47.730
<v Speaker 2>kind of conclusion there that even though we're culturally identical,</v>

951
00:26:47.731 --> 00:26:48.541
<v Speaker 2>we don't shoot each other,</v>

952
00:26:48.541 --> 00:26:49.770
<v Speaker 2>which obviously is not true,</v>

953
00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:54.150
<v Speaker 2>but some of the statistics coming out of Chicago right now are crazy as far as</v>

954
00:26:54.390 --> 00:26:58.470
<v Speaker 2>the amount of people that are dying due to gang warfare,</v>

955
00:26:58.471 --> 00:26:58.831
<v Speaker 2>et cetera.</v>

956
00:26:58.831 --> 00:27:01.050
<v Speaker 2>Like there's nothing like that at all.</v>

957
00:27:01.051 --> 00:27:01.831
<v Speaker 2>So I don't know.</v>

958
00:27:01.831 --> 00:27:02.910
<v Speaker 2>There isn't like that in Canada.</v>

959
00:27:02.911 --> 00:27:03.510
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

960
00:27:03.510 --> 00:27:04.230
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

961
00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:05.490
<v Speaker 2>I think Toronto,</v>

962
00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:07.680
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to say a number because I don't know,</v>

963
00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:09.180
<v Speaker 2>but murder figures,</v>

964
00:27:09.181 --> 00:27:12.930
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's one of the safest and Rob Ford think I've kept you guys to say,</v>

965
00:27:12.931 --> 00:27:14.040
<v Speaker 2>but doing all your crack.</v>

966
00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:16.950
<v Speaker 2>That's what he does is spin it off the street strategy.</v>

967
00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:18.210
<v Speaker 2>Hanging out with the thugs.</v>

968
00:27:18.270 --> 00:27:18.511
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

969
00:27:18.511 --> 00:27:21.530
<v Speaker 2>He was trying to calm everybody down towards overweight white people.</v>

970
00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:22.440
<v Speaker 2>Is that the prince,</v>

971
00:27:22.441 --> 00:27:23.400
<v Speaker 2>that book about,</v>

972
00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:24.511
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember,</v>

973
00:27:24.511 --> 00:27:26.370
<v Speaker 2>but a king needs to be down with the people.</v>

974
00:27:26.730 --> 00:27:30.780
<v Speaker 2>You see the minute he gets up on his high horse up on a hill somewhere to go for</v>

975
00:27:30.781 --> 00:27:31.141
<v Speaker 2>crack,</v>

976
00:27:31.141 --> 00:27:32.430
<v Speaker 2>he can't relate anymore.</v>

977
00:27:33.150 --> 00:27:34.110
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm saying.</v>

978
00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:36.810
<v Speaker 2>For New up under a Free Rob Ford.</v>

979
00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:37.590
<v Speaker 2>That's what I say.</v>

980
00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:38.440
<v Speaker 2>I think he's running again.</v>

981
00:27:38.441 --> 00:27:41.490
<v Speaker 2>He's running a porn star actually.</v>

982
00:27:41.510 --> 00:27:42.110
<v Speaker 2>Perfect.</v>

983
00:27:42.110 --> 00:27:42.920
<v Speaker 2>The world's gonna.</v>

984
00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:43.320
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

985
00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:44.153
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking late.</v>

986
00:27:46.050 --> 00:27:46.740
<v Speaker 2>Perfect.</v>

987
00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:47.490
<v Speaker 2>Nikki Benz.</v>

988
00:27:47.490 --> 00:27:52.350
<v Speaker 2>That's the perfect kind of way to look at politics is that if,</v>

989
00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:55.740
<v Speaker 2>if these people can be there and nothing actually happens,</v>

990
00:27:55.980 --> 00:27:57.250
<v Speaker 2>there's no actual effective.</v>

991
00:27:57.251 --> 00:27:57.360
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>

992
00:27:57.360 --> 00:27:57.560
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

993
00:27:57.560 --> 00:28:00.240
<v Speaker 2>it for me it exposes politics as a whole.</v>

994
00:28:00.270 --> 00:28:00.700
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

995
00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:02.970
<v Speaker 2>politics given the state of our culture,</v>

996
00:28:02.971 --> 00:28:05.220
<v Speaker 2>I think the most intelligent,</v>

997
00:28:05.221 --> 00:28:08.280
<v Speaker 2>most capable people don't want that job.</v>

998
00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:10.680
<v Speaker 2>I decided no,</v>

999
00:28:10.681 --> 00:28:14.790
<v Speaker 2>I'll just get some puppet and place to do my bidding and pay them off or you</v>

1000
00:28:14.791 --> 00:28:14.911
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

1001
00:28:14.911 --> 00:28:16.590
<v Speaker 2>it's obviously not that planned out.</v>

1002
00:28:16.591 --> 00:28:18.600
<v Speaker 2>It's like one guy's pulling strength scores,</v>

1003
00:28:18.690 --> 00:28:20.020
<v Speaker 2>but therefore most people,</v>

1004
00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:22.350
<v Speaker 2>they don't want a job that doesn't pay that well.</v>

1005
00:28:22.590 --> 00:28:25.510
<v Speaker 2>It's going to take a shit load of your time and uh,</v>

1006
00:28:25.710 --> 00:28:27.660
<v Speaker 2>everyone's going to hate you no matter what you do.</v>

1007
00:28:27.990 --> 00:28:28.261
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1008
00:28:28.261 --> 00:28:28.650
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>

1009
00:28:28.650 --> 00:28:29.441
<v Speaker 2>who wants that job?</v>

1010
00:28:29.441 --> 00:28:30.000
<v Speaker 2>That's smart.</v>

1011
00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:30.420
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1012
00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:31.253
<v Speaker 2>that's the problem.</v>

1013
00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:31.590
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1014
00:28:31.590 --> 00:28:32.550
<v Speaker 2>we have real issues.</v>

1015
00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:33.370
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

1016
00:28:33.370 --> 00:28:35.180
<v Speaker 2>It's saying actually the Americas,</v>

1017
00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:35.750
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1018
00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:36.040
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

1019
00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:38.880
<v Speaker 2>there's several different articles about shopping online,</v>

1020
00:28:38.881 --> 00:28:39.900
<v Speaker 2>what the numbers were,</v>

1021
00:28:40.170 --> 00:28:42.450
<v Speaker 2>but it's overtaking stores.</v>

1022
00:28:42.750 --> 00:28:47.750
<v Speaker 2>It's saying now 40% 47% of consumers said the internet would be their favorite</v>

1023
00:28:49.021 --> 00:28:50.400
<v Speaker 2>shopping destination.</v>

1024
00:28:51.270 --> 00:28:52.040
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1025
00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:52.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1026
00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:57.680
<v Speaker 2>Here's in 2013 it says more than 80% of the online population has used the</v>

1027
00:28:57.991 --> 00:28:59.310
<v Speaker 2>internet to purchase something.</v>

1028
00:28:59.311 --> 00:29:00.420
<v Speaker 2>So at least once,</v>

1029
00:29:00.421 --> 00:29:02.430
<v Speaker 2>and that's the only people that have used the internet.</v>

1030
00:29:02.431 --> 00:29:03.420
<v Speaker 2>So that of all,</v>

1031
00:29:03.421 --> 00:29:05.370
<v Speaker 2>I'd probably say it'd be lower.</v>

1032
00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:07.500
<v Speaker 2>I'd probably say like 60 globally.</v>

1033
00:29:07.550 --> 00:29:07.740
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1034
00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:07.890
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1035
00:29:07.890 --> 00:29:09.090
<v Speaker 2>there's something we don't have access.</v>

1036
00:29:09.091 --> 00:29:11.190
<v Speaker 2>Like how about how many people shop on their phone?</v>

1037
00:29:11.191 --> 00:29:11.761
<v Speaker 2>What would you say?</v>

1038
00:29:11.761 --> 00:29:13.860
<v Speaker 2>They're all that's growing rapidly.</v>

1039
00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:15.270
<v Speaker 2>I know that for a fact,</v>

1040
00:29:15.550 --> 00:29:15.850
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1041
00:29:15.850 --> 00:29:20.160
<v Speaker 2>I don't know the number seven out of 10 smartphone owners will use their</v>

1042
00:29:20.161 --> 00:29:22.170
<v Speaker 2>smartphone for holiday shopping.</v>

1043
00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:22.740
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1044
00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:24.960
<v Speaker 2>Finding store locations and checking,</v>

1045
00:29:24.961 --> 00:29:29.910
<v Speaker 2>comparing prices being the top two uses with 45% of the consumers saying they</v>

1046
00:29:29.911 --> 00:29:33.120
<v Speaker 2>use social media to assist them with their holiday shopping.</v>

1047
00:29:33.210 --> 00:29:34.440
<v Speaker 2>Definitely fascinating.</v>

1048
00:29:35.310 --> 00:29:39.180
<v Speaker 2>I think social media is a huge,</v>

1049
00:29:39.181 --> 00:29:39.661
<v Speaker 2>huge,</v>

1050
00:29:39.661 --> 00:29:42.550
<v Speaker 2>huge factor in buying electronics.</v>

1051
00:29:42.730 --> 00:29:43.660
<v Speaker 1>Huge mean,</v>

1052
00:29:43.661 --> 00:29:46.300
<v Speaker 1>we're talking your friend Marcus Marquez,</v>

1053
00:29:46.330 --> 00:29:47.500
<v Speaker 1>Marquez who uh,</v>

1054
00:29:47.501 --> 00:29:49.360
<v Speaker 1>also has a videos online.</v>

1055
00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:50.330
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>

1056
00:29:50.330 --> 00:29:53.530
<v Speaker 1>Really in detail videos about cell phones especially.</v>

1057
00:29:53.890 --> 00:29:55.180
<v Speaker 1>He's helped me a lot of,</v>

1058
00:29:55.181 --> 00:29:58.150
<v Speaker 1>I really enjoyed his videos that I was talking to him about it.</v>

1059
00:29:58.151 --> 00:29:58.451
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1060
00:29:58.451 --> 00:30:00.370
<v Speaker 1>there's never been a thing like this before.</v>

1061
00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:00.900
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

1062
00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:01.950
<v Speaker 5>And they uh,</v>

1063
00:30:01.951 --> 00:30:02.940
<v Speaker 5>they actually,</v>

1064
00:30:03.150 --> 00:30:05.340
<v Speaker 5>we were involved in some report recently.</v>

1065
00:30:05.390 --> 00:30:05.670
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1066
00:30:05.670 --> 00:30:07.110
<v Speaker 5>it was at some university report.</v>

1067
00:30:07.630 --> 00:30:08.170
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1068
00:30:08.170 --> 00:30:09.270
<v Speaker 5>I'm not remembering the name,</v>

1069
00:30:09.271 --> 00:30:13.800
<v Speaker 5>but they did some tallying to figure out how many people watch videos like that</v>

1070
00:30:13.801 --> 00:30:15.270
<v Speaker 5>prior to making a purchasing decision.</v>

1071
00:30:15.271 --> 00:30:16.170
<v Speaker 5>The percentage in,</v>

1072
00:30:16.171 --> 00:30:16.801
<v Speaker 5>in our world,</v>

1073
00:30:16.801 --> 00:30:17.521
<v Speaker 5>in the tech space,</v>

1074
00:30:17.521 --> 00:30:18.360
<v Speaker 5>it's huge.</v>

1075
00:30:18.450 --> 00:30:18.800
<v Speaker 5>One,</v>

1076
00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:18.941
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

1077
00:30:18.941 --> 00:30:23.941
<v Speaker 5>the numbers were staggering and so this is really awkward thing going on right</v>

1078
00:30:24.541 --> 00:30:29.310
<v Speaker 5>now where the influencers are becoming the retailers in a way.</v>

1079
00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:33.870
<v Speaker 5>We're taking on that role where it used to be a guy in a blue shirt at best buy</v>

1080
00:30:33.871 --> 00:30:35.400
<v Speaker 5>who could give a shit about the job,</v>

1081
00:30:36.030 --> 00:30:39.450
<v Speaker 5>who you kind of had to deal with whatever information he had,</v>

1082
00:30:39.451 --> 00:30:40.500
<v Speaker 5>you didn't have a choice.</v>

1083
00:30:41.010 --> 00:30:42.210
<v Speaker 5>And now it's like,</v>

1084
00:30:42.390 --> 00:30:43.560
<v Speaker 5>why would we,</v>

1085
00:30:43.830 --> 00:30:44.730
<v Speaker 5>it's not very,</v>

1086
00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:49.200
<v Speaker 5>it's not the best use of resources to take a bunch of unsophisticated</v>

1087
00:30:49.201 --> 00:30:53.130
<v Speaker 5>individuals with a part time job and put them in that role,</v>

1088
00:30:53.370 --> 00:30:55.560
<v Speaker 5>which is essentially a fairly sophisticated role.</v>

1089
00:30:55.590 --> 00:30:56.910
<v Speaker 5>Just keeping up with all this shit,</v>

1090
00:30:56.940 --> 00:30:57.773
<v Speaker 5>which is crazy.</v>

1091
00:30:58.020 --> 00:30:59.550
<v Speaker 5>So let's take one guy,</v>

1092
00:30:59.551 --> 00:31:03.780
<v Speaker 5>give him video as a platform and then allow for him to reach millions.</v>

1093
00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:09.080
<v Speaker 1>And it's also the difference between someone taking on that role as a job and</v>

1094
00:31:09.661 --> 00:31:12.390
<v Speaker 1>someone who's extremely passionate about electronics.</v>

1095
00:31:12.391 --> 00:31:13.410
<v Speaker 1>Completely agree with that.</v>

1096
00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:14.300
<v Speaker 1>That's for you.</v>

1097
00:31:14.310 --> 00:31:15.480
<v Speaker 1>Like a guy like you,</v>

1098
00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:16.500
<v Speaker 1>you would probably,</v>

1099
00:31:16.501 --> 00:31:17.460
<v Speaker 1>no matter what your job is,</v>

1100
00:31:17.461 --> 00:31:19.260
<v Speaker 1>you would still be passionate about electronic</v>

1101
00:31:19.340 --> 00:31:22.220
<v Speaker 5>100% I'd still be having the exact same conversations.</v>

1102
00:31:22.550 --> 00:31:23.220
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes I,</v>

1103
00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:26.210
<v Speaker 5>I feel like I might even be more passionate because I wouldn't be jaded by the</v>

1104
00:31:26.211 --> 00:31:26.601
<v Speaker 5>whole thing.</v>

1105
00:31:26.601 --> 00:31:27.141
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>

1106
00:31:27.141 --> 00:31:27.280
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

1107
00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:29.960
<v Speaker 5>I think in a weird way that might happen,</v>

1108
00:31:29.961 --> 00:31:30.570
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

1109
00:31:30.570 --> 00:31:30.870
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1110
00:31:30.870 --> 00:31:31.281
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1111
00:31:31.281 --> 00:31:31.640
<v Speaker 5>there's,</v>

1112
00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:32.870
<v Speaker 5>there's definitely,</v>

1113
00:31:33.170 --> 00:31:36.560
<v Speaker 5>there's definitely this change happening right now where social media is</v>

1114
00:31:36.561 --> 00:31:40.580
<v Speaker 5>allowing for individuals who you don't know in your personal life to take on the</v>

1115
00:31:40.581 --> 00:31:41.240
<v Speaker 5>role,</v>

1116
00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:41.590
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1117
00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:44.600
<v Speaker 5>where that used to be for somebody connected to you,</v>

1118
00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:45.410
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1119
00:31:45.410 --> 00:31:46.670
<v Speaker 5>immediately connected to you.</v>

1120
00:31:46.910 --> 00:31:47.690
<v Speaker 5>Now the,</v>

1121
00:31:47.690 --> 00:31:48.980
<v Speaker 5>the word of mouth marketing,</v>

1122
00:31:48.981 --> 00:31:50.090
<v Speaker 5>which is a scent was,</v>

1123
00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:51.380
<v Speaker 5>which was the most powerful,</v>

1124
00:31:51.381 --> 00:31:52.760
<v Speaker 5>is still the most powerful,</v>

1125
00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:55.460
<v Speaker 5>is transitioning from word of mouth in real life.</v>

1126
00:31:55.461 --> 00:31:58.100
<v Speaker 5>Real words to social media words.</v>

1127
00:31:58.101 --> 00:32:02.360
<v Speaker 5>Because even though you might be unreachable to people in real life,</v>

1128
00:32:02.390 --> 00:32:04.160
<v Speaker 5>you're not because of social media.</v>

1129
00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:04.820
<v Speaker 5>So I'll,</v>

1130
00:32:04.820 --> 00:32:06.680
<v Speaker 5>so Joe Rogan is an influencer.</v>

1131
00:32:06.740 --> 00:32:07.571
<v Speaker 5>I'm an influencer.</v>

1132
00:32:07.571 --> 00:32:10.660
<v Speaker 5>Marquez is an influencer and all of a sudden you're,</v>

1133
00:32:10.670 --> 00:32:13.580
<v Speaker 5>you're managing this social group of a million friends.</v>

1134
00:32:13.581 --> 00:32:13.911
<v Speaker 5>Essentially.</v>

1135
00:32:13.911 --> 00:32:15.050
<v Speaker 5>That's the way they look at it.</v>

1136
00:32:16.010 --> 00:32:17.120
<v Speaker 5>You're building that connection.</v>

1137
00:32:17.121 --> 00:32:18.740
<v Speaker 5>You have this two way communication.</v>

1138
00:32:18.741 --> 00:32:20.750
<v Speaker 5>You're producing hundreds of videos,</v>

1139
00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:22.760
<v Speaker 5>you're pumping out hundreds of tweets.</v>

1140
00:32:22.970 --> 00:32:23.271
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

1141
00:32:23.271 --> 00:32:23.780
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1142
00:32:23.780 --> 00:32:24.160
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

1143
00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:25.310
<v Speaker 5>you take on a different role.</v>

1144
00:32:25.310 --> 00:32:25.360
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

1145
00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:27.700
<v Speaker 1>And you're super responsible in a way.</v>

1146
00:32:27.701 --> 00:32:27.941
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1147
00:32:27.941 --> 00:32:30.150
<v Speaker 1>say if you choose a certain phone,</v>

1148
00:32:30.190 --> 00:32:31.570
<v Speaker 1>it turns out to be a piece of shit.</v>

1149
00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:31.750
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

1150
00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:31.961
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1151
00:32:31.961 --> 00:32:36.961
<v Speaker 1>for sure the massive burden on you that would destroy to be unjustly.</v>

1152
00:32:37.301 --> 00:32:40.930
<v Speaker 1>Like there was no way it would be worth it because it would kind of like stain</v>

1153
00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:41.410
<v Speaker 1>you for it</v>

1154
00:32:41.410 --> 00:32:41.920
<v Speaker 5>ever.</v>

1155
00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:45.280
<v Speaker 5>Like your people's perceptions of your judgment and you know,</v>

1156
00:32:45.281 --> 00:32:46.720
<v Speaker 5>and most importantly if you're,</v>

1157
00:32:47.020 --> 00:32:49.030
<v Speaker 5>if you grew up invested in this,</v>

1158
00:32:49.090 --> 00:32:49.361
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1159
00:32:49.361 --> 00:32:52.630
<v Speaker 5>like I did like just wanting to get my hands on the next thing.</v>

1160
00:32:52.870 --> 00:32:53.410
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

1161
00:32:53.410 --> 00:32:54.910
<v Speaker 5>if you're actually excited,</v>

1162
00:32:54.940 --> 00:32:56.380
<v Speaker 5>it's super hard to fake it.</v>

1163
00:32:56.460 --> 00:32:57.190
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>

1164
00:32:57.190 --> 00:32:59.080
<v Speaker 5>It's a fake it eat one way or the other way.</v>

1165
00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:00.313
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

1166
00:33:00.340 --> 00:33:01.870
<v Speaker 5>there's something about the format,</v>

1167
00:33:01.900 --> 00:33:03.190
<v Speaker 5>the third party format,</v>

1168
00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:03.911
<v Speaker 5>like brands,</v>

1169
00:33:03.911 --> 00:33:07.570
<v Speaker 5>they'll put up their own videos without a feature video on your product.</v>

1170
00:33:07.571 --> 00:33:08.620
<v Speaker 5>Nobody wants that.</v>

1171
00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:13.920
<v Speaker 5>Nobody wants your super polished version of the way you want the thing to be</v>

1172
00:33:14.171 --> 00:33:15.004
<v Speaker 5>interpreted.</v>

1173
00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:16.330
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1174
00:33:16.330 --> 00:33:17.620
<v Speaker 5>in conversations I've had,</v>

1175
00:33:17.650 --> 00:33:18.550
<v Speaker 5>it's like I'm,</v>

1176
00:33:18.660 --> 00:33:21.220
<v Speaker 5>I'm playing the like unboxing videos in general.</v>

1177
00:33:21.221 --> 00:33:22.690
<v Speaker 5>I'm playing the role of view.</v>

1178
00:33:22.691 --> 00:33:24.700
<v Speaker 5>That's why traditionally they were shot point of view,</v>

1179
00:33:25.060 --> 00:33:26.800
<v Speaker 5>point of view because it's your head,</v>

1180
00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:28.390
<v Speaker 5>you're about to go experience this.</v>

1181
00:33:28.390 --> 00:33:31.030
<v Speaker 5>And when I was playing around with the Google Cardboard Vr,</v>

1182
00:33:31.031 --> 00:33:31.864
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

1183
00:33:32.020 --> 00:33:32.853
<v Speaker 5>Oh shit,</v>

1184
00:33:33.190 --> 00:33:38.190
<v Speaker 5>can you imagine this idea being expanded on of consumption through someone else?</v>

1185
00:33:40.010 --> 00:33:44.470
<v Speaker 5>Experience having experiences that will be unavailable to you through someone</v>

1186
00:33:44.471 --> 00:33:45.580
<v Speaker 5>else's perspective.</v>

1187
00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:49.630
<v Speaker 5>Because oftentimes I'm playing with items that people don't have the money to</v>

1188
00:33:49.631 --> 00:33:50.351
<v Speaker 5>buy and not,</v>

1189
00:33:50.351 --> 00:33:51.400
<v Speaker 5>at least not immediately.</v>

1190
00:33:51.700 --> 00:33:54.400
<v Speaker 5>They may be thinking about it or they may just be watching it for entertainment.</v>

1191
00:33:54.401 --> 00:33:55.600
<v Speaker 5>There's all kinds of different viewers,</v>

1192
00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:59.800
<v Speaker 5>but I can imagine being a kid really wanting something and the closest I could</v>

1193
00:33:59.801 --> 00:34:02.560
<v Speaker 5>get to it was that experience of getting it,</v>

1194
00:34:02.590 --> 00:34:07.090
<v Speaker 5>opening it Cetera and imagining that perspective of as being mine,</v>

1195
00:34:07.091 --> 00:34:07.720
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

1196
00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:12.370
<v Speaker 1>Well the unboxing videos are always very cool because you know you get to,</v>

1197
00:34:12.580 --> 00:34:15.790
<v Speaker 1>you get a real sense of the product like from,</v>

1198
00:34:15.910 --> 00:34:18.850
<v Speaker 1>from the purchase to your hands to discovering it.</v>

1199
00:34:19.090 --> 00:34:20.490
<v Speaker 1>Whereas like other times you like you,</v>

1200
00:34:20.491 --> 00:34:21.490
<v Speaker 1>the guy already has it out.</v>

1201
00:34:21.491 --> 00:34:22.750
<v Speaker 1>It's already each fully charged.</v>

1202
00:34:22.751 --> 00:34:23.080
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

1203
00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:24.070
<v Speaker 1>he knows how to work it.</v>

1204
00:34:24.071 --> 00:34:26.350
<v Speaker 1>So he's swiping back and forth and showing you all the things.</v>

1205
00:34:26.730 --> 00:34:31.120
<v Speaker 1>But you would never be able to talk a producer of a television show into letting</v>

1206
00:34:31.121 --> 00:34:34.780
<v Speaker 1>you film 20 minutes on a fucking new LG phone.</v>

1207
00:34:34.781 --> 00:34:35.231
<v Speaker 1>They would go,</v>

1208
00:34:35.231 --> 00:34:36.064
<v Speaker 1>no one's going to watch.</v>

1209
00:34:36.100 --> 00:34:36.880
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

1210
00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:37.430
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1211
00:34:37.430 --> 00:34:37.860
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

1212
00:34:37.860 --> 00:34:38.860
<v Speaker 5>I have heard of,</v>

1213
00:34:39.100 --> 00:34:40.630
<v Speaker 5>I think maybe it was virgin,</v>

1214
00:34:40.660 --> 00:34:41.411
<v Speaker 5>somebody put,</v>

1215
00:34:41.411 --> 00:34:44.050
<v Speaker 5>put some tech videos in the airplanes,</v>

1216
00:34:44.590 --> 00:34:46.220
<v Speaker 5>which were kind of extended in,</v>

1217
00:34:46.221 --> 00:34:47.054
<v Speaker 5>in length.</v>

1218
00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:48.130
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

1219
00:34:48.130 --> 00:34:49.630
<v Speaker 5>People would definitely watch them.</v>

1220
00:34:49.810 --> 00:34:50.860
<v Speaker 5>The world is changing.</v>

1221
00:34:50.861 --> 00:34:51.280
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1222
00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:52.061
<v Speaker 5>it's totally changed.</v>

1223
00:34:52.061 --> 00:34:53.500
<v Speaker 5>Those producers that are in that,</v>

1224
00:34:53.620 --> 00:34:54.431
<v Speaker 5>in that business,</v>

1225
00:34:54.431 --> 00:34:55.270
<v Speaker 5>in that world,</v>

1226
00:34:55.420 --> 00:34:56.860
<v Speaker 5>maybe they couldn't understand it,</v>

1227
00:34:57.220 --> 00:34:58.630
<v Speaker 5>but the audience and the numbers,</v>

1228
00:34:58.631 --> 00:34:59.464
<v Speaker 5>they don't lie.</v>

1229
00:34:59.680 --> 00:34:59.861
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1230
00:34:59.861 --> 00:35:01.930
<v Speaker 1>the content delivery device of television,</v>

1231
00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:05.470
<v Speaker 1>like Tara's going to be on at eight o'clock and can go from eight to nine and</v>

1232
00:35:05.471 --> 00:35:06.970
<v Speaker 1>that's when you gotta be there or Dvr it.</v>

1233
00:35:07.130 --> 00:35:07.910
<v Speaker 5>I have to,</v>

1234
00:35:07.910 --> 00:35:09.200
<v Speaker 5>I love this conversation.</v>

1235
00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:10.760
<v Speaker 5>I feel like it's not,</v>

1236
00:35:10.910 --> 00:35:13.280
<v Speaker 5>it's not us who need to be adapting to them.</v>

1237
00:35:13.281 --> 00:35:14.240
<v Speaker 5>It's them that need to be adapted</v>

1238
00:35:14.450 --> 00:35:14.870
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>

1239
00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:15.021
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1240
00:35:15.021 --> 00:35:16.130
<v Speaker 1>there's no need.</v>

1241
00:35:16.220 --> 00:35:21.220
<v Speaker 1>As technology has started to change what online video is and now you have like</v>

1242
00:35:21.291 --> 00:35:25.070
<v Speaker 1>Netflix documentaries and television shows and comedy specials.</v>

1243
00:35:25.170 --> 00:35:25.420
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

1244
00:35:25.420 --> 00:35:27.770
<v Speaker 1>What is the difference between something that's on Netflix and something that's</v>

1245
00:35:27.771 --> 00:35:28.490
<v Speaker 1>on television?</v>

1246
00:35:28.490 --> 00:35:29.323
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1247
00:35:29.420 --> 00:35:31.520
<v Speaker 1>it seems the same thing to me and that's,</v>

1248
00:35:31.660 --> 00:35:35.270
<v Speaker 1>it's becoming more and more prominent and it's going to get to a point where</v>

1249
00:35:35.390 --> 00:35:38.430
<v Speaker 1>it's going to eclipse it because they don't have the limitations</v>

1250
00:35:38.430 --> 00:35:40.380
<v Speaker 2>of you have to watch it this time.</v>

1251
00:35:40.381 --> 00:35:40.921
<v Speaker 2>It's only on,</v>

1252
00:35:40.921 --> 00:35:44.210
<v Speaker 2>then you've got to sit through commercials and all this silly limitation you're</v>

1253
00:35:44.211 --> 00:35:44.610
<v Speaker 2>dealing with,</v>

1254
00:35:44.610 --> 00:35:48.570
<v Speaker 5>with a more sophisticated delivery system and in the past,</v>

1255
00:35:48.750 --> 00:35:52.200
<v Speaker 5>sophisticated evolutions of systems are never held back.</v>

1256
00:35:52.201 --> 00:35:53.100
<v Speaker 5>You can't stop them.</v>

1257
00:35:53.101 --> 00:35:54.300
<v Speaker 5>You can try and like,</v>

1258
00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:55.830
<v Speaker 5>where's blockbuster?</v>

1259
00:35:56.010 --> 00:35:56.843
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1260
00:35:57.010 --> 00:35:57.670
<v Speaker 2>they fucked up.</v>

1261
00:35:57.670 --> 00:36:00.760
<v Speaker 2>There was a bunch of dudes sitting around a table like this with gray hair</v>

1262
00:36:00.910 --> 00:36:02.920
<v Speaker 2>saying people like to go and rent a movie.</v>

1263
00:36:02.921 --> 00:36:03.820
<v Speaker 2>You know it's an outing.</v>

1264
00:36:03.850 --> 00:36:05.060
<v Speaker 2>That's what they like to do.</v>

1265
00:36:05.061 --> 00:36:05.471
<v Speaker 2>Do it,</v>

1266
00:36:05.471 --> 00:36:06.760
<v Speaker 2>and then the wife gets to pick.</v>

1267
00:36:06.761 --> 00:36:07.570
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

1268
00:36:07.570 --> 00:36:08.041
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

1269
00:36:08.041 --> 00:36:11.710
<v Speaker 2>Each day that husband gets to pick on ones during tonight's mine.</v>

1270
00:36:11.711 --> 00:36:13.150
<v Speaker 2>I like the classics,</v>

1271
00:36:13.151 --> 00:36:13.841
<v Speaker 2>the classics.</v>

1272
00:36:13.841 --> 00:36:15.760
<v Speaker 2>For seven day rentals and late fees.</v>

1273
00:36:15.761 --> 00:36:16.720
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember late fees?</v>

1274
00:36:17.140 --> 00:36:19.660
<v Speaker 2>Can you believe that we put up with that shit?</v>

1275
00:36:19.690 --> 00:36:20.501
<v Speaker 2>I'll do you one better.</v>

1276
00:36:20.501 --> 00:36:21.820
<v Speaker 2>How about rewind fees?</v>

1277
00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:23.490
<v Speaker 5>Whoa.</v>

1278
00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:25.080
<v Speaker 5>Now I can't go with you there.</v>

1279
00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:26.310
<v Speaker 5>I can't get that far back.</v>

1280
00:36:26.750 --> 00:36:28.050
<v Speaker 2>Remember the rewind fees?</v>

1281
00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:29.061
<v Speaker 2>That was bullshit.</v>

1282
00:36:29.061 --> 00:36:32.240
<v Speaker 2>That was so you don't rewind and they're charging you and charge you money.</v>

1283
00:36:32.241 --> 00:36:33.460
<v Speaker 2>If you didn't roll on the ditch,</v>

1284
00:36:33.810 --> 00:36:34.670
<v Speaker 2>rewind the video.</v>

1285
00:36:34.671 --> 00:36:35.120
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

1286
00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:35.451
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

1287
00:36:35.451 --> 00:36:36.370
<v Speaker 2>I think I did.</v>

1288
00:36:36.390 --> 00:36:37.221
<v Speaker 2>And then they look at it.</v>

1289
00:36:37.221 --> 00:36:38.054
<v Speaker 2>No you didn't.</v>

1290
00:36:38.290 --> 00:36:40.490
<v Speaker 2>It's like who's considering user experience?</v>

1291
00:36:40.491 --> 00:36:41.121
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

1292
00:36:41.121 --> 00:36:42.770
<v Speaker 2>how about some customer service?</v>

1293
00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:43.281
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1294
00:36:43.281 --> 00:36:43.521
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1295
00:36:43.521 --> 00:36:46.820
<v Speaker 2>my friend figured out that most of the time the people that work at blockbuster</v>

1296
00:36:46.821 --> 00:36:51.110
<v Speaker 2>or way too dumb to know whether it's fully watched or fully rewound,</v>

1297
00:36:51.410 --> 00:36:52.640
<v Speaker 2>they would like look at it.</v>

1298
00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:57.440
<v Speaker 2>So what he would do is just fast forward it to the very end and then say it's,</v>

1299
00:36:57.441 --> 00:36:57.621
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1300
00:36:57.621 --> 00:36:58.400
<v Speaker 2>it's totally rewound.</v>

1301
00:36:58.400 --> 00:36:58.731
<v Speaker 2>They would go,</v>

1302
00:36:58.731 --> 00:36:58.901
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1303
00:36:58.901 --> 00:36:59.734
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1304
00:36:59.900 --> 00:37:02.130
<v Speaker 2>Because they didn't know if it was real loud,</v>

1305
00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:06.410
<v Speaker 2>couldn't where does it go like that?</v>

1306
00:37:06.770 --> 00:37:07.940
<v Speaker 2>Or is it like this?</v>

1307
00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:08.990
<v Speaker 2>Like where's,</v>

1308
00:37:08.990 --> 00:37:09.890
<v Speaker 2>which is the start?</v>

1309
00:37:10.010 --> 00:37:11.250
<v Speaker 2>Does it go clockwise?</v>

1310
00:37:11.251 --> 00:37:12.220
<v Speaker 2>Is it go okay?</v>

1311
00:37:13.260 --> 00:37:15.060
<v Speaker 5>Getting back to that conversation about the,</v>

1312
00:37:15.061 --> 00:37:15.570
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1313
00:37:15.570 --> 00:37:17.700
<v Speaker 5>about the internet as a delivery method.</v>

1314
00:37:17.990 --> 00:37:18.690
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1315
00:37:18.690 --> 00:37:19.231
<v Speaker 5>there's this,</v>

1316
00:37:19.231 --> 00:37:22.470
<v Speaker 5>this thing happening now we're online content creators with really large</v>

1317
00:37:22.471 --> 00:37:24.960
<v Speaker 5>audiences are getting approached by traditional media.</v>

1318
00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:25.261
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1319
00:37:25.261 --> 00:37:26.010
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

1320
00:37:26.010 --> 00:37:29.790
<v Speaker 5>they are wanting to bring them over into that world to try and generate some</v>

1321
00:37:29.791 --> 00:37:33.840
<v Speaker 5>interest in traditional media to an audience that generally isn't interested in</v>

1322
00:37:33.841 --> 00:37:34.674
<v Speaker 5>that content.</v>

1323
00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:35.950
<v Speaker 5>And the prob there's,</v>

1324
00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:39.750
<v Speaker 5>there's problems occurring where those people aren't translating and vice versa,</v>

1325
00:37:39.751 --> 00:37:41.790
<v Speaker 5>or they're trying to mold them into something else.</v>

1326
00:37:41.970 --> 00:37:45.510
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of really big content creators that have branched out in that way.</v>

1327
00:37:45.660 --> 00:37:47.820
<v Speaker 5>And there's some sort of feeling like once you've got,</v>

1328
00:37:47.821 --> 00:37:48.810
<v Speaker 5>once you're on TV,</v>

1329
00:37:48.811 --> 00:37:49.440
<v Speaker 5>you've made it,</v>

1330
00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:50.273
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1331
00:37:50.340 --> 00:37:52.980
<v Speaker 5>which is still appealing to a lot of people,</v>

1332
00:37:53.100 --> 00:37:53.730
<v Speaker 5>but not,</v>

1333
00:37:53.730 --> 00:37:56.310
<v Speaker 5>not at all for me because when I see it,</v>

1334
00:37:56.320 --> 00:37:56.790
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

1335
00:37:56.790 --> 00:37:57.750
<v Speaker 5>like I said before,</v>

1336
00:37:57.810 --> 00:38:01.650
<v Speaker 5>a more sophisticated delivery system I want for me,</v>

1337
00:38:01.940 --> 00:38:06.750
<v Speaker 5>we've won when we've convinced them that when we've convinced them to come work</v>

1338
00:38:06.751 --> 00:38:07.230
<v Speaker 5>with us,</v>

1339
00:38:07.230 --> 00:38:08.160
<v Speaker 5>not the other way around,</v>

1340
00:38:08.161 --> 00:38:08.880
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1341
00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:09.750
<v Speaker 5>and uh,</v>

1342
00:38:09.751 --> 00:38:11.820
<v Speaker 5>and I feel like there's a lot of people,</v>

1343
00:38:12.300 --> 00:38:16.350
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of people that are undermining how cool all of this is by taking</v>

1344
00:38:16.351 --> 00:38:18.870
<v Speaker 5>their services and saying and saying,</v>

1345
00:38:18.930 --> 00:38:19.350
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1346
00:38:19.350 --> 00:38:19.790
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to,</v>

1347
00:38:19.790 --> 00:38:22.590
<v Speaker 5>I'm not going to upload on my channel as much anymore because I have a show on</v>

1348
00:38:22.740 --> 00:38:26.730
<v Speaker 5>this channel or because I'm working with this brand or because I'm in</v>

1349
00:38:26.731 --> 00:38:27.541
<v Speaker 5>commercials now,</v>

1350
00:38:27.541 --> 00:38:28.170
<v Speaker 5>or whatever it is.</v>

1351
00:38:28.170 --> 00:38:29.480
<v Speaker 5>And that's a real thing that's happening.</v>

1352
00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:30.653
<v Speaker 2>Youtube stars.</v>

1353
00:38:30.930 --> 00:38:31.741
<v Speaker 2>That's fascinating.</v>

1354
00:38:31.741 --> 00:38:35.010
<v Speaker 2>So big youtube stars at getting lured into the dark side.</v>

1355
00:38:35.050 --> 00:38:35.700
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

1356
00:38:35.700 --> 00:38:36.550
<v Speaker 2>They pulled over.</v>

1357
00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:37.860
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

1358
00:38:37.860 --> 00:38:39.150
<v Speaker 2>Real control that content.</v>

1359
00:38:39.151 --> 00:38:40.840
<v Speaker 2>But that's right.</v>

1360
00:38:40.841 --> 00:38:41.770
<v Speaker 2>We'll give you pasted these</v>

1361
00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:45.670
<v Speaker 2>coins from the bottom of the mountain.</v>

1362
00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:52.080
<v Speaker 2>That is a real thing because their whole business is based around control.</v>

1363
00:38:52.450 --> 00:38:55.390
<v Speaker 2>They have to control the assets like record deals,</v>

1364
00:38:55.420 --> 00:38:56.800
<v Speaker 2>think about record deals,</v>

1365
00:38:56.830 --> 00:38:57.970
<v Speaker 2>music companies,</v>

1366
00:38:58.390 --> 00:38:59.890
<v Speaker 2>all that shit got overhauled.</v>

1367
00:39:00.070 --> 00:39:00.720
<v Speaker 2>Why heard does,</v>

1368
00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:02.320
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what podcast company it is,</v>

1369
00:39:02.321 --> 00:39:04.330
<v Speaker 2>but one of the podcast networks got sold.</v>

1370
00:39:04.810 --> 00:39:08.020
<v Speaker 2>It got sold to some radio conglomerate or some shit like that.</v>

1371
00:39:08.270 --> 00:39:09.160
<v Speaker 2>I remember when that happened.</v>

1372
00:39:09.161 --> 00:39:09.551
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1373
00:39:09.551 --> 00:39:09.970
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

1374
00:39:09.970 --> 00:39:10.661
<v Speaker 2>that's weird.</v>

1375
00:39:10.661 --> 00:39:13.000
<v Speaker 2>Why would they want to buy a podcast network?</v>

1376
00:39:13.260 --> 00:39:14.220
<v Speaker 2>Nerdous it.</v>

1377
00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:18.370
<v Speaker 2>Then they get bought by a like Warner brothers or some kind of form a Warner</v>

1378
00:39:18.371 --> 00:39:19.000
<v Speaker 2>brothers.</v>

1379
00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:20.200
<v Speaker 2>Find out what the actual,</v>

1380
00:39:20.260 --> 00:39:20.471
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1381
00:39:20.471 --> 00:39:21.010
<v Speaker 2>who cares?</v>

1382
00:39:21.010 --> 00:39:23.050
<v Speaker 2>I mean I let him do whatever he wants to do.</v>

1383
00:39:23.140 --> 00:39:23.620
<v Speaker 2>I've had,</v>

1384
00:39:23.620 --> 00:39:25.300
<v Speaker 2>I've had offers to buy my channel.</v>

1385
00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:28.780
<v Speaker 2>Really sell that with pursed lips and that's right.</v>

1386
00:39:29.020 --> 00:39:31.180
<v Speaker 2>You said that very in serious tones.</v>

1387
00:39:31.181 --> 00:39:31.840
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

1388
00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:32.081
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1389
00:39:32.081 --> 00:39:32.381
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1390
00:39:32.381 --> 00:39:32.591
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1391
00:39:32.591 --> 00:39:33.640
<v Speaker 2>it's worth a lot of money.</v>

1392
00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:35.320
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people are checking it out.</v>

1393
00:39:35.321 --> 00:39:37.000
<v Speaker 2>We can just change the way you look at things.</v>

1394
00:39:37.001 --> 00:39:37.361
<v Speaker 2>Louis,</v>

1395
00:39:37.361 --> 00:39:38.470
<v Speaker 2>you just a little too critical.</v>

1396
00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:39.040
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1397
00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:42.490
<v Speaker 2>why are you so mean when it comes to certain devices that could generate</v>

1398
00:39:42.491 --> 00:39:47.491
<v Speaker 2>millions of dollars if you just flavored your came imagined that life being that</v>

1399
00:39:48.190 --> 00:39:50.650
<v Speaker 2>person though really just a shell,</v>

1400
00:39:50.651 --> 00:39:51.280
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1401
00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:51.581
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1402
00:39:51.581 --> 00:39:52.420
<v Speaker 2>it's also,</v>

1403
00:39:52.830 --> 00:39:55.570
<v Speaker 2>it's completely contrary to what you're passionate about.</v>

1404
00:39:55.571 --> 00:39:57.250
<v Speaker 2>What you're passionate about is innovation.</v>

1405
00:39:57.251 --> 00:39:59.380
<v Speaker 2>Where you're passionate about is the consumer experience.</v>

1406
00:39:59.530 --> 00:40:01.540
<v Speaker 2>Like I was kind of a really interested,</v>

1407
00:40:01.541 --> 00:40:03.670
<v Speaker 2>or the last conversation that we had you,</v>

1408
00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:06.760
<v Speaker 2>you were talking about the user experience,</v>

1409
00:40:06.761 --> 00:40:07.630
<v Speaker 2>the UAE,</v>

1410
00:40:07.660 --> 00:40:10.030
<v Speaker 2>which I had never really thought of as a concept,</v>

1411
00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:10.980
<v Speaker 2>but it is,</v>

1412
00:40:10.980 --> 00:40:12.640
<v Speaker 2>it's not just a user interface,</v>

1413
00:40:12.730 --> 00:40:13.540
<v Speaker 2>but it's the experience.</v>

1414
00:40:13.540 --> 00:40:16.060
<v Speaker 2>How does it make you feel to finish beveled edges,</v>

1415
00:40:16.830 --> 00:40:19.390
<v Speaker 2>the Polish Smith last box that it comes in.</v>

1416
00:40:19.391 --> 00:40:19.931
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1417
00:40:19.931 --> 00:40:21.070
<v Speaker 2>What is all that about?</v>

1418
00:40:21.071 --> 00:40:25.900
<v Speaker 2>And that's something that you only would sort of get if you are truly passionate</v>

1419
00:40:25.930 --> 00:40:27.040
<v Speaker 2>about this.</v>

1420
00:40:27.070 --> 00:40:28.030
<v Speaker 2>Let's look at Apple.</v>

1421
00:40:28.031 --> 00:40:28.630
<v Speaker 2>I mean they,</v>

1422
00:40:28.630 --> 00:40:30.130
<v Speaker 2>they're trying to control the experience.</v>

1423
00:40:30.131 --> 00:40:32.020
<v Speaker 2>Start to finish from the retail perspective.</v>

1424
00:40:32.470 --> 00:40:35.350
<v Speaker 2>There's a difference between walking into an apple store in a Verizon store.</v>

1425
00:40:35.470 --> 00:40:35.801
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1426
00:40:35.801 --> 00:40:36.280
<v Speaker 2>The apple,</v>

1427
00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:37.120
<v Speaker 2>they've got it nailed.</v>

1428
00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:38.380
<v Speaker 2>They do have that nail.</v>

1429
00:40:38.381 --> 00:40:38.561
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

1430
00:40:38.561 --> 00:40:39.580
<v Speaker 2>everything looks apple.</v>

1431
00:40:39.581 --> 00:40:40.414
<v Speaker 2>Lee,</v>

1432
00:40:40.450 --> 00:40:40.841
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1433
00:40:40.841 --> 00:40:41.860
<v Speaker 2>you go into the apple store,</v>

1434
00:40:41.861 --> 00:40:42.750
<v Speaker 2>it's totally APP.</v>

1435
00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:47.800
<v Speaker 2>I feel like we shouldn't go off on apple talk again because people get suck.</v>

1436
00:40:47.801 --> 00:40:48.840
<v Speaker 2>It sucks.</v>

1437
00:40:48.860 --> 00:40:49.511
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

1438
00:40:49.511 --> 00:40:51.880
<v Speaker 2>The reality is that they make the best laptops.</v>

1439
00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:53.470
<v Speaker 2>They make the best desktops,</v>

1440
00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:54.730
<v Speaker 2>they make the best phones.</v>

1441
00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:56.160
<v Speaker 2>They just do that.</v>

1442
00:40:56.161 --> 00:40:57.250
<v Speaker 2>The android phones,</v>

1443
00:40:57.310 --> 00:41:01.090
<v Speaker 2>the best thing about the android phones is that they're open is that anybody</v>

1444
00:41:01.091 --> 00:41:02.560
<v Speaker 2>could make things for them.</v>

1445
00:41:02.590 --> 00:41:04.180
<v Speaker 2>Is that the screens are bigger,</v>

1446
00:41:04.210 --> 00:41:04.811
<v Speaker 2>is that,</v>

1447
00:41:04.811 --> 00:41:05.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1448
00:41:05.410 --> 00:41:07.210
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot that you could watch flash on them.</v>

1449
00:41:07.211 --> 00:41:09.970
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of really positives when it comes to android phones,</v>

1450
00:41:10.150 --> 00:41:14.080
<v Speaker 2>but when it comes to like who has made an android phone that can fuck with an</v>

1451
00:41:14.081 --> 00:41:14.530
<v Speaker 2>iPhone,</v>

1452
00:41:14.530 --> 00:41:18.280
<v Speaker 2>the closest is like that HTC m eight and I've had that.</v>

1453
00:41:18.910 --> 00:41:21.090
<v Speaker 2>It's good on camera.</v>

1454
00:41:21.130 --> 00:41:21.820
<v Speaker 2>You see one?</v>

1455
00:41:21.820 --> 00:41:21.971
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1456
00:41:21.971 --> 00:41:22.480
<v Speaker 2>it's good.</v>

1457
00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:23.740
<v Speaker 2>Actually me and mark has to be,</v>

1458
00:41:23.741 --> 00:41:27.010
<v Speaker 2>did an inadvertent camera test out the window of our hotel.</v>

1459
00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:28.533
<v Speaker 2>We'd check in.</v>

1460
00:41:28.690 --> 00:41:29.411
<v Speaker 2>He's three,</v>

1461
00:41:29.411 --> 00:41:30.640
<v Speaker 2>four floors above me,</v>

1462
00:41:30.970 --> 00:41:35.300
<v Speaker 2>so I'm 12 he's 15 we both the exact same photo unknowingly.</v>

1463
00:41:35.810 --> 00:41:37.820
<v Speaker 2>I use a five s he uses the MH,</v>

1464
00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:39.020
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

1465
00:41:39.020 --> 00:41:42.080
<v Speaker 2>and we both post to Instagram sec within seconds of each other.</v>

1466
00:41:42.310 --> 00:41:46.490
<v Speaker 2>Izea mine go live and right underneath I see his and you should check out.</v>

00:41:46.580 --> 00:41:47.413
<v Speaker 2>I'll show you the results.</v>

1468
00:41:48.190 --> 00:41:48.530
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1469
00:41:48.530 --> 00:41:51.230
<v Speaker 2>I've seen a bunch of the results from videos like Marcus's,</v>

1470
00:41:51.740 --> 00:41:52.573
<v Speaker 2>I'll show you the results.</v>

1471
00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:53.570
<v Speaker 2>It's obvious.</v>

1472
00:41:53.570 --> 00:41:55.460
<v Speaker 2>The iPhones have a better camera.</v>

1473
00:41:55.461 --> 00:41:56.121
<v Speaker 2>It's a better,</v>

1474
00:41:56.121 --> 00:41:57.800
<v Speaker 2>it's a slicker design.</v>

1475
00:41:57.830 --> 00:41:58.101
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1476
00:41:58.101 --> 00:41:59.390
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of great things to it,</v>

1477
00:41:59.391 --> 00:41:59.961
<v Speaker 2>but damn,</v>

1478
00:41:59.961 --> 00:42:00.794
<v Speaker 2>Android's fucker.</v>

1479
00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:01.640
<v Speaker 2>It's close.</v>

1480
00:42:01.670 --> 00:42:02.180
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1481
00:42:02.180 --> 00:42:03.080
<v Speaker 2>so really cool.</v>

1482
00:42:03.081 --> 00:42:03.914
<v Speaker 2>Check this out.</v>

1483
00:42:04.070 --> 00:42:05.660
<v Speaker 2>Just scroll down to the next one.</v>

1484
00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:08.030
<v Speaker 2>That's the iPhone five s on the top.</v>

1485
00:42:09.340 --> 00:42:09.860
<v Speaker 2>We took,</v>

1486
00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:11.630
<v Speaker 2>we essentially took the St and then scroll down.</v>

1487
00:42:11.690 --> 00:42:12.110
<v Speaker 2>God.</v>

1488
00:42:12.110 --> 00:42:12.943
<v Speaker 2>And that's the man.</v>

1489
00:42:12.980 --> 00:42:13.820
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

1490
00:42:13.850 --> 00:42:15.080
<v Speaker 2>That's incredibly different.</v>

1491
00:42:15.830 --> 00:42:16.860
<v Speaker 2>Look at all the devotees.</v>

1492
00:42:16.861 --> 00:42:19.520
<v Speaker 2>It's not at the same time because the sun is different than the horizon.</v>

1493
00:42:19.580 --> 00:42:19.821
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1494
00:42:19.821 --> 00:42:20.420
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

1495
00:42:20.420 --> 00:42:20.721
<v Speaker 2>come on.</v>

1496
00:42:20.721 --> 00:42:21.380
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

1497
00:42:21.380 --> 00:42:23.180
<v Speaker 2>That's within seconds of one another.</v>

1498
00:42:23.420 --> 00:42:24.253
<v Speaker 2>That's insane.</v>

1499
00:42:24.410 --> 00:42:25.160
<v Speaker 2>Look at the deed.</v>

1500
00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:25.940
<v Speaker 2>How come yours?</v>

1501
00:42:25.940 --> 00:42:26.611
<v Speaker 2>Like look at you.</v>

1502
00:42:26.611 --> 00:42:27.620
<v Speaker 2>You'd see your son.</v>

1503
00:42:27.830 --> 00:42:29.900
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't show any like black.</v>

1504
00:42:29.930 --> 00:42:31.850
<v Speaker 2>What does that the bill flare.</v>

1505
00:42:31.970 --> 00:42:32.870
<v Speaker 2>The flare flare.</v>

1506
00:42:32.930 --> 00:42:33.860
<v Speaker 2>But look at his flair.</v>

1507
00:42:33.980 --> 00:42:34.430
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

1508
00:42:34.430 --> 00:42:35.030
<v Speaker 2>And look at,</v>

1509
00:42:35.030 --> 00:42:37.910
<v Speaker 2>the interesting part for me is if you scroll down a little more and you look in</v>

1510
00:42:37.911 --> 00:42:39.140
<v Speaker 2>the shadow portion,</v>

1511
00:42:39.860 --> 00:42:41.930
<v Speaker 2>there's no detail in the MH shadows.</v>

1512
00:42:41.970 --> 00:42:42.803
<v Speaker 2>It's terrible.</v>

1513
00:42:42.910 --> 00:42:43.730
<v Speaker 2>It was like shit.</v>

1514
00:42:43.730 --> 00:42:44.511
<v Speaker 2>You go up to the mind,</v>

1515
00:42:44.511 --> 00:42:47.960
<v Speaker 2>look at the detail where the cars are parked and that building in the forefront.</v>

1516
00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:48.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1517
00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:52.490
<v Speaker 2>That is fascinating that you guys did that accidentally and then yeah,</v>

1518
00:42:52.491 --> 00:42:53.040
<v Speaker 2>because it,</v>

1519
00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:54.520
<v Speaker 2>it just goes to show you like the,</v>

1520
00:42:55.130 --> 00:42:55.970
<v Speaker 2>the mindset,</v>

1521
00:42:56.270 --> 00:42:56.601
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1522
00:42:56.601 --> 00:42:59.600
<v Speaker 2>like we both saw the cool shot where like I'm going to take the shot and,</v>

1523
00:42:59.770 --> 00:43:01.130
<v Speaker 2>and the difference in the output.</v>

1524
00:43:01.190 --> 00:43:02.023
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1525
00:43:02.180 --> 00:43:05.900
<v Speaker 2>This sort of the context of the user experience,</v>

1526
00:43:05.901 --> 00:43:06.171
<v Speaker 2>like the,</v>

1527
00:43:06.171 --> 00:43:07.130
<v Speaker 2>the passionate,</v>

1528
00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:07.993
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1529
00:43:08.090 --> 00:43:12.260
<v Speaker 2>a person who's into a electronics that can't,</v>

1530
00:43:12.261 --> 00:43:13.094
<v Speaker 2>you can't fake that.</v>

1531
00:43:13.100 --> 00:43:13.933
<v Speaker 2>You can't know.</v>

1532
00:43:14.050 --> 00:43:14.883
<v Speaker 2>It is,</v>

1533
00:43:15.050 --> 00:43:16.070
<v Speaker 2>that's why it's so hard.</v>

1534
00:43:16.100 --> 00:43:19.970
<v Speaker 2>There are so many users or guys like us that really,</v>

1535
00:43:19.971 --> 00:43:22.070
<v Speaker 2>really like the interface on stock.</v>

1536
00:43:22.071 --> 00:43:23.660
<v Speaker 2>Android like we talked about last time,</v>

1537
00:43:23.990 --> 00:43:26.690
<v Speaker 2>I have a nexus with me as well pretty much all the time.</v>

1538
00:43:26.691 --> 00:43:30.620
<v Speaker 2>But it's so hard to ditch the iPhone because when you want to make a photo,</v>

1539
00:43:30.621 --> 00:43:32.570
<v Speaker 2>when you want to communicate through photography,</v>

1540
00:43:32.870 --> 00:43:36.170
<v Speaker 2>there's just no other way right now and not theirs.</v>

1541
00:43:36.620 --> 00:43:39.920
<v Speaker 2>That's Sony one that takes very high mag and the one that has the extra,</v>

1542
00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:41.710
<v Speaker 2>extra big fat land.</v>

1543
00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:42.520
<v Speaker 2>The Nokia one,</v>

1544
00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:43.140
<v Speaker 2>there's no,</v>

1545
00:43:43.140 --> 00:43:43.850
<v Speaker 2>that's what it is.</v>

1546
00:43:43.850 --> 00:43:45.290
<v Speaker 2>Is there a Sony that has that as well?</v>

1547
00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:48.380
<v Speaker 2>The Sony's have some great cameras to Sony is a waterproof one.</v>

1548
00:43:48.381 --> 00:43:48.650
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1549
00:43:48.650 --> 00:43:49.550
<v Speaker 2>That's to have a waterproof,</v>

1550
00:43:49.551 --> 00:43:50.690
<v Speaker 2>totally waterproof phone.</v>

1551
00:43:50.870 --> 00:43:51.703
<v Speaker 2>Definitely.</v>

1552
00:43:51.860 --> 00:43:53.030
<v Speaker 2>Why is this not waterproof?</v>

1553
00:43:54.260 --> 00:43:55.090
<v Speaker 2>That's a good question.</v>

1554
00:43:55.090 --> 00:43:58.400
<v Speaker 2>That's a stupid back back when back then,</v>

1555
00:43:58.430 --> 00:43:59.080
<v Speaker 2>like when the,</v>

1556
00:43:59.080 --> 00:43:59.871
<v Speaker 2>this really hasn't,</v>

1557
00:43:59.871 --> 00:44:01.990
<v Speaker 2>the body hasn't changed much since the five right?</v>

1558
00:44:02.030 --> 00:44:03.560
<v Speaker 2>Back then it really wasn't a thing.</v>

1559
00:44:03.650 --> 00:44:04.580
<v Speaker 2>People weren't making it.</v>

1560
00:44:04.581 --> 00:44:05.000
<v Speaker 2>It just,</v>

1561
00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:06.230
<v Speaker 2>it's relatively recent.</v>

1562
00:44:06.260 --> 00:44:09.800
<v Speaker 2>Samsung's is a IP rated for dust and water.</v>

1563
00:44:10.070 --> 00:44:10.280
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1564
00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:10.940
<v Speaker 2>so is,</v>

1565
00:44:10.940 --> 00:44:12.020
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if HTCs is,</v>

1566
00:44:12.021 --> 00:44:13.400
<v Speaker 2>but definitely Sony's is,</v>

1567
00:44:13.610 --> 00:44:15.320
<v Speaker 2>it's a relatively new thing that that's happening.</v>

1568
00:44:15.321 --> 00:44:15.771
<v Speaker 2>They can go like,</v>

1569
00:44:15.771 --> 00:44:15.951
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1570
00:44:15.951 --> 00:44:17.480
<v Speaker 2>a meter underwater for 10 minutes.</v>

1571
00:44:18.790 --> 00:44:19.190
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

1572
00:44:19.190 --> 00:44:21.470
<v Speaker 2>the next one might be the next one might be,</v>

1573
00:44:21.650 --> 00:44:22.191
<v Speaker 2>but it's not,</v>

1574
00:44:22.191 --> 00:44:23.180
<v Speaker 2>it's for them.</v>

1575
00:44:23.300 --> 00:44:24.620
<v Speaker 2>That's not a huge priority.</v>

1576
00:44:24.850 --> 00:44:25.190
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>

1577
00:44:25.190 --> 00:44:26.630
<v Speaker 2>this doesn't seem like a huge product.</v>

1578
00:44:26.900 --> 00:44:29.810
<v Speaker 2>Everybody gets their phone ruined by pouring a drink on it.</v>

1579
00:44:29.870 --> 00:44:31.950
<v Speaker 2>Like that's the number one reason phones get ruined.</v>

1580
00:44:32.670 --> 00:44:33.930
<v Speaker 5>I would say cracked screens.</v>

1581
00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:34.560
<v Speaker 5>Toilet,</v>

1582
00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:37.380
<v Speaker 5>I would take cracked screens are probably higher than water,</v>

1583
00:44:37.500 --> 00:44:40.350
<v Speaker 5>but they're both high speeding of cracked screens.</v>

1584
00:44:40.710 --> 00:44:41.370
<v Speaker 5>Cracked screens.</v>

1585
00:44:41.370 --> 00:44:42.121
<v Speaker 5>Almost universal,</v>

1586
00:44:42.121 --> 00:44:42.440
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

1587
00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:44.100
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't everybody get a cracked screen of,</v>

1588
00:44:44.101 --> 00:44:44.970
<v Speaker 5>I've never had one,</v>

1589
00:44:45.030 --> 00:44:47.360
<v Speaker 5>but I've had to move a Turd to get my phone out of,</v>

1590
00:44:47.610 --> 00:44:48.443
<v Speaker 5>out of the toilet.</v>

1591
00:44:48.840 --> 00:44:50.130
<v Speaker 5>Did you kill the phone or the phone?</v>

1592
00:44:50.150 --> 00:44:51.420
<v Speaker 5>Survive phones or vive.</v>

1593
00:44:51.750 --> 00:44:51.980
<v Speaker 5>How,</v>

1594
00:44:51.980 --> 00:44:52.920
<v Speaker 5>how long was it English?</v>

1595
00:44:54.150 --> 00:44:58.320
<v Speaker 5>It literally like I got up and then it fell in the toilet and I was like,</v>

1596
00:44:58.321 --> 00:45:00.660
<v Speaker 5>God put my hand through her and grabbed it,</v>

1597
00:45:00.661 --> 00:45:02.430
<v Speaker 5>pulled it out and then,</v>

1598
00:45:02.550 --> 00:45:03.440
<v Speaker 5>and then uh,</v>

1599
00:45:03.980 --> 00:45:04.810
<v Speaker 5>write it off,</v>

1600
00:45:04.810 --> 00:45:07.740
<v Speaker 5>put it in a bag of rice now he didn't even wash his hands as fuck.</v>

1601
00:45:07.741 --> 00:45:07.890
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

1602
00:45:07.890 --> 00:45:10.890
<v Speaker 5>Now I did the shaky thing and it's good enough though.</v>

1603
00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:11.993
<v Speaker 5>Hairdryer.</v>

1604
00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:12.720
<v Speaker 5>Oh really?</v>

1605
00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:16.440
<v Speaker 5>What you should do if that happens is 24 hours in a bag of rice.</v>

1606
00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:17.110
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1607
00:45:17.110 --> 00:45:17.580
<v Speaker 5>It'll,</v>

1608
00:45:17.580 --> 00:45:19.440
<v Speaker 5>it'll pull away where the moisture would.</v>

1609
00:45:19.441 --> 00:45:20.600
<v Speaker 5>I usually ended up just doing it,</v>

1610
00:45:20.670 --> 00:45:24.810
<v Speaker 5>then having something stopped working and then take it to the APP or call the</v>

1611
00:45:24.811 --> 00:45:27.360
<v Speaker 5>apple store and they will send you one with that.</v>

1612
00:45:27.630 --> 00:45:28.590
<v Speaker 5>Apple's great with that.</v>

1613
00:45:28.830 --> 00:45:30.180
<v Speaker 5>Here's the weird things though.</v>

1614
00:45:30.181 --> 00:45:30.780
<v Speaker 5>They put,</v>

1615
00:45:30.780 --> 00:45:31.680
<v Speaker 5>or at least they used to,</v>

1616
00:45:31.681 --> 00:45:32.280
<v Speaker 5>I don't know anymore.</v>

1617
00:45:32.280 --> 00:45:34.710
<v Speaker 5>I used to do like some repairs on these things,</v>

1618
00:45:34.711 --> 00:45:36.420
<v Speaker 5>crack them open and get crazy like that,</v>

1619
00:45:36.421 --> 00:45:40.500
<v Speaker 5>but they used to put little litmus paper in there that would show if it got wet</v>

1620
00:45:40.540 --> 00:45:41.400
<v Speaker 5>every turn red.</v>

1621
00:45:41.490 --> 00:45:42.720
<v Speaker 5>He used to be in the headphone Jack.</v>

1622
00:45:42.750 --> 00:45:43.141
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

1623
00:45:43.141 --> 00:45:44.380
<v Speaker 5>They probably are still doing it.</v>

1624
00:45:44.450 --> 00:45:45.283
<v Speaker 5>He's still do it,</v>

1625
00:45:45.610 --> 00:45:47.160
<v Speaker 5>but if you call they don't,</v>

1626
00:45:47.490 --> 00:45:48.420
<v Speaker 5>there's no way from the check.</v>

1627
00:45:48.880 --> 00:45:49.713
<v Speaker 5>Here's a question.</v>

1628
00:45:49.740 --> 00:45:52.100
<v Speaker 5>When you say if you drop something in the toilet,</v>

1629
00:45:52.120 --> 00:45:52.940
<v Speaker 5>you drop the phone in the truck,</v>

1630
00:45:52.940 --> 00:45:55.230
<v Speaker 5>should you shut it off and throw it in the bag of rice?</v>

1631
00:45:55.470 --> 00:45:55.561
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1632
00:45:55.561 --> 00:45:56.700
<v Speaker 5>should you leave at all times?</v>

1633
00:45:56.701 --> 00:45:57.870
<v Speaker 5>It turns itself off.</v>

1634
00:45:57.900 --> 00:45:58.501
<v Speaker 5>But yeah,</v>

1635
00:45:58.501 --> 00:45:58.801
<v Speaker 5>if you,</v>

1636
00:45:58.801 --> 00:45:59.890
<v Speaker 5>if it's still on to turn it,</v>

1637
00:45:59.940 --> 00:46:00.773
<v Speaker 5>turn it off,</v>

1638
00:46:00.810 --> 00:46:01.643
<v Speaker 5>shut it off,</v>

1639
00:46:01.860 --> 00:46:02.693
<v Speaker 5>shut it off,</v>

1640
00:46:03.030 --> 00:46:03.990
<v Speaker 5>throw it in the bag of rice.</v>

1641
00:46:03.991 --> 00:46:04.824
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1642
00:46:04.830 --> 00:46:07.290
<v Speaker 5>What I usually do is just suck the water out of it.</v>

1643
00:46:08.530 --> 00:46:08.790
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>

1644
00:46:08.790 --> 00:46:09.320
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

1645
00:46:09.320 --> 00:46:09.660
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

1646
00:46:09.660 --> 00:46:11.250
<v Speaker 5>but I wasn't going to do it with the poop ones,</v>

1647
00:46:11.310 --> 00:46:11.720
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1648
00:46:11.720 --> 00:46:12.120
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1649
00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:12.953
<v Speaker 5>Why not?</v>

1650
00:46:15.320 --> 00:46:16.560
<v Speaker 5>It's gross because when you suck it up,</v>

1651
00:46:16.561 --> 00:46:17.520
<v Speaker 5>if you look at your iPhone,</v>

1652
00:46:17.521 --> 00:46:19.320
<v Speaker 5>like there's the top part where the,</v>

1653
00:46:19.350 --> 00:46:20.183
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

1654
00:46:20.670 --> 00:46:22.140
<v Speaker 5>where your ear usually goes,</v>

1655
00:46:22.380 --> 00:46:23.730
<v Speaker 5>but there's water that's in there.</v>

1656
00:46:23.731 --> 00:46:26.730
<v Speaker 5>So you stuck that and you're like pretty much sucking earwax.</v>

1657
00:46:26.731 --> 00:46:27.564
<v Speaker 5>It's gross.</v>

1658
00:46:27.720 --> 00:46:28.320
<v Speaker 5>I never,</v>

1659
00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:31.620
<v Speaker 5>I never thought of on my phone ever jump into that.</v>

1660
00:46:31.640 --> 00:46:34.500
<v Speaker 5>You mean like I go like really hard many times.</v>

1661
00:46:34.501 --> 00:46:35.191
<v Speaker 5>Have you done this?</v>

1662
00:46:35.191 --> 00:46:36.330
<v Speaker 5>Probably like five times.</v>

1663
00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:37.320
<v Speaker 5>So where's your phone?</v>

1664
00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:41.550
<v Speaker 5>Where's your ear going that you're getting ear wax on them?</v>

1665
00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:42.160
<v Speaker 5>If you look,</v>

1666
00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:42.661
<v Speaker 5>if you look,</v>

1667
00:46:42.661 --> 00:46:45.960
<v Speaker 5>there's like a little grill that's right there and if you look really close,</v>

1668
00:46:45.961 --> 00:46:47.490
<v Speaker 5>you could actually see their shit in there.</v>

1669
00:46:47.610 --> 00:46:49.710
<v Speaker 5>I was thinking about the Jack itself.</v>

1670
00:46:49.800 --> 00:46:51.870
<v Speaker 5>I know you have to suck all of them.</v>

1671
00:46:51.871 --> 00:46:54.720
<v Speaker 5>There's the bottom one that you suck and you suck that power.</v>

1672
00:46:55.320 --> 00:46:56.070
<v Speaker 5>Does that work?</v>

1673
00:46:56.070 --> 00:46:57.480
<v Speaker 5>Can you really suck the water out?</v>

1674
00:46:57.481 --> 00:46:57.631
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1675
00:46:57.631 --> 00:46:58.260
<v Speaker 5>it really helps.</v>

1676
00:46:58.260 --> 00:46:59.040
<v Speaker 5>It's what I've always done.</v>

1677
00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:00.210
<v Speaker 5>You mean getting,</v>

1678
00:47:00.211 --> 00:47:03.480
<v Speaker 5>getting water away from it is going to be a positive thing,</v>

1679
00:47:05.330 --> 00:47:06.960
<v Speaker 5>but the guy on the phone,</v>

1680
00:47:08.820 --> 00:47:10.080
<v Speaker 5>customer service here,</v>

1681
00:47:10.430 --> 00:47:10.770
<v Speaker 5>Dude,</v>

1682
00:47:10.770 --> 00:47:11.603
<v Speaker 5>listen,</v>

1683
00:47:11.820 --> 00:47:13.320
<v Speaker 5>I've been sucking on my phones.</v>

1684
00:47:13.321 --> 00:47:13.830
<v Speaker 5>That cool.</v>

1685
00:47:13.830 --> 00:47:16.620
<v Speaker 5>I'm just taking it in the most polite way possible.</v>

1686
00:47:16.621 --> 00:47:17.490
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't recommend it.</v>

1687
00:47:17.491 --> 00:47:17.940
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

1688
00:47:17.940 --> 00:47:19.320
<v Speaker 5>Here's the answer to our other question.</v>

1689
00:47:19.321 --> 00:47:23.010
<v Speaker 5>1.7% of American adults identify as gay or lesbian.</v>

1690
00:47:23.550 --> 00:47:28.550
<v Speaker 5>1.7 C I had heard 10% that's the gays.</v>

1691
00:47:29.380 --> 00:47:30.010
<v Speaker 5>They just want you to</v>

1692
00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:30.880
<v Speaker 2>think that everyone's gay,</v>

1693
00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:31.451
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1694
00:47:31.451 --> 00:47:31.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1695
00:47:31.870 --> 00:47:32.151
<v Speaker 2>God.</v>

1696
00:47:32.151 --> 00:47:32.470
<v Speaker 2>Damn.</v>

1697
00:47:32.470 --> 00:47:33.700
<v Speaker 2>Tough stat to get though.</v>

1698
00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:35.433
<v Speaker 2>Who's taking that?</v>

1699
00:47:35.490 --> 00:47:36.400
<v Speaker 2>It's a good question.</v>

1700
00:47:36.910 --> 00:47:41.230
<v Speaker 2>It's a really good question because what percentage of gays are in the closet</v>

1701
00:47:41.231 --> 00:47:42.010
<v Speaker 2>versus out?</v>

1702
00:47:42.010 --> 00:47:43.090
<v Speaker 2>That's a good question.</v>

1703
00:47:44.380 --> 00:47:45.213
<v Speaker 2>I would wonder,</v>

1704
00:47:45.550 --> 00:47:47.650
<v Speaker 2>what do you think again,</v>

1705
00:47:47.651 --> 00:47:48.880
<v Speaker 2>impossible stat to get.</v>

1706
00:47:49.150 --> 00:47:51.090
<v Speaker 2>I would say 50 50 yeah.</v>

1707
00:47:51.220 --> 00:47:53.630
<v Speaker 3>Just take 20 friends that you know and then think,</v>

1708
00:47:53.631 --> 00:47:53.831
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

1709
00:47:53.831 --> 00:47:55.360
<v Speaker 3>how many of those 20 people are gay?</v>

1710
00:47:55.390 --> 00:47:56.230
<v Speaker 3>How many people are those?</v>

1711
00:47:56.231 --> 00:47:57.340
<v Speaker 3>Do you think are in the closet?</v>

1712
00:47:57.341 --> 00:47:58.174
<v Speaker 3>How many?</v>

1713
00:47:58.570 --> 00:48:00.100
<v Speaker 3>Just like how it tastes.</v>

1714
00:48:00.430 --> 00:48:02.110
<v Speaker 2>We all know a few people that are in the closet.</v>

1715
00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:02.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1716
00:48:02.590 --> 00:48:03.423
<v Speaker 2>Everybody goes,</v>

1717
00:48:03.470 --> 00:48:04.303
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1718
00:48:05.140 --> 00:48:07.690
<v Speaker 2>in public figures to speculate on.</v>

1719
00:48:07.720 --> 00:48:08.740
<v Speaker 2>It's really sad.</v>

1720
00:48:09.100 --> 00:48:11.200
<v Speaker 2>It's sad when someone was in the closet.</v>

1721
00:48:11.360 --> 00:48:15.160
<v Speaker 2>Do you know when you got a guy who's a friend like Justin Martin Dale who's out</v>

1722
00:48:15.161 --> 00:48:17.170
<v Speaker 2>and happy and silly about it,</v>

1723
00:48:17.680 --> 00:48:18.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1724
00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:19.300
<v Speaker 2>and nobody judges them.</v>

1725
00:48:19.301 --> 00:48:22.810
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's no different than judging someone who,</v>

1726
00:48:22.840 --> 00:48:23.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1727
00:48:23.620 --> 00:48:25.390
<v Speaker 2>likes to drive a certain kind of car.</v>

1728
00:48:25.391 --> 00:48:26.224
<v Speaker 2>So I'm like,</v>

1729
00:48:26.470 --> 00:48:27.340
<v Speaker 2>why did he give a fuck?</v>

1730
00:48:27.370 --> 00:48:27.701
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

1731
00:48:27.701 --> 00:48:28.534
<v Speaker 2>it's a weird,</v>

1732
00:48:29.020 --> 00:48:29.853
<v Speaker 2>does it?</v>

1733
00:48:29.950 --> 00:48:32.140
<v Speaker 2>Is it more the individual though?</v>

1734
00:48:32.141 --> 00:48:36.640
<v Speaker 2>Like is it possible that somebody experienced is exactly the way they want it</v>

1735
00:48:36.641 --> 00:48:37.660
<v Speaker 2>without coming out like his kid?</v>

1736
00:48:37.750 --> 00:48:40.360
<v Speaker 2>Could it be that there's too much pressure to come out to,</v>

1737
00:48:40.690 --> 00:48:41.920
<v Speaker 2>sure they could definitely.</v>

1738
00:48:41.921 --> 00:48:42.820
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of factors.</v>

1739
00:48:43.360 --> 00:48:46.990
<v Speaker 2>I think it's all depends entirely on your environment,</v>

1740
00:48:46.991 --> 00:48:47.970
<v Speaker 2>your family,</v>

1741
00:48:48.130 --> 00:48:49.600
<v Speaker 2>religious background,</v>

1742
00:48:49.750 --> 00:48:51.070
<v Speaker 2>where you grew up.</v>

1743
00:48:51.240 --> 00:48:52.600
<v Speaker 2>If you grew up in San Francisco,</v>

1744
00:48:52.601 --> 00:48:53.950
<v Speaker 2>it's probably pretty easy to be gay.</v>

1745
00:48:54.370 --> 00:48:55.600
<v Speaker 2>If you grew up in Kentucky,</v>

1746
00:48:55.601 --> 00:48:56.950
<v Speaker 2>it's probably pretty hard to come out.</v>

1747
00:48:57.040 --> 00:48:57.311
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1748
00:48:57.311 --> 00:49:00.570
<v Speaker 2>you're in a fucking deer stand with a bunch of buddies and go,</v>

1749
00:49:00.571 --> 00:49:01.120
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>

1750
00:49:01.120 --> 00:49:01.901
<v Speaker 2>some shit.</v>

1751
00:49:01.901 --> 00:49:03.760
<v Speaker 2>I'm mean to get off my chest,</v>

1752
00:49:04.390 --> 00:49:05.223
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1753
00:49:05.290 --> 00:49:08.860
<v Speaker 2>all listening to Garth Brooks songs and shit and like one of you just happens to</v>

1754
00:49:08.861 --> 00:49:09.331
<v Speaker 2>be gay.</v>

1755
00:49:09.331 --> 00:49:10.720
<v Speaker 2>Like that guy's fucked man.</v>

1756
00:49:10.721 --> 00:49:10.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1757
00:49:10.880 --> 00:49:12.170
<v Speaker 2>He leaves the community at that point.</v>

1758
00:49:12.940 --> 00:49:13.780
<v Speaker 2>That's weird.</v>

1759
00:49:13.990 --> 00:49:14.591
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1760
00:49:14.591 --> 00:49:19.591
<v Speaker 2>if we had a situation where one of our comedian friends came out as gay out of</v>

1761
00:49:19.601 --> 00:49:20.080
<v Speaker 2>nowhere,</v>

1762
00:49:20.080 --> 00:49:21.820
<v Speaker 2>like say if already just decided to tell us,</v>

1763
00:49:21.821 --> 00:49:22.654
<v Speaker 2>you know what got</v>

1764
00:49:24.610 --> 00:49:27.090
<v Speaker 2>pretty sure I'd be like,</v>

1765
00:49:27.270 --> 00:49:28.103
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

1766
00:49:28.360 --> 00:49:29.200
<v Speaker 2>that's weird.</v>

1767
00:49:29.290 --> 00:49:30.100
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1768
00:49:30.100 --> 00:49:30.371
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

1769
00:49:30.371 --> 00:49:33.430
<v Speaker 2>you had that one guy on this guy you 10% gay.</v>

1770
00:49:33.700 --> 00:49:34.211
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1771
00:49:34.211 --> 00:49:35.080
<v Speaker 2>Brody Brody.</v>

1772
00:49:35.110 --> 00:49:35.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1773
00:49:35.770 --> 00:49:37.810
<v Speaker 2>He's 84% determined.</v>

1774
00:49:37.920 --> 00:49:39.880
<v Speaker 2>What would Ari with a lisp sound like?</v>

1775
00:49:40.150 --> 00:49:41.260
<v Speaker 2>We wouldn't have a list.</v>

1776
00:49:41.440 --> 00:49:44.230
<v Speaker 2>It sounds like I'm coming out of the closet guys.</v>

1777
00:49:44.290 --> 00:49:45.370
<v Speaker 2>Darren talking normal.</v>

1778
00:49:46.930 --> 00:49:47.651
<v Speaker 3>It happens.</v>

1779
00:49:47.651 --> 00:49:47.891
<v Speaker 3>Joe.</v>

1780
00:49:47.891 --> 00:49:48.221
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

1781
00:49:48.221 --> 00:49:48.701
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

1782
00:49:48.701 --> 00:49:51.250
<v Speaker 3>I think once you're out you can start to enhance it.</v>

1783
00:49:51.280 --> 00:49:51.731
<v Speaker 3>I think it,</v>

1784
00:49:51.731 --> 00:49:52.061
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1785
00:49:52.061 --> 00:49:52.631
<v Speaker 3>I think cause you,</v>

1786
00:49:52.631 --> 00:49:54.490
<v Speaker 3>you hide it and you breathe it in.</v>

1787
00:49:54.550 --> 00:49:54.851
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1788
00:49:54.851 --> 00:49:56.740
<v Speaker 3>you tried to hide your gayness,</v>

1789
00:49:56.890 --> 00:49:57.381
<v Speaker 3>but once it's out,</v>

1790
00:49:57.381 --> 00:49:57.641
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

1791
00:49:57.641 --> 00:49:58.001
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

1792
00:49:58.001 --> 00:49:58.720
<v Speaker 3>I'm so ready.</v>

1793
00:49:58.720 --> 00:49:58.841
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1794
00:49:58.841 --> 00:50:02.320
<v Speaker 2>some gay guys would totally disagree with that because it's gay guys that like</v>

1795
00:50:02.530 --> 00:50:03.940
<v Speaker 2>really gay men,</v>

1796
00:50:03.941 --> 00:50:08.941
<v Speaker 2>like really lispy feminine gay men and gay men that like men that are men who</v>

1797
00:50:09.461 --> 00:50:11.140
<v Speaker 2>like other men and they don't talk.</v>

1798
00:50:11.240 --> 00:50:12.000
<v Speaker 2>Gail.</v>

1799
00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:12.833
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1800
00:50:13.130 --> 00:50:13.963
<v Speaker 2>that's tough.</v>

1801
00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:15.220
<v Speaker 2>Girl was gay.</v>

1802
00:50:15.700 --> 00:50:19.330
<v Speaker 2>You know the girl was living with a guy who looked across,</v>

1803
00:50:19.410 --> 00:50:20.360
<v Speaker 2>you're like him Christ.</v>

1804
00:50:20.361 --> 00:50:20.550
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

1805
00:50:20.550 --> 00:50:21.290
<v Speaker 2>Him and Christ.</v>

1806
00:50:21.290 --> 00:50:21.471
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1807
00:50:21.471 --> 00:50:23.110
<v Speaker 2>I have those bears.</v>

1808
00:50:23.350 --> 00:50:24.340
<v Speaker 2>They wouldn't be,</v>

1809
00:50:24.360 --> 00:50:25.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1810
00:50:25.060 --> 00:50:26.470
<v Speaker 2>it wouldn't be obvious.</v>

1811
00:50:26.680 --> 00:50:26.960
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1812
00:50:26.960 --> 00:50:27.410
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1813
00:50:27.410 --> 00:50:28.160
<v Speaker 2>That's a delicious</v>

1814
00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:28.993
<v Speaker 1>couple.</v>

1815
00:50:29.020 --> 00:50:30.620
<v Speaker 1>Imagine they're great with another,</v>

1816
00:50:30.650 --> 00:50:32.540
<v Speaker 1>they have sex or not to just so awesome.</v>

1817
00:50:32.630 --> 00:50:37.630
<v Speaker 5>So what percentage do you think then are complete like flaming the whole way</v>

1818
00:50:38.511 --> 00:50:39.170
<v Speaker 5>versus,</v>

1819
00:50:39.170 --> 00:50:40.030
<v Speaker 5>I think that's never,</v>

1820
00:50:40.040 --> 00:50:40.873
<v Speaker 5>you'd never know.</v>

1821
00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:41.870
<v Speaker 1>That's PR.</v>

1822
00:50:41.870 --> 00:50:42.280
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno.</v>

1823
00:50:42.280 --> 00:50:45.700
<v Speaker 1>1.7% if it's 1.7 so let's round it off.</v>

1824
00:50:45.701 --> 00:50:48.130
<v Speaker 1>Let's say it's 2% that are in the closet,</v>

1825
00:50:48.430 --> 00:50:49.570
<v Speaker 1>2% out of the closet.</v>

1826
00:50:49.571 --> 00:50:50.980
<v Speaker 1>4% of all Americans gay.</v>

1827
00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:51.940
<v Speaker 1>We willing to say that.</v>

1828
00:50:52.120 --> 00:50:52.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm willing to say that.</v>

1829
00:50:52.840 --> 00:50:53.673
<v Speaker 1>I want to say that.</v>

1830
00:50:54.090 --> 00:50:54.371
<v Speaker 1>I'll go.</v>

1831
00:50:54.371 --> 00:50:54.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1832
00:50:54.570 --> 00:50:55.450
<v Speaker 1>that's probably about right.</v>

1833
00:50:55.780 --> 00:50:57.670
<v Speaker 1>So 4% of all Americans being gay.</v>

1834
00:50:59.470 --> 00:51:01.090
<v Speaker 1>I'd say Super Gay dudes.</v>

1835
00:51:01.180 --> 00:51:02.230
<v Speaker 1>It's like 1%</v>

1836
00:51:03.600 --> 00:51:05.170
<v Speaker 5>and that's mostly drug pointed.</v>

1837
00:51:05.180 --> 00:51:07.110
<v Speaker 5>The drug probably like just raging,</v>

1838
00:51:07.111 --> 00:51:08.340
<v Speaker 5>like I wanna fuck you in the ass.</v>

1839
00:51:09.280 --> 00:51:10.020
<v Speaker 1>No Man.</v>

1840
00:51:10.020 --> 00:51:11.810
<v Speaker 1>I have some friends that are a,</v>

1841
00:51:11.811 --> 00:51:16.150
<v Speaker 1>a gay couple that live in my neighborhood and they're pretty obviously gay,</v>

1842
00:51:16.180 --> 00:51:20.940
<v Speaker 1>but they're not like partiers or animals or anything wacky then.</v>

1843
00:51:20.941 --> 00:51:21.400
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1844
00:51:21.400 --> 00:51:22.233
<v Speaker 1>not doing,</v>

1845
00:51:22.520 --> 00:51:23.540
<v Speaker 5>I don't think they're doing drugs.</v>

1846
00:51:23.570 --> 00:51:25.130
<v Speaker 5>You know what's weird about it to me is like,</v>

1847
00:51:25.430 --> 00:51:26.480
<v Speaker 5>I know for myself,</v>

1848
00:51:26.510 --> 00:51:29.270
<v Speaker 5>I don't really want to be defined by anything.</v>

1849
00:51:29.480 --> 00:51:32.490
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to be defined by one thing about mice and you're queer.</v>

1850
00:51:32.950 --> 00:51:34.210
<v Speaker 5>Queer is perfect.</v>

1851
00:51:34.730 --> 00:51:35.240
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to fit.</v>

1852
00:51:35.240 --> 00:51:38.540
<v Speaker 5>So I'm going to fit right in the LBG and somebody can,</v>

1853
00:51:38.550 --> 00:51:41.540
<v Speaker 5>like the last thing I want is some kind of label,</v>

1854
00:51:41.600 --> 00:51:44.360
<v Speaker 5>but in that world it seems like that's exactly what,</v>

1855
00:51:44.480 --> 00:51:45.051
<v Speaker 5>you know what I mean?</v>

1856
00:51:45.051 --> 00:51:45.884
<v Speaker 5>You want to be labeled.</v>

1857
00:51:45.890 --> 00:51:46.281
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1858
00:51:46.281 --> 00:51:46.821
<v Speaker 5>It's so,</v>

1859
00:51:46.821 --> 00:51:47.511
<v Speaker 5>it's so weird.</v>

1860
00:51:47.511 --> 00:51:48.344
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

1861
00:51:48.540 --> 00:51:49.250
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

1862
00:51:49.250 --> 00:51:50.950
<v Speaker 5>I think because there's a lot,</v>

1863
00:51:50.950 --> 00:51:51.030
<v Speaker 5>a lot</v>

1864
00:51:51.030 --> 00:51:51.571
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

1865
00:51:51.571 --> 00:51:52.404
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1866
00:51:52.830 --> 00:51:55.290
<v Speaker 1>they want to be identified,</v>

1867
00:51:55.291 --> 00:51:56.010
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

1868
00:51:56.010 --> 00:51:57.360
<v Speaker 1>they're proud to be out,</v>

1869
00:51:57.390 --> 00:52:01.440
<v Speaker 1>like to be out is probably like a huge relief off of your back.</v>

1870
00:52:01.470 --> 00:52:02.100
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1871
00:52:02.100 --> 00:52:02.700
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

1872
00:52:02.700 --> 00:52:03.061
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1873
00:52:03.061 --> 00:52:06.030
<v Speaker 1>just to be out and accept and not have to hide that shit anymore.</v>

1874
00:52:06.210 --> 00:52:08.010
<v Speaker 1>None of to have that hovering over your head.</v>

1875
00:52:08.040 --> 00:52:10.410
<v Speaker 1>I'd probably probably really fucks with people.</v>

1876
00:52:10.950 --> 00:52:11.783
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1877
00:52:11.970 --> 00:52:16.350
<v Speaker 1>so it's probably like an affirmation and a lot of ways to just to say you're</v>

1878
00:52:16.351 --> 00:52:17.130
<v Speaker 1>gay,</v>

1879
00:52:17.130 --> 00:52:18.390
<v Speaker 1>but the queer thing is,</v>

1880
00:52:18.540 --> 00:52:20.100
<v Speaker 1>I think they don't want to be,</v>

1881
00:52:20.880 --> 00:52:21.780
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to butcher this.</v>

1882
00:52:22.420 --> 00:52:23.253
<v Speaker 1>My Queer friends,</v>

1883
00:52:23.670 --> 00:52:28.290
<v Speaker 1>they don't want to be described as a he or a she or a gay or a straight,</v>

1884
00:52:28.650 --> 00:52:29.820
<v Speaker 1>they want to be that.</v>

1885
00:52:30.120 --> 00:52:31.290
<v Speaker 1>There's those folks too.</v>

1886
00:52:31.950 --> 00:52:32.131
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1887
00:52:32.131 --> 00:52:32.521
<v Speaker 1>otherwise,</v>

1888
00:52:32.521 --> 00:52:33.360
<v Speaker 1>why would it be queer?</v>

1889
00:52:33.361 --> 00:52:34.470
<v Speaker 1>Why wouldn't it be bisexual?</v>

1890
00:52:34.471 --> 00:52:35.220
<v Speaker 1>Like what are you,</v>

1891
00:52:35.220 --> 00:52:36.240
<v Speaker 1>are you I'm queer.</v>

1892
00:52:36.360 --> 00:52:36.571
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1893
00:52:36.571 --> 00:52:37.141
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>

1894
00:52:37.141 --> 00:52:37.771
<v Speaker 1>Are you gay,</v>

1895
00:52:37.771 --> 00:52:39.240
<v Speaker 1>straight or bisexual?</v>

1896
00:52:39.280 --> 00:52:39.780
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

1897
00:52:39.780 --> 00:52:40.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm queer.</v>

1898
00:52:40.190 --> 00:52:41.023
<v Speaker 1>Just queer.</v>

1899
00:52:41.070 --> 00:52:42.420
<v Speaker 1>So you're just all right.</v>

1900
00:52:42.900 --> 00:52:43.650
<v Speaker 1>I got it.</v>

1901
00:52:43.650 --> 00:52:44.490
<v Speaker 1>I think I got it.</v>

1902
00:52:44.790 --> 00:52:45.660
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I have it.</v>

1903
00:52:45.960 --> 00:52:46.470
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1904
00:52:46.470 --> 00:52:47.580
<v Speaker 1>it's so that's a real,</v>

1905
00:52:47.640 --> 00:52:48.630
<v Speaker 1>that's a thing that's queer,</v>

1906
00:52:48.631 --> 00:52:49.530
<v Speaker 1>that's queer is,</v>

1907
00:52:49.590 --> 00:52:50.760
<v Speaker 1>no one's ever told me that before.</v>

1908
00:52:50.761 --> 00:52:51.110
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1909
00:52:51.110 --> 00:52:51.841
<v Speaker 1>just fucking Canadians.</v>

1910
00:52:51.841 --> 00:52:52.651
<v Speaker 1>We keep shit from you.</v>

1911
00:52:52.651 --> 00:52:52.861
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1912
00:52:52.861 --> 00:52:53.410
<v Speaker 1>I guess so.</v>

1913
00:52:53.410 --> 00:52:54.243
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of things we can,</v>

1914
00:52:54.480 --> 00:52:57.120
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure if I investigated I could figure it out.</v>

1915
00:52:57.140 --> 00:52:58.610
<v Speaker 1>But baby we had,</v>

1916
00:52:58.980 --> 00:53:00.930
<v Speaker 1>there's one hell of a pride parade in Toronto.</v>

1917
00:53:00.960 --> 00:53:03.180
<v Speaker 1>One hell of a pride because it queer pride though.</v>

1918
00:53:03.181 --> 00:53:06.030
<v Speaker 1>That's a fucking confusing parade because if you're truly queer he wouldn't even</v>

1919
00:53:06.031 --> 00:53:07.890
<v Speaker 1>show up for it cause you don't even identify with it,</v>

1920
00:53:08.450 --> 00:53:08.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1921
00:53:08.700 --> 00:53:10.830
<v Speaker 1>identify with that group that's running that parade.</v>

1922
00:53:11.160 --> 00:53:11.800
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1923
00:53:11.800 --> 00:53:11.961
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1924
00:53:11.961 --> 00:53:16.200
<v Speaker 1>I think people for the longest time have been suppressed and still are.</v>

1925
00:53:16.320 --> 00:53:20.190
<v Speaker 1>But I think for the longest time they didn't have an outlet where they can</v>

1926
00:53:20.191 --> 00:53:24.870
<v Speaker 1>identify with other people that have also been suppressed in very similar ways.</v>

1927
00:53:25.080 --> 00:53:26.160
<v Speaker 1>So whether it's being</v>

1928
00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:29.130
<v Speaker 2>gay or whether it's being transgender or whether it's being,</v>

1929
00:53:29.250 --> 00:53:32.070
<v Speaker 2>they didn't have a community before to support them.</v>

1930
00:53:32.280 --> 00:53:35.580
<v Speaker 2>They just had scattered groups of people all across the country with no way to</v>

1931
00:53:35.581 --> 00:53:36.510
<v Speaker 2>communicate with each other.</v>

1932
00:53:36.590 --> 00:53:36.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1933
00:53:36.930 --> 00:53:37.763
<v Speaker 2>Now that you can,</v>

1934
00:53:39.020 --> 00:53:40.800
<v Speaker 2>it's probably the time that we're in it.</v>

1935
00:53:40.801 --> 00:53:42.240
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it will be like that forever.</v>

1936
00:53:42.630 --> 00:53:43.590
<v Speaker 2>At some point you mean?</v>

1937
00:53:43.710 --> 00:53:43.980
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1938
00:53:43.980 --> 00:53:46.200
<v Speaker 2>at some point I feel like the,</v>

1939
00:53:46.530 --> 00:53:49.380
<v Speaker 2>it won't be as exciting as it is now to be a queer.</v>

1940
00:53:50.740 --> 00:53:55.560
<v Speaker 2>Here's what I mean by that is since it's only recently become as accepted as it</v>

1941
00:53:55.561 --> 00:53:56.150
<v Speaker 2>is now,</v>

1942
00:53:56.150 --> 00:53:56.301
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1943
00:53:56.301 --> 00:53:56.600
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1944
00:53:56.600 --> 00:53:57.510
<v Speaker 2>50 years ago,</v>

1945
00:53:57.570 --> 00:54:01.410
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what they were going to do to somebody who came out or a hundred</v>

1946
00:54:01.410 --> 00:54:02.243
<v Speaker 2>years ago or whatever.</v>

1947
00:54:02.430 --> 00:54:03.930
<v Speaker 2>It was obviously a tougher time,</v>

1948
00:54:04.110 --> 00:54:08.700
<v Speaker 2>so eventually it will be so commonplace that it won't even drum up nearly the</v>

1949
00:54:08.701 --> 00:54:09.930
<v Speaker 2>discussion than it does now.</v>

1950
00:54:09.990 --> 00:54:10.291
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1951
00:54:10.291 --> 00:54:12.980
<v Speaker 2>but as long as it's only 4% of the population,</v>

1952
00:54:12.981 --> 00:54:15.270
<v Speaker 2>that's always going to be a marginalized group.</v>

1953
00:54:15.360 --> 00:54:15.780
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1954
00:54:15.780 --> 00:54:18.180
<v Speaker 2>I guess so I can't go with you on that,</v>

1955
00:54:18.210 --> 00:54:21.090
<v Speaker 2>but do you think it's always going to be 4% is that something that's,</v>

1956
00:54:21.390 --> 00:54:23.910
<v Speaker 2>is it something that is a growing figure shrinking figure?</v>

1957
00:54:23.970 --> 00:54:25.140
<v Speaker 2>That's where it becomes a real problem.</v>

1958
00:54:25.141 --> 00:54:26.100
<v Speaker 2>And the Christian community,</v>

1959
00:54:26.101 --> 00:54:28.740
<v Speaker 2>because that means a bunch of queers or indoctrinate and all the young,</v>

1960
00:54:29.340 --> 00:54:30.173
<v Speaker 2>that's what's going on.</v>

1961
00:54:30.180 --> 00:54:31.200
<v Speaker 2>They're spreading their queer.</v>

1962
00:54:31.410 --> 00:54:31.860
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1963
00:54:31.860 --> 00:54:35.160
<v Speaker 2>while there's a lot of people that believe that if you sexually indoctrinate</v>

1964
00:54:35.161 --> 00:54:36.780
<v Speaker 2>someone to world of homosexuality,</v>

1965
00:54:36.781 --> 00:54:37.710
<v Speaker 2>very young in life,</v>

1966
00:54:37.711 --> 00:54:40.240
<v Speaker 2>that they'll identify with that impresses.</v>

1967
00:54:40.290 --> 00:54:41.820
<v Speaker 2>It does a deep conversation,</v>

1968
00:54:41.821 --> 00:54:43.320
<v Speaker 2>dude to deep conversation,</v>

1969
00:54:43.321 --> 00:54:45.300
<v Speaker 2>but it has more to do.</v>

1970
00:54:45.301 --> 00:54:46.410
<v Speaker 2>What is it with the pedophile,</v>

1971
00:54:46.830 --> 00:54:47.620
<v Speaker 2>pedophile stuff?</v>

1972
00:54:47.620 --> 00:54:49.110
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying pedophilia.</v>

1973
00:54:49.111 --> 00:54:49.230
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1974
00:54:49.230 --> 00:54:49.500
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1975
00:54:49.500 --> 00:54:49.711
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1976
00:54:49.711 --> 00:54:50.010
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1977
00:54:50.010 --> 00:54:55.010
<v Speaker 2>But the likelihood of a person who was molested by a pedophile turning into a</v>

1978
00:54:55.321 --> 00:54:56.520
<v Speaker 2>pedophile themselves.</v>

1979
00:54:56.610 --> 00:54:57.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1980
00:54:57.150 --> 00:54:58.440
<v Speaker 2>I think that's documented.</v>

1981
00:54:58.470 --> 00:54:59.490
<v Speaker 2>That is documented.</v>

1982
00:54:59.520 --> 00:55:00.140
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

1983
00:55:00.140 --> 00:55:02.460
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if those are totally related,</v>

1984
00:55:02.730 --> 00:55:03.420
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1985
00:55:03.420 --> 00:55:03.631
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1986
00:55:03.631 --> 00:55:07.590
<v Speaker 2>just how young being young exp experiences you have when you're young helped</v>

1987
00:55:07.600 --> 00:55:09.480
<v Speaker 2>shape your perception of so many things.</v>

1988
00:55:09.540 --> 00:55:09.991
<v Speaker 2>It does.</v>

1989
00:55:09.991 --> 00:55:10.681
<v Speaker 2>And also,</v>

1990
00:55:10.681 --> 00:55:11.100
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1991
00:55:11.100 --> 00:55:16.100
<v Speaker 2>women who have been molested a young age tend to lean more towards prostitution</v>

1992
00:55:17.011 --> 00:55:21.420
<v Speaker 2>and towards a pornography and towards a lot of things along those lines that</v>

1993
00:55:21.421 --> 00:55:23.910
<v Speaker 2>their ideas about sexuality get morphed.</v>

1994
00:55:24.420 --> 00:55:25.410
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

1995
00:55:25.411 --> 00:55:25.731
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1996
00:55:25.731 --> 00:55:26.491
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting,</v>

1997
00:55:26.491 --> 00:55:27.090
<v Speaker 2>Matt.</v>

1998
00:55:27.090 --> 00:55:27.810
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1999
00:55:27.810 --> 00:55:28.201
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2000
00:55:28.201 --> 00:55:29.640
<v Speaker 2>the 4% thing,</v>

2001
00:55:29.641 --> 00:55:30.474
<v Speaker 2>like you know what,</v>

2002
00:55:30.510 --> 00:55:31.090
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

2003
00:55:31.090 --> 00:55:33.440
<v Speaker 2>there's another question like what makes someone gay?</v>

2004
00:55:33.780 --> 00:55:36.000
<v Speaker 2>I mean how many people are gay because of a choice.</v>

2005
00:55:36.420 --> 00:55:39.240
<v Speaker 2>How many people would be like fucking dealing with chicks?</v>

2006
00:55:39.241 --> 00:55:39.841
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to learn,</v>

2007
00:55:39.841 --> 00:55:40.950
<v Speaker 2>start liking dude.</v>

2008
00:55:41.340 --> 00:55:42.110
<v Speaker 2>How many of them,</v>

2009
00:55:42.110 --> 00:55:44.760
<v Speaker 2>and I feel like the company line is that people are born gay.</v>

2010
00:55:44.760 --> 00:55:47.520
<v Speaker 2>But I always had difficulty with that.</v>

2011
00:55:47.610 --> 00:55:48.770
<v Speaker 2>I mean I have,</v>

2012
00:55:48.780 --> 00:55:50.910
<v Speaker 2>I have difficulty believing people are born anything.</v>

2013
00:55:51.060 --> 00:55:53.070
<v Speaker 2>Oh you need to meet this kid that lives on my street.</v>

2014
00:55:53.090 --> 00:55:53.341
<v Speaker 2>Like no,</v>

2015
00:55:53.341 --> 00:55:53.580
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

2016
00:55:53.580 --> 00:55:56.010
<v Speaker 2>but by this I mean by this I mean that's some percentage,</v>

2017
00:55:56.130 --> 00:55:59.820
<v Speaker 2>some percentage of our existences nature in some percentage of our existence is</v>

2018
00:55:59.821 --> 00:56:00.654
<v Speaker 2>nurture.</v>

2019
00:56:00.750 --> 00:56:00.931
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2020
00:56:00.931 --> 00:56:01.561
<v Speaker 2>It's a mixture.</v>

2021
00:56:01.561 --> 00:56:02.520
<v Speaker 2>It's not any one,</v>

2022
00:56:02.670 --> 00:56:03.600
<v Speaker 2>it's not concrete.</v>

2023
00:56:03.601 --> 00:56:07.410
<v Speaker 2>You don't come out with a concrete perspective on anything except this kid on my</v>

2024
00:56:07.411 --> 00:56:07.920
<v Speaker 2>street,</v>

2025
00:56:07.920 --> 00:56:09.900
<v Speaker 2>he's five and he's gay as fuck,</v>

2026
00:56:10.900 --> 00:56:12.870
<v Speaker 2>but five by five.</v>

2027
00:56:13.110 --> 00:56:17.940
<v Speaker 2>I think we underestimate how quickly characters built on an individual between</v>

2028
00:56:17.941 --> 00:56:20.640
<v Speaker 2>the ages of one to two or two to three.</v>

2029
00:56:20.850 --> 00:56:23.130
<v Speaker 2>We look at a five year old and for us as adults,</v>

2030
00:56:23.470 --> 00:56:24.370
<v Speaker 2>years is nothing.</v>

2031
00:56:24.370 --> 00:56:25.203
<v Speaker 5>It's a blank,</v>

2032
00:56:25.510 --> 00:56:27.040
<v Speaker 5>but for them it's so,</v>

2033
00:56:27.400 --> 00:56:27.820
<v Speaker 5>yes.</v>

2034
00:56:27.820 --> 00:56:31.390
<v Speaker 5>It's such a huge span in so much is happening in that period of time.</v>

2035
00:56:31.470 --> 00:56:31.921
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

2036
00:56:31.921 --> 00:56:36.000
<v Speaker 1>and your childhood being traumatic is incredibly hard to get over.</v>

2037
00:56:36.040 --> 00:56:38.190
<v Speaker 1>It's just the fact that it happened 15 years ago.</v>

2038
00:56:38.191 --> 00:56:40.720
<v Speaker 1>It's set the boundaries and the framework,</v>

2039
00:56:40.740 --> 00:56:44.670
<v Speaker 1>sort of the building blocks of your personality and to kind of go back and</v>

2040
00:56:44.671 --> 00:56:45.690
<v Speaker 1>repair that shit.</v>

2041
00:56:45.930 --> 00:56:48.750
<v Speaker 1>Very difficult to do two people know or do some people,</v>

2042
00:56:48.751 --> 00:56:50.450
<v Speaker 1>most people I think never do,</v>

2043
00:56:50.980 --> 00:56:54.420
<v Speaker 1>but as opposed to someone who's born and raised in a really,</v>

2044
00:56:54.421 --> 00:56:57.510
<v Speaker 1>like I have friends that grew up fucked up and they're just,</v>

2045
00:56:57.660 --> 00:57:02.660
<v Speaker 1>there's something about the fucked up at that they encountered that just they're</v>

2046
00:57:02.671 --> 00:57:03.061
<v Speaker 1>gone.</v>

2047
00:57:03.061 --> 00:57:04.770
<v Speaker 1>They're never going to come all the way back.</v>

2048
00:57:04.800 --> 00:57:07.620
<v Speaker 1>They never got to look at themselves objectively than ever going to step back</v>

2049
00:57:07.621 --> 00:57:12.621
<v Speaker 1>and try to fix many or any of the personality issues they might have developed</v>

2050
00:57:12.930 --> 00:57:15.060
<v Speaker 1>because of like a protective mechanism.</v>

2051
00:57:15.061 --> 00:57:16.530
<v Speaker 1>They sort of developed as a young person.</v>

2052
00:57:16.560 --> 00:57:17.490
<v Speaker 1>There's not going to do it.</v>

2053
00:57:17.550 --> 00:57:18.301
<v Speaker 1>I shut off button.</v>

2054
00:57:18.301 --> 00:57:18.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2055
00:57:18.480 --> 00:57:19.150
<v Speaker 1>there's just a,</v>

2056
00:57:19.150 --> 00:57:20.130
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is,</v>

2057
00:57:20.190 --> 00:57:20.370
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

2058
00:57:20.370 --> 00:57:20.730
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

2059
00:57:20.730 --> 00:57:21.480
<v Speaker 1>they're done,</v>

2060
00:57:21.480 --> 00:57:22.313
<v Speaker 1>they're done growing,</v>

2061
00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:26.190
<v Speaker 1>changing and then other people like you meet them in their consistently</v>

2062
00:57:26.191 --> 00:57:30.610
<v Speaker 1>exploring their personality and their life and improving upon themselves and</v>

2063
00:57:30.750 --> 00:57:32.190
<v Speaker 1>doing new things.</v>

2064
00:57:32.460 --> 00:57:32.641
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2065
00:57:32.641 --> 00:57:33.960
<v Speaker 1>I love when I talked to someone like,</v>

2066
00:57:33.961 --> 00:57:34.231
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

2067
00:57:34.231 --> 00:57:36.060
<v Speaker 1>I took up scuba dive in like bots.</v>

2068
00:57:36.510 --> 00:57:37.320
<v Speaker 1>That's awesome.</v>

2069
00:57:37.320 --> 00:57:38.400
<v Speaker 1>Tell me about scuba diving.</v>

2070
00:57:38.401 --> 00:57:39.540
<v Speaker 1>You know like people,</v>

2071
00:57:39.541 --> 00:57:43.800
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's not the best example but about someone who's like consistently and</v>

2072
00:57:43.801 --> 00:57:45.570
<v Speaker 1>constantly trying to expand,</v>

2073
00:57:45.730 --> 00:57:45.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2074
00:57:45.940 --> 00:57:46.171
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>

2075
00:57:46.171 --> 00:57:49.650
<v Speaker 1>their experiences and try to and analyzing their life.</v>

2076
00:57:49.860 --> 00:57:54.300
<v Speaker 1>Then there's other people that are just in a sea of bad decision making and</v>

2077
00:57:54.330 --> 00:57:58.290
<v Speaker 1>alcoholism and drug abuse and gambling and this and that.</v>

2078
00:57:58.520 --> 00:57:59.121
<v Speaker 5>It seems like,</v>

2079
00:57:59.121 --> 00:57:59.990
<v Speaker 5>it seems like it,</v>

2080
00:58:00.050 --> 00:58:00.680
<v Speaker 5>it can,</v>

2081
00:58:00.680 --> 00:58:02.630
<v Speaker 5>he can come out in so many different ways,</v>

2082
00:58:02.631 --> 00:58:05.840
<v Speaker 5>but it ultimately stems from being happy or not being happy,</v>

2083
00:58:05.841 --> 00:58:06.051
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2084
00:58:06.051 --> 00:58:07.370
<v Speaker 5>finding a way to get there.</v>

2085
00:58:07.560 --> 00:58:07.820
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

2086
00:58:07.820 --> 00:58:09.260
<v Speaker 5>It can mean shit can happen to you,</v>

2087
00:58:09.320 --> 00:58:13.370
<v Speaker 5>and you have that moment of interpretation where you can take it one way or take</v>

2088
00:58:13.371 --> 00:58:14.930
<v Speaker 5>it down down a different path,</v>

2089
00:58:15.230 --> 00:58:17.570
<v Speaker 5>and the more severe the experience,</v>

2090
00:58:17.660 --> 00:58:21.380
<v Speaker 5>the harder it is to take it in a positive way as we were.</v>

2091
00:58:21.530 --> 00:58:21.951
<v Speaker 5>That is,</v>

2092
00:58:21.951 --> 00:58:22.784
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

2093
00:58:22.820 --> 00:58:23.653
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>

2094
00:58:23.670 --> 00:58:25.370
<v Speaker 5>Like for example,</v>

2095
00:58:25.371 --> 00:58:26.030
<v Speaker 5>failure,</v>

2096
00:58:26.030 --> 00:58:28.550
<v Speaker 5>like that's the main way you learn how to do something.</v>

2097
00:58:29.450 --> 00:58:31.580
<v Speaker 5>So I'm going to learn how to ride a bike.</v>

2098
00:58:31.910 --> 00:58:32.420
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2099
00:58:32.420 --> 00:58:34.160
<v Speaker 5>if I fall off that bike,</v>

2100
00:58:34.161 --> 00:58:37.970
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to learn really quickly to stay focused so that that doesn't happen</v>

2101
00:58:37.971 --> 00:58:39.470
<v Speaker 5>because there's pain on the other end of it.</v>

2102
00:58:39.860 --> 00:58:44.860
<v Speaker 5>So here's this really negative thing that actually acts as the mechanism for</v>

2103
00:58:45.321 --> 00:58:47.900
<v Speaker 5>getting me from a to B and getting better at something.</v>

2104
00:58:48.290 --> 00:58:52.400
<v Speaker 5>But the pain portion on its own when you can't justify it,</v>

2105
00:58:52.401 --> 00:58:54.350
<v Speaker 5>when you can't figure out the end message,</v>

2106
00:58:54.351 --> 00:58:57.800
<v Speaker 5>when you can't figure out what I've learned because of this,</v>

2107
00:58:57.801 --> 00:58:59.630
<v Speaker 5>that's when it's the toughest to digest.</v>

2108
00:59:00.530 --> 00:59:00.921
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2109
00:59:00.921 --> 00:59:04.520
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a lot of folks that tried to stay as comfortable as possible,</v>

2110
00:59:04.970 --> 00:59:05.960
<v Speaker 1>as much as possible,</v>

2111
00:59:05.961 --> 00:59:06.231
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

2112
00:59:06.231 --> 00:59:07.730
<v Speaker 1>So terrified of that pain,</v>

2113
00:59:07.870 --> 00:59:08.110
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2114
00:59:08.110 --> 00:59:13.110
<v Speaker 1>So instead they just don't experience much like a very narrow world of,</v>

2115
00:59:13.850 --> 00:59:14.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2116
00:59:14.360 --> 00:59:17.570
<v Speaker 1>and then maybe they'll experience like a little bit of emotional pain online</v>

2117
00:59:17.690 --> 00:59:18.523
<v Speaker 1>every now and again.</v>

2118
00:59:18.770 --> 00:59:19.603
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

2119
00:59:19.670 --> 00:59:22.010
<v Speaker 1>Like they'll put up a youtube video then read the comments</v>

2120
00:59:22.990 --> 00:59:23.590
<v Speaker 5>and that's,</v>

2121
00:59:23.590 --> 00:59:24.560
<v Speaker 5>that's the enough,</v>

2122
00:59:24.600 --> 00:59:24.870
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2123
00:59:24.870 --> 00:59:28.100
<v Speaker 5>no bike riding for them because that would be some real life pain.</v>

2124
00:59:28.130 --> 00:59:28.281
<v Speaker 5>See,</v>

2125
00:59:28.281 --> 00:59:28.671
<v Speaker 5>I have,</v>

2126
00:59:28.671 --> 00:59:29.780
<v Speaker 5>I have two little kids.</v>

2127
00:59:29.781 --> 00:59:31.460
<v Speaker 5>I have a four year old and a two year old.</v>

2128
00:59:31.940 --> 00:59:36.350
<v Speaker 5>And just like my life has changed a lot since having them just didn't analyzing</v>

2129
00:59:36.351 --> 00:59:37.410
<v Speaker 5>their behavior and,</v>

2130
00:59:37.450 --> 00:59:40.250
<v Speaker 5>and then analyzing my own in contrast to,</v>

2131
00:59:40.251 --> 00:59:42.410
<v Speaker 5>there's like again,</v>

2132
00:59:42.411 --> 00:59:42.670
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

2133
00:59:42.670 --> 00:59:42.870
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

2134
00:59:42.870 --> 00:59:47.540
<v Speaker 5>adults are constantly trying to find ways to avoid pain,</v>

2135
00:59:47.600 --> 00:59:49.350
<v Speaker 5>to avoid off,</v>

2136
00:59:49.490 --> 00:59:51.200
<v Speaker 5>not feeling great all the time.</v>

2137
00:59:51.700 --> 00:59:53.150
<v Speaker 5>Like we're complete,</v>

2138
00:59:53.300 --> 00:59:53.721
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2139
00:59:53.721 --> 00:59:54.471
<v Speaker 5>risk avoidance.</v>

2140
00:59:54.471 --> 00:59:54.651
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2141
00:59:54.651 --> 00:59:55.550
<v Speaker 5>the average person,</v>

2142
00:59:55.551 --> 00:59:55.851
<v Speaker 5>whatever,</v>

2143
00:59:55.851 --> 00:59:58.190
<v Speaker 5>nine to five type individual them,</v>

2144
00:59:58.310 --> 01:00:00.260
<v Speaker 5>they put themselves out there for no reason.</v>

2145
01:00:00.350 --> 01:00:01.220
<v Speaker 5>My four year old,</v>

2146
01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:02.181
<v Speaker 5>there's a swing set.</v>

2147
01:00:02.181 --> 01:00:05.900
<v Speaker 5>He could go on the swing or he could pick one of the posts going to to the top</v>

2148
01:00:05.901 --> 01:00:07.520
<v Speaker 5>and climb all the way to the top and sit.</v>

2149
01:00:07.640 --> 01:00:08.473
<v Speaker 5>He's four.</v>

2150
01:00:08.840 --> 01:00:09.280
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2151
01:00:09.280 --> 01:00:11.240
<v Speaker 5>like what is driving him to do that?</v>

2152
01:00:11.420 --> 01:00:13.250
<v Speaker 5>Because the adult mind would say,</v>

2153
01:00:13.251 --> 01:00:13.401
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

2154
01:00:13.401 --> 01:00:16.130
<v Speaker 5>you're going to break your wrist or leg or whatever,</v>

2155
01:00:16.131 --> 01:00:16.910
<v Speaker 5>and he might,</v>

2156
01:00:16.910 --> 01:00:18.410
<v Speaker 5>and someone's going to blame me for it.</v>

2157
01:00:18.411 --> 01:00:19.244
<v Speaker 5>Fine.</v>

2158
01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:22.400
<v Speaker 5>But that it's the drive portion in and of itself.</v>

2159
01:00:22.401 --> 01:00:25.190
<v Speaker 5>This just wanting to experiment,</v>

2160
01:00:25.460 --> 01:00:26.540
<v Speaker 5>that's the most exciting.</v>

2161
01:00:26.541 --> 01:00:28.760
<v Speaker 5>That's the part that I want to tap into.</v>

2162
01:00:28.761 --> 01:00:29.990
<v Speaker 5>That's the part that's contagious.</v>

2163
01:00:29.991 --> 01:00:31.190
<v Speaker 5>You see him do that and it's like,</v>

2164
01:00:31.191 --> 01:00:31.970
<v Speaker 5>shit,</v>

2165
01:00:31.970 --> 01:00:32.480
<v Speaker 5>why do I,</v>

2166
01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:33.620
<v Speaker 5>why should I fall in line?</v>

2167
01:00:33.650 --> 01:00:35.300
<v Speaker 5>Even if it's not directly related?</v>

2168
01:00:35.510 --> 01:00:38.420
<v Speaker 5>Why does the next thing I do need to be the status quo?</v>

2169
01:00:39.010 --> 01:00:39.980
<v Speaker 5>Like what we did today,</v>

2170
01:00:40.460 --> 01:00:42.860
<v Speaker 5>what we did today is not your average tech video,</v>

2171
01:00:42.980 --> 01:00:43.780
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2172
01:00:43.780 --> 01:00:44.030
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2173
01:00:44.030 --> 01:00:44.820
<v Speaker 5>to tell people.</v>

2174
01:00:44.820 --> 01:00:45.653
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2175
01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:48.380
<v Speaker 5>I was wondering if you were going to talk about it for sure.</v>

2176
01:00:48.381 --> 01:00:49.520
<v Speaker 5>We've talked about anything and everything.</v>

2177
01:00:49.580 --> 01:00:50.510
<v Speaker 5>What we did today,</v>

2178
01:00:51.380 --> 01:00:52.250
<v Speaker 5>we ran a little test.</v>

2179
01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:53.113
<v Speaker 5>I'll experiment.</v>

2180
01:00:53.770 --> 01:00:54.380
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

2181
01:00:54.380 --> 01:00:55.220
<v Speaker 5>do people know?</v>

2182
01:00:55.370 --> 01:01:00.110
<v Speaker 5>Most people know behind this studio is an a little mini archery range.</v>

2183
01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:01.581
<v Speaker 5>If you don't know that,</v>

2184
01:01:01.581 --> 01:01:02.390
<v Speaker 5>you shouldn't know that.</v>

2185
01:01:02.390 --> 01:01:04.790
<v Speaker 5>There's a couple of pictures on Joe's Instagram feed.</v>

2186
01:01:04.850 --> 01:01:05.900
<v Speaker 5>That's how I knew about it.</v>

2187
01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:06.850
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

2188
01:01:06.850 --> 01:01:11.850
<v Speaker 5>a little mini archery range and the experiment involved bringing some technology</v>

2189
01:01:12.081 --> 01:01:17.081
<v Speaker 5>components out here to figure out how they would resist the impact of an Arrow,</v>

2190
01:01:18.890 --> 01:01:19.310
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2191
01:01:19.310 --> 01:01:19.610
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

2192
01:01:19.610 --> 01:01:20.420
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>

2193
01:01:20.420 --> 01:01:20.980
<v Speaker 5>yes.</v>

2194
01:01:20.980 --> 01:01:22.610
<v Speaker 5>Have I done a good job so far?</v>

2195
01:01:22.620 --> 01:01:24.830
<v Speaker 5>I feel like I'm dancing around the subject.</v>

2196
01:01:25.070 --> 01:01:25.850
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

2197
01:01:25.850 --> 01:01:26.840
<v Speaker 5>The upcoming iPhone,</v>

2198
01:01:26.841 --> 01:01:31.841
<v Speaker 5>the iPhone six supposedly has a sapphire display or a display that's partially</v>

2199
01:01:32.571 --> 01:01:33.291
<v Speaker 5>made of Sapphire.</v>

2200
01:01:33.291 --> 01:01:34.340
<v Speaker 5>Here's a problem with Sapphire.</v>

2201
01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:35.030
<v Speaker 5>How Tech,</v>

2202
01:01:35.030 --> 01:01:36.070
<v Speaker 5>how technical do you want to get up?</v>

2203
01:01:36.071 --> 01:01:36.590
<v Speaker 5>Get in there.</v>

2204
01:01:36.590 --> 01:01:37.423
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

2205
01:01:38.390 --> 01:01:39.920
<v Speaker 5>Sapphires are really hard material.</v>

2206
01:01:39.921 --> 01:01:41.840
<v Speaker 5>They'd been using it on watch faces for a long time.</v>

2207
01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:42.860
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't scratch easily.</v>

2208
01:01:42.861 --> 01:01:44.030
<v Speaker 5>If you buy a Rolex or something,</v>

2209
01:01:44.031 --> 01:01:46.220
<v Speaker 5>it's probably got a sapphire face or something like that,</v>

2210
01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:47.193
<v Speaker 5>something like that.</v>

2211
01:01:47.690 --> 01:01:50.150
<v Speaker 5>But it's really expensive and it's really brittle.</v>

2212
01:01:50.210 --> 01:01:53.000
<v Speaker 5>So for a flexible surface it would be shit,</v>

2213
01:01:53.180 --> 01:01:54.230
<v Speaker 5>shit shitty.</v>

2214
01:01:54.410 --> 01:01:57.260
<v Speaker 5>And what a lot of people don't realize is that even if you have a,</v>

2215
01:01:57.500 --> 01:01:58.281
<v Speaker 5>a stiff phone,</v>

2216
01:01:58.281 --> 01:01:59.114
<v Speaker 5>like an iPhone,</v>

2217
01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:03.080
<v Speaker 5>there's a certain amount of flex that it can put up with without chipping or</v>

2218
01:02:03.081 --> 01:02:04.490
<v Speaker 5>shattering like something like this.</v>

2219
01:02:04.491 --> 01:02:05.060
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2220
01:02:05.060 --> 01:02:06.110
<v Speaker 5>you can put some force on it,</v>

2221
01:02:06.111 --> 01:02:06.944
<v Speaker 5>you could sit on it,</v>

2222
01:02:06.980 --> 01:02:07.491
<v Speaker 5>et cetera.</v>

2223
01:02:07.491 --> 01:02:11.450
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't crack when you bend over type stuff or chip very easily,</v>

2224
01:02:11.451 --> 01:02:12.980
<v Speaker 5>although people crack them anyway,</v>

2225
01:02:13.030 --> 01:02:13.521
<v Speaker 5>smash him.</v>

2226
01:02:13.521 --> 01:02:14.090
<v Speaker 5>Anyways,</v>

2227
01:02:14.090 --> 01:02:16.550
<v Speaker 5>so co companies came out with things like gorilla glass,</v>

2228
01:02:16.551 --> 01:02:21.551
<v Speaker 5>which are these flexible kinds of glass that are made out of a laminated Paulie</v>

2229
01:02:21.781 --> 01:02:22.770
<v Speaker 5>type bullshit.</v>

2230
01:02:22.771 --> 01:02:23.880
<v Speaker 5>A little bit of everything in there,</v>

2231
01:02:23.881 --> 01:02:24.714
<v Speaker 5>some glass,</v>

2232
01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:25.800
<v Speaker 5>some minerals,</v>

2233
01:02:25.801 --> 01:02:26.634
<v Speaker 5>some plastic.</v>

2234
01:02:26.700 --> 01:02:27.810
<v Speaker 5>These new Sapphire one,</v>

2235
01:02:27.811 --> 01:02:30.990
<v Speaker 5>which is supposed to be patented by apple is supposed to be the strongest we've</v>

2236
01:02:30.991 --> 01:02:31.824
<v Speaker 5>ever seen.</v>

2237
01:02:32.010 --> 01:02:36.090
<v Speaker 5>So fewer people are going to end up in the apple store with a cracked iPhone.</v>

2238
01:02:36.270 --> 01:02:36.751
<v Speaker 5>Essentially.</v>

2239
01:02:36.751 --> 01:02:36.891
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>

2240
01:02:36.891 --> 01:02:38.820
<v Speaker 5>that's the way it's looking right now.</v>

2241
01:02:39.090 --> 01:02:40.860
<v Speaker 5>So my Buddy Marquez,</v>

2242
01:02:40.890 --> 01:02:41.760
<v Speaker 5>who we talked about earlier,</v>

2243
01:02:42.450 --> 01:02:47.190
<v Speaker 5>God is hands on and through a very similar source to who I've gotten my hands on</v>

2244
01:02:47.191 --> 01:02:48.300
<v Speaker 5>components from before.</v>

2245
01:02:48.690 --> 01:02:50.790
<v Speaker 5>Got His hands on this glass.</v>

2246
01:02:50.820 --> 01:02:51.653
<v Speaker 5>Supposedly,</v>

2247
01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:52.553
<v Speaker 5>allegedly,</v>

2248
01:02:52.770 --> 01:02:53.220
<v Speaker 5>whatever.</v>

2249
01:02:53.220 --> 01:02:53.490
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2250
01:02:53.490 --> 01:02:53.880
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2251
01:02:53.880 --> 01:02:54.301
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

2252
01:02:54.301 --> 01:02:55.980
<v Speaker 5>A definitiveness there.</v>

2253
01:02:55.981 --> 01:02:57.410
<v Speaker 5>But what we think is the,</v>

2254
01:02:57.411 --> 01:02:58.290
<v Speaker 5>the upcoming glass,</v>

2255
01:02:58.410 --> 01:02:59.410
<v Speaker 5>put it through its paces,</v>

2256
01:02:59.411 --> 01:03:00.420
<v Speaker 5>it scratched it with a knife,</v>

2257
01:03:00.421 --> 01:03:01.980
<v Speaker 5>scratched it with keys,</v>

2258
01:03:02.070 --> 01:03:02.940
<v Speaker 5>would not scratch,</v>

2259
01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:03.600
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

2260
01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:04.470
<v Speaker 5>Very durable.</v>

2261
01:03:05.220 --> 01:03:06.330
<v Speaker 5>But I met,</v>

2262
01:03:06.390 --> 01:03:08.250
<v Speaker 5>I was unimpressed because I said,</v>

2263
01:03:08.251 --> 01:03:08.790
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2264
01:03:08.790 --> 01:03:10.350
<v Speaker 5>we need to bust the thing.</v>

2265
01:03:10.351 --> 01:03:12.390
<v Speaker 5>We can need to take the thing to the point of destruction.</v>

2266
01:03:12.420 --> 01:03:13.290
<v Speaker 5>This is not enough.</v>

2267
01:03:13.530 --> 01:03:14.490
<v Speaker 5>And I wasn't the only one.</v>

2268
01:03:14.491 --> 01:03:15.810
<v Speaker 5>There were people in the comments that were like,</v>

2269
01:03:16.110 --> 01:03:16.740
<v Speaker 5>well dude,</v>

2270
01:03:16.740 --> 01:03:17.573
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

2271
01:03:17.830 --> 01:03:18.930
<v Speaker 5>he did a great video.</v>

2272
01:03:18.931 --> 01:03:19.530
<v Speaker 5>So he,</v>

2273
01:03:19.530 --> 01:03:20.311
<v Speaker 5>he doesn't deserve it.</v>

2274
01:03:20.311 --> 01:03:20.731
<v Speaker 5>But they were like,</v>

2275
01:03:20.731 --> 01:03:21.510
<v Speaker 5>well dude,</v>

2276
01:03:21.510 --> 01:03:22.920
<v Speaker 5>sure you bent it and scratched it,</v>

2277
01:03:22.921 --> 01:03:24.390
<v Speaker 5>but at what point is it,</v>

2278
01:03:24.540 --> 01:03:25.650
<v Speaker 5>is it going to be destroyed?</v>

2279
01:03:26.340 --> 01:03:27.173
<v Speaker 5>And so,</v>

2280
01:03:27.260 --> 01:03:27.690
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2281
01:03:27.690 --> 01:03:28.710
<v Speaker 5>we wanted to test that.</v>

2282
01:03:28.711 --> 01:03:31.680
<v Speaker 5>So I sent him a message where I said,</v>

2283
01:03:31.890 --> 01:03:32.251
<v Speaker 5>listen,</v>

2284
01:03:32.251 --> 01:03:32.551
<v Speaker 5>me,</v>

2285
01:03:32.551 --> 01:03:33.384
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

2286
01:03:33.450 --> 01:03:34.920
<v Speaker 5>let's figure out how to get this done.</v>

2287
01:03:35.220 --> 01:03:35.641
<v Speaker 5>I think,</v>

2288
01:03:35.641 --> 01:03:35.880
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2289
01:03:35.880 --> 01:03:37.200
<v Speaker 5>maybe we should go to a gun range.</v>

2290
01:03:37.201 --> 01:03:38.340
<v Speaker 5>That's what I said to him at first.</v>

2291
01:03:38.870 --> 01:03:39.121
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>

2292
01:03:39.121 --> 01:03:39.210
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

2293
01:03:39.210 --> 01:03:39.511
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>

2294
01:03:39.511 --> 01:03:39.720
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

2295
01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:40.021
<v Speaker 5>He said,</v>

2296
01:03:40.021 --> 01:03:40.500
<v Speaker 5>on Dm,</v>

2297
01:03:40.500 --> 01:03:40.761
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>

2298
01:03:40.761 --> 01:03:41.850
<v Speaker 5>have you ever been to a gun range?</v>

2299
01:03:42.150 --> 01:03:42.481
<v Speaker 5>He said,</v>

2300
01:03:42.481 --> 01:03:43.410
<v Speaker 5>I like where this is going.</v>

2301
01:03:43.980 --> 01:03:45.180
<v Speaker 5>Then I responded with,</v>

2302
01:03:45.270 --> 01:03:46.590
<v Speaker 5>I think I can do one better.</v>

2303
01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:47.790
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>

2304
01:03:47.790 --> 01:03:47.921
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2305
01:03:47.921 --> 01:03:48.930
<v Speaker 5>you think about an arrow.</v>

2306
01:03:49.050 --> 01:03:49.830
<v Speaker 5>He said,</v>

2307
01:03:49.830 --> 01:03:50.461
<v Speaker 5>sold,</v>

2308
01:03:50.461 --> 01:03:51.030
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2309
01:03:51.030 --> 01:03:51.480
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>

2310
01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:53.370
<v Speaker 5>let me reach out to maybe reach out to Joe.</v>

2311
01:03:53.970 --> 01:03:55.560
<v Speaker 5>So then I sent a message to Joe.</v>

2312
01:03:55.940 --> 01:03:56.490
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

2313
01:03:56.490 --> 01:03:57.510
<v Speaker 5>it was kind of vague.</v>

2314
01:03:57.570 --> 01:03:59.010
<v Speaker 5>I liked the way it was phrased though.</v>

2315
01:03:59.700 --> 01:04:00.091
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>

2316
01:04:00.091 --> 01:04:04.710
<v Speaker 5>leaked iPhone Sapphire screen in Arrow in a high speed camera.</v>

2317
01:04:05.610 --> 01:04:05.941
<v Speaker 5>That was it.</v>

2318
01:04:05.941 --> 01:04:06.151
<v Speaker 5>Dot,</v>

2319
01:04:06.151 --> 01:04:06.331
<v Speaker 5>dot.</v>

2320
01:04:06.331 --> 01:04:06.940
<v Speaker 5>Dot.</v>

2321
01:04:06.940 --> 01:04:07.773
<v Speaker 5>What are you think about that?</v>

2322
01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:09.450
<v Speaker 5>And he responded with,</v>

2323
01:04:09.690 --> 01:04:10.560
<v Speaker 5>Fuck Yeah,</v>

2324
01:04:11.050 --> 01:04:11.940
<v Speaker 5>you hear me folks?</v>

2325
01:04:12.180 --> 01:04:13.380
<v Speaker 5>No hesitation.</v>

2326
01:04:13.710 --> 01:04:14.543
<v Speaker 5>Fuck Ya.</v>

2327
01:04:14.730 --> 01:04:15.740
<v Speaker 5>Right in the DM.</v>

2328
01:04:15.950 --> 01:04:17.430
<v Speaker 5>And that's what I love about this guy right here.</v>

2329
01:04:17.670 --> 01:04:19.290
<v Speaker 5>So we came down and we did it.</v>

2330
01:04:19.291 --> 01:04:21.240
<v Speaker 5>We made it happen in the video is going to go live.</v>

2331
01:04:21.241 --> 01:04:25.950
<v Speaker 5>I have a shit ton of data to look through because this camera's shooting at nine</v>

2332
01:04:25.951 --> 01:04:27.090
<v Speaker 5>60 fps,</v>

2333
01:04:27.330 --> 01:04:28.330
<v Speaker 5>which we,</v>

2334
01:04:28.470 --> 01:04:30.360
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to have the calculation wrong here,</v>

2335
01:04:30.361 --> 01:04:33.360
<v Speaker 5>but essentially an eight second clip is an enormous amount of footage.</v>

2336
01:04:33.361 --> 01:04:36.270
<v Speaker 5>It's like minutes worth so over over a minute.</v>

2337
01:04:36.300 --> 01:04:39.330
<v Speaker 5>960 frames per second.</v>

2338
01:04:39.420 --> 01:04:42.270
<v Speaker 5>That's what we shot it at the impact and 60.</v>

2339
01:04:42.660 --> 01:04:42.871
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2340
01:04:42.871 --> 01:04:43.960
<v Speaker 5>it turned out it was,</v>

2341
01:04:43.970 --> 01:04:47.640
<v Speaker 5>it was like one minute of video equals one second.</v>

2342
01:04:47.700 --> 01:04:48.533
<v Speaker 5>Was that the,</v>

2343
01:04:48.950 --> 01:04:49.560
<v Speaker 5>is that,</v>

2344
01:04:49.560 --> 01:04:50.070
<v Speaker 5>is that it?</v>

2345
01:04:50.070 --> 01:04:50.903
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

2346
01:04:51.060 --> 01:04:53.340
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to go on record as,</v>

2347
01:04:53.510 --> 01:04:56.010
<v Speaker 5>as cause I'm going to be wrong if I do go on record,</v>

2348
01:04:56.011 --> 01:04:58.110
<v Speaker 5>but for those that are really into this shit,</v>

2349
01:04:58.111 --> 01:05:03.111
<v Speaker 5>we were shooting on a an fs 700 at the highest frame rate possible and uh,</v>

2350
01:05:03.780 --> 01:05:06.510
<v Speaker 5>and basically we're going to try and give you guys the most accurate</v>

2351
01:05:06.511 --> 01:05:08.400
<v Speaker 5>representation of the impact that we can.</v>

2352
01:05:08.670 --> 01:05:09.780
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

2353
01:05:09.960 --> 01:05:11.670
<v Speaker 5>I mean I'm not going to spill it here.</v>

2354
01:05:11.730 --> 01:05:14.940
<v Speaker 5>We got to leave a little reason to go check out the video,</v>

2355
01:05:15.330 --> 01:05:16.163
<v Speaker 5>but uh,</v>

2356
01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:17.130
<v Speaker 5>interesting results.</v>

2357
01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:18.340
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>

2358
01:05:18.340 --> 01:05:19.390
<v Speaker 2>we're not going to spill it,</v>

2359
01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:21.070
<v Speaker 2>but guess who wins?</v>

2360
01:05:22.990 --> 01:05:24.220
<v Speaker 2>We did some other stuff too.</v>

01:05:24.310 --> 01:05:25.143
<v Speaker 2>Not The phone.</v>

2362

2403
01:06:18.791 --> 01:06:20.380
<v Speaker 2>We got in front of the scenes.</v>

2404
01:06:21.070 --> 01:06:22.630
<v Speaker 2>This is destruction at its best.</v>

2405
01:06:22.660 --> 01:06:23.500
<v Speaker 2>It was awesome.</v>

2406
01:06:23.770 --> 01:06:24.603
<v Speaker 2>It went down.</v>

2407
01:06:25.900 --> 01:06:26.733
<v Speaker 2>Go watch a video.</v>

2408
01:06:27.170 --> 01:06:27.560
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>

2409
01:06:27.560 --> 01:06:29.550
<v Speaker 2>what is it about men that uh,</v>

2410
01:06:29.620 --> 01:06:30.670
<v Speaker 2>we were talking about this,</v>

2411
01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:30.990
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2412
01:06:30.990 --> 01:06:33.460
<v Speaker 2>Like men wanting to shoot things and blow them up.</v>

2413
01:06:33.710 --> 01:06:36.340
<v Speaker 2>Like if you had to compare like the numbers,</v>

2414
01:06:36.341 --> 01:06:37.250
<v Speaker 2>just the sheer numbers.</v>

2415
01:06:37.260 --> 01:06:38.440
<v Speaker 2>Forget about how many people are gay.</v>

2416
01:06:38.680 --> 01:06:41.620
<v Speaker 2>The sheer number of things of things that go blown out by men.</v>

2417
01:06:41.950 --> 01:06:42.760
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2418
01:06:42.760 --> 01:06:44.240
<v Speaker 2>like what does my holes,</v>

2419
01:06:45.220 --> 01:06:46.053
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2420
01:06:46.120 --> 01:06:47.920
<v Speaker 2>No checks to stick and firecrackers up there.</v>

2421
01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:50.110
<v Speaker 2>But I think things that get like,</v>

2422
01:06:50.380 --> 01:06:52.240
<v Speaker 2>like blown up in a field,</v>

2423
01:06:52.510 --> 01:06:55.870
<v Speaker 2>how many things get blown up in the field that are growing up?</v>

2424
01:06:55.871 --> 01:06:57.070
<v Speaker 2>I used to fish,</v>

2425
01:06:57.490 --> 01:07:01.650
<v Speaker 2>he used to put firecrackers in their mouth and just blow them up after fishing.</v>

2426
01:07:02.190 --> 01:07:03.023
<v Speaker 2>That's so rude.</v>

2427
01:07:03.050 --> 01:07:03.581
<v Speaker 2>You should be,</v>

2428
01:07:03.581 --> 01:07:05.670
<v Speaker 2>you should be on some watch list somewhere.</v>

2429
01:07:05.680 --> 01:07:07.250
<v Speaker 2>You know that you weren't before.</v>

2430
01:07:07.930 --> 01:07:08.763
<v Speaker 2>You are now.</v>

2431
01:07:08.860 --> 01:07:09.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2432
01:07:09.360 --> 01:07:09.890
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2433
01:07:09.890 --> 01:07:11.260
<v Speaker 2>then like,</v>

2434
01:07:11.380 --> 01:07:14.470
<v Speaker 2>like how many different like refrigerators have been like stuffed full of</v>

2435
01:07:14.471 --> 01:07:15.304
<v Speaker 2>dynamite.</v>

2436
01:07:15.460 --> 01:07:16.290
<v Speaker 2>It's all men.</v>

2437
01:07:16.290 --> 01:07:16.870
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2438
01:07:16.870 --> 01:07:19.930
<v Speaker 2>When I was a kid I had an obsession with like opening stuff like this up.</v>

2439
01:07:20.440 --> 01:07:24.250
<v Speaker 2>They would by my parents would buy me some awesome piece of technology and I</v>

2440
01:07:24.251 --> 01:07:29.020
<v Speaker 2>would want to get inside of it like keyboards and Walkmans.</v>

2441
01:07:29.021 --> 01:07:30.760
<v Speaker 2>I used to open those up wow.</v>

2442
01:07:30.820 --> 01:07:32.290
<v Speaker 2>To just see what they were made of.</v>

2443
01:07:32.800 --> 01:07:34.300
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if this is an extension of that,</v>

2444
01:07:34.301 --> 01:07:37.240
<v Speaker 2>but ultimately you get to see what the thing is made of.</v>

2445
01:07:37.330 --> 01:07:38.163
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

2446
01:07:38.500 --> 01:07:42.430
<v Speaker 2>That's part of it I think for sure to see inside.</v>

2447
01:07:42.431 --> 01:07:43.360
<v Speaker 2>Once you shoot it,</v>

2448
01:07:43.420 --> 01:07:44.253
<v Speaker 2>look inside,</v>

2449
01:07:44.470 --> 01:07:45.820
<v Speaker 2>but blowing things up.</v>

2450
01:07:46.040 --> 01:07:48.080
<v Speaker 2>It's also just to just blow things up.</v>

2451
01:07:48.110 --> 01:07:48.521
<v Speaker 2>You're right,</v>

2452
01:07:48.521 --> 01:07:48.910
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>

2453
01:07:48.910 --> 01:07:49.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm stretching on that.</v>

2454
01:07:49.931 --> 01:07:52.450
<v Speaker 2>I was trying to put a student on the two different desires,</v>

2455
01:07:52.451 --> 01:07:56.050
<v Speaker 2>like your desire is like the desire to see the wiring under the board,</v>

2456
01:07:56.370 --> 01:07:58.450
<v Speaker 2>which all real when the also,</v>

2457
01:07:58.451 --> 01:07:59.380
<v Speaker 2>when the Arrow hits it,</v>

2458
01:07:59.410 --> 01:08:02.380
<v Speaker 2>like we're so used to seeing this in the context of Ooh,</v>

2459
01:08:02.381 --> 01:08:03.214
<v Speaker 2>don't drop it.</v>

2460
01:08:04.060 --> 01:08:07.810
<v Speaker 2>Don't spill on it to see it in that light where fuck you.</v>

2461
01:08:07.900 --> 01:08:09.370
<v Speaker 2>You know this thing,</v>

2462
01:08:09.450 --> 01:08:09.820
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

2463
01:08:09.820 --> 01:08:12.820
<v Speaker 2>that you've been so concerned about for so long,</v>

2464
01:08:13.210 --> 01:08:13.601
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2465
01:08:13.601 --> 01:08:14.560
<v Speaker 2>yet gentle with it.</v>

2466
01:08:14.561 --> 01:08:14.990
<v Speaker 2>You Bait,</v>

2467
01:08:14.990 --> 01:08:16.220
<v Speaker 2>we fucking baby</v>

2468
01:08:16.220 --> 01:08:17.053
<v Speaker 5>these things.</v>

2469
01:08:17.060 --> 01:08:17.690
<v Speaker 5>True.</v>

2470
01:08:17.690 --> 01:08:18.021
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>

2471
01:08:18.021 --> 01:08:19.070
<v Speaker 5>And so to take the,</v>

2472
01:08:19.250 --> 01:08:21.410
<v Speaker 5>to take this thing that's on your conscience all the time.</v>

2473
01:08:21.411 --> 01:08:21.861
<v Speaker 5>Where is it?</v>

2474
01:08:21.861 --> 01:08:22.970
<v Speaker 5>Do I have it is in my pocket,</v>

2475
01:08:23.020 --> 01:08:23.480
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2476
01:08:23.480 --> 01:08:24.620
<v Speaker 5>Who doesn't do the slap?</v>

2477
01:08:24.890 --> 01:08:25.723
<v Speaker 5>The slap,</v>

2478
01:08:25.970 --> 01:08:26.340
<v Speaker 5>slap.</v>

2479
01:08:26.340 --> 01:08:28.190
<v Speaker 5>Did Wallet Phone.</v>

2480
01:08:28.370 --> 01:08:30.260
<v Speaker 5>You don't leave that premises until it's in there.</v>

2481
01:08:30.680 --> 01:08:31.461
<v Speaker 5>So to say,</v>

2482
01:08:31.461 --> 01:08:32.030
<v Speaker 5>fuck it.</v>

2483
01:08:32.030 --> 01:08:32.863
<v Speaker 5>Even for a minute,</v>

2484
01:08:32.930 --> 01:08:33.860
<v Speaker 5>even for a second,</v>

2485
01:08:33.890 --> 01:08:34.723
<v Speaker 5>that's a win.</v>

2486
01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:40.250
<v Speaker 5>Or you're just destroying getting off on the fact you destroy things.</v>

2487
01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:41.713
<v Speaker 5>But if it was,</v>

2488
01:08:41.810 --> 01:08:42.800
<v Speaker 5>I mean it was cool,</v>

2489
01:08:42.920 --> 01:08:43.191
<v Speaker 5>but like,</v>

2490
01:08:43.191 --> 01:08:44.840
<v Speaker 5>let's say we put some,</v>

2491
01:08:45.260 --> 01:08:45.561
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>

2492
01:08:45.561 --> 01:08:47.870
<v Speaker 5>a fucking banana there wouldn't have been quite the same.</v>

2493
01:08:48.350 --> 01:08:48.900
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2494
01:08:48.900 --> 01:08:49.171
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2495
01:08:49.171 --> 01:08:51.600
<v Speaker 1>definitely more valuable things are cool to see.</v>

2496
01:08:51.601 --> 01:08:52.800
<v Speaker 1>Explode for whatever.</v>

2497
01:08:55.800 --> 01:08:56.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2498
01:08:56.370 --> 01:08:57.031
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>

2499
01:08:57.031 --> 01:08:57.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2500
01:08:57.480 --> 01:08:58.230
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2501
01:08:58.230 --> 01:08:58.980
<v Speaker 1>what was I gonna say?</v>

2502
01:08:58.980 --> 01:08:59.131
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2503
01:08:59.131 --> 01:09:00.270
<v Speaker 1>exploding things.</v>

2504
01:09:00.360 --> 01:09:00.870
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2505
01:09:00.870 --> 01:09:01.703
<v Speaker 1>Whenever I lost it,</v>

2506
01:09:01.860 --> 01:09:03.150
<v Speaker 1>I lost whatever it was.</v>

2507
01:09:04.160 --> 01:09:05.030
<v Speaker 5>It's exciting.</v>

2508
01:09:05.031 --> 01:09:05.300
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2509
01:09:05.300 --> 01:09:05.931
<v Speaker 5>there's also this,</v>

2510
01:09:05.931 --> 01:09:08.990
<v Speaker 5>just from a very straight up primal perspective,</v>

2511
01:09:08.991 --> 01:09:12.230
<v Speaker 5>this idea of the impending doom.</v>

2512
01:09:12.950 --> 01:09:13.551
<v Speaker 5>As a viewer,</v>

2513
01:09:13.551 --> 01:09:14.360
<v Speaker 5>you get to wait,</v>

2514
01:09:14.360 --> 01:09:15.350
<v Speaker 5>you get to watch,</v>

2515
01:09:15.440 --> 01:09:16.610
<v Speaker 5>but you know the outcome.</v>

2516
01:09:16.970 --> 01:09:18.560
<v Speaker 5>You already know what the fuck's going to happen,</v>

2517
01:09:18.561 --> 01:09:20.090
<v Speaker 5>but you need to see it happen anyways.</v>

2518
01:09:20.510 --> 01:09:21.343
<v Speaker 5>I know what I was going to say.</v>

2519
01:09:21.350 --> 01:09:22.430
<v Speaker 5>BLENDTEC blenders.</v>

2520
01:09:22.431 --> 01:09:24.310
<v Speaker 5>You ever seen that with a plan?</v>

2521
01:09:24.680 --> 01:09:25.311
<v Speaker 5>With a band?</v>

2522
01:09:25.311 --> 01:09:26.144
<v Speaker 5>It's crazy.</v>

2523
01:09:26.510 --> 01:09:27.770
<v Speaker 5>They blend the fucking iPhone.</v>

2524
01:09:27.771 --> 01:09:28.700
<v Speaker 5>They blend a shout.</v>

2525
01:09:28.770 --> 01:09:30.080
<v Speaker 5>I've got dude blends.</v>

2526
01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:31.900
<v Speaker 3>My Vitamix couldn't take.</v>

2527
01:09:31.940 --> 01:09:35.510
<v Speaker 3>I have a Vitamix and I blend tech and it couldn't do a pineapple.</v>

2528
01:09:35.570 --> 01:09:36.291
<v Speaker 3>I cut up,</v>

2529
01:09:36.291 --> 01:09:36.681
<v Speaker 3>pop it up,</v>

2530
01:09:36.681 --> 01:09:37.514
<v Speaker 3>pineapple in there.</v>

2531
01:09:37.780 --> 01:09:38.613
<v Speaker 3>It just overheat.</v>

2532
01:09:38.700 --> 01:09:39.980
<v Speaker 3>Kept on overheating.</v>

2533
01:09:40.220 --> 01:09:43.160
<v Speaker 3>But luckily there's a sensor in there that you just have to unplug it and wait</v>

2534
01:09:43.161 --> 01:09:44.360
<v Speaker 3>30 minutes and shit.</v>

2535
01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:45.021
<v Speaker 3>But I'm like,</v>

2536
01:09:45.021 --> 01:09:45.561
<v Speaker 3>wait a second,</v>

2537
01:09:45.561 --> 01:09:47.750
<v Speaker 3>why can't this shit do a pineapple?</v>

2538
01:09:47.751 --> 01:09:50.510
<v Speaker 3>But like he got to man up and get the tech man.</v>

2539
01:09:50.900 --> 01:09:51.260
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2540
01:09:51.260 --> 01:09:51.680
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno.</v>

2541
01:09:51.680 --> 01:09:53.000
<v Speaker 1>I enjoyed the Vitamix.</v>

2542
01:09:53.001 --> 01:09:54.140
<v Speaker 1>You know what I like about the Vitamix,</v>

2543
01:09:54.141 --> 01:09:55.070
<v Speaker 1>that plunger thing?</v>

2544
01:09:55.071 --> 01:09:55.371
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2545
01:09:55.371 --> 01:09:56.690
<v Speaker 1>The plunger think is nice,</v>

2546
01:09:56.720 --> 01:09:58.880
<v Speaker 1>but I never used it for anything other than Kale shakes.</v>

2547
01:09:58.910 --> 01:09:59.540
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2548
01:09:59.540 --> 01:10:00.140
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

2549
01:10:00.140 --> 01:10:01.130
<v Speaker 1>it's perfect for Kale.</v>

2550
01:10:01.131 --> 01:10:01.964
<v Speaker 1>Shakes works great,</v>

2551
01:10:02.120 --> 01:10:05.740
<v Speaker 1>but the blend techs better even for Kale shakes cause it really liquefies it,</v>

2552
01:10:05.741 --> 01:10:08.090
<v Speaker 1>it brings it down to like a much smaller,</v>

2553
01:10:08.660 --> 01:10:10.930
<v Speaker 1>smaller size particle does it?</v>

2554
01:10:11.170 --> 01:10:14.420
<v Speaker 3>I used my Blendtec though every day or my Vitamix everyday.</v>

2555
01:10:14.421 --> 01:10:15.770
<v Speaker 3>Like even if I'm just getting like,</v>

2556
01:10:15.771 --> 01:10:15.981
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

2557
01:10:15.981 --> 01:10:17.000
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna get some apple juice,</v>

2558
01:10:17.001 --> 01:10:19.770
<v Speaker 3>I'll put some apple juice and ice in it and make it like a frozen I,</v>

2559
01:10:19.780 --> 01:10:20.660
<v Speaker 3>it's good man.</v>

2560
01:10:21.040 --> 01:10:21.790
<v Speaker 3>It's good.</v>

2561
01:10:21.790 --> 01:10:22.200
<v Speaker 1>I mean you,</v>

2562
01:10:22.200 --> 01:10:26.470
<v Speaker 1>you should look if the more you could give your digestive system a break,</v>

2563
01:10:26.510 --> 01:10:27.850
<v Speaker 1>blend shit up like that.</v>

2564
01:10:28.030 --> 01:10:28.870
<v Speaker 1>Like vegetables.</v>

2565
01:10:29.300 --> 01:10:30.133
<v Speaker 1>It's good for you.</v>

2566
01:10:30.530 --> 01:10:30.851
<v Speaker 1>It's good.</v>

2567
01:10:30.851 --> 01:10:31.830
<v Speaker 1>It helps you poop too.</v>

2568
01:10:32.200 --> 01:10:33.033

2569
01:10:33.310 --> 01:10:35.230
<v Speaker 1>that's the best thing about those Kale shakes.</v>

2570
01:10:35.410 --> 01:10:36.880
<v Speaker 1>The poops are fantastic.</v>

2571
01:10:37.210 --> 01:10:37.940
<v Speaker 1>I need help there,</v>

01:10:38.820 --> 01:10:40.290
<v Speaker 1>I guess I got to jump on a killed train.</v>

2574
01:10:40.291 --> 01:10:41.950
<v Speaker 1>Still Wild Log ride.</v>

2575
01:10:41.951 --> 01:10:42.220
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2576
01:10:42.220 --> 01:10:46.250
<v Speaker 1>like you're working on the Yukon and there's a river and then the,</v>

2577
01:10:46.251 --> 01:10:49.810
<v Speaker 1>the logs broke loose and they went down current leg.</v>

2578
01:10:49.930 --> 01:10:50.890
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

2579

2580
01:10:52.601 --> 01:10:53.081
<v Speaker 1>it's just like,</v>

2581
01:10:53.081 --> 01:10:53.740
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

2582
01:10:53.740 --> 01:10:54.573
<v Speaker 1>hang on.</v>

2583
01:10:54.880 --> 01:10:55.900
<v Speaker 1>Just hang on.</v>

2584
01:10:55.901 --> 01:10:56.590
<v Speaker 1>Perfect.</v>

2585
01:10:56.590 --> 01:10:57.730
<v Speaker 1>Whew.</v>

2586
01:10:58.240 --> 01:10:59.230
<v Speaker 1>And then you'd be thinking like,</v>

2587
01:10:59.231 --> 01:11:00.910
<v Speaker 1>why hasn't my shit always like this?</v>

2588
01:11:00.911 --> 01:11:01.750
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you know,</v>

2589
01:11:01.770 --> 01:11:03.010
<v Speaker 1>you're going to think I gotta take a shit.</v>

2590
01:11:03.011 --> 01:11:03.880
<v Speaker 1>I definitely have to take a shit.</v>

2591
01:11:04.270 --> 01:11:04.571
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

2592
01:11:04.571 --> 01:11:06.000
<v Speaker 1>let me just sit here and wait for this to come out.</v>

2593
01:11:06.670 --> 01:11:07.660
<v Speaker 1>How long should it shit?</v>

2594
01:11:07.690 --> 01:11:08.980
<v Speaker 1>How long should you be in there for?</v>

2595
01:11:09.130 --> 01:11:10.420
<v Speaker 1>How long should it be sitting down for?</v>

2596
01:11:10.810 --> 01:11:13.000
<v Speaker 1>It's really truly dependent on your diet,</v>

2597
01:11:13.410 --> 01:11:13.860
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2598
01:11:13.860 --> 01:11:14.693
<v Speaker 1>I think</v>

2599
01:11:14.730 --> 01:11:17.200
<v Speaker 2>the easier it is for you to shit for you,</v>

2600
01:11:17.220 --> 01:11:19.830
<v Speaker 2>for Joe Rogan and experiencing in the bathroom.</v>

2601
01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:21.930
<v Speaker 2>What's the perfect length of time?</v>

2602
01:11:21.960 --> 01:11:25.170
<v Speaker 2>It depends on if I have my phone with me cause sometimes I'll drag it out.</v>

2603
01:11:25.190 --> 01:11:26.100
<v Speaker 2>Even when I'm done,</v>

2604
01:11:26.910 --> 01:11:28.980
<v Speaker 2>we're good magazine or a book that I'm into,</v>

2605
01:11:28.981 --> 01:11:31.580
<v Speaker 2>I'll drag it out like I'm done shitting finished.</v>

2606
01:11:31.790 --> 01:11:32.191
<v Speaker 2>What is,</v>

2607
01:11:32.191 --> 01:11:33.360
<v Speaker 2>don't feel like pulling my pants up.</v>

2608
01:11:33.361 --> 01:11:36.930
<v Speaker 2>What kind of have you said or what's your record for time after you've been</v>

2609
01:11:36.931 --> 01:11:38.910
<v Speaker 2>finished for still chilling with the phone.</v>

2610
01:11:38.940 --> 01:11:40.470
<v Speaker 2>My legs go numb all the time.</v>

2611
01:11:40.890 --> 01:11:41.723
<v Speaker 2>Tell you that</v>

2612
01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:47.310
<v Speaker 2>especially when you got the iPhone are aren't used to have a joke about it.</v>

2613
01:11:47.311 --> 01:11:48.150
<v Speaker 2>So true.</v>

2614
01:11:48.300 --> 01:11:48.601
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2615
01:11:48.601 --> 01:11:53.601
<v Speaker 2>you get that iPhone resting on your elbows and your thighs and you're leaning</v>

2616
01:11:53.761 --> 01:11:57.360
<v Speaker 2>forward and you're just cutting off all that out your legs essentially.</v>

2617
01:11:57.690 --> 01:11:58.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2618
01:11:58.260 --> 01:12:00.210
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever masturbated on the toilet?</v>

2619
01:12:01.020 --> 01:12:01.830
<v Speaker 3>It's sitting on,</v>

2620
01:12:01.830 --> 01:12:02.790
<v Speaker 3>that's not shading,</v>

2621
01:12:02.791 --> 01:12:04.240
<v Speaker 3>but just sitting on the toilet now</v>

2622
01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:09.120
<v Speaker 3>like I had when the girl was over and I couldn't masturbate in front of her.</v>

2623
01:12:09.121 --> 01:12:10.050
<v Speaker 3>So I would go to the bathroom.</v>

2624
01:12:10.051 --> 01:12:12.450
<v Speaker 3>Like I might take a shower and then you just try to masturbate while sitting on</v>

2625
01:12:12.451 --> 01:12:12.871
<v Speaker 3>the toilet.</v>

2626
01:12:12.871 --> 01:12:13.920
<v Speaker 3>Why don't you just have sex with her?</v>

2627
01:12:13.921 --> 01:12:14.754
<v Speaker 3>She's right there.</v>

2628
01:12:15.320 --> 01:12:16.153
<v Speaker 3>Weren't into it.</v>

2629
01:12:16.260 --> 01:12:16.831
<v Speaker 3>Too much work.</v>

2630
01:12:16.831 --> 01:12:17.610
<v Speaker 3>Too much work.</v>

2631
01:12:17.610 --> 01:12:18.210
<v Speaker 3>Too much work.</v>

2632
01:12:18.210 --> 01:12:18.901
<v Speaker 3>So what happened?</v>

2633
01:12:18.901 --> 01:12:19.061
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

2634
01:12:19.061 --> 01:12:19.331
<v Speaker 3>What was it?</v>

2635
01:12:19.331 --> 01:12:19.821
<v Speaker 3>What was the oak?</v>

2636
01:12:19.821 --> 01:12:20.401
<v Speaker 3>It's really hard.</v>

2637
01:12:20.401 --> 01:12:21.480
<v Speaker 3>Like I've only done it once.</v>

2638
01:12:21.481 --> 01:12:22.680
<v Speaker 3>I've tried like three times.</v>

2639
01:12:23.290 --> 01:12:25.050
<v Speaker 3>Know it's something about the sitting on the toilet.</v>

2640
01:12:25.051 --> 01:12:25.884
<v Speaker 3>It's not.</v>

2641
01:12:25.920 --> 01:12:27.030
<v Speaker 3>It takes you out of position.</v>

2642
01:12:27.031 --> 01:12:28.740
<v Speaker 3>I remember somebody sending me something,</v>

2643
01:12:28.950 --> 01:12:29.641
<v Speaker 3>not a product.</v>

2644
01:12:29.641 --> 01:12:32.790
<v Speaker 3>They want it to send me a product because they say we don't sit on the toilet</v>

2645
01:12:32.791 --> 01:12:35.760
<v Speaker 3>properly and it's distinct to adjust the way you sit.</v>

2646
01:12:36.060 --> 01:12:37.290
<v Speaker 3>Oh thing.</v>

2647
01:12:37.450 --> 01:12:38.520
<v Speaker 3>That's what it was.</v>

2648
01:12:38.521 --> 01:12:40.240
<v Speaker 3>Platforms squat what it was.</v>

2649
01:12:40.920 --> 01:12:41.521
<v Speaker 3>Imagine that.</v>

2650
01:12:41.521 --> 01:12:42.354
<v Speaker 3>Review.</v>

2651
01:12:42.420 --> 01:12:43.320
<v Speaker 3>My God.</v>

2652
01:12:43.410 --> 01:12:43.980
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2653
01:12:43.980 --> 01:12:46.220
<v Speaker 3>That's supposedly the the way you're supposed to have shit.</v>

2654
01:12:46.260 --> 01:12:46.740
<v Speaker 3>I did.</v>

2655
01:12:46.740 --> 01:12:47.491
<v Speaker 3>I looked it up.</v>

2656
01:12:47.491 --> 01:12:48.810
<v Speaker 3>I went to their website and I was like,</v>

2657
01:12:48.811 --> 01:12:49.740
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit.</v>

2658
01:12:49.741 --> 01:12:51.180
<v Speaker 3>Everyone's shitting the wrong way.</v>

2659
01:12:51.450 --> 01:12:52.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2660
01:12:52.140 --> 01:12:52.621
<v Speaker 2>we are.</v>

2661
01:12:52.621 --> 01:12:53.454
<v Speaker 2>That is true.</v>

2662
01:12:53.790 --> 01:12:57.660
<v Speaker 2>It is easier for your bowels to work if you're,</v>

2663
01:12:57.680 --> 01:13:01.780
<v Speaker 2>if it like you can also sort of adjust your posture when you're over.</v>

2664
01:13:01.800 --> 01:13:02.633
<v Speaker 2>It's overtop.</v>

2665
01:13:02.640 --> 01:13:02.851
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2666
01:13:02.851 --> 01:13:06.060
<v Speaker 2>cause I think it's probably the way I'm doing it with my phone while I'm leaning</v>

2667
01:13:06.061 --> 01:13:08.310
<v Speaker 2>forward and I'm saying this is probably the worst worst.</v>

2668
01:13:08.370 --> 01:13:08.790
<v Speaker 2>Like yeah,</v>

2669
01:13:08.790 --> 01:13:13.790
<v Speaker 2>we should do probably go straighten up and like mimic the squatting.</v>

2670
01:13:15.060 --> 01:13:17.100
<v Speaker 2>The perfect technique with Joe Rogan.</v>

2671
01:13:17.101 --> 01:13:17.161
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2672
01:13:17.161 --> 01:13:17.994
<v Speaker 2>This is how you shit.</v>

2673
01:13:18.860 --> 01:13:19.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2674
01:13:19.210 --> 01:13:20.580
<v Speaker 2>Your mom never taught you this?</v>

2675
01:13:20.581 --> 01:13:21.414
<v Speaker 2>I'm here for you.</v>

2676
01:13:21.750 --> 01:13:22.021
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2677
01:13:22.021 --> 01:13:25.440
<v Speaker 2>I think like a squatting sort of a thing like that like with a,</v>

2678
01:13:25.590 --> 01:13:27.720
<v Speaker 2>with a straight back and it'd be the way to do it.</v>

2679
01:13:27.770 --> 01:13:32.180
<v Speaker 3>We got to fix the morning pee Boehner problem because that shit like I still</v>

2680
01:13:32.270 --> 01:13:33.740
<v Speaker 3>like I'm not good at it.</v>

2681
01:13:33.760 --> 01:13:34.130
<v Speaker 3>What's that?</v>

2682
01:13:34.130 --> 01:13:34.720
<v Speaker 3>What do you mean?</v>

2683
01:13:34.720 --> 01:13:38.450
<v Speaker 3>Like where you have to like do that weird position to stand over the toilet and</v>

2684
01:13:38.451 --> 01:13:43.451
<v Speaker 3>puts your boner down just to pee and oh well you just got to just go outside.</v>

2685
01:13:44.150 --> 01:13:46.130
<v Speaker 3>Is that what you do see outside?</v>

2686
01:13:46.131 --> 01:13:46.521
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

2687
01:13:46.521 --> 01:13:47.270
<v Speaker 3>That's what you do.</v>

2688
01:13:47.270 --> 01:13:50.000
<v Speaker 3>Get close to get one one with you have a piss pot.</v>

2689
01:13:50.001 --> 01:13:50.650
<v Speaker 3>Have we talked about this?</v>

2690
01:13:50.650 --> 01:13:51.870
<v Speaker 3>I I have a pissed pie.</v>

2691
01:13:52.690 --> 01:13:52.880
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2692
01:13:52.880 --> 01:13:53.511
<v Speaker 3>it's outside.</v>

2693
01:13:53.511 --> 01:13:54.890
<v Speaker 3>I like to pee outside for some reason.</v>

2694
01:13:54.891 --> 01:13:56.170
<v Speaker 3>It's just more comforting and he's like,</v>

2695
01:13:56.171 --> 01:13:58.840
<v Speaker 3>I'll just walk outside and pee and animal in the pot.</v>

2696
01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:00.650
<v Speaker 3>The pot out there.</v>

2697
01:14:00.680 --> 01:14:03.040
<v Speaker 3>It's a pot that's like a planted pot books,</v>

2698
01:14:04.970 --> 01:14:06.350
<v Speaker 3>little fertilizer for the plants.</v>

2699
01:14:06.500 --> 01:14:07.370
<v Speaker 3>It's not good for it.</v>

2700
01:14:07.371 --> 01:14:07.850
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2701
01:14:07.850 --> 01:14:08.570
<v Speaker 3>not at all.</v>

2702
01:14:08.570 --> 01:14:10.070
<v Speaker 3>Dog piss kills lawns.</v>

2703
01:14:10.071 --> 01:14:10.760
<v Speaker 3>I know that.</v>

2704
01:14:10.760 --> 01:14:12.080
<v Speaker 3>Definitely yellow based</v>

2705
01:14:12.110 --> 01:14:12.943
<v Speaker 2>disaster.</v>

2706
01:14:13.150 --> 01:14:13.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2707
01:14:13.690 --> 01:14:14.190
<v Speaker 2>like the,</v>

2708
01:14:14.190 --> 01:14:16.490
<v Speaker 2>it stops being green and I don't know what's in a dog's pice.</v>

2709
01:14:16.570 --> 01:14:19.990
<v Speaker 2>It's that Monya but it doesn't seem to be the same as a human.</v>

2710
01:14:20.190 --> 01:14:21.580
<v Speaker 2>Like when you pee on the grass,</v>

2711
01:14:21.610 --> 01:14:22.720
<v Speaker 2>like if you pee on your grass,</v>

2712
01:14:22.721 --> 01:14:24.070
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't seem to kill the grass.</v>

2713
01:14:24.370 --> 01:14:25.630
<v Speaker 2>Dog Tastes the same</v>

2714
01:14:29.430 --> 01:14:29.800
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

2715
01:14:29.800 --> 01:14:30.820
<v Speaker 2>But you could smell dog pee.</v>

2716
01:14:30.821 --> 01:14:34.520
<v Speaker 2>It smells like regular P.</v>

2717
01:14:34.520 --> 01:14:35.353
<v Speaker 2>Kathy's disgust.</v>

2718
01:14:36.430 --> 01:14:37.340
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what you're into man.</v>

2719
01:14:37.350 --> 01:14:38.530
<v Speaker 2>But dirty little animals.</v>

2720
01:14:39.190 --> 01:14:39.790
<v Speaker 2>My cat,</v>

2721
01:14:39.790 --> 01:14:40.623
<v Speaker 2>my oldest cat,</v>

2722
01:14:40.630 --> 01:14:40.901
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2723
01:14:40.901 --> 01:14:41.580
<v Speaker 2>she's problems.</v>

2724
01:14:41.580 --> 01:14:43.450
<v Speaker 2>She shits in front of the toilet now.</v>

2725
01:14:43.630 --> 01:14:44.530
<v Speaker 2>She's old as fuck.</v>

2726
01:14:44.531 --> 01:14:49.531
<v Speaker 2>She's 18 right in front of my toilet and it's like great shit or something.</v>

2727
01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:50.433
<v Speaker 2>They'd mess.</v>

2728
01:14:50.560 --> 01:14:52.510
<v Speaker 2>They're getting old when they get old man,</v>

2729
01:14:52.511 --> 01:14:53.500
<v Speaker 2>cat fall apart.</v>

2730
01:14:53.920 --> 01:14:54.380
<v Speaker 2>I mean the,</v>

2731
01:14:54.380 --> 01:14:55.810
<v Speaker 2>the hang in there for a long time.</v>

2732
01:14:55.811 --> 01:14:56.351
<v Speaker 2>Like my cats,</v>

2733
01:14:56.351 --> 01:14:58.060
<v Speaker 2>18 fucking years old.</v>

2734
01:14:58.420 --> 01:14:59.141
<v Speaker 2>She's hanging in there,</v>

2735
01:14:59.141 --> 01:14:59.974
<v Speaker 2>but every night,</v>

2736
01:15:03.180 --> 01:15:04.960
<v Speaker 2>well she doesn't know what's going on.</v>

2737
01:15:04.990 --> 01:15:05.860
<v Speaker 2>She's 18,</v>

2738
01:15:06.380 --> 01:15:09.490
<v Speaker 2>she's probably got some sort of a neurological issue.</v>

2739
01:15:10.210 --> 01:15:12.730
<v Speaker 2>Some Alzheimer's can get Alzheimer's or something like that,</v>

2740
01:15:13.120 --> 01:15:13.930
<v Speaker 2>but she'll,</v>

2741
01:15:13.930 --> 01:15:15.830
<v Speaker 2>she just a racist as fuck shit up,</v>

2742
01:15:16.810 --> 01:15:18.400
<v Speaker 2>screaming in words that night.</v>

2743
01:15:18.970 --> 01:15:20.230
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know if she can,</v>

2744
01:15:20.260 --> 01:15:21.093
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2745
01:15:21.280 --> 01:15:24.700
<v Speaker 2>she remembers where the litter boxes or she's to litter boxes in the house,</v>

2746
01:15:24.820 --> 01:15:28.060
<v Speaker 2>but sometimes she's in the bathroom and she'll just shit in the wrong bathroom</v>

2747
01:15:28.061 --> 01:15:28.894
<v Speaker 2>on the floor.</v>

2748
01:15:29.470 --> 01:15:30.880
<v Speaker 2>This is all new like over the,</v>

2749
01:15:31.140 --> 01:15:32.270

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2752
01:15:35.051 --> 01:15:36.670
<v Speaker 2>it's just like falls all the time.</v>

2753
01:15:36.671 --> 01:15:38.950
<v Speaker 2>And I think she's starting to get blind or something.</v>

2754
01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:40.360
<v Speaker 2>They just get week two.</v>

2755

2762
01:15:50.561 --> 01:15:51.270
<v Speaker 2>She's,</v>

2763

<v Speaker 2>she has a problem shitting and you know,</v>

2764
01:15:52.970 --> 01:15:55.810
<v Speaker 2>chickpeas in the wrong spots and putting an animal down.</v>

2765
01:15:55.910 --> 01:15:57.100
<v Speaker 2>I put my dog down.</v>

2766
01:15:57.130 --> 01:15:57.311
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2767
01:15:57.311 --> 01:15:57.461
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2768
01:15:57.461 --> 01:15:58.660
<v Speaker 2>I didn't put it down.</v>

2769
01:15:59.090 --> 01:15:59.870
<v Speaker 2>You've been there.</v>

2770
01:15:59.870 --> 01:16:00.101
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2771
01:16:00.101 --> 01:16:00.391
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2772
01:16:00.391 --> 01:16:00.640
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2773
01:16:00.640 --> 01:16:01.300
<v Speaker 2>It's horrible.</v>

2774
01:16:01.300 --> 01:16:02.020
<v Speaker 2>It's weird.</v>

2775
01:16:02.020 --> 01:16:02.620
<v Speaker 2>It's hard.</v>

2776
01:16:02.620 --> 01:16:03.190
<v Speaker 2>It's hard.</v>

2777
01:16:03.190 --> 01:16:03.970
<v Speaker 2>It's hard.</v>

2778
01:16:03.970 --> 01:16:05.050
<v Speaker 2>It's weird because you know,</v>

2779
01:16:05.051 --> 01:16:06.190
<v Speaker 2>you don't do that to people.</v>

2780
01:16:06.430 --> 01:16:06.791
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2781
01:16:06.791 --> 01:16:07.624
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2782
01:16:08.320 --> 01:16:08.900
<v Speaker 2>euthanasia,</v>

2783
01:16:08.900 --> 01:16:09.310
<v Speaker 2>some peace.</v>

2784
01:16:09.310 --> 01:16:11.170
<v Speaker 2>Some people say it's more humane.</v>

2785
01:16:11.200 --> 01:16:11.381
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2786
01:16:11.381 --> 01:16:12.220
<v Speaker 2>it is more humane.</v>

2787
01:16:12.280 --> 01:16:12.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2788
01:16:12.580 --> 01:16:16.450
<v Speaker 2>It's certainly more humane if you knew that someone that you love dearly was</v>

2789
01:16:16.451 --> 01:16:20.800
<v Speaker 2>suffering in some horrible way and they would probably stay alive for months or</v>

2790
01:16:20.801 --> 01:16:23.530
<v Speaker 2>maybe even a year in this state before they,</v>

2791
01:16:23.650 --> 01:16:26.890
<v Speaker 2>their body eventually gave out mean there's no hope to bring them back.</v>

2792
01:16:27.190 --> 01:16:29.500
<v Speaker 2>The problem is there's so many people that would kill their parents.</v>

2793
01:16:29.740 --> 01:16:31.450
<v Speaker 2>There's so many people that would kill loved ones,</v>

2794
01:16:31.451 --> 01:16:35.080
<v Speaker 2>kill him if they had the choice like people have had.</v>

2795
01:16:35.770 --> 01:16:40.770
<v Speaker 2>There's been situations where a husband or a wife had been critical and critical</v>

2796
01:16:40.841 --> 01:16:43.330
<v Speaker 2>condition and the wife had been arguing to pull the plug,</v>

2797
01:16:43.331 --> 01:16:46.960
<v Speaker 2>or the husband had been arguing to pull the plug and the massive controversy,</v>

2798
01:16:46.961 --> 01:16:48.250
<v Speaker 2>the family gets involved.</v>

2799
01:16:48.250 --> 01:16:49.270
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's angry,</v>

2800
01:16:49.271 --> 01:16:49.481
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2801
01:16:49.481 --> 01:16:50.860
<v Speaker 2>so it's,</v>

2802
01:16:50.890 --> 01:16:52.180
<v Speaker 2>you can't just do that,</v>

2803
01:16:52.200 --> 01:16:52.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2804
01:16:52.590 --> 01:16:52.731
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2805
01:16:52.731 --> 01:16:52.910
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2806
01:16:52.910 --> 01:16:54.610
<v Speaker 2>it's what about the person themselves?</v>

2807
01:16:54.611 --> 01:16:55.301
<v Speaker 2>Making a call,</v>

2808
01:16:55.301 --> 01:16:56.620
<v Speaker 2>like if they're still cognizant,</v>

2809
01:16:56.800 --> 01:16:58.330
<v Speaker 2>how can you tell they're cognizant.</v>

2810
01:16:58.331 --> 01:16:59.230
<v Speaker 2>They want to kill themselves.</v>

2811
01:16:59.231 --> 01:17:01.600
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's like suicides illegal,</v>

2812
01:17:01.630 --> 01:17:02.440
<v Speaker 2>which is hilarious.</v>

2813
01:17:02.440 --> 01:17:03.250
<v Speaker 2>Not Everywhere.</v>

2814
01:17:03.250 --> 01:17:04.083
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2815
01:17:04.160 --> 01:17:05.260
<v Speaker 2>the other countries you mean?</v>

2816
01:17:05.290 --> 01:17:05.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2817
01:17:05.600 --> 01:17:06.433
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2818
01:17:06.450 --> 01:17:06.820
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2819
01:17:06.820 --> 01:17:07.690
<v Speaker 2>but in America,</v>

2820
01:17:07.691 --> 01:17:09.250
<v Speaker 2>essentially it's illegal everywhere.</v>

2821
01:17:09.290 --> 01:17:09.531
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2822
01:17:09.531 --> 01:17:09.801
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2823
01:17:09.801 --> 01:17:11.600
<v Speaker 2>euthanasia as illegal.</v>

2824
01:17:11.700 --> 01:17:14.870
<v Speaker 2>The Kevorkian guy who will see I person,</v>

2825
01:17:14.871 --> 01:17:15.920
<v Speaker 2>I don't have a problem with it.</v>

2826
01:17:15.980 --> 01:17:16.813
<v Speaker 2>If a person,</v>

2827
01:17:17.180 --> 01:17:20.730
<v Speaker 2>if a person could pass a psychological evaluation that they're cognizant,</v>

2828
01:17:20.731 --> 01:17:23.540
<v Speaker 2>we their basic psychological evaluation and they say,</v>

2829
01:17:23.541 --> 01:17:23.811
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

2830
01:17:23.811 --> 01:17:25.220
<v Speaker 2>I'm sick of suffering or whatever,</v>

2831
01:17:25.760 --> 01:17:26.990
<v Speaker 2>but there needs to be suicide house.</v>

2832
01:17:26.991 --> 01:17:27.351
<v Speaker 2>So it was like,</v>

2833
01:17:27.351 --> 01:17:27.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2834
01:17:27.680 --> 01:17:32.680
<v Speaker 2>they can go in and just like a big hole in the ground falling or something like,</v>

2835
01:17:33.530 --> 01:17:35.010
<v Speaker 2>like there should be a witness there should.</v>

2836
01:17:35.020 --> 01:17:35.210
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2837
01:17:35.210 --> 01:17:37.220
<v Speaker 2>how about that suicide forest in Japan?</v>

2838
01:17:37.340 --> 01:17:38.173
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2839
01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:38.601
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2840
01:17:38.601 --> 01:17:39.434
<v Speaker 2>That's weird.</v>

2841
01:17:40.040 --> 01:17:43.130
<v Speaker 2>The way people choose to do it through the choose to do it with as little pain</v>

2842
01:17:43.131 --> 01:17:43.641
<v Speaker 2>as possible.</v>

2843
01:17:43.641 --> 01:17:45.680
<v Speaker 2>Very few people jump into volcanoes.</v>

2844
01:17:46.100 --> 01:17:46.461
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

2845
01:17:46.461 --> 01:17:47.780
<v Speaker 2>How many of you have bad ass way to go?</v>

2846
01:17:47.781 --> 01:17:48.614
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2847
01:17:48.770 --> 01:17:50.850
<v Speaker 2>How long would that take me?</v>

2848
01:17:50.860 --> 01:17:51.530
<v Speaker 2>Be Instant.</v>

2851
01:17:52.730 --> 01:17:53.180
<v Speaker 2>Instant.</v>

2852
01:17:53.180 --> 01:17:53.750
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>

2853
01:17:53.750 --> 01:17:53.991
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2854
01:17:53.991 --> 01:17:55.740
<v Speaker 2>You pay basically they would just burst in the flying.</v>

2855
01:17:55.750 --> 01:17:56.583
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2856
01:17:57.500 --> 01:17:58.520
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's what they used to do.</v>

2857
01:17:58.521 --> 01:17:59.030
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2858
01:17:59.030 --> 01:17:59.661
<v Speaker 2>To bad people.</v>

2859
01:17:59.661 --> 01:18:00.830
<v Speaker 2>And you'd throw them in the volcanoes,</v>

2860
01:18:01.730 --> 01:18:02.563
<v Speaker 2>didn't they do that?</v>

2861
01:18:02.810 --> 01:18:04.530
<v Speaker 2>And I don't know why day,</v>

2862
01:18:04.570 --> 01:18:05.150
<v Speaker 2>never heard about,</v>

2863
01:18:05.150 --> 01:18:06.020
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure it's happening.</v>

2864
01:18:06.021 --> 01:18:06.854

2867
01:18:11.270 --> 01:18:12.140
<v Speaker 2>We'll sacrifice.</v>

2868
01:18:12.230 --> 01:18:13.340
<v Speaker 2>Certainly a real thing.</v>

2869
01:18:13.341 --> 01:18:18.341
<v Speaker 2>So you to assume sacrifice bubble Kanal would be like the most about cool way to</v>

2870
01:18:18.591 --> 01:18:19.280
<v Speaker 2>do it.</v>

2871
01:18:19.280 --> 01:18:19.790
<v Speaker 2>Definitely.</v>

2872
01:18:19.790 --> 01:18:20.623
<v Speaker 2>And Gentlemen,</v>

2876
01:18:29.660 --> 01:18:31.730
<v Speaker 2>you're intentionally keeping the guy alive.</v>

2877
01:18:31.910 --> 01:18:32.121
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2878
01:18:32.121 --> 01:18:33.560
<v Speaker 2>But that's killing someone.</v>

2879
01:18:33.590 --> 01:18:35.090
<v Speaker 2>That's not like human sacrifice.</v>

2880
01:18:35.120 --> 01:18:35.830
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2881

01:18:36.650 --> 01:18:38.630
<v Speaker 2>oh I guess you're saying is it is a form of punishment,</v>

2883

2885
01:18:42.351 --> 01:18:43.310
<v Speaker 2>They don't like anyway.</v>

2886
01:18:44.060 --> 01:18:47.900
<v Speaker 2>But by whose standards are they an asshole that's a problem king or whoever.</v>

2888
01:18:49.160 --> 01:18:49.461
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2889
01:18:49.461 --> 01:18:50.061
<v Speaker 2>But the king,</v>

01:18:50.061 --> 01:18:51.890
<v Speaker 2>by the time the guy gets to be a king,</v>

2891
01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:55.040
<v Speaker 2>who knows whether he's a good guy or not his judgment.</v>

2892
01:18:55.160 --> 01:18:55.450

2909
01:19:22.940 --> 01:19:23.773
<v Speaker 2>Oh God,</v>

2912
01:19:27.441 --> 01:19:29.510
<v Speaker 2>They were having an online correspondence.</v>

2913
01:19:29.511 --> 01:19:30.344
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2914
01:19:30.380 --> 01:19:30.951

2917
01:19:32.780 --> 01:19:33.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2918
01:19:33.170 --> 01:19:34.940
<v Speaker 2>What was sleepless in Seattle was one where she had,</v>

2919
01:19:35.030 --> 01:19:37.160
<v Speaker 2>she squirted in the Deli or something.</v>

2920
01:19:38.060 --> 01:19:40.130
<v Speaker 2>I remember she had to orgasm in the restaurant.</v>

2921
01:19:40.390 --> 01:19:40.631
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2922
01:19:40.631 --> 01:19:41.464
<v Speaker 2>it's famous for that.</v>

2923
01:19:41.720 --> 01:19:43.520
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't that also like,</v>

2924
01:19:43.580 --> 01:19:43.701
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2925
01:19:43.701 --> 01:19:45.740
<v Speaker 2>that was like they sent each other actual letters.</v>

2926
01:19:45.770 --> 01:19:46.603
<v Speaker 2>Is that what it was?</v>

2927
01:19:47.390 --> 01:19:48.223
<v Speaker 2>It was Billy crystal.</v>

2928
01:19:48.230 --> 01:19:48.460
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

2929
01:19:48.460 --> 01:19:48.830
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2930
01:19:48.830 --> 01:19:49.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2931
01:19:49.610 --> 01:19:51.320
<v Speaker 2>So you've gotten mail was the first,</v>

2932
01:19:52.010 --> 01:19:53.420
<v Speaker 2>what year was you've got mail?</v>

2933
01:19:53.600 --> 01:19:56.630
<v Speaker 2>I would say 95 six okay.</v>

2934
01:19:56.631 --> 01:20:01.631
<v Speaker 2>Let's say that out in Seattle 95 but you see you've got mail that was an AOL</v>

2935
01:20:02.691 --> 01:20:03.501
<v Speaker 2>thing that it said.</v>

2936
01:20:03.501 --> 01:20:04.500
<v Speaker 2>Do you got mail?</v>

2937
01:20:05.210 --> 01:20:08.700
<v Speaker 2>Sleepless in Seattle was 1993 yeah.</v>

2938
01:20:08.730 --> 01:20:09.061
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2939
01:20:09.061 --> 01:20:11.760
<v Speaker 2>This is a radio talk show that they called in.</v>

2940
01:20:11.970 --> 01:20:12.960
<v Speaker 2>That's what it was.</v>

2941
01:20:12.990 --> 01:20:15.480
<v Speaker 2>You've got mail in 1998 interesting.</v>

2942
01:20:15.870 --> 01:20:18.420
<v Speaker 2>So 93 sleepless in Seattle was radio.</v>

2943
01:20:18.421 --> 01:20:19.500
<v Speaker 2>So that was before.</v>

2944
01:20:19.590 --> 01:20:19.771
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2945
01:20:19.771 --> 01:20:24.771
<v Speaker 2>that was [inaudible] 98 was essentially you've got mail was like right when,</v>

2946
01:20:25.170 --> 01:20:28.980
<v Speaker 2>four years into the Internet invasion in our culture.</v>

2947
01:20:29.040 --> 01:20:32.470
<v Speaker 2>That was probably all a number 5.0 really confusing.</v>

2948
01:20:32.471 --> 01:20:32.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2949
01:20:32.560 --> 01:20:33.310
<v Speaker 5>Time.</v>

2950
01:20:33.310 --> 01:20:35.800
<v Speaker 5>I've still know people like old people who they,</v>

2951
01:20:36.040 --> 01:20:39.970
<v Speaker 5>their perception of who AOL is and what they do is all confused.</v>

2952
01:20:40.270 --> 01:20:41.310
<v Speaker 5>Like cause people will,</v>

2953
01:20:41.311 --> 01:20:41.831
<v Speaker 5>you know what I mean?</v>

2954
01:20:41.831 --> 01:20:44.380
<v Speaker 5>Like I don't want to call anybody out,</v>

2955
01:20:44.381 --> 01:20:48.160
<v Speaker 5>but you know like AOL was a service provider.</v>

2956
01:20:48.310 --> 01:20:50.740
<v Speaker 5>They had a browser right at one time.</v>

2957
01:20:50.741 --> 01:20:53.650
<v Speaker 5>Like you would get a disc that comes along with your service.</v>

2958
01:20:53.651 --> 01:20:57.940
<v Speaker 5>You sign up and you get a CD that you have to put in and install their software.</v>

2959
01:20:57.941 --> 01:20:58.774
<v Speaker 5>Do you remember that?</v>

2960
01:20:59.520 --> 01:21:00.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2961
01:21:00.330 --> 01:21:00.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2962
01:21:00.880 --> 01:21:01.910
<v Speaker 2>so so then the,</v>

2963
01:21:01.911 --> 01:21:03.870
<v Speaker 2>and then they essentially became a media company,</v>

2964
01:21:03.871 --> 01:21:04.800
<v Speaker 2>which is what they are now.</v>

2965
01:21:04.801 --> 01:21:05.130
<v Speaker 2>They have,</v>

2966
01:21:05.130 --> 01:21:06.240
<v Speaker 2>they own some tech sites.</v>

2967
01:21:06.241 --> 01:21:08.670
<v Speaker 2>It's the reason I'm familiar and they have of course their own website,</v>

2968
01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:12.930
<v Speaker 2>but does anybody still use AOL as a that's what I was wondering.</v>

2969
01:21:13.230 --> 01:21:14.063
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2970
01:21:14.390 --> 01:21:14.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2971
01:21:14.760 --> 01:21:17.820
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of people still actually use a gold weight.</v>

2972
01:21:17.880 --> 01:21:20.220
<v Speaker 2>He sent me a fucking AOL email address.</v>

2973
01:21:20.221 --> 01:21:20.940
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>

2974
01:21:20.940 --> 01:21:21.331
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2975
01:21:21.331 --> 01:21:22.164
<v Speaker 2>no way.</v>

2976
01:21:22.410 --> 01:21:23.243
<v Speaker 2>There's still out there.</v>

2977
01:21:23.320 --> 01:21:23.611
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

2978
01:21:23.611 --> 01:21:24.444
<v Speaker 2>I'm old school.</v>

2979
01:21:24.750 --> 01:21:25.590
<v Speaker 2>Dave is awesome.</v>

2980
01:21:25.670 --> 01:21:28.230
<v Speaker 2>The member direct directory search got me leg.</v>

2981
01:21:28.260 --> 01:21:31.770
<v Speaker 2>You used to be able to just type in your address and it would find anybody who</v>

2982
01:21:31.771 --> 01:21:36.150
<v Speaker 2>had AOL around you based on your your miles and I found out like girls that</v>

2983
01:21:36.151 --> 01:21:38.670
<v Speaker 2>lived down the street from me and then I just started hooking up with them.</v>

2984
01:21:39.480 --> 01:21:40.990
<v Speaker 2>They can probably fucking sued them.</v>

2985
01:21:40.991 --> 01:21:45.350
<v Speaker 2>So Burst Stalker Internet privacy back then does not.</v>

2986
01:21:45.900 --> 01:21:46.920
<v Speaker 2>No one knew what the fuck.</v>

2987
01:21:46.921 --> 01:21:49.290
<v Speaker 2>You can just send them a message and I used to like,</v>

2988
01:21:49.291 --> 01:21:49.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2989
01:21:49.710 --> 01:21:51.180
<v Speaker 2>anyone could get a message to anyway,</v>

2990
01:21:51.181 --> 01:21:54.030
<v Speaker 2>so like if your mom was on AOL and she had an account,</v>

2991
01:21:54.060 --> 01:21:54.751
<v Speaker 2>like somebody,</v>

2992
01:21:54.751 --> 01:21:55.710
<v Speaker 2>a stranger could just be like,</v>

2993
01:21:55.711 --> 01:21:56.341
<v Speaker 2>Hey lady,</v>

2994

2997
01:22:03.391 --> 01:22:04.770
<v Speaker 2>option to use your actual name.</v>

01:22:57.631 --> 01:22:59.910
<v Speaker 2>everyone's got these whacking King Phoenix.</v>

3029
01:22:59.911 --> 01:23:00.990
<v Speaker 2>He's not your name on the fucker.</v>

3030
01:23:01.320 --> 01:23:02.940
<v Speaker 2>People used to get with email too.</v>

3031
01:23:02.941 --> 01:23:03.660
<v Speaker 2>So how many,</v>

3032
01:23:03.660 --> 01:23:05.860
<v Speaker 2>how many do you think I got the number here?</v>

3033
01:23:05.920 --> 01:23:06.230
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3034
01:23:06.230 --> 01:23:09.730
<v Speaker 5>still use AOL per year as a service,</v>

3035
01:23:09.780 --> 01:23:11.940
<v Speaker 5>as a service that they pay for a service.</v>

3036
01:23:12.540 --> 01:23:14.740
<v Speaker 5>I will say,</v>

3037
01:23:14.800 --> 01:23:15.970
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to say 4 million.</v>

3038
01:23:16.330 --> 01:23:17.163
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

3039
01:23:17.380 --> 01:23:20.390
<v Speaker 5>What would you think this is obviously us numbers only.</v>

3040
01:23:20.430 --> 01:23:20.870
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3041
01:23:20.870 --> 01:23:21.703
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

3042
01:23:21.730 --> 01:23:23.920
<v Speaker 5>How many people are currently subscribers to the Internet?</v>

3043
01:23:23.921 --> 01:23:24.770
<v Speaker 5>Through AOL?</v>

3044
01:23:27.380 --> 01:23:28.480
<v Speaker 5>You said 4 million.</v>

3045
01:23:28.580 --> 01:23:29.413
<v Speaker 5>Four.</v>

3046
01:23:29.800 --> 01:23:32.530
<v Speaker 5>And to think there's probably nothing really just subscribed to any more.</v>

3047
01:23:32.531 --> 01:23:33.001
<v Speaker 5>It's just a,</v>

3048
01:23:33.001 --> 01:23:34.030
<v Speaker 5>well still charging them.</v>

3049
01:23:34.420 --> 01:23:37.160
<v Speaker 5>I gotta think I gotta feel like it's less than that.</v>

3050
01:23:37.170 --> 01:23:37.850
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

3051
01:23:37.850 --> 01:23:39.360
<v Speaker 2>I got to feel like I'm underestimating.</v>

3052
01:23:39.361 --> 01:23:41.970
<v Speaker 2>I feel like if I had 10 okay,</v>

3053
01:23:41.971 --> 01:23:42.870
<v Speaker 2>go do you want 10?</v>

3054
01:23:42.990 --> 01:23:43.320
<v Speaker 2>I'll say,</v>

3055
01:23:43.320 --> 01:23:45.640
<v Speaker 2>I'll take 10 take 10 it's 2.5 million.</v>

3056
01:23:45.840 --> 01:23:46.770
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty close.</v>

3057
01:23:47.010 --> 01:23:47.843
<v Speaker 2>I got greedy.</v>

3058
01:23:51.690 --> 01:23:54.680
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing that it's 2 million.</v>

3059
01:23:54.681 --> 01:23:55.740
<v Speaker 2>So it's still a lot of people.</v>

3060
01:23:55.860 --> 01:23:56.970
<v Speaker 2>What was it in its Hay Day?</v>

3061
01:23:57.680 --> 01:23:58.510
<v Speaker 2>It's a good question.</v>

3062
01:23:58.510 --> 01:23:58.920
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

3063
01:23:58.920 --> 01:23:59.753
<v Speaker 2>I remember,</v>

3064
01:24:00.090 --> 01:24:00.601
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute,</v>

3065
01:24:00.601 --> 01:24:01.381
<v Speaker 2>what was that merger?</v>

3066
01:24:01.381 --> 01:24:02.790
<v Speaker 2>It was time and AOL time.</v>

3067
01:24:02.791 --> 01:24:03.690
<v Speaker 2>Media and AOL,</v>

3068
01:24:03.720 --> 01:24:04.350
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3069
01:24:04.350 --> 01:24:04.591
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3070
01:24:04.591 --> 01:24:08.730
<v Speaker 2>It was like the epitome of the DOTCOM fallout.</v>

3071
01:24:08.820 --> 01:24:10.490
<v Speaker 2>Like that acquisition where they value,</v>

3072
01:24:10.530 --> 01:24:12.960
<v Speaker 2>they valued AOL at some enormous figure.</v>

3073
01:24:13.020 --> 01:24:14.190
<v Speaker 2>I think I'm right about that.</v>

3074
01:24:15.150 --> 01:24:16.500
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about a lot of things today.</v>

3075
01:24:16.501 --> 01:24:17.334
<v Speaker 2>Worms.</v>

3076
01:24:18.270 --> 01:24:19.380
<v Speaker 2>Welcome to the puck.</v>

3077
01:24:19.920 --> 01:24:21.120
<v Speaker 2>Well now it's just,</v>

3078
01:24:21.121 --> 01:24:21.541
<v Speaker 2>that's a hill.</v>

3079
01:24:21.541 --> 01:24:22.170
<v Speaker 2>Well yeah,</v>

3080
01:24:22.170 --> 01:24:25.350
<v Speaker 2>you could just do all the new site similar to Yahoo.</v>

3081
01:24:25.410 --> 01:24:25.741
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

3082
01:24:25.741 --> 01:24:27.270
<v Speaker 2>It looks so weird.</v>

3083
01:24:28.320 --> 01:24:28.800
<v Speaker 2>Weird.</v>

3084
01:24:28.800 --> 01:24:30.480
<v Speaker 2>It's looks so odd.</v>

3085
01:24:30.510 --> 01:24:31.343
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

3086
01:24:31.510 --> 01:24:32.810
<v Speaker 5>And see there's an exact,</v>

3087
01:24:32.811 --> 01:24:34.840
<v Speaker 5>remember how we were talking about traditional media before.</v>

3088
01:24:35.080 --> 01:24:40.080
<v Speaker 5>There is an example of a company essentially losing its foothold in an</v>

3089
01:24:40.810 --> 01:24:45.810
<v Speaker 5>incredibly short span of time where they were the way to get on the internet and</v>

3090
01:24:46.121 --> 01:24:48.760
<v Speaker 5>then a decade later there are news site.</v>

3091
01:24:48.990 --> 01:24:49.450
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3092
01:24:49.450 --> 01:24:49.901
<v Speaker 5>Whoa,</v>

3093
01:24:49.901 --> 01:24:50.440
<v Speaker 5>wait a minute.</v>

3094
01:24:50.440 --> 01:24:51.640
<v Speaker 5>And they started buying up,</v>

3095
01:24:52.030 --> 01:24:52.450
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3096
01:24:52.450 --> 01:24:53.350
<v Speaker 5>media properties,</v>

3097
01:24:53.351 --> 01:24:54.610
<v Speaker 5>websites that are successful,</v>

3098
01:24:54.611 --> 01:24:54.971
<v Speaker 5>et cetera.</v>

3099
01:24:54.971 --> 01:24:57.580
<v Speaker 5>Trying to get back into the game in some way.</v>

3100
01:24:58.030 --> 01:24:59.290
<v Speaker 5>But that's a,</v>

3101
01:24:59.291 --> 01:24:59.980
<v Speaker 5>that's another,</v>

3102
01:24:59.980 --> 01:25:01.240
<v Speaker 5>that's an example of how,</v>

3103
01:25:01.420 --> 01:25:03.820
<v Speaker 5>how the acceleration is happening now,</v>

3104
01:25:03.850 --> 01:25:07.090
<v Speaker 5>where adaptation is more necessary than ever.</v>

3105
01:25:07.091 --> 01:25:09.820
<v Speaker 5>You can never rest on what you're currently doing.</v>

3106
01:25:09.821 --> 01:25:11.850
<v Speaker 5>You always have to be moving onto the next thing because,</v>

3107
01:25:12.340 --> 01:25:12.870
<v Speaker 5>or your</v>

3108
01:25:12.870 --> 01:25:13.890
<v Speaker 2>or you turn into a well.</v>

3109
01:25:14.430 --> 01:25:14.791
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3110
01:25:14.791 --> 01:25:18.870
<v Speaker 2>And there's also going to be times where whatever you use to do just doesn't</v>

3111
01:25:18.871 --> 01:25:19.704
<v Speaker 2>exist anymore.</v>

3112
01:25:19.920 --> 01:25:20.760
<v Speaker 2>It's going to go away.</v>

3113
01:25:20.761 --> 01:25:21.780
<v Speaker 2>Like if,</v>

3114
01:25:21.930 --> 01:25:25.290
<v Speaker 2>if blockbuster tried to stay open in some way,</v>

3115
01:25:25.291 --> 01:25:26.220
<v Speaker 2>shape or form,</v>

3116
01:25:26.250 --> 01:25:27.360
<v Speaker 2>it wouldn't have made it.</v>

3117
01:25:27.390 --> 01:25:29.100
<v Speaker 2>Nobody needs that anymore.</v>

3118
01:25:29.640 --> 01:25:30.720
<v Speaker 2>So it went away.</v>

3119
01:25:30.780 --> 01:25:31.290
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

3120
01:25:31.290 --> 01:25:31.591
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3121
01:25:31.591 --> 01:25:34.740
<v Speaker 2>there's going to be a lot of those kinds of things when things turn digital,</v>

3122
01:25:34.741 --> 01:25:35.880
<v Speaker 2>like record stores are,</v>

3123
01:25:36.060 --> 01:25:36.900
<v Speaker 2>they still exist,</v>

3124
01:25:36.901 --> 01:25:39.930
<v Speaker 2>but it's because records have become kind of cool.</v>

3125
01:25:39.990 --> 01:25:40.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3126
01:25:40.170 --> 01:25:41.400
<v Speaker 2>like an actual record.</v>

3127
01:25:41.401 --> 01:25:44.490
<v Speaker 2>It'll always be there in some format,</v>

3128
01:25:44.580 --> 01:25:46.350
<v Speaker 2>but it just won't be the status quo.</v>

3129
01:25:46.440 --> 01:25:47.550
<v Speaker 2>Like comic book stores,</v>

3130
01:25:48.210 --> 01:25:52.270
<v Speaker 2>like Comic Book Stores are cool because to have a physical copy of Spiderman one</v>

3131
01:25:52.271 --> 01:25:52.980
<v Speaker 2>is pretty dope.</v>

3132
01:25:52.980 --> 01:25:53.813
<v Speaker 2>But you know what,</v>

3133
01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:58.440
<v Speaker 2>you can get that marvel has an app that you can get on your iPad.</v>

3134
01:25:58.560 --> 01:25:59.220
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3135
01:25:59.220 --> 01:26:04.220
<v Speaker 2>And you watch comic books on an Ipod on better comics met marvel.</v>

3136
01:26:04.371 --> 01:26:04.970
<v Speaker 2>I think it's more,</v>

3137
01:26:04.970 --> 01:26:05.601
<v Speaker 2>marvel has one.</v>

3138
01:26:05.601 --> 01:26:08.780
<v Speaker 2>There's also another really big one I think is called comics Ologie or something</v>

3139
01:26:08.781 --> 01:26:09.550
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

3140
01:26:09.550 --> 01:26:10.940
<v Speaker 2>They had recently purchased by Amazon.</v>

3141
01:26:10.941 --> 01:26:11.450
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

3142
01:26:11.450 --> 01:26:11.811
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>

3143
01:26:11.811 --> 01:26:16.811
<v Speaker 2>It's the best way to look at comic books because you flip frame by frame so you</v>

3144
01:26:17.121 --> 01:26:18.050
<v Speaker 2>don't have spoilers.</v>

3145
01:26:18.051 --> 01:26:18.440
<v Speaker 2>Like you know,</v>

3146
01:26:18.440 --> 01:26:19.910
<v Speaker 2>sometimes you'd be reading a comic book,</v>

3147
01:26:19.911 --> 01:26:20.660
<v Speaker 2>you see the next page.</v>

3148
01:26:20.660 --> 01:26:20.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3149
01:26:20.780 --> 01:26:23.630
<v Speaker 2>You see the explosion that's in the next page and you go,</v>

3150
01:26:23.690 --> 01:26:25.130
<v Speaker 2>Oh damn,</v>

3151
01:26:25.131 --> 01:26:25.880
<v Speaker 2>that's going to happen.</v>

3152
01:26:25.880 --> 01:26:26.750
<v Speaker 2>It's actually better.</v>

3153
01:26:26.930 --> 01:26:29.870
<v Speaker 2>What's the bids is better because you're literally going frame by frame.</v>

3154
01:26:30.110 --> 01:26:33.260
<v Speaker 2>Every frame is in a unique and rain and you put it down and pick it back up.</v>

3155
01:26:33.261 --> 01:26:38.090
<v Speaker 2>You're right where you left off dude reading comic books and also it's not like</v>

3156
01:26:38.091 --> 01:26:39.140
<v Speaker 2>a limited edition.</v>

3157
01:26:39.140 --> 01:26:39.973
<v Speaker 2>You can't get it.</v>

3158
01:26:39.980 --> 01:26:43.130
<v Speaker 2>They could reproduce every God damn Concorde that ever existed in a digital form</v>

3159
01:26:43.310 --> 01:26:45.740
<v Speaker 2>and they'd be fools not to and they could do like Netflix,</v>

3160
01:26:45.741 --> 01:26:48.500
<v Speaker 2>like subscription packages where you could just read all you can.</v>

3161
01:26:48.810 --> 01:26:49.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3162
01:26:49.200 --> 01:26:50.900
<v Speaker 2>Not Actually had to buy them as one.</v>

3163
01:26:50.901 --> 01:26:53.840
<v Speaker 2>If you're willing to pay a monthly fee or something like that to make it</v>

3164
01:26:53.900 --> 01:26:58.900
<v Speaker 2>accessible to the average fan and the real big wig sort of comic book collectors</v>

3165
01:27:00.201 --> 01:27:01.034
<v Speaker 2>that are willing to pay.</v>

3166
01:27:01.670 --> 01:27:03.350
<v Speaker 2>How much is Spiderman one co worth?</v>

3167
01:27:03.410 --> 01:27:03.950
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3168
01:27:03.950 --> 01:27:04.670
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea.</v>

3169
01:27:04.670 --> 01:27:05.950
<v Speaker 2>Probably that's an interesting answer.</v>

3170
01:27:05.960 --> 01:27:06.261
<v Speaker 2>Money,</v>

3171
01:27:06.261 --> 01:27:07.094
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3172
01:27:07.400 --> 01:27:07.851
<v Speaker 2>Spiderman,</v>

3173
01:27:07.851 --> 01:27:09.440
<v Speaker 2>one insane amounts of million bucks.</v>

3174
01:27:09.441 --> 01:27:09.950
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

3175
01:27:09.950 --> 01:27:10.970
<v Speaker 2>Something crazy like that.</v>

3176
01:27:10.971 --> 01:27:12.350
<v Speaker 2>Most people are not going to have it,</v>

3177
01:27:12.890 --> 01:27:16.880
<v Speaker 2>but you could easily get it if you're a regular kid who had an iPad.</v>

3178
01:27:17.020 --> 01:27:19.610
<v Speaker 2>Like they could just upload it digitally and it'd be great.</v>

3179
01:27:19.750 --> 01:27:19.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3180
01:27:19.970 --> 01:27:20.750
<v Speaker 2>no problem.</v>

3181
01:27:20.750 --> 01:27:21.630
<v Speaker 2>And it would make thing.</v>

3182
01:27:21.650 --> 01:27:22.700
<v Speaker 2>There's this fear though.</v>

3183
01:27:22.790 --> 01:27:24.890
<v Speaker 2>There's this fear though that it brings down,</v>

3184
01:27:24.920 --> 01:27:28.370
<v Speaker 2>it has the potential to bring down the overall economic value of the more of</v>

3185
01:27:28.371 --> 01:27:33.371
<v Speaker 2>that independent marketplace where if people aren't going out and spending $8</v>

3186
01:27:34.040 --> 01:27:34.873
<v Speaker 2>per,</v>

3187
01:27:35.390 --> 01:27:35.661
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3188
01:27:35.661 --> 01:27:36.494
<v Speaker 2>per,</v>

3189
01:27:36.650 --> 01:27:36.831
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3190
01:27:36.831 --> 01:27:38.480
<v Speaker 2>comic than overall,</v>

3191
01:27:38.481 --> 01:27:39.380
<v Speaker 2>there might be less money.</v>

3192
01:27:39.381 --> 01:27:42.410
<v Speaker 2>They're less incentive to get into it and less like this is,</v>

3193
01:27:42.411 --> 01:27:44.120
<v Speaker 2>this is the music businesses argument,</v>

3194
01:27:44.121 --> 01:27:44.450
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3195
01:27:44.450 --> 01:27:45.950
<v Speaker 2>About independent stuff.</v>

3196
01:27:46.370 --> 01:27:48.590
<v Speaker 2>So don't think that that makes any sense though,</v>

3197
01:27:48.591 --> 01:27:52.370
<v Speaker 2>because I think that you're just going to make people more excited.</v>

3198
01:27:52.610 --> 01:27:56.540
<v Speaker 2>You're dealing with 350 million people in this country alone,</v>

3199
01:27:56.670 --> 01:27:56.840
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3200
01:27:56.840 --> 01:28:00.660
<v Speaker 2>You're getting more access to the comic book and I think it's going to make them</v>

3201
01:28:00.661 --> 01:28:01.401
<v Speaker 2>more excited about it.</v>

3202
01:28:01.401 --> 01:28:04.670
<v Speaker 2>The physical copies still going to be worth a massive amount of money.</v>

3203
01:28:04.671 --> 01:28:06.320
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it undervalues it at all.</v>

3204
01:28:06.500 --> 01:28:06.741
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

3205
01:28:06.741 --> 01:28:07.490
<v Speaker 2>in fact,</v>

3206
01:28:07.490 --> 01:28:11.150
<v Speaker 2>it probably makes it more exciting to actually hold the copy of it.</v>

3207
01:28:11.210 --> 01:28:11.481
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3208
01:28:11.481 --> 01:28:12.020
<v Speaker 2>But there,</v>

3209
01:28:12.020 --> 01:28:14.990
<v Speaker 2>but there will be fewer comic book stores than there were before.</v>

3210
01:28:15.470 --> 01:28:16.460
<v Speaker 2>Will there be?</v>

3211
01:28:16.700 --> 01:28:17.121
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

3212
01:28:17.121 --> 01:28:17.660
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

3213
01:28:17.660 --> 01:28:18.930
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know how many exist.</v>

3214
01:28:18.931 --> 01:28:22.280
<v Speaker 2>Still love to have the physical thing in front of them.</v>

3215
01:28:22.640 --> 01:28:23.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3216
01:28:23.030 --> 01:28:23.631
<v Speaker 2>I do too.</v>

3217
01:28:23.631 --> 01:28:23.991
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

3218
01:28:23.991 --> 01:28:24.824
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a mix.</v>

3219
01:28:24.860 --> 01:28:25.980
<v Speaker 2>If you look at like,</v>

3220
01:28:26.060 --> 01:28:26.750
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>

3221
01:28:26.750 --> 01:28:27.340
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3222
01:28:27.340 --> 01:28:27.740
<v Speaker 2>eh,</v>

3223
01:28:27.740 --> 01:28:28.281
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

3224
01:28:28.281 --> 01:28:29.114
<v Speaker 2>movies,</v>

3225
01:28:29.150 --> 01:28:31.790
<v Speaker 2>could you sustain a big budget?</v>

3226
01:28:31.940 --> 01:28:32.900
<v Speaker 2>Michael Bay?</v>

3227
01:28:33.200 --> 01:28:35.570
<v Speaker 2>How much money does he spend on transformers?</v>

3228
01:28:37.250 --> 01:28:41.510
<v Speaker 2>If people aren't going to go to the movie theater and spend $15 in another 10 on</v>

3229
01:28:41.511 --> 01:28:42.344
<v Speaker 2>popcorn,</v>

3230
01:28:42.530 --> 01:28:45.200
<v Speaker 2>is Michael Bay able to make his movies anymore?</v>

3231
01:28:45.920 --> 01:28:46.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3232
01:28:46.730 --> 01:28:47.181
<v Speaker 2>he is.</v>

3233
01:28:47.181 --> 01:28:47.571
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3234
01:28:47.571 --> 01:28:48.381
<v Speaker 2>At the same budget.</v>

3235
01:28:48.381 --> 01:28:49.730
<v Speaker 2>You buy them online.</v>

3236
01:28:50.540 --> 01:28:50.961
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3237
01:28:50.961 --> 01:28:53.420
<v Speaker 2>But that's what I mean is the consumption medium.</v>

3238
01:28:53.421 --> 01:28:54.290
<v Speaker 2>Once you're online,</v>

3239
01:28:54.291 --> 01:28:57.350
<v Speaker 2>you're expectation is that it's not going to cost you as much as it costs you at</v>

3240
01:28:57.351 --> 01:28:58.040
<v Speaker 2>the theater.</v>

3241
01:28:58.040 --> 01:29:00.830
<v Speaker 2>It's the context of the theater that pulls that money out of your pocket.</v>

3242
01:29:01.200 --> 01:29:02.490
<v Speaker 2>The highest number</v>

3243
01:29:02.490 --> 01:29:06.690
<v Speaker 1>Spiderman one has generated is this for the grade,</v>

3244
01:29:06.890 --> 01:29:07.620
<v Speaker 1>the grade them front,</v>

3245
01:29:07.620 --> 01:29:12.620
<v Speaker 1>of course 0.5 which is a complete magazine at 1.0 which is a very poor 0.5 is</v>

3246
01:29:15.271 --> 01:29:20.271
<v Speaker 1>fetched as much as $1,600 for a complete shitty torn apart Spiderman.</v>

3247
01:29:20.590 --> 01:29:21.270
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

3248
01:29:21.270 --> 01:29:22.170
<v Speaker 1>For the highest grade.</v>

3249
01:29:22.171 --> 01:29:23.130
<v Speaker 1>For a perfect copy.</v>

3250
01:29:23.131 --> 01:29:24.450
<v Speaker 1>1.1 million.</v>

3251
01:29:24.570 --> 01:29:25.740
<v Speaker 1>I was close on that estimate.</v>

3252
01:29:25.741 --> 01:29:26.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3253
01:29:26.100 --> 01:29:26.933
<v Speaker 1>you're dead on.</v>

3254
01:29:27.330 --> 01:29:29.490
<v Speaker 1>And that's a amazing fantasy.</v>

3255
01:29:30.630 --> 01:29:31.470
<v Speaker 1>It's only the,</v>

3256
01:29:31.471 --> 01:29:31.950
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3257
01:29:31.950 --> 01:29:33.600
<v Speaker 1>that is the original Spiderman.</v>

3258
01:29:33.690 --> 01:29:38.690
<v Speaker 1>Amazing fantasy had Spiderman on the cover and it was the very first time that</v>

3259
01:29:39.151 --> 01:29:40.580
<v Speaker 1>we were introduced to Spiderman.</v>

3260
01:29:40.860 --> 01:29:43.260
<v Speaker 1>It's only the third comic book to break $1 million.</v>

3261
01:29:43.261 --> 01:29:44.730
<v Speaker 1>The other two are action comics,</v>

3262
01:29:44.731 --> 01:29:48.240
<v Speaker 1>number one and detective comics number 27.</v>

3263
01:29:48.660 --> 01:29:49.493
<v Speaker 1>Amazing.</v>

3264
01:29:49.950 --> 01:29:52.020
<v Speaker 1>But I mean books for some paper see,</v>

3265
01:29:52.021 --> 01:29:52.854
<v Speaker 1>but people,</v>

3266
01:29:52.870 --> 01:29:53.701
<v Speaker 1>but look at there,</v>

3267
01:29:53.701 --> 01:29:55.550
<v Speaker 1>it's like the shitty version of it.</v>

3268
01:29:55.551 --> 01:29:56.281
<v Speaker 1>It's all fucked up.</v>

3269
01:29:56.281 --> 01:29:59.070
<v Speaker 1>It's only when we're 1600 bucks but the best perfect,</v>

3270
01:29:59.071 --> 01:29:59.521
<v Speaker 1>crisp,</v>

3271
01:29:59.521 --> 01:30:01.230
<v Speaker 1>clean as a huge gap.</v>

3272
01:30:02.190 --> 01:30:03.600
<v Speaker 1>I think there's always going to be that.</v>

3273
01:30:03.750 --> 01:30:04.140
<v Speaker 5>Again,</v>

3274
01:30:04.140 --> 01:30:06.890
<v Speaker 5>I completely agree with you that that's always going to exist to,</v>

3275
01:30:06.891 --> 01:30:08.390
<v Speaker 5>I guess the part I'm talking about,</v>

3276
01:30:08.391 --> 01:30:12.530
<v Speaker 5>it's just more mass consumption that if the mass consumption medium was paper</v>

3277
01:30:12.531 --> 01:30:14.300
<v Speaker 5>that needed to be distributed everywhere,</v>

3278
01:30:14.510 --> 01:30:18.470
<v Speaker 5>the average cost of consumption for the average user would be higher than it is</v>

3279
01:30:18.471 --> 01:30:19.820
<v Speaker 5>in a subscription based model.</v>

3280
01:30:20.030 --> 01:30:22.190
<v Speaker 5>Like Netflix for example is $8 a month.</v>

3281
01:30:22.191 --> 01:30:24.410
<v Speaker 5>But what did you spend on rentals before Netflix exists?</v>

3282
01:30:24.410 --> 01:30:25.250
<v Speaker 1>Did a lot more,</v>

3283
01:30:25.260 --> 01:30:25.940
<v Speaker 1>lot more.</v>

3284
01:30:25.940 --> 01:30:26.241
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3285
01:30:26.241 --> 01:30:26.691
<v Speaker 1>that's true.</v>

3286
01:30:26.691 --> 01:30:27.770
<v Speaker 1>That's a good way of looking at it.</v>

3287
01:30:27.980 --> 01:30:28.731
<v Speaker 1>And also,</v>

3288
01:30:28.731 --> 01:30:29.360
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3289
01:30:29.360 --> 01:30:31.910
<v Speaker 1>the amount of comics that are released,</v>

3290
01:30:31.911 --> 01:30:34.040
<v Speaker 1>like new ones that are digitally released,</v>

3291
01:30:34.041 --> 01:30:34.310
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3292
01:30:34.310 --> 01:30:35.143
<v Speaker 1>Like right now,</v>

3293
01:30:35.210 --> 01:30:37.790
<v Speaker 1>the amount of apps just for viewing comic books is,</v>

3294
01:30:38.240 --> 01:30:39.320
<v Speaker 1>you know there's a cop ball,</v>

3295
01:30:39.321 --> 01:30:40.790
<v Speaker 1>but it's not like the same.</v>

3296
01:30:41.100 --> 01:30:44.330
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you used to be able to go to any grocery store anywhere and there</v>

3297
01:30:44.331 --> 01:30:46.050
<v Speaker 1>would be an aisle that had comic books,</v>

3298
01:30:46.310 --> 01:30:50.150
<v Speaker 1>there'd be like a thing that spun around that little rack that had comic books</v>

3299
01:30:50.151 --> 01:30:53.900
<v Speaker 1>on it that slowly is going to be digital.</v>

3300
01:30:53.901 --> 01:30:54.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3301
01:30:54.070 --> 01:30:58.690
<v Speaker 5>So it's Kinda like our Amazon conversation from earlier where streamlining the</v>

3302
01:30:58.691 --> 01:31:01.830
<v Speaker 5>delivery method inevitably cuts money from,</v>

3303
01:31:01.930 --> 01:31:03.490
<v Speaker 5>from that transaction.</v>

3304
01:31:04.480 --> 01:31:05.241
<v Speaker 1>It kind of does,</v>

3305
01:31:05.241 --> 01:31:05.750
<v Speaker 1>I guess be,</v>

3306
01:31:05.750 --> 01:31:06.630
<v Speaker 1>can't think that,</v>

3307
01:31:06.740 --> 01:31:06.910
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

3308
01:31:06.910 --> 01:31:07.050
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

3309
01:31:07.050 --> 01:31:07.320
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

3310
01:31:07.320 --> 01:31:08.610
<v Speaker 5>I'm not supporting that.</v>

3311
01:31:09.540 --> 01:31:14.540
<v Speaker 5>I'm just saying that that's the counter argument in all this stuff and probably</v>

3312
01:31:14.611 --> 01:31:18.600
<v Speaker 5>the better analogy is the Michael Bay one is this idea that the traditional</v>

3313
01:31:18.601 --> 01:31:20.070
<v Speaker 5>model as fucked up as it is,</v>

3314
01:31:20.071 --> 01:31:22.230
<v Speaker 5>and maybe the most original ideas aren't getting out.</v>

3315
01:31:22.380 --> 01:31:23.970
<v Speaker 5>It generates a fuck ton of money.</v>

3316
01:31:24.680 --> 01:31:25.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3317
01:31:25.100 --> 01:31:25.851
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting,</v>

3318
01:31:25.851 --> 01:31:29.540
<v Speaker 1>but it's an inevitable part of innovation.</v>

3319
01:31:29.600 --> 01:31:33.970
<v Speaker 1>Like the horse shoe maker of the 18 hundreds it's probably so pissed when cars</v>

3320
01:31:33.980 --> 01:31:34.570
<v Speaker 1>came along.</v>

3321
01:31:34.570 --> 01:31:34.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3322
01:31:34.790 --> 01:31:35.001
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3323
01:31:35.001 --> 01:31:36.740
<v Speaker 1>He's definitely got this fucking house with a horse.</v>

3324
01:31:36.741 --> 01:31:37.574
<v Speaker 1>Shoes.</v>

3325
01:31:37.730 --> 01:31:38.280
<v Speaker 1>My whole,</v>

3326
01:31:38.280 --> 01:31:40.090
<v Speaker 1>my kingdom is from horseshoes.</v>

3327
01:31:40.390 --> 01:31:41.540
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to see his reaction.</v>

3328
01:31:41.541 --> 01:31:42.710
<v Speaker 1>He's probably so mad.</v>

3329
01:31:43.290 --> 01:31:45.590
<v Speaker 1>You know guys probably going ape shit right now.</v>

3330
01:31:45.591 --> 01:31:46.850
<v Speaker 1>You don't need a fucking car.</v>

3331
01:31:47.210 --> 01:31:47.750
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3332
01:31:47.750 --> 01:31:48.860
<v Speaker 1>He's not that expensive.</v>

3333
01:31:49.010 --> 01:31:50.510
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden he became Jerry Seinfeld.</v>

3334
01:31:50.810 --> 01:31:51.610
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

3335
01:31:51.610 --> 01:31:52.443
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3336
01:31:53.710 --> 01:31:54.251
<v Speaker 1>why do you need,</v>

3337
01:31:54.251 --> 01:31:54.920
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

3338
01:31:54.920 --> 01:31:56.420
<v Speaker 1>he strikes me as a horse shoe kind of game.</v>

3339
01:31:56.700 --> 01:31:56.900
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3340
01:31:56.900 --> 01:31:57.740
<v Speaker 1>he's a car guy.</v>

3341
01:31:58.160 --> 01:31:59.500
<v Speaker 1>Opposite of a horse guys.</v>

3342
01:31:59.560 --> 01:31:59.740
<v Speaker 1>True.</v>

3343
01:31:59.740 --> 01:32:00.310
<v Speaker 1>Like a million</v>

3344
01:32:00.310 --> 01:32:00.760
<v Speaker 2>cars.</v>

3345
01:32:00.760 --> 01:32:00.970
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3346
01:32:00.970 --> 01:32:01.900
<v Speaker 2>But he's got old ones.</v>

3347
01:32:02.620 --> 01:32:02.951
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3348
01:32:02.951 --> 01:32:04.330
<v Speaker 2>The thing is Olin torches,</v>

3349
01:32:04.360 --> 01:32:05.290
<v Speaker 2>that's his main thing though.</v>

3350
01:32:05.320 --> 01:32:06.490
<v Speaker 2>Porsche's his main thing.</v>

3351
01:32:06.700 --> 01:32:07.600
<v Speaker 2>Porsche nine 11.</v>

3352
01:32:07.601 --> 01:32:10.930
<v Speaker 2>She's got like some ungodly number of portion.</v>

3353
01:32:11.410 --> 01:32:12.640
<v Speaker 2>Better cars overall.</v>

3354
01:32:12.641 --> 01:32:13.270
<v Speaker 2>Him Or Leno?</v>

3355
01:32:13.270 --> 01:32:14.010
<v Speaker 2>Leno.</v>

3356
01:32:14.010 --> 01:32:14.843
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

3357
01:32:16.030 --> 01:32:17.200
<v Speaker 2>Leno was a gangster.</v>

3358
01:32:17.380 --> 01:32:21.430
<v Speaker 2>He has a full time staff that takes care of his cars there in a warehouse.</v>

3359
01:32:21.720 --> 01:32:22.480
<v Speaker 2>Jeez.</v>

3360
01:32:22.480 --> 01:32:23.890
<v Speaker 2>He has her online show.</v>

3361
01:32:23.891 --> 01:32:24.131
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3362
01:32:24.131 --> 01:32:26.440
<v Speaker 2>he's got some giant slate airport.</v>

3363
01:32:26.700 --> 01:32:27.100
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

3364
01:32:27.100 --> 01:32:28.210
<v Speaker 2>He also has a,</v>

3365
01:32:28.211 --> 01:32:28.870
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3366
01:32:28.870 --> 01:32:29.411
<v Speaker 2>a show,</v>

3367
01:32:29.411 --> 01:32:33.640
<v Speaker 2>a web show that he does like all based on cars breaking down cars.</v>

3368
01:32:33.850 --> 01:32:35.440
<v Speaker 2>Seinfeld has that cars and coffee.</v>

3369
01:32:35.441 --> 01:32:36.274
<v Speaker 2>She has watched it.</v>

3370
01:32:36.340 --> 01:32:37.270
<v Speaker 2>He's pretty close.</v>

3371
01:32:37.271 --> 01:32:37.691
<v Speaker 2>It's close.</v>

3372
01:32:37.691 --> 01:32:38.290
<v Speaker 2>Second.</v>

3373
01:32:38.290 --> 01:32:39.550
<v Speaker 2>His show is more a,</v>

3374
01:32:39.560 --> 01:32:40.810
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's a little bit about the car,</v>

3375
01:32:40.811 --> 01:32:43.030
<v Speaker 2>but more about hanging out with unique individuals.</v>

3376
01:32:43.180 --> 01:32:44.013
<v Speaker 2>I don't mind that show.</v>

3377
01:32:44.110 --> 01:32:44.471
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3378
01:32:44.471 --> 01:32:45.304
<v Speaker 2>it's not bad.</v>

3379
01:32:45.340 --> 01:32:50.340
<v Speaker 2>You think about a traditional media guy from 90 the nineties I think it's a</v>

3380
01:32:50.561 --> 01:32:51.670
<v Speaker 2>decent transition.</v>

3381
01:32:51.700 --> 01:32:53.890
<v Speaker 2>It's definitely better than that marriage ref thing.</v>

3382
01:32:53.891 --> 01:32:54.970
<v Speaker 2>Whatever that was on TV.</v>

3383
01:32:55.030 --> 01:32:55.780
<v Speaker 2>That was dog shit.</v>

3384
01:32:55.780 --> 01:32:56.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3385
01:32:56.410 --> 01:32:56.801
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3386
01:32:56.801 --> 01:32:58.210
<v Speaker 2>But you can't fix marriages.</v>

3387
01:32:58.240 --> 01:32:59.920
<v Speaker 2>Who the fuck told you to fix marriages?</v>

3388
01:33:00.280 --> 01:33:01.100
<v Speaker 2>This is how you fix it.</v>

3389
01:33:01.100 --> 01:33:01.933
<v Speaker 2>You break up,</v>

3390
01:33:03.670 --> 01:33:05.200
<v Speaker 2>he break them and you tell the people that get,</v>

3391
01:33:05.201 --> 01:33:08.410
<v Speaker 2>get your shit together and meet somebody else and don't let this happen again.</v>

3392
01:33:08.450 --> 01:33:09.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3393
01:33:09.010 --> 01:33:10.840
<v Speaker 2>Don't let it get to the point where you're on TV,</v>

3394
01:33:11.020 --> 01:33:12.490
<v Speaker 2>working at your grievances,</v>

3395
01:33:12.760 --> 01:33:14.980
<v Speaker 2>sniping at each other in front of America.</v>

3396
01:33:15.060 --> 01:33:15.480
<v Speaker 2>But he,</v>

3397
01:33:15.480 --> 01:33:17.110
<v Speaker 2>his his coffee show a car,</v>

3398
01:33:17.320 --> 01:33:18.520
<v Speaker 2>comedians in cars or whatever.</v>

3399
01:33:18.550 --> 01:33:20.590
<v Speaker 2>It kind of has like a podcast vibe to it a little bit.</v>

3400
01:33:20.630 --> 01:33:21.041
<v Speaker 2>Very much.</v>

3401
01:33:21.041 --> 01:33:23.800
<v Speaker 2>So it's probably edited a little too much for my taste,</v>

3402
01:33:23.801 --> 01:33:27.580
<v Speaker 2>but otherwise I feel like you're sort of getting an uncensored version of both</v>

3403
01:33:27.581 --> 01:33:28.414
<v Speaker 2>individuals.</v>

3404
01:33:28.420 --> 01:33:29.080
<v Speaker 2>Pretty much.</v>

3405
01:33:29.080 --> 01:33:29.561
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3406
01:33:29.561 --> 01:33:33.100
<v Speaker 2>And it's also a passion project,</v>

3407
01:33:33.190 --> 01:33:36.400
<v Speaker 2>whereas he doesn't need any money exactly how he doesn't make much from it.</v>

3408
01:33:36.530 --> 01:33:38.650
<v Speaker 2>Although they're still getting those accurate ads in there.</v>

3409
01:33:38.830 --> 01:33:41.050
<v Speaker 2>They are sure they're nice and smooth too.</v>

3410
01:33:41.380 --> 01:33:42.370
<v Speaker 2>And they're good ads.</v>

3411
01:33:42.610 --> 01:33:43.150
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3412
01:33:43.150 --> 01:33:43.983
<v Speaker 2>he's good at it.</v>

3413
01:33:44.080 --> 01:33:45.240
<v Speaker 2>He's good at the show.</v>

3414
01:33:45.300 --> 01:33:46.750
<v Speaker 2>He really loves cars.</v>

3415
01:33:46.810 --> 01:33:48.750
<v Speaker 2>But that's what's why it's passion projects.</v>

3416
01:33:48.760 --> 01:33:49.360
<v Speaker 2>Like he's,</v>

3417
01:33:49.360 --> 01:33:50.081
<v Speaker 2>he really is a guy.</v>

3418
01:33:50.081 --> 01:33:55.081
<v Speaker 2>Like he was driving a 1973 Porsche nine 11 rs,</v>

3419
01:33:56.200 --> 01:33:57.640
<v Speaker 2>which is a very rare car.</v>

3420
01:33:57.641 --> 01:33:58.690
<v Speaker 2>It's worth $1 million.</v>

3421
01:33:59.230 --> 01:33:59.591
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3422
01:33:59.591 --> 01:34:01.570
<v Speaker 2>And he was driving it around with someone.</v>

3423
01:34:01.650 --> 01:34:02.140
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3424
01:34:02.140 --> 01:34:03.070
<v Speaker 2>I forget who it was.</v>

3425
01:34:03.071 --> 01:34:03.940
<v Speaker 2>It was in the car with them,</v>

3426
01:34:04.150 --> 01:34:06.940
<v Speaker 2>but I think it's the guy who hosts Seth Meyers that his name.</v>

3427
01:34:07.270 --> 01:34:07.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3428
01:34:07.690 --> 01:34:08.290
<v Speaker 2>that guy.</v>

3429
01:34:08.290 --> 01:34:09.080
<v Speaker 2>I think it was him,</v>

3430
01:34:09.080 --> 01:34:09.670
<v Speaker 2>one of those,</v>

3431
01:34:09.670 --> 01:34:10.780
<v Speaker 2>some comedian character,</v>

3432
01:34:10.840 --> 01:34:11.370
<v Speaker 2>whoever it was.</v>

3433
01:34:11.370 --> 01:34:11.800
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

3434
01:34:11.800 --> 01:34:12.371
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

3435
01:34:12.371 --> 01:34:15.190
<v Speaker 2>you could tell as he's describing the car,</v>

3436
01:34:15.300 --> 01:34:16.930
<v Speaker 2>like these are Gerry's words,</v>

3437
01:34:17.080 --> 01:34:18.640
<v Speaker 2>these are real car nut.</v>

3438
01:34:18.850 --> 01:34:19.683
<v Speaker 2>So it really,</v>

3439
01:34:19.880 --> 01:34:23.400
<v Speaker 2>there's such a difference between that and someone who is just doing that eight</v>

3440
01:34:23.401 --> 01:34:24.010
<v Speaker 2>gig.</v>

3441
01:34:24.010 --> 01:34:28.030
<v Speaker 2>Like there's plenty of those guys online that are doing the car gig because they</v>

3442
01:34:28.031 --> 01:34:31.570
<v Speaker 2>could have been a weather caster or they could have been journalism's.</v>

3443
01:34:31.580 --> 01:34:32.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3444
01:34:32.020 --> 01:34:32.950
<v Speaker 2>Not even that.</v>

3445
01:34:32.951 --> 01:34:33.161
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3446
01:34:33.161 --> 01:34:35.710
<v Speaker 2>it could have been a fucking top 40 DJ or something.</v>

3447
01:34:35.770 --> 01:34:36.010
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3448
01:34:36.010 --> 01:34:38.230
<v Speaker 2>But instead they're reviewing cars.</v>

3449
01:34:38.231 --> 01:34:41.980
<v Speaker 2>This is the automatic transition transmission,</v>

3450
01:34:42.170 --> 01:34:43.540
<v Speaker 2>Kris Krane speed.</v>

3451
01:34:43.541 --> 01:34:44.860
<v Speaker 2>Dual clutch setup.</v>

3452
01:34:44.900 --> 01:34:45.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3453
01:34:45.290 --> 01:34:47.500
<v Speaker 2>It is a difference between that and like Matt Farah,</v>

3454
01:34:47.501 --> 01:34:50.050
<v Speaker 2>who's a friend of mine who has a show called drive,</v>

3455
01:34:50.350 --> 01:34:51.011
<v Speaker 2>he's on that.</v>

3456
01:34:51.011 --> 01:34:53.530
<v Speaker 2>And pretty much if you got a script in a teleprompter,</v>

3457
01:34:53.531 --> 01:34:54.364
<v Speaker 2>you're doing it wrong.</v>

3458
01:34:54.550 --> 01:34:55.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3459
01:34:55.030 --> 01:34:58.160
<v Speaker 2>And that's the thing about like,</v>

3460
01:34:58.370 --> 01:35:00.860
<v Speaker 1>if you can pursue your interests,</v>

3461
01:35:01.090 --> 01:35:02.570
<v Speaker 1>you will never work a day in your life.</v>

3462
01:35:02.600 --> 01:35:07.010
<v Speaker 1>If you can actually find a job where you're doing what you love and lasts,</v>

3463
01:35:07.070 --> 01:35:08.210
<v Speaker 1>it becomes a burden,</v>

3464
01:35:08.211 --> 01:35:10.040
<v Speaker 1>which also you can fuck up.</v>

3465
01:35:10.440 --> 01:35:11.390
<v Speaker 1>You can fuck up.</v>

3466
01:35:11.391 --> 01:35:13.610
<v Speaker 1>And the thing that you love can become your,</v>

3467
01:35:13.611 --> 01:35:13.821
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3468
01:35:13.821 --> 01:35:15.110
<v Speaker 1>it's like marrying your mistress,</v>

3469
01:35:15.111 --> 01:35:15.280
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

3470
01:35:15.280 --> 01:35:15.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3471
01:35:15.900 --> 01:35:18.690
<v Speaker 5>At least you're still doing it your way and fucking up your way.</v>

3472
01:35:18.750 --> 01:35:19.140
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3473
01:35:19.140 --> 01:35:19.660
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3474
01:35:19.660 --> 01:35:20.131
<v Speaker 5>it's still,</v>

3475
01:35:20.131 --> 01:35:23.790
<v Speaker 5>it's so different than having somebody else tell you what's right and wrong.</v>

3476
01:35:23.820 --> 01:35:25.900
<v Speaker 5>Take spirits at yourself like,</v>

3477
01:35:25.990 --> 01:35:27.240
<v Speaker 5>like sort of like the bicycle thing.</v>

3478
01:35:27.241 --> 01:35:28.270
<v Speaker 5>Someone can tell you you can,</v>

3479
01:35:28.271 --> 01:35:28.921
<v Speaker 5>you're going to fall,</v>

3480
01:35:28.921 --> 01:35:29.450
<v Speaker 5>but it's,</v>

3481
01:35:29.450 --> 01:35:32.880
<v Speaker 5>you're never going to learn as fast as experiencing the failure and,</v>

3482
01:35:32.910 --> 01:35:33.540
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

3483
01:35:33.540 --> 01:35:34.100
<v Speaker 5>and uh,</v>

3484
01:35:34.100 --> 01:35:35.460
<v Speaker 5>iterating based on it.</v>

3485
01:35:35.490 --> 01:35:35.761
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3486
01:35:35.761 --> 01:35:39.420
<v Speaker 5>that's something that I think makes like youtube for example,</v>

3487
01:35:39.421 --> 01:35:44.421
<v Speaker 5>so great is that the content producers themselves is keeping track of so many</v>

3488
01:35:44.581 --> 01:35:46.250
<v Speaker 5>different war producers were created,</v>

3489
01:35:46.260 --> 01:35:47.190
<v Speaker 5>were conning creators,</v>

3490
01:35:47.191 --> 01:35:47.641
<v Speaker 5>writers,</v>

3491
01:35:47.641 --> 01:35:48.270
<v Speaker 5>whatever,</v>

3492
01:35:48.270 --> 01:35:48.870
<v Speaker 5>whatever,</v>

3493
01:35:48.870 --> 01:35:50.280
<v Speaker 5>wearing all these different hats.</v>

3494
01:35:50.281 --> 01:35:52.020
<v Speaker 5>So you get to essentially see,</v>

3495
01:35:52.320 --> 01:35:52.531
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3496
01:35:52.531 --> 01:35:54.180
<v Speaker 5>so many different perspectives on,</v>

3497
01:35:54.320 --> 01:35:55.170
<v Speaker 5>on the output.</v>

3498
01:35:55.171 --> 01:35:59.230
<v Speaker 5>What would eventually becomes the video and that job used to take def,</v>

3499
01:35:59.380 --> 01:36:01.590
<v Speaker 5>that's a super common question I get when people,</v>

3500
01:36:01.591 --> 01:36:03.090
<v Speaker 5>when I talk to people is you do the,</v>

3501
01:36:03.100 --> 01:36:04.590
<v Speaker 5>you mean you do all that on your own?</v>

3502
01:36:04.620 --> 01:36:05.280
<v Speaker 5>All of it.</v>

3503
01:36:05.280 --> 01:36:05.721
<v Speaker 5>Like what,</v>

3504
01:36:05.721 --> 01:36:06.420
<v Speaker 5>where's the,</v>

3505
01:36:06.420 --> 01:36:07.260
<v Speaker 5>what about the camera guy?</v>

3506
01:36:07.261 --> 01:36:08.094
<v Speaker 5>What about this game,</v>

3507
01:36:08.310 --> 01:36:08.881
<v Speaker 5>that guide,</v>

3508
01:36:08.881 --> 01:36:09.714
<v Speaker 5>et Cetera.</v>

3509
01:36:09.750 --> 01:36:10.560
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

3510
01:36:10.560 --> 01:36:11.040
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3511
01:36:11.040 --> 01:36:15.480
<v Speaker 5>but there is some level of control and creativity and imagination that can come</v>

3512
01:36:15.520 --> 01:36:17.970
<v Speaker 5>free when you know how to do everything.</v>

3513
01:36:18.630 --> 01:36:19.141
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>

3514
01:36:19.141 --> 01:36:19.890
<v Speaker 5>When there aren't,</v>

3515
01:36:19.890 --> 01:36:21.510
<v Speaker 5>you aren't seeing physical barriers everywhere.</v>

3516
01:36:21.511 --> 01:36:21.900
<v Speaker 5>You're like,</v>

3517
01:36:21.900 --> 01:36:22.800
<v Speaker 5>I know how to do that.</v>

3518
01:36:23.100 --> 01:36:23.251
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3519
01:36:23.251 --> 01:36:28.251
<v Speaker 1>you also seeing you in an undirected atmosphere.</v>

3520
01:36:28.351 --> 01:36:28.840
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

3521
01:36:28.840 --> 01:36:29.670
<v Speaker 1>Really you,</v>

3522
01:36:29.670 --> 01:36:30.840
<v Speaker 1>and you're an interesting guy.</v>

3523
01:36:30.841 --> 01:36:33.680
<v Speaker 1>You're a passionate guy about all these different things that you're reviewing.</v>

3524
01:36:33.681 --> 01:36:34.080
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

3525
01:36:34.080 --> 01:36:34.321
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

3526
01:36:34.321 --> 01:36:35.460
<v Speaker 1>it draws you in.</v>

3527
01:36:35.610 --> 01:36:36.443
<v Speaker 1>There's no,</v>

3528
01:36:36.450 --> 01:36:38.700
<v Speaker 1>there's no fakeness to it all.</v>

3529
01:36:38.880 --> 01:36:42.030
<v Speaker 5>There's no way in the very produced late in the back,</v>

3530
01:36:42.360 --> 01:36:44.040
<v Speaker 5>all of us had ideas,</v>

3531
01:36:44.041 --> 01:36:44.850
<v Speaker 5>you know what I mean?</v>

3532
01:36:44.850 --> 01:36:48.660
<v Speaker 5>Everyone was directing everyone else and themselves and the whole thing.</v>

3533
01:36:48.661 --> 01:36:52.770
<v Speaker 5>And if in a more regimented environment,</v>

3534
01:36:52.800 --> 01:36:55.440
<v Speaker 5>it just sucks the life out of everything.</v>

3535
01:36:55.441 --> 01:36:58.280
<v Speaker 5>What we were talking about that if we had a producer back there that was calling</v>

3536
01:36:58.400 --> 01:36:59.220
<v Speaker 5>the clipboard,</v>

3537
01:36:59.220 --> 01:37:01.560
<v Speaker 1>meanwhile I was just five guys laughing at steris.</v>

3538
01:37:01.561 --> 01:37:01.861
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3539
01:37:01.861 --> 01:37:02.730
<v Speaker 1>And just like,</v>

3540
01:37:02.760 --> 01:37:04.350
<v Speaker 1>and trying to make the best video too.</v>

3541
01:37:04.351 --> 01:37:07.290
<v Speaker 1>Like everybody's idea was clearly about trying to like,</v>

3542
01:37:07.291 --> 01:37:08.340
<v Speaker 1>maybe we could get this shot.</v>

3543
01:37:08.350 --> 01:37:08.960
<v Speaker 1>What about that?</v>

3544
01:37:08.960 --> 01:37:10.110
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we could do that or this.</v>

3545
01:37:10.111 --> 01:37:13.680
<v Speaker 1>And it became like we were ramping it up and escalating it to make it better.</v>

3546
01:37:13.760 --> 01:37:14.630
<v Speaker 5>And I feel like,</v>

3547
01:37:14.750 --> 01:37:19.460
<v Speaker 5>I feel like that's what exposes the traditional media model in the sense that</v>

3548
01:37:19.461 --> 01:37:21.080
<v Speaker 5>like if we're having fun,</v>

3549
01:37:21.500 --> 01:37:22.820
<v Speaker 5>it's going to come through.</v>

3550
01:37:22.970 --> 01:37:26.690
<v Speaker 5>Coming back to the social media kind of element were for these guys friends,</v>

3551
01:37:26.930 --> 01:37:29.650
<v Speaker 5>we need to get as close to the experience of having them,</v>

3552
01:37:29.790 --> 01:37:29.990
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3553
01:37:29.990 --> 01:37:33.200
<v Speaker 5>here as we can for them to get the most out of the video.</v>

3554
01:37:33.560 --> 01:37:34.393
<v Speaker 5>And every,</v>

3555
01:37:34.400 --> 01:37:39.400
<v Speaker 5>every time you put this businessperson or whoever in between that communication</v>

3556
01:37:39.501 --> 01:37:40.280
<v Speaker 5>spectrum,</v>

3557
01:37:40.280 --> 01:37:45.280
<v Speaker 5>all of a sudden there's this filter and audiences are more sophisticated than</v>

3558
01:37:45.501 --> 01:37:45.741
<v Speaker 5>ever.</v>

3559
01:37:45.741 --> 01:37:48.380
<v Speaker 5>And that's why I feel like youtube is the place.</v>

3560
01:37:48.620 --> 01:37:53.300
<v Speaker 5>It's the ultimate battleground because everybody has equal access to viewership.</v>

3561
01:37:53.630 --> 01:37:57.090
<v Speaker 5>And so you can come with your big budget and you can come with your fancy voice,</v>

3562
01:37:57.091 --> 01:37:58.030
<v Speaker 5>the one you were doing there,</v>

3563
01:37:58.170 --> 01:37:59.430
<v Speaker 5>the fancy boy,</v>

3564
01:37:59.460 --> 01:38:00.780
<v Speaker 5>you can come with your million dollars.</v>

3565
01:38:00.780 --> 01:38:01.410
<v Speaker 5>In fact,</v>

3566
01:38:01.410 --> 01:38:03.510
<v Speaker 5>bringing in million dollar ring it,</v>

3567
01:38:03.540 --> 01:38:05.160
<v Speaker 5>bring it in new organic shit.</v>

3568
01:38:05.161 --> 01:38:05.910
<v Speaker 5>We'll win.</v>

3569
01:38:05.910 --> 01:38:06.570
<v Speaker 5>In fact,</v>

3570
01:38:06.570 --> 01:38:07.111
<v Speaker 5>in fact,</v>

3571
01:38:07.111 --> 01:38:08.190
<v Speaker 5>a couple of years ago,</v>

3572
01:38:08.220 --> 01:38:09.360
<v Speaker 5>maybe a couple of years ago,</v>

3573
01:38:09.390 --> 01:38:11.850
<v Speaker 5>Google thought we need more premium content on youtube.</v>

3574
01:38:11.851 --> 01:38:13.980
<v Speaker 5>So they had the launched this premium content initiative,</v>

3575
01:38:13.981 --> 01:38:15.480
<v Speaker 5>spent an enormous amount of money,</v>

3576
01:38:15.481 --> 01:38:19.470
<v Speaker 5>like $100 million to convince traditional media people to bring their content to</v>

3577
01:38:19.471 --> 01:38:20.130
<v Speaker 5>youtube.</v>

3578
01:38:20.130 --> 01:38:22.450
<v Speaker 5>Almost everything within that initiative,</v>

3579
01:38:22.500 --> 01:38:23.820
<v Speaker 5>a initiative bombed.</v>

3580
01:38:24.410 --> 01:38:24.960
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

3581
01:38:24.960 --> 01:38:25.230
<v Speaker 5>Fuck.</v>

3582
01:38:25.230 --> 01:38:28.950
<v Speaker 5>It wasn't a passion based because it wasn't passion based and it wasn't organic</v>

3583
01:38:28.951 --> 01:38:30.120
<v Speaker 5>to the platform.</v>

3584
01:38:30.150 --> 01:38:34.920
<v Speaker 5>It was this really weird kind of Frankenstein version of it.</v>

3585
01:38:34.980 --> 01:38:35.670
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3586
01:38:35.670 --> 01:38:35.920
<v Speaker 5>and I,</v>

3587
01:38:35.920 --> 01:38:36.271
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3588
01:38:36.271 --> 01:38:36.530
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>

3589
01:38:36.530 --> 01:38:36.930
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>

3590
01:38:36.930 --> 01:38:38.280
<v Speaker 5>I'm really passionate about it.</v>

3591
01:38:38.281 --> 01:38:41.730
<v Speaker 5>I'm really passionate about people that are web native remaining that way,</v>

3592
01:38:41.940 --> 01:38:42.271
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3593
01:38:42.271 --> 01:38:43.320
<v Speaker 5>and a fat paycheck.</v>

3594
01:38:43.321 --> 01:38:44.700
<v Speaker 5>Not necessarily changing that.</v>

3595
01:38:45.500 --> 01:38:45.981
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3596
01:38:45.981 --> 01:38:47.990
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it would change that for you.</v>

3597
01:38:48.020 --> 01:38:48.291
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

3598
01:38:48.291 --> 01:38:48.591
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

3599
01:38:48.591 --> 01:38:50.240
<v Speaker 1>you really do enjoy it and love it.</v>

3600
01:38:50.241 --> 01:38:55.040
<v Speaker 1>And the only thing that would change is if it became a burden,</v>

3601
01:38:55.310 --> 01:38:55.611
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3602
01:38:55.611 --> 01:38:58.640
<v Speaker 1>if it became you are beholden to another company,</v>

3603
01:38:58.641 --> 01:38:59.840
<v Speaker 1>you are beholden to,</v>

3604
01:39:00.230 --> 01:39:02.780
<v Speaker 1>if you had Sony sponsors unblocked,</v>

3605
01:39:02.840 --> 01:39:05.690
<v Speaker 1>but Sony sponsored unbox therapy or,</v>

3606
01:39:05.810 --> 01:39:06.643
<v Speaker 5>well dude,</v>

3607
01:39:06.650 --> 01:39:07.483
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's not,</v>

3608
01:39:07.640 --> 01:39:08.630
<v Speaker 5>it's not impossible.</v>

3609
01:39:08.660 --> 01:39:09.270
<v Speaker 5>That call.</v>

3610
01:39:09.270 --> 01:39:14.270
<v Speaker 5>I mean on the web there's this advertising is the web and no one wants to talk</v>

3611
01:39:14.541 --> 01:39:15.050
<v Speaker 5>about that.</v>

3612
01:39:15.050 --> 01:39:15.231
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3613
01:39:15.231 --> 01:39:17.690
<v Speaker 5>people want to run ad block and pretend that it doesn't exist.</v>

3614
01:39:18.620 --> 01:39:20.030
<v Speaker 5>Every site you love,</v>

3615
01:39:20.240 --> 01:39:21.680
<v Speaker 5>every video you love,</v>

3616
01:39:22.020 --> 01:39:26.090
<v Speaker 5>every thing important and interesting on the web or the or a lot of it,</v>

3617
01:39:26.091 --> 01:39:29.900
<v Speaker 5>the vast majority of it is supported by the fact that brands are paying to be in</v>

3618
01:39:29.901 --> 01:39:30.734
<v Speaker 5>your face.</v>

3619
01:39:30.860 --> 01:39:33.290
<v Speaker 5>Google exists because they're an advertising company,</v>

3620
01:39:33.291 --> 01:39:34.170
<v Speaker 5>first and foremost.</v>

3621
01:39:34.171 --> 01:39:35.390
<v Speaker 5>That's how they keep the doors open.</v>

3622
01:39:35.900 --> 01:39:39.110
<v Speaker 5>But there's this really weird thing where people,</v>

3623
01:39:39.230 --> 01:39:39.770
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3624
01:39:39.770 --> 01:39:40.640
<v Speaker 5>hey haters,</v>

3625
01:39:40.641 --> 01:39:41.120
<v Speaker 5>whoever,</v>

3626
01:39:41.120 --> 01:39:43.640
<v Speaker 5>people want to come on there and pretend that it's actually something else</v>

3627
01:39:43.641 --> 01:39:44.720
<v Speaker 5>they're participating in.</v>

3628
01:39:45.200 --> 01:39:48.920
<v Speaker 5>But if it wasn't for advertising in real money finding its way to the web,</v>

3629
01:39:48.921 --> 01:39:50.420
<v Speaker 5>none of us would be here right now.</v>

3630
01:39:50.690 --> 01:39:54.710
<v Speaker 5>You need it to survive and you needed to invest back in the content.</v>

3631
01:39:54.711 --> 01:39:57.080
<v Speaker 5>I'm out here in La Right now shooting fucking arrows.</v>

3632
01:39:57.120 --> 01:39:58.190
<v Speaker 5>It's not free.</v>

3633
01:39:58.700 --> 01:40:00.680
<v Speaker 5>I get a $10,000 camera back there.</v>

3634
01:40:00.681 --> 01:40:01.341
<v Speaker 5>It's not free.</v>

3635
01:40:01.341 --> 01:40:02.660
<v Speaker 5>If you want to see cool shit,</v>

3636
01:40:02.661 --> 01:40:03.650
<v Speaker 5>it's going to cost you,</v>

3637
01:40:04.070 --> 01:40:06.620
<v Speaker 5>but at least in this environment,</v>

3638
01:40:06.621 --> 01:40:11.060
<v Speaker 5>you know it's spent on the actual thing and not spent on some woman walking</v>

3639
01:40:11.061 --> 01:40:11.930
<v Speaker 5>around with a clipboard.</v>

3640
01:40:12.210 --> 01:40:12.990
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3641
01:40:12.990 --> 01:40:13.620
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3642
01:40:13.620 --> 01:40:16.980
<v Speaker 1>I've been to certain youtube shows that are super overproduced.</v>

3643
01:40:17.040 --> 01:40:17.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3644
01:40:17.280 --> 01:40:19.850
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever seen youtube shows where they do it like a Hollywood show where</v>

3645
01:40:19.851 --> 01:40:24.450
<v Speaker 1>they have makeup artists and producers and directors?</v>

3646
01:40:24.700 --> 01:40:25.051
<v Speaker 1>There's a,</v>

3647
01:40:25.051 --> 01:40:28.410
<v Speaker 1>there's a guy that's holding the camera and there's another guy directing it and</v>

3648
01:40:28.440 --> 01:40:29.850
<v Speaker 1>someone who's overviewing the thing.</v>

3649
01:40:30.120 --> 01:40:30.931
<v Speaker 1>I've seen like six,</v>

3650
01:40:30.931 --> 01:40:32.700
<v Speaker 1>seven people and I've been on the same sets,</v>

3651
01:40:32.701 --> 01:40:33.510
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3652
01:40:33.510 --> 01:40:34.350
<v Speaker 1>And what is that?</v>

3653
01:40:34.470 --> 01:40:36.390
<v Speaker 5>That's the blockbuster effect.</v>

3654
01:40:36.870 --> 01:40:40.650
<v Speaker 5>Those are the traditional people taking the easiest path to secure their</v>

3655
01:40:40.651 --> 01:40:42.600
<v Speaker 5>position without being imaginative.</v>

3656
01:40:42.910 --> 01:40:46.390
<v Speaker 1>It's also people that think that you have to do that in order to be legit,</v>

3657
01:40:46.570 --> 01:40:47.920
<v Speaker 1>you have to have all those roles.</v>

3658
01:40:47.950 --> 01:40:48.301
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

3659
01:40:48.301 --> 01:40:48.760
<v Speaker 1>Tray.</v>

3660
01:40:48.760 --> 01:40:48.911
<v Speaker 5>If,</v>

3661
01:40:48.911 --> 01:40:49.051
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

3662
01:40:49.051 --> 01:40:51.140
<v Speaker 5>if there's not a tip.</v>

3663
01:40:51.190 --> 01:40:54.190
<v Speaker 5>Today we had probably five people</v>

3664
01:40:54.190 --> 01:40:55.060
<v Speaker 2>holding cameras,</v>

3665
01:40:55.360 --> 01:40:55.990
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

3666
01:40:55.990 --> 01:40:56.580
<v Speaker 2>Not everybody,</v>

3667
01:40:56.580 --> 01:40:58.210
<v Speaker 2>not because it was their job,</v>

3668
01:40:58.211 --> 01:41:01.330
<v Speaker 2>but because it was exciting to try and get an interesting frame themselves.</v>

3669
01:41:01.670 --> 01:41:02.170
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3670
01:41:02.170 --> 01:41:07.000
<v Speaker 2>we wasted everybody on the actual subject matter instead of having somebody</v>

3671
01:41:07.180 --> 01:41:08.680
<v Speaker 2>putting powder on our faces.</v>

3672
01:41:08.920 --> 01:41:09.910
<v Speaker 2>And there was also,</v>

3673
01:41:09.911 --> 01:41:10.671
<v Speaker 2>there wasn't the,</v>

3674
01:41:10.671 --> 01:41:10.841
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3675
01:41:10.841 --> 01:41:12.520
<v Speaker 2>the voice of reason didn't exist.</v>

3676
01:41:12.560 --> 01:41:13.130
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

3677
01:41:13.130 --> 01:41:15.200
<v Speaker 2>There was no one person that would know.</v>

3678
01:41:15.270 --> 01:41:15.761
<v Speaker 2>Let's say,</v>

3679
01:41:15.761 --> 01:41:16.071
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

3680
01:41:16.071 --> 01:41:16.181
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

3681
01:41:16.181 --> 01:41:16.870
<v Speaker 2>we can't do that.</v>

3682
01:41:16.870 --> 01:41:17.703
<v Speaker 2>That's too far.</v>

3683
01:41:17.710 --> 01:41:19.060
<v Speaker 2>I going to lose our sponsors.</v>

3684
01:41:19.120 --> 01:41:19.630
<v Speaker 2>We're going to,</v>

3685
01:41:19.630 --> 01:41:20.291
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

3686
01:41:20.291 --> 01:41:22.390
<v Speaker 2>I think once you've had the real version,</v>

3687
01:41:22.450 --> 01:41:24.040
<v Speaker 2>once you had the uncensored version,</v>

3688
01:41:24.041 --> 01:41:27.190
<v Speaker 2>once you've had you on the podcast of you've had me and my show,</v>

3689
01:41:27.280 --> 01:41:30.100
<v Speaker 2>it's really hard to ingest us in another format,</v>

3690
01:41:30.130 --> 01:41:30.700
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

3691
01:41:30.700 --> 01:41:31.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3692
01:41:31.450 --> 01:41:32.620
<v Speaker 2>Well it'd be really hard.</v>

3693
01:41:33.260 --> 01:41:35.470
<v Speaker 2>It'd be really hard to recreate that,</v>

3694
01:41:35.471 --> 01:41:39.160
<v Speaker 2>to like to recreate someone who's really interested in what they're talking</v>

3695
01:41:39.161 --> 01:41:39.310
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

3696
01:41:39.310 --> 01:41:40.143
<v Speaker 2>Really passionate about.</v>

3697
01:41:40.180 --> 01:41:40.540
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

3698
01:41:40.540 --> 01:41:41.890
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you can recreate it.</v>

3699
01:41:42.130 --> 01:41:43.690
<v Speaker 2>You either into it or you're not.</v>

3700
01:41:43.730 --> 01:41:44.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3701
01:41:44.170 --> 01:41:45.100
<v Speaker 2>You can't fake that.</v>

3702
01:41:45.280 --> 01:41:46.113
<v Speaker 2>It comes through,</v>

3703
01:41:46.480 --> 01:41:46.661
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3704
01:41:46.661 --> 01:41:48.820
<v Speaker 2>that's a big issue in mixed martial arts too.</v>

3705
01:41:48.850 --> 01:41:49.670
<v Speaker 2>And big image,</v>

3706
01:41:49.670 --> 01:41:50.503
<v Speaker 2>mixed martial arts.</v>

3707
01:41:50.580 --> 01:41:51.070
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3708
01:41:51.070 --> 01:41:51.490
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

3709
01:41:51.490 --> 01:41:56.470
<v Speaker 2>there was a bunch of those sort of sports guys that got into mixed martial arts</v>

3710
01:41:56.471 --> 01:41:57.880
<v Speaker 2>and we're doing commentary on it,</v>

3711
01:41:58.000 --> 01:41:59.930
<v Speaker 2>but really didn't know what the fuck you're talking about.</v>

3712
01:42:00.070 --> 01:42:02.500
<v Speaker 2>But they were more sports and they would say like ridiculous shit.</v>

3713
01:42:02.501 --> 01:42:05.170
<v Speaker 2>And the hardcore fans would go crazy.</v>

3714
01:42:05.320 --> 01:42:06.670
<v Speaker 2>They go after them,</v>

3715
01:42:07.060 --> 01:42:07.421
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>

3716
01:42:07.421 --> 01:42:08.980
<v Speaker 2>you're not really a fan.</v>

3717
01:42:08.981 --> 01:42:12.610
<v Speaker 2>You flip out weird faker guy who doesn't even understand what you're talking</v>

3718
01:42:12.611 --> 01:42:13.180
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

3719
01:42:13.180 --> 01:42:15.190
<v Speaker 2>And it just shone through.</v>

3720
01:42:15.370 --> 01:42:18.760
<v Speaker 2>And then there's other guys that do it that they big clearly love it.</v>

3721
01:42:18.761 --> 01:42:20.650
<v Speaker 2>And those are the ones that are usually embraced.</v>

3722
01:42:20.710 --> 01:42:21.543
<v Speaker 2>For the most part.</v>

3723
01:42:21.670 --> 01:42:26.590
<v Speaker 2>The only problem from a business perspective is when the guy,</v>

3724
01:42:26.860 --> 01:42:31.810
<v Speaker 2>if the guy you're employing knows more about the thing than you do who's really</v>

3725
01:42:31.811 --> 01:42:32.770
<v Speaker 2>in the power position,</v>

3726
01:42:32.860 --> 01:42:33.693
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3727
01:42:33.980 --> 01:42:37.990
<v Speaker 2>you see there's something really enticing about putting a puppet in.</v>

3728
01:42:38.490 --> 01:42:39.130
<v Speaker 2>It's true.</v>

3729
01:42:39.130 --> 01:42:39.521
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3730
01:42:39.521 --> 01:42:43.410
<v Speaker 2>And or putting an expert in who will do your bidding or putting,</v>

3731
01:42:43.810 --> 01:42:44.261
<v Speaker 2>putting it to,</v>

3732
01:42:44.261 --> 01:42:44.561
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3733
01:42:44.561 --> 01:42:45.161
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

3734
01:42:45.161 --> 01:42:47.050
<v Speaker 2>An expert the way you see it,</v>

3735
01:42:47.170 --> 01:42:49.170
<v Speaker 2>a well compensated experts and those,</v>

3736
01:42:49.200 --> 01:42:52.120
<v Speaker 2>that'd be a company man and expert actor.</v>

3737
01:42:52.450 --> 01:42:52.901
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3738
01:42:52.901 --> 01:42:54.940
<v Speaker 2>And then when it comes to electronics and things,</v>

3739
01:42:54.941 --> 01:42:58.060
<v Speaker 2>that's when it gets really squirrely because if Sony knows that you've been</v>

3740
01:42:58.061 --> 01:43:01.900
<v Speaker 2>beholding to LG and they try to lure you from the LG side and then,</v>

3741
01:43:02.190 --> 01:43:04.090
<v Speaker 2>and then LG finds out that you,</v>

3742
01:43:04.120 --> 01:43:05.560
<v Speaker 2>well you fucking went over to Sony.</v>

3743
01:43:05.561 --> 01:43:06.380
<v Speaker 2>Hi Goddamn.</v>

3744
01:43:06.380 --> 01:43:08.400
<v Speaker 2>Turncoat like you,</v>

3745
01:43:08.410 --> 01:43:10.720
<v Speaker 2>you've relationships and the whole fucking thing.</v>

3746
01:43:10.721 --> 01:43:11.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3747
01:43:11.200 --> 01:43:11.950
<v Speaker 2>How does that work?</v>

3748
01:43:11.950 --> 01:43:14.980
<v Speaker 2>Like when you get stuff like I know top gear.</v>

3749
01:43:15.130 --> 01:43:15.371
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3750
01:43:15.371 --> 01:43:17.350
<v Speaker 2>You know that show top gear from the baby seat in the show.</v>

3751
01:43:17.351 --> 01:43:18.184
<v Speaker 2>Great show,</v>

3752
01:43:18.190 --> 01:43:18.611
<v Speaker 2>great show.</v>

3753
01:43:18.611 --> 01:43:21.340
<v Speaker 2>Well they had a problem with American,</v>

3754
01:43:21.550 --> 01:43:22.180
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3755
01:43:22.180 --> 01:43:26.530
<v Speaker 2>would do it on doing it in America because they shit on some cars.</v>

3756
01:43:26.830 --> 01:43:27.580
<v Speaker 2>I mean they,</v>

3757
01:43:27.580 --> 01:43:30.630
<v Speaker 2>Jeremy Clarkson takes open dumps on some cars.</v>

3758
01:43:30.631 --> 01:43:35.170
<v Speaker 2>Emily Porsha's like for years and years until like the nine,</v>

3759
01:43:35.171 --> 01:43:35.561
<v Speaker 2>nine,</v>

3760
01:43:35.561 --> 01:43:38.140
<v Speaker 2>seven turbo was the first Porsche he praised.</v>

3761
01:43:38.500 --> 01:43:39.730
<v Speaker 2>He would shit on them.</v>

3762
01:43:39.731 --> 01:43:41.170
<v Speaker 2>How stupid they were.</v>

3763
01:43:41.171 --> 01:43:44.080
<v Speaker 2>And they were basically overgrown Beatles and like,</v>

3764
01:43:44.380 --> 01:43:44.711
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3765
01:43:44.711 --> 01:43:45.850
<v Speaker 2>it would constantly do that.</v>

3766
01:43:45.851 --> 01:43:46.960
<v Speaker 2>And because of that,</v>

3767
01:43:46.961 --> 01:43:50.260
<v Speaker 2>like a lot of American car companies didn't want to donate their cars to them</v>

3768
01:43:50.380 --> 01:43:52.070
<v Speaker 2>and they had a real issue doing</v>

3769
01:43:52.130 --> 01:43:53.930
<v Speaker 1>that show on American TV.</v>

3770
01:43:54.160 --> 01:43:57.820
<v Speaker 5>We kind of dipped into that in the last conversation about how when your subject</v>

3771
01:43:57.821 --> 01:43:59.890
<v Speaker 5>matter comes from a company,</v>

3772
01:44:00.280 --> 01:44:01.280
<v Speaker 5>like if you,</v>

3773
01:44:01.400 --> 01:44:01.721
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3774
01:44:01.721 --> 01:44:04.150
<v Speaker 5>when you want to go shoot a Romcom movie,</v>

3775
01:44:04.240 --> 01:44:07.090
<v Speaker 5>the subject matters that are the actors that you hire.</v>

3776
01:44:07.540 --> 01:44:08.560
<v Speaker 5>But in this case,</v>

3777
01:44:08.740 --> 01:44:09.071
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>

3778
01:44:09.071 --> 01:44:10.030
<v Speaker 5>these are actors,</v>

3779
01:44:10.031 --> 01:44:10.600
<v Speaker 5>these are the,</v>

3780
01:44:10.600 --> 01:44:12.790
<v Speaker 5>this is what makes the video or breaks the video.</v>

3781
01:44:13.090 --> 01:44:13.301
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3782
01:44:13.301 --> 01:44:15.700
<v Speaker 5>I can sit there and talk about what I've heard all I want,</v>

3783
01:44:15.701 --> 01:44:17.140
<v Speaker 5>but without it in my hands,</v>

3784
01:44:17.380 --> 01:44:20.230
<v Speaker 5>I have no interpretation to share with you.</v>

3785
01:44:20.890 --> 01:44:25.660
<v Speaker 5>So it's a very big deal maintaining these relationships and making sure that</v>

3786
01:44:25.661 --> 01:44:29.680
<v Speaker 5>you're going to get your hands on this stuff and therefore it is important what</v>

3787
01:44:29.681 --> 01:44:31.120
<v Speaker 5>people say and how they say it.</v>

3788
01:44:31.750 --> 01:44:32.890
<v Speaker 5>And so this is,</v>

3789
01:44:32.950 --> 01:44:37.930
<v Speaker 5>I was ranting last show on tech journalism and somebody had a really good point</v>

3790
01:44:37.931 --> 01:44:40.180
<v Speaker 5>in the youtube comments about journalism in general.</v>

3791
01:44:40.240 --> 01:44:40.541
<v Speaker 5>They're like,</v>

3792
01:44:40.541 --> 01:44:41.080
<v Speaker 5>wait a minute,</v>

3793
01:44:41.080 --> 01:44:42.040
<v Speaker 5>think about politics.</v>

3794
01:44:42.041 --> 01:44:43.650
<v Speaker 5>Think about commercials on CNN.</v>

3795
01:44:43.651 --> 01:44:47.650
<v Speaker 5>I think about the agenda of anybody trying to get a message out there.</v>

3796
01:44:47.651 --> 01:44:51.430
<v Speaker 5>If you can shrouded under the heading of journalism,</v>

3797
01:44:51.730 --> 01:44:54.910
<v Speaker 5>it's going to get past the filtration system that much easier.</v>

3798
01:44:55.210 --> 01:44:55.481
<v Speaker 5>See,</v>

3799
01:44:55.481 --> 01:44:57.190
<v Speaker 5>it's the best advertising,</v>

3800
01:44:57.220 --> 01:44:58.690
<v Speaker 5>real advertising stuff.</v>

3801
01:44:58.691 --> 01:44:59.770
<v Speaker 5>You don't even know it's there.</v>

3802
01:45:02.050 --> 01:45:04.110
<v Speaker 1>I like we just said product placement.</v>

3803
01:45:04.140 --> 01:45:06.270
<v Speaker 1>I remember when I first found out about product placement,</v>

3804
01:45:06.570 --> 01:45:08.220
<v Speaker 1>I think it was on news radio,</v>

3805
01:45:08.490 --> 01:45:08.941
<v Speaker 1>they would,</v>

3806
01:45:08.941 --> 01:45:09.121
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3807
01:45:09.121 --> 01:45:09.601
<v Speaker 1>there's two,</v>

3808
01:45:09.601 --> 01:45:13.200
<v Speaker 1>there's different types of product placement and one there's free product that</v>

3809
01:45:13.201 --> 01:45:15.120
<v Speaker 1>they just give you free product and so you,</v>

3810
01:45:15.150 --> 01:45:18.330
<v Speaker 1>you drink their sodas on the set and you wear their clothes.</v>

3811
01:45:18.331 --> 01:45:21.330
<v Speaker 1>Like Nike will give you free sneakers if you're on a television show,</v>

3812
01:45:21.570 --> 01:45:22.700
<v Speaker 1>like things along those lines.</v>

3813
01:45:22.770 --> 01:45:23.910
<v Speaker 1>There's that kind.</v>

3814
01:45:24.180 --> 01:45:29.160
<v Speaker 1>And then there's also like where you are supposed to be holding up a cocacola</v>

3815
01:45:29.400 --> 01:45:30.550
<v Speaker 1>while you're in the like,</v>

3816
01:45:30.930 --> 01:45:31.261
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

3817
01:45:31.261 --> 01:45:33.750
<v Speaker 1>we've got to find this fucking killer before he kills again.</v>

3818
01:45:36.530 --> 01:45:38.610
<v Speaker 1>It's refreshing.</v>

3819
01:45:38.640 --> 01:45:39.710
<v Speaker 1>It's really helped me fight crime.</v>

3820
01:45:40.030 --> 01:45:40.320
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3821
01:45:40.320 --> 01:45:41.290
<v Speaker 5>that's like the low,</v>

3822
01:45:41.291 --> 01:45:42.730
<v Speaker 5>the low five version.</v>

3823
01:45:42.850 --> 01:45:43.151
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>

3824
01:45:43.151 --> 01:45:45.210
<v Speaker 5>that's like the unsophisticated version of it.</v>

3825
01:45:45.460 --> 01:45:50.170
<v Speaker 1>But then on sophisticated version rears its ugly head pretty often.</v>

3826
01:45:50.171 --> 01:45:51.220
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes offensively.</v>

3827
01:45:51.280 --> 01:45:51.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3828
01:45:51.550 --> 01:45:52.810
<v Speaker 1>on cable TV and the Internet.</v>

3829
01:45:52.840 --> 01:45:53.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3830
01:45:53.080 --> 01:45:54.500
<v Speaker 1>The end of that we'll react to internet.</v>

3831
01:45:54.530 --> 01:45:56.910
<v Speaker 1>One problem with that shit product place when you fuckhead</v>

3832
01:45:57.090 --> 01:45:58.120
<v Speaker 5>Internet won't put up with Shit and,</v>

3833
01:45:58.130 --> 01:46:01.670
<v Speaker 5>and ultimately I don't think it functions in nearly as well.</v>

3834
01:46:02.030 --> 01:46:02.863
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

3835
01:46:03.140 --> 01:46:03.973
<v Speaker 5>here's the thing,</v>

3836
01:46:04.430 --> 01:46:06.770
<v Speaker 5>I always get pissed off when I'm watching a movie or something and they've</v>

3837
01:46:06.771 --> 01:46:10.970
<v Speaker 5>completely covered up the logos on everything because watching that movie for me</v>

3838
01:46:10.971 --> 01:46:12.800
<v Speaker 5>is all about the suspension of disbelief.</v>

3839
01:46:13.250 --> 01:46:16.310
<v Speaker 5>I have to believe that what I'm looking at is potentially</v>

3840
01:46:16.370 --> 01:46:16.970
<v Speaker 1>possible,</v>

3841
01:46:16.970 --> 01:46:21.080
<v Speaker 1>like if it's an apple laptop of the apple part is blurred out every reality show</v>

3842
01:46:21.081 --> 01:46:21.560
<v Speaker 1>ever.</v>

3843
01:46:21.560 --> 01:46:26.210
<v Speaker 1>Is that as bad as when it's a Sony show and everyone's got a Sony?</v>

3844
01:46:26.330 --> 01:46:29.510
<v Speaker 1>I was watching a movie a day where everyone had Sony,</v>

3845
01:46:30.230 --> 01:46:30.681
<v Speaker 1>Sony,</v>

3846
01:46:30.681 --> 01:46:32.090
<v Speaker 1>Vaio laptops</v>

3847
01:46:32.470 --> 01:46:32.711
<v Speaker 5>right now,</v>

3848
01:46:32.711 --> 01:46:33.610
<v Speaker 5>his music videos,</v>

3849
01:46:33.770 --> 01:46:34.280
<v Speaker 5>music videos.</v>

3850
01:46:34.280 --> 01:46:35.620
<v Speaker 5>It's no longer a viable business.</v>

3851
01:46:35.680 --> 01:46:37.560
<v Speaker 5>The investing that much money in a video,</v>

3852
01:46:37.561 --> 01:46:39.700
<v Speaker 5>then all you're going to get is a little bit of ad revenue on Youtube,</v>

3853
01:46:40.180 --> 01:46:43.330
<v Speaker 5>so they're all supported heavily by private placement.</v>

3854
01:46:43.331 --> 01:46:44.380
<v Speaker 5>You'll see beats audio,</v>

3855
01:46:44.381 --> 01:46:49.381
<v Speaker 5>you'll see special phones and like super heavy in the frame.</v>

3856
01:46:49.861 --> 01:46:50.694
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3857
01:46:50.970 --> 01:46:51.803
<v Speaker 2>for me,</v>

3858
01:46:52.290 --> 01:46:54.900
<v Speaker 2>if we can all agree that the audiences themselves is becoming more</v>

3859
01:46:54.901 --> 01:46:55.734
<v Speaker 2>sophisticated,</v>

3860
01:46:55.860 --> 01:46:59.460
<v Speaker 2>we need to get better at hiding the Easter eggs in our entertainment because</v>

3861
01:46:59.461 --> 01:47:01.410
<v Speaker 2>you're going to fuck up my suspension of disbelief.</v>

3862
01:47:01.710 --> 01:47:02.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3863
01:47:02.310 --> 01:47:03.270
<v Speaker 2>Using them.</v>

3864
01:47:03.271 --> 01:47:04.560
<v Speaker 2>So blatantly obvious.</v>

3865
01:47:04.600 --> 01:47:05.130
<v Speaker 2>Like I,</v>

3866
01:47:05.130 --> 01:47:07.650
<v Speaker 2>like I said with this movie I saw the other day,</v>

3867
01:47:07.710 --> 01:47:11.130
<v Speaker 2>the every time they took a photograph it was a Sony Camera.</v>

3868
01:47:11.160 --> 01:47:11.993
<v Speaker 2>Every time.</v>

3869
01:47:12.060 --> 01:47:13.290
<v Speaker 2>What fucking movie was it?</v>

3870
01:47:13.291 --> 01:47:14.124
<v Speaker 2>God dammit.</v>

3871
01:47:14.280 --> 01:47:14.461
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3872
01:47:14.461 --> 01:47:15.900
<v Speaker 2>you need to call this out right now.</v>

3873
01:47:15.930 --> 01:47:16.111
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3874
01:47:16.111 --> 01:47:17.850
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to remember what movie it is.</v>

3875
01:47:17.970 --> 01:47:18.960
<v Speaker 2>I just saw it.</v>

3876
01:47:19.290 --> 01:47:19.531
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3877
01:47:19.531 --> 01:47:24.390
<v Speaker 2>Well here's the problem with the blatant call out is that all of a sudden as a</v>

3878
01:47:24.391 --> 01:47:26.880
<v Speaker 2>consumer your guard is up re,</v>

3879
01:47:26.970 --> 01:47:27.271
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

3880
01:47:27.271 --> 01:47:32.130
<v Speaker 2>We are bombarded with brand messages on a daily basis and till because of it we</v>

3881
01:47:32.131 --> 01:47:34.140
<v Speaker 2>build up this force field.</v>

3882
01:47:34.500 --> 01:47:35.060
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3883
01:47:35.060 --> 01:47:35.460
<v Speaker 2>That,</v>

3884
01:47:35.460 --> 01:47:35.821
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

3885
01:47:35.821 --> 01:47:36.720
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember what the figure is.</v>

3886
01:47:36.720 --> 01:47:39.870
<v Speaker 2>You're inundated with thousands of brand messages before you even get to work in</v>

3887
01:47:39.871 --> 01:47:40.800
<v Speaker 2>the morning type thing.</v>

3888
01:47:40.900 --> 01:47:41.733
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3889
01:47:41.790 --> 01:47:45.650
<v Speaker 2>And so your guard is up and so it doesn't pass into that other portion of that</v>

3890
01:47:45.670 --> 01:47:48.510
<v Speaker 2>subconscious portion of your mind that controls your purchasing decisions.</v>

3891
01:47:48.690 --> 01:47:52.350
<v Speaker 2>So not only are you fucking up my entertainment by not allowing for the</v>

3892
01:47:52.351 --> 01:47:53.370
<v Speaker 2>suspension of disbelief,</v>

3893
01:47:53.371 --> 01:47:53.940
<v Speaker 2>but you're not also,</v>

3894
01:47:53.940 --> 01:47:56.880
<v Speaker 2>you're also not selling me your product because I saw what you did there.</v>

3895
01:47:57.060 --> 01:47:57.750
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3896
01:47:57.750 --> 01:47:58.201
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3897
01:47:58.201 --> 01:47:59.310
<v Speaker 2>And if I do buy it,</v>

3898
01:47:59.370 --> 01:48:03.570
<v Speaker 2>like I'm buying it in spite of what you did because exactly like it's so good.</v>

3899
01:48:03.571 --> 01:48:04.410
<v Speaker 2>I'll buy it anyway.</v>

3900
01:48:04.411 --> 01:48:04.951
<v Speaker 2>But God,</v>

3901
01:48:04.951 --> 01:48:05.460
<v Speaker 2>you idiots.</v>

3902
01:48:05.460 --> 01:48:05.641
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3903
01:48:05.641 --> 01:48:07.140
<v Speaker 2>deliver us from evil.</v>

3904
01:48:07.770 --> 01:48:08.700
<v Speaker 2>That's what it was.</v>

3905
01:48:08.760 --> 01:48:09.593
<v Speaker 2>What's it about?</v>

3906
01:48:09.840 --> 01:48:10.201
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3907
01:48:10.201 --> 01:48:12.210
<v Speaker 2>it's a silly fucking movie.</v>

3908
01:48:12.350 --> 01:48:13.380
<v Speaker 2>It's supposedly,</v>

3909
01:48:13.381 --> 01:48:14.970
<v Speaker 2>it's Eric Bana movie.</v>

3910
01:48:15.330 --> 01:48:16.980
<v Speaker 2>It's based on um,</v>

3911
01:48:17.030 --> 01:48:17.310
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3912
01:48:17.310 --> 01:48:22.030
<v Speaker 2>the real life instances off a New York City police to duck</v>

3913
01:48:23.760 --> 01:48:26.100
<v Speaker 2>serious thing where a guy was possessed.</v>

3914
01:48:26.100 --> 01:48:26.251
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

3915
01:48:26.251 --> 01:48:27.390
<v Speaker 2>get the fuck out of here.</v>

3916
01:48:27.391 --> 01:48:28.440
<v Speaker 2>It's so ridiculous.</v>

3917
01:48:28.441 --> 01:48:28.920
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

3918
01:48:28.920 --> 01:48:29.161
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

3919
01:48:29.161 --> 01:48:30.480
<v Speaker 2>and that had product placement.</v>

3920
01:48:30.481 --> 01:48:31.080
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting.</v>

3921
01:48:31.080 --> 01:48:33.630
<v Speaker 2>Really blatantly obvious product placement.</v>

3922
01:48:34.250 --> 01:48:35.130
<v Speaker 2>It was pretty silly.</v>

3923
01:48:35.160 --> 01:48:35.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3924
01:48:35.490 --> 01:48:36.151
<v Speaker 2>Like so much.</v>

3925
01:48:36.151 --> 01:48:40.980
<v Speaker 2>So like every time they use the phone you got to see the Sony logo clearly in</v>

3926
01:48:40.981 --> 01:48:41.491
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>

3927
01:48:41.491 --> 01:48:44.310
<v Speaker 2>And that's see brands themselves,</v>

3928
01:48:44.311 --> 01:48:48.090
<v Speaker 2>the people making those calls to the wrong fucking people did the wrong people</v>

3929
01:48:48.330 --> 01:48:50.370
<v Speaker 2>that there's just some meeting somewhere in there going,</v>

3930
01:48:50.371 --> 01:48:50.551
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

3931
01:48:50.551 --> 01:48:52.770
<v Speaker 2>we can have the phone in for three frames or eight frames.</v>

3932
01:48:54.060 --> 01:48:57.750
<v Speaker 2>We'll take eight frames because we want as much of these as we can get.</v>

3933
01:48:57.890 --> 01:48:58.051
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3934
01:48:58.051 --> 01:48:59.550
<v Speaker 2>it's not a question of quantity.</v>

3935
01:48:59.730 --> 01:49:00.360
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>

3936
01:49:00.360 --> 01:49:02.100
<v Speaker 2>you just got to plant the seed man.</v>

3937
01:49:02.370 --> 01:49:02.551
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3938
01:49:02.551 --> 01:49:05.160
<v Speaker 2>if you're teaching them how to be fuckheads,</v>

3939
01:49:05.490 --> 01:49:06.323
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you should,</v>

3940
01:49:06.500 --> 01:49:09.270
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think that's fuckhead at all because my life experience,</v>

3941
01:49:09.300 --> 01:49:10.320
<v Speaker 2>I don't care about average.</v>

3942
01:49:10.350 --> 01:49:11.183
<v Speaker 2>Like I,</v>

3943
01:49:11.250 --> 01:49:15.030
<v Speaker 2>I personally think good advertising is one of the most sophisticated art forms</v>

3944
01:49:15.031 --> 01:49:15.660
<v Speaker 2>that exists,</v>

3945
01:49:15.660 --> 01:49:16.110
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3946
01:49:16.110 --> 01:49:18.420
<v Speaker 2>I have enormous respect for good advertising.</v>

3947
01:49:18.810 --> 01:49:20.640
<v Speaker 2>The problem with advertising it,</v>

3948
01:49:20.750 --> 01:49:21.750
<v Speaker 2>it's context.</v>

3949
01:49:21.930 --> 01:49:22.860
<v Speaker 2>Like for example,</v>

3950
01:49:23.180 --> 01:49:23.520
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3951
01:49:23.520 --> 01:49:23.971
<v Speaker 2>women,</v>

3952
01:49:23.971 --> 01:49:25.020
<v Speaker 2>they are going to read vogue,</v>

3953
01:49:25.080 --> 01:49:25.831
<v Speaker 2>Vogue magazine,</v>

3954
01:49:25.831 --> 01:49:26.664
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3955
01:49:26.820 --> 01:49:30.510
<v Speaker 2>Vogue magazine is as much about the people they choose to let advertise in there</v>

3956
01:49:30.511 --> 01:49:32.610
<v Speaker 2>as it is about anything they write on their own.</v>

3957
01:49:33.030 --> 01:49:34.650
<v Speaker 2>It's all about context,</v>

3958
01:49:34.800 --> 01:49:36.570
<v Speaker 2>the experience of picking it up,</v>

3959
01:49:36.571 --> 01:49:37.590
<v Speaker 2>going through the pages,</v>

3960
01:49:37.591 --> 01:49:39.780
<v Speaker 2>finding things that are attractive and will pulling you in.</v>

3961
01:49:39.781 --> 01:49:43.230
<v Speaker 2>And knowing that for three or $4 you are now,</v>

3962
01:49:43.620 --> 01:49:44.453
<v Speaker 2>you are now,</v>

3963
01:49:44.670 --> 01:49:45.503
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3964
01:49:45.730 --> 01:49:46.080
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3965
01:49:46.080 --> 01:49:48.070
<v Speaker 2>completely consumed in</v>

3966
01:49:48.070 --> 01:49:52.690
<v Speaker 5>the culture of all this really expensive stuff in these really expensive brands</v>

3967
01:49:52.900 --> 01:49:54.100
<v Speaker 5>and it's all connected.</v>

3968
01:49:54.220 --> 01:49:55.420
<v Speaker 5>See their narrative.</v>

3969
01:49:55.510 --> 01:49:59.140
<v Speaker 5>The narrative on Vogue magazine is not about what they're putting into it.</v>

3970
01:49:59.380 --> 01:50:01.300
<v Speaker 5>It's about who else is there,</v>

3971
01:50:01.301 --> 01:50:02.320
<v Speaker 5>who's at the party,</v>

3972
01:50:02.710 --> 01:50:04.660
<v Speaker 5>Gucci's their Louis Vuitton is there,</v>

3973
01:50:04.661 --> 01:50:05.350
<v Speaker 5>et cetera.</v>

3974
01:50:05.350 --> 01:50:07.600
<v Speaker 5>It's about building that entire thing up</v>

3975
01:50:07.790 --> 01:50:09.230
<v Speaker 1>and for the male perspective,</v>

3976
01:50:09.260 --> 01:50:11.150
<v Speaker 1>dupont registry even better example,</v>

3977
01:50:11.270 --> 01:50:13.610
<v Speaker 1>perfect registry is an ad book.</v>

3978
01:50:13.640 --> 01:50:13.961
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

3979
01:50:13.961 --> 01:50:15.110
<v Speaker 1>You're buying an ad book.</v>

3980
01:50:15.140 --> 01:50:19.370
<v Speaker 1>Everything in that magazine is an advertisement and we liked everything and we</v>

3981
01:50:19.371 --> 01:50:22.340
<v Speaker 1>love it and it's there at every fucking newsstand.</v>

3982
01:50:22.520 --> 01:50:25.220
<v Speaker 1>You see a dupont registry and it's got some new car on.</v>

3983
01:50:25.221 --> 01:50:29.490
<v Speaker 1>That's costs way too much fucking money for 99.99,</v>

3984
01:50:29.510 --> 01:50:31.910
<v Speaker 1>9% of the people that ever buy that magazine to afford.</v>

3985
01:50:31.970 --> 01:50:32.270
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

3986
01:50:32.270 --> 01:50:33.140
<v Speaker 1>Probably more than that.</v>

3987
01:50:33.320 --> 01:50:38.320
<v Speaker 1>Like the Bugatti Veyron 1,000,005 and it's on the cover and you'll like what?</v>

3988
01:50:38.690 --> 01:50:43.310
<v Speaker 1>Who's his magazine for ad for a car that costs more than most people's fucking</v>

3989
01:50:43.311 --> 01:50:43.880
<v Speaker 1>houses.</v>

3990
01:50:43.880 --> 01:50:45.170
<v Speaker 1>What else is the Robb report?</v>

3991
01:50:45.260 --> 01:50:45.561
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

3992
01:50:45.561 --> 01:50:46.240
<v Speaker 1>That's another one.</v>

3993
01:50:46.240 --> 01:50:46.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3994
01:50:46.340 --> 01:50:47.900
<v Speaker 1>All the Robb report is everything though.</v>

3995
01:50:47.901 --> 01:50:49.910
<v Speaker 1>It's like boats and planes.</v>

3996
01:50:49.911 --> 01:50:53.540
<v Speaker 1>If vacation homes in Hawaii and all this crazy shit,</v>

3997
01:50:53.600 --> 01:50:54.500
<v Speaker 1>but that's the thing.</v>

3998
01:50:54.501 --> 01:50:55.260
<v Speaker 1>It's like</v>

3999
01:50:55.260 --> 01:50:58.410
<v Speaker 5>ultimately people want to be told what to get,</v>

4000
01:50:58.530 --> 01:50:58.741
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4001
01:50:58.741 --> 01:51:00.090
<v Speaker 5>we don't have the time.</v>

4002
01:51:00.360 --> 01:51:02.580
<v Speaker 5>It's the reason that channels like mine exist.</v>

4003
01:51:02.610 --> 01:51:04.300
<v Speaker 5>You don't have the,</v>

4004
01:51:04.860 --> 01:51:05.820
<v Speaker 5>there are so many,</v>

4005
01:51:05.821 --> 01:51:06.471
<v Speaker 5>the products,</v>

4006
01:51:06.471 --> 01:51:10.800
<v Speaker 5>fear is so huge now that keeping tabs on all of it is very difficult to do.</v>

4007
01:51:10.801 --> 01:51:15.801
<v Speaker 5>And in some ways we're reverting back to the informational type of advertising</v>

4008
01:51:16.711 --> 01:51:18.480
<v Speaker 5>that existed in previous times.</v>

4009
01:51:18.481 --> 01:51:18.631
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

4010
01:51:18.631 --> 01:51:21.180
<v Speaker 5>you break the show and the guy comes out and he goes,</v>

4011
01:51:21.181 --> 01:51:21.630
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>

4012
01:51:21.630 --> 01:51:25.620
<v Speaker 5>I got the new Colgate toothpaste and the host of the show is actually showing</v>

4013
01:51:25.621 --> 01:51:27.000
<v Speaker 5>you what it is and what it does.</v>

4014
01:51:27.540 --> 01:51:31.230
<v Speaker 5>Seats advertising has moved so far in the abstract direction,</v>

4015
01:51:31.440 --> 01:51:31.741
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

4016
01:51:31.741 --> 01:51:33.330
<v Speaker 5>Where it's like you're advertising for beer,</v>

4017
01:51:33.331 --> 01:51:34.980
<v Speaker 5>but everyone's partying all the fucking time.</v>

4018
01:51:34.981 --> 01:51:35.161
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

4019
01:51:35.161 --> 01:51:35.994
<v Speaker 5>what am I buying?</v>

4020
01:51:36.360 --> 01:51:36.610
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

4021
01:51:36.610 --> 01:51:37.320
<v Speaker 5>in a party.</v>

4022
01:51:37.320 --> 01:51:38.820
<v Speaker 5>I'm buying a party in a bottle</v>

4023
01:51:38.880 --> 01:51:39.591
<v Speaker 1>right by a,</v>

4024
01:51:39.591 --> 01:51:40.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm hanging out with these guys that Lou,</v>

4025
01:51:41.200 --> 01:51:42.460
<v Speaker 5>their dream come true.</v>

4026
01:51:42.580 --> 01:51:46.900
<v Speaker 5>The problem is beer is not representative of the massive sphere that we have to</v>

4027
01:51:46.901 --> 01:51:47.531
<v Speaker 5>purchase within.</v>

4028
01:51:47.531 --> 01:51:49.210
<v Speaker 5>We needed by complicated shit too.</v>

4029
01:51:49.450 --> 01:51:49.900
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

4030
01:51:49.900 --> 01:51:51.460
<v Speaker 5>And you can't just tell me my life's better</v>

4031
01:51:51.550 --> 01:51:52.383
<v Speaker 1>cause I have it.</v>

4032
01:51:52.460 --> 01:51:53.121
<v Speaker 1>Well I need,</v>

4033
01:51:53.121 --> 01:51:54.020

<v Speaker 1>That's the place where you come in.</v>

01:52:01.700 --> 01:52:02.110
<v Speaker 1>Marquez,</v>

4043
01:52:02.110 --> 01:52:03.100
<v Speaker 5>I say Marquez.</v>

4044
01:52:03.130 --> 01:52:08.020
<v Speaker 5>He wound doesn't care if he's Marcus or Marquez M or F if we want to shout out</v>

4045
01:52:08.021 --> 01:52:08.451
<v Speaker 5>his channel,</v>

4046
01:52:08.451 --> 01:52:09.610
<v Speaker 5>it's Mkbhd</v>

4047
01:52:09.830 --> 01:52:10.641
<v Speaker 1>awesome reviews.</v>

4048
01:52:10.641 --> 01:52:11.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4049
01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:11.720
<v Speaker 1>Awesome reviews.</v>

4050
01:52:11.720 --> 01:52:12.521
<v Speaker 1>But the,</v>

4051
01:52:12.521 --> 01:52:16.070
<v Speaker 1>the kind of in depth coverage of electronics does,</v>

4052
01:52:16.071 --> 01:52:20.330
<v Speaker 1>did not exist even on like the screen savers even on,</v>

4053
01:52:20.360 --> 01:52:21.260
<v Speaker 1>they just couldn't,</v>

4054
01:52:21.320 --> 01:52:22.470
<v Speaker 1>there's no way you can,</v>

4055
01:52:22.580 --> 01:52:23.980
<v Speaker 1>and no one has that time.</v>

4056
01:52:24.770 --> 01:52:25.221
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

4057
01:52:25.221 --> 01:52:28.700
<v Speaker 1>it highlights the issues that people have with traditional media.</v>

4058
01:52:28.730 --> 01:52:28.971
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4059
01:52:28.971 --> 01:52:33.710
<v Speaker 1>it highlights the issues that people have with having a very specific time where</v>

4060
01:52:33.711 --> 01:52:34.720
<v Speaker 1>you have to tune into something.</v>

4061
01:52:34.770 --> 01:52:36.140
<v Speaker 1>It's true that that was it.</v>

4062
01:52:36.150 --> 01:52:38.150
<v Speaker 1>That's a huge barrier to creativity.</v>

4063
01:52:38.240 --> 01:52:38.451
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

4064
01:52:38.451 --> 01:52:39.284
<v Speaker 1>it's a man,</v>

4065
01:52:39.340 --> 01:52:44.340
<v Speaker 5>you have to build this messaging that's suitable for this huge amount of people</v>

4066
01:52:44.990 --> 01:52:46.010
<v Speaker 5>at one time.</v>

4067
01:52:46.280 --> 01:52:47.660
<v Speaker 2>Like you know the Superbowl,</v>

4068
01:52:47.720 --> 01:52:47.991
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4069
01:52:47.991 --> 01:52:51.170
<v Speaker 2>You spend $1 million for commercial because everybody's paying attention at that</v>

4070
01:52:51.171 --> 01:52:52.004
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

4071
01:52:52.100 --> 01:52:53.540
<v Speaker 2>But it's not targeted at all.</v>

4072
01:52:53.560 --> 01:52:53.870
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

4073
01:52:53.870 --> 01:52:56.210
<v Speaker 2>You're not reaching anybody specifically.</v>

4074
01:52:56.211 --> 01:52:56.481
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4075
01:52:56.481 --> 01:52:58.790
<v Speaker 2>maybe more dudes are watching it than women though.</v>

4076
01:52:58.791 --> 01:53:02.690
<v Speaker 2>I was amazed that the female figures is a lot of women watching it to everyone</v>

4077
01:53:02.691 --> 01:53:03.650
<v Speaker 2>in the house is watching it,</v>

4078
01:53:03.830 --> 01:53:08.830
<v Speaker 2>but ultimately is part of it is the shotgun approach PR part of it is just</v>

4079
01:53:09.231 --> 01:53:12.740
<v Speaker 2>getting the name of your God damned thing to as many people as possible.</v>

4080
01:53:12.980 --> 01:53:15.700
<v Speaker 2>But I think real decision making happens at a,</v>

4081
01:53:15.890 --> 01:53:17.120
<v Speaker 2>at a much deeper level.</v>

4082
01:53:17.510 --> 01:53:17.961
<v Speaker 2>Personally,</v>

4083
01:53:17.961 --> 01:53:18.681
<v Speaker 2>that's my feeling.</v>

4084
01:53:18.681 --> 01:53:21.110
<v Speaker 2>So awareness is point a,</v>

4085
01:53:21.530 --> 01:53:22.670
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

4086
01:53:23.050 --> 01:53:23.770
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4087
01:53:23.770 --> 01:53:24.680
<v Speaker 2>knowledge is,</v>

4088
01:53:24.770 --> 01:53:25.820
<v Speaker 2>is the next step.</v>

4089
01:53:26.030 --> 01:53:27.110
<v Speaker 2>So fine.</v>

4090
01:53:27.111 --> 01:53:29.330
<v Speaker 2>Make your introduction at the super bowl,</v>

4091
01:53:29.510 --> 01:53:30.321
<v Speaker 2>but that's not enough.</v>

4092
01:53:30.321 --> 01:53:31.220
<v Speaker 2>You can't stop there.</v>

4093
01:53:31.520 --> 01:53:31.791
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4094
01:53:31.791 --> 01:53:36.200
<v Speaker 2>And I think that also the kind of advertised like the difference between</v>

4095
01:53:36.201 --> 01:53:39.020
<v Speaker 2>advertising and informative</v>

4096
01:53:40.610 --> 01:53:41.390
<v Speaker 2>entertainment,</v>

4097
01:53:41.390 --> 01:53:42.590
<v Speaker 2>which is essentially what you're doing.</v>

4098
01:53:42.590 --> 01:53:43.070
<v Speaker 2>I mean you,</v>

4099
01:53:43.070 --> 01:53:43.311
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

4100
01:53:43.311 --> 01:53:44.540
<v Speaker 2>when you're doing what I'm doing.</v>

4101
01:53:44.541 --> 01:53:44.701
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4102
01:53:44.701 --> 01:53:45.050
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

4103
01:53:45.050 --> 01:53:47.120
<v Speaker 2>but brands are trying to do what I do now.</v>

4104
01:53:47.300 --> 01:53:50.120
<v Speaker 2>Like Samsung will do their own unboxing videos.</v>

4105
01:53:50.750 --> 01:53:51.470
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

4106
01:53:51.470 --> 01:53:52.303
<v Speaker 2>Hell yes.</v>

4107
01:53:52.340 --> 01:53:53.480
<v Speaker 2>And who does it for them?</v>

4108
01:53:54.560 --> 01:53:56.060
<v Speaker 2>Some random employee.</v>

4109
01:53:56.100 --> 01:53:56.933
<v Speaker 2>Rob's,</v>

4110
01:53:57.800 --> 01:53:58.490
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

4111
01:53:58.490 --> 01:53:59.330
<v Speaker 2>No seriously.</v>

4112
01:53:59.360 --> 01:54:00.040
<v Speaker 2>What is,</v>

4113
01:54:00.040 --> 01:54:03.120
<v Speaker 2>so it's not major mindblowing.</v>

4114
01:54:03.180 --> 01:54:03.560
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

4115
01:54:03.560 --> 01:54:05.480
<v Speaker 2>look one up later look up to,</v>

4116
01:54:05.570 --> 01:54:07.940
<v Speaker 2>I believe it was the s five or the note three.</v>

4117
01:54:08.370 --> 01:54:10.560
<v Speaker 2>A Korean girl did it for them.</v>

4118
01:54:10.610 --> 01:54:11.443
<v Speaker 2>You're not good.</v>

4119
01:54:12.030 --> 01:54:12.800
<v Speaker 2>Not a good job.</v>

4120
01:54:12.800 --> 01:54:14.390
<v Speaker 2>It's the whole thing off piece.</v>

4121
01:54:14.420 --> 01:54:16.850
<v Speaker 2>It feels the whole thing feels so bizarre.</v>

4122
01:54:17.270 --> 01:54:17.780
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

4123
01:54:17.780 --> 01:54:18.201
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

4124
01:54:18.201 --> 01:54:19.034
<v Speaker 2>you're hitting that,</v>

4125
01:54:19.580 --> 01:54:20.820
<v Speaker 2>you're hitting that force field,</v>

4126
01:54:20.840 --> 01:54:21.890
<v Speaker 2>you're hitting that sensor.</v>

4127
01:54:22.100 --> 01:54:23.030
<v Speaker 2>People are alerted,</v>

4128
01:54:23.150 --> 01:54:23.421
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4129
01:54:23.421 --> 01:54:24.254
<v Speaker 2>we're all,</v>

4130
01:54:24.950 --> 01:54:26.150
<v Speaker 2>that's what I love about it.</v>

4131
01:54:26.300 --> 01:54:30.640
<v Speaker 2>I love that sophisticated advertising or something that's a,</v>

4132
01:54:30.720 --> 01:54:31.110
<v Speaker 2>that you,</v>

4133
01:54:31.110 --> 01:54:32.390
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know if it's just advertising,</v>

4134
01:54:32.391 --> 01:54:35.900
<v Speaker 2>but sophisticated content drives a more sophisticated viewer.</v>

4135
01:54:35.960 --> 01:54:36.920
<v Speaker 2>I love that.</v>

4136
01:54:37.400 --> 01:54:41.510
<v Speaker 2>That all these people out there that experience my content now are going to hold</v>

4137
01:54:41.511 --> 01:54:42.980
<v Speaker 2>everything else up to that standard.</v>

4138
01:54:43.580 --> 01:54:44.330
<v Speaker 2>You see?</v>

4139
01:54:44.330 --> 01:54:44.990
<v Speaker 2>So you can,</v>

4140
01:54:44.990 --> 01:54:48.770
<v Speaker 2>you are literally pushing the entire marketplace marketplace by not fitting</v>

4141
01:54:48.771 --> 01:54:50.120
<v Speaker 2>within a particular paradigm.</v>

4142
01:54:51.050 --> 01:54:52.050
<v Speaker 2>That's so interesting,</v>

4143
01:54:52.051 --> 01:54:52.341
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

4144
01:54:52.341 --> 01:54:57.341
<v Speaker 2>And it's also kind of redefining how we view the information that we get on,</v>

4145
01:54:58.350 --> 01:54:59.510
<v Speaker 2>on each product.</v>

4146
01:54:59.511 --> 01:55:03.170
<v Speaker 2>Like it used to be the only information that you got about a new Chevy truck was</v>

4147
01:55:03.171 --> 01:55:05.170
<v Speaker 2>either reading about it in a magazine cause you,</v>

4148
01:55:05.240 --> 01:55:06.380
<v Speaker 2>you're so intrigued,</v>

4149
01:55:06.381 --> 01:55:09.770
<v Speaker 2>the pickup a Chevy truck magazine or you'd get an ad,</v>

4150
01:55:10.070 --> 01:55:11.780
<v Speaker 2>you'd see an ad for a Chevy truck.</v>

4151
01:55:11.781 --> 01:55:15.260
<v Speaker 2>Now you go online and you Chevy truck,</v>

4152
01:55:15.290 --> 01:55:16.520
<v Speaker 2>everyone knows you.</v>

4153
01:55:16.610 --> 01:55:17.443
<v Speaker 2>Everyone does.</v>

4154
01:55:17.540 --> 01:55:18.890
<v Speaker 2>And there's so many reviews.</v>

4155
01:55:19.400 --> 01:55:21.920
<v Speaker 2>I've been looking at a new SUV.</v>

4156
01:55:21.950 --> 01:55:22.251
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

4157
01:55:22.251 --> 01:55:23.820
<v Speaker 2>My lease is up on my SUV.</v>

4158
01:55:23.821 --> 01:55:26.990
<v Speaker 2>I'm just thinking about something else to get or a truck or whatever and I'm</v>

4159
01:55:27.050 --> 01:55:30.260
<v Speaker 2>reading all these different views and you get lost man.</v>

4160
01:55:30.410 --> 01:55:32.750
<v Speaker 2>It's almost an overload because he'd be like,</v>

4161
01:55:32.751 --> 01:55:34.550
<v Speaker 2>look up the Toyota Land Cruiser.</v>

4162
01:55:34.580 --> 01:55:34.851
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

4163
01:55:34.851 --> 01:55:35.930
<v Speaker 2>The Land Cruiser Binge.</v>

4164
01:55:35.960 --> 01:55:37.070
<v Speaker 2>You Binge on cruiser.</v>

4165
01:55:37.100 --> 01:55:37.671
<v Speaker 2>He been giant.</v>

4166
01:55:37.671 --> 01:55:38.600
<v Speaker 2>How much time did you spend?</v>

4167
01:55:38.840 --> 01:55:39.560
<v Speaker 2>Lots of hours.</v>

4168
01:55:39.560 --> 01:55:41.570
<v Speaker 2>How much time will you put into this purchase?</v>

4169
01:55:41.860 --> 01:55:41.990
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

4170
01:55:41.990 --> 01:55:43.070
<v Speaker 2>quite a bit more.</v>

4171
01:55:43.320 --> 01:55:43.921
<v Speaker 2>Anything else?</v>

4172
01:55:43.921 --> 01:55:44.720
<v Speaker 2>Because it's my,</v>

4173
01:55:44.720 --> 01:55:45.810
<v Speaker 2>the family vehicle,</v>

4174
01:55:45.930 --> 01:55:46.320
<v Speaker 2>so it's,</v>

4175
01:55:46.320 --> 01:55:50.670
<v Speaker 2>I want to make sure they're safe and they're big and they carry all our shit.</v>

4176
01:55:50.671 --> 01:55:53.780
<v Speaker 2>If we're going around where seats fold in a million different ways,</v>

4177
01:55:53.790 --> 01:55:55.780
<v Speaker 2>big entertainment thing.</v>

4178
01:55:55.781 --> 01:55:57.870
<v Speaker 2>So that I have a four year old and a six year old.</v>

4179
01:55:58.140 --> 01:56:01.350
<v Speaker 2>They get their little party on the back seat and everything's groovy.</v>

4180
01:56:01.351 --> 01:56:02.190
<v Speaker 2>Phone connection,</v>

4181
01:56:02.670 --> 01:56:04.690
<v Speaker 2>all the negativity.</v>

4182
01:56:05.040 --> 01:56:05.873
<v Speaker 2>The new one,</v>

4183
01:56:06.390 --> 01:56:07.320
<v Speaker 2>what's the thing called?</v>

4184
01:56:07.321 --> 01:56:08.220
<v Speaker 2>That's carplay.</v>

4185
01:56:08.250 --> 01:56:09.060
<v Speaker 2>Carplay.</v>

4186
01:56:09.060 --> 01:56:09.890
<v Speaker 2>What's that?</v>

4187
01:56:09.890 --> 01:56:10.430
<v Speaker 5>Well that's what,</v>

4188
01:56:10.430 --> 01:56:11.263
<v Speaker 5>that's what,</v>

4189
01:56:11.420 --> 01:56:13.730
<v Speaker 5>that's what we sort of had that conversation about Google.</v>

4190
01:56:13.731 --> 01:56:14.630
<v Speaker 5>They're doing their own version,</v>

4191
01:56:14.631 --> 01:56:15.320
<v Speaker 5>but apple has it.</v>

4192
01:56:15.320 --> 01:56:19.760
<v Speaker 5>They're eaten car in car software and they have a few automakers,</v>

4193
01:56:19.790 --> 01:56:20.361
<v Speaker 5>automakers,</v>

4194
01:56:20.361 --> 01:56:24.230
<v Speaker 5>they've aligned with to put essentially an iPhone experience in your dash,</v>

4195
01:56:24.260 --> 01:56:25.820
<v Speaker 5>so you no longer have that dumb unit.</v>

4196
01:56:26.140 --> 01:56:28.810
<v Speaker 2>You know what they're doing also for a lot of back seats,</v>

4197
01:56:29.050 --> 01:56:31.690
<v Speaker 2>they have this thing where you lock in an iPad.</v>

4198
01:56:31.960 --> 01:56:32.491
<v Speaker 2>Oh right.</v>

4199
01:56:32.491 --> 01:56:33.640
<v Speaker 2>And just his watch pocket.</v>

4200
01:56:33.641 --> 01:56:34.900
<v Speaker 2>Just paste it right in there.</v>

4201
01:56:34.930 --> 01:56:38.750
<v Speaker 2>The kids watch their IPAD and they also have games that they can play on it.</v>

4202
01:56:38.751 --> 01:56:41.290
<v Speaker 2>And they also have their own individual ear jack.</v>

4203
01:56:41.380 --> 01:56:42.213
<v Speaker 2>Oh definitely.</v>

4204
01:56:42.270 --> 01:56:43.091
<v Speaker 2>Or that's awesome.</v>

4205
01:56:43.091 --> 01:56:44.860
<v Speaker 2>Bluetooth within the device.</v>

4206
01:56:45.190 --> 01:56:47.020
<v Speaker 2>So they have wireless headphones.</v>

4207
01:56:47.230 --> 01:56:47.680
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4208
01:56:47.680 --> 01:56:52.000
<v Speaker 2>Mommy and daddy don't have to listen to the fucking frozen for the hundredth</v>

4209
01:56:52.001 --> 01:56:52.700
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

4210
01:56:52.700 --> 01:56:53.531
<v Speaker 2>That's thinking about kids,</v>

4211
01:56:53.531 --> 01:56:54.100
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

4212
01:56:54.100 --> 01:56:54.820
<v Speaker 2>It's cute.</v>

4213
01:56:54.820 --> 01:56:55.631
<v Speaker 2>It's adorable.</v>

4214
01:56:55.631 --> 01:56:56.950
<v Speaker 2>But once they love something,</v>

4215
01:56:56.951 --> 01:57:00.940
<v Speaker 2>they just want to watch it over and over and over and over and over.</v>

4216
01:57:01.150 --> 01:57:02.260
<v Speaker 2>I went through tangled.</v>

4217
01:57:02.470 --> 01:57:04.630
<v Speaker 2>I went through a period of watching tangled.</v>

4218
01:57:04.900 --> 01:57:06.070
<v Speaker 2>I probably saw it a hundred times,</v>

4219
01:57:06.340 --> 01:57:06.790
<v Speaker 2>probably.</v>

4220
01:57:06.790 --> 01:57:08.530
<v Speaker 2>So that yet.</v>

4221
01:57:08.560 --> 01:57:09.220
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4222
01:57:09.220 --> 01:57:09.760
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

4223
01:57:09.760 --> 01:57:10.593
<v Speaker 2>Minor American.</v>

4224
01:57:11.300 --> 01:57:12.133
<v Speaker 2>Different than yours.</v>

4225
01:57:12.160 --> 01:57:12.721
<v Speaker 2>My kids are different.</v>

4226
01:57:12.721 --> 01:57:13.600
<v Speaker 2>Definitely have different DNA.</v>

4227
01:57:13.660 --> 01:57:14.091
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4228
01:57:14.091 --> 01:57:14.924
<v Speaker 2>they're not.</v>

4229
01:57:15.300 --> 01:57:15.420
<v Speaker 2>You.</v>

4230
01:57:15.420 --> 01:57:15.870
<v Speaker 5>I know.</v>

4231
01:57:15.870 --> 01:57:16.703
<v Speaker 5>Mine.</v>

4232
01:57:16.830 --> 01:57:18.470
<v Speaker 5>My two year old especially.</v>

4233
01:57:18.560 --> 01:57:19.830
<v Speaker 5>You got to remember they had like,</v>

4234
01:57:19.950 --> 01:57:21.390
<v Speaker 5>they'd had all the technology,</v>

4235
01:57:21.420 --> 01:57:23.310
<v Speaker 5>all the video games since day one.</v>

4236
01:57:23.370 --> 01:57:24.940
<v Speaker 5>So no Waldorf School for your kid.</v>

4237
01:57:25.690 --> 01:57:26.370
<v Speaker 5>Fuck No.</v>

4238
01:57:26.370 --> 01:57:27.390
<v Speaker 5>Do you know about Waldorf School?</v>

4239
01:57:27.391 --> 01:57:28.450
<v Speaker 5>They make you play with the wooden toys?</v>

4240
01:57:28.451 --> 01:57:29.400
<v Speaker 5>I had a friend who went there.</v>

4241
01:57:29.401 --> 01:57:29.611
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4242
01:57:29.611 --> 01:57:30.470
<v Speaker 5>No electronics.</v>

4243
01:57:30.480 --> 01:57:30.960
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4244
01:57:30.960 --> 01:57:31.141
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4245
01:57:31.141 --> 01:57:31.530
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

4246
01:57:31.530 --> 01:57:31.830
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

4247
01:57:31.830 --> 01:57:32.351
<v Speaker 5>None of that.</v>

4248
01:57:32.351 --> 01:57:33.184
<v Speaker 5>Nice kids.</v>

4249
01:57:34.270 --> 01:57:34.680
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

4250
01:57:34.680 --> 01:57:35.513
<v Speaker 5>that's subjective.</v>

4251
01:57:35.970 --> 01:57:37.290
<v Speaker 5>Nicest a subjective word,</v>

4252
01:57:37.590 --> 01:57:38.040
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

4253
01:57:38.040 --> 01:57:38.690
<v Speaker 5>I agree.</v>

4254
01:57:38.690 --> 01:57:39.480
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

4255
01:57:39.480 --> 01:57:40.110
<v Speaker 5>but no,</v>

4256
01:57:40.110 --> 01:57:40.441
<v Speaker 5>listen,</v>

4257
01:57:40.441 --> 01:57:41.310
<v Speaker 5>I'm immersed in it.</v>

4258
01:57:41.850 --> 01:57:43.470
<v Speaker 5>I want to connect with them.</v>

4259
01:57:43.740 --> 01:57:44.340
<v Speaker 5>How am I,</v>

4260
01:57:44.340 --> 01:57:45.001
<v Speaker 5>in fact,</v>

4261
01:57:45.001 --> 01:57:47.700
<v Speaker 5>will's been in a bunch of my videos my four year old lately.</v>

4262
01:57:48.100 --> 01:57:48.420
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

4263
01:57:48.420 --> 01:57:52.740
<v Speaker 5>which is amazing because half of the shit he sees it come in the house,</v>

4264
01:57:53.520 --> 01:57:53.831
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4265
01:57:53.831 --> 01:57:54.090
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

4266
01:57:54.090 --> 01:57:56.580
<v Speaker 5>and he doesn't get to participate in that part of it.</v>

4267
01:57:56.581 --> 01:57:57.414
<v Speaker 5>So I think I have the,</v>

4268
01:57:57.450 --> 01:57:57.991
<v Speaker 5>in that sense,</v>

4269
01:57:57.991 --> 01:57:58.800
<v Speaker 5>I have the coolest job.</v>

4270
01:57:58.800 --> 01:57:59.730
<v Speaker 5>I get to do shit with him,</v>

4271
01:58:00.330 --> 01:58:00.601
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

4272
01:58:00.601 --> 01:58:01.434
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

4273
01:58:01.500 --> 01:58:01.961
<v Speaker 5>and most of it,</v>

4274
01:58:01.961 --> 01:58:03.510
<v Speaker 5>and every time it's him driving it,</v>

4275
01:58:03.511 --> 01:58:03.991
<v Speaker 5>not me.</v>

4276
01:58:03.991 --> 01:58:04.711
<v Speaker 5>So for the audience,</v>

4277
01:58:04.711 --> 01:58:06.210
<v Speaker 5>it's like you're exploiting him or whatever.</v>

4278
01:58:06.510 --> 01:58:08.700
<v Speaker 5>This is him nagging me weeks on end.</v>

4279
01:58:08.730 --> 01:58:09.660
<v Speaker 5>Let's make another video.</v>

4280
01:58:09.810 --> 01:58:10.730
<v Speaker 5>Four years old likes it.</v>

4281
01:58:10.770 --> 01:58:11.603
<v Speaker 5>He loves it.</v>

4282
01:58:11.610 --> 01:58:12.150
<v Speaker 5>He is fun.</v>

4283
01:58:12.150 --> 01:58:12.960
<v Speaker 5>He loves it.</v>

4284
01:58:12.960 --> 01:58:16.080
<v Speaker 5>But they're so into this world that,</v>

4285
01:58:16.390 --> 01:58:16.710
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4286
01:58:16.710 --> 01:58:17.910
<v Speaker 5>like youtube for example,</v>

4287
01:58:17.911 --> 01:58:19.560
<v Speaker 5>they give them an iPad.</v>

4288
01:58:19.561 --> 01:58:20.850
<v Speaker 5>They know how to navigate youtube.</v>

4289
01:58:21.240 --> 01:58:22.530
<v Speaker 5>And this is the craziest part,</v>

4290
01:58:22.770 --> 01:58:23.041
<v Speaker 5>and I,</v>

4291
01:58:23.041 --> 01:58:24.570
<v Speaker 5>and I've talked about this before as well.</v>

4292
01:58:24.571 --> 01:58:26.910
<v Speaker 5>It's like the consumption thing that I'm in,</v>

4293
01:58:26.911 --> 01:58:28.140
<v Speaker 5>like the product world,</v>

4294
01:58:28.141 --> 01:58:29.310
<v Speaker 5>the tech world,</v>

4295
01:58:29.430 --> 01:58:33.480
<v Speaker 5>it exists for different spectrums to like makeup and beauty and kids.</v>

4296
01:58:33.481 --> 01:58:34.120
<v Speaker 5>Shit,</v>

4297
01:58:34.120 --> 01:58:34.530
<v Speaker 5>Ma,</v>

4298
01:58:34.530 --> 01:58:35.670
<v Speaker 5>they research their toys,</v>

4299
01:58:35.671 --> 01:58:36.504
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

4300
01:58:36.660 --> 01:58:38.400
<v Speaker 5>They researched the stuff they want.</v>

4301
01:58:38.470 --> 01:58:38.910
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4302
01:58:38.910 --> 01:58:40.470
<v Speaker 5>So they were watching Plato sets.</v>

4303
01:58:40.530 --> 01:58:42.250
<v Speaker 5>They're watching car sets.</v>

4304
01:58:42.250 --> 01:58:43.780
<v Speaker 2>They're watching Lego,</v>

4305
01:58:44.140 --> 01:58:45.160
<v Speaker 2>Lego man.</v>

4306
01:58:45.460 --> 01:58:47.950
<v Speaker 2>So they're getting started even earlier than me.</v>

4307
01:58:48.070 --> 01:58:48.791
<v Speaker 2>Not only that,</v>

4308
01:58:48.791 --> 01:58:51.240
<v Speaker 2>those toys get reviewed and that's right.</v>

4309
01:58:51.241 --> 01:58:52.750
<v Speaker 2>The star rating system.</v>

4310
01:58:52.751 --> 01:58:53.350
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

4311
01:58:53.350 --> 01:58:56.860
<v Speaker 2>I'll give you go to Amazon and you look up children's toys,</v>

4312
01:58:56.980 --> 01:59:01.270
<v Speaker 2>you'll see a rating system and comments at the parents and the children will</v>

4313
01:59:01.271 --> 01:59:04.540
<v Speaker 2>even like tell the parents what they like or don't like about a toy.</v>

4314
01:59:04.690 --> 01:59:07.060
<v Speaker 2>And the parents talk about like this failed quality,</v>

4315
01:59:07.630 --> 01:59:08.470
<v Speaker 2>which she used to.</v>

4316
01:59:08.700 --> 01:59:11.500
<v Speaker 2>I used to have to like read consumer reports or find out,</v>

4317
01:59:11.501 --> 01:59:11.890
<v Speaker 2>right</v>

4318
01:59:11.890 --> 01:59:16.690
<v Speaker 5>if it was even safe or dangerous toys that broken stabbed you and you felt,</v>

4319
01:59:16.720 --> 01:59:17.553
<v Speaker 5>Oh uh,</v>

4320
01:59:17.950 --> 01:59:22.390
<v Speaker 5>the high chairs recall a fucking high chair cause people are falling over or</v>

4321
01:59:22.391 --> 01:59:23.020
<v Speaker 5>whatever.</v>

4322
01:59:23.020 --> 01:59:24.520
<v Speaker 5>Now all that shit's out in the open.</v>

4323
01:59:24.760 --> 01:59:25.391
<v Speaker 5>It's amazing.</v>

4324
01:59:25.391 --> 01:59:25.661
<v Speaker 5>You see.</v>

4325
01:59:25.661 --> 01:59:26.590
<v Speaker 5>But here's the thing,</v>

4326
01:59:26.591 --> 01:59:27.460
<v Speaker 5>it's like if,</v>

4327
01:59:27.610 --> 01:59:30.100
<v Speaker 5>if the blockbuster guys are on one end of the spectrum,</v>

4328
01:59:30.310 --> 01:59:31.870
<v Speaker 5>poor fucking blockbuster guys,</v>

4329
01:59:31.871 --> 01:59:33.200
<v Speaker 5>I keep on calling them out,</v>

4330
01:59:33.430 --> 01:59:34.270
<v Speaker 5>they still exist.</v>

4331
01:59:34.300 --> 01:59:36.010
<v Speaker 5>Those are real guys that are listening right now.</v>

4332
01:59:36.250 --> 01:59:37.660
<v Speaker 5>Probably not poor bastards.</v>

4333
01:59:37.661 --> 01:59:38.170
<v Speaker 5>Anyway.</v>

4334
01:59:38.170 --> 01:59:41.800
<v Speaker 5>If the blockbuster guys are on one end of the spectrum and my kids are on the</v>

4335
01:59:41.801 --> 01:59:46.801
<v Speaker 5>other because I'm already completely sensitized to the traditional media</v>

4336
01:59:47.201 --> 01:59:47.681
<v Speaker 5>messaging,</v>

4337
01:59:47.681 --> 01:59:49.240
<v Speaker 5>like it's not going to fucking work on me.</v>

4338
01:59:49.420 --> 01:59:51.400
<v Speaker 5>It sure as fuck isn't going to work on them.</v>

4339
01:59:51.570 --> 01:59:52.210
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

4340
01:59:52.210 --> 01:59:53.860
<v Speaker 5>they know how to get around it.</v>

4341
01:59:53.920 --> 01:59:54.581
<v Speaker 2>Not only that,</v>

4342
01:59:54.581 --> 01:59:55.810
<v Speaker 2>they're from the Joe.</v>

4343
01:59:55.840 --> 01:59:56.673
<v Speaker 2>How old are you?</v>

4344
01:59:56.920 --> 01:59:58.840
<v Speaker 2>29 I'm 46 right,</v>

4345
01:59:58.841 --> 02:00:03.010
<v Speaker 2>so obviously I dealt with a lot of years where there was no influence</v>

4346
02:00:03.011 --> 02:00:03.491
<v Speaker 2>whatsoever.</v>

4347
02:00:03.491 --> 02:00:03.880
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

4348
02:00:03.880 --> 02:00:08.080
<v Speaker 2>By the common person with social media and the ability to spread information</v>

4349
02:00:08.230 --> 02:00:10.810
<v Speaker 2>like a guy like you didn't exist when I was young,</v>

4350
02:00:10.960 --> 02:00:13.630
<v Speaker 5>my job didn't exist when I was in high school.</v>

4351
02:00:13.690 --> 02:00:16.120
<v Speaker 5>My guidance counselor couldn't have told me what the fuck I was going to be</v>

4352
02:00:16.121 --> 02:00:17.440
<v Speaker 5>doing cause youtube wasn't even a thing.</v>

4353
02:00:18.250 --> 02:00:19.570
<v Speaker 2>He probably wouldn't have told you to do it anymore.</v>

4354
02:00:21.250 --> 02:00:23.260
<v Speaker 2>Guide what guidance counselors can I tell you,</v>

4355
02:00:23.350 --> 02:00:23.711
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>

4356
02:00:23.711 --> 02:00:25.080
<v Speaker 2>you should make some youtube videos.</v>

4357
02:00:25.390 --> 02:00:27.520
<v Speaker 2>I get that question more than anything else from young people.</v>

4358
02:00:27.521 --> 02:00:28.354
<v Speaker 2>How do I do what you do?</v>

4359
02:00:28.510 --> 02:00:29.450
<v Speaker 2>It's a number one question.</v>

4360
02:00:29.451 --> 02:00:30.820
<v Speaker 2>It just start doing it right.</v>

4361
02:00:30.850 --> 02:00:31.683
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

4362
02:00:31.950 --> 02:00:32.480
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4363
02:00:32.480 --> 02:00:34.450
<v Speaker 2>those people that are asking that question,</v>

4364
02:00:34.900 --> 02:00:35.560
<v Speaker 2>knuckleheads,</v>

4365
02:00:35.560 --> 02:00:36.450
<v Speaker 2>stop with the questions.</v>

4366
02:00:36.490 --> 02:00:37.420
<v Speaker 2>Just go do something.</v>

4367
02:00:37.810 --> 02:00:38.980
<v Speaker 2>That's the problem with people.</v>

4368
02:00:38.981 --> 02:00:41.380
<v Speaker 2>They like to talk about shit so much.</v>

4369
02:00:41.381 --> 02:00:42.640
<v Speaker 2>They don't actually do shit.</v>

4370
02:00:42.850 --> 02:00:45.160
<v Speaker 2>I've been reading Stephen King's book on writing,</v>

4371
02:00:45.220 --> 02:00:46.300
<v Speaker 2>which is a great book.</v>

4372
02:00:46.330 --> 02:00:50.890
<v Speaker 2>Or I was reading it this weekend and I'm one of the great things about the book</v>

4373
02:00:50.891 --> 02:00:51.730
<v Speaker 2>and he says like,</v>

4374
02:00:51.790 --> 02:00:54.730
<v Speaker 2>don't even talk about writing so much.</v>

4375
02:00:54.880 --> 02:00:56.020
<v Speaker 2>Like you should just go.</v>

4376
02:00:56.021 --> 02:00:56.450
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

4377
02:00:56.450 --> 02:00:57.281
<v Speaker 2>Just get it done.</v>

4378
02:00:57.281 --> 02:00:58.690
<v Speaker 2>Like in a lot of times people,</v>

4379
02:00:58.691 --> 02:01:00.820
<v Speaker 2>and this is also in Steven Pressfield's book,</v>

4380
02:01:00.821 --> 02:01:01.654
<v Speaker 2>the war of art.</v>

4381
02:01:01.870 --> 02:01:04.750
<v Speaker 2>A lot of times people will distract themselves from the actual work at hand by</v>

4382
02:01:04.751 --> 02:01:05.584
<v Speaker 2>talking about it.</v>

4383
02:01:05.630 --> 02:01:07.000
<v Speaker 2>Some definitely.</v>

4384
02:01:07.030 --> 02:01:07.680
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4385
02:01:07.680 --> 02:01:08.110
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4386
02:01:08.110 --> 02:01:09.040
<v Speaker 2>I completely feel that way.</v>

4387
02:01:09.041 --> 02:01:09.281
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

4388
02:01:09.281 --> 02:01:10.150
<v Speaker 2>in my studio,</v>

4389
02:01:10.151 --> 02:01:15.151
<v Speaker 2>I tried to create it in such a fashion where the friction between me starting</v>

4390
02:01:15.251 --> 02:01:16.720
<v Speaker 2>something and not starting something,</v>

4391
02:01:16.721 --> 02:01:17.950
<v Speaker 2>is that the lowest level possible?</v>

4392
02:01:17.951 --> 02:01:18.910
<v Speaker 2>You've done the same thing here,</v>

4393
02:01:18.911 --> 02:01:19.744
<v Speaker 2>obviously.</v>

4394
02:01:20.020 --> 02:01:20.351
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4395
02:01:20.351 --> 02:01:20.770
<v Speaker 2>Jesus,</v>

4396
02:01:20.770 --> 02:01:22.030
<v Speaker 2>you just sit down and go,</v>

4397
02:01:22.100 --> 02:01:22.380
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

4398
02:01:22.380 --> 02:01:22.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4399
02:01:22.600 --> 02:01:23.321
<v Speaker 2>and that's the key.</v>

4400
02:01:23.321 --> 02:01:25.030
<v Speaker 2>Because human beings,</v>

4401
02:01:25.031 --> 02:01:27.460
<v Speaker 2>we will naturally find ways out of doing.</v>

4402
02:01:27.480 --> 02:01:27.691
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4403
02:01:27.691 --> 02:01:28.990
<v Speaker 2>we know we're supposed to be doing,</v>

4404
02:01:29.320 --> 02:01:30.460
<v Speaker 2>but this is easy to do.</v>

4405
02:01:30.461 --> 02:01:34.250
<v Speaker 2>This is like at all the things that I do that require me to do it.</v>

4406
02:01:34.290 --> 02:01:35.170
<v Speaker 2>Whether it's writing,</v>

4407
02:01:35.171 --> 02:01:36.130
<v Speaker 2>being the most difficult,</v>

4408
02:01:36.131 --> 02:01:37.780
<v Speaker 2>standup being the least difficult.</v>

4409
02:01:37.990 --> 02:01:42.050
<v Speaker 2>This is the easiest standup being the least if oh to get me to do.</v>

4410
02:01:42.110 --> 02:01:42.291
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

4411
02:01:42.291 --> 02:01:42.740
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

4412
02:01:42.740 --> 02:01:43.920
<v Speaker 2>I got a lot of doing standup.</v>

4413
02:01:43.960 --> 02:01:44.810
<v Speaker 2>It's really fun.</v>

4414
02:01:44.840 --> 02:01:45.170
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

4415
02:01:45.170 --> 02:01:45.890
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4416
02:01:45.890 --> 02:01:49.280
<v Speaker 2>it's probably the most difficult to get right.</v>

4417
02:01:49.880 --> 02:01:52.280
<v Speaker 2>This is probably the easiest out of all the things that I do.</v>

4418
02:01:53.360 --> 02:01:55.160
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that all things that I do,</v>

4419
02:01:55.870 --> 02:01:57.140
<v Speaker 2>it might be to you,</v>

4420
02:01:57.230 --> 02:01:58.730
<v Speaker 2>but I mean to the average person,</v>

4421
02:01:58.760 --> 02:02:01.220
<v Speaker 2>I think this format is,</v>

4422
02:02:01.250 --> 02:02:06.250
<v Speaker 2>it requires a certain openness about yourself because to do a set,</v>

4423
02:02:07.910 --> 02:02:08.743
<v Speaker 2>are you re,</v>

4424
02:02:08.870 --> 02:02:13.220
<v Speaker 2>are you revealing as much about yourself and a comedy set as you are in a three</v>

4425
02:02:13.221 --> 02:02:14.090
<v Speaker 2>hour conversation?</v>

4426
02:02:14.120 --> 02:02:16.370
<v Speaker 2>You definitely may reveal more than a three hour conversation,</v>

4427
02:02:16.371 --> 02:02:16.910
<v Speaker 2>I would think.</v>

4428
02:02:16.910 --> 02:02:18.020
<v Speaker 2>I would think so too.</v>

4429
02:02:18.070 --> 02:02:18.680
<v Speaker 2>You can,</v>

4430
02:02:18.680 --> 02:02:20.810
<v Speaker 2>especially when you do 500 of them.</v>

4431
02:02:20.850 --> 02:02:21.683
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm saying.</v>

4432
02:02:22.110 --> 02:02:22.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4433
02:02:22.370 --> 02:02:26.330
<v Speaker 2>that's me get a sense and a lot of people I know the barrier that's holding them</v>

4434
02:02:26.331 --> 02:02:29.750
<v Speaker 2>back in the first place is insecurity about who they are or what they have to</v>

4435
02:02:29.751 --> 02:02:31.550
<v Speaker 2>share or whether or not anyone gives a fuck.</v>

4436
02:02:31.880 --> 02:02:32.330
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4437
02:02:32.330 --> 02:02:32.690
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

4438
02:02:32.690 --> 02:02:36.770
<v Speaker 2>that's a much tougher place to put them in this seat where they're expected to</v>

4439
02:02:36.771 --> 02:02:41.390
<v Speaker 2>show who they are for three hours instead of mastering this really perfect</v>

4440
02:02:41.391 --> 02:02:42.740
<v Speaker 2>little box,</v>

4441
02:02:42.741 --> 02:02:44.570
<v Speaker 2>this little thing that represents them.</v>

4442
02:02:44.720 --> 02:02:45.500
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

4443
02:02:45.500 --> 02:02:46.333
<v Speaker 2>Like I think,</v>

4444
02:02:46.630 --> 02:02:47.001
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4445
02:02:47.001 --> 02:02:51.140
<v Speaker 2>I make most of my videos are three to five minutes long and I think a person</v>

4446
02:02:51.141 --> 02:02:53.900
<v Speaker 2>could listen to this podcast right here and know more about me than if they</v>

4447
02:02:53.901 --> 02:02:55.460
<v Speaker 2>watched 500 of them.</v>

4448
02:02:55.550 --> 02:02:55.701
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

4449
02:02:55.701 --> 02:02:56.570
<v Speaker 2>most certainly.</v>

4450
02:02:56.780 --> 02:02:58.790
<v Speaker 2>What's the longest you've ever done a video for?</v>

4451
02:02:58.970 --> 02:03:02.420
<v Speaker 2>Anything that's like really complex that warrants a much longer,</v>

4452
02:03:02.421 --> 02:03:02.871
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4453
02:03:02.871 --> 02:03:04.310
<v Speaker 2>you can get up into like 10,</v>

4454
02:03:04.311 --> 02:03:04.881
<v Speaker 2>15,</v>

4455
02:03:04.881 --> 02:03:06.050
<v Speaker 2>maybe 15,</v>

4456
02:03:06.051 --> 02:03:06.561
<v Speaker 2>like what would it be?</v>

4457
02:03:06.561 --> 02:03:10.880
<v Speaker 2>15 like a new phone or something like really competent kind of comparison like</v>

4458
02:03:10.881 --> 02:03:12.470
<v Speaker 2>something versus something else.</v>

4459
02:03:12.500 --> 02:03:14.580
<v Speaker 2>But you don't like limit yourself like you,</v>

4460
02:03:14.750 --> 02:03:15.640
<v Speaker 2>well there's this it.</v>

4461
02:03:16.940 --> 02:03:17.760
<v Speaker 2>Listen if you're getting,</v>

4462
02:03:17.760 --> 02:03:19.820
<v Speaker 2>you had to be smart in anything that you,</v>

4463
02:03:19.880 --> 02:03:24.680
<v Speaker 2>that you do if you're investing a lot of time in it and so there is definitely a</v>

4464
02:03:24.681 --> 02:03:25.640
<v Speaker 2>retention issue.</v>

4465
02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:26.833
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

4466
02:03:26.900 --> 02:03:30.230
<v Speaker 2>if we're willing to identify the fact that consumption habits are changing and</v>

4467
02:03:30.231 --> 02:03:33.830
<v Speaker 2>the web is the driving force behind that and we also need to be cognizant of the</v>

4468
02:03:33.831 --> 02:03:38.330
<v Speaker 2>fact that we need to fit within a certain fit within certain boundaries.</v>

4469
02:03:38.331 --> 02:03:41.180
<v Speaker 2>Even though those boundaries are loose and no one's going to fucking tell you</v>

4470
02:03:41.181 --> 02:03:42.014
<v Speaker 2>one way or the other.</v>

4471
02:03:42.590 --> 02:03:45.620
<v Speaker 2>A lot of the conversations I have in brainstorming that I do is about</v>

4472
02:03:45.621 --> 02:03:50.510
<v Speaker 2>hyper-focusing and iterating and finding better ways of reaching people and we</v>

4473
02:03:50.511 --> 02:03:51.140
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

4474
02:03:51.140 --> 02:03:52.220
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of us,</v>

4475
02:03:52.250 --> 02:03:56.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm speaking I guess for the community as a whole have figured out that three to</v>

4476
02:03:56.151 --> 02:03:58.010
<v Speaker 2>five minutes is just what makes sense.</v>

4477
02:03:58.650 --> 02:04:01.640
<v Speaker 2>Three to five minutes is a song length as well.</v>

4478
02:04:01.760 --> 02:04:02.151
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4479
02:04:02.151 --> 02:04:02.984
<v Speaker 2>it's a really weird,</v>

4480
02:04:02.990 --> 02:04:04.550
<v Speaker 2>it's really weird that it lines up that way.</v>

4481
02:04:04.640 --> 02:04:06.020
<v Speaker 2>Three minutes is what they say.</v>

4482
02:04:06.021 --> 02:04:06.320
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

4483
02:04:06.320 --> 02:04:07.770
<v Speaker 2>You see like something</v>

4484
02:04:09.320 --> 02:04:09.950
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

4485
02:04:09.950 --> 02:04:10.783
<v Speaker 2>Something weird.</v>

4486
02:04:11.270 --> 02:04:13.280
<v Speaker 2>We don't have a youtube up there right now,</v>

4487
02:04:13.281 --> 02:04:16.160
<v Speaker 2>but if you look at the youtube interface,</v>

4488
02:04:16.190 --> 02:04:19.820
<v Speaker 2>it's a lot of thought goes into the way things are laid out.</v>

4489
02:04:19.821 --> 02:04:21.590
<v Speaker 2>People freak out whenever anything changes.</v>

4490
02:04:21.591 --> 02:04:23.000
<v Speaker 2>And why the fuck is that?</v>

4491
02:04:23.010 --> 02:04:25.370
<v Speaker 2>Their Google stupid people love seeing the shit like that.</v>

4492
02:04:25.400 --> 02:04:25.481
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4493
02:04:25.481 --> 02:04:28.070
<v Speaker 2>Youtube does a pretty decent job of setting up.</v>

4494
02:04:28.071 --> 02:04:29.870
<v Speaker 2>Like if you watch click on one of those videos,</v>

4495
02:04:29.871 --> 02:04:30.560
<v Speaker 2>Brian,</v>

4496
02:04:30.560 --> 02:04:31.910
<v Speaker 2>like one of your videos,</v>

4497
02:04:32.060 --> 02:04:34.490
<v Speaker 2>you would look on the right and you get suggested stuff.</v>

4498
02:04:34.520 --> 02:04:34.930
<v Speaker 2>Others.</v>

4499
02:04:34.930 --> 02:04:35.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4500
02:04:35.110 --> 02:04:35.510
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

4501
02:04:35.510 --> 02:04:38.310
<v Speaker 2>that's what sends you down those rabbit holes.</v>

4502
02:04:39.030 --> 02:04:40.320
<v Speaker 2>That's where shit gets weird.</v>

4503
02:04:40.321 --> 02:04:40.891
<v Speaker 2>But here's the,</v>

4504
02:04:40.891 --> 02:04:43.410
<v Speaker 2>so here's the thing about this frame right now that we're looking at,</v>

4505
02:04:44.670 --> 02:04:48.600
<v Speaker 2>at what point does this video become less enticing than the juicy shit on the</v>

4506
02:04:48.601 --> 02:04:49.380
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

4507
02:04:49.380 --> 02:04:50.213
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

4508
02:04:50.580 --> 02:04:51.540
<v Speaker 2>He say he Fullscreen did,</v>

4509
02:04:51.541 --> 02:04:52.410
<v Speaker 2>so he kind of killed it.</v>

4510
02:04:52.410 --> 02:04:53.460
<v Speaker 2>But full screening,</v>

4511
02:04:53.461 --> 02:04:55.590
<v Speaker 2>it definitely does Fullscreen and it does.</v>

4512
02:04:55.950 --> 02:04:56.280
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

4513
02:04:56.280 --> 02:04:58.320
<v Speaker 2>But why is it youtube not by default,</v>

4514
02:04:58.350 --> 02:04:59.460
<v Speaker 2>a Fullscreen interface?</v>

4515
02:05:00.090 --> 02:05:00.840
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4516
02:05:00.840 --> 02:05:04.350
<v Speaker 2>because they're about view times as a whole.</v>

4517
02:05:04.870 --> 02:05:06.120
<v Speaker 2>Can we talk about this last time?</v>

4518
02:05:06.270 --> 02:05:06.780
<v Speaker 2>Did that,</v>

4519
02:05:06.780 --> 02:05:07.290
<v Speaker 2>did we?</v>

4520
02:05:07.290 --> 02:05:08.123
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember,</v>

4521
02:05:08.340 --> 02:05:09.780
<v Speaker 2>but that totally makes sense.</v>

4522
02:05:09.781 --> 02:05:10.680
<v Speaker 2>The way they're designed.</v>

4523
02:05:10.681 --> 02:05:12.060
<v Speaker 2>I think it's the perfect design.</v>

4524
02:05:12.210 --> 02:05:17.210
<v Speaker 2>Also the comments as a name and retarded and fucking aggravating as they can be.</v>

4525
02:05:18.420 --> 02:05:22.380
<v Speaker 2>They engage people and get people to spend more time participate.</v>

4526
02:05:22.530 --> 02:05:27.210
<v Speaker 2>There's some folks that just do not have an outlet and I think that's sometimes</v>

4527
02:05:27.211 --> 02:05:32.211
<v Speaker 2>reflected in the angry and anger and vitriol that you see exhibited on a youtube</v>

4528
02:05:32.911 --> 02:05:33.420
<v Speaker 2>page.</v>

4529
02:05:33.420 --> 02:05:36.720
<v Speaker 2>It's not even representative oftentimes of what they're actually reviewing.</v>

4530
02:05:36.880 --> 02:05:37.160
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

4531
02:05:37.160 --> 02:05:40.550
<v Speaker 2>it's a reflection of their own life is that people don't feel like they are</v>

4532
02:05:40.551 --> 02:05:41.280
<v Speaker 2>heard.</v>

4533
02:05:41.280 --> 02:05:42.630
<v Speaker 2>They don't feel like they matter.</v>

4534
02:05:42.720 --> 02:05:44.280
<v Speaker 2>They don't feel like they have a voice.</v>

4535
02:05:44.430 --> 02:05:46.200
<v Speaker 2>And then finally when they do have a voice,</v>

4536
02:05:46.201 --> 02:05:47.034
<v Speaker 2>like</v>

4537
02:05:48.210 --> 02:05:49.920
<v Speaker 2>what they're saying is no one wants to fuck me.</v>

4538
02:05:49.921 --> 02:05:51.360
<v Speaker 2>My boss is an asshole.</v>

4539
02:05:51.480 --> 02:05:52.980
<v Speaker 2>I picked the shitty career.</v>

4540
02:05:53.220 --> 02:05:53.701
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4541
02:05:53.701 --> 02:05:55.990
<v Speaker 2>I don't like where I live.</v>

4542
02:05:56.010 --> 02:06:01.010
<v Speaker 2>Sort of feel like people within those communities don't get enough recognition</v>

4543
02:06:01.531 --> 02:06:02.130
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>

4544
02:06:02.130 --> 02:06:03.720
<v Speaker 2>So like which communities,</v>

4545
02:06:04.080 --> 02:06:05.340
<v Speaker 2>so like my,</v>

4546
02:06:05.370 --> 02:06:06.750
<v Speaker 2>let's say my best viewers,</v>

4547
02:06:06.870 --> 02:06:07.920
<v Speaker 2>let's say your best viewers,</v>

4548
02:06:07.921 --> 02:06:09.300
<v Speaker 2>anyone's the best.</v>

4549
02:06:09.330 --> 02:06:10.500
<v Speaker 2>They're all the same to me,</v>

4550
02:06:10.690 --> 02:06:12.510
<v Speaker 2>the fuck out of my awesome people.</v>

4551
02:06:12.540 --> 02:06:13.373
<v Speaker 2>Get it on my face right now.</v>

4552
02:06:13.380 --> 02:06:14.213
<v Speaker 2>How dare you.</v>

4553
02:06:14.280 --> 02:06:15.113
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>

4554
02:06:15.150 --> 02:06:18.540
<v Speaker 2>there are people who are fucking Joe Rogan diehards.</v>

4555
02:06:18.630 --> 02:06:22.590
<v Speaker 2>Those people matter more to you than the hundred thousands,</v>

4556
02:06:22.800 --> 02:06:27.800
<v Speaker 2>100,000 others that are fair weather type viewers.</v>

4557
02:06:28.200 --> 02:06:29.550
<v Speaker 2>They're evangelists for you.</v>

4558
02:06:29.820 --> 02:06:31.470
<v Speaker 2>They're out there saying to their buddies,</v>

4559
02:06:31.560 --> 02:06:32.610
<v Speaker 2>you fucking hear the podcast.</v>

4560
02:06:32.760 --> 02:06:33.870
<v Speaker 2>Go check out the podcast.</v>

4561
02:06:33.900 --> 02:06:35.280
<v Speaker 2>You need to hear this podcast.</v>

4562
02:06:35.490 --> 02:06:37.590
<v Speaker 2>Check out this guest he had on so on and so forth.</v>

4563
02:06:37.591 --> 02:06:38.700
<v Speaker 2>Don't tell them they're important.</v>

4564
02:06:38.701 --> 02:06:41.280
<v Speaker 2>Then they're going to want more attention and then to know what are you doing?</v>

4565
02:06:41.490 --> 02:06:42.420
<v Speaker 2>No locking up everything.</v>

4566
02:06:42.421 --> 02:06:44.400
<v Speaker 2>There's a way that there's a way this can work,</v>

4567
02:06:44.580 --> 02:06:45.690
<v Speaker 2>the way that it can work.</v>

4568
02:06:45.720 --> 02:06:46.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4569
02:06:46.200 --> 02:06:49.400
<v Speaker 2>mushrooms and everybody's got to get on mushrooms together at the same time,</v>

4570
02:06:49.420 --> 02:06:49.740
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

4571
02:06:49.740 --> 02:06:50.610
<v Speaker 2>Here's how it works.</v>

4572
02:06:50.670 --> 02:06:55.670
<v Speaker 2>We need to find a way to reward the most important in our own communities.</v>

4573
02:06:57.090 --> 02:06:57.391
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

4574
02:06:57.391 --> 02:06:58.380
<v Speaker 2>Because here's why.</v>

4575
02:06:59.190 --> 02:07:03.240
<v Speaker 2>It's not fair that they're out there as evangelists for our brands and yet they</v>

4576
02:07:03.241 --> 02:07:04.110
<v Speaker 2>get nothing out of it.</v>

4577
02:07:04.590 --> 02:07:05.610
<v Speaker 2>What are you talking about?</v>

4578
02:07:05.611 --> 02:07:07.380
<v Speaker 2>They get the entertainment out of it.</v>

4579
02:07:07.530 --> 02:07:08.850
<v Speaker 2>That's the whole exchange.</v>

4580
02:07:08.851 --> 02:07:09.684
<v Speaker 2>That's fine.</v>

4581
02:07:09.960 --> 02:07:10.950
<v Speaker 2>Other than the entertainment,</v>

4582
02:07:10.951 --> 02:07:12.420
<v Speaker 2>then it changes and morphs.</v>

4583
02:07:12.450 --> 02:07:14.430
<v Speaker 2>That's fine if they get the entertainment out of it,</v>

4584
02:07:14.850 --> 02:07:17.820
<v Speaker 2>but so to somebody else who shuts the fuck up immediately after they watch it,</v>

4585
02:07:17.910 --> 02:07:21.600
<v Speaker 2>the part they're doing on their own time is not about the entertainment anymore.</v>

4586
02:07:21.630 --> 02:07:21.871
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

4587
02:07:21.871 --> 02:07:22.531
<v Speaker 2>But she don't,</v>

4588
02:07:22.531 --> 02:07:25.100
<v Speaker 2>you do that as well and don't I do that as well and do what he,</v>

4589
02:07:25.200 --> 02:07:27.810
<v Speaker 2>but you talk about things that you enjoy and the,</v>

4590
02:07:27.811 --> 02:07:30.600
<v Speaker 2>the benefit of that is that you support the things that you enjoy.</v>

4591
02:07:30.750 --> 02:07:32.390
<v Speaker 2>Like game of Thrones for instance,</v>

4592
02:07:32.940 --> 02:07:34.320
<v Speaker 2>evangelists of game of Thrones.</v>

4593
02:07:34.440 --> 02:07:35.273
<v Speaker 2>You can't stop talking.</v>

4594
02:07:35.380 --> 02:07:39.070
<v Speaker 2>They've never paid me wouldn't did I say pay?</v>

4595
02:07:39.370 --> 02:07:40.570
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean by reward?</v>

4596
02:07:40.870 --> 02:07:45.430
<v Speaker 2>There are ways to recognize without necessarily paying somebody like who's,</v>

4597
02:07:45.790 --> 02:07:46.630
<v Speaker 2>let's put it this way.</v>

4598
02:07:46.720 --> 02:07:48.400
<v Speaker 2>Who's your most engaged Twitter follower?</v>

4599
02:07:48.401 --> 02:07:49.930
<v Speaker 2>Who Do you talk to more than anyone else?</v>

4600
02:07:50.620 --> 02:07:52.000
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I have a one.</v>

4601
02:07:52.360 --> 02:07:53.490
<v Speaker 2>You probably do know,</v>

4602
02:07:53.560 --> 02:07:54.710
<v Speaker 2>but I'd done saying have one.</v>

4603
02:07:54.760 --> 02:07:55.780
<v Speaker 2>We don't have inaccurate.</v>

4604
02:07:55.820 --> 02:07:57.580
<v Speaker 2>We don't have an accurate way of figuring out.</v>

4605
02:07:57.840 --> 02:07:58.673
<v Speaker 2>I would like,</v>

4606
02:07:58.750 --> 02:08:02.290
<v Speaker 2>you know what would be interesting to me to know who has tweeted at Joe Rogan</v>

4607
02:08:02.320 --> 02:08:05.850
<v Speaker 2>more than any other user going to attract a psych?</v>

4608
02:08:05.910 --> 02:08:07.090
<v Speaker 2>Oh No,</v>

4609
02:08:07.840 --> 02:08:08.673
<v Speaker 2>it's me.</v>

4610
02:08:08.760 --> 02:08:10.990
<v Speaker 2>I am the one I am Highlander.</v>

4611
02:08:12.940 --> 02:08:15.670
<v Speaker 2>You're essentially sending out a bat signal to crazy people.</v>

4612
02:08:15.810 --> 02:08:16.440
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4613
02:08:16.440 --> 02:08:16.580
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

4614
02:08:16.580 --> 02:08:20.020
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going all crazy beyond not because in the real world stuff like this has</v>

4615
02:08:20.021 --> 02:08:21.550
<v Speaker 2>existed for the longest time.</v>

4616
02:08:21.551 --> 02:08:23.660
<v Speaker 2>Like take for example a forum.</v>

4617
02:08:23.990 --> 02:08:25.210
<v Speaker 2>A forum is not in the real world,</v>

4618
02:08:25.211 --> 02:08:27.310
<v Speaker 2>but it's an older platform in a,</v>

4619
02:08:28.030 --> 02:08:28.863
<v Speaker 2>in a forum.</v>

4620
02:08:29.110 --> 02:08:32.050
<v Speaker 2>Game of Thrones sent me a box that counts.</v>

4621
02:08:32.230 --> 02:08:33.250
<v Speaker 2>That fucking counts.</v>

4622
02:08:33.251 --> 02:08:33.821
<v Speaker 2>By the way.</v>

4623
02:08:33.821 --> 02:08:34.654
<v Speaker 2>It's true.</v>

4624
02:08:35.140 --> 02:08:38.620
<v Speaker 2>Well they did that after I talked about them for that fucking counts.</v>

4625
02:08:38.800 --> 02:08:40.240
<v Speaker 2>They didn't just send it just to me either,</v>

4626
02:08:40.241 --> 02:08:40.600
<v Speaker 2>by the way.</v>

4627
02:08:40.600 --> 02:08:41.020
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

4628
02:08:41.020 --> 02:08:41.201
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4629
02:08:41.201 --> 02:08:41.351
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

4630
02:08:41.351 --> 02:08:42.184
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

4631
02:08:42.640 --> 02:08:43.780
<v Speaker 2>But like what are you talking about?</v>

4632
02:08:43.781 --> 02:08:45.820
<v Speaker 2>Like in what way would you reward them?</v>

4633
02:08:46.330 --> 02:08:47.890
<v Speaker 2>So what do you got planned in the old days?</v>

4634
02:08:47.891 --> 02:08:50.560
<v Speaker 2>On a forum forum in the old days,</v>

4635
02:08:50.990 --> 02:08:52.100
<v Speaker 2>but what all did he,</v>

4636
02:08:52.560 --> 02:08:56.830
<v Speaker 2>mine has been around since 1998 I thought I had the oldest form on the net or</v>

4637
02:08:56.831 --> 02:08:58.960
<v Speaker 2>it's one of the oldest forms to me.</v>

4638
02:08:58.990 --> 02:09:00.040
<v Speaker 2>When I get in a forum,</v>

4639
02:09:00.041 --> 02:09:01.390
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I'm in the old internet.</v>

4640
02:09:01.690 --> 02:09:02.170
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

4641
02:09:02.170 --> 02:09:07.170
<v Speaker 2>And the reason is because social media to me has sort of sort of absorbed some</v>

4642
02:09:07.871 --> 02:09:10.810
<v Speaker 2>of what forms are used to be for socializing.</v>

4643
02:09:11.170 --> 02:09:11.501
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

4644
02:09:11.501 --> 02:09:11.860
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

4645
02:09:11.860 --> 02:09:13.420
<v Speaker 2>So I kind of look at social networks.</v>

4646
02:09:13.421 --> 02:09:15.280
<v Speaker 2>It's like forum 2.0 or whatever.</v>

4647
02:09:15.310 --> 02:09:15.880
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

4648
02:09:15.880 --> 02:09:16.510
<v Speaker 2>But Anyway,</v>

4649
02:09:16.510 --> 02:09:18.310
<v Speaker 2>forum still exists and that's cool.</v>

4650
02:09:19.330 --> 02:09:20.170
<v Speaker 2>But on a forum,</v>

4651
02:09:20.440 --> 02:09:22.840
<v Speaker 2>the people who participate like crazy,</v>

4652
02:09:22.990 --> 02:09:24.430
<v Speaker 2>in some forums they have,</v>

4653
02:09:24.520 --> 02:09:26.110
<v Speaker 2>they have like five stars or something,</v>

4654
02:09:26.500 --> 02:09:28.050
<v Speaker 2>or they're a reps,</v>

4655
02:09:28.080 --> 02:09:29.080
<v Speaker 2>a contributor or wrap,</v>

4656
02:09:29.110 --> 02:09:29.943
<v Speaker 2>a moderator,</v>

4657
02:09:31.050 --> 02:09:35.320
<v Speaker 2>Ma like moderators take lots of pride in being moderators,</v>

4658
02:09:35.410 --> 02:09:38.440
<v Speaker 2>even though they're not getting paid to be moderators right now,</v>

4659
02:09:38.441 --> 02:09:39.101
<v Speaker 2>granted,</v>

4660
02:09:39.101 --> 02:09:42.220
<v Speaker 2>you can have circumstances where things get fucking creepy and weird.</v>

4661
02:09:42.680 --> 02:09:43.110
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

4662
02:09:43.110 --> 02:09:43.841
<v Speaker 2>that's going to happen.</v>

4663
02:09:43.841 --> 02:09:45.040
<v Speaker 2>That's inevitably going to happen.</v>

4664
02:09:45.070 --> 02:09:46.060
<v Speaker 2>But for each one of them,</v>

4665
02:09:46.061 --> 02:09:50.170
<v Speaker 2>there's a hundred cool people who want to participate in your community and just</v>

4666
02:09:50.171 --> 02:09:52.990
<v Speaker 2>get a little bit of recognition for that participation.</v>

4667
02:09:53.140 --> 02:09:57.040
<v Speaker 2>I really want to know who has tweeted at unbox therapy therapy more than anyone</v>

4668
02:09:57.041 --> 02:09:57.520
<v Speaker 2>else.</v>

4669
02:09:57.520 --> 02:09:58.690
<v Speaker 2>I wonder who that person is.</v>

4670
02:09:59.380 --> 02:10:00.100
<v Speaker 2>Not because,</v>

4671
02:10:00.100 --> 02:10:01.600
<v Speaker 2>not because I want to stock them,</v>

4672
02:10:01.601 --> 02:10:05.760
<v Speaker 2>but because I want to find a way to thank them for stalking you.</v>

4673
02:10:06.900 --> 02:10:08.350
<v Speaker 2>So you think you're making,</v>

4674
02:10:08.351 --> 02:10:10.690
<v Speaker 2>you're taking the totally negative approach on this.</v>

4675
02:10:10.691 --> 02:10:12.520
<v Speaker 2>I can't help but it's very optimistic.</v>

4676
02:10:12.740 --> 02:10:13.750
<v Speaker 2>Be Optimistic.</v>

4677
02:10:13.751 --> 02:10:16.690
<v Speaker 2>Normally you're the optimistic one right on the podcast and the,</v>

4678
02:10:16.691 --> 02:10:18.760
<v Speaker 2>the person in this seat is the pessimistic one.</v>

4679
02:10:18.790 --> 02:10:19.690
<v Speaker 2>Not necessarily,</v>

4680
02:10:19.870 --> 02:10:24.870
<v Speaker 2>but I think that w I agree in form of what you're saying.</v>

4681
02:10:25.980 --> 02:10:26.260
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4682
02:10:26.260 --> 02:10:27.720
<v Speaker 2>but I think that what the,</v>

4683
02:10:27.750 --> 02:10:31.360
<v Speaker 2>the beauty and the purity of the relationship between someone who likes your</v>

4684
02:10:31.361 --> 02:10:33.680
<v Speaker 2>show and someone comments on your show,</v>

4685
02:10:33.830 --> 02:10:38.830
<v Speaker 2>someone who enjoys you show is that your show gets more recognition,</v>

4686
02:10:38.871 --> 02:10:43.550
<v Speaker 2>more hits and it continues to grow and they get better content because they</v>

4687
02:10:43.551 --> 02:10:44.240
<v Speaker 2>enjoy it,</v>

4688
02:10:44.240 --> 02:10:44.841
<v Speaker 2>they enjoy it,</v>

4689
02:10:44.841 --> 02:10:46.100
<v Speaker 2>it makes their life interesting.</v>

4690
02:10:46.400 --> 02:10:46.761
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4691
02:10:46.761 --> 02:10:49.880
<v Speaker 2>I try as much as possible like when I'm on,</v>

4692
02:10:49.940 --> 02:10:51.080
<v Speaker 2>if you look at my Twitter,</v>

4693
02:10:51.230 --> 02:10:55.550
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that is about my Twitter that's important to me is anything</v>

4694
02:10:55.551 --> 02:10:58.190
<v Speaker 2>that I find that's interesting online I share,</v>

4695
02:10:58.250 --> 02:10:58.520
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4696
02:10:58.520 --> 02:11:03.110
<v Speaker 2>So not everything because he would be as non box therapy on a constant stream.</v>

4697
02:11:03.170 --> 02:11:04.770
<v Speaker 2>I put that I'm just fucking around dairy,</v>

4698
02:11:05.510 --> 02:11:10.510
<v Speaker 2>but it would be a constant stream of videos and content I can't do,</v>

4699
02:11:11.300 --> 02:11:12.170
<v Speaker 2>I can't do everything,</v>

4700
02:11:12.200 --> 02:11:15.950
<v Speaker 2>but things that I think are fascinating like um,</v>

4701
02:11:16.010 --> 02:11:17.240
<v Speaker 2>or important.</v>

4702
02:11:17.241 --> 02:11:17.511
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

4703
02:11:17.511 --> 02:11:17.990
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4704
02:11:17.990 --> 02:11:22.520
<v Speaker 2>I put up something on from science magazine about a widespread contamination of</v>

4705
02:11:22.521 --> 02:11:24.530
<v Speaker 2>the marine environment by microplastics,</v>

4706
02:11:24.531 --> 02:11:28.100
<v Speaker 2>which I think is really a sad and remember of course,</v>

4707
02:11:28.101 --> 02:11:28.271
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

4708
02:11:28.271 --> 02:11:29.104
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4709
02:11:29.180 --> 02:11:32.060
<v Speaker 2>reversible but needs to be addressed.</v>

4710
02:11:32.120 --> 02:11:36.020
<v Speaker 2>Part of our society and the use of plastics in our relationship with the oceans.</v>

4711
02:11:36.170 --> 02:11:37.220
<v Speaker 2>Thinking along those lines,</v>

4712
02:11:37.280 --> 02:11:37.940
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4713
02:11:37.940 --> 02:11:41.960
<v Speaker 2>sexy photos on Facebook may cause women to be seen as less competent.</v>

4714
02:11:42.140 --> 02:11:43.730
<v Speaker 2>That's from the science world report.</v>

4715
02:11:43.760 --> 02:11:44.690
<v Speaker 2>That's another thing that I tweeted.</v>

4716
02:11:45.110 --> 02:11:45.741
<v Speaker 2>Fascinating.</v>

4717
02:11:45.741 --> 02:11:46.031
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

4718
02:11:46.031 --> 02:11:46.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4719
02:11:46.340 --> 02:11:47.000
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>

4720
02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:49.190
<v Speaker 2>So I put a lot of that online.</v>

4721
02:11:49.220 --> 02:11:51.950
<v Speaker 2>So I feel like that is you're adding value for people.</v>

4722
02:11:52.010 --> 02:11:52.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4723
02:11:52.310 --> 02:11:52.850
<v Speaker 2>definitely.</v>

4724
02:11:52.850 --> 02:11:53.683
<v Speaker 2>And it's awesome.</v>

4725
02:11:53.720 --> 02:11:55.580
<v Speaker 2>It gives them an incentive also,</v>

4726
02:11:55.940 --> 02:12:00.620
<v Speaker 2>selfishly to tweet me these interesting things so that I retweet them because I</v>

4727
02:12:00.621 --> 02:12:02.270
<v Speaker 2>do that all the time to followers.</v>

4728
02:12:02.430 --> 02:12:02.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4729
02:12:02.810 --> 02:12:05.120
<v Speaker 2>a lot of followers and recognition and people,</v>

4730
02:12:05.360 --> 02:12:05.541
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4731
02:12:05.541 --> 02:12:05.991
<v Speaker 2>people like,</v>

4732
02:12:05.991 --> 02:12:06.111
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

4733
02:12:06.111 --> 02:12:06.770
<v Speaker 2>that's a perfect,</v>

4734
02:12:06.770 --> 02:12:07.820
<v Speaker 2>that's a perfect example.</v>

4735
02:12:07.821 --> 02:12:08.031
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4736
02:12:08.031 --> 02:12:11.720
<v Speaker 2>that's part of the reason that I love Twitter is that you,</v>

4737
02:12:11.750 --> 02:12:13.220
<v Speaker 2>they know you see them,</v>

4738
02:12:13.790 --> 02:12:15.080
<v Speaker 2>but seeing youtube comments,</v>

4739
02:12:15.140 --> 02:12:15.351
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4740
02:12:15.351 --> 02:12:16.250
<v Speaker 2>you can reply.</v>

4741
02:12:16.251 --> 02:12:17.960
<v Speaker 2>It's impossible to reply to everyone,</v>

4742
02:12:18.380 --> 02:12:20.120
<v Speaker 2>but on Twitter you see one,</v>

4743
02:12:20.121 --> 02:12:21.230
<v Speaker 2>one guy gets retweeted,</v>

4744
02:12:21.231 --> 02:12:21.531
<v Speaker 2>you think,</v>

4745
02:12:21.531 --> 02:12:21.801
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

4746
02:12:21.801 --> 02:12:23.570
<v Speaker 2>I could get retweeted at some point later.</v>

4747
02:12:23.930 --> 02:12:26.990
<v Speaker 2>Something that's been a big conversation lately is the favorite button.</v>

4748
02:12:28.100 --> 02:12:29.300
<v Speaker 2>Are you a fan of the favorite button?</v>

4749
02:12:29.390 --> 02:12:30.200
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4750
02:12:30.200 --> 02:12:31.250
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't make any sense to me.</v>

4751
02:12:31.670 --> 02:12:32.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4752
02:12:32.120 --> 02:12:32.361
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4753
02:12:32.361 --> 02:12:34.160
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't make a lot of sense to a lot of people.</v>

4754
02:12:34.680 --> 02:12:35.990
<v Speaker 2>People use it for different reasons.</v>

4755
02:12:35.991 --> 02:12:37.430
<v Speaker 2>Some people use it to save tweets,</v>

4756
02:12:37.910 --> 02:12:40.460
<v Speaker 2>but that's not the way I use it at all.</v>

4757
02:12:40.700 --> 02:12:42.140
<v Speaker 2>I could care less about saving tweets.</v>

4758
02:12:42.150 --> 02:12:43.820
<v Speaker 2>Most of the time I could use it that way.</v>

4759
02:12:43.821 --> 02:12:46.280
<v Speaker 2>But the majority of how I use it as a recognition piece.</v>

4760
02:12:46.550 --> 02:12:47.960
<v Speaker 2>So you are cool.</v>

4761
02:12:48.170 --> 02:12:49.370
<v Speaker 2>You sent me some cool shit.</v>

4762
02:12:49.400 --> 02:12:50.630
<v Speaker 2>I can't retweet it right now,</v>

4763
02:12:50.660 --> 02:12:51.493
<v Speaker 2>but I see you.</v>

4764
02:12:51.620 --> 02:12:52.340
<v Speaker 2>But why?</v>

4765
02:12:52.340 --> 02:12:53.330
<v Speaker 2>Why can't you retweet it?</v>

4766
02:12:53.420 --> 02:12:57.020
<v Speaker 2>It's just as easy to press retweet and it's just depressing because ultimately</v>

4767
02:12:57.021 --> 02:12:58.220
<v Speaker 2>you need to curate your feed.</v>

4768
02:12:58.340 --> 02:12:59.330
<v Speaker 2>If you retweet everything,</v>

4769
02:12:59.331 --> 02:13:00.170
<v Speaker 2>everyone's ends you,</v>

4770
02:13:00.200 --> 02:13:00.890
<v Speaker 2>you're fucked.</v>

4771
02:13:00.890 --> 02:13:01.580
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

4772
02:13:01.580 --> 02:13:04.550
<v Speaker 2>But if you sit a Cylance feed and favorites,</v>

4773
02:13:04.790 --> 02:13:05.330
<v Speaker 2>no mom,</v>

4774
02:13:05.330 --> 02:13:05.540
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

4775
02:13:05.540 --> 02:13:06.040
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>

4776
02:13:06.040 --> 02:13:07.220
<v Speaker 2>so what I mean no favors.</v>

4777
02:13:07.610 --> 02:13:08.810
<v Speaker 2>Well favorite to do come up,</v>

4778
02:13:08.811 --> 02:13:09.644
<v Speaker 2>but it's kind of,</v>

4779
02:13:09.800 --> 02:13:11.690
<v Speaker 2>you have to go there to get it right.</v>

4780
02:13:11.720 --> 02:13:12.590
<v Speaker 2>Meaning if you favorite,</v>

4781
02:13:12.591 --> 02:13:14.000
<v Speaker 2>something is not going to go on your feet.</v>

4782
02:13:14.060 --> 02:13:14.480
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

4783
02:13:14.480 --> 02:13:17.720
<v Speaker 2>So a favorites are a little tougher to get your hands on.</v>

4784
02:13:17.780 --> 02:13:18.680
<v Speaker 2>I see what you're saying.</v>

4785
02:13:18.681 --> 02:13:21.830
<v Speaker 2>So you're letting someone know that you see them,</v>

4786
02:13:21.831 --> 02:13:23.930
<v Speaker 2>you give them a response by favoriting their tweet,</v>

4787
02:13:24.200 --> 02:13:27.200
<v Speaker 2>but you don't put it on your feed so they can,</v>

4788
02:13:27.201 --> 02:13:28.370
<v Speaker 2>they know that you see them.</v>

4789
02:13:28.410 --> 02:13:28.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4790
02:13:28.630 --> 02:13:29.301
<v Speaker 2>that makes sense.</v>

4791
02:13:29.301 --> 02:13:29.571
<v Speaker 2>Actually.</v>

4792
02:13:29.571 --> 02:13:32.040
<v Speaker 2>That's the best use of it that I've ever heard.</v>

4793
02:13:32.040 --> 02:13:33.180
<v Speaker 5>I do it as a bookmark.</v>

4794
02:13:33.780 --> 02:13:34.613
<v Speaker 5>That's how it was.</v>

4795
02:13:34.680 --> 02:13:35.970
<v Speaker 5>That's what it was intended for.</v>

4796
02:13:36.060 --> 02:13:36.181
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4797
02:13:36.181 --> 02:13:37.050
<v Speaker 5>That's how I've used it.</v>

4798
02:13:37.080 --> 02:13:37.780
<v Speaker 5>That's the only way I've,</v>

4799
02:13:37.780 --> 02:13:40.830
<v Speaker 5>I've intended as a bookmark and there's this growing group of people.</v>

4800
02:13:40.831 --> 02:13:41.521
<v Speaker 5>I don't know how many,</v>

4801
02:13:41.521 --> 02:13:43.410
<v Speaker 5>but when I talk about it on Twitter,</v>

4802
02:13:43.470 --> 02:13:45.180
<v Speaker 5>a lot of people said they're doing the same thing.</v>

4803
02:13:45.480 --> 02:13:49.770
<v Speaker 5>It's a movement to try and generate essentially a like button on Twitter where</v>

4804
02:13:49.771 --> 02:13:50.604
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't exist.</v>

4805
02:13:50.930 --> 02:13:51.231
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

4806
02:13:51.231 --> 02:13:53.690
<v Speaker 1>so the favorite becomes a like button sort of.</v>

4807
02:13:53.780 --> 02:13:54.530
<v Speaker 1>I liked that.</v>

4808
02:13:54.530 --> 02:13:58.850
<v Speaker 1>I liked that because I can actually use that way more because the way I use it</v>

4809
02:13:58.851 --> 02:13:59.030
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

4810
02:13:59.030 --> 02:13:59.863
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

4811
02:14:00.140 --> 02:14:00.973
<v Speaker 1>I just don't,</v>

4812
02:14:00.980 --> 02:14:01.813
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>

4813
02:14:01.820 --> 02:14:02.591
<v Speaker 5>there's no way I can know.</v>

4814
02:14:02.591 --> 02:14:03.880
<v Speaker 5>You can't name that comes my way.</v>

4815
02:14:03.900 --> 02:14:05.480
<v Speaker 5>Even see everything that comes your way.</v>

4816
02:14:05.520 --> 02:14:06.353
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

4817
02:14:06.400 --> 02:14:10.460
<v Speaker 5>but if you're sitting on Twitter and somebody takes the effort to to like they</v>

4818
02:14:10.461 --> 02:14:11.240
<v Speaker 5>thought of you,</v>

4819
02:14:11.240 --> 02:14:12.380
<v Speaker 5>they saw this cool thing,</v>

4820
02:14:12.381 --> 02:14:13.280
<v Speaker 5>they thought of you,</v>

4821
02:14:13.820 --> 02:14:17.390
<v Speaker 5>you hit the star button and it's like there's an exchange.</v>

4822
02:14:17.391 --> 02:14:18.300
<v Speaker 5>There are,</v>

4823
02:14:18.350 --> 02:14:19.490
<v Speaker 5>there is some recognition.</v>

4824
02:14:19.491 --> 02:14:20.750
<v Speaker 5>It's not a dollar value,</v>

4825
02:14:20.960 --> 02:14:22.580
<v Speaker 5>but that's the kind of stuff I'm talking about.</v>

4826
02:14:22.980 --> 02:14:24.710
<v Speaker 5>I'm talking about nurturing a community.</v>

4827
02:14:25.230 --> 02:14:25.980
<v Speaker 1>That makes sense.</v>

4828
02:14:25.980 --> 02:14:26.970
<v Speaker 1>That totally makes sense.</v>

4829
02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:27.661
<v Speaker 1>And then that,</v>

4830
02:14:27.661 --> 02:14:28.180
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4831
02:14:28.180 --> 02:14:33.180
<v Speaker 1>I think nurturing and community also comes from being engaged from reading your</v>

4832
02:14:34.171 --> 02:14:37.750
<v Speaker 1>comments and maybe commenting on them in another podcast or another,</v>

4833
02:14:37.751 --> 02:14:38.820
<v Speaker 1>a video cast,</v>

4834
02:14:38.821 --> 02:14:39.900
<v Speaker 1>whatever you would like to call it.</v>

4835
02:14:40.170 --> 02:14:40.980
<v Speaker 1>Or um,</v>

4836
02:14:40.980 --> 02:14:41.813
<v Speaker 1>Twitter,</v>

4837
02:14:41.850 --> 02:14:42.121
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4838
02:14:42.121 --> 02:14:44.490
<v Speaker 1>engaging with people as much as possible,</v>

4839
02:14:44.491 --> 02:14:46.590
<v Speaker 1>answering questions as much as possible.</v>

4840
02:14:46.591 --> 02:14:48.300
<v Speaker 1>But with me,</v>

4841
02:14:48.330 --> 02:14:52.860
<v Speaker 1>there's a certain balance of engaging and still getting work done.</v>

4842
02:14:52.861 --> 02:14:53.700
<v Speaker 1>Like my,</v>

4843
02:14:54.330 --> 02:14:56.790
<v Speaker 1>my thing is all about producing content.</v>

4844
02:14:57.300 --> 02:14:57.871
<v Speaker 1>I produce,</v>

4845
02:14:57.871 --> 02:14:58.410
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

4846
02:14:58.410 --> 02:14:59.700
<v Speaker 1>Hours of a podcast.</v>

4847
02:14:59.701 --> 02:15:00.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4848
02:15:00.180 --> 02:15:01.440
<v Speaker 1>three days a week,</v>

4849
02:15:01.441 --> 02:15:02.251
<v Speaker 1>most of the time.</v>

4850
02:15:02.251 --> 02:15:06.570
<v Speaker 1>And then there's the writing of comedy and have random thoughts that that have</v>

4851
02:15:06.571 --> 02:15:07.404
<v Speaker 1>to take place.</v>

4852
02:15:07.620 --> 02:15:08.790
<v Speaker 1>If it doesn't take place,</v>

4853
02:15:09.030 --> 02:15:10.200
<v Speaker 1>my common you'll suffer.</v>

4854
02:15:10.680 --> 02:15:14.280
<v Speaker 1>And probably my conversations that I have on podcasts will suffer.</v>

4855
02:15:14.281 --> 02:15:19.281
<v Speaker 1>I need to think about ideas by myself as well as have them in a conversation</v>

4856
02:15:19.651 --> 02:15:20.400
<v Speaker 1>with people.</v>

4857
02:15:20.400 --> 02:15:22.890
<v Speaker 1>And then there's also the researching of Shit,</v>

4858
02:15:22.891 --> 02:15:24.270
<v Speaker 1>the reading of articles,</v>

4859
02:15:24.271 --> 02:15:25.830
<v Speaker 1>the watching of documentaries,</v>

4860
02:15:25.831 --> 02:15:27.660
<v Speaker 1>the reading of magazines or books.</v>

4861
02:15:28.140 --> 02:15:33.140
<v Speaker 1>The amount of time that's leftover to just engage with people online is pretty</v>

4862
02:15:33.361 --> 02:15:33.810
<v Speaker 1>minimal.</v>

4863
02:15:33.810 --> 02:15:35.880
<v Speaker 1>And if you change the balance in any way,</v>

4864
02:15:36.330 --> 02:15:38.310
<v Speaker 1>all the content that you put out suffers.</v>

4865
02:15:38.370 --> 02:15:38.700
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4866
02:15:38.700 --> 02:15:42.180
<v Speaker 5>And I think it's easy to forget that the content in and of itself is a</v>

4867
02:15:42.181 --> 02:15:42.990
<v Speaker 5>communication.</v>

4868
02:15:42.990 --> 02:15:43.500
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

4869
02:15:43.500 --> 02:15:45.000
<v Speaker 5>Meaning that like it's,</v>

4870
02:15:45.080 --> 02:15:47.340
<v Speaker 5>it's similar to what I said before about the best buy thing.</v>

4871
02:15:47.370 --> 02:15:51.210
<v Speaker 5>How essentially we took a traditional model of this guy in his best buy store</v>

4872
02:15:51.270 --> 02:15:55.710
<v Speaker 5>and we said this is much more dynamic and it's much more streamlined to take one</v>

4873
02:15:55.711 --> 02:15:57.230
<v Speaker 5>guy who really knows and give that to everyone.</v>

4874
02:15:57.231 --> 02:15:57.360
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

4875
02:15:57.360 --> 02:16:02.360
<v Speaker 5>video is this way of having one message suitable or sent to hundreds,</v>

4876
02:16:03.960 --> 02:16:03.960
<v Speaker 5>thousands,</v>

4877
02:16:03.960 --> 02:16:04.793
<v Speaker 5>millions of people.</v>

4878
02:16:04.920 --> 02:16:06.900
<v Speaker 5>Whereas it's a personalized tweet.</v>

4879
02:16:06.930 --> 02:16:07.763
<v Speaker 5>I'm sorry.</v>

4880
02:16:07.980 --> 02:16:10.830
<v Speaker 5>If you were to sit there all day and answer every tweet you ever got,</v>

4881
02:16:10.831 --> 02:16:12.360
<v Speaker 5>you'd never make another thing in your life.</v>

4882
02:16:12.480 --> 02:16:13.080
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>

4883
02:16:13.080 --> 02:16:16.200
<v Speaker 5>And ultimately the reason people care about you in the first place is because of</v>

4884
02:16:16.201 --> 02:16:17.250
<v Speaker 5>all the cool shit you made.</v>

4885
02:16:17.610 --> 02:16:17.791
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

4886
02:16:17.791 --> 02:16:18.624
<v Speaker 5>there's a balance.</v>

4887
02:16:18.700 --> 02:16:19.320
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

4888
02:16:19.320 --> 02:16:19.521
<v Speaker 1>it's an,</v>

4889
02:16:19.521 --> 02:16:20.220
<v Speaker 1>it may be,</v>

4890
02:16:20.220 --> 02:16:20.670
<v Speaker 1>who knows?</v>

4891
02:16:20.670 --> 02:16:24.060
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's like a weekly asked me anything sort of a thing like they do on</v>

4892
02:16:24.061 --> 02:16:24.894
<v Speaker 1>reddit.</v>

4893
02:16:24.920 --> 02:16:25.221
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah,</v>

4894
02:16:25.221 --> 02:16:25.810
<v Speaker 5>he's read it.</v>

4895
02:16:25.810 --> 02:16:26.601
<v Speaker 5>Definitely kind of fun.</v>

4896
02:16:26.601 --> 02:16:27.860
<v Speaker 5>Some of the guys that we had with us,</v>

4897
02:16:28.190 --> 02:16:31.660
<v Speaker 5>big proponents of asking me videos as well and you just,</v>

4898
02:16:31.690 --> 02:16:35.740
<v Speaker 5>you get thousands of questions and on Twitter and you pick a few and addressing.</v>

4899
02:16:35.800 --> 02:16:36.633
<v Speaker 5>It's huge.</v>

4900
02:16:36.640 --> 02:16:36.851
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4901
02:16:36.851 --> 02:16:40.510
<v Speaker 1>And I think that might be a better way to do it even because writing things like</v>

4902
02:16:40.511 --> 02:16:42.850
<v Speaker 1>one of the issues that I have with blog entries,</v>

4903
02:16:42.851 --> 02:16:44.860
<v Speaker 1>and I do enjoy reading people's blogs,</v>

4904
02:16:44.861 --> 02:16:46.600
<v Speaker 1>but one of the issues that I have is that you,</v>

4905
02:16:46.630 --> 02:16:50.440
<v Speaker 1>if you give someone a free,</v>

4906
02:16:50.770 --> 02:16:51.041
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4907
02:16:51.041 --> 02:16:56.041
<v Speaker 1>a page where it's just an open platform to write things and to write about a</v>

4908
02:16:56.351 --> 02:16:56.801
<v Speaker 1>subject,</v>

4909
02:16:56.801 --> 02:16:58.030
<v Speaker 1>they're not opposed,</v>

4910
02:16:58.300 --> 02:16:58.571
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4911
02:16:58.571 --> 02:17:01.030
<v Speaker 1>it's just their thoughts and it's a way to express thoughts.</v>

4912
02:17:01.210 --> 02:17:03.490
<v Speaker 1>But they might be saying some incorrect,</v>

4913
02:17:03.760 --> 02:17:08.350
<v Speaker 1>incorrect and not factual shit or distorted shit.</v>

4914
02:17:08.590 --> 02:17:13.590
<v Speaker 1>And they use that as the base for other statements and they use that as a base</v>

4915
02:17:13.601 --> 02:17:17.170
<v Speaker 1>to further expand upon these thoughts that were based almost entirely on</v>

4916
02:17:17.171 --> 02:17:20.170
<v Speaker 1>something incorrect in the first place or distorted in the first place were</v>

4917
02:17:20.350 --> 02:17:21.490
<v Speaker 1>biased in the first place.</v>

4918
02:17:21.700 --> 02:17:25.360
<v Speaker 1>So it creates this piece like say if someone was writing something about you,</v>

4919
02:17:25.540 --> 02:17:28.630
<v Speaker 1>like a really bias piece about Lewis from unbox helping.</v>

4920
02:17:28.660 --> 02:17:29.630
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for giving him the idea.</v>

4921
02:17:29.631 --> 02:17:30.430
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

4922
02:17:30.430 --> 02:17:35.140
<v Speaker 1>They did do that and a lot of it was based on some incorrect assumptions about</v>

4923
02:17:35.141 --> 02:17:39.430
<v Speaker 1>you as some incorrect information or distorted perception probably exists.</v>

4924
02:17:39.760 --> 02:17:39.970
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

4925
02:17:39.970 --> 02:17:40.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure it does.</v>

4926
02:17:40.660 --> 02:17:44.860
<v Speaker 1>But my point being that that's a really bad way to communicate ideas.</v>

4927
02:17:44.861 --> 02:17:47.710
<v Speaker 1>It's good for just trying to shame someone or trying to,</v>

4928
02:17:47.910 --> 02:17:48.240
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4929
02:17:48.240 --> 02:17:48.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4930
02:17:48.550 --> 02:17:50.920
<v Speaker 1>just throw mud on their name,</v>

4931
02:17:51.130 --> 02:17:51.490
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

4932
02:17:51.490 --> 02:17:55.390
<v Speaker 1>or to pray someone or to pump someone up and create them,</v>

4933
02:17:55.750 --> 02:17:56.920
<v Speaker 1>create some art.</v>

4934
02:17:56.980 --> 02:18:01.980
<v Speaker 1>But the best way to express an idea is to have that idea sort of vetted out with</v>

4935
02:18:03.851 --> 02:18:04.590
<v Speaker 1>another person.</v>

4936
02:18:04.590 --> 02:18:05.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4937
02:18:05.110 --> 02:18:05.411
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4938
02:18:05.411 --> 02:18:05.701
<v Speaker 1>and that,</v>

4939
02:18:05.701 --> 02:18:06.590
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't really,</v>

4940
02:18:06.591 --> 02:18:06.860
<v Speaker 1>that I,</v>

4941
02:18:06.860 --> 02:18:09.280
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't really happen when you do it in that form.</v>

4942
02:18:09.310 --> 02:18:10.143
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

4943
02:18:10.200 --> 02:18:10.630
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4944
02:18:10.630 --> 02:18:10.920
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

4945
02:18:10.920 --> 02:18:13.140
<v Speaker 5>and another thing too,</v>

4946
02:18:13.190 --> 02:18:13.440
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

4947
02:18:13.440 --> 02:18:18.440
<v Speaker 5>well building on that is the fact that video in and of itself is the closest</v>

4948
02:18:18.871 --> 02:18:22.200
<v Speaker 5>thing we have to real life to actually meeting somebody.</v>

4949
02:18:22.201 --> 02:18:22.621
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

4950
02:18:22.621 --> 02:18:23.454
<v Speaker 5>So you can,</v>

4951
02:18:23.760 --> 02:18:24.593
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4952
02:18:25.080 --> 02:18:29.130
<v Speaker 5>you can take all of those things that are happening within communication that</v>

4953
02:18:29.131 --> 02:18:33.930
<v Speaker 5>aren't necessarily the words themselves and you can put those into the overall</v>

4954
02:18:34.170 --> 02:18:38.430
<v Speaker 5>sort of scenario and the line that you're going to draw based on their</v>

4955
02:18:38.431 --> 02:18:39.150
<v Speaker 5>perspective.</v>

4956
02:18:39.150 --> 02:18:40.710
<v Speaker 5>You guys were talking recently about,</v>

4957
02:18:40.980 --> 02:18:41.460
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4958
02:18:41.460 --> 02:18:46.460
<v Speaker 5>your buddy on Twitter who had the radio show and said some stuff and then got</v>

4959
02:18:46.861 --> 02:18:49.720
<v Speaker 5>kicked off the radio show and yeah.</v>

4960
02:18:50.550 --> 02:18:51.600
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>

4961
02:18:51.601 --> 02:18:55.950
<v Speaker 5>con to how context in so many ways dictates interpretation.</v>

4962
02:18:56.550 --> 02:18:59.180
<v Speaker 5>So if video is the best right videos,</v>

4963
02:18:59.190 --> 02:19:03.780
<v Speaker 5>this modern form of communication and writing his fucking super old,</v>

4964
02:19:05.310 --> 02:19:06.270
<v Speaker 5>you look at the,</v>

4965
02:19:06.320 --> 02:19:06.780
<v Speaker 5>you will,</v>

4966
02:19:06.780 --> 02:19:07.470
<v Speaker 5>first of all,</v>

4967
02:19:07.470 --> 02:19:08.430
<v Speaker 5>one of them is way better.</v>

4968
02:19:08.431 --> 02:19:10.350
<v Speaker 5>But look at the reason why writing was invented.</v>

4969
02:19:10.351 --> 02:19:11.900
<v Speaker 5>Writing was invented because he didn't have,</v>

4970
02:19:11.960 --> 02:19:12.160
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

4971
02:19:12.160 --> 02:19:13.800
<v Speaker 5>I wonder what was your alternative?</v>

4972
02:19:14.010 --> 02:19:14.191
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4973
02:19:14.191 --> 02:19:15.750
<v Speaker 1>But I don't think it's way better.</v>

4974
02:19:15.960 --> 02:19:16.350
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4975
02:19:16.350 --> 02:19:20.430
<v Speaker 1>because I think writing's has its place definitely for some things,</v>

4976
02:19:20.550 --> 02:19:20.650
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

4977
02:19:20.650 --> 02:19:21.000
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4978
02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:21.930
<v Speaker 5>I don't think I agree with you.</v>

4979
02:19:21.931 --> 02:19:23.280
<v Speaker 5>I don't think it's a question of better or worse.</v>

4980
02:19:23.340 --> 02:19:25.140
<v Speaker 5>But look what television did to newspapers.</v>

4981
02:19:25.760 --> 02:19:26.593
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4982
02:19:26.930 --> 02:19:28.220
<v Speaker 5>Or the web did to newspapers,</v>

4983
02:19:28.221 --> 02:19:28.790
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

4984
02:19:28.790 --> 02:19:30.200
<v Speaker 5>So it's one,</v>

4985
02:19:30.230 --> 02:19:32.340
<v Speaker 5>it's not better or worse or it's,</v>

4986
02:19:32.360 --> 02:19:34.490
<v Speaker 5>maybe it's the comic book discussion all over again.</v>

4987
02:19:34.940 --> 02:19:36.110
<v Speaker 5>Something will win out.</v>

4988
02:19:36.650 --> 02:19:37.520
<v Speaker 5>It will happen.</v>

4989
02:19:37.760 --> 02:19:39.500
<v Speaker 5>It is TV better for people.</v>

4990
02:19:39.501 --> 02:19:40.340
<v Speaker 5>The newspapers,</v>

4991
02:19:41.150 --> 02:19:42.230
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't really matter anymore.</v>

4992
02:19:42.231 --> 02:19:44.210
<v Speaker 5>It's a moot point because people chose TV.</v>

4993
02:19:44.540 --> 02:19:44.871
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

4994
02:19:44.871 --> 02:19:46.520
<v Speaker 5>But that's just because it's passive.</v>

4995
02:19:46.550 --> 02:19:47.360
<v Speaker 5>He just sit there.</v>

4996
02:19:47.360 --> 02:19:48.193
<v Speaker 5>That's right.</v>

4997
02:19:48.260 --> 02:19:50.990
<v Speaker 5>And it just comes to you when given the choice between video.</v>

4998
02:19:51.020 --> 02:19:52.760
<v Speaker 5>Here's something that Google's testing is,</v>

4999
02:19:52.761 --> 02:19:55.790
<v Speaker 5>instead of giving you text based search results on a Google search,</v>

5000
02:19:55.791 --> 02:19:56.960
<v Speaker 5>they give you video results.</v>

5001
02:19:57.380 --> 02:19:57.920
<v Speaker 5>They give you,</v>

5002
02:19:57.920 --> 02:20:01.760
<v Speaker 5>you can you Google something and there's a video option for Google to serve up.</v>

5003
02:20:01.920 --> 02:20:02.690
<v Speaker 5>They'll grab it.</v>

5004
02:20:02.690 --> 02:20:05.150
<v Speaker 5>That's a lot of my traffic comes from Google search,</v>

5005
02:20:05.151 --> 02:20:06.260
<v Speaker 5>not youtube searches.</v>

5006
02:20:06.860 --> 02:20:11.860
<v Speaker 5>So Google knows that their objective is to answer your question in the way that</v>

5007
02:20:12.711 --> 02:20:13.790
<v Speaker 5>you want to have it answered.</v>

5008
02:20:14.450 --> 02:20:15.350
<v Speaker 5>That makes sense,</v>

5009
02:20:15.510 --> 02:20:15.860
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

5010
02:20:15.860 --> 02:20:16.191
<v Speaker 5>The bet.</v>

5011
02:20:16.191 --> 02:20:18.230
<v Speaker 5>The most suitable format for you to ingest.</v>

5012
02:20:18.500 --> 02:20:22.640
<v Speaker 5>And oftentimes that means video because retention times are better on video.</v>

5013
02:20:22.641 --> 02:20:23.474
<v Speaker 5>People,</v>

5014
02:20:23.930 --> 02:20:25.430
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to say are lazy people,</v>

5015
02:20:25.431 --> 02:20:29.900
<v Speaker 5>just like sophisticated delivery models or like documentaries for me are an</v>

5016
02:20:29.901 --> 02:20:31.010
<v Speaker 5>amazing way to learn.</v>

5017
02:20:31.370 --> 02:20:31.551
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

5018
02:20:31.551 --> 02:20:36.230
<v Speaker 5>it's also you can't hide when if someone writes something in print,</v>

5019
02:20:36.530 --> 02:20:37.700
<v Speaker 5>but they're full of shit.</v>

5020
02:20:38.300 --> 02:20:39.133
<v Speaker 5>It's hard.</v>

5021
02:20:39.170 --> 02:20:39.551
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

5022
02:20:39.551 --> 02:20:42.320
<v Speaker 5>It's hard to see that posing less about themselves.</v>

5023
02:20:42.321 --> 02:20:44.270
<v Speaker 5>How much would you like if you ever read,</v>

5024
02:20:44.271 --> 02:20:47.090
<v Speaker 5>like you ever read a really crazy tumbler site,</v>

5025
02:20:47.120 --> 02:20:47.660
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

5026
02:20:47.660 --> 02:20:48.020
<v Speaker 5>And you're like,</v>

5027
02:20:48.020 --> 02:20:48.411
<v Speaker 5>oh my God,</v>

5028
02:20:48.411 --> 02:20:50.630
<v Speaker 5>I would so much rather hear you say this.</v>

5029
02:20:51.080 --> 02:20:51.650
<v Speaker 5>You know like,</v>

5030
02:20:51.650 --> 02:20:51.791
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

5031
02:20:51.791 --> 02:20:56.791
<v Speaker 5>like some crazy radical feminists ranting anti male ran to.</v>

5032
02:20:57.130 --> 02:21:00.410
<v Speaker 5>Here's the thing about that too is when you write something,</v>

5033
02:21:00.980 --> 02:21:01.490
<v Speaker 5>it's not,</v>

5034
02:21:01.490 --> 02:21:03.740
<v Speaker 5>it's nothing like plastering your face on something.</v>

5035
02:21:04.370 --> 02:21:07.580
<v Speaker 5>I think these people wouldn't say half the shit they said if it was their face</v>

5036
02:21:07.581 --> 02:21:08.960
<v Speaker 5>in front of every most likely.</v>

5037
02:21:09.080 --> 02:21:09.530
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

5038
02:21:09.530 --> 02:21:12.800
<v Speaker 5>And so if you would expose the craziness would come out of it,</v>

5039
02:21:12.801 --> 02:21:13.634
<v Speaker 5>you would see it.</v>

5040
02:21:13.670 --> 02:21:13.970
<v Speaker 5>He goes,</v>

5041
02:21:13.970 --> 02:21:14.660
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

5042
02:21:14.660 --> 02:21:16.170
<v Speaker 5>you're a fucking banana.</v>

5043
02:21:16.280 --> 02:21:16.611
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

5044
02:21:16.611 --> 02:21:17.260
<v Speaker 5>sorry,</v>

5045
02:21:17.260 --> 02:21:17.501
<v Speaker 5>I need,</v>

5046
02:21:17.501 --> 02:21:18.680
<v Speaker 5>I can stop watching this now.</v>

5047
02:21:18.681 --> 02:21:23.660
<v Speaker 5>Now I know what I'm dealing with or I can watch this with a more level</v>

5048
02:21:23.661 --> 02:21:24.350
<v Speaker 5>perspective.</v>

5049
02:21:24.350 --> 02:21:25.970
<v Speaker 5>That's why I'm saying that's what I'm saying.</v>

5050
02:21:25.971 --> 02:21:26.900
<v Speaker 5>Video is the ultimate,</v>

5051
02:21:27.260 --> 02:21:28.970
<v Speaker 5>the ultimate in terms of bits and bytes.</v>

5052
02:21:29.390 --> 02:21:30.620
<v Speaker 5>Think about the information.</v>

5053
02:21:30.810 --> 02:21:32.720
<v Speaker 5>I write down on a bunch of shit on his notepad.</v>

5054
02:21:33.020 --> 02:21:34.670
<v Speaker 5>If I were to put that into bits and bytes,</v>

5055
02:21:34.671 --> 02:21:36.530
<v Speaker 5>take a photograph or type it out.</v>

5056
02:21:36.830 --> 02:21:40.520
<v Speaker 5>That's nothing at and can SMS message in terms of size is not,</v>

5057
02:21:40.550 --> 02:21:41.910
<v Speaker 5>there's not very much data there.</v>

5058
02:21:41.950 --> 02:21:43.180
<v Speaker 5>You know it's true.</v>

5059
02:21:43.510 --> 02:21:44.000
<v Speaker 5>If I want.</v>

5060
02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:45.470
<v Speaker 5>That's what held the web back.</v>

5061
02:21:45.500 --> 02:21:46.700
<v Speaker 5>That's why newspapers exist.</v>

5062
02:21:46.701 --> 02:21:48.140
<v Speaker 5>That's why we had to send each other letters.</v>

5063
02:21:48.260 --> 02:21:49.700
<v Speaker 5>We didn't have the bandwidth.</v>

5064
02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:51.180
<v Speaker 5>Ah,</v>

5065
02:21:51.260 --> 02:21:52.610
<v Speaker 5>now that we have the bandwidth,</v>

5066
02:21:52.611 --> 02:21:54.770
<v Speaker 5>we can transport ourselves.</v>

5067
02:21:54.800 --> 02:21:59.270
<v Speaker 5>The closest thing we can get to it across the other way and so we have to stand</v>

5068
02:21:59.271 --> 02:22:01.370
<v Speaker 5>up for the shit that we actually believe in.</v>

5069
02:22:01.490 --> 02:22:02.810
<v Speaker 5>We have to be authentic.</v>

5070
02:22:02.811 --> 02:22:06.800
<v Speaker 5>We have to all these other things immediately fall into line because it's so</v>

5071
02:22:06.801 --> 02:22:10.100
<v Speaker 5>much harder to fake when you have access to all that extra data.</v>

5072
02:22:10.430 --> 02:22:15.430
<v Speaker 5>Well then how come like a sort of 15 second thing on on Twitter hasn't taken off</v>

5073
02:22:18.291 --> 02:22:20.210
<v Speaker 5>like 140 character thing.</v>

5074
02:22:20.600 --> 02:22:22.790
<v Speaker 5>Like a 15 second video thing.</v>

5075
02:22:22.820 --> 02:22:23.061
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

5076
02:22:23.061 --> 02:22:24.170
<v Speaker 5>like fine and shit.</v>

5077
02:22:24.200 --> 02:22:24.830
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

5078
02:22:24.830 --> 02:22:25.663
<v Speaker 5>like</v>

5079
02:22:26.000 --> 02:22:27.600
<v Speaker 1>kind of silly.</v>

5080
02:22:27.650 --> 02:22:28.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5081
02:22:28.020 --> 02:22:29.220
<v Speaker 1>Instagram is pretty big though.</v>

5082
02:22:29.250 --> 02:22:29.581
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5083
02:22:29.581 --> 02:22:29.851
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

5084
02:22:29.851 --> 02:22:30.271
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>

5085
02:22:30.271 --> 02:22:32.220
<v Speaker 1>how many people express themselves on it?</v>

5086
02:22:32.400 --> 02:22:35.670
<v Speaker 1>They have videos where they do things like they'll skip forward jump Wu or</v>

5087
02:22:35.671 --> 02:22:37.350
<v Speaker 1>they'll fucking ride a motorcycle.</v>

5088
02:22:37.351 --> 02:22:38.184
<v Speaker 1>Woo.</v>

5089
02:22:38.250 --> 02:22:38.491
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

5090
02:22:38.491 --> 02:22:39.271
<v Speaker 1>they'll have that.</v>

5091
02:22:39.271 --> 02:22:43.890
<v Speaker 1>But how many of them are of people staring at the camera and saying something</v>

5092
02:22:43.891 --> 02:22:44.910
<v Speaker 1>for 140 care,</v>

5093
02:22:44.970 --> 02:22:46.170
<v Speaker 1>440 characters.</v>

5094
02:22:46.200 --> 02:22:46.620
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

5095
02:22:46.620 --> 02:22:47.640
<v Speaker 1>here's a huge community.</v>

5096
02:22:47.641 --> 02:22:49.290
<v Speaker 1>I mean Instagram taking a Manga.</v>

5097
02:22:49.320 --> 02:22:49.860
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

5098
02:22:49.860 --> 02:22:51.930
<v Speaker 1>but then Instagram is mostly pictures,</v>

5099
02:22:52.170 --> 02:22:54.480
<v Speaker 1>mostly pictures with context underneath it.</v>

5100
02:22:54.690 --> 02:22:55.380
<v Speaker 1>How many?</v>

5101
02:22:55.380 --> 02:22:55.780
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

5102
02:22:55.780 --> 02:22:58.380
<v Speaker 1>What if we're talking about the purest expression,</v>

5103
02:22:58.410 --> 02:23:01.440
<v Speaker 1>the closest thing you can get to an actual person for the actual video like</v>

5104
02:23:01.441 --> 02:23:01.830
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

5105
02:23:01.830 --> 02:23:03.390
<v Speaker 1>why isn't that taking off?</v>

5106
02:23:03.460 --> 02:23:05.670
<v Speaker 1>Whereas a pure video communication,</v>

5107
02:23:05.730 --> 02:23:08.880
<v Speaker 1>youtube vine be up at 15 seconds.</v>

5108
02:23:09.060 --> 02:23:09.370
<v Speaker 1>Why does,</v>

5109
02:23:09.370 --> 02:23:09.830
<v Speaker 1>why do you care?</v>

5110
02:23:09.830 --> 02:23:11.720
<v Speaker 1>Why do you want it to be 15 yeah,</v>

5111
02:23:11.721 --> 02:23:12.420
<v Speaker 1>that's what I know it.</v>

5112
02:23:12.420 --> 02:23:13.253
<v Speaker 1>That's fine.</v>

5113
02:23:13.740 --> 02:23:18.000
<v Speaker 1>But I know that because of like one of the things that made Twitter stand out.</v>

5114
02:23:18.120 --> 02:23:19.160
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

5115
02:23:19.170 --> 02:23:21.240
<v Speaker 1>40 courses concision I see what you're saying.</v>

5116
02:23:21.500 --> 02:23:21.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5117
02:23:21.820 --> 02:23:23.850
<v Speaker 1>So can we force concision with video?</v>

5118
02:23:26.690 --> 02:23:27.160
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

5119
02:23:27.160 --> 02:23:27.820
<v Speaker 5>Is that possible?</v>

5120
02:23:27.820 --> 02:23:29.620
<v Speaker 5>What we're talking about ultimate expression,</v>

5121
02:23:29.800 --> 02:23:30.633
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

5122
02:23:30.730 --> 02:23:35.730
<v Speaker 5>The ultimate experience of somebody and who they are and what they are.</v>

5123
02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:38.530
<v Speaker 5>What you do over here,</v>

5124
02:23:40.350 --> 02:23:41.310
<v Speaker 5>three hours you kick me.</v>

5125
02:23:41.620 --> 02:23:45.300
<v Speaker 5>If we're agreeing that it's all about faking it or not faking it,</v>

5126
02:23:46.290 --> 02:23:50.160
<v Speaker 5>it's only going to get astronomically harder the longer you have to hold it up.</v>

5127
02:23:50.360 --> 02:23:51.193
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

5128
02:23:51.200 --> 02:23:51.981
<v Speaker 1>I agree with that,</v>

5129
02:23:51.981 --> 02:23:54.040
<v Speaker 1>but what I'm saying is a takeout that I,</v>

5130
02:23:54.041 --> 02:23:55.970
<v Speaker 1>I definitely agree that to get a cross,</v>

5131
02:23:55.971 --> 02:23:57.920
<v Speaker 1>a more elaborate point of view,</v>

5132
02:23:57.960 --> 02:23:58.290
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

5133
02:23:58.290 --> 02:23:59.450
<v Speaker 1>Discuss something in depth.</v>

5134
02:23:59.630 --> 02:24:01.010
<v Speaker 1>You would want a youtube video.</v>

5135
02:24:01.020 --> 02:24:02.240
<v Speaker 1>That's the benefit of youtube,</v>

5136
02:24:02.540 --> 02:24:07.540
<v Speaker 1>but like what about a something where I guess a lot of Twitter is a sharing of</v>

5137
02:24:08.121 --> 02:24:08.421
<v Speaker 1>links,</v>

5138
02:24:08.421 --> 02:24:09.740
<v Speaker 1>but take away the sharing of links.</v>

5139
02:24:09.980 --> 02:24:11.840
<v Speaker 1>What's your new Captain American movie today?</v>

5140
02:24:11.900 --> 02:24:12.681
<v Speaker 1>All my God,</v>

5141
02:24:12.681 --> 02:24:14.710
<v Speaker 1>did it suck a fat Dick gone.</v>

5142
02:24:14.870 --> 02:24:15.380
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

5143
02:24:15.380 --> 02:24:16.213
<v Speaker 1>Vine.</v>

5144
02:24:16.490 --> 02:24:17.870
<v Speaker 1>But do they use it for that?</v>

5145
02:24:18.030 --> 02:24:18.630
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

5146
02:24:18.630 --> 02:24:19.680
<v Speaker 5>People use it for that.</v>

5147
02:24:19.980 --> 02:24:21.840
<v Speaker 5>Most of vine is like comedy stuff.</v>

5148
02:24:22.200 --> 02:24:24.510
<v Speaker 5>The vast majority people joking around,</v>

5149
02:24:24.600 --> 02:24:26.400
<v Speaker 5>little tiny seven second skits.</v>

5150
02:24:26.430 --> 02:24:26.940
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

5151
02:24:26.940 --> 02:24:30.210
<v Speaker 5>Like some of the popular ones that I've recognized is this thing where people</v>

5152
02:24:30.211 --> 02:24:31.620
<v Speaker 5>really like Jordan shoes.</v>

5153
02:24:31.970 --> 02:24:32.310
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>

5154
02:24:32.310 --> 02:24:36.570
<v Speaker 5>you probably maybe saw this past around where if a guy's really into sneakers,</v>

5155
02:24:36.690 --> 02:24:36.910
<v Speaker 5>he,</v>

5156
02:24:36.910 --> 02:24:39.150
<v Speaker 5>if he gets us a little mark on his Jordans,</v>

5157
02:24:39.151 --> 02:24:39.984
<v Speaker 5>he freaks out,</v>

5158
02:24:40.110 --> 02:24:40.381
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5159
02:24:40.381 --> 02:24:43.290
<v Speaker 5>that kind of paradigm or that kind of whatever,</v>

5160
02:24:43.350 --> 02:24:44.183
<v Speaker 5>whatever that is.</v>

5161
02:24:44.520 --> 02:24:45.600
<v Speaker 5>So that's like a thing.</v>

5162
02:24:45.750 --> 02:24:47.150
<v Speaker 5>But on vine there's,</v>

5163
02:24:47.151 --> 02:24:49.350
<v Speaker 5>there's some channels that are dedicated to that.</v>

5164
02:24:49.380 --> 02:24:50.213
<v Speaker 5>Like what I would do,</v>

5165
02:24:50.440 --> 02:24:51.540
<v Speaker 5>I don't know really,</v>

5166
02:24:51.570 --> 02:24:52.081
<v Speaker 5>but funny,</v>

5167
02:24:52.081 --> 02:24:52.741
<v Speaker 5>in a funny way,</v>

5168
02:24:52.741 --> 02:24:53.574
<v Speaker 5>whatever is skit,</v>

5169
02:24:53.580 --> 02:24:55.270
<v Speaker 5>I'm doing a terrible job of describing it.</v>

5170
02:24:55.271 --> 02:24:56.310
<v Speaker 5>You use vine all the time.</v>

5171
02:24:56.311 --> 02:25:00.420
<v Speaker 5>Like I was pretty much reviewing Spiderman three when I was watching it using</v>

5172
02:25:00.421 --> 02:25:03.700
<v Speaker 5>vine and Instagram and stuff like that while you were watching it.</v>

5173
02:25:03.740 --> 02:25:05.130
<v Speaker 5>So I think,</v>

5174
02:25:05.131 --> 02:25:05.340
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

5175
02:25:05.340 --> 02:25:10.020
<v Speaker 5>I think there's an issue right now of expectations and I think that when a</v>

5176
02:25:10.021 --> 02:25:11.400
<v Speaker 5>person logs on to Twitter,</v>

5177
02:25:11.820 --> 02:25:14.110
<v Speaker 5>they have obvious expectations of what there's,</v>

5178
02:25:14.130 --> 02:25:15.210
<v Speaker 5>what's going to be there,</v>

5179
02:25:15.270 --> 02:25:16.200
<v Speaker 5>the context of it,</v>

5180
02:25:16.650 --> 02:25:19.050
<v Speaker 5>and I think that for right now,</v>

5181
02:25:19.051 --> 02:25:23.260
<v Speaker 5>youtube is synonymous with video right now and it's going to be difficult for</v>

5182
02:25:23.261 --> 02:25:25.450
<v Speaker 5>any player at any length to come in there and change it.</v>

5183
02:25:26.040 --> 02:25:27.510
<v Speaker 1>I started taking pictures,</v>

5184
02:25:27.511 --> 02:25:29.940
<v Speaker 1>tweets of drawings of a,</v>

5185
02:25:29.941 --> 02:25:31.560
<v Speaker 1>of writings rather than I made.</v>

5186
02:25:31.590 --> 02:25:33.960
<v Speaker 1>I just thought I was going to do it for the rest of my tweets from now on.</v>

5187
02:25:33.961 --> 02:25:37.020
<v Speaker 1>It's just even a picture of shit that I wrote down so people could see my</v>

5188
02:25:37.021 --> 02:25:37.560
<v Speaker 1>handwriting,</v>

5189
02:25:37.560 --> 02:25:38.393
<v Speaker 1>but I only did it once.</v>

5190
02:25:38.490 --> 02:25:38.940
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

5191
02:25:38.940 --> 02:25:39.601
<v Speaker 5>Well it was like,</v>

5192
02:25:39.601 --> 02:25:40.434
<v Speaker 5>this is stupid.</v>

5193
02:25:41.380 --> 02:25:41.530
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

5194
02:25:41.530 --> 02:25:42.750
<v Speaker 5>the way I look at a right thing,</v>

5195
02:25:42.780 --> 02:25:43.531
<v Speaker 5>well not only that,</v>

5196
02:25:43.531 --> 02:25:48.030
<v Speaker 5>but the problem is there that a lot of what makes the web so good in finding</v>

5197
02:25:48.031 --> 02:25:50.580
<v Speaker 5>shit you care about is the fact that text is searchable.</v>

5198
02:25:50.700 --> 02:25:51.150
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

5199
02:25:51.150 --> 02:25:52.080
<v Speaker 5>You take a picture,</v>

5200
02:25:52.560 --> 02:25:53.460
<v Speaker 5>all that data's gone.</v>

5201
02:25:53.570 --> 02:25:54.260
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

5202
02:25:54.260 --> 02:25:57.230
<v Speaker 1>But what I was going to say is how infuriating would it be to people if you made</v>

5203
02:25:57.231 --> 02:26:01.620
<v Speaker 1>a youtube video of a bunch of shit you wrote like page after page of things you</v>

5204
02:26:01.630 --> 02:26:02.140
<v Speaker 1>wrote.</v>

5205
02:26:02.140 --> 02:26:03.740
<v Speaker 1>That was the thing was,</v>

5206
02:26:04.010 --> 02:26:07.160
<v Speaker 1>is really the people super depressed people.</v>

5207
02:26:07.220 --> 02:26:08.100
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

5208
02:26:08.530 --> 02:26:09.110
<v Speaker 1>it says,</v>

5209
02:26:09.110 --> 02:26:09.381
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

5210
02:26:09.381 --> 02:26:10.610
<v Speaker 1>I see they don't have a voice.</v>

5211
02:26:10.611 --> 02:26:11.900
<v Speaker 1>And then you turn the page.</v>

5212
02:26:12.080 --> 02:26:12.671
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

5213
02:26:12.671 --> 02:26:13.504
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

5214
02:26:13.660 --> 02:26:14.330
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

5215
02:26:14.330 --> 02:26:16.010
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever see that one where a woman,</v>

5216
02:26:16.250 --> 02:26:16.371
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5217
02:26:16.371 --> 02:26:21.200
<v Speaker 1>left a job and she wrote this a the page after page,</v>

5218
02:26:21.201 --> 02:26:23.570
<v Speaker 1>like a tumbler thing of all these cards,</v>

5219
02:26:23.750 --> 02:26:25.220
<v Speaker 1>like shitting on her boss.</v>

5220
02:26:25.590 --> 02:26:29.950
<v Speaker 1>And then so the boss wrote back and did the same forms.</v>

5221
02:26:29.960 --> 02:26:30.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5222
02:26:30.260 --> 02:26:34.220
<v Speaker 1>I signed the form and she was dancing around and shit to annihilated or yeah.</v>

5223
02:26:34.370 --> 02:26:34.671
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5224
02:26:34.671 --> 02:26:35.001
<v Speaker 1>she will.</v>

5225
02:26:35.001 --> 02:26:37.100
<v Speaker 1>She was wearing like sexy outfits and stuff like that.</v>

5226
02:26:37.101 --> 02:26:38.870
<v Speaker 1>And he was talking about how fucking stupid she was.</v>

5227
02:26:39.350 --> 02:26:41.750
<v Speaker 1>Incompetent and a bad employee and selfish.</v>

5228
02:26:42.010 --> 02:26:42.910
<v Speaker 5>That's interesting.</v>

5229
02:26:43.090 --> 02:26:46.960
<v Speaker 5>When precede people take old tech and introduce it into a new format.</v>

5230
02:26:47.860 --> 02:26:51.610
<v Speaker 5>The reason that they're doing it is because they're trying to imply,</v>

5231
02:26:52.420 --> 02:26:55.120
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if they try and make it more serious than it is,</v>

5232
02:26:55.121 --> 02:26:58.210
<v Speaker 5>but ultimately I think it's because that person is not the best at expressing</v>

5233
02:26:58.211 --> 02:27:00.040
<v Speaker 5>themselves in the real form.</v>

5234
02:27:00.330 --> 02:27:00.571
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

5235
02:27:00.571 --> 02:27:03.720
<v Speaker 1>that's weird because the original version of that was Bob Dylan.</v>

5236
02:27:04.470 --> 02:27:05.730
<v Speaker 1>Dylan would that song,</v>

5237
02:27:05.731 --> 02:27:08.190
<v Speaker 1>what was that song that he did that there was a music video,</v>

5238
02:27:08.430 --> 02:27:12.270
<v Speaker 1>an old Bob Dylan success did it.</v>

5239
02:27:12.380 --> 02:27:13.100
<v Speaker 5>I've seen it.</v>

5240
02:27:13.100 --> 02:27:16.790
<v Speaker 5>Do you think Bob Dylan was great at expressing himself?</v>

5241
02:27:16.940 --> 02:27:18.050
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

5242
02:27:18.260 --> 02:27:20.000
<v Speaker 5>You don't think he was great at expressing himself?</v>

5243
02:27:20.020 --> 02:27:20.090
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

5244
02:27:20.090 --> 02:27:20.270
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

5245
02:27:20.270 --> 02:27:20.960
<v Speaker 5>See,</v>

5246
02:27:20.960 --> 02:27:25.960
<v Speaker 5>but I appreciate abstract a representation,</v>

5247
02:27:26.480 --> 02:27:27.110
<v Speaker 5>but it's,</v>

5248
02:27:27.110 --> 02:27:29.570
<v Speaker 5>it's not the same as sitting in a room with somebody.</v>

5249
02:27:29.690 --> 02:27:30.290
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

5250
02:27:30.290 --> 02:27:32.060
<v Speaker 5>We never sat in a room with Bob Dylan.</v>

5251
02:27:32.200 --> 02:27:32.920
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

5252
02:27:32.920 --> 02:27:33.521
<v Speaker 1>That's good point.</v>

5253
02:27:33.521 --> 02:27:36.970
<v Speaker 1>But that was his art form was expressing himself through music,</v>

5254
02:27:37.030 --> 02:27:37.900
<v Speaker 5>did a great lyric,</v>

5255
02:27:37.901 --> 02:27:38.830
<v Speaker 5>a great job there.</v>

5256
02:27:39.050 --> 02:27:39.490
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

5257
02:27:39.490 --> 02:27:40.210
<v Speaker 5>and if you look at,</v>

5258
02:27:40.210 --> 02:27:41.530
<v Speaker 5>look at the lyrics and whatnot,</v>

5259
02:27:41.560 --> 02:27:45.040
<v Speaker 5>incredibly sophisticated and deep and meaningful and all the rest of it.</v>

5260
02:27:45.490 --> 02:27:46.510
<v Speaker 5>But I think,</v>

5261
02:27:46.570 --> 02:27:47.261
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>

5262
02:27:47.261 --> 02:27:48.790
<v Speaker 5>I'm drawing a separation myself.</v>

5263
02:27:48.791 --> 02:27:52.570
<v Speaker 5>I think art has always been a way for those,</v>

5264
02:27:53.290 --> 02:27:56.590
<v Speaker 5>for people to communicate in a format that's more comfortable for them.</v>

5265
02:27:57.310 --> 02:27:57.940
<v Speaker 5>You're going to go,</v>

5266
02:27:57.940 --> 02:27:59.050
<v Speaker 5>you're going to go to their party.</v>

5267
02:27:59.051 --> 02:28:00.070
<v Speaker 5>They're not going to come to yours.</v>

5268
02:28:00.310 --> 02:28:01.870
<v Speaker 5>Talking is something we all have to do.</v>

5269
02:28:02.990 --> 02:28:03.560
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

5270
02:28:03.560 --> 02:28:04.130
<v Speaker 1>You know it's,</v>

5271
02:28:04.130 --> 02:28:08.000
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting as well is if you went back to Bob Dylan's heyday,</v>

5272
02:28:08.100 --> 02:28:11.270
<v Speaker 1>you went to the 60s and the 70s and said,</v>

5273
02:28:11.870 --> 02:28:12.111
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

5274
02:28:12.111 --> 02:28:15.560
<v Speaker 1>we're going to make short films where you just talk about shit and then people</v>

5275
02:28:15.561 --> 02:28:17.540
<v Speaker 1>could take it and watch it and be like,</v>

5276
02:28:17.610 --> 02:28:19.070
<v Speaker 1>it seems it seems brutal,</v>

5277
02:28:19.071 --> 02:28:19.460
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

5278
02:28:19.460 --> 02:28:20.293
<v Speaker 1>He's terrible.</v>

5279
02:28:20.780 --> 02:28:22.130
<v Speaker 1>It like why would rather just</v>

5280
02:28:22.130 --> 02:28:22.821
<v Speaker 5>do a song?</v>

5281
02:28:22.821 --> 02:28:23.091
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

5282
02:28:23.091 --> 02:28:24.020
<v Speaker 5>why would we want our,</v>

5283
02:28:24.080 --> 02:28:26.000
<v Speaker 5>why would we want our Bob Dylan in that form?</v>

5284
02:28:26.210 --> 02:28:28.190
<v Speaker 5>But it's the same for celebrities nowadays.</v>

5285
02:28:28.310 --> 02:28:32.290
<v Speaker 5>It's like once upon a time a celebrity was like vapor.</v>

5286
02:28:32.300 --> 02:28:33.890
<v Speaker 5>Like what are they doing in their spare time now?</v>

5287
02:28:33.920 --> 02:28:35.990
<v Speaker 5>Charlie Sheen arguing with his ex wife on.</v>

5288
02:28:36.540 --> 02:28:37.160
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

5289
02:28:37.160 --> 02:28:37.993
<v Speaker 5>exactly.</v>

5290
02:28:38.030 --> 02:28:39.020
<v Speaker 5>Do they eat cheerios?</v>

5291
02:28:39.021 --> 02:28:39.770
<v Speaker 5>Like what is like,</v>

5292
02:28:39.770 --> 02:28:40.603
<v Speaker 5>are they real?</v>

5293
02:28:42.090 --> 02:28:43.320
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

5294
02:28:43.520 --> 02:28:44.570
<v Speaker 5>but now it's,</v>

5295
02:28:44.571 --> 02:28:49.571
<v Speaker 5>this exposure in so many ways has forced them to be real people at for us and we</v>

5296
02:28:49.881 --> 02:28:50.810
<v Speaker 5>can shit all over them,</v>

5297
02:28:51.440 --> 02:28:51.940
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

5298
02:28:51.940 --> 02:28:53.770
<v Speaker 1>Well this shitting all over him also.</v>

5299
02:28:53.890 --> 02:28:54.723
<v Speaker 1>We have the access</v>

5300
02:28:54.800 --> 02:28:55.190
<v Speaker 5>shit.</v>

5301
02:28:55.190 --> 02:28:55.910
<v Speaker 5>That's right.</v>

5302
02:28:55.910 --> 02:28:56.331
<v Speaker 5>That's right.</v>

5303
02:28:56.331 --> 02:28:56.501
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

5304
02:28:56.501 --> 02:28:57.021
<v Speaker 5>and again,</v>

5305
02:28:57.021 --> 02:28:59.750
<v Speaker 5>it's much like the traditional brand thing coming into youtube.</v>

5306
02:28:59.751 --> 02:29:04.250
<v Speaker 5>It's like the traditional people have to come to our party now you see they just</v>

5307
02:29:04.251 --> 02:29:05.660
<v Speaker 5>got a profile like anyone else.</v>

5308
02:29:05.750 --> 02:29:06.261
<v Speaker 1>Well sort of.</v>

5309
02:29:06.261 --> 02:29:08.120
<v Speaker 1>And then there's people that exploit that opening.</v>

5310
02:29:08.121 --> 02:29:10.310
<v Speaker 1>Like if you have a good article,</v>

5311
02:29:10.520 --> 02:29:15.520
<v Speaker 1>a TMZ article about Kim and Kanye that is essentially a portal for hate.</v>

5312
02:29:15.950 --> 02:29:16.783
<v Speaker 1>That's all that is.</v>

5313
02:29:17.090 --> 02:29:21.080
<v Speaker 1>What that exists is you open up the comments and then just let the floodgates of</v>

5314
02:29:21.081 --> 02:29:26.081
<v Speaker 1>hell just open up on the photo of Kim and Kanye kissing in front of some fucking</v>

5315
02:29:26.301 --> 02:29:27.170
<v Speaker 1>fountain somewhere.</v>

5316
02:29:27.380 --> 02:29:32.380
<v Speaker 1>So it's a fucked up to me that people give a shit about that give a shit what I,</v>

5317
02:29:32.751 --> 02:29:34.790
<v Speaker 1>it's probably second only to porn.</v>

5318
02:29:35.510 --> 02:29:36.200
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

5319
02:29:36.200 --> 02:29:38.750
<v Speaker 1>If you thought about like the amount of internet space,</v>

5320
02:29:38.751 --> 02:29:42.680
<v Speaker 1>it's used to just shit on random targets of hate.</v>

5321
02:29:43.310 --> 02:29:46.550
<v Speaker 1>Whether it's like some ridiculous celebrities like it used to be Paris Hilton</v>

5322
02:29:46.850 --> 02:29:48.600
<v Speaker 1>and that bitch just evaporated piece.</v>

5323
02:29:48.601 --> 02:29:49.520
<v Speaker 1>She vanished.</v>

5324
02:29:49.760 --> 02:29:49.911
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

5325
02:29:49.911 --> 02:29:54.560
<v Speaker 5>realize that piggy backing on that is so fucking low.</v>

5326
02:29:54.830 --> 02:29:58.340
<v Speaker 1>Who the people that are commenting or the people that are bald of it,</v>

5327
02:29:58.550 --> 02:29:59.240
<v Speaker 1>all of it.</v>

5328
02:29:59.240 --> 02:29:59.421
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

5329
02:29:59.421 --> 02:30:02.180
<v Speaker 1>the people that are making it was TMZ or any of these.</v>

5330
02:30:02.270 --> 02:30:04.070
<v Speaker 1>They're making a lot of money and it's,</v>

5331
02:30:04.071 --> 02:30:04.670
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

5332
02:30:04.670 --> 02:30:05.271
<v Speaker 1>if you ever seen,</v>

5333
02:30:05.271 --> 02:30:05.870
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

5334
02:30:05.870 --> 02:30:08.120
<v Speaker 1>Morgan Spurlock has that show inside.</v>

5335
02:30:08.121 --> 02:30:08.500
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

5336
02:30:08.500 --> 02:30:09.333
<v Speaker 1>You ever see that show?</v>

5337
02:30:09.350 --> 02:30:09.561
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

5338
02:30:09.561 --> 02:30:10.700
<v Speaker 1>I've seen these documentaries though.</v>

5339
02:30:10.760 --> 02:30:11.480
<v Speaker 1>Good show.</v>

5340
02:30:11.480 --> 02:30:12.110
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

5341
02:30:12.110 --> 02:30:16.820
<v Speaker 1>it's on CNN and he does a bunch of different jobs like in just,</v>

5342
02:30:16.821 --> 02:30:20.570
<v Speaker 1>we'll go inside and see what it's like to be different people's lives.</v>

5343
02:30:21.110 --> 02:30:24.830
<v Speaker 1>And one of them he did was he hung out with a bunch of Paparazzi and the way</v>

5344
02:30:24.831 --> 02:30:25.461
<v Speaker 1>they see it,</v>

5345
02:30:25.461 --> 02:30:25.791
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

5346
02:30:25.791 --> 02:30:26.031
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

5347
02:30:26.031 --> 02:30:26.900
<v Speaker 1>this is a Gig.</v>

5348
02:30:27.000 --> 02:30:27.740
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

5349
02:30:27.740 --> 02:30:28.820
<v Speaker 1>you wanted to be famous.</v>

5350
02:30:29.670 --> 02:30:30.210
<v Speaker 5>You know what?</v>

5351
02:30:30.210 --> 02:30:31.290
<v Speaker 5>Let's leave them out.</v>

5352
02:30:31.590 --> 02:30:36.180
<v Speaker 5>Let's go boil it down all the way to the consumption because that's what drives</v>

5353
02:30:36.270 --> 02:30:37.020
<v Speaker 5>everything else.</v>

5354
02:30:37.020 --> 02:30:37.380
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>

5355
02:30:37.380 --> 02:30:39.090
<v Speaker 5>that's the fuel,</v>

5356
02:30:39.150 --> 02:30:39.870
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

5357
02:30:39.870 --> 02:30:40.350
<v Speaker 5>Why is it,</v>

5358
02:30:40.350 --> 02:30:42.630
<v Speaker 5>why is that something that human beings want to consume?</v>

5359
02:30:42.660 --> 02:30:43.770
<v Speaker 5>Because it's fascinating.</v>

5360
02:30:43.800 --> 02:30:45.690
<v Speaker 5>Why is that fast as stupid as fuck.</v>

5361
02:30:46.800 --> 02:30:47.633
<v Speaker 5>Cause why?</v>

5362
02:30:47.700 --> 02:30:49.110
<v Speaker 5>Why does it matter?</v>

5363
02:30:50.160 --> 02:30:53.250
<v Speaker 5>Why does it matter what Kim Kardashians and Kanye West are doing it?</v>

5364
02:30:53.460 --> 02:30:56.500
<v Speaker 1>It's actually been studied by sociologists and they,</v>

5365
02:30:56.600 --> 02:31:01.600
<v Speaker 1>our conclusion is that gossip was a way of keeping monitoring behavior and the</v>

5366
02:31:03.690 --> 02:31:08.690
<v Speaker 1>sort of reactions to our own behavior and how people perceived us in the</v>

5367
02:31:09.001 --> 02:31:09.780
<v Speaker 1>community.</v>

5368
02:31:09.780 --> 02:31:12.720
<v Speaker 1>And it's sort of to elevate themselves by trial and error.</v>

5369
02:31:12.721 --> 02:31:13.800
<v Speaker 1>Where we talked about earlier,</v>

5370
02:31:13.801 --> 02:31:15.090
<v Speaker 1>learning from your mistakes.</v>

5371
02:31:15.360 --> 02:31:19.140
<v Speaker 1>Well those mistakes sometimes or socially being ostracized,</v>

5372
02:31:19.500 --> 02:31:20.170
<v Speaker 1>your act,</v>

5373
02:31:20.170 --> 02:31:22.230
<v Speaker 2>so your words or you know,</v>

5374
02:31:22.231 --> 02:31:24.360
<v Speaker 2>those things existed in communities.</v>

5375
02:31:24.361 --> 02:31:25.610
<v Speaker 2>Kind of keep people in check.</v>

5376
02:31:25.920 --> 02:31:28.710
<v Speaker 2>Well now we live in communities where I've been in the same house for 10 years.</v>

5377
02:31:28.711 --> 02:31:30.110
<v Speaker 2>I barely know my fucking neighbors,</v>

5378
02:31:30.120 --> 02:31:30.361
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

5379
02:31:30.361 --> 02:31:31.410
<v Speaker 2>I mean barely.</v>

5380
02:31:31.460 --> 02:31:32.160
<v Speaker 2>I wait.</v>

5381
02:31:32.160 --> 02:31:35.070
<v Speaker 2>There's a few people in my neighborhood that I'm pretty friendly with that I've</v>

5382
02:31:35.071 --> 02:31:37.260
<v Speaker 2>seen over the Times that we've had conversations.</v>

5383
02:31:37.261 --> 02:31:38.790
<v Speaker 2>But we don't hang out.</v>

5384
02:31:39.030 --> 02:31:39.541
<v Speaker 2>We don't want,</v>

5385
02:31:39.541 --> 02:31:42.330
<v Speaker 2>no one's knocking on my door and coming over for dinners.</v>

5386
02:31:42.510 --> 02:31:43.140
<v Speaker 2>You know this,</v>

5387
02:31:43.140 --> 02:31:48.140
<v Speaker 2>we have these weird environments that we live in now and we have this desire to</v>

5388
02:31:48.751 --> 02:31:50.310
<v Speaker 2>find out what everyone else is up to.</v>

5389
02:31:50.580 --> 02:31:53.670
<v Speaker 2>And the only real way to do that is through gossip.</v>

5390
02:31:53.940 --> 02:31:55.410
<v Speaker 2>And when there's no gossip,</v>

5391
02:31:55.560 --> 02:31:58.560
<v Speaker 2>you just go to the gossip of the kings and Queens,</v>

5392
02:31:58.770 --> 02:32:01.110
<v Speaker 2>who is the kings and Queens movie stars,</v>

5393
02:32:01.140 --> 02:32:02.030
<v Speaker 2>Rock Stars,</v>

5394
02:32:02.050 --> 02:32:05.670
<v Speaker 2>those people that you see in her low fees and form of communication though.</v>

5395
02:32:05.920 --> 02:32:06.180
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

5396
02:32:06.180 --> 02:32:07.470
<v Speaker 2>but so compelling.</v>

5397
02:32:07.500 --> 02:32:08.490
<v Speaker 2>So then it becomes,</v>

5398
02:32:08.491 --> 02:32:08.761
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

5399
02:32:08.761 --> 02:32:09.780
<v Speaker 2>if it's so low,</v>

5400
02:32:09.870 --> 02:32:11.520
<v Speaker 2>why do so many people engage in it?</v>

5401
02:32:11.521 --> 02:32:12.540
<v Speaker 2>What is the draw?</v>

5402
02:32:12.541 --> 02:32:13.290
<v Speaker 2>What is the,</v>

5403
02:32:13.290 --> 02:32:18.290
<v Speaker 2>there's some sort of base human attraction to finding out what tiger woods</v>

5404
02:32:19.980 --> 02:32:22.680
<v Speaker 2>texted to all those freaky bitches on his,</v>

5405
02:32:22.681 --> 02:32:22.940
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5406
02:32:22.940 --> 02:32:23.773
<v Speaker 2>his hit list.</v>

5407
02:32:23.930 --> 02:32:24.240
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

5408
02:32:24.240 --> 02:32:26.540
<v Speaker 2>there's some strange thing to finding out about,</v>

5409
02:32:26.550 --> 02:32:29.130
<v Speaker 2>I guess it makes people feel better about themselves.</v>

5410
02:32:29.150 --> 02:32:31.530
<v Speaker 2>It seems excited finding out some dirt.</v>

5411
02:32:31.830 --> 02:32:32.191
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

5412
02:32:32.191 --> 02:32:33.960
<v Speaker 2>But at the same time they can point and say,</v>

5413
02:32:33.961 --> 02:32:34.950
<v Speaker 2>you're the fucked up one,</v>

5414
02:32:34.951 --> 02:32:36.060
<v Speaker 2>so my life's more normal,</v>

5415
02:32:36.061 --> 02:32:36.900
<v Speaker 2>or my life's better.</v>

5416
02:32:36.930 --> 02:32:37.021
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

5417
02:32:37.021 --> 02:32:38.600
<v Speaker 2>it takes the focus on the fucked up.</v>

5418
02:32:38.610 --> 02:32:39.031
<v Speaker 2>They never,</v>

5419
02:32:39.031 --> 02:32:43.230
<v Speaker 2>when Britney spears was like imploding or whatever it was head and went navy and</v>

5420
02:32:43.231 --> 02:32:45.420
<v Speaker 2>it was an opportunity for people to point and say,</v>

5421
02:32:45.421 --> 02:32:46.740
<v Speaker 2>look how fucking crazy she is.</v>

5422
02:32:46.770 --> 02:32:49.340
<v Speaker 2>The photos of her with a fucking umbrella wielding it.</v>

5423
02:32:49.350 --> 02:32:50.550
<v Speaker 2>Photographers Agley.</v>

5424
02:32:50.940 --> 02:32:51.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5425
02:32:51.480 --> 02:32:52.010
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

5426
02:32:52.010 --> 02:32:52.620
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

5427
02:32:52.620 --> 02:32:54.150
<v Speaker 2>definitely makes you,</v>

5428
02:32:54.240 --> 02:32:56.130
<v Speaker 2>especially when it's that bad.</v>

5429
02:32:56.270 --> 02:33:00.090
<v Speaker 2>When do you remember David Hasselhoff has daughter released a video of him</v>

5430
02:33:00.120 --> 02:33:01.590
<v Speaker 2>unbelievably drunk,</v>

5431
02:33:01.591 --> 02:33:02.401
<v Speaker 2>like scrounging.</v>

5432
02:33:02.401 --> 02:33:02.880
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

5433
02:33:02.880 --> 02:33:04.110
<v Speaker 2>I do a hamburger.</v>

5434
02:33:04.230 --> 02:33:06.510
<v Speaker 2>I recall that it was so insane.</v>

5435
02:33:06.800 --> 02:33:09.630
<v Speaker 2>You see this poor fucking side throws of sick.</v>

5436
02:33:09.650 --> 02:33:14.310
<v Speaker 2>I see shit like scrambling up food like that and she shit like that as traps.</v>

5437
02:33:14.370 --> 02:33:15.420
<v Speaker 2>Like if I'm on the web,</v>

5438
02:33:15.540 --> 02:33:16.830
<v Speaker 2>that's like a bear trap to me.</v>

5439
02:33:17.610 --> 02:33:18.720
<v Speaker 2>I know it stuck in it.</v>

5440
02:33:18.750 --> 02:33:20.850
<v Speaker 2>You know that that bay link Bait and shit.</v>

5441
02:33:20.950 --> 02:33:21.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5442
02:33:21.580 --> 02:33:23.630
<v Speaker 2>If you see the web,</v>

5443
02:33:23.631 --> 02:33:28.631
<v Speaker 2>he's consumed in these tidbits and all you need to do is grip a p a person on</v>

5444
02:33:28.741 --> 02:33:31.050
<v Speaker 2>the lowest common denominator and you win.</v>

5445
02:33:31.500 --> 02:33:36.500
<v Speaker 2>And it's like if the consumers themselves don't man the fuck up and see a trap</v>

5446
02:33:37.141 --> 02:33:39.120
<v Speaker 2>when it's there and not click on it,</v>

5447
02:33:39.860 --> 02:33:40.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5448
02:33:40.110 --> 02:33:42.610
<v Speaker 2>I mean obviously it's,</v>

5449
02:33:42.611 --> 02:33:44.550
<v Speaker 2>it's obviously a discussion that you're not,</v>

5450
02:33:44.580 --> 02:33:45.810
<v Speaker 2>you can't get to the bottom of,</v>

5451
02:33:46.110 --> 02:33:49.590
<v Speaker 2>but it's like you are essentially supporting the kind of shit you don't really,</v>

5452
02:33:49.591 --> 02:33:50.250
<v Speaker 2>like.</v>

5453
02:33:50.250 --> 02:33:53.460
<v Speaker 2>I was reading this thing on pornography recently or watching,</v>

5454
02:33:53.461 --> 02:33:55.380
<v Speaker 2>this thing's a ted talk on pornography.</v>

5455
02:33:55.381 --> 02:33:58.620
<v Speaker 2>Somebody sent it to me on Twitter and they said this guy is the biggest white</v>

5456
02:33:58.621 --> 02:33:59.454
<v Speaker 2>night ever.</v>

5457
02:33:59.820 --> 02:34:03.840
<v Speaker 2>And I expected it to be just like a tumbler website were some dude was like</v>

5458
02:34:03.990 --> 02:34:06.030
<v Speaker 2>arguing about being a male feminist or something.</v>

5459
02:34:06.900 --> 02:34:07.890
<v Speaker 2>Some along those lines.</v>

5460
02:34:08.040 --> 02:34:11.910
<v Speaker 2>But it was a guy who actually made these like pretty intense detailed points</v>

5461
02:34:11.911 --> 02:34:12.780
<v Speaker 2>about what's the,</v>

5462
02:34:12.781 --> 02:34:15.330
<v Speaker 2>the real issue with watching pornography.</v>

5463
02:34:15.900 --> 02:34:18.070
<v Speaker 2>And it was pretty because it was</v>

5464
02:34:18.070 --> 02:34:19.330
<v Speaker 1>really in depth.</v>

5465
02:34:19.400 --> 02:34:19.720
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

5466
02:34:19.720 --> 02:34:21.790
<v Speaker 1>And he was talking about a lot of shit that's,</v>

5467
02:34:22.450 --> 02:34:23.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5468
02:34:23.080 --> 02:34:26.620
<v Speaker 1>pretty undeniable and uniquely undeniable.</v>

5469
02:34:26.650 --> 02:34:29.560
<v Speaker 1>Like one of the things he was talking about is that the,</v>

5470
02:34:29.920 --> 02:34:34.920
<v Speaker 1>that a lot of sex in porn is nothing like sex in real life in that there's no</v>

5471
02:34:37.421 --> 02:34:42.050
<v Speaker 1>hands and what he meant was there's no caressing and massaging,</v>

5472
02:34:42.070 --> 02:34:46.240
<v Speaker 1>rubbing and holding and all the thing that people do when they make love they,</v>

5473
02:34:46.450 --> 02:34:47.201
<v Speaker 1>they make love.</v>

5474
02:34:47.201 --> 02:34:47.841
<v Speaker 1>Notice how I said that,</v>

5475
02:34:47.841 --> 02:34:48.674
<v Speaker 1>and very sensitive.</v>

5476
02:34:48.820 --> 02:34:52.060
<v Speaker 1>Instead it's like the people that are doing things at odd angles.</v>

5477
02:34:52.120 --> 02:34:54.550
<v Speaker 1>He was a little white in it for sure,</v>

5478
02:34:54.700 --> 02:34:55.300
<v Speaker 1>but there's a,</v>

5479
02:34:55.300 --> 02:34:57.410
<v Speaker 1>it's undeniable that when you take no,</v>

5480
02:34:57.460 --> 02:35:01.060
<v Speaker 1>don't just have this idea in your head and it might be something wrong with</v>

5481
02:35:01.061 --> 02:35:01.751
<v Speaker 1>watching porn,</v>

5482
02:35:01.751 --> 02:35:05.440
<v Speaker 1>but have it so much so that you've concocted a Ted talk and you know you're</v>

5483
02:35:05.470 --> 02:35:08.740
<v Speaker 1>presented yourself as this moral alternative,</v>

5484
02:35:08.920 --> 02:35:11.890
<v Speaker 1>this moral and ethical alternative to all the other men out there.</v>

5485
02:35:11.891 --> 02:35:15.220
<v Speaker 1>This is certainly like a progressive brownie point,</v>

5486
02:35:15.760 --> 02:35:18.310
<v Speaker 1>sort of a pull of that initiative.</v>

5487
02:35:18.960 --> 02:35:23.560
<v Speaker 5>Did something regarding the pornography thing though that I think is interesting</v>

5488
02:35:23.561 --> 02:35:28.561
<v Speaker 5>and maybe a reason why from a discussion standpoint there is something there is</v>

5489
02:35:28.721 --> 02:35:32.110
<v Speaker 5>because at once upon a time the consumption of porn,</v>

5490
02:35:32.170 --> 02:35:33.370
<v Speaker 5>I dunno when I was a kid,</v>

5491
02:35:33.371 --> 02:35:35.620
<v Speaker 5>I guess I don't know because I sorta missed it.</v>

5492
02:35:36.400 --> 02:35:40.060
<v Speaker 5>You had to physically go and get it to video tape or for</v>

5493
02:35:40.230 --> 02:35:41.020
<v Speaker 1>end magazine.</v>

5494
02:35:41.020 --> 02:35:41.980
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you son,</v>

5495
02:35:42.100 --> 02:35:44.560
<v Speaker 1>cause I was around back then when I was young,</v>

5496
02:35:44.650 --> 02:35:48.190
<v Speaker 1>they had video stores and this was before blockbuster even took off.</v>

5497
02:35:48.340 --> 02:35:53.340
<v Speaker 1>It was mom and pop video stores and you would go to these local video stores and</v>

5498
02:35:53.411 --> 02:35:53.681
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5499
02:35:53.681 --> 02:35:55.540
<v Speaker 1>I still have to watch you walk into the bag.</v>

5500
02:35:55.630 --> 02:35:57.730
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you have memberships to these videos,</v>

5501
02:35:57.731 --> 02:35:58.180
<v Speaker 1>stores,</v>

5502
02:35:58.180 --> 02:36:01.120
<v Speaker 1>remember those and you had a card and they would punch your card.</v>

5503
02:36:01.121 --> 02:36:04.180
<v Speaker 1>And every 10th video you've got to fucking discount or free video.</v>

5504
02:36:04.480 --> 02:36:05.313
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

5505
02:36:05.470 --> 02:36:05.771
<v Speaker 1>there was,</v>

5506
02:36:05.771 --> 02:36:06.040
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5507
02:36:06.040 --> 02:36:11.040
<v Speaker 1>like you would push beads aside or like saloon doors and you would go into this</v>

5508
02:36:12.251 --> 02:36:15.460
<v Speaker 1>area and it was all chicks and fucking ass isn't,</v>

5509
02:36:15.620 --> 02:36:19.750
<v Speaker 1>and mostly not like really hardcore shit like you're seeing today.</v>

5510
02:36:20.190 --> 02:36:23.140
<v Speaker 1>Like they would actually like the covers of these,</v>

5511
02:36:23.650 --> 02:36:27.910
<v Speaker 1>these videos would sort of be concocted knowing that they were going to be</v>

5512
02:36:27.911 --> 02:36:29.940
<v Speaker 1>placed on a shelf somewhere.</v>

5513
02:36:30.340 --> 02:36:34.660
<v Speaker 1>It's so much could kind of just get to as opposed to typing in,</v>

5514
02:36:34.810 --> 02:36:35.051
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5515
02:36:35.051 --> 02:36:38.740
<v Speaker 1>suck my cock.com or whatever the hell it is and you're going to go right there.</v>

5516
02:36:38.770 --> 02:36:40.330
<v Speaker 1>So you know what to expect.</v>

5517
02:36:40.450 --> 02:36:43.600
<v Speaker 1>American pornography consumption pre-internet.</v>

5518
02:36:43.710 --> 02:36:47.980
<v Speaker 1>Post-Internet well I think it's a lot like our gossip consumption.</v>

5519
02:36:48.310 --> 02:36:49.600
<v Speaker 1>We have access to it,</v>

5520
02:36:49.630 --> 02:36:50.980
<v Speaker 1>we're going to consume more of it.</v>

5521
02:36:51.010 --> 02:36:52.900
<v Speaker 1>But the amplification level on porn,</v>

5522
02:36:52.901 --> 02:36:54.130
<v Speaker 1>I think he's like nothing else.</v>

5523
02:36:54.160 --> 02:36:55.330
<v Speaker 1>I think it's like both of them.</v>

5524
02:36:55.360 --> 02:36:59.170
<v Speaker 1>I think both of them have massive amplification levels because you access,</v>

5525
02:36:59.200 --> 02:36:59.950
<v Speaker 1>let's put it this way,</v>

5526
02:36:59.950 --> 02:37:03.910
<v Speaker 1>but you could always go to a grocery store and walk out the door with a gossip</v>

5527
02:37:03.911 --> 02:37:04.744
<v Speaker 1>magazine.</v>

5528
02:37:04.780 --> 02:37:06.340
<v Speaker 1>Super easy access,</v>

5529
02:37:06.600 --> 02:37:08.050
<v Speaker 1>eat the saloon door thing.</v>

5530
02:37:08.450 --> 02:37:09.400
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's like what?</v>

5531
02:37:09.401 --> 02:37:11.490
<v Speaker 1>Two into every town and it's was,</v>

5532
02:37:11.560 --> 02:37:13.540
<v Speaker 1>it was in a corner somewhere.</v>

5533
02:37:13.660 --> 02:37:14.261
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

5534
02:37:14.261 --> 02:37:14.680
<v Speaker 1>But it's,</v>

5535
02:37:14.680 --> 02:37:16.790
<v Speaker 1>but magazine is very finite,</v>

5536
02:37:16.910 --> 02:37:17.210
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

5537
02:37:17.210 --> 02:37:19.040
<v Speaker 1>Maybe there's two or three of them on the shelf.</v>

5538
02:37:19.070 --> 02:37:19.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5539
02:37:19.490 --> 02:37:20.061
<v Speaker 1>Your daughter.</v>

5540
02:37:20.061 --> 02:37:22.640
<v Speaker 1>When you get from front to back and you had to stop consuming it.</v>

5541
02:37:22.800 --> 02:37:26.120
<v Speaker 1>There's not a lot of stuff there aren't there are parallels there.</v>

5542
02:37:26.210 --> 02:37:28.190
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think probably the pornography one,</v>

5543
02:37:29.330 --> 02:37:31.210
<v Speaker 1>I think both of them are based on human incentive.</v>

5544
02:37:31.220 --> 02:37:32.053
<v Speaker 1>Fucking similar.</v>

5545
02:37:32.150 --> 02:37:32.901
<v Speaker 1>They're both based on,</v>

5546
02:37:32.901 --> 02:37:35.420
<v Speaker 1>so how about this gossip is porn for girls?</v>

5547
02:37:35.810 --> 02:37:36.643
<v Speaker 1>For Women.</v>

5548
02:37:37.250 --> 02:37:38.083
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

5549
02:37:39.140 --> 02:37:40.790
<v Speaker 1>But it's not I,</v>

5550
02:37:41.960 --> 02:37:42.290
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

5551
02:37:42.290 --> 02:37:43.740
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it is pouring.</v>

5552
02:37:44.200 --> 02:37:45.860
<v Speaker 1>Well this is obviously still porn for women,</v>

5553
02:37:45.861 --> 02:37:46.130
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

5554
02:37:46.130 --> 02:37:49.430
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you one thing you can be sure of if there's a man who's really into</v>

5555
02:37:49.431 --> 02:37:50.240
<v Speaker 1>gossip,</v>

5556
02:37:50.240 --> 02:37:51.650
<v Speaker 1>that guy's a bitch.</v>

5557
02:37:52.280 --> 02:37:53.360
<v Speaker 1>That's a fact.</v>

5558
02:37:53.361 --> 02:37:57.680
<v Speaker 1>If there's a man out there who's really into like this girl shoes or that girls</v>

5559
02:37:57.681 --> 02:37:59.860
<v Speaker 1>dress and look at her stupid car like</v>

5560
02:38:00.910 --> 02:38:01.480
<v Speaker 3>I think there's,</v>

5561
02:38:01.480 --> 02:38:02.590
<v Speaker 3>I think there's gossip.</v>

5562
02:38:02.740 --> 02:38:05.830
<v Speaker 3>I think guys and girls like gossip for the same reason that like if you go to a</v>

5563
02:38:05.831 --> 02:38:06.610
<v Speaker 3>movie and you're,</v>

5564
02:38:06.610 --> 02:38:08.170
<v Speaker 3>you like Brad Pitt movies,</v>

5565
02:38:08.620 --> 02:38:11.410
<v Speaker 3>you also want to know what Brad Pitt's doing it in real life.</v>

5566
02:38:11.411 --> 02:38:12.790
<v Speaker 3>Like is he getting,</v>

5567
02:38:12.820 --> 02:38:13.810
<v Speaker 3>doing drugs and,</v>

5568
02:38:13.860 --> 02:38:14.840
<v Speaker 1>but that's only if drink,</v>

5569
02:38:14.850 --> 02:38:16.470
<v Speaker 1>like someone who's a movie star.</v>

5570
02:38:16.471 --> 02:38:19.560
<v Speaker 1>When you talk about Kim and Kim Kardashians and her family,</v>

5571
02:38:19.561 --> 02:38:20.010
<v Speaker 1>they don't,</v>

5572
02:38:20.010 --> 02:38:21.090
<v Speaker 1>they don't do anything.</v>

5573
02:38:22.680 --> 02:38:26.940
<v Speaker 1>They miss rappers ever later that he's a recent addition to that fucking circus.</v>

5574
02:38:27.000 --> 02:38:28.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to use this opportunity to go for that.</v>

5575
02:38:28.561 --> 02:38:28.711
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5576
02:38:28.711 --> 02:38:29.250
<v Speaker 1>please do.</v>

5577
02:38:29.250 --> 02:38:32.310
<v Speaker 1>Before that there was nothing.</v>

5578
02:38:32.550 --> 02:38:34.050
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you stop to think about it,</v>

5579
02:38:34.051 --> 02:38:36.060
<v Speaker 1>cheap contributed nothing.</v>

5580
02:38:36.360 --> 02:38:39.120
<v Speaker 1>All she was doing was being a point of gossip.</v>

5581
02:38:39.630 --> 02:38:40.620
<v Speaker 1>So in that sense,</v>

5582
02:38:40.621 --> 02:38:45.300
<v Speaker 1>she's way bigger gossip star than any Angelina Jolie's story.</v>

5583
02:38:45.540 --> 02:38:46.021
<v Speaker 1>You know the,</v>

5584
02:38:46.021 --> 02:38:49.230
<v Speaker 1>if you looked at the number of people that are paid attention to Kim Kardashians</v>

5585
02:38:49.410 --> 02:38:51.150
<v Speaker 1>versus paying attention to Angelina Jolie,</v>

5586
02:38:51.151 --> 02:38:55.350
<v Speaker 1>I bet I'd be willing to better like five or six to one and Kim's favorite.</v>

5587
02:38:55.590 --> 02:39:00.590
<v Speaker 1>So I think it's more of Oh look at her and if you can do things to keep eyes on</v>

5588
02:39:01.411 --> 02:39:01.980
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

5589
02:39:01.980 --> 02:39:02.221
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

5590
02:39:02.221 --> 02:39:03.300
<v Speaker 1>that's your business.</v>

5591
02:39:03.301 --> 02:39:06.840
<v Speaker 1>Whether it's hate or love your business is to keep that.</v>

5592
02:39:07.020 --> 02:39:08.310
<v Speaker 1>That's sort of weird.</v>

5593
02:39:08.610 --> 02:39:10.170
<v Speaker 1>Gossipy energy up.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>

5632
02:40:08.140 --> 02:40:10.270
<v Speaker 1>That shows you how Twitter is crazy.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's God damn voicemail.</v>

5657
02:40:49.410 --> 02:40:50.480
<v Speaker 2>What planet are you live in?</v>

5658
02:40:50.730 --> 02:40:53.220
<v Speaker 2>You can't agree to the same descriptives.</v>

5659
02:40:53.221 --> 02:40:54.900
<v Speaker 2>Could that be a translation thing?</v>

5660
02:40:54.901 --> 02:40:55.920
<v Speaker 2>Maybe Watch,</v>

5661
02:40:55.960 --> 02:40:57.120
<v Speaker 2>she speaks English well,</v>

5662
02:40:57.660 --> 02:40:58.450
<v Speaker 2>sort of.</v>

5663
02:40:58.450 --> 02:40:59.220
<v Speaker 2>She speaks,</v>

5664
02:40:59.220 --> 02:41:00.240
<v Speaker 2>she's been around.</v>

5665
02:41:00.420 --> 02:41:02.310
<v Speaker 2>She's been speaking as long as I've been alive.</v>

5666
02:41:04.010 --> 02:41:04.843
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5667
02:41:05.260 --> 02:41:07.890
<v Speaker 2>but people never really fully grab it if they didn't,</v>

5668
02:41:08.070 --> 02:41:08.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5669
02:41:08.670 --> 02:41:12.360
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand how people could be in this country for so long and</v>

5670
02:41:12.361 --> 02:41:17.361
<v Speaker 2>communicate with like I have people in my life that I know that work in certain</v>

5671
02:41:17.521 --> 02:41:19.980
<v Speaker 2>places that I visit that speak Spanish mostly.</v>

5672
02:41:20.010 --> 02:41:20.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5673
02:41:20.220 --> 02:41:24.120
<v Speaker 2>And I've been communicating with them for years and they still don't know how to</v>

5674
02:41:24.121 --> 02:41:24.954
<v Speaker 2>talk English.</v>

5675
02:41:25.020 --> 02:41:25.853
<v Speaker 2>I've met the like,</v>

5676
02:41:26.070 --> 02:41:27.510
<v Speaker 2>how hard is it man?</v>

5677
02:41:27.630 --> 02:41:29.160
<v Speaker 2>Is it that fucking hard?</v>

5678
02:41:29.310 --> 02:41:32.310
<v Speaker 2>My daughter's four and I can talk to her.</v>

5679
02:41:32.430 --> 02:41:34.350
<v Speaker 2>I've known you for 15 fucking years.</v>

5680
02:41:34.351 --> 02:41:36.420
<v Speaker 2>I've been coming to this place and I still can't understand.</v>

5681
02:41:37.000 --> 02:41:40.230
<v Speaker 2>That exposes this thing we were talking about earlier,</v>

5682
02:41:40.231 --> 02:41:45.231
<v Speaker 2>but how when you're young you have a cape capabilities to learn that will never</v>

5683
02:41:45.451 --> 02:41:46.470
<v Speaker 2>be replicated again.</v>

5684
02:41:46.500 --> 02:41:49.470
<v Speaker 2>That's not true either because I know people that have picked up languages late</v>

5685
02:41:49.471 --> 02:41:51.570
<v Speaker 2>into their fifties and they're fucking awesome at it.</v>

5686
02:41:52.350 --> 02:41:52.921
<v Speaker 2>I know people,</v>

5687
02:41:52.921 --> 02:41:54.500
<v Speaker 2>there's always going to be outliers,</v>

5688
02:41:54.501 --> 02:41:55.590
<v Speaker 2>so I was going to be special people,</v>

5689
02:41:55.591 --> 02:41:57.860
<v Speaker 2>but the average immigrant is,</v>

5690
02:41:57.910 --> 02:42:01.770
<v Speaker 2>he's never going to sound like a fluent person who grew up here.</v>

5691
02:42:01.800 --> 02:42:02.071
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5692
02:42:02.071 --> 02:42:06.360
<v Speaker 2>but that's mostly because they keep themselves in communities that are other</v>

5693
02:42:06.361 --> 02:42:10.500
<v Speaker 2>immigrants and they speak their native language and I know they don't attempt to</v>

5694
02:42:10.501 --> 02:42:10.861
<v Speaker 2>do it,</v>

5695
02:42:10.861 --> 02:42:14.850
<v Speaker 2>but if you immerse yourself in whatever culture is Spanish culture and want to</v>

5696
02:42:14.851 --> 02:42:15.810
<v Speaker 2>learn how to speak Spanish,</v>

5697
02:42:15.811 --> 02:42:16.110
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

5698
02:42:16.110 --> 02:42:19.500
<v Speaker 2>I know people that have learned in their adulthood learn how to speak Spanish.</v>

5699
02:42:19.501 --> 02:42:20.910
<v Speaker 2>They speak perfect Spanish.</v>

5700
02:42:21.210 --> 02:42:22.560
<v Speaker 2>They just chose to do it.</v>

5701
02:42:22.561 --> 02:42:24.240
<v Speaker 2>It's not impossible to do.</v>

5702
02:42:24.241 --> 02:42:24.630
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

5703
02:42:24.630 --> 02:42:25.980
<v Speaker 2>it's all just a matter of focus.</v>

5704
02:42:26.130 --> 02:42:29.370
<v Speaker 2>If you can get good at swimming into your thirties very few.</v>

5705
02:42:29.680 --> 02:42:32.910
<v Speaker 2>You'll see very few Western people learn how to speak Asian languages.</v>

5706
02:42:33.090 --> 02:42:33.361
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

5707
02:42:33.361 --> 02:42:38.361
<v Speaker 2>But I think that is more of a time and interest thing than it is of an ability.</v>

5708
02:42:38.660 --> 02:42:39.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5709
02:42:39.000 --> 02:42:40.110
<v Speaker 2>I sense a challenge here.</v>

5710
02:42:40.500 --> 02:42:41.311
<v Speaker 2>I'm not doing it.</v>

5711
02:42:41.311 --> 02:42:42.990
<v Speaker 2>I have no time and I have no interest.</v>

5712
02:42:43.230 --> 02:42:43.531
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

5713
02:42:43.531 --> 02:42:44.640
<v Speaker 2>I just sort of prove my point.</v>

5714
02:42:45.180 --> 02:42:45.361
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

5715
02:42:45.361 --> 02:42:45.631
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

5716
02:42:45.631 --> 02:42:46.830
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know.</v>

5717
02:42:46.850 --> 02:42:49.050
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of people like to walk around to and say,</v>

5718
02:42:49.051 --> 02:42:49.231
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

5719
02:42:49.231 --> 02:42:51.180
<v Speaker 2>I learned another language and who's testing it?</v>

5720
02:42:51.181 --> 02:42:52.230
<v Speaker 2>I'm not testing their theory.</v>

5721
02:42:52.231 --> 02:42:52.471
<v Speaker 2>I'll go,</v>

5722
02:42:52.471 --> 02:42:52.771
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

5723
02:42:52.771 --> 02:42:53.101
<v Speaker 2>fine.</v>

5724
02:42:53.101 --> 02:42:53.460
<v Speaker 2>You can,</v>

5725
02:42:53.460 --> 02:42:55.560
<v Speaker 2>you can tell somebody you're hungry in another language.</v>

5726
02:42:55.561 --> 02:42:55.801
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>

5727
02:42:55.801 --> 02:42:56.634
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>

5728
02:42:56.730 --> 02:42:57.061
<v Speaker 2>Who's,</v>

5729
02:42:57.061 --> 02:42:58.680
<v Speaker 2>who's really patrolling that?</v>

5730
02:42:58.920 --> 02:42:59.610
<v Speaker 2>What does it commit?</v>

5731
02:42:59.610 --> 02:43:00.690
<v Speaker 2>Canadian comedian,</v>

5732
02:43:00.691 --> 02:43:01.650
<v Speaker 2>I don't know his name,</v>

5733
02:43:01.651 --> 02:43:02.041
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

5734
02:43:02.041 --> 02:43:03.720
<v Speaker 2>he learned Chinese,</v>

5735
02:43:04.020 --> 02:43:05.000
<v Speaker 2>learned Mandarin.</v>

5736
02:43:05.240 --> 02:43:06.073
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

5737
02:43:06.150 --> 02:43:10.530
<v Speaker 2>and went to China and started doing standup in Chinese and there was a video</v>

5738
02:43:10.531 --> 02:43:11.470
<v Speaker 2>that they put online.</v>

5739
02:43:11.471 --> 02:43:12.760
<v Speaker 2>It was fascinating</v>

5740
02:43:13.000 --> 02:43:14.110
<v Speaker 1>because the white guy.</v>

5741
02:43:14.170 --> 02:43:14.471
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5742
02:43:14.471 --> 02:43:15.304
<v Speaker 1>White Guy.</v>

5743
02:43:15.390 --> 02:43:16.690
<v Speaker 1>The accident was a main,</v>

5744
02:43:17.200 --> 02:43:17.591
<v Speaker 1>obviously,</v>

5745
02:43:17.591 --> 02:43:19.360
<v Speaker 1>I don't know whether or not he's saying they're right,</v>

5746
02:43:19.420 --> 02:43:20.750
<v Speaker 1>but the bloody tone child,</v>

5747
02:43:21.330 --> 02:43:24.790
<v Speaker 1>and he was talking like he was from China.</v>

5748
02:43:24.850 --> 02:43:25.331
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure.</v>

5749
02:43:25.331 --> 02:43:28.810
<v Speaker 5>I mean if you're going to put somebody in it into a test to figure out if</v>

5750
02:43:28.811 --> 02:43:30.040
<v Speaker 5>they're actually fluent in the language,</v>

5751
02:43:30.041 --> 02:43:32.350
<v Speaker 5>put him on a stage in front of a bunch of people and see if he can make them</v>

5752
02:43:32.351 --> 02:43:33.040
<v Speaker 5>laugh.</v>

5753
02:43:33.040 --> 02:43:33.311
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>

5754
02:43:33.311 --> 02:43:33.571
<v Speaker 5>Like if,</v>

5755
02:43:33.571 --> 02:43:35.560
<v Speaker 5>if the guy was able to put that together,</v>

5756
02:43:35.561 --> 02:43:36.730
<v Speaker 5>I'd say he's probably pretty fluent.</v>

5757
02:43:36.890 --> 02:43:37.161
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

5758
02:43:37.161 --> 02:43:40.460
<v Speaker 1>I think it was also like a situation where he just recognized that there was a</v>

5759
02:43:40.461 --> 02:43:42.500
<v Speaker 1>big market that wasn't being tapped into it.</v>

5760
02:43:42.530 --> 02:43:42.770
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

5761
02:43:42.770 --> 02:43:44.540
<v Speaker 1>Like here's millions of people.</v>

5762
02:43:44.660 --> 02:43:46.160
<v Speaker 1>They have this new freedom now.</v>

5763
02:43:46.190 --> 02:43:47.023
<v Speaker 1>Billions.</v>

5764
02:43:47.150 --> 02:43:47.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5765
02:43:47.660 --> 02:43:48.493
<v Speaker 1>Billion.</v>

5766
02:43:48.620 --> 02:43:50.450
<v Speaker 1>How many billions are in China's one?</v>

5767
02:43:50.540 --> 02:43:51.373
<v Speaker 1>At least one,</v>

5768
02:43:51.610 --> 02:43:52.100
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

5769
02:43:52.100 --> 02:43:52.641
<v Speaker 1>At least one.</v>

5770
02:43:52.641 --> 02:43:52.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5771
02:43:52.910 --> 02:43:57.050
<v Speaker 1>So all these people that don't have access to stand up comedy,</v>

5772
02:43:57.290 --> 02:43:57.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5773
02:43:57.770 --> 02:43:58.790
<v Speaker 1>and their language really.</v>

5774
02:43:58.791 --> 02:44:00.920
<v Speaker 1>There's no such thing as Chinese standup comedy.</v>

5775
02:44:00.950 --> 02:44:02.510
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say there's no such thing,</v>

5776
02:44:02.511 --> 02:44:05.870
<v Speaker 1>but it's certainly not nearly as popular as English speaking.</v>

5777
02:44:05.871 --> 02:44:07.130
<v Speaker 1>Comedy isn't Canada.</v>

5778
02:44:07.340 --> 02:44:10.200
<v Speaker 1>So there's a lot of Goddamn Canadian comedian.</v>

5779
02:44:10.201 --> 02:44:10.851
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>

5780
02:44:10.851 --> 02:44:14.060
<v Speaker 1>if you wanted to learn stand up comedy and you wanted to perform it in Canada,</v>

5781
02:44:14.270 --> 02:44:14.841
<v Speaker 1>there's many,</v>

5782
02:44:14.841 --> 02:44:15.021
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>

5783
02:44:15.021 --> 02:44:15.291
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>

5784
02:44:15.291 --> 02:44:16.370
<v Speaker 1>many venues.</v>

5785
02:44:16.400 --> 02:44:17.600
<v Speaker 1>Many places do it of course,</v>

5786
02:44:17.720 --> 02:44:19.940
<v Speaker 1>but there's also many comedians.</v>

5787
02:44:20.180 --> 02:44:23.360
<v Speaker 1>Whereas if you wanted to learn Chinese and just tap,</v>

5788
02:44:23.361 --> 02:44:27.620
<v Speaker 1>I mean maybe his motivational learning Chinese was totally unrelated to his</v>

5789
02:44:27.860 --> 02:44:29.940
<v Speaker 1>doing standup and Jamie might be just person.</v>

5790
02:44:29.941 --> 02:44:32.630
<v Speaker 1>Like my friend John was like super intro into languages.</v>

5791
02:44:32.631 --> 02:44:34.010
<v Speaker 1>He spoke five different languages.</v>

5792
02:44:34.011 --> 02:44:37.820
<v Speaker 1>He just loved learning languages and he would practice them with people that you</v>

5793
02:44:37.821 --> 02:44:38.000
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

5794
02:44:38.000 --> 02:44:38.833
<v Speaker 1>spoke it.</v>

5795
02:44:38.900 --> 02:44:39.800
<v Speaker 1>It could be that,</v>

5796
02:44:40.040 --> 02:44:43.130
<v Speaker 1>but also it's like the amount of competition that you have over there.</v>

5797
02:44:43.131 --> 02:44:44.090
<v Speaker 1>It's probably none.</v>

5798
02:44:44.540 --> 02:44:45.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5799
02:44:45.030 --> 02:44:45.560
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't help.</v>

5800
02:44:45.560 --> 02:44:46.393
<v Speaker 1>Advantage</v>

5801
02:44:46.980 --> 02:44:49.220
<v Speaker 5>usually advantage to being white over there in general.</v>

5802
02:44:49.250 --> 02:44:52.370
<v Speaker 5>I know a couple of buddies went over there to teach English in Korea mean it's</v>

5803
02:44:52.371 --> 02:44:53.900
<v Speaker 5>like you're a stud,</v>

5804
02:44:53.990 --> 02:44:54.860
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5805
02:44:54.900 --> 02:44:55.431
<v Speaker 5>because you're the,</v>

5806
02:44:55.431 --> 02:44:56.264
<v Speaker 5>you're the guy.</v>

5807
02:44:56.420 --> 02:44:56.871
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>

5808
02:44:56.871 --> 02:44:59.330
<v Speaker 5>You're the guy that they see on TV,</v>

5809
02:44:59.331 --> 02:44:59.571
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5810
02:44:59.571 --> 02:45:00.070
<v Speaker 5>you're you,</v>

5811
02:45:00.070 --> 02:45:00.311
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

5812
02:45:00.311 --> 02:45:01.490
<v Speaker 5>you're Tom Cruise for a minute.</v>

5813
02:45:02.090 --> 02:45:02.840
<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>

5814
02:45:02.840 --> 02:45:03.111
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

5815
02:45:03.111 --> 02:45:05.910
<v Speaker 5>because they're really homogenous society.</v>

5816
02:45:05.911 --> 02:45:06.111
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>

5817
02:45:06.111 --> 02:45:06.921
<v Speaker 5>you're walking around Japan,</v>

5818
02:45:06.921 --> 02:45:08.870
<v Speaker 5>you're not seeing this mixed,</v>

5819
02:45:09.140 --> 02:45:11.750
<v Speaker 5>this mix up of ethnicity that you have in North America.</v>

5820
02:45:11.780 --> 02:45:12.613
<v Speaker 5>We have,</v>

5821
02:45:12.770 --> 02:45:16.850
<v Speaker 5>we have a very strange cultural experience compared to the rest of the world.</v>

5822
02:45:17.560 --> 02:45:17.891
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5823
02:45:17.891 --> 02:45:19.060
<v Speaker 1>that Kinda makes sense.</v>

5824
02:45:19.550 --> 02:45:22.750
<v Speaker 1>It kind of makes sense in the fact that there's so much content.</v>

5825
02:45:22.780 --> 02:45:23.470
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

5826
02:45:23.470 --> 02:45:25.180
<v Speaker 1>that gets distributed by Americans,</v>

5827
02:45:25.330 --> 02:45:26.980
<v Speaker 1>but that's also why it's really crazy.</v>

5828
02:45:26.981 --> 02:45:27.920
<v Speaker 1>And Korea where they,</v>

5829
02:45:27.970 --> 02:45:32.500
<v Speaker 1>the amount of people getting surgery to change their appearance to a western</v>

5830
02:45:32.501 --> 02:45:33.040
<v Speaker 1>appearance.</v>

5831
02:45:33.040 --> 02:45:33.820
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

5832
02:45:33.820 --> 02:45:34.810
<v Speaker 1>Whew.</v>

5833
02:45:35.110 --> 02:45:35.591
<v Speaker 1>Boy,</v>

5834
02:45:35.591 --> 02:45:37.480
<v Speaker 1>we've gotten into it a few times on the podcast.</v>

5835
02:45:37.481 --> 02:45:40.430
<v Speaker 1>We won't get into it again cause he shared a bunch of links and a bunch of</v>

5836
02:45:40.480 --> 02:45:40.991
<v Speaker 1>images,</v>

5837
02:45:40.991 --> 02:45:45.991
<v Speaker 1>but it's apparently as popular as like braces and I don't like that people get</v>

5838
02:45:46.511 --> 02:45:48.150
<v Speaker 1>like some serious planning.</v>

5839
02:45:48.180 --> 02:45:49.380
<v Speaker 5>It's in India.</v>

5843
02:45:53.861 --> 02:45:54.090
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

5844
02:45:54.090 --> 02:45:56.020
<v Speaker 1>those places they use some sort of a,</v>

5845
02:45:56.021 --> 02:45:58.180
<v Speaker 1>an injection that a,</v>

5846
02:45:58.590 --> 02:45:59.410
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

5847
02:45:59.410 --> 02:45:59.981
<v Speaker 1>chemical,</v>

5848
02:45:59.981 --> 02:46:00.730
<v Speaker 1>hold on a second.</v>

5849
02:46:00.730 --> 02:46:02.230
<v Speaker 1>I've said it before and I know what it is.</v>

5850
02:46:02.231 --> 02:46:03.370
<v Speaker 1>Halapens they do it.</v>

5851
02:46:03.371 --> 02:46:03.681
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5852
02:46:03.681 --> 02:46:03.920
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

02:46:04.571 --> 02:46:05.860
<v Speaker 1>Lighter skin.</v>

5856
02:46:06.100 --> 02:46:07.210
<v Speaker 1>I forget what it's called.</v>

5857
02:46:07.450 --> 02:46:10.010
<v Speaker 1>It's actually also an amino or something like that.</v>

5858
02:46:10.240 --> 02:46:10.521
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5859
02:46:10.521 --> 02:46:10.920
<v Speaker 1>But it's,</v>

5860
02:46:10.920 --> 02:46:11.541
<v Speaker 1>it's harmful.</v>

5861
02:46:11.541 --> 02:46:12.374
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

5862
02:46:12.500 --> 02:46:12.921
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

5863
02:46:12.921 --> 02:46:13.161
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

5864
02:46:13.161 --> 02:46:15.860
<v Speaker 1>it's actually a good thing for you.</v>

5865
02:46:15.861 --> 02:46:17.030
<v Speaker 1>It's like healthy.</v>

5866
02:46:17.080 --> 02:46:17.390
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

5867
02:46:17.390 --> 02:46:21.470
<v Speaker 1>if you take it like as a dietary supplement with the fuck is it called</v>

5868
02:46:21.650 --> 02:46:23.540
<v Speaker 1>Glutathione Glutathione,</v>

5869
02:46:23.810 --> 02:46:28.810
<v Speaker 1>which is a glutathione is what is it I'm originally used for,</v>

5870
02:46:30.021 --> 02:46:31.370
<v Speaker 1>I forget what it's originally used for,</v>

5871
02:46:31.520 --> 02:46:36.520
<v Speaker 1>but it's also been shown to aid in the body's absorption of alcohol.</v>

5872
02:46:36.980 --> 02:46:38.930
<v Speaker 1>So a Dr. Mark Gordon,</v>

5873
02:46:38.931 --> 02:46:43.250
<v Speaker 1>who had been on my podcast before told me that it would greatly decrease the</v>

5874
02:46:43.251 --> 02:46:45.650
<v Speaker 1>effect that alcohol has on your body.</v>

5875
02:46:45.910 --> 02:46:50.910
<v Speaker 1>That glue to thigh own ha helps in some way to digest alcohol.</v>

5876
02:46:51.440 --> 02:46:53.300
<v Speaker 1>It's an antioxidant and plants,</v>

5877
02:46:53.301 --> 02:46:53.811
<v Speaker 1>animals,</v>

5878
02:46:53.811 --> 02:46:56.030
<v Speaker 1>fungi and some bacteria,</v>

5879
02:46:56.230 --> 02:46:56.570
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5880
02:46:56.570 --> 02:47:01.570
<v Speaker 1>preventing damage to important cellular components caused by reactive oxygen</v>

5881
02:47:02.151 --> 02:47:04.790
<v Speaker 1>species such as free radicals and peroxides.</v>

5882
02:47:05.510 --> 02:47:07.250
<v Speaker 1>So I'm somehow or another,</v>

5883
02:47:07.251 --> 02:47:11.870
<v Speaker 1>they inject this stuff into their body and it makes you think,</v>

5884
02:47:12.180 --> 02:47:15.110
<v Speaker 1>it makes you turn more pale and some,</v>

5885
02:47:15.140 --> 02:47:16.480
<v Speaker 1>some strange weather and stuff.</v>

5886
02:47:16.490 --> 02:47:17.330
<v Speaker 1>Michael Jackson was on,</v>

5887
02:47:18.500 --> 02:47:21.680
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the fuck they do and actually have pills too.</v>

5888
02:47:23.270 --> 02:47:24.103

<v Speaker 1>how to Whiten your skin.</v>

5892
02:47:30.080 --> 02:47:30.980
<v Speaker 1>After eight weeks,</v>

5893
02:47:30.981 --> 02:47:35.270
<v Speaker 1>I managed to get my skin a few turns wider and also got rid of my freckles.</v>

5894
02:47:35.300 --> 02:47:35.661
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

02:47:36.381 --> 02:47:37.340
<v Speaker 1>What are you doing to your eyes?</v>

5897
02:47:37.760 --> 02:47:38.361
<v Speaker 1>What you're doing?</v>

5902
02:47:43.431 --> 02:47:48.431
<v Speaker 2>that's a really far into the spectrum kind of scenario in which you can,</v>

5903
02:47:50.090 --> 02:47:54.020
<v Speaker 2>you can immediately see the western influence on the rest of the world in a</v>

5904
02:47:54.021 --> 02:47:54.860
<v Speaker 2>physical way.</v>

5905
02:47:54.910 --> 02:47:55.061
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

5906
02:47:55.061 --> 02:47:56.260
<v Speaker 1>how about people that Tan though?</v>

5907
02:47:56.850 --> 02:47:58.480
<v Speaker 1>What about people that get nutty and they,</v>

5908
02:47:58.660 --> 02:48:00.490
<v Speaker 1>they don't feel comfortable unless they're super,</v>

5909
02:48:00.491 --> 02:48:01.870
<v Speaker 1>Super Tan it.</v>

5910
02:48:01.871 --> 02:48:02.500
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

5911
02:48:02.500 --> 02:48:04.660
<v Speaker 1>is that how many people are into that?</v>

5912
02:48:04.810 --> 02:48:05.610
<v Speaker 1>A lot.</v>

5913
02:48:05.610 --> 02:48:05.801
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5914
02:48:05.801 --> 02:48:07.710
<v Speaker 2>I remember that Tam Ladies Tanning.</v>

5915
02:48:07.830 --> 02:48:09.690
<v Speaker 2>Remember that Tan lady that was on TV?</v>

5916
02:48:09.840 --> 02:48:12.300
<v Speaker 2>She was like insanely dark.</v>

5917
02:48:12.800 --> 02:48:13.001

<v Speaker 2>Her daughter do.</v>

5920
02:48:16.290 --> 02:48:19.440
<v Speaker 2>Is there such a thing as white people trying to look like some other race?</v>

5921
02:48:19.650 --> 02:48:22.050
<v Speaker 2>There's such a thing as white people trying to look darker for sure.</v>

5922
02:48:22.080 --> 02:48:22.711
<v Speaker 2>Well darker,</v>

5923
02:48:22.711 --> 02:48:24.460
<v Speaker 2>but you know what I mean.</v>

5924
02:48:24.461 --> 02:48:27.090
<v Speaker 2>Like I surgeries or I fuck I guess everyone,</v>

5925
02:48:27.120 --> 02:48:30.270
<v Speaker 2>well Brazilian guy just got an operation recently to look Korean.</v>

5926
02:48:30.540 --> 02:48:31.410
<v Speaker 2>Get the fuck out of here.</v>

5927
02:48:31.550 --> 02:48:31.981
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5928
02:48:31.981 --> 02:48:33.090
<v Speaker 2>it was big news piece.</v>

5929
02:48:33.230 --> 02:48:33.670
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

5930
02:48:33.670 --> 02:48:36.600
<v Speaker 2>But people on the planet,</v>

5931
02:48:36.601 --> 02:48:39.930
<v Speaker 2>I guess every for sure everyone's tried something only they tried it.</v>

5932
02:48:39.931 --> 02:48:41.250
<v Speaker 2>There's probably a forum about it.</v>

5933
02:48:41.490 --> 02:48:42.060
<v Speaker 2>Reddit sub.</v>

5934
02:48:42.060 --> 02:48:42.893
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5935
02:48:44.580 --> 02:48:46.140
<v Speaker 2>Nasty look.</v>

5936
02:48:46.141 --> 02:48:46.810
<v Speaker 2>People are,</v>

5937
02:48:46.810 --> 02:48:48.960
<v Speaker 2>and also it's like what we're talking about before,</v>

5938
02:48:48.961 --> 02:48:50.040
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of people that are just not,</v>

5939
02:48:50.280 --> 02:48:51.660
<v Speaker 2>they're not comfortable with who they are.</v>

5940
02:48:51.720 --> 02:48:51.931
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5941
02:48:51.931 --> 02:48:54.810
<v Speaker 2>So they think that maybe if I look Korean I'd feel better.</v>

5942
02:48:55.110 --> 02:48:56.940
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I suppose a few shades whiter,</v>

5943
02:48:57.240 --> 02:48:58.020
<v Speaker 2>I'd feel better.</v>

5944
02:48:58.020 --> 02:48:58.853
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

5945
02:48:59.290 --> 02:49:04.290
<v Speaker 2>I think it gets particularly strange or interesting when it's a huge group of</v>

5946
02:49:05.911 --> 02:49:07.200
<v Speaker 2>people that are doing it right.</v>

5947
02:49:07.201 --> 02:49:08.034
<v Speaker 2>I mean when you have,</v>

5948
02:49:08.280 --> 02:49:09.210
<v Speaker 2>when you have a trend,</v>

5949
02:49:09.570 --> 02:49:10.620
<v Speaker 2>when it sort of changes.</v>

5950
02:49:11.390 --> 02:49:11.601
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5951
02:49:11.601 --> 02:49:13.430
<v Speaker 1>And that's also what we're talking about.</v>

5952
02:49:13.431 --> 02:49:15.290
<v Speaker 1>It's like where's the content coming from?</v>

5953
02:49:15.291 --> 02:49:16.520
<v Speaker 1>Most of it's from the West.</v>

5954
02:49:16.530 --> 02:49:17.350
<v Speaker 1>So this,</v>

5955
02:49:17.350 --> 02:49:17.600
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

5956
02:49:17.600 --> 02:49:21.530
<v Speaker 1>these features is Brad Pitt face that you're seeing on your big screen over and</v>

5957
02:49:21.531 --> 02:49:22.141
<v Speaker 1>over again.</v>

5958
02:49:22.141 --> 02:49:23.660
<v Speaker 1>And sort of making you want,</v>

5959
02:49:23.690 --> 02:49:25.820
<v Speaker 1>why are my eyes so small?</v>

5960
02:49:27.520 --> 02:49:30.540
<v Speaker 2>But the physical manifestation of influence,</v>

5961
02:49:30.690 --> 02:49:32.280
<v Speaker 2>the physical manifestation.</v>

5962
02:49:32.310 --> 02:49:32.820
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

5963
02:49:32.820 --> 02:49:35.610
<v Speaker 2>But isn't it all the physical manifestation of influence when it comes to like</v>

5964
02:49:35.760 --> 02:49:36.870
<v Speaker 2>cultural ideas?</v>

5965
02:49:37.750 --> 02:49:38.790
<v Speaker 2>What do you choose to wear?</v>

5966
02:49:38.791 --> 02:49:39.530
<v Speaker 2>What are your clothes?</v>

5967
02:49:39.530 --> 02:49:40.920
<v Speaker 2>How about you put a plate in your lip?</v>

5968
02:49:40.950 --> 02:49:41.190
<v Speaker 2>Who,</v>

5969
02:49:41.190 --> 02:49:42.180
<v Speaker 2>how'd that get started?</v>

5970
02:49:42.330 --> 02:49:43.860
<v Speaker 2>How you got to bone through your nose?</v>

5971
02:49:43.920 --> 02:49:45.690
<v Speaker 2>Who the fuck else has a violence with their nose?</v>

5972
02:49:45.990 --> 02:49:46.830
<v Speaker 2>Is that your thing?</v>

5973
02:49:46.920 --> 02:49:47.570
<v Speaker 2>You the only guy?</v>

5974
02:49:47.570 --> 02:49:47.820
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

5975
02:49:47.820 --> 02:49:48.570
<v Speaker 2>it's a tradition.</v>

5976
02:49:48.570 --> 02:49:48.741
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

5977

02:49:49.410 --> 02:49:49.951
<v Speaker 2>We look great.</v>

5979
02:49:49.951 --> 02:49:50.710
<v Speaker 2>We have bones in their nose.</v>

5980
02:49:50.710 --> 02:49:51.870
<v Speaker 2>You do not look great.</v>

5981
02:49:51.900 --> 02:49:52.733
<v Speaker 2>Come here.</v>

5982
02:49:52.830 --> 02:49:53.041
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5983
02:49:53.041 --> 02:49:56.040
<v Speaker 2>So ultimately we all do things because of other people and what they're doing.</v>

5984
02:49:56.160 --> 02:49:56.670
<v Speaker 2>Well there was</v>

5985
02:49:56.670 --> 02:50:00.270
<v Speaker 1>thing on this television show where this guy was going to,</v>

5986
02:50:00.310 --> 02:50:03.830
<v Speaker 1>this guy was going to Africa and um,</v>

5987
02:50:03.870 --> 02:50:08.870
<v Speaker 1>he was visiting with these people that are regularly being around crocodiles and</v>

5988
02:50:09.631 --> 02:50:14.180
<v Speaker 1>they have these markings that they see the scar there skin in the form of</v>

5989
02:50:14.190 --> 02:50:19.190
<v Speaker 1>crocodile crocodile ridges and they have across their bodies really crazy shit.</v>

5990
02:50:19.831 --> 02:50:20.161
<v Speaker 1>And they,</v>

5991
02:50:20.161 --> 02:50:22.770
<v Speaker 1>they sort of mimic the skin of a crocodile.</v>

5992
02:50:22.890 --> 02:50:23.370
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

5993
02:50:23.370 --> 02:50:23.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5994
02:50:23.970 --> 02:50:24.570
<v Speaker 1>What's the,</v>

5995
02:50:24.570 --> 02:50:25.100
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

5996
02:50:25.100 --> 02:50:29.910
<v Speaker 1>Just what I'm coming of age thing with men and they do this and it sort of</v>

5997
02:50:29.911 --> 02:50:31.890
<v Speaker 1>represents strength and they cover themselves.</v>

5998
02:50:31.891 --> 02:50:32.160
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

5999
02:50:32.160 --> 02:50:33.420
<v Speaker 1>these crocodiles scars.</v>

6000
02:50:33.820 --> 02:50:38.070
<v Speaker 1>It was so weird to look at these key Lloyd scars all around this guy's body and</v>

6001
02:50:38.071 --> 02:50:40.560
<v Speaker 1>this somehow or another become a part of their culture,</v>

6002
02:50:40.890 --> 02:50:45.890
<v Speaker 1>like war paint or weird facial pain or how about what we think of as normal when</v>

6003
02:50:47.071 --> 02:50:52.071
<v Speaker 1>a woman wears ridiculous lipstick and blue colored eyeliner and you know,</v>

6004
02:50:52.600 --> 02:50:53.830
<v Speaker 2>Lash to say,</v>

6005
02:50:53.831 --> 02:50:56.500
<v Speaker 2>I'm happy as hell that that's not us.</v>

6006
02:50:57.030 --> 02:50:58.150
<v Speaker 2>We don't have sex.</v>

6007
02:50:58.770 --> 02:51:00.370
<v Speaker 2>If you've ever watched it going down</v>

6008
02:51:04.000 --> 02:51:05.210
<v Speaker 2>like a fucking assault,</v>

6009
02:51:05.800 --> 02:51:08.170
<v Speaker 2>like a woman's getting beat up by her makeup,</v>

6010
02:51:08.171 --> 02:51:09.130
<v Speaker 2>your watch going down,</v>

6011
02:51:09.131 --> 02:51:09.311
<v Speaker 2>Bro,</v>

6012
02:51:09.311 --> 02:51:10.144
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to watch.</v>

6013
02:51:11.200 --> 02:51:11.651
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

6014
02:51:11.651 --> 02:51:14.140
<v Speaker 2>You can't just get out of bed and get to your shit.</v>

6015
02:51:14.440 --> 02:51:16.300
<v Speaker 2>Can't just move on with your life.</v>

6016
02:51:16.430 --> 02:51:17.770
<v Speaker 2>Like I put no thought.</v>

6017
02:51:17.800 --> 02:51:18.101
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

6018
02:51:18.101 --> 02:51:18.341
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

6019
02:51:18.341 --> 02:51:18.761
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

6020
02:51:18.761 --> 02:51:21.580
<v Speaker 2>I mean I got to look in the mirror and make sure I'm not fucked up or for some</v>

6021
02:51:21.581 --> 02:51:21.851
<v Speaker 2>reason,</v>

6022
02:51:21.851 --> 02:51:22.061
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6023
02:51:22.061 --> 02:51:26.170
<v Speaker 2>but the idea that there's preparation just to leave the house,</v>

6024
02:51:27.010 --> 02:51:29.230
<v Speaker 2>facial preparation and</v>

6025
02:51:29.470 --> 02:51:30.130
<v Speaker 1>women,</v>

6026
02:51:30.130 --> 02:51:33.460
<v Speaker 1>if they don't have their makeup on and another girl is around and she has her</v>

6027
02:51:33.461 --> 02:51:34.031
<v Speaker 1>makeup on,</v>

6028
02:51:34.031 --> 02:51:34.930
<v Speaker 1>they get like upset.</v>

6029
02:51:35.150 --> 02:51:35.961
<v Speaker 2>Oh my gosh,</v>

02:51:35.961 --> 02:51:38.950
<v Speaker 2>how am I fucking makeup on and put my makeup on?</v>

6031
02:51:38.960 --> 02:51:42.300
<v Speaker 2>You should've told me that she has her makeup on crazy colors.</v>

6032
02:51:42.301 --> 02:51:43.200
<v Speaker 2>Like from space.</v>

6033
02:51:43.590 --> 02:51:44.520
<v Speaker 2>We'll get her eyes.</v>

6034
02:51:44.580 --> 02:51:45.391
<v Speaker 2>She closes her eyes.</v>

6035
02:51:45.391 --> 02:51:46.224
<v Speaker 2>She see the heavens.</v>

6036
02:51:46.230 --> 02:51:48.240
<v Speaker 2>She's winning in her eyelids.</v>

6037
02:51:48.250 --> 02:51:49.230
<v Speaker 2>Eight goddammit.</v>

6038
02:51:49.231 --> 02:51:50.190
<v Speaker 2>Her skin is perfect.</v>

6039
02:51:50.191 --> 02:51:51.630
<v Speaker 2>It's covered in fucking powder.</v>

6040
02:51:51.700 --> 02:51:53.040
<v Speaker 2>How is their skin colored?</v>

6041
02:51:53.041 --> 02:51:53.820
<v Speaker 2>Powder all over.</v>

6042
02:51:53.820 --> 02:51:53.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6043
02:51:53.980 --> 02:51:54.601
<v Speaker 2>We lucked out,</v>

6044
02:51:54.601 --> 02:51:54.751
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

02:51:54.751 --> 02:51:55.680
<v Speaker 2>We let her nails.</v>

6046
02:51:55.710 --> 02:52:00.710
<v Speaker 2>We lucked out in all kinds of areas except how about urinating?</v>

6047
02:52:01.570 --> 02:52:02.050
<v Speaker 2>Awesome.</v>

6048
02:52:02.050 --> 02:52:03.730
<v Speaker 1>Except we dine wore more often.</v>

6049
02:52:03.920 --> 02:52:04.251
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

6050
02:52:04.251 --> 02:52:04.451
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

6051
02:52:04.451 --> 02:52:04.781
<v Speaker 1>we have,</v>

6052
02:52:04.781 --> 02:52:06.400
<v Speaker 1>jobs are far more dangerous.</v>

6053
02:52:06.401 --> 02:52:07.990
<v Speaker 1>We're more likely to be murdered.</v>

6054
02:52:08.020 --> 02:52:08.620
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

6055
02:52:08.620 --> 02:52:09.840
<v Speaker 1>A lot of shit that's not so hot.</v>

6056
02:52:09.841 --> 02:52:10.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

6057
02:52:10.140 --> 02:52:10.590
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

6058
02:52:10.590 --> 02:52:11.190
<v Speaker 5>You know what?</v>

6059
02:52:11.190 --> 02:52:13.830
<v Speaker 5>You know what else you hadn't that you have to be tough to a degree.</v>

6060
02:52:14.130 --> 02:52:14.850
<v Speaker 5>Like you think so,</v>

6061
02:52:14.850 --> 02:52:15.331
<v Speaker 5>well let's,</v>

6062
02:52:15.331 --> 02:52:16.164
<v Speaker 5>let's put it this way,</v>

6063
02:52:16.280 --> 02:52:17.340
<v Speaker 5>but let's say,</v>

6064
02:52:17.460 --> 02:52:17.820
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

6065
02:52:17.820 --> 02:52:18.653
<v Speaker 5>growing up,</v>

6066
02:52:19.200 --> 02:52:19.561
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

6067
02:52:19.561 --> 02:52:23.280
<v Speaker 5>there's going to be circumstances in which you could be physically threatened</v>

6068
02:52:23.281 --> 02:52:25.680
<v Speaker 5>and that's socially acceptable for a woman.</v>

6069
02:52:25.681 --> 02:52:26.610
<v Speaker 5>It's really never,</v>

6070
02:52:27.120 --> 02:52:27.660
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

6071
02:52:27.660 --> 02:52:29.780
<v Speaker 5>unless you being threatened by another woman or,</v>

6072
02:52:29.781 --> 02:52:31.770
<v Speaker 5>or unless it's like an actual crime,</v>

6073
02:52:31.980 --> 02:52:35.400
<v Speaker 5>but if two boys who are 10 years old decided to Duke it out,</v>

6074
02:52:35.401 --> 02:52:36.234
<v Speaker 5>it's not a crime.</v>

6075
02:52:36.430 --> 02:52:36.791
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

6076
02:52:36.791 --> 02:52:41.320
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a lot of it is there's a real problem with people and,</v>

6077
02:52:41.410 --> 02:52:44.260
<v Speaker 1>and violent interactions that could,</v>

6078
02:52:44.261 --> 02:52:48.220
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the problems could be resolved with the introduction of martial arts</v>

6079
02:52:48.250 --> 02:52:49.190
<v Speaker 1>early in people's lives,</v>

6080
02:52:49.191 --> 02:52:49.660
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

6081
02:52:49.660 --> 02:52:51.940
<v Speaker 1>Like the amount of actual violence that you see,</v>

6082
02:52:52.110 --> 02:52:52.943
<v Speaker 5>like</v>

6083
02:52:55.200 --> 02:52:58.680
<v Speaker 1>other than sparring and an actual martial arts environment is almost</v>

6084
02:52:59.120 --> 02:52:59.953
<v Speaker 1>nonexistent.</v>

6085
02:53:00.120 --> 02:53:00.691
<v Speaker 1>It's very,</v>

6086
02:53:00.691 --> 02:53:02.070
<v Speaker 1>very rare and rare.</v>

6087
02:53:02.071 --> 02:53:02.431
<v Speaker 1>Jim,</v>

6088
02:53:02.431 --> 02:53:05.160
<v Speaker 1>we see people arguing or fighting most of the time.</v>

6089
02:53:05.190 --> 02:53:05.581
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

6090
02:53:05.581 --> 02:53:05.870
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

6091
02:53:05.870 --> 02:53:06.150
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

6092
02:53:06.150 --> 02:53:07.110
<v Speaker 1>you're getting it all out.</v>

6093
02:53:07.111 --> 02:53:08.280
<v Speaker 1>You getting it on your system.</v>

6094
02:53:08.380 --> 02:53:09.160
<v Speaker 5>I agree with that.</v>

6095
02:53:09.160 --> 02:53:13.900
<v Speaker 5>But I think what maybe what I should have said was this idea that a man needs to</v>

6096
02:53:13.901 --> 02:53:14.740
<v Speaker 5>stick up for himself.</v>

6097
02:53:14.770 --> 02:53:15.400
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

6098
02:53:15.400 --> 02:53:15.941
<v Speaker 5>Like all,</v>

6099
02:53:15.941 --> 02:53:16.540
<v Speaker 5>all this,</v>

6100
02:53:16.540 --> 02:53:16.731
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

6101
02:53:16.731 --> 02:53:18.760
<v Speaker 5>the dish Chicago stuff I was talking about earlier,</v>

6102
02:53:18.970 --> 02:53:21.910
<v Speaker 5>they had like 50 murders last month or something crazy.</v>

6103
02:53:21.940 --> 02:53:24.310
<v Speaker 5>And I'm guarantee they're all men shooting then.</v>

6104
02:53:24.340 --> 02:53:24.431
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

6105
02:53:24.431 --> 02:53:26.440
<v Speaker 5>but that's a poverty crime,</v>

6106
02:53:26.441 --> 02:53:27.100
<v Speaker 5>gangs,</v>

6107
02:53:27.100 --> 02:53:27.491
<v Speaker 5>drug.</v>

6108
02:53:27.491 --> 02:53:29.300
<v Speaker 5>What has the both sexes exist there?</v>

6109
02:53:29.380 --> 02:53:29.741
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

6110
02:53:29.741 --> 02:53:30.420
<v Speaker 1>that's true.</v>

6111
02:53:30.420 --> 02:53:33.520
<v Speaker 1>Well there's actually a lot of girls that are involved in gang crime as well.</v>

6112
02:53:33.530 --> 02:53:34.020
<v Speaker 1>Chicago,</v>

6113
02:53:34.020 --> 02:53:34.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure.</v>

6114
02:53:34.540 --> 02:53:37.840
<v Speaker 1>But it's a big article recently about this one girl died and she was like 19</v>

6115
02:53:37.841 --> 02:53:41.920
<v Speaker 1>years old and she had all these photos of her online with guns holding up guns</v>

6116
02:53:41.921 --> 02:53:42.910
<v Speaker 1>and shit making gangs.</v>

6117
02:53:42.911 --> 02:53:43.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure that's there too.</v>

6118
02:53:43.991 --> 02:53:45.620
