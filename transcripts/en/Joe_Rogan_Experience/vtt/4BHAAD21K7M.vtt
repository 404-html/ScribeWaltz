<v Speaker 2>what you can do with your,</v>

17
00:00:33.291 --> 00:00:33.470
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:34.303
<v Speaker 2>your account.</v>

19
00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:35.060

<v Speaker 2>No overage charges or penalties.</v>

25
00:00:41.691 --> 00:00:42.524
<v Speaker 2>If you lose,</v>

26
00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.170
<v Speaker 2>you used more time than you thought you would.</v>

27
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.130
<v Speaker 2>You just pay for what you used and credit on unused service.</v>

28
00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:50.960
<v Speaker 2>This is unheard of.</v>

29
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.050
<v Speaker 2>If you use less than you thought you would,</v>

30
00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.490
<v Speaker 2>10 drops you down to the level you hit and the credits that difference on your</v>

31
00:00:58.491 --> 00:00:59.000
<v Speaker 2>next bill.</v>

32
00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.211
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

33
00:00:59.211 --> 00:01:00.440
<v Speaker 2>that's fucking incredible.</v>

34
00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:01.460
<v Speaker 2>That has way too fair.</v>

35
00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:02.240
<v Speaker 2>It's beautiful.</v>

36
00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:03.020
<v Speaker 2>Nobody does that.</v>

37
00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.853
<v Speaker 2>It's such a thing.</v>

38
00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.530
<v Speaker 2>It's a really cool idea.</v>

39
00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.060
<v Speaker 2>It's like do business,</v>

40
00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.330
<v Speaker 2>but do it ethically and do it in a way where people aren't being fucked.</v>

41
00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.760
<v Speaker 2>It still going to get plenty of business.</v>

42
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.490
<v Speaker 2>There's 300 million goddamn people in this country.</v>

43
00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:17.600
<v Speaker 2>How many people do you need?</v>

44
00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:17.850
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

45
00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:18.480
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

46
00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:19.010
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

47
00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.610
<v Speaker 2>how much,</v>

48
00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:20.670
<v Speaker 2>how much money do you need?</v>

49
00:01:20.671 --> 00:01:22.940
<v Speaker 2>You wouldn't you feel happier if you had,</v>

50
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

51
00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:24.310
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

52
00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.590
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

53
00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:25.220
<v Speaker 2>enough.</v>

54
00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:25.790
<v Speaker 2>But it's,</v>

55
00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:26.541
<v Speaker 2>it feels good.</v>

56
00:01:26.541 --> 00:01:31.541
<v Speaker 2>Like you're doing everything you should be doing with a company providing an</v>

57
00:01:31.941 --> 00:01:32.691
<v Speaker 2>excellent service.</v>

58
00:01:32.691 --> 00:01:32.861
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

59
00:01:32.861 --> 00:01:34.070
<v Speaker 2>it's on the sprint backbone,</v>

60
00:01:34.071 --> 00:01:37.610
<v Speaker 2>one of the biggest cell phone services in the country and they use these awesome</v>

61
00:01:37.611 --> 00:01:37.911
<v Speaker 2>phones.</v>

62
00:01:37.911 --> 00:01:38.570
<v Speaker 2>They have these,</v>

63
00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:39.081
<v Speaker 2>I was telling you,</v>

64
00:01:39.081 --> 00:01:41.090
<v Speaker 2>the Samsung Galaxy s three,</v>

65
00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:42.411
<v Speaker 2>and they have the,</v>

66
00:01:42.411 --> 00:01:42.531
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

67
00:01:42.531 --> 00:01:44.360
<v Speaker 2>the note and the note to,</v>

68
00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.811
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

69
00:01:44.811 --> 00:01:46.160
<v Speaker 2>these things are insane.</v>

70
00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.851
<v Speaker 2>Isn't it?</v>

71
00:01:46.851 --> 00:01:47.241
<v Speaker 2>Crazy?</v>

72
00:01:47.241 --> 00:01:47.950
<v Speaker 2>Beautiful.</v>

73
00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:48.031
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

74
00:01:48.031 --> 00:01:48.950
<v Speaker 2>It gets some notes in this.</v>

75
00:01:48.951 --> 00:01:49.220
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

76
00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:50.120
<v Speaker 2>We need to get some notes.</v>

77
00:01:50.121 --> 00:01:51.290
<v Speaker 2>It makes me think the,</v>

78
00:01:51.291 --> 00:01:51.920
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

79
00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.910
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy when you hear that a company is so ethical that it makes you go like,</v>

80
00:01:55.911 --> 00:01:56.700
<v Speaker 2>what's going on?</v>

81
00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:56.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

82
00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:57.980
<v Speaker 2>You guys are the CIA.</v>

83
00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:00.260
<v Speaker 2>Why are you guys being on,</v>

84
00:02:00.261 --> 00:02:00.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

85
00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.360
<v Speaker 2>why am I doing so much sneaky shit?</v>

86
00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.380
<v Speaker 2>This is a real tendency with companies to try to make as much money as possible</v>

87
00:02:07.791 --> 00:02:09.260
<v Speaker 2>to maximize their profits,</v>

88
00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.981
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

89
00:02:09.981 --> 00:02:11.660
<v Speaker 2>and the more they maximize their profits,</v>

90
00:02:11.661 --> 00:02:14.090
<v Speaker 2>especially corporations who are dealing with many,</v>

91
00:02:14.091 --> 00:02:17.030
<v Speaker 2>many employees like who knows how many a hundred,</v>

92
00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.571
<v Speaker 2>a thousand,</v>

93
00:02:17.571 --> 00:02:18.404
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is.</v>

94
00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.670
<v Speaker 2>When you're dealing with all those people and if you want to maximize profit and</v>

95
00:02:21.671 --> 00:02:25.310
<v Speaker 2>they're trying to maximize profit collectively over a group of like hundreds of</v>

96
00:02:25.311 --> 00:02:27.050
<v Speaker 2>people where it makes an impact on either one of it,</v>

97
00:02:27.051 --> 00:02:28.370
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of fucking money involved.</v>

98
00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:29.203
<v Speaker 2>It's what I'm trying to say.</v>

99
00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.130
<v Speaker 2>And there's,</v>

100
00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.460
<v Speaker 2>there's got to be the correct ethics in place.</v>

101
00:02:34.461 --> 00:02:36.800
<v Speaker 2>And I think for a lot of companies in this country,</v>

102
00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:37.371
<v Speaker 2>they're not,</v>

103
00:02:37.371 --> 00:02:38.750
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of companies there,</v>

104
00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.060
<v Speaker 2>they're just trying to make as much money as possible.</v>

105
00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.820
<v Speaker 2>But smart people like Tang are saying,</v>

106
00:02:43.821 --> 00:02:44.570
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

107
00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:49.570
<v Speaker 2>you can make plenty of money and still be really fair and that's good money.</v>

108
00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:51.170
<v Speaker 2>That's the new concept.</v>

109
00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.850
<v Speaker 2>And it's a great concept.</v>

110
00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.660
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

111
00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:54.650
<v Speaker 2>the same with hover.</v>

112
00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:55.401
<v Speaker 2>Hover is,</v>

113
00:02:55.401 --> 00:02:56.234
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

114
00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.150
<v Speaker 2>a domain name company that is also owned by 10.</v>

115
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:00.610
<v Speaker 2>And they have sort of the same thing going on.</v>

116
00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:01.600
<v Speaker 2>It's beautiful.</v>

117
00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.800
<v Speaker 2>Go to [inaudible] dot [inaudible] dot com and you can get 25 bucks off of either</v>

118
00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.660
<v Speaker 2>one of their cell phones or service.</v>

119
00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:08.501
<v Speaker 2>And then like I said,</v>

120
00:03:08.501 --> 00:03:10.770
<v Speaker 2>they have top of the line android phone.</v>

121
00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:11.890
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty dope malicious.</v>

122
00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.360
<v Speaker 2>I used mine in Columbus,</v>

123
00:03:13.361 --> 00:03:16.750
<v Speaker 2>Ohio at work to everywhere actually worked better than my 18 t phones.</v>

124
00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:17.623
<v Speaker 2>I was using my,</v>

125
00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:18.170
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

126
00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.680
<v Speaker 2>I gotta tell you to,</v>

127
00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.680
<v Speaker 2>Joey loves sprint and he says the prince amazing.</v>

128
00:03:20.681 --> 00:03:25.090
<v Speaker 2>And I think sprint is probably commensurate with Verizon as far as the areas</v>

129
00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.700
<v Speaker 2>that you can use it because it's a CDMA,</v>

130
00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:28.241
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

131
00:03:28.241 --> 00:03:29.800
<v Speaker 2>I think CDMA is,</v>

132
00:03:29.801 --> 00:03:30.634
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

133
00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:31.241
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

134
00:03:31.241 --> 00:03:31.690
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

135
00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.940
<v Speaker 2>it's a different sort of a signal than GSM.</v>

136
00:03:33.941 --> 00:03:35.320
<v Speaker 2>That's why Verizon is so good.</v>

137
00:03:35.321 --> 00:03:39.280
<v Speaker 2>One of the reasons why it doesn't drop as much as like that CDMA can go like</v>

138
00:03:39.281 --> 00:03:40.570
<v Speaker 2>deep in the buildings and shit.</v>

139
00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:41.351
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>

140
00:03:41.351 --> 00:03:43.090
<v Speaker 2>apparently it's older technology,</v>

141
00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:44.890
<v Speaker 2>but it's a little bit stronger.</v>

142
00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:45.120
<v Speaker 2>Just,</v>

143
00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.240
<v Speaker 2>sorry to tell you one that has that one.</v>

144
00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.730
<v Speaker 2>Verizon and sprint or CDMA,</v>

145
00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.250
<v Speaker 2>whereas a t and t,</v>

146
00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:52.653
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

147
00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:53.651
<v Speaker 2>t-mobile,</v>

148
00:03:53.651 --> 00:03:54.484
<v Speaker 2>those are GSM.</v>

149
00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:55.740
<v Speaker 2>So it's different kinds of stuff.</v>

150
00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:56.350
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

151
00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:57.183
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.230

<v Speaker 2>all throughout England.</v>

158
00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.440
<v Speaker 2>If you have a Verizon phone and you go over to England,</v>

159
00:04:05.441 --> 00:04:06.190
<v Speaker 2>you're fucked.</v>

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.851
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

162
00:04:06.851 --> 00:04:08.470
<v Speaker 2>You have to get a world phone.</v>

163
00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:10.360
<v Speaker 2>It won't even work without that.</v>

164
00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:10.871
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

165
00:04:10.871 --> 00:04:12.430
<v Speaker 2>you have to get a world phone because if you,</v>

167
00:04:12.711 --> 00:04:14.080
<v Speaker 2>you're running on a CDMA signal.</v>

168
00:04:14.081 --> 00:04:15.850
<v Speaker 2>They don't use that old stupid shit.</v>

169
00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.810
<v Speaker 2>Oh really?</v>

170
00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:18.520
<v Speaker 2>It's only Americans that used that.</v>

171
00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:20.200
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand why it's better,</v>

172
00:04:20.201 --> 00:04:25.201
<v Speaker 2>but I do know that an 18 and t you can go online as well as,</v>

173
00:04:25.841 --> 00:04:26.300
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:27.700
<v Speaker 2>as as make a phone call.</v>

175
00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:28.990
<v Speaker 2>Like I could be talking to you.</v>

176
00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.670
<v Speaker 2>And then I said,</v>

177
00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.771
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

178
00:04:29.771 --> 00:04:31.600
<v Speaker 2>let me look it up real quick and I can say,</v>

179
00:04:31.601 --> 00:04:33.460
<v Speaker 2>hold on a second and while I'm on the phone with you,</v>

180
00:04:33.461 --> 00:04:35.260
<v Speaker 2>I can go on a website or Google.</v>

181
00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:37.450
<v Speaker 2>I can't do that with,</v>

182
00:04:37.451 --> 00:04:37.690
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

183
00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:38.560
<v Speaker 2>with Verizon.</v>

184
00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:39.280
<v Speaker 2>That sucks.</v>

185
00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:39.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

186
00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:42.670
<v Speaker 2>The only time you can do that I think is with the four g.</v>

187
00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:44.353
<v Speaker 2>That's a,</v>

188
00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:45.700
<v Speaker 2>I think that the four g's.</v>

189
00:04:45.701 --> 00:04:45.911

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:48.251
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>

193
00:04:48.251 --> 00:04:49.810
<v Speaker 2>Four G for Verizon to do,</v>

194
00:04:49.811 --> 00:04:52.780
<v Speaker 2>they allow you to make phone calls and access the Internet?</v>

195
00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.680
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

196
00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.460
<v Speaker 2>some of the devices I think does four g but only on four G.</v>

197
00:04:57.461 --> 00:04:57.890
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

198
00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:58.720

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

201
00:04:59.711 --> 00:05:01.300
<v Speaker 2>The iPhone is always a step behind.</v>

202
00:05:01.301 --> 00:05:02.890
<v Speaker 2>It was a step behind for the longest time.</v>

203
00:05:02.891 --> 00:05:04.390
<v Speaker 2>It was three g before it's four g.</v>

204
00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:07.210
<v Speaker 2>But you used to have to pay something.</v>

205
00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.940
<v Speaker 2>It used to cost if you want to get off the iPhone tit,</v>

206
00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:10.871
<v Speaker 2>like if you want it.</v>

213
00:05:21.941 --> 00:05:24.790
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't even a question of whether or not I was going to deal with it.</v>

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:25.661

295
00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.750
<v Speaker 2>They're also referred to as club bells.</v>

296
00:07:39.751 --> 00:07:41.010
<v Speaker 2>I use these all the time.</v>

297
00:07:41.011 --> 00:07:41.940
<v Speaker 2>They're fucking awesome.</v>

298
00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:44.160
<v Speaker 2>It's like a giant baseball bat,</v>

299
00:07:44.161 --> 00:07:45.120
<v Speaker 2>like a wiffle bat member.</v>

300
00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:47.640
<v Speaker 2>The fat wiffle bat that you would always try to grab because it was way better</v>

301
00:07:47.641 --> 00:07:49.320
<v Speaker 2>than a regular wiffle ball bat.</v>

302
00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:49.940
<v Speaker 2>Oh sure.</v>

303
00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:51.360
<v Speaker 2>Big Fat ones where you could really,</v>

304
00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:52.411
<v Speaker 2>that's what these are like,</v>

305
00:07:52.411 --> 00:07:54.390
<v Speaker 2>but they're made of iron and your,</v>

306
00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:57.810
<v Speaker 2>you do all these fucking crazy things called the shield cats with them and all</v>

307
00:07:57.811 --> 00:07:59.040
<v Speaker 2>these exercises with it.</v>

308
00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:00.170
<v Speaker 2>Persian guys do.</v>

309
00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:02.400
<v Speaker 2>The Iranian guys and Indian guys,</v>

310
00:08:02.401 --> 00:08:03.660
<v Speaker 2>a lot of Indian guys do it.</v>

311
00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:05.881
<v Speaker 2>Friends.</v>

312
00:08:05.881 --> 00:08:09.930
<v Speaker 2>Kids love you in the fucking new shit that we started selling at on it.</v>

313
00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:10.690
<v Speaker 2>It's uh,</v>

314
00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:10.931
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

315
00:08:10.931 --> 00:08:12.240
<v Speaker 2>we have kettle bells now.</v>

316
00:08:12.241 --> 00:08:13.110
<v Speaker 2>Battle ropes.</v>

317
00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:16.800
<v Speaker 2>We have an amazing kettle bell workout DVD.</v>

318
00:08:16.801 --> 00:08:19.140
<v Speaker 2>It's the extreme kettlebell cardio DVD.</v>

319
00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:19.610
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

320
00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:21.360
<v Speaker 2>if you are going to do that though,</v>

321
00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:24.850
<v Speaker 2>I would really suggest anybody that's interested in,</v>

322
00:08:24.851 --> 00:08:29.851
<v Speaker 2>in doing kettle bells or any particularly or possibly dangerous exercise,</v>

323
00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:33.780
<v Speaker 2>go and learn from a local guy.</v>

324
00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:37.860
<v Speaker 2>Find a local guy who's a professional instructor and Kettle Valley.</v>

325
00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:39.270
<v Speaker 2>It won't take much time.</v>

326
00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:40.410
<v Speaker 2>He can show you the,</v>

327
00:08:40.411 --> 00:08:42.750
<v Speaker 2>all the movements are fairly intuitive.</v>

328
00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:45.720
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure a guy would let you videotape it,</v>

329
00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:46.291
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

330
00:08:46.291 --> 00:08:46.431
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

331
00:08:46.431 --> 00:08:50.280
<v Speaker 2>and he could give you just some tips to make sure that you don't hurt yourself.</v>

332
00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:51.061
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

333
00:08:51.061 --> 00:08:51.251
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

334
00:08:51.251 --> 00:08:53.820
<v Speaker 2>I'm going through some back issues right now myself.</v>

335
00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:58.570
<v Speaker 2>Nothing like I can still kick box at 100%.</v>

336
00:08:58.571 --> 00:09:00.270
<v Speaker 2>I could still lift weights but,</v>

337
00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:01.960
<v Speaker 2>but I have some disc issues,</v>

338
00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:02.440
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

339
00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:02.950
<v Speaker 2>Oh sure.</v>

340
00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:03.611
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

341
00:09:03.611 --> 00:09:04.450
<v Speaker 2>a lot of that,</v>

342
00:09:04.930 --> 00:09:05.501
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

343
00:09:05.501 --> 00:09:06.040
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

344
00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:07.960
<v Speaker 2>it's going to happen if you do something like Jujitsu.</v>

345
00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:10.780
<v Speaker 2>But if you can avoid any kind of injury,</v>

346
00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:12.220
<v Speaker 2>you really should.</v>

347
00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:12.880
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

348
00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:15.580
<v Speaker 2>Anytime you can avoid any kind of injury you should.</v>

349
00:09:15.581 --> 00:09:20.581
<v Speaker 2>And the best way to avoid an injury with kettlebells is to use proper form and</v>

350
00:09:20.921 --> 00:09:23.390
<v Speaker 2>to learn from an instructor what kettle bells are.</v>

351
00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:24.370
<v Speaker 2>If you've never seen them before,</v>

352
00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:27.400
<v Speaker 2>it's a circular ball on the bottom,</v>

353
00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:28.540
<v Speaker 2>like the bell.</v>

354
00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:33.570
<v Speaker 2>It's made out of iron and it has a handle and it's a fic iron handle.</v>

355
00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:37.870
<v Speaker 2>And what you do with these things is you swing them around and you use your</v>

356
00:09:37.871 --> 00:09:42.871
<v Speaker 2>whole body to pick them up and it really engages your core and your legs and</v>

357
00:09:43.031 --> 00:09:48.031
<v Speaker 2>your arms in like really weird functional ways that help you like in real life,</v>

358
00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:52.870
<v Speaker 2>whether it's in athletics or whether it's in like just picking something up,</v>

359
00:09:52.871 --> 00:09:54.640
<v Speaker 2>the ability to pick something up and move it around your house,</v>

360
00:09:54.650 --> 00:09:57.040
<v Speaker 2>you'll have more strength of your whole body.</v>

361
00:09:57.490 --> 00:09:57.871
<v Speaker 2>Like A,</v>

362
00:09:57.871 --> 00:09:59.890
<v Speaker 2>I was hanging out with this dude really recently,</v>

363
00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:00.490
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

364
00:10:00.490 --> 00:10:02.260
<v Speaker 2>who was a bodybuilder guy,</v>

365
00:10:02.261 --> 00:10:03.970
<v Speaker 2>but he had like this little toothpick legs.</v>

366
00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:04.721
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

367
00:10:04.721 --> 00:10:08.060
<v Speaker 2>it's so crazy because all he's doing is like doing bench press and curls does,</v>

368
00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:08.950
<v Speaker 2>it makes you look good.</v>

369
00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:12.640
<v Speaker 2>But then he's got these toothpicks that are holding all that up because he's not</v>

370
00:10:12.641 --> 00:10:15.400
<v Speaker 2>using his whole body at the same time.</v>

371
00:10:15.401 --> 00:10:16.330
<v Speaker 2>You see that at every gym.</v>

372
00:10:16.331 --> 00:10:16.751
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>

373
00:10:16.751 --> 00:10:18.610
<v Speaker 2>you see that guy who's so on athletic,</v>

374
00:10:19.390 --> 00:10:22.270
<v Speaker 2>dangerous for your body because you could break shit like that.</v>

375
00:10:22.271 --> 00:10:24.160
<v Speaker 2>That's when you blow hamstrings.</v>

376
00:10:24.161 --> 00:10:25.120
<v Speaker 2>That's when you know you're,</v>

377
00:10:25.121 --> 00:10:25.331
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

378
00:10:25.331 --> 00:10:26.410
<v Speaker 2>you're designed wrong.</v>

379
00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:27.250
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

380
00:10:27.250 --> 00:10:28.870
<v Speaker 2>Putting all that power up in your upper body.</v>

381
00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:29.340
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

382
00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:30.880
<v Speaker 2>I don't look sexy girls,</v>

383
00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:31.743
<v Speaker 2>but you know what?</v>

384
00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:32.321
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

385
00:10:32.321 --> 00:10:32.560
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

386
00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:36.670
<v Speaker 4>the main thing if you're going to start with kettle bells too is if you seek out</v>

387
00:10:36.671 --> 00:10:37.570
<v Speaker 4>that local guy,</v>

388
00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:39.310
<v Speaker 4>you're going to learn technique.</v>

389
00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:41.290
<v Speaker 4>And even if you're already athletic,</v>

390
00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:42.680
<v Speaker 4>what was that?</v>

391
00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:42.990
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

392
00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:44.140
<v Speaker 2>Sounds like a door shut.</v>

393
00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:45.710
<v Speaker 2>Something happened here.</v>

394

00:11:24.271 --> 00:11:25.460
<v Speaker 4>if you were at the event,</v>

426
00:11:25.461 --> 00:11:26.600
<v Speaker 4>the back of the kettle bells,</v>

427
00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:27.240
<v Speaker 4>if you,</v>

00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:38.130
<v Speaker 4>It can really prevent an injury.</v>

435

493
00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:11.380
<v Speaker 5>I just did three weeks in a row.</v>

494
00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:12.431
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

495
00:13:12.431 --> 00:13:13.264
<v Speaker 5>I did,</v>

496
00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:14.140
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

497
00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:15.010
<v Speaker 5>Baltimore,</v>

498
00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:17.663
<v Speaker 5>Baltimore,</v>

499
00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:20.650
<v Speaker 5>then Cleveland and then Detroit back to back to back.</v>

500
00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:21.311
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

501
00:13:21.311 --> 00:13:21.611
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>

502
00:13:21.611 --> 00:13:25.600
<v Speaker 5>I'm doing like recovering cities of America places.</v>

503
00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:26.433
<v Speaker 5>I'm not going.</v>

504
00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:27.010
<v Speaker 5>Those are the three.</v>

505
00:13:27.010 --> 00:13:27.130
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

506
00:13:27.130 --> 00:13:27.311
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

507
00:13:27.311 --> 00:13:27.521
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

508
00:13:27.521 --> 00:13:31.810
<v Speaker 5>I did Ann Arbor and I felt like I was in a satellite colony outside of the death</v>

509
00:13:31.811 --> 00:13:32.560
<v Speaker 5>star.</v>

510
00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:33.400
<v Speaker 5>I felt like I was,</v>

511
00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:34.810
<v Speaker 5>I was hanging out on like,</v>

512
00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:38.350
<v Speaker 5>like some colony of white people try to keep it together.</v>

513
00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:38.771
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

514
00:13:38.771 --> 00:13:40.540
<v Speaker 5>there's state implodes around them.</v>

515
00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:45.840
<v Speaker 5>There is a 47% illiteracy rate in Chicago now or any serious Detroit right now.</v>

516
00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:52.120
<v Speaker 5>Detroit is the one that leaves the biggest impact for me.</v>

517
00:13:52.210 --> 00:13:52.900
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

518
00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:53.201
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

519
00:13:53.201 --> 00:13:54.130
<v Speaker 5>when you drive through it.</v>

520
00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:55.060
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

521
00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:56.860
<v Speaker 5>Baltimore's funny because Baltimore,</v>

522
00:13:57.760 --> 00:13:58.540
<v Speaker 5>they're like,</v>

523
00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:03.540
<v Speaker 5>it's all these rows where literally block to block the everything changes when</v>

524
00:14:04.991 --> 00:14:05.680
<v Speaker 5>you're in the city.</v>

525
00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:06.513
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

526
00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:07.090

529
00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:09.250
<v Speaker 5>This is a really good neighborhood.</v>

530
00:14:09.251 --> 00:14:12.550
<v Speaker 5>These are families now you see that next street right there.</v>

531
00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:14.110
<v Speaker 5>You don't want to fuck around on that street.</v>

532
00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:14.380
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

533
00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:15.400
<v Speaker 5>That one right there.</v>

534
00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:15.821
<v Speaker 5>And they're like,</v>

535
00:14:15.821 --> 00:14:16.031

00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:20.411
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

540
00:14:20.411 --> 00:14:22.150
<v Speaker 5>That's a whole different neighborhood right there.</v>

541
00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:23.560
<v Speaker 5>We saw that in DC.</v>

542
00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:24.521
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

543
00:14:24.521 --> 00:14:25.090
<v Speaker 5>We were talking,</v>

544
00:14:25.090 --> 00:14:28.810
<v Speaker 5>I went to DC with Ari and Ari grew up there.</v>

545
00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:28.981
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

546
00:14:28.981 --> 00:14:29.330
<v Speaker 5>that's right.</v>

547
00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:29.870
<v Speaker 5>He went the,</v>

548
00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:30.790
<v Speaker 5>it's where he first,</v>

549
00:14:30.791 --> 00:14:31.150
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

550
00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:31.960
<v Speaker 5>was uh,</v>

551
00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:33.730
<v Speaker 5>he was doing stand up at the Improv there too.</v>

552
00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:34.481
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

553
00:14:34.481 --> 00:14:37.210
<v Speaker 5>when we went down the street as we're driving,</v>

554
00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:39.370
<v Speaker 5>we're in this terrible neighborhood.</v>

555
00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:40.960
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's really bad.</v>

556
00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:42.670
<v Speaker 5>It's just like liquor stores,</v>

557
00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:45.220
<v Speaker 5>people hanging out half naked on a corner.</v>

558
00:14:45.410 --> 00:14:46.060
<v Speaker 5>It's just,</v>

559
00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:51.060
<v Speaker 5>it looked like it was real sketch and then two blocks over there's Volvos</v>

560
00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:57.040
<v Speaker 2>and shiny white people climbing out with your baby carriages.</v>

561
00:14:57.280 --> 00:14:57.821
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

562
00:14:57.821 --> 00:14:58.631
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

563
00:14:58.631 --> 00:15:00.220
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck is this?</v>

564
00:15:00.490 --> 00:15:01.450
<v Speaker 2>This is crazy.</v>

565
00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:02.440
<v Speaker 2>It was downtown La.</v>

566
00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:03.101
<v Speaker 2>Nah,</v>

567
00:15:03.101 --> 00:15:03.280
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

568
00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:05.020
<v Speaker 2>it was way more extreme.</v>

569
00:15:05.230 --> 00:15:07.180
<v Speaker 2>It's way more extreme on the east coast.</v>

570
00:15:07.181 --> 00:15:12.181
<v Speaker 2>The east coast has a completely different sense of like integration.</v>

571
00:15:12.970 --> 00:15:14.800
<v Speaker 2>There's integration in like New York City,</v>

572
00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:18.310
<v Speaker 2>but you just don't get in Los Angeles because nobody walks.</v>

573
00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:18.880
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

574
00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:19.151
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

575
00:15:19.151 --> 00:15:20.830
<v Speaker 2>So I think you live on top of each other.</v>

576
00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:25.270
<v Speaker 2>Living on top of each other is standard being on top of it or the being around</v>

577
00:15:25.390 --> 00:15:27.370
<v Speaker 2>people of all sorts of races,</v>

578
00:15:27.371 --> 00:15:28.181
<v Speaker 2>nationalities,</v>

579
00:15:28.181 --> 00:15:31.210
<v Speaker 2>origins of to be around them all the time like you are in New York.</v>

580
00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:36.480
<v Speaker 2>I think it leads people to be more open to the idea of being around people that</v>

581
00:15:37.391 --> 00:15:39.730
<v Speaker 2>aren't in their same economic group to being closer to them.</v>

582
00:15:39.770 --> 00:15:40.510
<v Speaker 2>Definitely.</v>

583
00:15:40.510 --> 00:15:41.800
<v Speaker 2>Whereas like in la,</v>

584
00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:42.641
<v Speaker 2>everybody's like,</v>

585
00:15:42.641 --> 00:15:44.440

00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:45.940
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to like,</v>

589
00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:49.270
<v Speaker 2>like have a nice place in the hood that is not even in the question.</v>

590
00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:49.591
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

593
00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:50.430
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

594
00:15:50.430 --> 00:15:55.380
<v Speaker 4>and Ellie's really sliced and diced where you know exactly where everything is.</v>

595
00:15:55.470 --> 00:15:57.390
<v Speaker 4>Like my dad's this neighborhood,</v>

596
00:15:57.391 --> 00:15:58.200
<v Speaker 4>this is this kind of,</v>

597
00:15:58.200 --> 00:15:59.033
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

598
00:15:59.390 --> 00:16:00.410
<v Speaker 2>it's very obvious.</v>

599
00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:01.700
<v Speaker 2>There's no integration.</v>

600
00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:04.010
<v Speaker 2>My friend Mo lives in Bedstuy in Brooklyn.</v>

601
00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:04.993
<v Speaker 2>He's a white guy.</v>

602
00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:05.480
<v Speaker 2>I really,</v>

603
00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:05.900
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

604
00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:06.141
<v Speaker 2>I could,</v>

605
00:16:06.141 --> 00:16:07.190
<v Speaker 2>why do you live in bed Stuy?</v>

606
00:16:07.270 --> 00:16:09.360
<v Speaker 2>That's where Mike Tyson grew up and talks about crazy.</v>

607
00:16:09.361 --> 00:16:09.770
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

608
00:16:09.770 --> 00:16:10.041
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>

609
00:16:10.041 --> 00:16:10.251
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

610
00:16:10.251 --> 00:16:10.461
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

611
00:16:10.461 --> 00:16:11.720
<v Speaker 2>they've cleaned it up quite a bit,</v>

612
00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:12.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

613
00:16:12.350 --> 00:16:12.861
<v Speaker 2>it goes a,</v>

614
00:16:12.861 --> 00:16:13.880
<v Speaker 2>nobody bothers us.</v>

615
00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:14.691
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

616
00:16:14.691 --> 00:16:15.141
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

617
00:16:15.141 --> 00:16:18.740
<v Speaker 2>I would rather live in a place like that and be able to afford an apartment.</v>

618
00:16:18.741 --> 00:16:20.870
<v Speaker 2>I can move around and then live in a box and,</v>

619
00:16:20.871 --> 00:16:21.091
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

620
00:16:21.091 --> 00:16:21.924
<v Speaker 2>and the city.</v>

621
00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:23.023
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

622
00:16:23.270 --> 00:16:24.230
<v Speaker 2>I guess it's like,</v>

623
00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:27.410
<v Speaker 2>that's one of the reasons why a lot of these neighborhoods have gotten better.</v>

624
00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:27.770
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

625
00:16:27.770 --> 00:16:29.270
<v Speaker 2>the idea of gentrification,</v>

626
00:16:29.570 --> 00:16:30.350
<v Speaker 2>the idea of like,</v>

627
00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:33.260
<v Speaker 2>and that's happened over and over again in New York when they realize,</v>

628
00:16:33.261 --> 00:16:33.920
<v Speaker 2>hey look,</v>

629
00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:35.330
<v Speaker 2>we've got a bad neighborhood,</v>

630
00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:38.750
<v Speaker 2>but it's just a neighborhood that's got a bunch of shitty places.</v>

631
00:16:38.751 --> 00:16:41.980
<v Speaker 2>If we buy those shitty places and start building nice places,</v>

632
00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:42.910
<v Speaker 2>then it's a good neighborhood.</v>

633
00:16:42.911 --> 00:16:43.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

634
00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:45.470
<v Speaker 2>And then it's worth a lot of fucking money and it can happen like that.</v>

635
00:16:45.770 --> 00:16:47.210
<v Speaker 4>It's happened on the east side of La.</v>

636
00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:47.400
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

637
00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:48.080
<v Speaker 4>A lot more.</v>

638
00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:49.370
<v Speaker 4>Los Filez silver lake.</v>

639
00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:49.560
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

640
00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:53.570
<v Speaker 4>The area that used to be an area that like white people didn't really just fuck</v>

641
00:16:53.571 --> 00:16:54.440
<v Speaker 4>around in at all.</v>

642
00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:55.030
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

643
00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:55.610
<v Speaker 4>it's uh,</v>

644
00:16:55.610 --> 00:16:57.890
<v Speaker 4>and then it's like a good artist area.</v>

645
00:16:58.290 --> 00:16:59.900
<v Speaker 4>But I'm saying like 20 years ago,</v>

646
00:16:59.901 --> 00:17:00.630
<v Speaker 4>like most,</v>

647
00:17:00.630 --> 00:17:01.220
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

648
00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:01.610
<v Speaker 4>it was,</v>

649
00:17:01.610 --> 00:17:02.330
<v Speaker 4>it was a lot of,</v>

650
00:17:02.330 --> 00:17:06.020
<v Speaker 4>it was much more Latin population and then now it's like,</v>

651
00:17:06.021 --> 00:17:06.170
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

652
00:17:06.170 --> 00:17:06.890
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

653
00:17:06.890 --> 00:17:11.890
<v Speaker 4>hipster community sliced and diced with a little bit of the Latinos that were</v>

654
00:17:12.321 --> 00:17:13.640
<v Speaker 4>there predominantly.</v>

655
00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:18.250
<v Speaker 4>So it's become like one bad motherfucker hipster move in and you know,</v>

656
00:17:18.290 --> 00:17:21.170
<v Speaker 4>I have to imagine it's the same scenario as your friend.</v>

657
00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:22.670
<v Speaker 4>I imagine it's the same scenario.</v>

658
00:17:22.671 --> 00:17:23.090
<v Speaker 4>I bet.</v>

659
00:17:23.090 --> 00:17:23.510
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

660
00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:26.480
<v Speaker 4>Whereas as one dude or a couple people were like,</v>

661
00:17:26.481 --> 00:17:28.700
<v Speaker 4>well we can get this bigger place and just kind of,</v>

662
00:17:28.990 --> 00:17:29.630
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

663
00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:34.630
<v Speaker 4>less desirable part of town for really cheap and then over time that slowly</v>

664
00:17:35.151 --> 00:17:36.290
<v Speaker 4>becomes a thing and then they've,</v>

665
00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:37.030
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

666
00:17:37.030 --> 00:17:38.810
<v Speaker 4>populated an area and it totally changed it.</v>

667
00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:39.261
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

668
00:17:39.261 --> 00:17:40.094
<v Speaker 4>It's kind of crazy.</v>

669
00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:40.860
<v Speaker 4>It's really,</v>

670
00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:41.571
<v Speaker 4>that'd be crazy.</v>

671
00:17:41.571 --> 00:17:42.740
<v Speaker 4>That happened in bedstuy though.</v>

672
00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:44.330
<v Speaker 4>Oh B</v>

673
00:17:44.650 --> 00:17:47.950
<v Speaker 2>it could easily happen because so many people spilling over from Manhattan.</v>

674
00:17:48.010 --> 00:17:48.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

675
00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:51.060
<v Speaker 2>There's so much money mean it's like a slow creep of money.</v>

676
00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:51.850
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

677
00:17:51.850 --> 00:17:53.370
<v Speaker 2>Those prices are insane.</v>

678
00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:53.611
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

679
00:17:53.611 --> 00:17:54.390
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing.</v>

00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:54.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

00:18:52.651 --> 00:18:53.484
<v Speaker 2>get me back.</v>

734
00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:54.331
<v Speaker 2>And he gets back.</v>

735
00:18:54.331 --> 00:18:54.571
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>

736
00:18:54.571 --> 00:18:55.500
<v Speaker 2>this is where I love it.</v>

737
00:18:55.501 --> 00:18:56.190
<v Speaker 2>I love it here.</v>

738
00:18:56.190 --> 00:18:57.990
<v Speaker 2>He loves the city being in there.</v>

739
00:18:58.210 --> 00:19:00.120
<v Speaker 2>I can see that you fall in love with that city though.</v>

740
00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:00.481
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

741
00:19:00.481 --> 00:19:01.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

742
00:19:01.170 --> 00:19:01.981
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people love it,</v>

743
00:19:01.981 --> 00:19:02.520
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

744
00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:03.480
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people love it.</v>

745
00:19:03.570 --> 00:19:04.440
<v Speaker 2>For a lot of people.</v>

746
00:19:04.441 --> 00:19:05.520
<v Speaker 2>It's like that,</v>

747
00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:07.740
<v Speaker 2>that idea of having everybody packed in together,</v>

748
00:19:07.741 --> 00:19:08.574
<v Speaker 2>they feel happy.</v>

749
00:19:08.610 --> 00:19:09.050
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

750
00:19:09.050 --> 00:19:09.390
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

751
00:19:09.390 --> 00:19:12.060
<v Speaker 4>there's really is something like always going on.</v>

752
00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:12.850
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

753
00:19:12.850 --> 00:19:13.420
<v Speaker 4>Oh yes.</v>

754
00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:15.540
<v Speaker 4>And I don't mean just like an activity,</v>

755
00:19:15.541 --> 00:19:18.900
<v Speaker 4>a party like just being on the standing on a corner.</v>

756
00:19:19.230 --> 00:19:20.640
<v Speaker 4>The street feels alive.</v>

757
00:19:20.710 --> 00:19:21.150
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

758
00:19:21.150 --> 00:19:22.080
<v Speaker 4>There's just always,</v>

759
00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:22.510
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

760
00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:23.343
<v Speaker 4>there's action.</v>

761
00:19:24.530 --> 00:19:28.400
<v Speaker 2>People are remarkably cool in New York when you consider how big that's it is.</v>

762
00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:28.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

763
00:19:28.970 --> 00:19:30.500
<v Speaker 2>I mean they're remarkably cool.</v>

764
00:19:30.590 --> 00:19:34.130
<v Speaker 2>Like people talk about how people are rude and the east coast like that.</v>

765
00:19:34.131 --> 00:19:34.964
<v Speaker 2>Not that rude.</v>

766
00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:36.160
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

767
00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:38.660
<v Speaker 2>I think New Yorkers are particularly friendly actually.</v>

768
00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:41.570
<v Speaker 2>I mean they're a little less tolerant of idiots,</v>

769
00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:46.130
<v Speaker 2>but I think that the intelligence level that the average intelligence level of</v>

770
00:19:46.131 --> 00:19:46.964
<v Speaker 2>people in the city,</v>

771
00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:48.410
<v Speaker 2>it's like a little higher.</v>

772
00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:50.990
<v Speaker 2>I tell him it's higher than Los Angeles.</v>

773
00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:51.940
<v Speaker 2>Like you,</v>

774
00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:52.380
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

775
00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:56.690
<v Speaker 2>the odds of you meeting a guy not knowing him very well and having a good</v>

776
00:19:56.691 --> 00:19:57.620
<v Speaker 2>conversation with them.</v>

777
00:19:57.680 --> 00:19:57.951
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

778
00:19:57.951 --> 00:20:01.970
<v Speaker 2>say if you're in a waiting room and he strike up a conversation and it being a</v>

779
00:20:01.971 --> 00:20:05.300
<v Speaker 2>really interesting conversation and the odds are way better in New York than</v>

780
00:20:05.301 --> 00:20:06.134
<v Speaker 2>they are in La.</v>

781
00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:07.493
<v Speaker 4>Great.</v>

782
00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:08.760
<v Speaker 4>Great observation.</v>

783
00:20:08.910 --> 00:20:10.290
<v Speaker 4>And 1000% agree.</v>

784
00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:12.870
<v Speaker 4>And not only that,</v>

785
00:20:12.871 --> 00:20:16.590
<v Speaker 4>I feel like La has a way higher sketch ball factor.</v>

786
00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:18.960
<v Speaker 4>Oh look at this fucking guy.</v>

787
00:20:20.290 --> 00:20:22.170
<v Speaker 4>Not like total hose artists.</v>

788
00:20:22.171 --> 00:20:22.600
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

789
00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:27.600
<v Speaker 4>You're going to roofie some chick just way high bullshit meters off the chain</v>

790
00:20:27.841 --> 00:20:28.230
<v Speaker 4>here.</v>

791
00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:29.340
<v Speaker 4>But you kind of go like,</v>

792
00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:30.050
<v Speaker 4>Nah.</v>

793
00:20:30.050 --> 00:20:30.883
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

794
00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:35.460
<v Speaker 4>And actually in New York you see some guy who might be like eccentric,</v>

795
00:20:35.461 --> 00:20:37.050
<v Speaker 4>kind of weird as shit looking,</v>

796
00:20:37.051 --> 00:20:40.950
<v Speaker 4>but then he's like a super intelligent guy that you can have a great</v>

797
00:20:40.951 --> 00:20:41.471
<v Speaker 4>conversation.</v>

798
00:20:41.471 --> 00:20:41.750
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

799
00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:42.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

800
00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:43.400
<v Speaker 2>It's super possible.</v>

801
00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:44.960
<v Speaker 2>And I mean not that you have,</v>

802
00:20:44.990 --> 00:20:47.260
<v Speaker 2>not that you would really use it if you were there,</v>

803
00:20:47.410 --> 00:20:50.770
<v Speaker 2>but you have access if you're in New York to the all those museums.</v>

804
00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:51.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

805
00:20:51.630 --> 00:20:52.660
<v Speaker 2>Just that alone,</v>

806
00:20:52.870 --> 00:20:55.090
<v Speaker 2>having all that stuff right there.</v>

807
00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:56.111
<v Speaker 2>I mean you're,</v>

808
00:20:56.111 --> 00:20:57.160
<v Speaker 2>you're dealing with,</v>

809
00:20:57.250 --> 00:20:58.930
<v Speaker 2>there's so many great museums.</v>

810
00:20:58.990 --> 00:20:59.291
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

811
00:20:59.291 --> 00:21:01.360
<v Speaker 2>There's so much cool shit to see.</v>

812
00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:03.520
<v Speaker 2>And there's a Neil Tyson's place.</v>

813
00:21:03.521 --> 00:21:03.851
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

814
00:21:03.851 --> 00:21:04.030
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

815
00:21:04.030 --> 00:21:04.241
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

816
00:21:04.241 --> 00:21:04.460
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

817
00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:06.550
<v Speaker 2>what does that a astronomy place Brian,</v>

818
00:21:06.551 --> 00:21:10.870
<v Speaker 2>but they have that huge place that he's the one at Griffith Park.</v>

819
00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:11.830
<v Speaker 2>Is that it is the Griffin?</v>

820
00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:12.071
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

821
00:21:12.071 --> 00:21:13.690
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't do the Griffith Park Observatory.</v>

822
00:21:13.691 --> 00:21:14.524
<v Speaker 2>That's out here.</v>

823
00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:15.453
<v Speaker 2>He does something.</v>

824
00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:18.600
<v Speaker 2>I was watching part of that podcast you did with this awesome.</v>

825
00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:19.120
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

826
00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:24.120
<v Speaker 2>it's really fun to watch as somebody who's just vocabulary is,</v>

827
00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:24.401
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

828
00:21:24.401 --> 00:21:25.420
<v Speaker 2>there's so our ticket,</v>

829
00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:26.263
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

830
00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:30.700
<v Speaker 2>It's actually fun to listen to them speak because they speak so richly.</v>

831
00:21:31.070 --> 00:21:31.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

832
00:21:31.330 --> 00:21:36.330
<v Speaker 2>So clearly I was like listening to him speak and then missing what he was</v>

833
00:21:36.911 --> 00:21:37.720
<v Speaker 2>saying.</v>

834
00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:38.261
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

835
00:21:38.261 --> 00:21:39.094
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

836
00:21:39.370 --> 00:21:41.230
<v Speaker 2>like he kinda hypnotizes you in a way.</v>

837
00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:42.520
<v Speaker 2>He has a beautiful voice.</v>

838
00:21:42.730 --> 00:21:43.563
<v Speaker 2>He's a beautiful man.</v>

839
00:21:44.270 --> 00:21:45.320
<v Speaker 2>He has a beautiful man,</v>

840
00:21:45.550 --> 00:21:46.990
<v Speaker 2>but he's his what's,</v>

841
00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:52.110
<v Speaker 2>there's something to be said about the tonal quality of someone's voice and</v>

842
00:21:52.390 --> 00:21:55.030
<v Speaker 2>their ability to understand what they sound like.</v>

843
00:21:55.090 --> 00:21:56.620
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of people don't know that.</v>

844
00:21:56.710 --> 00:22:00.430
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people who are super obnoxious and come off really fucking bad.</v>

845
00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:02.410
<v Speaker 2>One of the reasons why they come off bad,</v>

846
00:22:02.590 --> 00:22:06.640
<v Speaker 2>it's like they're not registering that their intent is not being accurately</v>

847
00:22:06.641 --> 00:22:08.400
<v Speaker 2>displayed by the way the communicate it.</v>

848
00:22:08.410 --> 00:22:08.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

849
00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:13.120
<v Speaker 2>There's like an the sounds that people don't like hearing this sharpness that's</v>

850
00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:13.890
<v Speaker 2>necessary.</v>

851
00:22:13.890 --> 00:22:15.730
<v Speaker 2>The misunderstandings a lot with what you're saying.</v>

852
00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:16.271
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

853
00:22:16.271 --> 00:22:17.010
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

854
00:22:17.010 --> 00:22:17.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

855
00:22:17.230 --> 00:22:17.441
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

856
00:22:17.441 --> 00:22:20.530
<v Speaker 2>what he does so well is he knows how,</v>

857
00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:20.981
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

858
00:22:20.981 --> 00:22:22.000
<v Speaker 2>he's got a beautiful voice.</v>

859
00:22:22.030 --> 00:22:23.820
<v Speaker 2>He knows how to use the voice,</v>

860
00:22:23.821 --> 00:22:26.290
<v Speaker 2>and he's got an immense vocabulary.</v>

861
00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:31.000
<v Speaker 2>He's got an immense amount of knowledge when it comes to the cosmos and you</v>

862
00:22:31.001 --> 00:22:31.241
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

863
00:22:31.241 --> 00:22:32.830
<v Speaker 2>and most of the stuff he's saying,</v>

864
00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:34.270
<v Speaker 2>you've never heard it before,</v>

865
00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:38.140
<v Speaker 2>but he knows it intimately and he's super passionate about it.</v>

866
00:22:38.170 --> 00:22:38.380
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

867
00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:40.750
<v Speaker 2>So it's like got a sense of theater to it,</v>

868
00:22:40.870 --> 00:22:43.690
<v Speaker 2>but it's also an insane information.</v>

869
00:22:43.691 --> 00:22:45.580
<v Speaker 2>Like he was telling us information about the,</v>

870
00:22:45.730 --> 00:22:48.310
<v Speaker 2>the actual possible size of the universe.</v>

871
00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:49.120
<v Speaker 2>And it just,</v>

872
00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:50.230
<v Speaker 2>it just makes you,</v>

873
00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:54.460
<v Speaker 2>it just makes you want to just not say anything for like 10 minutes and just go,</v>

874
00:22:54.461 --> 00:22:55.000
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

875
00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:55.833
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

876
00:22:56.230 --> 00:22:57.130
<v Speaker 2>Jesus.</v>

877
00:22:57.660 --> 00:22:58.240
<v Speaker 2>It's incredible.</v>

878
00:22:58.240 --> 00:22:58.511
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

879
00:22:58.511 --> 00:23:03.511
<v Speaker 2>Those guys are so important because science so often is dry to kids.</v>

880
00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:05.920
<v Speaker 2>Like a lot of kids think that science is like,</v>

881
00:23:06.250 --> 00:23:10.390
<v Speaker 2>you know the idea of studying stars like Eh,</v>

882
00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:11.230
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

883
00:23:11.230 --> 00:23:14.320
<v Speaker 2>it seems like doll and this is serious five,</v>

884
00:23:14.321 --> 00:23:14.681
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

885
00:23:14.681 --> 00:23:16.420
<v Speaker 2>this is a but but blah blah blah.</v>

886
00:23:16.450 --> 00:23:17.610
<v Speaker 2>The orbiter went around,</v>

887
00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:22.920
<v Speaker 2>they don't have this like engaging like contagious passion that he has and when</v>

888
00:23:23.291 --> 00:23:24.430
<v Speaker 2>kids hear him talk,</v>

889
00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:26.230
<v Speaker 2>they get super pumped up about it.</v>

890
00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:26.470
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

891
00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:30.400
<v Speaker 2>as they should imagine if he were your teacher and like school and like I</v>

892
00:23:30.401 --> 00:23:31.234
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't probably,</v>

893
00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:32.710
<v Speaker 2>I would have probably never been a comedian.</v>

894
00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:32.991
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

895
00:23:32.991 --> 00:23:33.520
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

896
00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:35.320
<v Speaker 2>I would've probably tried to be a scientist or something.</v>

897
00:23:35.321 --> 00:23:36.460
<v Speaker 2>I would have tried to be an astronomer.</v>

898
00:23:36.461 --> 00:23:36.760
<v Speaker 2>I forgot.</v>

899
00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:37.720
<v Speaker 2>Like that was my teacher.</v>

900
00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:38.920
<v Speaker 2>He would have been my hero.</v>

901
00:23:38.921 --> 00:23:39.491
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

902
00:23:39.491 --> 00:23:39.790
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

903
00:23:39.790 --> 00:23:40.623
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

904
00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:41.720
<v Speaker 2>to like the,</v>

905
00:23:41.721 --> 00:23:43.990
<v Speaker 2>the average fucking kid.</v>

906
00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:49.230
<v Speaker 2>It's like constantly searching for someone that represents who they'd like to be</v>

907
00:23:49.401 --> 00:23:50.450
<v Speaker 2>when they get older.</v>

908
00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:51.320
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

909
00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:52.430
<v Speaker 2>Because if you're around,</v>

910
00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:53.780
<v Speaker 2>even if you love your dad,</v>

911
00:23:54.050 --> 00:23:54.291
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

912
00:23:54.291 --> 00:23:56.000
<v Speaker 2>you're around your dad all the time.</v>

913
00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:58.220
<v Speaker 2>There's most likely a dad's and knucklehead,</v>

914
00:23:58.540 --> 00:23:58.761
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

915
00:23:58.761 --> 00:24:03.761
<v Speaker 2>your dad was born 1940 whatever it is for they're fucking idiots right from a</v>

916
00:24:04.341 --> 00:24:05.360
<v Speaker 2>different time.</v>

917
00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:08.330
<v Speaker 2>And so then you go to school and who you're dealing with,</v>

918
00:24:08.331 --> 00:24:08.700
<v Speaker 2>school,</v>

919
00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:09.150
<v Speaker 2>you punch.</v>

920
00:24:09.150 --> 00:24:10.520
<v Speaker 2>People don't really want that job.</v>

921
00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:11.990
<v Speaker 2>They just can't do anything else.</v>

922
00:24:11.991 --> 00:24:15.470
<v Speaker 2>And most of them are really miserable in their personal life.</v>

923
00:24:15.471 --> 00:24:18.110
<v Speaker 2>And if you knew them today as a grown adult,</v>

924
00:24:18.111 --> 00:24:19.280
<v Speaker 2>you would think there were fools.</v>

925
00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:19.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

926
00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:21.740
<v Speaker 2>But back then there the figures of authority.</v>

927
00:24:21.741 --> 00:24:25.220
<v Speaker 2>So it puts this sort of helpless feeling to you because you know their tools.</v>

928
00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:25.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

929
00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:26.930
<v Speaker 2>You know there are tools and you know,</v>

930
00:24:26.931 --> 00:24:28.250
<v Speaker 2>they're teaching you and you know,</v>

931
00:24:28.330 --> 00:24:29.390
<v Speaker 2>this is nonsense.</v>

932
00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:29.691
<v Speaker 2>They don't,</v>

933
00:24:29.691 --> 00:24:32.180
<v Speaker 2>they're not into this at all and they don't want to be here.</v>

934
00:24:32.330 --> 00:24:35.180
<v Speaker 2>And that's the majority of the teaching experiences that I had.</v>

935
00:24:35.210 --> 00:24:37.160
<v Speaker 2>The of being taught being class.</v>

936
00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:37.851
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

937
00:24:37.851 --> 00:24:38.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

938
00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:41.000
<v Speaker 2>It was a few standout guys who was a guy named Greg,</v>

939
00:24:41.001 --> 00:24:41.930
<v Speaker 2>who was a Spanish teacher,</v>

940
00:24:41.931 --> 00:24:42.764
<v Speaker 2>was really cool.</v>

941
00:24:42.770 --> 00:24:46.760
<v Speaker 2>But Greg wound up bang and the 17 year old hall law.</v>

942
00:24:47.030 --> 00:24:49.010
<v Speaker 5>Really if it was legal or not.</v>

943
00:24:49.130 --> 00:24:51.080
<v Speaker 5>I remember Mr Keener's breath</v>

944
00:24:52.730 --> 00:24:53.563
<v Speaker 5>fifth grade,</v>

945
00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:55.010
<v Speaker 5>if you had Neil Tyson.</v>

946
00:24:55.011 --> 00:24:55.130
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

947
00:24:55.130 --> 00:24:55.700
<v Speaker 2>For uh,</v>

948
00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:56.451
<v Speaker 2>a professor,</v>

949
00:24:56.451 --> 00:24:57.020
<v Speaker 2>you'd be,</v>

950
00:24:57.020 --> 00:24:58.160
<v Speaker 2>you'd be a fucking scientist.</v>

951
00:24:58.250 --> 00:24:59.083
<v Speaker 2>Totally.</v>

952
00:24:59.110 --> 00:25:01.520
<v Speaker 2>You were trying to do something in that world for sure.</v>

953
00:25:01.730 --> 00:25:02.570
<v Speaker 2>That world man,</v>

954
00:25:02.690 --> 00:25:06.530
<v Speaker 2>when those guys landed the rover on Mars and started screaming and cheering when</v>

955
00:25:06.531 --> 00:25:07.370
<v Speaker 2>the pictures started coming up,</v>

956
00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:08.520
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

957
00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:10.080
<v Speaker 5>You realize like how exciting.</v>

958
00:25:10.081 --> 00:25:11.020
<v Speaker 5>That must have been fun again,</v>

959
00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:12.450
<v Speaker 5>it's so,</v>

960
00:25:12.450 --> 00:25:16.860
<v Speaker 5>because the idea that they were embracing was so crazy that stream and you had</v>

961
00:25:16.861 --> 00:25:18.930
<v Speaker 5>so many detractors and you get people,</v>

962
00:25:18.931 --> 00:25:19.501
<v Speaker 5>you would say that too.</v>

963
00:25:19.501 --> 00:25:19.891
<v Speaker 5>And they were like,</v>

964
00:25:19.891 --> 00:25:21.090
<v Speaker 5>are you fucking stupid?</v>

965
00:25:21.630 --> 00:25:22.980
<v Speaker 5>Like smart people would say that to you.</v>

966
00:25:23.070 --> 00:25:25.260
<v Speaker 2>They're talking about sending people to Mars,</v>

967
00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:26.153
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

968
00:25:26.190 --> 00:25:27.180
<v Speaker 2>and they're talking about,</v>

969
00:25:27.181 --> 00:25:27.540
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

970
00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:28.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

971
00:25:28.230 --> 00:25:28.710
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

972
00:25:28.710 --> 00:25:31.620
<v Speaker 2>There's even a new thing about,</v>

973
00:25:31.621 --> 00:25:32.310
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

974
00:25:32.310 --> 00:25:36.330
<v Speaker 2>whether or not they should send couples because they probably won't ever be able</v>

975
00:25:36.331 --> 00:25:37.164
<v Speaker 2>to come back.</v>

976
00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:37.700
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

977
00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:38.533
<v Speaker 5>dude.</v>

978
00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:39.710
<v Speaker 5>Now imagine that.</v>

979
00:25:39.711 --> 00:25:42.410
<v Speaker 5>Imagine for a second if they pulled that off,</v>

980
00:25:42.650 --> 00:25:44.600
<v Speaker 5>what our reaction would be watching that.</v>

981
00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:45.031
<v Speaker 5>Like if,</v>

982
00:25:45.031 --> 00:25:45.220
<v Speaker 5>if,</v>

983
00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:46.640
<v Speaker 5>if they landed and they were like,</v>

984
00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:46.910
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

985
00:25:46.910 --> 00:25:47.571
<v Speaker 5>we're on Mars,</v>

986
00:25:47.571 --> 00:25:48.560
<v Speaker 5>it's fucking awesome here.</v>

987
00:25:48.561 --> 00:25:48.921
<v Speaker 5>You guys,</v>

988
00:25:48.921 --> 00:25:49.400
<v Speaker 5>we would be like,</v>

989
00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:50.233
<v Speaker 5>oh my God,</v>

990
00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:51.190
<v Speaker 5>what did he say</v>

991
00:25:51.190 --> 00:25:52.023
<v Speaker 1>back to</v>

992
00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:54.590
<v Speaker 1>rescue us?</v>

993
00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:55.700
<v Speaker 1>It takes six</v>

994
00:25:55.700 --> 00:25:56.720
<v Speaker 5>some months to get there.</v>

995
00:25:56.750 --> 00:25:57.680
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>

996
00:25:57.710 --> 00:25:58.820
<v Speaker 5>What if they didn't know?</v>

997
00:25:59.030 --> 00:26:00.500
<v Speaker 5>But that there's a constant</v>

998
00:26:00.990 --> 00:26:01.823
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>

999
00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:04.640
<v Speaker 5>Back Mars.</v>

1000
00:26:04.970 --> 00:26:09.020
<v Speaker 5>Nobody recorded any sound and I don't realize it until they open the hatch.</v>

1001
00:26:09.490 --> 00:26:13.020
<v Speaker 1>This the planet makes us sound shit.</v>

1002
00:26:13.050 --> 00:26:13.960
<v Speaker 1>Oh Shit.</v>

1003
00:26:15.180 --> 00:26:15.721
<v Speaker 5>Pick you up.</v>

1004
00:26:15.721 --> 00:26:16.620
<v Speaker 5>It's going to be awhile.</v>

1005
00:26:16.890 --> 00:26:18.090
<v Speaker 5>And we're just smell like pussy,</v>

1006
00:26:19.290 --> 00:26:20.123
<v Speaker 5>pussy,</v>

1007
00:26:22.350 --> 00:26:22.970
<v Speaker 5>rats.</v>

1008
00:26:22.970 --> 00:26:23.171
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

1009
00:26:23.171 --> 00:26:24.620
<v Speaker 2>they can't pick you up at all.</v>

1010
00:26:24.621 --> 00:26:25.640
<v Speaker 2>They can't get you.</v>

1011
00:26:26.150 --> 00:26:29.510
<v Speaker 2>They can send more people to hug you and give you your plugs.</v>

1012
00:26:29.790 --> 00:26:30.470
<v Speaker 2>She can't,</v>

1013
00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:31.250
<v Speaker 2>they can't send,</v>

1014
00:26:31.250 --> 00:26:33.110
<v Speaker 2>they can't send you back there.</v>

1015
00:26:33.150 --> 00:26:37.040
<v Speaker 2>The first trips they believe with people are going to be one way trips.</v>

1016
00:26:37.550 --> 00:26:38.030
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

1017
00:26:38.030 --> 00:26:38.863
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1018
00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:40.460
<v Speaker 5>But how would you drop them?</v>

1019
00:26:40.490 --> 00:26:41.480
<v Speaker 5>What would you leave them with?</v>

1020
00:26:41.510 --> 00:26:43.010
<v Speaker 5>W with enough to live with what?</v>

1021
00:26:43.050 --> 00:26:43.610
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1022
00:26:43.610 --> 00:26:43.980
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1023
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:44.731
<v Speaker 5>you got to get one of them,</v>

1024
00:26:44.731 --> 00:26:45.564
<v Speaker 5>boy scout knives.</v>

1025
00:26:45.570 --> 00:26:46.930
<v Speaker 5>They'd have like a bunch of different things.</v>

1026
00:26:46.931 --> 00:26:50.170
<v Speaker 5>So it's a spoon and a magnifying glass.</v>

1027
00:26:50.171 --> 00:26:52.080
<v Speaker 5>And you guys can make it three weeks and they're like,</v>

1028
00:26:52.081 --> 00:26:52.590
<v Speaker 5>what,</v>

1029
00:26:52.590 --> 00:26:53.250
<v Speaker 5>three weeks?</v>

1030
00:26:53.250 --> 00:26:54.120
<v Speaker 5>Oh Man.</v>

1031
00:26:54.150 --> 00:26:55.080
<v Speaker 5>Fuck that.</v>

1032
00:26:55.081 --> 00:26:56.010
<v Speaker 5>No it's not.</v>

1033
00:26:56.011 --> 00:26:57.180
<v Speaker 5>It can't be cool enough.</v>

1034
00:26:57.210 --> 00:26:57.751
<v Speaker 5>There's no way.</v>

1035
00:26:57.751 --> 00:27:00.330
<v Speaker 5>I mean the idea of being the first person on Mars,</v>

1036
00:27:00.331 --> 00:27:03.180
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure it's going to be appealing to a lot of people,</v>

1037
00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:04.231
<v Speaker 5>but not to me,</v>

1038
00:27:04.231 --> 00:27:04.590
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

1039
00:27:04.590 --> 00:27:04.921
<v Speaker 5>To me,</v>

1040
00:27:04.921 --> 00:27:05.400
<v Speaker 5>I'd be like,</v>

1041
00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:05.791
<v Speaker 5>listen,</v>

1042
00:27:05.791 --> 00:27:07.590
<v Speaker 5>I'm not living in some fucking movie.</v>

1043
00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:08.370
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

1044
00:27:08.370 --> 00:27:08.640
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

1045
00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:09.061
<v Speaker 5>you're not,</v>

1046
00:27:09.061 --> 00:27:10.970
<v Speaker 5>I'm not going to be the first guy on Mars pitch.</v>

1047
00:27:10.971 --> 00:27:12.540
<v Speaker 5>Are you phrasing?</v>

1048
00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:15.090
<v Speaker 5>Do you know how bad Mars could suck?</v>

1049
00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:16.333
<v Speaker 5>Do you know back inside?</v>

1050
00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:17.550
<v Speaker 5>Do you want to live in Antarctica?</v>

1051
00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:18.800
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to live in New York,</v>

1052
00:27:19.050 --> 00:27:20.190
<v Speaker 5>but living in Antarctica,</v>

1053
00:27:20.250 --> 00:27:20.970
<v Speaker 5>I mean you,</v>

1054
00:27:20.970 --> 00:27:23.820
<v Speaker 5>you might as well be living at arc if you leave it on fucking Mars,</v>

1055
00:27:23.860 --> 00:27:24.450
<v Speaker 5>might as well.</v>

1056
00:27:24.450 --> 00:27:24.691
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1057
00:27:24.691 --> 00:27:25.380
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>

1058
00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:27.510
<v Speaker 5>that's not desirable least man.</v>

1059
00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:29.310
<v Speaker 5>Cause I'm pretty sure you're going to have to,</v>

1060
00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:29.941
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1061
00:27:29.941 --> 00:27:31.530
<v Speaker 5>you're going to have to wear a mask everywhere you go.</v>

1062
00:27:31.531 --> 00:27:35.100
<v Speaker 5>You're going to home or they're going to have to put a dome over that bitch of</v>

1063
00:27:35.101 --> 00:27:35.491
<v Speaker 5>course.</v>

1064
00:27:35.491 --> 00:27:36.360
<v Speaker 5>And do you realize,</v>

1065
00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:41.420
<v Speaker 5>I'm like how unpredictable the entire thing from they get like shit.</v>

1066
00:27:43.321 --> 00:27:43.591
<v Speaker 5>They're like,</v>

1067
00:27:43.591 --> 00:27:44.850
<v Speaker 5>we thought it was going to be like this.</v>

1068
00:27:44.851 --> 00:27:45.211
<v Speaker 5>They're gonna be like,</v>

1069
00:27:45.211 --> 00:27:45.391
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1070
00:27:45.391 --> 00:27:50.130
<v Speaker 5>that's not really saying rocks and they hurt like everything that you thought it</v>

1071
00:27:50.131 --> 00:27:51.000
<v Speaker 5>could be way,</v>

1072
00:27:51.001 --> 00:27:51.481
<v Speaker 5>way off,</v>

1073
00:27:51.481 --> 00:27:51.710
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

1074
00:27:51.710 --> 00:27:52.191
<v Speaker 5>Not only that,</v>

1075
00:27:52.191 --> 00:27:52.470
<v Speaker 5>right</v>

1076
00:27:52.470 --> 00:27:54.630
<v Speaker 2>bet Mars gets more fucking asteroids.</v>

1077
00:27:55.290 --> 00:27:58.410
<v Speaker 2>I bet they get more impacts because Mars is,</v>

1078
00:28:00.290 --> 00:28:00.630
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1079
00:28:00.630 --> 00:28:01.710
<v Speaker 2>I hope I'm not wrong about this,</v>

1080
00:28:01.711 --> 00:28:03.270
<v Speaker 2>but as it's been explained to me,</v>

1081
00:28:03.271 --> 00:28:06.810
<v Speaker 2>there's something called boats law and bodes law represents,</v>

1082
00:28:07.250 --> 00:28:11.580
<v Speaker 2>it's a way of measuring by gravity and mass.</v>

1083
00:28:11.910 --> 00:28:13.800
<v Speaker 2>When you get a series of planets,</v>

1084
00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:16.380
<v Speaker 2>when you measure the mass of one,</v>

1085
00:28:16.381 --> 00:28:20.700
<v Speaker 2>you can accurately predict how far away the next plan should be and apparently</v>

1086
00:28:20.730 --> 00:28:25.730
<v Speaker 2>the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter is the only thing wrong with boats</v>

1087
00:28:26.041 --> 00:28:27.420
<v Speaker 2>law in this source system.</v>

1088
00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:27.991
<v Speaker 2>As explained,</v>

1089
00:28:27.991 --> 00:28:28.471
<v Speaker 2>explained to me,</v>

1090
00:28:28.471 --> 00:28:29.304
<v Speaker 2>I might be wrong,</v>

1091
00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:34.940
<v Speaker 2>but that there's so many asteroids close to Mars and Jupiter that most likely</v>

1092
00:28:35.221 --> 00:28:39.570
<v Speaker 2>the idea is that either that's leftover shit from the formation of galaxies or</v>

1093
00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:44.750
<v Speaker 2>it could be leftover from an impact like earth one and earth to Earth at one</v>

1094
00:28:45.121 --> 00:28:47.490
<v Speaker 2>point in time was hit by another planet.</v>

1095
00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:48.661
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>

1096
00:28:48.661 --> 00:28:48.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1097
00:28:48.930 --> 00:28:51.120
<v Speaker 2>That's like the main stream,</v>

1098
00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:51.530
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1099
00:28:51.530 --> 00:28:53.850
<v Speaker 2>acceptance of how the moon was created.</v>

1100
00:28:54.090 --> 00:28:54.780
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

1101
00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:55.120
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1102
00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:55.420
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1103
00:28:55.420 --> 00:28:55.861
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1104
00:28:55.861 --> 00:28:56.041
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1105
00:28:56.041 --> 00:28:57.660
<v Speaker 2>just the evolution of the earth itself.</v>

1106
00:28:57.690 --> 00:28:59.850
<v Speaker 2>And so it was at one point in time,</v>

1107
00:28:59.851 --> 00:29:01.410
<v Speaker 2>we were actually hit by a planet.</v>

1108
00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:06.180
<v Speaker 2>Imagine how dude hit by a planet.</v>

1109
00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:08.010
<v Speaker 2>We got hit by a planet.</v>

1110
00:29:08.130 --> 00:29:12.030
<v Speaker 2>So we basically became an enormous ball of lava.</v>

1111
00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:12.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1112
00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:12.661
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>

1113
00:29:12.661 --> 00:29:15.390
<v Speaker 2>who knows how long before everything cooled off.</v>

1114
00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:15.710
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1115
00:29:15.710 --> 00:29:16.170
<v Speaker 2>do you know,</v>

1116
00:29:16.170 --> 00:29:21.170
<v Speaker 2>who knows how many thousands of fucking years everything burned have to get hit</v>

1117
00:29:21.181 --> 00:29:21.691
<v Speaker 2>by a planet?</v>

1118
00:29:21.691 --> 00:29:25.350
<v Speaker 2>Plus a giant chunk of us came flying off and became the moon.</v>

1119
00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:26.521
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1120
00:29:26.521 --> 00:29:28.680
<v Speaker 2>That's the whole idea of it all.</v>

1121
00:29:28.681 --> 00:29:30.040
<v Speaker 2>It seems it's,</v>

1122
00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:31.210
<v Speaker 2>it's two fantastic.</v>

1123
00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:33.241
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1124
00:29:33.241 --> 00:29:33.511
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1125
00:29:33.511 --> 00:29:35.040
<v Speaker 2>it's just as fantastic.</v>

1126
00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:35.791
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

1127
00:29:35.791 --> 00:29:38.280
<v Speaker 2>A planet floating above us every day.</v>

1128
00:29:38.550 --> 00:29:41.770
<v Speaker 2>Every day we go outside in broad daylight.</v>

1129
00:29:41.771 --> 00:29:44.170
<v Speaker 2>You can see the Moon in California because you know,</v>

1130
00:29:44.171 --> 00:29:47.650
<v Speaker 2>I know you poor folks in Columbus get cloudy skies all throughout the winter.</v>

1131
00:29:48.050 --> 00:29:48.710
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1132
00:29:48.710 --> 00:29:50.800
<v Speaker 2>Cincinnati was the same way this weekend,</v>

1133
00:29:50.801 --> 00:29:52.300
<v Speaker 2>but you come back to La,</v>

1134
00:29:52.301 --> 00:29:53.560
<v Speaker 2>you can see the moon in the middle of day.</v>

1135
00:29:53.650 --> 00:29:56.560
<v Speaker 2>You'll see it fat and juicy just sitting up in the sky.</v>

1136
00:29:56.960 --> 00:29:59.350
<v Speaker 2>It looks all beautiful and the blue sky,</v>

1137
00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:03.520
<v Speaker 2>it's a floating planet and you're looking at it with your eyes and it's a</v>

1138
00:30:03.521 --> 00:30:05.680
<v Speaker 2>quarter of the size of the earth and it's right there.</v>

1139
00:30:05.770 --> 00:30:06.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1140
00:30:06.110 --> 00:30:08.860
<v Speaker 2>it's floating in the air above you.</v>

1141
00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:13.420
<v Speaker 2>Like that might be the nuttiest shit you ever get to look at and you're just</v>

1142
00:30:13.421 --> 00:30:13.660
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1143
00:30:13.660 --> 00:30:13.871
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

1144
00:30:13.871 --> 00:30:14.501
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

1145
00:30:14.501 --> 00:30:15.670
<v Speaker 2>I'm waiting for Ufo.</v>

1146
00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:20.880
<v Speaker 2>The UFO ain't nearly as crazy as the fact that there's a fucking planet floating</v>

1147
00:30:21.401 --> 00:30:22.480
<v Speaker 2>in the air.</v>

1148
00:30:22.510 --> 00:30:22.791
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1149
00:30:22.791 --> 00:30:23.920
<v Speaker 2>you can see it.</v>

1150
00:30:23.980 --> 00:30:25.720
<v Speaker 2>You just got to make sense for real.</v>

1151
00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:27.041
<v Speaker 2>Like a teacher.</v>

1152
00:30:27.041 --> 00:30:27.874
<v Speaker 2>You're like that guy.</v>

1153
00:30:28.030 --> 00:30:29.290
<v Speaker 2>The moon is enormous,</v>

1154
00:30:29.291 --> 00:30:29.710
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1155
00:30:29.710 --> 00:30:31.450
<v Speaker 2>The moon is really big for food.</v>

1156
00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:32.960
<v Speaker 2>We take it for granted how cool it is.</v>

1157
00:30:33.260 --> 00:30:33.820
<v Speaker 2>See it.</v>

1158
00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:34.180
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1159
00:30:34.180 --> 00:30:36.160
<v Speaker 2>you see the same side to,</v>

1160
00:30:36.161 --> 00:30:37.420
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't even spin.</v>

1161
00:30:37.660 --> 00:30:39.130
<v Speaker 2>It rotates around us.</v>

1162
00:30:39.250 --> 00:30:40.330
<v Speaker 2>The moon is a trip,</v>

1163
00:30:40.331 --> 00:30:40.631
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1164
00:30:40.631 --> 00:30:43.540
<v Speaker 2>The moon's that trip and so many ways because they say that if a moon wasn't as</v>

1165
00:30:43.541 --> 00:30:44.650
<v Speaker 2>big as it is,</v>

1166
00:30:44.860 --> 00:30:46.590
<v Speaker 2>our gravity or our,</v>

1167
00:30:46.591 --> 00:30:47.170
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1168
00:30:47.170 --> 00:30:48.760
<v Speaker 2>atmosphere wouldn't be a stable,</v>

1169
00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:49.661
<v Speaker 2>like our,</v>

1170
00:30:49.661 --> 00:30:50.500
<v Speaker 2>we wouldn't,</v>

1171
00:30:50.690 --> 00:30:51.020
<v Speaker 2>our,</v>

1172
00:30:51.020 --> 00:30:51.371
<v Speaker 2>our,</v>

1173
00:30:51.371 --> 00:30:51.910
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1174
00:30:51.910 --> 00:30:53.290
<v Speaker 2>orbit wouldn't be a stable.</v>

1175
00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:57.550
<v Speaker 2>And what stabilizes us is we have this massive objects sitting there with us.</v>

1176
00:30:57.600 --> 00:30:58.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1177
00:30:58.420 --> 00:30:59.110
<v Speaker 2>that's crazy.</v>

1178
00:30:59.110 --> 00:30:59.943
<v Speaker 2>That's nuts.</v>

1179
00:30:59.980 --> 00:31:03.480
<v Speaker 2>Like an ordered liberty literally to have this kind of life that,</v>

1180
00:31:03.490 --> 00:31:04.001
<v Speaker 2>and people are like,</v>

1181
00:31:04.001 --> 00:31:04.710
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

1182
00:31:04.710 --> 00:31:05.141

1183
00:31:05.141 --> 00:31:06.040
<v Speaker 2>it'd be no life.</v>

1184
00:31:06.550 --> 00:31:06.850
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1185
00:31:06.850 --> 00:31:08.110
<v Speaker 2>it just wouldn't be this kind of life.</v>

1186
00:31:08.530 --> 00:31:11.410
<v Speaker 2>Life with figures shit out for sure.</v>

1187
00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:12.430
<v Speaker 2>Life figure shit out.</v>

1188
00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:13.353
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

1189
00:31:13.930 --> 00:31:16.480
<v Speaker 2>I'm just amazed that no one's ever figured shit out in the ocean.</v>

1190
00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:17.860
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>

1191
00:31:17.860 --> 00:31:18.790
<v Speaker 2>there's so much of it,</v>

1192
00:31:18.791 --> 00:31:19.030
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1193
00:31:19.030 --> 00:31:19.870
<v Speaker 2>It's a big,</v>

1194
00:31:19.990 --> 00:31:22.060
<v Speaker 2>but like life never figured shit out in the ocean.</v>

1195
00:31:22.230 --> 00:31:22.990
<v Speaker 2>Oh right.</v>

1196
00:31:22.990 --> 00:31:25.030
<v Speaker 2>Life in the ocean still lives like a fish.</v>

1197
00:31:25.450 --> 00:31:26.110
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

1198
00:31:26.110 --> 00:31:29.560
<v Speaker 2>Could you imagine if like we're running around on earth claiming to be super</v>

1199
00:31:29.561 --> 00:31:29.891
<v Speaker 2>smart,</v>

1200
00:31:29.891 --> 00:31:31.840
<v Speaker 2>but we're still running around killing things with her face.</v>

1201
00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:33.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1202
00:31:33.340 --> 00:31:34.120
<v Speaker 2>We would say like,</v>

1205
00:31:37.630 --> 00:31:37.811
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1206
00:31:37.811 --> 00:31:38.111
<v Speaker 2>we are.</v>

1207
00:31:38.111 --> 00:31:38.980
<v Speaker 2>Because we have a language.</v>

1208
00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:40.510
<v Speaker 2>Those poor dolphins,</v>

1209
00:31:40.540 --> 00:31:42.190
<v Speaker 2>those poor fucks and killer whales,</v>

1210
00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:43.900
<v Speaker 2>they live in like regular fish.</v>

1211
00:31:44.980 --> 00:31:46.180
<v Speaker 2>They don't have condos.</v>

1212
00:31:46.210 --> 00:31:47.820
<v Speaker 2>It's true of the car.</v>

1213
00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:50.350
<v Speaker 2>They didn't have TVs and everybody's like,</v>

1214
00:31:50.380 --> 00:31:50.681
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1215
00:31:50.681 --> 00:31:51.910
<v Speaker 2>they're just as smartest people.</v>

1216
00:31:51.970 --> 00:31:53.740
<v Speaker 2>The fuck they are the fuck they are.</v>

1217
00:31:53.770 --> 00:31:54.520
<v Speaker 2>Stop it.</v>

1218
00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:55.660
<v Speaker 2>They're not creating anything.</v>

1219
00:31:55.790 --> 00:31:56.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1220
00:31:56.170 --> 00:31:59.200
<v Speaker 2>They could just make noise with their face and catch fish.</v>

1221
00:31:59.270 --> 00:32:00.130
<v Speaker 2>Just bigger fish.</v>

1222
00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:00.311
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1223
00:32:00.311 --> 00:32:01.210
<v Speaker 2>they did pig there.</v>

1224
00:32:01.211 --> 00:32:02.080
<v Speaker 2>You know they're animals.</v>

1225
00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:05.530
<v Speaker 2>They've taken the air through a poll,</v>

1226
00:32:06.010 --> 00:32:07.900
<v Speaker 2>but basically they live like a fish.</v>

1227
00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:10.390
<v Speaker 2>There's not much difference between the killer whale on the tuna,</v>

1228
00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:11.300
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1229
00:32:11.300 --> 00:32:14.260
<v Speaker 2>As far as like how the forced to live,</v>

1230
00:32:14.610 --> 00:32:16.930
<v Speaker 2>you've got to go get yours is no supermarket,</v>

1231
00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:18.190
<v Speaker 2>no credit cards.</v>

1232
00:32:18.610 --> 00:32:19.870
<v Speaker 2>They live like savages.</v>

1233
00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:20.410
<v Speaker 2>They live.</v>

1234
00:32:20.410 --> 00:32:20.601
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1235
00:32:20.601 --> 00:32:21.434
<v Speaker 2>they are.</v>

1236
00:32:21.730 --> 00:32:23.650
<v Speaker 2>They're just like the bottom feeding fish.</v>

1237
00:32:23.651 --> 00:32:24.010
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

1238
00:32:24.010 --> 00:32:24.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1239
00:32:24.350 --> 00:32:25.061
<v Speaker 2>They're ridiculous.</v>

1240
00:32:25.061 --> 00:32:29.410
<v Speaker 2>They're scrubs man scrubs the of the universe and killer killer whale scrubs.</v>

1241
00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:33.430
<v Speaker 2>Imagine if there really was intelligent life in something figured out.</v>

1242
00:32:33.490 --> 00:32:34.510
<v Speaker 2>I mean it doesn't seem,</v>

1243
00:32:34.790 --> 00:32:39.470
<v Speaker 2>it seems to me that if a monkey can figure out how to be conscious and how to be</v>

1244
00:32:39.471 --> 00:32:40.400
<v Speaker 2>a intelligent</v>

1245
00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:41.233
<v Speaker 5>here,</v>

1246
00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:45.860
<v Speaker 5>that a fish could figure out how to be conscious and intelligent down there and</v>

1247
00:32:45.861 --> 00:32:50.840
<v Speaker 5>develop a way to get up to the air world and wear like a a big water mask and</v>

1248
00:32:50.870 --> 00:32:51.650
<v Speaker 5>come and visit us.</v>

1249
00:32:51.650 --> 00:32:52.490
<v Speaker 5>They totally should,</v>

1250
00:32:52.491 --> 00:32:56.510
<v Speaker 5>but I think it doesn't happen because of there'll be just too much conflict.</v>

1251
00:32:56.511 --> 00:32:57.440
<v Speaker 5>When we started talking,</v>

1252
00:32:57.500 --> 00:32:59.420
<v Speaker 5>well he tried to open land parks.</v>

00:33:20.961 --> 00:33:24.880
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to guess I'm going to go with 1961 but um,</v>

<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

1343
00:35:50.950 --> 00:35:51.760
<v Speaker 8>Shocking,</v>

1344
00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:54.040
<v Speaker 8>shocking in the stark realism.</v>

1345

<v Speaker 8>Look how weak that dude looks.</v>

1350

<v Speaker 8>Those dudes didn't know deadlifts.</v>

1355
00:36:18.130 --> 00:36:19.000
<v Speaker 8>Absolutely.</v>

00:36:32.321 --> 00:36:33.071
<v Speaker 8>It never worked out.</v>

1367
00:36:33.071 --> 00:36:35.950
<v Speaker 8>A day in her life with a billion eggs inside of her.</v>

<v Speaker 8>Three dimension creature from the black lagoon.</v>

1401
00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:36.140
<v Speaker 8>Isn't in the fascinating thing when you can go back and back in</v>

1402
00:37:36.140 --> 00:37:39.450
<v Speaker 5>time like that and see something and see what,</v>

1403
00:37:39.570 --> 00:37:42.770
<v Speaker 5>what media looked like in 1954 oh my God.</v>

1404
00:37:42.890 --> 00:37:43.723
<v Speaker 5>I know.</v>

1405
00:37:43.790 --> 00:37:46.490
<v Speaker 5>And then that you know that people would see certain things.</v>

1406
00:37:46.491 --> 00:37:47.630
<v Speaker 5>It'd be so captivated.</v>

1407
00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:48.080
<v Speaker 5>Valid.</v>

1408
00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:52.090
<v Speaker 5>We would fucking love that movie if we lived in 1954 yeah.</v>

1409
00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:53.930
<v Speaker 5>Well actually what do we as adults,</v>

1410
00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:55.130
<v Speaker 5>what would it be so psyched?</v>

1411
00:37:55.190 --> 00:37:55.730
<v Speaker 5>I think so.</v>

1412
00:37:55.730 --> 00:37:57.500
<v Speaker 5>Because you had never seen shit like that.</v>

1413
00:37:58.250 --> 00:37:59.420
<v Speaker 5>You might even be more impressed.</v>

1414
00:37:59.421 --> 00:37:59.601
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

1415
00:37:59.601 --> 00:38:00.530
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck?</v>

1416
00:38:00.531 --> 00:38:01.490
<v Speaker 5>How did they do this?</v>

1417
00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:02.241
<v Speaker 5>But I was thinking like,</v>

1418
00:38:02.241 --> 00:38:03.130
<v Speaker 5>who goes to sales movie?</v>

1419
00:38:03.150 --> 00:38:03.983
<v Speaker 5>Would it be kids?</v>

1420
00:38:04.100 --> 00:38:05.270
<v Speaker 5>Because in 1954,</v>

1421
00:38:05.271 --> 00:38:06.680
<v Speaker 5>guys our age are almost dead.</v>

1422
00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:08.353
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1423
00:38:08.390 --> 00:38:08.901
<v Speaker 5>that's true.</v>

1424
00:38:08.901 --> 00:38:09.920
<v Speaker 5>I had a late thirties.</v>

1425
00:38:09.921 --> 00:38:10.071
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

1426
00:38:10.071 --> 00:38:10.580
<v Speaker 5>who are you?</v>

1427
00:38:10.580 --> 00:38:11.510
<v Speaker 5>You're not even alive.</v>

1428
00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:12.373
<v Speaker 5>But they're also,</v>

1429
00:38:12.650 --> 00:38:15.440
<v Speaker 5>they're also more like scared of,</v>

1430
00:38:15.441 --> 00:38:16.274
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1431
00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:18.350
<v Speaker 5>the unknown of the unknown.</v>

1432
00:38:19.070 --> 00:38:21.560
<v Speaker 5>But I think that would be a thing where they'd be like,</v>

1433
00:38:21.590 --> 00:38:21.801
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 5>This is an adults only kind of rated r mean Appdex.</v>

1437
00:38:27.351 --> 00:38:30.350
<v Speaker 5>This white woman takes her to the bottom of the ocean.</v>

1438
00:38:30.390 --> 00:38:31.220
<v Speaker 5>He's scary,</v>

1439
00:38:31.220 --> 00:38:31.761
<v Speaker 5>real scary.</v>

1440
00:38:31.761 --> 00:38:32.300
<v Speaker 5>And he's,</v>

1441
00:38:32.300 --> 00:38:35.710
<v Speaker 5>you don't take a white bitch into the bottom of the ocean unless you in either</v>

00:38:38.060 --> 00:38:40.360
<v Speaker 5>You're probably going to kill her unless you can come really quick.</v>

1446
00:38:40.550 --> 00:38:41.410
<v Speaker 5>She's going to drown.</v>

1447
00:38:41.980 --> 00:38:43.000
<v Speaker 5>It's rude.</v>

1448
00:38:43.090 --> 00:38:43.570
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1450
00:38:44.650 --> 00:38:46.150

00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:48.010
<v Speaker 5>1954.</v>

1452
00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:49.900
<v Speaker 5>The audience wasn't ready.</v>

1453
00:38:50.030 --> 00:38:53.630
<v Speaker 5>Do you know the creature was modeled after the Oscar real?</v>

1454
00:38:53.631 --> 00:38:54.464
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1455
00:38:55.220 --> 00:38:55.630
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1456
00:38:55.630 --> 00:38:55.781
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1457
00:38:55.781 --> 00:38:58.600
<v Speaker 5>they figured with a fucking plot like this were a shoe it,</v>

00:38:59.830 --> 00:39:01.330
<v Speaker 5>how could we go wrong?</v>

1459
00:39:01.780 --> 00:39:03.890
<v Speaker 5>Guys were dealing with a Gil man.</v>

1460
00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:08.710
<v Speaker 5>He's a monster that kidnaps and then fucks and we got hot white benches that he</v>

1461
00:39:08.711 --> 00:39:09.461
<v Speaker 5>kidnaps.</v>

1462
00:39:09.461 --> 00:39:11.860
<v Speaker 5>This movie's going to be big water.</v>

1463
00:39:11.890 --> 00:39:12.760
<v Speaker 5>He drowns them,</v>

1464
00:39:12.761 --> 00:39:16.840
<v Speaker 5>he rapes them and then he leaves them back to the surface in real black and</v>

1465
00:39:16.841 --> 00:39:17.300
<v Speaker 5>white.</v>

1466
00:39:17.300 --> 00:39:19.090
<v Speaker 5>Three it's going to be amazing.</v>

1467
00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:20.290
<v Speaker 5>Three d black and white.</v>

1468
00:39:20.590 --> 00:39:22.060
<v Speaker 5>That's going to be amazing.</v>

1469
00:39:22.090 --> 00:39:22.900
<v Speaker 5>Holy Shit.</v>

1470
00:39:22.900 --> 00:39:27.250
<v Speaker 5>There's no better piece of evidence about how our society has changed.</v>

1471
00:39:27.251 --> 00:39:32.080
<v Speaker 5>I think then watching our old shows and movies like try to watch father knows</v>

1472
00:39:32.081 --> 00:39:32.914
<v Speaker 5>best.</v>

1473
00:39:33.130 --> 00:39:34.300
<v Speaker 5>It's beautiful.</v>

1474
00:39:34.690 --> 00:39:36.840
<v Speaker 5>It's like you're watching a comedy like you,</v>

1475
00:39:36.841 --> 00:39:41.841
<v Speaker 5>you watch father knows best and it's so awkward and like clunky and fake and</v>

1476
00:39:45.010 --> 00:39:49.470
<v Speaker 5>like not in any way resembling how human beings really behaved.</v>

1477
00:39:49.930 --> 00:39:51.460
<v Speaker 5>It becomes a comedy.</v>

1478
00:39:51.510 --> 00:39:51.740
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1479
00:39:51.740 --> 00:39:52.540
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1480
00:39:52.540 --> 00:39:54.880
<v Speaker 5>Like you may guess it was supposed to be a comedy back then,</v>

1481
00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:55.520
<v Speaker 5>but it wasn't.</v>

1482
00:39:55.520 --> 00:39:56.321
<v Speaker 5>It wasn't.</v>

1483
00:39:56.321 --> 00:39:56.951
<v Speaker 5>It was a drama,</v>

1484
00:39:56.951 --> 00:39:57.350
<v Speaker 5>comedy,</v>

1485
00:39:57.350 --> 00:39:58.183
<v Speaker 5>drama.</v>

1486
00:39:58.720 --> 00:39:59.530
<v Speaker 5>What would you call it?</v>

1487
00:39:59.530 --> 00:40:00.221
<v Speaker 5>It was like a comedy,</v>

1488
00:40:00.221 --> 00:40:00.500
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1489
00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:01.333
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1490
00:40:01.570 --> 00:40:03.160
<v Speaker 5>It's funny for being sucky.</v>

1491
00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:05.350
<v Speaker 5>It's funny for being really stupid.</v>

1492
00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:08.650
<v Speaker 5>Well father knows best and it was fucking stupid pipe.</v>

1493
00:40:08.970 --> 00:40:11.290
<v Speaker 5>It's like the whole thing is like so weird.</v>

1494
00:40:11.380 --> 00:40:11.531
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1495
00:40:11.531 --> 00:40:12.161
<v Speaker 5>it's crazy.</v>

1496
00:40:12.161 --> 00:40:12.940
<v Speaker 5>Surreal.</v>

1497
00:40:12.940 --> 00:40:15.310
<v Speaker 5>If you watch like see if you could pull up a father knows,</v>

1498
00:40:15.940 --> 00:40:19.330
<v Speaker 5>you know it's also really bad that like shows you like,</v>

1499
00:40:19.331 --> 00:40:20.620
<v Speaker 5>it makes you think about what were,</v>

1500
00:40:20.621 --> 00:40:24.770
<v Speaker 5>what were you thinking when we saw this and where people impressed are like uh,</v>

1501
00:40:24.790 --> 00:40:25.630
<v Speaker 5>music videos.</v>

1502
00:40:25.870 --> 00:40:27.610
<v Speaker 5>If you watch old music videos and you're like,</v>

1503
00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:28.720
<v Speaker 5>Holy Shit,</v>

1504
00:40:28.721 --> 00:40:28.980
<v Speaker 5>this is,</v>

1505
00:40:28.980 --> 00:40:29.990
<v Speaker 5>oh yeah,</v>

1506
00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:32.440
<v Speaker 5>but at the time you know that they're like,</v>

1507
00:40:32.441 --> 00:40:33.274
<v Speaker 5>do you see this guy?</v>

1508
00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:37.750
<v Speaker 5>He can make his face freeze on the screen and then they'll leave it there for a</v>

1509
00:40:37.750 --> 00:40:41.230
<v Speaker 5>minute and a half while some other shit goes on behind it.</v>

1510
00:40:41.290 --> 00:40:45.310
<v Speaker 5>And that was like they were showing off the technology when they made those,</v>

1511
00:40:45.311 --> 00:40:46.460
<v Speaker 5>but they weren't even like making it.</v>

1512
00:40:46.470 --> 00:40:46.811
<v Speaker 5>They were like,</v>

1513
00:40:46.811 --> 00:40:49.690
<v Speaker 5>just look at the buttons we got with this new software.</v>

00:42:59.251 --> 00:43:00.084
<v Speaker 5>So good chicken.</v>

1596
00:43:00.090 --> 00:43:01.260
<v Speaker 5>Do you remember how racist he was?</v>

1597
00:43:01.480 --> 00:43:02.313
<v Speaker 7>Look at it.</v>

1598
00:43:02.570 --> 00:43:04.850
<v Speaker 7>This works for you and Henry.</v>

1599
00:43:04.851 --> 00:43:05.900
<v Speaker 7>You're trying to find somebody else.</v>

1600
00:43:06.520 --> 00:43:07.880
<v Speaker 7>You don't call that crooked?</v>

1601
00:43:08.050 --> 00:43:08.720
<v Speaker 7>No.</v>

<v Speaker 7>Where does that place?</v>

1604
00:43:11.121 --> 00:43:11.954
<v Speaker 7>Henry Jackson.</v>

1605
00:43:12.340 --> 00:43:13.380
<v Speaker 7>It was of a joke.</v>

1606
00:43:14.230 --> 00:43:15.320
<v Speaker 7>Why is he number two?</v>

1607
00:43:15.410 --> 00:43:16.161
<v Speaker 7>Because me,</v>

1610
00:43:17.151 --> 00:43:18.170
<v Speaker 7>Number one I want to know,</v>

<v Speaker 7>be chill.</v>

1612
00:43:18.920 --> 00:43:23.050
<v Speaker 7>I like Mae Jemison number two long before I come along I suppose,</v>

1613
00:43:23.210 --> 00:43:27.270
<v Speaker 7>but the Puerto Ricans a number three then this just showing it that a little</v>

1614
00:43:27.290 --> 00:43:27.531
<v Speaker 7>gallery,</v>

1615
00:43:27.531 --> 00:43:28.810
<v Speaker 7>your point of weakness could be fun.</v>

1616
00:43:29.570 --> 00:43:31.370
<v Speaker 7>Be Judging your change can be three,</v>

1617
00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:33.321
<v Speaker 7>three,</v>

1618
00:43:33.321 --> 00:43:34.154
<v Speaker 7>a three B.</v>

1619
00:43:37.790 --> 00:43:38.810
<v Speaker 5>It was the greatest shot.</v>

1620
00:43:38.930 --> 00:43:39.741
<v Speaker 5>He couldn't make that show.</v>

1621
00:43:39.741 --> 00:43:40.441
<v Speaker 5>Now I need to get the,</v>

1622
00:43:40.441 --> 00:43:42.230
<v Speaker 5>show me how good it is.</v>

1623
00:43:42.290 --> 00:43:42.501
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1624
00:43:42.501 --> 00:43:46.640
<v Speaker 5>I wonder if they even censored the DVDs because I mean he used,</v>

1625
00:43:46.660 --> 00:43:48.050
<v Speaker 5>oh he dropped in bombs.</v>

1626
00:43:48.051 --> 00:43:49.350
<v Speaker 5>He called everyone shakes in it.</v>

1627
00:43:50.030 --> 00:43:51.350
<v Speaker 5>We've become a bunch of pussies.</v>

1628
00:43:51.380 --> 00:43:51.680
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1629
00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:56.090
<v Speaker 5>We've become super duper sensitive pussies and you know a lot of people</v>

1630
00:43:56.091 --> 00:43:59.760
<v Speaker 5>apologizing for a lot of shit because of that you'll,</v>

1631
00:43:59.890 --> 00:44:01.580
<v Speaker 5>you'll lose out on comedy,</v>

1632
00:44:01.910 --> 00:44:02.241
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1633
00:44:02.241 --> 00:44:03.320
<v Speaker 5>because you're not,</v>

1634
00:44:03.380 --> 00:44:06.290
<v Speaker 5>you can't tell me those guys don't still exist.</v>

1635
00:44:06.350 --> 00:44:06.840
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

1636
00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:07.070
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1637
00:44:07.070 --> 00:44:09.200
<v Speaker 5>you can't tell me that racism doesn't still exist.</v>

1638
00:44:09.201 --> 00:44:09.921
<v Speaker 5>It absolutely does.</v>

1639
00:44:09.921 --> 00:44:13.790
<v Speaker 5>But I think racism in the context of a show,</v>

1640
00:44:13.791 --> 00:44:15.020
<v Speaker 5>like all in the family,</v>

1641
00:44:15.021 --> 00:44:15.721
<v Speaker 5>the way he's ready,</v>

1642
00:44:15.721 --> 00:44:17.210
<v Speaker 5>I think it helps people.</v>

1643
00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:19.390
<v Speaker 5>I think it helps people relate to it.</v>

1644
00:44:19.391 --> 00:44:23.540
<v Speaker 5>Like how he's such a moron and it makes you realize he's a fucking idiot.</v>

1645
00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:23.840
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1646
00:44:23.840 --> 00:44:26.340
<v Speaker 5>It makes you relate to how everybody else sees him.</v>

1647
00:44:26.410 --> 00:44:28.280
<v Speaker 5>It's like it's probably good for the culture.</v>

1648
00:44:28.350 --> 00:44:30.170
<v Speaker 5>Absolutely realistic about a guy like that.</v>

1649
00:44:30.171 --> 00:44:33.330
<v Speaker 5>And you even see in that character because it's so deep,</v>

1650
00:44:33.660 --> 00:44:37.470
<v Speaker 5>you actually see how it's not the only thing that defines him.</v>

1651
00:44:37.500 --> 00:44:42.090
<v Speaker 5>So you still have a soft spot in a way for this guy who has the detestable</v>

1652
00:44:42.091 --> 00:44:43.530
<v Speaker 5>aspects of his personality.</v>

1653
00:44:43.940 --> 00:44:45.210
<v Speaker 5>He also did,</v>

1654
00:44:45.211 --> 00:44:46.890
<v Speaker 5>I mean Carol O'Connor,</v>

1655
00:44:46.891 --> 00:44:49.050
<v Speaker 5>so who to play them did an amazing job.</v>

1656
00:44:49.051 --> 00:44:49.491
<v Speaker 5>A plane.</v>

1657
00:44:49.491 --> 00:44:50.190
<v Speaker 5>My God,</v>

1658
00:44:50.190 --> 00:44:53.250
<v Speaker 5>amazing job because he was a guy that clearly loved his children,</v>

1659
00:44:53.251 --> 00:44:54.510
<v Speaker 5>who wasn't a terrible person.</v>

1660
00:44:54.530 --> 00:44:55.020
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1661
00:44:55.020 --> 00:44:55.710
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1662
00:44:55.710 --> 00:44:59.760
<v Speaker 5>he was tolerant even with meathead living with him and never got violent or</v>

1663
00:44:59.761 --> 00:45:00.271
<v Speaker 5>anything like that.</v>

1664
00:45:00.271 --> 00:45:01.000
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>

1665
00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:04.010
<v Speaker 5>You can think about how a lot of fathers would have been like way more horror,</v>

1666
00:45:04.230 --> 00:45:09.230
<v Speaker 5>but it was like he also was a buffoon and that buffoonery sorta look,</v>

1667
00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:09.810
<v Speaker 5>you go,</v>

1668
00:45:09.810 --> 00:45:10.260
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

1669
00:45:10.260 --> 00:45:11.970
<v Speaker 5>that's why he's racist.</v>

1670
00:45:11.970 --> 00:45:16.620
<v Speaker 5>The same reason why he's the butt of all these jokes cause he's a buffoon and I</v>

1671
00:45:16.621 --> 00:45:17.640
<v Speaker 5>think that's a good thing.</v>

1672
00:45:17.670 --> 00:45:18.990
<v Speaker 5>I don't think that's a bad thing at all.</v>

1673
00:45:18.991 --> 00:45:19.351
<v Speaker 5>But you,</v>

1674
00:45:19.351 --> 00:45:19.771
<v Speaker 5>you're right.</v>

1675
00:45:19.771 --> 00:45:19.951
<v Speaker 5>You could.</v>

1676
00:45:19.951 --> 00:45:20.880
<v Speaker 5>We don't have that today.</v>

1677
00:45:21.770 --> 00:45:22.910
<v Speaker 5>The thing is when you cut,</v>

1678
00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:23.790
<v Speaker 5>you don't want to carry,</v>

1679
00:45:23.830 --> 00:45:25.230
<v Speaker 5>they would censor a character like that.</v>

1680
00:45:25.231 --> 00:45:30.231
<v Speaker 5>Today you're doing a disservice to just your own honesty about people because</v>

1681
00:45:30.990 --> 00:45:32.790
<v Speaker 5>you're not acknowledging that.</v>

1682
00:45:32.791 --> 00:45:33.271
<v Speaker 5>Like you said,</v>

1683
00:45:33.271 --> 00:45:34.140
<v Speaker 5>that person's out there.</v>

1684
00:45:34.290 --> 00:45:34.531
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1685
00:45:34.531 --> 00:45:37.350
<v Speaker 5>It's like how come you can acknowledge that the murderers are out there?</v>

1686
00:45:37.410 --> 00:45:41.130
<v Speaker 5>How can you can acknowledge every week on CSI that there's a crazy fucking</v>

1687
00:45:41.131 --> 00:45:42.720
<v Speaker 5>serial killer chopping up hookers.</v>

1688
00:45:42.930 --> 00:45:45.430
<v Speaker 5>You can do that every week and nobody has a problem with it.</v>

1689
00:45:45.690 --> 00:45:50.190
<v Speaker 5>But if they had one character on TV that was a racist white guy that was talking</v>

1690
00:45:50.191 --> 00:45:52.800
<v Speaker 5>shit about the chinks in the specs and it'd be like,</v>

1691
00:45:52.801 --> 00:45:53.880
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck?</v>

1692
00:45:54.300 --> 00:45:55.710
<v Speaker 5>Everybody would protest.</v>

1693
00:45:55.711 --> 00:45:59.130
<v Speaker 5>People would say they were going to boycott at Internet marketing campaigns a</v>

1694
00:45:59.131 --> 00:46:00.330
<v Speaker 5>stop the hate.</v>

1695
00:46:00.331 --> 00:46:02.610
<v Speaker 5>And when his comedy too far,</v>

1696
00:46:02.770 --> 00:46:02.900
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1697
00:46:02.900 --> 00:46:03.340
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1698
00:46:03.340 --> 00:46:06.990
<v Speaker 5>now did you see on the Superbowl the commercial that that people,</v>

1699
00:46:07.050 --> 00:46:11.760
<v Speaker 5>they didn't want it run because of the white guy do in the Jamaican accident.</v>

1700
00:46:11.761 --> 00:46:12.620
<v Speaker 5>Like that was the guy,</v>

1701
00:46:13.230 --> 00:46:17.460
<v Speaker 5>they sent out a press release about how offensive it was.</v>

1702
00:46:17.850 --> 00:46:18.780
<v Speaker 5>And um,</v>

1703
00:46:19.220 --> 00:46:19.570
<v Speaker 5>it was,</v>

1704
00:46:19.570 --> 00:46:22.260
<v Speaker 5>it was a car commercial where like the guy in Minnesota,</v>

1705
00:46:22.350 --> 00:46:22.891
<v Speaker 5>a white guy,</v>

1706
00:46:22.891 --> 00:46:24.690
<v Speaker 5>he's doing a bad or not even bad,</v>

1707
00:46:24.700 --> 00:46:24.890
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

1708
00:46:24.890 --> 00:46:27.420
<v Speaker 5>I think it's pretty decent Jamaican accent,</v>

1709
00:46:27.880 --> 00:46:28.320
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1710
00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:29.041
<v Speaker 5>throughout the commercial.</v>

1711
00:46:29.041 --> 00:46:32.640
<v Speaker 5>It's so crazy that they wanted an apology and then you have,</v>

1712
00:46:33.210 --> 00:46:33.960
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1713
00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:35.010
<v Speaker 5>at another end of that,</v>

1714
00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:37.620
<v Speaker 5>what does it JC penny is trying to get,</v>

1715
00:46:37.621 --> 00:46:38.454
<v Speaker 5>was trying to get,</v>

1716
00:46:38.460 --> 00:46:39.293
<v Speaker 5>or Sears,</v>

1717
00:46:39.670 --> 00:46:40.320
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1718
00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:41.000
<v Speaker 5>has,</v>

1719
00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:41.310
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1720
00:46:41.310 --> 00:46:45.000
<v Speaker 5>Ellen's generous as a spokeswoman and then there's protesters.</v>

1721
00:46:45.270 --> 00:46:45.690
<v Speaker 5>They're like,</v>

1722
00:46:45.690 --> 00:46:46.590
<v Speaker 5>we don't want,</v>

1723
00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:49.500
<v Speaker 5>you just lost a dollar for hiring her.</v>

1724
00:46:49.990 --> 00:46:50.530
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1725
00:46:50.530 --> 00:46:53.560
<v Speaker 5>they weren't good and we don't want your flooring dollar.</v>

1726
00:46:54.150 --> 00:46:57.270
<v Speaker 5>And they would get more people supporting them wherever they're going to lose</v>

1727
00:46:57.271 --> 00:47:00.210
<v Speaker 5>for those people that are not going to get back unless they stand up for it.</v>

1728
00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:00.600
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1729
00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:02.070
<v Speaker 5>And then talk about a fucking stupid,</v>

1730
00:47:02.071 --> 00:47:03.060
<v Speaker 5>that's what do you watching Brian?</v>

1731
00:47:03.090 --> 00:47:03.811
<v Speaker 5>That's the commercial.</v>

1732
00:47:03.811 --> 00:47:04.860
<v Speaker 5>He wasn't just talking about,</v>

1733
00:47:04.950 --> 00:47:06.570
<v Speaker 5>oh look how look this is what they,</v>

1734
00:47:06.571 --> 00:47:07.360
<v Speaker 5>these people wanted.</v>

1735
00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:07.910

1744
00:47:19.270 --> 00:47:20.103
<v Speaker 9>Yes.</v>

00:47:24.270 --> 00:47:25.140
<v Speaker 9>So in conclusion,</v>

1748
00:47:25.800 --> 00:47:27.060
<v Speaker 9>things are pretty dismal.</v>

1749

<v Speaker 9>You know what?</v>

1750

<v Speaker 9>This room needs a smile.</v>

00:47:53.570 --> 00:47:54.030
<v Speaker 4>they were like,</v>

1761

<v Speaker 4>Prejudice commercial.</v>

1765
00:47:58.621 --> 00:47:59.280
<v Speaker 4>My God.</v>

1766
00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:02.190
<v Speaker 4>And you need to pull this shit down.</v>

1767
00:48:02.220 --> 00:48:03.053
<v Speaker 4>That's hilarious.</v>

1768
00:48:03.210 --> 00:48:04.900
<v Speaker 4>So what was the name of the group that wanted to pull it?</v>

1769
00:48:05.470 --> 00:48:06.810
<v Speaker 4>If you did a Google search for it?</v>

1770
00:48:07.070 --> 00:48:07.650

1779
00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:19.230
<v Speaker 4>and then everybody was anticipating because that new story came out before the</v>

00:48:55.170 --> 00:48:56.460
<v Speaker 2>all right enough with that.</v>

1804
00:48:56.810 --> 00:48:58.590
<v Speaker 2>People are so fucking sensitive.</v>

1805
00:48:58.680 --> 00:48:59.700
<v Speaker 2>They're so stupid.</v>

1806
00:49:00.240 --> 00:49:00.870
<v Speaker 2>Someone,</v>

1807
00:49:00.870 --> 00:49:04.950
<v Speaker 2>someone wrote some blog about what's his face that did the Oscars?</v>

<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1810
00:49:06.630 --> 00:49:07.710
<v Speaker 2>Apparently said something about,</v>

1811
00:49:07.711 --> 00:49:09.510
<v Speaker 2>nobody can understand sound behind but,</v>

1812
00:49:09.600 --> 00:49:11.460
<v Speaker 2>but no one cares because she's so hot.</v>

1813
00:49:12.120 --> 00:49:12.750
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of funny.</v>

1814
00:49:12.750 --> 00:49:13.350
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

1815
00:49:13.350 --> 00:49:14.490
<v Speaker 2>It's not offensive.</v>

1816
00:49:14.550 --> 00:49:14.680
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1819
00:49:18.241 --> 00:49:22.830
<v Speaker 2>so what you're basically saying is that her opinion is invalid.</v>

1820
00:49:22.831 --> 00:49:27.510
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter if she's communicating because you find her attractive and you</v>

1821
00:49:27.511 --> 00:49:29.130
<v Speaker 2>can't understand it because she's Hispanic.</v>

1822
00:49:29.250 --> 00:49:31.350
<v Speaker 2>Like w w what you're,</v>

1823
00:49:31.380 --> 00:49:32.730
<v Speaker 2>it's a comedy joke.</v>

1824
00:49:32.731 --> 00:49:33.421
<v Speaker 2>It's a joke.</v>

1825
00:49:33.421 --> 00:49:37.410
<v Speaker 2>You fuckhead you got damped supersensitive shit.</v>

1826
00:49:37.411 --> 00:49:37.960
<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>

1827
00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:39.880
<v Speaker 4>It's the worst that is ruining,</v>

1828
00:49:40.300 --> 00:49:42.460
<v Speaker 4>that's ruining the fun and it's ruining life.</v>

1829
00:49:42.490 --> 00:49:42.691
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

1830
00:49:42.691 --> 00:49:43.524
<v Speaker 4>and just,</v>

1831
00:49:43.750 --> 00:49:44.210
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

00:49:44.210 --> 00:49:44.390
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

1833
00:49:44.390 --> 00:49:44.611
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1834
00:49:44.611 --> 00:49:46.690
<v Speaker 4>it's going to ruin communication between people.</v>

1835
00:49:46.720 --> 00:49:50.050
<v Speaker 4>Is that type of reaction did you see with a,</v>

1836
00:49:50.080 --> 00:49:51.160
<v Speaker 4>like what Espn,</v>

1837
00:49:51.250 --> 00:49:51.490
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1838
00:49:51.490 --> 00:49:55.840
<v Speaker 4>they issued an apology on behalf of Brent Musburger for the national</v>

1839
00:49:55.841 --> 00:50:00.010
<v Speaker 4>championship game when he commented on Aging Mclaren's girlfriend and just like,</v>

1840
00:50:00.011 --> 00:50:00.844
<v Speaker 4>yes.</v>

1841
00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:02.060
<v Speaker 4>And you watch him like he has,</v>

1842
00:50:02.260 --> 00:50:03.530
<v Speaker 4>you want him to apologize.</v>

1843
00:50:03.531 --> 00:50:05.080
<v Speaker 4>She said she was pretty,</v>

1844
00:50:05.200 --> 00:50:06.460
<v Speaker 4>like when you put a woman,</v>

1845
00:50:06.520 --> 00:50:06.900
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1846
00:50:06.900 --> 00:50:07.190
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

1847
00:50:07.190 --> 00:50:08.770
<v Speaker 4>you starting quarterbacks get all the,</v>

1848
00:50:08.830 --> 00:50:10.480
<v Speaker 4>like the beautiful ones.</v>

1849
00:50:10.540 --> 00:50:14.320
<v Speaker 4>And then I bet there's a lot of young boys out there in Alabama right now that</v>

1850
00:50:14.321 --> 00:50:16.030
<v Speaker 4>just started throwing the ball around,</v>

1851
00:50:16.060 --> 00:50:17.230
<v Speaker 4>just warming their arm up,</v>

1852
00:50:17.231 --> 00:50:17.711
<v Speaker 4>getting ready,</v>

1853
00:50:17.711 --> 00:50:18.030
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

1854
00:50:18.030 --> 00:50:18.550
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1855
00:50:18.550 --> 00:50:19.570
<v Speaker 4>What's wrong with that?</v>

1856
00:50:19.780 --> 00:50:20.640
<v Speaker 4>It's he,</v>

1857
00:50:20.740 --> 00:50:21.130
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1858
00:50:21.130 --> 00:50:26.130
<v Speaker 4>the implication is that she is only with him because he's who he is and that,</v>

1859
00:50:27.290 --> 00:50:31.190
<v Speaker 4>that he only sees in her beauty because that's all Brent Musburger talked about</v>

1860
00:50:31.430 --> 00:50:32.960
<v Speaker 4>was how beautiful she was.</v>

1861
00:50:33.290 --> 00:50:38.290
<v Speaker 4>And you know how she's not just a piece of meat and people wrote articles and</v>

1862
00:50:38.361 --> 00:50:42.560
<v Speaker 4>had their opinions about how unbelievably offended they were.</v>

1863
00:50:42.561 --> 00:50:43.910
<v Speaker 4>That Brent Musburger was like,</v>

1864
00:50:44.150 --> 00:50:44.660
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>

1865
00:50:44.660 --> 00:50:48.830
<v Speaker 4>what a beautiful woman to this obviously gorgeous woman that is standing there</v>

1866
00:50:48.831 --> 00:50:51.320
<v Speaker 4>that anybody's reaction would be,</v>

1867
00:50:51.470 --> 00:50:52.130
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>

1868
00:50:52.130 --> 00:50:53.030
<v Speaker 4>what a beautiful woman.</v>

1869
00:50:53.031 --> 00:50:53.720
<v Speaker 4>She is.</v>

1870
00:50:53.720 --> 00:50:54.201
<v Speaker 4>Not like,</v>

1871
00:50:54.201 --> 00:50:54.681
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>

1872
00:50:54.681 --> 00:50:56.480
<v Speaker 4>I wonder what her thoughts are right now.</v>

1873
00:50:58.940 --> 00:51:00.320
<v Speaker 2>It's so hilarious.</v>

1874
00:51:00.530 --> 00:51:03.680
<v Speaker 2>People are so silly and the real problem is,</v>

1875
00:51:03.681 --> 00:51:04.210
<v Speaker 2>and other people,</v>

1876
00:51:04.210 --> 00:51:05.090
<v Speaker 2>but listening to them,</v>

1877
00:51:05.150 --> 00:51:05.990
<v Speaker 2>that's the real problem.</v>

1878
00:51:05.991 --> 00:51:06.824
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>

1879
00:51:07.010 --> 00:51:07.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1880
00:51:07.490 --> 00:51:09.140
<v Speaker 2>it's a real problem is that they can,</v>

1881
00:51:09.230 --> 00:51:12.650
<v Speaker 2>they can protest and they don't get mocked the way they would in your house,</v>

1882
00:51:12.980 --> 00:51:14.180
<v Speaker 2>the way they would in your neighborhood,</v>

1883
00:51:14.181 --> 00:51:15.920
<v Speaker 2>the way they would in a normal,</v>

1884
00:51:16.130 --> 00:51:17.210
<v Speaker 2>healthy community.</v>

1885
00:51:17.610 --> 00:51:18.470
<v Speaker 2>Someone brought that up.</v>

1886
00:51:18.471 --> 00:51:18.951
<v Speaker 2>He'd be like,</v>

1887
00:51:18.951 --> 00:51:20.750
<v Speaker 2>shut him the fuck out of here.</v>

1888
00:51:20.751 --> 00:51:21.830
<v Speaker 2>He crazy asshole.</v>

1889
00:51:21.860 --> 00:51:22.693
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1890
00:51:22.790 --> 00:51:24.860
<v Speaker 2>But because of the fact that they know that they can,</v>

1891
00:51:24.980 --> 00:51:25.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1892
00:51:25.460 --> 00:51:28.850
<v Speaker 2>could you imagine if like someone in your neighborhood was a,</v>

1893
00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:33.950
<v Speaker 2>a guy and he had a beautiful wife and you knew that he was a football player and</v>

1894
00:51:33.951 --> 00:51:36.620
<v Speaker 2>so we were all sitting around and you're like somewhere guys are warming their</v>

1895
00:51:36.621 --> 00:51:37.041
<v Speaker 2>arms up,</v>

1896
00:51:37.041 --> 00:51:38.060
<v Speaker 2>looking at her like,</v>

1897
00:51:38.780 --> 00:51:39.650
<v Speaker 2>can I get to be one of those?</v>

1898
00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:40.880
<v Speaker 2>You'd laugh at that guy.</v>

1899
00:51:42.200 --> 00:51:43.033
<v Speaker 2>He's silly.</v>

1900
00:51:43.160 --> 00:51:43.710
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

1901
00:51:43.710 --> 00:51:44.543
<v Speaker 2>Like</v>

1902
00:51:45.710 --> 00:51:48.950
<v Speaker 2>people are actually genuinely pretending to be upset.</v>

1903
00:51:49.360 --> 00:51:49.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1904
00:51:49.880 --> 00:51:51.020
<v Speaker 2>We can't be actually upset.</v>

1905
00:51:51.140 --> 00:51:53.180
<v Speaker 2>You're upset at the world if you're upset at that,</v>

1906
00:51:53.181 --> 00:51:53.940
<v Speaker 2>you're not really yes.</v>

1907
00:51:53.940 --> 00:51:56.490
<v Speaker 4>Because you're really focusing on something that is,</v>

1908
00:51:56.610 --> 00:51:58.260
<v Speaker 4>it's even less than important.</v>

1909
00:51:58.290 --> 00:51:58.631
<v Speaker 4>Like it,</v>

1910
00:51:58.631 --> 00:52:03.360
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't even belong in that like circle of conversation.</v>

1911
00:52:03.480 --> 00:52:04.470
<v Speaker 4>This is not an issue.</v>

1912
00:52:04.680 --> 00:52:06.060
<v Speaker 4>You're wasting your time.</v>

1913
00:52:06.270 --> 00:52:07.110
<v Speaker 4>And we all know it.</v>

1914
00:52:07.140 --> 00:52:07.791
<v Speaker 4>That's why we get,</v>

1915
00:52:07.791 --> 00:52:08.624
<v Speaker 4>we get upset about it.</v>

1916
00:52:08.640 --> 00:52:13.640
<v Speaker 4>By that we know that you're wasting everybody's time to ask for apologies for</v>

1917
00:52:13.891 --> 00:52:16.110
<v Speaker 4>something that you might interpret coming out.</v>

1918
00:52:16.170 --> 00:52:18.630
<v Speaker 4>Like if it's not even a direct statement.</v>

1919
00:52:19.020 --> 00:52:19.853
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1920
00:52:20.280 --> 00:52:21.113
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1921
00:52:21.130 --> 00:52:21.560
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1922
00:52:21.560 --> 00:52:26.560
<v Speaker 2>it's a weird thing that's going on where we've been around for so long and</v>

1923
00:52:26.851 --> 00:52:29.520
<v Speaker 2>comedy in this offensive comedy has been around for so long.</v>

1924
00:52:29.760 --> 00:52:31.920
<v Speaker 2>But there's this new thing,</v>

1925
00:52:31.921 --> 00:52:36.300
<v Speaker 2>this righteous indignation that people were claiming now more than ever where</v>

1926
00:52:36.301 --> 00:52:38.820
<v Speaker 2>they're pretending that there's not a,</v>

1927
00:52:38.821 --> 00:52:43.560
<v Speaker 2>a joking context to a lot of this stuff that let that joking context doesn't</v>

1928
00:52:43.561 --> 00:52:44.220
<v Speaker 2>even exist.</v>

1929
00:52:44.220 --> 00:52:44.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1930
00:52:44.710 --> 00:52:45.241
<v Speaker 2>it's joking.</v>

1931
00:52:45.241 --> 00:52:48.360
<v Speaker 2>Context doesn't exist and they'll take a joke as a statement.</v>

1932
00:52:48.510 --> 00:52:53.510
<v Speaker 2>Did you know that he said he would like to see the queen getting eaten out by a</v>

1933
00:52:53.911 --> 00:52:54.930
<v Speaker 2>hot 20 year old?</v>

1934
00:52:55.170 --> 00:52:57.420
<v Speaker 2>Cause I said that once I was talking about the queen.</v>

1935
00:52:57.421 --> 00:52:57.871
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1936
00:52:57.871 --> 00:52:58.101
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1937
00:52:58.101 --> 00:52:59.730
<v Speaker 2>she's probably a nice old lady.</v>

1938
00:52:59.731 --> 00:53:01.860
<v Speaker 2>Well wouldn't it be great if she was a lesbian?</v>

1939
00:53:01.980 --> 00:53:02.813
<v Speaker 2>I mean wouldn't that be like,</v>

1940
00:53:03.050 --> 00:53:03.541
<v Speaker 2>cause if you,</v>

1941
00:53:03.541 --> 00:53:04.140
<v Speaker 2>if you know,</v>

1942
00:53:04.140 --> 00:53:06.840
<v Speaker 2>if you made now if someone just look at that,</v>

1943
00:53:06.841 --> 00:53:09.810
<v Speaker 2>oh Joe Rogan was hoping the Queen get eaten out by hot 20 year old.</v>

1944
00:53:09.980 --> 00:53:12.600
<v Speaker 2>You do you have a put that in the paper in England they would go crazy.</v>

1945
00:53:12.720 --> 00:53:13.740
<v Speaker 2>Like what are you saying?</v>

1946
00:53:14.440 --> 00:53:14.820
<v Speaker 2>Obviously,</v>

1947
00:53:14.820 --> 00:53:16.740
<v Speaker 2>I don't really mean that these are the jokes,</v>

1948
00:53:17.030 --> 00:53:22.030
<v Speaker 2>but t to cut out that aspect of communication is to pretend it's like you're</v>

1949
00:53:22.951 --> 00:53:23.784
<v Speaker 2>playing dumb.</v>

1950
00:53:24.090 --> 00:53:24.950
<v Speaker 2>Like you don't think so.</v>

1951
00:53:24.970 --> 00:53:26.140
<v Speaker 2>You might not think it's funny,</v>

1952
00:53:26.380 --> 00:53:28.210
<v Speaker 2>but you know the difference between someone jokes</v>

1953
00:53:28.310 --> 00:53:31.800
<v Speaker 4>around and a very casual joke around,</v>

1954
00:53:31.801 --> 00:53:35.340
<v Speaker 4>by the way about a girl being attractive and guys are warming up their arms,</v>

1955
00:53:35.670 --> 00:53:38.470
<v Speaker 4>throwing the ball around cause they'd like to have an attractive girlfriend.</v>

1956
00:53:38.500 --> 00:53:40.920
<v Speaker 4>Like are we pretending that we don't like attractive people?</v>

1957
00:53:40.950 --> 00:53:41.461
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

1958
00:53:41.461 --> 00:53:42.140
<v Speaker 4>Like what did we,</v>

1959
00:53:42.140 --> 00:53:43.080
<v Speaker 4>what did we mad at?</v>

1960
00:53:43.110 --> 00:53:43.350
<v Speaker 4>Or,</v>

1961
00:53:43.350 --> 00:53:45.930
<v Speaker 4>and we're also pretending that like if,</v>

1962
00:53:46.080 --> 00:53:51.080
<v Speaker 4>if you're factoring in and attractive persons attractive attraction level,</v>

1963
00:53:51.840 --> 00:53:54.530
<v Speaker 4>then that is a cheap and,</v>

1964
00:53:54.540 --> 00:53:56.100
<v Speaker 4>and shortsighted of you.</v>

1965
00:53:56.130 --> 00:53:58.080
<v Speaker 4>Like what about the other,</v>

1966
00:53:58.110 --> 00:53:58.590
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1967
00:53:58.590 --> 00:53:59.940
<v Speaker 4>factors about this person,</v>

1968
00:54:00.120 --> 00:54:00.541
<v Speaker 4>but you're like,</v>

1969
00:54:00.541 --> 00:54:00.840
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1970
00:54:00.840 --> 00:54:05.040
<v Speaker 4>why are we going to pretend like they're level of attraction isn't a factor.</v>

1971
00:54:05.100 --> 00:54:06.210
<v Speaker 4>It's a real factor.</v>

1972
00:54:06.280 --> 00:54:07.113
<v Speaker 4>It's gonna.</v>

1973
00:54:07.320 --> 00:54:09.840
<v Speaker 4>It's gonna determine a lot of things in that person's life.</v>

1974
00:54:09.870 --> 00:54:10.320
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1975
00:54:10.320 --> 00:54:10.621
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1976
00:54:10.621 --> 00:54:13.200
<v Speaker 4>and we're going to just ignore that because they're attractive.</v>

1977
00:54:13.230 --> 00:54:14.010
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1978
00:54:14.010 --> 00:54:14.370
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1979
00:54:14.370 --> 00:54:15.203
<v Speaker 4>Come on.</v>

1980
00:54:15.360 --> 00:54:16.193
<v Speaker 4>So stupid.</v>

1981
00:54:18.210 --> 00:54:19.710
<v Speaker 4>Just like ugly people don't have a good,</v>

1982
00:54:19.711 --> 00:54:19.981
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1983
00:54:19.981 --> 00:54:20.970
<v Speaker 4>we can talk about that.</v>

1984
00:54:21.120 --> 00:54:21.900
<v Speaker 4>There's real,</v>

1985
00:54:21.900 --> 00:54:22.830
<v Speaker 4>it's fucking real.</v>

1986
00:54:22.831 --> 00:54:23.431
<v Speaker 4>It's a shit.</v>

1987
00:54:23.431 --> 00:54:24.940
<v Speaker 4>Roll the dice and you all know it.</v>

1988
00:54:25.030 --> 00:54:25.863
<v Speaker 3>Goddammit.</v>

1989
00:54:26.090 --> 00:54:27.390
<v Speaker 3>Trent Reznor his wife.</v>

1990
00:54:27.610 --> 00:54:29.220
<v Speaker 3>I just found out about her.</v>

1991
00:54:29.250 --> 00:54:29.820
<v Speaker 3>Look at her.</v>

1992
00:54:29.820 --> 00:54:30.690
<v Speaker 3>She is the most,</v>

1993
00:54:31.140 --> 00:54:33.060
<v Speaker 3>I found out about her music and then I was like,</v>

1994
00:54:33.080 --> 00:54:34.380
<v Speaker 3>well I need to find out who this is.</v>

1995
00:54:34.381 --> 00:54:35.820
<v Speaker 3>I need to stop soccer boy.</v>

1996
00:54:36.350 --> 00:54:36.510
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1997
00:54:36.510 --> 00:54:37.231
<v Speaker 3>I need to stock her.</v>

1998
00:54:37.231 --> 00:54:39.420
<v Speaker 3>And then I found I was turning this resonance wife,</v>

1999
00:54:39.510 --> 00:54:42.990
<v Speaker 3>but her music is like pink Floyd mixed with electronic music.</v>

2000
00:54:42.991 --> 00:54:43.860
<v Speaker 3>It's really good.</v>

2001
00:54:43.861 --> 00:54:44.460
<v Speaker 3>I haven't read,</v>

2002
00:54:44.460 --> 00:54:45.293
<v Speaker 3>what's her name?</v>

2003
00:54:45.920 --> 00:54:46.440
<v Speaker 3>Her bed.</v>

2004
00:54:46.440 --> 00:54:48.810
<v Speaker 3>Her bands called how to destroy angels.</v>

2005
00:54:49.350 --> 00:54:50.940
<v Speaker 3>They have a new CD that just came out today.</v>

2006
00:54:51.060 --> 00:54:52.140
<v Speaker 3>That sounds like an angry bitch.</v>

2007
00:54:53.070 --> 00:54:54.460
<v Speaker 3>And then I tweeted,</v>

2008
00:54:54.510 --> 00:54:55.890
<v Speaker 3>I tweeted how much I like it.</v>

2009
00:54:55.950 --> 00:54:57.270
<v Speaker 3>And then all these people are look good.</v>

2010
00:54:57.271 --> 00:55:00.300
<v Speaker 3>She's the new Yoko Ono if she killed nine snails.</v>

2011
00:55:00.770 --> 00:55:01.603
<v Speaker 3>Huh.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Some of what she's saying I agree with,</v>

2022
00:55:18.880 --> 00:55:23.620
<v Speaker 2>you know she's saying she's sick of people saying things that are racist and</v>

2023
00:55:23.621 --> 00:55:28.621
<v Speaker 2>sexist and that someone saying it's just comedy somehow gives you a free pass.</v>

2024
00:55:29.740 --> 00:55:31.030
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't give you a free pass.</v>

2025
00:55:31.120 --> 00:55:31.630
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>

2026
00:55:31.630 --> 00:55:32.463
<v Speaker 2>I agree with that.</v>

2027
00:55:32.710 --> 00:55:33.101
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

2028
00:55:33.101 --> 00:55:35.190
<v Speaker 2>it does give you a free pass if it's funny.</v>

2029
00:55:35.200 --> 00:55:35.730
<v Speaker 2>It's funny.</v>

2030
00:55:35.730 --> 00:55:36.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2031
00:55:36.460 --> 00:55:36.930
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>

2032
00:55:36.930 --> 00:55:38.260
<v Speaker 2>that's what she's missing.</v>

2033
00:55:38.650 --> 00:55:42.940
<v Speaker 2>Like if someone says something fucked up and racist but hilarious.</v>

2034
00:55:42.980 --> 00:55:43.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2035
00:55:43.300 --> 00:55:44.140
<v Speaker 2>you can say that.</v>

2036
00:55:44.290 --> 00:55:44.920
<v Speaker 2>You can say it,</v>

2037
00:55:44.920 --> 00:55:49.080
<v Speaker 2>you can say it as long as I know that you're just joking and there's this</v>

2038
00:55:49.280 --> 00:55:52.750
<v Speaker 2>certain shit like you'll do like yo like crack like this fucked up the half</v>

2039
00:55:52.751 --> 00:55:55.780
<v Speaker 2>smile and you'll say something and I know you're bullshitting.</v>

2040
00:55:55.820 --> 00:55:56.111
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>

2041
00:55:56.111 --> 00:56:00.160
<v Speaker 2>you're like doing a joke to me and I know you're doing it and I'll laugh my ass</v>

2042
00:56:00.161 --> 00:56:03.220
<v Speaker 2>off because I know you really don't mean this mean thing that you're saying,</v>

2043
00:56:03.460 --> 00:56:06.160
<v Speaker 2>but you'll say it joking and like just say that smile.</v>

2044
00:56:06.161 --> 00:56:07.570
<v Speaker 2>It's like you can't quite,</v>

2045
00:56:08.150 --> 00:56:08.983
<v Speaker 2>it's fun.</v>

2046
00:56:09.160 --> 00:56:11.650
<v Speaker 2>It's a fun thing to do and it's not reality.</v>

2047
00:56:11.651 --> 00:56:13.480
<v Speaker 2>It's not like a statement on things.</v>

2048
00:56:14.080 --> 00:56:18.670
<v Speaker 2>The idea that joking doesn't exist or the idea that something that is fucking</v>

2049
00:56:18.671 --> 00:56:23.671
<v Speaker 2>hilarious shouldn't be said because it's also racist or it's also is that's so</v>

2050
00:56:24.761 --> 00:56:25.480
<v Speaker 2>silly.</v>

2051
00:56:25.480 --> 00:56:28.210
<v Speaker 2>I mean can I tell you too that I feel like the,</v>

2052
00:56:28.240 --> 00:56:32.800
<v Speaker 2>they're basically our two groups as far as who gets like your point,</v>

2053
00:56:32.801 --> 00:56:37.801
<v Speaker 2>what you're saying and then who gets upset by it and it's almost almost split</v>

2054
00:56:38.261 --> 00:56:42.820
<v Speaker 2>down the line of intelligent and not so intelligent that we're as intelligent</v>

2055
00:56:42.821 --> 00:56:43.180
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

2056
00:56:43.180 --> 00:56:46.690
<v Speaker 2>I feel like get what you joking.</v>

2057
00:56:47.080 --> 00:56:49.720
<v Speaker 2>They get joking around that people who are a little bit,</v>

2058
00:56:50.110 --> 00:56:50.501
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2059
00:56:50.501 --> 00:56:53.530
<v Speaker 2>and then that breaking it down to like an Iq level but they're like,</v>

2060
00:56:53.531 --> 00:56:55.000
<v Speaker 2>do you not get this right now?</v>

2061
00:56:55.060 --> 00:56:55.751
<v Speaker 2>I agree with you.</v>

2062
00:56:55.751 --> 00:56:56.561
<v Speaker 2>To a certain extent.</v>

2063
00:56:56.561 --> 00:56:59.530
<v Speaker 2>But I also think that there's one other segment that you have to address and</v>

2064
00:56:59.531 --> 00:57:01.390
<v Speaker 2>that is unhappy people.</v>

2065
00:57:01.450 --> 00:57:02.140
<v Speaker 2>That's very true.</v>

2066
00:57:02.140 --> 00:57:06.490
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of smart people that are fucking miserable and they want to</v>

2067
00:57:06.491 --> 00:57:07.870
<v Speaker 2>complain about anything they can.</v>

2068
00:57:08.020 --> 00:57:10.930
<v Speaker 2>And anytime they think they have the red light or the green light to go,</v>

2069
00:57:11.020 --> 00:57:11.771
<v Speaker 2>they will just go,</v>

2070
00:57:11.771 --> 00:57:12.011
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2071
00:57:12.011 --> 00:57:13.210
<v Speaker 2>The country is shit.</v>

2072
00:57:13.211 --> 00:57:16.690
<v Speaker 2>They can fucking think up because they've been looking for a green light.</v>

2073
00:57:16.720 --> 00:57:19.240
<v Speaker 2>They've been looking for a chance to get pissed about something.</v>

2074
00:57:19.510 --> 00:57:23.560
<v Speaker 2>And if you say these x words in a row and they know that this is a green light,</v>

2075
00:57:23.561 --> 00:57:24.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm going after this fuck.</v>

2076
00:57:24.580 --> 00:57:25.900
<v Speaker 2>And I just find the angle,</v>

2077
00:57:25.901 --> 00:57:30.520
<v Speaker 2>what's the angle to attack him and how he believes slavery should be back in</v>

2078
00:57:30.521 --> 00:57:31.181
<v Speaker 2>season.</v>

2079
00:57:31.181 --> 00:57:32.500
<v Speaker 2>You believe what?</v>

2080
00:57:32.501 --> 00:57:32.890
<v Speaker 2>This per,</v>

2081
00:57:32.890 --> 00:57:34.590
<v Speaker 2>I cannot leave yet.</v>

2082
00:57:34.660 --> 00:57:35.950
<v Speaker 2>I just indignation.</v>

2083
00:57:35.951 --> 00:57:36.521
<v Speaker 2>And you know what?</v>

2084
00:57:36.521 --> 00:57:38.620
<v Speaker 2>You make a good point because the,</v>

2085
00:57:38.621 --> 00:57:41.590
<v Speaker 2>that can be either a smart or a dumb person that,</v>

2086
00:57:41.740 --> 00:57:42.191
<v Speaker 2>and they're,</v>

2087
00:57:42.191 --> 00:57:43.720
<v Speaker 2>and they're often smart,</v>

2088
00:57:43.721 --> 00:57:44.440
<v Speaker 2>often smart,</v>

2089
00:57:44.440 --> 00:57:45.161
<v Speaker 2>and that when they,</v>

2090
00:57:45.161 --> 00:57:46.090
<v Speaker 2>if they do get happy,</v>

2091
00:57:46.400 --> 00:57:46.840
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2092
00:57:46.840 --> 00:57:48.610
<v Speaker 2>you get to experience like,</v>

2093
00:57:48.611 --> 00:57:49.180
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2094
00:57:49.180 --> 00:57:50.260
<v Speaker 2>whether they're smart or dumb,</v>

2095
00:57:50.730 --> 00:57:51.580
<v Speaker 2>I totally different person.</v>

2096
00:57:51.610 --> 00:57:52.001
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2097
00:57:52.001 --> 00:57:52.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2098
00:57:52.390 --> 00:57:52.691
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2099
00:57:52.691 --> 00:57:52.931
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2100
00:57:52.931 --> 00:57:53.201
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2101
00:57:53.201 --> 00:57:54.100
<v Speaker 2>You're more joyful.</v>

2102
00:57:54.101 --> 00:57:59.101
<v Speaker 2>And we have another problem with people that are really smart is that they</v>

2103
00:57:59.111 --> 00:58:01.210
<v Speaker 2>recognize the variables.</v>

2104
00:58:01.450 --> 00:58:04.090
<v Speaker 2>They recognize the consequences of failure.</v>

2105
00:58:04.180 --> 00:58:08.380
<v Speaker 2>They recognize the consequences of their own laziness or whatever it is that's</v>

2106
00:58:08.381 --> 00:58:10.360
<v Speaker 2>kept them from being successful.</v>

2107
00:58:10.570 --> 00:58:14.590
<v Speaker 2>They are frustrated by their own inability to reach their potential in life.</v>

2108
00:58:14.950 --> 00:58:17.350
<v Speaker 2>So then when they find a green light,</v>

2109
00:58:17.351 --> 00:58:19.000
<v Speaker 2>like it's Catholic fall and telling jokes,</v>

2110
00:58:19.001 --> 00:58:21.070
<v Speaker 2>the Oscars like they're frustrated.</v>

2111
00:58:21.160 --> 00:58:21.371
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

2112
00:58:21.371 --> 00:58:21.670
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

2113
00:58:21.670 --> 00:58:26.670
<v Speaker 2>Already and smart and go find something to attack when you're really sort of</v>

2114
00:58:27.971 --> 00:58:29.170
<v Speaker 2>projecting some,</v>

2115
00:58:29.230 --> 00:58:32.390
<v Speaker 2>some of your internal bullshit on it,</v>

2116
00:58:32.400 --> 00:58:33.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2117
00:58:33.010 --> 00:58:34.330
<v Speaker 2>a silly subject.</v>

2118
00:58:34.331 --> 00:58:36.400
<v Speaker 2>Him saying that Salma Hayek is hot,</v>

2119
00:58:36.401 --> 00:58:38.200
<v Speaker 2>so no one cares that you can understand her.</v>

2120
00:58:38.350 --> 00:58:39.250
<v Speaker 2>That's what,</v>

2121
00:58:39.251 --> 00:58:41.230
<v Speaker 2>that's what's horrible about that.</v>

2122
00:58:41.380 --> 00:58:42.520
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever heard her talk,</v>

2123
00:58:42.760 --> 00:58:45.820
<v Speaker 2>Jesus fucking Christ and we pretended that she's easy to understand.</v>

2124
00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:47.620
<v Speaker 2>Are you really going to pretend that that's a good,</v>

2125
00:58:47.890 --> 00:58:50.140
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the dual Mr Jaws.</v>

2126
00:58:50.170 --> 00:58:50.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2127
00:58:50.560 --> 00:58:52.450
<v Speaker 2>She's fucking really hard to understand.</v>

2128
00:58:52.520 --> 00:58:53.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2129
00:58:53.050 --> 00:58:53.530
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>

2130
00:58:53.530 --> 00:58:55.090
<v Speaker 2>And she's also really hot as fuck.</v>

2131
00:58:55.120 --> 00:58:55.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2132
00:58:55.480 --> 00:58:56.440
<v Speaker 2>I've met her in real life.</v>

2133
00:58:56.441 --> 00:58:57.101
<v Speaker 2>She's beautiful.</v>

2134
00:58:57.101 --> 00:58:57.491
<v Speaker 2>She's very,</v>

2135
00:58:57.491 --> 00:58:58.000
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

2136
00:58:58.000 --> 00:58:59.590
<v Speaker 2>she was on that and here comes the boom movie.</v>

2137
00:59:00.100 --> 00:59:00.641
<v Speaker 2>She's beautiful.</v>

2138
00:59:00.641 --> 00:59:01.331
<v Speaker 2>She's smoking,</v>

2139
00:59:01.331 --> 00:59:01.931
<v Speaker 2>but why would it,</v>

2140
00:59:01.931 --> 00:59:04.930
<v Speaker 2>why would she be upset that she's hard to understand really?</v>

2141
00:59:05.530 --> 00:59:07.180
<v Speaker 2>If it didn't make sense,</v>

2142
00:59:07.181 --> 00:59:08.380
<v Speaker 2>it wouldn't be funny.</v>

2143
00:59:08.470 --> 00:59:09.303
<v Speaker 2>For the record,</v>

2144
00:59:09.310 --> 00:59:11.650
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to fill her up and seal her shut.</v>

2145
00:59:11.680 --> 00:59:12.311
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2146
00:59:12.311 --> 00:59:12.760
<v Speaker 2>On the height.</v>

2147
00:59:12.760 --> 00:59:13.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2148
00:59:13.090 --> 00:59:16.750
<v Speaker 2>I would like to fill her up with so much come that she could float in the ocean.</v>

2149
00:59:18.970 --> 00:59:19.803
<v Speaker 2>She would just,</v>

2150
00:59:20.020 --> 00:59:21.400
<v Speaker 2>she would be,</v>

2151
00:59:21.410 --> 00:59:22.260
<v Speaker 2>she's so buoyant.</v>

2152
00:59:22.261 --> 00:59:22.951
<v Speaker 2>They don't even know why.</v>

2153
00:59:22.951 --> 00:59:23.784
<v Speaker 2>I would like her to have</v>

2154
00:59:23.810 --> 00:59:28.550
<v Speaker 4>so much common hurt that it's dripping out of her nose and she uses it as</v>

2155
00:59:28.551 --> 00:59:29.384
<v Speaker 4>seasoning on her talk.</v>

2156
00:59:30.010 --> 00:59:30.521
<v Speaker 2>And you know what?</v>

2157
00:59:30.521 --> 00:59:32.590
<v Speaker 2>This dummy that wrote this needs to understand,</v>

2158
00:59:33.010 --> 00:59:33.970
<v Speaker 2>here's the big part.</v>

2159
00:59:34.220 --> 00:59:35.860
<v Speaker 2>If it didn't make sense,</v>

2160
00:59:35.890 --> 00:59:37.090
<v Speaker 2>it wouldn't be funny.</v>

2161
00:59:37.360 --> 00:59:37.960
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2162

2170
00:59:48.750 --> 00:59:49.300
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2171

<v Speaker 2>So why are you pretending?</v>

2172

2194
01:00:30.101 --> 01:00:34.180
<v Speaker 2>She's had a thousand people on reddit review this blog and then,</v>

2195
01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:35.170
<v Speaker 2>and then,</v>

2196
01:00:35.170 --> 01:00:36.340
<v Speaker 2>then decide,</v>

2197
01:00:36.360 --> 01:00:37.920
<v Speaker 2>you know how it gets raided.</v>

2198
01:00:38.290 --> 01:00:40.780
<v Speaker 2>We like red stars over the top of it.</v>

2199
01:00:41.050 --> 01:00:41.351
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2200
01:00:41.351 --> 01:00:42.170
<v Speaker 2>And then you,</v>

2201
01:00:42.170 --> 01:00:45.130
<v Speaker 2>then this company decides whether or not they want to fucking print your dumb</v>

2202
01:00:45.131 --> 01:00:45.690
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

2203
01:00:45.690 --> 01:00:46.270
<v Speaker 2>Jesus.</v>

2204
01:00:46.270 --> 01:00:49.780
<v Speaker 2>But she's right about that comedian shouldn't get a free pass.</v>

2205
01:00:50.380 --> 01:00:54.100
<v Speaker 2>They shouldn't like their shit and it's just racist and it's not funny.</v>

2206
01:00:54.130 --> 01:00:54.541
<v Speaker 2>And you,</v>

2207
01:00:54.541 --> 01:00:55.780
<v Speaker 2>you hear it and it's not,</v>

2208
01:00:55.781 --> 01:00:56.050
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2209
01:00:56.050 --> 01:00:56.351
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2210
01:00:56.351 --> 01:00:57.400
<v Speaker 2>someone crossed the line.</v>

2211
01:00:57.850 --> 01:01:00.400
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of times that's an competence.</v>

2212
01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:04.060
<v Speaker 2>A lot of times it's guys who think that they're being edgy,</v>

2213
01:01:04.061 --> 01:01:04.900
<v Speaker 2>so that's funny.</v>

2214
01:01:04.900 --> 01:01:06.170
<v Speaker 2>But they don't really know how to be funny.</v>

2215
01:01:06.171 --> 01:01:09.160
<v Speaker 2>And like we've all worked with guys there are shockingly bad.</v>

2216
01:01:09.340 --> 01:01:10.173
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

2217
01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:10.581
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2218
01:01:10.581 --> 01:01:11.500
<v Speaker 2>and that,</v>

2219
01:01:11.950 --> 01:01:12.930
<v Speaker 2>that sort of calm.</v>

2220
01:01:13.030 --> 01:01:16.600
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes people say things and they just say things because they're stuck on</v>

2221
01:01:16.601 --> 01:01:17.980
<v Speaker 2>stage and they start talking.</v>

2222
01:01:17.981 --> 01:01:19.060
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even know what the fuck they're saying,</v>

2223
01:01:19.180 --> 01:01:20.530
<v Speaker 2>but they're trying to be edgy.</v>

2224
01:01:20.590 --> 01:01:20.770
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2225
01:01:20.770 --> 01:01:23.420
<v Speaker 2>So then they say something like really fucked up and race.</v>

2226
01:01:24.040 --> 01:01:24.890
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever seen that happen?</v>

2227
01:01:25.550 --> 01:01:25.911
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2228

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2230
01:01:26.891 --> 01:01:28.720
<v Speaker 2>though that feeling when you're panicking.</v>

2231
01:01:29.260 --> 01:01:30.760
<v Speaker 2>But this obviously this is,</v>

2232
01:01:30.761 --> 01:01:32.680
<v Speaker 2>she's talking about a monologue,</v>

2233
01:01:33.010 --> 01:01:34.120
<v Speaker 4>but I've seen it with,</v>

2241
01:01:48.450 --> 01:01:48.611
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2242
01:01:48.611 --> 01:01:49.660

2292
01:03:10.831 --> 01:03:12.780
<v Speaker 2>audience for like 15 minutes.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Just talk things out and that there was nothing.</v>

2299
01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:25.920
<v Speaker 2>It's also so subjective.</v>

2300
01:03:26.070 --> 01:03:28.830
<v Speaker 2>So someone saying a comedian getting a free pass.</v>

<v Speaker 2>it might not be good for you.</v>

2303
01:03:31.530 --> 01:03:32.220
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2304
01:03:32.220 --> 01:03:35.370
<v Speaker 2>But you got to understand that that's that person doing this thing.</v>

2305
01:03:35.670 --> 01:03:37.770
<v Speaker 2>It's like the same as someone singing a song.</v>

2306
01:03:38.130 --> 01:03:39.750
<v Speaker 2>You're just not thinking about it that way.</v>

2307
01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:41.640
<v Speaker 2>You know when someone is singing a song,</v>

2308
01:03:41.641 --> 01:03:43.470
<v Speaker 2>they're creating a piece of instrument entertainment.</v>

2309
01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:44.820
<v Speaker 2>When someone's doing a joke,</v>

2310
01:03:44.821 --> 01:03:46.540
<v Speaker 2>they're creating a piece of entertainment too,</v>

2311
01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:49.680
<v Speaker 2>but it's a completely different process and sometimes it doesn't work.</v>

2312
01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:52.290
<v Speaker 2>It's not like someone said that like you asked them,</v>

2313
01:03:52.470 --> 01:03:53.430
<v Speaker 2>Hey Thomson girl,</v>

2314
01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:55.800
<v Speaker 2>what do you think about white girls with cornrows?</v>

2315
01:03:56.190 --> 01:03:56.761
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

2316
01:03:56.761 --> 01:03:57.660
<v Speaker 2>and you just go,</v>

2317
01:03:57.661 --> 01:03:57.961
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2318
01:03:57.961 --> 01:03:58.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2319
01:03:58.370 --> 01:04:00.240
<v Speaker 2>I fucking think there are a bunch of crazy bitches.</v>

2320
01:04:00.241 --> 01:04:01.020
<v Speaker 2>They'll stab you.</v>

2321
01:04:01.020 --> 01:04:02.880
<v Speaker 2>Like you're not being interviewed for the news.</v>

2322
01:04:02.881 --> 01:04:03.210
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2323
01:04:03.210 --> 01:04:04.290
<v Speaker 2>You're telling jokes,</v>

2324
01:04:04.410 --> 01:04:05.243
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>

2325
01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:07.530
<v Speaker 2>And that that's a real like,</v>

2326
01:04:07.531 --> 01:04:07.801
<v Speaker 2>to me,</v>

2327
01:04:07.801 --> 01:04:12.801
<v Speaker 2>that's a real social problem that people need to be called on because I think</v>

2328
01:04:13.770 --> 01:04:18.690
<v Speaker 2>when people think that they can just get away with being twatty like that and</v>

2329
01:04:18.691 --> 01:04:23.691
<v Speaker 2>everybody gives him that political correct free pass and puts logic out the door</v>

2330
01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:25.410
<v Speaker 2>and doesn't call him on it going,</v>

2331
01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:25.580
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2332
01:04:25.580 --> 01:04:26.730
<v Speaker 2>that's not what's going on here.</v>

2333
01:04:26.731 --> 01:04:27.190
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>

2334
01:04:27.190 --> 01:04:27.340
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2335
01:04:27.340 --> 01:04:29.670
<v Speaker 2>you shut the fuck up if I was in your living room,</v>

2336
01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:30.840
<v Speaker 2>can you imagine if you're in your,</v>

2337
01:04:30.841 --> 01:04:35.841
<v Speaker 2>in your house and you and a fucking Seth macfarlane are sitting there joking</v>

2338
01:04:35.851 --> 01:04:39.810
<v Speaker 2>around and he says that about Salma Hayek and you guys both start laughing.</v>

2339
01:04:39.811 --> 01:04:40.760
<v Speaker 2>He like a couple of,</v>

2340
01:04:41.430 --> 01:04:41.761
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2341
01:04:41.761 --> 01:04:42.870
<v Speaker 2>a couple guys would,</v>

2342
01:04:42.990 --> 01:04:45.690
<v Speaker 2>and then this woman is also there and she's on the couch,</v>

2343
01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:46.740
<v Speaker 2>just the three of you.</v>

2344
01:04:46.830 --> 01:04:47.970
<v Speaker 2>And she starts complaining,</v>

2345
01:04:48.090 --> 01:04:48.750
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

2346
01:04:48.750 --> 01:04:49.171
<v Speaker 2>you'd be like,</v>

2347
01:04:49.171 --> 01:04:49.920
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

2348
01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:50.753
<v Speaker 2>And then and,</v>

2349
01:04:50.780 --> 01:04:52.940
<v Speaker 2>and you would have a crazy,</v>

2350
01:04:53.510 --> 01:04:56.580
<v Speaker 2>a con argument about they're your size and then you'd be like,</v>

2351
01:04:56.581 --> 01:04:58.800
<v Speaker 2>we're never hanging out with that person ever again.</v>

2352
01:04:58.950 --> 01:04:59.281
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2353
01:04:59.281 --> 01:05:04.110
<v Speaker 2>it's the most ironic thing because lefties and progressive people are always</v>

2354
01:05:04.170 --> 01:05:06.300
<v Speaker 2>espousing freedom of speech.</v>

2355
01:05:06.540 --> 01:05:07.680
<v Speaker 2>The First Amendment,</v>

2356
01:05:07.681 --> 01:05:08.431
<v Speaker 2>freedom of the press,</v>

2357
01:05:08.431 --> 01:05:11.700
<v Speaker 2>they're always talking about how important it is to have a free internet.</v>

2358
01:05:12.120 --> 01:05:17.120
<v Speaker 2>But meanwhile they're also like the first people willing to get at someone</v>

2359
01:05:17.911 --> 01:05:22.590
<v Speaker 2>expressing themselves in a manner that they find amusing or that they find,</v>

2360
01:05:22.620 --> 01:05:23.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2361
01:05:23.280 --> 01:05:25.140
<v Speaker 2>they find shocking but funny.</v>

2362
01:05:25.230 --> 01:05:27.300
<v Speaker 2>You should have free speech up until it bothers me.</v>

2363
01:05:27.301 --> 01:05:27.751
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

2364
01:05:27.751 --> 01:05:28.584
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

2365
01:05:28.590 --> 01:05:31.050
<v Speaker 2>Free speech up until you cross the conservative line.</v>

2366
01:05:31.380 --> 01:05:34.380
<v Speaker 2>And then when I feel like you've crossed into some area where I can make fun of</v>

2367
01:05:34.381 --> 01:05:34.720
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

2368
01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:35.261
<v Speaker 4>Do you ever get,</v>

2369
01:05:35.261 --> 01:05:35.770
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2370
01:05:35.770 --> 01:05:38.680
<v Speaker 4>have you gotten mail hate mail about jokes?</v>

2371
01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:39.220
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2372
01:05:39.220 --> 01:05:39.910
<v Speaker 4>not really.</v>

2373
01:05:39.910 --> 01:05:40.151
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2374
01:05:40.151 --> 01:05:40.781
<v Speaker 4>I mean sure.</v>

2375
01:05:40.781 --> 01:05:42.750
<v Speaker 4>There's been certain things that people have been upset about it.</v>

2376
01:05:42.751 --> 01:05:43.210
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2377
01:05:43.210 --> 01:05:45.100
<v Speaker 4>I always feel like going like,</v>

2378
01:05:45.540 --> 01:05:47.020
<v Speaker 4>like do you remember this thing that you're up,</v>

2379
01:05:47.080 --> 01:05:52.080
<v Speaker 4>this was on a standup comedy show or this was a comedy?</v>

2380
01:05:52.340 --> 01:05:54.860
<v Speaker 2>Well you had a lot of people mad at you about that bike joke.</v>

2381
01:05:54.861 --> 01:05:55.280
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2382
01:05:55.280 --> 01:05:56.120
<v Speaker 2>So many.</v>

2383
01:05:58.100 --> 01:06:01.160
<v Speaker 5>You looked like a little like bothered by it at one point in time.</v>

2384
01:06:01.161 --> 01:06:03.440
<v Speaker 5>Like I didn't know what to kill you.</v>

2385
01:06:03.480 --> 01:06:05.280
<v Speaker 5>What weather?</v>

2386
01:06:05.720 --> 01:06:09.650
<v Speaker 5>Like it was a normal reaction like cause it was the first thing that had gotten</v>

2387
01:06:09.651 --> 01:06:11.750
<v Speaker 5>any like real exposure</v>

2388
01:06:14.220 --> 01:06:15.830
<v Speaker 5>and everybody wants to kill you.</v>

2389
01:06:16.340 --> 01:06:18.530
<v Speaker 4>The big thing that it got was it got the um,</v>

2390
01:06:20.180 --> 01:06:24.560
<v Speaker 4>he got the Huffington post home comedy page for a day.</v>

2391
01:06:24.890 --> 01:06:29.180
<v Speaker 4>So like it was the first thing on huffpost comedy because it was using,</v>

2392

01:07:46.530 --> 01:07:46.810
<v Speaker 4>never.</v>

2445
01:07:46.810 --> 01:07:47.440
<v Speaker 4>Never got drunk.</v>

2446
01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:47.671
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2447
01:07:47.671 --> 01:07:47.851
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2448
01:07:47.851 --> 01:07:48.140
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

2449
01:07:48.140 --> 01:07:48.420
<v Speaker 4>I've,</v>

2450
01:07:48.420 --> 01:07:48.931
<v Speaker 4>I've been,</v>

2451
01:07:48.931 --> 01:07:49.764
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2452
01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:50.971
<v Speaker 4>I've really,</v>

2453
01:07:50.971 --> 01:07:55.971
<v Speaker 4>the most I've ever had is like a buzz from drinking where I recognized that it</v>

2454
01:07:56.341 --> 01:08:00.050
<v Speaker 4>was throwing off my timing and stuff like and then um,</v>

2455
01:08:00.330 --> 01:08:01.410
<v Speaker 4>I just couldn't think as quick.</v>

2456
01:08:01.440 --> 01:08:02.130
<v Speaker 4>That's not good.</v>

2457
01:08:02.130 --> 01:08:03.450
<v Speaker 4>So I I I personally,</v>

2458
01:08:03.480 --> 01:08:04.170
<v Speaker 4>I mean I know it,</v>

2459
01:08:04.170 --> 01:08:05.040
<v Speaker 4>everyone's different with it.</v>

2460
01:08:05.250 --> 01:08:09.630
<v Speaker 4>I don't drink until I'm done performing cause I will fuck me up sometimes.</v>

2461
01:08:09.631 --> 01:08:10.020
<v Speaker 4>I do.</v>

2462
01:08:10.020 --> 01:08:12.000
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes I have a couple of drinks and you pull it off.</v>

2463
01:08:12.120 --> 01:08:12.271
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2464
01:08:12.271 --> 01:08:12.671
<v Speaker 2>But I,</v>

2465
01:08:12.671 --> 01:08:15.240
<v Speaker 2>I prefer honestly I prefer my sets,</v>

2466
01:08:15.300 --> 01:08:15.710
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2467
01:08:15.710 --> 01:08:17.720
<v Speaker 2>when I'm just a little bit high</v>

2468
01:08:19.400 --> 01:08:20.233
<v Speaker 2>or sober.</v>

2469
01:08:20.570 --> 01:08:21.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2470
01:08:21.020 --> 01:08:21.920
<v Speaker 2>Those are my best sets.</v>

2471
01:08:21.980 --> 01:08:22.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2472
01:08:22.250 --> 01:08:23.083
<v Speaker 2>me too.</v>

2473
01:08:23.330 --> 01:08:26.240
<v Speaker 2>But every now and then I'll go up lit and crush.</v>

2474
01:08:26.510 --> 01:08:27.950
<v Speaker 2>Especially like at the Ice House,</v>

2475
01:08:27.951 --> 01:08:28.970
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>

2476
01:08:28.971 --> 01:08:30.990
<v Speaker 2>Cause it's like home base.</v>

2477
01:08:31.370 --> 01:08:34.610
<v Speaker 2>I'll get a couple of Jack Daniels and go up to the ice house because the ice</v>

2478
01:08:34.611 --> 01:08:36.740
<v Speaker 2>house is like so positive.</v>

2479
01:08:36.770 --> 01:08:37.100
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>

2480
01:08:37.100 --> 01:08:38.000
<v Speaker 2>Like everyone,</v>

2481
01:08:38.001 --> 01:08:39.200
<v Speaker 2>there is all hugs.</v>

2482
01:08:39.201 --> 01:08:40.700
<v Speaker 2>The waiters are cool,</v>

2483
01:08:40.701 --> 01:08:42.200
<v Speaker 2>the bartenders are cool,</v>

2484
01:08:42.201 --> 01:08:43.640
<v Speaker 2>the waitresses are cool,</v>

2485
01:08:43.641 --> 01:08:44.960
<v Speaker 2>the managers are cool.</v>

2486
01:08:45.260 --> 01:08:46.670
<v Speaker 2>It's like when you go to the ice house,</v>

2487
01:08:46.671 --> 01:08:47.001
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

2488
01:08:47.001 --> 01:08:47.960
<v Speaker 2>that's like a love.</v>

2489
01:08:47.961 --> 01:08:49.530
<v Speaker 2>That's like set a family environment.</v>

2490
01:08:49.630 --> 01:08:50.900
<v Speaker 2>When we do as Wednesday nights there,</v>

2491
01:08:51.050 --> 01:08:52.250
<v Speaker 2>we'll probably do one next week too.</v>

2492
01:08:52.251 --> 01:08:52.581
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>

2493
01:08:52.581 --> 01:08:53.414
<v Speaker 2>folks.</v>

2494
01:08:53.510 --> 01:08:56.840
<v Speaker 2>We do those Wednesday nights and it's packed on a Wednesday night at 10.</v>

2495
01:08:56.841 --> 01:08:58.100
<v Speaker 2>It's like you could do anything there.</v>

<v Speaker 2>What time is your show?</v>

2507
01:09:15.951 --> 01:09:17.420
<v Speaker 2>That's at 10 o'clock ice house,</v>

2508
01:09:17.421 --> 01:09:19.000
<v Speaker 2>comedy.com desk squad show.</v>

2509
01:09:19.090 --> 01:09:21.830
<v Speaker 2>We have a very odd podcast on,</v>

2510
01:09:21.831 --> 01:09:22.400
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2511
01:09:22.400 --> 01:09:22.820
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>

2512
01:09:22.820 --> 01:09:23.653
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2513
01:09:24.830 --> 01:09:27.800
<v Speaker 2>on Friday with a doctor Amit Goswami.</v>

2514
01:09:28.250 --> 01:09:29.630
<v Speaker 2>It's a theoretical physicist.</v>

2515
01:09:30.230 --> 01:09:30.680
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2516
01:09:30.680 --> 01:09:31.550
<v Speaker 2>Particle physicists.</v>

2517
01:09:31.551 --> 01:09:32.360
<v Speaker 2>Guys,</v>

2518
01:09:32.360 --> 01:09:33.193
<v Speaker 2>what's he going to talk about?</v>

2519
01:09:33.860 --> 01:09:34.760
<v Speaker 2>Theoretical physicists,</v>

2520
01:09:35.290 --> 01:09:38.850
<v Speaker 2>like they write a book or like is it's going to talk about the nature of matter.</v>

2521
01:09:38.851 --> 01:09:40.100
<v Speaker 2>He's going to talk about string theory.</v>

2522
01:09:40.130 --> 01:09:44.030
<v Speaker 2>He's going to talk about how the fucking world is really constructed inside of</v>

2523
01:09:44.031 --> 01:09:44.661
<v Speaker 2>every atom.</v>

2524
01:09:44.661 --> 01:09:46.370
<v Speaker 2>It's just empty space.</v>

2525
01:09:46.790 --> 01:09:47.690
<v Speaker 2>How this,</v>

2526
01:09:47.840 --> 01:09:52.840
<v Speaker 2>this idea of strings vibrating that control and,</v>

2527
01:09:53.061 --> 01:09:54.260
<v Speaker 2>and create all matter.</v>

2528
01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:57.680
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be a total mind fuck because he's like super legit.</v>

2529
01:09:58.170 --> 01:09:58.371
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

2530
01:09:58.371 --> 01:09:58.731
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2531
01:09:58.731 --> 01:10:01.850
<v Speaker 2>he's like legit as those quantum scientists go,</v>

2532
01:10:01.851 --> 01:10:03.920
<v Speaker 2>those quantum guys are so strange.</v>

2533
01:10:04.370 --> 01:10:08.180
<v Speaker 2>It's so hard to understand because everything they're doing like is,</v>

2534
01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:10.670
<v Speaker 2>is all this alien mathematical language.</v>

2535
01:10:10.671 --> 01:10:12.380
<v Speaker 2>Like you see them writing it out and in,</v>

2536
01:10:12.381 --> 01:10:16.340
<v Speaker 2>in that alien mathematical language as they're writing down all those fucking</v>

2537
01:10:16.341 --> 01:10:18.350
<v Speaker 2>symbols and how that Einstein,</v>

2538
01:10:18.351 --> 01:10:18.910
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2539
01:10:18.910 --> 01:10:19.490
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2540
01:10:19.490 --> 01:10:20.323
<v Speaker 2>fucking,</v>

2541
01:10:21.140 --> 01:10:23.150
<v Speaker 2>what's that movie with Matt Damon and uh,</v>

2542
01:10:23.210 --> 01:10:24.043
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

2543
01:10:24.490 --> 01:10:25.340
<v Speaker 2>What was that movie?</v>

2544
01:10:28.820 --> 01:10:29.653
<v Speaker 2>A bunch of numbers.</v>

2545
01:10:30.290 --> 01:10:30.810
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2546
01:10:30.810 --> 01:10:31.401
<v Speaker 2>goodwill hunting.</v>

2547
01:10:31.401 --> 01:10:31.971
<v Speaker 2>Good will hunting.</v>

2548
01:10:31.971 --> 01:10:32.211
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2549
01:10:32.211 --> 01:10:34.820
<v Speaker 2>When he's writing all that stuff on the board and you don't know if it's right,</v>

2550
01:10:34.850 --> 01:10:35.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2551
01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:38.420
<v Speaker 2>you don't know if that shit's fucking no idea what all that is.</v>

2552
01:10:38.421 --> 01:10:42.410
<v Speaker 2>He might as well be right in nature and hieroglyphs shit for mathematics.</v>

2553
01:10:42.411 --> 01:10:43.500
<v Speaker 2>It's complex my flags.</v>

2554
01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:44.930
<v Speaker 2>But when he's writing that,</v>

2555
01:10:44.950 --> 01:10:45.171
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2556
01:10:45.171 --> 01:10:46.370
<v Speaker 2>these guys are writing that shit.</v>

2557
01:10:46.371 --> 01:10:47.920
<v Speaker 2>Like I've seen them like on notes,</v>

2558
01:10:47.930 --> 01:10:50.870
<v Speaker 2>like they'll have an inspiration for the way and equation.</v>

2559
01:10:50.871 --> 01:10:53.020
<v Speaker 2>It's supposed to be interacting with the environment and like</v>

2560
01:10:54.590 --> 01:10:55.060
<v Speaker 2>my brain,</v>

2561
01:10:55.060 --> 01:10:59.390
<v Speaker 2>just like the real problem with didn't dealing with those guys.</v>

2562
01:10:59.630 --> 01:11:00.480
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're,</v>

2563
01:11:00.740 --> 01:11:01.480
<v Speaker 2>even when you're,</v>

2564
01:11:01.480 --> 01:11:04.130
<v Speaker 2>you're asking questions about how they came to the conclusions,</v>

2565
01:11:04.131 --> 01:11:07.580
<v Speaker 2>like how they understand these things and where were the ideas of string theory</v>

2566
01:11:07.581 --> 01:11:08.151
<v Speaker 2>come from?</v>

2567
01:11:08.151 --> 01:11:10.010
<v Speaker 2>It's like you can't even measure it.</v>

2568
01:11:10.011 --> 01:11:10.380
<v Speaker 2>Like they,</v>

2569
01:11:10.380 --> 01:11:10.971
<v Speaker 2>they're just,</v>

2570
01:11:10.971 --> 01:11:15.480
<v Speaker 2>they're talking about something that they say and like number form and it'll</v>

2571
01:11:15.490 --> 01:11:17.320
<v Speaker 2>show you like pate but you'll never get it.</v>

2572
01:11:17.410 --> 01:11:17.710
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2573
01:11:17.710 --> 01:11:18.340
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be like,</v>

2574
01:11:18.340 --> 01:11:18.641
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2575
01:11:18.641 --> 01:11:19.121
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

2576
01:11:19.121 --> 01:11:20.050
<v Speaker 2>Like you'll try it again.</v>

2577
01:11:20.560 --> 01:11:24.920
<v Speaker 2>They spray pixie dust and then say Alica Zam and</v>

2578
01:11:25.030 --> 01:11:25.900
<v Speaker 3>babies are born.</v>

2579
01:11:25.930 --> 01:11:28.930
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty sure I wouldn't get it because I don't get Algebra one.</v>

2580
01:11:30.070 --> 01:11:33.580
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I would get the advanced shit with it that I don't even,</v>

2581
01:11:33.610 --> 01:11:37.090
<v Speaker 3>I can't understand the beginning of what they're trying to even explain.</v>

2582
01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:42.150
<v Speaker 3>I think some people just don't have the capacity or the ability,</v>

2583
01:11:42.280 --> 01:11:43.000
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2584
01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:44.410
<v Speaker 2>I think it's like almost anything.</v>

2585
01:11:44.411 --> 01:11:46.570
<v Speaker 2>If you have an interest in it and you pursue it,</v>

2586
01:11:46.610 --> 01:11:46.840
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2587
01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:47.673
<v Speaker 2>you're good at it.</v>

2588
01:11:47.830 --> 01:11:52.830
<v Speaker 2>And I think mathematics is probably real similar to whether it's literature or</v>

2589
01:11:53.260 --> 01:11:54.490
<v Speaker 2>even athletics is like,</v>

2590
01:11:54.640 --> 01:11:55.930
<v Speaker 2>what do you focus your energy on?</v>

2591
01:11:55.931 --> 01:11:57.310
<v Speaker 2>You focus your energy on this.</v>

2592
01:11:57.640 --> 01:11:58.930
<v Speaker 2>You're going to figure out how to do it.</v>

2593
01:11:58.960 --> 01:11:59.351
<v Speaker 2>If it's,</v>

2594
01:11:59.351 --> 01:12:01.150
<v Speaker 2>if it's interesting to you and you,</v>

2595
01:12:01.151 --> 01:12:02.920
<v Speaker 2>I mean you might not be the best in the world at it,</v>

2596
01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:04.780
<v Speaker 2>but if you put your focus on it,</v>

2597
01:12:04.960 --> 01:12:06.820
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be able to figure out how to do it.</v>

2598
01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:07.420
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>

2599
01:12:07.420 --> 01:12:08.253
<v Speaker 2>Almost anything,</v>

2600
01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:08.891
<v Speaker 2>almost anything.</v>

2601
01:12:08.891 --> 01:12:10.780
<v Speaker 2>But it's like what entices you?</v>

2602
01:12:10.900 --> 01:12:11.431
<v Speaker 2>Does it do you?</v>

2603
01:12:11.431 --> 01:12:11.610
<v Speaker 2>Are you,</v>

2604
01:12:11.610 --> 01:12:12.160
<v Speaker 2>are you like,</v>

2605
01:12:12.160 --> 01:12:12.461
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>

2606
01:12:12.461 --> 01:12:13.210
<v Speaker 2>math,</v>

2607
01:12:13.210 --> 01:12:14.043
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>

2608
01:12:14.050 --> 01:12:14.321
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2609
01:12:14.321 --> 01:12:15.400
<v Speaker 2>you're not with you.</v>

2610
01:12:15.401 --> 01:12:15.700
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

2611
01:12:15.700 --> 01:12:15.971
<v Speaker 2>aw,</v>

2612
01:12:15.971 --> 01:12:17.470
<v Speaker 2>stage time when we could do a joke.</v>

2613
01:12:17.590 --> 01:12:17.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2614
01:12:17.950 --> 01:12:18.783
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to kill.</v>

2615
01:12:19.540 --> 01:12:20.450
<v Speaker 2>That's like that's,</v>

2616
01:12:20.490 --> 01:12:21.870
<v Speaker 2>that's what entices you.</v>

2617
01:12:22.420 --> 01:12:24.340
<v Speaker 2>What's attractive to you is what you pursue.</v>

2618
01:12:24.620 --> 01:12:27.700
<v Speaker 2>What's attracted to you or attractive to you stand up comedy.</v>

2619
01:12:27.850 --> 01:12:31.450
<v Speaker 2>But if you were one of those wacky dudes like that Russian guy who solved this</v>

2620
01:12:31.451 --> 01:12:31.901
<v Speaker 2>prize,</v>

2621
01:12:31.901 --> 01:12:33.580
<v Speaker 2>that we're going to give them $1 million prize.</v>

2622
01:12:33.940 --> 01:12:35.500
<v Speaker 2>The guy who said he didn't even want the money.</v>

2623
01:12:35.890 --> 01:12:37.510
<v Speaker 2>He's so fucking crazy.</v>

2624
01:12:37.900 --> 01:12:39.850
<v Speaker 2>This dude is just up there in Siberia,</v>

2625
01:12:39.940 --> 01:12:44.290
<v Speaker 2>right and shit down on paper and he solves some crazy mathematical equation that</v>

2626
01:12:44.291 --> 01:12:45.124
<v Speaker 2>they had been trying to,</v>

2627
01:12:45.190 --> 01:12:47.500
<v Speaker 2>I should pull up the actual information so I don't,</v>

2628
01:12:47.560 --> 01:12:49.360
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't sound like I'm talking out of my ass,</v>

2629
01:12:49.750 --> 01:12:50.470
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>

2630
01:12:50.470 --> 01:12:50.920
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

2631
01:12:50.920 --> 01:12:52.290
<v Speaker 2>he Russian,</v>

2632
01:12:52.360 --> 01:12:53.020
<v Speaker 2>let me pull this up.</v>

2633
01:12:53.020 --> 01:12:53.650
<v Speaker 2>Russian song.</v>

2634
01:12:53.650 --> 01:12:56.500
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to just Google Russian scientists.</v>

2635
01:12:56.710 --> 01:12:59.470
<v Speaker 2>Come dog wins math prize.</v>

2636
01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:03.100
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't want it.</v>

2637
01:13:05.890 --> 01:13:06.760
<v Speaker 2>Let's see if that works.</v>

2638
01:13:07.350 --> 01:13:09.520
<v Speaker 2>And notice that I didn't use bing.</v>

2639
01:13:10.570 --> 01:13:12.190
<v Speaker 2>I used fucking Google.</v>

2640
01:13:12.220 --> 01:13:12.850
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2641

<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2643
01:13:14.100 --> 01:13:15.150
<v Speaker 3>You should try bing.</v>

2644
01:13:15.510 --> 01:13:20.380
<v Speaker 3>Bing is actually better than Google surprise being so crazy.</v>

2645
01:13:20.710 --> 01:13:23.760
<v Speaker 3>I like when a search engine is a good God damn time.</v>

2646
01:13:23.980 --> 01:13:24.430
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2647
01:13:24.430 --> 01:13:25.320
<v Speaker 3>I tell you one thing though,</v>

2648
01:13:25.321 --> 01:13:25.930
<v Speaker 3>if you Google,</v>

2649
01:13:25.930 --> 01:13:28.140
<v Speaker 3>we had this thing on muffs said the other day.</v>

2650

01:13:33.750 --> 01:13:35.070
<v Speaker 3>You don't get any tits.</v>

2655
01:13:35.220 --> 01:13:37.560
<v Speaker 3>But if you go to Yahoo and do boobs,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2660
01:13:41.620 --> 01:13:42.800
<v Speaker 3>Google's trying to hide the heads.</v>

01:13:43.330 --> 01:13:43.680
<v Speaker 3>Sorry.</v>

2662

01:13:44.340 --> 01:13:45.270
<v Speaker 3>Try and make that paper.</v>

2664
01:13:46.290 --> 01:13:47.130
<v Speaker 3>This is the dude.</v>

2665

<v Speaker 3>he's a</v>

2669
01:13:49.040 --> 01:13:51.080
<v Speaker 2>Russian scientists from Saint Petersburg.</v>

2670
01:13:51.081 --> 01:13:53.570
<v Speaker 2>His name is Gregory Bill Man.</v>

2671
01:13:54.230 --> 01:13:59.230
<v Speaker 2>He's a 40 year old man and he won the fields medal often described as mass</v>

2672
01:13:59.331 --> 01:14:03.110
<v Speaker 2>equivalent to the Nobel prize for a breakthrough in the study of shapes that</v>

2673
01:14:03.111 --> 01:14:08.111
<v Speaker 2>experts say might help scientists figure out the shape of the universe and super</v>

2674
01:14:08.541 --> 01:14:09.920
<v Speaker 2>offended by the way you said his name,</v>

2675
01:14:09.921 --> 01:14:14.600
<v Speaker 2>with that accurate Gregory bureau men to really offensive.</v>

2676

<v Speaker 2>John [inaudible],</v>

2677
01:14:15.150 --> 01:14:18.620
<v Speaker 2>president of the International Mathematics Union said that he had urged Perlman</v>

2678
01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:19.730
<v Speaker 2>per p,</v>

2679
01:14:19.730 --> 01:14:20.000
<v Speaker 2>p.</v>

2680

<v Speaker 2>A.</v>

2687
01:14:23.360 --> 01:14:23.450
<v Speaker 2>N.</v>

2688
01:14:23.450 --> 01:14:24.320
<v Speaker 2>So I don't know what that is.</v>

2689
01:14:24.370 --> 01:14:24.790
<v Speaker 2>Oh Man.</v>

2690
01:14:24.790 --> 01:14:27.100
<v Speaker 2>Pirlo Pearlman Pearlman.</v>

2691
01:14:27.860 --> 01:14:28.400
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

2692
01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:29.233
<v Speaker 2>homeboy,</v>

2693
01:14:29.570 --> 01:14:31.700
<v Speaker 2>he urged homeboy to accept the metal,</v>

2694
01:14:31.850 --> 01:14:35.810
<v Speaker 2>but he said he felt isolated from the mathematics community and does not want to</v>

2695
01:14:35.811 --> 01:14:37.250
<v Speaker 2>be seen as a figurehead.</v>

2696
01:14:37.880 --> 01:14:38.690
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2697
01:14:38.690 --> 01:14:39.890
<v Speaker 2>He just didn't want the money.</v>

2698
01:14:39.891 --> 01:14:41.990
<v Speaker 2>He passed on $1 million money.</v>

2699
01:14:42.230 --> 01:14:43.280
<v Speaker 2>A million dollar prize.</v>

2700
01:14:43.340 --> 01:14:44.310
<v Speaker 2>Million Dollars.</v>

2701
01:14:44.390 --> 01:14:45.223
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

2702
01:14:45.230 --> 01:14:49.280
<v Speaker 2>Besides shunning the award for his work in top topology.</v>

2703
01:14:49.490 --> 01:14:53.990
<v Speaker 2>He also seems uninteresting according to colleagues in a separate wouldn't</v>

2704
01:14:53.991 --> 01:14:54.980
<v Speaker 2>billion dollar prize.</v>

2705
01:14:54.981 --> 01:14:55.814
<v Speaker 2>He could win.</v>

2706
01:14:56.420 --> 01:15:01.420
<v Speaker 2>Providing the Poincare conjecture a theorem about the nature of multidimensional</v>

2707
01:15:01.761 --> 01:15:02.594
<v Speaker 2>space.</v>

2708
01:15:02.900 --> 01:15:03.733
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

2709

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2712
01:15:06.891 --> 01:15:07.690
<v Speaker 2>he's too smart.</v>

2713
01:15:07.690 --> 01:15:08.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2714
01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:12.800
<v Speaker 2>That's a dude that's too smart and doesn't understand what $2 billion can get</v>

2715
01:15:12.801 --> 01:15:13.180
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

2716
01:15:13.180 --> 01:15:15.200
<v Speaker 2>Cause he can get you a lot of cool shit.</v>

2717
01:15:15.260 --> 01:15:16.093
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2718
01:15:16.530 --> 01:15:16.670
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2719
01:15:16.670 --> 01:15:17.750
<v Speaker 5>you're going to have to do,</v>

2720
01:15:17.810 --> 01:15:20.790
<v Speaker 5>one of the things you could do is move from Siberia with your million dollars.</v>

2721
01:15:21.140 --> 01:15:21.411
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2722
01:15:21.411 --> 01:15:23.000
<v Speaker 5>You gotta be a really crazy</v>

2723
01:15:23.090 --> 01:15:24.940
<v Speaker 2>fuck to pass on 1 million bucks pocket.</v>

2724
01:15:24.980 --> 01:15:28.760
<v Speaker 2>But you probably also have to be a really crazy fuck to be able to think in such</v>

2725
01:15:28.761 --> 01:15:29.930
<v Speaker 2>a spectacular way.</v>

2726
01:15:30.550 --> 01:15:32.030
<v Speaker 2>It's like the fact that this guy,</v>

2727
01:15:32.450 --> 01:15:37.450
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's not that this guy wasn't successful because he's studied mathematics</v>

2728
01:15:38.931 --> 01:15:39.411
<v Speaker 2>only.</v>

2729
01:15:39.411 --> 01:15:41.150
<v Speaker 2>He put all his focus on mathematics.</v>

2730
01:15:41.480 --> 01:15:44.150
<v Speaker 2>But once he got really good at that,</v>

2731
01:15:44.151 --> 01:15:47.030
<v Speaker 2>well then he was able to capitalize on is excellence.</v>

2732
01:15:47.430 --> 01:15:47.850
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2733
01:15:47.850 --> 01:15:48.171
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2734
01:15:48.171 --> 01:15:48.321
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2735
01:15:48.321 --> 01:15:49.760
<v Speaker 2>they offered him money and he said,</v>

2736
01:15:49.790 --> 01:15:53.050
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to go back to the shock.</v>

2737
01:15:53.420 --> 01:15:55.460
<v Speaker 2>And the things like [inaudible] papers.</v>

2738
01:15:55.520 --> 01:15:59.540
<v Speaker 2>I just realized too that I was talking about people's intelligence earlier in</v>

2739
01:15:59.541 --> 01:16:02.240
<v Speaker 2>this podcast and that if that guy met me,</v>

2740
01:16:02.241 --> 01:16:02.721
<v Speaker 2>he'd be like,</v>

2741
01:16:02.721 --> 01:16:03.471
<v Speaker 2>are you the dumbest?</v>

2742
01:16:03.471 --> 01:16:03.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2743
01:16:03.590 --> 01:16:04.423
<v Speaker 5>Personally,</v>

2744
01:16:07.460 --> 01:16:12.390
<v Speaker 5>I've never spoken to somebody as stupid as you told me again.</v>

2745
01:16:12.990 --> 01:16:13.261
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2746
01:16:13.261 --> 01:16:14.940
<v Speaker 5>I wonder what he would be like socially.</v>

2747
01:16:15.030 --> 01:16:16.560
<v Speaker 5>I wonder what's probably a little awkward.</v>

2748
01:16:16.790 --> 01:16:17.623
<v Speaker 5>I guess</v>

2749
01:16:18.890 --> 01:16:19.723
<v Speaker 5>maybe</v>

2750
01:16:22.410 --> 01:16:26.760
<v Speaker 5>they figured out sociology and he figured out the interaction between human</v>

2751
01:16:26.761 --> 01:16:27.270
<v Speaker 5>beings.</v>

2752
01:16:27.270 --> 01:16:29.790
<v Speaker 5>Then he becomes the coolest fucking guy in the world.</v>

2753
01:16:29.791 --> 01:16:30.624
<v Speaker 5>If he's that guy,</v>

2754
01:16:30.690 --> 01:16:31.051
<v Speaker 5>that guy,</v>

2755
01:16:31.051 --> 01:16:34.380
<v Speaker 5>he takes the two months and we all know that that guy,</v>

2756
01:16:34.381 --> 01:16:36.660
<v Speaker 5>that guy takes the 2 million definitely goes pimping.</v>

2757
01:16:36.690 --> 01:16:37.920
<v Speaker 5>You should double up on that shit.</v>

2758
01:16:38.520 --> 01:16:38.851
<v Speaker 5>You know what?</v>

2759
01:16:38.851 --> 01:16:41.880
<v Speaker 5>Someone just called somebody that I thought it was an awesome fucking expression</v>

2760
01:16:41.881 --> 01:16:42.780
<v Speaker 5>to call him a suitcase.</v>

2761
01:16:42.781 --> 01:16:43.320
<v Speaker 5>Pimp.</v>

2762

<v Speaker 5>Suitcase pimps.</v>

2763
01:16:44.930 --> 01:16:45.601
<v Speaker 5>I've never heard of that.</v>

2764
01:16:45.601 --> 01:16:46.200
<v Speaker 5>I like that.</v>

2765
01:16:46.200 --> 01:16:47.610
<v Speaker 5>I have heard it many times,</v>

2766
01:16:47.611 --> 01:16:49.030
<v Speaker 5>but I hadn't heard it a while.</v>

2767
01:16:49.070 --> 01:16:50.070
<v Speaker 5>A suitcase pimp.</v>

2768
01:16:50.420 --> 01:16:50.761

01:16:55.051 --> 01:16:55.820

01:16:55.820 --> 01:16:56.690
<v Speaker 2>positive term.</v>

2775

01:26:03.030 --> 01:26:04.130
<v Speaker 5>there's no need for that music.</v>

3143
01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:06.050
<v Speaker 2>He's got better shit.</v>

3144
01:26:06.080 --> 01:26:06.681
<v Speaker 2>He's got another,</v>

3147
01:26:09.890 --> 01:26:10.320
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3148
01:26:10.320 --> 01:26:10.730
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3149
01:26:10.730 --> 01:26:11.390

01:26:11.390 --> 01:26:12.230
<v Speaker 2>You should get it in another,</v>

3151
01:26:12.470 --> 01:26:13.250
<v Speaker 2>that's the sample.</v>

3152
01:26:13.250 --> 01:26:14.570
<v Speaker 2>But the fact that he's capable of that,</v>

3153
01:26:15.570 --> 01:26:16.490
<v Speaker 2>he's mad hood man.</v>

3154
01:26:16.491 --> 01:26:17.570
<v Speaker 2>He's got to make it for the streets.</v>

3155
01:26:17.571 --> 01:26:18.111
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>

3156
01:26:18.111 --> 01:26:18.621
<v Speaker 2>Bad Hood.</v>

<v Speaker 2>That sounds like some shit you would hear Bubba and ATL if you were bowling on,</v>

3160
01:26:24.471 --> 01:26:29.120
<v Speaker 2>it sounds like you'd locked him in a garage with a hundred cars running and made</v>

3161
01:26:29.121 --> 01:26:31.220
<v Speaker 2>a breathe the fumes for a year.</v>

3162
01:26:31.910 --> 01:26:32.630

<v Speaker 2>It's like it's tough.</v>

3422
01:32:52.870 --> 01:32:53.710
<v Speaker 2>It's tough to,</v>

3423
01:32:54.780 --> 01:32:55.091
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3424
01:32:55.091 --> 01:32:56.620
<v Speaker 2>rationally look at it and say,</v>

3425
01:32:56.621 --> 01:32:59.170
<v Speaker 2>you think it's okay to kill an animal just for it's for,</v>

3426
01:32:59.290 --> 01:33:00.130
<v Speaker 2>I say no.</v>

3427
01:33:00.190 --> 01:33:00.791
<v Speaker 2>I say no.</v>

3428
01:33:00.791 --> 01:33:04.210
<v Speaker 2>I say the only way you should kill an animal is if you're going to use the whole</v>

3429
01:33:04.211 --> 01:33:04.630
<v Speaker 2>animal.</v>

3430
01:33:04.630 --> 01:33:04.920
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

3431
01:33:04.920 --> 01:33:05.753
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

3432
01:33:05.920 --> 01:33:06.671
<v Speaker 2>he did for sure.</v>

3433
01:33:06.671 --> 01:33:08.230
<v Speaker 2>I mean that I think is the most important.</v>

3434
01:33:08.231 --> 01:33:09.910
<v Speaker 2>And if you use the other parts of it as well.</v>

3435
01:33:09.911 --> 01:33:10.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3436
01:33:10.690 --> 01:33:12.130
<v Speaker 2>but just the for man,</v>

3437
01:33:12.131 --> 01:33:13.180
<v Speaker 2>that seems fucked up.</v>

3438
01:33:13.750 --> 01:33:14.400
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>

3439
01:33:14.400 --> 01:33:14.621
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

3440
01:33:14.621 --> 01:33:19.330
<v Speaker 2>And then what's even worse or on the same line is when they kill the fucking</v>

3441
01:33:19.360 --> 01:33:20.650
<v Speaker 2>elephants for the tusks,</v>

3442
01:33:21.400 --> 01:33:22.233
<v Speaker 2>it's dark.</v>

3443
01:33:22.720 --> 01:33:23.410
<v Speaker 2>It's dark.</v>

3444
01:33:23.410 --> 01:33:27.560
<v Speaker 2>There's a big controversy about that with a pool players because uh,</v>

3445
01:33:27.820 --> 01:33:31.270
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of parts of pool cues that they use ivory for.</v>

3446
01:33:31.450 --> 01:33:32.283
<v Speaker 2>Oh really?</v>

3447
01:33:32.560 --> 01:33:32.861
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3448
01:33:32.861 --> 01:33:35.500
<v Speaker 2>but it has to be pre ban ivory and they,</v>

3449
01:33:35.501 --> 01:33:40.060
<v Speaker 2>they're really good at like monitoring where the ivory comes from.</v>

3450
01:33:40.061 --> 01:33:43.270
<v Speaker 2>And occasionally people get arrested for selling illegal ivory.</v>

3451
01:33:43.271 --> 01:33:44.104
<v Speaker 2>Like there was a guy,</v>

3452
01:33:44.250 --> 01:33:45.083
<v Speaker 2>there was a god,</v>

3453
01:33:45.460 --> 01:33:48.490
<v Speaker 2>he distributed stuff for pool,</v>

3454
01:33:48.491 --> 01:33:53.110
<v Speaker 2>a cute makers like a ivory and exotic woods and stuff along those lines.</v>

3455
01:33:53.111 --> 01:33:56.560
<v Speaker 2>And he got arrested a few years back because he,</v>

3456
01:33:56.561 --> 01:33:56.800
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3457
01:33:56.800 --> 01:33:58.930
<v Speaker 2>he was selling illegal ivory.</v>

3458
01:33:59.230 --> 01:34:00.820
<v Speaker 2>They take that shit very seriously.</v>

3459
01:34:00.850 --> 01:34:01.290
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3460
01:34:01.290 --> 01:34:02.380
<v Speaker 2>I lad.</v>

3461
01:34:02.500 --> 01:34:03.760
<v Speaker 2>But you're allowed to have it.</v>

3462
01:34:03.910 --> 01:34:05.980
<v Speaker 2>You're allowed to have the band ivory.</v>

3463
01:34:06.020 --> 01:34:06.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3464
01:34:06.280 --> 01:34:08.320
<v Speaker 2>And the idea is that first of all,</v>

3465
01:34:08.350 --> 01:34:09.340
<v Speaker 2>those animals are dead.</v>

3466
01:34:09.460 --> 01:34:09.881
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3467
01:34:09.881 --> 01:34:11.800
<v Speaker 2>And they killed so many of them,</v>

3468
01:34:11.801 --> 01:34:14.860
<v Speaker 2>so it was worth so much money that between,</v>

3469
01:34:15.250 --> 01:34:20.250
<v Speaker 2>I think it was like 1980 and eight whenever the band was in institute in 1987</v>

3470
01:34:21.581 --> 01:34:21.840
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

3471
01:34:21.840 --> 01:34:24.640
<v Speaker 2>their population dipped by over a million.</v>

3472
01:34:24.641 --> 01:34:28.180
<v Speaker 2>I think they were at like 1.5 million and they were down to 500,000.</v>

3473
01:34:28.840 --> 01:34:29.380
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

3474
01:34:29.380 --> 01:34:30.060
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3475
01:34:30.060 --> 01:34:30.880
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

3476
01:34:30.880 --> 01:34:35.880
<v Speaker 2>it's imperative that people understand that like a lot of the ivory that you use</v>

3477
01:34:36.371 --> 01:34:38.020
<v Speaker 2>today and stuff is like,</v>

3478
01:34:38.021 --> 01:34:39.280
<v Speaker 2>there's so much of it,</v>

3479
01:34:39.520 --> 01:34:41.020
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to kill anything for it.</v>

3480
01:34:41.230 --> 01:34:42.820
<v Speaker 2>And if you don't use it,</v>

3481
01:34:42.970 --> 01:34:46.900
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of fucked because that means somebody murdered these animals for their</v>

3482
01:34:46.901 --> 01:34:49.030
<v Speaker 2>ivory and then didn't use him for things.</v>

3483
01:34:49.060 --> 01:34:49.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3484
01:34:49.720 --> 01:34:52.750
<v Speaker 2>But if you murdered him now and use the robbery for shit,</v>

3485
01:34:52.780 --> 01:34:53.321
<v Speaker 2>it's fucked up.</v>

3486
01:34:53.321 --> 01:34:54.490
<v Speaker 2>Like it's a real gray area.</v>

3487
01:34:54.491 --> 01:34:55.450
<v Speaker 2>If you look at it that way,</v>

3488
01:34:55.720 --> 01:34:56.553
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

3489
01:34:56.830 --> 01:35:01.830
<v Speaker 2>would you be willing to have ivory tusks if you found them in a store in your</v>

3490
01:35:02.031 --> 01:35:02.391
<v Speaker 2>house,</v>

3491
01:35:02.391 --> 01:35:03.110
<v Speaker 2>like mounted?</v>

3492
01:35:03.110 --> 01:35:05.960
<v Speaker 2>They're beautiful and the crazy to look at it and like if you've ever seen him</v>

3493
01:35:05.961 --> 01:35:06.350
<v Speaker 2>in a minute,</v>

3494
01:35:06.350 --> 01:35:09.140
<v Speaker 2>there's a mammoth Tusk at this museum.</v>

3495
01:35:09.170 --> 01:35:10.430
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking fascinating,</v>

3496
01:35:10.431 --> 01:35:11.000
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3497
01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:11.833
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>

3498
01:35:11.960 --> 01:35:14.090
<v Speaker 2>But as far as we know,</v>

3499
01:35:14.091 --> 01:35:15.350
<v Speaker 2>nobody ever shot a mammoth.</v>

3500
01:35:15.410 --> 01:35:16.040
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

3501
01:35:16.040 --> 01:35:16.300
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

3502
01:35:16.300 --> 01:35:16.580
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

3503
01:35:16.580 --> 01:35:20.270
<v Speaker 2>Dealing with an elephant that some dude put a sniper bullet through his fucking</v>

3504
01:35:20.271 --> 01:35:21.210
<v Speaker 2>brain and see,</v>

3505
01:35:21.290 --> 01:35:24.050
<v Speaker 2>I think it make me too sad around probably,</v>

3506
01:35:24.060 --> 01:35:24.600
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

3507
01:35:24.600 --> 01:35:24.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3508
01:35:24.800 --> 01:35:25.420
<v Speaker 2>Because the only,</v>

3509
01:35:25.420 --> 01:35:26.760
<v Speaker 2>there's only one way you get those things.</v>

3510
01:35:26.761 --> 01:35:27.740
<v Speaker 2>And the animal will two ways.</v>

3511
01:35:27.741 --> 01:35:28.730
<v Speaker 2>The animal dies on its own,</v>

3512
01:35:28.731 --> 01:35:29.750
<v Speaker 2>which is pretty fucking rare.</v>

3513
01:35:30.120 --> 01:35:30.290
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3514
01:35:30.290 --> 01:35:32.600
<v Speaker 2>that's not how usually you get to live a long time.</v>

3515
01:35:32.940 --> 01:35:33.740
<v Speaker 2>They can live a long time.</v>

3516
01:35:33.740 --> 01:35:34.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3517
01:35:34.100 --> 01:35:34.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3518
01:35:34.430 --> 01:35:35.450
<v Speaker 2>Or you shoot that.</v>

3519
01:35:35.540 --> 01:35:36.350
<v Speaker 2>That's the other problem.</v>

3520
01:35:36.350 --> 01:35:38.480
<v Speaker 2>They live a long time and they're fucking smart.</v>

3521
01:35:39.290 --> 01:35:39.830
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

3522
01:35:39.830 --> 01:35:40.730
<v Speaker 2>Elephants are smart.</v>

3523
01:35:41.520 --> 01:35:44.900
<v Speaker 2>Elephants a recognize each other after not seeing each other for like 20 years.</v>

3524
01:35:45.500 --> 01:35:46.400
<v Speaker 2>Like it's crazy.</v>

3525
01:35:46.401 --> 01:35:47.234
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy to watch.</v>

3526
01:35:47.270 --> 01:35:48.860
<v Speaker 2>They run over and grab trunks,</v>

3527
01:35:49.010 --> 01:35:53.150
<v Speaker 2>wrap their trunks around each other and from knowing a cuddling practically,</v>

3528
01:35:53.151 --> 01:35:53.984
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

3529
01:35:54.110 --> 01:35:54.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3530
01:35:54.650 --> 01:35:55.031
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

3531
01:35:55.031 --> 01:35:55.490
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

3532
01:35:55.490 --> 01:35:57.800
<v Speaker 2>it's fucked up that year.</v>

3533
01:35:57.801 --> 01:35:58.310
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

3534
01:35:58.310 --> 01:36:00.230
<v Speaker 2>people just slaughtered them for ivory.</v>

3535
01:36:01.080 --> 01:36:02.010
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing too is you're,</v>

3536
01:36:02.620 --> 01:36:06.140
<v Speaker 2>they're killing these big beautiful animals just for one thing and then they're</v>

3537
01:36:06.141 --> 01:36:06.261
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3538
01:36:06.261 --> 01:36:06.381
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3539
01:36:06.381 --> 01:36:06.830
<v Speaker 2>that's cool.</v>

3540
01:36:06.830 --> 01:36:07.750
<v Speaker 2>And then they move along.</v>

3541
01:36:07.800 --> 01:36:09.830
<v Speaker 2>Those animals will fucking kill you too though.</v>

3542
01:36:09.880 --> 01:36:11.020
<v Speaker 2>Are these Elvis got,</v>

3543
01:36:11.030 --> 01:36:11.380
<v Speaker 2>fuck.</v>

3544
01:36:11.380 --> 01:36:12.213
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

3545
01:36:12.350 --> 01:36:13.000
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

3546
01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:16.630
<v Speaker 2>You imagine having to carry that look at the size of that thing in.</v>

3547
01:36:17.330 --> 01:36:18.500
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they have big decks too.</v>

3548
01:36:18.590 --> 01:36:19.910
<v Speaker 2>I think he's trying to go deep,</v>

3549
01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:21.410
<v Speaker 2>but it's like barely has a deck.</v>

3550
01:36:21.440 --> 01:36:21.731
<v Speaker 2>Ooh.</v>

3551
01:36:21.731 --> 01:36:26.731
<v Speaker 2>There is that look at the size of his body as muscles on the thing.</v>

3552
01:36:27.480 --> 01:36:28.520
<v Speaker 2>You ever thought about that?</v>

3553
01:36:28.540 --> 01:36:30.230
<v Speaker 2>That'd be cool if they walk around with that all the time.</v>

3554
01:36:30.290 --> 01:36:31.640
<v Speaker 2>What do you think he squats that guy?</v>

3555
01:36:31.880 --> 01:36:31.971
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

01:36:31.971 --> 01:36:32.930
<v Speaker 2>he could do a house,</v>

3557
01:36:33.110 --> 01:36:34.210
<v Speaker 2>but a whole house on his back.</v>

3558
01:36:34.211 --> 01:36:35.044
<v Speaker 2>He'll squatted.</v>

3559
01:36:35.120 --> 01:36:35.860
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

3560
01:36:35.860 --> 01:36:37.280
<v Speaker 2>Look at the size of his muscles.</v>

3561
01:36:37.310 --> 01:36:39.020
<v Speaker 2>What a freaky fucking animal.</v>

3562
01:36:39.020 --> 01:36:40.430
<v Speaker 2>He just finished wrapping right now.</v>

3563
01:36:40.431 --> 01:36:40.930

01:36:50.270 --> 01:36:52.430
<v Speaker 2>That trunk is completely alien.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Are we allowed to show 'em elephant hogs on your streams?</v>

3583
01:37:09.890 --> 01:37:11.290
<v Speaker 2>It's okay because it's like nature.</v>

3584
01:37:11.310 --> 01:37:12.143
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I think that it's bigger.</v>

3593
01:37:21.140 --> 01:37:21.561
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3594
01:37:21.561 --> 01:37:21.771
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3595
01:37:21.771 --> 01:37:21.900
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

3596
01:37:21.900 --> 01:37:22.880
<v Speaker 2>We just saw it right there.</v>

3597
01:37:22.910 --> 01:37:24.290
<v Speaker 2>Horses ever ridiculous decks.</v>

3598
01:37:26.630 --> 01:37:27.680
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people don't know this.</v>

3599
01:37:27.681 --> 01:37:28.730
<v Speaker 2>Smaller and yeah,</v>

3600
01:37:28.731 --> 01:37:29.510
<v Speaker 2>we'll uh,</v>

3601
01:37:29.510 --> 01:37:31.460
<v Speaker 2>we'll be visiting again with,</v>

3602
01:37:31.461 --> 01:37:32.240
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3603
01:37:32.240 --> 01:37:33.920
<v Speaker 2>our friend Dr. Christopher Ryan.</v>

3604
01:37:34.100 --> 01:37:35.990
<v Speaker 2>He's going to be a pack on the podcast.</v>

3605
01:37:35.991 --> 01:37:37.580
<v Speaker 2>He's the author of that book,</v>

3606
01:37:37.581 --> 01:37:39.500
<v Speaker 2>Sex at dawn and uh,</v>

3607
01:37:39.530 --> 01:37:44.530
<v Speaker 2>he'll be on a Monday the 25th.</v>

3608
01:37:45.170 --> 01:37:46.003
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3609
01:37:46.160 --> 01:37:46.910
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

3610
01:37:46.910 --> 01:37:47.840
<v Speaker 2>looking forward to that.</v>

3611
01:37:47.841 --> 01:37:51.110
<v Speaker 2>But one of the things that he said is that gorillas in his book,</v>

3612
01:37:51.111 --> 01:37:52.460
<v Speaker 2>he talks about Dick size.</v>

3613
01:37:52.670 --> 01:37:55.980
<v Speaker 2>Gorillas have really little decks and the reason they have little dicks</v>

3614
01:37:56.010 --> 01:37:59.760
<v Speaker 8>is because they didn't have to like have a big Dick to dominate.</v>

3615
01:38:00.180 --> 01:38:02.790
<v Speaker 8>They just have a bunch of chicks who listened to them.</v>

3616
01:38:02.970 --> 01:38:04.140
<v Speaker 8>The girls aren't slutty,</v>

3617
01:38:04.290 --> 01:38:06.780
<v Speaker 8>they stay put and he doesn't really need a big Dick.</v>

3618
01:38:06.870 --> 01:38:07.980
<v Speaker 8>So he's got this little tiny,</v>

3619
01:38:07.981 --> 01:38:09.810
<v Speaker 8>tiny dick cause it's not about her,</v>

3620
01:38:09.811 --> 01:38:11.580
<v Speaker 8>it's about him getting on top,</v>

3621
01:38:11.581 --> 01:38:12.414
<v Speaker 8>pinning her down,</v>

3622
01:38:12.540 --> 01:38:14.700
<v Speaker 8>sticking little tiny dick and there she ain't going anywhere.</v>

3623
01:38:14.710 --> 01:38:16.080
<v Speaker 8>He doesn't have to like prove himself to her.</v>

3624
01:38:16.110 --> 01:38:16.620
<v Speaker 8>Right.</v>

3625
01:38:16.620 --> 01:38:20.380
<v Speaker 8>Whereas chimpanzee chicks are whore.</v>

3626
01:38:21.570 --> 01:38:25.050
<v Speaker 8>Chimpanzees don't run any sort of a brothel.</v>

3627
01:38:25.170 --> 01:38:27.510
<v Speaker 8>They don't have like a heroin checks like a gorilla does.</v>

3628
01:38:27.720 --> 01:38:29.250
<v Speaker 8>Chimpanzees can't rock it like that.</v>

3629
01:38:29.251 --> 01:38:31.170
<v Speaker 8>Chimpanzee girls are just too slutty.</v>

3630
01:38:31.530 --> 01:38:32.700
<v Speaker 8>So chimpanzees,</v>

3631
01:38:32.940 --> 01:38:33.773
<v Speaker 8>because of this,</v>

3632
01:38:33.900 --> 01:38:35.430
<v Speaker 8>have enormous testicles.</v>

3633
01:38:35.700 --> 01:38:39.120
<v Speaker 8>And the reason why they have enormous tax goals on a male primate,</v>

3634
01:38:39.300 --> 01:38:44.160
<v Speaker 8>the testicle size is directly proportionate to the amount of promiscuous females</v>

3635
01:38:44.161 --> 01:38:44.994
<v Speaker 8>that are in your area.</v>

3636
01:38:45.060 --> 01:38:45.540
<v Speaker 8>Really?</v>

3637
01:38:45.540 --> 01:38:46.170
<v Speaker 8>Yes.</v>

3638
01:38:46.170 --> 01:38:50.610
<v Speaker 8>So if the females are monogamous and you don't have to compete to earn their</v>

3639
01:38:50.940 --> 01:38:51.780
<v Speaker 8>trust and their,</v>

3640
01:38:51.781 --> 01:38:52.614
<v Speaker 8>their sex,</v>

3641
01:38:52.680 --> 01:38:53.760
<v Speaker 8>your balls shrivel up,</v>

3642
01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:54.833
<v Speaker 8>Dick shrivels up.</v>

3643
01:38:54.840 --> 01:38:56.250
<v Speaker 8>You don't need as much is,</v>

3644
01:38:56.610 --> 01:38:57.443
<v Speaker 8>but when there's,</v>

3645
01:38:57.450 --> 01:38:58.830
<v Speaker 8>when there's competition,</v>

3646
01:38:59.040 --> 01:39:00.660
<v Speaker 8>when there's a lot of shit going down,</v>

3647
01:39:00.870 --> 01:39:03.600
<v Speaker 8>that's when you need to have big balls and a big deck.</v>

3648
01:39:03.960 --> 01:39:07.350
<v Speaker 8>Humans have the biggest dicks out of all the primates.</v>

3649
01:39:07.770 --> 01:39:09.210
<v Speaker 8>Human dicks are bigger than chimps,</v>

3650
01:39:09.211 --> 01:39:10.044
<v Speaker 8>chimps her next.</v>

3651
01:39:10.380 --> 01:39:14.760
<v Speaker 8>But it's because human girls to the sluttiest to the sluts and all the animal</v>

3652
01:39:14.761 --> 01:39:15.360
<v Speaker 8>community.</v>

3653
01:39:15.360 --> 01:39:15.481
<v Speaker 8>Oh,</v>

3654
01:39:15.481 --> 01:39:15.811
<v Speaker 8>right.</v>

3655
01:39:15.811 --> 01:39:15.990
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

3656
01:39:15.990 --> 01:39:17.010
<v Speaker 8>Those dirty bitches.</v>

3657
01:39:17.030 --> 01:39:19.290
<v Speaker 8>So our decks have to oh yeah.</v>

3658
01:39:19.650 --> 01:39:22.380
<v Speaker 8>And the big of the dude's Dick is the most likely bigger,</v>

3659
01:39:22.400 --> 01:39:23.490
<v Speaker 8>the amount of slots he's around.</v>

3660
01:39:23.870 --> 01:39:24.440
<v Speaker 8>Wow.</v>

3661
01:39:24.440 --> 01:39:27.880
<v Speaker 8>And that crazy genetically like in his environment where you know,</v>

3662
01:39:27.900 --> 01:39:31.060
<v Speaker 8>he was born and conceived ball size too.</v>

3663
01:39:31.260 --> 01:39:31.470
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

3664
01:39:31.470 --> 01:39:31.711
<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>

3665
01:39:31.711 --> 01:39:34.260
<v Speaker 8>over the course of obviously generation after generation,</v>

3666
01:39:34.261 --> 01:39:35.610
<v Speaker 8>it's not like it's an instant thing.</v>

3667
01:39:35.790 --> 01:39:36.451
<v Speaker 8>Your mom's a whore,</v>

3668
01:39:36.451 --> 01:39:37.280
<v Speaker 8>you got a giant deck.</v>

3669
01:39:37.280 --> 01:39:38.113
<v Speaker 8>Right.</v>

3670
01:39:40.110 --> 01:39:41.040
<v Speaker 8>It's not like that,</v>

3671
01:39:41.041 --> 01:39:41.874
<v Speaker 8>but,</v>

3672
01:39:42.360 --> 01:39:43.470
<v Speaker 8>but that's the reason for it.</v>

3673
01:39:43.740 --> 01:39:44.520
<v Speaker 8>Wow.</v>

3674
01:39:44.520 --> 01:39:45.270
<v Speaker 8>And then fucked.</v>

3675
01:39:45.270 --> 01:39:45.840
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

3676
01:39:45.840 --> 01:39:46.673
<v Speaker 8>absolutely.</v>

3677
01:39:46.700 --> 01:39:47.533
<v Speaker 8>But it makes sense.</v>

3678
01:39:47.730 --> 01:39:48.041
<v Speaker 8>I mean we,</v>

3679
01:39:48.041 --> 01:39:48.171
<v Speaker 8>we,</v>

3680
01:39:48.171 --> 01:39:48.441
<v Speaker 8>we,</v>

3681
01:39:48.441 --> 01:39:51.120
<v Speaker 8>we look at all sexual things so emotionally,</v>

3682
01:39:51.330 --> 01:39:51.601
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

3683
01:39:51.601 --> 01:39:52.860
<v Speaker 8>we always look at it like,</v>

3684
01:39:53.190 --> 01:39:53.461
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

3685
01:39:53.461 --> 01:39:54.900
<v Speaker 8>we look at it as ourselves,</v>

3686
01:39:55.170 --> 01:39:55.471
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

3687
01:39:55.471 --> 01:39:55.651
<v Speaker 8>like,</v>

3688
01:39:55.651 --> 01:39:55.740
<v Speaker 8>Whoa,</v>

3689
01:39:55.740 --> 01:39:56.041
<v Speaker 8>Whoa,</v>

3690
01:39:56.041 --> 01:39:57.660
<v Speaker 8>what did you care about the fucking,</v>

3691
01:39:57.890 --> 01:39:58.530
<v Speaker 8>what does secure,</v>

3692
01:39:58.530 --> 01:39:59.400
<v Speaker 8>how big my Duke is.</v>

3693
01:39:59.401 --> 01:40:00.190
<v Speaker 8>If you love me,</v>

3694
01:40:00.190 --> 01:40:00.660
<v Speaker 8>you know?</v>

3695
01:40:00.660 --> 01:40:03.130
<v Speaker 8>But nature doesn't care about your emotions at all.</v>

3696
01:40:03.300 --> 01:40:04.470
<v Speaker 8>Nature doesn't care about,</v>

3697
01:40:04.471 --> 01:40:04.711
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

3698
01:40:04.711 --> 01:40:04.951
<v Speaker 8>your,</v>

3699
01:40:04.951 --> 01:40:07.230
<v Speaker 8>your desire for acceptance and it doesn't,</v>

3700
01:40:07.260 --> 01:40:08.400
<v Speaker 8>it cares about numbers.</v>

3701
01:40:08.640 --> 01:40:11.940
<v Speaker 8>It cares about who is going to make the most babies.</v>

3702
01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:13.920
<v Speaker 8>Who's going to be the most effective breeding?</v>

3703
01:40:14.040 --> 01:40:16.980
<v Speaker 8>Who's going to have the bigger dick that's going to transfer to his children</v>

3704
01:40:16.981 --> 01:40:17.880
<v Speaker 8>having a bigger deck?</v>

3705
01:40:17.881 --> 01:40:18.270
<v Speaker 8>What?</v>

3706
01:40:18.270 --> 01:40:21.540
<v Speaker 8>Who's going to have the most ambitious personality that transfers into the</v>

3707
01:40:21.541 --> 01:40:25.860
<v Speaker 8>genetics and passes on epigenetically to offspring and they become more</v>

3708
01:40:25.861 --> 01:40:27.270
<v Speaker 8>aggressive and more ambitious.</v>

3709
01:40:27.271 --> 01:40:29.400
<v Speaker 8>And I mean that's nature favors.</v>

3710
01:40:29.401 --> 01:40:33.750
<v Speaker 8>Nature favors like the numbers of the whole nature isn't really like looking at</v>

3711
01:40:33.751 --> 01:40:35.340
<v Speaker 8>your emotions and your problems.</v>

3712
01:40:35.341 --> 01:40:39.120
<v Speaker 8>Your emotions are basically a trick and all of them are just set up to get you</v>

3713
01:40:39.121 --> 01:40:40.920
<v Speaker 8>to do shit the nature wants you to do.</v>

3714
01:40:41.130 --> 01:40:42.510
<v Speaker 8>Whether it's your emotions for your,</v>

3715
01:40:42.511 --> 01:40:42.751
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

3716
01:40:42.751 --> 01:40:44.340
<v Speaker 8>your connection to your loved ones,</v>

3717
01:40:44.490 --> 01:40:46.110
<v Speaker 8>it's real as it is and it's palpable.</v>

3718
01:40:46.111 --> 01:40:46.944
<v Speaker 8>It is to you.</v>

3719
01:40:46.980 --> 01:40:48.530
<v Speaker 8>It's really also uh,</v>

3720
01:40:48.720 --> 01:40:49.070
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

3721
01:40:49.070 --> 01:40:49.903
<v Speaker 8>it's,</v>

3722
01:40:49.920 --> 01:40:50.390
<v Speaker 8>it's,</v>

3723
01:40:50.390 --> 01:40:54.040
<v Speaker 8>it's sort of a reward system that the universe has set up to</v>

3724
01:40:54.040 --> 01:40:55.930
<v Speaker 5>make sure that you keep interacting with people,</v>

3725
01:40:55.960 --> 01:40:57.490
<v Speaker 5>keep breeding and they,</v>

3726
01:40:57.530 --> 01:41:02.440
<v Speaker 5>and keep perpetuating the civilization in its current form.</v>

3727
01:41:02.650 --> 01:41:04.360
<v Speaker 5>Like all these emotions are all,</v>

3728
01:41:04.530 --> 01:41:08.320
<v Speaker 5>it's all set up to make sure that you keep the universal then give a fuck about</v>

3729
01:41:08.321 --> 01:41:08.870
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

3730
01:41:08.870 --> 01:41:09.370
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3731
01:41:09.370 --> 01:41:10.020
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3732
01:41:10.020 --> 01:41:15.020
<v Speaker 5>Is busy constructing a gram design that you're a part of and that's also your</v>

3733
01:41:16.091 --> 01:41:16.631
<v Speaker 5>big deck.</v>

3734
01:41:16.631 --> 01:41:17.740
<v Speaker 5>You Big Dick as a part of that?</v>

3735
01:41:17.741 --> 01:41:20.530

01:44:15.540 --> 01:44:16.440
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>

3884
01:44:16.441 --> 01:44:17.274
<v Speaker 4>that sucked.</v>

3885
01:44:17.730 --> 01:44:21.330
<v Speaker 4>And I was standing out front and then at the end of the show,</v>

3886
01:44:21.360 --> 01:44:21.901
<v Speaker 4>or actually no,</v>

3887
01:44:21.901 --> 01:44:22.681
<v Speaker 4>the show was still going on.</v>

3888
01:44:22.681 --> 01:44:27.681
<v Speaker 4>I saw him and a woman talking to the manager and she was hysterical,</v>

3889
01:44:30.090 --> 01:44:32.760
<v Speaker 4>like just crying and screaming.</v>

3890
01:44:33.930 --> 01:44:34.710
<v Speaker 4>And I was,</v>

3891
01:44:34.710 --> 01:44:35.910
<v Speaker 4>she didn't know that I was watching.</v>

3892
01:44:35.911 --> 01:44:39.960
<v Speaker 4>I was watching from like 25 feet away and the guy,</v>

3893
01:44:40.440 --> 01:44:43.800
<v Speaker 4>she's telling the manager and I can hear her saying he's such an asshole,</v>

3894
01:44:43.801 --> 01:44:45.150
<v Speaker 4>he's such an asshole.</v>

3895
01:44:45.840 --> 01:44:47.880
<v Speaker 4>And I can hear the manager going,</v>

3896
01:44:48.090 --> 01:44:48.960
<v Speaker 4>he's not an asshole,</v>

3897
01:44:49.200 --> 01:44:50.250
<v Speaker 4>he's not an asshole.</v>

3898
01:44:50.280 --> 01:44:51.113
<v Speaker 4>He's a nice guy.</v>

3899
01:44:51.330 --> 01:44:52.140
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>

3900
01:44:52.140 --> 01:44:53.520
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't believe that he was saying that.</v>

3901
01:44:53.880 --> 01:44:55.650
<v Speaker 4>And then he was like,</v>

3902
01:44:55.651 --> 01:44:56.550
<v Speaker 4>I'll tell you what I'll do,</v>

3903
01:44:56.700 --> 01:44:59.220
<v Speaker 4>I'll give you tickets to come back.</v>

3904
01:44:59.670 --> 01:45:02.940
<v Speaker 4>You tell me any show you want to come to and I'll give you tickets to that.</v>

3905
01:45:03.540 --> 01:45:04.590
<v Speaker 4>And then they were like,</v>

3906
01:45:04.591 --> 01:45:04.981
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

3907
01:45:04.981 --> 01:45:08.190
<v Speaker 4>And they were leaving and then he stopped them and he was like,</v>

3908
01:45:08.340 --> 01:45:09.173
<v Speaker 4>just so you know,</v>

3909
01:45:09.240 --> 01:45:11.520
<v Speaker 4>I can't promise you the same shit won't happen at that next show.</v>

3910
01:45:11.730 --> 01:45:12.563
<v Speaker 4>And they were like,</v>

3911
01:45:12.600 --> 01:45:13.433
<v Speaker 4>I guess so.</v>

3912
01:45:13.440 --> 01:45:13.981
<v Speaker 4>And then they,</v>

3913
01:45:13.981 --> 01:45:14.814
<v Speaker 4>they left.</v>

3914
01:45:15.840 --> 01:45:16.673
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3915
01:45:16.920 --> 01:45:21.920
<v Speaker 4>so I felt badly that I upset a family and I get,</v>

3916
01:45:22.400 --> 01:45:22.521
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3917
01:45:22.521 --> 01:45:23.460
<v Speaker 4>like would upset them.</v>

3918
01:45:23.580 --> 01:45:28.580
<v Speaker 4>But I still think that the joke for the most part was funny.</v>

3919
01:45:28.980 --> 01:45:30.270
<v Speaker 4>Like I thought it was a funny joke,</v>

3920
01:45:30.720 --> 01:45:31.830
<v Speaker 4>the bid or whatever.</v>

3921
01:45:31.860 --> 01:45:34.230
<v Speaker 4>So I kind of thought about it and then,</v>

3922
01:45:35.130 --> 01:45:35.510
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3923
01:45:35.510 --> 01:45:35.751
<v Speaker 4>I like,</v>

3924
01:45:35.751 --> 01:45:37.620
<v Speaker 4>I stopped doing it really out of boredom.</v>

3925
01:45:37.710 --> 01:45:38.560
<v Speaker 4>Not really that I,</v>

3926
01:45:38.980 --> 01:45:40.110
<v Speaker 4>I spent the next show,</v>

3927
01:45:40.111 --> 01:45:41.610
<v Speaker 4>I made a joke about that couple.</v>

3928
01:45:43.710 --> 01:45:46.190
<v Speaker 4>I told him how the lady got upset at me and I was like,</v>

3929
01:45:46.191 --> 01:45:47.220
<v Speaker 4>Hey lady,</v>

3930
01:45:47.221 --> 01:45:47.730
<v Speaker 4>that joke,</v>

3931
01:45:47.730 --> 01:45:48.031
<v Speaker 4>I'm not,</v>

3932
01:45:48.031 --> 01:45:49.380
<v Speaker 4>the one that fills you up was spoiled milk.</v>

3933
01:45:49.381 --> 01:45:50.101
<v Speaker 4>Don't get mad at me.</v>

3934
01:45:50.101 --> 01:45:51.810
<v Speaker 4>Did you say on stage?</v>

3935
01:45:51.840 --> 01:45:52.321
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

3936
01:45:52.321 --> 01:45:53.250
<v Speaker 4>that's fucked up.</v>

3937
01:45:55.350 --> 01:45:58.530
<v Speaker 4>But I mean it wasn't that familiar with spoiled little girl.</v>

3938
01:45:58.560 --> 01:45:59.393
<v Speaker 4>It's so wrong.</v>

3939
01:45:59.490 --> 01:46:01.310
<v Speaker 4>But I really feel like it's,</v>

3940
01:46:01.311 --> 01:46:01.951
<v Speaker 4>it goes back to,</v>

3941
01:46:01.951 --> 01:46:02.671
<v Speaker 4>we were talking about,</v>

3942
01:46:02.671 --> 01:46:03.031
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3943
01:46:03.031 --> 01:46:06.600
<v Speaker 4>and I realized that it's super subjective and people can definitely tell me that</v>

3944
01:46:06.601 --> 01:46:07.800
<v Speaker 4>that joke is not funny.</v>

3945
01:46:07.830 --> 01:46:08.610
<v Speaker 4>I respect that.</v>

3946
01:46:08.610 --> 01:46:09.061
<v Speaker 4>I'm not,</v>

3947
01:46:09.061 --> 01:46:09.894
<v Speaker 4>I'm not in the,</v>

3948
01:46:10.230 --> 01:46:14.370
<v Speaker 4>I don't take the position as I'm going to argue with you about how things are</v>

3949
01:46:14.371 --> 01:46:16.140
<v Speaker 4>funny or something that I said.</v>

3950
01:46:16.830 --> 01:46:18.270
<v Speaker 4>I'm just saying that when I said it,</v>

3951
01:46:18.510 --> 01:46:21.180
<v Speaker 4>I thought it was funny that that's what I'm going out on.</v>

3952
01:46:21.420 --> 01:46:22.830
<v Speaker 4>I thought when I said it was funny,</v>

3953
01:46:23.150 --> 01:46:23.380
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3954
01:46:23.380 --> 01:46:25.650
<v Speaker 4>there are jokes that I've done in the past that I go,</v>

3955
01:46:26.190 --> 01:46:27.030
<v Speaker 4>those are just,</v>

3956
01:46:27.210 --> 01:46:27.480
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

3957
01:46:27.480 --> 01:46:29.250
<v Speaker 4>I mean some of course are easy jokes.</v>

3958
01:46:29.251 --> 01:46:32.310
<v Speaker 4>Some are really just jokes that I get bored of saying it's,</v>

3959
01:46:32.500 --> 01:46:32.860
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

3960
01:46:32.860 --> 01:46:36.240
<v Speaker 4>it's not funny to me anymore now because I didn't think it was a funny thing at</v>

3961
01:46:36.241 --> 01:46:36.770
<v Speaker 4>first.</v>

3962
01:46:36.770 --> 01:46:38.100
<v Speaker 4>We were just bored of it.</v>

3963
01:46:38.130 --> 01:46:38.320
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3964
01:46:38.320 --> 01:46:39.060
<v Speaker 4>I got bored of it,</v>

3965
01:46:39.060 --> 01:46:39.930
<v Speaker 4>so I stopped saying it.</v>

3966
01:46:40.380 --> 01:46:40.621
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3967
01:46:40.621 --> 01:46:42.150
<v Speaker 4>And there's stop with this.</v>

3968
01:46:42.200 --> 01:46:42.800
<v Speaker 4>You don't like it?</v>

3969
01:46:42.800 --> 01:46:43.170
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3970
01:46:43.170 --> 01:46:44.220
<v Speaker 4>I don't want this shit.</v>

3971
01:46:44.400 --> 01:46:45.010
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3972
01:46:45.010 --> 01:46:45.843
<v Speaker 4>why?</v>

3973
01:46:46.030 --> 01:46:47.850
<v Speaker 4>It's like when you,</v>

3974
01:46:47.851 --> 01:46:49.110
<v Speaker 4>when you create a bit,</v>

3975
01:46:49.150 --> 01:46:49.391
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3976
01:46:49.391 --> 01:46:50.170
<v Speaker 4>when you have a bit</v>

3977
01:46:50.170 --> 01:46:52.250
<v Speaker 2>and you do a bit that's like super controversial.</v>

3978
01:46:52.350 --> 01:46:52.870
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3979
01:46:52.870 --> 01:46:55.600
<v Speaker 2>We are essentially doing is you're establishing your parameters.</v>

3980
01:46:55.601 --> 01:46:57.790
<v Speaker 2>Like know if you're going to go see my show,</v>

3981
01:46:57.940 --> 01:46:59.650
<v Speaker 2>you're going to get this.</v>

3982
01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:00.833
<v Speaker 2>You might get this,</v>

3983
01:47:01.330 --> 01:47:02.530
<v Speaker 2>it goes this far.</v>

3984
01:47:02.620 --> 01:47:02.860
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

3985
01:47:02.860 --> 01:47:06.360
<v Speaker 2>and there's certain guys that you know that like you,</v>

3986
01:47:06.361 --> 01:47:07.690
<v Speaker 2>you know when you go see them,</v>

3987
01:47:07.870 --> 01:47:10.390
<v Speaker 2>they're basically not going to talk about anything controversial.</v>

3988
01:47:10.510 --> 01:47:12.310
<v Speaker 2>They're not going to say anything mean or cruel.</v>

3989
01:47:12.400 --> 01:47:12.701
<v Speaker 2>They're not.</v>

3990
01:47:12.701 --> 01:47:14.410
<v Speaker 2>And so you know that guy's parameters too,</v>

3991
01:47:14.440 --> 01:47:14.740
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3992
01:47:14.740 --> 01:47:16.540
<v Speaker 2>Like if you go see Jerry Seinfeld for instance,</v>

3993
01:47:16.720 --> 01:47:19.000
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to get a whole lot of ass to mouth jokes.</v>

3994
01:47:19.660 --> 01:47:24.660
<v Speaker 2>Jerry Seinfeld is dropped so many of his ATM until imagine if he's like,</v>

3995
01:47:24.911 --> 01:47:28.420
<v Speaker 2>if you got divorced and just started doing ecstasy and hit well,</v>

3996
01:47:28.480 --> 01:47:30.010
<v Speaker 2>I realize I'm almost dead.</v>

3997
01:47:30.520 --> 01:47:34.880
<v Speaker 2>So a and I'm ranch so I only go asked him out.</v>

3998
01:47:36.550 --> 01:47:37.390
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to talk to them.</v>

3999
01:47:38.470 --> 01:47:40.900
<v Speaker 2>Why would I talk to you when she'll go ask them out?</v>

4000
01:47:41.470 --> 01:47:42.400
<v Speaker 2>You explained it to me.</v>

4001
01:47:42.430 --> 01:47:42.851
<v Speaker 2>You'd say,</v>

4002
01:47:42.851 --> 01:47:44.230
<v Speaker 2>I'm stupid Jesus.</v>

4003
01:47:44.500 --> 01:47:46.710
<v Speaker 2>She'll go ass to mouth and you won't put it in her ass.</v>

4004
01:47:46.730 --> 01:47:47.740
<v Speaker 2>He was like simple math.</v>

4005
01:47:47.920 --> 01:47:49.480
<v Speaker 2>I just put it in her mouth.</v>

4006
01:47:50.140 --> 01:47:52.630
<v Speaker 2>Why are we arguing when I can just be driving a Porsche?</v>

4007
01:47:53.740 --> 01:47:53.981
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4008
01:47:53.981 --> 01:47:54.730
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4009
01:47:54.730 --> 01:47:55.930
<v Speaker 2>you know that you go see him,</v>

4010
01:47:55.931 --> 01:47:57.700
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to get a midget joke,</v>

4011
01:47:57.730 --> 01:47:58.690
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to get some.</v>

4012
01:47:58.740 --> 01:47:59.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4013
01:47:59.320 --> 01:48:02.650
<v Speaker 2>But this part of like establishing,</v>

4014
01:48:02.980 --> 01:48:07.220
<v Speaker 2>establishing yourself as a comic is you got to know like who's going to say</v>

4015
01:48:07.221 --> 01:48:08.080
<v Speaker 2>fucked up shit.</v>

4016
01:48:08.230 --> 01:48:10.540
<v Speaker 2>And the comedians that say fucked up shit to me,</v>

4017
01:48:11.170 --> 01:48:12.550
<v Speaker 2>even if I don't laugh at it,</v>

4018
01:48:12.580 --> 01:48:15.070
<v Speaker 2>like I'm not particularly fond of midget jokes,</v>

4019
01:48:15.400 --> 01:48:20.400
<v Speaker 2>but I love the fact that a guy is going to do a joke about anything.</v>

4020
01:48:21.011 --> 01:48:23.080
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to worry about pissing people off.</v>

4021
01:48:23.081 --> 01:48:24.970
<v Speaker 2>You're just going to do fucked up what?</v>

4022
01:48:24.971 --> 01:48:29.050
<v Speaker 2>And so like you're in a certain frequency that I enjoy comedy wise.</v>

4023
01:48:29.051 --> 01:48:30.250
<v Speaker 2>Like if I was just a fan,</v>

4024
01:48:30.251 --> 01:48:31.270
<v Speaker 2>if I wasn't a comedian,</v>

4025
01:48:31.271 --> 01:48:32.530
<v Speaker 2>I would totally go see you.</v>

4026
01:48:32.770 --> 01:48:37.770
<v Speaker 2>I'd be psyched because of that element of danger because of that element of,</v>

4027
01:48:39.070 --> 01:48:39.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4028
01:48:39.700 --> 01:48:40.890
<v Speaker 2>fucked up Agnes.</v>

4029
01:48:41.110 --> 01:48:41.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4030
01:48:41.680 --> 01:48:41.950
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

4031
01:48:41.950 --> 01:48:42.783
<v Speaker 2>that's an expense.</v>

4032
01:48:43.090 --> 01:48:43.601
<v Speaker 2>But it isn't it.</v>

4033
01:48:43.601 --> 01:48:46.450
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's like I don't you feel the same way,</v>

4034
01:48:46.670 --> 01:48:48.610
<v Speaker 2>like your favorite kind of comedy we watch,</v>

4035
01:48:48.611 --> 01:48:48.960
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4036
01:48:48.960 --> 01:48:49.141
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4037
01:48:49.141 --> 01:48:50.040
<v Speaker 4>it's why I think I,</v>

4038
01:48:50.100 --> 01:48:50.880
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4039
01:48:50.880 --> 01:48:54.540
<v Speaker 4>I got into comedy because I love comedy and the guy's like,</v>

4040
01:48:54.960 --> 01:48:55.860
<v Speaker 4>I always say it and it,</v>

4041
01:48:55.890 --> 01:48:56.723
<v Speaker 4>I guess it's not,</v>

4042
01:48:56.760 --> 01:48:57.210
<v Speaker 4>it's not,</v>

4043
01:48:57.210 --> 01:48:58.140
<v Speaker 4>it's not entirely fair.</v>

4044
01:48:58.141 --> 01:48:58.890
<v Speaker 4>And I'm aware of that,</v>

4045
01:48:58.890 --> 01:49:00.150
<v Speaker 4>but in my mind,</v>

4046
01:49:00.151 --> 01:49:04.920
<v Speaker 4>what I say to people who as a fan who don't do things like that,</v>

4047
01:49:05.420 --> 01:49:05.730
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

4048
01:49:05.730 --> 01:49:06.810
<v Speaker 4>I just in my mind go,</v>

4049
01:49:06.811 --> 01:49:06.931
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

4050
01:49:06.931 --> 01:49:07.830
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to be bored.</v>

4051
01:49:07.930 --> 01:49:08.200
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4052
01:49:08.200 --> 01:49:08.820
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to be bored.</v>

4053
01:49:08.820 --> 01:49:11.430
<v Speaker 4>I want to see somebody do something fucked up,</v>

4054
01:49:11.460 --> 01:49:12.420
<v Speaker 4>top about fucked up shit.</v>

4055
01:49:12.421 --> 01:49:12.871
<v Speaker 4>I want to talk,</v>

4056
01:49:12.871 --> 01:49:17.871
<v Speaker 4>I want to hear jokes about drugs and sex and fucked up thing because that's what</v>

4057
01:49:18.031 --> 01:49:18.720
<v Speaker 4>makes me laugh.</v>

4058
01:49:18.720 --> 01:49:19.030
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4059
01:49:19.030 --> 01:49:20.790
<v Speaker 4>So that's why I want to see,</v>

4060
01:49:20.820 --> 01:49:23.370
<v Speaker 4>and I want to see people that work in that circle.</v>

4061
01:49:23.400 --> 01:49:24.233
<v Speaker 4>That's what interests me.</v>

4062
01:49:24.380 --> 01:49:24.651
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4063
01:49:24.651 --> 01:49:25.800
<v Speaker 2>That's all that interesting too.</v>

4064
01:49:25.820 --> 01:49:27.230
<v Speaker 2>And for the longest time,</v>

4065
01:49:27.290 --> 01:49:27.770
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4066
01:49:27.770 --> 01:49:30.710
<v Speaker 2>I was told that that was the wrong kind of comedy.</v>

4067
01:49:31.010 --> 01:49:34.610
<v Speaker 2>I was told that you shouldn't do that kind of comedy because it's cheap and easy</v>

4068
01:49:34.611 --> 01:49:35.001
<v Speaker 2>jokes.</v>

4069
01:49:35.001 --> 01:49:35.391
<v Speaker 2>But I was like,</v>

4070
01:49:35.391 --> 01:49:35.841
<v Speaker 2>but God,</v>

4071
01:49:35.841 --> 01:49:36.890
<v Speaker 2>that's what I want to hear.</v>

4072
01:49:36.920 --> 01:49:37.161
<v Speaker 2>That's what,</v>

4073
01:49:37.161 --> 01:49:37.251
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

4074
01:49:37.251 --> 01:49:37.821
<v Speaker 2>that's what you're like,</v>

4075
01:49:37.821 --> 01:49:39.620
<v Speaker 2>when I knew a guy was coming into town,</v>

4076
01:49:39.621 --> 01:49:39.831
<v Speaker 2>when I,</v>

4077
01:49:39.831 --> 01:49:41.770
<v Speaker 2>when I remember when I first started doing standup,</v>

4078
01:49:41.810 --> 01:49:45.530
<v Speaker 2>I went to see like a bunch of stand ups when I first started.</v>

4079
01:49:45.531 --> 01:49:45.870
<v Speaker 2>Like what the,</v>

4080
01:49:45.870 --> 01:49:50.170
<v Speaker 2>for my first year of comedy I was real lucky because that at that time in Boston</v>

4081
01:49:50.320 --> 01:49:52.510
<v Speaker 2>there was a couple big national clubs.</v>

4082
01:49:52.660 --> 01:49:54.520
<v Speaker 2>There wasn't a lot of national clubs back then.</v>

4083
01:49:54.521 --> 01:49:56.140
<v Speaker 2>Like there was an Improv in New York,</v>

4084
01:49:56.230 --> 01:49:59.980
<v Speaker 2>but there wasn't even an Improv it in la yet or not an Improv in la.</v>

4085
01:50:00.070 --> 01:50:01.720
<v Speaker 2>There wasn't even an Improv Boston yet.</v>

4086
01:50:02.110 --> 01:50:07.110
<v Speaker 2>It was an Improv in New York and Improv in La and the Boston one opened I think</v>

4087
01:50:08.381 --> 01:50:13.330
<v Speaker 2>in like 89 or 90 or something along those lines.</v>

4088
01:50:13.331 --> 01:50:13.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4089
01:50:13.780 --> 01:50:18.730
<v Speaker 2>So like the guys who were like wanting to work in like in travel the country,</v>

4090
01:50:18.760 --> 01:50:21.100
<v Speaker 2>there wasn't as many options as there is now.</v>

4091
01:50:21.220 --> 01:50:24.610
<v Speaker 2>So we would get like top level headliners in every week.</v>

4092
01:50:24.880 --> 01:50:27.310
<v Speaker 2>Like catch a rising star and Cambridge,</v>

4093
01:50:27.550 --> 01:50:28.383
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know.</v>

4094
01:50:28.870 --> 01:50:29.651
<v Speaker 2>I think it's under,</v>

4095
01:50:29.651 --> 01:50:30.401
<v Speaker 2>I think it went under,</v>

4096
01:50:30.401 --> 01:50:31.980
<v Speaker 2>which is God damn shame.</v>

4097
01:50:31.990 --> 01:50:33.400
<v Speaker 2>Cause I went to see,</v>

4098
01:50:33.401 --> 01:50:35.080
<v Speaker 2>I saw Kevin Meeney there.</v>

4099
01:50:35.350 --> 01:50:36.170
<v Speaker 2>I saw that was,</v>

4100
01:50:36.170 --> 01:50:37.270
<v Speaker 2>I was in high school.</v>

4101
01:50:37.330 --> 01:50:38.470
<v Speaker 2>I just graduated high school.</v>

4102
01:50:38.471 --> 01:50:39.580
<v Speaker 2>When I saw Kevin me there,</v>

4103
01:50:39.760 --> 01:50:41.500
<v Speaker 2>I saw a rich Jenny there.</v>

4104
01:50:41.680 --> 01:50:46.360
<v Speaker 2>I saw so many comics that were like big name headliners come through and I</v>

4105
01:50:46.420 --> 01:50:48.610
<v Speaker 2>always enjoyed it when they were fucked up.</v>

4106
01:50:48.760 --> 01:50:51.880
<v Speaker 2>I remember I would go way out of my way if I knew that a guy was going to do</v>

4107
01:50:51.881 --> 01:50:52.810
<v Speaker 2>some crazy shit.</v>

4108
01:50:53.050 --> 01:50:53.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4109
01:50:53.440 --> 01:50:55.660
<v Speaker 2>talk about some crazy shit if it went,</v>

4110
01:50:55.770 --> 01:50:57.520
<v Speaker 2>went nutty and if it didn't go nutty.</v>

4111
01:50:57.521 --> 01:50:58.354
<v Speaker 2>I understood.</v>

4112
01:50:58.390 --> 01:50:59.470
<v Speaker 2>I understood it didn't,</v>

4113
01:50:59.680 --> 01:51:02.410
<v Speaker 2>but I was so I would get a giddy joy.</v>

4114
01:51:02.740 --> 01:51:04.600
<v Speaker 2>It's like Doug Stan hope was doing,</v>

4115
01:51:04.900 --> 01:51:06.820
<v Speaker 2>have you heard his new bit about fantasy football?</v>

4116
01:51:08.350 --> 01:51:09.183
<v Speaker 2>Phenomenal.</v>

4117
01:51:09.880 --> 01:51:11.230
<v Speaker 2>It's so fucked up.</v>

4118
01:51:11.710 --> 01:51:12.251
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

4119
01:51:12.251 --> 01:51:15.820
<v Speaker 2>Doug's crowd is so much different than my crowd.</v>

4120
01:51:16.120 --> 01:51:17.230
<v Speaker 2>They're very different.</v>

4121
01:51:17.560 --> 01:51:19.860
<v Speaker 2>They're very different and they're there.</v>

4122
01:51:19.930 --> 01:51:20.261
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

4123
01:51:20.261 --> 01:51:21.670
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's a lot of crossover,</v>

4124
01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:27.000
<v Speaker 2>but his fucking people are ham or really hammer and talking through.</v>

4125
01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:30.160
<v Speaker 2>I mean they were so loud.</v>

4126
01:51:30.200 --> 01:51:32.230
<v Speaker 2>It was w we went to see him at Cincinnati.</v>

4127
01:51:32.231 --> 01:51:33.880
<v Speaker 2>We went to go in and I did,</v>

4128
01:51:33.940 --> 01:51:34.121
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

4129
01:51:34.121 --> 01:51:37.000
<v Speaker 2>we did our show at the Taft and then we came over to go bananas.</v>

4130
01:51:37.700 --> 01:51:37.990
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

4131
01:51:37.990 --> 01:51:39.520
<v Speaker 2>we had a great fucking time go down.</v>

4132
01:51:39.521 --> 01:51:40.450
<v Speaker 2>This is awesome shit.</v>

4133
01:51:40.451 --> 01:51:42.970
<v Speaker 2>And then we went to Mc Levy's,</v>

4134
01:51:42.971 --> 01:51:46.760
<v Speaker 2>we went next door to the bar and standup and I were bartending you bartender too</v>

4135
01:51:46.780 --> 01:51:47.110
<v Speaker 2>for awhile,</v>

4136
01:51:47.110 --> 01:51:47.560
<v Speaker 2>didn't you?</v>

4137
01:51:47.560 --> 01:51:48.880
<v Speaker 2>I bartended for a half hour.</v>

4138
01:51:48.881 --> 01:51:49.810
<v Speaker 2>I was still bartending.</v>

4139
01:51:49.811 --> 01:51:50.351
<v Speaker 2>You guys are gone.</v>

4140
01:51:50.351 --> 01:51:50.591
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

4141
01:51:50.591 --> 01:51:50.831
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

4142
01:51:50.831 --> 01:51:51.730
<v Speaker 2>why am I doing this?</v>

4143
01:51:53.380 --> 01:51:53.621
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4144
01:51:53.621 --> 01:51:56.440
<v Speaker 2>we were handing out drinks and giving away drinks for free.</v>

4145
01:51:56.620 --> 01:52:01.030
<v Speaker 2>I would give away like 10 drinks and then I would just take 100 bucks and throw</v>

4146
01:52:01.031 --> 01:52:01.361
<v Speaker 2>it in the,</v>

4147
01:52:01.361 --> 01:52:02.194
<v Speaker 2>in the the uh,</v>

4148
01:52:02.350 --> 01:52:02.771
<v Speaker 2>tip bear.</v>

4149
01:52:02.771 --> 01:52:03.011
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

4150
01:52:03.011 --> 01:52:03.844
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

4151
01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:04.331
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

4152
01:52:04.331 --> 01:52:05.860
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how much this stuff costs,</v>

4153
01:52:05.861 --> 01:52:08.440
<v Speaker 2>so I'm just giving people booze and I'll just come and start paying for it.</v>

4154
01:52:08.650 --> 01:52:10.210
<v Speaker 2>So I would give people,</v>

4155
01:52:10.211 --> 01:52:10.391
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>

4156
01:52:10.391 --> 01:52:13.040
<v Speaker 2>I was giving out free drinks and then I would throw money in that bucket.</v>

4157
01:52:13.220 --> 01:52:13.660
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

4158
01:52:13.660 --> 01:52:14.890
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it evens out.</v>

4159
01:52:15.250 --> 01:52:19.180
<v Speaker 2>Like we were in Australia and you bought everybody that ever walked into a bar,</v>

4160
01:52:19.181 --> 01:52:20.014
<v Speaker 2>a drink.</v>

4161
01:52:20.350 --> 01:52:21.850
<v Speaker 2>We went off in Australia.</v>

4162
01:52:22.030 --> 01:52:26.230
<v Speaker 2>That was one of the few times in my life where we purposely decided to go deep.</v>

4163
01:52:26.530 --> 01:52:26.741
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4165
01:52:27.430 --> 01:52:27.761
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

4166

<v Speaker 2>me and Tommy and Eddie Bravo,</v>

4167
01:52:29.950 --> 01:52:33.700
<v Speaker 2>we were in Sydney and we went to the movies when we were super disappointed with</v>

4168
01:52:33.701 --> 01:52:35.830
<v Speaker 2>that stupid fucking island.</v>

4169

<v Speaker 2>Leonardo di Caprio.</v>

4172
01:52:38.110 --> 01:52:38.860
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

4173
01:52:38.860 --> 01:52:39.401
<v Speaker 2>psych.</v>

4174
01:52:39.401 --> 01:52:40.570
<v Speaker 2>None of this actually happened.</v>

4175
01:52:40.571 --> 01:52:41.560
<v Speaker 2>I'm actually crazy.</v>

4176
01:52:41.960 --> 01:52:42.400
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>

4177
01:52:42.400 --> 01:52:44.290
<v Speaker 2>we were so angry and we're angry.</v>

4178
01:52:44.291 --> 01:52:45.890
<v Speaker 2>It's so many people that weren't angry.</v>

4179
01:52:45.920 --> 01:52:47.420
<v Speaker 2>That was one that was more upsetting.</v>

4180
01:52:47.690 --> 01:52:48.950
<v Speaker 2>That was way more upsetting.</v>

4181
01:52:49.280 --> 01:52:49.660
<v Speaker 2>Somebody.</v>

4182
01:52:49.660 --> 01:52:50.780
<v Speaker 2>People like that movie.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4184
01:52:51.110 --> 01:52:52.940
<v Speaker 2>So we decided to go to Taiwan on,</v>

4185
01:52:53.120 --> 01:52:56.510
<v Speaker 2>and we went to this local bar and uh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4237
01:54:00.770 --> 01:54:01.370
<v Speaker 2>when we were,</v>

<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

4240
01:54:03.010 --> 01:54:04.010
<v Speaker 2>When everybody's drunk,</v>

4241
01:54:04.310 --> 01:54:05.780
<v Speaker 2>when you're dealing with 20,</v>

4242
01:54:05.781 --> 01:54:06.320
<v Speaker 2>30,</v>

4243
01:54:06.320 --> 01:54:07.670
<v Speaker 2>I mean how many people were there at the end?</v>

4244
01:54:08.490 --> 01:54:09.520
<v Speaker 2>We had a lot of people who are doing,</v>

4245
01:54:10.360 --> 01:54:10.700
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

4246
01:54:10.700 --> 01:54:11.810

01:54:11.811 --> 01:54:12.290
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>

<v Speaker 2>And we're high fiving people.</v>

4249
01:54:13.610 --> 01:54:15.830
<v Speaker 2>But we made sure that everyone was fucked up.</v>

4250
01:54:15.860 --> 01:54:16.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4251
01:54:16.100 --> 01:54:17.630
<v Speaker 2>So we were all in the same boat of course.</v>

4252
01:54:17.660 --> 01:54:18.810
<v Speaker 2>And everyone was very friendly,</v>

4253
01:54:19.120 --> 01:54:23.330
<v Speaker 2>was happy and everybody was friendly and people were all like huggy high five</v>

4254
01:54:23.331 --> 01:54:24.170

4255
01:54:24.171 --> 01:54:24.381
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4256
01:54:24.381 --> 01:54:26.960
<v Speaker 2>they were all friendly and the waiters were happy.</v>

4257
01:54:26.960 --> 01:54:28.010
<v Speaker 2>The bartenders were happy,</v>

4258
01:54:28.011 --> 01:54:28.940
<v Speaker 2>they were all laughing.</v>

4259
01:54:29.090 --> 01:54:32.000
<v Speaker 2>It's like the fact that you can make a moment like that happen,</v>

4260
01:54:32.240 --> 01:54:34.130
<v Speaker 2>but God damn did I pay for it the next day.</v>

4261
01:54:35.110 --> 01:54:36.030
<v Speaker 2>Ooh.</v>

4262
01:54:36.080 --> 01:54:37.190
<v Speaker 2>Give business manager call.</v>

4263
01:54:37.220 --> 01:54:37.671
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

4264
01:54:37.671 --> 01:54:38.504
<v Speaker 2>what happened?</v>

4265
01:54:38.560 --> 01:54:38.900
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4266
01:54:38.900 --> 01:54:39.590
<v Speaker 2>I'm my head.</v>

4267
01:54:39.590 --> 01:54:39.771
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4268
01:54:39.771 --> 01:54:40.000
<v Speaker 2>I did.</v>

4269
01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:41.630
<v Speaker 2>The money was well spent with my,</v>

4270
01:54:41.631 --> 01:54:43.310
<v Speaker 2>my dome was fucking pounds.</v>

4271
01:54:43.820 --> 01:54:48.560
<v Speaker 2>That's the shit thing to do too because the next day like I had a really fire up</v>

4272
01:54:48.561 --> 01:54:49.371
<v Speaker 2>to do this show.</v>

4273
01:54:49.371 --> 01:54:51.200
<v Speaker 2>I was like noticeably slower,</v>

4274
01:54:51.570 --> 01:54:52.130
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

4275
01:54:52.130 --> 01:54:55.610
<v Speaker 2>And I think I was probably even noticeably like slow the next day when the UFC</v>

4276
01:54:55.611 --> 01:54:56.150
<v Speaker 2>was on.</v>

4277
01:54:56.150 --> 01:54:56.451
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

4278
01:54:56.451 --> 01:54:56.720
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

4279
01:54:56.720 --> 01:54:57.051
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

4280
01:54:57.051 --> 01:54:57.920
<v Speaker 2>probably man,</v>

4281
01:54:57.921 --> 01:54:58.820
<v Speaker 2>I got drunk.</v>

4282
01:54:58.821 --> 01:55:00.500
<v Speaker 2>I mean that was pretty God damn drunk.</v>

4283
01:55:00.830 --> 01:55:04.080
<v Speaker 2>You can't get that drunk and bounce bounce right back here.</v>

4284
01:55:04.081 --> 01:55:09.081
<v Speaker 2>Also that drunk coming off of that flight 16 hours or whatever it is.</v>

4285
01:55:09.231 --> 01:55:09.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4286
01:55:09.800 --> 01:55:10.580
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

4287
01:55:10.580 --> 01:55:12.220
<v Speaker 2>but then we didn't like our bodies.</v>

4288
01:55:12.370 --> 01:55:15.560
<v Speaker 2>I already went past like when we should have gone to bed,</v>

4289
01:55:15.590 --> 01:55:18.080
<v Speaker 2>which probably like I know where like in the early evening or something,</v>

4290
01:55:18.620 --> 01:55:21.170
<v Speaker 2>we rolled that out into late night there.</v>

4291
01:55:21.230 --> 01:55:21.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4292
01:55:21.560 --> 01:55:24.830
<v Speaker 2>we did like a full day and change over.</v>

4293
01:55:24.860 --> 01:55:27.800
<v Speaker 2>They say you should do that though to avoid like to,</v>

4294
01:55:27.801 --> 01:55:28.910
<v Speaker 2>to reset your clock.</v>

4295
01:55:29.270 --> 01:55:31.580
<v Speaker 2>They say just have one day where you just stay up,</v>

4296
01:55:31.581 --> 01:55:32.160
<v Speaker 2>stay up,</v>

4297
01:55:32.160 --> 01:55:32.631
<v Speaker 2>stay up.</v>

4298
01:55:32.631 --> 01:55:36.670
<v Speaker 2>So that way when you know 10:00 PM the right time rolls around,</v>

4299
01:55:36.710 --> 01:55:38.390
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be so fucking tired.</v>

4300
01:55:38.630 --> 01:55:39.020
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4301
01:55:39.020 --> 01:55:40.490
<v Speaker 2>if you could just power through.</v>

4302
01:55:40.640 --> 01:55:42.890
<v Speaker 2>But if you take a nap you could fuck the whole,</v>

4303
01:55:43.120 --> 01:55:43.570
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

4304
01:55:43.570 --> 01:55:45.250
<v Speaker 2>Well I've had that where you wake up and you're like,</v>

4305
01:55:45.251 --> 01:55:45.970
<v Speaker 2>we're the fucking marine.</v>

<v Speaker 5>The Melbourne would be more sensitive.</v>

4453
01:58:54.920 --> 01:58:55.990
<v Speaker 5>They're more sensitive,</v>

4454
01:58:56.020 --> 01:58:57.520
<v Speaker 5>but really it was most sensitive.</v>

4455
01:58:57.560 --> 01:58:58.540
<v Speaker 5>It wasn't really the room,</v>

4456
01:58:58.750 --> 01:59:01.180
<v Speaker 5>it was the press like the guy writing the review.</v>

4457
01:59:01.840 --> 01:59:03.190
<v Speaker 5>It's not like the room lost it.</v>

4458
01:59:03.220 --> 01:59:03.690
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

4459
01:59:03.690 --> 01:59:08.350
<v Speaker 5>Instead it made its way into an article about how offensive and racist and stuff</v>

4460
01:59:08.351 --> 01:59:08.590
<v Speaker 5>it was.</v>

4461
01:59:08.590 --> 01:59:08.981
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>

4462
01:59:08.981 --> 01:59:09.390
<v Speaker 5>Horse.</v>

4463
01:59:09.390 --> 01:59:09.640
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4464
01:59:09.640 --> 01:59:10.271
<v Speaker 5>Well most,</v>

4465
01:59:10.271 --> 01:59:12.840
<v Speaker 5>most people that are going to write articles about something getting,</v>

4466
01:59:12.841 --> 01:59:13.010
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

4467
01:59:13.010 --> 01:59:16.100
<v Speaker 5>Excited to be upset because if I,</v>

4468
01:59:16.140 --> 01:59:19.360
<v Speaker 5>even if we're talking right now and you're like right about how fucking much you</v>

4469
01:59:19.361 --> 01:59:20.790
<v Speaker 5>hate American Airlines and be like,</v>

4470
01:59:20.791 --> 01:59:21.311
<v Speaker 5>all right,</v>

4471
01:59:21.311 --> 01:59:22.300
<v Speaker 5>here goes a blog.</v>

4472
01:59:22.301 --> 01:59:23.040
<v Speaker 5>Like oh yeah,</v>

4473
01:59:23.040 --> 01:59:25.110
<v Speaker 5>and I can tell you this story and I just write that.</v>

4474
01:59:25.120 --> 01:59:25.331
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

4475
01:59:25.331 --> 01:59:25.840
<v Speaker 5>of course.</v>

4476
01:59:25.840 --> 01:59:26.950
<v Speaker 5>Like it's fun to write that.</v>

4477
01:59:27.020 --> 01:59:28.300
<v Speaker 5>Did you read that one?</v>

4478
01:59:28.340 --> 01:59:28.770
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

4479
01:59:28.770 --> 01:59:31.900
<v Speaker 5>there was a broader view of a Guy Fieri,</v>

4480
01:59:31.901 --> 01:59:33.100
<v Speaker 5>whatever the fuck his name is,</v>

4481
01:59:33.160 --> 01:59:34.750
<v Speaker 5>restaurant in Manhattan.</v>

4482
01:59:35.050 --> 01:59:36.220
<v Speaker 5>It was so scathing.</v>

4483
01:59:36.221 --> 01:59:36.431
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4484
01:59:36.431 --> 01:59:37.241
<v Speaker 5>It went public.</v>

4485
01:59:37.241 --> 01:59:37.871
<v Speaker 5>Were people like,</v>

4486
01:59:37.871 --> 01:59:38.870
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck?</v>

4487
01:59:38.871 --> 01:59:39.701
<v Speaker 5>Like it was.</v>

4488
01:59:39.701 --> 01:59:41.350
<v Speaker 5>It was such a brutal review.</v>

4489
01:59:41.380 --> 01:59:41.890
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

4490
01:59:41.890 --> 01:59:43.270
<v Speaker 5>I wonder how accurate it was.</v>

4491
01:59:43.300 --> 01:59:43.630
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

4492
01:59:43.630 --> 01:59:45.290
<v Speaker 5>I wonder how I imagined it.</v>

4493
01:59:45.291 --> 01:59:46.150
<v Speaker 5>It's somewhat accurate,</v>

4494
01:59:46.750 --> 01:59:51.750
<v Speaker 5>but some of the hatred for that restaurant comes from that guy's feeling about</v>

4495
01:59:52.001 --> 01:59:53.440
<v Speaker 5>God and not the restaurant.</v>

4496
01:59:53.680 --> 01:59:55.110
<v Speaker 5>If you took a guy out of the equation,</v>

4497
01:59:55.120 --> 01:59:55.960
<v Speaker 5>you just send them there.</v>

4498
01:59:56.010 --> 01:59:56.290
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>

4499
01:59:56.290 --> 01:59:58.000
<v Speaker 5>It would not be as vicious.</v>

4500
01:59:58.180 --> 01:59:58.710
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

4501
01:59:58.710 --> 01:59:58.880
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

4502
01:59:58.880 --> 01:59:59.713
<v Speaker 5>absolutely.</v>

4503
01:59:59.890 --> 02:00:00.670
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

4504
02:00:00.670 --> 02:00:01.503
<v Speaker 5>absolutely.</v>

4505
02:00:01.550 --> 02:00:01.810
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

4506
02:00:01.810 --> 02:00:02.340
<v Speaker 5>it's pro,</v>

4507
02:00:02.340 --> 02:00:02.650
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

4508
02:00:02.650 --> 02:00:03.580
<v Speaker 5>it's also the,</v>

4509
02:00:03.581 --> 02:00:05.110
<v Speaker 5>the hype that comes with that.</v>

4510
02:00:05.111 --> 02:00:05.261
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

4511
02:00:05.261 --> 02:00:06.970
<v Speaker 5>if you want to be a celebrity chef,</v>

4512
02:00:07.210 --> 02:00:10.870
<v Speaker 5>you better knock my dick in the dirt and I come to your fucking place and to go</v>

4513
02:00:10.871 --> 02:00:12.010
<v Speaker 5>there and to get some,</v>

4514
02:00:12.160 --> 02:00:12.993
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4520
02:00:19.030 --> 02:00:20.380
<v Speaker 5>the whole celebrity chef thing.</v>

4521
02:00:20.381 --> 02:00:21.580
<v Speaker 5>It's a very odd thing.</v>

4522
02:00:21.581 --> 02:00:23.200
<v Speaker 5>And then like all of a sudden,</v>

02:00:23.420 --> 02:00:25.840
<v Speaker 5>and we had Julia child and that was it.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4525
02:00:26.260 --> 02:00:27.190
<v Speaker 5>For the longest time.</v>

4526
02:00:27.550 --> 02:00:28.361
<v Speaker 5>Who else did we have?</v>

4527
02:00:28.361 --> 02:00:31.840
<v Speaker 5>Who else is celebrity chef was there a man slept the French,</v>

4528
02:00:31.990 --> 02:00:32.823
<v Speaker 5>the French guy,</v>

4529
02:00:33.130 --> 02:00:34.260
<v Speaker 5>the galloping gourmet.</v>

4530
02:00:34.270 --> 02:00:35.103
<v Speaker 5>Remember that guy?</v>

4531
02:00:35.490 --> 02:00:36.310
<v Speaker 5>Is that,</v>

4532
02:00:36.310 --> 02:00:37.091
<v Speaker 5>I remember the guy who,</v>

4533
02:00:37.091 --> 02:00:38.470
<v Speaker 5>he's been on TV for years now.</v>

4534
02:00:38.530 --> 02:00:39.363
<v Speaker 5>The French guy,</v>

4535
02:00:39.520 --> 02:00:40.353
<v Speaker 5>he's kind of older,</v>

4536
02:00:41.380 --> 02:00:43.360
<v Speaker 5>older French chef.</v>

4537
02:00:43.361 --> 02:00:44.194
<v Speaker 5>I forget his name,</v>

4538
02:00:44.950 --> 02:00:45.783
<v Speaker 5>but he's been on,</v>

4539
02:00:47.160 --> 02:00:47.470
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

4540
02:00:47.470 --> 02:00:47.830
<v Speaker 5>whatever.</v>

4541
02:00:47.830 --> 02:00:48.663
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's everyone.</v>

4542
02:00:49.180 --> 02:00:53.620
<v Speaker 5>It's a fascinating thing because it's like all you had was like a,</v>

4543
02:00:54.070 --> 02:00:59.070
<v Speaker 5>like a couple of examples and then Wolfgang puck got famous.</v>

4544
02:01:00.010 --> 02:01:00.720
<v Speaker 5>That's right.</v>

4545
02:01:00.720 --> 02:01:01.030
<v Speaker 5>He's,</v>

4546
02:01:01.030 --> 02:01:02.200
<v Speaker 5>he's been big for a while now.</v>

4547
02:01:02.230 --> 02:01:02.650
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4548
02:01:02.650 --> 02:01:03.100
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>

4549
02:01:03.100 --> 02:01:06.670
<v Speaker 5>I feel like he's the one that made Emeral got famous for a little bit and people</v>

4550
02:01:06.690 --> 02:01:06.911
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

4551
02:01:06.911 --> 02:01:08.500
<v Speaker 5>will you shut the fuck up with that?</v>

4552
02:01:08.501 --> 02:01:09.334
<v Speaker 5>Bam.</v>

4553
02:01:09.430 --> 02:01:10.300
<v Speaker 5>Stop that.</v>

4554
02:01:10.470 --> 02:01:11.200
<v Speaker 5>Because he was like,</v>

4555
02:01:11.200 --> 02:01:12.033
<v Speaker 5>damn,</v>

4556
02:01:12.820 --> 02:01:13.601
<v Speaker 5>he knew that.</v>

4557
02:01:13.601 --> 02:01:15.070
<v Speaker 5>Like he needed a tagline.</v>

4558
02:01:15.100 --> 02:01:15.230
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

4559
02:01:15.230 --> 02:01:15.911
<v Speaker 5>exactly.</v>

4560
02:01:15.911 --> 02:01:16.091
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4561
02:01:16.091 --> 02:01:18.400
<v Speaker 5>But he just shoved it right down her throat.</v>

4562
02:01:18.401 --> 02:01:19.234
<v Speaker 5>That's right.</v>

4563
02:01:19.390 --> 02:01:20.380
<v Speaker 5>And then we got Bordain,</v>

4564
02:01:20.440 --> 02:01:21.130
<v Speaker 5>which is awesome.</v>

4565
02:01:21.130 --> 02:01:21.340

<v Speaker 5>boardings the first,</v>

4567
02:01:22.240 --> 02:01:25.210
<v Speaker 5>I think an example of what a kitchen is really staffed with,</v>

4568
02:01:25.240 --> 02:01:25.720
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

4569
02:01:25.720 --> 02:01:26.270
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

4570
02:01:26.270 --> 02:01:30.250
<v Speaker 5>wild punk rocker type dudes with Mexicans working side by side.</v>

4571
02:01:30.260 --> 02:01:30.890
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4572
02:01:30.890 --> 02:01:31.270
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

4573
02:01:31.270 --> 02:01:32.680
<v Speaker 5>and he's honest about the experience.</v>

4574
02:01:33.090 --> 02:01:34.120
<v Speaker 5>That's what it's awesome.</v>

4575
02:01:34.480 --> 02:01:34.721
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4576
02:01:34.721 --> 02:01:35.554
<v Speaker 5>And he has a,</v>

4577
02:01:35.660 --> 02:01:38.320
<v Speaker 5>a genuine passion for cooking.</v>

4578
02:01:38.321 --> 02:01:38.860
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4579

<v Speaker 8>stuff like that,</v>

4584
02:01:49.031 --> 02:01:50.800

4588
02:01:58.931 --> 02:01:59.290
<v Speaker 8>and,</v>

4589
02:01:59.290 --> 02:02:04.290
<v Speaker 8>and how hard it is and how much of a fucking stressful like high stress,</v>

<v Speaker 4>chef.</v>

4614
02:03:02.110 --> 02:03:02.990
<v Speaker 4>So it would pop up,</v>

4615
02:03:03.680 --> 02:03:05.330
<v Speaker 4>it would fill out every night,</v>

4616
02:03:05.331 --> 02:03:09.360
<v Speaker 4>would be booked out and then he would shut shop and then like go away for awhile</v>

4617
02:03:09.410 --> 02:03:11.600
<v Speaker 4>and do whatever he does and then be like,</v>

4618
02:03:11.601 --> 02:03:13.610
<v Speaker 4>Hey July I'm coming to,</v>

02:03:16.440 --> 02:03:17.810
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to take over that one restaurant.</v>

4623
02:03:17.960 --> 02:03:19.190
<v Speaker 4>How does he let people know?</v>

4624
02:03:19.520 --> 02:03:21.890
<v Speaker 4>Well it's the word of mouth really spread.</v>

4625
02:03:22.250 --> 02:03:25.970
<v Speaker 4>Like my cousin is the one that let me know about it and we went there and we</v>

4626
02:03:25.971 --> 02:03:27.560
<v Speaker 4>ordered one of everything on the menu.</v>

4627
02:03:27.770 --> 02:03:28.880
<v Speaker 4>Like that's how,</v>

4628
02:03:29.090 --> 02:03:30.200
<v Speaker 4>cause it's not like,</v>

4629
02:03:30.430 --> 02:03:31.790
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't like full portion size,</v>

4630
02:03:31.791 --> 02:03:35.210
<v Speaker 4>it was like tasting style and it was just incredible.</v>

4631
02:03:35.330 --> 02:03:39.380
<v Speaker 4>And it's the kind of place you walk away and then you start telling people like</v>

4632
02:03:39.410 --> 02:03:39.890
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

4633
02:03:39.890 --> 02:03:42.500
<v Speaker 4>That's a really spreads like wildfire.</v>

4634
02:03:42.501 --> 02:03:45.470
<v Speaker 4>And then now he was on a food show last year.</v>

4635
02:03:45.471 --> 02:03:49.130
<v Speaker 4>He's a judge on that show that Bourdain is hosting.</v>

4636
02:03:49.580 --> 02:03:50.380

02:06:11.071 --> 02:06:11.760
<v Speaker 2>healthy.</v>

4740
02:06:11.760 --> 02:06:12.170
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

4741
02:06:12.170 --> 02:06:12.291
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

4742
02:06:12.291 --> 02:06:13.230
<v Speaker 2>the waffles asshole.</v>

4743
02:06:13.260 --> 02:06:13.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4744
02:06:13.500 --> 02:06:14.011
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

4745
02:06:14.011 --> 02:06:15.630
<v Speaker 2>I'll punish myself later at the gym.</v>

4746
02:06:15.870 --> 02:06:16.410
<v Speaker 2>Trust me,</v>

4747
02:06:16.410 --> 02:06:16.600
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

4748
02:06:16.600 --> 02:06:17.640
<v Speaker 2>I'm disciplined,</v>

4749
02:06:17.910 --> 02:06:22.590
<v Speaker 2>but right now I'm gonna beat the fuck out of this waffle and I'm going to have a</v>

4750
02:06:22.591 --> 02:06:25.650
<v Speaker 2>regular coke fuck a diet coke because why play games?</v>

4751
02:06:25.651 --> 02:06:25.921
<v Speaker 2>Sugar,</v>

4752
02:06:25.921 --> 02:06:26.191
<v Speaker 2>sugar,</v>

4753
02:06:26.191 --> 02:06:26.640
<v Speaker 2>sugar.</v>

4754
02:06:26.640 --> 02:06:27.473
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

4755
02:06:27.570 --> 02:06:29.490
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to pretend that I have a diet coke.</v>

4756
02:06:29.491 --> 02:06:29.641
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4757
02:06:29.641 --> 02:06:31.470
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to have a regular coke and a cup of coffee.</v>

4758
02:06:31.650 --> 02:06:34.800
<v Speaker 2>A Cup of coffee is to allow me to stay conscious long enough to walk to the car,</v>

4759
02:06:34.830 --> 02:06:36.510
<v Speaker 2>get me super excited about this shit.</v>

4760
02:06:36.511 --> 02:06:37.344
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

4761
02:06:37.680 --> 02:06:41.430
<v Speaker 2>There should be a Roscoe's chicken and waffles and every country it's one of</v>

4762
02:06:41.431 --> 02:06:42.270
<v Speaker 2>those 600 words.</v>

4763
02:06:42.271 --> 02:06:44.550
<v Speaker 2>You don't forget it because somebody pitches it to you and you're like,</v>

4764
02:06:44.551 --> 02:06:45.660
<v Speaker 2>what if you have never had it?</v>

4765
02:06:45.690 --> 02:06:46.081
<v Speaker 2>What's that?</v>

4766
02:06:46.081 --> 02:06:46.980
<v Speaker 2>I'll let chickens.</v>

4767
02:06:46.981 --> 02:06:47.461
<v Speaker 2>Very,</v>

4768
02:06:47.461 --> 02:06:47.941
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

4769
02:06:47.941 --> 02:06:52.620
<v Speaker 2>very good delicious fried chicken and it's very homestyle fried chicken.</v>

4770
02:06:52.620 --> 02:06:55.110
<v Speaker 2>Like it tastes like somebody made it in their house.</v>

4771
02:06:55.111 --> 02:06:57.780
<v Speaker 2>Whereas like sometimes you go to Kentucky Fried Chicken,</v>

4772
02:06:57.781 --> 02:07:02.781
<v Speaker 2>it's so uniform and it has like a certain amount of sodium tastes that it's like</v>

4773
02:07:03.360 --> 02:07:05.200
<v Speaker 2>this is a mix and you know you got,</v>

4774
02:07:05.860 --> 02:07:06.750
<v Speaker 2>you need Roscoe's.</v>

4775
02:07:06.751 --> 02:07:08.940
<v Speaker 2>It feels like somebody actually crack some eggs.</v>

4776
02:07:08.941 --> 02:07:10.890
<v Speaker 2>Actually dip the chicken in.</v>

4777
02:07:10.891 --> 02:07:15.891
<v Speaker 2>It actually rolled in and flour and deep fried the fuck out of that shit's so</v>

4778
02:07:17.120 --> 02:07:18.030
<v Speaker 2>Roscoe's on Pico.</v>

4779
02:07:18.031 --> 02:07:18.650
<v Speaker 2>I see you.</v>

4780
02:07:18.650 --> 02:07:22.050
<v Speaker 2>I'll see you Holla out to Roscoe's on Gower.</v>

4781
02:07:23.640 --> 02:07:24.473
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4782
02:07:24.620 --> 02:07:26.190
<v Speaker 2>that's a beautiful combination.</v>

4783
02:07:26.220 --> 02:07:27.053
<v Speaker 2>It's fantastic.</v>

4784
02:07:27.090 --> 02:07:28.470
<v Speaker 2>Didn't seem like it would work.</v>

4785
02:07:28.500 --> 02:07:29.333
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4786
02:07:29.640 --> 02:07:31.350
<v Speaker 2>if you looked at it on paper you'd be like,</v>

4787
02:07:31.351 --> 02:07:32.250
<v Speaker 2>how's this gonna work?</v>

4788
02:07:32.340 --> 02:07:32.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4789
02:07:32.600 --> 02:07:33.251
<v Speaker 2>Chicken and why?</v>

4790
02:07:33.251 --> 02:07:34.470
<v Speaker 2>Why would I want to have those two together?</v>

4791
02:07:34.680 --> 02:07:35.740
<v Speaker 2>One of the you fuck</v>

4792
02:07:36.370 --> 02:07:36.641
<v Speaker 8>no,</v>

4793
02:07:36.641 --> 02:07:37.474
<v Speaker 8>it's perfect.</v>

4794
02:07:37.900 --> 02:07:38.733
<v Speaker 8>Oh boy.</v>

4796
02:07:39.581 --> 02:07:41.760
<v Speaker 8>Now I want to go get chicken and waffles side of it.</v>

4797
02:07:41.920 --> 02:07:42.281
<v Speaker 8>So,</v>

4798
02:07:42.281 --> 02:07:42.521
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>

4799
02:07:42.521 --> 02:07:43.350
<v Speaker 8>before we wrap up,</v>

4800
02:07:43.350 --> 02:07:45.460
<v Speaker 8>I mean we were going to talk to them a little buddy Brian.</v>

4801
02:07:45.520 --> 02:07:45.910
<v Speaker 8>Sure.</v>

4802
02:07:45.910 --> 02:07:46.390
<v Speaker 8>And uh,</v>

4803
02:07:46.390 --> 02:07:46.601
<v Speaker 8>say,</v>

4804
02:07:46.601 --> 02:07:50.090
<v Speaker 8>what'd you think about our guests with the crazy UFO talk fell.</v>

4805
02:07:51.270 --> 02:07:52.650
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

4806
02:07:54.090 --> 02:07:56.460
<v Speaker 3>well I'm being nice being nice.</v>

4807
02:07:57.300 --> 02:07:58.890
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4808
02:07:58.891 --> 02:08:00.990
<v Speaker 3>he said he could talk to aliens,</v>

4809
02:08:01.740 --> 02:08:02.490
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

4810
02:08:02.490 --> 02:08:02.880
<v Speaker 3>He's a,</v>

4811
02:08:02.880 --> 02:08:04.200
<v Speaker 3>he did say that right.</v>

4812
02:08:04.710 --> 02:08:06.510
<v Speaker 3>At one point you sit down when he was younger,</v>

4813
02:08:06.511 --> 02:08:07.300
<v Speaker 3>he could,</v>

4814
02:08:07.300 --> 02:08:08.780
<v Speaker 3>he found a way to communicate,</v>

4815
02:08:09.170 --> 02:08:11.540
<v Speaker 3>meditated at a Tantrum,</v>

4816
02:08:11.750 --> 02:08:16.750
<v Speaker 8>thought and meditation was able to have something that he was describing that</v>

4817
02:08:16.761 --> 02:08:19.850
<v Speaker 8>sounded to me very much like a drug experience.</v>

4818
02:08:19.851 --> 02:08:22.370
<v Speaker 8>Like a psychedelic drug or a meditation experience.</v>

4819
02:08:22.371 --> 02:08:24.260
<v Speaker 8>Some sort of a breakthrough,</v>

4820
02:08:24.770 --> 02:08:25.630
<v Speaker 8>sort of a,</v>

4821
02:08:26.090 --> 02:08:26.570
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

4822
02:08:26.570 --> 02:08:29.630
<v Speaker 3>I mean he seemed like a nice guy and he seemed intelligent.</v>

4823
02:08:30.440 --> 02:08:31.610
<v Speaker 3>But my,</v>

4824
02:08:32.780 --> 02:08:35.290
<v Speaker 3>my bullshit meter just was out of control and,</v>

4825
02:08:35.310 --> 02:08:35.511
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

4826
02:08:35.511 --> 02:08:36.470
<v Speaker 3>and when that happens,</v>

4827
02:08:36.780 --> 02:08:37.090
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

4828
02:08:37.090 --> 02:08:40.750
<v Speaker 3>the were so many things like wanted to like talk to them about,</v>

4829
02:08:40.760 --> 02:08:44.560
<v Speaker 3>but I also didn't want to like be confrontational or confrontation though.</v>

4830
02:08:45.130 --> 02:08:45.790
<v Speaker 3>I don't know man.</v>

4831
02:08:45.790 --> 02:08:46.640
<v Speaker 3>I don't buy any of it.</v>

4832
02:08:46.800 --> 02:08:47.633
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>

4833
02:08:47.760 --> 02:08:51.480
<v Speaker 8>I respect the guy for coming on and talking and I don't,</v>

4834
02:08:51.481 --> 02:08:51.750
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

4835
02:08:51.750 --> 02:08:56.750
<v Speaker 8>I don't know whether or not he's right or telling the truth and I don't feel</v>

4836
02:08:57.361 --> 02:08:58.500
<v Speaker 8>it's ever true.</v>

4837
02:08:58.530 --> 02:08:58.801
<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>

4838
02:08:58.801 --> 02:08:59.670
<v Speaker 8>I have in the past,</v>

4839
02:08:59.671 --> 02:09:00.121
<v Speaker 8>don't get me wrong,</v>

4840
02:09:00.121 --> 02:09:00.841
<v Speaker 8>I'm not a hypocrite.</v>

4841
02:09:00.841 --> 02:09:04.560
<v Speaker 8>I'm just a person who was involved or tried to evolve my conversational skills.</v>

4842
02:09:05.010 --> 02:09:08.910
<v Speaker 8>And one of the things that I try not to do is ever called bullshit.</v>

4843
02:09:08.911 --> 02:09:12.330
<v Speaker 8>If I'm not 100% sure I can believe I can be like,</v>

4844
02:09:12.360 --> 02:09:14.040
<v Speaker 8>I am positive this guy's full of shit.</v>

4845
02:09:14.160 --> 02:09:15.420
<v Speaker 8>But if I don't have any proof,</v>

4846
02:09:16.170 --> 02:09:17.100
<v Speaker 8>how can I call bullshit?</v>

4847
02:09:17.280 --> 02:09:20.400
<v Speaker 8>I can call bullshit on some of the things he says if they don't make any sense.</v>

4848
02:09:20.670 --> 02:09:21.150
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>

4849
02:09:21.150 --> 02:09:24.120
<v Speaker 8>if some of the things he says don't line up with facts,</v>

4850
02:09:24.150 --> 02:09:25.290
<v Speaker 8>you can call bullshit on that.</v>

4851
02:09:25.291 --> 02:09:29.250
<v Speaker 8>But I don't really know whether or not he can actually do that until I go and</v>

4852
02:09:29.251 --> 02:09:29.670
<v Speaker 8>see it.</v>

4853
02:09:29.670 --> 02:09:31.230
<v Speaker 8>So I plan on going and seeing it.</v>

4854
02:09:31.290 --> 02:09:33.120
<v Speaker 8>I mean we're going to do that for that show for,</v>

4855
02:09:33.190 --> 02:09:33.960
<v Speaker 8>for Bam,</v>

4856
02:09:33.960 --> 02:09:34.531
<v Speaker 8>for question.</v>

4857
02:09:34.531 --> 02:09:35.160
<v Speaker 8>Everything.</v>

4858
02:09:35.160 --> 02:09:35.993
<v Speaker 8>We're going to go,</v>

4859
02:09:36.210 --> 02:09:37.410
<v Speaker 8>we're going to go out to the fucking desert.</v>

4860
02:09:37.411 --> 02:09:37.591
<v Speaker 8>Him,</v>

4861
02:09:37.591 --> 02:09:38.730
<v Speaker 8>Eddie Bravo is going to come to,</v>

4862
02:09:39.390 --> 02:09:42.250
<v Speaker 8>I just think it'd be perfect cause Eddie loves him some Ufo shows</v>

4863
02:09:42.430 --> 02:09:42.940
<v Speaker 3>and then,</v>

4864
02:09:42.940 --> 02:09:43.720
<v Speaker 3>and then,</v>

4865
02:09:43.720 --> 02:09:45.580
<v Speaker 3>and then there was like the thing where he,</v>

4866
02:09:45.581 --> 02:09:46.414
<v Speaker 3>he sits in his,</v>

4867
02:09:46.670 --> 02:09:50.000
<v Speaker 3>in the desert and he shines lasers in the sky and you know,</v>

4868
02:09:50.001 --> 02:09:50.760
<v Speaker 3>he says that he,</v>

4869
02:09:50.760 --> 02:09:55.730
<v Speaker 3>it's 100% and then you go to his youtube page to see what he's talking about is</v>

4870
02:09:55.731 --> 02:09:58.110
<v Speaker 3>100% and it's like one,</v>

4871
02:09:58.180 --> 02:09:58.851
<v Speaker 3>why is he shining?</v>

4872
02:09:58.851 --> 02:10:00.770
<v Speaker 3>Lasers at airplanes are up in the sky.</v>

4873
02:10:00.771 --> 02:10:01.850
<v Speaker 3>That's like against the law,</v>

4874
02:10:02.030 --> 02:10:02.541
<v Speaker 3>but to,</v>

4875
02:10:02.541 --> 02:10:05.090
<v Speaker 3>it's like his evidence is like,</v>

4876
02:10:05.180 --> 02:10:05.480
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

4877
02:10:05.480 --> 02:10:08.780
<v Speaker 3>you just see that flashing.in the middle of the sky out of nowhere.</v>

4878
02:10:08.840 --> 02:10:11.090
<v Speaker 3>That's his alien communication.</v>

4879
02:10:11.120 --> 02:10:12.920
<v Speaker 3>And that could be a million things.</v>

4880
02:10:12.921 --> 02:10:13.161
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4881
02:10:13.161 --> 02:10:14.120
<v Speaker 3>you see a little flashing guy.</v>

4882
02:10:14.121 --> 02:10:15.980
<v Speaker 3>It could be a shooting star,</v>

4883
02:10:16.130 --> 02:10:16.851
<v Speaker 3>it could be,</v>

4884
02:10:16.851 --> 02:10:17.241
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4885
02:10:17.241 --> 02:10:18.140
<v Speaker 3>just anything.</v>

4886
02:10:18.410 --> 02:10:20.060
<v Speaker 3>It's way wackier than that gets</v>

4887
02:10:20.060 --> 02:10:21.020
<v Speaker 8>way wackier than that.</v>

4888
02:10:21.080 --> 02:10:24.230
<v Speaker 8>There's actually video that I watched after the interview that I really wish I</v>

4889
02:10:24.231 --> 02:10:25.190
<v Speaker 8>had watched before.</v>

4890
02:10:25.390 --> 02:10:25.520
<v Speaker 8>I,</v>

4891
02:10:25.520 --> 02:10:25.770
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

4892
02:10:25.770 --> 02:10:27.170
<v Speaker 8>you can only watch so much of that stuff,</v>

4893
02:10:27.200 --> 02:10:27.830
<v Speaker 8>right.</v>

4894
02:10:27.830 --> 02:10:29.930
<v Speaker 8>But where he said that he was,</v>

4895
02:10:29.931 --> 02:10:30.110
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

4896
02:10:30.110 --> 02:10:35.110
<v Speaker 8>he was leading a crew and that they were of a craft at one point in time,</v>

4897
02:10:36.021 --> 02:10:37.220
<v Speaker 8>it was an interdimensional craft,</v>

4898
02:10:37.221 --> 02:10:39.160
<v Speaker 8>their standing in the middle of field and they sense that he,</v>

4899
02:10:39.610 --> 02:10:40.071
<v Speaker 8>he was like,</v>

4900
02:10:40.071 --> 02:10:44.060
<v Speaker 8>and some people said they saw me disappear for a moment and as I,</v>

4901
02:10:44.830 --> 02:10:45.470
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

4902
02:10:45.470 --> 02:10:48.080
<v Speaker 8>crossed into this area and that we,</v>

4903
02:10:48.081 --> 02:10:48.231
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

4904
02:10:48.231 --> 02:10:49.520
<v Speaker 8>we could see it in front of you.</v>

4905
02:10:49.521 --> 02:10:51.110
<v Speaker 8>Like it was sort of like a fog.</v>

4906
02:10:51.590 --> 02:10:52.220
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>

4907
02:10:52.220 --> 02:10:52.551
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

4908
02:10:52.551 --> 02:10:53.660
<v Speaker 8>what we know is real</v>

4909
02:10:55.080 --> 02:10:55.411
<v Speaker 3>fog.</v>

4910
02:10:55.411 --> 02:10:56.450
<v Speaker 3>Fog is fucking real.</v>

4911
02:10:56.700 --> 02:10:57.360
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

4912
02:10:57.360 --> 02:10:58.620
<v Speaker 3>So if you see fog,</v>

4913
02:10:58.621 --> 02:11:02.070
<v Speaker 3>you should assume that shit is fog and I fucking spaceship.</v>

4914
02:11:02.340 --> 02:11:03.173
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

4915
02:11:03.270 --> 02:11:04.760
<v Speaker 3>What was that thing at the handoffs?</v>

4916
02:11:04.761 --> 02:11:06.480
<v Speaker 3>So like I might have got this wrong,</v>

4917
02:11:06.481 --> 02:11:11.481
<v Speaker 3>but it sounded like he said you can buy the movie and then once you buy it you</v>

4918
02:11:12.721 --> 02:11:15.240
<v Speaker 3>can put it for sale on your website.</v>

4919
02:11:15.870 --> 02:11:16.800
<v Speaker 3>And then you know,</v>

4920
02:11:16.801 --> 02:11:20.040
<v Speaker 3>like it almost sounded like he was saying like it's a pyramid scheme.</v>

4921
02:11:20.110 --> 02:11:22.180
<v Speaker 8>Well it's not a pyramid scheme.</v>

4922
02:11:22.210 --> 02:11:23.500
<v Speaker 8>It's a promotional scheme,</v>

4923
02:11:23.530 --> 02:11:24.520
<v Speaker 8>a pyramid scheme.</v>

4924
02:11:24.580 --> 02:11:27.130
<v Speaker 8>There's really no nothing of value.</v>

4925
02:11:27.370 --> 02:11:31.780
<v Speaker 8>The way a pyramid scheme works is you get money when you get other people to put</v>

4926
02:11:31.781 --> 02:11:32.230
<v Speaker 8>in money.</v>

4927
02:11:32.230 --> 02:11:36.580
<v Speaker 8>So like say if you're the guy who starts a scheme and you have three people that</v>

4928
02:11:36.581 --> 02:11:39.400
<v Speaker 8>are in that are in the scheme with you and you say,</v>

4929
02:11:39.401 --> 02:11:39.821
<v Speaker 8>listen,</v>

4930
02:11:39.821 --> 02:11:44.080
<v Speaker 8>if you get a dude to give 100 bucks for every hundred bucks,</v>

4931
02:11:44.140 --> 02:11:46.030
<v Speaker 8>you get 25 bucks and they start making money.</v>

4932
02:11:46.031 --> 02:11:47.060
<v Speaker 8>That's what I'm saying.</v>

4933
02:11:47.500 --> 02:11:48.370
<v Speaker 8>That's not a pyramid scheme.</v>

4934
02:11:48.371 --> 02:11:48.601
<v Speaker 8>You know what?</v>

4935
02:11:48.601 --> 02:11:49.434
<v Speaker 8>You don't understand it.</v>

4936
02:11:49.450 --> 02:11:52.960
<v Speaker 8>A pyramid scheme is at the end you find there's nothing of value.</v>

4937
02:11:53.080 --> 02:11:57.370
<v Speaker 8>And at the end what it is is that it depends on more people donating money.</v>

4938
02:11:57.610 --> 02:12:00.580
<v Speaker 8>Then there's people extracting money and as soon as the people want their money,</v>

4939
02:12:00.610 --> 02:12:01.780
<v Speaker 8>you're fucked because there's no money.</v>

4940
02:12:01.780 --> 02:12:02.920
<v Speaker 8>That's what happened with,</v>

4941
02:12:02.921 --> 02:12:03.720
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>

4942
02:12:03.720 --> 02:12:04.051
<v Speaker 8>that,</v>

4943
02:12:04.051 --> 02:12:04.330
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

4944
02:12:04.330 --> 02:12:05.800
<v Speaker 8>that it's called a Ponzi scheme.</v>

4945
02:12:05.801 --> 02:12:07.750
<v Speaker 8>That's what happened with Bernie Madoff.</v>

4946
02:12:07.780 --> 02:12:08.470
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

4947
02:12:08.470 --> 02:12:09.191
<v Speaker 8>that's what it was.</v>

4948
02:12:09.191 --> 02:12:09.490
<v Speaker 8>It was,</v>

4949
02:12:09.490 --> 02:12:12.070
<v Speaker 8>there was no actual value to anything.</v>

4950
02:12:12.100 --> 02:12:14.950
<v Speaker 8>What he's doing is he's offering you,</v>

4951
02:12:15.160 --> 02:12:16.510
<v Speaker 8>he has this video.</v>

4952
02:12:16.750 --> 02:12:17.290
<v Speaker 8>Okay,</v>

4953
02:12:17.290 --> 02:12:21.880
<v Speaker 8>and if you put a link on your site and he's selling the video for five bucks,</v>

4954
02:12:21.881 --> 02:12:25.570
<v Speaker 8>he's selling a product and if he's selling this video for five bucks,</v>

4955
02:12:25.571 --> 02:12:29.770
<v Speaker 8>if you put a link on your site and the clicks go through your site,</v>

4956
02:12:30.040 --> 02:12:31.060
<v Speaker 8>it registers.</v>

4957
02:12:31.090 --> 02:12:32.530
<v Speaker 8>And so you get a piece,</v>

4958
02:12:32.890 --> 02:12:34.060
<v Speaker 8>whatever that piece is,</v>

4959
02:12:34.061 --> 02:12:34.930
<v Speaker 8>it's negotiated.</v>

4960
02:12:34.931 --> 02:12:38.200
<v Speaker 8>Whether it's 10 cents a video or a dollar a video or whatever the fuck it is.</v>

4961
02:12:38.201 --> 02:12:39.040
<v Speaker 8>I don't know how much you get,</v>

4962
02:12:39.250 --> 02:12:40.061
<v Speaker 8>but whatever you get,</v>

4963
02:12:40.061 --> 02:12:45.061
<v Speaker 8>he's saying that he wanted to do that to spread the wealth and encourage people</v>

4964
02:12:45.401 --> 02:12:48.640
<v Speaker 8>to promote the video because it would be financially profitable for them as</v>

4965
02:12:48.641 --> 02:12:49.240
<v Speaker 8>well,</v>

4966
02:12:49.240 --> 02:12:50.410
<v Speaker 8>which is actually admirable.</v>

4967
02:12:50.620 --> 02:12:51.220
<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>

4968
02:12:51.220 --> 02:12:52.480
<v Speaker 8>that's a cool way to do things.</v>

4969
02:12:52.600 --> 02:12:57.280
<v Speaker 8>If you decided to put a link on your site and you made $1,000 in a month off of</v>

4970
02:12:57.281 --> 02:12:57.671
<v Speaker 8>his video,</v>

4971
02:12:57.671 --> 02:12:58.720
<v Speaker 8>that's your money man.</v>

4972
02:12:58.840 --> 02:12:59.920
<v Speaker 8>And you helped him.</v>

4973
02:13:00.040 --> 02:13:00.701
<v Speaker 8>You helped him,</v>

4974
02:13:00.701 --> 02:13:01.481
<v Speaker 8>you got the video out,</v>

4975
02:13:01.481 --> 02:13:03.860
<v Speaker 8>which is what he wanted and you got to,</v>

4976
02:13:03.910 --> 02:13:04.743
<v Speaker 8>you got some money.</v>

4977
02:13:04.780 --> 02:13:06.190
<v Speaker 8>So nothing wrong with that.</v>

4978
02:13:06.220 --> 02:13:07.360
<v Speaker 8>It's not a pyramid scheme.</v>

4979
02:13:07.390 --> 02:13:11.110
<v Speaker 8>A real pyramid scheme is a lie because there's nothing of value.</v>

4980
02:13:11.560 --> 02:13:12.210
<v Speaker 8>But this isn't a,</v>

4981
02:13:12.210 --> 02:13:13.060
<v Speaker 8>this is a movie.</v>

4982
02:13:13.090 --> 02:13:13.923
<v Speaker 8>I know what you're saying.</v>

4983
02:13:14.830 --> 02:13:16.180
<v Speaker 8>This is an actual product.</v>

4984
02:13:16.240 --> 02:13:17.073
<v Speaker 8>What is the movie?</v>

4985
02:13:17.110 --> 02:13:18.520
<v Speaker 8>It's called serious.</v>

4986
02:13:18.580 --> 02:13:18.860
<v Speaker 8>It's,</v>

4987
02:13:18.860 --> 02:13:19.390
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

4988
02:13:19.390 --> 02:13:19.840
<v Speaker 8>his,</v>

4989
02:13:19.840 --> 02:13:21.490
<v Speaker 8>his whole thing is,</v>

4990
02:13:22.840 --> 02:13:23.860
<v Speaker 8>it's very sketch.</v>

4991
02:13:23.980 --> 02:13:24.610
<v Speaker 8>Okay.</v>

4992
02:13:24.610 --> 02:13:25.151
<v Speaker 8>And it's,</v>

4993
02:13:25.151 --> 02:13:25.510
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

4994
02:13:25.510 --> 02:13:25.721
<v Speaker 8>I,</v>

4995
02:13:25.721 --> 02:13:26.140
<v Speaker 8>I look,</v>

4996
02:13:26.140 --> 02:13:27.730
<v Speaker 8>I should say first of all,</v>

4997
02:13:27.850 --> 02:13:31.860
<v Speaker 8>that I don't disbelieve in aliens.</v>

4998
02:13:32.010 --> 02:13:35.160
<v Speaker 8>I don't disbelieve in the idea that we've been contacted before,</v>

4999
02:13:35.730 --> 02:13:40.730
<v Speaker 8>but I have never seen anything that was compelling to me as far as like visual</v>

5000
02:13:42.421 --> 02:13:43.110
<v Speaker 8>evidence.</v>

5001
02:13:43.110 --> 02:13:44.220
<v Speaker 8>As far as,</v>

5002
02:13:44.300 --> 02:13:45.490
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>

5003
02:13:45.930 --> 02:13:47.160
<v Speaker 8>eye witness testimony.</v>

5004
02:13:47.370 --> 02:13:52.370
<v Speaker 8>I've never seen anything compelling that made me 100% sure that that person had</v>

5005
02:13:53.851 --> 02:13:58.470
<v Speaker 8>seen something from another planet or that this video was something from another</v>

5006
02:13:58.471 --> 02:13:58.890
<v Speaker 8>planet.</v>

5007
02:13:58.890 --> 02:14:00.150
<v Speaker 8>I've seen some wild shit,</v>

5008
02:14:00.151 --> 02:14:02.520
<v Speaker 8>but I don't know exactly what it is and I'm not,</v>

5009
02:14:03.060 --> 02:14:07.590
<v Speaker 8>I'm not privy to all of the various pieces of information that go into,</v>

5010
02:14:08.220 --> 02:14:09.000
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

5011
02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:10.140
<v Speaker 8>whatever the fuck happened.</v>

5012
02:14:10.141 --> 02:14:12.660
<v Speaker 8>When we see a thing that's flying across the sky,</v>

5013
02:14:12.990 --> 02:14:14.190
<v Speaker 8>who knows what that is.</v>

5014
02:14:14.490 --> 02:14:15.450
<v Speaker 8>One of the things I asked him,</v>

5015
02:14:15.451 --> 02:14:15.691
<v Speaker 8>he said,</v>

5016
02:14:15.691 --> 02:14:16.650
<v Speaker 8>we have a photo of a,</v>

5017
02:14:16.651 --> 02:14:18.240
<v Speaker 8>of a being.</v>

5018
02:14:18.570 --> 02:14:19.770
<v Speaker 8>It's like it looks like a,</v>

5019
02:14:19.980 --> 02:14:21.330
<v Speaker 8>an ethereal being.</v>

5020
02:14:21.510 --> 02:14:21.930
<v Speaker 8>I go,</v>

5021
02:14:21.930 --> 02:14:22.980
<v Speaker 8>how do you know that's not a video?</v>

5022
02:14:22.981 --> 02:14:23.371
<v Speaker 8>Or if I go,</v>

5023
02:14:23.371 --> 02:14:24.240
<v Speaker 8>it's not an artifact.</v>

5024
02:14:24.300 --> 02:14:24.781
<v Speaker 8>Well how can you,</v>

5025
02:14:24.781 --> 02:14:25.110
<v Speaker 8>how you,</v>

5026
02:14:25.110 --> 02:14:26.700
<v Speaker 8>how the fuck could you possibly know?</v>

5027
02:14:26.880 --> 02:14:28.560
<v Speaker 8>Like there's a lot of artifacts.</v>

5028
02:14:28.610 --> 02:14:28.761
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5029
02:14:28.761 --> 02:14:30.620
<v Speaker 3>That hologram thing is talking about.</v>

5030
02:14:30.630 --> 02:14:30.891
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

5031
02:14:30.891 --> 02:14:31.701
<v Speaker 3>are you kidding me?</v>

5032
02:14:31.701 --> 02:14:33.950
<v Speaker 3>You're actually saying that's like a Hologram dude.</v>

5033
02:14:33.951 --> 02:14:35.680
<v Speaker 3>Or even at the photo</v>

5034
02:14:35.800 --> 02:14:37.760
<v Speaker 8>dimensional being looked at,</v>

5035
02:14:37.790 --> 02:14:40.450
<v Speaker 8>there's a lot of confirmation bias.</v>

5036
02:14:40.480 --> 02:14:40.840
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

5037
02:14:40.840 --> 02:14:43.750
<v Speaker 8>And the reality of the Ufo community,</v>

5038
02:14:43.751 --> 02:14:44.590
<v Speaker 8>and this is again,</v>

5039
02:14:44.591 --> 02:14:45.940
<v Speaker 8>this is not saying everyone,</v>

5040
02:14:45.941 --> 02:14:47.680
<v Speaker 8>and this is not saying that you are foes are fake,</v>

5041
02:14:47.950 --> 02:14:51.610
<v Speaker 8>but the reality of the Ufo community is that it's filled with Kooks.</v>

5042
02:14:51.940 --> 02:14:53.710
<v Speaker 8>Just like the psychic community.</v>

5043
02:14:53.860 --> 02:14:55.540
<v Speaker 8>Just like the big foot community,</v>

5044
02:14:55.660 --> 02:14:57.490
<v Speaker 8>just like the ghost community.</v>

5045
02:14:57.580 --> 02:14:59.140
<v Speaker 8>It doesn't mean that goats aren't real.</v>

5046
02:14:59.160 --> 02:15:00.550
<v Speaker 8>It doesn't mean big foot's not real.</v>

5047
02:15:00.640 --> 02:15:04.180
<v Speaker 8>But it means all a lot of those people are drawn to Kooky Shit.</v>

5048
02:15:04.350 --> 02:15:09.350
<v Speaker 3>And another thing isn't like DNA nowadays fast enough where you take a little</v>

5049
02:15:09.601 --> 02:15:11.010
<v Speaker 3>piece of that little alien dude,</v>

5050
02:15:11.370 --> 02:15:12.060
<v Speaker 3>you could just be like,</v>

5051
02:15:12.060 --> 02:15:12.391
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>

5052
02:15:12.391 --> 02:15:13.224
<v Speaker 3>it's a baby.</v>

5053
02:15:13.430 --> 02:15:14.390
<v Speaker 8>Well not only that,</v>

5054
02:15:14.420 --> 02:15:16.250
<v Speaker 8>did you know that that alien dude,</v>

5055
02:15:16.550 --> 02:15:20.510
<v Speaker 8>they found that fucking thing and like 2002 yeah,</v>

5056
02:15:20.720 --> 02:15:23.160
<v Speaker 8>they found that thing a long ass time ago</v>

5057
02:15:23.260 --> 02:15:25.840
<v Speaker 3>or at Michael's craft shop or would they find this thing?</v>

5058
02:15:25.900 --> 02:15:27.430
<v Speaker 3>They found it in the dirt somewhere.</v>

5059
02:15:27.450 --> 02:15:27.570
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5060
02:15:27.570 --> 02:15:28.900
<v Speaker 3>He didn't want to tell us where he found it.</v>

5061
02:15:28.930 --> 02:15:30.460
<v Speaker 3>He found it in a desert safe.</v>

5062
02:15:30.520 --> 02:15:32.050
<v Speaker 8>What do you said afterwards?</v>

5063
02:15:32.051 --> 02:15:33.160
<v Speaker 8>We're never supposed to repeat.</v>

5064
02:15:33.580 --> 02:15:34.413
<v Speaker 8>So be careful.</v>

5065
02:15:34.480 --> 02:15:34.960
<v Speaker 8>Oh yeah.</v>

5066
02:15:34.960 --> 02:15:37.270
<v Speaker 8>Cause he told us where it's being studied and shit.</v>

5067
02:15:37.930 --> 02:15:40.900
<v Speaker 8>But the bottom line is he set himself up.</v>

5068
02:15:40.930 --> 02:15:41.231
<v Speaker 8>Okay,</v>

5069
02:15:41.231 --> 02:15:41.741
<v Speaker 8>so here's,</v>

5070
02:15:41.741 --> 02:15:45.880
<v Speaker 8>here's either they do the genetic work and it really is being done.</v>

5071
02:15:45.910 --> 02:15:48.550
<v Speaker 8>That's High Level Ivy League school.</v>

5072
02:15:48.760 --> 02:15:53.560
<v Speaker 8>And we find out about it and we get like peer reviewed papers that are talking</v>

5073
02:15:53.561 --> 02:15:55.060
<v Speaker 8>about whatever the fuck this thing is.</v>

5074
02:15:55.330 --> 02:15:56.690
<v Speaker 8>Whether it's a dis,</v>

5075
02:15:57.160 --> 02:15:58.840
<v Speaker 8>like some sort of a fetus,</v>

5076
02:15:58.841 --> 02:16:01.650
<v Speaker 8>it's got birth defects and makes it look like that.</v>

5077
02:16:01.690 --> 02:16:06.670
<v Speaker 8>I mean who knows what the hell it is or completely artificial or you know,</v>

5078
02:16:06.730 --> 02:16:07.240
<v Speaker 8>whatever.</v>

5079
02:16:07.240 --> 02:16:09.640
<v Speaker 8>Well you know w if they actually run a test,</v>

5080
02:16:09.700 --> 02:16:14.590
<v Speaker 8>but to say that you did a test and to say you got results coming,</v>

5081
02:16:14.950 --> 02:16:17.110
<v Speaker 8>you'll set yourself up because it's one or the other.</v>

5082
02:16:17.111 --> 02:16:20.320
<v Speaker 8>Now it's either bullshit or it's something.</v>

5083
02:16:20.350 --> 02:16:20.800
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

5084
02:16:20.800 --> 02:16:22.060
<v Speaker 8>And if it's a rubber doll,</v>

5085
02:16:22.090 --> 02:16:23.290
<v Speaker 8>I'm going to be upset at you.</v>

5086
02:16:23.970 --> 02:16:24.561
<v Speaker 3>Of course.</v>

5087
02:16:24.561 --> 02:16:25.394
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5088
02:16:25.790 --> 02:16:27.170
<v Speaker 3>I think that's a test that it,</v>

5089
02:16:27.171 --> 02:16:28.160
<v Speaker 3>it's like a week,</v>

5090
02:16:28.220 --> 02:16:28.551
<v Speaker 3>a week.</v>

5091
02:16:28.551 --> 02:16:29.384
<v Speaker 3>DNA.</v>

5092
02:16:29.610 --> 02:16:30.480
<v Speaker 3>I think it takes that long.</v>

5093
02:16:30.481 --> 02:16:32.580
<v Speaker 3>Like if there's a fire in a car,</v>

5094
02:16:32.790 --> 02:16:33.750
<v Speaker 3>the police can go,</v>

5095
02:16:33.810 --> 02:16:34.201
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

5096
02:16:34.201 --> 02:16:37.530
<v Speaker 3>we found human remains cause we checked its DNA as human DNA.</v>

5097
02:16:37.590 --> 02:16:38.730
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that something fast?</v>

5098
02:16:40.320 --> 02:16:41.010
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

5099
02:16:41.010 --> 02:16:43.230
<v Speaker 3>How does he not know how to use a camera yet?</v>

5100
02:16:43.680 --> 02:16:43.950
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry.</v>

5101
02:16:43.950 --> 02:16:44.071
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

5102
02:16:44.071 --> 02:16:44.341
<v Speaker 3>let's,</v>

5103
02:16:44.341 --> 02:16:44.640
<v Speaker 3>let's,</v>

5104
02:16:44.640 --> 02:16:44.971
<v Speaker 3>let's,</v>

5105
02:16:44.971 --> 02:16:48.150
<v Speaker 3>let's Google the whole,</v>

5106
02:16:48.200 --> 02:16:51.060
<v Speaker 3>just a guest you had on the big foot thing.</v>

5107
02:16:51.390 --> 02:16:54.040
<v Speaker 3>He's the biggest big a phone.</v>

5108
02:16:56.010 --> 02:17:00.660
<v Speaker 8>Well he only saw two bone saw to Dr. Greer.</v>

5109
02:17:00.661 --> 02:17:00.991
<v Speaker 8>Hold on.</v>

5110
02:17:00.991 --> 02:17:01.950
<v Speaker 8>Dr. Greer,</v>

5111
02:17:02.390 --> 02:17:05.490
<v Speaker 8>ideally in a top sea.</v>

5112
02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:06.151
<v Speaker 8>Oh,</v>

5113
02:17:06.151 --> 02:17:07.490
<v Speaker 8>all of those are fucking bullshit.</v>

5114
02:17:08.320 --> 02:17:09.280
<v Speaker 8>The autopsy films.</v>

5115
02:17:10.870 --> 02:17:11.703
<v Speaker 8>Um,</v>

5116
02:17:12.540 --> 02:17:13.470
<v Speaker 8>Dr. Greer,</v>

5117
02:17:13.530 --> 02:17:14.580
<v Speaker 8>alien body.</v>

5118
02:17:15.690 --> 02:17:17.730
<v Speaker 8>I just don't like it if he is,</v>

5119
02:17:18.180 --> 02:17:19.150
<v Speaker 8>if he's a bullshitter,</v>

5120
02:17:19.590 --> 02:17:20.490
<v Speaker 8>bullshitting is,</v>

5121
02:17:20.491 --> 02:17:22.380
<v Speaker 8>I am going to send shit to his house.</v>

5122
02:17:22.410 --> 02:17:22.620
<v Speaker 8>Okay.</v>

5123
02:17:22.620 --> 02:17:23.453
<v Speaker 8>I'll just say this.</v>

5124
02:17:23.800 --> 02:17:28.560
<v Speaker 8>At least a small percentage of what he was saying smelled like bullshit.</v>

5125
02:17:28.860 --> 02:17:30.540
<v Speaker 8>The anecdotal stories,</v>

5126
02:17:30.600 --> 02:17:31.350
<v Speaker 8>the way they were,</v>

5127
02:17:31.350 --> 02:17:32.250
<v Speaker 8>they were coming out.</v>

5128
02:17:32.340 --> 02:17:33.450
<v Speaker 8>Somebody described them like,</v>

5129
02:17:33.451 --> 02:17:34.920
<v Speaker 8>like bad scenes in a movie.</v>

5130
02:17:35.130 --> 02:17:38.760
<v Speaker 8>Then he said this and I said that sometimes people just sort of paraphrase</v>

5131
02:17:38.761 --> 02:17:41.250
<v Speaker 8>though and that could be responding to me.</v>

5132
02:17:41.251 --> 02:17:44.160
<v Speaker 8>You're telling a story over and over and over again after a course of so many</v>

5133
02:17:44.161 --> 02:17:44.850
<v Speaker 8>years.</v>

5134
02:17:44.850 --> 02:17:48.150
<v Speaker 8>Sometimes people sort of paraphrase what actually was said and they put it into</v>

5135
02:17:48.151 --> 02:17:49.500
<v Speaker 8>almost like a script form.</v>

5136
02:17:49.740 --> 02:17:51.930
<v Speaker 8>And that could have been what that guy was doing.</v>

5137
02:17:51.931 --> 02:17:53.270
<v Speaker 8>Cause it did sound like fiction.</v>

5138
02:17:53.340 --> 02:17:53.611
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5139
02:17:53.611 --> 02:17:54.780
<v Speaker 3>It also sounded like,</v>

5140
02:17:54.810 --> 02:17:58.470
<v Speaker 3>I noticed that whenever you would ask him a question and that kind of throw them</v>

5141
02:17:58.471 --> 02:17:59.340
<v Speaker 3>off or whatever,</v>

5142
02:17:59.610 --> 02:18:02.590
<v Speaker 3>he would go into this weird voice where he just suddenly good.</v>

5143
02:18:03.200 --> 02:18:03.560
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5144
02:18:03.560 --> 02:18:07.280
<v Speaker 3>So like it got really quiet and calm like,</v>

5145
02:18:08.220 --> 02:18:08.750
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

5146
02:18:08.750 --> 02:18:09.510
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>

5147
02:18:09.510 --> 02:18:11.160
<v Speaker 3>Like his voice changed into this.</v>

5148
02:18:11.161 --> 02:18:13.140
<v Speaker 3>We're really weird volume.</v>

5149
02:18:13.190 --> 02:18:13.670
<v Speaker 3>It just went.</v>

5150
02:18:13.670 --> 02:18:14.451
<v Speaker 8>Those were three of us.</v>

5151
02:18:14.451 --> 02:18:17.450
<v Speaker 8>They think they have an alien body or that thing.</v>

5152
02:18:18.230 --> 02:18:19.063
<v Speaker 8>What do you think that is?</v>

5153
02:18:19.580 --> 02:18:21.480
<v Speaker 8>I think that's a very old human body.</v>

5154
02:18:21.481 --> 02:18:22.430
<v Speaker 8>Six inches long.</v>

5155
02:18:23.300 --> 02:18:26.480
<v Speaker 8>But they have a math and a ruler next to it and everything,</v>

5156
02:18:26.510 --> 02:18:29.340
<v Speaker 8>but couldn't that be from it's fuck.</v>

5157
02:18:29.390 --> 02:18:33.780
<v Speaker 8>Of course it could be a child or it could be so old that it's like when the,</v>

5158
02:18:33.800 --> 02:18:34.633
<v Speaker 8>but he doesn't know.</v>

5159
02:18:34.940 --> 02:18:35.690
<v Speaker 8>He said,</v>

5160
02:18:35.690 --> 02:18:38.720
<v Speaker 8>I mean in his defense he said he doesn't know what it is and he said they're</v>

5161
02:18:38.721 --> 02:18:39.680
<v Speaker 8>doing tests on it.</v>

5162
02:18:39.850 --> 02:18:40.140
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

5163
02:18:40.140 --> 02:18:41.810
<v Speaker 8>but if he found it that long ago,</v>

5164
02:18:42.320 --> 02:18:44.240
<v Speaker 8>I don't know when he got ahold of it though.</v>

5165
02:18:44.570 --> 02:18:45.291
<v Speaker 8>He told us,</v>

5166
02:18:45.291 --> 02:18:46.160
<v Speaker 8>I don't remember.</v>

5167
02:18:46.220 --> 02:18:47.900
<v Speaker 8>It was a long conversation and we talked,</v>

5168
02:18:47.930 --> 02:18:49.460
<v Speaker 8>we talked to the guy for three hours.</v>

5169
02:18:49.650 --> 02:18:50.210
<v Speaker 8>It's going to be,</v>

5170
02:18:50.210 --> 02:18:50.870
<v Speaker 8>hey guys.</v>

5171
02:18:50.870 --> 02:18:51.021
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

5172
02:18:51.021 --> 02:18:51.400
<v Speaker 8>we ran,</v>

5173
02:18:51.400 --> 02:18:56.400
<v Speaker 8>says it was a guy years ago in January of 2013 and it says that the studies will</v>

5174
02:18:59.451 --> 02:19:00.740
<v Speaker 8>take around two months,</v>

5175
02:19:00.800 --> 02:19:01.730
<v Speaker 8>possibly longer.</v>

5176
02:19:01.790 --> 02:19:04.790
<v Speaker 8>So they just started the testing in January.</v>

5177
02:19:04.820 --> 02:19:06.130
<v Speaker 8>So that's why they haven't gotten these,</v>

5178
02:19:06.140 --> 02:19:06.951
<v Speaker 8>doing these testing.</v>

5179
02:19:06.951 --> 02:19:07.784
<v Speaker 8>Mcafee,</v>

5180
02:19:08.270 --> 02:19:08.991
<v Speaker 8>McAfee,</v>

5181
02:19:08.991 --> 02:19:10.120
<v Speaker 8>what happened at McAfee?</v>

5182
02:19:10.121 --> 02:19:10.490
<v Speaker 8>Mcafee,</v>

5183
02:19:10.490 --> 02:19:11.270
<v Speaker 8>he's balling.</v>

5184
02:19:11.270 --> 02:19:14.730
<v Speaker 8>He's in a Texas trying to sell his house and believes dude,</v>

5185
02:19:15.170 --> 02:19:15.591
<v Speaker 8>dude,</v>

5186
02:19:15.591 --> 02:19:16.110
<v Speaker 8>dude,</v>

5187
02:19:16.110 --> 02:19:16.943
<v Speaker 8>dude.</v>

5188
02:19:18.020 --> 02:19:18.231
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

5189
02:19:18.231 --> 02:19:21.880
<v Speaker 8>he's got his 20 year old Third World Hottie with them just getting this freak.</v>

5190
02:19:21.881 --> 02:19:22.670
<v Speaker 8>Huh.</v>

5191
02:19:22.670 --> 02:19:23.503
<v Speaker 8>Good for him.</v>

5192
02:19:24.130 --> 02:19:24.770
<v Speaker 8>Um,</v>

5193
02:19:24.770 --> 02:19:25.603
<v Speaker 8>yeah.</v>

5194
02:19:26.330 --> 02:19:27.163
<v Speaker 8>I don't know man.</v>

5195
02:19:27.170 --> 02:19:28.003
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>

5196
02:19:28.240 --> 02:19:29.890
<v Speaker 8>if he really did find an alien,</v>

5197
02:19:29.910 --> 02:19:30.890
<v Speaker 8>like Holy Shit.</v>

5198
02:19:31.220 --> 02:19:32.870
<v Speaker 8>I mean maybe can you imagine?</v>

5199
02:19:32.890 --> 02:19:35.600
<v Speaker 8>That would be really fascinating and ironic if there was a guy who was a</v>

5200
02:19:35.630 --> 02:19:36.960
<v Speaker 8>charlatan who was a,</v>

5201
02:19:36.961 --> 02:19:39.470
<v Speaker 8>a total UFO hoaxer but somebody gave him a real alien.</v>

5202
02:19:41.150 --> 02:19:41.481
<v Speaker 8>You know?</v>

5203
02:19:41.481 --> 02:19:43.130
<v Speaker 8>And I'm not saying that Greer is a charlatan.</v>

5204
02:19:43.131 --> 02:19:43.964
<v Speaker 8>I don't think he is.</v>

5205
02:19:44.240 --> 02:19:44.751
<v Speaker 8>I think,</v>

5206
02:19:44.751 --> 02:19:45.690
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>

5207
02:19:46.340 --> 02:19:49.610
<v Speaker 8>first of all he's dealing with a really nutty group of humans,</v>

5208
02:19:49.840 --> 02:19:50.990
<v Speaker 8>the Ufo community.</v>

5209
02:19:51.020 --> 02:19:51.970
<v Speaker 8>And I think if that's your,</v>

5210
02:19:52.130 --> 02:19:56.240
<v Speaker 8>your base and that you're communicating with them only for decade after decade.</v>

5211
02:19:56.270 --> 02:20:01.270
<v Speaker 8>And most of this was sort of instigated on your part before the Internet.</v>

5212
02:20:02.601 --> 02:20:05.630
<v Speaker 8>So he was involved in like the Ufo community before,</v>

5213
02:20:05.650 --> 02:20:06.140
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

5214
02:20:06.140 --> 02:20:08.330
<v Speaker 8>people were even online a lot before Twitter,</v>

5215
02:20:08.540 --> 02:20:09.830
<v Speaker 8>before you in my space.</v>

5216
02:20:10.160 --> 02:20:11.420
<v Speaker 8>Like he was online,</v>

5217
02:20:11.450 --> 02:20:11.781
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

5218
02:20:11.781 --> 02:20:11.990
<v Speaker 8>like,</v>

5219
02:20:11.990 --> 02:20:16.990
<v Speaker 8>and he was known through the world from these youtube clips and shit like that.</v>

5220
02:20:17.630 --> 02:20:18.291
<v Speaker 8>He was already,</v>

5221
02:20:18.291 --> 02:20:18.801
<v Speaker 8>before that,</v>

5222
02:20:18.801 --> 02:20:21.170
<v Speaker 8>it had been long before the disclosure project,</v>

5223
02:20:21.171 --> 02:20:22.880
<v Speaker 8>he had put that together for years.</v>

5224
02:20:23.270 --> 02:20:24.570
<v Speaker 8>So he had always been involved.</v>

5225
02:20:24.590 --> 02:20:25.490
<v Speaker 8>All these nutty people.</v>

5226
02:20:25.520 --> 02:20:26.090
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

5227
02:20:26.090 --> 02:20:27.710
<v Speaker 8>And when you're involved with nutty people,</v>

5228
02:20:27.711 --> 02:20:30.350
<v Speaker 8>especially the nutty Ufo people before the Internet,</v>

5229
02:20:30.351 --> 02:20:32.090
<v Speaker 8>like you got a lot of adjusting to do.</v>

5230
02:20:32.360 --> 02:20:32.861
<v Speaker 8>Once the,</v>

5231
02:20:32.861 --> 02:20:33.051
<v Speaker 8>the,</v>

5232
02:20:33.051 --> 02:20:33.331
<v Speaker 8>the,</v>

5233
02:20:33.331 --> 02:20:38.060
<v Speaker 8>the Thor Hammer of reality comes down and sometimes guys adjust really poorly.</v>

5234
02:20:38.300 --> 02:20:40.220
<v Speaker 8>So they still have a lot of bullshit in their game.</v>

5235
02:20:40.460 --> 02:20:40.761
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>

5236
02:20:40.761 --> 02:20:45.761
<v Speaker 8>they might have a few things that are real that they're investigating that are</v>

5237
02:20:46.071 --> 02:20:48.320
<v Speaker 8>beyond understanding there.</v>

5238
02:20:48.350 --> 02:20:49.460
<v Speaker 8>It's very possible.</v>

5239
02:20:49.610 --> 02:20:52.430
<v Speaker 8>But there also might be some fuckery mixed in there too.</v>

5240
02:20:52.431 --> 02:20:53.840
<v Speaker 8>And Leo Fuckery,</v>

5241
02:20:54.200 --> 02:20:55.070
<v Speaker 8>serious writers.</v>

5242
02:20:55.220 --> 02:20:56.420
<v Speaker 8>And you've gotta be real careful.</v>

5243
02:20:56.421 --> 02:20:58.790
<v Speaker 8>And one of the things is he's,</v>

5244
02:20:58.791 --> 02:20:59.330
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

5245
02:20:59.330 --> 02:21:01.610
<v Speaker 8>somehow or another he's drawing an income from all of this.</v>

5246
02:21:02.230 --> 02:21:03.920
<v Speaker 8>He wasn't really that open about it,</v>

5247
02:21:03.921 --> 02:21:07.910
<v Speaker 8>but I know that he takes people out into the desert and gives them an alien</v>

5248
02:21:07.911 --> 02:21:10.370
<v Speaker 8>encounters and shit and they charges money for that.</v>

5249
02:21:10.400 --> 02:21:10.971
<v Speaker 8>Of course.</v>

5250
02:21:10.971 --> 02:21:11.150
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

5251
02:21:11.150 --> 02:21:14.390
<v Speaker 8>And it's like several days and you'd take a bunch of people out there and you</v>

5252
02:21:14.391 --> 02:21:14.930
<v Speaker 8>know,</v>

5253
02:21:14.930 --> 02:21:15.950
<v Speaker 8>make some cash,</v>

5254
02:21:18.230 --> 02:21:21.830
<v Speaker 8>some shit in the sky almost makes me want to say that you shouldn't even bother</v>

5255
02:21:21.831 --> 02:21:22.760
<v Speaker 8>dealing with this one.</v>

5256
02:21:23.330 --> 02:21:24.250
<v Speaker 8>It's so obvious.</v>

5257
02:21:24.350 --> 02:21:24.531
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>

5258
02:21:24.531 --> 02:21:24.681
<v Speaker 8>no,</v>

5259
02:21:24.681 --> 02:21:24.861
<v Speaker 8>no,</v>

5260
02:21:24.861 --> 02:21:25.010
<v Speaker 8>no,</v>

5261
02:21:25.010 --> 02:21:25.220
<v Speaker 8>no.</v>

5262
02:21:25.220 --> 02:21:26.053
<v Speaker 8>It's both.</v>

5263
02:21:26.210 --> 02:21:27.140
<v Speaker 8>It's fascinating.</v>

5264
02:21:27.170 --> 02:21:27.711
<v Speaker 8>He's a,</v>

5265
02:21:27.711 --> 02:21:31.910
<v Speaker 8>he's a certainly marketing himself and he certainly brought up his site a lot,</v>

5266
02:21:32.180 --> 02:21:33.050
<v Speaker 8>but it's also,</v>

5267
02:21:33.920 --> 02:21:34.880
<v Speaker 8>here's the question,</v>

5268
02:21:35.450 --> 02:21:40.450
<v Speaker 8>what would you do if you knew that there really was some sort of encounter with</v>

5269
02:21:43.791 --> 02:21:45.110
<v Speaker 8>humans and aliens?</v>

5270
02:21:45.110 --> 02:21:49.010
<v Speaker 8>If you knew that there had been a series of events that had been swept under the</v>

5271
02:21:49.011 --> 02:21:54.011
<v Speaker 8>rug and covered up and you start making a living doing something different,</v>

5272
02:21:55.190 --> 02:21:59.240
<v Speaker 8>but this fascination with Ufo gets in the way and then all of a sudden you have</v>

5273
02:21:59.241 --> 02:22:02.720
<v Speaker 8>to quit your job and then as you're quitting your job for something that you</v>

5274
02:22:02.721 --> 02:22:03.590
<v Speaker 8>absolutely believe in,</v>

5275
02:22:03.591 --> 02:22:06.170
<v Speaker 8>but it's totally ridiculed by everyone around you,</v>

5276
02:22:06.500 --> 02:22:11.320
<v Speaker 8>then what if you have to figure out how to make a living off of this thing that</v>

5277
02:22:11.321 --> 02:22:11.670
<v Speaker 8>you built?</v>

5278
02:22:11.670 --> 02:22:15.390
<v Speaker 8>So maybe it's that maybe the guy's legit and may,</v>

5279
02:22:15.391 --> 02:22:16.230
<v Speaker 8>but it's this,</v>

5280
02:22:16.460 --> 02:22:19.040
<v Speaker 8>this trying to profit off of it,</v>

5281
02:22:19.041 --> 02:22:22.270
<v Speaker 8>which gets people to go ahead and what's your motive?</v>

5282
02:22:22.340 --> 02:22:22.671
<v Speaker 8>Hey,</v>

5283
02:22:22.671 --> 02:22:24.140
<v Speaker 8>how can I got to pay you to go to the desert?</v>

5284
02:22:24.290 --> 02:22:25.123
<v Speaker 8>Hey,</v>

5285
02:22:25.140 --> 02:22:27.120
<v Speaker 8>you do with all the money that he got from his donated movie.</v>

5286
02:22:27.120 --> 02:22:27.810
<v Speaker 8>Hey,</v>

5287
02:22:27.810 --> 02:22:29.130
<v Speaker 8>how much did you claim on your taxes?</v>

5288
02:22:29.131 --> 02:22:29.880
<v Speaker 8>Where'd you get that money?</v>

5289
02:22:29.880 --> 02:22:30.151
<v Speaker 8>Where's it?</v>

5290
02:22:30.151 --> 02:22:30.871
<v Speaker 8>Where's it coming from?</v>

5291
02:22:30.871 --> 02:22:31.501
<v Speaker 8>You writing books,</v>

5292
02:22:31.501 --> 02:22:32.161
<v Speaker 8>you're selling the books,</v>

5293
02:22:32.161 --> 02:22:32.821
<v Speaker 8>you're doing lectures,</v>

5294
02:22:32.821 --> 02:22:33.654
<v Speaker 8>you're doing this,</v>

5295
02:22:33.720 --> 02:22:34.890
<v Speaker 8>you're taking people out in the desert.</v>

5296
02:22:34.891 --> 02:22:35.550
<v Speaker 8>You're profiting,</v>

5297
02:22:35.550 --> 02:22:36.090
<v Speaker 8>okay?</v>

5298
02:22:36.090 --> 02:22:36.361
<v Speaker 8>It's,</v>

5299
02:22:36.361 --> 02:22:37.770
<v Speaker 8>this is obviously how you make your living.</v>

5300
02:22:37.771 --> 02:22:38.010
<v Speaker 8>Now,</v>

5301
02:22:38.010 --> 02:22:39.510
<v Speaker 8>not that there's anything wrong with that,</v>

5302
02:22:39.660 --> 02:22:40.980
<v Speaker 8>if he's legit,</v>

5303
02:22:41.250 --> 02:22:42.360
<v Speaker 8>if he's sincere,</v>

5304
02:22:42.480 --> 02:22:44.490
<v Speaker 8>but when you have those elements,</v>

5305
02:22:44.520 --> 02:22:48.900
<v Speaker 8>people automatically get skeptical and then there's the part of like</v>

5306
02:22:49.230 --> 02:22:54.230
<v Speaker 8>extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence and when you're claiming</v>

5307
02:22:55.260 --> 02:22:56.310
<v Speaker 8>crazy shit,</v>

5308
02:22:56.430 --> 02:23:00.540
<v Speaker 8>you should have photos and video ready to go at the drop of a hat.</v>

5309
02:23:00.900 --> 02:23:03.450
<v Speaker 8>And when I was questioning him about where can I see these photos?</v>

5310
02:23:03.451 --> 02:23:05.640
<v Speaker 8>Like if you have photos you shouldn't.</v>

5311
02:23:05.641 --> 02:23:06.001
<v Speaker 8>First of all,</v>

5312
02:23:06.001 --> 02:23:09.780
<v Speaker 8>if you have something that's really important for people to see and you are a</v>

5313
02:23:09.781 --> 02:23:13.830
<v Speaker 8>researcher and your whole Gig is about trying to get the truth out,</v>

5314
02:23:13.940 --> 02:23:16.530
<v Speaker 8>you would put that shit online the moment you got it right,</v>

5315
02:23:16.600 --> 02:23:18.120
<v Speaker 8>he would make sure it goes viral.</v>

5316
02:23:18.240 --> 02:23:21.450
<v Speaker 8>If you're holding it back and only putting it in your documentary,</v>

5317
02:23:23.070 --> 02:23:23.641
<v Speaker 8>I got to go,</v>

5318
02:23:23.641 --> 02:23:24.140
<v Speaker 8>all right.</v>

5319
02:23:24.140 --> 02:23:24.870
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

5320
02:23:24.870 --> 02:23:25.660
<v Speaker 8>Okay.</v>

5321
02:23:25.660 --> 02:23:25.931
<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>

5322
02:23:25.931 --> 02:23:27.000
<v Speaker 8>I see you trying to make some money,</v>

5323
02:23:27.001 --> 02:23:30.920
<v Speaker 8>but what you're doing is contrary to the,</v>

5324
02:23:30.950 --> 02:23:31.111
<v Speaker 8>the,</v>

5325
02:23:31.111 --> 02:23:33.060
<v Speaker 8>the path that you need to follow to be taken</v>

5326
02:23:33.070 --> 02:23:33.700
<v Speaker 4>and serious,</v>

5327
02:23:33.700 --> 02:23:38.110
<v Speaker 4>especially a scientific path because somebody that wants to tell you the truth</v>

5328
02:23:38.140 --> 02:23:38.890
<v Speaker 4>about,</v>

5329
02:23:38.890 --> 02:23:39.310
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

5330
02:23:39.310 --> 02:23:39.641
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5331
02:23:39.641 --> 02:23:43.240
<v Speaker 4>a huge something that would have that type of impact on the world and the way it</v>

5332
02:23:43.241 --> 02:23:44.074
<v Speaker 4>operates.</v>

5333
02:23:44.190 --> 02:23:45.260
<v Speaker 4>You don't go as,</v>

5334
02:23:45.310 --> 02:23:48.340
<v Speaker 4>as somebody that's pursued this for my whole life,</v>

5335
02:23:48.341 --> 02:23:49.174
<v Speaker 4>I have the answer.</v>

5336
02:23:50.080 --> 02:23:52.340
<v Speaker 4>I want you to give me five bucks first before I tell you about it.</v>

5337
02:23:53.030 --> 02:23:53.530
<v Speaker 8>B,</v>

5338
02:23:53.530 --> 02:23:53.961
<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>

5339
02:23:53.961 --> 02:23:54.351
<v Speaker 8>again,</v>

5340
02:23:54.351 --> 02:23:55.220
<v Speaker 8>I have to be fair.</v>

5341
02:23:55.250 --> 02:23:58.340
<v Speaker 8>It also could be that he doesn't understand how he's coming off.</v>

5342
02:23:58.640 --> 02:24:00.070
<v Speaker 8>It also could be true that,</v>

5343
02:24:00.071 --> 02:24:00.321
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

5344
02:24:00.321 --> 02:24:02.660
<v Speaker 8>he really truly has had these experiences,</v>

5345
02:24:02.661 --> 02:24:05.750
<v Speaker 8>but now he's in a scramble to try to figure out how to make some money off of</v>

5346
02:24:05.751 --> 02:24:06.320
<v Speaker 8>it.</v>

5347
02:24:06.320 --> 02:24:11.120
<v Speaker 8>There's a fascinating website that details Hillary Clinton's meetings with the</v>

5348
02:24:11.121 --> 02:24:12.170
<v Speaker 8>Rockefeller family.</v>

5349
02:24:13.130 --> 02:24:13.963
<v Speaker 8>It's really crazy.</v>

5350
02:24:14.120 --> 02:24:15.350
<v Speaker 8>And one of the photos,</v>

5351
02:24:15.470 --> 02:24:16.221
<v Speaker 8>Hillary Clinton,</v>

5352
02:24:16.221 --> 02:24:21.221
<v Speaker 8>it's walking and she's got this book with her and people tried to figure out</v>

5353
02:24:21.471 --> 02:24:23.060
<v Speaker 8>what book it was like they're there.</v>

5354
02:24:23.080 --> 02:24:28.080
<v Speaker 8>They did a close up of the image and it's a book on extraterrestrial encounters</v>

5355
02:24:28.970 --> 02:24:29.381
<v Speaker 8>and art.</v>

5356
02:24:29.381 --> 02:24:29.841
<v Speaker 8>It's about,</v>

5357
02:24:29.841 --> 02:24:31.490
<v Speaker 8>are we alone in the universe?</v>

5358
02:24:31.850 --> 02:24:36.350
<v Speaker 8>And the book is all about like what we would do if we got contacted by an alien</v>

5359
02:24:36.351 --> 02:24:39.650
<v Speaker 8>race and she's walking with Rockefeller who had given her that book.</v>

5360
02:24:39.800 --> 02:24:40.280
<v Speaker 8>Really?</v>

5361
02:24:40.280 --> 02:24:40.670
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

5362
02:24:40.670 --> 02:24:43.970
<v Speaker 8>So she's walking along in his ranch in Wyoming.</v>

5363
02:24:43.971 --> 02:24:46.580
<v Speaker 8>He's worth about a fucking billion,</v>

5364
02:24:46.580 --> 02:24:46.581
<v Speaker 8>trillion dollars.</v>

5365
02:24:46.581 --> 02:24:48.410
<v Speaker 8>He's at the top of the financial food chain.</v>

5366
02:24:48.620 --> 02:24:51.650
<v Speaker 8>And he's exactly the person that this guy,</v>

5367
02:24:51.651 --> 02:24:55.430
<v Speaker 8>Dr. Steven Greer was telling us we'd have access to this kind of information and</v>

5368
02:24:55.431 --> 02:24:56.870
<v Speaker 8>would want to,</v>

5369
02:24:56.871 --> 02:24:57.230
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

5370
02:24:57.230 --> 02:24:57.531
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

5371
02:24:57.531 --> 02:24:59.120
<v Speaker 8>figure out what we do.</v>

5372
02:24:59.360 --> 02:24:59.601
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>

5373
02:24:59.601 --> 02:25:01.310
<v Speaker 8>what do we do about the banking system,</v>

5374
02:25:01.320 --> 02:25:02.480
<v Speaker 8>what we do about the military.</v>

5375
02:25:02.481 --> 02:25:03.350
<v Speaker 8>So what do we do when,</v>

5376
02:25:03.380 --> 02:25:03.710
<v Speaker 8>if,</v>

5377
02:25:03.710 --> 02:25:05.990
<v Speaker 8>when and if aliens do come.</v>

5378
02:25:06.290 --> 02:25:09.280
<v Speaker 8>And so he's walking around and meeting a woman who ran for president.</v>

5379
02:25:09.281 --> 02:25:12.440
<v Speaker 8>It was the wife of the president of the secretary of state and then wandering</v>

5380
02:25:12.441 --> 02:25:15.020
<v Speaker 8>around is fucking a ranch and she's got an alien book in her hand,</v>

5381
02:25:15.080 --> 02:25:15.913
<v Speaker 8>but he gave her,</v>

5382
02:25:16.540 --> 02:25:17.630
<v Speaker 4>now that was that photo.</v>

5383
02:25:17.640 --> 02:25:18.850
<v Speaker 4>The original photo was,</v>

5384
02:25:18.860 --> 02:25:19.221
<v Speaker 4>good question.</v>

5385
02:25:19.221 --> 02:25:19.531
<v Speaker 4>Is it,</v>

5386
02:25:19.531 --> 02:25:21.200
<v Speaker 4>is it published anywhere?</v>

5387
02:25:21.230 --> 02:25:22.100
<v Speaker 4>Respectable,</v>

5388
02:25:22.130 --> 02:25:22.371
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5389
02:25:22.371 --> 02:25:22.521
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

5390
02:25:22.521 --> 02:25:23.040
<v Speaker 4>cause that's,</v>

5391
02:25:23.040 --> 02:25:23.460
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

5392
02:25:23.460 --> 02:25:23.770
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>

5393
02:25:23.770 --> 02:25:24.060
<v Speaker 4>Seems</v>

5394
02:25:24.060 --> 02:25:24.990
<v Speaker 3>like a very good question.</v>

5395
02:25:24.991 --> 02:25:26.250
<v Speaker 3>Usually photo.</v>

5396
02:25:26.340 --> 02:25:27.151
<v Speaker 3>You're very good question.</v>

5397
02:25:27.151 --> 02:25:27.481
<v Speaker 3>So let's,</v>

5398
02:25:27.481 --> 02:25:27.870
<v Speaker 3>let's,</v>

5399
02:25:27.870 --> 02:25:28.260
<v Speaker 3>let's,</v>

5400
02:25:28.260 --> 02:25:33.260
<v Speaker 3>let's search for the hoax Hillary Clinton and everything you could do is take</v>

5401
02:25:33.841 --> 02:25:38.160
<v Speaker 3>the Hillary Clinton photo and save it to your desktop and then Google image</v>

5402
02:25:38.161 --> 02:25:42.270
<v Speaker 3>search it and find that similar images and see if they all have that because</v>

5403
02:25:42.330 --> 02:25:45.690
<v Speaker 3>somebody has made that a twilight book cover for sure.</v>

5404
02:25:45.990 --> 02:25:46.261
<v Speaker 8>Okay.</v>

5405
02:25:46.261 --> 02:25:49.500
<v Speaker 8>Let's see if it's Hillary Clinton Rockefeller alien book,</v>

5406
02:25:49.650 --> 02:25:50.610
<v Speaker 8>shades of grey,</v>

5407
02:25:51.810 --> 02:25:52.760
<v Speaker 8>50 shades of grey.</v>

5408
02:25:53.780 --> 02:25:54.613
<v Speaker 8>Mm.</v>

5409
02:25:54.990 --> 02:25:55.800
<v Speaker 8>Well there's a,</v>

5410
02:25:55.800 --> 02:25:57.930
<v Speaker 8>there's also some documents about,</v>

5411
02:25:57.960 --> 02:25:58.793
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>

5412
02:25:59.100 --> 02:25:59.581
<v Speaker 8>about,</v>

5413
02:25:59.581 --> 02:25:59.880
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

5414
02:25:59.880 --> 02:26:04.410
<v Speaker 8>Rockefeller wanting to talk President Clinton into,</v>

5415
02:26:04.411 --> 02:26:07.680
<v Speaker 8>these were released by the freedom of Information Act that Rockefeller was</v>

5416
02:26:07.830 --> 02:26:10.320
<v Speaker 8>trying to talk President Clinton into,</v>

5417
02:26:10.321 --> 02:26:11.154
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>

5418
02:26:11.430 --> 02:26:11.881
<v Speaker 8>into,</v>

5419
02:26:11.881 --> 02:26:12.240
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

5420
02:26:12.240 --> 02:26:13.950
<v Speaker 8>releasing information about aliens.</v>

5421
02:26:14.580 --> 02:26:15.000
<v Speaker 8>Oh really?</v>

5422
02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:15.390
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

5423
02:26:15.390 --> 02:26:18.420
<v Speaker 8>And the Rockefeller was requesting information and they wouldn't give it to him.</v>

5424
02:26:18.600 --> 02:26:20.160
<v Speaker 8>And he had a meeting with Clinton.</v>

5425
02:26:21.090 --> 02:26:21.301
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

5426
02:26:21.301 --> 02:26:22.620
<v Speaker 8>It's just a pretty trippy man.</v>

5427
02:26:22.860 --> 02:26:26.200
<v Speaker 8>The book Laurance Rockefeller apparently was fascinated with [inaudible].</v>

5428
02:26:27.480 --> 02:26:27.931
<v Speaker 8>He was,</v>

5429
02:26:27.931 --> 02:26:28.764
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

5430
02:26:28.860 --> 02:26:29.700
<v Speaker 8>the dude was,</v>

5431
02:26:29.820 --> 02:26:30.780
<v Speaker 8>he was obsessed.</v>

5432
02:26:31.530 --> 02:26:31.741
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5433
02:26:31.741 --> 02:26:32.431
<v Speaker 3>Maybe he's just like,</v>

5434
02:26:32.431 --> 02:26:32.820
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5435
02:26:32.820 --> 02:26:33.630
<v Speaker 3>just like you,</v>

5436
02:26:33.630 --> 02:26:36.480
<v Speaker 3>maybe just a little guy that likes aliens and conspiracies.</v>

5437
02:26:36.481 --> 02:26:36.800
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5438
02:26:36.800 --> 02:26:38.310
<v Speaker 3>It could be just that's it.</v>

5439
02:26:38.370 --> 02:26:39.480
<v Speaker 3>That's how simple it is,</v>

5440
02:26:39.481 --> 02:26:39.990
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5441
02:26:39.990 --> 02:26:44.850
<v Speaker 3>except he could actually call the government asked for cash or asked to,</v>

5442
02:26:44.851 --> 02:26:45.330
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

5443
02:26:45.330 --> 02:26:46.740
<v Speaker 3>to give them cash for things.</v>

5444
02:26:47.310 --> 02:26:49.490
<v Speaker 8>You mean he like established funds and shit.</v>

5445
02:26:49.970 --> 02:26:50.121
<v Speaker 8>He,</v>

5446
02:26:50.121 --> 02:26:51.740
<v Speaker 8>along with his niece and Bartley,</v>

5447
02:26:51.741 --> 02:26:56.270
<v Speaker 8>the stepdaughter of Winthrop Rockefeller and the then president of the</v>

5448
02:26:56.270 --> 02:26:56.390
<v Speaker 8>Rockefeller Family Fund,</v>

5449
02:26:56.390 --> 02:27:00.860
<v Speaker 8>he established the Ufo disclosure initiative to the Clinton White House.</v>

5450
02:27:00.950 --> 02:27:03.800
<v Speaker 8>They asked for all UFO information held by the government,</v>

5451
02:27:03.801 --> 02:27:08.030
<v Speaker 8>including from the CIA and the u s air force to be declassified and released to</v>

5452
02:27:08.031 --> 02:27:08.864
<v Speaker 8>the public.</v>

5453
02:27:08.990 --> 02:27:13.520
<v Speaker 8>The first and most important test case where declassification had to apply</v>

5454
02:27:13.521 --> 02:27:16.730
<v Speaker 8>according to Rockefeller was the Roswell Ufo incident.</v>

5455
02:27:16.850 --> 02:27:17.810
<v Speaker 8>This is fascinating.</v>

5456
02:27:17.960 --> 02:27:19.340
<v Speaker 8>Like why,</v>

5457
02:27:20.210 --> 02:27:20.751
<v Speaker 8>why didn't,</v>

5458
02:27:20.751 --> 02:27:21.230
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>

5459
02:27:21.230 --> 02:27:22.550
<v Speaker 8>Greer talk about this,</v>

5460
02:27:22.700 --> 02:27:23.900
<v Speaker 8>why doesn't he know about this?</v>

5461
02:27:24.010 --> 02:27:24.681
<v Speaker 8>Cause this is all,</v>

5462
02:27:24.681 --> 02:27:27.470
<v Speaker 8>these are all government freedom of information documents.</v>

5463
02:27:28.520 --> 02:27:31.280
<v Speaker 8>It seems like something you would be into if you were dedicated to the cause.</v>

5464
02:27:31.370 --> 02:27:31.581
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

5465
02:27:31.581 --> 02:27:35.150
<v Speaker 8>it was in 1995 the Clintons went to a talk to the Rockefellers.</v>

5466
02:27:35.360 --> 02:27:37.030
<v Speaker 8>It was when Hilary was,</v>

5467
02:27:37.031 --> 02:27:37.640
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

5468
02:27:37.640 --> 02:27:41.600
<v Speaker 8>married to bill and bill was the president and a mother fucker gave her a book</v>

5469
02:27:41.601 --> 02:27:42.434
<v Speaker 8>on aliens.</v>

5470
02:27:42.590 --> 02:27:43.460
<v Speaker 8>Come walk with me.</v>

5471
02:27:43.580 --> 02:27:44.150
<v Speaker 8>Let's talk.</v>

5472
02:27:44.150 --> 02:27:45.250
<v Speaker 8>I want to talk to about something from,</v>

5473
02:27:45.260 --> 02:27:49.430
<v Speaker 8>talk to you about some real shit and tell your daddy go home and tell Daddy.</v>

5477
02:27:54.741 --> 02:27:57.010
<v Speaker 8>I want to know what's up everyday.</v>

5478
02:27:57.050 --> 02:27:58.790
<v Speaker 8>I get to say that my dad is Dansk.</v>

5479
02:27:59.540 --> 02:28:00.373
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

5480
02:28:01.430 --> 02:28:04.040
<v Speaker 8>Creepy old fuck knows so fucking creepy.</v>

5481
02:28:04.250 --> 02:28:05.720
<v Speaker 8>And Bill Clinton apparently couldn't,</v>

5482
02:28:05.770 --> 02:28:06.080
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

5483
02:28:06.080 --> 02:28:09.200
<v Speaker 8>according to a Rockefeller or according to,</v>

5484
02:28:09.201 --> 02:28:10.034
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>

5485
02:28:10.290 --> 02:28:10.940
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>

5486
02:28:10.940 --> 02:28:12.170
<v Speaker 8>the people talked about this,</v>

5487
02:28:12.171 --> 02:28:13.040
<v Speaker 8>Bill Clinton couldn't,</v>

5488
02:28:13.100 --> 02:28:14.420
<v Speaker 8>couldn't get any information out of him.</v>

5489
02:28:14.660 --> 02:28:16.880
<v Speaker 8>They didn't want to tell him I shut him down.</v>

5490
02:28:17.720 --> 02:28:19.010
<v Speaker 8>That's one of the things that Greer was saying.</v>

5491
02:28:19.250 --> 02:28:20.061
<v Speaker 8>Greer was saying that,</v>

5492
02:28:20.061 --> 02:28:20.420
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>

5493
02:28:20.420 --> 02:28:21.180
<v Speaker 8>these presidents,</v>

5494
02:28:21.180 --> 02:28:21.361
<v Speaker 8>like,</v>

5495
02:28:21.361 --> 02:28:25.110
<v Speaker 8>people that want to get access to information that they don't,</v>

5496
02:28:25.340 --> 02:28:26.760
<v Speaker 8>it's not like you become president.</v>

5497
02:28:26.761 --> 02:28:27.001
<v Speaker 8>Okay,</v>

5498
02:28:27.001 --> 02:28:27.450
<v Speaker 8>come on.</v>

5499
02:28:27.450 --> 02:28:28.260
<v Speaker 8>We're going to tell you what's up.</v>

5500
02:28:28.260 --> 02:28:28.471
<v Speaker 8>Like,</v>

5501
02:28:28.471 --> 02:28:28.741
<v Speaker 8>no,</v>

5502
02:28:28.741 --> 02:28:29.730
<v Speaker 8>you don't need to know that.</v>

5503
02:28:30.150 --> 02:28:31.380
<v Speaker 8>You just need to be the president.</v>

5504
02:28:31.470 --> 02:28:31.920
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

5505
02:28:31.920 --> 02:28:32.753
<v Speaker 8>go do your shit.</v>

5506
02:28:33.240 --> 02:28:33.631
<v Speaker 8>But I'm like,</v>

5507
02:28:33.631 --> 02:28:33.721
<v Speaker 8>well,</v>

5508
02:28:33.721 --> 02:28:34.554
<v Speaker 8>who does know?</v>

5509
02:28:34.650 --> 02:28:35.490
<v Speaker 8>And then that's the real,</v>

5510
02:28:36.060 --> 02:28:37.320
<v Speaker 8>that's the real weird part.</v>

5511
02:28:37.370 --> 02:28:38.010
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

5512
02:28:38.010 --> 02:28:38.940
<v Speaker 8>If he is right,</v>

5513
02:28:39.810 --> 02:28:42.840
<v Speaker 8>that is how I think it would go down if he's telling the truth.</v>

5514
02:28:43.140 --> 02:28:44.790
<v Speaker 8>I really do think that the people,</v>

5515
02:28:44.791 --> 02:28:49.791
<v Speaker 8>st people that can keep something as crazy as the federal bank in place when</v>

5516
02:28:50.251 --> 02:28:52.320
<v Speaker 8>it's not really a branch of the federal government at all,</v>

5517
02:28:52.321 --> 02:28:53.490
<v Speaker 8>but they call it the federal bank.</v>

5518
02:28:53.790 --> 02:28:57.240
<v Speaker 8>The same people that can keep the military industrial complex moving in the same</v>

5519
02:28:57.241 --> 02:28:58.140
<v Speaker 8>rate that is moving now.</v>

5520
02:28:58.470 --> 02:29:00.690
<v Speaker 8>Those would be the people that would know about the Ufos.</v>

5521
02:29:00.720 --> 02:29:01.050
<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>

5522
02:29:01.050 --> 02:29:02.070
<v Speaker 8>there must be,</v>

5523
02:29:02.610 --> 02:29:03.060
<v Speaker 8>if you,</v>

5524
02:29:03.060 --> 02:29:05.820
<v Speaker 8>if you believe that corporations control the earth,</v>

5525
02:29:05.850 --> 02:29:10.590
<v Speaker 8>which it's Kinda obvious at this corporation from everything,</v>

5526
02:29:10.690 --> 02:29:12.870
<v Speaker 8>it's this guy to beat people at the head of these corporations.</v>

5527
02:29:12.940 --> 02:29:13.800
<v Speaker 8>Who are these people?</v>

5528
02:29:13.801 --> 02:29:15.870
<v Speaker 8>Like these old dudes with this fucking Ufo book.</v>

5529
02:29:15.930 --> 02:29:16.763
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

5530
02:29:17.100 --> 02:29:17.933
<v Speaker 8>So he might be right.</v>

5531
02:29:18.150 --> 02:29:18.731
<v Speaker 8>It could be right.</v>

5532
02:29:18.731 --> 02:29:19.564
<v Speaker 8>It could be right.</v>

5533
02:29:19.760 --> 02:29:20.700
<v Speaker 8>What do you think Brian's right?</v>

5534
02:29:21.960 --> 02:29:24.690
<v Speaker 8>How dare you just throw that out there like that?</v>

5535
02:29:24.960 --> 02:29:25.111
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

5536
02:29:25.111 --> 02:29:26.040
<v Speaker 3>I actually don't know.</v>

5537
02:29:26.100 --> 02:29:27.060
<v Speaker 3>I want to believe him by,</v>

5538
02:29:27.070 --> 02:29:27.361
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5539
02:29:27.361 --> 02:29:29.520
<v Speaker 3>there's just too much fishy in my mouth.</v>

5540
02:29:30.340 --> 02:29:32.970
<v Speaker 3>There's definitely a potential for fuckery.</v>

5541
02:29:33.240 --> 02:29:34.190
<v Speaker 3>I did a lot of fuckery.</v>

5542
02:29:34.330 --> 02:29:36.930
<v Speaker 3>That little creature thing that drives me the most crazy cause.</v>

5543
02:29:36.940 --> 02:29:37.773
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>

5544
02:29:37.830 --> 02:29:39.060
<v Speaker 3>it's just slow to me.</v>

5545
02:29:39.061 --> 02:29:39.571
<v Speaker 3>It's just like,</v>

5546
02:29:39.571 --> 02:29:39.811

<v Speaker 3>We can go.</v>

5566
02:30:00.511 --> 02:30:02.940
<v Speaker 3>He didn't say anything like you said what you believe.</v>

5567
02:30:03.750 --> 02:30:04.650
<v Speaker 8>He didn't do anything wrong.</v>

5568
02:30:05.730 --> 02:30:06.510
<v Speaker 8>Prove me wrong.</v>

5569
02:30:06.510 --> 02:30:06.751
<v Speaker 8>Look,</v>

5570
02:30:06.751 --> 02:30:10.590
<v Speaker 8>the Internet is probably predominantly on your side.</v>

5571
02:30:10.800 --> 02:30:11.800
<v Speaker 8>The Internet is pro.</v>

5572
02:30:11.850 --> 02:30:12.840
<v Speaker 8>If I had to guess.</v>

5573
02:30:12.900 --> 02:30:14.100
<v Speaker 8>I know my message board,</v>

5574
02:30:14.400 --> 02:30:16.500
<v Speaker 8>and this is no disrespect to Dr. Greer,</v>

5575
02:30:16.590 --> 02:30:17.670
<v Speaker 8>but my message board,</v>

5576
02:30:17.700 --> 02:30:19.500
<v Speaker 8>90% of them thought he was full of Shit.</v>

5577
02:30:19.560 --> 02:30:19.980
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

5578
02:30:19.980 --> 02:30:20.813
<v Speaker 8>90.</v>

5579
02:30:21.030 --> 02:30:21.870
<v Speaker 8>And I'm not bullshitting.</v>

5580
02:30:22.110 --> 02:30:22.861
<v Speaker 8>When I looked at the,</v>

5581
02:30:22.861 --> 02:30:22.951
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

5582
02:30:22.951 --> 02:30:23.610
<v Speaker 8>the thread,</v>

5583
02:30:23.610 --> 02:30:27.030
<v Speaker 8>it was pretty overwhelming that most people were calling fuckery.</v>

5584
02:30:27.210 --> 02:30:27.630
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

5585
02:30:27.630 --> 02:30:28.830
<v Speaker 8>But that's again,</v>

5586
02:30:29.010 --> 02:30:30.960
<v Speaker 8>when you make an extraordinary claim,</v>

5587
02:30:30.990 --> 02:30:32.820
<v Speaker 8>you have to provide extraordinary evidence.</v>

5588
02:30:32.821 --> 02:30:34.980
<v Speaker 8>And if you don't have that extraordinary evidence,</v>

5589
02:30:34.981 --> 02:30:37.080
<v Speaker 8>it becomes very difficult to convince people.</v>

5590
02:30:37.290 --> 02:30:40.230
<v Speaker 8>So if he really did have these experiences and he really does know all this</v>

5591
02:30:40.231 --> 02:30:41.064
<v Speaker 8>information,</v>

5592
02:30:41.160 --> 02:30:42.240
<v Speaker 8>that's all well and good,</v>

5593
02:30:43.020 --> 02:30:46.390
<v Speaker 8>but you can't go around telling people unless you have something</v>

5594
02:30:46.580 --> 02:30:47.000
<v Speaker 3>Shelby,</v>

5595
02:30:47.000 --> 02:30:47.833
<v Speaker 3>the hard evidence,</v>

5596
02:30:48.050 --> 02:30:48.880
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to hear it.</v>

5597
02:30:48.880 --> 02:30:49.050
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

5598
02:30:49.050 --> 02:30:49.671
<v Speaker 3>and it can't be,</v>

5599
02:30:49.671 --> 02:30:52.430
<v Speaker 3>you have to open the store and take this ride.</v>

5600
02:30:52.460 --> 02:30:54.160
<v Speaker 3>You got to be able to just show people harder than,</v>

5601
02:30:54.200 --> 02:30:54.381
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

5602
02:30:54.381 --> 02:30:55.050
<v Speaker 3>I guess you do.</v>

5603
02:30:55.050 --> 02:30:58.460
<v Speaker 3>What do you do though for an alien really does abducted you really does take you</v>

5604
02:30:58.461 --> 02:31:02.360
<v Speaker 3>away if you really do know what the fuck do you do if there is no evidence that</v>

5605
02:31:02.361 --> 02:31:03.101
<v Speaker 3>you can get what I'm saying.</v>

5606
02:31:03.101 --> 02:31:05.210
<v Speaker 3>If your best evidence is watch my film,</v>

5607
02:31:05.990 --> 02:31:09.500
<v Speaker 3>then it leads people to embrace not believing you.</v>

5608
02:31:09.550 --> 02:31:10.130
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

5609
02:31:10.130 --> 02:31:10.650
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>

5610
02:31:10.650 --> 02:31:11.483
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

5611
02:31:11.590 --> 02:31:16.590
<v Speaker 3>And right now it looks like that DNA test to find out like a simple basic DNA</v>

5612
02:31:17.061 --> 02:31:20.100
<v Speaker 3>test to see if it's something is human or it takes less</v>

5613
02:31:20.100 --> 02:31:20.933
<v Speaker 4>than 24 hours,</v>

5614
02:31:21.900 --> 02:31:23.910
<v Speaker 4>less than 24 hours to find out if something's human.</v>

5615
02:31:23.911 --> 02:31:24.180
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5616
02:31:24.180 --> 02:31:25.170
<v Speaker 4>Meaning like if I,</v>

5617
02:31:25.171 --> 02:31:27.030
<v Speaker 4>if I threw a piece of Bologna at you and you're like,</v>

5618
02:31:27.031 --> 02:31:27.331
<v Speaker 4>oh my God,</v>

5619
02:31:27.331 --> 02:31:28.164
<v Speaker 4>that's a human,</v>

5620
02:31:28.230 --> 02:31:29.970
<v Speaker 4>you can take it to the DNA lab and they'll go,</v>

5621
02:31:29.971 --> 02:31:30.151
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

5622
02:31:30.151 --> 02:31:30.960
<v Speaker 4>it's Baloney.</v>

5623
02:31:30.960 --> 02:31:31.793
<v Speaker 5>Hmm.</v>

5624
02:31:32.050 --> 02:31:32.800
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

5625
02:31:32.800 --> 02:31:37.180
<v Speaker 5>So would they be able to distinguish between an animal and I'm like a monkey</v>

5626
02:31:37.181 --> 02:31:40.000
<v Speaker 5>baby or a monkey fetus or a human feet?</v>

5627
02:31:40.001 --> 02:31:40.710
<v Speaker 5>Would they be like,</v>

5628
02:31:40.710 --> 02:31:41.543
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

5629
02:31:41.670 --> 02:31:44.840
<v Speaker 4>it's pretty much you just the human markup,</v>

5630
02:31:44.870 --> 02:31:45.680
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5631
02:31:45.680 --> 02:31:47.700
<v Speaker 4>d our human DNA is,</v>

5632
02:31:47.940 --> 02:31:48.990
<v Speaker 4>what's the smallest monkey?</v>

5633
02:31:49.920 --> 02:31:51.060
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

5634
02:31:51.260 --> 02:31:52.093
<v Speaker 5>what's his name?</v>

5635
02:31:52.230 --> 02:31:52.801
<v Speaker 5>This is a real,</v>

5636
02:31:52.801 --> 02:31:53.810
<v Speaker 5>it's a really tiny monkey,</v>

5637
02:31:53.811 --> 02:31:54.200
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

5638
02:31:54.200 --> 02:31:56.670
<v Speaker 5>There's a tiny spider monkey there.</v>

5639
02:31:57.010 --> 02:31:57.771
<v Speaker 5>They're way bigger.</v>

5640
02:31:57.771 --> 02:31:59.300
<v Speaker 5>There's some really small primates.</v>

5641
02:31:59.900 --> 02:32:01.940
<v Speaker 5>What it maybe it was like a dried out,</v>

5642
02:32:01.941 --> 02:32:02.910
<v Speaker 5>really small crime.</v>

5643
02:32:03.000 --> 02:32:06.380
<v Speaker 5>I mean it doesn't necessarily have to be even a human finger monkey.</v>

5644
02:32:06.830 --> 02:32:09.360
<v Speaker 5>I wonder how long it would take to find out whether or not something like,</v>

5645
02:32:10.640 --> 02:32:10.911
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>

5646
02:32:10.911 --> 02:32:11.840
<v Speaker 5>look how small that is.</v>

5647
02:32:12.700 --> 02:32:13.190
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

5648
02:32:13.190 --> 02:32:14.300
<v Speaker 5>that's pretty small.</v>

5649
02:32:15.490 --> 02:32:15.770
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

5650
02:32:15.770 --> 02:32:16.760
<v Speaker 5>and if that was all like,</v>

5651
02:32:16.850 --> 02:32:19.760
<v Speaker 5>oh it's hair fell off and some of the its tail.</v>

5652
02:32:20.210 --> 02:32:20.901
<v Speaker 5>That's what it looked like.</v>

5653
02:32:20.901 --> 02:32:22.100
<v Speaker 5>That came out of my belly button.</v>

5654
02:32:22.910 --> 02:32:24.140
<v Speaker 5>That probably lives in your asshole.</v>

5655
02:32:24.560 --> 02:32:25.820
<v Speaker 5>Probably don't even know about it.</v>

5656
02:32:26.390 --> 02:32:27.230
<v Speaker 5>He lives in there.</v>

5657
02:32:27.500 --> 02:32:28.820
<v Speaker 5>It's like a mouse in the house.</v>

5658
02:32:29.030 --> 02:32:30.230
<v Speaker 5>The happiest little monkey.</v>

5659
02:32:30.740 --> 02:32:33.010
<v Speaker 5>He's got a little fucking set up in there.</v>

5660
02:32:34.480 --> 02:32:35.070
<v Speaker 5>Brian's ass.</v>

5661
02:32:35.070 --> 02:32:36.170
<v Speaker 5>He's got a barrier.</v>

5662
02:32:36.320 --> 02:32:41.320
<v Speaker 5>He sets up whenever Brian's taking a shit cause past it blocks off in the area</v>

5663
02:32:41.721 --> 02:32:44.210
<v Speaker 5>that he's got cordoned off in Brian's after his house.</v>

5664
02:32:46.370 --> 02:32:47.520

5665
02:32:47.640 --> 02:32:48.530
<v Speaker 5>push the shit out.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I think it's great.</v>

5872
02:37:55.161 --> 02:37:55.641
<v Speaker 2>I think there's,</v>

5873
02:37:55.641 --> 02:37:56.181
<v Speaker 2>I have no problem.</v>

5874
02:37:56.181 --> 02:37:57.170
<v Speaker 2>I mean I use stitcher,</v>

5875
02:37:57.171 --> 02:37:59.900
<v Speaker 2>but people hate everything to hate themselves.</v>

5876
02:38:00.230 --> 02:38:03.860
<v Speaker 2>90% of the hate you getting out of all these people in line is they hate</v>

5877
02:38:03.861 --> 02:38:04.694
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>

5878
02:38:05.190 --> 02:38:06.470
<v Speaker 2>I went to a restaurant the other day,</v>

5879
02:38:06.471 --> 02:38:10.880
<v Speaker 2>they got three stars and I read the reviews like so many people would just</v>

5880
02:38:10.881 --> 02:38:11.740
<v Speaker 2>shitting on it to.</v>

5881
02:38:11.750 --> 02:38:14.810
<v Speaker 2>It was amazing because I had heard it was amazing.</v>

5882
02:38:14.900 --> 02:38:15.290
<v Speaker 2>People like,</v>

5883
02:38:15.290 --> 02:38:17.270
<v Speaker 2>oh there's this new Italian restaurant opened.</v>

5884
02:38:17.271 --> 02:38:18.104
<v Speaker 2>It's so good.</v>

5885
02:38:18.140 --> 02:38:19.010
<v Speaker 2>It's not cheap.</v>

5886
02:38:19.040 --> 02:38:19.520
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>

5887
02:38:19.520 --> 02:38:20.151
<v Speaker 2>it's pricey,</v>

5888
02:38:20.151 --> 02:38:22.550
<v Speaker 2>but the dishes were fantastic in la.</v>

5889
02:38:22.940 --> 02:38:24.360
<v Speaker 2>It's out in um,</v>

5890
02:38:24.590 --> 02:38:25.460
<v Speaker 2>like West hills,</v>

5891
02:38:25.970 --> 02:38:28.580
<v Speaker 2>but it was a like five star restaurants,</v>

5892
02:38:28.660 --> 02:38:29.990
<v Speaker 2>like in my eyes I was like,</v>

5893
02:38:30.050 --> 02:38:30.231
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

5894
02:38:30.231 --> 02:38:31.340
<v Speaker 2>this place is amazing.</v>

5895
02:38:31.340 --> 02:38:32.360
<v Speaker 2>It's really good.</v>

5896
02:38:32.480 --> 02:38:34.370
<v Speaker 2>The Pasta was fresh pasta,</v>

5897
02:38:34.610 --> 02:38:34.821
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5898
02:38:34.821 --> 02:38:35.630
<v Speaker 2>it's like the way they,</v>

5899
02:38:35.630 --> 02:38:35.811
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

5900
02:38:35.811 --> 02:38:36.980
<v Speaker 2>it was legit.</v>

5901
02:38:37.360 --> 02:38:38.540
<v Speaker 2>Then I read the reviews.</v>

5902
02:38:38.570 --> 02:38:40.400
<v Speaker 2>It's like people are just constant.</v>

5903
02:38:40.460 --> 02:38:43.100
<v Speaker 2>People get upset about restaurants when they didn't get the seat,</v>

5904
02:38:43.101 --> 02:38:45.400
<v Speaker 2>when they thought they were going to get it though one star.</v>

5905
02:38:45.450 --> 02:38:46.160
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

5906
02:38:46.160 --> 02:38:47.070
<v Speaker 2>This is a fucking shit.</v>

5907
02:38:47.090 --> 02:38:48.530
<v Speaker 2>There was a hostess and you're like,</v>

5908
02:38:48.550 --> 02:38:48.980
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

<v Speaker 2>or waiter spilled water,</v>

5910
02:38:49.940 --> 02:38:50.990
<v Speaker 2>Lonestar fuck you.</v>

5911
02:38:52.340 --> 02:38:53.810
<v Speaker 2>But in the podcast APP,</v>

5912

<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

5913
02:38:54.531 --> 02:38:56.660

<v Speaker 2>And for the next hour home,</v>

5934
02:39:26.450 --> 02:39:26.870
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>which is fascinating.</v>

5936
02:39:28.310 --> 02:39:29.870
<v Speaker 2>Dan Carlin's hardcore history.</v>

5937
02:39:29.960 --> 02:39:33.000
<v Speaker 2>We had them as a guest on the podcast a couple of weeks ago and now I'm a,</v>

5938
02:39:33.010 --> 02:39:34.050
<v Speaker 2>I'm addicted to his,</v>

5939

<v Speaker 2>his podcast.</v>

5944
02:39:43.251 --> 02:39:44.084
<v Speaker 2>It's hot.</v>

5945
02:39:44.870 --> 02:39:45.651
<v Speaker 2>It's so nuts.</v>

5946
02:39:45.651 --> 02:39:46.280
<v Speaker 2>I was only 12,</v>

5947
02:39:46.280 --> 02:39:46.881
<v Speaker 2>1200.</v>

5948
02:39:46.881 --> 02:39:47.440
<v Speaker 2>There was a few,</v>

5949
02:39:47.440 --> 02:39:48.261
<v Speaker 2>a few hundred years ago.</v>

5950
02:39:48.261 --> 02:39:50.930
<v Speaker 2>This motherfucker was just carving its way across the world.</v>

5951
02:39:51.200 --> 02:39:51.351
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5952
02:39:51.351 --> 02:39:52.200
<v Speaker 2>I'd love to listen to that.</v>

5953
02:39:52.250 --> 02:39:53.083
<v Speaker 2>Amazing.</v>

5954
02:39:53.280 --> 02:39:56.390
<v Speaker 2>And I got it immediately at a red light with that podcast APP.</v>

5955
02:39:56.391 --> 02:39:57.680
<v Speaker 2>So if you don't like the podcast App,</v>

5956
02:39:57.681 --> 02:40:02.681
<v Speaker 2>go fuck your soul and introduces you to the podcasting to so many fans too that</v>

5957
02:40:03.440 --> 02:40:04.940
<v Speaker 2>you didn't know existed.</v>

5958
02:40:04.941 --> 02:40:06.620
<v Speaker 2>Like you always tend to think of,</v>

5959
02:40:06.621 --> 02:40:06.921
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

5960
02:40:06.921 --> 02:40:10.330
<v Speaker 2>you've had obviously like way more exposure and,</v>

5961
02:40:10.331 --> 02:40:10.761
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

5962

<v Speaker 2>being on television,</v>

5963
02:40:11.661 --> 02:40:12.410

5964
02:40:12.410 --> 02:40:13.950
<v Speaker 2>you forget like when you do</v>

5965

5966
02:40:16.050 --> 02:40:16.381

5971
02:40:26.641 --> 02:40:30.510
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to do Toronto and it's all because of the podcast.</v>

5972
02:40:30.720 --> 02:40:33.090
<v Speaker 4>I'm doing that underground comedy club.</v>

5973
02:40:33.690 --> 02:40:34.710
<v Speaker 4>I heard a place is awesome.</v>

5974
02:40:34.820 --> 02:40:35.670
<v Speaker 4>That's fucking awesome.</v>

5975
02:40:35.671 --> 02:40:37.630
<v Speaker 4>I'm going there in May talking.</v>

5976
02:40:37.710 --> 02:40:38.610
<v Speaker 4>Just got back from there.</v>

5977
02:40:38.640 --> 02:40:39.031
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

5978
02:40:39.031 --> 02:40:40.950
<v Speaker 4>He said it was a fucking incredible experience.</v>

5979
02:40:41.070 --> 02:40:42.180
<v Speaker 4>I'm so excited to go.</v>

5980
02:40:42.181 --> 02:40:43.710
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to get really weak early in May.</v>

5981
02:40:43.820 --> 02:40:47.000
<v Speaker 2>You and the beautiful thing about podcasts and,</v>

5982
02:40:47.030 --> 02:40:47.360
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5983
02:40:47.360 --> 02:40:50.420
<v Speaker 2>the impact of podcasts is that it,</v>

5984
02:40:50.570 --> 02:40:52.910
<v Speaker 2>if people don't like the podcast,</v>

5985
02:40:53.210 --> 02:40:54.320
<v Speaker 2>it's not successful.</v>

5986
02:40:54.410 --> 02:40:55.400
<v Speaker 2>It's really that simple,</v>

5987
02:40:55.401 --> 02:40:55.700
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

5988
02:40:55.700 --> 02:40:56.270
<v Speaker 2>They don't,</v>

5989
02:40:56.270 --> 02:40:58.850
<v Speaker 2>they don't take off unless people like them.</v>

5990
02:40:58.990 --> 02:40:59.360
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>

5991
02:40:59.360 --> 02:41:00.800
<v Speaker 2>no one's promoting it.</v>

5992
02:41:01.100 --> 02:41:02.450
<v Speaker 2>It's totally democratic.</v>

5993
02:41:02.451 --> 02:41:03.860
<v Speaker 2>It's totally organic.</v>

5994
02:41:03.861 --> 02:41:06.650
<v Speaker 2>It totally ha it either happens or it doesn't happen.</v>

5995
02:41:06.651 --> 02:41:07.400
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

5996
02:41:07.400 --> 02:41:09.320
<v Speaker 2>So the two people that enjoy our podcast.</v>

5997
02:41:09.350 --> 02:41:10.183
<v Speaker 2>Thank you very much.</v>

5998
02:41:10.220 --> 02:41:11.420
<v Speaker 2>We appreciate the fuck out of it.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You have some shade.</v>

6001
02:41:13.150 --> 02:41:13.820
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

6002
02:41:13.820 --> 02:41:17.150
<v Speaker 2>It's like the greatest opportunity to have your own show that could have ever</v>

6003
02:41:17.151 --> 02:41:17.710
<v Speaker 2>existed.</v>

6004
02:41:17.710 --> 02:41:18.170
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

6005
02:41:18.170 --> 02:41:18.890
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing else.</v>

6006
02:41:18.890 --> 02:41:20.990
<v Speaker 2>Nothing else that comes close to giving you the kind of freedom.</v>

6007
02:41:21.260 --> 02:41:22.220
<v Speaker 2>We're number one right now.</v>

6008
02:41:22.790 --> 02:41:23.470
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

6009
02:41:23.470 --> 02:41:25.360
<v Speaker 2>And all comedy podcasts suck.</v>

6010
02:41:25.860 --> 02:41:26.630
<v Speaker 2>Suck,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I talked to a hundred people that lost fucking a hundred pounds or more.</v>

6049
02:42:08.290 --> 02:42:08.561
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

6050
02:42:08.561 --> 02:42:09.250
<v Speaker 2>I'm not joking.</v>

6051
02:42:09.250 --> 02:42:09.610
<v Speaker 2>I keep,</v>

6052
02:42:09.610 --> 02:42:12.520
<v Speaker 2>I talked to 30 people this weekend instead of changed their life.</v>

6053
02:42:12.980 --> 02:42:15.120
<v Speaker 2>And it happens every time we do shows the,</v>

6054
02:42:15.280 --> 02:42:16.960
<v Speaker 2>the weirdness of it all.</v>

6055
02:42:16.961 --> 02:42:20.060
<v Speaker 2>And the unexpectedness of it all is the inspirational aspect of it.</v>

6056
02:42:20.061 --> 02:42:21.700
<v Speaker 2>I never thought that that was going to happen.</v>

6057
02:42:22.000 --> 02:42:25.000
<v Speaker 2>Never thought that people are going to take these crazy rants just getting</v>

6058
02:42:25.001 --> 02:42:27.550
<v Speaker 2>pissed off and talking shit about things or breaking things down and take,</v>

6059
02:42:27.551 --> 02:42:30.700
<v Speaker 2>take them and put them into youtube clips and then those youtube clips would get</v>

6060
02:42:30.701 --> 02:42:32.020
<v Speaker 2>hundreds of thousands of views.</v>

6061
02:42:32.350 --> 02:42:32.681
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

6062
02:42:32.681 --> 02:42:34.000
<v Speaker 2>it's millions or some of them.</v>

6063
02:42:34.001 --> 02:42:34.211
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

6064
02:42:34.211 --> 02:42:34.660
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

6065
02:42:34.660 --> 02:42:35.680
<v Speaker 2>it's really crazy.</v>

6066
02:42:35.681 --> 02:42:36.370
<v Speaker 2>It's incredible.</v>

6067
02:42:36.370 --> 02:42:37.001
<v Speaker 2>It's incredible.</v>

6068
02:42:37.001 --> 02:42:38.080
<v Speaker 2>And I don't know how it happened.</v>

6069
02:42:38.081 --> 02:42:38.980
<v Speaker 2>You affect people's lives,</v>

6070
02:42:39.010 --> 02:42:39.430
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

6071
02:42:39.430 --> 02:42:39.821
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

6072
02:42:39.821 --> 02:42:41.410
<v Speaker 2>it's all organic.</v>

6073
02:42:41.440 --> 02:42:43.390
<v Speaker 2>It was no one ever planned to do any of this.</v>

6074
02:42:43.391 --> 02:42:45.400
<v Speaker 2>And that's the most beautiful thing about it.</v>
