<v Speaker 2>met in my life.</v>

13
00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.670
<v Speaker 2>I asked you for what happened with BMI</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a measurement of the height and</v>

14
00:00:36.671 --> 00:00:37.900
<v Speaker 2>weight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I said,</v>

<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got the height,</v>

16

<v Speaker 2>so just fucking measures height.</v>

17
00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.560
<v Speaker 2>I'm six foot four man line.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was no question.</v>

18
00:00:47.561 --> 00:00:52.040
<v Speaker 2>It was like we all knew that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

19
00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:58.450
<v Speaker 2>it's time</v>
<v Speaker 2>to say</v>

20
00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.590
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did</v>

21
00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:12.860
<v Speaker 2>you did you did.</v>

22
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.540
<v Speaker 1>Is it was after you right now for</v>
<v Speaker 1>reinforcing negative stereotypes.</v>

23
00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:19.573
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

24
00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.740
<v Speaker 2>you're so of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when they got the national it was</v>

25
00:01:24.891 --> 00:01:29.891
<v Speaker 2>going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to ask how many tweets did you get</v>

26
00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:31.513
<v Speaker 2>calling you a?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

27
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.450
<v Speaker 2>I've got my nipples pierced diaper for</v>
<v Speaker 2>dates.</v>

28
00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:46.480
<v Speaker 2>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your voice breaking like Kevin</v>

29
00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.570
<v Speaker 2>mccallister and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said these boys basketball game you</v>

30
00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.010
<v Speaker 2>did on your own</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking play the guitar when you guys</v>

31
00:02:01.011 --> 00:02:02.000
<v Speaker 2>are punching,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eating pizza.</v>

32
00:02:02.001 --> 00:02:05.610
<v Speaker 2>I was down when you went to Asia for</v>
<v Speaker 2>four months to get out of a bag.</v>

33
00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.490
<v Speaker 3>So at that point it became him taking</v>
<v Speaker 3>this opportunity,</v>

34
00:02:11.491 --> 00:02:13.050
<v Speaker 3>going to denver,</v>
<v Speaker 3>being with Dwayne,</v>

35
00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.280
<v Speaker 3>getting paid into muscle farm thing and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then the whole thing with connor</v>

36
00:02:17.281 --> 00:02:21.570
<v Speaker 3>happened on the TV show before this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>before any of this happened,</v>

37
00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.840
<v Speaker 3>conor mcgregor started calling him a</v>
<v Speaker 3>columbus snake because me and connor had</v>

38
00:02:27.781 --> 00:02:30.630
<v Speaker 3>one conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're sitting there and he goes,</v>

39
00:02:30.631 --> 00:02:31.291
<v Speaker 3>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

40
00:02:31.291 --> 00:02:35.760
<v Speaker 3>congratulations on Tj defending his belt</v>
<v Speaker 3>because he was still on her team is last</v>

41
00:02:35.761 --> 00:02:37.350
<v Speaker 3>title defense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I go,</v>

42
00:02:37.351 --> 00:02:37.831
<v Speaker 3>thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

43
00:02:37.831 --> 00:02:40.470
<v Speaker 3>but what's up with Dwayne?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Say that no one on your team wants to be</v>

44
00:02:40.471 --> 00:02:41.460
<v Speaker 3>champions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's weird.</v>

45
00:02:41.461 --> 00:02:41.911
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

46
00:02:41.911 --> 00:02:45.210
<v Speaker 3>he's just bitter because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's trying to get everyone to go out to</v>

47
00:02:45.211 --> 00:02:46.360
<v Speaker 3>his camp,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

48
00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.150
<v Speaker 3>he's just being a hater,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this and that.</v>

49
00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.990
<v Speaker 3>And he goes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He took that little bit of,</v>

50
00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.780
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of drama between me and Dwayne.</v>

51
00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.070
<v Speaker 3>Dwayne saying that no one on our team</v>
<v Speaker 3>want to be your champions,</v>

52
00:02:56.071 --> 00:02:58.620
<v Speaker 3>including cody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who sent them a text,</v>

53
00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.100
<v Speaker 3>a tweet that said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

54
00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.980
<v Speaker 3>keep my name out your mouth and you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a jealous girlfriend or whatever.</v>

55
00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:06.960
<v Speaker 3>And he said he took that one little</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing and then next time you saw tj he</v>

56
00:03:06.961 --> 00:03:07.794
<v Speaker 3>goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

57
00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.510
<v Speaker 3>there's a snake in the grass and just</v>
<v Speaker 3>built it in this big thing.</v>

58
00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:14.720
<v Speaker 3>So that means either how well he is so</v>
<v Speaker 3>good at seeing people,</v>

59
00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:15.470
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

60
00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.690
<v Speaker 3>So that took like what really happened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is tj got paid to go somewhere</v>

61
00:03:19.691 --> 00:03:21.250
<v Speaker 3>else me and saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

62
00:03:21.251 --> 00:03:22.140
<v Speaker 3>fine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're going to do that,</v>

63
00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:23.170
<v Speaker 3>cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But like,</v>

64
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.310
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're on that team,</v>

65
00:03:24.311 --> 00:03:28.660
<v Speaker 3>you're on that team.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then then connor turned the public</v>

66
00:03:28.661 --> 00:03:33.070
<v Speaker 3>around on him</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it came out later after the</v>

67
00:03:33.071 --> 00:03:36.280
<v Speaker 3>thing and so then you became the victim</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then he.</v>

68
00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.840
<v Speaker 3>And now Tj is new stories that I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

69
00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.070
<v Speaker 3>I got mad that he was trained with Duane</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ludwig and I kicked him off the team.</v>

70
00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.641
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

71
00:03:42.641 --> 00:03:47.641
<v Speaker 3>Tj now has a snake as his logo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know on the ultimate fighter he</v>

72
00:03:47.651 --> 00:03:49.060
<v Speaker 3>brought in snakes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

73
00:03:49.061 --> 00:03:50.680
<v Speaker 3>He just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's at home with it,</v>

74
00:03:50.681 --> 00:03:52.090
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's cool with it.</v>

75
00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.240
<v Speaker 3>So it's all good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're rewinding back a little bit like</v>

76
00:03:55.241 --> 00:03:56.710
<v Speaker 3>if you want to be friends,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's be friends,</v>

77
00:03:56.711 --> 00:03:58.120
<v Speaker 3>but don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't,</v>

78
00:03:58.121 --> 00:03:59.380
<v Speaker 3>don't lie.</v>

79
00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.910
<v Speaker 4>Do you think it was a good idea to write</v>
<v Speaker 4>that memo?</v>

80
00:04:03.911 --> 00:04:06.510
<v Speaker 4>Like if you had to go back again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you were in front of your computer</v>

81
00:04:06.511 --> 00:04:07.520
<v Speaker 4>and you're ready,</v>
<v Speaker 4>press send,</v>

82
00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.520
<v Speaker 4>would you uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe I would wait for my year end</v>

83
00:04:11.521 --> 00:04:12.354
<v Speaker 4>bonus.</v>

84
00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:17.520
<v Speaker 3>Oh Man.</v>

85
00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:20.250
<v Speaker 4>I mean I think I would have pushed</v>
<v Speaker 4>harder,</v>

86
00:04:20.251 --> 00:04:21.900
<v Speaker 4>even harder on the diversity of</v>
<v Speaker 4>programs,</v>

87
00:04:21.901 --> 00:04:26.901
<v Speaker 4>although I met with them personally and</v>
<v Speaker 4>I kept pinging them and I sent so many</v>

88
00:04:27.001 --> 00:04:30.390
<v Speaker 4>emails.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just trying to have a discussion</v>

89
00:04:30.391 --> 00:04:33.150
<v Speaker 4>about this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I went through multiple other</v>

90
00:04:33.151 --> 00:04:36.420
<v Speaker 4>programs and sent this document,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this exact document to them.</v>

91
00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.600
<v Speaker 4>So it's really unclear what I could've</v>
<v Speaker 4>done differently.</v>

92
00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:42.270
<v Speaker 4>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>

93
00:04:42.271 --> 00:04:47.010
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know so much about the</v>
<v Speaker 4>underground conservative network before</v>

94
00:04:47.011 --> 00:04:49.420
<v Speaker 4>all of this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And Google you mean?</v>

95
00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.330
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And even within silicon valley,</v>

96
00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.720
<v Speaker 4>there was attempts to sort of connect</v>
<v Speaker 4>them between companies,</v>

97
00:04:54.721 --> 00:04:59.460
<v Speaker 4>but there's so much verification that</v>
<v Speaker 4>you need to go through to be able to</v>

98
00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:01.560
<v Speaker 4>join one of these.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to have a pseudonym.</v>

99
00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:04.530
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean you don't need to be totally</v>

100
00:05:04.531 --> 00:05:06.070
<v Speaker 4>anonymous,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

101
00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:08.940
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't want because there's active</v>

102
00:05:08.941 --> 00:05:10.740
<v Speaker 4>attempts to try to infiltrate these</v>
<v Speaker 4>groups.</v>

103
00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:12.130
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

104
00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.660
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this happens a lot where they'll try to</v>

105
00:05:15.661 --> 00:05:19.020
<v Speaker 4>join a group,</v>
<v Speaker 4>act as if they're one of them and then</v>

106
00:05:19.021 --> 00:05:22.170
<v Speaker 4>just record what's happening and then</v>
<v Speaker 4>expose them</v>

107
00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.520
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can take anything out of context and</v>

108
00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:29.550
<v Speaker 4>it will be shown as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>racism or something.</v>

109
00:05:29.551 --> 00:05:30.450
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What means.</v>

110
00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:31.770
<v Speaker 4>Think of what we said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

111
00:05:31.771 --> 00:05:34.890
<v Speaker 4>not you but me joking around in this</v>
<v Speaker 4>conversation.</v>

112
00:05:34.891 --> 00:05:38.470
<v Speaker 4>You could clearly take something I've</v>
<v Speaker 4>said out of context and make them a</v>

113
00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:41.550
<v Speaker 4>monster,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you're in an email and you're</v>

114
00:05:41.551 --> 00:05:44.280
<v Speaker 4>complaining about some sort of diversity</v>
<v Speaker 4>program</v>

115
00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:50.250
<v Speaker 4>yet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what they often do is they will find</v>

116
00:05:50.251 --> 00:05:54.690
<v Speaker 4>someone that they disagree with and then</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll scour through their entire</v>

117
00:05:54.691 --> 00:05:57.030
<v Speaker 4>history at Google and all the emails</v>
<v Speaker 4>that they've.</v>

118
00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:02.860
<v Speaker 4>And try to look for some way to</v>
<v Speaker 4>blacklist them or show that this person</v>

119
00:06:03.111 --> 00:06:05.000
<v Speaker 4>is evil,</v>
