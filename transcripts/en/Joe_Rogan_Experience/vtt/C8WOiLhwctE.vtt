1
00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:05.690
We have so much to talk about today.

2
00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:07.400
I can barely get through these fucking commercials.

3
00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:12.560
This episode of the Joe Rogan experience is brought to you by 1-800-FLOWERS.
Now,

4
00:00:12.561 --> 00:00:15.980
I make a big risk in saying this episode of the Joe Rogan Experience,

5
00:00:15.981 --> 00:00:19.730
since my name is Joe Rogan,
and everybody knows that saying your name,

6
00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.953
the full name,

7
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:22.150
<v 0>okay,</v>

8
00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.580
<v 1>that's a douchey thing to do.
Why do you mean?</v>

9
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:28.270
If you were like Brennan Shab will be the heavyweight champ of the world.

10
00:00:28.271 --> 00:00:31.510
Brendan Schaub knows how to train.
Brendan Schaub has tremendous cardio.

11
00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:33.380
People are like,
why the fuck is Brendan Shop?

12
00:00:33.381 --> 00:00:35.940
St His own when you're talking about is how in the third person is an issue.

13
00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.670
So you can't take the job.
It's my fucking experience.
It's your experience.

14
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.310
I can't say,
did Joe Rogan,
who did I?

15
00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.840
Every time I say that somebody aligned Callen show,
I cringe.

16
00:00:43.841 --> 00:00:47.740
I apologize afterwards.
This is the experience from now on.
All right,
whatever.

17
00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:51.040
This is the,
anyway,
we're brought to you by 1-800-FLOWERS.

18
00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.060
It's almost mother's Day.
You little freakazoids.
You know the deal,
man,

19
00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:56.260
your mom made you.

20
00:00:56.261 --> 00:00:59.160
She built you inside of her vagina and you should be super kind to her.

21
00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.830
I don't know anything about science.
I do.
It's in the vagina.

22
00:01:02.831 --> 00:01:05.860
You got to go through the vagina and the KSG gates of heaven.
It's science.

23
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.390
It is science.
And uh,

24
00:01:07.391 --> 00:01:10.960
your mom is awesome and your mom made you and your awesome mom would love some

25
00:01:10.961 --> 00:01:15.370
awesome flowers and now is the time to send her the best.
This mother's Day.

26
00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:20.440
A beautiful bouquet bouquet.
I love to use this.
Where's there's sound different?

27
00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.980
A bouquet of roses.
Why don't we have an American work for Booz k?

28
00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.870
It's a fucking bundle.
Okay.
Do you know that 60% of all,
uh,

29
00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.130
English words are,
uh,
French origins.
So makes sense.

30
00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.510
Bouquets an English word,
right?
Yeah.
So you,
you actually like a,

31
00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.890
anything with that,
like most of front,
most,

32
00:01:38.891 --> 00:01:41.500
most 60% of franchises I think derived from English.

33
00:01:41.501 --> 00:01:46.000
That's the first night I teach when he was learning French
military.
Anyway,

34
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.360
beautiful bouquet of roses from one 800 flowers.com.

35
00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.520
Go get that shit for your mom's son.

36
00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.160
That's the one thing I always envied about black guys.
They got to say,

37
00:01:54.161 --> 00:01:58.150
my mom's my mom anyway.
Yeah.

38
00:01:58.151 --> 00:02:02.010
You know how my mom's is always telling me you got to get done my homework.

39
00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.050
If you're white,
if you're white,
you're white.
You talk like that.

40
00:02:05.051 --> 00:02:09.010
Don't call me anymore.
It's a very good point.
Yeah.

Shampooing your hair.

76
00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.970
It's called dude,
I told my neck.

77
00:04:34.971 --> 00:04:39.190
I just want the listeners know I was shampooing my hair this morning.
Sham point,

78
00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:43.670
maybe a little too vigorously and my neck out of out of sorts.
You're for sure.

79
00:04:43.671 --> 00:04:47.030
Using what?
How do you do that?
You're doing bad things.

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:01.970
<v 2>Well,
good experience.</v>

85
00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:04.610
Joe Rogan podcast.

86
00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:11.340
Love sizing you up as it gets older is getting more thin,

87
00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:13.560
more feminine,
more gay.
Were up there talking about it.

88
00:05:13.561 --> 00:05:16.440
What we're playing pool was talking about,
I don't even like to eat food anymore.

89
00:05:16.441 --> 00:05:20.190
It's because your body is preparing you to become this wave,
like older games.

90
00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:22.380
My sister and my sister looked at me and she goes,

91
00:05:22.381 --> 00:05:24.120
you know you got a came when I go,
why?
She goes,

92
00:05:24.121 --> 00:05:27.140
because you look like one of those fish in a polluted lake.
Yeah,
that's big.

93
00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:30.210
Your body's getting,
I was like,
what are you,
I'm the same way.
She goes,
no,

94
00:05:30.211 --> 00:05:34.160
you're not.
You got to start eating shoved food.
You're a dime piece for the,

95
00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:35.460
for the gay community for sure.

96
00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:40.410
I was just with Jimmy Burke in New York with gay men.

97
00:05:40.411 --> 00:05:44.130
I was at the duplex surrounded by gay men.
No looks,
I got nothing.

98
00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:47.810
That's when you know you're getting old.
It's about the other hand walk

99
00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:50.420
<v 1>around,
Dude.
You don't walk around like you're,
you've got possessed.</v>

100
00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.170
I wasn't walking around and you're uncomfortable and worried about how they're

101
00:05:54.171 --> 00:05:58.490
proceeding because my neck hurts.
That's why you hurt yourself.
Yeah,
exactly.

102
00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:01.280
My chest,
I heard myself shaving my chest.

103
00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:03.350
You hurt your neck when you're shampooing your hair.

104
00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:05.930
The bottom I'd say in the gay community,

105
00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:07.550
I think just the brush up from the bottom.

106
00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:11.330
A lot of gay men are just way more muscular.
I was walking down West Hollywood.

107
00:06:11.331 --> 00:06:14.300
I was literally the guy who looked like he had rickets.
I didn't appreciate it.

108
00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:18.380
Let's Hollywood's a different bird.
My first week living here,

109
00:06:18.381 --> 00:06:20.960
I was walking down West Hollywood.
Never been there,
right?
Yeah.

110
00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:25.880
Going down there was not familiar.
It was Gainesville is,
I do not care,

111
00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:26.571
but yeah,

112
00:06:26.571 --> 00:06:30.020
I have a tank top on it cause I just got done working out doing boxes over there

113
00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:33.820
to walk around without a tank top on.
Once you boxing,

114
00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:37.250
especially if you know you're going to be in a gay neighborhood neighborhood.

115
00:06:37.251 --> 00:06:41.630
That's what I'm saying.
Or fight for America.
Yeah.

116
00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:44.090
I was going to say you were walking around with like with a tank top because you

117
00:06:44.091 --> 00:06:45.770
were in your experimental phase.

118
00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:50.440
There's things you have to do and sometimes you just gotta sometimes like

119
00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:52.820
playing hard to get,
it was on the bucket list.
Oh boy.

120
00:06:52.821 --> 00:06:55.970
Likes to play horse girls that we'll put on a short skirt and high heels.

121
00:06:55.971 --> 00:06:59.100
You'd if they have a man,
they just,
they want it.
They want us to feel it out.

122
00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:03.200
Everyone know that you know the business might be closed down to the public,

123
00:07:03.201 --> 00:07:08.150
but it's large shop knows the size of every one of his friends.

124
00:07:08.151 --> 00:07:11.390
Dick's,
I can guarantee he investigates.
That's a question he asks.
He's like,
Hey,

125
00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:15.560
he's gay.
He's an honest man.
Uncomfortable.
Yeah.

126
00:07:15.561 --> 00:07:19.070
It's honest man and he likes talking about boy stuff,
but I,

127
00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:20.300
I was in West Hollywood.

128
00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:24.020
Richard Simmons pulls up and Alexis in full costume goes.

129
00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:27.380
If I had one wish you'd be to be with you for at night.

130
00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:29.550
I didn't know he had a southern accent,
but,
well,
I,

131
00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:32.920
that's probably the best money I've ever heard.
I don't know.

132
00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:35.750
I don't know how to do it.
I didn't want to do it.
My findings,

133
00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:38.840
I don't want to do my voice.
I don't even know if that's like,

134
00:07:38.841 --> 00:07:41.360
if it's possible that that came out of your mouth.
I feel like I'm getting,

135
00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:43.440
that was weird,
right?
You feel like,
I feel like

136
00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:50.530
I've actually watched him a number of tasks.
Talking over at James Scott,

137
00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:55.210
he's louder and he's excited.
There you go.
That's Richard Simmons.

138
00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:57.170
I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
I heard what you said,

139
00:07:57.180 --> 00:08:01.040
which I was looking over to see if Jamie was so high that worked in the buttons.

140
00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:06.650
Slipping it in there.
I was shocked.
I'm shocked.

141
00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:11.990
My experience with less Hollywood,
really flamboyantly gay exercise instructors.

142
00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:14.780
Look at Richard Simmons and go,
I don't fucking get,
it.
Ain't about me.

143
00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:19.970
What about me?
By the way,
by the way,
has a bad fire,

144
00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:22.980
but he feels like he's built like a CPA.
I've never seen this,

145
00:08:22.981 --> 00:08:27.470
that skinny fat build,
these huge Afros as muscular as your average librarian.
We,

146
00:08:27.471 --> 00:08:29.410
you know,
I had Steve Maxwell in here the other day,

147
00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:31.300
the strength and conditioning coach,
Kettlebell Guy,

148
00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:35.510
he's a Zach Maxwell's dad who's a top flight Jujitsu fighter today.

149
00:08:35.511 --> 00:08:38.230
These days on one of the only guys would be Kron Gracie,

150
00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:40.850
Zach Maxwell's a real beast.
He's Dad,
Steve Maxwell.

151
00:08:40.851 --> 00:08:44.300
That's like been my kettle bell instructor and friend for years cause out of La.

152
00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:49.580
Um,
he's well,
he's got the craziest life ever,
man.
He's not out of La.

153
00:08:49.581 --> 00:08:53.630
He's out of everywhere.
He travels all over the world.
He goes here,
he goes there.

154
00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:56.190
I don't remember the original point.
What you just talking about.

155
00:08:56.191 --> 00:08:57.024
We're talking about uh,

156
00:08:57.030 --> 00:09:01.250
being muscular and versus like Richard Simmons who's built like a crossfit

157
00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:05.190
instructor.
That's what it is.
He introduced me to the guy who invented crossfit.

158
00:09:05.191 --> 00:09:09.740
I didn't know the guy in Ventura.
Glas fit is fat.
Well Greg had like,

159
00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:13.500
he's not even,
he's not even remotely shade now cause he got a gut.

160
00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:16.290
I can't listen to that.
Have you seen it?
No,

161
00:09:16.291 --> 00:09:20.210
but if of big fact I was trying to tell me how to lift,
I'm going to be like,
Nah,

162
00:09:20.211 --> 00:09:22.560
I'm cool bro.
Look at this.
Look at this image of this guy.
No,

163
00:09:22.561 --> 00:09:25.350
but that's because of that.
Greg has a set of tits.
No,

164
00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:28.650
he had polio when he was young and one of his legs is much smaller than the

165
00:09:28.651 --> 00:09:33.360
other and so it's hard.
Oh,
it's right.
Oh,
so he has titties because of it.
No,

166
00:09:33.361 --> 00:09:36.180
but he can't,
he can't exercise the way you would be able to because he has,

167
00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:39.870
he had polio and he's partially paralyzed cupcakes.
He does now.

168
00:09:39.871 --> 00:09:43.380
He knows what he does.
Is He,
um,
he was a really good gymnast when he was younger,

169
00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:48.360
but because he's got issues with his back,
his spine,
he,
that,

170
00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:52.800
that's,
that's,
that's how it's hard for him and I call bullshit.

171
00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:56.700
That's enlightening.
But it seems like he's overeating and for sure it's diet.

172
00:09:56.760 --> 00:10:01.710
I mean,
if you're,
he's obviously he was walking around,
right?
Walks around.
Yeah.

173
00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:04.290
Okay.
Yeah,
you're right.
This is a crossfit.

174
00:10:04.291 --> 00:10:07.290
We're not talking about the guy who was the head of Arby's.
Okay.

175
00:10:07.291 --> 00:10:09.180
We're talking about the guys,
the head of,
Oh look at that.

176
00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:13.950
I mean if that'd be in health and slash or are you going to listen?

177
00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:15.140
Maybe,
maybe knows.

178
00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:18.000
Things like there's some people that are really good coaches that never really

179
00:10:18.001 --> 00:10:18.770
fought,
right?

180
00:10:18.770 --> 00:10:21.180
There's people who are like students of all sorts of different things,

181
00:10:21.181 --> 00:10:24.270
whether it's athletic movements and they don't possess any physical talent.

182
00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:28.530
It's a super,
super common thing.
In fact,
people become fans of football.

183
00:10:28.531 --> 00:10:31.920
No more about football than football players who are professional.
Right?

184
00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:33.630
That's a fact.
Absolutely.
Same thing with them.

185
00:10:33.631 --> 00:10:36.470
And look at your average coach and football.
Oh for sure.
And they're there.

186
00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:40.860
Rex Ryan and those guys are just way out of shape.
Tony,
Tony,
I mean,
you know,

187
00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:44.310
perfect example,
perfect example,
true.
But in football,

188
00:10:44.311 --> 00:10:48.120
some of those linemen are big boys out of shape.
So you can,
you can see that.

189
00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:50.300
The point is you can know what is saying.

190
00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:53.290
You can know he got them to sky size without,
without um,

191
00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:56.480
being the walking embodiment of exercise.
Right?

192
00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:58.290
But look at all those other people Jamie just threw up.

193
00:10:58.291 --> 00:11:01.170
There's other people that are all fitness instructors.
Look at that.

194
00:11:01.171 --> 00:11:03.660
That's what they're supposed to look like.
That guy,
the third one,

195
00:11:03.661 --> 00:11:06.690
index to the blonde hot chick.
He tells me something to do.
I'm going to do it.

196
00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:10.110
He says that John won't say how high,
but guys,
abs are ridiculous.

197
00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:14.820
[inaudible] listening to the guy who's that feed out.
Just find that strange.

198
00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:17.460
Well,
when they say,
give us your best pick and you do that,
I'm not going to,

199
00:11:17.461 --> 00:11:20.490
I don't think he's that flexible.
They're,
they're all fine for me.
I like it.

200
00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:25.290
I like it.
Yeah.
You don't want to have one on ones with the girl though.

201
00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:27.500
She's too hot.
I'm too close to,

202
00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:31.950
I don't want your wife trained with a male personal trainer.
No,

203
00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:37.020
there I did it.
A bodybuilder girl is she and Gold's gym.

204
00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:38.790
I met her and she was a bodybuilder,

205
00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:43.820
but natural and so hot and I put in my eye and her boyfriend,

206
00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:49.020
her ex boyfriend was a bodybuilder in the gym and he,

207
00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:50.940
he'd give me this,
these terrible,

208
00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:55.970
he just walk around just in Gold's and grunting and really mad at me and just

209
00:11:56.611 --> 00:11:59.470
just hating me cause he still liked her.
It was such an uncomfortable thing,

210
00:11:59.471 --> 00:12:01.630
but I know what a good top and is,

211
00:12:01.631 --> 00:12:04.180
isn't it the best when you're around a guy who's a bitch,

212
00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:05.470
you can't get over a check.

213
00:12:05.471 --> 00:12:09.130
So he gets mad at you because you liked the checklist.
Oh,
glorious.

214
00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:14.200
Those men are so important just to know that there's bitches like that out
there.

215
00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:19.210
I just know there's men who just are not men do mass great preacher curls,

216
00:12:19.391 --> 00:12:24.220
like concentration curls,
eh,
eh.
And I was like,
all right,
no problem.

217
00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:27.670
Your only problem is that you both think that the same person is awesome.

218
00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.370
That's the only problem.
It's not like you beat her up.

219
00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:32.020
It's not like you stole money from her.

220
00:12:32.021 --> 00:12:35.220
It's not like you took his car and threw it in the river as well,

221
00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:38.410
but just a competition.
But to the meat heads,
the fence,

222
00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:41.660
he was probably trying to make it work.
And then you come in with this big spot.

223
00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:47.290
There's no defense,
there's no defense.
I bitch is a bitch.
You know,
you gotta,

224
00:12:47.291 --> 00:12:50.260
you gotta deal with your position in life and if a girl likes someone else and

225
00:12:50.261 --> 00:12:53.560
you grovel and you tried to get her back or you get upset at the guy,

226
00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:56.310
you're a bit,
well the other thing,
the other thing is I was like,

227
00:12:56.470 --> 00:12:58.810
I was on mad TV at the time and he wanted to be an actor.

228
00:12:58.810 --> 00:13:03.730
He wanted to be the next,
it wasn't gonna happen.
This guy sounds like a winner.

229
00:13:03.830 --> 00:13:06.090
Just like,
dude,
you're better looking relaxed.
You've gotta,
you know,

230
00:13:06.091 --> 00:13:10.180
you're more muscular if you're into that.
There's nothing wrong with other guys.

231
00:13:10.181 --> 00:13:13.510
Login the same check you like.
It's just this life is fucking short.

232
00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:17.050
If guys don't like your chicken,
you're dating an ugly chick.
It's also,

233
00:13:17.051 --> 00:13:20.020
there's too many Sandra Bullock movies and just dude run around out there that

234
00:13:20.021 --> 00:13:21.970
think that there's a gal out there.
That's the one.

235
00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:26.510
This is [inaudible] more on the talk.
She was the one Brendan,
Brendan,

236
00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:29.700
I fucking drank with.
That girl was shit out by the fucking porch.

237
00:13:29.701 --> 00:13:31.240
It was like a Bruce Springsteen song.

238
00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:34.870
We would drink wine to go to and even tried to fuck up bro.

239
00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:36.730
I ain't even tried to fuck her.
I didn't want to ruin something.

240
00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:42.010
That's my favorite.
It's not going to Joe and I go like this,
like,

241
00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:44.650
I don't know.
I gotta think I gotta break up,
but I love her and he goes,

242
00:13:44.651 --> 00:13:47.840
NATO and that we start talking.
I got,
well,
I got what you don't think I,
I don't,

243
00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:50.250
you don't think I love it?
He goes,
Nah,
definitely not.
Anyway,
so,

244
00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:52.660
and he wouldn't even give it any time.
It just goes,
no,
you don't.
I go,
no,
no,
no.

245
00:13:52.661 --> 00:13:55.990
But I think I do is not,
no,
I go,
you don't think I love her.
He's not.
Anyway,
so,

246
00:13:55.991 --> 00:13:58.300
and he just could change something and kept rolling forward.

247
00:13:58.301 --> 00:13:59.350
He wasn't going to hear me.

248
00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:03.100
He would try to convince himself that he loves somebody and she was the most

249
00:14:03.490 --> 00:14:08.260
insane relationships and he's like,
this is all I love.
It's a love.

250
00:14:08.410 --> 00:14:11.890
I love her.
I go,
no,
you don't.
You don't look.
Do you want to eat?

251
00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:14.500
You want to go get somebody?
I was like blowing it off.

252
00:14:14.530 --> 00:14:19.510
He would just literally gave it no entertainment.
None.

253
00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:23.080
You're not in love with her.
Stop.
Listen to yourself.
Do you want to,

254
00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:26.350
you have to stop lying to yourself in in life and you as you get older,

255
00:14:26.351 --> 00:14:29.830
you stopped doing that hopefully,
or you become a crazy person,

256
00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:31.391
but you have to.

257
00:14:31.391 --> 00:14:35.590
You have to confront who you're pretending to be and and the lies you tell

258
00:14:35.591 --> 00:14:38.350
yourself.
It's so important.
It's tough when you're younger though,

259
00:14:38.390 --> 00:14:42.730
you're like on this grind.
Like for me,
I'm on this grind.
I'm married to the UFC,

260
00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:47.550
so girls,
they become it there.
They play second fiddle,

261
00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:52.040
the UFC.
I made the UFC and she can be a real bitch,
you know what I'm saying?
She

262
00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:54.710
<v 3>talked to deal with sometimes and you health is on the line,</v>

263
00:14:54.711 --> 00:14:58.340
your consciousness is on the line.
She says fish actually super salvage.

264
00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:02.360
I can't go to your family's barbecue on a Saturday cause I gotta chill and

265
00:15:02.361 --> 00:15:04.790
recovering train,
isn't it all?

266
00:15:04.791 --> 00:15:09.440
So don't you find as an elite athlete that you have to be really conscious of

267
00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:14.000
your mindset and what you think about now?
I mean if you're weak minded,

268
00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:17.800
think about what
the psychology,

269
00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:21.470
the psychology of like when you train for Lawsky the psychology of staying

270
00:15:21.471 --> 00:15:23.350
positive,
not negative.
It's what mean

271
00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:28.610
you have to risk that when you get involved in a relationship.

272
00:15:28.611 --> 00:15:32.600
Cause oftentimes relationships go bad and some of the worst times you could ever

273
00:15:32.601 --> 00:15:35.500
have in the gym will come right after you got in a big fight with your girl.

274
00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:39.230
You just can't concentrate and you get,
I've had that happen before.
It happens.

275
00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:43.880
Why you don't deal with chicken heads.
That's what I mean.

276
00:15:43.881 --> 00:15:45.800
You gotta be disciplined about the people you surround yourself with.

277
00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:49.830
Well I won't even entertain the idea of a chicken head chicken that comes along.

278
00:15:49.831 --> 00:15:51.380
I'm like,
no,
keep,
keep clucking get out.

279
00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:55.820
So you wouldn't date the girl that was with sterling,
the ultimate chicken edge.

280
00:15:55.821 --> 00:15:58.850
She deserves a trophy.
They all commit chicken out of all time.

281
00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:03.620
The La Clippers has great,
listen,
if someone said,
listen,

282
00:16:03.621 --> 00:16:05.030
you're going to bang this chick,

283
00:16:05.210 --> 00:16:09.370
you're gonna lose the fucking Los Angeles Clippers if you hang out with this big

284
00:16:09.950 --> 00:16:12.740
thinking about that,
the biggest chicken hen of all time,

285
00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:16.940
he lost the team because it's chick.
Take all the racism out.
Whatever.

286
00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:21.200
He's a racist bastard,
right?
Sucks.
They should not be that way.
Granted,

287
00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:24.980
if he never signed up for this chicken head,
he would still own the Los Angeles.

288
00:16:24.981 --> 00:16:29.180
Click upbeat.
And not only that,
do you know the whole story behind it?
The wife,

289
00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:33.810
his wife was suing this girl for embezzling money that the,
the,
uh,

290
00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:36.680
the man sterling had clearly given this chick.

291
00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:39.290
He wanted to give her some things about gifts and stuff.

292
00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:43.580
I bought her gifts and so the wife was trying to take back the gifts so she was

293
00:16:43.581 --> 00:16:46.920
sooner and that's when the,
the Cha,
the tape magically revealed.

294
00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:51.110
He sounds a little drunk in the tape probably.
He's lit up.

295
00:16:51.450 --> 00:16:54.530
He came home from a fucking dinner,
had a couple of drinks in him.

296
00:16:54.650 --> 00:16:59.540
Can you imagine the next morning he sobered up and was like,
what?

297
00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:02.580
It's totally illegal by the way.
You can't just record something.
Yeah.

298
00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:05.010
Not In California.
She's saying they're saying two things.
The same.

299
00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:06.560
One that she didn't record it.

300
00:17:06.561 --> 00:17:09.560
Somebody else recorded it and just saying to that he was aware that he was being

301
00:17:09.561 --> 00:17:12.990
recording both.
Nowadays it's not a chance.
Bolted.
Preposterous.
Yeah.

302
00:17:13.070 --> 00:17:14.630
You're actually not allowed in California,

303
00:17:14.631 --> 00:17:17.600
I think without the consent of the purse.
Two parties,
two parties,
consent.

304
00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:20.510
You know what he needs to do because he needs to go around the nation.

305
00:17:20.511 --> 00:17:24.140
He needs to make positive out of this and it needs to be how to avoid chicken

306
00:17:24.141 --> 00:17:27.680
heads one on one.
He is the ultimate face with chicken heads.
Well,

307
00:17:27.681 --> 00:17:30.010
I don't know about clippers because of the,
yeah,
but he's going to,

308
00:17:30.050 --> 00:17:31.940
he only bought the clippers for 12 million bucks.

309
00:17:31.941 --> 00:17:35.130
It's worth a half a billion deal.
Smart businessman,
sal.

310
00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:37.240
It's where the half a billion now.
Everyone's trying to buy.

311
00:17:37.241 --> 00:17:40.700
Oprah is trying to buy it.
Right.
Floyd Mayweather.
Meanwhile,
he's suing the,

312
00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:42.740
he's suing the NBA.
Oh,
he's not going to go.

313
00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:46.800
He's suing them for billions of dollars.
He was a divorce lawyer case.
No,

314
00:17:46.810 --> 00:17:50.010
in a stranger.
He's no stranger to the litigation.
He was divorced.
Can't

315
00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:53.850
<v 1>just fucking do that to someone because of a private conversation that was</v>

316
00:17:53.851 --> 00:17:57.450
illegally wiretap.
You can't do that.
Yeah.
Even though they're assholes,

317
00:17:57.451 --> 00:17:58.500
even though he's an asshole,

318
00:17:58.590 --> 00:18:02.070
you can't do that because who knows what his state of mind is.

319
00:18:02.071 --> 00:18:04.770
He shouldn't have to protect his state of mind and wonder if it was going to be

320
00:18:04.771 --> 00:18:06.240
public.
If it's in a private moment,

321
00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:10.020
if he wants to say something completely inappropriate because he's drunk and

322
00:18:10.021 --> 00:18:14.400
then once it cancels and in his own house and then wants to recanted the next

323
00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:18.090
day or feel the folly of his ways or feel bad about what he said and correct

324
00:18:18.091 --> 00:18:21.300
himself or not,
he still what he says publicly,

325
00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:25.500
she'd be public statements and this idea that you're supposed to pretend that

326
00:18:25.501 --> 00:18:29.820
everyone is listening to you and watching you every minute is ridiculous.

327
00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:32.310
It's unfair.
It's unprecedented.

328
00:18:32.311 --> 00:18:36.900
And you're talking about an old man who is probably barely understanding what's

329
00:18:36.901 --> 00:18:40.710
going on.
The Internet was invented when he was 61 fucking years old.

330
00:18:40.711 --> 00:18:44.190
Wrap your head around that.
Okay.
20 years ago,

331
00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:47.970
1994 what will,
what kind of internet?
We have some dog shit.

332
00:18:47.971 --> 00:18:52.971
Aol Internet 61 then no idea you have use.

333
00:18:54.580 --> 00:18:57.020
It's chicken,
but you have the shoes and the hard case to listen.

334
00:18:57.030 --> 00:18:59.160
You got to do what you gotta do when you're old man.

335
00:18:59.161 --> 00:19:01.800
You want to fuck young pussy.
You're not going to get chicks that are balanced.

336
00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:05.880
She's not even not hot to plenty.
Plenty out.
What he told me,
you know,

337
00:19:05.890 --> 00:19:08.990
and she looked at him for have looked at him,
have you seen,

338
00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:11.520
have you looked at is have you looked at his team?

339
00:19:11.521 --> 00:19:12.870
He owns the Los Angeles Clippers.

340
00:19:12.871 --> 00:19:16.380
Hasn't mattered if he looks like an elephant's balls that's been stuffed into

341
00:19:16.381 --> 00:19:19.680
the shape of a man.
He's,
he's ancient horse though.

342
00:19:19.681 --> 00:19:22.200
I've seen where it's go the fig and olive in Hollywood,

343
00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:26.170
you're see some old dudes with some young chicks,
playboy mansion.
Oh my God.

344
00:19:26.171 --> 00:19:30.510
That's a gift.
He's an old guy and she's young girl and them's the rules.
Okay,

345
00:19:30.511 --> 00:19:33.570
let's not pretend it isn't anything other than what it is.
Look at that.

346
00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:36.540
That's what it is,
man.
That's what it's been since the beginning of time.

347
00:19:36.570 --> 00:19:40.380
She's planning.
He does look like hot and melted cheese.
Not that hot.

348
00:19:40.650 --> 00:19:43.470
Can we get a better picture?
I was.
He stopped Dabo.
Listen,
Brendan,

349
00:19:43.471 --> 00:19:44.970
beauty and the beast of all.
First of all,

350
00:19:44.971 --> 00:19:48.780
you are dealing with a totally different class of human.
So let's just drop that.

351
00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:53.760
Okay?
You're
right.
You're right.

352
00:19:53.761 --> 00:19:58.761
You're right and hot to an old dude that looks like an elephant's balls that has

353
00:19:59.671 --> 00:20:02.420
been shaped into,
doesn't matter,

354
00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:05.250
doesn't matter when you own the clippers.

355
00:20:05.251 --> 00:20:10.170
Bitches are lining up taking money.
Two things.
You have taken some iteration.

356
00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:14.820
One,
as you get older,
you'll give less,
less a fuck about a girl being perfect.

357
00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:19.230
And that's why MILF porn exists.
You want dirty old chicks that are just,
fuck it.

358
00:20:19.231 --> 00:20:21.060
Let's give up.
And they're,
they're all weird.

359
00:20:21.061 --> 00:20:24.360
Looks [inaudible] keep their ones shocking.
Rare.
It looks at me.

360
00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:27.090
We were talking to these,
these proof us and we're there.

361
00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:28.740
The couple of 21 year old girls,

362
00:20:28.741 --> 00:20:31.720
I don't know how old they were there with this hanging around and,
and um,

363
00:20:32.010 --> 00:20:36.200
he's peeing and he goes and those girls and I was like,
yeah,
yeah,

364
00:20:36.210 --> 00:20:38.490
they look pretty hot to me.
And he goes,
no,
because at my age,

365
00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:42.060
a girl can have a goat head if she's that age and she's got a body like that,

366
00:20:42.061 --> 00:20:46.530
I don't care if she's got a goat head.
I still think she's hot.
Your standards,

367
00:20:46.531 --> 00:20:48.100
you're not,
you know,
you're,
you're

368
00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:52.180
<v 3>not looking at symmetry on the level that you are when you're 84 or whatever he</v>

369
00:20:52.181 --> 00:20:55.630
is.
Hot seats.
A hot chick.
First of all,
you want to own the clippers.

370
00:20:55.631 --> 00:20:59.830
You're pulling some.
Okay.
It tells not bad.
Listen,
she,
he can't see.
Okay.

371
00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:03.220
Do you know what it's fucking vision must be like cats must be ridiculous.

372
00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:06.720
His vision must be ridiculous.
It has to do with Joe used to do,

373
00:21:06.730 --> 00:21:11.350
don't Joe used to do this this bit that I think ties to this day to me is maybe

374
00:21:11.351 --> 00:21:13.210
the funny,
one of the funniest things I've ever seen.

375
00:21:13.870 --> 00:21:18.870
It was Hugh Hefner takings Viagara like tic tacs and the girls trying to psych

376
00:21:20.891 --> 00:21:25.210
themselves up to have sex with them and,
and the one girl is like easy.
I can see,

377
00:21:25.211 --> 00:21:29.020
I can see white hair coming out of his ass.
She got a hold your hair.
Don't worry.

378
00:21:29.021 --> 00:21:32.170
He'll get you in the audition,
but Baywatch just go in there.
He's like lucky,

379
00:21:32.171 --> 00:21:37.070
lucky,
lucky,
lucky.
Please stop.
No,
oh no.
It's all been,

380
00:21:37.150 --> 00:21:39.400
I don't even remember how that,
because I was so good dude.

381
00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:42.460
I talked to white American women on his ass.
I talked to a playmate.

382
00:21:42.850 --> 00:21:46.840
We had the discussion because I said,
it's a little weird to me and she goes,

383
00:21:46.841 --> 00:21:49.180
what's weird?
I go,
well these girls,

384
00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:53.290
what was the show on e that they have girls next door.

385
00:21:53.291 --> 00:21:58.090
I said the show girls next door.
This old dude in these three hot blondes.

386
00:21:58.210 --> 00:22:01.810
It's kind of,
it's just weird.
She goes,
what's weird?
I go,
well,

387
00:22:01.870 --> 00:22:04.750
obviously they're not in into it because the way it looks,

388
00:22:04.751 --> 00:22:07.540
they're just didn't do it to purse,
you know,
better their careers.
And she goes,

389
00:22:07.810 --> 00:22:12.670
oh no,
he's a great guy.
He takes care of us ball.
I'm like,
it's weird.
I said,

390
00:22:12.671 --> 00:22:15.670
what's your dad say about it?
She was,
oh,
I don't have a dad.
That's a given.

391
00:22:15.671 --> 00:22:16.504
I could have told you that.

392
00:22:16.550 --> 00:22:17.960
<v 1>Yeah,
it's a lot of that.</v>

393
00:22:17.961 --> 00:22:21.440
They don't have a real male role model maybe or someone who looks at the

394
00:22:21.441 --> 00:22:25.250
situation and goes,
hey,
this is my little daughter.
Why is she with this old man?

395
00:22:25.251 --> 00:22:29.300
What?
What have I done wrong to make her lean towards?
It's really old guy,

396
00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:32.480
<v 3>but I'm not,
I'm not hating on Hugh Hefner.
I'm hating on the girls.</v>

397
00:22:32.830 --> 00:22:34.100
I will do your thing.
I'm

398
00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:36.730
<v 1>definitely not hate on the girls because the girls,
a lot of them,</v>

399
00:22:36.820 --> 00:22:40.030
like girls who get into that situation,
whether they're,

400
00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:44.560
they're taking naked pictures or doing porn or you know,
almost all of them,

401
00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:49.570
they come from a situation somewhere early on in their life where someone did

402
00:22:49.571 --> 00:22:53.320
something bad to them.
You know,
it's a super common thing.
It's not all of them.

403
00:22:53.410 --> 00:22:58.010
There's a lot of girls who don't,
but they,
the percentages girls,
no.
Yes.

404
00:22:58.030 --> 00:23:01.390
Play mates,
I don't think,
well,
I think that that is a very similar,

405
00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:03.580
like I don't think there's anything wrong with either one.

406
00:23:03.581 --> 00:23:06.940
I should be real clear about that.
Like,
I don't want to take photographs naked,

407
00:23:07.210 --> 00:23:10.600
do something wrong.
There's nothing wrong with having sex on video.

408
00:23:10.601 --> 00:23:11.590
There's nothing wrong with any of it.

409
00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:15.940
But a lot of people that associate like their sexuality with how they express

410
00:23:15.941 --> 00:23:18.730
themselves or their sexuality exclusively,

411
00:23:18.731 --> 00:23:20.560
how they promote and present themselves.

412
00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:25.320
Like sometimes it comes from a place where they were abused somewhere else.

413
00:23:26.030 --> 00:23:28.580
That makes me sad.
So when I see,
you know,

414
00:23:28.670 --> 00:23:30.490
and I'm not necessarily saying that that happened,

415
00:23:30.491 --> 00:23:32.440
those girls are with Haffner but when I see,
no,

416
00:23:32.441 --> 00:23:35.950
I think those girls are opportunists.
They might be,
but they might not be.

417
00:23:35.951 --> 00:23:36.700
They might,

418
00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:39.700
he might really be the first guy that was ever like super sweet and they knew

419
00:23:39.701 --> 00:23:40.840
that he was going to support them.

420
00:23:41.250 --> 00:23:45.830
It's super possible like you shake your head like that,
but totally true.
Like

421
00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:48.050
<v 2>if you're a chick and you're really vulnerable.</v>

422
00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:51.290
If I'm a chick and I'm the prom king or you know what I'm saying,

423
00:23:51.291 --> 00:23:56.030
the Prom Queen of the Prom Queen,
I get done.
I have,
I don't have shit to do.

424
00:23:56.031 --> 00:23:59.030
Right?
I'm like what am I gonna do?
I'm a hot chick.
What am I do playboy?

425
00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:01.310
Well sign me up Mattson.

426
00:24:01.311 --> 00:24:05.450
100 could be animation and then you do maximum 100 and that's like,
all right,

427
00:24:05.451 --> 00:24:08.960
well let's step our game up.
Let's get these titties,
I'll get more money.
Great.

428
00:24:08.961 --> 00:24:11.810
Now making money,
just showing my titties and it goes from there.

429
00:24:12.110 --> 00:24:15.470
Let's throw a dicon now you're doing porno.
That's the vicious cycle.

430
00:24:15.530 --> 00:24:17.870
I don't know.
Cause I just had to us that Kira on the podcast,

431
00:24:17.871 --> 00:24:21.330
she wrote that book,
I'm insatiable.
She,
you know she is.
Yeah,
totally.

432
00:24:21.370 --> 00:24:24.680
And it was really interesting conversation because I kept trying to find out

433
00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:28.670
like kind of what would the origin of doing this was because she does like you

434
00:24:28.671 --> 00:24:30.320
know nine guys and all that.

435
00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:34.220
And she said actually she very very self aware because the book was really funny

436
00:24:34.221 --> 00:24:38.600
actually and kind of interesting in how open she was about how destructive this

437
00:24:38.601 --> 00:24:41.300
was going to be for her future in certain ways.
Like having kids,

438
00:24:41.301 --> 00:24:42.680
never working with kids.
And I said,

439
00:24:42.681 --> 00:24:45.440
what do you think it was that caused you to take this jump?

440
00:24:45.441 --> 00:24:47.750
Cause she's really very self aware.
I go,

441
00:24:47.751 --> 00:24:50.990
you probably could have been successful at a lot of things because you're pretty

442
00:24:50.991 --> 00:24:53.120
smart and you know and and you,

443
00:24:53.121 --> 00:24:58.010
she came from a pretty tight family and she said,
you know,
honestly I don't know.

444
00:24:58.100 --> 00:25:02.930
I don't know what it was that got me to take this step cause I knew full well

445
00:25:02.931 --> 00:25:05.090
and still do that.
The repercussions.

446
00:25:05.630 --> 00:25:08.680
A lot of which I can never walk away from this.
You have a boyfriend?
Yes.

447
00:25:08.681 --> 00:25:11.240
She's married to a guy in the business course.

448
00:25:11.390 --> 00:25:14.270
Could you be married to a Bordeaux?
No.
Could you do it,
Jill?

449
00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:17.560
<v 4>Be Tough.
Action.
You'd have to have a strong mind.</v>

450
00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:19.290
<v 2>Plus people don't know why they do what they do.</v>

451
00:25:19.291 --> 00:25:22.170
And I don't know that it says cut and dry as saying,
well you know,

452
00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:24.630
most of the time I think it's probably damaged somewhere.

453
00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:28.220
I do think there are examples where people are okay.

454
00:25:28.790 --> 00:25:31.160
<v 4>The Armani suit example you talked to Darin Diorama on,</v>

455
00:25:31.161 --> 00:25:32.600
she didn't have any abuse or childhood.

456
00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:34.850
She's a very healthy attitude about the whole thing.

457
00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:38.760
She's a very smart chick too.
Interesting to talk about it.
Cause uh,
you know,

458
00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:42.790
she sorta disposes the myth and you know,
all those myths.
What's the matter?

459
00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:47.510
Things blocking just face who's thing?
Okay.

460
00:25:47.511 --> 00:25:51.800
Well maybe we should move to cameras.
Okay.
Sorry.
Where were we?

461
00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:56.320
<v 2>You were talking about,
uh,
about,
uh,
porn,
porn stars and damage and,</v>

462
00:25:56.330 --> 00:25:57.350
and being self aware.

463
00:25:57.520 --> 00:26:01.540
<v 4>I forgot my point.
So it's just fucking,</v>

464
00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:04.430
yeah,
it doesn't matter the,
you know,

465
00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:07.870
the bottom line is there's a lot of them.

466
00:26:07.871 --> 00:26:12.310
Whatever the percentages where it's 40% and 50% a lot of it comes from damage.

467
00:26:12.311 --> 00:26:16.150
So that's how I look at it.
Like I always feel bad,
I feel sorry for him.
Sure.

468
00:26:16.290 --> 00:26:20.500
I have daughters too,
so I see what it's,
I think there's a,
and I have a sister,

469
00:26:20.570 --> 00:26:23.920
it's a very different thing growing up being a chick,
it's a different world man.

470
00:26:23.970 --> 00:26:25.360
You know,
it's uh,
my bed,

471
00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:31.020
<v 2>honorable guy can be strong gay guys hitting on us and I like last night I went</v>

472
00:26:31.481 --> 00:26:35.240
to go get vegetables late at night,
which is weird.
Anyways,

473
00:26:35.241 --> 00:26:38.780
I go to get vegetables in Marina del Rey and I'm walking by this frozen yogurt

474
00:26:38.781 --> 00:26:42.220
place and these two guys are making out,
which is whatever,

475
00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:44.010
you just don't see it a lot.
So I was like,
oh

476
00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:46.650
<v 1>damn.
That's the way they kept me looking at them.
They stare at me,</v>

477
00:26:46.651 --> 00:26:49.500
they make some smart comment under their breath.
I was like,
man,

478
00:26:49.501 --> 00:26:53.340
just look forward.
Just keep moving.
Just keep moving.
Like super nervous.

479
00:26:53.570 --> 00:26:57.090
And then I thought this owl hot chicks feel all the time,

480
00:26:57.360 --> 00:27:00.840
even with real shitty looking dudes are getting no matter what they're always

481
00:27:00.841 --> 00:27:03.030
getting hit on.
I'll give you one more,
I'll give you one more.

482
00:27:03.031 --> 00:27:04.170
If you are with your check,

483
00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:07.170
your check wouldn't feel threatened by two dudes that were in to you.

484
00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:11.680
But if you were a hot chick and you were,
that's disrespectful.
That's difference.

485
00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:13.890
Disrespectful.
Oh,
it's definitely different swagger.
But if you're,

486
00:27:13.891 --> 00:27:16.710
if you're a hot chick and you were the guy that can't defend you and there's a

487
00:27:16.711 --> 00:27:19.590
bunch of big scary guys are hitting on you,
that's even worse.

488
00:27:19.770 --> 00:27:23.610
It's an even worse situation.
So to be a check like it least,

489
00:27:23.611 --> 00:27:26.670
you don't have to worry about yourself physically,
like most likely.

490
00:27:26.910 --> 00:27:31.470
And think about how nervous you got.
You're a UFC fighter and those two guys,

491
00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:37.650
I was just like,
I know that they're gonna hold me down and write my ass.
Right.

492
00:27:37.651 --> 00:27:42.240
But think about that.
You are physically dominant over them.
100% it's still in.

493
00:27:42.490 --> 00:27:46.380
It still felt uncomfortable.
That's dark shit,
man.

494
00:27:46.381 --> 00:27:49.800
So you think about what it's like to be a 100 pound girl and there's three or

495
00:27:49.801 --> 00:27:53.160
four dudes who look like you and they're buying yogurt and you're trying to get,

496
00:27:53.370 --> 00:27:55.890
can I get that bake and Yay.
Yes.
A Bacon Bitch

497
00:27:57.990 --> 00:28:02.990
fucking cause these giants like a gazelle among lions can't run away from,

498
00:28:04.741 --> 00:28:05.880
I'm not going as fast.

499
00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:11.340
It's very rare you get thick cock ogres banding up and raping guys in the

500
00:28:11.341 --> 00:28:14.490
fucking salad bar.
Especially in Marina del Rey.
Yeah.

501
00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:15.960
People always want to say that like,
you know,

502
00:28:15.961 --> 00:28:18.660
like there's a guy that I had on the podcast had actually tried to make that

503
00:28:18.661 --> 00:28:20.010
argument.
He was like,
well,

504
00:28:20.011 --> 00:28:23.190
you know the statistics on rape are very deceptive because a lot of people don't

505
00:28:23.191 --> 00:28:26.610
know that more men are raped.
Then women's right.
And I go,
yeah,

506
00:28:26.611 --> 00:28:30.780
but you know who's raping the men?
Other men.
So it's fucking stupid.

507
00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:34.830
Like what Kinda dumb ass point is that other men are raping men.

508
00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:37.950
It's not like women or raping men who gets raped.
More men or women.

509
00:28:37.951 --> 00:28:39.540
You'd be surprised at the outcome.

510
00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:44.910
I also don't believe that by that of course it is present in prison.

511
00:28:45.150 --> 00:28:48.930
A lot of guys are getting raped in prison and you factor nozzle guys are getting

512
00:28:48.931 --> 00:28:51.630
raped.
That's just a fact.
Especially if you consider rape,

513
00:28:51.660 --> 00:28:54.840
like there are things that people are considering rape now that really wasn't

514
00:28:54.841 --> 00:28:56.790
considered rape when we were younger.
What are we talking about?

515
00:28:56.791 --> 00:28:58.140
We're talking about a lot of different things.

516
00:28:58.141 --> 00:29:01.670
You said getting a girl drunk and and yeah,
to get you in trouble.

517
00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:03.800
Getting a girl drunk,
getting your lot

518
00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:06.150
<v 5>jail,
who spent a lot of time in jail.</v>

519
00:29:06.151 --> 00:29:08.910
And one of the things they all said is that I go,
what about the right thing?

520
00:29:08.911 --> 00:29:11.040
And they go,
you know man,
a lot of that he goes,

521
00:29:11.510 --> 00:29:14.760
you got to realize is that there are a lot of guys in jail willing to give it up

522
00:29:14.761 --> 00:29:18.960
for free.
And so if you are the kind of guy who,

523
00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:20.670
if they know that they're going to,

524
00:29:20.730 --> 00:29:23.640
they're going to have to fight for it and you might lose an eye or a nose.

525
00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:28.920
Dude,
they go,
let's just go over to the [inaudible].
Know what I'm saying?

526
00:29:28.940 --> 00:29:29.710
They'll go,
great,
they'll,

527
00:29:29.710 --> 00:29:31.620
they'll actually leave you on the phone and the other guy,

528
00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:36.010
<v 1>oh,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
What he's saying is that if you're willing to fight,</v>

529
00:29:36.190 --> 00:29:39.880
they won't fuck you and the,
but that's still rape,
dude,
you fought back.

530
00:29:40.180 --> 00:29:42.140
I still rate the other guy who gives him

531
00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:44.470
<v 2>out of fear for his life.
He's getting raped.</v>

532
00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:48.700
I was also watching a prison and the guy was saying this gangster was saying,

533
00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:52.150
Nah,
it's not gay man,
because when you're in prison,
all rules are off.

534
00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:55.000
Know when I get out,
I'm back with my girl.
Yeah.
They call me,

535
00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:58.390
they call it gave for the stage.
Do you remember what Shane Carlin said to me?

536
00:29:58.391 --> 00:30:00.760
I looked at him.
I go,
God,
I gotta look.
And I go,
oh,
well,

537
00:30:00.790 --> 00:30:03.160
I don't even know what I do.
If I had a share a prison cell with you.

538
00:30:03.161 --> 00:30:07.730
And he looked at me and he goes,
you'd suck my cock.
I

539
00:30:10.410 --> 00:30:13.690
remember when he picked me up and start squeezing me and I go,
she goes,
he goes,

540
00:30:13.691 --> 00:30:18.520
in my ear,
he goes,
that's 40% bro.
Yeah.
Another level,
a name mark or I go,

541
00:30:18.660 --> 00:30:22.090
cause he do that to you and Nate goes,
if I let them,
yeah,
it's strong man.

542
00:30:22.090 --> 00:30:24.130
He could squeeze you for death.
The poor guy,

543
00:30:24.131 --> 00:30:26.070
it's really too bad that he had all these injuries,
man.

544
00:30:26.290 --> 00:30:29.410
I have a lot of neck injuries,
a lot of back injuries,
slip ball,
wrestling,

545
00:30:30.070 --> 00:30:34.750
wrestling,
clobbers the Glover.
I'm incredible performance by John Jones.

546
00:30:35.370 --> 00:30:38.710
Smartest shit to that shoulder wrench that he used in the quench.
Amazing.

547
00:30:38.860 --> 00:30:41.200
I've never seen anybody do that before and everyone's going to start doing it

548
00:30:41.201 --> 00:30:43.900
now.
I mean now it's 100% because that comes up all the time.

549
00:30:44.110 --> 00:30:48.520
Guys are copycat league.
I was still in more elbows on Monday.
Sure.

550
00:30:48.550 --> 00:30:51.940
My coach goes,
listen,
I want you to put an elbow pads on now.
You know John,

551
00:30:51.941 --> 00:30:55.190
so good at those two.
In those tight situations.
It doesn't have a,

552
00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:58.540
it doesn't make it an advantage or a disadvantage rather to have long arms when

553
00:30:58.541 --> 00:31:02.770
he's using elbows and he has all the Torque from his mechanical advantage of the

554
00:31:02.771 --> 00:31:03.750
way his body,
his friend,

555
00:31:04.060 --> 00:31:07.270
he's throwing nasty elbows inside the clinch and it's literally the perfect

556
00:31:07.271 --> 00:31:10.730
distance for like full power shots.
Whereas I give you is punching.

557
00:31:10.750 --> 00:31:13.180
You'd have to like get some room in order to punch,

558
00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:17.350
but he's landing these elbows inside and they're just perfect.
What's amazing,

559
00:31:17.351 --> 00:31:22.351
what makes John the best pound for pound fighter in the world right now is you

560
00:31:23.171 --> 00:31:26.230
would think he was just going to sit on the outside and pick glow vertex here

561
00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:28.300
apart and that was the game plan and then he goes,

562
00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:30.430
I just decided to switch it up,

563
00:31:31.150 --> 00:31:36.100
do his game because we thought most experts thought it'd be inside against the,

564
00:31:36.101 --> 00:31:38.250
if it goes inside against the cage,
Glover,

565
00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:41.980
that's where he wants to be is going to tear John Up.
John said,
forget this,

566
00:31:42.250 --> 00:31:44.170
pins him against the cage and just does work.

567
00:31:44.380 --> 00:31:48.490
He did Glover's game plan against him just like he did Charles game plan against

568
00:31:48.491 --> 00:31:52.840
shale.
You know,
it was crazy,
but something I saw you saying something,
uh,

569
00:31:52.870 --> 00:31:57.450
during the,
during the fight was something wrong with his right hand?
No,
never.

570
00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:02.080
Never found out an upper cut,
but that's really,
that's it.
He threw a few.
Oh,

571
00:32:02.081 --> 00:32:05.080
he definitely nothing new.
Nothing like normal.
Right through a lot of laughs.

572
00:32:05.081 --> 00:32:08.330
He threw some nice left hooks to man his left toe check.
Left Hooks.
Yes.

573
00:32:08.650 --> 00:32:11.890
Very nice.
Real accurate.
Left.
Tooks but it was the elbows.

574
00:32:11.891 --> 00:32:14.590
I agree with you up against the cage.
They were the most in my ass.

575
00:32:14.591 --> 00:32:16.920
My feeling is it's going to always be Gustafson.

576
00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:20.350
Gustafson is gonna be number two or whatever.
They're going to battle out again.

577
00:32:20.650 --> 00:32:22.060
And I want to see,
I think the,

578
00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:25.900
the number two spot is up for grabs between Anthony Rumble,

579
00:32:25.901 --> 00:32:30.300
Johnson and Glover to sharer.
Those guys can't sleep on Daniel Cormier.
Man.
Sleep.

580
00:32:30.910 --> 00:32:34.890
That's true.
That's true.
So true.

581
00:32:35.910 --> 00:32:39.070
Tell me something special.
Not About him.
You can't fuck with Daniel Cormier.

582
00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:39.973
He's something special,

583
00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:42.290
<v 4>but is he going to be able to deal with John Jones?</v>

584
00:32:42.340 --> 00:32:44.380
We'll we're going to find out.
That's for damn sure.
Yeah.

585
00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:48.860
I think Daniel Cormier is the most marketable God to fight better wrestler John.

586
00:32:50.190 --> 00:32:52.820
He's not just well Gustafson for sure.
Yeah,
I,
you know,

587
00:32:52.850 --> 00:32:55.040
I'd say it probably even good points,
but I thought,

588
00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:58.210
I mean outside the Gustafson fights guaranteed that's the next fight might be

589
00:32:58.230 --> 00:33:01.880
outside of that.
That's going to be the next fight,
the next fight with,
with,

590
00:33:01.881 --> 00:33:03.470
with John Judge that for sure.

591
00:33:03.471 --> 00:33:07.310
Gustafson took a big chance to and fight and Jimmy Manoa took a big chance.

592
00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:12.980
Yes,
yes.
Yeah.
I mean he,
he beat him and he won.
He Won.
But man was no joke.

593
00:33:13.010 --> 00:33:17.660
Man was fucking dangerous.
He's dangerous.
He's very hard plosive fighter.
However,

594
00:33:18.590 --> 00:33:21.920
it was way too much of a jump for him.
Fight and gusts.
Finn was like,

595
00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:24.380
it was Kinda like,
here's here at Guttman stay act.

596
00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:27.770
That's super easy to say after the fact.
But if Gustafson came in,

597
00:33:27.771 --> 00:33:30.110
he wasn't disciplined.
He doesn't mind his p's and q's.

598
00:33:30.111 --> 00:33:32.420
You wouldn't be where he's at if he was it your true,
you're right.

599
00:33:32.421 --> 00:33:36.320
But sometimes guys will slip when they go from a title fight and they dropped

600
00:33:36.321 --> 00:33:39.770
down the next fight there on the fight card.
But he believed he won the fight.

601
00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:42.740
He's the champ and John says same thing too.

602
00:33:42.741 --> 00:33:45.200
He goes Alexander's talking like he won the fight.

603
00:33:45.710 --> 00:33:49.250
It was a great fight but drop it,
you lost.
It was a very good fight.

604
00:33:49.251 --> 00:33:52.130
But I agree with the decision too.
I agree.
It was a,
it was the right decision.

605
00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:55.120
I John Three to two.
Yeah.
John pulled it out and he pulled it out yet he,

606
00:33:55.140 --> 00:33:58.490
and he gutted it out like a champion in the last rounds but jam Gustafson

607
00:33:58.491 --> 00:34:02.400
fucking held himself.
He held account of himself very well.
John Down,

608
00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:05.840
Dean Gustavson after that fight in the hallway cause I went down to the press

609
00:34:05.841 --> 00:34:10.230
conference and and seeing how beat up he was and then seeing John Edge,

610
00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:13.450
I didn't see John after the fight.
Oh John came through my locker room.
You did.

611
00:34:13.470 --> 00:34:16.490
He,
he was on a stretcher.
Is Body who's trembling?

612
00:34:16.730 --> 00:34:19.130
I actually leaned over and I said,
man,
that was a hell of a fight,
man.

613
00:34:19.131 --> 00:34:23.950
I'm so proud of you.
I mean,
my coach Tony Jeffries,
he came from boxing,
right?

614
00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:27.740
Olympic boxer.
That's the first UFC event he's ever been to,
was cornering me.

615
00:34:27.890 --> 00:34:30.290
He's never been to one.
He's never watched one on TV.

616
00:34:30.380 --> 00:34:33.920
That was the first one he sees John.
He goes,
I've never seen anything like that.

617
00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:38.020
He was,
I would never do this after seeing that.
That's well,

618
00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:40.460
he was pushed to the limit and that fight,
man,
that was the limit.

619
00:34:40.490 --> 00:34:43.610
I mean they both have both those guys hit the wall,
but John just kept pushing.

620
00:34:43.670 --> 00:34:46.790
I'll just a little bit more.
Let me just very close by just a little bit more.

621
00:34:46.850 --> 00:34:51.050
I think the sides,
DC and gusts,
Finn,
I don't see anyone challenging John.

622
00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:54.500
I would like to see what happens with Anthony Rumble Johnson though.
Well,

623
00:34:54.501 --> 00:34:55.070
he's going to fight.

624
00:34:55.070 --> 00:34:59.270
I think the fight between those two is as clover to share I level.
Yeah.

625
00:34:59.370 --> 00:35:04.270
They seem very similar styles.
Glover's hurt.
Glovis shoulder's fucked.

626
00:35:04.910 --> 00:35:09.020
He might have to have surgery.
Yeah,
he's shoulder's fucked up.
The fight,

627
00:35:09.021 --> 00:35:10.870
his arm was straight because he was getting that.

628
00:35:10.890 --> 00:35:14.630
He was getting like that right away from the cage.
First round against the cage.

629
00:35:14.810 --> 00:35:16.240
Talking about the beginning.
He doesn't even listen.

630
00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:18.440
We were talking about the shoulder ranch and he was like,
Hey,

631
00:35:18.441 --> 00:35:20.270
when do I get to talk?
Oh No,

632
00:35:20.271 --> 00:35:21.830
I thought you were talking about the not solar winds.

633
00:35:21.831 --> 00:35:24.730
I thought you were talking about when he,
when he uses his shoulder.
No,
no,
no.

634
00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:25.640
Just submission.

635
00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:27.860
You're talking about when he caught his arm and he yanked at this way,

636
00:35:27.861 --> 00:35:31.460
John grabbed his arm,
they tied up and John grabbed his arm.

637
00:35:31.490 --> 00:35:35.020
That's not it either tied up.
John grabbed his arm going along,

638
00:35:35.210 --> 00:35:38.010
yanked his shoulder up and pop it out and you'd

639
00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:42.300
<v 3>be fucked.
His right arm up dope man.
It was dope.
I love seeing that stuff.</v>

640
00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:44.910
That's so inspiring man.
That's what you were talking about earlier,

641
00:35:44.911 --> 00:35:47.430
that it's a copycat business and you're writing a lot of ways.

642
00:35:47.670 --> 00:35:51.570
The NFL is a copycat business.
So in the NFL,
I'm going to get nerdy on you,

643
00:35:51.571 --> 00:35:54.290
hear some football talk the Tampa too.
So when the uh,

644
00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:57.150
the Tampa Bay Buccaneers won the championship with their defense,

645
00:35:57.270 --> 00:36:00.810
they had a defense called the Tampa to where the middle backer would drop you so

646
00:36:00.811 --> 00:36:03.750
athletic you drop back deep into coverage,
which was rare.

647
00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:06.840
The next year every team was doing it.

648
00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:10.290
Tampa won a championship doing that the next year every team had that defense.

649
00:36:10.410 --> 00:36:13.620
Well now that the offense of figure it out,
no one's doing that anymore.

650
00:36:14.190 --> 00:36:19.170
And the UFC,
same thing.
You see Anthony Pettis using the cage jumping off of it,

651
00:36:19.290 --> 00:36:21.600
we see John Jones stone elbows.
Guess what?

652
00:36:21.750 --> 00:36:25.950
I guarantee you I wasn't the only one working elbows on Monday cause you see how

653
00:36:25.951 --> 00:36:28.830
effective it is and you're like,
okay,
I need to add that to my arsenal.

654
00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:30.540
Remember when the front kick to the face started,

655
00:36:30.541 --> 00:36:34.200
everybody started front cover has to face after.
For Anderson it was pretty rare.

656
00:36:34.310 --> 00:36:37.140
Super Rich.
And then he knocks out,
beat doorbell for within.

657
00:36:37.230 --> 00:36:40.920
And then we see Leono do it to [inaudible] town is proud knocks out,

658
00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:43.980
we'll track down landed for analysis or announcers like,

659
00:36:43.981 --> 00:36:44.890
well what should I do here?

660
00:36:44.891 --> 00:36:49.050
And Pam knocked him out again and that was ridiculous.
Anyways.
Uh Yeah,

661
00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:53.220
so see it's a copycat league.
So we'll kick wheel kicks everything.

662
00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:57.530
Everything man,
relax.
We're good
man.

663
00:36:57.740 --> 00:37:00.450
That's a tough thing.
Of course he regrets regrets it.
Yeah.

664
00:37:00.451 --> 00:37:01.880
Don't let the guy ripped his shoulder.

665
00:37:02.350 --> 00:37:04.470
That was probably had no idea that that was going to happen.

666
00:37:04.470 --> 00:37:05.400
It didn't think about that.

667
00:37:05.401 --> 00:37:09.300
But what was interesting about this fight when you guys were calling it,

668
00:37:09.301 --> 00:37:10.350
and I'm not taking shots here,

669
00:37:10.351 --> 00:37:14.190
but while you guys call it Goldberg use every second was chuck Ladell.

670
00:37:14.191 --> 00:37:17.510
I'd love to see what chocolate l is saying here.
Chuck Ladell.
And he said,

671
00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:20.760
I wonder if chocolate Dell,
how he feels about this fight right now.

672
00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:25.710
Chocolate l thinks he chocolate El Co signed on chocolate out.
I was like,
dammit,

673
00:37:25.711 --> 00:37:28.770
chocolate hell's not fighting right now.
Did he really say a lot of that?

674
00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:32.580
He said a lot of chuck Liddell's.
Did I say any sharks?
I don't think you did.

675
00:37:32.730 --> 00:37:35.550
I'm proud of you.
Okay,
thank you.
I'm proud of you,
man.
Well,
Goldberg,

676
00:37:36.050 --> 00:37:40.420
you know like he has notes.
Yeah,
maybe that's it.
Listen,

677
00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:42.570
talk about it.
Will.
We'll listen.

678
00:37:42.571 --> 00:37:45.120
Trucks when you know one of the most famous fighters of all time,

679
00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:47.040
people that don't know anything about Gloria.

680
00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:49.820
That was like an important point I guess to talk about though.
Well,

681
00:37:49.821 --> 00:37:52.890
it's the folks who didn't know anything.
I agree.
I agree.

682
00:37:52.891 --> 00:37:55.830
You're associating Chuck Ladell with Grover.
Grover is like the new age.

683
00:37:55.831 --> 00:38:00.660
Chuck Ladell I guess.
And then when he picks them apart and John's,
John's done.

684
00:38:00.661 --> 00:38:05.070
Great.
I'm proud of John for this because he's done great answering his critics.

685
00:38:05.071 --> 00:38:06.540
If you've seen some of his Instagram posts,

686
00:38:06.541 --> 00:38:09.210
their classic like Phil Davis talking all that smack.

687
00:38:09.330 --> 00:38:13.560
Let's talk about Phil for a second.
Yeah,
so Dana White says to fill.

688
00:38:13.561 --> 00:38:16.320
If for those of the listeners that don't know,
and probably Brian as well,

689
00:38:16.530 --> 00:38:20.910
Phil Davis wants a title shot and Dana comes out like,
Bro,

690
00:38:20.940 --> 00:38:24.310
you just don't seem like you want for call anyone out.
You're your,
you know,

691
00:38:24.570 --> 00:38:28.080
these rankings,
these bullshit rankings,
these rankings.
You,

692
00:38:28.081 --> 00:38:30.990
you got to make your way.
You got to show me you want it.

693
00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:36.190
So Phil's not the best shit talker in the world.
And he starts doing it.
He did

694
00:38:36.190 --> 00:38:40.720
<v 4>it so much like when they had the press conference,
he was talking shit to John,</v>

695
00:38:40.990 --> 00:38:43.090
not even acknowledge any Anthony Rumble Johnson.

696
00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:46.990
So he's taken a page out of Dana's book trying to get this big title fight.

697
00:38:47.650 --> 00:38:52.570
He goes out and if you watch the fights,
gets Molly wiped by Anthony Johnson.

698
00:38:52.590 --> 00:38:56.290
Not even a fight,
not even a fight.
And now,
I mean,

699
00:38:56.291 --> 00:39:01.240
the criticism he's getting is ridiculous,
but big risk,
big reward.
You know,

700
00:39:01.570 --> 00:39:02.380
what can you do?

701
00:39:02.380 --> 00:39:07.380
So John Jones puts a video up of him watching Phil Davis fine stem or just

702
00:39:07.701 --> 00:39:08.534
throwing idea.

703
00:39:12.260 --> 00:39:14.490
<v 3>Oh,
that's so funny.
It was classic.
That's</v>

704
00:39:16.210 --> 00:39:20.130
<v 4>uh,
no,
I get what Phil's trying to do though,
man.
Let's say he goes out,</v>

705
00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:23.550
let's say he goes out and dominates.
Anthony Johnson gets a quick knockout.

706
00:39:23.910 --> 00:39:28.000
He has a chance that they put them in next in line.
Yaffee dominant.

707
00:39:28.020 --> 00:39:31.020
Anthony Johnson.
But Anthony Johnson is fucking scary.

708
00:39:31.021 --> 00:39:35.040
Fight for a guy at two oh five is scary.
One 85 one 70 not that scary.

709
00:39:36.030 --> 00:39:37.500
He plead himself too much.

710
00:39:37.740 --> 00:39:40.500
He's a poster boy for the point of diminishing returns.

711
00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:42.840
When you deplete yourself so much,
you have no energy left.

712
00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:45.770
<v 3>But I say this all the time.
How does someone not say,</v>

713
00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:50.740
<v 4>hey Anthony,
you're 240 pounds.
You think fight at once.
70 smart,
bro.</v>

714
00:39:50.770 --> 00:39:53.170
Come on man.
You can answer that yourself.
How many times have you told,

715
00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:55.940
you said on this podcast,
I wish someone would've

716
00:39:58.830 --> 00:40:01.870
<v 3>talk to us.
Doesn't happen.
When you asked,</v>

717
00:40:01.871 --> 00:40:06.790
when you asked her for for big Nog in Brazil,
I think it's like your third fight.

718
00:40:06.820 --> 00:40:09.520
Wanted to give me that fight in Denver.
I said,
no,
let's do it in Brazil.

719
00:40:09.521 --> 00:40:12.670
How about that?
Oh my God,
great.
Great decision maker.

720
00:40:13.150 --> 00:40:15.130
Should sit shop down.

721
00:40:15.410 --> 00:40:18.920
<v 4>You understand jet lag,
you know that work.
Do you know about flying in planes?</v>

722
00:40:19.130 --> 00:40:23.840
Fuck that noise.
It's like taking seven x rays.
Not good man.

723
00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:27.670
Knock a couple of days before you fight or flight.
It's a long flight.

724
00:40:27.690 --> 00:40:30.140
Hang out in the stadium for like 10 hours.

725
00:40:31.050 --> 00:40:35.210
Can real here's the fight.
Oh No,
this is his Instagram video.

726
00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:41.060
Anthony Classic blinking.

727
00:40:41.690 --> 00:40:44.420
But the thing is Phil deserves it.
I love Phil.

728
00:40:44.450 --> 00:40:47.910
Well the first one of my favorite people in the business I love fill to just try

729
00:40:47.911 --> 00:40:52.010
and play the game.
He's trying to get people to know I'm not,
I love Phil.

730
00:40:52.100 --> 00:40:54.620
I think that what he's trying to do is get people to pay attention.

731
00:40:54.650 --> 00:40:58.940
You know and it's,
it's sometimes it backfires.
That was a tough fight.

732
00:40:58.941 --> 00:41:02.120
He should have been,
I think that bad matchup.

733
00:41:02.210 --> 00:41:05.390
They also look for you to fail when you start doing something like that.

734
00:41:05.570 --> 00:41:08.790
So if you're doing it before even one,
you're fine.
Like it's,
it's a,

735
00:41:08.791 --> 00:41:11.870
it's a point of return on,
on getting,

736
00:41:11.871 --> 00:41:15.440
it will be less than it would be if you started talking shit after you won.

737
00:41:15.790 --> 00:41:18.890
Like if you're talking shit about getting another fight when you have a fight

738
00:41:18.891 --> 00:41:19.970
coming up against the guy,

739
00:41:19.971 --> 00:41:24.020
cause he's the favorite against you guys are fucking dangerous guy with a lot of

740
00:41:24.021 --> 00:41:27.620
people.
I don't know what the actual fake Johnson was.
The underdog.
I'm not to me,

741
00:41:28.070 --> 00:41:31.670
I didn't know what the hell's going on.
Anthony hits too hard,

742
00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:34.160
but the top 15

743
00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:37.790
<v 3>from one to 1515 Camille,
horrible matchup for number one.</v>

744
00:41:37.791 --> 00:41:41.450
It's a mound styles and spout matchups so Phil Davis,

745
00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:45.770
there cannot be a worse match up from the Nancy Johnson Johnson.
Leo Machida.

746
00:41:45.771 --> 00:41:49.550
What are we talking about?
Some don't think he wanted to.
He won that fight.

747
00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:53.060
It's close though.
He didn't get dominated like he did against Anthony Johnson.

748
00:41:53.061 --> 00:41:54.110
You're absolutely right.

749
00:41:54.111 --> 00:41:57.140
It was a big difference between the images of the bigger underdog.
Yeah.

750
00:41:57.141 --> 00:42:00.770
The Machita fight,
he was,
it was close wide.
That was a close fight.

751
00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:03.410
I just thought,
what do you think it was about?

752
00:42:03.950 --> 00:42:07.700
Was just rumble just to is a monster.
It's just too much of a monster.
Monster.

753
00:42:07.820 --> 00:42:12.020
Rumble's a scary guy.
Yeah,
he's too big tops kid heavyweight.
God,
it's so crazy.

754
00:42:12.021 --> 00:42:13.070
I almost stopped him in the first round.

755
00:42:13.071 --> 00:42:14.900
I broke his John Half and the first round like ours.

756
00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:17.660
I'll ask you fought the last two rounds with the John.

757
00:42:17.660 --> 00:42:20.140
That was shifting up and down cause it was shattered in the side.

758
00:42:20.150 --> 00:42:23.090
Somebody is fighting our last game.
I'm just got some good stories.

759
00:42:23.460 --> 00:42:27.110
When we talk about how guys are hyping fights,

760
00:42:27.620 --> 00:42:31.850
it came back fine like with the metro and fight.
Me and Matt,
uh,

761
00:42:31.851 --> 00:42:34.310
you know we're buddies where we can both talk a little smack.

762
00:42:34.311 --> 00:42:37.310
So it was good to hype the fight talking smack.
It was great.

763
00:42:37.790 --> 00:42:40.700
When you fight legends like Mirko Cro,
cop,
Andrea Lawsky,

764
00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:44.290
big Nog with our Lawsky fans or hit me up on Twitter like,
oh,

765
00:42:44.780 --> 00:42:48.350
I can't wait to see what your smack talk is.
There's no smack talk.

766
00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:53.450
I don't need to talk smack to Andre Arlovski to hype this fight.
He's a legend.

767
00:42:53.540 --> 00:42:56.030
You're not going to win any fans over.
What are you going to say?

768
00:42:56.180 --> 00:42:59.810
What are you going to say?
Oh man,
he fought the very best fighters in the world.

769
00:42:59.810 --> 00:43:01.940
You're a heavyweight champ.
You know what I mean?
What are you going to do?

770
00:43:02.150 --> 00:43:06.430
You gotta be super respectful,
man.
Otherwise they fucking attack like,
well,

771
00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:11.130
the fight sells itself.
But tell him,
tell his story about how,

772
00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:16.130
how you wrote your a training with our Lasky after training where he's,
he goes,

773
00:43:16.131 --> 00:43:18.350
come here.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So,
uh,

774
00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:22.490
Andrea Alaska and I used to train together Jackson's camp and when I was getting

775
00:43:22.491 --> 00:43:27.320
ready for a fight this over shoot almost four years ago,
the two fighters that I,

776
00:43:27.350 --> 00:43:31.760
when I first got into the game that I admired and loved where Mirko Cro cop and

777
00:43:31.761 --> 00:43:35.450
Andrea [inaudible] by two very favorites.
That's who I wanted to be like.

778
00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:39.380
So I walked in the gym and it was our last keys first day at Jackson's too.

779
00:43:39.770 --> 00:43:43.130
And uh,
you know,
when you seen a guy on TV fighting all the time,

780
00:43:43.131 --> 00:43:46.250
then you run into and be like,
damn,
all right.
So I see.
I'm like,
Oh shit,

781
00:43:46.251 --> 00:43:49.610
there's Andre Arlovski.
So then I got shopper last year in the ring,

782
00:43:50.090 --> 00:43:52.940
first day spine,
right,
fresh off the plane when I'm sparring with him.

783
00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:57.400
So me and him are gone and it's,
it's a close round.
He's a bad ass right at here.

784
00:43:57.410 --> 00:44:00.180
We're going back and forth.
People would literally stop and watch a spar.

785
00:44:00.181 --> 00:44:04.520
We're just these dog rounds back and forth,
five rounds in a row there.

786
00:44:04.750 --> 00:44:07.850
And then later that night we grapple.
And then,
uh,

787
00:44:07.890 --> 00:44:10.550
the next morning I drink coffee every morning,
right.

788
00:44:10.580 --> 00:44:13.010
Drinking coffee and out this horrible coffee breath,

789
00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:17.870
breath smell like pure coffee,
shit breath.
Right.
And I'd go up to Andre and he's,

790
00:44:17.871 --> 00:44:21.380
he's not very warm person at all.
Not at all.

791
00:44:21.381 --> 00:44:24.290
Is that very bell reus rush and where it's going to take awhile to be his
friend.

792
00:44:24.291 --> 00:44:28.130
I can tell and I'm trying to break these barriers fan.
I go,
hey bro,

793
00:44:28.140 --> 00:44:31.500
I just want to let you know,
man.
I got the coffee breath and he uh,

794
00:44:31.560 --> 00:44:35.640
he didn't say a word to me the night before training goes,
it's okay.
It's okay.

795
00:44:35.820 --> 00:44:39.490
Much better than yesterday.
Yesterday.
Shit cool.

796
00:44:40.110 --> 00:44:45.060
He goes yesterday,
breath smelled like shit.
Oh,
oh cool man.

797
00:44:45.090 --> 00:44:46.740
Cool.
And then just went about our business.

798
00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:49.080
That was really the only words he ever said to me,
man.

799
00:44:49.150 --> 00:44:51.320
And we trained together for a while.
It wasn't even like,

800
00:44:51.870 --> 00:44:55.020
what about when you were kicking,
when he had you kick his body?
Yeah.

801
00:44:55.030 --> 00:44:57.900
And then we get done training.
I've never done this.
He goes,

802
00:44:58.740 --> 00:45:00.350
I'm trying to do my best Russian accent it.

803
00:45:00.351 --> 00:45:03.210
You guys are pretty much terrible Russian.
That's horrible.
Right?
Well sorry,

804
00:45:03.211 --> 00:45:06.150
I'm not from Russia.
The bus,
he goes up,
he goes,

805
00:45:06.151 --> 00:45:08.730
put your hands on top of your head like this.
And I'm like,
what are we doing?

806
00:45:08.731 --> 00:45:10.410
And we just got done sparring.
I'm exhausted.

807
00:45:10.710 --> 00:45:15.510
I put my hands up and he just goes braced herself and starts wailing at my body.

808
00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:20.520
Why?
With kicks punches Waylon.
It was this,
this make you tough.

809
00:45:20.700 --> 00:45:24.480
My okay.
And I'm like,
ah,
I'm trying to be tough though.
Cause he's my hair.

810
00:45:24.481 --> 00:45:28.230
I'm like,
oh,
okay.
Wow.
And then he goes,
my turn,

811
00:45:28.231 --> 00:45:30.540
you do it to me and I'm like doing,
he goes,
no,

812
00:45:30.541 --> 00:45:35.280
you hit like girl hit and I'm fucking trying man.
Trying to hurt this guy.

813
00:45:35.490 --> 00:45:39.060
Nothing.
And that was my experience with Andrea [inaudible].
Oh no man.

814
00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:43.200
And now you're got to fight him for years.
Now I've got to find him how I was a,

815
00:45:43.201 --> 00:45:47.330
I was sitting on the beach and I get a call from Lex Mcmahon,
my mangoes,

816
00:45:47.990 --> 00:45:50.430
burrow,
and whenever he calls me multiple times,

817
00:45:50.431 --> 00:45:52.890
cause I rarely answer whenever we calls him multiple times,
you know,

818
00:45:52.891 --> 00:45:56.490
you got to fight.
He calls me guy,
whatever,
ignore calls again,
ignoring.
I'm like,

819
00:45:56.491 --> 00:46:01.440
Oh shit,
we got some answer.
I'm like,
what's up man?
He goes,
Amigo,

820
00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:05.400
we got to fight.
Like,
yeah,
hunt,
hunt.

821
00:46:05.401 --> 00:46:09.870
Finally fricking saddled up and sign the contract.
He goes,
nope,

822
00:46:10.170 --> 00:46:13.200
we used to be your hair.
I'll go get the fuck outta here.

823
00:46:13.201 --> 00:46:16.810
I knew right away I knew what they reassigned Andrea [inaudible].
Yep.

824
00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:21.600
And I done.
He,
I was like done.
When is it?
He was seven weeks.
Cool.

825
00:46:21.660 --> 00:46:26.610
Let's do it.
Vancouver June 14th,
UFC one 74 going down.

826
00:46:26.730 --> 00:46:31.710
Don't,
don't,
don't Dan.
And she gets real,
left the beach straight to the gym.

827
00:46:31.711 --> 00:46:34.080
So today we just decided,
slept like shit last night.

828
00:46:34.540 --> 00:46:36.540
Brian is going to join me on those,
uh,

829
00:46:36.570 --> 00:46:39.020
those dates so that he could be there with his boyfriend,
the kids,

830
00:46:40.470 --> 00:46:43.890
my date in Vancouver and Lloydminster Bolt of those,

831
00:46:43.891 --> 00:46:47.580
Brian Cowen and Tony Hinchcliffe is coming to session fun.
Oh,
by the way,

832
00:46:47.581 --> 00:46:51.510
I'll be at the Calusa casino tomorrow and then I'll be,
where's that?

833
00:46:51.690 --> 00:46:56.160
Edmonton and and Toronto this month.
I'm going to Ryan,

834
00:46:56.161 --> 00:46:59.130
count.com.
Brian Cowen.
Yuck.
Yuck.

835
00:46:59.160 --> 00:47:03.570
How many fighters in the kid you guys doing a week,
but just one.
Do one a week.

836
00:47:03.571 --> 00:47:08.040
When are going to break free from the teat of big business?
Very soon.

837
00:47:09.180 --> 00:47:13.500
Very soon.
We're killed it,
man.
What?
It's doing well over there.
Awesome.
Yeah.

838
00:47:13.560 --> 00:47:16.770
Good pocket.
We're trying.
It's funny.
What'd you think about the rest of the card?

839
00:47:16.860 --> 00:47:21.210
The rest of the EOC?
Ah,
I thought Joe a joy.
Benevidez like,
great.
Fuck.
Yeah.

840
00:47:21.240 --> 00:47:24.900
I haven't seen a guy tap with his feet like that.
Dope.
Right.

841
00:47:24.901 --> 00:47:25.800
All the years of the UFC.

842
00:47:25.801 --> 00:47:29.410
I don't think there was another time where a guy tapped his feet like that from

843
00:47:29.411 --> 00:47:30.280
a mouse.
A joke.

844
00:47:31.060 --> 00:47:35.170
<v 4>The joke constrict Joa constructing was tight.
It was nasty,
super tight,</v>

845
00:47:35.171 --> 00:47:39.880
full mount with both arms trapped inside and a gay teen.
Pretty wild.

846
00:47:40.210 --> 00:47:41.740
It's pretty wild technique.
I'll tell you.

847
00:47:41.950 --> 00:47:45.000
I'll tell you who I came away probably besides John Jones off.

848
00:47:45.001 --> 00:47:46.330
So you just destroyed Glover.

849
00:47:46.331 --> 00:47:49.270
But the guy who looked the best to me it was Luke Rockhold.
Yeah,

850
00:47:49.310 --> 00:47:53.200
the guys at diabetes to look real good.
He's a handsome dude.
Hansel bastard.

851
00:47:53.970 --> 00:47:55.360
I got him over you and I apologize.

852
00:47:55.361 --> 00:47:59.420
Hard to believe that it really weighs a buck 85 like when you stand tall,
right?

853
00:47:59.430 --> 00:48:02.110
He's like such as call scrawny guy.

854
00:48:02.490 --> 00:48:06.850
He's not like a thin one 85 you could see him eventually deciding that he

855
00:48:06.851 --> 00:48:09.820
doesn't want to make that weight anymore and going up to two oh five cause I

856
00:48:09.821 --> 00:48:12.610
don't know how old he is.
How old is he?
Is Less than 30 right?

857
00:48:14.040 --> 00:48:18.880
31 zero fucking guys surface.
A surfer who just came to Aka Aka and was like,

858
00:48:18.881 --> 00:48:21.010
let's do this.
That reverse triangle was dope.

859
00:48:21.080 --> 00:48:23.850
I thought he was gonna go for the arm earlier though.
Yeah,

860
00:48:23.910 --> 00:48:26.260
well nobody's doing his patient.
He didn't want to lose the position,

861
00:48:26.500 --> 00:48:28.350
but he also was going to lose it though.

862
00:48:28.640 --> 00:48:32.710
29 he did a really good job of making sure that,
uh,

863
00:48:32.740 --> 00:48:36.130
he got that the side up,
got him on his side,
didn't let him flatten out.

864
00:48:36.370 --> 00:48:40.000
Guys will try to flatten out and try to protect the Camorra and he made sure he

865
00:48:40.001 --> 00:48:43.390
got him yanked up to a side that triangles nasty to triangles.
Nasty.

866
00:48:43.391 --> 00:48:46.180
It's tough to finish from there.
You've really hard.
It's very tough.

867
00:48:46.181 --> 00:48:48.520
It's very hard to finish with the triangle.
It's,
that's what I'm saying,

868
00:48:48.521 --> 00:48:51.910
the triangle to finish that reverse drank like that's very tough.

869
00:48:51.911 --> 00:48:56.770
Braulio he's rather steam was nasty with it.
Have you ever rode with him?

870
00:48:56.771 --> 00:48:57.604
No,
I have not.

871
00:49:00.330 --> 00:49:01.930
Got a very weird style.

872
00:49:01.931 --> 00:49:06.280
That duck under style of attacking that inverted triangle.
He's got,
he,
you know,

873
00:49:06.281 --> 00:49:09.040
he has an artificial disc in his neck.
I didn't know that.
Yeah,
there's,

874
00:49:09.041 --> 00:49:09.860
there's a benefit.

875
00:49:09.860 --> 00:49:14.050
It's look how dope trapped in arching his back.

876
00:49:14.680 --> 00:49:17.520
It's like a guard from the mouth.
That guard.

877
00:49:17.830 --> 00:49:21.720
A lot of guys are doing their guard like that in their mouth,
their mouth.

878
00:49:21.730 --> 00:49:24.810
They're crossing their feet under lake guard.
Yeah,

879
00:49:24.880 --> 00:49:28.570
but under the body and the actual body and if you have like a really good strong

880
00:49:28.571 --> 00:49:31.360
tight guard and you do that from the mount boy you,

881
00:49:31.390 --> 00:49:35.100
you fucking sat the will out of a guy because you take away a lot of breath.

882
00:49:35.180 --> 00:49:37.210
You when you really clamped down on it.
I'm like that.

883
00:49:37.211 --> 00:49:38.860
It's very hard for them to breathe in.

884
00:49:38.861 --> 00:49:43.050
A lot of guys freak out when you get an amount that mount like that.

885
00:49:43.670 --> 00:49:47.020
You look at Benevidez how much arc he's putting in there and how much torque.

886
00:49:47.080 --> 00:49:49.600
That's an expert blackbelt mount.
He's a,

887
00:49:49.630 --> 00:49:52.510
he's a beast and then you see other guys mounts where they're like kind of

888
00:49:52.511 --> 00:49:55.540
sloppy,
very loose.
There's no pressure.

889
00:49:55.780 --> 00:49:59.230
Benevidez is just crunching.
It's a perfect name.
The JOA constrictor.

890
00:49:59.231 --> 00:50:03.390
It's a perfect game.
I love that.
He's a great guy too.
One of the best man.

891
00:50:04.170 --> 00:50:08.520
He's cool.
He's funny.
He's a,
he's a good dude.
Yeah,

892
00:50:08.530 --> 00:50:10.090
it was interesting watching that.

893
00:50:10.091 --> 00:50:13.730
So we start good Jujitsu technique and then Jim Miller caught Yancey Madeiros

894
00:50:13.731 --> 00:50:17.320
and that the creatine and put them to sleep and then was celebrating why was

895
00:50:17.321 --> 00:50:21.550
underneath him first time ever guys on top of you unconscious and Miller was

896
00:50:21.551 --> 00:50:24.360
solid skill ref get them off man.
Crazy.

897
00:50:24.730 --> 00:50:29.730
Jim Miller's Jujitsu is ridiculous is you see him submit for BCO cowboys with an

898
00:50:29.901 --> 00:50:32.830
arm bar,
high levels.

899
00:50:33.180 --> 00:50:36.830
Highballs slipped it in there like a glove.
And he was like,
what?

900
00:50:36.860 --> 00:50:39.500
I can't believe this.
You could see like when the arm bar was locked up,

901
00:50:39.720 --> 00:50:42.800
it'll look in,
come on his face like he's a Hoya Gracie black belt.
She's like,

902
00:50:42.801 --> 00:50:46.250
I can't believe I'm getting submitted by an American.
Oh you motherfucker.

903
00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:51.650
[inaudible] Silva.
John Silva knocked out,
uh,
Eric Silver.

904
00:50:51.651 --> 00:50:56.450
You're talking to mark silver.
But if you ever see don young him knock him out.

905
00:50:56.560 --> 00:51:01.540
Yes,
Don Young Kid,
man.
You know Kim is a beast.
Yes he is,

906
00:51:02.600 --> 00:51:04.340
but he's still young.
He comes out of black house,

907
00:51:04.341 --> 00:51:06.560
but it seems like he's got all the talent in the world and he's just,
he,

908
00:51:06.730 --> 00:51:10.460
you know,
cause he rushed.
I think he just got who,
Eric.
No,
he didn't know.

909
00:51:10.461 --> 00:51:14.000
He's just,
he's been tested by Fitch.
Fitch beat him in a decision.

910
00:51:14.120 --> 00:51:15.800
He's been in there with some really good guys.

911
00:51:15.830 --> 00:51:18.460
He's got a lot of potential and he's definitely getting better.
But there's no,

912
00:51:20.210 --> 00:51:22.220
every week everyone's a black belt in that.

913
00:51:22.221 --> 00:51:27.140
Like I say at 1505170140 five you're basically a blackbelt.
Everything,

914
00:51:27.210 --> 00:51:30.470
every lacking,
anything else you're going to get.
So competitive.

915
00:51:30.510 --> 00:51:34.880
The top 20 you're going to expose Elvis.
Elvis is back,

916
00:51:35.330 --> 00:51:37.510
came out,
guns blazing,
took two years off,

917
00:51:37.530 --> 00:51:41.330
looked like he never missed a step leg kicks with.
Oh,
it's beautiful technique.

918
00:51:41.750 --> 00:51:44.310
I held a pad for Taga when he was kicking.
Show me how to,

919
00:51:44.370 --> 00:51:49.040
how to kick and I held a pad and he just kind of laid in with some kicks,

920
00:51:49.041 --> 00:51:53.210
like some low kicks to the legs.
I was shocked.
It was shocking.

921
00:51:53.450 --> 00:51:56.810
It was shocking how strong his leg,
his big,
strong as all that good.

922
00:51:56.811 --> 00:52:00.140
But it's great.
But his technique is what's so beautiful.

923
00:52:00.560 --> 00:52:05.360
He throws that straight,
right?
Right leg kick and that left hook,
right leg kick.

924
00:52:05.361 --> 00:52:10.040
And it's fucking devastating.
His timing is so perfect.
He rarely gets checked.

925
00:52:10.310 --> 00:52:13.370
If you watch like the amount of guys that get the legs kicked checked versus the

926
00:52:13.371 --> 00:52:14.810
amount of times that guys land them.

927
00:52:14.990 --> 00:52:18.570
There's some guys that are just uncanny at landing them and not getting checked.

928
00:52:18.571 --> 00:52:21.820
Tiago is one of the best.
Although all those,
all those fantastic,

929
00:52:21.821 --> 00:52:25.820
you'd be the best.
Barao was fantastic.
Round Morales mass guys.

930
00:52:26.090 --> 00:52:29.450
Brown can fuck you up with anything so you can fuck you up with a long punch.

931
00:52:29.451 --> 00:52:31.310
Fuck you up in the background.
It did.

932
00:52:31.311 --> 00:52:34.880
He book people don't realize Borow is our Floyd Mayweather.

933
00:52:35.450 --> 00:52:38.630
The guy hasn't lost him forever but he does have one loss.

934
00:52:38.631 --> 00:52:41.360
He does Floyd Mayweather.
Floyd Mayweather is undefeated.

935
00:52:41.450 --> 00:52:45.440
Stay in MMA though but in MMA to have one loss at a pretty impressive

936
00:52:47.720 --> 00:52:50.210
background.
No,
I know,
but what does his background as far as like,

937
00:52:50.230 --> 00:52:51.290
cause he's a novel and young guy.

938
00:52:51.291 --> 00:52:55.650
He's a Jujitsu black belt who got into a MMA posing tie.

939
00:52:56.140 --> 00:52:59.990
His jujitsu's worldclass is his fucking striking is fantastic.

940
00:53:00.010 --> 00:53:02.750
Writing is so good.
That's like,
it's the same.
He trains at all though.
So,

941
00:53:02.751 --> 00:53:06.250
I mean it's,
it helps to have a fuck.
Yeah.
You know,
it's kind of like quite soon.

942
00:53:06.260 --> 00:53:09.710
Training partner is,
is a Cain Velasquez as you know.
It's fine.
Tj Dillashaw,

943
00:53:09.740 --> 00:53:13.760
Tj Dillashaw and him are fighting in May very well.
Do you think of that fight?

944
00:53:14.200 --> 00:53:17.330
Tj Dillashaw is a tough kid.
He's a really good athlete.
He's a,

945
00:53:17.331 --> 00:53:20.540
a really good fighter.
Is a big step up at giant step up.
I mean,

946
00:53:20.541 --> 00:53:22.010
I think he's improved without a doubt.

947
00:53:22.011 --> 00:53:24.360
Over the last couple of rounds we're going to have some fun.

948
00:53:25.230 --> 00:53:28.830
It's a lot to chew off.
Browse.
No joke.
He might be the best.
It's like there's,

949
00:53:28.860 --> 00:53:32.280
there's three guys,
four guys that are contention for being the best.

950
00:53:32.281 --> 00:53:35.700
And number one is John Jones in my opinion,
the way he shuts guys down.

951
00:53:35.701 --> 00:53:37.870
Everybody except Gustafson Gustafson fight was,

952
00:53:38.110 --> 00:53:40.320
I think Gustafson's fucking fantastic.
I think,
you know,

953
00:53:40.321 --> 00:53:41.154
I don't think there's any,

954
00:53:41.190 --> 00:53:44.130
any slight on John because the gossips and fight was close.
I think it's just,

955
00:53:44.131 --> 00:53:46.770
cause gossips is not good.
But if you see what he did to glow over,

956
00:53:46.890 --> 00:53:51.880
see what he did to rampage.
You see what he did to Machida.
Who else does Dominic?

957
00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:55.350
Who else get,
I mean he caught also caught by an arm bar and the veto or fight,

958
00:53:55.351 --> 00:53:59.320
let his arm hyperextended his still won the fight he got his arm is bent and his

959
00:53:59.321 --> 00:54:02.910
whole body,
I mean that was the craziest arm bar I've ever,
I mean,
it was nasty.

960
00:54:03.360 --> 00:54:06.270
It was a nasty,
beautiful,
perfect.
Armbar and John's still didn't tap.

961
00:54:06.770 --> 00:54:07.710
A lot of guys would have tapped.

962
00:54:07.770 --> 00:54:10.260
A lot of guys would have tapped his arm was pretty fuck for a long time.

963
00:54:10.261 --> 00:54:11.700
I plus it makes sense.

964
00:54:11.760 --> 00:54:15.870
Fucked up his toe when he fought Chell son in snap that bench and rolled it
over.

965
00:54:16.330 --> 00:54:19.260
Yeah.
I mean if he didn't stop channel in that first round,
that fight was over.

966
00:54:19.590 --> 00:54:23.190
His toe is useless.
Bone was sticking out.
It was twist around a circle.

967
00:54:23.370 --> 00:54:26.640
It was all dislocated and turned the wrong way.
It was fucked up,
man.

968
00:54:26.641 --> 00:54:29.510
He's John's the beast.
He's an animal.
The best we all do.

969
00:54:29.790 --> 00:54:32.820
It's all going to go up to 55 I think he's going to have to,

970
00:54:32.850 --> 00:54:34.530
I honestly think that that holds Aldo back.

971
00:54:34.531 --> 00:54:36.930
I think it's like a rumble Johnson type way.
Yeah,

972
00:54:37.080 --> 00:54:39.240
I think it's a rumble Johnson type thing and we were talking about that.

973
00:54:39.270 --> 00:54:42.660
What else is with formats 45 though?
Well there's a lot of guys,

974
00:54:42.690 --> 00:54:45.750
Cub Swanson for one,
he's got the title though.
That's the big thing.

975
00:54:45.780 --> 00:54:47.490
It doesn't matter.
He beat cop with one knee,

976
00:54:47.790 --> 00:54:52.620
one flying knee back in the WEC days and cubs saved east cubs.

977
00:54:52.621 --> 00:54:54.330
The most tactic I've ever seen in the training room.

978
00:54:54.570 --> 00:54:56.460
I think carbon cub is a real threat.

979
00:54:56.490 --> 00:54:58.200
I think customer never seen anything like it.

980
00:54:58.230 --> 00:55:02.340
Real literally a real life Ninja really.
He was sparring and I was just like,

981
00:55:02.610 --> 00:55:05.700
it's rare.
I stopped and watch guys and amazed and I was watching them.

982
00:55:05.701 --> 00:55:07.980
It's like Dang.
Just cause his ability to come in and out.

983
00:55:07.981 --> 00:55:10.130
He's kind of an awesome cavity.

984
00:55:10.140 --> 00:55:13.710
The creativity you had was like nothing I've ever seen.
Wow.

985
00:55:13.800 --> 00:55:17.460
And he hasn't even unleashed all of it yet.
He's still not to that level.

986
00:55:17.650 --> 00:55:19.440
Wait till he unleashes it.
However,

987
00:55:19.680 --> 00:55:22.950
although I think there's bigger matchups at 55 I think you're right.

988
00:55:22.951 --> 00:55:26.280
And I think that he would probably be better served physically at 55 I think

989
00:55:26.281 --> 00:55:27.750
it's really hard for him to make that weight.

990
00:55:28.020 --> 00:55:31.290
So like you see the Aldo Aldo will come out guns blazing and the first few

991
00:55:31.291 --> 00:55:31.890
rounds,

992
00:55:31.890 --> 00:55:34.890
but then he realizes he's not going to get a guy out of there if he thinks he

993
00:55:34.891 --> 00:55:37.420
might not be able to get a guy out of there,
it's just going to beat him up.
Well,

994
00:55:37.421 --> 00:55:39.840
you know,
he'll start to pay the coast,
you know?

995
00:55:39.841 --> 00:55:42.840
And I think the reason why he does that most likely is because the fact that

996
00:55:42.841 --> 00:55:45.750
he's cutting down from a lot of weight and he's probably walking around over one

997
00:55:45.751 --> 00:55:49.560
seven and he's getting down to one 45 it's crazy.
And he's a lean guy,
you know?

998
00:55:49.800 --> 00:55:52.290
I mean,
I don't,
I don't know.
Is that exact walking around weight?

999
00:55:52.320 --> 00:55:56.970
I would ask him how tall I was pretty fat.
No,
it was very,
very,

1000
00:55:57.240 --> 00:56:01.410
very muscular.
But he's so God damn good.
His left hook right leg.
So good,

1001
00:56:01.411 --> 00:56:02.500
smoothest and quickest.

1002
00:56:02.770 --> 00:56:07.380
And who does he have the most trouble with in 55 Serone or no,
no,

1003
00:56:07.590 --> 00:56:09.940
I mean he's got some great fights.
Who knows who,

1004
00:56:09.941 --> 00:56:13.650
who's going to have a hard time with it at 55 55 would be amazing to find that

1005
00:56:13.651 --> 00:56:17.820
55 he still has a possible rematch,
a Chad Mendez at 45 that can be,

1006
00:56:17.910 --> 00:56:21.210
that's going to be interesting for.
Although though it's like why do that?

1007
00:56:21.211 --> 00:56:24.430
What's it do for you?
Money.
That's it.
I agree.
All right,

1008
00:56:24.431 --> 00:56:26.350
so then you going to go super fights.
You want make real money,

1009
00:56:26.370 --> 00:56:31.180
you'll see 55 yeah,
55 and pedis was [inaudible] was supposed to,
yeah,

1010
00:56:31.270 --> 00:56:33.940
I was supposed to happen.
Right.
But pennys has had some injuries.

1011
00:56:33.941 --> 00:56:36.070
He's had some injuries.
I mean these guys get banged up.

1012
00:56:36.071 --> 00:56:38.950
Pet is just had knee surgery,
so that's going to be a while before he gets there.

1013
00:56:38.951 --> 00:56:40.270
I'll tell you what,
uh,

1014
00:56:40.290 --> 00:56:45.290
is going to be huge for the UFC and just for heavyweights in general is Cain

1015
00:56:45.340 --> 00:56:49.690
Velasquez versus Fabrizio for doom in Mexico.
Sosh that's going to be Mexico.

1016
00:56:49.691 --> 00:56:54.640
Otherwise for Risa,
resume speaks perfect Spanish.
Perfect.
Literally the UFC,

1017
00:56:54.641 --> 00:56:58.630
it couldn't be more perfect.
Came versus the reseal.

1018
00:56:58.720 --> 00:57:02.830
Reseal speaks better Spanish then Cain.
Yeah.

1019
00:57:04.030 --> 00:57:07.060
So they're fighting in Mexico and they have these two as the tough coaches.

1020
00:57:07.270 --> 00:57:10.440
I mean literally picture perfect for the UFC.
Yeah.
And Dude,
how,

1021
00:57:10.441 --> 00:57:13.890
how good it Fabrizio duck look against travelers praising.
That was amazing.
His,

1022
00:57:14.050 --> 00:57:17.010
his Double Jab,
double jabs,
triple,
just so inspiring.

1023
00:57:17.550 --> 00:57:22.550
And so he looked at her and punching and looking the other way and matching kick

1024
00:57:22.961 --> 00:57:27.850
for Kik and kept up to his feet and then kicked him in the body back trying to

1025
00:57:27.851 --> 00:57:30.640
get them to come to his guards and like just like matrix.

1026
00:57:31.070 --> 00:57:33.190
He kept stopping and throw the body France,

1027
00:57:33.191 --> 00:57:37.210
just cotton by the way to come back after all that time and be that confident

1028
00:57:37.240 --> 00:57:40.390
and it'd be looking like you're having fun and just,
you know,

1029
00:57:40.470 --> 00:57:44.060
having to go through a fucking dangerous moment in that first round at first run

1030
00:57:44.061 --> 00:57:47.410
was super dangerous.
Trash bag might be.
Yeah,
one of the most dangerous.

1031
00:57:47.740 --> 00:57:51.310
Was he talking to him?
Joe,
you were there.
Was he talking to him?

1032
00:57:51.460 --> 00:57:54.770
He was taunting him.
What was he saying?
Telling him you're cut.
Cut,
cut.

1033
00:57:55.150 --> 00:57:58.510
Cut this open.
Yeah.
They pop them again with a jab.

1034
00:57:59.110 --> 00:58:02.410
Really telling them to do was cut and he's kicking his legs and kicking his body

1035
00:58:02.580 --> 00:58:05.690
wasn't kicking his legs too much.
Actually I can think of,
I think a lot of smart,

1036
00:58:06.370 --> 00:58:10.510
he sang about uh,
Yoel Romero.
It looks so amazing.
He's a freak man.

1037
00:58:10.511 --> 00:58:12.850
He's a phrasing other one.
That's a real challenge.

1038
00:58:12.851 --> 00:58:17.800
At one 85 I got to be Kale Sanderson twice.
Yeah.
You know,
he's incredible.

1039
00:58:17.820 --> 00:58:21.070
Yeah.
And he's a world champion.
Weight throws dudes around.

1040
00:58:21.071 --> 00:58:23.320
It's just so he started using his wrestling finally.
Yeah.

1041
00:58:24.170 --> 00:58:26.530
Boy He was in Cuba and Europe and stuff.

1042
00:58:26.531 --> 00:58:29.110
The reason that like international rest is a lot of times beat Americans,

1043
00:58:29.111 --> 00:58:31.640
Americans or freestyle collegiate wrestling.

1044
00:58:31.960 --> 00:58:35.810
And in Europe they start more from the clench.
They do a lot of Greco,

1045
00:58:35.811 --> 00:58:39.250
so they're clinches way back.
So when you fight it internationally like that,

1046
00:58:39.390 --> 00:58:41.050
when you wrestle internationally,
it's very different.

1047
00:58:41.051 --> 00:58:42.970
So you tie it with a guy like Yoel Romero.

1048
00:58:43.240 --> 00:58:46.540
Good luck dealing with that Greco dude.
Good luck dealing with those throws,

1049
00:58:46.750 --> 00:58:50.050
but it's not just that.
The other thing about that guy is his striking.

1050
00:58:50.470 --> 00:58:55.350
He hits and he's so fast.
He has been striking.
How long?

1051
00:58:55.360 --> 00:58:58.480
I mean that's a nice,
please see him and Hector lumbar fight each other.

1052
00:58:58.481 --> 00:59:00.880
They train together,
they trained their different weaknesses.

1053
00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:03.460
You all's been fighting 85 in Lombard is way better at once.

1054
00:59:03.610 --> 00:59:08.200
Just cut it at 70 yes.
Yeah,
I like him look great below lumbar dude.

1055
00:59:08.201 --> 00:59:11.020
His judo is ridiculous.
Those fucking throws it.
He had Jake shields,

1056
00:59:11.430 --> 00:59:15.050
nobody have a rag dolls.
Jake shields like that.
I ever Netflix a pro.

1057
00:59:15.110 --> 00:59:19.000
You'd never see that.
That's just what a freak.
Yo that Hector lumbar.

1058
00:59:19.030 --> 00:59:22.040
Yes they all were married was a free clinic.
And what real y'all with?

1059
00:59:22.640 --> 00:59:26.540
<v 1>Well Brad to vars.
Is it legit?
You know Brad tomorrow.
It's a very tough kid.</v>

1060
00:59:27.250 --> 00:59:30.520
Is it dangerous striker and you know the Derek Brunson fight?

1061
00:59:30.521 --> 00:59:34.730
Derek Brunson head kicked you over American down twice but he had kicked him

1062
00:59:34.880 --> 00:59:36.740
like picture perfect.
Well,

1063
00:59:37.490 --> 00:59:39.530
like it was like it was a piece of toast with butter on it,

1064
00:59:40.710 --> 00:59:44.210
which is still bouncing around like nothing had happened.

1065
00:59:44.240 --> 00:59:47.810
He looks like a superhero.
Like his body's so written moves like the,

1066
00:59:47.811 --> 00:59:52.590
when he covers distance here.
Like what the fuck is nine Paul?
36 yeah.

1067
00:59:52.880 --> 00:59:57.410
Yeah.
He's not young.
I believe he's 36 he's a slowed down at all.

1068
00:59:57.411 --> 01:00:01.220
It doesn't look 37 actually.
It doesn't look like it means anything.

1069
01:00:01.430 --> 01:00:03.920
I bet you it does though.
I bet.
I bet you it does.

1070
01:00:03.940 --> 01:00:07.490
I bet you in the right you mean or I bet recovery.
I bet he can't train as long.

1071
01:00:07.490 --> 01:00:11.540
I bet.
I bet to him.
Look at that.
Good Lord Jesus Christ.

1072
01:00:11.570 --> 01:00:14.900
Can you go over here?
I'll Tiago Alvarez,
bro.

1073
01:00:15.590 --> 01:00:20.590
That is Tro Romeo back in the day.

1074
01:00:21.320 --> 01:00:24.300
That looks like Tiago.
It looks like he's got a belt on too.
Like swearing,

1075
01:00:24.390 --> 01:00:25.790
like work shorts.

1076
01:00:26.030 --> 01:00:30.270
I mean he's wearing or May to war it say,
well,

1077
01:00:31.250 --> 01:00:34.040
he's got a weird look on his face.
Look,
he looks like Tiago doesn't any does.

1078
01:00:34.050 --> 01:00:37.240
He does.
Let's find another picture of him.
We actually see what he looks like,

1079
01:00:37.250 --> 01:00:38.370
but he's that redundant,

1080
01:00:38.630 --> 01:00:43.630
elite athletic guy like that at 36 and I've talking to some other guys who were

1081
01:00:44.021 --> 01:00:48.650
a little old on Jesus Christ.
Good Lord.

1082
01:00:49.160 --> 01:00:49.640
He looks,

1083
01:00:49.640 --> 01:00:53.360
he looks that he's more muscular than the wolverine in the cartoons and the

1084
01:00:53.361 --> 01:00:56.270
cartoons,
but he looks like a cartoon that barely,
it looks like a real guy.

1085
01:00:56.300 --> 01:00:58.550
But for guys at 36 and have that background,

1086
01:00:58.551 --> 01:01:01.040
and I'm sure there's injuries we don't know about.
There's a,

1087
01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:04.550
there's a timing sensitivity with him.
You know what I'm saying?

1088
01:01:04.551 --> 01:01:07.910
Like they're not gonna lose two in a row and be like,
well,

1089
01:01:07.911 --> 01:01:11.570
got to get back on the horse.
Let's do this.
Right on,
man.
He's going there.

1090
01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:15.110
He wants to get those big fights.
Oh,
no doubt.
And not only that,

1091
01:01:15.111 --> 01:01:18.800
like stylistically think about matching him up with Chris Weidman.
I mean,

1092
01:01:18.830 --> 01:01:22.340
why would it turn up for a striking and Weidman's known for his wrestling?

1093
01:01:22.341 --> 01:01:23.510
I think he went on for Polk,

1094
01:01:23.540 --> 01:01:27.610
but who wants to wrestle that kind of nobody who wants to strike with the back?

1095
01:01:27.630 --> 01:01:29.360
Well,
I'll tell you what's tough.
I have.

1096
01:01:29.400 --> 01:01:31.610
I think this is where Weidman's Gabby advantage.

1097
01:01:31.611 --> 01:01:35.140
If Weidman mixes up and dragged them into later rounds,
maybe,
I don't know.

1098
01:01:35.470 --> 01:01:37.940
That's what I'm saying.
That's your only hope.
Only hope.
We don't know.

1099
01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:42.550
He controls fighter.
He controls fight so well that you,

1100
01:01:42.551 --> 01:01:44.060
you know what people say that he gets tired.

1101
01:01:44.180 --> 01:01:47.480
But the thing is he's just so relaxed in there and when he really takes

1102
01:01:47.481 --> 01:01:51.800
advantage of anybody move in a certain way,
well he explode so much.

1103
01:01:52.030 --> 01:01:54.020
And any of those guys that explode that much,

1104
01:01:54.021 --> 01:01:57.470
those guys get tired quicker than a guy like Nick Diaz who just keeps going at

1105
01:01:57.471 --> 01:01:58.304
the same pace.

1106
01:01:58.340 --> 01:02:02.810
Those guys were up and being worn out in the middle of the octagon against scary

1107
01:02:02.811 --> 01:02:06.290
guy is a terrifying place to be.
So everybody keeps pushing.
He's tired.

1108
01:02:06.291 --> 01:02:08.770
He can target getting tired.
Like that's what,
when,

1109
01:02:08.790 --> 01:02:11.900
when he was fighting this past weekend,
Brad to Vars,
his corner,

1110
01:02:12.020 --> 01:02:14.450
Ray Sefo was telling them that it's you guys tired.
He's tired,
he's tired,

1111
01:02:14.451 --> 01:02:17.060
he's tired.
He wasn't really wasn't that tired.
They didn't look that tired.

1112
01:02:17.170 --> 01:02:20.960
But that's what she gonna say.
You're the corner.
So you got,
you got to bake,

1113
01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.970
you gotta Bank on that.
You got to say,
you got to knock this mother fucker out,

1114
01:02:24.450 --> 01:02:28.740
void him at all costs and then sneak attack.
We Cook Ramzi Shit.

1115
01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:33.930
But the reality of the situation is not good.
Okay,
let's throw out the window.

1116
01:02:33.990 --> 01:02:38.520
Any good.
That's why I couldn't be a code option.
Damn son.

1117
01:02:38.521 --> 01:02:42.150
This fool's gold with the pope.
We get offensive mode.

1118
01:02:42.151 --> 01:02:42.751
This is what we're going to do.

1119
01:02:42.751 --> 01:02:47.720
Full defensive mode and then occasionally sniper attack and then the runaway.

1120
01:02:48.010 --> 01:02:50.950
But other than that,
I want you running,
always running,
running.

1121
01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:53.920
We have more fight in us.
Let them disqualify you.

1122
01:02:55.180 --> 01:02:59.460
Want them to forget about Caleb Starnes I don't even want them to remember Caleb

1123
01:02:59.460 --> 01:03:01.410
Starnes after your performance tonight.
Stay alive.

1124
01:03:01.411 --> 01:03:05.700
Son is always the world series of fighting move.
Given your fucking meals,

1125
01:03:05.701 --> 01:03:07.890
do you ever heard of [inaudible]?
They're interested in you.
Run

1126
01:03:10.820 --> 01:03:15.780
wants you to be their champion one.
That's the reality of,
of the business,

1127
01:03:15.781 --> 01:03:19.640
right?
I mean,
when you're
physically that way and you're,

1128
01:03:19.650 --> 01:03:23.470
it's the second round and you're out of options for this guy.
No,
you guys,

1129
01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:25.620
you guys,
it's championship aspirations.

1130
01:03:25.621 --> 01:03:28.140
But if you're a regular guy that has no shot,

1131
01:03:28.141 --> 01:03:30.870
if you one of those mid level guys that has no shot ever,

1132
01:03:31.080 --> 01:03:33.360
there's a certain point in time someone has to pull you aside and go,

1133
01:03:33.361 --> 01:03:36.720
you're still a postman.
You always have to.
You're not going to be Yoel Romero.

1134
01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:39.880
You're not going to be w two time world champion.
You're not going to remember.

1135
01:03:39.930 --> 01:03:44.120
It's so fucked up.
He goes back to the corner,
Yo son,
reality check.
Listen,

1136
01:03:44.130 --> 01:03:47.400
this guy is so much better.
I think what we should do is pro,

1137
01:03:47.430 --> 01:03:50.330
you know I'm gonna call belt or as soon as we get to allow st just what you want

1138
01:03:50.340 --> 01:03:51.173
you to do,

1139
01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:54.660
you're gotta make up a story about being injured and then you get a run just run

1140
01:03:54.661 --> 01:03:57.030
and while you're running and want you to think about what you're going to say

1141
01:03:57.031 --> 01:03:58.530
afterwards and they post fight interview,

1142
01:03:58.531 --> 01:04:00.720
that's gonna make people forgive you for running.

1143
01:04:01.770 --> 01:04:06.040
Entertaining does slip and just hit your head and faint.
Obviously we're joking.

1144
01:04:06.041 --> 01:04:06.781
Ladies and gentlemen,

1145
01:04:06.781 --> 01:04:11.670
don't get upset and don't quote this for any fucking look at that.
Boom.
Oh God,

1146
01:04:11.970 --> 01:04:13.770
that's ridiculous.
He's a beast dude.

1147
01:04:13.980 --> 01:04:18.490
He's a beast and that this is just a striking look at that right hand that's

1148
01:04:18.520 --> 01:04:20.490
just as striking his wrestling,

1149
01:04:20.491 --> 01:04:23.130
the way he ragdolled Tavarez there was even more impressive.

1150
01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:26.410
His wrestling is ridiculous and is the first fight that he used it.

1151
01:04:26.411 --> 01:04:27.121
And that's what I'm saying,

1152
01:04:27.121 --> 01:04:30.960
we haven't really seen his wrestling cause when he goes to the gym it's all

1153
01:04:30.961 --> 01:04:34.530
striking cause he's done wrestling so much.
It's second nature.
It's like Rhonda,

1154
01:04:34.740 --> 01:04:39.600
she's not doing a ton of judo.
He's easy.

1155
01:04:39.630 --> 01:04:43.950
He's going with a high level judoka like uh,
um,
um,
Bar Lombard,

1156
01:04:45.030 --> 01:04:48.960
Tyron Woodley,
he's down there too.
There's a lot of really fucking strong guys.

1157
01:04:48.961 --> 01:04:51.900
Look how fucking fast he's,
that's the 37 year.

1158
01:04:52.470 --> 01:04:57.270
Beautiful Fuck to plank down.
Oh my God.
That Greco stuff.
He's going to get a big,

1159
01:04:57.271 --> 01:05:01.740
tough fight next I give you that elbow pulling.
God is going to get a big name.

1160
01:05:01.741 --> 01:05:02.910
That dude,
he's easy to sell.

1161
01:05:02.911 --> 01:05:07.310
He's a goddamn silver medalists and one of the most decorated wrestlers and a

1162
01:05:07.340 --> 01:05:11.760
nice guy.
Nice guy.
Nobody's ever beaten cal like that twice.

1163
01:05:12.030 --> 01:05:13.880
He's a beast and he's just a,

1164
01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:17.950
he's interesting too cause he's super relaxed when he fights too.
It's relaxed,

1165
01:05:17.951 --> 01:05:18.520
calm,

1166
01:05:18.520 --> 01:05:21.460
<v 4>calm,
calm bloke.
He's just,</v>

1167
01:05:21.640 --> 01:05:25.330
he's been involved in high level competition for so long that he just knows the

1168
01:05:25.331 --> 01:05:29.680
proper mindset for winning.
So Corey [inaudible] has two amazing same,
yeah,

1169
01:05:29.710 --> 01:05:31.300
Columbia has that same thing man.

1170
01:05:31.390 --> 01:05:34.330
I feel bad about myself when you see core me right now.

1171
01:05:34.331 --> 01:05:38.210
Just watching your a marrow.
I feel bad about myself.
You'd be coming.

1172
01:05:38.220 --> 01:05:40.750
Even Mcclellan already established this.

1173
01:05:40.751 --> 01:05:45.430
You slowly I'm getting all my face is more narrow.
My nose is getting bigger.

1174
01:05:45.431 --> 01:05:48.280
I used to be cute.
Next podcast is going to show up with a scarf on.

1175
01:05:48.750 --> 01:05:52.570
What are you doing?
You know,
I want to be that guy.
I love the theater.

1176
01:05:53.140 --> 01:05:55.140
I want to just reminds me of a theater,

1177
01:05:55.170 --> 01:05:58.020
a tweed jacket and you'll be like a small English accent.
You will be.

1178
01:05:58.030 --> 01:06:01.210
I guess Brian have like,
I'd be like,
I'm having a wonderful time with you guys.

1179
01:06:01.210 --> 01:06:04.120
I have to say,
it'd be really subtle.
It would be like,

1180
01:06:04.270 --> 01:06:07.820
I must tell you the fighter and the kid podcast and be like,

1181
01:06:07.930 --> 01:06:09.790
what's going on when his voice cause real subtle.

1182
01:06:10.090 --> 01:06:14.710
It's just an extraordinarily good summer in Cape Cod now.

1183
01:06:14.940 --> 01:06:19.000
We had a wonderful time.
They'll go from the current Cowen acts into like,

1184
01:06:19.001 --> 01:06:23.290
it's just weird,
neutral sound and then it would slowly morph as time went on.

1185
01:06:23.291 --> 01:06:26.390
You know,
I lend my sentences with Henry Miller once said,

1186
01:06:26.570 --> 01:06:30.010
is that state that Stevia?
Yes.
Yes.
Is that coffee yet?

1187
01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:33.840
It comes from a plant.
It's an extract.
Of course.
I'll tell you what,

1188
01:06:34.300 --> 01:06:36.670
I spend a great deal of time in the Amazon.
Great people,

1189
01:06:36.700 --> 01:06:40.060
wonderful people down that way.
What makes,
what makes or breaks flights for me,

1190
01:06:40.061 --> 01:06:44.380
like the Verdugo fight.
Uh,
most fights,
it depends who I watch it with.

1191
01:06:44.590 --> 01:06:47.500
I don't know.
We'll see.
You're always freaking on him.
Too busy,

1192
01:06:47.590 --> 01:06:50.800
but also love to watch fights.
Are you guys,
well,
what about in Brazil and stuff?

1193
01:06:50.801 --> 01:06:52.550
What would be the ones that I don't do?
I would love to wash it.

1194
01:06:53.240 --> 01:06:55.630
We should be doing that for a while.
While we would watch it,

1195
01:06:55.631 --> 01:06:56.920
we could set it up in here too.
By the way.

1196
01:06:56.921 --> 01:06:59.530
We get podcasts while we're watching the fights.
Right.
It's brilliant.

1197
01:06:59.531 --> 01:07:01.370
We can totally do that.
It's like you know what you're doing.

1198
01:07:01.480 --> 01:07:06.070
We can totally do that.
When is the next one?
Really it,
um,
in Brazil.
Uh,

1199
01:07:06.071 --> 01:07:08.230
where's Eric?
So,
but wasn't,
that doesn't have to be Brazil.

1200
01:07:08.350 --> 01:07:09.310
When is the next fight?

1201
01:07:09.570 --> 01:07:14.110
Dude is probably a fight that we could podcast from this room while the fight is

1202
01:07:14.111 --> 01:07:19.000
going on.
Just do it on Ustream and just let everybody know it.
Listen,

1203
01:07:19.180 --> 01:07:22.690
this is not a regular podcast.
Okay?
If you're expecting cohesive,

1204
01:07:22.870 --> 01:07:24.970
cohesive content,
something to make sense all over.

1205
01:07:25.270 --> 01:07:27.940
Turn this off right now because what we're doing is we're watching fights.

1206
01:07:28.040 --> 01:07:32.500
So if you want a companion to watching the fights will sync with some educated

1207
01:07:32.600 --> 01:07:35.230
opinion,
but it'd be fun to do.
Oh Shit.

1208
01:07:35.590 --> 01:07:39.970
J D s versus me.
Oh,
chick.
Oh Shit.

1209
01:07:40.330 --> 01:07:44.440
That's way,
that's it.
No,
you got Munoz Musashi.

1210
01:07:45.130 --> 01:07:49.270
And what's before that?
That's the one that found Silva.
May 10th can we do it?

1211
01:07:49.390 --> 01:07:53.200
Can we do it boys?
Yes,
we can do.
We can do it.
That's a good goddamn fight too.

1212
01:07:53.270 --> 01:07:57.310
I'm here.
Let's do it.
Dot Brown.
Yeah.

1213
01:07:57.640 --> 01:07:59.860
Did I say Travis Brown?
Matt Brown.
Sorry.
Matt Brown.

1214
01:07:59.861 --> 01:08:02.740
Aaron and Matt Brown backgrounds coming off.
I'm sorry,
Matt.

1215
01:08:02.890 --> 01:08:06.730
Matt Brown is coming off of a back surgery to yeah,
not back surgery.
Excuse me.

1216
01:08:06.731 --> 01:08:07.511
A back injury.

1217
01:08:07.511 --> 01:08:12.110
He had a disc that herniated on him and he had a hard time,
uh,

1218
01:08:12.170 --> 01:08:15.900
in the middle of camp,
hurt his back and it had a pull out into watch Eric

1219
01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:18.260
<v 3>of it might be a little better looking than big brown.</v>

1220
01:08:18.290 --> 01:08:22.390
I'm going to be honest with Ya.
Fuck.
Sorry.
I see me in this tank.

1221
01:08:22.580 --> 01:08:25.880
You're a cute guy,
but he's a cutie pie.
He's got that hair in his highest,
almost.

1222
01:08:25.881 --> 01:08:30.130
No.
Matt Brown is a fucking animal.
A small to breaks cars off pieces.

1223
01:08:30.140 --> 01:08:33.630
What sets it guys just get your,
what's your calling that fight?
There's no car.

1224
01:08:33.650 --> 01:08:36.980
I never make a call,
but he's ferocious.
Brown is for fucking ferocious.

1225
01:08:36.981 --> 01:08:39.230
It's not just this pace,
it's his mind.

1226
01:08:39.340 --> 01:08:43.880
The fucking dude overcomes overcomes guys.
I don't think he's the most athletic,

1227
01:08:43.881 --> 01:08:47.240
but it's just his pace and demeanor.
Beats guys,
high level guy.

1228
01:08:47.250 --> 01:08:51.820
You got him over a tents.
I'm like Joe,
I never make pigs.

1229
01:08:51.850 --> 01:08:56.650
Yeah,
not good to meet stops.
Doesn't make any sense.
Tough.
However,
however,

1230
01:08:57.100 --> 01:09:00.580
the reason why we should definitely let fights together is for me,

1231
01:09:00.581 --> 01:09:03.400
it's tough to watch fights.
It's super tough to,
well it depends.

1232
01:09:03.580 --> 01:09:07.170
It will literally ruin a fight for me because I been with him.

1233
01:09:07.180 --> 01:09:09.070
Where were we're dudes,
bro.

1234
01:09:10.690 --> 01:09:12.730
Like Rhonda is a very close friend of mine.

1235
01:09:12.760 --> 01:09:15.970
It's different when you watch finders,
you know,
fight,
right.

1236
01:09:16.330 --> 01:09:18.560
I'm trying to order the paper view and the,
the,

1237
01:09:18.561 --> 01:09:21.820
the main cards about to start my fucking cable will work.
Right?

1238
01:09:21.880 --> 01:09:24.850
So I'm freaking out.
I'm like,
what am I sweating?
I'm not going to go to a bar.

1239
01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:25.601
Not Chance.

1240
01:09:25.601 --> 01:09:28.960
I'm showing up to a bar watching the UFC fight cause you just get harassed.

1241
01:09:28.961 --> 01:09:32.860
Get mobbed.
So I'm like,
what am I gonna do?
So I texted my coach Tony,

1242
01:09:32.861 --> 01:09:36.070
who lives in Santa Monica.
I'm like,
Bro,
I need you to get the fights.
He's like,

1243
01:09:36.071 --> 01:09:38.590
Bro,
I'm over this guy's house.
I know you hate watching with other people.

1244
01:09:38.591 --> 01:09:41.080
Everyone knows this about me because I know you hate watching other people.

1245
01:09:41.290 --> 01:09:43.690
No one's really here,
man,
come to the basement.
This guy,

1246
01:09:43.780 --> 01:09:46.560
they probably won't know who you are.
Just come like fuck you.

1247
01:09:46.561 --> 01:09:50.140
It's only thing to do.
I race down there,
I make it just in time.

1248
01:09:50.380 --> 01:09:54.040
There's like two guys there,
but they're pretty drunk and I come in with a hood,

1249
01:09:54.041 --> 01:09:56.140
you know that he can't really tell.
So I just sit down.

1250
01:09:57.340 --> 01:09:59.410
All of a sudden these dudes a shine to pack in.

1251
01:09:59.411 --> 01:10:02.080
You've heard this story by and these guys are packing in,
right?
And I'm like,

1252
01:10:02.200 --> 01:10:05.470
Dang,
I'm getting,
I just get uncomfortable because I'm like,
man.

1253
01:10:05.471 --> 01:10:10.060
Then you start asking me questions,
Blah Blah Blah.
So finally one of the guys,

1254
01:10:10.360 --> 01:10:14.660
he was probably 50 years old,
highest shit,
which is whatever you,

1255
01:10:14.690 --> 01:10:19.360
I know you guys support that high shit.
Cheeto fingers.
CIDO fingers,

1256
01:10:19.390 --> 01:10:22.300
grateful dead tee shirt,
right?
I want to give a motivational talk,

1257
01:10:23.020 --> 01:10:26.710
but he looks over at me and just goes,
Oh shit,

1258
01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:30.130
Brendan Schaub Mike,
what's up man?
It was,
oh man,
blah.

1259
01:10:30.131 --> 01:10:33.160
And then so from there I'm taking pictures of guys watching a fight and it's my

1260
01:10:33.161 --> 01:10:37.660
nightmare.
I'm like,
oh no,
and this is why it's my nightmare.

1261
01:10:37.661 --> 01:10:41.290
During the middle of fight,
one of the guys go,
hey bro,
hey bro.

1262
01:10:41.950 --> 01:10:45.880
Do you know Max Holloway?
And then that Max Lawler,
he is some random name.

1263
01:10:45.881 --> 01:10:50.440
Do you know Max Billy?
Do you know Max Billy idol?
Uh,
how would I know him?

1264
01:10:50.441 --> 01:10:52.930
He was a,
he wrestled me in high school,
man.

1265
01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:55.833
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1266
01:10:56.760 --> 01:10:58.440
<v 3>How would I know you got to wrestle with in high school years?</v>

1267
01:10:58.590 --> 01:11:02.010
I have all your answers,
man.
I'll you Russ or stick together Bro.

1268
01:11:02.280 --> 01:11:05.100
And that's the kind of Shit I'm dealing with during fights.

1269
01:11:05.430 --> 01:11:09.420
And then this is the best part.
Then Ron is walking out one guy,

1270
01:11:09.560 --> 01:11:13.830
they have no idea,
right?
Rhonda and I close.
He goes,
Bro stands up,

1271
01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:18.360
would you fucker?
Who would you fucking hell no man,

1272
01:11:18.450 --> 01:11:21.300
way too big one guy goes,
oh hell yeah.

1273
01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:24.870
I would tap them and I let her arm bar me and I'm literally sitting there like,

1274
01:11:25.080 --> 01:11:29.160
oh no.
Locking the door and beating,

1275
01:11:29.161 --> 01:11:30.690
slapping everybody with an open hand.

1276
01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:35.720
I wish I were spanking literally as soon as they use the Sara Mcmann fight,

1277
01:11:36.061 --> 01:11:40.800
she needs the girl and gets out of there.
I literally bolt out the door.
See Ya.

1278
01:11:40.830 --> 01:11:45.120
Thanks for the fights and startup along.
Got Mister.
It's tough man.

1279
01:11:45.150 --> 01:11:46.750
It's tough to watch fights.
Yeah.

1280
01:11:46.950 --> 01:11:50.220
You don't want to watch anything that you care about with morons cause they're

1281
01:11:50.221 --> 01:11:53.610
going to talk over it and they got,
all they do is talk the whole fight bro.

1282
01:11:53.630 --> 01:11:56.230
So what are you thinking?
Are you get nervous four or five?
Does it hurt?

1283
01:11:56.520 --> 01:11:57.353
Does it hurt?

1284
01:11:58.260 --> 01:12:01.230
Does it hurt when you get punched in the face at her when you get punched in the

1285
01:12:01.231 --> 01:12:04.230
face?
Listen,
if I'm home we'll do them right here man.
It's perfect.

1286
01:12:04.231 --> 01:12:07.680
We have two TVS here and other TV out there.
We're good.
It's exciting.
We can,

1287
01:12:07.800 --> 01:12:11.970
we could,
I usually prefer to watch them by myself in the dark.

1288
01:12:12.650 --> 01:12:15.970
Watch him jacking off with my tears.
I watch them almost always jack knife,

1289
01:12:16.140 --> 01:12:20.510
my tears cause I'm not fighting.
Just Ooh crap.

1290
01:12:21.780 --> 01:12:24.510
I'll watch him with Brian and he'll be like,
bro,
my friend,

1291
01:12:24.540 --> 01:12:29.160
but expert bro Expert at this.
Brian does,
man.
He's my friend's an expert.

1292
01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:34.050
Oh really?
He's picking the six to one favorite to win.
Oh Wow.

1293
01:12:34.051 --> 01:12:36.480
Genius.
Genius.
He's good though.

1294
01:12:37.730 --> 01:12:42.030
See friends that are experts.
Brian,
buddy gays.
Casey's both our friends actually.

1295
01:12:42.031 --> 01:12:46.770
He's a good fighter.
He's tough guy.
Brandon just shook his head.

1296
01:12:47.160 --> 01:12:49.560
Well.
I mean he knows it.
He knows what he's talking about though.

1297
01:12:49.561 --> 01:12:53.510
He wrestled with and fan fight.
There's a lot of arms going on there.

1298
01:12:53.550 --> 01:12:54.660
I don't feel a confidence.

1299
01:12:55.410 --> 01:12:59.390
Brian throws with the word the word fight around a lot.

1300
01:12:59.490 --> 01:13:03.150
Pretty uncanny.
How good.
How do you get,
do you think he is?
Well,

1301
01:13:03.270 --> 01:13:05.980
I mean as her pitch John Jones to win has to be good.

1302
01:13:06.330 --> 01:13:10.320
He won nationals in Jujitsu training.
We asked,

1303
01:13:10.690 --> 01:13:13.530
Sylvia asked how good or his pics,
oh,

1304
01:13:13.531 --> 01:13:18.531
almost a hundred percent I disagree 100% because he's a wrestler.

1305
01:13:19.350 --> 01:13:23.390
So he support Sarah McMahon and Brian goes,
what do you,

1306
01:13:23.940 --> 01:13:26.190
what do you think of a sick man?
Miss Rhonda Rousey?

1307
01:13:26.191 --> 01:13:29.100
And I go make man very talented fighter.

1308
01:13:29.130 --> 01:13:31.940
It will be the easiest fight of her career.
I guarantee you it's true.

1309
01:13:31.990 --> 01:13:35.280
Because I see Ron does training.
I know Sara McMahon.
I see her right?

1310
01:13:35.850 --> 01:13:39.630
I see what she's done.
I'm telling you it's going to be your easiest fight.

1311
01:13:39.631 --> 01:13:42.050
And he argues,
oh,
it's going to be the hardest fire,
career,
whatever,

1312
01:13:42.240 --> 01:13:44.730
easiest fire around this career.
So that's whatever that may be.
However,

1313
01:13:45.330 --> 01:13:46.860
let's talk about this with Rhonda though.

1314
01:13:47.010 --> 01:13:49.920
The reason why these girls are fucked when they fight Ronda,

1315
01:13:50.100 --> 01:13:52.260
cause the same thing as the Mike Tyson effect.

1316
01:13:52.620 --> 01:13:55.650
These girls go from fighting on Facebook prelims.

1317
01:13:55.770 --> 01:13:59.790
They win one fight and then you go,
hey,
great job.

1318
01:13:59.791 --> 01:14:04.070
Rhonda does everyone to fight.
Here you go.
Main event primetime.
Hey,

1319
01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:05.160
who's phone's going off?

1320
01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:08.480
<v 0>Not Mine.
What does that clock</v>

1321
01:14:11.190 --> 01:14:12.023
well,
that world

1322
01:14:12.190 --> 01:14:16.510
<v 2>with somebody,
some alarm,
no alarm on it.
Give me a stupid thing,</v>

1323
01:14:16.690 --> 01:14:19.030
but I bet I will regardless.

1324
01:14:19.031 --> 01:14:24.030
His picks are way better than both of ours,
not mine.

1325
01:14:26.310 --> 01:14:30.510
That's where it's seven to six.
That's how weird it was.

1326
01:14:30.511 --> 01:14:35.380
A sign not to go off.
I don't even know how to set it anyway.

1327
01:14:36.320 --> 01:14:40.060
Definitely.
That's scary.
That's scary.
I could never watch fights with morons.

1328
01:14:40.061 --> 01:14:41.380
I've done it before.
It's brutal.

1329
01:14:41.381 --> 01:14:45.670
They asked too many questions and the disrespectful to,
he's a bitch.
He's scared.

1330
01:14:45.671 --> 01:14:49.480
He's a bitch.
Like,
oh well that same party guy,

1331
01:14:49.481 --> 01:14:52.210
he goes pro our bar all day,
all day.

1332
01:14:54.600 --> 01:14:56.910
They're against the cage clinch.
There's no fucking arm.

1333
01:14:56.911 --> 01:15:00.280
But what are you talking about?
Oh No,
you're in the wrong place.
Yeah,

1334
01:15:00.281 --> 01:15:01.960
you should've just left.
I would've left for sure.

1335
01:15:02.500 --> 01:15:05.560
I want to grab my friend and fucking cock slapped him to,
well,

1336
01:15:05.940 --> 01:15:09.490
he didn't know either though.
He didn't know either.
So it was the worst.

1337
01:15:09.950 --> 01:15:12.340
It's the worst.
But he's inviting idiots over his house.

1338
01:15:12.341 --> 01:15:13.480
How she's not know who's coming to,

1339
01:15:13.830 --> 01:15:18.070
I was at my friend and I roasted them on the fire of the kid that next morning

1340
01:15:18.071 --> 01:15:21.220
and they all heard it.
And then the next day I go to the gym and that,
you know,

1341
01:15:21.221 --> 01:15:23.860
they're just regular students that I go the gym.
I can tell him I'm like,

1342
01:15:23.890 --> 01:15:28.000
son of a bitch.
I want to be like,
Yo,
Cheetah fingers come here.
Cheeto fingers.

1343
01:15:28.001 --> 01:15:30.040
Come here.
Let me talk to you.
I'm going to give a pep talk.

1344
01:15:30.160 --> 01:15:34.450
You're 50 but down the Cheetos ditched the shirt.
Let's go for a jog.

1345
01:15:35.140 --> 01:15:38.650
Wow.
How rude.
But necessarily

1346
01:15:40.900 --> 01:15:44.200
necessary.
Some dudes need to be heard.
I think so.
They need to hear that shit.

1347
01:15:44.201 --> 01:15:45.400
They don't want to,
but they need it.

1348
01:15:45.420 --> 01:15:48.480
But most people just want a pep talk from a line.

1349
01:15:48.570 --> 01:15:53.020
Casell I'm giving it for free man.
Wow.
Wow.

1350
01:15:56.410 --> 01:16:01.410
There was a girl I dated who was a really pretty girl.
Nice girl and a way.
Yeah,

1351
01:16:01.550 --> 01:16:03.820
I'm stopping right there.
I'm going to check out full of shit.

1352
01:16:03.880 --> 01:16:05.150
I don't believe a fucking word.

1353
01:16:05.720 --> 01:16:09.250
Know the story and her breath was,

1354
01:16:10.090 --> 01:16:12.820
I mean it smelled like like an open grave.

1355
01:16:12.850 --> 01:16:15.630
Like I've never craziest thing I've ever smelled.

1356
01:16:17.380 --> 01:16:21.330
That's a deal breaker by the way.
I remember we were at the elevator.

1357
01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:24.010
I have to pencil.
I was excited about dating her and I went and I went,

1358
01:16:24.340 --> 01:16:25.120
that's weird.

1359
01:16:25.120 --> 01:16:28.000
It's impossible that someone's mouth could smell like that's not possible.

1360
01:16:28.390 --> 01:16:32.160
So I go,
that's probably doing meth.
Uh,
well,
no,
or sundown.

1361
01:16:33.090 --> 01:16:36.910
I'll tell you.
I'll tell you what happened,
right?
We're second.
Nope,
nope.

1362
01:16:36.980 --> 01:16:40.930
So she couldn't get it.
So anyway,
long story short,
we're in the elevator.

1363
01:16:40.931 --> 01:16:44.500
I'm like,
Eh.
Then we get the cab,
this is in New York.
And I go,
all right,

1364
01:16:44.501 --> 01:16:48.310
there's a situation here.
She'll eat.
I just want to get laid.
I'm young.
I'm like,

1365
01:16:48.311 --> 01:16:52.470
let's just,
she'll eat it.
It'll be fine.
I don't know what's going on.
Ah,
I'm not,

1366
01:16:52.670 --> 01:16:54.730
I'm not going to pay attention.
I'm not gonna pay attention.
You know,

1367
01:16:54.731 --> 01:16:59.290
he just like,
it can't be,
uh,
we get to her place.
We started making out,

1368
01:16:59.350 --> 01:17:03.480
and I,
I'm telling you,
it was beyond anything I've ever smelled.
Like,

1369
01:17:04.750 --> 01:17:08.200
oh,
look,
at the time,
I don't know what I did.
I was like,
let me get out of here.

1370
01:17:08.201 --> 01:17:10.340
You know,
I'm such a bitch that I actually,

1371
01:17:10.370 --> 01:17:12.680
<v 1>I didn't want to be rude.
I think I kissed her a little more and I was like,</v>

1372
01:17:12.710 --> 01:17:15.740
all right,
hold your breath,
father.
I got out of there.
I say to her friend,
I go,

1373
01:17:15.741 --> 01:17:18.320
listen,
I got to tell you,
your friend is is great.

1374
01:17:18.560 --> 01:17:23.510
<v 5>She's got the worst breath.
And she goes,
we all talk about that.</v>

1375
01:17:24.590 --> 01:17:27.140
How long have you known?
She goes,
oh my God,
I'll do college.

1376
01:17:27.141 --> 01:17:30.800
She could never get a day.
She could ever called him.
And I go,
well,
can you,

1377
01:17:30.830 --> 01:17:35.570
can you tell her you're her friend you are doing her whole life is ruined

1378
01:17:35.571 --> 01:17:37.610
because you can't cause it's embarrassing.

1379
01:17:38.060 --> 01:17:41.300
Tell her that her breath smells like an open grave.
You gotta tell her.

1380
01:17:41.301 --> 01:17:44.150
That's a tough talk to have with someone.
May,
it depends on your friends.

1381
01:17:44.270 --> 01:17:47.360
I've had a friend who's a,
a fighter.
I'm not gonna mention names,
who,

1382
01:17:47.510 --> 01:17:50.390
he's not very good things.
Haven't been going his way and yes we will.

1383
01:17:50.391 --> 01:17:54.730
We should do.
I said,
I think she get a job.
Wow,
that's,
that's,

1384
01:17:54.740 --> 01:17:57.980
but that's you.
That's me the friend.
Nah Man.

1385
01:17:57.981 --> 01:18:00.590
Keep playing grab ass and hopefully things work out for you.

1386
01:18:00.591 --> 01:18:03.770
Do you know how many to many people know how many people in an acting class for

1387
01:18:03.771 --> 01:18:07.970
years?
I sat there and gone,
the note should be quit.

1388
01:18:08.780 --> 01:18:13.760
Quit you.
It's never going to happen.
You gotta to go back to college.

1389
01:18:13.840 --> 01:18:16.010
Brian,
Brian and I were talking about this on the right here.

1390
01:18:16.100 --> 01:18:19.940
Do you believe like something like talent,
you're born with talent,

1391
01:18:19.941 --> 01:18:23.480
either happy or not,
or is it a clean slate and from experiences,

1392
01:18:23.680 --> 01:18:27.330
<v 1>it's definitely not a clean slate.
100%.
The people that are more talented,</v>

1393
01:18:27.331 --> 01:18:29.760
it almost everything,
whether it's comedy,
whether it's music,

1394
01:18:29.761 --> 01:18:32.790
whether it's fighting on it or you don't,
right?
Physical talent without a doubt.

1395
01:18:32.791 --> 01:18:35.820
It varies wildly.
Vary so wildly.

1396
01:18:36.120 --> 01:18:39.690
There's advantages that certain people have that are so undeniable

1397
01:18:39.890 --> 01:18:44.030
<v 5>is this fucking thing.
Oh my God.
Oh,
it's killed us.
What is it?
Well,</v>

1398
01:18:44.031 --> 01:18:48.860
the physical talent,
David Epstein's book,
uh,
that the,
uh,
the sports gene,
um,

1399
01:18:49.020 --> 01:18:51.800
he,
he makes that case.
He proves that it's amazing.

1400
01:18:53.690 --> 01:18:56.480
I feel like a bomb is going to go off.
I hope it's not.

1401
01:18:58.280 --> 01:19:01.760
It's supposed to be just a nice little clock.
How does it,

1402
01:19:02.300 --> 01:19:04.250
<v 1>it gives you a 10 minute warning.
Is that what it was?</v>

1403
01:19:04.280 --> 01:19:07.520
Did you read that book then?
It's like a minute to six now.
You made that.

1404
01:19:07.560 --> 01:19:08.560
Do you see?
You heard of that bucket,

1405
01:19:08.570 --> 01:19:11.660
the sports gene you told me about a thousand times,
but I have not read it,

1406
01:19:12.440 --> 01:19:14.120
but uh,
it's without a doubt.
True.

1407
01:19:14.180 --> 01:19:16.920
There's certain athletes that just have a huge advantage.
I mean,

1408
01:19:16.940 --> 01:19:20.870
I think some people are just naturally better at math,
for example.
Sorry.
Yes,

1409
01:19:20.900 --> 01:19:23.020
it's 100% true.
It's 100% sure.

1410
01:19:23.030 --> 01:19:26.000
There's certain people that have been more eloquent way of describing things.

1411
01:19:26.001 --> 01:19:28.160
That's fascinating.
There's certain people that are better storytellers,

1412
01:19:28.180 --> 01:19:30.440
better at reading and emotion,
and I don't know why.

1413
01:19:30.470 --> 01:19:32.060
I don't know if it's a learned skill.

1414
01:19:32.061 --> 01:19:34.310
I think certainly storytelling is a learned skill.

1415
01:19:34.311 --> 01:19:37.460
It depends on who you around when you growing up.
I think too,

1416
01:19:37.640 --> 01:19:39.710
and I think that if you're a guy who's been around a fun,

1417
01:19:39.730 --> 01:19:42.070
if your dad's boring as fuck and you're boring as fuck,

1418
01:19:42.071 --> 01:19:45.560
and then finally have 30 you meet a bunch of charismatic people who know how to

1419
01:19:45.561 --> 01:19:49.670
spin a yarn too late,
you're behind it.
You're so far behind the eight ball,

1420
01:19:49.671 --> 01:19:52.100
you're never going to figure out how to be interesting so you better get rich.

1421
01:19:52.130 --> 01:19:53.660
There's an evolutionary biologist,

1422
01:19:53.661 --> 01:19:56.360
probably the most famous named Steven pinker at a Harvard University.

1423
01:19:56.410 --> 01:19:58.310
I know he is.
He wrote a book called the blank slate,

1424
01:19:58.311 --> 01:20:01.070
which I'm reading now about that saying,
we're not a blank slate.

1425
01:20:01.580 --> 01:20:05.810
You can certainly learn a great deal as a human being.
This.

1426
01:20:05.990 --> 01:20:08.340
There's a great Pete,
we have a huge potential

1427
01:20:08.340 --> 01:20:09.840
<v 4>to change our lives with what we learned,</v>

1428
01:20:09.870 --> 01:20:14.040
but the fact of the matter is most of the size proves the fact that some people

1429
01:20:14.041 --> 01:20:18.660
will have a proclivity for,
you know,
chess over whatever it might.

1430
01:20:18.661 --> 01:20:19.351
But not only that,

1431
01:20:19.351 --> 01:20:21.600
there's some people that have a lot of the aspects of her life that were

1432
01:20:21.601 --> 01:20:25.070
completely beyond their control until they became an adult.
Like the childhood,

1433
01:20:25.080 --> 01:20:27.720
how they were raised,
raised them.
Who abused him,
who fuck them up,

1434
01:20:27.721 --> 01:20:30.140
who put them in a bad situation?
What kind of fears?
Yeah,

1435
01:20:30.141 --> 01:20:33.600
what that did to their brain chemistry.
It without a doubt,
the wiring of the way,

1436
01:20:33.610 --> 01:20:38.040
the very way they think with sports is different too.
Like I,
I've had,
uh,

1437
01:20:38.100 --> 01:20:41.020
you know,
I've given college major college team talk,

1438
01:20:41.021 --> 01:20:45.180
stuff like that and then a gym,
I won't say any names.

1439
01:20:45.181 --> 01:20:48.840
They go Brendon,
come talk with these guys to tell him,
man,

1440
01:20:48.841 --> 01:20:51.360
tell him a lot of the guys aren't hitting mitts or they're not,

1441
01:20:51.420 --> 01:20:54.480
they're not showing it for training,
they're not doing this,
not doing that.

1442
01:20:54.920 --> 01:20:57.450
And I told them,
I said all right,
I mean I'll talk to them.

1443
01:20:57.451 --> 01:20:59.850
You don't want me to talk to him cause I'm coming to sport.
I'm very cut throat.

1444
01:20:59.851 --> 01:21:03.540
Right.
Let me see.
I've seen it all man.
I said,
listen,

1445
01:21:04.830 --> 01:21:09.830
if someone has to give you a pep talk and tell you to show up every day and

1446
01:21:10.560 --> 01:21:12.900
train,
it's too late.
You don't have it.

1447
01:21:13.350 --> 01:21:17.910
Cause I know guys who like they literally have you don't give me Jim keys,

1448
01:21:18.090 --> 01:21:21.990
I will be in that bitch 24 seven they do not give me a gym key cause I will

1449
01:21:21.991 --> 01:21:25.380
overtrain like a motherfucker.
So with these guys not even showing up,

1450
01:21:25.381 --> 01:21:28.650
and I know other guys just like me who aren't in the UFC and you,

1451
01:21:28.680 --> 01:21:32.250
we can't even get you to come to practice.
You're not that passionate about it.

1452
01:21:32.400 --> 01:21:36.750
You're wasting your time.
So the pep talk from me to you is go get a job.
Yeah.

1453
01:21:36.780 --> 01:21:39.030
If you're not completely obsessed,
it's not something you should be into.

1454
01:21:39.090 --> 01:21:41.790
Not a chance in fighting.
Yeah.
You shouldn't be dabbling.

1455
01:21:41.810 --> 01:21:46.050
And if you have to get a pep talk from a a guy,

1456
01:21:46.051 --> 01:21:48.360
you know who you might,
whatever he look up to,

1457
01:21:48.361 --> 01:21:52.500
who's in the UFC where you want to be at and he inspires you to get your ass in

1458
01:21:52.501 --> 01:21:56.910
the gym.
It's too late.
I always use this analogy I said,
can imagine,
okay,

1459
01:21:56.911 --> 01:21:58.800
imagine that you're a guy who says,
you know what,

1460
01:21:58.801 --> 01:22:01.200
I'm just going to have a few fights.
I'm just going to,
you know,

1461
01:22:01.350 --> 01:22:04.350
I'll give it a shot.
I'll give it a go.
I'll have a half an adventure.

1462
01:22:04.710 --> 01:22:08.120
What if on the other side of that adventure is a guy like Mike Tyson who's

1463
01:22:08.130 --> 01:22:11.430
completely obsessed,
not only is GE genetically gifted,

1464
01:22:11.580 --> 01:22:14.370
not only is he freakishly fast for a heavyweight,

1465
01:22:14.550 --> 01:22:17.700
not only is he trained by a guy who's become as mentors,

1466
01:22:17.701 --> 01:22:20.600
one of the greatest minds,
the world of boxing has ever known.

1467
01:22:20.610 --> 01:22:24.150
Custom motto when it comes to psychology and the,
the,
the,
the,
the,

1468
01:22:24.360 --> 01:22:27.180
the pumping up of a fighter and the changing the fighter's mentality.

1469
01:22:27.290 --> 01:22:29.400
Custom motto was a bad motherfucker.

1470
01:22:29.640 --> 01:22:32.730
He would tell guys things that they would be able to carry with them for the

1471
01:22:32.731 --> 01:22:35.180
rest of their lives.
Look at Tyson's career when he passed away.
Yeah.

1472
01:22:35.310 --> 01:22:37.280
Well even after he got rid of Kevin Rooney.
Yeah.

1473
01:22:37.320 --> 01:22:40.290
Who was the last bond to a custom model.

1474
01:22:40.530 --> 01:22:43.830
But customer would tell him shit like food,
you know,
fire is,

1475
01:22:43.860 --> 01:22:45.630
it can either be your friend or it could be your enemy.

1476
01:22:45.631 --> 01:22:48.010
You can either cook your food with it or if he can't control it,

1477
01:22:48.140 --> 01:22:52.260
it'll burn your house,
your whole house down.
Fears like fire.
And that fear,

1478
01:22:52.261 --> 01:22:54.810
if you can control it,
it would make you a better finer.
So you're,

1479
01:22:54.820 --> 01:22:56.540
you're saying Billy McKee,
who doesn't,

1480
01:22:56.550 --> 01:23:00.300
who's not doing this is going to get tore up cause you gotta stir.
Fuck,

1481
01:23:01.220 --> 01:23:02.053
I'm just going to get,

1482
01:23:02.280 --> 01:23:07.240
you could get hurt at Marvin fractured and Marvin frame four times the Afro and

1483
01:23:07.270 --> 01:23:11.710
Tyson came out,
guns blazing,
most horrific display of destruction.

1484
01:23:11.711 --> 01:23:15.100
I think I've ever seen the heavyweight division because it was never a matter of

1485
01:23:15.101 --> 01:23:16.480
whether or not Marvis was going to win.

1486
01:23:16.690 --> 01:23:19.880
It was a matter of how many seconds it was going to take before Tyson land to

1487
01:23:19.881 --> 01:23:22.990
the boom on them.
And as soon as he cornered him,
he just started mauling him.

1488
01:23:23.200 --> 01:23:26.200
And you know,
Marvin said a famous dad,
Joe Frazier was his dad,

1489
01:23:26.201 --> 01:23:29.500
but he was never a guy that was a monster.
He was never a guy.
That was a scale.

1490
01:23:29.530 --> 01:23:32.890
So you can run into a monster even if you're Marvis your monster.

1491
01:23:32.891 --> 01:23:36.790
Imagine if it's you forget about anybody else.
Imagine if it's a,

1492
01:23:36.791 --> 01:23:41.530
you look and I'm looking down.
Yeah,
he's terrified.
This was when Tyson was,

1493
01:23:41.531 --> 01:23:43.000
before we even fought for the title,

1494
01:23:43.001 --> 01:23:46.810
and this was one of the big fights that sort of cemented in everybody's idea

1495
01:23:46.811 --> 01:23:51.010
that he was the next coming because Marvis Frazier had had some good fights.

1496
01:23:51.011 --> 01:23:54.700
He looked pretty good.
He looked like a good boxer.
He was really well trained.

1497
01:23:54.850 --> 01:23:56.500
But Tyson was a deem and like,

1498
01:23:56.501 --> 01:24:01.270
look how calm and Lucy was as he paced around the,
it's ridiculous.

1499
01:24:01.330 --> 01:24:04.600
We've played this on the podcast no less than five times,
just cause it's not,

1500
01:24:04.601 --> 01:24:05.291
in my opinion,

1501
01:24:05.291 --> 01:24:08.440
it's like one of the most devastating heavyweight performances in the history of

1502
01:24:08.441 --> 01:24:12.870
the sport.
And a perfect example,
and it was on ABC,
I'd love to see Marvis Marv,

1503
01:24:13.160 --> 01:24:14.980
uh,
Frazier fight Tyson.

1504
01:24:15.550 --> 01:24:19.130
Mike Tyson went done the same thing to Joe for probably right to people say,
no,

1505
01:24:19.660 --> 01:24:23.320
you got to watch the Frazier foreman fight.
Frazier always had a problem with,

1506
01:24:23.321 --> 01:24:27.880
but look at Cim.
Lampi sexy bitch.
Look at them doing the damn thing.
Young.

1507
01:24:28.860 --> 01:24:32.440
Passionate about boxing.
Oh yeah.
He loves it.
It talks about a shit about MMA.

1508
01:24:32.441 --> 01:24:34.990
Unfortunately.
I think he's come around.

1509
01:24:34.991 --> 01:24:39.500
I think I heard an interview lately where I think he's being [inaudible] that

1510
01:24:39.570 --> 01:24:43.290
legendary nights that Gadi Gadi Ward.
He starts crying.
Oh Man.
It was,

1511
01:24:43.291 --> 01:24:47.140
it's hard not to tear.
Look man,
look at this and Joe Frazier,

1512
01:24:47.200 --> 01:24:51.730
he got to know that his son is going to get crushed.
He knew.
Yeah,
he kind of,

1513
01:24:51.790 --> 01:24:54.790
I mean probably not,
but you got to have an idea.

1514
01:24:54.791 --> 01:24:57.970
I mean he knows that his son's capable.
That's Kevin Rooney.
Yeah.

1515
01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:02.600
This is after custom monitory.
Double lookout.
Jacked Carry Jack Trice.

1516
01:25:03.040 --> 01:25:06.310
How would he have done in MMA?
The same with a smoke people.

1517
01:25:06.520 --> 01:25:11.320
He would have been terrifying if you taught him
everything else.

1518
01:25:11.350 --> 01:25:14.860
I disagree.
I think it's tough to say that.
It's tough to say that.
You're right.

1519
01:25:14.870 --> 01:25:16.720
He's a very undersized heavyweight.

1520
01:25:16.810 --> 01:25:21.150
You'd gotten picked it like John Jones would have picked him apart.
Heavyweight.

1521
01:25:21.220 --> 01:25:26.020
He could easily have been two oh five he only weighed about two 1880 probably

1522
01:25:26.021 --> 01:25:28.240
one 85 wow.
That's crazy to think.

1523
01:25:29.080 --> 01:25:31.660
You mean cause he would have had to deal with that with kicks and stuff when it

1524
01:25:31.661 --> 01:25:34.510
wrestling,
it's hard to say,
man,
like a lot of guys aren't.

1525
01:25:34.540 --> 01:25:37.540
They don't want to wrestle.
They don't want to do just do they hate grappling?

1526
01:25:37.560 --> 01:25:37.870
Yeah,

1527
01:25:37.870 --> 01:25:40.990
so even if you have pushed her up so she had so he could see the actual fight

1528
01:25:40.991 --> 01:25:45.340
itself.
It doesn't look right about there as good thing.
Here it goes.

1529
01:25:46.270 --> 01:25:48.970
He was so fast.
He was so unmanageable.
You couldn't,

1530
01:25:49.240 --> 01:25:50.890
that was the other thing you were talking about in the fight with John.

1531
01:25:50.891 --> 01:25:52.930
John's trying to find out,
look at this.

1532
01:25:53.370 --> 01:25:56.650
If they don't even get a close up on them fast enough to see the destruction as

1533
01:25:56.651 --> 01:26:00.130
it's gone down.
They started the camera's way in a pullout,

1534
01:26:00.280 --> 01:26:03.230
but they don't realize at Tyson just charged Zach at the beginning of the round.

1535
01:26:03.380 --> 01:26:04.040
You can't just start

1536
01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:06.400
<v 3>the camera away.
My sparring partners that,
that,</v>

1537
01:26:06.680 --> 01:26:10.220
that mimic magnificent in the years.
Here it is.

1538
01:26:10.880 --> 01:26:15.080
Oh Bang,
Bang,
Bang.
No,
honestly,

1539
01:26:15.230 --> 01:26:16.700
this is a terrible video by the way.

1540
01:26:17.060 --> 01:26:20.180
That's one of the worst copies of the youtube videos.
Whoever put that up,

1541
01:26:20.181 --> 01:26:24.500
take it down.
Get yourself head knocked him.
Listen,
when,

1542
01:26:24.510 --> 01:26:26.810
when you fight Mike Tyson,
when he fight Jon Jones,

1543
01:26:26.811 --> 01:26:28.640
when you fight these certain guys,

1544
01:26:29.150 --> 01:26:32.870
you get one shot at him and it's live with millions of people watching because

1545
01:26:32.871 --> 01:26:36.890
you cannot duplicate in the gym.
You get one real life shot.

1546
01:26:37.280 --> 01:26:40.730
That's why people have so many problems with these guys.
John Jones,
listen,

1547
01:26:40.910 --> 01:26:45.770
there's no one in your gym the size of John Jones doing these weird kicks and

1548
01:26:45.860 --> 01:26:49.490
throwing these weird angles and doing these shoulder locks against the cage.

1549
01:26:49.580 --> 01:26:53.330
You get one real life.
Go at it.
And by the time you figured out it's too late.

1550
01:26:53.750 --> 01:26:56.000
Yeah,
he's so curious why these guys are so damn good.

1551
01:26:56.001 --> 01:26:59.710
Mike Tyson to you're telling me he was training with Tyson.

1552
01:26:59.780 --> 01:27:03.320
I've seen and do that arm ranch they did on Glover.
I've seen Tyson do that.

1553
01:27:03.321 --> 01:27:06.710
Tyson did Caulfield check yourself.
I remember that.

1554
01:27:06.880 --> 01:27:10.070
Fires a lot of box do a little bit.
They just haven't done it the way John did.

1555
01:27:11.180 --> 01:27:14.680
Illegal way,
clamped his hands together and do it.
I mean he,
uh,

1556
01:27:14.750 --> 01:27:18.800
he's off to put some levers here.
Johnson fucking beast restaurant man.

1557
01:27:19.010 --> 01:27:20.450
He's got a really good grappling.

1558
01:27:20.480 --> 01:27:24.510
The way he manhandled guys inside the clench to ticks guy's down.
He's a beast.

1559
01:27:24.820 --> 01:27:28.100
I think that Alexander Dustin fight was the best thing ever to happen to John.

1560
01:27:28.130 --> 01:27:31.280
John was like,
alright,
I need to pick it up here.
And he has,

1561
01:27:31.760 --> 01:27:34.070
what do you mean by that though?
I think when you,

1562
01:27:34.071 --> 01:27:35.420
when you're going through fights,

1563
01:27:35.421 --> 01:27:37.940
like he was these title shots where he wasn't really getting tested.

1564
01:27:37.940 --> 01:27:41.830
He's destroying guys,
right?
I mean,
it's hard not to believe your own hype.

1565
01:27:41.840 --> 01:27:44.480
Believe me,
I was four,
no knocked out Mirko Cro cop,

1566
01:27:44.481 --> 01:27:47.810
and I thought I was fricking God's gift to the UFC.
And I was like,
all right,

1567
01:27:47.900 --> 01:27:51.110
I'll still training my ass off.
I literally didn't think I could lose.

1568
01:27:51.230 --> 01:27:53.720
It was like,
Eh,
whatever.
Just keep doing my thing.

1569
01:27:53.750 --> 01:27:57.800
Just going to keep knocking everybody out.
It's whatever I feel like John,
man,

1570
01:27:57.801 --> 01:28:01.460
I just slid into that a little bit where you're like,
Bro,
this is dope.

1571
01:28:01.730 --> 01:28:03.080
I'll just destroying everyone.

1572
01:28:03.230 --> 01:28:08.150
And then you get a guy like Alexander who's just as big,
just as long.

1573
01:28:08.300 --> 01:28:10.430
I think John was like,
I need to step my game up here.

1574
01:28:10.610 --> 01:28:15.610
And he just absolutely dismantled clover to chair and that's why maybe it could

1575
01:28:16.041 --> 01:28:20.660
be also a stylistic thing to Gustafson as part of it.
That's part of it for sure.

1576
01:28:20.661 --> 01:28:25.480
Like you said,
John Jones didn't perform like he used to at one seven two man,

1577
01:28:25.490 --> 01:28:28.160
I couldn't agree with that.
Well,
Alexander's just trying to stay right.

1578
01:28:28.161 --> 01:28:30.600
He's trying to hype this fight.
You got to do it anyway.

1579
01:28:30.620 --> 01:28:33.920
He gets the next fight for sure,
but he's been talking to all sorts of smack.

1580
01:28:33.950 --> 01:28:37.310
Yeah.
Well,
of course he's saying he's saying John.
John doesn't want to fight me,

1581
01:28:37.311 --> 01:28:38.940
judge.
I was scared of me.
What else are you going to do?

1582
01:28:38.990 --> 01:28:42.110
What he's gotta say all that.
That's how you hype things up.

1583
01:28:42.111 --> 01:28:43.940
What are you going to do?
It's an interesting fight,
man.

1584
01:28:43.970 --> 01:28:46.160
I'll tell you that after the first fight.
It's an interesting fight.

1585
01:28:46.370 --> 01:28:48.350
I think you're going to see a way better John Jones in this fight,

1586
01:28:48.351 --> 01:28:50.840
but I think you're gonna see a better Gustafson too,
I think.

1587
01:28:50.841 --> 01:28:54.860
I think it won't be as close as well.
I think.
No,
I think one of them,

1588
01:28:54.950 --> 01:28:57.100
I don't think he's to me as close one.
I'm going to pull it.
I,

1589
01:28:57.320 --> 01:29:00.050
I'm not gonna make it pick,
but I think one's going to pull away,
man.

1590
01:29:00.051 --> 01:29:02.160
I don't know.
It could be,
I'll tell you what.

1591
01:29:02.161 --> 01:29:05.790
For BC over dooms a tougher matchup for a cane.
Then Travis Browne,

1592
01:29:05.940 --> 01:29:09.090
it's all about matchups.
I think verb ECO poses a lot of threats that cane,

1593
01:29:09.570 --> 01:29:13.470
you don't realize how big for BCO is.
He's big.
He's big.

1594
01:29:13.620 --> 01:29:15.630
Travis Browne wasn't it that much bigger than him?

1595
01:29:15.690 --> 01:29:18.450
Not that much taller now for Breeshia was light for that fight too.

1596
01:29:18.451 --> 01:29:19.610
He's a little,
he's losing weight.

1597
01:29:19.660 --> 01:29:22.260
You got done at two 30 that's what guys are doing.

1598
01:29:22.261 --> 01:29:26.640
Like in Travis Brown came in at what,
two 30 cardio.
Kate.
Kate.

1599
01:29:26.910 --> 01:29:31.860
It's a copycat league.
So Kayla destroying cats and then everyone's like,
oh,

1600
01:29:31.861 --> 01:29:36.840
that's cool.
I'm 260 pounds.
I can't make it that long.
I can't keep that pace.

1601
01:29:37.200 --> 01:29:38.820
All of a sudden,
everyone's getting lighter canes.

1602
01:29:38.821 --> 01:29:41.580
Cardios very unusual physically too.

1603
01:29:41.860 --> 01:29:46.520
He's got very unusual cardio just from genetics.
He's gifted.
Yes.

1604
01:29:46.580 --> 01:29:50.730
He's not your most explosive athlete,
but in as far as stamina goes,

1605
01:29:50.731 --> 01:29:54.000
he's a tendency say,
puts his head in your chest and just,
he's just so good.

1606
01:29:54.060 --> 01:29:57.510
You know?
He's just such a good fucking athlete.
I mean his,
his,

1607
01:29:57.600 --> 01:30:00.510
his stamina is incredible and it's technique.
Everything throws.

1608
01:30:00.511 --> 01:30:04.350
He doesn't have any wasted motion.
He never see him like pint in his teeth down,

1609
01:30:04.351 --> 01:30:08.580
throwing wild haymakers everything is strong.
Pricing's good.
Perfect technique.

1610
01:30:09.330 --> 01:30:10.190
Right.
Brendan,

1611
01:30:10.250 --> 01:30:12.930
why do you think of his boxing or what's the most impressive part of his game

1612
01:30:12.931 --> 01:30:15.540
besides his cardio for you?
I've seen for me,

1613
01:30:15.870 --> 01:30:18.660
I'll see by his box in his wrestling is amazing stuff like that.

1614
01:30:18.810 --> 01:30:22.320
What's amazing to me is he's,
he never lets the moment get to him.

1615
01:30:22.321 --> 01:30:25.020
I was talking about this,
Brian was asking about the Andrea Alaska,

1616
01:30:25.021 --> 01:30:29.010
you fight and I said this and now that I'm getting a little more experience,

1617
01:30:29.011 --> 01:30:33.960
you know,
this'll be my 10th or 11th fight in the UFC,
which is a lot.
And uh,

1618
01:30:34.120 --> 01:30:36.330
it,
it's not letting the moment get to you.
You don't,

1619
01:30:36.900 --> 01:30:40.830
you don't let the moment gets so big where you get freaked out.

1620
01:30:40.831 --> 01:30:42.960
And that happened to me in Brazil when I bought Nogueira.

1621
01:30:43.080 --> 01:30:45.300
It's the first time ever,
I was like,
what the fuck am I doing?

1622
01:30:45.480 --> 01:30:48.000
Freaked out when they're throwing these crazy up guts.

1623
01:30:48.001 --> 01:30:50.880
I don't even throw uppercuts.
I'll throw in leg kicks.
That's not my thing.

1624
01:30:51.150 --> 01:30:53.790
I'm don't like kicks upper cuts.
Literally I watched that film.
Like,

1625
01:30:53.791 --> 01:30:56.550
who the fuck is that guy?
The moment got to me where I was like,
Dang,

1626
01:30:56.551 --> 01:31:00.090
this is a big moment.
I beat this guy.
Probably going to fight Brock Lesnar neck.

1627
01:31:00.180 --> 01:31:02.450
That's what I was told.
Probably gonna Fight Brock Lesnar neck.
So I'm,

1628
01:31:02.610 --> 01:31:05.890
I'm thinking of all these crazy situations.
That's when the moment get to you.

1629
01:31:06.360 --> 01:31:08.820
So with Andrea [inaudible] and for with,

1630
01:31:08.850 --> 01:31:11.850
you asked what's so impressive about Cain Velasquez?
Dude,

1631
01:31:11.880 --> 01:31:15.660
never have you seen that guy freak out.
Never have you seen them like,
oh,

1632
01:31:15.661 --> 01:31:18.870
what am I going to do and start fighting on unlike himself,

1633
01:31:18.960 --> 01:31:23.760
he sticks to a game plan and mentally he's just so solid.
That's the difference.

1634
01:31:23.790 --> 01:31:24.030
Right?

1635
01:31:24.030 --> 01:31:27.450
Like he said against you and Jill Santos is let this last fight and the third

1636
01:31:27.451 --> 01:31:29.520
round he goes,
man,
I was tired.
I was exhausted.

1637
01:31:29.670 --> 01:31:32.580
But I knew if I kept pushing he couldn't match his pace.

1638
01:31:32.790 --> 01:31:35.160
Well that's a championship mindset.
A lot of the guys.
Yeah,

1639
01:31:35.170 --> 01:31:36.630
I'm going to close it out here and he did it.

1640
01:31:36.750 --> 01:31:40.030
I like what Winkeljohn said that John Jones go out there and have fun.
Yeah,

1641
01:31:40.260 --> 01:31:41.780
they kept saying that that's what it's about.

1642
01:31:41.781 --> 01:31:44.400
He kept saying that and just have fun.
Well,

1643
01:31:44.430 --> 01:31:47.250
he's at his best when he's creative and you know,
and he,

1644
01:31:47.300 --> 01:31:50.190
he knows he's putting on a show and when he's putting on a show with a guy like

1645
01:31:50.200 --> 01:31:50.580
Glover,

1646
01:31:50.580 --> 01:31:53.490
part of the way that it put on a show was do shit that nobody saw coming when he

1647
01:31:53.491 --> 01:31:56.030
put his hands down.
Roy Jones style.
What?

1648
01:31:56.200 --> 01:31:57.400
How about when he got up against the cage?

1649
01:31:57.410 --> 01:32:02.410
Just was Roland with shot that it was phrased pawn blasted him with elbows and

1650
01:32:03.131 --> 01:32:06.240
punches as well.
I mean it was just stellar performance.

1651
01:32:06.250 --> 01:32:08.710
Picked him apart and just show that he's still getting better too.

1652
01:32:08.711 --> 01:32:11.230
Like that was the best he's ever looked.
It's getting better.
I agree.

1653
01:32:11.320 --> 01:32:14.430
Plus he was throwing shit like wheel kicks and stuff that you never saw common,

1654
01:32:14.440 --> 01:32:17.830
you know,
like Jesus Christ,
it's spinning back kick is outstanding now.
Crazy.

1655
01:32:17.880 --> 01:32:21.340
He's,
he's got a really good spinning back kick that,
you know.
Damn.

1656
01:32:21.530 --> 01:32:24.220
So there's so many,
so many,
a really,

1657
01:32:24.221 --> 01:32:27.730
really high level matchups these days and so many fighters getting better every

1658
01:32:27.731 --> 01:32:31.510
time you see him.
It's just you have to,
yeah,
you have to,
you have no choice.

1659
01:32:31.690 --> 01:32:35.170
So that this goes back to that.
So if you're not passionate about the sport,

1660
01:32:35.171 --> 01:32:38.410
especially mixed martial arts,
but in life in general,
if you're not passionate,

1661
01:32:38.470 --> 01:32:41.980
Solon is,
you know what I'm saying?
So you cannot keep up,

1662
01:32:42.160 --> 01:32:44.310
especially in pro sports.
What did you think about,

1663
01:32:44.680 --> 01:32:47.650
what did you think about Edson Barboza Donald's Serone what you think about
that?

1664
01:32:47.651 --> 01:32:50.440
That was crazy.
Yeah.
Is My boy.
Right?
And I always tell Brian this,

1665
01:32:50.530 --> 01:32:52.180
when cowboy walks out from the time,

1666
01:32:52.181 --> 01:32:56.290
I can usually tell if he's going to win or not.
If cowboys mentally ready,

1667
01:32:56.350 --> 01:32:59.320
he's the best one 55 in the world.
To me,
I'll say I'm a little bias.

1668
01:32:59.321 --> 01:33:02.260
I think he's one of the very best in the world when Donald,

1669
01:33:02.830 --> 01:33:07.000
let's the moment get to him.
Donald doesn't fight like Donald,
uh,

1670
01:33:07.150 --> 01:33:10.840
the dos Anjos fight.
That's not Donald.
When he fought Anthony Pettis,

1671
01:33:10.841 --> 01:33:14.740
that's not Donald.
You can just tell he doesn't want to be in there.
This fight,

1672
01:33:14.741 --> 01:33:17.680
I couldn't really tell it was on the fence.
And then when he came out I was like,

1673
01:33:17.770 --> 01:33:20.080
oh no,
he's getting his ass whooped.

1674
01:33:20.260 --> 01:33:23.140
And then this huge jab drops,

1675
01:33:23.740 --> 01:33:27.760
drops Barboza and they ended up taking his back and he took some bombs before

1676
01:33:27.761 --> 01:33:31.330
that took some bombs.
He's getting picked apart.
Well,
he caught some crazy hooks.

1677
01:33:31.331 --> 01:33:33.230
He called and left kicks.

1678
01:33:34.070 --> 01:33:37.330
You could tell Barbara Rose had a speed advantage was mixing it up.
I was like,

1679
01:33:37.331 --> 01:33:40.930
oh no cowboy,
this isn't good.
And then drop them.
Then got his back,

1680
01:33:40.990 --> 01:33:43.510
jumped down on like a spider monkey,
got his back,

1681
01:33:43.511 --> 01:33:45.070
choked him out and everything's all good.

1682
01:33:45.250 --> 01:33:49.150
But now you got Habib number Grumet off.

1683
01:33:49.210 --> 01:33:53.750
Habib cause a mouth.
He's a rough,
Ravi was like rough,
rough.

1684
01:33:53.990 --> 01:33:56.450
Where's he from?
Day period?
They posted this full wrestle.

1685
01:33:56.451 --> 01:33:58.540
A grizzly bear at six ruff

1686
01:34:00.500 --> 01:34:03.280
was playing grab ass with the girls in the playground.

1687
01:34:03.281 --> 01:34:06.580
This fool's wrestling bears.
How can you compete with that head?

1688
01:34:06.640 --> 01:34:10.480
Thank God he's God.
He's at one 55 what's the fuck are we going to do?

1689
01:34:10.540 --> 01:34:15.090
He's so aggressive.
That fucking guy,
his grappling monster,
man,
he beat,

1690
01:34:15.370 --> 01:34:18.250
I mean he made those Angeles,
looked like they weren't in the same league.

1691
01:34:18.920 --> 01:34:22.960
Judge is bad ass.
Yeah,
he is.
Yeah.
The kids got ridiculous.
Grappling,

1692
01:34:22.961 --> 01:34:24.910
some of the best grappling I've ever seen inside the octagon.

1693
01:34:25.140 --> 01:34:28.690
Just so aggressive with his takedowns aggressive and changes things up,

1694
01:34:28.691 --> 01:34:33.340
changes angles and then gives you like a,
a difference in gears.
You know,

1695
01:34:33.341 --> 01:34:37.210
like he switches gears on you.
It was speeds up his approach,
slows it down,

1696
01:34:37.211 --> 01:34:40.030
drops down when you think he's going to stand up.
It just mixes it up.

1697
01:34:40.050 --> 01:34:44.560
Is He trains at eight k and asked dcs core Mia,
we do a show together UFC now.

1698
01:34:44.561 --> 01:34:49.420
And I asked him,
we were doing some breakdowns stuff on,
uh,
could be and I go,

1699
01:34:49.590 --> 01:34:52.380
is he that good?
He is,
he is man.
Cause you,

1700
01:34:52.390 --> 01:34:54.140
and you really haven't seen anything yet in the gym.

1701
01:34:54.141 --> 01:34:58.100
User stomp monster Samo was a great background.
It's one of the best

1702
01:34:58.100 --> 01:35:02.330
<v 1>backgrounds ever for UFC agree because it's high level grappling.</v>

1703
01:35:02.331 --> 01:35:04.850
It was a lot of really tough Russian guys.
You're competing against,

1704
01:35:05.120 --> 01:35:08.600
you're competing with fucking animals and these guys are really good at

1705
01:35:08.930 --> 01:35:12.350
transitioning as a sound,
but I didn't he um,
yeah,

1706
01:35:12.351 --> 01:35:15.900
he was combat sambo world champion.
Yeah.
It was kind of the face of it off.

1707
01:35:16.580 --> 01:35:17.413
That's not real.

1708
01:35:17.450 --> 01:35:21.710
There's an actual video of him as a kid rolling around with a fucking grizzly

1709
01:35:21.711 --> 01:35:25.190
bear and the grizzly bears like defending rear naked chokes and shit.

1710
01:35:25.191 --> 01:35:27.200
This grizzly bears like a blue belt in Jiu Jitsu.

1711
01:35:27.201 --> 01:35:30.980
I don't know where they found this big at the San Diego Zoo and I was watching

1712
01:35:30.981 --> 01:35:33.440
mountain gorillas wrestled the little mountain gorillas,

1713
01:35:33.830 --> 01:35:36.560
the adolescents and the baby.
They have great technique.

1714
01:35:36.561 --> 01:35:40.910
They're just natural wrestlers.
Here it is.
Oh,
really?
Brian,

1715
01:35:41.150 --> 01:35:43.550
while you were playing,
when you were dancing your ass off,

1716
01:35:43.670 --> 01:35:46.730
this guys wrestling with a beer.
Leave the bear double leg.
What?

1717
01:35:46.760 --> 01:35:51.560
That bear is an wait a minute.
That's not him.
Is it?
Is this the right video?

1718
01:35:52.560 --> 01:35:56.600
Youtube says.
I think so,
man.
Let's do one.
The UFC posted.

1719
01:35:56.620 --> 01:36:00.050
That's something he couldn't then Sabib confirmed it that it was him.

1720
01:36:00.640 --> 01:36:04.700
That he's a little kid,
little kid wrestling with the Goddamn bear.
That's insane.

1721
01:36:04.730 --> 01:36:08.180
Right?
That's so cool.
What kind of guy called and yelled at?

1722
01:36:08.181 --> 01:36:12.630
My Dad was a small buck,
was my best.
It's a baby bear still though.
Yeah,

1723
01:36:12.650 --> 01:36:15.260
it's still for sure.
I wouldn't fuck with that,
but they're looking,

1724
01:36:15.270 --> 01:36:16.041
that bears aggressive,

1725
01:36:16.041 --> 01:36:20.390
his shit too strong and it appears like dig in the rest of the role is that

1726
01:36:20.391 --> 01:36:23.950
though.
I want that.
Hey,

1727
01:36:24.240 --> 01:36:25.760
I want to bear badly.
Right,

1728
01:36:26.210 --> 01:36:30.460
because you'd ignore it and be in your backyard waiting [inaudible] come home

1729
01:36:30.830 --> 01:36:33.680
and then one day someone will go into your backyard and not know that the bear

1730
01:36:33.681 --> 01:36:38.080
likes to wrestle people and fucking take him down and scream and I just rode.

1731
01:36:38.090 --> 01:36:42.380
Yeah,
exactly.
I'm enough to have a bear.
That recipe not,

1732
01:36:42.410 --> 01:36:44.350
I'm not home enough to have a pair of the rest of the day.

1733
01:36:44.910 --> 01:36:49.580
I want so badly right now.
Not Home enough,
dude.
It's not fair.
Oh,

1734
01:36:49.581 --> 01:36:53.280
champs.
No bears.
Definitely.
No chimps.
It's just not fair when they're little.

1735
01:36:53.630 --> 01:36:55.730
Who's Johnny Hendricks?
Gonna fight against next?

1736
01:36:56.870 --> 01:37:01.820
Johnny Hendricks we'll fight.
Had a winner of [inaudible].
No,
Hector Lombard.

1737
01:37:01.821 --> 01:37:02.654
Nope.

1738
01:37:02.860 --> 01:37:07.860
Woodley and Roy and Roy MacDonald fight in June 14th on UFC one 74 that shut

1739
01:37:09.471 --> 01:37:12.680
Vancouver.
That's in Vancouver going to be there for that Brian Camp.
Yeah.

1740
01:37:12.681 --> 01:37:14.900
I can't wait the winner of that.
We'll get the next title fight.

1741
01:37:14.901 --> 01:37:19.310
I think Tyron Woodley is about as big as you can get.
And B,
one seven.
He's giant.

1742
01:37:19.790 --> 01:37:23.650
He's a beast.
He's a fucking strong kid too,
man.
Put that shit too.

1743
01:37:24.830 --> 01:37:28.180
But then you also got Jake,
Jake Ellenberger versus um,

1744
01:37:28.320 --> 01:37:32.420
are your boy Robbie Lawler is a tough one.
So many killers.

1745
01:37:32.421 --> 01:37:35.870
Like you start thinking about 71 71 55.

1746
01:37:36.170 --> 01:37:39.200
Y'all better have all your bases covered.
You've gotta be a black belt.

1747
01:37:39.800 --> 01:37:43.000
Can be a hell of an athlete on top of Angie [inaudible].

1748
01:37:43.610 --> 01:37:45.560
Tj Dillashaw fight,
right?

1749
01:37:45.620 --> 01:37:48.740
Isn't that the same card with Jake Ellenberger takes on Robbie Lawler.

1750
01:37:49.700 --> 01:37:52.340
What is this one 74 [inaudible] 74.
Oh yeah,

1751
01:37:52.341 --> 01:37:56.130
see Tj Dillashaw and Robbie Lawler or yeah,
they're on,
they're on the same

1752
01:37:56.140 --> 01:37:59.760
<v 4>[inaudible] you can't get a picture up there.
And how about mighty mouse?
Man,</v>

1753
01:37:59.850 --> 01:38:02.690
he might be the best pound for pound guy on the of planet.
He's good.

1754
01:38:02.730 --> 01:38:05.130
You might be the most technical pound for pound fighter in the plant.
I mean,

1755
01:38:05.131 --> 01:38:08.010
everybody always turns to the big ones.

1756
01:38:08.011 --> 01:38:12.150
Beaning Barao Joe say Aldo and Jon Jones.
But the smaller you go,

1757
01:38:12.151 --> 01:38:16.380
the more talented they are.
My mouth.
I agree.

1758
01:38:16.530 --> 01:38:19.620
It might be the best.
Rarely knocked out Benevidez with the flux on that comment.

1759
01:38:19.770 --> 01:38:22.950
Who's ever done that,
but you don't see too many knockouts,

1760
01:38:23.310 --> 01:38:25.860
especially at that level.
And he tastes guys down.

1761
01:38:25.861 --> 01:38:30.030
Submits them to in the fourth round against Morocco and he went to war with John

1762
01:38:30.030 --> 01:38:32.190
Moraga,
then went to war.
He eventually,
you know,

1763
01:38:32.191 --> 01:38:35.070
it's overcoming them with with technique and then he catches them on the ground.

1764
01:38:35.200 --> 01:38:37.470
What is it heading the fight and he's still finishing him with an arm bar.

1765
01:38:37.820 --> 01:38:39.660
It's crazy and barrancas fucking dangerous.

1766
01:38:39.720 --> 01:38:44.490
Berakah caught him clean with a straight punch right to the mug and he ate it

1767
01:38:44.760 --> 01:38:47.750
readjusted.
Yup.
Great fight back.
Good fight.
Really.

1768
01:38:47.790 --> 01:38:50.500
He's fucking technical shit man.
He's technical launch.

1769
01:38:50.640 --> 01:38:54.690
Really technical and just does having that Guy Matt Hume as your trainer from

1770
01:38:54.691 --> 01:38:59.010
jump from,
it's so big.
It's huge.
Like I know so much to base for you.
Right.

1771
01:38:59.160 --> 01:39:02.960
And they know so much.
First of all,
he was a very good fighter himself.
Moist,

1772
01:39:02.970 --> 01:39:06.810
both Moitai Jiu Jitsu.
He did MMA,
fought in a,

1773
01:39:06.811 --> 01:39:08.790
I think he fought an extreme fighting.
He fought pat military.

1774
01:39:08.791 --> 01:39:10.060
She's stopped Pat Miller to distribute the,

1775
01:39:10.350 --> 01:39:13.950
broke his nose with a neat old school.
He's really good.
But his knowledge,

1776
01:39:13.951 --> 01:39:18.750
he also was a judge and pride for a long time.
Judged a lot of fights in prod.

1777
01:39:18.751 --> 01:39:22.290
You would always see Matt,
he was stoic look guy.
He would,
the way he behaved,

1778
01:39:22.291 --> 01:39:25.650
he's just always struck me as very stoic like smart dude.
Yeah.

1779
01:39:26.020 --> 01:39:27.180
That was a lot of shit about fighting.

1780
01:39:27.420 --> 01:39:29.760
You hear him in the corner when he's given advice to some of the best advice

1781
01:39:29.761 --> 01:39:33.280
you'll ever hear.
Really?
Yeah.
Very technical.
Very uh,

1782
01:39:33.720 --> 01:39:37.890
very much you could tell that they've trained for a very specific style of,

1783
01:39:37.891 --> 01:39:41.130
of game plan and how to adjust,
you know,
makes adjustments.

1784
01:39:41.131 --> 01:39:42.480
Has a plant's be plans.

1785
01:39:42.481 --> 01:39:46.560
Like you could tell like the way there when he's talking about Dj and uh,

1786
01:39:46.650 --> 01:39:49.830
when he was fighting Benevidez,
you know,
the Bellevue is loading up,
you know,

1787
01:39:49.831 --> 01:39:53.010
like they saw it coming.
What's,
what's weird to meet.
We're not weird,

1788
01:39:53.011 --> 01:39:56.910
but what's cool is the relationship between coaches and fighters.

1789
01:39:56.911 --> 01:39:59.130
Like a coach would know what to say to a fighter,
right?

1790
01:39:59.131 --> 01:40:00.810
Like some guys need to be hyped up.

1791
01:40:01.170 --> 01:40:03.580
Some guys need to be hyped up where the coach is yelling and screaming.

1792
01:40:03.590 --> 01:40:05.160
I'm in between rounds doing stuff like that.

1793
01:40:05.340 --> 01:40:09.480
That can be super negative and then other ones are super calm,
relaxed,

1794
01:40:09.510 --> 01:40:13.860
very Greg Jackson is,
and just the difference between,
that's crazy.

1795
01:40:14.220 --> 01:40:18.780
When I was on the ultimate fighter at a coach,
yell at me and slap the shit,

1796
01:40:19.080 --> 01:40:23.340
slapped me so hard it,
it literally rocked me before walking in the octagon.

1797
01:40:23.450 --> 01:40:26.700
He slapped me so hard.
It's a little spazzy.
It was like,
come on,
let's go.

1798
01:40:26.790 --> 01:40:31.730
That's not,
that isn't working.
I was like,
Trevor Whitman,
did he really?

1799
01:40:31.760 --> 01:40:32.730
I was like,
Huh.

1800
01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:36.260
I see out of his fucking life literally doing and that when the octagon,

1801
01:40:36.380 --> 01:40:41.220
you went down to the right,
what are we doing that works with clay?

1802
01:40:41.240 --> 01:40:41.491
Guido?

1803
01:40:41.491 --> 01:40:46.491
Maybe like his brother [inaudible] brother only slaps him like 20% he's not like

1804
01:40:46.801 --> 01:40:50.460
really cocky him in the head.
He's just slap,
slap,
slap,
slap and get him.
I mean,

1805
01:40:50.850 --> 01:40:54.190
he's not hurting his brother,
right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Some guys

1806
01:40:54.190 --> 01:40:57.430
<v 3>like that.
Like if you watch box and if you watch that Garcia,</v>

1807
01:40:57.580 --> 01:41:02.000
who's a the,
what's the name of Madonna?
Madonna.
Madonna.

1808
01:41:02.500 --> 01:41:05.890
Yeah.
Robert Garcia.
Have you seen the way he coaches guys?
Very good.

1809
01:41:05.920 --> 01:41:09.250
Very good coach.
A great coach.
He works with Kane recently.

1810
01:41:09.340 --> 01:41:12.740
Instead of cane took three years off.
He could be heavyweight champion.
Wow.

1811
01:41:12.760 --> 01:41:17.110
It's a boxer.
Yeah.
Three years.
I'll have to get them,
get them the right fights,

1812
01:41:17.111 --> 01:41:21.970
build them up strong for three years.
He'd be heavyweight.
Yeah.
That's crazy.
Yeah.

1813
01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:26.570
I mean the heavy,
the heavyweight boxing pictures please.
Bladimir Ma,

1814
01:41:26.600 --> 01:41:30.640
what is his name?
Cloudberry.
He's a beast.
He's a fucking beast.

1815
01:41:30.670 --> 01:41:34.660
Is a very good boxer.
Klitschko yes.
No one.
No one.
No one in MMA.

1816
01:41:34.680 --> 01:41:38.240
Searing a peep out of Klitschko.
He's going to destroy guys.
So how was,
uh,

1817
01:41:38.320 --> 01:41:41.710
how was Robert Garcia think that came to Alaska is going to beat Klitschko well,

1818
01:41:41.711 --> 01:41:45.640
what else is he going to say?
I mean,
if this boy,
I don't know.
That's a stretch.

1819
01:41:45.700 --> 01:41:47.710
That's a stretch.
It's an interesting thing.
It,

1820
01:41:47.800 --> 01:41:49.030
I would like to see them try to do it.

1821
01:41:49.480 --> 01:41:52.990
I would think that'd be fascinating to see what he could do a lot of reach to

1822
01:41:52.991 --> 01:41:57.150
deal with for cane.
By the way,
a lot of rich those clips goes fight

1823
01:41:58.670 --> 01:42:01.420
very few punches.
They,
the pitch goes just that,

1824
01:42:01.690 --> 01:42:05.050
that jab and then really conservative.
I have a buddy,

1825
01:42:05.051 --> 01:42:07.690
this is a funny story about the Klitschkos have a very good friend.

1826
01:42:07.691 --> 01:42:12.460
I played college football was when I first came to la.
He was dating,
uh,
at the,

1827
01:42:12.560 --> 01:42:16.570
it's Klitschkos fiance now or why?
I know they got married,
Hayden penitentiary.

1828
01:42:16.750 --> 01:42:19.750
He was dating her and uh,

1829
01:42:20.680 --> 01:42:23.200
he's gonna kill me for telling this story.
I won't tell a story then.
Well,

1830
01:42:23.201 --> 01:42:28.090
it's not too bad.
It's not too bad.
So,
so he,
he,
he's dating this girl.

1831
01:42:28.120 --> 01:42:32.470
Klich gone her are not dating and he thinks he's all paranoid.

1832
01:42:32.471 --> 01:42:35.980
He's all worried cause fricking Klitschko.
And so he,
uh,

1833
01:42:35.990 --> 01:42:39.040
cars behind him and he doesn't know if this is true or not,

1834
01:42:39.041 --> 01:42:42.550
but he thinks Klitschko Hasko and tailor them.
You know what I'm saying?

1835
01:42:42.551 --> 01:42:46.870
So he calls me up,
Bro,
get over here,
man.

1836
01:42:46.990 --> 01:42:51.070
I think something's bad to go down for.
You know me.
I'm like,
what?
He's like,
yeah,

1837
01:42:51.090 --> 01:42:54.550
he's about to go down.
He goes,
I think you know I'm dating this girl.

1838
01:42:54.670 --> 01:42:56.620
I think her ex boyfriend at the time,

1839
01:42:56.621 --> 01:42:58.600
I had no idea who was dating or what he's talking about.
He goes,

1840
01:42:58.720 --> 01:43:01.150
I think your ex boyfriends trailing Nagel.
Who the fuck's her ex boyfriend?

1841
01:43:01.450 --> 01:43:05.490
He was Klitschko they'll fight the heavyweight boxer.
He goes,
Yo,
Yo,

1842
01:43:05.650 --> 01:43:09.770
I'm not fucking coming down there.
He goes,
yeah bro,
you can take them now.
No,

1843
01:43:09.850 --> 01:43:13.570
I liked that die.
And if you're talking with this girl,
that's what she can't,
man.

1844
01:43:13.910 --> 01:43:18.270
No Man,
I got the phone.

1845
01:43:18.280 --> 01:43:21.940
Six six two 43.
It's a baby boy.
It,
man,

1846
01:43:22.930 --> 01:43:25.190
that's a lot to tell it.
And uh,

1847
01:43:25.430 --> 01:43:28.320
just one ridiculous fifth round,

1848
01:43:28.500 --> 01:43:32.710
you know who we should be talking about is Bernard Hopkins at 49 one another

1849
01:43:32.711 --> 01:43:35.970
title.
It's so ridiculous.
How's he doing that?
Brenton Chubb.

1850
01:43:36.040 --> 01:43:39.760
How the fuck is he doing that?
How's it Bernard Hopkins winning titles are 49.

1851
01:43:39.761 --> 01:43:40.594
Tell me.

1852
01:43:41.620 --> 01:43:45.190
He's training smart and it just is Reenie ring experience.

1853
01:43:45.350 --> 01:43:49.570
He's just destroying youngsters.
Right?
But isn't that incredible?
49 years old.

1854
01:43:49.571 --> 01:43:53.020
Incredible thing.
How good.
How could it be?
Straight training.
I agree.

1855
01:43:53.030 --> 01:43:55.670
Speeding guys in his twenties I can't explain it.

1856
01:43:57.210 --> 01:43:59.060
He's destroying guys.
I can't explain it.

1857
01:43:59.270 --> 01:44:01.640
He dropped the dude in the 11th round circles.

1858
01:44:02.490 --> 01:44:04.970
He looks a little old in that picture.
Look at him.
He's just going to say,

1859
01:44:04.990 --> 01:44:07.510
don't look that old.
He was old enough.
It's just the grain.
His beard,

1860
01:44:07.530 --> 01:44:10.940
he shave his beard off.
He doesn't look old at all.
I agree.
So weird thing.

1861
01:44:11.580 --> 01:44:14.210
How three weeks,
but he's doing something that nobody's done in sports.

1862
01:44:14.211 --> 01:44:15.440
It ever maybe.
Well,

1863
01:44:15.441 --> 01:44:19.760
he's also said that he doesn't need to work out the way everybody works out.

1864
01:44:19.761 --> 01:44:22.730
Like everybody has this idea that you have to work out hours every day.
He goes,

1865
01:44:22.731 --> 01:44:25.040
I was every day for 30 minute fight.
Like why?

1866
01:44:25.050 --> 01:44:26.300
You got to work out hours every day.

1867
01:44:26.600 --> 01:44:31.600
So he's figured out how to maintain enough fitness to go a 30 minute fights.

1868
01:44:31.940 --> 01:44:35.910
That's all he does.
All he has to do is get in shape.
Yup.
What's he gonna do?

1869
01:44:35.911 --> 01:44:39.590
What are they gonna do?
[inaudible] he's Mass Boston.

1870
01:44:39.680 --> 01:44:41.420
He's putting his 10,000 hours.

1871
01:44:41.780 --> 01:44:45.380
He's mastered boxing and now he just and stayed.

1872
01:44:45.800 --> 01:44:49.910
He's never been really hurt.
He's never been really like Malden knocked out,

1873
01:44:49.911 --> 01:44:53.510
knocked out.
And as far as the training goes,
it's,
it's funny to me,
I was,

1874
01:44:53.540 --> 01:44:55.640
I had this strength condition coach.
I still work with them.

1875
01:44:56.410 --> 01:45:00.170
Andre would are crazy and he would make be trained for an hour and a half.

1876
01:45:00.230 --> 01:45:02.360
The circuit,
we do like 12 rounds,

1877
01:45:02.570 --> 01:45:06.950
these circuit crazy ass things and I'm loving it.
Right.
I just love to work.

1878
01:45:06.960 --> 01:45:07.880
I'm doing it.
I'm doing it.

1879
01:45:08.240 --> 01:45:11.360
And this guy who doesn't know shit about the FC nursing EOC goes,

1880
01:45:11.570 --> 01:45:15.350
what are you getting ready for man?
I got a fight coming up.
He goes,
Oh yeah,

1881
01:45:15.530 --> 01:45:20.270
a 12 round fight,
huh?
No,
no,
that's only three rounds.
He goes,
oh,

1882
01:45:20.271 --> 01:45:24.500
like 10 minute rounds or you know,
they're a three five minute rounds.
He goes,

1883
01:45:25.150 --> 01:45:27.080
and you've been here for about,
you've been here longer than me,
man.
I'm,

1884
01:45:27.081 --> 01:45:30.350
how long have you been [inaudible]?
I'm an hour and a half.
He goes,
oh,

1885
01:45:30.351 --> 01:45:32.420
that's cool.
And I could tell he was like,
what?

1886
01:45:32.640 --> 01:45:36.490
<v 2>And then went into the locker room.
I was like,</v>

1887
01:45:36.860 --> 01:45:38.220
this guy is totally right.

1888
01:45:39.240 --> 01:45:44.030
Jackass who has no idea what the fuck are we doing.

1889
01:45:44.080 --> 01:45:46.770
So I sat down with my coach and was like,
Yo man,
my fights,

1890
01:45:46.771 --> 01:45:50.700
15 minutes been in for an hour and a half doing all this crazy shit.

1891
01:45:50.940 --> 01:45:55.080
We need to cut that down.
Tim Ferriss did this,

1892
01:45:55.100 --> 01:45:59.190
like he looked at how much Olympic track athletes when they're,

1893
01:45:59.250 --> 01:46:01.490
when the strength training and they lift heavy weights to lot.

1894
01:46:01.710 --> 01:46:04.380
He was took a look at how much they actually are spending.

1895
01:46:05.250 --> 01:46:06.780
Like if you actually time,

1896
01:46:06.781 --> 01:46:09.570
the amount of time they're lifting weights for the weights are in the air.

1897
01:46:10.260 --> 01:46:14.730
It's something really crazy.
Like 20 minutes a month.
Like it's very,

1898
01:46:14.731 --> 01:46:18.230
very little there.
They're maxing out.
But then that's different though.

1899
01:46:18.231 --> 01:46:21.900
That's just
a little different weights though.

1900
01:46:23.140 --> 01:46:25.260
It doesn't take day.
No,
I'm not saying that.

1901
01:46:25.261 --> 01:46:27.510
I'm saying it doesn't like for strength training when they're trying to get

1902
01:46:27.511 --> 01:46:30.300
stronger.
What's interesting is that power lifting and stuff,

1903
01:46:30.301 --> 01:46:33.840
they don't lift as much nearly as much as you think,
eh.
You know,
it's,
it's,

1904
01:46:33.841 --> 01:46:38.210
it's the right,
that's not what he's talking about at all.
Well,
he's fighting.

1905
01:46:38.760 --> 01:46:39.970
He's talking about to overtrain.
No,
no,
no.

1906
01:46:39.971 --> 01:46:43.800
He's talking about rounds where you're fighting like it's totally unrelevant.

1907
01:46:44.970 --> 01:46:47.020
Well,
what I'm saying is they hold up over Crisco

1908
01:46:47.410 --> 01:46:50.160
<v 3>chaos.
Look up Vladimir Klitschko</v>

1909
01:46:50.160 --> 01:46:53.440
<v 4>returns three belts and ESPN.
You got to see the highlight of him fucking stop.</v>

1910
01:46:53.441 --> 01:46:54.274
And that dude,

1911
01:46:54.330 --> 01:46:58.410
what's amazing about Bernard Hopkins is that he's able to control the pace of

1912
01:46:58.411 --> 01:47:00.780
every fight he gets in.
Even if the guy's really good,

1913
01:47:00.781 --> 01:47:03.910
he's able to control the pace of the fight.
Like to know his diet.
Yeah.

1914
01:47:04.110 --> 01:47:07.230
What are we doing here?
Well,
he's very into healthy foods.
You know,

1915
01:47:07.231 --> 01:47:10.050
he doesn't eat anything processed.
He doesn't need anything stupid.

1916
01:47:10.051 --> 01:47:13.030
He doesn't drink.
He doesn't do drugs.
She doesn't fuck around hardy or anything.

1917
01:47:13.620 --> 01:47:16.990
He was Floyd Mayweather doesn't drink,
doesn't do drugs.
Smart when he,

1918
01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:19.200
but he doesn't eat fast food.
That drives me nuts.
Yeah.

1919
01:47:19.201 --> 01:47:22.500
I think probably a lot of it he does for the to camera.
I think he's being silly.

1920
01:47:22.650 --> 01:47:25.380
I bet he does a lot of it for the camera.
What did this look at?
Klitschko

1921
01:47:27.210 --> 01:47:31.680
look at that.
That Jack,
he's so big,
man,
he just so long and tall.

1922
01:47:32.610 --> 01:47:36.720
Check this shit out.
Does light up,
tink tink.

1923
01:47:38.170 --> 01:47:42.450
He's so long,
dude.
He sold.
Like I said,

1924
01:47:42.451 --> 01:47:46.320
you get one shot and it's in front of millions of people for a lot of money

1925
01:47:47.930 --> 01:47:48.870
in Hopkins.

1926
01:47:49.530 --> 01:47:54.530
Hopkins beat Kelly Pavlick and after the fight he grabbed him and they said,

1927
01:47:54.661 --> 01:47:56.970
what'd you say it?
He goes,
he said what?
He said in his hair as he goes,

1928
01:47:56.971 --> 01:47:59.970
don't let this ruin you.
Like in other words,

1929
01:47:59.971 --> 01:48:03.720
I outclass to completely and you are a hit man and a killer.
And he goes,

1930
01:48:04.020 --> 01:48:07.050
don't let this ruin tele.
Pavlik had a problem with alcohol.

1931
01:48:07.051 --> 01:48:11.600
That was as big as I only had happened apparently.

1932
01:48:12.160 --> 01:48:14.640
No,
it's weird.
I always had a problem with that.

1933
01:48:15.440 --> 01:48:17.180
Everyone knows a hitman is still a killer.

1934
01:48:17.181 --> 01:48:20.640
It's gonna be tough to be a champion to have alcohol issue.
Yeah,

1935
01:48:20.641 --> 01:48:25.641
you can [inaudible] you guys got like Bernard Hopkins who's going to bed at 7:00

1936
01:48:27.300 --> 01:48:29.310
PM.
You know what I'm saying?
Waking up at six running and shit.

1937
01:48:29.340 --> 01:48:34.140
I'm just saying that Barry was still a killer.
Same areas,

1938
01:48:34.141 --> 01:48:36.470
but not hot.
But meanwhile,
you know,

1939
01:48:36.471 --> 01:48:40.110
you do boxing math the same as you try to do a MMA math.
Uh,

1940
01:48:40.170 --> 01:48:42.590
Jermaine Taylor beat Hopkins twice.
Yep.

1941
01:48:42.660 --> 01:48:47.040
And Kelly Pavlik knocked out Jermaine Taylor.
It's weird.
Yeah,
it is.
It's,

1942
01:48:47.450 --> 01:48:49.350
it's boxing,
math and it's also,

1943
01:48:49.650 --> 01:48:54.650
I think Kelly Pavlik caught Jermaine Taylor after Jermaine Taylor had had his

1944
01:48:54.811 --> 01:48:58.020
bell rung enough.
There's a number.
Well,
you've just,

1945
01:48:58.021 --> 01:49:02.310
you hit the wall and there's no coming back.
And when Pavlik stopped him,

1946
01:49:02.311 --> 01:49:04.590
it was one of those,
Ooh,
this might be the end.

1947
01:49:04.620 --> 01:49:07.990
It was one of those where you see the end of a fighter's career sometimes in one

1948
01:49:08.090 --> 01:49:09.930
stoppage.
He,
no,
not always.
Right.

1949
01:49:10.260 --> 01:49:12.810
Like packy Al came back after the mark has knocked out.

1950
01:49:12.840 --> 01:49:15.720
A lot of people predicted he would never,
a lot of people said,
this is it,

1951
01:49:15.721 --> 01:49:19.440
this is the end.
But he's got a really fucking smart trainer and Freddie Roach,

1952
01:49:19.441 --> 01:49:21.840
he said,
take a year off.
Took a whole year.

1953
01:49:23.090 --> 01:49:27.980
So he wasn't even boxing and he didn't know contact for long.
Freddie.

1954
01:49:28.020 --> 01:49:30.870
And uh,
George started to be the same way towards the end of his career.

1955
01:49:30.900 --> 01:49:33.380
They only spar and camp and Freddy only smart.

1956
01:49:33.390 --> 01:49:36.420
Has this guys sparked the last four weeks before a fight?
Smart.

1957
01:49:36.510 --> 01:49:37.850
Is that super smart?
Yeah.

1958
01:49:37.880 --> 01:49:41.480
I don't understand the logic because sparring so important.

1959
01:49:41.610 --> 01:49:42.420
You're doing Mitt work.

1960
01:49:42.420 --> 01:49:45.950
You don't admit we're doing everything on combination and you can actually go up

1961
01:49:46.750 --> 01:49:48.070
in cause it feels like when

1962
01:49:48.070 --> 01:49:50.950
<v 3>somebody is hitting you back,
well when you're at that level,</v>

1963
01:49:51.460 --> 01:49:53.650
what do it same with the NFL when you're at that level,

1964
01:49:53.651 --> 01:49:56.500
why take Bron brain trauma and the NFL,

1965
01:49:56.650 --> 01:50:00.520
most of them don't hit during during the season.
They only hit on Sundays.
Listen,

1966
01:50:00.521 --> 01:50:04.180
if you can't fucking make a tackle on Monday you're sure as shit and I can make

1967
01:50:04.181 --> 01:50:07.660
it on Sunday when it counts with Freddie Roach does with his fighters.

1968
01:50:07.661 --> 01:50:11.160
If you watch like any of those Hbo,
24 Sevens,
I love them.

1969
01:50:11.320 --> 01:50:15.160
They can sell me on anything.
Yeah,
they're great.
He does a lot of positions.

1970
01:50:15.400 --> 01:50:18.580
I kilter out tap and then step hook and they'll go over this,

1971
01:50:18.730 --> 01:50:21.730
this one particular combination that they feel is gonna apply to their opponent

1972
01:50:21.731 --> 01:50:22.720
over and over and over again.

1973
01:50:22.870 --> 01:50:25.930
And they develop it so that it becomes like sort of a secondary reflex.

1974
01:50:25.931 --> 01:50:30.150
So they'll,
they'll do a lot of like specific stuff for each individual fighter.

1975
01:50:30.340 --> 01:50:33.760
The 24 seven has kind of it,
it was at an a plus.

1976
01:50:33.761 --> 01:50:38.080
I give it an a minus now B plus cause all access on showtime.

1977
01:50:38.081 --> 01:50:40.900
Floyd Mayweather took his business there.
If you watch last night,

1978
01:50:40.901 --> 01:50:45.190
episode three with soy may then Ms. Jackson is in the picture anymore.

1979
01:50:45.340 --> 01:50:48.190
And you know why he released it today?
So it,

1980
01:50:48.191 --> 01:50:52.810
Ms. Jackson was his main chick right forever.
She was on all the countdowns,

1981
01:50:53.050 --> 01:50:53.441
whatever.

1982
01:50:53.441 --> 01:50:56.560
This pretty girl take him shop and show her like in Protestant and all this

1983
01:50:56.561 --> 01:51:01.360
money,
whoop whoop,
whoop whoop.
And then she's not there anymore.

1984
01:51:01.361 --> 01:51:03.850
He's like,
we just had our differences.
She's not around anymore.

1985
01:51:03.970 --> 01:51:07.270
So Twitter was blown up like Yo why,
what's wrong with Ms. Jackson?

1986
01:51:07.271 --> 01:51:10.300
I guess she was talking shit about Floyd.
So Floyd is like,
what?

1987
01:51:10.510 --> 01:51:11.680
This is what happened.

1988
01:51:11.860 --> 01:51:16.540
She was pregnant with twins and decide to have an abortion without my consent.

1989
01:51:16.720 --> 01:51:19.360
I want to have these babies.
She had an abortion without my consent.

1990
01:51:19.510 --> 01:51:24.220
That's why we're not fucking together.
And then she is,
yeah,
get ready for this.

1991
01:51:24.221 --> 01:51:29.221
Then she on Instagram is Jackson posts a picture talking shit to Floyd with her

1992
01:51:29.651 --> 01:51:33.220
new man Nelly.
Right.
I'm all into this shit by the way.

1993
01:51:33.230 --> 01:51:35.290
I'm like TMZ and the fight world of it.

1994
01:51:35.410 --> 01:51:40.330
So then she posts pictures with Nellie and then Floyd's like he a picture.
Yeah.

1995
01:51:40.331 --> 01:51:44.920
Ms. Jackson looks great.
Before I paid for all these fucking plastic surgeries,

1996
01:51:45.160 --> 01:51:48.280
shows the picture of her just busted,

1997
01:51:48.400 --> 01:51:52.180
just straight up busted like in the morning,
just one eye open.

1998
01:51:52.181 --> 01:51:54.940
Just a real warlocks state in the morning,

1999
01:51:55.240 --> 01:51:58.540
posted that picture and then he took it down though.
He took it down.

2000
01:51:58.541 --> 01:52:01.480
When you're having an Instagram fight that's kind of,
that's pretty low.

2001
01:52:02.230 --> 01:52:06.800
It's not enough.
It's not good.
But that's,
people love it.

2002
01:52:06.810 --> 01:52:09.880
Dot out there that she had an abortion with his twins,
his heart.

2003
01:52:11.290 --> 01:52:14.250
I think he was getting so much backlash.
Like what the,
Oh,
you're too good,

2004
01:52:14.290 --> 01:52:17.110
blah blah.
So he's like,
what are should I think she said something to interview,

2005
01:52:17.111 --> 01:52:21.980
so he's like,
oh,
really?
Checked this sound.
Bam,
that fight.
He had dad.

2006
01:52:22.570 --> 01:52:26.230
Dad comes over and they start talking and out of nowhere they're both rack room.

2007
01:52:27.700 --> 01:52:30.780
That's rough.
That's rough.
Chicken ads.

2008
01:52:30.910 --> 01:52:33.520
Chicken had to get you a Floyd Mayweather and fuck with him.
He's,

2009
01:52:33.760 --> 01:52:37.150
he's mastered chicken head.
He has a black belt.
Chicken heads.
I'm a blue belt.

2010
01:52:37.260 --> 01:52:39.260
It's much more than a chicken head,
don't you think?
That's a,

2011
01:52:39.270 --> 01:52:42.220
that's a really crazy situation.
She can head.

2012
01:52:42.340 --> 01:52:45.750
That's a chicken that's been together a long time.
That's that's

2013
01:52:47.750 --> 01:52:51.080
<v 2>because they were together and she was allowed to have all the side pieces.</v>

2014
01:52:51.081 --> 01:52:53.780
That's how I become Ms. Jackson.
That's how you've kind of Ms. Floyd Mayweather.

2015
01:52:53.900 --> 01:52:58.430
She accepted that lifestyle and then she wanted to do her own modeling thing and

2016
01:52:58.431 --> 01:52:59.180
all this stuff,

2017
01:52:59.180 --> 01:53:03.200
so he suspended her from the countdown show just before she was an on there and

2018
01:53:03.201 --> 01:53:05.570
they asked why.
He goes,
you know what she just said to prove her worth.

2019
01:53:05.571 --> 01:53:07.190
She was getting little too big for her Britches,

2020
01:53:07.280 --> 01:53:10.220
so I have to suspend it from the countdown show.
That'd be a chicken head.

2021
01:53:11.190 --> 01:53:13.760
He has a black belt and chicken heads.
Boise knees step your game up.

2022
01:53:13.761 --> 01:53:14.900
You're suspended.

2023
01:53:15.320 --> 01:53:20.320
It's so fucked when you involve babies and stuff into that equation and try to

2024
01:53:20.631 --> 01:53:23.450
figure out like where where that,
how that factored in.

2025
01:53:23.840 --> 01:53:28.280
You know what point are you like,
listen,
I'm the king of chicken heads.
Bitch.

2026
01:53:28.281 --> 01:53:32.030
You're suspended from the countdown shows.
Who has that talk?
Hey listen,

2027
01:53:32.090 --> 01:53:36.680
all access to be here and we need to get out.
Why you acting like chicken head?

2028
01:53:36.860 --> 01:53:39.980
Get the hell Outta here.
Wow,
that's hilarious.

2029
01:53:40.010 --> 01:53:44.930
Managing your employees chicken,
I guess man,

2030
01:53:47.210 --> 01:53:48.110
shop.
You got a pair of,

2031
01:53:48.111 --> 01:53:50.890
I just want to bring it to the attention of the listeners.

2032
01:53:50.940 --> 01:53:54.230
It you're wearing a pair of fairy tied camouflage camouflage shorts.

2033
01:53:54.231 --> 01:53:57.260
I really appreciate that.
No shocks.
Yeah,

2034
01:53:57.261 --> 01:53:59.990
you're very happy with the legs and those Camo shorts though.

2035
01:53:59.991 --> 01:54:04.790
Let's talk about the,
I met those quads,
son.
Hmm.
That's a shit.
Low slung,

2036
01:54:05.300 --> 01:54:08.270
low slung tank top.
Yeah.
Well my Dick's hanging out the front.

2037
01:54:08.271 --> 01:54:11.220
It's whatever the necklace.
Yeah,
it is.

2038
01:54:11.450 --> 01:54:16.190
It is sad when you see those fucking relationships,
those crazy relationships,

2039
01:54:16.430 --> 01:54:20.150
especially when there are aired in front of 20 million so dark,

2040
01:54:20.151 --> 01:54:22.880
like what you're doing,
you know,
just started.

2041
01:54:22.881 --> 01:54:26.380
The cameras are on and he starts talking about abortion.
Listen.

2042
01:54:28.630 --> 01:54:33.410
Oh.
They say that's Floyd's biggest problem is women.
Ah,
yeah.

2043
01:54:33.600 --> 01:54:38.600
It's every famous athletes problem is people like you start to see what they're

2044
01:54:38.811 --> 01:54:41.930
really about as as the,
as the theme starts to wane,

2045
01:54:42.260 --> 01:54:46.100
like Bruce Jenner deciding that he's going to go transgender.

2046
01:54:46.250 --> 01:54:49.960
There's that for sure.
Now,
is he really trying?
No,
no,
he's not.
Brian,

2047
01:54:49.970 --> 01:54:51.590
you just making that up and you're going to get in trouble.

2048
01:54:51.620 --> 01:54:54.250
What do you mean I'm getting in trouble?
I thought even now that I did,

2049
01:54:54.350 --> 01:54:57.770
I did hear that.
You seen the video?
Have you seen the pictures?
Rumors,
man.

2050
01:54:57.850 --> 01:55:00.500
It's just rumors.
Have you done research on this?

2051
01:55:00.501 --> 01:55:04.310
You're talking about a man's body and his aspirations from Pete towards being

2052
01:55:04.311 --> 01:55:07.670
another woman.
There's no statements.
There's nothing you're going to find online.

2053
01:55:08.250 --> 01:55:12.500
I'm going to say Jenga.
Say this.
Ready?
I'm going to say,
I'll tell you this.

2054
01:55:12.501 --> 01:55:15.320
He says mining a Malibu.
I'm gonna say this right now.
Listen Up.
Okay.

2055
01:55:16.250 --> 01:55:19.370
I know somebody very well.
Very well.

2056
01:55:21.080 --> 01:55:23.120
I gotta be careful,
but I know somebody very well.

2057
01:55:23.150 --> 01:55:26.690
Please be careful who is very close to that family.
Okay,

2058
01:55:27.290 --> 01:55:31.250
and should you be saying this for sure?
I think it's okay.
Okay.
I think it's okay.

2059
01:55:31.251 --> 01:55:36.140
I'm being general.
Okay.
And they told me and I said the same thing you said,

2060
01:55:36.890 --> 01:55:41.660
I went that,
are you crazy?
Take a look please.
Let's take a look.

2061
01:55:41.690 --> 01:55:44.010
I went,
that could just be him in the middle

2062
01:55:44.010 --> 01:55:46.320
<v 4>of a conversation and he makes a fucking weird face.</v>

2063
01:55:46.560 --> 01:55:49.590
And then someone captured it and then put it up and made it like it was a bit,

2064
01:55:50.260 --> 01:55:55.200
hopefully the week.
Hold on,
hold on,
please.
Hold on.
Please hold.
Hold.

2065
01:55:55.500 --> 01:55:57.960
So I went.
Interesting.
Why are you talking about this guy?

2066
01:55:57.990 --> 01:56:01.430
Why are you even focusing on his sexuality?
Oh,
I'm just,
what is it?

2067
01:56:01.431 --> 01:56:03.720
Why are you getting all politically,
you don't know the guy.

2068
01:56:03.750 --> 01:56:05.640
I find it very interesting,
but you don't know him.

2069
01:56:05.910 --> 01:56:09.720
So I just think it's interesting and surprising that that Bruce Jenner,

2070
01:56:09.870 --> 01:56:14.640
maybe so what were the facts they toasting to what would they see?

2071
01:56:14.641 --> 01:56:19.510
The fact that he has decided he is going to go,

2072
01:56:20.430 --> 01:56:24.540
uh,
transgender.
Come on and I sent it and,
and,

2073
01:56:24.541 --> 01:56:28.890
and then subsequently I've read it.
Well,
it might be the,
that you streams down.

2074
01:56:29.070 --> 01:56:33.660
Do you know that it keeps cutting off?
Jimmy might be,
no,
no,
no.

2075
01:56:33.661 --> 01:56:35.820
We're not looking that up.
And Jesus fucking Christ.

2076
01:56:35.850 --> 01:56:39.060
How do you suddenly get the guys that have about one thing?
I don't know the guy,

2077
01:56:39.061 --> 01:56:41.280
you don't know him.
You don't know his scenario.

2078
01:56:41.281 --> 01:56:46.230
You have never talked to anyone about it.
It's surprising.
It looks odd,

2079
01:56:46.380 --> 01:56:50.340
but you may not know whether it be a transgender,

2080
01:56:50.400 --> 01:56:53.490
his skin is very tight and he might,
he might very well,

2081
01:56:53.491 --> 01:56:58.491
I find it peculiar that you would spend any time what so ever contemplating

2082
01:57:00.570 --> 01:57:01.670
storing this,

2083
01:57:03.890 --> 01:57:08.890
finding your friends names so that we can get this out while being as vague as

2084
01:57:09.241 --> 01:57:09.960
possible.

2085
01:57:09.960 --> 01:57:14.960
I'm very vague and to maybe is it would explain how he's able to hang out with

2086
01:57:15.311 --> 01:57:19.400
those squawking hands all day.
Only one would tell it.

2087
01:57:19.410 --> 01:57:22.200
Talk about the chicken heads.
He's the only one with talent.

2088
01:57:22.630 --> 01:57:27.020
I don't have all those bitches in that house.
He just needs to look around,

2089
01:57:27.030 --> 01:57:29.760
be like,
ah no,

2090
01:57:29.930 --> 01:57:32.760
we're the only reasonable he bitches or here's cause I have talent.

2091
01:57:33.030 --> 01:57:35.420
Can we acknowledge that's not true.
The reason why they're there is to,

2092
01:57:35.430 --> 01:57:40.330
she did porn and she was friends with Paris Hilton and her mom was the architect

2093
01:57:40.331 --> 01:57:41.640
of a lot of it.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2094
01:57:41.641 --> 01:57:44.820
And there her mom was married to Robert Kardashian who was a famous lawyer.

2095
01:57:45.210 --> 01:57:49.350
There's a lot involved there.
Oj Chicken head excuses though.

2096
01:57:49.380 --> 01:57:53.670
But he was already like long past his fame.
Yes.

2097
01:57:53.700 --> 01:57:56.370
When he came back with this,
I mean there was no one who,

2098
01:57:56.490 --> 01:57:59.670
no one was hanging out talking about how great Bruce Jenner was.

2099
01:57:59.671 --> 01:58:02.770
It just never came out and get into movies after,
after the Olympics.
So he got,

2100
01:58:02.850 --> 01:58:06.710
he did this,
you got to know this job and did you get a nose job is no,

2101
01:58:06.711 --> 01:58:09.420
this is very,
very different than it used to be.
Very different.
And um,

2102
01:58:10.710 --> 01:58:14.340
and it didn't work out.
It didn't work out.
And,
uh,
and then,
I don't know,

2103
01:58:14.940 --> 01:58:18.830
you're going to keep trying to put it in anyway.
I mean,

2104
01:58:18.840 --> 01:58:22.590
I think the,
I think what the Kardashians have done,

2105
01:58:22.591 --> 01:58:27.330
I think the mom is a genius marketing genius.
Well those girls,

2106
01:58:27.331 --> 01:58:28.470
and run with it like this.
Then the,

2107
01:58:28.480 --> 01:58:31.600
see Ryan Seacrest's got behind them and then Bam,
they're like,

2108
01:58:31.710 --> 01:58:35.510
now every girl wants to be them.
That's not good for a girl.
It's only dummies.

2109
01:58:35.910 --> 01:58:36.780
It's only dummies in,

2110
01:58:36.781 --> 01:58:39.360
they're young and they don't know any better cause it looks glamorous and she's

2111
01:58:39.361 --> 01:58:41.830
got all the nice stuff that everybody wants.
It's hard to get,

2112
01:58:41.831 --> 01:58:45.820
but it doesn't mean that it's,
it's,
it's kind of like the porn star thing where,

2113
01:58:45.821 --> 01:58:48.970
where,
um,
it's not tied to accomplishment.
The,

2114
01:58:48.980 --> 01:58:52.670
it's the wrong kind of in an attention.
You can make that argument.
Well,

2115
01:58:52.671 --> 01:58:53.620
he's a porn star.

2116
01:58:53.621 --> 01:58:57.810
Could just like show awesome Dick Sucking technique where you just want to jump

2117
01:58:57.811 --> 01:59:02.440
off to.
Yeah,
yeah.
Well it's about Kara.
Kara was like,
let's be honest,

2118
01:59:02.470 --> 01:59:07.000
it's not really a talent.
She goes,
it's not really a skillset.
It's not a skill.

2119
01:59:07.180 --> 01:59:09.520
You're kind of born fucking,
she goes,
I was always fucking,

2120
01:59:09.820 --> 01:59:13.630
and she was always very sexual and now she does not on camera,
you know?
Yeah.

2121
01:59:13.631 --> 01:59:15.970
But some girls are bad at it.
So it is a talent.

2122
01:59:16.790 --> 01:59:20.620
It's a talent or is it a skill?
Like if I,
if I played golf,

2123
01:59:20.650 --> 01:59:22.970
every dad be pretty damn good.
If I was,

2124
01:59:23.380 --> 01:59:27.310
if I was a girl jacking guys off so I can dig out and get pretty good.
Okay,

2125
01:59:27.311 --> 01:59:29.980
let's,
let's Google,
what's the difference between talent and skill?

2126
01:59:29.981 --> 01:59:34.080
Because I'm not entirely sure.
Well,
town will,
you were born God deal.

2127
01:59:34.090 --> 01:59:36.970
You can work at scale is something that you work at getting better at.

2128
01:59:37.180 --> 01:59:41.950
Now I'm not buying that because some people have no talent in the beginning and

2129
01:59:41.951 --> 01:59:45.400
then they work at it and then people go,
wow,
that's a skill and talent.

2130
01:59:46.060 --> 01:59:48.970
Sometimes you see somebody who's,
who's getting a ring in their boxer and you go,

2131
01:59:48.971 --> 01:59:50.620
you got talent,
you could actually be good.

2132
01:59:50.680 --> 01:59:52.900
Whereas you see somebody who doesn't have town and you go,

2133
01:59:52.901 --> 01:59:53.351
you're gonna have to go.

2134
01:59:53.351 --> 01:59:56.320
You're going to have to work really hard and develop skill to make up for your

2135
01:59:56.321 --> 01:59:57.550
talent.
Here's how it's described.

2136
01:59:57.551 --> 02:00:01.840
Online talent is usually an innate ability to do something.

2137
02:00:02.320 --> 02:00:05.600
While skill is a learned ability to do something that's weird.

2138
02:00:05.660 --> 02:00:10.570
Talent is the natural aspect that needs a little nudge to realize while skill

2139
02:00:10.571 --> 02:00:14.350
requires investment of a lot of time talent,

2140
02:00:14.351 --> 02:00:17.470
and then the really scary thing is when talented people develop skills,

2141
02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:22.540
that's when you get a Jon Jones,
Mike Tyson.
Yeah,
that's the difference.

2142
02:00:22.570 --> 02:00:27.100
Or these porn stars you're talking about that or girl who just can take tongue

2143
02:00:27.101 --> 02:00:31.420
to the ball.
Just la La.
Why?

2144
02:00:31.421 --> 02:00:33.280
How has she been able to do that without throwing up?

2145
02:00:33.281 --> 02:00:37.860
How is she doing a lot of skill involved?
Lot of expense skill.
A lot of reading.

2146
02:00:37.980 --> 02:00:38.310
Well,

2147
02:00:38.310 --> 02:00:43.310
also as somebody who has such a huge fan base because you believe her face,

2148
02:00:43.451 --> 02:00:46.090
like she,
I was talking to about that,
her acting,

2149
02:00:46.091 --> 02:00:50.440
her ability to make you think she's really enjoying it is Brian thinks this

2150
02:00:50.450 --> 02:00:51.310
girl's a legit,

2151
02:00:51.311 --> 02:00:55.660
like I finished talking to her for an hour and that's what we were talking
about.

2152
02:00:55.720 --> 02:01:00.700
So she's a freak.
Yeah.
Yeah.
This is,
people are not,
they shouldn't be porn stars.

2153
02:01:00.760 --> 02:01:04.350
And then there's people that go,
oh yeah.
Well you're good at it.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2154
02:01:05.480 --> 02:01:08.260
You're good at it.
But she,
yeah,
she does some hardcore stuff too.

2155
02:01:08.870 --> 02:01:12.450
I'm not familiar with it.
It's not light.
I wasn't either.
She doesn't matter.

2156
02:01:12.500 --> 02:01:16.810
Easy Shola podcasts.
Oh really?
The one we were at really?

2157
02:01:17.240 --> 02:01:20.470
She had this book and I read it and I said,
come on,
read her whole book.
Yeah.

2158
02:01:20.490 --> 02:01:24.520
It's really easy.
It's funny actually.
It's like short.
No,
but she's so honest.

2159
02:01:24.521 --> 02:01:27.220
Could we,
oh my God.
Is she honest about it?
Did you read it naked?

2160
02:01:27.221 --> 02:01:31.520
I did read it naked in horse stance.
It a

2161
02:01:33.460 --> 02:01:38.220
bestseller book just came out.
Can you just came out?
Huh?
I Dunno.
You know,

2162
02:01:38.250 --> 02:01:42.650
they say now Kreischer was saying that the book selling business so fucked and

2163
02:01:42.651 --> 02:01:46.910
so bad that unless there's preorders like,
like they,

2164
02:01:46.911 --> 02:01:48.800
the amount of books that they put out,

2165
02:01:48.801 --> 02:01:52.310
unless there's a ton of preorders they barely bought wound up putting them on

2166
02:01:52.311 --> 02:01:55.530
shelves or bringing them to bookstores and things along those lines because

2167
02:01:55.531 --> 02:01:57.440
people,
it's really hard.
I'm kindle and all that.

2168
02:01:57.950 --> 02:02:00.590
They're getting from that and it just not buying that many books,
man.
Peter,

2169
02:02:00.640 --> 02:02:04.130
we're just not buying that many fucking books.
That's how it gets signed.
Yeah.

2170
02:02:04.550 --> 02:02:06.620
I'm going to let everybody know that Ustream crashed.

2171
02:02:06.740 --> 02:02:09.870
You're having a real bad problem with this computer right now.
Bandwidth.

2172
02:02:11.040 --> 02:02:14.690
Audio's still going good.
So okay.
I'm just let everybody,
Ustream is shit the bed.

2173
02:02:17.450 --> 02:02:21.280
We'll be back soon.
We'll be actually soon.
If possible.
We'll be back soon.

2174
02:02:23.040 --> 02:02:23.490
<v 0>Okay.</v>

2175
02:02:23.490 --> 02:02:24.900
<v 4>So,
uh,
do you guys,</v>

2176
02:02:26.130 --> 02:02:29.970
do you guys plan on doing anything with the fighter and the kid we take it to

2177
02:02:29.971 --> 02:02:32.780
like,
or a network or take it to somewhere else?
Well,

2178
02:02:33.660 --> 02:02:36.990
we just got the numbers back and they're good,
right?
They're good.

2179
02:02:36.991 --> 02:02:39.720
So it's time to start making some moves.
Yeah.

2180
02:02:39.721 --> 02:02:42.270
You got to do something where you could swear.
I'm just gonna tell you right now,

2181
02:02:42.300 --> 02:02:45.030
every time we get together and we do a podcast,
I'm going to tell you,

2182
02:02:45.060 --> 02:02:48.450
you got to stop doing this nonsense where they tell you what you can and can't

2183
02:02:48.451 --> 02:02:52.080
say.
You got to stop.
You Go,
you go.
You're,
you're dirty comedian.

2184
02:02:52.081 --> 02:02:55.500
You're a cage fighter,
so you can't,
you can't censor that.

2185
02:02:55.950 --> 02:02:58.770
What kind of nonsense is this?
This is ridiculous.
We agree.

2186
02:02:59.720 --> 02:03:00.830
It's an argument that comedian,

2187
02:03:00.850 --> 02:03:05.400
a fucking cage fighter and telling me what pocket put on the air that the last

2188
02:03:05.401 --> 02:03:08.140
podcast,
we did talk about broken decks yesterday.
Yeah.

2189
02:03:08.160 --> 02:03:11.260
No broken desc stories on the,
I know Brooke can dig stories.

2190
02:03:12.550 --> 02:03:15.120
My friend texts me,
he goes,
you son of a pastor.

2191
02:03:15.260 --> 02:03:17.700
You told us that no one knows it's you.

2192
02:03:18.090 --> 02:03:21.150
Everyone knew it was all our friends and family knew.

2193
02:03:21.151 --> 02:03:23.910
It was one of the greatest broken dick stories of all time.
Damn right.

2194
02:03:23.970 --> 02:03:26.040
Everybody knows somebody who knows somebody broke the deck.

2195
02:03:26.550 --> 02:03:28.110
It's one of those things.
It's well as things.

2196
02:03:28.111 --> 02:03:30.760
You don't want to be that guy though.
Fuck.
You live in in Scotland.

2197
02:03:30.770 --> 02:03:34.860
You know somebody who knows somebody who's seen the loch ness monster.
Yeah.

2198
02:03:34.861 --> 02:03:38.490
There's not a,
this is not a bad broken Dick's story out there.
By the way.

2199
02:03:38.760 --> 02:03:43.230
Every broker,
all story makes you go,
oh no,
no.

2200
02:03:43.740 --> 02:03:46.830
It's usually an aggressive grows on top was just really crazy.

2201
02:03:47.270 --> 02:03:52.110
You would think the guy would like that.
Straight Elephant Dick.
I'll see.

2202
02:03:52.170 --> 02:03:55.380
It's long and if you think it's going to break in the middle like a twig,

2203
02:03:55.590 --> 02:03:56.340
it's not good.

2204
02:03:56.340 --> 02:04:00.510
You a short stubby Dick would be way harder to break in the middle of say for if

2205
02:04:00.511 --> 02:04:04.080
you're going to be promiscuous like shorts,
you have a long piece of metal,

2206
02:04:04.470 --> 02:04:07.770
you can bend it.
Exactly.

2207
02:04:07.771 --> 02:04:10.740
If you have something you want a short stubby,

2208
02:04:10.770 --> 02:04:13.260
you try bending the lighter sized piece of metal.

2209
02:04:13.520 --> 02:04:18.520
It's hard to dance very hard working with like a monster Ding Dong here.

2210
02:04:18.990 --> 02:04:20.790
You know what I'm saying?
It doesn't have to be monster.

2211
02:04:20.940 --> 02:04:25.050
All it has to do is just hit that taint at the right angle.
Bang,

2212
02:04:25.051 --> 02:04:28.890
like a fucking Ferrari that hits one of those jersey barriers.

2213
02:04:30.830 --> 02:04:34.640
Ben's the frame.
Ah,
AH,
ugh.

2214
02:04:34.770 --> 02:04:38.280
Fucking bloods pooling up and your ball neither.

2215
02:04:38.280 --> 02:04:41.880
<v 1>You guys ever broke your Dick?
Not even close.
My Dick is bulletproof by the way.</v>

2216
02:04:43.230 --> 02:04:45.600
It's not going to break.
I have not.
I've not.

2217
02:04:45.630 --> 02:04:50.580
I was always careful about that stuff.
I don't always hold up watching.

2218
02:04:50.581 --> 02:04:55.050
Everybody calmed down
and then I did.
It grows a bite.

2219
02:04:55.230 --> 02:05:00.060
Your face,
your lips and I'm like,
hey,
that really hurts and makes me angry.

2220
02:05:00.090 --> 02:05:01.830
Not attractive role.
I have a girlfriend.

2221
02:05:01.831 --> 02:05:06.030
When I first started fighting for whatever reason,
she started hitting me.

2222
02:05:06.090 --> 02:05:10.770
Oh my God.
Like abusive.
But like we say something like,
well that's stupid.

2223
02:05:10.771 --> 02:05:14.790
She be like,
Babe,
like that's fucking hitting.
Where was she hitting you?

2224
02:05:14.791 --> 02:05:18.030
What part of your body?
She'd hit me in the chest.
Ship me in the arm.

2225
02:05:18.060 --> 02:05:20.190
Not In the face.
That gets weird.

2226
02:05:20.191 --> 02:05:23.850
That'd been chicken head hit me in the face of your chicken to chicken out if

2227
02:05:23.851 --> 02:05:26.100
she hits you.
Yes.
A little bit.
Chicken,

2228
02:05:27.420 --> 02:05:30.900
chicken had characteristics.
You should.
You have a chicken head tee shirt,
dude,

2229
02:05:30.901 --> 02:05:35.700
you should sell a to it.
He Shit.
Chicken heads fighter.
A fighter in the kid

2230
02:05:38.270 --> 02:05:41.310
or just have a chicken that a voice like a chicken head Trevor chicken head at

2231
02:05:41.311 --> 02:05:45.840
all costs.
Avoid at all costs.
Yeah,
and just just a chicken head.

2232
02:05:46.110 --> 02:05:48.870
Don't have a severed chicken head though.
Cause now that's two and two.

2233
02:05:49.500 --> 02:05:52.180
I don't want that.
It's sort of like it fades off like no one.

2234
02:05:52.470 --> 02:05:55.230
Just draw the chicken head and that's it.
You know what I mean?
Anything else?

2235
02:05:55.380 --> 02:05:57.750
She was the head bottom was like,
no,
no.

2236
02:05:57.751 --> 02:06:01.770
You could do a chicken head and then just as Bob Banging this body in a bikini,

2237
02:06:03.540 --> 02:06:08.300
that's good.
The fighter and the kid shop.com that's the answer.

2238
02:06:08.870 --> 02:06:13.080
[inaudible] heads at all costs.
Yeah.
That's a great idea.
Boy,

2239
02:06:13.081 --> 02:06:18.081
that might be the most sexist shirt has ever sexist.

2240
02:06:18.900 --> 02:06:21.220
Knowing women are going to be angry at that.
Well

2241
02:06:22.950 --> 02:06:25.800
it doesn't matter.
Women will do something that men won't do,

2242
02:06:26.040 --> 02:06:30.990
whereas they'll gang up and go after a guy who shitting on any type of woman.

2243
02:06:31.050 --> 02:06:32.940
True.
Whereas men,
if you,

2244
02:06:32.941 --> 02:06:36.780
if there's a group of women that are making fun of a man,
like,
or a type of man,

2245
02:06:36.781 --> 02:06:41.660
we don't give a fuck.
[inaudible]
actually stay really quiet.

2246
02:06:41.690 --> 02:06:44.040
Oh,
sorry about that.
Then we won't attack.

2247
02:06:45.570 --> 02:06:46.950
When Sharon Osborne,
you know,

2248
02:06:46.951 --> 02:06:50.460
she has that showed the talk and they were talking about a guy who got his dick

2249
02:06:50.461 --> 02:06:53.340
cut off and the girl through the Dick in the garbage disposal and they were

2250
02:06:53.341 --> 02:06:54.270
laughing about it.

2251
02:06:54.480 --> 02:06:57.910
She was laughing about his Willie spinning around in the garbage disposal.

2252
02:06:57.960 --> 02:06:58.793
That's the funding.

2253
02:06:59.070 --> 02:07:03.600
I imagine if there was a show where a guy was laughing because he heard a story

2254
02:07:03.601 --> 02:07:07.750
about a woman getting her vagina cutoff and the guy throwing it in a garbage

2255
02:07:08.450 --> 02:07:12.540
should be canceled.
It would be a fucking right.
If Dr Phil did that,

2256
02:07:12.640 --> 02:07:17.430
she'll be canceled.
Yeah,
I,
I,
it would be a pariah forever.

2257
02:07:18.110 --> 02:07:21.450
She's suffered no repercussions for it.
That is different thing.
Well,

2258
02:07:21.451 --> 02:07:25.530
it's not our Dick.
It's not a dick.
We don't care.
But if it's a woman,
you know,

2259
02:07:25.531 --> 02:07:29.850
and I get it because it's more likely that a man is going to assault a woman

2260
02:07:29.851 --> 02:07:31.080
than a woman's going to salt the man.

2261
02:07:31.081 --> 02:07:36.081
But you can't laugh when a woman in salts assaults a man and expect people

2262
02:07:36.220 --> 02:07:39.420
<v 4>to be just peace,
love,
and nirvana throughout the sexes,
the genders.</v>

2263
02:07:40.110 --> 02:07:43.510
That's a man hating shit,
man.

2264
02:07:43.890 --> 02:07:48.760
And An InSinkErator.
I mean,
it's dark as dark.
Damn.

2265
02:07:48.761 --> 02:07:52.840
That's a nasty fight.
What happened was the guy that she drugged him,
she drugged,

2266
02:07:53.740 --> 02:07:56.320
she put him to sleep and she cut his dick off.

2267
02:07:56.321 --> 02:07:59.920
Then she threw the garbage disposal.
She might be clippers,
chicken cheating.

2268
02:08:00.550 --> 02:08:03.960
I don't know.
I think he was leaving her.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't,

2269
02:08:03.970 --> 02:08:08.200
oh my God.
But that show,
whatever it was,
she,

2270
02:08:08.201 --> 02:08:11.680
she's Sharon Osborne laughing about his Dick Spinning around in a circle.

2271
02:08:11.830 --> 02:08:16.660
She could,
I could just see as willy spouse.
Sharon Osborne was in Vegas.

2272
02:08:16.661 --> 02:08:19.390
I was looking,
I was looking for some shoes and she got the guy who cooks.

2273
02:08:19.540 --> 02:08:23.800
Can I see some id?
I was right there and she goes,
go fuck herself.
And her,

2274
02:08:23.920 --> 02:08:27.880
the guy she was with,
she walked out.
He goes,
what happened?
And she goes,

2275
02:08:27.940 --> 02:08:30.550
she asked me Friday.
I didn't know I was,
I told him to go fuck himself.

2276
02:08:30.730 --> 02:08:34.510
I heard that with my own.
I don't gossip and I and I,
when I saw that I went,

2277
02:08:34.511 --> 02:08:38.410
that's an asshole move.
That's a Shitty,
that's shit.
That's not cool.

2278
02:08:38.440 --> 02:08:40.610
That's a big time.
That was rude.
Relax.

2279
02:08:42.110 --> 02:08:43.900
That's a pair of lavender and I saw,

2280
02:08:43.901 --> 02:08:47.050
I heard anyone in this world is famous enough to do that.
That's not cool.

2281
02:08:47.060 --> 02:08:49.820
Then what is she famous for?
Exactly.
It'd be an,
I don't know.

2282
02:08:49.821 --> 02:08:53.320
I ain't know it was her at first.
Then I was like,
reality shows legit on MTV.

2283
02:08:53.321 --> 02:08:57.940
I love,
she's married to Ozzy Osborne who was totally out of it.
Yeah,

2284
02:08:58.210 --> 02:09:01.480
I mean literally dragged up the whole time.
Shit.
Right.

2285
02:09:01.481 --> 02:09:04.820
Shaking all over the place.
Shit in his pants.
You want,
she's killed.

2286
02:09:04.930 --> 02:09:09.370
She's totally on the ball.
She's on the ball and he's off the ball.
True.

2287
02:09:09.371 --> 02:09:13.660
She was having a bad day.
She has those extra hungry eyes.
Super Thirsty for Dick.

2288
02:09:13.690 --> 02:09:16.560
That's what it looked like.
Is that what you got out of it?
That's what

2289
02:09:18.330 --> 02:09:23.110
I don't know what she does.
I have no idea.
She's doing well though.
Well,

2290
02:09:23.111 --> 02:09:25.210
she made a lot of money with Ozzie.
Sure.

2291
02:09:25.240 --> 02:09:29.140
I just think that's a bummer when people treat others.
It is a bond,
man.

2292
02:09:29.141 --> 02:09:32.500
A thumb me out.
Yep.
I even said to the guy goes,
is that the,

2293
02:09:32.501 --> 02:09:35.620
did she do what I thought?
And they had the guy who worked at that store.

2294
02:09:35.621 --> 02:09:38.680
Was that w.
W what point do you get like that though?

2295
02:09:39.010 --> 02:09:42.970
When things are going to face is having a bad day?

2296
02:09:43.900 --> 02:09:47.590
Have you ever pulled the famous card?
Never.
Never.
Joe's never liked that.

2297
02:09:47.920 --> 02:09:49.990
I'm not that guy.
I think that most famous,

2298
02:09:49.991 --> 02:09:52.890
completely legitimate and just random and lucky.
I'm,

2299
02:09:52.900 --> 02:09:56.590
I'm much more impressed with talented people that people don't know.

2300
02:09:56.980 --> 02:10:00.340
Then I usually am with talented people that are really famous.
You know?

2301
02:10:00.341 --> 02:10:02.770
I think talent is what impresses me.
You know?

2302
02:10:02.780 --> 02:10:06.520
If someone happens to be famous and talented,
that's more like,
wow,

2303
02:10:06.521 --> 02:10:08.200
that's interesting.
Let's see how this guy manages it,

2304
02:10:08.201 --> 02:10:10.620
but I don't look at him like they're better anyway.

2305
02:10:11.090 --> 02:10:13.150
Anybody thinks that just because you're famous,

2306
02:10:13.390 --> 02:10:15.790
you're a better person or someone should know you.

2307
02:10:15.820 --> 02:10:20.230
People ask me my name all the time when I know they know my name and I always

2308
02:10:20.231 --> 02:10:23.350
assume that it's either because they're not sure.

2309
02:10:23.410 --> 02:10:26.110
You know that maybe they don't know MMA that well and they think I'm Dana White.

2310
02:10:26.160 --> 02:10:29.590
Like I've had people call me Dana white cause they know there's some sort of a

2311
02:10:29.591 --> 02:10:32.430
weird connection and UFC like they ran,

2312
02:10:32.470 --> 02:10:36.130
they barely watch it and I'll make that mistake.
Or you're wearing a suit too.

2313
02:10:36.420 --> 02:10:38.180
I was saying that sometimes you got to be careful like,

2314
02:10:38.181 --> 02:10:40.100
like I don't know what happened was Sean Osmo,

2315
02:10:40.130 --> 02:10:44.010
maybe she was in a having a terrible day or something like that.
Make,
excuse me,

2316
02:10:45.280 --> 02:10:46.113
watching everything.

2317
02:10:46.880 --> 02:10:49.970
They watch everything you do and some days you can just do something you regret.

2318
02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:54.380
You know I fucked up in a,
he could have been that the guy was being a dick too.

2319
02:10:54.381 --> 02:10:57.500
It could have been the guy was doing a power move knows and she knew what the

2320
02:10:57.501 --> 02:11:02.450
fuck was going on.
I had this lady totally pull a power move on me once.

2321
02:11:02.570 --> 02:11:06.260
She was one of the security people at an arena and a,

2322
02:11:06.261 --> 02:11:08.160
I was running in and I had my,
uh,

2323
02:11:08.210 --> 02:11:13.210
my UFC tag on and she like stopped me and wanted to see id as well as in like

2324
02:11:14.151 --> 02:11:15.170
all these other things that,

2325
02:11:15.350 --> 02:11:18.170
and everybody around her was working with and starts laughing,
you know,

2326
02:11:18.171 --> 02:11:20.690
like bitch,
you know who that is?
Like the guy who was working with her,
it goes,

2327
02:11:20.691 --> 02:11:23.680
you know who that is?
Like let them through.
And she's like,
ah,
you know,

2328
02:11:23.690 --> 02:11:26.870
I need to see this now.
But it was weird.

2329
02:11:26.871 --> 02:11:29.480
It was like she just decided and she was just like really aggressive.

2330
02:11:30.030 --> 02:11:30.863
It's her moment

2331
02:11:31.270 --> 02:11:35.920
<v 3>sometimes I'm not famous,
right.
I'm not that famous at all,</v>

2332
02:11:35.950 --> 02:11:38.140
but sometimes can work against you.
Like I went to,

2333
02:11:38.141 --> 02:11:39.610
you guys can clown me all you want.

2334
02:11:39.611 --> 02:11:43.970
And I told Brian and I went to go buy a Prius on Saturday,
right.

2335
02:11:43.980 --> 02:11:46.180
To do that because I drive 600 miles.

2336
02:11:46.181 --> 02:11:48.880
I average 600 miles a week in training camp.

2337
02:11:49.180 --> 02:11:52.990
So I bought a Prius just for the 50 miles a gallon.
I still have my m six.

2338
02:11:52.991 --> 02:11:56.420
Don't get it twisted.
It's got them sick and drives that Prius.
I can,
I'm saying,

2339
02:11:56.490 --> 02:11:59.110
yeah,
I do.
I drive the shit thing.
The wheels are gonna fall off any second,

2340
02:11:59.140 --> 02:12:02.750
however that Prius,
right.
50 miles a gallon.
So when I go the deal,

2341
02:12:02.770 --> 02:12:05.320
I'm taking pictures with the dealers,
stuff like that.

2342
02:12:06.250 --> 02:12:10.300
Well they think because you're on TV,
you're this instant mega millionaire.
Right.

2343
02:12:10.450 --> 02:12:12.850
And I,
I brought my coach with me.
I told him,
I was like,

2344
02:12:13.180 --> 02:12:17.020
either because they know who I am looking at hooked me up or they're going to be

2345
02:12:17.021 --> 02:12:21.640
like,
no,
this guy is bawling.
Just fucking rob rob them.
So when they come up,

2346
02:12:21.641 --> 02:12:25.630
I'm like,
oh cool man.
Uh,
you let sit down.
I obviously want to fucking Prius.

2347
02:12:25.840 --> 02:12:28.990
So we're sitting there,
they come back some ridiculous number.

2348
02:12:28.991 --> 02:12:33.190
It totally backfired,
man.
But eventually,
you know what hustled and got him down.

2349
02:12:33.310 --> 02:12:37.240
But in general it backfires.
I feel like because the people think,
oh,

2350
02:12:37.330 --> 02:12:39.760
this guy doesn't care.
He has all this money.
He doesn't care what,
what,

2351
02:12:39.761 --> 02:12:42.700
what number?
Whatever number we bring him,
he's going to pay for it.

2352
02:12:43.450 --> 02:12:47.290
<v 4>Wow.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That definitely can happen.
They can definitely target you.</v>

2353
02:12:47.500 --> 02:12:48.760
They feel like you're a score.

2354
02:12:49.270 --> 02:12:52.210
That's just someone who's an idiot who doesn't understand personal relations,

2355
02:12:52.240 --> 02:12:54.580
don't you?
Don't you know,
you,
you ruined the city.

2356
02:12:54.581 --> 02:12:57.340
Like you don't think the guy knows that you are,
you're doing that.
I've had,

2357
02:12:57.400 --> 02:13:00.640
I had a guy tried to sell me a car for $10,000 more than it was advertised on

2358
02:13:00.641 --> 02:13:02.230
the Internet.
Really?
Yeah.

2359
02:13:02.290 --> 02:13:05.920
Like I went to a deal and I was asking him about cars while back and uh,

2360
02:13:05.921 --> 02:13:08.980
and I go,
I'm like,
what do you,
what do you guys sell in this for?

2361
02:13:08.981 --> 02:13:13.981
I asked when I knew the answer and d homeboy hit me with a $10,000 over the

2362
02:13:14.290 --> 02:13:17.010
figure online and I go,
you sure?
And he goes,
yeah,

2363
02:13:17.160 --> 02:13:20.110
well how come it says different online?
And then he goes ghost pale.

2364
02:13:21.040 --> 02:13:22.680
Cause he was a fucking asshole.
He was a,

2365
02:13:22.750 --> 02:13:26.890
he was a guy who was hoping that I didn't pay attention and he could just knock

2366
02:13:26.891 --> 02:13:29.770
another 10,000.
Dot.
Hey,
I got it for 10,000 over the price,

2367
02:13:29.771 --> 02:13:33.080
pull it off the Internet quick.
Yeah.
All that,
that type of thing.

2368
02:13:33.160 --> 02:13:36.720
In terms of short term phase two,
that's what I took it as.
To me it was like,

2369
02:13:36.721 --> 02:13:40.780
dude,
come on man.
Idiot man.
I mean,
come on.
No,

2370
02:13:41.350 --> 02:13:45.870
an honest mistake for 100% when you confront someone famous,

2371
02:13:46.130 --> 02:13:50.040
<v 5>Donald's a philosophy where you walk into the room and uh,</v>

2372
02:13:50.120 --> 02:13:54.470
when did their store and you're considered worth $54,000.
What does that mean?

2373
02:13:54.950 --> 02:13:59.420
The average person who is a Mcdonald's customer,
I don't know if this 20 more,

2374
02:13:59.430 --> 02:14:02.990
it would spend over a lifetime about $54,000.
So when you walk in,

2375
02:14:02.991 --> 02:14:06.080
you wouldn't Mcdonald's,
yes,
you are not a meal.
So is that like in their book?

2376
02:14:06.430 --> 02:14:09.980
So you're not a meal.
What you are is your worth not that hamburger.

2377
02:14:10.400 --> 02:14:14.570
You are worth $54,000 over our lifetime and it's called longterm thinking.
Right.

2378
02:14:14.720 --> 02:14:17.840
So a lot of companies will talk about that like Dell,
Dell assess what the,

2379
02:14:17.841 --> 02:14:22.370
what the repeat customers worth over a lifetime and it's a big number and that's

2380
02:14:22.371 --> 02:14:25.490
the way to run a business.
And when you start thinking short term,
greedy and go,

2381
02:14:25.500 --> 02:14:28.700
I can get this guy for you know,
$1,000 extra.
You're being stupid.

2382
02:14:28.730 --> 02:14:31.880
<v 4>That is a good idea.
But the best idea is to take it one step further.</v>

2383
02:14:31.881 --> 02:14:36.881
Not just fucking be nice to be born [inaudible] $54,000 bill.

2384
02:14:39.200 --> 02:14:40.490
You don't have to think of it like that.

2385
02:14:40.491 --> 02:14:44.540
Just be nice to people and try to put out a good sort of vibe,

2386
02:14:44.770 --> 02:14:48.800
play tool call doing the right thing and fire people that act like dicks but the

2387
02:14:48.801 --> 02:14:51.830
managers at Dick,
get rid of them.
Tell everybody that works there.
Listen,

2388
02:14:52.210 --> 02:14:54.530
I'm looking to hire nice,
friendly people.

2389
02:14:54.650 --> 02:14:57.470
I want an environment that's positive for everybody to work in.

2390
02:14:57.560 --> 02:15:00.140
Everybody's having a good time.
It's not good enough.
Just be good at your job.

2391
02:15:00.350 --> 02:15:02.780
You have to also be a nice person.
If you're not a nice person,

2392
02:15:02.781 --> 02:15:04.040
I'm really not interested in working with you.

2393
02:15:04.041 --> 02:15:07.940
Are you a nice person and if they liked s I'm going to go to windows and they

2394
02:15:07.941 --> 02:15:10.890
just fucking mumble and leave.
You know what though?

2395
02:15:10.900 --> 02:15:15.350
Some people act out of fear and if you explain to them the philosophy behind why

2396
02:15:15.351 --> 02:15:16.700
to be ethical in that sense,

2397
02:15:16.701 --> 02:15:20.450
sometimes it can help them cause I just have set goals,
friendly,
being nice.

2398
02:15:20.480 --> 02:15:23.590
You know,
being nice should be mandatory.
Yes.
That's,

2399
02:15:23.600 --> 02:15:26.810
I mean it's pretty common sense.
Don't be an asshole.
Well it's also,

2400
02:15:26.960 --> 02:15:27.793
it's not though.
You know,

2401
02:15:28.250 --> 02:15:31.070
it should be well be everybody's in competition with everybody else.

2402
02:15:31.100 --> 02:15:35.480
And it's like there's certain people that at a certain point in time it's like

2403
02:15:35.750 --> 02:15:39.680
when we're talking about the guy in the gym that's mad dog in you,
you know,

2404
02:15:39.681 --> 02:15:42.710
because you did it girl,
he's a bitch.
You know?
So when you,

2405
02:15:42.711 --> 02:15:47.570
when you run into certain guys that are weak in character,
their own insecurity,

2406
02:15:47.760 --> 02:15:51.170
we allow that word stuff in,
in acting stuff too.

2407
02:15:51.171 --> 02:15:54.230
Like real people.
Yeah.
Where people will get really,

2408
02:15:54.231 --> 02:15:57.640
really bummed out because somebody else got successful and they get all right.

2409
02:15:57.750 --> 02:16:00.990
<v 5>Worried or mean about it and realize like,
why are you focusing on that?</v>

2410
02:16:00.991 --> 02:16:01.440
Why the fuck

2411
02:16:01.440 --> 02:16:04.860
<v 4>he's cause good somebody else's and just focus on your own thing.</v>

2412
02:16:04.861 --> 02:16:07.130
Why are you focusing on somebody else?
So they don't know.
Well,

2413
02:16:07.230 --> 02:16:09.620
they don't know how to think and they've got a pattern there.

2414
02:16:09.630 --> 02:16:10.830
The stuck in a bad pattern.

2415
02:16:10.831 --> 02:16:15.300
I had a girl speaking of just not being nice out of girl who people warned me

2416
02:16:15.301 --> 02:16:18.550
about or like listen to it.
She's not that cool.
It's kind of a bitch.

2417
02:16:18.551 --> 02:16:20.700
And I was like,
I don't see it super friendly to me.

2418
02:16:21.090 --> 02:16:24.330
We go this Thai restaurant straight,
you know,

2419
02:16:24.510 --> 02:16:27.840
traditional Thai restaurant and the lady taking the order didn't speak very good

2420
02:16:27.841 --> 02:16:32.720
English and the my date while she's trying or this stuff,
the lady was like,
uh,

2421
02:16:33.030 --> 02:16:36.940
uh,
say it again,
right?
Like in whatever broken English and this,

2422
02:16:36.970 --> 02:16:41.660
my date starts laughing at her,
making fun of her.
I was like,
what?
No,
no,
no,

2423
02:16:41.680 --> 02:16:45.640
never saw her gas finish that meal.
She's like,
so we going to the movie,
not,

2424
02:16:45.680 --> 02:16:49.440
I'll feel good.
It just bounce again.
What's that growth?
What's it going wrote?

2425
02:16:49.450 --> 02:16:52.900
That book has said,
look,
make sure you advice to women.

2426
02:16:53.410 --> 02:16:56.440
Pay attention to how the man you're with treats.

2427
02:16:56.500 --> 02:17:00.420
The waiter because that treats you well girls.

2428
02:17:00.530 --> 02:17:04.240
Two girls.
Two people would treat people badly when they don't have to.

2429
02:17:04.241 --> 02:17:07.270
When it's an opportunity to be nice to people,
right?
People tip badly.

2430
02:17:07.600 --> 02:17:12.190
If I see someone tipping badly,
I lose massive respect for them.

2431
02:17:12.191 --> 02:17:13.360
Especially someone with money.

2432
02:17:13.670 --> 02:17:16.360
I see a guy with money who's doing well for himself,

2433
02:17:16.390 --> 02:17:19.710
who is really cheap with the tip or takes money back,
puts my down,

2434
02:17:19.720 --> 02:17:24.270
thinks about and then take some back.
Oh it's dark.
That's dark,
dark,

2435
02:17:24.271 --> 02:17:26.980
just dark.
Cause this is like everything you don't want to see in a person.

2436
02:17:27.040 --> 02:17:30.250
Selfish,
short minded,
shithead like you're doing well does.

2437
02:17:30.251 --> 02:17:32.380
You don't have money concern right now.
You don't have money concern.

2438
02:17:32.381 --> 02:17:35.060
You have an opportunity to be nice to somebody is giving you a good worker.

2439
02:17:35.100 --> 02:17:37.920
The ass off,
making $8 an hour,
he'll come up.
Wow.

2440
02:17:37.930 --> 02:17:41.440
I have got friends that don't tip,
you know,
they say Michael Jordan tip.

2441
02:17:41.470 --> 02:17:44.360
What they see is the worst temper in the world.
I heard that.
Oh,

2442
02:17:44.370 --> 02:17:49.310
for the Tetra Jordan man,
it's crazy.
$100 million off your shoes.
Yeah,

2443
02:17:49.350 --> 02:17:52.700
there's a lot of guys.
It's hard to like to leave.
They don't believe it.

2444
02:17:52.980 --> 02:17:54.410
<v 5>No.
If I tell the story on the podcast,</v>

2445
02:17:54.530 --> 02:17:57.870
my mother said my dad from losing a lot of money because she watched to do,

2446
02:17:57.871 --> 02:18:00.820
they were playing golf and I cheat on,
I cheated cough,

2447
02:18:00.821 --> 02:18:04.060
but this guy kicked the ball out looking around and make sure nobody saw it.

2448
02:18:04.240 --> 02:18:07.570
She goes,
the guy's a crook,
my file.
I was like,
what kicked the ball out?

2449
02:18:07.571 --> 02:18:09.210
And my phone was like,
I don't know.
My mother,
my mother is,

2450
02:18:09.640 --> 02:18:14.380
he kicked the ball out and did it like secretly if you do it in like,

2451
02:18:14.381 --> 02:18:18.550
you know like joking around like cheat and if you catch me,
I cheat.

2452
02:18:18.580 --> 02:18:22.960
If you play a board game or any golf in the Ouachita a really cheat and really

2453
02:18:22.961 --> 02:18:27.310
try to beat you and do it secretly.
But if you catch me why?
I'm just kidding.

2454
02:18:27.311 --> 02:18:29.500
I mean I'm,
I don't care,

2455
02:18:29.650 --> 02:18:32.470
but I mean I'm going to cheat at any game you play.

2456
02:18:32.471 --> 02:18:35.360
If it's a board game or I don't give a shit.
Yes,
yes.

2457
02:18:35.620 --> 02:18:39.370
But if you're doing it to really win and you're going to be secretive about it,

2458
02:18:39.400 --> 02:18:43.270
there's some things going on.
That's a little bit,
I went to jail,
by the way.
Ooh.

2459
02:18:43.340 --> 02:18:47.770
Yes.
Turned out to be a big,
Ooh.
Ooh,
well famous.

2460
02:18:47.771 --> 02:18:51.760
A white collar criminal.
Really.
Bernie main off.
Nope.
Shit.

2461
02:18:54.870 --> 02:18:56.440
Well,
Bernie Madoff,
Bernie Madoff.

2462
02:18:56.441 --> 02:18:59.350
My father's friend that came to my father's friend,
uh,

2463
02:18:59.351 --> 02:19:02.500
I think his name is Paul Derosa,
and he made a fortune and they said,

2464
02:19:02.501 --> 02:19:05.410
this guy can get you 20% of your money.
The first thing Paul,
the row.

2465
02:19:05.411 --> 02:19:07.660
So it makes it made his money the right way and the hard way.
It goes.

2466
02:19:08.170 --> 02:19:13.120
Really 20% call the police.
I said,
no,
no,
no.
He's got the thing.
He goes,

2467
02:19:13.121 --> 02:19:15.730
really call the police.
Never seen it in my life.

2468
02:19:15.750 --> 02:19:17.620
I've been been this business my whole life.

2469
02:19:17.800 --> 02:19:19.870
You're telling me to make 20% on his money like that.

2470
02:19:19.900 --> 02:19:24.490
Called the cops said that way before he got caught.
Way before he got caught.

2471
02:19:24.850 --> 02:19:28.040
A lot of smart people lost a lot of money.
Steven Spielberg was

2472
02:19:28.040 --> 02:19:29.920
<v 4>one of them.
Yeah,</v>

2473
02:19:29.950 --> 02:19:32.240
a whole bunch of people that got ripped off a lot of rich people.

2474
02:19:32.241 --> 02:19:37.180
That was a huge fucking mistake.
Charities,
charities.
Oh yeah.

2475
02:19:37.190 --> 02:19:41.840
They catch up with you man.
Well,
he to catch up going,
no,
that's,

2476
02:19:41.841 --> 02:19:45.890
maybe that is the greatest scam.
I mean that he kept it going for 30 years.

2477
02:19:45.891 --> 02:19:50.360
If you paid attention to how many bankers have off themselves in 2014 no.

2478
02:19:50.690 --> 02:19:55.040
Ooh,
it's in double digits.
Yeah.
It's some weird number of bankers here.

2479
02:19:55.041 --> 02:19:57.620
All but when you're number,
when your life is a number,

2480
02:19:58.190 --> 02:20:01.670
when your life is only a number and you did it the wrong way and the Jig is up,

2481
02:20:02.240 --> 02:20:06.050
you know,
let's see.
Bankers and I'm killed.

2482
02:20:06.220 --> 02:20:09.950
They've killed themselves in 2014 it's some stupid number,
man.

2483
02:20:10.370 --> 02:20:15.370
There's like all these things going way back to 2010 2012 there's articles.

2484
02:20:16.190 --> 02:20:21.050
These motherfuckers are jumping off buildings.
I mean it's,
it's dark.

2485
02:20:21.170 --> 02:20:24.980
That's not how I'd go.
Well,
I don't want it to be a building.
You know what it is,

2486
02:20:24.981 --> 02:20:25.791
man?
Hell No.

2487
02:20:25.791 --> 02:20:29.270
It's a bunch of people that are like just super depressed about what they're

2488
02:20:29.271 --> 02:20:30.080
doing with their lives

2489
02:20:30.080 --> 02:20:33.140
<v 3>cause cause of how they define themselves.
Did you,
speaking of dues,</v>

2490
02:20:33.141 --> 02:20:36.650
jumping off bridges and buildings.
So you see homeboy on the one,

2491
02:20:36.651 --> 02:20:40.100
oh I think it was the one oh five or the one 10 tried to commit suicide.

2492
02:20:40.670 --> 02:20:44.990
When was this?
Two weeks ago.
Guess who's front row for it?

2493
02:20:45.260 --> 02:20:49.400
This guy coming home from training.
You saw the guy kill himself first of all,

2494
02:20:49.880 --> 02:20:53.720
I was in sitting there for five hours and travel cause yeah,

2495
02:20:53.721 --> 02:20:56.150
homeboy wanting to jump off.
So the cops spent in front of me,

2496
02:20:56.151 --> 02:20:59.990
blocked off everyone.
I'm sitting there like,
uh,
we're pro whatever,
an accident.

2497
02:20:59.991 --> 02:21:00.740
I'm waiting there.

2498
02:21:00.740 --> 02:21:03.740
People are getting out of their cars after an hour walk in and this one dude's

2499
02:21:03.741 --> 02:21:07.820
walking back and I go,
hey man,
how bad is it up there?
He goes,
Nah man,
look up.

2500
02:21:07.821 --> 02:21:11.540
Look at the bridge or your way.
He goes,
see that guy hanging off?
I oh shit.

2501
02:21:11.630 --> 02:21:14.390
He goes,
yeah,
he's trying to jump into traffic,
commit suicide.

2502
02:21:14.960 --> 02:21:18.380
So I literally sat there like this,
I'm not make us up.

2503
02:21:18.440 --> 02:21:22.270
The crowds started to chant,
jump,
jump,
jump.

2504
02:21:22.340 --> 02:21:23.780
After four hours I saw,

2505
02:21:23.781 --> 02:21:27.340
I look over this old lady in a key is going just doing iready there.

2506
02:21:27.341 --> 02:21:30.410
There is a time and after a while you got shit bro.
You're like,

2507
02:21:30.411 --> 02:21:31.460
you know I really have to go

2508
02:21:31.700 --> 02:21:34.260
<v 4>are great movie.
That'd be a great movie.</v>

2509
02:21:34.320 --> 02:21:39.320
A an hour and a half movie of you or anybody who's in traffic and you see this

2510
02:21:39.811 --> 02:21:44.100
mob mentality and you splice back and forth between this guy and these people

2511
02:21:44.101 --> 02:21:46.920
tell him to jump.
And the people that get

2512
02:21:47.530 --> 02:21:52.090
<v 3>is this,
this is the guy up there again.
Selfies.
Yes,
I was in that man.</v>

2513
02:21:52.091 --> 02:21:55.140
So did the guy actually jumped.
I think they talked him down.
Oh,

2514
02:21:56.260 --> 02:22:00.460
he jumped.
He might've just,
so what he did is the other side of traffic,

2515
02:22:00.640 --> 02:22:03.160
the other side of traffic was flea free flowing.

2516
02:22:03.250 --> 02:22:07.090
So he walked over to there to stop that traffic too.
And that it would literally,

2517
02:22:07.091 --> 02:22:09.070
I was there for five hours,
man.
The same thing.

2518
02:22:09.071 --> 02:22:13.990
I was in Boston and actually on my way to John Howard's,
Jim and I,

2519
02:22:14.050 --> 02:22:17.230
same thing,
traffic and people are taking selfies with the dude.

2520
02:22:17.231 --> 02:22:19.300
But before he's about to jump off these dudes,
these,

2521
02:22:19.301 --> 02:22:21.850
this guy was up there and other facetimed him though.

2522
02:22:22.720 --> 02:22:24.670
I wonder who the guy is who talks to them cause they have,

2523
02:22:24.671 --> 02:22:26.040
they have guys that go and

2524
02:22:26.040 --> 02:22:29.400
<v 2>talk to him.
I'm not gonna lie,
I feel like I could talk him out of it.
I feel it.</v>

2525
02:22:29.401 --> 02:22:33.180
Just let me up there,
Bro.
This fucking guy exists.

2526
02:22:33.320 --> 02:22:35.570
I'm just jumping [inaudible] New York City.

2527
02:22:35.600 --> 02:22:37.440
My mother and my mother has an apartment in New York City.

2528
02:22:37.590 --> 02:22:40.710
The woman across the hall,
there's a knock on the door.

2529
02:22:40.950 --> 02:22:44.750
I see these big Irish dudes with their firemen and these huge mustache,

2530
02:22:44.760 --> 02:22:49.630
just huge guys.
And the woman asked,
she goes,
hello.
And he and the guy,

2531
02:22:49.890 --> 02:22:53.430
the guy goes,
how you doing?
And she goes,
hi,
I'm fine.
And he goes,

2532
02:22:53.850 --> 02:22:57.810
were you sitting outs we use sitting out on your air conditioner?

2533
02:22:58.380 --> 02:23:02.130
And she goes,
um,
yeah.
And he said,

2534
02:23:02.131 --> 02:23:06.330
do you think that's a little unusual?
And she goes,
no.

2535
02:23:06.690 --> 02:23:07.320
And he goes,

2536
02:23:07.320 --> 02:23:11.280
you don't think sitting on your air conditioner 16 floors up is unusual.

2537
02:23:11.520 --> 02:23:16.260
And she goes,
no.
He goes,
you don't.
She goes,
oh,
and she just kinda collapsed.

2538
02:23:16.261 --> 02:23:19.530
They grabbed her,
put her on the stretcher,
you're coming with us on.
Really?

2539
02:23:19.560 --> 02:23:24.330
She was just right up.
She was a city this,
this guy wants to jump on.
This guy,

2540
02:23:24.331 --> 02:23:28.140
got to jump off the highway.
Hey Bro,
not that tall.

2541
02:23:28.230 --> 02:23:31.140
You're going to jump off your life and get a lot worse.
I mean,

2542
02:23:31.141 --> 02:23:35.790
maybe if your calculates first.
I know,
but at first it was just for attention.

2543
02:23:35.820 --> 02:23:39.270
Yeah.
Then we broke up with some girl know I can't go on and jumped up though.

2544
02:23:39.271 --> 02:23:42.980
People do jump,
but what I'm saying,
nobody dies first.
They cover themselves.
They,

2545
02:23:42.990 --> 02:23:46.590
oh,
it's your,
yeah,
your instincts kick in.

2546
02:23:46.591 --> 02:23:49.410
It's very rare that someone tries to stop.
It doesn't try to stop their fall.

2547
02:23:49.440 --> 02:23:50.700
What a horrible way to,

2548
02:23:51.020 --> 02:23:54.450
they've done studies on high enough Sam Shirt and it's only Sam,
Sarah,

2549
02:23:54.451 --> 02:23:54.960
and told me that,

2550
02:23:54.960 --> 02:23:58.360
that most of the people that jump and survive like the Golden Gate,

2551
02:23:58.380 --> 02:23:59.220
which is very rare,

2552
02:23:59.670 --> 02:24:03.930
all of them without a doubt say that halfway through they're like,
they're like,

2553
02:24:03.950 --> 02:24:07.760
oh,
why did I do this?
This was about,
yeah,

2554
02:24:07.800 --> 02:24:11.520
they all decide that's a bad idea.
I think golden gates number,
why know?

2555
02:24:11.590 --> 02:24:14.070
I have no idea.
Golden Gate I think is number one.

2556
02:24:14.071 --> 02:24:18.160
Number two is that creepy hotel and uh,
uh,

2557
02:24:18.210 --> 02:24:23.030
Denver in Colorado,
uh,
that one overlook where the fucking shining was.
Yes.

2558
02:24:23.060 --> 02:24:23.490
Yup.

2559
02:24:23.490 --> 02:24:26.670
Well Golden Gate was averaging 26 a year and that's where they put those nets

2560
02:24:26.671 --> 02:24:30.070
down.
There's a,
there's a documentary called the bridge.
Oh,

2561
02:24:30.100 --> 02:24:31.590
who's jumping off that damn thing,

2562
02:24:31.591 --> 02:24:36.591
that high 26 people a year and it's a lot of people and there's a 98% death

2563
02:24:37.651 --> 02:24:40.890
rate,
I think like 2% have survived that actual,

2564
02:24:40.891 --> 02:24:45.090
and they have to hit the water apparently at a certain angle where you break

2565
02:24:45.091 --> 02:24:48.160
your,
you know,
your break,
you hit it.
I think he hit the water 86 miles an hour.

2566
02:24:48.180 --> 02:24:50.860
Well,
if you hated life before and then I find,

2567
02:24:50.940 --> 02:24:54.480
and then you jump off a bridge and every bone in your body is broke,

2568
02:24:54.930 --> 02:24:57.870
you wake up in the hospital,
that what it is.
Every bone in your body breaks me.

2569
02:24:57.871 --> 02:24:58.704
Hit the water.

2570
02:24:58.740 --> 02:25:03.740
I guess it's not just that you water rushes into your rectum and your eyes and

2571
02:25:04.771 --> 02:25:07.050
but also you usually break your neck or your cause,
the,

2572
02:25:07.070 --> 02:25:10.750
the what it does to your jaw when you head and your feet and every,
ah,

2573
02:25:10.920 --> 02:25:13.830
because the surface tension of the water.
So the service happens to water.

2574
02:25:13.831 --> 02:25:16.290
When you,
when you hit it,
it,
it resists initially.

2575
02:25:16.620 --> 02:25:18.930
It's why if a car falls in the water it goes,
Ooh,

2576
02:25:18.931 --> 02:25:23.740
it's stops it the surface tension actually dense that will dent the car.

2577
02:25:24.010 --> 02:25:24.491
So your,

2578
02:25:24.491 --> 02:25:28.270
your feet break but then you got your chin or anything else that has to break

2579
02:25:28.271 --> 02:25:29.620
that surface tension as well.

2580
02:25:29.740 --> 02:25:33.980
You have a friend who went cliff diving in Ohio and he's telling me that he,

2581
02:25:33.981 --> 02:25:38.020
he jumped off some favorite famous cliff where everybody jumps and said,

2582
02:25:38.050 --> 02:25:40.600
it was unbelievable how hard it was when you hit the ground.

2583
02:25:40.600 --> 02:25:43.840
I was like a hundred feet.
Oh,
I only,
it was only a hundred feet.
First of all,

2584
02:25:43.841 --> 02:25:47.610
I jumped 40 feet and it was a nightmare.
I'll never do it.
I also jump,

2585
02:25:47.640 --> 02:25:51.500
I don't know,
it was 220 foot drop.
Oh my God.
Yeah.
That's crazy.

2586
02:25:52.370 --> 02:25:54.940
I'm not going to lie.
It doesn't seem that high until you look down.

2587
02:25:55.180 --> 02:25:58.900
You already fucking mind.
When you were up there,
your guts would turn inside out.

2588
02:25:58.901 --> 02:26:00.920
If you lean too much about it.

2589
02:26:00.930 --> 02:26:05.080
I'm just talking about homeboys jumping off the skyscrapers,
the way to go.

2590
02:26:05.081 --> 02:26:08.650
I feel like,
oh yeah,
that's the,
you just,
I don't know,
man.
It flying.

2591
02:26:08.651 --> 02:26:09.700
I don't want it do any of that.
I went,

2592
02:26:09.880 --> 02:26:14.380
I went parachuting and I literally was so afraid that I wasn't listening to the

2593
02:26:14.381 --> 02:26:19.180
guy on the radio in my helmet and I was holding the uh,
the,

2594
02:26:19.280 --> 02:26:23.290
that I was pulling on the guy.
So he,
I ended up,
I had a pair of hike.

2595
02:26:23.300 --> 02:26:26.890
I ended up landing a mile a mile away from where I was supposed to know because

2596
02:26:26.891 --> 02:26:31.180
I wasn't listening to him and how to glide my myself to where we should do that

2597
02:26:31.181 --> 02:26:35.470
stuff.
Boujee jumping,
skydiving,
go in the top of Sears tower,

2598
02:26:35.620 --> 02:26:39.160
cliff diving,
none of that base jumping where you're already doing something.

2599
02:26:39.161 --> 02:26:42.010
That's like waiting cons though.
The pros and cons.

2600
02:26:42.011 --> 02:26:45.340
Like I was in Costa Rica and my friend wanted to jump off this cliff.

2601
02:26:45.341 --> 02:26:48.370
It was like it was a rope and even a bungee cord and they go,
well yeah,

2602
02:26:48.371 --> 02:26:52.930
a lot of guys do it.
I'm not doing that.
You're looking at the pros and cons.

2603
02:26:53.100 --> 02:26:54.030
Crash is courage.

2604
02:26:55.070 --> 02:26:57.070
Courage is the funny thing because a lot of base numbers would say,

2605
02:26:57.071 --> 02:27:01.210
I could never get into a cage and fight another killer and some guys I can never

2606
02:27:01.211 --> 02:27:05.320
get on stage and do stand up courage as a compartmentalized thing.
Man.

2607
02:27:05.390 --> 02:27:09.220
There's pros and cons though.
My brain waves it.
Let's see.
Jumping on an airplane.

2608
02:27:09.410 --> 02:27:12.940
Well that'd be cool for about 30 seconds.
What if it's not cool at?
Wow,

2609
02:27:12.941 --> 02:27:13.660
look at that.

2610
02:27:13.660 --> 02:27:18.660
What is he doing up at the top of a skyscraper and your brain selfies to another

2611
02:27:19.181 --> 02:27:22.720
level.
Say you mean he's not,
he's not going to base jump.
He's just climbing that.

2612
02:27:22.850 --> 02:27:27.220
Yeah,
that is a,
that's bad ass.
No,
it's not.
That's retarded.
Yeah.

2613
02:27:27.390 --> 02:27:30.060
If you're an axial rock climber,
I don't look at that and go,

2614
02:27:30.070 --> 02:27:32.740
that's gangsta sweating my fucking too.
I'm sweating,

2615
02:27:34.220 --> 02:27:38.170
sweating these tight ass car picture.
Oh my God.

2616
02:27:38.500 --> 02:27:42.610
Oh my God.
Oh my God.
There's a guy above him taking that picture.
Jesus fucking,

2617
02:27:42.740 --> 02:27:45.880
so there's just climbing up that thing.
I'm sweating dude.

2618
02:27:45.881 --> 02:27:50.881
My hands or hands together quads are dripping when Lana phone or is that normal?

2619
02:27:52.350 --> 02:27:55.540
That's totally normal.
If you think,
if you just fuck that guy and his ass,

2620
02:27:55.780 --> 02:27:58.680
he would back up to your rhythm just so that you would knock him.

2621
02:27:58.690 --> 02:28:00.820
I gotta fuck you dude.
You're climbing too high.

2622
02:28:01.360 --> 02:28:04.680
It's just we're going to fuck and we're not going to do it fast.
Dude,
why?

2623
02:28:04.790 --> 02:28:09.280
You guys are nuts.
Why Tingling right now?

2624
02:28:10.360 --> 02:28:14.710
My Dick,
my dick is like pulsating and clamping.
I remember climbing a train.

2625
02:28:14.711 --> 02:28:18.640
I was holding onto the bridge in the red shirt,
upper left hand corner.

2626
02:28:18.810 --> 02:28:22.430
What the fuck?
What is that all my God.

2627
02:28:22.431 --> 02:28:26.900
Look how high it is doing please.
The wind blows.

2628
02:28:27.600 --> 02:28:30.900
Oh my God,
is he slept again,
pros and cons,
but if a wind,

2629
02:28:31.510 --> 02:28:34.900
you get a very cool view from high up con,
you done enough.

2630
02:28:35.120 --> 02:28:37.400
How come it doesn't freak you out when you look out the window on a plane?

2631
02:28:38.210 --> 02:28:41.600
I don't know,
Dude.
I,
I like that.
It's not like that.
It's weird.

2632
02:28:42.240 --> 02:28:44.030
I see on the freaks me out a little bit,

2633
02:28:44.120 --> 02:28:46.720
especially just that plane went missing when I get on a play,

2634
02:28:46.721 --> 02:28:49.530
not like say this bitch goes missing.
Who's a chance?

2635
02:28:51.270 --> 02:28:55.550
I'm such,
oh my God.
Oh my God.
I'm having a really hard time with this.

2636
02:28:55.560 --> 02:29:00.380
He too bad either.
It makes my stomach.
What is he doing?

2637
02:29:00.530 --> 02:29:03.770
Don't do.
Don't do this dude.
What are you doing?
Shit.

2638
02:29:05.000 --> 02:29:09.290
He's got something on his head.
Like what ways to go pro for sure.

2639
02:29:09.650 --> 02:29:13.790
Oh my God.
How far is he walking?
What a rush.
I am sweating so hard.

2640
02:29:14.530 --> 02:29:17.690
Oh my God,
this guy's crazy.

2641
02:29:17.870 --> 02:29:20.810
Holy fucking shit is awful.

2642
02:29:21.290 --> 02:29:25.130
How many of these guys here I'm getting,
I'm getting carsick.
Oh my God,

2643
02:29:25.131 --> 02:29:28.250
he's doing it again.
He's doing it again.
This is insane.

2644
02:29:28.370 --> 02:29:31.920
What's the name of this video?
Have you seen homeboys who climbed the,
uh,

2645
02:29:31.950 --> 02:29:36.650
the mountains though,
without any leashes?
Crazy Ukrainian climbing guy.

2646
02:29:36.830 --> 02:29:40.940
Oh my God.
That crazy.
You crazy guys.
I'm sweating.

2647
02:29:42.200 --> 02:29:43.033
I was

2648
02:29:43.460 --> 02:29:47.450
<v 5>climbing a tree.
My friend Eric Wagner high school.
I was only maybe,
I dunno,</v>

2649
02:29:47.480 --> 02:29:51.710
30 feet up high enough to really hurt my legs and I'm holding onto the branch

2650
02:29:51.711 --> 02:29:55.370
and I won't let go.
And he goes,
let go of the branch.
I go,
I,
I'm not going good.

2651
02:29:55.400 --> 02:29:58.820
He goes,
cause I was,
I was scuttling to get to the next to safer.

2652
02:29:59.330 --> 02:30:02.720
And so he's holding on and he's not afraid at all and I'm like this.

2653
02:30:02.721 --> 02:30:07.110
And he reaches over and squeezes my package.

2654
02:30:07.111 --> 02:30:11.420
She goes horrendous.
And I go,
Eric,
please stop doing that.
And he goes,
ah,

2655
02:30:11.421 --> 02:30:13.760
it's okay.
Or Ag and I go

2656
02:30:14.120 --> 02:30:15.370
<v 2>was the most uncomfortable thing.</v>

2657
02:30:15.580 --> 02:30:17.560
And I had to watch him and he's looking me in the eye and he goes,

2658
02:30:18.390 --> 02:30:22.390
and he's just squeezing my dick and balls.
Like it's one of those two words.

2659
02:30:22.391 --> 02:30:25.750
The clouds does it more than three times doing it.

2660
02:30:25.770 --> 02:30:30.550
You have to be as to get down to the ground.
When I say I literally,

2661
02:30:30.551 --> 02:30:33.310
I was going to,
I'm going to fucking kill you,
but it wasn't going to happen.

2662
02:30:33.311 --> 02:30:36.570
Did you let him go?
No,
he was bigger and stronger than anyone off.
Hey,

2663
02:30:36.580 --> 02:30:39.100
can come anyway,
sort of jamming you off.
I came,
but here's that.

2664
02:30:39.101 --> 02:30:42.370
But let me explain it to establish your position.

2665
02:30:43.140 --> 02:30:45.100
You know how I was like,
oh,
it doesn't seem that high.

2666
02:30:45.110 --> 02:30:49.270
The golden gate bridge on a spring break in college in Missouri.

2667
02:30:49.271 --> 02:30:52.530
My buddies wanting to go cliff diving and I'm afraid of heights if I didn't tell

2668
02:30:52.531 --> 02:30:55.480
him this.
So everyone's like,
let's do it and you don't.
I'm like,
yeah bro,

2669
02:30:55.481 --> 02:31:00.070
sounds awesome.
You just chicks around.
So we pull up.
I'm,
I'm thinking,
I'm like,

2670
02:31:00.071 --> 02:31:02.920
man,
I hope this isn't that high up.
You know what I'm saying?
I'm like,
Dear God,

2671
02:31:02.921 --> 02:31:05.260
I hope it's not that high up cause I'm trying to act like a bad ass.

2672
02:31:05.920 --> 02:31:09.820
So we pull up on the boat and I'm like,
oh no,
look that bad.
And we get up there,

2673
02:31:09.821 --> 02:31:12.960
it's a beast to get up there.
We get up there and there's no turnaround.

2674
02:31:13.020 --> 02:31:16.930
You can't go back down.
You have to jump everyone.
Everyone's like,
yeah,

2675
02:31:16.931 --> 02:31:20.220
see a shop in the water.
Everyone jumps.
I'm last one

2676
02:31:20.370 --> 02:31:24.240
<v 3>by myself sweating like I do not want to do this,</v>

2677
02:31:24.450 --> 02:31:29.040
but I have to do it.
Then some guy down below goes to speak out of shit goes,

2678
02:31:29.400 --> 02:31:34.230
God,
you buzzy job already.
And I hear my friends in the boat go,

2679
02:31:34.380 --> 02:31:37.170
yeah,
so I'm like,
shit,
I have to do this.

2680
02:31:37.740 --> 02:31:41.910
I jumped the scariest thing ever done.
He was high as shit.

2681
02:31:41.990 --> 02:31:45.930
I had contacts at the time,
my head,
it's the one I kind of like,
belly flop,

2682
02:31:46.170 --> 02:31:48.990
head hits,
the water contact goes shooting out.

2683
02:31:49.230 --> 02:31:51.360
I was so scared and mad.

2684
02:31:51.750 --> 02:31:54.540
I literally didn't talk my friends for the rest of the day where he was like,

2685
02:31:54.541 --> 02:31:57.090
fuck that guy on the boat and was just upset.
Man,

2686
02:31:57.230 --> 02:31:57.710
<v 5>if you're going to,</v>

2687
02:31:57.710 --> 02:32:00.800
I've never told this story and I haven't told the story because it's a scary
one.

2688
02:32:00.860 --> 02:32:03.020
Um,
I've never told this story before,
but I'm going to tell you,

2689
02:32:03.021 --> 02:32:04.820
you don't know the story,
Joe.
Um,

2690
02:32:04.910 --> 02:32:09.910
last summer I went to south of France and I was with my wife and my buddy and

2691
02:32:12.441 --> 02:32:16.580
he,
the first day were there.
He goes,
we're going to go cliff diving.
And I said,

2692
02:32:16.670 --> 02:32:20.030
hmm,
I don't like that idea.
Okay.
It's a group of people.

2693
02:32:20.480 --> 02:32:23.960
One guy's the best horseback rider in the world,
whatever random stuff.

2694
02:32:24.440 --> 02:32:28.090
So we get there,
we get there and we're up there and it's,
it's,
it's,

2695
02:32:28.160 --> 02:32:32.660
it's the ocean number one.
Number two,
it's craggy rocks.
Number three,

2696
02:32:32.661 --> 02:32:34.700
it's very high.
And number four,
it's cold.

2697
02:32:34.940 --> 02:32:39.050
So I look over and my instincts and I go with,
so if we jump,

2698
02:32:39.650 --> 02:32:41.330
where are we supposed to swim too?

2699
02:32:41.930 --> 02:32:45.770
And the surfer who was from there said over there,

2700
02:32:45.771 --> 02:32:49.280
but I don't like the way the tide is washing up on those rocks.

2701
02:32:50.060 --> 02:32:53.570
So I go,
hmm,
that's all I had to hear.
Not going to do a pros and cons,

2702
02:32:53.600 --> 02:32:56.390
not going to do it.
The horseback rider jumps his,

2703
02:32:56.780 --> 02:33:00.770
his chubby girl jumps and guess who else jumps?
My wife,
mother and my children,

2704
02:33:01.130 --> 02:33:03.830
she just goes,
she talked about it.
What?
She's like,

2705
02:33:03.831 --> 02:33:06.710
I'm doing this to competitive chick.
She goes,
oh,
that girl's going to do it.

2706
02:33:06.740 --> 02:33:11.270
I'm doing it.
So that's my,
that's the mother of my children.
So guess what?

2707
02:33:11.300 --> 02:33:13.040
I got to go in and make sure she's okay.

2708
02:33:14.630 --> 02:33:18.650
So I jumped in and you're scared shitless.

2709
02:33:18.830 --> 02:33:20.930
I wasn't scared about jumping.
I was mad.

2710
02:33:21.050 --> 02:33:22.880
I was mad because I don't like the ocean.

2711
02:33:22.881 --> 02:33:25.280
I was mad because I didn't have a good instinct about it.

2712
02:33:25.280 --> 02:33:27.740
I was mad because I don't know that area.

2713
02:33:27.741 --> 02:33:31.130
And the mother and children decides it doesn't really matter about they see your

2714
02:33:31.131 --> 02:33:33.520
wife said fuck these kids,
I'm going to jump in this Rochelle,

2715
02:33:33.530 --> 02:33:37.010
my wife is fairly competitive and she's not going to let somebody pyre so,

2716
02:33:37.011 --> 02:33:39.530
so what right.
That's ridiculous.

2717
02:33:39.531 --> 02:33:43.820
Now I jump in and I know you and I are the same mine cause your cost is like

2718
02:33:43.821 --> 02:33:47.510
this too.
I jump in and I,
I swim,

2719
02:33:48.260 --> 02:33:51.410
we swim and now we have to go up on the rocks and the waves are hitting these

2720
02:33:51.411 --> 02:33:53.840
rocks.
So I said to Amanda,
I go,

2721
02:33:53.930 --> 02:33:56.840
we're going to have to ride this wave onto these rocks.

2722
02:33:57.770 --> 02:34:01.250
Let me go first so I can turn around and pick,
grab you.
No big deal.

2723
02:34:01.940 --> 02:34:06.140
I go and as I go and turn around,

2724
02:34:06.170 --> 02:34:10.880
I get hit with a second wave,
which just came out of nowhere.
It,
it,

2725
02:34:11.100 --> 02:34:13.190
it literally knocks me,

2726
02:34:13.730 --> 02:34:17.890
rolls me on this really sharp coral.
So my feet,
my hands,

2727
02:34:17.920 --> 02:34:22.270
everything's all full of blood.
My worst,
my worst legs are all full of blood.

2728
02:34:22.570 --> 02:34:26.650
She starts to kind of panic.
She goes,
Ooh,
I like that.
And the waves and stuff.

2729
02:34:26.651 --> 02:34:30.480
Cause I got the wind knocked out of me and I'm telling you right now,
I,

2730
02:34:30.481 --> 02:34:32.320
I grabbed her and she goes,
get away from me.

2731
02:34:32.321 --> 02:34:36.520
She thought I was going to drown her.
So I have to calm,
I'm calm a batch.

2732
02:34:36.580 --> 02:34:37.960
Well she just didn't want it.
She didn't,

2733
02:34:38.080 --> 02:34:39.040
she thought I was going to bring her down.

2734
02:34:39.041 --> 02:34:43.510
So just so I have to calm her down so it gets so bad cause I can't grab her.

2735
02:34:43.511 --> 02:34:47.500
I tried to get her back up on the rocks again.
Washed off again.
Okay.

2736
02:34:48.100 --> 02:34:52.920
So now it,
now I'm swelling at seawater.
She's swollen seawater and,
and,

2737
02:34:52.980 --> 02:34:55.390
and I'm literally,
I'm literally talking to me like this.
Like,
all right,

2738
02:34:55.391 --> 02:34:58.630
no big deal.
We're just going to,
we're not going to stay here.
Let's relax.

2739
02:34:58.810 --> 02:35:02.050
Let's just swim further out so we can get used to these waves.

2740
02:35:02.170 --> 02:35:05.080
Let's wait until it calms down.
It's crisis mode.
Christ,

2741
02:35:05.680 --> 02:35:08.050
you're telling them tall crisis mode.

2742
02:35:08.770 --> 02:35:12.910
And I realize that I'm panicked and I don't really actually have the strength.

2743
02:35:12.911 --> 02:35:14.770
I'm worried that I'm going to go,
I'm trying to,

2744
02:35:14.830 --> 02:35:19.120
I got to hold her up because she's,
she's strong.
And I think,
and I,

2745
02:35:19.121 --> 02:35:20.770
and I think I've got to get behind her,

2746
02:35:21.010 --> 02:35:26.010
but she's literally pushing me away now she grabs onto me and now I'm like,

2747
02:35:26.170 --> 02:35:26.530
oh boy,

2748
02:35:26.530 --> 02:35:29.710
I gotta I gotta get it together here because she's holding on to me and kind of

2749
02:35:29.711 --> 02:35:33.790
pulling me under the dude who's the surfer sees what's going on.

2750
02:35:34.330 --> 02:35:39.100
He dives in,
he grabs her.
I literally,
I'm holding her.

2751
02:35:39.130 --> 02:35:42.070
He comes up and I go take her,
take her like really calm.

2752
02:35:42.071 --> 02:35:45.280
I gotta take her cause she's panicking.
He grabs her,

2753
02:35:45.670 --> 02:35:50.670
he ends up having to put her on top of him and he lets the wave ride them up.

2754
02:35:51.850 --> 02:35:56.140
He gets his whole back and legs ripped up and he pulls her on shore.

2755
02:35:56.141 --> 02:36:00.730
So she's a bloody mess.
I ride the next wave in my feet,
my hands,

2756
02:36:00.731 --> 02:36:03.950
my body.
I'm all ripped up.
I'm all wrapped up for the rest of the day.

2757
02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:07.660
The vacation never been more angry,
so bad by the way,

2758
02:36:07.661 --> 02:36:12.661
that the helicopter that the rescue helicopter shows up and I,

2759
02:36:12.971 --> 02:36:15.910
and people all crowded around like what they saw.
Everything happen.

2760
02:36:15.920 --> 02:36:17.800
Then I'm full of blood and we're all full of blood.

2761
02:36:18.130 --> 02:36:20.560
The rescue helicopter comes up,
which is by the way,

2762
02:36:20.561 --> 02:36:24.720
some $20,000 fine or something.
We,
I grabbed Mandy,

2763
02:36:24.721 --> 02:36:26.620
I grab it by grabbing,
I'd go to my friends,
I go,

2764
02:36:26.650 --> 02:36:28.210
let's get in the car now they're going,

2765
02:36:28.260 --> 02:36:30.730
if they think it catches and figure out it's us.

2766
02:36:31.030 --> 02:36:34.750
So we jumped in the car and drive off.
That was the scariest I would,

2767
02:36:34.751 --> 02:36:38.200
I realized there was that the sea can take you so quickly,

2768
02:36:38.201 --> 02:36:40.830
you just go to the bottom.
Then I finding you,
we'll see you later.
Love.

2769
02:36:40.831 --> 02:36:44.680
And that shit happens all the time because people are,

2770
02:36:44.681 --> 02:36:48.010
if you don't know how to ride,
you know,
currents and waves,

2771
02:36:48.011 --> 02:36:52.900
if you're not used to it,
if we need a good swimmer,
swimmer is your life.

2772
02:36:52.960 --> 02:36:55.150
Yeah.
And I ended the swimmer.
You know what I thought about,
you know,

2773
02:36:55.151 --> 02:36:57.490
what's crazy to me,
into your family.
Think about me.

2774
02:36:57.760 --> 02:37:00.720
I thought about my kids getting without their mom.
I wasn't going back without,

2775
02:37:00.760 --> 02:37:02.140
without their mom.
I wasn't gonna Happen.

2776
02:37:02.470 --> 02:37:05.970
And that's way scarier than me losing my life.
I'd never had that expression.

2777
02:37:05.971 --> 02:37:10.900
If you didn't jump in.
Well that's exactly,
imagine if you didn't exactly,

2778
02:37:13.330 --> 02:37:17.620
but it sounds like there was a lot of space between her jumping in and a surfer,

2779
02:37:17.980 --> 02:37:22.250
the surfer in,
Oh my God,
he didn't know we were in Trump.
Ah,
oh my God.

2780
02:37:22.820 --> 02:37:26.780
That's why I jumped in and that's why you get a big fight after,
you know,

2781
02:37:26.781 --> 02:37:31.470
it was so,
I was thankful she was,
uh,
she was okay.
Whew.

2782
02:37:31.520 --> 02:37:34.840
That was a bad situation.
I don't even like telling a story cause it was cause,

2783
02:37:35.270 --> 02:37:40.270
cause of the feeling it gave me like I didn't feel it's not good to feel that

2784
02:37:40.581 --> 02:37:43.930
vulnerable to see is a scary bitch.
The ski is,

2785
02:37:44.570 --> 02:37:48.140
I don't fuck around the ocean.
My buddy who is something that's not fun.

2786
02:37:48.170 --> 02:37:50.030
My buddy used to have to take,
uh,
he would,

2787
02:37:50.031 --> 02:37:55.031
he would make his money by sailing boats in the winter for rich people up the

2788
02:37:55.371 --> 02:37:58.040
Atlantic,
which w during storm season sailboats.

2789
02:37:58.310 --> 02:38:00.470
And he was only one of the few people willing to do that.

2790
02:38:01.190 --> 02:38:06.140
And I say he got caught in a storm for 23 hours where the swells were going over

2791
02:38:06.141 --> 02:38:08.090
his body.
They couldn't,

2792
02:38:08.091 --> 02:38:12.650
they had to literally fly a guy from Alaska in a special boat cause nobody else

2793
02:38:12.651 --> 02:38:13.071
could do it,

2794
02:38:13.071 --> 02:38:17.210
could navigate the storm who tugged him in and he strapped himself and he was

2795
02:38:17.211 --> 02:38:21.590
getting hypothermia as the water and he couldn't see the waves at night.

2796
02:38:21.591 --> 02:38:24.740
He had wait to hear them because they would just come over the boat and the

2797
02:38:24.741 --> 02:38:29.120
whole boat would submerge that happened.
That happened for him.

2798
02:38:29.121 --> 02:38:32.890
That happened for about 10 hours.
Just kept some merging and they were out.

2799
02:38:32.900 --> 02:38:35.600
You keep 20 set from cap size and you've got to steer,

2800
02:38:35.630 --> 02:38:40.140
you can't eat the way you've got to be an expert.
And he was so,
so,
uh,

2801
02:38:40.190 --> 02:38:43.250
they were stuck out there and you're at the mercy of the C and a lot of times

2802
02:38:43.251 --> 02:38:46.160
you just get washed up on rocks and you die.
So we had to keep the rocks.

2803
02:38:46.520 --> 02:38:50.030
He got to keep away from the rocks and he had to keep the boat.

2804
02:38:50.600 --> 02:38:54.770
He had to deal with these insane waves at night where you can't see them.

2805
02:38:54.771 --> 02:38:55.211
They just,

2806
02:38:55.211 --> 02:38:59.030
another law rocks and the water and the water got to simultaneously worry about

2807
02:38:59.031 --> 02:39:02.930
both towns.
Right.
And you're in a metal boat for 10 hours.
It's a wood boat.

2808
02:39:02.960 --> 02:39:07.190
It's a wood blood.
Yeah,
it's a wood boat.
It's a sailboat.
Oh,
a sale.

2809
02:39:07.250 --> 02:39:10.880
You can keep that shit keyed that ocean shit.
And I said to him,
I said,

2810
02:39:11.180 --> 02:39:13.430
do you ever,
what kind of what?
You have a life vest?
He goes,

2811
02:39:13.431 --> 02:39:16.220
you know where life vests w what do you mean?
He goes,
you look,

2812
02:39:16.250 --> 02:39:18.590
if you get knocked over,
you're dying,
you guys.

2813
02:39:18.591 --> 02:39:21.920
And and chances are life vest is going to keep you cold in a live longer than

2814
02:39:21.921 --> 02:39:23.970
you want to be.
You.
You're not.
And even if they can,

2815
02:39:24.320 --> 02:39:27.530
they can't come back and find you because they can't get you out back on the

2816
02:39:27.531 --> 02:39:29.180
boat.
They can't do it.
And that kind of weather,

2817
02:39:29.181 --> 02:39:33.080
you're probably injured anyway that those guys are hardcore.
Keep it,

2818
02:39:33.260 --> 02:39:37.310
keep Humboldt,
that fucking deadliest catch show you ever watched that show nuts?

2819
02:39:37.770 --> 02:39:40.270
Well,
those guys are up there just catching the craft.

2820
02:39:40.440 --> 02:39:42.350
How much town delicious could crabs be?

2821
02:39:42.870 --> 02:39:45.260
Somebody decided that this is what they wanted to do with their time.

2822
02:39:45.280 --> 02:39:46.250
If you fall in that water,

2823
02:39:46.280 --> 02:39:50.040
you got about two minutes before you have for your dead Hypothermia,
your dad,

2824
02:39:50.110 --> 02:39:54.920
it has to be better ways to make money.
I would imagine her in the sea last.

2825
02:39:55.400 --> 02:39:57.800
I'll shave my body.
Get paid by shame my body.

2826
02:39:57.801 --> 02:40:01.730
I'll Tan and take stories and become uh,
uh,
gay.
Uh,
a stripper.

2827
02:40:01.760 --> 02:40:06.520
You're already there.
You Click.
We did did it just for the adventure.
No.
Yeah.

2828
02:40:06.600 --> 02:40:09.470
Click.
Rita was a god damn crabber.
Oh,
I thought he meant he was a stripper.
No,

2829
02:40:10.440 --> 02:40:13.980
just fuse a crabber.
Yeah.
He went to fucking recently.

2830
02:40:14.100 --> 02:40:17.190
<v 2>No,
when you was your day.
Yeah.
Well he's the toughest fucking wild man.</v>

2831
02:40:17.191 --> 02:40:20.840
Decided he wasn't going to get a boat and just join and become a fucking crap.

2832
02:40:22.520 --> 02:40:27.210
It's another level.
He's a rugged man.
Think.
Yeah.
Guy Decides for an adventure.

2833
02:40:27.211 --> 02:40:30.940
He's going to join a fucking crab fishing boat.
And I'll ask,
you know,

2834
02:40:30.960 --> 02:40:35.220
who wouldn't do that?
Brennan Chop is tough as he as no interest hates nature.

2835
02:40:35.221 --> 02:40:39.870
I'd rather go work at Starbucks.
I love the ocean.
I love the ocean,
man.

2836
02:40:40.200 --> 02:40:43.770
I Love Surfing.
I love stuff like that.
Camping,
you can keep it.
You know what?

2837
02:40:43.771 --> 02:40:46.920
I'd love,
man,
I love being by the ocean.
I love looking at it.

2838
02:40:46.921 --> 02:40:49.560
I think those neighborhoods more mellow,

2839
02:40:49.590 --> 02:40:51.270
like neighborhoods that are near the ocean.

2840
02:40:51.450 --> 02:40:53.550
The problem is they're also more crowded.
Listen man,

2841
02:40:53.640 --> 02:40:57.210
whatever I'm of them I didn't think were discovery.
I got to do this,
this thing,

2842
02:40:57.211 --> 02:41:01.020
and I'm talking to the great white expert who did the documentary on those great

2843
02:41:01.021 --> 02:41:05.730
whites that breached the water South Africa,
and I said,
I say to him,
literally,

2844
02:41:05.731 --> 02:41:09.870
I'd never forget this.
I go there,
they're great whites in the Santa Monica Bay.

2845
02:41:09.871 --> 02:41:14.430
And he goes,
uh,
yeah dude,
a lot,
and I'm going to talk like that.

2846
02:41:14.431 --> 02:41:19.080
That's how you talk.
I know,
but for the,
for the story,
this is actually,
he said,

2847
02:41:19.110 --> 02:41:22.470
oh,
and by the way,
not only are there great whites,

2848
02:41:22.620 --> 02:41:26.490
I talked like me and my stories and shock Cousteau once said,

2849
02:41:26.491 --> 02:41:30.840
thank you for saying shock and he goes up.
I said,
yeah,
but little ones.
He goes,

2850
02:41:30.841 --> 02:41:35.770
we tagged the 21 footer about 200 feet off the Malibu shore.
Mm.

2851
02:41:35.910 --> 02:41:39.540
I was like,
where?
They say,
where are the fucking signs?

2852
02:41:39.541 --> 02:41:43.230
21 foot Great White Chevy with thins out there.

2853
02:41:43.310 --> 02:41:46.740
That's why I only surfed when there's a bunch of people,
so it has options.

2854
02:41:46.741 --> 02:41:47.640
I'm not even trying to be funny,

2855
02:41:47.641 --> 02:41:50.130
but I won't surf like with just me and another buddy.

2856
02:41:50.370 --> 02:41:52.560
I'll wait like this bunch of people around like,
all right,

2857
02:41:52.561 --> 02:41:55.470
do you know anybody who's ever been bitten while surfing or attack while
surfing,

2858
02:41:56.190 --> 02:41:59.010
surfing?
Nothing.
It doesn't always happen,

2859
02:41:59.220 --> 02:42:02.520
but you got to think that what you're doing when you're surfing is you're

2860
02:42:02.521 --> 02:42:06.390
mimicking what a seal looks like that.
Yeah.
Which is their main food source.

2861
02:42:06.420 --> 02:42:07.410
And on top of it,

2862
02:42:07.680 --> 02:42:12.300
you're doing it like a fishing lore where you'd go all the way to the shore and

2863
02:42:12.301 --> 02:42:16.210
they're right back.
Oh,
it's why our bodies,

2864
02:42:17.610 --> 02:42:21.520
why can't we make him so we don't look like fucking color blindness?

2865
02:42:21.990 --> 02:42:25.200
So everything looks the same,
but all right,
so make,
make them,
you know,

2866
02:42:25.201 --> 02:42:27.570
so if it's,
if it's black,
a seal looks black.

2867
02:42:30.010 --> 02:42:33.810
He said that when you were on a wooden board and you're wearing rubber for them,

2868
02:42:33.960 --> 02:42:37.320
um,
evolutionarily it doesn't make any sense that you're not their food source.

2869
02:42:37.470 --> 02:42:41.220
So when they do bite you,
it's almost always an accident.
However,

2870
02:42:41.850 --> 02:42:45.580
I told you the David Bland Story About,
Oh,
uh,

2871
02:42:45.600 --> 02:42:48.090
he decided part of his magic show and I don't think he heard it.

2872
02:42:48.220 --> 02:42:53.210
He showed it to me on his iPhone.
He went and bought a day off of shore,
um,

2873
02:42:53.310 --> 02:42:54.900
from,
I guess Los Angeles,

2874
02:42:55.260 --> 02:42:58.350
I think it was near Guadalupe island or something like that.
Uh,

2875
02:42:58.410 --> 02:43:01.920
he put a weight belt on,
held his breath.

2876
02:43:02.250 --> 02:43:04.050
He can hold his breath for longer than anybody in the world.

2877
02:43:04.051 --> 02:43:08.300
I held his breath and a Tuxedo real quick.
I don't believe the story.
Oh,
well,

2878
02:43:08.310 --> 02:43:09.810
he's got video on it.
We've got video on it.

2879
02:43:11.230 --> 02:43:14.730
They know this is real video musician,
magician,

2880
02:43:14.820 --> 02:43:19.420
this Israel video and he ate a banana underwater while these 24 foot great

2881
02:43:19.421 --> 02:43:23.940
whites just circled him and he put that on TV I had,

2882
02:43:23.950 --> 02:43:26.290
for whatever reason he wants to say he was going to save it.

2883
02:43:26.290 --> 02:43:30.730
Then he decided it didn't fit with us because it's a friend that gets 100% of

2884
02:43:30.731 --> 02:43:35.650
flights,
right?
Yea Man.
The Guy Bruce Jenner,

2885
02:43:36.310 --> 02:43:39.700
David Blaine story.
Well,
it just seems a little dude.
He did magic for you.

2886
02:43:39.701 --> 02:43:44.500
How freaky was that?
David Blaine was legit.
I went to a party at Calvin's house.

2887
02:43:44.940 --> 02:43:48.850
Kids party while I was there.
I was Deb.
No idea.
I don't have a kid showed up.

2888
02:43:48.851 --> 02:43:53.200
There's a jump castle.
David Blaine jumps out this bitch.
Hey Brendan.

2889
02:43:53.470 --> 02:43:57.230
David Blaine started doing tricks,
said some crazy shit.
Ever seen him.

2890
02:43:58.180 --> 02:44:00.310
He'll freak you out.
You think you think you,

2891
02:44:00.311 --> 02:44:03.430
you think you know magic and all I could focus was on the shoes.

2892
02:44:03.431 --> 02:44:08.200
He's doing all this magical,
I could focus on his shoes.
They were laced so tight.

2893
02:44:08.260 --> 02:44:11.550
I was like,
Bro,
is there some sort of,
it doesn't spend money I'll do from here.

2894
02:44:11.551 --> 02:44:13.930
That's not spend money.
I'm telling you the tightest,

2895
02:44:14.080 --> 02:44:16.510
literally impossible to get them any tighter.

2896
02:44:16.540 --> 02:44:20.860
It was all I could stare at owns black,
new balance jeans,
black,

2897
02:44:21.010 --> 02:44:24.730
black jeans,
black jeans will not sit black.

2898
02:44:24.731 --> 02:44:27.610
New balances does not wear clothes,
does not care about clothes,

2899
02:44:27.611 --> 02:44:32.210
does not care about money.
How come he is obsessed with,
with um,

2900
02:44:32.380 --> 02:44:33.670
examples of human suffering.

2901
02:44:33.671 --> 02:44:38.290
Like he reads all about all different things like the,
that did Bobby sands,

2902
02:44:38.360 --> 02:44:41.230
the Holocaust.
I mean,
he's always interested in human endurance.

2903
02:44:41.231 --> 02:44:45.250
He's fascinated with how human beings can suffer with dignity.
The,
the most,

2904
02:44:45.280 --> 02:44:50.280
the book that really changed his life was Viktor Frankl's book man's search for

2905
02:44:50.291 --> 02:44:53.980
meaning.
And David's always,
he watched his mother,
I'm not talking about school.

2906
02:44:53.981 --> 02:44:58.390
He watched his mother die of cancer.
And I,
I think it changed him forever.

2907
02:44:58.880 --> 02:45:03.770
And [inaudible] everyone,
my brother look like brothers.
They certainly do.

2908
02:45:03.790 --> 02:45:08.260
Could look like you were in my neighborhood,
my brother.
It look like his brother.

2909
02:45:08.470 --> 02:45:11.560
You could,
you could.
All right.

2910
02:45:11.561 --> 02:45:14.890
Whatever crazy about it.
So,
um,

2911
02:45:15.430 --> 02:45:18.010
where are you fighting our Lawsky again,
it's going to be in Vancouver,

2912
02:45:18.011 --> 02:45:21.070
Vancouver one 74.
Let me,
I always wanted to ask this.

2913
02:45:21.190 --> 02:45:23.890
So that's about how many weeks right now?
Six,

2914
02:45:23.980 --> 02:45:28.690
six weeks away now when you like gear up for a fight like that,
when,

2915
02:45:28.740 --> 02:45:31.030
what do you do differently than say what you're doing?

2916
02:45:31.031 --> 02:45:34.000
Like you're always working out,
you're always in sort of like maintenance mode,

2917
02:45:34.600 --> 02:45:37.600
right?
You were always in constant learning mode.

2918
02:45:37.810 --> 02:45:40.000
Constantly workings to keeping your conditioning up.

2919
02:45:40.180 --> 02:45:44.260
What changes between just training and then boom,

2920
02:45:44.290 --> 02:45:48.760
it's time to train for a fun.
Yeah,
the intensity for sure.
And then like sparring,

2921
02:45:49.010 --> 02:45:53.410
like tomorrow I'm sparring with this specific training partner to mimic our

2922
02:45:53.411 --> 02:45:53.890
Lawsky.

2923
02:45:53.890 --> 02:45:58.330
Usually I'm just going to rain train with Mark Munoz and pat come and stuff like

2924
02:45:58.331 --> 02:46:02.390
that.
And then now there's a game plan implemented,
you know,
so with,

2925
02:46:02.391 --> 02:46:04.840
with the rounds and I'm sticking to the game plan and stuff like that,

2926
02:46:04.960 --> 02:46:06.340
everything is way more intense.

2927
02:46:06.520 --> 02:46:10.280
My Diet's on point of people make my food now are on point.

2928
02:46:10.460 --> 02:46:14.060
<v 3>Everything's really,
really serious.
What do you do differently with your diet?</v>

2929
02:46:14.061 --> 02:46:17.240
What do you change as far as like what you eat?
Uh,
when I'm out of camp,

2930
02:46:17.241 --> 02:46:21.260
I usually,
I just like eat healthy in general.
Like I juice every morning.
He,

2931
02:46:21.290 --> 02:46:23.960
obviously people have their things against juice but juice every morning.

2932
02:46:24.080 --> 02:46:27.110
But if I'm out with friends,
like if I,
if I go out with Brian,

2933
02:46:27.111 --> 02:46:31.070
I'll have a cheese plate,
I'll have a beer here and there.
But now,
I mean,

2934
02:46:31.520 --> 02:46:35.360
I don't go,
I rarely ever eat out.
All my meals are cooked.

2935
02:46:35.480 --> 02:46:40.330
Everything's a Paleo Diet.
I don't do any breads,
nothing like that.
Yeah,
that's,

2936
02:46:40.520 --> 02:46:43.850
you've been doing that for a while,
right?
Gluten.
Yeah.
Big Difference.

2937
02:46:44.150 --> 02:46:46.880
Huge difference.
It's funny.
That's a touchy thing with people.

2938
02:46:46.881 --> 02:46:48.410
A lot of people were calling bullshit on that,

2939
02:46:48.590 --> 02:46:51.410
but there's some real science to people having a problem with men.

2940
02:46:51.500 --> 02:46:55.880
And the other thing is is like,
uh,
like friends asked me to go out and do stuff.

2941
02:46:55.881 --> 02:46:59.690
I won't do it like a Thursday night.
They're like,
oh,
let's go see a movie now.

2942
02:46:59.691 --> 02:47:03.100
I'm cool man.
I'm in,
I'm in bed by 10 every night.
Uh,

2943
02:47:03.200 --> 02:47:04.310
just kind of have to be right.

2944
02:47:04.640 --> 02:47:07.760
You have to be like super diligent about that kind of shit.
I have to be,

2945
02:47:07.761 --> 02:47:11.450
if I do anything less than I'll question myself on in the octagon you put

2946
02:47:11.451 --> 02:47:14.840
together your whole schedule as far as like what you do during the week?
No,

2947
02:47:14.841 --> 02:47:18.620
I have a coach Tony Jeffries who looks over the schedule and puts their thing

2948
02:47:18.621 --> 02:47:21.350
together.
Like I've already sparred twice this week,

2949
02:47:21.351 --> 02:47:26.130
but it just so happens this bad ass guy is in town and he,

2950
02:47:26.930 --> 02:47:31.080
he's a very,
it's great sparring.
He happens to be another heavyweight.
So we're,

2951
02:47:31.081 --> 02:47:34.100
we're going tomorrow and that was the,
I just found that out before I came here.

2952
02:47:34.340 --> 02:47:38.720
He's like,
Yo,
you're supposed to go wrestle and do Jitsu.
Not Anymore.

2953
02:47:38.750 --> 02:47:40.490
You're sparring five rounds with this monster.

2954
02:47:40.700 --> 02:47:45.110
What about like I'm on the track conditioning.
Okay.
Conditions another level.

2955
02:47:45.260 --> 02:47:46.740
So like,
uh,
I had,

2956
02:47:46.880 --> 02:47:50.180
I had strengthened condition today where it's kind of like implementing flat

2957
02:47:50.181 --> 02:47:51.410
three,
five minute rounds,

2958
02:47:51.440 --> 02:47:55.010
like circuit training and then tomorrow spar five rounds and then I'll go to the

2959
02:47:55.011 --> 02:47:56.410
track and they,
they,

2960
02:47:56.420 --> 02:48:00.170
they gave me a heart rate monitor and have to run these eight hundreds and then

2961
02:48:00.171 --> 02:48:02.540
as soon as my heart rate gets to one 40 I run them again.

2962
02:48:02.890 --> 02:48:07.520
And it's cool because by the,
by June 14th,
that week of I'll run.

2963
02:48:07.521 --> 02:48:11.210
It's crazy how fast they recover.
That's cool to see,
man.
That's interesting.

2964
02:48:11.211 --> 02:48:14.420
Do you wear one of those runs are in your chest?
I want to go to the best ones.

2965
02:48:14.421 --> 02:48:16.710
Right.
What are those four heart rate monitors?
Heart rate.

2966
02:48:16.730 --> 02:48:19.520
And those are the best ones,
right?
The ones and the rest,
they don't quite do it,

2967
02:48:19.550 --> 02:48:23.430
right?
Yeah,
they don't do it.
It,
it's,
I think it's called a Garmin.
You,

2968
02:48:23.431 --> 02:48:25.440
you're in around your chest and then you have the watch.

2969
02:48:25.441 --> 02:48:28.730
So when I run I can see it.
I coach is just like,
tell me what,

2970
02:48:28.731 --> 02:48:30.050
what's your heart rate at he,

2971
02:48:30.080 --> 02:48:33.550
they record everything and we'll say one 78 and then he'll like soon he gets to

2972
02:48:33.551 --> 02:48:35.660
one 40 you're going,
it's all about recovering,

2973
02:48:35.900 --> 02:48:40.190
about increasing the amount of time that you could run before you,
you know,

2974
02:48:40.191 --> 02:48:43.190
you hit a certain level and then once you hit that certain level,

2975
02:48:43.370 --> 02:48:47.300
dropping back and cutting the amount of recovery down as much as possible.

2976
02:48:47.301 --> 02:48:50.750
So if during the first week it takes you a minute and a half to recover,

2977
02:48:50.870 --> 02:48:54.050
that's what it is.
But by the six week it should be like 20 seconds.
It's cool.

2978
02:48:54.051 --> 02:48:58.190
It's cool to see,
you know,
like it gives you a definitive,
like you know,

2979
02:48:58.191 --> 02:49:03.191
you're in shape and what's cool is my coach is so on it that from last camp we

2980
02:49:04.011 --> 02:49:08.010
looked at when I first started camp for Mitch Reone,
what I ran my eight 604

2981
02:49:08.010 --> 02:49:10.560
<v 4>hundreds in my recovery time compared to now.</v>

2982
02:49:10.710 --> 02:49:14.200
And I'm already a step ahead of the game to run like a,

2983
02:49:14.340 --> 02:49:15.850
is there a day where you run like I dunno,

2984
02:49:15.870 --> 02:49:20.010
eight miles or something or is it mostly I liked to run long distance.

2985
02:49:20.011 --> 02:49:23.870
I love rock.
It's weird.
I love running long distance high.
Right.
I'll,

2986
02:49:23.871 --> 02:49:27.570
I'll just run for four miles and it's no thing,
but they have to cut back on.

2987
02:49:27.571 --> 02:49:31.800
It gets hard on your joints.
I'll run those 800 from my coach on the beach.

2988
02:49:32.010 --> 02:49:34.980
The beach.
I was going to ask you,
I'll do the beach.
Beach and dunes.

2989
02:49:34.981 --> 02:49:38.940
Dunes are great right off the dunes off PCH or some because you don't take the

2990
02:49:38.941 --> 02:49:42.660
pounding the,
exactly.
I see people running on the sidewalk and I just go,

2991
02:49:42.661 --> 02:49:47.070
God damn.
Do you not have anybody that you talked to tough on your body.

2992
02:49:47.070 --> 02:49:50.570
What about,
what about um,
uh,
biking and stuff?
Is that,

2993
02:49:50.580 --> 02:49:54.520
is that low impact or you sure,
yeah,
very low impact.
Low impact,

2994
02:49:54.521 --> 02:49:57.860
but you have to go such a far distance to get a good workout out of it.
Yeah.

2995
02:49:57.870 --> 02:50:01.080
Unless you're doing him.
Nothing really substitutes for running,
does it?

2996
02:50:01.081 --> 02:50:04.440
I mean you go swimming swimming's good too,
but that's also tough.

2997
02:50:04.800 --> 02:50:08.550
You can do a serious workout on a lot of different machines depending on the

2998
02:50:08.551 --> 02:50:12.080
intensity that you put out.
A spin bike to whoop your ass.
Fuck yeah.

2999
02:50:12.081 --> 02:50:16.050
If you have a good one,
if you have a good [inaudible] signs are beasts,

3000
02:50:16.140 --> 02:50:17.550
but for me,
limiting me,
I,

3001
02:50:18.480 --> 02:50:22.630
I think one of the purest forms of shown if someone's athletic is a sprint,
oh,

3002
02:50:22.680 --> 02:50:26.520
they're running form.
So for me it's just in my blood.
I,

3003
02:50:26.980 --> 02:50:29.230
I know if,
if I'm sprinting,
I'm running,

3004
02:50:29.240 --> 02:50:32.160
it just makes me know that I'm doing the right thing.
For other guys,

3005
02:50:32.161 --> 02:50:34.410
it doesn't make sense for other heavyweights they probably shouldn't do.

3006
02:50:34.411 --> 02:50:37.320
It's hard on their knees.
For me,
I have to do it.
It's not,

3007
02:50:37.321 --> 02:50:40.650
I don't have any injuries,
knock on wood,
nothing.
I've been running all my life.

3008
02:50:40.651 --> 02:50:43.650
I just said that's probably why you don't have the interest.

3009
02:50:43.651 --> 02:50:46.320
Cause he'd been running all your life and the human body is an amazing ability

3010
02:50:46.321 --> 02:50:49.370
to adapt to whatever you needed to do.
Yeah.
I think you were talking about,

3011
02:50:49.380 --> 02:50:51.170
that's how you're one of the people that has,

3012
02:50:51.240 --> 02:50:55.800
you don't get people get injured because they put a lot of weight on af in

3013
02:50:55.801 --> 02:50:59.430
between fights and they come back to training.
That's when you get injured.

3014
02:50:59.490 --> 02:51:02.370
You stand shotty,
they jump into camp and the body's like,

3015
02:51:02.371 --> 02:51:05.490
what the hell are we doing?
They blow out like their needs out of time.

3016
02:51:05.760 --> 02:51:09.080
We're three hours in there it is.
Sorry.
Do it again.
Thank you guys.

3017
02:51:09.090 --> 02:51:12.510
Easy talking to you guys.
And I just fucking flew by.
Um,

3018
02:51:12.511 --> 02:51:15.270
so I think we kind of talked about the UFC

3019
02:51:17.390 --> 02:51:22.070
is a post UFC fight.
Why keep showing the flying knee?

3020
02:51:22.680 --> 02:51:27.010
Great fight.
Yeah,
we talked about pretty much the entire a UFC,
right?

3021
02:51:27.060 --> 02:51:30.190
Other than a couple of the prelim fights.
But um,

3022
02:51:30.450 --> 02:51:33.900
well when are we going to see you guys again when we do this again?

3023
02:51:33.980 --> 02:51:37.780
Anytime you want,
you want to do the thing with Eric Silva and Matt Brown.

3024
02:51:37.920 --> 02:51:40.470
That'd be dope.
I'd love to see we find that.
I'd love to do it.

3025
02:51:40.530 --> 02:51:42.930
And that would be like the most disjointed podcast ever.

3026
02:51:42.931 --> 02:51:45.560
So for anybody listening in,
you're going to have to walk.

3027
02:51:45.570 --> 02:51:49.280
This is the companion podcast.
You have to be a real,
real fan of the,

3028
02:51:49.500 --> 02:51:52.050
you have to watch it at the fights.
Otherwise,

3029
02:51:53.130 --> 02:51:55.230
I'm going to say that at the beginning.
I want to say skip over this.

3030
02:51:55.231 --> 02:51:58.500
If you look at for it'll be or it'll be our fighter and the kid for that week.

3031
02:52:00.630 --> 02:52:02.880
