<v Speaker 1>That's what they said.</v>

293
00:09:54.871 --> 00:09:56.850

<v Speaker 1>after like three days,</v>

294
00:09:56.851 --> 00:09:59.040

<v Speaker 1>I've heard that,</v>

298
00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:07.140
<v Speaker 1>that phrase.</v>

299
00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:10.140
<v Speaker 1>But what is the exact medical thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's going on?</v>

300
00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:11.940
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for guidance had to.</v>

301
00:10:11.941 --> 00:10:13.220
<v Speaker 1>I should know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

302
00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:14.333
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's just like basically when </v>

303
00:10:16.111 --> 00:10:19.210
<v Speaker 1>your heart's not getting enough oxygen </v>
<v Speaker 1>or something or um,</v>

304
00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:21.580
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just not functioning properly.</v>

305
00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:23.500
<v Speaker 1>Usually there's like a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

306
00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:24.393
<v Speaker 1>there's like a blocked artery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something and I think like coke </v>

307
00:10:27.721 --> 00:10:29.670
<v Speaker 1>is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a vasoconstrictor,</v>

308
00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:31.900
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so maybe like constricted my veins.</v>

309
00:10:31.901 --> 00:10:34.830
<v Speaker 1>So there wasn't like an Agra visal </v>
<v Speaker 1>dilator,</v>

310
00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:37.240
<v Speaker 1>so does shouldn't have bounce it out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I don't really know the science behind </v>

313
00:10:40.381 --> 00:10:41.214
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I know that like coke and wag or I </v>

314
00:10:42.241 --> 00:10:43.710
<v Speaker 1>don't think you're supposed to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>some.</v>

317
00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:50.910
