<v Speaker 1>It comes with Lou and I guess it's modeled after her.</v>

44
00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:50.190

60
00:02:12.061 --> 00:02:13.020
<v Speaker 1>What got him fired?</v>

61
00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.870
<v Speaker 1>None of it had to do with him fucking somebody.</v>

62
00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:17.213
<v Speaker 1>He definitely,</v>

63
00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:18.510
<v Speaker 1>someone's skeptical.</v>

64
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.530
<v Speaker 1>I'm skeptical that he did that.</v>

65
00:02:20.531 --> 00:02:24.640
<v Speaker 1>He just sent pictures of his direct cock and underwear and nothing else.</v>

66
00:02:24.641 --> 00:02:25.320
<v Speaker 1>It's the end.</v>

67
00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:26.250
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's got their thing.</v>

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.961
<v Speaker 1>Did we ever dated a girl?</v>

69
00:02:27.961 --> 00:02:28.760
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't anyone have sex?</v>

70
00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.080
<v Speaker 1>Just wants to blow you now.</v>

71
00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.050
<v Speaker 1>Now you've never dated a girl who only wants to give blowjobs.</v>

72
00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:39.390
<v Speaker 1>I would hate that girl.</v>

73
00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.280
<v Speaker 1>I know a few friends that have had that girl.</v>

74
00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:42.001
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:52.740
<v Speaker 1>She just doesn't like it.</v>

82
00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.850
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's because or posts you sort of eaten up awards.</v>

130
00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:02.703
<v Speaker 1>I'll ask the question.</v>

131
00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:03.280
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>

<v Speaker 1>want to learn how to fly or quite with a bolster your key other than that.</v>

134
00:04:09.581 --> 00:04:09.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

135
00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:10.480

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:12.160
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't really work.</v>

139
00:04:12.161 --> 00:04:12.880
<v Speaker 1>And if it did,</v>

140
00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.660
<v Speaker 1>people would be training in Kung Fu when they stepped into the after guy.</v>

141
00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:16.930
<v Speaker 1>A lot of guys go well,</v>

142
00:04:16.931 --> 00:04:17.980
<v Speaker 1>but in real life,</v>

143
00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:19.200

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

145
00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:21.460

149
00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.240
<v Speaker 1>as a sports situation,</v>

150
00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:28.780
<v Speaker 1>the best stuff works on trained killers and the trained killers are the guys</v>

151
00:04:28.781 --> 00:04:31.700
<v Speaker 1>like mayhem did Martha Vega,</v>

152
00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:33.380
<v Speaker 1>there is one guy I know who,</v>

<v Speaker 1>he's a knife fighter.</v>

158
00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:41.300
<v Speaker 1>Like Katie teaches knife fighting like on a high level and he goes,</v>

159
00:04:41.301 --> 00:04:42.070
<v Speaker 1>he goes up.</v>

161
00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.961
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

162
00:04:44.961 --> 00:04:46.420
<v Speaker 1>Do you need to understand ground funding?</v>

163
00:04:46.421 --> 00:04:47.091
<v Speaker 1>Do you see what I'm saying?</v>

164
00:04:47.091 --> 00:04:47.691
<v Speaker 1>Kicking and punching.</v>

165
00:04:47.691 --> 00:04:48.021
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

166
00:04:48.021 --> 00:04:48.621
<v Speaker 1>and he knows it all.</v>

167
00:04:48.621 --> 00:04:49.190
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

168
00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:49.431
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>

169
00:04:49.431 --> 00:04:50.264

172
00:04:52.191 --> 00:04:54.260
<v Speaker 1>he was like this and it was a little hook thing like that.</v>

173
00:04:54.261 --> 00:04:54.531
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I can actually scribe your spine from the front,</v>

176
00:04:58.971 --> 00:05:00.110
<v Speaker 1>from the front.</v>

177
00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.920
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

178
00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:02.180

184
00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:09.111
<v Speaker 1>Then he goes this to me,</v>

00:05:09.111 --> 00:05:09.620
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>

00:05:28.041 --> 00:05:28.874
<v Speaker 1>This is terribly goes.</v>

206
00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

207
00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:30.560
<v Speaker 1>that's real fighting this way.</v>

208
00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:30.890
<v Speaker 1>He told me,</v>

209
00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:31.131
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

210
00:05:31.131 --> 00:05:32.690
<v Speaker 1>he's got this little hook thing and he goes like this.</v>

211
00:05:32.691 --> 00:05:33.110
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

212
00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:35.180
<v Speaker 1>see if I'm standing here like that and you don't see you just,</v>

213
00:05:35.181 --> 00:05:35.320
<v Speaker 1>you'd,</v>

214
00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:36.110
<v Speaker 1>it looks like a,</v>

215
00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:36.891
<v Speaker 1>I'm just holding things.</v>

216
00:05:36.891 --> 00:05:37.440
<v Speaker 1>It looks like a,</v>

217
00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:38.600
<v Speaker 1>like a key holder.</v>

218
00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:40.880
<v Speaker 1>But if I come under here and pull this,</v>

219
00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:42.020
<v Speaker 1>then your whole life,</v>

220
00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:48.560
<v Speaker 2>someone screaming.</v>

221
00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:48.801
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

222
00:05:48.801 --> 00:05:49.634
<v Speaker 2>that's weird.</v>

223
00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:52.203
<v Speaker 2>Stop filming.</v>

224
00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.730
<v Speaker 1>Turns out those kids screaming was just kids playing,</v>

225
00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:59.090
<v Speaker 1>which is always good.</v>

226
00:05:59.120 --> 00:05:59.960
<v Speaker 1>It's always good to be wrong.</v>

227
00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:02.960
<v Speaker 1>Brian Killen was awesome on the podcast and uh,</v>

228
00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.150
<v Speaker 1>since we didn't really end to end his interview,</v>

229
00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:06.313
<v Speaker 1>we'll do it this way.</v>

230
00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:09.240
<v Speaker 1>Powerful Thomas girl,</v>

231
00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:09.890
<v Speaker 1>ladies and gentleman,</v>

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:12.531
<v Speaker 1>next week.</v>

234
00:06:12.531 --> 00:06:14.360
<v Speaker 1>I start back on fear factor again.</v>

235
00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:15.470
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

236
00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:16.400
<v Speaker 1>That's ridiculous.</v>

237
00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:17.990
<v Speaker 1>I can't even believe I agreed to do that.</v>

238
00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm like a goddamn raccoon young,</v>

239
00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:21.800
<v Speaker 1>something shining in front of my face.</v>

240
00:06:21.801 --> 00:06:22.131
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

241
00:06:22.131 --> 00:06:22.541
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

242
00:06:22.541 --> 00:06:23.390
<v Speaker 1>it's shiny.</v>

243
00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:25.820
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be eating.</v>

244
00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:26.653
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>

245
00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:32.060
<v Speaker 1>I'm Joe Rogan and this is fear factor and the stunts are about to see where all</v>

246
00:06:32.061 --> 00:06:34.400
<v Speaker 1>design that supervised by trained professionals.</v>

247
00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:38.240
<v Speaker 1>They are extremely dangerous and should not be attempted by anyone anywhere.</v>

248
00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:43.330
<v Speaker 1>Anytime I remembered that and then under any circumstances don't add shit</v>

249
00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:43.960
<v Speaker 1>to me.</v>

250
00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:48.960
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] I said [inaudible] want anywhere,</v>

251
00:06:49.041 --> 00:06:49.720
<v Speaker 1>anytime.</v>

252
00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:53.690
<v Speaker 1>That is any circumstances you critique is like</v>

253
00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:56.223
<v Speaker 1>what about this shit?</v>

254
00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:00.730
<v Speaker 1>And then I have to say evidently fear is not a factor for you.</v>

255
00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:03.080
<v Speaker 1>Everything else is free ball.</v>

256
00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:05.870
<v Speaker 1>You're going to get that back now people are going to come and say that to you</v>

257
00:07:05.871 --> 00:07:06.261
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

258
00:07:06.261 --> 00:07:07.094
<v Speaker 1>Now</v>

259
00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:09.681
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

260
00:07:09.681 --> 00:07:13.610
<v Speaker 1>I've gone back to my post fear factor days where everyone would get,</v>

261
00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:13.881
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

262
00:07:13.881 --> 00:07:18.080
<v Speaker 1>my boy wants needs more and that's like your how many times have you heard</v>

263
00:07:18.081 --> 00:07:18.914
<v Speaker 1>people say that?</v>

264
00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:19.690
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

265
00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:24.280
<v Speaker 1>it's the [inaudible] as well.</v>

266
00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:27.350
<v Speaker 1>It's going to make comedy a little more interesting.</v>

267
00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:30.320
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be old heckles that are new again,</v>

268
00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:30.861
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

269
00:07:30.861 --> 00:07:31.694
<v Speaker 1>Because it's</v>

270
00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:34.540
<v Speaker 1>already got that shit right.</v>

271
00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:35.583
<v Speaker 1>I'm already,</v>

272
00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:36.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm already ready.</v>

273
00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:37.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm ready.</v>

274
00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:37.870
<v Speaker 1>Ready?</v>

275
00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:38.310
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

276
00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:38.990
<v Speaker 1>I hope not,</v>

277
00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:39.860
<v Speaker 1>but it probably will,</v>

278
00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:41.030
<v Speaker 1>but I think it will survive.</v>

279
00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:45.380
<v Speaker 1>The good thing about the podcast is the podcast fans buy out the tickets before</v>

280
00:07:45.381 --> 00:07:46.520
<v Speaker 1>the retards have a shot at it.</v>

281
00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:47.240
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

282
00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:49.630
<v Speaker 1>so that's what it's going to keep them out of.</v>

<v Speaker 1>This might be the most boring fucking post podcasts interview we've ever done.</v>

296
00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:22.340
<v Speaker 1>This no fucking continuity to any of the things we're saying where there's no</v>

297
00:08:22.341 --> 00:08:25.160
<v Speaker 1>energy behind it when I have a lot to offer you today,</v>

298
00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:26.000
<v Speaker 1>but look,</v>

299
00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.830
<v Speaker 1>there's cycles good and bad.</v>

300
00:08:27.831 --> 00:08:28.850
<v Speaker 1>There's pro and con.</v>

301
00:08:28.851 --> 00:08:29.990
<v Speaker 1>There's ebbs and flows.</v>

302
00:08:29.991 --> 00:08:31.310
<v Speaker 1>The wave it comes in,</v>

303
00:08:31.311 --> 00:08:32.150
<v Speaker 1>it goes out.</v>

304
00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:34.213
<v Speaker 1>Can I,</v>

305

<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

306
00:08:35.151 --> 00:08:37.070
<v Speaker 1>this is the wrap up of the podcast.</v>

307
00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:41.120
<v Speaker 1>We had a very fascinating podcast with Giorgio from ancient aliens and of course</v>

<v Speaker 1>I just want them to talk</v>

315
00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:55.450

<v Speaker 1>I got to do this podcast with you.</v>

317
00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:57.990
<v Speaker 1>I got to do this podcast with you.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I've got,</v>

319
00:08:58.500 --> 00:08:59.333
<v Speaker 1>I've got to see this guy.</v>

320
00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:00.630
<v Speaker 1>I got the questions for this guy,</v>

321
00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:01.920
<v Speaker 1>but Nazis and aliens.</v>

322
00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:05.160
<v Speaker 1>A lot of questions.</v>

323
00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:07.880
<v Speaker 1>That was a good time is the first podcast here we gun.</v>

324
00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:08.761
<v Speaker 1>Are you going to what?</v>

325
00:09:08.761 --> 00:09:10.050
<v Speaker 1>Let's just do this like this.</v>

326
00:09:10.051 --> 00:09:10.800
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

327
00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.150
<v Speaker 1>But I've done a lot of over the phone</v>

328
00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:18.270
<v Speaker 1>tweet that I'll read to it.</v>

329
00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:19.530
<v Speaker 1>You've done a lot over the phone.</v>

330
00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:20.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

331
00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.250
<v Speaker 1>This is definitely more interesting picture of US intimately,</v>

332
00:09:23.251 --> 00:09:24.084
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

333
00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:25.613
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

334
00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:29.540
<v Speaker 1>So this is the first time I've ever done a podcast like this.</v>

335
00:09:29.541 --> 00:09:30.680
<v Speaker 1>We'd get to go deep,</v>

336
00:09:30.681 --> 00:09:30.951
<v Speaker 1>deep,</v>

337
00:09:30.951 --> 00:09:32.330
<v Speaker 1>deep into the crazy Ben.</v>

338
00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:32.841
<v Speaker 1>Cause he,</v>

339
00:09:32.841 --> 00:09:33.281
<v Speaker 1>I told you,</v>

340
00:09:33.281 --> 00:09:35.730
<v Speaker 1>you broke my crazy meter with the ark of the Covenant Day.</v>

341
00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:36.663
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>

342
00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:37.780
<v Speaker 1>It's never happened before.</v>

343
00:09:37.781 --> 00:09:40.180
<v Speaker 1>I think that like,</v>

344
00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:40.401
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

345

<v Speaker 1>the fuck is he saying?</v>

346
00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:44.250
<v Speaker 1>He's saying it was a fucking vending machine.</v>

347
00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:45.353
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

348
00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:46.830
<v Speaker 1>An extraterrestrial one.</v>

349
00:09:46.831 --> 00:09:47.664
<v Speaker 1>None of us.</v>

350
00:09:48.130 --> 00:09:49.140
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty crazy stuff,</v>

351
00:09:49.141 --> 00:09:49.560
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

352
00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:54.560
<v Speaker 1>What is it like living in your world is overwhelmed by all this speculation and</v>

353
00:09:57.841 --> 00:10:01.620
<v Speaker 1>crazy stuff and things that most people will never take seriously,</v>

354
00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:02.460
<v Speaker 1>but yet you're,</v>

355
00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:05.290
<v Speaker 1>you've spent on incredible amount of time invested in all these things.</v>

356
00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:06.550
<v Speaker 1>What does that like man?</v>

357
00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:07.571
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:13.080
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

366
00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:14.110
<v Speaker 1>I rarely,</v>

367
00:10:14.111 --> 00:10:16.630
<v Speaker 1>I rarely go to conferences because,</v>

368
00:10:16.631 --> 00:10:20.710
<v Speaker 1>because there's so much weird stuff going on as it's even weird for me,</v>

369
00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:22.060
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>

372
00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:24.040
<v Speaker 1>and that's the thing that,</v>

373
00:10:24.041 --> 00:10:24.401
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

374

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

382
00:10:33.101 --> 00:10:35.800
<v Speaker 1>slow it down a second here because this is,</v>

383
00:10:35.801 --> 00:10:38.170
<v Speaker 1>how are you going to lose the mainstream?</v>

384
00:10:38.590 --> 00:10:43.030
<v Speaker 1>Because just to talk about the potential or the possibility at ets,</v>

385
00:10:43.031 --> 00:10:43.780
<v Speaker 1>where here,</v>

386

<v Speaker 1>that's fucking enough.</v>

388
00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:46.113
<v Speaker 1>That's enough.</v>

389
00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:46.800
<v Speaker 1>That's enough.</v>

390

<v Speaker 1>You know and so,</v>

391

00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:55.660
<v Speaker 1>What about [inaudible] possible?</v>

393
00:10:58.670 --> 00:11:01.430
<v Speaker 1>You can't even put a dollar billing between the fittings</v>

394
00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:04.183
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

395
00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:08.790
<v Speaker 1>Freddy Loc hard and I was just talking about keeping the pimp hand strong.</v>

396
00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:11.930
<v Speaker 1>He was just telling me how it keeps a pimp hand strong and I got admitted some</v>

397
00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:12.900
<v Speaker 1>high level shit.</v>

398
00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:14.280
<v Speaker 1>He knows what the fuck he's doing done.</v>

399
00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:15.050
<v Speaker 1>It's done.</v>

400
00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:15.640
<v Speaker 1>It's done.</v>

401
00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:17.160
<v Speaker 1>It's a man who's grown up with it.</v>

402
00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:17.460
<v Speaker 1>Did,</v>

403
00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:18.870
<v Speaker 1>did your dad have a strong compound?</v>

404
00:11:18.871 --> 00:11:19.471
<v Speaker 1>Extremely.</v>

405
00:11:19.471 --> 00:11:20.370
<v Speaker 1>It's still strong.</v>

406
00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:21.540
<v Speaker 1>It works on me still.</v>

407
00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:22.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

408
00:11:22.050 --> 00:11:22.841
<v Speaker 1>So you could tell him,</v>

409
00:11:22.841 --> 00:11:23.041
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

410
00:11:23.041 --> 00:11:27.150
<v Speaker 1>you understand the psychology behind the pimp hand strong.</v>

411
00:11:27.151 --> 00:11:27.990
<v Speaker 1>You need to let you know.</v>

412
00:11:27.991 --> 00:11:30.540
<v Speaker 1>If you don't use the pen pen then things get out of control and you can take an</v>

413
00:11:30.541 --> 00:11:32.460
<v Speaker 1>advantage of the dazzling.</v>

414
00:11:32.461 --> 00:11:33.130
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>

415
00:11:33.130 --> 00:11:35.860
<v Speaker 1>You got to realize that nature in this life.</v>

416
00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:40.950
<v Speaker 1>And women want men and men want women and occasionally a woman wants to be a man</v>

417
00:11:41.321 --> 00:11:43.510
<v Speaker 1>and a man wants to be a woman and that's a catastrophe.</v>

418
00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:48.580
<v Speaker 1>And what a woman wants to be a man and you're a man you usually submit because</v>

419
00:11:48.581 --> 00:11:50.320
<v Speaker 1>she has the pussy and then you know what I'm in anymore.</v>

420
00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:51.183
<v Speaker 1>She's the math.</v>

421
00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:54.730
<v Speaker 1>When someone's telling you what to do with that person to the your man,</v>

422
00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:58.000
<v Speaker 1>at least how your man a little pussy and some companionship,</v>

423
00:11:58.660 --> 00:11:59.201
<v Speaker 1>the only sound,</v>

424
00:11:59.201 --> 00:12:00.340
<v Speaker 1>anything that's your happiness,</v>

425
00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:02.380
<v Speaker 1>not your man that don't rely on anybody for anything ever.</v>

426
00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:04.210
<v Speaker 1>That's how public service messages of the day.</v>

427
00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:05.530
<v Speaker 1>Now that I'm back on NBC,</v>

428
00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:05.891
<v Speaker 1>the whole,</v>

00:12:05.891 --> 00:12:06.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

430
00:12:06.390 --> 00:12:10.300
<v Speaker 1>keeps a pimp hand strong the more you know like rainbows and shit.</v>

431
00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:11.480
<v Speaker 1>My pants ready.</v>

432

454
00:12:40.101 --> 00:12:41.020

460
00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:46.641
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

461
00:12:46.641 --> 00:12:47.800
<v Speaker 1>you don't even do guests yet.</v>

462
00:12:47.801 --> 00:12:50.890
<v Speaker 1>Right now you're just like interacting with people on Twitter and shit on</v>

463
00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:51.380
<v Speaker 1>finding it.</v>

464
00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:53.900
<v Speaker 1>We're finding the voice and then I think I might start playing my own guests.</v>

465
00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:54.641
<v Speaker 1>Maybe dude,</v>

466
00:12:54.641 --> 00:12:55.474
<v Speaker 1>go back.</v>

467
00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:57.970
<v Speaker 1>When we were doing our first podcast,</v>

468
00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.770
<v Speaker 1>Brian and I started over a year ago,</v>

469
00:12:59.771 --> 00:13:00.430
<v Speaker 1>year and a half ago.</v>

470
00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:01.270
<v Speaker 1>It was terrible.</v>

471
00:13:01.271 --> 00:13:02.110
<v Speaker 1>We were awful.</v>

472
00:13:02.290 --> 00:13:06.340
<v Speaker 1>The first couple of podcasts are unwatchable snowflakes and we'll like reading</v>

473
00:13:06.341 --> 00:13:06.851
<v Speaker 1>off Twitter.</v>

474
00:13:06.851 --> 00:13:07.684
<v Speaker 1>What is he saying?</v>

475
00:13:07.830 --> 00:13:08.663
<v Speaker 1>What is wrong with this guy?</v>

476
00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:09.091
<v Speaker 1>We're like,</v>

477
00:13:09.091 --> 00:13:10.900
<v Speaker 1>it was like so dumb and boring.</v>

478
00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:11.111
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

479
00:13:11.111 --> 00:13:11.891
<v Speaker 1>He let me know the first,</v>

480
00:13:11.891 --> 00:13:12.380
<v Speaker 1>the second one,</v>

481
00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:13.330
<v Speaker 1>cause I snuck in and Twitter.</v>

482
00:13:13.331 --> 00:13:16.570
<v Speaker 1>So much as if you're listening to this on your iPod a couple of days later,</v>

483
00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:18.100
<v Speaker 1>this is not exciting.</v>

484
00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:19.121
<v Speaker 1>So I was like,</v>

485
00:13:19.121 --> 00:13:19.271
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

486
00:13:19.271 --> 00:13:19.481
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

487
00:13:19.481 --> 00:13:20.314
<v Speaker 1>I'll leave to,</v>

488
00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:20.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

489
00:13:20.650 --> 00:13:21.483
<v Speaker 1>you've got to leave.</v>

490
00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:23.380
<v Speaker 1>I think the third time we just did it more relaxed.</v>

491
00:13:23.381 --> 00:13:25.690
<v Speaker 1>The second time it was almost like it's a radio show going to be professional.</v>

492
00:13:25.691 --> 00:13:26.471
<v Speaker 1>But then the third time it's like,</v>

493
00:13:26.471 --> 00:13:26.711
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

494
00:13:26.711 --> 00:13:30.040
<v Speaker 1>just shoot the shit and see where we had one mistake that we did where we let</v>

495
00:13:30.041 --> 00:13:30.940
<v Speaker 1>people in the chat room,</v>

496
00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:34.860
<v Speaker 1>we let a chat room rather than we like read the chat room and it's also like</v>

497
00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:35.500
<v Speaker 1>nigger,</v>

498
00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:37.350
<v Speaker 1>nigger kind craziness.</v>

499
00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:38.021
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you fucking,</v>

500
00:13:38.021 --> 00:13:41.620
<v Speaker 1>we'd have to ban this guy and this guy would be spam and show me your cock.</v>

501
00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:43.600
<v Speaker 1>Oh are so crazy.</v>

502
00:13:43.601 --> 00:13:44.020
<v Speaker 1>They just,</v>

503
00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:45.400
<v Speaker 1>they just want you to acknowledge them.</v>

504
00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:46.680
<v Speaker 1>They want their name to be said.</v>

505
00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:47.270
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

506
00:13:47.270 --> 00:13:48.220
<v Speaker 1>So we had to figure it out.</v>

507
00:13:48.221 --> 00:13:50.950
<v Speaker 1>We had to figure out that you can't talk to them and you're just going to kind</v>

508
00:13:50.951 --> 00:13:53.710
<v Speaker 1>of do your own thing and you got to listen to feedback.</v>

509
00:13:53.711 --> 00:13:55.030
<v Speaker 1>You learn from some feedback,</v>

510
00:13:55.210 --> 00:13:56.200
<v Speaker 1>but you gotta you know,</v>

511
00:13:56.201 --> 00:13:59.690
<v Speaker 1>you also got to like insulate some people for having an impact on the show.</v>

512
00:13:59.760 --> 00:13:59.930
<v Speaker 1>Nah,</v>

513
00:13:59.930 --> 00:14:02.040
<v Speaker 1>there's no part of it.</v>

514
00:14:02.041 --> 00:14:03.820
<v Speaker 1>That's the only God damn crazy.</v>

515
00:14:04.570 --> 00:14:05.800
<v Speaker 1>It's so fascinating.</v>

516
00:14:06.070 --> 00:14:07.810
<v Speaker 1>There's so many nutty fucking people out there.</v>

517
00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:08.800
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

518
00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:10.270
<v Speaker 1>when you have a podcast,</v>

519
00:14:10.271 --> 00:14:11.830
<v Speaker 1>you could bring those nutty people together.</v>

520
00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:12.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

521
00:14:12.970 --> 00:14:14.170
<v Speaker 1>The death squad label,</v>

522
00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:16.420
<v Speaker 1>I ran into a guy in San Diego of his lesson.</v>

523
00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:17.650
<v Speaker 1>He was telling me everything about it.</v>

524
00:14:17.651 --> 00:14:19.230
<v Speaker 1>Should I forgot about this?</v>

525
00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:20.410
<v Speaker 1>The first one we did.</v>

526
00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:20.801
<v Speaker 1>Oh Man.</v>

531
00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:27.970
<v Speaker 1>some shit during the day while you're doing things.</v>

532
00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:28.560
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

533
00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:32.070

537
00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:37.050
<v Speaker 1>Went to a bar and in the inside the barn,</v>

538
00:14:37.051 --> 00:14:38.050

<v Speaker 1>He changed his name and you can see the whole story or listened to it or</v>

557
00:15:05.001 --> 00:15:05.834

00:15:10.041 --> 00:15:10.701
<v Speaker 1>If you read about it,</v>

564
00:15:10.701 --> 00:15:11.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm warrior poet,</v>

565

<v Speaker 1>a u s there you go read about it and you can watch his videos on it and uh,</v>

566
00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:17.360
<v Speaker 1>it's not for kids.</v>

567
00:15:17.510 --> 00:15:20.300
<v Speaker 1>This is some real shit folks right out.</v>

568
00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:23.290
<v Speaker 1>We just got started doing the podcast and uh,</v>

569
00:15:23.390 --> 00:15:28.010
<v Speaker 1>I think what I told him was that I think it was the best depiction of the</v>

570
00:15:28.011 --> 00:15:29.930
<v Speaker 1>Iowasca experience that I had ever heard.</v>

571
00:15:29.931 --> 00:15:30.860
<v Speaker 1>The most detailed,</v>

572
00:15:30.861 --> 00:15:31.880
<v Speaker 1>the most compelling,</v>

573
00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:33.260
<v Speaker 1>the best story.</v>

574
00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:35.680
<v Speaker 1>It was really,</v>

575
00:15:35.710 --> 00:15:38.270
<v Speaker 1>you went in depth and you,</v>

576
00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:41.050
<v Speaker 1>you did it without any worry about how ridiculous the sounds.</v>

577
00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:43.100
<v Speaker 1>He didn't apologize for any of it.</v>

578
00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:43.611
<v Speaker 1>You just,</v>

579
00:15:43.611 --> 00:15:44.630
<v Speaker 1>you just jumped in there.</v>

580
00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:47.040
<v Speaker 1>It's easy when you're just telling what happened.</v>

581
00:15:47.070 --> 00:15:47.701
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

582
00:15:47.701 --> 00:15:48.780
<v Speaker 1>It's like I didn't have to.</v>

583
00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:49.261
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>

584
00:15:49.261 --> 00:15:49.980
<v Speaker 1>but it's not,</v>

585
00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:50.460
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

586
00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:50.641
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

587
00:15:50.641 --> 00:15:51.510
<v Speaker 1>maybe not how you do it,</v>

588
00:15:51.511 --> 00:15:52.470
<v Speaker 1>but it's so,</v>

589
00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:52.801
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

590
00:15:52.801 --> 00:15:54.690
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have to make anything up.</v>

591
00:15:55.770 --> 00:15:57.390
<v Speaker 1>That's what happened to me out there.</v>

592
00:15:57.391 --> 00:15:59.760
<v Speaker 1>So it sounds like complete utter horse shit.</v>

593
00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:01.410
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

594
00:16:01.410 --> 00:16:01.920
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

595
00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:04.710
<v Speaker 1>It's just because it's too crazy for our reality.</v>

596
00:16:04.711 --> 00:16:05.820
<v Speaker 1>It's too crazy for our reality.</v>

597
00:16:05.821 --> 00:16:08.760
<v Speaker 1>But that was the beauty of the way you told it is that even though it sounds</v>

598
00:16:08.761 --> 00:16:10.710
<v Speaker 1>like complete other wish it like on paper,</v>

<v Speaker 1>This is what I saw.</v>

606
00:16:20.091 --> 00:16:21.310
