1
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.660
<v Speaker 1>And we're live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

2
00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:09.590
<v Speaker 1>Paul,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

3
00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:11.600
<v Speaker 1>welcome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you for coming here.</v>

4
00:00:11.601 --> 00:00:16.601
<v Speaker 1>And you are probably one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>requested people from the Internet that </v>

5
00:00:16.601 --> 00:00:17.060
<v Speaker 1>I've ever had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So feel good about that.</v>

6
00:00:17.061 --> 00:00:22.061
<v Speaker 1>And I'm honored.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he the first guy ever to wear a </v>

7
00:00:22.061 --> 00:00:22.061
<v Speaker 1>mushroom hat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

8
00:00:22.061 --> 00:00:22.220
<v Speaker 1>That's really a hat made out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms.</v>

9
00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:25.000
<v Speaker 1>It's made from this on the do mushroom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

10
00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:30.120
<v Speaker 1>it's called families from materials.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It grows on birch trees throughout the </v>

11
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.621
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this is an example of why I think </v>

12
00:00:32.621 --> 00:00:35.720
<v Speaker 1>shamanistic Lee plants mushrooms become </v>
<v Speaker 1>significant.</v>

13
00:00:35.721 --> 00:00:40.721
<v Speaker 1>There's a plurality of benefits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this mushrooms a fire starter </v>

14
00:00:40.721 --> 00:00:42.530
<v Speaker 1>mushroom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It allowed for the portability of fire.</v>

15
00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.120
<v Speaker 1>There's no doubt that we came from </v>
<v Speaker 1>Africa.</v>

16
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:49.240
<v Speaker 1>We migrated north,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we discovered something new called </v>

17
00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.240
<v Speaker 1>winter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oops.</v>

18
00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.970
<v Speaker 1>This allowed for the portability of </v>
<v Speaker 1>fire.</v>

19
00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.420
<v Speaker 1>You can hollow this mushroom output </v>
<v Speaker 1>embers of a fire inside and carry fire </v>

20
00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.420
<v Speaker 1>for days.</v>

21
00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.520
<v Speaker 1>If your clan could not rekindle fire in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Europe in the wintertime,</v>

22
00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:00.620
<v Speaker 1>you would die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you.</v>

23
00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.320
<v Speaker 1>This has actually made by some ladies in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Transylvania.</v>

24
00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:04.420
<v Speaker 1>Can I feel that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

25
00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:05.960
<v Speaker 1>And it's a hard wood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Conk.</v>

26
00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.340
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when you soak it in lye water,</v>

27
00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.420
<v Speaker 1>ashes and water it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the laminate's into this fabric.</v>

28
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.100
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me feel that.</v>

29
00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.500
<v Speaker 1>It's very soft.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also called German felt.</v>

30
00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.400
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's extremely flammable.</v>

31
00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.960
<v Speaker 1>So it revolutionized warfare because Don</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nepal,</v>

32
00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:30.980
<v Speaker 1>iconic napoleonic times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the punk that ignited gunpowder.</v>

33
00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.480
<v Speaker 1>So even the Chinese invented the Chinese</v>
<v Speaker 1>invented gunpowder,</v>

34
00:01:35.481 --> 00:01:40.481
<v Speaker 1>the Europeans and then had the rifle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this allowed flint spark guns to </v>

35
00:01:40.481 --> 00:01:41.870
<v Speaker 1>ignite the gunpowder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This feels amazing.</v>

36
00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.830
<v Speaker 1>It is as big a piece.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you get that?</v>

37
00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.960
<v Speaker 1>That's a great question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Depending on the size of the conch on </v>

38
00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.960
<v Speaker 1>beech trees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're much bigger than birch.</v>

39
00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:50.450
<v Speaker 1>These trees just naturally get larger.</v>

40
00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:53.180
<v Speaker 1>So the larger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more fabric you can tear.</v>

41
00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:58.540
<v Speaker 1>But this mushroom is made of mycelium </v>
<v Speaker 1>and basically what that fabric is a </v>

42
00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.810
<v Speaker 1>cellular fabric called mycelium.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is,</v>

43
00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.960
<v Speaker 1>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>

44
00:02:02.961 --> 00:02:05.930
<v Speaker 1>I have one that caught on fire because </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone was smoking a joint near me.</v>

45
00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:11.050
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the and the embers of the joint got on </v>

46
00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.050
<v Speaker 1>my hat to just immediately go up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

47
00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:12.530
<v Speaker 1>it burns really slowly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a fuse.</v>

48
00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.080
<v Speaker 1>It's fantastic for delayed explosions as</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you can light this thing and </v>

49
00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.900
<v Speaker 1>beekeepers for hundreds of years used </v>
<v Speaker 1>this for smoking the hives of bees </v>

50
00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:23.930
<v Speaker 1>because it's um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

51
00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:25.520
<v Speaker 1>we could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we could light it now.</v>

52
00:02:25.521 --> 00:02:28.550
<v Speaker 1>I mean the whole thing would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one flick of the bic and this thing will</v>

53
00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.340
<v Speaker 1>smoke entirely in about 10 minutes and </v>
<v Speaker 1>turn nothing.</v>

54
00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.420
<v Speaker 1>Nothing into white ash.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

55
00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.310
<v Speaker 1>Your fire alarms may go off though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

56
00:02:37.311 --> 00:02:38.060
<v Speaker 1>probably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

57
00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.400
<v Speaker 1>Also with this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this larger piece,</v>

58
00:02:40.401 --> 00:02:42.740
<v Speaker 1>they would hollow this out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put an ember in there.</v>

59
00:02:42.741 --> 00:02:47.741
<v Speaker 1>Would they have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll have to blow on the ember as </v>

60
00:02:47.741 --> 00:02:47.741
<v Speaker 1>they hiked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

61
00:02:47.741 --> 00:02:50.381
<v Speaker 1>you could blow it on a little bit and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you cap it and then you can put it in </v>

62
00:02:50.381 --> 00:02:52.961
<v Speaker 1>your pocket.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The famous iceman that was found on the </v>

63
00:02:52.961 --> 00:02:53.690
<v Speaker 1>border of view in Austria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had this tethered to his right side,</v>

64
00:02:53.691 --> 00:02:56.060
<v Speaker 1>which is a position of significance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

65
00:02:56.061 --> 00:02:58.220
<v Speaker 1>things that you need,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like your knife,</v>

66
00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:03.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and things you want to make sure you </v>

67
00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.250
<v Speaker 1>have if you're right handed you this on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the right side.</v>

68
00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.321
<v Speaker 1>So there's this one example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a thread of knowledge of use of </v>

69
00:03:07.451 --> 00:03:12.451
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms that goes over millennia and </v>
<v Speaker 1>most of those threads have been frayed </v>

70
00:03:12.451 --> 00:03:16.111
<v Speaker 1>or broken in the chain of knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is one of the threads that was </v>

71
00:03:16.111 --> 00:03:17.740
<v Speaker 1>not broken and it's significant.</v>

72
00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:22.740
<v Speaker 1>I think it's we are much more dependent </v>
<v Speaker 1>upon mushrooms when we were forest </v>

73
00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:24.850
<v Speaker 1>people than we are now seemingly in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cities,</v>

74
00:03:24.851 --> 00:03:27.460
<v Speaker 1>but it's coming full circle very </v>
<v Speaker 1>quickly.</v>

75
00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:30.430
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms are weird in that some of them</v>

76
00:03:30.431 --> 00:03:35.431
<v Speaker 1>are incredibly edible and nutritious and</v>
<v Speaker 1>other ones will kill you and sometimes </v>

77
00:03:35.431 --> 00:03:36.940
<v Speaker 1>they look really similar to each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

78
00:03:36.941 --> 00:03:41.710
<v Speaker 1>this is the mystery of mushrooms and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think it speaks to also Michael Phobia,</v>

79
00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:45.940
<v Speaker 1>the fear of mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>R Gordon Wasson first coined that term,</v>

80
00:03:45.941 --> 00:03:50.440
<v Speaker 1>but when you think about it in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>visual landscape with animals,</v>

81
00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:53.560
<v Speaker 1>you see them for months,</v>
<v Speaker 1>years in plants,</v>

82
00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.920
<v Speaker 1>so you have a familiarity factor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but mushrooms that come up and </v>

83
00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.340
<v Speaker 1>disappeared for five days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of them can feed you,</v>

84
00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.770
<v Speaker 1>some can kill you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some can heal you,</v>

85
00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:05.080
<v Speaker 1>some can send to you on a spiritual </v>
<v Speaker 1>journey.</v>

86
00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.410
<v Speaker 1>So to have something so powerful and yet</v>
<v Speaker 1>so ephemeral,</v>

87
00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:14.460
<v Speaker 1>it's natural for humans to avoid that </v>
<v Speaker 1>which they don't understand out of fear </v>

88
00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:15.430
<v Speaker 1>because they don't know the difference.</v>

89
00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:19.330
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>23 primates consume mushrooms,</v>

90
00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:24.630
<v Speaker 1>humans being one of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so that speaks to a long ancestral </v>

91
00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:28.111
<v Speaker 1>use of mushrooms going back in our </v>
<v Speaker 1>primate evolutionary tree for a very,</v>

92
00:04:28.661 --> 00:04:29.980
<v Speaker 1>very long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

93
00:04:29.981 --> 00:04:33.430
<v Speaker 1>how many species of mushrooms are there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know that you asked,</v>

94
00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:35.800
<v Speaker 1>you asked me that question five years </v>
<v Speaker 1>ago,</v>

95
00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:39.220
<v Speaker 1>I would've said one point $5 million and</v>
<v Speaker 1>now we're up to about $5.</v>

96
00:04:39.221 --> 00:04:44.221
<v Speaker 1>Million is being is being estimated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plant fungi outnumber plants five to 10 </v>

97
00:04:44.741 --> 00:04:49.741
<v Speaker 1>to one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I just speak at Ted and I've gone to</v>

98
00:04:50.471 --> 00:04:55.471
<v Speaker 1>these ted conferences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's shocking with the smartest </v>

99
00:04:55.471 --> 00:04:57.460
<v Speaker 1>brains in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not until just recently did they realize</v>

100
00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:59.740
<v Speaker 1>what us mycologists have known for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>long time.</v>

101
00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:04.780
<v Speaker 1>Thirty percent of the soil mass when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're walking on soil,</v>

102
00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:08.260
<v Speaker 1>the 30 percent of the biological carbon </v>
<v Speaker 1>is fungal.</v>

103
00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:11.050
<v Speaker 1>And the biggest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>biggest whoa,</v>

104
00:05:11.051 --> 00:05:11.700
<v Speaker 1>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>

105
00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:13.720
<v Speaker 1>Say that again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thirty percent.</v>

106
00:05:13.721 --> 00:05:18.430
<v Speaker 1>Thirty percent of soil is fungal mass </v>
<v Speaker 1>living and dead of healthy soil,</v>

107
00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:24.180
<v Speaker 1>so and this is the biggest repository of</v>
<v Speaker 1>carbon in the world in the ground is </v>

108
00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:30.060
<v Speaker 1>related to these fungal networks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there is about eight point three to </v>

109
00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:32.710
<v Speaker 1>about 10 million species on the planet </v>
<v Speaker 1>about right now,</v>

110
00:05:32.711 --> 00:05:37.711
<v Speaker 1>about half of those are fungal species.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They outnumber plants up to eight to </v>

111
00:05:37.711 --> 00:05:39.370
<v Speaker 1>1:10</v>
<v Speaker 1>to one by by some estimates,</v>

112
00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:44.850
<v Speaker 1>a really nice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting metric in one meter of a </v>

113
00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:47.590
<v Speaker 1>tree root for every meter of a tree </v>
<v Speaker 1>root.</v>

114
00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:53.160
<v Speaker 1>There's a kilometer of Mycelium,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think of that three feet versus 2100 </v>

115
00:05:55.691 --> 00:06:00.691
<v Speaker 1>feet so that the extensiveness of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mycelial network in our landscapes is </v>

116
00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:04.370
<v Speaker 1>vast and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

117
00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:06.710
<v Speaker 1>as I call it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Earth's natural internet as it is.</v>

118
00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:10.220
<v Speaker 1>These are membranes that are literally </v>
<v Speaker 1>sensitive.</v>

119
00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:15.370
<v Speaker 1>I think they're sentient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They respond to every footprint that we </v>

120
00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:15.370
<v Speaker 1>take on this planet.</v>

121
00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:20.830
<v Speaker 1>And as you walk across landscapes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're breaking wood and that makes new </v>

122
00:06:21.561 --> 00:06:24.140
<v Speaker 1>nutrition available.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the competition of fungi to find that</v>

123
00:06:24.141 --> 00:06:26.120
<v Speaker 1>new new nutritionist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fierce.</v>

124
00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:31.690
<v Speaker 1>And so first to the menu winds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is something that we are now </v>

125
00:06:32.421 --> 00:06:37.421
<v Speaker 1>understanding how essential they are for</v>
<v Speaker 1>preserving biodiversity and for the </v>

126
00:06:37.421 --> 00:06:39.590
<v Speaker 1>health of the ecosystems as well as our </v>
<v Speaker 1>own personal health.</v>

127
00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:41.570
<v Speaker 1>So when you say you think they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>sentient,</v>

128
00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:44.420
<v Speaker 1>to what degree?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean and you're not talking about just</v>

129
00:06:44.421 --> 00:06:49.421
<v Speaker 1>like silicide and your Mascara.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're kind of intellectually provincial </v>

130
00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:55.330
<v Speaker 1>in that we are using language and we've </v>
<v Speaker 1>ended terms in order to describe </v>

131
00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:56.450
<v Speaker 1>concepts that we're trying to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're struggling with.</v>

132
00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:59.720
<v Speaker 1>So the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me describe it this way,</v>

133
00:06:59.721 --> 00:07:03.800
<v Speaker 1>that we separated from fungi $650 </v>
<v Speaker 1>million years ago.</v>

134
00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:05.620
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>

135
00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:08.290
<v Speaker 1>I know some people that are probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>still will.</v>

136
00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:09.650
<v Speaker 1>Basically we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

137
00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:12.680
<v Speaker 1>we are descendants of fungi.</v>

138
00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:18.640
<v Speaker 1>We share a more common ancestry with </v>
<v Speaker 1>fungi than we do with any of their </v>

139
00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:19.880
<v Speaker 1>kingdom and fungi are closer to animals </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the plants.</v>

140
00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:25.100
<v Speaker 1>Animals came from fungi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You and I are actually fungal bodies.</v>

141
00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:29.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm speaking to basically another fungal</v>
<v Speaker 1>body right now.</v>

142
00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:32.180
<v Speaker 1>So Joe Rogan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean whether you know it or not,</v>

143
00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:37.540
<v Speaker 1>you are basically a fungal mass from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>cellular point of view under the </v>

144
00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:38.060
<v Speaker 1>microscope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A human cells,</v>

145
00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:39.920
<v Speaker 1>animal cells.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Fungal cells are very,</v>

146
00:07:39.921 --> 00:07:42.410
<v Speaker 1>very similar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We exhale carbon dioxide,</v>

147
00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:45.260
<v Speaker 1>inhale oxygen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as do fungus.</v>

148
00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:47.570
<v Speaker 1>The fungus does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We separated from fungi.</v>

149
00:07:47.571 --> 00:07:52.571
<v Speaker 1>Basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we chose the route to encapsulate our </v>

150
00:07:52.571 --> 00:07:54.431
<v Speaker 1>nutrients in a cellular Osaka stomach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>digesting our nutrients within the </v>

151
00:07:54.431 --> 00:07:56.930
<v Speaker 1>fungal systems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>digest their nutrients externally.</v>

152
00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:02.440
<v Speaker 1>They exhale oxygen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>inhale carbon dioxide and their network </v>

153
00:08:04.291 --> 00:08:07.300
<v Speaker 1>like design allows them to respond to </v>
<v Speaker 1>catastrophic.</v>

154
00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:12.610
<v Speaker 1>And what I mean by that is that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mycelial networks,</v>

155
00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:18.040
<v Speaker 1>they're so dense in the soil and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>have literally hundreds of billions of </v>

156
00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:19.130
<v Speaker 1>tips.</v>

157
00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:24.610
<v Speaker 1>And as these tips are growing out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they tend to be polynucleotide at the </v>

158
00:08:24.681 --> 00:08:29.030
<v Speaker 1>tips and it allows them to upregulate </v>
<v Speaker 1>new enzymes,</v>

159
00:08:29.031 --> 00:08:30.450
<v Speaker 1>acid sequences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>

160
00:08:30.451 --> 00:08:32.120
<v Speaker 1>So if there's a new ecological </v>
<v Speaker 1>challenge,</v>

161
00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:34.490
<v Speaker 1>new food source,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a new toxin or something,</v>

162
00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:40.090
<v Speaker 1>these fungal networks are so a great </v>
<v Speaker 1>plasticity in being able to code for new</v>

163
00:08:41.541 --> 00:08:46.541
<v Speaker 1>sequences from their DNA.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So all you need is one of those hundreds</v>

164
00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:52.360
<v Speaker 1>of billions of tips to find a new enzyme</v>
<v Speaker 1>to break down a toxin or a new food </v>

165
00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:55.481
<v Speaker 1>source.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what happens then is that </v>

166
00:08:55.481 --> 00:08:57.851
<v Speaker 1>information then is incorporated </v>
<v Speaker 1>genetically into the mycelial network </v>

167
00:08:57.851 --> 00:09:02.010
<v Speaker 1>and the mycelium then surges because as </v>
<v Speaker 1>new food logically and so when it surges</v>

168
00:09:02.011 --> 00:09:05.190
<v Speaker 1>named creates a new what's called a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sector of Mycelium,</v>

169
00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:10.490
<v Speaker 1>we now know there's evidence that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mycelial network then that benefits from</v>

170
00:09:10.861 --> 00:09:15.861
<v Speaker 1>that tip exploration and discovery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So these are like massively resilient,</v>

171
00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:21.240
<v Speaker 1>adaptive organisms that have a network </v>
<v Speaker 1>based design,</v>

172
00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:23.850
<v Speaker 1>not dissimilar from that of our neural </v>
<v Speaker 1>networks,</v>

173
00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:28.880
<v Speaker 1>not dissimilar from the computer </v>
<v Speaker 1>internet and more and more that I </v>

174
00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:30.960
<v Speaker 1>explore this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more I'm convinced that we will find</v>

175
00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:33.240
<v Speaker 1>network based organisms throughout the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cosmos,</v>

176
00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:38.750
<v Speaker 1>probably fungal systems and fungal </v>
<v Speaker 1>systems ultimately give rise,</v>

177
00:09:39.031 --> 00:09:44.031
<v Speaker 1>in our case animals and it's more likely</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll find fungal animal relationships </v>

178
00:09:44.031 --> 00:09:44.490
<v Speaker 1>all throughout the universe.</v>

179
00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:45.220
<v Speaker 1>Do you think</v>

180
00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:50.330
<v Speaker 2>that there's some unknown way that </v>
<v Speaker 2>animals are connected in some sort of a </v>

181
00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:51.540
<v Speaker 2>similar way as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that if,</v>

182
00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:56.680
<v Speaker 2>if animals came from fungus and fungus </v>
<v Speaker 2>has this incredible way of communicating</v>

183
00:09:57.101 --> 00:09:59.470
<v Speaker 2>with each other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you think that there's something like</v>

184
00:09:59.471 --> 00:10:01.870
<v Speaker 2>that with the animal kingdom that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>haven't discovered?</v>

185
00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:07.840
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that stimulates my thought into talking </v>

186
00:10:09.051 --> 00:10:11.930
<v Speaker 1>about the microbiome,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mycelial landscapes,</v>

187
00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:14.720
<v Speaker 1>networks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't live by themselves.</v>

188
00:10:14.721 --> 00:10:19.721
<v Speaker 1>They select a microbiome of bacteria and</v>
<v Speaker 1>other organisms that rest upon the </v>

189
00:10:19.721 --> 00:10:21.620
<v Speaker 1>mantle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These fungal networks are the foundation</v>

190
00:10:21.621 --> 00:10:23.420
<v Speaker 1>of the food web.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

191
00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:28.810
<v Speaker 1>similarly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have a microbiome and it's really </v>

192
00:10:28.810 --> 00:10:32.981
<v Speaker 1>interesting that the many of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bacterial diseases that infect fungi </v>

193
00:10:32.981 --> 00:10:36.910
<v Speaker 1>also affect us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our best antibiotics against bacteria </v>

194
00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:38.270
<v Speaker 1>come from fungi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Penicillin being the obvious example,</v>

195
00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:41.690
<v Speaker 1>but we have found out during sex next </v>
<v Speaker 1>gen sequencing,</v>

196
00:10:41.691 --> 00:10:43.280
<v Speaker 1>and this has never been published </v>
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>

197
00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:48.670
<v Speaker 1>that the mycelial mats growing in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>very same wood chips in our case that </v>

198
00:10:50.181 --> 00:10:54.530
<v Speaker 1>we'd been fermented.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had a thousand fold difference in the</v>

199
00:10:54.531 --> 00:10:58.490
<v Speaker 1>relative abundance of Genera of bacteria</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the very same wood chips.</v>

200
00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:03.580
<v Speaker 1>Two different mushroom species planted </v>
<v Speaker 1>on these wood chips and the microbiomes </v>

201
00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:08.810
<v Speaker 1>that were created and selected for by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the mycelium were vastly different.</v>

202
00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:14.110
<v Speaker 1>This really strongly supports the </v>
<v Speaker 1>concept is the hypothesis with quickly </v>

203
00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:16.220
<v Speaker 1>becoming a theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll explain the difference in a minute,</v>

204
00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:20.840
<v Speaker 1>but this really supports the concept </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I've long believed that a spouse,</v>

205
00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:23.930
<v Speaker 1>that these mycelial networks are there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just happenstance,</v>

206
00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:29.230
<v Speaker 1>they are just creating the habitats and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the flora and then ultimately the fauna </v>

207
00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:34.480
<v Speaker 1>that are resident within the ecosystem </v>
<v Speaker 1>to guarantee the plurality and the </v>

208
00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:35.750
<v Speaker 1>biodiversity of the ecosystem by </v>
<v Speaker 1>creating the plants that create,</v>

209
00:11:35.751 --> 00:11:37.460
<v Speaker 1>that grow up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that feed the animals,</v>

210
00:11:37.461 --> 00:11:42.461
<v Speaker 1>the insects to create the debris fields </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then feed the mycelium for the </v>

211
00:11:42.461 --> 00:11:42.710
<v Speaker 1>benefit of the progeny of the mushrooms </v>
<v Speaker 1>out form thereafter.</v>

212
00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:47.950
<v Speaker 1>So these are deterministic organisms </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are setting the stage for </v>

213
00:11:47.950 --> 00:11:48.800
<v Speaker 1>ecological evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you think that they're doing this in</v>

214
00:11:48.801 --> 00:11:50.810
<v Speaker 1>a conscious manner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

215
00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:55.980
<v Speaker 1>see again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're victims of our consciousness </v>

216
00:11:55.980 --> 00:11:58.440
<v Speaker 1>trying to define what is conscious and </v>
<v Speaker 1>what a smart and one of the best </v>

217
00:11:58.440 --> 00:11:59.710
<v Speaker 1>arguments I've had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my brother builds a super genius,</v>

218
00:11:59.711 --> 00:12:03.460
<v Speaker 1>is far smarter than myself and he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>editing one of my books,</v>

219
00:12:03.461 --> 00:12:05.840
<v Speaker 1>mycelium running how mushrooms can help </v>
<v Speaker 1>save the world.</v>

220
00:12:05.841 --> 00:12:07.360
<v Speaker 1>And and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Paul,</v>

221
00:12:07.361 --> 00:12:12.361
<v Speaker 1>you cannot say that mycelium is </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligent and that you can't say </v>

222
00:12:12.361 --> 00:12:13.750
<v Speaker 1>nature is intelligent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

223
00:12:13.810 --> 00:12:15.190
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bill,</v>

224
00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:20.280
<v Speaker 1>I respect you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you didn't realize that how poc of </v>

225
00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:23.481
<v Speaker 1>the statement that you're giving me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're telling me nature is not </v>

226
00:12:23.481 --> 00:12:23.481
<v Speaker 1>intelligent and yet you are born of </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature.</v>

227
00:12:23.481 --> 00:12:28.471
<v Speaker 1>Using the mind to conceive the concept </v>
<v Speaker 1>that challenge the idea that nature is </v>

228
00:12:28.471 --> 00:12:28.690
<v Speaker 1>not intelligent when you are part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature.</v>

229
00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:31.870
<v Speaker 1>I rest my case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

230
00:12:31.871 --> 00:12:33.190
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's indefensible.</v>

231
00:12:33.191 --> 00:12:34.690
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we're.</v>

232
00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:37.300
<v Speaker 1>We create language and words to describe</v>
<v Speaker 1>concepts.</v>

233
00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:42.340
<v Speaker 2>So you feel like your brother was sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>of hampered by these predetermined </v>

234
00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:43.020
<v Speaker 2>categories that we like to put things </v>
<v Speaker 2>into it.</v>

235
00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:44.840
<v Speaker 2>You have a word,</v>
<v Speaker 2>use that word.</v>

236
00:12:44.841 --> 00:12:47.050
<v Speaker 2>The word is very clearly defined in our.</v>

237
00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:48.460
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

238
00:12:48.461 --> 00:12:52.930
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Language is code and we don't have.</v>

239
00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:56.170
<v Speaker 1>We haven't elaborated the code yet to </v>
<v Speaker 1>elucidate the concepts that we're trying</v>

240
00:12:56.171 --> 00:12:59.200
<v Speaker 1>to articulate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That does not mean that just because you</v>

241
00:12:59.201 --> 00:13:01.240
<v Speaker 1>can't prove it's true doesn't mean it </v>
<v Speaker 1>hasn't happened.</v>

242
00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:04.840
<v Speaker 1>So as our vocabulary increases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

243
00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:09.210
<v Speaker 1>as our lexicon of language increases of </v>
<v Speaker 1>more robust than I think we can better,</v>

244
00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:14.220
<v Speaker 1>better describe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>test and prove that these concepts are </v>

245
00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:15.280
<v Speaker 1>true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we are biologically provincial.</v>

246
00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:20.970
<v Speaker 1>When we think about how limited we are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're truly neanderthals with nuclear </v>

247
00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:22.900
<v Speaker 1>weapons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is when you look at the how,</v>

248
00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:27.670
<v Speaker 1>how important natural ecosystems are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to replicate them.</v>

249
00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:30.040
<v Speaker 1>They're very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very difficult to replicate due to their</v>

250
00:13:30.041 --> 00:13:35.041
<v Speaker 1>complexity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I think the more that we study </v>

251
00:13:35.041 --> 00:13:37.351
<v Speaker 1>nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most all of us scientists subscribe to </v>

252
00:13:37.351 --> 00:13:38.530
<v Speaker 1>the adage that the more we studied the </v>
<v Speaker 1>subject,</v>

253
00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:43.590
<v Speaker 1>the more we realized we didn't know and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Hubris of us thinking that these </v>

254
00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:45.580
<v Speaker 1>things cannot occur,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did not occur,</v>

255
00:13:45.581 --> 00:13:49.690
<v Speaker 1>will not occur,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really speaks to our provincial attitude</v>

256
00:13:49.691 --> 00:13:50.290
<v Speaker 1>towards nature.</v>

257
00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:56.060
<v Speaker 2>The idea that these fungus fungi are </v>
<v Speaker 2>creating their environment and almost </v>

258
00:13:58.950 --> 00:14:00.990
<v Speaker 2>they're the architects of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>environment.</v>

259
00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:06.310
<v Speaker 2>They're establishing the landscape for </v>
<v Speaker 2>all these different creatures and </v>

260
00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:07.890
<v Speaker 2>lifeforms to live is unbelievably </v>
<v Speaker 2>fascinating.</v>

261
00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:11.310
<v Speaker 2>The idea that and also that they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>connected,</v>

262
00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:13.260
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're connected in some sort of almost</v>

263
00:14:13.261 --> 00:14:18.261
<v Speaker 2>like a neural network and there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is that thing in the Pacific </v>

264
00:14:18.261 --> 00:14:22.731
<v Speaker 2>northwest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the one fungus group that's essentially </v>

265
00:14:22.731 --> 00:14:23.160
<v Speaker 2>the largest living organism on the face </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the earth.</v>

266
00:14:23.290 --> 00:14:25.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The largest organism in the world so far</v>

267
00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:30.630
<v Speaker 1>discovered is a mycelial mat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twenty 200 acres in size and that's </v>

268
00:14:30.630 --> 00:14:35.070
<v Speaker 1>equivalent to about 665 football fields.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one animal is one man,</v>

269
00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:40.330
<v Speaker 1>one mycelial mat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a honey mushroom that kills trees.</v>

270
00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:43.000
<v Speaker 1>It's an edible mushroom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but think of this.</v>

271
00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:45.850
<v Speaker 1>Let me think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for those listeners out there,</v>

272
00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:50.910
<v Speaker 1>if any soil biologist know this well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you go out and get some nice rich </v>

273
00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:52.370
<v Speaker 1>soil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a of it and you analyze,</v>

274
00:14:52.371 --> 00:14:57.371
<v Speaker 1>it typically is a million 5 million </v>
<v Speaker 1>microbes per gram in that soil.</v>

275
00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:04.200
<v Speaker 1>Now the mycelium is growing out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have five or six skin layers that </v>

276
00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:07.871
<v Speaker 1>protect us from infection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The mycelium only has one cell wall on </v>

277
00:15:07.871 --> 00:15:11.951
<v Speaker 1>the other side of that cell wall are </v>
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of millions of microbes per </v>

278
00:15:11.951 --> 00:15:14.771
<v Speaker 1>gram that are trying to consume it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many of which the mycelium is able to </v>

279
00:15:14.771 --> 00:15:19.090
<v Speaker 1>upregulate and constant biomolecular </v>
<v Speaker 1>communication with this ecosystem be </v>

280
00:15:19.090 --> 00:15:21.350
<v Speaker 1>able to prevent predators from consuming</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

281
00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:24.890
<v Speaker 1>thus allowing it to achieve the largest </v>
<v Speaker 1>mass of any organism in the world.</v>

282
00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:30.340
<v Speaker 1>This is amazing to me because it means </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it is constantly in communication </v>

283
00:15:31.041 --> 00:15:36.041
<v Speaker 1>with the ecosystem being challenged,</v>
<v Speaker 1>accepting alliances,</v>

284
00:15:36.081 --> 00:15:41.081
<v Speaker 1>so guilds of microbiomes are being </v>
<v Speaker 1>created selected by the mycelium and </v>

285
00:15:41.661 --> 00:15:46.160
<v Speaker 1>these guilds and communities then </v>
<v Speaker 1>cooperate in order to prevent pathogens,</v>

286
00:15:46.161 --> 00:15:51.161
<v Speaker 1>parasites,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even competing guilds from coming into </v>

287
00:15:51.161 --> 00:15:53.561
<v Speaker 1>that landscape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the dominance of these fungi are to </v>

288
00:15:53.561 --> 00:15:54.320
<v Speaker 1>ensure the ecosystems give lives to </v>
<v Speaker 1>their progeny.</v>

289
00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:57.230
<v Speaker 1>The rule of natural selection of life is</v>
<v Speaker 1>reproduction,</v>

290
00:15:57.800 --> 00:15:59.990
<v Speaker 1>so everything steers towards </v>
<v Speaker 1>reproduction.</v>

291
00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:02.210
<v Speaker 1>So from evolutionary biology point of </v>
<v Speaker 1>view,</v>

292
00:16:02.211 --> 00:16:07.211
<v Speaker 1>what will that organism do to help </v>
<v Speaker 1>survive so he can reproduce and </v>

293
00:16:08.330 --> 00:16:13.330
<v Speaker 1>reproduction through creating guilds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>communities of the microbiome using the </v>

294
00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:17.291
<v Speaker 1>mycelial network as the structural </v>
<v Speaker 1>foundation of the food web seems to be </v>

295
00:16:17.291 --> 00:16:19.460
<v Speaker 1>the name of the game here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this honey mushroom,</v>

296
00:16:19.461 --> 00:16:21.980
<v Speaker 1>is that what it's called?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that lives in the Pacific northwest.</v>

297
00:16:21.981 --> 00:16:22.160
<v Speaker 1>It.</v>

298
00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:25.100
<v Speaker 1>How is it killing these trees is a root </v>
<v Speaker 1>parasite,</v>

299
00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:30.340
<v Speaker 1>so it comes in and kills the trees and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>spent a lot of time in the old growth </v>

300
00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:34.721
<v Speaker 1>forest and a lot of hiking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've always been one wondering about </v>

301
00:16:34.721 --> 00:16:37.720
<v Speaker 1>meadows and the sub Alpine regions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's all these subalpine forests and </v>

302
00:16:37.761 --> 00:16:39.890
<v Speaker 1>then you come out and it is giant </v>
<v Speaker 1>meadows.</v>

303
00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:44.180
<v Speaker 1>I suspect that the honey mushroom is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>meadow maker.</v>

304
00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:47.810
<v Speaker 1>It climaxes these trees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It kills them.</v>

305
00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:51.470
<v Speaker 1>They then die and then they grow out </v>
<v Speaker 1>prophetically,</v>

306
00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:54.290
<v Speaker 1>but then it clears the canopy for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>grasses landscape,</v>

307
00:16:55.270 --> 00:16:57.500
<v Speaker 1>sap prophetic music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's growing on dead material,</v>

308
00:16:57.710 --> 00:17:00.220
<v Speaker 1>so first is a parasite mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mushrooms,</v>

309
00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:02.600
<v Speaker 1>the persons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The parasite kills the tree.</v>

310
00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:06.290
<v Speaker 1>That's a sacrifice or sap probe as </v>
<v Speaker 1>another word for it.</v>

311
00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:09.620
<v Speaker 1>It's a decomposer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It breaks down that material,</v>

312
00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:14.480
<v Speaker 1>but as it decomposes the wood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>30 percent of wood becomes water,</v>

313
00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:19.900
<v Speaker 1>so the mycelium generates water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so water lenses are being created that </v>

314
00:17:19.910 --> 00:17:21.140
<v Speaker 1>now you have more sunlight.</v>

315
00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:26.230
<v Speaker 1>Grasses then flourish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so I suspected that these mushrooms </v>

316
00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:30.041
<v Speaker 1>are actually meadow makers allowing then</v>
<v Speaker 1>the elk and the deer and marmots and </v>

317
00:17:30.041 --> 00:17:34.850
<v Speaker 1>whatnot to exist in those grassland </v>
<v Speaker 1>environments as a way of rebuilding the </v>

318
00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:38.831
<v Speaker 1>nitrogen sources in the soil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think these are over great huge </v>

319
00:17:41.361 --> 00:17:46.361
<v Speaker 1>time scales.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to get away from the concept of </v>

320
00:17:46.361 --> 00:17:46.361
<v Speaker 1>our lifespan or even 100,</v>
<v Speaker 1>200 years.</v>

321
00:17:46.361 --> 00:17:49.410
<v Speaker 1>We need to think in millennial terms </v>
<v Speaker 1>over many,</v>

322
00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:52.680
<v Speaker 1>many millennia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is unbelievably fascinating.</v>

323
00:17:53.370 --> 00:17:57.300
<v Speaker 1>The idea that they're sort of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>architects of their ecosystem.</v>

324
00:17:57.780 --> 00:17:59.580
<v Speaker 1>They are the architects of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>existence.</v>

325
00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:05.150
<v Speaker 1>This is something that there's a really </v>
<v Speaker 1>fantastic research that's come out in </v>

326
00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:06.540
<v Speaker 1>the past two years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm.</v>

327
00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:09.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm a science ambassador,</v>
<v Speaker 1>flared AAA's,</v>

328
00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:13.770
<v Speaker 1>the American Association of Science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I am a little bit out there,</v>

329
00:18:13.771 --> 00:18:18.771
<v Speaker 1>but I'm really happy that I have so much</v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific support these days because a </v>

330
00:18:18.771 --> 00:18:19.080
<v Speaker 1>lot of the things I've been talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about for 20 years now,</v>

331
00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:20.670
<v Speaker 1>well rooted and been proven.</v>

332
00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:24.360
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that that has been so </v>
<v Speaker 1>fascinating to me,</v>

333
00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:26.640
<v Speaker 1>and I'm still wrapping my mind around </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

334
00:18:27.090 --> 00:18:32.090
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the universe was created about 13 point </v>

335
00:18:32.090 --> 00:18:35.961
<v Speaker 1>8 billion years ago from the Big Bang.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The earth coalesced out of star at us </v>

336
00:18:35.961 --> 00:18:40.101
<v Speaker 1>about four point 5 billion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The earliest records of life we have is </v>

337
00:18:40.101 --> 00:18:43.680
<v Speaker 1>about three point 8 billion years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Single cell,</v>

338
00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:49.700
<v Speaker 1>single celled organisms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just recently in lava beds in South </v>

339
00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:52.650
<v Speaker 1>Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they found mycelium infused to the lava.</v>

340
00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:58.350
<v Speaker 1>Two point 4 billion years ago now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we split from fungi,</v>

341
00:18:58.351 --> 00:19:02.430
<v Speaker 1>650 million years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then in Brazil this past year,</v>

342
00:19:02.431 --> 00:19:07.431
<v Speaker 1>they found a fully intact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>apparently a fossilized mushroom </v>

343
00:19:07.431 --> 00:19:11.240
<v Speaker 1>published in nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a very reputable scientific </v>

344
00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:15.081
<v Speaker 1>journal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that one is one point 4 billion </v>

345
00:19:15.081 --> 00:19:15.930
<v Speaker 1>years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the oldest,</v>

346
00:19:15.931 --> 00:19:20.931
<v Speaker 1>multicellular organism in the fossil </v>
<v Speaker 1>record today is this fungus in lava in </v>

347
00:19:22.081 --> 00:19:24.060
<v Speaker 1>South Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two point 4 billion years ago,</v>

348
00:19:24.270 --> 00:19:28.500
<v Speaker 1>a fully formed mushroom who had this </v>
<v Speaker 1>form grew,</v>

349
00:19:28.790 --> 00:19:29.700
<v Speaker 1>was growing.</v>

350
00:19:29.790 --> 00:19:32.550
<v Speaker 1>One point 4 billion years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were.</v>

351
00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:35.220
<v Speaker 1>We separated from fungi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Six hundred 50 million years ago.</v>

352
00:19:35.221 --> 00:19:40.221
<v Speaker 1>Mushrooms had their form longer than </v>
<v Speaker 1>we've had our form by more than a </v>

353
00:19:40.221 --> 00:19:43.881
<v Speaker 1>billion years here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie just pulled it up on the screen </v>

354
00:19:43.881 --> 00:19:43.881
<v Speaker 1>here so we can take a look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One from Brazil.</v>

355
00:19:43.881 --> 00:19:47.940
<v Speaker 1>So this is the pause.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This though,</v>

356
00:19:47.941 --> 00:19:52.941
<v Speaker 1>the image that you're familiar with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one that has just been published in </v>

357
00:19:52.941 --> 00:19:57.471
<v Speaker 1>the past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have a great name that's a tongue </v>

358
00:19:57.471 --> 00:19:59.640
<v Speaker 1>twister to pronounce this Gondwana.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Garris ids magnificence.</v>

359
00:19:59.670 --> 00:20:02.430
<v Speaker 1>Why did they do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do that to make people like me feel</v>

360
00:20:02.431 --> 00:20:07.431
<v Speaker 1>stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't have to graduate students </v>

361
00:20:07.431 --> 00:20:07.860
<v Speaker 1>want to publish papers and said they get</v>
<v Speaker 1>invent names,</v>

362
00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:11.640
<v Speaker 1>so it looks better if you have a long </v>
<v Speaker 1>Latin sounding name,</v>

363
00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:12.690
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but think of that.</v>

364
00:20:12.691 --> 00:20:15.030
<v Speaker 1>Mushrooms had their form before we had </v>
<v Speaker 1>ours.</v>

365
00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:19.020
<v Speaker 1>These are elders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are ancient organisms.</v>

366
00:20:19.290 --> 00:20:24.290
<v Speaker 1>These are the really the the overlord </v>
<v Speaker 1>under lords of our ecosystem and I </v>

367
00:20:24.290 --> 00:20:27.210
<v Speaker 1>suspect and as these neural networks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have more neural connections in the</v>

368
00:20:27.211 --> 00:20:30.240
<v Speaker 1>mycelial mass over a thousand acres and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we have in our brain,</v>

369
00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:33.090
<v Speaker 1>they are actually accumulating </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge,</v>

370
00:20:33.091 --> 00:20:36.480
<v Speaker 1>genetic intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think that as time goes on,</v>

371
00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:40.680
<v Speaker 1>I hope that we have to interface with </v>
<v Speaker 1>them because I think there is a.</v>

372
00:20:41.010 --> 00:20:46.010
<v Speaker 1>There are many benefits of us </v>
<v Speaker 1>communicating with mycelium that can </v>

373
00:20:46.051 --> 00:20:50.500
<v Speaker 1>give us rapid responses to kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Straw.</v>

374
00:20:50.730 --> 00:20:55.730
<v Speaker 1>That's how they've evolved and we're now</v>
<v Speaker 1>the biggest walking catastrophe that I </v>

375
00:20:55.730 --> 00:20:59.761
<v Speaker 1>know walking across the planet and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>need to engage these fungal allies for </v>

376
00:20:59.761 --> 00:21:04.171
<v Speaker 1>the benefits that we need to put it into</v>
<v Speaker 1>play in order to prevent the loss of </v>

377
00:21:04.171 --> 00:21:04.450
<v Speaker 1>biodiversity.</v>

378
00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:09.590
<v Speaker 2>It seems like a communication gap would </v>
<v Speaker 2>be very hard to bridge that </v>

379
00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:10.170
<v Speaker 2>communication gap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

380
00:21:10.171 --> 00:21:15.171
<v Speaker 2>if we really did find a way to </v>
<v Speaker 2>communicate in some form with mushrooms,</v>

381
00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:18.360
<v Speaker 2>like the concept of language,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you were talking about,</v>

382
00:21:18.361 --> 00:21:22.290
<v Speaker 2>just the idea of nature and intelligence</v>
<v Speaker 2>and these words that we have,</v>

383
00:21:22.291 --> 00:21:27.291
<v Speaker 2>that we have these sort of concrete </v>
<v Speaker 2>definitions in our head that don't </v>

384
00:21:27.291 --> 00:21:29.310
<v Speaker 2>really apply to some things that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

385
00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:33.030
<v Speaker 2>very confusing to us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the idea of fungal intelligence,</v>

386
00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:38.360
<v Speaker 2>the idea that you could somehow or </v>
<v Speaker 2>another understand the language that </v>

387
00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:43.700
<v Speaker 2>these things we want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't even understand dolphin </v>

388
00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:43.700
<v Speaker 2>language.</v>

389
00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:44.320
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one classic example,</v>

390
00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:47.770
<v Speaker 1>example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Japanese are so clever at this.</v>

391
00:21:47.771 --> 00:21:52.771
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a slime mold called Pfizer </v>

392
00:21:52.771 --> 00:21:56.980
<v Speaker 1>polycephalum and they had a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this slime mold is very,</v>

393
00:21:56.981 --> 00:21:59.560
<v Speaker 1>very good at navigating through mazes </v>
<v Speaker 1>and challenges.</v>

394
00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:04.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first to food wins is conservation of </v>

395
00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:05.680
<v Speaker 1>energy as rewarded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you don't want to set this up.</v>

396
00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:08.680
<v Speaker 1>They like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They did several experiments.</v>

397
00:22:08.930 --> 00:22:09.700
<v Speaker 1>Fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most fun.</v>

398
00:22:09.701 --> 00:22:14.701
<v Speaker 1>One is they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they designed a nutrient basically </v>

399
00:22:16.151 --> 00:22:19.560
<v Speaker 1>nutrient like maze replicating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

400
00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:24.600
<v Speaker 1>Tokyo and the Japanese subway system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they started with Tokyo and they </v>

401
00:22:25.901 --> 00:22:28.300
<v Speaker 1>put oats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a nutritional source.</v>

402
00:22:28.301 --> 00:22:33.301
<v Speaker 1>They inoculated what is on this basic </v>
<v Speaker 1>and aggre map with all the major cities,</v>

403
00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:39.900
<v Speaker 1>the nodes around Tokyo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they then make each of those nodes </v>

404
00:22:40.150 --> 00:22:43.000
<v Speaker 1>had a piece of oat on them was a source </v>
<v Speaker 1>of nutrition.</v>

405
00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:48.300
<v Speaker 1>The main oat was where Tokyo was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They inoculated it and then they let the</v>

406
00:22:49.541 --> 00:22:54.541
<v Speaker 1>slime mold then grow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and first it grew out randomly </v>

407
00:22:54.541 --> 00:22:58.710
<v Speaker 1>exploratory Lee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like you would do if you're a </v>

408
00:22:58.710 --> 00:22:58.870
<v Speaker 1>hunter or something or hunting on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>landscape,</v>

409
00:22:58.871 --> 00:23:03.370
<v Speaker 1>looking for things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then after about 28 hours,</v>

410
00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:08.640
<v Speaker 1>it reorganized itself in the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>efficient way possible and reorganized </v>

411
00:23:09.821 --> 00:23:14.821
<v Speaker 1>the Japanese subway system in a more </v>
<v Speaker 1>efficient manner than it's designed </v>

412
00:23:14.821 --> 00:23:14.821
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>

413
00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:17.050
<v Speaker 1>Thus they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not me,</v>

414
00:23:17.051 --> 00:23:22.051
<v Speaker 1>not Paul stamets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a demonstration of cellular </v>

415
00:23:22.051 --> 00:23:25.021
<v Speaker 1>intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is the tip of the proverbial </v>

416
00:23:25.021 --> 00:23:25.021
<v Speaker 1>mycelial iceberg.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

417
00:23:25.030 --> 00:23:30.030
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has broad implications and I just </v>

418
00:23:30.030 --> 00:23:33.541
<v Speaker 1>want people to suspend their disbelief </v>
<v Speaker 1>and this goes into it actually,</v>

419
00:23:34.211 --> 00:23:39.211
<v Speaker 1>the evolution of human consciousness and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Terence Mckenna was a good friend of </v>

420
00:23:39.211 --> 00:23:40.150
<v Speaker 1>mine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love Terence.</v>

421
00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:45.240
<v Speaker 1>I especially love the last five years of</v>
<v Speaker 1>his life because he made fun of himself </v>

422
00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:48.511
<v Speaker 1>so much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Terence people took terence way too </v>

423
00:23:48.511 --> 00:23:50.120
<v Speaker 1>seriously in many levels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as his brother Dennis,</v>

424
00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:52.460
<v Speaker 1>which I think has been on your show a </v>
<v Speaker 1>couple times.</v>

425
00:23:52.461 --> 00:23:55.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a great ally,</v>

426
00:23:55.011 --> 00:23:56.570
<v Speaker 1>great scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

427
00:23:56.571 --> 00:24:01.571
<v Speaker 1>Dennis said even if 10 percent of what </v>
<v Speaker 1>terence said was true is frigging </v>

428
00:24:01.571 --> 00:24:05.920
<v Speaker 1>amazing and terence and Dennis both came</v>
<v Speaker 1>up with a stain stoned ape theory.</v>

429
00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:08.090
<v Speaker 1>Now it's not a theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a hypothesis.</v>

430
00:24:08.510 --> 00:24:13.510
<v Speaker 1>A hypothesis is speculative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but cannot necessarily be as not yet </v>

431
00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:17.561
<v Speaker 1>proven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A theory is a hypothesis that has been </v>

432
00:24:17.561 --> 00:24:20.621
<v Speaker 1>tested and proven with facts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I disagree with them and saying it's </v>

433
00:24:20.621 --> 00:24:20.621
<v Speaker 1>not a theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a hypothesis,</v>

434
00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:24.920
<v Speaker 1>but the hypothesis of the stone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a part of the stoned ape,</v>

435
00:24:24.921 --> 00:24:29.921
<v Speaker 1>which I think you've alluded to before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that with climate change and as the </v>

436
00:24:29.921 --> 00:24:33.971
<v Speaker 1>savannas increased and our primate </v>
<v Speaker 1>ancestors came out of the forest </v>

437
00:24:33.971 --> 00:24:38.231
<v Speaker 1>canopies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are tracking across the Savanna </v>

438
00:24:38.231 --> 00:24:38.231
<v Speaker 1>and if you're a hunter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you look?</v>

439
00:24:38.231 --> 00:24:39.240
<v Speaker 1>You look for footsteps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

440
00:24:39.241 --> 00:24:44.241
<v Speaker 1>look for Scott and the most significant </v>
<v Speaker 1>fleshy mushroom going out of poop in </v>

441
00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:48.290
<v Speaker 1>Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hippopotamus,</v>

442
00:24:48.291 --> 00:24:50.600
<v Speaker 1>elephant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deer,</v>

443
00:24:50.601 --> 00:24:51.660
<v Speaker 1>antelope,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>

444
00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:55.910
<v Speaker 1>His last big events,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a very large mushroom.</v>

445
00:24:55.940 --> 00:24:58.010
<v Speaker 1>You're hungry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're with your clan,</v>

446
00:24:58.670 --> 00:25:03.670
<v Speaker 1>you consume it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then 20 minutes later you are </v>

447
00:25:03.670 --> 00:25:06.170
<v Speaker 1>catapulted in this extraordinary </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>

448
00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:11.380
<v Speaker 1>Psilocybin substitutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as serotonin becomes a better </v>

449
00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:12.410
<v Speaker 1>neurotransmitter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>activates neurogenesis,</v>

450
00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:15.890
<v Speaker 1>it causes new neurons to form new </v>
<v Speaker 1>pathways of knowledge.</v>

451
00:25:16.220 --> 00:25:21.220
<v Speaker 1>So that's the stoned ape hypothesis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it speaks to a mystery that the </v>

452
00:25:22.071 --> 00:25:27.071
<v Speaker 1>human brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically the brain cavity doubled in </v>

453
00:25:27.071 --> 00:25:31.181
<v Speaker 1>size in about 2 million years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people say as less as to less than </v>

454
00:25:31.181 --> 00:25:32.600
<v Speaker 1>200,000,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Homo sapiens run 200,000</v>

455
00:25:32.601 --> 00:25:34.940
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Homo sapiens arrived at 200,000</v>

456
00:25:34.941 --> 00:25:35.900
<v Speaker 1>to 300,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>

457
00:25:35.901 --> 00:25:37.970
<v Speaker 1>It's a big gap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a big gamble,</v>

458
00:25:37.971 --> 00:25:42.971
<v Speaker 1>but science is like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you want to be scientifically </v>

459
00:25:42.971 --> 00:25:42.971
<v Speaker 1>accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here,</v>

460
00:25:42.971 --> 00:25:46.220
<v Speaker 1>I need to show the extreme margins of </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's been estimated,</v>

461
00:25:46.790 --> 00:25:51.650
<v Speaker 1>so we accept 2 million years that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>innocent shown in the fossil record.</v>

462
00:25:51.651 --> 00:25:56.651
<v Speaker 1>This is true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the oldest homo sapiens fossils are </v>

463
00:25:56.651 --> 00:25:56.651
<v Speaker 1>300,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years old now,</v>

464
00:25:56.660 --> 00:26:00.800
<v Speaker 1>but we have a subtle suddenly doubling </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the human brain.</v>

465
00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:06.760
<v Speaker 1>And with that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our language centers increased our </v>

466
00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:07.280
<v Speaker 1>ability to prognosticate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to plan,</v>

467
00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:12.290
<v Speaker 1>and there's no explanation for this </v>
<v Speaker 1>currently.</v>

468
00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:16.010
<v Speaker 1>And even though we may not be able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>prove it,</v>

469
00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:19.550
<v Speaker 1>I ask people to suspend their disbelief </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a second.</v>

470
00:26:20.030 --> 00:26:21.050
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think of this.</v>

471
00:26:21.890 --> 00:26:24.950
<v Speaker 1>Our primate ancestors are going across </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Savanna,</v>

472
00:26:25.250 --> 00:26:30.250
<v Speaker 1>the injustice mushrooms as a clan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>massive input for anyone's eaten.</v>

473
00:26:30.741 --> 00:26:33.530
<v Speaker 1>These mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>huge amounts of data's coming in,</v>

474
00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:37.310
<v Speaker 1>fractal patterns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Geometrical landscapes occur.</v>

475
00:26:38.780 --> 00:26:42.350
<v Speaker 1>You have empathy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have greater courage.</v>

476
00:26:42.351 --> 00:26:43.890
<v Speaker 1>You're fighting a saber,</v>
<v Speaker 1>save a saber,</v>

477
00:26:43.891 --> 00:26:44.970
<v Speaker 1>tooth tiger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

478
00:26:44.971 --> 00:26:49.971
<v Speaker 1>one day you have a fear of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know now from neurogenesis and the </v>

479
00:26:49.971 --> 00:26:52.350
<v Speaker 1>extinction of the fear response that has</v>
<v Speaker 1>been clinically proven.</v>

480
00:26:52.650 --> 00:26:57.650
<v Speaker 1>PSILOCYBIN allows you to re set and have</v>
<v Speaker 1>different neurological pathways to </v>

481
00:26:57.691 --> 00:26:59.840
<v Speaker 1>respond to fear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>overcoming the fear,</v>

482
00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:01.860
<v Speaker 1>conditioned response,</v>
<v Speaker 1>potentially ptsd.</v>

483
00:27:02.190 --> 00:27:04.710
<v Speaker 1>And there's a lot of research on this </v>
<v Speaker 1>currently so,</v>

484
00:27:04.711 --> 00:27:07.620
<v Speaker 1>but this one happened one time with one </v>
<v Speaker 1>hominid group.</v>

485
00:27:07.890 --> 00:27:10.470
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't happen two times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 times it happened,</v>

486
00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:15.560
<v Speaker 1>millions and millions and millions and </v>
<v Speaker 1>millions of times over millions and </v>

487
00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:17.460
<v Speaker 1>millions of years.</v>

488
00:27:17.670 --> 00:27:22.670
<v Speaker 1>This leads to what I think is called,</v>
<v Speaker 1>should be called epigenetic </v>

489
00:27:22.670 --> 00:27:23.850
<v Speaker 1>neurogenesis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know that there was a regeneration of</v>

490
00:27:23.851 --> 00:27:28.851
<v Speaker 1>neurons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know that psilocybin substitutes as </v>

491
00:27:28.851 --> 00:27:29.030
<v Speaker 1>Serotonin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it opens the floodgates of the senses.</v>

492
00:27:29.050 --> 00:27:34.050
<v Speaker 1>You have a lot more data coming in and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we know that he has extinction of the </v>

493
00:27:34.050 --> 00:27:35.670
<v Speaker 1>fear response,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you're the leader of your clan,</v>

494
00:27:35.970 --> 00:27:40.970
<v Speaker 1>you've had this traumatic event,</v>
<v Speaker 1>either war or cataclysm from </v>

495
00:27:41.370 --> 00:27:42.840
<v Speaker 1>earthquakes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever the case may be,</v>

496
00:27:42.841 --> 00:27:44.760
<v Speaker 1>or encounter a saber,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tooth tiger,</v>

497
00:27:44.790 --> 00:27:49.790
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're the leader of that clan and </v>

498
00:27:49.790 --> 00:27:53.040
<v Speaker 1>you can overcome your fear response,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have courage and you have empathy.</v>

499
00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:57.840
<v Speaker 1>Those are leadership skills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we'd be able to take note of it.</v>

500
00:27:58.770 --> 00:28:03.770
<v Speaker 1>People like to fall leaders who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>courageous and yet kind who they can </v>

501
00:28:03.770 --> 00:28:08.541
<v Speaker 1>trust,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll have their best interests in </v>

502
00:28:08.541 --> 00:28:08.541
<v Speaker 1>mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think this propelled,</v>

503
00:28:08.541 --> 00:28:10.440
<v Speaker 1>I think as a lot is a very good </v>
<v Speaker 1>explanation.</v>

504
00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:15.440
<v Speaker 1>It's an unprovable hypothesis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now we're at a junction for the net </v>

505
00:28:15.570 --> 00:28:18.180
<v Speaker 1>and we're ready for the next quantum </v>
<v Speaker 1>leap in human consciousness.</v>

506
00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:23.660
<v Speaker 1>I think psilocybin should be looked upon</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a nootropic vitamin and there's a </v>

507
00:28:23.660 --> 00:28:26.010
<v Speaker 1>huge amount of interest in this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Johns Hopkins University,</v>

508
00:28:26.011 --> 00:28:28.380
<v Speaker 1>as you probably well know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>New York University,</v>

509
00:28:28.381 --> 00:28:30.420
<v Speaker 1>Ucla,</v>
<v Speaker 1>elsewhere in Europe,</v>

510
00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:35.600
<v Speaker 1>there's major clinical studies that have</v>
<v Speaker 1>been conducted in the past two years </v>

511
00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:37.950
<v Speaker 1>showing exactly what I'm saying about </v>
<v Speaker 1>overcoming fear response,</v>

512
00:28:38.190 --> 00:28:40.860
<v Speaker 1>neurogenesis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>overcoming ptsd.</v>

513
00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:46.220
<v Speaker 1>This is now medically quite seriously </v>
<v Speaker 1>considered and something that I think </v>

514
00:28:46.951 --> 00:28:49.650
<v Speaker 1>that we should explore under controlled </v>
<v Speaker 1>settings.</v>

515
00:28:49.651 --> 00:28:52.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm not into partying with psilocybin </v>
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms,</v>

516
00:28:54.930 --> 00:28:59.930
<v Speaker 1>so good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can understand that fear is going to </v>

517
00:29:00.691 --> 00:29:03.970
<v Speaker 1>be here in an hour and a half and he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>the creator of shroom fest.</v>

518
00:29:04.270 --> 00:29:06.990
<v Speaker 1>He's going to be very upset with your </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea that you shouldn't party with it.</v>

519
00:29:07.710 --> 00:29:12.710
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's greater benefit and </v>

520
00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:12.810
<v Speaker 1>humanity.</v>

521
00:29:12.810 --> 00:29:16.230
<v Speaker 1>I think these are serious tools.</v>
<v Speaker 1>California has it.</v>

522
00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:18.280
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you probably aware.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

523
00:29:18.390 --> 00:29:21.780
<v Speaker 1>There it's up for legalization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

524
00:29:21.781 --> 00:29:25.720
<v Speaker 1>I was really quite surprised by that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

525
00:29:25.820 --> 00:29:27.710
<v Speaker 1>All my work and to put some caveats </v>
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

526
00:29:27.711 --> 00:29:32.711
<v Speaker 1>I was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All my work is covered by a drug </v>

527
00:29:32.711 --> 00:29:34.371
<v Speaker 1>enforcement administration license.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've published now four new species in </v>

528
00:29:34.371 --> 00:29:37.761
<v Speaker 1>the genus philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including the most potent psilocybin </v>

529
00:29:37.761 --> 00:29:37.761
<v Speaker 1>mushroom in the world called philosophy </v>
<v Speaker 1>as residents,</v>

530
00:29:38.190 --> 00:29:39.210
<v Speaker 1>and to be clear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>folks,</v>

531
00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:40.500
<v Speaker 1>nature provides.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

532
00:29:40.810 --> 00:29:45.810
<v Speaker 1>so I had my dea license,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean everyone I suspected was a dea </v>

533
00:29:45.810 --> 00:29:50.041
<v Speaker 1>agent who came to me and wanted to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>some psilocybin but probably got set up </v>

534
00:29:50.041 --> 00:29:52.650
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>numerous times at all.</v>

535
00:29:52.820 --> 00:29:53.740
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

536
00:29:53.770 --> 00:29:55.600
<v Speaker 1>was it a point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was pretty funny.</v>

537
00:29:55.601 --> 00:30:00.601
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had this one person that offered me </v>

538
00:30:00.601 --> 00:30:00.670
<v Speaker 1>just huge amounts of money and I played </v>
<v Speaker 1>with them and I said,</v>

539
00:30:00.671 --> 00:30:01.450
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not enough.</v>

540
00:30:01.450 --> 00:30:04.030
<v Speaker 1>And he offered me more and more money </v>
<v Speaker 1>presented with 200,</v>

541
00:30:04.031 --> 00:30:09.031
<v Speaker 1>$300,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he and he was writing all these </v>

542
00:30:09.031 --> 00:30:12.390
<v Speaker 1>coded letters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really obviously a dea agent trying to </v>

543
00:30:12.390 --> 00:30:15.751
<v Speaker 1>set me up and finally got really </v>
<v Speaker 1>frustrated because I was playing with a </v>

544
00:30:15.751 --> 00:30:15.751
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

545
00:30:15.751 --> 00:30:16.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm tired of being set up like this.</v>

546
00:30:16.271 --> 00:30:17.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm just gonna play with a Sucker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

547
00:30:18.070 --> 00:30:22.360
<v Speaker 1>And so it finally came to a point and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got really,</v>

548
00:30:22.361 --> 00:30:23.740
<v Speaker 1>really frustrated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't get mad at me.</v>

549
00:30:23.741 --> 00:30:24.120
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

550
00:30:24.130 --> 00:30:29.130
<v Speaker 1>how much money I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's not enough money on this planet </v>

551
00:30:29.130 --> 00:30:30.370
<v Speaker 1>for me to ever give you a soulless Ivan </v>
<v Speaker 1>mushroom.</v>

552
00:30:30.371 --> 00:30:32.500
<v Speaker 1>So give it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

553
00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:38.100
<v Speaker 1>But if you say that's not enough money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could that be taken as a negotiation?</v>

554
00:30:39.250 --> 00:30:40.540
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not enough money on the planet.</v>

555
00:30:40.570 --> 00:30:41.610
<v Speaker 1>I suppose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some aliens,</v>

556
00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:45.040
<v Speaker 1>not enough money on the planet for not </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough money.</v>

557
00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:47.290
<v Speaker 1>It was not enough money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right before that goes,</v>

558
00:30:47.420 --> 00:30:52.420
<v Speaker 1>is telling you that like if you had like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a really loosely interpreting judge you </v>

559
00:30:55.740 --> 00:30:57.580
<v Speaker 1>I suppose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I never committed a criminal act.</v>

560
00:30:57.790 --> 00:31:01.720
<v Speaker 1>So isn't it sort of like a conspiracy </v>
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

561
00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:03.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a lawyer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't have.</v>

562
00:31:03.431 --> 00:31:05.350
<v Speaker 1>I mean you have to keep things in </v>
<v Speaker 1>context.</v>

563
00:31:06.010 --> 00:31:08.950
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you're more courageous person when</v>

564
00:31:08.951 --> 00:31:13.951
<v Speaker 1>it comes to that stuff than me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well at some point I just got frankly </v>

565
00:31:13.951 --> 00:31:15.550
<v Speaker 1>pissed off and I'm playing with waste of</v>
<v Speaker 1>your time.</v>

566
00:31:15.551 --> 00:31:17.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to play with you and I'm going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to reverse the tables.</v>

567
00:31:17.521 --> 00:31:18.550
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in any event,</v>

568
00:31:18.580 --> 00:31:22.810
<v Speaker 1>this is serious research and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that unfortunately,</v>

569
00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:28.080
<v Speaker 1>because it can be marginalized by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>party atmosphere and used as a party </v>

570
00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:30.220
<v Speaker 1>drug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a really amazing study that just</v>

571
00:31:30.221 --> 00:31:35.221
<v Speaker 1>came out about five days ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a big data study.</v>

572
00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:40.680
<v Speaker 1>Four hundred and 40,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

573
00:31:41.470 --> 00:31:46.470
<v Speaker 1>Prisoners were surveyed over 10 years </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the Department of Human and health </v>

574
00:31:46.470 --> 00:31:51.211
<v Speaker 1>services data bank,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they found an amazing correlation if</v>

575
00:31:51.761 --> 00:31:54.100
<v Speaker 1>you had in this patient and this </v>
<v Speaker 1>prisoners,</v>

576
00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:57.700
<v Speaker 1>one experience with psilocybin in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>

577
00:31:58.150 --> 00:32:03.150
<v Speaker 1>one experience it reduced in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>population compared to the people who </v>

578
00:32:03.641 --> 00:32:08.641
<v Speaker 1>did not take psilocybin mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an 18 percent reduction in burglary and </v>

579
00:32:09.611 --> 00:32:14.611
<v Speaker 1>larceny and up to a 27 percent reduction</v>
<v Speaker 1>in other crimes including violent </v>

580
00:32:15.281 --> 00:32:17.620
<v Speaker 1>crimes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that phenomenal.</v>

581
00:32:17.621 --> 00:32:20.830
<v Speaker 1>I actually got my numbers reversed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is 27 percent reduction in burglary.</v>

582
00:32:21.010 --> 00:32:23.140
<v Speaker 1>Eighteen percent reduction in violent </v>
<v Speaker 1>crime.</v>

583
00:32:23.350 --> 00:32:28.350
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think of the damage not only to the </v>

584
00:32:28.350 --> 00:32:29.110
<v Speaker 1>victims and the victims' families,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the court system,</v>

585
00:32:29.111 --> 00:32:30.910
<v Speaker 1>the lawyers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the collateral damage,</v>

586
00:32:30.940 --> 00:32:35.940
<v Speaker 1>people being upset because they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>being criminalized in prison for </v>

587
00:32:35.940 --> 00:32:40.111
<v Speaker 1>something you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for merely possessing psilocybin </v>

588
00:32:40.111 --> 00:32:41.840
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But think of the return on investment of</v>

589
00:32:41.841 --> 00:32:46.841
<v Speaker 1>four to six hour experience creates a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lifetime benefit to society.</v>

590
00:32:47.450 --> 00:32:52.130
<v Speaker 1>Reducing criminal activity by 18 to 27 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent.</v>

591
00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:58.660
<v Speaker 1>This is phenomenal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is that this is something that can </v>

592
00:32:58.660 --> 00:33:00.140
<v Speaker 1>help the health of our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of our human psyche,</v>

593
00:33:00.141 --> 00:33:02.120
<v Speaker 1>our of our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of our social system,</v>

594
00:33:02.420 --> 00:33:05.990
<v Speaker 1>of reducing trauma throughout our entire</v>
<v Speaker 1>society.</v>

595
00:33:06.410 --> 00:33:11.410
<v Speaker 1>It's time for us to wake up and look at </v>
<v Speaker 1>this at a much more seasoned and </v>

596
00:33:12.531 --> 00:33:15.620
<v Speaker 1>intellectual fashion than we have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>rational</v>

597
00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:18.900
<v Speaker 2>not weighed down by the ideas of </v>
<v Speaker 2>mushrooms being a silly thing</v>

598
00:33:19.380 --> 00:33:24.380
<v Speaker 1>and so I mean I have a few pet peeves </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I understand why people want to use,</v>

599
00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:27.960
<v Speaker 1>but the word shroom just drives me </v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>

600
00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:33.020
<v Speaker 1>Shroom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fast strand this room fastest with all </v>

601
00:33:33.020 --> 00:33:33.420
<v Speaker 1>due respect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand,</v>

602
00:33:33.890 --> 00:33:36.660
<v Speaker 1>but let's not be children about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's be adults.</v>

603
00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:38.490
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a serious person.</v>

604
00:33:38.730 --> 00:33:39.340
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

605
00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:42.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm also in a non serious person on many</v>
<v Speaker 1>levels,</v>

606
00:33:42.421 --> 00:33:47.421
<v Speaker 1>but I know when it comes to something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is so powerful that is so </v>

607
00:33:47.421 --> 00:33:51.051
<v Speaker 1>important,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's not jeopardize its use medically </v>

608
00:33:51.051 --> 00:33:55.131
<v Speaker 1>and the benefit society in the future by</v>
<v Speaker 1>appealing to the lowest common </v>

609
00:33:55.131 --> 00:33:56.460
<v Speaker 1>denominator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's be adults in the room on this.</v>

610
00:33:56.540 --> 00:34:01.540
<v Speaker 2>I agree with you to a certain extent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I also think that it's got to be </v>

611
00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:05.651
<v Speaker 2>incredibly frustrating for a guy like </v>
<v Speaker 2>you that has the kind of information </v>

612
00:34:05.651 --> 00:34:08.651
<v Speaker 2>that you have bouncing around your head </v>
<v Speaker 2>in relationship to the rest of the </v>

613
00:34:08.651 --> 00:34:08.651
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Views it.</v>

614
00:34:08.651 --> 00:34:12.170
<v Speaker 2>See to a person like myself who I don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>know nearly as much as you know,</v>

615
00:34:12.171 --> 00:34:17.171
<v Speaker 2>but I know quite a bit more than the </v>
<v Speaker 2>average person when it comes to </v>

616
00:34:17.171 --> 00:34:19.190
<v Speaker 2>psilocybin and mushrooms or Amanita </v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] or Terence Mckenna's ideas.</v>

617
00:34:19.970 --> 00:34:24.970
<v Speaker 2>Shroom fest doesn't bother me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for a serious researcher like </v>

618
00:34:24.970 --> 00:34:24.970
<v Speaker 2>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's got to be like,</v>

619
00:34:24.970 --> 00:34:26.870
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a part of the problem.</v>

620
00:34:27.020 --> 00:34:27.660
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

621
00:34:27.740 --> 00:34:28.740
<v Speaker 2>it's naked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's silly.</v>

622
00:34:28.850 --> 00:34:30.630
<v Speaker 2>Is that Timothy leary problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

623
00:34:30.740 --> 00:34:31.050
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

624
00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:34.370
<v Speaker 1>It held back the bonafide research in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this subject for years.</v>

625
00:34:34.700 --> 00:34:36.560
<v Speaker 1>There's a movement right now in that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please.</v>

626
00:34:36.660 --> 00:34:41.660
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a movement right now to move </v>

627
00:34:41.660 --> 00:34:41.660
<v Speaker 1>psilocybin from schedule one to schedule</v>
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

628
00:34:41.660 --> 00:34:43.670
<v Speaker 1>schedule one illegal drug that has no </v>
<v Speaker 1>medical benefits.</v>

629
00:34:43.700 --> 00:34:46.430
<v Speaker 1>Schedule two means it's a drug that has </v>
<v Speaker 1>medical benefits,</v>

630
00:34:46.820 --> 00:34:51.820
<v Speaker 1>so there's a serious movement going on </v>
<v Speaker 1>right now within the FDA to have it be </v>

631
00:34:52.731 --> 00:34:57.731
<v Speaker 1>recategorized because in the words of </v>
<v Speaker 1>FDA researchers,</v>

632
00:34:57.741 --> 00:35:02.741
<v Speaker 1>I know one arm's length removed is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they've never seen anything with such a </v>

633
00:35:02.741 --> 00:35:07.031
<v Speaker 1>strong safety profile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They give so much benefit at so little </v>

634
00:35:07.031 --> 00:35:10.361
<v Speaker 1>cost for such a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a drug in a category of its own.</v>

635
00:35:14.390 --> 00:35:17.980
<v Speaker 1>This is really important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's not jeopardize it.</v>

636
00:35:18.170 --> 00:35:20.540
<v Speaker 1>It is really important,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're never going to stop kids from</v>

637
00:35:20.541 --> 00:35:21.560
<v Speaker 1>calling a truce.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

638
00:35:21.950 --> 00:35:24.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I want to give a pass here.</v>

639
00:35:24.380 --> 00:35:26.510
<v Speaker 1>I want to get a pass and the coming of </v>
<v Speaker 1>age,</v>

640
00:35:26.530 --> 00:35:31.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was 16 to the age 20 to 24,</v>

641
00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:36.280
<v Speaker 1>it's the coming of age ceremony.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm going to tell you something </v>

642
00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:39.071
<v Speaker 1>that's very deeply personal and very </v>
<v Speaker 1>significant in my life.</v>

643
00:35:40.410 --> 00:35:44.670
<v Speaker 1>I had a congenital stuttering habit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could not speak.</v>

644
00:35:45.090 --> 00:35:48.450
<v Speaker 1>I could not look at Joe Rogan in the eye</v>
<v Speaker 1>right now without,</v>

645
00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:51.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had like the king's speech.</v>

646
00:35:51.481 --> 00:35:54.780
<v Speaker 1>You've seen the movie exactly like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but worse.</v>

647
00:35:54.870 --> 00:35:59.870
<v Speaker 1>In my case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went through six years of speech </v>

648
00:35:59.870 --> 00:36:01.470
<v Speaker 1>therapy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was interviewed for special education.</v>

649
00:36:01.471 --> 00:36:03.510
<v Speaker 1>I grew up in a small town called </v>
<v Speaker 1>Columbiana,</v>

650
00:36:03.511 --> 00:36:08.511
<v Speaker 1>Ohio and I could not speak now the type </v>
<v Speaker 1>of stuttering habit that I have and had.</v>

651
00:36:09.930 --> 00:36:13.800
<v Speaker 1>I don't stutter to animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had pet snapping turtles and I haven't</v>

652
00:36:13.801 --> 00:36:16.540
<v Speaker 1>talked to him all the time and I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>stutter when I sing,</v>

653
00:36:17.190 --> 00:36:22.190
<v Speaker 1>but I could not elocute without </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuttering constantly and please people </v>

654
00:36:22.201 --> 00:36:24.930
<v Speaker 1>out there don't finish a stutterers </v>
<v Speaker 1>sentence.</v>

655
00:36:25.540 --> 00:36:30.540
<v Speaker 1>The type of stutterer category that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>have been in is that we would try to </v>

656
00:36:31.111 --> 00:36:36.111
<v Speaker 1>trick our brain with a prepositional or </v>
<v Speaker 1>adverbial phrase halfway through the </v>

657
00:36:36.111 --> 00:36:40.971
<v Speaker 1>sentence that we're stuck on because </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're thinking three or four sentences </v>

658
00:36:40.971 --> 00:36:41.100
<v Speaker 1>ahead and the only way you can do is </v>
<v Speaker 1>trick the brain.</v>

659
00:36:41.370 --> 00:36:46.370
<v Speaker 1>So I had to come up with a new </v>
<v Speaker 1>neurological pathway to trick my brain </v>

660
00:36:46.370 --> 00:36:47.010
<v Speaker 1>so I could get out of my stuttering </v>
<v Speaker 1>rhythm.</v>

661
00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:49.280
<v Speaker 1>That was just repetition I couldn't get </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of.</v>

662
00:36:50.340 --> 00:36:54.270
<v Speaker 1>And then in one day before I ever had </v>
<v Speaker 1>psilocybin mushrooms,</v>

663
00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:58.680
<v Speaker 1>I bought some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bag of them and I thought I got,</v>

664
00:36:58.710 --> 00:37:02.370
<v Speaker 1>I had no information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just bought the bag for about 25 bucks</v>

665
00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:07.700
<v Speaker 1>and I went out for a walk in the woods </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Ohio and there was a beautiful oak </v>

666
00:37:09.331 --> 00:37:13.170
<v Speaker 1>tree that I used to climb the top of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>very top of the tallest hill in Ohio.</v>

667
00:37:13.170 --> 00:37:16.740
<v Speaker 1>We don't have mountains,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have hills and it isn't a summertime.</v>

668
00:37:16.741 --> 00:37:18.990
<v Speaker 1>And so I thought set and setting is </v>
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>

669
00:37:18.991 --> 00:37:22.710
<v Speaker 1>I knew that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I went for a walk and I ate the bag,</v>

670
00:37:23.220 --> 00:37:26.010
<v Speaker 1>the whole bag when I was walking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many announcers you think?</v>

671
00:37:26.100 --> 00:37:27.090
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was about.</v>

672
00:37:27.091 --> 00:37:29.040
<v Speaker 1>I know it was about a half an ounce to </v>
<v Speaker 1>an ounce.</v>

673
00:37:29.041 --> 00:37:30.620
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're,</v>

674
00:37:30.690 --> 00:37:32.030
<v Speaker 1>we're talking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

675
00:37:32.370 --> 00:37:37.370
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the elevator ride beyond the </v>

676
00:37:37.370 --> 00:37:39.741
<v Speaker 1>10th floor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So eight to 16 grams is probably on the </v>

677
00:37:39.741 --> 00:37:40.120
<v Speaker 1>order,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about 20 grand,</v>

678
00:37:40.410 --> 00:37:42.050
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

679
00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:45.270
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't know.</v>

680
00:37:45.271 --> 00:37:46.080
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had no one to.</v>

681
00:37:46.650 --> 00:37:48.780
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I knew that I went to this.</v>

682
00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:50.520
<v Speaker 1>I want to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My destination was this tree.</v>

683
00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:56.270
<v Speaker 1>So I walked and walked and I came at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>tree and I was eating the mushrooms and </v>

684
00:37:56.270 --> 00:38:00.980
<v Speaker 1>then I started feeling the effects and </v>
<v Speaker 1>so it was great because I was climbing </v>

685
00:38:00.980 --> 00:38:01.740
<v Speaker 1>the tree and I was getting higher in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>tree and higher in my brain.</v>

686
00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:04.200
<v Speaker 1>Well that seems like a terrible thing to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

687
00:38:04.260 --> 00:38:07.680
<v Speaker 1>And I climbed to the top of the tree and</v>
<v Speaker 1>this beautiful landscape.</v>

688
00:38:07.681 --> 00:38:09.750
<v Speaker 1>But it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was the summertime,</v>

689
00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:11.850
<v Speaker 1>these boiling black clouds in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>horizon.</v>

690
00:38:11.851 --> 00:38:12.270
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

691
00:38:12.300 --> 00:38:13.520
<v Speaker 1>that's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

692
00:38:13.540 --> 00:38:17.010
<v Speaker 1>And so this big summer storm was coming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

693
00:38:17.410 --> 00:38:22.410
<v Speaker 1>the clouds were dark and boiling and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're coming close and I could </v>

694
00:38:22.410 --> 00:38:26.841
<v Speaker 1>hear the thunder and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I'm going to higher and higher </v>

695
00:38:26.841 --> 00:38:30.021
<v Speaker 1>and the winds pick up and the tree </v>
<v Speaker 1>started moving and I started getting </v>

696
00:38:30.021 --> 00:38:30.021
<v Speaker 1>vertigo because I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

697
00:38:30.021 --> 00:38:31.740
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting so freaking high on these </v>
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms.</v>

698
00:38:32.190 --> 00:38:37.190
<v Speaker 1>And so I grabbed the tree and held on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the tree and it became my axis Mundi </v>

699
00:38:37.190 --> 00:38:40.621
<v Speaker 1>into the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the lightning started coming </v>

700
00:38:40.621 --> 00:38:40.621
<v Speaker 1>closer and then lightning strikes </v>
<v Speaker 1>started.</v>

701
00:38:40.621 --> 00:38:45.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm really close and the lightning would</v>
<v Speaker 1>hit and I saw fractals for the first </v>

702
00:38:45.330 --> 00:38:47.800
<v Speaker 1>time the atmosphere became liquid.</v>

703
00:38:48.010 --> 00:38:53.010
<v Speaker 1>I saw this liquid waves of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>multidimensional geometrical patterns </v>

704
00:38:53.010 --> 00:38:56.761
<v Speaker 1>everywhere and the sparks of lightning </v>
<v Speaker 1>would just create these amazing </v>

705
00:38:56.761 --> 00:39:00.391
<v Speaker 1>crescendos of secondary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tertiary fractals all around me and I </v>

706
00:39:00.491 --> 00:39:01.100
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my.</v>

707
00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:02.140
<v Speaker 1>It was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

708
00:39:02.141 --> 00:39:07.141
<v Speaker 1>this is what I read about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the storm came and lightning strikes </v>

709
00:39:07.141 --> 00:39:11.851
<v Speaker 1>are all around me and I was washed with </v>
<v Speaker 1>rain ends up there and I felt I felt in </v>

710
00:39:11.851 --> 00:39:12.880
<v Speaker 1>touch with Gaia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the universe.</v>

711
00:39:12.881 --> 00:39:16.000
<v Speaker 1>My heart opened up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt one with all.</v>

712
00:39:16.330 --> 00:39:17.380
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my gosh,</v>

713
00:39:17.381 --> 00:39:19.600
<v Speaker 1>this is such a powerful spiritual </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>

714
00:39:19.601 --> 00:39:22.930
<v Speaker 1>I had no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No matter what anyone has read,</v>

715
00:39:22.931 --> 00:39:25.630
<v Speaker 1>as you probably know it cannot describe </v>
<v Speaker 1>the experience,</v>

716
00:39:26.190 --> 00:39:27.910
<v Speaker 1>and then it dawned on me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a second,</v>

717
00:39:27.911 --> 00:39:32.911
<v Speaker 1>stamets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in the tallest tree on the </v>

718
00:39:32.911 --> 00:39:33.250
<v Speaker 1>tallest hill for miles in the middle of </v>
<v Speaker 1>a lightning storm.</v>

719
00:39:33.700 --> 00:39:38.700
<v Speaker 1>This is not the best place to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so I realized I could be killed up </v>

720
00:39:38.891 --> 00:39:39.190
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

721
00:39:39.250 --> 00:39:43.990
<v Speaker 1>Suddenly I had a reality rush,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you could turn into a god.</v>

722
00:39:45.460 --> 00:39:49.780
<v Speaker 1>Imagine like Comic Book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twenty Grams of mushrooms,</v>

723
00:39:49.990 --> 00:39:54.990
<v Speaker 1>hugging a tree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lightning comes and hits you and </v>

724
00:39:54.990 --> 00:39:57.250
<v Speaker 1>maybe you were the savior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you need to get back to that tree.</v>

725
00:39:58.510 --> 00:40:03.510
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you're the chosen one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I thought it was an incredibly </v>

726
00:40:05.111 --> 00:40:08.830
<v Speaker 1>spiritual and wonderful experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I also had the fear,</v>

727
00:40:08.890 --> 00:40:11.170
<v Speaker 1>and this comes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes with the hero's journey,</v>

728
00:40:11.460 --> 00:40:14.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you always have the dark side.</v>

729
00:40:14.291 --> 00:40:17.900
<v Speaker 1>He always have not just the light side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's counterbalanced the dark side.</v>

730
00:40:18.350 --> 00:40:19.780
<v Speaker 1>Then I realized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my gosh,</v>

731
00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:21.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could die up here and said,</v>

732
00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:23.110
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't die stamets,</v>

733
00:40:23.130 --> 00:40:25.150
<v Speaker 1>which were your issues?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

734
00:40:25.180 --> 00:40:27.100
<v Speaker 1>this gets something out of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>

735
00:40:27.101 --> 00:40:32.101
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this stuttering habits ridiculous and </v>

736
00:40:32.101 --> 00:40:34.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm not stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I said to myself,</v>

737
00:40:34.571 --> 00:40:37.930
<v Speaker 1>stop stuttering now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stop Stuttering now.</v>

738
00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:42.430
<v Speaker 1>I said that dozens hundreds of times </v>
<v Speaker 1>over and over and over,</v>

739
00:40:42.431 --> 00:40:47.431
<v Speaker 1>and fortunately the storms went past and</v>
<v Speaker 1>held onto the tree and soaking wet.</v>

740
00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:52.980
<v Speaker 1>I came out of the tree and walked back </v>
<v Speaker 1>to where I was living in the next day I </v>

741
00:40:54.490 --> 00:40:59.490
<v Speaker 1>got up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't see anybody and I was walking </v>

742
00:40:59.490 --> 00:41:01.681
<v Speaker 1>on on on this path and sidewalk and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lady that I really liked a </v>

743
00:41:01.681 --> 00:41:06.031
<v Speaker 1>lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she was always attracted to the </v>

744
00:41:06.031 --> 00:41:06.100
<v Speaker 1>super self assured jocks and things like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

745
00:41:06.101 --> 00:41:11.101
<v Speaker 1>She was actually very kind and sweet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't want to stare at her in the</v>

746
00:41:11.351 --> 00:41:15.220
<v Speaker 1>eyes because I would stutter and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>humiliating for us,</v>

747
00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:18.400
<v Speaker 1>so the more humiliating us stutterers </v>
<v Speaker 1>feel,</v>

748
00:41:18.820 --> 00:41:23.820
<v Speaker 1>the more we stutter and so it's a really</v>
<v Speaker 1>slippery slope and so I would avoid eye </v>

749
00:41:23.981 --> 00:41:28.700
<v Speaker 1>contact and so for the first time she </v>
<v Speaker 1>walked towards him,</v>

750
00:41:28.701 --> 00:41:29.680
<v Speaker 1>he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good Morning Paul,</v>

751
00:41:29.681 --> 00:41:34.681
<v Speaker 1>how are you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was always so nice to me and I was </v>

752
00:41:34.681 --> 00:41:35.330
<v Speaker 1>terrified because embarrass myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I looked at her straight in the eyes</v>

753
00:41:35.580 --> 00:41:36.890
<v Speaker 1>and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing fine.</v>

754
00:41:36.890 --> 00:41:41.890
<v Speaker 1>How are you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I stopped stuttering in one day and </v>

755
00:41:41.890 --> 00:41:46.691
<v Speaker 1>this speaks to now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What has been medically proven is that </v>

756
00:41:46.691 --> 00:41:48.800
<v Speaker 1>we can reset the neurology of the human </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain through neurogenesis.</v>

757
00:41:49.130 --> 00:41:54.130
<v Speaker 1>I believe that experience allowed me to </v>
<v Speaker 1>map new neurological pathways that </v>

758
00:41:54.261 --> 00:41:57.170
<v Speaker 1>allows me to elocute in a way that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>could not elocute before.</v>

759
00:41:57.500 --> 00:42:00.740
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just to be truthful here,</v>

760
00:42:00.860 --> 00:42:05.860
<v Speaker 1>if I drink a lot of alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in a loud bar because us stutterers,</v>

761
00:42:06.130 --> 00:42:11.130
<v Speaker 1>you're a martial artist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been a martial artist all my life </v>

762
00:42:11.130 --> 00:42:13.130
<v Speaker 1>and we have peripheral consciousness and</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if someone comes through a door,</v>

763
00:42:13.330 --> 00:42:15.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the bar and I'm looking at you.</v>

764
00:42:15.291 --> 00:42:20.291
<v Speaker 1>I know that they've come through,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this hyper alertness that US martial </v>

765
00:42:20.291 --> 00:42:24.431
<v Speaker 1>artists have of knowing things in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>circumference around us in the </v>

766
00:42:24.431 --> 00:42:28.421
<v Speaker 1>peripheral environment is distracting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if I drink a lot and there's a loud,</v>

767
00:42:28.911 --> 00:42:31.700
<v Speaker 1>a loud noise and a lot of people coming </v>
<v Speaker 1>in and out of doors,</v>

768
00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:36.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm hypersensitive to intruders and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's when I'll start stuttering.</v>

769
00:42:36.980 --> 00:42:39.710
<v Speaker 1>If the person's talking to me asking me </v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you grow mushrooms?</v>

770
00:42:39.711 --> 00:42:44.711
<v Speaker 1>It's like filling a well with a teaspoon</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I'm worried about the guy who </v>

771
00:42:44.711 --> 00:42:47.801
<v Speaker 1>just came through the door over there </v>
<v Speaker 1>who looks like he may not be a safe </v>

772
00:42:47.801 --> 00:42:47.801
<v Speaker 1>person to be in this environment right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

773
00:42:48.140 --> 00:42:53.140
<v Speaker 1>So that there's a time that I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you only give 10 percent of my brain to </v>

774
00:42:53.151 --> 00:42:54.680
<v Speaker 1>communicating to the person in front of </v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

775
00:42:54.681 --> 00:42:58.820
<v Speaker 1>My 90 percent of my brain is hyper aware</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the circumstantial environment around</v>

776
00:42:58.821 --> 00:43:03.821
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>time for another trip to the tree to </v>

777
00:43:03.821 --> 00:43:03.821
<v Speaker 1>cure that last 10 percent.</v>

778
00:43:04.610 --> 00:43:09.610
<v Speaker 1>But that's my personal story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing and it's not going to </v>

779
00:43:09.610 --> 00:43:09.800
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it worked for you.</v>

780
00:43:09.830 --> 00:43:14.830
<v Speaker 1>That's what's important for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was at crater lake lodge and a </v>

781
00:43:14.830 --> 00:43:18.980
<v Speaker 1>waiter came up to me and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's about 17,</v>

782
00:43:18.981 --> 00:43:21.050
<v Speaker 1>18 years of age,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bus boy actually.</v>

783
00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:24.090
<v Speaker 1>And my wife and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my wife looked at me and I looked,</v>

784
00:43:24.350 --> 00:43:26.630
<v Speaker 1>looked at her and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>should I?</v>

785
00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:28.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go ahead.</v>

786
00:43:28.700 --> 00:43:31.340
<v Speaker 1>So I told her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I told this bus boy at the same story.</v>

787
00:43:31.341 --> 00:43:36.341
<v Speaker 1>Now this guy was totally straight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looked like it was a super conservative </v>

788
00:43:36.341 --> 00:43:37.850
<v Speaker 1>from a super conservative family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we told him this whole story and his</v>

789
00:43:37.851 --> 00:43:42.851
<v Speaker 1>eyes were wide open because when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>meet other stutterers and you talk to </v>

790
00:43:42.851 --> 00:43:43.010
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're really desperate for a solution.</v>

791
00:43:43.460 --> 00:43:45.920
<v Speaker 1>So I never knew what happened to this </v>
<v Speaker 1>young bus boy.</v>

792
00:43:45.921 --> 00:43:47.420
<v Speaker 1>But I think I changed his life forever.</v>

793
00:43:47.730 --> 00:43:52.730
<v Speaker 1>I hope you did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I had a good friend growing up and </v>

794
00:43:52.730 --> 00:43:55.301
<v Speaker 1>his brother was severely stricken with </v>
<v Speaker 1>it to the point where he would have to </v>

795
00:43:55.301 --> 00:43:59.080
<v Speaker 1>wince,</v>
<v Speaker 1>close his eyes and looked down and he </v>

796
00:43:59.080 --> 00:43:59.690
<v Speaker 1>would talk to you and he just couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>get over it.</v>

797
00:43:59.691 --> 00:44:02.810
<v Speaker 1>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he won't stutter to animals.</v>

798
00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:07.310
<v Speaker 1>It won't stutter when he sings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what do you think it is?</v>

799
00:44:07.311 --> 00:44:08.740
<v Speaker 1>Like what is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is happening?</v>

800
00:44:08.900 --> 00:44:10.940
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

801
00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:15.960
<v Speaker 1>there's several things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could be trauma when you're a child </v>

802
00:44:15.960 --> 00:44:18.191
<v Speaker 1>combined with neuropathy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was told by one psychiatrist who is a </v>

803
00:44:19.641 --> 00:44:24.530
<v Speaker 1>specialist in this at a conference that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there is a theory that in the seventh or</v>

804
00:44:24.531 --> 00:44:27.980
<v Speaker 1>eighth month in the womb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

805
00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:31.380
<v Speaker 1>your neurons failed to make all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>connections that it to.</v>

806
00:44:31.740 --> 00:44:36.740
<v Speaker 1>So that makes sense to me because why </v>
<v Speaker 1>would reroute with preposition </v>

807
00:44:36.740 --> 00:44:39.531
<v Speaker 1>preposition or adverbial phrases to try </v>
<v Speaker 1>to jump around the little habitual loop </v>

808
00:44:39.871 --> 00:44:40.240
<v Speaker 1>that I'm in.</v>

809
00:44:40.890 --> 00:44:45.450
<v Speaker 1>But I think this speaks to increasing </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence and we all will suffer from</v>

810
00:44:45.451 --> 00:44:48.900
<v Speaker 1>some form of dementia and neuropathy </v>
<v Speaker 1>occurs.</v>

811
00:44:49.830 --> 00:44:54.830
<v Speaker 1>There is a really wonderful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>safe and legal mushroom to use that at </v>

812
00:44:54.900 --> 00:44:57.300
<v Speaker 1>least in neurogenesis and that's called </v>
<v Speaker 1>lion's mane.</v>

813
00:44:57.750 --> 00:45:02.400
<v Speaker 1>And Lion's mane is a cascading white </v>
<v Speaker 1>icicle edible choice mushroom.</v>

814
00:45:02.401 --> 00:45:05.070
<v Speaker 1>They sell in the stores,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stores,</v>

815
00:45:05.640 --> 00:45:07.290
<v Speaker 1>grocery stores all over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

816
00:45:07.560 --> 00:45:08.610
<v Speaker 1>lion's Mane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're called,</v>

817
00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:10.800
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>various brand names.</v>

818
00:45:10.801 --> 00:45:14.430
<v Speaker 1>One I love is called pom Pom Blanc.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks like pom poms from cheerleaders</v>

819
00:45:15.030 --> 00:45:20.030
<v Speaker 1>and lion's mane contains a unique group </v>
<v Speaker 1>of compounds called rna scenes and </v>

820
00:45:21.790 --> 00:45:26.700
<v Speaker 1>herbicide nuns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And these regenerate Myelin on the axons</v>

821
00:45:26.730 --> 00:45:31.730
<v Speaker 1>of nerves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so this is a mushroom [inaudible] </v>

822
00:45:31.730 --> 00:45:35.630
<v Speaker 1>discovered this in 1994,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Japanese researcher and he postulated </v>

823
00:45:35.630 --> 00:45:39.381
<v Speaker 1>it as a potential preventative or </v>
<v Speaker 1>treatment for Alzheimer's,</v>

824
00:45:39.690 --> 00:45:41.640
<v Speaker 1>muscular dystrophy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>etc.</v>

825
00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:44.660
<v Speaker 1>But do take it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I take it every day,</v>

826
00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:45.600
<v Speaker 1>every day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every day.</v>

827
00:45:45.630 --> 00:45:48.300
<v Speaker 1>Take it in raw form or I take it in </v>
<v Speaker 1>capsules.</v>

828
00:45:49.130 --> 00:45:50.490
<v Speaker 1>So you Buy it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

829
00:45:50.491 --> 00:45:53.580
<v Speaker 1>we have a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have an extensive product line.</v>

830
00:45:54.540 --> 00:45:58.710
<v Speaker 1>How do you get to that host defense.com,</v>
<v Speaker 1>host defense.com.</v>

831
00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:04.040
<v Speaker 1>Why host defense?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's part of your innate immunity </v>

832
00:46:04.040 --> 00:46:04.050
<v Speaker 1>response,</v>
<v Speaker 1>supporting your immunity.</v>

833
00:46:04.380 --> 00:46:09.300
<v Speaker 1>But our main business is@fungi.com.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I mentioned that many myself,</v>

834
00:46:09.301 --> 00:46:11.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm kind of proud of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It cost me 25 bucks.</v>

835
00:46:11.970 --> 00:46:13.470
<v Speaker 1>Nineteen 94.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

836
00:46:13.471 --> 00:46:17.910
<v Speaker 1>You were ahead of the ball so well </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself,</v>

837
00:46:17.940 --> 00:46:21.810
<v Speaker 1>but lIon's mane is a safe mushroom to </v>
<v Speaker 1>consume.</v>

838
00:46:21.990 --> 00:46:26.990
<v Speaker 1>There are several clinical studies out </v>
<v Speaker 1>on treating mild cognitive dysfunction,</v>

839
00:46:28.980 --> 00:46:32.850
<v Speaker 1>but there's two mouse studies that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think are quite illustrative and this is</v>

840
00:46:32.851 --> 00:46:35.880
<v Speaker 1>translational medicine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This translates from mice experiments to</v>

841
00:46:35.881 --> 00:46:40.881
<v Speaker 1>humans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We already know is that it has aspects </v>

842
00:46:40.881 --> 00:46:43.020
<v Speaker 1>of neurogenesis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you go into all zimmer,</v>

843
00:46:43.030 --> 00:46:45.210
<v Speaker 1>a state of alzheimer's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a bit complex,</v>

844
00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:48.930
<v Speaker 1>but one of the characteristics is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>formation of amyloid plaques.</v>

845
00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:53.100
<v Speaker 1>De myelination of the neurons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Myelin transmits the neural signals,</v>

846
00:46:53.130 --> 00:46:58.130
<v Speaker 1>demyelination occurs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your outer sheath on the neurons is </v>

847
00:46:58.290 --> 00:47:02.880
<v Speaker 1>interrupted by amyloid plaques that then</v>
<v Speaker 1>prevent neurotransmission.</v>

848
00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:07.800
<v Speaker 1>So the experiments with the mice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think are so interesting was one</v>

849
00:47:07.801 --> 00:47:12.801
<v Speaker 1>experiment was the the maze experiment </v>
<v Speaker 1>where the mice were put into an arena </v>

850
00:47:15.150 --> 00:47:20.150
<v Speaker 1>and they went out of the corridor and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they went one way in the corridor or </v>

851
00:47:20.150 --> 00:47:20.310
<v Speaker 1>they'd find food the other way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no food.</v>

852
00:47:20.340 --> 00:47:22.020
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very quickly the mice learned,</v>

853
00:47:22.330 --> 00:47:23.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go out the corridor,</v>

854
00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:25.410
<v Speaker 1>go to the left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you find food,</v>

855
00:47:25.950 --> 00:47:30.950
<v Speaker 1>they injected it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then with a toxic polypeptide that </v>

856
00:47:30.950 --> 00:47:33.160
<v Speaker 1>induces amyloid plaque formation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is a neurotoxin.</v>

857
00:47:33.730 --> 00:47:37.540
<v Speaker 1>very quickly after two weeks or so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mice developed neuropathy.</v>

858
00:47:38.380 --> 00:47:43.380
<v Speaker 1>They got confused.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They couldn't remember which way to go </v>

859
00:47:43.380 --> 00:47:44.980
<v Speaker 1>at randomized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Upon giving these mice again,</v>

860
00:47:44.981 --> 00:47:48.860
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms for a few weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they nearly read,</v>

861
00:47:48.910 --> 00:47:51.550
<v Speaker 1>normalized upon sacrificing the mice.</v>

862
00:47:51.790 --> 00:47:56.790
<v Speaker 1>And the first part of the experiment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they saw the amyloid plaques and the de </v>

863
00:47:56.790 --> 00:47:57.550
<v Speaker 1>myelination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second part of the experiment,</v>

864
00:47:57.580 --> 00:48:00.160
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another subset of mice,</v>

865
00:48:00.910 --> 00:48:05.140
<v Speaker 1>they found that the myelin regrew and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the amyloId plaque had resolved.</v>

866
00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:10.200
<v Speaker 1>this is postmortems by say 100 miles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're basically cutting their brains </v>

867
00:48:11.560 --> 00:48:14.470
<v Speaker 1>cutting off a representative sample is </v>
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice them.</v>

868
00:48:14.471 --> 00:48:15.190
<v Speaker 1>You determine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

869
00:48:15.191 --> 00:48:17.050
<v Speaker 1>that's representative of the population.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

870
00:48:17.051 --> 00:48:22.051
<v Speaker 1>the remaining population as alive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they fed them the mushrooms and they </v>

871
00:48:22.051 --> 00:48:23.800
<v Speaker 1>found that they regained neurological </v>
<v Speaker 1>function.</v>

872
00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:27.490
<v Speaker 1>The other experiment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I find is even more fun is,</v>

873
00:48:27.491 --> 00:48:29.800
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this was done in Japan.</v>

874
00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:35.400
<v Speaker 1>They put like 100 mice in an arena and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they put a toy in the middle of the </v>

875
00:48:35.861 --> 00:48:37.760
<v Speaker 1>cage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the mice got excited,</v>

876
00:48:37.761 --> 00:48:39.160
<v Speaker 1>they came up and sniffed it and smelled </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

877
00:48:39.161 --> 00:48:44.161
<v Speaker 1>and they got really excited and they sat</v>
<v Speaker 1>there with counters to measure the </v>

878
00:48:44.460 --> 00:48:47.620
<v Speaker 1>number of points of contact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many points of contact the mice have</v>

879
00:48:47.650 --> 00:48:50.200
<v Speaker 1>exploring a new toy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they got a really good baseline,</v>

880
00:48:50.201 --> 00:48:53.260
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of data points,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then did the same thing.</v>

881
00:48:53.290 --> 00:48:56.440
<v Speaker 1>Then they introduced thiS peptide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this neurotoxin,</v>

882
00:48:56.830 --> 00:48:59.860
<v Speaker 1>and the mice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then after awhile were uninterested,</v>

883
00:49:00.070 --> 00:49:02.530
<v Speaker 1>didn't have imagination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no curiosity.</v>

884
00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:04.720
<v Speaker 1>They put a new toy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were disinterested.</v>

885
00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:10.200
<v Speaker 1>They did the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now even their full blown dementia like </v>

886
00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:10.200
<v Speaker 1>symptoms gave them lion's mane </v>
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms,</v>

887
00:49:10.360 --> 00:49:13.120
<v Speaker 1>and after a few weeks where they put it </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a new toy,</v>

888
00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:16.120
<v Speaker 1>they came back to near normal levels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Upon sacrificing the mice,</v>

889
00:49:16.121 --> 00:49:21.121
<v Speaker 1>they found that the amyloid plaque had </v>
<v Speaker 1>resolved and myelin had regenerated and </v>

890
00:49:21.121 --> 00:49:23.680
<v Speaker 1>neurogenesis had occurred.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a smart mushroom.</v>

891
00:49:24.100 --> 00:49:25.510
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The tragedy that we face,</v>

892
00:49:25.511 --> 00:49:30.040
<v Speaker 1>I believe as a society is we have people</v>
<v Speaker 1>like yourself,</v>

893
00:49:30.490 --> 00:49:35.490
<v Speaker 1>people like me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're all going to suffer through </v>

894
00:49:35.490 --> 00:49:37.861
<v Speaker 1>neuropathy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a lifetime of a body intellect </v>

895
00:49:37.861 --> 00:49:38.110
<v Speaker 1>of knowledge that we're going to start </v>
<v Speaker 1>losing.</v>

896
00:49:38.620 --> 00:49:41.230
<v Speaker 1>So what is the loss to society of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>elders?</v>

897
00:49:41.231 --> 00:49:46.231
<v Speaker 1>Forgetting not remembering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think this is something that's </v>

898
00:49:46.231 --> 00:49:46.990
<v Speaker 1>reallY extraordinarily exciting.</v>

899
00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:50.890
<v Speaker 1>It's not patentable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the drug companies have no interest</v>

900
00:49:50.891 --> 00:49:55.891
<v Speaker 1>in this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is probably the number one </v>

901
00:49:55.891 --> 00:49:56.660
<v Speaker 1>thing that people can do in my mind to </v>
<v Speaker 1>present,</v>

902
00:49:57.260 --> 00:50:01.390
<v Speaker 1>to preserve cognitive function,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to expand it now,</v>

903
00:50:01.391 --> 00:50:06.391
<v Speaker 1>I personally would love to see it legal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to stack them both together,</v>

904
00:50:07.240 --> 00:50:11.830
<v Speaker 1>stacking psilocybin with lion's mane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that stacking thing and then</v>

905
00:50:11.831 --> 00:50:16.831
<v Speaker 1>combining it with vitamin d three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now by suggest vitamin d three niacin </v>

906
00:50:17.440 --> 00:50:19.660
<v Speaker 1>because those of you who've had a niacin</v>
<v Speaker 1>flush,</v>

907
00:50:19.860 --> 00:50:22.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>200 milligrams of niacin or more,</v>

908
00:50:22.900 --> 00:50:27.900
<v Speaker 1>you get red,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get itchy and neuropathy typically </v>

909
00:50:27.900 --> 00:50:31.381
<v Speaker 1>is presented at the fingertips at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>end of your toes and your fingers and </v>

910
00:50:31.381 --> 00:50:33.860
<v Speaker 1>your peripheral nervous system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you have neuropathy,</v>

911
00:50:33.890 --> 00:50:36.080
<v Speaker 1>the nerve endings begin to die </v>
<v Speaker 1>backwards,</v>

912
00:50:36.680 --> 00:50:41.680
<v Speaker 1>so my idea here is because there are </v>
<v Speaker 1>different receptors being activated by </v>

913
00:50:41.680 --> 00:50:43.910
<v Speaker 1>psilocybin than with the [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 1>from lion's mane.</v>

914
00:50:44.260 --> 00:50:48.770
<v Speaker 1>If you stack lion's mane with psilocybin</v>
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms with niacin.</v>

915
00:50:49.220 --> 00:50:54.220
<v Speaker 1>The advantages of this is hypothetical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is something I think is well </v>

916
00:50:54.220 --> 00:50:58.121
<v Speaker 1>worth testing is that niacin can help </v>
<v Speaker 1>drive the neurogenic benefits of </v>

917
00:50:58.121 --> 00:51:01.430
<v Speaker 1>psilocybin and aaron means to the end of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the peripheral nervous system.</v>

918
00:51:01.970 --> 00:51:03.970
<v Speaker 1>So we actually have a planning right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

919
00:51:03.980 --> 00:51:06.590
<v Speaker 1>clinical study in Oregon with lion's </v>
<v Speaker 1>mane mushrooms.</v>

920
00:51:07.340 --> 00:51:11.000
<v Speaker 1>The physicians who've looked at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>research which is robust,</v>

921
00:51:12.110 --> 00:51:15.800
<v Speaker 1>are convinced that it adds worthy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they have their own funding.</v>

922
00:51:15.801 --> 00:51:19.910
<v Speaker 1>So we're going to have 30 study is what </v>
<v Speaker 1>we hope to do,</v>

923
00:51:19.940 --> 00:51:22.790
<v Speaker 1>30 patients and we hope to begin that </v>
<v Speaker 1>study in the next year.</v>

924
00:51:23.300 --> 00:51:26.840
<v Speaker 1>It was phenomenal to see how that would </v>
<v Speaker 1>affect people with cte.</v>

925
00:51:27.110 --> 00:51:29.120
<v Speaker 1>People like football players,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boxers,</v>

926
00:51:29.300 --> 00:51:30.280
<v Speaker 1>people with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

927
00:51:30.770 --> 00:51:33.110
<v Speaker 1>across,</v>
<v Speaker 1>across the board.</v>

928
00:51:33.880 --> 00:51:38.880
<v Speaker 1>The benefits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is something that when you're </v>

929
00:51:38.880 --> 00:51:43.121
<v Speaker 1>depressed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not creative and your immune </v>

930
00:51:43.121 --> 00:51:46.481
<v Speaker 1>system is depressed as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're psychologically emotionally </v>

931
00:51:46.481 --> 00:51:48.020
<v Speaker 1>depressed and you're not as creative </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you are happy,</v>

932
00:51:48.021 --> 00:51:50.150
<v Speaker 1>you are creative and your immune system </v>
<v Speaker 1>is better.</v>

933
00:51:50.780 --> 00:51:55.340
<v Speaker 1>So this could be fundamental to disease </v>
<v Speaker 1>mitigation across the board.</v>

934
00:51:55.550 --> 00:51:57.470
<v Speaker 1>So tHis is some of the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

935
00:51:57.570 --> 00:52:02.570
<v Speaker 1>there are so many different examples </v>
<v Speaker 1>like this where mushrooms need to be </v>

936
00:52:02.570 --> 00:52:06.311
<v Speaker 1>advanced to the front stage of </v>
<v Speaker 1>consideration by serious scientists and </v>

937
00:52:06.411 --> 00:52:10.010
<v Speaker 1>give up your michael phobia or even your</v>
<v Speaker 1>silo phobia,</v>

938
00:52:10.310 --> 00:52:15.310
<v Speaker 1>the irrational fear of psilocybin </v>
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms and look upon these with new </v>

939
00:52:15.310 --> 00:52:19.601
<v Speaker 1>eyes and drop your prejudices and just </v>
<v Speaker 1>look at as a serious scientific </v>

940
00:52:21.080 --> 00:52:23.750
<v Speaker 1>analysis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

941
00:52:25.220 --> 00:52:30.220
<v Speaker 1>how is this received?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like in the general scientific </v>

942
00:52:30.220 --> 00:52:30.220
<v Speaker 1>community?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there skepticism?</v>

943
00:52:31.150 --> 00:52:35.180
<v Speaker 1>I love my skeptics because unless </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're prejudice against you,</v>

944
00:52:35.640 --> 00:52:37.250
<v Speaker 1>some people are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can never convince them,</v>

945
00:52:37.251 --> 00:52:40.700
<v Speaker 1>but if scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they see the data sets and they see</v>

946
00:52:40.701 --> 00:52:45.701
<v Speaker 1>there's a dozen or more publications </v>
<v Speaker 1>with scientists without commercial </v>

947
00:52:45.701 --> 00:52:47.090
<v Speaker 1>interests who've done this </v>
<v Speaker 1>independently,</v>

948
00:52:47.091 --> 00:52:52.091
<v Speaker 1>then it's being taken very seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So though the whole medical community </v>

949
00:52:52.091 --> 00:52:53.290
<v Speaker 1>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

950
00:52:53.470 --> 00:52:56.600
<v Speaker 1>I speak at a number of medical </v>
<v Speaker 1>conferences at ted med,</v>

951
00:52:56.601 --> 00:53:00.020
<v Speaker 1>the american academy of dermatology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the keynote speakers.</v>

952
00:53:00.290 --> 00:53:02.830
<v Speaker 1>Many medical conferences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

953
00:53:03.140 --> 00:53:08.140
<v Speaker 1>and it's great because I can take people</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are totally skeptical and most of </v>

954
00:53:09.921 --> 00:53:14.921
<v Speaker 1>them walk out of that room convinced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and why shouldn't we think that fungi </v>

955
00:53:15.291 --> 00:53:16.610
<v Speaker 1>are sources of medicines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

956
00:53:16.611 --> 00:53:20.450
<v Speaker 1>penicillin may have tipped World war ii </v>
<v Speaker 1>in our favor.</v>

957
00:53:21.230 --> 00:53:26.230
<v Speaker 1>So the job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the japanese and germans did not have </v>

958
00:53:26.230 --> 00:53:27.060
<v Speaker 1>panelists penicillin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though Alexander Fleming discovered</v>

959
00:53:27.061 --> 00:53:32.061
<v Speaker 1>it in 1928 in 1941,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lab tech researcher went to a market </v>

960
00:53:35.671 --> 00:53:37.620
<v Speaker 1>in chicago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>found a moldy cantaloupe,</v>

961
00:53:38.130 --> 00:53:41.700
<v Speaker 1>and alexander fleming's strain of </v>
<v Speaker 1>penicillin was too weak.</v>

962
00:53:41.701 --> 00:53:46.701
<v Speaker 1>It couldn't be commercialized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This lady researcher who found this </v>

963
00:53:46.701 --> 00:53:50.130
<v Speaker 1>moldy cantaloupe found a penicillium </v>
<v Speaker 1>strain that was 200 times more potent.</v>

964
00:53:51.090 --> 00:53:54.750
<v Speaker 1>And as a result of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in war,</v>

965
00:53:55.230 --> 00:54:00.180
<v Speaker 1>the most of the casualties died from </v>
<v Speaker 1>infections.</v>

966
00:54:00.630 --> 00:54:05.630
<v Speaker 1>And so the british and the english,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the english and the americans had </v>

967
00:54:06.691 --> 00:54:09.210
<v Speaker 1>penicillin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The germans and japanese did not.</v>

968
00:54:09.990 --> 00:54:13.860
<v Speaker 1>And so it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a great npr analysis on this,</v>

969
00:54:13.861 --> 00:54:18.861
<v Speaker 1>on the history of penicillin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it is one of the major factors in </v>

970
00:54:18.960 --> 00:54:23.960
<v Speaker 1>helping tilt the balance in the favor of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the allied powers against the axis </v>

971
00:54:23.960 --> 00:54:25.830
<v Speaker 1>powers so concerned with the researchers</v>
<v Speaker 1>in england.</v>

972
00:54:25.831 --> 00:54:29.370
<v Speaker 1>They impregnated their clothes with </v>
<v Speaker 1>spores of this mold strain.</v>

973
00:54:29.610 --> 00:54:33.120
<v Speaker 1>So if our laboratories were bombed or </v>
<v Speaker 1>they were captured,</v>

974
00:54:33.330 --> 00:54:38.330
<v Speaker 1>if one of them escaped,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they could regenerate the culture from </v>

975
00:54:38.330 --> 00:54:38.330
<v Speaker 1>their clothing.</v>

976
00:54:38.330 --> 00:54:38.330
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

977
00:54:40.450 --> 00:54:42.910
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this speaks to the panspermia.</v>

978
00:54:43.540 --> 00:54:48.540
<v Speaker 1>We're all carrying microbiomes of fungi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact that you and I are here </v>

979
00:54:48.540 --> 00:54:52.891
<v Speaker 1>together means that I have now </v>
<v Speaker 1>inoculated you with my microbiome of </v>

980
00:54:53.591 --> 00:54:55.240
<v Speaker 1>selected fungi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So joe,</v>

981
00:54:55.410 --> 00:54:56.440
<v Speaker 1>you are now a vector.</v>

982
00:54:56.690 --> 00:54:58.490
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>awesome.</v>

983
00:54:58.550 --> 00:55:02.800
<v Speaker 2>Congratulations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now does the frustrating aspects of.</v>

984
00:55:04.320 --> 00:55:06.530
<v Speaker 2>What is the word that you use?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fungi phobiA.</v>

985
00:55:06.531 --> 00:55:08.720
<v Speaker 2>So we used by co phobia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>michael phobia.</v>

986
00:55:09.200 --> 00:55:11.510
<v Speaker 2>The frustrating aspects are first of </v>
<v Speaker 2>all,</v>

987
00:55:11.511 --> 00:55:12.530
<v Speaker 2>prohibition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

988
00:55:12.560 --> 00:55:17.560
<v Speaker 2>Sweeping psychedelic act of 1970 that </v>
<v Speaker 2>made psilocybin mushrooms illegal.</v>

989
00:55:18.350 --> 00:55:21.620
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then on top of it,</v>

990
00:55:21.980 --> 00:55:26.980
<v Speaker 2>the commercial pharmaceutical industry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which doesn't want to have anything to </v>

991
00:55:28.191 --> 00:55:33.191
<v Speaker 2>do with anything that it can't patent </v>
<v Speaker 2>and has so many doctors and so many </v>

992
00:55:33.191 --> 00:55:36.170
<v Speaker 2>researchers in its pocket.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you have two issues there,</v>

993
00:55:36.171 --> 00:55:37.970
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have one issue that people,</v>

994
00:55:38.120 --> 00:55:40.550
<v Speaker 2>which is obviously why you don't like </v>
<v Speaker 2>the word shroom.</v>

995
00:55:40.910 --> 00:55:44.570
<v Speaker 2>People think of mushrooms as a party </v>
<v Speaker 2>drug of like being silly,</v>

996
00:55:45.380 --> 00:55:47.300
<v Speaker 2>freaking out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing something stupid,</v>

997
00:55:47.330 --> 00:55:50.510
<v Speaker 2>regrettable actions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then afterwards going,</v>

998
00:55:50.530 --> 00:55:52.070
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we got so crazy.</v>

999
00:55:52.260 --> 00:55:57.260
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking of it as a frivolous sort</v>
<v Speaker 2>of thing that you would engage in.</v>

1000
00:55:58.340 --> 00:56:03.340
<v Speaker 2>Whereas what you're trying to do is show</v>
<v Speaker 2>the absolute hard science.</v>

1001
00:56:03.680 --> 00:56:07.580
<v Speaker 2>Do you feel that this absolute hard </v>
<v Speaker 2>science is.</v>

1002
00:56:09.060 --> 00:56:14.060
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you must feel that it's unfairly </v>

1003
00:56:14.060 --> 00:56:14.060
<v Speaker 2>inhibited and hindered.</v>

1004
00:56:14.390 --> 00:56:16.880
<v Speaker 1>The sun has been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's never been a title change.</v>

1005
00:56:16.960 --> 00:56:18.550
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>

1006
00:56:19.570 --> 00:56:24.570
<v Speaker 1>pharma ecology of the use psilocybin and</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1007
00:56:25.180 --> 00:56:28.870
<v Speaker 1>and its utility as a therapeutic agent </v>
<v Speaker 1>is there's a title change.</v>

1008
00:56:29.140 --> 00:56:34.140
<v Speaker 1>I think now there's over 700 patients </v>
<v Speaker 1>have gone through johns hopkins clinical</v>

1009
00:56:36.671 --> 00:56:40.810
<v Speaker 1>trials for things like end of life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>add depression,</v>

1010
00:56:41.140 --> 00:56:46.140
<v Speaker 1>ptsd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's studies out on treating </v>

1011
00:56:46.140 --> 00:56:47.140
<v Speaker 1>alcoholics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And drug addicts,</v>

1012
00:56:48.700 --> 00:56:52.360
<v Speaker 1>so and this is important to communicate </v>
<v Speaker 1>to people.</v>

1013
00:56:52.440 --> 00:56:55.100
<v Speaker 1>In John Hopkins study in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dr roland griffiths,</v>

1014
00:56:55.110 --> 00:56:56.650
<v Speaker 1>a great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great scientist.</v>

1015
00:56:56.710 --> 00:56:59.170
<v Speaker 1>He's been running and championing these </v>
<v Speaker 1>studies,</v>

1016
00:56:59.890 --> 00:57:04.890
<v Speaker 1>came up with a very interesting series </v>
<v Speaker 1>of analyses and some of the take home </v>

1017
00:57:04.890 --> 00:57:08.371
<v Speaker 1>points were only 70 percent of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people described the psilocybin </v>

1018
00:57:08.441 --> 00:57:13.000
<v Speaker 1>experience therapeutically under </v>
<v Speaker 1>controlled settings at John Hopkins with</v>

1019
00:57:13.001 --> 00:57:15.160
<v Speaker 1>a very high dose of psilocybin as being </v>
<v Speaker 1>beneficial.</v>

1020
00:57:15.370 --> 00:57:16.720
<v Speaker 1>Only 70 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>70 percent.</v>

1021
00:57:16.721 --> 00:57:19.450
<v Speaker 1>Thirty percent of them saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't like that,</v>

1022
00:57:19.870 --> 00:57:23.590
<v Speaker 1>but in a retrospective study,</v>
<v Speaker 1>14 months to two years later,</v>

1023
00:57:24.730 --> 00:57:28.240
<v Speaker 1>the 70 percent of the people who said it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a beneficial experience,</v>

1024
00:57:28.270 --> 00:57:33.270
<v Speaker 1>still described it as one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>significant beneficial experiences of </v>

1025
00:57:33.270 --> 00:57:34.990
<v Speaker 1>their lifetime and interviewing their </v>
<v Speaker 1>friends,</v>

1026
00:57:34.991 --> 00:57:35.980
<v Speaker 1>their spouses.</v>

1027
00:57:36.520 --> 00:57:41.520
<v Speaker 1>They saw a permanent residual effect </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the benefits of the experience.</v>

1028
00:57:42.851 --> 00:57:45.820
<v Speaker 1>There were nicer people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're nicer to get along.</v>

1029
00:57:45.821 --> 00:57:50.821
<v Speaker 1>They're less prone to anger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had many of values that we would </v>

1030
00:57:51.700 --> 00:57:54.400
<v Speaker 1>cherish as an improved community of </v>
<v Speaker 1>individuals.</v>

1031
00:57:54.880 --> 00:57:57.460
<v Speaker 1>The 30 percent of the people who had a </v>
<v Speaker 1>negative experience,</v>

1032
00:57:57.461 --> 00:58:00.790
<v Speaker 1>the negativity of the experience did not</v>
<v Speaker 1>extend Beyond the experience themselves,</v>

1033
00:58:01.360 --> 00:58:04.570
<v Speaker 1>so they didn't have collateral damage </v>
<v Speaker 1>where we had collateral benefit,</v>

1034
00:58:04.990 --> 00:58:09.990
<v Speaker 1>so the positive people saw that as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>positive experience and the memory of </v>

1035
00:58:09.990 --> 00:58:10.810
<v Speaker 1>the experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is so cool.</v>

1036
00:58:11.320 --> 00:58:16.150
<v Speaker 1>The memory of the experience kept them </v>
<v Speaker 1>optimistic,</v>

1037
00:58:16.420 --> 00:58:21.420
<v Speaker 1>hopeful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they felt benefits from just </v>

1038
00:58:21.420 --> 00:58:22.540
<v Speaker 1>remembering the experience that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>had a negative experience.</v>

1039
00:58:22.541 --> 00:58:26.800
<v Speaker 1>They just wouldn't do that again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So these mushrooms are obviously not for</v>

1040
00:58:26.801 --> 00:58:29.260
<v Speaker 1>everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for the people who do benefit,</v>

1041
00:58:29.261 --> 00:58:31.240
<v Speaker 1>they benefit substantially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't you feel</v>

1042
00:58:31.430 --> 00:58:33.680
<v Speaker 2>a lot of the people that have those </v>
<v Speaker 2>negative experiences,</v>

1043
00:58:33.681 --> 00:58:38.681
<v Speaker 2>at least from my understanding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of it are people that have some </v>

1044
00:58:38.681 --> 00:58:42.911
<v Speaker 2>serious issues that they're not dealing </v>
<v Speaker 2>with and ego problems and the mushrooms </v>

1045
00:58:42.911 --> 00:58:45.860
<v Speaker 2>expose that and they tried to wrestle </v>
<v Speaker 2>the mushroom.</v>

1046
00:58:46.280 --> 00:58:47.100
<v Speaker 2>I mean when.</v>

1047
00:58:47.260 --> 00:58:49.270
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the very well put.</v>

1048
00:58:49.510 --> 00:58:54.510
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a big issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people are afraid of their inner </v>

1049
00:58:54.510 --> 00:58:54.970
<v Speaker 1>self.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They know we're all.</v>

1050
00:58:55.060 --> 00:58:57.610
<v Speaker 1>He can't paint the canvas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>black and white.</v>

1051
00:58:58.240 --> 00:59:03.240
<v Speaker 1>We're a big spectrum of complex </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality traits and what happens to </v>

1052
00:59:04.091 --> 00:59:06.310
<v Speaker 1>somebody when they're two years old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five years old,</v>

1053
00:59:06.340 --> 00:59:08.530
<v Speaker 1>what trauma they experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1054
00:59:08.550 --> 00:59:11.470
<v Speaker 1>it's very complex to be able to make the</v>
<v Speaker 1>savings,</v>

1055
00:59:11.471 --> 00:59:13.510
<v Speaker 1>but I think as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a group,</v>

1056
00:59:13.511 --> 00:59:18.511
<v Speaker 1>there are some people who are on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>edge and they may not control their </v>

1057
00:59:20.201 --> 00:59:24.530
<v Speaker 1>innermost emotions and they're afraid of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that in normal state of consciousness.</v>

1058
00:59:24.531 --> 00:59:26.570
<v Speaker 1>So they're Afraid they might lose their </v>
<v Speaker 1>control.</v>

1059
00:59:26.620 --> 00:59:27.880
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1060
00:59:27.881 --> 00:59:32.881
<v Speaker 2>I mean I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had personally some terrIfying </v>

1061
00:59:32.881 --> 00:59:35.401
<v Speaker 2>psychedelic experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the way I've gotten through them is </v>

1062
00:59:35.401 --> 00:59:37.891
<v Speaker 2>just to give in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just to give in and for a person like </v>

1063
00:59:37.891 --> 00:59:38.830
<v Speaker 2>myself was kind of a control freak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially when I was younger.</v>

1064
00:59:38.831 --> 00:59:42.120
<v Speaker 2>It's a hard thing to do to use because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

1065
00:59:42.130 --> 00:59:42.300
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1066
00:59:42.310 --> 00:59:43.150
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be fine.</v>

1067
00:59:43.151 --> 00:59:43.310
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1068
00:59:43.311 --> 00:59:43.510
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1069
00:59:43.511 --> 00:59:44.430
<v Speaker 2>Fuck this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1070
00:59:44.500 --> 00:59:46.330
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to know that I don't like </v>
<v Speaker 2>where this is going.</v>

1071
00:59:46.331 --> 00:59:48.350
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to stop this right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to put a halt to this.</v>

1072
00:59:48.360 --> 00:59:51.640
<v Speaker 2>I bring myself back to sobriety like </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's impossible.</v>

1073
00:59:51.641 --> 00:59:56.641
<v Speaker 2>It's not going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you have to figure out how to just </v>

1074
00:59:56.641 --> 01:00:00.061
<v Speaker 2>let go and how to just really let go and</v>
<v Speaker 2>trust the mushroom or the dmt or </v>

1075
01:00:00.371 --> 01:00:04.180
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is that you're on to take </v>
<v Speaker 2>you on this ride and you'll be okay when</v>

1076
01:00:04.181 --> 01:00:06.820
<v Speaker 2>it's over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you can't do that,</v>

1077
01:00:06.970 --> 01:00:11.970
<v Speaker 2>that's the bad trIp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I've seen a lot of people have bad </v>

1078
01:00:11.970 --> 01:00:11.970
<v Speaker 2>trips.</v>

1079
01:00:11.970 --> 01:00:11.970
<v Speaker 1>We'll say close friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We.</v>

1080
01:00:11.970 --> 01:00:16.540
<v Speaker 1>We are the casualty of the fact that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have an infrastructure tradition </v>

1081
01:00:16.540 --> 01:00:18.060
<v Speaker 1>in our societies like first peoples and </v>
<v Speaker 1>native americans too.</v>

1082
01:00:18.570 --> 01:00:23.570
<v Speaker 1>They have set up a structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have a tradition shamanically your </v>

1083
01:00:23.570 --> 01:00:23.570
<v Speaker 1>mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>traditions,</v>

1084
01:00:23.570 --> 01:00:24.510
<v Speaker 1>rituals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>elders.</v>

1085
01:00:24.610 --> 01:00:27.390
<v Speaker 1>They have done this for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have set and setting down.</v>

1086
01:00:27.900 --> 01:00:32.900
<v Speaker 1>They know how to treat these powerful </v>
<v Speaker 1>medicines in the right context and we </v>

1087
01:00:33.661 --> 01:00:35.730
<v Speaker 1>lack that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You did,</v>

1088
01:00:35.731 --> 01:00:40.731
<v Speaker 1>you know that mushrooms were </v>
<v Speaker 1>specifically banned from beer in the </v>

1089
01:00:40.731 --> 01:00:42.330
<v Speaker 1>bavarian beer act of 15,</v>
<v Speaker 1>16,</v>

1090
01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:47.880
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And mushrooms and hen bane and other </v>

1091
01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:50.720
<v Speaker 1>plants were used in meads psychoactive </v>
<v Speaker 1>beers and celebrated by people </v>

1092
01:00:53.971 --> 01:00:57.390
<v Speaker 1>practicing pagan religions in europe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the forest.</v>

1093
01:00:58.140 --> 01:01:01.410
<v Speaker 1>And the struggle between,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe christianity,</v>

1094
01:01:01.411 --> 01:01:04.320
<v Speaker 1>monotheism versus polytheism and nature </v>
<v Speaker 1>based religions.</v>

1095
01:01:04.620 --> 01:01:08.550
<v Speaker 1>There was a collision course and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>under pressure of the church,</v>

1096
01:01:08.580 --> 01:01:13.580
<v Speaker 1>they banned the addition of these plants</v>
<v Speaker 1>that could be your gateway to god </v>

1097
01:01:13.580 --> 01:01:16.710
<v Speaker 1>because the church wanted to be in </v>
<v Speaker 1>between you and god.</v>

1098
01:01:17.010 --> 01:01:22.010
<v Speaker 1>They wanted to get the tIthings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They wanted to be your portal and </v>

1099
01:01:22.010 --> 01:01:22.170
<v Speaker 1>control,</v>
<v Speaker 1>access to the divine,</v>

1100
01:01:22.770 --> 01:01:27.770
<v Speaker 1>and so these mushrooms are looked upon </v>
<v Speaker 1>as being specifically a threat to </v>

1101
01:01:29.220 --> 01:01:34.220
<v Speaker 1>monotheism and christianity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the the very end beer act banned </v>

1102
01:01:34.220 --> 01:01:34.220
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms.</v>

1103
01:01:34.220 --> 01:01:38.870
<v Speaker 2>That's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Terence had some pretty interesting </v>

1104
01:01:38.870 --> 01:01:41.841
<v Speaker 2>ideas about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Terence mckenna did one of the things </v>

1105
01:01:41.841 --> 01:01:44.661
<v Speaker 2>that he said that he believed that as </v>
<v Speaker 2>the climate changed and some mushrooms </v>

1106
01:01:44.661 --> 01:01:47.661
<v Speaker 2>became less and less available,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they started preserving them in honey </v>

1107
01:01:47.661 --> 01:01:50.160
<v Speaker 2>because you can preserve things in honey</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that in preserving things in honey,</v>

1108
01:01:50.370 --> 01:01:55.110
<v Speaker 2>you also run into the possibility of </v>
<v Speaker 2>fermented honey and then fermented honey</v>

1109
01:01:55.111 --> 01:02:00.111
<v Speaker 2>becoming mead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You go into more of an alcohol culture </v>

1110
01:02:00.111 --> 01:02:02.970
<v Speaker 2>than a psychedelic culture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is really like on the opposite end</v>

1111
01:02:02.971 --> 01:02:06.720
<v Speaker 2>of the spectrum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alcohol culture is loosened inhibitions,</v>

1112
01:02:06.721 --> 01:02:09.930
<v Speaker 2>wild behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 2>less thought of the consequences of your</v>

1113
01:02:09.931 --> 01:02:12.300
<v Speaker 2>actions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>less introspective,</v>

1114
01:02:12.301 --> 01:02:14.930
<v Speaker 2>thinking much more chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

1115
01:02:15.180 --> 01:02:20.180
<v Speaker 2>and that he believes that this has </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably resulted in some sort of a </v>

1116
01:02:20.180 --> 01:02:21.360
<v Speaker 2>shift he believed rather before he </v>
<v Speaker 2>passed,</v>

1117
01:02:21.361 --> 01:02:26.361
<v Speaker 2>that was resulted in some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>shift from these more communal mushroom </v>

1118
01:02:28.501 --> 01:02:33.501
<v Speaker 2>worshiping cultures to what you saw like</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the inquisition and some of the more </v>

1119
01:02:34.441 --> 01:02:35.910
<v Speaker 2>chaotic times in history.</v>

1120
01:02:36.190 --> 01:02:39.460
<v Speaker 1>I would respectfully disagree with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>secoNd part of that analysis,</v>

1121
01:02:39.870 --> 01:02:42.520
<v Speaker 1>not what you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what terence would have been saying.</v>

1122
01:02:43.090 --> 01:02:45.850
<v Speaker 1>Mushroom being preserved in honey as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>way of preventing them from rotting.</v>

1123
01:02:47.250 --> 01:02:48.560
<v Speaker 1>Do with mead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well you did.</v>

1124
01:02:48.670 --> 01:02:50.230
<v Speaker 1>I think it did have something to do with</v>
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

1125
01:02:50.290 --> 01:02:53.920
<v Speaker 1>but the amount of alcohol being produced</v>
<v Speaker 1>versus the dose that you would get.</v>

1126
01:02:54.330 --> 01:02:59.330
<v Speaker 1>It seemed to me this all simon dose Will</v>
<v Speaker 1>be so much more powerful than the small </v>

1127
01:02:59.330 --> 01:03:00.630
<v Speaker 1>amount of alcohol you'd be trying.</v>

1128
01:03:01.350 --> 01:03:03.010
<v Speaker 2>Am I misrepresenting what he was saYing?</v>

1129
01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:03.910
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

1130
01:03:03.970 --> 01:03:05.080
<v Speaker 1>I think you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

1131
01:03:05.350 --> 01:03:10.350
<v Speaker 1>you have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just disagree with his initial idea </v>

1132
01:03:10.350 --> 01:03:10.350
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's okay.</v>

1133
01:03:10.350 --> 01:03:11.080
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>terence isn't terence is,</v>

1134
01:03:11.081 --> 01:03:16.081
<v Speaker 1>it was a very smart guy and I still </v>
<v Speaker 1>appreciate and love him wandering </v>

1135
01:03:16.081 --> 01:03:20.281
<v Speaker 1>thoughts and they were amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but his time timewave zero was totally </v>

1136
01:03:20.281 --> 01:03:20.281
<v Speaker 1>bs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that was crazy.</v>

1137
01:03:20.281 --> 01:03:24.840
<v Speaker 1>That was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had the end of time occurring on his </v>

1138
01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:24.840
<v Speaker 1>birthday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

1139
01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:24.840
<v Speaker 1>don't you think that's a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>egocentric?</v>

1140
01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:26.650
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1141
01:03:26.700 --> 01:03:31.700
<v Speaker 2>he also had some strange sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>computer program and I've tried to </v>

1142
01:03:31.700 --> 01:03:31.700
<v Speaker 2>follow it many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many times.</v>

1143
01:03:31.700 --> 01:03:36.081
<v Speaker 2>Some of the lectures that he gave on </v>
<v Speaker 2>that computer program that represented </v>

1144
01:03:36.081 --> 01:03:38.580
<v Speaker 2>timewave zero,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea was for people interested,</v>

1145
01:03:38.581 --> 01:03:43.581
<v Speaker 2>he just thought there was going to come </v>
<v Speaker 2>a point of ultimate novelty and somehow </v>

1146
01:03:43.581 --> 01:03:48.201
<v Speaker 2>or another conveniently he had that </v>
<v Speaker 2>point coinciding with both his birthday </v>

1147
01:03:48.201 --> 01:03:48.990
<v Speaker 2>and the end of the mayan calendar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1148
01:03:48.991 --> 01:03:49.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1149
01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:52.260
<v Speaker 2>His birthday was december 20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first 2012 as well.</v>

1150
01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:55.060
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1151
01:03:55.260 --> 01:03:58.430
<v Speaker 1>But the other thing to celebrate totally</v>
<v Speaker 1>egotistical,</v>

1152
01:03:58.540 --> 01:03:59.920
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I loved him,</v>

1153
01:03:59.930 --> 01:04:04.250
<v Speaker 1>but he basically got the math to conform</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the convenience of his birthday.</v>

1154
01:04:05.060 --> 01:04:05.830
<v Speaker 1>So it's like</v>

1155
01:04:06.670 --> 01:04:08.470
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're all guilty of being human.</v>

1156
01:04:08.540 --> 01:04:08.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1157
01:04:08.830 --> 01:04:10.180
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean even the great ones.</v>

1158
01:04:10.181 --> 01:04:10.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1159
01:04:10.731 --> 01:04:15.731
<v Speaker 2>and he was a great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was one of my favorite people in </v>

1160
01:04:15.731 --> 01:04:15.731
<v Speaker 2>terms of like listening to his </v>
<v Speaker 2>recordings.</v>

1161
01:04:15.731 --> 01:04:17.080
<v Speaker 2>Do you ever listen to psychedelic salon?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1162
01:04:17.260 --> 01:04:17.800
<v Speaker 2>Amazing.</v>

1163
01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:21.020
<v Speaker 1>One of the best articulators of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>english language I've ever.</v>

1164
01:04:21.350 --> 01:04:22.330
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

1165
01:04:22.331 --> 01:04:23.890
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as is his brother.</v>

1166
01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:24.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every time is how,</v>

1167
01:04:25.010 --> 01:04:27.100
<v Speaker 2>which what brings me back to the stoned </v>
<v Speaker 2>ape theory.</v>

1168
01:04:27.101 --> 01:04:28.630
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that his brother </v>
<v Speaker 2>talked about,</v>

1169
01:04:28.631 --> 01:04:33.631
<v Speaker 2>and maybe you could elaborate on this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was the impact that psilocybin has on </v>

1170
01:04:33.631 --> 01:04:38.550
<v Speaker 2>the creation of language and he thinks </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the very pathways that you were </v>

1171
01:04:38.550 --> 01:04:42.631
<v Speaker 2>discussing that psilocybin sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>empowers that,</v>

1172
01:04:42.641 --> 01:04:47.641
<v Speaker 2>that may very well have been how human </v>
<v Speaker 2>beings started elaborating on language.</v>

1173
01:04:47.960 --> 01:04:52.960
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's correct on that because a </v>

1174
01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:52.960
<v Speaker 1>glossary leo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1175
01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:54.800
<v Speaker 1>and we know the neurogenesis occurs in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the hippocampus.</v>

1176
01:04:55.010 --> 01:05:00.010
<v Speaker 1>Gloss eylea is the ability to speak and </v>
<v Speaker 1>elocute languages and new words as </v>

1177
01:05:01.450 --> 01:05:06.450
<v Speaker 1>languaging.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your ability to language is increased </v>

1178
01:05:06.450 --> 01:05:10.390
<v Speaker 1>under the experience of psilocybin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Speaking to neurogenesis and exactly </v>

1179
01:05:10.390 --> 01:05:13.871
<v Speaker 1>what we've been talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that basically your hippocampus is </v>

1180
01:05:13.871 --> 01:05:18.071
<v Speaker 1>your center for learning and memory and </v>
<v Speaker 1>is why the mice got better because </v>

1181
01:05:19.481 --> 01:05:24.481
<v Speaker 1>neurogenesis was occurring in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hippocampus and so they regained their </v>

1182
01:05:24.481 --> 01:05:27.430
<v Speaker 1>memory and they were able to learn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so yes,</v>

1183
01:05:27.431 --> 01:05:31.840
<v Speaker 1>I think this neurogenesis not only </v>
<v Speaker 1>occurs in the hippocampus,</v>

1184
01:05:31.841 --> 01:05:36.841
<v Speaker 1>but I think it can also occur in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>peripheral nervous system of an </v>

1185
01:05:36.841 --> 01:05:40.981
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily powerful story that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>would like to tell about neurogenesis </v>

1186
01:05:40.981 --> 01:05:45.511
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was from a good friend of mine named </v>

1187
01:05:45.511 --> 01:05:46.540
<v Speaker 1>bill webb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He lived in big sur California.</v>

1188
01:05:46.840 --> 01:05:51.840
<v Speaker 1>He was a friend of ansell adams and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Henry Miller who wroTe copic tropic of </v>

1189
01:05:51.850 --> 01:05:54.400
<v Speaker 1>capricorn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it was in the sixties.</v>

1190
01:05:54.401 --> 01:05:59.401
<v Speaker 1>This is a big part of the movement in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the sixties and seventies and antal </v>

1191
01:05:59.401 --> 01:06:03.331
<v Speaker 1>items is the very famous photographer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And bill webb was a mentor to me.</v>

1192
01:06:04.211 --> 01:06:07.240
<v Speaker 1>I met him in 20 years of age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was writing.</v>

1193
01:06:07.330 --> 01:06:08.800
<v Speaker 1>I wrote my first book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophy,</v>

1194
01:06:09.070 --> 01:06:10.870
<v Speaker 1>mushroom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophy,</v>

1195
01:06:10.871 --> 01:06:11.950
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and our allies.</v>

1196
01:06:12.040 --> 01:06:14.830
<v Speaker 1>You wrote your first book at 20 axiom?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was 18.</v>

1197
01:06:14.860 --> 01:06:15.870
<v Speaker 1>You bad motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1198
01:06:17.050 --> 01:06:18.160
<v Speaker 1>It was the weirdest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1199
01:06:18.190 --> 01:06:23.190
<v Speaker 1>I haven't told anyone this in 30 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I went up to a place called Montana </v>

1200
01:06:25.421 --> 01:06:30.421
<v Speaker 1>books in seattle and I had my manuscript</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I walked into the bookstore because </v>

1201
01:06:30.421 --> 01:06:34.771
<v Speaker 1>I was told Montana books was a kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>an avant garde book publisher in the </v>

1202
01:06:34.771 --> 01:06:39.480
<v Speaker 1>early 19 seventies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I was told to go up there and I </v>

1203
01:06:39.480 --> 01:06:42.901
<v Speaker 1>made an appointment and then I go in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm meeting with a publisher and he </v>

1204
01:06:42.901 --> 01:06:42.901
<v Speaker 1>goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

1205
01:06:42.901 --> 01:06:43.180
<v Speaker 1>this is an interesting little field </v>
<v Speaker 1>guide you wrote,</v>

1206
01:06:43.181 --> 01:06:44.740
<v Speaker 1>but this is not our market.</v>

1207
01:06:45.050 --> 01:06:48.790
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you really need a book representative.</v>

1208
01:06:48.791 --> 01:06:50.740
<v Speaker 1>You need an agent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

1209
01:06:50.741 --> 01:06:53.500
<v Speaker 1>the best agent I know by far is bill </v>
<v Speaker 1>webb,</v>

1210
01:06:54.060 --> 01:06:59.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I haven't seen bill webb in two </v>

1211
01:06:59.060 --> 01:06:59.060
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1212
01:06:59.060 --> 01:07:00.940
<v Speaker 1>you really need to see bill webb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when he said those words,</v>

1213
01:07:01.330 --> 01:07:03.550
<v Speaker 1>the door opened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little bell rang.</v>

1214
01:07:03.910 --> 01:07:06.990
<v Speaker 1>And in walked bill webb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was like,</v>

1215
01:07:07.210 --> 01:07:09.820
<v Speaker 1>the publisher goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is freaking crazy,</v>

1216
01:07:09.850 --> 01:07:11.230
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So building a webinar,</v>

1217
01:07:11.231 --> 01:07:13.960
<v Speaker 1>I became tightly bonded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a father figure to me.</v>

1218
01:07:14.200 --> 01:07:19.200
<v Speaker 1>He was in his seventies when I met him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So bill and I went down to big sur and </v>

1219
01:07:19.200 --> 01:07:22.660
<v Speaker 1>we tripped together,</v>

<v Speaker 1>very tight and then bill was about 82 </v>

1221

<v Speaker 1>years of age and he calls me up and he </v>

1240
01:08:07.901 --> 01:08:12.901
<v Speaker 1>hate it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't hear the birds or the waves </v>

1241
01:08:12.901 --> 01:08:16.470
<v Speaker 1>breaking on the beach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a big part of the big sur </v>

1242
01:08:16.470 --> 01:08:16.470
<v Speaker 1>experience live above the cliffs of big </v>

<v Speaker 1>I did a five gram dose of cubensis.</v>

1247
01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:25.400
<v Speaker 1>That's the hero's journey for people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>are listening.</v>

1248
01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:27.890
<v Speaker 1>Five grams is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is is it,</v>

1249
01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:29.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're on the floor,</v>

1250
01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:33.910
<v Speaker 1>and was on his deck and it was house in </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he noticed that he dIdn't.</v>

1251
01:08:33.920 --> 01:08:37.070
<v Speaker 1>his hearing aid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he could hear the birds in the waves and</v>

1252
01:08:37.071 --> 01:08:39.320
<v Speaker 1>things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's laying there just.</v>

1254
01:08:42.010 --> 01:08:47.010
<v Speaker 1>mid eighties at that point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's just like having this </v>

1255
01:08:47.010 --> 01:08:49.660
<v Speaker 1>incredibly blissful experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's coming there to reconcile his own </v>

1256
01:08:49.660 --> 01:08:50.600
<v Speaker 1>mortality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact that he's going to die,</v>

1257
01:08:51.050 --> 01:08:55.490
<v Speaker 1>he's thinking about his life and he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of dreaming in that dreamscape.</v>

1258
01:08:56.030 --> 01:08:57.680
<v Speaker 1>And he hears,</v>
<v Speaker 1>click,</v>

1259
01:08:57.740 --> 01:08:58.970
<v Speaker 1>click,</v>
<v Speaker 1>click,</v>

1260
01:08:58.971 --> 01:08:59.390
<v Speaker 1>click,</v>
<v Speaker 1>click,</v>

1261
01:08:59.391 --> 01:09:00.140
<v Speaker 1>click,</v>
<v Speaker 1>click.</v>

1262
01:09:01.160 --> 01:09:04.040
<v Speaker 1>He looks around and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's that noise?</v>

1263
01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:07.890
<v Speaker 1>He shakes his ear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe something is click,</v>

1264
01:09:08.050 --> 01:09:08.530
<v Speaker 1>click,</v>
<v Speaker 1>click,</v>

1265
01:09:08.531 --> 01:09:08.890
<v Speaker 1>click,</v>
<v Speaker 1>click,</v>

1266
01:09:08.891 --> 01:09:09.440
<v Speaker 1>click,</v>
<v Speaker 1>click.</v>

1267
01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.710
<v Speaker 1>He looks around and he decided,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's driving me crazy.</v>

1268
01:09:12.711 --> 01:09:14.330
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where's the sound coming from?</v>

1269
01:09:14.710 --> 01:09:19.710
<v Speaker 1>And he finally looked over and it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>ants walking on the deck by near his </v>

1270
01:09:19.710 --> 01:09:21.500
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He could hear their footsteps.</v>

1271
01:09:24.230 --> 01:09:26.510
<v Speaker 1>Neurogenesis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus christ,</v>

1272
01:09:26.890 --> 01:09:31.890
<v Speaker 1>and this is an easily measurable metric,</v>
<v Speaker 1>silicide and experienced while he was </v>

1273
01:09:32.151 --> 01:09:35.180
<v Speaker 1>fully on the experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said he did not use a hearing aid for</v>

1274
01:09:35.181 --> 01:09:37.340
<v Speaker 1>three or four days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I've mentioned this today,</v>

1275
01:09:37.430 --> 01:09:38.990
<v Speaker 1>just do mushrooms again and keep the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hearing.</v>

1276
01:09:39.200 --> 01:09:44.200
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's basically he ran out of cubensis </v>

1277
01:09:44.200 --> 01:09:44.200
<v Speaker 1>and so hearing he was asking me for </v>
<v Speaker 1>cubensis and that's.</v>

1278
01:09:44.200 --> 01:09:48.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry I can't get provided.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I've mentioned this now to several of</v>

1279
01:09:48.201 --> 01:09:51.650
<v Speaker 1>the clinical researchers who have dea </v>
<v Speaker 1>licensed or doing clinical research.</v>

1280
01:09:51.651 --> 01:09:56.651
<v Speaker 1>This is an easily measurable metric you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can do as people were fully,</v>

1281
01:09:57.380 --> 01:10:02.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in these sessions they could be giving </v>

1282
01:10:02.380 --> 01:10:05.351
<v Speaker 1>them auditory stimulation to see if the </v>
<v Speaker 1>auditory nerve is undergoing regena </v>

1283
01:10:07.670 --> 01:10:11.390
<v Speaker 1>neurogenesis and so this is something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I think that can be incorporated in</v>

1284
01:10:11.391 --> 01:10:13.010
<v Speaker 1>the clinical studies to see if this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>true.</v>

1285
01:10:13.011 --> 01:10:16.280
<v Speaker 1>But bill was emphatic and when bill webb</v>
<v Speaker 1>spoke,</v>

1286
01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:18.290
<v Speaker 1>he had enormous gravitas.</v>

1287
01:10:18.530 --> 01:10:23.530
<v Speaker 1>This guy was a serious intellectual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think this is a end of one study,</v>

1288
01:10:24.230 --> 01:10:29.230
<v Speaker 1>one individual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think this is something that </v>

1289
01:10:29.230 --> 01:10:29.230
<v Speaker 1>medical researchers did you pay </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention to.</v>

1290
01:10:29.230 --> 01:10:33.440
<v Speaker 1>What do you think could possibly </v>
<v Speaker 1>regenerate anything that quickly though,</v>

1291
01:10:33.500 --> 01:10:37.910
<v Speaker 1>like how could it happen so quickly that</v>
<v Speaker 1>during the excited for our trip,</v>

1292
01:10:37.970 --> 01:10:42.970
<v Speaker 1>because they're like nodes of crossing </v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's an interconnectedness that </v>

1293
01:10:42.970 --> 01:10:47.411
<v Speaker 1>occurs and there's a great graphic which</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't send you an advance showing </v>

1294
01:10:48.610 --> 01:10:52.720
<v Speaker 1>this is your brain without psilocybin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is your brain will whistles simon,</v>

1295
01:10:53.030 --> 01:10:56.390
<v Speaker 1>and there's a massive amount of neural </v>
<v Speaker 1>connections that are occurring.</v>

1296
01:10:56.660 --> 01:10:57.720
<v Speaker 1>so I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1297
01:10:58.120 --> 01:11:00.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1298
01:11:00.380 --> 01:11:02.810
<v Speaker 1>just like water chooses the path of </v>
<v Speaker 1>least resistance.</v>

1299
01:11:02.870 --> 01:11:04.880
<v Speaker 1>I think that neurologically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

1300
01:11:04.900 --> 01:11:09.900
<v Speaker 1>if there is a neurological pathway that </v>
<v Speaker 1>can help you as a species,</v>

1301
01:11:10.881 --> 01:11:15.881
<v Speaker 1>as an individual survive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>should there be a saber tooth tiger on </v>

1302
01:11:15.881 --> 01:11:19.791
<v Speaker 1>the horizon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I think that the economy of energy </v>

1303
01:11:19.791 --> 01:11:24.170
<v Speaker 1>in nature would reward the neurological </v>
<v Speaker 1>pathways that are most likely to lead to</v>

1304
01:11:25.231 --> 01:11:25.950
<v Speaker 1>your survival.</v>

1305
01:11:26.130 --> 01:11:31.130
<v Speaker 1>So I think that neurogenesis across the </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain occurred just like me with my </v>

1306
01:11:31.130 --> 01:11:33.090
<v Speaker 1>stuttering and there was another </v>
<v Speaker 1>neurological pathway.</v>

1307
01:11:33.450 --> 01:11:38.450
<v Speaker 1>BuT in bill's case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he lost his access to those </v>

1308
01:11:38.450 --> 01:11:42.171
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the neuropathy became more resident and </v>

1309
01:11:42.931 --> 01:11:47.931
<v Speaker 1>prominent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what we're looking at these </v>

1310
01:11:47.931 --> 01:11:47.931
<v Speaker 1>images mean we just put jamie's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>best.</v>

1311
01:11:47.931 --> 01:11:49.380
<v Speaker 1>We're just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're looking at these images.</v>

1312
01:11:49.381 --> 01:11:51.390
<v Speaker 1>And could you explain to us what these </v>
<v Speaker 1>are?</v>

1313
01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:55.110
<v Speaker 1>This is your brain on magic mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

1314
01:11:55.111 --> 01:12:00.111
<v Speaker 1>Opposite of nancy reagan's mantra here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1315
01:12:00.361 --> 01:12:03.390
<v Speaker 1>this is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can push this up to your faces.</v>

1316
01:12:04.310 --> 01:12:06.690
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the placebos on the left.</v>

1317
01:12:06.720 --> 01:12:11.720
<v Speaker 1>This is your normal representation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>interconnectedness between the nodes of </v>

1318
01:12:11.731 --> 01:12:13.980
<v Speaker 1>your brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I try to explain this to people.</v>

1319
01:12:13.981 --> 01:12:16.480
<v Speaker 1>most of the people are just listening </v>
<v Speaker 1>rather than viewing.</v>

1320
01:12:16.490 --> 01:12:17.810
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>

1321
01:12:17.910 --> 01:12:22.910
<v Speaker 1>the one on the left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it basically shows the connections </v>

1322
01:12:22.910 --> 01:12:27.801
<v Speaker 1>between neuronal nodes that maybe on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>order of 40 or 50 different nodes of </v>

1323
01:12:29.071 --> 01:12:29.610
<v Speaker 1>crossing.</v>

1324
01:12:30.390 --> 01:12:35.390
<v Speaker 1>The one on the right with psilocybin is </v>
<v Speaker 1>literally in the hundreds and the nodes </v>

1325
01:12:35.971 --> 01:12:40.971
<v Speaker 1>of crossing not only are more of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the thickness of the lines speaks to</v>

1326
01:12:44.550 --> 01:12:49.290
<v Speaker 1>how robust those nodes are crossing are </v>
<v Speaker 1>for carrying neurological signals.</v>

1327
01:12:50.370 --> 01:12:52.140
<v Speaker 1>So this is pretty amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1328
01:12:52.141 --> 01:12:57.141
<v Speaker 1>this also influences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think is important for our us </v>

1329
01:12:57.141 --> 01:12:58.450
<v Speaker 1>military,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1330
01:12:58.650 --> 01:13:00.480
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for coders,</v>

1331
01:13:01.290 --> 01:13:06.290
<v Speaker 1>for people who are trying to solve very </v>
<v Speaker 1>complex data sets.</v>

1332
01:13:07.020 --> 01:13:11.070
<v Speaker 1>The ability of you to have increased </v>
<v Speaker 1>cognition and increased intelligence,</v>

1333
01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:14.880
<v Speaker 1>and this is why microdosing is the rage </v>
<v Speaker 1>in silicon valley.</v>

1334
01:13:15.430 --> 01:13:20.430
<v Speaker 1>Enormous number of coders are </v>
<v Speaker 1>microdosing right now and for those who </v>

1335
01:13:20.430 --> 01:13:24.621
<v Speaker 1>are listening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this loose use philosophy cubensis as </v>

1336
01:13:24.621 --> 01:13:27.711
<v Speaker 1>the standard species because that's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>one that's mostly grown and at a half a </v>

1337
01:13:29.101 --> 01:13:31.320
<v Speaker 1>gram to a quarter gram you have lift </v>
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>

1338
01:13:31.890 --> 01:13:34.830
<v Speaker 1>Five grams is the full blown hero's </v>
<v Speaker 1>journey.</v>

1339
01:13:35.550 --> 01:13:39.960
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people will take between two </v>
<v Speaker 1>and four grams as a moderately spiritual</v>

1340
01:13:40.020 --> 01:13:40.650
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>

1341
01:13:40.650 --> 01:13:45.650
<v Speaker 1>Four grams being higher and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>microdosing is is taking a dose so low </v>

1342
01:13:50.790 --> 01:13:55.290
<v Speaker 1>that if at most you might feel it a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit giddy the first time you take</v>

1343
01:13:55.291 --> 01:14:00.291
<v Speaker 1>it the first day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you build up a tolerance </v>

1344
01:14:00.291 --> 01:14:00.291
<v Speaker 1>immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second day,</v>

1345
01:14:00.291 --> 01:14:03.570
<v Speaker 1>second day you feel nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's on the order of a 10th of a </v>

1346
01:14:03.570 --> 01:14:06.801
<v Speaker 1>gram of cubensis Where people are taking</v>
<v Speaker 1>this and then they're taking it </v>

1347
01:14:08.131 --> 01:14:13.131
<v Speaker 1>repeatedly over time and coders in </v>
<v Speaker 1>silicon valley from the biggest computer</v>

1348
01:14:16.750 --> 01:14:21.750
<v Speaker 1>companies that we all know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a not only a fashion but a tool </v>

1349
01:14:24.340 --> 01:14:29.340
<v Speaker 1>that they are seeing an increased </v>
<v Speaker 1>ability for coming up with codes and as </v>

1350
01:14:29.340 --> 01:14:30.670
<v Speaker 1>a competitive advantage in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>capitalistic system.</v>

1351
01:14:31.210 --> 01:14:36.210
<v Speaker 2>I have a good friend who's a world </v>
<v Speaker 2>champion kickboxer and one of the best </v>

1352
01:14:36.210 --> 01:14:39.391
<v Speaker 2>in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He microdose is daily and he's been </v>

1353
01:14:39.391 --> 01:14:41.110
<v Speaker 2>doing it over the last leg,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to say probably year or so,</v>

1354
01:14:41.320 --> 01:14:46.320
<v Speaker 2>and he.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He has achieved phenomenal improvements </v>

1355
01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:46.320
<v Speaker 2>in his performance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because of that.</v>

1356
01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:48.520
<v Speaker 2>He says that when he's sparring,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's almost like he's psychic,</v>

1357
01:14:48.880 --> 01:14:50.890
<v Speaker 2>like he knows what people are going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do before they do it.</v>

1358
01:14:51.220 --> 01:14:53.560
<v Speaker 2>He said his mood is better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He feels better.</v>

1359
01:14:53.740 --> 01:14:58.330
<v Speaker 2>He just feels more balanced and he'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>take days off and when he takes days off</v>

1360
01:14:58.331 --> 01:15:03.331
<v Speaker 2>and even though he's completely sober </v>
<v Speaker 2>while he's microdosing because he's </v>

1361
01:15:03.331 --> 01:15:06.661
<v Speaker 2>really only microdosing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's something about taking days off </v>

1362
01:15:06.661 --> 01:15:07.840
<v Speaker 2>Where everything just feels like kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>shitty,</v>

1363
01:15:08.140 --> 01:15:09.640
<v Speaker 2>just doesn't feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he's like,</v>

1364
01:15:09.700 --> 01:15:10.690
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't.</v>

1365
01:15:10.780 --> 01:15:15.780
<v Speaker 2>I didn't take my microdose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so he takes it again and goes right </v>

1366
01:15:15.780 --> 01:15:16.840
<v Speaker 2>back to that place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he feels like he's in the matrix.</v>

1367
01:15:17.400 --> 01:15:22.400
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually it's probably good that he </v>

1368
01:15:22.400 --> 01:15:23.490
<v Speaker 1>interrupts it because it washes those </v>
<v Speaker 1>receptors clean of this all,</v>

1369
01:15:23.530 --> 01:15:28.530
<v Speaker 1>simon and the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think you should interrupt for </v>

1370
01:15:28.530 --> 01:15:28.530
<v Speaker 1>two days out of out of seven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so five days on,</v>

1371
01:15:28.531 --> 01:15:33.531
<v Speaker 1>two days off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm not making official </v>

1372
01:15:33.531 --> 01:15:35.601
<v Speaker 1>recommendations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying from from my my small </v>

1373
01:15:39.361 --> 01:15:41.180
<v Speaker 1>amount of knowledge on the subject,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>

1374
01:15:41.410 --> 01:15:46.410
<v Speaker 1>I think that makes sense and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>consistent with traditional chinese </v>

1375
01:15:46.410 --> 01:15:46.560
<v Speaker 1>medicine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also consistent for those of us who</v>

1376
01:15:46.561 --> 01:15:50.010
<v Speaker 1>drink coffee like myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You drink coffee for five days,</v>

1377
01:15:50.011 --> 01:15:55.011
<v Speaker 1>you take two days off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That next day is the strongest cup of </v>

1378
01:15:55.011 --> 01:15:55.011
<v Speaker 1>coffee you've had in a long time.</v>

1379
01:15:55.020 --> 01:15:57.960
<v Speaker 2>Me and my friends who are just coming to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the next podcast after this,</v>

1380
01:15:57.961 --> 01:16:01.500
<v Speaker 2>we just got done doing sober october.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So no alcohol,</v>

1381
01:16:01.501 --> 01:16:02.880
<v Speaker 2>no marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no nothing.</v>

1382
01:16:03.180 --> 01:16:07.500
<v Speaker 2>We drank coffee but that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when I stopped smoking marijuana,</v>

1383
01:16:07.501 --> 01:16:11.370
<v Speaker 2>the first thing that happened is my </v>
<v Speaker 2>dreams became rocket charged.</v>

1384
01:16:11.730 --> 01:16:14.130
<v Speaker 2>Like very biZarre,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like crazy,</v>

1385
01:16:14.131 --> 01:16:16.380
<v Speaker 2>lucid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>strange,</v>

1386
01:16:16.560 --> 01:16:21.560
<v Speaker 2>weird dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not lucid in the sense that controlled </v>

1387
01:16:21.560 --> 01:16:22.230
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but lucid in the sense that I realized I</v>

1388
01:16:22.231 --> 01:16:26.970
<v Speaker 2>was dreaming and I was just like having </v>
<v Speaker 2>incredibly vivid,</v>

1389
01:16:26.971 --> 01:16:31.971
<v Speaker 2>vibrant dreams and I would wake up from </v>
<v Speaker 2>them and be certain that what I had done</v>

1390
01:16:32.761 --> 01:16:37.761
<v Speaker 2>was real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I had one dream that I fell Asleep </v>

1391
01:16:37.761 --> 01:16:37.830
<v Speaker 2>on the couch and why I did fall asleep </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the couch.</v>

1392
01:16:37.831 --> 01:16:39.870
<v Speaker 2>But while I was asleep I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1393
01:16:39.930 --> 01:16:44.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm struggling to get this blanket over </v>
<v Speaker 2>me while I'm on the couch and I'm </v>

1394
01:16:44.930 --> 01:16:48.591
<v Speaker 2>pulling it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's stuck under the cushions and </v>

1395
01:16:48.591 --> 01:16:48.960
<v Speaker 2>I'm struggling and I kinda halfway got </v>
<v Speaker 2>it over me and I went to sleep again.</v>

1396
01:16:49.370 --> 01:16:50.430
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I woke up in the morning,</v>

1397
01:16:50.431 --> 01:16:52.950
<v Speaker 2>there was no blanket.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no blanket anywhere near me.</v>

1398
01:16:53.650 --> 01:16:58.650
<v Speaker 2>Didn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a lucid dream about covering </v>

1399
01:16:58.650 --> 01:17:00.990
<v Speaker 2>myself with a blanket while I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>sleeping on this couch.</v>

1400
01:17:01.470 --> 01:17:06.470
<v Speaker 2>Very strange and very primal dreams too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like being chased by wolves and running </v>

1401
01:17:08.191 --> 01:17:12.200
<v Speaker 2>into bears in and really bizarre,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

1402
01:17:12.201 --> 01:17:14.460
<v Speaker 2>very vibrant colors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1403
01:17:14.840 --> 01:17:19.840
<v Speaker 2>and apparently from what I've read,</v>
<v Speaker 2>marijuana does something to suppress rem</v>

1404
01:17:20.391 --> 01:17:24.490
<v Speaker 2>sleep and that in taking time off of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

1405
01:17:24.491 --> 01:17:26.720
<v Speaker 2>your rem sleep just gets jacked through </v>
<v Speaker 2>the roof.</v>

1406
01:17:27.100 --> 01:17:28.370
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard this many,</v>

1407
01:17:28.371 --> 01:17:33.371
<v Speaker 1>many times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen in a clinical study on </v>

1408
01:17:33.371 --> 01:17:33.371
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's that type of thing.</v>

1409
01:17:33.371 --> 01:17:37.241
<v Speaker 1>You hear so many times that you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty good confidence that this is </v>

1410
01:17:37.241 --> 01:17:37.241
<v Speaker 1>true.</v>

1411
01:17:37.241 --> 01:17:38.180
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we all experienced it.</v>

1412
01:17:38.240 --> 01:17:43.240
<v Speaker 2>All my friends who did it experienced at</v>
<v Speaker 2>ari in particular probably smokes as </v>

1413
01:17:43.240 --> 01:17:43.240
<v Speaker 2>much as I do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe more.</v>

1414
01:17:43.240 --> 01:17:44.090
<v Speaker 2>I'm he experienced it deeply.</v>

1415
01:17:44.280 --> 01:17:49.280
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad that you mentioned lucid dreams</v>
<v Speaker 1>because this is a nice segue to I think </v>

1416
01:17:49.280 --> 01:17:52.970
<v Speaker 1>the greatest discovery I've made up my </v>
<v Speaker 1>life and I want us all came through a </v>

1417
01:17:52.970 --> 01:17:54.540
<v Speaker 1>lucid dream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let me,</v>

1418
01:17:54.541 --> 01:17:59.541
<v Speaker 1>let me set the stage here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a colony collapse disorder is a </v>

1419
01:17:59.761 --> 01:18:02.190
<v Speaker 1>threat to worldwide food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>biosecurity,</v>

1420
01:18:02.280 --> 01:18:07.280
<v Speaker 1>and killing bees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bees around the world are being </v>

1421
01:18:07.280 --> 01:18:07.280
<v Speaker 1>decimated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say the name of the disorder again,</v>

1422
01:18:07.280 --> 01:18:12.200
<v Speaker 1>colony collapse disorder disorder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now bees are dying off in enormous </v>

1423
01:18:12.200 --> 01:18:16.290
<v Speaker 1>quantities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oklahoma lost 85 percent of his beehives</v>

1424
01:18:16.350 --> 01:18:19.740
<v Speaker 1>last year or this 2016,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2017.</v>

1425
01:18:20.010 --> 01:18:25.010
<v Speaker 1>The annual loss of bees report and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Maryland lost 75 percent.</v>

1426
01:18:27.420 --> 01:18:32.420
<v Speaker 1>Nebraska I think lost 60 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I met a beekeeper in Washington state </v>

1427
01:18:32.420 --> 01:18:33.930
<v Speaker 1>who lost 75 percent of his 35,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>hives.</v>

1428
01:18:34.680 --> 01:18:39.680
<v Speaker 1>Now apex mila for is the honeybee and </v>
<v Speaker 1>this factory farm now and the almond </v>

1429
01:18:39.901 --> 01:18:44.901
<v Speaker 1>harvest in California is the biggest </v>
<v Speaker 1>market for beekeepers who send their </v>

1430
01:18:45.061 --> 01:18:47.310
<v Speaker 1>bees to the almond orchards.</v>

1431
01:18:47.580 --> 01:18:51.360
<v Speaker 1>One bee component,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a thousand flowers and a day,</v>

1432
01:18:51.780 --> 01:18:55.140
<v Speaker 1>so every flower that bee visits is an </v>
<v Speaker 1>almond,</v>

1433
01:18:55.740 --> 01:18:58.560
<v Speaker 1>so it's one of the most bee dependent </v>
<v Speaker 1>crops in the world.</v>

1434
01:18:58.590 --> 01:19:03.180
<v Speaker 1>Thirty five percent of your food is </v>
<v Speaker 1>directly dependent upon bee pollination.</v>

1435
01:19:03.720 --> 01:19:07.740
<v Speaker 1>The other 65 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much of that is indirectly dependent,</v>

1436
01:19:08.100 --> 01:19:11.490
<v Speaker 1>but hay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>alfalfa and clover for cows.</v>

1437
01:19:12.030 --> 01:19:14.700
<v Speaker 1>All of our dairy is dependent upon bee </v>
<v Speaker 1>pollination.</v>

1438
01:19:14.970 --> 01:19:17.010
<v Speaker 1>All of our berries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of our nuts,</v>

1439
01:19:17.490 --> 01:19:22.490
<v Speaker 1>coffee is even cannabis and other non </v>
<v Speaker 1>dependent plants benefit from what's </v>

1440
01:19:25.351 --> 01:19:30.351
<v Speaker 1>called buzz pollination because the bees</v>
<v Speaker 1>then can spread the pollen better </v>

1441
01:19:30.351 --> 01:19:35.150
<v Speaker 1>through the error.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is now a thought by many of the </v>

1442
01:19:35.150 --> 01:19:40.131
<v Speaker 1>entomologist I've been dealing with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we could have full colony collapse </v>

1443
01:19:40.131 --> 01:19:42.270
<v Speaker 1>across the world within 10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The cost,</v>

1444
01:19:42.480 --> 01:19:47.480
<v Speaker 1>it will be astronomical to our society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Prices where food will raise poverty </v>

1445
01:19:47.701 --> 01:19:52.701
<v Speaker 1>will increase.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could make the argument that </v>

1446
01:19:52.701 --> 01:19:54.060
<v Speaker 1>increased poverty leads to terrorism </v>
<v Speaker 1>because people are poorer,</v>

1447
01:19:54.210 --> 01:19:58.680
<v Speaker 1>they're desperate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so colony collapse now is much worse</v>

1448
01:19:58.681 --> 01:20:02.610
<v Speaker 1>than most people realize because all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>wild bees have now been infected.</v>

1449
01:20:03.120 --> 01:20:08.120
<v Speaker 1>So 80 percent of pollination services </v>
<v Speaker 1>come from wild bees and 20 percent from </v>

1450
01:20:08.120 --> 01:20:12.410
<v Speaker 1>managed honeybees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eva's [inaudible] is from a honey bee </v>

1451
01:20:12.410 --> 01:20:14.400
<v Speaker 1>from europe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brought over in the 17 hundreds in 1984.</v>

1452
01:20:14.401 --> 01:20:19.401
<v Speaker 1>The varroa mite was introduced in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>United States and the varroa mite has is</v>

1453
01:20:19.521 --> 01:20:24.521
<v Speaker 1>like a is a parasite on the backs of </v>
<v Speaker 1>bees and injects viruses and </v>

1454
01:20:24.521 --> 01:20:27.630
<v Speaker 1>particularly the deformed wing virus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lake sinai virus,</v>

1455
01:20:27.660 --> 01:20:32.660
<v Speaker 1>and the black queen cell virus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Deformed wing virus is the really </v>

1456
01:20:32.660 --> 01:20:36.021
<v Speaker 1>the most important one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bees used to go and they only live 30 </v>

1457
01:20:36.021 --> 01:20:40.251
<v Speaker 1>days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now they used to go pollinating for </v>

1458
01:20:40.251 --> 01:20:43.161
<v Speaker 1>nine days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they leave the hive and they </v>

1459
01:20:43.161 --> 01:20:44.580
<v Speaker 1>pollinate for about nine days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd bring back pollen and uh,</v>

1460
01:20:44.610 --> 01:20:47.010
<v Speaker 1>that's their service to the hive and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they die off.</v>

1461
01:20:47.370 --> 01:20:50.370
<v Speaker 1>Now the average time for pollination is </v>
<v Speaker 1>only four days.</v>

1462
01:20:51.150 --> 01:20:56.150
<v Speaker 1>The order to fight the mites,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've been using a toxic insecticide </v>

1463
01:20:56.150 --> 01:20:56.260
<v Speaker 1>called emma.</v>

1464
01:20:56.830 --> 01:21:00.360
<v Speaker 1>EMma tries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fights is licensed for fighting ticks on</v>

1465
01:21:00.361 --> 01:21:05.130
<v Speaker 1>cattle using cattle strength doses of </v>
<v Speaker 1>ama tries off label.</v>

1466
01:21:05.430 --> 01:21:08.970
<v Speaker 1>Beekeepers have been drenching their </v>
<v Speaker 1>hives with amtrust twice per year.</v>

1467
01:21:09.300 --> 01:21:13.050
<v Speaker 1>Now the mites have built up tolerance </v>
<v Speaker 1>and now they're up to nine times a year.</v>

1468
01:21:13.200 --> 01:21:18.200
<v Speaker 1>They're soaking the hives in order to </v>
<v Speaker 1>kill the mites because mites are </v>

1469
01:21:18.200 --> 01:21:18.810
<v Speaker 1>injecting these viruses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is all hands on deck.</v>

1470
01:21:19.170 --> 01:21:21.930
<v Speaker 1>This is the proverbial shit's gonna hit </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fan on.</v>

1471
01:21:21.931 --> 01:21:25.740
<v Speaker 1>This is an extremely important and </v>
<v Speaker 1>interestingly,</v>

1472
01:21:25.741 --> 01:21:28.740
<v Speaker 1>it's the number one bridge issue between</v>
<v Speaker 1>liberals and conservatives.</v>

1473
01:21:29.040 --> 01:21:31.770
<v Speaker 1>So when you're at thanksgiving dinner or</v>
<v Speaker 1>christmas or hanukkah,</v>

1474
01:21:32.160 --> 01:21:37.160
<v Speaker 1>if you want to avoid talking about trump</v>
<v Speaker 1>and politics and hillary or benghazi or </v>

1475
01:21:37.621 --> 01:21:39.310
<v Speaker 1>whatever that subject,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1476
01:21:39.630 --> 01:21:41.550
<v Speaker 1>dispute is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Talk about bees.</v>

1477
01:21:41.640 --> 01:21:44.160
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's on board on protecting the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bees.</v>

1478
01:21:44.520 --> 01:21:49.520
<v Speaker 1>So I had a waking dream first 1984.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had two beehives.</v>

1479
01:21:50.970 --> 01:21:55.970
<v Speaker 1>I planted a mushroom in my garden called</v>
<v Speaker 1>the garden giant and one time this </v>

1480
01:21:55.970 --> 01:22:00.591
<v Speaker 1>summer I came out to water my mushrooms </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was covered with bees and the </v>

1481
01:22:00.591 --> 01:22:05.181
<v Speaker 1>bees moved the wood chips aside and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>could see these white mycelium and they </v>

1482
01:22:05.181 --> 01:22:07.440
<v Speaker 1>were sipping on the little droplets of </v>
<v Speaker 1>oozing from the mycelium.</v>

1483
01:22:07.440 --> 01:22:11.730
<v Speaker 1>I got real excited and I kept a journal </v>
<v Speaker 1>and for fortY days from dawn to dusk,</v>

1484
01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:14.550
<v Speaker 1>there was a continuous convoy of bees to</v>
<v Speaker 1>my mushroom bed.</v>

1485
01:22:14.680 --> 01:22:17.250
<v Speaker 1>Does that edible edible mushrooms?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1486
01:22:17.430 --> 01:22:19.020
<v Speaker 1>and I made note of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I published it.</v>

1487
01:22:19.021 --> 01:22:20.940
<v Speaker 1>and then harris smith magazine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>1988.</v>

1488
01:22:20.941 --> 01:22:23.880
<v Speaker 1>I put it in one of my books in 1994.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I forgot about it.</v>

1489
01:22:24.930 --> 01:22:29.930
<v Speaker 1>So I got involved with us biosil </v>
<v Speaker 1>biodefense program directly after nine </v>

1490
01:22:29.930 --> 01:22:30.120
<v Speaker 1>slash 11.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can google my name,</v>

1491
01:22:30.121 --> 01:22:35.121
<v Speaker 1>stamets and smallpox.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a vetted press release from the </v>

1492
01:22:35.121 --> 01:22:35.121
<v Speaker 1>us government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

1493
01:22:35.340 --> 01:22:36.640
<v Speaker 1>we the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1494
01:22:36.780 --> 01:22:41.780
<v Speaker 1>did 2,200</v>
<v Speaker 1>plus analyses of our mushroom extracts </v>

1495
01:22:43.230 --> 01:22:48.230
<v Speaker 1>and we found extracts that were highly </v>
<v Speaker 1>active against flu viruses against </v>

1496
01:22:48.230 --> 01:22:51.030
<v Speaker 1>including bird flu against herpes and </v>
<v Speaker 1>against pox viruses,</v>

1497
01:22:51.031 --> 01:22:53.850
<v Speaker 1>including smallpox.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I have a patent that issued on,</v>

1498
01:22:53.851 --> 01:22:58.851
<v Speaker 1>this is a great secondary story because </v>
<v Speaker 1>I had black hawk helicopters coming over</v>

1499
01:22:59.641 --> 01:23:00.930
<v Speaker 1>my laboratory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all this other stuff.</v>

1500
01:23:04.930 --> 01:23:09.930
<v Speaker 1>So it's a true conspiracy story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I had published this research on the </v>

1501
01:23:11.681 --> 01:23:13.930
<v Speaker 1>antiviral properties of mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mycelium,</v>

1502
01:23:14.440 --> 01:23:17.330
<v Speaker 1>and then I heard about the bees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1503
01:23:17.340 --> 01:23:18.910
<v Speaker 1>I'd raised bees and then a friend of </v>
<v Speaker 1>mine,</v>

1504
01:23:18.911 --> 01:23:23.911
<v Speaker 1>louie schwartzberg,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're doing a movie called fantastic </v>

1505
01:23:23.911 --> 01:23:25.921
<v Speaker 1>fungi making for 10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And louie came to me and said,</v>

1506
01:23:26.351 --> 01:23:31.351
<v Speaker 1>paul,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have eight patents on fungi that can </v>

1507
01:23:31.351 --> 01:23:32.260
<v Speaker 1>control termites,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ants,</v>

1508
01:23:32.290 --> 01:23:34.840
<v Speaker 1>mosquitoes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can google right now.</v>

1509
01:23:34.841 --> 01:23:39.841
<v Speaker 1>Stamets can take down monsanto.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's probably a thousand websites </v>

1510
01:23:39.841 --> 01:23:41.050
<v Speaker 1>because my patents are disruptive </v>
<v Speaker 1>patents,</v>

1511
01:23:41.680 --> 01:23:46.420
<v Speaker 1>so I can very much control termites.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ants from consuming your house for about</v>

1512
01:23:46.421 --> 01:23:51.421
<v Speaker 1>twenty cents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I met with all the big companies </v>

1513
01:23:51.421 --> 01:23:51.421
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but anyhow,</v>

1514
01:23:51.421 --> 01:23:55.150
<v Speaker 1>so louie knew about my research on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've spoken on this before and he said,</v>

1515
01:23:55.151 --> 01:23:56.740
<v Speaker 1>paul,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mites are killing the bees,</v>

1516
01:23:57.400 --> 01:23:58.960
<v Speaker 1>can't you do something to help the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mites?</v>

1517
01:23:59.770 --> 01:24:02.950
<v Speaker 1>And so now that's two stories.</v>

1518
01:24:02.950 --> 01:24:06.040
<v Speaker 1>We have this bio shield biodefense story</v>
<v Speaker 1>and my antiviral stuff.</v>

1519
01:24:06.041 --> 01:24:11.041
<v Speaker 1>We have me growing the mushrooms in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>garden and a hike in the old growth </v>

1520
01:24:11.041 --> 01:24:13.390
<v Speaker 1>forest a lot and I'm hiking the old </v>
<v Speaker 1>growth for us.</v>

1521
01:24:13.510 --> 01:24:17.000
<v Speaker 1>And the way I orienteer it'S one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>few skill sets I have.</v>

1522
01:24:17.230 --> 01:24:22.230
<v Speaker 1>I like just getting off trail and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>the south fork of the hoh river and I'm </v>

1523
01:24:22.330 --> 01:24:27.330
<v Speaker 1>deep in the old growth forest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I come around a corner and I see a bear </v>

1524
01:24:27.330 --> 01:24:27.330
<v Speaker 1>strike.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The bear came up,</v>

1525
01:24:27.520 --> 01:24:28.990
<v Speaker 1>bam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>scratched this tree,</v>

1526
01:24:29.470 --> 01:24:33.250
<v Speaker 1>huge paw strike in the tree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I told my wife,</v>

1527
01:24:33.490 --> 01:24:34.120
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1528
01:24:35.410 --> 01:24:40.410
<v Speaker 1>the Washington state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the school system is dependent upon </v>

1529
01:24:40.410 --> 01:24:43.120
<v Speaker 1>funding from selling timber to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>lumber,</v>

1530
01:24:43.150 --> 01:24:48.150
<v Speaker 1>lumber companies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the school system dependent upon </v>

1531
01:24:48.150 --> 01:24:48.250
<v Speaker 1>timber harvest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>off of public lands.</v>

1532
01:24:48.850 --> 01:24:50.980
<v Speaker 1>So in humans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great wisdom.</v>

1533
01:24:51.760 --> 01:24:56.760
<v Speaker 1>They decided that the bears were </v>
<v Speaker 1>jeopardizing the educational funds in </v>

1534
01:24:57.041 --> 01:25:02.041
<v Speaker 1>Washington state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they hired hunters to kill all the </v>

1535
01:25:02.041 --> 01:25:02.041
<v Speaker 1>bears.</v>

1536
01:25:02.041 --> 01:25:06.120
<v Speaker 1>So my neighbor killed 400 bears.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why we have a salmon run right </v>

1537
01:25:06.120 --> 01:25:08.290
<v Speaker 1>now on [inaudible] inlet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then chemistry point Washington,</v>

1538
01:25:08.470 --> 01:25:11.740
<v Speaker 1>there's no bears around because they saw</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bears,</v>

1539
01:25:11.741 --> 01:25:15.580
<v Speaker 1>the threat to the economic stability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this whole system and why the bears when</v>

1540
01:25:15.581 --> 01:25:20.581
<v Speaker 1>they scratch the trees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it become an entry room for a poly pore </v>

1541
01:25:20.581 --> 01:25:20.830
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I told my wife,</v>

1542
01:25:21.310 --> 01:25:26.310
<v Speaker 1>if this is true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's come back in two years and see if </v>

1543
01:25:26.310 --> 01:25:26.310
<v Speaker 1>this [inaudible] mushroom is growing </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

1544
01:25:26.310 --> 01:25:28.330
<v Speaker 1>These are woodcock similar to the one my</v>
<v Speaker 1>hat is made from.</v>

1545
01:25:28.930 --> 01:25:32.320
<v Speaker 1>So we came back two years later and sure</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough this wood conk was growing out of</v>

1546
01:25:32.321 --> 01:25:33.400
<v Speaker 1>the tree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The tree had died,</v>

1547
01:25:33.401 --> 01:25:36.970
<v Speaker 1>so they kind of got it right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when bears scratch trees,</v>

1548
01:25:37.180 --> 01:25:40.570
<v Speaker 1>resin comes out and bees are attracted </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the propolis,</v>

1549
01:25:40.600 --> 01:25:43.630
<v Speaker 1>to make propolis from the residence to </v>
<v Speaker 1>pastor hives from cracks,</v>

1550
01:25:43.840 --> 01:25:45.760
<v Speaker 1>to prevent invaders coming into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>beehive.</v>

1551
01:25:46.690 --> 01:25:50.200
<v Speaker 1>These orals seemingly disparate stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is why this waking dream put it</v>

1552
01:25:50.201 --> 01:25:55.201
<v Speaker 1>all together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I have my garden giant in bed with </v>

1553
01:25:55.201 --> 01:25:59.620
<v Speaker 1>the bees are coming to the [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 1>biodefense program where I found these </v>

1554
01:25:59.620 --> 01:26:00.610
<v Speaker 1>extracts are highly active against </v>
<v Speaker 1>viruses,</v>

1555
01:26:01.660 --> 01:26:04.760
<v Speaker 1>bear scratched trees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>introduce poly pore mushrooms,</v>

1556
01:26:05.930 --> 01:26:08.360
<v Speaker 1>and then with my friend louie </v>
<v Speaker 1>schwartzberg is saying,</v>

1557
01:26:08.361 --> 01:26:13.361
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can you help the bees so and now I </v>

1558
01:26:13.361 --> 01:26:16.921
<v Speaker 1>highly recommend this to everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listening is these lucid dream state at </v>

1559
01:26:16.921 --> 01:26:21.671
<v Speaker 1>that state when you're fully asleep and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you just go into the ether of </v>

1560
01:26:21.671 --> 01:26:23.420
<v Speaker 1>wakefulness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stay there,</v>

1561
01:26:24.380 --> 01:26:29.380
<v Speaker 1>reside there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have random access memory before you </v>

1562
01:26:29.380 --> 01:26:32.480
<v Speaker 1>get your neurological pathways all set </v>
<v Speaker 1>up by habit of what you're going to do.</v>

1563
01:26:33.020 --> 01:26:38.020
<v Speaker 1>Just exist in that space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I had synopsis activate a new </v>

1564
01:26:38.901 --> 01:26:40.850
<v Speaker 1>neurological pathway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had an epiphany.</v>

1565
01:26:40.851 --> 01:26:42.290
<v Speaker 1>I think I know how to save the bees.</v>

1566
01:26:43.070 --> 01:26:47.060
<v Speaker 1>Fast forward now I have multiple patents</v>
<v Speaker 1>issuing all over the world.</v>

1567
01:26:47.990 --> 01:26:50.570
<v Speaker 1>We've done research for Washington state</v>
<v Speaker 1>university.</v>

1568
01:26:51.080 --> 01:26:53.810
<v Speaker 1>We've gathered two point $5,</v>
<v Speaker 1>million dollars.</v>

1569
01:26:53.811 --> 01:26:58.811
<v Speaker 1>You can go to wsu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>www dot b's dot w s u.edu.</v>

1570
01:27:02.660 --> 01:27:05.450
<v Speaker 1>So the wasn't the university.edu</v>
<v Speaker 1>for education.</v>

1571
01:27:06.650 --> 01:27:08.150
<v Speaker 1>And you'll see the resource that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>

1572
01:27:08.151 --> 01:27:13.151
<v Speaker 1>There we are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I have found that the extracts of </v>

1573
01:27:13.151 --> 01:27:18.101
<v Speaker 1>amadou,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one my hat is made from doubles the </v>

1574
01:27:18.141 --> 01:27:23.141
<v Speaker 1>lifespans of bees and reduces the </v>
<v Speaker 1>deformed wing virus by more than a </v>

1575
01:27:23.141 --> 01:27:26.420
<v Speaker 1>thousand fold in 10 days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hit joe,</v>

1576
01:27:26.421 --> 01:27:29.150
<v Speaker 1>the [inaudible] home run.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not an entomologist.</v>

1577
01:27:29.810 --> 01:27:32.330
<v Speaker 1>I have two beehives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a big beekeeper,</v>

1578
01:27:33.170 --> 01:27:37.850
<v Speaker 1>but I put these thoughts together that </v>
<v Speaker 1>if these mushroom extracts,</v>

1579
01:27:37.851 --> 01:27:40.700
<v Speaker 1>reduced viruses that harm humans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pigs and birds,</v>

1580
01:27:41.090 --> 01:27:43.310
<v Speaker 1>what would they do with bees?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now?</v>

1581
01:27:43.311 --> 01:27:48.311
<v Speaker 1>We all grew up with winnie the pooh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so my us patent issued this past year </v>

1582
01:27:48.470 --> 01:27:51.740
<v Speaker 1>and now it's issued in Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>United States issuing in europe,</v>

1583
01:27:51.750 --> 01:27:52.880
<v Speaker 1>eurasia and Canada.</v>

1584
01:27:53.090 --> 01:27:55.100
<v Speaker 1>I plan to open source it for the rest of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world,</v>

1585
01:27:55.670 --> 01:28:00.670
<v Speaker 1>but I was waiting on pins and needles </v>
<v Speaker 1>because certainly it would be something </v>

1586
01:28:00.670 --> 01:28:03.551
<v Speaker 1>called prior art.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Patents are issued for and based on </v>

1587
01:28:03.621 --> 01:28:05.450
<v Speaker 1>several criteria.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>

1588
01:28:05.451 --> 01:28:07.220
<v Speaker 1>no prior art,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one's ever mentioned it.</v>

1589
01:28:08.030 --> 01:28:10.310
<v Speaker 1>Secondly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>contrary to conventional wisdom,</v>

1590
01:28:10.730 --> 01:28:13.100
<v Speaker 1>so if you invented the bicycle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wheel,</v>

1591
01:28:13.160 --> 01:28:15.170
<v Speaker 1>then you came up with a tricycle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not patentable.</v>

1592
01:28:15.350 --> 01:28:18.560
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty obvious because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>logical.</v>

1593
01:28:18.770 --> 01:28:19.990
<v Speaker 1>So you want something as.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1594
01:28:20.020 --> 01:28:25.020
<v Speaker 1>no evidence in the literature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>public or private or scientific or </v>

1595
01:28:25.020 --> 01:28:27.500
<v Speaker 1>popular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want it to contrary to conventional,</v>

1596
01:28:27.530 --> 01:28:32.530
<v Speaker 1>conventional wisdom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means that you want experts to </v>

1597
01:28:32.530 --> 01:28:36.131
<v Speaker 1>teach away from your invention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So every time someone out there and </v>

1598
01:28:36.131 --> 01:28:36.131
<v Speaker 1>tells me that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that tells,</v>

1599
01:28:36.140 --> 01:28:39.050
<v Speaker 1>I hear that paul stamets is full of </v>
<v Speaker 1>crap.</v>

1600
01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:42.560
<v Speaker 1>Nothing he says is true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have one great response.</v>

1601
01:28:42.590 --> 01:28:43.730
<v Speaker 1>I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank you.</v>

1602
01:28:44.180 --> 01:28:48.230
<v Speaker 1>You're helping my patentability because </v>
<v Speaker 1>the more experts that teach away from my</v>

1603
01:28:48.231 --> 01:28:51.110
<v Speaker 1>invention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more unconventional my invention is.</v>

1604
01:28:51.111 --> 01:28:54.500
<v Speaker 1>Hence the more patentable it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The third criteria is usefulness.</v>

1605
01:28:54.650 --> 01:28:57.110
<v Speaker 1>Benjamin franklin could not have </v>
<v Speaker 1>invented the iphone.</v>

1606
01:28:57.111 --> 01:28:59.360
<v Speaker 1>There's no usefulness and no self cell </v>
<v Speaker 1>towers.</v>

1607
01:28:59.630 --> 01:29:03.120
<v Speaker 1>So there's three criteria for 17 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It becomes open source.</v>

1608
01:29:03.360 --> 01:29:07.290
<v Speaker 1>So the idea is to incentivize inventors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why you have the iphone,</v>

1609
01:29:07.291 --> 01:29:08.460
<v Speaker 1>the droid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all your computers.</v>

1610
01:29:08.780 --> 01:29:13.780
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had one person call me up in a cell </v>

1611
01:29:13.780 --> 01:29:13.780
<v Speaker 1>phone and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how dare you patent this?</v>

1612
01:29:13.780 --> 01:29:15.420
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how dare you speak to me on a cell phone</v>

1613
01:29:15.421 --> 01:29:20.421
<v Speaker 1>that was enabled by a patent so you </v>
<v Speaker 1>could tell me that I shouldn't be </v>

1614
01:29:20.421 --> 01:29:20.421
<v Speaker 1>patenting things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just like,</v>

1615
01:29:20.610 --> 01:29:25.610
<v Speaker 1>the contradictions are pretty obvious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the patents and now have issued and </v>

1616
01:29:26.401 --> 01:29:31.401
<v Speaker 1>there was no prior art,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though we all grew up with winnie </v>

1617
01:29:31.401 --> 01:29:33.471
<v Speaker 1>the pooh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we knew that bears went into rotted </v>

1618
01:29:33.471 --> 01:29:33.960
<v Speaker 1>trees to find honey and beehives.</v>

1619
01:29:34.320 --> 01:29:39.320
<v Speaker 1>No one apparently until me made the </v>
<v Speaker 1>connection that bees are attracted to </v>

1620
01:29:39.320 --> 01:29:42.090
<v Speaker 1>the mycelium in rotted logs because of </v>
<v Speaker 1>immunological benefit.</v>

1621
01:29:42.390 --> 01:29:47.390
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's go back in time because this is a </v>

1622
01:29:47.390 --> 01:29:47.400
<v Speaker 1>very big picture concept here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twelve thousand years ago,</v>

1623
01:29:47.401 --> 01:29:49.980
<v Speaker 1>we invented agriculture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did we do?</v>

1624
01:29:50.280 --> 01:29:54.240
<v Speaker 1>We started to deforest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When we started cutting down the trees,</v>

1625
01:29:54.390 --> 01:29:59.220
<v Speaker 1>we began to dismantle the immunological </v>
<v Speaker 1>mycelial nets of nature.</v>

1626
01:30:00.030 --> 01:30:02.790
<v Speaker 1>Mycelium needs wood to decompose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You take away the wood.</v>

1627
01:30:02.791 --> 01:30:07.791
<v Speaker 1>There's mycelium doesn't have a habitat </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the mycelium is producing these </v>

1628
01:30:07.791 --> 01:30:09.570
<v Speaker 1>antiviral compounds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rotting the wood,</v>

1629
01:30:10.170 --> 01:30:12.870
<v Speaker 1>the bees were attracted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and because of deforestation,</v>

1630
01:30:12.871 --> 01:30:17.871
<v Speaker 1>now we're stressing the bees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's not only the lack of habitat </v>

1631
01:30:18.331 --> 01:30:23.331
<v Speaker 1>deforestation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's now neonicotinoids behr and </v>

1632
01:30:23.331 --> 01:30:26.661
<v Speaker 1>syngenta syngenta that produces neonics </v>
<v Speaker 1>as or known a toxic insecticide,</v>

1633
01:30:27.270 --> 01:30:32.270
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sponsored research in europe because </v>

1634
01:30:32.270 --> 01:30:32.270
<v Speaker 1>they didn't believe that new indicative </v>
<v Speaker 1>noise harm the bees.</v>

1635
01:30:32.310 --> 01:30:37.310
<v Speaker 1>There'll be research,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the researchers then finally published </v>

1636
01:30:37.310 --> 01:30:40.700
<v Speaker 1>when they got the results that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>contrary to the interests of syngenta </v>

1637
01:30:40.700 --> 01:30:41.550
<v Speaker 1>and bear that in fact neonicotinoids </v>
<v Speaker 1>harm.</v>

1638
01:30:41.550 --> 01:30:44.790
<v Speaker 1>The second and third generation is now </v>
<v Speaker 1>neonicotinoids are now banned in europe.</v>

1639
01:30:45.390 --> 01:30:47.010
<v Speaker 1>They are not banned in the United </v>
<v Speaker 1>States,</v>

1640
01:30:47.011 --> 01:30:50.190
<v Speaker 1>so you have drift of these new </v>
<v Speaker 1>indicative to whites on there,</v>

1641
01:30:50.191 --> 01:30:53.790
<v Speaker 1>Jason Fields,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you have loss of wood deforestation,</v>

1642
01:30:53.791 --> 01:30:56.640
<v Speaker 1>you have neonicotinoids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have gli phosphates,</v>

1643
01:30:56.700 --> 01:31:01.700
<v Speaker 1>whether they're associated with gmos </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they interfere with the </v>

1644
01:31:01.700 --> 01:31:01.700
<v Speaker 1>microbiome of the bees and their gut </v>
<v Speaker 1>flora,</v>

1645
01:31:01.700 --> 01:31:04.200
<v Speaker 1>so they can't detoxify.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's called the cytochrome p 4:50</v>

1646
01:31:04.201 --> 01:31:06.900
<v Speaker 1>pathway that we all have it breaking </v>
<v Speaker 1>down toxins.</v>

1647
01:31:07.110 --> 01:31:09.210
<v Speaker 1>So there's a confluence of multiple </v>
<v Speaker 1>stressors,</v>

1648
01:31:09.211 --> 01:31:14.211
<v Speaker 1>but the nail in the coffin by far is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>deformed wing virus and we have found </v>

1649
01:31:14.211 --> 01:31:16.830
<v Speaker 1>now the extracts of this one drop per </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousand drops.</v>

1650
01:31:17.130 --> 01:31:22.130
<v Speaker 1>One milliliter in a leader can reduce </v>
<v Speaker 1>the viruses in bees by more than a </v>

1651
01:31:22.130 --> 01:31:26.840
<v Speaker 1>thousand fold and double the lifespan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a frigging homerun because it </v>

1652
01:31:26.840 --> 01:31:30.270
<v Speaker 1>protects food biosecurity around the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world at a time that food ecosystems are</v>

1653
01:31:30.271 --> 01:31:30.870
<v Speaker 1>collapsing.</v>

1654
01:31:31.170 --> 01:31:34.230
<v Speaker 1>But think of the bigger picture here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For millions of years,</v>

1655
01:31:34.231 --> 01:31:36.780
<v Speaker 1>we were forest people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We began deforestation.</v>

1656
01:31:36.781 --> 01:31:41.781
<v Speaker 1>When we got into agriculture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we began to dismantle the immunological </v>

1657
01:31:41.781 --> 01:31:42.570
<v Speaker 1>networks of nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mycelium,</v>

1658
01:31:42.571 --> 01:31:47.571
<v Speaker 1>this resident,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that these same mushrooms that </v>

1659
01:31:47.571 --> 01:31:48.090
<v Speaker 1>reduce viruses in bees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pigs,</v>

1660
01:31:49.110 --> 01:31:54.110
<v Speaker 1>birds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people speaks to me of a bigger concept </v>

1661
01:31:55.860 --> 01:32:00.860
<v Speaker 1>that the mycelium is part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>immunity of the and as we lose the </v>

1662
01:32:01.871 --> 01:32:04.660
<v Speaker 1>debris fields that the mycelium is </v>
<v Speaker 1>dependent upon,</v>

1663
01:32:04.661 --> 01:32:09.661
<v Speaker 1>we began to dismantle the immunological </v>
<v Speaker 1>health of our environment and zoonotic </v>

1664
01:32:09.941 --> 01:32:12.490
<v Speaker 1>diseases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>diseases coming from factory farms,</v>

1665
01:32:12.520 --> 01:32:15.460
<v Speaker 1>whether they're from pigs or chicken </v>
<v Speaker 1>farms.</v>

1666
01:32:15.940 --> 01:32:20.940
<v Speaker 1>And we have one extraordinary experiment</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this speaks to the black hawk </v>

1667
01:32:21.221 --> 01:32:26.221
<v Speaker 1>helicopter story is that I was working </v>
<v Speaker 1>with biosil biodefense program directly </v>

1668
01:32:26.981 --> 01:32:31.981
<v Speaker 1>after nine slash 11.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They contacted me because I wrote an </v>

1669
01:32:31.981 --> 01:32:35.190
<v Speaker 1>article that was a one page analysis of </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the research on the antiviral </v>

1670
01:32:36.251 --> 01:32:38.080
<v Speaker 1>properties of mushrooms in scientific </v>
<v Speaker 1>literature.</v>

1671
01:32:38.530 --> 01:32:40.990
<v Speaker 1>I wrote this article published in a peer</v>
<v Speaker 1>reviewed journal.</v>

1672
01:32:41.560 --> 01:32:45.190
<v Speaker 1>Bioterrorism became the front and center</v>
<v Speaker 1>of concern of the us defense department.</v>

1673
01:32:45.790 --> 01:32:50.790
<v Speaker 1>A group of radiologists saw my article </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they got funded by dick cheney and </v>

1674
01:32:51.671 --> 01:32:53.910
<v Speaker 1>George Bush and I have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1675
01:32:54.040 --> 01:32:59.040
<v Speaker 1>I want to say thank you ironically to </v>
<v Speaker 1>those two because they funded the bio </v>

1676
01:32:59.040 --> 01:33:03.581
<v Speaker 1>shield is called project biodefense and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they funded it with several billion </v>

1677
01:33:03.581 --> 01:33:08.040
<v Speaker 1>dollars and they contacted me because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>knew I had this large library of about </v>

1678
01:33:08.040 --> 01:33:09.220
<v Speaker 1>700 strains of mushrooms in our culture </v>
<v Speaker 1>library.</v>

1679
01:33:09.221 --> 01:33:14.221
<v Speaker 1>We have a company of 78 great employees </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we had this large library,</v>

1680
01:33:16.751 --> 01:33:21.751
<v Speaker 1>so they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we want to test your library based on </v>

1681
01:33:21.751 --> 01:33:24.871
<v Speaker 1>this article that you've written,</v>
<v Speaker 1>showing there are antiviral properties </v>

1682
01:33:24.871 --> 01:33:24.871
<v Speaker 1>in some mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have a lot of them.</v>

1683
01:33:25.060 --> 01:33:27.760
<v Speaker 1>Let's test your library to see if we </v>
<v Speaker 1>have antiviral properties.</v>

1684
01:33:28.390 --> 01:33:33.390
<v Speaker 1>So great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I started making extracts of </v>

1685
01:33:33.390 --> 01:33:33.390
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fruit bodies,</v>

1686
01:33:33.390 --> 01:33:37.981
<v Speaker 1>the mycelium,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the little filamentous fuzzy stuff that </v>

1687
01:33:37.981 --> 01:33:40.171
<v Speaker 1>gives rise to mushrooms and I sent off a</v>
<v Speaker 1>hundred extracts at a time all coded </v>

1688
01:33:41.070 --> 01:33:42.700
<v Speaker 1>with alphanumeric codes.</v>

1689
01:33:42.970 --> 01:33:47.970
<v Speaker 1>So they didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The government didn't know how sending </v>

1690
01:33:47.970 --> 01:33:48.550
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I get the first reports come back and</v>

1691
01:33:48.551 --> 01:33:50.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm flipping through them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No activity,</v>

1692
01:33:50.801 --> 01:33:55.801
<v Speaker 1>no activity against pox viruses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because by far the concern was smallpox </v>

1693
01:33:56.110 --> 01:34:00.160
<v Speaker 1>the biggest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have no immunological defense against</v>

1694
01:34:00.161 --> 01:34:01.050
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1695
01:34:01.570 --> 01:34:06.570
<v Speaker 1>after 1974 they stopped immunizing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you have a smallpox vaccinaTion on </v>

1696
01:34:06.570 --> 01:34:08.560
<v Speaker 1>your arm is probably one of the last </v>
<v Speaker 1>ones that were getting it.</v>

1697
01:34:09.730 --> 01:34:14.730
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going through a night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come to sample 78 and it said high </v>

1698
01:34:14.730 --> 01:34:14.730
<v Speaker 1>activity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

1699
01:34:14.730 --> 01:34:15.970
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sample 81 high activity.</v>

1700
01:34:15.971 --> 01:34:17.340
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got really excited.</v>

1701
01:34:17.680 --> 01:34:19.570
<v Speaker 1>I looked at my notebook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the codes were,</v>

1702
01:34:19.840 --> 01:34:24.840
<v Speaker 1>and it was from this mushroom called </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] that grows exclusively in </v>

1703
01:34:24.840 --> 01:34:25.810
<v Speaker 1>the old growth forests of the pacific </v>
<v Speaker 1>northwest.</v>

1704
01:34:26.410 --> 01:34:29.410
<v Speaker 1>This is the longest living mushroom in </v>
<v Speaker 1>north America.</v>

1705
01:34:30.010 --> 01:34:35.010
<v Speaker 1>It's a perennial poly poor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks like a giant beehive by </v>

1706
01:34:35.010 --> 01:34:36.400
<v Speaker 1>coincidence up on a tree so you can get </v>
<v Speaker 1>a picture of jana.</v>

1707
01:34:37.270 --> 01:34:40.630
<v Speaker 1>And so a garrick on a g,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a r I,</v>

1708
01:34:40.631 --> 01:34:42.200
<v Speaker 1>k o,</v>
<v Speaker 1>n and a.</v>

1709
01:34:42.220 --> 01:34:47.220
<v Speaker 1>So I got real excited and I Was given a </v>
<v Speaker 1>contact person because he had one point </v>

1710
01:34:47.220 --> 01:34:48.310
<v Speaker 1>of contact with us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the defense department,</v>

1711
01:34:48.340 --> 01:34:50.500
<v Speaker 1>a physician,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I called him up saying,</v>

1712
01:34:50.510 --> 01:34:53.260
<v Speaker 1>these researchers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these research results are wonderful.</v>

1713
01:34:53.650 --> 01:34:55.210
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what research results?</v>

1714
01:34:55.240 --> 01:35:00.240
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>federal express just delivered me this </v>

1715
01:35:00.240 --> 01:35:00.240
<v Speaker 1>whole dossier and the first hundred </v>
<v Speaker 1>samples,</v>

1716
01:35:00.240 --> 01:35:00.530
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at that.</v>

1717
01:35:00.620 --> 01:35:02.360
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he goes,</v>

1718
01:35:02.361 --> 01:35:04.610
<v Speaker 1>you're not supposed to get those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am.</v>

1719
01:35:05.330 --> 01:35:06.020
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1720
01:35:06.110 --> 01:35:11.110
<v Speaker 1>I'll photocopy and send them to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he didn't think that was too funny,</v>

1721
01:35:11.240 --> 01:35:15.110
<v Speaker 1>but that's the us government sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 1>is not very well organized.</v>

1722
01:35:15.360 --> 01:35:16.850
<v Speaker 1>The left hand doesn't talk to the right </v>
<v Speaker 1>hand.</v>

1723
01:35:17.720 --> 01:35:20.840
<v Speaker 1>So we got these research results.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

1724
01:35:20.841 --> 01:35:25.841
<v Speaker 1>That looks like a stick up a dude's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this one is particularly unusual </v>

1725
01:35:26.121 --> 01:35:28.880
<v Speaker 1>because it was attached to an upper </v>
<v Speaker 1>branch.</v>

1726
01:35:28.881 --> 01:35:32.960
<v Speaker 1>It fell through the air,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hit the other branch and teeter tottered</v>

1727
01:35:33.350 --> 01:35:36.710
<v Speaker 1>and then it regrew it's mycelium and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>connected back into the mother.</v>

1728
01:35:36.711 --> 01:35:38.870
<v Speaker 1>Mycelium inside the tree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it grew two legs.</v>

1729
01:35:39.350 --> 01:35:44.350
<v Speaker 1>So this is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was first described by the ice </v>

1730
01:35:44.350 --> 01:35:47.821
<v Speaker 1>core.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It says 65 is ed as [inaudible] ad </v>

1731
01:35:47.821 --> 01:35:51.131
<v Speaker 1>longum vitam the elixir of long life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this has been used in greek </v>

1732
01:35:51.131 --> 01:35:52.300
<v Speaker 1>pharmacopoeia for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

1733
01:35:52.360 --> 01:35:54.480
<v Speaker 1>for thousands of years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So please get back to your store.</v>

1734
01:35:54.481 --> 01:35:55.580
<v Speaker 1>Sorry for the interruption.</v>

1735
01:35:57.630 --> 01:36:00.380
<v Speaker 1>It's one aisle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm up in Canada.</v>

1736
01:36:00.870 --> 01:36:04.730
<v Speaker 1>And one of my managers calls me up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>says paul,</v>

1737
01:36:04.731 --> 01:36:07.220
<v Speaker 1>there's a helicopter who are the </v>
<v Speaker 1>laboratories?</v>

1738
01:36:07.850 --> 01:36:08.570
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no big deal.</v>

1739
01:36:08.571 --> 01:36:11.480
<v Speaker 1>And helicopters come and go because no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really close.</v>

1740
01:36:11.481 --> 01:36:12.380
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how close?</v>

1741
01:36:12.381 --> 01:36:15.890
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen to go,</v>

1742
01:36:15.891 --> 01:36:17.000
<v Speaker 1>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really close.</v>

1743
01:36:17.001 --> 01:36:22.001
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are the numbers in the back of the </v>

1744
01:36:22.001 --> 01:36:22.001
<v Speaker 1>helicopter?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

1745
01:36:22.001 --> 01:36:22.160
<v Speaker 1>there are no numbers as a black hawk </v>
<v Speaker 1>helicopter.</v>

1746
01:36:22.600 --> 01:36:27.600
<v Speaker 1>And I went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my gosh now just because it was very </v>

1747
01:36:27.600 --> 01:36:30.911
<v Speaker 1>new in the program with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because when you have an antidote to a </v>

1748
01:36:31.071 --> 01:36:34.010
<v Speaker 1>weapon than it can be weaponized by </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrorists.</v>

1749
01:36:34.490 --> 01:36:36.980
<v Speaker 1>So they didn't know who.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not everybody in the government knew who</v>

1750
01:36:36.981 --> 01:36:41.981
<v Speaker 1>I was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though I was working with project </v>

1751
01:36:41.981 --> 01:36:44.111
<v Speaker 1>biodefense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was still sort of an unknown entity </v>

1752
01:36:44.111 --> 01:36:46.370
<v Speaker 1>and I filed a patent application on </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

1753
01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.160
<v Speaker 1>And so I told my manager,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1754
01:36:49.161 --> 01:36:50.150
<v Speaker 1>shut down the business.</v>

1755
01:36:50.300 --> 01:36:52.910
<v Speaker 1>Give everybody cultures of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>mushroom,</v>

1756
01:36:52.911 --> 01:36:57.911
<v Speaker 1>which was [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to know who has them shut </v>

1757
01:36:57.911 --> 01:36:57.911
<v Speaker 1>down the business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone spread.</v>

1758
01:36:57.911 --> 01:36:59.930
<v Speaker 1>So we decentralized ourselves at target.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But hold on,</v>

1759
01:37:00.020 --> 01:37:02.120
<v Speaker 1>let me stop you right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're in Canada,</v>

1760
01:37:02.690 --> 01:37:04.580
<v Speaker 1>Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the United States.</v>

1761
01:37:04.970 --> 01:37:08.150
<v Speaker 1>In Washington state and the helicopters </v>
<v Speaker 1>are flying over your lab,</v>

1762
01:37:08.151 --> 01:37:09.560
<v Speaker 1>what happens then?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1763
01:37:09.590 --> 01:37:12.710
<v Speaker 1>they were trying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were spooking us do it on purpose.</v>

1764
01:37:12.711 --> 01:37:17.711
<v Speaker 1>They were doing the purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were hovering to let you know </v>

1765
01:37:17.711 --> 01:37:17.711
<v Speaker 1>they're there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what they were doing.</v>

1766
01:37:17.711 --> 01:37:19.520
<v Speaker 1>I mean there are treetop level right </v>
<v Speaker 1>over the frigging laboratory.</v>

1767
01:37:20.220 --> 01:37:23.210
<v Speaker 1>So I had everyone go in their car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They asked everyone to go in their car,</v>

1768
01:37:23.211 --> 01:37:26.120
<v Speaker 1>shut down the business immediately and </v>
<v Speaker 1>decentralize us as a target.</v>

1769
01:37:26.570 --> 01:37:31.570
<v Speaker 1>So later on when I came back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I called the people in the defense </v>

1770
01:37:31.570 --> 01:37:33.350
<v Speaker 1>department saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell's going on here?</v>

1771
01:37:33.680 --> 01:37:34.970
<v Speaker 1>And they go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh geez,</v>

1772
01:37:34.971 --> 01:37:39.971
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes the left hand doesn't talk to </v>

1773
01:37:39.971 --> 01:37:39.971
<v Speaker 1>her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1774
01:37:39.971 --> 01:37:39.971
<v Speaker 1>Or sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So eventually.</v>

1775
01:37:40.120 --> 01:37:43.550
<v Speaker 1>So how did they find out that you just </v>
<v Speaker 1>from your patent filing with the patent?</v>

1776
01:37:43.700 --> 01:37:48.700
<v Speaker 1>I filed the patent and it disappeared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most patent applications when you file </v>

1777
01:37:48.700 --> 01:37:53.001
<v Speaker 1>them show up in the us patent homepage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>within a year or two I filed this patent</v>

1778
01:37:54.080 --> 01:37:57.060
<v Speaker 1>and four or five years later it still </v>
<v Speaker 1>had not been published.</v>

1779
01:37:57.600 --> 01:38:02.600
<v Speaker 1>So I get a hold of my patent attorney </v>
<v Speaker 1>who gets ahold of the patent office and </v>

1780
01:38:02.600 --> 01:38:05.901
<v Speaker 1>the us department of defense considered </v>
<v Speaker 1>it to be an act national security,</v>

1781
01:38:06.690 --> 01:38:10.620
<v Speaker 1>so they quarantined my patent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>took it out of the patent office,</v>

1782
01:38:10.920 --> 01:38:15.920
<v Speaker 1>and they so it could not be seen by </v>
<v Speaker 1>potential terrorists because then it </v>

1783
01:38:15.920 --> 01:38:20.600
<v Speaker 1>could have an antidote to smallpox.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I had to do an inner government,</v>

1784
01:38:20.640 --> 01:38:25.350
<v Speaker 1>a governmental agency,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trace to recall the patent from dod,</v>

1785
01:38:25.351 --> 01:38:30.351
<v Speaker 1>that meetings they let out to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>released because it was a natural </v>

1786
01:38:30.351 --> 01:38:30.351
<v Speaker 1>product.</v>

1787
01:38:30.351 --> 01:38:34.640
<v Speaker 1>And so the patent then was put back into</v>
<v Speaker 1>the patent application queue and it was </v>

1788
01:38:34.640 --> 01:38:37.950
<v Speaker 1>approved in 2013.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I filed it in 2004.</v>

1789
01:38:39.060 --> 01:38:44.060
<v Speaker 1>So we have now done work at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>university of Mississippi school of </v>

1790
01:38:44.060 --> 01:38:47.571
<v Speaker 1>pharmacy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've isolated two novel anti smallpox </v>

1791
01:38:47.571 --> 01:38:50.571
<v Speaker 1>molecules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We also have done work at the </v>

1792
01:38:50.571 --> 01:38:53.360
<v Speaker 1>tuberculosis research institute with Dr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scott France plow and university of </v>

1793
01:38:53.360 --> 01:38:55.020
<v Speaker 1>Illinois chicago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've identified a new anti-tuberculosis</v>

1794
01:38:55.190 --> 01:39:00.190
<v Speaker 1>molecule,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a garicoitz and [inaudible] time in </v>

1795
01:39:00.190 --> 01:39:02.400
<v Speaker 1>greek culture was used for treating </v>
<v Speaker 1>consumption later thought to be known as</v>

1796
01:39:02.401 --> 01:39:07.401
<v Speaker 1>tuberculosis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have found that extracts of this </v>

1797
01:39:07.401 --> 01:39:08.700
<v Speaker 1>mushroom are dually active against </v>
<v Speaker 1>bacteria and viruses.</v>

1798
01:39:09.030 --> 01:39:13.530
<v Speaker 1>Most people who die from viral pneumonia</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually die from bacterial pneumonia.</v>

1799
01:39:13.740 --> 01:39:18.740
<v Speaker 1>They get a viral infection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their immune system over amps and </v>

1800
01:39:18.740 --> 01:39:19.590
<v Speaker 1>response.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get flood,</v>

1801
01:39:19.650 --> 01:39:24.650
<v Speaker 1>lungs get flooded with liquid bacteria </v>
<v Speaker 1>setup and bacterial pneumonia usually </v>

1802
01:39:24.650 --> 01:39:27.060
<v Speaker 1>kills people who actually get a flu </v>
<v Speaker 1>virus.</v>

1803
01:39:27.060 --> 01:39:32.060
<v Speaker 1>They die from bacterial pneumonia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to find a natural product that's </v>

1804
01:39:32.060 --> 01:39:33.030
<v Speaker 1>dually active against viruses and </v>
<v Speaker 1>bacteria is medically significant.</v>

1805
01:39:33.031 --> 01:39:38.031
<v Speaker 1>So there's a good argument for natural </v>
<v Speaker 1>products because you have a consortium </v>

1806
01:39:38.031 --> 01:39:41.420
<v Speaker 1>of protective agents that are living in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this soup of this extract that can help </v>

1807
01:39:41.480 --> 01:39:46.480
<v Speaker 1>help protect you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this has now led onto our discovering</v>

1808
01:39:47.340 --> 01:39:50.760
<v Speaker 1>molecules active against hpv.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The human papilloma virus.</v>

1809
01:39:51.780 --> 01:39:56.780
<v Speaker 1>Seventy percent or more of women have </v>
<v Speaker 1>hpv controversial vaccine.</v>

1810
01:39:57.451 --> 01:39:59.560
<v Speaker 1>Apparently it's very dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1811
01:40:00.300 --> 01:40:02.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm not anti vaccination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not either,</v>

1812
01:40:02.681 --> 01:40:07.470
<v Speaker 1>but I'm curious why they don't recommend</v>
<v Speaker 1>the vaccine after the age of 24.</v>

1813
01:40:08.640 --> 01:40:13.640
<v Speaker 1>I can't wrap my mind around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they're just trying to prevent </v>

1814
01:40:13.640 --> 01:40:16.191
<v Speaker 1>infection from sexually active kids </v>
<v Speaker 1>while you're sexually active after the </v>

1815
01:40:16.191 --> 01:40:16.380
<v Speaker 1>age of 24.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why?</v>

1816
01:40:16.410 --> 01:40:18.390
<v Speaker 1>When they're sexually active before </v>
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>

1817
01:40:18.870 --> 01:40:23.870
<v Speaker 1>but if you were didn't have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>infection before 24 and you're still </v>

1818
01:40:23.870 --> 01:40:27.530
<v Speaker 1>active at the age of 24,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why wouldn't they recommend the </v>

1819
01:40:27.530 --> 01:40:27.530
<v Speaker 1>vaccination after the age of 24?</v>

1820
01:40:27.530 --> 01:40:32.240
<v Speaker 1>Maybe there's a good medical recommended</v>
<v Speaker 1>post 24 hours that we were just 24 also </v>

1821
01:40:32.240 --> 01:40:35.850
<v Speaker 1>post 24.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't recommend it because they </v>

1822
01:40:35.850 --> 01:40:35.850
<v Speaker 1>think maybe you already have it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the answer to that.</v>

1823
01:40:35.850 --> 01:40:40.430
<v Speaker 1>That's bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never been able to get someone to </v>

1824
01:40:40.430 --> 01:40:41.910
<v Speaker 1>explain to me why is it the case?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mushrooms can suppress the expression of</v>

1825
01:40:41.911 --> 01:40:45.360
<v Speaker 1>this is that we were saying the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ingredients within the mushrooms.</v>

1826
01:40:45.361 --> 01:40:50.361
<v Speaker 1>We have found five molecules </v>
<v Speaker 1>authenticated by nih virology as being </v>

1827
01:40:50.361 --> 01:40:52.560
<v Speaker 1>potently active against hpv.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which mushrooms,</v>

1828
01:40:53.220 --> 01:40:58.220
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the poly pores that I have been </v>

1829
01:40:58.220 --> 01:41:00.790
<v Speaker 1>talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a ratio air-con,</v>

1830
01:41:00.910 --> 01:41:04.690
<v Speaker 1>amadu are likely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't,</v>

1831
01:41:04.720 --> 01:41:09.720
<v Speaker 1>I can't say de facto,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of them to have varying amounts of </v>

1832
01:41:09.720 --> 01:41:13.441
<v Speaker 1>these constituents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So these mushroom extracts are huge </v>

1833
01:41:13.441 --> 01:41:16.441
<v Speaker 1>consortium of antiviral and </v>
<v Speaker 1>antibacterial compounds.</v>

1834
01:41:16.811 --> 01:41:18.130
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I mentioned,</v>

1835
01:41:18.131 --> 01:41:23.131
<v Speaker 1>this maybe 5 million species of fungi is</v>
<v Speaker 1>about 150,000</v>

1836
01:41:23.501 --> 01:41:26.680
<v Speaker 1>species of mushrooms we've identified </v>
<v Speaker 1>around 14,000,</v>

1837
01:41:27.220 --> 01:41:32.220
<v Speaker 1>so think of from a just from </v>
<v Speaker 1>experientials evidence over thousands of</v>

1838
01:41:32.350 --> 01:41:33.580
<v Speaker 1>years of human experimentation.</v>

1839
01:41:34.060 --> 01:41:37.750
<v Speaker 1>It'd be like you went into a library and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's 14,000</v>

1840
01:41:37.751 --> 01:41:40.030
<v Speaker 1>books in your library,</v>
<v Speaker 1>14,000</v>

1841
01:41:40.031 --> 01:41:43.210
<v Speaker 1>species,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and our ancestors started selecting each</v>

1842
01:41:43.211 --> 01:41:48.211
<v Speaker 1>of these species and testing them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've narrowed the field down to about </v>

1843
01:41:48.211 --> 01:41:52.081
<v Speaker 1>200 species of which 50 species are </v>
<v Speaker 1>superstars that have no adverse effects </v>

1844
01:41:53.291 --> 01:41:58.291
<v Speaker 1>to human ingestion that had been used </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a very long period of time and </v>

1845
01:41:58.900 --> 01:42:03.900
<v Speaker 1>within that set of 50 species we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>finding these mushrooms which have </v>

1846
01:42:03.900 --> 01:42:08.100
<v Speaker 1>tremendous potential health benefit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is why I'm so excited in the </v>

1847
01:42:10.931 --> 01:42:14.260
<v Speaker 1>field of mycology is we have </v>
<v Speaker 1>translational science.</v>

1848
01:42:14.261 --> 01:42:19.261
<v Speaker 1>We have applied mycology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think based on what we've </v>

1849
01:42:19.961 --> 01:42:24.961
<v Speaker 1>discovered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can make the argument that we should </v>

1850
01:42:24.961 --> 01:42:26.710
<v Speaker 1>save the old growth forest as a matter </v>
<v Speaker 1>of national defense.</v>

1851
01:42:27.460 --> 01:42:31.570
<v Speaker 1>Our fungal genomes are essential for our</v>
<v Speaker 1>future and present survival.</v>

1852
01:42:32.080 --> 01:42:35.440
<v Speaker 1>The more we eliminate these landscapes </v>
<v Speaker 1>of biodiversity,</v>

1853
01:42:35.650 --> 01:42:39.190
<v Speaker 1>the more really losing potential agents </v>
<v Speaker 1>that can fight disease,</v>

1854
01:42:39.640 --> 01:42:44.470
<v Speaker 1>and so this is something that I think we</v>
<v Speaker 1>can build a bridge between conservatives</v>

1855
01:42:44.471 --> 01:42:48.520
<v Speaker 1>and liberals because osama bin ladin and</v>
<v Speaker 1>have access to an old growth forest.</v>

1856
01:42:48.790 --> 01:42:53.790
<v Speaker 1>We did and we do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think this is really just </v>

1857
01:42:53.790 --> 01:42:58.471
<v Speaker 1>indicative of many other things that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>can discover if we pay attention to the </v>

1858
01:42:59.141 --> 01:43:03.580
<v Speaker 1>vast genomic resources we have in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>biodiversity of the ecosystems that are,</v>

1859
01:43:03.880 --> 01:43:04.810
<v Speaker 1>that are still intact.</v>

1860
01:43:05.190 --> 01:43:10.190
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you recommend for personal </v>

1861
01:43:10.190 --> 01:43:11.160
<v Speaker 2>consumpTion any particular mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any particular supplements?</v>

1862
01:43:11.910 --> 01:43:16.770
<v Speaker 1>I in terms of recommend recommendations </v>
<v Speaker 1>for gourmet mushrooms,</v>

1863
01:43:16.771 --> 01:43:21.771
<v Speaker 1>I can make those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In terms of recommendations for </v>

1864
01:43:21.771 --> 01:43:21.810
<v Speaker 1>medicinal mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I cannot make recommendations.</v>

1865
01:43:21.811 --> 01:43:26.040
<v Speaker 1>I'm legally tied by the fda.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I cannot make a recommendation.</v>

1866
01:43:26.240 --> 01:43:29.780
<v Speaker 2>Can you recommend a website that perhaps</v>
<v Speaker 2>would recommend?</v>

1867
01:43:31.760 --> 01:43:36.760
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do recommend eating gourmet mushrooms </v>

1868
01:43:36.760 --> 01:43:38.530
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for just for a sheet talky,</v>

1869
01:43:38.540 --> 01:43:41.570
<v Speaker 1>lion's mane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my talky and reishi and chaga,</v>

1870
01:43:41.680 --> 01:43:44.350
<v Speaker 2>and these all have medical benefits as </v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

1871
01:43:44.351 --> 01:43:44.930
<v Speaker 2>These all,</v>

1872
01:43:44.930 --> 01:43:49.930
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the difference between a </v>
<v Speaker 1>gourmet and a medicinal medicinal </v>

1873
01:43:49.930 --> 01:43:49.930
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mushrooms,</v>

1874
01:43:50.300 --> 01:43:53.750
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms are medicinal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mushrooms are medicinal.</v>

1875
01:43:54.440 --> 01:43:58.160
<v Speaker 1>Mushrooms are very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very medicinal.</v>

1876
01:43:58.370 --> 01:44:03.370
<v Speaker 1>The big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the big stars right now by far are </v>

1877
01:44:03.370 --> 01:44:04.220
<v Speaker 1>reishi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chaga,</v>

1878
01:44:04.490 --> 01:44:06.440
<v Speaker 1>and lion's mane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about portabella?</v>

1879
01:44:06.470 --> 01:44:08.390
<v Speaker 1>They taste too good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't be that good for you.</v>

1880
01:44:08.720 --> 01:44:11.060
<v Speaker 1>Poor bellows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a problem.</v>

1881
01:44:11.090 --> 01:44:16.090
<v Speaker 1>I knew all mush.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All mushrooms should be cooked and </v>

1882
01:44:16.401 --> 01:44:20.300
<v Speaker 1>portobellos in particular should be </v>
<v Speaker 1>cooked at high temperatures.</v>

1883
01:44:20.630 --> 01:44:25.630
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is a unfortunate google compound </v>

1884
01:44:25.630 --> 01:44:26.740
<v Speaker 1>called at garret.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1885
01:44:26.800 --> 01:44:31.800
<v Speaker 1>garret teens are hydrazine's that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>heat unstable.</v>

1886
01:44:32.480 --> 01:44:34.310
<v Speaker 1>So the good news is you should cook </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

1887
01:44:34.910 --> 01:44:38.660
<v Speaker 1>And if you cook them well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then those mushrooms are not a problem.</v>

1888
01:44:39.290 --> 01:44:44.290
<v Speaker 1>If you don't cook them well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then these hydrazine's are potentially </v>

1889
01:44:44.481 --> 01:44:46.070
<v Speaker 1>problematic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1890
01:44:46.160 --> 01:44:51.160
<v Speaker 1>nature's a numbers game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there are beneficial compounds that </v>

1891
01:44:51.160 --> 01:44:54.350
<v Speaker 1>in some balance may outweigh the </v>
<v Speaker 1>negative effects of the hydrazine's,</v>

1892
01:44:54.800 --> 01:44:58.010
<v Speaker 1>the garrett teens in these mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that jury is still out.</v>

1893
01:44:58.011 --> 01:45:01.910
<v Speaker 1>So what are the negative benefits or the</v>
<v Speaker 1>negative affects of this?</v>

1894
01:45:03.290 --> 01:45:08.290
<v Speaker 1>This is an explosive area of </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation and puts my life in danger.</v>

1895
01:45:11.001 --> 01:45:13.820
<v Speaker 1>So I reserve the right not to answer a </v>
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>

1896
01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.700
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't expect that.</v>

1897
01:45:17.300 --> 01:45:20.390
<v Speaker 1>It puts your life in danger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Talking about portabella mushrooms.</v>

1898
01:45:22.520 --> 01:45:25.850
<v Speaker 1>He's looking at me silently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will respectfully move on.</v>

1899
01:45:25.851 --> 01:45:28.730
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anybody who's interested,</v>

1900
01:45:28.731 --> 01:45:33.150
<v Speaker 1>just google that and get back to me </v>
<v Speaker 1>next.</v>

1901
01:45:33.200 --> 01:45:38.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to have a guy who was the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>height as paul and he's going to have a </v>

1902
01:45:38.200 --> 01:45:43.181
<v Speaker 1>mask on and we're going to have some </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of electric box that distorts his </v>

1903
01:45:43.181 --> 01:45:44.080
<v Speaker 1>voice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1904
01:45:44.280 --> 01:45:49.280
<v Speaker 1>but the good news there is lots of </v>
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms that have tremendous benefit </v>

1905
01:45:49.860 --> 01:45:54.860
<v Speaker 1>and compounds inside of portabella </v>
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms that are very beneficial and </v>

1906
01:45:54.860 --> 01:45:59.300
<v Speaker 1>in fact there is a positive study with </v>
<v Speaker 1>some breast cancer patients.</v>

1907
01:45:59.450 --> 01:46:04.310
<v Speaker 1>Breast cancer study showing that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>button mushrooms can confer benefits.</v>

1908
01:46:04.311 --> 01:46:06.300
<v Speaker 1>So there that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we.</v>

1909
01:46:06.410 --> 01:46:09.710
<v Speaker 1>We were funded by nih with a two point </v>
<v Speaker 1>$2,000,000</v>

1910
01:46:09.711 --> 01:46:14.711
<v Speaker 1>for a breast cancer clinical study on </v>
<v Speaker 1>Turkey tail mushrooms and Turkey tail </v>

1911
01:46:14.711 --> 01:46:17.810
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms are fantastic as adjuncts to </v>
<v Speaker 1>conventional therapy.</v>

1912
01:46:19.190 --> 01:46:24.190
<v Speaker 1>The clinical study that was conducted </v>
<v Speaker 1>funded by nih and the university of </v>

1913
01:46:25.011 --> 01:46:30.011
<v Speaker 1>Minnesota medical school and medical </v>
<v Speaker 1>college showed a dose response curve </v>

1914
01:46:30.050 --> 01:46:35.050
<v Speaker 1>specifically in supporting the immune </v>
<v Speaker 1>system by taking Turkey tail mushrooms </v>

1915
01:46:35.050 --> 01:46:37.100
<v Speaker 1>and the more you talk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more benefit there was.</v>

1916
01:46:37.800 --> 01:46:42.800
<v Speaker 1>I have a ted med talk that's very </v>
<v Speaker 1>popular in front of 800 physicians where</v>

1917
01:46:43.641 --> 01:46:48.641
<v Speaker 1>my mother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is challenged with advanced stage </v>

1918
01:46:48.641 --> 01:46:48.860
<v Speaker 1>four breast cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is now 90,</v>

1919
01:46:48.930 --> 01:46:53.930
<v Speaker 1>almost 93 years of age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She had advanced stage four breast </v>

1920
01:46:53.930 --> 01:46:57.180
<v Speaker 1>cancer when she was 84 years of age,</v>
<v Speaker 1>given less than a few months to live,</v>

1921
01:46:57.870 --> 01:47:01.110
<v Speaker 1>and she had metastasized tumors all over</v>
<v Speaker 1>her body.</v>

1922
01:47:01.170 --> 01:47:06.170
<v Speaker 1>Her breast was erupting with a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very bad carcinoma and she is alive well</v>

1923
01:47:07.890 --> 01:47:11.500
<v Speaker 1>and fully recovered today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She did.</v>

1924
01:47:11.580 --> 01:47:16.580
<v Speaker 1>She had chemotherapy using herceptin and</v>
<v Speaker 1>little short time taxol.</v>

1925
01:47:16.740 --> 01:47:21.740
<v Speaker 1>She had a very bad reaction to taxol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a scientific articles now </v>

1926
01:47:21.740 --> 01:47:25.560
<v Speaker 1>been published saying that showing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Turkey tail mushroom constituents help </v>

1927
01:47:25.560 --> 01:47:27.990
<v Speaker 1>conventional therapies like </v>
<v Speaker 1>chemotherapy,</v>

1928
01:47:27.991 --> 01:47:30.360
<v Speaker 1>the herceptin and making herceptin work </v>
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>

1929
01:47:30.810 --> 01:47:35.810
<v Speaker 1>So there's a nice blending of </v>
<v Speaker 1>integrative medicine with using natural </v>

1930
01:47:35.810 --> 01:47:40.401
<v Speaker 1>products with conventional medicine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will never be say that you should not </v>

1931
01:47:41.340 --> 01:47:42.330
<v Speaker 1>consult a physician.</v>

1932
01:47:42.330 --> 01:47:44.610
<v Speaker 1>I will never say that you should not use</v>
<v Speaker 1>conventional medicine.</v>

1933
01:47:44.820 --> 01:47:48.960
<v Speaker 1>You should is the state of the art of </v>
<v Speaker 1>science is right there,</v>

1934
01:47:49.200 --> 01:47:54.200
<v Speaker 1>but the state of the arts and sciences </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we can upregulate immunity with </v>

1935
01:47:54.200 --> 01:47:57.831
<v Speaker 1>these mushrooms and that's your front </v>
<v Speaker 1>line of defense and then the other </v>

1936
01:47:57.831 --> 01:48:00.990
<v Speaker 1>conventional therapies that are being </v>
<v Speaker 1>practiced now combine very,</v>

1937
01:48:00.991 --> 01:48:05.610
<v Speaker 1>very nicely according to many physicians</v>
<v Speaker 1>and reports showing that the combination</v>

1938
01:48:05.630 --> 01:48:10.630
<v Speaker 1>of Turkey tail mushrooms in combination </v>
<v Speaker 1>with conventional therapy can have a </v>

1939
01:48:11.371 --> 01:48:15.360
<v Speaker 1>significant difference in improving your</v>
<v Speaker 1>immunological defense.</v>

1940
01:48:15.770 --> 01:48:20.770
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I absolutely agree with you that </v>

1941
01:48:20.770 --> 01:48:23.240
<v Speaker 1>conventional treatments are state of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>art and this is state of the art </v>

1942
01:48:23.240 --> 01:48:27.411
<v Speaker 1>science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you're talking about dealing with </v>

1943
01:48:27.411 --> 01:48:29.331
<v Speaker 1>cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should deal with oncologists that </v>

1944
01:48:29.331 --> 01:48:30.720
<v Speaker 1>are at the cutting edge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're not state of the art when it</v>

1945
01:48:30.721 --> 01:48:35.070
<v Speaker 1>comes to the preventing of these things </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that that's a giant issue that a lot</v>

1946
01:48:35.071 --> 01:48:37.110
<v Speaker 1>of people have when it comes to </v>
<v Speaker 1>nutrition,</v>

1947
01:48:37.350 --> 01:48:40.500
<v Speaker 1>lifestyle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mitigating stress,</v>

1948
01:48:40.501 --> 01:48:44.700
<v Speaker 1>all the various factors that contribute </v>
<v Speaker 1>to a bunch of different health ailments.</v>

1949
01:48:45.060 --> 01:48:50.060
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that mushrooms could also </v>
<v Speaker 1>play a factor in that as well?</v>

1950
01:48:50.460 --> 01:48:52.650
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

1951
01:48:52.950 --> 01:48:57.330
<v Speaker 1>There's a great epidemiological study </v>
<v Speaker 1>that came out of Japan and dr.</v>

1952
01:48:57.770 --> 01:49:02.770
<v Speaker 1>Valois was a epidemiologist that worked </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the national cancer center in tokyo </v>

1953
01:49:03.900 --> 01:49:08.900
<v Speaker 1>and they noticed and surveying people in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Japan in the 19 sixties,</v>

1954
01:49:09.360 --> 01:49:12.030
<v Speaker 1>early 19 seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a dearth,</v>

1955
01:49:12.120 --> 01:49:16.830
<v Speaker 1>a drop in the overall cancer rate and </v>
<v Speaker 1>this one population in nagano prefecture</v>

1956
01:49:17.100 --> 01:49:22.100
<v Speaker 1>in Japan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he was sent there by the national </v>

1957
01:49:22.100 --> 01:49:24.981
<v Speaker 1>cancer center of tokyo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the government to say what are these </v>

1958
01:49:24.981 --> 01:49:28.101
<v Speaker 1>people doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this one cluster of villages where </v>

1959
01:49:28.101 --> 01:49:28.740
<v Speaker 1>they have statistically significant less</v>
<v Speaker 1>cancer rates.</v>

1960
01:49:28.741 --> 01:49:31.260
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about 30 percent less than</v>
<v Speaker 1>the national average.</v>

1961
01:49:31.640 --> 01:49:35.610
<v Speaker 1>And after exhaustive study he found that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were eating enoki mushrooms.</v>

1962
01:49:35.790 --> 01:49:40.790
<v Speaker 1>A lot of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the enoki mushrooms are really </v>

1963
01:49:40.790 --> 01:49:40.790
<v Speaker 1>thin ones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like really tall stems.</v>

1964
01:49:40.790 --> 01:49:41.280
<v Speaker 1>You can buy them in the store.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1965
01:49:41.340 --> 01:49:46.340
<v Speaker 1>the font,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a big farming centers for </v>

1966
01:49:46.340 --> 01:49:47.070
<v Speaker 1>enoki mushrooms there and then the </v>
<v Speaker 1>blemished ones as us.</v>

1967
01:49:47.410 --> 01:49:48.100
<v Speaker 1>Roberta,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no.</v>

1968
01:49:48.110 --> 01:49:53.110
<v Speaker 1>We don't sell to the public,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ones that have little spots on them </v>

1969
01:49:53.110 --> 01:49:53.920
<v Speaker 1>or are deformed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they are given to the workers and so</v>

1970
01:49:53.921 --> 01:49:58.921
<v Speaker 1>their workers and then their families </v>
<v Speaker 1>eat a higher per capita consumption of </v>

1971
01:49:58.921 --> 01:50:00.640
<v Speaker 1>enoki mushrooms than the other residents</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Japan.</v>

1972
01:50:01.030 --> 01:50:06.030
<v Speaker 1>So they found that specifically the </v>
<v Speaker 1>consumption of enoki mushrooms resulted </v>

1973
01:50:07.270 --> 01:50:11.380
<v Speaker 1>in a reduction of cancer across the </v>
<v Speaker 1>board of all cancers.</v>

1974
01:50:11.381 --> 01:50:14.440
<v Speaker 1>Statistically significant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think over 220,000</v>

1975
01:50:14.441 --> 01:50:19.441
<v Speaker 1>people in this epidemiological survey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've written about 10 articles for the </v>

1976
01:50:19.441 --> 01:50:21.220
<v Speaker 1>huffington post and you can google </v>
<v Speaker 1>stamets,</v>

1977
01:50:21.221 --> 01:50:25.060
<v Speaker 1>huffington post and enoki mushrooms and </v>
<v Speaker 1>see all the citations on enoki mushrooms</v>

1978
01:50:25.240 --> 01:50:29.950
<v Speaker 1>on lion's mane on [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>All these mushrooms I'm talking about,</v>

1979
01:50:30.490 --> 01:50:32.770
<v Speaker 1>they're all peer reviewed past </v>
<v Speaker 1>physicians.</v>

1980
01:50:32.771 --> 01:50:36.280
<v Speaker 1>They're all very short articles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they summarize a lot of the research</v>

1981
01:50:36.281 --> 01:50:37.030
<v Speaker 1>that I'm talking about.</v>

1982
01:50:37.470 --> 01:50:38.930
<v Speaker 2>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1983
01:50:38.970 --> 01:50:43.970
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you know about the quarter eps </v>

1984
01:50:43.970 --> 01:50:43.970
<v Speaker 2>mushroom?</v>

1985
01:50:43.970 --> 01:50:44.560
<v Speaker 1>I know a fair amount about cortisol.</v>

1986
01:50:44.820 --> 01:50:47.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm fascinated for two reasons.</v>

1987
01:50:47.791 --> 01:50:51.120
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of a supplement that I take that</v>

1988
01:50:51.121 --> 01:50:54.210
<v Speaker 2>my company makes called true tech sport,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorry for the name.</v>

1989
01:50:54.780 --> 01:50:59.340
<v Speaker 2>My apologies in advance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>buT it's based on athletic performance,</v>

1990
01:50:59.341 --> 01:51:04.341
<v Speaker 2>but the shroom tech is based on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>quarter steps and be 12 and a bunch of </v>

1991
01:51:04.741 --> 01:51:09.741
<v Speaker 2>different adaptogens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the idea being that when you take </v>

1992
01:51:09.741 --> 01:51:10.200
<v Speaker 2>that it benefits athletic performance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>benefits,</v>

1993
01:51:10.560 --> 01:51:14.970
<v Speaker 2>endurance and oxygen utilization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And apparently they discoVered this from</v>

1994
01:51:15.200 --> 01:51:20.200
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a weird one because they grow it </v>

1995
01:51:20.200 --> 01:51:20.200
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on a caterpillar,</v>

1996
01:51:20.330 --> 01:51:21.510
<v Speaker 2>d,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you know about all that?</v>

1997
01:51:21.570 --> 01:51:26.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cordyceps is now has been split into </v>

1998
01:51:26.570 --> 01:51:26.570
<v Speaker 1>several different gentlemen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1999
01:51:26.790 --> 01:51:31.790
<v Speaker 2>bring up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other one is the one that explodes </v>

2000
01:51:31.790 --> 01:51:31.790
<v Speaker 2>on ants.</v>

2001
01:51:31.790 --> 01:51:31.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a.</v>

2002
01:51:31.790 --> 01:51:36.540
<v Speaker 1>There's a quarter steps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sinensis now known as [inaudible] </v>

2003
01:51:36.910 --> 01:51:40.870
<v Speaker 1>sinensis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>cordyceps has about 500 species in it.</v>

2004
01:51:41.410 --> 01:51:45.550
<v Speaker 1>It's been a very complicated taxonomy </v>
<v Speaker 1>because when researchers would go in the</v>

2005
01:51:45.551 --> 01:51:50.551
<v Speaker 1>himalayas and they find these </v>
<v Speaker 1>caterpillars for the quarter system </v>

2006
01:51:50.551 --> 01:51:52.510
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms coming out of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very good scientists,</v>

2007
01:51:53.470 --> 01:51:54.850
<v Speaker 1>and they did this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I would do,</v>

2008
01:51:54.851 --> 01:51:59.851
<v Speaker 1>they would take it in a laboratory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would break it open and take a </v>

2009
01:51:59.851 --> 01:51:59.851
<v Speaker 1>piece of tissue from the inside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They.</v>

2010
01:51:59.851 --> 01:52:04.051
<v Speaker 1>It's called cloning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you just capture their genetic </v>

2011
01:52:04.051 --> 01:52:04.051
<v Speaker 1>material.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You grow out the culture.</v>

2012
01:52:04.090 --> 01:52:07.210
<v Speaker 1>Very confusing because there's five </v>
<v Speaker 1>different fungi.</v>

2013
01:52:07.240 --> 01:52:11.050
<v Speaker 1>They're called anna morphs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cordyceps is a dimorphic fungus.</v>

2014
01:52:11.051 --> 01:52:16.051
<v Speaker 1>what that means as two forms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's got a mold state and it's got a </v>

2015
01:52:16.051 --> 01:52:19.801
<v Speaker 1>mushroom state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The mushroom state comes up like a </v>

2016
01:52:19.801 --> 01:52:19.801
<v Speaker 1>little club,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looked like your finger would go,</v>

2017
01:52:19.801 --> 01:52:19.900
<v Speaker 1>orange,</v>
<v Speaker 1>orange,</v>

2018
01:52:19.901 --> 01:52:24.901
<v Speaker 1>little finger coming up out of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ground so you can find that jamie and </v>

2019
01:52:24.901 --> 01:52:24.901
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>

2020
01:52:25.010 --> 01:52:27.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so is this a expired caterpillar?</v>

2021
01:52:28.830 --> 01:52:32.080
<v Speaker 1>I can't actually see the species there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it looked like they're beetles,</v>

2022
01:52:34.210 --> 01:52:36.000
<v Speaker 1>so there's a number of core set of </v>
<v Speaker 1>species.</v>

2023
01:52:36.920 --> 01:52:41.920
<v Speaker 1>So when there was a lot of scientific </v>
<v Speaker 1>dispute on what the true anamorphic,</v>

2024
01:52:43.030 --> 01:52:48.030
<v Speaker 1>now it's two sides of the same coin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see the quarter and then you clone </v>

2025
01:52:48.030 --> 01:52:51.620
<v Speaker 1>it and you get this mold growing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then people will grow up the mold.</v>

2026
01:52:52.220 --> 01:52:56.480
<v Speaker 1>Well now we know there are several </v>
<v Speaker 1>species of molds that are growing inside</v>

2027
01:52:56.481 --> 01:53:01.481
<v Speaker 1>the caterpillar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the true cost us a quarter step </v>

2028
01:53:01.481 --> 01:53:04.340
<v Speaker 1>sinensis is now identified as her tele </v>
<v Speaker 1>condensed sinensis.</v>

2029
01:53:04.760 --> 01:53:09.760
<v Speaker 1>That's the true one facility on my cs </v>
<v Speaker 1>and monetarism and all these other ones </v>

2030
01:53:09.760 --> 01:53:12.500
<v Speaker 1>are not considered to be the true </v>
<v Speaker 1>organism.</v>

2031
01:53:12.980 --> 01:53:17.980
<v Speaker 1>They're chasing the other quarters steps</v>
<v Speaker 1>mold inside of the mushroom.</v>

2032
01:53:18.360 --> 01:53:19.230
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2033
01:53:21.640 --> 01:53:26.640
<v Speaker 1>I can't keep up with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This isn't going to be one that I'm </v>

2034
01:53:26.640 --> 01:53:26.640
<v Speaker 1>going to go over many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>

2035
01:53:26.640 --> 01:53:28.070
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many poly culture,</v>

2036
01:53:28.390 --> 01:53:32.000
<v Speaker 1>poly call polyculture with several </v>
<v Speaker 1>different entimopathogenic fungi.</v>

2037
01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:35.220
<v Speaker 1>These are fungi that kill insects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I mean this is very,</v>

2038
01:53:35.630 --> 01:53:40.630
<v Speaker 1>very disruptive because all of the fda </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the labeling and how do you label </v>

2039
01:53:40.630 --> 01:53:44.411
<v Speaker 1>this or what do you do and who's right </v>
<v Speaker 1>and who's wrong and how do you get the </v>

2040
01:53:44.411 --> 01:53:46.730
<v Speaker 1>labeling to conform with the current </v>
<v Speaker 1>taxonomy based on dna research.</v>

2041
01:53:47.390 --> 01:53:50.960
<v Speaker 1>The good news is based on the best of my</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge,</v>

2042
01:53:51.300 --> 01:53:55.130
<v Speaker 1>the several of these companies that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>selling these quarter steps,</v>

2043
01:53:55.131 --> 01:53:58.580
<v Speaker 1>they anam wharfs even though they may </v>
<v Speaker 1>not be the true cordyceps sinensis.</v>

2044
01:53:58.820 --> 01:54:03.820
<v Speaker 1>Those also confer benefits so you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>argue in a sense about different </v>

2045
01:54:05.481 --> 01:54:08.150
<v Speaker 1>species.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem with this is there's no less</v>

2046
01:54:08.151 --> 01:54:11.460
<v Speaker 1>than a thousand peer reviewed articles </v>
<v Speaker 1>on quarter acep,</v>

2047
01:54:11.461 --> 01:54:16.461
<v Speaker 1>sinensis and no one or hardly anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one knows what species they were </v>

2048
01:54:17.091 --> 01:54:19.220
<v Speaker 1>actually growing because if we don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>know which,</v>

2049
01:54:19.250 --> 01:54:24.250
<v Speaker 1>which of these animal wars there were </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually growing was this recent </v>

2050
01:54:24.250 --> 01:54:24.250
<v Speaker 1>information is all very recent.</v>

2051
01:54:24.250 --> 01:54:27.080
<v Speaker 1>All in the past four or five years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and especially in the past two years,</v>

2052
01:54:27.081 --> 01:54:32.081
<v Speaker 1>so it's taxonomy is in flux because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dna pcr amplification in the region of </v>

2053
01:54:34.791 --> 01:54:39.110
<v Speaker 1>dna that they've chosen to amplify there</v>
<v Speaker 1>are idiosyncratic to the species.</v>

2054
01:54:39.350 --> 01:54:44.350
<v Speaker 1>Now that story has changed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whole genome sequencing is really the </v>

2055
01:54:44.350 --> 01:54:47.741
<v Speaker 1>only way to go about this where they </v>
<v Speaker 1>sequence the entire genome and so there </v>

2056
01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:53.000
<v Speaker 1>was a lot of elasticity or plasticity in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the expression of dna.</v>

2057
01:54:54.080 --> 01:54:55.820
<v Speaker 1>Now going back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we've been talking about,</v>

2058
01:54:55.821 --> 01:54:58.310
<v Speaker 1>this whole interview,</v>
<v Speaker 1>epa,</v>

2059
01:54:58.311 --> 01:54:59.570
<v Speaker 1>genesis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>epa,</v>

2060
01:54:59.571 --> 01:55:04.571
<v Speaker 1>genesis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the an environmental stimulus has a </v>

2061
01:55:04.571 --> 01:55:08.471
<v Speaker 1>selective influence on the genomic </v>
<v Speaker 1>expression of the individual species </v>

2062
01:55:08.781 --> 01:55:13.781
<v Speaker 1>yourself and so you up regulate or turn </v>
<v Speaker 1>on genes that are otherwise quote </v>

2063
01:55:13.781 --> 01:55:18.701
<v Speaker 1>unquote asleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what we're seeing now is that </v>

2064
01:55:18.701 --> 01:55:23.680
<v Speaker 1>epigenetic influences can cause </v>
<v Speaker 1>different dna expressions and so what </v>

2065
01:55:26.001 --> 01:55:31.001
<v Speaker 1>was considered to be conformity of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>species in dna types before like 99 </v>

2066
01:55:31.001 --> 01:55:31.070
<v Speaker 1>percent.</v>

2067
01:55:31.070 --> 01:55:31.910
<v Speaker 1>And that was thought that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2068
01:55:31.911 --> 01:55:34.820
<v Speaker 1>we're the same species.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we know that's highly inaccurate.</v>

2069
01:55:35.120 --> 01:55:40.120
<v Speaker 1>So what was accurate a few years ago is </v>
<v Speaker 1>considered to be highly inaccurate </v>

2070
01:55:40.120 --> 01:55:41.900
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The science is changing very,</v>

2071
01:55:41.901 --> 01:55:44.550
<v Speaker 1>very rapidly and the regulatory </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment cannot catch up,</v>

2072
01:55:45.030 --> 01:55:49.020
<v Speaker 1>so it doesn't really matter except for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the following,</v>

2073
01:55:49.050 --> 01:55:51.210
<v Speaker 1>and this is I do make a recommendation </v>
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

2074
01:55:51.750 --> 01:55:56.750
<v Speaker 1>make sure your mushrooms or whatever </v>
<v Speaker 1>products you're consuming are certified </v>

2075
01:55:56.750 --> 01:55:58.590
<v Speaker 1>organic and please don't buy them from </v>
<v Speaker 1>China.</v>

2076
01:55:59.940 --> 01:56:02.610
<v Speaker 1>Anyone who's been to China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been to China several times.</v>

2077
01:56:02.611 --> 01:56:07.611
<v Speaker 1>The amount of massive air pollution </v>
<v Speaker 1>there is horrific and the chain of </v>

2078
01:56:07.611 --> 01:56:09.180
<v Speaker 1>custody as we call it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where are these people are getting their</v>

2079
01:56:09.181 --> 01:56:11.670
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms because they had mixed </v>
<v Speaker 1>oftentimes distributors,</v>

2080
01:56:11.671 --> 01:56:15.000
<v Speaker 1>mixed suppliers and as a form of quote </v>
<v Speaker 1>unquote russian roulette.</v>

2081
01:56:15.360 --> 01:56:20.360
<v Speaker 1>We've done analyses on chinese sourced </v>
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms and they've had up to 2100 </v>

2082
01:56:20.360 --> 01:56:23.670
<v Speaker 1>parts per million of lead where two or </v>
<v Speaker 1>three capsules is toxic.</v>

2083
01:56:23.970 --> 01:56:28.970
<v Speaker 1>So why would you take a medicinal </v>
<v Speaker 1>mushroom that's contaminated with heavy </v>

2084
01:56:28.970 --> 01:56:31.821
<v Speaker 1>metals and pesticides?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're trying to improve your immune </v>

2085
01:56:31.821 --> 01:56:31.920
<v Speaker 1>system at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're sabotaging your immune system,</v>

2086
01:56:32.310 --> 01:56:36.240
<v Speaker 1>so getting mushrooms from clean </v>
<v Speaker 1>environments is critically important.</v>

2087
01:56:36.480 --> 01:56:41.480
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the usda organic program they </v>

2088
01:56:41.480 --> 01:56:45.111
<v Speaker 1>can borrow from the organic programs of </v>
<v Speaker 1>China is still say they're certified </v>

2089
01:56:45.111 --> 01:56:49.461
<v Speaker 1>organic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you really need to buy us grown </v>

2090
01:56:49.461 --> 01:56:52.440
<v Speaker 1>certified organic mushrooms that have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>clear chain of custody and hopefully one</v>

2091
01:56:52.441 --> 01:56:57.441
<v Speaker 1>that is from a reputable supplier or </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientist and not somebody who's just </v>

2092
01:56:57.441 --> 01:56:58.440
<v Speaker 1>trying to make money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of opportunistic companies</v>

2093
01:56:58.441 --> 01:57:02.280
<v Speaker 1>right now who are just trying to exploit</v>
<v Speaker 1>and ride the bandwagon of the popularity</v>

2094
01:57:02.281 --> 01:57:07.281
<v Speaker 1>of medicinal mushrooms without really </v>
<v Speaker 1>having done their homework or without </v>

2095
01:57:07.281 --> 01:57:10.980
<v Speaker 1>fully informing the public that their </v>
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms are actually coming from China</v>

2096
01:57:10.981 --> 01:57:14.700
<v Speaker 1>when they are not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the strain of cordyceps mushroom</v>

2097
01:57:14.701 --> 01:57:18.240
<v Speaker 1>that erupts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that infects ants,</v>

2098
01:57:18.360 --> 01:57:20.220
<v Speaker 1>kills them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sprouts out of them,</v>

2099
01:57:20.221 --> 01:57:25.221
<v Speaker 1>and then explodes and infects the ants </v>
<v Speaker 1>near them and other ants will drag that </v>

2100
01:57:25.221 --> 01:57:28.380
<v Speaker 1>ant knowing that it's infected deep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deep away into the forest,</v>

2101
01:57:28.830 --> 01:57:30.260
<v Speaker 1>away from the column just quarter.</v>

2102
01:57:30.380 --> 01:57:33.110
<v Speaker 1>Lord dei up on the screen there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pulled up.</v>

2103
01:57:33.270 --> 01:57:38.270
<v Speaker 1>We of course step laurie dei,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you lateralis is another one of these </v>

2104
01:57:38.281 --> 01:57:41.670
<v Speaker 1>zombie movies he'd been saying have been</v>
<v Speaker 1>based on cordyceps and next.</v>

2105
01:57:41.671 --> 01:57:46.560
<v Speaker 1>I was actUally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was a character in hannibal lecter.</v>

2106
01:57:46.890 --> 01:57:47.720
<v Speaker 1>You were?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2107
01:57:47.730 --> 01:57:52.730
<v Speaker 1>in the series.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's number five and and l I </v>

2108
01:57:52.801 --> 01:57:57.570
<v Speaker 1>think elvin stamets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was this anesthesiologist gave your last</v>

2109
01:57:57.571 --> 01:57:58.220
<v Speaker 1>name?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2110
01:57:58.240 --> 01:58:00.210
<v Speaker 1>use my last name and they just call you </v>
<v Speaker 1>paul.</v>

2111
01:58:00.510 --> 01:58:03.170
<v Speaker 1>Well they do on star trek.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a character instructor.</v>

2112
01:58:03.760 --> 01:58:05.580
<v Speaker 1>They actually call me paul stamets on </v>
<v Speaker 1>star trek,</v>

2113
01:58:07.590 --> 01:58:10.920
<v Speaker 1>but hannibal lecter that series.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I let people write me,</v>

2114
01:58:10.921 --> 01:58:11.460
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my gosh,</v>

2115
01:58:11.461 --> 01:58:16.461
<v Speaker 1>you're this evil doctor who overdoses </v>
<v Speaker 1>his patients with drugs and then puts </v>

2116
01:58:17.911 --> 01:58:22.911
<v Speaker 1>them in the backyard and then inoculates</v>
<v Speaker 1>with mushrooms just like cordyceps </v>

2117
01:58:22.911 --> 01:58:27.650
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms growing in the backyard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And some of the star trek people called </v>

2118
01:58:27.650 --> 01:58:27.900
<v Speaker 1>me up in august of 2016.</v>

2119
01:58:28.740 --> 01:58:31.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They cbs set it up.</v>

2120
01:58:31.221 --> 01:58:33.100
<v Speaker 1>They have to talk to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They saw my ted talk and,</v>

2121
01:58:33.720 --> 01:58:34.980
<v Speaker 1>and they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>paul,</v>

2122
01:58:34.981 --> 01:58:37.350
<v Speaker 1>we're the writers of the star trek </v>
<v Speaker 1>discovery series.</v>

2123
01:58:37.351 --> 01:58:38.730
<v Speaker 1>We're kind of stuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2124
01:58:39.070 --> 01:58:41.770
<v Speaker 1>we want to talk to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We saw your ted talk really interested.</v>

2125
01:58:41.771 --> 01:58:42.460
<v Speaker 1>And I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a second,</v>

2126
01:58:42.461 --> 01:58:44.170
<v Speaker 1>are you the one who put me in hannibal </v>
<v Speaker 1>lecter?</v>

2127
01:58:44.171 --> 01:58:44.770
<v Speaker 1>It goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2128
01:58:44.771 --> 01:58:45.210
<v Speaker 1>And I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2129
01:58:45.540 --> 01:58:47.710
<v Speaker 1>let's get it right this time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

2130
01:58:48.670 --> 01:58:49.600
<v Speaker 1>so I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

2131
01:58:49.601 --> 01:58:50.800
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>foolishly,</v>

2132
01:58:51.390 --> 01:58:53.440
<v Speaker 1>or maybe to my benefit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>foolishly,</v>

2133
01:58:53.441 --> 01:58:55.330
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>turn on your tape recorder,</v>

2134
01:58:56.280 --> 01:58:58.990
<v Speaker 1>give me the general idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me run with it.</v>

2135
01:58:59.260 --> 01:59:00.010
<v Speaker 1>And they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2136
01:59:00.160 --> 01:59:05.160
<v Speaker 1>go for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's six of them I guess in the </v>

2137
01:59:05.160 --> 01:59:05.160
<v Speaker 1>conference call.</v>
<v Speaker 1>foolishly,</v>

2138
01:59:05.160 --> 01:59:05.590
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a star trek fan,</v>

2139
01:59:05.591 --> 01:59:08.890
<v Speaker 1>which is not foolish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I want no money for these ideas.</v>

2140
01:59:08.890 --> 01:59:13.890
<v Speaker 1>I give you all my intellectual property.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want science fiction to predict </v>

2141
01:59:13.890 --> 01:59:13.890
<v Speaker 1>science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fact,</v>

2142
01:59:13.890 --> 01:59:18.450
<v Speaker 1>the great thing about star trek is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>flip phone and the ipad came out and </v>

2143
01:59:18.450 --> 01:59:20.320
<v Speaker 1>start truck and then it became reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

2144
01:59:20.321 --> 01:59:23.740
<v Speaker 1>so you have a unique opportunity here of</v>
<v Speaker 1>forming our future.</v>

2145
01:59:24.280 --> 01:59:29.280
<v Speaker 1>Let's collaborate to create a future </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's better for our future </v>

2146
01:59:29.280 --> 01:59:32.941
<v Speaker 1>generations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by inspiring students and young people </v>

2147
01:59:32.941 --> 01:59:37.350
<v Speaker 1>to get excited about the science so they</v>
<v Speaker 1>can help populate the universities to </v>

2148
01:59:37.350 --> 01:59:40.000
<v Speaker 1>create the inventions that can help save</v>
<v Speaker 1>this planet.</v>

2149
01:59:40.300 --> 01:59:45.300
<v Speaker 1>That's in jeopardy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I ran with the star trek theme </v>

2150
01:59:45.300 --> 01:59:49.470
<v Speaker 1>and we just saw the last episode last </v>
<v Speaker 1>night and astrobiologist paul stamets is</v>

2151
01:59:51.040 --> 01:59:53.410
<v Speaker 1>using the mycelium spore drive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is become,</v>

2152
01:59:53.770 --> 01:59:56.800
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're watching this thing and star trek,</v>

2153
01:59:56.801 --> 02:00:01.801
<v Speaker 1>the main theme of star trek is based on </v>
<v Speaker 1>mycelium and the concepts that I gave </v>

2154
02:00:01.801 --> 02:00:01.801
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

2155
02:00:01.801 --> 02:00:03.850
<v Speaker 1>They've elaborated this six ways to </v>
<v Speaker 1>sunday,</v>

2156
02:00:03.851 --> 02:00:07.000
<v Speaker 1>so they've really taken it misses as </v>
<v Speaker 1>some sort of a propulsion system.</v>

2157
02:00:07.350 --> 02:00:10.480
<v Speaker 1>It's a system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because in my ted talk,</v>

2158
02:00:10.481 --> 02:00:12.520
<v Speaker 1>and I've been talking about this a long </v>
<v Speaker 1>time about networks,</v>

2159
02:00:12.790 --> 02:00:15.550
<v Speaker 1>we have the mycelial network,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have the computer internet,</v>

2160
02:00:15.700 --> 02:00:17.860
<v Speaker 1>we have the neurological network in our </v>
<v Speaker 1>brains.</v>

2161
02:00:18.130 --> 02:00:21.370
<v Speaker 1>And the ordination of dark matter </v>
<v Speaker 1>conforms to string theory.</v>

2162
02:00:21.580 --> 02:00:26.050
<v Speaker 1>So these are three archetypes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same archetype,</v>

2163
02:00:26.380 --> 02:00:31.380
<v Speaker 1>the same dimensional structures stacked </v>
<v Speaker 1>on top of each other and nature builds </v>

2164
02:00:31.380 --> 02:00:35.881
<v Speaker 1>upon its prior successes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So networks reward themselves by </v>

2165
02:00:36.581 --> 02:00:38.950
<v Speaker 1>surviving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was from catastrophic.</v>

2166
02:00:39.590 --> 02:00:43.150
<v Speaker 1>So I said I'm still bound by </v>
<v Speaker 1>confidentiality.</v>

2167
02:00:43.151 --> 02:00:45.520
<v Speaker 1>And there's an incredibly strict </v>
<v Speaker 1>confidentiality agreement.</v>

2168
02:00:45.820 --> 02:00:48.280
<v Speaker 1>I can only state which has been publicly</v>
<v Speaker 1>displayed,</v>

2169
02:00:48.640 --> 02:00:53.640
<v Speaker 1>but the mycelium spore allows through </v>
<v Speaker 1>the internet of nature,</v>

2170
02:00:54.371 --> 02:00:59.371
<v Speaker 1>you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be able to go into hyperspace </v>

2171
02:00:59.371 --> 02:01:01.090
<v Speaker 1>immediately by tapping into the mycelial</v>
<v Speaker 1>archetype.</v>

2172
02:01:01.550 --> 02:01:06.550
<v Speaker 1>And so astro mycologist stamets now is </v>
<v Speaker 1>plugging himself into the mycelial </v>

2173
02:01:06.550 --> 02:01:10.981
<v Speaker 1>network of the universe and they can </v>
<v Speaker 1>jump rather than using their standard </v>

2174
02:01:11.921 --> 02:01:16.921
<v Speaker 1>hyper drives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you see them streaming across for </v>

2175
02:01:16.921 --> 02:01:16.921
<v Speaker 1>hours from one part of the university,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other,</v>

2176
02:01:16.921 --> 02:01:19.210
<v Speaker 1>they can show up immediately and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>then disappear.</v>

2177
02:01:19.360 --> 02:01:21.610
<v Speaker 1>Is this something that you think could </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually be real?</v>

2178
02:01:21.611 --> 02:01:23.130
<v Speaker 1>One day?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am.</v>

2179
02:01:23.230 --> 02:01:23.800
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're gonna.</v>

2180
02:01:23.890 --> 02:01:27.280
<v Speaker 1>We're pushing the envelope,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pushing the envelope on this one,</v>

2181
02:01:27.760 --> 02:01:32.110
<v Speaker 1>but if you look at the multiverse and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had a.</v>

2182
02:01:32.170 --> 02:01:37.170
<v Speaker 1>I've had a one or two in particular </v>
<v Speaker 1>multiverse experiences where time and </v>

2183
02:01:40.101 --> 02:01:45.101
<v Speaker 1>reality has changed in a way that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>cannot explain it.</v>

2184
02:01:45.201 --> 02:01:50.201
<v Speaker 1>So what do you mean it's so incredibly </v>
<v Speaker 1>profound that I still cannot wrap my </v>

2185
02:01:50.631 --> 02:01:52.050
<v Speaker 1>mind around it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

2186
02:01:52.220 --> 02:01:54.720
<v Speaker 1>these are psilocybin experiences </v>
<v Speaker 1>psilocybin experienced.</v>

2187
02:01:54.721 --> 02:01:59.721
<v Speaker 1>So I think the psilocybin experience </v>
<v Speaker 1>might be a one will portal.</v>

2188
02:01:59.960 --> 02:02:04.960
<v Speaker 1>And now I'm going to sound like terence </v>
<v Speaker 1>mckenna vendoring in the to the </v>

2189
02:02:04.960 --> 02:02:08.480
<v Speaker 1>multiverse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea that time can be bent,</v>

2190
02:02:09.230 --> 02:02:14.230
<v Speaker 1>that there are multiple universes </v>
<v Speaker 1>occurring simultaneously in different </v>

2191
02:02:14.230 --> 02:02:17.891
<v Speaker 1>realities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've had one experience in </v>

2192
02:02:17.891 --> 02:02:17.930
<v Speaker 1>particular that is just unfathomable to </v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

2193
02:02:19.220 --> 02:02:24.220
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how to explain it is okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll give it a shot.</v>

2194
02:02:25.490 --> 02:02:29.090
<v Speaker 1>You've already blown my mind this 50 </v>
<v Speaker 1>times today.</v>

2195
02:02:29.240 --> 02:02:31.730
<v Speaker 1>This is a very deeply personal </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience to me,</v>

2196
02:02:31.731 --> 02:02:36.731
<v Speaker 1>but I was um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was going to the evergreen state </v>

2197
02:02:36.731 --> 02:02:41.441
<v Speaker 1>college.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had the drug enforcement </v>

2198
02:02:41.441 --> 02:02:42.770
<v Speaker 1>administration license.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My brother john went to yale university.</v>

2199
02:02:43.940 --> 02:02:48.940
<v Speaker 1>He got a graduate scholarship in </v>
<v Speaker 1>neurophysiology at the university of </v>

2200
02:02:48.940 --> 02:02:52.421
<v Speaker 1>Washington.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He came out to Washington state and </v>

2201
02:02:52.421 --> 02:02:52.421
<v Speaker 1>seattle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was living in olympia,</v>

2202
02:02:52.421 --> 02:02:56.441
<v Speaker 1>Washington.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a cabin up in the mountains near </v>

2203
02:02:56.441 --> 02:03:01.241
<v Speaker 1>darrington,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Washington of the summertime for three </v>

2204
02:03:01.241 --> 02:03:01.241
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I set chokers.</v>

2205
02:03:01.241 --> 02:03:01.670
<v Speaker 1>I was a logger.</v>

2206
02:03:02.120 --> 02:03:05.960
<v Speaker 1>I really believe in the school of hard </v>
<v Speaker 1>knocks and the blending of academia with</v>

2207
02:03:06.260 --> 02:03:07.310
<v Speaker 1>blue collar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hard work.</v>

2208
02:03:07.700 --> 02:03:10.010
<v Speaker 1>I love chopping wood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love running a chainsaw.</v>

2209
02:03:10.100 --> 02:03:14.900
<v Speaker 1>I love hard labor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it gives my mind some respite to</v>

2210
02:03:14.901 --> 02:03:19.901
<v Speaker 1>be able to think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm in this highly academic </v>

2211
02:03:19.901 --> 02:03:20.000
<v Speaker 1>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My brother john,</v>

2212
02:03:20.600 --> 02:03:23.230
<v Speaker 1>he died unfortunately two years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>soon.</v>

2213
02:03:23.440 --> 02:03:28.440
<v Speaker 1>See he got me involved in mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm going to segue and set the stage </v>

2214
02:03:28.440 --> 02:03:32.831
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I needed another two minutes to set </v>

2215
02:03:32.831 --> 02:03:34.571
<v Speaker 1>the stage here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm growing up in a small town in </v>

2216
02:03:34.571 --> 02:03:37.841
<v Speaker 1>Ohio called columbiana.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My brother john goes to is going to </v>

2217
02:03:37.841 --> 02:03:41.021
<v Speaker 1>yale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He comes back one day and it gives me a </v>

2218
02:03:41.021 --> 02:03:43.440
<v Speaker 1>book that he usually for his class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's on break and he said,</v>

2219
02:03:43.441 --> 02:03:45.710
<v Speaker 1>I am really fascinated and john went to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mexico.</v>

2220
02:03:45.711 --> 02:03:50.711
<v Speaker 1>Colombia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>came back with great stories of eating </v>

2221
02:03:50.711 --> 02:03:50.711
<v Speaker 1>psilocybin mushrooms and he's my older </v>
<v Speaker 1>brother.</v>

2222
02:03:50.711 --> 02:03:53.480
<v Speaker 1>I just idolized him and his book called </v>
<v Speaker 1>older states of consciousness.</v>

2223
02:03:54.050 --> 02:03:55.460
<v Speaker 1>And so I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>john,</v>

2224
02:03:55.461 --> 02:03:56.450
<v Speaker 1>can I borrow your book?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

2225
02:03:56.451 --> 02:03:58.280
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

2226
02:03:58.281 --> 02:04:03.281
<v Speaker 1>but paul and you get back from my break </v>
<v Speaker 1>is over and going back to college and </v>

2227
02:04:03.281 --> 02:04:03.800
<v Speaker 1>this is part of our textbook.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I borrowed his book,</v>

2228
02:04:03.801 --> 02:04:07.010
<v Speaker 1>altered states of consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just fascinated reading it about all</v>

2229
02:04:07.011 --> 02:04:08.660
<v Speaker 1>these different ways of expanding your </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>

2230
02:04:09.040 --> 02:04:13.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm 14 years of age and so my best </v>
<v Speaker 1>friend Ryan Snyder says,</v>

2231
02:04:13.370 --> 02:04:14.420
<v Speaker 1>paul,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can I borrow your book?</v>

2232
02:04:15.080 --> 02:04:17.810
<v Speaker 1>We're hanging together all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I go,</v>

2233
02:04:17.811 --> 02:04:18.830
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but my idea back,</v>

2234
02:04:19.350 --> 02:04:22.700
<v Speaker 1>so he borrows my book and he doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>return it a day.</v>

2235
02:04:22.970 --> 02:04:23.990
<v Speaker 1>SeverAl days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pass a week,</v>

2236
02:04:23.991 --> 02:04:25.070
<v Speaker 1>pass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two weeks pass.</v>

2237
02:04:25.071 --> 02:04:30.071
<v Speaker 1>My brother's coming back on break.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said I needed that book ball back.</v>

2238
02:04:30.141 --> 02:04:31.850
<v Speaker 1>Paul and I go to ryan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

2239
02:04:31.851 --> 02:04:32.630
<v Speaker 1>ryan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need my book.</v>

2240
02:04:32.630 --> 02:04:37.630
<v Speaker 1>I need my book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and ryan kept on avoiding the answering </v>

2241
02:04:37.630 --> 02:04:37.630
<v Speaker 1>the subject and to finally give me my </v>
<v Speaker 1>book,</v>

2242
02:04:37.860 --> 02:04:39.390
<v Speaker 1>and ryan goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't give it to you,</v>

2243
02:04:39.391 --> 02:04:40.350
<v Speaker 1>paul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

2244
02:04:40.351 --> 02:04:45.351
<v Speaker 1>why is my dad burned it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see your dad burned my brother's book.</v>

2245
02:04:47.670 --> 02:04:49.620
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wtf?</v>

2246
02:04:49.621 --> 02:04:51.750
<v Speaker 1>I didn't use this phrase back then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

2247
02:04:51.840 --> 02:04:56.840
<v Speaker 1>oh my god,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I have a shout out to ryan snyder's </v>

2248
02:04:56.840 --> 02:04:59.871
<v Speaker 1>father because of that event.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It stimulated my interest in altered </v>

2249
02:05:00.361 --> 02:05:05.361
<v Speaker 1>states of consciousness even more so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that john goes to yale and it goes to </v>

2250
02:05:05.641 --> 02:05:09.210
<v Speaker 1>the university of Washington.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have this dea permit.</v>

2251
02:05:09.270 --> 02:05:12.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm at the evergreen state college.</v>
<v Speaker 1>John calls me up and he says,</v>

2252
02:05:12.511 --> 02:05:17.511
<v Speaker 1>paul,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I found some psilocybin </v>

2253
02:05:17.511 --> 02:05:17.511
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>John said,</v>

2254
02:05:17.511 --> 02:05:21.531
<v Speaker 1>you're really smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've been collecting sloppy cubensis </v>

2255
02:05:21.531 --> 02:05:23.631
<v Speaker 1>in Colombia and Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is much more complicated up </v>

2256
02:05:23.631 --> 02:05:23.631
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

2257
02:05:23.631 --> 02:05:24.300
<v Speaker 1>let me ask you a few questions.</v>

2258
02:05:24.690 --> 02:05:25.050
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2259
02:05:25.051 --> 02:05:26.190
<v Speaker 1>john,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you take a spore print?</v>

2260
02:05:26.230 --> 02:05:26.820
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

2261
02:05:26.960 --> 02:05:28.860
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spores purple,</v>

2262
02:05:28.861 --> 02:05:30.390
<v Speaker 1>brown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he goes,</v>

2263
02:05:30.391 --> 02:05:31.410
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are purple brown.</v>

2264
02:05:31.411 --> 02:05:31.980
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

2265

<v Speaker 1>gelatinous pellicle,</v>

2266
02:05:36.900 --> 02:05:37.620
<v Speaker 1>and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's that?</v>

2267
02:05:37.621 --> 02:05:38.070
<v Speaker 1>And I go,</v>

<v Speaker 1>These are growing on wood chips.</v>

2269
02:05:40.620 --> 02:05:43.140
<v Speaker 1>Break the cap and separate the cap very </v>
<v Speaker 1>slowly.</v>

2270
02:05:43.141 --> 02:05:45.660
<v Speaker 1>Do you see a little skin that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>translucent?</v>

2271
02:05:45.710 --> 02:05:46.740
<v Speaker 1>And he breaks it and goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2272
02:05:46.741 --> 02:05:49.320
<v Speaker 1>I see that skin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The john the growing in wood chips,</v>

2273
02:05:49.321 --> 02:05:50.130
<v Speaker 1>and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

2274
02:05:50.220 --> 02:05:52.590
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are they turning bluish?</v>

2275
02:05:52.860 --> 02:05:53.490
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

2276
02:05:53.491 --> 02:05:56.490
<v Speaker 1>they're staining really bright blue go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>

2277
02:05:56.880 --> 02:05:57.600
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>john,</v>

2278
02:05:57.810 --> 02:06:00.030
<v Speaker 1>how many did you find?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

2279
02:06:00.300 --> 02:06:03.930
<v Speaker 1>you would not believe it is a huge </v>
<v Speaker 1>amount.</v>

2280
02:06:04.230 --> 02:06:05.180
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait.</v>

2281
02:06:05.470 --> 02:06:06.860
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>paul,</v>

2282
02:06:07.100 --> 02:06:09.960
<v Speaker 1>they're in a very sensitive place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You better come up here right away.</v>

2283
02:06:10.380 --> 02:06:13.980
<v Speaker 1>So I jumped in my car and I drove up </v>
<v Speaker 1>from olympia to seattle about 60,</v>

2284
02:06:14.040 --> 02:06:14.730
<v Speaker 1>70 miles.</v>

2285
02:06:15.480 --> 02:06:18.570
<v Speaker 1>I get to his house and john's there and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

2286
02:06:18.571 --> 02:06:19.750
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where are we going to say,</v>

2287
02:06:19.790 --> 02:06:24.790
<v Speaker 1>well we need some grocery bags and let's</v>
<v Speaker 1>get on our bikes and let's go down </v>

2288
02:06:25.411 --> 02:06:26.010
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

2289
02:06:26.370 --> 02:06:30.270
<v Speaker 1>why all the secrecy and the promise is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you'll see.</v>

2290
02:06:30.600 --> 02:06:34.920
<v Speaker 1>And it was the end of boat street and </v>
<v Speaker 1>right at the university of Washington,</v>

2291
02:06:35.040 --> 02:06:39.180
<v Speaker 1>right off of university avenue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's boat street and we get there and</v>

2292
02:06:39.181 --> 02:06:41.490
<v Speaker 1>right across the street as a police </v>
<v Speaker 1>substation.</v>

2293
02:06:42.390 --> 02:06:46.710
<v Speaker 1>So we're there and it was an eruption of</v>
<v Speaker 1>this mushroom that had to be 10,000,</v>

2294
02:06:46.980 --> 02:06:48.000
<v Speaker 1>30,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms,</v>

2295
02:06:48.001 --> 02:06:53.001
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is about 50 feet by 30 feet with all </v>

2296
02:06:53.001 --> 02:06:56.110
<v Speaker 1>been cultured wood chips.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was an eruption that picked up </v>

2297
02:06:56.110 --> 02:06:57.420
<v Speaker 1>trash and debris that picked up six </v>
<v Speaker 1>inches,</v>

2298
02:06:57.421 --> 02:06:59.910
<v Speaker 1>was solid mushrooms there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mushrooms everywhere.</v>

2299
02:07:00.120 --> 02:07:05.120
<v Speaker 1>To this day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>never seen so many mushrooms in one </v>

2300
02:07:05.120 --> 02:07:07.491
<v Speaker 1>concentrated area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we waited until the police cars went </v>

2301
02:07:07.491 --> 02:07:10.461
<v Speaker 1>away and were kind of idling there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the police cars will go away </v>

2302
02:07:10.461 --> 02:07:10.461
<v Speaker 1>and from the substation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we'd start picking mushrooms,</v>

2303
02:07:10.461 --> 02:07:15.201
<v Speaker 1>picking mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we fill up a grocery bag or two and </v>

2304
02:07:15.201 --> 02:07:15.690
<v Speaker 1>then the other students are walking by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing?</v>

2305
02:07:15.691 --> 02:07:16.230
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>

2306
02:07:16.231 --> 02:07:21.231
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we eventually got plenty for </v>

2307
02:07:21.231 --> 02:07:21.231
<v Speaker 1>everybody.</v>

2308
02:07:21.231 --> 02:07:25.780
<v Speaker 1>So it was like pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's all hanging out as a little </v>

2309
02:07:25.780 --> 02:07:25.780
<v Speaker 1>group like at the bus stop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2310
02:07:25.780 --> 02:07:26.800
<v Speaker 1>We're not really waiting for the bus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2311
02:07:26.810 --> 02:07:28.410
<v Speaker 1>We're waiting for the police cars to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>

2312
02:07:28.890 --> 02:07:33.890
<v Speaker 1>And then we picked all these mushrooms </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so we got about eight or 10 grocery </v>

2313
02:07:33.890 --> 02:07:35.500
<v Speaker 1>bags full of these mushrooms help as it </v>
<v Speaker 1>turned out to be a new species of called</v>

2314
02:07:35.501 --> 02:07:37.430
<v Speaker 1>philosophy students.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See I'm named after him.</v>

2315
02:07:37.510 --> 02:07:39.340
<v Speaker 1>No species,</v>
<v Speaker 1>new species,</v>

2316
02:07:40.160 --> 02:07:45.160
<v Speaker 1>as in hadn't been discovered with had </v>
<v Speaker 1>never been described in the scientific </v>

2317
02:07:45.160 --> 02:07:48.961
<v Speaker 1>literature and before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you picked a mushroom that no one </v>

2318
02:07:48.961 --> 02:07:50.560
<v Speaker 1>knew existed but hadn't been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hadn't been described scientifically.</v>

2319
02:07:50.590 --> 02:07:52.450
<v Speaker 1>We had known about it for about three </v>
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>

2320
02:07:52.451 --> 02:07:57.451
<v Speaker 1>but this is a largest eruption.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And from that collection became part of </v>

2321
02:07:57.940 --> 02:08:01.780
<v Speaker 1>the type collection that anchored the </v>
<v Speaker 1>species taxonomically.</v>

2322
02:08:02.050 --> 02:08:07.050
<v Speaker 1>So I think some of the specimens still </v>
<v Speaker 1>exist in her barrier around the world </v>

2323
02:08:07.050 --> 02:08:07.780
<v Speaker 1>because it's the reference standard.</v>

2324
02:08:08.620 --> 02:08:13.060
<v Speaker 1>So we go back to the house and it's like</v>
<v Speaker 1>we gotta dry them,</v>

2325
02:08:14.200 --> 02:08:19.200
<v Speaker 1>so we lay out newspapers and the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole newspapers were just covered </v>

2326
02:08:20.531 --> 02:08:21.800
<v Speaker 1>with mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

2327
02:08:22.540 --> 02:08:25.900
<v Speaker 1>and so that night we just above four </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys from yale,</v>

2328
02:08:25.901 --> 02:08:29.540
<v Speaker 1>all neurophysiology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all scientists on scientist track them,</v>

2329
02:08:30.670 --> 02:08:32.230
<v Speaker 1>eat them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

2330
02:08:32.231 --> 02:08:34.100
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not very potent there.</v>

2331
02:08:34.150 --> 02:08:39.080
<v Speaker 1>One 10th the potency of cubensis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we made smoothies and uh,</v>

2332
02:08:39.081 --> 02:08:42.010
<v Speaker 1>oh my gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about the gag reflex.</v>

2333
02:08:42.011 --> 02:08:47.011
<v Speaker 1>So we had to make these foods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have 50 of them in order to have a </v>

2334
02:08:47.011 --> 02:08:49.520
<v Speaker 1>dose equivalent equivalent to westlaw </v>
<v Speaker 1>speak.</v>

2335
02:08:49.550 --> 02:08:51.190
<v Speaker 1>Vince's would be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I knew that.</v>

2336
02:08:51.191 --> 02:08:56.191
<v Speaker 1>So we made these incredibly distasteful </v>
<v Speaker 1>Milkshakes and we chugged them,</v>

2337
02:08:56.320 --> 02:09:00.760
<v Speaker 1>we drank them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then amazing experience.</v>

2338
02:09:00.761 --> 02:09:02.800
<v Speaker 1>I bonded with my brother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was beautiful.</v>

2339
02:09:02.801 --> 02:09:04.840
<v Speaker 1>And then you're peaking at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>

2340
02:09:04.841 --> 02:09:07.480
<v Speaker 1>You look around and there's like tens of</v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands is modular.</v>

2341
02:09:07.540 --> 02:09:08.230
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my gosh,</v>

2342
02:09:09.490 --> 02:09:10.700
<v Speaker 1>all for science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2343
02:09:11.020 --> 02:09:16.020
<v Speaker 1>and so I go To bed and I'm laying in bed</v>
<v Speaker 1>in full blown experience.</v>

2344
02:09:18.401 --> 02:09:23.401
<v Speaker 1>And can barely sleep because all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>colors are keeping me awake and my mind </v>

2345
02:09:23.981 --> 02:09:28.981
<v Speaker 1>is racing and then I have a lucid dream </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm dreaming and I wake up and I go </v>

2346
02:09:31.991 --> 02:09:32.980
<v Speaker 1>downstairs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

2347
02:09:33.190 --> 02:09:36.010
<v Speaker 1>I had this crazy dream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's your dream?</v>

2348
02:09:36.011 --> 02:09:41.011
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw thousands of cattle dead baking in</v>

2349
02:09:41.321 --> 02:09:43.390
<v Speaker 1>the sun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

2350
02:09:44.230 --> 02:09:45.700
<v Speaker 1>I think there's going to be a nuclear </v>
<v Speaker 1>war,</v>

2351
02:09:46.110 --> 02:09:49.040
<v Speaker 1>but what could kill all these cattle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2352
02:09:49.050 --> 02:09:52.390
<v Speaker 1>at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reagan administration and all that,</v>

2353
02:09:54.100 --> 02:09:57.640
<v Speaker 1>the tension was really high between the </v>
<v Speaker 1>soviet union and United States.</v>

2354
02:09:58.300 --> 02:10:00.280
<v Speaker 1>And they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they were joking with me saying,</v>

2355
02:10:00.281 --> 02:10:00.790
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2356
02:10:00.880 --> 02:10:01.560
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2357
02:10:01.810 --> 02:10:02.980
<v Speaker 1>when it's gonna to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

2358
02:10:03.010 --> 02:10:08.010
<v Speaker 1>I know I was in olympia and I needed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>rush up to darrington to stay in my </v>

2359
02:10:08.010 --> 02:10:09.880
<v Speaker 1>cabin because my books are up there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My manuscript was up there.</v>

2360
02:10:09.881 --> 02:10:11.560
<v Speaker 1>I need to save,</v>
<v Speaker 1>save my research.</v>

2361
02:10:12.670 --> 02:10:14.260
<v Speaker 1>So they laughed and they laughed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They said,</v>

2362
02:10:14.261 --> 02:10:15.640
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when's the world going to end?</v>

2363
02:10:15.641 --> 02:10:16.420
<v Speaker 1>Paul?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I go,</v>

2364
02:10:16.421 --> 02:10:18.130
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's not this weekend.</v>

2365
02:10:18.260 --> 02:10:20.860
<v Speaker 1>That was like in two days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's next weekend.</v>

2366
02:10:21.190 --> 02:10:24.070
<v Speaker 1>So they wrote on the calendar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>December 1st,</v>

2367
02:10:24.400 --> 02:10:26.860
<v Speaker 1>I put it in my book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's 1975,</v>

2368
02:10:27.280 --> 02:10:30.430
<v Speaker 1>the end of the world that wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>paul predicts the end of the world.</v>

2369
02:10:31.540 --> 02:10:35.720
<v Speaker 1>So we forgot about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Massive rains the next week,</v>

2370
02:10:36.050 --> 02:10:37.640
<v Speaker 1>huge amounts of snowfall.</v>

2371
02:10:38.700 --> 02:10:40.180
<v Speaker 1>And then on wednesday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thursday,</v>

2372
02:10:40.181 --> 02:10:44.020
<v Speaker 1>temperature inversion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it flipped to 75 to 85 degrees.</v>

2373
02:10:44.800 --> 02:10:49.800
<v Speaker 1>All the snow started to melt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the rivers were flooding and my </v>

2374
02:10:49.800 --> 02:10:53.581
<v Speaker 1>little cabin was right next to this </v>
<v Speaker 1>river that would swell from date and </v>

2375
02:10:53.581 --> 02:10:58.290
<v Speaker 1>have a morning tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It go up six feet just from the snow </v>

2376
02:10:58.290 --> 02:11:02.401
<v Speaker 1>melt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And because we're very close to this </v>

2377
02:11:02.401 --> 02:11:02.401
<v Speaker 1>volcano and the glaciers as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my gosh,</v>

2378
02:11:02.401 --> 02:11:03.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna lose my manuscript.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All my research.</v>

2379
02:11:03.461 --> 02:11:04.870
<v Speaker 1>I need to get up there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to go up there.</v>

2380
02:11:05.230 --> 02:11:07.660
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm watching the news on news and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the roads are being closed.</v>

2381
02:11:07.661 --> 02:11:09.220
<v Speaker 1>So I had to go through rockport,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Washington,</v>

2382
02:11:09.221 --> 02:11:10.810
<v Speaker 1>the back way in order to get back to my </v>
<v Speaker 1>cabin.</v>

2383
02:11:10.811 --> 02:11:14.560
<v Speaker 1>I get to my cabin and the bank had </v>
<v Speaker 1>eroded about 10 feet.</v>

2384
02:11:14.561 --> 02:11:16.210
<v Speaker 1>I was only about 10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>12 feet away from the,</v>

2385
02:11:16.240 --> 02:11:16.810
<v Speaker 1>from the river.</v>

2386
02:11:16.810 --> 02:11:19.090
<v Speaker 1>Now my cabin was on the verge of falling</v>
<v Speaker 1>into it,</v>

2387
02:11:19.091 --> 02:11:22.360
<v Speaker 1>but I thought my manuscript,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got all my books and I rescued all the</v>

2388
02:11:22.361 --> 02:11:25.540
<v Speaker 1>material,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had medical and get out of there because</v>

2389
02:11:25.541 --> 02:11:28.070
<v Speaker 1>the roads that have been closed and so I</v>
<v Speaker 1>had to wait,</v>

2390
02:11:28.090 --> 02:11:33.090
<v Speaker 1>wait two days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two days and the roads then opened up </v>

2391
02:11:33.090 --> 02:11:36.990
<v Speaker 1>and I drove out out of the valley and to</v>
<v Speaker 1>snohomish valley and I went around the </v>

2392
02:11:37.481 --> 02:11:41.410
<v Speaker 1>bend and there the son that was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>brilliant sunny day,</v>

2393
02:11:41.470 --> 02:11:46.470
<v Speaker 1>a warm day and there floating in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fields were hundreds and hundreds of </v>

2394
02:11:46.470 --> 02:11:51.050
<v Speaker 1>dead cattle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you explain that?</v>

2395
02:11:53.260 --> 02:11:55.090
<v Speaker 1>I entered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think into the multiverse.</v>

2396
02:11:55.820 --> 02:11:56.700
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2397
02:11:57.890 --> 02:12:02.890
<v Speaker 2>now as a scientist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you realize when you say something like </v>

2398
02:12:02.890 --> 02:12:02.890
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you open yourself up to ridicule.</v>

2399
02:12:02.890 --> 02:12:04.820
<v Speaker 2>Do you feel hesitant to communicate </v>
<v Speaker 2>these ideas?</v>

2400
02:12:05.350 --> 02:12:06.340
<v Speaker 1>to a degree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

2401
02:12:06.341 --> 02:12:08.290
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm 62 years of age and you know,</v>

2402
02:12:08.291 --> 02:12:11.050
<v Speaker 1>at one point I just don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't care.</v>

2403
02:12:11.110 --> 02:12:12.760
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is true.</v>

2404
02:12:12.761 --> 02:12:17.761
<v Speaker 1>This happened to me and I can push the </v>
<v Speaker 1>envelope on these ideas because the </v>

2405
02:12:17.761 --> 02:12:19.090
<v Speaker 1>credibility of My research as well </v>
<v Speaker 1>established.</v>

2406
02:12:19.180 --> 02:12:24.180
<v Speaker 1>I can save the bees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you care whether I have taken </v>

2407
02:12:24.180 --> 02:12:25.660
<v Speaker 1>silicide mushrooms?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I can save your farm,</v>

2408
02:12:25.720 --> 02:12:27.790
<v Speaker 1>your family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your country or the world?</v>

2409
02:12:27.940 --> 02:12:29.950
<v Speaker 1>Billions of dollars and protect </v>
<v Speaker 1>biosecurity.</v>

2410
02:12:30.130 --> 02:12:31.660
<v Speaker 1>I care more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I care more.</v>

2411
02:12:31.840 --> 02:12:33.940
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm telling you things.</v>

2412
02:12:33.941 --> 02:12:36.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm not making these up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just.</v>

2413
02:12:37.890 --> 02:12:42.890
<v Speaker 1>But just because you can't explain it </v>
<v Speaker 1>does not mean it's not true and I think </v>

2414
02:12:42.890 --> 02:12:47.251
<v Speaker 1>that we need to accept the fact that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>reality is not limited to the perception</v>

2415
02:12:47.590 --> 02:12:51.350
<v Speaker 1>that we have traditionally used.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a beautiful way to describe it.</v>

2416
02:12:52.040 --> 02:12:54.560
<v Speaker 2>Let's end with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's perfect.</v>
