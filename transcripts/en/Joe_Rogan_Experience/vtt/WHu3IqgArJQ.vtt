00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:02.850
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:04.410
<v Speaker 1>So as soon as you have that,</v>

3
00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:05.490
<v Speaker 1>you don't have any data.</v>

4
00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:06.780
<v Speaker 1>So if you don't have any data,</v>

5
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:07.690
<v Speaker 1>then you've got to go.</v>

6
00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:09.360
<v Speaker 1>How you banning people for this?</v>

7
00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.000
<v Speaker 1>Like Ronda Rousey fucking went off today.</v>

8
00:00:12.001 --> 00:00:12.870
<v Speaker 1>It was beautiful.</v>

9
00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:13.681
<v Speaker 1>I watched that clip.</v>

10
00:00:13.681 --> 00:00:16.470
<v Speaker 1>She went off and drop the mic after it was over.</v>

11
00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:18.750
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that she said,</v>

12
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.790
<v Speaker 1>I totally agree with about marijuana.</v>

13
00:00:20.791 --> 00:00:21.930
<v Speaker 1>She said this in the past too.</v>

14
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.360
<v Speaker 1>It's an invasion of privacy is what it is.</v>

15
00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.430
<v Speaker 1>You're invading someone's privacy.</v>

16
00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:28.200
<v Speaker 1>Just like the fact that if you're,</v>

17
00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.760
<v Speaker 1>if you work for a company and the company decides to test you and you,</v>

18
00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.080
<v Speaker 1>you work all week,</v>

19
00:00:34.081 --> 00:00:35.100
<v Speaker 1>you do a great job,</v>

20
00:00:35.101 --> 00:00:35.934
<v Speaker 1>you work hard.</v>

21
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.150
<v Speaker 1>And then Fridays since five o'clock baby,</v>

22
00:00:39.151 --> 00:00:39.984
<v Speaker 1>it's over.</v>

23
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.160
<v Speaker 1>You want to smoke a joint,</v>

24
00:00:41.161 --> 00:00:41.880
<v Speaker 1>your home,</v>

25
00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:42.870
<v Speaker 1>you worked all day.</v>

26
00:00:42.871 --> 00:00:44.430
<v Speaker 1>You want to watch the walking dead.</v>

27
00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.440
<v Speaker 1>You want to put your feet up and you want to get high.</v>

28
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:47.693
<v Speaker 1>You can't,</v>

29
00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:49.590
<v Speaker 1>you fucking can't cause they own you.</v>

30
00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:50.790
<v Speaker 1>They own you.</v>

31
00:00:50.791 --> 00:00:52.110
<v Speaker 1>They own your flesh.</v>

32
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.250
<v Speaker 1>They literally own your mind when you're not there because everyone knows that</v>

33
00:00:56.251 --> 00:00:58.590
<v Speaker 1>marijuana is not psychoactive permanently.</v>

34
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.400
<v Speaker 1>It's not like you smoke a joint on Friday and then you show up on Monday</v>

35
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:02.401
<v Speaker 1>morning.</v>

36
00:01:02.401 --> 00:01:04.830
<v Speaker 1>You're still high as fuck and you're high for the rest of your life.</v>

37
00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.000
<v Speaker 1>That's not the case.</v>

38
00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:06.961
<v Speaker 1>So if you,</v>

39
00:01:06.961 --> 00:01:07.740
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

40
00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:08.790
<v Speaker 1>if you smoke pot,</v>

41
00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.060
<v Speaker 1>you will be tested four or five weeks from now,</v>

42
00:01:12.061 --> 00:01:13.740
<v Speaker 1>you will still test positive.</v>

43
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.170
<v Speaker 1>If you don't smoke any pot,</v>

44
00:01:16.171 --> 00:01:16.650
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

45
00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.520
<v Speaker 1>you get high right now and then four weeks from now they give you a urinalysis</v>

46
00:01:20.521 --> 00:01:20.791
<v Speaker 1>test.</v>

47
00:01:20.791 --> 00:01:21.990
<v Speaker 1>Depending on what they're looking for.</v>

48
00:01:21.991 --> 00:01:23.700
<v Speaker 1>If they're just trying to trace metabolites,</v>

49
00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.860
<v Speaker 1>you can still test positive and four weeks.</v>

50
00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:27.600
<v Speaker 1>That's fucking insane.</v>

51
00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:29.700
<v Speaker 1>It's simply a control thing.</v>

52
00:01:29.701 --> 00:01:30.390
<v Speaker 1>It's a power thing.</v>

53
00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.200
<v Speaker 1>It's a power thing.</v>

54
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.740
<v Speaker 1>These people or government people or government people that like to be able to</v>

55
00:01:34.741 --> 00:01:35.670
<v Speaker 1>tell people what to do.</v>

56
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:36.900
<v Speaker 1>That's my concern though,</v>

57
00:01:36.901 --> 00:01:38.160
<v Speaker 1>is if it's a power thing,</v>

58
00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.480
<v Speaker 1>how deep is it?</v>

59
00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:41.490
<v Speaker 1>How many levels does it go to?</v>

60
00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.700
<v Speaker 1>How many judges are friends would not admit should find out.</v>

61
00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:45.211
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

62
00:01:45.211 --> 00:01:46.920
<v Speaker 1>well they probably already on the case,</v>

63
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.320
<v Speaker 1>but ultimately I hope they're on the case.</v>

64
00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:50.400
<v Speaker 1>Ultimately,</v>

65
00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:52.830
<v Speaker 1>Catholic public outcry,</v>

66
00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:53.041
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

67
00:01:53.041 --> 00:01:54.030
<v Speaker 1>this is a tyranny.</v>

68
00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.670
<v Speaker 1>These are a few people that are deciding,</v>

69
00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:57.653
<v Speaker 1>which is this.</v>

70
00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:58.231
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

71
00:01:58.231 --> 00:02:00.510
<v Speaker 1>we're not talking about steroids here,</v>

72
00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.160
<v Speaker 1>we're just talking about pot.</v>

73
00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:03.780
<v Speaker 1>It just doesn't make sense.</v>

74
00:02:03.781 --> 00:02:08.781
<v Speaker 1>And we're also talking about a guy who passed to World Anti Doping Agency tests.</v>

75
00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.400
<v Speaker 1>Those are the most trick fucking tests in the world of sports.</v>

76
00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.160
<v Speaker 1>He passed two of those and failed a quest.</v>

77
00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.150
<v Speaker 1>I think it's quest.</v>

78
00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.941
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

79
00:02:18.941 --> 00:02:19.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm a,</v>

80
00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:20.610
<v Speaker 1>I apologize from wrong,</v>

81
00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.410
<v Speaker 1>but the bottom line is the tests were not the test that you need when you're</v>

82
00:02:25.411 --> 00:02:30.411
<v Speaker 1>taking away a guy's fucking livelihood and you're finding him for $165,000 out</v>

83
00:02:30.421 --> 00:02:31.890
<v Speaker 1>of a $500,000 purse,</v>

84
00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.940
<v Speaker 1>which by the way,</v>

85
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.500
<v Speaker 1>he has to pay his managers.</v>

86
00:02:34.501 --> 00:02:35.850
<v Speaker 1>He has to pay taxes,</v>

87
00:02:35.851 --> 00:02:37.350
<v Speaker 1>he has to be all these different things.</v>

88
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.180
<v Speaker 1>When you make 500 grand,</v>

89
00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.940
<v Speaker 1>you don't make 500 grand because you have a manager,</v>

90
00:02:41.941 --> 00:02:45.300
<v Speaker 1>the manager has 10% you ha you might have an agent and the agent gets a piece.</v>

91
00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:46.530
<v Speaker 1>You might have a lawyer,</v>

92
00:02:46.531 --> 00:02:47.820
<v Speaker 1>you might have a business manager,</v>

93
00:02:47.821 --> 00:02:48.570
<v Speaker 1>you might have,</v>

94
00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:49.650
<v Speaker 1>you have to pay taxes.</v>

95
00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:50.551
<v Speaker 1>You have training,</v>

96
00:02:50.551 --> 00:02:51.860
<v Speaker 1>expensive training partners.</v>

97
00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.150
<v Speaker 1>All you mean you have to be very strict.</v>

98
00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.270
<v Speaker 1>And Nick is notoriously disciplined with his diet.</v>

99
00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:58.140
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's,</v>

100
00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.800
<v Speaker 1>he eats all food.</v>

101
00:02:59.801 --> 00:03:01.120
<v Speaker 1>He's mostly Vegan,</v>

102
00:03:01.121 --> 00:03:02.590
<v Speaker 1>except I think he had some fish.</v>

103
00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:04.420
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't need any land animals.</v>

104
00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.760
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

105
00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.040
<v Speaker 1>and he does this based on the effect on his body because he's an extreme</v>

106
00:03:09.041 --> 00:03:09.821
<v Speaker 1>endurance athlete.</v>

107
00:03:09.821 --> 00:03:13.030
<v Speaker 1>He does a lot of triathlons and he does a lot of running.</v>

108
00:03:13.031 --> 00:03:15.670
<v Speaker 1>He swam back and forth from Alcatraz twice.</v>

109
00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:16.091
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

110
00:03:16.091 --> 00:03:16.990
<v Speaker 1>he's a motherfucker,</v>

111
00:03:16.991 --> 00:03:17.231
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

112
00:03:17.231 --> 00:03:18.430
<v Speaker 1>He takes care of his body.</v>

113
00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:20.620
<v Speaker 1>And if he's smoking pot,</v>

114
00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:22.840
<v Speaker 1>that should tell you the pot's not bad for your body.</v>

115
00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:24.430
<v Speaker 1>It's real simple.</v>

116
00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:25.930
<v Speaker 1>But he's not cheating.</v>

117
00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.490
<v Speaker 1>He's not doing steroids.</v>

118
00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.530
<v Speaker 1>He's not doing anything that gives them an unfair advantage.</v>

119
00:03:29.531 --> 00:03:30.460
<v Speaker 1>He's working hard,</v>

120
00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:35.470
<v Speaker 1>he's tough as shit and he fucking fight smart and these assholes,</v>

121
00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.700
<v Speaker 1>they stole his ability to entertain people and he's one of the most popular guys</v>

122
00:03:39.701 --> 00:03:40.720
<v Speaker 1>in the fucking sport.</v>

123
00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:42.820
<v Speaker 1>When he came back and fought Anderson Silva,</v>

124
00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.980
<v Speaker 1>the paper view was through the roof.</v>

125
00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.120
<v Speaker 1>And why was that?</v>

126
00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.571
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

127
00:03:46.571 --> 00:03:49.780
<v Speaker 1>partly because when people want to see what Anderson Silva would look like after</v>

128
00:03:49.781 --> 00:03:51.280
<v Speaker 1>he came back from a leg injury,</v>

129
00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:52.690
<v Speaker 1>this horrific leg break,</v>

130
00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.850
<v Speaker 1>but also it's because he's fighting Nick Diaz.</v>

131
00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.520
<v Speaker 1>You know Nikki has going to talk shit to him like he did.</v>

132
00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:58.720
<v Speaker 1>Like he got in his face.</v>

133
00:03:58.721 --> 00:03:58.961
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>

134
00:03:58.961 --> 00:03:59.501
<v Speaker 1>what bitch?</v>

135
00:03:59.501 --> 00:04:00.100
<v Speaker 1>What bitch?</v>

136
00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.080
<v Speaker 1>Like nobody had ever done that to Anderson Silva before.</v>

137
00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.050
<v Speaker 1>He laid down on the ground like he was making a sleepy face.</v>

138
00:04:05.051 --> 00:04:05.201
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

139
00:04:05.201 --> 00:04:05.381
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

140
00:04:05.381 --> 00:04:07.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm sleep and you're born the fuck out of me.</v>

141
00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:08.350
<v Speaker 1>And jumped back up to his feet.</v>

142
00:04:08.351 --> 00:04:12.160
<v Speaker 1>He humiliated Anderson completely fucked with his head inside that cage.</v>

143
00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:14.200
<v Speaker 1>That's what people paid for.</v>

144
00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:19.650
<v Speaker 1>And what he is experiencing right now is a bunch of assholes taken away.</v>

145
00:04:19.721 --> 00:04:20.740
<v Speaker 1>His ability to compete,</v>

146
00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:24.070
<v Speaker 1>taken away his ability to thrill people at what he does best.</v>

147
00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:28.540
<v Speaker 1>It's guys worked for more than a fucking decade as a professional mixed martial</v>

148
00:04:28.541 --> 00:04:29.374
<v Speaker 1>arts fighter.</v>

149
00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.340
<v Speaker 1>More than who knows how many years before that training and learning how to</v>

150
00:04:33.341 --> 00:04:35.950
<v Speaker 1>fight all that's taken away by some assholes.</v>

151
00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:37.720
<v Speaker 2>We're moving back to Spain.</v>

152
00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:38.573
<v Speaker 2>The and you know.</v>

153
00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:39.430
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

154
00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.940
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

155
00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:40.390
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

156
00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.571
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

157
00:04:40.571 --> 00:04:41.530
<v Speaker 2>I mean this was always a,</v>

158
00:04:41.531 --> 00:04:42.850
<v Speaker 2>a temporary visit.</v>

159
00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:48.210
<v Speaker 2>This was a slow nomadic trip through North American Portland and then Spain.</v>

160
00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:49.360
<v Speaker 2>Well it was,</v>

161
00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.781
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

162
00:04:49.781 --> 00:04:51.010
<v Speaker 2>first it was Vancouver,</v>

163
00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:53.440
<v Speaker 2>Canada and uh,</v>

164
00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:55.270
<v Speaker 2>then we were in Nicaragua for the winter.</v>

165
00:04:55.271 --> 00:04:58.600
<v Speaker 2>Then we went back to Vancouver and then we came to la for the winter is when,</v>

166
00:04:58.630 --> 00:04:58.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

167
00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:02.140
<v Speaker 2>you and I had Dunkin started doing the shrimp parade and all that.</v>

168
00:05:02.141 --> 00:05:03.220
<v Speaker 2>I was living in Topanga,</v>

169
00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:05.110
<v Speaker 2>but it's always like a slow move.</v>

170
00:05:05.111 --> 00:05:09.580
<v Speaker 2>And then we went to Portland for a year and a half and now we're going to go</v>

171
00:05:09.581 --> 00:05:10.680
<v Speaker 2>back to Barcelona.</v>

172
00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.660
<v Speaker 2>What made you decide to go back?</v>

173
00:05:13.661 --> 00:05:13.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

174
00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:15.700
<v Speaker 2>well we were always planning to go back.</v>

175
00:05:15.701 --> 00:05:16.510
<v Speaker 2>I mean we,</v>

176
00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:20.060
<v Speaker 2>we sort of flirted with maybe staying for a while.</v>

177
00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:20.890
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

178
00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:25.000
<v Speaker 2>but my wife's a doctor and for her to get a license in the u s would mean like</v>

179
00:05:25.001 --> 00:05:26.860
<v Speaker 2>going back to medical school essentially,</v>

180
00:05:26.861 --> 00:05:27.820
<v Speaker 2>which she's not going to do.</v>

181
00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:28.653
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

182
00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:29.440
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

183
00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:32.470
<v Speaker 2>and she really likes,</v>

184
00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:33.250
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

185
00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:33.940
<v Speaker 2>working.</v>

186
00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:36.880
<v Speaker 2>She hasn't worked in four years while we've been traveling.</v>

187
00:05:36.881 --> 00:05:37.714
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

188
00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:38.111
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

189
00:05:38.111 --> 00:05:38.950
<v Speaker 2>that's an issue.</v>

190
00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:41.260
<v Speaker 2>Like if she's going to continue practicing.</v>

191
00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:41.980
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

192
00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:43.960
<v Speaker 2>but also just that we really liked Spain.</v>

193
00:05:43.961 --> 00:05:44.111
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

194
00:05:44.111 --> 00:05:46.000
<v Speaker 2>I've lived in Spain most of my life.</v>

195
00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:46.750
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

196
00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:49.450
<v Speaker 2>I've lived in Barcelona longer than I've lived anywhere else,</v>

197
00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:49.830
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

198
00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:52.600
<v Speaker 2>and what is it about Barcelona that's more appealing in America?</v>

199
00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:53.261
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

200
00:05:53.261 --> 00:05:55.030
<v Speaker 2>when I first got to Spain,</v>

201
00:05:55.300 --> 00:06:00.300
<v Speaker 2>I felt I traveled a lot and I was actually on my way somewhere else,</v>

202
00:06:01.041 --> 00:06:02.360
<v Speaker 2>but I got robbed and,</v>

203
00:06:02.361 --> 00:06:02.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

204
00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:07.670
<v Speaker 2>I ended up hanging out and the way Spanish people see life,</v>

205
00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:08.700
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

206
00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:11.060
<v Speaker 2>is much closer to the way I see life.</v>

207
00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:14.360
<v Speaker 2>And so even though I was raised in America,</v>

208
00:06:14.361 --> 00:06:18.710
<v Speaker 2>I never felt like this country never really made sense to me.</v>

209
00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:19.613
<v Speaker 2>How so?</v>

210
00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:20.121
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

211
00:06:20.121 --> 00:06:21.860
<v Speaker 2>like what we're just talking about like work,</v>

212
00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:22.790
<v Speaker 2>materialism,</v>

213
00:06:22.791 --> 00:06:23.990
<v Speaker 2>materialism,</v>

214
00:06:23.991 --> 00:06:24.561
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

215
00:06:24.561 --> 00:06:25.790
<v Speaker 2>it's all about the money.</v>

216
00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:27.110
<v Speaker 2>Spanish people that,</v>

217
00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:27.411
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

218
00:06:27.411 --> 00:06:28.970
<v Speaker 2>the expression is we work to live.</v>

219
00:06:28.971 --> 00:06:29.930
<v Speaker 2>We don't live to work.</v>

220
00:06:29.931 --> 00:06:30.600
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

221
00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:31.070
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

222
00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:31.431
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

223
00:06:31.431 --> 00:06:31.851
<v Speaker 2>there no,</v>

224
00:06:31.851 --> 00:06:33.200
<v Speaker 2>like Spanish cars.</v>

225
00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:35.360
<v Speaker 2>There's no cup holder if you want.</v>

226
00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:36.290
<v Speaker 2>Do you want to get a drink?</v>

227
00:06:36.291 --> 00:06:38.000
<v Speaker 2>Pull over in a cafe and get a drink?</v>

228
00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:39.860
<v Speaker 2>There are no to go cups.</v>

229
00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:40.970
<v Speaker 2>You want a coffee?</v>

230
00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:41.990
<v Speaker 2>Go to a cafe.</v>

231
00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:42.830

<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

233
00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:47.360
<v Speaker 2>there it's like someone should tell them about cups and lids on them.</v>

234
00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:49.670
<v Speaker 2>The fuck is wrong with those tapes.</v>

235
00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:51.200
<v Speaker 2>Crazy,</v>

236
00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:52.220

00:06:52.221 --> 00:06:54.140
<v Speaker 2>heathen fucking cave people.</v>

238
00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:54.670
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

239
00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:55.503
<v Speaker 2>sack hops.</v>

240
00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:55.790
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

241
00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:56.960
<v Speaker 2>even though Spain is,</v>

242
00:06:56.961 --> 00:06:57.291
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

243
00:06:57.291 --> 00:06:58.940
<v Speaker 2>officially a Catholic country,</v>

244
00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:01.550
<v Speaker 2>there's so much more chilled out about sex,</v>

245
00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:02.653
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

246

<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

251
00:07:06.171 --> 00:07:07.400
<v Speaker 2>Just don't tell me about it.</v>

252
00:07:07.401 --> 00:07:09.380
<v Speaker 2>That's the sort of normal way to deal with it.</v>

253
00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:10.643
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

254

259
00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:18.260
<v Speaker 2>I get accustomed when I see a beautiful woman.</v>

260
00:07:18.261 --> 00:07:22.430
<v Speaker 2>I look at her and she knows I'm looking at her and she appreciates it and she</v>

261
00:07:22.431 --> 00:07:24.410
<v Speaker 2>smiles and I smile and everybody's happy.</v>
