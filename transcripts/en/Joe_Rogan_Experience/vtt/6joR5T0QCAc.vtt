00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:10.090
<v Speaker 1>Secondary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Joe Rogan experience my day,</v>

2
00:00:10.091 --> 00:00:14.710
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan podcast by day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ryan Parsons,</v>

3
00:00:14.711 --> 00:00:16.270
<v Speaker 1>my friend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good to see you,</v>

4
00:00:16.271 --> 00:00:18.270
<v Speaker 1>brother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing well.</v>

5
00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:20.920
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for having me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for being on man out there.</v>

6
00:00:20.921 --> 00:00:22.990
<v Speaker 1>Kicking ass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>managing fighters,</v>

7
00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.050
<v Speaker 1>getting numb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cutting edge of science and training</v>

8
00:00:26.051 --> 00:00:29.350
<v Speaker 1>and nutrition and every time I talked to</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got some new cutting edge type shit.</v>

9
00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:30.580
<v Speaker 1>What it's about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

10
00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:32.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today it's an improvement to today.</v>

11
00:00:32.291 --> 00:00:35.380
<v Speaker 1>Ryan came in with these new gloves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these a radius,</v>

12
00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.710
<v Speaker 1>mma gloves that literally you can punch </v>
<v Speaker 1>a wall with these things on and they </v>

13
00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.701
<v Speaker 1>don't hurt your hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never experienced anything like </v>

14
00:00:44.701 --> 00:00:44.701
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really interesting.</v>

15
00:00:44.701 --> 00:00:47.950
<v Speaker 1>So there's like this red.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what this is,</v>

16
00:00:47.951 --> 00:00:52.180
<v Speaker 1>this red hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>high density foam or closed cell foam.</v>

17
00:00:52.181 --> 00:00:55.240
<v Speaker 1>Now there's three sides of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it started years ago,</v>

18
00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.550
<v Speaker 1>a fighter who had a boxers knuckle that </v>
<v Speaker 1>was so swollen,</v>

19
00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:00.970
<v Speaker 1>inflamed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you just tapped it,</v>

20
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.960
<v Speaker 1>it would be painful for them.</v>

21
00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.180
<v Speaker 1>So for a year it affected everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we did.</v>

22
00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.100
<v Speaker 1>He couldn't hit mid sparring and every </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit and we wrapped it with tape,</v>

23
00:01:09.101 --> 00:01:10.960
<v Speaker 1>with gauze,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sponges,</v>

24
00:01:10.961 --> 00:01:14.860
<v Speaker 1>everything we could do to try to figure </v>
<v Speaker 1>out how to take the pain away because if</v>

25
00:01:14.861 --> 00:01:19.861
<v Speaker 1>you're going to fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to punch and it continues to </v>

26
00:01:19.861 --> 00:01:24.121
<v Speaker 1>get irritated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I failed and we didn't come up with </v>

27
00:01:24.121 --> 00:01:24.310
<v Speaker 1>any solution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was the end of it.</v>

28
00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.850
<v Speaker 1>Fast forward a couple years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pet cummings durkin developed the exact </v>

29
00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.081
<v Speaker 1>same,</v>
<v Speaker 1>huge swollen middle knuckle and there's </v>

30
00:01:34.081 --> 00:01:35.530
<v Speaker 1>a handrail at the UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a cut man,</v>

31
00:01:35.531 --> 00:01:40.531
<v Speaker 1>Rudy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he had a different approach to </v>

32
00:01:40.531 --> 00:01:42.631
<v Speaker 1>wrapping hands and he would place the </v>
<v Speaker 1>underneath the knuckle,</v>

33
00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.760
<v Speaker 1>not on top pads.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The knuckle like this,</v>

34
00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:47.740
<v Speaker 1>you can't really padded enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if,</v>

35
00:01:47.741 --> 00:01:49.060
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're punching with the knuckle,</v>

36
00:01:49.061 --> 00:01:52.210
<v Speaker 1>it stresses the bones in your hand or </v>
<v Speaker 1>your wrist and sometimes your elbow.</v>

37
00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.030
<v Speaker 1>So he explained that it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had the boxing,</v>

38
00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.350
<v Speaker 1>the handgrip guys in the sixties and </v>
<v Speaker 1>seventies in boxing used to wrap where </v>

39
00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.350
<v Speaker 1>you put the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

40
00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.100
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pad on the bottom of the knuckles.</v>

41
00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.800
<v Speaker 1>And if you put your fingers like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a natural flex that's involved </v>

42
00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.360
<v Speaker 1>with your hands and it saves punching </v>
<v Speaker 1>here and decreases the stress here.</v>

43
00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.810
<v Speaker 1>So instead of putting it over the Naco,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're like looking at a fist coming </v>

44
00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:16.990
<v Speaker 1>your way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would put it below.</v>

45
00:02:16.991 --> 00:02:18.580
<v Speaker 1>So for folks who are just listening to </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

46
00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.240
<v Speaker 1>you would just put it below the bumps of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the knuckle,</v>

47
00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.770
<v Speaker 1>the brush where the bone sticks out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

48
00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.800
<v Speaker 1>And this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is this something you developed </v>

49
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.800
<v Speaker 1>yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I watched him do that now here,</v>

50
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.690
<v Speaker 1>take this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was reaching for his thing and I'm</v>

51
00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:40.490
<v Speaker 1>knocked over my coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've done this a hundred times on a </v>

52
00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.490
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>

53
00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:42.340
<v Speaker 1>That's all right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No electronics were damaged.</v>

54
00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:45.010
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

55
00:02:45.011 --> 00:02:50.011
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kinda saw that he was doing with the </v>

56
00:02:50.011 --> 00:02:52.291
<v Speaker 1>guys and we played around with it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the experience with um,</v>

57
00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.930
<v Speaker 1>the fighter a few years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then with pat it was something that </v>

58
00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.930
<v Speaker 1>was really affecting our day to day </v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

59
00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.790
<v Speaker 1>So we kind of took that concept and </v>
<v Speaker 1>expanded upon it and we tested so many </v>

60
00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.830
<v Speaker 1>different styles of foam shapes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>densities,</v>

61
00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:11.070
<v Speaker 1>and we ended up with this and I made a </v>
<v Speaker 1>prototype at home and pat started using.</v>

62
00:03:11.801 --> 00:03:13.810
<v Speaker 1>We'd walk around my kitchen with their </v>
<v Speaker 1>hands wrapped,</v>

63
00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.290
<v Speaker 1>punching the granite countertops and no </v>
<v Speaker 1>boy,</v>

64
00:03:17.291 --> 00:03:19.240
<v Speaker 1>there's something here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it is,</v>

65
00:03:19.241 --> 00:03:22.000
<v Speaker 1>but this really works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Pat started to use them in training.</v>

66
00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.560
<v Speaker 1>I didn't pay attention for a couple </v>
<v Speaker 1>weeks and I saw that every day he was </v>

67
00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.560
<v Speaker 1>washing the same handwriting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

68
00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:32.280
<v Speaker 1>should we get you some new handed </v>
<v Speaker 1>because none of the other ones don't </v>

69
00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.280
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>

70
00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.520
<v Speaker 1>This is the one I like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that kind of was our little light </v>

71
00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.520
<v Speaker 1>bulb moment right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It said,</v>

72
00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.150
<v Speaker 1>we've got to figure out what's going on </v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

73
00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.950
<v Speaker 1>So what are those?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When a boxer gets that knuckle,</v>

74
00:03:39.951 --> 00:03:40.810
<v Speaker 1>like boxers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Michael,</v>

75
00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.440
<v Speaker 1>what is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a terribly irritated.</v>

76
00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.320
<v Speaker 1>The tendon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the attending can get torn,</v>

77
00:03:47.321 --> 00:03:50.800
<v Speaker 1>all the soft tissues around it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the joint capsule gets what's swelled up</v>

78
00:03:50.801 --> 00:03:54.910
<v Speaker 1>and your knuckle hurts your whole hand </v>
<v Speaker 1>or to decrease his grip strength.</v>

79
00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:57.430
<v Speaker 1>So especially in Emma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where grips so important,</v>

80
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.040
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden now you can't squeeze </v>
<v Speaker 1>like you can.</v>

81
00:04:00.041 --> 00:04:05.041
<v Speaker 1>You're grappling goes mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's really longterm implications of </v>

82
00:04:05.041 --> 00:04:06.580
<v Speaker 1>that and a lot of times these are </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems that plague fighters for years.</v>

83
00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:11.670
<v Speaker 1>What do you think about this idea?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been throwing this around a lot </v>

84
00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:15.331
<v Speaker 1>lately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that it might be better for </v>

85
00:04:15.331 --> 00:04:16.600
<v Speaker 1>everybody if there was no gloves.</v>

86
00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:22.150
<v Speaker 1>Well you'll have less knockouts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>less knockout.</v>

87
00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.940
<v Speaker 1>It was brain damage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have less hand damage,</v>

88
00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.030
<v Speaker 1>I might say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have more hand damaging.</v>

89
00:04:27.031 --> 00:04:27.940
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

90
00:04:27.941 --> 00:04:29.380
<v Speaker 1>Because gloves protect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

91
00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:32.080
<v Speaker 1>So you'll have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll have less brain damage,</v>

92
00:04:32.081 --> 00:04:33.880
<v Speaker 1>less gets initially,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

93
00:04:33.881 --> 00:04:38.881
<v Speaker 1>But wouldn't everybody like sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out what you can and can't get </v>

94
00:04:38.881 --> 00:04:40.620
<v Speaker 1>away with when it comes to punching?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't just fucking whale away.</v>

95
00:04:40.621 --> 00:04:44.440
<v Speaker 1>You have to be more precise in your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your implementation of strikes.</v>

96
00:04:44.441 --> 00:04:47.650
<v Speaker 1>I guess in theory that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you get in the middle of a fight and</v>

97
00:04:47.651 --> 00:04:50.020
<v Speaker 1>this happens all the time and training </v>
<v Speaker 1>paths.</v>

98
00:04:50.021 --> 00:04:55.021
<v Speaker 1>Boxers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knuckled didn't come initially from </v>

99
00:04:55.021 --> 00:04:55.021
<v Speaker 1>hitting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hitting pads.</v>

100
00:04:55.021 --> 00:04:57.250
<v Speaker 1>It came from an Emma mma glove and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>came into scramble situation,</v>

101
00:04:57.251 --> 00:05:02.251
<v Speaker 1>hit someone in the head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the heart part of their head and his </v>

102
00:05:02.251 --> 00:05:04.921
<v Speaker 1>knuckles swelled up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're going to get in the scramble </v>

103
00:05:04.921 --> 00:05:04.921
<v Speaker 1>situations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in Emma,</v>

104
00:05:04.921 --> 00:05:08.740
<v Speaker 1>Emma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're going to catch someone </v>

105
00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.551
<v Speaker 1>funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but don't you think that maybe there </v>

106
00:05:11.551 --> 00:05:14.171
<v Speaker 1>will be less leg breaks like we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>seeing with like Anderson Silva and </v>

107
00:05:14.171 --> 00:05:17.140
<v Speaker 1>tyrone spong if they were Shin pads for </v>
<v Speaker 1>sure,</v>

108
00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.900
<v Speaker 1>and we have more protection is going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be more protection.</v>

109
00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:21.100
<v Speaker 1>There's going to be less injuries with </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

110
00:05:21.101 --> 00:05:22.630
<v Speaker 1>but you have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no one's going to accept that.</v>

111
00:05:22.631 --> 00:05:23.860
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't go back.</v>

112
00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:25.820
<v Speaker 1>No one's going to say like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

113
00:05:25.821 --> 00:05:27.990
<v Speaker 1>if you start patting people shinzen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are going to go,</v>

114
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.670
<v Speaker 1>come on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are we doing visually?</v>

115
00:05:30.671 --> 00:05:31.720
<v Speaker 1>The fans are gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hate it,</v>

116
00:05:31.721 --> 00:05:35.440
<v Speaker 1>and also padding your shins or some </v>
<v Speaker 1>trouble with grappling with that.</v>

117
00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:37.690
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to grapple with with </v>
<v Speaker 1>shinguards,</v>

118
00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:39.920
<v Speaker 1>which brings me back to the gloves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to sink in.</v>

119
00:05:39.921 --> 00:05:44.921
<v Speaker 1>Chokes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to think in chokes those </v>

120
00:05:44.921 --> 00:05:44.921
<v Speaker 1>gloves like rear nakeds and things along</v>
<v Speaker 1>those lines.</v>

121
00:05:44.921 --> 00:05:47.230
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to lock up the correct hand position.</v>

122
00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:52.670
<v Speaker 1>Teens are tougher to get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a bunch of things that are </v>

123
00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:52.670
<v Speaker 1>tougher to secure your hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your hand grips true.</v>

124
00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:53.610
<v Speaker 1>It's a tradeoff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nana maybe right?</v>

125
00:05:53.611 --> 00:05:56.590
<v Speaker 1>There's a constant we give and take in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this sport,</v>

126
00:05:56.591 --> 00:05:57.980
<v Speaker 1>but it seems to me that</v>

127
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:02.980
<v Speaker 2>if you can hit someone with a raw elbow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rodney Roshan Rauf foot raw heal,</v>

128
00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:07.370
<v Speaker 2>you can heal someone in the head Aka,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

129
00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:09.080
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Edson Barboza,</v>

130
00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:14.110
<v Speaker 2>Terry Adam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is one of the worst knockouts </v>

131
00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:14.110
<v Speaker 2>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

132
00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:15.660
<v Speaker 2>we'll kick to the head the amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking force you generate.</v>

133
00:06:15.661 --> 00:06:18.910
<v Speaker 2>It's just insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But no,</v>

134
00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:20.460
<v Speaker 2>no padding at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

135
00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:25.570
<v Speaker 2>literally these pads are protecting the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hand more than they're protecting the </v>

136
00:06:25.641 --> 00:06:26.900
<v Speaker 2>fighter from damage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

137
00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:27.810
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For sure.</v>

138
00:06:27.811 --> 00:06:28.740
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Definitely.</v>

139
00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:30.980
<v Speaker 2>So if that's the case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's not like a,</v>

140
00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:34.530
<v Speaker 2>an almost like an a crutch for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>striker,</v>

141
00:06:34.531 --> 00:06:36.230
<v Speaker 2>for the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the person who's actually delivering</v>

142
00:06:36.231 --> 00:06:38.390
<v Speaker 2>the shots,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're giving them an unfair advantage.</v>

143
00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:43.630
<v Speaker 2>You're taping the wrist top and an </v>
<v Speaker 2>unnatural way because it's part of </v>

144
00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:43.630
<v Speaker 2>punching things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your risk buckle,</v>

145
00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:45.530
<v Speaker 2>like you have to learn how to punch </v>
<v Speaker 2>correctly.</v>

146
00:06:45.531 --> 00:06:50.531
<v Speaker 2>And you have to be much more diligent </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the placement of your punches </v>

147
00:06:50.531 --> 00:06:53.890
<v Speaker 2>because when you hit things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you've ever seen like a slow motion </v>

148
00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:53.890
<v Speaker 2>video of someone hitting something with </v>
<v Speaker 2>a bare knuckle,</v>

149
00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:56.450
<v Speaker 2>your fucking risk just gives our Nah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a joint.</v>

150
00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:58.700
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to keep stiff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

151
00:06:58.701 --> 00:07:03.701
<v Speaker 2>And I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we have an unrealistic </v>

152
00:07:03.701 --> 00:07:06.191
<v Speaker 2>perception of striking because of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fact that guys wear gloves and tape </v>

153
00:07:06.191 --> 00:07:07.730
<v Speaker 2>wraps and all that jazz.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's unrealistic.</v>

154
00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:10.930
<v Speaker 2>It definitely changes things for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

155
00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:15.940
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there could be an argument for </v>

156
00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:18.371
<v Speaker 2>it and I think it would probably save a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of shots that guys eat.</v>

157
00:07:19.401 --> 00:07:21.500
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the overall,</v>

158
00:07:21.501 --> 00:07:26.501
<v Speaker 2>like over the course of your career,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it would be significantly less </v>

159
00:07:26.501 --> 00:07:26.501
<v Speaker 2>impacts,</v>

160
00:07:26.501 --> 00:07:29.570
<v Speaker 3>but a lot of that cumulative traumas is </v>
<v Speaker 3>training based to.</v>

161
00:07:29.571 --> 00:07:30.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

162
00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:32.980
<v Speaker 3>So these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

163
00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:37.670
<v Speaker 3>we knew they worked and so we teamed up </v>
<v Speaker 3>with a sport science lab at Uc Fullerton</v>

164
00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:41.300
<v Speaker 3>and got a real phd pumping out real </v>
<v Speaker 3>research and said,</v>

165
00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:46.870
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can punch our granite countertops </v>

166
00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:48.701
<v Speaker 3>with these.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tell us if we're imagining this or it </v>

167
00:07:48.701 --> 00:07:48.701
<v Speaker 3>really works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he did a,</v>

168
00:07:48.701 --> 00:07:50.670
<v Speaker 3>the first of a series of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of uh,</v>

169
00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:53.780
<v Speaker 3>academic studies on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on this approach to it,</v>

170
00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:56.870
<v Speaker 3>and found a couple of things that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>reduce impact dramatically.</v>

171
00:07:56.871 --> 00:07:58.520
<v Speaker 3>And the white,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the ways they first tested it,</v>

172
00:07:58.521 --> 00:08:03.521
<v Speaker 3>they took a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an 18 to 35 and 50 pound Kettlebell and </v>

173
00:08:03.521 --> 00:08:04.700
<v Speaker 3>they did a rap on the Kettlebell with </v>
<v Speaker 3>this approach.</v>

174
00:08:04.701 --> 00:08:06.500
<v Speaker 3>And then drop it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We bought this special,</v>

175
00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:09.590
<v Speaker 3>it's called a strike,</v>
<v Speaker 3>make pet measures impact forces.</v>

176
00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:11.720
<v Speaker 3>And it was scientifically calibrates.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We know,</v>

177
00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:13.340
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this thing works.</v>

178
00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:18.730
<v Speaker 3>And they did repeated thousands of drops</v>
<v Speaker 3>on this and they measured it and it was </v>

179
00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:24.470
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't give the number and tell for </v>

180
00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:24.470
<v Speaker 3>some reason until this study is </v>
<v Speaker 3>published.</v>

181
00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:27.710
<v Speaker 3>But it was a tremendous decrease.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even with a 50 pound Kettlebell,</v>

182
00:08:27.711 --> 00:08:30.740
<v Speaker 3>it decreased the force of that </v>
<v Speaker 3>Kettlebell onto the pad.</v>

183
00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:35.540
<v Speaker 2>So the issue with brain trauma is not </v>
<v Speaker 2>just the impact,</v>

184
00:08:35.541 --> 00:08:38.060
<v Speaker 2>but the amount that it forces the head </v>
<v Speaker 2>back,</v>

185
00:08:38.061 --> 00:08:39.230
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The snap of the head.</v>

186
00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:40.830
<v Speaker 3>That's an issue of it to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get here,</v>

187
00:08:40.831 --> 00:08:43.770
<v Speaker 3>your brain slams into the back of your </v>
<v Speaker 3>head and then comes back again.</v>

188
00:08:43.950 --> 00:08:46.690
<v Speaker 3>Do you think that that would be reduced?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't that.</v>

189
00:08:46.691 --> 00:08:51.691
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's going to change,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're going to have more </v>

190
00:08:51.691 --> 00:08:54.891
<v Speaker 3>absorption,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you have to look at a couple of </v>

191
00:08:54.891 --> 00:08:54.891
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the basic physics equation.</v>

192
00:08:54.891 --> 00:08:55.920
<v Speaker 3>The force of something equals the mass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How big it is times acceleration,</v>

193
00:08:55.921 --> 00:08:56.040
<v Speaker 3>how</v>

194
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:58.770
<v Speaker 2>fast it's moving this way is a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 2>grams,</v>

195
00:08:58.771 --> 00:09:00.880
<v Speaker 2>so it doesn't increase the mass at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right there.</v>

196
00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:03.360
<v Speaker 2>You have a big thick pad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's still four ounces.</v>

197
00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:06.450
<v Speaker 2>Just like an MMA glove that you compete,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

198
00:09:06.451 --> 00:09:06.900
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

199
00:09:06.901 --> 00:09:08.560
<v Speaker 2>I think our gloves way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>4.5</v>

200
00:09:08.561 --> 00:09:09.840
<v Speaker 2>ounces,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these wraps,</v>

201
00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:13.110
<v Speaker 2>they're very standard hundred daily and </v>
<v Speaker 2>traps as well.</v>

202
00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:18.520
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the pad itself doesn't mean you can </v>

203
00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:18.520
<v Speaker 2>feel it doesn't play anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

204
00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:20.330
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is like,</v>

205
00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:25.340
<v Speaker 2>they keep coming up with new material in</v>
<v Speaker 2>or new ways to formulate material that </v>

206
00:09:25.951 --> 00:09:28.410
<v Speaker 2>makes for things like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is fascinating to me.</v>

207
00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:30.420
<v Speaker 2>That's a closed cell foam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's,</v>

208
00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:32.520
<v Speaker 2>I mean you can put it in the Washer and </v>
<v Speaker 2>dryer,</v>

209
00:09:32.521 --> 00:09:33.380
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

210
00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:38.790
<v Speaker 2>bacteria can't grow anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So w we tested it and we also found that</v>

211
00:09:38.791 --> 00:09:41.550
<v Speaker 2>it reduces,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you punch being you're wearing that,</v>

212
00:09:41.551 --> 00:09:43.530
<v Speaker 2>it's less forced to my brain as well.</v>

213
00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:46.300
<v Speaker 2>And the reason why that is another </v>
<v Speaker 2>equation,</v>

214
00:09:46.301 --> 00:09:49.980
<v Speaker 2>you have to look at it as the pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you throw a punch and a slap,</v>

215
00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:55.160
<v Speaker 2>the force is exactly the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it's the same arc and the same </v>

216
00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:58.311
<v Speaker 2>strike.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The difference why it punches more </v>

217
00:09:58.311 --> 00:10:01.041
<v Speaker 2>devastating is because that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that force is condensed into a smaller </v>

218
00:10:01.041 --> 00:10:01.170
<v Speaker 2>area,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on a punch with a slap.</v>

219
00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:06.440
<v Speaker 2>It's spread out over a wider area.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you could fish slapped by someone </v>

220
00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:06.440
<v Speaker 2>with a little hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it probably hurts more.</v>

221
00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:09.020
<v Speaker 2>Now I'm going to assume that fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>room,</v>

222
00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:16.030
<v Speaker 2>that's why it hurts more when girls </v>
<v Speaker 2>bitch slap you because it hurts your </v>

223
00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:16.030
<v Speaker 2>pride to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>

224
00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:18.960
<v Speaker 2>So this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this approach,</v>

225
00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:21.070
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you think that this is.</v>

226
00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:23.880
<v Speaker 2>The problem with it in competition is </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're too,</v>

227
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.130
<v Speaker 2>they're too big.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a train in glove competitions,</v>

228
00:10:26.131 --> 00:10:27.810
<v Speaker 2>all different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But most people don't compete,</v>

229
00:10:28.050 --> 00:10:31.230
<v Speaker 2>but these are not that much bigger than </v>
<v Speaker 2>the ones that were in pride.</v>

230
00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:33.520
<v Speaker 2>Like the problems are pretty good at </v>
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>

231
00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:37.530
<v Speaker 2>That it also makes it more difficult to </v>
<v Speaker 2>extend your fingers.</v>

232
00:10:37.531 --> 00:10:40.080
<v Speaker 2>So we'll help with ipos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

233
00:10:40.081 --> 00:10:41.520
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a big one man.</v>

234
00:10:41.521 --> 00:10:45.150
<v Speaker 2>And that was another thing that pride to</v>
<v Speaker 2>dress better than the UFC because it was</v>

235
00:10:45.151 --> 00:10:47.220
<v Speaker 2>very rarely were there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I pokes and pride.</v>

236
00:10:47.830 --> 00:10:52.830
<v Speaker 2>I've been really kind of studying this I</v>
<v Speaker 2>poke thing a lot over the past few </v>

237
00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:53.940
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's that,</v>

238
00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:55.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that old cliche,</v>

239
00:10:55.261 --> 00:11:00.261
<v Speaker 2>the definition of insanity is doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>something over and over again the exact </v>

240
00:11:00.261 --> 00:11:00.261
<v Speaker 2>same way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hoping for different result.</v>

241
00:11:00.261 --> 00:11:01.860
<v Speaker 2>That's sort of what we're doing with </v>
<v Speaker 2>this ipad thing.</v>

242
00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:03.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean every goddamn fight there's like,</v>

243
00:11:03.781 --> 00:11:06.480
<v Speaker 2>look at the last Aldo Mendez fight was </v>
<v Speaker 2>like two,</v>

244
00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:11.370
<v Speaker 2>at least two ipos right there where they</v>
<v Speaker 2>stop the action back off.</v>

245
00:11:11.371 --> 00:11:16.371
<v Speaker 2>Like that's crazy that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that to me it's crazy that you're high </v>

246
00:11:16.371 --> 00:11:16.860
<v Speaker 2>level competition guys.</v>

247
00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:21.860
<v Speaker 2>Not Cheating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just they're just doing what </v>

248
00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:22.970
<v Speaker 2>happens in a fight normally in guys are </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting poked in the eye.</v>

249
00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:28.040
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many more guys have to get like a </v>

250
00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:30.080
<v Speaker 2>Michael Bisping type injury where </v>
<v Speaker 2>Michael Bisping has one crazy fucking </v>

251
00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:30.570
<v Speaker 2>lie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He trains with us now.</v>

252
00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:31.710
<v Speaker 2>Does he?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

253
00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:34.260
<v Speaker 2>he's high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That one eye is not good.</v>

254
00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:37.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't seem to affect them in train,</v>

255
00:11:37.351 --> 00:11:39.150
<v Speaker 2>but it looks a little funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a fucking animal.</v>

256
00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:41.340
<v Speaker 2>Michael Bisping is just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have say,</v>

257
00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:45.120
<v Speaker 2>I have never met anyone who wants to win</v>
<v Speaker 2>more than Michael Bisping.</v>

258
00:11:45.210 --> 00:11:47.760
<v Speaker 2>He's a fucking animal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wants to win every training session.</v>

259
00:11:47.761 --> 00:11:49.440
<v Speaker 2>Every go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every situation.</v>

260
00:11:49.441 --> 00:11:54.441
<v Speaker 2>That guy is a winner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a fucking animal and he doesn't </v>

261
00:11:54.441 --> 00:11:57.910
<v Speaker 2>have like a extreme athletic talent or </v>
<v Speaker 2>extreme physical gifts.</v>

262
00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:03.240
<v Speaker 2>It's just cardiovascular training.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Discipline will toughness.</v>

263
00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:09.210
<v Speaker 2>He's got all these other things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like you look at a guy like Jon </v>

264
00:12:09.210 --> 00:12:09.670
<v Speaker 2>Jones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just incredible physical talent.</v>

265
00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:14.940
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you look at a guy like I'm Hector </v>

266
00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:15.520
<v Speaker 2>Lombard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous physical talent on top of the</v>

267
00:12:15.521 --> 00:12:16.450
<v Speaker 2>discipline,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all that stuff.</v>

268
00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:21.670
<v Speaker 2>Bisbing just a normal guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a normal guy who's tough as shit.</v>

269
00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:24.520
<v Speaker 2>Tough as shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't get enough credit.</v>

270
00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:26.440
<v Speaker 2>I really don't think he gets nearly </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough credit.</v>

271
00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:30.240
<v Speaker 2>The guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these last two have been very juice hop,</v>

272
00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:31.350
<v Speaker 2>top high level guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

273
00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:35.110
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'd probably.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tim Kennedy.</v>

274
00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:37.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tim Kennedy was a clean,</v>

275
00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:42.300
<v Speaker 2>clean as a whistle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but everybody else essentially was on </v>

276
00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:42.300
<v Speaker 2>something that you can't do anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

277
00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:45.430
<v Speaker 2>What I like about him is grit and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they've found that grit is a much better</v>

278
00:12:45.431 --> 00:12:50.431
<v Speaker 2>predictor of success than I queue is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so when you find someone who really </v>

279
00:12:50.651 --> 00:12:55.651
<v Speaker 2>wants something and they're willing to </v>
<v Speaker 2>suffer and keep going and fail and get </v>

280
00:12:55.651 --> 00:12:59.791
<v Speaker 2>up again and fail and get up again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the guy that you got to put your </v>

281
00:12:59.791 --> 00:13:00.100
<v Speaker 2>money on visiting does that better than </v>
<v Speaker 2>anyone.</v>

282
00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:05.430
<v Speaker 2>He certainly does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it him against a guy like Anderson </v>

283
00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:07.120
<v Speaker 2>Silva and his prime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know that,</v>

284
00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:12.330
<v Speaker 2>that that's like this crossover,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this like we're the land of grit meets </v>

285
00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:17.610
<v Speaker 2>extreme talent and confidence and just </v>
<v Speaker 2>that rare quality that the goats possess</v>

286
00:13:20.050 --> 00:13:22.260
<v Speaker 2>the greatest of all times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Guys that,</v>

287
00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:26.710
<v Speaker 2>that rare thing that Anderson had for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>few years in his prime.</v>

288
00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:30.550
<v Speaker 2>It seems like Weidman's kind of stolen </v>
<v Speaker 2>that from him pretty.</v>

289
00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:33.940
<v Speaker 2>Which is a shame too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he was so dominant for so long.</v>

290
00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:36.130
<v Speaker 2>No shame.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Beautiful.</v>

291
00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:37.590
<v Speaker 2>It's the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't mean that.</v>

292
00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:42.600
<v Speaker 2>I mean if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if people don't think as highly of </v>

293
00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:44.050
<v Speaker 2>Anderson Silva because he lost and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>would be a shame.</v>

294
00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:45.730
<v Speaker 2>I don't see that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't see that.</v>

295
00:13:45.731 --> 00:13:46.870
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

296
00:13:46.871 --> 00:13:49.510
<v Speaker 2>Weidman was the right guy at the right </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

297
00:13:49.511 --> 00:13:51.430
<v Speaker 2>And that's the beautiful thing about the</v>
<v Speaker 2>sport.</v>

298
00:13:51.431 --> 00:13:52.180
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

299
00:13:52.210 --> 00:13:55.770
<v Speaker 2>new guys come along and then Weidman </v>
<v Speaker 2>becomes that guy and Weidman,</v>

300
00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:56.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he'd beat Leo.</v>

301
00:13:56.950 --> 00:13:57.990
<v Speaker 2>Machida,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

302
00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:00.700
<v Speaker 2>he's a fucking savage man at </v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>

303
00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:05.730
<v Speaker 2>That guy's a tank.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just a goddamn iron willed steel </v>

304
00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:10.030
<v Speaker 2>jawed knockout machine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a fucking high caliber for time.</v>

305
00:14:10.031 --> 00:14:15.031
<v Speaker 2>Division One,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all American wrestler that wants to </v>

306
00:14:15.031 --> 00:14:16.240
<v Speaker 2>steal your soul once again on top of you</v>
<v Speaker 2>and punch through your fucking your bone</v>

307
00:14:16.241 --> 00:14:19.630
<v Speaker 2>structure until he get out your soul.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just Yank it out of your body.</v>

308
00:14:19.631 --> 00:14:24.631
<v Speaker 2>And when.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's always going to be those </v>

309
00:14:24.631 --> 00:14:24.631
<v Speaker 2>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

310
00:14:24.631 --> 00:14:27.820
<v Speaker 2>like a nature documentary that the big </v>
<v Speaker 2>male lion at some point is driven off </v>

311
00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:28.480
<v Speaker 2>of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone new comes along.</v>

312
00:14:28.481 --> 00:14:30.020
<v Speaker 2>It's going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

313
00:14:30.021 --> 00:14:34.000
<v Speaker 2>Anderson's 39 now and he just signed a </v>
<v Speaker 2>15 fight deal.</v>

314
00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:37.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How crazy is he at 39?</v>

315
00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:38.650
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just for fun.</v>

316
00:14:39.370 --> 00:14:41.590
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe he's going to do all 15 fights.</v>

317
00:14:41.591 --> 00:14:43.330
<v Speaker 2>I mean he would have to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's.</v>

318
00:14:43.331 --> 00:14:45.070
<v Speaker 2>So Ronnie probably fights the most of </v>
<v Speaker 2>anybody,</v>

319
00:14:45.071 --> 00:14:45.370
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

320
00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:47.080
<v Speaker 2>Probably fights about five times a year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

321
00:14:47.081 --> 00:14:49.630
<v Speaker 2>Neil magnifique six times last year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did he really?</v>

322
00:14:49.690 --> 00:14:50.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

323
00:14:50.501 --> 00:14:53.200
<v Speaker 2>Neil's I started was trying to fight a </v>
<v Speaker 2>six time.</v>

324
00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:55.850
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's say six times.</v>

325
00:14:55.890 --> 00:14:57.230
<v Speaker 2>Probably the most.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty extreme.</v>

326
00:14:57.231 --> 00:15:00.110
<v Speaker 2>Every two months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the most anybody does,</v>

327
00:15:00.111 --> 00:15:01.660
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pretty much for a headliner there.</v>

328
00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:06.670
<v Speaker 2>You gotta figure it's every year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe three times a year if you're </v>

329
00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:06.670
<v Speaker 2>really lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if he.</v>

330
00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:07.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's true.</v>

331
00:15:07.041 --> 00:15:08.300
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you've got to sell it.</v>

332
00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:10.430
<v Speaker 2>It's not only magnesium.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The undercard is like,</v>

333
00:15:10.431 --> 00:15:12.530
<v Speaker 2>people look forward to seeing them fight</v>
<v Speaker 2>good fighter,</v>

334
00:15:12.890 --> 00:15:16.670
<v Speaker 2>but it's not like people are like </v>
<v Speaker 2>shelling out pay per view dollars to see</v>

335
00:15:16.671 --> 00:15:20.450
<v Speaker 2>a guy who's relatively unknown except </v>
<v Speaker 2>regards hardcore guys like you or me who</v>

336
00:15:20.451 --> 00:15:25.451
<v Speaker 2>really know about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a guy like Anderson selling pay per </v>

337
00:15:25.451 --> 00:15:25.451
<v Speaker 2>view,</v>
<v Speaker 2>selling cards,</v>

338
00:15:25.451 --> 00:15:30.070
<v Speaker 2>headline Fox,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he probably can't fight but three times </v>

339
00:15:30.070 --> 00:15:32.201
<v Speaker 2>a year Max realty especially talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about age and then preparation.</v>

340
00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:37.840
<v Speaker 2>It's going to take him three months to </v>
<v Speaker 2>prepare because that's how he's used to </v>

341
00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:42.120
<v Speaker 2>been doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're young and you're just getting </v>

342
00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:42.120
<v Speaker 2>started,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can go fight more,</v>

343
00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:45.251
<v Speaker 2>but once you get older you kind of need </v>
<v Speaker 2>that time and then you've had that </v>

344
00:15:45.251 --> 00:15:48.551
<v Speaker 2>experience of longer fight camps and </v>
<v Speaker 2>better preparation and so what do you </v>

345
00:15:48.551 --> 00:15:50.510
<v Speaker 2>think the 15 fight deal just to keep </v>
<v Speaker 2>them from going to bell door.</v>

346
00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:54.020
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine that was on Anderson's </v>
<v Speaker 2>end.</v>

347
00:15:54.021 --> 00:15:59.021
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I wonder because he had a deal and </v>

348
00:15:59.021 --> 00:16:01.210
<v Speaker 2>then when they were back in Rio for this</v>
<v Speaker 2>past UFC,</v>

349
00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:02.990
<v Speaker 2>although Mendez fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they resigned them.</v>

350
00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:06.740
<v Speaker 2>They throw out the old deal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>resigned them to 15 fight deal.</v>

351
00:16:07.190 --> 00:16:09.910
<v Speaker 2>He's done everything there is to deal </v>
<v Speaker 2>helping assist with I.</v>

352
00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:12.920
<v Speaker 2>He's one of the greatest ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was the greatest ever,</v>

353
00:16:12.970 --> 00:16:16.670
<v Speaker 2>I think for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the argument can be made,</v>

354
00:16:16.671 --> 00:16:17.900
<v Speaker 2>especially now that he's lost.</v>

355
00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:23.320
<v Speaker 2>The argument can be made for fader.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those the only two guys I think that </v>

356
00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:25.940
<v Speaker 2>fall into the greatest ever faders tough</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing is he never fought in the UFC.</v>

357
00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:28.640
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the one strike against them.</v>

358
00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:32.690
<v Speaker 2>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way he lost two big foot and the way</v>

359
00:16:32.691 --> 00:16:37.130
<v Speaker 2>he lost his doom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like an Henderson Henderson.</v>

360
00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:38.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a big one too,</v>

361
00:16:38.931 --> 00:16:43.931
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was kind of a different guy by that </v>

362
00:16:43.931 --> 00:16:43.931
<v Speaker 2>time though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

363
00:16:43.931 --> 00:16:44.780
<v Speaker 2>I think you'd already sort of checked </v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

364
00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:50.110
<v Speaker 2>His body looked way different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like go back and watch the Food G to </v>

365
00:16:50.110 --> 00:16:50.510
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When he fought Fujita,</v>

366
00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:53.030
<v Speaker 2>who's fucking rocked?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was swole.</v>

367
00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:55.100
<v Speaker 2>He still had that big Russian beer </v>
<v Speaker 2>belly,</v>

368
00:16:55.510 --> 00:16:58.340
<v Speaker 2>but he was swole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was a big thick.</v>

369
00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:01.070
<v Speaker 2>We shared locker rooms with him and </v>
<v Speaker 2>pride before.</v>

370
00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:02.120
<v Speaker 2>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

371
00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:04.070
<v Speaker 2>How does he prepare?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does he want?</v>

372
00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:05.120
<v Speaker 2>What's his warm up like?</v>

373
00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:09.470
<v Speaker 2>They're always pretty mellow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have watched the warm up with him.</v>

374
00:17:09.471 --> 00:17:11.540
<v Speaker 2>We were always,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for whatever reason,</v>

375
00:17:11.541 --> 00:17:16.541
<v Speaker 2>it didn't turn out like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but sometimes you pay attention to the </v>

376
00:17:16.541 --> 00:17:19.451
<v Speaker 2>warm up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes you'd done just depends where </v>

377
00:17:19.451 --> 00:17:21.021
<v Speaker 2>you fall in the card.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that I really love </v>

378
00:17:21.021 --> 00:17:23.621
<v Speaker 2>about BMA is that there's guys like you </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are out there that really aren't </v>

379
00:17:24.170 --> 00:17:26.540
<v Speaker 2>almost forced to innovate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

380
00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:27.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

381
00:17:27.711 --> 00:17:32.711
<v Speaker 2>this is not a sport like football or </v>
<v Speaker 2>basketball where there's established </v>

382
00:17:32.931 --> 00:17:37.931
<v Speaker 2>training protocols and everybody sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>knows the exact right way to go about </v>

383
00:17:37.931 --> 00:17:37.931
<v Speaker 2>doing things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

384
00:17:37.931 --> 00:17:39.680
<v Speaker 2>it's like guys like you who are going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

385
00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:44.760
<v Speaker 2>what if there was no training protocols,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they had to be started.</v>

386
00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:50.750
<v Speaker 2>Some someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they thought they were insulted </v>

387
00:17:50.750 --> 00:17:50.750
<v Speaker 2>me when it said Ryan is always trying to</v>
<v Speaker 2>make everything better.</v>

388
00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:53.760
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly it.</v>

389
00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:55.790
<v Speaker 2>That's the greatest compliment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're in.</v>

390
00:17:55.791 --> 00:18:00.791
<v Speaker 2>Salt was a great compliment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When people think that for some reason </v>

391
00:18:00.791 --> 00:18:01.170
<v Speaker 2>everything's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just work hard.</v>

392
00:18:01.290 --> 00:18:03.150
<v Speaker 2>Everything is fine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but no,</v>

393
00:18:03.151 --> 00:18:03.610
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

394
00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:06.690
<v Speaker 2>there's all sorts of ways to do things </v>
<v Speaker 2>the right way.</v>

395
00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:11.160
<v Speaker 2>Will w I wrote the first team quest </v>
<v Speaker 2>training manual 14 years ago,</v>

396
00:18:11.670 --> 00:18:16.670
<v Speaker 2>so it's been a long time thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>the progress and how you train for </v>

397
00:18:16.670 --> 00:18:20.001
<v Speaker 2>sports now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's been an evolution of the </v>

398
00:18:20.001 --> 00:18:21.501
<v Speaker 2>technical side of things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In the beginning technique you had to </v>

399
00:18:21.501 --> 00:18:25.641
<v Speaker 2>know the technique.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you had never seen an arm bar before </v>

400
00:18:25.641 --> 00:18:26.790
<v Speaker 2>or didn't hide to a double leg,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the what became very important.</v>

401
00:18:26.850 --> 00:18:27.730
<v Speaker 2>What W,</v>
<v Speaker 2>W,</v>

402
00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:29.760
<v Speaker 2>what techniques do I feel?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you defend this?</v>

403
00:18:29.761 --> 00:18:31.830
<v Speaker 2>If you don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then all of a sudden,</v>

404
00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:33.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I met Art Jimson the other day.</v>

405
00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:36.590
<v Speaker 2>I met rob.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I met art at one of the recent UFC.</v>

406
00:18:36.670 --> 00:18:38.570
<v Speaker 2>He seemed with his glove.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He brought that one.</v>

407
00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:41.370
<v Speaker 2>He gave me a glove and that's really </v>
<v Speaker 2>nice guy,</v>

408
00:18:41.610 --> 00:18:45.180
<v Speaker 2>but he just had never even seen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you don't know that that can exist,</v>

409
00:18:45.181 --> 00:18:48.480
<v Speaker 2>you have to figure out the what now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the what is everywhere.</v>

410
00:18:48.481 --> 00:18:53.481
<v Speaker 2>I can have Marcella Garcia teach me how </v>
<v Speaker 2>to choke someone on Youtube in two </v>

411
00:18:53.481 --> 00:18:53.820
<v Speaker 2>minutes and does this cost me any money?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

412
00:18:53.821 --> 00:18:54.410
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I want,</v>

413
00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:59.420
<v Speaker 2>I can save up a little bit of money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can go to New York and I can probably </v>

414
00:18:59.420 --> 00:18:59.420
<v Speaker 2>do a private with him for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

415
00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:00.450
<v Speaker 2>couple hundred bucks or something like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

416
00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:01.530
<v Speaker 2>Whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is,</v>

417
00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:03.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's so many people,</v>

418
00:19:03.601 --> 00:19:06.150
<v Speaker 2>there's so many people who can teach me </v>
<v Speaker 2>how to have a box,</v>

419
00:19:06.151 --> 00:19:09.540
<v Speaker 2>how to kickbox everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the what isn't important anymore.</v>

420
00:19:09.541 --> 00:19:12.630
<v Speaker 2>Now it's why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why are you doing what you're doing?</v>

421
00:19:13.530 --> 00:19:16.470
<v Speaker 2>So that's what I spend most of my </v>
<v Speaker 2>timeline.</v>

422
00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:21.500
<v Speaker 2>We've changed the nature of how we </v>
<v Speaker 2>structure training camps and nature of </v>

423
00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:24.740
<v Speaker 2>how we train for each fight has to </v>
<v Speaker 2>adjust and change a little bit because </v>

424
00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:26.280
<v Speaker 2>every fight is different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know where the what is still sort of</v>

425
00:19:26.281 --> 00:19:31.281
<v Speaker 2>like ambiguous or missing is in </v>
<v Speaker 2>traditional karate techniques or </v>

426
00:19:31.281 --> 00:19:35.630
<v Speaker 2>traditional taekwondo techniques.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like a lot of people are doing a lot of </v>

427
00:19:35.630 --> 00:19:38.811
<v Speaker 2>those wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Still like high level guys still throw </v>

428
00:19:38.811 --> 00:19:39.750
<v Speaker 2>bad spinning back ticks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They still throw bad.</v>

429
00:19:39.751 --> 00:19:44.751
<v Speaker 2>We'll kicks like high level guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then some guys pick it up while </v>

430
00:19:44.751 --> 00:19:48.490
<v Speaker 2>you're [inaudible] fucking 37 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of a sudden he's got a we'll kick </v>

431
00:19:48.490 --> 00:19:49.890
<v Speaker 2>out of nowhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We fight rockhold.</v>

432
00:19:49.891 --> 00:19:50.990
<v Speaker 2>He hits him in the head with a we'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>kick.</v>

433
00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:53.610
<v Speaker 2>It's never even fucking thrown a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll check before he throws one.</v>

434
00:19:53.611 --> 00:19:57.780
<v Speaker 2>We'll kick earlier in that round misses </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then throws the second one,</v>

435
00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:02.220
<v Speaker 2>clocks rockhold and finishes them off </v>
<v Speaker 2>from the ground like what the fuck.</v>

436
00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:06.570
<v Speaker 2>And you know where a lot of detours </v>
<v Speaker 2>kicking is coming from brittle hands.</v>

437
00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:12.310
<v Speaker 2>You a lot of his kickings coming from VV</v>
<v Speaker 2>tours had more than seven surgeries on </v>

438
00:20:12.310 --> 00:20:14.220
<v Speaker 2>his hands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's always breaking his hands.</v>

439
00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:18.120
<v Speaker 2>So he started to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like forced himself.</v>

440
00:20:18.450 --> 00:20:23.450
<v Speaker 2>Like when he fought Jon Jones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had a fucked up hand going into that </v>

441
00:20:23.450 --> 00:20:23.450
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

442
00:20:23.450 --> 00:20:28.170
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd spoken with him in Brazil just maybe</v>

443
00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:31.770
<v Speaker 2>a few months before that and he had a </v>
<v Speaker 2>pin in his hand.</v>

444
00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:36.600
<v Speaker 2>So a few months before fighting for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>light heavyweight title against arguably</v>

445
00:20:36.601 --> 00:20:39.270
<v Speaker 2>the greatest light heavyweight ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got a fucking broken hand,</v>

446
00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:42.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he started developing his kicks a lot</v>

447
00:20:42.901 --> 00:20:47.901
<v Speaker 2>more and that's where you started </v>
<v Speaker 2>knocked out being with a head kick </v>

448
00:20:47.901 --> 00:20:48.100
<v Speaker 2>fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Henderson with the head kicks,</v>

449
00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:51.250
<v Speaker 1>head kicks were not a part of his </v>
<v Speaker 1>repertoire in the early days.</v>

450
00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:56.460
<v Speaker 1>It was all wide stance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stand your ground floor blitzkrieg with </v>

451
00:20:56.460 --> 00:21:01.291
<v Speaker 1>those boxing punches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's forced to adapt and forced to for </v>

452
00:21:01.291 --> 00:21:05.730
<v Speaker 1>forced to learn and grow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when it comes to like across the </v>

453
00:21:05.730 --> 00:21:05.730
<v Speaker 1>board,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you got,</v>

454
00:21:05.950 --> 00:21:09.670
<v Speaker 1>if we took everybody in the UFC roster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a 400 plus guys,</v>

455
00:21:09.671 --> 00:21:14.671
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we brought him into the room and I </v>

456
00:21:14.671 --> 00:21:16.291
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>show me how you'd throw a spinning back </v>

457
00:21:16.291 --> 00:21:16.291
<v Speaker 1>kick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>show me how you throw.</v>

458
00:21:16.291 --> 00:21:17.140
<v Speaker 1>We'll kick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>1% of them would be doing it right.</v>

459
00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:18.700
<v Speaker 1>Maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe 1%.</v>

460
00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:21.460
<v Speaker 1>Show me how to throw a right hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hundred percent would do it right.</v>

461
00:21:21.670 --> 00:21:23.830
<v Speaker 1>Show me how to throw a left hook.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just two variations.</v>

462
00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:25.810
<v Speaker 1>They would all be doing it right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

463
00:21:25.811 --> 00:21:27.370
<v Speaker 1>either it's not hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

464
00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:29.460
<v Speaker 1>a knuckles up or knuckles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

465
00:21:29.461 --> 00:21:32.080
<v Speaker 1>across either one is fine.</v>

466
00:21:32.230 --> 00:21:35.020
<v Speaker 1>Both of them are effective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a lot of techniques that are</v>

467
00:21:35.021 --> 00:21:38.290
<v Speaker 1>still missing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot because flexibility,</v>

468
00:21:38.291 --> 00:21:42.100
<v Speaker 1>dexterity with the legs and having those</v>
<v Speaker 1>abilities.</v>

469
00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:44.380
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the next level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>

470
00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:49.560
<v Speaker 1>And you're seeing guys like conor </v>
<v Speaker 1>mcgregor who's coming along who throws </v>

471
00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:52.000
<v Speaker 1>all these wild kicking techniques that a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of guys just don't.</v>

472
00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:53.890
<v Speaker 1>They just don't have in their </v>
<v Speaker 1>repertoire.</v>

473
00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:59.040
<v Speaker 1>They're straight Moy Tai.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you've got the Moitai end that I </v>

474
00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:01.180
<v Speaker 1>think that's next level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's always room to improve,</v>

475
00:22:01.181 --> 00:22:01.790
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

476
00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:03.600
<v Speaker 1>And were forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They will be.</v>

477
00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:08.640
<v Speaker 1>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the biggest area of improvement that </v>

478
00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:10.051
<v Speaker 1>people haven't really caught onto is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>cage yet using the cage really using the</v>

479
00:22:10.061 --> 00:22:13.180
<v Speaker 1>cage because the dynamics of fighting on</v>
<v Speaker 1>a cage are totally different.</v>

480
00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:18.500
<v Speaker 1>And I would say over the past four years</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've had this kind of group around </v>

481
00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:19.000
<v Speaker 1>rain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pat was there,</v>

482
00:22:19.450 --> 00:22:21.220
<v Speaker 1>I was there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mark Munoz,</v>

483
00:22:21.221 --> 00:22:22.660
<v Speaker 1>Bob Ballou contributed a little bit.</v>

484
00:22:22.690 --> 00:22:24.820
<v Speaker 1>Dan Henderson contribute a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>like this,</v>

485
00:22:25.170 --> 00:22:30.170
<v Speaker 1>this whole approach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a systematic approach to fight in the </v>

486
00:22:30.170 --> 00:22:32.851
<v Speaker 1>cage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kind of came out through this whole </v>

487
00:22:32.851 --> 00:22:32.851
<v Speaker 1>development process is really </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting and fun to be a part of.</v>

488
00:22:32.851 --> 00:22:35.890
<v Speaker 1>But that's an area that I see a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys just still not.</v>

489
00:22:36.550 --> 00:22:39.700
<v Speaker 1>Here's the basic thing I have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I watched fights with the notebook,</v>

490
00:22:39.701 --> 00:22:44.701
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So every time I have new drills that </v>

491
00:22:44.701 --> 00:22:44.701
<v Speaker 1>come out of every every card that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>watch,</v>

492
00:22:44.701 --> 00:22:47.350
<v Speaker 1>and I noticed that when someone tries to</v>
<v Speaker 1>shoot a double leg,</v>

493
00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:50.020
<v Speaker 1>the first thing you do is you turn </v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

494
00:22:50.021 --> 00:22:55.021
<v Speaker 1>you turn your hips.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So your feet are now parallel to the </v>

495
00:22:55.021 --> 00:22:55.021
<v Speaker 1>cage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mm hmm.</v>

496
00:22:55.021 --> 00:22:59.070
<v Speaker 1>I would watch probably 200 fights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw one person finished a double leg </v>

497
00:22:59.070 --> 00:23:00.940
<v Speaker 1>when their feet had turned to a parallel</v>
<v Speaker 1>position to the cage.</v>

498
00:23:01.570 --> 00:23:02.890
<v Speaker 1>Guys would still hang on to it.</v>

499
00:23:02.890 --> 00:23:05.560
<v Speaker 1>They'd get their head pushed down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they get elbowed in that position.</v>

500
00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:07.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm Travis Browne,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Travis Browne.</v>

501
00:23:07.241 --> 00:23:12.241
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They hang onto this double when he's </v>

502
00:23:12.241 --> 00:23:12.241
<v Speaker 1>turned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you now know visually,</v>

503
00:23:12.241 --> 00:23:12.580
<v Speaker 1>if you know anything you think about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in a fight.</v>

504
00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:18.000
<v Speaker 1>Adrenaline's going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in your double leg and you look </v>

505
00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:18.000
<v Speaker 1>down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're looking at a guy's feet.</v>

506
00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:18.280
<v Speaker 1>If at that point you see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

507
00:23:18.281 --> 00:23:20.280
<v Speaker 1>they're not pointing straight out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no double way.</v>

508
00:23:20.290 --> 00:23:23.800
<v Speaker 1>You can switch to your single shift.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That one little thing right there.</v>

509
00:23:23.830 --> 00:23:28.830
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden you can teach somebody </v>
<v Speaker 1>because one of the first things I have </v>

510
00:23:28.830 --> 00:23:28.830
<v Speaker 1>to do is I have to help someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand,</v>

511
00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:31.330
<v Speaker 1>number one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their part in the overall scheme,</v>

512
00:23:31.331 --> 00:23:34.480
<v Speaker 1>how they fit into the culture and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>current state of Emma,</v>

513
00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:38.230
<v Speaker 1>but also how they deal with every </v>
<v Speaker 1>position in the cage and when they go in</v>

514
00:23:38.231 --> 00:23:43.231
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want them to know that they have a </v>

515
00:23:43.231 --> 00:23:45.091
<v Speaker 1>system for approaching each of those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so by breaking it down and </v>

516
00:23:45.091 --> 00:23:45.091
<v Speaker 1>understanding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

517
00:23:45.091 --> 00:23:46.160
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that one little thing,</v>

518
00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:47.500
<v Speaker 2>if their feet are here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a double leg,</v>

519
00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:48.860
<v Speaker 2>the feeder here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a single leg.</v>

520
00:23:49.110 --> 00:23:51.170
<v Speaker 2>It's a very easy for them for them to </v>
<v Speaker 2>grow on.</v>

521
00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:56.520
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's something that people that don't </v>

522
00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:56.780
<v Speaker 2>really understand Ma and they just sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>of watching a fight.</v>

523
00:23:57.200 --> 00:24:02.200
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they truly appreciate how </v>
<v Speaker 2>much thinking involved and how much </v>

524
00:24:03.111 --> 00:24:07.070
<v Speaker 2>technique and how much it really is this</v>
<v Speaker 2>massive,</v>

525
00:24:07.220 --> 00:24:09.740
<v Speaker 2>complex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nuanced game of strategy.</v>

526
00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:12.740
<v Speaker 2>It's about brute force.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's about kinetic energy.</v>

527
00:24:12.741 --> 00:24:17.741
<v Speaker 2>It's about endurance and will and grit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's also about all those things </v>

528
00:24:17.741 --> 00:24:20.060
<v Speaker 2>applied through discipline and </v>
<v Speaker 2>technique.</v>

529
00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:25.320
<v Speaker 2>It's about positioning and understanding</v>
<v Speaker 2>of knowledge and like this calculated </v>

530
00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:30.250
<v Speaker 2>approach to training and like really </v>
<v Speaker 2>going over every single detail of every </v>

531
00:24:31.101 --> 00:24:36.101
<v Speaker 2>single position.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The challenge comes when you take a guy </v>

532
00:24:36.101 --> 00:24:36.101
<v Speaker 2>and okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're.</v>

533
00:24:36.101 --> 00:24:37.310
<v Speaker 2>Let's say you naturally are a good </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrestler.</v>

534
00:24:37.311 --> 00:24:38.240
<v Speaker 2>He wrestled in college.</v>

535
00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:43.240
<v Speaker 2>You have a long torso and short legs and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd have to then kind of start </v>

536
00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:47.770
<v Speaker 2>steering someone in a direction because </v>
<v Speaker 2>the the inherent problem with training </v>

537
00:24:47.770 --> 00:24:47.990
<v Speaker 2>and I'm going to say is that there's too</v>
<v Speaker 2>much.</v>

538
00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:50.390
<v Speaker 2>I can't lift weights enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't do enough cardio.</v>

539
00:24:50.391 --> 00:24:53.990
<v Speaker 2>I can't do enough to get so I can't box.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can see you have to go and down,</v>

540
00:24:53.991 --> 00:24:58.991
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to not do all of this stuff </v>

541
00:24:58.991 --> 00:25:02.790
<v Speaker 2>and we're going to know that we're not </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to do it because we don't have </v>

542
00:25:02.790 --> 00:25:05.471
<v Speaker 2>time to wait.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is where our focus needs to be and </v>

543
00:25:05.471 --> 00:25:06.290
<v Speaker 2>that's the why part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why are we doing what we're doing?</v>

544
00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:10.010
<v Speaker 2>How do you choose that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then it changes based on the person,</v>

545
00:25:10.011 --> 00:25:11.690
<v Speaker 2>based on injuries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>based on age,</v>

546
00:25:11.691 --> 00:25:14.120
<v Speaker 2>based on opponent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>future opponents,</v>

547
00:25:14.121 --> 00:25:16.520
<v Speaker 2>kind of where you see the trajectory of </v>
<v Speaker 2>their career going,</v>

548
00:25:16.521 --> 00:25:17.000
<v Speaker 2>all this.</v>

549
00:25:17.030 --> 00:25:19.190
<v Speaker 2>You have to be thinking about this stuff</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the process.</v>

550
00:25:19.550 --> 00:25:24.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it seems like that's one of the </v>

551
00:25:24.550 --> 00:25:24.550
<v Speaker 2>things when they always say styles make </v>
<v Speaker 2>fights.</v>

552
00:25:24.550 --> 00:25:27.980
<v Speaker 2>That's where it really comes into play </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you truly can't be the master of</v>

553
00:25:27.981 --> 00:25:29.180
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Impossible.</v>

554
00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:30.730
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anderson Silva,</v>

555
00:25:31.460 --> 00:25:33.290
<v Speaker 2>he had a wrestling match.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chael Sonnen,</v>

556
00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:35.180
<v Speaker 2>Chael sonnen would beat him every </v>
<v Speaker 2>goddamn day of the week.</v>

557
00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:38.710
<v Speaker 2>They'd show up for a year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every God damn time they wrestled.</v>

558
00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:40.340
<v Speaker 2>Channel double them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take them down.</v>

559
00:25:40.370 --> 00:25:45.370
<v Speaker 2>He would.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He would beat him one points every </v>

560
00:25:45.370 --> 00:25:45.370
<v Speaker 2>fucking time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's am amazing at wrestling,</v>

561
00:25:45.370 --> 00:25:48.020
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so some guys you,</v>

562
00:25:48.290 --> 00:25:50.450
<v Speaker 2>you can get away with doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some guys you could take down,</v>

563
00:25:50.451 --> 00:25:51.620
<v Speaker 2>you can ground them out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some guys,</v>

564
00:25:51.621 --> 00:25:56.621
<v Speaker 2>they figured out how to stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They figure out how to move away from </v>

565
00:25:56.621 --> 00:25:56.621
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And some guys they can take you down.</v>

566
00:25:56.621 --> 00:25:58.670
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's a guy like Chael Sonnen </v>
<v Speaker 2>who's gonna run into this.</v>

567
00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:01.250
<v Speaker 2>Who is this Olympic savage has been </v>
<v Speaker 2>training with um,</v>

568
00:26:01.270 --> 00:26:06.270
<v Speaker 2>Dan Henderson or with Daniel cormier and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got a couple World Battles Cup </v>

569
00:26:06.270 --> 00:26:06.620
<v Speaker 2>Olympic medals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

570
00:26:06.890 --> 00:26:09.020
<v Speaker 2>That guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you got in there with Shell,</v>

571
00:26:09.021 --> 00:26:11.930
<v Speaker 2>Shell might find himself on his back and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they might be like,</v>

572
00:26:11.931 --> 00:26:13.040
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good for her though,</v>

573
00:26:13.041 --> 00:26:18.041
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you'll see guys wrestling and </v>

574
00:26:18.041 --> 00:26:20.351
<v Speaker 2>the cage is very different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if times in wrestling that you </v>

575
00:26:20.351 --> 00:26:20.690
<v Speaker 2>would never attack a single leg and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>go around the waist.</v>

576
00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:25.720
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Except if you're on the cage and then </v>

577
00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:25.720
<v Speaker 2>that's the best way to approach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

578
00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:25.890
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And also dependent.</v>

579
00:26:26.730 --> 00:26:29.960
<v Speaker 2>You have a guy like a Yoel Romero,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

580
00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:31.370
<v Speaker 2>Stud.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Awesome.</v>

581
00:26:31.730 --> 00:26:33.570
<v Speaker 2>His,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his hasn't seen a,</v>

582
00:26:33.710 --> 00:26:35.860
<v Speaker 2>showed a whole lot of wrestling in his </v>
<v Speaker 2>fights.</v>

583
00:26:36.490 --> 00:26:41.490
<v Speaker 2>Gets a couple takedowns here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But tomorrow's he ragdolled tavares who </v>

584
00:26:41.490 --> 00:26:44.090
<v Speaker 2>was throwing them around like a pillow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you look at some of these</v>

585
00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:47.520
<v Speaker 1>for a guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he had seven world metals,</v>

586
00:26:47.550 --> 00:26:47.970
<v Speaker 1>metals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>done.</v>

587
00:26:47.971 --> 00:26:50.350
<v Speaker 1>Everything he did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he didn't win May,</v>

588
00:26:50.430 --> 00:26:52.450
<v Speaker 1>maybe that metal was sold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

589
00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:54.690
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was so good,</v>

590
00:26:54.750 --> 00:26:57.390
<v Speaker 1>but brought this up the other day when </v>
<v Speaker 1>he was wrestling,</v>

591
00:26:57.391 --> 00:27:01.470
<v Speaker 1>he was wrestling for minute matches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so can you keep a pace up?</v>

592
00:27:01.471 --> 00:27:06.471
<v Speaker 1>Can you hit [inaudible] take downs?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you do three towns around or four </v>

593
00:27:06.471 --> 00:27:06.900
<v Speaker 1>takedowns around over a period of 15 </v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes.</v>

594
00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:08.730
<v Speaker 1>Most guys can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

595
00:27:08.731 --> 00:27:13.731
<v Speaker 1>it's also the frame that he's used to </v>
<v Speaker 1>carrying around for wrestling is </v>

596
00:27:13.731 --> 00:27:17.360
<v Speaker 1>probably the wrong frame for Emma who </v>
<v Speaker 1>should probably tone it down a little </v>

597
00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:17.360
<v Speaker 1>bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

598
00:27:17.370 --> 00:27:22.370
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a big fog and you look at him when </v>

599
00:27:22.370 --> 00:27:25.431
<v Speaker 1>he steps on the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not the weigh ins because he's a little </v>

600
00:27:25.431 --> 00:27:25.431
<v Speaker 1>dehydrated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when he steps into the octagon,</v>

601
00:27:25.431 --> 00:27:26.700
<v Speaker 1>that fucking guy looks like a cartoon.</v>

602
00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:30.900
<v Speaker 1>I mean his waist is 27 inches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His fucking shoulders a retarded.</v>

603
00:27:30.901 --> 00:27:33.730
<v Speaker 1>Everything is just as bubble muscle </v>
<v Speaker 1>bubble.</v>

604
00:27:33.731 --> 00:27:37.560
<v Speaker 1>Last bubble thighs just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He looks like just a super freak.</v>

605
00:27:37.950 --> 00:27:39.320
<v Speaker 1>Super Freak athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

606
00:27:39.330 --> 00:27:40.540
<v Speaker 1>He's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His.</v>

607
00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:45.640
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he saw his wrestling videos when he was </v>

608
00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:45.640
<v Speaker 1>active.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obscene him.</v>

609
00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:45.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's amazing.</v>

610
00:27:46.290 --> 00:27:51.290
<v Speaker 1>Unbelievable speed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His ability to close the distance is </v>

611
00:27:51.290 --> 00:27:51.720
<v Speaker 1>shocking in mma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

612
00:27:51.721 --> 00:27:56.721
<v Speaker 1>we saw that in the tovaras fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he tovaras move forward and he stepped </v>

613
00:27:56.721 --> 00:27:59.340
<v Speaker 1>in while the virus is moving forward and</v>
<v Speaker 1>blasting him in the face with an elbow,</v>

614
00:27:59.610 --> 00:28:02.730
<v Speaker 1>but it was just like two guys moving at </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely different speeds.</v>

615
00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:07.760
<v Speaker 1>He's the only guy I've seen to an ankle </v>
<v Speaker 1>pick in an MMA fight tour and James </v>

616
00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:08.390
<v Speaker 1>Tony,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was a little saying,</v>

617
00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:10.460
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was where I was a little single way</v>

618
00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:13.920
<v Speaker 1>from did it was a fight in Germany.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He literally was in a fighting stance,</v>

619
00:28:13.921 --> 00:28:17.250
<v Speaker 1>reached down from an outside grip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>grabbed the guy's ankle,</v>

620
00:28:17.490 --> 00:28:19.530
<v Speaker 1>lift it up over his head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the guy hit the mic.</v>

621
00:28:19.610 --> 00:28:22.050
<v Speaker 1>I want to see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy is different.</v>

622
00:28:22.090 --> 00:28:22.830
<v Speaker 1>He's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But again,</v>

623
00:28:22.860 --> 00:28:26.040
<v Speaker 1>you have to look at are we fighting for </v>
<v Speaker 1>25 minutes where we're fighting for in a</v>

624
00:28:26.050 --> 00:28:31.050
<v Speaker 1>foreman in a wrestling match,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there had been some great </v>

625
00:28:31.050 --> 00:28:33.231
<v Speaker 1>wrestlers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing wrestlers who have come into </v>

626
00:28:33.231 --> 00:28:34.950
<v Speaker 1>Emma and completely failed because for </v>
<v Speaker 1>some reason they can't tune it in for 15</v>

627
00:28:34.951 --> 00:28:35.970
<v Speaker 1>minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

628
00:28:35.971 --> 00:28:38.430
<v Speaker 1>who I really wish would have stuck in </v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

629
00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:40.960
<v Speaker 1>but it just wasn't his thing as rule on </v>
<v Speaker 1>gardener.</v>

630
00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:44.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got my management start.</v>

631
00:28:44.461 --> 00:28:49.461
<v Speaker 1>It really unlocked a lot of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My training start with Rulon rulon when </v>

632
00:28:49.461 --> 00:28:51.630
<v Speaker 1>he fought Yoshida.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was his first MMA fight,</v>

633
00:28:51.631 --> 00:28:53.000
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was.</v>

634
00:28:53.001 --> 00:28:55.870
<v Speaker 1>He had never been in a fight before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're in Japan and they were.</v>

635
00:28:56.060 --> 00:29:01.060
<v Speaker 1>Dan fought somebody on October 31st,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they flew him in to Japan to Tokyo in</v>

636
00:29:01.061 --> 00:29:04.500
<v Speaker 1>October 31st and he was fighting exactly</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight weeks later.</v>

637
00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:06.570
<v Speaker 1>December 31st.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was that New Year's eve?</v>

638
00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:11.580
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he didn't show up in California for </v>

639
00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:15.291
<v Speaker 1>16 days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that eight weeks to live when we're </v>

640
00:29:15.291 --> 00:29:15.910
<v Speaker 1>gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two and a half weeks.</v>

641
00:29:15.911 --> 00:29:18.030
<v Speaker 1>I've gotten six weeks left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>six weeks left.</v>

642
00:29:18.210 --> 00:29:21.870
<v Speaker 1>We have travel on Christmas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now let's go down to five weeks and I</v>

643
00:29:21.871 --> 00:29:26.110
<v Speaker 1>think he went out of town 12 days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What he would have.</v>

644
00:29:26.150 --> 00:29:31.150
<v Speaker 1>There's no days left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would have a speaking engagement </v>

645
00:29:31.150 --> 00:29:31.150
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gotta go,</v>

646
00:29:31.150 --> 00:29:31.150
<v Speaker 1>I'll be back tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'd miss a day here.</v>

647
00:29:31.150 --> 00:29:32.820
<v Speaker 1>He missed a day there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's no days.</v>

648
00:29:33.270 --> 00:29:34.920
<v Speaker 1>That's no day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a suit.</v>

649
00:29:34.921 --> 00:29:39.921
<v Speaker 1>It was a real challenge for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's like five days of training or </v>

650
00:29:39.921 --> 00:29:39.921
<v Speaker 1>something crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's more than that,</v>

651
00:29:39.921 --> 00:29:44.790
<v Speaker 1>I forget what it all came out to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it made me kind of refocus myself to</v>

652
00:29:44.921 --> 00:29:45.370
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

653
00:29:45.371 --> 00:29:48.610
<v Speaker 1>we have a limited amount of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's never been in a fight before,</v>

654
00:29:48.910 --> 00:29:50.230
<v Speaker 1>like not on the school ground.</v>

655
00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:51.550
<v Speaker 1>Nothing like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Too Big.</v>

656
00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:53.900
<v Speaker 1>It really are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You gonna stay an eighth grader,</v>

657
00:29:53.901 --> 00:29:56.980
<v Speaker 1>you find Ruan I don't think since </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking heads as big as this table.</v>

658
00:29:57.070 --> 00:29:58.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it kind of had to decide,</v>

659
00:29:58.691 --> 00:30:03.691
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's what we're going to do and then </v>

660
00:30:03.691 --> 00:30:03.691
<v Speaker 1>deal with all the mental side of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anxiety,</v>

661
00:30:03.691 --> 00:30:05.140
<v Speaker 1>have a fight coming up and that's a big </v>
<v Speaker 1>deal.</v>

662
00:30:05.141 --> 00:30:08.320
<v Speaker 1>A lot to work in all that time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was a unique challenge for him,</v>

663
00:30:08.321 --> 00:30:13.321
<v Speaker 1>but I like his striking approach to just</v>
<v Speaker 1>jabbed the fuck out of them to stepped </v>

664
00:30:13.321 --> 00:30:17.290
<v Speaker 1>in and hit him with that goddamn </v>
<v Speaker 1>telephone pole of a hand of it.</v>

665
00:30:17.291 --> 00:30:22.291
<v Speaker 1>It's just junk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like extending a big telephone </v>

666
00:30:22.291 --> 00:30:22.840
<v Speaker 1>poles and funk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We worked on like four things.</v>

667
00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:26.830
<v Speaker 1>The same thing when so could you fought </v>
<v Speaker 1>Nogueira the fight that you saw?</v>

668
00:30:26.831 --> 00:30:28.930
<v Speaker 1>That's what we did over and over for six</v>
<v Speaker 1>weeks.</v>

669
00:30:29.170 --> 00:30:34.170
<v Speaker 1>So when you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you put an athlete in these </v>

670
00:30:34.170 --> 00:30:34.170
<v Speaker 1>situations where they're in over their </v>
<v Speaker 1>head,</v>

671
00:30:34.170 --> 00:30:39.060
<v Speaker 1>you have to get super focused.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That funnel has gotta get totally </v>

672
00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:39.060
<v Speaker 1>narrative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

673
00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:40.690
<v Speaker 1>here's what we're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the only thing you're allowed to</v>

674
00:30:40.691 --> 00:30:45.691
<v Speaker 1>think about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you take care of everything else in </v>

675
00:30:45.691 --> 00:30:45.691
<v Speaker 1>their life so they don't even have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>focus on it,</v>

676
00:30:45.691 --> 00:30:49.590
<v Speaker 1>so then when they come in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you give them their best chance of </v>

677
00:30:49.590 --> 00:30:50.260
<v Speaker 1>winning by doing this one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a different strategy.</v>

678
00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:55.320
<v Speaker 1>And so for Gardner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what were the things you worked on that </v>

679
00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:55.990
<v Speaker 1>job?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Closing the distance.</v>

680
00:30:56.200 --> 00:31:01.200
<v Speaker 1>Don't worry about throwing right hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to throw a punch off the </v>

681
00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:01.390
<v Speaker 1>backhand if you don't have experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Feels very exposed.</v>

682
00:31:01.550 --> 00:31:03.770
<v Speaker 1>Chink comes up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where's my distance?</v>

683
00:31:03.771 --> 00:31:05.560
<v Speaker 1>So behind that job?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

684
00:31:05.561 --> 00:31:09.640
<v Speaker 1>he had probably a hundred pounds on your</v>
<v Speaker 1>cheetah in the clinch position.</v>

685
00:31:09.641 --> 00:31:11.560
<v Speaker 1>I was fairly confident about that.</v>

686
00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:13.330
<v Speaker 1>And then to get on top,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cover his hips,</v>

687
00:31:13.390 --> 00:31:15.220
<v Speaker 1>grab as risk posture up and punch him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

688
00:31:15.221 --> 00:31:16.660
<v Speaker 1>he didn't do a great job with the ground</v>
<v Speaker 1>and pound,</v>

689
00:31:16.661 --> 00:31:21.661
<v Speaker 1>but we keep it very simple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was allowed to wear wrestling shoes </v>

690
00:31:21.661 --> 00:31:21.661
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

691
00:31:21.661 --> 00:31:22.090
<v Speaker 1>Which was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

692
00:31:22.700 --> 00:31:27.700
<v Speaker 1>you get a big guy like that with </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrestling shoes on and grips totally </v>

693
00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:27.700
<v Speaker 1>did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

694
00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:28.720
<v Speaker 1>good luck taking him down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good fucking luck.</v>

695
00:31:29.050 --> 00:31:31.390
<v Speaker 1>Olympic gold medalists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The last guy,</v>

696
00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:33.710
<v Speaker 1>I mean he did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who?</v>

697
00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:38.720
<v Speaker 1>Who the fuck did he beat in the finals </v>
<v Speaker 1>was a weird thing.</v>

698
00:31:38.861 --> 00:31:39.910
<v Speaker 1>Was the grip thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

699
00:31:40.020 --> 00:31:42.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's basically I give it is tied.</v>

700
00:31:42.910 --> 00:31:47.910
<v Speaker 1>One guy gets to lock first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you lock first and you break your </v>

701
00:31:47.910 --> 00:31:47.910
<v Speaker 1>grip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it's over.</v>

702
00:31:47.910 --> 00:31:49.720
<v Speaker 1>You could appoint.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So rule [inaudible] curl on locked.</v>

703
00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:53.590
<v Speaker 1>He broke his grip and that was it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of ridiculous.</v>

704
00:31:53.650 --> 00:31:54.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They call that a point.</v>

705
00:31:54.970 --> 00:31:58.240
<v Speaker 1>That was a fairly recent rule to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't like pitching [inaudible].</v>

706
00:31:58.241 --> 00:32:01.480
<v Speaker 1>That was 14 years in the time in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>timeframe.</v>

707
00:32:01.481 --> 00:32:03.940
<v Speaker 1>They just recently changed the rules to </v>
<v Speaker 1>keep up with wrestling,</v>

708
00:32:04.050 --> 00:32:05.820
<v Speaker 1>so I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The rules always changed a little bit,</v>

709
00:32:05.821 --> 00:32:08.080
<v Speaker 1>but that's not a victory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it is,</v>

710
00:32:08.081 --> 00:32:09.190
<v Speaker 1>but it isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

711
00:32:09.191 --> 00:32:14.191
<v Speaker 1>It's like God damn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially when you're dealing with a </v>

712
00:32:14.191 --> 00:32:16.030
<v Speaker 1>guy who's probably the greatest Russian </v>
<v Speaker 1>heavyweight of all time,</v>

713
00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:17.820
<v Speaker 1>he's probably one of the greatest </v>
<v Speaker 1>athlete.</v>

714
00:32:17.950 --> 00:32:22.950
<v Speaker 1>Olympic athletes have time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He won every world and Olympic </v>

715
00:32:22.950 --> 00:32:25.600
<v Speaker 1>championships for like 13 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He never lost the match.</v>

716
00:32:25.601 --> 00:32:30.601
<v Speaker 1>And international never lost a match in </v>
<v Speaker 1>international competition until he met </v>

717
00:32:30.601 --> 00:32:31.570
<v Speaker 1>Roland in the finals and lost because of</v>
<v Speaker 1>his grip broke.</v>

718
00:32:31.630 --> 00:32:32.590
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing happened.</v>

719
00:32:32.591 --> 00:32:34.510
<v Speaker 1>You didn't get taken down and get throw </v>
<v Speaker 1>into his head.</v>

720
00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:35.530
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those,</v>

721
00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:38.300
<v Speaker 1>there's images of him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's images of Carrillo.</v>

722
00:32:38.370 --> 00:32:40.650
<v Speaker 1>Jamie pull up one of the images of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Karalyn</v>

723
00:32:40.690 --> 00:32:45.690
<v Speaker 2>Andrew Carrillo and there's an image of </v>
<v Speaker 2>him where he's fucking picking someone </v>

724
00:32:45.690 --> 00:32:49.781
<v Speaker 2>up and reverse lynching his teeth and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got this fucking psychotic look in </v>

725
00:32:49.781 --> 00:32:52.070
<v Speaker 2>his eyes and his whole body doesn't even</v>
<v Speaker 2>look real.</v>

726
00:32:52.250 --> 00:32:57.250
<v Speaker 2>I mean in the middle of straining.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like he's got some extra muscles </v>

727
00:32:57.250 --> 00:32:57.250
<v Speaker 2>that like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

728
00:32:57.250 --> 00:33:01.151
<v Speaker 2>when you see the hulk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like in the vendors isn't even real </v>

729
00:33:01.151 --> 00:33:04.121
<v Speaker 2>muscles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he's got muscles that don't belong </v>

730
00:33:04.121 --> 00:33:05.310
<v Speaker 2>in the human body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like extra connections and weird</v>

731
00:33:05.311 --> 00:33:06.020
<v Speaker 2>little,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

732
00:33:06.050 --> 00:33:09.620
<v Speaker 2>like the hulk is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is not just extra muscular.</v>

733
00:33:09.621 --> 00:33:10.970
<v Speaker 2>He's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not a human frame.</v>

734
00:33:11.180 --> 00:33:16.180
<v Speaker 2>That's a totally different frame.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was something about corral and </v>

735
00:33:16.180 --> 00:33:17.300
<v Speaker 2>when he's fucking a supplement program,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

736
00:33:17.390 --> 00:33:19.760
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it probably had to do with a lot</v>

737
00:33:19.761 --> 00:33:21.440
<v Speaker 2>of stuff that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

738
00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:26.420
<v Speaker 2>it's very hard to get a store.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd probably have to go to a scientist</v>

739
00:33:26.780 --> 00:33:28.220
<v Speaker 2>and you probably don't swallow it.</v>

740
00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:33.340
<v Speaker 2>It probably goes in through a needle </v>
<v Speaker 2>into the muscle and just directly into </v>

741
00:33:33.340 --> 00:33:33.470
<v Speaker 2>the muscle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

742
00:33:33.471 --> 00:33:34.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his family,</v>

743
00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:37.160
<v Speaker 2>his parents were small.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His parents were like five,</v>

744
00:33:37.161 --> 00:33:38.420
<v Speaker 2>five and five,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seven.</v>

745
00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:39.650
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

746
00:33:39.660 --> 00:33:44.660
<v Speaker 2>there's a crazy photo from sports </v>
<v Speaker 2>illustrated of Corella and walking with </v>

747
00:33:44.660 --> 00:33:45.050
<v Speaker 2>his parents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's the picture.</v>

748
00:33:45.051 --> 00:33:50.051
<v Speaker 2>Look at that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at that fucking big fucking </v>

749
00:33:50.810 --> 00:33:55.190
<v Speaker 2>fisherman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He think he wanted to win in the 80s.</v>

750
00:33:55.191 --> 00:33:56.310
<v Speaker 2>Dan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dan Henderson,</v>

751
00:33:56.330 --> 00:33:57.980
<v Speaker 2>he sim,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's now that could evolve.</v>

752
00:33:57.990 --> 00:34:01.640
<v Speaker 2>It used to go over to Russia and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>would train with those guys.</v>

753
00:34:01.970 --> 00:34:04.220
<v Speaker 2>So they got so good that they will go </v>
<v Speaker 2>spend.</v>

754
00:34:04.850 --> 00:34:09.850
<v Speaker 2>They've go spend months at a time there </v>
<v Speaker 2>and heath would tell me Kremlin would </v>

755
00:34:09.850 --> 00:34:12.671
<v Speaker 2>sit on the ground under a rope legs and </v>
<v Speaker 2>just arms come up with 300 pounds,</v>

756
00:34:13.310 --> 00:34:15.110
<v Speaker 2>climbing up a rope with no arms up and </v>
<v Speaker 2>down,</v>

757
00:34:15.111 --> 00:34:15.650
<v Speaker 2>up and down.</v>

758
00:34:15.980 --> 00:34:20.690
<v Speaker 2>I'm not surprised he was a freak athlete</v>
<v Speaker 2>is freakishly strong.</v>

759
00:34:20.870 --> 00:34:25.870
<v Speaker 2>So much so that guys would flatten out </v>
<v Speaker 2>on their stomachs to try to keep him </v>

760
00:34:25.870 --> 00:34:30.650
<v Speaker 2>from picking them up and throwing them </v>
<v Speaker 2>on their heads at heavyweight crazy.</v>

761
00:34:31.060 --> 00:34:36.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just take 300 pound guys from a </v>

762
00:34:36.060 --> 00:34:38.261
<v Speaker 2>fully flattened out position and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>would just scoop them up like they were </v>

763
00:34:38.261 --> 00:34:39.410
<v Speaker 2>nothing and just launch them through the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking air.</v>

764
00:34:40.190 --> 00:34:43.650
<v Speaker 2>Only father time beat that guy just </v>
<v Speaker 2>after awhile.</v>

765
00:34:43.790 --> 00:34:48.790
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's running hot for father time and </v>

766
00:34:48.790 --> 00:34:48.790
<v Speaker 2>Rulon Gardner Gardner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

767
00:34:48.790 --> 00:34:50.090
<v Speaker 2>Sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of beat them.</v>

768
00:34:50.270 --> 00:34:55.270
<v Speaker 2>I mean tactically beat him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It didn't beat him like he beat </v>

769
00:34:55.270 --> 00:34:55.270
<v Speaker 2>everybody else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but gardener.</v>

770
00:34:55.270 --> 00:34:55.940
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

771
00:34:55.941 --> 00:35:00.941
<v Speaker 2>when I saw him beat Yoshida was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if this fucking guy really dedicates </v>

772
00:35:00.941 --> 00:35:04.590
<v Speaker 2>himself and really dial down and gets to</v>
<v Speaker 2>an optimum weight and you know,</v>

773
00:35:04.620 --> 00:35:05.600
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who the fuck is going to?</v>

774
00:35:05.650 --> 00:35:08.510
<v Speaker 2>He was supposed to fight again I suppose</v>
<v Speaker 2>by fader.</v>

775
00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:10.930
<v Speaker 2>They offered him over $1 million to </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>

776
00:35:11.150 --> 00:35:14.420
<v Speaker 2>I did those deals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't offer $1 million.</v>

777
00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:17.270
<v Speaker 2>Now the fight was for Nogueira on two </v>
<v Speaker 2>weeks notice,</v>

778
00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:20.740
<v Speaker 2>but that was a different offer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there was an offer for fader.</v>

779
00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:21.790
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there wasn't.</v>

780
00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:24.620
<v Speaker 2>So it's bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

781
00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:30.040
<v Speaker 2>it was the first deal I ever did as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>manager was 10 years ago and they called</v>

782
00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:33.110
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They wanted to fight no guarantee on two</v>

783
00:35:33.111 --> 00:35:35.840
<v Speaker 2>weeks notice or tend to accept that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but pride was always like that.</v>

784
00:35:35.841 --> 00:35:38.100
<v Speaker 2>You always found out two or weeks here </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to fight</v>

785
00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:39.840
<v Speaker 1>rule on Herman train.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

786
00:35:39.841 --> 00:35:40.860
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't been training.</v>

787
00:35:41.690 --> 00:35:44.640
<v Speaker 1>You didn't train for the first one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go out there,</v>

788
00:35:45.180 --> 00:35:47.370
<v Speaker 1>shoot a double leg.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want,</v>

789
00:35:47.371 --> 00:35:50.370
<v Speaker 1>stick your arm at the Yo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing's going to happen.</v>

790
00:35:50.371 --> 00:35:53.200
<v Speaker 1>You're going to be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we told him to take it,</v>

791
00:35:53.940 --> 00:35:56.160
<v Speaker 1>but I'm just saying if you get scared,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

792
00:35:56.170 --> 00:35:59.280
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which really put that in his head.</v>

793
00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:01.550
<v Speaker 1>If you get scared putting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>leave your arm.</v>

794
00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:02.630
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course not.</v>

795
00:36:02.631 --> 00:36:07.631
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to say four sided already,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean really what's going to </v>

796
00:36:07.631 --> 00:36:11.460
<v Speaker 1>happen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're just going to get your big goal </v>

797
00:36:11.460 --> 00:36:13.861
<v Speaker 1>out there and if you get and you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>like or you feel tapped out the care </v>

798
00:36:13.861 --> 00:36:14.880
<v Speaker 1>setting so he's not going to try to </v>
<v Speaker 1>break your arm.</v>

799
00:36:15.570 --> 00:36:19.860
<v Speaker 1>So it was a crazy like six hour </v>
<v Speaker 1>negotiated back and forth and we're at a</v>

800
00:36:19.861 --> 00:36:24.861
<v Speaker 1>huge number and it turned out to be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>three fight deal worth well over a </v>

801
00:36:25.530 --> 00:36:25.530
<v Speaker 1>million dollars.</v>

802
00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:28.120
<v Speaker 1>The majority of it was for that fight on</v>
<v Speaker 1>two weeks notice.</v>

803
00:36:28.121 --> 00:36:30.300
<v Speaker 1>And then he decided that he didn't want </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do it the next day,</v>

804
00:36:31.410 --> 00:36:34.740
<v Speaker 1>but it didn't end there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he was given the opportunity on</v>

805
00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:38.610
<v Speaker 1>two days notice to fight butter being at</v>

<v Speaker 1>Physicals and everything were all lined </v>

811
00:36:51.681 --> 00:36:55.521

812
00:36:55.521 --> 00:36:55.521
<v Speaker 1>done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would've smashed butter bean.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Seeing him too on this kind of freak </v>
<v Speaker 1>show</v>

850
00:38:36.490 --> 00:38:37.840
<v Speaker 2>on TV.</v>

851
00:38:37.841 --> 00:38:42.010
<v Speaker 2>this is a goddamn Olympic gold medalist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is a great wrestler,</v>

852
00:38:42.070 --> 00:38:47.070
<v Speaker 2>great athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you've seen them on the biggest </v>

853
00:38:47.070 --> 00:38:47.070
<v Speaker 2>loser.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

854
00:38:47.070 --> 00:38:47.620
<v Speaker 2>this is really the only way he can lose </v>
<v Speaker 2>weight.</v>

855
00:38:47.621 --> 00:38:48.790
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand it.</v>

856
00:38:52.420 --> 00:38:53.530
<v Speaker 2>That's how it goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

857
00:38:53.531 --> 00:38:55.300
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the life of the athlete.</v>

858
00:38:55.570 --> 00:38:57.970
<v Speaker 2>Now when you're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're a trainer,</v>

859
00:38:58.060 --> 00:39:03.060
<v Speaker 2>but you're also a manager.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you're involved in a lot of </v>

860
00:39:03.060 --> 00:39:03.060
<v Speaker 2>different.</v>

861
00:39:03.060 --> 00:39:03.990
<v Speaker 3>A long development process.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For me,</v>

862
00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:09.040
<v Speaker 3>I started,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got a chiropractic degree and we go </v>

863
00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:13.131
<v Speaker 3>back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wrestled at Arizona State and met Dan </v>

864
00:39:13.131 --> 00:39:13.131
<v Speaker 3>Henderson there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Heat sims were there.</v>

865
00:39:13.131 --> 00:39:17.930
<v Speaker 3>Randy couture would be out there a </v>
<v Speaker 3>little bit and then I moved to </v>

866
00:39:17.930 --> 00:39:19.520
<v Speaker 3>California after that year later started</v>
<v Speaker 3>chiropractic school and continued.</v>

867
00:39:19.530 --> 00:39:21.900
<v Speaker 3>Dan and I were roommates for probably </v>
<v Speaker 3>six years,</v>

868
00:39:22.380 --> 00:39:24.180
<v Speaker 3>so the whole time I was in chiropractic </v>
<v Speaker 3>school,</v>

869
00:39:24.181 --> 00:39:28.020
<v Speaker 3>we would have training camps that are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have sarandrea come spend a month before</v>

870
00:39:28.021 --> 00:39:30.480
<v Speaker 3>the 96 Olympics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there were always guys coming in.</v>

871
00:39:30.481 --> 00:39:35.400
<v Speaker 3>So the only people that I ever worked </v>
<v Speaker 3>with were world class athletes.</v>

872
00:39:35.490 --> 00:39:37.380
<v Speaker 3>And as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as the transition,</v>

873
00:39:37.381 --> 00:39:42.381
<v Speaker 3>Emma came in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dan was the number one wrestler in the </v>

874
00:39:42.381 --> 00:39:45.210
<v Speaker 3>country and he made 12 grand a year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

875
00:39:46.130 --> 00:39:51.130
<v Speaker 3>As you get paid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you're the number on the national </v>

876
00:39:51.130 --> 00:39:51.180
<v Speaker 3>team,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he got a paycheck and that paycheck,</v>

877
00:39:51.181 --> 00:39:51.960
<v Speaker 3>thousand bucks a month.</v>

878
00:39:52.050 --> 00:39:55.440
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he got a call in,</v>

879
00:39:55.470 --> 00:39:59.410
<v Speaker 3>I think it's 2008 to fight in Brazil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

880
00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:01.440
<v Speaker 3>how much does it pay as well?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's three fights in one night.</v>

881
00:40:01.441 --> 00:40:03.390
<v Speaker 3>If you win,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get $12,000.</v>

882
00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:07.410
<v Speaker 3>And Dan I think had been in street </v>
<v Speaker 3>fights in his whole life and he goes,</v>

883
00:40:07.411 --> 00:40:08.790
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went down,</v>

884
00:40:08.791 --> 00:40:13.791
<v Speaker 3>there is only Dan Henderson [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 3>those three fights and that's his </v>

885
00:40:13.791 --> 00:40:14.270
<v Speaker 3>career.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Got started.</v>

886
00:40:14.290 --> 00:40:16.020
<v Speaker 3>Now we've got one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of them by submission.</v>

887
00:40:16.510 --> 00:40:18.150
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was the coolest submission ever.</v>

888
00:40:18.180 --> 00:40:19.890
<v Speaker 3>Guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was a guillotine.</v>

889
00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:25.280
<v Speaker 3>He was standing up and the guy passed </v>
<v Speaker 3>out on his feet and Dan ended up in a </v>

890
00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:25.410
<v Speaker 3>mount position.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

891
00:40:25.470 --> 00:40:29.600
<v Speaker 3>And then he beat another Carlson gracie </v>
<v Speaker 3>black belt and the guy tapped.</v>

892
00:40:29.601 --> 00:40:31.680
<v Speaker 3>The crowd didn't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The crowds storm the cage.</v>

893
00:40:31.681 --> 00:40:34.760
<v Speaker 3>It was a crazy moment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The crowds didn't like that.</v>

894
00:40:34.761 --> 00:40:39.761
<v Speaker 3>The guy tapped,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the crowd thought the stoppage was </v>

895
00:40:39.761 --> 00:40:39.870
<v Speaker 3>early.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

896
00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:41.820
<v Speaker 3>and then there was a little bit of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>riot,</v>

897
00:40:41.821 --> 00:40:46.510
<v Speaker 3>but the cage was really tall and they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they kind of charged the Cajun Navy.</v>

898
00:40:46.530 --> 00:40:48.290
<v Speaker 3>The lights went out or something that </v>
<v Speaker 3>wasn't there.</v>

899
00:40:48.300 --> 00:40:51.480
<v Speaker 3>Just in second hand on this one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's been awhile.</v>

900
00:40:51.780 --> 00:40:54.390
<v Speaker 2>The lights used to go out in those </v>
<v Speaker 2>Brazilian mma valley.</v>

901
00:40:54.450 --> 00:40:58.100
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] shit was going back to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>cage.</v>

902
00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:00.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eugenio today.</v>

903
00:41:00.390 --> 00:41:02.040
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

904
00:41:02.170 --> 00:41:03.150
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Henzel Gracie,</v>

905
00:41:03.170 --> 00:41:04.980
<v Speaker 2>remember the lights went out and hands </v>
<v Speaker 2>on was losing.</v>

906
00:41:06.090 --> 00:41:06.770
<v Speaker 3>So he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

907
00:41:06.820 --> 00:41:08.560
<v Speaker 3>down in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the guy then said,</v>

908
00:41:08.561 --> 00:41:08.890
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

909
00:41:08.891 --> 00:41:10.900
<v Speaker 3>I've lost my momentum.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to fight again.</v>

910
00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:13.790

<v Speaker 3>lost my.</v>

911
00:41:13.940 --> 00:41:15.790
<v Speaker 3>And I think that he said something like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

912
00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:18.130
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:36.650
<v Speaker 1>or the year before something fader </v>
<v Speaker 1>fought and rings.</v>

919
00:41:36.651 --> 00:41:38.180

<v Speaker 1>tournament,</v>

920
00:41:39.410 --> 00:41:41.960
<v Speaker 1>I'd have to go look at a record,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Dan fights.</v>

921
00:41:42.020 --> 00:41:43.010

923
00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:48.980
<v Speaker 1>ballou.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He fought a Gilbert ival and he fought.</v>

924
00:41:49.220 --> 00:41:51.080
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no gear.</v>

925
00:41:51.081 --> 00:41:53.780
<v Speaker 1>Big Nogueira wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was funny on the bus.</v>

926
00:41:53.781 --> 00:41:55.190
<v Speaker 1>Know Gary told me this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>years later,</v>

927
00:41:55.191 --> 00:41:58.070
<v Speaker 1>nugget one the term,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the next year they paid Dan $200,000</v>

928
00:41:58.071 --> 00:42:03.071
<v Speaker 1>in cash as Japanese gangsters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll send a trash walked in afterwards </v>

929
00:42:03.071 --> 00:42:05.990
<v Speaker 1>and they handed him $200,000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guys do what?</v>

930
00:42:05.991 --> 00:42:10.991
<v Speaker 1>The cash.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We didn't really know what to do with </v>

931
00:42:10.991 --> 00:42:10.991
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was me,</v>

932
00:42:10.991 --> 00:42:11.180
<v Speaker 1>Dan and randy walking around the streets</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Tokyo.</v>

933
00:42:11.181 --> 00:42:14.090
<v Speaker 1>$200,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a backpack trying to figure out,</v>

934
00:42:14.091 --> 00:42:17.350
<v Speaker 1>do we wire this wire it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How'd you get it back to America?</v>

935
00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:22.360
<v Speaker 1>It just ended up brought it back and Dan</v>
<v Speaker 1>claimed it and pay the attorneys do </v>

936
00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:22.360
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

937
00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:26.230
<v Speaker 1>You could tell a hundred grand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just have to tell them because he </v>

938
00:42:26.230 --> 00:42:28.150
<v Speaker 1>wasn't just selling coke and Tokyo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

939
00:42:28.151 --> 00:42:30.290
<v Speaker 1>As long as you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have this money.</v>

940
00:42:30.580 --> 00:42:31.670
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see.</v>

941
00:42:31.730 --> 00:42:36.730
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone knows about it was John John </v>

942
00:42:36.730 --> 00:42:37.070
<v Speaker 1>when he fought over in Japan against </v>
<v Speaker 1>frank trigg.</v>

943
00:42:37.130 --> 00:42:42.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first fight I ever cornered someone </v>

944
00:42:42.130 --> 00:42:42.130
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

945
00:42:42.130 --> 00:42:42.130
<v Speaker 1>was it really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

946
00:42:42.130 --> 00:42:42.470
<v Speaker 1>I acquired frank trigg in that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

947
00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:44.960
<v Speaker 1>In 1998.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Randy in in a way on that.</v>

948
00:42:45.020 --> 00:42:47.780
<v Speaker 1>They took the money and they'll do it to</v>
<v Speaker 1>like all the brothers.</v>

949
00:42:47.810 --> 00:42:49.850
<v Speaker 1>They all brought it over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>

950
00:42:49.910 --> 00:42:51.590
<v Speaker 1>You only have to figure out how to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

951
00:42:51.970 --> 00:42:54.800
<v Speaker 1>Chef pants you don't have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't have more than 10,000</v>

952
00:42:54.801 --> 00:42:59.801
<v Speaker 1>bucks on you without claiming it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You allow to be a baller with like 9,999</v>

953
00:43:00.561 --> 00:43:02.300
<v Speaker 1>bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think in those days.</v>

954
00:43:02.301 --> 00:43:07.301
<v Speaker 1>Everyone who fought in pride probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>shove some in their underwear when they </v>

955
00:43:07.301 --> 00:43:07.301
<v Speaker 1>were coming through and cross your </v>
<v Speaker 1>fingers.</v>

956
00:43:07.301 --> 00:43:12.300
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything was paid in cash over there </v>

957
00:43:12.300 --> 00:43:12.300
<v Speaker 1>because you know when you fill out a </v>
<v Speaker 1>customs form,</v>

958
00:43:12.300 --> 00:43:13.730
<v Speaker 1>it asks you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you have more than $10,000?</v>

959
00:43:14.180 --> 00:43:17.030
<v Speaker 1>He collects no and weird month number.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

960
00:43:17.390 --> 00:43:18.380
<v Speaker 1>I have to pick a number,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

961
00:43:18.381 --> 00:43:19.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have to pick a number.</v>

962
00:43:19.401 --> 00:43:23.030
<v Speaker 1>I think that's like one of those numbers</v>
<v Speaker 1>to like if you deposit it in their bank,</v>

963
00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:28.240
<v Speaker 1>like red flags go off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's more than 10 grand so you have to </v>

964
00:43:28.240 --> 00:43:31.721
<v Speaker 1>like sneak in like nine that started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that started in the 80s and for all the </v>

965
00:43:31.721 --> 00:43:32.330
<v Speaker 1>coke in Miami.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

966
00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:35.210
<v Speaker 1>but if it wasn't for coke in Miami in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>mattress to be.</v>

967
00:43:35.211 --> 00:43:35.830
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Miami.</v>

968
00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:38.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>More more banks per capita than anywhere</v>

969
00:43:38.481 --> 00:43:40.160
<v Speaker 1>else in the fucking country for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason.</v>

970
00:43:40.620 --> 00:43:45.620
<v Speaker 1>And the cowboys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My favorite documentary and cooking </v>

971
00:43:45.620 --> 00:43:46.100
<v Speaker 1>cowboys too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen to maybe even better?</v>

972
00:43:47.720 --> 00:43:48.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Billy Corbin,</v>

973
00:43:49.250 --> 00:43:50.960
<v Speaker 1>I gotta get that guy on the podcast one </v>
<v Speaker 1>of these days.</v>

974
00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:54.710
<v Speaker 1>The Guy who produced the awesome guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking great documentaries,</v>

975
00:43:54.711 --> 00:43:55.670
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so well done.</v>

976
00:43:55.671 --> 00:43:58.310
<v Speaker 1>It just such a crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy fucking story.</v>

977
00:43:58.610 --> 00:43:59.810
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dan,</v>

978
00:44:00.440 --> 00:44:01.910
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>$200,000</v>

979
00:44:01.911 --> 00:44:06.911
<v Speaker 1>in cash.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it was funny you saw he really saw </v>

980
00:44:06.911 --> 00:44:09.770
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dan was made of in that because I think </v>

981
00:44:09.770 --> 00:44:11.951
<v Speaker 1>he probably took his first fight was </v>
<v Speaker 1>with Gilbert evil and he probably took </v>

982
00:44:11.951 --> 00:44:13.850
<v Speaker 1>them down 14 times and then knocked him </v>
<v Speaker 1>down at the beginning,</v>

983
00:44:13.851 --> 00:44:16.480
<v Speaker 1>which had never been done before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He almost are barred.</v>

984
00:44:16.510 --> 00:44:18.450
<v Speaker 1>Then he probably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone will have to come.</v>

985
00:44:18.500 --> 00:44:21.800
<v Speaker 1>I think it was well over 10 takedowns </v>
<v Speaker 1>and when he came to the back,</v>

986
00:44:21.801 --> 00:44:26.801
<v Speaker 1>because you have a fairly quick </v>
<v Speaker 1>turnaround time and those tournament </v>

987
00:44:26.801 --> 00:44:26.801
<v Speaker 1>days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a whole different mentality.</v>

988
00:44:26.860 --> 00:44:29.090
<v Speaker 1>So you go back into the locker room </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself out?</v>

989
00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:30.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in his head,</v>

990
00:44:30.681 --> 00:44:32.310
<v Speaker 1>never.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His forearms were so</v>

991
00:44:32.310 --> 00:44:37.310
<v Speaker 3>swollen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He couldn't really make a make a fist </v>

992
00:44:37.310 --> 00:44:39.420
<v Speaker 3>and then he fought Bob Lou.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just think so much grappling,</v>

993
00:44:39.421 --> 00:44:42.240
<v Speaker 3>so much squeezing and they just weren't </v>
<v Speaker 3>settling down.</v>

994
00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:47.600
<v Speaker 3>Then they went and fought Bob Ballou and</v>
<v Speaker 3>his knee got hurt and I remember turned </v>

995
00:44:47.600 --> 00:44:48.620
<v Speaker 3>into randy between before the </v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible].</v>

996
00:44:48.780 --> 00:44:53.780
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if he can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if he can go out there and </v>

997
00:44:54.001 --> 00:44:56.010
<v Speaker 3>Dan was hobbling around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He preaches laying there.</v>

998
00:44:56.011 --> 00:44:58.620
<v Speaker 3>He couldn't move at all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>couldn't move his leg.</v>

999
00:44:58.621 --> 00:45:03.621
<v Speaker 3>His arms are still swollen mean he was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His whole body was seizing up and we've </v>

1000
00:45:03.621 --> 00:45:07.340
<v Speaker 3>Kinda got them moving a little bit and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's when they play the national </v>

1001
00:45:07.340 --> 00:45:07.340
<v Speaker 3>anthem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Before the finals,</v>

1002
00:45:07.340 --> 00:45:11.990
<v Speaker 3>you could see his whole physiology and </v>
<v Speaker 3>posture change was really a cool moment </v>

1003
00:45:11.990 --> 00:45:15.441
<v Speaker 3>to see and everything changed and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>went down there and and fought a very </v>

1004
00:45:15.441 --> 00:45:19.101
<v Speaker 3>close fight with Nogueira giving up and </v>
<v Speaker 3>all those guys weighed over 240 pound </v>

1005
00:45:19.101 --> 00:45:23.511
<v Speaker 3>Dan is every bit of 200 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He fought all three of them and won a </v>

1006
00:45:23.511 --> 00:45:26.040
<v Speaker 3>bunch of money and that's kind of how he</v>
<v Speaker 3>got his start end up in pride after that</v>

1007
00:45:27.290 --> 00:45:31.440
<v Speaker 2>national anthem fire to my papa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can see,</v>

1008
00:45:31.810 --> 00:45:33.110
<v Speaker 2>you can see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he can see it.</v>

1009
00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:35.160
<v Speaker 3>Shane is a whole change in him when it </v>
<v Speaker 3>happened.</v>

1010
00:45:35.350 --> 00:45:40.350
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It has to be something above and beyond </v>

1011
00:45:40.350 --> 00:45:40.980
<v Speaker 3>yourself to get through moments like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1012
00:45:41.320 --> 00:45:42.830
<v Speaker 3>If it's nationalism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is,</v>

1013
00:45:42.831 --> 00:45:47.831
<v Speaker 3>they'll carry you through.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He got it done and they ended up ended </v>

1014
00:45:47.831 --> 00:45:47.831
<v Speaker 3>up in pride after that.</v>

1015

<v Speaker 2>He choked me out.</v>

1033
00:46:26.541 --> 00:46:29.420
<v Speaker 2>He was out and as Matt Hughes was </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting choked out,</v>

1034
00:46:29.421 --> 00:46:31.520
<v Speaker 2>he slammed him on his head and knocked </v>
<v Speaker 2>him out cold.</v>

1035
00:46:31.820 --> 00:46:36.820
<v Speaker 2>So Matt Hughes woke up the champion and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that was after Carlos had caught and pat</v>

1036
00:46:39.051 --> 00:46:42.290
<v Speaker 2>miletich and the first ever bulldog </v>
<v Speaker 2>choke in MMA economy.</v>

1037
00:46:42.310 --> 00:46:45.680
<v Speaker 2>The school you're at that school yard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>headlock and sat back,</v>

1038
00:46:45.740 --> 00:46:47.480
<v Speaker 2>which is fucking very effective.</v>

1039
00:46:47.480 --> 00:46:49.370
<v Speaker 2>Move hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to get out of.</v>

1040
00:46:49.371 --> 00:46:54.371
<v Speaker 2>Hard to get out of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a weird move that people sort of </v>

1041
00:46:54.371 --> 00:46:56.741
<v Speaker 2>disrespect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's weird because they respect the </v>

1042
00:46:56.741 --> 00:46:56.741
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] [inaudible] I guess the good</v>
<v Speaker 2>team,</v>

1043
00:46:56.741 --> 00:47:01.301
<v Speaker 2>even as even they respect the standing </v>
<v Speaker 2>18 like John Jones did on Machita are </v>

1044
00:47:01.301 --> 00:47:04.130
<v Speaker 2>and Weidman did on who did hooded me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>catching the standard routine.</v>

1045
00:47:05.960 --> 00:47:08.930
<v Speaker 2>I forget it was a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter,</v>

1046
00:47:09.260 --> 00:47:11.000
<v Speaker 2>but they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For whatever reason,</v>

1047
00:47:11.001 --> 00:47:13.070
<v Speaker 2>the school yard choke is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1048
00:47:13.100 --> 00:47:14.910
<v Speaker 2>come on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's because there's so much discretion.</v>

1049
00:47:15.010 --> 00:47:17.000
<v Speaker 2>Choke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's brutal.</v>

1050
00:47:17.001 --> 00:47:19.270
<v Speaker 2>It's probably the strongest of all jokes</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you can get there.</v>

1051
00:47:19.280 --> 00:47:24.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get your backing into it and you're </v>

1052
00:47:24.280 --> 00:47:24.280
<v Speaker 2>pushing off with your legs and digging </v>
<v Speaker 2>in with it.</v>

1053
00:47:24.280 --> 00:47:27.010
<v Speaker 2>I mean a bunch of guys that got it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chris lytle got it on Tki.</v>

1054
00:47:27.140 --> 00:47:32.140
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's happened a few times in the since </v>

1055
00:47:32.140 --> 00:47:34.591
<v Speaker 2>then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think I'm pretty sure when Newton </v>

1056
00:47:34.591 --> 00:47:37.051
<v Speaker 2>got pat miletich and it was the first </v>
<v Speaker 2>time anybody ever pull that choke off </v>

1057
00:47:37.051 --> 00:47:38.620
<v Speaker 2>and that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's another one of those techniques.</v>

1058
00:47:38.620 --> 00:47:39.310
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1059
00:47:39.311 --> 00:47:41.770
<v Speaker 2>those things that's real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a real move.</v>

1060
00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:43.540
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1061
00:47:43.541 --> 00:47:46.270
<v Speaker 2>and over the course of the x amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>

1062
00:47:46.271 --> 00:47:49.150
<v Speaker 2>so 21 years since the UFC started,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've,</v>

1063
00:47:49.480 --> 00:47:54.480
<v Speaker 2>every now and then we'll see one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>those things pop up and then you see </v>

1064
00:47:54.480 --> 00:47:54.480
<v Speaker 2>them everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1065
00:47:54.480 --> 00:47:54.790
<v Speaker 2>you see one pop up like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1066
00:47:54.791 --> 00:47:56.200
<v Speaker 2>now it's everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1067
00:47:56.470 --> 00:47:57.640
<v Speaker 2>it's cool though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>

1068
00:47:58.030 --> 00:47:58.750
<v Speaker 2>It's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the,</v>

1069
00:47:58.990 --> 00:48:01.090
<v Speaker 2>it's a real joy in this sport.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a development.</v>

1070
00:48:01.690 --> 00:48:03.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll kind of seeing that through.</v>

1071
00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:09.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love when new things like that come </v>

1072
00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:09.000
<v Speaker 2>up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

1073
00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:10.270
<v Speaker 2>And one of the new things that you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>seeing now is,</v>

1074
00:48:10.420 --> 00:48:12.880
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't seen it in the UFC yet,</v>

1075
00:48:12.881 --> 00:48:17.881
<v Speaker 2>but I know we're going to see it soon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that baseball bat choke from the </v>

1076
00:48:17.881 --> 00:48:17.980
<v Speaker 2>bottom?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you seen that?</v>

1077
00:48:18.460 --> 00:48:23.460
<v Speaker 2>There's this crazy new choke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The guys who are doing it was a good </v>

1078
00:48:23.460 --> 00:48:23.460
<v Speaker 2>joke and someone figured out how to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1079
00:48:23.460 --> 00:48:26.260
<v Speaker 2>No biggie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like when you're on the bottom,</v>

1080
00:48:26.261 --> 00:48:28.750
<v Speaker 2>when the guy's on top of you inside </v>
<v Speaker 2>control,</v>

1081
00:48:28.990 --> 00:48:32.710
<v Speaker 2>you wrap your arm over his head like </v>
<v Speaker 2>this with like palm up.</v>

1082
00:48:32.890 --> 00:48:35.980
<v Speaker 2>You grab it like this and pinch it down </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's death.</v>

1083
00:48:36.340 --> 00:48:41.340
<v Speaker 2>It's death when guys are good at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They clamp a hold of your neck and </v>

1084
00:48:41.340 --> 00:48:44.281
<v Speaker 2>you're going out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got a couple seconds to either </v>

1085
00:48:44.281 --> 00:48:44.281
<v Speaker 2>tabs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both sides,</v>

1086
00:48:44.281 --> 00:48:44.281
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Both sides,</v>

1087
00:48:44.281 --> 00:48:48.510
<v Speaker 2>and if guys are good at it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know it's one of those things where </v>

1088
00:48:48.510 --> 00:48:49.900
<v Speaker 2>you teach a guy how to do a good routine</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he doesn't really know it yet.</v>

1089
00:48:49.980 --> 00:48:51.880
<v Speaker 2>Be showing the movement and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1090
00:48:51.881 --> 00:48:53.950
<v Speaker 2>get me into gear to and as soon as he </v>
<v Speaker 2>tries to slap it on,</v>

1091
00:48:54.070 --> 00:48:56.080
<v Speaker 2>you grab his wrist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you pull your head up,</v>

1092
00:48:56.081 --> 00:49:01.081
<v Speaker 2>your posture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get yourself out of it and you're </v>

1093
00:49:01.081 --> 00:49:03.691
<v Speaker 2>free.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know it's because you're better at </v>

1094
00:49:03.691 --> 00:49:05.320
<v Speaker 2>the defense than he is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when it's a position that you're not</v>

1095
00:49:05.321 --> 00:49:10.321
<v Speaker 2>used to defending and this baseball bat </v>
<v Speaker 2>job position than a lot of people are </v>

1096
00:49:10.321 --> 00:49:10.321
<v Speaker 2>not used to fund these.</v>

1097
00:49:10.321 --> 00:49:15.060
<v Speaker 2>A bunch of positions that people just </v>
<v Speaker 2>not used to finding themselves in those </v>

1098
00:49:15.060 --> 00:49:16.180
<v Speaker 2>critical seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's critical,</v>

1099
00:49:16.181 --> 00:49:18.670
<v Speaker 2>may not even seconds like fractions of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>second.</v>

1100
00:49:18.820 --> 00:49:23.820
<v Speaker 2>From when you realize that choke is </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting on to where you have to defend </v>

1101
00:49:23.820 --> 00:49:27.391
<v Speaker 2>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you don't do it at six on either </v>

1102
00:49:27.391 --> 00:49:27.391
<v Speaker 2>your neck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like fuck,</v>

1103
00:49:27.391 --> 00:49:28.810
<v Speaker 2>like you might not be able to get out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

1104
00:49:28.811 --> 00:49:32.850
<v Speaker 2>There's that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The window between safe and fucking.</v>

1105
00:49:32.860 --> 00:49:35.420
<v Speaker 2>I missed the boat I missed upon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm fucking drowning shit.</v>

1106
00:49:35.710 --> 00:49:38.050
<v Speaker 2>Your destinies in that window.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that crazy?</v>

1107
00:49:38.110 --> 00:49:43.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The destinies in those windows and the </v>

1108
00:49:43.110 --> 00:49:43.780
<v Speaker 2>scrambles also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is a thing that we're seeing in</v>

1109
00:49:43.850 --> 00:49:48.850
<v Speaker 2>mma a lot lately is scrambles off the </v>
<v Speaker 2>cage and the striking in the scrambles </v>

1110
00:49:50.140 --> 00:49:53.110
<v Speaker 2>you're seeing like these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these little mini moments,</v>

1111
00:49:53.290 --> 00:49:58.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where the guys are separating and one </v>

1112
00:49:58.290 --> 00:50:00.721
<v Speaker 2>guy will land in need of the body hard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>neither the body and the other is an </v>

1113
00:50:00.721 --> 00:50:00.721
<v Speaker 2>opening for both guys.</v>

1114
00:50:00.721 --> 00:50:02.680
<v Speaker 2>But one guy maybe decided to take a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit of a break,</v>

1115
00:50:02.980 --> 00:50:04.240
<v Speaker 2>breathe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1116
00:50:04.241 --> 00:50:09.241
<v Speaker 2>and pace himself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the other guy pushed it and </v>

1117
00:50:09.241 --> 00:50:10.570
<v Speaker 2>capitalized in land.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where I spend 95% of my.</v>

1118
00:50:10.571 --> 00:50:15.571
<v Speaker 2>If I'm coaching two sides,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really just kind of artist </v>

1119
00:50:15.571 --> 00:50:15.571
<v Speaker 2>development,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1120
00:50:15.571 --> 00:50:18.360
<v Speaker 2>So there's the management side to it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>negotiating,</v>

1121
00:50:18.370 --> 00:50:19.030
<v Speaker 2>deal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sponsor,</v>

1122
00:50:19.031 --> 00:50:24.031
<v Speaker 2>that type of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a healthcare side of it because </v>

1123
00:50:24.031 --> 00:50:26.101
<v Speaker 2>you have to take care of your body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're just helping people deal with </v>

1124
00:50:26.101 --> 00:50:26.710
<v Speaker 2>the media.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's finding developmental fights and</v>

1125
00:50:26.711 --> 00:50:31.711
<v Speaker 2>then there's training aspect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what I do on the training side of </v>

1126
00:50:31.711 --> 00:50:33.110
<v Speaker 2>things is just what you said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's it's those moments,</v>

1127
00:50:33.111 --> 00:50:38.111
<v Speaker 2>those transitional moments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we'll have experts come in who will </v>

1128
00:50:38.111 --> 00:50:39.020
<v Speaker 2>do the Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had finished that show,</v>

1129
00:50:39.021 --> 00:50:44.021
<v Speaker 2>what's the best way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the strikers who will hold pads and </v>

1130
00:50:44.021 --> 00:50:47.231
<v Speaker 2>the coach for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My job is to kind of tie everything all </v>

1131
00:50:47.231 --> 00:50:47.231
<v Speaker 2>together and tying it together.</v>

1132
00:50:47.231 --> 00:50:51.850
<v Speaker 2>You have to have a good understanding of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the big picture and understand how you </v>

1133
00:50:51.850 --> 00:50:56.141
<v Speaker 2>start connecting these dots between all </v>
<v Speaker 2>these different things and that's the </v>

1134
00:50:56.141 --> 00:50:59.171
<v Speaker 2>key to where [inaudible] heading in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not who can do the best arm bar </v>

1135
00:50:59.171 --> 00:51:00.680
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's this transitional moments.</v>

1136
00:51:00.681 --> 00:51:05.681
<v Speaker 2>That's the why are you doing what you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing and finding those opportunities </v>

1137
00:51:05.681 --> 00:51:06.520
<v Speaker 2>and those moments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1138
00:51:06.540 --> 00:51:11.540
<v Speaker 2>It's also we've had a chance to see this</v>
<v Speaker 2>progress and we see the whole game </v>

1139
00:51:12.501 --> 00:51:17.450
<v Speaker 2>change or used to be like for a long </v>
<v Speaker 2>time or the Mark Coleman era.</v>

1140
00:51:17.630 --> 00:51:22.630
<v Speaker 2>It was the big powerful wrestler.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They could take guys down and smash </v>

1141
00:51:22.630 --> 00:51:26.351
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then those guys were fucked body </v>

1142
00:51:26.351 --> 00:51:26.351
<v Speaker 2>body head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1143
00:51:26.351 --> 00:51:28.280
<v Speaker 2>But then we found guys like Maury Smith </v>
<v Speaker 2>that could survive.</v>

1144
00:51:28.400 --> 00:51:33.400
<v Speaker 2>They had really good cardio and then he </v>
<v Speaker 2>would start dragging you into the later </v>

1145
00:51:33.400 --> 00:51:34.730
<v Speaker 2>rounds and kicking the shit out of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>legs.</v>

1146
00:51:34.910 --> 00:51:36.200
<v Speaker 2>So then it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh fuck,</v>

1147
00:51:36.201 --> 00:51:37.370
<v Speaker 2>there's that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

1148
00:51:37.371 --> 00:51:40.520
<v Speaker 2>And then in pride you saw cro,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cop,</v>

1149
00:51:40.610 --> 00:51:42.430
<v Speaker 2>Cro,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cop came along and change it.</v>

1150
00:51:42.440 --> 00:51:46.730
<v Speaker 2>Now here's a guy who is got vicious </v>
<v Speaker 2>takedown defense.</v>

1151
00:51:46.870 --> 00:51:50.570
<v Speaker 2>His take down defense is catlike and if </v>
<v Speaker 2>he kicks you,</v>

1152
00:51:50.720 --> 00:51:52.370
<v Speaker 2>you're not even going to know what the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck happened.</v>

1153
00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:57.400
<v Speaker 2>You're just going to be out cold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And his highlight reel over and over </v>

1154
00:51:57.400 --> 00:52:00.590
<v Speaker 2>again is him head kicking the Shit Outta</v>
<v Speaker 2>Emelianenko head,</v>

1155
00:52:00.591 --> 00:52:05.591
<v Speaker 2>kicking the shit out of a grove of </v>
<v Speaker 2>chanting head kicking the shit out of </v>

1156
00:52:05.591 --> 00:52:06.020
<v Speaker 2>everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boom,</v>

1157
00:52:06.021 --> 00:52:08.110
<v Speaker 2>boom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Vandelay Boehm.</v>

1158
00:52:08.240 --> 00:52:10.970
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's going asleep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Left high kick poem.</v>

1159
00:52:11.430 --> 00:52:12.940
<v Speaker 2>It's like fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now this,</v>

1160
00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:15.140
<v Speaker 2>this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

1161
00:52:15.141 --> 00:52:15.980
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1162
00:52:16.250 --> 00:52:18.620
<v Speaker 2>then we realized when he came over to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the UFC,</v>

1163
00:52:18.980 --> 00:52:20.450
<v Speaker 2>you got to see a couple of things going </v>
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>

1164
00:52:20.570 --> 00:52:25.570
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of speculation like what </v>

1165
00:52:25.570 --> 00:52:27.590
<v Speaker 2>was he doing with his body when he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>in pride?</v>

1166
00:52:27.700 --> 00:52:30.650
<v Speaker 2>What was he doing as far as like </v>
<v Speaker 2>supplementation?</v>

1167
00:52:30.651 --> 00:52:33.080
<v Speaker 2>What was he doing as far as like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>performance enhancing drugs?</v>

1168
00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:36.080
<v Speaker 2>Was he involved in anything because he </v>
<v Speaker 2>was a different fighter.</v>

1169
00:52:36.230 --> 00:52:41.230
<v Speaker 2>He's a different fighter from pride to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the UFC and then he fought Gonzaga and </v>

1170
00:52:41.230 --> 00:52:43.220
<v Speaker 2>you saw the difference between what </v>
<v Speaker 2>happens when you get stuck on the cage.</v>

1171
00:52:43.460 --> 00:52:46.760
<v Speaker 2>What happens when a guy is not used to </v>
<v Speaker 2>training or fighting in a cage?</v>

1172
00:52:46.761 --> 00:52:51.761
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even think he had a cage in his </v>

1173
00:52:51.761 --> 00:52:51.761
<v Speaker 2>gym.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1174
00:52:51.761 --> 00:52:54.731
<v Speaker 2>before the Gonzaga fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it was used to that shit </v>

1175
00:52:54.731 --> 00:52:54.731
<v Speaker 2>at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And elbows on the ground.</v>

1176
00:52:54.731 --> 00:52:58.460
<v Speaker 2>That's another big element that the UFC </v>
<v Speaker 2>had over pride and Gonzaga fucked him up</v>

1177
00:52:58.520 --> 00:53:03.520
<v Speaker 2>before he ever had kicked him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was just beating the shit out of him </v>

1178
00:53:03.520 --> 00:53:03.680
<v Speaker 2>on the ground and elbowed him in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>head.</v>

1179
00:53:03.930 --> 00:53:05.660
<v Speaker 2>We've got to see that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>

1180
00:53:05.690 --> 00:53:10.690
<v Speaker 2>this transition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know when a guy like Gonzaga head </v>

1181
00:53:10.690 --> 00:53:10.690
<v Speaker 2>kick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a guy like cro cop,</v>

1182
00:53:10.740 --> 00:53:15.140
<v Speaker 2>that's an epic moment in that moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he crumbled was a cro cop,</v>

1183
00:53:15.141 --> 00:53:19.970
<v Speaker 2>cro cop was an epic moment in mma.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He got to see that there's,</v>

1184
00:53:20.030 --> 00:53:21.410
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's another level.</v>

1185
00:53:21.590 --> 00:53:23.360
<v Speaker 2>The level that you were fighting in and </v>
<v Speaker 2>pride,</v>

1186
00:53:23.361 --> 00:53:25.830
<v Speaker 2>as amazing as it was is not the highest </v>
<v Speaker 2>level.</v>

1187
00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:31.040
<v Speaker 1>Guys like Fujita guys like Gilbert Ivo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very tough guys where they're not the </v>

1188
00:53:31.040 --> 00:53:31.200
<v Speaker 1>high level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not.</v>

1189
00:53:31.230 --> 00:53:33.540
<v Speaker 1>They're not the junior dos Santos is of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

1190
00:53:33.750 --> 00:53:35.320
<v Speaker 1>They're not the Cain Velasquez of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>words.</v>

1191
00:53:35.340 --> 00:53:40.340
<v Speaker 1>There's a whole nother level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a whole nother thing that's a </v>

1192
00:53:40.340 --> 00:53:41.280
<v Speaker 1>beautiful thing about having several </v>
<v Speaker 1>organizations,</v>

1193
00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:43.490
<v Speaker 1>but that's a confusing thing about </v>
<v Speaker 1>having several,</v>

1194
00:53:43.560 --> 00:53:48.560
<v Speaker 1>several organizations because the guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>looks like a world beater when he's </v>

1195
00:53:48.560 --> 00:53:49.230
<v Speaker 1>fighting guys who are like mid level </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighters,</v>

1196
00:53:49.590 --> 00:53:51.900
<v Speaker 1>but then he goes over to the UFC and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1197
00:53:51.960 --> 00:53:56.960
<v Speaker 1>you put them in there against someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>like like a lumbar or like a high level </v>

1198
00:53:56.960 --> 00:53:57.540
<v Speaker 1>guy and you get to see what he's really </v>
<v Speaker 1>made out of.</v>

1199
00:53:57.960 --> 00:54:01.590
<v Speaker 1>There's probably not that talent pool to</v>
<v Speaker 1>support multiple organizations.</v>

1200
00:54:02.490 --> 00:54:03.330
<v Speaker 1>Not yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

1201
00:54:03.870 --> 00:54:08.870
<v Speaker 1>but it seems like they could develop it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem is there's very few people </v>

1202
00:54:08.870 --> 00:54:12.801
<v Speaker 1>really develop and talent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you have have kinda like a couple of </v>

1203
00:54:12.801 --> 00:54:12.801
<v Speaker 1>different pressure.</v>

1204
00:54:12.801 --> 00:54:13.520
<v Speaker 1>The thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's my.</v>

1205
00:54:13.800 --> 00:54:18.800
<v Speaker 1>If I'm giving advice to anyone who wants</v>
<v Speaker 1>to fight and you think you're going to </v>

1206
00:54:18.800 --> 00:54:19.080
<v Speaker 1>be good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to get out of a team,</v>

1207
00:54:19.250 --> 00:54:22.470
<v Speaker 1>individual group training situation as </v>
<v Speaker 1>quickly as possible.</v>

1208
00:54:22.560 --> 00:54:24.440
<v Speaker 1>In what way?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1209
00:54:24.450 --> 00:54:26.400
<v Speaker 1>So when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I got most started,</v>

1210
00:54:26.610 --> 00:54:31.610
<v Speaker 1>he hadn't fought before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He went from no fights to beat into </v>

1211
00:54:31.610 --> 00:54:34.050
<v Speaker 1>Sassy and becoming strikeforce champion </v>
<v Speaker 1>in 19 months.</v>

1212
00:54:34.300 --> 00:54:39.300
<v Speaker 1>And every single workout he did through </v>
<v Speaker 1>that entire time was for him on that </v>

1213
00:54:39.300 --> 00:54:40.800
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I see that's what you're saying.</v>

1214
00:54:40.801 --> 00:54:45.801
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The auntie she gave the air for group </v>

1215
00:54:45.801 --> 00:54:46.800
<v Speaker 1>training is for sparring sessions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if,</v>

1216
00:54:47.210 --> 00:54:50.910
<v Speaker 1>if you come from a karate background,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I come from a Jujitsu background.</v>

1217
00:54:50.970 --> 00:54:55.970
<v Speaker 1>Our developmental approach to fighting </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the UFC was going to be very </v>

1218
00:54:55.970 --> 00:54:59.481
<v Speaker 1>different if we do it the same,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the neither one of us are going to </v>

1219
00:54:59.481 --> 00:54:59.610
<v Speaker 1>progress as quickly as possible.</v>

1220
00:54:59.880 --> 00:55:02.220
<v Speaker 1>So you have to find someone who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>willing to work,</v>

1221
00:55:02.221 --> 00:55:07.221
<v Speaker 1>really invest time and energy into and </v>
<v Speaker 1>create a training structure and program </v>

1222
00:55:07.221 --> 00:55:09.450
<v Speaker 1>for you that you can get from here to </v>
<v Speaker 1>here as quickly as possible.</v>

1223
00:55:09.540 --> 00:55:12.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm a firm believer that starting at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>bottom is the worst place to start.</v>

1224
00:55:12.660 --> 00:55:14.850
<v Speaker 1>You have to take what skill someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>already does.</v>

1225
00:55:14.851 --> 00:55:19.851
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm presuming they came from a </v>

1226
00:55:19.851 --> 00:55:21.621
<v Speaker 1>background.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you wrestled or maybe you had a </v>

1227
00:55:21.621 --> 00:55:21.621
<v Speaker 1>black belt in Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have.</v>

1228
00:55:21.621 --> 00:55:24.390
<v Speaker 1>You have to take those approaches and as</v>
<v Speaker 1>quickly as possible get them to here and</v>

1229
00:55:24.470 --> 00:55:26.160
<v Speaker 1>they're often very different </v>
<v Speaker 1>trajectories.</v>

1230
00:55:26.430 --> 00:55:30.000
<v Speaker 1>What do you do with a young kid who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming up that doesn't have any skills?</v>

1231
00:55:30.180 --> 00:55:32.220
<v Speaker 1>They're just wanting to learn </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>

1232
00:55:32.610 --> 00:55:36.940
<v Speaker 1>I don't really work with those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what would you say to one though?</v>

1233
00:55:36.941 --> 00:55:39.510
<v Speaker 1>Like say if someone came along like some</v>
<v Speaker 1>15 year old kid says,</v>

1234
00:55:39.511 --> 00:55:41.430
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a huge UFC fan.</v>

1235
00:55:41.700 --> 00:55:44.400
<v Speaker 1>I want to fight him and Mary A,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how should I get started?</v>

1236
00:55:44.460 --> 00:55:46.800
<v Speaker 1>I would have him pick one discipline to </v>
<v Speaker 1>start.</v>

1237
00:55:46.801 --> 00:55:48.870
<v Speaker 1>If you're 15 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go wrestle.</v>

1238
00:55:49.380 --> 00:55:54.380
<v Speaker 1>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you are more drawn to boxing or </v>

1239
00:55:54.380 --> 00:55:54.380
<v Speaker 1>kickboxing and then go do that along the</v>
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>

1240
00:55:54.380 --> 00:55:57.930
<v Speaker 1>play and experiment a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but athlete development is changing now.</v>

1241
00:55:57.931 --> 00:56:00.870
<v Speaker 1>There's this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this trend for when kids are as young as</v>

1242
00:56:00.871 --> 00:56:01.860
<v Speaker 1>five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>six years old,</v>

1243
00:56:02.070 --> 00:56:04.080
<v Speaker 1>that there's these intensive training </v>
<v Speaker 1>program.</v>

1244
00:56:04.081 --> 00:56:06.120
<v Speaker 1>She have larger cities where there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>good resource,</v>

1245
00:56:06.121 --> 00:56:10.680
<v Speaker 1>good coaching and good facilities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They take these kids from an early age,</v>

1246
00:56:10.681 --> 00:56:12.960
<v Speaker 1>maybe they train with football or </v>
<v Speaker 1>basketball or hockey,</v>

1247
00:56:12.970 --> 00:56:16.410
<v Speaker 1>something like this with the intent of </v>
<v Speaker 1>developing professional athletes.</v>

1248
00:56:16.560 --> 00:56:20.400
<v Speaker 1>This approaches almost producing zero </v>
<v Speaker 1>professional athletes.</v>

1249
00:56:20.700 --> 00:56:23.950
<v Speaker 1>The ones who are successful are the ones</v>
<v Speaker 1>who played three and four sports growing</v>

1250
00:56:23.951 --> 00:56:24.220
<v Speaker 1>up</v>

1251
00:56:24.550 --> 00:56:28.510
<v Speaker 3>and then they get to a certain age and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then they start narrowing in and kind of</v>

1252
00:56:28.511 --> 00:56:30.850
<v Speaker 3>defining the best way to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are they going to do?</v>

1253
00:56:31.240 --> 00:56:33.620
<v Speaker 3>The Australians did it before the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Olympics in [inaudible].</v>

1254
00:56:34.120 --> 00:56:36.850
<v Speaker 3>They started to take it a whole bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 3>metrics on their athletes finding,</v>

1255
00:56:36.851 --> 00:56:41.851
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not good enough to win a medal </v>

1256
00:56:41.851 --> 00:56:41.851
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you thought about this?</v>

1257
00:56:41.851 --> 00:56:41.851
<v Speaker 3>Try this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And as a result,</v>

1258
00:56:41.851 --> 00:56:44.320
<v Speaker 3>the Ozzies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've won national governing body for,</v>

1259
00:56:44.830 --> 00:56:46.870
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for their Olympic sports development.</v>

1260
00:56:47.020 --> 00:56:49.240
<v Speaker 3>As a result,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they did 10 times per capita.</v>

1261
00:56:49.420 --> 00:56:53.410
<v Speaker 3>The amount of metals at the US did in </v>
<v Speaker 3>2012.</v>

1262
00:56:53.860 --> 00:56:55.540
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

1263
00:56:55.720 --> 00:56:57.310
<v Speaker 3>in the UK,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they did the same thing.</v>

1264
00:56:57.311 --> 00:57:01.000
<v Speaker 3>They took it a little bit further as an </v>
<v Speaker 3>example of one woman who was good,</v>

1265
00:57:01.120 --> 00:57:06.120
<v Speaker 3>I think she was some type of distance </v>
<v Speaker 3>runner or something that all sorts of </v>

1266
00:57:06.120 --> 00:57:06.120
<v Speaker 3>measurements,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the,</v>

1267
00:57:06.370 --> 00:57:08.020
<v Speaker 3>the risk to elbow measurement.</v>

1268
00:57:08.020 --> 00:57:09.820
<v Speaker 3>And this is more technical than than I </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

1269
00:57:09.821 --> 00:57:12.460
<v Speaker 3>but they found she had this certain </v>
<v Speaker 3>measurement in here and said,</v>

1270
00:57:12.461 --> 00:57:13.900
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not gonna win a medal on this.</v>

1271
00:57:13.901 --> 00:57:15.550
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever considered rowing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>She goes,</v>

1272
00:57:15.551 --> 00:57:20.551
<v Speaker 3>I've never done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wrote three years later she was Olympic </v>

1273
00:57:20.551 --> 00:57:20.551
<v Speaker 3>champion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's,</v>

1274
00:57:20.551 --> 00:57:24.830
<v Speaker 3>you could be at a little bit rowing </v>
<v Speaker 3>champion three years thinking about if </v>

1275
00:57:24.830 --> 00:57:25.130
<v Speaker 3>you are already a well trained athlete </v>
<v Speaker 3>for something else.</v>

1276
00:57:25.131 --> 00:57:27.340
<v Speaker 3>It involved that type of cardiovascular </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>

1277
00:57:27.420 --> 00:57:30.970
<v Speaker 3>Then you have this specific biomechanics</v>
<v Speaker 3>that fits.</v>

1278
00:57:30.971 --> 00:57:35.971
<v Speaker 3>So if you know what those biomechanics </v>
<v Speaker 3>or you know what to look for in an </v>

1279
00:57:35.971 --> 00:57:36.280
<v Speaker 3>athlete,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can steer them in this direction.</v>

1280
00:57:36.281 --> 00:57:39.730
<v Speaker 3>The UK did great with metal counts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's amazing.</v>

1281
00:57:39.760 --> 00:57:42.130
<v Speaker 3>So I take the same approach.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've always done this.</v>

1282
00:57:42.490 --> 00:57:44.110
<v Speaker 3>I was never.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wrestled in college,</v>

1283
00:57:44.111 --> 00:57:46.270
<v Speaker 3>but I was never.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was never like Dan,</v>

1284
00:57:46.690 --> 00:57:48.970
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was never a great in one thing,</v>

1285
00:57:48.971 --> 00:57:53.971
<v Speaker 3>but I was always really good and I think</v>
<v Speaker 3>it'll lava came from my chiropractic </v>

1286
00:57:53.971 --> 00:57:54.460
<v Speaker 3>background and really looking at </v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody figuring out,</v>

1287
00:57:54.461 --> 00:57:56.020
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's what's going on with you.</v>

1288
00:57:56.260 --> 00:57:57.880
<v Speaker 3>Finally we communicate with them and </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying,</v>

1289
00:57:57.881 --> 00:58:02.881
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think this is the best course of </v>

1290
00:58:02.881 --> 00:58:02.881
<v Speaker 3>action for you based on all these </v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

1291
00:58:02.881 --> 00:58:03.080
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I live now.</v>

1292
00:58:03.081 --> 00:58:04.960
<v Speaker 3>I had trained a little bit with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love the rubber card,</v>

1293
00:58:04.961 --> 00:58:09.961
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But for someone like Dan who's got a </v>

1294
00:58:09.961 --> 00:58:12.781
<v Speaker 3>long torso,</v>
<v Speaker 3>zero flexibility and a great wrestling </v>

1295
00:58:12.781 --> 00:58:16.201
<v Speaker 3>with a sledge hammer right hand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>should we invest time and energy on </v>

1296
00:58:16.201 --> 00:58:18.940
<v Speaker 3>learning a rubber guard?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Probably not the best strategy for them.</v>

1297
00:58:18.941 --> 00:58:23.941
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's other approaches because to get </v>

1298
00:58:23.941 --> 00:58:23.941
<v Speaker 3>good at it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to put all this energy.</v>

1299
00:58:23.941 --> 00:58:27.400
<v Speaker 3>Pat was another great example for him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was heavy punching,</v>

1300
00:58:27.401 --> 00:58:32.401
<v Speaker 3>great wrestling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we're not going to spend a whole lot </v>

1301
00:58:32.401 --> 00:58:32.590
<v Speaker 3>of time at age two pets,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe 30 years old.</v>

1302
00:58:32.591 --> 00:58:35.920
<v Speaker 3>We can't spend a whole lot of time </v>
<v Speaker 3>working at tax from your back.</v>

1303
00:58:36.320 --> 00:58:38.650
<v Speaker 3>He has shorter legs and he's a bitch.</v>

1304
00:58:38.950 --> 00:58:40.870
<v Speaker 3>I've never seen him and be able to hold </v>
<v Speaker 3>him down.</v>

1305
00:58:41.290 --> 00:58:43.210
<v Speaker 3>So where do you invest his time and </v>
<v Speaker 3>energy?</v>

1306
00:58:43.211 --> 00:58:46.000
<v Speaker 3>It comes back to the whole thing and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>amazed that we don't have enough time.</v>

1307
00:58:46.470 --> 00:58:47.560
<v Speaker 3>All this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't have enough time.</v>

1308
00:58:47.561 --> 00:58:52.360
<v Speaker 3>You have to now pick and choose,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the more information you have to kind</v>

1309
00:58:52.361 --> 00:58:54.490
<v Speaker 3>of make those decisions and help funnel </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone,</v>

1310
00:58:54.491 --> 00:58:56.920
<v Speaker 3>you can speed up an athlete's </v>
<v Speaker 3>development considerably.</v>

1311
00:58:57.100 --> 00:58:59.320
<v Speaker 3>If you're stuck in a training room,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go to a big mega,</v>

1312
00:58:59.350 --> 00:59:04.350
<v Speaker 3>mega camp with 70 fighters or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not going to get the quality of </v>

1313
00:59:04.350 --> 00:59:08.140
<v Speaker 3>attention from coaches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're coming up and you learn the </v>

1314
00:59:08.140 --> 00:59:11.041
<v Speaker 3>techniques that everyone else is doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not learning the techniques that </v>

1315
00:59:11.041 --> 00:59:11.041
<v Speaker 3>are best for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In theory,</v>

1316
00:59:11.130 --> 00:59:13.230
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of guys that are saying </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1317
00:59:13.231 --> 00:59:13.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

1318
00:59:13.941 --> 00:59:16.950
<v Speaker 2>they're switching camps because they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying that the camp that they're at,</v>

1319
00:59:16.980 --> 00:59:20.250
<v Speaker 2>they don't get enough attention and when</v>
<v Speaker 2>they spar it's just wars.</v>

1320
00:59:20.380 --> 00:59:22.100
<v Speaker 2>No one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one's being real tactical.</v>

1321
00:59:22.100 --> 00:59:23.750
<v Speaker 1>Do you see that a lot?</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the time.</v>

1322
00:59:24.780 --> 00:59:25.500
<v Speaker 1>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1323
00:59:25.600 --> 00:59:29.240
<v Speaker 1>really I can watch it one time in one </v>
<v Speaker 1>training session,</v>

1324
00:59:29.630 --> 00:59:34.630
<v Speaker 1>three or four people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've always had a really small group of </v>

1325
00:59:34.630 --> 00:59:37.751
<v Speaker 1>people who have had success moving </v>
<v Speaker 1>people up quickly and helping them </v>

1326
00:59:37.751 --> 00:59:40.250
<v Speaker 1>become really good at what they do by </v>
<v Speaker 1>taking this approach.</v>

1327
00:59:40.280 --> 00:59:45.280
<v Speaker 1>And if I had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I was managing 40 people where I was </v>

1328
00:59:45.280 --> 00:59:47.060
<v Speaker 1>at an event once I heard this one guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a pretty well known fighter go,</v>

1329
00:59:47.360 --> 00:59:52.360
<v Speaker 1>I tell my managers all time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just think about me for one minute a </v>

1330
00:59:52.360 --> 00:59:52.850
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I turned to him and said,</v>

1331
00:59:52.851 --> 00:59:54.670
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I better very careful what you ask for.</v>

1332
00:59:54.690 --> 00:59:56.030
<v Speaker 1>She just may get that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1333
00:59:56.480 --> 01:00:01.480
<v Speaker 1>my theory is this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to ask somebody to go </v>

1334
01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:04.661
<v Speaker 1>get in their underwear and fight in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>cage for their money to pay their rent </v>

1335
01:00:04.661 --> 01:00:05.630
<v Speaker 1>that month,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that person deserves a lot of attention,</v>

1336
01:00:08.490 --> 01:00:13.490
<v Speaker 1>especially if if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if my income comes with their success </v>

1337
01:00:13.490 --> 01:00:13.850
<v Speaker 1>and I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh hey,</v>

1338
01:00:13.851 --> 01:00:16.040
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to sit here and you're gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go in the cage and fight.</v>

1339
01:00:16.340 --> 01:00:18.950
<v Speaker 1>You deserve every.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything that I can give you.</v>

1340
01:00:19.100 --> 01:00:22.820
<v Speaker 1>That's what you deserve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's hard for people to find someone</v>

1341
01:00:22.821 --> 01:00:27.821
<v Speaker 1>like you that's willing to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's not that many of you guys out </v>

1342
01:00:27.821 --> 01:00:31.391
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of guys that are doing it </v>

1343
01:00:31.391 --> 01:00:33.080
<v Speaker 1>with all due respect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they're doing a cursory job.</v>

1344
01:00:33.140 --> 01:00:33.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1345
01:00:33.590 --> 01:00:38.590
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you want becoming a manager and </v>

1346
01:00:38.590 --> 01:00:38.590
<v Speaker 1>Emma May now go up to any fighter and </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

1347
01:00:38.590 --> 01:00:41.270
<v Speaker 1>I can get you a bunch of sponsorships </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they'll immediately sign with you.</v>

1348
01:00:41.271 --> 01:00:44.060
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no big picture thought to what's</v>

1349
01:00:44.061 --> 01:00:49.061
<v Speaker 1>being done in 95% of these guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot like being a young standup </v>

1350
01:00:49.061 --> 01:00:53.560
<v Speaker 1>comedians that you're starving and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're looking for someone to come </v>

1351
01:00:53.560 --> 01:00:56.321
<v Speaker 1>along.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to alleviate some of that </v>

1352
01:00:56.321 --> 01:00:56.321
<v Speaker 1>financial pressure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we're going to get you gigs.</v>

1353
01:00:56.321 --> 01:00:57.710
<v Speaker 1>I get you sponsors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get your fights.</v>

1354
01:00:57.890 --> 01:01:01.750
<v Speaker 1>I can get you into bellator or UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can get you into the TFA.</v>

1355
01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:03.280
<v Speaker 1>Whatever the fuck you gonna fight in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1356
01:01:03.950 --> 01:01:08.950
<v Speaker 1>That's a big thing is like these young </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighters that are just fucking barely </v>

1357
01:01:08.950 --> 01:01:12.821
<v Speaker 1>hanging on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're barely making ends meet and </v>

1358
01:01:12.821 --> 01:01:14.981
<v Speaker 1>someone comes along and they're smooth </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk and then they got to get rid of </v>

1359
01:01:14.981 --> 01:01:18.611
<v Speaker 1>those fuckers when things go good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The chance to have that guy or or </v>

1360
01:01:18.611 --> 01:01:21.220
<v Speaker 1>whoever developing you to have longterm </v>
<v Speaker 1>success in your careers.</v>

1361
01:01:21.230 --> 01:01:26.230
<v Speaker 1>It's virtually slim to none.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Evan will be in the old ticket </v>

1362
01:01:26.230 --> 01:01:26.230
<v Speaker 1>commission check a commission check </v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

1363
01:01:26.230 --> 01:01:31.060
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's a bad business decision for </v>
<v Speaker 1>me is probably ways to make more money </v>

1364
01:01:31.060 --> 01:01:34.601
<v Speaker 1>by by having 40 people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there was not to be excellent and </v>

1365
01:01:34.601 --> 01:01:35.660
<v Speaker 1>we're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're here to win championships.</v>

1366
01:01:35.690 --> 01:01:40.690
<v Speaker 1>If you ever see me in the corner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you ever see me working with someone </v>

1367
01:01:40.690 --> 01:01:40.690
<v Speaker 1>because I expect them to go win that </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight in my heart,</v>

1368
01:01:40.690 --> 01:01:42.440
<v Speaker 1>I believe that they're going to go win </v>
<v Speaker 1>that fight or us.</v>

1369
01:01:42.830 --> 01:01:47.180
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't be there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You advise coming to take the fight with</v>

1370
01:01:47.181 --> 01:01:49.040
<v Speaker 1>cormier that had to be a fight where </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

1371
01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:52.070
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a tricky one.</v>

1372
01:01:52.071 --> 01:01:54.460
<v Speaker 1>It was like seven days notice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1373
01:01:54.790 --> 01:01:59.790
<v Speaker 1>are all tricky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got most are like that and dreaming </v>

1374
01:01:59.790 --> 01:02:00.260
<v Speaker 1>Sengoku as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I create a bidding war between dream and</v>

1375
01:02:00.261 --> 01:02:05.261
<v Speaker 1>Sango.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Como didn't have anything to his name </v>

1376
01:02:05.261 --> 01:02:05.660
<v Speaker 1>and he fought for a huge person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he was good for awhile after that</v>

1377
01:02:05.661 --> 01:02:07.340
<v Speaker 1>one fight and it went really well for </v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

1378
01:02:07.580 --> 01:02:12.580
<v Speaker 1>He went and knocked out travis view in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>minute or two and it started his whole </v>

1379
01:02:12.580 --> 01:02:15.500
<v Speaker 1>career with pat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pat was is probably the most challenging</v>

1380
01:02:15.740 --> 01:02:20.040
<v Speaker 1>experience you've had with somebody </v>
<v Speaker 1>because from the time</v>

1381
01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:22.050
<v Speaker 3>I started working with him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people knew he was good.</v>

1382
01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:27.560
<v Speaker 3>Like I saw him spar gifts to us in three</v>
<v Speaker 3>weeks before Jon Jones and pat was six </v>

1383
01:02:27.560 --> 01:02:29.250
<v Speaker 3>weeks off of minor knee injury and I saw</v>
<v Speaker 3>how that one,</v>

1384
01:02:29.580 --> 01:02:32.190
<v Speaker 3>if you've ever found anyone who's </v>
<v Speaker 3>trained with pet companies went,</v>

1385
01:02:32.191 --> 01:02:35.460
<v Speaker 3>oh boy nightmares.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just fucking savage.</v>

1386
01:02:35.461 --> 01:02:40.090
<v Speaker 3>He is so good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he saw the kingsbury fight,</v>

1387
01:02:40.590 --> 01:02:43.070
<v Speaker 3>Kingsbury fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to see what is really keeping.</v>

1388
01:02:43.080 --> 01:02:45.180
<v Speaker 3>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was 50% of him.</v>

1389
01:02:45.270 --> 01:02:50.270
<v Speaker 3>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I still wasn't terribly pleased with </v>

1390
01:02:50.270 --> 01:02:50.270
<v Speaker 3>that performance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was.</v>

1391
01:02:50.270 --> 01:02:51.830
<v Speaker 3>He's so much better than that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a tough fuck.</v>

1392
01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:55.560
<v Speaker 3>He says in Kingsbury was in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not too when he was in there to get by,</v>

1393
01:02:55.561 --> 01:02:57.600
<v Speaker 3>which is hard to finish someone in those</v>
<v Speaker 3>situations,</v>

1394
01:02:57.601 --> 01:02:59.970
<v Speaker 3>but when he was there to win for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>first couple of minutes,</v>

1395
01:03:00.630 --> 01:03:02.460
<v Speaker 3>but in June,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I read some interviews,</v>

1396
01:03:02.461 --> 01:03:02.940
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1397
01:03:02.941 --> 01:03:07.941
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my personal goal here is to get through </v>

1398
01:03:07.941 --> 01:03:07.941
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

1399
01:03:07.941 --> 01:03:07.941
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to smash this guy.</v>

1400
01:03:07.941 --> 01:03:12.600
<v Speaker 3>Was it different mentality?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had done a few IOWASCA sessions and </v>

1401
01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:15.900
<v Speaker 3>that sort of changed his whole outlook </v>
<v Speaker 3>on life,</v>

1402
01:03:16.430 --> 01:03:21.430
<v Speaker 3>kind of become a very different person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something happens to crossover to the </v>

1403
01:03:21.430 --> 01:03:22.770
<v Speaker 3>other side.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1404
01:03:22.860 --> 01:03:26.580
<v Speaker 3>Especially if you're a guy who's made a </v>
<v Speaker 3>living being a savage,</v>

1405
01:03:27.030 --> 01:03:32.030
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then all of a sudden it's difficult </v>

1406
01:03:32.030 --> 01:03:32.030
<v Speaker 3>to continue for long periods of time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1407
01:03:32.030 --> 01:03:34.230
<v Speaker 3>So pat got the call and I got the whole </v>
<v Speaker 3>story was true.</v>

1408
01:03:34.550 --> 01:03:39.550
<v Speaker 3>I had 50 guys turned him down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It got to the point where I'm offering </v>

1409
01:03:39.550 --> 01:03:42.030
<v Speaker 3>promoters like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how much do I have to pay you to get him</v>

1410
01:03:42.031 --> 01:03:47.031
<v Speaker 3>a fight?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the best stories is one promoter on </v>

1411
01:03:47.031 --> 01:03:47.031
<v Speaker 3>the east coast said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1412
01:03:47.031 --> 01:03:49.560
<v Speaker 3>I'm want sign him to a fight deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

1413
01:03:49.561 --> 01:03:54.561
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you have to get me a hundred </v>

1414
01:03:54.561 --> 01:03:54.561
<v Speaker 3>tickets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So how much are the tickets?</v>

1415
01:03:54.561 --> 01:03:55.170
<v Speaker 3>$30.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

1416
01:03:55.171 --> 01:03:57.630
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she want me to pay you $3,000</v>

1417
01:03:57.631 --> 01:03:58.470
<v Speaker 3>every time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pat Fights.</v>

1418
01:03:58.471 --> 01:04:03.471
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll pay that and you have to pay for </v>

1419
01:04:03.471 --> 01:04:03.471
<v Speaker 3>your travel and hotel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So now we're just laughing.</v>

1420
01:04:03.471 --> 01:04:06.390
<v Speaker 3>So now that will cause it to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wanted exclusive deal.</v>

1421
01:04:06.391 --> 01:04:09.780
<v Speaker 3>I have to pay him $15,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>to sign pat to an exclusive deal.</v>

1422
01:04:09.800 --> 01:04:14.800
<v Speaker 3>It's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even that guy couldn't find them in </v>

1423
01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:14.800
<v Speaker 3>upon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1424
01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:16.170
<v Speaker 3>So you agree to this and saw I'm not </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to do that,</v>

1425
01:04:16.171 --> 01:04:21.171
<v Speaker 3>but I still will find us an opponent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course you'd never had anybody and </v>

1426
01:04:21.171 --> 01:04:21.840
<v Speaker 3>that's a hilarious deal though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That W,</v>

1427
01:04:21.841 --> 01:04:23.250
<v Speaker 3>W,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pat and I were laughing.</v>

1428
01:04:23.251 --> 01:04:26.610
<v Speaker 3>Can you say what organization or member </v>
<v Speaker 3>three letters on the east coast.</v>

1429
01:04:26.611 --> 01:04:29.820
<v Speaker 3>I have no idea what the letters mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we were going everywhere.</v>

1430
01:04:29.850 --> 01:04:31.870
<v Speaker 3>I mean if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you were.</v>

1431
01:04:32.420 --> 01:04:33.330
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was trying,</v>

1432
01:04:33.331 --> 01:04:36.390
<v Speaker 3>I would try to find opponents for him </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then set him up for,</v>

1433
01:04:36.630 --> 01:04:38.130
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have an opponent,</v>

1434
01:04:38.250 --> 01:04:39.690
<v Speaker 3>here's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this will pay for all this.</v>

1435
01:04:39.710 --> 01:04:42.570
<v Speaker 3>No one wanted to fight pet coming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we got the call.</v>

1436
01:04:43.580 --> 01:04:46.680
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a whole mad rush at this point,</v>

1437
01:04:46.980 --> 01:04:51.980
<v Speaker 3>three weeks early,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had started working at this coffee </v>

1438
01:04:51.980 --> 01:04:54.261
<v Speaker 3>shop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he's getting up at two in the </v>

1439
01:04:54.261 --> 01:04:54.261
<v Speaker 3>morning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to the coffee shop,</v>

1440
01:04:54.261 --> 01:04:56.550
<v Speaker 3>training,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sleeping five hours a night.</v>

1441
01:04:56.551 --> 01:05:00.210
<v Speaker 3>This went on for three weeks and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>barged into the coffee shop and said,</v>

1442
01:05:00.211 --> 01:05:02.190
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dan is on the phone.</v>

1443

<v Speaker 3>And he goes,</v>

1444
01:05:04.710 --> 01:05:05.970
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>

1445
01:05:06.090 --> 01:05:11.040
<v Speaker 3>And that's how everything got going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we've got to quit.</v>

1446
01:05:11.070 --> 01:05:13.040
<v Speaker 3>The job,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they didn't want to talk on that</v>

1447
01:05:13.070 --> 01:05:14.460
<v Speaker 3>until they told me he was fire.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They said,</v>

1448
01:05:14.461 --> 01:05:15.680
<v Speaker 3>pack your stuff and go home.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1449
01:05:15.740 --> 01:05:16.320
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>see,</v>

1450
01:05:17.040 --> 01:05:21.040
<v Speaker 3>and then literally 12 hours later,</v>
<v Speaker 3>10 hours later,</v>

1451
01:05:21.190 --> 01:05:26.190
<v Speaker 3>he's live on Fox talking shit to Daniel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hadn't.</v>

1452
01:05:26.831 --> 01:05:29.050
<v Speaker 3>Hadn't slept in 24 hours and then.</v>

1453
01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:34.200
<v Speaker 3>But here's what people don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People don't understand all the see all </v>

1454
01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:34.570
<v Speaker 3>the behind the scenes stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that was the day.</v>

1455
01:05:34.571 --> 01:05:36.010
<v Speaker 3>So 24 hours,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no sleep,</v>

1456
01:05:36.011 --> 01:05:38.110
<v Speaker 3>and then we have to do all of your </v>
<v Speaker 3>medicals in a day.</v>

1457
01:05:38.111 --> 01:05:40.810
<v Speaker 3>That's a huge task and there's a whole </v>
<v Speaker 3>bunch of media.</v>

1458
01:05:41.020 --> 01:05:44.470
<v Speaker 3>Try to work some training in there and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then couple days later we're on.</v>

1459
01:05:44.740 --> 01:05:45.880
<v Speaker 3>I think I have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's four nights,</v>

1460
01:05:45.881 --> 01:05:50.881
<v Speaker 3>I think I slept two hours a night so </v>
<v Speaker 3>that by the time we get to vegas he's </v>

1461
01:05:50.881 --> 01:05:52.750
<v Speaker 3>super happy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>relaxed but tired.</v>

1462
01:05:53.460 --> 01:05:55.130
<v Speaker 3>And I have this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this picture of this gauge.</v>

1463
01:05:55.131 --> 01:05:57.610
<v Speaker 3>You mentioned a pressure gauge in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>middle of the needles right here.</v>

1464
01:05:57.611 --> 01:05:59.500
<v Speaker 3>This is like we are now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're calm.</v>

1465
01:05:59.501 --> 01:06:01.660
<v Speaker 3>Everything is centered.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The needle goes this way.</v>

1466
01:06:01.661 --> 01:06:05.650
<v Speaker 3>It's all called call negative emotions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like maybe a little worry,</v>

1467
01:06:05.680 --> 01:06:07.120
<v Speaker 3>anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fear,</v>

1468
01:06:07.330 --> 01:06:07.980
<v Speaker 3>panic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1469
01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:09.640
<v Speaker 3>we started to bury into the red section.</v>

1470
01:06:09.640 --> 01:06:13.840
<v Speaker 3>On the other side is all positive </v>
<v Speaker 3>emotions will cost the green side and we</v>

1471
01:06:13.841 --> 01:06:16.150
<v Speaker 3>have like happiness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>joy,</v>

1472
01:06:16.540 --> 01:06:18.110
<v Speaker 3>excitement,</v>
<v Speaker 3>caution,</v>

1473
01:06:18.310 --> 01:06:23.310
<v Speaker 3>confidence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you kind of get to this manic </v>

1474
01:06:23.310 --> 01:06:24.790
<v Speaker 3>like almost right before your fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're so ready to go.</v>

1475
01:06:25.180 --> 01:06:27.340
<v Speaker 3>If your needle is on either side of </v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

1476
01:06:27.550 --> 01:06:31.860
<v Speaker 3>you're burning energy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so even if you get into a sitter,</v>

1477
01:06:31.880 --> 01:06:34.840
<v Speaker 3>impat was super happy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was great.</v>

1478
01:06:34.841 --> 01:06:39.841
<v Speaker 3>The media,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I felt great about things all week </v>

1479
01:06:39.841 --> 01:06:39.841
<v Speaker 3>because he was so relaxed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>feeling good,</v>

1480
01:06:39.841 --> 01:06:41.680
<v Speaker 3>but he was almost feeling too excited </v>
<v Speaker 3>and too happy.</v>

1481
01:06:42.310 --> 01:06:44.170
<v Speaker 3>So wherever that needle is on either </v>
<v Speaker 3>side,</v>

1482
01:06:44.171 --> 01:06:46.180
<v Speaker 3>you're burning energy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then come fight time.</v>

1483
01:06:46.870 --> 01:06:50.680
<v Speaker 3>You haven't slept for three weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've been doing this job.</v>

1484
01:06:50.681 --> 01:06:52.670
<v Speaker 3>All of a sudden you have this huge </v>
<v Speaker 3>adrenaline dress.</v>

1485
01:06:52.671 --> 01:06:53.770
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no one will fight me.</v>

1486
01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:58.510
<v Speaker 3>I'm in the UFC and a co main event.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here we are against Daniel.</v>

1487
01:06:59.140 --> 01:07:02.560
<v Speaker 3>I think what happened in the fight is </v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

1488
01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:05.590
<v Speaker 3>he stopped being a participant in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>became an observer.</v>

1489
01:07:06.430 --> 01:07:08.710
<v Speaker 3>He stepped out of the moment in that </v>
<v Speaker 3>situation,</v>

1490
01:07:08.711 --> 01:07:11.350
<v Speaker 3>so it was just overwhelmed by it or the </v>
<v Speaker 3>whole thing.</v>

1491
01:07:11.380 --> 01:07:12.580
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but not overwhelmed.</v>

1492
01:07:12.581 --> 01:07:15.280
<v Speaker 3>Like in the sense that it was too much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You didn't want to be there.</v>

1493
01:07:15.400 --> 01:07:17.290
<v Speaker 3>There's different types of overwhelmed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1494
01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:20.890
<v Speaker 3>He had just expanded so much energy that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want.</v>

1495
01:07:20.891 --> 01:07:25.891
<v Speaker 3>You only have so much energy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can only push so hard even if it's </v>

1496
01:07:25.891 --> 01:07:25.891
<v Speaker 3>all really good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>positive things.</v>

1497
01:07:25.891 --> 01:07:27.670
<v Speaker 3>If you have all these amazing things </v>
<v Speaker 3>happening in your life,</v>

1498
01:07:27.671 --> 01:07:32.230
<v Speaker 3>you still have to take a breath,</v>
<v Speaker 3>return to center.</v>

1499
01:07:32.231 --> 01:07:34.090
<v Speaker 3>It's like if you take a pendulum,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you hold it up,</v>

1500
01:07:34.091 --> 01:07:37.540
<v Speaker 3>it's going to swing wildly for awhile </v>
<v Speaker 3>before it settles back down again.</v>

1501
01:07:37.780 --> 01:07:39.160
<v Speaker 3>Your job,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're going to do,</v>

1502
01:07:39.161 --> 01:07:40.330
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1503
01:07:40.360 --> 01:07:45.360
<v Speaker 3>be involved with the sport like this is </v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to keep super centered and </v>

1504
01:07:45.360 --> 01:07:45.360
<v Speaker 3>focused.</v>

1505
01:07:45.360 --> 01:07:45.360
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1506
01:07:45.360 --> 01:07:46.390
<v Speaker 3>I won a bunch of money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1507
01:07:46.660 --> 01:07:47.710
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just lost the fight.</v>

1508
01:07:47.711 --> 01:07:49.660
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the guy who is best at this,</v>

1509
01:07:49.661 --> 01:07:51.730
<v Speaker 3>I think just naturally personality wise </v>
<v Speaker 3>was Dan.</v>

1510
01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:54.670
<v Speaker 3>Dan was always right here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're in a big fight.</v>

1511
01:07:55.240 --> 01:07:55.960
<v Speaker 3>Lose something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1512
01:07:56.140 --> 01:07:58.210
<v Speaker 3>feel Dan could win $1 million.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It okay,</v>

1513
01:07:58.270 --> 01:08:03.270
<v Speaker 3>just a little bump up and really be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was always very centered Lavonne and </v>

1514
01:08:03.270 --> 01:08:06.340
<v Speaker 3>I think that's one reason why he was so </v>
<v Speaker 3>successful that pat is also like that,</v>

1515
01:08:06.341 --> 01:08:11.341
<v Speaker 3>but he was just thrown into this </v>
<v Speaker 3>environment where there was so much </v>

1516
01:08:11.341 --> 01:08:13.600
<v Speaker 3>energy being spent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>By the time he came into the fight,</v>

1517
01:08:14.020 --> 01:08:15.860
<v Speaker 3>it was difficult to to involved with </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1518
01:08:15.861 --> 01:08:15.990
<v Speaker 3>Now</v>

1519
01:08:16.130 --> 01:08:18.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that he would have one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Daniel was clearly the better fighter.</v>

1520
01:08:18.801 --> 01:08:20.000
<v Speaker 1>Don't misunderstand what I'm saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

1521
01:08:20.001 --> 01:08:23.210
<v Speaker 1>but you have to kind of look at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole arc of,</v>

1522
01:08:23.410 --> 01:08:27.080
<v Speaker 1>of this experience and not only just </v>
<v Speaker 1>with fight week,</v>

1523
01:08:27.290 --> 01:08:29.990
<v Speaker 1>you have to take that same overall view </v>
<v Speaker 1>of your career.</v>

1524
01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:32.720
<v Speaker 1>So if you're a young fighter and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>struggling,</v>

1525
01:08:32.721 --> 01:08:33.530
<v Speaker 1>that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1526
01:08:33.531 --> 01:08:34.760
<v Speaker 1>struggle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>worried about how you're gonna,</v>

1527
01:08:34.850 --> 01:08:36.290
<v Speaker 1>pay your rent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not a bad thing.</v>

1528
01:08:37.130 --> 01:08:42.130
<v Speaker 1>You have to look at everything that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing and the bigger picture of </v>

1529
01:08:42.130 --> 01:08:42.130
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for me,</v>

1530
01:08:42.130 --> 01:08:45.791
<v Speaker 1>the bigger pictures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we want to go win championships in the </v>

1531
01:08:45.791 --> 01:08:45.791
<v Speaker 1>UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is the whole goal.</v>

1532
01:08:45.800 --> 01:08:48.830
<v Speaker 1>Anything less than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go do something else.</v>

1533
01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:52.460
<v Speaker 1>Don't risk this type of lifestyle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is not your intent.</v>

1534
01:08:53.390 --> 01:08:55.010
<v Speaker 1>How many different guys you're working </v>
<v Speaker 1>with now?</v>

1535
01:08:56.210 --> 01:08:58.730
<v Speaker 1>I have three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I managed three fighters in the UFC.</v>

1536
01:08:58.790 --> 01:08:59.600
<v Speaker 1>Pat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1537
01:08:59.601 --> 01:09:02.090
<v Speaker 1>Dennis Bermudez who's fighting the </v>
<v Speaker 1>animal.</v>

1538
01:09:02.180 --> 01:09:03.050
<v Speaker 1>Oh boy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

1539
01:09:03.230 --> 01:09:05.890
<v Speaker 1>the most exciting fighter in the UFC </v>
<v Speaker 1>that no one talks about.</v>

1540
01:09:07.100 --> 01:09:08.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm confused.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1541
01:09:08.200 --> 01:09:12.760
<v Speaker 1>when did the hundred 45 pound title </v>
<v Speaker 1>picture gets sorted out.</v>

1542
01:09:12.761 --> 01:09:16.220
<v Speaker 1>Nobody starts talking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's talking about cobb and wow.</v>

1543
01:09:16.430 --> 01:09:21.160
<v Speaker 1>Come conor mcgregor didn't get Dennis </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bermudez for this.</v>

1544
01:09:21.161 --> 01:09:23.700
<v Speaker 1>A big Boston fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is he fighting Dennis seaver?</v>

1545
01:09:23.740 --> 01:09:25.970
<v Speaker 1>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think stylistically it's better.</v>

1546
01:09:26.060 --> 01:09:29.760
<v Speaker 1>They want to keep winning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So match them up with a striker.</v>

1547
01:09:30.380 --> 01:09:32.450
<v Speaker 1>Who knows how to dig into.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a striker.</v>

1548
01:09:32.510 --> 01:09:34.070
<v Speaker 1>He's a striker and a wrestler.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1549
01:09:34.071 --> 01:09:37.610
<v Speaker 1>but Dennis strikings fucking Dennis is </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably have mma,</v>

1550
01:09:37.611 --> 01:09:40.700
<v Speaker 1>wrestling and mma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Him and pat are are right up there.</v>

1551
01:09:40.790 --> 01:09:42.980
<v Speaker 1>I mean Dennis is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dennis is a nightmare.</v>

1552
01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:45.200
<v Speaker 1>Who's the fucking savage?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so exciting.</v>

1553
01:09:45.201 --> 01:09:50.201
<v Speaker 1>Good luck to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hispanic then this is going to be </v>

1554
01:09:50.201 --> 01:09:50.201
<v Speaker 1>dentists can be cheeky.</v>

1555
01:09:50.201 --> 01:09:50.420
<v Speaker 1>I expected it to be champion and 12 </v>
<v Speaker 1>months.</v>

1556
01:09:50.780 --> 01:09:55.780
<v Speaker 1>Well I'm just A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a weird one to be cause he's like </v>

1557
01:09:55.780 --> 01:09:59.151
<v Speaker 1>this like a dark horse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he's the guy that people just are </v>

1558
01:09:59.151 --> 01:09:59.990
<v Speaker 1>not talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't understand it.</v>

1559
01:10:00.440 --> 01:10:05.440
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think there's a legitimate </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason when people were talking about </v>

1560
01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:05.440
<v Speaker 1>cub,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Swanson and Frankie Uyghur and obviously</v>

1561
01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:07.280
<v Speaker 1>a legitimate reason why people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about conor.</v>

1562
01:10:07.490 --> 01:10:10.400
<v Speaker 1>Several reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Charisma and skill,</v>

1563
01:10:10.430 --> 01:10:11.430
<v Speaker 1>you know all those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got the.</v>

1564
01:10:11.510 --> 01:10:13.010
<v Speaker 1>In fact he's got it all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1565
01:10:13.310 --> 01:10:18.310
<v Speaker 1>but Bermudez is a fucking savage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's never lost in the FC except for </v>

1566
01:10:18.310 --> 01:10:19.710
<v Speaker 1>that one fight with Diego Brandao every </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>

1567
01:10:19.711 --> 01:10:22.370
<v Speaker 1>Since then he's won and he's looked </v>
<v Speaker 1>better every time he's been out there.</v>

1568
01:10:22.400 --> 01:10:25.040
<v Speaker 1>On top of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's won five performance bonuses.</v>

1569
01:10:25.400 --> 01:10:28.910
<v Speaker 1>These single most exciting fighter in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the entire UFC.</v>

1570
01:10:28.940 --> 01:10:30.170
<v Speaker 1>So what the fuck is going on?</v>

1571
01:10:30.350 --> 01:10:33.080
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it takes a while to catch on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it is?</v>

1572
01:10:33.140 --> 01:10:34.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1573
01:10:34.220 --> 01:10:36.590
<v Speaker 1>once they finally do catch on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

1574
01:10:36.591 --> 01:10:41.591
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's go back and watch his other </v>

1575
01:10:41.591 --> 01:10:41.591
<v Speaker 1>fights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1576
01:10:41.591 --> 01:10:43.681
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Within six months he's going to be a </v>

1577
01:10:43.681 --> 01:10:44.450
<v Speaker 1>huge star in the UFC and it's actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't mind it.</v>

1578
01:10:44.451 --> 01:10:46.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm happy for him for it because it lets</v>
<v Speaker 1>them build.</v>

1579
01:10:46.850 --> 01:10:48.410
<v Speaker 1>He need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He needed time.</v>

1580
01:10:48.411 --> 01:10:50.840
<v Speaker 1>He's got great coaching so he the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>down this works.</v>

1581
01:10:50.841 --> 01:10:55.841
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's his home base is on Long Island </v>

1582
01:10:55.841 --> 01:10:58.090
<v Speaker 1>Transit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Long Island in Miami and Belmont </v>

1583
01:10:58.090 --> 01:10:58.090
<v Speaker 1>kickboxing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fantastic coaches.</v>

1584
01:10:58.090 --> 01:11:00.030
<v Speaker 1>They're in good training partners there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He starts his camps out with me and they</v>

1585
01:11:00.050 --> 01:11:05.050
<v Speaker 1>finishes with us out here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what dentists need to work on was </v>

1586
01:11:05.830 --> 01:11:10.830
<v Speaker 1>this to cover new thing I've been doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>over the past couple years is is pacing </v>

1587
01:11:10.830 --> 01:11:13.920
<v Speaker 1>during a fight camp and finding an </v>
<v Speaker 1>athlete's workload,</v>

1588
01:11:13.950 --> 01:11:14.250
<v Speaker 1>that's</v>

1589
01:11:14.250 --> 01:11:19.250
<v Speaker 3>very difficult to do to find out how </v>
<v Speaker 3>much you can push someone when they </v>

1590
01:11:19.250 --> 01:11:20.790
<v Speaker 3>start to pull back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone's not the same,</v>

1591
01:11:20.900 --> 01:11:25.900
<v Speaker 3>so now when guys start camps,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they get from me a schedule of eight </v>

1592
01:11:25.921 --> 01:11:30.921
<v Speaker 3>weeks or however long that we have and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that schedule is broken down in the </v>

1593
01:11:30.921 --> 01:11:34.280
<v Speaker 3>weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are color coded by intensity and also </v>

1594
01:11:34.280 --> 01:11:35.340
<v Speaker 3>all their workouts are plotted out now </v>
<v Speaker 3>that the plans never work out.</v>

1595
01:11:36.280 --> 01:11:37.890
<v Speaker 3>I'm a believer that all plans are </v>
<v Speaker 3>useless,</v>

1596
01:11:37.891 --> 01:11:41.270
<v Speaker 3>but the acting of planning is essential.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's so much that you,</v>

1597
01:11:41.490 --> 01:11:46.490
<v Speaker 3>that you derive from that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they can see how their whole eight </v>

1598
01:11:46.490 --> 01:11:49.821
<v Speaker 3>weeks are going to look.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So Dennis had just took some time to </v>

1599
01:11:49.821 --> 01:11:49.821
<v Speaker 3>find his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his pacing,</v>

1600
01:11:49.821 --> 01:11:51.360
<v Speaker 3>and there's two fights that he.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That he.</v>

1601
01:11:51.390 --> 01:11:56.390
<v Speaker 3>There were real close for them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was Matt grice and maybe </v>

1602
01:11:56.390 --> 01:11:59.280
<v Speaker 3>Holloway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was completely overtrain.</v>

1603
01:11:59.281 --> 01:12:04.281
<v Speaker 3>Coming into those fights,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I realized I had never seen an </v>

1604
01:12:04.281 --> 01:12:04.281
<v Speaker 3>overtrained athlete before.</v>

1605
01:12:04.281 --> 01:12:05.430
<v Speaker 3>Dennis came out and looked at went,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1606
01:12:05.460 --> 01:12:07.980
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was just healthy food,</v>

1607
01:12:08.010 --> 01:12:09.780
<v Speaker 3>ice baths,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some soft tissue work,</v>

1608
01:12:09.781 --> 01:12:11.640
<v Speaker 3>some light movement stuff to get him </v>
<v Speaker 3>back.</v>

1609
01:12:12.150 --> 01:12:16.410
<v Speaker 3>How many days out?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was two and a half weeks out.</v>

1610
01:12:16.590 --> 01:12:18.440
<v Speaker 3>Two and a half weeks ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He knew he was overtrained.</v>

1611
01:12:18.490 --> 01:12:23.490
<v Speaker 3>Oh totally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I realize I realized I had never seen </v>

1612
01:12:23.490 --> 01:12:26.200
<v Speaker 3>the look on his face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want when I was born,</v>

1613
01:12:26.201 --> 01:12:30.720
<v Speaker 3>his energy to what about heart rate?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't am.</v>

1614
01:12:30.721 --> 01:12:32.940
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember if I remember.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was hard.</v>

1615
01:12:32.941 --> 01:12:37.941
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was a more general sense and </v>

1616
01:12:37.941 --> 01:12:37.941
<v Speaker 3>feeling of somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's more,</v>

1617
01:12:37.941 --> 01:12:38.190
<v Speaker 3>you can take heart,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could do all this stuff,</v>

1618
01:12:38.191 --> 01:12:43.191
<v Speaker 3>but the best you can to get is really </v>
<v Speaker 3>looking at someone getting a sense of </v>

1619
01:12:43.191 --> 01:12:43.830
<v Speaker 3>how they feel and that only comes with </v>
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>

1620
01:12:43.860 --> 01:12:48.860
<v Speaker 3>so I have to take some like a year to </v>
<v Speaker 3>really get to know an athlete and for </v>

1621
01:12:48.860 --> 01:12:52.230
<v Speaker 3>them to know me and for us to kind of go</v>
<v Speaker 3>through these ups and downs together.</v>

1622
01:12:52.230 --> 01:12:53.730
<v Speaker 3>That always happened in everyone's </v>
<v Speaker 3>career,</v>

1623
01:12:54.060 --> 01:12:59.060
<v Speaker 3>so that was Dennis has challenge is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is finding his pacing during this camp </v>

1624
01:12:59.060 --> 01:13:02.901
<v Speaker 3>and he's really got that data and we saw</v>
<v Speaker 3>that with clay and he went there and </v>

1625
01:13:02.901 --> 01:13:05.550
<v Speaker 3>smash colleague that not even remotely </v>
<v Speaker 3>competitive and now he's.</v>

1626
01:13:05.640 --> 01:13:09.390
<v Speaker 3>He's coming up again here in a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 3>weeks and who's he fighting llamas.</v>

1627
01:13:09.700 --> 01:13:11.400
<v Speaker 3>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a good fight.</v>

1628
01:13:11.510 --> 01:13:12.730
<v Speaker 3>What if I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are,</v>

1629
01:13:12.740 --> 01:13:14.960
<v Speaker 3>what card is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is the Mexico City cars.</v>

1630
01:13:14.980 --> 01:13:17.050
<v Speaker 3>He's always just under the co main </v>
<v Speaker 3>events.</v>

1631
01:13:17.080 --> 01:13:19.450
<v Speaker 3>The UFC is now pushed him up to that </v>
<v Speaker 3>level.</v>

1632
01:13:19.740 --> 01:13:24.740
<v Speaker 3>He'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he'll start getting lots of attention </v>

1633
01:13:24.740 --> 01:13:24.740
<v Speaker 3>and he's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a guy too.</v>

1634
01:13:24.740 --> 01:13:27.000
<v Speaker 3>That is as tough as any man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it was a thousand years ago.</v>

1635
01:13:27.001 --> 01:13:29.820
<v Speaker 3>Dennis is on the front front line with </v>
<v Speaker 3>an ax in his hand for sure.</v>

1636
01:13:29.821 --> 01:13:33.220
<v Speaker 3>He's legitimate tough guy and he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>smart.</v>

1637
01:13:33.910 --> 01:13:38.910
<v Speaker 3>He's super coachable and he listens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a very rare trait in someone </v>

1638
01:13:38.910 --> 01:13:39.650
<v Speaker 3>who's [inaudible].</v>

1639
01:13:39.660 --> 01:13:44.660
<v Speaker 3>It's usually they go the other way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Usually you win a bunch of fights and </v>

1640
01:13:44.660 --> 01:13:47.151
<v Speaker 3>you stopped doing everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything that you were doing </v>

1641
01:13:47.151 --> 01:13:47.151
<v Speaker 3>beforehand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dennis hasn't taken that approach.</v>

1642
01:13:47.151 --> 01:13:49.770
<v Speaker 3>So for this one we worked with a company</v>
<v Speaker 3>called hypoxic.</v>

1643
01:13:49.771 --> 01:13:54.771
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's been sleeping in an altitude tent </v>

1644
01:13:54.771 --> 01:13:54.771
<v Speaker 3>for the past five weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Simulating the elevation.</v>

1645
01:13:54.820 --> 01:13:57.390
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the highest elevation UFC ever.</v>

1646
01:13:58.170 --> 01:13:59.610
<v Speaker 3>7,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>plus feet.</v>

1647
01:13:59.700 --> 01:14:01.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he has that to,</v>

1648
01:14:01.220 --> 01:14:02.180
<v Speaker 3>to help there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got,</v>

1649
01:14:02.190 --> 01:14:06.110
<v Speaker 3>we use a normatec recovery systems to </v>
<v Speaker 3>help kind of research.</v>

1650
01:14:06.550 --> 01:14:08.590
<v Speaker 3>Let's use compression leg.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1651
01:14:09.290 --> 01:14:10.170
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen those.</v>

1652
01:14:10.230 --> 01:14:11.590
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You were telling me about that,</v>

1653
01:14:11.591 --> 01:14:13.420
<v Speaker 3>but I've seen it on videos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1654
01:14:13.421 --> 01:14:15.730
<v Speaker 3>We've been using those for four years </v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

1655
01:14:15.790 --> 01:14:18.250
<v Speaker 3>It's an.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's it do it basically,</v>

1656
01:14:18.251 --> 01:14:23.251
<v Speaker 3>it helps blood flow back to heart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when your heart squeezes that </v>

1657
01:14:23.251 --> 01:14:23.560
<v Speaker 3>arterial blood is under high pressure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it squeezes,</v>

1658
01:14:23.561 --> 01:14:24.010
<v Speaker 3>it goes down.</v>

1659
01:14:24.010 --> 01:14:25.860
<v Speaker 3>By the time it gets to your venous </v>
<v Speaker 3>system,</v>

1660
01:14:25.880 --> 01:14:27.400
<v Speaker 3>get returned to your heart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's low pressure.</v>

1661
01:14:27.700 --> 01:14:32.700
<v Speaker 3>So there's one way valves in your veins,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and when you walk in your muscles </v>

1662
01:14:32.700 --> 01:14:33.040
<v Speaker 3>squeeze it helps pump the blood back up </v>
<v Speaker 3>again.</v>

1663
01:14:33.041 --> 01:14:34.900
<v Speaker 3>There's a valve to get it back to your </v>
<v Speaker 3>heart.</v>

1664
01:14:35.770 --> 01:14:38.560
<v Speaker 3>With the NORMATEC,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they looked like these big hockey pants.</v>

1665
01:14:38.561 --> 01:14:43.561
<v Speaker 3>It in flight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>starting at your foot and all the way </v>

1666
01:14:43.561 --> 01:14:45.481
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have ones for the arms and the hips </v>

1667
01:14:45.481 --> 01:14:47.071
<v Speaker 3>to and they help squeeze that blood and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the lymphatic system back to your heart </v>

1668
01:14:47.080 --> 01:14:49.270
<v Speaker 3>so you recover quicker and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>incredible.</v>

1669
01:14:49.330 --> 01:14:54.330
<v Speaker 3>You can take two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>three days if you go pump your legs for </v>

1670
01:14:54.330 --> 01:14:54.330
<v Speaker 3>an hour or two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like a day and a half for recovery.</v>

1671
01:14:54.610 --> 01:14:57.400
<v Speaker 3>Really much difference.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Huge difference.</v>

1672
01:14:57.401 --> 01:15:00.070
<v Speaker 3>I go several years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I first got one to test out.</v>

1673
01:15:00.071 --> 01:15:02.260
<v Speaker 3>I squatted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't in great shape.</v>

1674
01:15:02.260 --> 01:15:05.170
<v Speaker 3>I squatted heavy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I ran for an hour and did sprints.</v>

1675
01:15:05.171 --> 01:15:10.171
<v Speaker 3>I should have been wrecked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I pumped for three hours watching a </v>

1676
01:15:10.171 --> 01:15:10.240
<v Speaker 3>movie on the TV at night,</v>
<v Speaker 3>got up the next morning.</v>

1677
01:15:10.241 --> 01:15:13.540
<v Speaker 3>I had no soreness in my legs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My ass was super sore,</v>

1678
01:15:13.660 --> 01:15:16.270
<v Speaker 3>but it didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We didn't have the hip one yet.</v>

1679
01:15:16.271 --> 01:15:18.400
<v Speaker 3>So it only came up to your height to </v>
<v Speaker 3>your thighs?</v>

1680
01:15:18.670 --> 01:15:20.950
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it really made me rethink healing.</v>

1681
01:15:20.951 --> 01:15:23.920
<v Speaker 3>An injury is maybe it's nothing more </v>
<v Speaker 3>than circulation issues.</v>

1682
01:15:24.070 --> 01:15:25.020
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mm hmm.</v>

1683
01:15:26.050 --> 01:15:28.540
<v Speaker 3>What about cryotherapy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you guys mess around with that?</v>

1684
01:15:28.630 --> 01:15:31.180
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we do a cold plunges,</v>

1685
01:15:31.510 --> 01:15:36.510
<v Speaker 3>cold plunges size paths.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you seen those cryo chambers that </v>

1686
01:15:36.510 --> 01:15:37.120
<v Speaker 3>there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been to one.</v>

1687
01:15:37.121 --> 01:15:39.100
<v Speaker 3>We tested it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't get a whole lot out of it.</v>

1688
01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:44.360
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you go to the one that got his neck </v>

1689
01:15:44.360 --> 01:15:44.360
<v Speaker 2>down or the one that you step into your </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole body?</v>

1690
01:15:44.360 --> 01:15:46.380
<v Speaker 2>It's the long as good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've done both.</v>

1691
01:15:46.590 --> 01:15:50.370
<v Speaker 2>The neck down is okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the whole body one is fucking legit.</v>

1692
01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:54.000
<v Speaker 2>Were the one you have to put on a face </v>
<v Speaker 2>mask and your mom haven't done that.</v>

1693
01:15:54.240 --> 01:15:56.820
<v Speaker 2>I want to show you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It will bring it to the place in La.</v>

1694
01:15:56.870 --> 01:15:59.130
<v Speaker 2>Croix healthcare in La is fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>amazing.</v>

1695
01:15:59.131 --> 01:16:01.980
<v Speaker 2>250 degrees below zero and you go in for</v>
<v Speaker 2>three minutes,</v>

1696
01:16:02.130 --> 01:16:04.020
<v Speaker 2>he'd get out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get on an elliptical machine,</v>

1697
01:16:04.021 --> 01:16:09.021
<v Speaker 2>you warm up for like five,</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 minutes and then you go back in for </v>

1698
01:16:09.021 --> 01:16:11.910
<v Speaker 2>another 350 below zero and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it feels like 250 below zero.</v>

1699
01:16:11.911 --> 01:16:13.620
<v Speaker 2>The other ones don't feel like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1700
01:16:13.830 --> 01:16:14.910
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm cold down there,</v>

1701
01:16:14.911 --> 01:16:17.760
<v Speaker 2>but my head's not cold so it's not that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just not the same,</v>

1702
01:16:18.150 --> 01:16:22.590
<v Speaker 2>but this one when you get out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once you get out of it,</v>

1703
01:16:22.591 --> 01:16:25.260
<v Speaker 2>it's like your whole body just like </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking electrical.</v>

1704
01:16:25.261 --> 01:16:29.220
<v Speaker 2>It's like things are crackling because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you know your skin is 39 degrees.</v>

1705
01:16:29.221 --> 01:16:32.000
<v Speaker 2>I mean you're on the verge of dying and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then what?</v>

1706
01:16:32.940 --> 01:16:35.480
<v Speaker 3>Go back until you have to do things like</v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

1707
01:16:35.520 --> 01:16:38.870
<v Speaker 3>Recovery is completely overlooked in </v>
<v Speaker 3>this sport.</v>

1708
01:16:38.871 --> 01:16:43.871
<v Speaker 3>I think subway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>overtraining is rampant and recovery is </v>

1709
01:16:43.871 --> 01:16:43.871
<v Speaker 3>not nearly what it needs to.</v>

1710
01:16:43.871 --> 01:16:43.871
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is a.</v>

1711
01:16:43.871 --> 01:16:46.430
<v Speaker 2>that's an issue with amateur wrestling </v>
<v Speaker 2>as well,</v>

1712
01:16:46.490 --> 01:16:47.870
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean amateur wrestling,</v>

1713
01:16:48.200 --> 01:16:49.460
<v Speaker 2>almost all the athletes over</v>

1714
01:16:49.510 --> 01:16:51.600
<v Speaker 3>trained.</v>
<v Speaker 3>By the time I was 21,</v>

1715
01:16:51.601 --> 01:16:53.310
<v Speaker 3>I was done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My neck was so messed up.</v>

1716
01:16:53.311 --> 01:16:55.830
<v Speaker 3>I was finished.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1717
01:16:55.831 --> 01:16:58.210
<v Speaker 3>I mean amateur wrestling is also.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're also 18,</v>

1718
01:16:58.211 --> 01:16:58.980
<v Speaker 3>19,</v>
<v Speaker 3>20,</v>

1719
01:16:58.981 --> 01:16:59.530
<v Speaker 3>20,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1720
01:16:59.760 --> 01:17:02.520
<v Speaker 3>you can do a lot of things at that age.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So here,</v>

1721
01:17:02.521 --> 01:17:05.190
<v Speaker 3>here's my warm up at 19.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ready.</v>

1722
01:17:05.340 --> 01:17:07.410
<v Speaker 3>Let's go as a 19 year old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>warm up.</v>

1723
01:17:07.411 --> 01:17:12.411
<v Speaker 3>Now it doesn't work like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's probably how you got your neck </v>

1724
01:17:12.411 --> 01:17:12.411
<v Speaker 3>fucked up to that for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1725
01:17:12.411 --> 01:17:16.920
<v Speaker 3>but you have to look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why if you're going to work with </v>

1726
01:17:16.920 --> 01:17:16.920
<v Speaker 3>an athlete,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to be thinking,</v>

1727
01:17:16.920 --> 01:17:20.501
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we want you to go in belt and defend it </v>

1728
01:17:20.501 --> 01:17:20.501
<v Speaker 3>seven,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eight times.</v>

1729
01:17:20.501 --> 01:17:21.260
<v Speaker 3>You can make a bunch of money and not </v>
<v Speaker 3>have to work again.</v>

1730
01:17:21.500 --> 01:17:23.120
<v Speaker 3>He hasn't been thinking about that in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the beginning.</v>

1731
01:17:23.600 --> 01:17:26.150
<v Speaker 3>You can't wait until that happened and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then try to do it.</v>

1732
01:17:26.150 --> 01:17:29.480
<v Speaker 3>All of a sudden if you're a guy like we </v>
<v Speaker 3>had this guy fought in the UFC,</v>

1733
01:17:29.481 --> 01:17:30.910
<v Speaker 3>used to train with us and he'd always </v>
<v Speaker 3>come.</v>

1734
01:17:30.950 --> 01:17:34.190
<v Speaker 3>I did 10 rounds today and I always had </v>
<v Speaker 3>the same response,</v>

1735
01:17:34.430 --> 01:17:36.480
<v Speaker 3>how many runs you're fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he [inaudible],</v>

1736
01:17:36.960 --> 01:17:41.960
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna Kinda look at them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We never kind of never really got that </v>

1737
01:17:41.960 --> 01:17:45.470
<v Speaker 3>and as a result his body was done at </v>
<v Speaker 3>some other issues in his career is over,</v>

1738
01:17:45.770 --> 01:17:50.770
<v Speaker 3>so unless you look at the overall </v>
<v Speaker 3>overall arc of your career and how much </v>

1739
01:17:50.770 --> 01:17:52.790
<v Speaker 3>you're going to push your body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you only have so much.</v>

1740
01:17:53.840 --> 01:17:55.430
<v Speaker 3>You only have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can only do so much.</v>

1741
01:17:55.480 --> 01:17:57.440
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to tell young Fargo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't it,</v>

1742
01:17:57.880 --> 01:18:00.920
<v Speaker 3>that you only have so much in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>pullback?</v>

1743
01:18:01.070 --> 01:18:03.500
<v Speaker 3>Don't push as hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a way to tell it.</v>

1744
01:18:03.710 --> 01:18:04.850
<v Speaker 3>Here's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's a great example.</v>

1745
01:18:04.851 --> 01:18:08.070
<v Speaker 3>I have my first female who's just signed</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the ascent,</v>

1746
01:18:08.071 --> 01:18:13.071
<v Speaker 3>name's Kyle and current and she came at </v>
<v Speaker 3>terrain about a year ago and she was.</v>

1747
01:18:13.490 --> 01:18:14.600
<v Speaker 3>What happens?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people,</v>

1748
01:18:14.601 --> 01:18:15.470
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's in the class.</v>

1749
01:18:15.471 --> 01:18:16.880
<v Speaker 3>No one's working with her and she </v>
<v Speaker 3>approached.</v>

1750
01:18:16.960 --> 01:18:20.390
<v Speaker 3>I liked her from the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's something about I value my first</v>

1751
01:18:20.391 --> 01:18:22.730
<v Speaker 3>evaluation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mathlete is purely emotional.</v>

1752
01:18:22.731 --> 01:18:27.731
<v Speaker 3>I look at them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can usually tell if they're going to </v>

1753
01:18:27.731 --> 01:18:29.381
<v Speaker 3>be good this quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whole bunch of other things has to </v>

1754
01:18:29.381 --> 01:18:29.381
<v Speaker 3>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have to see work ethic.</v>

1755
01:18:29.381 --> 01:18:31.100
<v Speaker 3>We have to have a connection.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have to be passionate about them,</v>

1756
01:18:31.101 --> 01:18:33.260
<v Speaker 3>they have to connect with me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all these things have to happen,</v>

1757
01:18:33.620 --> 01:18:35.540
<v Speaker 3>but she had something special from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>beginning,</v>

1758
01:18:35.541 --> 01:18:39.410
<v Speaker 3>but I didn't spend a whole lot of time </v>
<v Speaker 3>with her and she asked me to manager and</v>

1759
01:18:40.130 --> 01:18:42.380
<v Speaker 3>even though there was no future for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>UFC,</v>

1760
01:18:42.381 --> 01:18:44.020
<v Speaker 3>didn't have a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

1761
01:18:44.050 --> 01:18:49.050
<v Speaker 3>a division in her weight class.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I found myself saying yes and kind of </v>

1762
01:18:49.050 --> 01:18:49.050
<v Speaker 3>started this development process with </v>
<v Speaker 3>her,</v>

1763
01:18:49.050 --> 01:18:53.860
<v Speaker 3>so we started really five months ago and</v>
<v Speaker 3>we threw away everything that she was </v>

1764
01:18:53.860 --> 01:18:53.860
<v Speaker 3>doing.</v>

1765
01:18:53.860 --> 01:18:55.490
<v Speaker 3>She had never really trained before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you look at it,</v>

1766
01:18:55.491 --> 01:19:00.491
<v Speaker 3>if you pull a picture up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's really put together a beautiful </v>

1767
01:19:00.491 --> 01:19:00.491
<v Speaker 3>girl.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's super strong,</v>

1768
01:19:00.491 --> 01:19:01.070
<v Speaker 3>great house,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but didn't,</v>

1769
01:19:01.130 --> 01:19:04.490
<v Speaker 3>didn't really know how to use all this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me start from the beginning.</v>

1770
01:19:04.491 --> 01:19:04.970
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>

1771
01:19:04.971 --> 01:19:06.170
<v Speaker 3>give,</v>
<v Speaker 3>give me four months.</v>

1772
01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:10.130
<v Speaker 3>Here's what we're gonna do come October.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wait to see how good you are and here we</v>

1773
01:19:10.131 --> 01:19:12.320
<v Speaker 3>are in now the October,</v>
<v Speaker 3>November.</v>

1774
01:19:12.321 --> 01:19:14.270
<v Speaker 3>She's incredible art now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She to debut in November,</v>

1775
01:19:14.271 --> 01:19:17.750
<v Speaker 3>20 seconds against Paige vanzant and we </v>
<v Speaker 3>took the same approach.</v>

1776
01:19:18.170 --> 01:19:20.570
<v Speaker 3>What works for you today?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's her background?</v>

1777
01:19:20.571 --> 01:19:23.740
<v Speaker 3>Initially she wrestled in high school </v>
<v Speaker 3>and she's got a striking background.</v>

1778
01:19:23.760 --> 01:19:27.440
<v Speaker 3>He's got a beautiful striking style.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty rare to have a chick russell</v>

1779
01:19:27.441 --> 01:19:28.430
<v Speaker 3>in high school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1780
01:19:28.490 --> 01:19:29.840
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well she's from Hawaii.</v>

1781
01:19:29.841 --> 01:19:31.160
<v Speaker 3>They all seem to like the fight over </v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

1782
01:19:31.161 --> 01:19:32.780
<v Speaker 3>but she's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's.</v>

1783
01:19:33.140 --> 01:19:38.140
<v Speaker 3>She could be a big star in the UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we took the same development </v>

1784
01:19:38.140 --> 01:19:38.510
<v Speaker 3>approach,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so what I need to find out was because I</v>

1785
01:19:38.511 --> 01:19:43.511
<v Speaker 3>got a sense that she really hadn't had.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She'd never had structured training </v>

1786
01:19:43.511 --> 01:19:46.901
<v Speaker 3>camps before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She just kind of go workout and then go </v>

1787
01:19:46.901 --> 01:19:47.540
<v Speaker 3>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I took on two different sessions over</v>

1788
01:19:47.541 --> 01:19:48.200
<v Speaker 3>the summer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

1789
01:19:48.201 --> 01:19:53.201
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well we're going to take the next three </v>

1790
01:19:53.201 --> 01:19:53.201
<v Speaker 3>weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna Really gonna push you.</v>

1791
01:19:53.201 --> 01:19:54.380
<v Speaker 3>And I found out where's her limit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>went to her body,</v>

1792
01:19:54.381 --> 01:19:59.381
<v Speaker 3>start pulling back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When did emotionally she start kind of </v>

1793
01:19:59.381 --> 01:19:59.381
<v Speaker 3>turning off a little bit and then we.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When we did that twice,</v>

1794
01:19:59.540 --> 01:20:04.540
<v Speaker 3>so when it came into this fight camp,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a real good sense of how much I </v>

1795
01:20:04.540 --> 01:20:08.010
<v Speaker 3>could push her and when we should pull </v>
<v Speaker 3>her back and makes all the difference.</v>

1796
01:20:08.011 --> 01:20:13.011
<v Speaker 3>When you're developing an athlete,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just hard to find someone who's </v>

1797
01:20:13.011 --> 01:20:13.740
<v Speaker 3>willing to put that kind of attention to</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone's career.</v>

1798
01:20:14.320 --> 01:20:16.380
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's very few people who do it.</v>

1799
01:20:16.381 --> 01:20:21.381
<v Speaker 3>That's why I said the talent pool and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Emma is not very big because we don't </v>

1800
01:20:21.381 --> 01:20:25.821
<v Speaker 3>have structured training environments </v>
<v Speaker 3>like a professional team that's got an </v>

1801
01:20:25.821 --> 01:20:27.720
<v Speaker 3>Ortho there at practice that has </v>
<v Speaker 3>physical therapists there.</v>

1802
01:20:27.750 --> 01:20:32.750
<v Speaker 3>They.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so it's my job to put that </v>

1803
01:20:32.750 --> 01:20:32.750
<v Speaker 3>together,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we'll do.</v>

1804
01:20:32.750 --> 01:20:32.860
<v Speaker 3>I have a sports psychologist I work </v>
<v Speaker 3>with.</v>

1805
01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:34.530
<v Speaker 3>If you can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to work with you.</v>

1806
01:20:34.531 --> 01:20:36.840
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to match you and we're going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to start looking at your training.</v>

1807
01:20:37.120 --> 01:20:39.430
<v Speaker 3>A manager should be involved with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>training manager,</v>

1808
01:20:39.450 --> 01:20:41.110
<v Speaker 3>should have relationships with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>coaches,</v>

1809
01:20:41.130 --> 01:20:44.580
<v Speaker 3>making sure that their athlete,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that that is your advocate.</v>

1810
01:20:45.550 --> 01:20:50.550
<v Speaker 3>I have relationships with doctors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If someone needs a to see an orthopedic </v>

1811
01:20:50.550 --> 01:20:54.231
<v Speaker 3>surgeon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we work with one of the best orthopedic </v>

1812
01:20:54.231 --> 01:20:54.231
<v Speaker 3>surgeons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a two month wait to get in.</v>

1813
01:20:54.231 --> 01:20:54.231
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they get in within two days.</v>

1814
01:20:54.690 --> 01:20:59.690
<v Speaker 3>If you need a sports psychologist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to make sure that happens </v>

1815
01:20:59.690 --> 01:20:59.690
<v Speaker 3>for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you have to see a dermatologist,</v>

1816
01:20:59.690 --> 01:21:03.501
<v Speaker 3>we're going to get you in immediately to</v>
<v Speaker 3>make sure that happens because the goal </v>

1817
01:21:03.501 --> 01:21:06.711
<v Speaker 3>is not what sponsor did you get me today</v>
<v Speaker 3>at this goal is I want you to go when I </v>

1818
01:21:07.111 --> 01:21:10.380
<v Speaker 3>want you to win a belt so nike calls us </v>
<v Speaker 3>not so.</v>

1819
01:21:10.381 --> 01:21:15.381
<v Speaker 3>Some little sponsor's going to give you </v>
<v Speaker 3>an extra 1500 bucks for this fight free </v>

1820
01:21:15.381 --> 01:21:15.510
<v Speaker 3>refrigerator.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1821
01:21:15.511 --> 01:21:16.260
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>great.</v>

1822
01:21:16.890 --> 01:21:21.890
<v Speaker 3>But unfortunately that's the mentality </v>
<v Speaker 3>that most fighters have that most camps </v>

1823
01:21:21.890 --> 01:21:24.120
<v Speaker 3>have and it's not that these trainers </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't care about their guys.</v>

1824
01:21:24.360 --> 01:21:25.860
<v Speaker 3>If you're running a gym,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

1825
01:21:26.520 --> 01:21:28.500
<v Speaker 3>the fighters not going to bring money </v>
<v Speaker 3>into your gym,</v>

1826
01:21:28.501 --> 01:21:33.501
<v Speaker 3>you have to divert your attention to </v>
<v Speaker 3>running classes and all the other </v>

1827
01:21:33.501 --> 01:21:34.660
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you have 40 fighters in there,</v>

1828
01:21:35.310 --> 01:21:38.040
<v Speaker 3>you can't give all them the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>attention that they deserve,</v>

1829
01:21:38.190 --> 01:21:43.190
<v Speaker 3>so you really have to pick favorites and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you really have to get behind your </v>

1830
01:21:43.190 --> 01:21:44.460
<v Speaker 3>athlete and give them every opportunity </v>
<v Speaker 3>that they can have to win.</v>

1831
01:21:44.780 --> 01:21:49.780
<v Speaker 2>Do you foresee perhaps developing a team</v>
<v Speaker 2>of people under you that do similar </v>

1832
01:21:50.331 --> 01:21:53.360
<v Speaker 2>things so you can broaden your approach </v>
<v Speaker 2>and pick more athletes?</v>

1833
01:21:53.361 --> 01:21:58.361
<v Speaker 2>Or do you think that the talent pool of </v>
<v Speaker 2>potential champions is so small that if </v>

1834
01:21:58.361 --> 01:22:02.591
<v Speaker 2>you did that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would almost be like a point of </v>

1835
01:22:02.591 --> 01:22:02.591
<v Speaker 2>diminishing returns?</v>

1836
01:22:02.591 --> 01:22:03.080
<v Speaker 3>I Dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's hard to say.</v>

1837
01:22:03.081 --> 01:22:08.081
<v Speaker 3>I have a great team around me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've prayed for striking coaches that I </v>

1838
01:22:08.081 --> 01:22:08.360
<v Speaker 3>work with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who Do you work with?</v>

1839
01:22:08.361 --> 01:22:11.670
<v Speaker 3>Struggling coaches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure men are is.</v>

1840
01:22:11.720 --> 01:22:13.820
<v Speaker 3>We've worked together for a jar 12 </v>
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

1841
01:22:13.821 --> 01:22:15.740
<v Speaker 3>Danny Perez has done our boxing for </v>
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

1842
01:22:15.741 --> 01:22:20.741
<v Speaker 3>He got the king most started recently </v>
<v Speaker 3>with Antony hardonk in La Shit and they </v>

1843
01:22:21.891 --> 01:22:24.410
<v Speaker 3>all have different approaches to things </v>
<v Speaker 3>and again,</v>

1844
01:22:24.411 --> 01:22:29.411
<v Speaker 3>part of my job as their manager is to </v>
<v Speaker 3>help them develop relationships with </v>

1845
01:22:29.411 --> 01:22:31.410
<v Speaker 3>other coaches because Emma made their </v>
<v Speaker 3>camp inboxing.</v>

1846
01:22:31.430 --> 01:22:32.600
<v Speaker 3>You can be the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1847
01:22:32.601 --> 01:22:37.601
<v Speaker 3>You can be the one guy in mma.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's too many things that have to </v>

1848
01:22:37.601 --> 01:22:40.451
<v Speaker 3>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So my job is to introduce people and </v>

1849
01:22:40.451 --> 01:22:40.451
<v Speaker 3>help them develop relationships so they </v>
<v Speaker 3>can.</v>

1850
01:22:40.451 --> 01:22:44.890
<v Speaker 3>I want you to have a relationship with </v>
<v Speaker 3>your striking coach and your strength </v>

1851
01:22:44.890 --> 01:22:44.890
<v Speaker 3>and conditioning coach and all this type</v>
<v Speaker 3>of thing.</v>

1852
01:22:45.110 --> 01:22:50.110
<v Speaker 3>This is how you really have a great team</v>
<v Speaker 3>of people that I work with with these </v>

1853
01:22:50.110 --> 01:22:55.061
<v Speaker 3>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then I kind of oversee things I've </v>

1854
01:22:55.061 --> 01:22:55.061
<v Speaker 3>never worked</v>

1855
01:22:55.061 --> 01:22:57.460
<v Speaker 2>start with her dog,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I want to because he's got some </v>

1856
01:22:57.460 --> 01:22:57.460
<v Speaker 2>really unique ideas about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1857
01:22:57.460 --> 01:22:57.970
<v Speaker 2>Emma.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

1858
01:22:58.420 --> 01:23:03.420
<v Speaker 2>great kickboxer and some of the best leg</v>
<v Speaker 2>kick technique ever seen in the UFC </v>

1859
01:23:03.420 --> 01:23:04.420
<v Speaker 2>fantastic leg kicks.</v>

1860
01:23:04.810 --> 01:23:07.140
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he teaches them very different.</v>

1861
01:23:07.150 --> 01:23:12.150
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his whole style of teaching is a very </v>

1862
01:23:12.150 --> 01:23:12.150
<v Speaker 1>different guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a very unique point of view.</v>

1863
01:23:12.150 --> 01:23:12.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I was saying.</v>

1864
01:23:12.150 --> 01:23:14.200
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't believe in head movement.</v>

1865
01:23:14.660 --> 01:23:17.120
<v Speaker 1>Hit Him and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Mark Della Grotta.</v>

1866
01:23:17.130 --> 01:23:22.130
<v Speaker 1>We're going on it when we're in Vegas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not aggressively just debating back and </v>

1867
01:23:22.130 --> 01:23:22.910
<v Speaker 1>forth because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1868
01:23:23.170 --> 01:23:25.560
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe in the head movement to </v>
<v Speaker 1>move.</v>

1869
01:23:25.780 --> 01:23:28.390
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has this weird philosophy about,</v>

1870
01:23:28.420 --> 01:23:33.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not taking your head off the center </v>

1871
01:23:33.420 --> 01:23:35.731
<v Speaker 1>line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't know what his approach is </v>

1872
01:23:35.731 --> 01:23:35.731
<v Speaker 1>based on balance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't ever want,</v>

1873
01:23:35.731 --> 01:23:37.200
<v Speaker 1>want you to be in a position where </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're out of balance.</v>

1874
01:23:37.860 --> 01:23:39.700
<v Speaker 1>Well then how do you explain the guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>like dominick Cruz,</v>

1875
01:23:39.940 --> 01:23:44.260
<v Speaker 1>who's all head movement and is a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>monster is always to do it right,</v>

1876
01:23:44.261 --> 01:23:46.120
<v Speaker 1>and that's why my.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My approach isn't,</v>

1877
01:23:46.150 --> 01:23:47.200
<v Speaker 1>does that Ryan's way?</v>

1878
01:23:47.200 --> 01:23:48.490
<v Speaker 1>This is the way that we're going to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1879
01:23:48.491 --> 01:23:50.260
<v Speaker 1>My way is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay Joe,</v>

1880
01:23:50.290 --> 01:23:51.910
<v Speaker 1>here's your body type,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's your background,</v>

1881
01:23:51.911 --> 01:23:53.260
<v Speaker 1>here's what you feel most comfortable </v>
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>

1882
01:23:53.261 --> 01:23:55.810
<v Speaker 1>Here's your natural style.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What can we do?</v>

1883
01:23:55.811 --> 01:23:57.820
<v Speaker 1>What feels best for you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can go this direction.</v>

1884
01:23:57.821 --> 01:23:58.480
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you like?</v>

1885
01:23:58.660 --> 01:24:00.430
<v Speaker 1>This feels better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's go in this direction.</v>

1886
01:24:00.431 --> 01:24:05.431
<v Speaker 1>So if you gotta go cubs wants news,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wild and energetic and very </v>

1887
01:24:05.431 --> 01:24:07.900
<v Speaker 1>unpredictable and creative in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would enforce that for sure.</v>

1888
01:24:07.960 --> 01:24:08.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1889
01:24:08.560 --> 01:24:11.110
<v Speaker 1>I started before he got hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started working with Goya.</v>

1890
01:24:11.111 --> 01:24:14.530
<v Speaker 1>We just had in the beginning and go </v>
<v Speaker 1>though Eric Pres.</v>

1891
01:24:14.740 --> 01:24:15.280
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

1892
01:24:15.281 --> 01:24:15.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1893
01:24:16.090 --> 01:24:18.730
<v Speaker 1>And the whole thing would go crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was crazy.</v>

1894
01:24:18.731 --> 01:24:19.440
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he even said,</v>

1895
01:24:19.450 --> 01:24:20.680
<v Speaker 1>coach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm crazy and I work.</v>

1896
01:24:20.710 --> 01:24:21.940
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not.</v>

1897
01:24:21.970 --> 01:24:23.740
<v Speaker 1>I think he had been told he's crazy so </v>
<v Speaker 1>much.</v>

1898
01:24:23.850 --> 01:24:24.880
<v Speaker 1>He started to believe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1899
01:24:24.881 --> 01:24:25.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm crazy.</v>

1900
01:24:25.360 --> 01:24:28.570
<v Speaker 1>And what were like wild and won't follow</v>
<v Speaker 1>a plan and all this different.</v>

1901
01:24:28.571 --> 01:24:32.020
<v Speaker 1>So I was kind of expecting that of him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was the complete opposite.</v>

1902
01:24:32.260 --> 01:24:37.260
<v Speaker 1>He was super coachable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>follow the plan and did all those </v>

1903
01:24:37.260 --> 01:24:37.260
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

1904
01:24:37.260 --> 01:24:38.650
<v Speaker 1>it's not only the technical side of </v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

1905
01:24:38.651 --> 01:24:41.470
<v Speaker 1>it's helping someone understand how they</v>
<v Speaker 1>fit in,</v>

1906
01:24:41.740 --> 01:24:44.120
<v Speaker 1>in helping them understand themselves a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit better too.</v>

1907
01:24:44.630 --> 01:24:46.990
<v Speaker 1>So if you've only heard that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy,</v>

1908
01:24:47.610 --> 01:24:49.630
<v Speaker 1>well that becomes a self fulfilling </v>
<v Speaker 1>prophecy.</v>

1909
01:24:49.631 --> 01:24:54.631
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden maybe you don't start </v>
<v Speaker 1>falling game plans and things like you </v>

1910
01:24:54.631 --> 01:24:56.470
<v Speaker 1>would've said no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's actually a super disciplined,</v>

1911
01:24:56.471 --> 01:25:01.471
<v Speaker 1>hardworking guy who needs a bit of </v>
<v Speaker 1>guidance and structure in this </v>

1912
01:25:01.471 --> 01:25:04.201
<v Speaker 1>particular way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How I'd work with is totally different </v>

1913
01:25:04.201 --> 01:25:04.310
<v Speaker 1>than Pat Goya's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>younger Kyland's,</v>

1914
01:25:04.320 --> 01:25:09.320
<v Speaker 1>a 23 year old female.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to work with her different than </v>

1915
01:25:09.320 --> 01:25:09.460
<v Speaker 1>pat who's a 33 year old guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had,</v>

1916
01:25:09.970 --> 01:25:11.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more experience.</v>

1917
01:25:11.230 --> 01:25:16.230
<v Speaker 1>And she has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does a big thing that happens with </v>

1918
01:25:16.230 --> 01:25:16.230
<v Speaker 1>fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1919
01:25:16.230 --> 01:25:19.630
<v Speaker 1>and it's the relationships that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>have outside of fighting,</v>

1920
01:25:19.631 --> 01:25:24.550
<v Speaker 1>sabotaging their fighting careers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a fucking huge thing cause fighters</v>

1921
01:25:25.580 --> 01:25:29.950
<v Speaker 1>is incredibly emotionally involved thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do with your life.</v>

1922
01:25:30.020 --> 01:25:32.860
<v Speaker 1>There's so much involved in winning and </v>
<v Speaker 1>losing.</v>

1923
01:25:32.861 --> 01:25:37.861
<v Speaker 1>The highs are so high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The lows are so low and they oftentimes </v>

1924
01:25:37.861 --> 01:25:41.521
<v Speaker 1>seek comfort in relationships like </v>
<v Speaker 1>girlfriends that you can't live without.</v>

1925
01:25:42.160 --> 01:25:47.160
<v Speaker 1>Boyfriends he can't live without and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think that for the female fighters it's </v>

1926
01:25:47.160 --> 01:25:50.890
<v Speaker 1>probably even more difficult because </v>
<v Speaker 1>unless they're fighting,</v>

1927
01:25:50.891 --> 01:25:55.891
<v Speaker 1>like as a female fighter develops and </v>
<v Speaker 1>grows and gets to like a place where </v>

1928
01:25:55.891 --> 01:25:59.401
<v Speaker 1>she's perhaps challenging for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>championship unless she's dating a </v>

1929
01:25:59.401 --> 01:26:03.571
<v Speaker 1>similar level fighter who can kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>relate the guy she's</v>

1930
01:26:04.190 --> 01:26:05.450
<v Speaker 1>dating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A Guy I've never heard of.</v>

1931
01:26:05.451 --> 01:26:06.940
<v Speaker 1>A fucking woman was a fighter dating </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys,</v>

1932
01:26:06.941 --> 01:26:08.750
<v Speaker 1>not a fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you heard of it?</v>

1933
01:26:09.110 --> 01:26:10.870
<v Speaker 1>I've never heard of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never thought about that.</v>

1934
01:26:11.420 --> 01:26:16.420
<v Speaker 1>CAITLIN's fortunate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Her boyfriend is a professional surfer </v>

1935
01:26:16.420 --> 01:26:18.110
<v Speaker 1>for now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean?</v>

1936
01:26:18.320 --> 01:26:20.660
<v Speaker 1>Once she starts kicking people's asses </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the UFC,</v>

1937
01:26:21.050 --> 01:26:26.050
<v Speaker 1>I'm fucking moving up the ladder and </v>
<v Speaker 1>this surfer dude sitting on the </v>

1938
01:26:26.050 --> 01:26:28.010
<v Speaker 1>sidelines going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess anything's possible,</v>

1939
01:26:28.011 --> 01:26:31.610
<v Speaker 1>but yet they're there to really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really solid good people.</v>

1940
01:26:31.700 --> 01:26:33.100
<v Speaker 1>That's her right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1941
01:26:33.860 --> 01:26:38.860
<v Speaker 1>she's beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's going to be a huge star in her </v>

1942
01:26:38.860 --> 01:26:38.860
<v Speaker 1>chest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1943
01:26:38.860 --> 01:26:40.730
<v Speaker 1>it's some type of religious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1944
01:26:41.180 --> 01:26:42.650
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

1945
01:26:42.910 --> 01:26:44.300
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

1946
01:26:44.330 --> 01:26:49.330
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the trouble that if you have someone </v>

1947
01:26:49.330 --> 01:26:49.330
<v Speaker 1>who's super talented almost all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

1948
01:26:49.330 --> 01:26:51.320
<v Speaker 1>it's not what happens in the kitchen or </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the gym.</v>

1949
01:26:51.321 --> 01:26:53.840
<v Speaker 1>It's their challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's everything that happens afterwards.</v>

1950
01:26:53.870 --> 01:26:58.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The friends that he grew up with are </v>

1951
01:26:58.870 --> 01:27:00.581
<v Speaker 1>still kind of fucking up and holding </v>
<v Speaker 1>them back and then it's the all the </v>

1952
01:27:00.581 --> 01:27:00.581
<v Speaker 1>hangar.</v>

1953
01:27:00.581 --> 01:27:00.990
<v Speaker 1>As soon as you get famous enough to see </v>
<v Speaker 1>all that,</v>

1954
01:27:01.050 --> 01:27:06.050
<v Speaker 1>you'll get phone calls from all sorts of</v>
<v Speaker 1>weird people who promise you weird </v>

1955
01:27:06.050 --> 01:27:06.050
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I had a fighter,</v>

1956
01:27:06.050 --> 01:27:07.220
<v Speaker 1>it got pretty famous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden he,</v>

1957
01:27:07.610 --> 01:27:09.640
<v Speaker 1>this manager is calling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have multiple,</v>

1958
01:27:10.070 --> 01:27:12.650
<v Speaker 1>multiple sponsors with fortune 500 </v>
<v Speaker 1>companies.</v>

1959
01:27:13.280 --> 01:27:14.570
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got,</v>

1960
01:27:14.571 --> 01:27:15.500
<v Speaker 1>of course it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1961
01:27:15.730 --> 01:27:16.920
<v Speaker 1>it's all bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you'll get,</v>

1962
01:27:16.950 --> 01:27:20.420
<v Speaker 1>as soon as someone gets famous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll have 50 people in your ear.</v>

1963
01:27:20.450 --> 01:27:22.700
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there isn't a single fortune 500 company</v>

1964
01:27:22.701 --> 01:27:24.410
<v Speaker 1>that sponsors fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

1965
01:27:24.870 --> 01:27:25.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1966
01:27:25.970 --> 01:27:28.520
<v Speaker 1>but been Nike's probably a fortune 500 </v>
<v Speaker 1>company,</v>

1967
01:27:28.521 --> 01:27:29.100
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1968
01:27:29.150 --> 01:27:30.770
<v Speaker 1>So it was probably 90.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's about it.</v>

1969
01:27:31.490 --> 01:27:34.960
<v Speaker 1>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fortune 500 company with multiple,</v>

1970
01:27:35.390 --> 01:27:37.780
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know how to have this </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation with you,</v>

1971
01:27:37.781 --> 01:27:38.630
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fortune 500,</v>

1972
01:27:38.631 --> 01:27:39.580
<v Speaker 1>I think it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1973
01:27:40.170 --> 01:27:44.630
<v Speaker 1>There's like fortune 500 and Nike's top </v>
<v Speaker 1>corporations in the world,</v>

1974
01:27:44.631 --> 01:27:45.590
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it means.</v>

1975
01:27:48.010 --> 01:27:49.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there you go.</v>

1976
01:27:49.600 --> 01:27:50.950
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what happened?</v>

1977
01:27:50.951 --> 01:27:53.690
<v Speaker 1>So someone will get famous and all of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sudden everyone,</v>

1978
01:27:53.780 --> 01:27:55.730
<v Speaker 1>you should be doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why aren't you doing this?</v>

1979
01:27:55.731 --> 01:27:58.760
<v Speaker 1>You shouldn't be doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And all of a sudden that chatter becomes</v>

1980
01:27:58.761 --> 01:28:00.770
<v Speaker 1>too much and people spin off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it happens.</v>

1981
01:28:01.160 --> 01:28:03.380
<v Speaker 1>It's more common than,</v>
<v Speaker 1>than not.</v>

1982
01:28:03.580 --> 01:28:05.420
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you start to get famous,</v>

1983
01:28:05.480 --> 01:28:07.250
<v Speaker 1>most likely you're going to do all the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>

1984
01:28:07.251 --> 01:28:09.210
<v Speaker 1>I liked the exam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the port mortem post mortem of,</v>

1985
01:28:09.211 --> 01:28:10.640
<v Speaker 1>of someone's career and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1986
01:28:10.641 --> 01:28:12.620
<v Speaker 1>here's everything you did right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's all the things you did wrong.</v>

1987
01:28:13.040 --> 01:28:15.800
<v Speaker 1>It's shocking how many people go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1988
01:28:15.801 --> 01:28:17.420
<v Speaker 1>we'll do the same thing over and over </v>
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

1989
01:28:17.780 --> 01:28:19.490
<v Speaker 1>Like I mentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you were selling a widget,</v>

1990
01:28:19.670 --> 01:28:24.670
<v Speaker 1>you're selling this and you sold 10 </v>
<v Speaker 1>million of them by these sales channels </v>

1991
01:28:24.670 --> 01:28:25.590
<v Speaker 1>with this marketing plan and this color.</v>

1992
01:28:25.590 --> 01:28:27.630
<v Speaker 1>And this was your biggest one and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>sold 10 million.</v>

1993
01:28:27.631 --> 01:28:30.290
<v Speaker 1>Then we went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to sell on a different shape,</v>

1994
01:28:30.300 --> 01:28:31.910
<v Speaker 1>a different color in a totally different</v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

1995
01:28:31.911 --> 01:28:33.590
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would in a business sense,</v>

1996
01:28:33.591 --> 01:28:38.591
<v Speaker 1>that would be ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this happens all the time with </v>

1997
01:28:38.591 --> 01:28:38.591
<v Speaker 1>fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>With fighters.</v>

1998
01:28:38.591 --> 01:28:39.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How does that work?</v>

1999
01:28:39.261 --> 01:28:42.010
<v Speaker 1>Like say what if you had a fight?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like let's,</v>

2000
01:28:42.011 --> 01:28:45.200
<v Speaker 1>let's look at Chris Weidman's first </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight with Anderson Silva.</v>

2001
01:28:45.230 --> 01:28:48.010
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm John Donahoe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's a brilliant guy.</v>

2002
01:28:48.050 --> 01:28:50.930
<v Speaker 1>Who's the trainer?</v>
<v Speaker 1>First thing Donna says,</v>

2003
01:28:50.931 --> 01:28:53.120
<v Speaker 1>when I go into the cage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said congratulations.</v>

2004
01:28:53.121 --> 01:28:58.121
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like how he's getting hit with </v>

2005
01:28:58.121 --> 01:28:58.121
<v Speaker 1>those leg kicks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those,</v>

2006
01:28:58.121 --> 01:28:58.940
<v Speaker 1>the first thing he said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we've really got to work on that.</v>

2007
01:28:59.320 --> 01:29:00.710
<v Speaker 1>That was the first thing out of his </v>
<v Speaker 1>mouth.</v>

2008
01:29:00.800 --> 01:29:04.120
<v Speaker 1>So what happens in the second fight?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Weidman checks the leg kicks and breaks.</v>

2009
01:29:04.121 --> 01:29:05.230
<v Speaker 1>Anderson's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2010
01:29:05.270 --> 01:29:08.160
<v Speaker 1>I mean literally checked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no leg kicks.</v>

2011
01:29:08.160 --> 01:29:10.950
<v Speaker 1>The first fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>broke Anderson's leg in the second fight</v>

2012
01:29:10.951 --> 01:29:15.951
<v Speaker 1>with leg kicks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's that kind of a trainer that </v>

2013
01:29:15.951 --> 01:29:18.411
<v Speaker 1>looks at you having the most insane </v>
<v Speaker 1>victory maybe ever in the middleweight </v>

2014
01:29:19.321 --> 01:29:24.321
<v Speaker 1>division.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're fighting the greatest of all </v>

2015
01:29:24.321 --> 01:29:24.321
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who?</v>

2016
01:29:24.321 --> 01:29:24.930
<v Speaker 1>Clowns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people hate clowns.</v>

2017
01:29:24.931 --> 01:29:29.931
<v Speaker 1>You and you fucking blast him into </v>
<v Speaker 1>another dimension with a left hook and </v>

2018
01:29:30.121 --> 01:29:35.121
<v Speaker 1>then basketball his head off the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I stepped into the cage moments later </v>

2019
01:29:35.121 --> 01:29:39.561
<v Speaker 1>and the first thing the trainer says is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like how he's getting hit with </v>

2020
01:29:39.561 --> 01:29:39.660
<v Speaker 1>all his leg kicks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's the kind of motherfucker you</v>

2021
01:29:39.661 --> 01:29:44.661
<v Speaker 1>want training you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want a guy who's not like the kids </v>

2022
01:29:44.661 --> 01:29:45.930
<v Speaker 1>the best ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the pest here though.</v>

2023
01:29:45.960 --> 01:29:48.980
<v Speaker 1>No one's got a peach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your kid show the best.</v>

2024
01:29:49.280 --> 01:29:51.960
<v Speaker 1>You know you don't want that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want the guy who's saying,</v>

2025
01:29:51.961 --> 01:29:56.961
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's look at what you did right and </v>

2026
01:29:56.961 --> 01:29:56.961
<v Speaker 1>let's look at what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was horribly wrong?</v>

2027
01:29:57.630 --> 01:30:00.210
<v Speaker 1>It depends on the athlete,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how you approach that.</v>

2028
01:30:00.510 --> 01:30:01.410
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2029
01:30:01.411 --> 01:30:03.570
<v Speaker 1>It's everyone's different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe with Chris Weidman,</v>

2030
01:30:03.571 --> 01:30:05.400
<v Speaker 1>I don't know him well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had lunch one time.</v>

2031
01:30:05.410 --> 01:30:07.620
<v Speaker 1>He's real nice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never worked with him,</v>

2032
01:30:07.980 --> 01:30:10.200
<v Speaker 1>but you have to talk to everybody </v>
<v Speaker 1>differently.</v>

2033
01:30:10.260 --> 01:30:11.670
<v Speaker 1>Everyone is not the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2034
01:30:11.671 --> 01:30:15.930
<v Speaker 1>you're a funny dude too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're not a schmoozer.</v>

2035
01:30:16.320 --> 01:30:17.160
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

2036
01:30:17.190 --> 01:30:21.750
<v Speaker 1>you're a real no bullshit kind of guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>and some people are not good with that.</v>

2037
01:30:22.020 --> 01:30:24.720
<v Speaker 1>Now a lot of people aren't and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2038
01:30:24.721 --> 01:30:29.721
<v Speaker 1>you've had relationships with fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Were they like it a certain point in </v>

2039
01:30:29.721 --> 01:30:29.721
<v Speaker 1>time?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2040
01:30:29.721 --> 01:30:29.721
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can't do this anymore.</v>

2041
01:30:29.790 --> 01:30:32.160
<v Speaker 1>And successful guys in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

2042
01:30:32.220 --> 01:30:33.720
<v Speaker 1>well we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we gave it a shot,</v>

2043
01:30:33.990 --> 01:30:38.990
<v Speaker 1>but it's just they didn't want to listen</v>
<v Speaker 1>to what you were saying and they would </v>

2044
01:30:38.990 --> 01:30:39.180
<v Speaker 1>like question like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who the fuck are you,</v>

2045
01:30:39.181 --> 01:30:41.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even how to fight and that kind of Shit,</v>

2046
01:30:41.911 --> 01:30:42.320
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2047
01:30:42.330 --> 01:30:46.710
<v Speaker 1>It happens after big wins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the odd part about it.</v>

2048
01:30:47.470 --> 01:30:50.790
<v Speaker 1>Like I had a guy who went to big fights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he came in the room and show technique.</v>

2049
01:30:50.791 --> 01:30:52.380
<v Speaker 1>He looked the other way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was done.</v>

2050
01:30:52.840 --> 01:30:55.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm not listening to you anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2051
01:30:56.010 --> 01:31:00.600
<v Speaker 1>Career didn't go well after that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this happens all the time.</v>

2052
01:31:00.601 --> 01:31:01.840
<v Speaker 1>But you have this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is that?</v>

2053
01:31:01.890 --> 01:31:03.240
<v Speaker 1>What do you think that is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2054
01:31:03.290 --> 01:31:08.290
<v Speaker 1>obviously it's ego,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what is that where a fighter does </v>

2055
01:31:08.290 --> 01:31:11.691
<v Speaker 1>not want to continue to grow and can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>step outside themselves and look and </v>

2056
01:31:12.571 --> 01:31:12.900
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2057
01:31:12.901 --> 01:31:17.901
<v Speaker 1>this is a position that I may be in and </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is some knowledge that I should </v>

2058
01:31:17.901 --> 01:31:21.411
<v Speaker 1>acquire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very difficult to look at what </v>

2059
01:31:21.411 --> 01:31:21.720
<v Speaker 1>you're doing and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this isn't right.</v>

2060
01:31:21.721 --> 01:31:25.020
<v Speaker 1>I need to make these changes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or sometimes it's even harder to go.</v>

2061
01:31:25.021 --> 01:31:27.000
<v Speaker 1>Boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it took me a lot of work to get here.</v>

2062
01:31:27.360 --> 01:31:29.340
<v Speaker 1>I think it's Kinda natural.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My daughter is seven.</v>

2063
01:31:29.700 --> 01:31:31.530
<v Speaker 1>She's in second grade and she said </v>
<v Speaker 1>gymnast.</v>

2064
01:31:31.820 --> 01:31:34.890
<v Speaker 1>So let this year she just started </v>
<v Speaker 1>winning everything,</v>

2065
01:31:35.190 --> 01:31:37.920
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She won every event in the all around in</v>

2066
01:31:37.921 --> 01:31:42.921
<v Speaker 1>two or three different meats and she got</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little cocky and stuff to work that </v>

2067
01:31:42.921 --> 01:31:44.050
<v Speaker 1>hard in the gym.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even her coach told me,</v>

2068
01:31:44.051 --> 01:31:45.060
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got this,</v>

2069
01:31:45.890 --> 01:31:49.080
<v Speaker 1>and then she lost and was pissed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2070
01:31:49.110 --> 01:31:51.270
<v Speaker 1>good old fashioned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My wife tried to bring her back.</v>

2071
01:31:51.271 --> 01:31:51.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2072
01:31:51.601 --> 01:31:53.310
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let her be angry like this.</v>

2073
01:31:53.311 --> 01:31:54.070
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was,</v>

2074
01:31:54.080 --> 01:31:58.290
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't like a cry baby pissed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like I'm pissed.</v>

2075
01:31:58.510 --> 01:31:59.560
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

2076
01:32:00.280 --> 01:32:02.830
<v Speaker 3>I think sometimes when success comes to </v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

2077
01:32:03.070 --> 01:32:08.070
<v Speaker 3>you start to believe that you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>invincible and you see this in business </v>

2078
01:32:08.070 --> 01:32:08.070
<v Speaker 3>all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2079
01:32:08.070 --> 01:32:10.280
<v Speaker 3>people are successful in business and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll start a new business in and fail</v>

2080
01:32:10.281 --> 01:32:12.660
<v Speaker 3>miserably happened to me when I first </v>
<v Speaker 3>got started in business,</v>

2081
01:32:12.670 --> 01:32:15.400
<v Speaker 3>a successful chiropractic offices in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Australia.</v>

2082
01:32:15.460 --> 01:32:16.750
<v Speaker 3>That happened right away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was young,</v>

2083
01:32:16.751 --> 01:32:21.751
<v Speaker 3>26 years old and all of a sudden I tried</v>
<v Speaker 3>something new and lost everything I </v>

2084
01:32:21.751 --> 01:32:23.080
<v Speaker 3>couldn't lose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I knew this,</v>

2085
01:32:23.081 --> 01:32:24.060
<v Speaker 3>I got this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I made a,</v>

2086
01:32:24.160 --> 01:32:25.270
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had done all these things.</v>

2087
01:32:25.271 --> 01:32:27.350
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and something happens in the brain.</v>

2088
01:32:27.351 --> 01:32:32.351
<v Speaker 3>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very difficult to keep resetting </v>

2089
01:32:32.351 --> 01:32:32.351
<v Speaker 3>yourself going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2090
01:32:32.351 --> 01:32:33.670
<v Speaker 3>today's a new day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's what worked from our last one,</v>

2091
01:32:33.880 --> 01:32:35.950
<v Speaker 3>here's what we're going to do next.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because often what happens to,</v>

2092
01:32:35.951 --> 01:32:40.951
<v Speaker 3>if someone has a big loss,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they want to change everything about </v>

2093
01:32:40.951 --> 01:32:40.951
<v Speaker 3>what they were doing.</v>

2094
01:32:40.951 --> 01:32:41.500
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need to do to train part.</v>

2095
01:32:41.501 --> 01:32:42.010
<v Speaker 3>I knew,</v>
<v Speaker 3>coach,</v>

2096
01:32:42.011 --> 01:32:44.020
<v Speaker 3>you have to do this as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's think about it.</v>

2097
01:32:44.021 --> 01:32:45.970
<v Speaker 3>You had all this success up until this </v>
<v Speaker 3>point.</v>

2098
01:32:46.810 --> 01:32:51.810
<v Speaker 3>Do we need to change everything or do we</v>
<v Speaker 3>need to make a small adjustment in this </v>

2099
01:32:51.810 --> 01:32:52.120
<v Speaker 3>one area?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And often that's what it is,</v>

2100
01:32:52.121 --> 01:32:53.890
<v Speaker 3>but people forever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the reason they can't,</v>

2101
01:32:54.400 --> 01:32:57.010
<v Speaker 3>they can't make the adjustment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pat's been really good with that.</v>

2102
01:32:57.011 --> 01:32:58.630
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had a big loss for Daniel.</v>

2103
01:32:58.631 --> 01:33:03.631
<v Speaker 3>That was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are hard for people to come back </v>

2104
01:33:03.631 --> 01:33:04.580
<v Speaker 3>within that sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>know people don't realize everything you</v>

2105
01:33:04.600 --> 01:33:06.100
<v Speaker 3>train.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not many people are going to do it.</v>

2106
01:33:06.101 --> 01:33:11.101
<v Speaker 3>Pat Did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which suffer for three and a half or </v>

2107
01:33:11.101 --> 01:33:11.101
<v Speaker 3>four years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>train every day,</v>

2108
01:33:11.101 --> 01:33:12.670
<v Speaker 3>go through this whole process,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not make any money.</v>

2109
01:33:12.910 --> 01:33:14.170
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every year,</v>

2110
01:33:14.180 --> 01:33:15.310
<v Speaker 3>birthday,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one year old,</v>

2111
01:33:15.311 --> 01:33:17.440
<v Speaker 3>he finally gets a shot and then he loses</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>

2112
01:33:17.740 --> 01:33:19.900
<v Speaker 3>It's very hard to come back and to his </v>
<v Speaker 3>credit,</v>

2113
01:33:19.901 --> 01:33:22.420
<v Speaker 3>he did that and we looked at everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We said,</v>

2114
01:33:22.421 --> 01:33:24.010
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's a couple of areas that we need to</v>

2115
01:33:24.011 --> 01:33:29.011
<v Speaker 3>change.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't throwaway the playbook and we </v>

2116
01:33:29.011 --> 01:33:29.011
<v Speaker 3>start over again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>

2117
01:33:29.011 --> 01:33:30.520
<v Speaker 3>here's what we need to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we do that for every camp.</v>

2118
01:33:31.030 --> 01:33:33.520
<v Speaker 3>Some people are willing to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most people are not.</v>

2119
01:33:34.030 --> 01:33:34.930
<v Speaker 3>Which is why,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

2120
01:33:34.931 --> 01:33:37.930
<v Speaker 3>we talk about is there going to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>enough talent development in this area?</v>

2121
01:33:38.560 --> 01:33:43.560
<v Speaker 3>It's very hard to get someone prepared </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be successful in the long time in a </v>

2122
01:33:43.560 --> 01:33:44.110
<v Speaker 3>cage because most guys would get signed </v>
<v Speaker 3>to the UFC,</v>

2123
01:33:44.111 --> 01:33:45.820
<v Speaker 3>are there for a couple of fights and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's it.</v>

2124
01:33:46.730 --> 01:33:51.680
<v Speaker 2>How did you decide to dedicate your time</v>
<v Speaker 2>and your life to this?</v>

2125
01:33:51.681 --> 01:33:56.681
<v Speaker 2>Because this is a very tricky position </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be in because you're not the master </v>

2126
01:33:56.681 --> 01:34:01.451
<v Speaker 2>of your own destiny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You are the master of creating the </v>

2127
01:34:01.451 --> 01:34:05.441
<v Speaker 2>opportunities for someone else to </v>
<v Speaker 2>achieve their destiny and your destiny </v>

2128
01:34:05.441 --> 01:34:09.091
<v Speaker 2>is essentially tied in to them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tied into their work ethic,</v>

2129
01:34:09.171 --> 01:34:11.180
<v Speaker 2>their willpower.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're focused.</v>

2130
01:34:11.181 --> 01:34:12.880
<v Speaker 2>They're all of the above,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>

2131
01:34:12.881 --> 01:34:17.881
<v Speaker 2>their athleticism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their natural talents as well as their </v>

2132
01:34:17.881 --> 01:34:22.240
<v Speaker 2>intuition and those intangible factors </v>
<v Speaker 2>like the toughness that Dan has or you </v>

2133
01:34:22.761 --> 01:34:23.290
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2134
01:34:23.291 --> 01:34:28.291
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the freak athleticism that some other </v>

2135
01:34:28.291 --> 01:34:28.550
<v Speaker 2>fighters have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's so many factors and your life.</v>

2136
01:34:28.551 --> 01:34:33.551
<v Speaker 2>You're very fucking smart guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but your life is tied in with their </v>

2137
01:34:33.551 --> 01:34:36.650
<v Speaker 2>success and I'll sound that smart now </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing what you do because it's working,</v>

2138
01:34:36.920 --> 01:34:38.810
<v Speaker 2>but how did you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2139
01:34:38.811 --> 01:34:40.880
<v Speaker 2>you had a million times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2140
01:34:40.910 --> 01:34:41.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

2141
01:34:41.430 --> 01:34:42.990
<v Speaker 2>There's always tough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's</v>

2142
01:34:43.320 --> 01:34:45.090
<v Speaker 3>personality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I finished chiropractic school,</v>

2143
01:34:45.091 --> 01:34:50.091
<v Speaker 3>I got a great offer and Phoenix from an </v>
<v Speaker 3>amazing doctor who was a mentor to me </v>

2144
01:34:50.091 --> 01:34:54.850
<v Speaker 3>and instead I with no money in my pocket</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a one way ticket to Australia ship </v>

2145
01:34:55.051 --> 01:34:57.180
<v Speaker 3>my hundred and 50 pound Neapolitan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>massive.</v>

2146
01:34:57.320 --> 01:35:00.710
<v Speaker 3>Not enough minding Americorps and teen </v>
<v Speaker 3>30 days later and went and made it work,</v>

2147
01:35:01.520 --> 01:35:06.520
<v Speaker 3>so I guess it's my personality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I knew I wanted to move to another </v>

2148
01:35:07.161 --> 01:35:12.161
<v Speaker 3>country who's either Costa Rica or </v>
<v Speaker 3>Australia and I chose this tray because </v>

2149
01:35:12.161 --> 01:35:16.121
<v Speaker 3>there was an established chiropractic </v>
<v Speaker 3>association there and I had met an </v>

2150
01:35:16.121 --> 01:35:18.200
<v Speaker 3>Aussie girl which made them move a </v>
<v Speaker 3>little bit easier and literally bought a</v>

2151
01:35:18.201 --> 01:35:20.660
<v Speaker 3>one way ticket,</v>
<v Speaker 3>landed there with no money,</v>

2152
01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:26.000
<v Speaker 3>but it taught me a valuable lesson </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I had made this decision 18 </v>

2153
01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:27.020
<v Speaker 3>months prior for 18 months.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every day.</v>

2154
01:35:27.021 --> 01:35:32.021
<v Speaker 3>I said the same mantra to myself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that the intention is so </v>

2155
01:35:32.021 --> 01:35:34.160
<v Speaker 3>important in your life on what you </v>
<v Speaker 3>decided to focus on.</v>

2156
01:35:34.160 --> 01:35:36.470
<v Speaker 3>I mean really focused on with all of </v>
<v Speaker 3>your energy.</v>

2157
01:35:36.860 --> 01:35:41.860
<v Speaker 3>I believe that if you're in that place </v>
<v Speaker 3>with full trust that the universe will </v>

2158
01:35:41.860 --> 01:35:43.120
<v Speaker 3>direct you in this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in this direction.</v>

2159
01:35:43.270 --> 01:35:44.080
<v Speaker 3>Woo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Crazy.</v>

2160
01:35:44.150 --> 01:35:45.350
<v Speaker 3>Sounds really crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2161
01:35:45.590 --> 01:35:48.500
<v Speaker 3>So every day I said to myself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for 18 months,</v>

2162
01:35:48.680 --> 01:35:50.870
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to move to Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My live in the tropics.</v>

2163
01:35:50.871 --> 01:35:51.910
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have my own practice.</v>

2164
01:35:51.920 --> 01:35:56.920
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to move to Australia and I </v>

2165
01:35:56.920 --> 01:35:59.111
<v Speaker 3>live in the tropics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said this mantra over 20 times in </v>

2166
01:35:59.111 --> 01:36:00.260
<v Speaker 3>Australia because of the check.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I just.</v>

2167
01:36:00.261 --> 01:36:02.330
<v Speaker 3>I looked at Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was great.</v>

2168
01:36:02.430 --> 01:36:07.430
<v Speaker 3>It looked like a nice place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to move to another country and </v>

2169
01:36:07.430 --> 01:36:09.731
<v Speaker 3>here I go and I wanted to live in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>tropics that had been to the Caribbean </v>

2170
01:36:09.731 --> 01:36:12.371
<v Speaker 3>at 14 and night,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sitting on Saint Croix on January 2nd </v>

2171
01:36:12.371 --> 01:36:16.751
<v Speaker 3>and it's 88 degrees and I'm 14 and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>couldn't understand where there were </v>

2172
01:36:16.751 --> 01:36:18.480
<v Speaker 3>places like this and I lived where I did</v>
<v Speaker 3>the two just didn't,</v>

2173
01:36:18.970 --> 01:36:19.940
<v Speaker 3>didn't add up to me.</v>

2174
01:36:19.940 --> 01:36:21.590
<v Speaker 3>So I decided I wanted to live in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>tropics.</v>

2175
01:36:21.591 --> 01:36:24.560
<v Speaker 3>Australia seemed like a good place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I landed there,</v>

2176
01:36:24.680 --> 01:36:27.920
<v Speaker 3>hated it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The relationship was done with the girl,</v>

2177
01:36:28.010 --> 01:36:30.770
<v Speaker 3>I don't have enough money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My dog is ticking down.</v>

2178
01:36:30.771 --> 01:36:33.410
<v Speaker 3>I got to come up with $1,500</v>
<v Speaker 3>to get them out of quarantine.</v>

2179
01:36:33.800 --> 01:36:34.820
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have no.</v>

2180
01:36:34.821 --> 01:36:39.821
<v Speaker 3>I've never had a job before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My only other skill was throwing people </v>

2181
01:36:39.821 --> 01:36:41.000
<v Speaker 3>out of a bar and now I had to go start a</v>
<v Speaker 3>business,</v>

2182
01:36:41.001 --> 01:36:42.680
<v Speaker 3>be it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>find some way to make this work.</v>

2183
01:36:43.490 --> 01:36:48.490
<v Speaker 3>Three and a half weeks later or three </v>
<v Speaker 3>days before my dogs do together </v>

2184
01:36:48.490 --> 01:36:52.010
<v Speaker 3>quarantine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I owned three practices in the Sunday </v>

2185
01:36:52.010 --> 01:36:52.370
<v Speaker 3>islands.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you.</v>

2186
01:36:52.400 --> 01:36:56.810
<v Speaker 3>They look up the Sunday that I believe </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the power of intention,</v>

2187
01:36:56.811 --> 01:36:58.760
<v Speaker 3>but I heard something from somebody got </v>
<v Speaker 3>in a car,</v>

2188
01:36:58.761 --> 01:37:03.761
<v Speaker 3>drove up 14 hours,</v>
<v Speaker 3>met a doctor who wanted to get out of </v>

2189
01:37:03.761 --> 01:37:03.761
<v Speaker 3>there quick.</v>

2190
01:37:03.761 --> 01:37:06.140
<v Speaker 3>She sold me her practices for $5,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>that she agreed to let me pay $1,000</v>

2191
01:37:06.141 --> 01:37:11.141
<v Speaker 3>a month over five months.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I walked in there my first day and made </v>

2192
01:37:11.141 --> 01:37:11.420
<v Speaker 3>like $800.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My first day,</v>

2193
01:37:11.690 --> 01:37:13.940
<v Speaker 3>I'm 26 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Went and got my dog,</v>

2194
01:37:13.941 --> 01:37:16.820
<v Speaker 3>had a quarantine and that was the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was my start.</v>

2195
01:37:17.040 --> 01:37:22.040
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I was willing to find out about her </v>

2196
01:37:22.040 --> 01:37:23.630
<v Speaker 3>how this is pre google.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2197
01:37:23.631 --> 01:37:24.470
<v Speaker 3>that's the PR.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's.</v>

2198
01:37:24.471 --> 01:37:29.471
<v Speaker 3>Here's the other thing too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I would do is I would get </v>

2199
01:37:29.471 --> 01:37:30.050
<v Speaker 3>chiropractic journals at the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2200
01:37:30.530 --> 01:37:35.530
<v Speaker 3>at the library.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was called Los Angeles College of </v>

2201
01:37:35.530 --> 01:37:38.840
<v Speaker 3>Chiropractic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I would cold call chiropractors and </v>

2202
01:37:38.840 --> 01:37:38.840
<v Speaker 3>just say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's it like down there?</v>

2203
01:37:38.840 --> 01:37:39.020
<v Speaker 3>Do you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would just call people.</v>

2204
01:37:39.080 --> 01:37:41.270
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's how I ended up.</v>

2205
01:37:41.271 --> 01:37:46.271
<v Speaker 3>So I was there for five years and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>would fly over to Japan to meet Dan and </v>

2206
01:37:46.271 --> 01:37:48.630
<v Speaker 3>then came back and decided that I wanted</v>
<v Speaker 3>to make.</v>

2207
01:37:48.710 --> 01:37:53.710
<v Speaker 3>Now the [inaudible] m I made the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There wasn't really a way to make a </v>

2208
01:37:53.710 --> 01:37:54.470
<v Speaker 3>living doing this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not much.</v>

2209
01:37:54.560 --> 01:37:55.410
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was,</v>

2210
01:37:55.460 --> 01:37:56.160
<v Speaker 3>it's what I wanted</v>

2211
01:37:56.160 --> 01:37:58.020
<v Speaker 1>to do and I had some other great things </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen,</v>

2212
01:37:58.021 --> 01:38:01.200
<v Speaker 1>but I think you asked me why I'm willing</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do it.</v>

2213
01:38:01.201 --> 01:38:03.810
<v Speaker 1>I think if I really trust my gut,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my intuition that,</v>

2214
01:38:03.910 --> 01:38:08.910
<v Speaker 1>that I'm going to be okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And through the process I met Kevin </v>

2215
01:38:08.910 --> 01:38:12.410
<v Speaker 1>James and worked with him for a year and</v>
<v Speaker 1>got involved with some movie stuff and </v>

2216
01:38:12.410 --> 01:38:13.710
<v Speaker 1>created a television show that we sold </v>
<v Speaker 1>to Fox that ultimately didn't get picked</v>

2217
01:38:13.711 --> 01:38:14.280
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But again,</v>

2218
01:38:14.281 --> 01:38:15.700
<v Speaker 1>all these other things started to </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>

2219
01:38:17.970 --> 01:38:22.830
<v Speaker 1>That was the weirdest shit over my </v>
<v Speaker 1>computer.</v>

2220
01:38:22.831 --> 01:38:27.210
<v Speaker 1>Just decided to start playing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just heard your voice mark computer.</v>

2221
01:38:27.390 --> 01:38:28.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's bizarre.</v>

2222
01:38:28.860 --> 01:38:33.860
<v Speaker 1>It's never done that before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have it on the page.</v>

2223
01:38:34.081 --> 01:38:39.081
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the fuck happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't even touching my computer </v>

2224
01:38:39.081 --> 01:38:39.081
<v Speaker 1>anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Important.</v>

2225
01:38:39.081 --> 01:38:40.030
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so for me,</v>

2226
01:38:40.080 --> 01:38:45.080
<v Speaker 1>for me it's about really trusting that </v>
<v Speaker 1>instinct that this is going to be the </v>

2227
01:38:45.080 --> 01:38:48.261
<v Speaker 1>right thing to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if there's not any evidence that </v>

2228
01:38:48.261 --> 01:38:48.261
<v Speaker 1>this is going to work out.</v>

2229
01:38:48.261 --> 01:38:51.450
<v Speaker 1>But you were involved with team quest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like even pre this,</v>

2230
01:38:51.840 --> 01:38:52.330
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2231
01:38:52.470 --> 01:38:55.560
<v Speaker 1>I created the name team quest and this </v>
<v Speaker 1>was back when?</v>

2232
01:38:55.561 --> 01:39:00.561
<v Speaker 1>Randy for Tony Palma in like 96.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think Randy started in [inaudible] 97.</v>

2233
01:39:02.580 --> 01:39:07.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He fought and I didn't have anything to </v>

2234
01:39:07.580 --> 01:39:07.580
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How am I?</v>

2235
01:39:07.580 --> 01:39:07.620
<v Speaker 1>Was his first fight in the UFC obviously</v>
<v Speaker 1>choked him.</v>

2236
01:39:07.920 --> 01:39:10.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was 2097.</v>

2237
01:39:11.280 --> 01:39:14.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I had known Dan and those guys from</v>

2238
01:39:14.041 --> 01:39:17.360
<v Speaker 1>college and kind of came up with them </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the full fighting started.</v>

2239
01:39:17.670 --> 01:39:22.670
<v Speaker 1>Everything kind of came from there and </v>
<v Speaker 1>every step of the way I looked at what </v>

2240
01:39:22.670 --> 01:39:23.460
<v Speaker 1>skills that I would need to develop to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be successful.</v>

2241
01:39:23.461 --> 01:39:28.461
<v Speaker 1>So initially it was all soft tissue </v>
<v Speaker 1>chiropractic stuff and then more and </v>

2242
01:39:28.461 --> 01:39:33.021
<v Speaker 1>more into nutrition and then I realized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh I really liked the training side of </v>

2243
01:39:33.021 --> 01:39:36.561
<v Speaker 1>things and I was only.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've only been involved with very high </v>

2244
01:39:36.561 --> 01:39:36.810
<v Speaker 1>level of camps but very high level </v>
<v Speaker 1>athlete.</v>

2245
01:39:36.810 --> 01:39:39.060
<v Speaker 1>That's been my whole experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lucky shit man.</v>

2246
01:39:39.080 --> 01:39:42.630
<v Speaker 1>97 may [inaudible] 1997.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2247
01:39:43.560 --> 01:39:48.030
<v Speaker 1>So I was there for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was there for that.</v>

2248
01:39:48.031 --> 01:39:53.031
<v Speaker 1>And Steve Grandfather afterwards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Steve Graham was a guy who a lot of </v>

2249
01:39:53.031 --> 01:39:56.091
<v Speaker 1>people had a lot a lot of hope for </v>
<v Speaker 1>people thought that was going to be </v>

2250
01:39:56.091 --> 01:39:56.091
<v Speaker 1>something special.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2251
01:39:56.091 --> 01:39:56.490
<v Speaker 1>Big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>strong,</v>

2252
01:39:56.491 --> 01:40:01.491
<v Speaker 1>fast athletic shoe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Randy just fucking pick them up and </v>

2253
01:40:01.491 --> 01:40:03.210
<v Speaker 1>smashed him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dumped him on his back and just beat the</v>

2254
01:40:03.211 --> 01:40:08.211
<v Speaker 1>fuck out of them and then beat the shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of Vituro and his third man fight </v>

2255
01:40:08.211 --> 01:40:12.620
<v Speaker 1>the time where everybody thought that </v>
<v Speaker 1>tour was the second coming of Jesus on </v>

2256
01:40:12.620 --> 01:40:16.611
<v Speaker 1>the screen and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it no known weaknesses and what </v>

2257
01:40:16.611 --> 01:40:16.611
<v Speaker 1>they put on this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2258
01:40:17.010 --> 01:40:22.010
<v Speaker 1>That was insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a 19 year old or 20 year old </v>

2259
01:40:22.010 --> 01:40:22.010
<v Speaker 1>veto or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was.</v>

2260
01:40:22.010 --> 01:40:22.540
<v Speaker 1>Probably 19.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2261
01:40:22.890 --> 01:40:27.890
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had gotten up to like 240 pounds by </v>

2262
01:40:27.890 --> 01:40:28.440
<v Speaker 1>then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You looked like a lion.</v>

2263
01:40:28.530 --> 01:40:32.310
<v Speaker 1>He didn't come out of his trailer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was in the cage waiting.</v>

2264
01:40:33.540 --> 01:40:34.910
<v Speaker 1>Also.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember that there was.</v>

2265
01:40:35.490 --> 01:40:39.330
<v Speaker 1>That was the infamous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had a worm excuse,</v>

2266
01:40:39.810 --> 01:40:40.740
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do I never heard?</v>

2267
01:40:40.750 --> 01:40:43.170
<v Speaker 1>This designer's randy just had kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>hanging out in the case.</v>

2268
01:40:43.530 --> 01:40:47.110
<v Speaker 1>There was some sort of parasitic issue </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he was thinking.</v>

2269
01:40:47.400 --> 01:40:50.430
<v Speaker 1>He was also training with this guy who </v>
<v Speaker 1>wind up dead.</v>

2270
01:40:50.870 --> 01:40:53.950
<v Speaker 1>This guy named Curtis who was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bodybuilder that,</v>

2271
01:40:53.951 --> 01:40:54.220
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2272
01:40:54.220 --> 01:40:54.970
<v Speaker 2>we would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2273
01:40:54.971 --> 01:40:59.971
<v Speaker 2>Eddie Bravo who's a eddie was my friend </v>
<v Speaker 2>even way back then from when we're at </v>

2274
01:40:59.971 --> 01:41:02.020
<v Speaker 2>John jocks and it was like a blue belt </v>
<v Speaker 2>or a purple belt.</v>

2275
01:41:02.030 --> 01:41:04.630
<v Speaker 2>I think he might have been even a blue </v>
<v Speaker 2>belt back then,</v>

2276
01:41:04.990 --> 01:41:05.560
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2277
01:41:06.250 --> 01:41:09.640
<v Speaker 2>we wound up working out the gym with </v>
<v Speaker 2>this dude at the same time,</v>

2278
01:41:09.670 --> 01:41:10.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we weren't working out with him,</v>

2279
01:41:10.841 --> 01:41:13.210
<v Speaker 2>but vittores trainer was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2280
01:41:13.470 --> 01:41:18.470
<v Speaker 2>just about as purple as a guy who get </v>
<v Speaker 2>and still be a white guy.</v>

2281
01:41:18.700 --> 01:41:20.470
<v Speaker 2>It was the weirdest shit ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2282
01:41:20.471 --> 01:41:25.471
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the fuck he was on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I assume it was everything all </v>

2283
01:41:25.471 --> 01:41:30.021
<v Speaker 2>together at once.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we used to call them garden hoses </v>

2284
01:41:30.021 --> 01:41:30.610
<v Speaker 2>because he had veins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like fucking garden hoses on his body.</v>

2285
01:41:30.611 --> 01:41:35.611
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were just the most retarded veins </v>

2286
01:41:35.611 --> 01:41:35.611
<v Speaker 2>you've ever seen in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was enormous.</v>

2287
01:41:35.611 --> 01:41:38.200
<v Speaker 2>He was maybe five,</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 and probably weighed 350 pounds.</v>

2288
01:41:39.250 --> 01:41:39.340
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2289
01:41:41.390 --> 01:41:42.750
<v Speaker 2>Just purple.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He would work out.</v>

2290
01:41:42.751 --> 01:41:45.570
<v Speaker 2>He was to a strength trainer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was his buddy,</v>

2291
01:41:46.170 --> 01:41:47.880
<v Speaker 2>trainer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bodybuilder,</v>

2292
01:41:48.180 --> 01:41:50.970
<v Speaker 2>supplier of Mexicans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>steroids or whatever the fuck it was,</v>

2293
01:41:50.971 --> 01:41:55.971
<v Speaker 2>whatever was going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But vituro had gotten up to two 40 and </v>

2294
01:41:55.971 --> 01:41:56.580
<v Speaker 2>this is over the course of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2295
01:41:56.581 --> 01:41:59.130
<v Speaker 2>fucking year gained about 40 pounds of </v>
<v Speaker 2>muscle.</v>

2296
01:41:59.370 --> 01:42:02.850
<v Speaker 2>And it was when everybody was worried </v>
<v Speaker 2>about Mark Coleman.</v>

2297
01:42:03.180 --> 01:42:08.180
<v Speaker 2>Everybody was worried about the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>hammer because they'd seen coleman in </v>

2298
01:42:08.180 --> 01:42:12.711
<v Speaker 2>his prime stud wrestler who had hit that</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking power double on you,</v>

2299
01:42:13.650 --> 01:42:17.460
<v Speaker 2>compress you into the cage and just beat</v>
<v Speaker 2>the piss out of people.</v>

2300
01:42:17.610 --> 01:42:20.970
<v Speaker 2>And everybody was thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do I keep this fucking guy off me?</v>

2301
01:42:21.300 --> 01:42:25.020
<v Speaker 2>And their solution was get as big as </v>
<v Speaker 2>colman and Colman was,</v>

2302
01:42:25.021 --> 01:42:29.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two 55 just just jacked the tests,</v>

2303
01:42:29.870 --> 01:42:32.700
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when he fought maurice,</v>

2304
01:42:32.701 --> 01:42:34.530
<v Speaker 2>nobody gave him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gave him a shot.</v>

2305
01:42:34.890 --> 01:42:36.240
<v Speaker 2>Everybody was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2306
01:42:36.270 --> 01:42:38.550
<v Speaker 2>Maurice got no shot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's going to get smashed.</v>

2307
01:42:38.850 --> 01:42:43.850
<v Speaker 2>And I remember talking to Maurice before</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fight and before the fight I was </v>

2308
01:42:43.850 --> 01:42:45.900
<v Speaker 2>supposed to do this thing for a NBC </v>
<v Speaker 2>where I was,</v>

2309
01:42:46.300 --> 01:42:48.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bob Costas used to have that show later.</v>

2310
01:42:48.840 --> 01:42:51.030
<v Speaker 2>Remember that show later.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

2311
01:42:51.060 --> 01:42:54.030
<v Speaker 2>he had left and they were looking for </v>
<v Speaker 2>new hosts,</v>

2312
01:42:54.270 --> 01:42:59.270
<v Speaker 2>so they would do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is have a different person who hosts it </v>

2313
01:42:59.270 --> 01:43:01.221
<v Speaker 2>for a week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is when I was on news radio and I </v>

2314
01:43:01.221 --> 01:43:03.360
<v Speaker 2>was hosting it for a week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I was talking to Maurice and uh,</v>

2315
01:43:03.530 --> 01:43:05.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would always call me Joseph Joseph,</v>

2316
01:43:05.400 --> 01:43:06.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to do that TV thing.</v>

2317
01:43:06.751 --> 01:43:07.770
<v Speaker 2>Let's do that TV thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2318
01:43:07.771 --> 01:43:08.220
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2319
01:43:08.221 --> 01:43:13.221
<v Speaker 2>we'll do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm thinking this poor fucking guy is </v>

2320
01:43:13.221 --> 01:43:13.221
<v Speaker 2>going to go fight Mark Mark Coleman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>

2321
01:43:13.221 --> 01:43:14.910
<v Speaker 2>so calm and oblivious like he doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>even.</v>

2322
01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:17.550
<v Speaker 2>Does he realize who he's fighting?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does he know?</v>

2323
01:43:17.551 --> 01:43:18.570
<v Speaker 2>He's?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course he knew,</v>

2324
01:43:18.750 --> 01:43:20.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was the one that was ridiculous.</v>

2325
01:43:20.550 --> 01:43:24.190
<v Speaker 2>Maurice was so calm and relaxed because </v>
<v Speaker 2>he had insane cardio me.</v>

2326
01:43:24.220 --> 01:43:28.080
<v Speaker 2>Maurice would say slim swim lap after </v>
<v Speaker 2>lap.</v>

2327
01:43:28.081 --> 01:43:32.520
<v Speaker 2>I mean he was just dedicated to cardio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was a good big part of his training</v>

2328
01:43:32.521 --> 01:43:37.521
<v Speaker 2>regiment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So his idea was just ride the storm in </v>

2329
01:43:37.521 --> 01:43:38.160
<v Speaker 2>the beginning and then start getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>that big fucker tired out.</v>

2330
01:43:38.380 --> 01:43:41.760
<v Speaker 2>Like he was the first guy to realize you</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't really be that big man.</v>

2331
01:43:42.060 --> 01:43:44.850
<v Speaker 2>You can't sustain that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Matt Hume with him too,</v>

2332
01:43:44.851 --> 01:43:45.950
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

2333
01:43:46.170 --> 01:43:47.240
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He hadn't Matt Hume,</v>

2334
01:43:47.250 --> 01:43:52.250
<v Speaker 2>any had world class kickboxing skills.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maurice was the first guy to fight in </v>

2335
01:43:53.301 --> 01:43:58.301
<v Speaker 2>the UFC first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Got To fight and Emma had ligit world </v>

2336
01:43:58.301 --> 01:44:02.021
<v Speaker 2>championship kickboxing skills.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And remember when he fought cone and </v>

2337
01:44:02.021 --> 01:44:03.320
<v Speaker 2>Sylvia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was the first head kick.</v>

2338
01:44:03.320 --> 01:44:05.240
<v Speaker 2>Keto we ever saw.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A high level of fight,</v>

2339
01:44:05.480 --> 01:44:08.670
<v Speaker 2>especially against a Brazilian jujitsu </v>
<v Speaker 2>black belt like Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.</v>

2340
01:44:08.730 --> 01:44:11.420
<v Speaker 2>Blackbelt was like having an iron man </v>
<v Speaker 2>suit back then.</v>

2341
01:44:11.450 --> 01:44:13.400
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy's got a Brazilian Jujitsu,</v>

2342
01:44:13.480 --> 01:44:18.480
<v Speaker 2>black belt baby can't be beaten.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maurice fucking bounced this Shin Off </v>

2343
01:44:18.711 --> 01:44:23.711
<v Speaker 2>Kona Anz head and that was like a new </v>
<v Speaker 2>era and then fought coleman in the next </v>

2344
01:44:24.201 --> 01:44:29.201
<v Speaker 2>fight and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just fucking dominated coleman down the </v>

2345
01:44:29.201 --> 01:44:30.710
<v Speaker 2>stretch and won the title.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like one of the biggest upsets ever.</v>

2346
01:44:31.490 --> 01:44:34.860
<v Speaker 2>But detour was in the Mark Coleman </v>
<v Speaker 2>school detour.</v>

2347
01:44:34.890 --> 01:44:36.710
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think about veto or now looks like a</v>

2348
01:44:36.711 --> 01:44:37.850
<v Speaker 2>welterweight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2349
01:44:37.851 --> 01:44:39.530
<v Speaker 2>now that he's off testosterone </v>
<v Speaker 2>replacement,</v>

2350
01:44:39.531 --> 01:44:44.531
<v Speaker 2>literally looks like he's a one 70 </v>
<v Speaker 2>pounder in between camps and back then </v>

2351
01:44:44.780 --> 01:44:48.170
<v Speaker 2>was just fucking huge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>20 years old,</v>

2352
01:44:48.760 --> 01:44:50.720
<v Speaker 2>20 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gigantic.</v>

2353
01:44:51.080 --> 01:44:55.400
<v Speaker 2>And Randy came in and smashed them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just smashed them,</v>

2354
01:44:55.401 --> 01:44:58.670
<v Speaker 2>just ground him out and just beat him </v>
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>

2355
01:44:58.910 --> 01:45:01.450
<v Speaker 2>And I remember the end of the fight him </v>
<v Speaker 2>on top of Vituro,</v>

2356
01:45:01.730 --> 01:45:05.230
<v Speaker 2>relentlessly pounding on him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boom,</v>

2357
01:45:05.231 --> 01:45:10.231

2358
01:45:10.231 --> 01:45:10.231
<v Speaker 2>Mike Tyson getting beat by buster </v>
<v Speaker 2>Douglas.</v>

<v Speaker 2>really be happening.</v>

2361
01:45:14.290 --> 01:45:19.040
<v Speaker 2>Change via towards life for years after </v>
<v Speaker 2>that to Vitara long time to recover from</v>

<v Speaker 2>ever been.</v>

2367
01:45:28.160 --> 01:45:32.510
<v Speaker 2>But still that randy fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that changes a lot of shit.</v>

2368
01:45:34.240 --> 01:45:35.450
<v Speaker 2>So you were involved back then?</v>

<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you knew them before you knew them?</v>

2384
01:46:16.251 --> 01:46:18.470
<v Speaker 3>When Randy first came to the UFC for </v>
<v Speaker 3>like years,</v>

2385
01:46:18.471 --> 01:46:22.520
<v Speaker 3>so I knew them years before we had ever </v>
<v Speaker 3>heard of fighting or randy first saw the</v>

2386
01:46:22.521 --> 01:46:23.690
<v Speaker 3>UFC went.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

2387
01:46:23.691 --> 01:46:24.260
<v Speaker 3>Who would ever do</v>

2388
01:46:24.460 --> 01:46:24.750
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>

2389
01:46:26.220 --> 01:46:30.210
<v Speaker 3>This is like 90.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I first met Randy in 1992.</v>

2390
01:46:30.211 --> 01:46:32.890
<v Speaker 3>Him and Dan's still had mullets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's awesome.</v>

2391
01:46:33.120 --> 01:46:34.510
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is the.</v>

2392
01:46:34.550 --> 01:46:36.330
<v Speaker 3>So they fought years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>years later.</v>

2393
01:46:36.810 --> 01:46:39.560
<v Speaker 3>These are the guys I started do </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything I do now is cut,</v>

2394
01:46:39.570 --> 01:46:44.130
<v Speaker 3>developed from the training sense of </v>
<v Speaker 3>these guys got me started with that from</v>

2395
01:46:44.131 --> 01:46:47.130
<v Speaker 3>the management sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was some your managers through Kevin.</v>

2396
01:46:47.131 --> 01:46:52.131
<v Speaker 3>I became close with Chandra and jeff and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they kind of were graded at least </v>

2397
01:46:52.681 --> 01:46:54.690
<v Speaker 3>letting me see how it really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2398
01:46:54.780 --> 01:46:57.780
<v Speaker 3>like a top notch entertainment manager,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do they operate,</v>

2399
01:46:58.200 --> 01:47:03.200
<v Speaker 3>how they handled things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So are these two really interesting </v>

2400
01:47:03.200 --> 01:47:03.900
<v Speaker 3>people to draw from to create this </v>
<v Speaker 3>career that I have now.</v>

2401
01:47:03.901 --> 01:47:05.760
<v Speaker 3>And then I have my healthcare background</v>
<v Speaker 3>on top of it,</v>

2402
01:47:05.761 --> 01:47:07.850
<v Speaker 3>which you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>management is,</v>

2403
01:47:07.851 --> 01:47:09.750
<v Speaker 3>is client service,</v>
<v Speaker 3>customer service,</v>

2404
01:47:09.751 --> 01:47:12.360
<v Speaker 3>really service the person that you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>working with,</v>

2405
01:47:12.361 --> 01:47:17.361
<v Speaker 3>which is very similar to chiropractic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the mindset for me was very similar </v>

2406
01:47:17.361 --> 01:47:21.800
<v Speaker 3>and on top of it all I found out that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>had a real knack for marketing business </v>

2407
01:47:21.800 --> 01:47:23.610
<v Speaker 3>and negotiating and it took a long time </v>
<v Speaker 3>to develop.</v>

2408
01:47:23.611 --> 01:47:24.750
<v Speaker 3>But I ended up here.</v>

2409
01:47:25.390 --> 01:47:30.390
<v Speaker 2>Well Sandra and jeffers similar to your </v>
<v Speaker 2>approach to training and managing,</v>

2410
01:47:31.130 --> 01:47:36.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>developing athletes and like I've been </v>

2411
01:47:36.130 --> 01:47:36.130
<v Speaker 2>with Jeff since I was an open micro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2412
01:47:36.370 --> 01:47:41.370
<v Speaker 2>Jeff and I have been together for I want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to sell at 23 years,</v>

2413
01:47:42.200 --> 01:47:44.920
<v Speaker 2>but he got me fresh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just like,</v>

2414
01:47:44.921 --> 01:47:47.270
<v Speaker 2>I just had some potential,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2415
01:47:47.271 --> 01:47:50.260
<v Speaker 2>and along the way as advised me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2416
01:47:50.261 --> 01:47:50.890
<v Speaker 2>and we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2417
01:47:50.950 --> 01:47:55.950
<v Speaker 2>we've made some bad turns and tried to </v>
<v Speaker 2>figure things out and made some calls,</v>

2418
01:47:56.540 --> 01:47:57.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2419
01:47:57.331 --> 01:48:02.331
<v Speaker 2>one is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially when it's something as open </v>

2420
01:48:02.331 --> 01:48:02.980
<v Speaker 2>ended as a stand up comedy career,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like who the fuck knows</v>

2421
01:48:03.640 --> 01:48:06.160
<v Speaker 3>a very similar to [inaudible] in that </v>
<v Speaker 3>sense.</v>

2422
01:48:06.850 --> 01:48:08.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well you never know where it's gonna go.</v>

2423
01:48:08.230 --> 01:48:13.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's more options for stand up </v>

2424
01:48:13.230 --> 01:48:14.590
<v Speaker 2>for a fight with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's also victory.</v>

2425
01:48:14.620 --> 01:48:15.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is it.</v>

2426
01:48:15.970 --> 01:48:17.800
<v Speaker 2>Like you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to figure out how to win,</v>

2427
01:48:18.070 --> 01:48:23.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a standup comic because you've got </v>

2428
01:48:23.070 --> 01:48:23.070
<v Speaker 2>to figure out how to be funny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you have to.</v>

2429
01:48:23.070 --> 01:48:24.010
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is a lot of different ways </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be funny.</v>

2430
01:48:24.160 --> 01:48:29.160
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's just a lot of different ways to </v>

2431
01:48:29.160 --> 01:48:29.160
<v Speaker 2>win.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2432
01:48:29.160 --> 01:48:29.160
<v Speaker 2>But you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

2433
01:48:29.160 --> 01:48:33.580
<v Speaker 2>here's a perfect example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's some guys who just will not be </v>

2434
01:48:33.580 --> 01:48:33.580
<v Speaker 2>funny if they're following the wrong </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy.</v>

2435
01:48:33.730 --> 01:48:36.910
<v Speaker 2>Like if you follow a super wild high </v>
<v Speaker 2>energy guy,</v>

2436
01:48:36.911 --> 01:48:40.240
<v Speaker 2>let's say like Sam Kinison,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like perfect example,</v>

2437
01:48:40.241 --> 01:48:42.700
<v Speaker 2>like Mitch Hedberg is one of my all time</v>
<v Speaker 2>favorite Comedians,</v>

2438
01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:48.000
<v Speaker 2>but Mitch Hedberg is very slow paced and</v>
<v Speaker 2>had a very like a silly style.</v>

2439
01:48:48.550 --> 01:48:50.560
<v Speaker 2>He had to like silly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very silly style.</v>

2440
01:48:50.830 --> 01:48:55.830
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I eat a piece of carefree gum half an </v>

2441
01:48:55.830 --> 01:48:56.890
<v Speaker 2>hour later.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was still worried it never kicked in.</v>

2442
01:48:57.210 --> 01:49:01.450
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like something silly and funny.</v>

2443
01:49:01.660 --> 01:49:06.660
<v Speaker 2>But if he followed a guy like Kennedy </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was fucking play playback,</v>

2444
01:49:08.170 --> 01:49:11.030
<v Speaker 2>you would probably not buy into it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd be like,</v>

2445
01:49:11.650 --> 01:49:12.700
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is too different.</v>

2446
01:49:12.730 --> 01:49:15.220
<v Speaker 2>It's too slow paced.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a band.</v>

2447
01:49:15.370 --> 01:49:20.370
<v Speaker 2>Say like if guns and roses went on and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then right after guns and roses,</v>

2448
01:49:20.620 --> 01:49:25.500
<v Speaker 2>some like ballad guy went on in the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>crowds to follow James Brown.</v>

2449
01:49:26.250 --> 01:49:31.250
<v Speaker 2>Perfect example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one wanted to follow a little </v>

2450
01:49:31.250 --> 01:49:31.250
<v Speaker 2>Richard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one wanted to follow.</v>

2451
01:49:31.250 --> 01:49:32.610
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of guys like that.</v>

2452
01:49:32.640 --> 01:49:35.980
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jerry Lee Lewis famously lit the fucking</v>

2453
01:49:36.040 --> 01:49:41.040
<v Speaker 2>piano on fire after he played because he</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't want to Chuck Barry to go on </v>

2454
01:49:41.040 --> 01:49:44.120
<v Speaker 2>after him and he said to Chuck Berry </v>
<v Speaker 2>followed that motherfucker like,</v>

2455
01:49:44.530 --> 01:49:47.980
<v Speaker 2>that's like a famous story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He might have said do</v>

2456
01:49:47.980 --> 01:49:49.270
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>depending on who you ask,</v>

2457
01:49:49.570 --> 01:49:51.970
<v Speaker 1>but bottom line is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2458
01:49:52.180 --> 01:49:57.180
<v Speaker 1>there's certain guys that like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a certain impact that they </v>

2459
01:49:57.180 --> 01:49:59.140
<v Speaker 1>would have on that fucking stage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guys like Chuck Berry,</v>

2460
01:49:59.680 --> 01:50:01.720
<v Speaker 1>Little Richard Guys like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2461
01:50:02.290 --> 01:50:07.290
<v Speaker 1>down the line,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's been a lot of like James Brown </v>

2462
01:50:07.290 --> 01:50:09.871
<v Speaker 1>is probably the best example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just what the fuck and follow James </v>

2463
01:50:09.871 --> 01:50:09.871
<v Speaker 1>Brown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>James Brown.</v>

2464
01:50:10.010 --> 01:50:11.080
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2465
01:50:11.100 --> 01:50:12.460
<v Speaker 1>you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just can't.</v>

2466
01:50:12.500 --> 01:50:16.960
<v Speaker 1>It's like fucking shows over the career </v>
<v Speaker 1>trajectory.</v>

2467
01:50:16.961 --> 01:50:19.390
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no roadmap to this is it?</v>

2468
01:50:19.480 --> 01:50:20.410
<v Speaker 1>It's a fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2469
01:50:20.411 --> 01:50:22.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have as a community,</v>

2470
01:50:22.250 --> 01:50:24.190
<v Speaker 1>you and your manager,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you make these decisions.</v>

2471
01:50:24.220 --> 01:50:26.170
<v Speaker 1>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not even about getting.</v>

2472
01:50:26.320 --> 01:50:28.600
<v Speaker 1>Some aren't gonna work out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what you do after that,</v>

2473
01:50:28.630 --> 01:50:33.630
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's similar in the fact that you're </v>

2474
01:50:33.630 --> 01:50:36.481
<v Speaker 1>trying to develop this overall thing and</v>
<v Speaker 1>optimize who you are in how you express </v>

2475
01:50:37.541 --> 01:50:41.320
<v Speaker 1>it through this thing that you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this thing that you're doing in Emma,</v>

2476
01:50:41.360 --> 01:50:44.530
<v Speaker 1>it's obviously it's a competition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's very different,</v>

2477
01:50:44.590 --> 01:50:46.570
<v Speaker 1>but in the sense that you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>develop.</v>

2478
01:50:46.570 --> 01:50:51.570
<v Speaker 1>Conor Mcgregor's done a great job of </v>
<v Speaker 1>letting us know who he is very easy to </v>

2479
01:50:51.570 --> 01:50:52.990
<v Speaker 1>pick up on that and either like it or </v>
<v Speaker 1>dislike,</v>

2480
01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:54.970
<v Speaker 1>you know exactly who it is and it's kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of fun.</v>

2481
01:50:55.720 --> 01:50:59.470
<v Speaker 1>Have to help someone develop a style and</v>
<v Speaker 1>a persona and kind of.</v>

2482
01:50:59.471 --> 01:51:01.580
<v Speaker 1>I hate to use the word brand when </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about some of the.</v>

2483
01:51:01.840 --> 01:51:04.370
<v Speaker 1>Something that's unique about them that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they put out there.</v>

2484
01:51:04.450 --> 01:51:06.130
<v Speaker 1>In that sense it's similar as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>comedian,</v>

2485
01:51:06.131 --> 01:51:09.610
<v Speaker 1>are you Sam kinison type or you write,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2486
01:51:09.611 --> 01:51:11.710
<v Speaker 1>how do you figure out who to be you </v>
<v Speaker 1>best?</v>

2487
01:51:11.740 --> 01:51:16.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a good manager is going to help you </v>

2488
01:51:16.740 --> 01:51:16.740
<v Speaker 1>in that process along the way and that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2489
01:51:16.740 --> 01:51:20.850
<v Speaker 1>It's a unique relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll never have a relationship like </v>

2490
01:51:20.850 --> 01:51:21.460
<v Speaker 1>the one you have with your manager.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's totally unique.</v>

2491
01:51:22.120 --> 01:51:23.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a very.</v>

2492
01:51:23.501 --> 01:51:28.501
<v Speaker 1>It's a very unique relationship if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a manager like you that is like </v>

2493
01:51:28.870 --> 01:51:32.500
<v Speaker 1>really dedicated to developing an </v>
<v Speaker 1>athlete from,</v>

2494
01:51:32.560 --> 01:51:34.780
<v Speaker 1>from the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the start of their career.</v>

2495
01:51:35.020 --> 01:51:40.020
<v Speaker 1>It's like seeing what it is that takes </v>
<v Speaker 1>them to reach their optimum level of </v>

2496
01:51:40.020 --> 01:51:43.240
<v Speaker 1>performance and that changes to how you </v>
<v Speaker 1>manage someone in the beginning.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gabby Garcia,</v>

2510
01:52:18.550 --> 01:52:23.550
<v Speaker 1>Jack like Tyron Woodley jacked and she's</v>
<v Speaker 1>a woman so it's all natural hundred </v>

2511
01:52:24.550 --> 01:52:28.990
<v Speaker 1>percent and she's got to lose weight to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get down to two 20.</v>

2512
01:52:30.270 --> 01:52:31.660
<v Speaker 1>She's getting hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's her contract.</v>

2513
01:52:31.661 --> 01:52:33.030
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess apparently it was like her.</v>

2514
01:52:33.070 --> 01:52:36.730
<v Speaker 1>She has to be 20 and she's finding a </v>
<v Speaker 1>woman was 135 pounds.</v>

2515
01:52:37.240 --> 01:52:37.930
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at it,</v>

2516
01:52:37.931 --> 01:52:41.200
<v Speaker 1>look at it there with vandelay by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

2517
01:52:41.201 --> 01:52:46.040
<v Speaker 1>That's vandelay in between fights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vandelay fought [inaudible] 85.</v>

2518
01:52:46.060 --> 01:52:48.130
<v Speaker 2>He never weighed [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chelsea.</v>

2519
01:52:48.150 --> 01:52:49.790
<v Speaker 2>All it did was lift weights for that </v>
<v Speaker 2>Tuesday.</v>

2520
01:52:49.791 --> 01:52:54.791
<v Speaker 2>He's pumped up right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's been in the waiting room and look </v>

2521
01:52:54.791 --> 01:52:55.450
<v Speaker 2>at her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he was probably two.</v>

2522
01:52:55.480 --> 01:52:58.060
<v Speaker 2>Oh five to 10 back then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2523
01:52:58.100 --> 01:53:02.000
<v Speaker 2>in between fights and she's just </v>
<v Speaker 2>enormous.</v>

2524
01:53:02.240 --> 01:53:07.240
<v Speaker 2>Look at her neck and face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Totally looks like a woman to doesn't </v>

2525
01:53:07.240 --> 01:53:10.610
<v Speaker 2>only.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He says any extra testosterone in their </v>

2526
01:53:10.610 --> 01:53:11.660
<v Speaker 2>body at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kidding.</v>

2527
01:53:13.240 --> 01:53:15.140
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a fucking house.</v>

2528
01:53:15.290 --> 01:53:16.820
<v Speaker 2>That's not good for your clitoris.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2529
01:53:16.821 --> 01:53:21.821
<v Speaker 2>It does not do strange things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never seen a clitoris on </v>

2530
01:53:21.821 --> 01:53:21.821
<v Speaker 2>testosterone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I can't imagine that's good,</v>

2531
01:53:21.821 --> 01:53:24.920
<v Speaker 2>but do not have a computer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do not connected to the Internet.</v>

2532
01:53:24.921 --> 01:53:26.300
<v Speaker 2>I have never.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like today,</v>

2533
01:53:26.301 --> 01:53:27.410
<v Speaker 2>this afternoon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'll look it up.</v>

2534
01:53:27.411 --> 01:53:29.090
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can show you right now.</v>

2535
01:53:29.750 --> 01:53:32.690
<v Speaker 2>You want to see it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's up your shell or however you want</v>

2536
01:53:32.691 --> 01:53:33.200
<v Speaker 2>to take this.</v>

2537
01:53:33.300 --> 01:53:36.110
<v Speaker 2>Much of the rest of the blue get kicked </v>
<v Speaker 2>off at ustream.</v>

2538
01:53:36.620 --> 01:53:38.240
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it grows like a penis.</v>

2539
01:53:38.850 --> 01:53:41.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which makes you think like if a dude has</v>

2540
01:53:41.031 --> 01:53:46.031
<v Speaker 2>a little deck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if he just takes a shit load of test </v>

2541
01:53:46.031 --> 01:53:46.031
<v Speaker 2>every day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a few years was Dick Rowe.</v>

2542
01:53:46.580 --> 01:53:51.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure there's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People have got to know the answer to </v>

2543
01:53:51.580 --> 01:53:51.580
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone's got to know the answer.</v>

2544
01:53:51.580 --> 01:53:55.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine grow a little new for </v>

2545
01:53:55.090 --> 01:53:56.360
<v Speaker 2>people we could call an ask for at </v>
<v Speaker 2>least.</v>

2546
01:53:56.390 --> 01:53:59.690
<v Speaker 2>How dare you be so conservative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>

2547
01:53:59.691 --> 01:54:04.691
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is an interesting subject to </v>

2548
01:54:04.691 --> 01:54:04.691
<v Speaker 2>because of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2549
01:54:04.691 --> 01:54:08.470
<v Speaker 2>what's going on now with the eliminated </v>
<v Speaker 2>completely eliminated testosterone </v>

2550
01:54:08.470 --> 01:54:11.060
<v Speaker 2>replacement therapy and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Vittorias the whipping boy when it comes</v>

2551
01:54:11.061 --> 01:54:14.090
<v Speaker 2>to that because cause he had the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>spectacular results.</v>

2552
01:54:14.670 --> 01:54:19.670
<v Speaker 2>You look at how vituro looked when he </v>
<v Speaker 2>fought rich Franklin whom one first </v>

2553
01:54:19.670 --> 01:54:23.671
<v Speaker 2>round Kol.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you look at his body and then you </v>

2554
01:54:23.671 --> 01:54:23.671
<v Speaker 2>look at rich Franklin when he fought </v>
<v Speaker 2>rockhold,</v>

2555
01:54:23.671 --> 01:54:28.120
<v Speaker 2>if our best bang when he fought Dan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're looking at this jacked fucking </v>

2556
01:54:28.120 --> 01:54:32.501
<v Speaker 2>monster with muscles on his teeth and </v>
<v Speaker 2>just ultra super confident it looks like</v>

2557
01:54:32.701 --> 01:54:36.470
<v Speaker 2>he can't be beat and so many people </v>
<v Speaker 2>attribute that to,</v>

2558
01:54:37.330 --> 01:54:38.960
<v Speaker 2>to taking testosterone.</v>

2559
01:54:39.020 --> 01:54:41.120
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's unfortunate.</v>

2560
01:54:41.330 --> 01:54:46.330
<v Speaker 2>But it's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's unfortunate because like men veto </v>

2561
01:54:46.330 --> 01:54:47.330
<v Speaker 2>accomplish so much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think those,</v>

2562
01:54:47.750 --> 01:54:52.130
<v Speaker 2>those three fights where some of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>most impressive chaos I've ever seen him</v>

2563
01:54:52.131 --> 01:54:54.020
<v Speaker 2>to stop and Dan and the first round like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2564
01:54:54.140 --> 01:54:59.140
<v Speaker 2>who fucks ever done that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who the fuck is ever dominated Dan like </v>

2565
01:54:59.140 --> 01:54:59.140
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2566
01:54:59.140 --> 01:55:03.040
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Him and Dan was on testosterone at the </v>

2567
01:55:03.040 --> 01:55:05.831
<v Speaker 2>same time too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know him stopping rockhold like </v>

2568
01:55:05.831 --> 01:55:05.831
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Him Head kicking bis bank.</v>

2569
01:55:05.831 --> 01:55:10.590
<v Speaker 2>Many people have mentioned that Dan and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually did his therapeutic use </v>

2570
01:55:11.331 --> 01:55:14.780
<v Speaker 2>exemption,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I got the ball rolling with that.</v>

2571
01:55:15.200 --> 01:55:20.200
<v Speaker 2>And when we tested it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm sure he wouldn't mind me saying </v>

2572
01:55:20.200 --> 01:55:22.451
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was off the charts in the wrong </v>

2573
01:55:22.451 --> 01:55:22.451
<v Speaker 2>direction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You wanted to close the numbers?</v>

2574
01:55:22.451 --> 01:55:25.080
<v Speaker 2>I think the scale is two 50,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two 11 [inaudible] eight.</v>

2575
01:55:25.670 --> 01:55:30.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that is higher than allister is </v>

2576
01:55:30.670 --> 01:55:30.700
<v Speaker 2>right now and the higher than Vittorias </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now I'm sure.</v>

2577
01:55:30.701 --> 01:55:33.740
<v Speaker 2>But Dan also never.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've I know Dan's father.</v>

2578
01:55:33.741 --> 01:55:36.650
<v Speaker 2>Dan's dad had like a 550 pound bench </v>
<v Speaker 2>press.</v>

2579
01:55:36.950 --> 01:55:39.830
<v Speaker 2>His,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his little sister is a sophomore in high</v>

2580
01:55:39.831 --> 01:55:41.840
<v Speaker 2>school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could hit a golf ball 300 yards.</v>

2581
01:55:42.120 --> 01:55:44.100
<v Speaker 2>You look at Gross,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when I used</v>

2582
01:55:44.100 --> 01:55:46.020
<v Speaker 1>to do soft tissue work I did on Dan and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Randy.</v>

2583
01:55:46.021 --> 01:55:49.860
<v Speaker 1>Dan was five times the effort.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He is so dense.</v>

2584
01:55:49.950 --> 01:55:50.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a weird guy.</v>

2585
01:55:50.820 --> 01:55:55.820
<v Speaker 1>You put your arm on his back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you like while you're pictures with </v>

2586
01:55:55.820 --> 01:55:58.990
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like taking a picture with the </v>

2587
01:55:58.990 --> 01:55:58.990
<v Speaker 1>tree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your tree.</v>

2588
01:55:58.990 --> 01:56:00.930
<v Speaker 1>You're not like the rest of us for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when I did that,</v>

2589
01:56:00.931 --> 01:56:05.931
<v Speaker 1>I also was so paranoid because I can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>be the guy to fuck up Dan Henderson's </v>

2590
01:56:05.931 --> 01:56:07.980
<v Speaker 1>career with a failed steroid tests </v>
<v Speaker 1>called the UFC.</v>

2591
01:56:07.981 --> 01:56:12.540
<v Speaker 1>I called the Invest Athletic Commission.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dragged him down there twice a week to</v>

2592
01:56:12.541 --> 01:56:14.010
<v Speaker 1>get blood tests.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't want to do.</v>

2593
01:56:14.011 --> 01:56:14.720
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nah,</v>

2594
01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:18.270
<v Speaker 1>if my name was on this one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now is this testing.</v>

2595
01:56:18.271 --> 01:56:21.240
<v Speaker 1>Sorry to interrupt you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this testing we tested 200.</v>

2596
01:56:21.270 --> 01:56:26.270
<v Speaker 1>That was his level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is this in camp or is it out of camp is </v>

2597
01:56:26.270 --> 01:56:26.270
<v Speaker 1>just out of camp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2598
01:56:26.270 --> 01:56:28.510
<v Speaker 1>So it's not like hard training where </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything gets Jack.</v>

2599
01:56:28.520 --> 01:56:31.350
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What made you want to test him?</v>

2600
01:56:33.540 --> 01:56:34.350
<v Speaker 1>I just said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2601
01:56:34.890 --> 01:56:37.380
<v Speaker 1>you're not like it used to be and that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>what he said.</v>

2602
01:56:37.680 --> 01:56:39.950
<v Speaker 1>Dennis being overtrained.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well what did you look for it?</v>

2603
01:56:40.540 --> 01:56:42.900
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're just not quite right.</v>

2604
01:56:42.910 --> 01:56:47.910
<v Speaker 1>And 34 maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's 35.</v>

2605
01:56:49.110 --> 01:56:51.090
<v Speaker 1>There could be a natural slowing down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was very,</v>

2606
01:56:51.091 --> 01:56:55.410
<v Speaker 1>very low and the one thing he was very </v>
<v Speaker 1>adamant because Dan never done any drugs</v>

2607
01:56:55.411 --> 01:56:57.060
<v Speaker 1>in his life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'll drink some bad light beer,</v>

2608
01:56:57.061 --> 01:56:59.160
<v Speaker 1>but that's about the extent of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Peer.</v>

2609
01:56:59.280 --> 01:57:04.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he never abused anything when he was </v>

2610
01:57:04.280 --> 01:57:06.180
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We tested him regularly so I knew you.</v>

2611
01:57:06.181 --> 01:57:07.620
<v Speaker 1>You checked a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes up,</v>

2612
01:57:07.621 --> 01:57:10.980
<v Speaker 1>come back down again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was never out of a range that was off</v>

2613
01:57:10.981 --> 01:57:12.680
<v Speaker 1>that scale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if there,</v>

2614
01:57:12.681 --> 01:57:17.681
<v Speaker 1>if the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the arrangement from two 50 to 1100 </v>

2615
01:57:17.681 --> 01:57:20.001
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we would go to a thousand in a couple </v>

2616
01:57:20.001 --> 01:57:20.001
<v Speaker 1>days later it drops down again.</v>

2617
01:57:20.001 --> 01:57:21.060
<v Speaker 1>So he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he never abused it in that sense.</v>

2618
01:57:21.340 --> 01:57:23.550
<v Speaker 1>And there's a lot of other guys he would</v>
<v Speaker 1>speculate,</v>

2619
01:57:23.880 --> 01:57:25.830
<v Speaker 1>did it very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very opposite thing.</v>

2620
01:57:25.831 --> 01:57:30.831
<v Speaker 1>They took a whole bunch of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dan took a prescribed medication that </v>

2621
01:57:30.831 --> 01:57:34.620
<v Speaker 1>was really needed and never went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but above levels that were not even high</v>

2622
01:57:34.621 --> 01:57:36.450
<v Speaker 1>levels for normal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just really,</v>

2623
01:57:36.720 --> 01:57:39.900
<v Speaker 1>let's just bring you up with just a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit so you can recover.</v>

2624
01:57:40.260 --> 01:57:45.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that to lump him in with </v>

2625
01:57:45.260 --> 01:57:46.200
<v Speaker 1>someone who may be throughout their </v>
<v Speaker 1>career,</v>

2626
01:57:46.201 --> 01:57:51.201
<v Speaker 1>abuse it in much different ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's unfair and it's unfortunate that </v>

2627
01:57:51.201 --> 01:57:51.240
<v Speaker 1>guys like Dan or thrown into that </v>
<v Speaker 1>category.</v>

2628
01:57:51.640 --> 01:57:53.940
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even if you look at dance weight has</v>

2629
01:57:53.941 --> 01:57:58.400
<v Speaker 1>not changed by more than four pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His physique didn't change either.</v>

2630
01:57:58.680 --> 01:58:00.270
<v Speaker 1>Is He in his weight?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Didn't change.</v>

2631
01:58:00.271 --> 01:58:00.730
<v Speaker 1>He was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2632
01:58:00.750 --> 01:58:05.750
<v Speaker 1>I remember when he was 20.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the heaviest I ever got was 205 </v>

2633
01:58:05.750 --> 01:58:05.750
<v Speaker 1>pounds.</v>

2634
01:58:05.750 --> 01:58:08.490
<v Speaker 1>And he was like 19 or 20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>working out like crazy and I don't think</v>

2635
01:58:08.491 --> 01:58:10.980
<v Speaker 1>he ever weighed in at 205 pounds on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>scale.</v>

2636
01:58:10.981 --> 01:58:12.210
<v Speaker 1>And Emma?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2637
01:58:12.240 --> 01:58:17.130
<v Speaker 1>he was always like two or three in lower</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] and 40 [inaudible].</v>

2638
01:58:17.190 --> 01:58:17.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Dan,</v>

2639
01:58:17.851 --> 01:58:20.760
<v Speaker 1>Dan never abused Denton.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A medication that was necessarily.</v>

2640
01:58:20.761 --> 01:58:25.761
<v Speaker 1>Dan did not abuse steroids in any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what is the argument obviously is </v>

2641
01:58:25.830 --> 01:58:30.510
<v Speaker 1>should that medication be allowed?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you're saying a medication that's</v>

2642
01:58:30.511 --> 01:58:35.511
<v Speaker 1>necessary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but is that just your body telling you </v>

2643
01:58:35.511 --> 01:58:36.150
<v Speaker 1>to hang it up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that your body's saying like,</v>

2644
01:58:36.151 --> 01:58:36.620
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2645
01:58:36.690 --> 01:58:39.840
<v Speaker 1>look if you want to do testosterone for </v>
<v Speaker 1>something else for life,</v>

2646
01:58:39.841 --> 01:58:44.841
<v Speaker 1>but if your body from the abuse of </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting is your,</v>

2647
01:58:45.550 --> 01:58:48.010
<v Speaker 1>you essentially your pituitary is not </v>
<v Speaker 1>functioning properly.</v>

2648
01:58:48.011 --> 01:58:50.700
<v Speaker 1>That could be a big part of what's going</v>
<v Speaker 1>on and getting hit.</v>

2649
01:58:50.870 --> 01:58:53.080
<v Speaker 1>I get the arguments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you could say the same things.</v>

2650
01:58:53.080 --> 01:58:56.750
<v Speaker 1>If you need surgery and you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say you need insulin,</v>

2651
01:58:56.760 --> 01:58:58.790
<v Speaker 1>you develop type one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>type two,</v>

2652
01:58:58.791 --> 01:59:01.080
<v Speaker 1>type II diabetics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never fighting them.</v>

2653
01:59:01.081 --> 01:59:03.880
<v Speaker 1>I may though do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>None of one or two.</v>

2654
01:59:03.881 --> 01:59:04.720
<v Speaker 1>But in general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2655
01:59:04.721 --> 01:59:06.020
<v Speaker 1>But let's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we're gonna,</v>

2656
01:59:06.070 --> 01:59:07.440
<v Speaker 1>if we're gonna go down this road,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2657
01:59:07.441 --> 01:59:07.990
<v Speaker 1>Say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2658
01:59:08.320 --> 01:59:13.320
<v Speaker 1>should you take this medication because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a harder with me or something </v>

2659
01:59:13.320 --> 01:59:13.320
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2660
01:59:13.320 --> 01:59:16.300
<v Speaker 1>there's a whole bunch of things that go </v>
<v Speaker 1>yet we have medications for this reason.</v>

2661
01:59:16.630 --> 01:59:18.700
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately the line gets blurred so </v>
<v Speaker 1>quickly.</v>

2662
01:59:18.701 --> 01:59:20.860
<v Speaker 1>You have a guy like Dan who was honest </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it,</v>

2663
01:59:20.861 --> 01:59:23.110
<v Speaker 1>who went through the channels before we </v>
<v Speaker 1>did anything,</v>

2664
01:59:23.550 --> 01:59:26.380
<v Speaker 1>talk to the UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk to the commission.</v>

2665
01:59:26.410 --> 01:59:31.410
<v Speaker 1>I had a when we wait and hit a binder of</v>
<v Speaker 1>every single had every single test done </v>

2666
01:59:32.201 --> 01:59:37.201
<v Speaker 1>that day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we were very well prepared for that </v>

2667
01:59:37.201 --> 01:59:37.201
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in that sense,</v>

2668
01:59:37.201 --> 01:59:40.861
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that guys should absolutely be </v>

2669
01:59:40.861 --> 01:59:40.861
<v Speaker 1>able to.</v>

2670
01:59:40.861 --> 01:59:43.470
<v Speaker 1>And Dan was one of the first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think Dan was the first or second </v>

2671
01:59:43.470 --> 01:59:46.800
<v Speaker 1>therapeutic use exemption in Nevada.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then came the controversy,</v>

2672
01:59:47.680 --> 01:59:52.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>slowly necessarily what's up guys </v>

2673
01:59:52.680 --> 01:59:52.680
<v Speaker 1>abusing it was abuse it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2674
01:59:52.680 --> 01:59:54.820
<v Speaker 1>Slowly but surely we started seeing guys</v>
<v Speaker 1>get tested.</v>

2675
01:59:54.821 --> 01:59:59.821
<v Speaker 1>Nate Marquardt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they pull them off with the fight where </v>

2676
01:59:59.821 --> 01:59:59.821
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in their words,</v>

2677
01:59:59.821 --> 02:00:04.680
<v Speaker 1>dangerously high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had a dangerously high testosterone </v>

2678
02:00:04.680 --> 02:00:04.680
<v Speaker 1>count.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mean I don't know what the number was,</v>

2679
02:00:04.680 --> 02:00:08.260
<v Speaker 1>but apparently it was significant enough</v>
<v Speaker 1>that a doctor advised him to not be able</v>

2680
02:00:08.261 --> 02:00:10.030
<v Speaker 1>to compete.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was pretty shocking,</v>

2681
02:00:10.470 --> 02:00:12.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were certain number,</v>

2682
02:00:12.190 --> 02:00:14.380
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what that number and what </v>
<v Speaker 1>are they worried about?</v>

2683
02:00:14.410 --> 02:00:15.880
<v Speaker 1>They're worried about his opponent or </v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

2684
02:00:15.910 --> 02:00:16.910
<v Speaker 1>It's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it?</v>

2685
02:00:16.960 --> 02:00:17.860
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

2686
02:00:17.920 --> 02:00:20.590
<v Speaker 1>is this ignorance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was the guy in Pennsylvania,</v>

2687
02:00:20.860 --> 02:00:23.260
<v Speaker 1>was he just ignorant to testosterone </v>
<v Speaker 1>replacement?</v>

2688
02:00:23.261 --> 02:00:26.230
<v Speaker 1>Did he not understand that there was no </v>
<v Speaker 1>nate to mark?</v>

2689
02:00:26.260 --> 02:00:27.310
<v Speaker 1>Mark Doers?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2690
02:00:27.311 --> 02:00:31.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm a worry about Mark Hartz health or </v>
<v Speaker 1>was he right?</v>

2691
02:00:31.140 --> 02:00:31.870
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2692
02:00:31.871 --> 02:00:34.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a doctor obviously who.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the number was and.</v>

2693
02:00:34.930 --> 02:00:39.930
<v Speaker 1>But I do know that the guy literally </v>
<v Speaker 1>said this is dangerous because a </v>

2694
02:00:39.930 --> 02:00:42.580
<v Speaker 1>dangerous line,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately since I don't know the 50s</v>

2695
02:00:42.581 --> 02:00:45.580
<v Speaker 1>or 60s,</v>
<v Speaker 1>steroids have been involved with,</v>

2696
02:00:45.610 --> 02:00:49.030
<v Speaker 1>with sports and the higher the level of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the more stakes there are,</v>

2697
02:00:49.031 --> 02:00:51.310
<v Speaker 1>the more chances you're going to see </v>
<v Speaker 1>this abuse.</v>

2698
02:00:51.400 --> 02:00:52.600
<v Speaker 1>So in a perfect world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2699
02:00:52.601 --> 02:00:55.330
<v Speaker 1>I think I should be able to take it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's going to be honest.</v>

2700
02:00:55.331 --> 02:01:00.331
<v Speaker 1>You're not gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not gonna go over all that stuff </v>

2701
02:01:00.331 --> 02:01:00.331
<v Speaker 1>and voice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That just doesn't happen.</v>

2702
02:01:00.331 --> 02:01:03.960
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that guy should be able to </v>

2703
02:01:03.960 --> 02:01:04.900
<v Speaker 1>take it just because everybody should be</v>
<v Speaker 1>able to recover at a in a sort of like a</v>

2704
02:01:04.901 --> 02:01:09.090
<v Speaker 1>seemingly healthy normal way and some </v>
<v Speaker 1>people are just,</v>

2705
02:01:09.280 --> 02:01:14.280
<v Speaker 1>they have some sort of a natural </v>
<v Speaker 1>impediment and they should be able to </v>

2706
02:01:14.280 --> 02:01:14.280
<v Speaker 1>overcome that natural impediment with </v>
<v Speaker 1>science?</v>

2707
02:01:14.890 --> 02:01:18.160
<v Speaker 1>That's the argument I guess so because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't make you better.</v>

2708
02:01:18.161 --> 02:01:21.340
<v Speaker 1>What makes you better as hard work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it allows you to work harder because</v>

2709
02:01:21.341 --> 02:01:23.470
<v Speaker 1>it allows you to recover better in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>

2710
02:01:23.471 --> 02:01:26.380
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't near squeezy pants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't allow you to work harder because</v>

2711
02:01:26.381 --> 02:01:28.810
<v Speaker 1>it was recover.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where do you draw that line?</v>

2712
02:01:28.811 --> 02:01:33.811
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and unfortunately it's become such a </v>

2713
02:01:33.811 --> 02:01:35.851
<v Speaker 1>taboo topic right now that in reality </v>
<v Speaker 1>drugs are going to be part of every </v>

2714
02:01:38.591 --> 02:01:43.591
<v Speaker 1>sport from 40 years ago to is our </v>
<v Speaker 1>grandchildren's as far as we go into the</v>

2715
02:01:44.841 --> 02:01:46.100
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to happen.</v>

2716
02:01:46.130 --> 02:01:46.430
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2717
02:01:46.580 --> 02:01:49.610
<v Speaker 2>Why do people take vitamin supplements?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do people take minerals?</v>

2718
02:01:49.611 --> 02:01:51.800
<v Speaker 2>Why do people take glutamine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>glutamine,</v>

2719
02:01:51.801 --> 02:01:53.410
<v Speaker 2>why do people take creatine?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2720
02:01:53.420 --> 02:01:58.420
<v Speaker 2>they take all these legal supplements </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they give you a slight edge on </v>

2721
02:01:58.420 --> 02:02:02.231
<v Speaker 2>all of them together synergistically and</v>
<v Speaker 2>combine that edge and it gives you a </v>

2722
02:02:02.231 --> 02:02:03.440
<v Speaker 2>little gap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That little gap.</v>

2723
02:02:03.470 --> 02:02:04.670
<v Speaker 2>We've experienced it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2724
02:02:04.671 --> 02:02:09.671
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's stuff that we sell it on it </v>

2725
02:02:09.671 --> 02:02:10.340
<v Speaker 2>that's fucking a hundred percent legal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we'll give you a boost that,</v>

2726

<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2727
02:02:11.060 --> 02:02:14.390

<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's quite some mushrooms and </v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] and we know that [inaudible]</v>

2734
02:02:30.350 --> 02:02:32.090
<v Speaker 2>gives people a boost of energy.</v>

2735
02:02:32.090 --> 02:02:37.090
<v Speaker 2>We know that people have been doing b,</v>
<v Speaker 2>12 injections before wrestling matches </v>

2736
02:02:37.090 --> 02:02:38.480
<v Speaker 2>and all sorts of competitions for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>longest time.</v>

2737
02:02:38.481 --> 02:02:40.310
<v Speaker 2>Completely legal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We booked.</v>

2738
02:02:40.311 --> 02:02:42.800
<v Speaker 2>They do because it's effective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It should that be illegal.</v>

2739
02:02:43.740 --> 02:02:45.440
<v Speaker 2>Where do you draw the line?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where do you draw the line?</v>

2740
02:02:45.441 --> 02:02:47.600
<v Speaker 2>If you cannot be [inaudible] can you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have a b,</v>

2741
02:02:47.601 --> 02:02:48.190
<v Speaker 2>12?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2742
02:02:48.191 --> 02:02:48.800
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>12.</v>

2743
02:02:49.130 --> 02:02:51.830
<v Speaker 2>Can I take a multivitamin or what the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck?</v>

2744
02:02:52.610 --> 02:02:53.910
<v Speaker 2>What are we doing here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what?</v>

2745
02:02:54.290 --> 02:02:59.290
<v Speaker 2>Where is the line?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think the line's always moving at </v>

2746
02:02:59.290 --> 02:03:02.561
<v Speaker 2>one point in time they allow the </v>
<v Speaker 2>testosterone and now after veto or </v>

2747
02:03:02.561 --> 02:03:05.910
<v Speaker 2>tested at 1,475.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2748
02:03:06.560 --> 02:03:07.460
<v Speaker 2>that's on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like,</v>

2749
02:03:07.461 --> 02:03:09.170
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not even a person.</v>

2750
02:03:09.470 --> 02:03:10.610
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's some new thing.</v>

2751
02:03:10.810 --> 02:03:15.810
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to feel that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like just raging with that crazy </v>

2752
02:03:17.171 --> 02:03:22.171
<v Speaker 1>hair cut off is at 1,475.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just pop out of the bed in the morning </v>

2753
02:03:22.171 --> 02:03:25.690
<v Speaker 1>and in dance you do some prayers and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then just start fucking running hills.</v>

2754
02:03:25.691 --> 02:03:26.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would love that.</v>

2755
02:03:26.890 --> 02:03:27.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>

2756
02:03:28.360 --> 02:03:32.980
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if there was no </v>
<v Speaker 1>repercussions to that for sure.</v>

2757
02:03:32.981 --> 02:03:35.190
<v Speaker 1>I mean I want to feel that there must be</v>
<v Speaker 1>repercussions.</v>

2758
02:03:35.300 --> 02:03:35.910
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2759
02:03:36.250 --> 02:03:38.200
<v Speaker 1>That's the other thing too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is I tell guys all the time,</v>

2760
02:03:38.530 --> 02:03:40.870
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to start messing around </v>
<v Speaker 1>with your endocrine system,</v>

2761
02:03:41.410 --> 02:03:46.410
<v Speaker 1>go talk to an expert.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't take this stuff that Tony at the </v>

2762
02:03:46.410 --> 02:03:47.920
<v Speaker 1>Jim gave you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go really go find someone who knows,</v>

2763
02:03:47.950 --> 02:03:49.780
<v Speaker 1>says get blood tests,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get regular work to.</v>

2764
02:03:49.781 --> 02:03:52.120
<v Speaker 1>Of course that falls on deaf ears most </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the time.</v>

2765
02:03:53.410 --> 02:03:58.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it does fall and there's a reality also </v>

2766
02:03:58.410 --> 02:04:00.280
<v Speaker 1>that you can only get so big naturally.</v>

2767
02:04:00.670 --> 02:04:03.130
<v Speaker 1>Like when you see a guy who's gained 40 </v>
<v Speaker 1>pounds in a year,</v>

2768
02:04:03.430 --> 02:04:08.430
<v Speaker 1>your eyebrows should go look at the size</v>
<v Speaker 1>of like a defensive line of an NFL team </v>

2769
02:04:08.531 --> 02:04:12.790
<v Speaker 1>in 1975 and look what they weigh now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what do you think about,</v>

2770
02:04:13.090 --> 02:04:16.150
<v Speaker 1>do you think that some of them is just </v>
<v Speaker 1>genetic engineering?</v>

2771
02:04:16.370 --> 02:04:21.370
<v Speaker 1>You know like now I mean in the sense </v>
<v Speaker 1>that like big guys have chosen big women</v>

2772
02:04:21.670 --> 02:04:26.670
<v Speaker 1>and have fucked and made babies that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people are bigger now than they've ever </v>

2773
02:04:26.670 --> 02:04:27.550
<v Speaker 1>been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shoe sizes are bigger now than they were</v>

2774
02:04:27.551 --> 02:04:32.551
<v Speaker 1>20 years ago and also hormones in food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they really do believe that that is </v>

2775
02:04:32.651 --> 02:04:35.830
<v Speaker 1>having an impact of caloric intake as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

2776
02:04:35.831 --> 02:04:38.640
<v Speaker 1>So if you're eating tons calories at a </v>
<v Speaker 1>young age,</v>

2777
02:04:39.150 --> 02:04:41.740
<v Speaker 1>you know your body's going to go into </v>
<v Speaker 1>puberty quicker and then you just,</v>

2778
02:04:41.800 --> 02:04:43.830
<v Speaker 1>you secrete more growth hormone and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>get bigger.</v>

2779
02:04:44.160 --> 02:04:49.160
<v Speaker 1>So that's why the average foot size over</v>
<v Speaker 1>the past 20 years is bigger than it was </v>

2780
02:04:49.160 --> 02:04:50.880
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that plays a factor in,</v>

2781
02:04:51.060 --> 02:04:53.280
<v Speaker 1>but now the NFL is going to test for </v>
<v Speaker 1>growth hormone.</v>

2782
02:04:53.281 --> 02:04:56.940
<v Speaker 1>That's supposedly they're going to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know a guy who supplied a bunch of nfl</v>

2783
02:04:56.941 --> 02:04:58.740
<v Speaker 1>players with stuff and he just basically</v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

2784
02:04:58.741 --> 02:05:01.050
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody is like you can't do.</v>

2785
02:05:01.320 --> 02:05:06.320
<v Speaker 1>You can't have a 330 pound guy running </v>
<v Speaker 1>into you and be able to get recovered </v>

2786
02:05:07.201 --> 02:05:09.030
<v Speaker 1>again for next week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just can't do it.</v>

2787
02:05:09.540 --> 02:05:11.340
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we want to see that the Olympics,</v>

2788
02:05:11.341 --> 02:05:13.620
<v Speaker 1>I want to see Olympic records being </v>
<v Speaker 1>shattered.</v>

2789
02:05:13.680 --> 02:05:15.210
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get to a point,</v>

2790
02:05:15.650 --> 02:05:18.000
<v Speaker 1>if I'm watching a hundred meter sprint,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you really can't.</v>

2791
02:05:18.030 --> 02:05:23.030
<v Speaker 1>There's a physiological limit that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get to that when drugs </v>

2792
02:05:23.030 --> 02:05:27.471
<v Speaker 1>will help push it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this fence we don't like to talk </v>

2793
02:05:27.471 --> 02:05:27.471
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you all want to see it.</v>

2794
02:05:27.471 --> 02:05:30.800
<v Speaker 1>I want to see home runs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I watch a baseball game while I have </v>

2795
02:05:30.800 --> 02:05:32.310
<v Speaker 1>this ridiculous idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once I thought I was like,</v>

2796
02:05:32.311 --> 02:05:35.220
<v Speaker 1>how high can I jump?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can jump like,</v>

2797
02:05:35.390 --> 02:05:36.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this high,</v>

2798
02:05:36.240 --> 02:05:37.290
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2799
02:05:37.291 --> 02:05:40.230
<v Speaker 1>this one I'm going to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to take a pencil and I'm going</v>

2800
02:05:40.231 --> 02:05:45.231
<v Speaker 1>to jump up as high as I can and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to scratch the wall with his </v>

2801
02:05:45.231 --> 02:05:45.231
<v Speaker 1>pencil scratch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>scratcher post this pencil,</v>

2802
02:05:45.231 --> 02:05:48.350
<v Speaker 1>but I'm just going to do it every day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if I just keep jumping,</v>

2803
02:05:48.360 --> 02:05:50.040
<v Speaker 1>I'll get better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll get stronger.</v>

2804
02:05:50.070 --> 02:05:55.070
<v Speaker 1>If I keep jumping,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually I'll just jump out of the </v>

2805
02:05:55.070 --> 02:05:55.070
<v Speaker 1>fucking roof.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2806
02:05:55.070 --> 02:05:55.070
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is not.</v>

2807
02:05:55.070 --> 02:05:58.740
<v Speaker 1>There's a point of diminishing returns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there a point where you just,</v>

2808
02:05:58.770 --> 02:06:01.860
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to jump any higher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter how much you practice.</v>

2809
02:06:01.861 --> 02:06:02.970
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter how much you work out.</v>

2810
02:06:03.240 --> 02:06:08.240
<v Speaker 1>There's the the load limit on your knees</v>
<v Speaker 1>and your hips and your muscles and your </v>

2811
02:06:08.240 --> 02:06:08.240
<v Speaker 1>tendons and ligaments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2812
02:06:08.790 --> 02:06:09.090
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2813
02:06:09.091 --> 02:06:11.310
<v Speaker 1>I'd be jumping everyday for fucking 30 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

2814
02:06:11.630 --> 02:06:12.420
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>goddammit,</v>

2815
02:06:12.450 --> 02:06:15.030
<v Speaker 1>I can't clear this one mark that I made </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's just,</v>

2816
02:06:15.031 --> 02:06:16.170
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't work that way.</v>

2817
02:06:16.410 --> 02:06:18.890
<v Speaker 1>The body has limitations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then there's.</v>

2818
02:06:19.560 --> 02:06:20.920
<v Speaker 1>I guess the flip side is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2819
02:06:21.020 --> 02:06:22.800
<v Speaker 1>the format model is the greatest </v>
<v Speaker 1>example.</v>

2820
02:06:22.801 --> 02:06:27.801
<v Speaker 1>You know Roger Bannister,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one can break the four minute while </v>

2821
02:06:27.801 --> 02:06:29.350
<v Speaker 1>he does it and then like the next year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like 12 people do it in the next year,</v>

2822
02:06:29.710 --> 02:06:31.770
<v Speaker 1>25 people do it now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's high school kids.</v>

2823
02:06:31.771 --> 02:06:36.080
<v Speaker 1>He'll run under that power of belief </v>
<v Speaker 1>plays.</v>

2824
02:06:36.160 --> 02:06:38.250
<v Speaker 1>Is that counterbalance to this whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>argument?</v>

2825
02:06:38.270 --> 02:06:43.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do you think the NFL even wants </v>

2826
02:06:43.270 --> 02:06:43.700
<v Speaker 1>people to be tested for human growth </v>
<v Speaker 1>hormone?</v>

2827
02:06:43.760 --> 02:06:48.760
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't know who the fuck is </v>

2828
02:06:48.760 --> 02:06:48.760
<v Speaker 1>pressuring them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Society.</v>

2829
02:06:48.760 --> 02:06:48.780
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why they should go.</v>

2830
02:06:48.780 --> 02:06:53.780
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A few games on Sunday today click hang </v>

2831
02:06:53.780 --> 02:06:54.750
<v Speaker 1>up the phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who says that to say that we're going to</v>

2832
02:06:54.751 --> 02:06:59.751
<v Speaker 1>test and then they actually follow </v>
<v Speaker 1>through and tests are two different </v>

2833
02:06:59.751 --> 02:07:02.691
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to test everyone because if </v>

2834
02:07:02.691 --> 02:07:05.271
<v Speaker 1>I say Joe on Thursday or income test,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you went meaning today's Monday,</v>

2835
02:07:07.111 --> 02:07:12.111
<v Speaker 1>so you do your last shot and midnight on</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wednesday night and then you're good to </v>

2836
02:07:12.111 --> 02:07:15.030
<v Speaker 1>go because really the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if you fail it,</v>

2837
02:07:15.031 --> 02:07:18.270
<v Speaker 1>I've always said this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you feel a drug test in mma means you're</v>

2838
02:07:18.271 --> 02:07:21.000
<v Speaker 1>an idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well not anymore.</v>

2839
02:07:21.510 --> 02:07:25.920
<v Speaker 1>Now they're doing this like really </v>
<v Speaker 1>strict protocol that's like $40,000</v>

2840
02:07:25.921 --> 02:07:28.530
<v Speaker 1>a test in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how chill got popped.</v>

2841
02:07:28.531 --> 02:07:31.140
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're testing for EPO and human growth</v>

2842
02:07:31.141 --> 02:07:35.320
<v Speaker 1>hormone is always around that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean really the guys you do?</v>

2843
02:07:35.330 --> 02:07:36.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>

2844
02:07:36.130 --> 02:07:41.130
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen these new tasks?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll spot human growth hormone three </v>

2845
02:07:41.130 --> 02:07:41.130
<v Speaker 1>weeks out.</v>

2846
02:07:41.130 --> 02:07:43.170
<v Speaker 1>New tasks apparently stopped taking it </v>
<v Speaker 1>three and a half way,</v>

2847
02:07:43.220 --> 02:07:48.220
<v Speaker 1>but whatever the numbers are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have athletes who will </v>

2848
02:07:48.220 --> 02:07:49.360
<v Speaker 1>always find a way to get around things </v>
<v Speaker 1>into cheat.</v>

2849
02:07:49.420 --> 02:07:54.420
<v Speaker 1>It's always going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's always happened in the the WHO's </v>

2850
02:07:54.420 --> 02:07:57.811
<v Speaker 1>ever doing the drugs she's ever supply </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're always one step ahead with </v>

2851
02:07:57.811 --> 02:08:00.961
<v Speaker 1>the testers would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If a guy had to have a camera set up </v>

2852
02:08:01.150 --> 02:08:05.830
<v Speaker 1>like on a Webcam and everyday he has to </v>
<v Speaker 1>take us of a finger prick.</v>

2853
02:08:06.100 --> 02:08:09.460
<v Speaker 1>Like you have a home sensor machine and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you see people do it.</v>

2854
02:08:09.461 --> 02:08:11.890
<v Speaker 1>You take your fingerprint,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you put it on.</v>

2855
02:08:11.891 --> 02:08:16.891
<v Speaker 1>Like this home sensor machine sensor </v>
<v Speaker 1>recognizes your fingerprint that's </v>

2856
02:08:16.891 --> 02:08:21.141
<v Speaker 1>giving this blood sample.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It analyzes a sample without any input </v>

2857
02:08:21.141 --> 02:08:25.681
<v Speaker 1>from you whatsoever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and their results immediately go to a </v>

2858
02:08:25.681 --> 02:08:25.681
<v Speaker 1>lab.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have to do it every day.</v>

2859
02:08:25.681 --> 02:08:25.990
<v Speaker 1>If you're competing now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that'd be great.</v>

2860
02:08:26.610 --> 02:08:29.670
<v Speaker 1>To fake finger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone fell,</v>

2861
02:08:29.680 --> 02:08:30.280
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2862
02:08:30.340 --> 02:08:35.340
<v Speaker 1>They'll figure out a way to fucking have</v>
<v Speaker 1>a big dick sat there that you can put </v>

2863
02:08:35.471 --> 02:08:37.870
<v Speaker 1>someone else's urine and some will come </v>
<v Speaker 1>up with a fake fingerprint.</v>

2864
02:08:37.900 --> 02:08:40.780
<v Speaker 1>Didn't randleman do that then use the </v>
<v Speaker 1>flight deck.</v>

2865
02:08:41.320 --> 02:08:46.320
<v Speaker 1>Was it him or was it someone did tom </v>
<v Speaker 1>sizemore got busted using the fake Dick </v>

2866
02:08:46.320 --> 02:08:50.760
<v Speaker 1>who was trying to escape from some sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a DNA check that in your luggage and </v>

2867
02:08:50.910 --> 02:08:54.130
<v Speaker 1>your pants all the time and you just </v>
<v Speaker 1>hope they don't check.</v>

2868
02:08:54.640 --> 02:08:59.640
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine if someone that's not even a </v>

2869
02:08:59.640 --> 02:08:59.640
<v Speaker 1>real deck and start yanking on your desk</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2870
02:08:59.640 --> 02:08:59.640
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is isn't real.</v>

2871
02:08:59.640 --> 02:09:01.840
<v Speaker 1>Dick Tsa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2872
02:09:02.150 --> 02:09:03.160
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah they do have.</v>

2873
02:09:03.161 --> 02:09:05.790
<v Speaker 1>They have rubber ducks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nuts.</v>

2874
02:09:05.920 --> 02:09:07.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>

2875
02:09:07.710 --> 02:09:09.850
<v Speaker 1>I liked the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like the testing.</v>

2876
02:09:09.910 --> 02:09:14.910
<v Speaker 1>I think that's good particularly because</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have athletes that don't use any </v>

2877
02:09:14.910 --> 02:09:18.181
<v Speaker 1>drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I prefer to keep everything as clean </v>

2878
02:09:18.181 --> 02:09:18.181
<v Speaker 1>as possible.</v>

2879
02:09:18.181 --> 02:09:19.420
<v Speaker 1>But did you get bummed out when they </v>
<v Speaker 1>pulled the testosterone replacement?</v>

2880
02:09:19.421 --> 02:09:22.980
<v Speaker 1>Because if you were a guy like say you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't handle them anymore,</v>

2881
02:09:22.990 --> 02:09:27.160
<v Speaker 1>but if you were handling dance career </v>
<v Speaker 1>and all of a sudden and Dan,</v>

2882
02:09:27.161 --> 02:09:29.110
<v Speaker 1>the guy who did it ethically and was </v>
<v Speaker 1>taking,</v>

2883
02:09:29.200 --> 02:09:31.540
<v Speaker 1>you know exactly what he should be </v>
<v Speaker 1>taking,</v>

2884
02:09:31.550 --> 02:09:36.550
<v Speaker 1>do it all by the rules and then they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they pull it because one guy or a few </v>

2885
02:09:36.550 --> 02:09:40.390
<v Speaker 1>guys or whatever was abusing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a challenge for sure.</v>

2886
02:09:41.340 --> 02:09:42.670
<v Speaker 1>You just have to find a way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2887
02:09:42.671 --> 02:09:44.650
<v Speaker 1>You have to adjust training.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to go back and go,</v>

2888
02:09:44.651 --> 02:09:45.890
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now we need to.</v>

2889
02:09:45.910 --> 02:09:47.910
<v Speaker 1>We have to rethink what we're doing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>how we're doing.</v>

2890
02:09:47.980 --> 02:09:50.620
<v Speaker 1>So we have to pull back on the training.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to do less.</v>

2891
02:09:51.070 --> 02:09:54.160
<v Speaker 1>Maybe shorter intensity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we.</v>

2892
02:09:54.190 --> 02:09:56.560
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the camp instead of eight weeks is</v>
<v Speaker 1>six weeks.</v>

2893
02:09:56.620 --> 02:10:00.010
<v Speaker 1>He just changes change the strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what about is there any,</v>

2894
02:10:00.630 --> 02:10:03.160
<v Speaker 1>any shortcuts to recovery other than </v>
<v Speaker 1>those pants?</v>

2895
02:10:03.161 --> 02:10:06.280
<v Speaker 1>The squeezy things?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there anything else and rest.</v>

2896
02:10:06.281 --> 02:10:08.020
<v Speaker 1>And then the biggest thing is staying in</v>
<v Speaker 1>shape.</v>

2897
02:10:08.720 --> 02:10:11.710
<v Speaker 1>The one thing that randy did better than</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he was always in shape,</v>

2898
02:10:12.880 --> 02:10:16.420
<v Speaker 1>so whatever else never injured that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>

2899
02:10:16.440 --> 02:10:18.520
<v Speaker 1>Do you know Peter Graham?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a kickboxer.</v>

2900
02:10:18.540 --> 02:10:20.110
<v Speaker 1>Here comes another one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's 30,</v>

2901
02:10:20.111 --> 02:10:25.111
<v Speaker 1>probably 37.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's been competing at a high level for </v>

2902
02:10:25.111 --> 02:10:29.041
<v Speaker 1>20 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's never had an injury that's causing </v>

2903
02:10:29.041 --> 02:10:29.041
<v Speaker 1>him to miss training or fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's incredible.</v>

2904
02:10:29.041 --> 02:10:31.390
<v Speaker 1>When you look at athletes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most people,</v>

2905
02:10:31.391 --> 02:10:32.080
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we go back to,</v>

2906
02:10:32.081 --> 02:10:33.890
<v Speaker 1>is there ever going to be enough talent?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2907
02:10:33.891 --> 02:10:38.891
<v Speaker 1>most people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their bodies can't handle the stress of </v>

2908
02:10:38.891 --> 02:10:38.891
<v Speaker 1>training.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't.</v>

2909
02:10:38.891 --> 02:10:43.481
<v Speaker 1>My neck went at 21 or 22 herniated disc </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then all of a sudden things are done</v>

2910
02:10:44.390 --> 02:10:49.390
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you have to have a particular joint </v>

2911
02:10:49.390 --> 02:10:49.670
<v Speaker 1>structure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bone structure,</v>

2912
02:10:49.671 --> 02:10:54.671
<v Speaker 1>musculature that your body can withstand</v>
<v Speaker 1>years of pounding and pounding and </v>

2913
02:10:54.671 --> 02:10:54.671
<v Speaker 1>pounding.</v>

2914
02:10:54.671 --> 02:10:57.290
<v Speaker 1>That's one thing they mentally have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be able to stay in the game.</v>

2915
02:10:57.590 --> 02:10:59.630
<v Speaker 1>If you get rich and famous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you handle that?</v>

2916
02:10:59.631 --> 02:11:01.290
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that rules that most people are there,</v>

2917
02:11:01.291 --> 02:11:06.291
<v Speaker 1>you're going to go off the rails anyways</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you can surround yourself with </v>

2918
02:11:06.291 --> 02:11:09.851
<v Speaker 1>the right people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All these certain things have to happen </v>

2919
02:11:09.851 --> 02:11:12.940
<v Speaker 1>for you to achieve this level of success</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's very difficult that those </v>

2920
02:11:12.940 --> 02:11:16.631
<v Speaker 1>come through and within mma may,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the lowest barrier for entry than </v>

2921
02:11:16.631 --> 02:11:20.051
<v Speaker 1>any professional sport.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could take a guy off the street and </v>

2922
02:11:20.051 --> 02:11:20.051
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you want to be a pro MMA fighter?</v>

2923
02:11:20.051 --> 02:11:21.360
<v Speaker 1>You could go to a local promoter in </v>
<v Speaker 1>sale,</v>

2924
02:11:21.361 --> 02:11:23.390
<v Speaker 1>sell 40 tickets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he'll get you a fight.</v>

2925
02:11:24.250 --> 02:11:26.690
<v Speaker 1>That does happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It happens all the time.</v>

2926
02:11:27.180 --> 02:11:32.180
<v Speaker 1>Especially in those old school like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Indian casino fights these to have in </v>

2927
02:11:32.180 --> 02:11:35.270
<v Speaker 1>California when there was no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they still go on.</v>

2928
02:11:35.390 --> 02:11:36.050
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2929
02:11:36.051 --> 02:11:37.340
<v Speaker 1>In California,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they still go on.</v>

2930
02:11:37.410 --> 02:11:39.290
<v Speaker 1>Even though it's sanctioned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sanctioned,</v>

2931
02:11:39.291 --> 02:11:44.291
<v Speaker 1>they still do these sort of off brand </v>
<v Speaker 1>promotions where they have these guys </v>

2932
02:11:44.421 --> 02:11:46.910
<v Speaker 1>that are just fucking completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>inexperienced,</v>

2933
02:11:46.911 --> 02:11:50.030
<v Speaker 1>have no business being there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the barrier for entry is very low,</v>

2934
02:11:50.330 --> 02:11:55.330
<v Speaker 1>but really finding quality people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quality athletes so you can because you </v>

2935
02:11:55.330 --> 02:11:56.960
<v Speaker 1>have to invest in people to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It costs money to do this.</v>

2936
02:11:57.290 --> 02:11:58.430
<v Speaker 1>That's the one thing we didn't talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

2937
02:11:58.431 --> 02:11:59.870
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to have someone go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2938
02:12:00.110 --> 02:12:01.040
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of your,</v>

2939
02:12:01.100 --> 02:12:06.100
<v Speaker 1>all of your transactions are going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>private training sessions so you get </v>

2940
02:12:06.100 --> 02:12:06.950
<v Speaker 1>exactly what you need for that day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't come cheap either,</v>

2941
02:12:07.250 --> 02:12:09.230
<v Speaker 1>so you have to really make investments </v>
<v Speaker 1>in people.</v>

2942
02:12:09.231 --> 02:12:14.231
<v Speaker 1>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone will come along that really </v>

2943
02:12:14.231 --> 02:12:15.551
<v Speaker 1>wants to start investing in developing </v>
<v Speaker 1>athletes and then brands will start </v>

2944
02:12:16.131 --> 02:12:20.190
<v Speaker 1>linking up to that because right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even with the sponsors,</v>

2945
02:12:20.191 --> 02:12:21.680
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things no one really knows.</v>

2946
02:12:21.680 --> 02:12:24.230
<v Speaker 1>Don't really wants to touch an MMA </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighter so much.</v>

2947
02:12:24.740 --> 02:12:29.740
<v Speaker 1>But if you look at value for the money </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the value and the exposure that </v>

2948
02:12:29.740 --> 02:12:30.530
<v Speaker 1>these kids get in and the platform that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the UFC is created,</v>

2949
02:12:30.760 --> 02:12:35.760
<v Speaker 1>there's a ton of value here that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that most brands are not taking </v>

2950
02:12:35.760 --> 02:12:39.491
<v Speaker 1>advantage of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's also issues like Nike was </v>

2951
02:12:39.491 --> 02:12:42.071
<v Speaker 1>sponsoring Jones and then Jones had that</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy bra with cormier and then they </v>

2952
02:12:42.071 --> 02:12:46.070
<v Speaker 1>pull the sponsorship loss on his side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2953
02:12:46.071 --> 02:12:48.380
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how much they were paying </v>
<v Speaker 1>them how to be six figures.</v>

2954
02:12:48.740 --> 02:12:50.570
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's a.</v>

2955
02:12:50.630 --> 02:12:55.630
<v Speaker 1>it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a big cache to be sponsored by </v>

2956
02:12:55.630 --> 02:12:56.060
<v Speaker 1>Nike,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2957
02:12:56.061 --> 02:12:57.030
<v Speaker 1>one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2958
02:12:57.050 --> 02:13:02.050
<v Speaker 1>whatever fortune 500 companies that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>even considering maybe getting a raise </v>

2959
02:13:02.050 --> 02:13:05.891
<v Speaker 1>gay ready to fortune 500 company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They might be probably and they were </v>

2960
02:13:05.891 --> 02:13:09.311
<v Speaker 1>handling big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're promoting George Saint Pierre for </v>

2961
02:13:09.311 --> 02:13:11.890
<v Speaker 1>awhile or sponsoring him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like there's a couple of those </v>

2962
02:13:11.890 --> 02:13:16.241
<v Speaker 1>like really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think it was just the brawler </v>

2963
02:13:16.241 --> 02:13:16.970
<v Speaker 1>there other things as well because he </v>
<v Speaker 1>hasn't done a great job on social media.</v>

2964
02:13:17.080 --> 02:13:18.620
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So to me it's,</v>

2965
02:13:18.910 --> 02:13:21.680
<v Speaker 1>that's why you have to help someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand how they fit in,</v>

2966
02:13:21.681 --> 02:13:23.930
<v Speaker 1>how to craft this image.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at Saint Pierre.</v>

2967
02:13:23.960 --> 02:13:24.230
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

2968
02:13:24.231 --> 02:13:29.231
<v Speaker 1>how long has he been around for?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ever heard of one bit of dirt on George </v>

2969
02:13:29.231 --> 02:13:29.231
<v Speaker 1>Saint Pierre?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2970
02:13:29.231 --> 02:13:32.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing that can't be a debated.</v>

2971
02:13:32.270 --> 02:13:32.840
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2972
02:13:32.841 --> 02:13:34.920
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the issues with his former manager,</v>

2973
02:13:34.921 --> 02:13:39.921
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a big lawsuit that was going on </v>

2974
02:13:39.921 --> 02:13:42.040
<v Speaker 2>where he'd left his former manager,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I been around as far former manager </v>

2975
02:13:42.040 --> 02:13:42.720
<v Speaker 2>and his former manager's husband and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there was just,</v>

2976
02:13:43.060 --> 02:13:44.550
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of weirdness going on </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

2977
02:13:44.551 --> 02:13:49.551
<v Speaker 2>That was the good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy that used to call the witch </v>

2978
02:13:49.551 --> 02:13:51.060
<v Speaker 2>doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember that he was rubbing on </v>

2979
02:13:51.060 --> 02:13:52.080
<v Speaker 2>people's chests and aligning their </v>
<v Speaker 2>shockers and all our ah,</v>

2980
02:13:52.140 --> 02:13:57.140
<v Speaker 2>what but for said a career like he has.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You haven't seen any weird media things.</v>

2981
02:13:57.241 --> 02:13:59.220
<v Speaker 2>Great Guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a legitimately great guy.</v>

2982
02:13:59.260 --> 02:13:59.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2983
02:13:59.791 --> 02:14:01.650
<v Speaker 2>John is a wild motherfucker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2984
02:14:01.651 --> 02:14:06.651
<v Speaker 2>and as much as he would like to contain </v>
<v Speaker 2>it and have everybody think that he's </v>

2985
02:14:06.651 --> 02:14:10.790
<v Speaker 2>like Super Uber Professional,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the reasons why he's so fucking </v>

2986
02:14:10.790 --> 02:14:14.961
<v Speaker 2>good is because he's so wild.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why he's willing to throw </v>

2987
02:14:14.961 --> 02:14:16.110
<v Speaker 2>spinning elbows in there and do all </v>
<v Speaker 2>kinds of wild,</v>

2988
02:14:16.111 --> 02:14:21.111
<v Speaker 2>crazy shit and hit a jumping flying knee</v>
<v Speaker 2>on show gun two seconds into their fight</v>

2989
02:14:21.571 --> 02:14:22.320
<v Speaker 2>for the title.</v>

2990
02:14:22.520 --> 02:14:27.520
<v Speaker 2>Know he's a wild dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the kind of guy that becomes </v>

2991
02:14:27.520 --> 02:14:27.520
<v Speaker 2>a champion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2992
02:14:27.520 --> 02:14:29.400
<v Speaker 2>that's just the way it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A fine line there.</v>

2993
02:14:29.430 --> 02:14:30.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2994
02:14:30.291 --> 02:14:35.291
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And sometimes you drive drunk and a </v>

2995
02:14:35.291 --> 02:14:35.291
<v Speaker 2>Bentley with a bunch of strippers in </v>
<v Speaker 2>your lap.</v>

2996
02:14:35.291 --> 02:14:37.350
<v Speaker 2>There's just those kinds of guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

2997
02:14:37.410 --> 02:14:38.850
<v Speaker 2>that's Jack Johnson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2998
02:14:38.851 --> 02:14:40.650
<v Speaker 2>that's fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a,</v>

2999
02:14:40.680 --> 02:14:45.680
<v Speaker 2>that's Jack Dempsey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the wild motherfuckers and while </v>

3000
02:14:45.680 --> 02:14:48.070
<v Speaker 2>that's Mike Tyson in his prime wild </v>
<v Speaker 2>motherfuckers,</v>

3001
02:14:48.071 --> 02:14:51.060
<v Speaker 2>while motherfuckers make great fighters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

3002
02:14:51.061 --> 02:14:56.061
<v Speaker 2>if you're a big corporation looking to </v>
<v Speaker 2>keep a shiny image of smiling athletes </v>

3003
02:14:56.441 --> 02:14:58.320
<v Speaker 2>who have beautiful white teeth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might not,</v>

3004
02:14:58.560 --> 02:15:02.400
<v Speaker 2>might not want to be associated with </v>
<v Speaker 2>some dude who's going to start brawls at</v>

3005
02:15:02.401 --> 02:15:04.230
<v Speaker 2>a press conference,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3006
02:15:04.231 --> 02:15:09.231
<v Speaker 2>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the reality of corporations </v>

3007
02:15:09.231 --> 02:15:11.480
<v Speaker 2>looking to align themselves with cage </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighters.</v>

3008
02:15:11.481 --> 02:15:16.481
<v Speaker 2>It's a challenge in this sport and </v>
<v Speaker 2>hopefully that as a sport develops and </v>

3009
02:15:16.481 --> 02:15:20.871
<v Speaker 2>athletes get better at dealing with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>media and crafting ways to approach and </v>

3010
02:15:20.871 --> 02:15:22.200
<v Speaker 2>deal with that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then the more opportunities will come.</v>

3011
02:15:22.590 --> 02:15:23.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope so too.</v>

3012
02:15:23.930 --> 02:15:28.930
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's also people who are </v>

3013
02:15:28.930 --> 02:15:28.930
<v Speaker 2>concerned that Emma might have plateaued</v>
<v Speaker 2>as well.</v>

3014
02:15:28.930 --> 02:15:32.460
<v Speaker 2>They're concerned that like with the Fox</v>
<v Speaker 2>sports,</v>

3015
02:15:32.461 --> 02:15:37.461
<v Speaker 2>one deal with the UFC on Fox and the UFC</v>
<v Speaker 2>having so many cards.</v>

3016
02:15:37.740 --> 02:15:40.580
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's cars constantly and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a fight pass cards.</v>

3017
02:15:40.581 --> 02:15:45.581
<v Speaker 2>So there's international cards are </v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes two different cards going on </v>

3018
02:15:45.581 --> 02:15:48.711
<v Speaker 2>at the same night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There might be some sort of an </v>

3019
02:15:48.711 --> 02:15:49.440
<v Speaker 2>oversaturation issue or that it doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not special anymore where it's like</v>

3020
02:15:50.100 --> 02:15:52.980
<v Speaker 2>boxing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll have fights every now and again,</v>

3021
02:15:52.981 --> 02:15:55.520
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a million different promoters,</v>

3022
02:15:55.630 --> 02:15:57.560
<v Speaker 2>Paul Barrons promoting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3023
02:15:57.620 --> 02:16:02.620
<v Speaker 2>the golden boys promoting is a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 2>different promotions that are going on </v>

3024
02:16:02.620 --> 02:16:05.960
<v Speaker 2>in every x amount of months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a big fight every x amount of </v>

3025
02:16:05.960 --> 02:16:06.920
<v Speaker 2>months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Floyd mayweather fight.</v>

3026
02:16:07.040 --> 02:16:09.540
<v Speaker 2>Miguel cotto,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know Amir Khan,</v>

3027
02:16:09.541 --> 02:16:14.541
<v Speaker 2>like someone who has a big name and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that'll be like a headliner marquee </v>

3028
02:16:14.541 --> 02:16:18.681
<v Speaker 2>fights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They suffer the same weakness that MMA </v>

3029
02:16:18.681 --> 02:16:21.180
<v Speaker 2>does and that forever it will be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will be talent.</v>

3030
02:16:21.360 --> 02:16:26.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you could have the greatest </v>

3031
02:16:26.360 --> 02:16:28.211
<v Speaker 2>distribution and all this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you don't have a talented </v>

3032
02:16:28.211 --> 02:16:28.211
<v Speaker 2>marketable athlete coming up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have anything.</v>

3033
02:16:28.211 --> 02:16:28.920
<v Speaker 2>So that's why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To me,</v>

3034
02:16:29.230 --> 02:16:30.160
<v Speaker 2>development is the area</v>

3035
02:16:30.160 --> 02:16:32.790
<v Speaker 3>that's most neglected in this sport and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's.</v>

3036
02:16:32.990 --> 02:16:36.340
<v Speaker 3>It's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the foundation of the entire sport.</v>

3037
02:16:36.341 --> 02:16:38.140
<v Speaker 3>You have to have a guy who's gonna get </v>
<v Speaker 3>excited,</v>

3038
02:16:38.141 --> 02:16:39.760
<v Speaker 3>who's going to be exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to win fights.</v>

3039
02:16:39.780 --> 02:16:42.100
<v Speaker 3>Exciting ways is going to handle the </v>
<v Speaker 3>media well.</v>

3040
02:16:42.101 --> 02:16:44.120
<v Speaker 3>Who's going to sell pay per views?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

3041
02:16:44.290 --> 02:16:47.140
<v Speaker 3>that's everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sports psychology.</v>

3042
02:16:47.440 --> 02:16:48.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>

3043
02:16:48.250 --> 02:16:49.940
<v Speaker 3>you guys work with the sports </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychology?</v>

3044
02:16:49.990 --> 02:16:50.500
<v Speaker 3>We do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

3045
02:16:50.501 --> 02:16:55.501
<v Speaker 3>We work with a really good guy out of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>cal state fullerton and works with a </v>

3046
02:16:55.501 --> 02:16:57.280
<v Speaker 3>bunch of Olympic swimmers and he's been </v>
<v Speaker 3>fantastic.</v>

3047
02:16:57.490 --> 02:16:58.540
<v Speaker 3>And do you.</v>

3048
02:16:58.600 --> 02:17:02.830
<v Speaker 2>I have everybody work with this guy or </v>
<v Speaker 2>is it based on a need?</v>

3049
02:17:03.370 --> 02:17:06.130
<v Speaker 2>Is it a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it something that you have like.</v>

3050
02:17:06.131 --> 02:17:11.131
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you address it as part of this is this </v>

3051
02:17:11.131 --> 02:17:11.131
<v Speaker 2>is one aspect of who you are as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighter</v>

3052
02:17:11.131 --> 02:17:13.420
<v Speaker 3>mindset and we should maximize that </v>
<v Speaker 3>mindset.</v>

3053
02:17:13.480 --> 02:17:16.060
<v Speaker 3>To me it's an important part of </v>
<v Speaker 3>training.</v>

3054
02:17:16.390 --> 02:17:20.230
<v Speaker 3>I think everyone should work with </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone on that side of things like what</v>

3055
02:17:20.231 --> 02:17:25.231
<v Speaker 3>does this sport psychologists do really </v>
<v Speaker 3>helps them kind of frame what's going on</v>

3056
02:17:25.601 --> 02:17:30.601
<v Speaker 3>in their life in a positive way or to </v>
<v Speaker 3>help them deal with the pressure and </v>

3057
02:17:30.601 --> 02:17:31.090
<v Speaker 3>stress of competition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what do they do?</v>

3058
02:17:31.750 --> 02:17:35.140
<v Speaker 3>I've never sit in on those sessions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a sports psychologist,</v>

3059
02:17:35.141 --> 02:17:38.080
<v Speaker 3>but don't want to know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So personal.</v>

3060
02:17:38.081 --> 02:17:40.330
<v Speaker 3>It's not my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not my place to be there.</v>

3061
02:17:40.630 --> 02:17:41.560
<v Speaker 3>Whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

3062
02:17:41.890 --> 02:17:46.890
<v Speaker 3>I can't be there for everything and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>want them to have an outlet that they </v>

3063
02:17:46.890 --> 02:17:48.430
<v Speaker 3>can go to to talk about if there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>stress of pressure,</v>

3064
02:17:48.431 --> 02:17:51.010
<v Speaker 3>they're feeling this feeling like that </v>
<v Speaker 3>he's an expert in dealing with that.</v>

3065
02:17:51.011 --> 02:17:54.670
<v Speaker 3>I don't if they want to bring me in or </v>
<v Speaker 3>ask me a question that I'm happy to,</v>

3066
02:17:54.671 --> 02:17:56.200
<v Speaker 3>but no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to go sit in a session.</v>

3067
02:17:56.260 --> 02:17:56.750
<v Speaker 3>I've never seen</v>

3068
02:17:56.800 --> 02:17:59.860
<v Speaker 2>sat in with a sports psychologist or a </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychologist,</v>

3069
02:18:00.160 --> 02:18:04.540
<v Speaker 2>but I think if it can work with </v>
<v Speaker 2>professional athletes that have probably</v>

3070
02:18:04.541 --> 02:18:09.541
<v Speaker 2>worked with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought about doing it for standup </v>

3071
02:18:09.541 --> 02:18:09.541
<v Speaker 2>comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3072
02:18:09.541 --> 02:18:11.260
<v Speaker 2>Going with a sports psychologist to work</v>
<v Speaker 2>on standup comedy.</v>

3073
02:18:11.261 --> 02:18:16.261
<v Speaker 2>Like I wonder if there's something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because comics are all like lone wolves </v>

3074
02:18:16.261 --> 02:18:20.431
<v Speaker 2>all doing it on their own.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one ever brings in people to help </v>

3075
02:18:20.431 --> 02:18:23.221
<v Speaker 2>them with anything other than.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Occasionally comics will bring another </v>

3076
02:18:23.221 --> 02:18:24.040
<v Speaker 2>comics as writers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I wonder like mindset,</v>

3077
02:18:24.430 --> 02:18:26.950
<v Speaker 2>that performance mindset.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a very important,</v>

3078
02:18:27.040 --> 02:18:28.630
<v Speaker 2>whether it's athletics or</v>

3079
02:18:29.410 --> 02:18:31.610
<v Speaker 3>athletics as a father,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a husband.</v>

3080
02:18:31.611 --> 02:18:32.420
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whatever.</v>

3081
02:18:32.421 --> 02:18:33.140
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>

3082
02:18:33.560 --> 02:18:36.370
<v Speaker 3>But you haven't done it now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now with this guy,</v>

3083
02:18:36.371 --> 02:18:41.371
<v Speaker 3>let's say he actually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have talked with him on a couple of </v>

3084
02:18:41.371 --> 02:18:41.371
<v Speaker 3>occasions about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

3085
02:18:41.371 --> 02:18:42.350
<v Speaker 3>during the fight week,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here are some things that that you might</v>

3086
02:18:42.351 --> 02:18:44.660
<v Speaker 3>want to stay away from saying more </v>
<v Speaker 3>general stuff,</v>

3087
02:18:44.720 --> 02:18:47.930
<v Speaker 3>like what kind of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One thing he pointed out was that like,</v>

3088
02:18:47.931 --> 02:18:49.520
<v Speaker 3>it's a common thing to go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how you doing?</v>

3089
02:18:49.970 --> 02:18:52.460
<v Speaker 3>How you doing today?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't do that with a fighter.</v>

3090
02:18:53.270 --> 02:18:56.390
<v Speaker 3>You can occasionally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's kind of some built in things</v>

3091
02:18:56.391 --> 02:18:57.170
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How am I doing?</v>

3092
02:18:57.400 --> 02:19:01.280
<v Speaker 3>Why hadn't thought about it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well my my shoulder kind of hurts.</v>

3093
02:19:01.281 --> 02:19:04.160
<v Speaker 3>It's like all of a sudden you start </v>
<v Speaker 3>focusing off in that direction.</v>

3094
02:19:04.250 --> 02:19:06.670
<v Speaker 3>That gauge I told you about where we </v>
<v Speaker 3>have negative.</v>

3095
02:19:06.920 --> 02:19:10.380
<v Speaker 3>That was all from him also.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have it a close idea of negative.</v>

3096
02:19:10.390 --> 02:19:11.820
<v Speaker 3>I'll text it to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can post it if you want.</v>

3097
02:19:11.830 --> 02:19:12.740
<v Speaker 3>I'll text it to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3098
02:19:12.860 --> 02:19:14.390
<v Speaker 3>It's super helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's actually,</v>

3099
02:19:14.391 --> 02:19:17.930
<v Speaker 3>I think it's my.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's my screensaver gauge.</v>

3100
02:19:18.230 --> 02:19:19.250
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really helpful.</v>

3101
02:19:19.251 --> 02:19:21.350
<v Speaker 3>If you look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll do it when we're done.</v>

3102
02:19:23.100 --> 02:19:25.610
<v Speaker 3>Yes or anything and I found this in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Chiropractic to.</v>

3103
02:19:25.620 --> 02:19:27.680
<v Speaker 3>I learned this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I go back,</v>

3104
02:19:27.681 --> 02:19:32.681
<v Speaker 3>I walked onto.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wrestled my senior year in high </v>

3105
02:19:32.681 --> 02:19:35.141
<v Speaker 3>school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>separate my ac joints every half a year </v>

3106
02:19:35.141 --> 02:19:36.740
<v Speaker 3>in high school and then walked on to </v>
<v Speaker 3>Arizona state who at the time,</v>

3107
02:19:36.741 --> 02:19:39.740
<v Speaker 3>two years prior,</v>
<v Speaker 3>were the national champions of the team.</v>

3108
02:19:39.741 --> 02:19:42.970
<v Speaker 3>They took third the year before the son.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His kids were there,</v>

3109
02:19:42.980 --> 02:19:47.980
<v Speaker 3>so we're always Olympia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was as tough as a wrestling room </v>

3110
02:19:47.980 --> 02:19:48.980
<v Speaker 3>could get and I had half a year of high </v>
<v Speaker 3>school wrestling and I went in there and</v>

3111
02:19:48.981 --> 02:19:53.981
<v Speaker 3>got smashed for four months and then at </v>
<v Speaker 3>the end of four months I could kind of </v>

3112
02:19:53.981 --> 02:19:56.600
<v Speaker 3>keep up and survive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but my mindset the whole time wasn't,</v>

3113
02:19:56.630 --> 02:20:01.630
<v Speaker 3>I'm coming here and when my mindset was </v>
<v Speaker 3>I can hang with these guys and eight </v>

3114
02:20:01.630 --> 02:20:04.370
<v Speaker 3>months later I would have a four three </v>
<v Speaker 3>match with a returning all American,</v>

3115
02:20:05.030 --> 02:20:10.030
<v Speaker 3>but I never got a five for match and </v>
<v Speaker 3>beat him because the mindset wasn't </v>

3116
02:20:10.030 --> 02:20:10.040
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

3117
02:20:10.040 --> 02:20:12.050
<v Speaker 3>The mindset was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can hang with these guys.</v>

3118
02:20:12.530 --> 02:20:14.870
<v Speaker 3>You have to be able to create a mindset.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to go in there.</v>

3119
02:20:14.871 --> 02:20:17.120
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to dominate this guy in every </v>
<v Speaker 3>single way,</v>

3120
02:20:17.121 --> 02:20:22.121
<v Speaker 3>every second of this fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that is a whole different mindset </v>

3121
02:20:22.121 --> 02:20:23.450
<v Speaker 3>that you have to develop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fast forward to my chiropractic years,</v>

3122
02:20:23.451 --> 02:20:28.451
<v Speaker 3>I saw this happen all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw that people who had long standing </v>

3123
02:20:28.451 --> 02:20:32.711
<v Speaker 3>musculoskeletal injuries,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was always an emotional component </v>

3124
02:20:32.711 --> 02:20:35.711
<v Speaker 3>to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes it was 99% woman came to see </v>

3125
02:20:35.711 --> 02:20:36.870
<v Speaker 3>me and she was on some medication I'd </v>
<v Speaker 3>never heard of.</v>

3126
02:20:36.871 --> 02:20:37.140
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3127
02:20:37.141 --> 02:20:38.780
<v Speaker 3>what is this for?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she goes,</v>

3128
02:20:38.781 --> 02:20:39.590
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have.</v>

3129
02:20:39.620 --> 02:20:41.000
<v Speaker 3>I'm epileptic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have seizures.</v>

3130
02:20:41.030 --> 02:20:41.530
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3131
02:20:41.550 --> 02:20:42.740
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well tell me about them.</v>

3132
02:20:43.100 --> 02:20:48.100
<v Speaker 3>And I don't know why.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something just didn't feel right about </v>

3133
02:20:48.100 --> 02:20:48.100
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the more she talks,</v>

3134
02:20:48.100 --> 02:20:49.760
<v Speaker 3>the more questions I ask,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when did they happen?</v>

3135
02:20:49.790 --> 02:20:50.750
<v Speaker 3>She finally tells me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3136
02:20:50.751 --> 02:20:55.190
<v Speaker 3>they happen whenever I see a frog,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which for you and I living in California</v>

3137
02:20:55.191 --> 02:20:57.500
<v Speaker 3>is not that big of a deal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she lived in north Queensland,</v>

3138
02:20:57.501 --> 02:21:02.501
<v Speaker 3>Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She'd open her door and there'd be 10 </v>

3139
02:21:02.501 --> 02:21:02.580
<v Speaker 3>green tree frogs right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So somewhere along the line,</v>

3140
02:21:02.600 --> 02:21:07.600
<v Speaker 3>her brain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she had a fear of frogs that linked up </v>

3141
02:21:07.600 --> 02:21:09.270
<v Speaker 3>to this huge emotional response.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Green tree frogs poisonous or something.</v>

3142
02:21:10.060 --> 02:21:15.060
<v Speaker 3>They weren't just a green frog there and</v>
<v Speaker 3>her body would go into such a state that</v>

3143
02:21:15.681 --> 02:21:18.050
<v Speaker 3>she would have a seizure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Frogs a rock.</v>

3144
02:21:18.080 --> 02:21:20.990
<v Speaker 3>She had this frog phobe so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sounds crazy,</v>

3145
02:21:20.991 --> 02:21:23.360
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But this was her life if you think about</v>

3146
02:21:23.361 --> 02:21:25.940
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So she couldn't go to barbecues,</v>

3147
02:21:26.270 --> 02:21:28.310
<v Speaker 3>which was in that part of the country </v>
<v Speaker 3>was popular.</v>

3148
02:21:28.311 --> 02:21:30.620
<v Speaker 3>She couldn't go outside a whole lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She lives in the top.</v>

3149
02:21:30.621 --> 02:21:32.300
<v Speaker 3>I mean it affected her whole life.</v>

3150
02:21:32.840 --> 02:21:36.290
<v Speaker 3>So at the time I had started a reading </v>
<v Speaker 3>it when I,</v>

3151
02:21:36.291 --> 02:21:41.291
<v Speaker 3>when I figured out how much of an </v>
<v Speaker 3>emotional components is all these </v>

3152
02:21:41.291 --> 02:21:43.970
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] scene,</v>
<v Speaker 3>200 people a week and they come in with </v>

3153
02:21:43.970 --> 02:21:43.970
<v Speaker 3>back pain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had talked to him more and it's like,</v>

3154
02:21:43.970 --> 02:21:44.750
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's so much else going on.</v>

3155
02:21:44.751 --> 02:21:46.670
<v Speaker 3>It's not just your back pains,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the problem here,</v>

3156
02:21:46.940 --> 02:21:49.240
<v Speaker 3>it's the way that you're thinking and </v>
<v Speaker 3>processing information.</v>

3157
02:21:49.241 --> 02:21:50.990
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of the psychology aspect to </v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

3158
02:21:51.560 --> 02:21:54.680
<v Speaker 3>So I started reading about this guy </v>
<v Speaker 3>named Milton Erickson.</v>

3159
02:21:54.681 --> 02:21:56.930
<v Speaker 3>Milton Erickson was the founder of </v>
<v Speaker 3>modern hypnosis,</v>

3160
02:21:56.931 --> 02:22:01.931
<v Speaker 3>one of the most amazing people ever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he would do speeches with 3000 </v>

3161
02:22:01.931 --> 02:22:05.741
<v Speaker 3>people in hypnotize a whole room,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I always felt this connection with </v>

3162
02:22:05.741 --> 02:22:05.741
<v Speaker 3>Milton Erickson.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had the same birthday that I did.</v>

3163
02:22:05.741 --> 02:22:07.910
<v Speaker 3>He lived in Providence and Phoenix where</v>
<v Speaker 3>I lived,</v>

3164
02:22:07.911 --> 02:22:12.911
<v Speaker 3>and so there was these strategy books on</v>
<v Speaker 3>on how Milton Erickson would do this and</v>

3165
02:22:14.001 --> 02:22:19.001
<v Speaker 3>within this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That kind of led me to doing some </v>

3166
02:22:19.001 --> 02:22:22.001
<v Speaker 3>reading with Tony Robbins who had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who had started with a system called </v>

3167
02:22:22.001 --> 02:22:26.951
<v Speaker 3>neuro linguistics programming that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of founded a lot of the work that </v>

3168
02:22:26.951 --> 02:22:26.951
<v Speaker 3>Milton Erickson had done.</v>

3169
02:22:26.951 --> 02:22:31.850
<v Speaker 1>Within all of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a strategy for helping someone </v>

3170
02:22:31.850 --> 02:22:31.850
<v Speaker 1>break phobias.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here I am,</v>

3171
02:22:31.850 --> 02:22:33.210
<v Speaker 1>26 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>completely intense,</v>

3172
02:22:33.211 --> 02:22:35.820
<v Speaker 1>and this woman comes to see me for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>seizures,</v>

3173
02:22:36.030 --> 02:22:38.070
<v Speaker 1>this back pain and finds that she has </v>
<v Speaker 1>seizures.</v>

3174
02:22:38.640 --> 02:22:42.060
<v Speaker 1>So I do this process with her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of like this imagination thing</v>

3175
02:22:42.061 --> 02:22:44.370
<v Speaker 1>and you basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you break this neurological pattern that</v>

3176
02:22:44.371 --> 02:22:45.510
<v Speaker 1>happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

3177
02:22:45.511 --> 02:22:47.760
<v Speaker 1>you're going to go home today and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to pick up a frog.</v>

3178
02:22:48.210 --> 02:22:50.970
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I get a call an hour later,</v>

3179
02:22:51.210 --> 02:22:53.460
<v Speaker 1>I get called on I or she picks up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

3180
02:22:53.461 --> 02:22:54.200
<v Speaker 1>hello?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She goes,</v>

3181
02:22:54.220 --> 02:22:54.900
<v Speaker 1>Dr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Parsons.</v>

3182
02:22:55.110 --> 02:22:56.910
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm holding a frog.</v>

3183
02:22:56.911 --> 02:22:57.420
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she goes,</v>

3184
02:22:57.421 --> 02:22:59.370
<v Speaker 1>I can't pick them up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

3185
02:22:59.371 --> 02:23:01.710
<v Speaker 1>where are you right now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I'm right in front of him.</v>

3186
02:23:01.740 --> 02:23:02.580
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how close?</v>

3187
02:23:03.430 --> 02:23:04.290
<v Speaker 1>She says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two feet.</v>

3188
02:23:05.400 --> 02:23:06.000
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

3189
02:23:06.060 --> 02:23:08.460
<v Speaker 1>you'll pick them up tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I hung the phone.</v>

3190
02:23:08.860 --> 02:23:12.690
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is some Miyagi shit now.</v>

3191
02:23:12.691 --> 02:23:14.040
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not actually.</v>

3192
02:23:14.041 --> 02:23:15.960
<v Speaker 1>If you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you learn these patterns of,</v>

3193
02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:18.750
<v Speaker 1>of how you learn how to break someone's </v>
<v Speaker 1>pattern,</v>

3194
02:23:18.960 --> 02:23:21.000
<v Speaker 1>you can create a whole different set of </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior right now.</v>

3195
02:23:21.070 --> 02:23:25.450
<v Speaker 1>What does this learning of how to break </v>
<v Speaker 1>these patterns essentially based on what</v>

3196
02:23:25.451 --> 02:23:28.850
<v Speaker 1>is it based on trial and error?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it based on hard science?</v>

3197
02:23:28.851 --> 02:23:30.000
<v Speaker 1>It's not my truck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3198
02:23:30.001 --> 02:23:31.260
<v Speaker 1>these are soft sciences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3199
02:23:31.261 --> 02:23:34.080
<v Speaker 1>Psychology is a soft science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't measure it in that sense.</v>

3200
02:23:34.081 --> 02:23:36.570
<v Speaker 1>But in this woman's case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three days later,</v>

3201
02:23:36.571 --> 02:23:38.480
<v Speaker 1>she changed her whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She say she,</v>

3202
02:23:38.481 --> 02:23:42.210
<v Speaker 1>she's now creating little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>little she'd put water at for them.</v>

3203
02:23:42.870 --> 02:23:47.870
<v Speaker 1>It changed her whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know who her husband wants to </v>

3204
02:23:47.870 --> 02:23:47.870
<v Speaker 1>kill me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

3205
02:23:47.870 --> 02:23:49.320
<v Speaker 1>This his wife was no longer this meek,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fearful woman named more.</v>

3206
02:23:49.321 --> 02:23:50.980
<v Speaker 1>She got her voice back her.</v>

3207
02:23:51.290 --> 02:23:53.110
<v Speaker 1>So the husband was a mad at you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Curve.</v>

3208
02:23:53.130 --> 02:23:56.070
<v Speaker 1>Husband was furious with me because his </v>
<v Speaker 1>wife was gone.</v>

3209
02:23:56.650 --> 02:23:57.390
<v Speaker 1>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

3210
02:23:57.690 --> 02:24:00.600
<v Speaker 1>you break this one pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One area effected everything else in her</v>

3211
02:24:00.601 --> 02:24:05.601
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Her mother in law came to see me and </v>

3212
02:24:05.601 --> 02:24:05.601
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't do that Voodoo on me.</v>

3213
02:24:05.601 --> 02:24:09.051
<v Speaker 1>I lost like five patients in a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 1>money over this because you make a </v>

3214
02:24:09.051 --> 02:24:13.071
<v Speaker 1>change in someone's life in this sense </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it changes the whole direction of </v>

3215
02:24:13.071 --> 02:24:14.070
<v Speaker 1>other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other parts of their lives.</v>

3216
02:24:14.071 --> 02:24:19.071
<v Speaker 1>And it all comes from these whatever </v>
<v Speaker 1>type of pattern that we're running in </v>

3217
02:24:19.071 --> 02:24:19.071
<v Speaker 1>our head here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So me,</v>

3218
02:24:19.071 --> 02:24:23.571
<v Speaker 1>I go back to wrestling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My pattern was I can hang with these </v>

3219
02:24:23.571 --> 02:24:26.151
<v Speaker 1>guys and I achieve that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You work with a sports psychologist if </v>

3220
02:24:26.151 --> 02:24:26.151
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you get a mental break,</v>

3221
02:24:26.151 --> 02:24:30.621
<v Speaker 1>I'd imagine Anderson will probably talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>to someone for breaking his leg like </v>

3222
02:24:30.621 --> 02:24:30.621
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

3223
02:24:30.621 --> 02:24:31.230
<v Speaker 1>I believe he is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3224
02:24:31.240 --> 02:24:36.240
<v Speaker 1>You have to learn how to process and </v>
<v Speaker 1>deal with these things and for me it's </v>

3225
02:24:36.361 --> 02:24:38.880
<v Speaker 1>so important not just in fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting sick,</v>

3226
02:24:38.890 --> 02:24:43.890
<v Speaker 1>this extreme kind of way of living,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but something that everyone can benefit </v>

3227
02:24:43.890 --> 02:24:44.830
<v Speaker 1>from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3228
02:24:44.850 --> 02:24:49.850
<v Speaker 1>That's tough science thing though is </v>
<v Speaker 1>real tricky because a lot of the </v>

3229
02:24:49.850 --> 02:24:54.230
<v Speaker 1>benefits of something or a lot of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>success in doing something like that is </v>

3230
02:24:54.230 --> 02:24:55.710
<v Speaker 1>based on the confidence that you have in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the therapy.</v>

3231
02:24:56.070 --> 02:24:59.040
<v Speaker 1>Like if you believe that you can change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you believe it can help you at work,</v>

3232
02:24:59.310 --> 02:25:01.950
<v Speaker 1>but if you'll like this shit ain't going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to work.</v>

3233
02:25:01.980 --> 02:25:02.730
<v Speaker 1>Go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Try it.</v>

3234
02:25:02.790 --> 02:25:05.400
<v Speaker 1>See it didn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know that stuff doesn't work.</v>

3235
02:25:05.470 --> 02:25:07.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can have that attitude.</v>

3236
02:25:07.620 --> 02:25:12.620
<v Speaker 1>St People could go into the same office </v>
<v Speaker 1>and deal with the same counselor and </v>

3237
02:25:12.751 --> 02:25:17.751
<v Speaker 1>have a similar issue and the depending </v>
<v Speaker 1>upon their confidence in that type of </v>

3238
02:25:17.751 --> 02:25:22.041
<v Speaker 1>therapy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of it is based on the belief in </v>

3239
02:25:22.041 --> 02:25:22.041
<v Speaker 1>change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same thing with coaching,</v>

3240
02:25:22.041 --> 02:25:22.490
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3241
02:25:22.500 --> 02:25:24.080
<v Speaker 1>I could have two athletes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can</v>

3242
02:25:24.400 --> 02:25:29.400
<v Speaker 3>do the all the same stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One will believe it and this has </v>

3243
02:25:29.400 --> 02:25:29.400
<v Speaker 3>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One doesn't.</v>

3244
02:25:29.400 --> 02:25:33.000
<v Speaker 3>One will succeed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the other won't have to go somewhere </v>

3245
02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:33.000
<v Speaker 3>else,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think you can change this.</v>

3246
02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:36.991
<v Speaker 3>I went to this for years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He sends his mother a skydiving </v>

3247
02:25:36.991 --> 02:25:38.050
<v Speaker 3>instructor and I always see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>come on,</v>

3248
02:25:38.051 --> 02:25:41.440
<v Speaker 3>let's go skydiving.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I made up some bullshit excuse about</v>

3249
02:25:41.441 --> 02:25:46.441
<v Speaker 3>how I didn't want to go skydiving,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in the back of my head it kind of </v>

3250
02:25:46.441 --> 02:25:46.780
<v Speaker 3>bothered me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I had this skydiving fear linked up.</v>

3251
02:25:46.781 --> 02:25:49.870
<v Speaker 3>So as soon as I kind of learn how to </v>
<v Speaker 3>take control and direct my own mind,</v>

3252
02:25:49.871 --> 02:25:54.871
<v Speaker 3>I decided I'm going to go skydiving.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is in Australia and I go down </v>

3253
02:25:54.871 --> 02:25:55.570
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

3254
02:25:55.571 --> 02:25:56.140
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to do.</v>

3255
02:25:56.141 --> 02:25:58.030
<v Speaker 3>It's a tandem jump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's attached to my back.</v>

3256
02:25:59.170 --> 02:26:00.070
<v Speaker 3>We'd go up in the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I watched him,</v>

3257
02:26:00.071 --> 02:26:01.150
<v Speaker 3>I watched them pack the shoot.</v>

3258
02:26:01.150 --> 02:26:04.810
<v Speaker 3>We go up in the airplane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's over the Sunday island,</v>

3259
02:26:04.811 --> 02:26:06.790
<v Speaker 3>73 tropical islands.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's beautiful.</v>

3260
02:26:06.791 --> 02:26:10.430
<v Speaker 3>I hire a camera man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have an ounce of fear whatsoever</v>

3261
02:26:10.431 --> 02:26:11.710
<v Speaker 3>in my body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3262
02:26:12.030 --> 02:26:17.030
<v Speaker 3>At the time I couldn't have felt better </v>
<v Speaker 3>and my job really is just when he taps </v>

3263
02:26:17.030 --> 02:26:21.091
<v Speaker 3>me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my job is to arch back because he has </v>

3264
02:26:21.091 --> 02:26:21.091
<v Speaker 3>the shoot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so he tapped me.</v>

3265
02:26:21.091 --> 02:26:25.360
<v Speaker 3>I archbeck we pull the shooting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At that moment I knew something was </v>

3266
02:26:25.360 --> 02:26:25.360
<v Speaker 3>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

3267
02:26:25.360 --> 02:26:30.270
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how I knew something was </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrong and then I'm looking down and he </v>

3268
02:26:30.270 --> 02:26:34.831
<v Speaker 3>yells in my ear for words I'll never </v>
<v Speaker 3>forget we're having a malfunction.</v>

3269
02:26:36.170 --> 02:26:41.170
<v Speaker 3>And at that point everything stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I remember looking down in the </v>

3270
02:26:41.170 --> 02:26:41.410
<v Speaker 3>first,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is what came to my head.</v>

3271
02:26:41.440 --> 02:26:46.440
<v Speaker 3>No motion as calm as can be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the first time in my life I've </v>

3272
02:26:46.440 --> 02:26:47.890
<v Speaker 3>ever been completely committed to </v>
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

3273
02:26:48.280 --> 02:26:51.670
<v Speaker 3>That's the thought I had.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I look,</v>

3274
02:26:51.700 --> 02:26:54.190
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>chute opens up again.</v>

3275
02:26:54.191 --> 02:26:57.010
<v Speaker 3>We dropped like a sack of potatoes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't realize that,</v>

3276
02:26:57.310 --> 02:27:02.310
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause the shoot had folded over on </v>

3277
02:27:02.310 --> 02:27:04.531
<v Speaker 3>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it had slowed us down some but not </v>

3278
02:27:04.531 --> 02:27:06.991
<v Speaker 3>nearly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now we're going to die if we tried to </v>

3279
02:27:06.991 --> 02:27:06.991
<v Speaker 3>land with that shoot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he cuts it.</v>

3280
02:27:06.991 --> 02:27:08.980
<v Speaker 3>When you drop really fast again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then he opens the reserve chute.</v>

3281
02:27:09.910 --> 02:27:11.560
<v Speaker 3>So at this point it doesn't say anything</v>
<v Speaker 3>to me,</v>

3282
02:27:11.561 --> 02:27:12.370
<v Speaker 3>and I asked him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

3283
02:27:12.371 --> 02:27:14.350
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now he's on my back,</v>

3284
02:27:14.370 --> 02:27:16.510
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are we going to be okay?</v>

3285
02:27:16.860 --> 02:27:18.490
<v Speaker 3>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3286
02:27:18.491 --> 02:27:19.870
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3287
02:27:19.871 --> 02:27:20.200
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

3288
02:27:20.201 --> 02:27:21.310
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to be okay.</v>

3289
02:27:22.420 --> 02:27:23.230
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

3290
02:27:23.590 --> 02:27:25.690
<v Speaker 3>I need more certainty in your voice </v>
<v Speaker 3>right now,</v>

3291
02:27:25.970 --> 02:27:27.440
<v Speaker 3>but he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to be alright.</v>

3292
02:27:27.550 --> 02:27:28.870
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you tell me that again.</v>

3293
02:27:28.871 --> 02:27:29.690
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to be our,</v>

3294
02:27:29.720 --> 02:27:31.130
<v Speaker 3>so we're going to be all right.</v>

3295
02:27:31.240 --> 02:27:32.980
<v Speaker 3>Tell me one more time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then we landed and it was,</v>

3296
02:27:33.030 --> 02:27:38.030
<v Speaker 3>it's on youtube somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I actually posted a young Ryan jumping </v>

3297
02:27:38.030 --> 02:27:38.760
<v Speaker 3>out of a plane,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it didn't make me nervous.</v>

3298
02:27:38.761 --> 02:27:40.660
<v Speaker 3>Just sitting here listening to this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But again,</v>

3299
02:27:40.661 --> 02:27:43.660
<v Speaker 3>I think when you talk about emotional </v>
<v Speaker 3>management,</v>

3300
02:27:43.840 --> 02:27:47.380
<v Speaker 3>I think that this is a skill that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>can learn,</v>

3301
02:27:47.700 --> 02:27:52.700
<v Speaker 3>that you can under very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very stressful and high pressure </v>

3302
02:27:52.700 --> 02:27:55.540
<v Speaker 3>situations that is a learned skill that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you can deal with and being able to work</v>

3303
02:27:55.541 --> 02:28:00.541
<v Speaker 3>on that stuff personally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to help other people through it and to </v>

3304
02:28:00.541 --> 02:28:02.500
<v Speaker 3>have experiences like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You find yourself in other circumstances</v>

3305
02:28:02.501 --> 02:28:04.960
<v Speaker 3>where all of a sudden you're under </v>
<v Speaker 3>stress and you can perform,</v>

3306
02:28:04.990 --> 02:28:08.230
<v Speaker 3>and that's what the masters do when when</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the pressure's on,</v>

3307
02:28:08.920 --> 02:28:13.920
<v Speaker 3>everything's on the line right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you going to step up and perform or </v>

3308
02:28:13.920 --> 02:28:16.681
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think that to ignore that </v>

3309
02:28:16.681 --> 02:28:19.411
<v Speaker 3>component for an MMA fighter who's </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting in their underwear and fighting </v>

3310
02:28:19.411 --> 02:28:22.951
<v Speaker 3>for their lunch money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you absolutely need to spend time </v>

3311
02:28:22.951 --> 02:28:22.951
<v Speaker 3>and</v>

3312
02:28:22.951 --> 02:28:26.980
<v Speaker 1>effort developing that side of yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you should have people surrounding </v>

3313
02:28:26.980 --> 02:28:28.670
<v Speaker 1>you who can help you develop that </v>
<v Speaker 1>confidence because it does not happen in</v>

3314
02:28:28.671 --> 02:28:33.671
<v Speaker 1>a vacuum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's different for every person because </v>

3315
02:28:34.431 --> 02:28:36.380
<v Speaker 1>every person's going to have different </v>
<v Speaker 1>issues,</v>

3316
02:28:36.381 --> 02:28:39.950
<v Speaker 1>different things that they fear </v>
<v Speaker 1>different obstacles to overcome.</v>

3317
02:28:39.951 --> 02:28:43.520
<v Speaker 1>For some fighters it might have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting subbed for other fighters.</v>

3318
02:28:43.521 --> 02:28:48.521
<v Speaker 1>It might have been being code before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that fear of committing and getting </v>

3319
02:28:48.521 --> 02:28:49.060
<v Speaker 1>caught.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have k,</v>

3320
02:28:49.061 --> 02:28:52.260
<v Speaker 1>you have to have my kids have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Each one is different,</v>

3321
02:28:52.890 --> 02:28:56.310
<v Speaker 1>very different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So your.</v>

3322
02:28:56.320 --> 02:28:59.120
<v Speaker 1>You're challenging the father is to find</v>
<v Speaker 1>out ways that you can get.</v>

3323
02:28:59.121 --> 02:29:00.410
<v Speaker 1>It's all about leadership,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3324
02:29:00.770 --> 02:29:03.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and for me leadership is about influence</v>

3325
02:29:04.230 --> 02:29:09.230
<v Speaker 1>and it's about service,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you find out what these people </v>

3326
02:29:09.230 --> 02:29:11.300
<v Speaker 1>really need and then you can help </v>
<v Speaker 1>influence them in that direction,</v>

3327
02:29:11.750 --> 02:29:15.830
<v Speaker 1>then people are going to rise to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>levels that they never dreamed of and to</v>

3328
02:29:15.831 --> 02:29:19.430
<v Speaker 1>me that if you're in a position of </v>
<v Speaker 1>leadership that has to be your focus.</v>

3329
02:29:19.430 --> 02:29:21.560
<v Speaker 1>That's where it's really difficult to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>a manager.</v>

3330
02:29:21.561 --> 02:29:25.440
<v Speaker 1>It's gotta be difficult to a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially because you're.</v>

3331
02:29:25.510 --> 02:29:27.170
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're professional.</v>

3332
02:29:27.470 --> 02:29:32.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your profession relies on other people </v>

3333
02:29:32.470 --> 02:29:33.260
<v Speaker 1>putting all these pieces together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You helping them,</v>

3334
02:29:33.500 --> 02:29:36.050
<v Speaker 1>but God it all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ultimately,</v>

3335
02:29:36.051 --> 02:29:38.750
<v Speaker 1>once that cage door shuts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't do a goddamn thing.</v>

3336
02:29:39.050 --> 02:29:42.320
<v Speaker 1>You have to sit there and watch the work</v>
<v Speaker 1>and hope that it all took.</v>

3337
02:29:42.950 --> 02:29:44.480
<v Speaker 1>That's jeff and Shandor's life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3338
02:29:44.660 --> 02:29:45.540
<v Speaker 1>Sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3339
02:29:45.541 --> 02:29:46.060
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3340
02:29:46.061 --> 02:29:47.680
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do something.</v>

3341
02:29:47.890 --> 02:29:49.790
<v Speaker 1>What'd you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A comedy special on that too long ago,</v>

3342
02:29:50.360 --> 02:29:52.100
<v Speaker 1>so they have to sit there and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>

3343
02:29:52.101 --> 02:29:55.070
<v Speaker 1>I hope all this is going to work out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe's on stage,</v>

3344
02:29:55.071 --> 02:29:57.350
<v Speaker 1>so I'm confident in them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's the job.</v>

3345
02:29:57.410 --> 02:29:58.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's tricky.</v>

3346
02:29:58.971 --> 02:30:01.550
<v Speaker 1>It's a tricky gehrig.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm too much of a control freak.</v>

3347
02:30:01.551 --> 02:30:06.551
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I'd be real good at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that the mindset that you have is </v>

3348
02:30:06.551 --> 02:30:10.571
<v Speaker 1>someone on the talent side of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>equation is totally different than </v>

3349
02:30:10.571 --> 02:30:14.051
<v Speaker 1>someone on the management side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so hopefully you understand where they </v>

3350
02:30:14.051 --> 02:30:18.491
<v Speaker 1>come from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the challenge that happened in their </v>

3351
02:30:18.491 --> 02:30:18.491
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

3352
02:30:18.491 --> 02:30:19.340
<v Speaker 1>You try to be better at that and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>have empathy and understand the pressure</v>

3353
02:30:19.341 --> 02:30:24.341
<v Speaker 1>that comes from being talent and being </v>
<v Speaker 1>the one out there with the spotlight on </v>

3354
02:30:24.341 --> 02:30:24.860
<v Speaker 1>them and they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They adjust their approach for that.</v>

3355
02:30:25.590 --> 02:30:28.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a when it all comes together,</v>

3356
02:30:28.200 --> 02:30:30.230
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's magical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's magical,</v>

3357
02:30:30.920 --> 02:30:32.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's so hard.</v>

3358
02:30:33.120 --> 02:30:37.970
<v Speaker 1>It's unbelievably hard to find the right</v>
<v Speaker 1>manager,</v>

3359
02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:41.060
<v Speaker 1>the right athlete,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the right training environment,</v>

3360
02:30:41.360 --> 02:30:45.530
<v Speaker 1>the right training partners,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the right scenario in life.</v>

3361
02:30:45.680 --> 02:30:47.480
<v Speaker 1>And then the other stuff that we talked </v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

3362
02:30:47.510 --> 02:30:49.310
<v Speaker 1>the right girlfriend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the right wife,</v>

3363
02:30:49.340 --> 02:30:50.510
<v Speaker 1>right boyfriend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the right,</v>

3364
02:30:50.511 --> 02:30:51.680
<v Speaker 1>whatever the fuck it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

3365
02:30:51.890 --> 02:30:56.890
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the support system that you have at </v>

3366
02:30:56.890 --> 02:30:56.890
<v Speaker 1>home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You mean how many fighters have you seen</v>

3367
02:30:56.890 --> 02:31:00.851
<v Speaker 1>go off the rails because their </v>
<v Speaker 1>girlfriend breaks up with them or their </v>

3368
02:31:00.851 --> 02:31:04.871
<v Speaker 1>girlfriend will fucking demand attention</v>
<v Speaker 1>right before a fight and cause fucking </v>

3369
02:31:05.690 --> 02:31:09.260
<v Speaker 1>girlfriend and a fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I managed steal his fight shorts,</v>

3370
02:31:09.261 --> 02:31:11.450
<v Speaker 1>mouthpiece and cup two days before the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>

3371
02:31:11.820 --> 02:31:15.440
<v Speaker 1>Refuse to give them back for two days </v>
<v Speaker 1>because she wanted attention.</v>

3372
02:31:15.550 --> 02:31:16.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3373
02:31:17.050 --> 02:31:19.100
<v Speaker 1>But who gets to deal with that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You.</v>

3374
02:31:19.280 --> 02:31:20.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what'd you do?</v>

3375
02:31:20.680 --> 02:31:25.680
<v Speaker 3>The longer story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Long story would have to check me for a </v>

3376
02:31:25.680 --> 02:31:28.560
<v Speaker 3>microphone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All these crazy things start to happen.</v>

3377
02:31:28.561 --> 02:31:28.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3378
02:31:29.050 --> 02:31:31.360
<v Speaker 2>of course he has the pressure pressure </v>
<v Speaker 2>shows,</v>

3379
02:31:31.361 --> 02:31:32.860
<v Speaker 2>cracks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3380
02:31:32.861 --> 02:31:37.861
<v Speaker 2>everything is nice and easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As long as the water pressure's really </v>

3381
02:31:37.861 --> 02:31:39.370
<v Speaker 2>relaxed and simple and nice to trick a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little creek,</v>

3382
02:31:39.430 --> 02:31:43.210
<v Speaker 2>but when it's all fucking river,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that leads up to Niagara Falls.</v>

3383
02:31:43.570 --> 02:31:44.640
<v Speaker 2>Boy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does that expose</v>

3384
02:31:44.680 --> 02:31:45.850
<v Speaker 3>the cracks?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen that.</v>

3385
02:31:46.210 --> 02:31:51.210
<v Speaker 3>I've had people in corners.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been fortunate to be involved this </v>

3386
02:31:51.210 --> 02:31:51.760
<v Speaker 3>the stages of athlete development from </v>
<v Speaker 3>the beginning.</v>

3387
02:31:51.761 --> 02:31:53.020
<v Speaker 3>You just got here too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3388
02:31:53.021 --> 02:31:55.060
<v Speaker 3>you're a world champion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very different.</v>

3389
02:31:55.061 --> 02:31:58.660
<v Speaker 3>And you have to know if you're on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>management side of things and training,</v>

3390
02:31:58.661 --> 02:32:03.661
<v Speaker 3>you have to know how each of those </v>
<v Speaker 3>stages are different because you can </v>

3391
02:32:03.661 --> 02:32:04.990
<v Speaker 3>spin off the rails at any moment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I've seen people crack on the corner</v>

3392
02:32:04.991 --> 02:32:09.310
<v Speaker 3>before it took.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It took me five or six years of being in</v>

3393
02:32:09.311 --> 02:32:11.740
<v Speaker 3>corners before I was really like right </v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

3394
02:32:11.741 --> 02:32:13.930
<v Speaker 3>And I sit in the corner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not at all emotional.</v>

3395
02:32:14.230 --> 02:32:16.170
<v Speaker 3>I see things super clear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see.</v>

3396
02:32:16.540 --> 02:32:19.240
<v Speaker 3>But that took years to develop your </v>
<v Speaker 3>would imagine.</v>

3397
02:32:19.460 --> 02:32:23.140
<v Speaker 3>Imagine being unbelievably difficult </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing to wrap your head around.</v>

3398
02:32:23.590 --> 02:32:25.660
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure it's similar to you calling </v>
<v Speaker 3>fights,</v>

3399
02:32:25.661 --> 02:32:27.090
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The first couple,</v>

3400
02:32:27.130 --> 02:32:28.540
<v Speaker 3>maybe a year or two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You do it.</v>

3401
02:32:28.541 --> 02:32:28.930
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>

3402
02:32:29.720 --> 02:32:31.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was worried about everything that came</v>

3403
02:32:31.461 --> 02:32:35.900
<v Speaker 2>out of my mouth and the fuck I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying like talking too much.</v>

3404
02:32:35.930 --> 02:32:38.570
<v Speaker 2>Am I talking too little?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Am I being an idiot?</v>

3405
02:32:38.690 --> 02:32:39.860
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a lot,</v>

3406
02:32:40.360 --> 02:32:43.900
<v Speaker 3>but if you're the guy in the mic putting</v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself out there,</v>

3407
02:32:43.901 --> 02:32:46.800
<v Speaker 3>there's gonna be a whole bunch of people</v>
<v Speaker 3>hate everything that you say.</v>

3408
02:32:46.801 --> 02:32:48.860
<v Speaker 3>And there'll be some that like it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And yeah,</v>

3409
02:32:48.910 --> 02:32:52.040
<v Speaker 3>that's also.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I a lot of</v>

3410
02:32:52.040 --> 02:32:54.740
<v Speaker 2>different things like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm used to that,</v>

3411
02:32:54.950 --> 02:32:59.950
<v Speaker 2>like most of my life involves doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>things live that other people are going </v>

3412
02:33:00.161 --> 02:33:00.950
<v Speaker 2>to hear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3413
02:33:01.070 --> 02:33:06.070
<v Speaker 2>Like stand up podcasting and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing the UFC commentary are all live </v>

3414
02:33:07.041 --> 02:33:09.140
<v Speaker 2>things that other people are going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>hear.</v>

3415
02:33:09.470 --> 02:33:11.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you get used to that.</v>

3416
02:33:11.391 --> 02:33:14.870
<v Speaker 2>And so you got to be super honest about </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself.</v>

3417
02:33:14.960 --> 02:33:18.200
<v Speaker 2>You gotta be super honest about how you </v>
<v Speaker 2>would listen to yourself.</v>

3418
02:33:18.201 --> 02:33:23.201
<v Speaker 2>Like I would find me annoying sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to know when I would find me </v>

3419
02:33:23.201 --> 02:33:24.770
<v Speaker 2>annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people don't want to do that.</v>

3420
02:33:24.890 --> 02:33:28.520
<v Speaker 2>Like I have friends that are comics that</v>
<v Speaker 2>won't listen to the recordings or God.</v>

3421
02:33:28.521 --> 02:33:29.300
<v Speaker 2>Hey listening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

3422
02:33:29.301 --> 02:33:30.920

<v Speaker 2>I don't like listening to me either.</v>

3423
02:33:30.921 --> 02:33:33.110
<v Speaker 2>I fucking hate everything I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me tell you this right now.</v>

3424
02:33:33.320 --> 02:33:35.810
<v Speaker 2>Everything I fucking do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they'll be like,</v>

3425
02:33:36.050 --> 02:33:37.790
<v Speaker 2>I sat down with my friend already the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other day,</v>

3426
02:33:37.791 --> 02:33:38.480

<v Speaker 2>And one of the things that he's been </v>

3428

<v Speaker 2>doing lately is going over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

<v Speaker 2>comedy records like that you did in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>past.</v>

3430
02:33:48.111 --> 02:33:53.111
<v Speaker 2>Like the play it for you and like what </v>
<v Speaker 2>was this bit based on what we think and </v>

3431

<v Speaker 2>here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you think when you hear this </v>

3432
02:33:57.701 --> 02:33:57.701
<v Speaker 2>bit?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like,</v>

3433
02:33:57.701 --> 02:34:00.120
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we did like one of my favorite all time </v>

<v Speaker 2>cds was shiny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>happy Jihad and every,</v>

3435
02:34:00.740 --> 02:34:02.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>second or third bit.</v>

3436
02:34:02.661 --> 02:34:04.280
<v Speaker 2>I really said like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a good,</v>

3437
02:34:04.310 --> 02:34:05.600
<v Speaker 2>I love that bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a great band.</v>

3438
02:34:05.780 --> 02:34:06.920
<v Speaker 2>But the other ones were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3439
02:34:06.921 --> 02:34:09.560
<v Speaker 2>this fucking back or cut that out and </v>
<v Speaker 2>shorten this,</v>

3440
02:34:09.590 --> 02:34:12.920
<v Speaker 2>Trim that and add it to this or I don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>like how I said that.</v>

3441
02:34:12.921 --> 02:34:14.480
<v Speaker 2>Or just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the cit tries,</v>

3442
02:34:14.481 --> 02:34:17.350
<v Speaker 2>you're fucking crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if it doesn't drive you crazy,</v>

3443
02:34:17.800 --> 02:34:18.100
<v Speaker 2>you're</v>

3444
02:34:18.100 --> 02:34:20.910
<v Speaker 3>not paying attention.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that's sort of sports psychologists</v>

3445
02:34:20.920 --> 02:34:25.920
<v Speaker 3>will to too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'll sit down and they'll watch you </v>

3446
02:34:25.920 --> 02:34:25.920
<v Speaker 3>go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What were you thinking here?</v>

3447
02:34:25.920 --> 02:34:28.240
<v Speaker 3>When Ryan came up to you in the cage and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said this to you,</v>

3448
02:34:28.241 --> 02:34:30.310
<v Speaker 3>what were you thinking there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they've told me to Ryan,</v>

3449
02:34:30.311 --> 02:34:31.750
<v Speaker 3>we in the cage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw you do this.</v>

3450
02:34:31.751 --> 02:34:34.960
<v Speaker 3>They'll say those things to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the athletes have to go through.</v>

3451
02:34:34.961 --> 02:34:36.190
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you went out there,</v>

3452
02:34:36.191 --> 02:34:41.191
<v Speaker 3>where was your focus when you're doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'd use this by called an air assault </v>

3453
02:34:41.191 --> 02:34:41.191
<v Speaker 3>bike.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's like a.</v>

3454
02:34:41.191 --> 02:34:43.270
<v Speaker 3>it's like a Schwinn airdyne bike on </v>
<v Speaker 3>steroids and things.</v>

3455
02:34:43.271 --> 02:34:44.000
<v Speaker 3>Amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's it called?</v>

3456
02:34:44.260 --> 02:34:47.140
<v Speaker 3>It's called an era assault air bike or </v>
<v Speaker 3>air assault bike.</v>

3457
02:34:48.380 --> 02:34:51.000
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the same principle of a,</v>

3458
02:34:51.001 --> 02:34:54.040
<v Speaker 3>a Schwinn airdyne bike,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's built like a tank.</v>

3459
02:34:54.041 --> 02:34:56.050
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's amazing and it's,</v>

3460
02:34:56.100 --> 02:34:57.790
<v Speaker 3>it's the worst horror.</v>

3461
02:34:57.820 --> 02:35:00.820
<v Speaker 3>It's just terrible to be on that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But salt air bike.</v>

3462
02:35:00.880 --> 02:35:05.880
<v Speaker 3>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we use Arrow Dong because I get on </v>

3463
02:35:05.880 --> 02:35:06.940
<v Speaker 3>that different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>

3464
02:35:06.941 --> 02:35:08.950
<v Speaker 3>it's an Airdyne bike,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the way it's geared,</v>

3465
02:35:08.951 --> 02:35:13.951
<v Speaker 3>it's that thing is horrible and this is </v>
<v Speaker 3>what we use for our conditioning now </v>

3466
02:35:13.951 --> 02:35:17.551
<v Speaker 3>because there's no stress in your body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Dennis actually has been using the </v>

3467
02:35:17.551 --> 02:35:20.651
<v Speaker 3>hypoxic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's got a mask on his face simulating </v>

3468
02:35:20.651 --> 02:35:23.221
<v Speaker 3>9,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>feet and he gets on and spring thing </v>

3469
02:35:23.221 --> 02:35:25.520
<v Speaker 3>three five minute rounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So these are these better than like </v>

3470
02:35:25.520 --> 02:35:26.920
<v Speaker 3>elliptical machines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a whole different animal.</v>

3471
02:35:26.950 --> 02:35:27.780
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3472
02:35:27.790 --> 02:35:32.790
<v Speaker 3>If I could put you in 20 seconds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can be wishing that your about me.</v>

3473
02:35:34.150 --> 02:35:36.630
<v Speaker 3>Let's do it in about 10 seconds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>10 seconds.</v>

3474
02:35:37.390 --> 02:35:38.610
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3475
02:35:38.680 --> 02:35:40.210
<v Speaker 3>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3476
02:35:40.750 --> 02:35:42.330
<v Speaker 3>we put people on this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3477
02:35:42.340 --> 02:35:43.630
<v Speaker 3>Dan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm Caitlyn,</v>

3478
02:35:43.631 --> 02:35:48.631
<v Speaker 3>does this dentists use it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pat uses it and then it becomes a mind </v>

3479
02:35:48.631 --> 02:35:49.090
<v Speaker 3>because you're doing the work that </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't move.</v>

3480
02:35:49.090 --> 02:35:54.090
<v Speaker 3>You have to move it and there's a gauge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We record all your numbers for every </v>

3481
02:35:54.090 --> 02:35:57.481
<v Speaker 3>sprint.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we know at the beginning of camp </v>

3482
02:35:57.481 --> 02:35:57.481
<v Speaker 3>where there's numbers look like to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>end of the camp.</v>

3483
02:35:57.481 --> 02:36:01.920
<v Speaker 3>So what do you do when you have them do </v>
<v Speaker 3>like 30 seconds to do style sprints.</v>

3484
02:36:02.170 --> 02:36:07.170
<v Speaker 3>So what is to explain the Tabata </v>
<v Speaker 3>protocol for people who don't know what </v>

3485
02:36:07.170 --> 02:36:10.611
<v Speaker 3>it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>20 seconds of work followed by 10 </v>

3486
02:36:10.611 --> 02:36:12.901
<v Speaker 3>seconds of rest and we start out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Traditionally we're four minutes and so </v>

3487
02:36:12.901 --> 02:36:14.830
<v Speaker 3>we start at the beginning of the camp,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe once a week,</v>

3488
02:36:14.831 --> 02:36:19.831
<v Speaker 3>one round to four minutes and we up it </v>
<v Speaker 3>to two rounds and we go to five minutes </v>

3489
02:36:19.831 --> 02:36:23.011
<v Speaker 3>to simulate the rounds in a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But we have all the data and I'm big on </v>

3490
02:36:23.011 --> 02:36:27.421
<v Speaker 3>data and numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to see are we doing what's </v>

3491
02:36:27.421 --> 02:36:27.421
<v Speaker 3>working right?</v>

3492
02:36:27.421 --> 02:36:29.230
<v Speaker 3>Working heart rate preimposed I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's one thing we don't do,</v>

3493
02:36:29.231 --> 02:36:31.240
<v Speaker 3>that's probably the next thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but right now we don't,</v>

3494
02:36:31.241 --> 02:36:34.780
<v Speaker 3>we measure the watts on the bike so I </v>
<v Speaker 3>know their output as they're going.</v>

3495
02:36:35.380 --> 02:36:40.380
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so as far as the sports psychology side </v>

3496
02:36:40.380 --> 02:36:44.521
<v Speaker 3>of things that are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if that aerosol bike is so horrible </v>

3497
02:36:44.521 --> 02:36:45.190
<v Speaker 3>that you want to quit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it just feels terrible.</v>

3498
02:36:45.191 --> 02:36:50.191
<v Speaker 3>So it's one other way that we constantly</v>
<v Speaker 3>find ways to help help these guys keep </v>

3499
02:36:50.191 --> 02:36:52.540
<v Speaker 3>focus and push through and their bodies </v>
<v Speaker 3>opinion about hard to do that.</v>

3500
02:36:52.541 --> 02:36:56.500
<v Speaker 3>That thing is horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Called called it Satan's tryst.</v>

3501
02:36:58.140 --> 02:37:00.010
<v Speaker 3>Well this looks like a regular airdyne </v>
<v Speaker 3>bike,</v>

3502
02:37:00.011 --> 02:37:03.430
<v Speaker 3>but it looks pretty goddamn sturdy for </v>
<v Speaker 3>something you can't Pat Pat.</v>

3503
02:37:03.440 --> 02:37:04.030
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rebecca,</v>

3504
02:37:04.110 --> 02:37:09.110
<v Speaker 3>a Schwinn airdyne bike.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not strong enough to powerful </v>

3505
02:37:09.110 --> 02:37:10.120
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That bike right there.</v>

3506
02:37:10.270 --> 02:37:11.740
<v Speaker 3>You'll beat the fuck out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

3507
02:37:11.850 --> 02:37:13.510
<v Speaker 3>A cholesterol fitness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I one.</v>

3508
02:37:13.570 --> 02:37:15.770
<v Speaker 3>Those are the same guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's sold me that reverse hyper.</v>

3509
02:37:15.950 --> 02:37:16.210
<v Speaker 3>I</v>

3510
02:37:16.210 --> 02:37:17.660
<v Speaker 1>might have to pick one of these fuckers </v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

3511
02:37:17.690 --> 02:37:19.010
<v Speaker 1>It's horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm scared,</v>

3512
02:37:19.011 --> 02:37:20.840
<v Speaker 1>but I might have to get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about rowing?</v>

3513
02:37:21.380 --> 02:37:23.510
<v Speaker 1>I think the main thing with cardio and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3514
02:37:23.511 --> 02:37:27.320
<v Speaker 1>this is something new I just learned </v>
<v Speaker 1>from Andy Galpin who's a phd,</v>

3515
02:37:27.321 --> 02:37:32.321
<v Speaker 1>he's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's the guy who did the study on the </v>

3516
02:37:32.321 --> 02:37:34.001
<v Speaker 1>radius reps and he came back from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>conference to the latest data with </v>

3517
02:37:34.001 --> 02:37:36.410
<v Speaker 1>cardio stuff and heart health is if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing,</v>

3518
02:37:36.411 --> 02:37:41.411
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go for a walk or you do your little </v>

3519
02:37:41.411 --> 02:37:41.411
<v Speaker 1>easy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>30 minutes of Cardio,</v>

3520
02:37:41.411 --> 02:37:42.320
<v Speaker 1>you're not getting a cardiovascular </v>
<v Speaker 1>benefit from that.</v>

3521
02:37:42.680 --> 02:37:47.680
<v Speaker 1>You have to get so you're that your </v>
<v Speaker 1>heart rate is getting up so hard and so </v>

3522
02:37:47.680 --> 02:37:52.631
<v Speaker 1>high that you're better off doing these </v>
<v Speaker 1>high intensity sprint type workouts for </v>

3523
02:37:52.631 --> 02:37:53.790
<v Speaker 1>overall heart health.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3524
02:37:54.400 --> 02:37:56.570
<v Speaker 1>When you start talking crazy cardio or </v>
<v Speaker 1>start going,</v>

3525
02:37:57.770 --> 02:37:59.240
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to preparing,</v>

3526
02:37:59.660 --> 02:38:01.070
<v Speaker 1>preparing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that type of stuff.</v>

3527
02:38:01.580 --> 02:38:06.580
<v Speaker 1>I like pushing myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a big fan in getting to this hiccup </v>

3528
02:38:06.580 --> 02:38:08.390
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know there's one right there,</v>

3529
02:38:08.750 --> 02:38:13.750
<v Speaker 1>so this dude is doing sprints on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That probably doesn't do it justice </v>

3530
02:38:15.220 --> 02:38:17.110
<v Speaker 1>because he's opposed to say it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3531
02:38:17.120 --> 02:38:18.410
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't do us justice.</v>

3532
02:38:18.411 --> 02:38:20.180
<v Speaker 1>Why that thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that bike is horrible.</v>

3533
02:38:20.210 --> 02:38:22.550
<v Speaker 1>It breaks everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't beat it.</v>

3534
02:38:22.940 --> 02:38:23.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3535
02:38:23.781 --> 02:38:25.660
<v Speaker 1>it's impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have this opportunity.</v>

3536
02:38:25.680 --> 02:38:28.270
<v Speaker 1>This is the best machine for cardio flow</v>
<v Speaker 1>for shore.</v>

3537
02:38:28.340 --> 02:38:29.670
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3538
02:38:29.680 --> 02:38:31.430
<v Speaker 1>because because there's no stress in </v>
<v Speaker 1>your body.</v>

3539
02:38:31.431 --> 02:38:32.500
<v Speaker 1>You're getting upper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mid.</v>

3540
02:38:32.510 --> 02:38:37.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm pushing them out of the political </v>
<v Speaker 1>machines are key code and elliptical </v>

3541
02:38:37.880 --> 02:38:41.420
<v Speaker 1>pretty hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet you if you sprinted as hard as you</v>

3542
02:38:41.421 --> 02:38:46.421
<v Speaker 1>could on elliptical for 30 seconds or as</v>
<v Speaker 1>hard as you could on that for 30 </v>

3543
02:38:46.421 --> 02:38:46.421
<v Speaker 1>seconds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wouldn't even be in the same boat.</v>

3544
02:38:46.421 --> 02:38:46.790
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3545
02:38:47.240 --> 02:38:51.050
<v Speaker 1>I use a elliptical machine the way I </v>
<v Speaker 1>would do it for the most part,</v>

3546
02:38:51.230 --> 02:38:53.000
<v Speaker 1>don't follow to the bottom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I probably should.</v>

3547
02:38:53.300 --> 02:38:55.400
<v Speaker 1>I would just do 30 hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>30 hard,</v>

3548
02:38:55.401 --> 02:38:59.710
<v Speaker 1>30 off need to buy sometimes just if </v>
<v Speaker 1>just to keep it fresh with a 30,</v>

3549
02:38:59.720 --> 02:39:04.720
<v Speaker 1>30,</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] heart as you can go for </v>

3550
02:39:04.720 --> 02:39:07.361
<v Speaker 1>eight minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's all sorts of ways that you can </v>

3551
02:39:07.361 --> 02:39:09.191
<v Speaker 1>do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like I've had friends that like say </v>

3552
02:39:09.191 --> 02:39:09.191
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3553
02:39:09.191 --> 02:39:10.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm staying in a hotel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody fucking wait to hear.</v>

3554
02:39:10.341 --> 02:39:11.940
<v Speaker 1>I can't get a workout in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I be like,</v>

3555
02:39:12.020 --> 02:39:17.020
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you didn't get to work on it then come </v>

3556
02:39:17.020 --> 02:39:17.020
<v Speaker 1>do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what I do.</v>

3557
02:39:17.020 --> 02:39:17.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll do it at a hotel room,</v>

3558
02:39:17.230 --> 02:39:22.230
<v Speaker 1>a hotel gym.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's just have nothing but an </v>

3559
02:39:22.230 --> 02:39:22.230
<v Speaker 1>elliptical machine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll just crank that bitch.</v>

3560
02:39:22.230 --> 02:39:22.340
<v Speaker 1>What does it go up to?</v>
<v Speaker 1>17.</v>

3561
02:39:22.700 --> 02:39:23.550
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what you do.</v>

3562
02:39:23.551 --> 02:39:25.830
<v Speaker 1>You do 10 minutes at five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3563
02:39:25.840 --> 02:39:28.490
<v Speaker 1>you start getting everything lubed up </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then here we go.</v>

3564
02:39:28.520 --> 02:39:30.220
<v Speaker 1>Crank that fucker up to seven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're,</v>

3565
02:39:30.250 --> 02:39:31.930
<v Speaker 1>you're huffing and puffing at the end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3566
02:39:31.940 --> 02:39:32.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

3567
02:39:32.711 --> 02:39:34.820
<v Speaker 1>That's where all the benefit company </v>
<v Speaker 1>always comes from.</v>

3568
02:39:34.940 --> 02:39:36.590
<v Speaker 1>So I could just steady jog.</v>

3569
02:39:39.170 --> 02:39:40.170
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3570
02:39:40.171 --> 02:39:43.520
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to get like now doctor </v>
<v Speaker 1>gallon is telling me that when people.</v>

3571
02:39:43.521 --> 02:39:48.521
<v Speaker 1>Now that protocols for after heart </v>
<v Speaker 1>attacks is that you get that heart rate </v>

3572
02:39:48.521 --> 02:39:52.091
<v Speaker 1>up as quick as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get it moving again after a heart </v>

3573
02:39:52.091 --> 02:39:52.091
<v Speaker 1>attack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3574
02:39:52.091 --> 02:39:53.480
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just a quick,</v>

3575
02:39:53.481 --> 02:39:55.820
<v Speaker 1>quick conversation we had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not an expertise of mine.</v>

3576
02:39:55.821 --> 02:39:58.370
<v Speaker 1>He'd probably be a better person to ask,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>

3577
02:39:58.940 --> 02:39:59.360
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

3578
02:39:59.361 --> 02:40:01.790
<v Speaker 1>it changed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have guys who sprint a lot,</v>

3579
02:40:01.791 --> 02:40:03.290
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And all of a sudden you start to develop</v>

3580
02:40:03.291 --> 02:40:05.150
<v Speaker 1>a knee problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hip problems for it.</v>

3581
02:40:05.510 --> 02:40:10.510
<v Speaker 1>Jump on that aerosol bike.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to get all the cardio that </v>

3582
02:40:10.510 --> 02:40:10.510
<v Speaker 1>you need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3583
02:40:10.510 --> 02:40:11.210
<v Speaker 1>pat does a lot of mountain biking too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't he?</v>

3584
02:40:11.330 --> 02:40:12.110
<v Speaker 1>He does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

3585
02:40:12.620 --> 02:40:13.430
<v Speaker 1>He's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a.</v>

3586
02:40:13.440 --> 02:40:15.620
<v Speaker 1>that's a fucking hard workout.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good hills on.</v>

3587
02:40:15.680 --> 02:40:17.580
<v Speaker 1>On.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His favorite part is the climb.</v>

3588
02:40:17.820 --> 02:40:19.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just fucking psycho.</v>

3589
02:40:19.130 --> 02:40:20.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he loves.</v>

3590
02:40:20.250 --> 02:40:21.570
<v Speaker 1>You should see the numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He puts it.</v>

3591
02:40:21.571 --> 02:40:24.180
<v Speaker 1>I sent the numbers to the Aerosol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hear the numbers.</v>

3592
02:40:24.330 --> 02:40:24.860
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

3593
02:40:24.910 --> 02:40:26.760
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe anyone does numbers like</v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

3594
02:40:26.790 --> 02:40:31.790
<v Speaker 1>Like what kind of numbers on what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wouldn't mean anything to you unless </v>

3595
02:40:31.790 --> 02:40:34.401
<v Speaker 1>you got an untried it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he'll hit over [inaudible] watson a </v>

3596
02:40:34.401 --> 02:40:36.590
<v Speaker 1>sprint with that thing and for me to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>up to 1000 as hard or 1200.</v>

3597
02:40:36.610 --> 02:40:38.310
<v Speaker 1>So it's a matter of how much effort is </v>
<v Speaker 1>putting out.</v>

3598
02:40:38.370 --> 02:40:42.150
<v Speaker 1>It's all effort because it's air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The air pumps the fan,</v>

3599
02:40:42.320 --> 02:40:47.320
<v Speaker 1>like the fan is pumping air in the air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's basically a fan kind of scoops on </v>

3600
02:40:48.211 --> 02:40:48.930
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's hard.</v>

3601
02:40:48.931 --> 02:40:51.000
<v Speaker 1>As you're gonna move that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the work you're going to get.</v>

3602
02:40:51.100 --> 02:40:56.100
<v Speaker 1>The harder you push it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more resistance you get because the </v>

3603
02:40:56.100 --> 02:40:56.100
<v Speaker 1>more air it's pushing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3604
02:40:56.460 --> 02:40:57.330
<v Speaker 1>it's terrible.</v>

3605
02:41:00.210 --> 02:41:01.140
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3606
02:41:01.590 --> 02:41:03.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm ordering one right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Add to cart,</v>

3607
02:41:03.840 --> 02:41:05.070
<v Speaker 1>click.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

3608
02:41:05.220 --> 02:41:10.220
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think that there's other things </v>

3609
02:41:10.220 --> 02:41:12.870
<v Speaker 1>that could be developed that could maybe</v>
<v Speaker 1>be more effective for mma?</v>

3610
02:41:13.420 --> 02:41:16.090
<v Speaker 1>Like you liked it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember.</v>

3611
02:41:16.580 --> 02:41:20.300
<v Speaker 1>I think when you see this trend within,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially this,</v>

3612
02:41:20.400 --> 02:41:25.400
<v Speaker 1>this for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the strength and conditioning guys are </v>

3613
02:41:25.400 --> 02:41:27.661
<v Speaker 1>the most dangerous people in and in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighter's camp because they can hurt </v>

3614
02:41:27.661 --> 02:41:27.720
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can hurt them.</v>

3615
02:41:27.721 --> 02:41:30.260
<v Speaker 1>They had these weird egos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one can do my work yet.</v>

3616
02:41:30.261 --> 02:41:31.860
<v Speaker 1>I broke this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that type of thing.</v>

3617
02:41:32.100 --> 02:41:37.100
<v Speaker 1>The other problem that the fighters run </v>
<v Speaker 1>into is they go to gym a for their box </v>

3618
02:41:37.291 --> 02:41:39.690
<v Speaker 1>and they do their emma here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They could hear for Jujitsu.</v>

3619
02:41:39.691 --> 02:41:44.691
<v Speaker 1>They go here for strength and </v>
<v Speaker 1>conditioning and no one's talking to </v>

3620
02:41:44.691 --> 02:41:45.660
<v Speaker 1>each other because overtrain is a funny </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

3621
02:41:45.900 --> 02:41:48.690
<v Speaker 1>You can't really see it sometimes until </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's too late.</v>

3622
02:41:49.350 --> 02:41:54.350
<v Speaker 1>So I want to know now if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we had a hard day Monday and Tuesday </v>

3623
02:41:54.350 --> 02:41:57.720
<v Speaker 1>and pat and Katelyn are scheduled to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>work with Mel on Wednesday,</v>

3624
02:41:57.721 --> 02:41:59.100
<v Speaker 1>why let Michelle know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

3625
02:41:59.101 --> 02:42:00.840
<v Speaker 1>they're pretty fresh this week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Push him here.</v>

3626
02:42:01.110 --> 02:42:06.110
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kaylin was dropping your left hand work </v>

3627
02:42:06.110 --> 02:42:06.110
<v Speaker 1>on this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3628
02:42:06.110 --> 02:42:06.110
<v Speaker 1>pat's doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3629
02:42:06.110 --> 02:42:06.690
<v Speaker 1>you can push this and they need an easy </v>
<v Speaker 1>light day.</v>

3630
02:42:06.691 --> 02:42:08.040
<v Speaker 1>Mentally they're spent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3631
02:42:08.370 --> 02:42:11.070
<v Speaker 1>So Mel knows that with their strength </v>
<v Speaker 1>and conditioning coach,</v>

3632
02:42:11.550 --> 02:42:12.630
<v Speaker 1>she knows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

3633
02:42:12.690 --> 02:42:15.720
<v Speaker 1>I let her know we need to pull back or </v>
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

3634
02:42:15.721 --> 02:42:20.721
<v Speaker 1>let's let's push right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the strength and conditioning as </v>

3635
02:42:20.721 --> 02:42:21.360
<v Speaker 1>they're dangerous and sometimes they set</v>
<v Speaker 1>up training scenarios,</v>

3636
02:42:21.361 --> 02:42:24.690
<v Speaker 1>trained to Mimic Emma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In my opinion,</v>

3637
02:42:24.691 --> 02:42:29.691
<v Speaker 1>it's not the right way to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If in the strength room we're trying to </v>

3638
02:42:29.691 --> 02:42:29.691
<v Speaker 1>get strong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

3639
02:42:29.691 --> 02:42:30.930
<v Speaker 1>or if doing speed work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're trying to get fast.</v>

3640
02:42:31.310 --> 02:42:36.310
<v Speaker 1>The pride,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably the best way to do that is to </v>

3641
02:42:36.310 --> 02:42:36.360
<v Speaker 1>squat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do some cleans to get overall strength.</v>

3642
02:42:36.360 --> 02:42:39.710
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to put me in an Ma </v>
<v Speaker 1>position to try to be strong there.</v>

3643
02:42:39.820 --> 02:42:42.360
<v Speaker 1>I already spent five workouts this week </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>

3644
02:42:42.380 --> 02:42:42.970
<v Speaker 1>Amen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3645
02:42:42.990 --> 02:42:44.830
<v Speaker 1>you were telling me before we started </v>
<v Speaker 1>this podcast,</v>

3646
02:42:44.831 --> 02:42:48.090
<v Speaker 1>so you started really incorporating a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of Olympic Olympic lift.</v>

3647
02:42:48.091 --> 02:42:48.930
<v Speaker 1>Olympic lift.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3648
02:42:48.931 --> 02:42:50.940
<v Speaker 1>And that it's actually helped your joint</v>
<v Speaker 1>pain.</v>

3649
02:42:51.060 --> 02:42:54.090
<v Speaker 1>Pat Pat now is shut both of us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No shoulder pain,</v>

3650
02:42:54.290 --> 02:42:56.010
<v Speaker 1>knee pain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no back pain.</v>

3651
02:42:56.400 --> 02:43:00.240
<v Speaker 1>We do a lot of clean squatting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Feels amazing.</v>

3652
02:43:00.300 --> 02:43:03.570
<v Speaker 1>What do you think is why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is that eliminating pain?</v>

3653
02:43:03.571 --> 02:43:08.400
<v Speaker 1>I think because I think it strengthens </v>
<v Speaker 1>your overall body in a different way.</v>

3654
02:43:08.610 --> 02:43:11.480
<v Speaker 1>If you're doing more kind of single </v>
<v Speaker 1>plant type exercise.</v>

3655
02:43:11.550 --> 02:43:12.060
<v Speaker 1>If I'm</v>

3656
02:43:12.070 --> 02:43:14.380
<v Speaker 3>doing a curl or subdue him a particular </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>

3657
02:43:14.620 --> 02:43:16.810
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of stress that happens on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the joint there.</v>

3658
02:43:16.960 --> 02:43:20.610
<v Speaker 3>If you do something like a clean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an explosive motion.</v>

3659
02:43:20.630 --> 02:43:25.630
<v Speaker 3>You're jumping,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're using your whole body from </v>

3660
02:43:25.630 --> 02:43:25.630
<v Speaker 3>shoulders,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're pulling.</v>

3661
02:43:25.630 --> 02:43:25.750
<v Speaker 3>It's very low.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oddly enough,</v>

3662
02:43:25.751 --> 02:43:30.751
<v Speaker 3>it's a very low stress type of movement </v>
<v Speaker 3>that that enables you to get super </v>

3663
02:43:30.751 --> 02:43:34.050
<v Speaker 3>strong without taxing your joints.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a weird movement where everything's</v>

3664
02:43:34.060 --> 02:43:38.410
<v Speaker 3>just super technical explosion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's the whole thing.</v>

3665
02:43:38.411 --> 02:43:41.080
<v Speaker 3>If if I'm there to get stronger,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more explosive.</v>

3666
02:43:41.110 --> 02:43:46.110
<v Speaker 3>If you're running me through a five,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a 25 minute circuit where I'm just kind </v>

3667
02:43:46.110 --> 02:43:48.280
<v Speaker 3>of crossfit style as hard and fast as I </v>
<v Speaker 3>can go.</v>

3668
02:43:48.640 --> 02:43:51.730
<v Speaker 3>We already did that in the inspiring.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We already did that.</v>

3669
02:43:52.000 --> 02:43:53.590
<v Speaker 3>We've done that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do we again,</v>

3670
02:43:53.591 --> 02:43:55.300
<v Speaker 3>why are we doing what we're doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3671
02:43:55.301 --> 02:43:58.480
<v Speaker 3>the why is we need to develop more </v>
<v Speaker 3>explicit hip strength.</v>

3672
02:43:58.690 --> 02:44:02.530
<v Speaker 3>Caitlin had super strong hips but didn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>have any idea how to activate them.</v>

3673
02:44:02.550 --> 02:44:06.340
<v Speaker 3>In my situation I tried all these </v>
<v Speaker 3>different things and what helped get her</v>

3674
02:44:06.341 --> 02:44:10.540
<v Speaker 3>there was a cleans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What about hard sparring?</v>

3675
02:44:10.570 --> 02:44:11.430
<v Speaker 3>What do you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you,</v>

3676
02:44:11.440 --> 02:44:16.440
<v Speaker 3>what are your thoughts on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of fighters that bang it </v>

3677
02:44:16.440 --> 02:44:19.891
<v Speaker 3>out two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>three days a week and other people say </v>

3678
02:44:19.891 --> 02:44:19.891
<v Speaker 3>once a week is plenty good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not only that,</v>

3679
02:44:19.891 --> 02:44:22.300
<v Speaker 3>you probably shouldn't spar up until </v>
<v Speaker 3>like the last few weeks of camp.</v>

3680
02:44:22.301 --> 02:44:25.690
<v Speaker 3>I think less is better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you first have to.</v>

3681
02:44:25.750 --> 02:44:27.820
<v Speaker 3>Like when pat first came out to train </v>
<v Speaker 3>with us,</v>

3682
02:44:28.060 --> 02:44:33.060
<v Speaker 3>there's a guy at king's mma.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He used to train there who was 300 </v>

3683
02:44:33.060 --> 02:44:35.941
<v Speaker 3>pounds and for 200 minutes for me for </v>
<v Speaker 3>two minutes was the toughest guy in the </v>

3684
02:44:35.941 --> 02:44:39.811
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He would do flying knees and head key </v>

3685
02:44:39.811 --> 02:44:39.811
<v Speaker 3>was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For two minutes.</v>

3686
02:44:39.811 --> 02:44:39.811
<v Speaker 3>For two.</v>

3687
02:44:39.811 --> 02:44:42.970
<v Speaker 3>After that he's talking about pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a lot of fucking gas.</v>

3688
02:44:42.971 --> 02:44:44.410
<v Speaker 3>You need to pump too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3689
02:44:44.411 --> 02:44:49.411
<v Speaker 3>so I put them in there with patony lands</v>
<v Speaker 3>at three punch combination and then he </v>

3690
02:44:49.411 --> 02:44:52.860
<v Speaker 3>kicks him in the head and they all ended</v>
<v Speaker 3>up standing next to Rafael Cordeiro and </v>

3691
02:44:52.860 --> 02:44:54.790
<v Speaker 3>Patrick sponsee turns and goes around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a right hand down the middle,</v>

3692
02:44:54.791 --> 02:44:57.010
<v Speaker 3>double exit into the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and Raphael turns to me.</v>

3693
02:44:57.011 --> 02:44:58.990
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I put my stamp on them.</v>

3694
02:44:59.250 --> 02:45:01.780
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because if you're going to do this,</v>

3695
02:45:01.781 --> 02:45:02.650
<v Speaker 3>if you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you say,</v>

3696
02:45:02.651 --> 02:45:07.651
<v Speaker 3>I really want to be a cage fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we got to figure out what's going to </v>

3697
02:45:07.651 --> 02:45:07.870
<v Speaker 3>happen when someone hits you really </v>
<v Speaker 3>hard.</v>

3698
02:45:08.310 --> 02:45:13.310
<v Speaker 3>Have you hit me really hard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm probably going to go hide since I </v>

3699
02:45:13.310 --> 02:45:14.000
<v Speaker 3>got somewhere to be and it's not here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3700
02:45:14.350 --> 02:45:19.350
<v Speaker 3>So you have to figure that out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Once you know that a guy or a girl has </v>

3701
02:45:19.350 --> 02:45:22.531
<v Speaker 3>those natural fighter tendencies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't have to keep finding that out </v>

3702
02:45:22.531 --> 02:45:22.531
<v Speaker 3>three times a week.</v>

3703
02:45:22.780 --> 02:45:24.820
<v Speaker 3>If you're going to go fight for 15 </v>
<v Speaker 3>minutes,</v>

3704
02:45:25.150 --> 02:45:28.630
<v Speaker 3>then we're going to do once a week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll spar for 15 minutes,</v>

3705
02:45:28.631 --> 02:45:29.440
<v Speaker 3>three,</v>
<v Speaker 3>five minute rounds.</v>

3706
02:45:29.441 --> 02:45:32.620
<v Speaker 3>I got that shield train was Saint Pierre</v>
<v Speaker 3>not too long ago in st peers at the same</v>

3707
02:45:32.621 --> 02:45:34.900
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I'm fighting for five rounds,</v>

3708
02:45:34.901 --> 02:45:39.901
<v Speaker 3>I'll spar for five rounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why take that guy I told you about </v>

3709
02:45:39.901 --> 02:45:41.080
<v Speaker 3>before?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He would do these 10 round battles.</v>

3710
02:45:41.081 --> 02:45:43.360
<v Speaker 3>He did that for years and all of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>sudden,</v>

3711
02:45:43.361 --> 02:45:48.361
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fighter a has 200 rounds and you have </v>

3712
02:45:48.361 --> 02:45:51.190
<v Speaker 3>2000 rounds on you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You only have a limited amount that your</v>

3713
02:45:51.191 --> 02:45:53.950
<v Speaker 3>body's gonna withstand before things </v>
<v Speaker 3>start going wrong.</v>

3714
02:45:53.980 --> 02:45:57.000
<v Speaker 3>What about light sparring?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Technical sparring.</v>

3715
02:45:57.160 --> 02:45:59.230
<v Speaker 3>I think it's good as long as it's not </v>
<v Speaker 3>slow.</v>

3716
02:45:59.231 --> 02:46:04.231
<v Speaker 3>The problem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a tactical sparring is that they play </v>

3717
02:46:04.231 --> 02:46:07.590
<v Speaker 3>this lowe's lazy slow game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think having control is really </v>

3718
02:46:07.590 --> 02:46:07.930
<v Speaker 3>important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're switching up.</v>

3719
02:46:08.050 --> 02:46:10.490
<v Speaker 3>We're doing two more studies now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kind of back to these gloves.</v>

3720
02:46:10.550 --> 02:46:14.060
<v Speaker 3>Figuring out if I'm sparring,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I'm fighting in an MMA fight,</v>

3721
02:46:14.061 --> 02:46:19.061
<v Speaker 3>I have little gloves on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I do all my sparring and 16 ounce </v>

3722
02:46:19.061 --> 02:46:21.731
<v Speaker 3>gloves visually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm standing behind 32 ounce of </v>

3723
02:46:21.731 --> 02:46:22.190
<v Speaker 3>material.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It looks and feels different.</v>

3724
02:46:22.370 --> 02:46:27.370
<v Speaker 3>It's much bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 3>much easier to protect yourself with </v>

3725
02:46:27.370 --> 02:46:28.810
<v Speaker 3>those k one style guys that put.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They put the earmuffs on medium,</v>

3726
02:46:28.820 --> 02:46:30.710
<v Speaker 3>they put their gloves up next to their </v>
<v Speaker 3>ear,</v>

3727
02:46:30.890 --> 02:46:32.860
<v Speaker 3>and that's the style of defense they </v>
<v Speaker 3>use.</v>

3728
02:46:32.861 --> 02:46:37.861
<v Speaker 3>They go into this shell does not work in</v>
<v Speaker 3>an MMA because punches go around those </v>

3729
02:46:37.861 --> 02:46:39.260
<v Speaker 3>gloves around them so your defense </v>
<v Speaker 3>changes.</v>

3730
02:46:39.890 --> 02:46:44.890
<v Speaker 3>There's more I can throw a bad punch </v>
<v Speaker 3>with a 16 ounce gloves on that I can't </v>

3731
02:46:44.890 --> 02:46:48.620
<v Speaker 3>get away with in a four ounce gloves or </v>
<v Speaker 3>bare knuckled or bare knuckle did.</v>

3732
02:46:48.640 --> 02:46:53.640
<v Speaker 3>The whole strategy is different,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so if you spend all your time hitting </v>

3733
02:46:53.640 --> 02:46:54.410
<v Speaker 3>mitts with big gloves on sparring with </v>
<v Speaker 3>big gloves on,</v>

3734
02:46:54.411 --> 02:46:57.350
<v Speaker 3>when you get into a cage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something's going to going to be off.</v>

3735
02:46:57.620 --> 02:47:00.290
<v Speaker 3>Those things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could hit mits as hard as you can.</v>

3736
02:47:00.350 --> 02:47:02.210
<v Speaker 3>The hardest pair of Mitts with those </v>
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>

3737
02:47:02.390 --> 02:47:04.000
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to have any hand pain </v>
<v Speaker 3>with them.</v>

3738
02:47:04.360 --> 02:47:06.380
<v Speaker 3>What we're exploring next,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're doing two studies.</v>

3739
02:47:06.381 --> 02:47:11.381
<v Speaker 3>Next first is what part does grip </v>
<v Speaker 3>strength play in punching power and the </v>

3740
02:47:11.381 --> 02:47:16.211
<v Speaker 3>next one is what's safer?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are these gloves safer than 16 ounce </v>

3741
02:47:16.791 --> 02:47:18.350
<v Speaker 3>gloves or a 16 ounce gloves?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Safer?</v>

3742
02:47:18.351 --> 02:47:19.850
<v Speaker 3>Because if you look at the amount of </v>
<v Speaker 3>padding,</v>

3743
02:47:20.300 --> 02:47:23.030
<v Speaker 3>a 16 ounce gloves doesn't have any more </v>
<v Speaker 3>padding this way.</v>

3744
02:47:23.780 --> 02:47:26.750
<v Speaker 3>We also have this bar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this foam pad built in there,</v>

3745
02:47:26.751 --> 02:47:29.060
<v Speaker 3>so it spreads the area out over a wide </v>
<v Speaker 3>area,</v>

3746
02:47:29.100 --> 02:47:32.780
<v Speaker 3>making it safer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The wider the area that an impact Lens,</v>

3747
02:47:32.781 --> 02:47:34.730
<v Speaker 3>a safer it's gonna be for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it does that.</v>

3748
02:47:34.970 --> 02:47:38.360
<v Speaker 3>A lot of a 16 ounce gloves in the thumb.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's in the back portion of.</v>

3749
02:47:38.370 --> 02:47:39.510
<v Speaker 3>It's in the risks that we are.</v>

3750
02:47:39.710 --> 02:47:42.730
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't have any idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went to Nova and yeah,</v>

3751
02:47:42.731 --> 02:47:47.731
<v Speaker 3>once and I was shocked to see them all </v>
<v Speaker 3>sparring pretty hard with little gloves </v>

3752
02:47:47.731 --> 02:47:49.970
<v Speaker 3>on and I look at how accurate joe say </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll do is with this punches.</v>

3753
02:47:50.270 --> 02:47:55.270
<v Speaker 3>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this will be a game changer in how guys </v>

3754
02:47:55.270 --> 02:47:55.270
<v Speaker 3>are training and preparing for Emma.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Emma,</v>

3755
02:47:55.270 --> 02:47:59.201
<v Speaker 3>I think you should be sparring and this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you should be hitting mitts in </v>

3756
02:47:59.201 --> 02:48:01.661
<v Speaker 3>them as much as you can do in a glove </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's going to simulate your </v>

3757
02:48:01.661 --> 02:48:01.760
<v Speaker 3>competition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The better off you're going to be.</v>

3758
02:48:01.770 --> 02:48:04.310
<v Speaker 3>And I have a theory that we haven't </v>
<v Speaker 3>tested yet.</v>

3759
02:48:04.340 --> 02:48:07.100
<v Speaker 3>These are actually safer than than </v>
<v Speaker 3>boxing gloves.</v>

3760
02:48:07.160 --> 02:48:08.640
<v Speaker 3>Spar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're gonna.</v>

3761
02:48:08.660 --> 02:48:11.000
<v Speaker 3>Find out because there's less mass </v>
<v Speaker 3>coming at you.</v>

3762
02:48:11.800 --> 02:48:13.470
<v Speaker 3>If you look at the quiz,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a physics equation,</v>

3763
02:48:13.490 --> 02:48:18.490
<v Speaker 3>the force of something equals the mass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How big it is times acceleration or how </v>

3764
02:48:18.490 --> 02:48:18.490
<v Speaker 3>fast it's moving.</v>

3765
02:48:18.490 --> 02:48:23.260
<v Speaker 3>This is smaller mass,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so if it's moving the same speed as the </v>

3766
02:48:23.260 --> 02:48:24.620
<v Speaker 3>16 ounce glove,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the force will be less because it's less</v>

3767
02:48:24.920 --> 02:48:27.710
<v Speaker 3>mass coming at you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The quick two questions arise,</v>

3768
02:48:27.711 --> 02:48:29.510
<v Speaker 3>one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's smaller,</v>

3769
02:48:29.570 --> 02:48:32.480
<v Speaker 3>can you punch faster?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the second is,</v>

3770
02:48:32.630 --> 02:48:33.590
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pressure.</v>

3771
02:48:33.890 --> 02:48:38.090
<v Speaker 3>How much of the impact areas landing </v>
<v Speaker 3>this bar spreads the pressure out over a</v>

3772
02:48:38.091 --> 02:48:40.070
<v Speaker 3>wider area.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to make punching safer,</v>

3773
02:48:40.700 --> 02:48:42.440
<v Speaker 3>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to go test this in the lab.</v>

3774
02:48:42.441 --> 02:48:43.700
<v Speaker 3>We're going to find no one's ever done </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

3775
02:48:43.990 --> 02:48:48.990
<v Speaker 3>Everyone is everyone who's ever started </v>
<v Speaker 3>glove company called the same companies </v>

3776
02:48:48.990 --> 02:48:52.520
<v Speaker 3>in Pakistan or China and they did a </v>
<v Speaker 3>glove and they put a fancy logo on it </v>

3777
02:48:52.520 --> 02:48:52.520
<v Speaker 3>and they said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>

3778
02:48:52.520 --> 02:48:54.860
<v Speaker 3>here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the first time in the history of</v>

3779
02:48:54.861 --> 02:48:57.440
<v Speaker 3>combat sports.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyone's ever taken an idea and went,</v>

3780
02:48:57.770 --> 02:48:58.790
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think this works.</v>

3781
02:48:58.910 --> 02:49:03.910
<v Speaker 3>Let's go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To a real sport science lab at a real </v>

3782
02:49:03.910 --> 02:49:03.910
<v Speaker 3>university,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do a real study and get real results and</v>

3783
02:49:03.910 --> 02:49:08.231
<v Speaker 3>see if we're right and let's calculate </v>
<v Speaker 3>all the different numbers and does find </v>

3784
02:49:08.231 --> 02:49:08.250
<v Speaker 3>finding larger</v>

3785
02:49:08.250 --> 02:49:09.630
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>smaller people,</v>

3786
02:49:09.631 --> 02:49:10.800
<v Speaker 2>women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>men,</v>

3787
02:49:10.950 --> 02:49:13.530
<v Speaker 2>guys like Carwyn with big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>giant hands,</v>

3788
02:49:13.710 --> 02:49:17.470
<v Speaker 2>which is always a a big factor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like George Foreman's hands,</v>

3789
02:49:17.640 --> 02:49:21.390
<v Speaker 2>George Foreman's hands,</v>
<v Speaker 2>remember equal Hams,</v>

3790
02:49:21.660 --> 02:49:23.430
<v Speaker 2>Hams,</v>
<v Speaker 2>same thing.</v>

3791
02:49:23.950 --> 02:49:26.340
<v Speaker 2>Then that's a massive thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3792
02:49:26.490 --> 02:49:31.490
<v Speaker 2>Having that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like the difference between having </v>

3793
02:49:31.490 --> 02:49:31.490
<v Speaker 2>a carpenter's finish hammer and having a</v>
<v Speaker 2>sledge hammer.</v>

3794
02:49:31.490 --> 02:49:34.980
<v Speaker 2>This amount of mass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you'd look at car wins hands.</v>

3795
02:49:34.981 --> 02:49:38.100
<v Speaker 2>Like I shook hands with Corwin's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like shaking hands with a laptop.</v>

3796
02:49:38.310 --> 02:49:43.310
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is this big giant thing that</v>
<v Speaker 2>grips ahold of your fucking hand and </v>

3797
02:49:43.310 --> 02:49:45.870
<v Speaker 2>that's why when carwyn would hit people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when he hit Gonzaga,</v>

3798
02:49:46.040 --> 02:49:51.040
<v Speaker 2>he knocked out Gonzaga.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he hit Gonzaga with like a sixth </v>

3799
02:49:51.040 --> 02:49:54.121
<v Speaker 2>sense punch that just shut the lights </v>
<v Speaker 2>out and it's because he's just got so </v>

3800
02:49:54.121 --> 02:49:55.110
<v Speaker 2>much bass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's so much there.</v>

3801
02:49:55.111 --> 02:49:58.260
<v Speaker 2>There's so there's just a different sort</v>
<v Speaker 2>of weapon.</v>

3802
02:49:58.330 --> 02:50:01.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That a person who has smaller hands,</v>

3803
02:50:01.080 --> 02:50:06.080
<v Speaker 2>like a floyd mayweather is a guy who </v>
<v Speaker 2>really could benefit from this </v>

3804
02:50:06.080 --> 02:50:06.780
<v Speaker 2>technology too because he's always </v>
<v Speaker 2>breaking his hands.</v>

3805
02:50:06.990 --> 02:50:09.330
<v Speaker 2>Floyd's had a bunch of handbrakes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Vito Vito.</v>

3806
02:50:09.440 --> 02:50:13.950
<v Speaker 2>I was like a size nine foot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is not have big hands or big feet.</v>

3807
02:50:13.951 --> 02:50:18.951
<v Speaker 2>He's not like a big bone guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like a car when or like [inaudible] </v>

3808
02:50:18.951 --> 02:50:19.920
<v Speaker 2>Lesnar dcs is this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does he really?</v>

3809
02:50:20.010 --> 02:50:21.480
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because he's had and issues.</v>

3810
02:50:21.481 --> 02:50:22.020
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>

3811
02:50:22.021 --> 02:50:24.690
<v Speaker 3>try this out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To say that he broke his hand a bunch.</v>

3812
02:50:25.080 --> 02:50:30.080
<v Speaker 3>So here's another thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'd go back to the psychology of </v>

3813
02:50:30.080 --> 02:50:30.090
<v Speaker 3>trading.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you've broken your hands seven times,</v>

3814
02:50:30.790 --> 02:50:34.590
<v Speaker 3>all of a sudden you're back to training </v>
<v Speaker 3>again and then you put the little gloves</v>

3815
02:50:34.591 --> 02:50:35.970
<v Speaker 3>on and inherently,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

3816
02:50:37.590 --> 02:50:39.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's almost most most impressive about</v>

3817
02:50:39.730 --> 02:50:43.950
<v Speaker 2>detour is that the guy makes his debut </v>
<v Speaker 2>in [inaudible] 97 at UFC 12.</v>

3818
02:50:44.250 --> 02:50:47.330
<v Speaker 2>Here is you have see what is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is he fighting?</v>

3819
02:50:47.560 --> 02:50:49.830
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] was going to fight for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>title.</v>

3820
02:50:50.070 --> 02:50:52.860
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ban Use soil.</v>

3821
02:50:52.920 --> 02:50:54.660
<v Speaker 2>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>16 years.</v>

3822
02:50:54.690 --> 02:50:58.650
<v Speaker 2>He's the only guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only guy out of all those years.</v>

3823
02:50:58.860 --> 02:51:03.860
<v Speaker 2>Besides Dan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean he's sort of kind of </v>

3824
02:51:03.860 --> 02:51:05.190
<v Speaker 2>eliminated Dan from that running with </v>
<v Speaker 2>his last victory over Dan.</v>

3825
02:51:05.400 --> 02:51:09.000
<v Speaker 2>I mean Dan did he knock out shogun in </v>
<v Speaker 2>his subsequent fight,</v>

3826
02:51:09.001 --> 02:51:11.490
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shoguns not the same anymore either.</v>

3827
02:51:11.491 --> 02:51:14.160
<v Speaker 2>And shogun had Dan hurt just stand so </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking tough.</v>

3828
02:51:14.610 --> 02:51:15.360
<v Speaker 2>He's just so much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3829
02:51:16.680 --> 02:51:18.280
<v Speaker 3>so fucking for a year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She,</v>

3830
02:51:18.320 --> 02:51:21.730
<v Speaker 3>I never scored a point on him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Come on,</v>

3831
02:51:21.790 --> 02:51:24.040
<v Speaker 3>give me one tick that one time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3832
02:51:24.950 --> 02:51:26.860
<v Speaker 3>I've never gotten a good position on </v>
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>

3833
02:51:27.880 --> 02:51:30.040
<v Speaker 3>He always had that stupid power.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

3834
02:51:30.041 --> 02:51:33.440
<v Speaker 3>People knew there's video of data.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know where it is of interest.</v>

3835
02:51:33.441 --> 02:51:36.400
<v Speaker 3>Yelling match.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is probably in the 19 [inaudible].</v>

3836
02:51:36.401 --> 02:51:41.401
<v Speaker 3>He throws a headlock on the guy in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrestling match and knocks the guy out </v>

3837
02:51:41.401 --> 02:51:41.401
<v Speaker 3>with the headlock.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That guy gets up,</v>

3838
02:51:41.401 --> 02:51:43.960
<v Speaker 3>takes a minute and he's so dizzy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He falls back down again.</v>

3839
02:51:44.230 --> 02:51:46.810
<v Speaker 3>Didn't head locked him right in the neck</v>
<v Speaker 3>while people knew.</v>

3840
02:51:46.811 --> 02:51:49.840
<v Speaker 3>If you're a power guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll people will find out in the first</v>

3841
02:51:49.841 --> 02:51:52.760
<v Speaker 3>week of training right away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People at team quest when.</v>

3842
02:51:52.761 --> 02:51:54.250
<v Speaker 3>Oh Dan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh boy.</v>

3843
02:51:54.490 --> 02:51:55.390
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right away,</v>

3844
02:51:55.450 --> 02:51:58.010
<v Speaker 3>but he couldn't kick that hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These flexible flexibility.</v>

3845
02:51:58.020 --> 02:51:59.140
<v Speaker 3>His hips,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hamstrings,</v>

3846
02:52:00.950 --> 02:52:01.810
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's funny.</v>

3847
02:52:01.811 --> 02:52:04.690
<v Speaker 3>His Dad is so inflexible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't really bend his fingers back.</v>

3848
02:52:04.810 --> 02:52:05.170
<v Speaker 3>Dan's</v>

3849
02:52:06.930 --> 02:52:07.990
<v Speaker 1>Kevin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his fingers,</v>

3850
02:52:08.010 --> 02:52:09.930
<v Speaker 1>not his dad was always like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't go.</v>

3851
02:52:09.940 --> 02:52:14.940
<v Speaker 1>He couldn't come to this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you look at Danny that dense </v>

3852
02:52:14.940 --> 02:52:18.481
<v Speaker 1>musculature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no way you can get a guy like </v>

3853
02:52:18.481 --> 02:52:18.481
<v Speaker 1>that to have flexible hips.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the air thing,</v>

3854
02:52:18.481 --> 02:52:19.420
<v Speaker 1>hips,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her anatomy to.</v>

3855
02:52:19.710 --> 02:52:21.130
<v Speaker 1>I go back to gymnastics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3856
02:52:21.730 --> 02:52:26.730
<v Speaker 1>There's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The the location and the angle of your </v>

3857
02:52:26.730 --> 02:52:28.690
<v Speaker 1>hip joints will allow you to either be </v>
<v Speaker 1>flexible or not.</v>

3858
02:52:28.691 --> 02:52:33.691
<v Speaker 1>Same with your shoulders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in gymnastics they check this very </v>

3859
02:52:33.691 --> 02:52:37.591
<v Speaker 1>quick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Orange County has probably some of </v>

3860
02:52:37.591 --> 02:52:38.740
<v Speaker 1>the best gymnastics in the whole country</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the last five Olympic girls were from</v>

3861
02:52:38.741 --> 02:52:40.360
<v Speaker 1>Orange County.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's.</v>

3862
02:52:40.361 --> 02:52:45.361
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's super high quality gyms with </v>

3863
02:52:45.361 --> 02:52:45.361
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to become an Olympic gymnast,</v>

3864
02:52:45.361 --> 02:52:46.750
<v Speaker 1>there's so many things it has to have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's like being a runway model.</v>

3865
02:52:46.751 --> 02:52:49.450
<v Speaker 1>You have to have this certain genetics </v>
<v Speaker 1>or no matter what you do,</v>

3866
02:52:49.451 --> 02:52:50.170
<v Speaker 1>you can't make it.</v>

3867
02:52:50.530 --> 02:52:53.860
<v Speaker 1>If your hip joints are naturally like </v>
<v Speaker 1>this and they need to be like this,</v>

3868
02:52:53.861 --> 02:52:58.861
<v Speaker 1>you can hear what you're doing with your</v>
<v Speaker 1>hands where people are not just the </v>

3869
02:52:58.861 --> 02:52:58.861
<v Speaker 1>angle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you look at your hips,</v>

3870
02:52:58.861 --> 02:53:03.181
<v Speaker 1>there's an angle that they come off of </v>
<v Speaker 1>depending on how your genetic anatomy </v>

3871
02:53:03.461 --> 02:53:05.770
<v Speaker 1>turned out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's one way or the other.</v>

3872
02:53:06.100 --> 02:53:11.100
<v Speaker 1>My daughter has hips that she can do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She could do a split on this line and </v>

3873
02:53:11.100 --> 02:53:11.100
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3874
02:53:11.100 --> 02:53:11.870
<v Speaker 1>she's a little girl and she's been </v>
<v Speaker 1>practicing some.</v>

3875
02:53:12.040 --> 02:53:13.450
<v Speaker 1>Some little girls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can't ever do it.</v>

3876
02:53:14.010 --> 02:53:16.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If your hip joints are here,</v>

3877
02:53:16.960 --> 02:53:19.780
<v Speaker 1>the bony anatomy won't let them come all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way off.</v>

3878
02:53:19.980 --> 02:53:21.370
<v Speaker 1>Is that scientific?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I've been.</v>

3879
02:53:21.500 --> 02:53:24.250
<v Speaker 1>You can love people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've taken people that have that.</v>

3880
02:53:24.490 --> 02:53:29.490
<v Speaker 1>You can look at them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do show that their flexibility </v>

3881
02:53:29.490 --> 02:53:29.490
<v Speaker 1>flexibilities absolutely limited for </v>
<v Speaker 1>sure,</v>

3882
02:53:29.490 --> 02:53:29.850
<v Speaker 1>and you'll see it in shoulders too </v>
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

3883
02:53:29.850 --> 02:53:30.880
<v Speaker 1>They'll say immediately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3884
02:53:30.881 --> 02:53:31.930
<v Speaker 1>that girl is tight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shoulders.</v>

3885
02:53:32.050 --> 02:53:37.050
<v Speaker 1>Can she get it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The gymnast are the ones who figure it </v>

3886
02:53:37.050 --> 02:53:37.270
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We also train gymnastics too,</v>

3887
02:53:37.271 --> 02:53:39.100
<v Speaker 1>so it's a fascinating sport in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>

3888
02:53:39.130 --> 02:53:41.910
<v Speaker 1>You trained gymnastics people at rain?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3889
02:53:41.930 --> 02:53:42.520
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we.</v>

3890
02:53:42.610 --> 02:53:46.360
<v Speaker 1>We go to a gym train in gymnastics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen patent do that.</v>

3891
02:53:46.390 --> 02:53:48.860
<v Speaker 1>Is that because of your daughter and </v>
<v Speaker 1>your connection?</v>

3892
02:53:49.240 --> 02:53:52.390
<v Speaker 1>We met her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was Arco Art gymnastics coach.</v>

3893
02:53:52.391 --> 02:53:55.180
<v Speaker 1>I have an Exec at a gym called scats in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Huntington Beach.</v>

3894
02:53:55.570 --> 02:54:00.570
<v Speaker 1>He was my daughter's coach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He left the gym and we just started </v>

3895
02:54:00.570 --> 02:54:00.970
<v Speaker 1>training with Ivan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No shift.</v>

3896
02:54:01.100 --> 02:54:06.100
<v Speaker 1>So what is the benefit of gymnastic </v>
<v Speaker 1>training for something if you want to </v>

3897
02:54:06.100 --> 02:54:07.120
<v Speaker 1>ever want to feel weak and </v>
<v Speaker 1>uncoordinated,</v>

3898
02:54:07.121 --> 02:54:12.121
<v Speaker 1>come do some gymnastics with us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know George got really into </v>

3899
02:54:12.121 --> 02:54:12.121
<v Speaker 1>gymnastics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

3900
02:54:12.121 --> 02:54:15.040
<v Speaker 1>you get super strong in the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>functional way possible.</v>

3901
02:54:15.070 --> 02:54:17.560
<v Speaker 1>I mean looking at Olympic gym does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want to see someone crazy,</v>

3902
02:54:17.800 --> 02:54:22.800
<v Speaker 1>the number one gymnast in the world or </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a female gymnast is a girl named </v>

3903
02:54:22.800 --> 02:54:23.410
<v Speaker 1>Simone biles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Simone biles.</v>

3904
02:54:23.411 --> 02:54:24.790
<v Speaker 1>She just won the world championship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

3905
02:54:24.791 --> 02:54:27.550
<v Speaker 1>if you watch her floor routine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your mouth would fall open.</v>

3906
02:54:27.551 --> 02:54:31.960
<v Speaker 1>She's got got King Mo musculature and </v>
<v Speaker 1>she's five foot nine is incredible as an</v>

3907
02:54:31.961 --> 02:54:35.200
<v Speaker 1>athlete can be to make it to that level </v>
<v Speaker 1>in gymnastics.</v>

3908
02:54:35.650 --> 02:54:38.740
<v Speaker 1>All these things that have to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the genetics have to be there first.</v>

3909
02:54:38.930 --> 02:54:41.680
<v Speaker 1>Then you have to get super,</v>
<v Speaker 1>super ballsy to do high level.</v>

3910
02:54:41.681 --> 02:54:46.681
<v Speaker 1>Gymnastics is a level of bravery that </v>
<v Speaker 1>most people will never really fully </v>

3911
02:54:46.681 --> 02:54:48.700
<v Speaker 1>flipping through the air and shit and </v>
<v Speaker 1>hoping you don't land on your feet.</v>

3912
02:54:48.701 --> 02:54:50.630
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's controls the girl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3913
02:54:50.650 --> 02:54:52.180
<v Speaker 1>Look at her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

3914
02:54:52.181 --> 02:54:54.280
<v Speaker 1>But what she does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to lay this.</v>

3915
02:54:55.240 --> 02:54:57.440
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She doesn't even look real.</v>

3916
02:54:57.550 --> 02:54:58.630
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she does.</v>

3917
02:54:58.631 --> 02:55:01.000
<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

3918
02:55:01.001 --> 02:55:03.610
<v Speaker 1>Simone Biles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she does last name [inaudible].</v>

3919
02:55:03.650 --> 02:55:06.220
<v Speaker 1>It's B l e s.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

3920
02:55:06.440 --> 02:55:08.750
<v Speaker 1>And I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at this.</v>

3921
02:55:08.840 --> 02:55:11.060
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These flips are insane.</v>

3922
02:55:11.061 --> 02:55:12.740
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She planted.</v>

3923
02:55:13.730 --> 02:55:15.800
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's incredible.</v>

3924
02:55:15.890 --> 02:55:18.320
<v Speaker 1>This to me is the greatest athlete I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever seen.</v>

3925
02:55:18.800 --> 02:55:21.410
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3926
02:55:21.411 --> 02:55:23.150
<v Speaker 1>If you could teach that checks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm Emma.</v>

3927
02:55:23.270 --> 02:55:26.090
<v Speaker 1>You imagine what you would do two checks</v>
<v Speaker 1>while she was on it for nine,</v>

3928
02:55:26.091 --> 02:55:27.650
<v Speaker 1>so no reason ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hundred,</v>

3929
02:55:27.651 --> 02:55:28.970
<v Speaker 1>15 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's good.</v>

3930
02:55:29.180 --> 02:55:34.180
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the gymnastics training was w it </v>

3931
02:55:34.180 --> 02:55:36.260
<v Speaker 1>develops your ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's probably 90 pounds for nine,</v>

3932
02:55:37.040 --> 02:55:40.700
<v Speaker 1>so we needed something below strawweight</v>
<v Speaker 1>for women.</v>

3933
02:55:40.701 --> 02:55:45.701
<v Speaker 1>That's probably a good idea anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of women that are a </v>

3934
02:55:45.701 --> 02:55:45.701
<v Speaker 1>hundred pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's four nine.</v>

3935
02:55:45.701 --> 02:55:46.250
<v Speaker 1>And how old is she?</v>
<v Speaker 1>17.</v>

3936
02:55:46.340 --> 02:55:51.230
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ fucking flips.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>

3937
02:55:51.740 --> 02:55:53.810
<v Speaker 1>The way she sticks it is incredible.</v>

3938
02:55:54.380 --> 02:55:56.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so w we started doing gymnastics because</v>

3939
02:55:56.661 --> 02:56:01.661
<v Speaker 1>it gives you a body centered awareness </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can't get anywhere else and it </v>

3940
02:56:02.200 --> 02:56:05.750
<v Speaker 1>requires so much strength and how do you</v>
<v Speaker 1>stop?</v>

3941
02:56:05.751 --> 02:56:08.930
<v Speaker 1>How do you do it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like with the MMA training,</v>

3942
02:56:09.290 --> 02:56:13.070
<v Speaker 1>the first thing we had to figure out was</v>
<v Speaker 1>what can you do and what can't you do?</v>

3943
02:56:13.130 --> 02:56:18.130
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because when we first started going </v>

3944
02:56:18.130 --> 02:56:18.130
<v Speaker 1>there that we did some things and I had </v>
<v Speaker 1>a shoulder injury that it's like,</v>

3945
02:56:18.130 --> 02:56:18.980
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can't do that.</v>

3946
02:56:19.060 --> 02:56:24.060
<v Speaker 1>You are not a young girl or young kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You had a shoulder injury from </v>

3947
02:56:24.060 --> 02:56:24.060
<v Speaker 1>gymnastics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3948
02:56:24.060 --> 02:56:26.630
<v Speaker 1>We've got so excited.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just started to do some stuff that we</v>

3949
02:56:26.631 --> 02:56:31.631
<v Speaker 1>didn't know was stuff we were doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We tried to vault and the act of </v>

3950
02:56:32.601 --> 02:56:34.970
<v Speaker 1>blocking on the vault,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we initially thought would be good</v>

3951
02:56:34.971 --> 02:56:37.760
<v Speaker 1>for throwing punches and snapping my </v>
<v Speaker 1>shoulder.</v>

3952
02:56:38.300 --> 02:56:39.700
<v Speaker 1>We're not having that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3953
02:56:40.130 --> 02:56:41.930
<v Speaker 1>So we do a lot of work on the parallel </v>
<v Speaker 1>bars,</v>

3954
02:56:41.931 --> 02:56:46.931
<v Speaker 1>a lot of work doing gymnastics as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got to get my.</v>

3955
02:56:47.860 --> 02:56:49.370
<v Speaker 1>Get my work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you do a flip?</v>

3956
02:56:49.700 --> 02:56:50.810
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can do a flip.</v>

3957
02:56:50.811 --> 02:56:52.970
<v Speaker 1>Like standing on the ultimate fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's on tape.</v>

3958
02:56:53.030 --> 02:56:54.770
<v Speaker 1>But did you not do that before you </v>
<v Speaker 1>start?</v>

3959
02:56:55.340 --> 02:56:57.500
<v Speaker 1>I did gymnastics as a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you really?</v>

3960
02:56:57.650 --> 02:56:59.160
<v Speaker 1>First Sport was ski jumping,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seconds,</v>

3961

<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

3997
02:58:20.340 --> 02:58:23.010
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine that comes into play a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot.</v>

3998
02:58:23.070 --> 02:58:28.070
<v Speaker 1>The number one male,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a gymnast in the world is at that gym </v>

3999
02:58:28.070 --> 02:58:31.750
<v Speaker 1>that that was his home gym.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's now at like Michigan state or </v>

4000
02:58:31.750 --> 02:58:34.701
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we went and watched him and his </v>

4001
02:58:34.701 --> 02:58:36.670
<v Speaker 1>teammate workout esmail did gymnastics </v>
<v Speaker 1>right in front of you was a crazy </v>

4002
02:58:36.670 --> 02:58:41.511
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I see one of them doing as a ring </v>

4003
02:58:41.511 --> 02:58:41.511
<v Speaker 1>routine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you've ever seen a top ring,</v>

4004
02:58:41.511 --> 02:58:43.080
<v Speaker 1>Richard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and right now it just looks in rain.</v>

4005
02:58:43.081 --> 02:58:45.540
<v Speaker 1>Guards are giant to the ridiculous arms.</v>

4006
02:58:45.780 --> 02:58:47.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're all huge,</v>

4007
02:58:47.161 --> 02:58:48.500
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he does this ring routine.</v>

4008
02:58:48.540 --> 02:58:53.540
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens if you take a month off </v>

4009
02:58:53.540 --> 02:58:53.540
<v Speaker 1>because I can't do any of that a month </v>
<v Speaker 1>ago,</v>

4010
02:58:53.540 --> 02:58:53.580
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're kidding.</v>

4011
02:58:53.581 --> 02:58:54.150
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

4012
02:58:54.510 --> 02:58:57.630
<v Speaker 1>So they have to continually do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>continue to do so.</v>

4013
02:58:57.631 --> 02:59:02.631
<v Speaker 1>We go do gymnastics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever progress we feel that we're </v>

4014
02:59:02.631 --> 02:59:02.631
<v Speaker 1>making,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would take a week,</v>

4015
02:59:02.631 --> 02:59:03.070
<v Speaker 1>a week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all gone.</v>

4016
02:59:03.100 --> 02:59:08.100
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing because it's such an </v>
<v Speaker 1>unnatural thing to be swinging like a </v>

4017
02:59:08.100 --> 02:59:08.490
<v Speaker 1>chimp on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the rings.</v>

4018
02:59:08.520 --> 02:59:13.520
<v Speaker 1>He just have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a level of strength and body </v>

4019
02:59:13.520 --> 02:59:16.161
<v Speaker 1>control that exists in no other sport </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's all about this perfection in </v>

4020
02:59:16.161 --> 02:59:18.720
<v Speaker 1>perfect form and perfect movement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fun.</v>

4021
02:59:19.590 --> 02:59:21.590
<v Speaker 1>Do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you concerned at all to doing that?</v>

4022
02:59:21.600 --> 02:59:24.810
