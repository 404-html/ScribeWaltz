<v Speaker 2>Thanks for coming on.</v>

77
00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.990
<v Speaker 2>The one of the cool things about the</v>
<v Speaker 2>internet is that you can get connected</v>

78
00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:02.680
<v Speaker 2>to all these weird and unusual folks and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can also exchange a lot of</v>

79
00:04:02.841 --> 00:04:06.140
<v Speaker 2>information back and forth and find out</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of things about each other.</v>

80
00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:07.393
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

81
00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:09.290
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I read about,</v>

82
00:04:09.291 --> 00:04:11.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing's coming.</v>

83
00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.870
<v Speaker 2>This is fun friendly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I read about you and uh,</v>

84
00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.710
<v Speaker 2>I read some of the things that I didn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

85
00:04:15.711 --> 00:04:17.750
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you had contacted me that you had</v>

86
00:04:17.751 --> 00:04:20.660
<v Speaker 2>included me in your.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many celebrities were there?</v>

87
00:04:20.661 --> 00:04:22.220
<v Speaker 2>Eight or 10.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a top 10.</v>

88
00:04:22.221 --> 00:04:25.750
<v Speaker 2>Most wanted celebrities promoting</v>
<v Speaker 2>harmful pseudo science.</v>

89
00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:30.380
<v Speaker 2>And in that I read about myself and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>was shocked to learn that I believe that</v>

90
00:04:30.381 --> 00:04:32.420
<v Speaker 2>nine slash 11 was created by the</v>
<v Speaker 2>government.</v>

91
00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:35.570
<v Speaker 2>I did not know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know that.</v>

92
00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:37.790
<v Speaker 2>I believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you've ever said that.</v>

93
00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.310
<v Speaker 2>I've never said that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can talk about the whole genesis of</v>

94
00:04:40.311 --> 00:04:41.780
<v Speaker 2>how this list came to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

95
00:04:41.781 --> 00:04:44.030
<v Speaker 2>that's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that one is poorly researched.</v>

96
00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.330
<v Speaker 2>I've absolutely never said that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that the government engineered</v>

97
00:04:47.331 --> 00:04:48.320
<v Speaker 2>nine slash 11.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

98
00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:53.480
<v Speaker 2>this was an episode I did in 2008,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was five,</v>

99
00:04:53.481 --> 00:04:56.750
<v Speaker 2>six years ago now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so before coming here today,</v>

100
00:04:56.751 --> 00:04:59.630
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to make sure and get all my</v>
<v Speaker 2>sources for all of these and</v>

101
00:04:59.631 --> 00:05:04.070
<v Speaker 2>unfortunately back in 2008,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was not yet keeping very good records</v>

102
00:05:04.071 --> 00:05:07.040
<v Speaker 2>and saving my notes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for the things that I have listed</v>

103
00:05:07.041 --> 00:05:08.720
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unfortunately I can't give you the</v>

104
00:05:08.721 --> 00:05:11.900
<v Speaker 2>source for any one of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but any one of them you want to tell him</v>

105
00:05:11.901 --> 00:05:13.930
<v Speaker 2>he is not true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will happily retract it.</v>

106
00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:15.110
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

107
00:05:15.111 --> 00:05:16.580
<v Speaker 2>the nine slash 11 one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>100 percent.</v>

108
00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:19.640
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was on the phone with Alex Jones the</v>

109
00:05:19.641 --> 00:05:24.550
<v Speaker 2>night that nine slash 11 happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The government engineer this documents,</v>

110
00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.710
<v Speaker 2>they've been planning this since</v>
<v Speaker 2>operation northwoods.</v>

111
00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.140
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure it didn't take him until that</v>
<v Speaker 2>night to figure it out.</v>

112
00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:31.720
<v Speaker 2>He would probably.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I think he,</v>

113
00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:34.220
<v Speaker 2>he actually might have even predicted</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

114
00:05:34.221 --> 00:05:36.200
<v Speaker 2>but when you say that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like people go,</v>

115
00:05:36.201 --> 00:05:37.880
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is he a psychic?</v>

116
00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:40.580
<v Speaker 2>He predicted a billion things that never</v>
<v Speaker 2>happened.</v>

117
00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:45.050
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every day camps they've gotten coffins,</v>

118
00:05:45.051 --> 00:05:46.070
<v Speaker 2>plastic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>coffins.</v>

119
00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:49.640
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't mean that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was a clairvoyant.</v>

120
00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:51.230
<v Speaker 2>It means he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a tightly,</v>

121
00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:53.600
<v Speaker 2>tightly strong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tightly wound up fella.</v>

122
00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:54.453
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you think.</v>

123
00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:55.430
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

124
00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:58.070
<v Speaker 2>we debated it online on the air,</v>

125
00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:59.230
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

126
00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:00.170
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you,</v>

127
00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.470
<v Speaker 1>you can't say that there's no evidence</v>
<v Speaker 1>that shows that the government did it</v>

128
00:06:03.471 --> 00:06:05.600
<v Speaker 1>like you just because you suspect them</v>
<v Speaker 1>of doing it,</v>

129
00:06:05.601 --> 00:06:08.930
<v Speaker 1>you can't say it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's also crazy shit that happens in</v>

130
00:06:08.931 --> 00:06:11.480
<v Speaker 1>planes flying into buildings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I have a doctor,</v>

131
00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:13.390
<v Speaker 1>not a real good doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's a pot doctors.</v>

132
00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:16.310
<v Speaker 1>Dr Hans you out a medical marijuana</v>
<v Speaker 1>prescriptions,</v>

133
00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:19.610
<v Speaker 1>but I guess he went to medical school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go to them the other day and he hands</v>

134
00:06:19.611 --> 00:06:21.600
<v Speaker 1>me this book and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

135
00:06:21.601 --> 00:06:23.810
<v Speaker 1>this is very important information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I go,</v>

136
00:06:23.811 --> 00:06:26.120
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I start reading it and it's about</v>

137
00:06:26.121 --> 00:06:30.090
<v Speaker 1>tesla technology that they use to make</v>
<v Speaker 1>the twin towers disappeared.</v>

138
00:06:30.091 --> 00:06:32.000
<v Speaker 1>I got that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The twin towers,</v>

139
00:06:32.001 --> 00:06:34.970
<v Speaker 1>the reason why they turned into dust and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just didn't fall apart into big</v>

140
00:06:34.971 --> 00:06:36.610
<v Speaker 1>chunks is cars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tesla Tech.</v>

141
00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:40.020
<v Speaker 1>I thought he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was like having like a,</v>

142
00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:43.070
<v Speaker 1>like a mental issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I thought something had blown a</v>

143
00:06:43.071 --> 00:06:45.740
<v Speaker 1>fuse or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was so confused by the conversation.</v>

144
00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:49.850
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know what he was saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you're saying they used unknown</v>

145
00:06:49.851 --> 00:06:52.100
<v Speaker 1>technology to make the buildings</v>
<v Speaker 1>disappear.</v>

146
00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:54.320
<v Speaker 1>How did you know them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got a thick book.</v>

147
00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:58.580
<v Speaker 4>You see the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tesla mythology is a whole other area</v>

148
00:06:58.780 --> 00:06:59.960
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of BS,</v>

149
00:06:59.961 --> 00:07:01.460
<v Speaker 4>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is amazing.</v>

150
00:07:01.461 --> 00:07:04.640
<v Speaker 4>So many of the things that Tesla is</v>
<v Speaker 4>known for never happened.</v>

151
00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:06.200
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was,</v>

152
00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:09.380
<v Speaker 4>he was certainly a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a very brilliant man.</v>

153
00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:11.780
<v Speaker 4>Certainly a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>an innovative engineer,</v>

154
00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:15.410
<v Speaker 4>but he didn't invent AC.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He didn't invent electric motors.</v>

155
00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:18.530
<v Speaker 4>These are all things that already</v>
<v Speaker 4>existed that he continued working on.</v>

156
00:07:18.531 --> 00:07:21.380
<v Speaker 4>He never invented a death ray.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was completely nuts by the time of</v>

157
00:07:21.381 --> 00:07:22.820
<v Speaker 4>his life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He said he had a death ray.</v>

158
00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:27.480
<v Speaker 1>He and Edison did have the competition</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the competing ideas about alternating</v>

159
00:07:27.481 --> 00:07:30.380
<v Speaker 1>current and direct current.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was an advocate of alternating or</v>

160
00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:35.540
<v Speaker 1>alternating current where Edison in fact</v>
<v Speaker 1>did tests to show or did displays or</v>

161
00:07:35.571 --> 00:07:38.130
<v Speaker 1>other demonstrations to show that</v>
<v Speaker 1>dangers of this.</v>

162
00:07:38.131 --> 00:07:40.080
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things they did is they</v>
<v Speaker 1>fried an elephant.</v>

163
00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:41.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really fucked,</v>

164
00:07:41.791 --> 00:07:42.690
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you watch it.</v>

165
00:07:42.691 --> 00:07:44.550
<v Speaker 1>And he called it westing housing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he called it.</v>

166
00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:46.770
<v Speaker 1>We're going to westinghouse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this elephant now.</v>

167
00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:48.720
<v Speaker 1>He was hoping that that word would catch</v>
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

168
00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:50.190
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

169
00:07:50.191 --> 00:07:51.750
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know where you got the nine</v>

170
00:07:51.751 --> 00:07:54.960
<v Speaker 1>slash 11 thing from a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if I had listened to me talk about</v>

171
00:07:54.961 --> 00:07:57.300
<v Speaker 1>the moon landing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd probably assume that I was also a</v>

172
00:07:57.301 --> 00:08:00.420
<v Speaker 1>nonbeliever in nine slash 11.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So no,</v>

173
00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:02.580
<v Speaker 1>never said that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it never believed that.</v>

174
00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:05.880
<v Speaker 1>The only thing I've ever said that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>controversial at all is that tower</v>

175
00:08:05.881 --> 00:08:07.050
<v Speaker 1>seven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you watch it fall,</v>

176
00:08:07.051 --> 00:08:09.900
<v Speaker 1>it looks like in controlled demolition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't think that's controversial</v>

177
00:08:09.901 --> 00:08:11.340
<v Speaker 1>because it looks like a controlled</v>
<v Speaker 1>demolition.</v>

178
00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:12.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you look at just the top half of</v>

179
00:08:12.661 --> 00:08:13.200
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it does.</v>

180
00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:15.180
<v Speaker 1>When you look at the whole thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way the way the structure,</v>

181
00:08:15.181 --> 00:08:15.470
<v Speaker 1>correct.</v>

182
00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:17.360
<v Speaker 4>There's no video,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the whole thing,</v>

183
00:08:17.361 --> 00:08:20.800
<v Speaker 4>you can only see the video of the top.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really the top quarter of it as it</v>

184
00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:23.750
<v Speaker 4>disappears behind the building and I</v>
<v Speaker 4>agree it does look exactly like a</v>

185
00:08:23.751 --> 00:08:24.650
<v Speaker 4>controlled demolition.</v>

186
00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:26.670
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe it's more than the top</v>

187
00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:28.680
<v Speaker 1>quarter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pull the pull the video up of tower</v>

188
00:08:28.681 --> 00:08:31.080
<v Speaker 1>seven dropping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some pretty mean.</v>

189
00:08:31.081 --> 00:08:33.420
<v Speaker 1>There's at least 30 floors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're seeing.</v>

190
00:08:33.421 --> 00:08:35.040
<v Speaker 1>You're seeing a lot of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not really.</v>

191
00:08:35.041 --> 00:08:37.440
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say it's the top quarter is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>48 for building.</v>

192
00:08:37.470 --> 00:08:39.840
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not gonna argue the fraction,</v>

193
00:08:39.841 --> 00:08:42.020
<v Speaker 1>but you don't see the bottom of it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>true,</v>

194
00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:46.980
<v Speaker 1>but it is very unusual how it falls into</v>
<v Speaker 1>its base instead of the falls over,</v>

195
00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:47.460
<v Speaker 1>didn't</v>

196
00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:49.500
<v Speaker 4>it felt it started to fall down</v>
<v Speaker 4>straight,</v>

197
00:08:49.501 --> 00:08:52.440
<v Speaker 4>but then it almost destroyed two other</v>
<v Speaker 4>buildings that it fell against.</v>

198
00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:54.440
<v Speaker 4>It didn't fall into its own foot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

199
00:08:54.441 --> 00:08:57.830
<v Speaker 4>Which any building that they were</v>
<v Speaker 4>demolishing would probably do as well if</v>

200
00:08:57.831 --> 00:09:00.090
<v Speaker 4>they were that close to each other and</v>
<v Speaker 4>that went wrong.</v>

201
00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:00.860
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

202
00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:02.940
<v Speaker 4>We'll watch it again here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look at that.</v>

203
00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:05.010
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's way more than a tough quarter.</v>

204
00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:05.933
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not.</v>

205
00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:08.940
<v Speaker 4>That's almost the entire building was</v>
<v Speaker 4>not.</v>

206
00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:09.893
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's see.</v>

207
00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:11.970
<v Speaker 4>We'll see it again because we caught</v>
<v Speaker 4>that in the middle.</v>

208
00:09:11.971 --> 00:09:14.400
<v Speaker 4>Let's see it again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's see it from the top.</v>

209
00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:17.640
<v Speaker 4>This is not the best angle of a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 4>different angles.</v>

210
00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:18.840
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's say it again.</v>

211
00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:24.200
<v Speaker 4>Pull that one back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it disappears into the smoke</v>

212
00:09:24.421 --> 00:09:27.750
<v Speaker 4>before you can see,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think it's a bit disingenuous to</v>

213
00:09:27.751 --> 00:09:29.430
<v Speaker 4>say that the thing doesn't fall into its</v>
<v Speaker 4>base.</v>

214
00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:30.600
<v Speaker 4>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't.</v>

215
00:09:30.601 --> 00:09:32.670
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's already going at an angle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look at that.</v>

216
00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:35.370
<v Speaker 4>Look at the k,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it all fell to the bottom.</v>

217
00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:36.720
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's look at that one.</v>

218
00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:38.130
<v Speaker 4>Get her to fall to the top.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

219
00:09:38.131 --> 00:09:41.160
<v Speaker 4>but keep being kind of silly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That thing collapsed into its space.</v>

220
00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:42.870
<v Speaker 4>Look at that watch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here it goes.</v>

221
00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:47.130
<v Speaker 1>That is most of the building vanishes</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of sight.</v>

222
00:09:47.131 --> 00:09:51.510
<v Speaker 1>Who knows what happens from then on and</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure it ran into other buildings.</v>

223
00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:54.390
<v Speaker 1>The point is this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it never happened before and it looks</v>

224
00:09:54.391 --> 00:09:56.260
<v Speaker 1>like a controlled demolition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying,</v>

225
00:09:56.510 --> 00:09:58.830
<v Speaker 1>but let me be clarified because this is</v>
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>

226
00:09:58.831 --> 00:10:00.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying it's a controlled</v>
<v Speaker 1>demolition.</v>

227
00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:03.150
<v Speaker 1>I know I have no idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's what it looks like to say.</v>

228
00:10:03.151 --> 00:10:04.500
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't look like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of silly.</v>

229
00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:05.200
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I agree,</v>

230
00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:07.540
<v Speaker 4>but if you want to see how it fell into</v>
<v Speaker 4>its own base,</v>

231
00:10:07.541 --> 00:10:10.030
<v Speaker 4>quote unquote,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just look at the aerial photographs that</v>

232
00:10:10.031 --> 00:10:13.600
<v Speaker 4>were taken the next day when all the</v>
<v Speaker 4>smoke had cleared and you can see that</v>

233
00:10:13.601 --> 00:10:16.690
<v Speaker 4>didn't remotely fall into its own base.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It fell down the street and just</v>

234
00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:19.300
<v Speaker 4>practically destroyed two other</v>
<v Speaker 4>buildings so</v>

235
00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:21.850
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a matter of all that material has</v>

236
00:10:21.851 --> 00:10:24.100
<v Speaker 1>to go somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You had 48 floors of material and all</v>

237
00:10:24.101 --> 00:10:26.050
<v Speaker 1>comes down and collapsed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to fly.</v>

238
00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:28.450
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying it didn't fly to the</v>
<v Speaker 4>side.</v>

239
00:10:28.451 --> 00:10:29.920
<v Speaker 4>It fell over.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't.</v>

240
00:10:29.921 --> 00:10:33.520
<v Speaker 4>It didn't fall down and then out tube in</v>
<v Speaker 4>all directions like it splattered.</v>

241
00:10:33.521 --> 00:10:36.460
<v Speaker 4>It fell over.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It started going down and then it went</v>

242
00:10:36.461 --> 00:10:37.900
<v Speaker 4>to an angle and fell off to the side.</v>

243
00:10:38.950 --> 00:10:41.380
<v Speaker 1>This is a really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is an interesting thing because</v>

244
00:10:41.381 --> 00:10:45.760
<v Speaker 1>this is a thing that a lot of people</v>
<v Speaker 1>want the world to be very black and</v>

245
00:10:45.761 --> 00:10:50.320
<v Speaker 1>white and they want things like this to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be really simple to categorize.</v>

246
00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:53.500
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it is and I don't agree</v>
<v Speaker 1>with you that that didn't fall into its</v>

247
00:10:53.501 --> 00:10:54.580
<v Speaker 1>base.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

248
00:10:54.581 --> 00:10:57.280
<v Speaker 1>A lot of other shit happened and</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably big chunks of it landed on</v>

249
00:10:57.281 --> 00:11:00.100
<v Speaker 1>buildings nearby,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that thing collapsed into its base.</v>

250
00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:04.060
<v Speaker 1>Did it collapse into its base because of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a gigantic diesel fire that it consumed</v>

251
00:11:04.061 --> 00:11:06.580
<v Speaker 1>the innards of the building and weaken</v>
<v Speaker 1>the structure considerably?</v>

252
00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:07.930
<v Speaker 1>Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

253
00:11:07.931 --> 00:11:10.300
<v Speaker 1>That's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know a Goddamn thing about my</v>

254
00:11:10.301 --> 00:11:11.900
<v Speaker 1>dad's an architect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

255
00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:13.510
<v Speaker 1>I asked him about it and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

256
00:11:13.511 --> 00:11:15.160
<v Speaker 1>it's unusual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't know what the hell is</v>

257
00:11:15.161 --> 00:11:17.110
<v Speaker 1>going on inside of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't know what kind of damage</v>

258
00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:18.830
<v Speaker 1>sustained from having a building fall</v>
<v Speaker 1>out it.</v>

259
00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:21.160
<v Speaker 1>You don't know what that diesel fuel</v>
<v Speaker 1>burning,</v>

260
00:11:21.370 --> 00:11:22.420
<v Speaker 1>what it does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This structure.</v>

261
00:11:22.421 --> 00:11:23.920
<v Speaker 1>You don't know how they built the inside</v>
<v Speaker 1>of it.</v>

262
00:11:23.921 --> 00:11:25.300
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weird,</v>

263
00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:27.520
<v Speaker 1>but weird things happen when things</v>
<v Speaker 1>break.</v>

264
00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:32.020
<v Speaker 1>That was his take on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can't say that that doesn't look</v>

265
00:11:32.021 --> 00:11:33.640
<v Speaker 1>like a controlled demolition and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't.</v>

266
00:11:33.641 --> 00:11:35.390
<v Speaker 1>I said it does look like a controlled</v>
<v Speaker 1>demolition.</v>

267
00:11:35.391 --> 00:11:38.410
<v Speaker 1>The bodies that you can see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most controversial thing I've ever</v>

268
00:11:38.411 --> 00:11:41.710
<v Speaker 1>said about nine slash 11.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never said once that I think that</v>

269
00:11:41.711 --> 00:11:44.020
<v Speaker 1>the government engineered it or that it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was.</v>

270
00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:48.640
<v Speaker 1>I think it's very possible that big</v>
<v Speaker 1>events happen and then people capitalize</v>

271
00:11:48.641 --> 00:11:51.970
<v Speaker 1>on those events and then things happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the invasion of Iraq.</v>

272
00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.730
<v Speaker 1>They were probably looking for an excuse</v>
<v Speaker 1>do it anyway,</v>

273
00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:59.160
<v Speaker 1>but the idea that it was all one big</v>
<v Speaker 1>grand scheme to me seems ridiculously</v>

274
00:11:59.891 --> 00:12:00.450
<v Speaker 1>unlikely.</v>

275
00:12:00.450 --> 00:12:01.770
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me this,</v>

276
00:12:01.771 --> 00:12:06.480
<v Speaker 2>this was actually a good segue into um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we started to talk about,</v>

277
00:12:06.481 --> 00:12:09.480
<v Speaker 2>which was this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this inclusion that I have your back in</v>

278
00:12:09.481 --> 00:12:13.350
<v Speaker 2>this rise list of top celebrities</v>
<v Speaker 2>promoting pseudoscience.</v>

279
00:12:13.830 --> 00:12:14.850
<v Speaker 2>Because what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>

280
00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:18.120
<v Speaker 2>If someone had just listened to our last</v>
<v Speaker 2>five minutes here of the exchange,</v>

281
00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:21.630
<v Speaker 2>it sounded like you were trying to</v>
<v Speaker 2>convince me that nine slash 11 was a</v>

282
00:12:21.631 --> 00:12:24.920
<v Speaker 2>hoax to who were there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who would say that?</v>

283
00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:26.880
<v Speaker 2>I think anyone who listens to that five</v>
<v Speaker 2>minutes,</v>

284
00:12:26.881 --> 00:12:28.560
<v Speaker 2>it would sound like you were trying to</v>
<v Speaker 2>convince me.</v>

285
00:12:28.561 --> 00:12:30.180
<v Speaker 2>Building seven was a demolition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

286
00:12:30.181 --> 00:12:31.014
<v Speaker 2>it wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

287
00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:34.500
<v Speaker 1>I was very specific that I don't think</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's grayer.</v>

288
00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:35.990
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's a black and white</v>
<v Speaker 1>issue.</v>

289
00:12:35.991 --> 00:12:39.530
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a very gray area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that that building looked like</v>

290
00:12:39.531 --> 00:12:40.990
<v Speaker 1>it was demolished.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was it demolished?</v>

291
00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.070
<v Speaker 1>I absolutely don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm too dumb.</v>

292
00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:47.240
<v Speaker 1>I have zero education when it comes to</v>
<v Speaker 1>structural engineering zero education</v>

293
00:12:47.241 --> 00:12:51.380
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to the damage that a fire</v>
<v Speaker 1>can do to a structure and caused it to</v>

294
00:12:51.381 --> 00:12:53.420
<v Speaker 1>collapse and big chunks of buildings</v>
<v Speaker 1>hitting it.</v>

295
00:12:53.421 --> 00:12:54.710
<v Speaker 1>What that can do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

296
00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:56.930
<v Speaker 1>but when I look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looks like a controlled demolition.</v>

297
00:12:57.170 --> 00:13:00.230
<v Speaker 1>That does not sound like I'm trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>convince you that nine slash 11 was a</v>

298
00:13:00.231 --> 00:13:03.770
<v Speaker 1>hoax because I said very specifically</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I don't think it is,</v>

299
00:13:03.771 --> 00:13:07.760
<v Speaker 1>and then I think that it's ridiculous to</v>
<v Speaker 1>assume that someone could be so</v>

300
00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:12.440
<v Speaker 1>organized that they could talk these</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys into flying planes into buildings</v>

301
00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:14.990
<v Speaker 1>and that they can make it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that these buildings are rigged with</v>

302
00:13:14.991 --> 00:13:19.991
<v Speaker 1>explosives secretly and some clandestine</v>
<v Speaker 1>operation with the banks and the NSA and</v>

303
00:13:20.601 --> 00:13:23.300
<v Speaker 1>the dea and the CIA.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone coordinating together so that</v>

304
00:13:23.301 --> 00:13:25.330
<v Speaker 1>we could invade Iraq.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sounds ridiculous</v>

305
00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:28.760
<v Speaker 2>if you're a betting man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you had to bet yes or no.</v>

306
00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:31.040
<v Speaker 2>Was nine slash 11 orchestrated by the</v>
<v Speaker 2>government?</v>

307
00:13:31.041 --> 00:13:32.630
<v Speaker 2>If you had to bet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would you bet on?</v>

308
00:13:32.631 --> 00:13:34.130
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not 100 percent,</v>

309
00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:36.410
<v Speaker 2>but I will present that on them 100</v>
<v Speaker 2>percent,</v>

310
00:13:36.411 --> 00:13:37.244
<v Speaker 2>but I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

311
00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:41.230
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't be surprised if two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two additional possibilities.</v>

312
00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:44.740
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was something that they knew possibly</v>

313
00:13:44.741 --> 00:13:47.830
<v Speaker 1>could happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It didn't prevent against because either</v>

314
00:13:47.831 --> 00:13:51.850
<v Speaker 1>of a and competence or b,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to look at things like</v>

315
00:13:51.851 --> 00:13:54.670
<v Speaker 1>operation northwoods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to look at the Gulf of Tonkin.</v>

316
00:13:54.671 --> 00:13:56.740
<v Speaker 1>You have to look at real events that</v>
<v Speaker 1>took place,</v>

317
00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:59.610
<v Speaker 2>meal plans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that were questions.</v>

318
00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:01.940
<v Speaker 2>Those are separate questions I would</v>
<v Speaker 2>say.</v>

319
00:14:01.941 --> 00:14:05.000
<v Speaker 2>I would say there's always the</v>
<v Speaker 2>possibility that there was some</v>

320
00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:06.890
<v Speaker 2>knowledge of it before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that.</v>

321
00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:10.190
<v Speaker 2>But that's a separate question also.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then they orchestrated it and caused it</v>

322
00:14:10.191 --> 00:14:12.050
<v Speaker 2>to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do not have enough faith that the</v>

323
00:14:12.051 --> 00:14:15.440
<v Speaker 2>government is so competent that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>could pull off this amazingly intricate</v>

324
00:14:15.441 --> 00:14:17.090
<v Speaker 2>attack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you're 100 percent,</v>

325
00:14:17.170 --> 00:14:19.710
<v Speaker 2>if you're 100 percent betting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no question.</v>

326
00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:23.480
<v Speaker 2>So that means I might bet no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't mind that I'm asking for</v>

327
00:14:23.481 --> 00:14:26.090
<v Speaker 2>your personal level of confidence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your opinion and your personal.</v>

328
00:14:26.091 --> 00:14:28.380
<v Speaker 2>If you're forcing me to bet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I would bet no,</v>

329
00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:33.800
<v Speaker 2>I never say I know one way or the other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if I asked you what is your bet on</v>

330
00:14:33.801 --> 00:14:36.350
<v Speaker 2>whether building seven was a controlled</v>
<v Speaker 2>demolition,</v>

331
00:14:36.750 --> 00:14:38.120
<v Speaker 2>are you still 100 percent?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

332
00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:41.300
<v Speaker 2>I certainly wouldn't bet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I certainly wouldn't bet because I don't</v>

333
00:14:41.301 --> 00:14:43.310
<v Speaker 2>know enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if I looked at it the way,</v>

334
00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:44.230
<v Speaker 2>the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

335
00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:49.040
<v Speaker 2>a person who's objective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a person who understands what they know</v>

336
00:14:49.041 --> 00:14:52.010
<v Speaker 2>and what they don't know in this life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would to say it</v>

337
00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:55.160
<v Speaker 1>would be pretty fucking difficult to rig</v>
<v Speaker 1>a building with explosives and not have</v>

338
00:14:55.161 --> 00:14:57.740
<v Speaker 1>anybody know about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was pretty fucking difficult to make</v>

339
00:14:57.741 --> 00:15:01.340
<v Speaker 1>that building implode and have it be</v>
<v Speaker 1>some sort of a secret that people kept.</v>

340
00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:06.330
<v Speaker 1>It seems highly unlikely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems more likely to me that there's</v>

341
00:15:06.350 --> 00:15:08.600
<v Speaker 1>some sort of a catastrophic structural</v>
<v Speaker 1>failure.</v>

342
00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:13.100
<v Speaker 1>But I would fucking sue the shit out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>those people that built that movie,</v>

343
00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:14.510
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that building rather.</v>

344
00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:17.360
<v Speaker 1>If I was Larry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's his name that had a lateral</v>

345
00:15:17.361 --> 00:15:20.060
<v Speaker 1>Silverstein,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would sue the fuck out of the people</v>

346
00:15:20.061 --> 00:15:21.230
<v Speaker 1>that built that building.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

347
00:15:21.231 --> 00:15:23.750
<v Speaker 1>look at this building.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just fall down when it gets on fire like</v>

348
00:15:23.751 --> 00:15:25.880
<v Speaker 1>you assholes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess he got paid though from</v>

349
00:15:25.881 --> 00:15:26.481
<v Speaker 1>insurance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

350
00:15:26.481 --> 00:15:28.750
<v Speaker 1>He didn't need to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you didn't get that.</v>

351
00:15:29.090 --> 00:15:30.950
<v Speaker 1>Part of the conspiracy is that money was</v>
<v Speaker 1>made off.</v>

352
00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:32.060
<v Speaker 1>The conspiracy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the words,</v>

353
00:15:32.061 --> 00:15:32.990
<v Speaker 1>the wording,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pull it,</v>

354
00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:34.800
<v Speaker 1>pull it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact that you said pull it,</v>

355
00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:40.010
<v Speaker 1>it's my my take that anytime there's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>any sort of a catastrophic event,</v>

356
00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:42.830
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a murder or an accident or</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything,</v>

357
00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:46.850
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of people that look for</v>
<v Speaker 1>patterns in the chaos.</v>

358
00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:51.880
<v Speaker 1>There's a bunch of people that look for</v>
<v Speaker 1>a following plot line and look for some</v>

359
00:15:52.761 --> 00:15:56.390
<v Speaker 1>sort of nefarious connections between</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that would profit off this event</v>

360
00:15:56.391 --> 00:16:00.320
<v Speaker 1>and just the randomness of of chaotic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of being attacked,</v>

361
00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:04.760
<v Speaker 1>of of death and about destruction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's more likely that it's more</v>

362
00:16:04.761 --> 00:16:08.960
<v Speaker 1>likely that people are looking at this</v>
<v Speaker 1>and trying to make some sense out of it,</v>

363
00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:12.810
<v Speaker 1>but this crazy chaotic event where</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of suicide bombers,</v>

364
00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:13.880
<v Speaker 1>flew planes into a building.</v>

365
00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:16.310
<v Speaker 4>Things you know when?</v>
<v Speaker 4>When Neil Tyson was here.</v>

366
00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:17.350
<v Speaker 4>How long ago was that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Three,</v>

367
00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:18.500
<v Speaker 4>four months ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Something like that.</v>

368
00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:19.970
<v Speaker 4>It's about a year ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

369
00:16:19.971 --> 00:16:21.050
<v Speaker 4>He was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was.</v>

370
00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:26.150
<v Speaker 4>He was making the point about how he</v>
<v Speaker 4>tries very much to give people the tools</v>

371
00:16:26.570 --> 00:16:29.360
<v Speaker 4>to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't teach everyone all the facts,</v>

372
00:16:29.361 --> 00:16:32.360
<v Speaker 4>but you can give people the tools so</v>
<v Speaker 4>that they can probably figure out what's</v>

373
00:16:32.361 --> 00:16:33.890
<v Speaker 4>true,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's not true,</v>

374
00:16:34.010 --> 00:16:36.830
<v Speaker 4>and he made some points about why that's</v>
<v Speaker 4>a valuable thing to have,</v>

375
00:16:36.831 --> 00:16:40.700
<v Speaker 4>why it's good to have to be able to make</v>
<v Speaker 4>good decisions about the way the world</v>

376
00:16:40.701 --> 00:16:42.860
<v Speaker 4>works and to understand the way things</v>
<v Speaker 4>really happen.</v>

377
00:16:43.190 --> 00:16:45.200
<v Speaker 4>And it sounded to me like you've pretty</v>
<v Speaker 4>generally agreed with him.</v>

378
00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:46.940
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I would too.</v>

379
00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:52.420
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so in the case of this nine slash 11 as</v>

380
00:16:53.411 --> 00:16:54.141
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as an example,</v>

381
00:16:54.141 --> 00:16:56.210
<v Speaker 4>I mean we've got 100 different</v>
<v Speaker 4>conspiracy theories here,</v>

382
00:16:56.211 --> 00:16:56.930
<v Speaker 4>et Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 4>et cetera.</v>

383
00:16:56.930 --> 00:17:00.410
<v Speaker 4>And not even conspiracy theories,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but just playing up pseudosciences it</v>

384
00:17:00.411 --> 00:17:04.850
<v Speaker 4>makes just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it makes sense to help people to come to</v>

385
00:17:04.851 --> 00:17:06.650
<v Speaker 4>the right conclusion to come to a</v>
<v Speaker 4>conclusion.</v>

386
00:17:06.651 --> 00:17:09.800
<v Speaker 4>That's probably true because that's</v>
<v Speaker 4>symptomatic of all the other areas in</v>

387
00:17:09.801 --> 00:17:13.310
<v Speaker 4>their life where they're going to have</v>
<v Speaker 4>to consider issues and make up a good</v>

388
00:17:13.340 --> 00:17:16.400
<v Speaker 4>informed opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's probably more likely to be true.</v>

389
00:17:16.790 --> 00:17:18.170
<v Speaker 4>Wouldn't you agree with that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

390
00:17:18.171 --> 00:17:19.910
<v Speaker 4>that's really the same thing he's</v>
<v Speaker 4>saying.</v>

391
00:17:20.210 --> 00:17:25.210
<v Speaker 4>So if it then makes sense for you to to</v>
<v Speaker 4>to promote the idea that nine slash 11</v>

392
00:17:27.621 --> 00:17:30.470
<v Speaker 4>was probably not a government</v>
<v Speaker 4>conspiracy,</v>

393
00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:34.280
<v Speaker 4>then why would you spend five minutes</v>
<v Speaker 4>showing me this video and bringing it to</v>

394
00:17:34.281 --> 00:17:34.570
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>

395
00:17:34.570 --> 00:17:35.990
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to the attention of everyone on your</v>

396
00:17:35.991 --> 00:17:36.711
<v Speaker 4>show saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

397
00:17:36.711 --> 00:17:38.570
<v Speaker 4>look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look how it was probably a controlled</v>

398
00:17:38.571 --> 00:17:41.120
<v Speaker 4>demolition look.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry.</v>

399
00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:44.000
<v Speaker 4>Look how much it looked like a</v>
<v Speaker 4>controlled demolition because it does.</v>

400
00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:45.830
<v Speaker 4>Because it's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

401
00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:50.070
<v Speaker 4>but unless you're framing that within</v>
<v Speaker 4>the context of look</v>

402
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:53.520
<v Speaker 2>how easy it is to be mistaken,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is not what you said,</v>

403
00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:54.591
<v Speaker 2>but why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

404
00:17:54.591 --> 00:17:56.820
<v Speaker 2>Why do I have to do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And to just observe something that's</v>

405
00:17:56.821 --> 00:17:59.400
<v Speaker 2>fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to do it,</v>

406
00:17:59.430 --> 00:18:02.940
<v Speaker 2>but what Neil was Tyson was trying to</v>
<v Speaker 2>sell you on was the value of doing it.</v>

407
00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:05.130
<v Speaker 2>Help.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Giving people the tools to understand</v>

408
00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:07.530
<v Speaker 2>the way the world probably actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>work.</v>

409
00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:11.070
<v Speaker 2>How does that relate to you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Listening to me go on about how it looks</v>

410
00:18:11.071 --> 00:18:13.610
<v Speaker 2>like a controlled demolition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You agree that it looks like a</v>

411
00:18:13.630 --> 00:18:15.750
<v Speaker 2>controlled demolition and just because</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm expressing that,</v>

412
00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:17.610
<v Speaker 2>you're saying that if someone listened</v>
<v Speaker 2>to that,</v>

413
00:18:17.611 --> 00:18:20.850
<v Speaker 2>they think they would think rather than,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to convince you that nine</v>

414
00:18:20.851 --> 00:18:23.430
<v Speaker 2>slash 11 was a hoax.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a giant stretch.</v>

415
00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:27.090
<v Speaker 2>It I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's what it sounded like.</v>

416
00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:28.500
<v Speaker 2>I think sound like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To me,</v>

417
00:18:28.670 --> 00:18:30.990
<v Speaker 2>the most rational objective people</v>
<v Speaker 2>listening,</v>

418
00:18:30.991 --> 00:18:33.510
<v Speaker 2>they would have heard all the caveats</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I threw in there all the times that</v>

419
00:18:33.511 --> 00:18:35.850
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now I don't believe this.</v>

420
00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:38.840
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but looking at that and watching it</v>

421
00:18:38.841 --> 00:18:40.920
<v Speaker 2>collapse like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it looks like a controlled demolition.</v>

422
00:18:40.921 --> 00:18:45.030
<v Speaker 2>I think you'd be a fool to disagree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks exactly like that.</v>

423
00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:47.040
<v Speaker 2>Is it one?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not what I'm saying.</v>

424
00:18:47.190 --> 00:18:49.080
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've said very clearly.</v>

425
00:18:49.290 --> 00:18:51.660
<v Speaker 2>I know nothing about architecture</v>
<v Speaker 2>architecture.</v>

426
00:18:51.661 --> 00:18:54.600
<v Speaker 2>I know nothing about engineering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know nothing about the impact of</v>

427
00:18:54.601 --> 00:18:57.450
<v Speaker 2>diesel fire on concrete and steel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

428
00:18:57.930 --> 00:18:58.763
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

429
00:18:58.950 --> 00:19:02.490
<v Speaker 2>let me go back again to how this is a</v>
<v Speaker 2>good segue to what I wrote back in 2000,</v>

430
00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:06.450
<v Speaker 2>which hopefully the end result of me</v>
<v Speaker 2>being here today will be.</v>

431
00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:08.910
<v Speaker 2>I will get back to all my listeners and</v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

432
00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:12.630
<v Speaker 2>I'm retracting your appearance on this</v>
<v Speaker 2>list.</v>

433
00:19:13.170 --> 00:19:14.560
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so just a paragraph.</v>

434
00:19:14.561 --> 00:19:14.971
<v Speaker 2>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

435
00:19:14.971 --> 00:19:18.180
<v Speaker 2>If I read this short,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I think you were a number eight on my</v>

436
00:19:18.181 --> 00:19:21.990
<v Speaker 2>list of top 10 celebrities who promote</v>
<v Speaker 2>harmful pseudoscience,</v>

437
00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:24.930
<v Speaker 2>and here's the paragraph that I wrote on</v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

438
00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:26.040
<v Speaker 2>Number eight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe Rogan,</v>

439
00:19:26.610 --> 00:19:30.690
<v Speaker 2>comedian Joe Rogan does what he can to</v>
<v Speaker 2>promote virtually any conspiracy theory</v>

440
00:19:30.691 --> 00:19:34.600
<v Speaker 2>that he stumbles onto apparently</v>
<v Speaker 2>accepting them all uncritically where</v>

441
00:19:34.601 --> 00:19:36.780
<v Speaker 2>they wholesale embrace.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

442
00:19:36.781 --> 00:19:38.100
<v Speaker 2>I know you would disagree with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

443
00:19:38.130 --> 00:19:40.970
<v Speaker 2>of course it would and I want to give</v>
<v Speaker 2>you that chance so I'm me.</v>

444
00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:43.530
<v Speaker 2>Continue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He believes the Apollo astronauts did</v>

445
00:19:43.531 --> 00:19:46.590
<v Speaker 2>not land on the moon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He believes the US government was behind</v>

446
00:19:46.591 --> 00:19:50.190
<v Speaker 2>the nine slash 11 terrorist attacks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He believes the Oliver Stone version of</v>

447
00:19:50.191 --> 00:19:53.910
<v Speaker 2>the Kennedy assassination.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He believes aliens crashed at Roswell in</v>

448
00:19:53.911 --> 00:19:56.610
<v Speaker 2>1947 and the government is covering it</v>
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

449
00:19:57.210 --> 00:20:01.500
<v Speaker 2>He thinks men and black from project</v>
<v Speaker 2>blue book stole his friend's camera even</v>

450
00:20:01.501 --> 00:20:03.840
<v Speaker 2>though project blue book ended over 38</v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago.</v>

451
00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:07.050
<v Speaker 2>My friend was tanny 60,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way.</v>

452
00:20:07.210 --> 00:20:09.120
<v Speaker 2>I didn't steal his Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what to hear that story,</v>

453
00:20:09.121 --> 00:20:10.920
<v Speaker 2>but they took it when he was a little</v>
<v Speaker 2>boy.</v>

454
00:20:11.610 --> 00:20:13.530
<v Speaker 2>He took a photo of something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who knows what it was.</v>

455
00:20:13.531 --> 00:20:15.480
<v Speaker 2>I never said it was project blue book</v>
<v Speaker 2>guys,</v>

456
00:20:15.481 --> 00:20:17.130
<v Speaker 2>are they?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I told you what?</v>

457
00:20:17.131 --> 00:20:21.240
<v Speaker 2>My friend who was a flight surgeon told</v>
<v Speaker 2>me I wish to hell I had that.</v>

458
00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:23.430
<v Speaker 2>I had the reference for that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but let me just fits.</v>

459
00:20:23.431 --> 00:20:24.870
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's part of the call Steve and</v>

460
00:20:24.871 --> 00:20:26.010
<v Speaker 2>get them on the phone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Steve Graham.</v>

461
00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:26.970
<v Speaker 2>That'd be fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually,</v>

462
00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:30.570
<v Speaker 2>the worst part is that he promotes these</v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas to the public at every interview</v>

463
00:20:30.571 --> 00:20:33.300
<v Speaker 2>opportunity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but gives himself the intellectual get</v>

464
00:20:33.301 --> 00:20:38.301
<v Speaker 2>out of jail free card of not needing any</v>
<v Speaker 2>evidence by hiding behind the childish</v>

465
00:20:38.431 --> 00:20:40.440
<v Speaker 2>debate technique of saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

466
00:20:40.441 --> 00:20:42.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm just the guy asking questions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

467
00:20:42.601 --> 00:20:45.150
<v Speaker 2>this makes me sound like an asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

468
00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:47.830
<v Speaker 2>it's just factually inaccurate on so</v>
<v Speaker 2>many different levels.</v>

469
00:20:47.831 --> 00:20:47.980
<v Speaker 2>I don't</v>

470
00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:51.460
<v Speaker 1>understand why you wrote it like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's things that you said that I</v>

471
00:20:51.461 --> 00:20:53.830
<v Speaker 1>believe that I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I've never said that I do.</v>

472
00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:59.290
<v Speaker 1>What I'm willing to do is look stupid</v>
<v Speaker 1>and by talking about things and saying</v>

473
00:20:59.291 --> 00:21:02.650
<v Speaker 1>that looks like a controlled demolition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that puts you in the the nutter</v>

474
00:21:02.651 --> 00:21:04.600
<v Speaker 1>camp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not saying it's a controlled</v>

475
00:21:04.601 --> 00:21:07.660
<v Speaker 1>demolition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I say that not being willing to</v>

476
00:21:07.661 --> 00:21:10.930
<v Speaker 1>debate it and being insecure to discuss</v>
<v Speaker 1>it rather not debate it,</v>

477
00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:14.530
<v Speaker 1>but to discuss the reality of what</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're viewing is silly.</v>

478
00:21:14.590 --> 00:21:17.500
<v Speaker 1>It's preposterous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean I'm promoting the idea</v>

479
00:21:17.501 --> 00:21:20.740
<v Speaker 1>that nine slash 11 was an inside job or</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it was a plot by the government.</v>

480
00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:22.690
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never thought that,</v>

481
00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:25.390
<v Speaker 1>but I do think that building looks like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a controlled demolition.</v>

482
00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:28.150
<v Speaker 1>That's all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's anything wrong</v>

483
00:21:28.151 --> 00:21:28.984
<v Speaker 1>with saying that.</v>

484
00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:31.210
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think at the time that I did this,</v>

485
00:21:31.211 --> 00:21:33.910
<v Speaker 1>I think you had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was shortly after when you went on</v>

486
00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:39.300
<v Speaker 1>Penn Jillette's radio show and talked</v>
<v Speaker 1>with Phil plait about the moon.</v>

487
00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:41.410
<v Speaker 1>Remember that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

488
00:21:41.470 --> 00:21:43.570
<v Speaker 1>And you kicked his butt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

489
00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:44.920
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

490
00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:47.860
<v Speaker 1>I would not have handled that the way I</v>
<v Speaker 1>handle it then today,</v>

491
00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:51.850
<v Speaker 1>but there's two unfortunates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One was that I really wanted him when we</v>

492
00:21:51.851 --> 00:21:56.851
<v Speaker 1>first went on to give me a reason to not</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe what this Fox documentary showed</v>

493
00:21:57.341 --> 00:21:59.320
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the more I talked to him,</v>

494
00:21:59.321 --> 00:22:03.340
<v Speaker 1>the more I realized that he was almost</v>
<v Speaker 1>like talking in in a religious sense in</v>

495
00:22:03.341 --> 00:22:06.990
<v Speaker 1>that he wasn't willing to criticize any</v>
<v Speaker 1>aspect of,</v>

496
00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:10.870
<v Speaker 1>of NASA or any aspect of what was going</v>
<v Speaker 1>on during that time,</v>

497
00:22:10.871 --> 00:22:14.740
<v Speaker 1>including the point where he was trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to deny the fact that Werner Herzog or</v>

498
00:22:14.741 --> 00:22:18.700
<v Speaker 1>Wernher von Braun rather,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and many other scientists were actually</v>

499
00:22:18.701 --> 00:22:22.070
<v Speaker 1>Nazis that would come over and operation</v>
<v Speaker 1>paperclip and he's like,</v>

500
00:22:22.170 --> 00:22:23.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's trying to deny that there were</v>

501
00:22:23.711 --> 00:22:24.160
<v Speaker 1>Nazis.</v>

502
00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:24.470
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

503
00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:26.980
<v Speaker 1>this is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you're trying to deny historical</v>

504
00:22:26.981 --> 00:22:30.190
<v Speaker 1>fat because you think that historical</v>
<v Speaker 1>fact shades NASA in a bad way,</v>

505
00:22:30.191 --> 00:22:33.840
<v Speaker 1>and I don't think it does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the NASA of 1969 or [inaudible]</v>

506
00:22:33.841 --> 00:22:38.670
<v Speaker 1>63 when Kennedy was in office is not the</v>
<v Speaker 1>NASA of 2013 or 14.</v>

507
00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:40.360
<v Speaker 1>These.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These people are long dead and gone,</v>

508
00:22:40.690 --> 00:22:43.720
<v Speaker 1>and to deny that there was a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nazis involved.</v>

509
00:22:43.721 --> 00:22:47.140
<v Speaker 1>Seems to me that's not healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems to me like it's fucking with</v>

510
00:22:47.141 --> 00:22:49.510
<v Speaker 1>the facts and it doesn't support your</v>
<v Speaker 1>argument.</v>

511
00:22:49.511 --> 00:22:51.040
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes me question all the other</v>

512
00:22:51.041 --> 00:22:52.810
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so then I started getting aggressive</v>

513
00:22:52.811 --> 00:22:53.531
<v Speaker 1>with them because I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

514
00:22:53.531 --> 00:22:55.780
<v Speaker 1>you're being silly because this isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not.</v>

515
00:22:55.810 --> 00:22:58.210
<v Speaker 1>You're not being honest about the Nazis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not being honest about this</v>

516
00:22:58.211 --> 00:22:59.090
<v Speaker 1>connection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

517
00:22:59.310 --> 00:23:01.630
<v Speaker 1>well I got to throw that back at you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the hell does,</v>

518
00:23:01.631 --> 00:23:04.750
<v Speaker 1>whether they're not twos or not have</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything to do with whether we went to</v>

519
00:23:04.751 --> 00:23:05.260
<v Speaker 1>the moon?</v>

520
00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:06.070
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't,</v>

521
00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:10.060
<v Speaker 1>but denying the fact that there were</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nazis has something to do with what kind</v>

522
00:23:10.061 --> 00:23:13.450
<v Speaker 1>of information I'm getting from him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not getting unbiased information.</v>

523
00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:13.991
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember.</v>

524
00:23:13.991 --> 00:23:15.340
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember that part of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation,</v>

525
00:23:15.341 --> 00:23:18.600
<v Speaker 1>but I remember that Wernher von Braun</v>
<v Speaker 1>had gone to Antarctica to pick,</v>

526
00:23:18.601 --> 00:23:23.601
<v Speaker 1>to collect rocks to collect meteors and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you brought that up and I think you said</v>

527
00:23:24.370 --> 00:23:26.740
<v Speaker 1>words to the effect of why the heck</v>
<v Speaker 1>would he have done that?</v>

528
00:23:26.741 --> 00:23:30.520
<v Speaker 1>Unless it was part of some grander</v>
<v Speaker 1>scheme to fake bringing rocks back from</v>

529
00:23:30.521 --> 00:23:31.660
<v Speaker 1>the mood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Am I correct about that?</v>

530
00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:32.650
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

531
00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:35.110
<v Speaker 1>I said Wernher von Braun did go to</v>
<v Speaker 1>Antarctica.</v>

532
00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:37.150
<v Speaker 1>You did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When they were preparing for the moon</v>

533
00:23:37.151 --> 00:23:38.620
<v Speaker 1>landing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Phil Phil had no idea.</v>

534
00:23:38.621 --> 00:23:40.410
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he said he had never even heard</v>

535
00:23:40.430 --> 00:23:44.170
<v Speaker 1>that fact when I was a lot of photos</v>
<v Speaker 1>online of Wernher von Braun and this big</v>

536
00:23:44.171 --> 00:23:44.650
<v Speaker 1>crew.</v>

537
00:23:44.650 --> 00:23:46.850
<v Speaker 1>There was one of the few places where</v>
<v Speaker 1>they could go.</v>

538
00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:49.310
<v Speaker 1>They could study meteors that were</v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely from the moon.</v>

539
00:23:49.850 --> 00:23:51.600
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and fill it,</v>

540
00:23:51.610 --> 00:23:52.400
<v Speaker 1>fill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

541
00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:54.490
<v Speaker 1>fills an astronomer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not a space historian.</v>

542
00:23:54.770 --> 00:23:56.510
<v Speaker 1>I understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would have no reason to know that,</v>

543
00:23:56.511 --> 00:23:57.920
<v Speaker 1>but why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why were you bringing that up?</v>

544
00:23:57.921 --> 00:23:59.240
<v Speaker 1>What does that have to do with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>question?</v>

545
00:23:59.270 --> 00:24:01.670
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the big conspiracy was of course that he</v>

546
00:24:01.671 --> 00:24:05.360
<v Speaker 1>had brought these rocks back from there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then somehow or another,</v>

547
00:24:05.361 --> 00:24:07.430
<v Speaker 1>those were the ones that they forged for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the moon rocks.</v>

548
00:24:07.850 --> 00:24:10.190
<v Speaker 1>When they talked about where'd they get</v>
<v Speaker 1>these rocks from the moon?</v>

549
00:24:10.191 --> 00:24:11.960
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's absolutely meteors that came</v>

550
00:24:11.961 --> 00:24:14.150
<v Speaker 1>from the moon that are in Antarctica.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can find them,</v>

551
00:24:14.330 --> 00:24:17.630
<v Speaker 1>they can retrieve them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've documented that so that the idea</v>

552
00:24:17.631 --> 00:24:19.280
<v Speaker 1>is that you have a chunk of the moon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's,</v>

553
00:24:19.310 --> 00:24:20.930
<v Speaker 1>here's the rocks we brought back from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the moon.</v>

554
00:24:21.210 --> 00:24:24.050
<v Speaker 1>We want to know what to look for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We want to know what their,</v>

555
00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:26.490
<v Speaker 1>what kind of mass they've got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things like that to how to,</v>

556
00:24:26.540 --> 00:24:28.010
<v Speaker 1>how to make room for them in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>spaceship.</v>

557
00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:29.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What they're made out of,</v>

558
00:24:29.391 --> 00:24:32.450
<v Speaker 1>what their contents are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and as an alternative that could be seen</v>

559
00:24:32.451 --> 00:24:35.420
<v Speaker 1>as being consistent with the moon</v>
<v Speaker 1>landing was exactly,</v>

560
00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:37.790
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would you call it?</v>

561
00:24:37.791 --> 00:24:40.160
<v Speaker 1>Evidence or would you call it consistent</v>
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>

562
00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:41.510
<v Speaker 1>Or would you say those are the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing?</v>

563
00:24:41.511 --> 00:24:43.670
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say it's evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

564
00:24:43.671 --> 00:24:44.504
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all you.</v>

565
00:24:45.010 --> 00:24:46.850
<v Speaker 1>Let's say that they could land on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>moon.</v>

566
00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:47.750
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say,</v>

567
00:24:47.751 --> 00:24:50.240
<v Speaker 1>which by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe now and let's say that,</v>

568
00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:52.580
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they took spaceships and they went there</v>

569
00:24:52.581 --> 00:24:56.150
<v Speaker 1>and they brought back moon rocks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if you knew for sure that there</v>

570
00:24:56.151 --> 00:25:00.140
<v Speaker 1>were some moon rocks in Antarctica,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would absolutely go there and study</v>

571
00:25:00.141 --> 00:25:00.650
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

572
00:25:00.650 --> 00:25:03.920
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's a bad thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I do think that if you're a guy</v>

573
00:25:03.921 --> 00:25:08.780
<v Speaker 1>looking for something that confirms your</v>
<v Speaker 1>suspicions of a of a conspiracy,</v>

574
00:25:08.781 --> 00:25:10.400
<v Speaker 1>which I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>

575
00:25:10.401 --> 00:25:12.680
<v Speaker 1>well look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they went to get moon rocks and that's</v>

576
00:25:12.770 --> 00:25:13.640
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the big thing.</v>

577
00:25:13.641 --> 00:25:16.970
<v Speaker 1>They always say they brought back x</v>
<v Speaker 1>kilograms of moon rocks where they get</v>

578
00:25:16.971 --> 00:25:18.380
<v Speaker 1>those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They went to Antarctica,</v>

579
00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:19.900
<v Speaker 1>they got them from the Antarctica.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And look,</v>

580
00:25:19.910 --> 00:25:23.390
<v Speaker 1>here's a photo of Warner von Braun in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Antarctica collecting moon rocks with a</v>

581
00:25:23.391 --> 00:25:25.160
<v Speaker 1>fucking cast on his arm for some strange</v>
<v Speaker 1>reason.</v>

582
00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:26.420
<v Speaker 1>How'd he break his arm?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know?</v>

583
00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:28.370
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that he had some old</v>

584
00:25:28.371 --> 00:25:31.850
<v Speaker 1>school cast to mad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some fucking funky cartoon casts with</v>

585
00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:35.030
<v Speaker 1>like a bar between them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He must've really jacked his arm,</v>

586
00:25:35.330 --> 00:25:37.430
<v Speaker 1>but they probably broke his arm to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>him to lie about going to the moon.</v>

587
00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:39.770
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got it all locked up.</v>

588
00:25:40.670 --> 00:25:41.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

589
00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:42.171
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

590
00:25:42.171 --> 00:25:44.180
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't podcasting then.</v>

591
00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:47.390
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I certainly wasn't watching as many</v>

592
00:25:47.391 --> 00:25:48.920
<v Speaker 1>documentaries and reading these many</v>
<v Speaker 1>books.</v>

593
00:25:48.921 --> 00:25:51.200
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in the middle of doing fear factor</v>

594
00:25:51.201 --> 00:25:54.410
<v Speaker 1>in working for the UFC and I'd watched</v>
<v Speaker 1>this documentary on the Fox,</v>

595
00:25:54.770 --> 00:25:57.770
<v Speaker 1>the Fox documentary on a conspiracy</v>
<v Speaker 1>theory.</v>

596
00:25:57.950 --> 00:26:01.010
<v Speaker 1>Did we really go to the moon and it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>incredibly compelling,</v>

597
00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:04.430
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're a retard like me</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're watching Brian O'leary,</v>

598
00:26:04.431 --> 00:26:07.790
<v Speaker 1>who was an astronaut saying that he</v>
<v Speaker 1>could see that they could fake it and</v>

599
00:26:07.791 --> 00:26:10.980
<v Speaker 1>you're watching bill casing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the guy who worked at Rocketdyne</v>

600
00:26:11.030 --> 00:26:13.790
<v Speaker 1>and he said that the engineers all agree</v>
<v Speaker 1>that no one could do this,</v>

601
00:26:13.791 --> 00:26:16.910
<v Speaker 1>and then you look at the different</v>
<v Speaker 1>backgrounds that they showed in</v>

602
00:26:16.911 --> 00:26:20.420
<v Speaker 1>different trips and they were basically</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same background,</v>

603
00:26:20.421 --> 00:26:21.560
<v Speaker 1>but they were nowhere near each other.</v>

604
00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:24.320
<v Speaker 1>They had done it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've done a really good job of</v>

605
00:26:24.321 --> 00:26:28.280
<v Speaker 1>piecing together all this weirdness and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then do it with a narrator and spell it</v>

606
00:26:28.281 --> 00:26:29.780
<v Speaker 1>out for you and I bought it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hook,</v>

607
00:26:29.781 --> 00:26:30.830
<v Speaker 1>line,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and sinker for sure.</v>

608
00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:34.190
<v Speaker 1>The the real issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a bunch of real issues with</v>

609
00:26:34.191 --> 00:26:35.420
<v Speaker 1>faking the moon lane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

610
00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:37.490
<v Speaker 1>the numbers of people that would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>involved,</v>

611
00:26:37.850 --> 00:26:42.500
<v Speaker 1>the amount of technology that you would</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to discount where people could</v>

612
00:26:42.501 --> 00:26:47.501
<v Speaker 1>track lunar module as it went in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>lineage of creating the Saturn five and</v>

613
00:26:48.181 --> 00:26:51.450
<v Speaker 1>how they see the stages of detached and</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the different mathematical</v>

614
00:26:51.451 --> 00:26:55.380
<v Speaker 1>calculations they did create them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you break it down to an hour</v>

615
00:26:55.740 --> 00:26:59.730
<v Speaker 1>documentary for a dummy and you put some</v>
<v Speaker 1>spooky music in it and you keep cutting</v>

616
00:26:59.731 --> 00:27:01.980
<v Speaker 1>back and forth to commercials,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to believe that we didn't</v>

617
00:27:01.981 --> 00:27:02.760
<v Speaker 1>go to the moon.</v>

618
00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:04.710
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the easiest ID in the world to</v>

619
00:27:04.711 --> 00:27:09.360
<v Speaker 4>sell.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Conspiracy theories are so just people</v>

620
00:27:09.361 --> 00:27:11.970
<v Speaker 4>want to believe them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They satisfy so much.</v>

621
00:27:12.090 --> 00:27:14.400
<v Speaker 4>They're fun to fund.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It makes you feel like you've got some</v>

622
00:27:14.401 --> 00:27:16.830
<v Speaker 4>secret insider information,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's also.</v>

623
00:27:16.831 --> 00:27:17.664
<v Speaker 4>There was evidence that</v>

624
00:27:17.690 --> 00:27:22.490
<v Speaker 1>NASA did fake some publicity shots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They did from the Gemini Program,</v>

625
00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:25.640
<v Speaker 1>Michael Collins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they used a photo of him where he was in</v>

626
00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:30.700
<v Speaker 1>a simulator and they used it and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>blacked it out and had the exact same</v>

627
00:27:31.731 --> 00:27:35.480
<v Speaker 1>image and released it as a press photo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what is this deception?</v>

628
00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:37.580
<v Speaker 1>Does that mean that there was deception</v>
<v Speaker 1>across the board?</v>

629
00:27:37.581 --> 00:27:40.700
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I did this Saifai show and in the</v>

630
00:27:40.701 --> 00:27:44.870
<v Speaker 1>middle of the Scifi show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who is an editor took some</v>

631
00:27:44.871 --> 00:27:49.820
<v Speaker 1>footage and spliced in some sound and</v>
<v Speaker 1>faked something and said that a user</v>

632
00:27:49.821 --> 00:27:54.560
<v Speaker 1>centered in not to my knowledge and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>found out about it and freaked out and I</v>

633
00:27:54.561 --> 00:27:55.071
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

634
00:27:55.071 --> 00:27:56.570
<v Speaker 1>when you fake one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we,</v>

635
00:27:56.600 --> 00:28:00.200
<v Speaker 1>we spent this entire show trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out the truth about something and</v>

636
00:28:00.201 --> 00:28:02.900
<v Speaker 1>you guys for dramatic effect faked one</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

637
00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:07.040
<v Speaker 1>you fucked up the whole show because</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you did is you cast doubt on</v>

638
00:28:07.070 --> 00:28:09.740
<v Speaker 1>everything else this show is ever going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to say ever.</v>

639
00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:14.780
<v Speaker 1>Like literally hast almost die right</v>
<v Speaker 1>here because you're the ethic of</v>

640
00:28:14.781 --> 00:28:18.080
<v Speaker 1>creating a completely honest show has</v>
<v Speaker 1>already been gone.</v>

641
00:28:18.230 --> 00:28:22.880
<v Speaker 1>It's already been washed away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you watch something like the</v>

642
00:28:22.881 --> 00:28:25.610
<v Speaker 1>moon landing and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look at the,</v>

643
00:28:25.660 --> 00:28:30.290
<v Speaker 1>these guys hopping around on the moon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you kind of almost want it to be</v>

644
00:28:30.291 --> 00:28:32.420
<v Speaker 1>bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kind of like what they fuck.</v>

645
00:28:32.530 --> 00:28:33.830
<v Speaker 1>They got to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come on man.</v>

646
00:28:33.831 --> 00:28:35.690
<v Speaker 1>How the fuck you look up at the moon?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have Fuck,</v>

647
00:28:35.691 --> 00:28:38.300
<v Speaker 1>are they getting up there and then you</v>
<v Speaker 1>find shit like this where they show</v>

648
00:28:38.301 --> 00:28:39.430
<v Speaker 1>these images of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

649
00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:43.760
<v Speaker 1>Michael Collins in the simulator and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the exact image all blacked out</v>

650
00:28:43.761 --> 00:28:46.030
<v Speaker 1>background saying that he's actually in</v>
<v Speaker 1>space like,</v>

651
00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:46.980
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's in Spain.</v>

652
00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:48.760
<v Speaker 1>Who's taken this picture of him in space</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this?</v>

653
00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:50.630
<v Speaker 1>He's not in space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the same image.</v>

654
00:28:50.890 --> 00:28:53.510
<v Speaker 1>Like you guys lied.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So because of that,</v>

655
00:28:53.790 --> 00:28:55.220
<v Speaker 1>NASA is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not perfect.</v>

656
00:28:55.370 --> 00:28:59.210
<v Speaker 1>They weren't perfect in the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they hired a bunch of Nazis and brought</v>

657
00:28:59.211 --> 00:29:00.740
<v Speaker 1>them over from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from Germany.</v>

658
00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:03.230
<v Speaker 1>They weren't perfect in the fact that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

659
00:29:03.231 --> 00:29:07.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure some people in the publicity</v>
<v Speaker 1>department told some tall tales and spun</v>

660
00:29:07.671 --> 00:29:11.360
<v Speaker 1>some yarns and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had a makeup for Gus Grisham dying</v>

661
00:29:11.361 --> 00:29:14.090
<v Speaker 1>in that simulator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of like horrible</v>

662
00:29:14.091 --> 00:29:16.820
<v Speaker 1>publicity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>snafoos terrible things that went wrong</v>

663
00:29:16.821 --> 00:29:19.640
<v Speaker 1>that eroded people's confidence in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in NASA.</v>

664
00:29:19.850 --> 00:29:24.850
<v Speaker 1>I could easily see a fake here or there</v>
<v Speaker 1>a photograph that was that was</v>

665
00:29:26.390 --> 00:29:30.770
<v Speaker 1>staged here or there that they said</v>
<v Speaker 1>happened on the moon or that they said</v>

666
00:29:30.771 --> 00:29:34.430
<v Speaker 1>happened in space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that that means</v>

667
00:29:34.431 --> 00:29:37.790
<v Speaker 1>necessarily that the moon landing was</v>
<v Speaker 1>faked though then I did.</v>

668
00:29:38.150 --> 00:29:38.890
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's,</v>

669
00:29:38.890 --> 00:29:41.030
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's pretty common piece of feedback</v>

670
00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:42.010
<v Speaker 4>that I'll get when</v>

671
00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:45.010
<v Speaker 2>I do an episode on any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any given conspiracy theory and let's</v>

672
00:29:45.011 --> 00:29:47.710
<v Speaker 2>say it's one like this that involves the</v>
<v Speaker 2>government.</v>

673
00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:50.530
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the feedback that I'll get is so you</v>

674
00:29:50.531 --> 00:29:53.260
<v Speaker 2>believe the government loves us and is</v>
<v Speaker 2>perfect and everything they do,</v>

675
00:29:53.530 --> 00:29:54.363
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

676
00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:58.990
<v Speaker 2>it's not necessary for NASA to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>perfect for us to have gone to the moon.</v>

677
00:29:58.991 --> 00:30:02.380
<v Speaker 2>It's not necessary for the government to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be perfect for nine slash 11,</v>

678
00:30:02.381 --> 00:30:04.660
<v Speaker 2>not to have been an incense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The classic Straw man.</v>

679
00:30:04.810 --> 00:30:06.000
<v Speaker 2>Black and white argument.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

680
00:30:06.001 --> 00:30:06.340
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>

681
00:30:06.340 --> 00:30:09.640
<v Speaker 2>You're either and that's exactly what I</v>
<v Speaker 2>said about the building collapsing.</v>

682
00:30:09.810 --> 00:30:11.300
<v Speaker 2>It's basically the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not.</v>

683
00:30:11.530 --> 00:30:14.860
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean that the government is</v>
<v Speaker 2>beautiful and perfect in every way</v>

684
00:30:14.861 --> 00:30:17.350
<v Speaker 2>because they managed to go to the bone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Agreed.</v>

685
00:30:17.590 --> 00:30:19.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So should we go through this checklist</v>

686
00:30:19.421 --> 00:30:21.280
<v Speaker 2>here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which of these I can take off?</v>

687
00:30:21.310 --> 00:30:21.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was,</v>

688
00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:22.660
<v Speaker 2>what was the other one?</v>

689
00:30:22.660 --> 00:30:25.720
<v Speaker 2>You had another one that I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's start with a violently disagreed</v>

690
00:30:25.721 --> 00:30:28.150
<v Speaker 2>with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was was the first one.</v>

691
00:30:28.250 --> 00:30:30.000
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fascination.</v>

692
00:30:30.140 --> 00:30:31.670
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He believes the Apollo astronauts didn't</v>

693
00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:32.590
<v Speaker 2>land on the moon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's gone.</v>

694
00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:33.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

695
00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:34.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

696
00:30:34.390 --> 00:30:35.560
<v Speaker 2>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm checking it off.</v>

697
00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:38.470
<v Speaker 2>I would love it if it was a hoax style.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I found out that it was a hoax,</v>

698
00:30:38.471 --> 00:30:40.910
<v Speaker 2>I got to tell you right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would love it almost more than I love</v>

699
00:30:40.911 --> 00:30:43.540
<v Speaker 2>the fact that people went to the moon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would love it if it was a hoax.</v>

700
00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:45.280
<v Speaker 2>Capricorn won.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Best movie ever.</v>

701
00:30:45.310 --> 00:30:45.990
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't.</v>

702
00:30:45.990 --> 00:30:47.530
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't even close.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a good movie,</v>

703
00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:50.260
<v Speaker 2>but alien was the best movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alien one,</v>

704
00:30:50.261 --> 00:30:52.030
<v Speaker 2>the first one in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it had,</v>

705
00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:55.750
<v Speaker 2>it had the evil corporate government</v>
<v Speaker 2>conspiracy behind it.</v>

706
00:30:55.780 --> 00:30:57.280
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do not believe in knowledge over</v>

707
00:30:57.310 --> 00:30:58.480
<v Speaker 2>stones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in fact,</v>

708
00:30:58.590 --> 00:31:03.250
<v Speaker 2>have criticized that film on this</v>
<v Speaker 2>podcast many times because Oliver stone</v>

709
00:31:03.251 --> 00:31:05.890
<v Speaker 2>created in the Donald Sutherland</v>
<v Speaker 2>character.</v>

710
00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:09.640
<v Speaker 2>They can use this vehicle for this</v>
<v Speaker 2>general that's giving him this</v>

711
00:31:09.641 --> 00:31:14.560
<v Speaker 2>information in order to spell it all out</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the Kevin Costner character.</v>

712
00:31:14.561 --> 00:31:16.060
<v Speaker 2>I've never said that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I've said.</v>

713
00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:17.500
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you look at that bullet,</v>

714
00:31:17.501 --> 00:31:18.850
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't look like went through</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

715
00:31:18.940 --> 00:31:20.620
<v Speaker 2>That's what I've said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because if you look at the single</v>

716
00:31:20.621 --> 00:31:22.510
<v Speaker 2>bullet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it does not look like it penetrated</v>

717
00:31:22.511 --> 00:31:24.090
<v Speaker 2>bone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See that bones are.</v>

718
00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:25.300
<v Speaker 2>You see that Scott?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a hunter.</v>

719
00:31:25.690 --> 00:31:28.210
<v Speaker 2>I'm an actual bonafide hunter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know what it looks like when bullets</v>

720
00:31:28.211 --> 00:31:32.140
<v Speaker 2>hit meet and that that bullet does not</v>
<v Speaker 2>look like it went through to people.</v>

721
00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:36.070
<v Speaker 2>Did you beat the fuck out of that thing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nice to save any.</v>

722
00:31:36.550 --> 00:31:38.830
<v Speaker 2>I have some.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll get you some you like.</v>

723
00:31:38.831 --> 00:31:39.940
<v Speaker 2>Do you like venison?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love it.</v>

724
00:31:39.970 --> 00:31:43.140
<v Speaker 2>I just got one in Wisconsin last month.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Relatives in Oregon.</v>

725
00:31:43.150 --> 00:31:44.260
<v Speaker 2>They're sending us stuff all the time.</v>

726
00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:47.330
<v Speaker 2>The best meat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so delicious and so healthy and I</v>

727
00:31:47.331 --> 00:31:50.080
<v Speaker 2>like the fact that it's wild.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's running around wild and then you</v>

728
00:31:50.081 --> 00:31:54.670
<v Speaker 2>take it out of the mix,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've never said that Oliver Stone</v>

729
00:31:54.671 --> 00:31:55.570
<v Speaker 2>was right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

730
00:31:55.580 --> 00:31:57.880
<v Speaker 2>I've said there was A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I liked the movie,</v>

731
00:31:57.881 --> 00:32:00.190
<v Speaker 2>I think Kevin Costner and knocked it out</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the park.</v>

732
00:32:00.191 --> 00:32:03.610
<v Speaker 2>I think it was an interesting movie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what I've like about it is that it</v>

733
00:32:03.611 --> 00:32:07.240
<v Speaker 2>opens up this idea where people start to</v>
<v Speaker 2>question what happened.</v>

734
00:32:07.530 --> 00:32:07.991
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

735
00:32:07.991 --> 00:32:11.650
<v Speaker 2>I think what I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I meant by that statement was you.</v>

736
00:32:11.950 --> 00:32:15.070
<v Speaker 2>You don't believe that Lee Harvey Oswald</v>
<v Speaker 2>acted alone.</v>

737
00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:17.020
<v Speaker 2>I do not believe Lee Harvey Oswald acted</v>
<v Speaker 2>alone.</v>

738
00:32:17.170 --> 00:32:18.880
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's ample evidence that</v>

739
00:32:18.881 --> 00:32:21.850
<v Speaker 2>there was other people involved,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that doesn't mean that Lee Harvey</v>

740
00:32:21.850 --> 00:32:24.280
<v Speaker 2>Oswald wasn't involved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's another black or white thing.</v>

741
00:32:24.281 --> 00:32:28.000
<v Speaker 2>Everybody wants an either or.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's very possible that Lee</v>

742
00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:29.380
<v Speaker 2>Harvey Oswald was in cahoots with that</v>
<v Speaker 2>murder.</v>

743
00:32:29.620 --> 00:32:31.720
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lee Harvey Oswald was on the scene.</v>

744
00:32:32.020 --> 00:32:35.590
<v Speaker 2>Second of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lee Harvey Oswald was known to be in bed</v>

745
00:32:35.591 --> 00:32:38.560
<v Speaker 2>with all these fucking Weirdo characters</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had brought.</v>

746
00:32:38.590 --> 00:32:40.040
<v Speaker 2>He had gone Russia and</v>

747
00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:44.390
<v Speaker 1>brought back a woman and was allowed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>reenter the United States.</v>

748
00:32:44.810 --> 00:32:49.810
<v Speaker 1>The fact that Jack Ruby got to Lee</v>
<v Speaker 1>Harvey Oswald and the really high</v>

749
00:32:50.031 --> 00:32:54.170
<v Speaker 1>pressure situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she shot the fucking president and you</v>

750
00:32:54.171 --> 00:32:57.440
<v Speaker 1>just have them wandering through with</v>
<v Speaker 1>this gangster can run up to them and put</v>

751
00:32:57.441 --> 00:32:59.600
<v Speaker 1>a bullet in him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It plays out like a movie,</v>

752
00:32:59.601 --> 00:33:02.240
<v Speaker 1>so in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you've got a lot of anomalies that</v>

753
00:33:02.241 --> 00:33:07.241
<v Speaker 1>are consistent with any conspiracy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conspiracy and but my take on it is not</v>

754
00:33:08.241 --> 00:33:10.330
<v Speaker 1>that I know or that I believe in Oliver</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stone.</v>

755
00:33:10.340 --> 00:33:13.970
<v Speaker 1>My take on it is what a colossal strange</v>
<v Speaker 1>event,</v>

756
00:33:14.210 --> 00:33:19.210
<v Speaker 1>a changing of us history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a changing of the way we look at the</v>

757
00:33:19.250 --> 00:33:23.330
<v Speaker 1>power of being a president,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a changing of the way we look at what</v>

758
00:33:23.331 --> 00:33:27.650
<v Speaker 1>can happen to someone in this lifetime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When someone who is so beloved as John F</v>

759
00:33:27.650 --> 00:33:30.560
<v Speaker 1>Kennedy disappears off the face of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>earth and the world instantaneously</v>

760
00:33:30.561 --> 00:33:31.340
<v Speaker 1>changes.</v>

761
00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:34.880
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a fascinating story and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>also think it's fascinating how many</v>

762
00:33:34.881 --> 00:33:37.880
<v Speaker 1>enemies he had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't discount when you're talking</v>

763
00:33:37.881 --> 00:33:42.170
<v Speaker 1>about people who were involved with</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who have created wars,</v>

764
00:33:42.380 --> 00:33:47.030
<v Speaker 1>people who have absolutely been</v>
<v Speaker 1>responsible for the death of untold</v>

765
00:33:47.031 --> 00:33:49.730
<v Speaker 1>thousands of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't discount the idea that they</v>

766
00:33:49.731 --> 00:33:51.980
<v Speaker 1>would organize a coup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if they did,</v>

767
00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:55.750
<v Speaker 1>but I do know that that thing was one</v>
<v Speaker 1>colossal clusterfuck,</v>

768
00:33:56.060 --> 00:33:58.850
<v Speaker 1>a crazy thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that the fact that the film was held</v>

769
00:33:58.851 --> 00:34:03.851
<v Speaker 1>back until her Waldo Rivera of all</v>
<v Speaker 1>people put it on television with Dick</v>

770
00:34:04.730 --> 00:34:08.000
<v Speaker 1>Gregory who bought a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't even realize is a great comedian,</v>

771
00:34:08.001 --> 00:34:10.550
<v Speaker 1>was a great comedian and an activist at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>

772
00:34:10.790 --> 00:34:15.050
<v Speaker 1>And it was way into the seventies that</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dick Gregory played this on Geraldo</v>

773
00:34:15.050 --> 00:34:16.820
<v Speaker 1>Rivera show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you get to see Kennedy's head</v>

774
00:34:16.821 --> 00:34:18.410
<v Speaker 1>snapped back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this router film.</v>

775
00:34:18.860 --> 00:34:21.680
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that that means that</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone else did it.</v>

776
00:34:21.950 --> 00:34:24.860
<v Speaker 1>I think it means there's probably more</v>
<v Speaker 1>than one person involved.</v>

777
00:34:25.100 --> 00:34:28.250
<v Speaker 1>And when you look at the Warren</v>
<v Speaker 1>Commission report and you look at the</v>

778
00:34:28.251 --> 00:34:30.680
<v Speaker 1>inconsistency is in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a great book about it called the</v>

779
00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:33.100
<v Speaker 1>best evidence by David Lifton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was,</v>

780
00:34:33.101 --> 00:34:35.450
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was actually an accountant and was</v>

781
00:34:35.870 --> 00:34:39.980
<v Speaker 1>hired to go over the Warren Commission</v>
<v Speaker 1>report and found inconsistency after</v>

782
00:34:39.981 --> 00:34:43.220
<v Speaker 1>inconsistency over and over again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and detailed these in great order.</v>

783
00:34:43.610 --> 00:34:47.960
<v Speaker 1>But the difference in the inconsistency</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the autopsies and consistencies of</v>

784
00:34:48.070 --> 00:34:51.380
<v Speaker 1>the various reports of what went down in</v>
<v Speaker 1>consistencies in the Warren Commission</v>

785
00:34:51.381 --> 00:34:53.600
<v Speaker 1>of their findings that would cancel out</v>
<v Speaker 1>each other's findings.</v>

786
00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:57.320
<v Speaker 1>He was one of the few guys were the</v>
<v Speaker 1>first guys to go through the entire 900</v>

787
00:34:57.321 --> 00:34:58.820
<v Speaker 1>volumes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fascinating.</v>

788
00:34:58.821 --> 00:35:02.660
<v Speaker 1>Fascinating book that I read when I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>living in New Jersey.</v>

789
00:35:02.661 --> 00:35:07.520
<v Speaker 1>I was living in New York rather,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was doing a Gig on the road and I</v>

790
00:35:07.521 --> 00:35:10.040
<v Speaker 1>read it and fucking bombed that night.</v>

791
00:35:10.490 --> 00:35:12.830
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was in my hotel room all day reading</v>

792
00:35:12.831 --> 00:35:16.520
<v Speaker 1>is freaky conspiracy books.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shit in my pants and I was like 23 years</v>

793
00:35:16.521 --> 00:35:18.830
<v Speaker 1>old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I went on stage that night and</v>

794
00:35:18.850 --> 00:35:23.330
<v Speaker 1>just had terrible and I learned a very</v>
<v Speaker 1>valuable lesson from that book.</v>

795
00:35:23.690 --> 00:35:27.830
<v Speaker 1>Don't read or watch depressing shit</v>
<v Speaker 1>right before you go onstage or break</v>

796
00:35:27.831 --> 00:35:30.600
<v Speaker 1>into big conspiracy mongering in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>middle of your set that you just know.</v>

797
00:35:30.690 --> 00:35:33.530
<v Speaker 1>Nobody came to conspiracy freak for sure</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

798
00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:36.320
<v Speaker 1>That book best evidence was what threw</v>
<v Speaker 1>me over the top.</v>

799
00:35:36.350 --> 00:35:36.591
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

800
00:35:36.591 --> 00:35:37.840
<v Speaker 1>I did an episode on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

801
00:35:37.910 --> 00:35:38.070
<v Speaker 1>on</v>

802
00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:42.750
<v Speaker 4>the JFK assassination a about a month or</v>
<v Speaker 4>two ago and I'd been putting it off for</v>

803
00:35:42.751 --> 00:35:47.751
<v Speaker 4>years because there is so much,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so much bs and so much real information</v>

804
00:35:49.261 --> 00:35:51.310
<v Speaker 4>on that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then I found this is,</v>

805
00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:54.000
<v Speaker 4>this is impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How am I going to distill this into a 12</v>

806
00:35:54.001 --> 00:35:56.070
<v Speaker 4>minute show because my son was 12</v>
<v Speaker 4>minutes,</v>

807
00:35:57.420 --> 00:35:59.040
<v Speaker 4>12 minutes long every week.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's insane.</v>

808
00:35:59.041 --> 00:35:59.920
<v Speaker 4>You need to spread out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

809
00:36:00.090 --> 00:36:01.860
<v Speaker 4>So what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

810
00:36:01.861 --> 00:36:04.320
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what I decided to do is not to address</v>

811
00:36:04.410 --> 00:36:09.030
<v Speaker 4>any of the conspiracy theories,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but just talk about why in general,</v>

812
00:36:09.390 --> 00:36:14.390
<v Speaker 4>the conspiracy theories</v>
<v Speaker 4>individual and myriad as they are,</v>

813
00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:17.590
<v Speaker 4>why they don't stand up to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

814
00:36:17.660 --> 00:36:18.570
<v Speaker 4>what's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what we,</v>

815
00:36:19.050 --> 00:36:19.770
<v Speaker 4>what we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

816
00:36:19.770 --> 00:36:22.350
<v Speaker 4>unfortunately called the official story</v>
<v Speaker 4>quote unquote,</v>

817
00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:24.420
<v Speaker 4>kind of a weasel word.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

818
00:36:24.750 --> 00:36:27.210
<v Speaker 4>and it really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the thing is that what all conspiracy</v>

819
00:36:27.211 --> 00:36:32.211
<v Speaker 4>theories have in common is that they are</v>
<v Speaker 4>united only in that they dispute the</v>

820
00:36:33.031 --> 00:36:33.930
<v Speaker 4>official story.</v>

821
00:36:34.290 --> 00:36:36.610
<v Speaker 4>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can say the,</v>

822
00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:40.290
<v Speaker 4>the Cubans Killed Kennedy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or you can say the Russians killed</v>

823
00:36:40.291 --> 00:36:42.510
<v Speaker 4>Kennedy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or you can say the mob killed Kennedy.</v>

824
00:36:42.690 --> 00:36:45.510
<v Speaker 4>Or you can say the secret service men</v>
<v Speaker 4>running alongside,</v>

825
00:36:45.511 --> 00:36:47.460
<v Speaker 4>accidentally shot him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>

826
00:36:47.790 --> 00:36:51.440
<v Speaker 4>And all the people who promote those</v>
<v Speaker 4>conspiracies,</v>

827
00:36:51.570 --> 00:36:54.150
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they consider themselves united as a</v>

828
00:36:54.151 --> 00:36:58.980
<v Speaker 4>group even though their theories are</v>
<v Speaker 4>absolutely factually exclusive of one</v>

829
00:36:58.981 --> 00:37:00.690
<v Speaker 4>another.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Almost like competing religions.</v>

830
00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:01.140
<v Speaker 4>They.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

831
00:37:01.140 --> 00:37:01.811
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>

832
00:37:01.811 --> 00:37:05.880
<v Speaker 4>they cannot possibly be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>be brought together.</v>

833
00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:08.910
<v Speaker 4>The only thing they have in common is</v>
<v Speaker 4>that they simply say the government's</v>

834
00:37:08.911 --> 00:37:11.250
<v Speaker 4>lying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And as long as you say the government's</v>

835
00:37:11.251 --> 00:37:12.120
<v Speaker 4>lying than hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

836
00:37:12.150 --> 00:37:13.230
<v Speaker 4>you're okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're in the club.</v>

837
00:37:13.231 --> 00:37:14.100
<v Speaker 4>Your theories.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All right?</v>

838
00:37:14.310 --> 00:37:17.130
<v Speaker 4>Your theory is more likely that that's</v>
<v Speaker 4>the government to find out.</v>

839
00:37:17.131 --> 00:37:19.020
<v Speaker 4>We're talking about this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

840
00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:20.550
<v Speaker 4>it's happened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's happened.</v>

841
00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:25.890
<v Speaker 4>You right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know Vince Bugliosi his book.</v>

842
00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:28.470
<v Speaker 4>I didn't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What was it called?</v>

843
00:37:28.950 --> 00:37:31.370
<v Speaker 4>Case closed case or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

844
00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:33.660
<v Speaker 4>Was called case closed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He talked about,</v>

845
00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:35.960
<v Speaker 4>I can't remember what it was called,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I'll accept that in us.</v>

846
00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:38.250
<v Speaker 4>We don't have to accept anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is google.</v>

847
00:37:39.750 --> 00:37:43.200
<v Speaker 4>He talked about one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One person that he interviewed who</v>

848
00:37:43.230 --> 00:37:45.060
<v Speaker 4>believed posner too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sterile pose.</v>

849
00:37:45.061 --> 00:37:46.470
<v Speaker 4>Nurse case closed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

850
00:37:46.650 --> 00:37:48.690
<v Speaker 4>He believes one person he interviewed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

851
00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:53.960
<v Speaker 4>believed that Kennedy was still alive</v>
<v Speaker 4>and likely and that he had committed</v>

852
00:37:54.931 --> 00:37:56.280
<v Speaker 4>suicide.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

853
00:37:56.281 --> 00:37:57.390
<v Speaker 4>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I heard the,</v>

854
00:37:57.980 --> 00:38:00.720
<v Speaker 4>the secret service man shot him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I heard A.</v>

855
00:38:00.721 --> 00:38:03.060
<v Speaker 4>I heard like you could see him shoot him</v>
<v Speaker 4>on the,</v>

856
00:38:03.061 --> 00:38:04.410
<v Speaker 4>on the video for that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

857
00:38:04.420 --> 00:38:05.770
<v Speaker 4>The driver shot him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

858
00:38:05.771 --> 00:38:07.040
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The driver turned around.</v>

859
00:38:08.180 --> 00:38:10.770
<v Speaker 4>So even,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even having,</v>

860
00:38:10.771 --> 00:38:15.270
<v Speaker 4>even even one person having their own</v>
<v Speaker 4>belief that is self contradictory seems</v>

861
00:38:15.271 --> 00:38:20.271
<v Speaker 4>more likely than believing what the</v>
<v Speaker 4>government says and the government</v>

862
00:38:21.180 --> 00:38:24.660
<v Speaker 4>obviously is not perfect,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you can't.</v>

863
00:38:24.780 --> 00:38:28.080
<v Speaker 4>You cannot say that just because the</v>
<v Speaker 4>government agrees with one particular</v>

864
00:38:28.081 --> 00:38:30.960
<v Speaker 4>version of events that that event is</v>
<v Speaker 4>therefore wrong.</v>

865
00:38:31.080 --> 00:38:32.580
<v Speaker 4>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's a huge,</v>

866
00:38:32.670 --> 00:38:35.860
<v Speaker 4>hugely popular argument that I get</v>
<v Speaker 4>reclaiming history.</v>

867
00:38:36.260 --> 00:38:38.110
<v Speaker 1>Fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't read this.</v>

868
00:38:38.111 --> 00:38:40.780
<v Speaker 1>I read the other one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>

869
00:38:41.020 --> 00:38:43.270
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't disclude the possibility that</v>

870
00:38:43.271 --> 00:38:45.310
<v Speaker 1>there was in fact some sort of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>conspiracy.</v>

871
00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:46.450
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it certainly doesn't,</v>

872
00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:49.630
<v Speaker 1>but the fact that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the government found one version of</v>

873
00:38:49.631 --> 00:38:53.530
<v Speaker 1>the events more compelling and wrote</v>
<v Speaker 1>their official version on that doesn't</v>

874
00:38:53.531 --> 00:38:54.970
<v Speaker 1>make that version of wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>

875
00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:57.520
<v Speaker 1>And that's the hardest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the hardest point to communicate</v>

876
00:38:57.521 --> 00:38:59.440
<v Speaker 1>to the people who believe that it</v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly doesn't.</v>

877
00:38:59.470 --> 00:39:03.040
<v Speaker 1>The inconsistencies that are troubling</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the Warren commissions are part are.</v>

878
00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:05.680
<v Speaker 1>There's several,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one of the big ones is the single</v>

879
00:39:05.681 --> 00:39:07.630
<v Speaker 1>bullet theory or the need for the single</v>
<v Speaker 1>bullet theory.</v>

880
00:39:07.930 --> 00:39:10.930
<v Speaker 1>The reason why they needed to formulate</v>
<v Speaker 1>the single bullet theory is because they</v>

881
00:39:10.931 --> 00:39:14.050
<v Speaker 1>had an account for three shots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had a new bullet that it hit</v>

882
00:39:14.140 --> 00:39:18.310
<v Speaker 1>ricocheted against the curbs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>term kerbstone on under the overpass,</v>

883
00:39:18.311 --> 00:39:20.080
<v Speaker 1>and a guy had gotten hit by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ricochet,</v>

884
00:39:20.260 --> 00:39:23.590
<v Speaker 1>so he was in the hospital and they had</v>
<v Speaker 1>seen the mark on the curb stone,</v>

885
00:39:23.591 --> 00:39:24.880
<v Speaker 1>so they attributed that to a bullet.</v>

886
00:39:25.210 --> 00:39:25.901
<v Speaker 1>So they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

887
00:39:25.901 --> 00:39:29.350
<v Speaker 1>well we know for sure someone was</v>
<v Speaker 1>shooting from the direction the school</v>

888
00:39:29.351 --> 00:39:30.700
<v Speaker 1>book depository.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one thing.</v>

889
00:39:30.701 --> 00:39:34.990
<v Speaker 1>Then that confirmed actually supporting</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea that Oswaldo did it or that</v>

890
00:39:34.991 --> 00:39:37.990
<v Speaker 1>someone in Oswald's position did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So bullet did come from there,</v>

891
00:39:38.170 --> 00:39:41.170
<v Speaker 1>but now they had to account for all</v>
<v Speaker 1>these wounds and so how did they do</v>

892
00:39:41.171 --> 00:39:41.671
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

893
00:39:41.671 --> 00:39:42.461
<v Speaker 1>instead of saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

894
00:39:42.461 --> 00:39:45.550
<v Speaker 1>maybe there was more than one bullet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe there was more than three shots.</v>

895
00:39:45.551 --> 00:39:47.620
<v Speaker 1>Maybe there was more than two people</v>
<v Speaker 1>shooting.</v>

896
00:39:47.890 --> 00:39:51.700
<v Speaker 1>They had to come up with some sort of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>reason why one bullet could do all this</v>

897
00:39:51.701 --> 00:39:55.570
<v Speaker 1>damage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That to me seems a much less likely</v>

898
00:39:55.571 --> 00:39:57.850
<v Speaker 1>scenario.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then there's more than one shooter.</v>

899
00:39:58.150 --> 00:40:00.190
<v Speaker 1>The more than one shooter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to kill the fucking</v>

900
00:40:00.191 --> 00:40:03.910
<v Speaker 1>president and if there is a conspiracy</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we haven't proven that there's not</v>

901
00:40:03.940 --> 00:40:06.400
<v Speaker 1>more that there is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if there's going to be a conspiracy,</v>

902
00:40:06.401 --> 00:40:10.000
<v Speaker 1>I would doubt you would give it to one</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy named Lee Harvey Oswald,</v>

903
00:40:10.270 --> 00:40:13.720
<v Speaker 1>one guy and give them a rifle that's not</v>
<v Speaker 1>even that fucking good and put them in a</v>

904
00:40:13.721 --> 00:40:17.200
<v Speaker 1>window and given this crazy shot that</v>
<v Speaker 1>most people are not going to make.</v>

905
00:40:17.410 --> 00:40:19.660
<v Speaker 1>That's not a good shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you've ever shot at something.</v>

906
00:40:19.870 --> 00:40:23.110
<v Speaker 1>Moving targets are incredibly difficult</v>
<v Speaker 1>and moving targets.</v>

907
00:40:23.111 --> 00:40:25.780
<v Speaker 1>When you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have this shitty bolt action rifle</v>

908
00:40:25.870 --> 00:40:28.690
<v Speaker 1>and you got to reload it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a long time to do that.</v>

909
00:40:28.691 --> 00:40:31.180
<v Speaker 1>You can get it off if you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

910
00:40:31.181 --> 00:40:34.360
<v Speaker 1>I've seen the people that have pulled it</v>
<v Speaker 1>off in a test where they've said try to</v>

911
00:40:34.361 --> 00:40:38.410
<v Speaker 1>reproduce it and they can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can get those shots off and you can</v>

912
00:40:38.411 --> 00:40:39.850
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're not going to be accurate.</v>

913
00:40:39.910 --> 00:40:41.650
<v Speaker 1>You need a couple of seconds to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>accurate.</v>

914
00:40:41.651 --> 00:40:43.630
<v Speaker 1>You need your fucking shooting the</v>
<v Speaker 1>president.</v>

915
00:40:43.750 --> 00:40:47.470
<v Speaker 1>This is not some low pressure situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the first person you've ever</v>

916
00:40:47.471 --> 00:40:51.970
<v Speaker 1>assassinated with a rifle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My position is that it's more likely</v>

917
00:40:51.971 --> 00:40:56.170
<v Speaker 1>that they had a predetermined outcome</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they were trying to reach that</v>

918
00:40:56.171 --> 00:41:01.171
<v Speaker 1>outcome is that they wanted to tie up</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything with Lee Harvey Oswald and</v>

919
00:41:01.661 --> 00:41:02.650
<v Speaker 1>one of the best ways to do that.</v>

920
00:41:02.650 --> 00:41:04.600
<v Speaker 1>It's an attribute all these different</v>
<v Speaker 1>wounds to one bullet.</v>

921
00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:07.990
<v Speaker 1>Does it mean that all those wounds were</v>
<v Speaker 1>not created by one bullet?</v>

922
00:41:08.260 --> 00:41:09.850
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's one of the weird things</v>

923
00:41:09.851 --> 00:41:13.540
<v Speaker 1>that happens when you shoot things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things hit bone and they ricochet and</v>

924
00:41:13.541 --> 00:41:17.260
<v Speaker 1>they go weird directions and strange</v>
<v Speaker 1>anomalies happen to bullets where a</v>

925
00:41:17.261 --> 00:41:19.060
<v Speaker 1>bullet will kill someone and you'll look</v>
<v Speaker 1>at it.</v>

926
00:41:19.061 --> 00:41:21.190
<v Speaker 1>It looks like it's virtually</v>
<v Speaker 1>undisturbed.</v>

927
00:41:21.490 --> 00:41:26.200
<v Speaker 1>Every now and then shit gets weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for the most part when a bullet goes</v>

928
00:41:26.201 --> 00:41:28.480
<v Speaker 1>through to people and shatters bone and</v>
<v Speaker 1>both of them,</v>

929
00:41:28.481 --> 00:41:31.210
<v Speaker 1>especially the risk of connolly on the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the end of it,</v>

930
00:41:31.330 --> 00:41:36.140
<v Speaker 1>and then winds up in the Gurney in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>pristine form like the single bullet</v>

931
00:41:36.141 --> 00:41:39.080
<v Speaker 1>theory did when they found that bullet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's unlikely.</v>

932
00:41:39.540 --> 00:41:43.080
<v Speaker 4>I've got A.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've got a 50 caliber round that that we</v>

933
00:41:43.081 --> 00:41:46.980
<v Speaker 4>found in death valley leftover from the</v>
<v Speaker 4>days when they would do fighter planes</v>

934
00:41:47.390 --> 00:41:51.830
<v Speaker 4>just shooting their machine guns over</v>
<v Speaker 4>from China Lake and what what it.</v>

935
00:41:51.870 --> 00:41:55.410
<v Speaker 4>What it is is I'm a completely</v>
<v Speaker 4>flattened,</v>

936
00:41:55.411 --> 00:42:00.060
<v Speaker 4>smudged,</v>
<v Speaker 4>irreconcilable piece of copper and</v>

937
00:42:00.180 --> 00:42:05.180
<v Speaker 4>protruding out from the center of it is</v>
<v Speaker 4>this absolutely pristine tungsten</v>

938
00:42:07.240 --> 00:42:10.920
<v Speaker 4>missile that looks like it's fresh from</v>
<v Speaker 4>the factory,</v>

939
00:42:10.980 --> 00:42:13.200
<v Speaker 4>absolutely sharp,</v>
<v Speaker 4>completely undamaged,</v>

940
00:42:13.470 --> 00:42:15.720
<v Speaker 4>and it's inside this copper jacket that</v>
<v Speaker 4>is.</v>

941
00:42:16.110 --> 00:42:18.660
<v Speaker 4>That's been peeled what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Peeled away from it and completely</v>

942
00:42:18.661 --> 00:42:22.510
<v Speaker 4>smashed out to to unrecognizable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's real effect.</v>

943
00:42:22.590 --> 00:42:23.730
<v Speaker 4>When I found it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're looking at going,</v>

944
00:42:23.731 --> 00:42:26.730
<v Speaker 4>what the heck is this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is this a bullet that somebody shot into</v>

945
00:42:26.731 --> 00:42:28.240
<v Speaker 4>something and it's still hanging on?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

946
00:42:28.260 --> 00:42:31.620
<v Speaker 4>so I understand what a really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really weird stuff can go on with</v>

947
00:42:31.621 --> 00:42:33.420
<v Speaker 4>bullets.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Weird stuff can go on with bullets.</v>

948
00:42:33.421 --> 00:42:35.220
<v Speaker 4>One of my favorite paper,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I have to talk about it.</v>

949
00:42:35.450 --> 00:42:36.201
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a,</v>

950
00:42:36.201 --> 00:42:38.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm really getting into ballistics</v>

951
00:42:38.661 --> 00:42:40.160
<v Speaker 1>lately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been doing a lot of target shooting</v>

952
00:42:40.161 --> 00:42:42.500
<v Speaker 1>and talking to a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a very good friend,</v>

953
00:42:42.501 --> 00:42:46.820
<v Speaker 1>my friend Justin who is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a complete gun nut and if I have any</v>

954
00:42:46.821 --> 00:42:49.280
<v Speaker 1>questions about ballistics and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and things,</v>

955
00:42:49.430 --> 00:42:51.300
<v Speaker 1>I will talk to him about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

956
00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:53.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'll tell you like weird shit happens</v>

957
00:42:53.450 --> 00:42:56.180
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you shoot a person and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>bullet will come back at you through</v>

958
00:42:56.181 --> 00:42:57.170
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>

959
00:42:57.171 --> 00:42:59.390
<v Speaker 1>that's happened to guys like guys and</v>
<v Speaker 1>special forces.</v>

960
00:42:59.630 --> 00:43:03.770
<v Speaker 1>They've assassinated somebody or killed</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody and the bullet hits bone and</v>

961
00:43:03.771 --> 00:43:05.930
<v Speaker 1>somehow or another figures out a way to</v>
<v Speaker 1>pop out of their eye,</v>

962
00:43:06.380 --> 00:43:07.720
<v Speaker 4>like slides around the inside of the.</v>

963
00:43:08.130 --> 00:43:11.050
<v Speaker 1>Somebody's trying other somehow or</v>
<v Speaker 1>another ricochets in.</v>

964
00:43:11.350 --> 00:43:12.920
<v Speaker 1>Well there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

965
00:43:13.100 --> 00:43:15.920
<v Speaker 1>there's random weird shit that can</v>
<v Speaker 1>happen when you shoot people.</v>

966
00:43:15.950 --> 00:43:19.430
<v Speaker 1>So is it possible that a bullet went to</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kennedy and then went into connolly?</v>

967
00:43:19.490 --> 00:43:21.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One hundred percent weird shit happens,</v>

968
00:43:22.010 --> 00:43:23.780
<v Speaker 1>but does it look like that bullet did</v>
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

969
00:43:23.900 --> 00:43:25.100
<v Speaker 1>Not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

970
00:43:25.101 --> 00:43:27.440
<v Speaker 1>It looks like that bullet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They fired into a tank of water.</v>

971
00:43:27.680 --> 00:43:30.980
<v Speaker 1>That bullet doesn't look like it hit</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything because it's a lead bullet</v>

972
00:43:30.981 --> 00:43:33.490
<v Speaker 1>that's jacketed and the jacket isn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>bent.</v>

973
00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:36.260
<v Speaker 1>It's not disturbed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to my knowledge,</v>

974
00:43:36.530 --> 00:43:39.410
<v Speaker 1>people have tried to recreate that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know Penn and teller tried to do it.</v>

975
00:43:39.411 --> 00:43:42.110
<v Speaker 1>I think miss mythbusters tried to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They weren't able to do it.</v>

976
00:43:42.111 --> 00:43:43.520
<v Speaker 1>When they hit bone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were only able to do.</v>

977
00:43:43.521 --> 00:43:46.730
<v Speaker 1>If they pass just through the flesh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can pass through flash and leave a</v>

978
00:43:46.731 --> 00:43:50.150
<v Speaker 1>bullet relatively undisturbed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you hit bone and you shatter that</v>

979
00:43:50.151 --> 00:43:52.010
<v Speaker 1>bone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most likely you're making a mess out of</v>

980
00:43:52.011 --> 00:43:52.520
<v Speaker 1>that bullet.</v>

981
00:43:52.520 --> 00:43:54.800
<v Speaker 1>Didn't they find pieces in the body</v>
<v Speaker 1>also?</v>

982
00:43:54.801 --> 00:43:57.830
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In pieces in Connolly's wrist that did</v>

983
00:43:57.831 --> 00:43:59.600
<v Speaker 1>not match what was missing from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>bullet.</v>

984
00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:01.310
<v Speaker 1>There was more pieces in connally's</v>
<v Speaker 1>body.</v>

985
00:44:01.311 --> 00:44:03.890
<v Speaker 1>Then we're missing from the bullet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does that mean that he didn't get hit</v>

986
00:44:03.891 --> 00:44:04.724
<v Speaker 1>with some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

987
00:44:04.790 --> 00:44:08.390
<v Speaker 1>random shrapnel and bullets are fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>flying and weird shit happens and you</v>

988
00:44:08.391 --> 00:44:09.860
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of weird shit that goes on</v>

989
00:44:09.861 --> 00:44:12.170
<v Speaker 1>when you're in a gunfight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think you would probably have to</v>

990
00:44:12.171 --> 00:44:13.640
<v Speaker 1>attribute that to more than three</v>
<v Speaker 1>bullets.</v>

991
00:44:14.390 --> 00:44:17.720
<v Speaker 1>Aliens in Roswell never said that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

992
00:44:17.721 --> 00:44:22.721
<v Speaker 1>have a joke goofing on it on my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on my comedy special from 1999 where I</v>

993
00:44:25.641 --> 00:44:27.100
<v Speaker 1>say that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

994
00:44:27.540 --> 00:44:30.110
<v Speaker 1>that people say the government actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>printed in the paper.</v>

995
00:44:30.111 --> 00:44:34.320
<v Speaker 1>They have recovered a crashed Ufo and</v>
<v Speaker 1>alien bodies and the next day they made</v>

996
00:44:34.321 --> 00:44:35.240
<v Speaker 1>a mistake up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

997
00:44:35.250 --> 00:44:36.090
<v Speaker 1>It was just a weather balloon.</v>

998
00:44:36.330 --> 00:44:36.631
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

999
00:44:36.631 --> 00:44:38.640
<v Speaker 1>what about the aliens?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are Mexicans.</v>

1000
00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:40.890
<v Speaker 1>Apparently they were on the balloon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were drinking,</v>

1001
00:44:40.891 --> 00:44:43.380
<v Speaker 1>some shenanigans took place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They mistook the balloon for opinion.</v>

1002
00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:45.390
<v Speaker 1>It's very tragic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1003
00:44:45.420 --> 00:44:48.660
<v Speaker 1>I never said that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that what I did say that is</v>

1004
00:44:48.900 --> 00:44:52.380
<v Speaker 1>absolutely fascinating and fun thing to</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about.</v>

1005
00:44:52.620 --> 00:44:56.310
<v Speaker 1>The fact that they could have found some</v>
<v Speaker 1>crashed ufo from another planet and</v>

1006
00:44:56.320 --> 00:45:00.270
<v Speaker 1>hushed everybody up and hit these bodies</v>
<v Speaker 1>and little child's coffins run away with</v>

1007
00:45:00.271 --> 00:45:02.790
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but everybody that I've talked to that</v>

1008
00:45:02.791 --> 00:45:07.410
<v Speaker 1>has ever told me a story about being</v>
<v Speaker 1>abducted by Ufos are taken aboard a</v>

1009
00:45:07.411 --> 00:45:12.411
<v Speaker 1>craft or any of their fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the one thing they all share.</v>

1010
00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:16.830
<v Speaker 1>They all share this nutty disconnect</v>
<v Speaker 1>with reality.</v>

1011
00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:20.280
<v Speaker 1>I've talked to people that have told me</v>
<v Speaker 1>some weird things about animals.</v>

1012
00:45:20.340 --> 00:45:23.070
<v Speaker 1>I talked to a woman that was very</v>
<v Speaker 1>convincing that told me she had a</v>

1013
00:45:23.071 --> 00:45:25.110
<v Speaker 1>bigfoot sighting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very convincing,</v>

1014
00:45:25.350 --> 00:45:26.130
<v Speaker 1>less shroud.</v>

1015
00:45:26.130 --> 00:45:30.090
<v Speaker 1>Who's the survivor man told me some</v>
<v Speaker 1>animal was by beetles running through</v>

1016
00:45:30.091 --> 00:45:33.360
<v Speaker 1>the woods and that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as far as you iphones,</v>

1017
00:45:33.420 --> 00:45:38.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm still waiting for the one guy who</v>
<v Speaker 1>tells me anything that makes sense.</v>

1018
00:45:38.550 --> 00:45:42.960
<v Speaker 1>I got in a hundred arguments with people</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was filming the Scifi show that</v>

1019
00:45:42.961 --> 00:45:45.240
<v Speaker 1>were believers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I was asking them for evidence.</v>

1020
00:45:45.241 --> 00:45:45.661
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1021
00:45:45.661 --> 00:45:48.270
<v Speaker 1>where's the evidence?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we have sworn affidavits.</v>

1022
00:45:48.271 --> 00:45:49.770
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not evidence.</v>

1023
00:45:49.950 --> 00:45:50.521
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>

1024
00:45:50.521 --> 00:45:52.050
<v Speaker 1>that is evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's evidence in a court of law.</v>

1025
00:45:52.051 --> 00:45:53.970
<v Speaker 1>You can convict people for murder unless</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

1026
00:45:53.971 --> 00:45:55.280
<v Speaker 1>that's not scientific evidence like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1027
00:45:55.290 --> 00:45:57.570
<v Speaker 1>you have a story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all you have is a story.</v>

1028
00:45:57.900 --> 00:46:00.240
<v Speaker 1>Nobody wants there to be aliens more</v>
<v Speaker 1>than me,</v>

1029
00:46:00.450 --> 00:46:04.800
<v Speaker 1>but all I see when I go looking for</v>
<v Speaker 1>aliens is a bunch of unfuckable white</v>

1030
00:46:04.801 --> 00:46:09.801
<v Speaker 1>dudes with stories about spaceships and</v>
<v Speaker 1>flying saucers and all sorts of things</v>

1031
00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:12.300
<v Speaker 1>that make their regular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mundane,</v>

1032
00:46:12.301 --> 00:46:17.040
<v Speaker 1>boring life seem insignificant because</v>
<v Speaker 1>of this greater threat,</v>

1033
00:46:17.190 --> 00:46:19.620
<v Speaker 1>greater mystery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>greater enigma,</v>

1034
00:46:19.621 --> 00:46:22.440
<v Speaker 1>this huge thing that's going on where we</v>
<v Speaker 1>being observed by aliens.</v>

1035
00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:26.340
<v Speaker 1>It adds this excitement to an otherwise</v>
<v Speaker 1>mundane life.</v>

1036
00:46:26.460 --> 00:46:27.960
<v Speaker 1>And does that mean that there are no</v>
<v Speaker 1>aliens?</v>

1037
00:46:27.961 --> 00:46:30.000
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does it mean that aliens aren't</v>

1038
00:46:30.001 --> 00:46:31.950
<v Speaker 1>observing us?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely not,</v>

1039
00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:36.270
<v Speaker 1>but it does mean is that the consistency</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I've found in talking to people</v>

1040
00:46:36.271 --> 00:46:39.750
<v Speaker 1>that claimed to vet alien experiences</v>
<v Speaker 1>make me think that the aliens are so</v>

1041
00:46:39.751 --> 00:46:42.030
<v Speaker 1>intelligent that they only picked</v>
<v Speaker 1>dummies.</v>

1042
00:46:42.660 --> 00:46:45.780
<v Speaker 1>They're so intelligent that they pick</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that were easily discounted.</v>

1043
00:46:46.080 --> 00:46:48.060
<v Speaker 1>So you listened to their stories and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go ahead.</v>

1044
00:46:48.360 --> 00:46:49.890
<v Speaker 1>Tell somebody who the fuck is going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe you.</v>

1045
00:46:49.891 --> 00:46:52.110
<v Speaker 1>You're crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they find people that have a problem</v>

1046
00:46:52.111 --> 00:46:54.460
<v Speaker 1>with the truth and then abduct them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

1047
00:46:54.720 --> 00:46:57.530
<v Speaker 1>that's the only thing that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How would you call your.</v>

1048
00:46:57.570 --> 00:46:59.370
<v Speaker 1>Would you describe yourself as a science</v>
<v Speaker 1>advocate?</v>

1049
00:46:59.820 --> 00:47:01.170
<v Speaker 1>One hundred percent?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1050
00:47:01.260 --> 00:47:04.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm a huge fan of science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the things that I forgot to</v>

1051
00:47:04.201 --> 00:47:06.750
<v Speaker 1>argue with Stefan Molyneux when he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the podcast recently.</v>

1052
00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:10.110
<v Speaker 1>Not argued,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he argues against funding,</v>

1053
00:47:10.140 --> 00:47:12.080
<v Speaker 1>scientific research and space</v>
<v Speaker 1>exploration.</v>

1054
00:47:12.081 --> 00:47:15.870
<v Speaker 1>And to me it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it fuels my day if I get up in the</v>

1055
00:47:15.871 --> 00:47:18.570
<v Speaker 1>morning and I read about some new thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're doing where,</v>

1056
00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:22.380
<v Speaker 1>I mean even I've been following this</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea of putting a man mission on Mars</v>

1057
00:47:22.381 --> 00:47:24.870
<v Speaker 1>and these people that are going to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to go there on is one way trip and my</v>

1058
00:47:24.900 --> 00:47:26.890
<v Speaker 1>fucking hands sweat just thinking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1059
00:47:27.180 --> 00:47:30.070
<v Speaker 1>Those things fuel my day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm by science,</v>

1060
00:47:30.340 --> 00:47:31.960
<v Speaker 2>absolutely fascinated by science.</v>

1061
00:47:33.050 --> 00:47:35.580
<v Speaker 4>I the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the thing that I love,</v>

1062
00:47:35.660 --> 00:47:36.870
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1063
00:47:37.150 --> 00:47:38.820
<v Speaker 4>doing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>doing the scaphoid episodes,</v>

1064
00:47:38.821 --> 00:47:43.821
<v Speaker 4>my favorite part of it is solving the</v>
<v Speaker 4>mysteries that people usually leave</v>

1065
00:47:45.810 --> 00:47:48.870
<v Speaker 4>unsolved because they stop at the</v>
<v Speaker 4>paranormal explanation.</v>

1066
00:47:49.140 --> 00:47:51.770
<v Speaker 4>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the whole Williamson Roswell,</v>

1067
00:47:51.840 --> 00:47:55.800
<v Speaker 4>take that as an example.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you take the national enquirer</v>

1068
00:47:55.801 --> 00:47:59.010
<v Speaker 4>version of events,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's sensational and it's fun.</v>

1069
00:47:59.011 --> 00:48:00.690
<v Speaker 4>Aliens are here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>aliens or visiting us,</v>

1070
00:48:00.691 --> 00:48:02.490
<v Speaker 4>the government's coming here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's got all of that,</v>

1071
00:48:02.730 --> 00:48:05.070
<v Speaker 4>all the compelling qualities of a story</v>
<v Speaker 4>that we love,</v>

1072
00:48:05.071 --> 00:48:08.760
<v Speaker 4>but the fact is that those people</v>
<v Speaker 4>haven't solved the mystery and what I</v>

1073
00:48:08.761 --> 00:48:13.040
<v Speaker 4>enjoy most is completing the process,</v>
<v Speaker 4>going all the way through it actually,</v>

1074
00:48:13.220 --> 00:48:15.780
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>actually finding the pot of gold at the</v>

1075
00:48:15.780 --> 00:48:17.520
<v Speaker 4>end of the rainbow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Actually finding the solution to what</v>

1076
00:48:17.521 --> 00:48:18.080
<v Speaker 4>happened</v>

1077
00:48:18.080 --> 00:48:20.390
<v Speaker 2>whenever possible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well isn't what makes it exciting to</v>

1078
00:48:20.391 --> 00:48:23.090
<v Speaker 2>these people that you never really can</v>
<v Speaker 2>do that unless you can get a time</v>

1079
00:48:23.091 --> 00:48:25.640
<v Speaker 2>machine and go back to Roswell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>New Mexico in 1940.</v>

1080
00:48:25.641 --> 00:48:26.390
<v Speaker 2>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seven?</v>

1081
00:48:26.390 --> 00:48:27.223
<v Speaker 2>Was it seven,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nine,</v>

1082
00:48:27.240 --> 00:48:30.080
<v Speaker 2>47 years?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have the actual front page of the</v>

1083
00:48:30.081 --> 00:48:33.170
<v Speaker 2>Roswell daily record on my home framed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1084
00:48:33.171 --> 00:48:34.400
<v Speaker 2>do you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very cool.</v>

1085
00:48:34.430 --> 00:48:36.740
<v Speaker 2>It's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's also fascinating historically,</v>

1086
00:48:36.741 --> 00:48:38.930
<v Speaker 2>just to look at all the other things</v>
<v Speaker 2>that were in the news that were stories</v>

1087
00:48:38.931 --> 00:48:41.240
<v Speaker 2>and try to picture yourself living at</v>
<v Speaker 2>this time,</v>

1088
00:48:41.241 --> 00:48:43.880
<v Speaker 2>and I'll 70 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's weird 77 years ago,</v>

1089
00:48:43.881 --> 00:48:48.881
<v Speaker 2>but the other thing that's weird about</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is that you can't go back so you</v>

1090
00:48:49.071 --> 00:48:51.290
<v Speaker 2>can't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got a bunch of different people and</v>

1091
00:48:51.291 --> 00:48:55.370
<v Speaker 2>some of them tell you they saw aliens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone tell you to say bodies and Max</v>

1092
00:48:55.370 --> 00:48:56.150
<v Speaker 2>Roswell's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maxwell,</v>

1093
00:48:56.150 --> 00:48:57.530
<v Speaker 2>Brazel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever the fuck his name was,</v>

1094
00:48:57.531 --> 00:49:00.380
<v Speaker 2>swingers and all these different people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you'd see the press conference</v>

1095
00:49:00.381 --> 00:49:02.180
<v Speaker 2>where they have this to look.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just this stuff,</v>

1096
00:49:02.210 --> 00:49:05.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so delicious to think in terms of</v>

1097
00:49:05.451 --> 00:49:09.860
<v Speaker 2>conspiracy to think in terms that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>government has this unbelievable magical</v>

1098
00:49:09.861 --> 00:49:12.590
<v Speaker 2>information that they're not sharing</v>
<v Speaker 2>with us because they don't think that we</v>

1099
00:49:12.591 --> 00:49:17.591
<v Speaker 2>can handle it and it becomes this thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>that makes every average everyday life</v>

1100
00:49:17.721 --> 00:49:18.554
<v Speaker 2>more exciting.</v>

1101
00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:23.960
<v Speaker 4>And in on that same vein in the question</v>
<v Speaker 4>of going all the way back to building</v>

1102
00:49:25.771 --> 00:49:26.820
<v Speaker 4>seven,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for example.</v>

1103
00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:29.220
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to me,</v>

1104
00:49:30.480 --> 00:49:31.920
<v Speaker 4>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say,</v>

1105
00:49:31.921 --> 00:49:34.650
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it is an open question,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but let's say the open question of</v>

1106
00:49:34.651 --> 00:49:36.110
<v Speaker 4>whether it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>

1107
00:49:36.260 --> 00:49:39.390
<v Speaker 4>a government conspiracy or not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say we're just going to leave that</v>

1108
00:49:39.391 --> 00:49:40.224
<v Speaker 4>unsettled.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1109
00:49:40.320 --> 00:49:41.153
<v Speaker 4>We don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe,</v>

1110
00:49:41.310 --> 00:49:42.210
<v Speaker 4>maybe it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe it wasn't,</v>

1111
00:49:42.690 --> 00:49:46.980
<v Speaker 4>but to me what's really interesting</v>
<v Speaker 4>about that is the underlying science is</v>

1112
00:49:46.981 --> 00:49:51.330
<v Speaker 4>how would a building made of steel and</v>
<v Speaker 4>covered with concrete or whatever it was</v>

1113
00:49:51.331 --> 00:49:53.250
<v Speaker 4>made of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how would that melt,</v>

1114
00:49:53.310 --> 00:49:57.900
<v Speaker 4>why would it collapse and understanding</v>
<v Speaker 4>the actual scientists to me,</v>

1115
00:49:58.440 --> 00:50:02.300
<v Speaker 4>far more interesting than simply doing</v>
<v Speaker 4>this anomaly hunting that,</v>

1116
00:50:02.340 --> 00:50:06.390
<v Speaker 4>that is so much more popular and trying</v>
<v Speaker 4>to point fingers and turn it into a</v>

1117
00:50:06.391 --> 00:50:08.040
<v Speaker 4>whole political,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ideological thing.</v>

1118
00:50:08.130 --> 00:50:09.660
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is your background?</v>

1119
00:50:09.661 --> 00:50:10.950
<v Speaker 4>What is your education?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

1120
00:50:10.960 --> 00:50:11.670
<v Speaker 4>my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my back,</v>

1121
00:50:11.670 --> 00:50:13.710
<v Speaker 4>my background is in computer science</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

1122
00:50:13.711 --> 00:50:14.261
<v Speaker 4>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1123
00:50:14.261 --> 00:50:16.230
<v Speaker 4>I never,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I never really worked in the field.</v>

1124
00:50:16.231 --> 00:50:17.890
<v Speaker 4>I was um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1125
00:50:18.240 --> 00:50:22.740
<v Speaker 4>I did software consulting basically for</v>
<v Speaker 4>most of my career until I became a</v>

1126
00:50:22.741 --> 00:50:25.050
<v Speaker 4>science writer about the six,</v>
<v Speaker 4>seven years ago.</v>

1127
00:50:25.110 --> 00:50:29.150
<v Speaker 4>How would you feel if someone with no</v>
<v Speaker 4>software knowledge whatsoever started</v>

1128
00:50:29.151 --> 00:50:31.760
<v Speaker 4>criticizing software development that</v>
<v Speaker 4>you were involved with?</v>

1129
00:50:31.761 --> 00:50:33.080
<v Speaker 4>If they were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>say like an architect?</v>

1130
00:50:36.110 --> 00:50:37.580
<v Speaker 4>Since I was always really bad at it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I</v>

1131
00:50:40.890 --> 00:50:44.120
<v Speaker 4>know I would say just as you expect,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd say,</v>

1132
00:50:44.121 --> 00:50:46.760
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I probably know better than you do right</v>

1133
00:50:46.820 --> 00:50:48.890
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you see architects and engineers</v>

1134
00:50:48.891 --> 00:50:51.410
<v Speaker 4>for nine slash 11 truth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you see this group of people,</v>

1135
00:50:51.620 --> 00:50:54.110
<v Speaker 4>how many architects are involved?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Brian Google that shit.</v>

1136
00:50:54.380 --> 00:50:55.850
<v Speaker 4>Architects and engineers from nine slash</v>
<v Speaker 4>seven.</v>

1137
00:50:55.851 --> 00:50:57.440
<v Speaker 4>Truth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a substantial number of people,</v>

1138
00:50:57.610 --> 00:51:01.400
<v Speaker 4>but unfortunately it's something of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>people who actually are in that field</v>

1139
00:51:01.401 --> 00:51:03.110
<v Speaker 4>and most of them are not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1140
00:51:03.140 --> 00:51:07.010
<v Speaker 4>it's a tiny fraction of a percentage of</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the people who work in that period</v>

1141
00:51:07.011 --> 00:51:07.844
<v Speaker 4>overall.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1142
00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:10.850
<v Speaker 4>So if you're trying to look at what most</v>
<v Speaker 4>architects and engineers say,</v>

1143
00:51:10.851 --> 00:51:13.520
<v Speaker 4>overwhelmingly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have no problem with quote unquote</v>

1144
00:51:13.570 --> 00:51:14.870
<v Speaker 4>theater,</v>
<v Speaker 4>honestly,</v>

1145
00:51:14.871 --> 00:51:16.570
<v Speaker 4>that it's been studied by most</v>

1146
00:51:16.630 --> 00:51:18.250
<v Speaker 1>architects and engineers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

1147
00:51:18.910 --> 00:51:20.410
<v Speaker 1>just for the record,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

1148
00:51:20.411 --> 00:51:22.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe in a conspiracy to for</v>

1149
00:51:22.691 --> 00:51:24.040
<v Speaker 1>nine slash 11.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never have.</v>

1150
00:51:24.041 --> 00:51:25.590
<v Speaker 1>But I'm saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1151
00:51:25.900 --> 00:51:27.930
<v Speaker 1>this is kind of throws in the face of</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you said,</v>

1152
00:51:27.931 --> 00:51:30.460
<v Speaker 1>like these are educated people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were trained as architects and</v>

1153
00:51:30.461 --> 00:51:32.200
<v Speaker 1>engineers and they have this,</v>

1154
00:51:32.200 --> 00:51:37.200
<v Speaker 4>this issue with building 72,000,</v>
<v Speaker 4>134 architects and engineers.</v>

1155
00:51:37.391 --> 00:51:39.160
<v Speaker 4>That's kind of a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I will say this,</v>

1156
00:51:39.220 --> 00:51:44.220
<v Speaker 4>the people who have spent the most time</v>
<v Speaker 4>on the question are overwhelmingly</v>

1157
00:51:44.530 --> 00:51:49.530
<v Speaker 4>believers in the conspiracy of course,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but whereas the causal relationship</v>

1158
00:51:50.351 --> 00:51:53.110
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not that they spent most time</v>

1159
00:51:53.200 --> 00:51:56.740
<v Speaker 4>learned the most information and then</v>
<v Speaker 4>made a rational decision based on what</v>

1160
00:51:56.741 --> 00:51:58.390
<v Speaker 4>they learned.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the other way around.</v>

1161
00:51:58.750 --> 00:52:02.530
<v Speaker 4>They spend time obsessing with it</v>
<v Speaker 4>because they were ideologically married</v>

1162
00:52:02.531 --> 00:52:03.730
<v Speaker 4>to the idea from the very beginning.</v>

1163
00:52:03.970 --> 00:52:07.830
<v Speaker 1>If you say that that dismisses them and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a good thing to say if you try to</v>

1164
00:52:07.831 --> 00:52:09.940
<v Speaker 1>dismiss them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think you know them and I</v>

1165
00:52:09.941 --> 00:52:13.480
<v Speaker 1>don't think you've really examine why</v>
<v Speaker 1>they came to these conclusions or why</v>

1166
00:52:13.481 --> 00:52:16.780
<v Speaker 1>they were interested in interested in</v>
<v Speaker 1>investigating it in the first place.</v>

1167
00:52:16.840 --> 00:52:18.530
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what I do for a living is I talk</v>

1168
00:52:18.531 --> 00:52:20.050
<v Speaker 1>to the stand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand that,</v>

1169
00:52:20.110 --> 00:52:23.320
<v Speaker 1>but what I'm saying is I know you didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>interview 2000 people.</v>

1170
00:52:23.410 --> 00:52:26.290
<v Speaker 1>He didn't ask all those different guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the say that in a blanket general</v>

1171
00:52:26.291 --> 00:52:30.040
<v Speaker 1>statement that this is the reason why</v>
<v Speaker 1>they came to this conspiracy is a little</v>

1172
00:52:30.041 --> 00:52:30.480
<v Speaker 1>disengaged.</v>

1173
00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:34.170
<v Speaker 4>He was absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Generalizations are always wrong.</v>

1174
00:52:35.310 --> 00:52:38.760
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a real issue and I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what we're dealing with here.</v>

1175
00:52:38.761 --> 00:52:42.420
<v Speaker 1>Where you had this reluctance to accept</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that I wasn't saying that nine</v>

1176
00:52:42.421 --> 00:52:45.330
<v Speaker 1>slash 11 was an inside job just because</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was saying tower seven looks like a</v>

1177
00:52:45.331 --> 00:52:46.470
<v Speaker 1>demolition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the same thing.</v>

1178
00:52:46.480 --> 00:52:49.650
<v Speaker 1>Like if I listened to this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would think that you're trying to</v>

1179
00:52:49.651 --> 00:52:50.490
<v Speaker 1>convince it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1180
00:52:50.730 --> 00:52:51.780
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>

1181
00:52:51.810 --> 00:52:54.720
<v Speaker 1>It's not a black and white issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of weirdness.</v>

1182
00:52:54.840 --> 00:52:57.600
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of weirdness in the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's a lot of weirdness and</v>

1183
00:52:57.601 --> 00:52:59.940
<v Speaker 1>perception.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of weirdness in people</v>

1184
00:52:59.941 --> 00:53:02.040
<v Speaker 1>that are educated but are also</v>
<v Speaker 1>incorrect.</v>

1185
00:53:02.041 --> 00:53:04.380
<v Speaker 1>It's a common thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It happens all the time and you're</v>

1186
00:53:04.381 --> 00:53:09.381
<v Speaker 1>absolutely correct at 2000 people out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>what number of vast number of architects</v>

1187
00:53:09.781 --> 00:53:13.140
<v Speaker 1>and engineers there exists in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the real question is how many of</v>

1188
00:53:13.141 --> 00:53:16.050
<v Speaker 1>those other people that exist have</v>
<v Speaker 1>examined this as thoroughly as these</v>

1189
00:53:16.051 --> 00:53:18.270
<v Speaker 1>people and you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ones that would examine it,</v>

1190
00:53:18.271 --> 00:53:20.520
<v Speaker 1>the ones who are looking to find some</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of conspiracy,</v>

1191
00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:23.010
<v Speaker 1>does that mean they're wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1192
00:53:23.070 --> 00:53:25.410
<v Speaker 1>in this case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you and I both believe that they're</v>

1193
00:53:25.411 --> 00:53:27.360
<v Speaker 1>wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't mean they're wrong.</v>

1194
00:53:27.550 --> 00:53:28.070
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's.</v>

1195
00:53:28.070 --> 00:53:30.940
<v Speaker 4>There's not a lot of people</v>
<v Speaker 4>realistically who work in the field of</v>

1196
00:53:30.941 --> 00:53:34.330
<v Speaker 4>failure analysis for building structure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but those who do,</v>

1197
00:53:35.920 --> 00:53:38.710
<v Speaker 4>my guess is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and people can call in and tell me I'm</v>

1198
00:53:38.711 --> 00:53:39.940
<v Speaker 4>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Shouldn't no one can call in.</v>

1199
00:53:39.970 --> 00:53:41.630
<v Speaker 4>We shouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not good.</v>

1200
00:53:41.640 --> 00:53:42.380
<v Speaker 4>That's my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my.</v>

1201
00:53:42.380 --> 00:53:47.350
<v Speaker 4>My supposition is that is that the</v>
<v Speaker 4>people who work in building analysis,</v>

1202
00:53:47.400 --> 00:53:51.230
<v Speaker 4>failure analysis of buildings had no</v>
<v Speaker 4>problem with what they saw happening on</v>

1203
00:53:51.240 --> 00:53:52.720
<v Speaker 4>telly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't guess that that's going to go</v>

1204
00:53:52.721 --> 00:53:54.550
<v Speaker 4>on Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They didn't need to.</v>

1205
00:53:54.650 --> 00:53:55.770
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I mean it's,</v>

1206
00:53:55.850 --> 00:53:59.380
<v Speaker 4>it's clear if you just watch any</v>
<v Speaker 4>documentary on the,</v>

1207
00:53:59.440 --> 00:54:01.720
<v Speaker 4>on how the structure collapsed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1208
00:54:01.721 --> 00:54:02.660
<v Speaker 4>if those people that</v>

1209
00:54:02.710 --> 00:54:06.280
<v Speaker 1>believe in the engineers and architects</v>
<v Speaker 1>for nine slash 11 truth created a</v>

1210
00:54:06.281 --> 00:54:09.040
<v Speaker 1>documentary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it would be convincing in the</v>

1211
00:54:09.041 --> 00:54:10.260
<v Speaker 1>other way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

1212
00:54:10.340 --> 00:54:13.010
<v Speaker 1>It really depends on what perspective</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're coming from when you were</v>

1213
00:54:13.690 --> 00:54:18.490
<v Speaker 1>uneducated about the subject as you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I were kind of crazy and making a</v>

1214
00:54:18.491 --> 00:54:19.630
<v Speaker 1>conclusion one way or another.</v>

1215
00:54:20.500 --> 00:54:21.370
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's true.</v>

1216
00:54:21.371 --> 00:54:25.540
<v Speaker 4>But I mean there's a certain amount of</v>
<v Speaker 4>information that's widely available</v>

1217
00:54:25.780 --> 00:54:28.570
<v Speaker 4>about how the building was constructed</v>
<v Speaker 4>according to those guys,</v>

1218
00:54:29.290 --> 00:54:31.150
<v Speaker 4>according to the people who make it</v>
<v Speaker 4>widely available.</v>

1219
00:54:31.210 --> 00:54:32.650
<v Speaker 4>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who really built the building.</v>

1220
00:54:32.680 --> 00:54:34.900
<v Speaker 4>They built those buildings in New York.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a part of the problem.</v>

1221
00:54:34.901 --> 00:54:38.170
<v Speaker 4>They're skimping on the concrete and</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking Joey,</v>

1222
00:54:38.200 --> 00:54:41.410
<v Speaker 4>what's up with this old rebar?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The thing's going to fall down during a</v>

1223
00:54:41.411 --> 00:54:44.550
<v Speaker 4>generalization about New Yorkers here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but my people come.</v>

1224
00:54:44.790 --> 00:54:46.630
<v Speaker 4>The dirt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She stay down.</v>

1225
00:54:47.510 --> 00:54:48.343
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I</v>

1226
00:54:49.420 --> 00:54:52.820
<v Speaker 1>what my issue with all this is is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1227
00:54:52.930 --> 00:54:54.220
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you came to this,</v>

1228
00:54:54.780 --> 00:54:58.660
<v Speaker 1>this instant conclusion that I probably</v>
<v Speaker 1>would have reached as well about me</v>

1229
00:54:59.190 --> 00:55:00.370
<v Speaker 1>about certain subjects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1230
00:55:00.371 --> 00:55:02.740
<v Speaker 1>if he believes as he probably believes</v>
<v Speaker 1>that if he's discussed this,</v>

1231
00:55:02.890 --> 00:55:04.600
<v Speaker 1>then he believes that if he's discussed</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1232
00:55:04.720 --> 00:55:07.270
<v Speaker 1>then he believes that he's promoting</v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous pseudoscience,</v>

1233
00:55:07.570 --> 00:55:10.570
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I certainly have promoted a</v>

1234
00:55:10.571 --> 00:55:13.420
<v Speaker 1>nonsensical idea in that we never went</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the moon,</v>

1235
00:55:13.930 --> 00:55:17.050
<v Speaker 1>but it was based on a lot of really</v>
<v Speaker 1>fascinating,</v>

1236
00:55:17.051 --> 00:55:20.050
<v Speaker 1>weird pieces of evidence that are really</v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing.</v>

1237
00:55:20.051 --> 00:55:23.980
<v Speaker 1>Once you start going down that rabbit</v>
<v Speaker 1>hole and following them and watching</v>

1238
00:55:23.981 --> 00:55:27.970
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Neil Armstrong speech that he gives</v>

1239
00:55:27.971 --> 00:55:31.150
<v Speaker 1>the 25 year anniversary speech where he</v>
<v Speaker 1>talks about removing truths,</v>

1240
00:55:31.151 --> 00:55:36.070
<v Speaker 1>hidden layers and all this weird cryptic</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit that he did and then all the shit.</v>

1241
00:55:36.071 --> 00:55:39.400
<v Speaker 1>When you're looking at the videos of</v>
<v Speaker 1>them bouncing around where it looks like</v>

1242
00:55:39.401 --> 00:55:40.390
<v Speaker 1>they're on trampolines.</v>

1243
00:55:40.420 --> 00:55:43.750
<v Speaker 1>If you're inclined to be conspiratorial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all there for you.</v>

1244
00:55:43.930 --> 00:55:47.710
<v Speaker 1>The speech from President Clinton's book</v>
<v Speaker 1>where he talks about when he was working</v>

1245
00:55:47.711 --> 00:55:49.930
<v Speaker 1>with a carpenter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the first moon landings took place</v>

1246
00:55:49.931 --> 00:55:51.340
<v Speaker 1>in the carpenter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>told them that he didn't believe</v>

1247
00:55:51.341 --> 00:55:53.710
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those TV fellers said that they could</v>

1248
00:55:53.711 --> 00:55:55.450
<v Speaker 1>show they could fake anything and put it</v>
<v Speaker 1>on TV,</v>

1249
00:55:55.451 --> 00:55:56.950
<v Speaker 1>and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>back then I thought that guy was a</v>

1250
00:55:56.951 --> 00:55:59.710
<v Speaker 1>quack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but during all my years in the White</v>

1251
00:55:59.710 --> 00:56:01.240
<v Speaker 1>House,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started to think maybe he was just</v>

1252
00:56:01.241 --> 00:56:02.530
<v Speaker 1>ahead of his time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

1253
00:56:02.570 --> 00:56:04.390
<v Speaker 1>that's Bill Clinton in his book said</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1254
00:56:04.420 --> 00:56:07.600
<v Speaker 1>So if you conspiratorially minded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you start looking,</v>

1255
00:56:07.620 --> 00:56:08.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>confirmation bias.</v>

1256
00:56:08.771 --> 00:56:10.720
<v Speaker 1>You start looking for things to confirm</v>
<v Speaker 1>your idea.</v>

1257
00:56:10.721 --> 00:56:12.340
<v Speaker 1>Look at these intersecting shadows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1258
00:56:12.550 --> 00:56:13.400
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at this picture.</v>

1259
00:56:13.810 --> 00:56:15.370
<v Speaker 1>Pictures fake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if that picture is fake,</v>

1260
00:56:15.371 --> 00:56:16.204
<v Speaker 1>it still doesn't mean</v>

1261
00:56:16.220 --> 00:56:20.770
<v Speaker 4>go to the moon and consequently,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're inclined to think that nine</v>

1262
00:56:20.771 --> 00:56:23.590
<v Speaker 4>slash 11 was a government conspiracy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to be of the people who</v>

1263
00:56:23.591 --> 00:56:23.980
<v Speaker 4>spends the</v>

1264
00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:26.050
<v Speaker 2>most time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>quote unquote studying it,</v>

1265
00:56:26.080 --> 00:56:29.390
<v Speaker 2>which really makes means reading the</v>
<v Speaker 2>same stuff that confirms your belief on</v>

1266
00:56:29.750 --> 00:56:31.240
<v Speaker 2>the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most likely.</v>

1267
00:56:31.300 --> 00:56:35.050
<v Speaker 2>Or you could be someone who's absolutely</v>
<v Speaker 2>obsessed with proving that nine slash 11</v>

1268
00:56:35.051 --> 00:56:37.030
<v Speaker 2>was not an inside job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you could,</v>

1269
00:56:37.280 --> 00:56:42.100
<v Speaker 2>you can chase that down and look at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>conspiracy of confirmation bias that</v>

1270
00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:45.310
<v Speaker 2>resulted in all these crazy books and</v>
<v Speaker 2>documentaries and all these different</v>

1271
00:56:45.311 --> 00:56:47.920
<v Speaker 2>things where people came to these</v>
<v Speaker 2>erroneous conclusions.</v>

1272
00:56:47.950 --> 00:56:50.440
<v Speaker 2>Who spends the most time looking at</v>
<v Speaker 2>pictures of Ufo</v>

1273
00:56:52.210 --> 00:56:54.750
<v Speaker 2>pilots,</v>
<v Speaker 2>astronomers or asleep checks.</v>

1274
00:56:56.570 --> 00:56:58.250
<v Speaker 2>Get a couple more of these.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1275
00:56:58.420 --> 00:56:59.253
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1276
00:56:59.320 --> 00:57:04.320
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine it's people that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>obsessed and I would imagine that a lot</v>

1277
00:57:04.391 --> 00:57:07.660
<v Speaker 2>of those people were obsessed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are entertaining unhealthy ideas.</v>

1278
00:57:07.770 --> 00:57:09.550
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now that's what I said though,</v>

1279
00:57:09.551 --> 00:57:12.820
<v Speaker 2>a minute ago when we were talking about</v>
<v Speaker 2>architects and engineers on nine slash</v>

1280
00:57:12.821 --> 00:57:14.950
<v Speaker 2>11,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you kind of jumped on my logic,</v>

1281
00:57:14.980 --> 00:57:15.580
<v Speaker 2>but that's not the.</v>

1282
00:57:15.580 --> 00:57:17.380
<v Speaker 2>But that's different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about people that are</v>

1283
00:57:17.410 --> 00:57:19.570
<v Speaker 2>observing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not people who are trained in that</v>

1284
00:57:19.571 --> 00:57:21.850
<v Speaker 2>field.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you get 2000 plus 2000,</v>

1285
00:57:21.851 --> 00:57:23.620
<v Speaker 2>100 people that are trained in that</v>
<v Speaker 2>field.</v>

1286
00:57:24.040 --> 00:57:27.100
<v Speaker 2>Me personally as a non architect and</v>
<v Speaker 2>non-engineer,</v>

1287
00:57:27.310 --> 00:57:29.050
<v Speaker 2>I have to look at it a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 2>differently.</v>

1288
00:57:29.100 --> 00:57:31.270
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's nobody more trained in Ufo log</v>

1289
00:57:31.271 --> 00:57:32.300
<v Speaker 2>than you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Apologists.</v>

1290
00:57:32.330 --> 00:57:32.481
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1291
00:57:32.481 --> 00:57:32.740
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1292
00:57:32.740 --> 00:57:35.020
<v Speaker 2>Me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am the most trained in,</v>

1293
00:57:35.120 --> 00:57:36.940
<v Speaker 2>in euphology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't even know.</v>

1294
00:57:37.210 --> 00:57:39.100
<v Speaker 2>I'm the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you have any questions to use this</v>

1295
00:57:39.101 --> 00:57:41.440
<v Speaker 2>because I just got it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you need a go to guy?</v>

1296
00:57:42.240 --> 00:57:45.610
<v Speaker 2>I will give those guys ecstasy and</v>
<v Speaker 2>strippers and will,</v>

1297
00:57:45.670 --> 00:57:48.010
<v Speaker 2>will cure all this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Search in the skies.</v>

1298
00:57:48.880 --> 00:57:51.250
<v Speaker 2>Bunch of unfuckable white dudes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what we're dealing with,</v>

1299
00:57:51.260 --> 00:57:53.140
<v Speaker 2>Brian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the real issue.</v>

1300
00:57:53.380 --> 00:57:56.200
<v Speaker 2>But you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In some ways you're right in some ways</v>

1301
00:57:56.201 --> 00:57:59.950
<v Speaker 2>and we agree in some ways and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I absolutely agree with you that</v>

1302
00:57:59.951 --> 00:58:04.000
<v Speaker 2>I've been 100 percent irrational in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>past about certain things and also I get</v>

1303
00:58:04.001 --> 00:58:07.340
<v Speaker 2>caught up when I get into a discussion</v>
<v Speaker 2>with something about like,</v>

1304
00:58:07.420 --> 00:58:09.010
<v Speaker 2>like Phil plait with the Moon landings.</v>

1305
00:58:09.310 --> 00:58:12.280
<v Speaker 2>I'll get caught up in trying to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>correct or I'll get caught up,</v>

1306
00:58:12.281 --> 00:58:15.420
<v Speaker 2>caught up and trying to counter his</v>
<v Speaker 2>moves and treat it like it's a Jujitsu</v>

1307
00:58:15.430 --> 00:58:17.460
<v Speaker 2>match.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

1308
00:58:17.500 --> 00:58:20.080
<v Speaker 2>Why didn't you just make it a Jujitsu</v>
<v Speaker 2>match that weren't even in the room</v>

1309
00:58:20.081 --> 00:58:21.220
<v Speaker 2>together?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were in the room together.</v>

1310
00:58:21.221 --> 00:58:24.340
<v Speaker 2>It probably would've worked out better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was on the phone and I was on the</v>

1311
00:58:24.341 --> 00:58:26.110
<v Speaker 2>phone once.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was in studio once.</v>

1312
00:58:26.111 --> 00:58:27.820
<v Speaker 2>He was in studio once and we were on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>phone once.</v>

1313
00:58:27.850 --> 00:58:28.360
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1314
00:58:28.360 --> 00:58:30.670
<v Speaker 2>let me ask you this question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are we on time,</v>

1315
00:58:30.671 --> 00:58:31.501
<v Speaker 2>by the way?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea.</v>

1316
00:58:31.501 --> 00:58:33.360
<v Speaker 2>I know we can go as long as we wanted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1317
00:58:33.430 --> 00:58:34.510
<v Speaker 2>we don't have a boss.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of,</v>

1318
00:58:34.540 --> 00:58:35.770
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1319
00:58:35.920 --> 00:58:37.360
<v Speaker 2>that I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I put in my,</v>

1320
00:58:37.480 --> 00:58:39.960
<v Speaker 2>in my paragraph about you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I hope to,</v>

1321
00:58:40.330 --> 00:58:45.220
<v Speaker 2>would love to completely redirect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was a criticism of what you say so</v>

1322
00:58:45.221 --> 00:58:45.550
<v Speaker 2>often.</v>

1323
00:58:45.550 --> 00:58:47.410
<v Speaker 2>It's just that I'm just the guy asking</v>
<v Speaker 2>him questions.</v>

1324
00:58:47.770 --> 00:58:49.930
<v Speaker 2>Shouldn't we be looking at this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shouldn't we be asking these questions?</v>

1325
00:58:49.950 --> 00:58:52.720
<v Speaker 2>Am I saying that you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Am I saying that right now?</v>

1326
00:58:52.860 --> 00:58:56.770
<v Speaker 2>I have said that asking questions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe Rogan questions everything.</v>

1327
00:58:56.800 --> 00:58:58.090
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1328
00:58:58.230 --> 00:58:59.350
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when I'm.</v>

1329
00:58:59.410 --> 00:59:00.280
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you go,</v>

1330
00:59:00.490 --> 00:59:03.310
<v Speaker 2>that's not a good example because if you</v>
<v Speaker 2>go over that,</v>

1331
00:59:03.311 --> 00:59:06.160
<v Speaker 2>it's me destroying pseudoscience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you go over that show,</v>

1332
00:59:06.161 --> 00:59:08.740
<v Speaker 2>it's like I got attacked by more people</v>
<v Speaker 2>that fucking believe in chem trails</v>

1333
00:59:08.741 --> 00:59:11.650
<v Speaker 2>because of that show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>explaining the actual science behind</v>

1334
00:59:11.980 --> 00:59:13.590
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thing that I sent you with Rosanne</v>

1335
00:59:13.950 --> 00:59:16.250
<v Speaker 2>where I explained the science behind jet</v>
<v Speaker 2>engines.</v>

1336
00:59:16.290 --> 00:59:19.480
<v Speaker 2>Great job by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought you did a wonderful job going</v>

1337
00:59:19.490 --> 00:59:21.570
<v Speaker 2>and talking to Roseanne.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The chemistry.</v>

1338
00:59:21.580 --> 00:59:24.380
<v Speaker 2>Well that's all credit to request from a</v>
<v Speaker 2>metal bunk.</v>

1339
00:59:24.620 --> 00:59:27.920
<v Speaker 2>He was a software engineer and a</v>
<v Speaker 2>brilliant guy.</v>

1340
00:59:27.980 --> 00:59:31.520
<v Speaker 2>Software engineering or business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was the Tony Hawk did?</v>

1341
00:59:31.521 --> 00:59:35.990
<v Speaker 2>Tony Hawk</v>
<v Speaker 2>epic games and you know,</v>

1342
00:59:35.991 --> 00:59:40.910
<v Speaker 2>he sold his share in that and just</v>
<v Speaker 2>decided to debunk conspiracies and he's</v>

1343
00:59:40.911 --> 00:59:45.740
<v Speaker 2>brilliant at you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he breaks it down so eloquently on</v>

1344
00:59:45.741 --> 00:59:47.870
<v Speaker 2>the show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We brought them on the show to sort of</v>

1345
00:59:48.500 --> 00:59:51.500
<v Speaker 2>establish the science behind contracts</v>
<v Speaker 2>and chem trails.</v>

1346
00:59:52.010 --> 00:59:52.710
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so my,</v>

1347
00:59:52.710 --> 00:59:54.840
<v Speaker 4>my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my point with the whole asking</v>

1348
00:59:54.841 --> 00:59:55.790
<v Speaker 4>questions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>things and,</v>

1349
00:59:55.791 --> 00:59:58.440
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the validity of saying that it goes</v>

1350
00:59:58.441 --> 01:00:01.560
<v Speaker 4>a lot toward the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the idea of visit.</v>

1351
01:00:01.590 --> 01:00:05.680
<v Speaker 4>Is it smart to debate questions of</v>
<v Speaker 4>pseudoscience?</v>

1352
01:00:05.720 --> 01:00:08.830
<v Speaker 4>I guess right now what's happening is</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bill Nye is A.</v>

1353
01:00:09.010 --> 01:00:11.850
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sure if it happened yet already,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but bill Nye is going to the creation</v>

1354
01:00:11.851 --> 01:00:14.370
<v Speaker 4>museum to debate creationists.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>

1355
01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:15.180
<v Speaker 4>I heard about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1356
01:00:15.180 --> 01:00:19.080
<v Speaker 4>Now there's that that triggers a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 4>pro and con thought in the,</v>

1357
01:00:19.140 --> 01:00:22.710
<v Speaker 4>in the science communication business</v>
<v Speaker 4>because many of us,</v>

1358
01:00:22.711 --> 01:00:25.470
<v Speaker 4>myself included,</v>
<v Speaker 4>think that it does more harm than good</v>

1359
01:00:25.950 --> 01:00:29.070
<v Speaker 4>because you're suggesting to anyone who</v>
<v Speaker 4>might be on the fence,</v>

1360
01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:32.940
<v Speaker 4>you're suggesting to them that there is</v>
<v Speaker 4>a debatable question here.</v>

1361
01:00:33.870 --> 01:00:38.870
<v Speaker 4>When you have something that is clearly</v>
<v Speaker 4>an established fact backed up by all</v>

1362
01:00:39.511 --> 01:00:43.920
<v Speaker 4>available evidence and something that's</v>
<v Speaker 4>crazy and has no possible evidence for</v>

1363
01:00:43.921 --> 01:00:44.754
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

1364
01:00:45.060 --> 01:00:47.400
<v Speaker 4>We don't hold scientific debates about</v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

1365
01:00:47.950 --> 01:00:50.520
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we move forward with our lives and when</v>

1366
01:00:50.521 --> 01:00:53.790
<v Speaker 4>you go out and you hold a debate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you agree to have a debate,</v>

1367
01:00:54.090 --> 01:00:55.950
<v Speaker 4>you're going to convince anyone who's on</v>
<v Speaker 4>the fence.</v>

1368
01:00:55.980 --> 01:00:57.270
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe there is a question here that</v>

1369
01:00:57.271 --> 01:00:59.970
<v Speaker 4>needs to be looked at.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And in fact,</v>

1370
01:01:00.030 --> 01:01:00.863
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1371
01:01:01.090 --> 01:01:03.270
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's arguable that you do more</v>

1372
01:01:03.271 --> 01:01:05.820
<v Speaker 4>harm than good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so by the same token,</v>

1373
01:01:06.750 --> 01:01:08.850
<v Speaker 4>I say that it's really possible when you</v>
<v Speaker 4>say,</v>

1374
01:01:08.851 --> 01:01:10.830
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just the guy asking questions about</v>

1375
01:01:10.831 --> 01:01:12.630
<v Speaker 4>building seven or whatever the subject</v>
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>

1376
01:01:13.020 --> 01:01:17.400
<v Speaker 4>that you're potentially doing more harm</v>
<v Speaker 4>than good by suggesting that there is a</v>

1377
01:01:17.401 --> 01:01:19.710
<v Speaker 4>questionable subject here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Roswell,</v>

1378
01:01:19.740 --> 01:01:20.760
<v Speaker 4>let's take for example.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

1379
01:01:20.761 --> 01:01:22.170
<v Speaker 4>I'm just thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I asked him questions.</v>

1380
01:01:22.171 --> 01:01:24.930
<v Speaker 4>Isn't it strange that there were three</v>
<v Speaker 4>small bodies that needed coffins?</v>

1381
01:01:25.950 --> 01:01:27.720
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's start with the,</v>

1382
01:01:27.730 --> 01:01:29.010
<v Speaker 4>the one one example.</v>

1383
01:01:29.350 --> 01:01:33.630
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you think that potentially addressing a</v>

1384
01:01:33.631 --> 01:01:36.570
<v Speaker 4>reality,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a reality in the way something looks,</v>

1385
01:01:37.110 --> 01:01:40.410
<v Speaker 4>that that could be dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that in somehow people could miss</v>

1386
01:01:40.411 --> 01:01:43.080
<v Speaker 4>through that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>misconstrue that for being support for a</v>

1387
01:01:43.081 --> 01:01:45.690
<v Speaker 4>conspiracy theory.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that when you take,</v>

1388
01:01:45.750 --> 01:01:50.430
<v Speaker 4>when you ask questions and you make an</v>
<v Speaker 4>argument that says,</v>

1389
01:01:50.431 --> 01:01:52.350
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>shouldn't we ask questions about this?</v>

1390
01:01:52.351 --> 01:01:56.790
<v Speaker 4>Which is the answer is usually yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But when it's on a matter of basically</v>

1391
01:01:56.791 --> 01:01:59.700
<v Speaker 4>settled science,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you're doing more harm than good</v>

1392
01:01:59.701 --> 01:02:00.990
<v Speaker 4>by suggesting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

1393
01:02:00.991 --> 01:02:03.900
<v Speaker 4>shouldn't we question whether two plus</v>
<v Speaker 4>two equals four?</v>

1394
01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:06.990
<v Speaker 4>Isn't it okay to ask,</v>
<v Speaker 4>does two plus two equals five?</v>

1395
01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:08.520
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know that there's massive</v>

1396
01:02:08.521 --> 01:02:12.480
<v Speaker 4>inconsistencies in the studies that were</v>
<v Speaker 4>done about nine slash 11 that a disputed</v>

1397
01:02:12.481 --> 01:02:16.050
<v Speaker 4>about like the free fall speed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know there's a lot of anomalies that</v>

1398
01:02:16.051 --> 01:02:17.970
<v Speaker 4>people will picked out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I wouldn't say that there's any</v>

1399
01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:20.250
<v Speaker 4>inconsistencies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The evidence</v>

1400
01:02:20.490 --> 01:02:23.970
<v Speaker 2>when we talking about technic testable</v>
<v Speaker 2>evidence that you can hold in your hand.</v>

1401
01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.070
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I would mean by inconsistencies is</v>

1402
01:02:26.071 --> 01:02:30.290
<v Speaker 2>things that anomalies is a better word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Things that you don't usually find like</v>

1403
01:02:30.300 --> 01:02:33.000
<v Speaker 2>buildings falling at free,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fall speed and then saying that is one</v>

1404
01:02:33.001 --> 01:02:36.220
<v Speaker 2>second less than free fall speed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All these things fuel the,</v>

1405
01:02:36.221 --> 01:02:37.320
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the debate,</v>

1406
01:02:37.530 --> 01:02:39.270
<v Speaker 2>all these things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get people excited about it,</v>

1407
01:02:39.271 --> 01:02:44.010
<v Speaker 2>but to deny that these things exist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think is silly because then you fueled</v>

1408
01:02:44.011 --> 01:02:46.950
<v Speaker 2>the conspiracy theories even more</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you're denying something that</v>

1409
01:02:46.951 --> 01:02:48.800
<v Speaker 2>seems obvious to the eye.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The eye,</v>

1410
01:02:48.840 --> 01:02:50.700
<v Speaker 2>the average person that looks at that</v>
<v Speaker 2>building says yes,</v>

1411
01:02:50.701 --> 01:02:52.350
<v Speaker 2>that does look like a controlled</v>
<v Speaker 2>demolition.</v>

1412
01:02:52.650 --> 01:02:53.970
<v Speaker 2>Does that mean it is?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1413
01:02:53.971 --> 01:02:56.100
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to pretend that it doesn't look like</v>

1414
01:02:56.101 --> 01:02:59.670
<v Speaker 2>that is ridiculous to about 10,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is not odd that it falls at free.</v>

1415
01:02:59.670 --> 01:03:02.640
<v Speaker 2>Fall speed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure anyone is denying that.</v>

1416
01:03:02.641 --> 01:03:06.180
<v Speaker 2>It looks like a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The part of it you can see in the video,</v>

1417
01:03:06.300 --> 01:03:08.530
<v Speaker 2>it does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks exactly like a control.</v>

1418
01:03:08.570 --> 01:03:11.760
<v Speaker 2>You criticized me for what you agree</v>
<v Speaker 2>with that it looks like a controlled</v>

1419
01:03:11.761 --> 01:03:13.830
<v Speaker 2>demolition discussing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1420
01:03:13.831 --> 01:03:16.110
<v Speaker 2>that's not what.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not what I'm criticizing you for.</v>

1421
01:03:16.111 --> 01:03:17.760
<v Speaker 2>I agree that it looks like a controlled</v>
<v Speaker 2>demolition.</v>

1422
01:03:17.761 --> 01:03:20.460
<v Speaker 2>That's not the question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The question is whether it should be</v>

1423
01:03:20.461 --> 01:03:21.780
<v Speaker 2>brought up now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1424
01:03:22.020 --> 01:03:22.780
<v Speaker 2>I mean you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

1425
01:03:22.780 --> 01:03:24.730
<v Speaker 2>we're sticking on this one example of</v>
<v Speaker 2>building seven.</v>

1426
01:03:25.410 --> 01:03:27.930
<v Speaker 2>We haven't resolved it yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a good example because it's an</v>

1427
01:03:27.931 --> 01:03:31.770
<v Speaker 2>example that you use as an example of</v>
<v Speaker 2>you thinking that if you listen to me</v>

1428
01:03:31.771 --> 01:03:35.910
<v Speaker 2>just describe what I see with my eyes</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it sounds to me like I'm supporting</v>

1429
01:03:35.911 --> 01:03:39.120
<v Speaker 2>some sort of a conspiracy theory when</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm 100 percent not.</v>

1430
01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:42.890
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would you.</v>

1431
01:03:44.860 --> 01:03:48.610
<v Speaker 2>It seems like you have topics that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>off limits and that like this discuss</v>

1432
01:03:48.611 --> 01:03:51.580
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even did it to look at the reality of</v>

1433
01:03:51.581 --> 01:03:55.210
<v Speaker 2>the speed that it fell to Steven.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bring it up is off limits.</v>

1434
01:03:55.750 --> 01:03:58.810
<v Speaker 2>Even if you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe in the conspiracy,</v>

1435
01:03:58.811 --> 01:04:02.060
<v Speaker 2>but isn't it crazy that building looks</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a controlled.</v>

1436
01:04:02.070 --> 01:04:05.260
<v Speaker 2>The only reason that this is a difficult</v>
<v Speaker 2>example to talk about is because it's</v>

1437
01:04:05.261 --> 01:04:10.261
<v Speaker 2>one that so ideologically charged,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right as his bill Nye talking about</v>

1438
01:04:11.621 --> 01:04:12.920
<v Speaker 2>creationism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

1439
01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:16.060
<v Speaker 2>there's really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's really nobody who's on the fence</v>

1440
01:04:16.061 --> 01:04:19.180
<v Speaker 2>about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're either a creation story or not.</v>

1441
01:04:19.181 --> 01:04:20.920
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there might be some people who are on</v>

1442
01:04:20.921 --> 01:04:22.540
<v Speaker 2>the fence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's a lot on me.</v>

1443
01:04:22.541 --> 01:04:23.710
<v Speaker 2>I don't quite buy it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1444
01:04:23.711 --> 01:04:25.540
<v Speaker 2>let's look at the numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Gallup poll,</v>

1445
01:04:25.541 --> 01:04:30.160
<v Speaker 2>the most recent Gallup poll on the age</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the earth was more than 46 percent.</v>

1446
01:04:30.160 --> 01:04:33.100
<v Speaker 2>Tell me more than 46 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Think the earth is less than 10,000</v>

1447
01:04:33.101 --> 01:04:33.934
<v Speaker 2>years old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to know.</v>

1448
01:04:34.150 --> 01:04:35.430
<v Speaker 2>It's shocking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1449
01:04:35.450 --> 01:04:37.240
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know exactly where it comes from.</v>

1450
01:04:37.270 --> 01:04:39.220
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many of those people have been</v>

1451
01:04:39.221 --> 01:04:41.860
<v Speaker 2>exposed to actual science,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actual research,</v>

1452
01:04:41.861 --> 01:04:44.140
<v Speaker 2>actual data?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone who's really cosmetic,</v>

1453
01:04:44.141 --> 01:04:47.740
<v Speaker 2>like a neil degrasse Tyson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who could break down the what we know</v>

1454
01:04:47.741 --> 01:04:49.120
<v Speaker 2>about science,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we've done,</v>

1455
01:04:49.121 --> 01:04:54.121
<v Speaker 2>what great work has been shown that we</v>
<v Speaker 2>can carbon date things we know about the</v>

1456
01:04:55.061 --> 01:04:59.100
<v Speaker 2>date of stars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can follow the radio waves in this,</v>

1457
01:04:59.180 --> 01:05:03.190
<v Speaker 2>in that we can measure in space and</v>
<v Speaker 2>prove that there was a big bang 14</v>

1458
01:05:03.190 --> 01:05:06.090
<v Speaker 2>billion years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All that stuff is so exciting that if</v>

1459
01:05:06.100 --> 01:05:08.200
<v Speaker 2>it's done correctly by a guy like Neil</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tyson,</v>

1460
01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:11.350
<v Speaker 2>it can be unbelievably culturally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>culturally valuable,</v>

1461
01:05:11.470 --> 01:05:15.160
<v Speaker 2>but those 46 percent of the people that</v>
<v Speaker 2>believed that the earth is 10,000 years</v>

1462
01:05:15.161 --> 01:05:18.010
<v Speaker 2>old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can almost guarantee that they</v>

1463
01:05:18.010 --> 01:05:21.340
<v Speaker 1>haven't had that in their life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just haven't been exposed to a</v>

1464
01:05:21.341 --> 01:05:25.570
<v Speaker 1>charismatic scientist or a documentary</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was unbelievably compelling.</v>

1465
01:05:25.571 --> 01:05:29.050
<v Speaker 1>That jived with their Christian ideology</v>
<v Speaker 1>so much they could absorb it.</v>

1466
01:05:29.380 --> 01:05:30.760
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there had been brainwashed.</v>

1467
01:05:30.761 --> 01:05:32.740
<v Speaker 1>They've been fucked over by their own</v>
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>

1468
01:05:32.741 --> 01:05:34.360
<v Speaker 1>They've been fucked over by their</v>
<v Speaker 1>community.</v>

1469
01:05:34.540 --> 01:05:37.690
<v Speaker 1>They've been fucked over by these</v>
<v Speaker 1>dummies that raised them and taught them</v>

1470
01:05:37.691 --> 01:05:42.691
<v Speaker 1>this silly idea that so easily disproven</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it makes them a joke to anybody.</v>

1471
01:05:43.211 --> 01:05:45.430
<v Speaker 1>That's had any sort of formal education</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever,</v>

1472
01:05:45.431 --> 01:05:48.040
<v Speaker 1>and it's almost half the population.</v>

1473
01:05:48.340 --> 01:05:52.880
<v Speaker 4>Let let me point out something that it</v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of a surprising similarity between</v>

1474
01:05:53.480 --> 01:05:57.920
<v Speaker 4>belief in creation as an belief in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>Kennedy,</v>

1475
01:05:58.230 --> 01:06:00.500
<v Speaker 4>the Kennedy assassination,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there are,</v>

1476
01:06:00.501 --> 01:06:03.800
<v Speaker 4>like we talked about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there are a dozen law.</v>

1477
01:06:03.840 --> 01:06:04.760
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's hundreds,</v>

1478
01:06:04.790 --> 01:06:08.750
<v Speaker 4>but let's say that there's a dozen</v>
<v Speaker 4>different kennedy conspiracies that are</v>

1479
01:06:08.751 --> 01:06:10.730
<v Speaker 4>mutually exclusive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just for sake of argument,</v>

1480
01:06:10.731 --> 01:06:12.120
<v Speaker 4>let's pretend it's a dozen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1481
01:06:12.230 --> 01:06:15.950
<v Speaker 4>You've got about just as many theories</v>
<v Speaker 4>of creation.</v>

1482
01:06:16.010 --> 01:06:18.860
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That are completely incompatible,</v>

1483
01:06:18.890 --> 01:06:21.920
<v Speaker 4>which is nothing existed until 6,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>years ago.</v>

1484
01:06:21.921 --> 01:06:26.210
<v Speaker 4>Everything poof appeared with exactly</v>
<v Speaker 4>the appearance of age you've got.</v>

1485
01:06:26.270 --> 01:06:30.830
<v Speaker 4>The earth is actually old,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but life is is a recent creation.</v>

1486
01:06:31.010 --> 01:06:34.760
<v Speaker 4>You've got all the other animals are old</v>
<v Speaker 4>and evolution happened in everything</v>

1487
01:06:34.761 --> 01:06:37.280
<v Speaker 4>except humans,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which were a special creation event.</v>

1488
01:06:37.850 --> 01:06:41.930
<v Speaker 4>You've got humans didn't evolve the way</v>
<v Speaker 4>science tells us,</v>

1489
01:06:42.080 --> 01:06:47.080
<v Speaker 4>but then suddenly we were given souls on</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Adam and eve day or you've got all</v>

1490
01:06:49.131 --> 01:06:51.860
<v Speaker 4>of these holidays now that we found a</v>
<v Speaker 4>columbus is an asshole.</v>

1491
01:06:52.460 --> 01:06:55.130
<v Speaker 4>Now you can eat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can come up with science and and lot</v>

1492
01:06:55.131 --> 01:06:57.200
<v Speaker 4>of people have they've.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They've come up with quote unquote</v>

1493
01:06:57.201 --> 01:06:59.660
<v Speaker 4>science to support each one of these</v>
<v Speaker 4>different theories.</v>

1494
01:06:59.750 --> 01:07:01.100
<v Speaker 4>Not really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1495
01:07:01.110 --> 01:07:01.840
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

1496
01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:04.130
<v Speaker 4>What is in there?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What qualifies in their mind as</v>

1497
01:07:04.190 --> 01:07:05.370
<v Speaker 4>scientific support for.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

1498
01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:10.720
<v Speaker 4>so exactly like the people who support</v>
<v Speaker 4>all these different versions of the</v>

1499
01:07:11.811 --> 01:07:14.990
<v Speaker 4>Kennedy conspiracy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even though all of their theories are</v>

1500
01:07:14.991 --> 01:07:19.880
<v Speaker 4>mutually in mutually exclusive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>completely incompatible.</v>

1501
01:07:20.120 --> 01:07:23.120
<v Speaker 4>They all agree with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They all consider themselves to be on</v>

1502
01:07:23.121 --> 01:07:27.190
<v Speaker 4>the same page in that they reject the</v>
<v Speaker 4>quote unquote official.</v>

1503
01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:31.040
<v Speaker 1>I find that to be a disingenuous</v>
<v Speaker 1>argument because the argument for the</v>

1504
01:07:31.041 --> 01:07:34.340
<v Speaker 1>earth being billions of years old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the universe being billions of years old</v>

1505
01:07:34.341 --> 01:07:39.341
<v Speaker 1>is unbelievably unfathomably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>An overwhelming genius after genius has</v>

1506
01:07:41.121 --> 01:07:46.121
<v Speaker 1>broken down all the various particles of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fucking universe and the dark matter</v>

1507
01:07:46.221 --> 01:07:51.020
<v Speaker 1>in the skies and the fact that inside</v>
<v Speaker 1>every black hole may ultimately be</v>

1508
01:07:51.021 --> 01:07:54.020
<v Speaker 1>another universe with hundreds of</v>
<v Speaker 1>billions of galaxies inside of it,</v>

1509
01:07:54.021 --> 01:07:58.220
<v Speaker 1>with black holes in each one of them</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the number of people that have</v>

1510
01:07:58.221 --> 01:08:03.221
<v Speaker 1>worked on provable conclusions about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>age of things using carbon dating or</v>

1511
01:08:04.470 --> 01:08:06.860
<v Speaker 1>what does the other way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>radiocarbon dating and what's the new</v>

1512
01:08:06.861 --> 01:08:07.540
<v Speaker 1>one that they're doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1513
01:08:07.540 --> 01:08:11.150
<v Speaker 1>there's all sorts of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the sheer overwhelming numbers to</v>

1514
01:08:11.151 --> 01:08:16.151
<v Speaker 1>ignore that because you read some stupid</v>
<v Speaker 1>old book I think is way ridiculous than</v>

1515
01:08:16.220 --> 01:08:21.220
<v Speaker 1>to look at a guy who was murdered and</v>
<v Speaker 1>know that someone shot him and that it</v>

1516
01:08:21.351 --> 01:08:24.590
<v Speaker 1>might've been this guy that this other</v>
<v Speaker 1>gangster came and shot and killed,</v>

1517
01:08:24.591 --> 01:08:28.190
<v Speaker 1>but we'll never know because he's dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But so many other pieces.</v>

1518
01:08:28.191 --> 01:08:31.850
<v Speaker 1>Vince Bugliosi could sit here and make</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly the same argument in reverse,</v>

1519
01:08:31.910 --> 01:08:34.010
<v Speaker 1>but he's chasing ghosts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're chasing ghosts.</v>

1520
01:08:34.011 --> 01:08:37.910
<v Speaker 1>You can't go back to 1963.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know how you gonna prove what</v>

1521
01:08:37.940 --> 01:08:38.773
<v Speaker 1>happened</v>

1522
01:08:39.530 --> 01:08:42.660
<v Speaker 4>back to 6,000 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so you were were you there and you</v>

1523
01:08:42.690 --> 01:08:44.720
<v Speaker 4>see dinosaurs running around a billion</v>
<v Speaker 4>years ago.</v>

1524
01:08:44.800 --> 01:08:46.700
<v Speaker 1>That's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not compatible because you could</v>

1525
01:08:46.701 --> 01:08:48.680
<v Speaker 1>take,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could take a piece of wood and you</v>

1526
01:08:48.681 --> 01:08:50.990
<v Speaker 1>can carbon date that piece of wood and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you find out what this word is,</v>

1527
01:08:50.991 --> 01:08:52.910
<v Speaker 1>5,000 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can do that.</v>

1528
01:08:52.970 --> 01:08:55.340
<v Speaker 1>That's done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a real thing when you're dealing</v>

1529
01:08:55.341 --> 01:08:57.080
<v Speaker 1>with the Kennedy assassination is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1530
01:08:57.081 --> 01:09:00.170
<v Speaker 1>you've got some stories and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got some facts and yeah,</v>

1531
01:09:00.171 --> 01:09:04.730
<v Speaker 1>you've got some circumstances,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but putting it all together is a very</v>

1532
01:09:04.731 --> 01:09:08.240
<v Speaker 1>complicated series of events that took</v>
<v Speaker 1>place in order to kill that guy and take</v>

1533
01:09:08.241 --> 01:09:12.320
<v Speaker 1>his body and fly it to Bethesda,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maryland and who gotten how to Jack</v>

1534
01:09:12.320 --> 01:09:14.210
<v Speaker 1>Ruby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get in there and who benefited from all</v>

1535
01:09:14.211 --> 01:09:16.620
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of variables and you are</v>

1536
01:09:16.730 --> 01:09:18.770
<v Speaker 1>also exist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but hold on,</v>

1537
01:09:18.771 --> 01:09:20.750
<v Speaker 1>but variables that don't exist when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're examining,</v>

1538
01:09:21.020 --> 01:09:24.320
<v Speaker 1>say like the core of the earth when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're examining the birth and death of</v>

1539
01:09:24.321 --> 01:09:25.310
<v Speaker 1>stars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hyper,</v>

1540
01:09:25.311 --> 01:09:27.260
<v Speaker 1>Novas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these things that we can absolutely</v>

1541
01:09:27.261 --> 01:09:29.810
<v Speaker 1>prove are a part of our natural world</v>

1542
01:09:29.900 --> 01:09:30.621
<v Speaker 4>we live in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

1543
01:09:30.621 --> 01:09:32.700
<v Speaker 4>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're talking down to you're,</v>

1544
01:09:32.730 --> 01:09:33.563
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

1545
01:09:33.630 --> 01:09:37.400
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're ignoring the question of what</v>

1546
01:09:37.430 --> 01:09:41.750
<v Speaker 4>constitutes evidence because there are</v>
<v Speaker 4>people who will make a compelling speech</v>

1547
01:09:41.780 --> 01:09:44.780
<v Speaker 4>about why carbon dating is invalid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

1548
01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:47.790
<v Speaker 4>Maybe the Lord has changed the route,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1549
01:09:47.840 --> 01:09:48.350
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1550
01:09:48.350 --> 01:09:48.790
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1551
01:09:48.790 --> 01:09:51.950
<v Speaker 4>the speed at which a elements decay over</v>
<v Speaker 4>over the,</v>

1552
01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:54.620
<v Speaker 4>over the centuries.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now that's something you can't argue</v>

1553
01:09:54.621 --> 01:09:57.020
<v Speaker 4>with because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's what we call a special pleading.</v>

1554
01:09:57.021 --> 01:09:58.010
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's this,</v>

1555
01:09:58.011 --> 01:10:00.320
<v Speaker 4>as in humans,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we small humans are not able to</v>

1556
01:10:00.321 --> 01:10:03.830
<v Speaker 4>understand this and that's an argument</v>
<v Speaker 4>that can be used to defend just about</v>

1557
01:10:03.860 --> 01:10:06.590
<v Speaker 4>any pseudoscience or just about any</v>
<v Speaker 4>pseudo history.</v>

1558
01:10:06.950 --> 01:10:11.060
<v Speaker 4>So I mean you can apply exactly the same</v>
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>

1559
01:10:12.770 --> 01:10:16.610
<v Speaker 4>Alternate versions of the Kennedy</v>
<v Speaker 4>history are always going to be just as</v>

1560
01:10:16.611 --> 01:10:21.440
<v Speaker 4>valid as alternate versions of the age</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the earth and devolution and it's,</v>

1561
01:10:21.470 --> 01:10:23.860
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're made invalid in there.</v>

1562
01:10:24.020 --> 01:10:28.370
<v Speaker 4>They are presented as being valid using</v>
<v Speaker 4>evidence that cannot be argued against</v>

1563
01:10:28.371 --> 01:10:33.371
<v Speaker 4>because it's theoretical sort of here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here's the problem with the government.</v>

1564
01:10:33.650 --> 01:10:37.040
<v Speaker 4>The government has been proven time and</v>
<v Speaker 4>time again to be full of shit.</v>

1565
01:10:37.370 --> 01:10:40.820
<v Speaker 4>So when you look at official government</v>
<v Speaker 4>stories and you say,</v>

1566
01:10:40.821 --> 01:10:45.080
<v Speaker 4>well let's take this as our conclusion</v>
<v Speaker 4>and now let's work backward from here</v>

1567
01:10:45.290 --> 01:10:47.060
<v Speaker 4>and find out what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what took place.</v>

1568
01:10:47.090 --> 01:10:49.280
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we know that Lee Harvey Oswald acted</v>

1569
01:10:49.281 --> 01:10:52.040
<v Speaker 4>alone because the government says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we know that Jack Ruby was a bad guy and</v>

1570
01:10:52.041 --> 01:10:55.130
<v Speaker 4>he was very patriotic and he was really</v>
<v Speaker 4>sad and so that's why he did what he did</v>

1571
01:10:55.131 --> 01:10:56.660
<v Speaker 4>and case closed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wrap it up,</v>

1572
01:10:56.661 --> 01:10:58.880
<v Speaker 4>tie boom.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you</v>

1573
01:10:59.140 --> 01:11:01.540
<v Speaker 1>and you look at all that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't stand up to scrutiny.</v>

1574
01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:02.650
<v Speaker 1>It does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't.</v>

1575
01:11:02.650 --> 01:11:04.030
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're dealing with a liar,</v>

1576
01:11:04.190 --> 01:11:06.400
<v Speaker 1>a liar told you this crazy story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Damn man.</v>

1577
01:11:06.401 --> 01:11:07.840
<v Speaker 1>I was on your way over to your house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1578
01:11:07.841 --> 01:11:10.570
<v Speaker 1>But a fucking asteroid came down and</v>
<v Speaker 1>knocked my tire off and I need another</v>

1579
01:11:10.571 --> 01:11:12.940
<v Speaker 1>tire side to wait in line and do what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so sorry I'm late.</v>

1580
01:11:13.180 --> 01:11:14.160
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy's a liar.</v>

1581
01:11:14.161 --> 01:11:16.140
<v Speaker 1>He lies all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He probably lied about this too.</v>

1582
01:11:16.350 --> 01:11:18.240
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're dealing with something like</v>

1583
01:11:18.300 --> 01:11:21.360
<v Speaker 1>the United States government that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>shown itself over and over and over</v>

1584
01:11:21.361 --> 01:11:23.490
<v Speaker 1>again to be full of shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'd be very convenient to tell the</v>

1585
01:11:23.491 --> 01:11:26.550
<v Speaker 1>people what they want the people to</v>
<v Speaker 1>think rather than what is actually the</v>

1586
01:11:26.551 --> 01:11:29.520
<v Speaker 1>truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then he start citing instance after</v>

1587
01:11:29.521 --> 01:11:32.040
<v Speaker 1>instance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not just a blind accusations,</v>

1588
01:11:32.041 --> 01:11:35.940
<v Speaker 1>but instance after instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no longer do I think that it is not</v>

1589
01:11:35.941 --> 01:11:38.730
<v Speaker 1>likely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nor is it logical to assume that the,</v>

1590
01:11:39.030 --> 01:11:41.250
<v Speaker 1>let's go official store,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a douchey term.</v>

1591
01:11:41.280 --> 01:11:44.130
<v Speaker 1>It's a very loaded term.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The official story makes it question,</v>

1592
01:11:44.520 --> 01:11:49.170
<v Speaker 1>but you to assume that the story that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>had been told in the mainstream media</v>

1593
01:11:49.171 --> 01:11:51.180
<v Speaker 1>and the news is correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make sense.</v>

1594
01:11:51.181 --> 01:11:53.760
<v Speaker 1>Why would you assume it was correct,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're talking to a liar.</v>

1595
01:11:54.060 --> 01:11:57.840
<v Speaker 4>But scientists have told us that carbon,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that carbon dating works,</v>

1596
01:11:57.870 --> 01:11:58.550
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1597
01:11:58.550 --> 01:12:01.270
<v Speaker 4>but we're talking about it's a matter of</v>
<v Speaker 4>faith in it.</v>

1598
01:12:01.450 --> 01:12:04.180
<v Speaker 4>We have to have faith in the scientists</v>
<v Speaker 4>to accept carbon.</v>

1599
01:12:04.540 --> 01:12:05.351
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly not.</v>

1600
01:12:05.351 --> 01:12:07.510
<v Speaker 1>You read the science on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You read how they come up with the</v>

1601
01:12:07.511 --> 01:12:08.680
<v Speaker 1>conclusions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm an idiot,</v>

1602
01:12:08.681 --> 01:12:11.830
<v Speaker 1>but I read about carbon dating when I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was trying to figure out why they could</v>

1603
01:12:11.831 --> 01:12:14.320
<v Speaker 1>figure out that dinosaurs existed 65</v>
<v Speaker 1>million years ago.</v>

1604
01:12:14.920 --> 01:12:18.610
<v Speaker 1>I'm unbelievably terrified and</v>
<v Speaker 1>fascinated by asteroidal impacts and</v>

1605
01:12:18.611 --> 01:12:22.710
<v Speaker 1>it's one of my main obsessions when it</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes to like late night freakouts</v>

1606
01:12:22.780 --> 01:12:24.870
<v Speaker 1>watching the discovery channel and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1607
01:12:24.910 --> 01:12:26.860
<v Speaker 1>watching,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1608
01:12:26.880 --> 01:12:27.400
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1609
01:12:27.400 --> 01:12:32.290
<v Speaker 1>just the idea that one day we could get</v>
<v Speaker 1>hit by one of these 800 plus thousand</v>

1610
01:12:32.291 --> 01:12:36.310
<v Speaker 1>near Earth objects that are fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>gigantic stones flying through the</v>

1611
01:12:36.311 --> 01:12:37.690
<v Speaker 1>earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm fascinated by that shit.</v>

1612
01:12:37.810 --> 01:12:42.280
<v Speaker 1>So I got pretty deep into the whole idea</v>
<v Speaker 1>of carbon dating and the whole idea,</v>

1613
01:12:42.281 --> 01:12:44.710
<v Speaker 1>like how they figured it out and I've</v>
<v Speaker 1>read a bunch of articles on it and I</v>

1614
01:12:44.711 --> 01:12:48.010
<v Speaker 1>watched documentaries on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty easy to figure out from an</v>

1615
01:12:48.011 --> 01:12:49.960
<v Speaker 1>idiot's point of view,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like how they're doing it.</v>

1616
01:12:50.080 --> 01:12:51.580
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't understand the science</v>
<v Speaker 1>behind it.</v>

1617
01:12:51.581 --> 01:12:54.850
<v Speaker 1>I can't really replicate it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I listened to them describe it and</v>

1618
01:12:54.851 --> 01:12:56.230
<v Speaker 1>it clicks with me and it makes sense.</v>

1619
01:12:56.410 --> 01:12:57.760
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I mean,</v>

1620
01:12:58.330 --> 01:13:00.880
<v Speaker 4>so my argument is that</v>

1621
01:13:03.880 --> 01:13:05.890
<v Speaker 4>disagreeing with carbon,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dating,</v>

1622
01:13:05.891 --> 01:13:10.891
<v Speaker 4>disagreeing with the scientific view of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the earth is very similar to disagreeing</v>

1623
01:13:12.851 --> 01:13:15.130
<v Speaker 4>with kind of the standard model of</v>
<v Speaker 4>history,</v>

1624
01:13:15.160 --> 01:13:17.920
<v Speaker 4>standard monitor of the JFK</v>
<v Speaker 4>assassination.</v>

1625
01:13:17.921 --> 01:13:21.910
<v Speaker 4>As told I the US government.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hate to use the term official story</v>

1626
01:13:22.360 --> 01:13:25.190
<v Speaker 4>because I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've never read called the ls.</v>

1627
01:13:26.590 --> 01:13:29.020
<v Speaker 4>I've never read the Warren Commission</v>
<v Speaker 4>report.</v>

1628
01:13:29.290 --> 01:13:32.740
<v Speaker 4>I've never read the nine slash 11</v>
<v Speaker 4>commission report to be honest.</v>

1629
01:13:32.800 --> 01:13:36.880
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what's in them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I can tell you what happened to</v>

1630
01:13:36.881 --> 01:13:39.880
<v Speaker 4>Kennedy and I can tell you what happened</v>
<v Speaker 4>to what happened on nine slash 11</v>

1631
01:13:39.881 --> 01:13:43.060
<v Speaker 4>according to what I would call our</v>
<v Speaker 4>standard model of history,</v>

1632
01:13:43.540 --> 01:13:47.800
<v Speaker 4>which probably agrees and most respect</v>
<v Speaker 4>with the quote unquote official story.</v>

1633
01:13:47.860 --> 01:13:51.010
<v Speaker 4>The issue with the standard model of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>history of those is disseminated by the</v>

1634
01:13:51.011 --> 01:13:53.920
<v Speaker 4>US government.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People find easy to distrust.</v>

1635
01:13:53.950 --> 01:13:54.783
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not.</v>

1636
01:13:55.240 --> 01:13:56.080
<v Speaker 4>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

1637
01:13:56.470 --> 01:13:59.830
<v Speaker 4>When you were watching it on that</v>
<v Speaker 4>morning when you had your tv on,</v>

1638
01:13:59.831 --> 01:14:01.720
<v Speaker 4>you're watching the towers fall and</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're.</v>

1639
01:14:01.940 --> 01:14:03.610
<v Speaker 4>You've got broadcasters with the</v>
<v Speaker 4>microphone.</v>

1640
01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:05.710
<v Speaker 4>They were not being influenced by the</v>
<v Speaker 4>government.</v>

1641
01:14:05.711 --> 01:14:08.350
<v Speaker 4>They didn't have an earpiece in with</v>
<v Speaker 4>someone from the CIA telling them what</v>

1642
01:14:08.351 --> 01:14:10.900
<v Speaker 4>to say next.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You were pretty much watching it happen</v>

1643
01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:12.430
<v Speaker 4>through no government</v>

1644
01:14:12.430 --> 01:14:14.650
<v Speaker 2>filter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh right,</v>

1645
01:14:14.651 --> 01:14:16.480
<v Speaker 2>but wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when you're talking about the</v>

1646
01:14:16.481 --> 01:14:20.080
<v Speaker 2>official story of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not the news being told as the</v>

1647
01:14:20.081 --> 01:14:22.900
<v Speaker 2>event goes down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the explanation of why the event</v>

1648
01:14:22.901 --> 01:14:25.210
<v Speaker 2>took place after the fact that people</v>
<v Speaker 2>disagree with.</v>

1649
01:14:25.440 --> 01:14:27.880
<v Speaker 2>They don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one disagrees that the towers fell</v>

1650
01:14:27.881 --> 01:14:28.810
<v Speaker 2>with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Planes hit them.</v>

1651
01:14:28.840 --> 01:14:31.060
<v Speaker 2>Sure they do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's people who think the planes were</v>

1652
01:14:31.061 --> 01:14:32.380
<v Speaker 2>holographs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1653
01:14:32.381 --> 01:14:34.520
<v Speaker 2>You getting really crazy though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

1654
01:14:34.540 --> 01:14:38.050
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's all of these different theories</v>

1655
01:14:38.051 --> 01:14:39.760
<v Speaker 2>and while there's people that believe</v>
<v Speaker 2>the earth is hollow,</v>

1656
01:14:39.761 --> 01:14:40.780
<v Speaker 2>there's people that believe that life</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

1657
01:14:40.781 --> 01:14:42.850
<v Speaker 2>but a dream.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Merrily,</v>

1658
01:14:42.851 --> 01:14:43.631
<v Speaker 2>merrily,</v>
<v Speaker 2>merrily,</v>

1659
01:14:43.631 --> 01:14:45.450
<v Speaker 2>merrily,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hollow,</v>

1660
01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:47.140
<v Speaker 2>earth stories are awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're awesome.</v>

1661
01:14:47.170 --> 01:14:48.220
<v Speaker 2>They're all awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

1662
01:14:48.310 --> 01:14:50.260
<v Speaker 2>I've talked to those people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were fucking crazy.</v>

1663
01:14:50.590 --> 01:14:51.161
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1664
01:14:51.161 --> 01:14:52.720
<v Speaker 2>people are nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know there there's people that</v>

1665
01:14:52.721 --> 01:14:54.310
<v Speaker 2>walked down the street and talk to</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that aren't there.</v>

1666
01:14:54.730 --> 01:14:57.580
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't mean that the government is</v>
<v Speaker 2>correct about Kennedy.</v>

1667
01:14:57.900 --> 01:15:00.100
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't mean that Lee Harvey Oswald</v>
<v Speaker 2>acted alone.</v>

1668
01:15:00.101 --> 01:15:05.101
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean that there's no nothing</v>
<v Speaker 2>other than the reason to conclude that a</v>

1669
01:15:05.411 --> 01:15:10.210
<v Speaker 2>single bullet in info inflicted all that</v>
<v Speaker 2>damage is nothing other than their need</v>

1670
01:15:10.211 --> 01:15:13.210
<v Speaker 2>to tie up the fact that they'd committed</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the idea of three bullets,</v>

1671
01:15:13.450 --> 01:15:16.090
<v Speaker 2>that that would be the only thing that</v>
<v Speaker 2>would be logical that this guy could get</v>

1672
01:15:16.091 --> 01:15:16.421
<v Speaker 2>off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They.</v>

1673
01:15:16.421 --> 01:15:18.100
<v Speaker 2>Nobody thought he could get off four</v>
<v Speaker 2>bullets.</v>

1674
01:15:18.280 --> 01:15:20.170
<v Speaker 2>That was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's two crazy three.</v>

1675
01:15:20.500 --> 01:15:22.540
<v Speaker 2>Maybe he could fucking boom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>boom,</v>

1676
01:15:22.740 --> 01:15:24.430
<v Speaker 2>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and get all three bullets in five</v>

1677
01:15:24.431 --> 01:15:27.660
<v Speaker 2>seconds with a milk road car Canto</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chicago.</v>

1678
01:15:28.790 --> 01:15:31.420
<v Speaker 2>When we were talking about that before I</v>
<v Speaker 2>was desperately on my ipad here.</v>

1679
01:15:31.421 --> 01:15:34.240
<v Speaker 2>I was trying to look up because at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>beginning of my episode I did a</v>

1680
01:15:34.241 --> 01:15:39.220
<v Speaker 2>recreation of the time of the Pouch</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pouch.</v>

1681
01:15:39.730 --> 01:15:43.240
<v Speaker 2>And then it's a long hell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a long pause until the final shot pouch</v>

1682
01:15:43.530 --> 01:15:45.880
<v Speaker 2>shows it's something like nine seconds</v>
<v Speaker 2>or something.</v>

1683
01:15:45.880 --> 01:15:47.740
<v Speaker 2>And that's a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe that they're a little less</v>

1684
01:15:47.741 --> 01:15:48.350
<v Speaker 2>than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

1685
01:15:48.350 --> 01:15:50.020
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was five.</v>

1686
01:15:50.200 --> 01:15:52.720
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the space between the last two</v>

1687
01:15:52.721 --> 01:15:56.320
<v Speaker 2>shots that the number of seconds that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're usually told is the space between</v>

1688
01:15:56.321 --> 01:15:57.400
<v Speaker 2>the last one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Also,</v>

1689
01:15:57.460 --> 01:16:01.000
<v Speaker 2>something against the conspiracy that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>would like to point out that people keep</v>

1690
01:16:01.001 --> 01:16:03.760
<v Speaker 2>pointing out was that the scope and that</v>
<v Speaker 2>rifle was off.</v>

1691
01:16:03.790 --> 01:16:06.250
<v Speaker 2>That was one of the things that people</v>
<v Speaker 2>kept saying that the scope and that</v>

1692
01:16:06.260 --> 01:16:07.360
<v Speaker 2>rife,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a bad scope.</v>

1693
01:16:08.410 --> 01:16:12.910
<v Speaker 2>As a someone who's fucked up their scope</v>
<v Speaker 2>before you could just put a rifle down</v>

1694
01:16:12.911 --> 01:16:15.490
<v Speaker 2>hard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you drop it and it falls in the scope,</v>

1695
01:16:15.491 --> 01:16:18.940
<v Speaker 2>bounce off the ground that scopes off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the chain of evidence between Lee</v>

1696
01:16:18.940 --> 01:16:22.270
<v Speaker 2>Harvey on the idea that they found this</v>
<v Speaker 2>scope and it was impossible for them to</v>

1697
01:16:22.271 --> 01:16:25.300
<v Speaker 2>fight with his gun because the scope is</v>
<v Speaker 2>off is preposterous because anybody</v>

1698
01:16:25.301 --> 01:16:28.570
<v Speaker 2>could have dropped that gun after Oswald</v>
<v Speaker 2>left it there and fucked up that scope.</v>

1699
01:16:28.780 --> 01:16:31.930
<v Speaker 2>So the fact that who knows how many days</v>
<v Speaker 2>or hours or whatever,</v>

1700
01:16:31.931 --> 01:16:35.620
<v Speaker 2>later they went to check that scope to</v>
<v Speaker 2>see if it was cited in that stupid</v>

1701
01:16:35.800 --> 01:16:38.110
<v Speaker 2>hunters have to cite their scopes and</v>
<v Speaker 2>after every trip,</v>

1702
01:16:38.170 --> 01:16:43.060
<v Speaker 2>every time you put your stuff in luggage</v>
<v Speaker 2>packed in with all this like cushioning</v>

1703
01:16:43.061 --> 01:16:46.030
<v Speaker 2>and everything that makes sure in hard</v>
<v Speaker 2>cases you still have to recite your</v>

1704
01:16:46.031 --> 01:16:49.030
<v Speaker 2>scope and you get to a range.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to because to be ethical,</v>

1705
01:16:49.031 --> 01:16:52.150
<v Speaker 2>to make sure that you hit the animal</v>
<v Speaker 2>where you want to hit it because they go</v>

1706
01:16:52.151 --> 01:16:53.500
<v Speaker 2>off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they bounce around,</v>

1707
01:16:53.501 --> 01:16:55.640
<v Speaker 2>they move.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Same issue with telescopes.</v>

1708
01:16:55.780 --> 01:17:00.310
<v Speaker 2>The sites on those are very similar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I mean that doesn't mean though that</v>

1709
01:17:00.430 --> 01:17:03.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole ball of wax,</v>

1710
01:17:03.220 --> 01:17:06.490
<v Speaker 2>the whole government story is exactly</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happened.</v>

1711
01:17:06.491 --> 01:17:08.710
<v Speaker 2>We're chasing ghosts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Were talking about some shit from the</v>

1712
01:17:08.720 --> 01:17:12.740
<v Speaker 2>sixties and trying to piece it together</v>
<v Speaker 2>and say case closed I think is</v>

1713
01:17:12.741 --> 01:17:13.550
<v Speaker 2>preposterous.</v>

1714
01:17:13.550 --> 01:17:16.580
<v Speaker 2>I think it's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do think it's fascinating and I do</v>

1715
01:17:16.581 --> 01:17:20.390
<v Speaker 2>think that people can lose their mind</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in and chasing it down and</v>

1716
01:17:20.410 --> 01:17:23.450
<v Speaker 2>investigating it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I certainly did myself back in</v>

1717
01:17:23.480 --> 01:17:26.390
<v Speaker 2>Pennsylvania when I was working at that</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking club,</v>

1718
01:17:26.660 --> 01:17:29.960
<v Speaker 2>reading that stupid book all day and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then going on stage that night and just</v>

1719
01:17:30.080 --> 01:17:32.300
<v Speaker 2>bombing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I had two shows that night in the</v>

1720
01:17:32.301 --> 01:17:34.670
<v Speaker 2>first show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just ate a plate of shit.</v>

1721
01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.190
<v Speaker 2>And then the second show I pulled it</v>
<v Speaker 2>together and got back.</v>

1722
01:17:37.191 --> 01:17:38.900
<v Speaker 2>But I was depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

1723
01:17:38.901 --> 01:17:39.560
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what were you?</v>

1724
01:17:39.560 --> 01:17:42.330
<v Speaker 2>Were you were your child or getting your</v>
<v Speaker 2>material are always.</v>

1725
01:17:42.340 --> 01:17:42.981
<v Speaker 2>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1726
01:17:42.981 --> 01:17:43.970
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's my mindset.</v>

1727
01:17:43.971 --> 01:17:47.930
<v Speaker 2>I've had to really distinctive times</v>
<v Speaker 2>where the things that I saw before I</v>

1728
01:17:47.931 --> 01:17:50.960
<v Speaker 2>went on stage fucked me up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was a big one.</v>

1729
01:17:50.990 --> 01:17:53.750
<v Speaker 2>That was probably the first one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Might have been the second one.</v>

1730
01:17:53.750 --> 01:17:55.250
<v Speaker 2>It was all the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a slow learner.</v>

1731
01:17:55.640 --> 01:18:00.500
<v Speaker 2>But the other one was I went with</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy named jb smooth,</v>

1732
01:18:00.510 --> 01:18:03.470
<v Speaker 2>you know jb smoove funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's hilarious.</v>

1733
01:18:03.471 --> 01:18:08.030
<v Speaker 2>And Jb and I were doing a college</v>
<v Speaker 2>together in New Jersey and jb was,</v>

1734
01:18:08.210 --> 01:18:10.530
<v Speaker 2>it was really hard to find.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Jb was,</v>

1735
01:18:10.880 --> 01:18:13.850
<v Speaker 2>he was running late,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they had me go on first and I wasn't</v>

1736
01:18:13.851 --> 01:18:18.380
<v Speaker 2>prepared because I was sitting in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>little rec room with a TV on and the TV</v>

1737
01:18:18.381 --> 01:18:20.810
<v Speaker 2>was showing this documentary on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Malibu fires.</v>

1738
01:18:21.810 --> 01:18:24.560
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was so fucking depressing.</v>

1739
01:18:24.590 --> 01:18:28.400
<v Speaker 2>It was the early nineties and these</v>
<v Speaker 2>people lost everything and this guy was</v>

1740
01:18:28.401 --> 01:18:31.400
<v Speaker 2>crying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was a fireman and he was crying and</v>

1741
01:18:31.401 --> 01:18:32.810
<v Speaker 2>weeping.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His house was still there,</v>

1742
01:18:32.930 --> 01:18:36.620
<v Speaker 2>but it's neighbors had lost their houses</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he was just crying and weeping.</v>

1743
01:18:36.621 --> 01:18:38.780
<v Speaker 2>This girl was looking for her dog and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>

1744
01:18:38.940 --> 01:18:41.990
<v Speaker 2>all right Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm jb is still late.</v>

1745
01:18:41.990 --> 01:18:44.960
<v Speaker 2>So what we're gonna do is we're going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>put you on and you do your sat and then</v>

1746
01:18:44.961 --> 01:18:46.670
<v Speaker 2>he'll go on after you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1747
01:18:46.700 --> 01:18:49.640
<v Speaker 2>oh no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I went on stage thinking about this</v>

1748
01:18:49.641 --> 01:18:52.730
<v Speaker 2>guy crying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not even for his own loss but for his</v>

1749
01:18:52.731 --> 01:18:54.980
<v Speaker 2>neighbors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Last and that girl looking for a dog.</v>

1750
01:18:54.981 --> 01:18:59.981
<v Speaker 2>And I just got so sad and I went on</v>
<v Speaker 2>stage at a shit that just title,</v>

1751
01:19:00.790 --> 01:19:03.560
<v Speaker 2>even Japan really messed me up for a few</v>
<v Speaker 2>days.</v>

1752
01:19:03.710 --> 01:19:06.890
<v Speaker 2>I was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'd been to Japan just a few years</v>

1753
01:19:06.890 --> 01:19:10.430
<v Speaker 2>before and man just seeing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seeing all that destruction and you just</v>

1754
01:19:10.431 --> 01:19:11.440
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1755
01:19:11.450 --> 01:19:13.430
<v Speaker 2>watching those rivers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Washington on the streets and</v>

1756
01:19:13.431 --> 01:19:14.061
<v Speaker 2>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1757
01:19:14.061 --> 01:19:16.050
<v Speaker 2>it's full of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was a,</v>

1758
01:19:16.280 --> 01:19:18.200
<v Speaker 2>I was messed up for days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1759
01:19:18.201 --> 01:19:21.620
<v Speaker 2>it's horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So those comedy required.</v>

1760
01:19:21.621 --> 01:19:22.011
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1761
01:19:22.011 --> 01:19:25.940
<v Speaker 2>people are paying to see you take them</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of this reality and have them escape</v>

1762
01:19:25.941 --> 01:19:26.990
<v Speaker 2>into some fun world.</v>

1763
01:19:28.540 --> 01:19:29.620
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't good at it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1764
01:19:29.740 --> 01:19:31.460
<v Speaker 2>it was only.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was only 20,</v>

1765
01:19:31.461 --> 01:19:34.580
<v Speaker 2>maybe 23 or something at the time I just</v>
<v Speaker 2>was clumsy.</v>

1766
01:19:34.581 --> 01:19:38.240
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know what the fuck I was doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the idea of reading this conspiracy</v>

1767
01:19:38.241 --> 01:19:41.770
<v Speaker 2>book all day and freaking out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I also was bad at perspective.</v>

1768
01:19:41.840 --> 01:19:43.120
<v Speaker 2>Putting things in portfolio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>

1769
01:19:43.121 --> 01:19:44.600
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this took place in [inaudible] 63.</v>

1770
01:19:44.810 --> 01:19:46.640
<v Speaker 2>Here we are and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>1990.</v>

1771
01:19:46.641 --> 01:19:48.050
<v Speaker 2>Why am I thinking about this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1772
01:19:48.320 --> 01:19:51.200
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have that ability to switch</v>
<v Speaker 2>gears.</v>

1773
01:19:51.260 --> 01:19:53.210
<v Speaker 2>So interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I stand up.</v>

1774
01:19:53.211 --> 01:19:55.820
<v Speaker 2>Comedy is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is one of the careers that I have the</v>

1775
01:19:55.821 --> 01:20:00.821
<v Speaker 2>most respect for because you can't not</v>
<v Speaker 2>be smart and get away with it.</v>

1776
01:20:01.701 --> 01:20:03.280
<v Speaker 2>You've obviously never seen Brian</v>
<v Speaker 2>onstage.</v>

1777
01:20:03.900 --> 01:20:07.300
<v Speaker 2>He kills and he's not smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got it.</v>

1778
01:20:07.500 --> 01:20:07.980
<v Speaker 2>You've got to</v>

1779
01:20:07.980 --> 01:20:10.620
<v Speaker 4>be a great speaker.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've got to be good on your feet.</v>

1780
01:20:10.680 --> 01:20:11.120
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1781
01:20:11.120 --> 01:20:13.440
<v Speaker 4>I'm just impressed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not a good speaker.</v>

1782
01:20:13.441 --> 01:20:14.710
<v Speaker 4>I barely can talk,</v>
<v Speaker 4>talk.</v>

1783
01:20:14.730 --> 01:20:16.120
<v Speaker 4>So he's got worms in his mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1784
01:20:16.140 --> 01:20:17.910
<v Speaker 4>My,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my theory is disproven.</v>

1785
01:20:17.911 --> 01:20:18.391
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

1786
01:20:18.391 --> 01:20:19.710
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he also has a cheat code.</v>

1787
01:20:20.290 --> 01:20:23.610
<v Speaker 4>He's got the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the God code became famous and then he</v>

1788
01:20:23.611 --> 01:20:27.600
<v Speaker 4>started doing comedy again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's your prop comedy without a proper</v>

1789
01:20:28.310 --> 01:20:33.000
<v Speaker 4>profit is his personality.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1790
01:20:33.001 --> 01:20:33.630
<v Speaker 4>thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1791
01:20:33.630 --> 01:20:35.540
<v Speaker 4>that's very nice of you to say.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1792
01:20:35.541 --> 01:20:36.374
<v Speaker 4>it's a.</v>

1793
01:20:36.470 --> 01:20:40.040
<v Speaker 2>my friend Joey Diaz says it best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He says it's the hardest,</v>

1794
01:20:40.041 --> 01:20:42.680
<v Speaker 2>easiest thing you'll ever do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you're good at it and you get good</v>

1795
01:20:42.681 --> 01:20:44.930
<v Speaker 2>at it and you stay at it and you develop</v>
<v Speaker 2>momentum,</v>

1796
01:20:44.990 --> 01:20:47.150
<v Speaker 2>then it's easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But to get to that point,</v>

1797
01:20:47.151 --> 01:20:48.780
<v Speaker 2>it's very hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that,</v>

1798
01:20:48.860 --> 01:20:52.400
<v Speaker 2>that was my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my birth or my.</v>

1799
01:20:52.620 --> 01:20:56.720
<v Speaker 2>I'm entering into the world of</v>
<v Speaker 2>conspiracies and the fascination with</v>

1800
01:20:56.721 --> 01:20:59.180
<v Speaker 2>them came from that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from that one book,</v>

1801
01:20:59.440 --> 01:21:01.940
<v Speaker 2>100 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no doubt about it.</v>

1802
01:21:01.941 --> 01:21:05.530
<v Speaker 2>That I can trace it back to that one</v>
<v Speaker 2>book that made me start questioning</v>

1803
01:21:05.550 --> 01:21:08.630
<v Speaker 2>reality of what I'd been taught.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are there other roads you've gone down</v>

1804
01:21:08.631 --> 01:21:09.320
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1805
01:21:09.320 --> 01:21:12.200
<v Speaker 2>that you've since turned away from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Moon landings?</v>

1806
01:21:12.570 --> 01:21:14.240
<v Speaker 2>Most drastic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like again,</v>

1807
01:21:14.270 --> 01:21:15.440
<v Speaker 2>I say for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1808
01:21:15.500 --> 01:21:20.500
<v Speaker 2>just as a caveat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always wish the moon landing was fake</v>

1809
01:21:20.930 --> 01:21:23.930
<v Speaker 2>and I would be much more happy if it</v>
<v Speaker 2>turned out it was a giant hoax then if</v>

1810
01:21:23.931 --> 01:21:25.610
<v Speaker 2>people went to the moon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>

1811
01:21:25.940 --> 01:21:29.270
<v Speaker 2>Because I'm a silly bitch and because I</v>
<v Speaker 2>like silly things and I love,</v>

1812
01:21:29.271 --> 01:21:32.420
<v Speaker 2>I think it'd be a greater accomplishment</v>
<v Speaker 2>for people to fake that we went to the</v>

1813
01:21:32.421 --> 01:21:34.340
<v Speaker 2>moon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would almost even be to go to the</v>

1814
01:21:34.341 --> 01:21:36.230
<v Speaker 2>moon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1815
01:21:36.320 --> 01:21:37.490
<v Speaker 2>that was what Neil said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1816
01:21:37.550 --> 01:21:39.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's also with the,</v>

1817
01:21:39.371 --> 01:21:40.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1818
01:21:40.520 --> 01:21:43.310
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people that have argued against</v>
<v Speaker 2>it have said,</v>

1819
01:21:43.570 --> 01:21:45.550
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>science even scientifically that it</v>

1820
01:21:45.560 --> 01:21:46.400
<v Speaker 2>would be more impressive.</v>

1821
01:21:46.680 --> 01:21:48.370
<v Speaker 4>It would.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think,</v>

1822
01:21:48.371 --> 01:21:48.860
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1823
01:21:48.860 --> 01:21:49.990
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the point that,</v>

1824
01:21:49.991 --> 01:21:51.850
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the number of people who would be</v>

1825
01:21:51.851 --> 01:21:54.800
<v Speaker 4>expected to keep a secret as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1826
01:21:54.830 --> 01:21:56.080
<v Speaker 4>This is something that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1827
01:21:56.110 --> 01:21:59.380
<v Speaker 4>we have a road.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We went down with the flight was flight</v>

1828
01:21:59.381 --> 01:22:03.580
<v Speaker 4>93 or flight 77 flight 93 was the one</v>
<v Speaker 4>that got shot down over Pennsylvania 93.</v>

1829
01:22:03.700 --> 01:22:08.440
<v Speaker 4>So I've got a friend who does not</v>
<v Speaker 4>believe in any of the nine slash 11</v>

1830
01:22:08.441 --> 01:22:11.620
<v Speaker 4>conspiracies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>except he believes that we did</v>

1831
01:22:11.621 --> 01:22:13.300
<v Speaker 4>successfully shoot down that plane.</v>

1832
01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.760
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will tell you this without saying</v>

1833
01:22:16.761 --> 01:22:21.260
<v Speaker 2>anyone's name or speaking any further</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I know people that are in the</v>

1834
01:22:21.261 --> 01:22:26.060
<v Speaker 2>military and I asked them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it possible that in a situation where</v>

1835
01:22:26.061 --> 01:22:28.940
<v Speaker 2>a plane was going to be flown into the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pentagon,</v>

1836
01:22:28.941 --> 01:22:31.460
<v Speaker 2>that they would have fighter jets it out</v>
<v Speaker 2>of Scott?</v>

1837
01:22:31.520 --> 01:22:34.640
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that would be possible?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they said 100 percent.</v>

1838
01:22:34.790 --> 01:22:36.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One hundred percent possible.</v>

1839
01:22:36.240 --> 01:22:37.890
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we would do it.</v>

1840
01:22:38.060 --> 01:22:40.140
<v Speaker 4>We had to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We had plans on the way to do it.</v>

1841
01:22:40.160 --> 01:22:41.940
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They didn't get there in time.</v>

1842
01:22:42.590 --> 01:22:43.700
<v Speaker 4>Allegedly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1843
01:22:43.720 --> 01:22:44.331
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1844
01:22:44.331 --> 01:22:46.410
<v Speaker 4>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have no problem with the fact that</v>

1845
01:22:46.411 --> 01:22:48.240
<v Speaker 4>they were on the way to get it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

1846
01:22:48.280 --> 01:22:51.270
<v Speaker 4>but the thing is that that's another</v>
<v Speaker 4>case where you got to look at the number</v>

1847
01:22:51.271 --> 01:22:53.760
<v Speaker 4>of people involved because if a missile</v>
<v Speaker 4>gets shot,</v>

1848
01:22:54.630 --> 01:22:58.380
<v Speaker 4>a missile getting shot is a big deal</v>
<v Speaker 4>because you've got all kinds of</v>

1849
01:22:58.381 --> 01:23:00.310
<v Speaker 4>accounting that has to happen for that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not,</v>

1850
01:23:00.340 --> 01:23:02.670
<v Speaker 4>not only do you have the ground crew and</v>
<v Speaker 4>everyone's supposed to spend this long</v>

1851
01:23:02.690 --> 01:23:05.350
<v Speaker 4>just shakes it off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've got civilian oversight for all</v>

1852
01:23:05.351 --> 01:23:07.570
<v Speaker 4>the supplies that happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>

1853
01:23:07.571 --> 01:23:10.000
<v Speaker 4>for a plane to shoot a missile that</v>
<v Speaker 4>nobody knows about,</v>

1854
01:23:10.480 --> 01:23:13.070
<v Speaker 4>that's again going to involve,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1855
01:23:13.090 --> 01:23:14.950
<v Speaker 4>a pyramid of people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1856
01:23:15.310 --> 01:23:17.530
<v Speaker 4>100 people at the base may be at a</v>
<v Speaker 4>minimum,</v>

1857
01:23:18.040 --> 01:23:21.580
<v Speaker 4>a thousand people in the civilian</v>
<v Speaker 4>oversight contractors.</v>

1858
01:23:21.790 --> 01:23:25.560
<v Speaker 4>It just goes on and on and on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The number of people that would have</v>

1859
01:23:25.580 --> 01:23:27.870
<v Speaker 4>wished that I could agree with that I,</v>

1860
01:23:28.210 --> 01:23:31.690
<v Speaker 1>but I can't because of the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have black funded projects because</v>

1861
01:23:31.691 --> 01:23:36.160
<v Speaker 1>of the fact that they develop things in</v>
<v Speaker 1>total complete secrecy in area 51 that</v>

1862
01:23:36.161 --> 01:23:37.930
<v Speaker 1>involve billions and billions of</v>
<v Speaker 1>dollars.</v>

1863
01:23:37.931 --> 01:23:42.010
<v Speaker 1>That's where the technology came from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where you know many different</v>

1864
01:23:42.220 --> 01:23:45.280
<v Speaker 1>advanced technologies have come from</v>
<v Speaker 1>without any knowledge whatsoever by the</v>

1865
01:23:45.281 --> 01:23:48.460
<v Speaker 1>American people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So to say that it would be hard to hide</v>

1866
01:23:48.461 --> 01:23:51.010
<v Speaker 1>a missile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would certainly be an issue.</v>

1867
01:23:51.220 --> 01:23:53.920
<v Speaker 1>We'd certainly be an issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think that a government that</v>

1868
01:23:53.921 --> 01:23:56.740
<v Speaker 1>could make a fucking stealth bomber</v>
<v Speaker 1>would have a hard time hiding a missile.</v>

1869
01:23:56.780 --> 01:23:58.850
<v Speaker 4>Well okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But these planes did not come from area</v>

1870
01:23:58.851 --> 01:24:01.880
<v Speaker 4>51.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They can totally open basis trail walk</v>

1871
01:24:01.881 --> 01:24:02.990
<v Speaker 4>on and off of it day.</v>

1872
01:24:03.030 --> 01:24:04.110
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you can.</v>

1873
01:24:04.200 --> 01:24:06.720
<v Speaker 1>Well people walk on and off of the area,</v>
<v Speaker 1>51 everyday too.</v>

1874
01:24:06.721 --> 01:24:10.080
<v Speaker 1>They just come in by buses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just come in on planes and buses</v>

1875
01:24:10.081 --> 01:24:11.250
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from Vegas.</v>

1876
01:24:11.251 --> 01:24:14.450
<v Speaker 1>But that doesn't necessarily mean that</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

1877
01:24:14.470 --> 01:24:16.290
<v Speaker 1>that's what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it does.</v>

1878
01:24:16.650 --> 01:24:19.560
<v Speaker 1>The idea of saying this could never</v>
<v Speaker 1>happen because you would have too many</v>

1879
01:24:19.561 --> 01:24:23.340
<v Speaker 1>people not really think about all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit that they have designed that no one</v>

1880
01:24:23.341 --> 01:24:27.150
<v Speaker 1>knew they had until they had this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of secrecy still in</v>

1881
01:24:27.151 --> 01:24:29.310
<v Speaker 1>government when they do it right and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're really good at it.</v>

1882
01:24:29.430 --> 01:24:31.790
<v Speaker 1>When it comes to national security,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can keep things take,</v>

1883
01:24:32.050 --> 01:24:33.460
<v Speaker 4>but.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But also those things weren't all that</v>

1884
01:24:33.461 --> 01:24:34.960
<v Speaker 4>remarkable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was nothing.</v>

1885
01:24:35.230 --> 01:24:38.470
<v Speaker 4>Nothing that ever happened at area 51</v>
<v Speaker 4>turned out to really be all that</v>

1886
01:24:38.471 --> 01:24:39.460
<v Speaker 4>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Blackbird.</v>

1887
01:24:40.010 --> 01:24:40.300
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1888
01:24:40.300 --> 01:24:43.690
<v Speaker 1>You don't think that that's remarkable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These unbelievable jets.</v>

1889
01:24:43.720 --> 01:24:45.730
<v Speaker 1>You don't think that stealth technology</v>
<v Speaker 1>is remarkable.</v>

1890
01:24:45.731 --> 01:24:48.910
<v Speaker 1>The fact that they look like Ufo and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can hide from radar.</v>

1891
01:24:49.310 --> 01:24:50.360
<v Speaker 1>God Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're hard.</v>

1892
01:24:50.710 --> 01:24:53.060
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I go to google.</v>

1893
01:24:53.190 --> 01:24:56.520
<v Speaker 4>Com.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Google came from really area 51.</v>

1894
01:24:57.060 --> 01:24:57.750
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're joking.</v>

1895
01:24:57.750 --> 01:24:58.380
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's.</v>

1896
01:24:58.380 --> 01:24:59.850
<v Speaker 4>There's being.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1897
01:24:59.851 --> 01:25:03.030
<v Speaker 4>I'm buying it and anyone can get</v>
<v Speaker 4>started.</v>

1898
01:25:03.180 --> 01:25:06.660
<v Speaker 4>I'm a big aerospace nut and I follow a</v>
<v Speaker 4>lot of the aerospace reporting and</v>

1899
01:25:06.661 --> 01:25:10.110
<v Speaker 4>anyone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>anyone in that industry knows what goes</v>

1900
01:25:10.111 --> 01:25:13.130
<v Speaker 4>on at area 51 because it's basically</v>
<v Speaker 4>the.</v>

1901
01:25:13.360 --> 01:25:15.660
<v Speaker 4>It's the national test facility is what</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's actually called.</v>

1902
01:25:15.930 --> 01:25:17.610
<v Speaker 4>They simply,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's where they're testing the next</v>

1903
01:25:17.611 --> 01:25:21.210
<v Speaker 4>generation planes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't be surprised to see what</v>

1904
01:25:21.211 --> 01:25:22.230
<v Speaker 4>they're testing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're now,</v>

1905
01:25:22.630 --> 01:25:24.540
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because we pretty much have a pretty</v>

1906
01:25:24.541 --> 01:25:26.480
<v Speaker 4>good idea of what it looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's the,</v>

1907
01:25:26.640 --> 01:25:29.790
<v Speaker 4>that was the case in the 19 sixties was</v>
<v Speaker 4>the case in the 19 seventies.</v>

1908
01:25:29.850 --> 01:25:34.040
<v Speaker 4>You've obviously never seen the</v>
<v Speaker 4>interviews with Robert Lasar know our</v>

1909
01:25:34.050 --> 01:25:35.970
<v Speaker 4>favorite guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>

1910
01:25:36.150 --> 01:25:36.960
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have.</v>

1911
01:25:36.960 --> 01:25:38.120
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know all about Bob.</v>

1912
01:25:38.130 --> 01:25:38.600
<v Speaker 4>Hello?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sorry.</v>

1913
01:25:38.600 --> 01:25:39.170
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1914
01:25:39.170 --> 01:25:40.700
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did a whole episode on,</v>

1915
01:25:40.740 --> 01:25:43.940
<v Speaker 4>on his thing as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a fascinating cat because he seems</v>

1916
01:25:43.941 --> 01:25:44.850
<v Speaker 4>so smart.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then you finally,</v>

1917
01:25:44.880 --> 01:25:46.610
<v Speaker 4>he lied about his college education</v>
<v Speaker 4>know.</v>

1918
01:25:46.800 --> 01:25:48.840
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you might be crazy.</v>

1919
01:25:49.370 --> 01:25:49.910
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That,</v>

1920
01:25:49.910 --> 01:25:50.721
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was a,</v>

1921
01:25:50.721 --> 01:25:53.840
<v Speaker 4>that was really quite a wonder.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But anyone who is in the note was</v>

1922
01:25:53.841 --> 01:25:55.250
<v Speaker 4>laughing at him from the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1923
01:25:55.251 --> 01:25:57.650
<v Speaker 4>really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Only fooled people in the Ufo community.</v>

1924
01:25:57.920 --> 01:25:59.580
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sounds like an ad hominem attack,</v>

1925
01:25:59.581 --> 01:26:02.120
<v Speaker 1>sir.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that doesn't do very much to support</v>

1926
01:26:02.121 --> 01:26:04.280
<v Speaker 1>your arguments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1927
01:26:04.360 --> 01:26:05.990
<v Speaker 2>was terrible debating skill you have</v>
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>

1928
01:26:05.991 --> 01:26:09.320
<v Speaker 2>Brian Dunning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was wrong because of who he is to the</v>

1929
01:26:09.321 --> 01:26:10.550
<v Speaker 2>end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1930
01:26:10.790 --> 01:26:14.270
<v Speaker 2>nobody wants us to be real more than me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like nobody wants to dig for it to be</v>

1931
01:26:14.271 --> 01:26:16.190
<v Speaker 2>real more than me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I'm silly.</v>

1932
01:26:16.250 --> 01:26:17.810
<v Speaker 2>I'm a silly person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a comedian,</v>

1933
01:26:18.240 --> 01:26:20.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have any vested interest in</v>

1934
01:26:20.031 --> 01:26:24.320
<v Speaker 2>keeping the status quo and standard</v>
<v Speaker 2>operational procedure in place.</v>

1935
01:26:24.321 --> 01:26:27.920
<v Speaker 2>I like it all falling apart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would love it if a Ufo flood flow over</v>

1936
01:26:27.921 --> 01:26:31.220
<v Speaker 2>the city and people started shitting</v>
<v Speaker 2>their pants and throwing bed pans out</v>

1937
01:26:31.221 --> 01:26:32.360
<v Speaker 2>the windows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would love it.</v>

1938
01:26:32.490 --> 01:26:34.850
<v Speaker 2>I told you what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I first got here to the studio,</v>

1939
01:26:34.851 --> 01:26:39.851
<v Speaker 2>I told you that bigfoot is something</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I believed in until five years ago.</v>

1940
01:26:40.490 --> 01:26:42.170
<v Speaker 2>Fairly recent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1941
01:26:42.171 --> 01:26:44.690
<v Speaker 2>not just that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You said you believe the Patterson</v>

1942
01:26:44.690 --> 01:26:46.250
<v Speaker 2>Gimlin footage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1943
01:26:46.251 --> 01:26:46.910
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1944
01:26:46.910 --> 01:26:49.880
<v Speaker 2>I always believed that the Patterson</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gimlin footage,</v>

1945
01:26:50.120 --> 01:26:53.050
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do I just call it pattern and Kim</v>

1946
01:26:53.120 --> 01:26:53.953
<v Speaker 2>leadership.</v>

1947
01:26:54.860 --> 01:26:58.390
<v Speaker 2>I always believed that that looked</v>
<v Speaker 2>incredibly good and I still do now.</v>

1948
01:26:58.880 --> 01:27:01.430
<v Speaker 2>The people who say that's the worst fake</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've ever seen.</v>

1949
01:27:01.520 --> 01:27:05.810
<v Speaker 2>I think they're being disingenuous</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I think it's a brilliant face.</v>

1950
01:27:06.890 --> 01:27:08.810
<v Speaker 2>I think it looks great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're hilarious.</v>

1951
01:27:08.870 --> 01:27:10.790
<v Speaker 2>I know the whole history of the film and</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

1952
01:27:11.290 --> 01:27:13.720
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Bob.</v>

1953
01:27:13.860 --> 01:27:14.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The whole thing with,</v>

1954
01:27:15.020 --> 01:27:16.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when was the film where,</v>

1955
01:27:16.371 --> 01:27:18.350
<v Speaker 2>when was the film purchase?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was it developed?</v>

1956
01:27:18.351 --> 01:27:21.920
<v Speaker 2>How did it get from A to b?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we know that pretty much everything</v>

1957
01:27:21.921 --> 01:27:26.240
<v Speaker 2>he said about it was a lie and we pretty</v>
<v Speaker 2>much have a good picture of the film's</v>

1958
01:27:26.241 --> 01:27:29.930
<v Speaker 2>history and we know that it was faked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We also know that he was arrested for</v>

1959
01:27:29.931 --> 01:27:32.090
<v Speaker 2>larceny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for writing a bad check.</v>

1960
01:27:32.120 --> 01:27:36.980
<v Speaker 2>He was very camera that he used to film</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he had been paid.</v>

1961
01:27:37.010 --> 01:27:40.250
<v Speaker 2>He was on a hunt to make a big foot</v>
<v Speaker 2>documentary for God's sake.</v>

1962
01:27:40.310 --> 01:27:43.590
<v Speaker 2>Don't bring this up to bobcat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Goldthwait crazy.</v>

1963
01:27:44.260 --> 01:27:46.700
<v Speaker 2>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We had on my show.</v>

1964
01:27:46.701 --> 01:27:48.040
<v Speaker 2>I had um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1965
01:27:48.120 --> 01:27:48.650
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's,</v>

1966
01:27:48.650 --> 01:27:50.570
<v Speaker 2>here's the video.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's watch the video real quick just so</v>

1967
01:27:50.571 --> 01:27:53.330
<v Speaker 2>we can show how silly you are that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>think that this looks real.</v>

1968
01:27:55.720 --> 01:27:58.820
<v Speaker 2>The stabilized version,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because this one's horrible because this</v>

1969
01:27:58.821 --> 01:28:02.780
<v Speaker 2>is how it was first released.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was first released in this sort of</v>

1970
01:28:02.781 --> 01:28:03.890
<v Speaker 2>like weird,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shaky,</v>

1971
01:28:03.891 --> 01:28:05.550
<v Speaker 2>shaky version.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1972
01:28:05.740 --> 01:28:08.210
<v Speaker 2>this is actually probably stabilized</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it,</v>

1973
01:28:08.730 --> 01:28:10.810
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that looks so stupid and fake.</v>

1974
01:28:12.390 --> 01:28:14.870
<v Speaker 2>How can you say it looks fake because</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so bad quality.</v>

1975
01:28:14.900 --> 01:28:17.540
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If there was anything in there that gave</v>

1976
01:28:17.541 --> 01:28:18.650
<v Speaker 2>it away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a Zipper,</v>

1977
01:28:18.651 --> 01:28:21.500
<v Speaker 2>it wouldn't be visible because of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>low graininess the way he walks.</v>

1978
01:28:21.530 --> 01:28:23.210
<v Speaker 2>He walks like a person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1979
01:28:23.211 --> 01:28:24.980
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't mean that it's not a big</v>
<v Speaker 2>giant person,</v>

1980
01:28:24.981 --> 01:28:28.730
<v Speaker 2>but he walks like a person and I don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>think when you watch an elephant walk,</v>

1981
01:28:28.790 --> 01:28:30.740
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a reality to the weight that</v>

1982
01:28:30.741 --> 01:28:34.400
<v Speaker 2>they carry around and that thing is not</v>
<v Speaker 2>walking with the reality of the weight</v>

1983
01:28:34.401 --> 01:28:36.980
<v Speaker 2>of an 800 pound,</v>
<v Speaker 2>1000 pound animal.</v>

1984
01:28:37.100 --> 01:28:38.930
<v Speaker 2>That thing is walking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe he's,</v>

1985
01:28:39.740 --> 01:28:40.760
<v Speaker 2>maybe he's five,</v>
<v Speaker 2>six.</v>

1986
01:28:41.490 --> 01:28:44.270
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they decided they were going to measure</v>

1987
01:28:44.271 --> 01:28:47.400
<v Speaker 2>off all the different trees in that area</v>
<v Speaker 2>and figure out how tall he was.</v>

1988
01:28:47.690 --> 01:28:50.690
<v Speaker 2>I didn't say I thought it looked like he</v>
<v Speaker 2>was over six feet tall.</v>

1989
01:28:50.691 --> 01:28:52.220
<v Speaker 2>I said it looked like a real animal to</v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

1990
01:28:52.310 --> 01:28:53.061
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't.</v>

1991
01:28:53.061 --> 01:28:54.710
<v Speaker 2>To me it looks like a guy in a monkey</v>
<v Speaker 2>suit.</v>

1992
01:28:55.070 --> 01:28:58.300
<v Speaker 2>It looks stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm what I'm doing is I'm,</v>

1993
01:28:58.360 --> 01:29:00.770
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm admitting where I have had,</v>

1994
01:29:00.820 --> 01:29:02.190
<v Speaker 2>where susceptible</v>

1995
01:29:02.190 --> 01:29:03.330
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1996
01:29:03.331 --> 01:29:04.710
<v Speaker 4>I wanted big foot to be real.</v>

1997
01:29:04.750 --> 01:29:05.860
<v Speaker 1>I understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in,</v>

1998
01:29:05.890 --> 01:29:08.680
<v Speaker 1>in finding yourself that you were indeed</v>
<v Speaker 1>a silly bitch.</v>

1999
01:29:08.860 --> 01:29:11.710
<v Speaker 1>Now what you're doing is you're bouncing</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other way and going was,</v>

2000
01:29:11.740 --> 01:29:13.060
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>excuse me at the time,</v>

2001
01:29:13.330 --> 01:29:15.700
<v Speaker 1>and now you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're bouncing completely the other way</v>

2002
01:29:15.701 --> 01:29:19.360
<v Speaker 1>and hardcore skeptic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a skeptic by,</v>

2003
01:29:19.450 --> 01:29:20.950
<v Speaker 1>by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not by choice,</v>

2004
01:29:20.951 --> 01:29:22.900
<v Speaker 1>but by default,</v>
<v Speaker 1>instantly,</v>

2005
01:29:22.901 --> 01:29:26.020
<v Speaker 1>automatically lean towards the skeptic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shouldn't we all be?</v>

2006
01:29:26.350 --> 01:29:28.450
<v Speaker 1>I think we should be very objective for</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure,</v>

2007
01:29:28.510 --> 01:29:30.550
<v Speaker 1>and I think it can be very confusing if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not,</v>

2008
01:29:30.770 --> 01:29:32.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you do go looking around for</v>

2009
01:29:32.741 --> 01:29:33.880
<v Speaker 1>conspiracies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2010
01:29:33.881 --> 01:29:37.540
<v Speaker 1>the better alternative is most certainly</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be skeptical by default,</v>

2011
01:29:38.050 --> 01:29:40.330
<v Speaker 1>but I also think that you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you miss a lot of shit.</v>

2012
01:29:40.600 --> 01:29:41.433
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2013
01:29:41.470 --> 01:29:43.270
<v Speaker 1>here's a perfect example and I use this</v>
<v Speaker 1>one all the time.</v>

2014
01:29:43.330 --> 01:29:45.100
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately for people listening to</v>
<v Speaker 1>podcasts.</v>

2015
01:29:45.340 --> 01:29:47.620
<v Speaker 1>Do you believe that nine slash 11</v>
<v Speaker 1>happened?</v>

2016
01:29:48.040 --> 01:29:50.470
<v Speaker 1>Do you believe that planes flew into</v>
<v Speaker 1>buildings?</v>

2017
01:29:50.560 --> 01:29:51.700
<v Speaker 1>Do you believe that happens?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2018
01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:55.000
<v Speaker 1>Then you believe in conspiracies?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2019
01:29:55.210 --> 01:29:55.871
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

2020
01:29:55.871 --> 01:29:57.730
<v Speaker 1>They conspired to do that and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>pulled it off.</v>

2021
01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:01.720
<v Speaker 1>A bunch of people hijack planes</v>
<v Speaker 1>simultaneously in different spots in the</v>

2022
01:30:01.721 --> 01:30:03.820
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They got control of the planes,</v>

2023
01:30:03.880 --> 01:30:06.580
<v Speaker 1>flew those planes into buildings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Causal buildings collapse.</v>

2024
01:30:06.581 --> 01:30:08.470
<v Speaker 1>Thousands people died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a conspiracy.</v>

2025
01:30:08.680 --> 01:30:12.520
<v Speaker 1>It was a successfully executed</v>
<v Speaker 1>conspiracy and only one of many that we</v>

2026
01:30:12.521 --> 01:30:16.450
<v Speaker 1>know of all throughout history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you automatically take the skeptic</v>

2027
01:30:16.451 --> 01:30:19.690
<v Speaker 1>point of view,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you miss out on the possibility of</v>

2028
01:30:20.470 --> 01:30:23.710
<v Speaker 1>exposing something that is a true</v>
<v Speaker 1>conspiracy because they do exist.</v>

2029
01:30:23.740 --> 01:30:25.300
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you say the skeptic point of view,</v>

2030
01:30:25.301 --> 01:30:28.120
<v Speaker 4>what do you mean how I would say the</v>
<v Speaker 4>null hypothesis,</v>

2031
01:30:28.360 --> 01:30:31.510
<v Speaker 4>the null hypothesis is that Lee Harvey</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oswald acted alone.</v>

2032
01:30:31.600 --> 01:30:36.460
<v Speaker 4>The null hypothesis is that probably</v>
<v Speaker 4>nothing remarkable happened.</v>

2033
01:30:37.920 --> 01:30:38.890
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why would you say that?</v>

2034
01:30:39.490 --> 01:30:39.851
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

2035
01:30:39.851 --> 01:30:41.410
<v Speaker 4>Remarkable things happen all the time</v>
<v Speaker 4>though.</v>

2036
01:30:41.440 --> 01:30:43.030
<v Speaker 4>Why would.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why would that be a fault?</v>

2037
01:30:43.060 --> 01:30:43.890
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're what?</v>

2038
01:30:43.890 --> 01:30:44.290
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>

2039
01:30:44.290 --> 01:30:48.760
<v Speaker 4>What I mean in that case is take the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Take the guy for a different example of</v>

2040
01:30:48.761 --> 01:30:50.440
<v Speaker 4>a shooting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Take the guy who shot all the people at</v>

2041
01:30:50.441 --> 01:30:53.800
<v Speaker 4>the movie theater.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The null hypothesis is that a guy shot</v>

2042
01:30:53.801 --> 01:30:57.940
<v Speaker 4>all the movie people in the movie</v>
<v Speaker 4>theater as was reported by everyone who</v>

2043
01:30:57.941 --> 01:30:58.790
<v Speaker 4>was there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2044
01:30:58.870 --> 01:31:03.580
<v Speaker 4>The null hypothesis and the Kennedy</v>
<v Speaker 4>situation would be that Lee Harvey</v>

2045
01:31:03.580 --> 01:31:08.200
<v Speaker 4>Oswald acted alone as discovered by the</v>
<v Speaker 4>cops who chased him down and tackled him</v>

2046
01:31:08.201 --> 01:31:12.820
<v Speaker 4>and arrested him in the movie theater.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The null hypothesis for nine slash 11</v>

2047
01:31:12.821 --> 01:31:17.350
<v Speaker 4>would be that what happened generally as</v>
<v Speaker 4>well as we saw it on television and was</v>

2048
01:31:17.351 --> 01:31:19.360
<v Speaker 4>reported by the people where there is</v>
<v Speaker 4>what happened.</v>

2049
01:31:19.420 --> 01:31:23.200
<v Speaker 4>That's that would be the null hypothesis</v>
<v Speaker 4>and anything remarkable would be</v>

2050
01:31:23.201 --> 01:31:26.980
<v Speaker 4>something that goes against what appears</v>
<v Speaker 4>to have happened on that day.</v>

2051
01:31:28.030 --> 01:31:32.830
<v Speaker 4>So I would say that the null hypothesis</v>
<v Speaker 4>is going to generally be right most of</v>

2052
01:31:32.831 --> 01:31:36.220
<v Speaker 4>the time until we've got some remarkable</v>
<v Speaker 4>evidence to prove it wrong.</v>

2053
01:31:36.500 --> 01:31:36.680
<v Speaker 4>How do</v>

2054
01:31:36.680 --> 01:31:41.450
<v Speaker 1>you factor in contradictory evidence</v>
<v Speaker 1>from reputable online news sources?</v>

2055
01:31:41.540 --> 01:31:43.400
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like for example,</v>

2056
01:31:43.550 --> 01:31:44.410
<v Speaker 1>like let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2057
01:31:44.930 --> 01:31:48.350
<v Speaker 1>the NSA.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's perfect example before it was</v>

2058
01:31:48.351 --> 01:31:52.130
<v Speaker 1>revealed by Edward Snowden that the NSA</v>
<v Speaker 1>was indeed spying on all these different</v>

2059
01:31:52.131 --> 01:31:55.580
<v Speaker 1>Americans and detailing records of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>phone calls.</v>

2060
01:31:55.581 --> 01:31:58.370
<v Speaker 1>And who was surprised by that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very few people were,</v>

2061
01:31:58.371 --> 01:32:00.220
<v Speaker 1>but the people were had argued</v>

2062
01:32:00.220 --> 01:32:03.760
<v Speaker 2>against it via millie and they had said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no way there would be such a</v>

2063
01:32:03.761 --> 01:32:06.580
<v Speaker 2>huge conspiracy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd have to hide that from so many</v>

2064
01:32:06.581 --> 01:32:08.830
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So many people would be in the know.</v>

2065
01:32:08.831 --> 01:32:10.600
<v Speaker 2>There's no way that that could be</v>
<v Speaker 2>possibly true.</v>

2066
01:32:10.601 --> 01:32:11.800
<v Speaker 2>I heard that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>

2067
01:32:12.040 --> 01:32:16.960
<v Speaker 2>I witnessed Alex Jones having that</v>
<v Speaker 2>discussion with a person where Alex</v>

2068
01:32:16.960 --> 01:32:19.990
<v Speaker 2>Jones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who predicted this shit a long time ago,</v>

2069
01:32:19.991 --> 01:32:22.510
<v Speaker 2>almost a decade before it actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>happened,</v>

2070
01:32:22.540 --> 01:32:26.320
<v Speaker 2>I believe it was 2003 or four.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alex Jones was saying,</v>

2071
01:32:26.321 --> 01:32:29.710
<v Speaker 2>if you don't think they're keeping</v>
<v Speaker 2>detailed records of every phone call,</v>

2072
01:32:29.711 --> 01:32:32.710
<v Speaker 2>you make everything you do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every email you send.</v>

2073
01:32:33.040 --> 01:32:36.970
<v Speaker 2>He was on it way before and I thought it</v>
<v Speaker 2>was crazy nutty conspiracy talk.</v>

2074
01:32:37.330 --> 01:32:38.163
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was right.</v>

2075
01:32:38.260 --> 01:32:39.490
<v Speaker 2>They really were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They really,</v>

2076
01:32:39.540 --> 01:32:42.790
<v Speaker 2>really figured out how to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They developed this technology.</v>

2077
01:32:42.791 --> 01:32:45.520
<v Speaker 2>They created this storage facility that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're in the middle of the building</v>

2078
01:32:45.521 --> 01:32:46.840
<v Speaker 2>right now in Utah.</v>

2079
01:32:47.060 --> 01:32:49.960
<v Speaker 2>That's going to be this massive</v>
<v Speaker 2>warehouse of data and information.</v>

2080
01:32:49.961 --> 01:32:51.970
<v Speaker 2>That's a real conspiracy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That turned out to be true.</v>

2081
01:32:52.060 --> 01:32:54.160
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that there was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2082
01:32:54.170 --> 01:32:55.610
<v Speaker 2>I can't say that Alex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

2083
01:32:55.611 --> 01:32:57.430
<v Speaker 2>I don't give him credit for predicting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How dare you.</v>

2084
01:32:57.460 --> 01:33:01.540
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing that snowden revealed</v>

2085
01:33:01.720 --> 01:33:04.960
<v Speaker 2>that I don't think was pretty much</v>
<v Speaker 2>generally suspected.</v>

2086
01:33:04.961 --> 01:33:07.180
<v Speaker 2>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know that cell phone companies have</v>

2087
01:33:07.181 --> 01:33:10.180
<v Speaker 2>always had all your cell phone records.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Therefore the government has them.</v>

2088
01:33:10.570 --> 01:33:12.000
<v Speaker 2>That's not surprising to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2089
01:33:12.001 --> 01:33:14.530
<v Speaker 2>they could access that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Surprising that someone would be</v>

2090
01:33:14.531 --> 01:33:16.330
<v Speaker 2>surprised by that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>

2091
01:33:16.331 --> 01:33:20.320
<v Speaker 2>That's funny because I thought it was a</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty big revelation cause for alarm.</v>

2092
01:33:20.321 --> 01:33:22.060
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people were up in arms about</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2093
01:33:22.061 --> 01:33:24.800
<v Speaker 2>It was a pretty big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they have.</v>

2094
01:33:24.880 --> 01:33:26.830
<v Speaker 2>I think people have always been up in</v>
<v Speaker 2>arms about it.</v>

2095
01:33:27.280 --> 01:33:28.930
<v Speaker 2>There's been a lot of people saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

2096
01:33:28.931 --> 01:33:32.290
<v Speaker 2>the self privacy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the cell phone company shouldn't have</v>

2097
01:33:32.291 --> 01:33:34.380
<v Speaker 2>any way to track my calls or or to do.</v>

2098
01:33:34.600 --> 01:33:38.170
<v Speaker 2>But they can and they own their cell</v>
<v Speaker 2>phone company so they can do whatever</v>

2099
01:33:38.171 --> 01:33:40.870
<v Speaker 2>the heck they want and as long as those</v>
<v Speaker 2>records exist,</v>

2100
01:33:40.930 --> 01:33:43.420
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty naive to believe that nobody</v>
<v Speaker 2>has access to them.</v>

2101
01:33:43.460 --> 01:33:44.293
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

2102
01:33:44.310 --> 01:33:46.870
<v Speaker 2>That is not the issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The issue is that they're doing it for</v>

2103
01:33:46.871 --> 01:33:50.560
<v Speaker 2>every single American all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They constantly following you and</v>

2104
01:33:50.561 --> 01:33:54.040
<v Speaker 2>constantly watching your emails and</v>
<v Speaker 2>constantly that it's not a matter of</v>

2105
01:33:54.070 --> 01:33:56.620
<v Speaker 2>looking at suspicious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>suspicious people or people that have</v>

2106
01:33:56.621 --> 01:33:58.780
<v Speaker 2>been accused of crimes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a matter of people that are just</v>

2107
01:33:58.810 --> 01:34:01.450
<v Speaker 2>law abiding citizens that are taxpayers</v>
<v Speaker 2>and doing nothing wrong,</v>

2108
01:34:01.451 --> 01:34:05.980
<v Speaker 2>but yet they're being almost like held</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're checking all their</v>

2109
01:34:05.981 --> 01:34:08.320
<v Speaker 2>information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like this thing that they hold over</v>

2110
01:34:08.321 --> 01:34:11.800
<v Speaker 2>your head and the idea that this could</v>
<v Speaker 2>be used to intimidate political</v>

2111
01:34:11.801 --> 01:34:15.580
<v Speaker 2>opponents so this could be used to</v>
<v Speaker 2>intimidate business rivals.</v>

2112
01:34:15.770 --> 01:34:18.070
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that was a huge conspiracy and I</v>

2113
01:34:18.071 --> 01:34:20.650
<v Speaker 2>think to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to deny that that was pretty shocking to</v>

2114
01:34:20.651 --> 01:34:24.490
<v Speaker 2>the American people when we found out</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they not only did indeed have this</v>

2115
01:34:24.491 --> 01:34:27.610
<v Speaker 2>power and capability,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they had been utilizing it for a</v>

2116
01:34:27.611 --> 01:34:30.790
<v Speaker 2>long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some things only shocking if you didn't</v>

2117
01:34:30.791 --> 01:34:34.390
<v Speaker 2>have enough information to be aware of</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that was going on.</v>

2118
01:34:34.770 --> 01:34:36.430
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

2119
01:34:36.540 --> 01:34:40.960
<v Speaker 2>I mean I come from the Silicon Valley</v>
<v Speaker 2>background and</v>

2120
01:34:44.560 --> 01:34:47.740
<v Speaker 2>with the formation of all the big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the big search engines and things like</v>

2121
01:34:47.741 --> 01:34:51.250
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>having worked at enormous ridiculously</v>

2122
01:34:51.251 --> 01:34:54.970
<v Speaker 2>huge data centers and everything and</v>
<v Speaker 2>having a general idea of how the</v>

2123
01:34:54.971 --> 01:34:56.800
<v Speaker 2>technology works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>

2124
01:34:57.290 --> 01:35:00.530
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's to me it's nothing,</v>

2125
01:35:00.531 --> 01:35:02.540
<v Speaker 2>nothing in that is surprising that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2126
01:35:02.950 --> 01:35:06.320
<v Speaker 2>that data is being collected on that</v>
<v Speaker 2>large of a scale or that anyone would</v>

2127
01:35:06.321 --> 01:35:08.600
<v Speaker 2>have access to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing.</v>

2128
01:35:08.660 --> 01:35:12.350
<v Speaker 2>Nothing I've heard coming from snowden</v>
<v Speaker 2>surprised me in any way and wouldn't</v>

2129
01:35:12.351 --> 01:35:15.080
<v Speaker 2>surprise most of the people from a</v>
<v Speaker 2>similar background as me I think.</v>

2130
01:35:15.830 --> 01:35:17.540
<v Speaker 2>I think for a lot of people is quite</v>
<v Speaker 2>shocking.</v>

2131
01:35:17.750 --> 01:35:19.250
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

2132
01:35:19.251 --> 01:35:21.170
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think if you,</v>

2133
01:35:21.171 --> 01:35:23.700
<v Speaker 2>if you know anything about the way the</v>
<v Speaker 2>technology works and about that,</v>

2134
01:35:23.720 --> 01:35:26.270
<v Speaker 2>the whole data storage and collection</v>
<v Speaker 2>industry,</v>

2135
01:35:26.480 --> 01:35:29.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the null hypothesis has got to be that</v>

2136
01:35:29.780 --> 01:35:32.300
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyone who wants access to it has access</v>

2137
01:35:32.301 --> 01:35:37.301
<v Speaker 2>to but in wasn't the no hypothesis when</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obama gave that speech and said that</v>

2138
01:35:37.671 --> 01:35:39.740
<v Speaker 2>we're not doing it and this is just</v>
<v Speaker 2>metadata.</v>

2139
01:35:39.741 --> 01:35:43.220
<v Speaker 2>And when didn't believe people believe</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it wasn't that essentially what</v>

2140
01:35:43.221 --> 01:35:45.320
<v Speaker 2>everyone was reporting in the news and</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone was saying,</v>

2141
01:35:45.321 --> 01:35:47.450
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is much ado about nothing.</v>

2142
01:35:47.451 --> 01:35:48.740
<v Speaker 2>This is just metadata.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't worry.</v>

2143
01:35:48.741 --> 01:35:50.660
<v Speaker 2>And then it turned out that that wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>the case at all.</v>

2144
01:35:51.050 --> 01:35:53.180
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the null hypothesis also,</v>

2145
01:35:53.210 --> 01:35:57.350
<v Speaker 2>I think that the government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the government maybe,</v>

2146
01:35:57.470 --> 01:35:58.130
<v Speaker 2>maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2147
01:35:58.130 --> 01:36:03.100
<v Speaker 2>maybe a presidential press releases are</v>
<v Speaker 2>not always exactly accurate to a federal</v>

2148
01:36:03.190 --> 01:36:03.830
<v Speaker 2>truth.</v>

2149
01:36:03.830 --> 01:36:06.260
<v Speaker 2>How do we apply that to everything else?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do we apply that to the Kennedy</v>

2150
01:36:06.261 --> 01:36:08.930
<v Speaker 2>assassination?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And how mean the nutters hear this and</v>

2151
01:36:08.931 --> 01:36:10.340
<v Speaker 2>they're going to apply it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry for calling.</v>

2152
01:36:10.341 --> 01:36:12.280
<v Speaker 2>You notice folks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the nine slash 11 truther,</v>

2153
01:36:12.380 --> 01:36:14.510
<v Speaker 2>how about that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There they apply that to nine slash 11.</v>

2154
01:36:14.511 --> 01:36:17.030
<v Speaker 2>Truth there say this is you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>contradicting yourself.</v>

2155
01:36:18.980 --> 01:36:21.200
<v Speaker 2>The whole idea that what they're saying</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

2156
01:36:22.640 --> 01:36:27.320
<v Speaker 2>is not the null hypothesis or what do</v>
<v Speaker 2>you mean will you said that the</v>

2157
01:36:27.321 --> 01:36:30.170
<v Speaker 2>government tends to be a liar when it</v>
<v Speaker 2>comes to press conferences.</v>

2158
01:36:30.320 --> 01:36:30.741
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

2159
01:36:30.741 --> 01:36:31.574
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got you.</v>

2160
01:36:31.610 --> 01:36:36.500
<v Speaker 2>And an official story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The official story is is a lie because</v>

2161
01:36:36.501 --> 01:36:39.920
<v Speaker 2>it's the official story because it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>coming from the government compared to</v>

2162
01:36:39.980 --> 01:36:43.550
<v Speaker 2>the null hypothesis being that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>government always lies about everything</v>

2163
01:36:43.730 --> 01:36:46.640
<v Speaker 2>or a frequently is not completely</v>
<v Speaker 2>truthful.</v>

2164
01:36:46.790 --> 01:36:47.061
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2165
01:36:47.061 --> 01:36:51.230
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't a no hypothesis that the story</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's being produced in the media is</v>

2166
01:36:51.231 --> 01:36:53.420
<v Speaker 2>the actual story that whatever the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2167
01:36:53.421 --> 01:36:58.010
<v Speaker 2>the conclusions that mainstream is</v>
<v Speaker 2>accepted about Osama bin Ladin and these</v>

2168
01:36:58.011 --> 01:37:01.640
<v Speaker 2>hijackers from Saudi Arabia and all</v>
<v Speaker 2>these different things that factor into</v>

2169
01:37:01.641 --> 01:37:05.930
<v Speaker 2>the events of nine slash 11 are in fact</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly how it went down when you in</v>

2170
01:37:05.931 --> 01:37:09.380
<v Speaker 2>fact just said that when it comes to</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the NSA and the Obama</v>

2171
01:37:09.381 --> 01:37:13.670
<v Speaker 2>administration not being correct or</v>
<v Speaker 2>being truthful about metadata and what</v>

2172
01:37:13.671 --> 01:37:16.550
<v Speaker 2>was being collected that well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the United States government tends to</v>

2173
01:37:16.551 --> 01:37:17.030
<v Speaker 2>lie well.</v>

2174
01:37:17.030 --> 01:37:19.520
<v Speaker 2>If they tend to lie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they tend to lie and if they tend to</v>

2175
01:37:19.521 --> 01:37:20.990
<v Speaker 2>lie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why would you assume that there are</v>

2176
01:37:20.991 --> 01:37:24.170
<v Speaker 2>other explanations for all the different</v>
<v Speaker 2>things that have taken place for true at</v>

2177
01:37:24.171 --> 01:37:25.670
<v Speaker 2>all?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wouldn't be the happy.</v>

2178
01:37:25.690 --> 01:37:29.150
<v Speaker 2>It's just fascinating subject and</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously very complicated,</v>

2179
01:37:29.290 --> 01:37:32.240
<v Speaker 2>but that's my point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the point.</v>

2180
01:37:32.241 --> 01:37:32.780
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

2181
01:37:32.780 --> 01:37:35.900
<v Speaker 2>but also when you say the official</v>
<v Speaker 2>story,</v>

2182
01:37:35.901 --> 01:37:38.060
<v Speaker 2>when you're talking about what the</v>
<v Speaker 2>government says,</v>

2183
01:37:38.780 --> 01:37:43.640
<v Speaker 2>that's not necessarily the source of</v>
<v Speaker 2>information that people are relying on.</v>

2184
01:37:44.180 --> 01:37:46.580
<v Speaker 2>Nobody has read the nine slash 11</v>
<v Speaker 2>report.</v>

2185
01:37:46.610 --> 01:37:48.680
<v Speaker 2>Nobody has read the Warren Commission</v>
<v Speaker 2>report.</v>

2186
01:37:49.100 --> 01:37:50.750
<v Speaker 2>You and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't even know what the government's</v>

2187
01:37:50.751 --> 01:37:52.760
<v Speaker 2>position is on those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We assume we do.</v>

2188
01:37:53.090 --> 01:37:54.980
<v Speaker 2>We assume that it's whatever's in those</v>
<v Speaker 2>reports,</v>

2189
01:37:55.110 --> 01:37:56.130
<v Speaker 2>what people generally</v>

2190
01:37:56.130 --> 01:37:58.140
<v Speaker 4>believe about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's not our source of</v>

2191
01:37:58.141 --> 01:38:00.090
<v Speaker 4>information.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We didn't go to the government for our</v>

2192
01:38:00.091 --> 01:38:01.770
<v Speaker 4>information.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've.</v>

2193
01:38:01.860 --> 01:38:06.840
<v Speaker 4>I don't think I've ever had a question</v>
<v Speaker 4>about nine slash 11 that I've gone and</v>

2194
01:38:06.841 --> 01:38:09.300
<v Speaker 4>googled a government website to find out</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the,</v>

2195
01:38:10.070 --> 01:38:11.370
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what should have happened,</v>

2196
01:38:11.371 --> 01:38:12.060
<v Speaker 4>what I'm supposed to be</v>

2197
01:38:12.060 --> 01:38:12.930
<v Speaker 1>belief is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think anything.</v>

2198
01:38:12.940 --> 01:38:14.760
<v Speaker 1>There are government websites and spell</v>
<v Speaker 1>out history.</v>

2199
01:38:15.380 --> 01:38:17.160
<v Speaker 1>Is there a government website?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's history.</v>

2200
01:38:17.161 --> 01:38:18.660
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that exists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no.</v>

2201
01:38:18.661 --> 01:38:19.950
<v Speaker 1>It fucking crushed that thing.</v>

2202
01:38:20.270 --> 01:38:23.900
<v Speaker 4>The thing is you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't conflate the government's</v>

2203
01:38:23.930 --> 01:38:26.930
<v Speaker 4>version of events with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why I like to use the term,</v>

2204
01:38:26.940 --> 01:38:29.120
<v Speaker 4>the standard model.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The standard model is what,</v>

2205
01:38:29.510 --> 01:38:31.730
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>probably most historians,</v>

2206
01:38:32.040 --> 01:38:33.080
<v Speaker 4>p,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever,</v>

2207
01:38:33.110 --> 01:38:35.330
<v Speaker 4>whatever the field is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever the scientists are,</v>

2208
01:38:35.331 --> 01:38:37.700
<v Speaker 4>whatever the historians are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if it's a historical weather,</v>

2209
01:38:37.720 --> 01:38:39.200
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what most lawyers think,</v>

2210
01:38:39.201 --> 01:38:40.330
<v Speaker 4>if it's a legal question,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

2211
01:38:40.520 --> 01:38:43.340
<v Speaker 4>I would call it the standard model.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would not use the term of the official</v>

2212
01:38:43.341 --> 01:38:45.920
<v Speaker 4>story because that suggests government</v>
<v Speaker 4>involvement,</v>

2213
01:38:45.921 --> 01:38:49.670
<v Speaker 4>which is not not an authoritative</v>
<v Speaker 4>source.</v>

2214
01:38:50.210 --> 01:38:51.410
<v Speaker 4>The government,</v>
<v Speaker 4>quote unquote,</v>

2215
01:38:51.411 --> 01:38:53.840
<v Speaker 4>is not an authoritative source on</v>
<v Speaker 4>anything.</v>

2216
01:38:54.590 --> 01:38:56.630
<v Speaker 4>It's not where people get their nine</v>
<v Speaker 4>slash 11 information.</v>

2217
01:38:56.631 --> 01:38:59.540
<v Speaker 4>We get that from basically from</v>
<v Speaker 4>historians,</v>

2218
01:38:59.900 --> 01:39:00.400
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for,</v>

2219
01:39:00.400 --> 01:39:04.490
<v Speaker 4>from modern history.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not the official source on how many</v>

2220
01:39:04.520 --> 01:39:06.500
<v Speaker 4>neutrons are in a boron,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Adam,</v>

2221
01:39:06.530 --> 01:39:07.510
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

2222
01:39:07.530 --> 01:39:09.590
<v Speaker 4>we get that from the standard model of</v>
<v Speaker 4>science.</v>

2223
01:39:10.340 --> 01:39:11.440
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2224
01:39:12.030 --> 01:39:14.420
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it's too much of a,</v>

2225
01:39:15.290 --> 01:39:19.370
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it's hypocritical for me</v>
<v Speaker 4>to say that I'm a boy.</v>

2226
01:39:19.371 --> 01:39:22.760
<v Speaker 4>I'm twisting myself into knots here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it's hypocritical for me</v>

2227
01:39:22.761 --> 01:39:26.690
<v Speaker 4>to say that when Obama says something</v>
<v Speaker 4>that we shouldn't accept as the truth,</v>

2228
01:39:27.530 --> 01:39:29.060
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

2229
01:39:29.061 --> 01:39:34.061
<v Speaker 4>that conflicts with the government's</v>
<v Speaker 4>official position on nine slash 11 or</v>

2230
01:39:34.341 --> 01:39:36.500
<v Speaker 4>snowden or what the end of the Kennedy</v>
<v Speaker 4>assassination.</v>

2231
01:39:37.670 --> 01:39:39.260
<v Speaker 4>I think what I'm saying makes sense.</v>

2232
01:39:39.380 --> 01:39:39.750
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2233
01:39:39.750 --> 01:39:42.170
<v Speaker 1>the issue with that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course the news outlets,</v>

2234
01:39:42.230 --> 01:39:45.080
<v Speaker 1>especially in the Kennedy assassination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got all their information from the</v>

2235
01:39:45.081 --> 01:39:47.810
<v Speaker 1>government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They got all the reports from</v>

2236
01:39:48.140 --> 01:39:53.140
<v Speaker 1>spokespersons that were assigned this</v>
<v Speaker 1>position to give this press conference</v>

2237
01:39:53.241 --> 01:39:56.200
<v Speaker 1>and explained what the details are where</v>
<v Speaker 1>the president was found.</v>

2238
01:39:56.210 --> 01:39:57.110
<v Speaker 1>Bethesda,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maryland.</v>

2239
01:39:57.350 --> 01:39:59.030
<v Speaker 1>What do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy got his talking points as he</v>

2240
01:39:59.031 --> 01:39:59.950
<v Speaker 1>winging it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2241
01:39:59.951 --> 01:40:02.240
<v Speaker 1>they're not winging it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those guys were told what to say and</v>

2242
01:40:02.241 --> 01:40:04.220
<v Speaker 1>when to say it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they were put on television because</v>

2243
01:40:04.221 --> 01:40:06.330
<v Speaker 1>it was an easily controlled thing back</v>
<v Speaker 1>then there.</v>

2244
01:40:06.760 --> 01:40:08.510
<v Speaker 1>The reporters on the site.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

2245
01:40:08.511 --> 01:40:10.970
<v Speaker 1>But what do they know whether they know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they know the president was dead and</v>

2246
01:40:10.971 --> 01:40:12.150
<v Speaker 1>then they took the president's body</v>
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>

2247
01:40:12.151 --> 01:40:14.120
<v Speaker 1>Everything else is information from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>government.</v>

2248
01:40:14.620 --> 01:40:15.191
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2249
01:40:15.191 --> 01:40:17.770
<v Speaker 4>what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Were they handed a press release that</v>

2250
01:40:17.771 --> 01:40:20.830
<v Speaker 4>says White House at the top and Said</v>
<v Speaker 4>told report this?</v>

2251
01:40:20.920 --> 01:40:22.090
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it depends on where were they getting</v>

2252
01:40:22.091 --> 01:40:22.920
<v Speaker 4>their information.</v>

2253
01:40:22.920 --> 01:40:24.510
<v Speaker 1>Depends on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's many,</v>

2254
01:40:24.511 --> 01:40:25.111
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>

2255
01:40:25.111 --> 01:40:26.080
<v Speaker 1>many outlets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

2256
01:40:26.350 --> 01:40:27.480
<v Speaker 1>there's different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2257
01:40:27.520 --> 01:40:29.670
<v Speaker 1>doctors had talked about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's different people who were on the</v>

2258
01:40:29.671 --> 01:40:32.730
<v Speaker 1>news.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's Tom who is the guy who explained</v>

2259
01:40:32.731 --> 01:40:35.850
<v Speaker 1>it on television for the first time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that classic speech that the president</v>

2260
01:40:35.851 --> 01:40:38.300
<v Speaker 1>has been shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Goddammit.</v>

2261
01:40:38.430 --> 01:40:41.580
<v Speaker 1>Who was it that famous Daniel Grant?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe it was Dan Rather.</v>

2262
01:40:41.581 --> 01:40:43.350
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe it was before his time.</v>

2263
01:40:43.920 --> 01:40:45.440
<v Speaker 1>I want to say it doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2264
01:40:45.590 --> 01:40:48.240
<v Speaker 1>It's pointless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The point is that where are they getting</v>

2265
01:40:48.241 --> 01:40:49.074
<v Speaker 1>that information?</v>

2266
01:40:49.160 --> 01:40:51.560
<v Speaker 4>I'm asking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't see how the government fits in</v>

2267
01:40:51.561 --> 01:40:53.860
<v Speaker 4>that loop.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Will the government had body and they</v>

2268
01:40:53.861 --> 01:40:54.220
<v Speaker 4>released</v>

2269
01:40:54.220 --> 01:40:55.630
<v Speaker 1>a press statement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fact.</v>

2270
01:40:55.900 --> 01:40:57.700
<v Speaker 1>I mean they tell people that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>president has been shot.</v>

2271
01:40:57.701 --> 01:41:00.300
<v Speaker 1>The president's dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what's going on and you know</v>

2272
01:41:00.310 --> 01:41:03.490
<v Speaker 1>when the news outlets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's local or national,</v>

2273
01:41:03.700 --> 01:41:04.690
<v Speaker 1>ABC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>NBC,</v>

2274
01:41:04.691 --> 01:41:07.330
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they need to get the information from</v>

2275
01:41:07.331 --> 01:41:09.430
<v Speaker 1>the official source.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The official source would be someone</v>

2276
01:41:09.431 --> 01:41:12.610
<v Speaker 1>who's in the government that has a press</v>
<v Speaker 1>conference that explains the events as</v>

2277
01:41:12.611 --> 01:41:13.444
<v Speaker 1>they took place.</v>

2278
01:41:14.200 --> 01:41:15.033
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

2279
01:41:15.720 --> 01:41:18.090
<v Speaker 1>what kind of spinning around in circles</v>
<v Speaker 1>here that might be annoying for people?</v>

2280
01:41:19.450 --> 01:41:20.220
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2281
01:41:20.220 --> 01:41:22.430
<v Speaker 1>I was basically going to circle where I</v>
<v Speaker 1>would say the same thing.</v>

2282
01:41:23.130 --> 01:41:27.270
<v Speaker 1>We agree on more than we disagree on and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that what I'm trying to say is</v>

2283
01:41:27.271 --> 01:41:31.620
<v Speaker 1>that there's weirdness to the world and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that to automatically take the skeptical</v>

2284
01:41:31.621 --> 01:41:35.700
<v Speaker 1>position is oftentimes just as silly as</v>
<v Speaker 1>automatically taking the conspiratorial</v>

2285
01:41:35.940 --> 01:41:36.571
<v Speaker 1>position.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2286
01:41:36.571 --> 01:41:37.100
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean</v>

2287
01:41:37.100 --> 01:41:39.410
<v Speaker 4>by the skeptical position?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do you mean when you say,</v>

2288
01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:41.040
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>from,</v>

2289
01:41:41.210 --> 01:41:42.290
<v Speaker 4>from,</v>
<v Speaker 4>from you that I'm,</v>

2290
01:41:42.291 --> 01:41:45.440
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm getting the message that you think I</v>

2291
01:41:45.441 --> 01:41:46.850
<v Speaker 4>tend to take a silly position.</v>

2292
01:41:46.990 --> 01:41:47.680
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2293
01:41:47.680 --> 01:41:51.430
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Skeptical that it is silly to take this.</v>

2294
01:41:51.431 --> 01:41:54.460
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to be fooled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Position just as foolish as it is</v>

2295
01:41:54.461 --> 01:41:59.461
<v Speaker 1>sometimes to take this blue double</v>
<v Speaker 1>double that either when Phil crazy,</v>

2296
01:41:59.950 --> 01:42:02.470
<v Speaker 1>just as silly as it is to automatically</v>
<v Speaker 1>knee jerk,</v>

2297
01:42:02.471 --> 01:42:05.590
<v Speaker 1>take the conspiratorial position when we</v>
<v Speaker 1>know for a fact that certain</v>

2298
01:42:05.591 --> 01:42:07.990
<v Speaker 1>conspiracies have not just been planned</v>
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>

2299
01:42:07.991 --> 01:42:10.090
<v Speaker 1>but had been executed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's the Gulf of Tonkin that led</v>

2300
01:42:10.091 --> 01:42:12.220
<v Speaker 1>us into Vietnam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's operation northwoods,</v>

2301
01:42:12.221 --> 01:42:16.870
<v Speaker 1>which was a planned attack on American</v>
<v Speaker 1>civilians and American military that was</v>

2302
01:42:16.871 --> 01:42:21.070
<v Speaker 1>signed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were going to make a jetliner</v>

2303
01:42:21.071 --> 01:42:23.410
<v Speaker 1>explode.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were going to arm Cuban friendlies</v>

2304
01:42:23.411 --> 01:42:28.411
<v Speaker 1>and have them attack Guantanamo Bay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of this to blame on the Cubans so</v>

2305
01:42:28.451 --> 01:42:31.210
<v Speaker 1>that we could go to war with Cuba when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that that kind of information</v>

2306
01:42:31.211 --> 01:42:34.720
<v Speaker 1>exists and was real and it's provable</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's in the freedom of Information</v>

2307
01:42:34.720 --> 01:42:36.610
<v Speaker 1>Act releases when you know about all</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

2308
01:42:37.090 --> 01:42:38.830
<v Speaker 1>that has to be factored into the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2309
01:42:38.870 --> 01:42:40.710
<v Speaker 1>the spectrum of possibilities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

2310
01:42:40.720 --> 01:42:41.800
<v Speaker 1>But you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't</v>

2311
01:42:41.910 --> 01:42:45.840
<v Speaker 4>use the fact that there have been real</v>
<v Speaker 4>conspiracies and history.</v>

2312
01:42:46.050 --> 01:42:51.050
<v Speaker 4>You can't use that to defend conspiracy</v>
<v Speaker 4>theories because conspiracy theories as</v>

2313
01:42:52.501 --> 01:42:54.450
<v Speaker 4>defined by the way you and I are</v>
<v Speaker 4>discussing them,</v>

2314
01:42:54.870 --> 01:42:59.190
<v Speaker 4>our future predictions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that conspiracy theory about nine slash</v>

2315
01:42:59.191 --> 01:43:01.470
<v Speaker 4>11 and having been an inside job,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>

2316
01:43:01.740 --> 01:43:05.640
<v Speaker 4>predict that one day it will be</v>
<v Speaker 4>discovered that the government</v>

2317
01:43:05.850 --> 01:43:07.590
<v Speaker 4>orchestrated nine slash 11.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's A.</v>

2318
01:43:07.620 --> 01:43:12.420
<v Speaker 4>It's a prediction of evidence that will</v>
<v Speaker 4>someday have exist in the future and</v>

2319
01:43:12.421 --> 01:43:14.880
<v Speaker 4>future predictions really have never</v>
<v Speaker 4>come true.</v>

2320
01:43:14.890 --> 01:43:15.720
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2321
01:43:15.720 --> 01:43:18.540
<v Speaker 4>I say that there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've said this in print many times,</v>

2322
01:43:18.600 --> 01:43:23.280
<v Speaker 4>that there are no conspiracy theories</v>
<v Speaker 4>that have ever come true.</v>

2323
01:43:24.200 --> 01:43:29.070
<v Speaker 4>A conspiracy theory being something that</v>
<v Speaker 4>has existed as a theory among conspiracy</v>

2324
01:43:29.071 --> 01:43:31.620
<v Speaker 4>theorists unknown to the general public</v>
<v Speaker 4>unknown.</v>

2325
01:43:31.870 --> 01:43:32.910
<v Speaker 4>I'll dispute that right away.</v>

2326
01:43:33.250 --> 01:43:35.430
<v Speaker 1>That one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about the LSD experiments that they</v>

2327
01:43:35.431 --> 01:43:36.264
<v Speaker 1>did on civilians?</v>

2328
01:43:36.750 --> 01:43:38.970
<v Speaker 4>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that did not exist as a conspiracy</v>

2329
01:43:38.971 --> 01:43:40.320
<v Speaker 4>theory until it was discovered.</v>

2330
01:43:40.410 --> 01:43:41.380
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most certainly did it.</v>

2331
01:43:41.381 --> 01:43:45.860
<v Speaker 1>It just existed in my high school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We talked about them doing lsd</v>

2332
01:43:45.861 --> 01:43:48.050
<v Speaker 1>experiments on soldiers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was an urban legend.</v>

2333
01:43:48.080 --> 01:43:50.870
<v Speaker 1>It was a myth that they gave soldiers</v>
<v Speaker 1>lsd and they,</v>

2334
01:43:50.871 --> 01:43:51.980
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they drag</v>

2335
01:43:51.980 --> 01:43:54.950
<v Speaker 2>people to find out what the asset would</v>
<v Speaker 2>do to them and it rotted their brain</v>

2336
01:43:54.951 --> 01:43:56.150
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'd hear all these stories.</v>

2337
01:43:56.520 --> 01:43:58.490
<v Speaker 2>You could hear about it from people that</v>
<v Speaker 2>were in the military.</v>

2338
01:43:58.491 --> 01:44:01.010
<v Speaker 2>You're talking about Mk ultra.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not talking about Mk ultra.</v>

2339
01:44:01.011 --> 01:44:06.011
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about operation midnight</v>
<v Speaker 2>climax where the CIA drugged up people</v>

2340
01:44:06.351 --> 01:44:10.340
<v Speaker 2>that were in brothels in New York and</v>
<v Speaker 2>San Francisco so that they can study the</v>

2341
01:44:10.341 --> 01:44:14.210
<v Speaker 2>effects of Lsd on innocent civilians.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about here.</v>

2342
01:44:14.240 --> 01:44:16.970
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think that was part of Mk ultra</v>

2343
01:44:17.460 --> 01:44:18.100
<v Speaker 2>mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was,</v>

2344
01:44:18.100 --> 01:44:19.550
<v Speaker 2>there was a lot of programs related to</v>
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

2345
01:44:20.330 --> 01:44:22.010
<v Speaker 2>Basically the same operation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>midnight,</v>

2346
01:44:22.011 --> 01:44:23.750
<v Speaker 2>19 fifties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>forties,</v>

2347
01:44:25.140 --> 01:44:26.030
<v Speaker 2>fifties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty early.</v>

2348
01:44:26.090 --> 01:44:27.220
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was also the,</v>

2349
01:44:27.221 --> 01:44:29.270
<v Speaker 2>the various things that they did to</v>
<v Speaker 2>soldiers.</v>

2350
01:44:29.300 --> 01:44:33.050
<v Speaker 2>Many of them documented to this day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were all legends at one point in</v>

2351
01:44:33.051 --> 01:44:33.910
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those were all the,</v>

2352
01:44:33.940 --> 01:44:37.090
<v Speaker 2>the mind control experiments that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>did to Timothy.</v>

2353
01:44:37.110 --> 01:44:38.360
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's his name?</v>

2354
01:44:38.361 --> 01:44:39.470
<v Speaker 2>The unibomber.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's his name?</v>

2355
01:44:40.370 --> 01:44:42.290
<v Speaker 2>Tim [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ted Kaczynski.</v>

2356
01:44:42.320 --> 01:44:44.760
<v Speaker 2>Ted Kaczynski.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was a part of the,</v>

2357
01:44:44.761 --> 01:44:45.594
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2358
01:44:45.600 --> 01:44:47.240
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Harvard Lsd Studies,</v>

2359
01:44:47.690 --> 01:44:49.880
<v Speaker 2>Ted Kaczynski.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They fucking does that guy have with</v>

2360
01:44:49.890 --> 01:44:51.320
<v Speaker 2>acid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know that as.</v>

2361
01:44:51.330 --> 01:44:53.870
<v Speaker 2>He was very cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a documentary on it,</v>

2362
01:44:54.670 --> 01:44:59.390
<v Speaker 2>I think it was called the net and it was</v>
<v Speaker 2>all about tracing back the roots of his</v>

2363
01:44:59.391 --> 01:45:03.170
<v Speaker 2>insanity to these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these lsd experiments and that he may</v>

2364
01:45:03.200 --> 01:45:06.500
<v Speaker 2>very well have signed up for something</v>
<v Speaker 2>that fried is fucking brain.</v>

2365
01:45:06.560 --> 01:45:06.970
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me,</v>

2366
01:45:06.970 --> 01:45:08.390
<v Speaker 2>let me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me ask her something right now.</v>

2367
01:45:08.710 --> 01:45:11.000
<v Speaker 2>Ask.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to ask your listeners of whom</v>

2368
01:45:11.001 --> 01:45:15.880
<v Speaker 2>you have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many don't know what we're talking</v>

2369
01:45:15.890 --> 01:45:20.360
<v Speaker 2>about more than it definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to ask for all of all of Joe's</v>

2370
01:45:20.361 --> 01:45:23.480
<v Speaker 2>listeners out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you have an example of a conspiracy</v>

2371
01:45:23.481 --> 01:45:28.481
<v Speaker 2>theory that existed as a theory among</v>
<v Speaker 2>conspiracy theorist before it became</v>

2372
01:45:28.760 --> 01:45:32.150
<v Speaker 2>generally known by law enforcement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>media,</v>

2373
01:45:32.180 --> 01:45:32.721
<v Speaker 2>general,</v>
<v Speaker 2>public,</v>

2374
01:45:32.721 --> 01:45:33.554
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

2375
01:45:33.680 --> 01:45:35.250
<v Speaker 2>Please let me know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Email me,</v>

2376
01:45:35.251 --> 01:45:39.830
<v Speaker 2>Brian at [inaudible] dot com because I</v>
<v Speaker 2>still maintain that there are none and I</v>

2377
01:45:39.831 --> 01:45:43.040
<v Speaker 2>would love to be proven wrong about this</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what the what Alex Jones said,</v>

2378
01:45:43.041 --> 01:45:45.230
<v Speaker 2>isn't that a conspiracy theory that</v>
<v Speaker 2>turned out to be true that the</v>

2379
01:45:45.231 --> 01:45:47.930
<v Speaker 2>government is spying on your emails and</v>
<v Speaker 2>listening to all your phone.</v>

2380
01:45:47.990 --> 01:45:50.900
<v Speaker 2>That wasn't something that was known</v>
<v Speaker 2>only to conspiracy theorists.</v>

2381
01:45:50.950 --> 01:45:52.640
<v Speaker 2>That was something that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's.</v>

2382
01:45:52.970 --> 01:45:54.230
<v Speaker 2>That wasn't surprising.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2383
01:45:54.280 --> 01:45:57.620
<v Speaker 2>I can tell you because you were in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>number of the people who were in that</v>

2384
01:45:57.621 --> 01:45:58.820
<v Speaker 2>industry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't surprise me,</v>

2385
01:45:58.850 --> 01:46:02.510
<v Speaker 2>but from someone like me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was very surprising and for people</v>

2386
01:46:02.511 --> 01:46:04.820
<v Speaker 2>that were listening to the official</v>
<v Speaker 2>government story,</v>

2387
01:46:04.821 --> 01:46:06.270
<v Speaker 2>it was absolutely contradicting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

2388
01:46:06.310 --> 01:46:09.380
<v Speaker 2>and the first time you learned about</v>
<v Speaker 2>teen conspiracy theories,</v>

2389
01:46:09.381 --> 01:46:10.550
<v Speaker 2>that turned out to be true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's read.</v>

2390
01:46:10.670 --> 01:46:11.503
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2391
01:46:11.920 --> 01:46:15.320
<v Speaker 2>You're funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hear your voice is not objective,</v>

2392
01:46:15.321 --> 01:46:16.154
<v Speaker 2>sir.</v>

2393
01:46:16.730 --> 01:46:21.680
<v Speaker 2>Cancer viruses into other vaccines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Atm Machines will someday use facial</v>

2394
01:46:21.681 --> 01:46:23.750
<v Speaker 2>recognition technology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2395
01:46:23.751 --> 01:46:26.030
<v Speaker 2>but those are silly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are not conspiracy theories.</v>

2396
01:46:26.031 --> 01:46:29.030
<v Speaker 2>That's just prognosticating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is just crazy.</v>

2397
01:46:29.031 --> 01:46:29.751
<v Speaker 2>And projecting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2398
01:46:29.751 --> 01:46:32.300
<v Speaker 2>there must be something in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The US government and Monsanto are</v>

2399
01:46:32.301 --> 01:46:35.630
<v Speaker 2>teaming up against opponents of agenda,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kinetically modified food.</v>

2400
01:46:36.110 --> 01:46:41.110
<v Speaker 2>It's not a conspiracy theory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not know kind of is that the US</v>

2401
01:46:41.750 --> 01:46:45.260
<v Speaker 2>government and Monsanto are teaming up</v>
<v Speaker 2>to make money pro wrestling's fake.</v>

2402
01:46:45.440 --> 01:46:46.730
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not real.</v>

2403
01:46:47.360 --> 01:46:48.560
<v Speaker 2>Shut the fuck up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

2404
01:46:48.950 --> 01:46:50.460
<v Speaker 2>Do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't break my break.</v>

2405
01:46:50.461 --> 01:46:54.720
<v Speaker 2>My word world in half a scientists all</v>
<v Speaker 2>over the world are creating extremely</v>

2406
01:46:54.721 --> 01:46:57.060
<v Speaker 2>bizarre human animal hybrids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2407
01:46:57.061 --> 01:46:58.070
<v Speaker 2>Is this true?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not long ago,</v>

2408
01:46:58.080 --> 01:47:02.460
<v Speaker 2>Chinese scientists embedded genes for</v>
<v Speaker 2>human milk proteins into a mouse genome</v>

2409
01:47:02.461 --> 01:47:05.670
<v Speaker 2>and have since created herds of</v>
<v Speaker 2>humanized milk producing.</v>

2410
01:47:05.820 --> 01:47:06.750
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just ignorance.</v>

2411
01:47:06.780 --> 01:47:08.280
<v Speaker 2>They don't understand what what's going</v>
<v Speaker 2>on there.</v>

2412
01:47:08.280 --> 01:47:10.290
<v Speaker 2>They.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not making human hybrids.</v>

2413
01:47:10.291 --> 01:47:14.010
<v Speaker 2>They're just utilizing genes for certain</v>
<v Speaker 2>specific actions.</v>

2414
01:47:14.100 --> 01:47:16.770
<v Speaker 2>Using a cell phone could cause cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2415
01:47:16.771 --> 01:47:19.250
<v Speaker 2>That's not been proven unless you talked</v>
<v Speaker 2>to Sheryl Crow.</v>

2416
01:47:20.410 --> 01:47:23.460
<v Speaker 2>Crow thinks she got a brain tumor from</v>
<v Speaker 2>listening to the cell phone all the</v>

2417
01:47:23.461 --> 01:47:25.560
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fluoride is harmful for your teeth.</v>

2418
01:47:25.950 --> 01:47:26.880
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that true?</v>

2419
01:47:27.090 --> 01:47:30.060
<v Speaker 2>Department of Health and Human Services</v>
<v Speaker 2>and environmental protection agency are</v>

2420
01:47:30.061 --> 01:47:33.750
<v Speaker 2>proposing the change because of an</v>
<v Speaker 2>increase in fluorosis,</v>

2421
01:47:33.751 --> 01:47:37.380
<v Speaker 2>a condition that causes spotting and</v>
<v Speaker 2>streaking of children's teeth.</v>

2422
01:47:37.500 --> 01:47:40.750
<v Speaker 2>These are not conspiracy theories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a bad promotions of anti</v>

2423
01:47:40.751 --> 01:47:43.210
<v Speaker 2>science.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is stupid prescription drugs kill</v>

2424
01:47:43.211 --> 01:47:45.120
<v Speaker 2>large numbers of Americans to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking.</v>

2425
01:47:45.121 --> 01:47:46.770
<v Speaker 2>Everything kills people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if somebody,</v>

2426
01:47:46.771 --> 01:47:50.400
<v Speaker 2>if someone out there does have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>conspiracy theory that turned out to be</v>

2427
01:47:50.401 --> 01:47:53.160
<v Speaker 2>true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>please email me at [inaudible] dot com.</v>

2428
01:47:53.220 --> 01:47:55.290
<v Speaker 2>I would.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would love to be able to report on it.</v>

2429
01:47:55.680 --> 01:47:56.780
<v Speaker 2>One of those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the most,</v>

2430
01:47:57.510 --> 01:48:01.770
<v Speaker 2>one of those common episode requests I</v>
<v Speaker 2>get is for conspiracy theories that</v>

2431
01:48:01.771 --> 01:48:05.010
<v Speaker 2>turned out to be true and I always</v>
<v Speaker 2>answered that email with the same thing.</v>

2432
01:48:05.010 --> 01:48:05.610
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>great.</v>

2433
01:48:05.610 --> 01:48:07.620
<v Speaker 2>Give me a suggestion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been looking for him.</v>

2434
01:48:07.730 --> 01:48:12.540
<v Speaker 2>A lot of the times they confuse</v>
<v Speaker 2>incompetence with conspiracy as well.</v>

2435
01:48:12.900 --> 01:48:15.270
<v Speaker 2>Like here's one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Federal Reserve is a perpetual debt</v>

2436
01:48:15.271 --> 01:48:16.990
<v Speaker 2>machine that is designed to create</v>
<v Speaker 2>inflation.</v>

2437
01:48:17.020 --> 01:48:20.550
<v Speaker 2>Then it goes onto to show the US</v>
<v Speaker 2>national debt has gotten more than 5,000</v>

2438
01:48:20.551 --> 01:48:23.850
<v Speaker 2>times larger than the value of the US</v>
<v Speaker 2>dollar has fallen by more than 96</v>

2439
01:48:23.851 --> 01:48:25.230
<v Speaker 2>percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's more of an example of</v>

2440
01:48:25.231 --> 01:48:28.800
<v Speaker 2>greed and incompetence and just fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>fools running things than it is a</v>

2441
01:48:29.160 --> 01:48:32.250
<v Speaker 2>massive conspiracy to diminish the</v>
<v Speaker 2>wealth of the United States.</v>

2442
01:48:32.940 --> 01:48:34.350
<v Speaker 2>Just people are stealing from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>

2443
01:48:34.351 --> 01:48:37.170
<v Speaker 2>That's all it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They put cancer viruses in our vaccines</v>

2444
01:48:37.260 --> 01:48:39.840
<v Speaker 2>because you know this Brian Denny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that they've got all kinds of</v>

2445
01:48:39.841 --> 01:48:42.390
<v Speaker 2>different things in vaccines for</v>
<v Speaker 2>different purposes and a lot of the</v>

2446
01:48:42.391 --> 01:48:47.391
<v Speaker 2>times what the things that people report</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there are a boarded fetal tissue in</v>

2447
01:48:47.431 --> 01:48:52.431
<v Speaker 2>vaccines that's not completely untrue.</v>

2448
01:48:52.830 --> 01:48:57.830
<v Speaker 2>There are a certain certain certain</v>
<v Speaker 2>lines that can only be grown in human</v>

2449
01:48:58.201 --> 01:49:02.640
<v Speaker 2>tissue and so there's two particular</v>
<v Speaker 2>lines of fetal tissue that have existed</v>

2450
01:49:02.641 --> 01:49:06.360
<v Speaker 2>for boy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they're 40 or so years old now.</v>

2451
01:49:06.361 --> 01:49:11.130
<v Speaker 2>These two particular lines and we grow</v>
<v Speaker 2>the cultures in those in those tissues</v>

2452
01:49:11.131 --> 01:49:14.640
<v Speaker 2>have a human tissue and then the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The.</v>

2453
01:49:14.970 --> 01:49:17.700
<v Speaker 2>The cultures are removed from the tissue</v>
<v Speaker 2>once in a while.</v>

2454
01:49:17.701 --> 01:49:20.940
<v Speaker 2>Have spare cell or something will get</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuck in and be included with the</v>

2455
01:49:20.941 --> 01:49:24.120
<v Speaker 2>vaccine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not harmful in any way and it's</v>

2456
01:49:24.121 --> 01:49:26.580
<v Speaker 2>kind of misrepresents the white happens</v>
<v Speaker 2>to say that,</v>

2457
01:49:26.581 --> 01:49:29.790
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we include human fetal tissue in</v>

2458
01:49:29.791 --> 01:49:33.150
<v Speaker 2>vaccines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone sent me one that's legit.</v>

2459
01:49:33.180 --> 01:49:34.950
<v Speaker 2>The Gulf of Tonkin incident never</v>
<v Speaker 2>happened.</v>

2460
01:49:34.980 --> 01:49:37.170
<v Speaker 2>That was a conspiracy theory long before</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was ever proven.</v>

2461
01:49:37.171 --> 01:49:39.180
<v Speaker 2>True.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>

2462
01:49:41.550 --> 01:49:44.190
<v Speaker 2>I haven't done an episode on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's been a frequent request.</v>

2463
01:49:44.520 --> 01:49:45.840
<v Speaker 2>I'll put that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll put that,</v>

2464
01:49:45.900 --> 01:49:48.130
<v Speaker 2>bump that to the top of my.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a real one,</v>

2465
01:49:48.310 --> 01:49:50.620
<v Speaker 2>but I have a feeling that you're going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to somehow or another shaded so that</v>

2466
01:49:50.621 --> 01:49:54.910
<v Speaker 2>everything's gonna be okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to dance around it and make</v>

2467
01:49:54.911 --> 01:49:55.790
<v Speaker 2>it seem like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

2468
01:49:55.930 --> 01:49:59.830
<v Speaker 2>don't worry about me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about the Gulf of Tonkin was known</v>

2469
01:49:59.831 --> 01:50:03.880
<v Speaker 2>only to conspiracy theorists before law</v>
<v Speaker 2>enforcement slash media slash whoever</v>

2470
01:50:03.881 --> 01:50:05.320
<v Speaker 2>got ahold of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good question.</v>

2471
01:50:05.610 --> 01:50:06.300
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2472
01:50:06.300 --> 01:50:07.640
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what we're looking for.</v>

2473
01:50:07.930 --> 01:50:09.490
<v Speaker 2>How about the fact that it happened at</v>
<v Speaker 2>all?</v>

2474
01:50:09.520 --> 01:50:11.470
<v Speaker 2>That they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they actually did fake this incident</v>

2475
01:50:12.350 --> 01:50:16.360
<v Speaker 2>that is established historical facts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's saying that a conspiracy</v>

2476
01:50:16.361 --> 01:50:17.140
<v Speaker 2>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

2477
01:50:17.140 --> 01:50:19.870
<v Speaker 2>But that's not the same thing as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>conspiracy theory happened,</v>

2478
01:50:20.020 --> 01:50:22.350
<v Speaker 2>but no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was serious theorist who were,</v>

2479
01:50:22.420 --> 01:50:25.690
<v Speaker 2>who were shouting about it on the street</v>
<v Speaker 2>corners before it was discovered by the</v>

2480
01:50:25.691 --> 01:50:27.550
<v Speaker 2>general public or by law enforcement.</v>

2481
01:50:27.850 --> 01:50:30.610
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure that that was something that people</v>

2482
01:50:30.611 --> 01:50:32.290
<v Speaker 2>had talked about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2483
01:50:32.320 --> 01:50:36.040
<v Speaker 2>I mean obviously I'm too young to know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the Gulf of Tonkin conspiracy.</v>

2484
01:50:36.041 --> 01:50:38.470
<v Speaker 2>But I mean that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the information I'm looking for.</v>

2485
01:50:38.580 --> 01:50:41.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't have conspiracy theorists</v>

2486
01:50:41.500 --> 01:50:42.340
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2487
01:50:42.370 --> 01:50:46.720
<v Speaker 2>from their New York apartment basements</v>
<v Speaker 2>or wherever they were figured out these</v>

2488
01:50:46.721 --> 01:50:48.330
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2489
01:50:48.450 --> 01:50:50.830
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't say before with people who</v>

2490
01:50:50.831 --> 01:50:52.330
<v Speaker 2>should have known about them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>found out about them.</v>

2491
01:50:52.480 --> 01:50:54.250
<v Speaker 2>What about Watergate?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2492
01:50:54.251 --> 01:50:56.340
<v Speaker 2>that's not really a conspiracy theory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What that is,</v>

2493
01:50:56.341 --> 01:50:58.960
<v Speaker 2>is just standard operational procedure</v>
<v Speaker 2>amongst crux.</v>

2494
01:50:59.290 --> 01:51:01.780
<v Speaker 2>And then one guy got busted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was,</v>

2495
01:51:01.810 --> 01:51:05.380
<v Speaker 2>there was nobody knew that was Alex</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jones was not on his radio shows</v>

2496
01:51:05.381 --> 01:51:07.480
<v Speaker 2>screaming about what happened about</v>
<v Speaker 2>Watergate.</v>

2497
01:51:07.481 --> 01:51:10.000
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was a baby Bernstein and Woodward</v>

2498
01:51:10.001 --> 01:51:11.200
<v Speaker 2>report.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't even a baby.</v>

2499
01:51:11.201 --> 01:51:12.310
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't even born then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alex,</v>

2500
01:51:12.311 --> 01:51:14.230
<v Speaker 2>he's younger than me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He looks like he's 60,</v>

2501
01:51:14.350 --> 01:51:15.940
<v Speaker 2>but he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's 40.</v>

2502
01:51:16.180 --> 01:51:16.751
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2503
01:51:16.751 --> 01:51:18.010
<v Speaker 2>He's a young guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I first met him,</v>

2504
01:51:18.011 --> 01:51:20.230
<v Speaker 2>I believe he was 28 is actually younger</v>
<v Speaker 2>than me.</v>

2505
01:51:20.890 --> 01:51:22.060
<v Speaker 2>Correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's depressing.</v>

2506
01:51:22.061 --> 01:51:23.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he does look pretty bad.</v>

2507
01:51:23.291 --> 01:51:25.240
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't he?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking burns at both ends.</v>

2508
01:51:25.510 --> 01:51:26.950
<v Speaker 2>Alex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry if you're listening.</v>

2509
01:51:26.960 --> 01:51:27.760
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sweetie,</v>

2510
01:51:27.760 --> 01:51:29.170
<v Speaker 2>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a sweetie.</v>

2511
01:51:29.171 --> 01:51:30.580
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's fucking.</v>

2512
01:51:30.581 --> 01:51:31.181
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>

2513
01:51:31.181 --> 01:51:33.370
<v Speaker 2>your whole day was doing gloom and new</v>
<v Speaker 2>world order,</v>

2514
01:51:33.580 --> 01:51:35.590
<v Speaker 2>he'd be shitting your pants too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2515
01:51:35.710 --> 01:51:37.930
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if we got anywhere with any</v>
<v Speaker 2>of this talk,</v>

2516
01:51:37.990 --> 01:51:39.970
<v Speaker 2>but we still have plenty of time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2517
01:51:39.971 --> 01:51:40.870
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's,</v>

2518
01:51:40.920 --> 01:51:42.010
<v Speaker 2>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's continue.</v>

2519
01:51:42.370 --> 01:51:46.920
<v Speaker 2>I think I could shed light on a faulty</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking that I have had myself please.</v>

2520
01:51:47.050 --> 01:51:48.330
<v Speaker 2>And I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2521
01:51:48.500 --> 01:51:53.500
<v Speaker 2>I think that confirmation bias and that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can go online and find French sites</v>

2522
01:51:54.701 --> 01:51:58.240
<v Speaker 2>and all these different things that</v>
<v Speaker 2>support your ideas and then not</v>

2523
01:51:58.241 --> 01:52:00.510
<v Speaker 2>objectively look at it like completely</v>
<v Speaker 2>objective.</v>

2524
01:52:00.550 --> 01:52:03.820
<v Speaker 2>We all get attached.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We get our egos attached to statements</v>

2525
01:52:03.821 --> 01:52:06.070
<v Speaker 2>and we get our egos attached to</v>
<v Speaker 2>positions that we've taken.</v>

2526
01:52:06.400 --> 01:52:08.110
<v Speaker 2>And I think that those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those,</v>

2527
01:52:08.260 --> 01:52:12.100
<v Speaker 2>those egos and those statements and</v>
<v Speaker 2>positions that we've taken oftentimes</v>

2528
01:52:12.101 --> 01:52:17.101
<v Speaker 2>can be the enemy of objectivity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I agree with you that there are</v>

2529
01:52:17.740 --> 01:52:20.170
<v Speaker 2>most.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't say most things,</v>

2530
01:52:20.350 --> 01:52:23.350
<v Speaker 2>but when you're looking at information</v>
<v Speaker 2>online,</v>

2531
01:52:23.380 --> 01:52:26.830
<v Speaker 2>what you should do is look at all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>different arguments,</v>

2532
01:52:26.831 --> 01:52:29.700
<v Speaker 2>pro and con,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then look where the intelligence is</v>

2533
01:52:29.710 --> 01:52:31.630
<v Speaker 2>liquid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look where the smart people are leaning.</v>

2534
01:52:31.631 --> 01:52:33.430
<v Speaker 2>Look where the educated people are</v>
<v Speaker 2>leaning liquid.</v>

2535
01:52:33.431 --> 01:52:36.310
<v Speaker 2>The experts are leaning and try to</v>
<v Speaker 2>figure it out and also know that no</v>

2536
01:52:36.311 --> 01:52:41.220
<v Speaker 2>matter what there is in this world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you haven't been there and you know</v>

2537
01:52:41.230 --> 01:52:43.270
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're reading someone's take on it,</v>

2538
01:52:43.480 --> 01:52:46.190
<v Speaker 2>there's going to be a bunch of different</v>
<v Speaker 2>opposing</v>

2539
01:52:46.190 --> 01:52:49.580
<v Speaker 1>opinions that make no fucking sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's going to be some that are close.</v>

2540
01:52:49.820 --> 01:52:53.930
<v Speaker 1>There's going to be the full range from</v>
<v Speaker 1>from fucking whack a doodle.</v>

2541
01:52:53.960 --> 01:52:57.740
<v Speaker 1>The planes were holograms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was explosions that were looking</v>

2542
01:52:57.741 --> 01:52:59.300
<v Speaker 1>at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is not a civilian plane.</v>

2543
01:52:59.540 --> 01:52:59.961
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

2544
01:52:59.961 --> 01:53:00.241
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

2545
01:53:00.241 --> 01:53:03.860
<v Speaker 1>they took the people to the moon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's this wackadoodle shit on,</v>

2546
01:53:04.310 --> 01:53:06.530
<v Speaker 1>on every subject,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything that exists.</v>

2547
01:53:06.531 --> 01:53:08.320
<v Speaker 1>And some of it you have to wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2548
01:53:08.360 --> 01:53:12.590
<v Speaker 1>we know that there's techniques and</v>
<v Speaker 1>tactics of disinformation while they'll</v>

2549
01:53:12.620 --> 01:53:14.510
<v Speaker 1>take a bunch of things that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely true.</v>

2550
01:53:14.511 --> 01:53:17.180
<v Speaker 1>Then attachment to one thing that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>blatantly ridiculous,</v>

2551
01:53:17.450 --> 01:53:20.510
<v Speaker 1>and that one thing sort of diminishes</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the other things.</v>

2552
01:53:21.410 --> 01:53:25.640
<v Speaker 4>One thing that I always tell people and</v>
<v Speaker 4>I always get criticized for it is if you</v>

2553
01:53:25.641 --> 01:53:30.641
<v Speaker 4>have a question on any given matter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>go to the experts in that,</v>

2554
01:53:30.860 --> 01:53:32.660
<v Speaker 4>in that subject,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you want to know,</v>

2555
01:53:32.790 --> 01:53:37.190
<v Speaker 4>you know how old the earth is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>go to the people who actually work in</v>

2556
01:53:37.191 --> 01:53:39.320
<v Speaker 4>that field.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not always going to be right,</v>

2557
01:53:39.321 --> 01:53:41.630
<v Speaker 4>but you're going to be right far more</v>
<v Speaker 4>often than you're wrong.</v>

2558
01:53:42.110 --> 01:53:45.140
<v Speaker 4>So no matter what the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the pseudo sciences,</v>

2559
01:53:45.141 --> 01:53:46.610
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2560
01:53:46.630 --> 01:53:49.160
<v Speaker 4>a cancer bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cancer remedies.</v>

2561
01:53:49.460 --> 01:53:54.460
<v Speaker 4>If you want to know whether this works,</v>
<v Speaker 4>go to go to the experts in cancer,</v>

2562
01:53:55.610 --> 01:53:58.030
<v Speaker 4>go to the American cancer society,</v>
<v Speaker 4>et Cetera,</v>

2563
01:53:58.031 --> 01:53:59.870
<v Speaker 4>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You won't always be right,</v>

2564
01:53:59.871 --> 01:54:01.270
<v Speaker 4>but you'll be right far more often</v>

2565
01:54:01.400 --> 01:54:03.460
<v Speaker 1>then you're wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had a real problem with that on our</v>

2566
01:54:03.461 --> 01:54:05.890
<v Speaker 1>show with um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Peter Duesberg.</v>

2567
01:54:06.130 --> 01:54:09.640
<v Speaker 1>Peter Duesberg,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's a professor of biology at the</v>

2568
01:54:09.640 --> 01:54:10.473
<v Speaker 1>University of California,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Berkeley,</v>

2569
01:54:10.570 --> 01:54:14.050
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>esteemed scholar who also believes that</v>

2570
01:54:14.051 --> 01:54:18.610
<v Speaker 1>HIV doesn't cause aids and we had him on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the podcast and it was unbelievably</v>

2571
01:54:18.611 --> 01:54:21.940
<v Speaker 1>baffling and my statement was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very frustrating when you're too</v>

2572
01:54:21.941 --> 01:54:25.210
<v Speaker 1>dumb to know who stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was listening to him and</v>

2573
01:54:25.211 --> 01:54:29.050
<v Speaker 1>listening to the absolute outrage of all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the actual scientists that work in the</v>

2574
01:54:29.051 --> 01:54:33.460
<v Speaker 1>field of HIV research and how angry</v>
<v Speaker 1>people were about it.</v>

2575
01:54:33.461 --> 01:54:37.870
<v Speaker 1>And unfortunately I couldn't get anybody</v>
<v Speaker 1>to debate him and I think that much like</v>

2576
01:54:37.900 --> 01:54:42.250
<v Speaker 1>people are criticizing Bill Nye of</v>
<v Speaker 1>visiting the creation museum is almost</v>

2577
01:54:42.251 --> 01:54:44.830
<v Speaker 1>like people don't want to debate</v>
<v Speaker 1>holocaust deniers.</v>

2578
01:54:44.860 --> 01:54:48.670
<v Speaker 1>They did not want to debate this guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>because somehow or another it gives his</v>

2579
01:54:48.671 --> 01:54:49.504
<v Speaker 1>ideas.</v>

2580
01:54:49.660 --> 01:54:51.730
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I agree with that.</v>

2581
01:54:51.760 --> 01:54:56.440
<v Speaker 4>I would say just let them hang out in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the wind for anyone with any credibility</v>

2582
01:54:56.441 --> 01:54:58.510
<v Speaker 4>to spend time on that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're just,</v>

2583
01:54:58.540 --> 01:55:01.210
<v Speaker 4>you're communicating to the general</v>
<v Speaker 4>public that there's a question here that</v>

2584
01:55:01.211 --> 01:55:03.310
<v Speaker 4>needs to be looked at and that's not</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

2585
01:55:03.640 --> 01:55:04.280
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2586
01:55:04.280 --> 01:55:06.620
<v Speaker 1>It's baffling though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really confusing when you have this</v>

2587
01:55:06.621 --> 01:55:08.870
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just an incredibly intelligent</v>

2588
01:55:08.871 --> 01:55:13.160
<v Speaker 1>man who's very well respected in</v>
<v Speaker 1>educated and has done some amazing work</v>

2589
01:55:13.161 --> 01:55:15.290
<v Speaker 1>on cancer research as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So even since then,</v>

2590
01:55:15.291 --> 01:55:16.124
<v Speaker 1>so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2591
01:55:16.700 --> 01:55:17.533
<v Speaker 1>it's baffling.</v>

2592
01:55:17.610 --> 01:55:18.000
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let me,</v>

2593
01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:20.880
<v Speaker 4>let me ask you something else.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to kind of call you out a little</v>

2594
01:55:20.881 --> 01:55:22.690
<v Speaker 4>bit on something else.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2595
01:55:23.490 --> 01:55:25.980
<v Speaker 4>it's call you out of some new shit that</v>
<v Speaker 4>people are doing in the last 10 years.</v>

2596
01:55:25.990 --> 01:55:27.010
<v Speaker 4>No sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right on.</v>

2597
01:55:27.011 --> 01:55:27.440
<v Speaker 4>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2598
01:55:27.440 --> 01:55:28.590
<v Speaker 4>that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Before that,</v>

2599
01:55:30.010 --> 01:55:33.960
<v Speaker 4>nobody ever did any conspiracy theorists</v>
<v Speaker 4>believed that there would calling them.</v>

2600
01:55:34.410 --> 01:55:34.921
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2601
01:55:34.921 --> 01:55:37.410
<v Speaker 4>You had a guy on your show a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 4>weeks ago.</v>

2602
01:55:37.411 --> 01:55:38.580
<v Speaker 4>I tried to listen when I come on the</v>
<v Speaker 4>show,</v>

2603
01:55:38.581 --> 01:55:41.890
<v Speaker 4>I try to listen to some recent episodes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You had a guy on who was a doctor Dr</v>

2604
01:55:42.060 --> 01:55:44.460
<v Speaker 4>something or rather Gordon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mark.</v>

2605
01:55:44.520 --> 01:55:45.640
<v Speaker 4>Mark Gordon Martin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2606
01:55:47.280 --> 01:55:48.990
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I listened to that episode.</v>

2607
01:55:48.991 --> 01:55:51.510
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I turned it off in a rage at nine</v>

2608
01:55:51.511 --> 01:55:53.440
<v Speaker 4>minutes because I couldn't take anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2609
01:55:53.730 --> 01:55:57.060
<v Speaker 4>He came on and I believe you said you'd</v>
<v Speaker 4>had them on several times before.</v>

2610
01:55:57.061 --> 01:55:57.691
<v Speaker 4>Is that right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2611
01:55:57.691 --> 01:55:58.524
<v Speaker 4>he's my friend.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2612
01:55:58.540 --> 01:56:01.080
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the guy he came on and he starts</v>

2613
01:56:01.081 --> 01:56:05.550
<v Speaker 4>promoting his miracle supplement that</v>
<v Speaker 4>you take and you can drink as much</v>

2614
01:56:05.551 --> 01:56:07.140
<v Speaker 4>alcohol as you want,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not to get drunk.</v>

2615
01:56:07.200 --> 01:56:08.340
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's talking about glutathione.</v>

2616
01:56:08.370 --> 01:56:09.680
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wasn't saying it was me.</v>

2617
01:56:09.780 --> 01:56:13.170
<v Speaker 4>He was selling a product that you can</v>
<v Speaker 4>take it and you know he doesn't sell.</v>

2618
01:56:13.260 --> 01:56:16.470
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't sell gludethyon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I might.</v>

2619
01:56:16.530 --> 01:56:18.400
<v Speaker 4>He might beg to differ.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was the.</v>

2620
01:56:18.570 --> 01:56:20.600
<v Speaker 4>That was the central thrust of the first</v>
<v Speaker 4>nine minutes.</v>

2621
01:56:20.620 --> 01:56:22.520
<v Speaker 4>The episode I listened,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what I want,</v>

2622
01:56:22.610 --> 01:56:24.670
<v Speaker 4>what I want,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I might be correct or incorrect.</v>

2623
01:56:24.750 --> 01:56:26.760
<v Speaker 4>What I want to discuss with you is</v>
<v Speaker 4>something you said to him,</v>

2624
01:56:26.761 --> 01:56:29.790
<v Speaker 4>you said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you said that sounds too good to be</v>

2625
01:56:29.791 --> 01:56:30.700
<v Speaker 4>true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible].</v>

2626
01:56:31.050 --> 01:56:33.420
<v Speaker 4>I wish I knew enough to call you out on</v>
<v Speaker 4>your bullshit.</v>

2627
01:56:33.750 --> 01:56:34.583
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2628
01:56:36.540 --> 01:56:39.030
<v Speaker 4>You should have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You should have known enough to call</v>

2629
01:56:39.031 --> 01:56:40.290
<v Speaker 4>them out on your bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know he was gonna.</v>

2630
01:56:40.291 --> 01:56:41.790
<v Speaker 4>Bring that up if you're going to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2631
01:56:41.791 --> 01:56:42.271
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

2632
01:56:42.271 --> 01:56:43.270
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't like this.</v>

2633
01:56:43.310 --> 01:56:46.200
<v Speaker 4>The topic of conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like when when I have some on the show,</v>

2634
01:56:46.420 --> 01:56:49.530
<v Speaker 4>the the idea of having people in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>show is just a conversation just with</v>

2635
01:56:49.531 --> 01:56:50.310
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no.</v>

2636
01:56:50.310 --> 01:56:51.500
<v Speaker 4>We didn't discuss much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We said,</v>

2637
01:56:51.510 --> 01:56:52.860
<v Speaker 4>let's just have fun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's just talk.</v>

2638
01:56:53.240 --> 01:56:56.100
<v Speaker 4>The same thing with mark.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mark is a friend of mine and he's an</v>

2639
01:56:56.110 --> 01:56:58.920
<v Speaker 4>interesting guy and he can ramble on</v>
<v Speaker 4>forever and relay all sorts of</v>

2640
01:56:58.921 --> 01:57:01.110
<v Speaker 4>information.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's also an expert in traumatic brain</v>

2641
01:57:01.111 --> 01:57:02.520
<v Speaker 4>injury,</v>
<v Speaker 4>has helped a lot of soldiers,</v>

2642
01:57:02.521 --> 01:57:05.040
<v Speaker 4>helped a lot of athletes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have a lot of football players,</v>

2643
01:57:05.070 --> 01:57:07.140
<v Speaker 4>mixed martial arts fighters,</v>
<v Speaker 4>boxers.</v>

2644
01:57:07.330 --> 01:57:09.420
<v Speaker 4>He's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's helped a lot of people understand</v>

2645
01:57:09.421 --> 01:57:12.660
<v Speaker 4>the delicate balance of the of the human</v>
<v Speaker 4>mind and here's the thing,</v>

2646
01:57:12.661 --> 01:57:12.990
<v Speaker 4>is he.</v>

2647
01:57:12.990 --> 01:57:15.660
<v Speaker 4>He went on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he came on your show and told people</v>

2648
01:57:15.930 --> 01:57:18.930
<v Speaker 4>that here's a supplement they can take</v>
<v Speaker 4>and drink all they want and not get</v>

2649
01:57:18.931 --> 01:57:20.460
<v Speaker 4>drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That gets people killed.</v>

2650
01:57:21.270 --> 01:57:23.760
<v Speaker 4>People said that and and use,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right though.</v>

2651
01:57:24.180 --> 01:57:25.200
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's not right.</v>

2652
01:57:25.230 --> 01:57:26.940
<v Speaker 4>What happens when you take Gludethyon if</v>
<v Speaker 4>you drunk?</v>

2653
01:57:27.150 --> 01:57:29.970
<v Speaker 4>Does it have any effect?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The body is a lot more complicated than</v>

2654
01:57:29.971 --> 01:57:32.520
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a great example that I like to give</v>

2655
01:57:32.521 --> 01:57:36.270
<v Speaker 4>of this is the idea of oxidation and</v>
<v Speaker 4>antioxidants.</v>

2656
01:57:36.630 --> 01:57:39.050
<v Speaker 4>Oxidation causes aging.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It causes bad thing,</v>

2657
01:57:39.051 --> 01:57:42.420
<v Speaker 4>so take an antioxidant and that sounds</v>
<v Speaker 4>really simple,</v>

2658
01:57:42.421 --> 01:57:46.080
<v Speaker 4>but it's far more complex than that and</v>
<v Speaker 4>in fact it's so complicated.</v>

2659
01:57:46.081 --> 01:57:47.610
<v Speaker 4>That statement doesn't even mean</v>
<v Speaker 4>anything.</v>

2660
01:57:47.611 --> 01:57:49.200
<v Speaker 4>It's one of these things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so wrong.</v>

2661
01:57:49.201 --> 01:57:50.910
<v Speaker 4>It's not even wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>As the saying goes,</v>

2662
01:57:51.180 --> 01:57:55.890
<v Speaker 4>you can't just take something that's</v>
<v Speaker 4>produced in your liver and counter</v>

2663
01:57:55.950 --> 01:57:58.800
<v Speaker 4>effect counteract the effects of</v>
<v Speaker 4>drinking alcohol.</v>

2664
01:57:59.280 --> 01:58:04.280
<v Speaker 4>There is no direct line from anything</v>
<v Speaker 4>you eat to any part of your body.</v>

2665
01:58:04.950 --> 01:58:06.840
<v Speaker 4>If you take,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're working out,</v>

2666
01:58:06.841 --> 01:58:10.770
<v Speaker 4>if you're trying to get buff and you</v>
<v Speaker 4>take a protein supplement,</v>

2667
01:58:10.830 --> 01:58:11.551
<v Speaker 4>you thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

2668
01:58:11.551 --> 01:58:13.920
<v Speaker 4>protein coming in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's going to go to my muscles and</v>

2669
01:58:13.921 --> 01:58:16.800
<v Speaker 4>help them get strong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's something that is</v>

2670
01:58:18.850 --> 01:58:23.320
<v Speaker 4>incredibly wrong because it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it sounds so simplistically true.</v>

2671
01:58:24.010 --> 01:58:26.530
<v Speaker 4>It's not correct.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not the way the body works.</v>

2672
01:58:26.531 --> 01:58:28.480
<v Speaker 4>That's not the way the digestion system</v>
<v Speaker 4>works.</v>

2673
01:58:28.510 --> 01:58:32.920
<v Speaker 4>You cannot take something orally and</v>
<v Speaker 4>have it go as a direct line to any given</v>

2674
01:58:32.921 --> 01:58:35.410
<v Speaker 4>part of your body.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not the way our digestive system</v>

2675
01:58:35.710 --> 01:58:39.790
<v Speaker 4>and our blood works and when you say</v>
<v Speaker 4>that there's a supplement that can</v>

2676
01:58:39.791 --> 01:58:41.290
<v Speaker 4>prevent you from getting drunk,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your,</v>

2677
01:58:42.250 --> 01:58:43.180
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your,</v>

2678
01:58:43.240 --> 01:58:47.290
<v Speaker 4>your against all reasonably established</v>
<v Speaker 4>science and you're trying to.</v>

2679
01:58:47.320 --> 01:58:50.770
<v Speaker 4>You're trying to make a buck off of</v>
<v Speaker 4>people potentially getting killed and I</v>

2680
01:58:50.771 --> 01:58:53.380
<v Speaker 4>had a huge problem with that to the</v>
<v Speaker 4>point that I had to turn the show off.</v>

2681
01:58:54.010 --> 01:58:56.900
<v Speaker 4>I was just getting mad driving in my car</v>
<v Speaker 4>and.</v>

2682
01:58:57.460 --> 01:58:58.121
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>keep going.</v>

2683
01:58:58.121 --> 01:59:01.720
<v Speaker 4>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that that as someone with a huge</v>

2684
01:59:01.721 --> 01:59:04.660
<v Speaker 4>audience as you have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you have more of a</v>

2685
01:59:04.661 --> 01:59:08.830
<v Speaker 4>responsibility to make sure that people</v>
<v Speaker 4>like that are called out on it.</v>

2686
01:59:09.190 --> 01:59:10.210
<v Speaker 4>If you can.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you don't,</v>

2687
01:59:10.211 --> 01:59:13.090
<v Speaker 4>if he surprises you with it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then say,</v>

2688
01:59:13.150 --> 01:59:15.580
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then I've got to get someone on next</v>

2689
01:59:15.580 --> 01:59:16.420
<v Speaker 4>week.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got to go and get,</v>

2690
01:59:16.450 --> 01:59:16.960
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2691
01:59:16.960 --> 01:59:21.340
<v Speaker 4>Steven Novella or someone like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Someone who is a promoter of science</v>

2692
01:59:21.341 --> 01:59:25.240
<v Speaker 4>based medicine to counteract that</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I think you could have left some</v>

2693
01:59:25.241 --> 01:59:27.160
<v Speaker 4>of your listeners with the impression</v>
<v Speaker 4>that hey,</v>

2694
01:59:27.161 --> 01:59:31.180
<v Speaker 4>they can now buy something and drink all</v>
<v Speaker 4>they want and then drive home safely.</v>

2695
01:59:31.780 --> 01:59:32.530
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

2696
01:59:32.530 --> 01:59:34.810
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm looking online and immediately I</v>

2697
01:59:34.811 --> 01:59:37.450
<v Speaker 4>find articles that discussed glutathione</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's,</v>

2698
01:59:37.820 --> 01:59:40.160
<v Speaker 1>it's role,</v>
<v Speaker 1>vital role in alcohol,</v>

2699
01:59:40.161 --> 01:59:43.850
<v Speaker 1>detoxification in the liver.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It binds to the toxin,</v>

2700
01:59:43.920 --> 01:59:47.870
<v Speaker 1>a civilized which s s,</v>
<v Speaker 1>w a subtle d high,</v>

2701
01:59:47.900 --> 01:59:49.340
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what else to tell to hide</v>
<v Speaker 1>as.</v>

2702
01:59:49.341 --> 01:59:51.680
<v Speaker 1>Thank you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a byproduct is a product of</v>

2703
01:59:51.681 --> 01:59:54.920
<v Speaker 1>alcohol and is 10 to 30 times more toxic</v>
<v Speaker 1>than the alcohol itself.</v>

2704
01:59:55.130 --> 01:59:58.820
<v Speaker 1>Gludethyon then transfer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say it again after what asked to tell,</v>

2705
01:59:58.821 --> 02:00:02.420
<v Speaker 1>to hide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to hide into compounds that can be</v>

2706
02:00:02.421 --> 02:00:05.270
<v Speaker 1>excreted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alcohol therefore depletes our store of</v>

2707
02:00:05.271 --> 02:00:09.020
<v Speaker 1>glutathione when depleted by excessive</v>
<v Speaker 1>alcohol consumption,</v>

2708
02:00:09.021 --> 02:00:13.730
<v Speaker 1>gludethyon becomes unavailable for</v>
<v Speaker 1>normal and natural antioxidant effects</v>

2709
02:00:13.760 --> 02:00:17.660
<v Speaker 1>leading to a host of health problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this article is actually saying that</v>

2710
02:00:17.661 --> 02:00:19.370
<v Speaker 1>you should take glutathione when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>drink.</v>

2711
02:00:19.400 --> 02:00:20.090
<v Speaker 1>What you're talking about</v>

2712
02:00:20.090 --> 02:00:22.730
<v Speaker 4>about is reducing the effects of a</v>
<v Speaker 4>hangover,</v>

2713
02:00:22.731 --> 02:00:26.210
<v Speaker 4>getting over the hangover quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It does not underscored,</v>

2714
02:00:26.240 --> 02:00:30.300
<v Speaker 4>does not prevent you from getting drunk</v>
<v Speaker 4>or in any way mitigate the,</v>

2715
02:00:30.380 --> 02:00:31.213
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the</v>

2716
02:00:31.230 --> 02:00:34.200
<v Speaker 1>intox alcohol effects of the also it</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't diminish it or shrink it.</v>

2717
02:00:34.201 --> 02:00:36.960
<v Speaker 1>Like as if he said he does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a believable one of his</v>

2718
02:00:36.961 --> 02:00:38.490
<v Speaker 1>statements were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that when you were drunk you could</v>

2719
02:00:38.491 --> 02:00:39.690
<v Speaker 1>take this stuff and it would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2720
02:00:39.960 --> 02:00:41.550
<v Speaker 1>it would bring you back to baseline</v>
<v Speaker 1>rather quick.</v>

2721
02:00:41.680 --> 02:00:43.780
<v Speaker 4>That is not true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can reduce the effects of a</v>

2722
02:00:43.781 --> 02:00:46.510
<v Speaker 4>hangover,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you cannot prevent yourself from</v>

2723
02:00:46.511 --> 02:00:46.970
<v Speaker 4>getting.</v>

2724
02:00:46.970 --> 02:00:49.130
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever tried this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know this for a fact?</v>

2725
02:00:49.700 --> 02:00:51.190
<v Speaker 1>I've never tried his product.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2726
02:00:51.210 --> 02:00:51.520
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2727
02:00:51.520 --> 02:00:53.900
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's not as product.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Luda is available pretty much</v>

2728
02:00:53.901 --> 02:00:55.430
<v Speaker 1>everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you could buy it in health food</v>

2729
02:00:55.431 --> 02:00:56.510
<v Speaker 1>stores.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can buy it online.</v>

2730
02:00:56.560 --> 02:01:00.280
<v Speaker 4>I have never tried anyone's product that</v>
<v Speaker 4>was intended as a</v>

2731
02:01:00.460 --> 02:01:04.330
<v Speaker 1>miracle drunk cure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I mean it would make sense though</v>

2732
02:01:04.331 --> 02:01:07.090
<v Speaker 1>that if alcohol and alcohol consumption</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>

2733
02:01:07.120 --> 02:01:09.160
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reaction that has in the body,</v>

2734
02:01:09.161 --> 02:01:12.670
<v Speaker 1>it's a chemical reaction that there</v>
<v Speaker 1>could be possibly something that could</v>

2735
02:01:12.671 --> 02:01:14.770
<v Speaker 1>counterbalance it or swing it in one way</v>
<v Speaker 1>or another.</v>

2736
02:01:14.800 --> 02:01:17.770
<v Speaker 1>Just like many other chemical reactions</v>
<v Speaker 1>and symbiotic reactions that we have to</v>

2737
02:01:17.771 --> 02:01:20.680
<v Speaker 1>things inside the body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now when you read something about this,</v>

2738
02:01:20.980 --> 02:01:24.970
<v Speaker 1>it seems like what you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your dispute is that he said that it</v>

2739
02:01:24.971 --> 02:01:28.270
<v Speaker 1>could diminish the effects of alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like while you're drunk and you're</v>

2740
02:01:28.271 --> 02:01:31.000
<v Speaker 1>saying that's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just helps with the hangover.</v>

2741
02:01:31.001 --> 02:01:33.190
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it helps with a hangover,</v>

2742
02:01:33.191 --> 02:01:34.870
<v Speaker 1>it's still really potent and pretty</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>

2743
02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:37.330
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would like to do a test on it.</v>

2744
02:01:37.331 --> 02:01:40.310
<v Speaker 1>I would like to see two people's blood</v>
<v Speaker 1>alcohol levels measured.</v>

2745
02:01:40.370 --> 02:01:41.990
<v Speaker 1>I think if you don't do that test.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2746
02:01:42.020 --> 02:01:43.880
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you fucking saying something kind of</v>

2747
02:01:43.881 --> 02:01:45.320
<v Speaker 1>irresponsible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which he did.</v>

2748
02:01:45.500 --> 02:01:47.000
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that test has been done</v>
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

2749
02:01:47.750 --> 02:01:48.583
<v Speaker 1>Do you?</v>

2750
02:01:49.860 --> 02:01:53.690
<v Speaker 4>I have not searched the literature for</v>
<v Speaker 4>what if it has been done and he's right</v>

2751
02:01:54.140 --> 02:01:57.230
<v Speaker 4>then that would have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That would have been all over the</v>

2752
02:01:57.231 --> 02:01:59.570
<v Speaker 4>literature.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is someone who feels follows the</v>

2753
02:01:59.571 --> 02:02:02.330
<v Speaker 4>literature fairly closely?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can tell you that it has not been all</v>

2754
02:02:02.331 --> 02:02:05.270
<v Speaker 4>over the literature that you can now</v>
<v Speaker 4>drink and not get drunk.</v>

2755
02:02:05.840 --> 02:02:07.760
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean maybe he was exaggerating.</v>

2756
02:02:08.030 --> 02:02:10.490
<v Speaker 4>I think he was exaggerating because he</v>
<v Speaker 4>was selling a product.</v>

2757
02:02:11.060 --> 02:02:11.980
<v Speaker 4>That's what it was</v>

2758
02:02:11.990 --> 02:02:13.970
<v Speaker 1>because he doesn't have a store.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't have anything.</v>

2759
02:02:13.971 --> 02:02:14.804
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not.</v>

2760
02:02:14.870 --> 02:02:17.120
<v Speaker 1>When you say selling a product,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whereas he selling out of.</v>

2761
02:02:17.570 --> 02:02:18.440
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't have a store.</v>

2762
02:02:18.490 --> 02:02:20.760
<v Speaker 4>I don't really look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this was the nine minutes of his</v>

2763
02:02:20.770 --> 02:02:22.570
<v Speaker 4>episode.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was talking about what he sells.</v>

2764
02:02:22.960 --> 02:02:25.780
<v Speaker 4>If I'm wrong about that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then I'm damn wrong about it.</v>

2765
02:02:25.781 --> 02:02:29.800
<v Speaker 4>And I'm surprised.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is another thing is that is a thing</v>

2766
02:02:29.801 --> 02:02:33.670
<v Speaker 4>that's talking about a saving you from</v>
<v Speaker 4>being too drunk because of taking</v>

2767
02:02:33.671 --> 02:02:36.220
<v Speaker 4>glutathione before you drink.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where are you seeing it?</v>

2768
02:02:36.680 --> 02:02:39.110
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some fucking journal.</v>

2769
02:02:39.560 --> 02:02:40.280
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

2770
02:02:40.280 --> 02:02:43.220
<v Speaker 1>there's a long look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's impossible to have a conversation</v>

2771
02:02:43.221 --> 02:02:44.840
<v Speaker 1>and Google things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

2772
02:02:45.590 --> 02:02:46.550
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2773
02:02:46.730 --> 02:02:48.080
<v Speaker 1>it's also one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2774
02:02:48.081 --> 02:02:50.810
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a scientific article on reddit about</v>

2775
02:02:50.811 --> 02:02:53.240
<v Speaker 1>large amounts of glutathione,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2776
02:02:53.241 --> 02:02:58.241
<v Speaker 1>have the potential to sober people up in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a very short time that we're researching</v>

2777
02:02:58.401 --> 02:02:59.570
<v Speaker 1>a chemical drug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is.</v>

2778
02:02:59.630 --> 02:03:00.321
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2779
02:03:00.321 --> 02:03:02.120
<v Speaker 1>there's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not the only one that's talking</v>

2780
02:03:02.121 --> 02:03:04.820
<v Speaker 1>about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is being discussed in many</v>

2781
02:03:04.821 --> 02:03:07.250
<v Speaker 1>different forms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if he's right or wrong,</v>

2782
02:03:07.251 --> 02:03:11.150
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think you do either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would like to have him on with someone</v>

2783
02:03:11.151 --> 02:03:13.910
<v Speaker 1>who disputes it and find out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's what I would recommend.</v>

2784
02:03:13.911 --> 02:03:18.911
<v Speaker 1>He's a very smart guy and he wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying that many outlandish things where</v>

2785
02:03:19.011 --> 02:03:22.370
<v Speaker 1>I'd have to pull them down like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>towers were destroyed by Tesla</v>

2786
02:03:22.371 --> 02:03:24.290
<v Speaker 1>technology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not the same doctor.</v>

2787
02:03:24.800 --> 02:03:26.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a pretty reasonable guy.</v>

2788
02:03:26.211 --> 02:03:27.470
<v Speaker 1>He's a little bit out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

2789
02:03:27.471 --> 02:03:29.470
<v Speaker 1>He's kind of Wacky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but literacy out there.</v>

2790
02:03:29.860 --> 02:03:31.190
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's out there on.</v>

2791
02:03:31.760 --> 02:03:34.750
<v Speaker 1>A</v>
<v Speaker 1>good thing to say is out there.</v>

2792
02:03:35.530 --> 02:03:37.820
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd have to listen to her to go over.</v>

2793
02:03:37.821 --> 02:03:41.110
<v Speaker 1>I liked the guy a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm very biased when it comes to him.</v>

2794
02:03:41.120 --> 02:03:42.920
<v Speaker 1>He's a fun guy and he's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very smart,</v>

2795
02:03:43.250 --> 02:03:47.900
<v Speaker 1>but I'm looking at more than one thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's showing that you could advance</v>

2796
02:03:47.901 --> 02:03:50.870
<v Speaker 1>your sobriety,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you could sober up quicker by taking</v>

2797
02:03:50.980 --> 02:03:54.050
<v Speaker 1>glutathione.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if they're right or he's</v>

2798
02:03:54.051 --> 02:03:55.820
<v Speaker 1>right or you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know.</v>

2799
02:03:55.821 --> 02:03:57.170
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that you should be saying</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2800
02:03:57.171 --> 02:03:59.060
<v Speaker 1>If you're not a doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if it turns out?</v>

2801
02:03:59.061 --> 02:03:59.894
<v Speaker 1>That is true.</v>

2802
02:03:59.910 --> 02:04:00.940
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not a doctor,</v>

2803
02:04:00.941 --> 02:04:02.530
<v Speaker 4>but I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a science writer and I,</v>

2804
02:04:02.620 --> 02:04:04.540
<v Speaker 4>I do google.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do follow this stuff.</v>

2805
02:04:04.570 --> 02:04:07.090
<v Speaker 4>I've written on Google.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did an episode.</v>

2806
02:04:07.091 --> 02:04:08.380
<v Speaker 4>Uh Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>probably three,</v>

2807
02:04:08.381 --> 02:04:13.381
<v Speaker 4>four months ago on a hangover.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What exactly is the cause of a hangover?</v>

2808
02:04:14.080 --> 02:04:16.210
<v Speaker 4>What's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's the nature of the toxicity?</v>

2809
02:04:16.240 --> 02:04:20.410
<v Speaker 4>He could use that information when it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>a really complicated subject.</v>

2810
02:04:20.440 --> 02:04:23.590
<v Speaker 4>It's an immunosuppressant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The dehydration.</v>

2811
02:04:23.591 --> 02:04:24.610
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of factors,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2812
02:04:24.700 --> 02:04:27.520
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it basically comes down to a,</v>

2813
02:04:28.530 --> 02:04:30.460
<v Speaker 4>it's a depletion of glutathione in your</v>
<v Speaker 4>body.</v>

2814
02:04:30.461 --> 02:04:33.640
<v Speaker 4>Can't keep up with it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sounds like Dr Gordon's,</v>

2815
02:04:33.641 --> 02:04:34.330
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2816
02:04:34.330 --> 02:04:37.290
<v Speaker 4>it's not as simple as that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the thing is it's easy to sell</v>

2817
02:04:37.291 --> 02:04:38.220
<v Speaker 4>products by giving</v>

2818
02:04:38.220 --> 02:04:40.590
<v Speaker 2>an oversimplified description.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling you though,</v>

2819
02:04:40.591 --> 02:04:41.011
<v Speaker 2>you like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

2820
02:04:41.011 --> 02:04:43.290
<v Speaker 2>you're pinning it on this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't have a store.</v>

2821
02:04:43.620 --> 02:04:45.090
<v Speaker 2>Like you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's selling products.</v>

2822
02:04:45.091 --> 02:04:46.560
<v Speaker 2>He's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's not selling anything.</v>

2823
02:04:47.090 --> 02:04:49.950
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was certainly talking about a product</v>

2824
02:04:49.951 --> 02:04:51.320
<v Speaker 2>that's available.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not his,</v>

2825
02:04:51.900 --> 02:04:53.640
<v Speaker 2>but he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was talking to me about it even</v>

2826
02:04:53.641 --> 02:04:56.080
<v Speaker 2>before the podcast that he takes it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2827
02:04:56.310 --> 02:04:57.180
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2828
02:04:57.210 --> 02:05:01.500
<v Speaker 2>Dave asprey from bulletproof exec.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He takes a glutathione but he never</v>

2829
02:05:01.501 --> 02:05:03.880
<v Speaker 2>brought up anything about it doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything for,</v>

2830
02:05:03.881 --> 02:05:05.250
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for alcohol.</v>

2831
02:05:05.251 --> 02:05:05.560
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2832
02:05:05.560 --> 02:05:07.380
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would just like to leave you with,</v>

2833
02:05:07.410 --> 02:05:11.700
<v Speaker 2>with the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my opinion that sense listeners got the</v>

2834
02:05:11.701 --> 02:05:14.040
<v Speaker 2>impression that here's something that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can take and drink.</v>

2835
02:05:14.041 --> 02:05:17.610
<v Speaker 2>All they want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not get drunk is potentially lethal</v>

2836
02:05:17.611 --> 02:05:18.390
<v Speaker 2>advice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2837
02:05:18.390 --> 02:05:21.090
<v Speaker 2>Who else got that information?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who me.</v>

2838
02:05:21.690 --> 02:05:26.250
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it's right either me and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the listeners got fed some information</v>

2839
02:05:26.251 --> 02:05:26.970
<v Speaker 2>that we don't know what's right.</v>

2840
02:05:26.970 --> 02:05:29.400
<v Speaker 2>I don't have any obligation other than</v>
<v Speaker 2>to talk to people.</v>

2841
02:05:29.610 --> 02:05:32.190
<v Speaker 2>My obligation is to ask questions if I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>curious,</v>

2842
02:05:32.191 --> 02:05:34.870
<v Speaker 2>but in broadcasting this things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I make the,</v>

2843
02:05:34.910 --> 02:05:37.200
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the very clear distinction that I'm not</v>

2844
02:05:37.201 --> 02:05:38.730
<v Speaker 2>an expert.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the fuck I'm talking</v>

2845
02:05:38.731 --> 02:05:42.030
<v Speaker 2>about when I'm talking about things like</v>
<v Speaker 2>health and medicine and,</v>

2846
02:05:42.300 --> 02:05:45.060
<v Speaker 2>but I'm fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if I'm talking to someone and they're</v>

2847
02:05:45.061 --> 02:05:47.600
<v Speaker 2>an expert and they bring up something</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I didn't prepare for,</v>

2848
02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:50.410
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to ask him questions about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

2849
02:05:50.580 --> 02:05:52.920
<v Speaker 2>I will say I wish I knew if you're full</v>
<v Speaker 2>of shit,</v>

2850
02:05:53.130 --> 02:05:56.790
<v Speaker 2>but that's about as good as I could do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The reason I had the reason I initially</v>

2851
02:05:56.791 --> 02:05:59.610
<v Speaker 2>did this episode,</v>
<v Speaker 2>excuse me five years ago,</v>

2852
02:05:59.611 --> 02:06:04.611
<v Speaker 2>about celebrities who promote harmful</v>
<v Speaker 2>pseudoscience is because when you have a</v>

2853
02:06:05.521 --> 02:06:08.250
<v Speaker 2>large audience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe you do have an obligation to</v>

2854
02:06:08.251 --> 02:06:09.990
<v Speaker 2>not give harmful information.</v>

2855
02:06:10.620 --> 02:06:13.080
<v Speaker 2>But I'm not giving it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think for a minute that you've</v>

2856
02:06:13.081 --> 02:06:15.750
<v Speaker 2>ever knowingly given any harmful</v>
<v Speaker 2>information.</v>

2857
02:06:15.751 --> 02:06:19.380
<v Speaker 2>I'm not accusing you of anything at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if it has been given by one of your</v>

2858
02:06:19.381 --> 02:06:22.020
<v Speaker 2>guests and you are in the position of</v>
<v Speaker 2>having to say,</v>

2859
02:06:22.950 --> 02:06:24.990
<v Speaker 2>that sounds too good to be true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wish I was.</v>

2860
02:06:25.110 --> 02:06:27.570
<v Speaker 2>I wish I knew enough to call you out on</v>
<v Speaker 2>your bullshit.</v>

2861
02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:31.770
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems to me like a reasonable step to</v>

2862
02:06:31.771 --> 02:06:34.920
<v Speaker 2>follow that up with would have been to</v>
<v Speaker 2>find out with</v>

2863
02:06:36.510 --> 02:06:38.400
<v Speaker 2>get somebody on who can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who can,</v>

2864
02:06:38.401 --> 02:06:40.140
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who can address the other side of that</v>

2865
02:06:40.141 --> 02:06:43.170
<v Speaker 2>question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Perhaps I can turn this around on you</v>

2866
02:06:43.171 --> 02:06:47.100
<v Speaker 2>and say it would be so easy for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to research all those different</v>

2867
02:06:47.101 --> 02:06:49.410
<v Speaker 2>things on that list that you accused me</v>
<v Speaker 2>of many of them,</v>

2868
02:06:49.411 --> 02:06:51.750
<v Speaker 2>which are not true at all and never have</v>
<v Speaker 2>been true,</v>

2869
02:06:51.751 --> 02:06:52.830
<v Speaker 2>but yet you printed them.</v>

2870
02:06:52.890 --> 02:06:54.270
<v Speaker 2>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So why did you do that?</v>

2871
02:06:54.271 --> 02:06:57.630
<v Speaker 2>If you're a man of science information,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would you possibly have had?</v>

2872
02:06:57.631 --> 02:07:00.890
<v Speaker 2>Because I was using the Internet in 2008</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I look,</v>

2873
02:07:01.230 --> 02:07:02.250
<v Speaker 2>look every,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every,</v>

2874
02:07:02.490 --> 02:07:03.830
<v Speaker 2>every,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably three,</v>

2875
02:07:03.840 --> 02:07:06.090
<v Speaker 2>four months or so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do an episode that is nothing but</v>

2876
02:07:06.091 --> 02:07:08.640
<v Speaker 2>corrections,</v>
<v Speaker 2>corrections of things I've been wrong</v>

2877
02:07:08.641 --> 02:07:11.640
<v Speaker 2>about in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a great plan.</v>

2878
02:07:11.850 --> 02:07:14.520
<v Speaker 2>I think it's great that I do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to continue doing it.</v>

2879
02:07:14.670 --> 02:07:16.740
<v Speaker 2>I will need more things to be wrong</v>
<v Speaker 2>about so I can produce.</v>

2880
02:07:16.741 --> 02:07:19.620
<v Speaker 2>Those episodes were often,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what you vote is very specific and</v>

2881
02:07:19.621 --> 02:07:23.850
<v Speaker 2>what I want and what I came here today</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do was to find out which of those are</v>

2882
02:07:23.851 --> 02:07:26.800
<v Speaker 2>wrong and so that I will correct them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2883
02:07:26.801 --> 02:07:29.580
<v Speaker 2>but even this one thing you just said he</v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't selling it,</v>

2884
02:07:29.730 --> 02:07:31.890
<v Speaker 2>but you got that wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're saying that he was selling.</v>

2885
02:07:31.920 --> 02:07:35.440
<v Speaker 2>That wasn't on my show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was listening to this show it wrong</v>

2886
02:07:35.441 --> 02:07:36.130
<v Speaker 2>and you're saying it's</v>

2887
02:07:36.130 --> 02:07:40.360
<v Speaker 4>true and so now you're sending it out to</v>
<v Speaker 4>the road that this guy sells a product.</v>

2888
02:07:40.361 --> 02:07:42.340
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're doing the exact same thing that</v>

2889
02:07:42.370 --> 02:07:46.240
<v Speaker 4>you're blaming joe for.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2890
02:07:46.241 --> 02:07:46.790
<v Speaker 4>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2891
02:07:46.790 --> 02:07:49.300
<v Speaker 4>I.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You are though.</v>

2892
02:07:49.450 --> 02:07:51.450
<v Speaker 4>You're saying this guy sells something</v>
<v Speaker 4>when he doesn't.</v>

2893
02:07:51.690 --> 02:07:54.790
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You said that's hardly the salient</v>

2894
02:07:54.791 --> 02:07:56.620
<v Speaker 4>point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The salient point is that information is</v>

2895
02:07:56.621 --> 02:07:58.270
<v Speaker 4>being given that could potentially kill</v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

2896
02:07:58.300 --> 02:08:00.670
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but your information</v>

2897
02:08:00.730 --> 02:08:03.820
<v Speaker 1>as a medical expert,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which he is under the guise of selling a</v>

2898
02:08:03.821 --> 02:08:05.500
<v Speaker 1>product which is erroneous.</v>

2899
02:08:05.540 --> 02:08:06.111
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I've.</v>

2900
02:08:06.111 --> 02:08:08.540
<v Speaker 4>I've also said that I don't know whether</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's his store,</v>

2901
02:08:08.541 --> 02:08:10.790
<v Speaker 4>someone else's store,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's a product that he's talking</v>

2902
02:08:10.791 --> 02:08:13.910
<v Speaker 4>about that's the salient point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whether it's his store,</v>

2903
02:08:13.911 --> 02:08:16.850
<v Speaker 4>someone else's store doesn't really make</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lick of difference compared to the</v>

2904
02:08:16.851 --> 02:08:17.930
<v Speaker 4>fact that it's potentially</v>

2905
02:08:18.820 --> 02:08:22.330
<v Speaker 1>saying that he doesn't believe in it or</v>
<v Speaker 1>that if he believes in it he's wrong and</v>

2906
02:08:22.331 --> 02:08:24.820
<v Speaker 1>when he's saying is that he uses it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't sell it.</v>

2907
02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:27.550
<v Speaker 1>And you're saying that he's saying that</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he sells it.</v>

2908
02:08:27.700 --> 02:08:30.760
<v Speaker 1>That was very specific.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You had taken this very cynical approach</v>

2909
02:08:30.761 --> 02:08:32.270
<v Speaker 1>to why he's disseminating this</v>
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>

2910
02:08:32.271 --> 02:08:33.071
<v Speaker 1>Fair enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2911
02:08:33.071 --> 02:08:35.710
<v Speaker 1>and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm right now if I said that I was wrong</v>

2912
02:08:35.711 --> 02:08:36.550
<v Speaker 1>on this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sweetie,</v>

2913
02:08:36.551 --> 02:08:37.384
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

2914
02:08:37.490 --> 02:08:39.430
<v Speaker 4>and that's to say that these aren't dumb</v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

2915
02:08:39.431 --> 02:08:41.830
<v Speaker 4>They can't realize that they're drunk</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they're taking a pill and they're</v>

2916
02:08:41.831 --> 02:08:42.341
<v Speaker 4>going to go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2917
02:08:42.341 --> 02:08:44.580
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I said to him why I was.</v>

2918
02:08:45.430 --> 02:08:46.900
<v Speaker 1>That sounds like horse shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You did.</v>

2919
02:08:47.110 --> 02:08:48.310
<v Speaker 1>You did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know.</v>

2920
02:08:48.311 --> 02:08:49.840
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a fucking smart guy.</v>

2921
02:08:49.870 --> 02:08:52.060
<v Speaker 1>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know for a fact that that guy has</v>

2922
02:08:52.061 --> 02:08:54.280
<v Speaker 1>helped a lot of people with traumatic</v>
<v Speaker 1>brain injury.</v>

2923
02:08:54.310 --> 02:08:57.070
<v Speaker 1>That's a different subject,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's a doctor.</v>

2924
02:08:57.071 --> 02:09:00.910
<v Speaker 1>He's a legit scientist and a doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's a really brilliant guy.</v>

2925
02:09:01.030 --> 02:09:05.420
<v Speaker 1>So when he talks to me about the issues</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a pituitary gland and impacts and</v>

2926
02:09:05.650 --> 02:09:09.910
<v Speaker 1>his expertise on the human mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that relates to me that he has a very</v>

2927
02:09:09.911 --> 02:09:11.830
<v Speaker 1>vast understanding of the human body</v>
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>

2928
02:09:12.070 --> 02:09:14.200
<v Speaker 1>When he tells me something like this and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I started reading that,</v>

2929
02:09:14.201 --> 02:09:17.590
<v Speaker 1>there's more than one different article</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sort of confirms what he's saying.</v>

2930
02:09:18.130 --> 02:09:21.160
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might've gotten harsh on my friend</v>

2931
02:09:21.161 --> 02:09:24.060
<v Speaker 1>Dr Gordon for no reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

2932
02:09:24.070 --> 02:09:25.330
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a very good reason.</v>

2933
02:09:25.560 --> 02:09:27.460
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If if he's giving,</v>

2934
02:09:27.790 --> 02:09:30.550
<v Speaker 1>he's giving advice that's potentially</v>
<v Speaker 1>killing people.</v>

2935
02:09:30.850 --> 02:09:35.290
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a very good reason to err</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the side of this information should</v>

2936
02:09:35.291 --> 02:09:36.370
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Should be checked.</v>

2937
02:09:36.430 --> 02:09:39.580
<v Speaker 1>That's true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you're so dumb that you're just</v>

2938
02:09:39.760 --> 02:09:42.790
<v Speaker 1>just pound in alcohol and trusting the</v>
<v Speaker 1>glutathione is going to do it,</v>

2939
02:09:42.791 --> 02:09:44.890
<v Speaker 1>it's going to kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a Darwin award winner.</v>

2940
02:09:45.550 --> 02:09:50.550
<v Speaker 1>If you're using spotify on to fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>know he's not saying drink all you want</v>

2941
02:09:51.731 --> 02:09:52.750
<v Speaker 1>and you're going to be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2942
02:09:52.751 --> 02:09:55.020
<v Speaker 1>he never said that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He never said there's no risk involved.</v>

2943
02:09:55.510 --> 02:09:57.910
<v Speaker 1>What he was saying is it can help you</v>
<v Speaker 1>get sober quicker.</v>

2944
02:09:57.911 --> 02:10:00.160
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if he's right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think you do either.</v>

2945
02:10:00.760 --> 02:10:02.690
<v Speaker 1>That's not what I heard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you.</v>

2946
02:10:02.730 --> 02:10:05.260
<v Speaker 1>What did you hear?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I heard him say you can drink and not</v>

2947
02:10:05.261 --> 02:10:08.020
<v Speaker 1>get drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can listen to it on the Internet.</v>

2948
02:10:08.390 --> 02:10:10.040
<v Speaker 1>See if you could pull it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you give pull.</v>

2949
02:10:10.080 --> 02:10:13.360
<v Speaker 1>If there's a very small sample that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>could find.</v>

2950
02:10:13.590 --> 02:10:15.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we're kind of splitting hairs</v>

2951
02:10:15.401 --> 02:10:19.120
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could see why you'd be upset and I</v>

2952
02:10:19.121 --> 02:10:22.840
<v Speaker 1>could see why you would think that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>have the responsibility to call someone</v>

2953
02:10:22.841 --> 02:10:25.090
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have to be the expert on a</v>

2954
02:10:25.090 --> 02:10:27.230
<v Speaker 1>million different things and then I</v>
<v Speaker 1>would have to have people on and have</v>

2955
02:10:27.231 --> 02:10:31.780
<v Speaker 1>people counteract them and have people</v>
<v Speaker 1>go back and forth and debates and that's</v>

2956
02:10:31.781 --> 02:10:36.110
<v Speaker 1>all well and good in the real world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you can organize those debates and if</v>

2957
02:10:36.111 --> 02:10:39.380
<v Speaker 1>you get those people together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for the most part I'm lucky to get</v>

2958
02:10:39.381 --> 02:10:42.500
<v Speaker 1>someone to sit down once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm lucky to get someone who can fit</v>

2959
02:10:42.501 --> 02:10:45.470
<v Speaker 1>into a times that I have and have them</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the show and I just want to have a</v>

2960
02:10:45.471 --> 02:10:46.370
<v Speaker 1>conversation with them.</v>

2961
02:10:46.580 --> 02:10:48.890
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have any idea that God was</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to bring up glutathione.</v>

2962
02:10:49.110 --> 02:10:51.650
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we wanted to highlight his work on</v>

2963
02:10:52.010 --> 02:10:55.490
<v Speaker 1>traumatic brain injury because there's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>big issue with mixed martial arts these</v>

2964
02:10:55.490 --> 02:10:59.090
<v Speaker 1>days and the big issue is there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>twofold.</v>

2965
02:10:59.330 --> 02:11:03.560
<v Speaker 1>One traumatic brain injury and to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>depletion of testosterone because of</v>

2966
02:11:03.561 --> 02:11:06.770
<v Speaker 1>traumatic brain injury.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's been shown in people that have come</v>

2967
02:11:06.771 --> 02:11:11.420
<v Speaker 1>back from war and suffered a head</v>
<v Speaker 1>injuries and it's been shown from boxers</v>

2968
02:11:11.421 --> 02:11:16.310
<v Speaker 1>and people that have sustained long term</v>
<v Speaker 1>even subconcussive impacts to the head</v>

2969
02:11:16.311 --> 02:11:21.311
<v Speaker 1>that the pituitary gland gets fucked up</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's trying to sort of spread this</v>

2970
02:11:21.651 --> 02:11:26.120
<v Speaker 1>information and keep fighters from</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking testosterone to counteract that</v>

2971
02:11:26.121 --> 02:11:28.730
<v Speaker 1>and then competing to and continuing to</v>
<v Speaker 1>compete,</v>

2972
02:11:29.030 --> 02:11:33.470
<v Speaker 1>continuing to damage the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's an issue in mixed martial arts</v>

2973
02:11:33.471 --> 02:11:36.230
<v Speaker 1>and it's one of the reasons why I had</v>
<v Speaker 1>him on because he's a,</v>

2974
02:11:36.290 --> 02:11:37.160
<v Speaker 1>he's a brilliant guy.</v>

2975
02:11:37.490 --> 02:11:40.430
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he is very troubled by this idea that</v>

2976
02:11:40.431 --> 02:11:43.910
<v Speaker 1>we're going to put a bandaid on</v>
<v Speaker 1>traumatic brain injury by giving these</v>

2977
02:11:43.911 --> 02:11:46.850
<v Speaker 1>guys testosterone use exemptions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He thinks it's wrong.</v>

2978
02:11:47.120 --> 02:11:51.680
<v Speaker 1>He thinks if your body is producing less</v>
<v Speaker 1>testosterone because of impacts,</v>

2979
02:11:51.860 --> 02:11:54.950
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't give it testosterone and</v>
<v Speaker 1>continue receiving impacts.</v>

2980
02:11:55.100 --> 02:11:57.380
<v Speaker 1>That was the whole premise for him</v>
<v Speaker 1>coming on the show in the first place.</v>

2981
02:11:57.381 --> 02:11:59.690
<v Speaker 1>So for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt like I,</v>

2982
02:11:59.691 --> 02:12:02.390
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's the smartest person I know in</v>

2983
02:12:02.391 --> 02:12:06.470
<v Speaker 1>regards to this particular subject.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I felt it was kind of important to</v>

2984
02:12:06.471 --> 02:12:08.840
<v Speaker 1>discuss it with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea that's glutathione shit</v>

2985
02:12:08.841 --> 02:12:10.190
<v Speaker 1>was going to come up with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but here's what he said.</v>

2986
02:12:10.191 --> 02:12:12.140
<v Speaker 1>We're going to pick up after you drink</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you take them.</v>

2987
02:12:12.720 --> 02:12:14.100
<v Speaker 5>What is the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what is it?</v>

2988
02:12:14.220 --> 02:12:17.850
<v Speaker 5>Unbelievable gludethyon pull that thing</v>
<v Speaker 5>closer to your face so people hear you</v>

2989
02:12:17.851 --> 02:12:19.230
<v Speaker 5>better.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Glutathione,</v>

2990
02:12:19.231 --> 02:12:23.190
<v Speaker 5>glutathione and that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That helps your liver when you drink</v>

2991
02:12:23.191 --> 02:12:24.030
<v Speaker 5>alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2992
02:12:24.060 --> 02:12:28.260
<v Speaker 5>it helps you with just about anything</v>
<v Speaker 5>that delivers responsible for I'm</v>

2993
02:12:29.070 --> 02:12:34.070
<v Speaker 5>digesting or metabolizing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>As you metabolize certain drugs,</v>

2994
02:12:35.041 --> 02:12:38.670
<v Speaker 5>chemicals and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The liver uses up its ability to</v>

2995
02:12:39.270 --> 02:12:42.580
<v Speaker 5>continue the process so it spills over</v>
<v Speaker 5>into the blood and that's how you get a,</v>

2996
02:12:42.620 --> 02:12:45.330
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>drunk because your liver can only deal</v>

2997
02:12:45.331 --> 02:12:47.970
<v Speaker 5>with a certain amount,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so if you replenish or replace the</v>

2998
02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:51.240
<v Speaker 5>glutathione in the liver,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you get an incredible benefits of it.</v>

2999
02:12:51.630 --> 02:12:55.590
<v Speaker 5>Not only does it help with metabolism,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's an incredible antioxidant for</v>

3000
02:12:55.591 --> 02:12:57.450
<v Speaker 5>the brain and for the eyes and for the</v>
<v Speaker 5>heart.</v>

3001
02:12:57.930 --> 02:13:00.660
<v Speaker 5>What is it made out of a.</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's three amino acids that are</v>

3002
02:13:00.661 --> 02:13:02.010
<v Speaker 5>together.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's in our body,</v>

3003
02:13:02.011 --> 02:13:06.790
<v Speaker 5>but we don't have enough of it to really</v>
<v Speaker 5>generate the metabolism that we needed</v>

3004
02:13:06.810 --> 02:13:08.850
<v Speaker 5>for drinking and where do they get that?</v>

3005
02:13:08.850 --> 02:13:11.340
<v Speaker 5>Where do they get glutathione,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because I know Dave asprey's really into</v>

3006
02:13:11.341 --> 02:13:14.190
<v Speaker 5>that stuff too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Version of it's manufactured,</v>

3007
02:13:14.340 --> 02:13:17.190
<v Speaker 5>but how do they make it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What is a three amino acids that they</v>

3008
02:13:17.191 --> 02:13:22.110
<v Speaker 5>put together and the products that we</v>
<v Speaker 5>interact with?</v>

3009
02:13:22.140 --> 02:13:24.720
<v Speaker 5>Our HRA,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a delivery technology.</v>

3010
02:13:24.900 --> 02:13:29.900
<v Speaker 5>We're wrap the vitamins or you wrap the</v>
<v Speaker 5>supplement in a what's called a,</v>

3011
02:13:31.380 --> 02:13:36.380
<v Speaker 5>which is like a cell wall,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so from lecithin is from soy and it</v>

3012
02:13:36.511 --> 02:13:38.790
<v Speaker 5>protects whatever it is that you're</v>
<v Speaker 5>ingesting.</v>

3013
02:13:39.150 --> 02:13:41.760
<v Speaker 5>A lot of the things that you take,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like I think I shared with you,</v>

3014
02:13:42.120 --> 02:13:44.940
<v Speaker 5>if you take a thousand milligrams of</v>
<v Speaker 5>vitamin C by mouth,</v>

3015
02:13:44.970 --> 02:13:48.390
<v Speaker 5>you only absorb 19 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The rest of it is destroyed by the acid</v>

3016
02:13:48.570 --> 02:13:51.360
<v Speaker 5>in the stomach,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but if you wrap it in this protection</v>

3017
02:13:51.361 --> 02:13:55.470
<v Speaker 5>called the light bulbs home,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you'll be able to absorb 93 percent.</v>

3018
02:13:55.770 --> 02:13:59.450
<v Speaker 5>So taking something like Glutathione,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which normally when you take it in in</v>

3019
02:13:59.460 --> 02:14:02.010
<v Speaker 5>its natural form,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's destroyed.</v>

3020
02:14:02.040 --> 02:14:03.790
<v Speaker 5>Most of it is destroyed and then</v>
<v Speaker 5>absorbed,</v>

3021
02:14:03.830 --> 02:14:07.830
<v Speaker 5>then remanufactured in the blood,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but if you wrap it in this protective</v>

3022
02:14:07.831 --> 02:14:09.150
<v Speaker 5>outer coating,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a Lyposomal,</v>

3023
02:14:09.360 --> 02:14:12.900
<v Speaker 5>you can absorb it more readily and their</v>
<v Speaker 5>effects are unbelievably positive.</v>

3024
02:14:13.080 --> 02:14:17.280
<v Speaker 5>For instance,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a gentleman who went out drinking three</v>

3025
02:14:17.281 --> 02:14:21.150
<v Speaker 5>high balls and five shots of Tequila</v>
<v Speaker 5>went home and subsequently was very</v>

3026
02:14:21.151 --> 02:14:22.170
<v Speaker 5>dizzy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>nauseous.</v>

3027
02:14:22.650 --> 02:14:27.480
<v Speaker 5>He forgot that I gave them a sample of a</v>
<v Speaker 5>this glutathione and he's used four</v>

3028
02:14:27.481 --> 02:14:30.360
<v Speaker 5>puffs under the tongue,</v>
<v Speaker 5>held it for 30 seconds,</v>

3029
02:14:30.361 --> 02:14:33.330
<v Speaker 5>and then 30 minutes later,</v>
<v Speaker 5>clear Isabelle woke up the next day,</v>

3030
02:14:33.331 --> 02:14:35.010
<v Speaker 5>went out partying again.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Couldn't get drunk.</v>

3031
02:14:35.130 --> 02:14:38.610
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That sounds like nonsense.</v>

3032
02:14:38.870 --> 02:14:39.630
<v Speaker 5>It isn't.</v>

3033
02:14:39.630 --> 02:14:41.370
<v Speaker 2>So I was smart enough to call you on</v>
<v Speaker 2>your bullshit.</v>

3034
02:14:42.350 --> 02:14:44.010
<v Speaker 2>Talk to my office,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Aaron.</v>

3035
02:14:44.020 --> 02:14:46.230
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything sounds crazy.</v>

3036
02:14:46.231 --> 02:14:47.520
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that guy will cut her off right</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

3037
02:14:47.521 --> 02:14:49.500
<v Speaker 2>Maybe when I was actually at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>beginning of the podcast,</v>

3038
02:14:49.510 --> 02:14:51.780
<v Speaker 2>I remember that was about where I got</v>
<v Speaker 2>mad and that was right in.</v>

3039
02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:53.580
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't buy the.</v>

3040
02:14:53.581 --> 02:14:55.020
<v Speaker 2>He says he couldn't get drunk the next</v>
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>

3041
02:14:55.021 --> 02:14:57.750
<v Speaker 2>That's very anecdotal though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what he was saying was just hard</v>

3042
02:14:57.751 --> 02:15:00.570
<v Speaker 2>science.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What a good doctor is not going to go</v>

3043
02:15:00.571 --> 02:15:04.290
<v Speaker 2>and tell people anecdotes like you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>take this product and not get drunk.</v>

3044
02:15:04.440 --> 02:15:06.330
<v Speaker 2>I agree,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and maybe he was nervous being on a</v>

3045
02:15:06.331 --> 02:15:07.680
<v Speaker 2>podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You probably shouldn't have said it.</v>

3046
02:15:07.681 --> 02:15:08.700
<v Speaker 2>No Man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a million people.</v>

3047
02:15:08.701 --> 02:15:10.560
<v Speaker 2>Plus they're going to listen to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>

3048
02:15:10.740 --> 02:15:14.400
<v Speaker 2>what he said was all hard science.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What he said was,</v>

3049
02:15:15.300 --> 02:15:18.570
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here are the things he said that led me</v>

3050
02:15:18.571 --> 02:15:22.460
<v Speaker 2>to believe that it was his product at</v>
<v Speaker 2>least obviously here where you would</v>

3051
02:15:22.470 --> 02:15:22.740
<v Speaker 2>watch it.</v>

3052
02:15:22.740 --> 02:15:23.670
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't as product.</v>

3053
02:15:23.671 --> 02:15:24.600
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't selling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

3054
02:15:24.630 --> 02:15:26.430
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I gave him the supplement and you said,</v>

3055
02:15:26.431 --> 02:15:28.290
<v Speaker 2>here's the delivery thing that we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>working on,</v>

3056
02:15:28.291 --> 02:15:30.660
<v Speaker 2>so maybe I misinterpreted that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me tell you something about this</v>

3057
02:15:30.661 --> 02:15:32.310
<v Speaker 2>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a very generous guy and he gives</v>

3058
02:15:32.311 --> 02:15:33.690
<v Speaker 2>people the vitamins all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

3059
02:15:33.691 --> 02:15:34.650
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>try this out.</v>

3060
02:15:34.890 --> 02:15:37.900
<v Speaker 2>This has been taken.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is an incredible amino acid.</v>

3061
02:15:37.901 --> 02:15:40.740
<v Speaker 2>It's Baba Baba grapeseed and he's just</v>
<v Speaker 2>a.</v>

3062
02:15:41.370 --> 02:15:42.900
<v Speaker 2>He gives things out to people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

3063
02:15:43.050 --> 02:15:44.280
<v Speaker 2>here's the he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he.</v>

3064
02:15:44.310 --> 02:15:47.130
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has all of these amazing effects in</v>

3065
02:15:47.190 --> 02:15:48.480
<v Speaker 2>your heart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your brain,</v>

3066
02:15:48.481 --> 02:15:50.070
<v Speaker 2>your eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>antioxidants,</v>

3067
02:15:50.100 --> 02:15:54.660
<v Speaker 2>and he's using language like</v>
<v Speaker 2>extraordinary and amazing and in my</v>

3068
02:15:54.661 --> 02:15:56.820
<v Speaker 2>experience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my experience,</v>

3069
02:15:56.821 --> 02:16:00.930
<v Speaker 2>dealing with many quacks of many</v>
<v Speaker 2>different duck species.</v>

3070
02:16:01.410 --> 02:16:04.860
<v Speaker 2>If it looks on quacks like when it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>usually a quack and he was using very</v>

3071
02:16:04.861 --> 02:16:07.700
<v Speaker 2>quack like language and making very</v>
<v Speaker 2>quick points.</v>

3072
02:16:07.770 --> 02:16:11.010
<v Speaker 2>I don't know anybody accused,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could accuse him of hyperbole,</v>

3073
02:16:11.011 --> 02:16:14.340
<v Speaker 2>but what he's saying is essentially hard</v>
<v Speaker 2>science about the Lyposomal,</v>

3074
02:16:14.580 --> 02:16:19.580
<v Speaker 2>the digesting of nutrients using the</v>
<v Speaker 2>lyposomal method as opposed to just</v>

3075
02:16:19.740 --> 02:16:21.720
<v Speaker 2>normally being broken down by stomach</v>
<v Speaker 2>acids.</v>

3076
02:16:21.930 --> 02:16:23.730
<v Speaker 2>All the things he's saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not that ridiculous.</v>

3077
02:16:23.731 --> 02:16:24.001
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3078
02:16:24.001 --> 02:16:26.160
<v Speaker 2>when you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you usually take something,</v>

3079
02:16:26.600 --> 02:16:28.560
<v Speaker 2>if I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you take some kind of an enzyme or</v>

3080
02:16:28.561 --> 02:16:29.650
<v Speaker 2>something in your mouth,</v>

3081
02:16:30.040 --> 02:16:32.950
<v Speaker 1>your saliva is going to start breaking</v>
<v Speaker 1>it down into their constituent amino</v>

3082
02:16:32.951 --> 02:16:36.490
<v Speaker 1>acids right away and you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's what he said was right.</v>

3083
02:16:36.491 --> 02:16:39.790
<v Speaker 1>It's not going to get used as</v>
<v Speaker 1>glutathione in your body.</v>

3084
02:16:39.850 --> 02:16:42.760
<v Speaker 1>Those amino acids are going to go their</v>
<v Speaker 1>separate ways and become used for</v>

3085
02:16:42.761 --> 02:16:45.100
<v Speaker 1>whatever else your body actually is</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking for.</v>

3086
02:16:45.101 --> 02:16:47.860
<v Speaker 1>At the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know about his particular</v>

3087
02:16:47.861 --> 02:16:50.790
<v Speaker 1>delivery method that he's talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when he says it's not his</v>

3088
02:16:51.860 --> 02:16:53.290
<v Speaker 1>guaranteed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know about this stuff,</v>

3089
02:16:53.320 --> 02:16:55.540
<v Speaker 1>the particular delivery method he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about,</v>

3090
02:16:55.541 --> 02:16:58.210
<v Speaker 1>but when he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can take a thousand milligrams of</v>

3091
02:16:58.211 --> 02:17:00.880
<v Speaker 1>vitamin C and your body's going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>absorb 93 percent of it,</v>

3092
02:17:01.240 --> 02:17:06.240
<v Speaker 1>that's in my experience medically</v>
<v Speaker 1>nonsensical and your body doesn't need</v>

3093
02:17:06.460 --> 02:17:09.370
<v Speaker 1>that much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Will your body doesn't use that 93</v>

3094
02:17:09.371 --> 02:17:11.830
<v Speaker 1>percent of what though?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are the vitamin C you took in your</v>

3095
02:17:12.020 --> 02:17:14.710
<v Speaker 1>thousand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what if it's a small amount?</v>

3096
02:17:14.890 --> 02:17:17.430
<v Speaker 1>If he's saying that your body absorbs 93</v>
<v Speaker 1>percent of vitamin C's,</v>

3097
02:17:17.440 --> 02:17:20.170
<v Speaker 1>not saying that you need a thousand</v>
<v Speaker 1>milligrams in your body absorbs 93</v>

3098
02:17:20.171 --> 02:17:22.330
<v Speaker 1>percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What he's saying that if you deliver it</v>

3099
02:17:22.331 --> 02:17:26.380
<v Speaker 1>in a lyposomal form,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get a 93 percent bioavailability.</v>

3100
02:17:26.560 --> 02:17:29.260
<v Speaker 1>He's not giving a specific number that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should take.</v>

3101
02:17:29.500 --> 02:17:31.570
<v Speaker 1>He was saying that if you take vitamin</v>
<v Speaker 1>C,</v>

3102
02:17:31.600 --> 02:17:35.160
<v Speaker 1>most of it gets destroyed unless you use</v>
<v Speaker 1>it Lyposomal,</v>

3103
02:17:35.310 --> 02:17:38.920
<v Speaker 1>which I think is correct,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but your body doesn't have any use for</v>

3104
02:17:38.921 --> 02:17:41.270
<v Speaker 1>93 percent of a thousand milligrams of</v>
<v Speaker 1>vitamin C.</v>

3105
02:17:41.940 --> 02:17:44.950
<v Speaker 1>He didn't say that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't say you need a thousand</v>

3106
02:17:44.950 --> 02:17:46.690
<v Speaker 1>milligrams and then 93 percent of it is</v>
<v Speaker 1>absorbed.</v>

3107
02:17:46.691 --> 02:17:48.700
<v Speaker 1>What he said is if you take it light but</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somali,</v>

3108
02:17:48.940 --> 02:17:52.600
<v Speaker 1>it's a higher rate of vial availability</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's up to 93 percent.</v>

3109
02:17:52.810 --> 02:17:54.790
<v Speaker 1>He didn't say you have to take 100</v>
<v Speaker 1>milligrams.</v>

3110
02:17:55.170 --> 02:17:57.950
<v Speaker 1>Do you think she was implying that it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>better to have a dosage?</v>

3111
02:17:57.950 --> 02:18:00.880
<v Speaker 1>She was trying to say that it's better</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have lyposomal vitamin C because it's</v>

3112
02:18:00.881 --> 02:18:02.980
<v Speaker 1>more bioavailable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all hard sciences.</v>

3113
02:18:02.981 --> 02:18:05.380
<v Speaker 1>I was a better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's going to give you more than you</v>

3114
02:18:05.381 --> 02:18:06.430
<v Speaker 1>can use,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how is it better?</v>

3115
02:18:06.640 --> 02:18:07.780
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're adding that.</v>

3116
02:18:07.810 --> 02:18:10.300
<v Speaker 1>He didn't say that you have to have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>thousand milligrams.</v>

3117
02:18:10.510 --> 02:18:13.780
<v Speaker 1>What he said is that if you take it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>19 percent is going to get absorbed.</v>

3118
02:18:13.781 --> 02:18:15.070
<v Speaker 1>You'd take it through the traditional</v>
<v Speaker 1>method.</v>

3119
02:18:15.071 --> 02:18:16.390
<v Speaker 1>If you take it light,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so molly,</v>

3120
02:18:16.630 --> 02:18:19.610
<v Speaker 1>then you get 93 percent absorption.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't give you a dose it.</v>

3121
02:18:19.630 --> 02:18:23.320
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't saying he wasn't suggesting or</v>
<v Speaker 1>implying that that's them to be wrong.</v>

3122
02:18:23.360 --> 02:18:24.330
<v Speaker 1>Siren.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is not.</v>

3123
02:18:24.331 --> 02:18:25.360
<v Speaker 1>This is not cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

3124
02:18:25.361 --> 02:18:27.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying it looks and quacks like</v>

3125
02:18:27.701 --> 02:18:29.800
<v Speaker 1>a duck generous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you're saying is disingenuous</v>

3126
02:18:29.801 --> 02:18:32.260
<v Speaker 1>because that's not what he's saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What what he's saying there was that the</v>

3127
02:18:32.290 --> 02:18:36.370
<v Speaker 1>bioavailability of lipel symbol</v>
<v Speaker 1>nutrients is better and that's true.</v>

3128
02:18:36.750 --> 02:18:39.180
<v Speaker 1>You're saying that he's saying a</v>
<v Speaker 1>thousand milligrams in Europe.</v>

3129
02:18:39.181 --> 02:18:41.080
<v Speaker 1>Point of contention is you don't need a</v>
<v Speaker 1>thousand milligrams.</v>

3130
02:18:41.200 --> 02:18:44.680
<v Speaker 1>He never said you need a thousand</v>
<v Speaker 1>milligrams of Lyposomal vitamin C.</v>

3131
02:18:44.890 --> 02:18:48.000
<v Speaker 1>all he said was that when you take</v>
<v Speaker 1>vitamin C,</v>

3132
02:18:48.030 --> 02:18:50.050
<v Speaker 1>lipel stumbling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your body absorbs it better.</v>

3133
02:18:50.500 --> 02:18:52.780
<v Speaker 1>Whether it says what it's really 93</v>
<v Speaker 1>percent.</v>

3134
02:18:53.200 --> 02:18:53.861
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3135
02:18:53.861 --> 02:18:54.700
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at this.</v>

3136
02:18:54.910 --> 02:18:59.910
<v Speaker 1>Fuck they're saying on a live and labs</v>
<v Speaker 1>lyposomal science.</v>

3137
02:19:00.720 --> 02:19:05.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying a bioavailability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a vial of bioavailability of 98 percent.</v>

3138
02:19:05.860 --> 02:19:08.500
<v Speaker 1>There's another one that says over 90</v>
<v Speaker 1>percent.</v>

3139
02:19:08.740 --> 02:19:12.010
<v Speaker 1>So what he's saying is true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What he's saying is fact,</v>

3140
02:19:12.070 --> 02:19:13.630
<v Speaker 1>and you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're shitting on it because you don't</v>

3141
02:19:13.631 --> 02:19:17.050
<v Speaker 1>want them to be right about what I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're correct about is this,</v>

3142
02:19:17.051 --> 02:19:19.900
<v Speaker 1>this idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this anecdotal story of a guy,</v>

3143
02:19:20.140 --> 02:19:21.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking this stuff,</v>

3144
02:19:21.251 --> 02:19:23.920
<v Speaker 1>feeling better 30 minutes later and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>the next day couldn't get drunk.</v>

3145
02:19:23.950 --> 02:19:27.070
<v Speaker 1>That sounds like bullshit to me too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but all that other stuff that he said,</v>

3146
02:19:27.650 --> 02:19:28.610
<v Speaker 1>that's all science.</v>

3147
02:19:29.500 --> 02:19:33.400
<v Speaker 4>I'm shitting on anyone who is selling</v>
<v Speaker 4>snake oil.</v>

3148
02:19:33.430 --> 02:19:37.780
<v Speaker 4>Basically come on pitching snake oil to</v>
<v Speaker 4>be bought or suggesting that that buying</v>

3149
02:19:37.781 --> 02:19:41.650
<v Speaker 4>supplements and things that you don't</v>
<v Speaker 4>need is a good way to spend your money.</v>

3150
02:19:41.700 --> 02:19:44.160
<v Speaker 1>But wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If someone likes to drink isn't a smart</v>

3151
02:19:44.161 --> 02:19:47.370
<v Speaker 1>thing to take glutathione after you</v>
<v Speaker 1>drank to to shorten your hangover.</v>

3152
02:19:47.520 --> 02:19:48.360
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that effective?</v>

3153
02:19:49.360 --> 02:19:51.810
<v Speaker 4>I would have to look at the research</v>
<v Speaker 4>before I would tell you</v>

3154
02:19:51.940 --> 02:19:54.160
<v Speaker 1>you said it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You said it before you said that it.</v>

3155
02:19:54.180 --> 02:19:57.790
<v Speaker 1>It aids in reducing hangover.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3156
02:19:57.791 --> 02:19:58.624
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it.</v>

3157
02:19:58.960 --> 02:20:02.230
<v Speaker 1>So why wouldn't you take that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're saying that he's selling</v>

3158
02:20:02.231 --> 02:20:05.650
<v Speaker 1>something that you don't need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not as simple as that,</v>

3159
02:20:05.770 --> 02:20:06.371
<v Speaker 1>but wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wait.</v>

3160
02:20:06.371 --> 02:20:09.370
<v Speaker 1>None of these issues are as simple as</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying it is,</v>

3161
02:20:09.371 --> 02:20:09.811
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

3162
02:20:09.811 --> 02:20:14.350
<v Speaker 1>you're saying that you take glutathione</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're hung over and it reduces the</v>

3163
02:20:14.351 --> 02:20:16.270
<v Speaker 1>length of your hangover.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He saying,</v>

3164
02:20:16.330 --> 02:20:19.560
<v Speaker 1>take glutathione.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're saying saying to take glutathione</v>

3165
02:20:19.570 --> 02:20:21.910
<v Speaker 1>is unnecessarily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're saying that you don't need it</v>

3166
02:20:22.090 --> 02:20:23.440
<v Speaker 1>when needed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't need nutrients.</v>

3167
02:20:23.590 --> 02:20:26.620
<v Speaker 1>You could live on cheeseburgers and get</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be fucking 60 years old.</v>

3168
02:20:26.621 --> 02:20:30.160
<v Speaker 1>Just eating shitty food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't mean it doesn't mean your</v>

3169
02:20:30.161 --> 02:20:33.850
<v Speaker 1>life isn't enhanced by raw vegetables</v>
<v Speaker 1>and nutrients and having a balanced</v>

3170
02:20:33.851 --> 02:20:34.780
<v Speaker 1>diet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

3171
02:20:34.820 --> 02:20:38.140
<v Speaker 1>you saying that you don't need</v>
<v Speaker 1>glutathione is pretty ridiculous.</v>

3172
02:20:38.230 --> 02:20:40.870
<v Speaker 4>If you can get glutathione into your</v>
<v Speaker 4>liver,</v>

3173
02:20:40.871 --> 02:20:43.540
<v Speaker 4>you will,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your hangover will be reduced.</v>

3174
02:20:43.541 --> 02:20:47.680
<v Speaker 4>So why don't you either.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This method of taking a supplement will</v>

3175
02:20:47.681 --> 02:20:50.980
<v Speaker 4>get glutathione into your liver is</v>
<v Speaker 4>something that I don't know and I would</v>

3176
02:20:50.981 --> 02:20:53.300
<v Speaker 4>have to look at the research before I</v>
<v Speaker 4>would tell you that you're already in.</v>

3177
02:20:53.301 --> 02:20:55.710
<v Speaker 4>I will tell you being wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

3178
02:20:55.750 --> 02:20:59.830
<v Speaker 4>I'm accusing him being wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you can take a product and not get</v>

3179
02:20:59.831 --> 02:21:03.640
<v Speaker 4>drunk after trying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to get drunk and not able to get</v>

3180
02:21:03.641 --> 02:21:05.560
<v Speaker 4>drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm saying that that's wrong and it</v>

3181
02:21:05.561 --> 02:21:08.430
<v Speaker 4>borders on being really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really unethical.</v>

3182
02:21:08.431 --> 02:21:08.810
<v Speaker 4>He wrong.</v>

3183
02:21:08.810 --> 02:21:11.420
<v Speaker 1>We agree on that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you've set up all sorts of Straw man</v>

3184
02:21:11.421 --> 02:21:15.050
<v Speaker 1>arguments for why he did it and what</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's doing and what he's saying and the</v>

3185
02:21:15.260 --> 02:21:18.590
<v Speaker 1>bioavailability of vitamin C in those</v>
<v Speaker 1>all fall under the fall apart under</v>

3186
02:21:18.591 --> 02:21:20.390
<v Speaker 1>scrutiny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's have him come on and correct it</v>

3187
02:21:20.400 --> 02:21:23.940
<v Speaker 1>this time to come on and debate you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't know you wouldn't get it.</v>

3188
02:21:24.350 --> 02:21:26.130
<v Speaker 1>I'd get I'd get someone who knows the</v>
<v Speaker 1>business.</v>

3189
02:21:26.430 --> 02:21:26.900
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

3190
02:21:26.900 --> 02:21:30.440
<v Speaker 1>he's a silly guy and sometimes he might</v>
<v Speaker 1>speak in hyperbole,</v>

3191
02:21:30.441 --> 02:21:35.441
<v Speaker 1>but what he's saying that you corrected</v>
<v Speaker 1>your wrong about about bio availability.</v>

3192
02:21:35.780 --> 02:21:39.590
<v Speaker 1>You attributed him to this erroneous</v>
<v Speaker 1>number of a thousand milligrams.</v>

3193
02:21:39.591 --> 02:21:40.970
<v Speaker 1>He didn't say that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did not.</v>

3194
02:21:40.971 --> 02:21:42.680
<v Speaker 1>Did you want to play?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's play it again.</v>

3195
02:21:42.920 --> 02:21:43.940
<v Speaker 1>Let's play again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The light bulbs,</v>

3196
02:21:43.990 --> 02:21:45.460
<v Speaker 1>Samo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't need to play.</v>

3197
02:21:46.130 --> 02:21:49.670
<v Speaker 4>If you take a thousand milligrams of</v>
<v Speaker 4>vitamin C and ut and a and you take it</v>

3198
02:21:49.671 --> 02:21:51.350
<v Speaker 4>Lyposomal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'll absorb 93</v>

3199
02:21:51.410 --> 02:21:54.320
<v Speaker 1>and it's not what he said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What he said was,</v>

3200
02:21:54.321 --> 02:21:56.300
<v Speaker 1>if you take a thousand milligrams of</v>
<v Speaker 1>vitamin C,</v>

3201
02:21:56.301 --> 02:21:59.000
<v Speaker 1>your body only absorbs 19 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he said,</v>

3202
02:21:59.001 --> 02:22:00.980
<v Speaker 1>if you take vitamin C,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lipids Soumala,</v>

3203
02:22:01.010 --> 02:22:05.390
<v Speaker 1>your body absorbs a giant amount of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said 19 percent and 93 percent.</v>

3204
02:22:05.750 --> 02:22:06.830
<v Speaker 1>That's what he said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't say,</v>

3205
02:22:06.880 --> 02:22:10.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're saying you don't need that much</v>

3206
02:22:10.311 --> 02:22:13.520
<v Speaker 1>vitamin C and that's why he's wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but high levels of vitamin C,</v>

3207
02:22:13.521 --> 02:22:16.790
<v Speaker 1>that's debatable as well because high</v>
<v Speaker 1>levels of vitamin C have been shown to</v>

3208
02:22:16.791 --> 02:22:19.640
<v Speaker 1>be potent antioxidants that could</v>
<v Speaker 1>prevent against certain types of</v>

3209
02:22:19.641 --> 02:22:21.620
<v Speaker 1>diseases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people think it boosts your</v>

3210
02:22:21.621 --> 02:22:24.680
<v Speaker 1>immune system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It helps fight off various pathogens.</v>

3211
02:22:24.681 --> 02:22:28.650
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of research hard data that</v>
<v Speaker 1>shows that high levels of vitamin C is</v>

3212
02:22:28.651 --> 02:22:29.760
<v Speaker 1>probably pretty good for you.</v>

3213
02:22:29.800 --> 02:22:31.750
<v Speaker 4>In my research,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all of that has turned out to be</v>

3214
02:22:31.751 --> 02:22:34.660
<v Speaker 4>nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your research on vitamin C is extensive?</v>

3215
02:22:34.780 --> 02:22:36.880
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's your research on vitamin C?</v>

3216
02:22:36.910 --> 02:22:38.770
<v Speaker 4>God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can look up my episode for you.</v>

3217
02:22:38.771 --> 02:22:40.090
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was a few years ago.</v>

3218
02:22:40.150 --> 02:22:43.510
<v Speaker 4>We talked mostly about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was invented by a course linus</v>

3219
02:22:43.511 --> 02:22:46.300
<v Speaker 4>pauling,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who by this time in his career was</v>

3220
02:22:46.360 --> 02:22:51.220
<v Speaker 4>something of a crank and came up with</v>
<v Speaker 4>this notion that vitamin,</v>

3221
02:22:51.221 --> 02:22:55.480
<v Speaker 4>Mega dosing would cure cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he wrote the book called</v>

3222
02:22:58.810 --> 02:23:01.750
<v Speaker 4>can't remember the name of his book,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's essentially what started off</v>

3223
02:23:01.751 --> 02:23:05.050
<v Speaker 4>the whole vitamin and supplement</v>
<v Speaker 4>movement that still exists very strongly</v>

3224
02:23:05.051 --> 02:23:09.310
<v Speaker 4>to this day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And what we have found by testing is</v>

3225
02:23:09.311 --> 02:23:12.550
<v Speaker 4>that vitamin C does not significantly</v>
<v Speaker 4>affect cancer.</v>

3226
02:23:12.551 --> 02:23:14.590
<v Speaker 4>The length or duration or severity of a</v>
<v Speaker 4>cold,</v>

3227
02:23:14.620 --> 02:23:17.020
<v Speaker 4>etc. Etc.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All of thEse things that we take it for,</v>

3228
02:23:18.670 --> 02:23:23.230
<v Speaker 4>this caused a great rift between him and</v>
<v Speaker 4>science and he spent most of the rest of</v>

3229
02:23:23.231 --> 02:23:25.810
<v Speaker 4>his career,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which was fairly short because he was</v>

3230
02:23:25.811 --> 02:23:27.770
<v Speaker 4>quite elderly by that time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

3231
02:23:27.820 --> 02:23:30.460
<v Speaker 4>basically widening that rift and</v>
<v Speaker 4>debating with,</v>

3232
02:23:30.461 --> 02:23:32.410
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with the medical profession and trying</v>

3233
02:23:32.411 --> 02:23:37.150
<v Speaker 4>to defend his vitamin mega dosing idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And what you'll find now,</v>

3234
02:23:37.151 --> 02:23:40.780
<v Speaker 4>I mean this is pretty much everywhere in</v>
<v Speaker 4>recent scientific literature,</v>

3235
02:23:40.781 --> 02:23:45.070
<v Speaker 4>is the idea that vitamins really don't</v>
<v Speaker 4>do anything for you because very few</v>

3236
02:23:45.071 --> 02:23:48.160
<v Speaker 4>people have vitamin deficiencies and you</v>
<v Speaker 4>still have health</v>

3237
02:23:48.700 --> 02:23:50.430
<v Speaker 1>list evidence demonstrating that vitamin</v>
<v Speaker 1>c's,</v>

3238
02:23:50.431 --> 02:23:54.660
<v Speaker 1>anticancer properties that high levels</v>
<v Speaker 1>of vitamin c kills cancer.</v>

3239
02:23:54.930 --> 02:23:56.640
<v Speaker 1>This is the national institute of health</v>

3240
02:23:57.060 --> 02:23:59.530
<v Speaker 4>and read the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I bet you anything that's talked about</v>

3241
02:23:59.531 --> 02:24:03.290
<v Speaker 4>in vitro,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in vitro or ivy you mean?</v>

3242
02:24:03.450 --> 02:24:07.060
<v Speaker 4>You mean in vitro means if you put</v>
<v Speaker 4>something in a petri dish and you put</v>

3243
02:24:07.061 --> 02:24:10.000
<v Speaker 4>some cells in there and you pour</v>
<v Speaker 4>something in it and it kills the cells</v>

3244
02:24:10.220 --> 02:24:12.910
<v Speaker 4>that's in vitro.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's got very little to do with</v>

3245
02:24:13.240 --> 02:24:16.180
<v Speaker 4>institute,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which has means actually doing some</v>

3246
02:24:16.181 --> 02:24:17.470
<v Speaker 4>tests in your body.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

3247
02:24:17.590 --> 02:24:19.600
<v Speaker 1>the ivc,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that what they would call it?</v>

3248
02:24:20.140 --> 02:24:22.150
<v Speaker 1>High dose ivc.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that in vitro?</v>

3249
02:24:22.260 --> 02:24:24.780
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it would just be written out in vitro.</v>

3250
02:24:25.140 --> 02:24:26.910
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not saying that saying high dose</v>

3251
02:24:26.911 --> 02:24:30.120
<v Speaker 1>ivc,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a nontoxic chemotherapeutic agent that</v>

3252
02:24:30.121 --> 02:24:33.720
<v Speaker 1>can be given in conjunction with</v>
<v Speaker 1>conventional cancer treatments based on</v>

3253
02:24:33.721 --> 02:24:37.230
<v Speaker 1>the work of several vitamin c pioneers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Before Dr. Jordan was able to prove that</v>

3254
02:24:37.231 --> 02:24:39.630
<v Speaker 1>vitamin c was selectively toxic to</v>
<v Speaker 1>cancer cells,</v>

3255
02:24:39.780 --> 02:24:44.190
<v Speaker 1>if given intravenously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This research has recently reproduced</v>

3256
02:24:44.191 --> 02:24:48.360
<v Speaker 1>and published by Dr. Mark Levine at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>national institute of health.</v>

3257
02:24:48.390 --> 02:24:52.980
<v Speaker 1>So meaning that it's the bioavailability</v>
<v Speaker 1>is at its highest because it's</v>

3258
02:24:52.981 --> 02:24:56.700
<v Speaker 1>intravenously introduced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning that what he was saying about</v>

3259
02:24:56.701 --> 02:24:59.850
<v Speaker 1>the bioavailability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bioavailability because of lyposomal</v>

3260
02:24:59.880 --> 02:25:02.790
<v Speaker 1>science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would also be a higher absorption</v>

3261
02:25:02.791 --> 02:25:06.840
<v Speaker 1>rate than eating it normally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what he's saying is that what this</v>

3262
02:25:06.930 --> 02:25:09.600
<v Speaker 1>article is saying is that there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>benefit to taking high level of vitamin</v>

3263
02:25:09.601 --> 02:25:10.434
<v Speaker 1>c.</v>

3264
02:25:11.330 --> 02:25:13.050
<v Speaker 4>I look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't have that article in front of</v>

3265
02:25:13.051 --> 02:25:14.700
<v Speaker 4>me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I will tell you in my experience</v>

3266
02:25:14.701 --> 02:25:18.540
<v Speaker 4>that you can find an article making any</v>
<v Speaker 4>point you want to very easily because</v>

3267
02:25:18.550 --> 02:25:21.150
<v Speaker 4>about anything and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but does having,</v>

3268
02:25:21.180 --> 02:25:24.460
<v Speaker 4>having researched this extensively and</v>
<v Speaker 4>being very familiar</v>

3269
02:25:24.460 --> 02:25:25.480
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3270
02:25:25.870 --> 02:25:29.680
<v Speaker 1>with science writers and science</v>
<v Speaker 1>journalist in virtually every field,</v>

3271
02:25:29.681 --> 02:25:34.681
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you that the current thinking</v>
<v Speaker 1>is not that vitamin c has any beneficial</v>

3272
02:25:38.171 --> 02:25:41.140
<v Speaker 1>effect on cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you are no idea what this article is</v>

3273
02:25:41.141 --> 02:25:43.510
<v Speaker 1>that you're looking at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's complicated,</v>

3274
02:25:43.511 --> 02:25:44.680
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3275
02:25:44.681 --> 02:25:47.530
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of work being done that</v>

3276
02:25:47.531 --> 02:25:49.780
<v Speaker 1>shows that there are benefits to taking</v>
<v Speaker 1>in nutrients.</v>

3277
02:25:49.781 --> 02:25:52.140
<v Speaker 1>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a study transfer,</v>

3278
02:25:52.970 --> 02:25:57.550
<v Speaker 1>the different various vitamins</v>
<v Speaker 1>supplementing various vitamins.</v>

3279
02:25:57.880 --> 02:25:58.990
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was uh,</v>

3280
02:25:59.050 --> 02:26:03.370
<v Speaker 1>an interesting one that I'm looking at</v>
<v Speaker 1>right now that we're talking about the,</v>

3281
02:26:03.371 --> 02:26:06.730
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the prevention of shit.</v>

3282
02:26:06.760 --> 02:26:09.580
<v Speaker 1>I'll try to find it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't see know those,</v>

3283
02:26:10.200 --> 02:26:11.010
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's one,</v>

3284
02:26:11.010 --> 02:26:13.450
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>infectious illness prevention and this</v>

3285
02:26:13.451 --> 02:26:15.940
<v Speaker 1>is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a ncbi website.</v>

3286
02:26:15.941 --> 02:26:18.160
<v Speaker 1>It's a national health institute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>national institute for health,</v>

3287
02:26:18.700 --> 02:26:23.140
<v Speaker 1>mood and stress cognition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they've shown that it's actually</v>

3288
02:26:23.141 --> 02:26:27.430
<v Speaker 1>that you could take high level that</v>
<v Speaker 1>vitamin c and different antioxidants and</v>

3289
02:26:27.431 --> 02:26:30.850
<v Speaker 1>multivitamins had been shown to decrease</v>
<v Speaker 1>juvenile delinquency.</v>

3290
02:26:32.050 --> 02:26:33.280
<v Speaker 1>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can find an article.</v>

3291
02:26:33.880 --> 02:26:34.930
<v Speaker 1>what did you search for it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way?</v>

3292
02:26:34.931 --> 02:26:36.490
<v Speaker 1>What was your search term?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember.</v>

3293
02:26:36.550 --> 02:26:41.530
<v Speaker 1>Benefits of vitamin c suck dick vitamins</v>
<v Speaker 1>through that all together.</v>

3294
02:26:42.280 --> 02:26:42.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

3295
02:26:42.910 --> 02:26:44.770
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see where you're going with all this</v>

3296
02:26:44.771 --> 02:26:48.020
<v Speaker 1>and I see your point of view.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a no nonsense guy and I,</v>

3297
02:26:48.021 --> 02:26:50.410
<v Speaker 1>I agree with you for the most part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that,</v>

3298
02:26:50.411 --> 02:26:51.420
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3299
02:26:51.460 --> 02:26:55.840
<v Speaker 1>in the case of Dr. Gordon and his</v>
<v Speaker 1>description was probably rather</v>

3300
02:26:55.841 --> 02:27:00.280
<v Speaker 1>unfortunate that he decided to give that</v>
<v Speaker 1>anecdotal story along with this very</v>

3301
02:27:00.281 --> 02:27:04.330
<v Speaker 1>interesting aspect of researching</v>
<v Speaker 1>nutrition fair assessment.</v>

3302
02:27:04.331 --> 02:27:04.740
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>

3303
02:27:04.740 --> 02:27:05.900
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll agree with that.</v>

3304
02:27:05.901 --> 02:27:08.110
<v Speaker 1>It's not a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would never make me angry enough to</v>

3305
02:27:08.170 --> 02:27:12.550
<v Speaker 1>shut it off and yell at them and your</v>
<v Speaker 1>descriptions of even what he said and</v>

3306
02:27:12.551 --> 02:27:14.050
<v Speaker 1>the event is off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3307
02:27:14.051 --> 02:27:17.020
<v Speaker 1>and I think that's from this hard</v>
<v Speaker 1>stance,</v>

3308
02:27:17.021 --> 02:27:18.370
<v Speaker 1>no nonsense approach you have.</v>

3309
02:27:18.370 --> 02:27:21.100
<v Speaker 1>And I don't blame you if you look in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world that we live in,</v>

3310
02:27:21.101 --> 02:27:24.700
<v Speaker 1>it's filled with bullshit and a no</v>
<v Speaker 1>nonsense guy gets fucking tired of</v>

3311
02:27:24.701 --> 02:27:28.780
<v Speaker 1>dealing with bullshit at a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a regular basis all day long.</v>

3312
02:27:29.080 --> 02:27:32.400
<v Speaker 1>And I think you're a bit knee jerk and</v>
<v Speaker 1>your reactions,</v>

3313
02:27:32.410 --> 02:27:33.290
<v Speaker 1>their fellow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

3314
02:27:33.630 --> 02:27:36.320
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're certainly not the only person to</v>

3315
02:27:36.321 --> 02:27:37.870
<v Speaker 1>have said that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3316
02:27:37.890 --> 02:27:40.630
<v Speaker 1>you used to believe that big foot five</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago may lighten up.</v>

3317
02:27:40.720 --> 02:27:45.720
<v Speaker 1>Here's the thing with the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the best definition of skepticism is the</v>

3318
02:27:45.971 --> 02:27:49.450
<v Speaker 1>intersection of science education and</v>
<v Speaker 1>consumer protection.</v>

3319
02:27:49.870 --> 02:27:52.420
<v Speaker 1>If people are have better science</v>
<v Speaker 1>literacy,</v>

3320
02:27:52.720 --> 02:27:57.640
<v Speaker 1>they are less likely to take advantage</v>
<v Speaker 1>of products that are worthless.</v>

3321
02:27:57.670 --> 02:28:00.160
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is a way of looking at it that it</v>

3322
02:28:00.161 --> 02:28:02.980
<v Speaker 1>aids in consumer protection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is my motivation.</v>

3323
02:28:02.981 --> 02:28:06.730
<v Speaker 1>I believe that information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it aids in consumer protection,</v>

3324
02:28:06.770 --> 02:28:08.860
<v Speaker 1>all the information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the eventually.</v>

3325
02:28:09.190 --> 02:28:11.800
<v Speaker 1>Right now we're dealing with this</v>
<v Speaker 1>rudimentary sort of a way of</v>

3326
02:28:12.110 --> 02:28:17.110
<v Speaker 1>assimilating it and distributing it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think ultimately all the bullshit that</v>

3327
02:28:17.531 --> 02:28:20.410
<v Speaker 1>we're dealing with in this world will</v>
<v Speaker 1>stop to to be valid.</v>

3328
02:28:20.680 --> 02:28:24.310
<v Speaker 1>I think what we're dealing with right</v>
<v Speaker 1>now is like we google things when they.</v>

3329
02:28:24.470 --> 02:28:27.740
<v Speaker 1>When we have an answer about something</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then one day we're going to have an</v>

3330
02:28:27.800 --> 02:28:32.800
<v Speaker 1>unstoppable like base of knowledge and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think that it's probably sooner than</v>

3331
02:28:33.921 --> 02:28:37.340
<v Speaker 1>later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but right now when we do have this,</v>

3332
02:28:37.370 --> 02:28:40.550
<v Speaker 1>these discrepancies and these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these issues,</v>

3333
02:28:40.910 --> 02:28:44.840
<v Speaker 1>any gray area,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anywhere that you're wrong and you take</v>

3334
02:28:44.841 --> 02:28:47.420
<v Speaker 1>this hard stance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this hard no nonsense stance,</v>

3335
02:28:47.660 --> 02:28:51.980
<v Speaker 1>it actually does more harm than it does</v>
<v Speaker 1>good because if we could show that</v>

3336
02:28:51.981 --> 02:28:55.730
<v Speaker 1>you're wrong than even though it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your message is correct.</v>

3337
02:28:56.000 --> 02:28:58.430
<v Speaker 1>I agree with your message has set it at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the time and he's my friend.</v>

3338
02:28:58.430 --> 02:28:59.810
<v Speaker 1>I wish I could call you out on your</v>
<v Speaker 1>bullshit.</v>

3339
02:29:00.140 --> 02:29:02.990
<v Speaker 1>I wished I could because I know him and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's kind of crazy,</v>

3340
02:29:03.410 --> 02:29:08.410
<v Speaker 1>but you saying all those things</v>
<v Speaker 1>diminishes your initial point because</v>

3341
02:29:08.961 --> 02:29:12.560
<v Speaker 1>your initial point was very valid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was being irresponsible in saying</v>

3342
02:29:12.590 --> 02:29:15.140
<v Speaker 1>that you could take this stuff and not</v>
<v Speaker 1>get drunk.</v>

3343
02:29:15.141 --> 02:29:18.430
<v Speaker 1>It seems ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He shouldn't have told that anecdote</v>

3344
02:29:18.431 --> 02:29:20.870
<v Speaker 1>story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you shouldn't have insisted that he</v>

3345
02:29:20.871 --> 02:29:24.950
<v Speaker 1>had said a thousand milligrams and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>is 93 percent bioavailability and then</v>

3346
02:29:24.951 --> 02:29:26.810
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to find some way that he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>

3347
02:29:26.811 --> 02:29:27.441
<v Speaker 1>So you're going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3348
02:29:27.441 --> 02:29:29.690
<v Speaker 1>why do you need that much?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he didn't say that.</v>

3349
02:29:29.691 --> 02:29:30.680
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's trying to sell this stuff.</v>

3350
02:29:30.681 --> 02:29:32.540
<v Speaker 1>He's not selling shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't have a store.</v>

3351
02:29:32.541 --> 02:29:34.190
<v Speaker 1>He's not selling a god damn thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

3352
02:29:34.430 --> 02:29:37.010
<v Speaker 1>we'll agree to disagree on whether he</v>
<v Speaker 1>said that,</v>

3353
02:29:37.150 --> 02:29:37.983
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we played,</v>

3354
02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:39.870
<v Speaker 1>we played it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we played it back and I heard.</v>

3355
02:29:39.871 --> 02:29:41.320
<v Speaker 1>But then again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you hear it again,</v>

3356
02:29:41.500 --> 02:29:46.430
<v Speaker 1>his thousand milligrams and you've given</v>
<v Speaker 1>me some great advice as far as a health</v>

3357
02:29:46.431 --> 02:29:48.580
<v Speaker 1>and fitness and exercise and all sorts</v>
<v Speaker 1>of kudos.</v>

3358
02:29:48.610 --> 02:29:49.670
<v Speaker 1>Gouda.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Had a couple of minutes.</v>

3359
02:29:50.570 --> 02:29:52.200
<v Speaker 1>The whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every conversation though.</v>

3360
02:29:52.240 --> 02:29:54.510
<v Speaker 1>I know I forgot something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know it's good ahead.</v>

3361
02:29:54.520 --> 02:29:57.600
<v Speaker 1>Tell them about him and shit helps your</v>
<v Speaker 1>liver after you drank and you this good</v>

3362
02:29:57.630 --> 02:29:58.463
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is this?</v>

3363
02:29:58.760 --> 02:29:59.960
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unbelievable.</v>

3364
02:29:59.990 --> 02:30:02.830
<v Speaker 1>Gludethyon no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he goes go a little bit of nuance</v>

3365
02:30:02.920 --> 02:30:03.770
<v Speaker 1>specifically</v>

3366
02:30:04.300 --> 02:30:09.300
<v Speaker 5>gludethyon and that would.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the products that we interact with</v>

3367
02:30:10.200 --> 02:30:12.760
<v Speaker 5>our,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a delivery technology,</v>

3368
02:30:12.850 --> 02:30:16.660
<v Speaker 5>we're um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you wrap the vitamins or you wrap the</v>

3369
02:30:16.661 --> 02:30:19.420
<v Speaker 5>supplement in a what's called a</v>
<v Speaker 5>liposome,</v>

3370
02:30:19.421 --> 02:30:24.421
<v Speaker 5>which is like a cell wall.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So from lecithin is from soy and it</v>

3371
02:30:24.551 --> 02:30:26.810
<v Speaker 5>protects whatever it is that you're</v>
<v Speaker 5>ingesting.</v>

3372
02:30:27.150 --> 02:30:29.800
<v Speaker 5>A lot of the things that you take,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like I think I shared with you,</v>

3373
02:30:30.160 --> 02:30:32.980
<v Speaker 5>if you take a thousand milligrams of</v>
<v Speaker 5>vitamin c by mouth,</v>

3374
02:30:33.010 --> 02:30:36.400
<v Speaker 5>you only absorb 19 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The rest of it is destroyed by the acid</v>

3375
02:30:36.401 --> 02:30:39.370
<v Speaker 5>that's in the stomach.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But if you wrap it in this protection</v>

3376
02:30:39.371 --> 02:30:43.480
<v Speaker 5>called the lyposomal,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you'll be able to absorb 93 percent.</v>

3377
02:30:43.810 --> 02:30:46.140
<v Speaker 5>So taking something like glutathione,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which</v>

3378
02:30:46.380 --> 02:30:49.230
<v Speaker 1>exactly he didn't say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you take a thousand milligrams of</v>

3379
02:30:49.231 --> 02:30:51.630
<v Speaker 1>vitamin c.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said if you do,</v>

3380
02:30:51.840 --> 02:30:53.880
<v Speaker 1>you absorb 93 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you take.</v>

3381
02:30:53.900 --> 02:30:57.030
<v Speaker 1>He's just giving numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying if you take a thousand</v>

3382
02:30:57.030 --> 02:30:58.980
<v Speaker 1>milligrams of vitamin c,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not recommending that as a dose.</v>

3383
02:30:59.190 --> 02:31:01.500
<v Speaker 1>He's saying if you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your body absorbs 19 percent.</v>

3384
02:31:01.501 --> 02:31:03.780
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's saying if you wrap it in a</v>

3385
02:31:03.781 --> 02:31:06.420
<v Speaker 1>lyposomal structure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your body absorbs 93 percent.</v>

3386
02:31:07.140 --> 02:31:09.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm kind of stunned on what you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying.</v>

3387
02:31:09.331 --> 02:31:12.630
<v Speaker 1>I got wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said he said a thousand milligrams of</v>

3388
02:31:12.631 --> 02:31:17.631
<v Speaker 1>vitamin c and you'll absorb 93 percent</v>
<v Speaker 1>of what you said wrong in was he's</v>

3389
02:31:17.701 --> 02:31:20.850
<v Speaker 1>telling you to take a thousand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't telling you to take anything.</v>

3390
02:31:21.870 --> 02:31:25.800
<v Speaker 1>What he's saying is if you take a</v>
<v Speaker 1>thousand milligrams of vitamin c,</v>

3391
02:31:25.801 --> 02:31:30.450
<v Speaker 1>your body will only absorb 19 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you wrap it in this lyposomal</v>

3392
02:31:30.451 --> 02:31:32.550
<v Speaker 1>structure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your body will absorb 93 percent.</v>

3393
02:31:32.551 --> 02:31:35.430
<v Speaker 1>I know he's not recommending that as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>daily allowance.</v>

3394
02:31:35.431 --> 02:31:38.430
<v Speaker 1>He's not telling you to take it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're trying to find a way to be right</v>

3395
02:31:38.431 --> 02:31:39.264
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

3396
02:31:39.740 --> 02:31:42.500
<v Speaker 4>I think I'm repeating exactly what you</v>
<v Speaker 4>just said.</v>

3397
02:31:42.501 --> 02:31:45.680
<v Speaker 4>I'm just kind of stunned at that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're pointing out what I said was</v>

3398
02:31:45.681 --> 02:31:46.760
<v Speaker 4>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>

3399
02:31:49.190 --> 02:31:50.023
<v Speaker 4>I mean this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is.</v>

3400
02:31:50.050 --> 02:31:53.570
<v Speaker 4>This is kind of deteriorating and it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>not entertainment quality here.</v>

3401
02:31:53.571 --> 02:31:54.404
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

3402
02:31:54.670 --> 02:31:58.600
<v Speaker 1>Explaining where you air in the way you</v>
<v Speaker 1>cast judgment and that you're.</v>

3403
02:31:58.610 --> 02:32:00.640
<v Speaker 1>You're incorrect about what he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

3404
02:32:00.790 --> 02:32:03.880
<v Speaker 1>but you were your main point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where he's wrong is why do you need that</v>

3405
02:32:03.881 --> 02:32:05.560
<v Speaker 1>much vitamin c in the first place?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the big deal,</v>

3406
02:32:05.561 --> 02:32:07.770
<v Speaker 1>but this lyposomal thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were trying to diminish him.</v>

3407
02:32:07.780 --> 02:32:09.610
<v Speaker 1>You're trying to find ways to diminish</v>
<v Speaker 1>his point,</v>

3408
02:32:09.790 --> 02:32:11.460
<v Speaker 1>but he's correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All he gave me,</v>

3409
02:32:11.461 --> 02:32:14.650
<v Speaker 1>he gave you a number.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If he didn't give you a number of a</v>

3410
02:32:14.650 --> 02:32:16.090
<v Speaker 1>thousand milligrams would have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said 100 milligrams.</v>

3411
02:32:16.091 --> 02:32:17.230
<v Speaker 1>What have you said?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Five hundred milligrams.</v>

3412
02:32:17.231 --> 02:32:20.560
<v Speaker 1>this point was your body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He came up with a number for a point of</v>

3413
02:32:20.561 --> 02:32:22.000
<v Speaker 1>reference,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but his point was,</v>

3414
02:32:22.001 --> 02:32:26.090
<v Speaker 1>your body only absorbs 19 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said then if yoU take it lyposomal,</v>

3415
02:32:26.120 --> 02:32:30.880
<v Speaker 1>your body absorbs 93 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't mean that you have to take a</v>

3416
02:32:30.880 --> 02:32:33.070
<v Speaker 1>thousand milligrams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't tell you to take a thousand</v>

3417
02:32:33.070 --> 02:32:35.500
<v Speaker 1>milligrams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just gave you a point of reference</v>

3418
02:32:35.560 --> 02:32:40.390
<v Speaker 1>for explaining the bioavailability of</v>
<v Speaker 1>lipos somo products as opposed to the</v>

3419
02:32:40.391 --> 02:32:41.340
<v Speaker 1>standard form of</v>

3420
02:32:41.580 --> 02:32:42.290
<v Speaker 4>desk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Justin,</v>

3421
02:32:42.290 --> 02:32:47.290
<v Speaker 4>can I just summarize my position and we</v>
<v Speaker 4>can move on just in two points.</v>

3422
02:32:48.200 --> 02:32:52.580
<v Speaker 4>Point number one is he used very quack</v>
<v Speaker 4>like language throughout the nine</v>

3423
02:32:52.581 --> 02:32:54.470
<v Speaker 4>minutes that I listened to saying it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>amazing,</v>

3424
02:32:54.471 --> 02:32:55.520
<v Speaker 4>and I became.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3425
02:32:55.580 --> 02:32:56.540
<v Speaker 4>sweetie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

3426
02:32:56.670 --> 02:32:59.960
<v Speaker 4>Say which?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Which made me very skeptical of his</v>

3427
02:33:00.290 --> 02:33:02.540
<v Speaker 4>motivations and of the quality of his</v>
<v Speaker 4>information.</v>

3428
02:33:03.350 --> 02:33:05.180
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>number two,</v>

3429
02:33:06.830 --> 02:33:09.740
<v Speaker 4>you do not need to take a thousand</v>
<v Speaker 4>milligrams of vitamin c.</v>

3430
02:33:09.830 --> 02:33:13.430
<v Speaker 4>He didn't say you do this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is not a strong man.</v>

3431
02:33:13.460 --> 02:33:15.410
<v Speaker 4>This is right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is summarizing my point.</v>

3432
02:33:15.500 --> 02:33:17.000
<v Speaker 4>My point right now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his point,</v>

3433
02:33:17.001 --> 02:33:22.001
<v Speaker 4>my point is that you do not need to take</v>
<v Speaker 4>doses of any doses of vitamins or other</v>

3434
02:33:22.581 --> 02:33:25.580
<v Speaker 4>supplements unless you're one of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>rare people who for some reason it has a</v>

3435
02:33:25.581 --> 02:33:26.900
<v Speaker 4>vitamin deficiency,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is,</v>

3436
02:33:27.540 --> 02:33:29.720
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you need to be pretty sick or have some</v>

3437
02:33:29.721 --> 02:33:32.720
<v Speaker 4>problem to have any need for any that</v>
<v Speaker 4>you were criticizing him for saying that</v>

3438
02:33:32.721 --> 02:33:34.850
<v Speaker 4>you need a thousand milligrams,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is in fact not what he said.</v>

3439
02:33:34.940 --> 02:33:35.773
<v Speaker 4>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I.</v>

3440
02:33:35.920 --> 02:33:38.090
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think he would have said that</v>

3441
02:33:38.091 --> 02:33:42.230
<v Speaker 4>unless he was trying to imply or suggest</v>
<v Speaker 4>that he's going to take vitamin c.</v>

3442
02:33:42.870 --> 02:33:44.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure he thinks it's a good thing to</v>
<v Speaker 1>take.</v>

3443
02:33:44.331 --> 02:33:46.520
<v Speaker 1>Vitamin c is a matter of fact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the reason why people don't get</v>

3444
02:33:46.521 --> 02:33:47.180
<v Speaker 1>scurvy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3445
02:33:47.180 --> 02:33:49.520
<v Speaker 1>Take vitamin c is good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It keeps that from happening.</v>

3446
02:33:49.521 --> 02:33:52.040
<v Speaker 1>If you go on a long boat trip with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bunch of assholes who were eating dried</v>

3447
02:33:52.041 --> 02:33:53.450
<v Speaker 1>meat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take your vitamins.</v>

3448
02:33:53.451 --> 02:33:54.111
<v Speaker 1>Say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

3449
02:33:54.111 --> 02:33:57.440
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing wrong with vitamin c,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what he's saying is he gave a point</v>

3450
02:33:57.441 --> 02:33:59.420
<v Speaker 1>of reference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He started with a thousand milligrams.</v>

3451
02:33:59.421 --> 02:34:00.770
<v Speaker 1>If you take that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he.</v>

3452
02:34:00.771 --> 02:34:03.880
<v Speaker 1>It's a figure of speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You will absorb 19 percent if you take</v>

3453
02:34:03.881 --> 02:34:04.671
<v Speaker 1>it liable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So emily,</v>

3454
02:34:04.671 --> 02:34:06.560
<v Speaker 1>you absorb 93 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're beating a dead horse.</v>

3455
02:34:06.680 --> 02:34:07.513
<v Speaker 1>You're wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here</v>

3456
02:34:08.900 --> 02:34:12.190
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I am flabbergasted that you're saying</v>

3457
02:34:12.191 --> 02:34:14.170
<v Speaker 4>I'm wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but let's just move on.</v>

3458
02:34:14.171 --> 02:34:15.550
<v Speaker 4>I mean this is just going around in</v>
<v Speaker 4>circles.</v>

3459
02:34:15.551 --> 02:34:17.400
<v Speaker 4>This is silly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's,</v>

3460
02:34:17.460 --> 02:34:18.190
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

3461
02:34:18.190 --> 02:34:22.000
<v Speaker 1>it's highlighting the way you think and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way one of the things about the way</v>

3462
02:34:22.001 --> 02:34:26.620
<v Speaker 1>you think is this desire to be right and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a very strong desire to win.</v>

3463
02:34:26.621 --> 02:34:30.070
<v Speaker 1>You're criticizing him to be right and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think you're wrong and I think you're</v>

3464
02:34:30.071 --> 02:34:32.710
<v Speaker 1>wrong about a couple of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're wrong about your initial</v>

3465
02:34:32.711 --> 02:34:36.370
<v Speaker 1>description of the way he described</v>
<v Speaker 1>things as wrong and you don't like the</v>

3466
02:34:36.371 --> 02:34:40.030
<v Speaker 1>way he used adjectives or hyperbole and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you said that's what I'm talking about.</v>

3467
02:34:40.120 --> 02:34:41.540
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not exactly what you're talking</v>

3468
02:34:41.640 --> 02:34:46.640
<v Speaker 1>type of language was what was what I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>real good point is that he said that you</v>

3469
02:34:47.440 --> 02:34:50.500
<v Speaker 1>could not get drunk or that his friend</v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't drunk,</v>

3470
02:34:50.501 --> 02:34:53.350
<v Speaker 1>but that's a really good point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That sounds like nonsense to me still</v>

3471
02:34:53.351 --> 02:34:55.300
<v Speaker 1>sounds like nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a,</v>

3472
02:34:55.450 --> 02:34:58.900
<v Speaker 1>I think he exaggerated or I think he</v>
<v Speaker 1>told an anecdotal story of someone who's</v>

3473
02:34:58.901 --> 02:34:59.734
<v Speaker 1>bullshitting him.</v>

3474
02:35:00.340 --> 02:35:02.290
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those nights where you drink and drink</v>

3475
02:35:02.291 --> 02:35:06.750
<v Speaker 1>and drink and you just can't get drunk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've had this experience fucked up.</v>

3476
02:35:07.030 --> 02:35:07.841
<v Speaker 1>What I'm saying is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

3477
02:35:07.841 --> 02:35:09.940
<v Speaker 1>you're a hard line dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't smoke any weed at all.</v>

3478
02:35:09.941 --> 02:35:11.380
<v Speaker 1>Do you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>

3479
02:35:11.770 --> 02:35:14.680
<v Speaker 1>That's what you need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need a little cooky and a massage.</v>

3480
02:35:14.890 --> 02:35:17.680
<v Speaker 1>Here we get a thai massage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pull your arms back to walk in your</v>

3481
02:35:17.681 --> 02:35:19.120
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Relax,</v>

3482
02:35:19.140 --> 02:35:19.840
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You.</v>

3483
02:35:19.840 --> 02:35:20.673
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

3484
02:35:20.710 --> 02:35:24.160
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of merit in what you're</v>

3485
02:35:24.161 --> 02:35:26.050
<v Speaker 1>doing and there's a lot of merit and</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you're saying.</v>

3486
02:35:27.140 --> 02:35:30.700
<v Speaker 1>I understand your arguments for this</v>
<v Speaker 1>hard stance.</v>

3487
02:35:30.701 --> 02:35:33.570
<v Speaker 1>I totally understand it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I also think that sometimes</v>

3488
02:35:33.590 --> 02:35:37.060
<v Speaker 1>diminishes your actual point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which can many times be very valid.</v>

3489
02:35:38.470 --> 02:35:39.310
<v Speaker 1>Such as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3490
02:35:39.311 --> 02:35:40.270
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this whole shit.</v>

3491
02:35:40.271 --> 02:35:44.140
<v Speaker 1>We're doing this dance about vitamin c.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do you think he brought it up?</v>

3492
02:35:44.141 --> 02:35:44.650
<v Speaker 1>Why do you think?</v>

3493
02:35:44.650 --> 02:35:46.510
<v Speaker 1>You talked about wanting to talk about</v>
<v Speaker 1>glutathione.</v>

3494
02:35:46.690 --> 02:35:49.060
<v Speaker 1>He wanted to talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you listen to the whole podcast,</v>

3495
02:35:49.061 --> 02:35:52.990
<v Speaker 1>he talks about a variety of different</v>
<v Speaker 1>ways that we can improve our health and</v>

3496
02:35:52.991 --> 02:35:55.720
<v Speaker 1>things to avoid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially head impacts and he,</v>

3497
02:35:55.721 --> 02:35:56.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it goes into depth.</v>

3498
02:35:57.130 --> 02:36:02.130
<v Speaker 1>He's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a very interesting and very</v>

3499
02:36:02.231 --> 02:36:04.360
<v Speaker 1>charitable guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not a bad guy at all.</v>

3500
02:36:04.450 --> 02:36:09.450
<v Speaker 1>So I was confused as to I could see how</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would get upset that statement,</v>

3501
02:36:10.180 --> 02:36:12.370
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But All that other stuff leading up to</v>

3502
02:36:12.371 --> 02:36:15.370
<v Speaker 1>the statement that sort of flavor the</v>
<v Speaker 1>statement and make it even worse and</v>

3503
02:36:15.371 --> 02:36:16.930
<v Speaker 1>grander turned out to not be true</v>

3504
02:36:17.640 --> 02:36:21.090
<v Speaker 4>anytime.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anytime you're suggesting selling,</v>

3505
02:36:21.091 --> 02:36:26.091
<v Speaker 4>promoting miraculously easy solutions to</v>
<v Speaker 4>complicated problems that should raise a</v>

3506
02:36:26.581 --> 02:36:30.690
<v Speaker 4>huge red flag.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And all of the language he was using</v>

3507
02:36:30.691 --> 02:36:35.691
<v Speaker 4>suggested a miraculously easy solution.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Words like the words he was using,</v>

3508
02:36:35.970 --> 02:36:37.860
<v Speaker 4>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>being.</v>

3509
02:36:37.861 --> 02:36:39.390
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he actually,</v>

3510
02:36:39.391 --> 02:36:42.270
<v Speaker 4>in his defense,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he used a lot of those words just to</v>

3511
02:36:42.271 --> 02:36:46.740
<v Speaker 4>describe it's a fax as an antioxidant,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is pretty much universally</v>

3512
02:36:46.741 --> 02:36:48.230
<v Speaker 4>accepted online.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3513
02:36:48.570 --> 02:36:51.660
<v Speaker 4>well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But what effects is an antioxidant?</v>

3514
02:36:51.690 --> 02:36:53.310
<v Speaker 4>It's a strong antioxidant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>what has,</v>

3515
02:36:53.311 --> 02:36:57.390
<v Speaker 4>what has been what the current state of</v>
<v Speaker 4>antIoxidant research is that</v>

3516
02:36:57.391 --> 02:37:00.750
<v Speaker 4>supplementation has no benefit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The antioxidants that you get from your</v>

3517
02:37:00.751 --> 02:37:03.390
<v Speaker 4>normal diet are more than enough that</v>
<v Speaker 4>your body can,</v>

3518
02:37:03.391 --> 02:37:06.750
<v Speaker 4>will need to use supplementation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>has no benefit.</v>

3519
02:37:06.830 --> 02:37:09.250
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how did they can lighten me?</v>

3520
02:37:09.490 --> 02:37:13.870
<v Speaker 1>How do they test to see the benefit of</v>
<v Speaker 1>antioxidants and antioxidants?</v>

3521
02:37:13.871 --> 02:37:14.550
<v Speaker 1>A couple minutes.</v>

3522
02:37:14.550 --> 02:37:15.640
<v Speaker 4>This goes to the whole</v>

3523
02:37:16.340 --> 02:37:18.950
<v Speaker 2>question of oxidation versus</v>
<v Speaker 2>antioxidant.</v>

3524
02:37:19.040 --> 02:37:20.780
<v Speaker 2>Sounds like it's a really simple</v>
<v Speaker 2>question.</v>

3525
02:37:20.810 --> 02:37:25.810
<v Speaker 2>Good versus bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oxidation is part of so many different</v>

3526
02:37:25.971 --> 02:37:29.990
<v Speaker 2>parts of your metabolism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Converting the energy and sell to</v>

3527
02:37:30.590 --> 02:37:32.990
<v Speaker 2>converting your chemical energy and sell</v>
<v Speaker 2>to Connecticut injured.</v>

3528
02:37:33.070 --> 02:37:34.430
<v Speaker 2>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's oxidation.</v>

3529
02:37:34.990 --> 02:37:39.260
<v Speaker 2>You can't just simply say antioxidants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good oxidation,</v>

3530
02:37:39.261 --> 02:37:40.880
<v Speaker 2>bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not as simple as that.</v>

3531
02:37:40.910 --> 02:37:42.980
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but no one's saying what you're saying</v>

3532
02:37:42.981 --> 02:37:46.580
<v Speaker 2>is that what you're saying is</v>
<v Speaker 2>antioxidants have no benefit.</v>

3533
02:37:46.640 --> 02:37:49.760
<v Speaker 2>If you take them as a supplement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>supplementation of antioxidants has been</v>

3534
02:37:49.761 --> 02:37:52.190
<v Speaker 2>found to have no benefit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where is that?</v>

3535
02:37:52.550 --> 02:37:53.600
<v Speaker 2>Is that published somewhere?</v>

3536
02:37:55.820 --> 02:37:59.270
<v Speaker 2>If you google that sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you'll find it supplementation</v>

3537
02:37:59.271 --> 02:38:01.970
<v Speaker 2>of antioxidants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but how do they know the difference</v>

3538
02:38:01.971 --> 02:38:05.030
<v Speaker 2>between taking it with the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The benefits of taking it with food and</v>

3539
02:38:05.031 --> 02:38:06.890
<v Speaker 2>the benefits of taking it as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>supplement.</v>

3540
02:38:07.130 --> 02:38:09.020
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because we can chemically measure what's</v>

3541
02:38:09.021 --> 02:38:11.090
<v Speaker 2>in the food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can chemically measure what's in a</v>

3542
02:38:11.091 --> 02:38:14.210
<v Speaker 2>supplement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know how much your body uses and</v>

3543
02:38:16.580 --> 02:38:19.880
<v Speaker 2>the number of tests that have been done</v>
<v Speaker 2>are all going to use different</v>

3544
02:38:19.881 --> 02:38:22.520
<v Speaker 2>methodologies and I'm sorry I did not</v>
<v Speaker 2>memorize.</v>

3545
02:38:23.210 --> 02:38:24.530
<v Speaker 2>I'm honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't tell you.</v>

3546
02:38:24.650 --> 02:38:27.650
<v Speaker 2>I'm honestly curious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I do as a science writer is</v>

3547
02:38:27.651 --> 02:38:31.570
<v Speaker 2>summarize the available research,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what?</v>

3548
02:38:31.610 --> 02:38:36.020
<v Speaker 2>This is what I'm confused about you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you are taking it in food,</v>

3549
02:38:36.080 --> 02:38:39.410
<v Speaker 2>there's a benefit from it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The amount of oxidation that you get</v>

3550
02:38:39.411 --> 02:38:40.670
<v Speaker 2>into normal diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3551
02:38:40.910 --> 02:38:45.910
<v Speaker 2>If you don't eat a normal diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I presume that if you were going on</v>

3552
02:38:46.521 --> 02:38:49.910
<v Speaker 2>a starvation diet or something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I suppose you'd probably want to</v>

3553
02:38:49.911 --> 02:38:50.870
<v Speaker 2>take a multivitamin.</v>

3554
02:38:50.870 --> 02:38:53.820
<v Speaker 2>You at least get your vitamins.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You wouldn't be getting anything else</v>

3555
02:38:53.821 --> 02:38:55.610
<v Speaker 2>that you'd need,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you'd be getting vitamins.</v>

3556
02:38:56.420 --> 02:39:00.440
<v Speaker 2>I suppose the same is true of just about</v>
<v Speaker 2>any supplement if you're going to starve</v>

3557
02:39:00.441 --> 02:39:01.340
<v Speaker 2>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the best,</v>

3558
02:39:01.430 --> 02:39:06.430
<v Speaker 2>the best advice of all is to simply eat</v>
<v Speaker 2>a normal healthy diet because those</v>

3559
02:39:06.681 --> 02:39:07.590
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those,</v>

3560
02:39:07.630 --> 02:39:11.480
<v Speaker 2>those aspects of nutrition or available</v>
<v Speaker 2>in that normal healthy diet and their</v>

3561
02:39:11.481 --> 02:39:13.040
<v Speaker 2>bio available,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

3562
02:39:13.220 --> 02:39:16.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's six basic things that you get in</v>

3563
02:39:16.131 --> 02:39:18.620
<v Speaker 2>food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Number one is water.</v>

3564
02:39:18.860 --> 02:39:23.860
<v Speaker 2>Number two is amino acids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A number three is carbohydrates,</v>

3565
02:39:24.290 --> 02:39:25.370
<v Speaker 2>sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3566
02:39:25.690 --> 02:39:29.750
<v Speaker 2>number four is fats and five.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Number six,</v>

3567
02:39:29.751 --> 02:39:30.810
<v Speaker 2>what am I missing here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3568
02:39:30.811 --> 02:39:33.530
<v Speaker 2>fives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>vitamins and minerals.</v>

3569
02:39:34.220 --> 02:39:37.340
<v Speaker 2>So these are all the different classes</v>
<v Speaker 2>of things that you need and any normal</v>

3570
02:39:37.341 --> 02:39:40.790
<v Speaker 2>healthy diet has all of those that your</v>
<v Speaker 2>body is going to use because actually</v>

3571
02:39:40.791 --> 02:39:43.850
<v Speaker 2>you need quite tiny amounts of all of</v>
<v Speaker 2>those things.</v>

3572
02:39:43.851 --> 02:39:45.800
<v Speaker 2>Your body actually uses very tiny</v>
<v Speaker 2>amounts.</v>

3573
02:39:46.280 --> 02:39:48.830
<v Speaker 2>Any normal diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reason you poop and pee is because</v>

3574
02:39:48.831 --> 02:39:53.450
<v Speaker 2>you ate more than you needed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Supplementation is trying to pour water</v>

3575
02:39:53.451 --> 02:39:55.640
<v Speaker 2>on a bucket that's already overflowing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wait a minute,</v>

3576
02:39:55.641 --> 02:39:56.300
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute.</v>

3577
02:39:56.300 --> 02:39:58.250
<v Speaker 2>The reason you poop ps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not because he ate,</v>

3578
02:39:58.640 --> 02:40:01.820
<v Speaker 2>drank more than you needed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to poop and pee if you just</v>

3579
02:40:01.821 --> 02:40:04.490
<v Speaker 2>drink the exact right amount too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can poop and pee all the way to</v>

3580
02:40:04.491 --> 02:40:05.324
<v Speaker 2>starvation.</v>

3581
02:40:07.180 --> 02:40:07.730
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't.</v>

3582
02:40:07.730 --> 02:40:12.110
<v Speaker 2>You'll stop pooping if you stop eating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you keep drinking water when the</v>

3583
02:40:12.111 --> 02:40:15.000
<v Speaker 2>water passes through your body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not because you drank too much</v>

3584
02:40:15.001 --> 02:40:19.080
<v Speaker 2>water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You drink.</v>

3585
02:40:19.110 --> 02:40:21.380
<v Speaker 2>If you drink a glass of water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

3586
02:40:21.570 --> 02:40:25.290
<v Speaker 2>and that water goes through is exactly</v>
<v Speaker 2>what your body needed in a few hours,</v>

3587
02:40:25.291 --> 02:40:27.240
<v Speaker 2>you're gonna need it as a waste</v>
<v Speaker 2>eliminator.</v>

3588
02:40:27.270 --> 02:40:30.960
<v Speaker 2>Your kidneys are going to continue</v>
<v Speaker 2>producing urine until there is till you</v>

3589
02:40:30.961 --> 02:40:34.350
<v Speaker 2>dehydrate until you're dehydrated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's not a balancing act where</v>

3590
02:40:34.351 --> 02:40:38.130
<v Speaker 2>you can hit the certain sweet spot where</v>
<v Speaker 2>you eat exactly what you need or drink</v>

3591
02:40:38.131 --> 02:40:39.420
<v Speaker 2>exactly what you need.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

3592
02:40:39.490 --> 02:40:41.400
<v Speaker 2>I'm not talking about finding a sweet</v>
<v Speaker 2>spot.</v>

3593
02:40:41.401 --> 02:40:44.430
<v Speaker 2>What I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pooping and peeing is because you ate</v>

3594
02:40:44.431 --> 02:40:45.450
<v Speaker 2>too much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>drank too much.</v>

3595
02:40:45.780 --> 02:40:48.030
<v Speaker 2>That's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're taking my words to literally.</v>

3596
02:40:48.031 --> 02:40:49.650
<v Speaker 2>I will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a very literal statement,</v>

3597
02:40:50.280 --> 02:40:51.113
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>

3598
02:40:53.130 --> 02:40:53.611
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come on.</v>

3599
02:40:53.611 --> 02:40:54.900
<v Speaker 2>That's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Medical statement.</v>

3600
02:40:54.901 --> 02:40:58.560
<v Speaker 2>A doctor would listen to that</v>
<v Speaker 2>medical statement.</v>

3601
02:40:58.770 --> 02:41:03.150
<v Speaker 2>What are you saying that what I'm saying</v>
<v Speaker 2>is supplementation of any of these</v>

3602
02:41:03.151 --> 02:41:06.300
<v Speaker 2>things is pouring water on a bucket</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's already over full.</v>

3603
02:41:06.660 --> 02:41:10.080
<v Speaker 2>You don't need more sugar than your body</v>
<v Speaker 2>is going to use.</v>

3604
02:41:10.140 --> 02:41:12.930
<v Speaker 2>You don't need more minerals than your</v>
<v Speaker 2>body is going to use.</v>

3605
02:41:13.080 --> 02:41:16.230
<v Speaker 2>You don't need more vitamins than your</v>
<v Speaker 2>body's going to use.</v>

3606
02:41:17.070 --> 02:41:20.280
<v Speaker 2>Anything that you eat of those that is</v>
<v Speaker 2>more than you're gonna use is going to</v>

3607
02:41:20.290 --> 02:41:22.140
<v Speaker 2>be treated from your body somehow or</v>
<v Speaker 2>other,</v>

3608
02:41:22.141 --> 02:41:24.810
<v Speaker 2>sooner or later.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That makes sense.</v>

3609
02:41:24.900 --> 02:41:26.280
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3610
02:41:27.350 --> 02:41:28.183
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3611
02:41:28.260 --> 02:41:30.360
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would love to know what studies they</v>

3612
02:41:30.361 --> 02:41:34.140
<v Speaker 2>did on antioxidants and what they know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the benefits of.</v>

3613
02:41:34.141 --> 02:41:35.340
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they absolutely have measured the</v>

3614
02:41:35.341 --> 02:41:38.080
<v Speaker 2>benefits of it from food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the individual nutrients and</v>

3615
02:41:38.081 --> 02:41:40.350
<v Speaker 2>antioxidants and what sort of effect</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have on the human body.</v>

3616
02:41:40.490 --> 02:41:43.620
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what I'd really be curious to find</v>

3617
02:41:43.621 --> 02:41:45.870
<v Speaker 2>out what studies disproved that or prove</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

3618
02:41:45.871 --> 02:41:46.620
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here,</v>

3619
02:41:46.620 --> 02:41:48.810
<v Speaker 2>if you're on google right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>google scup,</v>

3620
02:41:48.820 --> 02:41:51.810
<v Speaker 2>toyed antioxidant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not going to read your stuff.</v>

3621
02:41:51.811 --> 02:41:52.960
<v Speaker 2>Silly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to,</v>

3622
02:41:52.970 --> 02:41:55.440
<v Speaker 2>if I'm going to google stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to google people that disagree</v>

3623
02:41:55.441 --> 02:41:57.390
<v Speaker 2>with you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if there's a lot of people that do</v>

3624
02:41:57.391 --> 02:41:58.950
<v Speaker 2>agree with you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in all fairness online,</v>

3625
02:41:59.000 --> 02:42:00.300
<v Speaker 2>if if you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you.</v>

3626
02:42:00.301 --> 02:42:03.090
<v Speaker 2>If you want to find out if you want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>ask what my sources were,</v>

3627
02:42:03.091 --> 02:42:04.980
<v Speaker 2>where I got the information,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's where you'll find it,</v>

3628
02:42:05.190 --> 02:42:06.780
<v Speaker 2>the references at the bottom of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>episode.</v>

3629
02:42:06.990 --> 02:42:09.900
<v Speaker 2>I just wonder what the motivation of</v>
<v Speaker 2>these studies were,</v>

3630
02:42:09.901 --> 02:42:11.460
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the protocol was,</v>

3631
02:42:11.461 --> 02:42:14.910
<v Speaker 2>and there's a lot of variables like this</v>
<v Speaker 2>new study that came out that said case</v>

3632
02:42:14.911 --> 02:42:18.090
<v Speaker 2>closed multivitamin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Researchers came out and said that</v>

3633
02:42:18.091 --> 02:42:21.090
<v Speaker 2>multivitamins don't work well if you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know what the study was,</v>

3634
02:42:21.091 --> 02:42:22.820
<v Speaker 2>that they actually studied the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3635
02:42:23.050 --> 02:42:26.310
<v Speaker 2>the protocol that they used and what</v>
<v Speaker 2>they actually tried to do.</v>

3636
02:42:26.320 --> 02:42:30.930
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of irresponsible statement to</v>
<v Speaker 2>say vitamins don't work.</v>

3637
02:42:30.931 --> 02:42:33.510
<v Speaker 2>case closed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What they did was they gave</v>

3638
02:42:33.630 --> 02:42:38.630
<v Speaker 2>multivitamins these hard multivitamins</v>
<v Speaker 2>to physicians over age 65 and they</v>

3639
02:42:38.881 --> 02:42:41.580
<v Speaker 2>showed no improvement in cognitive</v>
<v Speaker 2>decline,</v>

3640
02:42:41.820 --> 02:42:43.530
<v Speaker 2>so they took people that were already</v>
<v Speaker 2>declining.</v>

3641
02:42:43.710 --> 02:42:47.400
<v Speaker 2>They gave him vitamins that were these</v>
<v Speaker 2>hard fucking synthetic vitamins and they</v>

3642
02:42:47.401 --> 02:42:49.950
<v Speaker 2>showed no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no decline,</v>

3643
02:42:49.980 --> 02:42:52.860
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no ceasing in the climbing of their</v>

3644
02:42:52.861 --> 02:42:54.570
<v Speaker 2>cognitive function.</v>
<v Speaker 2>another one,</v>

3645
02:42:54.840 --> 02:42:58.560
<v Speaker 2>high dose multivitamins had no effect on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the progression of heart disease and</v>

3646
02:42:58.561 --> 02:43:01.220
<v Speaker 2>heart attack survivors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So these people are already fucked.</v>

3647
02:43:01.221 --> 02:43:03.990
<v Speaker 2>they already had a heart attack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They give them high levels of these.</v>

3648
02:43:03.991 --> 02:43:06.210
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>synthetic multivitamins,</v>

3649
02:43:06.211 --> 02:43:08.110
<v Speaker 2>these compressed pill form,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3650
02:43:08.310 --> 02:43:10.920
<v Speaker 2>centrum one a day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>jammies that nobody digests,</v>

3651
02:43:11.170 --> 02:43:13.450
<v Speaker 2>and then another one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the third study,</v>

3652
02:43:13.451 --> 02:43:17.290
<v Speaker 2>which actually is fairly positive</v>
<v Speaker 2>concludes that limited evidence supports</v>

3653
02:43:17.291 --> 02:43:20.830
<v Speaker 2>any benefit from vitamin and mineral</v>
<v Speaker 2>supplementation for the prevention of</v>

3654
02:43:20.831 --> 02:43:22.690
<v Speaker 2>cancer or cardiovascular disease.</v>

3655
02:43:22.810 --> 02:43:26.850
<v Speaker 2>two trials found a small borderline</v>
<v Speaker 2>significant benefit from multivitamins,</v>

3656
02:43:26.851 --> 02:43:31.851
<v Speaker 2>supplements on cancer in men only and no</v>
<v Speaker 2>effect on cardiovascular disease.</v>

3657
02:43:32.291 --> 02:43:36.070
<v Speaker 2>So that's a small barely measurable</v>
<v Speaker 2>effect from these shitty synthetic</v>

3658
02:43:36.071 --> 02:43:40.270
<v Speaker 2>vitamins on people who are fuCked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People who are already sick,</v>

3659
02:43:40.570 --> 02:43:42.430
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their bodies are already dying.</v>

3660
02:43:42.560 --> 02:43:47.520
<v Speaker 2>Like to say that vitamins don't work</v>
<v Speaker 2>based on those three components is a</v>

3661
02:43:47.521 --> 02:43:48.550
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3662
02:43:48.560 --> 02:43:52.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a really unfortunate aspect of the world</v>

3663
02:43:52.151 --> 02:43:55.630
<v Speaker 2>of science reporting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something that I've come to learn over</v>

3664
02:43:55.631 --> 02:43:57.120
<v Speaker 2>and over and over again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>

3665
02:43:57.140 --> 02:44:02.140
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty depressing is how news makes</v>
<v Speaker 2>it from the lab into,</v>

3666
02:44:03.030 --> 02:44:06.370
<v Speaker 2>onto people's computers or gotcha aspect</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the title,</v>

3667
02:44:06.371 --> 02:44:07.204
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3668
02:44:07.920 --> 02:44:11.530
<v Speaker 2>The fact is that universities were so</v>
<v Speaker 2>much research has done,</v>

3669
02:44:11.860 --> 02:44:16.860
<v Speaker 2>they have pr departments and they are</v>
<v Speaker 2>responsible for keeping attention on</v>

3670
02:44:17.351 --> 02:44:18.610
<v Speaker 2>this university,</v>
<v Speaker 2>keeping,</v>

3671
02:44:18.640 --> 02:44:22.960
<v Speaker 2>keeping the money flowing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the pr department at a university is</v>

3672
02:44:22.961 --> 02:44:27.760
<v Speaker 2>going to spin what they see as the most</v>
<v Speaker 2>reportable aspect of the research being</v>

3673
02:44:27.761 --> 02:44:28.360
<v Speaker 2>done.</v>

3674
02:44:28.360 --> 02:44:32.230
<v Speaker 2>They send out the press release and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>the press does exactly the same thing.</v>

3675
02:44:32.470 --> 02:44:35.710
<v Speaker 2>They look at it and look for the most</v>
<v Speaker 2>reportable aspect of this and it's</v>

3676
02:44:35.711 --> 02:44:36.800
<v Speaker 2>often,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3677
02:44:37.450 --> 02:44:41.380
<v Speaker 2>often it's completely wrong by the time</v>
<v Speaker 2>it gets to the presses because they'll</v>

3678
02:44:41.381 --> 02:44:45.520
<v Speaker 2>report the sensational aspect of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what you'll often see,</v>

3679
02:44:46.480 --> 02:44:48.790
<v Speaker 2>I follow a lot of science writers who do</v>
<v Speaker 2>this a lot,</v>

3680
02:44:49.120 --> 02:44:52.180
<v Speaker 2>is they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they kind of reverse engineer these</v>

3681
02:44:52.181 --> 02:44:55.150
<v Speaker 2>headlines that have become so prominent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's always.</v>

3682
02:44:55.151 --> 02:44:57.640
<v Speaker 2>Some scientists find that this will kill</v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

3683
02:44:57.670 --> 02:44:59.860
<v Speaker 2>Scientists find that this is a miracle</v>
<v Speaker 2>cure.</v>

3684
02:45:00.130 --> 02:45:03.100
<v Speaker 2>And when you reverse engineer those</v>
<v Speaker 2>headlines and go back and look at the</v>

3685
02:45:03.190 --> 02:45:06.550
<v Speaker 2>original research that was done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll find often it said exactly the</v>

3686
02:45:06.551 --> 02:45:10.690
<v Speaker 2>opposite of what the headline says.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really difficult to come up with,</v>

3687
02:45:11.160 --> 02:45:14.170
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of a journeyman's interpretation of</v>

3688
02:45:14.171 --> 02:45:16.540
<v Speaker 2>sCience news by reading,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by reading mass media.</v>

3689
02:45:17.250 --> 02:45:19.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They did publish the study though.</v>

3690
02:45:19.690 --> 02:45:22.090
<v Speaker 2>The title of this study is enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is enough,</v>

3691
02:45:22.091 --> 02:45:25.210
<v Speaker 2>stop wasting money on vitamin and</v>
<v Speaker 2>mineral supplements.</v>

3692
02:45:25.510 --> 02:45:27.910
<v Speaker 2>And this is the title of the article</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was released.</v>

3693
02:45:27.911 --> 02:45:32.490
<v Speaker 2>I think they took an inflammatory</v>
<v Speaker 2>position that I don't think it's</v>

3694
02:45:32.491 --> 02:45:35.050
<v Speaker 2>supported by the evidence and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>research that they presented.</v>

3695
02:45:35.080 --> 02:45:37.030
<v Speaker 2>And it's very short sighted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's many,</v>

3696
02:45:37.031 --> 02:45:41.410
<v Speaker 2>many aspects to a to health.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when you're dealing with someone who</v>

3697
02:45:41.411 --> 02:45:45.640
<v Speaker 2>is already really fucking sick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is all three of the people that</v>

3698
02:45:45.641 --> 02:45:48.810
<v Speaker 2>they described that they tested these</v>
<v Speaker 2>things on all groups of people,</v>

3699
02:45:49.120 --> 02:45:49.541
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

3700
02:45:49.541 --> 02:45:54.541
<v Speaker 2>you're dealing with a mean to try to</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the rate of decline in people that</v>

3701
02:45:55.121 --> 02:45:58.540
<v Speaker 2>have alzheimer's and the rate of decline</v>
<v Speaker 2>of people with cognitive decline.</v>

3702
02:45:59.220 --> 02:46:00.760
<v Speaker 2>We don'T have anything that's going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>stop that.</v>

3703
02:46:00.790 --> 02:46:02.790
<v Speaker 2>Like what makes you thiNk the vitamins</v>
<v Speaker 2>are going to stop it because the</v>

3704
02:46:02.791 --> 02:46:06.070
<v Speaker 2>vitamins don't stop it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Be things that would be benefIcial for</v>

3705
02:46:06.071 --> 02:46:10.070
<v Speaker 2>health are not stopping something that</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've never been able to stop.</v>

3706
02:46:10.250 --> 02:46:15.230
<v Speaker 1>That seems preposterous to say vitamins</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't work based on that evidence.</v>

3707
02:46:15.440 --> 02:46:19.760
<v Speaker 1>It seems to me like this is something</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was a predetermined conclusion or</v>

3708
02:46:19.761 --> 02:46:22.670
<v Speaker 1>the most inflammatory response,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wHich we're talking about it.</v>

3709
02:46:22.671 --> 02:46:24.500
<v Speaker 1>So it's effective in that sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

3710
02:46:24.580 --> 02:46:26.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So 10 minutes.</v>

3711
02:46:26.660 --> 02:46:28.400
<v Speaker 1>We're almost out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We turn into a pumpkin at three hours</v>

3712
02:46:28.401 --> 02:46:29.120
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

3713
02:46:29.120 --> 02:46:29.953
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

3714
02:46:30.920 --> 02:46:34.240
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there is a really unfortunate word and</v>

3715
02:46:34.241 --> 02:46:39.241
<v Speaker 4>it's consensus and the word consensus.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I describe it as unfortunate because it</v>

3716
02:46:39.641 --> 02:46:44.641
<v Speaker 4>has a very different meaning in popular</v>
<v Speaker 4>usage than it has in scientific fields.</v>

3717
02:46:45.400 --> 02:46:50.400
<v Speaker 4>In scientific fields.</v>
<v Speaker 4>we describe a consensus as something not</v>

3718
02:46:50.591 --> 02:46:52.660
<v Speaker 4>merely that most scientists generally</v>
<v Speaker 4>agree on,</v>

3719
02:46:52.661 --> 02:46:56.650
<v Speaker 4>although that's often true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What scientific consensus really means</v>

3720
02:46:56.680 --> 02:47:01.540
<v Speaker 4>is that this is research that has been</v>
<v Speaker 4>repeated in other labs and the results</v>

3721
02:47:01.541 --> 02:47:04.600
<v Speaker 4>have been confirmed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The results have been scrutinized.</v>

3722
02:47:04.840 --> 02:47:07.540
<v Speaker 4>People have tried to disprove them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People tried to find alternate</v>

3723
02:47:07.541 --> 02:47:11.440
<v Speaker 4>explanations and it has truly past a</v>
<v Speaker 4>certain level of scientific rigor.</v>

3724
02:47:11.680 --> 02:47:15.250
<v Speaker 4>Then we say we have a scIentific</v>
<v Speaker 4>consensus in science circles.</v>

3725
02:47:15.280 --> 02:47:20.050
<v Speaker 4>Consensus means a lot more than it does</v>
<v Speaker 4>in popular usage and you will find that</v>

3726
02:47:20.051 --> 02:47:25.051
<v Speaker 4>the consensus is that supplementation</v>
<v Speaker 4>has no benefit among healthy people who</v>

3727
02:47:26.171 --> 02:47:30.010
<v Speaker 4>don't have a deficiency due to some</v>
<v Speaker 4>strange cars,</v>

3728
02:47:30.011 --> 02:47:33.860
<v Speaker 4>whatever that might be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you will always find articles to</v>

3729
02:47:33.910 --> 02:47:38.910
<v Speaker 4>the contrary or articles like this that</v>
<v Speaker 4>sensationalize that into something that</v>

3730
02:47:39.071 --> 02:47:39.610
<v Speaker 4>it's not</v>

3731
02:47:39.610 --> 02:47:41.650
<v Speaker 1>sensationalize the the negative aspects</v>
<v Speaker 1>of it.</v>

3732
02:47:41.830 --> 02:47:46.830
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's really a consensus</v>
<v Speaker 1>about a supplementation because in order</v>

3733
02:47:46.931 --> 02:47:50.830
<v Speaker 1>to really totally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>completely monitor like the variations</v>

3734
02:47:50.831 --> 02:47:53.110
<v Speaker 1>between two human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd have to have two people that were</v>

3735
02:47:53.111 --> 02:47:56.470
<v Speaker 1>exactly the same genetically exactly the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same as far as their life experiences,</v>

3736
02:47:56.471 --> 02:47:59.860
<v Speaker 1>their life stress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the different factors that add up to</v>

3737
02:47:59.861 --> 02:48:03.550
<v Speaker 1>health.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is a massive range of factors that</v>

3738
02:48:03.551 --> 02:48:05.470
<v Speaker 1>come into play when you're dealing with</v>
<v Speaker 1>a person's health.</v>

3739
02:48:05.890 --> 02:48:09.070
<v Speaker 1>If you measure a bunch of people with</v>
<v Speaker 1>very good diets,</v>

3740
02:48:09.071 --> 02:48:12.730
<v Speaker 1>rich in green leafy vegetables and live</v>
<v Speaker 1>foods and all these different healthy</v>

3741
02:48:12.731 --> 02:48:15.850
<v Speaker 1>things and no bullshit and processed</v>
<v Speaker 1>foods,</v>

3742
02:48:16.120 --> 02:48:20.200
<v Speaker 1>and then you measure people who have the</v>
<v Speaker 1>typical american fast food dine,</v>

3743
02:48:20.201 --> 02:48:22.780
<v Speaker 1>I think you're going to see that these</v>
<v Speaker 1>nutrients is certainly beneficial to the</v>

3744
02:48:22.781 --> 02:48:25.780
<v Speaker 1>people that eat healthy food are</v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly going to have a,</v>

3745
02:48:25.940 --> 02:48:28.530
<v Speaker 1>a greater instance of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3746
02:48:28.540 --> 02:48:33.340
<v Speaker 1>of being healthy but to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to to really break it down and figure</v>

3747
02:48:33.341 --> 02:48:38.341
<v Speaker 1>out how much of an effect a nutritional</v>
<v Speaker 1>supplement would have based on based on</v>

3748
02:48:39.071 --> 02:48:41.860
<v Speaker 1>that would be like you'd have to take</v>
<v Speaker 1>the exact same people live in the exact</v>

3749
02:48:41.861 --> 02:48:45.000
<v Speaker 1>same lives and one of them would take a</v>
<v Speaker 1>supplement and one of them wouldn't me</v>

3750
02:48:45.030 --> 02:48:47.640
<v Speaker 1>be really hard to figure out and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd have to say,</v>

3751
02:48:47.810 --> 02:48:49.360
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you eat healthy,</v>

3752
02:48:49.361 --> 02:48:50.200
<v Speaker 1>it's the best way.</v>

3753
02:48:50.290 --> 02:48:52.660
<v Speaker 1>Everybody agrees on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I've heard a single person</v>

3754
02:48:52.661 --> 02:48:56.050
<v Speaker 1>who knows about health and nutrition</v>
<v Speaker 1>that says that you could eat shitty food</v>

3755
02:48:56.051 --> 02:48:57.460
<v Speaker 1>and just take vitamins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's impossible.</v>

3756
02:48:57.461 --> 02:48:58.840
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't work that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You.</v>

3757
02:48:58.930 --> 02:49:02.230
<v Speaker 1>There's certain aspects of food that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>just missing in pill form.</v>

3758
02:49:02.231 --> 02:49:05.440
<v Speaker 1>You're always better off getting fresh</v>
<v Speaker 1>leafy vegetables that are right out of</v>

3759
02:49:05.441 --> 02:49:10.441
<v Speaker 1>the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but taking supplements as well with a</v>

3760
02:49:10.711 --> 02:49:13.290
<v Speaker 1>very diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if your diet doesn't balance</v>

3761
02:49:13.291 --> 02:49:15.130
<v Speaker 1>out as long as we're aware of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>bioavailability,</v>

3762
02:49:15.390 --> 02:49:18.420
<v Speaker 1>those supplements,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then we're also aware that your body</v>

3763
02:49:18.421 --> 02:49:21.720
<v Speaker 1>can absorb some of those supplements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems to me like you're hedging your</v>

3764
02:49:21.721 --> 02:49:24.000
<v Speaker 1>bets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like it's a good idea to take a</v>

3765
02:49:24.420 --> 02:49:26.550
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>strong natural food based.</v>

3766
02:49:26.730 --> 02:49:30.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm a supplementation program.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3767
02:49:30.540 --> 02:49:32.310
<v Speaker 1>I think generally there's no harm in</v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

3768
02:49:32.400 --> 02:49:34.910
<v Speaker 1>no harm and no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can say except for the wallet right</v>

3769
02:49:34.990 --> 02:49:36.030
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just unnecessary.</v>

3770
02:49:36.030 --> 02:49:38.490
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if they're unnecessary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If your diet is not totally balanced.</v>

3771
02:49:38.540 --> 02:49:41.460
<v Speaker 1>Well makeup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think it maybe they'll make up</v>

3772
02:49:41.461 --> 02:49:44.820
<v Speaker 1>some slack and if it can make up some</v>
<v Speaker 1>slack than I think that is a,</v>

3773
02:49:44.830 --> 02:49:47.820
<v Speaker 1>that the beneficial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if you have a healthy diet,</v>

3774
02:49:47.821 --> 02:49:48.810
<v Speaker 1>you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't need it,</v>

3775
02:49:49.020 --> 02:49:52.570
<v Speaker 1>but there's a lot of shit that you get</v>
<v Speaker 1>from from vitamin supplementation like</v>

3776
02:49:53.300 --> 02:49:58.020
<v Speaker 1>like there's certain like five htp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like five htp which produces serotonin.</v>

3777
02:49:58.290 --> 02:50:00.900
<v Speaker 1>If you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're trying to get that from food,</v>

3778
02:50:01.140 --> 02:50:04.650
<v Speaker 1>you gotta eat like a fucking garbage bag</v>
<v Speaker 1>full of grass,</v>

3779
02:50:04.960 --> 02:50:05.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

3780
02:50:05.440 --> 02:50:07.980
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to the amount that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can take in a couple of pills.</v>

3781
02:50:07.981 --> 02:50:09.910
<v Speaker 1>The extracted form of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3782
02:50:09.920 --> 02:50:12.780
<v Speaker 1>the active nutrients like fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd have to eat a lot of stuff to get</v>

3783
02:50:12.781 --> 02:50:16.680
<v Speaker 1>that and I think that that science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these people have figured out how to</v>

3784
02:50:16.681 --> 02:50:17.580
<v Speaker 1>extract these things.</v>

3785
02:50:17.580 --> 02:50:20.070
<v Speaker 1>They're not just guessing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not just guessing what the</v>

3786
02:50:20.071 --> 02:50:24.430
<v Speaker 1>effects are on the body or guessing how</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get this stuff out of food or what.</v>

3787
02:50:24.440 --> 02:50:25.830
<v Speaker 1>What contains it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They know,</v>

3788
02:50:25.831 --> 02:50:28.920
<v Speaker 1>and that is science as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It always amazes me how the human race</v>

3789
02:50:28.921 --> 02:50:32.170
<v Speaker 1>managed to survive until this decade</v>
<v Speaker 1>before all these things were invented.</v>

3790
02:50:32.210 --> 02:50:34.110
<v Speaker 1>We survived,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not the idea.</v>

3791
02:50:34.111 --> 02:50:35.130
<v Speaker 1>The idea is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are we,</v>

3792
02:50:35.190 --> 02:50:37.740
<v Speaker 1>are we optimized?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And manY times,</v>

3793
02:50:37.741 --> 02:50:39.720
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many times we're not optimized.</v>

3794
02:50:40.220 --> 02:50:43.080
<v Speaker 1>We're optimized when we add supplements,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you know,</v>

3795
02:50:43.081 --> 02:50:46.500
<v Speaker 1>sometimes supplements can if you were in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a situation where you're not getting all</v>

3796
02:50:46.501 --> 02:50:50.010
<v Speaker 1>the beneficial nutrients,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you add them and then try to balance</v>

3797
02:50:50.011 --> 02:50:51.270
<v Speaker 1>out your diet as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it can.</v>

3798
02:50:51.330 --> 02:50:53.370
<v Speaker 1>It can aid you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's an either or.</v>

3799
02:50:53.580 --> 02:50:58.320
<v Speaker 1>I think undeniably healthy food is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>number one thing for for health healthy</v>

3800
02:50:58.321 --> 02:50:58.500
<v Speaker 1>food.</v>

3801
02:50:58.500 --> 02:51:01.680
<v Speaker 1>Your body is what I was talking to these</v>
<v Speaker 1>hunters yesterday and they were talking</v>

3802
02:51:01.681 --> 02:51:04.650
<v Speaker 1>about how bears that eat certain foods</v>
<v Speaker 1>are not good to eat.</v>

3803
02:51:04.980 --> 02:51:07.050
<v Speaker 1>Like if bears eat rotten fish and eat</v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

3804
02:51:07.051 --> 02:51:08.730
<v Speaker 1>like you literally taste the rotten</v>
<v Speaker 1>fish,</v>

3805
02:51:08.940 --> 02:51:12.720
<v Speaker 1>but if bears eat blueberries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're delicious and they're there.</v>

3806
02:51:12.770 --> 02:51:16.140
<v Speaker 1>They actually had a hunting episode</v>
<v Speaker 1>about catching a bears,</v>

3807
02:51:16.350 --> 02:51:20.070
<v Speaker 1>blueberry bears that come out of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>dens and just feast on these huge hills</v>

3808
02:51:20.071 --> 02:51:23.400
<v Speaker 1>of blueberries and they get fat with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>With blueberry fat.</v>

3809
02:51:23.401 --> 02:51:25.770
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing because as they're cutting</v>
<v Speaker 1>this fat off,</v>

3810
02:51:25.771 --> 02:51:29.070
<v Speaker 1>it's like a bluish fat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the dye from the blueberry actually</v>

3811
02:51:29.071 --> 02:51:31.560
<v Speaker 1>makes it into their cells.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unbelievable.</v>

3812
02:51:31.561 --> 02:51:36.561
<v Speaker 1>But it stands to reason that we are also</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we eat and if we eat a ton of</v>

3813
02:51:37.021 --> 02:51:40.770
<v Speaker 1>healthy foods that our flesh is enriched</v>
<v Speaker 1>with nutrients are,</v>

3814
02:51:40.940 --> 02:51:45.060
<v Speaker 1>our tissue is enriched with this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this purified water and these healthy</v>

3815
02:51:45.061 --> 02:51:49.470
<v Speaker 1>vegetables and good lean proteins and</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these different things that are good</v>

3816
02:51:49.471 --> 02:51:50.304
<v Speaker 1>for us.</v>

3817
02:51:50.850 --> 02:51:52.890
<v Speaker 1>If you could take that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little bit of that in pill form as</v>

3818
02:51:52.891 --> 02:51:55.140
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's a bad thing for you.</v>

3819
02:51:55.280 --> 02:51:56.310
<v Speaker 1>Like I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

3820
02:51:56.311 --> 02:51:57.930
<v Speaker 1>It's not a bad thing for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

3821
02:51:57.931 --> 02:52:01.380
<v Speaker 1>it's just almost always unnecessary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you want to lead a super</v>

3822
02:52:01.381 --> 02:52:03.990
<v Speaker 1>balanced diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if you have any kind of,</v>

3823
02:52:03.991 --> 02:52:05.950
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any kind of a diet and if you don't live</v>

3824
02:52:05.951 --> 02:52:06.784
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3825
02:52:06.820 --> 02:52:09.380
<v Speaker 1>chat or Somalia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're getting your,</v>

3826
02:52:09.390 --> 02:52:12.940
<v Speaker 1>you're doing pretty well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you think that it's not worth it.</v>

3827
02:52:12.941 --> 02:52:15.590
<v Speaker 1>Your call is that it's not worth it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the amount of money spent on</v>

3828
02:52:15.591 --> 02:52:18.250
<v Speaker 1>providing men's is pretty expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huge.</v>

3829
02:52:18.251 --> 02:52:19.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If tremendous.</v>

3830
02:52:19.520 --> 02:52:21.190
<v Speaker 1>And multivitamins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to buy the.</v>

3831
02:52:21.191 --> 02:52:24.360
<v Speaker 1>I buy these packs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these men pure packs,</v>

3832
02:52:24.361 --> 02:52:27.520
<v Speaker 1>these athlete pure packs because it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>easy for me to do and I think they're</v>

3833
02:52:27.521 --> 02:52:28.630
<v Speaker 1>called,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget what it costs.</v>

3834
02:52:29.100 --> 02:52:31.180
<v Speaker 1>It's probably like a dollar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a pill pack or something like that.</v>

3835
02:52:31.181 --> 02:52:33.100
<v Speaker 1>Maybe maybe a little bit more and over</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

3836
02:52:33.640 --> 02:52:34.241
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that could,</v>

3837
02:52:34.241 --> 02:52:35.110
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that could add up.</v>

3838
02:52:35.111 --> 02:52:37.900
<v Speaker 1>But for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think of it as a hedging my bet.</v>

3839
02:52:38.050 --> 02:52:41.020
<v Speaker 1>I want to make sure I get as much</v>
<v Speaker 1>nutrients in my body as I can.</v>

3840
02:52:41.870 --> 02:52:42.580
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot,</v>

3841
02:52:42.580 --> 02:52:45.130
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot more substantial things to</v>
<v Speaker 1>worry about in life.</v>

3842
02:52:45.160 --> 02:52:48.190
<v Speaker 1>There's also things though that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>average person doesn't need that</v>

3843
02:52:48.191 --> 02:52:50.240
<v Speaker 1>athletes do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that that's a,</v>

3844
02:52:50.260 --> 02:52:52.900
<v Speaker 1>that's another issue when it comes to</v>
<v Speaker 1>supplementation.</v>

3845
02:52:53.140 --> 02:52:55.540
<v Speaker 1>Athletes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of benefit in food and</v>

3846
02:52:55.541 --> 02:52:58.630
<v Speaker 1>supplementation now can't always have</v>
<v Speaker 1>more fluid depending on what you're in.</v>

3847
02:52:58.631 --> 02:52:59.140
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>

3848
02:52:59.140 --> 02:53:02.830
<v Speaker 1>some athletes have to watch their weight</v>
<v Speaker 1>gotta wash the girlish figure,</v>

3849
02:53:03.410 --> 02:53:06.970
<v Speaker 1>so they just need to make sure they get</v>
<v Speaker 1>some exercise to brian,</v>

3850
02:53:07.510 --> 02:53:09.950
<v Speaker 1>you and I agree on more than we disagree</v>
<v Speaker 1>or not.</v>

3851
02:53:09.960 --> 02:53:10.793
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3852
02:53:10.810 --> 02:53:13.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry if I was rough with you about</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain things like defending my friend</v>

3853
02:53:13.511 --> 02:53:14.920
<v Speaker 1>mark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if I didn't you would've fucking</v>

3854
02:53:14.921 --> 02:53:18.030
<v Speaker 1>killed me next time I saw him and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>would have to deal with glutosiome and</v>

3855
02:53:18.031 --> 02:53:20.770
<v Speaker 1>talk for an hour and a half.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want to review the tweets and how</v>

3856
02:53:20.771 --> 02:53:22.990
<v Speaker 1>many people have called me an asshole</v>
<v Speaker 1>over the.</v>

3857
02:53:23.020 --> 02:53:25.420
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he can't listen if anybody's calling</v>

3858
02:53:25.570 --> 02:53:27.280
<v Speaker 1>brian and asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not an asshole.</v>

3859
02:53:27.520 --> 02:53:30.790
<v Speaker 1>And I think that your ideas essentially</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3860
02:53:30.800 --> 02:53:32.920
<v Speaker 1>the hard stance that you take is</v>
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>

3861
02:53:32.921 --> 02:53:34.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's so much bullshit out there and I</v>

3862
02:53:34.781 --> 02:53:37.060
<v Speaker 1>think it's a good stance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the right stance most of</v>

3863
02:53:37.061 --> 02:53:38.440
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that,</v>

3864
02:53:38.680 --> 02:53:39.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by,</v>

3865
02:53:39.580 --> 02:53:44.110
<v Speaker 1>by being this hard edge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no nonsense guide though it does</v>

3866
02:53:45.310 --> 02:53:48.400
<v Speaker 1>eliminate some of the flexibility of</v>
<v Speaker 1>this world.</v>

3867
02:53:48.430 --> 02:53:51.100
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the real conspiracies are automatically</v>

3868
02:53:51.101 --> 02:53:53.140
<v Speaker 1>dismissed for the standard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3869
02:53:54.490 --> 02:53:55.330
<v Speaker 1>official report.</v>

3870
02:53:55.720 --> 02:53:58.060
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's not always good either,</v>

3871
02:53:58.390 --> 02:53:58.991
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3872
02:53:58.991 --> 02:54:03.280
<v Speaker 1>I mean the old saying extraordinary</v>
<v Speaker 1>claims need extraordinary evidence.</v>

3873
02:54:03.430 --> 02:54:05.200
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you go around and questioning,</v>

3874
02:54:05.201 --> 02:54:07.750
<v Speaker 1>you know whether this table is real or</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's an illusion,</v>

3875
02:54:07.751 --> 02:54:10.630
<v Speaker 1>obviously that's silly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you got to draw the line somewhere.</v>

3876
02:54:10.750 --> 02:54:11.990
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had dr mikhal,</v>

3877
02:54:12.050 --> 02:54:15.100
<v Speaker 1>swami theoretical physicist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he made me question everything.</v>

3878
02:54:15.640 --> 02:54:20.640
<v Speaker 1>I started talking about string theory</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the fucking particles in the state</v>

3879
02:54:21.011 --> 02:54:24.490
<v Speaker 1>of superposition where they're moving</v>
<v Speaker 1>and still at the same time they appear</v>

3880
02:54:24.491 --> 02:54:26.230
<v Speaker 1>and denny's a swami.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3881
02:54:26.231 --> 02:54:28.830
<v Speaker 1>his name is dr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>goswami.</v>

3882
02:54:28.870 --> 02:54:29.681
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>

3883
02:54:29.681 --> 02:54:32.610
<v Speaker 1>I don't get on racist dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Happens to be indian.</v>

3884
02:54:32.620 --> 02:54:34.720
<v Speaker 1>They'll come down on you hard son.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a billion of them.</v>

3885
02:54:36.070 --> 02:54:39.610
<v Speaker 1>I want to thank you for coming on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast first fall and I want to thank</v>

3886
02:54:39.611 --> 02:54:42.250
<v Speaker 1>you for just discussing all this stuff.</v>

3887
02:54:42.350 --> 02:54:43.183
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>

3888
02:54:43.190 --> 02:54:46.420
<v Speaker 1>It's fascinating and like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we agree more than we disagree</v>

3889
02:54:46.421 --> 02:54:50.260
<v Speaker 1>and I'm glad we cleared up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully some of the misconceptions</v>

3890
02:54:50.440 --> 02:54:53.920
<v Speaker 1>about how I approach things because I</v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly am easy to criticize and I'm</v>

3891
02:54:53.921 --> 02:54:58.180
<v Speaker 1>certainly easy to categorize as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot of my ridiculous comments,</v>

3892
02:54:58.181 --> 02:55:01.210
<v Speaker 1>aren't we all on various things have</v>
