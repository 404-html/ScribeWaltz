150
00:03:49.241 --> 00:03:50.890
<v Speaker 3>John Jones is a super talent man.</v>

151
00:03:50.891 --> 00:03:52.630
<v Speaker 3>He's like a Michael Jordan type character.</v>

152
00:03:52.631 --> 00:03:55.030
<v Speaker 3>They're just unbelievably physically gifted.</v>

153
00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:56.111
<v Speaker 3>Who knows,</v>

154
00:03:56.111 --> 00:03:56.590
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

156
00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.420
<v Speaker 3>My theory is that Joe Rogan always talk about the guy.</v>

157
00:04:01.421 --> 00:04:04.220
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't think he's going to win a lot more because he's got a chance.</v>

158
00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.220
<v Speaker 3>Who wants to make sure everyone knows about those chances?</v>

159
00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.490
<v Speaker 3>And you've been talking nonstop about about Shogun and how much of a killer,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Freaked out with these guys.</v>

167
00:04:16.451 --> 00:04:18.160
<v Speaker 3>Be If I just have to know and utilize models.</v>

168
00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:23.270
<v Speaker 3>They do it like it all Shogun seem right?</v>

174
00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.180
<v Speaker 3>My fucking teeth are trickling down the floor.</v>

175
00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:34.210
