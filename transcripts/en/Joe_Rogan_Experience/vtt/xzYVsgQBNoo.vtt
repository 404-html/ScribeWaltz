1
00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:02.640
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:07.540
<v 1>Now there is a,
uh,
a related disease that from cats called toxic crisis,</v>

3
00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:11.420
and that's a parasitic worm infection we're finding in the United States among

4
00:00:11.421 --> 00:00:13.440
the poor.
And that's a weren't.

5
00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:17.480
So what happens is if you go into poor neighborhoods,
you know,
and,
uh,

6
00:00:17.481 --> 00:00:20.300
you see a lot of feral cats and dogs in poor neighborhoods,

7
00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:24.410
almost a hundred percent of them have this warm in their intestines and they're

8
00:00:24.411 --> 00:00:26.720
seeding the environment with eggs in their feces.

9
00:00:26.721 --> 00:00:29.810
And the feces are spread all over the poor neighborhoods.

10
00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:32.000
Kids come into contact with him in the worm,

11
00:00:32.001 --> 00:00:36.680
has the ability to migrate through the brain across the rebuild toxic crisis.

12
00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:40.070
Um,
and I think it's an important cause of developmental delays.

13
00:00:40.071 --> 00:00:42.410
It's one of those neglected diseases among,

14
00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.830
in the u s and talk about in the book.
And there is no vaccine for that.

15
00:00:45.831 --> 00:00:49.490
He was no vaccine for it.
And we know very little awareness about it.
Wow.
Yeah.

16
00:00:49.491 --> 00:00:53.480
I've never even heard of it until just now.
So this is not rare.
I mean,

17
00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:58.310
in some cases,
you know,
up to 10% of certain populations,
like African,

18
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.040
African Americans living in poverty are infected with it.

19
00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.060
And it's primarily pets,
or does it,
is it rodents as well?

20
00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.380
Mostly stray dogs.
And it's not even pets.
It's mostly stray dogs and cats.
And,

21
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.030
and I get very,
and this is an example of a neglected tropical disease.
Here's,

22
00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.560
here's a disease of up to 10% of African Americans living in poverty in the

23
00:01:18.561 --> 00:01:22.730
United States.
And almost nobody is studying it.
Wow.
Right?

24
00:01:22.731 --> 00:01:25.010
And it can affect the way your mind functions.

25
00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:29.960
And it's been linked now to developmental delays.
So,
you know,

26
00:01:29.961 --> 00:01:31.880
everybody wants to know why,
you know,

27
00:01:31.881 --> 00:01:35.960
kids living in poverty have developmental delays and people just assume it's

28
00:01:35.961 --> 00:01:38.720
because they live in deprived environments and that sort of thing.

29
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.460
But I think toxic crisis is an important underlying reason for it.
Um,

30
00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.820
and this is an example of a neglected disease.
You know,
we,
I mean,

31
00:01:46.821 --> 00:01:50.890
everybody's heard of Ebola,
right?
And everyone's worried about Ebola and,

32
00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.960
and the truth is Ebola is never going to come to the United States.

33
00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.620
Why is it ever going to be,
cause it's too difficult to transmit.
Um,

34
00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:00.050
unless you have a complete collapse in the health system.

35
00:02:00.051 --> 00:02:03.080
We're never going to have Ebola epidemics in the United States,

36
00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:07.430
but here's a disease of 10% of African Americans living in poverty and no one's

37
00:02:07.431 --> 00:02:09.260
heard of it and there's no incentive to study it.

38
00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.520
So that's why I'm trying to raise awareness about these poverty related
diseases.

39
00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:14.900
And that's correct.
I mean,

40
00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:17.260
I don't understand why people don't talk about that one.
Yeah,

41
00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.710
that one seems insane,
right?
Yeah,
absolutely.
It's a no brainer.
Right?
And so,

42
00:02:21.711 --> 00:02:24.170
but you know,
it's very hard to get people to care.

43
00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.900
<v 0>A bunch of things happened all at once.</v>

44
00:02:27.901 --> 00:02:32.580
And this was in 2013.
Um,

45
00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.670
I didn't want to leave because I had little kids,
so I didn't want to,
I was,

46
00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.980
I was going to stay there and,
and just wither wither away.

47
00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.410
Um,
I,
I almost capitulated,
you know,
to darkness.
Uh,

48
00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.920
but I got up before I went to sleep one night,

49
00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.660
my kid is sleeping with me and I'm hammered and it's like eight at night,

50
00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.800
you know.
And,
uh,
and,
um,
I had an epiphany.
I said,
you know what?
I can't,

51
00:02:59.801 --> 00:03:04.600
I can't do this and I will not.
I remember saying this to myself,
I will not,

52
00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.750
I will not be defeated.
I will not be defeated.

53
00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:13.090
And I put my running shoes by the side of my bed and some shorts set my alarm

54
00:03:13.091 --> 00:03:13.924
clock,

55
00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:18.400
got up early next morning and went for a run I la Forrest Gump,

56
00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.890
uh,
and a pound the pavement for about 10 or 12 miles.
And I'm not a runner,

57
00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.410
you know,
I like to run.
I like to spirit.

58
00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.740
And when I came back from the run,

59
00:03:29.741 --> 00:03:33.380
worked out in my driveway for about an hour and,
uh,

60
00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.510
my local cops came all happened at the same time.
And,
uh,

61
00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.410
they came and said,
hey bro,
get the fuck out kids to be all right.

62
00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.630
You need to do this and that.
And,
um,

63
00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.820
then I started,
uh,
kind of figuring out

64
00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:56.770
re,
uh,
reevaluating my path in life.
Oh,
back up a step.

65
00:03:56.771 --> 00:04:00.700
I got also got laid off from this corporation.
And you know,

66
00:04:00.701 --> 00:04:03.820
with a guy in the military,
you don't,
you don't ever think about job security.

67
00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.721
And whenever we're tired,

68
00:04:04.721 --> 00:04:09.460
I'm working for a corporation that was mostly made up of a retired military
guys.

69
00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.490
So you get laid off and you're like,
what the fuck am I going to do now?

70
00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:17.540
What does that even mean?
Getting laid off?
I don't,
what am I going to do?
Um,

71
00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.900
so all that shit happened at the same time.
It was like a,

72
00:04:19.901 --> 00:04:24.901
it was like this massive spiral of bad events and a man I was able to,

73
00:04:28.691 --> 00:04:29.524
um,

74
00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:34.330
I was able to rekindle my own,

75
00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:39.040
my own,
my own fire because I recognize,
all right bro,
you still got an amber,

76
00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.510
you still got this.
All you need to do is just nurture that amber,

77
00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:43.600
turn it into a flame,

78
00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:48.730
turn that into a flame and then just start adding would add would add wood until

79
00:04:48.731 --> 00:04:53.230
it becomes just a perpetual
blaze.

80
00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:57.550
And which led me to this thing that I tell people now,
you know,
is that,
uh,

81
00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.410
you got to keep the blaze alive.
Um,

82
00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:03.880
I've got that on t shirts even because I,
I like,

83
00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:10.260
I like to kick people in the ass who are willing to sustain their own fire once

84
00:05:11.471 --> 00:05:15.580
they get that ass kicking.
If they can't,

85
00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:20.470
if they can't keep their fire going and it's not worth,
it's not worth it for me,

86
00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:24.250
you know,
to,
to keep kicking them in the ass.
Um,

87
00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.810
but,
uh,
uh,
yeah,

88
00:05:28.811 --> 00:05:33.811
so ever since that point in time and you know,

89
00:05:34.721 --> 00:05:38.350
getting laid off the depression,
the booze,
and,
uh,

90
00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:44.010
I was able to read,
discover me and rebrand and,
and,
um,

91
00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:46.810
pretty much start from scratch.
I mean,

92
00:05:46.811 --> 00:05:51.610
I had to start life all over again when I was 48 years old.
Wow.

93
00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:56.830
Have the whole thing from scratch.
I think that the idea that this was just some,

94
00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:00.110
<v 2>um,
is just not,</v>

95
00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:05.180
it doesn't respect the significance of what they were trying to do and how

96
00:06:06.711 --> 00:06:10.580
effective that they were with these other things where even if they're just

97
00:06:10.581 --> 00:06:13.550
trying it out just a little bit,
just working to see what works.

98
00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:15.170
They're always experimenting.

99
00:06:15.171 --> 00:06:19.100
They're always trying to find ways to create that tension.
Um,

100
00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:22.340
and that's the thing that I think is so interesting about this,
right?

101
00:06:22.341 --> 00:06:26.870
This evolving,
this idea of an information war where these tactics evolve.

102
00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:28.040
Um,

103
00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:31.640
and you are really at a disadvantage when it comes to actually detecting them.

104
00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:36.920
<v 3>One of the things about hunter that's really intoxicating is that his sort of</v>

105
00:06:37.711 --> 00:06:42.711
self destructive path becomes romantic when you read it and you get involved in

106
00:06:43.411 --> 00:06:46.890
his work and you kind of mimic it,
you know,
it's,
uh,

107
00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:48.810
that's the greatest fallacy I think.

108
00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:53.010
I think what he was trying to say with self destruction was that this wasn't an

109
00:06:53.011 --> 00:06:56.490
incredible threat to our American democracy.
Not,
I don't mean that.
I mean,

110
00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:00.570
I mean his,
no romanticism tilling his,
well,
I mean,
there,

111
00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:04.620
the romantic aspect of it was,
it,
his work was fantastic.

112
00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:08.480
I mean,
window was till it wasn't,
it was fantastic till it wasn't,

113
00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:13.200
wasn't he understood he was within the physio.
It was,
but he lived in with,

114
00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:18.210
he spent much more time within the consequences of that bingeing than he did

115
00:07:18.211 --> 00:07:20.190
within the success of the bingeing.
Right.

116
00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:23.370
And that I think he knew that it is letters.

117
00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:27.000
It's really beautiful and heartbreaking and in his riding too,

118
00:07:27.001 --> 00:07:30.330
I mean I think that's what's been missed about him is there's no romanticism and

119
00:07:30.331 --> 00:07:32.640
self destruction right towards the end.

120
00:07:32.641 --> 00:07:36.570
He definitely lost his productivity and Yon Warner talked about that and the

121
00:07:36.571 --> 00:07:40.440
Alex give me documentary.
He just,
sticky fingers was a great,
the document I,

122
00:07:40.441 --> 00:07:44.420
the new book on the New Book on Yon Winner has great moments of Thompson,

123
00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:47.790
the 70s just being kind of lost.
Yeah,
I think,

124
00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:52.140
I think we got to remember that we have an incredible times in American history.

125
00:07:52.141 --> 00:07:55.490
We have times that are going to burn brightly and it's up to each rider to

126
00:07:55.491 --> 00:07:58.470
decide how they'd like to burn next to it.
And if you're going to burn brightly,

127
00:07:58.471 --> 00:08:00.150
they may not have other times.

128
00:08:00.151 --> 00:08:03.780
And that's I think an American thing where you can wager that bright flame,

129
00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:05.820
which means you may have nothing left afterwards,

130
00:08:05.821 --> 00:08:09.970
but Thompson knew that he may have to live in that kind of afterlife.

131
00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:13.440
I want one.
Thompson writes about it so beautifully.
Yeah.
Stories.

132
00:08:13.441 --> 00:08:18.360
I tell myself there's some,
some footage of him when he was writing for,

133
00:08:18.361 --> 00:08:22.530
I forget what newspaper someone was it somewhere in the Pacific northwest.

134
00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:27.510
What,
what was your writing for?
Who is the author of playing off the rail?

135
00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:32.490
D Google,
uh,
playing off the rail.
There's a guy who was a journalist,

136
00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:36.900
but year,
do you think it was David Mccumber?
Yes.
David McCumber,

137
00:08:36.901 --> 00:08:40.350
Dave and Macomber employed hunter for awhile when David was,
um,

138
00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:42.860
I forget what publication he was working for,

139
00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:46.220
but there's some footage of them community communicating together and,
you know,

140
00:08:46.221 --> 00:08:49.870
just trying to get hunter in San Francisco was in San Francisco and hunter's

141
00:08:49.871 --> 00:08:53.250
just out of his fucking mind.
I mean,
it was younger.

142
00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:56.940
You mean he wasn't even that old,
but he was just,
he just couldn't communicate.

143
00:08:56.941 --> 00:08:59.970
He couldn't talk.
And,
uh,
you know,
he made a beat.

144
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.120
He and makes the beast have you escape the pain of articulation.

145
00:09:03.121 --> 00:09:06.360
You escape the pain of saying this is what's wrong in American society.

146
00:09:06.361 --> 00:09:07.860
For him to say the way he did,

147
00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:11.790
one of his great essay is this from 1964 is by going to Hemingway's.
Um,

148
00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:16.130
Ketchum Idaho on grave and Hemingway's house and it,

149
00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:20.010
it's gorgeous because it talks about Hemingway was a good writer,

150
00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:24.150
one of the best writers when he was writing about an up period,

151
00:09:24.151 --> 00:09:27.480
he understood the 1940 [inaudible] 1930s when there was a firmness to the

152
00:09:27.481 --> 00:09:29.430
reality that he could articulate.

153
00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:32.070
One of the writers goals is to give a pattern to chaos,

154
00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:33.290
is to give an articulation to cast.

155
00:09:33.291 --> 00:09:37.410
But what happens in the 1960s when the chaos is multiplying repeatedly,

156
00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:40.230
somebody like Hemingway becomes a literal relic.

157
00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:44.010
Like his narrative no longer fits into the present that he's in.

158
00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:48.190
And Thompson saw Hemingway's decline and he wrote about Hemingway's.
Um,

159
00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:49.950
suicide by me,

160
00:09:49.951 --> 00:09:54.270
by his narrative doesn't fit Hemingway's idea of what America was and what a man

161
00:09:54.271 --> 00:09:58.680
should be fit perfectly with what I think the twenties to the forties when we

162
00:09:58.681 --> 00:09:59.221
experienced.

163
00:09:59.221 --> 00:10:02.850
But I think in the early 1960s with our social upheaval of civil rights,
of,
um,

164
00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:06.840
you know,
political upheaval,
Hemingway,
it was confusing to him.
It didn't,

165
00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:08.090
it didn't fit anymore.

166
00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:11.430
Like his way of operating no longer articulated the presence.

167
00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:15.780
And so Hemingway's last act was to take away his ability to say anything at all.

168
00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:18.940
That was his only.
The last thing I ever said was to say,

169
00:10:18.941 --> 00:10:20.400
I'm not going to say anything anymore,

170
00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:24.450
was the suicide that Hemingway committed and Thompson wrote about that
cordially.

171
00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:29.750
<v 4>The only problem with those gals is that there is a reality to certain levels of</v>

172
00:10:30.811 --> 00:10:35.811
musculature that most likely they're only achieved by injecting male hormones so

173
00:10:37.141 --> 00:10:41.100
that the clits kind of get big or whatever.
But can you tell?
No,

174
00:10:41.101 --> 00:10:44.780
but I feel like we should bro.
There's a dick on inside and nut.

175
00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:47.160
Get that one down there.

176
00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:54.900
Yeah.
That's what happens.
It's not real.
It is real.
It is real way.
No,
no,
no,

177
00:10:54.901 --> 00:10:59.280
it is no way.
How about that one in the lower right hand,
upper right hand corner,

178
00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:04.170
the dark one.
Jamie.
Below that.
That one.
Pow.
How'd you like me now?

179
00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:09.060
That's a Dick Balls.
Yeah.
No,
no.
That's pussy lips,
bro.
That's not,

180
00:11:09.061 --> 00:11:13.120
that's not how,
that's Pussy Lips,
Doug.
Okay.
See Lips.

181
00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:16.140
Now that one down there.
What about the giant one below that?

182
00:11:16.141 --> 00:11:19.930
Jamie did the one in the middle.
What's happening there,
Bro,

183
00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:21.570
that just looks like a witch finger

184
00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:28.870
is gnarly,
man.
That's Photoshop has to be from my shit,
dude.

185
00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:33.950
Dude.
This is might be hermaphrodite free porn.
Mm.

186
00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:39.240
Yeah.
Oh,
dude.
Well,

187
00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:44.040
when girls take a lot of testosterone,
they do develop enlarge clits.

188
00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:47.910
There was a,
a,
a show on HBO back in the day,

189
00:11:47.911 --> 00:11:52.330
I think it was called private dicks,
but it was like that girl's Jack.

190
00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:55.690
You're into into that though?
No,
that's a little much.
Yeah.

191
00:11:56.330 --> 00:11:59.890
Dillashaw yeah,
that's Lerer pretty looking now.

192
00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:04.870
She wasn't flux and told to eat a couple of sandwiches.
All right.
Well anyway,

193
00:12:04.871 --> 00:12:08.290
let's get out of there.
That's,
that's enough.
We're going to start vomiting mood.

194
00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:12.940
I mean,
it gets to a certain size where that's like,

195
00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:15.930
it's wrapped around her leg and tied in a bow.
You're like,
hey,

196
00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:19.480
or you gotta like kind of like push it to the side to insert.

197
00:12:20.830 --> 00:12:24.550
You gotta hold it like a handle all your bad choice.

198
00:12:25.650 --> 00:12:29.980
Fuck you.
It's like the tones,
the reins on a horse.

199
00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:33.230
Like you're hanging onto it.
Where are you bang on it.
Oh,

200
00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:36.070
<v 5>okay.</v>
