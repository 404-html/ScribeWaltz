WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.000
What should we talk about?

2
00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:11.440
I guess bodies.
Terrible.
Yes.

3
00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.430
I'm glad we missed that whole blue.

4
00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:19.380
Oh,
what's up everybody?

5
00:00:19.381 --> 00:00:22.710
It's a Brendan shop and Joe Rogan and Whoa.

6
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.790
This is the fight companion light is to tell the slimmed down version.

7
00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.970
Eddie Bravo is doing a Jujitsu seminar today in I think in Whittier and uh,

8
00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.410
Brian Cowan is in Utah tending to play golf with his dad.
Yeah.

9
00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.240
He plays golf and he acts like he enjoys it.
Papa doesn't really.

10
00:00:42.241 --> 00:00:45.780
Yeah,
that's right.
I think he kind of likes it,
but he,
you know,
he can't go.
Wow.

11
00:00:45.781 --> 00:00:47.250
He probably just likes hanging out with his dad.

12
00:00:47.251 --> 00:00:50.830
You've got to do things like that.
You do,
man.
Yeah,
I mean checks.

13
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.090
Pretend to be in the football so can hang out with you.
That's true.

14
00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:59.020
Someone to actually get into it.
I'm just being offensive.
So Brian,

15
00:00:59.021 --> 00:01:03.490
Barbara Arena and uh,
who's the other gentleman?
Something.
Edwards Edwards.

16
00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.330
What's his,
uh,
do we have a fight card?

17
00:01:06.331 --> 00:01:10.140
Jamie could put that shit up on the other screen and this UFC Rotterdam reminds

18
00:01:10.141 --> 00:01:14.430
me of UFC 100.
This thing is epic.
How dare you show up late Joe Rogan.

19
00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.050
It's a lease that rest in shape.
Yeah,
it's,

20
00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:27.900
it's about as good as shape as you can get beer.
Rapido it clipped Brian.

21
00:01:27.901 --> 00:01:31.950
Barbarian is the dude who choked out.
Sage Northcutt very tough fighter.

22
00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:34.980
Leeanne Edwards.
That's right.
Leon got,

23
00:01:34.981 --> 00:01:37.650
there's not a lot of Leon's left in the world is,
that's right man.

24
00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.440
You met dude.
That was a big name in the 70s.
You had no guy.
Oh,

25
00:01:43.441 --> 00:01:48.120
he's got the back one hook.
Brian Barberino is very good on she ground.

26
00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.850
Interesting.
Do you see the fire man?

27
00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:58.650
See that fire last night?
Where was it?
Cause I woke up my,
my,
my uh,

28
00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.120
my slingshot was all covered in ash.
Isn't that crazy?
Yeah,

29
00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.690
it's out near Burbank.
Is it really?
Yeah.

30
00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:09.090
It's already the biggest fire in the history of California.

31
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:14.040
Los Angeles Rather.
Yeah,
because it's in Los Angeles County.

32
00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.440
It's the biggest fire ever in Los Angeles County.

33
00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.130
I think it's burned something like 5,000 acres are ready and our people

34
00:02:20.131 --> 00:02:22.800
evacuating their homes and shit and they were in danger.
They,

35
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.420
they're evacuated in Burbank.
Burbank.
But a good chunk,
Tim.

36
00:02:27.421 --> 00:02:31.260
I've seen any of the news.
Gary coming home looking up the highway.

37
00:02:31.261 --> 00:02:34.460
When you see the hills on fire.
Really?
Damn.
That's scary.

38
00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.710
It's kind of close to you.
No,
no.
It's not close to me,

39
00:02:37.711 --> 00:02:41.100
but I can see it from some sponsor closer.

40
00:02:41.101 --> 00:02:43.950
It's close to a Brian red band.
He lives out there.

41
00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:48.990
Look at that fast moving while evacuated in la in Burbank.

42
00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.890
You know,
I talked to a fireman wants man,
he fucking freaked me out.
He goes,

43
00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.970
it's just a matter of time until one day it burns all the way the water.

44
00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.710
And I went,
what?
And he goes,
Yep.
Just a of time.
One day.
Oh Brian,
Barbara.

45
00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.400
And I'm like,
he fucked her.
Oh No,

46
00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:06.640
you just stay on that opposite hand.
Yeah,

47
00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.700
I'll just give him get his chin broke.
Yeah,
that opposite hands.

48
00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.360
Firefighter sounds like a drama queen.
No,
no,
no.

49
00:03:13.361 --> 00:03:17.980
He said they're east coast with the right combination of dry weather and the

50
00:03:17.981 --> 00:03:21.760
right wind and he goes,
once it hits the buildings,
we won't be able to stop it.

51
00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:25.030
He see those little burn all the way to the water?
No,

52
00:03:25.031 --> 00:03:27.730
he was an older dude that was like super stoic.

53
00:03:27.731 --> 00:03:31.180
That's why it made me shit my pants.
Really?
Yeah.
It wasn't like some Dork.

54
00:03:31.181 --> 00:03:35.020
Let's talk slash math man.
Have you ever seen,
you know,
the,
uh,
new papers on top?

55
00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:39.820
Oh Shit Dude.
He's under the chin.
Yeah,
he's in trouble now.
Oh,
ah,
sideways.

56
00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.850
Sideways.
He's okay.
Leon's definitely doing work.
Yeah.

57
00:03:42.851 --> 00:03:47.020
Leanne almost had that if he maintained back control,
they're like,

58
00:03:47.021 --> 00:03:50.170
if he had a like some Marcello Garcia style hooks,

59
00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:52.720
Goddamn you might've got that back.

60
00:03:52.721 --> 00:03:57.460
That firefighter hitting on are scary as fuck.
He was.
All he was saying was,

61
00:03:57.461 --> 00:04:01.000
he goes,
there's only so much we can do when a fire,

62
00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.540
it gets out of control with strong wind and dry ground.
He don't like,

63
00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:07.600
this was right after,
I don't know if you around,
um,

64
00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:13.300
California in 2002,
I think somewhere around there,

65
00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:18.270
2000,
2003,
I got evacuated.
Um,
and uh,

66
00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:22.630
we were coming home from fear factor.
We're filming out in uh,

67
00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:27.660
like north up on the five and as I was coming home for a whole hour on the right

68
00:04:28.041 --> 00:04:29.230
hand side of the car,

69
00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:34.350
the hills run fire that whole hour in the car driving personally in other years,

70
00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:37.300
like your old house like out there?
Yeah.
No,

71
00:04:37.301 --> 00:04:40.900
but I'm just saying on the way home from like to hone,
you know,

72
00:04:40.901 --> 00:04:42.040
like to hone ranch.

73
00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.630
The whole right side of the highway was on fire for an hour.

74
00:04:46.631 --> 00:04:51.460
That's how much was on fire.
I'm talking like 50 miles of shit on fire.

75
00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:54.580
I got never seen anything like in my life and when I was talking,

76
00:04:54.581 --> 00:04:57.410
I mean it was like Lord of the rings type Shit was crazy scary.

77
00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:58.930
All the hills were on fire.

78
00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.980
I mean every of the right hand side and everywhere you go it was like snow fall

79
00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:03.760
with ash saw dead guy.

80
00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.540
So I dude got hit by a car I was trying to run across the road and he got

81
00:05:07.541 --> 00:05:10.750
clipped.
Yeah,
there's a fire and your flat,
Gosh,
Shit.
Yeah.

82
00:05:10.751 --> 00:05:13.630
We saw this dude laid out with his sneaker off and I was like,

83
00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:17.020
oh no kind of sneaker with Reba.
I don't remember.

84
00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:22.390
You would know.
I would know Lumas those 13th

85
00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:30.220
13th you imagine like God,
they look fresh down like he's not going to be gravel.

86
00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:31.690
It's what they did in the old west days.

87
00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:33.820
Hopefully they're not at Murphy's Cathleen Hubbard.

88
00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.840
He wasn't close enough to the fire.
He was just on the highway.

89
00:05:37.841 --> 00:05:39.910
But I think you know,
people panic.

90
00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:43.400
Both the driver and the guy tried to run across the borough.

91
00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:47.350
Can you imagine the kid,
could there be a worst way to go?
Burned alive?

92
00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:50.290
Like I was watching game of Thrones.
I'm on season five now.

93
00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:54.380
When they burn homeboy,
don't say anything.
Spoiler,
it's been out way too long.

94
00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:57.940
Coils come on.
It's the best show ever.
Forever

95
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:01.310
<v 1>take gets better.
Seven the way season seven ends,</v>

96
00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:04.140
you're going to be like when the last episodes over and the goal is to black.

97
00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:08.810
You can go,
no
dude.
Oh,

98
00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:14.120
I make myself a little drink.
Such a good show.
It's so good.
Such a season five.

99
00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:18.200
Yeah,
it's so good.
The new narco started and I just,
I can't do it,
man.

100
00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:20.150
I'm crushing hard on game of Thrones,

101
00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:24.200
so I don't want to like cheat on and watch Norcos I had abandoned narco second

102
00:06:24.201 --> 00:06:27.860
season.
Why?
Um,
Coldwell and that's all.
I don't watch it by myself.

103
00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:31.910
My wife was like too many people getting shot.
Too many people get shot.

104
00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:35.700
It's my cartels.
Shit went to murder sometimes because she's cool.

105
00:06:35.701 --> 00:06:40.190
Like game of Thrones.
It's fake.
I mean,

106
00:06:40.191 --> 00:06:44.210
the only thing faker the dragons,
everything else pretty legit.
It's fake.

107
00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:48.500
Even that's up for debate.
You know what's bad ass Ozark?
I'm on season one.

108
00:06:48.501 --> 00:06:51.870
He told me that I need to get to that episode to rather episode two of Ozark.

109
00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:55.760
God Damn.
It's good.
Damn.
Your wife won't fuck with Nok Cause,
Huh?
Not Anymore.

110
00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:58.880
I can't do two shows at once.
I'm like,
I don't want to,
you know,
like I said,

111
00:06:58.881 --> 00:07:00.170
I'm crushing hard and game of Thrones.

112
00:07:00.171 --> 00:07:03.680
I don't cheat on with narcos and I can only handle so much narrative.

113
00:07:03.681 --> 00:07:06.480
You know what I'm saying?
She barely got through season one and season two.

114
00:07:06.481 --> 00:07:11.270
It was just way too much.
Merkin I mean it's,
I get it,
but it's like drug cartels.

115
00:07:11.271 --> 00:07:15.530
That's what they do is what they do.
That's also real life.
It's real life.

116
00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:19.880
Know how much they embellished.
Not much.
If you know,

117
00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:23.120
if you look at the history books with boy,
he was definitely a bad guy.

118
00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:25.070
Hirable person.
But you are rooting for me.

119
00:07:25.071 --> 00:07:26.840
Knocked cause one I was like I hope he gets out.

120
00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:31.580
I like his posture was belly and it just didn't give us fuck and we just give

121
00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:36.080
zero fucks.
Zero your show rich and just hooking up with chicks.
Non Stop.

122
00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:39.950
How about when they blew up the federal building or whatever the fuck when they

123
00:07:39.951 --> 00:07:44.440
bought the plane just he just blew up the plane and fucked everybody like no,

124
00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:46.680
fuck it.
Fuck it.
And then he ran for what?

125
00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:49.430
He ran for governor and just start killing everyone.

126
00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:56.420
I think he's Brazilian.
Brazilian.
Yeah.
It's fucking good.
He's good,

127
00:07:56.421 --> 00:08:00.080
right?
Fuck yeah.
And the new season's about the Cali cartel,
right?
Oh Man.

128
00:08:00.081 --> 00:08:00.914
I don't even want to know.

129
00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:04.850
I just feel bad that they're not gonna keep Pablo Escobar round.

130
00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:07.160
They need to like go like have a Prequel,

131
00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:10.490
like you know what they do with star wars.
Oh,
I'm,
yeah,
I'm about that.

132
00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.760
I would say jump on into that El Chapo life.

133
00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:18.230
Look at Mr. Steal your girl face there.
Would you like a mansion?

134
00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:23.210
That dude had so much money.
He had a burry it.
Yeah,
and he was like,

135
00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:24.860
he was losing money cause the wrath,

136
00:08:24.861 --> 00:08:29.660
we're fucking with the money or eaten his money like $1 million straight up.

137
00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:31.550
That's how rich you are when rat,

138
00:08:31.551 --> 00:08:35.090
they're fucking up your funds and you don't give a fuck.

139
00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:39.050
He was making too much money.
Like literally he had hippos and Shit.
Yeah.

140
00:08:39.051 --> 00:08:42.230
I'd fly him out there and just watch them attack each other and shit.

141
00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:46.980
But then he was like a great dad.
Do you see that document on his son?
No.

142
00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:49.220
Hit to change his name.
Oh my God.
Yeah,

143
00:08:49.221 --> 00:08:51.290
because his last name is Escobar and he's like,

144
00:08:51.291 --> 00:08:54.680
he's like apologizing for his dad.

145
00:08:54.681 --> 00:08:57.820
Just to own it.

146
00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:04.130
Could you imagine if your dad was Pablo Escobar means can say you're fucking

Just Viagra and different drugs that make you grow calm.

166
00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:50.340
We have this new thing.
It's a mixture of zinc,
magnesium,

167
00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:54.720
steroids,

You're framed in the nipples up

179
00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:45.060
like the chest burster an alien one.

180
00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:53.980
No,
he sees all you see is like

181
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:56.620
<v 0>fucking painted red fingernails pulling on</v>

182
00:11:58.530 --> 00:12:01.510
America's fucked up with that wall.
I'm telling you guys,

183
00:12:01.511 --> 00:12:05.290
they're not going to ease up on me either and you are not going to make Mexico

184
00:12:05.291 --> 00:12:09.730
pay for this wall.
Mr. Trump,
senior Trump senior Trump.

185
00:12:10.490 --> 00:12:15.310
Oh,
it's just the time of my life.
Hopefully fucking seal team six.

186
00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:19.600
Save me
boys.
Please,
please stick around for awhile.

187
00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:23.540
To my man,
they're grilling steaks.

188
00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:25.690
Want to make sure you're

189
00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:29.830
still killing it.

190
00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:35.250
He just making babies make this like the opposite of like when a viking comes to

191
00:12:35.741 --> 00:12:40.420
town and he didn't want to have got their own way
they want to recruit.

192
00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:44.350
It's just a dick.
All the girls down.
Yeah.
Like for real.

193
00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:47.770
If you were that dude like the mountain,

194
00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:50.820
that mountain guy from game of Thrones.
Yeah.

195
00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:55.390
I guarantee that guy could sell his calm.
This is the thing though.

196
00:12:55.391 --> 00:12:58.720
Have you seen him?
I hear you.
Have you seen him before?

197
00:12:58.721 --> 00:13:02.680
He fucking took all the Jews.
He was a basketball player.
He was skinny as fuck.

198
00:13:02.890 --> 00:13:07.210
His genes aren't that great.
It's the juice.
Oh really?
Bringing that up.

199
00:13:07.211 --> 00:13:12.160
Bring that shit up Jamie.
If he can.
Yeah,
he was a basketball player.
Look at them.

200
00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:16.510
Look at them now like he was like a giant basketball player.

201
00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:21.290
But what is he like 17 there?
How old is not a bitches these 30 though?
See

202
00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:28.300
Jamie.
Right?
But is there any other pictures of him?
Look,

203
00:13:28.301 --> 00:13:32.680
21 and 25 on the right.
Look at that little bitch.

204
00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:36.190
What's going on with his eyes?
A couple of crazy eyes.
Somebody left.

205
00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:40.750
You says genetics aren't amazing.
Wow,
that's crazy.

206
00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:46.810
That's,
that is a strong juice appetite.
Steroids.
Hell of a drug.

207
00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:51.340
God Damn.
Did you see that dude that just died?
That rich.
Wow,

208
00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:54.700
Leon's got it back again.
But this time he learned from his past mistake.
Oh,

209
00:13:54.701 --> 00:13:58.240
Leon got to.
Yeah,
I've got the,
uh,
you've got the body triangle.
He's done.

210
00:13:58.450 --> 00:14:02.950
He's done this rough,
just gut hanging over everybody.
Bob.
Bob Arena is so tough.

211
00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:06.850
Damn smart.
Worried doesn't give a fuck body lock on the,

212
00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:09.910
that's a dude that knows how to train hard.

213
00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:13.780
You know those dudes that can just train through nice toenails bro.
Oh,

214
00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:17.710
that's supposed to grab the cage,
sir.
Sir.
Stop grabbing the cage.
It's toenails.

215
00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:22.150
Yeah.
And then where is it?
You can grab the cage with your toes.

216
00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:25.290
That's a weird one,
right?
It is a strange one.
And they freak out about,

217
00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:28.330
I feel like they see that more often than the hand grab.
Oh yeah.
For sure.

218
00:14:28.450 --> 00:14:30.910
But some people let it go.
Like that guy just let it go while Leon,

219
00:14:30.911 --> 00:14:34.500
it's still working it man.
But he's not really that close.
Is he like the,

220
00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:37.420
the chin?
Well it depends on what kind of squeezed he's got it.

221
00:14:37.421 --> 00:14:39.890
He's got one of them.
Damien.
Why Maya squeezes.
Yeah,

222
00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:43.450
game over to stay with my on your neck.
Like just doesn't have enough power.

223
00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:45.700
I mean literally it's like Torque and power at this point.

224
00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:49.800
Like if [inaudible] gets a hold of you or,
or Marcello,
you know,

225
00:14:49.890 --> 00:14:51.590
joc array of pop your head off.
Oh yeah.

226
00:14:51.591 --> 00:14:56.591
If he gets this like kind of under your Chin and you're in this position was get

227
00:14:56.631 --> 00:15:00.090
the body lark.
Barberino smart though.
Leaning on that one side.

228
00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:02.260
[inaudible] get out to those.
I turn around lunch,

229
00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:04.930
he's going to end up in guard like he's going to the college.

230
00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:08.630
Get our Sel Leon control the arm that was very smart.

231
00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:12.500
Controlled that right arm with a double double risk rock.
That's a move.

232
00:15:12.501 --> 00:15:17.270
You hardly ever see the reverse armbar yet.

233
00:15:17.310 --> 00:15:18.740
Very rarely do you ever see that.

234
00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:23.740
Be kind of be a bit of a meathead to really submit somewhere that [inaudible]

235
00:15:24.170 --> 00:15:25.520
though.
Or does it like a strain?

236
00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:29.570
You know the last time we saw it ready for this hoists,
Gracie and Matt Hughes,

237
00:15:29.690 --> 00:15:34.460
God who's got a hoist Gracie's arm and that fucking stay girl.
Double risk.

238
00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:37.430
Armbar think that's how he got them right.
You'd have,

239
00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:41.290
you'd have to surprise the shit out of somebody or they have some patents,

240
00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:45.320
some cranky power.
Boom.
Matt Hughes is just got that crazy farmer.

241
00:15:45.321 --> 00:15:47.900
Gorilla strength.
How bad.
But also technique too.

242
00:15:47.950 --> 00:15:51.350
And then he just took his back and just smashed him.
How about he's doing better?

243
00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:55.250
Yeah.
You see him?
She was going to get Sushi and shit.
Yeah.
Well he's rolling.

244
00:15:55.490 --> 00:15:58.760
He's actually rolling with his friend.
They like,
he was in his guard working.

245
00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.120
I asked.
That's crazy.
Last pap milicic about it.
Cause I,
you know,

246
00:16:02.121 --> 00:16:04.850
I didn't know and asked him,
he was just saying how,
you know,

247
00:16:04.851 --> 00:16:08.950
trains the denial and they're like so far away and if you wait for him,

248
00:16:08.951 --> 00:16:12.680
you're going to be there forever.
So Matt was like,
fuck this and Florida's truck.

249
00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:16.640
But the gravel,
it didn't go like you thought it was gonna take off.

250
00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:21.380
And that's how I got hit by the train.
Oh my God.
I know that it's so crazy,

251
00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:24.560
but doing better now.
Yeah.

252
00:16:24.561 --> 00:16:27.650
Well probably because he's such gorilla,
you know,

253
00:16:27.651 --> 00:16:31.010
I'm sure that body such in phenomenal shape.
If you were like this Raf,

254
00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:35.600
you'd be dead.
Yeah.
Be Over.
He'd be over.
Yeah.
Shade me.

255
00:16:35.601 --> 00:16:40.100
He's just a tough son of a bitch.
You have to know to be a ref.
God,

256
00:16:40.101 --> 00:16:43.910
I don't feel like,
well,
there's a c there's,
there's levels to this game.

257
00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:48.080
There's big John,
there's of Dean and then it falls off like a motherfucker.

258
00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:49.790
It's kind of like the light heavyweight division.

259
00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:55.070
There's like two bad asses than the rest.
Well,
there's other really good ones.

260
00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:58.810
You know who's a really good one?
Um,
oh shit.
Damn.

261
00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:02.360
So this is an interesting fight,
right?
Because Leon had his back twice,

262
00:17:02.361 --> 00:17:04.110
two rounds in a row.
[inaudible]

263
00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:07.430
Leon came close to choke him but didn't finish him.

264
00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:09.380
Leon definitely won the fight,

265
00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:13.490
but there was at one time try and almost put them away.
It's not 10,
eight though,

266
00:17:13.491 --> 00:17:14.990
is it?
I don't know,
man.

267
00:17:14.991 --> 00:17:17.870
What are these new rules and when are we going to use them universally?

268
00:17:17.871 --> 00:17:21.710
And you're in Rotterdam.
Hey,
we got two super important things to talk about.

269
00:17:21.711 --> 00:17:26.460
One does this Jon Jones thing,
people keep saying that Jon Jones,
um,

270
00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:28.830
because of this drug tasks,

271
00:17:28.831 --> 00:17:32.450
he did a a a blood test and he did tested negative,

272
00:17:32.451 --> 00:17:35.930
the blood test tech and tested negative past the blood tests failed the urine

273
00:17:35.931 --> 00:17:39.260
test.
Here's the thing,
the,
the blood test doesn't test for that stuff.
Correct.

274
00:17:39.261 --> 00:17:41.660
I'm getting it straight from the Wicki.
Oh,
you talked to her.

275
00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:43.400
Do you talk to the Golden Snitch task?

276
00:17:43.401 --> 00:17:47.240
Because they can talk about it because John has gone public.
What?
Correct.

277
00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:52.890
The blood test is not test for this tee ball stuff,
whatever the phone call.

278
00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:55.200
But the urine test does.
Correct.

279
00:17:55.290 --> 00:18:00.000
So they have to urine samples and then the results of the urine sample B will be

280
00:18:00.001 --> 00:18:02.490
out soon.
And then we'll know what game changer.

281
00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:07.170
And he said with Toronto Ball,
it's so old school,

282
00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:08.370
like if you're going to do that,

283
00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:13.080
you basically whoever's giving it to them has their black belt in a pds.

284
00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:14.910
So if you test positive for Toronto Ball,

285
00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:17.910
you're probably stat they miss the good stuff because you're stacking that with

286
00:18:17.911 --> 00:18:18.780
a bunch of other shit.

287
00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:22.320
It's not like just can take some old school tran and ball and not take anything

288
00:18:22.321 --> 00:18:26.270
else.
This is so crazy.
How weird is it so crazy?
Cause I did not,
if,

289
00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:30.600
if this is true,
I did not think that he was a cheater.

290
00:18:31.130 --> 00:18:35.550
Really thought that he was a guy who was fucking off and partying and got busted

291
00:18:35.551 --> 00:18:38.960
with some freak shit that sends some Dick Pills because they tested those high

292
00:18:38.970 --> 00:18:42.070
number of tea.
I never bought that narrative.
Here's two options,
right?

293
00:18:42.110 --> 00:18:43.980
There's two options when it comes to those Dick Pills.

294
00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:47.970
Those Dick Pills did have the steroids in them.

295
00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:51.780
But do you know that?
Why are you taking them?

296
00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:54.480
Because if you just take them and you're getting steroids too,

297
00:18:54.750 --> 00:18:56.070
you're getting steroids and your Dick,

298
00:18:56.071 --> 00:18:58.170
but not enough where it's gonna be a performance.
Hank Lake,

299
00:18:58.171 --> 00:19:01.800
it's such a small micro dose of uh,
testosterone.

300
00:19:01.801 --> 00:19:04.860
Where the fuck is in those things?
He gets a clomiphene,
right?
Yeah,

301
00:19:04.861 --> 00:19:09.390
whatever it is.
But I just,
I,
I think John has some smart people around him.

302
00:19:09.391 --> 00:19:11.850
They painted that narrative where like,
oh yeah,
he's a party.

303
00:19:11.851 --> 00:19:13.500
He was taking Dick Pills.
That makes sense.

304
00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:16.920
Why you would test positive for this stuff?
When I feel like the recipe,

305
00:19:16.921 --> 00:19:18.930
when the know were like,
uh,

306
00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:22.900
not really well like this monster be taken.

307
00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:24.390
I get you dick people down.

308
00:19:24.391 --> 00:19:29.310
If Dick people down in my day before to never have to fucking turn towards Dick

309
00:19:29.310 --> 00:19:31.680
Pills.
You know what I was like,
I like to party as much as the next day.

310
00:19:31.770 --> 00:19:34.930
Not John Jones.
There's levels to this party game that Jon Jones style.

311
00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:38.150
Well he obviously had coconut system too.
He does like to party for real.

312
00:19:38.151 --> 00:19:38.984
We get that.

313
00:19:39.090 --> 00:19:42.600
And then that's what you know Brian Red band called it because people that do

314
00:19:42.601 --> 00:19:46.920
coke,
the Dick doesn't work that good.
So then they stack it well with,

315
00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:50.990
with a vacuum.
It's Dick.
And I was like really?
And he was telling me about,

316
00:19:50.991 --> 00:19:54.060
cause Brian loves those God damn gas station Dick Pills,
but he's like,

317
00:19:54.061 --> 00:19:56.190
they're totally inconsistent.
He's like,
you'll get one,

318
00:19:56.191 --> 00:19:58.110
you get these raging hard ons,
you get another one,

319
00:19:58.230 --> 00:20:01.820
you feel like a homicidal maniac.
Like you,
you get crazy aggressive.

320
00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:06.510
Don't want that in my life.
You know what I'm saying?
But I see,
I just,

321
00:20:06.511 --> 00:20:10.450
I never bought that narrative with John.
I did it.
Well,
now we know.
You know the,

322
00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:15.460
the urine test from a is positive because that's what tested for that substance

323
00:20:16.501 --> 00:20:20.390
in the urine.
The blood test is irrelevant.
They weren't tested.
See?
But,
and then,

324
00:20:20.410 --> 00:20:24.680
then people that don't get that,
you see,
oh,
but he passed the blood test.
Right.

325
00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:28.410
You guys are full of Shit.
It's like,
no,
no,
no,
no.
The urine is the big one here.

326
00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:32.620
I saw that his own doctor was posting that on doctor hightower.

327
00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:36.660
I guess this is chiropractor doesn't count.
Yeah.

328
00:20:36.690 --> 00:20:39.630
Who's posting on Instagram?
Free.
John Jones.
And I was like,
cool.

329
00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:42.290
Well this is not like smart to Saddleback.

330
00:20:42.490 --> 00:20:46.580
You're talking about the wrong substance,
the wrong test rather.
No,

331
00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:47.980
they just don't get it.
I

332
00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:51.410
<v 1>think now my phone,
I don't know what's going to make us like,
God dammit.</v>

333
00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:55.240
Is it or is it the fucking do with weed?
The fire is burning down.
Yeah,
that's it.

334
00:20:55.241 --> 00:20:59.620
Yeah.
My car was covered in ash this morning.
Yeah,
it's out there,
bro.
It's scary.

335
00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:01.000
Yeah.
But with John,

336
00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:04.460
you got to listen to what Chil chill had a good narrative and I think I don't

337
00:21:04.461 --> 00:21:05.750
have many hour with Air Hawaii.

338
00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:10.660
He was just saying that's such an old school drug like to be associated with

339
00:21:10.661 --> 00:21:13.360
that and does pause for that.
And he was,
I got,
you know,

340
00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:18.060
he said the same thing cause I know a few things about pds for God's sakes.
Yeah.

341
00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:22.060
And so he was saying that old school drug,
they're missing the good shit.

342
00:21:22.090 --> 00:21:25.990
Like he got away with a lot of other stuff.
If you're,
if that's in your system,

343
00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:28.930
you just don't,
you know what I'm saying?
It's like if you want a car,

344
00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:31.570
you're not going to just get a fucking 64 Ferrari Daytona.

345
00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:35.350
You got to start with some other shit itself was civic.
Yeah,
exactly.

346
00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:40.150
Yeah.
With a one bad tire that I'm bringing to the game,

347
00:21:40.170 --> 00:21:44.610
there's levels to this for God's sakes.
What do you think happened?
Uh,

348
00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:49.590
you just got caught.
Yeah,
I,
well I and uh,

349
00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:54.400
I'm sure you could talk to you.
The uh,
Novitsky when I said Golden Snitch,

350
00:21:54.401 --> 00:21:55.720
that's a complimentary term.

351
00:21:55.721 --> 00:21:59.880
I don't dislike the guy think he's clean up the sport anyways.
It's clean up.

352
00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:04.330
Go and snatch and that's a good beer.
20 beers back there.
I would like a beer.

353
00:22:05.030 --> 00:22:09.160
I wouldn't mind a cold one too,
man.
It's the world's burning down dot.

354
00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:12.310
That's not the same if there is,
it's really old,

355
00:22:12.311 --> 00:22:16.900
but I'll all a studio.
We've got to make sure we have fucking beer on his,

356
00:22:16.910 --> 00:22:19.870
gets some kegs going.
That's what I'm talking about.
Get a couple.

357
00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:22.490
There was a funny picture that somebody put on Instagram,

358
00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:26.770
a meme of two giraffes going at it and they're like,
this is true.

359
00:22:28.090 --> 00:22:32.020
They are huge man and giant fucking huge.

360
00:22:32.170 --> 00:22:35.680
Is this the first time I was just a fight pass contender series?

361
00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:39.680
I hear this with very good people.
Dig It.
Powerful cats and gone home.

362
00:22:39.730 --> 00:22:43.540
Oh Pow or full cat thing.
Gun for sure.
Fight again.

363
00:22:45.010 --> 00:22:49.900
Um,
I think she was saying that she was having some like some headway shoes.
Yeah,

364
00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:53.080
she's talking about right now.
Just talking about what's going on right now.

365
00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:56.970
I don't know.
Jamie and the other one being this beer.
Goddamnit and Jamie.

366
00:22:58.240 --> 00:22:59.980
She probably talked to him about it.
What is she talking about?

367
00:22:59.981 --> 00:23:02.080
She wanted to fight.
Crank this up.
Jay Wu.
I'm not mad at that.

368
00:23:02.081 --> 00:23:05.170
Jamie type mood cranked this up so we get here.
What?

369
00:23:05.171 --> 00:23:08.740
She's talking cat Zingano photography.
Oh,
it's her photography.

370
00:23:08.770 --> 00:23:13.660
It's like a documentary.
Well,
I'll watch it.
Oh,
GSP crank this.

371
00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:19.660
He's big right now.
I saw him in uh,
in Vegas.
Thicker than a snickers.

372
00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:23.890
Yeah,
he does a pretty sick,
but he's got muscle thickness.
Right.
He doesn't want,

373
00:23:24.250 --> 00:23:25.180
he doesn't want to be light.

374
00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:29.020
If he's going to fight Michael motherfucking Biz Bang.

375
00:23:29.021 --> 00:23:30.610
I'm excited to see how the fight goes down.

376
00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:33.610
I don't think it's as big as it draws.
Everyone thinks though.
No,

377
00:23:33.611 --> 00:23:34.450
I think you're correct.

378
00:23:34.451 --> 00:23:37.390
I think a lot of people have passed or zipping up his lip.

379
00:23:37.391 --> 00:23:39.720
Like he's not saying anything.
Well,
maybe you should start talking to,

380
00:23:39.730 --> 00:23:42.430
cause that's how you make money.
Both.
You started talking chairs,
brother

381
00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:48.600
again goes back to Madison Square Garden.
Yeah.

382
00:23:48.890 --> 00:23:52.070
Actually if I did commentary,
but I said,
I'm only doing an English accent.

383
00:23:52.270 --> 00:23:57.010
We're from now I'm wearing a bow tie.
If you wear a bow tie,

384
00:23:57.130 --> 00:24:01.790
I feel like people do revolt.
Just fuck this dude.
Think it's adorable.

385
00:24:01.850 --> 00:24:06.560
No,
I,
I don't know man.
I feel like people make you look good in the boats.

386
00:24:06.561 --> 00:24:09.950
I thanks man.
Thanks Bro.
Thanks Bro.
I'm thinking that turn it pink.

387
00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:14.060
There's a pink bow tie.
Just all pink.
Uh,
that card stack though.

388
00:24:14.090 --> 00:24:18.980
It's a great card.
What's on the card?
Uh,
you got Tj Dillashaw,
Cody Garbrandt,

389
00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:23.060
which is the best way to link card.
That's a good fight.
Great fight you got,
uh,

390
00:24:23.150 --> 00:24:25.220
and that,
this might,
I don't know if this is confirmed or not.

391
00:24:25.250 --> 00:24:28.190
You might know Jamie are,
you might know him,
probably do a fucking promo for it.

392
00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:32.250
A Mazda doll versa.
Wonderboy.
Yes.
It is confirmed.
Yeah.

393
00:24:32.510 --> 00:24:35.300
That's some of the fucking fight.
Yeah.
I haven't done that Promo for that yet.

394
00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:41.180
Oh yeah.
There's some good fights on there.
Look at that.
Johnny Hendricks,

395
00:24:41.390 --> 00:24:46.030
Bora Cina Johnny Hendricks still fighting.
Sliding back,
man,
not,
yeah.

396
00:24:48.410 --> 00:24:52.920
Is that for us?
The hobbies?
Uh,
brother.
Oh,

397
00:24:52.921 --> 00:24:57.630
it is?
Yes.
Damn,
that's right.
Yeah.
Good for him.
He's supposed to be a bad ass.

398
00:24:58.470 --> 00:25:02.490
He better be if your brothers for us.
I mean you better know some shit.

399
00:25:02.550 --> 00:25:04.950
Yeah you should know some shit dropping the ball man.

400
00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:07.510
It looks like Thomson and Mazda at all.

401
00:25:08.090 --> 00:25:10.980
Cause I was the first fight in the main card.
Nice.

402
00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:14.760
Tj Dillashaw and Cody Garbrandt a big fight man.
This is,

403
00:25:14.790 --> 00:25:19.470
this is why this car is so good.
So busy being a Saint Pierre.
It's a good fight.

404
00:25:19.471 --> 00:25:22.050
It's not going to knock your hair back but it's a fun fight.

405
00:25:22.051 --> 00:25:25.230
We don't know who's going to win that garb.
Rent until shawl.
God Damn.

406
00:25:25.231 --> 00:25:26.250
That's a tough one to pick.

407
00:25:26.550 --> 00:25:30.540
And then soap car brand saw back is 100% I'm sure it is.
It sounds like it is.

408
00:25:30.570 --> 00:25:32.910
You know what I'm saying?
He's back training and just I hate,

409
00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.190
I hate to see someone with a back injury.

410
00:25:35.190 --> 00:25:39.700
Rush it back cause we kind of taking this time though.
Yeah he's a smart kid.

411
00:25:39.730 --> 00:25:42.660
He's around good people and he's been at the youth as much as he was.
He'd been,

412
00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:44.010
God,
it's been a minute.

413
00:25:44.011 --> 00:25:46.830
Remember this was filed a while ago and he even push it back even longer and

414
00:25:46.831 --> 00:25:49.950
people were like talking shit to him.
But I think it's very smart and calculated.

415
00:25:49.951 --> 00:25:54.560
Definitely smart dude.
He has potential to be a superstar.
Fuck Aa does.
Um,

416
00:25:54.630 --> 00:25:58.350
and that's what really interesting.
Fine,
great fight.
And Dominick Cruz,

417
00:25:58.351 --> 00:26:03.070
Cody Garbrandt was to s what does that December 30th okay,

418
00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:08.130
so 2016 so a that's an interesting man.
So that's quite a while ago.

419
00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:11.250
It get enough and he wouldn't rush it back.
Switch be in champion.

420
00:26:11.251 --> 00:26:12.270
Really don't have to rush back.

421
00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:17.220
So you got Tj so eight months after that fight and when did his back at her,

422
00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:19.260
did you get hurt and training?
Yeah,

423
00:26:19.261 --> 00:26:22.230
cause we are where they're supposed to fight in that on that Vegas card.
Right.

424
00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:25.620
The July card.
I just hope he's done everything.
I know a,

425
00:26:25.621 --> 00:26:28.590
he was doing some of that Regina king stuff to try to get a sense from the

426
00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:31.800
Germany,
didn't they?
Yeah.
Yeah.
He went over there and got that treatment.

427
00:26:32.430 --> 00:26:34.950
He's a smart kid and he's young too.
That's the other thing on his side.

428
00:26:34.951 --> 00:26:36.750
And he doesn't have a lot of miles on them.
Right.

429
00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:37.710
I bet he's going to be all right.

430
00:26:37.740 --> 00:26:40.990
And then Tj has the teachers doing a lot of his camp out here and he's,

431
00:26:41.070 --> 00:26:44.370
he's making things up.
It's got such a fight.
It's a good fight man.

432
00:26:44.550 --> 00:26:45.371
And that gives plant in.

433
00:26:45.371 --> 00:26:48.460
Teachers never slacked off from the time they were first supposed to be scared

434
00:26:48.610 --> 00:26:53.610
of easiest in super shape and he's like getting better constantly with the odds

435
00:26:54.121 --> 00:26:58.200
are on that flight.
To me clothes,
it's such a good fight.
I think the big factor,

436
00:26:58.201 --> 00:27:00.990
one of the big factors is Cody's hands,
his power,

437
00:27:01.290 --> 00:27:04.860
power and speed of lightning.
Lightning combination fast too.

438
00:27:04.861 --> 00:27:07.890
But then Cody's fast with crazy power.
Yeah.

439
00:27:07.950 --> 00:27:12.690
But I feel like Tj see Cody's take down a fence is really getting his is really

440
00:27:12.691 --> 00:27:16.500
getting as fast as fuck.
But then TJ mixes it up.
So wellness footwork,

441
00:27:16.530 --> 00:27:20.040
but then Cody's footwork against Dominick Cruz was ridiculous.
Fantastic.

442
00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:21.240
It's a really good fighter.

443
00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:25.140
I think Tj is going to be better than he was against Dominick Cruz too.
You know,

444
00:27:25.141 --> 00:27:26.490
I think the Dominick Cruz fight,

445
00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:29.520
he was super emotional and he got real flat footed.

446
00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:32.430
And there was times in the fight where he was like loading up,

447
00:27:32.431 --> 00:27:35.940
looking for a big shot.
Yep.
Trying to finish a mom can't do that to Dominic.

448
00:27:35.941 --> 00:27:38.100
He's just not going to be there.
See,
here's the thing,

449
00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:40.730
Cody Garbrandt verse Dominick Cruz,

450
00:27:41.390 --> 00:27:45.310
is Cody that damn good way just outclassed Dominick Cruz or did Dominick Cruz

451
00:27:45.311 --> 00:27:48.510
had an off night or do they just do the not match up?
Right.

452
00:27:48.511 --> 00:27:52.740
You know what I'm saying?
I think Dominic is,
you know,

453
00:27:52.741 --> 00:27:56.070
fantastic fighter,
but he's had some foot issues too.
You know,

454
00:27:56.071 --> 00:28:00.390
Dominic has got that plantar fasciitis.
Yup.
Yeah.
Well massive surgeries,
right?

455
00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:02.820
He's had both knees operated on more than once.

456
00:28:03.090 --> 00:28:07.520
He's had a torn groin muscle that fucked him up.
Like he's had something,

457
00:28:07.540 --> 00:28:12.360
some [inaudible] for a minute.
He also works for UFC nonstop.
Yup.

458
00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:17.370
And now that Brian Stan retired,
I assume that he's gonna work more nonstop.

459
00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:20.910
So what's Cody and Tj doing while you're working for the UFC?

460
00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:25.140
I don't think you can do both and be as successful as you want to be,

461
00:28:26.070 --> 00:28:30.240
not to be the dynamics.
So damn good.
And he's kind of,
you know,

462
00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:33.840
he's so good where he can pull it off and still,
you know,

463
00:28:33.841 --> 00:28:38.300
beat anyone in the world.
But to be like legend status.
See,

464
00:28:38.310 --> 00:28:41.820
I don't think John,
well that's a bad example.
I don't think calmer could do,

465
00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:45.630
could work for UFC and night work with you on UC paper using be Connor Mcgregor.

466
00:28:45.710 --> 00:28:48.180
That makes sense.
It does make sense.
You know,

467
00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:51.570
I think the big factor in that fight was a,

468
00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:55.800
the speed and the combinations.
A Cody,
there's landed more often.

469
00:28:55.801 --> 00:28:57.120
There were just better,
you know,

470
00:28:57.121 --> 00:29:00.600
like he was connecting on Dominic and Dominic was throwing things just a little

471
00:29:00.601 --> 00:29:05.070
wider.
And then Cody was just getting in with those shots like multiple times.

472
00:29:05.071 --> 00:29:07.010
Clipped him with harsh and Cody lands,

473
00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:12.020
you're like God Tam at 35 click a little Mike Tyson and he's obsessed with being

474
00:29:13.201 --> 00:29:16.800
the best,
you know?
Yeah,
very interesting fight.

475
00:29:17.250 --> 00:29:19.910
He also speaks well.
All he cares about is fighting his,

476
00:29:20.010 --> 00:29:22.700
he has the s him and Kevin,
we have the most potential,

477
00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:26.710
like your next breakout superstars,
nine grain.
The thing about,
uh,

478
00:29:26.730 --> 00:29:31.560
TJ though was Tj has more weapons.
Like TJ does more stuff like Cody.

479
00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:35.070
Um,
although he does kick and does throw knees and does throw elbows.

480
00:29:35.250 --> 00:29:38.020
He's so good at boxing that you see in my prime,

481
00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:40.860
predominantly up like a boxing oriented style.

482
00:29:40.861 --> 00:29:43.450
And too though he's a phenomenal wrestler in high school.

483
00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:47.710
Tj though is like he'll mix it up more with kicks.
Yeah.
Tj.
Yeah,
exactly.

484
00:29:47.711 --> 00:29:48.544
He's like,

485
00:29:48.550 --> 00:29:52.690
he's more of a Swiss army knife where fucking Cody garb and it's like a goddamn

486
00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:56.410
machete if that thing lands game over.
It's already has ridiculous footwork.

487
00:29:56.500 --> 00:29:59.350
Good way to put it.
But he's like a Swiss army knife.
You base a lot of tools.

488
00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:01.510
Yeah.
It's like,
you know,

489
00:30:01.511 --> 00:30:04.900
Dominic Cruz set the blueprint and then Tj Dillashaw download it.

490
00:30:04.901 --> 00:30:07.780
Proud to next level and current Cody Garbrandt and even download that,

491
00:30:07.781 --> 00:30:10.900
brought the next level.
He brought it to the next level of Dominic beat him.

492
00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:15.820
It's true.
Did he beat him though?
No,
I think as a draw.
Me Too.

493
00:30:15.850 --> 00:30:18.520
I think it was as close to a draws a human can get.
I just,

494
00:30:18.521 --> 00:30:20.140
I don't understand those fights.

495
00:30:20.141 --> 00:30:23.590
When who the fuck knows and you decided one guy's the champ and one guy's a

496
00:30:23.591 --> 00:30:26.260
loser.
You got to pick someone though.
I know.
It's crazy.

497
00:30:26.261 --> 00:30:30.190
It seems like in a fight like that,
that seems like a draw to me.
It really does.

498
00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:33.550
Let's open some overtime for God's sakes.
Go sits around it just,

499
00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.840
I mean if anybody was going to get it,
I get given the nod to cruise cause he,
he,

500
00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:43.020
he definitely seemed to get Cody to fight his fight more and he connected with

501
00:30:44.081 --> 00:30:48.820
some good shots.
But Jesus,
it was so close.
You mean Tj?
Yeah.
What did I say?
Cody?

502
00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:49.560
Cody.
Yeah.

503
00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:53.350
I could just so God damn close if anything can do a draw and then just make them

504
00:30:53.351 --> 00:30:55.510
fight the next fight.
So there's a clear winner.

505
00:30:55.690 --> 00:30:59.200
Dominic landed more like clean shots on Tj,

506
00:30:59.410 --> 00:31:02.470
but TJ landed a lot of shit on him too.

507
00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:06.800
And it hit him with a lot of leg kicks to had him limping teen.

508
00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:08.020
Although he got so,
like you said,

509
00:31:08.021 --> 00:31:10.500
he got so emotional and it's just head hunting for awhile there,

510
00:31:10.510 --> 00:31:13.690
which is where I thought Domic started to win rounds and have to go back and

511
00:31:13.691 --> 00:31:15.480
watch that again.
Me Too.
But flood them.

512
00:31:15.490 --> 00:31:17.920
Remember how watched it twice maybe three times for that.

513
00:31:17.950 --> 00:31:21.040
It was such a God damn close fight.
I remember being surprised at Tj.

514
00:31:21.041 --> 00:31:24.820
Didn't try to finish him with led cakes because Dominic was wobbling so bad.

515
00:31:25.110 --> 00:31:27.250
That guy with my surgery too.
You know what I'm saying?
At all.

516
00:31:27.251 --> 00:31:29.140
Fair in love and war.
Go ahead and kick those knees.

517
00:31:29.141 --> 00:31:31.600
Go Slam that plantar fasciitis.
Yeah,

518
00:31:31.810 --> 00:31:34.690
he was saying after the fight that that's what it was.
It was his feet.

519
00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:37.780
His feet are just fucked up cause that's what we call career.

520
00:31:37.990 --> 00:31:38.823
Well you know what it is.

521
00:31:39.190 --> 00:31:43.210
It's because he came back after a long time off because the surgeries and once

522
00:31:43.211 --> 00:31:45.730
you got in shape,
he had to make up some last time he went nuts.

523
00:31:45.790 --> 00:31:49.240
He went nuts and he tore the punch his feet on here that that she had.

524
00:31:49.241 --> 00:31:52.030
Apparently.
He's like,
so have you ever had it?
No Bro.

525
00:31:52.210 --> 00:31:56.110
I had it for my camp against Mitch reone cause I again,
I've run,
I love to run.

526
00:31:56.111 --> 00:31:57.460
I was doing so much roadwork.

527
00:31:57.940 --> 00:32:02.940
I see that in the mornings was the worst time I'd get up and it would take me 15

528
00:32:02.951 --> 00:32:05.950
minutes just to kind of make my way to the toilet.

529
00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:11.050
Like my foot hurt so goddamn bad.
That wouldn't be a good thing for me today.

530
00:32:11.380 --> 00:32:15.270
Today I don't have 15 minutes today I got,
I got the shits that you'll,

531
00:32:15.271 --> 00:32:18.550
you get like you got about 30 seconds notice.
Yeah,
it's go time.

532
00:32:18.551 --> 00:32:21.620
I feel like the rumble talking about the word,
the fucking horrible.

533
00:32:21.970 --> 00:32:26.430
Like oh Jesus.
Okay.
Can I get a level five?
We go,
yeah.

534
00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:29.590
If you have to wait 50 oh leg lock.
Cause she's a little high.
A little high.

535
00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:33.590
She can't do that.
I mean you got to get a scoot down.
I'm so condescending.

536
00:32:33.591 --> 00:32:37.600
Your car honey.
I'll see what's wrong with that though.
It's rude.
Is it honey?

537
00:32:37.690 --> 00:32:40.090
If I was her really upset at me and

538
00:32:40.090 --> 00:32:43.790
<v 0>not me,
I'd find it flattering that triangle up,
baby.
Going to lock it up.</v>

539
00:32:43.791 --> 00:32:47.450
Go on sweetie.
Lock it up like of just being a dick.
Come on sweetie.

540
00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:51.290
You think triangle,
sweetie bear.
Glad.
Hook the leg.
Hook the leg.
Hook the leg.

541
00:32:51.740 --> 00:32:55.040
Hook the leg.
What?
We're doing work now.
You've got the arm bar.
Yeah,

542
00:32:55.041 --> 00:32:58.100
she's got good crank cranking.
That girl,
Dude.
She's got both here.
Oh,

543
00:32:58.101 --> 00:33:01.010
she's got that arm?
Yes.
What I'm saying?
That foot's in play.

544
00:33:01.011 --> 00:33:05.700
Then we'll see those photos.
Feeder in play.
It's supposed to hook that leg.

545
00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:07.640
He's supposed to control,
uh,
the position

546
00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:08.533
<v 3>better.</v>

547
00:33:10.830 --> 00:33:11.870
<v 0>Who can that legs giant.</v>

548
00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:12.860
<v 3>Um,
you know,</v>

549
00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:19.830
<v 0>major people do it two ways.
When you are control someone from a triangle,</v>

550
00:33:20.010 --> 00:33:22.050
do you hook the leg like this?

551
00:33:22.290 --> 00:33:26.730
Do you scoop it around on the outside or do you go underneath it depends,

552
00:33:26.731 --> 00:33:30.110
right where,
where you're at.
Exactly.
I go underneath.
Underneath.

553
00:33:30.130 --> 00:33:32.850
Seems like the move.
Right,
because you can elevate their leg.
Yeah.
Yeah.

554
00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:36.960
Some people don't like that though.
Some people like to just hold onto the leg,

555
00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:41.460
the leg to a rat.
I mean,
you know what man,
whatever the fuck you can.
Yeah,

556
00:33:41.461 --> 00:33:42.030
exactly.

557
00:33:42.030 --> 00:33:44.730
Especially when punches or flying or you're going to cue the battle for whatever

558
00:33:44.731 --> 00:33:47.310
it takes to get that goddamn leg.
It's funny,

559
00:33:47.311 --> 00:33:51.570
like so many people have so many opinions on a unlike hand positions and chokes

560
00:33:51.571 --> 00:33:55.430
and stuff.
It's all fun and games to him.
The bullets are flying,
you know,

561
00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:57.160
I want to learn from that,

562
00:33:57.200 --> 00:34:00.960
that DV ever learned that Gogo choke that I'm talking about the broth.

563
00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:05.430
World choke.
Yeah.
Do you know that choke?
Not like Rothwell does.
Yeah.
His,

564
00:34:05.431 --> 00:34:07.740
his instructor.
Um,
Jamie,

565
00:34:07.741 --> 00:34:10.470
see you get five Ben Rothwell's Jujitsu instructor.

566
00:34:10.471 --> 00:34:13.320
Once he finds he's want to Hickson's guys,
he's a bark problem.

567
00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:16.470
The Hixson apparently this choke that this guy's got.
It's just phenomenal.

568
00:34:17.250 --> 00:34:22.110
What's up with Rothwell?
Did he piss hot or something?
He pissed hot.
I think.

569
00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:26.760
I'm pretty sure.
I feel like you did.
Yeah.
Did any news on jds?

570
00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:32.100
No.
He pissed hot for a diuretic.
This is like,

571
00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:35.150
I mean,
what do we got to do?
You tell your boy that golden snitch.

572
00:34:35.160 --> 00:34:39.660
Just relax a little bit.
Nope,
can't do it.
Louise.

573
00:34:39.661 --> 00:34:43.620
Claudio,
there he goes.
Louise.
Claudio apparently is a master.
That shit.

574
00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:46.110
That shit man showed the big maze Chokan bitches out.

575
00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:50.430
He showed a lot of people that choke and they were like,
what the fuck?
Justi Huh?

576
00:34:50.490 --> 00:34:52.980
Yeah.
I guess it's just somehow or another,
the way he's holding it,

577
00:34:52.981 --> 00:34:56.660
he's going into your neck,
into your throat as a,

578
00:34:56.670 --> 00:34:58.680
as he's choking you with it and it's just,
you know,

579
00:34:58.681 --> 00:35:03.681
it's like the people just develop the finest like application of one technique.

580
00:35:04.291 --> 00:35:08.370
Like they just get it down,
whether it's ads or shipping gas,
their shit.

581
00:35:08.390 --> 00:35:11.280
Did it Rothwell tap out Barnett with that?
Yes,
he did tell.

582
00:35:11.310 --> 00:35:15.460
You know that Shit's legit.
Barnett's as legit as it gets grappa wise.
Yeah.

583
00:35:15.470 --> 00:35:19.110
You surprise him with that shit insane.
And you see when he got,
I'm like,

584
00:35:19.410 --> 00:35:24.270
Josh was like,
yeah,
I'm just like,
God damn.
What are you doing?
Yeah,

585
00:35:24.290 --> 00:35:26.190
it was nasty.
Like he wasn't getting out of that.

586
00:35:26.730 --> 00:35:29.250
And a lot of ways those kind of like old school chokes,

587
00:35:29.490 --> 00:35:34.230
like that's allows shitted Josh Barnett's into,
right.
It's catch wrestling stuff.

588
00:35:34.350 --> 00:35:38.100
Break your neck off.
I like Josh.
Yeah.
How about,
I had

589
00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:40.140
<v 1>a Goldberg Burgum on the fire and the kid,</v>

590
00:35:40.170 --> 00:35:42.960
you know Goldberg the wrestler and he was,
he's real.

591
00:35:42.961 --> 00:35:45.120
He's like best friends with Brock and I said,

592
00:35:45.121 --> 00:35:47.040
do you think Brock is going to come back?
And he goes,

593
00:35:47.220 --> 00:35:51.840
he was going to till John Piss hot.
Oh my.
I said,

594
00:35:52.050 --> 00:35:56.570
you're breaking my heart over.
Oh my God.
Oh my God,
no.

595
00:35:57.700 --> 00:36:00.180
Oh my God.
Right then that,
that fuck up your Saturday.

596
00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:03.150
He thought the fire's coming in and fuck your sat up.
That affect your Saturday.

597
00:36:03.151 --> 00:36:07.380
I can't do this Ryan pm on Saturday.
I literally just went

598
00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:12.450
and I looked at Goulburn.
I said,
get out.
Come on,
get the fuck out.

599
00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:16.470
What in the fuck is wrong?
Crazies that he was going to,

600
00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:19.830
we're going to see that monster again.
What is wrong with the world?

601
00:36:21.630 --> 00:36:26.430
Jesus Christ,
whoever that Meade had is that gave that shit to John.

602
00:36:26.430 --> 00:36:28.530
John's gotta be on Suicide Watch right now.

603
00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:33.510
Sitting there with a fucking one of those shakes.
You know,
they always go,

604
00:36:33.640 --> 00:36:37.620
I fucking worn bro.
I warned my swear we should get a team together,

605
00:36:37.621 --> 00:36:41.550
like navy seal team six and just go fuck him up.
Basically it tainted batch.

606
00:36:41.850 --> 00:36:45.660
You know like I gave him,
I gave him the right stuff.
I took the same shit.

607
00:36:45.661 --> 00:36:48.900
I passed.
Yeah there.
Fuck.
I almost said Dirk Nowitzki.

608
00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:50.690
Maybe they didn't know about the,

609
00:36:50.790 --> 00:36:54.240
maybe they're testing over and over again with the blood test.
See,
I heard it.

610
00:36:54.280 --> 00:36:58.440
The new test out of the urine test is Nash to golden snitch about it,
bro.

611
00:36:58.441 --> 00:37:00.450
He got a direct line to him who I will,

612
00:37:00.451 --> 00:37:03.180
he's going to come on the podcast again after John.

613
00:37:03.181 --> 00:37:07.200
We'd get the thing about John.
Well,
I mean if it times out that way,
if not,

614
00:37:07.201 --> 00:37:09.290
we'll do it before,
but I'm going to have monsoon.
Yeah.

615
00:37:09.291 --> 00:37:13.240
It kind of delayed though to that comes out so we get the real fucking info.

616
00:37:14.270 --> 00:37:15.510
Yeah,
probably a good idea.

617
00:37:15.511 --> 00:37:20.070
It's so depressing to me because it felt like John returning the way he did.

618
00:37:20.071 --> 00:37:22.140
Like that's like a superstar victory.

619
00:37:22.170 --> 00:37:25.740
He handled himself with class and dignity after it was over.

620
00:37:26.010 --> 00:37:30.750
I mean everything about it was amazing.
And then to go from that to Piss and hot,

621
00:37:30.810 --> 00:37:34.850
you're like,
oh no,
I was at universal when I found out.
Chamie texted it to me.

622
00:37:34.860 --> 00:37:36.930
He texted me and I thought you were fucking with me.
I thought it was,

623
00:37:36.990 --> 00:37:38.490
I thought you're trolling is fucking with me.

624
00:37:38.491 --> 00:37:40.290
I just cut off the Harry Potter ride man.

625
00:37:40.291 --> 00:37:45.000
I was feeling good about fuck your day up.
How's the is pretty good.

626
00:37:45.290 --> 00:37:48.930
I say Harry Potter ride was fun.
I thought it,
I thought it was fake news.

627
00:37:49.020 --> 00:37:52.470
Fuck man.
Super fakeness.
Super depressing.

628
00:37:52.820 --> 00:37:54.960
You know what I was thinking about?
Um,

629
00:37:55.650 --> 00:37:59.510
what the so withdrawn being out and then you got common,
right?
Like Connor,
Nate.

630
00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:02.640
Things like looming in the air.
That's like what they got to do next.

631
00:38:02.641 --> 00:38:03.870
These huge money fights on that.

632
00:38:03.871 --> 00:38:08.871
There's not a huge money fight but Connor has changed the game for the better.

633
00:38:08.881 --> 00:38:10.980
Especially if you're the fighter but it's like,

634
00:38:11.340 --> 00:38:15.210
you know with WME he's steering the ship.
Yes.
Like think,

635
00:38:15.211 --> 00:38:18.030
think about it cause he made over cause the numbers coming out.

636
00:38:18.031 --> 00:38:19.680
They're saying it's going to be his paper of all time.

637
00:38:19.740 --> 00:38:22.230
So he made a hundred something million dollars,
right?
Yeah.

638
00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:25.860
So you're telling me if you're kind and you're part of his team,
he didn't go,

639
00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:30.510
Hey,
fight Nate Diaz for how much?
Five.
10 million.
Oh,

640
00:38:30.511 --> 00:38:34.020
and also we need your weird this Reebok and they're gonna pay you $100,000 a

641
00:38:34.021 --> 00:38:38.230
year college.
You're fucking crazy.
Well I,

642
00:38:38.290 --> 00:38:42.610
I'm sure there's non negotiables and one non negotiables.
The Reebok deal,

643
00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:45.280
like you can't get around it,
but what you can do disagree.

644
00:38:45.430 --> 00:38:47.380
Well it seems like he can't get around it right now.

645
00:38:47.381 --> 00:38:50.650
Everybody's wearing Reebok clothes.
Well,
no,
you're,
you can get this.

646
00:38:50.740 --> 00:38:54.850
I'm not saying he's not,
not going to wear Reebok,
but what you have to do it,

647
00:38:54.860 --> 00:38:56.740
you're,
you're playing a different game now.

648
00:38:57.040 --> 00:39:00.940
You're talking about the biggest athlete combat sports and you're not getting

649
00:39:00.941 --> 00:39:05.620
him for the 200,000 you're paying a year.
Oh yeah.
That he can go,
listen,

650
00:39:05.770 --> 00:39:09.590
I'm down to wear Reebok.
It's a different animal now.
Well,

651
00:39:09.610 --> 00:39:12.880
Reebok professionally sponsors him to site.
They do.

652
00:39:12.881 --> 00:39:17.470
Paige vanzant just like they did kinda different and more money.
Yeah.
More,

653
00:39:17.471 --> 00:39:21.040
but not to like think how much he made to just wear those,
you know,

654
00:39:21.041 --> 00:39:25.870
whatever he had on his trunks.
Right.
That's a good point.
You know that fight,

655
00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:29.830
if it really did get six and a half million paper view bys,

656
00:39:30.190 --> 00:39:32.800
like they were talking about Conor making $100 million,

657
00:39:32.801 --> 00:39:37.330
if it got 5 million paper revise,
it got one and a half more than that.

658
00:39:37.930 --> 00:39:39.100
It's like he's super,
that's,

659
00:39:39.130 --> 00:39:41.350
that's up for debate because you know how that came about.

660
00:39:41.650 --> 00:39:46.330
So I think Dana was sitting on,
on that snoop cast or something and uh,

661
00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:50.670
your eyes filming,
right.
And Dana goes,
he didn't think he was being recorded.

662
00:39:50.671 --> 00:39:55.540
And Dana goes 6.5 mil and everyone's like,
damn,
you know,
in the room,

663
00:39:55.541 --> 00:39:57.730
like,
oh damn dog and Snoop's like damn dog.

664
00:39:57.760 --> 00:40:02.760
And then your eye turns on and goes 6.5 million and it shuts the camera off.

665
00:40:04.390 --> 00:40:07.270
But Dana never officially said 6.5 but that's how it got started.

666
00:40:07.550 --> 00:40:10.240
So in Espinosa from showtimes,
like,
uh,

667
00:40:10.241 --> 00:40:12.340
it's going to break the biggest preview numbers all the time,

668
00:40:12.341 --> 00:40:16.960
but we're thinking more around for something.
Oh,
like almost five.

669
00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:21.140
Yeah.
So who's,
who knows the truth and who doesn't?
I Dunno.

670
00:40:21.250 --> 00:40:24.550
I liked to go with Dana on this one.
I would say.
Yeah,

671
00:40:24.551 --> 00:40:26.820
I was crunk I blast it out to you right now online.

672
00:40:26.830 --> 00:40:31.510
It says trending towards 4.6 million.
Oh,
domestic.
Domestic.

673
00:40:31.570 --> 00:40:35.740
Oh well then it's 6.5 c this is my thing with Dana.

674
00:40:36.070 --> 00:40:39.580
He wouldn't just throw that up cause he doesn't wanna look like an idiot.

675
00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:43.840
Well especially with he did official or not.
If he says that to your ion snoop,

676
00:40:44.140 --> 00:40:48.040
he didn't think he was being recorded,
but Dana wasn't just like 6.5 everybody.

677
00:40:48.041 --> 00:40:49.060
Like he's not making that up.

678
00:40:49.090 --> 00:40:53.590
If it's trending towards 4.6 nationwide and America,

679
00:40:53.620 --> 00:40:58.540
that's 100% 2 million more overseas guarantee you that our calls,
it says that,

680
00:40:58.570 --> 00:41:01.950
uh,
it wasn't $100 worldwide either.
No,
it's 25 bucks.

681
00:41:01.951 --> 00:41:06.940
In some countries it's 24 99 or in the UK and Ireland,
you know,

682
00:41:07.060 --> 00:41:10.030
that's interesting.
But still you,
you still the pay everybody's,

683
00:41:10.050 --> 00:41:14.590
it's going to be around 6.5 from what I heard.
It's going to be 6.57 does.

684
00:41:14.591 --> 00:41:19.150
Does the UK have like a history of paper views like we do.

685
00:41:19.570 --> 00:41:24.490
Yeah.
Joshua quite the same.
That was,
that was a pay per view for them over there.

686
00:41:25.150 --> 00:41:28.930
But over here was it's free.
Free.
It was HBO.
Right.
Cause he's not a big as star.

687
00:41:29.020 --> 00:41:33.350
Right.
You know,
we like trade a little bit.
Yeah.
Yeah,
it makes sense.
Yeah.

688
00:41:33.351 --> 00:41:34.184
It doesn't make sense.

689
00:41:34.340 --> 00:41:37.100
<v 0>I just wonder how many people ordered pay per view.
I mean,
you know,
the whole,</v>

690
00:41:37.250 --> 00:41:40.370
the way they watch TVs different there and I don't think they consume as much TV

691
00:41:40.371 --> 00:41:44.180
as we do with flighting.
If Connor Slaton or anything Josh was finding they do.

692
00:41:44.570 --> 00:41:49.070
Yeah.
But I mean like overall England,
I mean,
correct me if I'm wrong,

693
00:41:49.071 --> 00:41:51.440
but I don't think they have as many channels as we do.

694
00:41:51.441 --> 00:41:56.441
I don't think they watch as much TV as we did this 2017 so that's not what I'm

695
00:41:56.631 --> 00:41:59.480
saying.
I just don't think that it's a normal part of their day,

696
00:41:59.481 --> 00:42:00.860
the way it is our day.

697
00:42:00.920 --> 00:42:05.200
I don't think people in England wa like well go BBC to find out.

698
00:42:05.330 --> 00:42:08.330
Yeah there is.
But I don't think they watch as much.
Yeah.

699
00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:11.210
I don't think they watch as much TV on a whole as we do.

700
00:42:11.240 --> 00:42:12.800
They have some great shows.
No,
no doubt.

701
00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:15.290
But I don't think they watch as much TV on a whole.

702
00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:16.460
I think that's more of a like a,

703
00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:20.810
it's probably fair to say a problem with our lazy ass.
Yeah.
It's a big problem.

704
00:42:20.870 --> 00:42:23.810
I watch some TV,
they're last.
I'll workout for guts to their own president.

705
00:42:23.811 --> 00:42:27.800
Works well,
works out at all.
Zero watches,

706
00:42:27.801 --> 00:42:30.700
five hours of TV a day.
He's hilarious.
He doesn't believe in bed.

707
00:42:30.740 --> 00:42:33.830
He thinks your body's a battery.
You think Juliet.
So He's,
do you choose?

708
00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:38.030
You only have so many beats.
That's why he looks like he's hilarious.
He's so fat.

709
00:42:38.580 --> 00:42:39.950
I was definitely an unhealthy looking.

710
00:42:40.040 --> 00:42:44.930
This fight to amazing by the way he paying attention at all.
Zero.
Um,

711
00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:48.980
yeah.
But either way I think it's going to break the paper,
your numbers.
So,

712
00:42:48.981 --> 00:42:51.500
but congress changes the dynamics for everyone.

713
00:42:51.520 --> 00:42:53.810
Cause now when you want him to fight again,

714
00:42:53.900 --> 00:42:57.590
you can't have them agree to those old terms.
He's a smart guy.

715
00:42:57.591 --> 00:43:01.250
And if he learned anything from Floyd,
you know when you,
when you fight Floyd,

716
00:43:01.251 --> 00:43:03.830
you're fighting a different animal.
Look at Bruce Buffer.
Could he look more,

717
00:43:03.890 --> 00:43:05.860
more board?
He looks exhausted.

718
00:43:05.870 --> 00:43:09.410
He might've seen too many shows you might've traveled to in the airline.
Miles.

719
00:43:09.790 --> 00:43:14.150
Dude,
look super tired.
He will.
It's Rotterdam.
It's been a long trip.

720
00:43:15.020 --> 00:43:18.110
Probably,
but he's ever the fights man.
Yeah.
You know,

721
00:43:18.111 --> 00:43:22.580
he gets it just does this 22nd things and he's recharging.
It's a mindset thing,

722
00:43:22.581 --> 00:43:25.790
son.
It is.
You gotta be in there.
You gotta be in there watching.

723
00:43:25.820 --> 00:43:28.940
There's rumors that he was going to work the Mayweather McGregor fight,

724
00:43:28.941 --> 00:43:32.960
but then I guess it didn't come to fruition.
Who did it?
Jimmy Lennon Junior,

725
00:43:32.961 --> 00:43:34.370
right?
Yeah,
he's good.
Yeah,
he's good.

726
00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:37.400
You know what my one complaint about that whole thing is I thought they could

727
00:43:37.401 --> 00:43:40.670
have made the intros way better.
Well,
turn the lights down.

728
00:43:40.671 --> 00:43:45.250
Let me hear the volume of the music.
I met Demi Lavato last night,
which made her,

729
00:43:45.251 --> 00:43:49.140
this lady,
she was at the comedy store.
God dammit,
the one nine.
I'm not there.

730
00:43:49.670 --> 00:43:54.000
She's very nice.
Is She nice?
Very nice.
Um,
but my point is,
uh,

731
00:43:54.110 --> 00:43:57.860
she sang the national anthem.
You never get the national anthem at an MMA fight.

732
00:43:57.890 --> 00:44:00.200
Why do they always do the national anthem at a boxing fight?

733
00:44:00.410 --> 00:44:03.350
Because box is awesome and they appreciate America.

734
00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:08.540
I think UFC has just too many goddamn countries fighting every night.
They can't.

735
00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:13.550
We definitely triangle.
Oh,
you were on the feet,
baby.
Now she's two A's to loose.

736
00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:16.730
She might be able to pull this off to and it doesn't look good here.
Not to wait.

737
00:44:17.570 --> 00:44:21.110
Pop that head out.
You got to grab that foot from the outside.
Just reach around.

738
00:44:21.170 --> 00:44:26.110
Oh no,
she's lost
sakes.
That bones all over.
It's all over.

739
00:44:26.111 --> 00:44:30.350
I says all to go ahead and pass.
Grow.
Yeah,
it's gone.
She can still lock this up.

740
00:44:30.550 --> 00:44:33.480
She's got get used to it.
There you go.
She went right back to it.
Yeah,

741
00:44:33.481 --> 00:44:37.310
but she just grabbed it with her.
The other girl.
The girl on the other side.
You?

742
00:44:37.360 --> 00:44:37.820
Yeah.

743
00:44:37.820 --> 00:44:42.820
Well she's just missing that one crucial step of passing the ankle and getting

744
00:44:43.531 --> 00:44:46.380
down,
locking down on the Shin Bone.
You got a force that step,

745
00:44:46.590 --> 00:44:50.140
but that's like your life depending on it.
Like if you are drowning like the,

746
00:44:50.330 --> 00:44:55.260
to be able to get your foot like this is so big that to not be able to get here.

747
00:44:55.261 --> 00:44:59.790
This should be your whole life's goal is to get ahead of that foot and get on

748
00:44:59.791 --> 00:45:00.624
that Shin.

749
00:45:00.900 --> 00:45:04.270
The girl on top lives to be in a triangle like she just dive in her head in
that.

750
00:45:04.320 --> 00:45:08.610
I feel like so much of what you're seeing when you're seeing an MMA is fatigue

751
00:45:08.850 --> 00:45:12.330
so much like that girl not locking up that triangle right there.

752
00:45:12.331 --> 00:45:17.100
If she was super duper fresh,
like in training,
no adrenaline,
no wait,

753
00:45:17.101 --> 00:45:19.920
cut.
She'd be able to lock that.
I tried going off to know her background.

754
00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:23.700
I would too.
I'm talking shit.
I hear Ya.
Sometimes fatigue,

755
00:45:23.820 --> 00:45:27.630
but I think that most of what they see or try and put the hook tell high she is.

756
00:45:27.690 --> 00:45:31.180
That's awesome.
Punching that groans.
Bloodshed alone on Bluebell.
Yeah,

757
00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:33.900
a little Blue Bell Desk.
But you're,

758
00:45:33.930 --> 00:45:38.340
you're seeing a lot of people just doing what they can do with their body at the

759
00:45:38.341 --> 00:45:41.050
moment.
For sure.
This is what they know.
We'll look at Shankar,

760
00:45:41.110 --> 00:45:43.530
when Brock Lesnar Shane was exhausted.

761
00:45:43.710 --> 00:45:47.760
I've never seen Shane in my life get tapped out from the head arm triangle ever.

762
00:45:47.820 --> 00:45:50.910
Oh,
he was.
He was done.
He was done.
And those rocks,
you know,
path.

763
00:45:50.911 --> 00:45:55.140
She's given up the deep half.
Oh,
okay.
Steph over.
Oh,

764
00:45:55.141 --> 00:45:58.260
that was so silly.
Shit work though.
Oh my God.

765
00:45:58.261 --> 00:46:00.420
She got to go ahead and crank on the chin.
I think you got a girl.

766
00:46:00.421 --> 00:46:03.210
She's exhausted.
She's going to tap.
She didn't tap gun.
Craig Smith.

767
00:46:03.480 --> 00:46:06.600
Triangle body tracking on sweet body turn.
Come on sweetie.
Body triangle.

768
00:46:07.470 --> 00:46:11.750
Get that squeeze on.
Oh,
she's got that.
She got it.
She's tapping.
Tapping yet.

769
00:46:11.810 --> 00:46:14.700
Watch this.
Go and break that neck like a chicken bone.

770
00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:16.730
I think she's gonna let her do it.
Nope,

771
00:46:16.740 --> 00:46:20.200
it's going pop now she's going to turn it into a hopper in the face turning
maps.

772
00:46:20.420 --> 00:46:25.010
Oh,
keep going.
Don't stop.
Right here.
Don't stop.
Right.
You keep going.

773
00:46:25.011 --> 00:46:28.650
You got stop right here.
Keep going.
Oh,
Z.
This is fatigue,
man.

774
00:46:28.860 --> 00:46:31.590
So like in that scramble,
there was no urgency on the bottom.

775
00:46:31.591 --> 00:46:34.590
She was trying to rest.
You cannot do that.
You have to,
when you,

776
00:46:34.591 --> 00:46:38.170
when you get that opportunity,
you got to scramble hard.
Well that's champions.

777
00:46:38.171 --> 00:46:41.790
Don't you know,
they don't rest in the transitions in the scrambles,

778
00:46:41.820 --> 00:46:44.310
they've moving move like you'll get at DC.
John Jones,

779
00:46:44.311 --> 00:46:47.610
there's no fucking or Tj Cody.
There's no rest there.

780
00:46:47.790 --> 00:46:49.730
I talked to chuck about that once could,

781
00:46:49.731 --> 00:46:51.690
Dale was talking about how when you go down to the ground,
he goes,

782
00:46:51.691 --> 00:46:53.100
once you're back touches the ground,

783
00:46:53.101 --> 00:46:57.060
you got to fucking explode like your life depends on,
it was so many guys,

784
00:46:57.061 --> 00:46:59.130
they get down to the ground and they tried to take a break.

785
00:46:59.131 --> 00:47:02.100
They rest and he goes,
you're already done.
If you do that.
He goes,

786
00:47:02.101 --> 00:47:04.560
you can't do that.
And he goes,
once you're back touches the ground,

787
00:47:04.561 --> 00:47:07.650
you've got to fucking explodes.
Nobody ever got a hold of chuck and like,

788
00:47:07.660 --> 00:47:10.710
can I look down this day and age though?
Guys don't really,
you know,

789
00:47:10.940 --> 00:47:13.910
especially on a high level like the top guys,
they don't rest there.

790
00:47:14.060 --> 00:47:17.290
Randy was the only one that ever controlled chuck on the grounds.
Right.

791
00:47:17.310 --> 00:47:19.150
Can I will work for cuts and grab them.
Get to her,

792
00:47:19.940 --> 00:47:22.020
cause she's beating the shit out of.
This is rough.

793
00:47:22.050 --> 00:47:26.100
You might want to stop this fight.
I had stopped this fight.

794
00:47:26.690 --> 00:47:29.500
This girl is taking a tremendous amount.
Stop the fire.

795
00:47:30.710 --> 00:47:35.380
<v 1>10 seconds.
You stop the fucking fight.
She's not protecting herself.
Jesus.</v>

796
00:47:35.381 --> 00:47:39.460
That girl took a lot of shots,
get her ass whooped.
Jesus.

797
00:47:39.461 --> 00:47:41.980
She took her a lot of shots.
You're on the right.
It's not too excited.

798
00:47:42.790 --> 00:47:45.650
She wasn't protecting herself.
Man.
That's one thing that's interesting,

799
00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:47.320
the difference between boxing and MMA.

800
00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:52.060
You got way more of a chance to get stopped in boxing.
If you're wobbly,

801
00:47:52.600 --> 00:47:56.530
they'll stop the whole fight.
Whereas an MMA,
they'll let shit go on way longer.

802
00:47:56.620 --> 00:48:00.610
Finish him.
Yeah.
They want to see some ga longer like the Conor fight.

803
00:48:00.850 --> 00:48:05.200
I agree with a stop at two but before his experience level against the best of

804
00:48:05.201 --> 00:48:09.880
all time.
But in general,
they're going to let you,
Anthony,
Joshua Klitschko.
Yeah,

805
00:48:09.881 --> 00:48:14.500
Jesus Christ.
Fuck.
I mean Joshua basically was flat out cold woke.

806
00:48:14.510 --> 00:48:18.370
Fuck us.
Didn't know where he was at.
And this is after he knocked Klitschko down.

807
00:48:18.371 --> 00:48:22.120
I had him on queers street.
Greatest fight ever.

808
00:48:22.121 --> 00:48:26.110
It was pretty much one of them.
Oh my God,
I'm so crunk.
Yeah,

809
00:48:26.111 --> 00:48:29.380
it was pretty God damn fantastic for the British paper view.

810
00:48:29.860 --> 00:48:33.210
According to the promoter.
Wow.
900,000 buys

811
00:48:33.380 --> 00:48:36.350
<v 4>the record somewhere.
It's somewhere at none of though.
That was the previous one.</v>

812
00:48:36.351 --> 00:48:37.080
That was David.
Hey,

813
00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:42.080
where's the 1.3 million for the live airing of Tyson fury?

814
00:48:45.350 --> 00:48:48.890
This does this quote here.
It says they broke it,
which was the Pacquiao.

815
00:48:48.920 --> 00:48:50.180
Mayweather fight.
But there's no,

816
00:48:50.210 --> 00:48:53.860
I'm looking also for numbers that show official and then it never came out.
Okay,

817
00:48:53.960 --> 00:48:54.630
fine.
Right.

818
00:48:54.630 --> 00:48:59.450
So it's somewhere around 1.5 million for Manny Pacquiao and Floyd Mayweather and

819
00:48:59.451 --> 00:49:03.290
that's just,
it's just an interesting part too though.

820
00:49:03.291 --> 00:49:06.290
I remember seeing some numbers like this for the Mayweather.
Mcgregor fight,

821
00:49:06.291 --> 00:49:08.480
this German TV,
they're like it for free.

822
00:49:08.481 --> 00:49:11.060
I think they're hanging out with 10 million people watching it there or

823
00:49:11.061 --> 00:49:11.894
something like,

824
00:49:11.990 --> 00:49:15.690
<v 1>well,
it's the same like in Brazil when like cyborg fights or since Silva,
it,</v>

825
00:49:15.790 --> 00:49:19.480
there's no paper view there.
So it's like 90 million people watch it.

826
00:49:20.410 --> 00:49:23.080
Dang.
16 million.
16 million.

827
00:49:23.110 --> 00:49:26.140
They got 16 million to watch David Haye versus hoody fight.

828
00:49:28.630 --> 00:49:33.220
Who's to say Tyson fury?
Well,
Tyson fury is a very famous guy,
right?

829
00:49:33.910 --> 00:49:37.390
Mary's 20 wasn't that big.
Now he's more famous.

830
00:49:37.600 --> 00:49:42.030
Did you see when he gave like a shout out to fricking,
uh,
uh,

831
00:49:42.040 --> 00:49:44.530
what's her name?
The girl,
the other Irish chick.

832
00:49:45.160 --> 00:49:48.220
Sinead O'connor because she's suicidal.
Have you seen that Sinead O'Connor,

833
00:49:48.340 --> 00:49:52.210
like Facebook live,
suicidal from a hotel?

834
00:49:52.270 --> 00:49:56.080
What's she have mental illness?
It's something I would say so yeah.
But then,
uh,

835
00:49:56.260 --> 00:49:59.920
Tyson fury reached out to her because he suffers from it too and was like,
Hey,

836
00:49:59.921 --> 00:50:02.860
call me.
I don't think she's calling him,
but he was like calling me,

837
00:50:03.190 --> 00:50:07.680
you need someone to talk to is going to livestream and banging her pod watches

838
00:50:08.930 --> 00:50:11.350
Tyson periods giant gets 400 pounds.

839
00:50:11.351 --> 00:50:15.670
We got to talk about is everybody keeps saying that you didn't tell the truth

840
00:50:15.880 --> 00:50:20.880
about your interaction with Nate Diaz because they're reading this transcript

841
00:50:21.160 --> 00:50:25.240
that somebody put up on the conversation you had with Nate Diaz where you said,

842
00:50:25.300 --> 00:50:28.040
I think you're off on this.
That's

843
00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:30.320
<v 0>exactly what I said,
cause he goes,
you're wrong,
you're wrong.</v>

844
00:50:30.321 --> 00:50:31.640
You don't know boxing.
And then I went,

845
00:50:31.641 --> 00:50:34.580
he went rounds and we're going back and forth and the I go,

846
00:50:34.581 --> 00:50:37.560
I think you're off on that.
I think you're off on this or off on that.

847
00:50:37.561 --> 00:50:39.530
And then someone wrote in quotes,

848
00:50:39.650 --> 00:50:44.180
he teed off on you that those words I a in my vocabulary to describe a fight

849
00:50:44.181 --> 00:50:48.920
teed off also.
I would never disrespect Nate like that in his face like that.

850
00:50:48.921 --> 00:50:51.640
That sounds heavy.
Have you ever heard of me doing anything like that?

851
00:50:51.641 --> 00:50:55.940
Like I would never do that and switch to also what kind of bitch move would that

852
00:50:55.941 --> 00:51:00.800
be you too?
I have nothing to do with that.
You find another grown man.

853
00:51:01.010 --> 00:51:05.030
I would never brag.
He teed off on you.
Nothing do with me.

854
00:51:05.031 --> 00:51:08.290
That's disgusting.
That's so gross.
No,
no.
I've never disrespected,
hey,
like,

855
00:51:08.300 --> 00:51:10.640
but so everybody out there that's talking shit,

856
00:51:10.670 --> 00:51:15.080
you're talking shit on a false narrative.
It's like some fake quote that someone,

857
00:51:15.380 --> 00:51:17.990
they might've thought they heard that and that sounded like it was more

858
00:51:17.991 --> 00:51:21.800
salacious.
So they put that in quotes.
It's not what he said.
No,
it's fake news.

859
00:51:21.980 --> 00:51:24.320
Fake news all day.
Yeah.
They wrote their own stuffing.

860
00:51:24.321 --> 00:51:26.870
It's either like they're vying for headlines.

861
00:51:26.950 --> 00:51:30.670
It's like Brendan Schaub talking shit to Nate and pointing down,
you know?
Yeah.

862
00:51:30.730 --> 00:51:31.790
And he's saying,
you know,

863
00:51:31.791 --> 00:51:35.420
people were saying you weren't on as this guy can fucking crack so you can,

864
00:51:35.460 --> 00:51:39.530
he's fun to watch.
Yeah.
He's got a really odd,
uh,
style man,

865
00:51:39.860 --> 00:51:43.640
because look at his last fight,
Brandon thatch.
It was kind of a while ago.

866
00:51:44.210 --> 00:51:48.200
Did he win?
He beat that.
Had some submission.
I already cracked them.

867
00:51:48.210 --> 00:51:52.100
They submitted them.
Oh,
that's right on defeated Bravo from rob.

868
00:51:52.610 --> 00:51:53.690
Rob 11 at,
Oh,

869
00:51:54.770 --> 00:51:58.040
this is going to be a good fight because cr by her design,

870
00:51:58.041 --> 00:52:01.000
I love saying that name is a bad motherfucker.
He's a tough dude.

871
00:52:01.001 --> 00:52:01.761
It's tough as they come.

872
00:52:01.761 --> 00:52:04.460
He's one of those weird dudes that like you put your hand on him to interview

873
00:52:04.461 --> 00:52:08.300
him.
He feels like wood,
like Dan Henderson.
Like he looks like a normal dude,

874
00:52:08.450 --> 00:52:12.680
but he's not.
This is a lot of total noise.
Not Walk Amongst us.

875
00:52:12.800 --> 00:52:16.520
They look like normal dudes that you put your hand on me like hey yeah.

876
00:52:18.110 --> 00:52:21.920
2161 and Rob Wilkinson 11.
Oh Man.

877
00:52:21.950 --> 00:52:25.850
That dime piece picture.
Um,
is this Amanda Liao?
Yeah,

878
00:52:26.810 --> 00:52:27.830
that's going to be a fun fight.

879
00:52:28.250 --> 00:52:31.160
I got to stop doing these things when I would come straight from Yoga class,

880
00:52:31.460 --> 00:52:36.200
my first hot yoga,
all sweaty and they'll put makeup on me,

881
00:52:36.201 --> 00:52:39.630
man.
Oh Jesus.
I forgot how bad this is.
Boom.

882
00:52:40.460 --> 00:52:45.320
Boom.
I mean it was tough to watch.
Is there ever been like a super fight?

883
00:52:45.440 --> 00:52:49.790
That was that one sided.
A super fight where everybody thought like,
Holy Shit,

884
00:52:49.791 --> 00:52:51.290
I can't believe this is about to go down.

885
00:52:51.320 --> 00:52:54.770
Look at those people shocked and one person makes the other person who like,

886
00:52:54.800 --> 00:52:59.030
they have no business in there and just over and like it just a career ender,

887
00:52:59.450 --> 00:53:03.380
complete total career ender.
Such a bad idea for her to come back.

888
00:53:04.340 --> 00:53:08.900
Well this was a bad idea for it to come back against this fucking power punch

889
00:53:08.901 --> 00:53:12.780
and monster.
She just hits too goddamn hard.
You know,

890
00:53:12.820 --> 00:53:15.710
I talked to cat about it.
She's cat told me cats and gone.

891
00:53:15.720 --> 00:53:18.770
Oh she told me would hit her.
Yes she did.
And she did.

892
00:53:18.990 --> 00:53:23.330
She got hurt and that first round she was finished her and then Amanda gassed

893
00:53:23.331 --> 00:53:25.730
out.
Yeah.
And Kat was telling,
she's like,
nobody,

894
00:53:25.731 --> 00:53:30.120
we're hitting me that hard before.
I was like,
whoa.
Yeah,

895
00:53:30.121 --> 00:53:31.290
it'd be a fun fight shift.

896
00:53:31.291 --> 00:53:34.560
Chanko when chef Chanko caught Julianne opinion an arm bar,

897
00:53:34.561 --> 00:53:38.860
I was like torture.
That's opinion.
It was like the next big thing.
And then chip,

898
00:53:38.880 --> 00:53:42.810
take cool,
check this out.
Well she can do so many different things.

899
00:53:42.900 --> 00:53:45.600
The thing about Valentino's she can strike,

900
00:53:45.780 --> 00:53:50.780
she's got worldclass Moitai talking shit and they fought once and it was a super

901
00:53:52.591 --> 00:53:54.870
close fight man.
And people think if it was,

902
00:53:54.930 --> 00:53:58.470
if it was a championship fight with five rounds shift Chanko would have probably

903
00:53:58.471 --> 00:54:01.890
won't cause she started come on late and when rounds she started coming on late.

904
00:54:02.220 --> 00:54:02.581
You know what,

905
00:54:02.581 --> 00:54:05.160
I was super impressed with these two right next to each other like that.
Oh,

906
00:54:05.161 --> 00:54:07.650
that's fake fake news.
That's an edit.

907
00:54:08.460 --> 00:54:12.090
One of the things that I was like super impressed with when,
uh,

908
00:54:12.150 --> 00:54:14.730
when I saw her fight Holly,
Ooh,
look at that.

909
00:54:14.850 --> 00:54:18.570
Touching each other's faces and Tim's when left themselves some timbs young

910
00:54:18.590 --> 00:54:21.630
Jamie.
Well you know what man,
she's Brazilian and she's gay.

911
00:54:21.660 --> 00:54:26.610
She do whatever the fuck she wants.
I agree.
Brought those fucking tims.

912
00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:30.240
I was just super impressed with her ability to control the interactions.

913
00:54:30.270 --> 00:54:33.540
She uses that check,
right hook her,
her uh,

914
00:54:33.660 --> 00:54:37.060
her like footwork and like her technique when she was like,

915
00:54:37.100 --> 00:54:41.280
she basically shut down Holly.
Yeah,
I know.
Which was surprising.
Not Easy to do.

916
00:54:41.400 --> 00:54:43.950
I mean,
I dunno what Holly was going into that fight with the,

917
00:54:43.951 --> 00:54:47.310
she was like on a down like maybe didn't have a good camp.

918
00:54:47.340 --> 00:54:48.420
Maybe it wasn't that her best.

919
00:54:48.630 --> 00:54:52.110
But if you look at how good Holly looked against Jermaine Duran to me,

920
00:54:52.440 --> 00:54:55.680
how the fuck is Germane Duran to me?
Not In the top six cause that she dropped,

921
00:54:55.681 --> 00:54:59.550
she left the weight class.
Yeah,
but she's back now.
No,
she's not.
Yes she is.
No,

922
00:54:59.551 --> 00:55:03.060
she can't be.
She's ranked number nine at like at one.
Uh,
uh,

923
00:55:03.690 --> 00:55:06.960
she's back at one 35.
Oh,
you're fucking right.

924
00:55:07.050 --> 00:55:11.850
So she'd left one 45 dropped out.
That you're right because they're like,

925
00:55:11.851 --> 00:55:13.230
what do we do with this chick?
Well,

926
00:55:13.231 --> 00:55:15.520
it's weird because it's like she abandoned her title,

927
00:55:15.521 --> 00:55:19.170
so shouldn't have to fight Cyborg,
which probably a good move,

928
00:55:19.200 --> 00:55:23.230
but also career suicide because now no one respects you.
Yeah.
Right.
Yeah.

929
00:55:23.250 --> 00:55:25.110
Like I get it.
I don't want him to fight cyborg either.

930
00:55:25.111 --> 00:55:28.290
But gifts camp at least take the ass whooping then cut.
Yeah.

931
00:55:28.291 --> 00:55:32.370
I guess the argument is like,
you know,
she's saying that sort of Cyborgs,

932
00:55:32.371 --> 00:55:36.090
a career cheater that doesn't work because she's passed every test and she's

933
00:55:36.110 --> 00:55:39.180
passed the test now doesn't work.
You can't just keep banking on that.

934
00:55:39.510 --> 00:55:42.750
Especially if you look at the way she fought when she fought Tonya evenger.

935
00:55:43.130 --> 00:55:46.710
You know,
she fought very professionally.
She fought with very good.

936
00:55:46.711 --> 00:55:48.210
She beat the brakes off.

937
00:55:48.211 --> 00:55:52.630
That's the breaks off her and she fought like,
um,

938
00:55:52.860 --> 00:55:56.520
it was intelligent.
Like she was very technical.
The way she pros to fight,

939
00:55:56.521 --> 00:55:57.960
she just tried to Morocco.
I was like,

940
00:55:57.961 --> 00:56:02.790
this is a mature cyborg murder her though for us for sure.
Make it exciting.

941
00:56:02.791 --> 00:56:07.230
But if you,
if you're a Cyborg fan,
you like that cerebral Cyborg,

942
00:56:07.310 --> 00:56:11.910
she'd just be so tough to beat but also be the Mike Tyson of women fighting and

943
00:56:12.240 --> 00:56:16.950
Merker for us.
That's what you're there for.
Hats,

944
00:56:17.100 --> 00:56:21.100
hats off to her.
She just talking about Zombie mom would not help.

945
00:56:21.290 --> 00:56:25.900
How tough is that girl?
She would not go away.
Huh?
She would not go away.

946
00:56:26.290 --> 00:56:31.240
So got into.
But I think she also Cyborg.
She caught Cyborg.
Would a couple shots,

947
00:56:31.250 --> 00:56:33.320
a couple of punches.
Not a whole lot on them,
but yeah,

948
00:56:33.380 --> 00:56:34.990
you got to make sure your mind,

949
00:56:34.991 --> 00:56:37.480
your p's and q's and she knew eventually she's going to beat her down.

950
00:56:37.481 --> 00:56:41.890
She had five whole rounds.
But Jermaine stepping away from it like that,

951
00:56:41.920 --> 00:56:45.430
the real shame was Jermaine would have been a fucking very interesting,

952
00:56:45.730 --> 00:56:49.720
fun fight.
Germane.
It's super technical and she's phenomenal striker.

953
00:56:49.721 --> 00:56:52.010
But now Holly comes right on and slide.

954
00:56:52.120 --> 00:56:55.760
That should cause I think Holly won that fight.
I thought one,

955
00:56:55.850 --> 00:56:59.190
I had Holly winning and also uh,
Jermaine also,
you know,

956
00:56:59.250 --> 00:57:02.610
she had some suspect punches after the browns,

957
00:57:02.620 --> 00:57:05.340
like they should pick and points from her side probably won that fight.

958
00:57:05.341 --> 00:57:08.500
So now Karma catching up the way things work out.

959
00:57:08.501 --> 00:57:11.350
Life works out and he got Hollywood cyborg hopefully.
Yeah,

960
00:57:11.351 --> 00:57:12.370
that's going to be interesting.

961
00:57:12.400 --> 00:57:16.420
I thought it's a fight if isn't Holly Holly scheduled for to fight Cyborg if

962
00:57:16.421 --> 00:57:19.990
they scheduled it?
The rumor was Ms Square Garden,
but nothing scheduled yet.

963
00:57:21.970 --> 00:57:25.660
I think that,
you know,
with Jermaine she was,

964
00:57:25.780 --> 00:57:28.900
she came out in the first rounds and controlled it.

965
00:57:28.960 --> 00:57:32.860
She controlled the fight but then she started to slow down.
You know,

966
00:57:32.861 --> 00:57:36.790
and I think part of it,
I mean who the fuck knows could be pressure.
It could be,

967
00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:41.530
you know,
whatever it is.
But that's when Holly clipped her with that question.

968
00:57:41.531 --> 00:57:44.680
Mark kick remedy.
She claimed Dairylea she's Shinder with that.

969
00:57:44.950 --> 00:57:47.950
And then Holly dropped her with a straight left is Jermaine was coming forward,

970
00:57:48.210 --> 00:57:52.690
did the most damage and she got hit late twice,
twice.
I felt he was her fight.

971
00:57:52.710 --> 00:57:55.750
I really do.
And that's why should we should fight Cyborg,
which,

972
00:57:55.810 --> 00:57:59.140
but it pisses me off the best in the world.
She should be two division champion.

973
00:57:59.890 --> 00:58:04.730
She really Shelly.
Yes.
Yeah.
Yes.
It's dirty man.
It is dirty.
Um,

974
00:58:04.750 --> 00:58:07.810
and then have Jermaine just step away from the title after that.
It's like,

975
00:58:07.811 --> 00:58:11.250
oh come on.
This is crazy.
Some bitch stuff.

976
00:58:11.290 --> 00:58:13.750
They definitely should have taken the point away for the second time.

977
00:58:13.810 --> 00:58:16.680
Definitely 100% that's why the hell should be,
yeah,
I agree.

978
00:58:16.690 --> 00:58:19.060
That alone would be the champ.
And I think,

979
00:58:19.120 --> 00:58:23.470
I just think that like rounds where like Holly flatlander with that head kick

980
00:58:23.710 --> 00:58:26.290
and then dropped her again with that straight left.
I'm like,

981
00:58:26.291 --> 00:58:28.390
those are two big moments in the fight.
The most.

982
00:58:28.510 --> 00:58:31.960
Anybody was hurt in the fight with those moments that should show in the

983
00:58:31.961 --> 00:58:35.790
scorecard.
I don't know what system they were using.
His New York.
Oh,
the oldsters.

984
00:58:35.840 --> 00:58:38.540
It's like,
wait,
what happened?
I missed that.
And then you know,

985
00:58:38.590 --> 00:58:41.660
especially with taking the points away,
cause that was in Vegas or Kelly,

986
00:58:42.140 --> 00:58:43.580
Holly Hollywood have won that fight.
Who'd,

987
00:58:43.630 --> 00:58:47.300
how bout the scorecards for the Connor may are there five hot

988
00:58:48.970 --> 00:58:52.820
Jesus Christ one round.
How crazy is that?
Those are out of your mind.

989
00:58:52.821 --> 00:58:55.810
And Floyd was like,
come on man.
One round.
Come on.
First of all,

990
00:58:55.960 --> 00:58:58.240
Max Kellerman owes you some Dick pics or something.

991
00:58:58.250 --> 00:59:02.620
Doesn't at least a dick pic hasn't had the very least.
He actually,

992
00:59:02.650 --> 00:59:06.700
he actually got regret.
Her will not land a meaningful punch.
We're round.
What?

993
00:59:06.701 --> 00:59:09.940
Are you fucking crazy?
No,
he goes,
he won't land a single punch.

994
00:59:10.180 --> 00:59:11.470
He was just as bad for boxing.

995
00:59:11.500 --> 00:59:13.990
He clipped him with a good left upper cut in the first round.

996
00:59:14.410 --> 00:59:17.800
Gouche and they're like,
Floyd allowed him to do that.
Oh yeah.

997
00:59:17.980 --> 00:59:21.980
If you know anything about Floyd,
he's not allowing.
So a fucking hit him in

998
00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:23.960
<v 1>the face.
It's so stupid.</v>

999
00:59:24.950 --> 00:59:28.880
Him and Brian Barbarina should have a beach dad bod contest.
Yes.

1000
00:59:29.330 --> 00:59:31.280
The two of them cause yes.

1001
00:59:31.310 --> 00:59:36.310
Show up on the beach with a fucking six powerful Afghanistan while I was on one

1002
00:59:36.651 --> 00:59:38.120
of those fucking fold up aluminum

1003
00:59:41.090 --> 00:59:45.410
with the Mesh sack lunches.
Fucking ham sandwiches.
I'm telling you man,

1004
00:59:45.411 --> 00:59:49.430
that dude is made out of bricks.
He had so fucking hard and he's,

1005
00:59:49.460 --> 00:59:53.810
he's literally like one of the,
like the densest dude's didn't rob six.

1006
00:59:53.811 --> 00:59:54.644
Three though.

1007
00:59:54.680 --> 00:59:59.680
Tall Dude and 85 it's 25 oh by her design.

1008
01:00:00.111 --> 01:00:04.220
I used to fight 70 now he's at fighting an 85 I a small lady.
Fiver.
Yeah man.

1009
01:00:04.250 --> 01:00:08.690
Maybe took this fight on short notice.
How tall is he?

1010
01:00:09.470 --> 01:00:14.470
Would they say five 11 five 10 if you look with 60 he's built and then think of

1011
01:00:15.050 --> 01:00:18.920
Yoel Romero did the same way class.
Well yeah,
doing like that man.

1012
01:00:19.910 --> 01:00:23.030
That's how it has to be done.
They didn't really is.
That's the world we live.

1013
01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:27.980
It is what?
It is not fair.
It's not occasionally eat lions.

1014
01:00:31.070 --> 01:00:33.880
It just just doesn't happen.
It doesn't happen.

1015
01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:36.770
Lighting just doesn't work like that.
It just is what it is.

1016
01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:41.630
You know that due to place Tyrian Lannister is not going to kick your ass no

1017
01:00:41.631 --> 01:00:44.000
matter how much he puts his mind to it.
It's never happening.

1018
01:00:44.210 --> 01:00:47.990
It's just not God cr.

1019
01:00:48.380 --> 01:00:51.320
That's what a great name can.
I haven't seen him fight at first.
Have her man.

1020
01:00:51.950 --> 01:00:56.330
He's been around for a long fucking time.
How old is he?
He looks dirty.

1021
01:00:56.331 --> 01:00:59.420
Six has been a 40 it was he 42 Jamie?

1022
01:01:00.350 --> 01:01:01.940
I'm a fuck like to every bit of 42

1023
01:01:03.030 --> 01:01:03.840
<v 5>yeah,</v>

1024
01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:08.520
<v 1>I would say he's 36 I'm going to say 37 what is it?
Three 33</v>

1025
01:01:09.290 --> 01:01:12.590
<v 5>whoa.
What's he eating?
Well,</v>

1026
01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:21.270
<v 1>it's like got to change up.
You die at home.</v>

1027
01:01:21.380 --> 01:01:24.040
I feel like the international ring girls are kind of killing it.

1028
01:01:24.100 --> 01:01:26.060
They're repeating the American ones.
I feel like late.

1029
01:01:26.150 --> 01:01:30.180
Are you with the old faithful inn?
My friends.
You're Europe.

1030
01:01:30.550 --> 01:01:31.920
I also enjoy them too.

1031
01:01:32.300 --> 01:01:37.300
I'm just saying international step in the game up for 53 first round.

1032
01:01:37.451 --> 01:01:42.380
52 51 50 they have the clock on the screen,
right?
Yup.

1033
01:01:42.510 --> 01:01:46.940
Okay.
Jamie is on the ball.
Jamie gets this.
He'd been locked up and shit.

1034
01:01:47.140 --> 01:01:51.250
Making good use that extra 15 pounds.
We had another hiccup on the flight path.

1035
01:01:51.640 --> 01:01:55.480
What is he eating?
You're talking about a,
it gets him so big.

1036
01:01:56.880 --> 01:01:58.600
Uh,
yeah.
It's like,

1037
01:01:58.660 --> 01:02:03.640
imagine it as much as you have to train to be an MMA fighter and he's older.

1038
01:02:03.641 --> 01:02:08.170
Sometimes genetics go fuck that.
Hoe.
Getting the dad bod 33 that's not that old.

1039
01:02:08.530 --> 01:02:13.450
Oh Shit.
I think it's just wars.
You know,
saw Australia,
maybe Jesus Christ,

1040
01:02:13.451 --> 01:02:18.130
man,
relax is the Australian or English.
He's Australian.
Rob Wilkinson,

1041
01:02:18.300 --> 01:02:20.160
Australian.
This good,

1042
01:02:20.161 --> 01:02:23.940
good striking composure for who Wilkinson.

1043
01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:28.440
But bar desire just throws Brexit man.
Yeah,
he's there to scrap.
Dangerous.

1044
01:02:28.441 --> 01:02:33.150
Very dangerous guy because he's throwing everything in every shot and if he can

1045
01:02:33.151 --> 01:02:36.990
catch you inside the first round,
especially,
you know he's going to hurt you.

1046
01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:41.820
You know,
the first round.
So dangerous.
Hell yeah.
It's dangerous.

1047
01:02:42.180 --> 01:02:45.870
Especially finding a guy like that.
Yeah,
but he's got to take these breaks.

1048
01:02:46.260 --> 01:02:48.780
You know when you sprint like that when you're that guy.
Ooh.

1049
01:02:48.781 --> 01:02:51.720
And I hit well a yes,
right.
Like that.

1050
01:02:51.721 --> 01:02:55.020
Cause the shorter guy that Rob's fucking wade longer and ranger.

1051
01:02:55.260 --> 01:02:57.750
Hey Rob for sure.
Get the job out there though so you keep them back.

1052
01:02:57.751 --> 01:02:59.370
There you go.
It's always been his style though.

1053
01:02:59.430 --> 01:03:02.520
Borrower design has always been kind of a reserve occur that's 70 though.

1054
01:03:02.540 --> 01:03:05.060
It's going to be way more easier than these 85 months or so.

1055
01:03:05.061 --> 01:03:08.720
And that Jim Against Luke Rockhold.
Yikes.
Well I can't imagine this is a,

1056
01:03:08.750 --> 01:03:12.510
the way class is going to stay in.
I think if I'm looking at his body right here,

1057
01:03:12.620 --> 01:03:15.150
he's carrying around a lot of,
oh we just clipped him with that right hand.

1058
01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:17.040
He's carrying around a lot of body fat.

1059
01:03:17.190 --> 01:03:19.980
I feel like this is probably a short notice fight fight a guests,

1060
01:03:20.010 --> 01:03:24.090
but I'm just guessing he's had a long career too so I might just be like,

1061
01:03:24.091 --> 01:03:26.760
I'm sick of cutting weight could be right.

1062
01:03:26.970 --> 01:03:31.970
I can't perform at my best and dude start getting like kidney problems and weird

1063
01:03:32.191 --> 01:03:34.590
shit happening with their body when their,

1064
01:03:34.591 --> 01:03:39.210
their bodies is shutting down from the weight loss when that's a kept DC out of

1065
01:03:39.211 --> 01:03:41.190
the fucking Olympics.
I know man.

1066
01:03:41.610 --> 01:03:46.530
But also like with the weight cut it.
I think it's harder on females.
Yeah,

1067
01:03:46.531 --> 01:03:50.600
I hear that.
It's so rough,
man.
I hear that a lot from them.
They don't,

1068
01:03:50.610 --> 01:03:54.210
some of them get big and they got to cut weight and with your thyroid and all

1069
01:03:54.211 --> 01:03:57.150
that stuff.
I used to take down.
Look,
it's,
it takes it back.

1070
01:03:57.350 --> 01:04:00.150
Didn't get the hook in right away though.
Oh,

1071
01:04:00.151 --> 01:04:05.070
nice knee to the body and drops down again.
Good timing to the shorter guy down.

1072
01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:08.850
He took them down once.
It just didn't get that Hook quick enough.

1073
01:04:09.530 --> 01:04:13.680
It says that uh,
crs the only five,
four times in five years.
Wow.

1074
01:04:13.710 --> 01:04:16.470
Well I think he had some shoulder surgery.
He has got damn times.

1075
01:04:16.471 --> 01:04:19.740
So it sounds like,
I think he had shoulder surgery.
Jamie,

1076
01:04:19.741 --> 01:04:23.570
see if you can find that.
Those injuries and setbacks.
It doesn't say which.
Yeah,

1077
01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:25.620
I'm pretty sure he had shoulder surgery.

1078
01:04:25.980 --> 01:04:28.740
It looks like you can tell like he has a scar on the shoulder.

1079
01:04:28.741 --> 01:04:30.690
The front of the shoulder can also be,

1080
01:04:32.020 --> 01:04:36.540
it could be some latent caveman jeans.
I got some of those.

1081
01:04:36.810 --> 01:04:40.150
I got weird patches of hair that Donnie and belong there anymore.
Do you?
Yeah.

1082
01:04:40.151 --> 01:04:43.380
For humans,
I feel like guys would lock testosterone.

1083
01:04:43.381 --> 01:04:48.300
Have more hair that fair to say?
Yeah.
Not on the top of your head though.
Yeah.

1084
01:04:48.460 --> 01:04:51.120
No pens everywhere else.
Like your body.
Yeah.

1085
01:04:51.121 --> 01:04:55.110
Like your body is a shitload of here.
Like,
well that's my [inaudible].
Yeah,
yeah,

1086
01:04:55.111 --> 01:04:58.530
yeah.
That's why I get super scared when I see those super hairy Russians.
Yeah.

1087
01:04:58.531 --> 01:05:02.070
They freak me out too.
Like the dudes that like their whole back,
his hair,

1088
01:05:02.730 --> 01:05:06.510
just their legs.
I thought I lost good ways.
I looked at shogun like,
well sir,

1089
01:05:06.511 --> 01:05:10.740
you have here all over your shoulders.
Yeah.
Chia pets.
That's scary.
Do you know?

1090
01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:15.690
Well,
we'll see how it goes for the fucking
wow.
He got the two.

1091
01:05:15.720 --> 01:05:19.390
He might have it here.
Uh,
he doesn't know how to get out.

1092
01:05:19.540 --> 01:05:20.373
It doesn't know how to get out.

1093
01:05:20.580 --> 01:05:25.300
See how it's just strange and you give them that data role,
son.

1094
01:05:25.690 --> 01:05:30.610
Oh,
he's okay.
He's okay.
Wow.
He might,
he might get through this.
Wow.
Kevin Tubbs.

1095
01:05:30.950 --> 01:05:34.480
He's tough.
He's very tall man.
Probably and flat from Australia to gut.

1096
01:05:34.481 --> 01:05:37.710
In Rotterdam,
you get choked out like that.
It's probably a long flight.
Right?
Oh,

1097
01:05:38.270 --> 01:05:42.890
naps.
I don't want that either.
Wrestler.
I don't want no part of that.
I want that.

1098
01:05:43.850 --> 01:05:48.660
So preposterous throw.
Um,
look up Bruce.
Dom,
Chia have.

1099
01:05:49.480 --> 01:05:52.870
Look at that guy.
That was that big giant.
Do the date.
Jay David Haye fought.

1100
01:05:52.900 --> 01:05:57.820
How has he and I end game if that's valid.
Yeah.
Holy look at that here.

1101
01:05:57.940 --> 01:05:59.980
Yeah,
he's a straight up gorilla.
He ends up,

1102
01:06:00.350 --> 01:06:04.690
the only thing he plucks is his eyebrow.
So this is [inaudible].
He's a fuck.

1103
01:06:05.410 --> 01:06:08.150
I don't know if that's him.
That's another Harry Rahel.
You get

1104
01:06:11.360 --> 01:06:13.580
Russian Harry wrestlers.
I feel,

1105
01:06:14.170 --> 01:06:18.430
feel like these dudes have crazy to Sasha on the fucking Harry.

1106
01:06:18.431 --> 01:06:23.380
Like a gorilla.
Most of muscle have girls for kids.
Hmm.
That's interesting.

1107
01:06:24.940 --> 01:06:28.150
This could just be straight up was that legal signed legal Harry backs.

1108
01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:31.990
But I feel like guys a lot to SAS drone.
Not a lot of here.

1109
01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:36.220
Harry is fuck chest,
back and shoulders and usually I have girls.

1110
01:06:36.450 --> 01:06:41.220
Kind of makes sense.
It's science.
Weird science

1111
01:06:44.020 --> 01:06:48.340
dude.
I thought after our last podcast that so many people hit me up about large

1112
01:06:48.341 --> 01:06:51.640
Marge,
everyone remembers that bitch.

1113
01:06:52.420 --> 01:06:56.960
I wonder if she's dead.
She's gotta be Marge.
Marge.
This was 85.
She was like,

1114
01:06:57.950 --> 01:07:01.960
ah,
she's deep in her nineties.
If she's alive,

1115
01:07:02.080 --> 01:07:04.300
she might be killing it.
Maybe she has like a podcast.

1116
01:07:04.301 --> 01:07:08.970
The large Marge passed away in 88.
Ah,
a couple of years.

1117
01:07:08.971 --> 01:07:13.040
Then when she died from coke and whores,
she's got them moving money.

1118
01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:20.290
That movie man,
she fucking went Johnny Depp and started buying castles and chin.

1119
01:07:20.650 --> 01:07:24.610
I was reading about this chicken South Africa.
She's a student and uh,

1120
01:07:24.670 --> 01:07:29.670
they're supposed to put like $100 in her account and instead,

1121
01:07:29.801 --> 01:07:32.080
or thousand dollars in her account.
Instead they put a million,

1122
01:07:32.650 --> 01:07:36.310
they put $1 million in her account.
And so she went off for like a month,

1123
01:07:36.490 --> 01:07:40.100
was just buying clothes and shoes and taking her friends on trips and all that

1124
01:07:40.101 --> 01:07:44.470
shit.
And then they found it out and then she screwed.
I spent 60 grand though.

1125
01:07:44.471 --> 01:07:48.720
They said,
yeah,
but in South Africa,
that shit is,
that's,
that's like 60 grand.

1126
01:07:48.730 --> 01:07:52.690
You're fucking p diddy at gold houses and shit showing up with designer clothes

1127
01:07:52.691 --> 01:07:54.310
at school and they're like,
whoa,
what's going on?

1128
01:07:54.570 --> 01:07:59.570
Just bought a new iPhone seven Gucci shoes and Shit and tarps.
Yeah.

1129
01:07:59.850 --> 01:08:02.050
Paul and out of control showed up in a new kid.

1130
01:08:02.051 --> 01:08:06.940
How silly is that new camera with the gold teeth?
Gold fronts.
Skirts,

1131
01:08:06.990 --> 01:08:11.960
spinners for teeth.
Oh,

1132
01:08:12.010 --> 01:08:15.000
how's that work though?
Cause the banks mess up and you're like,
oh,
fuck it.

1133
01:08:15.110 --> 01:08:19.220
I'm going sizzler.
And then they go,
no,
you're not yours money.

1134
01:08:19.280 --> 01:08:22.880
It's like you can't fuck up man.
They would sue you for it.

1135
01:08:22.940 --> 01:08:26.910
And if they won in court,
then they're just like,
take it from you.
Okay.
But some,

1136
01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:30.340
it's not a law or it's not,
or like it's a civil law or something about,
um,

1137
01:08:30.680 --> 01:08:32.990
doing the right thing.
Getting money that,
I forget the word,

1138
01:08:32.991 --> 01:08:36.890
I just finished reading,
reading it like you're getting it.
Uh,
Africa,
look at it.

1139
01:08:36.891 --> 01:08:40.790
What do I gotta return the camera with fucking spinners on it like that.

1140
01:08:40.820 --> 01:08:42.480
I own that thing,
man.
Amen.

1141
01:08:42.530 --> 01:08:47.510
Did you hear that Nate Diaz wants $20 million for the rematch with Conor s he

1142
01:08:47.511 --> 01:08:50.960
and he should get 20 to 30 million.
Do you think that it's,

1143
01:08:50.990 --> 01:08:54.410
how many paper view buys?
Do you think that that fight would be worth?

1144
01:08:54.560 --> 01:08:58.580
1.5 now.
Yeah.
Maybe.
Maybe more now.

1145
01:08:59.240 --> 01:09:04.100
Maybe more now.
Cause let me ask you this,
Joe.
What slit?
Say Nate fought.

1146
01:09:04.730 --> 01:09:08.060
Let's say Nate fights the one of Kevin Lee.
Tony first and in there,

1147
01:09:08.061 --> 01:09:09.420
the main event paper view.

1148
01:09:09.500 --> 01:09:12.290
How many papers you buys as Nate Diaz do without Conner?

1149
01:09:13.070 --> 01:09:17.770
Well not as many.
Not even close.
Not even close,
right?
It's,
it's,

1150
01:09:17.830 --> 01:09:21.230
it's a big kind of thing.
But the big fight for Conor is Nate.

1151
01:09:21.260 --> 01:09:24.860
Like if Connor fought Kevin Lee,
how many pay views would he get you again?

1152
01:09:25.370 --> 01:09:28.660
He might.
You're right,
you're right.
You're right.
You look up.
All Congress writes,

1153
01:09:28.670 --> 01:09:30.660
he's never done less than a million ever.
You're right.

1154
01:09:30.990 --> 01:09:35.120
So he's the Floyd Mayweather fight MMA.
Now we freeze.

1155
01:09:36.490 --> 01:09:40.640
God dammit.
God dammit.
Fipass son of a bitch.

1156
01:09:41.240 --> 01:09:45.920
Conspiracy theory.
Snoop Casanova's Fitch.
It's snoop cast.

1157
01:09:46.340 --> 01:09:49.870
Okay.
They fucked us.
We're,
we're sitting here frozen out later.

1158
01:09:53.420 --> 01:09:57.850
We will.
Oh my God.
Oh,
we're back.
We're back in low.
Done.
No,

1159
01:09:57.860 --> 01:10:00.800
it's dead.
It's dead again.
We've got a streaming issue.

1160
01:10:01.490 --> 01:10:05.120
Some shit is going down or there's such a demand for this.

1161
01:10:05.121 --> 01:10:07.430
It's fucked up like Mayweather.
Mcgregor.

1162
01:10:08.630 --> 01:10:10.610
They don't know how to handle the overload.

1163
01:10:10.770 --> 01:10:12.980
They only expected 50 people and they got a hundred.

1164
01:10:14.990 --> 01:10:19.610
They'll how dare you.
Yeah,
this is ridiculous.
Um,
um,
yeah,
but I think Nate,

1165
01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:22.940
rightfully so.
She gets that fights can be the biggest paper of all time.

1166
01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:23.571
I really do.

1167
01:10:23.571 --> 01:10:27.170
I think the trilogies you can be because of for MMA frame may for him and may

1168
01:10:27.171 --> 01:10:31.730
because of commerce.
Right?
He's bigger than ever.
Biggest combat sports.

1169
01:10:34.660 --> 01:10:38.210
That's a long flight back to Australia,
like going out like this kid's tough man.

1170
01:10:38.450 --> 01:10:42.980
Oh,
he's getting rock 'em sock.
'Em robots.
I stop it now.
It's close.

1171
01:10:43.130 --> 01:10:46.610
Certainly close.
Oh,
hold up.
When you're sitting Indian style,

1172
01:10:46.700 --> 01:10:49.220
probably stop it now,
man.
He's getting up.
He's getting up.

1173
01:10:49.490 --> 01:10:54.160
Getting up with his ass.
What?
Go ahead and stop it.
Stop it now.
Stop it.

1174
01:10:54.290 --> 01:10:58.640
Stop.
Stop it.
Stop the fucking fight.
Come on,
look,
look at,

1175
01:10:58.680 --> 01:11:01.490
Oh my God.
Damn it.
Like he didn't need that.

1176
01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:03.830
I mean the referee collided with him and hurt him.

1177
01:11:03.831 --> 01:11:07.980
He the head where the head bottom.
Wow.
She are shut off to Afghanistan.

1178
01:11:07.981 --> 01:11:09.290
He the dude can crack man.

1179
01:11:09.291 --> 01:11:12.620
So I'm saying the dude can look forward to seeing them fight that guy team the

1180
01:11:12.621 --> 01:11:16.590
white 2018 you don't want to do coke with that guy with the white suit or you do

1181
01:11:17.660 --> 01:11:22.080
or look at all those people.
I do coke with that poor guy.

1182
01:11:22.140 --> 01:11:23.250
The ref gave,
not cut

1183
01:11:25.230 --> 01:11:27.470
but with Nate I think that the fight that,

1184
01:11:27.900 --> 01:11:30.150
that's the thing with this fight and that's why I don't think you're gonna see

1185
01:11:30.151 --> 01:11:34.140
it happen very soon cause both Nate and Connor realize how much power they have

1186
01:11:34.650 --> 01:11:37.560
and you can't just go from with the old rules anymore.

1187
01:11:37.800 --> 01:11:42.240
They liked the Connor is changed the dynamics of the fight game for the better

1188
01:11:42.241 --> 01:11:45.420
for the fighters.
It's a great thing.
It is a great thing.

1189
01:11:45.421 --> 01:11:48.600
I just wonder like how much knee can actually get.

1190
01:11:49.980 --> 01:11:52.950
Definitely because what they say,
I think report said between the two fights,

1191
01:11:52.951 --> 01:11:55.170
he made around 2.5 million to fight him twice.

1192
01:11:55.171 --> 01:11:59.460
Now he made 2 million plus to fight him both times.
Both Times.

1193
01:11:59.461 --> 01:12:02.460
So it's 4 million.
So 4 million total.
That's what I'm reading.

1194
01:12:02.550 --> 01:12:06.900
I did not talk to Nate.
I did not talk.
I read this,
so I thought I made two maybe.

1195
01:12:06.901 --> 01:12:08.970
Yeah,
you might be right.
Maybe I miss quoted that.

1196
01:12:08.971 --> 01:12:11.820
So maybe it's two and two or two and a half.
Two and a half.
Either way.

1197
01:12:11.880 --> 01:12:15.780
So say made 4 million.
There's no way in the world you can say,
hey Nate,

1198
01:12:15.990 --> 01:12:18.450
fight Conor and the biggest fight of all time trilogy,

1199
01:12:18.630 --> 01:12:22.110
Connor's going to get 40 million during get two and a half again.

1200
01:12:23.010 --> 01:12:24.330
There's no way that happens.

1201
01:12:24.630 --> 01:12:29.460
Both guys realize the magnitude of this fight and he made $4 million in a year.

1202
01:12:29.550 --> 01:12:31.440
So like how much money does he have leftover?

1203
01:12:31.470 --> 01:12:35.880
You probably got $1 million plus just sitting in the bank doing nothing.

1204
01:12:36.780 --> 01:12:37.920
So what do you know what I'm saying?

1205
01:12:37.921 --> 01:12:41.490
So the dynamics have shifted towards the fighters for first time.

1206
01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:45.840
Now if you the UFC,
how do you make this work with Conor?

1207
01:12:46.560 --> 01:12:49.500
Because he's not fighting guys anymore for five 10 million.
You can't,

1208
01:12:49.501 --> 01:12:52.770
when you have over a hundred million dollars in the bank and the biggest star of

1209
01:12:52.771 --> 01:12:55.860
all time,
what do you think the most common made in the UFC fighters?

1210
01:12:56.580 --> 01:12:59.910
10 Mil Pri you think so 10 12 Mil Max.

1211
01:12:59.970 --> 01:13:04.970
So now you think he can get like probably like 30 at least right at leap ends on

1212
01:13:06.751 --> 01:13:09.600
how many papers if you buy otherwise why are you doing it?
What if he gets like,

1213
01:13:09.810 --> 01:13:12.510
what if Nate and Connor gets 3 million paid reviews?

1214
01:13:13.140 --> 01:13:17.210
It's not out of the question.
It's not,
it's a stretch when I stretch.

1215
01:13:17.550 --> 01:13:20.820
But if Nate can talk the right amount of Shit,

1216
01:13:22.350 --> 01:13:25.530
you know,
and people get excited about,
honestly right now for Connor,

1217
01:13:25.770 --> 01:13:29.550
what else is there that's even close?
The first fight in MMA,

1218
01:13:29.670 --> 01:13:32.310
what else do you call it?
The only argument is you can say commerce.

1219
01:13:32.311 --> 01:13:33.210
The only draw.

1220
01:13:33.270 --> 01:13:38.040
He can fight Billy from Afghanistan and still get 2 million paper.

1221
01:13:38.040 --> 01:13:42.750
You buys or breaking Millie.
You let Conor fight Pauline,
Mylan,
Naji and Dublin.

1222
01:13:43.470 --> 01:13:48.420
See if I'm Connor and I have McGregor promotions,
I'm going,
wait a second,

1223
01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:52.130
I'm going to fight this monster.
Nate Diaz.
You want to pay me 10 million?

1224
01:13:52.140 --> 01:13:55.500
You wear Reeboks or I'm just going to go to Dublin.

1225
01:13:55.501 --> 01:13:59.070
Me and he sell this 70,000 state amount.
I'm just gonna take all of it.

1226
01:14:00.450 --> 01:14:05.350
You have to.
He goes,
Whoa,
Whoa,
hey,
hey chill.
He's still got it.

1227
01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:07.880
Some sort of a,
they must have all checks coming up.

1228
01:14:08.460 --> 01:14:10.470
They have some sort of a deal for boxing too.

1229
01:14:10.740 --> 01:14:13.660
You know they have the zoo for boxing shirt that Dana was wearing.

1230
01:14:13.700 --> 01:14:17.500
It might be putting my skeptical hip eyes like the shirt and I'd rock get myself

1231
01:14:17.501 --> 01:14:22.300
cause like zoo funds.
However Mcgregor promotions I'd assume as commerce thing.

1232
01:14:23.460 --> 01:14:26.580
Really.
You think he's in cahoots with the,
with the UFC?

1233
01:14:27.670 --> 01:14:28.720
I would think he has to be.

1234
01:14:29.830 --> 01:14:32.650
I don't think he would make a deal with McGregor promotions.

1235
01:14:32.651 --> 01:14:35.200
I think you made a deal with what he's saying.

1236
01:14:35.490 --> 01:14:38.620
You can buy that superblock zoo for boxing tee shirt.
25 bucks.

1237
01:14:38.710 --> 01:14:42.880
Why does it say Dana White Zoo for boxing?
Ti Does Dana white come with it?

1238
01:14:43.620 --> 01:14:47.530
It's a false average picture of him.
This is fake news.
I,

1239
01:14:47.720 --> 01:14:49.760
I'd rock that button.
Hey,
by the way,
um,

1240
01:14:50.650 --> 01:14:54.310
I would imagine you have some sort of a deal.
Okay.
So let's say you have a deal.

1241
01:14:54.311 --> 01:14:55.001
Think about this Joe.

1242
01:14:55.001 --> 01:14:59.920
So let's say Connor and Dana have a deal with the McGregor promotions and like,

1243
01:14:59.921 --> 01:15:03.890
I,
your next fight,
we're going to cope,
promote with you.
Well,

1244
01:15:03.910 --> 01:15:05.530
how's that gonna work now?
So then you're,

1245
01:15:05.540 --> 01:15:07.630
you're it this huge fight and Nate's like,

1246
01:15:07.631 --> 01:15:10.760
hold up if he's gonna make all this money that I can,

1247
01:15:10.761 --> 01:15:14.560
I know where we're in cahoots with him.
Do you mean for the UFC?
Yeah.
No,

1248
01:15:14.561 --> 01:15:16.900
I don't think he'll cope.
Promote for the UFC.
I don't think so.
No.

1249
01:15:16.901 --> 01:15:17.621
But I think it would cope.

1250
01:15:17.621 --> 01:15:21.680
Promote if you had a Pauline Mala Naji boxing match and doable and in fucking

1251
01:15:21.720 --> 01:15:25.590
Dublin gammy brand.
Do you see that?
You've been,

1252
01:15:26.170 --> 01:15:28.540
I want to see everything,
Dude.
I want to see snails race.

1253
01:15:33.340 --> 01:15:37.980
It's Hillary takers.
The fight is DNA Diaz fight.
That's the fight.

1254
01:15:38.090 --> 01:15:40.750
The fight,
but is it the fight as far as a business?

1255
01:15:40.780 --> 01:15:43.960
Cause if Collin learned anything from Floyd,
you know that when you fight,

1256
01:15:43.961 --> 01:15:47.860
Floyd Floyd is the businessman.
He's zone promoted,
he's everything.

1257
01:15:48.130 --> 01:15:51.820
Connor has his own promotional.
Now he's the businessman now.
So Connor's going,

1258
01:15:51.821 --> 01:15:54.550
listen,
what are we doing here?
What do you guys want to do?

1259
01:15:54.700 --> 01:15:59.320
Maybe if the UFC contract that Connor has runs out,

1260
01:15:59.770 --> 01:16:01.900
maybe they make some new crazy,
ridiculously lucrative.

1261
01:16:02.600 --> 01:16:06.520
That contract doesn't matter if it's out or not because the game has changed.

1262
01:16:06.550 --> 01:16:09.370
Hmm,
interesting.
Yeah,
you don't,

1263
01:16:09.400 --> 01:16:14.400
there's no way you would keep going with that current contract and the way by

1264
01:16:15.840 --> 01:16:17.590
Mcgregor sports and entertainment limited.

1265
01:16:17.890 --> 01:16:22.210
The notorious Conor McGregor and notorious.
Why did you pull that up?

1266
01:16:22.211 --> 01:16:22.901
I don't give a fuck.

1267
01:16:22.901 --> 01:16:27.760
This is a company that it's officially exists and they own these things and it's

1268
01:16:27.761 --> 01:16:31.070
all Connor stuff.
Yeah,
it's registered in his name.
Not mean.

1269
01:16:31.100 --> 01:16:35.290
That could be like a tee shirt company.
It could be,

1270
01:16:35.291 --> 01:16:38.980
but it's all these dick,
I don't know.
Whatever.
I'm sure he's got something.

1271
01:16:39.490 --> 01:16:42.880
I mean,
must have some sort of a,
but also Dana White.

1272
01:16:43.210 --> 01:16:45.970
I don't know about the guys that dummy with Dana White's not stupid enough to

1273
01:16:45.971 --> 01:16:48.280
let Connor do all this and not be involved in it.

1274
01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:51.070
He's not even really sure it make your own thing,
man.
Do your thing,
buddy.

1275
01:16:51.100 --> 01:16:55.870
There's no way.
Hm.
Interesting.
I know either way,

1276
01:16:55.871 --> 01:16:58.030
whatever he does and interesting.
I know.

1277
01:16:58.300 --> 01:17:03.300
I would like to see him box Paul while Nate just keeps eating tacos and going to

1278
01:17:03.821 --> 01:17:08.260
Cabo doing tequila shots.
I really like the fights going to go away.

1279
01:17:08.650 --> 01:17:10.330
It's not to go away.
I disagree.
Yeah.

1280
01:17:10.410 --> 01:17:14.450
Fights around the year that you think they it.
So,
I don't know,
man.
I think it,

1281
01:17:14.770 --> 01:17:18.260
if Nate wants to just chill and just train and have a good time.

1282
01:17:18.320 --> 01:17:22.430
The fights there in a year.
I don't think so.
I think if Connor stays active,

1283
01:17:22.431 --> 01:17:25.200
I guess with Nate,
what's up?
How are you going to stay in the limelight?
Like,

1284
01:17:25.490 --> 01:17:28.100
yeah,
he's fighting Nate Diaz again.
Uh,

1285
01:17:28.101 --> 01:17:31.570
they fought over two years ago called the heights,
not there.

1286
01:17:31.680 --> 01:17:35.450
Pauline Mala Naji in a boxing match in Dublin,
Ireland.
Yeah.

1287
01:17:35.460 --> 01:17:39.870
Martez legit possibility to get a win over a two time world champ.

1288
01:17:39.890 --> 01:17:44.890
World champion in the second boxing fight ever to boxing fights.

1289
01:17:45.531 --> 01:17:50.300
Ever two world champion [inaudible] Bank.
[inaudible] months on bowling.

1290
01:17:50.320 --> 01:17:52.970
How many say how much balls?
Stupid.

1291
01:17:52.971 --> 01:17:55.340
How much money do you think you would get for that fight though?

1292
01:17:55.400 --> 01:17:57.890
Not nearly as many more money than you'd get.

1293
01:17:57.891 --> 01:18:01.210
Fight Nate ATS with a tougher challenge.
Right?

1294
01:18:01.280 --> 01:18:05.030
So like what do you think the paper view would be for a polyman Naji fight?

1295
01:18:05.270 --> 01:18:08.600
What did even be a million bars?
For sure.
He thinks whatever con.
See,

1296
01:18:08.601 --> 01:18:09.111
that's the thing.

1297
01:18:09.111 --> 01:18:12.890
Connor Connor could play fucking in a slippery softball game right now.

1298
01:18:12.980 --> 01:18:14.750
A lot of people are going to buy that bitch.
You know what I'm saying?

1299
01:18:14.751 --> 01:18:17.720
So him fighting Pauli and there's all this heat.
People were like,
God,

1300
01:18:17.721 --> 01:18:20.300
he did well against Floyd.
We could see him being poly.

1301
01:18:20.610 --> 01:18:23.900
I would say at least a million.
And then if it's your own promotion,

1302
01:18:24.040 --> 01:18:28.010
what do you make?
30 right?
30 40 Mil,
right?
Hmm.

1303
01:18:28.790 --> 01:18:32.970
Interesting.
Interesting.
Bring your balls,
Connor,

1304
01:18:33.290 --> 01:18:37.950
please bring your boss.
Now Paul enlist.
Everyone knows that.
Like Polly when,

1305
01:18:37.951 --> 01:18:41.720
how Paul,
he's talking shit to all the UFC.
Well,

1306
01:18:41.721 --> 01:18:44.630
he should shut the fuck up because if you wanted to have a UFC fight,

1307
01:18:44.660 --> 01:18:47.090
he can go over there and get his brain kicked in.
Yeah.

1308
01:18:47.091 --> 01:18:51.290
You don't want them to stop talking.
You're a boxer.
You're very good boxer.

1309
01:18:51.380 --> 01:18:53.990
Just shut your mouth.
Just just go after.

1310
01:18:54.010 --> 01:18:58.040
There's literally a million people in the world that could grab you and strangle

1311
01:18:58.041 --> 01:19:01.190
the life out of you and there's not a goddamn thing you can do about it.
Correct.

1312
01:19:01.191 --> 01:19:04.230
Sorry Dude.
Like the UFC is not what you want to and you just don't get it.

1313
01:19:04.240 --> 01:19:05.930
Don't talk shit.
You will.

1314
01:19:05.990 --> 01:19:10.630
It will give you a wrestler and he will punch your fucking face into pulp.
Well,

1315
01:19:10.730 --> 01:19:13.930
he's not a goddamn thing you can do about it.
No,
not a goddamn thing.

1316
01:19:14.150 --> 01:19:18.120
Think he went towards Tony Ferguson alleyway was,

1317
01:19:18.700 --> 01:19:21.710
he's thick right now,
but what's his weight class like?

1318
01:19:21.711 --> 01:19:24.920
45 45 47 yeah.
How about you?

1319
01:19:24.980 --> 01:19:27.350
You give him Ricardo Lopez.

1320
01:19:30.050 --> 01:19:34.340
How about you give all your Rodriguez?
How about that?
I mean,
yeah.

1321
01:19:34.850 --> 01:19:38.580
You know what that,
yeah.
God.
Look at them.

1322
01:19:39.470 --> 01:19:42.770
Give him a guy that's not the top of the food.
Don't give him Frankie Edgar.

1323
01:19:42.771 --> 01:19:45.500
Don't give him Josie.
All Doe.
You don't need to do that.

1324
01:19:45.650 --> 01:19:50.270
You know who he could beat up though?
Oh,
cm punk.
He'd start Sam pond.
Probably.

1325
01:19:50.271 --> 01:19:52.230
Fuck.
See Him upper cut the fuck does.

1326
01:19:52.240 --> 01:19:57.110
Imagine what Max Holloway would do.
The polyman algae in an MMA fight.

1327
01:19:57.950 --> 01:19:58.783
Just imagine,

1328
01:19:59.400 --> 01:20:02.750
just trying to just try to wrap your head around with the kind of ass fucking,

1329
01:20:03.310 --> 01:20:06.410
I think.
I think Max when Adam on Twitter,

1330
01:20:06.411 --> 01:20:10.790
like they [inaudible] would literally kill him.
He,
if he wanted to monitor,

1331
01:20:10.791 --> 01:20:14.430
if you want to literally kill him,
I mean,
so would cub Swanson.

1332
01:20:14.460 --> 01:20:17.570
So with a lot of guys,
they just,
what they do in a boxing match,
again,

1333
01:20:17.590 --> 01:20:20.730
not so good.
Not so good.
Max has the best shot.

1334
01:20:21.060 --> 01:20:24.510
I think Max has amazing footwork and he's a good striker.
Very,
very good.

1335
01:20:24.511 --> 01:20:26.460
Striker is an excellent time and good discipline.

1336
01:20:26.610 --> 01:20:29.790
And his endurance is phenomenal.
Cody Garbrandt and might have something to say.

1337
01:20:30.030 --> 01:20:33.840
Even at 45 you'd come and fight Polly.
It'd be interesting.
Be Interesting.

1338
01:20:34.020 --> 01:20:34.720
But Manoj,

1339
01:20:34.720 --> 01:20:38.000
he's a legit world champion pro boxer and he's just fucking smart dude.

1340
01:20:38.840 --> 01:20:40.910
He's a very smart guy.
He's one of the best analysts in the game.

1341
01:20:40.911 --> 01:20:43.170
Like he probably doesn't need to do all this.
Yeah,

1342
01:20:43.171 --> 01:20:45.090
well that was one of the things that people were super concerned about.

1343
01:20:45.091 --> 01:20:46.080
Him sparring with Connor.

1344
01:20:46.081 --> 01:20:49.040
Like he did two 12 round sparring matches with Connor and Connor.

1345
01:20:49.410 --> 01:20:53.460
He did a eight round and 12 round one round two him and Connor was,
you know,

1346
01:20:53.461 --> 01:20:56.520
landing some,
obviously some fucking hard shots.
Just one.

1347
01:20:56.521 --> 01:21:00.270
What we know when we definitely saw that one straight left,

1348
01:21:00.271 --> 01:21:04.170
the fucking climbed them.
That was right dead center in the Mug.

1349
01:21:04.171 --> 01:21:06.540
And you see the sparks fly.
But also to Paulie's defense.

1350
01:21:06.541 --> 01:21:10.080
This was telling Paula like,
dude,
let's say I'm retired.

1351
01:21:10.170 --> 01:21:13.340
Let's say Cain Velasquez was a cake shop.
I need you to help me train me.

1352
01:21:13.620 --> 01:21:16.620
I need you to come help.
Give me some rounds.
That's not a free ride right there.

1353
01:21:16.650 --> 01:21:20.070
That punch.
Fuck no,
that's not a free ride.
That is nice face.
We can refer to it.

1354
01:21:20.100 --> 01:21:23.290
That is your face getting crushed.
But here's the thing,
if I,

1355
01:21:23.291 --> 01:21:26.550
if I got off the plane,
even from La to San Jose and Cain wants some rounds,

1356
01:21:26.551 --> 01:21:29.620
it king goes,
hey bro,
I need you to go five fives.
That ain't happening.

1357
01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.930
I'm here to help.
You Ain't know it.
DME,
five fives,

1358
01:21:33.270 --> 01:21:34.860
one round cell on the side and coaching.

1359
01:21:34.890 --> 01:21:36.300
There's a lot of ego shit going on there.

1360
01:21:36.360 --> 01:21:39.930
I think Conner's team brought Paulien to fuck him up.

1361
01:21:39.960 --> 01:21:43.680
That's the only reason to go.
If he does fuck him up were blasted out there.

1362
01:21:43.830 --> 01:21:45.210
Cause the cell,
the fight more.
Yeah.

1363
01:21:45.211 --> 01:21:49.200
And that was the other thing they said about that is like he Paulie's like you'd

1364
01:21:49.201 --> 01:21:51.870
never go 12 rounds like that.
He's like,

1365
01:21:51.871 --> 01:21:55.410
you never really heard of lying and go 12 rounds.
Even in MMA,

1366
01:21:55.411 --> 01:21:57.330
I've not heard of someone getting off the plane going five fives.

1367
01:21:57.360 --> 01:22:01.020
What basically gave him a practice fight.
That's it.
And it was,

1368
01:22:01.030 --> 01:22:03.930
it was smarter Commerce Park because confidence builder,

1369
01:22:03.990 --> 01:22:07.140
it also solidified him shit that mother fucker can unbox a little bit and then

1370
01:22:07.141 --> 01:22:10.380
Dana blasts it out.
You know,
I think it was good.
It was very smart.

1371
01:22:10.530 --> 01:22:14.400
Obviously I see it worked.
Obviously it worked.
Yeah.
Six and a half.

1372
01:22:14.430 --> 01:22:18.010
My mom pay per view buys shoes or balls.

1373
01:22:19.260 --> 01:22:22.440
You've created an animal so you've paid an animal.
If DFC the hammer,

1374
01:22:22.450 --> 01:22:26.190
the got to what else the fuck they have.
What else do they have?

1375
01:22:26.880 --> 01:22:31.380
Strew verse go,
Hello.
I want to see the full video.
I want to give.
He is full.

1376
01:22:31.381 --> 01:22:33.150
Do you can't see the full video.

1377
01:22:33.760 --> 01:22:36.110
You probably could get it and watch it but don't blast up until,

1378
01:22:36.490 --> 01:22:39.900
cause if you do that but then you don't have a fight in Dublin Todd.
Everybody.

1379
01:22:39.980 --> 01:22:41.640
Oh Man.
You know what I'm saying?
What?

1380
01:22:41.720 --> 01:22:46.620
It was like you can't cause let's say Connor starched him for 12 rounds.

1381
01:22:46.650 --> 01:22:47.880
Well then that fucks up the paper.

1382
01:22:47.881 --> 01:22:50.960
You buy it then we're like course he's going to beat him bullet.
If he didn't.

1383
01:22:51.140 --> 01:22:54.780
What if Paul is telling the truth?
Would if Paulista getting the most of them.

1384
01:22:54.930 --> 01:22:57.950
See that's why we want this debate.
So you buy the paper view.

1385
01:22:57.960 --> 01:23:00.930
If you're an ass kicking,
I'll give you a Tuesday.
That ass kicking.

1386
01:23:02.640 --> 01:23:05.320
You know what I'm saying?
Like,
you can't that tapes out there,

1387
01:23:05.321 --> 01:23:07.060
but you can't release it because going gonna fuck up the fight.

1388
01:23:07.180 --> 01:23:10.090
Maybe you see when the security guards were getting in his face,
it's like,

1389
01:23:10.091 --> 01:23:12.550
relax dude,
I'm a fighter.
Yeah.
He goes,
come on,
I'm a fighter.

1390
01:23:12.551 --> 01:23:15.490
They got kicked him out.
What the fuck you,
that's hilarious.
Yeah.

1391
01:23:15.520 --> 01:23:19.300
It's like I'm trying to hype up a fight.
Then palm scan of fight during the,
uh,

1392
01:23:19.330 --> 01:23:23.530
when we're doing a pre show,
because the fans were just fucking relentless.

1393
01:23:23.590 --> 01:23:28.510
The Irish fans were just harassing them and then the guy goes,
Paulie,

1394
01:23:28.750 --> 01:23:32.110
I'll kick your ass worse than Conor Mcgregor did.
And then finally Paul,
he goes,

1395
01:23:32.111 --> 01:23:36.490
fuck this,
take this things off.
Goes at them.
And so then,
uh,
Brian,
uh,

1396
01:23:36.491 --> 01:23:39.700
it gets between them,
Brian,
the comp Tia that with the shaved head.

1397
01:23:39.790 --> 01:23:42.670
And so he's like,
no,
no,
please don't do this.
And the guys I do,

1398
01:23:42.671 --> 01:23:45.930
so I'm might give you a worse beating him McGregor did in the,
you know,

1399
01:23:45.940 --> 01:23:48.680
his Irish accent,
poly can get,
don't buy your spot,

1400
01:23:50.080 --> 01:23:53.860
spit on him.
And then it was chaos.
Scary.

1401
01:23:54.310 --> 01:23:57.910
Scary for sure.
Again,
security earlier in that though,
I think about Pauline,

1402
01:23:57.970 --> 01:24:02.350
he's not scary looking.
So you feel like if there's a pro world champion boxer,

1403
01:24:02.351 --> 01:24:05.980
you talk shit to,
that might be the guy hat,
right?

1404
01:24:06.100 --> 01:24:09.280
Until you get fucking blasted in the face.
But you know what I mean?

1405
01:24:09.281 --> 01:24:11.590
Like there's certain people who is that guy?

1406
01:24:12.010 --> 01:24:16.030
That's Pauley and then that's his uh,
commerce manager.
Oh,

1407
01:24:16.270 --> 01:24:18.910
but there's like certain,
there's Connor said,
gentlemen,

1408
01:24:18.940 --> 01:24:22.550
we're businessman here and fucking business when,
hey,
this is the,

1409
01:24:22.630 --> 01:24:24.460
this is the shitty thing.
If you're Paul,
and this is,

1410
01:24:24.480 --> 01:24:28.660
this is the Internet Nazi Polly's bring the upon himself.
But if you met Paul,

1411
01:24:28.690 --> 01:24:33.010
he's a great fucking dude.
I like guy.
He's a great guy,
but he's just,

1412
01:24:33.280 --> 01:24:35.350
he's hanging himself.
Cause I told Paul,
I went,
Dude,

1413
01:24:35.650 --> 01:24:39.940
you're responding to these trolls and you're telling you it from MMAS world.

1414
01:24:39.941 --> 01:24:43.320
They fucking hate you,
man.
He fucked up when he wore the double diamond earrings.

1415
01:24:43.330 --> 01:24:45.730
Studs.
I'm not going to lie to you.
I disagree.
See,

1416
01:24:45.731 --> 01:24:50.560
I like the Double Diamond Jersey shoreline.
It's not,

1417
01:24:50.740 --> 01:24:54.700
it's not 2001.
You can't do that anymore.
Maybe where he's from.

1418
01:24:54.701 --> 01:24:59.290
He had fucking Brooklyn.
They just own that shit rocking from Bensonhurst,
right?

1419
01:24:59.380 --> 01:25:03.600
Mobile Nigee Hey,
they got to go straight or yeah,
but who's got the blues?

1420
01:25:03.630 --> 01:25:08.260
I am fucking,
what about the linguine?
Vom Go lay in MMA,
man.

1421
01:25:08.261 --> 01:25:11.620
They're just murdering.
Puts too much garlic in the sauce.

1422
01:25:13.840 --> 01:25:15.340
Yeah.
Paulie's be easy with the fuck.

1423
01:25:18.220 --> 01:25:23.200
Hey Dude,
look at this size.
It's true of walking around the cage.

1424
01:25:23.201 --> 01:25:26.580
It's like the cages up to his navel,
but also kids cage.

1425
01:25:26.610 --> 01:25:30.670
How the fuck did no one put a basketball in your hand?
Well,
do you hate money?

1426
01:25:30.730 --> 01:25:33.070
He's a Holland guy from Holland.

1427
01:25:33.100 --> 01:25:35.530
They don't even know what basketball is until they come over here to fucking

1428
01:25:35.531 --> 01:25:37.420
Google that shit.
It's nice.
It's true.

1429
01:25:37.450 --> 01:25:41.530
Taking you out of a Colorado making you play cricket.
Yeah.
I wish someone doing,

1430
01:25:41.680 --> 01:25:45.460
mate.
We need a quick,
it's star is seen as you're done.

1431
01:25:45.490 --> 01:25:47.050
Good breeding in Mexico.

1432
01:25:47.620 --> 01:25:50.830
Come on over and pay meeting your Mexico.

1433
01:25:51.520 --> 01:25:55.270
Everyone who plays cricket comes from a football background.

1434
01:25:56.230 --> 01:25:58.840
English,
football.
We don't hit each other.

1435
01:25:59.410 --> 01:26:03.100
Did he need someone who plays cricket?
Who's more physical?
He,

1436
01:26:03.140 --> 01:26:04.860
this homeboy doesn't get enough credit.
Timeout.

1437
01:26:04.950 --> 01:26:08.900
M One world champion [inaudible] world champion Jack.
He's a tough guy.

1438
01:26:09.080 --> 01:26:11.810
Ballot tour literally cannot hold a heavyweight champion.

1439
01:26:11.811 --> 01:26:14.330
Like when was the last time you even thought about the head look at him.

1440
01:26:14.340 --> 01:26:16.880
He bounced.
That's what I'm saying.
They can't hold them.

1441
01:26:16.940 --> 01:26:18.710
That's why I want Roy Nelson,

1442
01:26:18.711 --> 01:26:22.400
Bobby Lashley world title fight or they have to an Indian reservation.

1443
01:26:22.860 --> 01:26:25.580
I don't give a fuck what you do.
They have to do.
I want to buy,

1444
01:26:25.640 --> 01:26:27.740
but you know why no,
I get ya.
You know what I'm saying?

1445
01:26:28.760 --> 01:26:30.380
All natural and also all day.

1446
01:26:30.410 --> 01:26:32.470
Why not have fade or material and for a world title fight,

1447
01:26:32.471 --> 01:26:36.350
so at least there's a belt,
right?
Well fade or you know,

1448
01:26:36.470 --> 01:26:38.810
in Mitre on was a changing of the guard for sure.

1449
01:26:39.040 --> 01:26:43.040
Mitchell and knocking out fade or is basically okay.
This,
this ride's over.

1450
01:26:43.600 --> 01:26:45.910
It's essentially over.
If he wants to keep doing it,

1451
01:26:45.940 --> 01:26:49.580
he can get home until you know for sure.
But that's not American fence.

1452
01:26:49.581 --> 01:26:53.010
But like the people in the know that Mela Dano fight.
You're right.

1453
01:26:54.800 --> 01:26:57.950
Let's go over,
send me Schiltz old school.

1454
01:26:58.850 --> 01:27:00.890
So he's training with semi Shell.
That's a good sign.

1455
01:27:01.880 --> 01:27:05.390
He was trading southern Cali for awhile.
A man,
he's a monster.

1456
01:27:05.410 --> 01:27:10.040
Good tall 15 first round finishes.
Last fight.

1457
01:27:10.041 --> 01:27:13.670
He beat Roy Nelson.
Did he?
Yeah.
That's when Roy was like,
all right.
See you man.

1458
01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:18.200
Went to bell door.
That's what happened.
It was a decision.
Uh,

1459
01:27:18.230 --> 01:27:20.720
Roy who was a free,
yeah,
he be beat.
Really bad decision.

1460
01:27:20.990 --> 01:27:25.160
But then Royce contract was up and he went with belt.
Wow.

1461
01:27:25.520 --> 01:27:28.100
Can't blame him.
He's always had words with Dana.
You know,

1462
01:27:28.680 --> 01:27:30.500
everybody's always got back and forth.
Yeah.

1463
01:27:33.470 --> 01:27:37.220
I can't blame them.
It's good move for Roy.
It's a good move for a lot of guys.

1464
01:27:37.370 --> 01:27:42.370
You know what's a good fucking fight coming up is a Paul Daley is fighting a

1465
01:27:43.880 --> 01:27:48.500
Lorens Larkin.
That's a great fight.
It's a very good fight.
You know,

1466
01:27:48.800 --> 01:27:53.760
I mean daily had that real close fight with um,
the uh,

1467
01:27:53.960 --> 01:27:58.610
Beltour champ fucks is murked by Roy MacDonald daily.

1468
01:27:58.611 --> 01:28:02.480
Got Yes.
Dale taken down and then,
uh,
Lima,
Douglas Lema.
Oh,

1469
01:28:02.481 --> 01:28:05.070
you're talking about Larkin.
Yay.
Blocking had a real good fight with Lena.

1470
01:28:05.800 --> 01:28:09.050
Lucky and got hurt in that fight.
But yeah.
Yeah.
Um,

1471
01:28:09.470 --> 01:28:14.060
I feel like it's very possible that Roy Mcdonald's the best to wait on the

1472
01:28:14.061 --> 01:28:15.740
planet.
He is,
he beat Woodley.

1473
01:28:15.741 --> 01:28:19.870
Woodley is our champ and he looked so god damn technical part.

1474
01:28:19.920 --> 01:28:22.880
She what Roy said about,
uh,
Robbie Lawler?
No,

1475
01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:26.900
he was doing like a reddit Q and a or Facebook Q and a and then went,
hey,
um,

1476
01:28:26.930 --> 01:28:31.400
do you think uh,
Lawler was on steroids when you fought him?
And it wasn't like,

1477
01:28:31.430 --> 01:28:35.870
Eh,
maybe he was like,
I'm convinced to you us.
Whoa.
I know.

1478
01:28:36.550 --> 01:28:41.090
Goddamn.
Damn.
Why?
Why's he convinced?
I don't know.
You'd have to ask,

1479
01:28:41.750 --> 01:28:44.570
but Robbie's always been like that.
He's always been like super resilient.

1480
01:28:44.600 --> 01:28:47.750
Robbie Lawler for God sakes.
Yeah.
I have no idea for what it is.

1481
01:28:47.900 --> 01:28:50.420
He didn't look any different than he's ever looked right.

1482
01:28:50.720 --> 01:28:54.170
It always looks the same.
I don't know why you believe wagons cowboy.

1483
01:28:54.260 --> 01:28:58.340
I don't know what to believe.
All right.
I know right after that.
Who knows.

1484
01:28:59.030 --> 01:29:02.280
I was just like,
who knows where we're like,
gala kind of makes sense now.

1485
01:29:02.370 --> 01:29:07.050
I was putting all my Easter bunny chips in the Dick Pills basket,
not me.

1486
01:29:07.170 --> 01:29:11.240
I was like ended in half a maybe like a girl cheats on you.
Just forget about it.

1487
01:29:11.250 --> 01:29:15.580
Close my eyes and go to sleep and hope and to wake up and I know it's real.

1488
01:29:15.660 --> 01:29:18.630
I know they're all natural.
I know they're all natural.

1489
01:29:18.780 --> 01:29:21.300
He's just murking everybody.
Yeah.

1490
01:29:21.510 --> 01:29:24.450
Robby looked exactly the same when he fought cowboy and he fought the same way

1491
01:29:24.451 --> 01:29:28.800
too.
Like the third round was a rough round for cowboy.
He was coming on strong.

1492
01:29:29.340 --> 01:29:31.980
Robby was coming on strong.
Right.
We took the second round off.

1493
01:29:32.340 --> 01:29:35.060
He took the second one office and the third room was a rough round for cowboy.

1494
01:29:35.070 --> 01:29:39.730
Yeah.
Yeah.
Taking it to have them powered body shots.
Good fight though.
Very nice.

1495
01:29:39.870 --> 01:29:43.620
I love Calvin.
Calvin got robbed like,
Nah,
actually had Robbie winning that one.

1496
01:29:44.010 --> 01:29:48.240
One in three.
If it wasn't a draw,
I would think that you,

1497
01:29:48.390 --> 01:29:52.320
I like going towards the guy who's winning the fight and the last round to the

1498
01:29:52.321 --> 01:29:55.500
way pride used to do it.
Definitely won the first round.

1499
01:29:55.530 --> 01:29:57.000
Definitely when the third round I didn't,

1500
01:29:57.001 --> 01:29:59.040
I didn't have it as a draw and a segment.
It's not a 10,

1501
01:29:59.041 --> 01:30:02.290
eight and this is someone who's biased is fucked.
We're towel boy.
I was like,
God,

1502
01:30:02.340 --> 01:30:07.230
God dammit cowboy.
I agree.
Was that fight?
Um,
under the new rules?

1503
01:30:07.231 --> 01:30:10.050
It was,
right?
Sure was.
Yes.
Oh God.
Damn.

1504
01:30:10.051 --> 01:30:13.740
Everybody's gotta be on these Goddamn new rules.
How tall are these two?

1505
01:30:13.741 --> 01:30:17.400
This is the main event and write and we paid attention to three minutes of the

1506
01:30:17.401 --> 01:30:19.530
last fights.
Yeah.
A couple of Dad Bod,

1507
01:30:19.560 --> 01:30:23.130
the horrible triangle attempts by the checks and you kept calling them sweetie,

1508
01:30:25.320 --> 01:30:29.910
honey,
come on honey.
I'm like,
come on Sweetie Pie.
Come on.
Qt

1509
01:30:32.370 --> 01:30:36.740
couple tall boys here.
Super Tall.
You got it made.

1510
01:30:36.741 --> 01:30:38.820
You got a good point about that.
You don't have my car.

1511
01:30:39.510 --> 01:30:42.210
The international fuck go around.

1512
01:30:42.300 --> 01:30:45.930
EXOTICA treasons bump bump on it.

1513
01:30:47.070 --> 01:30:49.440
That guy's got a total Norman Rockwell haircut.

1514
01:30:49.640 --> 01:30:52.500
It could be in a soda shop somewhere.
Talking to a little kid with his dog.

1515
01:30:54.790 --> 01:30:58.290
God Damn stroop has on those giant basketball shorts.

1516
01:30:59.250 --> 01:31:01.440
Got True.
She wasn't finding a long time.

1517
01:31:01.470 --> 01:31:05.990
It's been a while where it's fucking hard.
Stop for a second.
Yeah.

1518
01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:09.630
He has like some serious problems,
right?
We have to have heart surgery man.

1519
01:31:09.640 --> 01:31:13.080
Then they thought he's done surgery.
Yeah,
they had to put something in his heart.

1520
01:31:13.450 --> 01:31:18.330
He's straight up heart surgery.
So yes.
Holy Shit.
I thought it was just like,

1521
01:31:18.331 --> 01:31:21.330
uh,
like uh,
some sort of an illness that,
you know,

1522
01:31:21.331 --> 01:31:24.060
and I feel like you'd have some sort of surgery scar.

1523
01:31:24.120 --> 01:31:26.880
I don't see it over his heart and my fake news,
Jamie,

1524
01:31:26.910 --> 01:31:30.360
sometimes they go into the armpit when they do certain surgeries for the heart.

1525
01:31:32.300 --> 01:31:36.220
They go in through your armpit and through the sidewall of your body.
Oh,
I,

1526
01:31:36.290 --> 01:31:38.970
they don't have to open your chest.
And I'd be writing cause he,

1527
01:31:38.971 --> 01:31:42.300
I know he had some serious shit going on cause we had the same manager at the

1528
01:31:42.301 --> 01:31:43.980
time.
Oh neat.

1529
01:31:44.340 --> 01:31:47.130
And everybody's supposed to fight Mitch reone that upkept might land one of

1530
01:31:47.131 --> 01:31:49.360
these times.
You know what's interesting is Volkov.

1531
01:31:49.380 --> 01:31:52.590
It's like one of the few guys that he's ever fought that's pretty close to him

1532
01:31:52.591 --> 01:31:55.020
and the reach department.
Travis Browne,
I'm gonna Trash Brown said,

1533
01:31:55.021 --> 01:31:59.680
oh you're tall.
Cool suit,
ran punch skyscraper.
That was amazing.
Amazing.

1534
01:31:59.681 --> 01:32:04.460
One of the best knockouts ever.
You might have a voided surgery.

1535
01:32:04.610 --> 01:32:06.770
Might've avoided it.
How did he do that?

1536
01:32:06.800 --> 01:32:09.680
Because you were in the you'll one lamb fight cause he had to do a get to do

1537
01:32:09.681 --> 01:32:12.740
something about it because you'll see was like so much of a risk.
Yeah.

1538
01:32:12.741 --> 01:32:16.730
He had some sneaky,
great day putting the rape choke on against the cage.

1539
01:32:17.120 --> 01:32:20.150
How many times a dude's run into those guys?
The cameras.

1540
01:32:20.270 --> 01:32:23.700
I've seen it happen once.
Had a lot,
but these guys are so tall as Cameron,

1541
01:32:23.720 --> 01:32:26.540
better to have their head on a swivel.
Also powerful.

1542
01:32:26.541 --> 01:32:30.320
Volkov has a sting ray tattoo on his back.
Like marijuana.

1543
01:32:30.380 --> 01:32:35.190
That's a marijuana tattoo.
Yeah,
you're welcome.
Oh Man.
What a great movies.

1544
01:32:35.210 --> 01:32:37.380
A good movie,
man.
Fuck the rock.
God came,

1545
01:32:37.440 --> 01:32:40.520
they I get more talented bad motherfucker.
Oh,

1546
01:32:40.521 --> 01:32:45.020
I can see struve on the ground.
Those trouble that motherfuckers guard is crazy.

1547
01:32:48.950 --> 01:32:49.783
<v 6>Hmm.</v>

1548
01:32:49.840 --> 01:32:54.700
<v 1>Modified workout regimen,
dietary changes and pressure medication.</v>

1549
01:32:54.940 --> 01:32:57.970
That's the word regimen.
That's one word that I really don't like.

1550
01:32:57.971 --> 01:33:02.230
Saying blood pressure medication.
Listen.
Nope.
Oh,

1551
01:33:02.231 --> 01:33:06.860
she's out of pillows talking about truck cracked on upper cuts landing dubber

1552
01:33:06.910 --> 01:33:11.740
cuts trouble.
Oh.
Um,

1553
01:33:11.800 --> 01:33:14.020
I'd be worried about Strube when the going gets rough in this fight,

1554
01:33:14.680 --> 01:33:19.080
he has to undergo another cardio vascular examination within six months in order

1555
01:33:19.081 --> 01:33:21.670
to maintain eligibility.
That's interesting.
It's true.

1556
01:33:21.671 --> 01:33:25.870
We'll have her be required to undergo an to Oh,
Gotcha.
Interesting.
Well you know,

1557
01:33:25.871 --> 01:33:27.280
people that are really that tall,

1558
01:33:27.281 --> 01:33:30.160
they a lot of times have problems with their heart.
Apparently.

1559
01:33:30.250 --> 01:33:31.930
It's just super difficult for your heart.

1560
01:33:31.960 --> 01:33:36.290
Great Dane got say to pump blood through all that tissue now named the tallest

1561
01:33:36.300 --> 01:33:39.730
Grandpa,
you know,
go.
They're all dead.
They're all dead.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1562
01:33:40.030 --> 01:33:40.930
It's a real bummer.

1563
01:33:41.290 --> 01:33:45.550
But there are some basketball players who've gone over this that are still

1564
01:33:45.551 --> 01:33:49.430
really tall.
Have we got over this?
Yeah.
Jamie and I have,
you know,

1565
01:33:49.550 --> 01:33:52.760
kids Posi you got to get to the bottom,

1566
01:33:55.420 --> 01:33:58.870
get excited about and get those texts.
Got.
But when you're older it's tough.

1567
01:33:58.871 --> 01:34:03.010
Like graphene.
She B 12 shots,
those dick pills.

1568
01:34:06.440 --> 01:34:09.050
Who's the oldest guy that gets laid on a regular basis?

1569
01:34:11.750 --> 01:34:15.120
Hugh Hefner still laying it down as he though to those young Izzy.
I know.

1570
01:34:15.130 --> 01:34:18.340
Take pictures of the smoking jacket on and taking naps.
Well first.
Yeah.

1571
01:34:18.360 --> 01:34:20.910
All right.
That uppercuts landing,
man.

1572
01:34:20.920 --> 01:34:24.590
I'll tell you how the fuck has up not tell all book come out about him.
Just,

1573
01:34:25.010 --> 01:34:25.341
you know,

1574
01:34:25.341 --> 01:34:29.150
just having limp dick all the time and all these three hot chicks and just the

1575
01:34:29.151 --> 01:34:31.970
shit he goes through to get it up and like come on half.

1576
01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000
He's got an oil drum filled.
If I aggravate,

1577
01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:39.560
he's taking fucking shoot him down like peanut m and m's is that wilt

1578
01:34:39.561 --> 01:34:43.810
Chamberlain but he's dead
for awhile.
Uh,

1579
01:34:44.060 --> 01:34:48.960
he didn't live that long,
man.
That's not that long.
That old?
Nah,
take game.

1580
01:34:48.961 --> 01:34:53.070
Still strong at 63 63 he died.
Yeah.
Whoa.

1581
01:34:53.120 --> 01:34:57.080
How old a Hugh Hefner and he's,
he's,
he's,
that's his thing.
Dick and girls.

1582
01:34:57.350 --> 01:34:59.750
But I feel like it's all a lie.
Like they're all like,
yeah,
just taking a nap.

1583
01:34:59.751 --> 01:35:03.530
We'll chill here and while we make noises just pays.
Well,

1584
01:35:03.650 --> 01:35:06.440
Graham crackers and shit.
Yeah,
his grandpa Liz bed.

1585
01:35:06.620 --> 01:35:08.250
Can't believe it's going down in that room.

1586
01:35:11.270 --> 01:35:15.620
He's snoring and farting.
Meanwhile,
just a soundtrack.
Kimchi farts.

1587
01:35:16.700 --> 01:35:20.510
Farts.
Smell like tobacco pipe.
Sleep.
Fuck.
Oh fuck.

1588
01:35:20.530 --> 01:35:23.450
Coughs on top here.
Dropping them hammers.
Yeah.

1589
01:35:23.451 --> 01:35:26.430
He's not fucking anyone who might be.
Yeah.

1590
01:35:26.470 --> 01:35:29.720
It could just be like the ultimate ladies.
Man.
What is the oldest living?

1591
01:35:29.750 --> 01:35:33.680
A basketball player.
A pro basketball player.
It wasn't Bill Russell.
Fairly old.

1592
01:35:35.150 --> 01:35:39.350
How old is he?
I saw Clyde Drexler and Vegas duty alone.

1593
01:35:39.351 --> 01:35:42.800
Hammering him 83 bill Russell's 83 that's amazing.

1594
01:35:43.370 --> 01:35:48.140
And he's a tall dude,
right?
Isn't even fuck.
He's like six something.

1595
01:35:48.141 --> 01:35:52.910
Six 10 or something.
That's amazing that he's that healthy at that age.

1596
01:35:53.350 --> 01:35:58.190
Eight six ten six 10 10 Jesus.
That's like crazy.
He's fucked up.
Wow.

1597
01:35:58.390 --> 01:36:03.250
They're both fucked up though.
Yeah.
Big Car.
Big.
No,

1598
01:36:03.251 --> 01:36:06.180
it was really interesting.
Race.
Ooh,
got super interesting race.

1599
01:36:06.181 --> 01:36:09.710
I'm not mad at that too.
I celebrate sting ray myself.
Wonder why?

1600
01:36:09.890 --> 01:36:13.440
Because he's a stinger.
Yeah.
Look at Bill Russell 83 titles.

1601
01:36:13.790 --> 01:36:15.740
I can just tell by looking at him.
He's not take anyone down.

1602
01:36:16.370 --> 01:36:21.200
You know it's not the shoulders posture.
Yeah,
exactly.
It looks sad.
Wow.

1603
01:36:21.201 --> 01:36:25.980
Struve Katyn off here.
What's the upper cut?
Boom.
There it is.

1604
01:36:26.170 --> 01:36:30.260
It keeps sneaking over that left arm,
dude.

1605
01:36:30.261 --> 01:36:33.140
That knees and what condom that Greg glancing knee.

1606
01:36:34.360 --> 01:36:35.860
You don't want to be it against truth.

1607
01:36:39.230 --> 01:36:41.660
He was like married to a dime piece still though.
He finally,

1608
01:36:41.661 --> 01:36:44.550
he finally settled down,
lift up and he also sold the mansion.

1609
01:36:44.560 --> 01:36:47.620
You know that be like still lives in like the backhouse something.

1610
01:36:47.710 --> 01:36:51.130
Well he had some weird deal like you're trying to sell the mansion for like 200

1611
01:36:51.130 --> 01:36:53.830
million bucks,
but he had to live there.
That was like part of the deal.

1612
01:36:53.890 --> 01:36:56.320
I don't know if he actually sold it.
I think he did.

1613
01:36:56.321 --> 01:36:59.780
Someone Bob's a cake can chill in the back.
Backpage.
This is weird.
I'm going to,

1614
01:36:59.840 --> 01:37:00.760
I'm buying.
I'm like,
yeah,

1615
01:37:00.761 --> 01:37:02.800
I'll do that and as soon as we can to get your old ass out.

1616
01:37:02.830 --> 01:37:05.800
Well you got to realize like how much time does he have left?
Like,

1617
01:37:05.801 --> 01:37:08.890
how much can they live?
10 years.
How old is he?

1618
01:37:09.360 --> 01:37:13.120
Hugh turned 90 last year.
He's solid.

1619
01:37:13.121 --> 01:37:17.920
Five years left is 29 29 let me see.
First of all,

1620
01:37:17.921 --> 01:37:22.680
he's 90 she's two she's 29 yeah.
Well she's 30 this year.
Congratulations.

1621
01:37:23.160 --> 01:37:28.150
Good for you girl.
You won the lotto.
You bad person.
You're a whore.

1622
01:37:29.440 --> 01:37:32.170
She's fine,
dude.
Yeah,
I'm not mad at her.
Yeah,
my bad.
Leave her alone.
No,

1623
01:37:32.171 --> 01:37:35.890
not matter girl.
Good God.
Those are totally real tests too by the way.

1624
01:37:36.660 --> 01:37:40.930
My go.
Gorgeous body.
You have out kicked your coverage.

1625
01:37:40.990 --> 01:37:44.550
Old Man.
Without a doubt.
She is.
What'd you bring up the best picture of all time.

1626
01:37:44.990 --> 01:37:49.960
You get a full bar?
No,
she's hot dude.
She she smokes.
Well man,

1627
01:37:50.650 --> 01:37:55.000
the one you brought up was great.
Okay,
so we can go belong in the,

1628
01:37:55.350 --> 01:37:59.160
they're long in the face.
How dare you?
She's 30 years old.

1629
01:37:59.760 --> 01:38:04.590
You son of a dude.
She's hot there though.
You are a mean person.
A pretty there.

1630
01:38:04.680 --> 01:38:07.410
Ooh He did for you here.
She's more than hot enough.

1631
01:38:07.580 --> 01:38:08.940
I wonder if they have like an arrangement,

1632
01:38:09.720 --> 01:38:13.680
meaning like of her trainer comes over and just runs trains on her

1633
01:38:16.530 --> 01:38:20.430
with his fucking apprentice.
I've got a couple of friends coming over.
Hey,

1634
01:38:20.431 --> 01:38:25.080
we're gonna,
we're gonna do a little workout relationship.
Yeah,

1635
01:38:25.081 --> 01:38:28.060
I think you got to you t there's no way.
If,

1636
01:38:28.090 --> 01:38:32.190
if his heart is a normal heart,
he can fuck more than once a month.

1637
01:38:32.460 --> 01:38:35.970
You're talking about Hugh Hefner.
You're talking about Hugh half,
not the legend.

1638
01:38:36.390 --> 01:38:41.190
This is what he does,
bro.
Oh Shit.
I poke,
come on.
Dammit.

1639
01:38:41.260 --> 01:38:44.880
This
look at his old basic lives.

1640
01:38:45.720 --> 01:38:49.650
Those were the basic dates.
Free got fucking rich.
And how many people had,

1641
01:38:51.050 --> 01:38:53.940
he had one of them.
It was flying a plane when he met her.
Look,

1642
01:38:55.640 --> 01:38:59.280
she was fucking,
that's a captain's hat.
The fuck is he doing?

1643
01:38:59.281 --> 01:39:02.710
It's tilted to the side and from World War One and shit.
That's what he's doing.

1644
01:39:02.740 --> 01:39:05.670
He was like getting 49 he was ahead of the game when it comes to tilting your

1645
01:39:05.671 --> 01:39:09.330
hat sideways.
Oh yeah,
that's a poker right?

1646
01:39:09.670 --> 01:39:12.080
A hundred percent dude.
How bout uh,

1647
01:39:12.700 --> 01:39:17.700
cause we remember the yet the TV show we had the three girls I've slept with

1648
01:39:18.330 --> 01:39:22.110
over a thousand women.
Yes.
Have,

1649
01:39:22.950 --> 01:39:26.490
I mean who's that one?
Oh,
to say,

1650
01:39:26.491 --> 01:39:30.030
tell all got she's sucking.
Yeah,
but here's the thing.

1651
01:39:30.300 --> 01:39:34.710
No one's reading those books.
You're right.
You know what?
When you're right,

1652
01:39:34.711 --> 01:39:36.580
you're right.
The fuck out of here.

1653
01:39:36.581 --> 01:39:40.320
When he looks like he looks like a mannequin there.
He looks like shit though.

1654
01:39:40.380 --> 01:39:42.650
He's been throwing Dick for a,

1655
01:39:44.640 --> 01:39:49.640
but he's also probably had some super boring conversations with these checks for

1656
01:39:50.131 --> 01:39:53.220
a long was that Steve talked to 23 year old.

1657
01:39:53.520 --> 01:39:57.360
You want to ram your head in the Goddamn ground after meanwhile he's marrying

1658
01:39:57.361 --> 01:40:01.260
these checks.
He's paying a price,
bro.
He is.

1659
01:40:01.410 --> 01:40:05.770
I think it's like part of like what's valuable for his brain's a well read guy.

1660
01:40:06.360 --> 01:40:10.260
You know,
like he's not,
oh,
there's that uptight.
He's not a moron.
Yeah.

1661
01:40:10.740 --> 01:40:15.300
This is a fucking good fight,
man.
Great fight.
Five rounds.
Jesus Christ.

1662
01:40:15.510 --> 01:40:17.700
They're super bloody.
Yeah.

1663
01:40:19.500 --> 01:40:23.160
This is the second
or the third.

1664
01:40:24.330 --> 01:40:28.770
This is the third boy.
That cheekbones fucked up on Volkov.

1665
01:40:29.470 --> 01:40:34.320
He got his last divorce cause his wife was unfaithful.
Son of a bitch.
Oh,

1666
01:40:34.410 --> 01:40:39.410
how dare you filed for divorce and says his wife was the unfaithful one.

1667
01:40:39.970 --> 01:40:44.410
C those are you bitches.
I was talking about the ones from the playhouse.

1668
01:40:44.550 --> 01:40:46.680
One Ms. Oh shit.

1669
01:40:46.681 --> 01:40:50.040
He's landing on him early in the relationship.
God,

1670
01:40:50.041 --> 01:40:53.000
how are you going to cheat on Hugh?
You send them a patch air sheet.

1671
01:40:53.620 --> 01:40:56.650
This is my thing though.
Let's say,
could you,
could you,

1672
01:40:57.810 --> 01:40:59.230
when I was a single man,

1673
01:40:59.290 --> 01:41:02.890
I dated a girl who was friends with Hugh.

1674
01:41:02.980 --> 01:41:05.620
Could you marry a girl who dated Hugh Hefner?

1675
01:41:06.910 --> 01:41:10.990
It's kind of a red flag.
Yeah,
it seems like it'd be an issue,
right?
Yeah.

1676
01:41:11.050 --> 01:41:14.350
It would come up if she ever talked any crazy shit,

1677
01:41:14.680 --> 01:41:19.130
he'd be like [inaudible] what would you say?
Yeah,

1678
01:41:19.200 --> 01:41:22.870
it'd be days at a hundred year old man.
And why did she do that?

1679
01:41:23.260 --> 01:41:26.830
To be that magazine in 2016 are you shitting me?

1680
01:41:27.190 --> 01:41:29.080
No one reads magazines either.
You're dumb bitch.

1681
01:41:29.140 --> 01:41:32.740
Maybe she did it for the experience.
Yeah.
Maybe just didn't like,
you know,

1682
01:41:32.920 --> 01:41:37.330
one of those bucket list things.
Maybe just has a strong take game to jelly.

1683
01:41:37.331 --> 01:41:40.000
Forget about that.
Right to Hefner for a retro,
right.

1684
01:41:41.380 --> 01:41:43.870
Maybe a big Ole summer sausage for a deck.
Yeah,

1685
01:41:44.020 --> 01:41:49.020
a giant didn't you got to think that if you're a guy like you have nerd like all

1686
01:41:49.960 --> 01:41:54.320
these years of doing this,
all these years of banging chicks.
All right.

1687
01:41:54.810 --> 01:41:58.300
It's got to get boring after awhile.
Super born.
So you start fucking dude's

1688
01:41:59.980 --> 01:42:04.420
like,
what do you do after awhile?
When did Hugh Hefner?
Um,
I don't know.

1689
01:42:04.700 --> 01:42:08.230
I think he like plays backgammon or something.
He has a bunch of kids though.

1690
01:42:08.470 --> 01:42:10.060
Yeah,
it could of gang kids.

1691
01:42:11.440 --> 01:42:15.700
The magazine tried to have a no naked girls in it.
How for about a year.

1692
01:42:15.730 --> 01:42:17.740
How dare you?
Oh yeah.

1693
01:42:17.741 --> 01:42:20.770
Let me get my fucking playboy subscription because I want to know about the

1694
01:42:20.771 --> 01:42:24.700
politics one.
Are you guys doing for important to read articles?
Brendan?

1695
01:42:25.340 --> 01:42:28.900
Oh,
this is a good fucking fight,
man.
Good.

1696
01:42:28.901 --> 01:42:32.320
How's the leg kicks night full carb with some solid technique.

1697
01:42:35.680 --> 01:42:38.800
Well put.
So struve Oh nice.
Neither.
Bonnie

1698
01:42:41.160 --> 01:42:45.600
struve is not a spring chicken,
but he's been around for a long time.

1699
01:42:45.620 --> 01:42:48.330
He's been fine for a long time.
I'm thinking about that.

1700
01:42:48.331 --> 01:42:52.350
Travis Browne basically out of the picture now.
Roy kind of,

1701
01:42:53.920 --> 01:42:58.860
um,
think about,
he fought Pat Barry.
He fought a chip.
Everybody.

1702
01:42:59.310 --> 01:43:02.880
Yeah,
he's been around for a long fucking time.
So it was Travis Browne done.

1703
01:43:03.810 --> 01:43:08.760
I don't know.
He's what?
He's lost five of last six or six other,
said no shit.

1704
01:43:08.850 --> 01:43:09.630
You know.
Uh,

1705
01:43:09.630 --> 01:43:13.380
Josh Barnett was super impressed with them in preparation for this last fight.

1706
01:43:13.530 --> 01:43:16.410
That Russian dude put the squeeze on them then it doesn't matter though,

1707
01:43:16.411 --> 01:43:18.600
because when you lose five out of six,
you know,
like,

1708
01:43:19.050 --> 01:43:21.030
we don't care what you're doing.
Training.
He didn't look,

1709
01:43:21.090 --> 01:43:23.390
I mean he looked good in the beginning,
in the beginning of looked good.

1710
01:43:23.450 --> 01:43:25.850
It's moving around,
but he didn't look like,
you know,

1711
01:43:25.860 --> 01:43:27.570
he doesn't look like vintage Travis Brown.

1712
01:43:27.571 --> 01:43:29.550
I feel like he needs to go back to Albuquerque,

1713
01:43:30.620 --> 01:43:33.830
but maybe you just didn't want to do anymore.
That's positive.
The other thing.

1714
01:43:34.460 --> 01:43:37.290
Rhonda got married.
Maybe just,
yeah,
maybe it's just time to move on,

1715
01:43:37.291 --> 01:43:39.460
which isn't a bad thing.
Like No.
Sometimes we were,

1716
01:43:39.470 --> 01:43:40.830
wants these guys to keep fighting,

1717
01:43:40.831 --> 01:43:43.980
but maybe there's more form out there that he's a good guy too.

1718
01:43:43.981 --> 01:43:44.814
That's the other thing.

1719
01:43:44.910 --> 01:43:49.200
The bad thing is when you don't move on and you keep fighting and you don't want

1720
01:43:49.201 --> 01:43:52.380
to preach.
Who needed a body?
Wolkoff

1721
01:43:52.430 --> 01:43:56.120
<v 0>turning on
lazy side.
Tick.</v>

1722
01:43:56.900 --> 01:44:01.430
I gotta Piss so hard to it.
Let it go.
Let it go.

1723
01:44:04.240 --> 01:44:08.020
This podcast has been brought to you by life and his gentlemen,

1724
01:44:08.620 --> 01:44:13.090
the smooth,
sweet,
relaxing experiences of life.

1725
01:44:13.640 --> 01:44:18.640
It's a good fight so far,
Jamie and join us.
Yes.
These two.
These are huge.

1726
01:44:18.760 --> 01:44:20.530
Yeah,
they're giant Stephan's troops,

1727
01:44:20.570 --> 01:44:24.220
seven feet tall and this guy is like not quite as tall as him,

1728
01:44:24.221 --> 01:44:28.390
but he's in the neighborhood.
I think Volkov is probably about six,
eight.

1729
01:44:28.810 --> 01:44:33.460
How tall is he?
I'm guessing six.
Eight is four inches shorter,
so,
so yeah,

1730
01:44:33.670 --> 01:44:37.240
I think struve is just seven feet,
so pretty close.

1731
01:44:38.340 --> 01:44:42.850
It's an interesting situation the heavyweight division has because you

1732
01:44:42.851 --> 01:44:46.450
essentially have Alistair Overeem who's really looks like the only credible

1733
01:44:46.451 --> 01:44:48.900
challenge other than Francis and Ghana.

1734
01:44:48.940 --> 01:44:52.720
Francis and gone on and he's like a big win over somebody and he would have

1735
01:44:52.721 --> 01:44:57.100
gotten it if he had beaten junior dos Santos.
That would have been as big.
Yeah,

1736
01:44:57.101 --> 01:44:57.934
it's big cut.

1737
01:44:58.630 --> 01:45:02.620
Frances would've gotten the possibility or the opportunity rather to get a big

1738
01:45:02.621 --> 01:45:06.550
win over real big name with junior,
but junior pissed hot.

1739
01:45:07.600 --> 01:45:10.810
So now Francis has to wait for another opponent,

1740
01:45:10.811 --> 01:45:13.720
but he's the most exciting challenge her.

1741
01:45:13.930 --> 01:45:16.300
But you still have Allister.

1742
01:45:17.270 --> 01:45:19.150
I think Derrick Lewis is coming back.

1743
01:45:21.400 --> 01:45:25.900
Who just beat Derrick Lewis.
So many beat Derek close.

1744
01:45:27.040 --> 01:45:31.860
Oh,
Mark Hunt kind of beat his ass.
Wasn't,

1745
01:45:31.890 --> 01:45:35.340
wasn't the best fight for Derek.
And then he quit.

1746
01:45:35.400 --> 01:45:38.310
He retired after is over and it changes.
Mind

1747
01:45:39.930 --> 01:45:44.930
point is there's only like legitimately like four or five real contenders that

1748
01:45:46.081 --> 01:45:49.860
are exciting in the whole heavyweight division,
which is just crazy.
Oh my God.

1749
01:45:49.861 --> 01:45:53.610
He poked him again.
October.
Stephan's true.

1750
01:45:53.611 --> 01:45:58.530
Just poked Volkov again.
God dammit.
They're too tall.
Too Tall to be fighting.

1751
01:45:58.780 --> 01:46:01.320
Mark Goddard going to straighten it out.
There's some,

1752
01:46:01.350 --> 01:46:04.440
there's some downsides being too tall.
Like you look like shit and close.

1753
01:46:04.441 --> 01:46:07.200
No snow shoes.
Like cool.
You know,

1754
01:46:07.201 --> 01:46:11.460
like there's just too big no scuba gear.
Everyone's rent shit.

1755
01:46:11.940 --> 01:46:14.220
Everything about that car.

1756
01:46:14.221 --> 01:46:18.780
You can get GD three not up in air.
You wouldn't fit.
Yeah.

1757
01:46:18.781 --> 01:46:22.510
Like that was the thing was shack.
He would buy cars and cut out the back seat.

1758
01:46:23.310 --> 01:46:26.910
Put socks,
man.
Cheyenne ass seat.
And there's only certain cars you can have.

1759
01:46:29.970 --> 01:46:33.360
You think they'll ever be a super heavyweight division?
Never.

1760
01:46:33.450 --> 01:46:34.850
There's not enough heavyweights.

1761
01:46:35.610 --> 01:46:37.890
It seems to me that they shouldn't have a weight class.

1762
01:46:38.010 --> 01:46:39.960
It's just like the heavyweight division in boxing.

1763
01:46:40.500 --> 01:46:45.030
Like when David Haye fought value of,
I think value of is 300 pounds.

1764
01:46:45.210 --> 01:46:49.200
Yeah.
So you're saying there's just two oh six and above to the limit to 25

1765
01:46:50.110 --> 01:46:50.311
<v 1>yeah,</v>

1766
01:46:50.311 --> 01:46:55.311
like two 25 I think there should be a two Oh five to 25 and then have added

1767
01:46:56.400 --> 01:47:01.310
fuckers.
Yeah,
to 25 on up.
I wonder why they don't do that.

1768
01:47:01.311 --> 01:47:04.560
But there's also you're gonna get some slop like usually,
typically,

1769
01:47:04.740 --> 01:47:08.370
especially with the golden stitch around these days,
if you're over to 80,

1770
01:47:08.580 --> 01:47:12.560
you getting sloppy up and then it's bad for the product.
The mound.

1771
01:47:14.170 --> 01:47:19.020
Okay.
Pit Pass him any test including him at this.
He's doing nothing.

1772
01:47:19.860 --> 01:47:23.640
Nothing.
My past immigration,
fuck be tough man.

1773
01:47:25.110 --> 01:47:28.020
I bet he could like some like um,

1774
01:47:28.950 --> 01:47:33.540
what are those stones called?
Well,
it's big fucking stones.

1775
01:47:33.600 --> 01:47:37.040
Atlas stones.
He would probably pass an atlas stone certification test.

1776
01:47:37.050 --> 01:47:37.883
That's about it.

1777
01:47:41.840 --> 01:47:44.940
It's just bad for the look.
The size of that dude picking up rocks and shit.

1778
01:47:45.060 --> 01:47:47.370
If he hears this and I run into him,
it's going to be trouble.

1779
01:47:49.170 --> 01:47:53.150
I think you'd be okay.
He's fun.
He's much calmer.

1780
01:47:54.720 --> 01:47:58.070
He did.
You saw that.
Did he,

1781
01:47:58.380 --> 01:48:00.360
how did he die and came with Thrones?

1782
01:48:00.570 --> 01:48:03.300
He gets stabbed with a spear and then they brought him back to life with

1783
01:48:03.301 --> 01:48:06.090
witchcraft
bro.

1784
01:48:06.150 --> 01:48:09.990
I didn't know right now they're trying to bring back life.
I don't know.

1785
01:48:09.991 --> 01:48:11.700
They found it and date it for God sakes.

1786
01:48:11.940 --> 01:48:15.450
Last time I saw him as he crushed that guys who was two years ago,
Bro.

1787
01:48:16.140 --> 01:48:20.250
But you know where I'm at.
My Dad.
I thought you already passed it.
Nah Man.

1788
01:48:20.280 --> 01:48:24.390
Well trust me,
it's worth watching.
I Bet I'm a fan.
I'm a fan.

1789
01:48:24.510 --> 01:48:28.920
I assume they were bringing them back though.
It stopped.

1790
01:48:28.930 --> 01:48:30.070
Avoid spoilers and shit.

1791
01:48:33.360 --> 01:48:38.340
These guys are rock 'em sock 'em robot in this bitch.
Struble it's more tired.

1792
01:48:42.480 --> 01:48:47.040
Good thing is that big cardio.
Cardio is just such a giant factor in fights.
Dude.

1793
01:48:47.041 --> 01:48:51.810
In heavyweight it every,
every division,
every really heavyweight.
Yeah,
yeah,
sure.

1794
01:48:51.840 --> 01:48:56.280
Oh that's,
there you go.
That's it.
When skyscraper falls down,
there you go.

1795
01:48:57.870 --> 01:49:00.690
That's it.
What,
how many more times we see strew fight?

1796
01:49:01.230 --> 01:49:04.890
How many more times is going to get KOD?
How many times has it been caseload?

1797
01:49:05.810 --> 01:49:10.630
Start flatline.
Dim Travis Browne,
k Odom.
This dude,
just k Odom.

1798
01:49:10.650 --> 01:49:12.250
Roy Kale,
raw k owed him.

1799
01:49:13.780 --> 01:49:16.800
I feel like it looks worse cause he's so God damn tall.
You know what I'm saying?

1800
01:49:16.980 --> 01:49:20.400
Like have a burger king burns down.
We don't want you.
If a skyscraper burns down,

1801
01:49:20.460 --> 01:49:23.520
we watch it.
It's a good point.
You know what I'm saying?
That's a good point.

1802
01:49:23.760 --> 01:49:27.780
He CalEd Steepbank inside like kick then boom.
Yeah,

1803
01:49:27.781 --> 01:49:30.900
he knocked out Steve Bay.
It's also heavyweights like that's what you do.

1804
01:49:30.901 --> 01:49:35.310
You get like people get knocked out,
man.
Yup.
This is true.

1805
01:49:35.670 --> 01:49:36.503
This is true.

1806
01:49:38.430 --> 01:49:39.263
<v 5>Okay.</v>

1807
01:49:39.380 --> 01:49:43.910
<v 1>How many people watch us?
You think?
Boom.
That upper cut?
Yeah.</v>

1808
01:49:43.911 --> 01:49:47.680
I was sober worldwide.
How many people watched us?
Nah Man,

1809
01:49:47.710 --> 01:49:50.140
you was this on fight pass.
Just fight path.

1810
01:49:51.400 --> 01:49:52.870
How many people are on fight pass

1811
01:49:56.220 --> 01:50:00.250
the subscriptions?
Is it around 200,000 I have no idea of that.

1812
01:50:00.251 --> 01:50:02.770
It's more than that.
I ain't saying,
I don't know.

1813
01:50:02.950 --> 01:50:07.060
So is the only way this is playing on five pounds for it,
right?
In Rotterdam

1814
01:50:08.770 --> 01:50:12.040
it's like on Fox sports on Schneider over there or something.

1815
01:50:12.280 --> 01:50:15.020
It's like that's a great mood.
Okay.
Bruce,

1816
01:50:15.540 --> 01:50:19.960
look at Bruce Buffer about Bruce looks exhausted a fire up here we go.
Go.

1817
01:50:20.700 --> 01:50:21.533
<v 7>Okay</v>

1818
01:50:22.180 --> 01:50:25.870
<v 1>God.
Bruce goes everywhere he is.
Listen,
if you're,</v>

1819
01:50:26.050 --> 01:50:29.580
if you want to keep that job like that's what you do.
You have to go everywhere.

1820
01:50:29.590 --> 01:50:34.090
Yeah.
They use that Joe Martinez though too,
because he speaks Spanish.
Yeah.

1821
01:50:34.150 --> 01:50:37.290
Blake's good if Bruce one.
Yeah,
he's really good.
I don't want Joe for over it.

1822
01:50:37.291 --> 01:50:40.630
But if Bruce and he was in WC,
but if Bruce wants to take a break,

1823
01:50:40.631 --> 01:50:43.780
he can like you don't have to fly to Rotterdam for one night.
You know,

1824
01:50:43.781 --> 01:50:46.720
it's one of the reasons why I didn't want to get his knee operated on because

1825
01:50:46.721 --> 01:50:50.170
they don't want to take some time off.
It's got a blown ACL.

1826
01:50:50.650 --> 01:50:55.600
Did you see the video in ball at ACL out?
It's classic sad.

1827
01:50:55.630 --> 01:50:59.770
He's doing like a fucking karaoke thing and fell at the uh,

1828
01:50:59.800 --> 01:51:03.950
in Las Vegas.
Man.

1829
01:51:03.951 --> 01:51:08.330
Who the fuck they took Francis off the car,
didn't they?
Yeah.
Breaking my heart.

1830
01:51:08.840 --> 01:51:11.690
Well the junior dos Santos things breaks my heart too because it was just a

1831
01:51:11.691 --> 01:51:13.610
diuretic.
Like I don't get it.

1832
01:51:13.611 --> 01:51:17.870
They found a trace amount of a diuretic in a system like that is not helping
him.

1833
01:51:18.170 --> 01:51:20.870
There's not going to help him fight.
You know what I mean?

1834
01:51:20.871 --> 01:51:23.330
It's just not the only thing that could be,

1835
01:51:23.540 --> 01:51:27.120
cause you could say that a diuretic might be used to mask steroids.
True.

1836
01:51:27.740 --> 01:51:30.760
I think they do do that.
Correct.
Right.
So there,

1837
01:51:30.770 --> 01:51:33.170
there's potentially he was mass something,
which I don't think so,

1838
01:51:33.171 --> 01:51:37.480
but also no one else wants to step up the plate and fight Francis [inaudible]

1839
01:51:37.520 --> 01:51:39.320
who wants to that guy's terrifying.

1840
01:51:40.280 --> 01:51:44.280
Fuck all that short notice.
You.
What else?
Elster over here.

1841
01:51:44.300 --> 01:51:48.210
It was like no elsewhere.
Like mm.
Good.
Alistair Overeem turned it down.
Alice,

1842
01:51:48.211 --> 01:51:52.300
just write about the fight for the title.
Who else is there?
Yup.
Yup.

1843
01:51:52.340 --> 01:51:55.880
For doom verse Derrick Lewis.
Now Dick Lewis,
same p one.
Houston.

1844
01:51:55.881 --> 01:52:00.520
Shout out Derrick Lewis.
Yeah,
that a person saving people with his truck.
Um,

1845
01:52:00.870 --> 01:52:05.750
the people that got down truck.
Who else?
I mean a d when Derek fights for doom,

1846
01:52:05.990 --> 01:52:08.510
if for doom wins,
he's got a real good,

1847
01:52:09.620 --> 01:52:11.870
real good argument for him being the next in line.

1848
01:52:12.410 --> 01:52:17.210
But if he doesn't or if it's not a good fight or if anything goes sideways,

1849
01:52:17.690 --> 01:52:20.450
you got Allister.
That's it.
Who else is there?

1850
01:52:20.510 --> 01:52:23.600
Francis Francis hasn't have a big name or a big person yet.

1851
01:52:23.930 --> 01:52:26.630
If Francis beat junior dos Santos,
do you got a big name?

1852
01:52:26.730 --> 01:52:28.550
We're going through his like,
yeah,
but

1853
01:52:30.260 --> 01:52:32.270
I feel that heavy weight division so rough.

1854
01:52:32.330 --> 01:52:36.050
The potential Francis has is absolutely world champion potential a hundred

1855
01:52:36.050 --> 01:52:38.390
percent but it's just like,
do you make the fight right now?

1856
01:52:39.050 --> 01:52:42.110
Who else does he fight?
The jds was the Mark Hunt.

1857
01:52:43.350 --> 01:52:47.780
Frances Khan's find some Russian.
He's ranked 11 in Australia.

1858
01:52:47.840 --> 01:52:51.380
They didn't want to take him off that mark.
Mark Hunt.
Francis makes sense.

1859
01:52:51.381 --> 01:52:55.240
More con jds makes sense.
He'd give him a big name so we can start Jim.

1860
01:52:55.250 --> 01:52:58.100
Then he'd give him a title shot jds or he fought Mark Hunt.

1861
01:52:58.170 --> 01:53:00.800
Remember Jda deal kicked him back in the day.

1862
01:53:01.640 --> 01:53:05.000
But I don't know if Jay Dee has is the same anymore.
Definitely not.

1863
01:53:05.360 --> 01:53:09.710
Still tough character.
Yeah,
he beat Rothwell or mill that super looking for.

1864
01:53:09.740 --> 01:53:11.480
He looked good against Rothwell great.

1865
01:53:11.720 --> 01:53:14.990
And I think that's when a rock wall mighta Pete electric

1866
01:53:16.850 --> 01:53:21.620
like drink.
It's true.
And then,
okay cane.
Obviously we're missing cane.

1867
01:53:21.890 --> 01:53:24.650
But the reason why we're missing Cain is we're not completely convinced that

1868
01:53:24.651 --> 01:53:29.090
Keynes healthy.
No,
we have no idea when he's going up fight.
Yeah.
I mean,

1869
01:53:29.930 --> 01:53:33.900
who knows?
God Watch friends,
his first cane because canes fighting Steve Bay.

1870
01:53:33.901 --> 01:53:36.620
Next one,
he's healthy.
That's the fight they're going to make.

1871
01:53:36.650 --> 01:53:40.550
That's what they want to make.
Yeah,
but man,
I mean that when he's healthy,

1872
01:53:40.551 --> 01:53:45.020
those are three weird words.
Kill.
Those are kind of key.
Is he retiring?

1873
01:53:51.420 --> 01:53:52.800
<v 3>Make some noise please.</v>

1874
01:53:54.400 --> 01:53:56.200
<v 1>I thought it sounded like Dan Horn.
I said,
I love you.</v>

1875
01:54:00.450 --> 01:54:04.050
He said,
I'm sure we'll see improved.
Stefan's drew.

1876
01:54:04.051 --> 01:54:07.900
When he's ready to return to the octagon.
Look at my bow tie.

1877
01:54:10.780 --> 01:54:14.210
I just feel like at heavyweight,
so let's say k,
let's say cane,

1878
01:54:14.211 --> 01:54:17.640
we getting healthy so you have steep a cane next,
which was amazing.

1879
01:54:17.641 --> 01:54:21.330
Fight just went over for Breesa was awful.

1880
01:54:22.140 --> 01:54:27.120
Frances,
Alastair man or Mark Hunt.
So Mark Hahn's fighting that.

1881
01:54:27.121 --> 01:54:31.650
Uh,
is that,
is it more counselors Phi that Merson cat.

1882
01:54:32.100 --> 01:54:36.660
What do you think about DC versus DPA?
Love it.

1883
01:54:36.720 --> 01:54:39.870
I like dcs in that fight too.
He's got a real good chance.

1884
01:54:40.500 --> 01:54:45.500
DC was a murderer at heavyweight beat does show a Josh Barnett not losing any

1885
01:54:46.201 --> 01:54:49.350
weight.
Didn't cut a goddamn thing shorter than everybody.

1886
01:54:49.530 --> 01:54:53.700
Throw him around like frisbees or straight up.

1887
01:54:54.160 --> 01:54:58.290
God Damn those look after seven and both divisions,

1888
01:54:58.320 --> 01:55:02.460
it gets super suspect.
They see it says,
see,
it says champion Jon Jones.

1889
01:55:02.460 --> 01:55:06.900
It should just be a.dot.
Dot.
For now it should be needle needle needle.

1890
01:55:07.260 --> 01:55:08.940
Oh,
I'm sorry.
Is that too much?

1891
01:55:09.780 --> 01:55:14.370
Just pith pills be like A.
Dot.
Dot,
dot,
dot.

1892
01:55:14.460 --> 01:55:18.300
We get the fights coming up.
So UFC fight,
not fight night rock called branch.

1893
01:55:18.510 --> 01:55:23.430
Okay.
Shogun st Prue to how dare you personally though.
That's on banking.

1894
01:55:23.431 --> 01:55:28.260
On baby.
Yeah.
That's a good fight.
But I like Rockhold branch to men.
I really do.

1895
01:55:28.261 --> 01:55:32.160
I liked that fight.
Nunez shift.
Gencos fun.
Yeah.
That's going to be fun.
Oh,

1896
01:55:32.161 --> 01:55:34.860
you're doing that one?
Yeah.
Yeah,
I am doing that one.
Yeah,

1897
01:55:34.920 --> 01:55:37.500
I was going to be in Edmonton as it is,

1898
01:55:37.770 --> 01:55:39.810
but now they have to world title fights on the card.

1899
01:55:39.990 --> 01:55:43.020
So then they have the bantamweight title and then they have mighty mouse to

1900
01:55:43.620 --> 01:55:46.290
mighty mouse ray board.
Yeah,
that's a weird one,
right?

1901
01:55:46.291 --> 01:55:48.890
Because mighty mouse wants to break the record and he,
uh,

1902
01:55:48.930 --> 01:55:51.240
he had an opportunity to break the record if he fought TJ.

1903
01:55:51.270 --> 01:55:54.450
And a lot of people like trimming the Tj fight down and I heard the African,

1904
01:55:54.451 --> 01:55:57.300
I'm good money.
And he still was like,
Nah,
Kimmy Ray Borg.

1905
01:55:58.140 --> 01:56:03.140
We said he wants Tj to fight someone at 125 pounds first.

1906
01:56:03.760 --> 01:56:07.560
And so you want to know that it can make the way in May and get away.
Even Tj,

1907
01:56:07.730 --> 01:56:10.850
you know,
he was like,
I can make do it as on track to make weight,
you know?

1908
01:56:11.040 --> 01:56:13.560
I don't know.
It sounds like an excuse from Dj.
I love Dj,

1909
01:56:13.950 --> 01:56:18.180
but also him fight and Ray Borg while he's really close to history.
I mean,

1910
01:56:18.181 --> 01:56:21.450
I get it.
I get it.
I get it.
I don't,
because you want to be a star.

1911
01:56:21.680 --> 01:56:24.970
You gotta fight Tj fight Dominic Cruz.
You got to fight Cody.
Garbrandt yeah,

1912
01:56:25.320 --> 01:56:28.400
you're just going to stay beat.
Like,
you know ray boards.

1913
01:56:28.410 --> 01:56:33.060
A monster has a great nickname,
tells Mexican devil for God sakes.
However,

1914
01:56:34.080 --> 01:56:35.910
Mrs [inaudible] but it does not.

1915
01:56:35.911 --> 01:56:39.790
It does nothing for Demetrius besides I guess breaking the record.
Right.

1916
01:56:39.810 --> 01:56:44.100
But he might not even make the weight.
Ray Boggs miss to wait a couple of times.

1917
01:56:45.210 --> 01:56:48.860
There's a lot going on.
How many times were Ray Borg missed weight?
See,

1918
01:56:48.870 --> 01:56:51.180
we could find that.
I want to say he's missed it twice.

1919
01:56:52.250 --> 01:56:55.680
It's a tricky weight class.
It's like when John Linacre was the,
the big thing,

1920
01:56:55.710 --> 01:56:59.790
everybody's thinking about him fighting for the title that he was just too big.

1921
01:57:00.330 --> 01:57:03.690
He just couldn't do it.
He just missed it.
Half the time.

1922
01:57:04.590 --> 01:57:06.450
Headline had Ray Borg,
sick of fans.

1923
01:57:07.380 --> 01:57:11.030
So what it said said sick fans are missing weight.
Hmm.

1924
01:57:11.040 --> 01:57:13.440
When we got here and just say,
let me know when you find it Jeremy.

1925
01:57:13.680 --> 01:57:17.580
But like ray board versus Dj does,
it does nothing.
No one cares.

1926
01:57:20.010 --> 01:57:23.220
Yeah.
Yeah.
It doesn't.
No one cares.

1927
01:57:23.221 --> 01:57:26.880
But it does get them to that magical number for personal reasons.

1928
01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:31.410
It's good powerful lizard on his shirt for personal reasons.
Good for DJ.

1929
01:57:31.470 --> 01:57:34.500
Why does he have a lizard or on a shirt?
Cause lizards are awesome.

1930
01:57:34.550 --> 01:57:39.500
This is super in Elizabeth.
I don't know man.
That's a good question.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1931
01:57:39.510 --> 01:57:41.910
I like fancy stuff.
I have not put a lizard on my city.

1932
01:57:42.480 --> 01:57:46.320
I want you to weigh this Putin lizard.
Maybe it stands for something.

1933
01:57:46.860 --> 01:57:51.270
It stands for love Dan.
Where the Lizard,

1934
01:57:51.720 --> 01:57:56.160
the Lizard from Hulu.
What would I do to explain it?
Doesn't damn want to fight.

1935
01:57:56.850 --> 01:57:58.350
Yeah,
they fucked him over man.

1936
01:57:58.351 --> 01:58:02.970
He's got like some issue with his heart that is totally non life threatening and

1937
01:58:03.060 --> 01:58:06.260
he's in fantastic shape where he was before he uh,

1938
01:58:06.930 --> 01:58:11.280
stepped away and they were saying that he has like an irregular heartbeat.

1939
01:58:11.310 --> 01:58:15.330
Like he has an extra heartbeat.
There's just,
when there's with that stuff,

1940
01:58:15.331 --> 01:58:18.870
you know,
it's tough man.
It's such a risk for the commissions,

1941
01:58:18.871 --> 01:58:22.070
the ground to fight.
Let's say his harp fucking exploded in the room.
Shit,

1942
01:58:22.320 --> 01:58:26.670
I don't know man.
I don't think anything.
I think he's fine but also fit.

1943
01:58:27.030 --> 01:58:30.780
What's he going to do?
What do you do Dan?
Like you're great.
You're great.

1944
01:58:30.781 --> 01:58:32.040
A competent.
He got this Gig.

1945
01:58:32.160 --> 01:58:37.100
We can do stop doing that and can come back and compete at one 70 you beaten

1946
01:58:37.110 --> 01:58:37.943
Woodley.

1947
01:58:39.990 --> 01:58:44.990
I think you come back at one five to 55 it doesn't even look very lean.

1948
01:58:45.520 --> 01:58:49.000
It doesn't look the same anymore.
True.
True knows.

1949
01:58:50.530 --> 01:58:54.880
Who knows?
I missed it twice.
Twice,
twice.
One.
Both of those fights.
Yeah.

1950
01:58:55.120 --> 01:58:58.840
See that ain't good though.
It's not good.
It's not good.

1951
01:58:58.841 --> 01:59:02.050
When you've got a guy with a lot of pressure on him headed towards the title,

1952
01:59:02.150 --> 01:59:06.100
do you start looking for excuses?
They start,
you know,
if you lost,

1953
01:59:06.600 --> 01:59:09.580
if you took on two separate occasions,
you haven't made the weight.

1954
01:59:11.030 --> 01:59:12.850
That's like the argument with Khabib.
Right.

1955
01:59:12.851 --> 01:59:16.720
We've been a lot of fight in between those two fights he did.
Who'd he lose to?

1956
01:59:16.780 --> 01:59:20.680
Justin Scoggins.
Scoggins is no fucking joke.
Tough customer.

1957
01:59:20.690 --> 01:59:22.330
Where's he at these days?

1958
01:59:24.780 --> 01:59:28.420
One 25 just it does nothing for me.
I'm a scientist.

1959
01:59:28.930 --> 01:59:31.820
I know it's mighty skew.
Pound for pound number one.
Yeah.

1960
01:59:32.450 --> 01:59:34.400
He's still your number one.
He is now for sure.
I'm,

1961
01:59:34.401 --> 01:59:37.110
Tom was my number one after a in DC.
But yeah,

1962
01:59:37.180 --> 01:59:40.590
I moved John Closer to the number one position.
Although I've seen,

1963
01:59:40.610 --> 01:59:42.940
I think there are debatable and changeable.
Um,

1964
01:59:43.060 --> 01:59:46.990
cause I think mighty mouse wins in these spectacular ways who,
but again,

1965
01:59:46.991 --> 01:59:49.210
so that's the big,
he's beaten and you know,

1966
01:59:49.211 --> 01:59:54.130
it's not like that's the toughest division at all.
Wow.
He lost it.
Pedro Munoz.

1967
01:59:54.190 --> 01:59:59.020
God Damn,
who is that Oh word.
Those are the two guys.

1968
02:00:02.230 --> 02:00:06.060
Hm.
Interesting.
Um,
but yeah,
one point,
the stocking,

1969
02:00:06.460 --> 02:00:10.090
the only argument with the mighty mouse is who is he beating?
You know,
the five.

1970
02:00:10.110 --> 02:00:14.170
So Hutto was seven to know.
God Sakes.
Yeah.
Well,
you know what man,

1971
02:00:14.171 --> 02:00:16.840
there's a lot of like soup,
protect and go guys and that division,

1972
02:00:17.800 --> 02:00:19.500
I just feel like there's no one mean.

1973
02:00:19.501 --> 02:00:23.620
So Hutto was really green in terms of MMA.

1974
02:00:23.800 --> 02:00:27.130
I mean he really had not been fighting MMA that long.
He's fantastic wrestler,

1975
02:00:27.310 --> 02:00:31.180
but it's MMA experience too much.
Where I'm pleased there's too much too soon.

1976
02:00:31.240 --> 02:00:34.330
Yeah.
But that's a division of [inaudible] seven,
you know,
seven know,

1977
02:00:34.331 --> 02:00:38.590
get the title shot.
There's a lot going on there.
I need to stop being a fatty.
Oh,

1978
02:00:38.591 --> 02:00:40.840
that's a good,
well that helps me feel comfortable.

1979
02:00:40.841 --> 02:00:43.320
You gotta Make Weight Ray Borg on missing way.

1980
02:00:43.330 --> 02:00:47.230
I need to stop being a fatty that sees like fat shaming himself.

1981
02:00:47.740 --> 02:00:51.000
I'm not behind that.
Um,
so it's,
it's the,

1982
02:00:51.010 --> 02:00:55.000
the Co main event them and then Nunez shift.
Chanko yeah.

1983
02:00:55.030 --> 02:00:58.270
How many papers have you buys some that do and he gets you tell me

1984
02:00:59.800 --> 02:01:03.790
Neil Magni dos Anjos Ooh,
that's actually interesting.
Hofeld Los Angeles back.

1985
02:01:04.750 --> 02:01:06.280
What do you think you can do at one 70?

1986
02:01:06.400 --> 02:01:09.910
You Look God damn good in his debut at one 70.

1987
02:01:10.290 --> 02:01:14.430
So it's talking about dos Anjos he looked,
he looked very good against Terex.

1988
02:01:14.431 --> 02:01:18.680
Half a dean.
It did look good.
He looks thick as fuck guy.

1989
02:01:18.690 --> 02:01:20.890
He's like shred in that picture and that's how he looks.

1990
02:01:20.891 --> 02:01:23.950
And he's fighting to pursue thought of.
And the picture pretty.

1991
02:01:23.951 --> 02:01:27.850
You thought of no comment.
Uh,
shading angles,

1992
02:01:28.980 --> 02:01:33.390
tanning shit.
It's Graham filters.
Those are filters,
Bro.
Dude,

1993
02:01:33.490 --> 02:01:37.090
I'll tell you the funniest fight on that card.
Jeremy Stephens,
uh,
Melendez.

1994
02:01:37.091 --> 02:01:40.280
Gilbert Melendez.
That's right.
Nobody even thought about that.

1995
02:01:40.340 --> 02:01:43.340
<v 0>That's the flooding.
That's a phenomenal fight.
It's a good one.</v>

1996
02:01:43.430 --> 02:01:45.770
That's a chaos fight.
Yes.
So wait a minute,

1997
02:01:45.771 --> 02:01:49.130
is El Nino going down to 45 or is Jeremy Stevens going up?

1998
02:01:49.580 --> 02:01:52.070
It's 45 it says it there.

1999
02:01:52.640 --> 02:01:57.580
It's 45 so Gilbert is cutting weight down to 45 has he ever done that before
too?

2000
02:01:57.590 --> 02:02:02.450
They still have fucking jds and Frances on this card.
I'd take that to here.

2001
02:02:02.451 --> 02:02:06.110
You take that down to that and be like,
what the fuck?

2002
02:02:09.710 --> 02:02:13.550
Where?
Um,
what,
what way does it,

2003
02:02:13.551 --> 02:02:15.920
does it say most positive?

2004
02:02:15.921 --> 02:02:20.210
It's 45 so he's cutting weight and he's going down to 45 that's crazy.

2005
02:02:20.930 --> 02:02:25.730
That's interesting.
Boy,
I don't know.
I just never done that before.
And he's like,

2006
02:02:25.731 --> 02:02:27.730
he's got to be like 35 36 no,

2007
02:02:29.150 --> 02:02:31.970
35 so he really is,

2008
02:02:32.070 --> 02:02:34.310
see it says one 55 there.

2009
02:02:35.480 --> 02:02:39.950
We'll find out.
We'll find out soon.

2010
02:02:40.430 --> 02:02:43.370
Anything more to add?
Brennan shop before we wrap this bitch up?

2011
02:02:44.120 --> 02:02:47.860
I don't think so man.
It's been a real spin real fast.

2012
02:02:47.870 --> 02:02:51.080
And then we got back together and did one of these.
Huh?
Even with a half a crew,

2013
02:02:51.170 --> 02:02:53.570
half the crew.
We have no conspiracies with Eddie.

2014
02:02:53.780 --> 02:02:58.730
Brian nut drop in some old school knowledge.
You're lucky because in Rotterdam,

2015
02:02:58.731 --> 02:03:02.270
I'm sure that some gems for you.
Yeah,
he probably explained the government to us.

2016
02:03:02.570 --> 02:03:06.860
He was explaining this whole government system and then Eddie,
I went,
man,

2017
02:03:07.280 --> 02:03:10.240
I feel a little flat today in any way.
Did you say flat?
Yeah.

2018
02:03:10.310 --> 02:03:12.890
And then just went off and he's full on these days.

2019
02:03:12.891 --> 02:03:17.490
Apparently they were debating whether or not these crazy North Korea is really

2020
02:03:17.510 --> 02:03:21.820
like what's happening in North Korea.
Like he doesn't believe any of it.
And uh,

2021
02:03:21.890 --> 02:03:24.440
they were debating like,
why you don't fall off the earth?

2022
02:03:24.441 --> 02:03:25.274
Is that what was going on?

2023
02:03:26.920 --> 02:03:31.040
If the earth is spinning so fast and we're going so fast through and on a turn,

2024
02:03:31.370 --> 02:03:35.930
how come we're not just flying off of it?
And when you say debating pain,
who,
uh,

2025
02:03:35.931 --> 02:03:37.250
other dudes that are there with them,

2026
02:03:39.380 --> 02:03:42.650
it's like one of those things where you could find out about gravity.

2027
02:03:42.680 --> 02:03:46.490
You just do a Google search and you know,
read some papers about how,

2028
02:03:46.940 --> 02:03:49.550
how mass works and you know,

2029
02:03:49.551 --> 02:03:53.350
how it works in space and what gravity is and what causes the force of gravity

2030
02:03:53.351 --> 02:03:57.410
and talk.
It's all,
they've done experiments for hundreds of years.
It's fake news.

2031
02:03:58.540 --> 02:04:02.480
Fake News.
I think he's enjoying himself.
I think half the fun.

2032
02:04:02.570 --> 02:04:04.670
We don't think he really believes it.
I think he does,

2033
02:04:04.970 --> 02:04:08.090
but half the reason why he believes his cause he's enjoying himself.

2034
02:04:08.360 --> 02:04:10.790
Like he's like,
he's,

2035
02:04:11.240 --> 02:04:16.230
he's spicing up life with these wacky conspiracies.
Like everything's Goddamn,

2036
02:04:16.250 --> 02:04:17.270
consider everything.

2037
02:04:17.720 --> 02:04:22.270
You never hear Eddie like look at something that's in the news and go,
wow,

2038
02:04:22.340 --> 02:04:24.440
it's probably,
we're just looking into it too much.

2039
02:04:25.920 --> 02:04:29.600
Everything like you and that Chester with Bennington to Lincoln Park Guy,

2040
02:04:29.601 --> 02:04:32.980
he's like,
you know about that,
right?
Like I don't,
I don't man,

2041
02:04:33.080 --> 02:04:36.140
I def definitely don't.
But the problem with Darwin is man,

2042
02:04:36.141 --> 02:04:40.810
like the guy's dead and if he killed himself and he's got kids and a family got

2043
02:04:40.940 --> 02:04:45.180
six kids,
Mr. Rowe get out six kids,
that's a hard one.

2044
02:04:45.360 --> 02:04:47.030
It's a hard pill to swallow.
Swallow.
Yeah.

2045
02:04:47.700 --> 02:04:51.150
But also I think you need people like getting this word.
I want,

2046
02:04:51.450 --> 02:04:53.100
I like that he's in the world.

2047
02:04:53.220 --> 02:04:55.860
Like I don't want everyone to agree with all the news.
Oh,

2048
02:04:55.890 --> 02:04:57.990
well I think it's fun to a certain point.

2049
02:04:58.170 --> 02:05:00.750
Well that's one of the reasons why Eddie says your Jujitsu genius,

2050
02:05:00.930 --> 02:05:04.110
cause he marches to the beat of his own drummer.
I mean he really does.

2051
02:05:04.260 --> 02:05:06.780
He has like ideas in his head and then he's just like,

2052
02:05:06.810 --> 02:05:08.970
we're gonna make this fucking work.
But when you say drum,

2053
02:05:08.971 --> 02:05:11.820
it's not like your standard drum.
It's like a star ship drum.

2054
02:05:11.850 --> 02:05:14.810
And there's that alien with seven arms banging the word.

2055
02:05:15.380 --> 02:05:19.470
We not sure if the eclipse is a real,
if NASA NASA hopes to sell sunglasses.

2056
02:05:21.720 --> 02:05:26.670
Ah,
see I enjoy Callen.
It drives them nuts.
But I'm like,

2057
02:05:26.671 --> 02:05:28.590
I want colorful people in the world.
Man.

2058
02:05:28.591 --> 02:05:32.640
Talon is almost as silly in the other direction.
Correct.

2059
02:05:32.670 --> 02:05:35.130
Never believes anything is a conspiracy.
Ever.

2060
02:05:35.190 --> 02:05:38.310
He thinks Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone and he'll tell you about,

2061
02:05:38.311 --> 02:05:42.960
actually you should read Vincent [inaudible] book like,
yeah,
I have.
It sucks.

2062
02:05:42.961 --> 02:05:46.320
You didn't read it.
And I feel like we're in the middle.
You and I usually like,

2063
02:05:46.321 --> 02:05:50.450
I'm like,
I could see that,
you know,
like I get it,
like I'll entertain it but to,

2064
02:05:50.910 --> 02:05:54.990
until we start talking about the earth is flat dom out any shit that doesn't

2065
02:05:54.991 --> 02:05:59.991
really involve me where I don't either have a stake in it or I don't actually

2066
02:06:00.391 --> 02:06:01.440
know what happened.

2067
02:06:01.890 --> 02:06:05.950
I don't have a dog in that fight both sides and I'll,

2068
02:06:06.030 --> 02:06:09.150
I'll swing back and forth in my own head.
Like I'm the,
I'm,

2069
02:06:09.270 --> 02:06:13.480
I don't convince myself my own self.
I like say something,
I'll go man.

2070
02:06:13.500 --> 02:06:17.000
And he'd probably wrong about that and then I'll start arguing against myself as

2071
02:06:17.060 --> 02:06:18.390
well.
What about this dude?

2072
02:06:18.600 --> 02:06:22.170
I was convinced at big foot was actually real for like 20 minutes,

2073
02:06:22.670 --> 02:06:25.350
just like you fucked idiot.
You been no long time ago.

2074
02:06:26.150 --> 02:06:29.400
I was watching the video of big foot,
like the famous video and I was like,

2075
02:06:29.580 --> 02:06:31.680
what if big foot is real and I'm just an asshole?

2076
02:06:32.050 --> 02:06:35.850
Like what did this whole time I would say it's fake.
It's fake,
it's not fake.

2077
02:06:36.150 --> 02:06:39.240
And that poor guy actually capture on film the poor die,

2078
02:06:39.540 --> 02:06:43.560
but see if you send me a little bit of bigfoot expert.
I'm not so close minded.

2079
02:06:43.561 --> 02:06:44.820
I'm just going to shut them down.

2080
02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:48.930
I'm listening to it and then be like maybe till you realize there are no big

2081
02:06:48.931 --> 02:06:49.764
foot experts.

2082
02:06:49.770 --> 02:06:53.520
Every big foot expert you meet is kind of a loon is full of shit or will have

2083
02:06:53.521 --> 02:06:56.490
them as super nice guys.
But when you get like deep them,

2084
02:06:56.580 --> 02:07:00.240
I had one dude on the podcast tell me he would cut his pinky off to find out if

2085
02:07:00.241 --> 02:07:03.000
Sasquatch is real.
He's a grown man.

2086
02:07:05.100 --> 02:07:06.000
I don't know.

2087
02:07:06.150 --> 02:07:11.150
Like I had a guy who wanted to follow the eclipse through all the states I drive

2088
02:07:11.281 --> 02:07:14.560
with.
He flew on a Suitland Dick before or after you put the sunglasses on him.

2089
02:07:14.590 --> 02:07:16.800
See that's why I said he's the guy,

2090
02:07:17.040 --> 02:07:19.470
he's the maintenance guy around my house and told him get the fuck out.

2091
02:07:19.500 --> 02:07:23.130
I can't have you around my kid.
A weird,
weird,
weird,

2092
02:07:24.890 --> 02:07:29.180
some weird people in or a definitely weird.
People are weird,
but it's fun.

2093
02:07:29.610 --> 02:07:32.130
All that stuff over and over and over again.
It looks easy.

2094
02:07:32.131 --> 02:07:34.200
Clips over and over and over.
We got these classes.

2095
02:07:34.230 --> 02:07:38.050
I could look at a picture of the eclipse and go,
I get it.
Yep.
Good.

2096
02:07:38.620 --> 02:07:41.560
I'm fucking good.
I'm good.

2097
02:07:42.340 --> 02:07:46.240
And then he's saying the next one's in like 24 years in Dallas.
Okay,

2098
02:07:46.241 --> 02:07:50.110
I'll be there.
See Ya.
I'll meet you there,
bro.
Talk to you then.
Okay.
He was like,

2099
02:07:50.111 --> 02:07:53.490
I'm going to buy a property down there and rent it out or when the eclipse Tom

2100
02:07:53.500 --> 02:07:57.010
up for the one fucking day.
It's a terrible business.
I super smart.

2101
02:07:57.220 --> 02:08:01.510
Plan for one day,
21 day now fucking clean up.
You make $100.

2102
02:08:02.510 --> 02:08:03.400
You gonna kill it,
Bro.

2103
02:08:03.820 --> 02:08:07.600
How much property you buy in my probably charge him double.
Like what do you do?

2104
02:08:07.630 --> 02:08:07.781
What?

2105
02:08:07.781 --> 02:08:10.510
They're just going to stand outside your house with glasses and they need to get

2106
02:08:10.511 --> 02:08:12.340
back in their car.
Go.
Yeah,
it was done.
That's it.

2107
02:08:12.341 --> 02:08:16.150
They don't need to stay the night for that and doesn't happen on a sun like is

2108
02:08:16.151 --> 02:08:19.960
it the summertime?
Summertime in Dallas.
It's like summertime on the sun.

2109
02:08:19.990 --> 02:08:23.430
Miserable.
It's like you might as well be living on the sun.
Summertime in Dallas,

2110
02:08:23.440 --> 02:08:26.710
like 185 degrees.
You go outside,
you personally the flames.

2111
02:08:26.711 --> 02:08:29.800
No one's going to stand on and say you're fucking stupid house with this weird

2112
02:08:29.820 --> 02:08:31.530
sunglasses.
The thing is who's crazier?

2113
02:08:31.570 --> 02:08:35.320
That guy who falls the clips and he's boring as fuck,

2114
02:08:35.350 --> 02:08:36.640
but at least the eclipse is real.

2115
02:08:36.880 --> 02:08:41.350
Or a guy like Eddie Bravo who believes in big foot flat earth conspiracy

2116
02:08:41.351 --> 02:08:46.330
theories.
Eddie's funnier.
Different.
No,
I'm not saying Eddie.

2117
02:08:47.170 --> 02:08:51.490
Eddie's funny.
However I'm saying who's crazier?
Yes.
Good,
good question.

2118
02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:56.680
What do you think is crazy?
I don't know.
It depends.

2119
02:08:56.681 --> 02:09:00.850
It's a case by case,
you know,
like do you believe in Ghost?
No.

2120
02:09:01.380 --> 02:09:05.790
I'm going to say it's right now.
What you chase big fun?
No.
You believe in ghosts,

2121
02:09:05.800 --> 02:09:10.470
Jamie?
I don't think so.
No.
Oh,
you're open to that.
See if I'm ready right now.

2122
02:09:10.480 --> 02:09:13.540
Go when you said you think so.
I'll go look into it.

2123
02:09:13.720 --> 02:09:16.600
One of the guys that had on my podcast is named Rupert Sheldrake and he has a

2124
02:09:16.601 --> 02:09:19.480
very compelling thought.
He thinks that everything has a memory.

2125
02:09:20.020 --> 02:09:23.620
That memory is not just a function of like your neurons and your brain's

2126
02:09:23.621 --> 02:09:25.180
yourselves.
Because here's the thing,

2127
02:09:25.181 --> 02:09:28.580
you have memories from the time when you were a child,
right?
From Tommy,

2128
02:09:28.590 --> 02:09:29.423
you were a little Kish.

2129
02:09:29.620 --> 02:09:33.190
Almost every cell in your body regenerates every seven years.

2130
02:09:34.300 --> 02:09:36.520
Where's those?
Where are those memories being stored?

2131
02:09:36.610 --> 02:09:38.140
Like where are they in the neurons?

2132
02:09:38.200 --> 02:09:42.160
Like where are your memories that you definitely have of your childhood or are

2133
02:09:42.161 --> 02:09:44.620
those memories not really your memories anymore?

2134
02:09:44.770 --> 02:09:47.500
Is it you remember having those memories?

2135
02:09:47.590 --> 02:09:52.590
So you have sort of like a rehashed version of it that you put or put in your

2136
02:09:52.751 --> 02:09:56.050
head and sort of almost like re telling yourself a story.

2137
02:09:56.800 --> 02:09:58.630
You know what I'm saying?
So you don't like,

2138
02:09:58.631 --> 02:10:01.540
there's a lot of shit that I know happened when I was in high school,

2139
02:10:01.690 --> 02:10:04.870
but quite honestly I don't really have a good memory of it.

2140
02:10:04.920 --> 02:10:06.190
But does that tell you the fact,

2141
02:10:06.220 --> 02:10:11.220
is that just a function of the human brain where it can't remember so much data

2142
02:10:11.501 --> 02:10:15.370
because we only use what seven would they say seven apps?
That's not true.
That's,

2143
02:10:15.380 --> 02:10:18.340
that's 7% of the brain is something that people repeat over and over again.

2144
02:10:18.341 --> 02:10:21.310
It was in that movie,
Lucy.
It's a myth,
is it?
Yes,
absolutely.

2145
02:10:21.980 --> 02:10:24.340
There's different parts of your brain that are responsible for different

2146
02:10:24.341 --> 02:10:28.030
functions,
frontal lobe,
all that.
There's not 7%.
We use your brain.

2147
02:10:28.031 --> 02:10:30.730
You use your whole brain,
the wider some people's brains.

2148
02:10:30.760 --> 02:10:33.800
So I don't mean why are some people's brains like,
you know,

2149
02:10:33.801 --> 02:10:36.320
they can remember to the t when they were a kid,

2150
02:10:36.321 --> 02:10:38.250
like all these memories and there's some people that is,

2151
02:10:38.251 --> 02:10:40.250
don't write anything about better memories.
For sure.

2152
02:10:40.520 --> 02:10:44.780
My memory's pretty good for facts.
Pretty good.
I'm just being,
I mean,
I remember,

2153
02:10:44.850 --> 02:10:47.690
uh,
don't,
don't get me wrong.
It's like,
Oh man,
maybe stop smoking weed.

2154
02:10:47.691 --> 02:10:48.524
You can remember high school,

2155
02:10:48.680 --> 02:10:52.810
I remember who massive amounts of data from high school.
Yeah.

2156
02:10:52.840 --> 02:10:55.070
What I'm saying is I don't have a real memory of it.

2157
02:10:55.280 --> 02:10:57.230
Like I can remember getting laid in high school.
Right.

2158
02:10:57.350 --> 02:11:00.740
I can remember when it happened.
If I could tell you events.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2159
02:11:00.741 --> 02:11:04.580
You remember,
you remember a scary events.
You remember happy events.

2160
02:11:04.581 --> 02:11:06.560
You remember sad events,
you remember big moments,

2161
02:11:06.561 --> 02:11:08.900
big explosions in your consciousness right here.

2162
02:11:08.930 --> 02:11:13.640
Brains you're designed to remember like negative things more so than positive

2163
02:11:13.641 --> 02:11:17.870
things.
Oh yeah,
for sure.
It just gives the Diet.
What are you gonna Remember?

2164
02:11:17.871 --> 02:11:20.210
Positive things all day and pat yourself on the back.
Awesome.

2165
02:11:20.510 --> 02:11:25.280
Hit in the head by a rock,
something to eat you.
I think,
um,
things,

2166
02:11:25.850 --> 02:11:29.000
what we think as a memory,
we'd like to think of a memory.
Like,
look,

2167
02:11:29.180 --> 02:11:31.370
I've got a memory of that fight.

2168
02:11:31.670 --> 02:11:34.130
I've got a memory of that combination that landed.

2169
02:11:34.160 --> 02:11:38.270
I got a memory of Stephan struve crumple it up.
I see it pretty clear right now.

2170
02:11:38.300 --> 02:11:38.600
Right.

2171
02:11:38.600 --> 02:11:42.350
But even right now it's sort of like a little shitty slideshow even right now.

2172
02:11:42.390 --> 02:11:45.540
Cause you see it clearly,
but you also don't care.
Exactly.

2173
02:11:45.541 --> 02:11:48.380
I'm to walk out of here and I won't remember anything about that really.
I know,

2174
02:11:49.310 --> 02:11:52.700
but it just happened.
I mean,
just how it is not important to me.
So I don't try,

2175
02:11:52.760 --> 02:11:53.930
I don't store it away.

2176
02:11:54.080 --> 02:11:58.430
Whereas certain stuff like my sat or my big appointment on Tuesday,

2177
02:11:58.431 --> 02:12:02.040
but you know,
I remember that stuff.
Yeah,
no,
I get it.
Um,

2178
02:12:02.140 --> 02:12:06.140
I remember a lot of like,
I remember flashes of things,

2179
02:12:06.620 --> 02:12:11.060
and this is weird coming from me because I have a very good memory on paper.

2180
02:12:11.300 --> 02:12:14.090
If you think of the amount of things that I can recall during a podcast,

2181
02:12:14.091 --> 02:12:18.260
he amount of fights that I can recall a during broadcasts and in the middle of a

2182
02:12:18.261 --> 02:12:23.110
fight and all the different martial arts moves I have in my head and who used

2183
02:12:23.111 --> 02:12:27.020
them against who and where and what.
But that's,
that's a different thing.

2184
02:12:27.021 --> 02:12:31.640
Those are,
that's knowledge and statistics and numbers.
Numbers and memory.

2185
02:12:31.670 --> 02:12:34.640
And I and I have and our members certain clips of it.

2186
02:12:34.790 --> 02:12:39.620
But as far as like my own life,
like I did two sets last night,

2187
02:12:40.010 --> 02:12:44.960
killed,
don't remember any of it.
We too,
Hi Dad might've been a problem.

2188
02:12:45.710 --> 02:12:47.990
But here's the other,
here's the other thing.
What is this?

2189
02:12:48.170 --> 02:12:50.330
Highly Superior autobiographical memory,

2190
02:12:50.331 --> 02:12:53.690
the detailed recollection of events that occurred in the distant past,

2191
02:12:54.270 --> 02:12:58.670
but like Marilu Henner has,
oh yeah,
she's got it crazy.
She can,
she can tell you,

2192
02:12:58.671 --> 02:13:03.671
you could say February 22nd and she can go in February 22nd,

2193
02:13:03.860 --> 02:13:07.250
1978 you go,
that was the Tuesday.
It's like rain man.
Yeah,
it's brilliant.

2194
02:13:07.550 --> 02:13:09.080
Most people don't tell you that was president.

2195
02:13:09.081 --> 02:13:11.930
And you know what's weird is like there are certain things when people go,

2196
02:13:11.950 --> 02:13:13.910
remember we did this.
I'm like,
God,
not really.

2197
02:13:14.030 --> 02:13:18.670
But then something will trigger it like a smell or a song and then it comes and

2198
02:13:18.680 --> 02:13:21.210
people hold the Nile.
Find the file on the banker.

2199
02:13:21.230 --> 02:13:23.450
It is like you're in your closet digging around.
Like,

2200
02:13:23.451 --> 02:13:27.040
I don't want to look what I got a box.
Oh look at this.
Yeah.

2201
02:13:27.080 --> 02:13:31.380
If you see like some pictures like Whoa,
a smell,
a set,

2202
02:13:31.390 --> 02:13:36.060
someone to say something or a Moviola Cag.
Remember I was at,
yeah.

2203
02:13:36.061 --> 02:13:40.170
That's why it's really dangerous to convict people based on witness testimony.

2204
02:13:40.171 --> 02:13:44.070
If they see a crime,
people,
they don't really remember things.
Right.

2205
02:13:44.160 --> 02:13:46.350
And then I'm sure it,
you know,
the night before,

2206
02:13:46.351 --> 02:13:48.330
like God will remember this and God,

2207
02:13:48.331 --> 02:13:51.690
he is a man animal and they create this narrative that they wished they want to

2208
02:13:51.691 --> 02:13:55.670
see and they think it was real.
And it also a part of it is a real problem if,
uh,

2209
02:13:55.770 --> 02:13:59.430
it was traumatic,
but does this remembering a crime that you didn't commit?

2210
02:13:59.610 --> 02:14:02.970
There's people that can plant false memories and in their own head,

2211
02:14:03.090 --> 02:14:03.930
not in their own head.

2212
02:14:03.931 --> 02:14:06.090
And when they're trying to get false convictions and whatnot,

2213
02:14:06.120 --> 02:14:09.570
they can make fast and stuff they didn't do fuck.
Oh,
that makes sense.

2214
02:14:09.571 --> 02:14:12.990
Because the pressure of being interrogated is crazy for people.

2215
02:14:13.040 --> 02:14:16.500
A lot of people just making a murderer.
Oh boy.
Oh yeah.
Kids,

2216
02:14:16.501 --> 02:14:19.950
I think he got out Brendan,
he fucked the Brendan Name.
But Brendan Udacity,

2217
02:14:20.010 --> 02:14:22.980
there's a lot of people that are not convinced that making a murderer was

2218
02:14:22.981 --> 02:14:26.370
correct.
There's a lot of houses that convinced that it was biased.

2219
02:14:26.371 --> 02:14:29.100
It was biased in the way of making that guy look like he was innocent.

2220
02:14:29.550 --> 02:14:32.940
I heard the same thing is good for the documentary,
like he's innocent.

2221
02:14:32.941 --> 02:14:35.620
But we look into it.
He's a bad,
terrible person.

2222
02:14:35.621 --> 02:14:37.960
It could have very well have been guilty and they framed them.

2223
02:14:37.960 --> 02:14:42.270
That's possible too.
It's like the mark Furhman Oj thing.

2224
02:14:42.450 --> 02:14:46.020
Like people think that Mark Furhman planted those gloves on Oj,

2225
02:14:46.260 --> 02:14:48.780
but who doesn't think Oj was guilty?
But that,

2226
02:14:48.800 --> 02:14:52.570
that was one who thinks Oj is innocent?
Let me know.
Well,

2227
02:14:52.650 --> 02:14:55.230
I live in this little neighborhood so I do shout out to Lj Simpson,

2228
02:14:55.231 --> 02:14:57.370
but I'm sure that Mark Furman,

2229
02:14:57.380 --> 02:15:01.050
that was just for the defense to paint that or the prosecution.
Right.

2230
02:15:01.051 --> 02:15:04.290
Paint that narrative to maybe put that seed in everyone's head,

2231
02:15:04.291 --> 02:15:07.470
but everyone knows fucking Oj did it.
Yeah,
but he planted evidence,

2232
02:15:07.830 --> 02:15:12.360
you know like doing that,
doing that alone.
Sneaky Shit.

2233
02:15:12.990 --> 02:15:16.020
Yeah.
Most people think Oj did.
It does a few people that think like,

2234
02:15:16.021 --> 02:15:19.470
I heard the crazy ones like Oj son did or something like that.
I'm like,
what?

2235
02:15:19.560 --> 02:15:22.710
I'm still balls deep in the Oj stuff.
Anything he does,
I watch it.

2236
02:15:23.310 --> 02:15:27.570
But like I said,
my brother went,
God I,
I went,
God,

2237
02:15:27.571 --> 02:15:30.480
I wish I really knew the truth about o j and j.
My brother looks at me,
he goes,

2238
02:15:30.481 --> 02:15:33.450
are you shitting me?
Like we all know the truth man.

2239
02:15:33.750 --> 02:15:37.080
But people put all these different stories out there where you're like,
God,

2240
02:15:37.081 --> 02:15:40.560
maybe you didn't do it,
but I just want to know for a fact like that.
Like what?

2241
02:15:40.561 --> 02:15:43.410
How did it really go down?
Do you think he's ever going to come out and be like,

2242
02:15:43.440 --> 02:15:45.570
listen,
no,
no,
I don't think he did.

2243
02:15:45.600 --> 02:15:47.730
I don't think he necessarily remembers anymore.

2244
02:15:48.090 --> 02:15:49.530
You think he was just in a frenzy?

2245
02:15:49.710 --> 02:15:54.710
I think it's entirely possible that he's a sociopath and a narcissist with brain

2246
02:15:54.751 --> 02:15:56.370
trauma,
brain trauma.

2247
02:15:56.520 --> 02:16:00.300
And I think that a lot of times narcissists and sociopaths like to that degree,

2248
02:16:00.720 --> 02:16:04.230
like he's just charming the world.
Hey,
I'm Oj Simpson.
I'm a good guy.

2249
02:16:04.590 --> 02:16:08.670
I've always been a good guy.
Basically the conflict free life,
Yo,

2250
02:16:08.760 --> 02:16:12.420
I just want to go be with my family.
Got a sounds like a man.

2251
02:16:12.450 --> 02:16:14.310
He's got a weird thing going on man.

2252
02:16:14.311 --> 02:16:17.550
Like he's trying to paint this image all day long of him being a good guy.

2253
02:16:17.570 --> 02:16:17.880
Meanwhile,

2254
02:16:17.880 --> 02:16:22.680
he's got these demons and knows dad was gay and they said that's why he beat

2255
02:16:22.681 --> 02:16:24.900
like a lot like you so upset about that.
See,

2256
02:16:24.901 --> 02:16:28.700
I don't trust that guy when he gave that,
uh,
you know,

2257
02:16:28.730 --> 02:16:31.070
he's like snapped at the judge.
Yeah.

2258
02:16:31.210 --> 02:16:33.970
A little part of that was super weird and you definitely shouldn't do that when

2259
02:16:33.971 --> 02:16:37.660
you're trying to get upset about something.
Corrected him on something.

2260
02:16:37.661 --> 02:16:40.790
He's like I said I wasn't there or something like that.
I forget what it,

2261
02:16:40.820 --> 02:16:44.050
what it was like the Las Vegas Room definitely didn't handle it well.
Who?

2262
02:16:44.051 --> 02:16:48.340
Look man,
when you're a man and you're locked up with other men,
you know,

2263
02:16:48.370 --> 02:16:52.270
as prisoners all day long forever.
It's just,

2264
02:16:52.410 --> 02:16:54.040
it's a horrific existence.

2265
02:16:54.520 --> 02:16:58.480
It's amazing that he was able to get through it at all and then still pull off

2266
02:16:58.481 --> 02:17:02.890
that kind of charm and not can only do so.
Yeah,
he was killing it in there.

2267
02:17:03.130 --> 02:17:05.320
Like he was the prime example of a,

2268
02:17:05.590 --> 02:17:09.360
of a prisoner and it was like he started organizing church groups and like

2269
02:17:09.700 --> 02:17:12.940
feeding everyone's lunches and like,
he was cool.
Wow.

2270
02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:15.970
Well you find meaning in that shit.
I wonder if you'd like,

2271
02:17:15.971 --> 02:17:20.160
has like a deep what's going on?
He's Chloe's dad.
Yeah.

2272
02:17:20.180 --> 02:17:23.230
Lot of people think he's closed.
Dad Get the fuck out of here.
What?

2273
02:17:23.810 --> 02:17:27.910
Chloe's not half black.
Uh,
well they just don't love black guys.

2274
02:17:27.911 --> 02:17:30.820
They is that what it is?
Hmm?

2275
02:17:30.910 --> 02:17:35.000
Some people do well and you know Oj was super close with strong rumor.

2276
02:17:35.230 --> 02:17:40.030
That shit strong rumor.
It's strong.
No one be surprised.

2277
02:17:40.300 --> 02:17:41.133
Uh,
I would,

2278
02:17:43.940 --> 02:17:48.220
well my point was like what kind of memory of the event?
Okay.

2279
02:17:48.221 --> 02:17:51.700
We both agree he did it right.
So if he did it,
what kind of memory does he have?

2280
02:17:51.701 --> 02:17:55.670
Do you remember sticking the knife in them?
I remember that traumatic event.

2281
02:17:55.900 --> 02:17:57.130
I wonder,
I wonder,

2282
02:17:57.280 --> 02:18:00.280
I wonder if you're a sociopath and I wonder if you've been telling people for

2283
02:18:00.281 --> 02:18:01.840
all these years that you're innocent.

2284
02:18:02.400 --> 02:18:04.510
I'm all you remap trying to find the real killer.

2285
02:18:05.860 --> 02:18:08.230
I'm trying to get out of it upon the real killer.
Everyone's all,

2286
02:18:08.330 --> 02:18:12.370
not once did he bring up the real killer.
I'm trying to find my wife's killer.

2287
02:18:12.580 --> 02:18:13.960
The reason why,
I mean,

2288
02:18:13.961 --> 02:18:18.130
he never said that during any of the parole thing when he can't get out.
Oh No,

2289
02:18:18.131 --> 02:18:21.490
not my wife's killer.
Yeah.
Never on this.
Someone killed my wife.

2290
02:18:21.491 --> 02:18:24.760
That's ship's sailed a lot of time.
Me,
I'm being tried for it.

2291
02:18:24.761 --> 02:18:27.760
I'm being unjustly accused.
He didn't say that case that I lost,

2292
02:18:28.240 --> 02:18:32.080
he came out with a book.
If I did it.
Yeah,
he was going to,

2293
02:18:32.110 --> 02:18:34.750
but he didn't release that book.
I thought he did.

2294
02:18:34.810 --> 02:18:39.370
Not all the proceeds went to the the gold.
No.
Um,
I believe,

2295
02:18:39.400 --> 02:18:43.400
I'm pretty sure that the publishing company backed out of that price.

2296
02:18:43.401 --> 02:18:47.160
Smart on their part.
Yeah.
You can't do that,
dude,

2297
02:18:47.540 --> 02:18:48.940
while you have them on the podcast.

2298
02:18:50.590 --> 02:18:51.610
<v 8>Oh,</v>

2299
02:18:54.020 --> 02:18:58.820
<v 0>I don't know if he would do it,
but if he did do it,
yeah,
I have them on.</v>

2300
02:18:58.880 --> 02:19:03.680
Yeah.
Right.
Yeah,
I'd have to Amman,
I did it
shit up.

2301
02:19:03.681 --> 02:19:06.680
IDF is right.
It's hidden right there.
Remember?
That's what they had to do.
Oh,

2302
02:19:06.681 --> 02:19:07.514
that's right.

2303
02:19:08.180 --> 02:19:12.590
If I did it in the eye and on Amazon by j Simpson.

2304
02:19:12.980 --> 02:19:14.780
Jesus Christ.
That's,
that's still,

2305
02:19:14.900 --> 02:19:19.130
I thought they pulled that confessions of the killer in all caps,

2306
02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:24.080
all that Goldman and Kim Goldman.
Nick,
that's how it happened.
They had to,

2307
02:19:25.010 --> 02:19:27.350
they're,
they're getting all money,

2308
02:19:28.180 --> 02:19:32.200
<v 1>all the money,
but in did he really right,
the full story.
Yeah.</v>

2309
02:19:32.201 --> 02:19:36.120
Where did the rights to them because double jeopardy,
right?

2310
02:19:36.130 --> 02:19:39.350
Can't be make money off the crime is sorta what it is.

2311
02:19:39.950 --> 02:19:42.830
How much money do and also they have a civil case against him.

2312
02:19:43.100 --> 02:19:46.100
How much money you think he made off that book to God.

2313
02:19:46.101 --> 02:19:48.920
You don't make that much money off books unless you're just fucking,

2314
02:19:49.070 --> 02:19:50.750
you do feel like Bill O'reilly,

2315
02:19:50.900 --> 02:19:55.610
k Rollins or some shit if you're writing books are like old people read by a lot

2316
02:19:55.611 --> 02:19:59.870
of books.
If I did it,
but we kind of know how you'd do it.
If he did it.

2317
02:19:59.920 --> 02:20:04.100
Is it really need to read the kitchen knife or stab both of them go to Chicago,

2318
02:20:04.400 --> 02:20:07.430
called the lawyers,
come back,
come back,
act dumb.

2319
02:20:09.280 --> 02:20:13.010
Kadash and helps me out.
Rinse,
repeat.
Does it say how many books?

2320
02:20:13.870 --> 02:20:18.170
So many books they sold?
I'm looking down.
I got to think it was not much.

2321
02:20:18.530 --> 02:20:20.690
I don't even know it was out and I'm all about this.

2322
02:20:21.980 --> 02:20:23.990
He got some sort of crazy settlement.
Right?

2323
02:20:23.991 --> 02:20:27.620
It was like $35 million settlement or something like that.
33 million.

2324
02:20:28.070 --> 02:20:30.080
But how much has he been paid?

2325
02:20:32.300 --> 02:20:36.890
I used to know is um,
um,
Ron Goldman sister.
Really?

2326
02:20:36.980 --> 02:20:40.150
Yeah.
How'd you know her?
She worked,
um,

2327
02:20:40.550 --> 02:20:44.630
on something that I did for,
she was very nice.
Very cool check.

2328
02:20:44.631 --> 02:20:49.631
Brian ran into the dad in Phoenix selling men's shirts.

2329
02:20:50.900 --> 02:20:54.500
What's the big paws?
Men's,
I was trying to think what is selling,

2330
02:20:54.501 --> 02:20:56.930
but I remember sound like men's golf shirts or some shit.

2331
02:20:56.931 --> 02:21:01.010
Like the struggle is real for Ron Goldman,
you know,
like game over,

2332
02:21:01.011 --> 02:21:03.450
you lose a child and it goes down like that.
Just,

2333
02:21:03.451 --> 02:21:07.760
just hard believe that that guy is now going to get out.
What do you do?

2334
02:21:07.761 --> 02:21:11.120
I mean you only got certain amount of time left on this planet.
I,

2335
02:21:11.450 --> 02:21:14.190
I probably got a hand.
I'd probably,
yeah,
Hammer beat.

2336
02:21:14.220 --> 02:21:17.650
It's going to be tough to get Oj still pretty athletic and black,
so I would,

2337
02:21:18.380 --> 02:21:20.900
I probably get a gun and when he gets out,

2338
02:21:20.930 --> 02:21:23.570
drive down to Florida or if he comes back to Brentwood,

2339
02:21:23.680 --> 02:21:26.580
it's going to make it super easy on you and probably shoot them.

2340
02:21:28.100 --> 02:21:32.570
Could be headed to reality TV.
And when I called,
Oh my God,

2341
02:21:33.940 --> 02:21:37.450
<v 4>watching that documentary about them because I completely forgot about all the</v>

2342
02:21:37.480 --> 02:21:41.710
weird stuff he was doing before he did go to jail and show in Vegas where he
had,

2343
02:21:42.340 --> 02:21:43.180
I didn't even know about it.

2344
02:21:43.181 --> 02:21:46.360
Seeing it on the documentary shows everything I had to do.
Wrap.
Yeah.

2345
02:21:46.361 --> 02:21:50.560
You had a rap song that after he murdered his wife before he went to jail and

2346
02:21:50.561 --> 02:21:52.900
like 2005 or six soon.

2347
02:21:54.760 --> 02:21:55.930
I'm innocent.

2348
02:22:01.800 --> 02:22:04.530
I'm innocent here too.
Good.

2349
02:22:05.170 --> 02:22:09.020
We're going to get pulled off of youtube for the Oj Simpson.
Oh my God.

2350
02:22:09.730 --> 02:22:13.300
Wait a minute.
We got to play this.
Let's,
let's ride.
Let's ride this.

2351
02:22:13.720 --> 02:22:16.420
Give us some volume.
Oh my God.

2352
02:22:21.920 --> 02:22:25.440
Who are these girls?
White face

2353
02:22:28.510 --> 02:22:33.300
<v 8>depth titties out.
God,
this is a real,
this is a real music video.</v>

2354
02:22:34.730 --> 02:22:39.140
<v 0>America's most wanted.
This is crazy.</v>

2355
02:22:39.141 --> 02:22:42.740
He's dressed like Elvis.
I can't believe this is real.

2356
02:22:51.900 --> 02:22:52.733
<v 5>Oh</v>

2357
02:22:53.590 --> 02:22:56.620
<v 0>look,
those Teddy's gimme some volume here.
People hear this,
right?</v>

2358
02:22:56.621 --> 02:23:01.600
People on Youtube are Hannah's.
No.
Oh,
that'll get taken down.
Problem not for you.

2359
02:23:01.620 --> 02:23:04.200
Play just the audio way.

2360
02:23:04.750 --> 02:23:08.950
Oj Simpson get juiced.
What year did this happen?

2361
02:23:09.640 --> 02:23:12.250
Like 2004 2005

2362
02:23:14.760 --> 02:23:16.140
this is insane.

2363
02:23:19.650 --> 02:23:23.310
This is insane.
It's all these girls taking their pants off.

2364
02:23:25.930 --> 02:23:30.390
See,
he was doing a prank show and you got juice was the tag line.
Oh my God.

2365
02:23:31.170 --> 02:23:35.910
He did it.
He did a fucking prank show after he murdered two people.

2366
02:23:36.030 --> 02:23:40.840
He's got a midget on his lap.
This is insane.
I can't believe it.

2367
02:23:40.841 --> 02:23:43.950
I've seen this.
Oh my God.
All you play or haters.

2368
02:23:46.200 --> 02:23:51.180
Get on your knees and get some of these grabbed his crotch.
He said these nuts.

2369
02:23:51.780 --> 02:23:56.410
This is crazy.
And you got to think,

2370
02:23:56.560 --> 02:23:58.780
is this 2005 is that what you said?

2371
02:23:59.020 --> 02:24:03.950
So he's got to be like 60 years old when this is happening.
Damn.

2372
02:24:03.951 --> 02:24:08.840
It only has 15,000 views.
Well,
check in and a couple of days.

2373
02:24:11.150 --> 02:24:13.510
We just helped the juicy stuff.
Think people knew about it,

2374
02:24:13.520 --> 02:24:16.240
but another reason he needs to come on the God damn podcast.
Yeah.

2375
02:24:16.250 --> 02:24:18.850
Maybe it will come on dressed like Elvis again.
No,
no.

2376
02:24:18.860 --> 02:24:23.220
Maybe it come on justice white face.
God Damn.
This is nuts.
He's a terrible,

2377
02:24:23.590 --> 02:24:26.870
yeah.
I wonder if he was like,
look,
I rarely,

2378
02:24:26.871 --> 02:24:30.530
I make money and so on through this idea at him.
Look at him with a do rag him.

2379
02:24:31.820 --> 02:24:34.610
Yeah.
Don't piss them off though.
Very strange.

2380
02:24:35.350 --> 02:24:39.550
<v 5>You did a Bingo at like a white face with like a secure I old people home or</v>

2381
02:24:39.551 --> 02:24:39.840
something.

2382
02:24:39.840 --> 02:24:42.030
<v 0>Oh my gosh.
Struggle is real.</v>

2383
02:24:44.800 --> 02:24:49.210
This is so strange.
I can't believe this.

2384
02:24:52.080 --> 02:24:56.940
This rap song where it's like it's hard in the streets in La.
That is true.

2385
02:24:57.120 --> 02:24:59.940
Yeah.
He was like a legit rap song though.
This is the remix Jamie.

2386
02:24:59.970 --> 02:25:02.400
It's got a good point.
Both of them are good.

2387
02:25:04.810 --> 02:25:09.610
We don't need to watch anything on a terrible person.
I wonder what he's,

2388
02:25:09.670 --> 02:25:12.520
I mean I feel like a guy like that probably like would do anything.

2389
02:25:12.521 --> 02:25:13.060
It's like just get,

2390
02:25:13.060 --> 02:25:15.400
we've got to figure out some way to do and who's going to be working with them?

2391
02:25:15.401 --> 02:25:18.950
You're not going to get like the top minds of Hollywood flock?
No,
no one's,

2392
02:25:19.460 --> 02:25:24.080
I mean he might pop up on some reality show,
but dude,
a matching knows hoes.

2393
02:25:24.090 --> 02:25:26.590
They were saying he was getting more women than ever when he got out,

2394
02:25:27.150 --> 02:25:28.600
when he was out of trial,

2395
02:25:28.750 --> 02:25:32.320
they said we went to Florida was just Dick and girls down.

2396
02:25:32.380 --> 02:25:35.890
Now you're killing it.
What ties got out?

2397
02:25:35.980 --> 02:25:40.270
What type of psycho chicks are hooking up with Oj right now?

2398
02:25:40.271 --> 02:25:44.320
Skanks there's people that are attracted to murderous.
It's like,
oh,

2399
02:25:44.410 --> 02:25:49.000
it's a normal thing like serial killers.
Yeah.
It's weird.
Yeah.

2400
02:25:49.001 --> 02:25:53.750
Girls like send pictures and there's something that some women like Charles

2401
02:25:53.750 --> 02:25:56.080
Manson tried to get married and that,
I guess the court was like,

2402
02:25:56.081 --> 02:26:00.930
Nah man or he maybe didn't get mad.
He said it's offered the things off,

2403
02:26:00.931 --> 02:26:04.630
but Charles Manson is ignite crazy bitch.
Yeah.
Madison's like,
look,
look at that.

2404
02:26:04.631 --> 02:26:09.280
Crazy hot and hot pad look at is high and tight fade though.
I liked that too.

2405
02:26:09.340 --> 02:26:12.670
I'm still mad.
A swastika tattooed on his forehead.
That's never gonna go away.

2406
02:26:12.880 --> 02:26:16.960
Come on and get that laser drop,
Bro.
No flood did even more pussy.
Dude.

2407
02:26:16.990 --> 02:26:19.840
Every time he's up for parole,
you ever see him go nuts?

2408
02:26:20.020 --> 02:26:22.450
Like he just fucked himself.
He goes opposite of

2409
02:26:22.610 --> 02:26:26.510
<v 9>fucking hate your garbage,
man.
You made me.</v>

2410
02:26:27.180 --> 02:26:31.640
People may mean your system,
your system.

2411
02:26:34.130 --> 02:26:38.460
<v 0>Nice.
Dunkin looks so much like he doesn't.
That's Grayson Trussell.</v>

2412
02:26:38.500 --> 02:26:42.190
You're racist.
You're fucking Jesus Christ.
So racist.

2413
02:26:43.120 --> 02:26:47.550
He's never getting out.
Imagine that crazy Trump.
We tried man.

2414
02:26:47.660 --> 02:26:50.200
That girl socks,
a Hella deck.

2415
02:26:50.500 --> 02:26:53.540
The meanest thicken the world gobble,
gobble gums.

2416
02:26:53.541 --> 02:26:56.290
She's probably just got moves that you never even heard of before.

2417
02:26:56.350 --> 02:26:58.650
I mean Charles Manson scene at all.
Yeah.

2418
02:26:58.680 --> 02:27:03.460
And he's conjugals does he get to Oh,
shaved their head.
Yup.

2419
02:27:04.030 --> 02:27:07.000
She shaved her head.
Damn.
I bet she's healthy.
That's a bad move,
honey.

2420
02:27:07.060 --> 02:27:09.640
These are eyes would get your wig until that shit grows back.

2421
02:27:10.060 --> 02:27:14.730
Some girls can't pull off the no shirt.
Shaved head test.
Oh my God.

2422
02:27:14.740 --> 02:27:17.770
Cause some girls looked pretty until you shaved their head and take their shirt

2423
02:27:17.771 --> 02:27:21.190
off and you go,
hey,
hey,
hey.
Yeah,
what did,
what did we do here?
What happened?

2424
02:27:22.060 --> 02:27:26.740
What was it?
Who are those people with them?
Said he was being too timed.
Oh,

2425
02:27:26.741 --> 02:27:31.150
she was fucking that other 26 Oh shit.
Oh Shit.
With,

2426
02:27:31.330 --> 02:27:35.530
with the,
the wolf guy,
65 six with his disciple,

2427
02:27:35.740 --> 02:27:36.371
Gray Wolf.

2428
02:27:36.371 --> 02:27:41.260
65 just months after her marriage license to wed the murderer expired,
bro.

2429
02:27:41.261 --> 02:27:45.790
She was getting dicked down by two old dudes.
Manson's 80 what does he expect?

2430
02:27:46.060 --> 02:27:50.080
Well,
she's getting Dick Downward.
Look,
this girl's obviously fucking bananas,

2431
02:27:50.140 --> 02:27:51.670
right?
What does she look like?

2432
02:27:51.671 --> 02:27:53.860
And he looked like get them all together in that picture.
Let me see that.

2433
02:27:53.861 --> 02:27:54.940
Pretty sure.
Damn.

2434
02:27:54.941 --> 02:27:59.080
And that the gray wolf guy got arrested for smuggling a cell phone at that guy.

2435
02:27:59.560 --> 02:28:02.530
He's like sneaky,
sneaky.
Some guys like sneaky bossy.

2436
02:28:02.620 --> 02:28:04.320
They'd like to be friends with a guy and bangs girl.

2437
02:28:04.750 --> 02:28:08.080
Those two old dudes are busting loads in this crazy

2438
02:28:08.840 --> 02:28:10.340
<v 9>ah,</v>

2439
02:28:10.770 --> 02:28:14.850
<v 0>his loads.
All of them have like a swastika on just full of hate.</v>

2440
02:28:14.940 --> 02:28:16.160
Just hate loads.

2441
02:28:17.270 --> 02:28:22.120
Hatless plus a squad car to cartoon.

2442
02:28:23.770 --> 02:28:27.340
Swasti got its forehead like wiggling what?

2443
02:28:27.720 --> 02:28:31.410
Playing for this dead loads.
They come in with like,
you know,

2444
02:28:31.550 --> 02:28:34.030
cartoons and people again,
they have an x for eyes.

2445
02:28:36.020 --> 02:28:39.020
It's just totally dead.
I'd just like a hit,

2446
02:28:39.950 --> 02:28:43.410
you know he kitchen fish and they're dead and their eyes cloud over and this

2447
02:28:43.420 --> 02:28:47.180
sperms looked like zombies for swastika on the forehand

2448
02:28:49.100 --> 02:28:52.950
<v 4>80.
He uh,
he called the marriage off after apparent.</v>

2449
02:28:53.030 --> 02:28:55.310
Maybe he found out that she was going to,

2450
02:28:55.400 --> 02:28:58.730
they're trying to get them to sign a document to give his body to them and they

2451
02:28:58.731 --> 02:29:01.430
were going to put his body in a glass crypt when he died and probably sell

2452
02:29:01.970 --> 02:29:03.350
tickets to some sort of weird.

2453
02:29:03.690 --> 02:29:06.870
<v 0>He's good move.
You can do that to me,
man.</v>

2454
02:29:07.110 --> 02:29:10.980
The fucking government had me in a casket forever.
She

2455
02:29:12.860 --> 02:29:17.100
wait.
So that was too much for Charles Manson.
Great.
You know what?

2456
02:29:17.770 --> 02:29:21.420
You're crazy bitch.
I'm out.
Take a certain amount of crazy.

2457
02:29:21.421 --> 02:29:24.600
If you want to bang a hot 25 year old and you're an eight year old serial
killer.

2458
02:29:24.870 --> 02:29:28.350
If Charles Manson goes,
you're crazy.
What the fuck?

2459
02:29:28.351 --> 02:29:30.440
How do they not arrest her on this cross?

2460
02:29:30.441 --> 02:29:34.810
He may at 27 year olds sought to wed the mastermind or the helter skelter murder

2461
02:29:34.811 --> 02:29:37.980
so that she could gain possession of his remains when he died.

2462
02:29:38.580 --> 02:29:42.780
That is beautiful.
Suck that old.
Oh Dude.

2463
02:29:43.060 --> 02:29:43.800
She had a sock that,

2464
02:29:43.800 --> 02:29:47.970
but you won't put his body in the class case you've were saying that is,

2465
02:29:47.971 --> 02:29:51.420
if that wasn't like,
like that was her plan all along.

2466
02:29:51.540 --> 02:29:55.410
It could have been like her along the way.
She's fucking nuts.
She wants a bank.

2467
02:29:55.411 --> 02:30:00.000
Charles man,
she's got some other nutty ideas to spread his great payments.

2468
02:30:00.200 --> 02:30:03.690
It might not have been some grand conspiracy that she masterminded from the

2469
02:30:03.691 --> 02:30:07.920
beginning.
I know how to get rich.
This is what I'm going to do.
Maybe it was like,

2470
02:30:08.100 --> 02:30:11.580
I'm fucking crazy.
I want to Bang Charles Manson.
What else I want to do?

2471
02:30:12.330 --> 02:30:15.960
I don't want to put his body on a fucking jar and let everybody look at it and

2472
02:30:15.961 --> 02:30:19.840
get them.
People pay a dollar to chuck it out.
Fill them up with formaldehyde.

2473
02:30:19.850 --> 02:30:23.790
Let everybody stare.
She's fucking nuts,
but she's got a lot of crazy ideas.

2474
02:30:23.940 --> 02:30:27.450
Go talk to her.
She'd probably tell you some shit about psychics and aliens,

2475
02:30:27.451 --> 02:30:30.870
but that one really sticks out.
Especially you're Charles Manson.
Not Good.

2476
02:30:31.110 --> 02:30:32.760
Not Good.
A lot of issues.

2477
02:30:32.761 --> 02:30:36.200
There is a lot of issues and you should have her on the puck.
No,

2478
02:30:36.250 --> 02:30:38.010
I should know where the podcast studio is.

2479
02:30:38.011 --> 02:30:39.840
You don't want that bitch finding out what she wants.

2480
02:30:39.850 --> 02:30:43.080
Your body and it's coming out just coming out trying to suck your Dick when he

2481
02:30:43.081 --> 02:30:46.570
get in your car with helter skelter discount down

2482
02:30:48.370 --> 02:30:52.590
the helter skelter and shit.
I love the stance he's got there though.
Look at,

2483
02:30:52.680 --> 02:30:56.460
scroll up to the power stance with the towel behind his neck.
It's got a tower.

2484
02:30:57.240 --> 02:31:01.350
Calisthenics.
That's how I keep my tan.
Nothing but hate.
Suntanning.

2485
02:31:01.380 --> 02:31:03.690
How'd he get Tan?
I just stares at the sun.

2486
02:31:05.730 --> 02:31:09.420
They let them get out,
I guess.
I mean what?
Uh Oh,

2487
02:31:09.421 --> 02:31:11.670
not entitled to a conjugal visit.
Oh.

2488
02:31:12.780 --> 02:31:14.730
<v 10>Oh.</v>

2489
02:31:15.850 --> 02:31:20.850
<v 0>So they never leave him alone with her.
Do you throw a blanket over it?</v>

2490
02:31:20.930 --> 02:31:22.830
Have her give you a handy,
no,
you can't.

2491
02:31:23.310 --> 02:31:27.150
Oh God ain't having that crazy ass.

2492
02:31:27.180 --> 02:31:31.800
What does it say there in Bristow feely?
I was trying to see if that's what,
uh,

2493
02:31:32.130 --> 02:31:36.750
is the term for women who like psychopath killer.
Oh,
not even close.

2494
02:31:36.990 --> 02:31:40.890
Yeah.
She's not even close.
There's a lot of them.
I know that a Richard Ramirez,

2495
02:31:40.950 --> 02:31:45.600
the night stalker,
he,
uh,
he had a bunch of chicks that are trying to marry ahead.

2496
02:31:45.660 --> 02:31:50.310
Bundy was like,
he killed him.
The Gail on the gain of 10 times.

2497
02:31:50.311 --> 02:31:51.690
There's like Tinder for serial killers.

2498
02:31:51.691 --> 02:31:54.030
He's getting swipe less all fucking night.

2499
02:31:54.031 --> 02:31:58.080
Pull that phone out of his ass and just swiping because he comes in.

2500
02:31:59.190 --> 02:32:03.780
No,
that was dom or the hall to Ted Bundy though was a dime piece.

2501
02:32:05.400 --> 02:32:06.210
That was the problem.

2502
02:32:06.210 --> 02:32:11.210
Somebody who was like a famous singer got in his car and realized it.

2503
02:32:12.020 --> 02:32:14.010
Like as she was about to get in the car,

2504
02:32:14.011 --> 02:32:18.420
she realized that the inside of the door did not have any handles on it and she

2505
02:32:18.421 --> 02:32:22.830
freaked out.
Debbie Harry from blondie almost got in his car.

2506
02:32:22.860 --> 02:32:27.390
Like he almost got her tight moved.
Debbie Harry,
Ted Bundy lured her into a car.

2507
02:32:27.450 --> 02:32:29.430
Wow.
She almost fell victims.

2508
02:32:29.480 --> 02:32:32.850
He was the one thing they'll have incomes that charming.
Yeah.

2509
02:32:32.851 --> 02:32:36.450
Well it was Manson isn't,
but a lot of,
well he probably was though.
You know,

2510
02:32:36.451 --> 02:32:41.451
he's like charming and sort of an apocalyptic way where he understands like,

2511
02:32:41.520 --> 02:32:45.990
you know what,
what people want to hear.
They want,
they want some wise old mentor.

2512
02:32:46.020 --> 02:32:48.540
You know,
he's charming for bat shit crazy.
Yeah.

2513
02:32:48.690 --> 02:32:51.240
But there's a lot of those batshit crazy girls out there that want,

2514
02:32:51.480 --> 02:32:54.990
they want you to tell them about the Illuminati.
You know what a dad,
yeah,

2515
02:32:54.991 --> 02:32:59.700
there's,
there's a plan.
All these,
they're starting a race war.

2516
02:32:59.940 --> 02:33:00.510
You know,
there's,

2517
02:33:00.510 --> 02:33:04.200
there's people that want to hear like really nutty shit from some old daddy.

2518
02:33:04.201 --> 02:33:08.130
Dude.
God weird.
It's awesome.

2519
02:33:10.080 --> 02:33:11.940
It's awesome that people like that exist.

2520
02:33:12.450 --> 02:33:16.560
It's awesome that there's a girl who it's like her main goal in life is to fuck

2521
02:33:17.890 --> 02:33:22.080
Charles Manson fish tank.
Put them in a fixed then come on man.

2522
02:33:22.290 --> 02:33:24.030
It makes the world a better place.
No,

2523
02:33:24.031 --> 02:33:28.740
I liked it until they started killing people.
But when they're not a fan of that,

2524
02:33:28.920 --> 02:33:30.090
I would like you to not do that.

2525
02:33:30.120 --> 02:33:33.240
But I'm a fan of you wanting to marry Charles myth and live in a fish tank,

2526
02:33:33.360 --> 02:33:37.070
loving money off of it.
I love that you shaved your head.
You crazy too.

2527
02:33:37.080 --> 02:33:39.780
She and I love that you get tagged him from his old friend.

2528
02:33:40.350 --> 02:33:43.260
She's probably got some really stupid quotes tattooed on her ribs.

2529
02:33:43.380 --> 02:33:47.850
I'll just some hateful quotes,
probably like some demonic con ship,

2530
02:33:47.880 --> 02:33:51.810
something from some ancient book and translated from Latin to English,

2531
02:33:51.870 --> 02:33:55.530
some horrible shit and some horrible shit about the end of times.

2532
02:33:58.080 --> 02:34:02.580
Fuck say ah.
Ah.

2533
02:34:03.480 --> 02:34:07.320
I love it.
I love,
I love all the crazy in the world,
man.

2534
02:34:07.350 --> 02:34:10.770
I don't like the violent crazy.
I don't like when people,
you know what I,

2535
02:34:10.771 --> 02:34:15.450
my faith in humanity is somewhat restored because of Houston cause all the

2536
02:34:15.451 --> 02:34:18.070
videos that I saw all these people rescuing people in Houston,

2537
02:34:18.310 --> 02:34:21.190
I felt super good about that and man,
that made me feel really good.
Yeah.

2538
02:34:21.191 --> 02:34:24.580
Did you see that?
They were saying there's like no looting or anything going on.

2539
02:34:24.581 --> 02:34:26.230
Like some companies coming around and helping each other.

2540
02:34:26.590 --> 02:34:29.250
It'd be easy to lose Texas motherfucker.
They got,

2541
02:34:30.310 --> 02:34:33.070
they got a whole lot of guns.
That is a wrong place to lose,

2542
02:34:33.100 --> 02:34:35.380
but everyone has guns.
Even the criminals,
you know what I'm saying?

2543
02:34:35.381 --> 02:34:37.240
So you could get away with some shit,

2544
02:34:37.241 --> 02:34:39.790
but they're saying everyone's just gathered around helping each other out,

2545
02:34:39.791 --> 02:34:44.190
which is cool.
That's good.
You know,
I think Texas has a good sort of,
uh,
uh,

2546
02:34:44.530 --> 02:34:49.530
pride in taxes and they're being Texans is important to them.

2547
02:34:50.300 --> 02:34:52.300
It's,
it's very different than any other state.

2548
02:34:52.420 --> 02:34:55.060
California is very different than any other state too.
I mean,
it's got its own.

2549
02:34:55.080 --> 02:34:59.230
Every state sorta has its own vibe.
New York obviously has its own vibe,
but man,

2550
02:34:59.260 --> 02:35:02.530
Texas has its own vibe to the point where it's almost another country.
I agree.

2551
02:35:02.650 --> 02:35:05.500
Like Texas,
like if you meet someone from texts,

2552
02:35:05.501 --> 02:35:08.410
they want you to know you're from Texas.
Florida is not like that.
No.

2553
02:35:08.440 --> 02:35:13.090
You don't see people from Miami Super prideful or fucking Fort Lauderdale.
No,

2554
02:35:13.300 --> 02:35:16.840
no.
It's different.
But New York,
they are Boston.
They are deep.

2555
02:35:17.050 --> 02:35:21.720
They all of them don't have it.
Like Texas does.
Texas,
everything is Lone Star,

2556
02:35:22.020 --> 02:35:26.500
Lone Star Barbecue.
Lonestar,
this Texas,
that Texas truck,

2557
02:35:26.590 --> 02:35:30.460
unless plate say Texas truck.
Yeah.
And the different,
it's different.

2558
02:35:31.150 --> 02:35:34.810
It's Texas football.
They were,
they were a republic forever.

2559
02:35:34.960 --> 02:35:36.220
Like they're barely a state.

2560
02:35:37.090 --> 02:35:40.510
Like they were like one of the only states that like had this argument that they

2561
02:35:40.511 --> 02:35:44.340
could leave the country.
They could,
they leave the union point.

2562
02:35:44.860 --> 02:35:49.120
And it's also weird state that they have these giant ass ranches like Texas has.

2563
02:35:49.121 --> 02:35:54.121
He's like 80,000 hundred thousand like gigantic acre ranches to cool.

2564
02:35:55.570 --> 02:35:58.990
Well the,
it's weird.
It's like they're all rent.
They have so many ranches.

2565
02:36:00.830 --> 02:36:03.160
Also that bit from my,
uh,
act.
Totally true.

2566
02:36:03.340 --> 02:36:07.810
There's more tigers in Texas and private collections then all of the wild in the

2567
02:36:07.811 --> 02:36:11.740
world.
No frills.
Yeah.
That was the,
you ever see that bit that I used to do?
No.

2568
02:36:11.830 --> 02:36:15.940
Oh my God.
King's ranch,
911,215 acres.

2569
02:36:16.030 --> 02:36:19.660

2571

911,000 acres is fucking banana owns king ranch.

2572
02:36:28.690 --> 02:36:32.120
Some dude who just balling calls himself a king of King [inaudible] death.

2573
02:36:32.470 --> 02:36:34.330
That guy might as well have his own country.

2574
02:36:34.510 --> 02:36:38.080
He basically has like a small European country.
Timmy can stay there right now.

2575
02:36:38.200 --> 02:36:40.540
I bet that she has like the size of Rhode Island,
Bro.
First of all,

2576
02:36:40.570 --> 02:36:44.860
there's a king ranch for truck.
They have their own trucks.
Oh,

F One under the Hood America.

02:36:57.550 --> 02:37:01.510
Just a big old eagle.
Dick got back up there to the what?
What's,

2581
02:37:01.540 --> 02:37:05.590
what's the heavy bag?
Hold on.
Why does it have heavy bags?
The fuck is all that.

2582
02:37:06.500 --> 02:37:09.640
Check out the new innovations.
Go Click on the heavy bag.

2583
02:37:09.641 --> 02:37:13.870
Why does it have all the weights and shit?
What does that the fuck is going on?

2584
02:37:14.140 --> 02:37:18.920
I totally high strength military can do.
This is Denis Leary's voice.
Um,

2585
02:37:18.950 --> 02:37:22.070
go back to uh,
the uh,
kings ranch page again too.

2586
02:37:22.071 --> 02:37:23.660
I guess it's a hunting ranch too.
Yeah.

2587
02:37:23.661 --> 02:37:25.760
Click on the lower left or the left hand side.

2588
02:37:26.310 --> 02:37:29.060
They have mini golf that they probably have zebras.
Oh,
okay.

2589
02:37:29.510 --> 02:37:32.530
See those deer looking at those deer's antlers.
He,
that Shit,
you know,

2590
02:37:32.531 --> 02:37:37.250
that comes from,
can you go back?
No,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.

2591
02:37:37.251 --> 02:37:41.090
That's all selective breeding.
They take these farm deers,

2592
02:37:41.810 --> 02:37:46.790
so super 12 hold on.
12,000 Neil Guy.
That's crazy.

2593
02:37:46.850 --> 02:37:50.120
That's her African animals.
If 12,000 African antelope,

2594
02:37:50.330 --> 02:37:54.320
it's a big ass antelope too.
Um,
Pedis.
Turkey.
Yeah.

2595
02:37:54.321 --> 02:37:55.890
770,000 issues.

2596
02:37:55.900 --> 02:38:00.380
The fuck the Turkey premiere destination for Texas whitetail.
Those deer,

2597
02:38:00.381 --> 02:38:03.200
a lot of them would they do is they get them from a,

2598
02:38:03.201 --> 02:38:07.000
when you see crazy antlers with all sorts of goofy shit all over him,

2599
02:38:07.010 --> 02:38:11.600
not like normal antlers.
A lot of that is like selectively treat a lot,

2600
02:38:11.601 --> 02:38:15.860
but it's real.
But their pet deer,
they grow them in these high fence operations.

2601
02:38:15.861 --> 02:38:20.090
They feed them this insane concentration that has like a old leg,

2602
02:38:20.120 --> 02:38:24.200
like heavy duty do protein in it lacked PDDs.
Yeah.

2603
02:38:24.350 --> 02:38:28.400
And then they bring in certain bucks that have crazy genetic characteristics and

2604
02:38:28.401 --> 02:38:33.401
they breed them together like x men at any hunter that sees like crazy deer with

2605
02:38:33.711 --> 02:38:36.110
all sorts of bullshit all over the place.
They go,
oh,
okay,

2606
02:38:36.111 --> 02:38:38.530
you're shooting a farm dear.
Oh,
they don't want to fuck with it.
No,

2607
02:38:38.540 --> 02:38:40.670
because a lot of those times,
these animals,

2608
02:38:40.671 --> 02:38:44.780
they're getting shot and he's like tiny little farms.
They talking about like a,

2609
02:38:44.840 --> 02:38:48.050
you know,
a few acres and nothing has no idea,
has no idea.

2610
02:38:48.140 --> 02:38:49.800
Basically like exact kidding Kalb.

2611
02:38:49.801 --> 02:38:51.650
And most of these people shooting him with a gun too.

2612
02:38:51.830 --> 02:38:55.250
So they just like setting up shop waiting for that thing to walk in the right

2613
02:38:55.520 --> 02:38:56.840
thing and boom,
they blow it away.

2614
02:38:56.840 --> 02:38:59.780
It's more of a execution than isn't lot fucked up.

2615
02:38:59.870 --> 02:39:02.730
What else they get on that ranch?
I saw a crocodile,
Nah,

2616
02:39:02.810 --> 02:39:06.190
that have crocodiles like yeah,
come on.
They get out of crocodiles.

2617
02:39:06.200 --> 02:39:09.010
They have alligators,
saltwater CROC.

2618
02:39:09.840 --> 02:39:14.330
He had some shit with tin grads hunting.
Coolest place on earth.

2619
02:39:14.390 --> 02:39:18.630
I can't believe they have their own fucking truck.
Here's the ranch wildlife.

2620
02:39:18.710 --> 02:39:22.790
Click on that.
They're looking at that.
Look at that.
That's a crocodile.

2621
02:39:22.810 --> 02:39:26.000
That big crocodile I come from.
Is that an algorithm?
I think it's an alligator.

2622
02:39:26.240 --> 02:39:28.210
I don't think they have crocodiles and um,

2623
02:39:28.550 --> 02:39:31.010
they have North American crocodiles in Florida.

2624
02:39:31.011 --> 02:39:34.130
But I don't think they have them in Texas.
The king ranch,

2625
02:39:34.131 --> 02:39:37.040
so they can do whatever the fuck they want.
A King ranch,

2626
02:39:37.070 --> 02:39:41.300
saltwater fisherman would be the best place in Texas coast.

2627
02:39:41.330 --> 02:39:44.960
TROUSSEU speckled trout and red fish.
Red Fish are delicious.
What else?

2628
02:39:44.961 --> 02:39:49.790
They got Turkey.
Answer their calls.
Do Money got wrecked by the storm.

2629
02:39:49.791 --> 02:39:51.890
By the way,
they might not even be here anymore.
Oh fuck.

2630
02:39:51.891 --> 02:39:55.040
King ranch and are they in Houston?
There's somewhere on the water.

2631
02:39:55.041 --> 02:39:58.760
If they have a,
if they have ocean fishing,
they will.

2632
02:39:58.761 --> 02:40:02.240
They just built their own ocean and then they might have just dug a fucking,

2633
02:40:02.320 --> 02:40:06.680
when we're going to get us a compound going about 17 feet deep with the
concrete.

2634
02:40:07.170 --> 02:40:12.170
What we designed this motherfucker to be aerodynamics when then 400 mile an hour

2635
02:40:12.231 --> 02:40:13.380
winds coming.
Just glide.

2636
02:40:15.060 --> 02:40:15.211
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

2637
02:40:15.211 --> 02:40:20.211
they got hit with that or why don't you Google king ranch?

2638
02:40:20.671 --> 02:40:24.480
Hurricane damage.
Let's see if they're still around.
Dude,

2639
02:40:24.510 --> 02:40:27.990
we don't get an invitation from the king ranch.
Come on down.
Shoot some halls.

2640
02:40:27.991 --> 02:40:30.070
I balls.
Hey King ranch on my end,
but you,

2641
02:40:30.130 --> 02:40:33.220
we should have hog out of a helicopter with me.
Hotter percent.

2642
02:40:33.221 --> 02:40:37.740
It's 100% I would deal with Ted Nugent,
but Doug,
Stan hope will get mad at me.

2643
02:40:39.030 --> 02:40:43.200
Tim Kennedy wants us to deal with it now I'm in right now.

2644
02:40:43.290 --> 02:40:46.470
Nigga talking about American Dad.
I'll shit some to hog with.

2645
02:40:46.950 --> 02:40:51.150
And Tim Kennedy in a fucking helicopter.
Kiki,
Kiki,
Kiki.
And by the way,

2646
02:40:51.151 --> 02:40:54.900
they donate all that food and the wild hogs are fucking delicious too.

2647
02:40:55.230 --> 02:40:57.300
And they really do have to shoot them and the fucking thing,

2648
02:40:57.330 --> 02:41:01.830
there's so many of them.
Yeah,
that's the way Tim explained it to her to Oh fuck.

2649
02:41:02.610 --> 02:41:05.820
Uh,
through doing king.
So does it say anything about the damage?

2650
02:41:06.530 --> 02:41:08.910
I'm trying to find something that has specifically king ranch in it,

2651
02:41:08.911 --> 02:41:13.740
but it hit right near the beach.
Okay.
It's stated disaster.
Yeah,
he must,

2652
02:41:13.770 --> 02:41:17.520
they wants to got fun.
Might have some special protection program.

2653
02:41:17.521 --> 02:41:21.600
They're so fucking rich.
We're just,
these walls go up.
We set it up.

2654
02:41:21.601 --> 02:41:24.930
So you just press a button here in the whole building slides or underground,

2655
02:41:24.931 --> 02:41:29.430
right quick bio dome complete where the x men that their fucking jet comes out.

2656
02:41:31.340 --> 02:41:32.430
It's like a big circle.

2657
02:41:32.580 --> 02:41:37.580
It opens up back to this king ranch baby may being mad king ranch.

2658
02:41:37.860 --> 02:41:39.330
Do you think that's like a place where you could,

2659
02:41:39.360 --> 02:41:42.390
I think that's one of the few places that I could live outside of California

2660
02:41:42.391 --> 02:41:47.110
that it would be like super happy.
Texas,
Austin,
Austin,
Texas.
Anyway,

2661
02:41:47.111 --> 02:41:50.670
like Texas,
Dallas,
although it gets hot,
but I could definitely have been Austin.

2662
02:41:50.760 --> 02:41:55.380
Do you do shows there?
Uh,
did a show in Houston and Dallas.
Never.

2663
02:41:55.470 --> 02:41:58.900
I haven't been Austin yet.
Oh you got to do cap city comedy club.
I know.

2664
02:41:59.220 --> 02:42:03.210
It's the shit and I need to do.
It's amazing.
You'd love it.
I Love Austin.

2665
02:42:03.390 --> 02:42:07.780
The next level people to Austin's next level.
Crepe food too.
Fucking phenomenal.

2666
02:42:07.820 --> 02:42:11.370
But if you don't want a lobby takes you all over at the best Thai food in my

2667
02:42:11.371 --> 02:42:14.610
life in Austin.
Strong words.
I know,
right?

2668
02:42:14.611 --> 02:42:16.920
The best ever ever asked the Aubrey about it.

2669
02:42:16.921 --> 02:42:20.130
Just some good shit right over here on Ventura.
Really Love Thai food.

2670
02:42:20.960 --> 02:42:23.480
It's weird not wearing ties made it all the way.

2671
02:42:23.490 --> 02:42:24.750
I mean like I guess they're everywhere,

2672
02:42:24.751 --> 02:42:27.450
but like you go to like a lot of these Thai restaurants,

2673
02:42:27.480 --> 02:42:29.730
it's very rare that they're not ties working there.

2674
02:42:30.130 --> 02:42:32.710
If they have a white person has turned around and walked out.
Yeah.
Mexican,

2675
02:42:33.170 --> 02:42:37.770
Thai food.
I can't do I go to Sushi.
Has to white dude.
Fucking see you.
Yeah.

2676
02:42:37.860 --> 02:42:38.700
White dudes.

2677
02:42:39.420 --> 02:42:43.420
There's a lot of like white people getting into the Mexican food game and you

2678
02:42:43.421 --> 02:42:48.420
know you're gay.
I'm not mad at you and you can make some good Mexican food,

2679
02:42:48.421 --> 02:42:49.860
but better hide in the kitchen.

2680
02:42:49.980 --> 02:42:53.110
Keep up the solution and put the next one in front of me.

2681
02:42:53.430 --> 02:42:57.120
Come out with a big fake mustache.
She,
Hey,

2682
02:42:58.730 --> 02:43:00.550
hey Ho,
hey.

2683
02:43:01.860 --> 02:43:05.070
I want that shit to the police to have a lot of Mexicans working at it.

2684
02:43:05.160 --> 02:43:09.570
At least in Columbus.
When I was going there,
I switched and they were like,
well,

2685
02:43:09.600 --> 02:43:11.980
Mcdonald's bottom.
They fucked up and then they bought it back.

2686
02:43:11.980 --> 02:43:15.940
<v 0>Right?
Yeah.
How good is your pull everyone,
even though people are getting sick.</v>

2687
02:43:16.330 --> 02:43:19.400
Oh,
I heard it's delicious.
I haven't tried it.
Listen,
man,
cave me.

2688
02:43:19.520 --> 02:43:24.250
I get two orders of Guacamole and I'll get one of them.
Rice bowls,
please shake,

2689
02:43:24.251 --> 02:43:28.000
preach and I,
I'm eating fairly kido without eating all the rice.

2690
02:43:28.001 --> 02:43:32.440
If I just eat mostly the meat and the whackamole,
which is fantastic.
Quito there.

2691
02:43:32.441 --> 02:43:35.510
You get the heat of veggies for the bed and then you double me.

2692
02:43:35.530 --> 02:43:38.080
You do all the salsas.
Double Guacamole.

2693
02:43:40.030 --> 02:43:44.260
Delicious.
I feel good about it.
May two minutes.
Not Bad man.
For fast food,

2694
02:43:44.261 --> 02:43:47.890
it's about as good as you're going to get.
I agree.
Yeah.
Thai food,

2695
02:43:47.891 --> 02:43:50.820
they say to a certain point can be healthy too.
If it's like real tile,

2696
02:43:50.821 --> 02:43:54.940
like the needles and stuff.
Obviously not Kido,
but,
no,
not Quito,
but rice noodles,

2697
02:43:55.120 --> 02:43:58.520
man.
I'm I,
I'm struggling with Kido.
I'd drift in and out.
I mean,

2698
02:43:59.010 --> 02:44:02.710
pasta is just so strong.
I go back to it though.

2699
02:44:02.711 --> 02:44:06.720
You know the thing that knocks me back on course though is those are ketones,

2700
02:44:06.730 --> 02:44:09.850
man.
He Tajness ketones taking that key genic stuff.

2701
02:44:09.880 --> 02:44:11.710
That's the big one because it's so easy for me.

2702
02:44:11.711 --> 02:44:13.180
I take it when I work out in the morning,

2703
02:44:13.420 --> 02:44:15.890
I know I'll get before they do anything.
But you know,

2704
02:44:15.891 --> 02:44:18.670
you had homeboy like doctor keyed on your show.
He was saying,

2705
02:44:18.671 --> 02:44:21.820
really it's going to take about it.
Well how long is it a year?
18 months.

2706
02:44:21.821 --> 02:44:25.450
Some shit stinky.
Totally,
completely adapted and motherfucker,

2707
02:44:25.480 --> 02:44:29.500
it was discharging off the charts crazy though.
I mean with with ketones.
Crazy,

2708
02:44:30.010 --> 02:44:32.260
crazy,
smart,
crazy.
A lot of people disagreed with him.

2709
02:44:32.261 --> 02:44:35.890
I'd like to get those people on with them.
He was so small as to go performance.

2710
02:44:35.920 --> 02:44:36.970
Oh yeah.
And he was like,

2711
02:44:37.070 --> 02:44:39.840
he would like to stay in Quito and if you're trying to get on Ketone,

2712
02:44:39.900 --> 02:44:42.880
you listen to that podcast.
I'm a fuck are so discouraging.
He's like,

2713
02:44:42.881 --> 02:44:47.290
you need about 1218 months before anything happens.
And I was like,

2714
02:44:47.440 --> 02:44:51.160
uh,
you lose weight fast.
You date.
You know what?

2715
02:44:51.161 --> 02:44:55.270
The thing that gets me the most that I found was when my body became fat

2716
02:44:55.271 --> 02:44:56.680
adaptive,
right.
A switched over.

2717
02:44:56.681 --> 02:45:00.040
The thing that I could tell for sure was that my appetite was not crazy.

2718
02:45:00.041 --> 02:45:02.530
In the middle of the afternoon,
I don't have the ups and downs.
No ups and downs.

2719
02:45:02.980 --> 02:45:07.750
I went off and I'm doing pests.
10 I'm more carbs and I'm fucking starving.
Now.

2720
02:45:07.751 --> 02:45:12.280
Why pescatarian wife?
Just trying to just try it and mixing it up.

2721
02:45:12.281 --> 02:45:16.270
Like does it feel all right?
Just all right.
All right.

2722
02:45:16.360 --> 02:45:19.510
It gets a little challenging.
Like I ate so much salmon and tuna.

2723
02:45:19.760 --> 02:45:23.560
You gotta be careful with mercury levels and stuff too.
I know what the tune is.

2724
02:45:24.110 --> 02:45:27.640
Salmon not so much,
but you Leo,
Sardines,
oysters,
scallops.

2725
02:45:27.670 --> 02:45:29.590
It gets a little challenging.
A lot of salads.

2726
02:45:29.591 --> 02:45:33.040
How long have you been doing it now?
Two weeks.
Three weeks.

2727
02:45:33.090 --> 02:45:35.880
You're trying to get leaner like you just trying to try it out.
Uh,

2728
02:45:35.890 --> 02:45:39.880
just trying to get leaner and just mix it up.
Cause I know Quito works.
But again,

2729
02:45:40.630 --> 02:45:42.590
after listening to homeboy on the podcast like,
shit,

2730
02:45:42.600 --> 02:45:45.610
let's not like all the way in for 18 months.
Yeah.

2731
02:45:45.611 --> 02:45:48.460
Well I think he's talking about all the benefits.

2732
02:45:48.490 --> 02:45:52.270
You know he's talking about like this real serious metabolic benefits to be

2733
02:45:52.271 --> 02:45:54.940
gained from staying with it for long periods of time,

2734
02:45:54.941 --> 02:45:57.820
but I think that's probably the case.

2735
02:45:57.821 --> 02:46:02.230
But food is something else too.
There's a lot of pleasure with food.

2736
02:46:02.650 --> 02:46:04.720
You know,
like there's certain,

2737
02:46:04.750 --> 02:46:08.800
there's something to be said about enjoying life and I think you should eat
hell.

2738
02:46:09.050 --> 02:46:09.980
I follow what I call

2739
02:46:09.980 --> 02:46:14.810
<v 1>the 80 20 principle or 80% of the time I eat really good preach and then 20% of</v>

2740
02:46:14.811 --> 02:46:18.320
time I'll fuck off B two Monday through Friday.
I'm good man.

2741
02:46:18.350 --> 02:46:20.150
Then Sunday if I'm with my fam,

2742
02:46:20.210 --> 02:46:23.600
like we went to universal on Thursday at a bunch of chicken tenders.

2743
02:46:23.630 --> 02:46:27.690
I also work out like a fucking demon.
So everyday fat every day.

2744
02:46:28.370 --> 02:46:32.930
Stay fat.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But I thought just like a lasagna every now and then

2745
02:46:34.840 --> 02:46:37.280
the cheese and the meat and the,
Oh,

2746
02:46:37.281 --> 02:46:41.830
you don't have feeling when you take a big bite of fucking heavy sauce,
cheese,

2747
02:46:41.840 --> 02:46:45.530
Lasagna and you're like,
oh my mouth as well.
You know what fucks me up?

2748
02:46:46.130 --> 02:46:46.701
What gets me?

2749
02:46:46.701 --> 02:46:51.080
We were just talking shit about advertisements on dominoes went the last to

2750
02:46:51.090 --> 02:46:55.040
Metta hot dominoes pizza.
Domino's pizza they always have in the back.

2751
02:46:55.070 --> 02:46:58.100
If they can get it at a UFC,
actually they just get any kind of pizza.

2752
02:46:58.280 --> 02:47:01.640
But I've had Domino's before too.
It's not bad,
but this is the thing.

2753
02:47:01.670 --> 02:47:02.930
Here's the fat kid tip.

2754
02:47:02.960 --> 02:47:06.190
If you want to make sure you have a fresh pizza when you're ordering online

2755
02:47:06.260 --> 02:47:09.600
makes you ask for extra robust tomato sauce.
Cause they even,

2756
02:47:09.610 --> 02:47:13.190
I can't even an old one like God fuck this asshole that's for fresh sauce.

2757
02:47:13.250 --> 02:47:15.470
So they've put extra on it.
So it's a fresh pizza,

2758
02:47:15.530 --> 02:47:19.790
extra robust tomato sauce game over that pizza,

2759
02:47:20.360 --> 02:47:23.060
that fucking pizza man.
Dude,

2760
02:47:23.061 --> 02:47:27.490
there's a place in woodland hills to Nino's they shit in the mouth of dominoes

2761
02:47:27.580 --> 02:47:30.500
that you want your fucking American now's mouth.

2762
02:47:30.830 --> 02:47:34.150
You know the crocodiles and the crocodiles are biting cartoon characters.

2763
02:47:34.190 --> 02:47:38.720
No hope.
That's what they do.
Like splash,
rounded.
Just shit in the mouth.

2764
02:47:41.350 --> 02:47:44.240
We get a pizza.
Is it think crosser and crosser?

2765
02:47:44.320 --> 02:47:47.930
Think you're fucking writers are so good.
Oh I love the Domino's guy.

2766
02:47:48.610 --> 02:47:53.560
Wait noise.
Yeah.
He's not around anymore.
He's too fucking crazy.
The noise.

2767
02:47:54.040 --> 02:47:57.320
It looks like Charles Manson's girl with a job.
Why was he around?

2768
02:47:57.321 --> 02:47:59.840
What was the deal with the north?
They're trying to private market.

2769
02:47:59.841 --> 02:48:03.170
The kids back in the 80s and they brought out a game.

2770
02:48:03.171 --> 02:48:07.360
I had a stuffed annoyed when I was a seven up character to member.
Like spot.
Yes.

2771
02:48:07.580 --> 02:48:11.510
Doh and sugar.
I mean that's what it dough and sugar and cheese.

2772
02:48:11.660 --> 02:48:15.650
Don't give a fuck lot.
It is so delicious.

2773
02:48:16.040 --> 02:48:20.240
A fresh down those pizza.
Oh dear.
You know what's,

2774
02:48:20.300 --> 02:48:25.280
what's your favorite pizza combination?
I go again.
The extra robust tomato sauce,

2775
02:48:25.550 --> 02:48:29.660
cheese,
pepperoni,
Jalapenos,
tomatoes,

2776
02:48:30.560 --> 02:48:33.860
I think.
Oh and mushrooms.
I have three favorite college here.

2777
02:48:33.910 --> 02:48:38.030
My mouth is watering so bad.
Where do you get it from though?
Different pizza.

2778
02:48:38.240 --> 02:48:42.770
Pizza place just in general knows is really good.
Just in general.
Uh,

2779
02:48:42.920 --> 02:48:46.820
the classic for me is Pepperoni's with mushrooms.
I like it.
Get pepperoni,

2780
02:48:46.821 --> 02:48:50.480
mushroom to grow,
good pepperoni and mushrooms.
Some pizza.

2781
02:48:50.540 --> 02:48:53.600
I like a fucking flat cheese pizza.
Nothing.

2782
02:48:53.601 --> 02:48:57.710
He'll cheat God damn America and a nice cheese pizza,

2783
02:48:58.160 --> 02:49:01.640
but I can't have a dog.
I need some salts.
I get some sauce.

2784
02:49:01.670 --> 02:49:06.630
Here's where I deviate.
Double Pineapple,
double anchovy.
Oh,

2785
02:49:06.710 --> 02:49:07.990
you lost in the anchovy by

2786
02:49:08.010 --> 02:49:09.300
<v 0>fucks with the pineapple.</v>

2787
02:49:09.420 --> 02:49:13.950
Pineapple and anchovy pizza is fucking sweet and salt.

2788
02:49:13.951 --> 02:49:18.000
Sweet and salty with the cheese.
The sauce is oozing.

2789
02:49:18.200 --> 02:49:22.530
Oh Dude.
Double I.
I'd have to get them to like read it back to me.
They're like,

2790
02:49:22.531 --> 02:49:26.100
you sure you want,
are you trying to shit your pants to say double pineapple?

2791
02:49:26.220 --> 02:49:30.750
Double anchovy.
I'm like,
motherfucker.
I said exactly what I said,

2792
02:49:31.020 --> 02:49:34.300
avalanche or we don't want four diet cokes.
Yes,

2793
02:49:34.680 --> 02:49:37.650
it's so unhealthy but so robbed.
Damn good.

2794
02:49:37.740 --> 02:49:39.450
But if you're watching a movie or something like that,

2795
02:49:39.451 --> 02:49:41.490
like guardians of the galaxy two or something like that,

2796
02:49:41.840 --> 02:49:44.210
you get a double pineapple or you're looking at that,

2797
02:49:44.380 --> 02:49:48.740
that motherfucker right there.
That's deep dish.

2798
02:49:48.880 --> 02:49:52.890
Then that's a your deep dish.
Yeah.
It's more of a casserole.

2799
02:49:53.220 --> 02:49:57.900
I don't think that's deep dish.
It looks deep from my angle.
Double Pineapple.

2800
02:49:58.080 --> 02:50:00.330
Double anchovy.
Yeah.
That's a casserole.

2801
02:50:03.180 --> 02:50:07.710
Fuck.
That knows I like a nice Margarita pizza to Margarita Pizza,

2802
02:50:08.100 --> 02:50:11.510
dude.
I had pizza in Italy.
First of all,
fill level.
They'll,

2803
02:50:11.540 --> 02:50:15.960
the bread is different.
They have heirloom wheat,
they're wheat is older wheat.

2804
02:50:16.170 --> 02:50:16.830
It's wheat,

2805
02:50:16.830 --> 02:50:20.520
like are we used to be before we started fucking with it to make it more durable

2806
02:50:20.910 --> 02:50:25.380
to make it survive pesticides to make it last longer and to give more yield.

2807
02:50:25.440 --> 02:50:29.730
Like if you have an acre of land and you grow this heirloom wheat,

2808
02:50:29.760 --> 02:50:31.860
you will have a,
uh,
smaller yield.

2809
02:50:31.920 --> 02:50:34.830
Then you have an acre of our new better quality.
Yeah.

2810
02:50:34.831 --> 02:50:35.790
It's sort of like the same thing.

2811
02:50:35.791 --> 02:50:39.360
Like can you see tomatoes in the store and they're big and they're fucking Pale

2812
02:50:39.361 --> 02:50:42.720
as shit and they can throw a pleasant to pay the bounce.
Yeah,
they bounce.

2813
02:50:42.960 --> 02:50:44.670
Whereas you get an heirloom tomato,

2814
02:50:44.700 --> 02:50:47.400
they're only good for like a couple of days and then they start to rot.

2815
02:50:47.640 --> 02:50:50.550
But when you catch them in their fresh God,
they're like a fruit.

2816
02:50:50.580 --> 02:50:54.660
They're delicious,
they're fantastic.
So it was the best pizza ever.
Phenomenal.

2817
02:50:54.990 --> 02:50:58.560
Phenomenal Pizza.
Phenomenal Pasta.
And you can buy the pasta.

2818
02:50:58.890 --> 02:51:02.700
So the thing is like their pasta is available in the United States.

2819
02:51:02.701 --> 02:51:07.320
You've got to order it from like amazon.com but I think it's called double o

2820
02:51:07.560 --> 02:51:12.280
pasta or double o wheat.
Double or double zero and it's,

2821
02:51:13.350 --> 02:51:17.070
yes,
it's from Italy and you bought it tastes different while you're eating it.

2822
02:51:17.100 --> 02:51:21.810
It goes down easier.
Make Tortellini.
Yeah,
they make everything out of my mouth.

2823
02:51:21.811 --> 02:51:25.530
Is full flood is maybe somebody here.
Oh it could be.

2824
02:51:25.950 --> 02:51:30.570
Well a lot of people use zero in terms of,
I mean cine Alfredo,
I don't,

2825
02:51:30.660 --> 02:51:31.860
I don't fuck with that stuff.
I like,

2826
02:51:31.890 --> 02:51:34.590
I like red sauce and I'm not a white sauce guy.

2827
02:51:35.010 --> 02:51:36.240
I think it's like white people food.

2828
02:51:36.241 --> 02:51:41.241
It's like mayonnaise double zero double zero pasta typically milled in Italy

2829
02:51:41.551 --> 02:51:45.450
where a Miller's grade their flour using a zero rating,
a single zero flowers,

2830
02:51:45.451 --> 02:51:50.451
quite coarse in texture like a Powderly seminoma whereas triple zero is much

2831
02:51:50.641 --> 02:51:54.960
finer like cornstarch,
but everyday flower is usually classified as double zero.

2832
02:51:55.530 --> 02:51:58.230
Double Zero Spaghetti is the shit to,

2833
02:51:58.231 --> 02:52:02.350
it was so good man that but just this one company that had bought it for it got

2834
02:52:02.360 --> 02:52:06.040
damaged.
You make it at home.
Yes.
Your wife makes it.
I make

2835
02:52:06.040 --> 02:52:09.040
<v 1>it to a cook.
I know how to cook,
Bro.
I can boil water board.</v>

2836
02:52:09.430 --> 02:52:13.420
But then what kind of red sauce are you using?
Um,
I use uncle Steve's,

2837
02:52:14.460 --> 02:52:18.640
uh,
up on him.
I don't know the agent zero or uncle Steve's.
She,
yeah.

2838
02:52:19.420 --> 02:52:22.270
Uh,
hold on a second.
I'll find out right now.

2839
02:52:22.410 --> 02:52:26.800
But a mouth is watering like a motherfucking Arthur.
Hmm.
I tell you what,

2840
02:52:26.801 --> 02:52:30.880
everyone says New York Pizza.
Chicago pizza,
La Pizza Juice Sta.

2841
02:52:31.300 --> 02:52:35.080
Or you get a Gelina takeaway pizza.
Some of the best in the world.

2842
02:52:35.110 --> 02:52:39.600
Abot Kenny Pizza.
Abbott Pizza.
I've been looking for good pizza.

2843
02:52:39.650 --> 02:52:43.570
Looking for good pizza.
I'm in the middle.
Not,
I'm not on the west side,
so bro,

2844
02:52:43.990 --> 02:52:46.510
well,
I don't know around here,
but Hollywood area.

2845
02:52:46.940 --> 02:52:50.920
I don't know pizza down there that Joey Diaz does.
He's telling me someplace,

2846
02:52:51.250 --> 02:52:54.250
but uh,
I'm telling you man,
juice does.

2847
02:52:54.251 --> 02:52:58.810
Pizza came chip this Margarita Pizza.
Knock your Dick in the dope.
Really?

2848
02:52:59.020 --> 02:53:03.940
Yes.
Where's that?
That's a write off gold's gym there in Venice.
Right,

2849
02:53:03.941 --> 02:53:08.140
right,
right off rose Kinda.
It's like a,
it's like almost like a deli atmosphere.

2850
02:53:08.290 --> 02:53:13.060
Shit is delicious.
Damn Dude,
I know my pizza.

2851
02:53:13.200 --> 02:53:16.180
I just,
you just made me so hungry,
man.
My friend Steve [inaudible],

2852
02:53:16.510 --> 02:53:19.420
he's been on the podcast before.
He's the one that owns uncle Steve's.

2853
02:53:19.421 --> 02:53:23.560
It's all organic.
Um,
him and his wife created it and make it themselves.

2854
02:53:24.460 --> 02:53:27.130
It's best pasta sauce I've ever had,
but they have a,

2855
02:53:27.131 --> 02:53:30.820
a spicy pasta like Aria Bhakta who I like it spicy.
You got,

2856
02:53:30.821 --> 02:53:34.020
you gotta be careful with.
They're spicy.
They're spicy.
They are not fun.

2857
02:53:34.021 --> 02:53:38.400
It's like real talents by,
it's got a kick to it.
Like Woo.
I think if you like it,

2858
02:53:38.401 --> 02:53:41.620
spicy sauce.
I love it.
Me Too.
It's got a kick butt.
It's all organic.

2859
02:53:41.620 --> 02:53:44.530
Super healthy and really good.
Delicious.
How hard is it?
Ticket?

2860
02:53:44.610 --> 02:53:49.000
I was exhausted and get,
or is it easy?
No,
he brought me in a gang of it.

2861
02:53:49.001 --> 02:53:52.060
He gave me like two cases of it,
but I think you buy it online.

2862
02:53:52.150 --> 02:53:55.070
You're just making your own pizza at home.
Fucking nightmare.
The content.

2863
02:53:55.230 --> 02:53:57.820
No fucking nightmare.
It tastes like shit too.
I was like,

2864
02:53:57.821 --> 02:53:59.940
when I see people get a pizza oven in their backyard,
I'm like,

2865
02:53:59.980 --> 02:54:03.670
that's something you're going to use three times complete waste of time ever

2866
02:54:03.700 --> 02:54:06.940
complete waste of time when you see someone doesn't work out.
Well,

2867
02:54:06.941 --> 02:54:10.650
I figured if I buy this treadmill,
no,
no,
bitch,
you're not.
I can use that.

2868
02:54:11.230 --> 02:54:14.470
It's not the equipment.
It's your attitude.
It's a baker,
bro.
No,

2869
02:54:14.471 --> 02:54:16.840
you're not pizza man.
Chef Boyardee Anya,

2870
02:54:18.820 --> 02:54:22.200
let's wrap this up.
Let's,
can we get some fucking pizza and pizza?
All right.

2871
02:54:22.630 --> 02:54:24.070
See You folks.
Bye.

2872
02:54:27.130 --> 02:54:27.700
<v 11>Pizza,
Bro.</v>
