<v Speaker 1>I'm so good.</v>

10
00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:16.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm very excited about your fight man.</v>

11
00:00:16.131 --> 00:00:16.964
<v Speaker 1>Very excited.</v>

12
00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:18.280
<v Speaker 1>Not as excited as I am.</v>

13
00:00:18.281 --> 00:00:19.114
<v Speaker 1>Not to be.</v>

14
00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:20.120
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure.</v>

15
00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.420
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

16
00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.270
<v Speaker 1>how often does it that two undefeated,</v>

17
00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.360
<v Speaker 1>I mean you're not heavyweight champion cause they stripped you but you never</v>

18
00:00:26.361 --> 00:00:28.700
<v Speaker 1>lost to undefeated heavyweight champions.</v>

19
00:00:28.701 --> 00:00:29.481
<v Speaker 1>Go at it like this.</v>

20
00:00:29.481 --> 00:00:30.650
<v Speaker 1>This is a huge fight.</v>

21
00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:31.551
<v Speaker 2>Very much so.</v>

22
00:00:31.551 --> 00:00:33.410
<v Speaker 2>It's never ever happened before ever.</v>

23
00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:34.573
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty exciting.</v>

24
00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:35.990
<v Speaker 2>Someone to as big as us.</v>

25
00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.580
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

26
00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:38.240
<v Speaker 2>I've never ever fought each other.</v>

27
00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:43.180
<v Speaker 1>What do you think of it mean for people who don't know you're fighting Deontay</v>

28
00:00:43.181 --> 00:00:44.230
<v Speaker 1>wilder who's a,</v>

29
00:00:44.231 --> 00:00:49.231
<v Speaker 1>an American undefeated knockout artists and you are probably one of the more</v>

30
00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:51.280
<v Speaker 1>interesting guys in the heavyweight division.</v>

31
00:00:51.281 --> 00:00:52.870
<v Speaker 1>Not just cause your personality,</v>

32
00:00:52.871 --> 00:00:53.920
<v Speaker 1>but your skill set,</v>

33
00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.420
<v Speaker 1>the way you move your long and tall.</v>

34
00:00:56.421 --> 00:00:58.450
<v Speaker 1>But you've got great footwork and your fast,</v>

35
00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.931
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

36
00:00:58.931 --> 00:00:59.531
<v Speaker 1>it's a very,</v>

37
00:00:59.531 --> 00:01:00.610
<v Speaker 1>very interesting fight.</v>

38
00:01:00.611 --> 00:01:02.530
<v Speaker 1>As far as like boxing technique.</v>

39
00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:04.360
<v Speaker 2>It's power,</v>

40
00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.700
<v Speaker 2>raw power versus boxing skill.</v>

41
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:08.171
<v Speaker 2>Two guys.</v>

42
00:01:08.171 --> 00:01:09.070
<v Speaker 2>One six foot nine,</v>

43
00:01:09.071 --> 00:01:10.090
<v Speaker 2>one six foot seven.</v>

44
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:12.480
<v Speaker 2>Both charismatic,</v>

45
00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:13.540
<v Speaker 2>both talkers,</v>

46
00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:14.501
<v Speaker 2>one British,</v>

47
00:01:14.501 --> 00:01:15.161
<v Speaker 2>one American.</v>

48
00:01:15.161 --> 00:01:16.540
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't get any bigger than necessities.</v>

49
00:01:16.541 --> 00:01:19.780
<v Speaker 2>The biggest flight that could be made of this time in heavyweight division or in</v>

50
00:01:19.781 --> 00:01:20.614
<v Speaker 2>the world of boxing</v>

51
00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.140
<v Speaker 1>when you watched Deontay wilder move around,</v>

52
00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:24.910
<v Speaker 1>there's nobody that moves like that guy.</v>

53
00:01:24.911 --> 00:01:25.900
<v Speaker 1>So odd.</v>

54
00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.900
<v Speaker 1>Like it reminds me of Bambi on ice.</v>

55
00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.590
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't really find his legs underneath him now.</v>

56
00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.500
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes he throws and he's got no legs underneath them.</v>

57
00:01:35.501 --> 00:01:36.130
<v Speaker 1>These just,</v>

58
00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.460
<v Speaker 1>he's swinging and literally he's flying through the air as he's punching.</v>

59
00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.520
<v Speaker 2>I've seen him fall over a few times as well.</v>

60
00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:42.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

61
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:42.271
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>

62
00:01:42.271 --> 00:01:45.360
<v Speaker 2>the guy tries to lung that big punch and when you're trying to knock people out</v>

63
00:01:45.361 --> 00:01:46.470
<v Speaker 2>with every single punch,</v>

64
00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.820
<v Speaker 2>then if you miss it becomes a problem when you go off balance and maybe follow</v>

65
00:01:49.821 --> 00:01:50.550
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

66
00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:51.383
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

67
00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:52.201
<v Speaker 2>Will you uh,</v>

68
00:01:52.201 --> 00:01:53.640
<v Speaker 2>impressed with him and Louis Ortiz?</v>

69
00:01:53.641 --> 00:01:54.474
<v Speaker 2>Fine.</v>

70
00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.490
<v Speaker 2>I was impressed with him because he came back,</v>

71
00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.200
<v Speaker 2>he was losing all around.</v>

72
00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:01.340
<v Speaker 2>I only gave wilder the round,</v>

73
00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.791
<v Speaker 2>slightly knocked,</v>

74
00:02:01.791 --> 00:02:02.740
<v Speaker 2>taught he's down in.</v>

75
00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:04.090
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

76
00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.661
<v Speaker 2>so he done well.</v>

77
00:02:04.661 --> 00:02:05.860
<v Speaker 2>It was his acid test,</v>

78
00:02:05.861 --> 00:02:06.694
<v Speaker 2>so to say,</v>

79
00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.150
<v Speaker 2>come through all teases 49 years old.</v>

80
00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.550
<v Speaker 2>I'm all beat,</v>

81
00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:12.251
<v Speaker 2>at least.</v>

82
00:02:12.251 --> 00:02:15.550
<v Speaker 2>Albie was pasties past his prime age,</v>

83
00:02:15.551 --> 00:02:18.820
<v Speaker 2>but still undefeated champion coming in.</v>

84
00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.070
<v Speaker 2>So it was a great victory for Deontae world.</v>

85
00:02:21.071 --> 00:02:22.990
<v Speaker 2>And he proved to me that he can get combat,</v>

86
00:02:22.991 --> 00:02:24.580
<v Speaker 2>get her to come back and win if I</v>

87
00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.871
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

88
00:02:24.871 --> 00:02:26.580
<v Speaker 1>An rts comes from that Cuban system.</v>

89
00:02:26.581 --> 00:02:28.170
<v Speaker 1>He's got great skills.</v>

90
00:02:28.171 --> 00:02:28.340
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

91
00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.530
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

92
00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.710
<v Speaker 1>And he's looked fantastic and every single fight other than that fight up until</v>

93
00:02:31.711 --> 00:02:32.700
<v Speaker 1>that moment that he got hit.</v>

94
00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.381
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

95
00:02:33.381 --> 00:02:33.740
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

96
00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.330
<v Speaker 2>you can't go swim in and not get wet or teas.</v>

97
00:02:36.331 --> 00:02:37.940
<v Speaker 2>I don't have a 300 amateur fights,</v>

98
00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:39.530
<v Speaker 2>20 odd professional fights,</v>

99
00:02:39.531 --> 00:02:40.341
<v Speaker 2>nearly knocked Tamale Mall.</v>

100
00:02:40.341 --> 00:02:41.750
<v Speaker 2>I bought,</v>

101
00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.150
<v Speaker 2>if I may be critical of Louis Ortiz at us minute,</v>

102
00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:46.910
<v Speaker 2>he stood in front of Deontay,</v>

103
00:02:46.911 --> 00:02:48.440
<v Speaker 2>Walder right and punching range,</v>

104
00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.250
<v Speaker 2>which is not a wise decision considering the guys at 39 chaos.</v>

105
00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:54.680
<v Speaker 2>He's movement.</v>

106
00:02:54.681 --> 00:02:55.940
<v Speaker 2>He was trying to move a little bit,</v>

107
00:02:55.941 --> 00:02:57.380
<v Speaker 2>but he was on old legs.</v>

108
00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:58.610
<v Speaker 2>And I know a story.</v>

109
00:02:58.611 --> 00:02:59.860
<v Speaker 2>What happened before that fight?</v>

110
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.320
<v Speaker 2>Louis Ortiz had very bad blood pressure.</v>

111
00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:03.020
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

112
00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.790
<v Speaker 2>doctor was gonna pull him out and he had Charles Martin on standby,</v>

113
00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.521
<v Speaker 2>but he said,</v>

114
00:03:06.521 --> 00:03:06.761
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

115
00:03:06.761 --> 00:03:07.594
<v Speaker 2>I need the money.</v>

116
00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.960
<v Speaker 2>So we went in a fort anyway and he still nearly beat wilder.</v>

117
00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.680
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

118
00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:12.790
<v Speaker 2>High blood pressure.</v>

119
00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:15.001
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>

120
00:03:15.001 --> 00:03:16.130
<v Speaker 1>And where and where are you hearing this from?</v>

121
00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:17.203
<v Speaker 1>Good sources.</v>

122
00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:18.163
<v Speaker 1>Good source.</v>

123
00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:18.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

124
00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.890
<v Speaker 1>those are the best source is always the best inside info.</v>

125
00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:23.720
<v Speaker 1>You're an interesting story man,</v>

126
00:03:23.721 --> 00:03:25.730
<v Speaker 1>because not just because your personality,</v>

127
00:03:25.731 --> 00:03:26.750
<v Speaker 1>but because you're,</v>

128
00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.050
<v Speaker 1>you've come back from mental illness and you very,</v>

129
00:03:30.051 --> 00:03:31.070
<v Speaker 1>very open about it.</v>

130
00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.411
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

131
00:03:31.411 --> 00:03:31.640
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

132
00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:32.473
<v Speaker 1>I think that's,</v>

133
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.350
<v Speaker 1>that's a very unique thing where I'm,</v>

134
00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:35.420
<v Speaker 1>I remember when you,</v>

135
00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:40.570
<v Speaker 1>when you beat Klitschko and won the title and then you kind of went off the</v>

136
00:03:41.121 --> 00:03:43.730
<v Speaker 1>rails and I thought you were just partying.</v>

137
00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.451
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

138
00:03:44.451 --> 00:03:44.720
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

139
00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.520
<v Speaker 1>when I heard about it I thought wow,</v>

140
00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.910
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

141
00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:47.990
<v Speaker 1>I made a shit load of money,</v>

142
00:03:47.991 --> 00:03:49.220
<v Speaker 1>became the heavyweight champion.</v>

143
00:03:49.221 --> 00:03:51.380
<v Speaker 1>All the pressure and the press and all the craziness.</v>

144
00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:52.640
<v Speaker 1>But it was more than that.</v>

145
00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.980
<v Speaker 2>It was more than that.</v>

146
00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:59.240
<v Speaker 2>It started off like I'll suffered with mental health problems my whole life,</v>

147
00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:00.470
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't know what it was.</v>

148
00:04:00.471 --> 00:04:02.210
<v Speaker 2>Cause I never had no education on the mater.</v>

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:03.420

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:20.241
<v Speaker 2>our wife,</v>

164
00:04:20.241 --> 00:04:20.841
<v Speaker 2>our family,</v>

165
00:04:20.841 --> 00:04:21.201
<v Speaker 2>kids,</v>

166
00:04:21.201 --> 00:04:22.034
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

167
00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:23.930
<v Speaker 2>But I felt as if I had nothing.</v>

168
00:04:23.931 --> 00:04:28.931
<v Speaker 2>I felt there was an empty gaping hole that was just filled with gloom and doom.</v>

169
00:04:29.421 --> 00:04:29.901
<v Speaker 2>And I just was,</v>

170
00:04:29.901 --> 00:04:31.460
<v Speaker 2>one bad thing happened to me after another,</v>

171
00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:32.810
<v Speaker 2>within seven days,</v>

172
00:04:32.811 --> 00:04:36.550
<v Speaker 2>the IBF strip me of that title because I couldn't defend against gloves.</v>

173
00:04:36.551 --> 00:04:36.831
<v Speaker 2>Golf.</v>

174
00:04:36.831 --> 00:04:41.831
<v Speaker 2>He was a nobody because allery much closer volodymyr but the IBF wasn't expected</v>

175
00:04:42.021 --> 00:04:43.400
<v Speaker 2>me to beat Vladimir.</v>

176
00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:45.440
<v Speaker 2>So they took that clause in air anyway,</v>

177
00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.950
<v Speaker 2>thinking bloody me is going to announce to defend against class coffee because I</v>

178
00:04:48.951 --> 00:04:49.784
<v Speaker 2>won.</v>

179
00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.570
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

180
00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:51.470
<v Speaker 2>they stripped me of the belt,</v>

181
00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:52.490
<v Speaker 2>which none of my reason</v>

182
00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:54.240
<v Speaker 1>within seven days of the fight.</v>

183
00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

184
00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:55.583
<v Speaker 1>that's insane.</v>

185
00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.740
<v Speaker 1>How can they require you to fight</v>

186
00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:58.641
<v Speaker 2>within seven days?</v>

187
00:04:58.641 --> 00:04:59.271
<v Speaker 2>They didn't vote.</v>

188
00:04:59.271 --> 00:05:02.000
<v Speaker 2>They required me to go into negotiations.</v>

189
00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.040
<v Speaker 1>So just not going into negotiations to sign these strip you within seven days.</v>

190
00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

191
00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.120
<v Speaker 2>Well they knew I couldn't go into negotiations because already much close</v>

192
00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:11.510
<v Speaker 2>boxing's a dirty bus.</v>

193
00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:13.730
<v Speaker 2>So I was stuck in between a rock and a hard place.</v>

194
00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:14.573
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

195
00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:15.621
<v Speaker 2>And that's what happened.</v>

196
00:05:15.621 --> 00:05:16.401
<v Speaker 2>That was one belt.</v>

197
00:05:16.401 --> 00:05:17.190
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

198
00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:22.190
<v Speaker 2>I'll learn my team and the coach coach team or carrying on about where the</v>

199
00:05:22.581 --> 00:05:23.450
<v Speaker 2>flight was going to be.</v>

200
00:05:23.451 --> 00:05:25.370
<v Speaker 2>It was going to be on a cruise ship in Dubai.</v>

201
00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:26.541
<v Speaker 2>It was going to be here.</v>

202
00:05:26.541 --> 00:05:27.374
<v Speaker 2>It was going to be there.</v>

203
00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.840
<v Speaker 2>Time was dragging on a cruise ship.</v>

204
00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:30.441
<v Speaker 2>A cruise ship.</v>

205
00:05:30.441 --> 00:05:30.591
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

206
00:05:30.591 --> 00:05:34.820
<v Speaker 2>There was some Arab billionaire who wanted to make this fight in exclusive fight</v>

207
00:05:34.821 --> 00:05:35.870
<v Speaker 2>for him and his buddies.</v>

208
00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:36.580
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

209
00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:37.413
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

210
00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:38.390
<v Speaker 2>come on.</v>

211
00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:39.223
<v Speaker 2>Seriously.</v>

212
00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:41.510
<v Speaker 2>This fight was heading for a cruise ship.</v>

213
00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:43.520
<v Speaker 2>That fucking oil money,</v>

214
00:05:43.521 --> 00:05:44.180
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

215
00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:46.430
<v Speaker 2>they got some money and if they can afford it,</v>

216
00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:46.971
<v Speaker 2>do it.</v>

217
00:05:46.971 --> 00:05:47.740
<v Speaker 2>That's what I say.</v>

218
00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:51.700
<v Speaker 1>That would have been the most hilarious scenario ever for a world heavyweight</v>

219
00:05:51.701 --> 00:05:55.630
<v Speaker 1>title fight a bunch of Arab billionaires on a cruise ship.</v>

220
00:05:58.940 --> 00:05:59.773
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

221
00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:01.760
<v Speaker 2>So the strip you of the IBF belt,</v>

222
00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:04.160
<v Speaker 2>you go into negotiation with Klitschko for the rematch.</v>

223
00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:05.460
<v Speaker 2>How in the rematch never happened.</v>

224
00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:06.051
<v Speaker 2>Very much.</v>

225
00:06:06.051 --> 00:06:09.500
<v Speaker 2>Didn't happen initially because I went over on my uncle in training.</v>

226
00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:10.750
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

227
00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:13.470
<v Speaker 2>I was in Holland training folder.</v>

228
00:06:13.471 --> 00:06:14.960
<v Speaker 2>He much on,</v>

229
00:06:14.961 --> 00:06:17.870
<v Speaker 2>I was running up on the heavy terrain and I went over from ankle sprain my ankle</v>

230
00:06:17.871 --> 00:06:18.411
<v Speaker 2>quite badly.</v>

231
00:06:18.411 --> 00:06:19.700
<v Speaker 2>So we had to postpone the folly.</v>

232
00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:20.840
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

233
00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:24.550
<v Speaker 2>but that time I was off like say three months getting his uncle right and all</v>

234
00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:25.393
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

235
00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:26.390
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

236
00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:27.510
<v Speaker 2>I just didn't want to do any,</v>

237
00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:28.373
<v Speaker 2>if you know what I mean.</v>

238
00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:29.510
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have the desire.</v>

239
00:06:29.511 --> 00:06:33.530
<v Speaker 2>The fire wasn't burning no longer to fight and I was suffering with depression</v>

240
00:06:33.531 --> 00:06:34.041
<v Speaker 2>the whole time.</v>

241
00:06:34.041 --> 00:06:34.910
<v Speaker 2>Even in training camp,</v>

242
00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:36.380
<v Speaker 2>before I sprained my ankle,</v>

243
00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:38.060
<v Speaker 2>I was depressed as depressed,</v>

244
00:06:38.061 --> 00:06:39.530
<v Speaker 2>could be on a daily basis.</v>

245
00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:40.360
<v Speaker 2>I don't think,</v>

246
00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:41.330
<v Speaker 2>why am I feeling like this?</v>

247
00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:42.800
<v Speaker 2>I don't have no reason to fail like it.</v>

248
00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:44.270
<v Speaker 2>Some people will say,</v>

249
00:06:44.271 --> 00:06:46.130
<v Speaker 2>oh well each attention seeking or whatever,</v>

250
00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:48.740
<v Speaker 2>but unless you've experienced what I'm saying,</v>

251
00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:52.880
<v Speaker 2>it's still of impossible to understand where it had been aware of come from.</v>

252
00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:55.460
<v Speaker 2>And it just went from bad to worse.</v>

253
00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:56.870
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

254
00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:59.450
<v Speaker 2>I hate the drink heavily on a daily basis.</v>

255
00:06:59.451 --> 00:07:00.470
<v Speaker 2>I hit the drugs.</v>

256
00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:01.850
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

257
00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:06.410
<v Speaker 2>I was out all night party team of women of the night and not coming home.</v>

258
00:07:06.411 --> 00:07:07.244
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

259
00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:08.600
<v Speaker 2>I didn't care about boxing.</v>

260
00:07:08.601 --> 00:07:09.620
<v Speaker 2>I didn't care about living it,</v>

261
00:07:09.621 --> 00:07:12.500
<v Speaker 2>just wanting to die and I was going to have a good time doing it while I was</v>

262
00:07:12.501 --> 00:07:13.334
<v Speaker 2>doing it.</v>

263
00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:17.390
<v Speaker 2>I used to drink and take drugs to get away from their depression because when I</v>

264
00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:18.410
<v Speaker 2>was drunk or high,</v>

265
00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:19.581
<v Speaker 2>then I wouldn't,</v>

266
00:07:19.581 --> 00:07:19.831
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

267
00:07:19.831 --> 00:07:23.770
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't think about being depressed for fall about being a boxing champion or</v>

268
00:07:23.771 --> 00:07:23.880
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

269
00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:24.770
<v Speaker 2>I feel great.</v>

270
00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:27.590
<v Speaker 2>But as we know when the drink was off,</v>

271
00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:31.820
<v Speaker 2>he only leaves you with a bad hangover and failing even more depressed.</v>

272
00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:33.890
<v Speaker 2>But someone who suffers with mental health,</v>

273
00:07:33.891 --> 00:07:36.770
<v Speaker 2>the worst thing we can do to escape it is take drugs or alcohol.</v>

274
00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:37.941
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

275
00:07:37.941 --> 00:07:39.080
<v Speaker 2>that's the most common approach.</v>

276
00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:43.220
<v Speaker 2>And that's the common approach because people we don't know cause it's not spoke</v>

277
00:07:43.221 --> 00:07:43.970
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

278
00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:48.110
<v Speaker 2>And this is why I want to spread the word on mental health.</v>

279
00:07:48.111 --> 00:07:51.290
<v Speaker 2>So when other people are in this position in the future,</v>

280
00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:54.410
<v Speaker 2>they know where to go and they know what to do because there's a blueprint.</v>

281
00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:55.551
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

282
00:07:55.551 --> 00:08:00.551
<v Speaker 1>Kudos to you for doing that because so so few people have the courage to talk</v>

283
00:08:01.131 --> 00:08:03.470
<v Speaker 1>about their struggles when they go through that because it seems like a</v>

284
00:08:03.471 --> 00:08:04.160
<v Speaker 1>weakness.</v>

285
00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:04.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

286
00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:04.850
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

287
00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:05.061
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

288
00:08:05.061 --> 00:08:09.080
<v Speaker 1>it's very powerful that you were willing to do that and just be open and honest</v>

289
00:08:09.081 --> 00:08:09.470
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

290
00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:11.630
<v Speaker 1>There's a few people out there that are doing that now.</v>

291
00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:11.991
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

292
00:08:11.991 --> 00:08:13.340
<v Speaker 1>our friend moral Rinaldo,</v>

293
00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:17.600
<v Speaker 1>he's gone through some some serious mental health issues and he's very open</v>

294
00:08:17.601 --> 00:08:20.030
<v Speaker 1>about it and talks about it quite a bit now.</v>

295
00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:24.890
<v Speaker 1>When you were training for the first Klitschko fight for the fight rather,</v>

296
00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:26.450
<v Speaker 1>did you have it then?</v>

297
00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:28.311
<v Speaker 2>Not really,</v>

298
00:08:28.311 --> 00:08:28.750
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

299
00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:33.750
<v Speaker 2>I was set focused on what I wanted to do and that was beat Vladimir Klitschko.</v>

300
00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:39.490
<v Speaker 2>I believe when you've got a goal in mind or from being a child all your life and</v>

301
00:08:40.071 --> 00:08:40.820
<v Speaker 2>you do that,</v>

302
00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:43.100
<v Speaker 2>then I was like obviously lost.</v>

303
00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:46.220
<v Speaker 2>I was almost like I didn't have anything more to do in my life,</v>

304
00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:47.680
<v Speaker 2>although I could a carried on on,</v>

305
00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:48.471
<v Speaker 2>defended the belt,</v>

306
00:08:48.471 --> 00:08:49.304
<v Speaker 2>some whatever.</v>

307
00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:51.950
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't really interested in doing that I'd beat them on.</v>

308
00:08:51.951 --> 00:08:54.770
<v Speaker 2>I'd always wanted to do because when I was an amateur boxer,</v>

309
00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:58.710
<v Speaker 2>I used to watch flood in mayor Klitschko on TV as a world heavyweight champion.</v>

310
00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:00.720
<v Speaker 2>And I always aimed,</v>

311
00:09:00.721 --> 00:09:02.580
<v Speaker 2>he was my target to beat.</v>

312
00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:03.870
<v Speaker 2>I want to finally beat him.</v>

313
00:09:03.871 --> 00:09:07.050
<v Speaker 2>It was like climbing Mount Everest and didn't have anything more to prove.</v>

314
00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:09.060
<v Speaker 2>And the fire was debt.</v>

315
00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:09.901
<v Speaker 2>There was no fire.</v>

316
00:09:09.901 --> 00:09:14.100
<v Speaker 2>I was forcing myself to fight and I always said I didn't want to be one of those</v>

317
00:09:14.101 --> 00:09:18.150
<v Speaker 2>people who just fought for money because there's plenty of people were money in</v>

318
00:09:18.151 --> 00:09:18.720
<v Speaker 2>the world,</v>

319
00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:19.553
<v Speaker 2>plenty of them.</v>

320
00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:20.663
<v Speaker 2>But who knows him?</v>

321
00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:21.811
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

322
00:09:21.811 --> 00:09:22.950
<v Speaker 2>the reasons for me fight in,</v>

323
00:09:22.951 --> 00:09:24.180
<v Speaker 2>it's not for money or,</v>

324
00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:25.620
<v Speaker 2>or for belts or glory,</v>

325
00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:29.400
<v Speaker 2>a fight because I don't know anything else.</v>

326
00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:32.880
<v Speaker 2>I've always been a fighter from being born to being 30 years old.</v>

327
00:09:32.881 --> 00:09:34.560
<v Speaker 2>Now it's all I love to do.</v>

328
00:09:34.561 --> 00:09:35.700
<v Speaker 2>I don't have any of a passion.</v>

329
00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:37.103
<v Speaker 2>I've locked.</v>

330
00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:40.060
<v Speaker 2>The Lord knows I've locked and if I had anything else that was going to our I</v>

331
00:09:40.061 --> 00:09:40.650
<v Speaker 2>could do,</v>

332
00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:41.483
<v Speaker 2>I'd be doing it.</v>

333
00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:42.661
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

334
00:09:42.661 --> 00:09:43.650
<v Speaker 2>I tried retirement.</v>

335
00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:48.770
<v Speaker 2>I was 27 I retired on in the second man in boxing heavyweight history to retire</v>

336
00:09:48.811 --> 00:09:51.510
<v Speaker 2>on beaten as a world champion like rocky Malsiano before me,</v>

337
00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:53.100
<v Speaker 2>but it wasn't enough.</v>

338
00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:54.360
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

339
00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:56.160
<v Speaker 2>I am lost without this fight game.</v>

340
00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:57.510
<v Speaker 2>I tried golfing,</v>

341
00:09:57.780 --> 00:09:59.430
<v Speaker 2>I tried clay pigeon shooting.</v>

342
00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:01.200
<v Speaker 2>I tried four by four in,</v>

343
00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:03.060
<v Speaker 2>I tried going to strip clubs,</v>

344
00:10:03.061 --> 00:10:03.631
<v Speaker 2>bars,</v>

345
00:10:03.631 --> 00:10:04.140
<v Speaker 2>restaurants,</v>

346
00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:04.973
<v Speaker 2>everything,</v>

347
00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:09.000
<v Speaker 2>and it was just like I had this emptiness inside where I just want it to fight.</v>

348
00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:10.171
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

349
00:10:10.171 --> 00:10:11.820
<v Speaker 1>in comparison to what you've accomplished,</v>

350
00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:14.190
<v Speaker 1>everything else has to seem pretty dull.</v>

351
00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:14.821
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

352
00:10:14.821 --> 00:10:17.970
<v Speaker 1>until you step into the ring with Vladimir Klitschko,</v>

353
00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:20.850
<v Speaker 1>who was widely considered to be one of the greatest heavyweights ever,</v>

354
00:10:20.851 --> 00:10:22.590
<v Speaker 1>and you box his face off.</v>

355
00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:24.420
<v Speaker 1>I mean that was a beautiful performance.</v>

356
00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:26.820
<v Speaker 1>It walls shut him down.</v>

357
00:10:26.821 --> 00:10:27.654
<v Speaker 1>It was weird.</v>

358
00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:28.620
<v Speaker 1>It was weird to watch them.</v>

359
00:10:28.621 --> 00:10:30.420
<v Speaker 1>It's like there was moments in that fight where he just,</v>

360
00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:32.370
<v Speaker 1>he just looked like he didn't know what to do with you.</v>

361
00:10:32.950 --> 00:10:34.300
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to see you again on December.</v>

362
00:10:34.301 --> 00:10:35.134
<v Speaker 2>The first,</v>

363
00:10:35.950 --> 00:10:36.461
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

364
00:10:36.461 --> 00:10:37.330
<v Speaker 2>to flood has had to,</v>

365
00:10:37.331 --> 00:10:38.980
<v Speaker 2>same thing to Deontay wilder.</v>

366
00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:41.200
<v Speaker 2>You fought the Americans,</v>

367
00:10:41.201 --> 00:10:42.300
<v Speaker 2>you fought the Mexican,</v>

368
00:10:42.301 --> 00:10:43.810
<v Speaker 2>you fought a Europeans.</v>

369
00:10:44.170 --> 00:10:44.351
<v Speaker 2>Paul,</v>

370
00:10:44.351 --> 00:10:46.420
<v Speaker 2>you ain't never fought the gypsy king before.</v>

371
00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:48.070
<v Speaker 2>I said it straight Tivola in me.</v>

372
00:10:48.071 --> 00:10:48.311
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

373
00:10:48.311 --> 00:10:49.180
<v Speaker 2>you look in our king.</v>

374
00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:49.621
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

375
00:10:49.621 --> 00:10:49.691
<v Speaker 2>eve,</v>

376
00:10:49.691 --> 00:10:50.710
<v Speaker 2>you've ever for king before?</v>

377
00:10:50.711 --> 00:10:50.921
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

378
00:10:50.921 --> 00:10:51.550
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

379
00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:51.761
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

380
00:10:51.761 --> 00:10:52.720
<v Speaker 2>we fight him on now.</v>

381
00:10:52.721 --> 00:10:53.051
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>

382
00:10:53.051 --> 00:10:53.950
<v Speaker 2>you're going to lose to one.</v>

383
00:10:54.890 --> 00:10:55.041
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

384
00:10:55.041 --> 00:10:56.180
<v Speaker 1>he's lost before,</v>

385
00:10:56.181 --> 00:10:59.120
<v Speaker 1>but he's lost because he got clipped and hurt and stopped.</v>

386
00:10:59.121 --> 00:11:02.600
<v Speaker 1>And I was very impressed with him actually in the Anthony Joshua fight because</v>

387
00:11:02.601 --> 00:11:05.630
<v Speaker 1>he came back from getting badly hurt and almost put Joshua away.</v>

388
00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:09.560
<v Speaker 1>But the fight with you is different because you just outboxed him.</v>

389
00:11:09.561 --> 00:11:12.290
<v Speaker 1>And he was known as the guy who would box and hold,</v>

390
00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:12.891
<v Speaker 1>Jab,</v>

391
00:11:12.891 --> 00:11:13.580
<v Speaker 1>and hold.</v>

392
00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:13.881
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

393
00:11:13.881 --> 00:11:16.460
<v Speaker 1>he was one of the most boring heavyweights of all time.</v>

394
00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:18.650
<v Speaker 1>Fantastically successful.</v>

395
00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:20.990
<v Speaker 1>But from a spectator point of view,</v>

396
00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:23.450
<v Speaker 1>you watched some of his fights and like Jesus Christ,</v>

397
00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:24.590
<v Speaker 1>he would jab you,</v>

398
00:11:24.591 --> 00:11:25.424
<v Speaker 1>grab you,</v>

399
00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:26.480
<v Speaker 1>Jab and grab you.</v>

400
00:11:26.481 --> 00:11:26.661
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

401
00:11:26.661 --> 00:11:27.441
<v Speaker 1>that was his thing.</v>

402
00:11:27.441 --> 00:11:28.520
<v Speaker 1>Right hand grabbed you.</v>

403
00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:29.580
<v Speaker 1>It worked here.</v>

404
00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:30.860
<v Speaker 1>25 title defenses.</v>

405
00:11:31.070 --> 00:11:32.750
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was very successful,</v>

406
00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:35.060
<v Speaker 1>but that shit didn't work with you.</v>

407
00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:39.260
<v Speaker 2>It didn't for the first time in his whole career he was fighting somebody who</v>

408
00:11:39.261 --> 00:11:40.490
<v Speaker 2>was not just bigger than him,</v>

409
00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:42.530
<v Speaker 2>but more off LATIC who could move more.</v>

410
00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:43.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

411
00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:45.740
<v Speaker 2>so money wasn't just looking for one lucky punch.</v>

412
00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:48.530
<v Speaker 2>I knew going into the fight in me a flight that everybody,</v>

413
00:11:48.531 --> 00:11:51.170
<v Speaker 2>all the rest of the opponents and 25 men before me,</v>

414
00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:53.350
<v Speaker 2>I'd all went in trying to do the same thing,</v>

415
00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:56.490
<v Speaker 2>try to knock him out and he's got,</v>

416
00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:57.650
<v Speaker 2>he's got so men of a,</v>

417
00:11:57.730 --> 00:12:02.440
<v Speaker 2>a weird defense where he puts both arms out in front of him and it's almost very</v>

418
00:12:02.441 --> 00:12:03.710
<v Speaker 2>awkward to London,</v>

419
00:12:03.711 --> 00:12:06.580
<v Speaker 2>not chain where big punches so far.</v>

420
00:12:06.581 --> 00:12:07.450
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to do that.</v>

421
00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:08.440
<v Speaker 2>Not gonna make that mistake.</v>

422
00:12:08.441 --> 00:12:12.430
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to outbox him on all me teams that there's not a good idea.</v>

423
00:12:12.431 --> 00:12:14.380
<v Speaker 2>We've got to go to Germany to try now.</v>

424
00:12:14.381 --> 00:12:16.450
<v Speaker 2>Box a super champion and try and win on the cards.</v>

425
00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:17.283
<v Speaker 2>Are you crazy?</v>

426
00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:17.801
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

427
00:12:17.801 --> 00:12:18.634
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

428
00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:18.941
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

429
00:12:18.941 --> 00:12:19.870
<v Speaker 2>but if I wasn't crazy,</v>

430
00:12:19.871 --> 00:12:20.710
<v Speaker 2>I won't be great.</v>

431
00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:24.550
<v Speaker 2>And I went over there and outboxed him and nobody,</v>

432
00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:28.480
<v Speaker 2>nobody apart from my brother or me father fought,</v>

433
00:12:28.510 --> 00:12:29.343
<v Speaker 2>I could do it.</v>

434
00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:30.700
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

435
00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:32.440
<v Speaker 2>even people who were close to me and camp,</v>

436
00:12:32.441 --> 00:12:33.274
<v Speaker 2>they were like,</v>

437
00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:35.650
<v Speaker 2>they were very unsure of what was gonna happen.</v>

438
00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:38.500
<v Speaker 2>I may be me.</v>

439
00:12:38.501 --> 00:12:40.840
<v Speaker 2>I always had a little smile on my face because I believed it.</v>

440
00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:43.200
<v Speaker 2>I believed I could always beat flooding.</v>

441
00:12:43.201 --> 00:12:43.811
<v Speaker 2>Miracle it go.</v>

442
00:12:43.811 --> 00:12:46.090
<v Speaker 2>I even told Vladimir years before,</v>

443
00:12:46.091 --> 00:12:47.650
<v Speaker 2>when I was 22 I said,</v>

444
00:12:47.651 --> 00:12:51.190
<v Speaker 2>I will beat you one day in manual steward told him to God,</v>

445
00:12:51.191 --> 00:12:52.024
<v Speaker 2>rest his soul.</v>

446
00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:52.781
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

447
00:12:52.781 --> 00:12:54.640
<v Speaker 2>Tyson fury is the heir to the throne.</v>

448
00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:56.651
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

449
00:12:56.651 --> 00:12:59.830
<v Speaker 2>and when his time is ready will be you straight to him.</v>

450
00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:00.551
<v Speaker 2>Pardon me?</v>

451
00:13:00.551 --> 00:13:03.890
<v Speaker 2>I hated that he hated him and y'all talking about me like that.</v>

452
00:13:04.270 --> 00:13:05.091
<v Speaker 1>We don't have evil.</v>

453
00:13:05.091 --> 00:13:05.924
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

454
00:13:06.050 --> 00:13:06.421
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

455
00:13:06.421 --> 00:13:06.741
<v Speaker 1>let me sure.</v>

456
00:13:06.741 --> 00:13:09.080
<v Speaker 1>It was good fire under him during training as well.</v>

457
00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:11.270
<v Speaker 1>Now you,</v>

458
00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:13.190
<v Speaker 1>you were focused for that fight.</v>

459
00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:13.910
<v Speaker 1>You were,</v>

460
00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:17.690
<v Speaker 1>you were prepared and afterwards,</v>

461
00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:22.160
<v Speaker 1>was it just the realization that you would accomplish this incredible goal?</v>

462
00:13:22.161 --> 00:13:23.540
<v Speaker 1>It's set into depression.</v>

463
00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:28.760
<v Speaker 1>Was it you didn't know what to do next or was it just that your focus was now no</v>

464
00:13:28.761 --> 00:13:30.650
<v Speaker 1>longer on this unattainable,</v>

465
00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:31.161
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

466
00:13:31.161 --> 00:13:34.910
<v Speaker 1>like almost insurmountable obstacle in front of you becoming the heavyweight</v>

467
00:13:34.911 --> 00:13:35.744
<v Speaker 1>champion of the world.</v>

468
00:13:35.930 --> 00:13:36.860
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden you did it.</v>

469
00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:38.750
<v Speaker 1>Then the depression kicks in.</v>

470
00:13:39.410 --> 00:13:39.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

471
00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:41.810
<v Speaker 2>my conditioning train a Christian,</v>

472
00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:44.450
<v Speaker 2>he said to me before the Klitschko Fai,</v>

473
00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:45.303
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>

474
00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:46.580
<v Speaker 2>what will you do after you win?</v>

475
00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:48.080
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

476
00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:49.910
<v Speaker 2>probably be depressed for a long time.</v>

477
00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:51.531
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

478
00:13:51.531 --> 00:13:52.364
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>

479
00:13:52.490 --> 00:13:52.821
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

480
00:13:52.821 --> 00:13:53.654
<v Speaker 2>truthfully,</v>

481
00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:57.380
<v Speaker 2>I was almost expecting it and I didn't think I'd have a box again.</v>

482
00:13:57.920 --> 00:13:59.630
<v Speaker 2>Even the day after the Klitschko fight,</v>

483
00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:03.530
<v Speaker 2>sky's boss interviewed me that the UK broad customer put it on and they said,</v>

484
00:14:03.531 --> 00:14:04.760
<v Speaker 2>what's next for Tyson theory?</v>

485
00:14:04.761 --> 00:14:05.594
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

486
00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:06.890
<v Speaker 2>I'll probably never box again.</v>

487
00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:08.893
<v Speaker 2>I knew.</v>

488
00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:09.531
<v Speaker 2>I said to me,</v>

489
00:14:09.531 --> 00:14:11.060
<v Speaker 2>dad and my brothers before the fight,</v>

490
00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:12.530
<v Speaker 2>a week before the fight,</v>

491
00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:12.801
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

492
00:14:12.801 --> 00:14:12.981
<v Speaker 2>win,</v>

493
00:14:12.981 --> 00:14:13.880
<v Speaker 2>lose or draw.</v>

494
00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:14.571
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

495
00:14:14.571 --> 00:14:17.990
<v Speaker 2>this is probably going to be my last fight cause I knew the fire was going.</v>

496
00:14:17.991 --> 00:14:19.370
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have that hunger anymore.</v>

497
00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:23.480
<v Speaker 2>Had the hunger to beat Vladimir Klitschko bought not to carry on and continue.</v>

498
00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:27.350
<v Speaker 2>And I said I didn't want it to be about money or financial gain.</v>

499
00:14:27.830 --> 00:14:29.660
<v Speaker 2>I want it to be the best of my time,</v>

500
00:14:29.661 --> 00:14:30.560
<v Speaker 2>beat the best month.</v>

501
00:14:30.950 --> 00:14:31.820
<v Speaker 2>And that's what I did.</v>

502
00:14:32.090 --> 00:14:33.050
<v Speaker 2>And I was a me where worded,</v>

503
00:14:33.051 --> 00:14:35.780
<v Speaker 2>I didn't box again until</v>

504
00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:41.750
<v Speaker 2>two and a half year later I decided to make a comeback because I was sitting</v>

505
00:14:41.751 --> 00:14:43.380
<v Speaker 2>here 400 pounds,</v>

506
00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:46.280
<v Speaker 2>drug addict and Alcoholic,</v>

507
00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:46.930
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

508
00:14:46.930 --> 00:14:51.930
<v Speaker 2>had never took a drug in my life until I got to 27 really never smoked weed.</v>

509
00:14:52.491 --> 00:14:52.721
<v Speaker 2>Not,</v>

510
00:14:52.721 --> 00:14:53.554
<v Speaker 2>not morphing.</v>

511
00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:55.310
<v Speaker 2>And what drove with drugs?</v>

512
00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:57.920
<v Speaker 2>What were the drugs of choice once you won the title?</v>

513
00:14:58.070 --> 00:15:00.740
<v Speaker 2>Cocaine was the usual one and that was it.</v>

514
00:15:00.741 --> 00:15:01.460
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>

515
00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:02.690
<v Speaker 2>Cocaine and alcohol.</v>

516
00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:04.790
<v Speaker 2>It's like rollercoaster,</v>

517
00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:05.670
<v Speaker 2>crazy drug,</v>

518
00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:06.503
<v Speaker 2>drug and alcohol.</v>

519
00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:08.413
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

520
00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:13.760
<v Speaker 2>I look back on it now and I think what I changed that I wouldn't,</v>

521
00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:15.380
<v Speaker 2>I'm not many people will think,</v>

522
00:15:15.381 --> 00:15:17.570
<v Speaker 2>well this man's crazy for saying that on a radio show.</v>

523
00:15:17.571 --> 00:15:22.220
<v Speaker 2>But I wouldn't change a thing because I know it was supposed to happen and I</v>

524
00:15:22.221 --> 00:15:25.250
<v Speaker 2>needed to be tested to see what type of character of us.</v>

525
00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:29.660
<v Speaker 2>Although I did all those mud things and I went for wall that time and I tried to</v>

526
00:15:29.661 --> 00:15:31.550
<v Speaker 2>commit suicide and I,</v>

527
00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:32.840
<v Speaker 2>how'd you try to commit suicide?</v>

528
00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:33.081
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

529
00:15:33.081 --> 00:15:34.010
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you what happened.</v>

530
00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:36.283
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

531
00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:36.771
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

532
00:15:36.771 --> 00:15:37.431
<v Speaker 2>I was waking up on,</v>

533
00:15:37.431 --> 00:15:38.181
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to be alive.</v>

534
00:15:38.181 --> 00:15:39.770
<v Speaker 2>I was making everybody's life a misery.</v>

535
00:15:39.771 --> 00:15:41.690
<v Speaker 2>Everybody was close to me and was pushing away.</v>

536
00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:43.460
<v Speaker 2>Nobody could talk to me,</v>

537
00:15:43.461 --> 00:15:45.020
<v Speaker 2>talk any sense into me at all.</v>

538
00:15:46.610 --> 00:15:47.443
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

539
00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:49.401
<v Speaker 2>I'd go very,</v>

540
00:15:49.401 --> 00:15:49.671
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

541
00:15:49.671 --> 00:15:54.671
<v Speaker 2>very low at times a very low and I start thinking all these crazy thoughts and</v>

542
00:15:55.011 --> 00:15:55.844
<v Speaker 2>this start near the,</v>

543
00:15:56.180 --> 00:15:57.110
<v Speaker 2>and I was in me car.</v>

544
00:15:57.111 --> 00:15:57.680
<v Speaker 2>I bought a,</v>

545
00:15:57.680 --> 00:16:02.680
<v Speaker 2>bought a brand new Ferrari convertible in the summer of 2016 and I was in the,</v>

546
00:16:04.691 --> 00:16:06.440
<v Speaker 2>Alan was on the highway on this,</v>

547
00:16:06.441 --> 00:16:07.940
<v Speaker 2>a strip of highway where I am,</v>

548
00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:10.790
<v Speaker 2>I'm at the bottom of about a five mile strip.</v>

549
00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:15.710
<v Speaker 2>There's a massive bridged across as a motorway and I knew that and I got the car</v>

550
00:16:15.711 --> 00:16:17.300
<v Speaker 2>up to 190 miles an hour.</v>

551
00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:20.720
<v Speaker 2>I was heading towards up bridge and I didn't care or no,</v>

552
00:16:20.721 --> 00:16:21.350
<v Speaker 2>almost sinking.</v>

553
00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:22.071
<v Speaker 2>I didn't care about her,</v>

554

<v Speaker 2>I didn't care.</v>

560
00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:27.610
<v Speaker 2>I didn't care about nothing.</v>

561
00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:29.060
<v Speaker 2>I just want to die so bad.</v>

565
00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:40.790
<v Speaker 2>I heard a voice say,</v>

566
00:16:40.791 --> 00:16:41.624
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

567

<v Speaker 2>Tyson,</v>

569
00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:44.450
<v Speaker 2>think about your kids.</v>

570
00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:48.710
<v Speaker 2>Think about your family and you'll all boys and girls growing up with no father</v>

571
00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:51.470
<v Speaker 2>and everyone saying your dad was a week mum.</v>

572
00:16:52.610 --> 00:16:53.510
<v Speaker 2>He left his,</v>

573
00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:56.240
<v Speaker 2>he took the easy way out because he couldn't do anything about it</v>

574
00:16:57.980 --> 00:16:59.240
<v Speaker 2>before are turned into the bridge.</v>

575
00:16:59.260 --> 00:16:59.790
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

576
00:16:59.790 --> 00:16:59.900
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

577
00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:01.490

589
00:17:22.161 --> 00:17:23.360
<v Speaker 2>And she said to me that she said,</v>

592
00:17:26.090 --> 00:17:26.400
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:27.233
<v Speaker 2>Yah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>He's an imminent death risk.</v>

600
00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:38.690
<v Speaker 2>That's the highest level of suicide risk that she'd ever assessed it.</v>

601
00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:40.333
<v Speaker 2>And she said,</v>

602
00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:41.930
<v Speaker 2>without his faith,</v>

603
00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:44.540
<v Speaker 2>he would have been dead a long time ago.</v>

604
00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:45.261
<v Speaker 2>But she said,</v>

605
00:17:45.261 --> 00:17:47.570
<v Speaker 2>faith alone ain't gonna hold him cause that's going to break.</v>

613
00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:07.463
<v Speaker 2>I'll just,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I want it.</v>

616
00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:13.380
<v Speaker 2>I just didn't want to live anymore and I had everything that man could want.</v>

617
00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:14.970
<v Speaker 2>There wasn't nothing I didn't have,</v>

618
00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:16.141
<v Speaker 2>but it meant nothing.</v>

619
00:18:16.141 --> 00:18:16.651
<v Speaker 2>Nothing meant.</v>

620
00:18:16.651 --> 00:18:19.020
<v Speaker 2>And even I thought worthless on.</v>

621
00:18:19.021 --> 00:18:19.854
<v Speaker 2>The longer it went on,</v>

622
00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:21.180

<v Speaker 2>everybody give up on me.</v>

625
00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:26.850
<v Speaker 2>And before farm we fall,</v>

626
00:18:26.851 --> 00:18:29.250
<v Speaker 2>I was definitely gonna die and I was going to kill myself.</v>

627
00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:31.470
<v Speaker 2>And after that I tried.</v>

628
00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:32.251

633
00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:36.480
<v Speaker 2>But every time I tried to go to the gym,</v>

634
00:18:36.481 --> 00:18:37.350
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if voice say,</v>

635

637
00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:40.380
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to do this.</v>

638
00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:41.151
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to do it.</v>

639
00:18:41.151 --> 00:18:41.940
<v Speaker 2>I'd run.</v>

640
00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:43.680
<v Speaker 2>I'd run 200 yards and pull up.</v>

641
00:18:44.010 --> 00:18:44.910
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't even get a mile.</v>

642
00:18:44.911 --> 00:18:45.091

00:18:46.111 --> 00:18:46.944
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to do this.</v>

646
00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:48.120
<v Speaker 2>Boxing is not for me.</v>

647

<v Speaker 2>I hated boxing at one stage in 2016 early 17 I wouldn't have done a boxing fight</v>

648
00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:56.700
<v Speaker 2>for this room full of diamonds.</v>

649
00:18:57.150 --> 00:18:57.983

652
00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:01.440
<v Speaker 2>I won't read about it.</v>

653
00:19:01.710 --> 00:19:02.760
<v Speaker 2>I hated boxing.</v>

654
00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:05.760
<v Speaker 2>I've done it my whole life and I didn't want no part of it anymore.</v>

655
00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:08.160
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

656
00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:09.090
<v Speaker 2>I was out drinking.</v>

657
00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:10.550
<v Speaker 2>I didn't gag,</v>

658
00:19:10.550 --> 00:19:13.020
<v Speaker 2>give up taking drugs like I said.</v>

659
00:19:13.470 --> 00:19:15.720
<v Speaker 2>And it comes to a point or was doing that for 18 months.</v>

660
00:19:15.810 --> 00:19:16.643
<v Speaker 2>My life.</v>

661
00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:20.340
<v Speaker 2>And I was out 2017 Halloween.</v>

662
00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:22.650
<v Speaker 2>I was a 400 lbs,</v>

663
00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:26.940
<v Speaker 2>dressed up as a skeleton and I go to this fancy dress party in it.</v>

664
00:19:26.970 --> 00:19:28.110
<v Speaker 2>I'm looking around and I'm thinking,</v>

665
00:19:28.290 --> 00:19:30.030
<v Speaker 2>these are all young kids compared to me.</v>

666
00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:33.540
<v Speaker 2>I'm 30 and I feel like I was the oldest guy in there like 29 I was like,</v>

667
00:19:33.810 --> 00:19:34.890
<v Speaker 2>what am I doing here?</v>

668
00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:36.450
<v Speaker 2>Is this what you want for your life?</v>

669
00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:38.190
<v Speaker 2>And I thought to myself,</v>

670
00:19:38.190 --> 00:19:40.410
<v Speaker 2>this is not me a number.</v>

671
00:19:40.411 --> 00:19:42.360
<v Speaker 2>How many people told me before this</v>

672
00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:44.940
<v Speaker 2>while I was going wrong,</v>

673
00:19:44.941 --> 00:19:46.410
<v Speaker 2>what was due and you need to act to your life.</v>

674
00:19:46.530 --> 00:19:48.480
<v Speaker 2>You can only change your life if you want to change it.</v>

675
00:19:49.290 --> 00:19:50.500
<v Speaker 2>And I left and everyone said,</v>

676
00:19:50.501 --> 00:19:50.790
<v Speaker 2>are you going?</v>

677
00:19:50.790 --> 00:19:50.941
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

00:19:51.841 --> 00:19:52.350
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

680
00:19:52.350 --> 00:19:53.280
<v Speaker 2>I left at nine o'clock.</v>

681
00:19:53.281 --> 00:19:55.170
<v Speaker 2>I went home and I got back home.</v>

682
00:19:55.171 --> 00:19:56.180
<v Speaker 2>I didn't say anything to the line,</v>

683
00:19:56.181 --> 00:19:58.140
<v Speaker 2>but it went straight upstairs into a dark room</v>

684
00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:01.120
<v Speaker 2>and I took burst.</v>

685
00:20:01.121 --> 00:20:01.980
<v Speaker 2>Chief had skeleton,</v>

686
00:20:01.981 --> 00:20:02.814
<v Speaker 2>so tough.</v>

687
00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:07.800
<v Speaker 2>I know I was up there and I got on my knees and I was praying and begging God to</v>

688
00:20:07.801 --> 00:20:08.634
<v Speaker 2>help me.</v>

689
00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:10.300
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

690
00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:11.520
<v Speaker 2>at this point I'd never,</v>

691
00:20:11.610 --> 00:20:14.690
<v Speaker 2>I've never begged or cried to God to help maybe for her,</v>

692
00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:15.600
<v Speaker 2>prayed a lot,</v>

693
00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:16.673
<v Speaker 2>all my life,</v>

694
00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:19.230
<v Speaker 2>but I'd never been in this physical state before.</v>

695
00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:21.720
<v Speaker 2>I could feel tears running down my face.</v>

696
00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:26.400
<v Speaker 2>My chest was wet with tears because I knew I couldn't do it on my own.</v>

697
00:20:27.050 --> 00:20:32.040
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't possible for me because I tried and tried and tried and ended up back</v>

698
00:20:32.041 --> 00:20:32.740
<v Speaker 2>in Nepal,</v>

699
00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:33.573
<v Speaker 2>back drinking.</v>

700
00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:37.680
<v Speaker 2>I almost accepted that that was going to be my fate and alcoholic.</v>

701
00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:40.800
<v Speaker 2>So I was on my knees in his bedroom.</v>

702
00:20:41.450 --> 00:20:42.283
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

703
00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:44.250
<v Speaker 2>after praying for about 10 minutes,</v>

704
00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:49.760
<v Speaker 2>I got up and I felt the weight of the world was lifted off my shoulders and for</v>

705
00:20:51.371 --> 00:20:55.450
<v Speaker 2>the first time in years I knew it was going to make a comeback.</v>

706
00:20:56.020 --> 00:20:56.501
<v Speaker 2>And I called,</v>

707
00:20:56.501 --> 00:20:57.390

711
00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:01.960
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

714
00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:07.511

720
00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:13.750
<v Speaker 2>I'd come back and I'm going to be the heavyweight champion of the world again.</v>

721
00:21:13.751 --> 00:21:14.290
<v Speaker 2>Cause it was,</v>

722
00:21:14.290 --> 00:21:15.490
<v Speaker 2>it was the alcohol talking.</v>

723
00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:20.800
<v Speaker 2>So I was like the man who called Wolf a thousand times on this,</v>

724
00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:22.970
<v Speaker 2>this jeep had Korea that I,</v>

725
00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:27.820
<v Speaker 2>that I was living on the past thinking about years before glory days.</v>

726
00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:29.860
<v Speaker 2>And after this prior I got up,</v>

727
00:21:29.861 --> 00:21:30.090
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

728
00:21:30.090 --> 00:21:30.400
<v Speaker 2>boy,</v>

729
00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:30.971
<v Speaker 2>this is going to be,</v>

730
00:21:30.971 --> 00:21:32.320
<v Speaker 2>she didn't believe me one second.</v>

731
00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:34.090
<v Speaker 2>But even when I speak to her now,</v>

732
00:21:34.091 --> 00:21:34.541
<v Speaker 2>she says,</v>

733
00:21:34.541 --> 00:21:35.021
<v Speaker 2>not night.</v>

734
00:21:35.021 --> 00:21:35.621
<v Speaker 2>You told me that.</v>

735
00:21:35.621 --> 00:21:35.921
<v Speaker 2>She said,</v>

736
00:21:35.921 --> 00:21:40.921
<v Speaker 2>I earn a difference in your voice swimming up and next day I phoned up Ben</v>

737
00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:43.870
<v Speaker 2>Davison and I said,</v>

738
00:21:43.871 --> 00:21:46.540
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to go back downhill route but as same trainer,</v>

739
00:21:46.541 --> 00:21:49.850
<v Speaker 2>same promote to say many things and everything's got to change as it's is going</v>

740
00:21:49.851 --> 00:21:51.040
<v Speaker 2>to be a new Tyson fury.</v>

741
00:21:53.050 --> 00:21:53.711
<v Speaker 2>And we called it,</v>

742
00:21:53.711 --> 00:21:54.910
<v Speaker 2>returned to the mock mission.</v>

743
00:21:56.290 --> 00:21:59.860
<v Speaker 2>And as I went out that morning off the phone in Bannon or arranging everything</v>

744
00:21:59.861 --> 00:22:00.700
<v Speaker 2>and went out for a run,</v>

745
00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:03.490
<v Speaker 2>it may sweat soaked out IOD ambitions of running two miles.</v>

746
00:22:04.540 --> 00:22:07.480
<v Speaker 2>I got about five minutes into the Roman,</v>

747
00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:09.850
<v Speaker 2>stopped on a walked</v>

748
00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:12.430
<v Speaker 2>and while I was walking,</v>

749
00:22:12.930 --> 00:22:17.200
<v Speaker 2>I can't run them too up to 400 pounds before I'm going to walk,</v>

750
00:22:17.201 --> 00:22:18.220
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to get out and walk.</v>

751
00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:19.511
<v Speaker 2>While I was walking,</v>

752
00:22:19.511 --> 00:22:23.920
<v Speaker 2>I was flicking through my phone on Instagram and I sees this video of</v>

753
00:22:23.921 --> 00:22:24.401
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] tape,</v>

754
00:22:24.401 --> 00:22:26.290
<v Speaker 2>wilder say in,</v>

755
00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:26.770
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

756
00:22:26.770 --> 00:22:30.130
<v Speaker 2>Tyson theories finally done that because the week before I'd been a boxing show</v>

757
00:22:30.131 --> 00:22:32.620
<v Speaker 2>in Manchester or something and the press took a picture.</v>

758
00:22:32.621 --> 00:22:32.831
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

759
00:22:32.831 --> 00:22:33.670
<v Speaker 2>it was like everywhere.</v>

760
00:22:33.671 --> 00:22:35.410
<v Speaker 2>This big fat out of shape,</v>

761
00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:39.200
<v Speaker 2>ugly ball that it bearded white as a sheet man.</v>

762
00:22:39.250 --> 00:22:43.900
<v Speaker 2>I was like a state and a this video.</v>

763
00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:46.180
<v Speaker 2>Yet after seeing this evidence at Tyson fury,</v>

764
00:22:46.181 --> 00:22:48.010
<v Speaker 2>I finally know he's finished.</v>

765
00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:50.440
<v Speaker 2>It can never come back.</v>

766
00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:51.700
<v Speaker 2>And if he,</v>

767
00:22:51.701 --> 00:22:53.500
<v Speaker 2>even if our water fought him and he's aid aid,</v>

768
00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:54.393
<v Speaker 2>I'd have knocked him out.</v>

769
00:22:55.590 --> 00:22:57.950
<v Speaker 2>And before that he was talking about Mike Tyson.</v>

770
00:22:57.951 --> 00:22:59.020
<v Speaker 2>Now we'd not Mike Tyson.</v>

771
00:22:59.021 --> 00:23:00.880
<v Speaker 2>I went around and I thought myself,</v>

772
00:23:00.881 --> 00:23:05.200
<v Speaker 2>that was very disrespectful to talk about someone who's not even from your era</v>

773
00:23:05.290 --> 00:23:07.210
<v Speaker 2>and one and divide them and all that sort of stuff.</v>

774
00:23:07.450 --> 00:23:07.620
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

775
00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:08.650
<v Speaker 2>There's no possible chance.</v>

776
00:23:08.660 --> 00:23:09.750
<v Speaker 2>So photos have,</v>

777
00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:10.571
<v Speaker 2>you know what I've ever do,</v>

778
00:23:10.571 --> 00:23:10.941
<v Speaker 2>fight you.</v>

779
00:23:10.941 --> 00:23:12.130
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to give it you for that reason.</v>

780
00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:15.550
<v Speaker 2>And then when I saw this over video of him saying things about me and that I</v>

781
00:23:15.551 --> 00:23:16.384
<v Speaker 2>couldn't come back,</v>

782
00:23:16.990 --> 00:23:21.700
<v Speaker 2>he gave me that much more motivation to return just so I can beat Deontay</v>

783
00:23:21.701 --> 00:23:22.534
<v Speaker 2>wilder.</v>

784
00:23:23.230 --> 00:23:26.200
<v Speaker 2>So I'd always caught cases on as well.</v>

785
00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:29.290
<v Speaker 2>I was being charged where we've taken performance and unseen drugs.</v>

786
00:23:29.290 --> 00:23:31.510
<v Speaker 2>Nandrolone something I'd never done.</v>

787
00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:31.930
<v Speaker 2>I had,</v>

788
00:23:31.930 --> 00:23:33.180
<v Speaker 2>I had an nandrolone enemies system.</v>

789
00:23:33.190 --> 00:23:34.050
<v Speaker 2>It's produced naturally,</v>

790
00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:34.913
<v Speaker 2>nobody,</v>

791
00:23:34.990 --> 00:23:36.730
<v Speaker 2>but they say my levels were elevated.</v>

792
00:23:37.650 --> 00:23:38.360
<v Speaker 2>Dka,</v>

793
00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:40.690
<v Speaker 2>UK Anti doping said there was no case to answer,</v>

794
00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:46.500
<v Speaker 2>but all of a sudden I had a big water case on me that took three years to salt</v>

795
00:23:47.181 --> 00:23:50.070
<v Speaker 2>out and buy on every one side.</v>

796
00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:51.440
<v Speaker 2>Y'All getting in Hotmail,</v>

797
00:23:51.441 --> 00:23:52.274
<v Speaker 2>Donnie Hassan,</v>

798
00:23:52.370 --> 00:23:54.440
<v Speaker 2>you get a 12 year bomb and I said,</v>

799
00:23:54.441 --> 00:23:54.861
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

800
00:23:54.861 --> 00:23:56.510
<v Speaker 2>Well you've 12 years,</v>

801
00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:58.010
<v Speaker 2>not just for an Angelo.</v>

802
00:23:58.800 --> 00:23:59.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm refused on as well.</v>

803
00:23:59.931 --> 00:24:03.080
<v Speaker 2>I was in a bad mood one day and the drug test and people come in the gym and</v>

804
00:24:03.081 --> 00:24:04.220
<v Speaker 2>I've told them to fuck off.</v>

805
00:24:04.670 --> 00:24:06.560
<v Speaker 2>This is when you were training for your comeback?</v>

806
00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:07.880
<v Speaker 2>This was when I was out with training.</v>

807
00:24:07.881 --> 00:24:08.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

808
00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:13.070
<v Speaker 2>When I was just all the time I was fat and out of shape and not train and I was</v>

809
00:24:13.071 --> 00:24:15.680
<v Speaker 2>still being run them drug tested by UK Aad.</v>

810
00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:16.190
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

811
00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:18.350
<v Speaker 2>That's why I tested positive twice for cocaine</v>

812
00:24:20.590 --> 00:24:22.360
<v Speaker 2>and everyone said no,</v>

813
00:24:22.450 --> 00:24:23.600
<v Speaker 2>he never getting back the,</v>

814
00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:26.860
<v Speaker 2>the boxing board of control spending my license in the UK for the cocaine,</v>

815
00:24:26.890 --> 00:24:27.130
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

816
00:24:27.130 --> 00:24:27.963
<v Speaker 2>use.</v>

817
00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:31.330
<v Speaker 2>So I had a court case looking at been far band forever,</v>

818
00:24:31.331 --> 00:24:33.640
<v Speaker 2>basically suspension.</v>

819
00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:37.450
<v Speaker 2>The doctor made me medically unfit to fight,</v>

820
00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:40.330
<v Speaker 2>so that was after I forgot about that bit.</v>

821
00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:43.390
<v Speaker 2>When I was rescheduling the Klitschko to fight,</v>

822
00:24:44.410 --> 00:24:46.090
<v Speaker 2>the psychiatrist phoned up and he says,</v>

823
00:24:46.091 --> 00:24:46.450
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

824
00:24:46.450 --> 00:24:47.520
<v Speaker 2>he is medically unfit.</v>

825
00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:48.640
<v Speaker 2>He can't fight anybody,</v>

826
00:24:48.641 --> 00:24:49.210
<v Speaker 2>don't want to live,</v>

827
00:24:49.210 --> 00:24:50.043
<v Speaker 2>nevermind fight.</v>

828
00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:53.040
<v Speaker 2>So I was medically deemed unfit to box,</v>

829
00:24:53.041 --> 00:24:56.530
<v Speaker 2>suspended by the boxing board of Control for the cocaine use on out an</v>

830
00:24:56.531 --> 00:24:57.610
<v Speaker 2>underlying case on me.</v>

831
00:24:57.710 --> 00:25:00.130
<v Speaker 2>I'm a refusal case and by the way,</v>

832
00:25:00.131 --> 00:25:02.530
<v Speaker 2>it was racking up millions of dollars in lawyers' face too.</v>

833
00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:06.680
<v Speaker 2>But I was so confident that I was going to,</v>

834
00:25:07.010 --> 00:25:10.130
<v Speaker 2>everything was going to be okay because when I was down on my knees,</v>

835
00:25:10.131 --> 00:25:12.920
<v Speaker 2>I just knew that it was going to be okay and everyone was like,</v>

836
00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:16.100
<v Speaker 2>what's the point in training and doing anything with you when you're not,</v>

837
00:25:16.101 --> 00:25:16.761
<v Speaker 2>you can't do anything.</v>

838
00:25:16.761 --> 00:25:17.810
<v Speaker 2>You're not in a position to do it.</v>

839
00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:18.441
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

840
00:25:18.441 --> 00:25:19.610
<v Speaker 2>everything's going to be all right.</v>

841
00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:20.473
<v Speaker 2>Don't worry.</v>

842
00:25:20.930 --> 00:25:22.640
<v Speaker 2>Court case comes along in December,</v>

843
00:25:23.450 --> 00:25:24.283
<v Speaker 2>we'll go.</v>

844
00:25:24.410 --> 00:25:24.741
<v Speaker 2>They say,</v>

845
00:25:24.741 --> 00:25:24.981
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

846
00:25:24.981 --> 00:25:27.350
<v Speaker 2>this court case has dragged on insufficient evidence.</v>

847
00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:28.453
<v Speaker 2>Get rid of it.</v>

848
00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:31.490
<v Speaker 2>We both agreed that we was going to call it quits on the case.</v>

849
00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:32.331
<v Speaker 2>I like on my way.</v>

850
00:25:32.331 --> 00:25:32.720
<v Speaker 2>They got,</v>

851
00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:34.460
<v Speaker 2>as they pay their legal fees,</v>

852
00:25:34.461 --> 00:25:35.810
<v Speaker 2>I pay my legal fees.</v>

853
00:25:35.990 --> 00:25:36.800
<v Speaker 2>Tom,</v>

854
00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:38.270
<v Speaker 2>that was a drugs case out the window.</v>

855
00:25:38.271 --> 00:25:39.104
<v Speaker 2>Finished</v>

856
00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:41.330
<v Speaker 2>the suspension.</v>

857
00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:44.780
<v Speaker 2>I got to meet him with a border control in the UK and they said,</v>

858
00:25:44.781 --> 00:25:45.430
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

859
00:25:45.430 --> 00:25:49.790
<v Speaker 2>if if you can get past medically fit by doctor mentally,</v>

860
00:25:50.540 --> 00:25:52.070
<v Speaker 2>then we'll reassess your case.</v>

861
00:25:52.130 --> 00:25:53.210
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling and denied.</v>

862
00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:54.553
<v Speaker 2>So I said right,</v>

863
00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:55.513
<v Speaker 2>no problem.</v>

864
00:25:55.550 --> 00:25:56.051
<v Speaker 2>Phone doctor,</v>

865
00:25:56.051 --> 00:25:57.730
<v Speaker 2>the psychiatrist or seeing people who would,</v>

866
00:25:57.830 --> 00:25:59.840
<v Speaker 2>who had spoke to all these doctors,</v>

867
00:25:59.841 --> 00:26:00.860
<v Speaker 2>three or four different doctor,</v>

868
00:26:00.861 --> 00:26:01.221
<v Speaker 2>Phil's,</v>

869
00:26:01.221 --> 00:26:02.120
<v Speaker 2>Dr. Jones,</v>

870
00:26:02.390 --> 00:26:04.520
<v Speaker 2>whoever else said or I need to,</v>

871
00:26:04.521 --> 00:26:05.420
<v Speaker 2>I need reassessing.</v>

872
00:26:05.860 --> 00:26:10.760
<v Speaker 2>Reyes has me bang pass with flying colors and went back to the border control</v>

873
00:26:10.761 --> 00:26:13.340
<v Speaker 2>handed in my certificate by all these different doctors,</v>

874
00:26:13.341 --> 00:26:14.121
<v Speaker 2>examinations,</v>

875
00:26:14.121 --> 00:26:15.350
<v Speaker 2>physical and mental.</v>

876
00:26:15.890 --> 00:26:18.290
<v Speaker 2>They said we have no other choice but to give you a license reinstated,</v>

877
00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:19.183
<v Speaker 2>Bang.</v>

878
00:26:19.490 --> 00:26:22.280
<v Speaker 2>So it was three of the biggest obstacles in my life at once.</v>

879
00:26:22.670 --> 00:26:24.890
<v Speaker 2>We're all done within a month or two straight away.</v>

880
00:26:25.310 --> 00:26:29.060
<v Speaker 2>Then I just had the easy task of lose in 160 pounds,</v>

881
00:26:30.830 --> 00:26:32.120
<v Speaker 2>whichever kind of got overall,</v>

882
00:26:32.121 --> 00:26:32.751
<v Speaker 2>I'm other things.</v>

883
00:26:32.751 --> 00:26:35.300
<v Speaker 2>Losing weight as a fighter was something that I'd done that tron.</v>

884
00:26:35.301 --> 00:26:36.134
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

885
00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:41.380
<v Speaker 2>so then me and Ben sat about losing this 160 pounds along the way back home.</v>

886
00:26:41.510 --> 00:26:42.560
<v Speaker 2>Spoke to Frank Warren.</v>

887
00:26:42.561 --> 00:26:43.560
<v Speaker 2>He became a promoter.</v>

888
00:26:43.990 --> 00:26:44.910
<v Speaker 2>I'm frank said,</v>

889
00:26:44.911 --> 00:26:45.270
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

890
00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:46.470
<v Speaker 2>you've on a long time out the ring.</v>

891
00:26:46.471 --> 00:26:47.490
<v Speaker 2>You've abused your body.</v>

892
00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:52.680
<v Speaker 2>Let's get your four or five comeback flights just so you're ready.</v>

893
00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:53.641
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

894
00:26:53.641 --> 00:26:53.941
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

895
00:26:53.941 --> 00:26:54.774
<v Speaker 2>no problem.</v>

896
00:26:54.980 --> 00:26:55.990
<v Speaker 2>Healthy might fight.</v>

897
00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:57.030
<v Speaker 2>How'd the other combat fight?</v>

898
00:26:57.660 --> 00:26:58.230
<v Speaker 2>I said to frank,</v>

899
00:26:58.230 --> 00:26:59.520
<v Speaker 2>I don't need any more combat fights.</v>

900
00:26:59.521 --> 00:27:00.710
<v Speaker 2>Make the wilder flight now.</v>

901
00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:02.220
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

902
00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:02.360
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

903
00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:02.521
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

904
00:27:02.521 --> 00:27:02.611
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

905
00:27:02.611 --> 00:27:02.791
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

906
00:27:02.791 --> 00:27:03.091
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

907
00:27:03.091 --> 00:27:04.800
<v Speaker 2>let's have a couple more just in case.</v>

908
00:27:05.130 --> 00:27:05.401
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

909
00:27:05.401 --> 00:27:06.234
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling you,</v>

910
00:27:06.330 --> 00:27:07.470
<v Speaker 2>make the wild a fight.</v>

911
00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:09.390
<v Speaker 2>So this is where people don't understand.</v>

912
00:27:09.450 --> 00:27:10.950
<v Speaker 2>I've picked Deontay wilder.</v>

913
00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:12.060
<v Speaker 2>He didn't pick me.</v>

914
00:27:12.510 --> 00:27:13.343
<v Speaker 2>I picked him.</v>

915
00:27:13.950 --> 00:27:14.161
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

916
00:27:14.161 --> 00:27:16.050
<v Speaker 2>he needs a high profile opponent right now,</v>

917
00:27:16.051 --> 00:27:17.430
<v Speaker 2>but does it looks like,</v>

918
00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:18.690
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

919
00:27:18.690 --> 00:27:20.730
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to say that Joshua was ducking him,</v>

920
00:27:20.850 --> 00:27:22.710
<v Speaker 2>but it looked like he had to say that.</v>

921
00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:23.573
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

922
00:27:23.670 --> 00:27:24.780
<v Speaker 2>there's something going on.</v>

923
00:27:24.781 --> 00:27:25.930
<v Speaker 2>He Wa who,</v>

924
00:27:25.970 --> 00:27:29.040
<v Speaker 2>whether it's as his management or his promoter,</v>

925
00:27:29.340 --> 00:27:32.010
<v Speaker 2>they didn't seem to want that fight right away.</v>

926
00:27:32.250 --> 00:27:34.460
<v Speaker 2>I know some quite close details on that.</v>

927
00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:37.530
<v Speaker 2>Todd is the detail details is um,</v>

928
00:27:38.350 --> 00:27:40.530
<v Speaker 2>wildest team offered Joshua's team,</v>

929
00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:43.650
<v Speaker 2>$80 million for a two flight deal,</v>

930
00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:46.230
<v Speaker 2>$50 million for the first fight.</v>

931
00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:48.360
<v Speaker 2>And I'm 30 million for the rematch.</v>

932
00:27:48.390 --> 00:27:53.390
<v Speaker 2>If Joshua lost and they declined up and my lawyer Robert Davis,</v>

933
00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:55.320
<v Speaker 2>he saw a proof of funds from my layman.</v>

934
00:27:56.490 --> 00:27:57.570
<v Speaker 2>So Eddie earn and he's,</v>

935
00:27:57.630 --> 00:28:00.480
<v Speaker 2>each chunk buddies can all say this suddenly of a pull.</v>

936
00:28:00.481 --> 00:28:03.180
<v Speaker 2>I know the truth cause proof of funds we're seeing.</v>

937
00:28:03.870 --> 00:28:07.740
<v Speaker 2>So you think it's because of when Klitschko knocked him down and had him hurt,</v>

938
00:28:07.770 --> 00:28:10.500
<v Speaker 2>they were worried about Deontae with his big power.</v>

939
00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:13.200
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's about eva fighter.</v>

940
00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:14.340
<v Speaker 2>It's bigger than that.</v>

941
00:28:14.340 --> 00:28:15.180
<v Speaker 2>It's about money,</v>

942
00:28:15.450 --> 00:28:16.640
<v Speaker 2>about keeping the money role,</v>

943
00:28:16.690 --> 00:28:18.040
<v Speaker 2>keeping the golden goose lane,</v>

944
00:28:18.041 --> 00:28:18.421
<v Speaker 2>their mags,</v>

945
00:28:18.421 --> 00:28:19.230
<v Speaker 2>looking after it.</v>

946
00:28:19.230 --> 00:28:24.060
<v Speaker 2>Don't take any risks with Joshua was Olympic gold medalist and in the UK it's a</v>

947
00:28:24.061 --> 00:28:24.720
<v Speaker 2>massive story.</v>

948
00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:25.650
<v Speaker 2>Sells out stadiums,</v>

949
00:28:25.651 --> 00:28:26.431
<v Speaker 2>70,000,</v>

950
00:28:26.431 --> 00:28:27.420
<v Speaker 2>90,000.</v>

951
00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:28.290
<v Speaker 2>Huge Star.</v>

952
00:28:28.290 --> 00:28:29.123
<v Speaker 2>Huge data.</v>

953
00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:30.533
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

954
00:28:30.990 --> 00:28:34.920
<v Speaker 2>so why would you want to get him beat by somebody who nobody's really heard of</v>

955
00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:36.240
<v Speaker 2>or even take a risk of it?</v>

956
00:28:37.290 --> 00:28:38.940
<v Speaker 2>They took the risk in Nicolette JCO fight.</v>

957
00:28:40.590 --> 00:28:42.090
<v Speaker 2>It almost didn't pay off.</v>

958
00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:44.100
<v Speaker 2>They scrape through skin of the teeth,</v>

959
00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:44.761
<v Speaker 2>put heat on it,</v>

960
00:28:44.761 --> 00:28:45.241
<v Speaker 2>fair play.</v>

961
00:28:45.241 --> 00:28:46.200
<v Speaker 2>He got up off the canvas,</v>

962
00:28:46.450 --> 00:28:50.770
<v Speaker 2>showed a champion's heart to come back and knock out Klitschko fairplay ball.</v>

963
00:28:50.930 --> 00:28:51.763
<v Speaker 2>Since then,</v>

964
00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:55.140
<v Speaker 2>they haven't remotely stepped off a tall default.</v>

965
00:28:55.141 --> 00:28:56.040
<v Speaker 2>Joseph Parker,</v>

966
00:28:56.820 --> 00:28:57.930
<v Speaker 2>and he did knock Josee Park,</v>

967
00:28:57.931 --> 00:28:58.061
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

968
00:28:58.061 --> 00:28:59.370
<v Speaker 2>It didn't even hurt Josie Parker,</v>

969
00:29:01.110 --> 00:29:03.870
<v Speaker 2>he fought Carlos Tucker had a hard fight with him,</v>

970
00:29:03.970 --> 00:29:04.780
<v Speaker 2>had a hard fight,</v>

971
00:29:04.780 --> 00:29:05.610
<v Speaker 2>hard fight.</v>

972
00:29:05.610 --> 00:29:07.710
<v Speaker 2>So that just keeping up money,</v>

973
00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:08.573
<v Speaker 2>train going.</v>

974
00:29:08.850 --> 00:29:11.340
<v Speaker 2>And I don't blame him because this is a business at the end of the day.</v>

975
00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:13.380
<v Speaker 2>And if I was his management team,</v>

976
00:29:13.381 --> 00:29:14.700
<v Speaker 2>I'd say stay away from fury.</v>

977
00:29:14.730 --> 00:29:17.850
<v Speaker 2>Stay away from wilder and we'll just fight the rest of the people and keep</v>

978
00:29:17.851 --> 00:29:19.380
<v Speaker 2>making plenty of money.</v>

979
00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:24.120
<v Speaker 2>Why do we need to fight these guys who are very risky for that may be a little</v>

980
00:29:24.121 --> 00:29:25.410
<v Speaker 2>bit more than we're getting now.</v>

981
00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:26.390
<v Speaker 2>Two Times more,</v>

982
00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:26.970
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

983
00:29:26.970 --> 00:29:27.691
<v Speaker 2>But in the long run,</v>

984
00:29:27.691 --> 00:29:31.020
<v Speaker 2>we can have five plates and not get beat by mediocre people who were,</v>

985
00:29:31.030 --> 00:29:31.261
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

986
00:29:31.261 --> 00:29:36.261
<v Speaker 2>he's going to beat and get the same money or more so it doesn't make sense.</v>

987
00:29:36.570 --> 00:29:38.220
<v Speaker 2>So this is why me wild.</v>

988
00:29:38.221 --> 00:29:41.560
<v Speaker 2>Everyone agreed to fight because at one time or another,</v>

989
00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:43.510
<v Speaker 2>it's got to be more than about money.</v>

990
00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:44.980
<v Speaker 2>Like we're fighters were.</v>

991
00:29:44.981 --> 00:29:45.371
<v Speaker 2>Wherever you were,</v>

992
00:29:45.371 --> 00:29:46.300
<v Speaker 2>tell me is the world,</v>

993
00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:47.081
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>

994
00:29:47.081 --> 00:29:48.550
<v Speaker 2>we've made money in our careers,</v>

995
00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:50.440
<v Speaker 2>have a 28 professional fight,</v>

996
00:29:50.441 --> 00:29:51.790
<v Speaker 2>27 professional flights.</v>

997
00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:52.893
<v Speaker 2>I've made money.</v>

998
00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:54.700
<v Speaker 2>It's about more than Molly now.</v>

999
00:29:54.701 --> 00:29:58.390
<v Speaker 2>Surely if I spend the money have already wasted and I'm stupid,</v>

1000
00:29:58.630 --> 00:30:01.360
<v Speaker 2>then 200 million would be no good to me because I'd spend anyway,</v>

1001
00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:02.433
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1002
00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:03.560
<v Speaker 2>We Dot always has a felony.</v>

1003
00:30:03.580 --> 00:30:05.140
<v Speaker 2>He's mourning is very easily part of it.</v>

1004
00:30:05.710 --> 00:30:07.660
<v Speaker 2>But that's another story for another day.</v>

1005
00:30:08.350 --> 00:30:09.550
<v Speaker 2>Going back on to this fight,</v>

1006
00:30:09.910 --> 00:30:14.910
<v Speaker 2>we owe it to the funds to gave them a proper fight of two so called people who</v>

1007
00:30:16.421 --> 00:30:17.410
<v Speaker 2>think that the best.</v>

1008
00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:18.813
<v Speaker 2>Let's prove it.</v>

1009
00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:22.960
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't a hard negotiation thing on a steel Neeva when me and wild hope you</v>

1010
00:30:22.961 --> 00:30:24.070
<v Speaker 2>don't mind and hope he's team,</v>

1011
00:30:24.071 --> 00:30:27.730
<v Speaker 2>don't mind me saying that they were the most terrorist,</v>

1012
00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:29.770
<v Speaker 2>more straight going people I've ever worked with.</v>

1013
00:30:30.550 --> 00:30:32.170
<v Speaker 2>There was no if buts or maybes.</v>

1014
00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:33.520
<v Speaker 2>Wherever I asked for,</v>

1015
00:30:33.521 --> 00:30:34.650
<v Speaker 2>they agreed and I have it.</v>

1016
00:30:34.651 --> 00:30:35.240
<v Speaker 2>He asked for,</v>

1017
00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:36.073
<v Speaker 2>I've agreed to.</v>

1018
00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:37.151
<v Speaker 2>There was no,</v>

1019
00:30:37.151 --> 00:30:38.710
<v Speaker 2>it was no hard negotiations.</v>

1020
00:30:38.711 --> 00:30:39.191
<v Speaker 2>It was very,</v>

1021
00:30:39.191 --> 00:30:40.030
<v Speaker 2>very simple.</v>

1022
00:30:40.740 --> 00:30:41.260
<v Speaker 2>Wild,</v>

1023
00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:41.880
<v Speaker 2>clearly</v>

1024
00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:44.320
<v Speaker 1>seems to want to prove that he's the best.</v>

1025
00:30:44.540 --> 00:30:44.740
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1026
00:30:44.740 --> 00:30:45.900
<v Speaker 2>I've got to admire him for that.</v>

1027
00:30:46.010 --> 00:30:46.250
<v Speaker 1>Myra,</v>

1028
00:30:46.250 --> 00:30:46.771
<v Speaker 1>that as well.</v>

1029
00:30:46.771 --> 00:30:46.951
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1030
00:30:46.951 --> 00:30:47.910
<v Speaker 1>he's got a title,</v>

1031
00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:48.751
<v Speaker 1>he's undefeated.</v>

1032
00:30:48.751 --> 00:30:49.800
<v Speaker 1>He's smashing everybody.</v>

1033
00:30:49.801 --> 00:30:53.670
<v Speaker 1>They put in front of them and he has a legacy on his mind.</v>

1034
00:30:53.671 --> 00:30:54.361
<v Speaker 1>He wants to leave.</v>

1035
00:30:54.361 --> 00:30:57.120
<v Speaker 1>A real legacy is why he looked to fight you.</v>

1036
00:30:57.360 --> 00:30:57.661
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1037
00:30:57.661 --> 00:31:01.530
<v Speaker 2>I believe that I've got to give Deontay wilder a lot of credit and respect for</v>

1038
00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:06.600
<v Speaker 2>an aberration because he seems to be that he was the only man at the time before</v>

1039
00:31:06.661 --> 00:31:07.560
<v Speaker 2>I was even coming back.</v>

1040
00:31:07.590 --> 00:31:12.330
<v Speaker 2>He was willing to risk everything he's got to prove is the best and isn't that</v>

1041
00:31:12.331 --> 00:31:13.410
<v Speaker 2>what flight is about?</v>

1042
00:31:13.830 --> 00:31:16.700
<v Speaker 2>Where men want to prove to the best of all the others.</v>

1043
00:31:16.820 --> 00:31:17.001
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1044
00:31:17.001 --> 00:31:19.760
<v Speaker 1>he's absolutely behaving like a true champion.</v>

1045
00:31:19.820 --> 00:31:19.941
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1046
00:31:19.941 --> 00:31:20.690
<v Speaker 1>that's what everybody,</v>

1047
00:31:20.690 --> 00:31:21.770
<v Speaker 1>that's what fans want.</v>

1048
00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:23.600
<v Speaker 1>They want a guy like that and a guy like you,</v>

1049
00:31:24.310 --> 00:31:25.143
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1050
00:31:25.220 --> 00:31:29.600
<v Speaker 2>I've got admire him because to pick me a six hot nine mover,</v>

1051
00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:30.081
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>

1052
00:31:30.081 --> 00:31:33.020
<v Speaker 2>slick and fast and can do awkward things,</v>

1053
00:31:33.180 --> 00:31:33.501
<v Speaker 2>tussle,</v>

1054
00:31:33.501 --> 00:31:34.334
<v Speaker 2>awkward fight for him.</v>

1055
00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:36.980
<v Speaker 2>He could have picked more cheesier opponents</v>

1056
00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:41.840
<v Speaker 2>on May similar money bolt.</v>

1057
00:31:41.930 --> 00:31:42.763
<v Speaker 2>He didn't,</v>

1058
00:31:42.770 --> 00:31:43.940
<v Speaker 2>he opted for the toughest one.</v>

1059
00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:44.190
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1060
00:31:44.190 --> 00:31:47.810
<v Speaker 2>still could test our respect him for that and I take me out off to him.</v>

1061
00:31:48.590 --> 00:31:48.771
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1062
00:31:48.771 --> 00:31:50.360
<v Speaker 1>I think this is going to be a giant fight.</v>

1063
00:31:50.390 --> 00:31:53.570
<v Speaker 1>I really do because this is what everybody's been wanting for a long time.</v>

1064
00:31:53.571 --> 00:31:56.420
<v Speaker 1>It's so difficult to get people excited about the heavyweight division.</v>

1065
00:31:56.630 --> 00:31:56.781
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1066
00:31:56.781 --> 00:31:58.730
<v Speaker 1>Joshua was a giant fan in the UK,</v>

1067
00:31:58.731 --> 00:31:59.840
<v Speaker 1>but worldwide,</v>

1068
00:31:59.900 --> 00:32:00.591
<v Speaker 1>not so much.</v>

1069
00:32:00.591 --> 00:32:01.250
<v Speaker 1>Not so much.</v>

1070
00:32:01.250 --> 00:32:02.480
<v Speaker 1>And Deontay wilder,</v>

1071
00:32:02.481 --> 00:32:04.430
<v Speaker 1>even though he's had these spectacular results,</v>

1072
00:32:04.431 --> 00:32:06.990
<v Speaker 1>he needs that big thing too.</v>

1073
00:32:07.100 --> 00:32:08.270
<v Speaker 1>To put him over the top.</v>

1074
00:32:08.271 --> 00:32:09.560
<v Speaker 1>The Ortiz fight helped,</v>

1075
00:32:09.860 --> 00:32:11.670
<v Speaker 1>but he needs something more to,</v>

1076
00:32:11.671 --> 00:32:13.430
<v Speaker 1>to capture the real,</v>

1077
00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:14.091
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1078
00:32:14.091 --> 00:32:14.311
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1079
00:32:14.311 --> 00:32:16.010
<v Speaker 1>the love of the American public,</v>

1080
00:32:16.011 --> 00:32:17.120
<v Speaker 1>the love of the world.</v>

1081
00:32:17.121 --> 00:32:19.340
<v Speaker 1>He just hasn't quite grabbed it yet.</v>

1082
00:32:19.530 --> 00:32:20.430
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] on.</v>

1083
00:32:20.530 --> 00:32:22.000
<v Speaker 2>I do feel sorry for him in a way,</v>

1084
00:32:22.001 --> 00:32:25.840
<v Speaker 2>because he has had for two professional fights and knocked out nearly</v>

1085
00:32:25.841 --> 00:32:26.880
<v Speaker 2>everybody's calls.</v>

1086
00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:28.750
<v Speaker 2>He should be a huge superstar.</v>

1087
00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:29.111
<v Speaker 2>Shouldn't be,</v>

1088
00:32:29.111 --> 00:32:29.740
<v Speaker 2>but he's not.</v>

1089
00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:30.910
<v Speaker 2>I go down the street,</v>

1090
00:32:31.210 --> 00:32:31.661
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

1091
00:32:31.661 --> 00:32:31.931
<v Speaker 2>I am,</v>

1092
00:32:31.931 --> 00:32:32.561
<v Speaker 2>New York,</v>

1093
00:32:32.561 --> 00:32:33.341
<v Speaker 2>Los Angeles,</v>

1094
00:32:33.341 --> 00:32:34.174
<v Speaker 2>big bear.</v>

1095
00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:36.730
<v Speaker 2>And if I have 50 people whose Deontay wilder,</v>

1096
00:32:37.330 --> 00:32:39.260
<v Speaker 2>maybe one might even recognize the name.</v>

1097
00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:40.520
<v Speaker 2>And someone even said,</v>

1098
00:32:40.521 --> 00:32:41.301
<v Speaker 2>I recognize the name.</v>

1099
00:32:41.301 --> 00:32:42.160
<v Speaker 2>Is he a ballplayer?</v>

1100
00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:43.550
<v Speaker 2>Is he a hockey player?</v>

1101
00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:44.181
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

1102
00:32:44.181 --> 00:32:44.331
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1103
00:32:44.331 --> 00:32:45.890
<v Speaker 2>he's heavyweight champion of the world.</v>

1104
00:32:45.980 --> 00:32:48.410
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy because he's a flashy dresser.</v>

1105
00:32:48.411 --> 00:32:49.730
<v Speaker 2>He's a great talker.</v>

1106
00:32:49.731 --> 00:32:52.310
<v Speaker 2>He knocks people and do another fucking dimension.</v>

1107
00:32:52.311 --> 00:32:54.050
<v Speaker 2>He's a wild guy to watch fight.</v>

1108
00:32:54.051 --> 00:32:55.310
<v Speaker 2>He's very exciting.</v>

1109
00:32:56.080 --> 00:32:56.450
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

1110
00:32:56.450 --> 00:32:57.290
<v Speaker 2>he's got all the,</v>

1111
00:32:57.580 --> 00:32:57.950
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>

1112
00:32:57.950 --> 00:32:59.600
<v Speaker 2>he's just waiting for the big moment.</v>

1113
00:32:59.630 --> 00:33:02.690
<v Speaker 2>And maybe this fight is the big moment for one of you.</v>

1114
00:33:03.610 --> 00:33:04.350
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

1115
00:33:04.350 --> 00:33:05.183
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1116
00:33:06.610 --> 00:33:09.620
<v Speaker 2>they think it's so much to do with the heavyweight division's been in Europe for</v>

1117
00:33:09.621 --> 00:33:13.040
<v Speaker 2>the last 15 years and been put to sleep.</v>

1118
00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:14.360
<v Speaker 2>I believe that too.</v>

1119
00:33:14.630 --> 00:33:17.390
<v Speaker 2>The thing about Klitschko is even though he was very,</v>

1120
00:33:17.391 --> 00:33:21.980
<v Speaker 2>very successful and his style was amazing in terms of his success rate,</v>

1121
00:33:22.350 --> 00:33:22.971
<v Speaker 2>God damn,</v>

1122
00:33:22.971 --> 00:33:24.170
<v Speaker 2>those fights were born to watch.</v>

1123
00:33:24.171 --> 00:33:25.910
<v Speaker 2>Nobody gave a shit about those fights.</v>

1124
00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:26.361
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1125
00:33:26.361 --> 00:33:27.200
<v Speaker 2>Outside Europe,</v>

1126
00:33:27.470 --> 00:33:28.303
<v Speaker 2>Germany,</v>

<v Speaker 2>global phenomenon.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1129
00:33:29.751 --> 00:33:31.240
<v Speaker 2>they were just happy lived in Germany,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1135
00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:36.970
<v Speaker 2>it was a,</v>

1136
00:33:36.970 --> 00:33:38.990
<v Speaker 2>a wonderful investment for him.</v>

1137
00:33:38.991 --> 00:33:39.570
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1138
00:33:39.570 --> 00:33:40.850
<v Speaker 2>no disrespect to him.</v>

1139
00:33:40.851 --> 00:33:42.230
<v Speaker 2>He's a great boxer for sure.</v>

1140
00:33:42.231 --> 00:33:43.064
<v Speaker 2>But</v>

1141
00:33:44.060 --> 00:33:44.870
<v Speaker 2>boxing is,</v>

1142
00:33:44.870 --> 00:33:47.810
<v Speaker 2>it's entertainment as well as sport,</v>

1143
00:33:47.811 --> 00:33:49.550
<v Speaker 2>especially for the casual person.</v>

1144
00:33:50.030 --> 00:33:50.271
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1145
00:33:50.271 --> 00:33:50.571
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1146
00:33:50.571 --> 00:33:50.750

1149
00:33:51.950 --> 00:33:52.550
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1150
00:33:52.550 --> 00:33:53.720
<v Speaker 2>great boxer,</v>

1151
00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:54.320
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

1152
00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:54.890
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

1153
00:33:54.890 --> 00:33:55.251
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1154
00:33:55.251 --> 00:33:57.650
<v Speaker 2>box well and play it safe,</v>

1155
00:33:57.830 --> 00:33:59.330
<v Speaker 2>I can be very impressed with that.</v>

1156
00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:02.000
<v Speaker 2>But the average person is not going to be impressed.</v>

1157
00:34:02.001 --> 00:34:04.070
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to get some paper view dollars,</v>

1158
00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:05.513
<v Speaker 2>hundred percent of them.</v>

1159
00:34:05.990 --> 00:34:08.390
<v Speaker 2>I can't sit here and pretend to most,</v>

1160
00:34:08.391 --> 00:34:11.870
<v Speaker 2>some of my fights have been the most exciting fights in the wild becomes my</v>

1161
00:34:11.871 --> 00:34:15.770
<v Speaker 2>biggest fight of my whole Korea was a 12 round snooze fest.</v>

1162
00:34:16.390 --> 00:34:16.610
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1163
00:34:16.610 --> 00:34:16.901
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1164
00:34:16.901 --> 00:34:17.810
<v Speaker 2>I don't have to say that.</v>

1165
00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:19.481
<v Speaker 2>Hi,</v>

1166
00:34:19.481 --> 00:34:22.190
<v Speaker 2>I'm amount of Avala and I will tell you the truth.</v>

1167
00:34:22.580 --> 00:34:24.050
<v Speaker 2>I can't even watch a fight back.</v>

1168
00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:24.741
<v Speaker 2>It was all boring.</v>

1169
00:34:24.741 --> 00:34:25.610
<v Speaker 2>It didn't think it was Bob.</v>

1170
00:34:25.670 --> 00:34:30.320
<v Speaker 2>He was to box in people who know boxing to know hard while I was doing is to do</v>

1171
00:34:30.350 --> 00:34:32.340
<v Speaker 2>as a heavyweight and the scale and all that.</v>

1172
00:34:32.390 --> 00:34:36.410
<v Speaker 2>But like you say to the average Joe who knows nothing about box and he wants to</v>

1173
00:34:36.411 --> 00:34:38.480
<v Speaker 2>see two big men punch the shit out of each other.</v>

1174
00:34:38.870 --> 00:34:40.940
<v Speaker 2>It was a boring fight to,</v>

1175
00:34:40.941 --> 00:34:43.570
<v Speaker 2>that's why Joshua gets more credit for each.</v>

1176
00:34:43.571 --> 00:34:46.340
<v Speaker 2>Went over Klitschko even though he got popped down and really knocked out than I</v>

1177
00:34:46.341 --> 00:34:46.850
<v Speaker 2>did.</v>

1178
00:34:46.850 --> 00:34:50.370
<v Speaker 2>And Klitschko didn't love the glove on me because their fight was 50 50 I knew</v>

1179
00:34:50.380 --> 00:34:51.770
<v Speaker 2>it was locking arms off each other,</v>

1180
00:34:51.771 --> 00:34:55.460
<v Speaker 2>but my fight was like 80 20 in my favor where I didn't get torched.</v>

1181
00:34:55.850 --> 00:34:57.770
<v Speaker 2>But that still was spectacular.</v>

1182
00:34:58.370 --> 00:35:00.980
<v Speaker 2>He was watching it as a fight fan.</v>

1183
00:35:01.010 --> 00:35:01.581
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

1184
00:35:01.581 --> 00:35:05.390
<v Speaker 2>it was no disrespect to Klitschko but it was like finally,</v>

1185
00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:09.770
<v Speaker 2>finally somebody figured this dude out because there had been moments where</v>

1186
00:35:09.771 --> 00:35:10.340
<v Speaker 2>people had,</v>

1187
00:35:10.340 --> 00:35:10.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1188
00:35:10.790 --> 00:35:11.900
<v Speaker 2>tested him a little bit,</v>

1189
00:35:11.901 --> 00:35:14.810
<v Speaker 2>but it had been a long time before somebody had beaten him.</v>

1190
00:35:15.050 --> 00:35:15.501
<v Speaker 2>It don't,</v>

1191
00:35:15.501 --> 00:35:16.850
<v Speaker 2>it had been there 11 years.</v>

1192
00:35:16.970 --> 00:35:17.803
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1193
00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:20.780
<v Speaker 2>but that isn't always been my style.</v>

1194
00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:21.860
<v Speaker 2>Boxing on the back foot,</v>

1195
00:35:21.861 --> 00:35:22.510
<v Speaker 2>slip and slide,</v>

1196
00:35:22.510 --> 00:35:24.950
<v Speaker 2>I'm adjust to different opponents loud to me,</v>

1197
00:35:24.951 --> 00:35:28.460
<v Speaker 2>I'd dynamite in his right hand regardless of his boring style or whatever.</v>

1198
00:35:28.820 --> 00:35:32.600
<v Speaker 2>If he made a mistake once in that fight you get knocked out.</v>

1199
00:35:33.410 --> 00:35:34.520
<v Speaker 2>Eddie Chambers,</v>

1200
00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:37.470
<v Speaker 2>so many Samuel Peters,</v>

1201
00:35:38.790 --> 00:35:41.100
<v Speaker 2>everybody list goes on and on and on and on.</v>

1202
00:35:41.130 --> 00:35:44.810
<v Speaker 2>Everybody knocked out 65 knockouts and he would make you desperate because of</v>

1203
00:35:44.811 --> 00:35:47.090
<v Speaker 2>that style cause that grab,</v>

1204
00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:48.690
<v Speaker 2>Jab and grab style.</v>

1205
00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:51.290
<v Speaker 2>People would get desperate and they would open themselves up and then getting</v>

1206
00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:54.880
<v Speaker 2>out toe and I didn't want to be on that list of knockouts bought.</v>

1207
00:35:55.710 --> 00:35:56.160
<v Speaker 2>I've been,</v>

1208
00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:59.550
<v Speaker 2>I've been in fights where he's been total walls for as long as the fight lasted.</v>

1209
00:35:59.810 --> 00:36:00.180
<v Speaker 2>Aida,</v>

1210
00:36:00.180 --> 00:36:04.320
<v Speaker 2>Steve Calling on fight 2013 I'll come out here or come from Iran or straight</v>

1211
00:36:04.321 --> 00:36:05.010
<v Speaker 2>onto an overrun,</v>

1212
00:36:05.010 --> 00:36:06.150
<v Speaker 2>right and down.</v>

1213
00:36:06.510 --> 00:36:10.280
<v Speaker 2>I was looking enough up Mallesons glad God and roof the lights and the off 12</v>

1214
00:36:10.290 --> 00:36:10.801
<v Speaker 2>fuck me.</v>

1215
00:36:10.801 --> 00:36:12.030
<v Speaker 2>It's now back to the farm boy.</v>

1216
00:36:12.031 --> 00:36:12.864
<v Speaker 2>Get up.</v>

1217
00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:14.190
<v Speaker 2>What's Cunningham?</v>

1218
00:36:14.191 --> 00:36:17.640
<v Speaker 2>A difficult opponent because he was shorter than you calling them.</v>

1219
00:36:18.050 --> 00:36:20.100
<v Speaker 2>Believe it or not in this going to sound strange.</v>

1220
00:36:20.460 --> 00:36:22.620
<v Speaker 2>Calling him was the hardest fight I ever did.</v>

1221
00:36:22.621 --> 00:36:24.930
<v Speaker 2>Have a whole Korea amateur or professional.</v>

1222
00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:29.520
<v Speaker 2>The reason B and he was very slippery the way I explained calling them.</v>

1223
00:36:29.521 --> 00:36:32.280
<v Speaker 2>It was like a Conga real all full of oil in front of me.</v>

1224
00:36:32.670 --> 00:36:33.570
<v Speaker 2>I can pin him down.</v>

1225
00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:35.040
<v Speaker 2>He was light on his feet.</v>

1226
00:36:35.041 --> 00:36:37.480
<v Speaker 2>He was weighing 208 pounds or something Peyser way,</v>

1227
00:36:37.481 --> 00:36:37.830
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1228
00:36:37.830 --> 00:36:38.550
<v Speaker 2>He was a,</v>

1229
00:36:38.550 --> 00:36:40.110
<v Speaker 2>he was a three time cruiserweight champ,</v>

1230
00:36:40.111 --> 00:36:41.880
<v Speaker 2>middle the world and he stepped up into heavyweights.</v>

1231
00:36:42.450 --> 00:36:43.320
<v Speaker 2>He was a slick,</v>

1232
00:36:44.070 --> 00:36:46.110
<v Speaker 2>talented boxer and I,</v>

1233
00:36:46.111 --> 00:36:47.220
<v Speaker 2>I tried to walk him down,</v>

1234
00:36:47.221 --> 00:36:48.510
<v Speaker 2>use me size and power,</v>

1235
00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:50.100
<v Speaker 2>but he's just out box in me.</v>

1236
00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:50.761
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

1237
00:36:50.761 --> 00:36:51.594
<v Speaker 2>I'm good at.</v>

1238
00:36:51.690 --> 00:36:52.610
<v Speaker 2>Boxing move in,</v>

1239
00:36:52.620 --> 00:36:53.520
<v Speaker 2>slipping and sliding.</v>

1240
00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:56.820
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't do against Dave couldn't come because he was too,</v>

1241
00:36:56.940 --> 00:36:57.900
<v Speaker 2>he was quicker than me.</v>

1242
00:36:58.290 --> 00:36:58.590
<v Speaker 2>He was,</v>

1243
00:36:58.590 --> 00:36:59.423
<v Speaker 2>he was,</v>

1244
00:36:59.460 --> 00:36:59.941
<v Speaker 2>he was like,</v>

1245
00:36:59.941 --> 00:37:01.440
<v Speaker 2>it was a better boxer all around to me.</v>

1246
00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:04.230
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't do nothing with him and he'd knocked me over and even though he was a</v>

1247
00:37:04.231 --> 00:37:06.450
<v Speaker 2>light punch her supposedly what?</v>

1248
00:37:06.451 --> 00:37:08.040
<v Speaker 2>Right onto it come from the back of the hole.</v>

1249
00:37:08.041 --> 00:37:11.090
<v Speaker 2>They go over and write right in the Chin and the fall,</v>

1250
00:37:11.750 --> 00:37:13.980
<v Speaker 2>this has hit us day B have been knocked out.</v>

1251
00:37:15.570 --> 00:37:16.500
<v Speaker 2>I fought Tyson theory,</v>

1252
00:37:16.501 --> 00:37:18.390
<v Speaker 2>get up and kick his ass.</v>

1253
00:37:18.630 --> 00:37:22.340
<v Speaker 2>So I got up and I just went straight forward our team and I thought no mailbox</v>

1254
00:37:22.370 --> 00:37:24.120
<v Speaker 2>and now I'm going to hit him around in the body,</v>

1255
00:37:24.121 --> 00:37:24.960
<v Speaker 2>pull them up through the middle,</v>

1256
00:37:24.980 --> 00:37:25.890
<v Speaker 2>rounder corners.</v>

1257
00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:28.890
<v Speaker 2>You might be ahead on points but sooner or later I'm going to get you.</v>

1258
00:37:29.490 --> 00:37:30.870
<v Speaker 2>And I did in round seven.</v>

1259
00:37:30.871 --> 00:37:33.600
<v Speaker 2>I felt him going week cause I was just pushing him back,</v>

1260
00:37:33.601 --> 00:37:36.120
<v Speaker 2>pushing him back and he's hitting me gloves and hitting me face and hit me</v>

1261
00:37:36.121 --> 00:37:37.050
<v Speaker 2>everywhere basically.</v>

1262
00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:40.050
<v Speaker 2>But I walked right through everything when regard up.</v>

1263
00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:40.800
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1264
00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:44.490
<v Speaker 2>after he got tired I am of a heavy body shot and round seven and he didn't</v>

1265
00:37:44.491 --> 00:37:46.920
<v Speaker 2>recover an had pushed his head back and knocked him clean out with the right</v>

1266
00:37:46.921 --> 00:37:47.610
<v Speaker 2>talent.</v>

1267
00:37:47.610 --> 00:37:49.590
<v Speaker 2>That was the only time he was ever knocked out when his career,</v>

1268
00:37:50.070 --> 00:37:50.903
<v Speaker 2>even to today,</v>

1269
00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:52.740
<v Speaker 2>it seemed like in that fight,</v>

1270
00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:56.490
<v Speaker 2>perhaps one of the more difficult things was adjusting to the fact that he was</v>

1271
00:37:56.491 --> 00:37:57.570
<v Speaker 2>so much smaller than you.</v>

1272
00:37:57.720 --> 00:37:58.081
<v Speaker 2>Six,</v>

1273
00:37:58.081 --> 00:37:59.070
<v Speaker 2>six 43 was,</v>

1274
00:37:59.071 --> 00:37:59.490
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1275
00:37:59.490 --> 00:38:00.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1276
00:38:00.020 --> 00:38:03.600
<v Speaker 2>Didn't you were just took you a while to adjust to that.</v>

1277
00:38:04.470 --> 00:38:05.130
<v Speaker 2>Like I say,</v>

1278
00:38:05.130 --> 00:38:06.720
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to make any excuses.</v>

1279
00:38:07.260 --> 00:38:09.150
<v Speaker 2>Steve Conning and was a better boxer at American.</v>

1280
00:38:09.170 --> 00:38:09.800
<v Speaker 2>Good fighter.</v>

1281
00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:10.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1282
00:38:10.260 --> 00:38:12.210
<v Speaker 2>Small guy for the heavyweight division,</v>

1283
00:38:12.211 --> 00:38:13.050
<v Speaker 2>but a very good fighter.</v>

1284
00:38:13.170 --> 00:38:14.003
<v Speaker 2>Very good.</v>

1285
00:38:14.340 --> 00:38:14.840
<v Speaker 2>Like I said,</v>

1286
00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:16.740
<v Speaker 2>the toughest money ever face was still calling them.</v>

1287
00:38:17.610 --> 00:38:19.080
<v Speaker 2>That's a high praise.</v>

1288
00:38:19.350 --> 00:38:23.820
<v Speaker 2>So when you decided that you were going to make this comeback and you're dealing</v>

1289
00:38:23.821 --> 00:38:24.660
<v Speaker 2>with all this,</v>

1290
00:38:24.750 --> 00:38:26.130
<v Speaker 2>these mental health struggles,</v>

1291
00:38:26.340 --> 00:38:29.430
<v Speaker 2>what did you do to overcome the mental health problems?</v>

1292
00:38:29.431 --> 00:38:31.350
<v Speaker 2>What did you do to overcome the depression?</v>

1293
00:38:32.100 --> 00:38:32.701
<v Speaker 2>Like I say,</v>

1294
00:38:32.701 --> 00:38:36.520
<v Speaker 2>when I got up off that floor and a weight lifted off me and I had my mind set</v>

1295
00:38:36.521 --> 00:38:39.640
<v Speaker 2>for the first time in two years till I wanted to do something again.</v>

1296
00:38:40.450 --> 00:38:43.270
<v Speaker 2>I think the way to beat mental health has setting goals,</v>

1297
00:38:43.271 --> 00:38:45.670
<v Speaker 2>giving yourself short term or long term goals.</v>

1298
00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:47.140
<v Speaker 2>And that's what I did.</v>

1299
00:38:47.230 --> 00:38:48.310
<v Speaker 2>That's very interesting.</v>

1300
00:38:48.550 --> 00:38:51.220
<v Speaker 2>I give myself a goal of losing the weight,</v>

1301
00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:54.700
<v Speaker 2>pound by pound.</v>

1302
00:38:54.701 --> 00:38:55.534
<v Speaker 2>Basically.</v>

1303
00:38:55.540 --> 00:38:56.980
<v Speaker 2>I'll set myself a 10 pound,</v>

1304
00:38:57.610 --> 00:38:58.000
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1305
00:38:58.000 --> 00:38:59.340
<v Speaker 2>target and I'd reached out and,</v>

1306
00:38:59.341 --> 00:39:00.520
<v Speaker 2>and I sent myself and have a 10 pound,</v>

1307
00:39:00.521 --> 00:39:01.450
<v Speaker 2>15 pound whatever,</v>

1308
00:39:02.150 --> 00:39:04.210
<v Speaker 2>and I'd give myself a little rewards and stuff.</v>

1309
00:39:04.330 --> 00:39:06.010
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't obviously eating junk food.</v>

1310
00:39:06.070 --> 00:39:10.660
<v Speaker 2>I was on a strict diet for six months and I was training twice a day,</v>

1311
00:39:10.661 --> 00:39:10.961
<v Speaker 2>six,</v>

1312
00:39:10.961 --> 00:39:11.830
<v Speaker 2>seven days a week.</v>

1313
00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:14.890
<v Speaker 2>But with the mental health,</v>

1314
00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:18.280
<v Speaker 2>I don't suffer with mental health when I'm active one,</v>

1315
00:39:18.281 --> 00:39:19.114
<v Speaker 2>I've got a goal.</v>

1316
00:39:19.820 --> 00:39:22.270
<v Speaker 2>How do I think most people will vouch for this?</v>

1317
00:39:22.810 --> 00:39:24.430
<v Speaker 2>If you suffer with mental health problems,</v>

1318
00:39:24.431 --> 00:39:26.110
<v Speaker 2>you tend to suffer on when you're on your own,</v>

1319
00:39:26.170 --> 00:39:29.530
<v Speaker 2>when you've got a lot of time to think and when you're not doing much.</v>

1320
00:39:30.220 --> 00:39:31.810
<v Speaker 2>But when you busy on a daily basis,</v>

1321
00:39:31.811 --> 00:39:34.780
<v Speaker 2>you don't have enough time to think about mental health.</v>

1322
00:39:34.781 --> 00:39:36.370
<v Speaker 2>And I figured out,</v>

1323
00:39:36.610 --> 00:39:36.741
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1324
00:39:36.741 --> 00:39:38.320
<v Speaker 2>if I exhaust myself in the gym,</v>

1325
00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:39.360
<v Speaker 2>I come on,</v>

1326
00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:40.650
<v Speaker 2>I'm too tired to think about anything.</v>

1327
00:39:40.690 --> 00:39:42.100
<v Speaker 2>I just want to get some food and go to bed.</v>

1328
00:39:43.210 --> 00:39:44.080
<v Speaker 2>So that's what I do.</v>

1329
00:39:44.210 --> 00:39:46.430
<v Speaker 1>So you didn't use medication?</v>

1330
00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:47.920
<v Speaker 2>I didn't use medication,</v>

1331
00:39:47.921 --> 00:39:48.520
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1332
00:39:48.520 --> 00:39:49.000
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1333
00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:53.320
<v Speaker 2>I will say I was prescribed with medication from the doctor,</v>

1334
00:39:53.860 --> 00:39:55.180
<v Speaker 2>but I refuse to take it.</v>

1335
00:39:56.350 --> 00:39:57.490
<v Speaker 2>I took a couple of pills,</v>

1336
00:39:57.491 --> 00:39:58.070
<v Speaker 2>helped me software,</v>

1337
00:39:58.070 --> 00:39:58.903
<v Speaker 2>lax</v>

1338
00:40:00.280 --> 00:40:01.061
<v Speaker 2>from the doctor.</v>

1339
00:40:01.061 --> 00:40:01.960
<v Speaker 2>Bhat never took them again.</v>

1340
00:40:01.961 --> 00:40:02.920
<v Speaker 2>I only ever taco couple.</v>

1341
00:40:02.950 --> 00:40:03.783
<v Speaker 2>Would they give you,</v>

1342
00:40:04.010 --> 00:40:07.170
<v Speaker 2>I think it was like [inaudible] pan try Ozzie panel,</v>

1343
00:40:07.190 --> 00:40:07.761
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

1344
00:40:07.761 --> 00:40:08.720
<v Speaker 2>Some antidepressants,</v>

1345
00:40:08.730 --> 00:40:10.000
<v Speaker 2>some antidepressant pill.</v>

1346
00:40:10.001 --> 00:40:10.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1347
00:40:10.810 --> 00:40:13.270
<v Speaker 2>But I've done research on them and I didn't like what I was seeing.</v>

1348
00:40:13.990 --> 00:40:14.471
<v Speaker 2>Like on.</v>

1349
00:40:14.471 --> 00:40:16.120
<v Speaker 2>I knew my grandfather,</v>

1350
00:40:16.121 --> 00:40:16.954
<v Speaker 2>my dad's dad,</v>

1351
00:40:17.140 --> 00:40:19.030
<v Speaker 2>he was addicted to pills his whole life.</v>

1352
00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:21.100
<v Speaker 2>Pells that didn't even do anything for him.</v>

1353
00:40:21.101 --> 00:40:22.450
<v Speaker 2>There was placebo pills,</v>

1354
00:40:22.870 --> 00:40:25.090
<v Speaker 2>but without him he couldn't function really.</v>

1355
00:40:25.990 --> 00:40:30.970
<v Speaker 2>So I didn't want to become one of them macaron dough to take pills and they</v>

1356
00:40:30.971 --> 00:40:31.804
<v Speaker 2>didn't do anything to him.</v>

1357
00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:33.820
<v Speaker 2>Put it in his own mind.</v>

1358
00:40:33.821 --> 00:40:34.061
<v Speaker 2>He fought,</v>

1359
00:40:34.061 --> 00:40:37.180
<v Speaker 2>they were doing something calming him down and I didn't,</v>

1360
00:40:37.660 --> 00:40:38.860
<v Speaker 2>didn't want to be one of them people.</v>

1361
00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:44.260
<v Speaker 2>There was a point in my life where I haven't done hard fought.</v>

1362
00:40:44.470 --> 00:40:45.820
<v Speaker 2>I was gonna end up in a padded room.</v>

1363
00:40:49.370 --> 00:40:50.250
<v Speaker 1>Lots of body was.</v>

1364
00:40:50.280 --> 00:40:54.930
<v Speaker 1>But it's fascinating that you're saying that setting goals and setting your mind</v>

1365
00:40:54.931 --> 00:40:58.800
<v Speaker 1>on things and hard training is what set you back on track.</v>

1366
00:40:58.970 --> 00:40:59.311
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1367
00:40:59.311 --> 00:41:01.920
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what you're like when there's no one in front of you,</v>

1368
00:41:01.921 --> 00:41:03.480
<v Speaker 1>but standing here in front of you right now,</v>

1369
00:41:03.660 --> 00:41:05.040
<v Speaker 1>I would say this is a healthy,</v>

1370
00:41:05.041 --> 00:41:06.030
<v Speaker 1>vibrant guy.</v>

1371
00:41:06.090 --> 00:41:07.780
<v Speaker 2>100% I've never felt better,</v>

1372
00:41:07.810 --> 00:41:09.670
<v Speaker 2>mentally strong physically.</v>

1373
00:41:09.730 --> 00:41:10.900
<v Speaker 2>I've trained in hard fail,</v>

1374
00:41:10.990 --> 00:41:11.830
<v Speaker 2>fit as a fiddle.</v>

1375
00:41:11.980 --> 00:41:12.620
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1376
00:41:12.620 --> 00:41:15.070
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't be here if I was anything wrong with me,</v>

1377
00:41:15.170 --> 00:41:19.130
<v Speaker 1>but as fascinating that most people think that to come back from a mental health</v>

1378
00:41:19.131 --> 00:41:20.090
<v Speaker 1>issue like yours,</v>

1379
00:41:20.300 --> 00:41:23.480
<v Speaker 1>you need psychiatric care and you need medication.</v>

1380
00:41:23.750 --> 00:41:27.320
<v Speaker 1>And your saying you did it with setting goals and hard work.</v>

1381
00:41:27.810 --> 00:41:30.630
<v Speaker 2>And the biggest thing we're missing here is I didn't,</v>

1382
00:41:30.690 --> 00:41:31.231
<v Speaker 2>I didn't do it.</v>

1383
00:41:31.231 --> 00:41:32.430
<v Speaker 2>We're doctors and um,</v>

1384
00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:33.860
<v Speaker 2>all of type of things,</v>

1385
00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:34.881
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1386
00:41:34.881 --> 00:41:36.350
<v Speaker 2>It was something way more powerful.</v>

1387
00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:37.753
<v Speaker 2>God.</v>

1388
00:41:38.090 --> 00:41:39.830
<v Speaker 2>So your faith and your belief,</v>

1389
00:41:39.980 --> 00:41:40.191
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>

1390
00:41:40.191 --> 00:41:43.460
<v Speaker 2>faith and belief that God would make me better made me better.</v>

1391
00:41:45.020 --> 00:41:46.210
<v Speaker 2>Almost like faith.</v>

1392
00:41:46.830 --> 00:41:47.840
<v Speaker 2>Any faith will think,</v>

1393
00:41:47.870 --> 00:41:48.051
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1394
00:41:48.051 --> 00:41:49.730
<v Speaker 2>is this nonsense or whatever book.</v>

1395
00:41:50.420 --> 00:41:51.280
<v Speaker 2>I'm living proof.</v>

1396
00:41:51.281 --> 00:41:54.830
<v Speaker 2>Well if you believe in something and just like you were talking about believing</v>

1397
00:41:54.831 --> 00:41:56.300
<v Speaker 2>in pills that don't do anything,</v>

1398
00:41:56.540 --> 00:41:57.920
<v Speaker 2>belief is a powerful thing.</v>

1399
00:41:58.330 --> 00:41:59.030
<v Speaker 2>Whether it,</v>

1400
00:41:59.030 --> 00:42:00.590
<v Speaker 2>who knows what's behind that belief.</v>

1401
00:42:00.591 --> 00:42:05.591
<v Speaker 2>But what you're saying is so powerful that you just by virtue of changing the</v>

1402
00:42:06.201 --> 00:42:07.610
<v Speaker 2>way you think about things,</v>

1403
00:42:07.850 --> 00:42:08.990
<v Speaker 2>setting goals,</v>

1404
00:42:09.170 --> 00:42:10.130
<v Speaker 2>working hard,</v>

1405
00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:14.480
<v Speaker 2>you lifted yourself out of the worst depression of your life to the point where</v>

1406
00:42:14.481 --> 00:42:15.440
<v Speaker 2>you were suicidal.</v>

1407
00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:16.953
<v Speaker 2>Hundred percent.</v>

1408
00:42:17.350 --> 00:42:21.260
<v Speaker 2>And I've never ever went back to that from this data out and it's been been one</v>

1409
00:42:21.261 --> 00:42:22.280
<v Speaker 2>over 12 months.</v>

1410
00:42:22.550 --> 00:42:23.540
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty amazing.</v>

1411
00:42:23.541 --> 00:42:24.374
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's just amazing.</v>

1412
00:42:24.470 --> 00:42:27.950
<v Speaker 2>That's an amazing thing for people to hear because there's a lot of people that</v>

1413
00:42:27.951 --> 00:42:31.390
<v Speaker 2>rely heavily on antidepressants and medication.</v>

1414
00:42:31.430 --> 00:42:36.350
<v Speaker 2>They think that is the only way for them to be happy and for them to be not</v>

1415
00:42:36.351 --> 00:42:36.951
<v Speaker 2>suicidal,</v>

1416
00:42:36.951 --> 00:42:37.641
<v Speaker 2>not depressed.</v>

1417
00:42:37.641 --> 00:42:39.140
<v Speaker 2>They need that medication.</v>

1418
00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:43.760
<v Speaker 2>And for them to hear what your saying I think is a very powerful thing.</v>

1419
00:42:44.870 --> 00:42:45.650
<v Speaker 2>It is bull.</v>

1420
00:42:45.650 --> 00:42:46.483
<v Speaker 2>I'm no doctor.</v>

1421
00:42:46.490 --> 00:42:50.180
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to tell people to chuck away your pills and right,</v>

1422
00:42:51.220 --> 00:42:52.610
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't do any arm.</v>

1423
00:42:52.611 --> 00:42:53.241
<v Speaker 2>What I'm saying?</v>

1424
00:42:53.241 --> 00:42:54.074
<v Speaker 2>Give it a whirl.</v>

1425
00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:55.111
<v Speaker 2>Give it a try.</v>

1426
00:42:55.111 --> 00:42:55.701
<v Speaker 2>It can't hurt.</v>

1427
00:42:55.701 --> 00:42:56.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1428
00:42:56.100 --> 00:42:57.380
<v Speaker 2>set yourself some goals.</v>

1429
00:42:57.560 --> 00:43:00.620
<v Speaker 2>Think positive and a crack on Derby at training.</v>

1430
00:43:00.740 --> 00:43:01.573
<v Speaker 2>So from,</v>

1431
00:43:01.850 --> 00:43:04.130
<v Speaker 2>from accomplishing your ultimate goal,</v>

1432
00:43:04.190 --> 00:43:05.390
<v Speaker 2>beating Klitschko,</v>

1433
00:43:05.630 --> 00:43:09.350
<v Speaker 2>becoming the heavyweight champion and then falling into this deep funk,</v>

1434
00:43:09.830 --> 00:43:12.560
<v Speaker 2>do you think you had to go through all this to come back again?</v>

1435
00:43:13.070 --> 00:43:13.521
<v Speaker 2>I think so,</v>

1436
00:43:13.521 --> 00:43:14.354
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1437
00:43:14.840 --> 00:43:18.300
<v Speaker 2>I believe I was being tested to see what type of motto.</v>

1438
00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:19.100
<v Speaker 2>Awesome.</v>

1439
00:43:19.100 --> 00:43:20.300
<v Speaker 2>What type of character I out.</v>

1440
00:43:20.780 --> 00:43:21.613
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1441
00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:24.530
<v Speaker 2>even before the depression I didn't appreciate things,</v>

1442
00:43:25.070 --> 00:43:25.490
<v Speaker 2>nothing,</v>

1443
00:43:25.490 --> 00:43:26.690
<v Speaker 2>nothing was value to me.</v>

1444
00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:27.951
<v Speaker 2>So even swimming,</v>

1445
00:43:27.951 --> 00:43:28.401
<v Speaker 2>cad work,</v>

1446
00:43:28.401 --> 00:43:29.234
<v Speaker 2>Todd fall,</v>

1447
00:43:29.300 --> 00:43:31.670
<v Speaker 2>if I'd worked hard and saved up for a car,</v>

1448
00:43:31.910 --> 00:43:34.340
<v Speaker 2>just say for five minutes,</v>

1449
00:43:34.341 --> 00:43:36.040
<v Speaker 2>say blk but then I won't want anymore.</v>

1450
00:43:36.050 --> 00:43:36.890
<v Speaker 2>It was piece of shit.</v>

1451
00:43:38.300 --> 00:43:39.410
<v Speaker 2>So I know if it mattered to me,</v>

1452
00:43:39.411 --> 00:43:40.400
<v Speaker 2>I didn't value anything,</v>

1453
00:43:41.210 --> 00:43:46.210
<v Speaker 2>anything that I had and I've worked hard for and everyone knows like what I have</v>

1454
00:43:46.791 --> 00:43:51.590
<v Speaker 2>is blood money because I pay for him in face and their body gets punched to</v>

1455
00:43:51.591 --> 00:43:52.970
<v Speaker 2>pieces for what I have.</v>

1456
00:43:53.660 --> 00:43:56.120
<v Speaker 2>So you'd think I'd appreciate things more than an x mumble.</v>

1457
00:43:56.840 --> 00:43:57.920
<v Speaker 2>I didn't appreciate nothing.</v>

1458
00:43:57.980 --> 00:43:59.320
<v Speaker 2>I didn't appreciate anything,</v>

1459
00:43:59.330 --> 00:43:59.741
<v Speaker 2>anything a,</v>

1460
00:43:59.741 --> 00:44:02.510
<v Speaker 2>our daughter achieved even world championships.</v>

1461
00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:05.450
<v Speaker 2>Anything I thought is that it does this whole your whole life.</v>

1462
00:44:06.770 --> 00:44:08.890
<v Speaker 2>So I believe I was taught,</v>

1463
00:44:08.891 --> 00:44:11.690
<v Speaker 2>I was popped down this road and I had to suffer all these things so I could</v>

1464
00:44:11.691 --> 00:44:13.540
<v Speaker 2>understand one hour things.</v>

1465
00:44:13.550 --> 00:44:14.383
<v Speaker 2>God.</v>

1466
00:44:14.780 --> 00:44:18.750
<v Speaker 2>Like today I'm up here that I'm breathe in fresh air and the,</v>

1467
00:44:18.751 --> 00:44:18.970
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1468
00:44:18.970 --> 00:44:20.330
<v Speaker 2>I'm sat here in a mental,</v>

1469
00:44:20.390 --> 00:44:22.760
<v Speaker 2>mentally stable way of thinking.</v>

1470
00:44:23.450 --> 00:44:28.310
<v Speaker 2>I'm happy that I can go out and enjoy your dinner and just be normal,</v>

1471
00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:29.510
<v Speaker 2>whatever that is.</v>

1472
00:44:30.650 --> 00:44:31.740
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm up before.</v>

1473
00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:34.230
<v Speaker 2>I'm one of the most,</v>

1474
00:44:35.070 --> 00:44:37.110
<v Speaker 2>probably the most unique paypal's you'll ever meet.</v>

1475
00:44:37.170 --> 00:44:38.003
<v Speaker 2>I'm not.</v>

1476
00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:42.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm orientated by material things and all that sort of stuff means nothing to</v>

1477
00:44:42.241 --> 00:44:43.074
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

1478
00:44:43.140 --> 00:44:46.560
<v Speaker 2>I don't even care about glory and honor.</v>

1479
00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:48.450
<v Speaker 2>I don't care about legacies.</v>

1480
00:44:48.690 --> 00:44:51.780
<v Speaker 2>I don't care about winning titles or or,</v>

1481
00:44:51.781 --> 00:44:54.150
<v Speaker 2>or metals doesn't matter.</v>

1482
00:44:55.260 --> 00:44:57.090
<v Speaker 2>But when I set my mind to doing something,</v>

1483
00:44:57.330 --> 00:44:57.990
<v Speaker 2>I'll do it.</v>

1484
00:44:57.990 --> 00:45:01.140
<v Speaker 2>And every single time I've ever sent me mind to anything I've done it.</v>

1485
00:45:01.590 --> 00:45:04.950
<v Speaker 2>Even you'll thinkable things of a set your mind to,</v>

1486
00:45:04.951 --> 00:45:05.784
<v Speaker 2>I've done it.</v>

1487
00:45:05.970 --> 00:45:08.350
<v Speaker 2>I don't care about one in what Deontay wilder has,</v>

1488
00:45:08.351 --> 00:45:09.480
<v Speaker 2>it needs positional ever.</v>

1489
00:45:10.050 --> 00:45:11.220
<v Speaker 2>I only want to beat him in a fight.</v>

1490
00:45:11.250 --> 00:45:12.083
<v Speaker 2>Does it?</v>

1491
00:45:12.610 --> 00:45:15.210
<v Speaker 1>You only want to beat him because it's so difficult.</v>

1492
00:45:16.290 --> 00:45:16.921
<v Speaker 2>Not just that,</v>

1493
00:45:16.921 --> 00:45:17.980
<v Speaker 2>because that's what I want to do.</v>

1494
00:45:17.981 --> 00:45:18.091
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1495
00:45:18.091 --> 00:45:19.800
<v Speaker 2>what sets your soul set me goal?</v>

1496
00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:20.461
<v Speaker 2>Beaten.</v>

1497
00:45:20.461 --> 00:45:21.390
<v Speaker 2>Deontay wilder.</v>

1498
00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:22.680
<v Speaker 1>So do you think that that's the,</v>

1499
00:45:22.830 --> 00:45:26.500
<v Speaker 1>your future is just setting goals and constantly trying to achieve those goals?</v>

1500
00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:27.460
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

1501
00:45:27.460 --> 00:45:29.590
<v Speaker 2>I think I've got a bigger purpose now than boxing.</v>

1502
00:45:30.010 --> 00:45:31.500
<v Speaker 2>Boxing is a sport and some ankle.</v>

1503
00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:33.160
<v Speaker 2>I've made a living now for a long time,</v>

1504
00:45:34.240 --> 00:45:36.220
<v Speaker 2>but I think there's a bigger picture bigger than any,</v>

1505
00:45:36.221 --> 00:45:36.910
<v Speaker 2>any women,</v>

1506
00:45:36.910 --> 00:45:39.070
<v Speaker 2>any titles bigger than when in any,</v>

1507
00:45:39.130 --> 00:45:40.060
<v Speaker 2>any fights,</v>

1508
00:45:40.390 --> 00:45:41.560
<v Speaker 2>any number of fights.</v>

1509
00:45:42.040 --> 00:45:44.980
<v Speaker 2>I think my calling card in life has to spread the word on this.</v>

1510
00:45:45.130 --> 00:45:46.690
<v Speaker 2>This disease are silent killer.</v>

1511
00:45:47.270 --> 00:45:48.250
<v Speaker 2>I killed her.</v>

1512
00:45:48.251 --> 00:45:53.251
<v Speaker 2>That's so far Oceanus that you can't see it or feel it from the outside.</v>

1513
00:45:55.090 --> 00:45:56.800
<v Speaker 2>You could be suffering right now,</v>

1514
00:45:57.310 --> 00:45:59.860
<v Speaker 2>but I won't be able to see it because I can't see into your mind.</v>

1515
00:46:01.370 --> 00:46:04.940
<v Speaker 1>It's just so unusual that someone has that solution,</v>

1516
00:46:05.180 --> 00:46:06.140
<v Speaker 1>that hard work,</v>

1517
00:46:06.141 --> 00:46:10.100
<v Speaker 1>dedication and setting goals is what lifted you out of the depression and made</v>

1518
00:46:10.101 --> 00:46:13.730
<v Speaker 1>you appreciate life and made you appreciate all the,</v>

1519
00:46:13.731 --> 00:46:14.870
<v Speaker 1>all the aspects of it.</v>

1520
00:46:15.720 --> 00:46:16.140
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

1521
00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:17.100
<v Speaker 2>I appreciate everything.</v>

1522
00:46:17.130 --> 00:46:17.490
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1523
00:46:17.490 --> 00:46:18.780
<v Speaker 2>spending time with my family.</v>

1524
00:46:18.830 --> 00:46:21.690
<v Speaker 2>I took it for granted before for I spend nine when Tom went family.</v>

1525
00:46:21.691 --> 00:46:22.670
<v Speaker 2>Anytime a warm,</v>

1526
00:46:24.830 --> 00:46:28.500
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't put into words what I went through.</v>

1527
00:46:28.670 --> 00:46:28.811
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1528
00:46:28.811 --> 00:46:29.644
<v Speaker 2>let me just say,</v>

1529
00:46:30.090 --> 00:46:33.240
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't wish what I went through on my worst enemy.</v>

1530
00:46:33.300 --> 00:46:34.530
<v Speaker 2>Not that I have any enemies,</v>

1531
00:46:34.950 --> 00:46:35.820
<v Speaker 2>but if I did,</v>

1532
00:46:36.450 --> 00:46:39.720
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't wish on a soul because I know art is,</v>

1533
00:46:39.721 --> 00:46:41.550
<v Speaker 2>and I know unless a person,</v>

1534
00:46:41.790 --> 00:46:42.301
<v Speaker 2>maybe not,</v>

1535
00:46:42.301 --> 00:46:46.020
<v Speaker 2>I've got through or maybe not a man without faith may woulda took his own life.</v>

1536
00:46:46.840 --> 00:46:48.400
<v Speaker 1>Now that you have gotten through,</v>

1537
00:46:48.430 --> 00:46:51.880
<v Speaker 1>do you feel like you have the solution now to navigate the rest of your life?</v>

1538
00:46:51.960 --> 00:46:52.793
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1539
00:46:53.850 --> 00:46:56.850
<v Speaker 2>I now know the secret for me and everybody's will be different.</v>

1540
00:46:57.480 --> 00:46:59.700
<v Speaker 2>But if I train every day and I'm staying in shape,</v>

1541
00:47:00.080 --> 00:47:01.200
<v Speaker 2>then I'll be happy forever.</v>

1542
00:47:01.980 --> 00:47:05.880
<v Speaker 2>The time I stopped training the Tamar balloon back up again to tell him it all</v>

1543
00:47:05.881 --> 00:47:06.660
<v Speaker 2>goes wrong again.</v>

1544
00:47:06.660 --> 00:47:10.020
<v Speaker 2>And I know that if you know something in your life and you don't do it,</v>

1545
00:47:11.070 --> 00:47:11.903
<v Speaker 2>and that's what I know.</v>

1546
00:47:12.060 --> 00:47:13.290
<v Speaker 2>It's like a diabetic.</v>

1547
00:47:13.300 --> 00:47:14.550
<v Speaker 2>If he goes and eats a lot of sugar,</v>

1548
00:47:14.640 --> 00:47:16.350
<v Speaker 2>he knows he's going to make him out so we don't do it.</v>

1549
00:47:17.700 --> 00:47:20.250
<v Speaker 2>So as long as I always stay by them guidelines,</v>

1550
00:47:20.251 --> 00:47:21.320
<v Speaker 2>I know I'm going to be all right.</v>

1551
00:47:22.170 --> 00:47:22.741
<v Speaker 2>Not Sell Shit.</v>

1552
00:47:22.741 --> 00:47:22.860
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1553
00:47:22.860 --> 00:47:23.693
<v Speaker 2>He wrote</v>

1554
00:47:23.740 --> 00:47:26.020
<v Speaker 1>so as long as well that's the other thing too,</v>

1555
00:47:26.021 --> 00:47:26.321
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1556
00:47:26.321 --> 00:47:30.370
<v Speaker 1>The alcohol and the drugs exacerbate any sort of bad</v>

1557
00:47:30.370 --> 00:47:32.500
<v Speaker 2>state that you have because you're going to feel like shit.</v>

1558
00:47:32.980 --> 00:47:33.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1559
00:47:33.760 --> 00:47:34.810
<v Speaker 2>I'm not tee total.</v>

1560
00:47:35.050 --> 00:47:35.883
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1561
00:47:36.040 --> 00:47:37.630
<v Speaker 2>I've had a drink since I've been back.</v>

1562
00:47:37.631 --> 00:47:40.330
<v Speaker 2>I Bet I've been out with a large our drinks,</v>

1563
00:47:40.331 --> 00:47:41.164
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

1564
00:47:41.390 --> 00:47:42.223
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1565
00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:43.990
<v Speaker 2>but your goals are still set and strong.</v>

1566
00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:44.873
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1567
00:47:44.950 --> 00:47:46.510
<v Speaker 2>But really what it is.</v>

1568
00:47:46.540 --> 00:47:47.373
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1569
00:47:48.370 --> 00:47:49.300
<v Speaker 2>So from now on,</v>

1570
00:47:49.301 --> 00:47:51.610
<v Speaker 2>you just have to continue any set goals in your life,</v>

1571
00:47:51.730 --> 00:47:52.391
<v Speaker 2>set goals,</v>

1572
00:47:52.391 --> 00:47:53.350
<v Speaker 2>whatever those goals might be.</v>

1573
00:47:53.351 --> 00:47:55.570
<v Speaker 2>They don't have to be massive goals,</v>

1574
00:47:56.260 --> 00:47:58.270
<v Speaker 2>but they can be anything really.</v>

1575
00:47:58.300 --> 00:48:02.140
<v Speaker 2>Anything that I want to do or I want to achieve or I want to go someplace or</v>

1576
00:48:02.141 --> 00:48:02.950
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

1577
00:48:02.950 --> 00:48:04.990
<v Speaker 2>and I worked towards it and set myself a goal.</v>

1578
00:48:04.991 --> 00:48:06.700
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like a little treat or whatever.</v>

1579
00:48:07.060 --> 00:48:09.430
<v Speaker 2>It's fascinating because no one's ever really connected that.</v>

1580
00:48:09.431 --> 00:48:09.641
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1581
00:48:09.641 --> 00:48:09.881
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

1582
00:48:09.881 --> 00:48:13.390
<v Speaker 2>people have made that connection in terms of like when they study happy people,</v>

1583
00:48:13.540 --> 00:48:15.550
<v Speaker 2>one of the things they find about happy people's,</v>

1584
00:48:15.551 --> 00:48:17.080
<v Speaker 2>the goal oriented people,</v>

1585
00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:18.670
<v Speaker 2>they set goals to accomplish those people.</v>

1586
00:48:18.670 --> 00:48:23.670
<v Speaker 2>But nobody's ever really set that as a remedy for depression and for mental</v>

1587
00:48:24.611 --> 00:48:25.390
<v Speaker 2>health issues,</v>

1588
00:48:25.390 --> 00:48:26.050
<v Speaker 2>setting goals,</v>

1589
00:48:26.050 --> 00:48:26.980
<v Speaker 2>achieving those goals.</v>

1590
00:48:27.190 --> 00:48:28.450
<v Speaker 2>That's the key to keep it going.</v>

1591
00:48:29.260 --> 00:48:30.220
<v Speaker 2>I believe that's the case.</v>

1592
00:48:30.221 --> 00:48:30.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1593
00:48:30.700 --> 00:48:32.320
<v Speaker 2>After doing quite a lot of research on,</v>

1594
00:48:32.380 --> 00:48:37.380
<v Speaker 2>on myself and experiencing it and it works for me and I find it works for a lot</v>

1595
00:48:37.421 --> 00:48:39.790
<v Speaker 2>of people I speak to who's got the same problems.</v>

1596
00:48:40.270 --> 00:48:43.520
<v Speaker 2>I get messages from all all over the world from different types of sports people</v>

1597
00:48:43.521 --> 00:48:47.710
<v Speaker 2>and different types of people asking for information and help on how I,</v>

1598
00:48:47.760 --> 00:48:51.310
<v Speaker 2>I got free mine and what I did and I'm happy to,</v>

1599
00:48:51.311 --> 00:48:52.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm up here to help.</v>

1600
00:48:52.151 --> 00:48:54.610
<v Speaker 2>So if there's anybody out there who's struggling in silence,</v>

1601
00:48:54.611 --> 00:48:56.590
<v Speaker 2>which a lot of people are turned,</v>

1602
00:48:56.610 --> 00:48:58.060
<v Speaker 2>I'm always there to help if I can.</v>

1603
00:48:58.220 --> 00:48:58.400
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1604
00:48:58.400 --> 00:49:01.960
<v Speaker 2>it's such an impressive and inspiring message because you're doing it without</v>

1605
00:49:01.961 --> 00:49:02.740
<v Speaker 2>medication.</v>

1606
00:49:02.740 --> 00:49:05.200
<v Speaker 2>You're doing it just through positive thinking,</v>

1607
00:49:05.201 --> 00:49:07.330
<v Speaker 2>through goal setting and through healthy living.</v>

1608
00:49:07.750 --> 00:49:08.583
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

1609
00:49:08.620 --> 00:49:09.550
<v Speaker 2>And I believe it's the best,</v>

1610
00:49:09.551 --> 00:49:10.570
<v Speaker 2>best way to live anyway.</v>

1611
00:49:11.100 --> 00:49:12.640
<v Speaker 2>That's the way to live is fit and healthy.</v>

1612
00:49:13.180 --> 00:49:14.830
<v Speaker 2>When you're out of shape and you feel unfit.</v>

1613
00:49:14.831 --> 00:49:17.560
<v Speaker 2>And you feel terrible and nothing's going to go right for you.</v>

1614
00:49:17.561 --> 00:49:19.090
<v Speaker 2>But if you feel fit,</v>

1615
00:49:20.590 --> 00:49:21.423
<v Speaker 2>you feel good.</v>

1616
00:49:21.460 --> 00:49:25.810
<v Speaker 2>It's almost natural to feel depressed if your body is literally depressed.</v>

1617
00:49:26.230 --> 00:49:29.590
<v Speaker 2>If every time I go to the gym and do a little bit of training,</v>

1618
00:49:29.591 --> 00:49:30.880
<v Speaker 2>whether it be a lot more metal,</v>

1619
00:49:31.150 --> 00:49:33.340
<v Speaker 2>I always go out of a shower and I think I feel great.</v>

1620
00:49:33.341 --> 00:49:35.940
<v Speaker 2>Now training sets off an endorphin and you blow it.</v>

1621
00:49:35.941 --> 00:49:36.774
<v Speaker 2>It makes you happy.</v>

1622
00:49:37.660 --> 00:49:39.490
<v Speaker 2>Contentment is a word we're looking for.</v>

1623
00:49:39.910 --> 00:49:41.110
<v Speaker 2>Contentment doesn't come free.</v>

1624
00:49:41.111 --> 00:49:42.130
<v Speaker 2>Material stuff,</v>

1625
00:49:42.520 --> 00:49:43.360
<v Speaker 2>jobs,</v>

1626
00:49:43.570 --> 00:49:44.710
<v Speaker 2>positions,</v>

1627
00:49:44.770 --> 00:49:45.221
<v Speaker 2>fame,</v>

1628
00:49:45.221 --> 00:49:45.641
<v Speaker 2>glory,</v>

1629
00:49:45.641 --> 00:49:45.881
<v Speaker 2>money,</v>

1630
00:49:45.881 --> 00:49:46.540
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

1631
00:49:46.540 --> 00:49:47.030
<v Speaker 2>Content.</v>

1632
00:49:47.030 --> 00:49:48.760
<v Speaker 2>You'll never find a temp and while you're chasing,</v>

1633
00:49:48.761 --> 00:49:49.594
<v Speaker 2>and that's all stuff,</v>

1634
00:49:51.250 --> 00:49:52.390
<v Speaker 2>my message would be,</v>

1635
00:49:53.890 --> 00:49:57.070
<v Speaker 2>look around yourself and be thankful for what you do have today.</v>

1636
00:49:57.880 --> 00:49:59.350
<v Speaker 2>Don't look for what you don't have.</v>

1637
00:50:00.040 --> 00:50:00.490
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1638
00:50:00.490 --> 00:50:01.080
<v Speaker 2>you gotta be happy.</v>

1639
00:50:01.080 --> 00:50:02.380
<v Speaker 2>Be happy with who you are.</v>

1640
00:50:02.950 --> 00:50:04.000
<v Speaker 2>And why is my mom said,</v>

1641
00:50:04.001 --> 00:50:06.550
<v Speaker 2>you've got to know yourself before you can know anybody else.</v>

1642
00:50:07.850 --> 00:50:10.030
<v Speaker 2>She told me yourself trying to understand yourself.</v>

1643
00:50:11.020 --> 00:50:13.360
<v Speaker 2>Think what makes you happy and do that and what makes you sad.</v>

1644
00:50:13.361 --> 00:50:13.851
<v Speaker 2>Don't do it.</v>

1645
00:50:13.851 --> 00:50:14.531
<v Speaker 2>It's very simple.</v>

1646
00:50:14.531 --> 00:50:15.364
<v Speaker 2>Rarely.</v>

1647
00:50:15.430 --> 00:50:15.671
<v Speaker 2>If so,</v>

1648
00:50:15.671 --> 00:50:16.870
<v Speaker 2>it makes me sad now,</v>

1649
00:50:17.330 --> 00:50:18.550
<v Speaker 2>then I'm not going to do any more teeth.</v>

1650
00:50:18.551 --> 00:50:19.031
<v Speaker 2>I want my life.</v>

1651
00:50:19.031 --> 00:50:19.864
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to.</v>

1652
00:50:20.320 --> 00:50:22.840
<v Speaker 2>And if you know somebody can lead you down the wrong way and a wrong path in</v>

1653
00:50:22.841 --> 00:50:23.530
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>

1654
00:50:23.530 --> 00:50:24.363
<v Speaker 2>don't do it.</v>

1655
00:50:24.760 --> 00:50:25.480
<v Speaker 2>Simple,</v>

1656
00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:26.313
<v Speaker 2>very simple.</v>

1657
00:50:26.830 --> 00:50:27.380
<v Speaker 2>Say Self,</v>

1658
00:50:27.380 --> 00:50:28.460
<v Speaker 2>small time goals.</v>

1659
00:50:28.461 --> 00:50:31.340
<v Speaker 2>Longtime goals achieved them and move on.</v>

1660
00:50:31.790 --> 00:50:33.860
<v Speaker 2>Now how long did it take you for you lose the weight?</v>

1661
00:50:35.360 --> 00:50:38.930
<v Speaker 2>I started training in November,</v>

1662
00:50:38.930 --> 00:50:41.150
<v Speaker 2>2017 400 pounds.</v>

1663
00:50:41.210 --> 00:50:41.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1664
00:50:41.820 --> 00:50:42.653
<v Speaker 2>Ron.</v>

1665
00:50:43.010 --> 00:50:47.480
<v Speaker 2>I got down to 275 pounds in my first fight.</v>

1666
00:50:47.480 --> 00:50:49.550
<v Speaker 2>Buck in June</v>

1667
00:50:51.110 --> 00:50:53.240
<v Speaker 2>and by August and the second fight buck,</v>

1668
00:50:53.300 --> 00:50:55.490
<v Speaker 2>I was 258 pounds.</v>

1669
00:50:56.860 --> 00:51:01.640
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I've maintained that weight to 62 58 that's your ideal weight.</v>

1670
00:51:01.700 --> 00:51:01.971
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1671
00:51:01.971 --> 00:51:02.810
<v Speaker 2>From there to now.</v>

1672
00:51:04.070 --> 00:51:04.780
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1673
00:51:04.780 --> 00:51:05.150
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1674
00:51:05.150 --> 00:51:06.560
<v Speaker 2>what did you do differently with your diet?</v>

1675
00:51:06.590 --> 00:51:07.423
<v Speaker 2>Like what did you</v>

1676
00:51:09.080 --> 00:51:10.730
<v Speaker 2>I was eating a lot and drinking a lot.</v>

1677
00:51:12.020 --> 00:51:13.760
<v Speaker 2>I just stopped all that sort of stuff.</v>

1678
00:51:13.820 --> 00:51:17.090
<v Speaker 2>Like my weight wasn't bought on fro being a normal person.</v>

1679
00:51:17.091 --> 00:51:17.924
<v Speaker 2>He normally,</v>

1680
00:51:18.410 --> 00:51:21.500
<v Speaker 2>my weight was put on through excessive drinking of lager,</v>

1681
00:51:22.540 --> 00:51:27.290
<v Speaker 2>does like 500 calories in one pint of beer and I'd go out and drink a minimum of</v>

1682
00:51:27.291 --> 00:51:28.520
<v Speaker 2>18 of those beers,</v>

1683
00:51:30.440 --> 00:51:32.930
<v Speaker 2>follow by whiskey or vodka,</v>

1684
00:51:33.740 --> 00:51:34.640
<v Speaker 2>everything else.</v>

1685
00:51:34.820 --> 00:51:36.920
<v Speaker 2>Then I'd stop off on the way home and our pizzas,</v>

1686
00:51:36.921 --> 00:51:37.754
<v Speaker 2>Kabobs,</v>

1687
00:51:37.820 --> 00:51:38.810
<v Speaker 2>chocolates,</v>

1688
00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:41.300
<v Speaker 2>it was excessive living.</v>

1689
00:51:41.930 --> 00:51:43.460
<v Speaker 2>If he put your body through torture,</v>

1690
00:51:43.461 --> 00:51:44.750
<v Speaker 2>you can't expect to feel great.</v>

1691
00:51:45.050 --> 00:51:45.883
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1692
00:51:46.550 --> 00:51:48.320
<v Speaker 2>So what I did was society in Alfie,</v>

1693
00:51:48.380 --> 00:51:49.213
<v Speaker 2>not drinking</v>

1694
00:51:51.320 --> 00:51:52.153
<v Speaker 2>and that was it earlier.</v>

1695
00:51:52.160 --> 00:51:55.180
<v Speaker 2>I just trained on a daily basis for a long period of time and at,</v>

1696
00:51:55.190 --> 00:51:57.470
<v Speaker 2>at sensible and clean you off to court.</v>

1697
00:51:57.471 --> 00:52:01.700
<v Speaker 2>Every Vinno bought if you want faster results and then you do it.</v>

1698
00:52:01.820 --> 00:52:04.010
<v Speaker 2>Now you said you change your training as well.</v>

1699
00:52:04.820 --> 00:52:05.750
<v Speaker 2>What did you change up</v>

1700
00:52:07.520 --> 00:52:08.330
<v Speaker 2>before?</v>

1701
00:52:08.330 --> 00:52:09.880
<v Speaker 2>I was doing a lot of 'em</v>

1702
00:52:11.510 --> 00:52:16.510
<v Speaker 2>along marooning and along boxing works like 1215 rounds on the bug pad work,</v>

1703
00:52:17.931 --> 00:52:18.764
<v Speaker 2>all that sort of stuff.</v>

1704
00:52:19.090 --> 00:52:20.750
<v Speaker 2>Where in while I was trying to lose the weight,</v>

1705
00:52:20.780 --> 00:52:22.910
<v Speaker 2>I was doing more short explosive stuff.</v>

1706
00:52:23.570 --> 00:52:25.220
<v Speaker 2>Like I was doing short,</v>

1707
00:52:25.221 --> 00:52:27.740
<v Speaker 2>faster on such as fast as I could go basically.</v>

1708
00:52:28.190 --> 00:52:29.023
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1709
00:52:29.380 --> 00:52:31.610
<v Speaker 2>I would do more interval training and stuff like that.</v>

1710
00:52:32.330 --> 00:52:34.400
<v Speaker 2>Mainly it was a focusing on diet though.</v>

1711
00:52:34.460 --> 00:52:37.520
<v Speaker 2>Diet's the most important thing for any anybody trying to lose weight.</v>

1712
00:52:38.180 --> 00:52:41.390
<v Speaker 2>You could train like a Trojan warrior but not eight.</v>

1713
00:52:41.391 --> 00:52:41.751
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>

1714
00:52:41.751 --> 00:52:45.260
<v Speaker 2>And you go three steps forward and two and a half buck and you find yourself</v>

1715
00:52:45.261 --> 00:52:46.010
<v Speaker 2>after six months,</v>

1716
00:52:46.010 --> 00:52:47.330
<v Speaker 2>a little bit less than yours,</v>

1717
00:52:47.670 --> 00:52:51.410
<v Speaker 2>but he stay in the same position because with the Diet,</v>

1718
00:52:51.440 --> 00:52:52.760
<v Speaker 2>not that I'm a dietician,</v>

1719
00:52:52.761 --> 00:52:53.450
<v Speaker 2>but I know,</v>

1720
00:52:53.450 --> 00:52:56.930
<v Speaker 2>I know it works with losing weight heavy because he all the way through me</v>

1721
00:52:56.931 --> 00:52:58.130
<v Speaker 2>Korean upon a lot of weight,</v>

1722
00:52:58.880 --> 00:53:00.060
<v Speaker 2>I lost a hundred hundred,</v>

1723
00:53:00.290 --> 00:53:02.180
<v Speaker 2>just over a hundred pounds for the Klitschko fight.</v>

1724
00:53:02.180 --> 00:53:03.050
<v Speaker 2>The first time round</v>

1725
00:53:04.830 --> 00:53:09.080
<v Speaker 2>I lost over on Andre and 2527th impound before that.</v>

1726
00:53:09.081 --> 00:53:09.914
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

1727
00:53:10.130 --> 00:53:12.800
<v Speaker 2>so what I do to lose weight as they go on a no carb diet,</v>

1728
00:53:13.970 --> 00:53:17.660
<v Speaker 2>so it will be totally Keto ketosis diet.</v>

1729
00:53:17.730 --> 00:53:20.060
<v Speaker 2>I put my body into Quito shock and they say,</v>

1730
00:53:20.061 --> 00:53:20.631
<v Speaker 2>you should stay.</v>

1731
00:53:20.631 --> 00:53:21.920
<v Speaker 2>If you do need Kito Diet,</v>

1732
00:53:21.921 --> 00:53:23.330
<v Speaker 2>you should only do it for 11 days.</v>

1733
00:53:23.660 --> 00:53:25.070
<v Speaker 2>I do it for six to eight weeks.</v>

1734
00:53:25.080 --> 00:53:26.070
<v Speaker 2>Who said you should only do</v>

1735
00:53:26.070 --> 00:53:27.770
<v Speaker 1>it for 11 days are already somewhere.</v>

1736
00:53:27.910 --> 00:53:28.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1737
00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:29.100
<v Speaker 1>my nutritionist.</v>

1738
00:53:29.101 --> 00:53:29.341
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1739
00:53:29.341 --> 00:53:29.671
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

1740
00:53:29.671 --> 00:53:30.180
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1741
00:53:30.180 --> 00:53:30.481
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

1742
00:53:30.481 --> 00:53:32.370
<v Speaker 1>you can only do this diet for 11 days.</v>

1743
00:53:32.580 --> 00:53:33.450
<v Speaker 1>Has that have already been on it?</v>

1744
00:53:33.451 --> 00:53:34.284
<v Speaker 1>Six weeks.</v>

1745
00:53:34.440 --> 00:53:35.273
<v Speaker 1>Don't worry about it.</v>

1746
00:53:35.670 --> 00:53:36.570
<v Speaker 1>That's ridiculous.</v>

1747
00:53:36.750 --> 00:53:37.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1748
00:53:37.130 --> 00:53:37.500
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>

1749
00:53:37.500 --> 00:53:39.120
<v Speaker 1>I know guys who've done it for years now.</v>

1750
00:53:39.121 --> 00:53:39.750
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

1751
00:53:39.750 --> 00:53:40.940
<v Speaker 1>it's a healthy way of living.</v>

1752
00:53:40.970 --> 00:53:43.560
<v Speaker 1>It prevents diabetes and all these types of things as well.</v>

1753
00:53:43.590 --> 00:53:44.940
<v Speaker 1>There's definitely some benefits to it,</v>

1754
00:53:44.941 --> 00:53:49.110
<v Speaker 1>but there's concerns that for athletic performance that you should have higher</v>

1755
00:53:49.111 --> 00:53:50.040
<v Speaker 1>carbohydrates.</v>

1756
00:53:50.100 --> 00:53:50.610
<v Speaker 1>True,</v>

1757
00:53:50.610 --> 00:53:54.840
<v Speaker 1>but at this time I was just focusing on losing weight and the Keto Diet done</v>

1758
00:53:54.841 --> 00:53:55.674
<v Speaker 1>correct</v>

1759
00:53:56.610 --> 00:53:57.061
<v Speaker 2>is okay,</v>

1760
00:53:57.061 --> 00:53:58.200
<v Speaker 2>but I was doing it dirty.</v>

1761
00:53:58.410 --> 00:53:59.243
<v Speaker 2>How are we doing it?</v>

1762
00:53:59.430 --> 00:54:03.660
<v Speaker 2>How is Ivan for double parties with cheese and mayonnaise?</v>

1763
00:54:05.480 --> 00:54:07.800
<v Speaker 2>Is that bad full of fighting</v>

1764
00:54:07.880 --> 00:54:09.530
<v Speaker 1>grace and it can't be good for your arteries?</v>

1765
00:54:09.531 --> 00:54:10.580
<v Speaker 1>Kind of wow,</v>

1766
00:54:10.640 --> 00:54:11.473
<v Speaker 1>this is a loan.</v>

1767
00:54:12.410 --> 00:54:13.820
<v Speaker 1>I was often tunnels of meat,</v>

1768
00:54:13.880 --> 00:54:14.510
<v Speaker 1>fried,</v>

1769
00:54:14.510 --> 00:54:17.000
<v Speaker 1>fried with cheese,</v>

1770
00:54:17.001 --> 00:54:17.834
<v Speaker 1>mayonnaise,</v>

1771
00:54:17.840 --> 00:54:18.351
<v Speaker 1>bacon,</v>

1772
00:54:18.351 --> 00:54:18.651
<v Speaker 1>eggs,</v>

1773
00:54:18.651 --> 00:54:19.484
<v Speaker 1>sausage,</v>

1774
00:54:19.580 --> 00:54:20.001
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

1775
00:54:20.001 --> 00:54:20.510
<v Speaker 1>Sounds good.</v>

1776
00:54:20.510 --> 00:54:21.291
<v Speaker 1>My ideal diet,</v>

1777
00:54:21.291 --> 00:54:22.500
<v Speaker 1>basically I was thinking,</v>

1778
00:54:22.501 --> 00:54:23.360
<v Speaker 1>this can't be a die.</v>

1779
00:54:23.410 --> 00:54:24.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to lose weight.</v>

1780
00:54:24.411 --> 00:54:25.620
<v Speaker 1>I miss and you lost weight.</v>

1781
00:54:25.820 --> 00:54:26.421
<v Speaker 1>I lost the weight.</v>

1782
00:54:26.421 --> 00:54:27.254
<v Speaker 1>I lost it all.</v>

1783
00:54:27.500 --> 00:54:27.741
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1784
00:54:27.741 --> 00:54:30.410
<v Speaker 1>You'd be stunned at what is actually healthy and what's not.</v>

1785
00:54:30.870 --> 00:54:31.703
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1786
00:54:31.770 --> 00:54:34.200
<v Speaker 2>I suppose you can't go wrong if he cooking meat,</v>

1787
00:54:35.460 --> 00:54:38.670
<v Speaker 2>Walton to meet whatever they put in in the beat for whatever it is you're</v>

1788
00:54:38.671 --> 00:54:39.504
<v Speaker 2>eating.</v>

1789
00:54:40.110 --> 00:54:43.320
<v Speaker 2>Processed foods are the ones that got all the additives and all that stuff.</v>

1790
00:54:43.730 --> 00:54:46.340
<v Speaker 1>Processed foods and sugar and bread and carbohydrates,</v>

1791
00:54:46.460 --> 00:54:48.620
<v Speaker 1>especially refined carbohydrates.</v>

1792
00:54:49.520 --> 00:54:51.290
<v Speaker 2>My life is,</v>

1793
00:54:51.860 --> 00:54:55.280
<v Speaker 2>I don't avoid Futz Futz my friend.</v>

1794
00:54:55.281 --> 00:54:56.114
<v Speaker 2>Basically,</v>

1795
00:54:56.630 --> 00:54:57.560
<v Speaker 2>if I look at food,</v>

1796
00:54:57.561 --> 00:54:58.221
<v Speaker 2>someone's on a diet,</v>

1797
00:54:58.221 --> 00:54:59.630
<v Speaker 2>they look at the fat content in something.</v>

1798
00:54:59.631 --> 00:55:00.680
<v Speaker 2>I don't look into sugar,</v>

1799
00:55:01.030 --> 00:55:01.580
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

1800
00:55:01.580 --> 00:55:03.230
<v Speaker 2>because the thought I can burn fat off,</v>

1801
00:55:03.231 --> 00:55:06.890
<v Speaker 2>but sugar will go into it stores in the body and it stays in longer.</v>

1802
00:55:06.891 --> 00:55:08.180
<v Speaker 2>Nit eventually turns to fat.</v>

1803
00:55:08.610 --> 00:55:12.900
<v Speaker 1>Did you change anything in terms of your strength and conditioning work or your</v>

1804
00:55:12.901 --> 00:55:13.920
<v Speaker 1>boxing work?</v>

1805
00:55:13.921 --> 00:55:14.520
<v Speaker 1>Like did you,</v>

1806
00:55:14.520 --> 00:55:16.590
<v Speaker 1>did you hire a new boxing trainer?</v>

1807
00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:17.460
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1808
00:55:17.460 --> 00:55:19.530
<v Speaker 2>I've not got the same trainer as I did up be fall.</v>

1809
00:55:20.130 --> 00:55:20.591
<v Speaker 2>And why did,</v>

1810
00:55:20.591 --> 00:55:21.630
<v Speaker 2>why did you switch things up?</v>

1811
00:55:22.230 --> 00:55:23.760
<v Speaker 2>Because it was stale in the gym.</v>

1812
00:55:24.330 --> 00:55:25.830
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have no motivation,</v>

1813
00:55:25.831 --> 00:55:26.670
<v Speaker 2>no more pain.</v>

1814
00:55:26.690 --> 00:55:28.170
<v Speaker 2>I have done the same thing for years</v>

1815
00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:31.940
<v Speaker 2>and I didn't have any more motivation in the gym.</v>

1816
00:55:31.941 --> 00:55:35.940
<v Speaker 2>I that have a new new team and I knew this going into this,</v>

1817
00:55:35.941 --> 00:55:36.740
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1818
00:55:36.740 --> 00:55:39.000
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] come back till I wanted a new team.</v>

1819
00:55:39.001 --> 00:55:39.960
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to start fresh.</v>

1820
00:55:39.961 --> 00:55:41.130
<v Speaker 2>Give me self some goals.</v>

1821
00:55:41.270 --> 00:55:41.870
<v Speaker 2>Give me self.</v>

1822
00:55:41.870 --> 00:55:42.691
<v Speaker 2>So a new team,</v>

1823
00:55:42.691 --> 00:55:45.420
<v Speaker 2>more positivity is that of doing the same stuff day in,</v>

1824
00:55:45.421 --> 00:55:46.254
<v Speaker 2>day out,</v>

1825
00:55:46.500 --> 00:55:47.311
<v Speaker 2>switch off the train.</v>

1826
00:55:47.311 --> 00:55:49.740
<v Speaker 2>I did choice or trainer was very,</v>

1827
00:55:49.741 --> 00:55:51.180
<v Speaker 2>very controversial as well.</v>

1828
00:55:51.340 --> 00:55:53.640
<v Speaker 2>Who did you go when I went with an unknown trainer.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I never had any intentions of training.</v>

1850
00:56:33.520 --> 00:56:35.650
<v Speaker 2>I went to over there for a good drink up and a party.</v>

1851
00:56:37.390 --> 00:56:39.630
<v Speaker 2>So gets out that um,</v>

1852
00:56:39.640 --> 00:56:40.990
<v Speaker 2>we're all in the coffee shop on the,</v>

1853
00:56:40.991 --> 00:56:44.680
<v Speaker 2>on the part of the noose and these two stoners,</v>

1854
00:56:44.681 --> 00:56:46.240
<v Speaker 2>we're walking past in Bikini's,</v>

1855
00:56:46.690 --> 00:56:48.370
<v Speaker 2>I mean 10 out or 10 each.</v>

1856
00:56:49.270 --> 00:56:50.590
<v Speaker 2>And I said to Ben Davison,</v>

1857
00:56:51.520 --> 00:56:51.791
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

1858
00:56:51.791 --> 00:56:52.930
<v Speaker 2>if you go and get me their numbers,</v>

1859
00:56:52.931 --> 00:56:53.764
<v Speaker 2>Ben,</v>

1860
00:56:53.920 --> 00:56:54.161
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

1861
00:56:54.161 --> 00:56:55.360
<v Speaker 2>you can be my boxing trainer.</v>

1862
00:56:55.361 --> 00:56:55.631
<v Speaker 2>He went,</v>

1863
00:56:55.631 --> 00:56:56.440
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

1864
00:56:56.440 --> 00:56:56.681
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

1865
00:56:56.681 --> 00:56:58.180
<v Speaker 2>you heard me correct the first time.</v>

1866
00:56:58.780 --> 00:56:59.613
<v Speaker 2>So off he went.</v>

1867
00:57:00.310 --> 00:57:01.180
<v Speaker 2>After these two,</v>

1868
00:57:01.330 --> 00:57:02.680
<v Speaker 2>two good looking girls,</v>

1869
00:57:04.030 --> 00:57:05.080
<v Speaker 2>20 minutes goes by,</v>

1870
00:57:05.081 --> 00:57:05.914
<v Speaker 2>he comes back,</v>

1871
00:57:06.850 --> 00:57:07.683
<v Speaker 2>no number.</v>

1872
00:57:09.520 --> 00:57:09.791
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

1873
00:57:09.791 --> 00:57:10.240
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1874
00:57:10.240 --> 00:57:10.511
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

1875
00:57:10.511 --> 00:57:11.650
<v Speaker 2>clearly you're not the mom for me.</v>

1876
00:57:11.651 --> 00:57:11.921
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

1877
00:57:11.921 --> 00:57:14.470
<v Speaker 2>because the trainer I need I top minerals.</v>

1878
00:57:16.890 --> 00:57:17.141
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

1879
00:57:17.141 --> 00:57:18.700
<v Speaker 2>and if he can't get a woman's number,</v>

1880
00:57:19.240 --> 00:57:19.481
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

1881
00:57:19.481 --> 00:57:19.631
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1882
00:57:19.631 --> 00:57:20.950
<v Speaker 2>you're not clearly can't win fights.</v>

1883
00:57:20.970 --> 00:57:21.340
<v Speaker 2>Kenya.</v>

1884
00:57:21.340 --> 00:57:22.173
<v Speaker 2>Simple.</v>

1885
00:57:22.460 --> 00:57:22.900
<v Speaker 2>Hey Ma.</v>

1886
00:57:22.900 --> 00:57:23.240
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1887
00:57:23.240 --> 00:57:26.500
<v Speaker 2>I'll show ya off all in the mood to misstate.</v>

1888
00:57:26.501 --> 00:57:29.980
<v Speaker 2>It comes by that as a number bang straight over.</v>

1889
00:57:30.250 --> 00:57:31.750
<v Speaker 2>I said excellent motivation.</v>

1890
00:57:31.810 --> 00:57:32.643
<v Speaker 2>You hired,</v>

1891
00:57:33.280 --> 00:57:35.950
<v Speaker 2>you hired him because he got hot girls phone numbers.</v>

1892
00:57:35.980 --> 00:57:36.700
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

1893
00:57:36.700 --> 00:57:37.533
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

1894
00:57:37.600 --> 00:57:38.800
<v Speaker 2>I hired him for that reason.</v>

1895
00:57:38.801 --> 00:57:40.870
<v Speaker 2>Not just the hot girls phone numbers.</v>

1896
00:57:41.020 --> 00:57:42.010
<v Speaker 2>That wasn't the case.</v>

1897
00:57:42.340 --> 00:57:45.880
<v Speaker 2>It was the case that he was willing to put himself on the line to prove to me</v>

1898
00:57:45.881 --> 00:57:48.250
<v Speaker 2>that he could do something that takes minerals.</v>

1899
00:57:48.730 --> 00:57:52.000
<v Speaker 2>And if you don't have any confidence then you can't go over to somebody who's</v>

1900
00:57:52.001 --> 00:57:52.870
<v Speaker 2>really good looking and say,</v>

1901
00:57:52.871 --> 00:57:53.071
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1902
00:57:53.071 --> 00:57:54.040
<v Speaker 2>on my name's Ben.</v>

1903
00:57:54.310 --> 00:57:55.960
<v Speaker 2>And that might make once your number,</v>

1904
00:57:55.961 --> 00:57:56.741
<v Speaker 2>is that possible?</v>

1905
00:57:56.741 --> 00:58:00.310
<v Speaker 2>Like he wouldn't have got the number and if he didn't have any confidence and he</v>

1906
00:58:00.311 --> 00:58:01.630
<v Speaker 2>didn't have any gumption to him,</v>

1907
00:58:01.631 --> 00:58:02.464
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't have got our number.</v>

1908
00:58:03.010 --> 00:58:05.890
<v Speaker 2>So I knew he was a good choice because he was young and fresh and hit a point to</v>

1909
00:58:05.891 --> 00:58:09.520
<v Speaker 2>prove and he wanted to do something with his life and I give him that</v>

1910
00:58:09.521 --> 00:58:12.610
<v Speaker 2>opportunity and it was the best decision I ever made.</v>

1911
00:58:13.120 --> 00:58:15.580
<v Speaker 2>Now what about what he knows about boxing?</v>

1912
00:58:15.610 --> 00:58:16.900
<v Speaker 2>Obviously that played a factor.</v>

1913
00:58:16.910 --> 00:58:20.860
<v Speaker 2>If he's just some random smell who is good at getting girls numbers?</v>

1914
00:58:20.920 --> 00:58:21.161
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1915
00:58:21.161 --> 00:58:23.120
<v Speaker 2>it wouldn't be the train if it was just that way.</v>

1916
00:58:23.390 --> 00:58:24.340
<v Speaker 2>The for this,</v>

1917
00:58:24.400 --> 00:58:28.870
<v Speaker 2>he was taking me on the Parkinson's stuff in between Billy Joe sessions and we</v>

1918
00:58:28.871 --> 00:58:29.920
<v Speaker 2>jelled straight away.</v>

1919
00:58:29.980 --> 00:58:31.240
<v Speaker 2>Me And Ben think alike.</v>

1920
00:58:32.140 --> 00:58:35.830
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes you meet people in your life and you're very similar in personalities</v>

1921
00:58:35.831 --> 00:58:37.360
<v Speaker 2>and we're like the same things.</v>

1922
00:58:37.360 --> 00:58:38.270
<v Speaker 2>We like to do the same thing.</v>

1923
00:58:38.271 --> 00:58:40.450
<v Speaker 2>It's got the same type of personality.</v>

1924
00:58:41.230 --> 00:58:43.090
<v Speaker 2>We've just jelled automatically.</v>

1925
00:58:43.270 --> 00:58:46.180
<v Speaker 2>Our Gel leaving before I said this about the number of the girls,</v>

1926
00:58:46.750 --> 00:58:48.970
<v Speaker 2>I already knew that I was going to make Ben Mie trainer.</v>

1927
00:58:49.750 --> 00:58:54.230
<v Speaker 2>It got a very keen eye for boxing and what he does is,</v>

1928
00:58:54.280 --> 00:58:55.113
<v Speaker 2>is very,</v>

1929
00:58:56.080 --> 00:58:58.690
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't look like he knows a lot about boxing by looking at,</v>

1930
00:58:58.691 --> 00:59:00.790
<v Speaker 2>it just looks like a young blood could look in fella,</v>

1931
00:59:01.630 --> 00:59:05.710
<v Speaker 2>but when you sit down and analyze the fighters,</v>

1932
00:59:06.220 --> 00:59:08.080
<v Speaker 2>a studies boxing day and night,</v>

1933
00:59:09.130 --> 00:59:11.680
<v Speaker 2>we'll be out watching movies after the train bends in his room,</v>

1934
00:59:11.681 --> 00:59:13.180
<v Speaker 2>watching Deontay wilder,</v>

1935
00:59:13.181 --> 00:59:13.931
<v Speaker 2>watching the fights,</v>

1936
00:59:13.931 --> 00:59:14.764
<v Speaker 2>watching this and watching.</v>

1937
00:59:15.280 --> 00:59:18.580
<v Speaker 2>He studies the game and he's always coming up with different game plans and how</v>

1938
00:59:18.581 --> 00:59:20.260
<v Speaker 2>to beat this personnel to beat that person.</v>

1939
00:59:20.930 --> 00:59:21.201
<v Speaker 2>Very,</v>

1940
00:59:21.201 --> 00:59:21.800
<v Speaker 2>very up here.</v>

1941
00:59:21.800 --> 00:59:22.581
<v Speaker 2>He's very knowledgeable.</v>

1942
00:59:22.581 --> 00:59:24.830
<v Speaker 2>Your mother and I said before even made him my coach.</v>

1943
00:59:25.610 --> 00:59:30.230
<v Speaker 2>I said within five years you're going to be one of the lead in boxing trainers</v>

1944
00:59:30.231 --> 00:59:31.064
<v Speaker 2>in the world</v>

1945
00:59:32.330 --> 00:59:35.390
<v Speaker 2>and now he's got his chance and if I beat Deontay Wilder,</v>

1946
00:59:36.050 --> 00:59:40.790
<v Speaker 2>Ben Davis and a win ring magazine trainer of the year 2018</v>

1947
00:59:41.420 --> 00:59:41.661
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

1948
00:59:41.661 --> 00:59:44.660
<v Speaker 1>how much different is your training with him then with your last year?</v>

1949
00:59:46.100 --> 00:59:48.870
<v Speaker 2>It's different pay towards the top trainer.</v>

1950
00:59:49.110 --> 00:59:50.760
<v Speaker 2>He got me to be world heavyweight champion,</v>

1951
00:59:52.400 --> 00:59:53.250
<v Speaker 2>but like I said,</v>

1952
00:59:53.310 --> 00:59:55.260
<v Speaker 2>we never had no more motivation in the gym.</v>

1953
00:59:55.261 --> 00:59:56.094
<v Speaker 2>It was stale.</v>

1954
00:59:56.910 --> 00:59:57.630
<v Speaker 2>There was no,</v>

1955
00:59:57.630 --> 00:59:58.920
<v Speaker 2>there was no vibe in the gym.</v>

1956
00:59:58.921 --> 01:00:00.540
<v Speaker 2>It was just like work again,</v>

1957
01:00:00.710 --> 01:00:01.543
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to be there.</v>

1958
01:00:02.030 --> 01:00:04.650
<v Speaker 2>How to tie and training camp a few times I've walked out at the gym every time</v>

1959
01:00:04.651 --> 01:00:06.270
<v Speaker 2>because I didn't want to be in the gym.</v>

1960
01:00:06.300 --> 01:00:07.830
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have no motivation to be there.</v>

1961
01:00:08.790 --> 01:00:09.690
<v Speaker 2>So the most,</v>

1962
01:00:09.750 --> 01:00:12.450
<v Speaker 2>the main thing is boxing is boxing name rocket science.</v>

1963
01:00:12.451 --> 01:00:13.650
<v Speaker 2>You can only do a few things.</v>

1964
01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:16.740
<v Speaker 2>I think the most important things in boxing is road work,</v>

1965
01:00:16.770 --> 01:00:17.341
<v Speaker 2>pad work,</v>

1966
01:00:17.341 --> 01:00:19.260
<v Speaker 2>inspiring everything else,</v>

1967
01:00:20.010 --> 01:00:20.843
<v Speaker 2>not interested.</v>

1968
01:00:21.330 --> 01:00:26.330
<v Speaker 2>My favorite thing to do is spa and I think what better to do than practice what</v>

1969
01:00:26.581 --> 01:00:29.400
<v Speaker 2>you do with another person fighting other men and that's me.</v>

1970
01:00:29.490 --> 01:00:29.801
<v Speaker 2>That's me,</v>

1971
01:00:29.801 --> 01:00:33.090
<v Speaker 2>a her finger and I've often inspired hundreds arounds for fights to get fit and</v>

1972
01:00:33.091 --> 01:00:33.924
<v Speaker 2>lose weight.</v>

1973
01:00:34.170 --> 01:00:35.560
<v Speaker 2>James Tony used to do that too.</v>

1974
01:00:35.561 --> 01:00:40.080
<v Speaker 2>He used to power hundreds AANDRA's rounds to get self fit and that's what I've</v>

1975
01:00:40.081 --> 01:00:40.914
<v Speaker 2>done it as well.</v>

1976
01:00:41.790 --> 01:00:42.780
<v Speaker 2>It gives me a favorite thing,</v>

1977
01:00:43.020 --> 01:00:44.700
<v Speaker 2>but now we do a lot of strong conditioning work.</v>

1978
01:00:44.701 --> 01:00:46.050
<v Speaker 2>We do a lot of weights and stuff.</v>

1979
01:00:46.710 --> 01:00:50.490
<v Speaker 2>I figured out over here being around like American fighters and stuff,</v>

1980
01:00:50.491 --> 01:00:51.510
<v Speaker 2>especially in the boxes,</v>

1981
01:00:52.050 --> 01:00:57.050
<v Speaker 2>they don't have that like that that can that term program of weights and stuff.</v>

1982
01:00:57.901 --> 01:01:00.210
<v Speaker 2>It's more like maybe lightweights,</v>

1983
01:01:00.211 --> 01:01:02.610
<v Speaker 2>loader repetitions as it's often I'm being heavyweight.</v>

1984
01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:04.050
<v Speaker 2>I lift heavy weight,</v>

1985
01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:06.120
<v Speaker 2>very heavy weights and dead lifting,</v>

1986
01:01:06.121 --> 01:01:09.510
<v Speaker 2>very heavy weights and bench and heavy weights and using my body weight and in a</v>

1987
01:01:09.511 --> 01:01:10.344
<v Speaker 2>lot of stuff.</v>

1988
01:01:10.410 --> 01:01:11.400
<v Speaker 2>So I believe it's very,</v>

1989
01:01:11.401 --> 01:01:13.950
<v Speaker 2>very key factor in being a big strong man.</v>

1990
01:01:15.070 --> 01:01:17.410
<v Speaker 1>So he's responsible for that as well.</v>

1991
01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:18.251
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1992
01:01:18.251 --> 01:01:19.260
<v Speaker 1>I have another guy who does that.</v>

1993
01:01:19.330 --> 01:01:20.710
<v Speaker 1>You have another guy that's strength conditioning one.</v>

1994
01:01:20.711 --> 01:01:21.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1995
01:01:21.100 --> 01:01:26.100
<v Speaker 1>One of the things about a boxing trainer is knowing when to pull you back,</v>

1996
01:01:26.260 --> 01:01:27.670
<v Speaker 1>knowing when you're peaking.</v>

1997
01:01:28.060 --> 01:01:32.860
<v Speaker 1>And that mostly comes from long term success.</v>

1998
01:01:33.100 --> 01:01:33.911
<v Speaker 1>Working with many,</v>

1999
01:01:33.911 --> 01:01:34.744
<v Speaker 1>many fighters.</v>

2000
01:01:34.930 --> 01:01:38.200
<v Speaker 1>That's gotta be one of the biggest chances you take with a young guy.</v>

2001
01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:39.231
<v Speaker 2>It is pulled.</v>

2002
01:01:39.231 --> 01:01:40.340
<v Speaker 2>I put him to the test many,</v>

2003
01:01:40.341 --> 01:01:43.130
<v Speaker 2>many times and he does.</v>

2004
01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:46.820
<v Speaker 2>He can say it sometimes being a successful trainer,</v>

2005
01:01:48.500 --> 01:01:51.320
<v Speaker 2>doing successful things and make it champions and then you go work.</v>

2006
01:01:51.321 --> 01:01:51.731
<v Speaker 2>We're not trained.</v>

2007
01:01:51.731 --> 01:01:53.060
<v Speaker 2>You think you don't know nothing.</v>

2008
01:01:54.500 --> 01:01:54.711
<v Speaker 2>Tough.</v>

2009
01:01:54.711 --> 01:01:54.981
<v Speaker 2>Smart.</v>

2010
01:01:54.981 --> 01:01:56.150
<v Speaker 2>I've worked a few trainers and fault.</v>

2011
01:01:56.151 --> 01:01:58.220
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to go into any names cause that'd be disrespectful,</v>

2012
01:01:58.850 --> 01:02:02.000
<v Speaker 2>but that knows when I'm feeling good.</v>

2013
01:02:02.180 --> 01:02:04.010
<v Speaker 2>My style is all about feelgood factor.</v>

2014
01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:05.471
<v Speaker 2>And if I failed,</v>

2015
01:02:05.471 --> 01:02:05.780
<v Speaker 2>good,</v>

2016
01:02:05.780 --> 01:02:06.291
<v Speaker 2>I'll fight.</v>

2017
01:02:06.291 --> 01:02:07.124
<v Speaker 2>Excellent.</v>

2018
01:02:07.700 --> 01:02:09.570
<v Speaker 2>And if I'm not failing on onto the web,</v>

2019
01:02:09.590 --> 01:02:10.160
<v Speaker 2>then I'll fail.</v>

2020
01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:10.431
<v Speaker 2>I'll,</v>

2021
01:02:10.431 --> 01:02:11.330
<v Speaker 2>I'll fight rubbish.</v>

2022
01:02:11.690 --> 01:02:12.860
<v Speaker 1>Do you know when,</v>

2023
01:02:12.861 --> 01:02:15.330
<v Speaker 1>like when you show up at the gym and you're feeling like shit,</v>

2024
01:02:15.331 --> 01:02:16.670
<v Speaker 1>do you know when to back out of there?</v>

2025
01:02:18.160 --> 01:02:18.993
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2026
01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:23.010
<v Speaker 2>often have went to the gym not wanting to be in the gym and felt like shit,</v>

2027
01:02:23.011 --> 01:02:26.460
<v Speaker 2>but they're not the best training session in middle life does happen many,</v>

2028
01:02:26.461 --> 01:02:29.850
<v Speaker 2>many times until you actually work it out and get into the,</v>

2029
01:02:29.910 --> 01:02:30.690
<v Speaker 2>into the groove.</v>

2030
01:02:30.690 --> 01:02:33.060
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you can really know what you're going to feel like until you start</v>

2031
01:02:33.061 --> 01:02:35.460
<v Speaker 2>training because if he went on how he felt the falls,</v>

2032
01:02:35.461 --> 01:02:38.160
<v Speaker 2>the gym sometimes then you won't be in the gym at all.</v>

2033
01:02:39.180 --> 01:02:42.900
<v Speaker 2>But I do believe what you said is very correct and it's the most important thing</v>

2034
01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:45.270
<v Speaker 2>that anybody's ever talked about to me.</v>

2035
01:02:45.750 --> 01:02:48.480
<v Speaker 2>And I'm glad that you brought it up because not a lot of people have that</v>

2036
01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:51.540
<v Speaker 2>ability to know when to pull your five to buck.</v>

2037
01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:52.620
<v Speaker 2>And NOFX is enough.</v>

2038
01:02:53.130 --> 01:02:56.790
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people think because it's a bigger fight than your last one.</v>

2039
01:02:56.790 --> 01:02:59.640
<v Speaker 2>You've got to try and double his art training harder than you've ever trained</v>

2040
01:02:59.641 --> 01:03:00.180
<v Speaker 2>before.</v>

2041
01:03:00.180 --> 01:03:01.013
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2042
01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:02.160
<v Speaker 2>He run in forever.</v>

2043
01:03:02.161 --> 01:03:02.994
<v Speaker 2>You left him heavier?</v>

2044
01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:03.833
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2045
01:03:03.930 --> 01:03:05.140
<v Speaker 2>because I already trained hard,</v>

2046
01:03:05.141 --> 01:03:08.700
<v Speaker 2>so I don't need to train it now to where some people think,</v>

2047
01:03:08.701 --> 01:03:08.881
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

2048
01:03:08.881 --> 01:03:09.780
<v Speaker 2>this is wild to fight.</v>

2049
01:03:09.781 --> 01:03:10.920
<v Speaker 2>We need to be fitter than ever.</v>

2050
01:03:10.921 --> 01:03:14.160
<v Speaker 2>We need to run up a mountain carrying a backpack on my back and pull three</v>

2051
01:03:14.161 --> 01:03:15.720
<v Speaker 2>bullet there and wrestle two bears,</v>

2052
01:03:16.050 --> 01:03:20.970
<v Speaker 2>but it's not the case on Ben knows that's not the case is very cautious.</v>

2053
01:03:20.971 --> 01:03:22.170
<v Speaker 2>I've mentioned it to him many,</v>

2054
01:03:22.171 --> 01:03:23.520
<v Speaker 2>many times about overtraining,</v>

2055
01:03:23.521 --> 01:03:24.091
<v Speaker 2>overtraining,</v>

2056
01:03:24.091 --> 01:03:24.924
<v Speaker 2>overtraining.</v>

2057
01:03:25.110 --> 01:03:27.570
<v Speaker 2>How many times do you see fighters leave all in the gym?</v>

2058
01:03:28.290 --> 01:03:29.123
<v Speaker 2>Quite a bit.</v>

2059
01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:30.420
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to leave this in the gym.</v>

2060
01:03:30.421 --> 01:03:31.770
<v Speaker 2>I want to leave it in the ring on the night.</v>

2061
01:03:32.370 --> 01:03:35.700
<v Speaker 2>I'd rather be a little bit on fit,</v>

2062
01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:39.930
<v Speaker 2>a lot on fit rather than it as an a tiny bit.</v>

2063
01:03:39.930 --> 01:03:43.710
<v Speaker 2>Overtrained I've been overtrained and it's like being on the water.</v>

2064
01:03:44.220 --> 01:03:45.090
<v Speaker 2>You've got to go snap.</v>

2065
01:03:45.120 --> 01:03:46.290
<v Speaker 2>You can't put things together.</v>

2066
01:03:46.291 --> 01:03:46.831
<v Speaker 2>You want to,</v>

2067
01:03:46.831 --> 01:03:47.100
<v Speaker 2>you can,</v>

2068
01:03:47.100 --> 01:03:47.761
<v Speaker 2>you can see it coming,</v>

2069
01:03:47.761 --> 01:03:48.810
<v Speaker 2>but you can't do nothing about it.</v>

2070
01:03:48.811 --> 01:03:49.870
<v Speaker 2>It's worse than unfit.</v>

2071
01:03:49.990 --> 01:03:50.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2072
01:03:50.420 --> 01:03:51.120
<v Speaker 2>because you're,</v>

2073
01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:52.260
<v Speaker 2>you're compromised.</v>

2074
01:03:52.620 --> 01:03:56.760
<v Speaker 2>I've been overtrained before and I've been totally unfit fat as anything.</v>

2075
01:03:57.340 --> 01:03:59.040
<v Speaker 2>I'd rather be unfair 10 times a day.</v>

2076
01:03:59.041 --> 01:04:02.940
<v Speaker 2>Then overtrained once cannot do nothing when you're overtrained but at least</v>

2077
01:04:03.300 --> 01:04:03.931
<v Speaker 2>when you were on fit,</v>

2078
01:04:03.931 --> 01:04:04.830
<v Speaker 2>you lose your breath.</v>

2079
01:04:05.220 --> 01:04:08.130
<v Speaker 2>But you read your cover when you arrest and you get back at it again.</v>

2080
01:04:08.700 --> 01:04:10.310
<v Speaker 2>But overtrain you just one page,</v>

2081
01:04:10.311 --> 01:04:11.100
<v Speaker 2>you can't do nothing.</v>

2082
01:04:11.100 --> 01:04:12.060
<v Speaker 2>You never get out of the month.</v>

2083
01:04:12.260 --> 01:04:12.870
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2084
01:04:12.870 --> 01:04:15.180
<v Speaker 2>Now you have a strength and conditioning coach.</v>

2085
01:04:15.181 --> 01:04:16.260
<v Speaker 2>And how often do you do that?</v>

2086
01:04:16.860 --> 01:04:19.110
<v Speaker 2>We do that five days a week.</v>

2087
01:04:19.350 --> 01:04:19.740
<v Speaker 2>You do?</v>

2088
01:04:19.740 --> 01:04:20.250
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2089
01:04:20.250 --> 01:04:21.083
<v Speaker 2>That's quite a bit.</v>

2090
01:04:21.450 --> 01:04:22.283
<v Speaker 2>Are you running?</v>

2091
01:04:22.450 --> 01:04:22.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2092
01:04:22.760 --> 01:04:23.540
<v Speaker 2>we were on,</v>

2093
01:04:23.540 --> 01:04:25.110
<v Speaker 2>we run on three times a week.</v>

2094
01:04:25.500 --> 01:04:26.970
<v Speaker 2>So you're running three times a week.</v>

2095
01:04:26.971 --> 01:04:28.680
<v Speaker 2>Strength and conditioning five times a week.</v>

2096
01:04:28.681 --> 01:04:29.520
<v Speaker 2>And on top of that,</v>

2097
01:04:29.521 --> 01:04:30.300
<v Speaker 2>all your boxing work?</v>

2098
01:04:30.300 --> 01:04:30.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2099
01:04:30.620 --> 01:04:31.950
<v Speaker 2>we box six days a week.</v>

2100
01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:33.833
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2101
01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:35.273
<v Speaker 2>That's a lot of work.</v>

2102
01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:36.313
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

2103
01:04:36.510 --> 01:04:37.141
<v Speaker 2>Now you're,</v>

2104
01:04:37.141 --> 01:04:39.450
<v Speaker 2>you're doing dead lifts and bench press.</v>

2105
01:04:39.451 --> 01:04:40.080
<v Speaker 2>And I mean,</v>

2106
01:04:40.080 --> 01:04:42.450
<v Speaker 2>how is this a guy that's worked with other boxers before?</v>

2107
01:04:42.451 --> 01:04:46.350
<v Speaker 2>I've worked with this guy for three years.</v>

2108
01:04:47.880 --> 01:04:48.713
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2109
01:04:49.350 --> 01:04:50.730
<v Speaker 2>when I first started working with him,</v>

2110
01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:55.340
<v Speaker 2>he worked with boxers before yet a lot of local boxes and I'm British boxers,</v>

2111
01:04:56.010 --> 01:04:58.890
<v Speaker 2>but he never worked with a heavyweight weight before and he didn't know what he</v>

2112
01:04:58.891 --> 01:05:02.790
<v Speaker 2>was doing because everyone makes the same mistake.</v>

2113
01:05:02.791 --> 01:05:04.850
<v Speaker 2>They're only humans will train a heavyweight labeled train,</v>

2114
01:05:04.860 --> 01:05:05.693
<v Speaker 2>the lightweight,</v>

2115
01:05:06.030 --> 01:05:08.280
<v Speaker 2>they're not boxing trainers try for conditioning trainers.</v>

2116
01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:11.220
<v Speaker 2>So he was trying to make it in the beginning and he was trying to make me do</v>

2117
01:05:11.221 --> 01:05:12.520
<v Speaker 2>something that attendance stone,</v>

2118
01:05:12.580 --> 01:05:15.000
<v Speaker 2>145 pound guy was doing,</v>

2119
01:05:15.210 --> 01:05:15.960
<v Speaker 2>it's not possible.</v>

2120
01:05:15.960 --> 01:05:16.950
<v Speaker 2>It's a different world,</v>

2121
01:05:17.500 --> 01:05:20.360
<v Speaker 2>but only through experience did he realize what,</v>

2122
01:05:20.410 --> 01:05:20.570
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

2123
01:05:20.570 --> 01:05:22.210
<v Speaker 2>what we need to do and what we don't need to do.</v>

2124
01:05:22.300 --> 01:05:23.133
<v Speaker 2>And now he's like,</v>

2125
01:05:23.260 --> 01:05:24.011
<v Speaker 2>it's perfect.</v>

2126
01:05:24.011 --> 01:05:26.830
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't change him for the world and I don't know what I'd do if I didn't</v>

2127
01:05:26.831 --> 01:05:28.630
<v Speaker 2>have him because I'd have to go,</v>

2128
01:05:28.660 --> 01:05:29.230
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2129
01:05:29.230 --> 01:05:29.931
<v Speaker 2>go from wall.</v>

2130
01:05:29.931 --> 01:05:31.480
<v Speaker 2>That same learning process again,</v>

2131
01:05:33.160 --> 01:05:36.370
<v Speaker 2>and it's not just heavyweights is heavyweight boxing because I had,</v>

2132
01:05:36.371 --> 01:05:40.270
<v Speaker 2>this guy is Mr Olympia guy and he used to train some massive guys,</v>

2133
01:05:40.271 --> 01:05:41.500
<v Speaker 2>350 pounds,</v>

2134
01:05:41.501 --> 01:05:42.334
<v Speaker 2>solid muscle,</v>

2135
01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:44.620
<v Speaker 2>but he didn't know anything about boxing.</v>

2136
01:05:45.030 --> 01:05:47.110
<v Speaker 2>And you box in his performance sport.</v>

2137
01:05:47.480 --> 01:05:50.630
<v Speaker 2>And no matter if you look like an Adonis but you,</v>

2138
01:05:50.631 --> 01:05:52.600
<v Speaker 2>you can't do five rounds is pointless.</v>

2139
01:05:53.380 --> 01:05:55.840
<v Speaker 2>I'd rather look fat to mail to do 12 rounds.</v>

2140
01:05:56.080 --> 01:05:56.380
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2141
01:05:56.380 --> 01:05:59.320
<v Speaker 2>he had two more like an Adonis and be fucked off to five.</v>

2142
01:06:00.430 --> 01:06:01.030
<v Speaker 2>No doubt.</v>

2143
01:06:01.030 --> 01:06:03.100
<v Speaker 2>I've knocked out plenty of six bucks in my day.</v>

2144
01:06:03.130 --> 01:06:03.963
<v Speaker 2>Don't worry about that.</v>

2145
01:06:04.930 --> 01:06:05.380
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

2146
01:06:05.380 --> 01:06:07.620
<v Speaker 2>I'm still waiting to be knocked out as a fat pig.</v>

2147
01:06:10.180 --> 01:06:10.660
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2148
01:06:10.660 --> 01:06:12.160
<v Speaker 1>training for Deontay wilder.</v>

2149
01:06:12.190 --> 01:06:12.780
<v Speaker 1>What have you done</v>

2150
01:06:12.780 --> 01:06:13.470
<v Speaker 2>different?</v>

2151
01:06:13.470 --> 01:06:13.981
<v Speaker 2>To be honest,</v>

2152
01:06:13.981 --> 01:06:15.180
<v Speaker 2>we haven't done anything different.</v>

2153
01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:16.433
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2154
01:06:16.800 --> 01:06:17.451
<v Speaker 2>is he the tall?</v>

2155
01:06:17.451 --> 01:06:18.650
<v Speaker 2>As long as guy verified,</v>

2156
01:06:19.230 --> 01:06:20.670
<v Speaker 2>I think [inaudible] has same,</v>

2157
01:06:20.700 --> 01:06:21.533
<v Speaker 2>same size.</v>

2158
01:06:22.470 --> 01:06:23.340
<v Speaker 2>I think glitch come.</v>

2159
01:06:23.350 --> 01:06:25.200
<v Speaker 2>I've had longer arms maybe or maybe not,</v>

2160
01:06:25.201 --> 01:06:26.034
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2161
01:06:26.100 --> 01:06:27.210
<v Speaker 2>But he's up there anyway.</v>

2162
01:06:27.211 --> 01:06:29.700
<v Speaker 2>If he is an ease is the second tallest I've ever fault.</v>

2163
01:06:30.770 --> 01:06:35.610
<v Speaker 2>But every tall guy I've ever faced to tall the better for me.</v>

2164
01:06:36.930 --> 01:06:37.651
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why,</v>

2165
01:06:37.651 --> 01:06:39.780
<v Speaker 2>but I seem to be able to move better than them.</v>

2166
01:06:40.200 --> 01:06:41.220
<v Speaker 2>The Taller and heavier,</v>

2167
01:06:41.580 --> 01:06:45.750
<v Speaker 2>my ideal opponent would be like the tall has anything and heavy because if they</v>

2168
01:06:45.751 --> 01:06:48.720
<v Speaker 2>don't move as quick and the can't turn Gordon and all on the stiff.</v>

2169
01:06:49.090 --> 01:06:51.740
<v Speaker 1>Well what's unusual about you is that you're a tall guy who's,</v>

2170
01:06:51.950 --> 01:06:53.600
<v Speaker 1>who moves like a guy was not tall.</v>

2171
01:06:53.780 --> 01:06:54.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2172
01:06:54.260 --> 01:06:59.260
<v Speaker 1>And that most tog eyes have that advantage of long length and utilization of</v>

2173
01:07:00.081 --> 01:07:00.531
<v Speaker 1>that length.</v>

2174
01:07:00.531 --> 01:07:03.620
<v Speaker 1>They're very good at judging distance and they have that advantage.</v>

2175
01:07:03.860 --> 01:07:08.210
<v Speaker 1>But what you're doing is you're moving around a lot on top of being tall,</v>

2176
01:07:08.450 --> 01:07:10.250
<v Speaker 1>which you could see with Klitschko.</v>

2177
01:07:10.280 --> 01:07:12.950
<v Speaker 1>It was very off putting like right away.</v>

2178
01:07:12.951 --> 01:07:14.960
<v Speaker 1>He didn't know how to fuck with your timing.</v>

2179
01:07:15.500 --> 01:07:16.333
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

2180
01:07:16.380 --> 01:07:16.591
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2181
01:07:16.591 --> 01:07:16.800
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

2182
01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:18.710
<v Speaker 1>that's a giant advantage.</v>

2183
01:07:18.960 --> 01:07:21.030
<v Speaker 2>It is all my life growing up,</v>

2184
01:07:21.031 --> 01:07:24.060
<v Speaker 2>I used to watch all of the great American heavyweight champions of the world.</v>

2185
01:07:25.050 --> 01:07:26.160
<v Speaker 2>We may be in European,</v>

2186
01:07:26.161 --> 01:07:28.710
<v Speaker 2>there's a stigma about European fighters.</v>

2187
01:07:28.711 --> 01:07:29.544
<v Speaker 2>The stiff,</v>

2188
01:07:29.880 --> 01:07:30.840
<v Speaker 2>the can't move.</v>

2189
01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:31.800
<v Speaker 2>They're just strong.</v>

2190
01:07:32.340 --> 01:07:33.173
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>

2191
01:07:33.690 --> 01:07:36.210
<v Speaker 2>I agree 90% of European fighters,</v>

2192
01:07:36.211 --> 01:07:39.260
<v Speaker 2>a stiff robots just doing a lot of conditioning work and left a lot of heavy</v>

2193
01:07:39.261 --> 01:07:40.480
<v Speaker 2>weights and they're going,</v>

2194
01:07:40.510 --> 01:07:41.550
<v Speaker 2>they're trying to do one thing,</v>

2195
01:07:41.551 --> 01:07:44.760
<v Speaker 2>one to left or right and take four or five shots back.</v>

2196
01:07:45.540 --> 01:07:46.321
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to do that.</v>

2197
01:07:46.321 --> 01:07:50.760
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to have European conditioning will American style the best of both</v>

2198
01:07:50.761 --> 01:07:51.594
<v Speaker 2>worlds.</v>

2199
01:07:51.670 --> 01:07:52.860
<v Speaker 2>And I believe that's what I've got.</v>

2200
01:07:53.370 --> 01:07:56.850
<v Speaker 2>I've got the brashness and the movement and the speed of an American fighter,</v>

2201
01:07:57.180 --> 01:07:59.730
<v Speaker 2>but I've got the European conditioning and core strength.</v>

2202
01:08:00.120 --> 01:08:01.170
<v Speaker 2>Best of both worlds.</v>

2203
01:08:02.090 --> 01:08:05.030
<v Speaker 1>Now when you think about a guy like Deontay wilder,</v>

2204
01:08:05.031 --> 01:08:08.480
<v Speaker 1>who's got this wild style and tries to knock you out with every,</v>

2205
01:08:08.630 --> 01:08:09.500
<v Speaker 1>with every punch,</v>

2206
01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:15.410
<v Speaker 1>are you doing anything different without giving away your strategy coming this</v>

2207
01:08:15.411 --> 01:08:15.711
<v Speaker 1>fight?</v>

2208
01:08:15.711 --> 01:08:15.980
<v Speaker 1>Are you</v>

2209
01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:20.570
<v Speaker 2>doing anything different in terms of your preparation or in terms of the way you</v>

2210
01:08:20.820 --> 01:08:22.910
<v Speaker 2>shadow box or move or train?</v>

2211
01:08:23.240 --> 01:08:23.841
<v Speaker 2>Not really,</v>

2212
01:08:23.841 --> 01:08:24.580
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

2213
01:08:24.580 --> 01:08:25.460
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2214
01:08:28.570 --> 01:08:32.260
<v Speaker 2>how can I explain this without sounding like a clown</v>

2215
01:08:33.950 --> 01:08:34.840
<v Speaker 2>or trying your best?</v>

2216
01:08:35.650 --> 01:08:37.960
<v Speaker 2>Don't tie Wilda as a one trick pony.</v>

2217
01:08:39.220 --> 01:08:41.080
<v Speaker 2>I don't need to do anything special to beat him.</v>

2218
01:08:41.260 --> 01:08:42.250
<v Speaker 2>I just need to be myself.</v>

2219
01:08:43.250 --> 01:08:43.690
<v Speaker 2>Jump Tie.</v>

2220
01:08:43.690 --> 01:08:45.790
<v Speaker 2>Wilds is looking for one right hand all night.</v>

2221
01:08:46.060 --> 01:08:47.290
<v Speaker 2>It's a good trick though.</v>

2222
01:08:47.410 --> 01:08:51.180
<v Speaker 2>I said gold trick but we all know what happens when that trek don't lumped.</v>

2223
01:08:51.220 --> 01:08:51.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2224
01:08:51.490 --> 01:08:52.323
<v Speaker 2>you've lost.</v>

2225
01:08:53.540 --> 01:08:54.241
<v Speaker 2>You need mall.</v>

2226
01:08:54.241 --> 01:08:55.300
<v Speaker 2>The one punch to beat me.</v>

2227
01:08:55.301 --> 01:08:57.220
<v Speaker 2>You need to be able to set you up with footwork,</v>

2228
01:08:57.221 --> 01:08:57.641
<v Speaker 2>spade,</v>

2229
01:08:57.641 --> 01:08:59.260
<v Speaker 2>faints movement and he doesn't have any of that.</v>

2230
01:09:00.040 --> 01:09:03.810
<v Speaker 2>If the Great Klitschko I'd excellent footwork and ability to set that big punch</v>

2231
01:09:03.811 --> 01:09:04.644
<v Speaker 2>or couldn't do it.</v>

2232
01:09:05.140 --> 01:09:07.210
<v Speaker 2>What chances as big swing a golf day on it.</v>

2233
01:09:07.840 --> 01:09:09.610
<v Speaker 2>If I get hit by a swinging right Tom,</v>

2234
01:09:09.611 --> 01:09:11.710
<v Speaker 2>does it serve donkey now it's my fault.</v>

2235
01:09:12.340 --> 01:09:13.330
<v Speaker 2>I want it to knock me out.</v>

2236
01:09:13.750 --> 01:09:17.530
<v Speaker 2>If I let wild there swing one of those wild punches from the back of the hall</v>

2237
01:09:17.531 --> 01:09:18.490
<v Speaker 2>and hit me and knocked me out,</v>

2238
01:09:18.510 --> 01:09:20.380
<v Speaker 2>then I'll say thank you very much.</v>

2239
01:09:20.381 --> 01:09:21.550
<v Speaker 2>You put me out of my misery.</v>

2240
01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:27.000
<v Speaker 2>God bless you wilder because obviously I can't be a great fighter that I think I</v>

2241
01:09:27.711 --> 01:09:27.831
<v Speaker 2>am.</v>

2242
01:09:27.831 --> 01:09:29.710
<v Speaker 2>If I'm getting knocked out by swinging punches,</v>

2243
01:09:30.070 --> 01:09:31.360
<v Speaker 2>it's just not possible.</v>

2244
01:09:31.900 --> 01:09:33.310
<v Speaker 2>I don't take big shots anymore.</v>

2245
01:09:33.311 --> 01:09:38.311
<v Speaker 2>Years ago from before pre 2013 I used to take everything dying in the face.</v>

2246
01:09:39.880 --> 01:09:42.040
<v Speaker 2>We'll try and walk through and use my sheer strength,</v>

2247
01:09:42.041 --> 01:09:43.270
<v Speaker 2>size and aggression.</v>

2248
01:09:43.690 --> 01:09:45.820
<v Speaker 2>I'd heart and determination to get through every event.</v>

2249
01:09:46.630 --> 01:09:49.540
<v Speaker 2>But as I stepped up in levels and realized that wasn't going to get me anywhere,</v>

2250
01:09:49.541 --> 01:09:51.700
<v Speaker 2>but a good idea in a good punching in the face.</v>

2251
01:09:52.600 --> 01:09:54.880
<v Speaker 2>So I changed me style to box in a moving,</v>

2252
01:09:55.240 --> 01:09:56.210
<v Speaker 2>slipping and sliding.</v>

2253
01:09:56.220 --> 01:09:59.950
<v Speaker 2>And people have never seen me take any big shots because I'll just ride them</v>

2254
01:10:00.340 --> 01:10:00.640
<v Speaker 2>below.</v>

2255
01:10:00.640 --> 01:10:02.930
<v Speaker 2>Muhammad Ali used to do is take the shots on the gloves,</v>

2256
01:10:03.040 --> 01:10:03.760
<v Speaker 2>go with it.</v>

2257
01:10:03.760 --> 01:10:04.870
<v Speaker 2>Slim slide roll.</v>

2258
01:10:05.290 --> 01:10:07.450
<v Speaker 2>Even as powerful as George form on walls.</v>

2259
01:10:07.480 --> 01:10:08.770
<v Speaker 2>He was the heavy favorite going in,</v>

2260
01:10:08.780 --> 01:10:12.940
<v Speaker 2>knocked out Frazier and Frazier beat early and you had great fights over 15</v>

2261
01:10:12.941 --> 01:10:13.774
<v Speaker 2>rounds.</v>

2262
01:10:13.840 --> 01:10:18.400
<v Speaker 2>It didn't help him in that fight because he used his greatest asset against him.</v>

2263
01:10:19.030 --> 01:10:20.470
<v Speaker 2>And if I can use Deontay wilder,</v>

2264
01:10:20.471 --> 01:10:21.760
<v Speaker 2>his own power against him,</v>

2265
01:10:22.270 --> 01:10:23.103
<v Speaker 2>then I've warm.</v>

2266
01:10:23.410 --> 01:10:24.790
<v Speaker 2>He's looking for one punch.</v>

2267
01:10:24.791 --> 01:10:25.624
<v Speaker 2>I am not.</v>

2268
01:10:25.690 --> 01:10:26.523
<v Speaker 2>So there we go.</v>

2269
01:10:27.090 --> 01:10:27.221
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2270
01:10:27.221 --> 01:10:29.270
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe if he can't run that punch,</v>

2271
01:10:29.271 --> 01:10:30.250
<v Speaker 2>she's lost every round.</v>

2272
01:10:30.750 --> 01:10:31.840
<v Speaker 2>Even he's a promoter.</v>

2273
01:10:31.841 --> 01:10:33.190
<v Speaker 2>Lou Dibella said recently,</v>

2274
01:10:33.670 --> 01:10:34.330
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>

2275
01:10:34.330 --> 01:10:36.490
<v Speaker 2>if he doesn't knock Tyson down or knock him out,</v>

2276
01:10:36.520 --> 01:10:37.660
<v Speaker 2>I don't see how we can win.</v>

2277
01:10:39.070 --> 01:10:39.461
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

2278
01:10:39.461 --> 01:10:40.990
<v Speaker 2>I don't want you looking past this,</v>

2279
01:10:41.440 --> 01:10:45.430
<v Speaker 2>but let's just say you beat Deontay wilder.</v>

2280
01:10:45.640 --> 01:10:46.840
<v Speaker 2>How do you talk?</v>

2281
01:10:46.900 --> 01:10:47.950
<v Speaker 2>Joshua went to a fight.</v>

2282
01:10:48.490 --> 01:10:51.670
<v Speaker 2>I don't because you can take a horse to water,</v>

2283
01:10:51.671 --> 01:10:52.780
<v Speaker 2>but you can't make it drink it.</v>

2284
01:10:53.020 --> 01:10:54.430
<v Speaker 2>So what do you do after this?</v>

2285
01:10:54.490 --> 01:10:55.360
<v Speaker 2>I don't do nothing.</v>

2286
01:10:55.600 --> 01:10:56.171
<v Speaker 2>I sit back,</v>

2287
01:10:56.171 --> 01:10:56.621
<v Speaker 2>retire,</v>

2288
01:10:56.621 --> 01:10:58.000
<v Speaker 2>go up to 450 pounds</v>

2289
01:11:01.230 --> 01:11:02.960
<v Speaker 2>and get back on the drink area.</v>

2290
01:11:04.730 --> 01:11:06.190
<v Speaker 2>What do you do?</v>

2291
01:11:06.191 --> 01:11:06.461
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2292
01:11:06.461 --> 01:11:07.294
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to,</v>

2293
01:11:07.390 --> 01:11:08.890
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to become depressed again.</v>

2294
01:11:08.891 --> 01:11:09.630
<v Speaker 2>You need to go.</v>

2295
01:11:09.630 --> 01:11:10.463
<v Speaker 2>Don't want to,</v>

2296
01:11:10.780 --> 01:11:11.613
<v Speaker 2>what do you do?</v>

2297
01:11:12.080 --> 01:11:13.180
<v Speaker 2>I just got to keep training,</v>

2298
01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:14.850
<v Speaker 2>but like I say,</v>

2299
01:11:14.970 --> 01:11:18.250
<v Speaker 2>I only set one goal our time and I don't care about anything else off of them.</v>

2300
01:11:18.251 --> 01:11:18.991
<v Speaker 2>Beat him wilder.</v>

2301
01:11:18.991 --> 01:11:20.010
<v Speaker 2>And after I beat the wild,</v>

2302
01:11:20.011 --> 01:11:21.670
<v Speaker 2>I probably am going to be depressed to God.</v>

2303
01:11:21.770 --> 01:11:22.220
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2304
01:11:22.220 --> 01:11:23.053
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2305
01:11:23.310 --> 01:11:23.551
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2306
01:11:23.551 --> 01:11:23.761
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2307
01:11:23.761 --> 01:11:24.031
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

2308
01:11:24.031 --> 01:11:24.864
<v Speaker 2>Fuck that.</v>

2309
01:11:24.930 --> 01:11:25.830
<v Speaker 2>Get that out of your head.</v>

2310
01:11:25.831 --> 01:11:26.664
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>

2311
01:11:26.940 --> 01:11:27.601
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know.</v>

2312
01:11:27.601 --> 01:11:28.434
<v Speaker 2>You never know.</v>

2313
01:11:28.590 --> 01:11:29.191
<v Speaker 2>You never know.</v>

2314
01:11:29.191 --> 01:11:30.360
<v Speaker 2>But you can stop yourself.</v>

2315
01:11:30.361 --> 01:11:30.481
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

2316
01:11:30.481 --> 01:11:31.740
<v Speaker 2>you've already brought yourself back.</v>

2317
01:11:31.760 --> 01:11:31.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2318
01:11:31.890 --> 01:11:32.723
<v Speaker 2>I have,</v>

2319
01:11:32.820 --> 01:11:34.350
<v Speaker 2>but you never know what's around the coal on the fear.</v>

2320
01:11:34.351 --> 01:11:36.620
<v Speaker 2>And I don't want to look past Deontay wilder and thinking about what I'm going</v>

2321
01:11:36.621 --> 01:11:37.440
<v Speaker 2>to do after that.</v>

2322
01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:37.950
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2323
01:11:37.950 --> 01:11:38.591
<v Speaker 2>When I won,</v>

2324
01:11:38.591 --> 01:11:39.870
<v Speaker 2>I beat Deontay wilder.</v>

2325
01:11:40.640 --> 01:11:41.371
<v Speaker 2>I want to let him fight.</v>

2326
01:11:41.371 --> 01:11:42.204
<v Speaker 2>Joshua.</v>

2327
01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:44.380
<v Speaker 2>He keeps talking about this Joshua fight.</v>

2328
01:11:44.381 --> 01:11:45.390
<v Speaker 2>It's the one he keeps wanting.</v>

2329
01:11:45.930 --> 01:11:47.190
<v Speaker 2>So I'm going to let him go fight him.</v>

2330
01:11:47.250 --> 01:11:48.090
<v Speaker 2>Go fight each other.</v>

2331
01:11:48.780 --> 01:11:49.613
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>

2332
01:11:49.710 --> 01:11:50.280
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>

2333
01:11:50.280 --> 01:11:51.180
<v Speaker 2>Take one shoals,</v>

2334
01:11:51.540 --> 01:11:52.373
<v Speaker 2>go fight each other.</v>

2335
01:11:52.710 --> 01:11:55.230
<v Speaker 2>Come back in a little free is when you find someone that you think could beat me</v>

2336
01:11:55.231 --> 01:11:55.820
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>

2337
01:11:55.820 --> 01:11:56.160
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2338
01:11:56.160 --> 01:11:57.390
<v Speaker 2>if he beats Joshua,</v>

2339
01:11:57.420 --> 01:11:59.550
<v Speaker 2>that would be spectacular for a rematch,</v>

2340
01:11:59.551 --> 01:11:59.970
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2341
01:11:59.970 --> 01:12:00.211
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2342
01:12:00.211 --> 01:12:01.680
<v Speaker 2>And if he doesn't beat Joshua,</v>

2343
01:12:01.950 --> 01:12:05.400
<v Speaker 2>then it's almost like Joshua kind of has to fight.</v>

2344
01:12:05.840 --> 01:12:07.290
<v Speaker 2>If he doesn't be Joshua say,</v>

2345
01:12:07.320 --> 01:12:07.591
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2346
01:12:07.591 --> 01:12:09.750
<v Speaker 2>It was about a wilder than theory for,</v>

2347
01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:12.390
<v Speaker 2>he didn't throw any punches against the area.</v>

2348
01:12:13.790 --> 01:12:14.490
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2349
01:12:14.490 --> 01:12:15.181
<v Speaker 2>it is what it is,</v>

2350
01:12:15.181 --> 01:12:15.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2351
01:12:15.500 --> 01:12:16.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2352
01:12:16.140 --> 01:12:17.370
<v Speaker 2>you can't please everybody.</v>

2353
01:12:17.371 --> 01:12:19.770
<v Speaker 2>Inboxing and the flight games have pretty fickle game.</v>

2354
01:12:20.370 --> 01:12:22.890
<v Speaker 2>Everybody likes somebody and don't like the next person.</v>

2355
01:12:24.390 --> 01:12:25.223
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

2356
01:12:25.890 --> 01:12:26.551
<v Speaker 2>the way I was saying,</v>

2357
01:12:26.551 --> 01:12:28.440
<v Speaker 2>I saw Roy Jones say something recently,</v>

2358
01:12:28.580 --> 01:12:29.490
<v Speaker 2>I'm on all video.</v>

2359
01:12:29.491 --> 01:12:29.940
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

2360
01:12:29.940 --> 01:12:30.773
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>

2361
01:12:31.230 --> 01:12:33.620
<v Speaker 2>if Jesus Christ himself wasn't liked,</v>

2362
01:12:34.200 --> 01:12:35.500
<v Speaker 2>what chance have I thought?</v>

2363
01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:36.353
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>

2364
01:12:36.420 --> 01:12:37.770
<v Speaker 2>That is so true.</v>

2365
01:12:38.450 --> 01:12:38.730
<v Speaker 2>Roy.</v>

2366
01:12:38.730 --> 01:12:39.660
<v Speaker 2>He's a smart man.</v>

2367
01:12:39.700 --> 01:12:40.381
<v Speaker 2>Hundred percent.</v>

2368
01:12:40.381 --> 01:12:41.220
<v Speaker 2>Very smart man.</v>

2369
01:12:41.430 --> 01:12:42.960
<v Speaker 2>Very great legendary box.</v>

2370
01:12:42.961 --> 01:12:44.970
<v Speaker 2>One of the greatest of all times in my opinion.</v>

2371
01:12:45.060 --> 01:12:45.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2372
01:12:45.770 --> 01:12:46.350
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2374
01:12:48.180 --> 01:12:49.050
<v Speaker 2>you need to get him.</v>

2375
01:12:49.051 --> 01:12:50.760
<v Speaker 2>And he's very knowledgeable on the boxing game.</v>

2376
01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:52.170
<v Speaker 2>Giant fan of that guy.</v>

2377
01:12:52.340 --> 01:12:52.620
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

2378
01:12:52.620 --> 01:12:55.650
<v Speaker 2>I was with a man a couple of months ago about Russia.</v>

2379
01:12:55.710 --> 01:12:57.060
<v Speaker 2>He's a Russian citizen now.</v>

2380
01:12:57.210 --> 01:12:57.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2381

2385
01:13:02.990 --> 01:13:04.800
<v Speaker 2>It must be so good.</v>

2386
01:13:04.801 --> 01:13:05.634
<v Speaker 2>He got his own,</v>

2387
01:13:05.730 --> 01:13:06.720
<v Speaker 2>got a passport.</v>

2388
01:13:07.500 --> 01:13:08.700
<v Speaker 2>But listen man,</v>

<v Speaker 2>and please don't go to 450 pounds.</v>

2396
01:13:17.821 --> 01:13:18.480

2397
01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:19.290
<v Speaker 2>we'll ease.</v>

2398
01:13:19.290 --> 01:13:22.800
<v Speaker 2>I might go to 459 pounds of solid muscle and become Mr Olympia.</v>

2399
01:13:23.340 --> 01:13:23.970
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>
