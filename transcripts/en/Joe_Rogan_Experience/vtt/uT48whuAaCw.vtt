1
00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:04.230
For three.
Whoops,
we've got an issue.

2
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:07.033
<v 1>Gotcha.</v>

3
00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.110
<v 2>Okay.
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay.</v>

4
00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.430
<v 0>Okay.
Here we go.
Five,
four,
three,
two.</v>

5
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.190
Yes.
And we're loud.

6
00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.690
<v 2>Hello Lindsey.
What's happening?
Not much.
Thanks.
Pleasure to meet you.
Yeah,
yeah.</v>

7
00:00:27.691 --> 00:00:28.401
Good to meet you.
I'm,

8
00:00:28.401 --> 00:00:33.000
I'm the girl who tags you in all the disgusting medical history photos and I'm

9
00:00:33.001 --> 00:00:34.770
really looking forward to gross you out.
Your audience

10
00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.150
<v 0>can forward to you doing that as well.</v>

11
00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:42.210
You have a fascinated me with your Twitter page and you like,

12
00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.150
first of all,
how you are a doctor,
right?

13
00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.060
<v 2>Well,
I'm a phd.
I can't save anybody's life.
Perform,
you know,</v>

14
00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.180
Victorian surgery,
amputation or something like anybody can write.
Yeah,
yeah.

15
00:00:54.181 --> 00:00:58.100
Is that a real one?
This is,
this is a prop.
Um,
so this is,

16
00:00:59.030 --> 00:00:59.570
this was a,

17
00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.830
was a real fun thing to get through customs when I was coming in from Britain.

18
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.930
It's a of Victorian amputation saw.
It's called the clockwork saw.
And,

19
00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:10.520
um,
for people who are just listening,
it's a,

20
00:01:10.521 --> 00:01:14.660
it's a circular saw and there would have been a crank that you wound it with and

21
00:01:14.661 --> 00:01:18.350
then you'd release it and it would spin sort of automatically.
Oh God.
Yeah.

22
00:01:18.351 --> 00:01:20.180
And the idea was that it would make it faster.

23
00:01:20.181 --> 00:01:24.350
But the reason why I love this sauce so much is that it was a massive failure.

24
00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.640
And,
um,
I don't think we talk about failure enough in science and medicine.

25
00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.880
You know,
all the things that work,
there's a lot of things that don't work.

26
00:01:31.881 --> 00:01:35.750
And so this guy who invented this saw when he tried it out,

27
00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.250
it was spinning so fast that he took off his assistance fingers.
Oh,
Jesus Christ.

28
00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.710
Oops.
I'm,
it never got out of prototype phase.

29
00:01:42.711 --> 00:01:45.590
So I had to recreate it for my youtube channel.

30
00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.280
<v 0>Now when you were in those old days when they didn't have antibiotics and</v>

31
00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:53.860
antiseptic and,
right,
yeah.

32
00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.810
When they saw someone's leg off or something like that,

33
00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:59.270
how many times those people live?

34
00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.690
<v 2>Well,
you could pull through the operation.
That was one part of it.</v>

35
00:02:03.691 --> 00:02:07.920
But then of course you could die postoperative infection.
So my book,
uh,

36
00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.310
the Patreon are really focuses on this one guy named Joseph Lister,

37
00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.570
who applies germ theory and develops antisepsis.
So germ fighting techniques,

38
00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.530
right.
And most people don't know who he is,
but they know the product.
Listerine.

39
00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.350
So with stream was named after him by,

40
00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.380
I always tell people that.

41
00:02:25.381 --> 00:02:30.381
So basically a lister was a British surgeon and he came to America in 1876 to

42
00:02:30.451 --> 00:02:32.700
convince the medical community of germs.

43
00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.880
And there was a guy in the audience and he decided to create this product.

44
00:02:35.881 --> 00:02:39.210
Listerine.
But it wasn't even a mouthwash in the 19th century.

45
00:02:39.211 --> 00:02:42.240
It was used to treat gonorrhea.
Whoa.
So,

46
00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.330
but also I don't endorse that little blistery and go to a doctor,
man.
Yeah.

47
00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.770
I could just see all the comments already on the youtube,
you know,

48
00:02:49.771 --> 00:02:53.400
she told me to throw with starry night.
No,
I,
I don't endorse that.

49
00:02:53.401 --> 00:02:56.490
And I'm sure the Listerine company is not too pleased at talking about that

50
00:02:56.491 --> 00:02:56.930
either.

51
00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.220
<v 0>So Listerine now just is for breath,</v>

52
00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.240
<v 2>right?
Yeah,
yeah.
It's all it does.
Yeah.
It's,
it's a,</v>

53
00:03:03.241 --> 00:03:06.850
it's an antiseptic mouthwash.
And so even in the good for you,

54
00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.030
like is it good to kill all that stuff inside your mouth?

55
00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.590
Like I'm not a real doctor,

56
00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.220
but you're a medical historian and a medical historian.

57
00:03:14.221 --> 00:03:17.590
I would say that Dennis would say that that was stirring still a good product

58
00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.240
area.
Yeah.
Form of it.
Something like that.
I just use something,

59
00:03:22.241 --> 00:03:25.180
I don't know if it's crap.
The mouthwash.
You got to switch to Listerine now.

60
00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.480
Honor of,
of Joseph Lister.
So how did he know?

61
00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.690
How did he know that there was germs?
That they were real?
So let me,

62
00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.210
let me take you back to sort of before he walks on the scene.

63
00:03:34.211 --> 00:03:35.560
So these operating theaters,

64
00:03:35.561 --> 00:03:37.900
they were filled to the rafters with ticketed spectators.

65
00:03:37.901 --> 00:03:42.140
People actually bought tickets to see someone get their leg hacked off.
Oh No.

66
00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.300
How much does it cost?
You know what?
No one's asked me that.

67
00:03:46.301 --> 00:03:49.800
I don't know how much to take.
It would cost for that,
that spectacle.

68
00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:51.840
Now I really need to look into that.
Um,

69
00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:54.540
but people would pay to watch that they paid for the book.

70
00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.310
What they pay to watch now.
Right.
You know,
we could say,
you know,

71
00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.570
and when I sent you my book,
I signed it and I said,

72
00:04:01.571 --> 00:04:04.660
I thought that being strapped to the Victorian operating theater was the

73
00:04:04.661 --> 00:04:09.040
original fear factor because I can't imagine anything worse than being strapped

74
00:04:09.041 --> 00:04:12.790
to this table.
And so we're talking about before anesthesia,

75
00:04:12.791 --> 00:04:14.570
so you're fully awake.
Um,

76
00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:19.390
and one of my favorite surgeons is this guy named Robert Liston.
He's six two,

77
00:04:19.391 --> 00:04:21.310
he's really tall for the 19th century.

78
00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.610
And he could hold you down with his left arm and you could take your leg off in

79
00:04:24.611 --> 00:04:28.840
about 30 seconds,
which is what you'd want if that's what you'd want.

80
00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.560
But that's still a long time.
It is.
Yeah.
I mean,

81
00:04:32.561 --> 00:04:36.520
if we just sat here for 30 seconds with dead airtime and you could think about

82
00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:39.900
hacking through that light,
and

83
00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.290
I wonder how many people would be at the end of this podcast?

84
00:04:44.291 --> 00:04:48.700
Like five people would be still out there listening.
Um,
so,

85
00:04:48.701 --> 00:04:51.820
so he was incredibly fast.
He was known as the fastest knife in the west end.

86
00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:56.050
He would walk in,
he was a showman.
So we'd walk in and he'd say,
Timey gentlemen.

87
00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.290
And you could just hear the ripple of pocket watches as they came out.

88
00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.990
There he is.
Yup.
There he is.

89
00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:04.811
Yeah.

90
00:05:04.811 --> 00:05:09.550
So actually the list and knife that he invented was this long bladed knife,

91
00:05:09.551 --> 00:05:12.530
which they think jack the ripper may have also used on,

92
00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.820
which is why those rumors are that Jack the ripper may have been a medical

93
00:05:15.821 --> 00:05:20.270
practitioner,
but a really common thought.

94
00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:23.910
Yeah.
I mean,
we're never going to know who he is.
It's unknowable.

95
00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:28.210
We're still kind of obsessed with this.
I've heard so many different versions.

96
00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:31.900
Yeah.
And recently there was some kind of bogus DNA test of,

97
00:05:31.901 --> 00:05:34.960
of a shawl that they side belonged to one of the victims,

98
00:05:34.961 --> 00:05:39.100
but it's impossible to prove the provenance of the object.
But that was,

99
00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:42.010
that was listing.
So he's 62,
he's really tall.
Um,

100
00:05:42.011 --> 00:05:46.960
one of my favorite stories is he would go so fast as he was a switching

101
00:05:46.961 --> 00:05:47.351
instruments,

102
00:05:47.351 --> 00:05:51.310
he'd hold these bloody instruments in his mouth just to illustrate how different

103
00:05:51.311 --> 00:05:55.240
this was.
That's the face I wanted.

104
00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:59.030
I wanted you to speak just totally through this whole segment.
Um,

105
00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:00.800
and as he was switching instruments,

106
00:06:00.801 --> 00:06:02.930
he accidentally caught cutoff is assistance finger.

107
00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:04.670
And then as he was switching instrument,

108
00:06:04.671 --> 00:06:08.480
he slashed the code of a spectator and the assistant died of gangrene.

109
00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:11.960
The patient died of gangrene and the spectator died of fright.

110
00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:15.970
So it's just right.
He died a,
the bright blood.
Wow.

111
00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:17.990
He got slashed in the,

112
00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.380
with the jacket and I guess he had a heart attack from the stress.

113
00:06:21.381 --> 00:06:25.130
And so it's jokingly referred to as the only operation with a 300% mortality

114
00:06:25.131 --> 00:06:28.790
rate.
Did a good job that day.
He killed three,
three people in one.

115
00:06:28.791 --> 00:06:33.370
And you say slashed,
you mean he cut the spectator or just,
no,

116
00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:37.370
he just cut their coat as he was kind of switching instruments and all that took

117
00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:41.780
to kill someone.
I thought people were tougher back then.
Well,
not that guy now.

118
00:06:41.781 --> 00:06:46.070
He lives forever in the butchery in art is that guy had a heart attack.

119
00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:49.970
He must've had a heart attack.
It said he died of fright.
Maybe that wasn't real.

120
00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:55.170
Maybe it was a course shit,
doesn't it?
A little bit.
No,

121
00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:57.930
no,
no,
no,
no.
Of course.
These stories,
you know,
they get,

122
00:06:57.931 --> 00:07:00.950
they get blown out portion.
Yeah.
It just seems like,

123
00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:05.240
did you cut someone's jacket?
I'm going to die.
Well,
it's,
you know,

124
00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:08.300
it's a stressful situation.
People are getting their limbs to hacked off.

125
00:07:08.301 --> 00:07:12.530
You know,
your blood pressure would be really high.
Um,
and the,

126
00:07:12.531 --> 00:07:13.970
and these theaters were,
I mean the,

127
00:07:13.971 --> 00:07:16.760
the floor of the operating theater was crowded as well,

128
00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:19.550
so they'd have to actually clear the forest sometimes.
So you can imagine,

129
00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:22.910
you know,
you're strapped to this and the leg wasn't the worst thing.

130
00:07:22.911 --> 00:07:25.960
So one of the tweets that you shared of mine,
which,
uh,

131
00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:30.840
your platforms seem to enjoy quite a lot and sold me a lot of books,
by the way,

132
00:07:30.841 --> 00:07:32.320
I think you,
I'm awesome.

133
00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:37.330
Was this story about this guy who was suffering from a bladder stone and it got

134
00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:38.750
stuck in his urethra.

135
00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:43.790
And so out of desperation he stuck a nail down his penis and he hammered it to

136
00:07:43.791 --> 00:07:46.580
break it up.
Yeah,
I remember that.
Yeah.
And uh,
yeah,

137
00:07:46.581 --> 00:07:49.200
people went nuts on your platform for that story.
So they,

138
00:07:49.201 --> 00:07:51.880
they obviously are ready for this interview.
How did that work again,

139
00:07:51.881 --> 00:07:54.730
that didn't work right?
It did not work.
Now he died.
Yeah.
Whoops.

140
00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:57.170
That guy definitely died,
but it's,

141
00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:01.610
it really illustrates how desperate people were back then and how few options.

142
00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:02.790
Yeah,
they had,

143
00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:07.240
<v 3>or there's the image of it.
I don't think you'll have to show this tube,
Jamie,</v>

144
00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:11.580
who get back medical.
Yeah,

145
00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:15.430
I'm sure it is medical.
I don't think you could try that on youtube.
Really?

146
00:08:15.431 --> 00:08:16.510
That's clearly a penis.

147
00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:21.700
There's penises and breasts on each mot of penis photos think they look at us

148
00:08:21.701 --> 00:08:25.330
more careful.
All right,
well it's not on there.
I'm just,
okay,
good

149
00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:31.240
for people.
People want to see it.
We'll tweet.

150
00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:33.870
Twitter is the most open of all platforms.

151
00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:36.790
I'll let you get away with almost every that you can have porn on Twitter.
Yeah.

152
00:08:36.791 --> 00:08:39.850
Well,
I mean,
I don't have any problems with Instagram.
I put that stuff up,

153
00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:43.330
but yeah,
but maybe things get removed from Instagram.

154
00:08:43.331 --> 00:08:44.290
It's really kind of interesting.

155
00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:48.790
It seems to be dependent upon how many people complain.
Yeah,

156
00:08:48.791 --> 00:08:52.210
probably there's,
there's always those people out there looking to be offended.

157
00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:56.120
I just think they just want to do something,
they just to press that,
right?
Yeah.

158
00:08:56.170 --> 00:09:00.130
<v 2>Oh,
I'm mad.
[inaudible] there we go.
Yeah,
I know.
I get,
uh,
you know,</v>

159
00:09:00.131 --> 00:09:04.150
at this point there's so many objects that that can cause a fence of course with

160
00:09:04.151 --> 00:09:05.920
medical history and it's,
it's,
you know,

161
00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:09.130
there's a lot of dark history Bodysnatchers and things like that.

162
00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:13.000
And I'm a firm believer that we should tell these stories openly because they

163
00:09:13.001 --> 00:09:16.210
happened in medicine and science grew as a result of it.
But,

164
00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:19.120
but they're not easy subjects to discuss with an audience,

165
00:09:19.121 --> 00:09:21.580
especially when you have so many characters in Twitter and you're,

166
00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:23.620
you're trying to get out of complex idea.
Right,

167
00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:26.650
<v 0>right.
And also like,
you're not just,
gee,</v>

168
00:09:26.651 --> 00:09:29.980
there's a lot of Twitter pages that are fall where people just trying to gross

169
00:09:29.981 --> 00:09:34.250
people out.
You're actually educating people about the history and we,

170
00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:37.860
and we all should be really thankful that these people went through all this

171
00:09:37.861 --> 00:09:39.680
stuff so that we don't have to.

172
00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:42.580
<v 2>Yeah,
absolutely.
I always say to my audience,
so I,</v>

173
00:09:42.581 --> 00:09:46.130
I've been going around the world sort of demolishing romantic notions about

174
00:09:46.131 --> 00:09:46.650
people white,

175
00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:49.460
it might think about what it's like to live in the past because it was pretty,

176
00:09:49.461 --> 00:09:54.220
pretty bad.
And,
um,
I have visuals as well and um,

177
00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:57.570
I've had four men faints so far.
It's always been,
man,

178
00:09:57.571 --> 00:10:01.060
it's just a commentary right now.
It's always been men,
ancestors of the bitch.

179
00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:04.430
Yeah,
exactly.
Cut.
It was bad guy.
Yeah.
Those,

180
00:10:04.431 --> 00:10:06.170
those weekly is coming to my lecture.

181
00:10:06.171 --> 00:10:10.820
And I think what it is though is people think I'm going to see something gross

182
00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:13.700
so I'm not going to eat.
And then their blood sugar plummets.

183
00:10:13.701 --> 00:10:17.390
So it's not really the,
by it.
They're not really prepared,
you know?

184
00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:21.010
And there's an interesting,
yeah.
And they're standing sometimes I'm,
I,

185
00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:24.260
I give lectures at this incredible museum called the old operating theater in

186
00:10:24.261 --> 00:10:25.970
London.
It's the second oldest in the world.

187
00:10:25.971 --> 00:10:29.330
And so you have to stand because it's like a Victorian operating theater.

188
00:10:29.331 --> 00:10:31.460
And so people lock their knees or whatever.

189
00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:36.090
<v 0>Oh,
wow.
So you give actual lectures in the real theaters where they used to.</v>

190
00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:40.870
<v 2>Yeah.
Yeah.
I did my book launch there and um,
if people want to see it,
um,</v>

191
00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:42.070
I filmed sort of a,

192
00:10:42.071 --> 00:10:47.071
like a theatrical scene of a young lister attending an operation in that feeder

193
00:10:48.101 --> 00:10:50.350
and it's on my youtube channel,
conduct under the knife.

194
00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:54.780
And I really want to get this made into a movie.
Um,

195
00:10:54.850 --> 00:10:58.600
I'm trying to come into Hollywood and convince Hollywood that this Quaker

196
00:10:58.630 --> 00:11:02.770
searching from the Victorian period deserves the cinema a feature.

197
00:11:02.771 --> 00:11:07.090
But it is an epic story.
He saved more lives than any other person to ever live.

198
00:11:07.210 --> 00:11:08.810
<v 0>We'll look at it is an epic story.</v>

199
00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:11.240
And for anybody who's ever gone through operations,

200
00:11:11.241 --> 00:11:14.370
and I've gone through several of them,
we owe those people a massive,

201
00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:18.290
<v 2>yeah.
You don't have to be awake strapped to the table.</v>

202
00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:23.240
Both of my knees reconstructed.
Yeah.
Wake up and they're fixed.
Yeah,
it's amazing.

203
00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:25.730
And,
and in the past,
before anesthesia,

204
00:11:25.731 --> 00:11:29.900
a lot of times patients were sat in chairs so they weren't laid down.
Um,

205
00:11:29.901 --> 00:11:33.530
and they were sat in these very high chairs so that their feet dangled so they

206
00:11:33.531 --> 00:11:34.880
couldn't brace against the knife.

207
00:11:34.881 --> 00:11:37.970
If you think about like pushing off with your feet,
of course.
Um,
there's a,

208
00:11:37.971 --> 00:11:42.380
there's a story about a guy named Robert Penman and I know we have images and

209
00:11:42.381 --> 00:11:45.020
I'm sure youtube won't take those down.
Um,
he,

210
00:11:45.021 --> 00:11:47.720
he comes to Robert Liston,

211
00:11:47.721 --> 00:11:49.880
the fastest knife in the west end and the eight and 18,

212
00:11:49.881 --> 00:11:52.970
28 and he has this huge facial tumor growing.
I,

213
00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:57.010
it's been growing for about eight years.
It's taking up his whole face.

214
00:11:57.011 --> 00:12:00.640
He can't breathe now and list and looks at them and says,

215
00:12:00.641 --> 00:12:04.120
I can't do this operation,
which is tantamount to a death sentence.

216
00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:08.950
But he goes up to Scotland and he goes,
there he is.
Wow.
Yeah,
it's,

217
00:12:08.951 --> 00:12:12.010
it's incredible when you see that painting.
Um,

218
00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:17.080
so penman goes up to Scotland and he sees a guy named James Simon sime agrees to

219
00:12:17.081 --> 00:12:22.081
do this operation and permanent sat for 24 minutes in a chair restrained while

220
00:12:22.211 --> 00:12:26.920
this thing is cut out of his face,
drops in a bucket.
And,
and,
um,

221
00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:32.770
yeah,
well we have a picture of them later in life,
you know,
and he looks,

222
00:12:34.270 --> 00:12:37.720
it looks kind of like an ugly Abraham Lincoln and Lincoln wasn't really known

223
00:12:37.721 --> 00:12:41.300
for his looks.
He doesn't have the thing on his face though.
Yeah.

224
00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:45.950
I mean you could see that the jaw is definitely slimmer.
Um,

225
00:12:45.970 --> 00:12:48.850
but he doesn't look too to form considering what he went through.

226
00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:52.960
So it is incredible.
Um,
you get such crazy stories,

227
00:12:52.961 --> 00:12:57.790
like there's a woman who has a mastectomy in 1840 without any anesthetic.

228
00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:01.300
Now at this time,
you would have,
if you were wealthy or if you're a middle class,

229
00:13:01.301 --> 00:13:02.830
you'd have this operation in your home.

230
00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:06.010
You just have it on like your kitchen table,
which is,

231
00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:09.430
which would have been safer than going into the hospitals.
Yeah.

232
00:13:09.431 --> 00:13:12.700
Because the hospitals were crawling with all kinds of infection.

233
00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:15.850
So hospitals were places for the poor.
And um,

234
00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:17.710
to give you an idea of how gross it was,

235
00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:21.310
the bug catcher who had read on the beds of lights,

236
00:13:21.311 --> 00:13:24.910
he was paid more than the doctors and surgeons in this time.
Yeah.
Cause,

237
00:13:24.911 --> 00:13:27.210
I mean that's pretty important,
right?
There's maggots,

238
00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:29.260
all kinds of things crawling around in these hospitals.

239
00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:33.100
So if you are wealthy or middle class,
you had your search and come to your home.

240
00:13:33.101 --> 00:13:37.450
And so she,
uh,
has a surgeon come and the surgeon determines that yes,

241
00:13:37.451 --> 00:13:40.600
the bras has to come off and says,
I'm going to return,

242
00:13:40.601 --> 00:13:44.380
but I'm not going to tell you the day,
which would make me more anxious.

243
00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:46.720
He thought it was going to help her not focus on it,

244
00:13:46.721 --> 00:13:49.720
but all you would be thinking about right is one is this guy and his show up.

245
00:13:49.810 --> 00:13:54.700
That's a person without breasts.
Yeah,
exactly.
He was like,
I'll just show up.

246
00:13:54.701 --> 00:13:56.060
It'll be easy.
Um,

247
00:13:56.090 --> 00:14:00.310
and so he shows up and he goes into her bedroom and he opens his hand and shows

248
00:14:00.311 --> 00:14:04.780
her the knife he's going to use.
And he says to prepare her soul for death.

249
00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:06.820
But this isn't very confidence inspiring.

250
00:14:06.821 --> 00:14:10.030
Any doctors listening don't tell your patients to prepare their soul for depth.

251
00:14:10.630 --> 00:14:13.000
And um,
and she's,
she does survive.

252
00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:18.060
And she talks about how it's so vascular that the blood blinds him at one point.

253
00:14:18.450 --> 00:14:21.970
And so like just when you think it can't get worse,
he can't see and he's under,

254
00:14:22.350 --> 00:14:27.340
um,
she is under his hand for an hour and a half.
He cuts away and she survived.

255
00:14:27.341 --> 00:14:30.700
She and she ends up living a long and somewhat happy life.

256
00:14:30.701 --> 00:14:32.830
I'm sure she had a lot of nightmares.
Yeah.
There we see us.

257
00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:35.440
Do they tie this woman down?
Like how do they oh yeah,

258
00:14:35.441 --> 00:14:37.000
they would have definitely had to restrain her.

259
00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:42.160
I mean people were probably a little bit stronger or more able to adapt to pain

260
00:14:42.791 --> 00:14:46.680
than we are.
But nonetheless,
there would have been some pretty heavy restraint.

261
00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:52.220
That was in the 1840s when cancer common

262
00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:54.230
<v 0>or was it always common human?
Yeah,</v>

263
00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:55.470
<v 2>that's,
that's a good question.</v>

264
00:14:55.471 --> 00:15:00.471
The oldest archeological record I believe is 2000 years old of metastatic

265
00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:04.920
cancers.
So it's older than you think.
There are,
um,

266
00:15:04.950 --> 00:15:07.770
diagnosing head for for centuries and centuries.

267
00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:11.160
I'm not really an expert in history of cancer,
but it is around.

268
00:15:11.161 --> 00:15:14.490
And so with breast cancer,
you know,

269
00:15:14.491 --> 00:15:17.550
probably by the time it got to the stage of mastectomy it probably would have

270
00:15:17.551 --> 00:15:21.390
spread.
If you think about like you know,
it being visible to the naked eye,

271
00:15:21.450 --> 00:15:24.090
but yet she survived.
She did survive.

272
00:15:24.091 --> 00:15:27.150
And so then you have to question whether she had breast cancer or maybe it was

273
00:15:27.151 --> 00:15:30.480
some kind of just like,
yeah,
maybe a cyst.
And she went through that for that.

274
00:15:30.510 --> 00:15:32.490
But yeah,
and again,

275
00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:37.410
before antiseptics before lister comes on and comes up with germ fighting

276
00:15:37.411 --> 00:15:37.951
techniques,

277
00:15:37.951 --> 00:15:41.580
this would have been so dangerous because you have this open cavity and wounds.

278
00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:45.600
And so Joseph Lister,
when he comes up with his antiseptic techniques,

279
00:15:45.601 --> 00:15:49.420
he actually performs a mastectomy on his sister,
on his dining room table.
Oh.

280
00:15:50.370 --> 00:15:52.980
Which,
and she survives.
And that's in the book.
See this,

281
00:15:52.981 --> 00:15:54.570
this would be a great movie,
Don't you think?

282
00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:56.700
<v 0>Do think it would be a great movie.</v>

283
00:15:57.120 --> 00:16:00.990
It's like it would be a great moment for the Cohen Brothers.
Yeah.
Yeah.

284
00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:02.960
Cause it's so chaos Phil.

285
00:16:03.070 --> 00:16:05.980
<v 2>I know.
And all of that kind of grittiness and yeah.</v>

286
00:16:07.290 --> 00:16:12.040
<v 0>Period pieces to yeah,
they could make it more entertaining.
This happen.</v>

287
00:16:12.041 --> 00:16:15.510
Joe.
No Polish,
not a part of that world.

288
00:16:15.930 --> 00:16:19.230
But this guy with the face where they cut that tumor out of his face.

289
00:16:19.231 --> 00:16:22.710
So for 24 minutes,
that's all it took to cut that thing out of his face

290
00:16:22.830 --> 00:16:24.280
<v 2>and that,
that case.
Yeah.</v>

291
00:16:24.281 --> 00:16:26.800
And remember of course it depended on the skill of your surgeon.

292
00:16:26.830 --> 00:16:31.050
So he goes to a very good surgeon named James Syme.
Um,
but there,

293
00:16:31.051 --> 00:16:34.780
there was a story.
So going back to penises,
um,

294
00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:39.240
there's lithotomy as the removal of the stone,
um,
which you saw kind of a,
a,

295
00:16:39.390 --> 00:16:42.670
a demonstration there.
Um,
and it was incredibly painful.

296
00:16:42.671 --> 00:16:45.030
So they stuck a rod down the penis and they cut through the scrotum.

297
00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:46.180
They remove the stone.

298
00:16:46.181 --> 00:16:49.000
And of course there was no pain medication and it was just awful.

299
00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:51.310
Did they drink it?
You know,

300
00:16:51.311 --> 00:16:54.460
it's kind of a myth because of course drinking within your blood.

301
00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:57.100
But someone asked me,
they said,

302
00:16:57.130 --> 00:17:01.720
I heard that surgeons would punch the patient out.
And I was like,
Oh,

303
00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:04.930
you'd have to be really good to knock someone out.

304
00:17:04.931 --> 00:17:07.120
On a first punch and of course you do more damage.

305
00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:08.470
You could do a lot of damage to the hat.

306
00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:11.590
That's definitely didn't happen unless someone can prove me wrong.

307
00:17:11.591 --> 00:17:16.110
Maybe there's like a weird example,
but I've never come across that.
Um,
so,

308
00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:20.680
so it was kind of,
it was you and the surgeon and um,

309
00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:24.580
with the lithotomy it takes about a good surgeon who took about five minutes.

310
00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:26.980
Well,
there's a guy named Steven Polaroid in 18,

311
00:17:26.981 --> 00:17:31.180
28 who goes in to have this done now.
It's incredibly embarrassing.
It's your,

312
00:17:31.181 --> 00:17:33.880
you know,
your naked from the waist down.
It's an embarrassing operation.

313
00:17:33.910 --> 00:17:34.870
It's painful.

314
00:17:35.170 --> 00:17:40.170
He's broadened the theater and the surgeon ends up taking over an hour because

315
00:17:41.201 --> 00:17:45.280
he's so inept and the patient is screaming,
Yo,
please just stop.
Just stop.

316
00:17:45.730 --> 00:17:50.520
And um,
and the surgeon yells back at him for having an abnormal,
which,

317
00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:52.920
how would you like that?
You're sitting there on the,

318
00:17:52.921 --> 00:17:55.260
on the table and you're being blamed for this going wrong.

319
00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:58.410
And he pulls through the operation,
but he does die a post operative infection.

320
00:17:58.950 --> 00:18:02.790
Abnormal anatomy.
How so?
He just said,
you have abnormal anatomy.

321
00:18:02.791 --> 00:18:04.380
And so on the autopsy report,

322
00:18:04.381 --> 00:18:07.470
it was revealed that there was nothing abnormal about his anatomy.

323
00:18:07.471 --> 00:18:12.120
The surgeon just was really announced.
Oh yeah.
It wasn't good blaming the guy.

324
00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:15.470
I did you have lunch before this?
Yeah,
I did,
but I'm all right.
Good.
That's,
well,

325
00:18:15.490 --> 00:18:20.230
that's good because then you won't faint.
Right.
I hosted fear factor for sex.

326
00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:24.570
True.
I've seen everything.
Yeah.
It was nothing.
What's the worst?
I mean,

327
00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:27.450
was there ever a segment on fear factor that you thought,
Ooh,

328
00:18:27.451 --> 00:18:28.680
I don't know if I can watch that.

329
00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:34.300
<v 0>No,
no.
Uh,
uh,
when they had a drink come,
that was rough.</v>

330
00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:37.990
Oh yeah.
That was what got the show cancel.
Yeah.
That was a,

331
00:18:37.991 --> 00:18:42.130
the second version of your factor when it came back for a brief period of time

332
00:18:42.131 --> 00:18:46.570
and they were going way too hard.
They were trying to do themselves further.
Yeah.

333
00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:46.771
Yeah.

334
00:18:46.771 --> 00:18:50.410
They were like fear factors back and it's crazier than ever and they just went

335
00:18:50.411 --> 00:18:54.220
way over the top.
They do a TV.
Right.
You just always pushing the boundaries.

336
00:18:54.221 --> 00:18:57.610
He didn't have to.
Yeah,
because it was just gone with regular fear factor.

337
00:18:57.611 --> 00:19:00.970
And we would have all been fine.
We could do historical fear factor,

338
00:19:01.030 --> 00:19:04.960
we can recreate these sorts of horrible things.
It was a blessing in disguise.

339
00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:10.330
But,
um,
this,
this surgery as we know it,

340
00:19:10.450 --> 00:19:12.190
when did it first start?

341
00:19:12.370 --> 00:19:17.370
Like what is the first historical recounting of an actual doctor?

342
00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:23.780
<v 2>Oh,
or you mean on someone?
Someone saying they're a licensed doctor.</v>

343
00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:27.860
When did it start?
Like,
like really hard questions.
Oh,
I'm sorry.
No,
no,

344
00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:32.230
I know so little about history.
I,
it's like 19th,
18th century.
Um,
it's,
it,

345
00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:35.390
you know,
we have evidence again in the archaeological records of,

346
00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:40.430
of surgical procedures going far back.
But who did them?
They would have been,

347
00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:43.770
um,
you know,
sometimes why they called him wise women comedy.

348
00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:48.620
Connie women on barber surgeons.
So one of my,
yeah,

349
00:19:48.621 --> 00:19:52.240
with the borrower.
Very good at razors,
right?
Yes.
Yeah.

350
00:19:52.250 --> 00:19:54.830
Actually Barber surgeons used to do things like pull your teeth.

351
00:19:54.831 --> 00:19:58.250
They used to blog wet.
And so the Barber Pole,

352
00:19:58.251 --> 00:20:02.330
which is right in white is right and white because it was advertising their

353
00:20:02.331 --> 00:20:04.610
services is blood ladders.
So what they would do,

354
00:20:04.690 --> 00:20:08.240
they would tie these bloody rags around the pole and it would whip around the

355
00:20:08.241 --> 00:20:13.210
pole.
I know it's one of my favorite stories.
And um,
and the,

356
00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:17.270
the ball at the top represented the bowl that would catch the blood and the

357
00:20:17.271 --> 00:20:20.600
stick would have been the stick that you held to kind of get your veins to stick

358
00:20:20.601 --> 00:20:22.760
out and people were blood let for all kinds of reasons.

359
00:20:22.761 --> 00:20:25.310
Like you would do it like a purge or a diet or,

360
00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:28.010
or you would do it because you were ill.
Um,

361
00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:31.580
the idea being that you had produced too much blood and you needed the blood to

362
00:20:31.581 --> 00:20:34.310
be let to kind of restore balance in your body.

363
00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:37.550
<v 0>What do you think it would be like to go back in time and hear someone say</v>

364
00:20:37.551 --> 00:20:41.990
something that's stupid?
Like,
you're sick.
We need to remove some of your blood.

365
00:20:41.991 --> 00:20:45.410
Do you have too much blood in your system?
You're going to show,

366
00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:48.070
you're going to send all of these like crazy historians who are like,

367
00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:52.810
<v 2>we can't.
Yeah,
there you go.
There's,
you got the tons Sorial services.</v>

368
00:20:52.811 --> 00:20:57.670
What does that mean?
And you know what else the barber shop quartet comes from?

369
00:20:57.671 --> 00:21:01.870
The idea that the barber surgeons often had a musical loot in the office that

370
00:21:01.871 --> 00:21:06.160
you would play or the patient would play was like a musical therapy.
Um,

371
00:21:06.161 --> 00:21:09.940
so there's all kinds of hangovers from it.
And you know the demon barber,

372
00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.520
a Sweeney Todd.
Yeah.
So this is kind of a,

373
00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:15.970
one of these stories that pops up and they think that it might be that medical

374
00:21:15.971 --> 00:21:18.100
practitioners,
we're trying to um,

375
00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:21.040
undermine the legitimacy of the barbers.

376
00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:23.710
So you kind of either get this story that the barber,

377
00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:27.520
is this like sort of demon figure who's chopping you up and selling you in

378
00:21:27.521 --> 00:21:29.950
making you into pies?
Or

379
00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:33.100
<v 0>is that a legit one?
Because that seems like nonsense.</v>

380
00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:36.110
Well it seems like it's a recreation of it seem older one cause,

381
00:21:36.170 --> 00:21:39.940
well it seems like parody.
Like,
look,
it says,
listen to my troubles.
No charge.

382
00:21:39.941 --> 00:21:43.430
Listen to your troubles.
50 cents.
They might've had that on there.
Barbered thing.

383
00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:47.380
When they're cutting bolts out of you,
it's as bullets removed.
Two Bucks.

384
00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:50.440
I don't know.
They're all drunk.
Pomade,
mustache wax.

385
00:21:51.230 --> 00:21:55.470
<v 2>Yeah.
People,
people thought that bullets were,
uh,
that gun powder was poisonous.</v>

386
00:21:55.471 --> 00:21:59.370
So a surgeon would often amputate if you were shot.
Oh God.

387
00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:03.720
Until they kind of realize that sometimes it was okay to just keep the bullet in

388
00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:06.060
depending on,
on where it was.

389
00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:10.830
But it could just be like a recreation of something that someone found maybe.

390
00:22:10.890 --> 00:22:14.910
And there's selling that as a piece maybe,
right?
Probably.
Yeah.
Yeah.

391
00:22:14.911 --> 00:22:19.860
And we get the,
we get the red,
blue and white barber polls now.

392
00:22:19.950 --> 00:22:23.370
So what happened was the barber surgeons and the surgeons split off

393
00:22:23.371 --> 00:22:26.130
professionally at some point in history.

394
00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:29.700
And so the surgeons start to use blue and white poles and the barber's used

395
00:22:29.701 --> 00:22:32.160
right.
And White Poles.
And I think now the red,

396
00:22:32.161 --> 00:22:35.640
white and blue is like the patriotic red,
white and blue.
But,

397
00:22:35.641 --> 00:22:38.580
but the traditional barber pole would have been right in white and it would have

398
00:22:38.581 --> 00:22:41.880
signified that you could come in and get your blood lighting because those,

399
00:22:41.881 --> 00:22:45.190
those bloody rags would have been out there on the pole.
Um,

400
00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:46.590
before they had the pole,

401
00:22:46.591 --> 00:22:50.170
they would advertise by putting just bowls of congealed blood in the window.
Oh.

402
00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:55.080
And then in London they decided,
I think it was about the 14th century,

403
00:22:55.081 --> 00:22:56.640
they said no more of that.

404
00:22:56.641 --> 00:22:58.770
So the barbers started to throw the blood into the river,

405
00:22:58.771 --> 00:23:00.920
which was also equally gross.
Yeah.

406
00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:04.280
So the barber surgeons would have definitely,
um,

407
00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:07.380
been doing minor surgical procedures and they would have been more affordable

408
00:23:07.381 --> 00:23:10.030
than the surgeons and the physicians themselves.
Um,

409
00:23:10.170 --> 00:23:14.880
but nobody could really do much for you in that period according to our own sort

410
00:23:14.881 --> 00:23:19.470
of 21st and unders,
you know,
it's 21st century understanding.
Um,
but I always say,

411
00:23:19.471 --> 00:23:22.530
to go back to your question about,
you know,
um,

412
00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:27.060
how would it feel to hear something so dumb?
Well,
what do you think today that,

413
00:23:27.061 --> 00:23:29.850
you know,
in a hundred years we're going to look back at and there's,

414
00:23:29.851 --> 00:23:32.760
there's definitely going to be stuff,
right,
that we're going to look back and go,

415
00:23:32.761 --> 00:23:36.390
I can't believe that,
you know,
we used to see that.
In fact,
I,

416
00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:39.960
I think that this is probably going to get people to go,
no,
that totally works.

417
00:23:39.961 --> 00:23:44.490
You know,
that,
that,
um,
uh,
trend of copying.
Yeah.
Now that you see,

418
00:23:44.491 --> 00:23:47.480
so that also it's 17th century.
So they would cop,

419
00:23:47.481 --> 00:23:50.150
they would have these heated cops and they would create this blister and then

420
00:23:50.151 --> 00:23:53.390
they would cut it open with this really sharp instrument and that's how they

421
00:23:53.391 --> 00:23:56.480
would bleed you.
So it's kind of this weird thing that's coming back,

422
00:23:56.481 --> 00:23:58.100
but for slightly different reasons.

423
00:23:58.130 --> 00:24:01.580
I don't think there's any evidence of comping is real.
No,

424
00:24:01.610 --> 00:24:02.870
I don't think so either.
And I,

425
00:24:02.871 --> 00:24:05.480
and I like to point people to the past because if we're going to make fun of,

426
00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:06.830
you know,
what they were doing in the past,

427
00:24:06.831 --> 00:24:10.240
it's kind of making a reappearance so to speak.
Um,

428
00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:15.260
but people do all kinds of weird things now too.
Like they eat the placenta.

429
00:24:16.250 --> 00:24:19.640
There's,
I,
there is no medical evidence that,
that has any kind of health benefit.

430
00:24:20.220 --> 00:24:24.020
It's edible oil.
Yeah.
Can eat it.
Well,

431
00:24:24.021 --> 00:24:27.680
it's funny because that actually segues into,
into this lovely object,

432
00:24:27.681 --> 00:24:31.250
this half skull here.
My friend Zane Wylie creates these,

433
00:24:31.251 --> 00:24:34.430
these are actually cereal bowls.
But,
uh,

434
00:24:34.431 --> 00:24:38.720
and the reason why I brought it was because it opens up a conversation about

435
00:24:38.721 --> 00:24:40.970
something that I like to talk about,
which is corpse Madison.

436
00:24:40.971 --> 00:24:45.810
So people used to actually eat dead bodies for medicinal purposes.
Um,

437
00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:49.610
so if you had epilepsy and the early modern period,

438
00:24:49.611 --> 00:24:53.040
so when we were like talking like 16th,
17th,
18th centuries,
um,

439
00:24:53.150 --> 00:24:56.440
people would drink the blood of an executed criminals.

440
00:24:56.500 --> 00:25:00.800
Someone who lost their head.
Like the idea was that the life cut short,

441
00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:05.510
that the blood was very powerful force.
And so you get these sort of,
um,

442
00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:08.450
drawings of people gathered at the scaffold.
You know,

443
00:25:08.451 --> 00:25:10.160
this poor pastor's going to lose his head.

444
00:25:10.161 --> 00:25:12.830
And these people were like holding cups up to catch the blood.

445
00:25:13.610 --> 00:25:17.630
And it didn't work in epilepsy was so awful because it was so misunderstood.

446
00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:22.310
And you can imagine,
you know,
when someone goes into a seizure,
it's,
it's,

447
00:25:22.311 --> 00:25:25.610
um,
it's scary.
And if you don't understand what's happening,

448
00:25:25.611 --> 00:25:29.490
you could think that it's witchcraft or there's all kinds of things that,
um,

449
00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:32.660
people thought about that disease.
So these people were quite desperate,

450
00:25:32.661 --> 00:25:37.350
so they were drinking the blood of executed criminals.
They ground up,
um,

451
00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:41.990
mummy's ancient mummies and they would make it into pills and did all kinds of

452
00:25:41.991 --> 00:25:45.620
things.
Right.
So I,
so I always point this out,
we eat the placenta today.

453
00:25:45.621 --> 00:25:50.480
It's kind of like,
you know,
a form of I'm ingesting bodily.

454
00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:55.070
Yeah.
See,
there you go.
Yeah.
So people were just super,

455
00:25:55.071 --> 00:25:58.310
super desperate back then.
Yeah.
I mean,

456
00:25:58.340 --> 00:26:01.310
of course there was not much that could be done right.
But,

457
00:26:01.490 --> 00:26:04.670
but we do some kind of form of corporate medicine and organ donation.

458
00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:07.040
So we're taking dead body parts were not eating them,

459
00:26:07.041 --> 00:26:10.130
but we're taking them into our body to cure ourselves.

460
00:26:11.210 --> 00:26:14.990
Cadaver graft on my right knee.
Oh yeah.
I have one in my jaw.

461
00:26:16.130 --> 00:26:21.130
I had,
well,
I had a guy,
a huge fist fight and no,
um,
I had,

462
00:26:21.131 --> 00:26:21.620
uh,

463
00:26:21.620 --> 00:26:26.240
some gum disease up here and then they had to like graphed a little light piece

464
00:26:26.241 --> 00:26:30.020
of cadaver bone,
but they don't call it cadaver bone.
Did they call it,

465
00:26:30.021 --> 00:26:34.200
get everyone to you?
Don't they call it freeze dry bone or something?
No,

466
00:26:34.201 --> 00:26:37.130
it wasn't bone.
It was a,
they call it an Allo graft.

467
00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:39.260
It's a cadaver.

468
00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:44.040
The use the Achilles tendon for the ACL because the Achilles tendon

469
00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:48.360
<v 0>is much larger than an ACL.
So it's stronger and if you don't,</v>

470
00:26:48.570 --> 00:26:51.870
are you familiar with the way it works is really kind of interesting the way it

471
00:26:51.871 --> 00:26:53.670
works.
It's not like it takes over,

472
00:26:54.590 --> 00:26:56.620
it sound like an organ transplant so you don't,

473
00:26:56.680 --> 00:26:59.070
you don't have to worry about your body rejecting it in the same way.

474
00:26:59.071 --> 00:26:59.761
Although some people,

475
00:26:59.761 --> 00:27:03.380
sometimes people's bodies don't accept it or it doesn't work,
but um,

476
00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:07.800
they ticked this graft,
they put this new tendon in place,

477
00:27:08.010 --> 00:27:09.870
this new a ligament in place rather,

478
00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:15.080
and then your body re proliferates that ligament with cell.

479
00:27:15.191 --> 00:27:19.650
So it's,
even though it will feel like it's healed up within like a month or two,

480
00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:22.020
like you're,
you're Neil feel a little bit weak from the surgery,

481
00:27:22.290 --> 00:27:25.230
but people get a distorted perception of how strong it actually is.

482
00:27:25.231 --> 00:27:28.350
And fighters in particular,

483
00:27:28.351 --> 00:27:31.980
I know several fighters who have wound up reinjuring their need because they

484
00:27:31.981 --> 00:27:36.150
thought it was okay.
I'm real.
Really.
It was very gummy and very weak.

485
00:27:36.151 --> 00:27:39.910
So how long does it take to heal before like six months.
Yeah.

486
00:27:40.590 --> 00:27:42.420
Like six to nine months.
They recommend,

487
00:27:42.590 --> 00:27:44.690
<v 2>but it's amazing what we can do now.</v>

488
00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:49.300
I know incredible about 150 years ago that I'm talking about and today.
Yeah.

489
00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:53.720
It's just the,
and,
and I always,
because I'm a big Joseph Lister Fan,

490
00:27:53.721 --> 00:27:56.660
I always say that if we hadn't understood germs,

491
00:27:56.720 --> 00:28:00.350
there would be no way to go deep into the body would there.
Sure.
Yeah.
Um,

492
00:28:00.410 --> 00:28:04.320
and so he opens up this sort of huge field with Madison and a lot of advanced,

493
00:28:04.350 --> 00:28:08.390
uh,
advancements are made off the back of it.
But,
um,
but it was,

494
00:28:08.391 --> 00:28:11.870
it was a gritty time and um,
it definitely,

495
00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:16.160
you definitely could die very easily.
Life was very cheap back then.

496
00:28:16.670 --> 00:28:17.390
<v 0>Yeah.
I mean,</v>

497
00:28:17.390 --> 00:28:21.800
I can only imagine just the idea that woman getting her breasts removed on her

498
00:28:21.801 --> 00:28:22.640
kitchen table.

499
00:28:22.770 --> 00:28:26.760
<v 2>Yeah.
There was another,
there was a little boy,
he was 12 years old.</v>

500
00:28:26.761 --> 00:28:27.900
His name was Henry pays.

501
00:28:27.930 --> 00:28:31.590
And he was told by the surgeon he had to have his leg removed and he sighed as

502
00:28:31.591 --> 00:28:33.480
little kids do,
would it hurt?

503
00:28:33.510 --> 00:28:36.710
And the surgeon said no more than having a tooth polled.
Oh cool.

504
00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:38.460
So he was very unprepared.

505
00:28:38.461 --> 00:28:41.280
So they brought him into the operating theater and he was so awake.

506
00:28:41.310 --> 00:28:44.760
And so where he remembers counting six strokes of the saw before is a little leg

507
00:28:44.761 --> 00:28:48.570
fell off.
Why?
They have to cut his leg off.
He broke it and

508
00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:54.000
it was just a sprain and they just decided to take it off.
No,

509
00:28:54.001 --> 00:28:55.470
I mean if there was a compound fracture,

510
00:28:55.471 --> 00:28:58.950
the chances of it on becoming infected was quite high.

511
00:28:59.250 --> 00:29:02.850
So when lister comes along and he's trying to figure out what's causing the

512
00:29:02.851 --> 00:29:03.361
infection,

513
00:29:03.361 --> 00:29:06.810
he notices that if it's a clean break and there's no break in the skin,

514
00:29:06.811 --> 00:29:09.660
usually it heals.
Okay.
But if there's a break in the skin,

515
00:29:09.661 --> 00:29:13.230
it gets infected and usually it leads to some kind of gang green or septicemia.

516
00:29:13.770 --> 00:29:15.360
And that's how he starts to wonder.

517
00:29:15.361 --> 00:29:19.470
It must be something coming from outside and getting into this wound that is

518
00:29:19.471 --> 00:29:21.660
causing the infection.

519
00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:25.290
But he breeds Louis Pasteur's germ theory and this is how he starts to put it

520
00:29:25.291 --> 00:29:28.350
together.
But when he first comes out with it,
you know,

521
00:29:28.530 --> 00:29:32.160
there's a lot of pushback because medicine and science are essentially

522
00:29:32.161 --> 00:29:36.330
conservative in the sense that it's like puzzle solving.

523
00:29:36.510 --> 00:29:38.000
If someone,
you know,
you,

524
00:29:38.001 --> 00:29:40.710
you solve the puzzle within the rules that are already set out.

525
00:29:40.711 --> 00:29:44.740
If someone from sort of the fringe and has this wild idea,

526
00:29:44.741 --> 00:29:46.010
usually there's a lot of pushback.

527
00:29:46.150 --> 00:29:48.070
And so that's exactly what happens with lister.

528
00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:52.150
And it's hard for us to imagine because germs,
we understand them today,

529
00:29:52.151 --> 00:29:53.260
it seems obvious to us,

530
00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:57.910
but back then a surgeon didn't wash his hands or his instruments because why

531
00:29:57.911 --> 00:30:00.400
would he wash his hands or his instruments if they were going to get dirty with

532
00:30:00.401 --> 00:30:03.250
the next patient?
So you have to get into the mind,

533
00:30:03.251 --> 00:30:07.990
the logical mind of a Victorian surgeon.
They were aprons.

534
00:30:07.991 --> 00:30:11.530
I think Jamie,
I'd also send a picture of like a surgeon with,
with his apron on.

535
00:30:11.770 --> 00:30:16.040
Actually it's a picture of a butcher.
Um,
but it gives you that kind of idea of,

536
00:30:16.041 --> 00:30:19.840
of what your friendly Victorian surgeon would have been wearing and um,

537
00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:22.690
that apron,
the more blood it had on it,

538
00:30:22.691 --> 00:30:26.890
it was like a sign of pride almost because that meant that your surgeon was very

539
00:30:26.891 --> 00:30:31.880
experienced and have the bottom a lot of it.
That is a butcher.
Yeah.

540
00:30:32.250 --> 00:30:34.670
Tools.
The trade.
Yep.
Similar tools.
And,

541
00:30:34.750 --> 00:30:39.700
and certainly that apron would have been on your surgeon.
Yeah,
I know.

542
00:30:39.701 --> 00:30:43.510
It's kind of like gangs of New York,
you know,
you kind of,
you kind of picture,

543
00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:48.400
they would warn those really tall top hats and um,
those crazy plaid colors.

544
00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:48.731
And it's,

545
00:30:48.731 --> 00:30:52.840
it's a very colorful time before Victoria course plunges the nation into
morning,

546
00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:56.490
um,
later.
So listers coming in along the 1840 [inaudible].

547
00:30:56.491 --> 00:30:58.870
It's very sort of colorful and filthy and dirty.

548
00:30:58.900 --> 00:31:03.290
And the choice in the morning when her husband died,
um,

549
00:31:03.310 --> 00:31:05.950
she went into sort of lifetime morning.

550
00:31:05.980 --> 00:31:10.660
So she's always wearing black for the rest of her life and everybody follows her

551
00:31:10.661 --> 00:31:14.380
example.
So we think of the Victorians wearing sort of all that black,

552
00:31:14.381 --> 00:31:15.430
but in gangs of New York,

553
00:31:15.610 --> 00:31:17.890
a lot of people thought that that was sort of an imagined world,

554
00:31:17.891 --> 00:31:19.480
but actually that's what they would've looked like.

555
00:31:19.481 --> 00:31:22.060
They would have been wearing those plaids and those bright colors and those top

556
00:31:22.061 --> 00:31:25.780
hats.
But lister was a Quaker,
we think of like Quaker oats,

557
00:31:25.781 --> 00:31:27.870
which is kind of accurate.
Um,

558
00:31:27.871 --> 00:31:31.210
and he would have been wearing sort of black and white and very dull colors.

559
00:31:31.390 --> 00:31:34.540
So when I think about this movie,
because I think about it a lot,

560
00:31:34.541 --> 00:31:39.100
I think about sort of this world being very hedonistic and colorful and there's

561
00:31:39.101 --> 00:31:42.790
a lot of drugs going on 'em they're discovering ether and all kinds of things

562
00:31:42.791 --> 00:31:43.840
that they're experimenting with.

563
00:31:43.841 --> 00:31:48.770
And then you have this somber Quaker and as the movie sort of progresses,

564
00:31:48.790 --> 00:31:51.340
the world catches up and gets a bit cleaner with lister.

565
00:31:51.430 --> 00:31:55.570
So they were experimenting with all these drugs?
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.
It was like,

566
00:31:56.140 --> 00:31:59.140
it was just a crazy time.
So ether is,

567
00:31:59.170 --> 00:32:04.170
so my book begins with the first operation under anesthesia.

568
00:32:04.510 --> 00:32:07.750
And I wanted to start there because I think if anybody has ever thought about

569
00:32:07.751 --> 00:32:08.471
the history of surgery,

570
00:32:08.471 --> 00:32:11.260
which they might not have until they turned into this podcast,

571
00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:14.410
they tend to think of that moment.
That's the big moment.

572
00:32:14.830 --> 00:32:19.120
But actually surgery becomes much more dangerous because the surgeon still

573
00:32:19.121 --> 00:32:22.840
doesn't understand germs,
but he doesn't have the patient fighting him anymore.

574
00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:26.230
So He's more willing to pick up the knife and go deeper in the body.

575
00:32:26.231 --> 00:32:28.960
And so postoperative infection rises and it,

576
00:32:28.961 --> 00:32:31.570
and it opens with the Great Robert Liston.

577
00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:36.600
And he performed the first operation under ether in 1846 in London.

578
00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:40.250
And um,
and he doesn't think it's going to work.
It comes from America.

579
00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:43.370
He calls it the Yankee Dodge.
Um,
and it's a miracle.

580
00:32:43.371 --> 00:32:47.750
It works in the age of agony is over.
When ether was discovered,

581
00:32:47.751 --> 00:32:50.870
everybody wanted to try it.
That's drug that made you insensible.

582
00:32:50.871 --> 00:32:51.830
What was that like?

583
00:32:51.831 --> 00:32:55.760
And so you get these kinds of stories of medical students sniffing it and

584
00:32:55.761 --> 00:32:58.250
drinking it.
In fact,
I believe there's still a place in London.

585
00:32:58.251 --> 00:33:02.630
You can get an ether cocktail again.
I don't,
I don't endorse it.

586
00:33:02.631 --> 00:33:04.400
It's highly flammable.

587
00:33:04.670 --> 00:33:07.760
So people also smoked a lot in operating theaters.

588
00:33:07.761 --> 00:33:12.090
So you can imagine that there were a lot of gather a lot of accidents,
but,

589
00:33:12.300 --> 00:33:15.360
but you drop it on a basically because it evaporates really quickly.

590
00:33:15.361 --> 00:33:18.020
You drop it on a strawberry and then you dunk it into champagne and it's

591
00:33:18.021 --> 00:33:22.610
supposed to get you really high very quickly and then it wears off equally

592
00:33:22.611 --> 00:33:26.540
quickly.
I tried to convince my publisher to have ether cocktails book launch,

593
00:33:26.541 --> 00:33:31.100
but they were like,
just have a bunch of Uber's ready.
Yeah,
exactly.
Yeah.

594
00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:35.600
Or carriage is like in the Victorian.
Um,
so,
so people were,
yeah,

595
00:33:35.601 --> 00:33:38.780
definitely trying.
And then of course I have not tried it.

596
00:33:38.810 --> 00:33:39.920
I haven't found that bar.
Yeah.

597
00:33:40.730 --> 00:33:42.490
<v 0>Experiment on the people that came to your book.</v>

598
00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:47.550
<v 2>Wow.
That'd be the best thing.
Great Story.
You know,
instead of people.</v>

599
00:33:49.350 --> 00:33:52.810
Yeah.
Maybe,
maybe try it out maybe for the next book.

600
00:33:54.010 --> 00:33:58.390
But uh,
yeah.
And so,
so you have ether in sort of the mid 19th century,

601
00:33:58.391 --> 00:34:03.220
and then of course later you have cocaine.
You have on opium,
which is,

602
00:34:03.290 --> 00:34:07.500
um,
well actually cocaine comes along and is presented as sort of a,

603
00:34:07.510 --> 00:34:12.460
a cure to the opiate,
the morphine addiction.
So like take cocaine instead.

604
00:34:12.940 --> 00:34:17.350
And I had brought,
it's in my Mary Poppins bag.
Um,
I'll show it to you later.

605
00:34:17.351 --> 00:34:17.831
After the show,

606
00:34:17.831 --> 00:34:21.760
I brought a postcard that shows a dentist and he's pulling a tooth and the

607
00:34:21.761 --> 00:34:25.750
person wrote underneath,
just had a tooth pulled with cocaine.
So they were,

608
00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:29.500
they were using it for all kinds of things and doctors were becoming addicted

609
00:34:29.501 --> 00:34:33.190
themselves to these drugs.
Um,
then heroin comes along,

610
00:34:33.191 --> 00:34:36.790
they're invents heroin,
heroin is given to your children.

611
00:34:36.791 --> 00:34:41.230
It's putting all kinds of things.
Again,
it's,
um,
it's positioned as,
you know,

612
00:34:41.500 --> 00:34:44.290
break your cocaine addiction now with heroin.
So it just,

613
00:34:44.291 --> 00:34:47.770
it wasn't just a crazy period and it was really in sort of in the early 20th

614
00:34:47.771 --> 00:34:51.490
century when a lot of this stuff's starting to be regulated finally.
Wow.

615
00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:55.400
I didn't bring any of that with me.
I believe

616
00:34:55.400 --> 00:35:00.200
<v 0>there was a mummy that was found in ancient Egypt that tested positive for</v>

617
00:35:00.201 --> 00:35:01.910
cocaine.
Oh.

618
00:35:01.970 --> 00:35:06.950
But they think that it might be a false positive because apparently there's

619
00:35:06.951 --> 00:35:10.700
something else that they would consume back then that would make you test

620
00:35:10.701 --> 00:35:15.050
positive for cocaine.
I don't know.
Yeah,
Jamie,
you'll find it.
But there was,

621
00:35:15.051 --> 00:35:19.630
it was some,
it was some Evans.
I think what they were trying to connect is to it.

622
00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:19.851
Now.

623
00:35:19.851 --> 00:35:24.851
I remember they were trying to connect this to the idea that people from Egypt

624
00:35:25.221 --> 00:35:30.221
had the ability to travel to the Americas and that someone from here it goes,

625
00:35:31.190 --> 00:35:34.370
American drugs in ancient Egyptian mummies can make it a little larger.

626
00:35:34.371 --> 00:35:38.280
Pluse it says,
it seems safe to say Blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

627
00:35:38.490 --> 00:35:42.630
In 1992,
a new study of nine mummies from ancient Egypt created quite a stir.

628
00:35:42.631 --> 00:35:45.900
When is announced the discovery traces of nicotine and cocaine in their hair.

629
00:35:46.350 --> 00:35:49.800
Both of these chemicals came from plants found only in South America.

630
00:35:49.801 --> 00:35:53.880
And this research has since been touted as evidence of Pre-colombian contact

631
00:35:53.881 --> 00:35:55.080
between American Africa.

632
00:35:55.090 --> 00:35:58.650
Something thought to be impossible based on the rest of the archeological
record.

633
00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:02.550
So what's going on?
Let's start by looking at the evidence.
Uh,
Buh Buh,

634
00:36:02.551 --> 00:36:07.551
Buh Buh Buh [inaudible] to the perform buys of Svelte da Ba Blah ba Nova and

635
00:36:10.801 --> 00:36:12.450
two,
that's a serious woman.

636
00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:17.370
And two of her colleagues at the Institute for Anthropology and,

637
00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:19.080
well this is,
uh,
in Munich,

638
00:36:19.110 --> 00:36:24.110
they're using German words for anthropology probably in humanities of university

639
00:36:24.511 --> 00:36:27.970
in Munich,
a tests were carried out by nine mummies,
uh,

640
00:36:27.990 --> 00:36:32.990
on nine mammies Munich museum dating from a 170 to 395 BC.

641
00:36:34.321 --> 00:36:38.190
This study focused on hair samples,
which are offering used to,
uh,

642
00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:43.220
assess drug concentrations in the body due to do the results.

643
00:36:43.530 --> 00:36:44.363
Was it,
so here,

644
00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:47.430
what they discovered all the mommies tested positive for cocaine and hashish,

645
00:36:47.460 --> 00:36:52.020
which makes sense.
The results caused an immediate stir with the,
c'mon,

646
00:36:52.021 --> 00:36:55.020
let's cut to the chase here folks.
First thing to say,

647
00:36:55.021 --> 00:36:56.880
archeologist and not just being stubborn about this,

648
00:36:57.120 --> 00:37:00.540
they're many reasons not to think the traces of drugs and nine mummies means

649
00:37:00.660 --> 00:37:04.880
what does it,
what does it conclusion?
Cut to the chase.
He parks.
Yeah.

650
00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:09.660
Nicotine.
Cocaine.
Okay.
Back Up.
Back Up.
Cocaine.
Stop.

651
00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:11.100
Okay.
Cocaine.

652
00:37:11.101 --> 00:37:13.860
Most of the thing of today was first discovered early civilizations,

653
00:37:14.310 --> 00:37:18.900
the Andean region of South America,
that shoe and the coca leaves.

654
00:37:18.930 --> 00:37:23.220
Exactly.
Instead the cocaine and possibly the nicotine to,

655
00:37:23.221 --> 00:37:27.210
we're actually being introduced to the mummies as part of an embalming process.

656
00:37:27.410 --> 00:37:29.460
Huh.
That's interesting.
Whoa.

657
00:37:29.970 --> 00:37:34.650
More likely the obtain cocaine from America.
Okay.
I Dunno.
I'd give up.

658
00:37:35.610 --> 00:37:38.520
There's no way that we'll have to read this.
I tried.

659
00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:40.290
It just seems like it's going to take a long time.

660
00:37:40.590 --> 00:37:43.710
Many residents and spices hold on a second.
Worst certainly used this day.

661
00:37:43.711 --> 00:37:47.490
We're aren't entirely sure what they all were rare or exotic materials we'll

662
00:37:47.491 --> 00:37:48.450
almost certainly used.

663
00:37:49.020 --> 00:37:53.400
And it is far less of a stretch to suggest this included imports from the Middle

664
00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:57.330
East and potentially as far afield as India.
Hm.
I Dunno.

665
00:37:58.290 --> 00:38:02.880
I think they,
this,
they're very skeptical about the idea that people from Egypt,

666
00:38:02.881 --> 00:38:06.960
uh,
we're able to travel all the way to the Americas where cocaine was.

667
00:38:06.961 --> 00:38:08.280
But I think,

668
00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:11.940
I think part of the conclusion was that there were some other things that would

669
00:38:11.941 --> 00:38:15.110
make that you test positive for cocaine.
Oh,
it's interesting.

670
00:38:15.140 --> 00:38:17.600
It will sort of like poppy seeds make you test positive for her.

671
00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:21.470
Did you have to go for a drug test for work?
They say don't eat poppy seed Bagel.

672
00:38:21.990 --> 00:38:24.480
Wasn't there like a Seinfeld?
I'm looking at the Wikipedia for it.

673
00:38:24.750 --> 00:38:28.320
It might've been part of a thriving tourist scam and Egypt and the Victorian

674
00:38:28.321 --> 00:38:28.890
area.

675
00:38:28.890 --> 00:38:32.010
So they might have like said it was there and so people would come look and then

676
00:38:32.550 --> 00:38:35.530
you know,
wait a minute,
said what was there to cocaine?

677
00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:39.790
It says since passing this corpses off recently deceased as ancient mommy's was

678
00:38:39.791 --> 00:38:44.140
a thriving tourists scam and Egypt or in Victoria.
Like I could have a,
I'm to,

679
00:38:44.150 --> 00:38:46.600
I'll put it doesn't make sense because the tests were done in after the

680
00:38:46.601 --> 00:38:50.050
experiments.
Even assuming the cocaine was actually found on the mummies.

681
00:38:50.051 --> 00:38:53.020
It's possible this could have been a contamination that occurred after this

682
00:38:53.090 --> 00:38:58.050
governor.
So bunch of coke heads were fondling.
Money's,
yeah,
well they,

683
00:38:58.160 --> 00:39:00.570
it does Mommy's cause they wanted to eat them as I said,
you know,

684
00:39:00.580 --> 00:39:01.391
they ground them up.

685
00:39:01.391 --> 00:39:04.990
And did you use it at all the ancient Egyptian mummies that you started to think

686
00:39:04.991 --> 00:39:08.440
about?
How much was destroyed.
People had to eat it all the time.

687
00:39:08.441 --> 00:39:13.420
This is a fantastic,
um,
uh,
exhibit Carol.
Mark cure all mummy powder.

688
00:39:13.450 --> 00:39:17.050
Wow.
Look at that.
That is nuts.
Mummy extract.

689
00:39:17.051 --> 00:39:19.510
It's a cure all whatever you got.
Yeah.
Fix it.

690
00:39:19.750 --> 00:39:22.300
<v 2>You know,
it's,
you know,
it's a quack remedy when it's a cure all,</v>

691
00:39:22.330 --> 00:39:25.160
we still have clamp remedies,
you know,
take a pill,
lose weight

692
00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:28.790
<v 0>my back and things that are causing people to lose weight.</v>

693
00:39:28.791 --> 00:39:31.860
And those late night infomercials.
Yup.
Take a bunch of pills.
Yeah.

694
00:39:31.980 --> 00:39:36.010
That's your modern day quackery.
There's a fantastic exhibit that's uh,

695
00:39:36.020 --> 00:39:40.520
right now there's an imax exhibit in Los Angeles at one of the museums.

696
00:39:40.521 --> 00:39:45.440
I saw it about a year ago,
but they have a King Tut exhibit.
And then,

697
00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:50.240
um,
on top of that they have this gigantic imax theater,
which is fantastic.

698
00:39:50.540 --> 00:39:52.250
And they show the,

699
00:39:52.550 --> 00:39:57.550
all these different tombs that they had discovered and how they discovered them.

700
00:39:57.551 --> 00:40:00.860
And,
but it makes,
it makes you really,
when they've discovered King Tut's tomb,

701
00:40:01.430 --> 00:40:06.430
we have no idea how many similar tombs there were that were looted over the

702
00:40:08.710 --> 00:40:09.280
years.
Yeah,

703
00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:11.920
<v 2>absolutely.
I mean,
what we have,
you know,
in the museums,</v>

704
00:40:11.921 --> 00:40:16.060
it's just sort of a fraction of what we know and it's still stuff is coming to

705
00:40:16.061 --> 00:40:19.420
light.
It's just incredible.
Yeah.
Um,
but yeah,
they,
they,

706
00:40:19.630 --> 00:40:24.440
the Victorians are responsible for destroying a lot for taking those mummies
and,

707
00:40:24.441 --> 00:40:26.940
and just grounding them off and all kinds of things.
Yeah.

708
00:40:27.820 --> 00:40:32.600
<v 0>What gets me is,
what was the mode like where was the theory?</v>

709
00:40:32.810 --> 00:40:34.340
Like what did the theory come from?

710
00:40:34.341 --> 00:40:36.950
Like when you want to take a mummy and making it a powder,

711
00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:42.110
<v 2>some of it would have been sort of folk Madison influence.
Um,
you know,
there's,</v>

712
00:40:42.111 --> 00:40:46.700
there's this idea of sympathetic magic.
So,
um,
for instance,
if,
uh,
you,

713
00:40:46.701 --> 00:40:50.250
if I stabbed you with a sword,
it's get very violent.
Um,

714
00:40:50.570 --> 00:40:51.950
you could be healed.

715
00:40:51.951 --> 00:40:55.910
If I put this sort of special sympathetic powder on the sword,

716
00:40:56.540 --> 00:41:01.370
it would heal you.
So it was sort of this on healing by distance.

717
00:41:01.460 --> 00:41:04.880
So all kinds of strange ideas existed,
but,

718
00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:08.300
and that's why it's important when you're studying history medicine to really

719
00:41:08.301 --> 00:41:11.960
get into the mindset because it's so wildly different to the way we think.
Right.

720
00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:16.520
Um,
and,
and you know,
actually,
do you know what this is?
I brought this son,

721
00:41:16.610 --> 00:41:17.900
if people are just listening,
it's,

722
00:41:17.930 --> 00:41:22.860
it's a long beat mask and like a burn ban side.
Yeah,
no,

723
00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:25.160
I do not know what that is.
Okay.
So this,

724
00:41:25.161 --> 00:41:26.990
a lot of people think this is a venetian mass.

725
00:41:26.990 --> 00:41:31.810
This is actually particularly on a particular example from Venice.
It is,
um,

726
00:41:31.940 --> 00:41:34.940
what people would have doctors would have worn during the vaneck plague.

727
00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:38.330
So it's called the play doctor mask.
And so,
um,

728
00:41:38.331 --> 00:41:42.920
it was invented in the 17th century,
um,
by a French doctor.

729
00:41:42.921 --> 00:41:46.460
And the idea behind it was so people thought that disease was spread by this

730
00:41:46.461 --> 00:41:49.850
thing called Miasma,
which are like little particles in the air.

731
00:41:49.851 --> 00:41:53.330
They're sort of associated with bad smells.
So if something smells bad,

732
00:41:53.331 --> 00:41:55.430
it's probably not good for you,
is what they thought.

733
00:41:55.760 --> 00:41:58.850
And it kind of makes sense because if like,
you know,
you're in a really,
um,

734
00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:01.730
if you're in a slummy area of the Victorian period,

735
00:42:01.731 --> 00:42:04.250
it's probably has a lot of disease.
It probably doesn't smell good.

736
00:42:04.251 --> 00:42:05.900
So that was sorta the thinking behind it.

737
00:42:06.290 --> 00:42:11.290
So what you would do is you would put sweet smelling herbs into the beak and so

738
00:42:11.541 --> 00:42:14.840
you would be smelling the scent.
It would protect you from those evil miasma.

739
00:42:15.590 --> 00:42:19.700
Yeah.
And you know,
is that a real one?
No,

740
00:42:19.701 --> 00:42:21.140
we don't actually have,
um,

741
00:42:21.320 --> 00:42:24.380
I don't believe there's an example of a real one from the 17th century,

742
00:42:24.381 --> 00:42:27.710
but there's a lot of illustrations of the plate doctor and he would have been

743
00:42:27.711 --> 00:42:31.360
wearing a hat.
He would have been wearing a cape,
um,

744
00:42:31.820 --> 00:42:35.180
leather gloves,
like sort of just protecting himself.
Oh,
there you go.

745
00:42:35.390 --> 00:42:39.490
That's a real one.
Authentic 16th century plague,
Dr Mask preserved and,

746
00:42:39.491 --> 00:42:40.790
and display at the

747
00:42:46.090 --> 00:42:47.330
museum of medical history.

748
00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:50.750
But I questioned that because it was invented in the 17th century.

749
00:42:50.751 --> 00:42:54.320
So if it's real,
it's going to be a little bit later.
Um,

750
00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:58.370
but we don't know how much they were warm because they would have been
expensive.

751
00:42:58.371 --> 00:43:01.160
A lot of doctors weren't very noble,
so the plate broke out.

752
00:43:01.161 --> 00:43:05.450
They got the hell out of there.
Um,
there was sort of a phrase go far and go long,

753
00:43:05.630 --> 00:43:08.060
you know,
get out and don't come back for a while.

754
00:43:08.610 --> 00:43:09.830
It wasn't much they could do for you.

755
00:43:09.831 --> 00:43:14.831
They had a stick as well that they would sort of poke the patient with so they

756
00:43:14.931 --> 00:43:18.110
wouldn't have to touch the patient and kind of have them turn over and they can,

757
00:43:18.350 --> 00:43:22.880
you know,
yes,
you have the plague.
There wasn't much they could do for you.
Um,

758
00:43:22.881 --> 00:43:26.770
we can cure the place.
They did not know what Wa,
what germs were,

759
00:43:27.570 --> 00:43:32.040
what the plague was.
They had sort of a concept of,
of contagion.

760
00:43:32.041 --> 00:43:34.460
So if you broke out with the plague,

761
00:43:34.520 --> 00:43:37.540
they would probably quarantine you in your house.
Um,

762
00:43:37.660 --> 00:43:42.480
and they put a big cross on the door and so people would bring food and um,
you,

763
00:43:42.550 --> 00:43:46.100
you,
um,
you know,
put a basket outside of your window with a rope and you take,

764
00:43:46.310 --> 00:43:49.730
and so they do that until everybody was dead in the house or that the plague and

765
00:43:49.731 --> 00:43:50.240
passed.

766
00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:53.480
And they felt that you were a safe to come out into the general population.

767
00:43:53.481 --> 00:43:57.980
So there was an idea that these things were contagious but not again in the way

768
00:43:57.981 --> 00:44:01.280
that we kind of understand disease diseases being spread today.

769
00:44:01.700 --> 00:44:03.290
So strange that they would,

770
00:44:05.330 --> 00:44:09.840
would not know what was going on.
Like people dying and you'd be like,
what is it?

771
00:44:09.870 --> 00:44:14.030
You would think it was yeah,
it could be God's curse on,
uh,
and,

772
00:44:14.031 --> 00:44:18.430
and people say,
you know,
oh,
the plague mask is so terrifying.
Um,

773
00:44:19.700 --> 00:44:23.930
it's super creepy,
but I always say that it's good luck.

774
00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:28.340
This is why I brought this across.
The Atlantic said Joe Rogan could,

775
00:44:28.341 --> 00:44:32.790
where the plague,
Dr Mask,
how many people would know what that is?

776
00:44:32.791 --> 00:44:36.540
Like if you went,
you know what,
you go into faculty,
they say play Doctor Mask.

777
00:44:36.660 --> 00:44:39.600
Right.
It's funny cause I was just in Venice recently and they were saying that,

778
00:44:39.601 --> 00:44:42.810
you know,
the big carnival,
um,
that they have every year,

779
00:44:42.840 --> 00:44:46.380
it's becoming harder to do because of security reasons.

780
00:44:46.470 --> 00:44:49.860
So you have like a huge population of his city wearing masks and covering their

781
00:44:49.861 --> 00:44:54.060
identities.
They have to cut back,
which kind of sucks cause you know,

782
00:44:54.061 --> 00:44:58.180
that's like the fun of the carnival.
Um,
so now they're,
they're,
um,
uh,

783
00:44:58.440 --> 00:45:01.230
cutting back where you can wear them in public places and things like that.

784
00:45:01.650 --> 00:45:05.660
But um,
world we live in.
Yeah,
it is.
It is.
Unfortunately,
we're a plague mass.

785
00:45:05.661 --> 00:45:08.130
Can't wear a plague mass.
I'm going to bring it back though.

786
00:45:08.131 --> 00:45:10.180
I'm just going to be walking around in downtown La.
Wow.

787
00:45:10.230 --> 00:45:13.080
Would that attached to your face exclusively straps or something?
Yeah,

788
00:45:13.081 --> 00:45:16.380
there would have been straps or I'm in that other example he was showing it

789
00:45:16.381 --> 00:45:17.760
looked like it was sort of a foreign,

790
00:45:18.740 --> 00:45:20.590
<v 0>I mean,
that looks so creepy.</v>

791
00:45:20.930 --> 00:45:25.800
<v 2>It's so creepy.
But death today we have the modern play doctor.
What,</v>

792
00:45:25.801 --> 00:45:29.930
what do you think that would be?
Yeah,
the,
the Hazmat.
Yeah.
Yeah,
exactly.

793
00:45:29.931 --> 00:45:32.300
And so you think about the Hazmat going into hot zones,

794
00:45:32.301 --> 00:45:35.330
that would be pretty scary if you didn't know what was going on.

795
00:45:35.790 --> 00:45:39.920
And certainly sort of ominous,
you know,
when you see the Hazmat.
So it,

796
00:45:40.220 --> 00:45:44.270
it's a weird thing that exists because in a strange kind of way,

797
00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:47.660
probably did protect the play doctor because he was covering himself up,

798
00:45:47.661 --> 00:45:50.060
but it protected him for the wrong reasons.

799
00:45:50.061 --> 00:45:52.190
He still didn't understand how disease was spreading.

800
00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:57.320
<v 0>Are you aware of the theory of alien abduction being a distant memory of</v>

801
00:45:57.901 --> 00:46:01.470
childbirth?
No.
Yeah,
there's a,

802
00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:06.800
there's a theory that is actually being tossed about that these people that have

803
00:46:08.011 --> 00:46:12.210
this ancient,
well,
they have this memory of childbirth,
right?

804
00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:15.630
So all of a sudden you're being born,
there's bright lights above you.

805
00:46:15.810 --> 00:46:20.430
There's a man or a woman who's the surgeon with a mask that covers their face.

806
00:46:20.431 --> 00:46:24.720
So all you see is their eyes and that everything looks bright and it's

807
00:46:24.721 --> 00:46:28.440
terrifying and clinical and you're on this table and everything's cold.

808
00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:33.900
Most of these alien abduction experiences that people recount,

809
00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:36.410
they'd take place in some sort of a,

810
00:46:36.411 --> 00:46:41.411
a medical facility and everything is bright and strange and cold.

811
00:46:42.780 --> 00:46:45.690
And they think that what this is,
is there.

812
00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:50.220
They're saying that we had this idea that children don't have memories,

813
00:46:50.340 --> 00:46:52.860
that babies don't have memories.
And so they're saying,
well,

814
00:46:52.861 --> 00:46:55.560
why wouldn't they have memory?
So it's ridiculous.
Of course they had memories.

815
00:46:55.561 --> 00:46:58.710
They have brains.
They,
they grab your finger,
they looked you in the eye.

816
00:46:58.740 --> 00:47:01.710
They would have a memory of every second that they were born.

817
00:47:01.740 --> 00:47:06.720
And it's probably one of the most profound and disturbing memories because

818
00:47:06.750 --> 00:47:11.550
before that,
everything is incredibly peaceful inside the mother's womb.
You know,

819
00:47:11.551 --> 00:47:13.620
you're just like taken out,
hold out.

820
00:47:13.621 --> 00:47:17.240
And then there's this bright light above you.
You'd never experienced any lights.

821
00:47:17.250 --> 00:47:22.080
Yeah.
So every and your visual perception,
your field of views all distorted,

822
00:47:22.081 --> 00:47:23.850
right.
This is the first time you're using your eyes.

823
00:47:24.300 --> 00:47:26.290
That's why people have the same into

824
00:47:26.290 --> 00:47:28.780
<v 2>this memory.
Yes.
Early memory.
That's interesting.</v>

825
00:47:28.810 --> 00:47:31.600
<v 0>This a theory.
It makes sense to me because of you.</v>

826
00:47:31.840 --> 00:47:34.380
<v 2>Well,
it's more sense then the abduction.
Yeah.</v>

827
00:47:34.750 --> 00:47:38.030
<v 0>So well does,
because people don't really go anywhere.
See,</v>

828
00:47:38.031 --> 00:47:41.960
the thing about the abduction thing is they've put like cameras in people's

829
00:47:41.961 --> 00:47:46.310
rooms and a,
and they say they have these alien abduction experiences,

830
00:47:46.370 --> 00:47:47.360
but they don't go anywhere.

831
00:47:47.660 --> 00:47:50.570
So what they're doing is they're dreaming and which is

832
00:47:50.700 --> 00:47:55.620
<v 2>the mind is amazing and it's so powerful and we know so little still.</v>

833
00:47:55.621 --> 00:47:56.454
Yeah.

834
00:47:56.830 --> 00:47:58.740
<v 0>So like these all these,
I mean it's,</v>

835
00:47:58.741 --> 00:48:02.530
it's kind of Duh because they all happened while you're sleeping.
Yeah.

836
00:48:02.720 --> 00:48:06.180
90 plus percent.
They tend to be medical.
Yeah.

837
00:48:06.660 --> 00:48:10.020
It's very medical in nature,
right.
You're being examined.

838
00:48:10.021 --> 00:48:13.140
And then there's also going back to childbirth.

839
00:48:13.440 --> 00:48:17.970
There's also a lot of people that have these experiences that they are being

840
00:48:17.971 --> 00:48:22.971
told that either they're taking their baby away from them or they're studying

841
00:48:23.791 --> 00:48:27.480
their baby or that they had a baby inside of them that they know about and that

842
00:48:27.481 --> 00:48:32.040
the aliens have put it there and they're taking it out.
Right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean,

843
00:48:32.041 --> 00:48:34.900
it even goes back to the virgin birth,
right?
I mean,
it's all,
yeah,

844
00:48:34.950 --> 00:48:37.500
it's all very weird.
But this,
uh,

845
00:48:37.650 --> 00:48:42.390
this memory that people have from childhood is a most likely,

846
00:48:42.870 --> 00:48:45.930
uh,
you know,
probably a pretty intense,

847
00:48:46.530 --> 00:48:48.750
powerful interests memory that's always there.

848
00:48:49.010 --> 00:48:50.780
<v 2>Yeah.
And if your first memory yeah.</v>

849
00:48:50.810 --> 00:48:54.640
And some people can tap into it and some people can't.
Yeah,
sure.
Yeah.
Yeah.

850
00:48:54.820 --> 00:48:56.080
<v 0>This is what,
it's also a theory,</v>

851
00:48:56.081 --> 00:48:58.930
while natural childbirth is supposed to be less traumatic,

852
00:48:59.350 --> 00:49:02.560
like women having natural child birth in a bathtub,
you know,

853
00:49:02.950 --> 00:49:04.200
that that is actually kind of

854
00:49:04.200 --> 00:49:05.990
<v 2>like moving back to,
you know,
it's um,</v>

855
00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:10.530
men start to get involved in child birth around the 17th century,
18th century,

856
00:49:10.740 --> 00:49:13.020
what I'm before it was mostly women.

857
00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:16.760
So women in the village would come and actually the term,
um,

858
00:49:16.860 --> 00:49:20.820
gossip comes from the idea of the women who would spread the word in the village

859
00:49:20.821 --> 00:49:23.370
that someone was going into labor,
they were called the gossips.

860
00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:28.170
So they spread the word sort of a negative thing later so that the gossips would

861
00:49:28.171 --> 00:49:29.550
spread the word.
The women would come in.

862
00:49:29.820 --> 00:49:34.140
This was a female only chamber on and men were not really allowed in.

863
00:49:34.470 --> 00:49:39.360
A man might be brought in if the mother was dying or if the child was dying.

864
00:49:39.720 --> 00:49:42.960
And then in that case,
instruments were brought into the birth,

865
00:49:42.990 --> 00:49:47.480
the birth in chambers.
So the doctor might come in and he might,
um,

866
00:49:47.610 --> 00:49:52.130
take these sort of forceps and pick the baby apart and take the baby out and the

867
00:49:52.140 --> 00:49:55.440
baby would die.
But in those cases,
it was like really extreme.

868
00:49:55.441 --> 00:49:57.570
Like this was gonna happen.
Like either the mother was going to die,

869
00:49:57.571 --> 00:49:58.404
the baby was going to die,

870
00:49:58.410 --> 00:50:01.730
both from we're going to die or if the baby was coming out feet first.
Yeah.

871
00:50:02.310 --> 00:50:06.890
Midwife capable midwife could,
could handle that on.
But this,
you know,

872
00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:08.730
this is Syrian section.

873
00:50:08.731 --> 00:50:13.620
People think that it comes from the term that the idea that Julie Caesar was

874
00:50:13.621 --> 00:50:15.480
ripped from the womb of his mother.
Right.

875
00:50:15.540 --> 00:50:20.070
But it's unlikely that that story is true because his mother lives into old age.

876
00:50:20.670 --> 00:50:24.570
So probably the,
the terms of Syrian comes from the Latin term meaning to cut.

877
00:50:25.230 --> 00:50:28.190
And the first sort of a record

878
00:50:28.190 --> 00:50:32.810
<v 3>we have of this happening I think is in the 16th century and it's a farmer and</v>

879
00:50:32.811 --> 00:50:36.950
he takes the instruments that he uses to castrate as pigs to cut this baby out

880
00:50:36.951 --> 00:50:39.760
of his wife.
Um,
yeah.
And,

881
00:50:39.761 --> 00:50:43.580
and we don't have any records of whether this is probably didn't work again,

882
00:50:43.581 --> 00:50:48.530
no idea of germs,
all this kind of stuff.
Um,
but yeah,
I don't have,

883
00:50:48.710 --> 00:50:50.900
there's no sort of,
it doesn't follow the records.

884
00:50:50.901 --> 00:50:54.980
Don't follow the story but she probably died and the baby probably died as well.

885
00:50:59.240 --> 00:51:03.210
Oftentimes castrate them and then let them loose because then they suck.

886
00:51:03.240 --> 00:51:07.730
They concentrate on grass and not ass.
That is a actual farmers term.

887
00:51:07.880 --> 00:51:09.110
I have,
you know,

888
00:51:09.380 --> 00:51:13.040
talking about the Syrian sections and castrating pigs who knew those two things

889
00:51:13.170 --> 00:51:16.530
when
the joint as cautious

890
00:51:18.300 --> 00:51:22.910
as a steers castrated castrate them because they make better stakes.

891
00:51:23.840 --> 00:51:28.290
Things I learned on don't muscular jacked bowl.
No,

892
00:51:28.910 --> 00:51:30.510
probably not being very chewy and

893
00:51:32.290 --> 00:51:37.290
the buffalo above my friend Adam Green tree shot that in Australia and the,

894
00:51:38.600 --> 00:51:43.600
my friend Cam was chewing on a piece of his for one piece for half an hour.

895
00:51:44.570 --> 00:51:48.030
Oh my gosh.
It was bad.
I guess that makes sense.

896
00:51:48.080 --> 00:51:51.720
2000 pound sack of steel is not good.

897
00:51:52.450 --> 00:51:57.020
Then you want to sit down and have a meal?
No,
I mean,
they say they very,

898
00:51:57.021 --> 00:52:01.220
like sometimes some of them you can eat.
I mean,
you can eat them.

899
00:52:01.250 --> 00:52:05.630
They're all buffalo,
but they're just insanely dense.

900
00:52:05.631 --> 00:52:08.540
Crazy.
How big,
I mean,
when you see the skull,

901
00:52:08.541 --> 00:52:12.250
it's just the size of it is incredible.
It's a,

902
00:52:12.530 --> 00:52:15.560
it's also an invasive species,
so they have no natural predators.

903
00:52:15.561 --> 00:52:18.740
There's just thousands and thousands of,
I'm destroying the countryside.

904
00:52:19.520 --> 00:52:23.890
People travel up to the northern lands,
Art Island,

905
00:52:23.900 --> 00:52:27.180
I forget the name of the place where they go and they hunt these things.
Wow.

906
00:52:27.260 --> 00:52:30.770
Yeah,
they're huge.
They are.
Australia is a trip.
I mean,

907
00:52:30.771 --> 00:52:35.450
it wasn't really a wildlife experiment brought in so many animals and New

908
00:52:35.450 --> 00:52:39.270
Zealand as well.
And they're not indigenous and they're just doing a lot.
Um,

909
00:52:39.330 --> 00:52:44.330
so when you think about the history of surgery and that you,

910
00:52:44.601 --> 00:52:49.310
you concentrate on this one very particular time in this book,

911
00:52:49.490 --> 00:52:53.660
in this book,
but as a medical historian,
like when,
what,
first of all,

912
00:52:53.661 --> 00:52:58.010
what led you to that?
Like why you seem so normal thing?
Oh yeah.
I'm super normal.

913
00:52:58.011 --> 00:53:01.790
Look at all these skulls and stuff in front of me.
Um,
I,
you know,

914
00:53:01.791 --> 00:53:04.940
I'm like that kid who never grew out of the obsession with tales from the crypt,

915
00:53:06.200 --> 00:53:09.770
Ripley's believe it or not,
you know,
the shrunken heads.
I actually did a

916
00:53:11.280 --> 00:53:14.540
segment for documentary in the shrunken heads and I had to go out to Poland.

917
00:53:14.541 --> 00:53:17.960
I actually got to hold these things that I was always fascinated with growing up

918
00:53:18.080 --> 00:53:20.780
where people don't know that they think the skulls in there.

919
00:53:21.080 --> 00:53:24.110
That's why they don't understand what's happening to shrink your head.
And it's,

920
00:53:24.111 --> 00:53:25.980
it's amazing because I'm,
what they do

921
00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:29.850
<v 2>is that you obviously like they take the Skoll out and it's a process and this</v>

922
00:53:29.851 --> 00:53:31.680
documentary was looking at,

923
00:53:31.730 --> 00:53:35.760
they were DNA testing them because the tribe that makes these skulls,

924
00:53:35.761 --> 00:53:40.230
they were done for a specific purpose to trap the soul of the warrior that they

925
00:53:40.231 --> 00:53:43.380
killed.
So that there was a spiritual reason behind it.

926
00:53:43.620 --> 00:53:47.720
But what they were finding was that some of these shrunken heads were female.
Um,

927
00:53:47.910 --> 00:53:52.170
which probably means that,
um,
as Westerners came into these areas,

928
00:53:52.171 --> 00:53:55.140
they wanted to collect these shrunken heads is curiosities of course.

929
00:53:55.141 --> 00:53:59.910
And so they traded guns for heads.
And so it kind of drove up the,

930
00:53:59.911 --> 00:54:04.850
uh,
the demand for these,
these shrunken heads.
Well,
it wasn't just it,

931
00:54:05.010 --> 00:54:07.620
just anybody and it might not have been killing them.

932
00:54:07.621 --> 00:54:10.440
It might've just been taking bodies of people who had already died,

933
00:54:10.860 --> 00:54:14.800
but they definitely aren't all authentic in the sense that they were,
um,

934
00:54:15.540 --> 00:54:17.580
killed in battle.
And so it's just kind of an interesting,

935
00:54:17.581 --> 00:54:20.820
but I got to interact and see the shrunken heads.
So I was that weird,

936
00:54:20.821 --> 00:54:24.330
creepy kid that,
you know,
no one really wanted to talk to.
I joke that I was,

937
00:54:24.331 --> 00:54:27.480
I also,
um,
looked like Barb from stranger things

938
00:54:29.400 --> 00:54:32.250
and my brother pointed this out and we were watching stranger things and then

939
00:54:32.280 --> 00:54:37.050
Barb dies and nobody gives a shit.
And I'm like,
yes,
sorry.

940
00:54:37.290 --> 00:54:41.400
Sorry everybody.
Um,
and I was just devastated.
I'm like,
nobody noticed for,

941
00:54:41.401 --> 00:54:44.900
you know,
like the whole season,
but they barely carrier.

942
00:54:44.901 --> 00:54:49.710
I guess she's missing that.
No one cared about bars by the pool.
I was,

943
00:54:49.711 --> 00:54:52.770
I was really awkward.
I was five,
seven by the age of 10.
And I was just,

944
00:54:52.771 --> 00:54:56.750
I was just like that weird kid with tales from the crypt.
And so I kind of it.

945
00:54:56.751 --> 00:55:00.660
So I went on to study history in college and then I went to Oxford and I did a

946
00:55:00.661 --> 00:55:05.310
masters and phd in it.
But academia is not,
it's isn't,

947
00:55:05.500 --> 00:55:08.310
doesn't allow me to be as creative and weird as I'd like to be.

948
00:55:08.730 --> 00:55:10.410
So now I'm just a storyteller.

949
00:55:10.411 --> 00:55:14.200
I'm a freelance writer and I do this youtube channel and I'm sure Oxford's going

950
00:55:14.201 --> 00:55:18.090
to be like,
give us the peach phd back.
Can they do that?
No,

951
00:55:18.990 --> 00:55:22.320
there's a real value in that in terms of education because what you do is very

952
00:55:22.321 --> 00:55:27.140
interesting and entertaining.
I mean that's
tweeting your stuff.
It's really,
no,

953
00:55:27.150 --> 00:55:27.990
I appreciate that.
You know,

954
00:55:27.991 --> 00:55:31.920
it's funny because there is this sort of tension between what they call popular

955
00:55:31.921 --> 00:55:36.240
history and academic history and I will get like academic historians will come

956
00:55:36.241 --> 00:55:38.400
at me on Twitter and stuff and this one guy said to me,

957
00:55:38.580 --> 00:55:41.790
well you're just an entertainer.
And I was like,
well that's not an insult to me.

958
00:55:41.791 --> 00:55:46.330
Like that's why is that?
And it's true.
You have a phd,
like yeah,

959
00:55:46.350 --> 00:55:49.010
it's stupid.
I should've just said that.
You know,

960
00:55:49.850 --> 00:55:52.680
you're just an entertainer.
Yeah.
Just it's like,

961
00:55:52.710 --> 00:55:56.480
it's like a bastardizing the subject and some kind of way that they don't like

962
00:55:56.481 --> 00:56:01.050
it.
It's because of people like me,
I'm like,
Hey,
oh gross.
I retweet it.
I know.

963
00:56:01.051 --> 00:56:04.980
Exactly.
And then it makes it,
and then they want it,
you know,

964
00:56:04.981 --> 00:56:08.430
like I did this thread on Twitter called your Victorian doctors trying to kill

965
00:56:08.431 --> 00:56:13.110
you.
And every tweet was like coke or rats,
cocaine laced cigarettes,

966
00:56:13.111 --> 00:56:16.500
which you had also shared at one point and just all the kinds of crazy things.

967
00:56:16.501 --> 00:56:18.060
And then at the end of the threat,
I said,

968
00:56:18.240 --> 00:56:21.390
but what is it about today that people will,
will look back?
But you know,

969
00:56:21.391 --> 00:56:25.560
this one academic was like,
this is,
um,
you know,
bad history and you're,

970
00:56:25.600 --> 00:56:28.930
you're making it fun.
How dare you,
you know,
it's like that scene to vote.
Yeah.

971
00:56:28.931 --> 00:56:33.100
Offense of that.
But for the most part,
people enjoy it and,
and that's nice.

972
00:56:34.420 --> 00:56:39.220
The big complaint that people have about academia is that it's so stuffy.
Yeah.

973
00:56:40.240 --> 00:56:43.300
I'm going to get like so many weird academic Trump.
I know,
it's just,

974
00:56:43.330 --> 00:56:46.030
it's one of those things like I've had to make peace with,
um,

975
00:56:46.390 --> 00:56:48.940
because I am a storyteller and if you look at my profile,

976
00:56:48.941 --> 00:56:53.290
I call myself a storyteller first rather than historian stories.

977
00:56:53.540 --> 00:56:58.540
Three stories for us in 2019 are so incredibly fortunate to have actual real

978
00:56:59.861 --> 00:57:04.680
doctors with real modern medicine to fix us.
Real tore down shows,

979
00:57:04.690 --> 00:57:07.000
had probably five surgeries.

980
00:57:09.310 --> 00:57:12.220
I know I had an appendectomy and it was,
it was amazing.

981
00:57:12.221 --> 00:57:15.920
They use little tiny robotic instruments now and they,
they barely make,
you know,

982
00:57:16.090 --> 00:57:19.030
I think the incisions like an inch long or something.

983
00:57:19.040 --> 00:57:21.890
It's just had shoulder surgery and the,
the,

984
00:57:21.970 --> 00:57:26.950
the actual cuts are like millimeters,
tiny little cuts.

985
00:57:27.250 --> 00:57:31.570
You barely can see the scars.
It's amazing.
And you know,

986
00:57:31.720 --> 00:57:36.010
with your knee surgery it was a,
an injury from activity.
Right.

987
00:57:36.580 --> 00:57:40.210
You know,
and you think about people in the past,
they weren't necessary.
Well,

988
00:57:40.240 --> 00:57:42.700
I mean there were,
there were sports and in competitions,

989
00:57:42.701 --> 00:57:45.070
but mostly people were getting injuries from repetitive,

990
00:57:45.430 --> 00:57:50.110
strenuous Labor that they were doing.
Um,
there's a story of a,

991
00:57:50.111 --> 00:57:55.111
of a cab driver in the 18th century and he got this aneurism behind his knees.

992
00:57:56.531 --> 00:57:57.490
So,
um,

993
00:57:57.491 --> 00:58:00.850
the cab drivers in the 18th century where these high boots like riding boots and

994
00:58:00.851 --> 00:58:04.270
it would rub at the back of the knee and it created this huge aneurysm.

995
00:58:05.410 --> 00:58:08.980
And there was a surgeon named John Hunter in London who said,
well,

996
00:58:08.981 --> 00:58:12.970
normally what you do is you would hack the leg off because if it pops right,

997
00:58:13.260 --> 00:58:16.210
given pops are going to bleed out.
But he said,
I have an idea.

998
00:58:16.600 --> 00:58:20.920
I want to cut into the lag and I want to tie off the blood supply to the

999
00:58:20.921 --> 00:58:24.280
aneurysm.
I want to see if that works.
And it did.
And he saved this guy's leg.

1000
00:58:24.760 --> 00:58:29.080
And that's really important because remember these people had no options if they

1001
00:58:29.081 --> 00:58:30.320
couldn't work.
A lot of these

1002
00:58:32.920 --> 00:58:37.600
people think of aneurysm and think of a brain,
right?
It's like a,
um,
what's the,

1003
00:58:37.630 --> 00:58:41.140
what's the term?
It's um,
it's a specific kind of aneurysm.

1004
00:58:41.141 --> 00:58:45.190
It's almost like a balloon that appears on the outs,

1005
00:58:45.340 --> 00:58:49.540
sort of on the outside of that blood.
Big Sack of blood.
Just drain it.

1006
00:58:49.850 --> 00:58:54.220
That's what I would think
if you severed it.
Yeah.

1007
00:58:54.221 --> 00:58:58.810
I don't know.
Um,
I'd be like slow down doc.
Yeah.
Don't,

1008
00:58:58.900 --> 00:59:03.520
don't hack that leg drive this taxi bitch.
Yeah.
And if he had lost his leg,

1009
00:59:03.521 --> 00:59:06.640
it would have been.
And what's incredible about that story actually is that he,

1010
00:59:06.700 --> 00:59:11.470
that hunter saves the leg and then when the man dies,
right before he dies,

1011
00:59:11.471 --> 00:59:13.660
he knows he's going to die.
This is many years later,

1012
00:59:13.870 --> 00:59:17.050
he writes a letter and he wills his body to hunter.

1013
00:59:17.051 --> 00:59:20.060
So this is one of the first early examples,
uh,
to,

1014
00:59:20.061 --> 00:59:23.330
to take the lag and to open it up and dissect it and to see what happened.

1015
00:59:23.331 --> 00:59:27.530
And so that way it's on display at the surgeons.
Uh,
I'm sorry,

1016
00:59:27.531 --> 00:59:30.820
at the Royal College of Surgeons in London.
So they embalmed it a,
yeah.

1017
00:59:30.890 --> 00:59:34.190
Well he would have preserved it probably with on wax injections.

1018
00:59:34.220 --> 00:59:38.810
Almost like plastination,
like an early form.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1019
00:59:38.960 --> 00:59:41.180
That weird guy.
Um,
body worlds

1020
00:59:43.870 --> 00:59:47.710
<v 0>very torn.
When I was walking around this because what a part of me was saying,</v>

1021
00:59:47.711 --> 00:59:50.320
this is really fascinating.
And the other part of you is saying,

1022
00:59:50.321 --> 00:59:54.400
what is the difference between this and like fucking Ed gains house where he

1023
00:59:54.401 --> 00:59:55.770
made lampshades out of it?

1024
00:59:56.030 --> 00:59:59.600
<v 2>Well,
yeah,
I mean one would hope that the difference is consent,</v>

1025
01:00:00.290 --> 01:00:02.880
but I would hope though,
yeah,
one would hope,

1026
01:00:02.930 --> 01:00:07.370
well there has been controversies with certain acts,
exhibitions,

1027
01:00:07.490 --> 01:00:08.510
maybe not body worlds,

1028
01:00:08.511 --> 01:00:11.600
but there's been some spinoffs where there's been a question of where they got

1029
01:00:11.601 --> 01:00:13.400
those bodies.
And of course if,

1030
01:00:13.460 --> 01:00:17.030
if you're also going into sort of poor areas and asking people to hand over

1031
01:00:17.031 --> 01:00:18.740
their bodies,
is it really consent?

1032
01:00:18.741 --> 01:00:22.280
Because sometimes these families don't have money for funerals and there's other

1033
01:00:22.281 --> 01:00:27.260
incentives.
But I think my view is why,
you know,
it's,

1034
01:00:27.261 --> 01:00:31.700
it's given under the guise of science that we can only view dead bodies through

1035
01:00:31.910 --> 01:00:36.440
the lens of Science Day.
That's the only acceptable way.
But it really is art.
Um,

1036
01:00:36.530 --> 01:00:41.360
and I wished that it would just be more openly recognize is just art,

1037
01:00:41.361 --> 01:00:43.310
whether it's you're kind of thing or not,

1038
01:00:43.311 --> 01:00:48.311
because some of it is posed and really shocking ways that are unnecessary to

1039
01:00:48.591 --> 01:00:51.410
teach anatomy.
So,
so,
you know,

1040
01:00:51.411 --> 01:00:54.080
if you're going to say it's an anatomical lesson,

1041
01:00:55.010 --> 01:00:58.070
why does the person have to be posed in this sort of dramatic way?

1042
01:00:58.071 --> 01:00:59.600
So I think that,
you know,

1043
01:00:59.601 --> 01:01:01.820
it would be better if we just called it for what it was.

1044
01:01:01.821 --> 01:01:04.430
It's art and it's supposed to be provocative and shocking.

1045
01:01:04.820 --> 01:01:08.440
And that's why people come to see it and were morbidly curious is absolutely

1046
01:01:08.450 --> 01:01:12.230
interesting.
Yeah.
I mean,
and,
and people say,
oh my gosh,
uh,

1047
01:01:12.231 --> 01:01:14.540
the Victorians bought tickets,
the operating theater.
Well,

1048
01:01:14.660 --> 01:01:16.850
people come to my Instagram account,
you know,
I mean,

1049
01:01:16.851 --> 01:01:18.370
we're still morbidly curious.

1050
01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:22.290
<v 0>Oh,
for sure.
It's really interesting that it's called a theater as well.</v>

1051
01:01:22.630 --> 01:01:25.620
Did you ever see that movie with Benito Del Toro?

1052
01:01:26.490 --> 01:01:30.600
I think it was just the wolf man.
It was one of the more recent werewolf movies,

1053
01:01:30.840 --> 01:01:33.900
but he becomes a werewolf in the operating theater.

1054
01:01:34.290 --> 01:01:36.300
<v 2>Oh.
The doctor's convinced.</v>

1055
01:01:36.770 --> 01:01:40.490
<v 0>The doctor's convinced that he's a mad man,
there's something wrong with him.</v>

1056
01:01:40.491 --> 01:01:42.800
So they'd give him electric shock therapy.

1057
01:01:43.020 --> 01:01:44.040
<v 2>It's different things.</v>

1058
01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:49.020
And what's the period that it's supposed to be in this period?
Oh yeah,
yeah,

1059
01:01:49.070 --> 01:01:53.640
yeah.
It's in London.
So yeah,
see me can find it.
It's kind of a crazy scene.

1060
01:01:53.950 --> 01:01:58.950
The doctors were experimenting with electricity a lot and galvanism and things

1061
01:01:59.131 --> 01:02:00.870
like kind of reanimating the corpses.

1062
01:02:01.270 --> 01:02:06.270
We'd get the story Frankenstein and they were also interested in how long do you

1063
01:02:07.381 --> 01:02:12.090
live or your conscience after,
um,
you're beheaded.
So there's these experiments,

1064
01:02:12.091 --> 01:02:14.850
these experiments during the French revolution where they're like shouting at

1065
01:02:14.851 --> 01:02:18.040
the heads to see if the heads will blink.
Um,
so

1066
01:02:18.040 --> 01:02:22.020
<v 0>I'm sure we can't,
uh,
air this on youtube.
So this will only be us watching this.</v>

1067
01:02:22.021 --> 01:02:24.720
Cause if we air it on youtube,
they'll don't do a,
see,

1068
01:02:24.721 --> 01:02:27.370
that's exactly what this theater's,
yeah.

1069
01:02:27.390 --> 01:02:30.290
He's like saying that he's going to kill all of them.
Like you,

1070
01:02:30.300 --> 01:02:32.700
you need to get outta here.
And they,

1071
01:02:33.390 --> 01:02:33.540
<v 4>okay,</v>

1072
01:02:33.540 --> 01:02:38.540
<v 0>this doctor is a very arrogant and they're dealing with him and the moon turns</v>

1073
01:02:39.451 --> 01:02:42.020
full and he starts freaking out.
And it's,

1074
01:02:42.030 --> 01:02:45.640
it's really interesting because if this was actually how they had patient

1075
01:02:45.641 --> 01:02:48.040
strapped in,
is that accurate?
Like the way that

1076
01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:51.430
<v 2>chair is set up,
they would have the,
I mean,
so his feet,</v>

1077
01:02:51.431 --> 01:02:54.310
it looked like his feet were on the ground so the chair would have been higher.

1078
01:02:54.311 --> 01:02:55.960
So it's feet would have sort of dangled.

1079
01:02:56.160 --> 01:02:59.480
<v 0>That's one of the best ever.
And I'm a giant Werewolf Fan.</v>

1080
01:02:59.810 --> 01:03:03.890
This is one of the best ever,
because this was actually done by Rick Baker,

1081
01:03:03.891 --> 01:03:05.870
who is the same guy who did an American Werewolf in London,

1082
01:03:05.871 --> 01:03:07.490
which is the Werewolf.
It's out in the hall.

1083
01:03:07.560 --> 01:03:10.080
<v 2>Okay.
Oh yeah.
I took pictures of that.
Yeah,
everyone does.</v>

1084
01:03:11.550 --> 01:03:16.170
<v 0>But this is the modern version of it that they decided to make.
And you know,</v>

1085
01:03:16.171 --> 01:03:19.170
the thing is that these guys are watching this and the doctors arrogant,

1086
01:03:19.171 --> 01:03:21.300
he has his back to the patient while he's discussing

1087
01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:24.700
<v 2>and it does exactly what those peers would have looked like as well.
Yeah.</v>

1088
01:03:25.320 --> 01:03:29.580
But they would have been just so crowded.
That is so strange though,

1089
01:03:29.581 --> 01:03:32.670
that this was like,
this was entertainment.

1090
01:03:32.671 --> 01:03:35.100
This was something that people wanted to say.
Well,
you know,

1091
01:03:35.101 --> 01:03:37.110
it wasn't just sort of the morbid curiosity.

1092
01:03:37.111 --> 01:03:40.110
It was also that the Victorians were obsessed with,
uh,
uh,

1093
01:03:40.340 --> 01:03:43.680
sigh scientific progress.
So they wanted to come in and see,
right.

1094
01:03:43.950 --> 01:03:47.700
I see that they want to see what there is to work of there now in the training

1095
01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:49.220
for people are listening.

1096
01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:53.920
<v 0>Yeah.
This is,
it's not a good movie,
but it's a,</v>

1097
01:03:54.840 --> 01:03:55.890
it's a great scene.

1098
01:03:56.630 --> 01:03:59.760
There's a bunch of great scenes in this movie I enjoy just because I love

1099
01:04:00.060 --> 01:04:01.680
Werewolf movies.
Yeah,
yeah,

1100
01:04:03.620 --> 01:04:04.430
<v 4>yeah.</v>

1101
01:04:04.430 --> 01:04:05.600
<v 2>It would have been fun to shoot.</v>

1102
01:04:06.990 --> 01:04:09.570
<v 0>Yeah.
Well,
it's,
um,
it's also,</v>

1103
01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:14.600
they decided in this movie to make it with minimal use of CGI and yeah.

1104
01:04:15.960 --> 01:04:20.610
What they decided to do was do it all with actuals.
Yeah.

1105
01:04:21.270 --> 01:04:25.730
Rubber masks and things like that.
Yeah.
Pretty ridiculous movie.
Or,
honestly,

1106
01:04:26.430 --> 01:04:30.300
<v 2>it actually,
it's funny because,
um,
it sort of reminds me of,
of again,</v>

1107
01:04:30.301 --> 01:04:32.280
listing the six two giant,

1108
01:04:32.281 --> 01:04:36.060
he got a patient on the table who had to have a bladder stone removed.

1109
01:04:36.061 --> 01:04:39.480
Remember how awful that was?
And this guy was like,
fuck it,

1110
01:04:39.481 --> 01:04:42.540
I'm not going to do it.
He jumps off the table,
he runs across the room,

1111
01:04:42.541 --> 01:04:46.170
locks himself in a closet and list Liston,
all six,

1112
01:04:46.171 --> 01:04:49.920
two of them chases this guy,
ripped the door off and just drags him back.

1113
01:04:50.130 --> 01:04:53.910
Oh my God.
So,
you know,
and that really happens again,
be a great movie.

1114
01:04:53.911 --> 01:04:56.190
Anybody listening?
Yeah.
Really pushing this movie.

1115
01:04:56.690 --> 01:04:59.760
Are you trying to sell that while you're out here?
No.
I mean,

1116
01:04:59.780 --> 01:05:04.320
I'm a guarantee you someone is listening.
I,
I,
you know,

1117
01:05:04.380 --> 01:05:05.640
I could sell the rights to the book,

1118
01:05:05.641 --> 01:05:08.760
but I've held onto him when I'm developing them with my producing partner

1119
01:05:08.761 --> 01:05:12.270
because this book was born out of a lot of traumas.

1120
01:05:12.270 --> 01:05:16.020
So a couple of years ago I went through a really bad divorce and I was facing

1121
01:05:16.021 --> 01:05:20.830
deportation as a from the UK.
And so I had no money.
I,
they took my passport,

1122
01:05:20.860 --> 01:05:23.830
everything,
like I couldn't do anything.
So I wrote this book.

1123
01:05:24.100 --> 01:05:26.590
And so I always say that Joseph lister saved a lot of lives,

1124
01:05:26.591 --> 01:05:30.460
not least my own because it's kind of lifted me and it's been a rebirth.
Um,

1125
01:05:30.461 --> 01:05:32.440
so I really want to be involved in the process.

1126
01:05:32.441 --> 01:05:34.180
I've always been fascinated with movies.

1127
01:05:34.181 --> 01:05:36.580
I want to kind of see how the sausage is made so to speak.
You know,

1128
01:05:36.581 --> 01:05:38.410
if you're a writer and you just sell off the rights,
you're not,

1129
01:05:38.680 --> 01:05:43.180
you don't really have much creative input at all.
Um,
but yeah,

1130
01:05:43.181 --> 01:05:46.480
I just think that,
you know,
it's,
it's a great story because it's,

1131
01:05:46.481 --> 01:05:50.110
it sort of crosses with the,
with people who are interested in the horror genre,

1132
01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:52.930
right?
Cause you get the surgery,
the Victorian surgery,

1133
01:05:52.931 --> 01:05:56.260
but it's an uplifting story about something that changed the world and the way

1134
01:05:56.261 --> 01:05:57.670
we fundamentally understand it.

1135
01:05:57.830 --> 01:06:02.180
<v 3>Who you envisioned playing lister?
I see Bradley Cooper.
Oh,</v>

1136
01:06:05.730 --> 01:06:10.490
Jamie's like perfect.
Trying to think of someone else,
but yeah,
that's basically,

1137
01:06:10.491 --> 01:06:14.450
do every move here.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He's like a quintessential movie star,
right?

1138
01:06:14.451 --> 01:06:16.140
Is He is,
yeah.
I was thinking

1139
01:06:16.830 --> 01:06:20.610
<v 2>Eddie Redmayne,
the British actor who's like,
he's so sweet,</v>

1140
01:06:20.611 --> 01:06:25.611
and lister is a very sort of who's cycle he's in on fantastic beasts and where

1141
01:06:25.621 --> 01:06:27.670
to find them.
The Harry Potter,
he's,
he's a,

1142
01:06:27.671 --> 01:06:30.610
he's really big in Britain or benedict Cumberbatch.

1143
01:06:30.780 --> 01:06:33.090
<v 3>Oh,
that guy's awesome.
Yeah,
but it extraction.</v>

1144
01:06:33.300 --> 01:06:36.900
I think benedict Cumberbatch would like to play listing the six to guide because

1145
01:06:36.901 --> 01:06:38.750
it's,
it's a real theatrical role.

1146
01:06:39.960 --> 01:06:42.480
He's another guy who was awesome and everything.
Amazing.
Yeah.

1147
01:06:42.930 --> 01:06:46.260
So if you're listening Benedek he's killer in doc.

1148
01:06:46.261 --> 01:06:48.840
Dr Strange is another movie that's not the best movie in the world,

1149
01:06:48.841 --> 01:06:53.120
but he's killer in it and he's tall.
You know,
he could play listing,
you know,

1150
01:06:53.430 --> 01:06:56.640
we could bulk them out of bed and,
Aha.
There we go.

1151
01:06:58.020 --> 01:07:00.690
Would you like a role in this as maybe the patient and

1152
01:07:02.420 --> 01:07:06.240
the Guy Jumps off his dick?
Hannah,

1153
01:07:08.670 --> 01:07:12.300
you don't want to be the guy that dies when his coat is slashed.
Yikes.
Yeah.

1154
01:07:12.301 --> 01:07:16.580
I'll be that guy.
Be The guy with faith.
Ooh,
Gosh.

1155
01:07:18.570 --> 01:07:19.660
Yeah.
That's a good role.

1156
01:07:21.510 --> 01:07:23.610
So this book sort of,

1157
01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:28.110
you were in quite a bit of personal anguish yourself.

1158
01:07:29.700 --> 01:07:32.570
You have this deep attachment to it.
I can understand that.

1159
01:07:32.580 --> 01:07:36.330
It's my first book and I'm working on a new book on the history of plastic

1160
01:07:36.331 --> 01:07:39.480
surgery and fascinated with that as well.

1161
01:07:40.190 --> 01:07:41.090
<v 2>It's interest.
So I'm,</v>

1162
01:07:41.150 --> 01:07:44.810
I'm looking at a guy named Harold Gillies who was rebuilding soldiers faces

1163
01:07:44.811 --> 01:07:49.160
during World War One.
And if you've ever seen these guys photos,
I mean it's,

1164
01:07:49.640 --> 01:07:51.350
we have no problems.
You know,
you,

1165
01:07:51.351 --> 01:07:54.680
you think we have no problems in the 21st century when you look at these guys

1166
01:07:54.681 --> 01:07:57.290
because they've been shot through the face and the jaws are missing.

1167
01:07:57.680 --> 01:08:02.680
And Harold Gillies on really designs or starts plastic surgery as we know it.

1168
01:08:04.250 --> 01:08:07.610
And it was a time when losing a limb made you a hero but losing your face made

1169
01:08:07.611 --> 01:08:08.211
you a monster.

1170
01:08:08.211 --> 01:08:11.540
So these guys are really isolated and so what Gillies does is he gives them

1171
01:08:11.541 --> 01:08:12.500
their identity back.

1172
01:08:12.950 --> 01:08:16.880
So it starts on the battlefields of world one and it's going to kind of follow

1173
01:08:16.881 --> 01:08:19.820
Gillies throughout.
I like to do character driven stories,

1174
01:08:19.821 --> 01:08:20.960
even though there are 100% true.

1175
01:08:20.961 --> 01:08:24.260
I like to sort of follow medical history through the eyes of one particular

1176
01:08:24.261 --> 01:08:25.480
person.
Wow.

1177
01:08:25.810 --> 01:08:26.530
<v 0>Yeah.
The,</v>

1178
01:08:26.530 --> 01:08:30.490
the history of plastic surgery is fascinating to me and I'm hooked on that show.

1179
01:08:30.491 --> 01:08:31.324
Botched.

1180
01:08:31.430 --> 01:08:35.390
<v 2>Oh yeah.
People always mentioned that.
So this is me watching box.</v>

1181
01:08:35.391 --> 01:08:37.900
This is me all the time.
Like,
Jeez,
yeah,

1182
01:08:38.750 --> 01:08:43.090
it's Christ doing,
man.
Stop doing that.
What people put themselves through.

1183
01:08:43.570 --> 01:08:47.230
I started following some plastic surgeons on Instagram just to kind of know
what,

1184
01:08:47.280 --> 01:08:52.070
what they're doing today and thinking about the ethics of how they target people

1185
01:08:52.071 --> 01:08:56.000
on social media and how do we feel about that.
And I'm telling you,

1186
01:08:56.480 --> 01:08:58.820
I'm 37.
I'm feeling bad about my body.

1187
01:08:58.821 --> 01:09:02.060
I can't imagine if you were like 14 and awkward and you're Barb,
you know,

1188
01:09:02.061 --> 01:09:05.510
and you and you and you have access to these accounts and the effect it has on

1189
01:09:05.570 --> 01:09:07.610
young people on Instagram and everything.

1190
01:09:08.050 --> 01:09:11.530
<v 0>I had Jonathan Haidt on the podcast who wrote this book,</v>

1191
01:09:11.531 --> 01:09:13.510
the coddling of the American mind.
And,
uh,

1192
01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:17.800
one of the big things that he discusses his people comparing themselves to

1193
01:09:17.801 --> 01:09:21.340
others through social media and children,
particularly girls,

1194
01:09:21.730 --> 01:09:25.510
this higher instances of suicide,
cutting depression,

1195
01:09:25.540 --> 01:09:29.190
much higher instances of depression,
I believe.
Yeah.
I believe it too.
It's,

1196
01:09:29.191 --> 01:09:29.891
it's crazy.

1197
01:09:29.891 --> 01:09:34.630
And then you see someone like Kylie Jenner who transforms herself literally from

1198
01:09:34.631 --> 01:09:39.631
an Ugly Duckling into a beautiful swan and it's all done through the knife and

1199
01:09:40.031 --> 01:09:41.530
it's,
it's crazy.

1200
01:09:41.640 --> 01:09:45.090
<v 2>That's the whole thing like that,
that kind of beauty is unattainable release.</v>

1201
01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:50.080
Oh yeah.
This is,
this is Harold Gillies,
one of his patients on,

1202
01:09:50.200 --> 01:09:53.490
and why is the end,
yeah.

1203
01:09:53.491 --> 01:09:57.270
And what he did was he invented this thing called the tube pedicle where he

1204
01:09:57.271 --> 01:10:01.860
would take skin and he would basically create a tube and he can place it

1205
01:10:02.100 --> 01:10:05.160
somewhere on the face where the defect was in the blood supply would make it

1206
01:10:05.161 --> 01:10:08.730
attach.
And the guy did an incredible job.
I mean,

1207
01:10:08.731 --> 01:10:12.800
first for 19,
that was probably 1917 right there.

1208
01:10:12.830 --> 01:10:16.830
So that's like better than a lot of the people on box.
It really is.

1209
01:10:17.560 --> 01:10:22.240
Yeah.
The final product.
And that's Gillies down down there that um,

1210
01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:26.010
yeah,
that's another man.
No,
he was incredible.

1211
01:10:26.310 --> 01:10:30.050
And really when you think about what these guys went through to,
um,
so the,

1212
01:10:30.060 --> 01:10:34.110
so my book is starting with this guy named Pearcey Claire who shot for both

1213
01:10:34.111 --> 01:10:36.180
cheeks and his face is just blown off.

1214
01:10:36.180 --> 01:10:40.980
And to get off the battlefield was half the struggle because if your face is

1215
01:10:40.981 --> 01:10:42.960
blown off,
most of the time,
the stretcher bearers,

1216
01:10:42.961 --> 01:10:46.980
we'll just pass you up because they think you're going to die.
Um,

1217
01:10:47.010 --> 01:10:50.520
but it was a survivable wound.
And so just getting off the battlefield,
you know,

1218
01:10:50.521 --> 01:10:54.650
so you sit there for 12 hours,
maybe die in the process food,

1219
01:10:54.660 --> 01:10:56.760
you can't eat no food.
And that was the other thing.

1220
01:10:56.761 --> 01:10:58.950
So a lot of these guys died because well,

1221
01:10:58.980 --> 01:11:02.970
intending nurses would lay them down and if you don't have a jaw,

1222
01:11:02.971 --> 01:11:07.650
your tongue slips back into your throat and you choke or you suffocate.

1223
01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:11.380
Um,
so,
so just getting to Harold Gillies hospital,

1224
01:11:11.381 --> 01:11:14.070
so he starts this incredible facial,
um,

1225
01:11:14.071 --> 01:11:16.750
and jaw unit in Britain during the war.

1226
01:11:16.751 --> 01:11:19.230
Just to get there was a battle.

1227
01:11:19.740 --> 01:11:21.900
And then you have to go through all these painful operations.

1228
01:11:21.900 --> 01:11:24.720
And so I want to look at that.
And then of course,

1229
01:11:24.721 --> 01:11:28.770
like how does that become what we do today?
But equally,

1230
01:11:28.771 --> 01:11:31.950
I always tell people that botched is one form of plastic surgery.

1231
01:11:31.951 --> 01:11:34.770
But of course there's a lot of important surgeons doing reconstructive work.

1232
01:11:34.890 --> 01:11:38.970
Yeah.
You know,
and now we have face transplants,
which are incredible.

1233
01:11:39.150 --> 01:11:41.580
I don't know,
Jamie,
if you could find someone who said a face transplant,

1234
01:11:41.581 --> 01:11:45.000
but there are quite a few.
Yeah.
There's,
there's,
you know,
the,

1235
01:11:45.060 --> 01:11:47.850
I think the hardest part is finding the donor.

1236
01:11:48.300 --> 01:11:51.840
It's hard to get people to donate their organs as it is,
but think about a face.

1237
01:11:51.841 --> 01:11:54.990
It's so personal.
Yeah.
Um,
and the last one,

1238
01:11:54.991 --> 01:11:58.370
national geographic did a spread on it and it was,
um,

1239
01:11:59.610 --> 01:12:04.350
18 I think it was an 18 year old girl who was shot herself in the face and in a

1240
01:12:04.351 --> 01:12:08.070
moment of rage.
And I'm just thinking in,
in any way.

1241
01:12:08.071 --> 01:12:12.010
She ended up having this face transplant about three years later and the,

1242
01:12:12.040 --> 01:12:15.120
the donor face,
I think with someone who is in their thirties,
um,

1243
01:12:15.150 --> 01:12:18.780
this person had died I think of an overdose and then the family decided to give

1244
01:12:18.781 --> 01:12:20.910
this face over.
So it's,

1245
01:12:20.911 --> 01:12:24.270
it's actually incredible what we can do when you think about,
you know,

1246
01:12:24.271 --> 01:12:27.690
from the battlefields of World War One to what Gillies doing to where we are

1247
01:12:27.691 --> 01:12:31.590
today with facial reconstruction and it's just going to get better and better.

1248
01:12:32.190 --> 01:12:34.410
<v 0>Yeah.
I'm sure it is going to get better and better.</v>

1249
01:12:34.411 --> 01:12:39.020
And for people with disfiguring injuries and things,
it's fantastic.
Yeah.

1250
01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:42.690
What freaks me out about botched is the psychological aspect of people

1251
01:12:42.691 --> 01:12:44.310
constantly tinkering with their looks.

1252
01:12:44.770 --> 01:12:45.440
<v 2>Yeah.
And,</v>

1253
01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:48.820
and now they have apps where you can upload your face and you can change things

1254
01:12:48.821 --> 01:12:50.330
about your face.
And it's just,
we're,

1255
01:12:50.620 --> 01:12:55.180
we're all becoming more and more insecure I think with social media.
Um,
and,

1256
01:12:55.580 --> 01:13:00.130
and yeah,
it's part of this world where we,
where nothing is real.

1257
01:13:01.070 --> 01:13:04.350
<v 0>Well,
that's the other part of it.
There's a lot of these pictures aren't real.
No.</v>

1258
01:13:04.370 --> 01:13:07.670
People are doctoring their photos to make themselves look different than they

1259
01:13:07.671 --> 01:13:10.610
actually do.
Look,
and then I know someone walks into the studio and you're like,

1260
01:13:10.611 --> 01:13:11.444
wait,
that's not the,

1261
01:13:11.660 --> 01:13:13.400
that's not what I thought that person was going to look like.

1262
01:13:14.060 --> 01:13:16.340
This a woman who is friends with my wife,

1263
01:13:16.341 --> 01:13:21.341
her neighbor is a model and she takes all of her photos with no makeup on and

1264
01:13:21.471 --> 01:13:26.210
then they put the makeup on her.
Oh my God,
I didn't know they could do that.
Yeah.

1265
01:13:26.211 --> 01:13:30.230
That's how they do it.
They do it all through Photoshop,
so she,
Jamie,

1266
01:13:30.231 --> 01:13:33.470
can you do that for [inaudible] in this video?
You can do whatever.

1267
01:13:33.500 --> 01:13:36.460
You can turn you into an Avatar.
Do you got anything?

1268
01:13:36.830 --> 01:13:38.420
But it's kind of crazy that they,

1269
01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:43.480
they take photos with no makeup and then add the eye shadow and all this wild

1270
01:13:45.090 --> 01:13:48.760
wheat.
Nothing's real.
Nothing is real anymore.
We kind of just,
what we're,

1271
01:13:48.920 --> 01:13:52.310
I think we're,
I mean,
I don't want to go down this road in this conversation,

1272
01:13:52.311 --> 01:13:54.890
but I think we're preparing ourselves for a time where nothing Israel,

1273
01:13:55.220 --> 01:13:58.640
I think you're preparing ourselves for a time where we live inside some sort of

1274
01:13:58.641 --> 01:13:59.474
a simulation.

1275
01:13:59.510 --> 01:14:00.680
<v 2>Yeah.
And I think on,</v>

1276
01:14:00.800 --> 01:14:05.180
it's interesting because celebrities like yourself have to really think about

1277
01:14:05.181 --> 01:14:07.610
how your image is used after you're gone as well now.

1278
01:14:07.611 --> 01:14:11.090
Like something that you didn't have to think about.
So,
um,
there was a commercial,

1279
01:14:11.230 --> 01:14:14.340
Audrey Hepburn in Britain and,
um,
she's,
it's,

1280
01:14:14.341 --> 01:14:18.610
it's a galaxy chocolate commercial and she's there and it looks like she's

1281
01:14:18.850 --> 01:14:23.380
eating a chocolate bar.
And so the ways that they can manipulate images and,
um,

1282
01:14:23.440 --> 01:14:26.500
and I think for the first time a lot of celebrities need to really think

1283
01:14:26.501 --> 01:14:30.370
carefully about whether they're okay with their images being used in certain

1284
01:14:30.371 --> 01:14:33.220
kinds of ways after their death.
Like,
who owns your image?

1285
01:14:33.430 --> 01:14:36.340
It's just like when you look at medical history in the past,

1286
01:14:36.460 --> 01:14:37.750
you don't own your body.

1287
01:14:37.751 --> 01:14:42.100
And so a lot of these surgeons get hold of these bodies to dissect and they're

1288
01:14:42.101 --> 01:14:45.430
digging them up from,
from graveyards.
I,
there were body snatchers,

1289
01:14:45.431 --> 01:14:47.110
they called themselves resurrection men.

1290
01:14:47.470 --> 01:14:50.830
And they would go into these cemeteries and they would dig up these bodies and

1291
01:14:50.831 --> 01:14:53.410
they would oftentimes strip the body naked because it was,

1292
01:14:53.440 --> 01:14:57.730
it was illegal to steal possessions from the corpse but not the body itself.

1293
01:14:58.240 --> 01:15:01.930
Cause there was no,
there was no concept of the body being sort of property.

1294
01:15:02.500 --> 01:15:05.510
So they would throw the clothes back into the grave and,

1295
01:15:05.710 --> 01:15:07.510
and they were really clever and the ways they did it,

1296
01:15:07.511 --> 01:15:09.770
they usually sent a woman in the daytime to,

1297
01:15:09.780 --> 01:15:13.600
to masquerade as a mourner and she would kind of go through the graveyard and

1298
01:15:13.601 --> 01:15:15.820
she would see where the fresh graves were.

1299
01:15:15.821 --> 01:15:18.340
Because of course you'd want the body to be as fresh as possible.

1300
01:15:18.520 --> 01:15:21.790
And then at nighttime they would go in there and they would dig up these bodies

1301
01:15:21.791 --> 01:15:24.190
and they could take as many as 12 bodies in a night.

1302
01:15:24.310 --> 01:15:28.360
It was like hard labor and it was very lucrative.
Um,

1303
01:15:28.390 --> 01:15:32.410
because the only legal bodies to dissect in Britain,
um,

1304
01:15:32.590 --> 01:15:37.210
in the early 19th century war bodies have executed criminals of people who had

1305
01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:40.150
murdered other people.
So specifically murders

1306
01:15:40.430 --> 01:15:44.870
<v 0>went to the like to say goodbye to your Nana and drop some flowers on a grave</v>

1307
01:15:44.871 --> 01:15:46.160
and there's just a big hole in the ground.

1308
01:15:46.260 --> 01:15:47.340
<v 2>Well,
they would cover it up,</v>

1309
01:15:47.400 --> 01:15:52.080
but you do get these stories of people finding out that a body.
So for instance,

1310
01:15:52.081 --> 01:15:55.590
I think it was in 1785 on this person,

1311
01:15:55.591 --> 01:15:58.380
goes to this graveyard and discovers that a body is missing,

1312
01:15:58.381 --> 01:16:02.700
that a body has been snatched and everybody in the village goes his graveyard

1313
01:16:02.701 --> 01:16:06.600
and digs up their relatives and drags these coffins back to their home until

1314
01:16:06.601 --> 01:16:08.670
they could make the cemetery safer,

1315
01:16:09.630 --> 01:16:12.780
which is insane because people were really feared this.
And um,

1316
01:16:12.930 --> 01:16:16.560
so yesterday on Twitter I put up a picture of something called the cemetery
gone.

1317
01:16:16.800 --> 01:16:19.770
So they had these devices that they would put at the foot of the grave and it

1318
01:16:20.280 --> 01:16:21.600
had like a trip wire.

1319
01:16:21.630 --> 01:16:25.710
And so you can set up the gun to shoot anybody you would god.
And there's,

1320
01:16:25.720 --> 01:16:29.250
there's actually really awful story of a grieving father who he there,

1321
01:16:29.251 --> 01:16:33.930
this was set up at the grave and he accidentally trips it and he gets shot.
So,

1322
01:16:33.931 --> 01:16:37.200
you know,
it wasn't,
it wasn't exactly a safe way to protect the bodies,

1323
01:16:37.201 --> 01:16:42.150
but they also have watchman look,
there it is.
That's what you were yesterday.

1324
01:16:42.160 --> 01:16:45.230
Your Twitter feed.
That's Twitter.
Yeah.
Everybody went nuts on that yesterday.

1325
01:16:45.250 --> 01:16:48.980
<v 0>Military gun,
19th centuries to protect against quality standards.</v>

1326
01:16:49.220 --> 01:16:51.610
That is so crazy.
It's a musket.

1327
01:16:51.740 --> 01:16:55.020
<v 2>Yeah,
it was hardcore.
I mean,
you'd have to be quite wealthy as well to,</v>

1328
01:16:55.090 --> 01:16:58.010
to set something like that up at the,
at the foot of your relatives grave.

1329
01:16:58.220 --> 01:17:03.080
They also used coffin collars.
So that was sort of like an iron.
Um,
well it was,

1330
01:17:03.081 --> 01:17:06.980
it was a collar and they would nail it to the bottom of the coffin,
so that way.

1331
01:17:06.981 --> 01:17:10.670
So what,
what a body snatcher would typically do,
just open the foot of the grave.

1332
01:17:10.820 --> 01:17:12.170
You wouldn't dig up the whole grave.

1333
01:17:12.380 --> 01:17:16.580
He'd Smash Open the lid and he'd have instruments to kind of drag the body out.

1334
01:17:16.820 --> 01:17:20.210
Well,
if the corpses nailed to the bottom of the coffin,

1335
01:17:20.211 --> 01:17:24.530
you're going to have a lot of trouble dragging that body out.
So people,

1336
01:17:24.950 --> 01:17:28.010
you know,
they did all kinds of things.
They put these cages over the,

1337
01:17:28.011 --> 01:17:32.150
over the graves to protect them.
So people,
the Internet,

1338
01:17:32.450 --> 01:17:37.450
God bless it will say to protect against vampire or to keep vampires from coming

1339
01:17:38.181 --> 01:17:40.010
out.
It had nothing to do with that or zombies.

1340
01:17:40.370 --> 01:17:44.270
It was to prevent body snatchers from getting ahold of those corpses.

1341
01:17:44.510 --> 01:17:48.530
But you know those bodies.
Yeah,
there they are.
Mort safes,

1342
01:17:48.560 --> 01:17:52.880
they were called God and you'll see them a lot in Britain.
Um,

1343
01:17:53.720 --> 01:17:56.750
and there they were,
people were very paranoid about this.
I mean,

1344
01:17:56.751 --> 01:18:01.751
you can find a lot of examples of this and bodies were stolen a lot and thank

1345
01:18:02.481 --> 01:18:04.250
God they were on some level,
right?

1346
01:18:04.251 --> 01:18:07.310
Because think about how much we learned from these bodies.

1347
01:18:07.311 --> 01:18:11.580
Bodies were needed to be dissected to teach medical students.
And,
um,

1348
01:18:11.630 --> 01:18:14.630
one of the scenes in the book,
I talk about the dead house,

1349
01:18:14.631 --> 01:18:18.340
they called it the dead house and everybody had a different experience in the

1350
01:18:18.350 --> 01:18:20.060
dead house.
There's probably people listening who've,

1351
01:18:20.120 --> 01:18:23.960
who've been in a dissection room and you have a really vivid memory of that.

1352
01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:27.410
It's probably bright and white and clinical.
Well,
these places,

1353
01:18:27.411 --> 01:18:30.760
the bodies would have been bloated and partly decomposed.
Uh,

1354
01:18:30.780 --> 01:18:34.550
dissecting bodies was dangerous because you could cut yourself and you can

1355
01:18:34.551 --> 01:18:38.990
infect yourself with bacteria.
They weren't wearing gloves.
Um,
and so you get,
uh,

1356
01:18:39.010 --> 01:18:42.380
examples of people cutting themselves and dying within 40 hours.

1357
01:18:42.381 --> 01:18:44.660
So going into Madison was dangerous.

1358
01:18:45.110 --> 01:18:50.110
And there's a story in this book about a guy who goes into the,

1359
01:18:51.141 --> 01:18:55.760
the dad house for the first time and he freaks out and he sees all these like

1360
01:18:56.300 --> 01:18:59.360
mice and rats and things like that,
eating the bodies.

1361
01:18:59.550 --> 01:19:03.260
And so he jumps out the window and he,
and he runs off,

1362
01:19:03.560 --> 01:19:06.140
but later he becomes a cost into it.

1363
01:19:06.141 --> 01:19:08.660
As we all become accustomed to horrible things at some point.

1364
01:19:08.900 --> 01:19:12.440
And he actually starts taking pieces of the corpse and throwing it to the poor

1365
01:19:12.441 --> 01:19:16.790
little starving creatures that are in the dead house.
And so he's kind of like,

1366
01:19:16.791 --> 01:19:20.030
you know,
that,
that horror that we all experienced possibly when we,

1367
01:19:20.031 --> 01:19:24.380
when we're confronted with death to accepting it as you have to as a medical

1368
01:19:24.381 --> 01:19:28.550
student if you want to go on.
Um,
so the dead houses is particularly,

1369
01:19:28.551 --> 01:19:31.550
it would have smelled,
um,
dissection would've,

1370
01:19:31.640 --> 01:19:35.000
would've been a winter sport because the body's wouldn't decompose this quickly.

1371
01:19:35.001 --> 01:19:39.050
You course wouldn't want to be dissecting in the heat of the summer.
Um,
and

1372
01:19:40.940 --> 01:19:43.460
yeah,
they would,
they would tend to teach students in the winter.

1373
01:19:43.461 --> 01:19:47.020
So it was cold winter jackets.
Yeah,
they will,

1374
01:19:47.100 --> 01:19:50.390
they would have probably cause while they had a fireplace at the end of the room

1375
01:19:50.391 --> 01:19:55.340
as well and make a really stuffy and smelly and you couldn't really predict what

1376
01:19:55.341 --> 01:19:57.170
a person had died from as well.
So remember,

1377
01:19:57.171 --> 01:20:01.080
people are dying from things like smallpox,
which is awful.
Um,

1378
01:20:01.160 --> 01:20:05.420
and this is before bass vaccinations.
This is certainly before antibiotics.

1379
01:20:05.421 --> 01:20:09.210
And so a lot of doctors or medical students die as a result of going into the

1380
01:20:09.211 --> 01:20:13.170
profession.
Oh Wow.
So there are they getting it from these courses.

1381
01:20:13.380 --> 01:20:16.380
People that die,
they can get bacterial infections certainly.

1382
01:20:16.381 --> 01:20:17.820
And just being with patients.

1383
01:20:17.821 --> 01:20:22.410
If a patient comes in and smallpox and smallpox,
a lot of people,

1384
01:20:22.440 --> 01:20:25.770
I don't know if I,
did I send you a picture of smallpox,
Jamie.
Um,

1385
01:20:25.830 --> 01:20:29.880
a lot of people think,
oh,
it's,
it's like chicken pox.
It's not like chicken pox.

1386
01:20:29.881 --> 01:20:32.220
It's,
it's a really awful disease.
Um,

1387
01:20:32.221 --> 01:20:36.780
and it's the only disease that we have eradicated ever in human history.

1388
01:20:36.870 --> 01:20:40.700
Yeah.
Um,
which is incredible.
So it's,
it's one of those ones.
Yeah.
There,

1389
01:20:41.100 --> 01:20:45.240
it's unbelievably bad.
It makes me itch.
When I looked at it,
horrific.
Um,

1390
01:20:45.300 --> 01:20:46.140
very disfigured

1391
01:20:46.680 --> 01:20:49.140
<v 0>with it.
It's just,
and it was so common.</v>

1392
01:20:49.240 --> 01:20:50.560
<v 2>It was very common.
It was,</v>

1393
01:20:50.590 --> 01:20:54.550
it was very feared as well because it was so disfiguring.
And so if you were,

1394
01:20:54.551 --> 01:20:58.390
for instance,
a wealthy woman and you got smallpox and you were scarred,

1395
01:20:58.660 --> 01:21:02.020
your family might worry that they couldn't marry you off.
So,
you know,

1396
01:21:02.021 --> 01:21:06.900
it was one of those diseases that left its mark on you,
literally.
Um,
and,

1397
01:21:06.920 --> 01:21:11.680
and it also had a high mortality rate as well,
but it wasn't like chicken pox.
No,

1398
01:21:11.860 --> 01:21:15.070
there's my PSA.
It's not like chicken pox.

1399
01:21:15.380 --> 01:21:17.660
<v 0>Well,
it's,
uh,
you know,</v>

1400
01:21:17.840 --> 01:21:21.500
it's one of those things that we're so thankful that people have figured out how

1401
01:21:21.501 --> 01:21:22.570
to get rid of something.

1402
01:21:22.610 --> 01:21:26.180
<v 2>Yeah.
And,
and,
um,
and smallpox vaccine was invented in the 18th century.</v>

1403
01:21:26.181 --> 01:21:29.600
Most people don't know it's,
it's that old,
um,
doctor.
Yeah.

1404
01:21:29.601 --> 01:21:31.010
Edward Jenner invented it.

1405
01:21:31.011 --> 01:21:36.011
And actually the biggest anti-vaxxer movement or a protest happened in the 19th

1406
01:21:36.831 --> 01:21:41.030
century.
100,000 people turned out to March and Britain against Jenner,

1407
01:21:41.270 --> 01:21:42.470
people thought that,
um,

1408
01:21:42.530 --> 01:21:47.120
their children return into cows because he used cow pox,
the virus,

1409
01:21:47.121 --> 01:21:51.830
cow pox to bestow immunity onto people.
And so there was this huge fear that,

1410
01:21:52.070 --> 01:21:56.390
um,
you know,
it was dirty to kind of insert this animal virus into people.

1411
01:21:56.810 --> 01:21:58.520
And so there was this big protest,

1412
01:21:58.560 --> 01:22:02.270
100,000 people to protest the fact that six parents had been jailed for not

1413
01:22:02.271 --> 01:22:06.500
vaccinating their children.
And so the stories is much older than we think.

1414
01:22:06.740 --> 01:22:11.300
And the fears that we have about vaccines are not that dissimilar to what people

1415
01:22:11.301 --> 01:22:15.350
worried about in the past as well.
But gender is in an incredible figure.

1416
01:22:15.690 --> 01:22:19.080
<v 0>That is incredible when you stop and think about the fact that this is still</v>

1417
01:22:19.081 --> 01:22:22.890
going on today with the Internet.
Yeah.
Yeah.
All the mean.

1418
01:22:22.891 --> 01:22:24.090
You can find out.

1419
01:22:24.091 --> 01:22:29.091
I mean I had doctor Peter Hotez on recently to talk about vaccines and the

1420
01:22:29.401 --> 01:22:34.290
misconceptions that people have and he explained that they have isolated a bunch

1421
01:22:34.291 --> 01:22:38.520
of different environmental factors,
the end genes that contribute to autism,

1422
01:22:38.521 --> 01:22:39.990
but that all takes place in the womb.

1423
01:22:40.300 --> 01:22:42.760
<v 2>Right.
But people don't want to hear that.
No,
I mean it,</v>

1424
01:22:42.761 --> 01:22:46.310
and that is the danger of the way information is now spread.
Of course,

1425
01:22:46.370 --> 01:22:47.203
echo chambers.

1426
01:22:47.900 --> 01:22:51.630
It's confirmation bias is the real danger that people get around wasn't,

1427
01:22:52.010 --> 01:22:56.930
it was actually harder to get that message out.
But I'm a lot of,
uh,
you know,

1428
01:22:56.931 --> 01:22:59.630
you get famous sort of,
um,
cartoons of,

1429
01:22:59.900 --> 01:23:03.410
of people sort of turning into cows to the cartoon is my new husband is

1430
01:23:03.411 --> 01:23:03.920
cartoonists.

1431
01:23:03.920 --> 01:23:07.930
And so it's like this way of this powerful way of kind of conveying images and

1432
01:23:07.931 --> 01:23:10.510
fears and stuff.
And um,
so yeah,
people,

1433
01:23:10.540 --> 01:23:14.020
people had that fear of vaccines for a long time,

1434
01:23:14.021 --> 01:23:18.490
but Edward Jenner coming up with his vaccine undoubtedly saved millions of

1435
01:23:18.491 --> 01:23:21.940
people's lives.
It's so amazing that,

1436
01:23:22.060 --> 01:23:25.780
that the problem is still around today.

1437
01:23:26.290 --> 01:23:29.920
We even with all the information that we have available.
Yeah.
I think,
you know,

1438
01:23:29.921 --> 01:23:32.310
there was,
um,
a Fox News,
uh,

1439
01:23:32.670 --> 01:23:37.390
a newscaster who recently said that he doesn't wash his hands because he can't

1440
01:23:37.391 --> 01:23:39.040
see germs.
I don't know who it was.

1441
01:23:40.150 --> 01:23:43.810
Hopefully was joking actually wash those hands.
I hope so.

1442
01:23:43.811 --> 01:23:47.710
So people were sending that to me because again,
like lister and,
um,

1443
01:23:47.720 --> 01:23:52.030
and I always tell people,
you know,
it is that idea of what you can't see.

1444
01:23:52.031 --> 01:23:55.990
It's hard to convince people.
And with lister,
you know,
if you think about it,

1445
01:23:55.991 --> 01:23:58.420
here's this young guy and he's coming along and he's saying there are these

1446
01:23:58.421 --> 01:24:02.710
invisible little creatures and they're killing your patients and trust me,

1447
01:24:03.070 --> 01:24:05.950
I have this really weird instrument called the microscope and I can see them.

1448
01:24:05.980 --> 01:24:07.240
And it was a leap of faith.

1449
01:24:07.510 --> 01:24:11.530
He was also accusing the older surgeons of inadvertently killing their patients

1450
01:24:11.531 --> 01:24:12.730
because if they weren't washing their hands,

1451
01:24:12.731 --> 01:24:14.440
they were leading to higher mortality rates.

1452
01:24:14.490 --> 01:24:17.140
So they probably fall against it as well.
Yeah.
So there was,

1453
01:24:17.141 --> 01:24:18.220
there was huge push back.

1454
01:24:18.221 --> 01:24:21.490
So what lister ultimately does is he turns to the younger generation and he

1455
01:24:21.491 --> 01:24:25.690
changes their minds.
And so it's a slow burn.
It's not like,
you know,

1456
01:24:25.691 --> 01:24:27.280
the movie moment unfortunately,

1457
01:24:27.281 --> 01:24:31.990
where it just happens all at once and it takes quite a long time.
Um,

1458
01:24:32.050 --> 01:24:32.441
and it's,

1459
01:24:32.441 --> 01:24:36.670
it's weird that it takes so long because if you think about him coming in 1876

1460
01:24:36.730 --> 01:24:40.450
to America,
it's after the civil war,
people were dying,

1461
01:24:40.451 --> 01:24:43.900
soldiers were dying of high infection rates.
They were packing wounds with mud.

1462
01:24:44.440 --> 01:24:46.990
I mean,
it couldn't get worse than that.
Right.

1463
01:24:46.991 --> 01:24:49.420
And so people were dying of all the,
all of these kinds of infections.

1464
01:24:49.421 --> 01:24:52.630
He comes to Philadelphia to convince the medical community.

1465
01:24:52.960 --> 01:24:55.810
And Speaker after speaker just denounce his,

1466
01:24:55.811 --> 01:24:58.680
him on the first day and then he gets up and he,

1467
01:24:58.681 --> 01:25:02.590
he does his demonstrations and he starts to slowly change people's minds.

1468
01:25:02.830 --> 01:25:07.660
But it takes a long time.
The,
the cover of the,
um,
of the American book is,

1469
01:25:07.661 --> 01:25:10.240
um,
the American version I should say is,

1470
01:25:10.241 --> 01:25:14.350
I'm a famous painting by people can see that by Samuel Gross.

1471
01:25:14.530 --> 01:25:18.190
It's called the gross clinic.
I'm the guy in the middle.
It is gross as well,

1472
01:25:18.191 --> 01:25:19.630
but the guy in the middle of Samuel Gross,

1473
01:25:19.631 --> 01:25:23.440
and he's so didn't believe in lister that he would walk into the room and he'd

1474
01:25:23.441 --> 01:25:27.160
slam the door and he'd say,
there,
Mister Lister's germs can't get in anymore.

1475
01:25:27.580 --> 01:25:30.760
And you can see in this that he stick,
he's wearing his street clothes,

1476
01:25:30.761 --> 01:25:33.790
he's sticking his dirty fingers into this wound.
Um,

1477
01:25:33.970 --> 01:25:38.050
and there's a woman in the background and she's covering her face and she's the

1478
01:25:38.051 --> 01:25:42.160
mother of the patient and she's wearing black because she expects her son to
die.

1479
01:25:42.780 --> 01:25:46.360
So,
so this is the US cover and for the UK cover,

1480
01:25:46.361 --> 01:25:49.510
I think I sent that to you Jamie.
Um,
it's a,

1481
01:25:49.511 --> 01:25:51.850
I sent you a picture of both covers side by side.

1482
01:25:51.851 --> 01:25:55.900
It's another painting by Eakins and it was done within 10 years and it's called

1483
01:25:55.901 --> 01:25:56.711
the Agnew clinic.

1484
01:25:56.711 --> 01:26:00.100
And it's totally different because the doctors are wearing white.

1485
01:26:00.101 --> 01:26:01.810
There's a sense that they understand germs,

1486
01:26:01.811 --> 01:26:04.100
there's a sense of antisepsis been used there.

1487
01:26:04.310 --> 01:26:07.940
So that kind of before and after shot in such a short period that listers able

1488
01:26:07.941 --> 01:26:08.870
to change the world.

1489
01:26:09.020 --> 01:26:12.500
What made you choose a different covers for the UK and the US version?
Well,

1490
01:26:12.501 --> 01:26:16.040
so that's actually,
writers don't,
Oh there you go.
So you can see.

1491
01:26:16.100 --> 01:26:20.000
So penguin published it in the UK,
so they've stylized the original painting,

1492
01:26:20.001 --> 01:26:23.240
but you kind of get a sense of what it would've looked like on any,

1493
01:26:23.250 --> 01:26:27.890
and actually you have women appearing in the operating theater professionally as

1494
01:26:27.891 --> 01:26:31.550
nurses.
So this is after the Florence Nightingale Revolution as well.

1495
01:26:31.730 --> 01:26:34.550
So it still looks different to the way we operate.

1496
01:26:34.551 --> 01:26:37.850
But you can definitely see a difference between those two paintings.

1497
01:26:37.910 --> 01:26:41.420
Can you refresh my memory and the Florence Nightingale Revolution.
So Florence,

1498
01:26:42.450 --> 01:26:44.840
Florence Nightingale is in this book a little bit.

1499
01:26:44.841 --> 01:26:47.660
People always wonder why I didn't speak about her is much.

1500
01:26:47.661 --> 01:26:49.670
But actually she didn't believe in germs at first.

1501
01:26:49.671 --> 01:26:53.720
She thought lister was quite a hysterical with his idea of germs,

1502
01:26:53.870 --> 01:26:56.240
but she was working towards sanitation in hospitals.

1503
01:26:56.241 --> 01:26:59.900
So they're working towards the same goal but just with different slightly

1504
01:26:59.901 --> 01:27:03.600
different tactics.
So she revolutionizes nursing,
um,

1505
01:27:03.620 --> 01:27:07.370
to make it a more respectable profession.
Before then nurses,

1506
01:27:07.400 --> 01:27:10.550
you wouldn't want your daughter becoming a nurse if you were from a well

1507
01:27:10.551 --> 01:27:15.050
respected family because it was,
she would be privy to the male body.

1508
01:27:15.290 --> 01:27:20.000
So you wouldn't want her interacting with male patients.
So really kind of lowly,

1509
01:27:20.320 --> 01:27:23.930
um,
poorer women went into nursing.
Um,

1510
01:27:23.931 --> 01:27:27.530
and it wasn't really a respected profession until Florence Nightingale comes

1511
01:27:27.531 --> 01:27:28.850
along and there's this sort of revolution.

1512
01:27:28.851 --> 01:27:31.070
So the revolution is not just about the profession though,

1513
01:27:31.071 --> 01:27:34.400
but it's about the sanitation reforms that she brings about in the hospitals.

1514
01:27:34.790 --> 01:27:38.540
So you see that on the cover as well.
But there's,
there's also another guy,

1515
01:27:38.541 --> 01:27:42.440
I'm sure there's like,
I can,
I always like sorta predict comments.

1516
01:27:42.470 --> 01:27:44.330
I shouldn't think about,
you know,
what people are going to say,

1517
01:27:44.331 --> 01:27:48.110
but people tend to get mad.
I'm like,
when I give lectures,

1518
01:27:48.111 --> 01:27:51.330
because I don't talk about this guy,
there's,
there's groupies out there,
um,

1519
01:27:51.620 --> 01:27:53.930
that love this physician named Semmelweis.

1520
01:27:53.960 --> 01:27:57.660
And I do talk about them in the book a little bit.
So Semmelweiss was this,

1521
01:27:57.980 --> 01:28:01.880
I call them groupies,
Semmelweiss groupies because every time I give a talk,

1522
01:28:01.970 --> 01:28:05.210
there's always one person who asked this question and I have to spell it myself.

1523
01:28:05.210 --> 01:28:07.130
And I'm like,
ah,
here it is.
And they say,

1524
01:28:07.131 --> 01:28:11.620
why I think you'll find you haven't talked about Semmelweiss Semmelweiss,
uh,
was,

1525
01:28:11.621 --> 01:28:15.590
was practicing in Austria and he was putting this idea to gather that if you

1526
01:28:15.591 --> 01:28:20.130
wash your hands and you go onto the hospital wards,
infection rates went down.
Um,

1527
01:28:20.480 --> 01:28:23.060
and they call,
he was ridiculed heavily.

1528
01:28:23.061 --> 01:28:27.170
They call them the hand washer and he ends up being put in an insane asylum and

1529
01:28:27.171 --> 01:28:31.290
it's this really kind of sad,
weird death that he has.
And,
um,

1530
01:28:31.320 --> 01:28:35.600
and he's really sort of,
um,
persecuted for these ideas of hand washing and,

1531
01:28:35.660 --> 01:28:36.710
and infection rates.

1532
01:28:36.830 --> 01:28:41.390
He's doing it a little bit before lister comes onto the scene listers,

1533
01:28:41.391 --> 01:28:44.270
not aware of some of vices work,
but equally,

1534
01:28:44.271 --> 01:28:48.080
I always tell people that some of vice doesn't really do it first if we're,

1535
01:28:48.110 --> 01:28:50.960
if we're going to play that game.
Because again,

1536
01:28:51.230 --> 01:28:55.490
there's a difference between the basic sanitation and then understanding why

1537
01:28:55.491 --> 01:28:58.160
you're implementing it.
So until you understand that germs exist,

1538
01:28:58.161 --> 01:29:00.890
it doesn't make sense.
You can't really convince people.
And that's,

1539
01:29:01.170 --> 01:29:03.930
lister comes in,
he takes lead pastors germ theory,

1540
01:29:04.230 --> 01:29:08.460
and he's able to convince people,
I'm in the medical community that germs exist.

1541
01:29:08.940 --> 01:29:11.160
So until we understand,
you know,
again,

1542
01:29:11.161 --> 01:29:15.180
why wash your hands if they're just going to get dirty?
That's amazing.

1543
01:29:15.750 --> 01:29:19.890
So I get why did you have two different covers?
Oh,
yes.
Um,

1544
01:29:20.250 --> 01:29:24.360
so the,
the publisher just picks whatever covers they want basically on.

1545
01:29:24.361 --> 01:29:26.280
So my us publisher had come up with this.

1546
01:29:26.550 --> 01:29:31.500
My UK publisher came up with a cover.
I didn't like that much.
And so I said,
well,

1547
01:29:31.501 --> 01:29:34.480
why don't we use the second Eakins paintings so that they're,
um,

1548
01:29:34.650 --> 01:29:36.000
in conversation with one another.

1549
01:29:36.001 --> 01:29:39.680
So I like that they kind of compliment one another.
I like the font better.

1550
01:29:40.530 --> 01:29:40.921
I know,

1551
01:29:40.921 --> 01:29:45.510
I love this Victorian Font and the image of that guy wearing street clothes is

1552
01:29:45.511 --> 01:29:50.220
just more,
it's so evocative.
I,
you know,
it's just this book,

1553
01:29:50.221 --> 01:29:54.150
this cover actually,
so it's been translated,
I think it's about 15 languages now.

1554
01:29:54.151 --> 01:29:56.910
So most of them kind of take this,
this image.

1555
01:29:57.060 --> 01:30:00.450
I was wondering if you knew what this might be.
This is,

1556
01:30:00.451 --> 01:30:03.810
so it's a circular metal metal contraption,
um,

1557
01:30:03.840 --> 01:30:06.420
with teeth on the inside for people who are just listening.

1558
01:30:07.470 --> 01:30:10.440
So this is called the Geogen penis.
This is an,

1559
01:30:10.530 --> 01:30:15.510
a Victorian anti masturbation device.
So yay.
There's the real one.

1560
01:30:15.511 --> 01:30:18.900
This is,
this is a prop that I use for under the knife.
Um,
that's the real ones.

1561
01:30:18.901 --> 01:30:21.480
So what would happen is if the person got an erection,

1562
01:30:21.481 --> 01:30:25.860
it would clamp down and obviously kill the erection pretty quickly.
Yeah,

1563
01:30:27.720 --> 01:30:32.110
that's one we made for the show.
Yeah.
It's basically,

1564
01:30:32.850 --> 01:30:37.470
it's similar.
If you see like the one on the screen,
it has a spring device.

1565
01:30:38.120 --> 01:30:41.300
So these,
they were trying,
why were they trying to get people to stop?

1566
01:30:41.670 --> 01:30:44.430
So the Victorians were obsessed with,
with masturbation.

1567
01:30:44.990 --> 01:30:48.210
And there's probably a lot of people out there who know that Kellogg's

1568
01:30:48.211 --> 01:30:52.460
cornflakes came out of this sort of obsession with masturbation story.

1569
01:30:52.920 --> 01:30:57.090
We heard it from Dr Chris Ryan.
Oh,
it's so funny.
Well,
it's funny.

1570
01:30:57.091 --> 01:31:01.530
In a Haha kind of horrifying way.
Um,
Kellogg was,
was obsessed with,

1571
01:31:01.531 --> 01:31:02.370
with masturbation.

1572
01:31:02.371 --> 01:31:05.010
He thought that a lot of his patients were suffering from all kinds of mental

1573
01:31:05.011 --> 01:31:07.590
ailments and physical ailments because they were masturbating too much.

1574
01:31:07.890 --> 01:31:11.730
And he thought that a diet bland in a bland,

1575
01:31:11.731 --> 01:31:15.060
in high in fiber would kind of kill the fire in the belly.

1576
01:31:15.420 --> 01:31:18.630
And so he invented what became Kellogg's cornflakes.

1577
01:31:19.050 --> 01:31:22.260
But his brother was the one who commercialized and his brothers like,

1578
01:31:22.261 --> 01:31:25.170
we should add sugar.
And Dr. Kelly was like,
no,
people,

1579
01:31:25.171 --> 01:31:27.180
we masturbating all the time.
We can't add sugar,
you know?

1580
01:31:27.181 --> 01:31:29.580
And they had this split and Kellogg's corn flakes.

1581
01:31:29.760 --> 01:31:32.670
It became the commercial version with the delicious sugar added in.

1582
01:31:32.880 --> 01:31:34.560
So that was the brother's idea.

1583
01:31:34.590 --> 01:31:37.200
It was the brother's idea to add the sugar and make it sort of delicious.

1584
01:31:37.230 --> 01:31:42.210
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.
That's,
that was a um,
uh,
illustrated by my husband.

1585
01:31:42.510 --> 01:31:47.460
We do all kinds of,
yeah.
For you too.
So that's not an original.

1586
01:31:47.610 --> 01:31:52.480
No,
no.
Heard your son and heir dirty little self abuser.

1587
01:31:52.880 --> 01:31:57.630
Stop All contemptible.
Is this an actual text from,
uh,
you know,

1588
01:31:58.230 --> 01:31:59.063
I don't know.
I,

1589
01:32:00.810 --> 01:32:03.730
<v 3>I doubt it.
A cock lane in London though.</v>

1590
01:32:05.980 --> 01:32:09.760
Stop All contemptible.
Oh Nan in Islam,

1591
01:32:09.790 --> 01:32:14.260
what is own an ism?
Masturbating and [inaudible].
Have you ever heard that

1592
01:32:15.970 --> 01:32:20.680
with the infallible and modestly priced juke him penis.

1593
01:32:21.400 --> 01:32:25.630
So was that a common thing during the Victorian era?
So yeah,

1594
01:32:25.631 --> 01:32:30.130
you get the idea that masturbating is bad for your health goes to the 18th

1595
01:32:30.131 --> 01:32:33.690
century.
We kind of tend to think about it is a Victorian obsession cause it,

1596
01:32:33.750 --> 01:32:38.750
it becomes more and more accepted idea in medical terms but that it's bad for

1597
01:32:41.951 --> 01:32:45.570
you and you get these like sort of drawings of men like languishing on the
couch.

1598
01:32:45.571 --> 01:32:48.400
Cause like masturbated too much or whatever is out there right now that can

1599
01:32:48.401 --> 01:32:51.670
relate.
Yeah.
Energy,
you know,

1600
01:32:51.880 --> 01:32:54.290
they just need the chicken penis and,

1601
01:32:54.410 --> 01:32:57.910
and also there's another one I sent you Jamie.
I think that this sort of like,

1602
01:32:58.060 --> 01:33:02.080
it looks like a flacid penis.
It's really high.
Yeah.

1603
01:33:02.260 --> 01:33:07.210
They came in all shapes and sizes and yeah,
like now it would probably just be,

1604
01:33:07.211 --> 01:33:09.940
yeah,
they're just supposed to pee out of that.
Yeah,

1605
01:33:09.941 --> 01:33:14.360
maybe you cuss it actually the end of it,
like you have to just,
there is,

1606
01:33:14.361 --> 01:33:15.680
there are examples

1607
01:33:17.730 --> 01:33:22.730
for the bottom was the hook that seems super uncomfortable.

1608
01:33:23.250 --> 01:33:25.630
Where is that thing sits in between your legs.

1609
01:33:26.800 --> 01:33:29.830
So it must be like a hook where you could strap it in and drop it in

1610
01:33:32.110 --> 01:33:36.730
a tie.
Steel Cup.
I don't know who's coming on the show afterwards,

1611
01:33:36.731 --> 01:33:41.140
but they got a lot of,
the good news is Ron is a hilarious comedian,

1612
01:33:41.360 --> 01:33:42.193
so

1613
01:33:44.950 --> 01:33:49.950
I might have to Redo the entire show just with Ron and his take on all this

1614
01:33:50.291 --> 01:33:54.320
stuff.
Yeah,
just show the,
I'll just leave these objects behind the cup too.

1615
01:33:54.340 --> 01:33:58.240
A little.
It's so gross.
It's gross and the fact you're the pee out of those,

1616
01:33:58.780 --> 01:34:02.240
a spaghetti strainer at the end of it,
I knew,
I thought,
you know what?

1617
01:34:02.240 --> 01:34:03.100
I was going on the show.
I'm like,

1618
01:34:03.101 --> 01:34:07.660
what can I bring Joe Rogan that's going to stimulate the conversation and the

1619
01:34:07.700 --> 01:34:10.680
anti masturbation device,
it's a crowd pleaser with men.

1620
01:34:11.560 --> 01:34:13.170
It's always an issue of fascination.

1621
01:34:13.550 --> 01:34:17.380
They thought that it was causing all these ailments.

1622
01:34:17.440 --> 01:34:21.580
They thought it was causing all these different problems and Graham crackers as

1623
01:34:21.581 --> 01:34:23.050
well come out of that.

1624
01:34:23.051 --> 01:34:28.030
So Reverend Graham was also obsessed with masturbation,
just like Kellogg.

1625
01:34:28.031 --> 01:34:30.800
And so he created this sort of dry,
tasteless.

1626
01:34:31.570 --> 01:34:35.020
So everybody crumbling them into their little,

1627
01:34:35.021 --> 01:34:39.010
did he know that smores and makes it pretty fucking awesome.

1628
01:34:40.560 --> 01:34:44.100
Add marshmallows [inaudible] right.
So we're just like,

1629
01:34:45.520 --> 01:34:46.570
I don't know if it works.

1630
01:34:46.571 --> 01:34:49.600
If people feel like that that's helping them with their masturbation problems,

1631
01:34:49.601 --> 01:34:52.670
but hey,
leave a comment.
Which is crazy that people didn't,

1632
01:34:52.750 --> 01:34:55.810
most people have no idea that that was the origin of this stuff.

1633
01:34:55.810 --> 01:34:59.360
That's what's so funny.
You know,
there's,
there's so many like Listerine,

1634
01:34:59.361 --> 01:35:01.160
Graham crackers,
Kellogg corn flakes,

1635
01:35:01.161 --> 01:35:05.780
all this kind of stuff that that has sort of a medical background or a medical

1636
01:35:05.781 --> 01:35:07.600
background in,
um,

1637
01:35:07.760 --> 01:35:12.580
the term hysterical that hysterical was related to women.

1638
01:35:12.600 --> 01:35:15.950
Yeah.
The idea that the womb wanders like,
so people thought that the,

1639
01:35:15.951 --> 01:35:20.900
that the female wound was like an animal in and of itself,
which I know,
you know,

1640
01:35:21.210 --> 01:35:25.550
um,
and it would move around the body and so they would even do things like they

1641
01:35:25.551 --> 01:35:29.270
would smoke it back into place,
they'd put like smoke.

1642
01:35:29.810 --> 01:35:33.050
They would put like incense and all kinds of things to kind of like get it,

1643
01:35:33.051 --> 01:35:34.820
like coax it back into place.

1644
01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.700
I can't even imagine that people are going to start following me after this

1645
01:35:38.030 --> 01:35:42.080
based off of these,
these weird stories come to my platform.

1646
01:35:42.081 --> 01:35:45.580
I have tons of different stories like this,
but there was,
um,

1647
01:35:46.010 --> 01:35:51.010
there was a time where women would go to the doctor to get stimulated as well.

1648
01:35:52.320 --> 01:35:55.640
Right.
Is that true?
Or is it,
so this is like a little bit out of my expertise.

1649
01:35:55.641 --> 01:35:59.750
I think that's been proven to be false.
Actually on,
but,
but there was,

1650
01:35:59.780 --> 01:36:02.210
I believe,
and I could be wrong on this,

1651
01:36:02.211 --> 01:36:07.211
that there was a Victorian idea that a woman had to orgasm in order to become

1652
01:36:07.341 --> 01:36:10.250
pregnant.
So that was,
that was an important part of it.

1653
01:36:10.290 --> 01:36:11.900
I wasn't just a Victorian thing.

1654
01:36:11.930 --> 01:36:14.180
I'm pretty sure they taught me that in high school.

1655
01:36:14.560 --> 01:36:17.920
What are you closes?
They're like,

1656
01:36:18.250 --> 01:36:19.640
if you want to get a woman pregnant,

1657
01:36:19.840 --> 01:36:24.840
made sure she harkness ideas as part of the male orgasming inside the woman was

1658
01:36:25.281 --> 01:36:28.640
what led to her having an orgasm,
which would lead to her getting pregnant.

1659
01:36:28.970 --> 01:36:31.400
That is weird.
Well there was,
there was,

1660
01:36:31.430 --> 01:36:35.270
I think it was like a sign of completely [inaudible].

1661
01:36:35.490 --> 01:36:39.260
I was probably 15 at the time.
Well there you go.
But there was,

1662
01:36:39.261 --> 01:36:42.680
there was someone on,
I think it was like a senator or Congress.

1663
01:36:42.710 --> 01:36:46.000
I live in the UK now,
so I'm not as up to date with,

1664
01:36:46.030 --> 01:36:48.950
with all the crazy stuff going on over here.
Um,

1665
01:36:49.070 --> 01:36:52.100
but I think there was like a senator who said this again,

1666
01:36:52.101 --> 01:36:56.120
this idea that a woman had to like orgasm it meeting undermining the idea that

1667
01:36:56.121 --> 01:37:00.230
you couldn't be great unless you had an orgasm,
which was a Victorian.

1668
01:37:01.490 --> 01:37:05.750
Yeah,
I think that was really recently.
Yeah,
I think it was like in the last year.

1669
01:37:05.751 --> 01:37:10.751
I hate to say like how should this be like in the background popping up and like

1670
01:37:12.441 --> 01:37:15.460
I could have like a sign that says 18th century or 19th.
So you know,

1671
01:37:15.461 --> 01:37:19.580
like where did that idea come from originally?
And that's,
I do have this weird,

1672
01:37:19.640 --> 01:37:24.530
weird,
vague memory that that was the way that you were taught.

1673
01:37:25.900 --> 01:37:29.870
It's too weird.
I don't remember.
It's too vague.

1674
01:37:30.380 --> 01:37:31.340
It does sound too weird.

1675
01:37:31.341 --> 01:37:34.760
Like I now I picture you went to like a really big Torian school and went to a

1676
01:37:34.761 --> 01:37:38.660
place called Newton,
south suburb of Boston.
Really Nice.
Cool.

1677
01:37:39.200 --> 01:37:42.830
Nothing wrong with it other than other than that,
your sex Ed,

1678
01:37:43.280 --> 01:37:47.840
I'm not sure if that was,
and did they pass out the Jig and penis as well after?

1679
01:37:48.590 --> 01:37:49.740
They did smack are,

1680
01:37:53.270 --> 01:37:58.270
but why were people so with that while they have soap sells self pleasuring.

1681
01:37:58.480 --> 01:38:00.030
Yeah.
And I think that again,
you know,

1682
01:38:00.031 --> 01:38:05.031
you look at that sort of buttoned up Victorian mentality like dresses over the

1683
01:38:05.791 --> 01:38:10.020
legs of pianos and chairs and stuff like that.
I don't know about that.

1684
01:38:10.021 --> 01:38:13.890
I think they did it because it had been provocative.

1685
01:38:14.930 --> 01:38:19.770
It might be more bullshit that I remember,
but I really do remember something.

1686
01:38:19.770 --> 01:38:22.240
I like the fact check this before I just did.
It's Horse Shit,
right?

1687
01:38:22.241 --> 01:38:26.850
It says it's not real.
Oh,
okay.
You know what?
I remember where I heard it from,

1688
01:38:26.880 --> 01:38:28.080
I heard it from Terence Mckenna.

1689
01:38:28.500 --> 01:38:30.930
It was one of the things he talked about during one of his,
uh,

1690
01:38:30.990 --> 01:38:34.360
his speeches there.
That's right.
We did.
We did fact check that.
I mean,

1691
01:38:34.410 --> 01:38:37.980
we like to think that,
that the past is really different from us,

1692
01:38:38.010 --> 01:38:40.050
which it is in some ways,
but you know,
again,

1693
01:38:40.051 --> 01:38:44.850
like we still share some similar fears and the masturbation thing.
Actually,

1694
01:38:44.851 --> 01:38:48.350
the last thing I want to show you that I brought is this.

1695
01:38:48.820 --> 01:38:50.620
So this is,

1696
01:38:51.060 --> 01:38:54.540
this is a urine wheel that would date to the medieval period.

1697
01:38:55.860 --> 01:39:00.690
And so the idea was that the doctor could diagnose you according to the color of

1698
01:39:00.691 --> 01:39:04.170
your urine.
Spoiler alert if your urine is black,
you're probably in big trouble.

1699
01:39:06.900 --> 01:39:10.290
Just,
yeah,
they didn't
look at the color.

1700
01:39:10.291 --> 01:39:14.890
They tasted the urine as well.
Areas so,
so and,

1701
01:39:14.891 --> 01:39:18.810
and they could diagnose diabetes because someone with diabetes,

1702
01:39:18.811 --> 01:39:23.140
their urine tastes sweet.
So they were actually diagnosing diabetes.
Yeah,

1703
01:39:23.141 --> 01:39:25.030
there you go.
That's the one we based it off yet.

1704
01:39:25.910 --> 01:39:30.300
But my favorite part of the urine in the medieval period and doctors with your,

1705
01:39:30.510 --> 01:39:35.280
they some,
some practitioners would take the urine and put it into a divination,

1706
01:39:35.640 --> 01:39:39.550
a bowl and they could tell your future and I think they should bring that back,

1707
01:39:39.800 --> 01:39:44.010
you know,
at the end of your checkout,
not to be covered by insurance,

1708
01:39:44.011 --> 01:39:45.300
but you know,
out of pocket,

1709
01:39:47.310 --> 01:39:49.990
totally dehydrated and there's blood,

1710
01:39:52.540 --> 01:39:56.070
do the divination ball.
You don't have to do that.
Well it's weird that image,

1711
01:39:56.730 --> 01:39:59.440
the whole circle,
the center circle,

1712
01:39:59.441 --> 01:40:04.441
like a guy is the doctor holding the flask or the doctor.

1713
01:40:05.170 --> 01:40:05.490
Yep.

1714
01:40:05.490 --> 01:40:08.410
That would be the doctor holding the flask and actually it's like a wine taster.

1715
01:40:11.330 --> 01:40:14.700
Again,
a youtube video on this,
which is why I have this stupid prop.
And um,

1716
01:40:14.830 --> 01:40:19.830
we cut through images in that image of the doctor holding the flask was sort of

1717
01:40:19.921 --> 01:40:23.760
the predominant image of a physician up into a certain period.

1718
01:40:24.630 --> 01:40:27.540
Now it's sort of like the stethoscope is the,

1719
01:40:28.200 --> 01:40:33.200
is the object now that we associate with doctors but for a year and flask used

1720
01:40:34.681 --> 01:40:38.160
to be it
and the,

1721
01:40:40.820 --> 01:40:41.760
and the plague mask,

1722
01:40:43.440 --> 01:40:46.650
but they used to call him piss profits because they tell your fortune using your

1723
01:40:46.651 --> 01:40:50.640
urine.
So we should,
I think that is something we should bring back.

1724
01:40:50.820 --> 01:40:53.040
I think you have the power to bring that back.
Well you know what,

1725
01:40:53.200 --> 01:40:56.010
if there's Tarot card readers went up his profits.
Yeah,

1726
01:40:56.350 --> 01:41:00.830
piss profits are basing it on something
that divination.

1727
01:41:00.840 --> 01:41:04.610
But I know there's so many images of the doctor holding the flask and you know,

1728
01:41:05.110 --> 01:41:07.690
obviously like the color of your urine could be an indicator of health.

1729
01:41:07.690 --> 01:41:10.600
It still is today.
And look at the guy,
he's like,
what do you think?
Dark?

1730
01:41:12.380 --> 01:41:15.700
He looks like he's very,
very worried.
Yeah.
That's profits in La.

1731
01:41:17.050 --> 01:41:20.140
Most police during open up this door right now.
Look at them.

1732
01:41:20.160 --> 01:41:22.900
The bandaid around the guy's head.
Yeah.
Like he's hurting.

1733
01:41:23.540 --> 01:41:27.330
You guys got a head injury and the doctors check in this next image.

1734
01:41:27.550 --> 01:41:29.740
What's going on there?
I think he's pulling a tooth.

1735
01:41:29.741 --> 01:41:34.741
You know Christ the barbers when they pulled teeth that sometimes they would

1736
01:41:34.961 --> 01:41:39.670
have a drum in the shop and it would get louder as they got closer to point the

1737
01:41:39.671 --> 01:41:44.170
teeth,
which would make me more anxious.
And the barber shop was,

1738
01:41:44.260 --> 01:41:47.800
was a male domain because you'd also get advice on sexual diseases.

1739
01:41:47.801 --> 01:41:48.634
Cause of course,

1740
01:41:50.270 --> 01:41:53.470
so this is a fake nose.

1741
01:41:53.500 --> 01:41:57.950
So everybody's sort of lost their noses.
They lose loser.
No.

1742
01:41:58.570 --> 01:42:00.220
Okay.
So something you probably don't,

1743
01:42:02.110 --> 01:42:04.750
you probably don't know about syphilis.
I don't know if we have that image of,

1744
01:42:05.550 --> 01:42:08.830
of syphilis that I sent poor Jamie.

1745
01:42:08.831 --> 01:42:11.530
I told him your bookie manager,
Matt stags,

1746
01:42:11.531 --> 01:42:14.690
I said send these images to Jamie and don't tell them any contacts.
You know,

1747
01:42:14.710 --> 01:42:19.080
what the hell is this podcast be on
today?

1748
01:42:19.090 --> 01:42:24.090
Lost her nose is so syphilis attack sort of the soft tissue and the image that I

1749
01:42:24.221 --> 01:42:27.740
sent through,
which we'll show in a minute on the guy has um,

1750
01:42:27.880 --> 01:42:30.040
holds in his scalp as well.

1751
01:42:30.880 --> 01:42:34.570
That's a photograph that is a photograph in the 19th century.
So he actually,

1752
01:42:35.330 --> 01:42:39.010
he held onto his nose though,
so you could just cover that with a hat.

1753
01:42:40.920 --> 01:42:43.120
But it was,
it was incredibly painful and you,

1754
01:42:43.480 --> 01:42:48.390
Al Capone had syphilis and so you lost your mind.
It attacked the soft tissues,

1755
01:42:48.450 --> 01:42:51.340
technical brain.
It was really,
so people today,
you know,

1756
01:42:51.341 --> 01:42:54.070
I'll show these images on my Instagram or Twitter and people be like,
wow,

1757
01:42:54.071 --> 01:42:57.310
I didn't know syphilis was so bad.
It's like people die from it all the time.

1758
01:42:58.100 --> 01:43:01.670
Is also responsible for powdered wigs.
No,

1759
01:43:02.650 --> 01:43:07.360
no.
Yeah.
You got something,
I forget.

1760
01:43:07.870 --> 01:43:12.870
Some noble person got syphilis and started wearing a wig and when they started

1761
01:43:13.601 --> 01:43:14.231
wearing wigs,

1762
01:43:14.231 --> 01:43:17.560
other people started emulating them because they were the celebrities of the

1763
01:43:17.561 --> 01:43:21.160
kingdom.
I feel like this is a drunk history is real.
It's legitimate.

1764
01:43:21.550 --> 01:43:23.740
And the more wealthy you were like,

1765
01:43:23.741 --> 01:43:28.030
cause he's syphilis makes your hair fall out as well,
your teeth fall out.

1766
01:43:28.480 --> 01:43:31.360
And so the more wealthy you were,

1767
01:43:31.390 --> 01:43:34.300
the bigger and taller your wig would be.

1768
01:43:34.510 --> 01:43:38.660
That is where the term big wigs comes from.
That's interesting.

1769
01:43:38.800 --> 01:43:42.360
I mean I knew that in the 18th century that the wigs were getting bigger as the

1770
01:43:42.370 --> 01:43:45.000
fashions.
In fact,
um,
uh,

1771
01:43:45.100 --> 01:43:49.480
my husband illustrated book called the gin link is that it's sort of like an

1772
01:43:49.481 --> 01:43:52.040
18th century newspaper.
And as the newspaper on moves on,

1773
01:43:52.190 --> 01:43:56.390
the women would have to sit at the bottom of the carriage because their wigs

1774
01:43:56.391 --> 01:43:58.340
were so high in some cases.

1775
01:43:59.450 --> 01:44:03.410
But the women had syphilis.
Oh my gosh.
Yeah,
absolutely.

1776
01:44:03.420 --> 01:44:06.650
Because it would be passed on or so that's probably why they had wigs as well.

1777
01:44:06.680 --> 01:44:09.650
Yeah.
And I'm with syphilis,
you know,

1778
01:44:09.651 --> 01:44:13.490
your nose fell off and it was so prevalent in the 19th century that they had no

1779
01:44:13.491 --> 01:44:17.180
nose clubs.
So people would get together.
Yeah.
And they would,

1780
01:44:17.210 --> 01:44:21.530
in London they would share the fact that,
you know,
we,
yeah,
we lost her nose.

1781
01:44:21.531 --> 01:44:24.500
We have simply couldn't smell anything either.
No,
I mean it was awful.

1782
01:44:24.620 --> 01:44:27.920
And actually one of the ways that they treated syphilis was through mercury,

1783
01:44:27.921 --> 01:44:31.500
which is very cool.
And so when you talk about the loss,

1784
01:44:31.520 --> 01:44:34.770
those club writers,
and I don't know if that's the no,
no,
it was closed.

1785
01:44:35.090 --> 01:44:37.990
<v 0>Yeah,
they might,
they might have STDs though.
Says yeah,</v>

1786
01:44:38.960 --> 01:44:41.540
I'll just stand there with top out's and underwear.
Um,

1787
01:44:41.570 --> 01:44:44.120
pull up the thing though about big wigs.
Oh,
so it can,
uh,

1788
01:44:44.530 --> 01:44:48.370
<v 3>oh,
do you see,
do you see that one right up there?
Oh,
oh yeah,
that's fine.</v>

1789
01:44:48.940 --> 01:44:51.810
If you go up,
wait up Jamie and goats one.
Yes.

1790
01:44:51.830 --> 01:44:54.160
So that man didn't lose his notes as syphilis,

1791
01:44:54.161 --> 01:44:57.860
but that's an early form of a rhinoplasty that they,

1792
01:44:57.861 --> 01:45:01.420
that dates back to the renaissance and you'd have to stay in that position for

1793
01:45:01.421 --> 01:45:05.580
weeks.
While that grafted,
um,
I believe this man was,

1794
01:45:06.460 --> 01:45:09.150
<v 0>had a Sukkot of is for people just listing,</v>

1795
01:45:09.180 --> 01:45:14.180
there's a slice off of his arm that's connected to his nose and they have taped

1796
01:45:14.580 --> 01:45:17.880
and strapped his arm to hit the top of his head.

1797
01:45:18.030 --> 01:45:20.070
So he's stay in this position while his,

1798
01:45:20.550 --> 01:45:25.020
the chunk of his arm grows into his face and then they're going to cut it and

1799
01:45:25.021 --> 01:45:27.300
remove it.
When it develops its own blood supply.

1800
01:45:27.970 --> 01:45:32.080
<v 3>It's like,
it's like the nick,
if people have watched that show nick on,</v>

1801
01:45:32.081 --> 01:45:34.120
they have a scene with this.
So yeah,

1802
01:45:34.121 --> 01:45:38.680
it was so uncomfortable on the better off of no nos.
Yeah,

1803
01:45:38.681 --> 01:45:42.820
you might be better off and mercury of course you would lose your teeth and it

1804
01:45:42.821 --> 01:45:45.220
just really awful kinds of things they did was took your work.

1805
01:45:45.720 --> 01:45:48.210
And how long did that last for the mercury thing?
Ah,

1806
01:45:48.670 --> 01:45:50.200
all the way into the 19th century.

1807
01:45:50.260 --> 01:45:53.680
And so there's a phrase for a bunch of people died when they go,
hey guys,

1808
01:45:53.681 --> 01:45:55.690
this paper you're still copying.
You know what I mean?

1809
01:45:56.760 --> 01:45:59.130
<v 0>Yeah.
Okay.
Syphilis hidden between powder whey,</v>

1810
01:45:59.140 --> 01:46:03.060
syphilis epidemic and 15 hundreds year of left people with patchy hair loss.
Um,

1811
01:46:03.070 --> 01:46:07.500
gold go to the actual,
um,
the,
the,
who is it?
What,

1812
01:46:07.860 --> 01:46:10.890
what?
Yeah.
So these nobleman,
they're all gross,

1813
01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:15.840
disgusting people with STDs.
But what is the name of the guy?
Oh,
hold on.

1814
01:46:15.870 --> 01:46:19.740
Don't scroll.
Go back up here.
Yeah.
Okay.
There it is.
Oh,

1815
01:46:19.741 --> 01:46:23.290
Louis the Fort Louis the 14th only 17 his mom started thinking worth baldest

1816
01:46:23.300 --> 01:46:24.300
might hurt his reputation.

1817
01:46:24.301 --> 01:46:28.740
Louie hired 48 wig makers to save as image five years later,
King.
So,

1818
01:46:28.890 --> 01:46:30.480
but if you scroll down,

1819
01:46:30.570 --> 01:46:33.750
they didn't likely had syphilis boltman likelihood syphilis.

1820
01:46:33.930 --> 01:46:37.590
So this is what started it all out.
No,
it's interesting.
Yeah.

1821
01:46:37.680 --> 01:46:39.070
<v 3>That's hideous to like.</v>

1822
01:46:39.240 --> 01:46:43.200
Well there was some modern sensibilities like that just looks so bizarre.

1823
01:46:43.310 --> 01:46:47.810
<v 0>Well,
Natalie,
yeah,
I mean everything's gross,
right?
No one's washing themselves.</v>

1824
01:46:48.230 --> 01:46:49.560
They don't know what germs are.

1825
01:46:50.090 --> 01:46:52.110
<v 3>Still forced to watch a Hollywood movie.
They're like,
oh,</v>

1826
01:46:52.111 --> 01:46:55.710
it'd be so beautiful delivering the pet now.
We're such assholes with that is,

1827
01:46:55.711 --> 01:46:59.160
it drives me crazy when people want to pretend romanticize that it was so
lovely.

1828
01:46:59.161 --> 01:47:01.950
There are terrible things about life today.
There absolutely are.

1829
01:47:01.951 --> 01:47:04.560
But this is the best time to be alive ever by far.

1830
01:47:04.640 --> 01:47:07.970
<v 2>Yeah.
People say on,
is this the best time medically?
And it's like,
well,</v>

1831
01:47:07.971 --> 01:47:10.700
hopefully that's always true.
Right.
You hopefully tomorrow is.

1832
01:47:10.701 --> 01:47:12.440
That is better than,
you know,
hopefully we're,

1833
01:47:12.441 --> 01:47:16.640
we're advancing and learning more and everything.
I mean,
I think that,
you know,

1834
01:47:16.820 --> 01:47:20.810
we shouldn't look at a science and medicine is totally linear like that.

1835
01:47:20.811 --> 01:47:24.380
We're progressing towards something but that,
you know,

1836
01:47:24.980 --> 01:47:25.820
obviously we're,

1837
01:47:25.821 --> 01:47:29.990
we're learning from what doesn't work and that's why I said failure is a huge

1838
01:47:29.991 --> 01:47:33.380
part of what I love to talk about and on Youtube and stuff because we just don't

1839
01:47:33.381 --> 01:47:37.460
talk about it enough in life and science and medicine and all the things that

1840
01:47:37.461 --> 01:47:40.940
fail and um,
help us get to where we are today.

1841
01:47:41.310 --> 01:47:42.900
