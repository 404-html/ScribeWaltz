<v Speaker 1>Trey,</v>

2
00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.720
<v Speaker 1>my daddy Joe Rogan podcast by night all day.</v>

3
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:04.500
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:05.640
<v Speaker 1>at all tribes,</v>

5
00:00:05.641 --> 00:00:06.480
<v Speaker 1>the nature of tribes,</v>

6
00:00:06.481 --> 00:00:09.300
<v Speaker 1>you tell something that makes your tribe look like the good guys.</v>

7
00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.720
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

8
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:09.991
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

9
00:00:09.991 --> 00:00:11.250
<v Speaker 1>So each tribe has,</v>

10
00:00:11.251 --> 00:00:11.581
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

11
00:00:11.581 --> 00:00:13.020
<v Speaker 1>that's the conservative story.</v>

12
00:00:13.021 --> 00:00:17.310
<v Speaker 1>And then the liberal story is like we're fighting racism and sexism.</v>

13
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.360
<v Speaker 1>Did you see the Golden Globes?</v>

14
00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:18.591
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

15
00:00:18.591 --> 00:00:19.560
<v Speaker 1>I did see the Golden,</v>

16
00:00:19.561 --> 00:00:20.580
<v Speaker 1>did you see the Meryl Streep's?</v>

17
00:00:20.581 --> 00:00:22.280
<v Speaker 1>We did see the Meryl Streep's speech.</v>

18
00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.250
<v Speaker 1>God bless her.</v>

19
00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:24.480
<v Speaker 1>God bless marrow.</v>

20
00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:25.860
<v Speaker 1>What'd she was talking about?</v>

21
00:00:25.861 --> 00:00:27.630
<v Speaker 1>Mixed martial arts people got so mad.</v>

22
00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:29.011
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

23
00:00:29.011 --> 00:00:32.790
<v Speaker 1>of course she doesn't watch cage fighter when she's talking out of her ass for</v>

24
00:00:32.791 --> 00:00:33.121
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

25
00:00:33.121 --> 00:00:33.500
<v Speaker 1>But she,</v>

26
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.300
<v Speaker 1>you know to say that some people aren't artists,</v>

27
00:00:36.301 --> 00:00:37.440
<v Speaker 1>martial artists aren't artists.</v>

28
00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.680
<v Speaker 1>Well that's completely open to interpretation.</v>

29
00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:42.040
<v Speaker 1>Like what do you think is beautiful?</v>

30
00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.090
<v Speaker 1>You think that fucking stupid movie when you played that Rockstar,</v>

31
00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:46.860
<v Speaker 1>what was that one that nobody went to see him?</v>

32
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.170
<v Speaker 1>Ricky get your gun or whatever the fuck that is.</v>

33
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.520
<v Speaker 1>Listen that wasn't art.</v>

34
00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.960
<v Speaker 1>An art and Anderson Silva Front kick to the face is a thousand times more</v>

35
00:00:54.961 --> 00:00:55.860
<v Speaker 1>beautiful than that piece.</v>

36
00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:57.420
<v Speaker 1>Shit movie put out lady.</v>

37
00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:59.430
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

38
00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure she's a very nice person.</v>

39
00:01:00.871 --> 00:01:02.400
<v Speaker 1>She probably thinks that she's,</v>

40
00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.530
<v Speaker 1>she's standing up for what's right.</v>

41
00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:05.970
<v Speaker 1>Get ready for Ricky.</v>

42
00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:07.680
<v Speaker 1>Ricky Flash.</v>

43
00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:08.850
<v Speaker 1>Get the fuck out of here.</v>

44
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.430
<v Speaker 1>Three people saw that movie and they're all related to her.</v>

45
00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:13.740
<v Speaker 1>Nobody saw that movie.</v>

46
00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.770
<v Speaker 1>Did you see that movie even heard of what the,</v>

47
00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:16.440
<v Speaker 1>it was like,</v>

48
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:17.280
<v Speaker 1>what are they doing?</v>

49
00:01:17.281 --> 00:01:18.350
<v Speaker 1>She's an 80 year old lady.</v>

50
00:01:18.351 --> 00:01:19.340
<v Speaker 1>She's going to be a rockstar.</v>

51
00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:20.610
<v Speaker 1>Ricky's coming back and,</v>

52
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.220
<v Speaker 1>but it's also like such weird casting for her too.</v>

53
00:01:23.221 --> 00:01:26.490
<v Speaker 1>Cause like she does like these emotionally difficult like Sophie's choice</v>

54
00:01:26.491 --> 00:01:26.941
<v Speaker 1>movies.</v>

55
00:01:26.941 --> 00:01:29.640
<v Speaker 1>And then she's like trying to do like a poppy rock star movie.</v>

56
00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.020
<v Speaker 1>Well she was interested in it.</v>

57
00:01:31.021 --> 00:01:31.261
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

58
00:01:31.261 --> 00:01:33.240
<v Speaker 1>she's an amazing actress.</v>

59
00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.790
<v Speaker 1>She's an amazing artist in her realm.</v>

60
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.350
<v Speaker 1>And I just think it's the,</v>

61
00:01:37.351 --> 00:01:37.920
<v Speaker 1>you could,</v>

62
00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.920
<v Speaker 1>you could sort of say that without disparaging what other people enjoy and</v>

63
00:01:43.321 --> 00:01:46.920
<v Speaker 1>including disparaging what a lot of women in joy and foreigners.</v>

64
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.250
<v Speaker 1>One of the things you were saying is that Hollywood is crawling with foreigners.</v>

65
00:01:50.251 --> 00:01:51.240
<v Speaker 1>If you take them out,</v>

66
00:01:51.241 --> 00:01:54.540
<v Speaker 1>all you have left is MMA and football and MMA.</v>

67
00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.010
<v Speaker 1>Mixed martial arts is not the arts.</v>

68
00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.420
<v Speaker 1>But you wouldn't,</v>

69
00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.020
<v Speaker 1>that's not true because like 80% of the fighters in the UFC or from other</v>

70
00:02:01.021 --> 00:02:01.854
<v Speaker 1>countries,</v>

71
00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.050
<v Speaker 1>they're from Ireland.</v>

72
00:02:03.051 --> 00:02:04.260
<v Speaker 1>Like Conor Mcgregor,</v>

73
00:02:04.261 --> 00:02:05.550
<v Speaker 1>they're from Brazil,</v>

74
00:02:05.551 --> 00:02:06.450
<v Speaker 1>like Amanda Nunez.</v>

75
00:02:06.451 --> 00:02:07.840
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is the good,</v>

76
00:02:07.841 --> 00:02:11.100
<v Speaker 1>incredibly diverse lineup of people from all over the world.</v>

77
00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.350
<v Speaker 1>So for her to say that as like so silly,</v>

78
00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.961
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

79
00:02:13.961 --> 00:02:17.310
<v Speaker 1>I can understand saying that you don't think it's an art by your interpretation.</v>

80
00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:18.810
<v Speaker 1>I understand that.</v>

81
00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.240
<v Speaker 1>But the larger point is that humans are silly.</v>

82
00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.230
<v Speaker 1>Humans in general are silly and we're not individually.</v>

83
00:02:25.231 --> 00:02:26.064
<v Speaker 1>That's smart.</v>

84
00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:27.690
<v Speaker 1>I think performance arts,</v>

85
00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.280
<v Speaker 1>like as far as dance,</v>

86
00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.530
<v Speaker 1>I mean their dance is clearly an art,</v>

87
00:02:31.531 --> 00:02:31.741
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

88
00:02:31.741 --> 00:02:33.240
<v Speaker 1>If you watch Mikhail Baryshnikov,</v>

89
00:02:33.241 --> 00:02:34.290
<v Speaker 1>that's clearly art.</v>

90
00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.520
<v Speaker 1>And I think in many ways competition in performance,</v>

91
00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.980
<v Speaker 1>like gymnastics is also an art.</v>

92
00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:42.210
<v Speaker 1>We don't think of it as an art.</v>

93
00:02:42.211 --> 00:02:43.200
<v Speaker 1>We think of it as a sport.</v>

94
00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.030
<v Speaker 1>But when you look at the ability to execute these spectacular moves,</v>

95
00:02:48.031 --> 00:02:48.360
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

96
00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.880
<v Speaker 1>maybe that doing it to a concerto,</v>

97
00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:52.680
<v Speaker 1>but it's still art.</v>

98
00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:53.050
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

99
00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.430
<v Speaker 1>like you,</v>

100
00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.170
<v Speaker 1>you see some amazing gymnast fly through the air and nail a landing.</v>

101
00:02:58.171 --> 00:02:59.010
<v Speaker 1>It's beautiful.</v>

102
00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.801
<v Speaker 1>It's glorious.</v>

103
00:02:59.801 --> 00:03:01.720
<v Speaker 1>Well that's art in competition,</v>

104
00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:04.120
<v Speaker 1>but it's not one on one competition.</v>

105
00:03:04.121 --> 00:03:08.980
<v Speaker 1>Now art in one on one competition is Edson Barboza wheel kicking Terry Edem.</v>

106
00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.170
<v Speaker 1>I know it doesn't look like art to some people,</v>

107
00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.340
<v Speaker 1>but to me it does well and it's a technically extremely difficult move.</v>

108
00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.220
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot of time to practice and get good at.</v>

109
00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.360
<v Speaker 1>So it's just the fact that when he does his beautiful pair of flat,</v>

110
00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:23.950
<v Speaker 1>it just lands in someone's face.</v>

111
00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:24.191
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

112
00:03:24.191 --> 00:03:28.630
<v Speaker 1>someone has to suffer and because someone has to suffer and perhaps sometimes</v>

113
00:03:28.631 --> 00:03:31.210
<v Speaker 1>both people have to suffer in the in,</v>

114
00:03:31.211 --> 00:03:31.961
<v Speaker 1>in terms of,</v>

115
00:03:31.961 --> 00:03:32.794
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

116
00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:33.880
<v Speaker 1>a very brutal fight.</v>

117
00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:34.210
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

118
00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.751
<v Speaker 1>But if you look at,</v>

119
00:03:34.751 --> 00:03:38.680
<v Speaker 1>like Amanda Nunez is knock out of Ronda Rousey's if you're an Amanda Nunez Fan,</v>

120
00:03:38.681 --> 00:03:40.300
<v Speaker 1>that is a beautiful work of art.</v>

121
00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

122
00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:43.720
<v Speaker 1>Cause she didn't get any promotion for that fight.</v>

123
00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.710
<v Speaker 1>She was looked at like cannon fodder to go in there and fight rousy.</v>

124
00:03:47.711 --> 00:03:50.680
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people were predicting a first round victory and she went out there and</v>

125
00:03:50.681 --> 00:03:52.300
<v Speaker 1>fucked her up in 48 seconds.</v>

126
00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.820
<v Speaker 1>Art Tool to some people,</v>

127
00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:56.560
<v Speaker 1>it might not be to her,</v>

128
00:03:56.561 --> 00:03:57.394
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

129
00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.910
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>
