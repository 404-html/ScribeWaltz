1
00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:04.790
<v Speaker 1>The general good experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so</v>

2
00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.580
<v Speaker 2>for you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you had this traumatic experience of</v>

3
00:00:08.581 --> 00:00:11.580
<v Speaker 2>violence when you were young,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were depressed,</v>

4
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.060
<v Speaker 2>you were trying to figure out what the</v>
<v Speaker 2>source of this was,</v>

5
00:00:15.061 --> 00:00:17.400
<v Speaker 2>whether it was some sort of a chemical</v>
<v Speaker 2>imbalance in your brain.</v>

6
00:00:17.401 --> 00:00:21.210
<v Speaker 2>Now when they say chemical imbalances in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the brain have,</v>

7
00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.140
<v Speaker 2>are they capable of measuring the level</v>
<v Speaker 2>of Serotonin in your brain?</v>

8
00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:26.980
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's a huge debate about this.</v>

9
00:00:26.981 --> 00:00:27.840
<v Speaker 1>She couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

10
00:00:27.841 --> 00:00:30.930
<v Speaker 1>do autopsies and there's a big debate</v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

11
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.480
<v Speaker 1>but that's when someone's dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

12
00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.820
<v Speaker 1>but there's a big debate about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there seems to be most scientists</v>

13
00:00:35.821 --> 00:00:37.710
<v Speaker 1>agree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not all of them,</v>

14
00:00:37.711 --> 00:00:39.180
<v Speaker 1>and there are some people who dissent</v>
<v Speaker 1>from this,</v>

15
00:00:39.181 --> 00:00:42.810
<v Speaker 1>but most scientists agree low serotonin</v>
<v Speaker 1>correlates with depression,</v>

16
00:00:42.811 --> 00:00:43.860
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's not the same thing in the same</v>

17
00:00:43.861 --> 00:00:45.870
<v Speaker 1>way stretch marks correlate with</v>
<v Speaker 1>obesity,</v>

18
00:00:45.871 --> 00:00:47.960
<v Speaker 1>but they're not the cause of obesity is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the product to them?</v>

19
00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.130
<v Speaker 1>So there are real brain changes that</v>
<v Speaker 1>happen,</v>

20
00:00:50.131 --> 00:00:52.380
<v Speaker 1>which I write about in Los Connections</v>
<v Speaker 1>and important to say that,</v>

21
00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.380
<v Speaker 1>that I don't think they should be</v>
<v Speaker 1>described as chemical imbalances,</v>

22
00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:56.970
<v Speaker 1>but one of these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was really shocking to me,</v>

23
00:00:56.971 --> 00:00:58.770
<v Speaker 1>was one of the British experts and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>stopped to.</v>

24
00:00:58.771 --> 00:01:02.280
<v Speaker 1>David Healey said to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can't even say the sorry,</v>

25
00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.950
<v Speaker 1>the idea that depression causes serotide</v>
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>

26
00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.960
<v Speaker 1>You can't even say that that theory is</v>
<v Speaker 1>discredited because it was never</v>

27
00:01:09.961 --> 00:01:12.330
<v Speaker 1>credited.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was never a time when half of the</v>

28
00:01:12.331 --> 00:01:14.100
<v Speaker 1>scientists in the field believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

29
00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.060
<v Speaker 1>The reason that story got sold to me and</v>
<v Speaker 1>most people listening to this in the</v>

30
00:01:18.061 --> 00:01:20.370
<v Speaker 1>nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's because it worked really well for</v>

31
00:01:20.371 --> 00:01:21.510
<v Speaker 1>the drug companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

32
00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:23.790
<v Speaker 1>Because what it makes it sound like if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've just got a chemical imbalance,</v>

33
00:01:23.791 --> 00:01:25.590
<v Speaker 1>the solution is just to give you</v>
<v Speaker 1>chemicals.</v>

34
00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.410
<v Speaker 1>And that's important to say chemical</v>
<v Speaker 1>antidepressants do play a role.</v>

35
00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.680
<v Speaker 1>We can measure that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's a slightly nuanced point to</v>

36
00:01:31.681 --> 00:01:32.850
<v Speaker 1>make about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is.</v>

37
00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.280
<v Speaker 1>So depression is measured by something</v>
<v Speaker 1>called the Hamilton.</v>

38
00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:36.900
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've always felt sorry for whoever</v>

39
00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:39.690
<v Speaker 1>Hamilton was that the only way we</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember him is by how fucking miserable</v>

40
00:01:39.691 --> 00:01:40.500
<v Speaker 1>we all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But anyway,</v>

41
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.230
<v Speaker 1>so how is the scale goes from one where</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are,</v>

42
00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dancing around in ecstasy,</v>

43
00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:46.330
<v Speaker 1>ecstasy.</v>

44
00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.200
<v Speaker 1>It's a 51 when you would be acutely</v>
<v Speaker 1>suicidal.</v>

45
00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:51.600
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to give you a sense of what movement</v>

46
00:01:51.601 --> 00:01:55.080
<v Speaker 1>on the Hamilton scale looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you move six points on the Hamilton</v>

47
00:01:55.081 --> 00:01:55.980
<v Speaker 1>scale,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>

48
00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.430
<v Speaker 1>If your sleep patterns get better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll gain six points on the Hamilton</v>

49
00:01:59.431 --> 00:02:01.370
<v Speaker 1>scale and if your sleep patterns</v>
<v Speaker 1>deteriorate.</v>

50
00:02:01.371 --> 00:02:03.210
<v Speaker 1>So you have a baby who's crying all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

51
00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.850
<v Speaker 1>you're generally lose six points on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hamilton scale,</v>

52
00:02:05.851 --> 00:02:08.130
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So professor Irving Kirsch at Harvard</v>

53
00:02:08.131 --> 00:02:10.020
<v Speaker 1>medical school to the best research on</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

54
00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:14.790
<v Speaker 1>and what he found is on average chemical</v>
<v Speaker 1>antidepressants move people one point</v>

55
00:02:14.791 --> 00:02:16.830
<v Speaker 1>eight points on the Hamilton scale,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

56
00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.010
<v Speaker 1>about a third of what improving your</v>
<v Speaker 1>sleep patterns does.</v>

57
00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.100
<v Speaker 1>It's important to say that's an average.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So some people do get more than that.</v>

58
00:02:23.101 --> 00:02:27.180
<v Speaker 1>Some people get less and you can say one</v>
<v Speaker 1>point eight points is not nothing,</v>

59
00:02:27.181 --> 00:02:28.440
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're acutely suicidal,</v>

60
00:02:28.441 --> 00:02:30.030
<v Speaker 1>one point eight points can take the edge</v>
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>

61
00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.280
<v Speaker 1>There's real value in giving people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>relief,</v>

62
00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.740
<v Speaker 1>but it's not solving the problem for</v>
<v Speaker 1>most people.</v>

63
00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.480
<v Speaker 1>I thought I was weird for being on</v>
<v Speaker 1>antidepressants for so long and</v>

64
00:02:39.481 --> 00:02:42.830
<v Speaker 1>remaining depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Turns out I was totally typical concert.</v>

65
00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.900
<v Speaker 1>Dr Steve [inaudible] is professor of</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychology,</v>

66
00:02:45.901 --> 00:02:49.410
<v Speaker 1>has done a lot of work on this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Between 65 and 80 percent of people</v>

67
00:02:49.411 --> 00:02:51.120
<v Speaker 1>taking chemical entity precedence become</v>
<v Speaker 1>depressed.</v>

68
00:02:51.121 --> 00:02:51.954
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

69
00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.160
<v Speaker 2>this is a guy who is a real Bernie</v>
<v Speaker 2>sanders supporter,</v>

70
00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.380
<v Speaker 2>open Bernie Sanders supporter who worked</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the DNC.</v>

71
00:02:57.381 --> 00:03:01.870
<v Speaker 2>The DNC absolutely rigged the primary</v>
<v Speaker 2>against Bernie Sanders.</v>

72
00:03:01.871 --> 00:03:04.120
<v Speaker 2>He was aware of this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was there while this was all going</v>

73
00:03:04.121 --> 00:03:05.620
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So is Donna Brazil.</v>

74
00:03:05.621 --> 00:03:08.890
<v Speaker 2>Everyone was aware of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The guy got fucking murdered after he</v>

75
00:03:08.891 --> 00:03:11.500
<v Speaker 2>leaked information to wikileaks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you don't think that's a little</v>

76
00:03:11.501 --> 00:03:13.360
<v Speaker 2>weird,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you looking at?</v>

77
00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:14.230
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

78
00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.290
<v Speaker 2>What delusional rose colored glasses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you looking at your party from a.</v>

79
00:03:18.291 --> 00:03:21.040
<v Speaker 2>You think you're in some Julia Roberts</v>
<v Speaker 2>movie from Nineteen Ninety.</v>

80
00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.740
<v Speaker 2>This is real shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some guy got killed.</v>

81
00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.300
<v Speaker 2>He was 24 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was a young guy who was very</v>

82
00:03:28.301 --> 00:03:33.301
<v Speaker 2>optimistic and have this view of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world where he means the guy fucking</v>

83
00:03:34.691 --> 00:03:37.360
<v Speaker 2>war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>American flag pants and shirt.</v>

84
00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:41.920
<v Speaker 2>There's a famous picture of him with a</v>
<v Speaker 2>beer on Misa patriot that a lot of ways</v>

85
00:03:41.921 --> 00:03:44.050
<v Speaker 2>he wanted to be involved in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>political process.</v>

86
00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.300
<v Speaker 2>He was very idealistic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is he was probably shattered by finding</v>

87
00:03:49.301 --> 00:03:53.320
<v Speaker 2>out to the party that he was working for</v>
<v Speaker 2>was corrupting the democratic process.</v>

88
00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:56.590
<v Speaker 2>And because I've said this before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

89
00:03:56.591 --> 00:04:00.850
<v Speaker 2>I've been accused of helping Donald</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trump win by really wacky people online.</v>

90
00:04:00.851 --> 00:04:02.830
<v Speaker 2>They're like pointing out all the flaws</v>
<v Speaker 2>of Hillary Clinton.</v>

91
00:04:02.831 --> 00:04:03.341
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

92
00:04:03.341 --> 00:04:05.710
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't ignore that shit because you</v>

93
00:04:05.711 --> 00:04:09.490
<v Speaker 2>want one side to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I've talked about all of his flaws</v>

94
00:04:09.491 --> 00:04:12.200
<v Speaker 2>to it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of flawed human beings are</v>

95
00:04:12.201 --> 00:04:13.900
<v Speaker 2>run for president.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pretty much all of them.</v>

96
00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:15.250
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very rare.</v>

97
00:04:15.251 --> 00:04:16.840
<v Speaker 2>We have someone's not flawed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

98
00:04:16.841 --> 00:04:18.670
<v Speaker 2>Extremely flawed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're all flawed,</v>

99
00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:21.490
<v Speaker 2>but extremely flawed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who wants to be the fucking King of the</v>

100
00:04:21.491 --> 00:04:22.540
<v Speaker 2>world?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very rare.</v>

101
00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:23.790
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

102
00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.390
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not to change subjects,</v>

103
00:04:26.391 --> 00:04:28.760
<v Speaker 3>but Barack Obama,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone thinks is the greatest guy in</v>

104
00:04:28.761 --> 00:04:29.594
<v Speaker 3>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you know,</v>

105
00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.750
<v Speaker 3>in contrast to Donald Trump?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because he was polite,</v>

106
00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.030
<v Speaker 3>he was a statesman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was a good speaker website.</v>

107
00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.520
<v Speaker 3>But at the end when he was polite at the</v>
<v Speaker 3>same time,</v>

108
00:04:37.521 --> 00:04:40.880
<v Speaker 3>he let cops correct the heads of</v>
<v Speaker 3>peaceful protesters at occupy Wall</v>

109
00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.670
<v Speaker 3>Street all across the country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>said he put on a soft shoe to stand up</v>

110
00:04:43.671 --> 00:04:46.100
<v Speaker 3>for unions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He fucked over unions in Wisconsin when</v>

111
00:04:46.101 --> 00:04:48.080
<v Speaker 3>they took the teacher's union a way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

112
00:04:48.081 --> 00:04:51.210
<v Speaker 3>he opened the Arctic to drilling twice</v>
<v Speaker 3>whenever shell oil wanted.</v>

113
00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:52.063
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

114
00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:54.470
<v Speaker 3>And he only closed it when they didn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>want to do it anymore.</v>

115
00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.280
<v Speaker 3>He took us from two wars to seven.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He cooked out five point 1 million</v>

116
00:04:58.281 --> 00:05:00.830
<v Speaker 3>families out of their homes instead of</v>
<v Speaker 3>helping them.</v>

117
00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:04.010
<v Speaker 3>And he made Wall Street whole while</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking over everybody else.</v>

118
00:05:04.011 --> 00:05:05.870
<v Speaker 3>So this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he ended,</v>

119
00:05:05.871 --> 00:05:08.820
<v Speaker 3>he made the Bush tax cuts permanent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there was a,</v>

120
00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:09.950
<v Speaker 3>what they say is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

121
00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:13.010
<v Speaker 3>it looked like it was changed on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>outside continuity on the inside,</v>

122
00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:16.080
<v Speaker 2>just completely through the windshield.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a negative way.</v>

123
00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:18.620
<v Speaker 2>Is this the flat Earth Guy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

124
00:05:18.621 --> 00:05:22.180
<v Speaker 2>that guy is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's only raised $110 because we need to</v>

125
00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:23.690
<v Speaker 2>know math.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hold on.</v>

126
00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:27.740
<v Speaker 2>It's only $110 at a $10,000 goal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Listening flat earthers.</v>

127
00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:29.150
<v Speaker 2>You need to put your money where your</v>
<v Speaker 2>mouth is.</v>

128
00:05:29.151 --> 00:05:31.700
<v Speaker 2>I'm starting to believe that you don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>really believe in this cause.</v>

129
00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:33.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>send my boy Michael Hughes.</v>

130
00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:36.560
<v Speaker 2>$10,000 and you get your liver spotted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hands off.</v>

131
00:05:36.561 --> 00:05:41.561
<v Speaker 2>My mother had a couple of shots at him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He bailed on the fails,</v>

132
00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:44.210
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he's actually does.</v>

133
00:05:44.211 --> 00:05:47.570
<v Speaker 2>He launched himself into space yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they got the late a few times.</v>

134
00:05:47.571 --> 00:05:50.020
<v Speaker 2>The first time he's going to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then the government got involved and I</v>

135
00:05:50.021 --> 00:05:50.481
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

136
00:05:50.481 --> 00:05:52.920
<v Speaker 2>you can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Know that is such a crazy move.</v>

137
00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.120
<v Speaker 2>Rock doesn't fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He has $10,000.</v>

138
00:05:56.121 --> 00:05:58.250
<v Speaker 2>If Eddie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think there is fucking give this guy</v>

139
00:05:58.251 --> 00:05:59.420
<v Speaker 2>some money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what about that?</v>

140
00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:04.420
<v Speaker 2>Bob Character isn't even super wealthy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's funding a single forever because</v>

141
00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:07.220
<v Speaker 2>he's been too busy with flat earth</v>
<v Speaker 2>theory.</v>

142
00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:10.130
<v Speaker 2>Listen man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once he understands the fucking real</v>

143
00:06:10.131 --> 00:06:13.880
<v Speaker 2>true image of the earth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you have a wall that surrounds</v>

144
00:06:13.881 --> 00:06:16.580
<v Speaker 2>the outer realm of the earth and</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody thinks is worth is round.</v>

145
00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:20.470
<v Speaker 2>You got shit to tell the people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's more important than your rap song.</v>

146
00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:22.790
<v Speaker 2>You made things run.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to get people.</v>

147
00:06:22.791 --> 00:06:24.500
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at the guy from Brinkley to when</v>

148
00:06:24.501 --> 00:06:26.270
<v Speaker 2>it's moved on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he moved on.</v>

149
00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:28.850
<v Speaker 2>Y'All got to take this flat earth shit</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the next level.</v>

150
00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:34.510
<v Speaker 2>Fuck the flat versus round argument.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's talk more about the simulation and</v>

151
00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:38.930
<v Speaker 2>who's programming it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how both sides get benefit.</v>

152
00:06:38.931 --> 00:06:41.290
<v Speaker 2>If it's round or flat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my gosh is crazy.</v>

153
00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:44.180
<v Speaker 2>He's going through some shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's flatter stuff.</v>

154
00:06:44.181 --> 00:06:44.931
<v Speaker 2>What else can we tell?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

155
00:06:44.931 --> 00:06:47.240
<v Speaker 2>here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is something really important</v>

156
00:06:47.241 --> 00:06:48.530
<v Speaker 2>for anybody who's listening to this.</v>

157
00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:52.910
<v Speaker 2>You've got to not hang yourself on your</v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas.</v>

158
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.950
<v Speaker 2>I've done it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did in the past.</v>

159
00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:58.520
<v Speaker 2>When you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not really paying attention.</v>

160
00:06:58.521 --> 00:07:00.740
<v Speaker 2>You're only looking for things that</v>
<v Speaker 2>support your idea.</v>

161
00:07:00.741 --> 00:07:02.840
<v Speaker 2>It's called confirmation bias.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody,</v>

162
00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:06.160
<v Speaker 2>if everybody is susceptible to it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>me included,</v>

163
00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:08.060
<v Speaker 2>have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've done it 100 times to myself when</v>

164
00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:10.220
<v Speaker 2>the task,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but once you realize what it is,</v>

165
00:07:10.221 --> 00:07:11.870
<v Speaker 2>if you keep doing the same goddamn</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>

166
00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:16.130
<v Speaker 2>then you're being stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So once you know what it is and you know</v>

167
00:07:16.131 --> 00:07:16.940
<v Speaker 2>it's possible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll do.</v>

168
00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:20.240
<v Speaker 2>Let's just look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at all the overwhelming amount of</v>

169
00:07:20.241 --> 00:07:25.160
<v Speaker 2>evidence from super geniuses that say</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's around just you gotta walk away,</v>

170
00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:29.630
<v Speaker 2>it's it hurts you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It hurts your view of the world to</v>

171
00:07:29.631 --> 00:07:32.960
<v Speaker 2>believe that because you can't believe</v>
<v Speaker 2>it if you're really paying attention.</v>

172
00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:38.000
<v Speaker 2>So if you believe that what you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>saying is you have a very limited box in</v>

173
00:07:38.001 --> 00:07:39.470
<v Speaker 2>which you're willing to operate in.</v>

174
00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:42.950
<v Speaker 2>You're not willing to accept anything</v>
<v Speaker 2>outside of what you've already got as a</v>

175
00:07:42.951 --> 00:07:47.951
<v Speaker 2>preconceived idea and you're ignoring</v>
<v Speaker 2>massive amounts of data that points to</v>

176
00:07:48.051 --> 00:07:50.180
<v Speaker 2>the fact that you're wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So by doing that,</v>

177
00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:53.100
<v Speaker 2>you limit your own view of yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

178
00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:54.340
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you become you.</v>

179
00:07:54.341 --> 00:07:57.080
<v Speaker 2>You don't trust in the way you view</v>
<v Speaker 2>things anymore.</v>

180
00:07:57.081 --> 00:08:00.290
<v Speaker 2>Your box.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then it's very dangerous to be committed</v>

181
00:08:00.291 --> 00:08:03.530
<v Speaker 2>to something you know is not true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It also shows a level of diligence to</v>

182
00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:07.460
<v Speaker 2>because when you got these geniuses who</v>
<v Speaker 2>spent their entire lives doing doing</v>

183
00:08:07.461 --> 00:08:11.150
<v Speaker 2>this stuff and astrophysics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're telling me that third part of</v>

184
00:08:11.151 --> 00:08:15.170
<v Speaker 2>this scheme to and they believe that</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's 100 percent of the problem.</v>

185
00:08:15.171 --> 00:08:19.040
<v Speaker 2>One hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's adopting an idea too soon.</v>

186
00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:21.290
<v Speaker 2>That's 100 percent of the idea because</v>
<v Speaker 2>once you.</v>

187
00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:24.020
<v Speaker 2>Once you adopt that idea and then you</v>
<v Speaker 2>hang onto it,</v>

188
00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:25.910
<v Speaker 2>now you're fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like bigfoot.</v>

189
00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:27.860
<v Speaker 2>Bigfoot was a big one for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was.</v>

190
00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:32.060
<v Speaker 2>I was convinced it was real with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How long ago was this?</v>

191
00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:36.170
<v Speaker 2>A couple weeks when it</v>
<v Speaker 2>drops.</v>

192
00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:37.910
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's totally legit.</v>

193
00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:38.601
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

194
00:08:38.601 --> 00:08:40.700
<v Speaker 2>if you can get a guy into that position,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that shit will hurt.</v>

195
00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:42.950
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you get a guy like Gordon Ryan puts</v>

196
00:08:42.951 --> 00:08:44.480
<v Speaker 2>you in something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just for fun.</v>

197
00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:45.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll fuck your legs up,</v>

198
00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:48.770
<v Speaker 2>but here's a go back to it again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's a good position for a</v>

199
00:08:48.771 --> 00:08:51.620
<v Speaker 2>couple reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so like right there.</v>

200
00:08:51.621 --> 00:08:54.650
<v Speaker 2>It's good if you can get to that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you can get to that,</v>

201
00:08:54.651 --> 00:08:58.710
<v Speaker 2>but I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the catch dop in him.</v>

202
00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:02.970
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure what stopping him from</v>
<v Speaker 2>scooting his butt towards that guy's</v>

203
00:09:02.971 --> 00:09:06.720
<v Speaker 2>right leg.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the catch is that if you can roll</v>

204
00:09:06.721 --> 00:09:08.640
<v Speaker 2>over while you're in the figure four leg</v>
<v Speaker 2>lock,</v>

205
00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:11.580
<v Speaker 2>it completely reverses the polars of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

206
00:09:11.581 --> 00:09:12.930
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the,</v>

207
00:09:12.931 --> 00:09:15.480
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>earth pain of the pain.</v>

208
00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:18.960
<v Speaker 2>So then Rick flair with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

209
00:09:18.961 --> 00:09:19.980
<v Speaker 2>let me see it again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>

210
00:09:19.981 --> 00:09:22.800
<v Speaker 2>that's also true in real life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've tested that.</v>

211
00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:25.520
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I'm saying is like the position</v>

212
00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.280
<v Speaker 2>you would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a natural way to defend it that</v>

213
00:09:29.281 --> 00:09:30.690
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't seem like the guys defending</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

214
00:09:30.691 --> 00:09:32.620
<v Speaker 2>That's why like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look.</v>

215
00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:34.470
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's trying to keep them from putting it</v>

216
00:09:34.471 --> 00:09:34.891
<v Speaker 2>in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

217
00:09:34.891 --> 00:09:37.080
<v Speaker 2>he stepped on his dick because he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>stepping on his deck a little bit.</v>

218
00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:38.820
<v Speaker 2>That's the undertaker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're allowed to.</v>

219
00:09:38.821 --> 00:09:40.610
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a short legs down.</v>

220
00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:42.300
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a heel hook.</v>

221
00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:43.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

222
00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:44.670
<v Speaker 2>The guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the why.</v>

223
00:09:44.671 --> 00:09:47.580
<v Speaker 2>This is so fucking stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The guy who's getting his leg kranked is</v>

224
00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:49.710
<v Speaker 2>actually the guy who's in the best</v>
<v Speaker 2>position.</v>

225
00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:52.890
<v Speaker 2>He's in a heel hook position.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

226
00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:54.300
<v Speaker 2>If you could just grab his leg.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

227
00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:56.580
<v Speaker 2>So who's supposed to be getting hurt</v>
<v Speaker 2>here?</v>

228
00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.680
<v Speaker 2>This is actually the guy in black.</v>

229
00:09:58.740 --> 00:09:59.700
<v Speaker 2>The guy in black is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

230
00:09:59.701 --> 00:10:01.560
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The guy in the better position.</v>
