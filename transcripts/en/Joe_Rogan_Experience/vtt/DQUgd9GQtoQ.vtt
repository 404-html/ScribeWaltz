1
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.220
<v Speaker 1>Johann hari.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got it right.</v>

2
00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:10.320
<v Speaker 1>You said it right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are literally the first person to</v>

3
00:00:10.321 --> 00:00:11.660
<v Speaker 1>have the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was saint you fed that.</v>

4
00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.090
<v Speaker 1>I once waited for six hours with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>broken arm in an emergency room because</v>

5
00:00:15.091 --> 00:00:17.910
<v Speaker 1>they were calling for Joanna Harry to</v>
<v Speaker 1>come forward to anyone who gets my name</v>

6
00:00:17.911 --> 00:00:20.250
<v Speaker 1>better than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just assumed that was you when you</v>

7
00:00:20.251 --> 00:00:23.720
<v Speaker 1>hear you heard Joanna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could all but I was lying that light,</v>

8
00:00:23.721 --> 00:00:25.510
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We pig or be like Fox.</v>

9
00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:27.600
<v Speaker 1>I want to help me so they have to get my</v>
<v Speaker 1>normal mind.</v>

10
00:00:27.601 --> 00:00:29.760
<v Speaker 1>I would have done what went down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What went down with your arm.</v>

11
00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.790
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I fell and I tried to do nothing.</v>

12
00:00:32.791 --> 00:00:34.400
<v Speaker 1>No glamorous story too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I fell down a staircase.</v>

13
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.510
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't even drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't even fucked on anything.</v>

14
00:00:36.511 --> 00:00:38.040
<v Speaker 1>I just fell down the stairs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's right.</v>

15
00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:39.800
<v Speaker 1>It's Daniel wasn't even a victim of</v>
<v Speaker 1>domestic violence,</v>

16
00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:40.643
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like no,</v>

17
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.700
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

18
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.650
<v Speaker 1>surrounding narrative that we made that</v>
<v Speaker 1>an interesting story,</v>

19
00:00:43.651 --> 00:00:46.890
<v Speaker 1>sadly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So give me your,</v>

20
00:00:46.891 --> 00:00:51.891
<v Speaker 1>if you had like a one paragraph take on</v>
<v Speaker 1>depression,</v>

21
00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.390
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is your take on depression?</v>

22
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.120
<v Speaker 2>So this is why I wrote this book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lost connections and covering the real</v>

23
00:00:57.121 --> 00:00:59.240
<v Speaker 2>causes of depression and anxiety and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>real solutions.</v>

24
00:00:59.241 --> 00:01:03.300
<v Speaker 2>So</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to understand why does</v>

25
00:01:03.301 --> 00:01:04.710
<v Speaker 2>depression and anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is depression?</v>

26
00:01:04.711 --> 00:01:07.560
<v Speaker 2>Anxiety seems to be rising so much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very personal to me.</v>

27
00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.480
<v Speaker 2>When I was a teenager,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had gone to my doctor.</v>

28
00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:11.790
<v Speaker 2>I had explained that I was in this deep</v>
<v Speaker 2>sense of pain.</v>

29
00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.730
<v Speaker 2>And all my doctor did was telling me a</v>
<v Speaker 2>biological story just said,</v>

30
00:01:14.731 --> 00:01:17.760
<v Speaker 2>basically your brain's broken.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And all he did was give me drugs,</v>

31
00:01:17.761 --> 00:01:20.370
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And drugs play a role in treating</v>

32
00:01:20.371 --> 00:01:23.640
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I was still depressed all that time.</v>

33
00:01:23.641 --> 00:01:24.780
<v Speaker 2>I was taking these drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

34
00:01:24.781 --> 00:01:27.260
<v Speaker 2>Most of the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And after 13 years ago,</v>

35
00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.691
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

36
00:01:27.691 --> 00:01:29.310
<v Speaker 2>I need to understand what's really going</v>
<v Speaker 2>on here.</v>

37
00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:30.900
<v Speaker 2>So I ended up going on this big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>long journey,</v>

38
00:01:30.901 --> 00:01:33.960
<v Speaker 2>over 40,000 miles interviewing the</v>
<v Speaker 2>leading experts in the world,</v>

39
00:01:33.961 --> 00:01:36.120
<v Speaker 2>and what causes depression and anxiety</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what solves them.</v>

40
00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.290
<v Speaker 2>And what I discovered is the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've,</v>

41
00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.920
<v Speaker 2>we've told ridiculously simplistic story</v>
<v Speaker 2>to people about what depression is and</v>

42
00:01:43.921 --> 00:01:46.980
<v Speaker 2>how to solve it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That until I was a teenager.</v>

43
00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:48.510
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I went to my doctor,</v>

44
00:01:48.511 --> 00:01:50.640
<v Speaker 2>I thought depression was all in my head,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning,</v>

45
00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:51.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just been week,</v>

46
00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.450
<v Speaker 2>he'd be in a Percy basically and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>the next day,</v>

47
00:01:54.451 --> 00:01:55.980
<v Speaker 2>10 years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was all in my head.</v>

48
00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.860
<v Speaker 2>Meaning you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a chemical imbalance in your brain.</v>

49
00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.940
<v Speaker 2>What I discovered is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the overwhelming evidence from the World</v>

50
00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:04.260
<v Speaker 2>Health Organization,</v>
<v Speaker 2>leading medical body in the world and</v>

51
00:02:04.261 --> 00:02:07.710
<v Speaker 2>loads of other places is there are real</v>
<v Speaker 2>biological factors that can make you</v>

52
00:02:07.711 --> 00:02:10.200
<v Speaker 2>more sensitive to this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the causes of depression,</v>

53
00:02:10.201 --> 00:02:12.690
<v Speaker 2>anxiety are overwhelming in the way</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're living there with these nine</v>

54
00:02:12.691 --> 00:02:14.200
<v Speaker 2>causes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>depression,</v>

55
00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.380
<v Speaker 2>anxiety for which I could find</v>
<v Speaker 2>scientific evidence,</v>

56
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.260
<v Speaker 2>seven of which in the way we're living</v>
<v Speaker 2>and some of which are rising,</v>

57
00:02:19.261 --> 00:02:22.560
<v Speaker 2>which explains this kind of epidemic and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that opens up a whole different way of</v>

58
00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:23.760
<v Speaker 2>finding solutions.</v>

59
00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.870
<v Speaker 1>Now when you are young and you were</v>
<v Speaker 1>experiencing depression,</v>

60
00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.270
<v Speaker 1>how would you categorize it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what,</v>

61
00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.270
<v Speaker 1>how would you describe it if you had to</v>
<v Speaker 1>describe it to someone who didn't</v>

62
00:02:33.271 --> 00:02:35.100
<v Speaker 1>understand depression?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

63
00:02:35.101 --> 00:02:37.370
<v Speaker 1>Try try to keep this amount of fist away</v>
<v Speaker 1>from sharks.</v>

64
00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:38.760
<v Speaker 2>I think I'll move a bit closer to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

65
00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.930
<v Speaker 2>I think depression,</v>
<v Speaker 2>depression is despair spreading.</v>

66
00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.060
<v Speaker 2>Everyone has moments of hopelessness in</v>
<v Speaker 2>their lives,</v>

67
00:02:45.061 --> 00:02:45.660
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

68
00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.990
<v Speaker 2>It's that spreading further,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think one of the things I learned</v>

69
00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.040
<v Speaker 2>is a deeper way of thinking about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is everyone listening to this,</v>

70
00:02:53.041 --> 00:02:54.420
<v Speaker 2>everyone watching this knows</v>

71
00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.580
<v Speaker 1>they have natural physical needs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

72
00:02:56.581 --> 00:02:58.320
<v Speaker 1>You need food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need water.</v>

73
00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.040
<v Speaker 1>You need clean air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need</v>

74
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.720
<v Speaker 2>warmth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I took those things away from you,</v>

75
00:03:01.721 --> 00:03:03.520
<v Speaker 2>you would be a real trouble real fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

76
00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.320
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is equally strong evidence that</v>

77
00:03:05.321 --> 00:03:08.080
<v Speaker 2>human beings have natural psychological</v>
<v Speaker 2>needs,</v>

78
00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:09.970
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got to feel you belong.</v>

79
00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.670
<v Speaker 2>You've got to fill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your life has meaning and purpose.</v>

80
00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.280
<v Speaker 2>You've got to feel that people see you</v>
<v Speaker 2>and value you.</v>

81
00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:16.870
<v Speaker 2>You've got to feel that you've got</v>
<v Speaker 2>autonomy.</v>

82
00:03:16.871 --> 00:03:19.330
<v Speaker 2>You've got to feel that you've got a</v>
<v Speaker 2>future that makes sense,</v>

83
00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.310
<v Speaker 2>and our culture is good at lots of</v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

84
00:03:21.311 --> 00:03:24.280
<v Speaker 2>I'm glad to be alive today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but our culture has been getting less</v>

85
00:03:24.281 --> 00:03:28.570
<v Speaker 2>and less good at meeting these deep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>underlying psychological needs for lots</v>

86
00:03:28.571 --> 00:03:30.610
<v Speaker 2>of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that is the key reason.</v>

87
00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.590
<v Speaker 2>So only one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's the key reason why we have this</v>

88
00:03:32.591 --> 00:03:34.540
<v Speaker 2>rising depression,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anxiety epidemic.</v>

89
00:03:34.541 --> 00:03:35.830
<v Speaker 2>That can sound a bit weird in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>abstracts.</v>

90
00:03:35.831 --> 00:03:37.570
<v Speaker 2>I can give you some specific examples if</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want.</v>

91
00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:38.433
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

92
00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.040
<v Speaker 2>So I'll give you one example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I noticed that lots of the people I know</v>

93
00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.890
<v Speaker 2>who are depressed and anxious that</v>
<v Speaker 2>depression and anxiety focuses around</v>

94
00:03:44.891 --> 00:03:45.724
<v Speaker 2>their work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

95
00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.330
<v Speaker 2>Start to think what's going on here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I started to look for evidence about</v>

96
00:03:49.331 --> 00:03:52.990
<v Speaker 2>how people feel about their work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Best Research on this was done by</v>

97
00:03:52.991 --> 00:03:54.520
<v Speaker 2>Gallup,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the opinion poll company,</v>

98
00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:56.620
<v Speaker 2>massive detailed study to a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

99
00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.180
<v Speaker 2>They found the figures for how people</v>
<v Speaker 2>feel about working in the u s and other</v>

100
00:04:01.181 --> 00:04:04.450
<v Speaker 2>comparable countries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What they found is 13% of us,</v>

101
00:04:04.451 --> 00:04:08.560
<v Speaker 2>one 3% basically like our work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most of the time we get energy from it.</v>

102
00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:12.610
<v Speaker 2>63% of us or what they called sleep</v>
<v Speaker 2>working.</v>

103
00:04:12.611 --> 00:04:15.070
<v Speaker 2>So they like their work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't hate their work,</v>

104
00:04:15.071 --> 00:04:18.790
<v Speaker 2>they're just kind of enduring it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And 24% of people fucking hate their</v>

105
00:04:18.791 --> 00:04:19.420
<v Speaker 2>work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

106
00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:22.270
<v Speaker 2>Fear and dread it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was quite struck by that when I</v>

107
00:04:22.271 --> 00:04:22.570
<v Speaker 2>looked at it.</v>

108
00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:27.570
<v Speaker 2>That means 87% of people don't like the</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing they're doing most of the time.</v>

109
00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.290
<v Speaker 2>That's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so striking.</v>

110
00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.360
<v Speaker 2>And bear in mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this thing that we don't like is spread</v>

111
00:04:31.361 --> 00:04:32.650
<v Speaker 2>over even more of our lives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

112
00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:37.950
<v Speaker 2>Average person answers their first email</v>
<v Speaker 2>at 7:48 AM and leaves work at 7:15 PM so</v>

113
00:04:38.831 --> 00:04:41.590
<v Speaker 2>this is most of our waking lives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're doing something we don't like.</v>

114
00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.530
<v Speaker 2>I started to think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could there be some connection between</v>

115
00:04:44.531 --> 00:04:48.130
<v Speaker 2>that and this epidemic of awful sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>forms of despair,</v>

116
00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.080
<v Speaker 2>anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 2>depression,</v>

117
00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:51.840
<v Speaker 2>addiction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I start to look for,</v>

118
00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:54.910
<v Speaker 2>scientists had studied this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I discovered an amazing Australian</v>

119
00:04:54.911 --> 00:04:56.980
<v Speaker 2>social scientist called Professor</v>
<v Speaker 2>Michael Marmot,</v>

120
00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:02.080
<v Speaker 2>who I got to know who discovered the key</v>
<v Speaker 2>to what causes depression at work,</v>

121
00:05:02.081 --> 00:05:03.340
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's several aspects of this.</v>

122
00:05:03.341 --> 00:05:05.140
<v Speaker 2>I can tell you the story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how he discovered it.</v>

123
00:05:05.141 --> 00:05:06.940
<v Speaker 2>If you want to think it's an amazing</v>
<v Speaker 2>story,</v>

124
00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:12.300
<v Speaker 2>but the core of it is if you go to work</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you are controlled,</v>

125
00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:17.920
<v Speaker 2>so you feel you have low or no control,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are radically more likely to become</v>

126
00:05:17.921 --> 00:05:18.580
<v Speaker 2>depressed.</v>

127
00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:21.070
<v Speaker 2>You're even more likely to have a stress</v>
<v Speaker 2>related heart attack.</v>

128
00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.500
<v Speaker 2>And I think the reason is clear then</v>
<v Speaker 2>going a bit further than professor</v>

129
00:05:23.501 --> 00:05:24.830
<v Speaker 2>moment does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

130
00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:26.920
<v Speaker 2>human beings need to feel our lives have</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning.</v>

131
00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:29.260
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you're controlled all the time,</v>

132
00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.330
<v Speaker 2>you don't feel like your life has</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning.</v>

133
00:05:31.331 --> 00:05:34.720
<v Speaker 2>You don't feel like you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it disrupts your ability to create</v>

134
00:05:34.721 --> 00:05:37.450
<v Speaker 2>meaning out of your work and it makes</v>
<v Speaker 2>you feel like shit.</v>

135
00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:39.250
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That makes sense.</v>

136
00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:41.830
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so one thing that was really important</v>

137
00:05:41.831 --> 00:05:46.300
<v Speaker 2>to me in everything I was learning in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the research for loss connections was</v>

138
00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:48.970
<v Speaker 2>there was this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it required this kind of shift in my</v>

139
00:05:48.971 --> 00:05:52.000
<v Speaker 2>mind because what I was basically told</v>
<v Speaker 2>by my doctor is,</v>

140
00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.430
<v Speaker 2>your pain is a malfunction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

141
00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:55.480
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

142
00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:58.640
<v Speaker 2>we know what causes depression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just some people naturally have low</v>

143
00:05:58.641 --> 00:06:00.410
<v Speaker 2>levels of Serotonin in their brains.</v>

144
00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:02.210
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

145
00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:05.780
<v Speaker 2>you're clearly one of them that that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's going on here.</v>

146
00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:08.210
<v Speaker 2>And one thing that was really striking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>speaking to the leading experts in the</v>

147
00:06:08.211 --> 00:06:11.120
<v Speaker 2>world is that story is just not true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are real biological factors.</v>

148
00:06:11.121 --> 00:06:12.440
<v Speaker 2>There are real things that happen in</v>
<v Speaker 2>your brain,</v>

149
00:06:12.441 --> 00:06:15.140
<v Speaker 2>obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But actually a professor Andrew Skull at</v>

150
00:06:15.141 --> 00:06:18.620
<v Speaker 2>Princeton University says it's deeply</v>
<v Speaker 2>misleading and unscientific to say</v>

151
00:06:18.621 --> 00:06:20.360
<v Speaker 2>depression is just caused by low</v>
<v Speaker 2>Serotonin,</v>

152
00:06:20.361 --> 00:06:21.680
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is just not true.</v>

153
00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:22.940
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

154
00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:26.090
<v Speaker 2>but one thing that was so important to</v>
<v Speaker 2>me looking at these nine real causes of</v>

155
00:06:26.091 --> 00:06:30.440
<v Speaker 2>depression and anxiety was realizing</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually our pain makes sense,</v>

156
00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:32.120
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're depressed,</v>

157
00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:35.090
<v Speaker 2>if you're anxious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've been told basically that you're a</v>

158
00:06:35.091 --> 00:06:37.010
<v Speaker 2>bit crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's something not working,</v>

159
00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:40.550
<v Speaker 2>but actually you're not a machine with</v>
<v Speaker 2>broken parts,</v>

160
00:06:40.551 --> 00:06:43.220
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're a human being with unmet needs</v>

161
00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:45.620
<v Speaker 2>and that requires a very different set</v>
<v Speaker 2>of responses.</v>

162
00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:46.960
<v Speaker 2>So you think about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I start to think,</v>

163
00:06:46.961 --> 00:06:48.680
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's think about that problem with</v>

164
00:06:48.681 --> 00:06:49.370
<v Speaker 2>work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

165
00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:52.160
<v Speaker 2>Most people feel they've got no control</v>
<v Speaker 2>at work or low control,</v>

166
00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:55.130
<v Speaker 2>and it's making them feel terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not wrong to feel that,</v>

167
00:06:55.131 --> 00:06:57.470
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've got a need as human beings and</v>

168
00:06:57.471 --> 00:06:59.660
<v Speaker 2>it's not being met.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How can we deal with this?</v>

169
00:06:59.661 --> 00:07:03.050
<v Speaker 2>And I learned there's a really</v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting strategy to deal with this.</v>

170
00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:04.490
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is something some people will be</v>

171
00:07:04.491 --> 00:07:06.800
<v Speaker 2>able to do as individuals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's something we can actually</v>

172
00:07:06.801 --> 00:07:09.020
<v Speaker 2>change as a society so far more people</v>
<v Speaker 2>could do it.</v>

173
00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:11.990
<v Speaker 2>I went to Baltimore and I interviewed a</v>
<v Speaker 2>woman.</v>

174
00:07:11.991 --> 00:07:15.920
<v Speaker 2>Could Meredith Kio young woman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meredith used to go to bed every Sunday</v>

175
00:07:15.921 --> 00:07:18.470
<v Speaker 2>night just fucking sick with anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

176
00:07:18.471 --> 00:07:19.304
<v Speaker 2>She would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she would,</v>

177
00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:21.890
<v Speaker 2>she had an office job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't the worst office job in the</v>

178
00:07:21.891 --> 00:07:22.221
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

179
00:07:22.221 --> 00:07:23.960
<v Speaker 2>She wasn't being bullied,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she wasn't being harassed,</v>

180
00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:26.630
<v Speaker 2>but she just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she just felt like she just couldn't</v>

181
00:07:26.631 --> 00:07:28.550
<v Speaker 2>bear the thought of the next 40 years of</v>
<v Speaker 2>her life.</v>

182
00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:31.490
<v Speaker 2>We're going to be this right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one day with her husband,</v>

183
00:07:31.491 --> 00:07:33.380
<v Speaker 2>Josh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she is quite bold thing.</v>

184
00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:36.890
<v Speaker 2>Josh was a working class guy from</v>
<v Speaker 2>Baltimore since he was a teenager.</v>

185
00:07:36.891 --> 00:07:37.780
<v Speaker 2>He that he'd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

186
00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:41.720
<v Speaker 2>worked in bike stores and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>working at a bike store,</v>

187
00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:44.600
<v Speaker 2>your viewers will know it's insecure</v>
<v Speaker 2>work.</v>

188
00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:48.110
<v Speaker 2>It's controlled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You do it boss tells you that you can</v>

189
00:07:48.111 --> 00:07:49.760
<v Speaker 2>get vacations and less the boss,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

190
00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:51.130
<v Speaker 2>it's nice to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

191
00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:53.540
<v Speaker 2>and Josh and his colleagues in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>store,</v>

192
00:07:53.541 --> 00:07:55.700
<v Speaker 2>they didn't hate their boss.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't a particularly bad boss as far</v>

193
00:07:55.701 --> 00:07:57.500
<v Speaker 2>as policies go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They quite liked him as a person.</v>

194
00:07:57.890 --> 00:08:01.310
<v Speaker 2>But one day they just asked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does that boss actually do?</v>

195
00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:04.190
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We fixed all the bikes and he seems to</v>

196
00:08:04.191 --> 00:08:05.780
<v Speaker 2>make all the money was what's going on</v>
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

197
00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:08.110
<v Speaker 2>They decided to do an experiment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

198
00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:08.770
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

199
00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:10.750
<v Speaker 2>they sit up at a different bike store,</v>
<v Speaker 2>arrival,</v>

200
00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:11.240
<v Speaker 2>bike store.</v>

201
00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:14.450
<v Speaker 2>It's called Baltimore Bicycle Works and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it works on a different principle.</v>

202
00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:17.660
<v Speaker 2>So most people listening to this will</v>
<v Speaker 2>work in corporations.</v>

203
00:08:17.661 --> 00:08:18.680
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Top down,</v>

204
00:08:18.681 --> 00:08:21.980
<v Speaker 2>you do what the boss says.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's modeled like an army that is a very</v>

205
00:08:21.981 --> 00:08:25.670
<v Speaker 2>recent human invention rights and comes</v>
<v Speaker 2>along in the late 19th century.</v>

206
00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:29.090
<v Speaker 2>What they did was try different model.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They called democratic cooperatives.</v>

207
00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:33.650
<v Speaker 2>So at Baltimore Bicycle Works,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they take all the big decisions together</v>

208
00:08:33.651 --> 00:08:34.700
<v Speaker 2>about their work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They vote,</v>

209
00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:37.220
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they share out the good tasks in the</v>

210
00:08:37.221 --> 00:08:39.050
<v Speaker 2>shitty tasks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know I can just get stuck with all the</v>

211
00:08:39.051 --> 00:08:41.780
<v Speaker 2>shitty tasks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They share the profits obviously.</v>

212
00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:43.880
<v Speaker 2>So they control their environment</v>
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>

213
00:08:43.881 --> 00:08:47.030
<v Speaker 2>They're like a little tribe that control</v>
<v Speaker 2>their environment instead of an army</v>

214
00:08:47.031 --> 00:08:50.330
<v Speaker 2>with one guy at the top controlling it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one thing that was so fascinating</v>

215
00:08:50.331 --> 00:08:52.970
<v Speaker 2>spending time with them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's totally in finding a professor</v>

216
00:08:52.971 --> 00:08:57.120
<v Speaker 2>Michael Marmots research about what</v>
<v Speaker 2>causes depression at work is how many of</v>

217
00:08:57.121 --> 00:09:00.510
<v Speaker 2>them talked about having been really</v>
<v Speaker 2>depressed and anxious when they were,</v>

218
00:09:00.511 --> 00:09:03.780
<v Speaker 2>when they were working in this</v>
<v Speaker 2>controlled way and their depression and</v>

219
00:09:03.781 --> 00:09:04.810
<v Speaker 2>anxiety had largely gone.</v>

220
00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:07.530
<v Speaker 2>It's to have bad days of course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there that kind of nagging</v>

221
00:09:07.531 --> 00:09:10.680
<v Speaker 2>depression and anxiety had gone away in</v>
<v Speaker 2>this different environment.</v>

222
00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:14.760
<v Speaker 2>And as Josh said to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no reason why any business</v>

223
00:09:14.761 --> 00:09:18.360
<v Speaker 2>should work in this top down controlled</v>
<v Speaker 2>way that makes people depressed.</v>

224
00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:21.570
<v Speaker 2>It's not even more efficient.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And study at Cornell University found</v>

225
00:09:21.571 --> 00:09:24.810
<v Speaker 2>that democratic businesses grow four</v>
<v Speaker 2>times faster than,</v>

226
00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:26.280
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>than,</v>

227
00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:27.000
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

228
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.440
<v Speaker 2>top down businesses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think,</v>

229
00:09:28.441 --> 00:09:29.820
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this opens up is a different way of</v>

230
00:09:29.821 --> 00:09:32.580
<v Speaker 2>thinking about depression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what we've done up to now is we've</v>

231
00:09:32.581 --> 00:09:36.900
<v Speaker 2>said to depressed and anxious people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the job of fixing this is basically on</v>

232
00:09:36.901 --> 00:09:37.890
<v Speaker 2>you buddy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

233
00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:39.540
<v Speaker 2>Maybe if you're lucky,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your family,</v>

234
00:09:39.541 --> 00:09:40.980
<v Speaker 2>maybe if you're lucky,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your doctor,</v>

235
00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:44.100
<v Speaker 2>but actually once you begin to realize</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the reasons why people are</v>

236
00:09:44.101 --> 00:09:47.310
<v Speaker 2>depressed and anxious makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is just one of many reasons why</v>

237
00:09:47.311 --> 00:09:48.840
<v Speaker 2>people are depressed and anxious.</v>

238
00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:50.340
<v Speaker 2>It also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of things is fueling the addiction</v>

239
00:09:50.341 --> 00:09:52.470
<v Speaker 2>crisis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which you can talk about if you want.</v>

240
00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:54.810
<v Speaker 2>And once you realize it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it makes sense.</v>

241
00:09:54.811 --> 00:09:57.540
<v Speaker 2>You suddenly realize what you've got to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do is deal with the problem in the world</v>

242
00:09:57.570 --> 00:10:00.030
<v Speaker 2>as well as the problem just in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>individual skull.</v>

243
00:10:00.031 --> 00:10:00.970
<v Speaker 2>Do you see what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

244
00:10:00.971 --> 00:10:03.270
<v Speaker 2>So you're focusing on work environments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

245
00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:04.363
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's,</v>

246
00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:05.910
<v Speaker 2>there's many reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you were saying,</v>

247
00:10:05.911 --> 00:10:07.500
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for people being depressed.</v>

248
00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:09.960
<v Speaker 2>Have you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you talk about work environments,</v>

249
00:10:09.961 --> 00:10:12.540
<v Speaker 2>have you researched people who are</v>
<v Speaker 2>independent,</v>

250
00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:14.800
<v Speaker 2>people who work for themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who you know,</v>

251
00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:17.940
<v Speaker 2>make things or make furniture or what</v>
<v Speaker 2>have you.</v>

252
00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:19.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was one of the things as well</v>

253
00:10:19.501 --> 00:10:23.010
<v Speaker 2>at Baltimore Bicycle access,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most people are so removed from the</v>

254
00:10:23.011 --> 00:10:24.360
<v Speaker 2>product,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from their work,</v>

255
00:10:24.361 --> 00:10:26.220
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the outcome of their work.</v>

256
00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:28.980
<v Speaker 2>To give you an example of a guy I</v>
<v Speaker 2>interviewed a lot,</v>

257
00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:30.930
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy called Joe,</v>

258
00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:34.530
<v Speaker 2>he works in Philly and he worked when I</v>
<v Speaker 2>met him in a paint,</v>

259
00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:35.490
<v Speaker 2>a paint store,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

260
00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:38.250
<v Speaker 2>And Joe's job was to turn up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but whatever it was,</v>

261
00:10:38.251 --> 00:10:42.690
<v Speaker 2>eight 30 in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stay there all day until 7:00 PM and</v>

262
00:10:42.691 --> 00:10:45.240
<v Speaker 2>just take your order for pain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when you ask for a specific</v>

263
00:10:45.241 --> 00:10:47.040
<v Speaker 2>shade,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his job was to put it in a machine that</v>

264
00:10:47.041 --> 00:10:47.874
<v Speaker 2>shook it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

265
00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:49.680
<v Speaker 2>And then just give you the paint.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

266
00:10:49.681 --> 00:10:53.280
<v Speaker 2>That was his whole life week after week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>year after year.</v>

267
00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:57.570
<v Speaker 2>And Joe was acutely depressed and Joe</v>
<v Speaker 2>was really,</v>

268
00:10:57.690 --> 00:10:59.910
<v Speaker 2>felt really guilty about telling me how</v>
<v Speaker 2>depressed he was.</v>

269
00:10:59.911 --> 00:11:00.930
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He kept saying,</v>

270
00:11:00.931 --> 00:11:02.130
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know how lucky I am.</v>

271
00:11:02.131 --> 00:11:04.330
<v Speaker 2>I know how lucky I am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

272
00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:06.990
<v Speaker 2>but he felt like it felt like shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>

273
00:11:06.991 --> 00:11:08.340
<v Speaker 2>I remember him saying to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

274
00:11:08.341 --> 00:11:09.750
<v Speaker 2>I know people need pain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

275
00:11:09.930 --> 00:11:11.610
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that have some function here in</v>

276
00:11:11.611 --> 00:11:13.260
<v Speaker 2>the economy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think to put it quite like that,</v>

277
00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:15.680
<v Speaker 2>but this is not giving me any sense of</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning.</v>

278
00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:18.930
<v Speaker 2>But one of the real mysteries to me</v>
<v Speaker 2>about Joe and for that had to learn</v>

279
00:11:18.931 --> 00:11:22.500
<v Speaker 2>about one of the other causes of</v>
<v Speaker 2>depression and anxiety and solutions to</v>

280
00:11:22.501 --> 00:11:25.620
<v Speaker 2>that was so joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people,</v>

281
00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:28.080
<v Speaker 2>some of my relatives who do work like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

282
00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:31.410
<v Speaker 2>that basically the margin for them to</v>
<v Speaker 2>change their lives,</v>

283
00:11:31.411 --> 00:11:32.370
<v Speaker 2>it's really narrow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

284
00:11:32.371 --> 00:11:35.130
<v Speaker 2>Like one of my closest relatives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a struggling single mom.</v>

285
00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:37.080
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

286
00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:38.640
<v Speaker 2>she's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she works every hour.</v>

287
00:11:38.641 --> 00:11:40.350
<v Speaker 2>She can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she get something today collapses,</v>

288
00:11:40.351 --> 00:11:41.910
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The idea of saying to her,</v>

289
00:11:41.911 --> 00:11:44.610
<v Speaker 2>your job now is to democratize your</v>
<v Speaker 2>workplace is ridiculous,</v>

290
00:11:44.611 --> 00:11:45.960
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>She can't do that.</v>

291
00:11:45.961 --> 00:11:49.680
<v Speaker 2>That's why most of lost connections is</v>
<v Speaker 2>about how we can change the culture to</v>

292
00:11:49.681 --> 00:11:51.930
<v Speaker 2>free people up to make the changes they</v>
<v Speaker 2>need to make.</v>

293
00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:54.520
<v Speaker 2>Although there are things can do that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>go through in the book,</v>

294
00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:56.580
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>

295
00:11:56.610 --> 00:11:59.050
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people,</v>

296
00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:01.120
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how to put it,</v>

297
00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:04.870
<v Speaker 2>they hit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we live in such an individualistic</v>

298
00:12:04.871 --> 00:12:07.900
<v Speaker 2>culture that people think what you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>saying is you need to do it yourself.</v>

299
00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:10.780
<v Speaker 2>But Joe was in an unusual position in</v>
<v Speaker 2>that Joe,</v>

300
00:12:11.050 --> 00:12:12.250
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>loved fishing,</v>

301
00:12:12.251 --> 00:12:14.650
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He'd fished I think 20 of the 50 states,</v>

302
00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:16.510
<v Speaker 2>and he'd recently been to Florida and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

303
00:12:16.511 --> 00:12:17.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was in Florida,</v>

304
00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:21.700
<v Speaker 2>I am,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I realized I could just quit this job.</v>

305
00:12:21.730 --> 00:12:23.500
<v Speaker 2>I could go and live as a fisherman in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Florida.</v>

306
00:12:23.950 --> 00:12:26.440
<v Speaker 2>I'd make less money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd be much happier.</v>

307
00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:28.870
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there was somehow I knew as I was</v>

308
00:12:28.871 --> 00:12:31.240
<v Speaker 2>talking to joe and I filled it up with</v>
<v Speaker 2>them over the years that followed,</v>

309
00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:33.670
<v Speaker 2>I knew he wasn't going to go to Florida.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

310
00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:34.860
<v Speaker 2>And I remember,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

311
00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:39.100
<v Speaker 2>it's just the way he said it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a wistful longing and not musical</v>

312
00:12:39.101 --> 00:12:41.770
<v Speaker 2>idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not something based on a real</v>

313
00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:43.660
<v Speaker 2>possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a really good way of putting it.</v>

314
00:12:43.661 --> 00:12:46.840
<v Speaker 2>But I remember the last time I saw him</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he walked off I and I felt like a</v>

315
00:12:46.841 --> 00:12:49.060
<v Speaker 2>complete Dick for doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I shouted after cause public.</v>

316
00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:51.860
<v Speaker 2>So it's Toni Jo go to Florida.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

317
00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:52.601
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of these,</v>

318
00:12:52.601 --> 00:12:57.070
<v Speaker 2>it really troubled me was why are so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so a lot of people are trapped in the</v>

319
00:12:57.071 --> 00:12:59.170
<v Speaker 2>way our culture works,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is why we've got to change the</v>

320
00:12:59.171 --> 00:13:01.750
<v Speaker 2>culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I talk about specific concrete</v>

321
00:13:01.751 --> 00:13:04.900
<v Speaker 2>things that have been tried in other</v>
<v Speaker 2>countries that have freed people up and</v>

322
00:13:04.901 --> 00:13:06.790
<v Speaker 2>have reduced depressions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure we'll get to that.</v>

323
00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:08.650
<v Speaker 2>But if you think about an individual</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Joe,</v>

324
00:13:08.651 --> 00:13:11.380
<v Speaker 2>what's going on there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things I learned from</v>

325
00:13:11.381 --> 00:13:13.870
<v Speaker 2>this amazing professor Tim Kasser in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Illinois,</v>

326
00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:16.870
<v Speaker 2>Knox College in Illinois is I think one</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the things,</v>

327
00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:19.690
<v Speaker 2>this is one of the hardest courses or</v>
<v Speaker 2>depression to learn about.</v>

328
00:13:19.691 --> 00:13:22.180
<v Speaker 2>Cause I realized how much it played out</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my own life as well.</v>

329
00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:27.600
<v Speaker 2>So just like we all know junk food has</v>
<v Speaker 2>taken over our diets and made us</v>

330
00:13:27.941 --> 00:13:29.050
<v Speaker 2>physically sick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

331
00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:32.710
<v Speaker 2>Something similar has happened with our</v>
<v Speaker 2>minds are kind of junk values have taken</v>

332
00:13:32.711 --> 00:13:34.600
<v Speaker 2>over our minds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I started learning about this,</v>

333
00:13:34.610 --> 00:13:38.780
<v Speaker 2>I remember I ate nothing but junk food</v>
<v Speaker 2>for like 10 years from my twenties</v>

334
00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:41.260
<v Speaker 2>basically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I remember one day,</v>

335
00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:43.520
<v Speaker 2>it makes it even the story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even Saturday,</v>

336
00:13:43.521 --> 00:13:48.250
<v Speaker 2>it was Christmas Eve in 2009 at</v>
<v Speaker 2>lunchtime I went to my local KFC and I</v>

337
00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:49.300
<v Speaker 2>ordered,</v>
<v Speaker 2>set my order,</v>

338
00:13:49.301 --> 00:13:51.250
<v Speaker 2>which I won't even repeat it to you</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause it was so disgusting.</v>

339
00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:54.280
<v Speaker 2>And the guy behind the counter said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah man,</v>

340
00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:56.350
<v Speaker 2>we're so glad you're here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

341
00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:57.071
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>

342
00:13:57.071 --> 00:13:57.904
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute.</v>

343
00:13:58.180 --> 00:14:03.180
<v Speaker 2>And he went back and he came out and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>whole staff fucking massive Christmas</v>

344
00:14:03.341 --> 00:14:06.400
<v Speaker 2>card for me and they'd written it to our</v>
<v Speaker 2>best customer.</v>

345
00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:10.810
<v Speaker 2>And my heart is like sang because I look</v>
<v Speaker 2>at this and I suddenly realized this</v>

346
00:14:10.811 --> 00:14:13.060
<v Speaker 2>wasn't even the fried chicken shop I</v>
<v Speaker 2>went to the most.</v>

347
00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:16.000
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was at an extreme end of the junk</v>

348
00:14:16.001 --> 00:14:16.781
<v Speaker 2>food spectrum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

349
00:14:16.781 --> 00:14:18.790
<v Speaker 2>I'm not anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've relapsed a bit lately,</v>

350
00:14:18.970 --> 00:14:19.803
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

351
00:14:20.070 --> 00:14:21.910
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but so we all know how that works,</v>

352
00:14:21.911 --> 00:14:24.280
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Junk food appeals to the part of us</v>

353
00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:28.720
<v Speaker 2>evolve to what nutrients,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it tricks that it's not actually a</v>

354
00:14:28.721 --> 00:14:30.970
<v Speaker 2>part of you that wants nutrients.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It actually makes you sick.</v>

355
00:14:30.971 --> 00:14:33.010
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what Professor Casio Fan,</v>

356
00:14:33.011 --> 00:14:34.660
<v Speaker 2>this is the similar things happen in our</v>
<v Speaker 2>mind.</v>

357
00:14:34.661 --> 00:14:35.660
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

358
00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:38.140
<v Speaker 2>weirdly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so for thousands of years,</v>

359
00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:41.080
<v Speaker 2>philosophers have said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you think life is about,</v>

360
00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:43.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>money and status and showing off,</v>

361
00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:45.670
<v Speaker 2>you're going to feel like shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

362
00:14:46.090 --> 00:14:47.800
<v Speaker 2>But it's not an exact quote from</v>
<v Speaker 2>Confucius,</v>

363
00:14:47.801 --> 00:14:49.210
<v Speaker 2>but as the gist of what he said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

364
00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:52.640
<v Speaker 2>But weirdly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one had scientifically investigated</v>

365
00:14:52.641 --> 00:14:54.470
<v Speaker 2>this until,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

366
00:14:54.471 --> 00:14:59.300
<v Speaker 2>until Professor Cassa 25 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he knew that basically to put it</v>

367
00:14:59.301 --> 00:15:01.580
<v Speaker 2>crudely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's two kinds of motives that human</v>

368
00:15:01.581 --> 00:15:02.480
<v Speaker 2>beings have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

369
00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:03.560
<v Speaker 2>You've got them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got them.</v>

370
00:15:03.561 --> 00:15:04.790
<v Speaker 2>Jamie's got them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's got them.</v>

371
00:15:04.791 --> 00:15:05.820
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

372
00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:09.440
<v Speaker 2>the first that might just imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine if you play the piano,</v>

373
00:15:09.441 --> 00:15:10.191
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm totally,</v>

374
00:15:10.191 --> 00:15:12.230
<v Speaker 2>I'm musical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But imagine if you played the piano.</v>

375
00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:15.260
<v Speaker 2>If you play the piano in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause you love it.</v>

376
00:15:15.261 --> 00:15:18.620
<v Speaker 2>And it gives you joy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's called an intrinsic motive to</v>

377
00:15:18.621 --> 00:15:19.490
<v Speaker 2>play the piano,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

378
00:15:19.491 --> 00:15:20.920
<v Speaker 2>You're not doing it to get anything out</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

379
00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:22.310
<v Speaker 2>You're just doing it because you love</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

380
00:15:22.311 --> 00:15:24.440
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The experience is the point.</v>

381
00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:28.040
<v Speaker 2>Now I imagine he played the piano in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>dive bar,</v>

382
00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:29.413
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

383
00:15:29.510 --> 00:15:31.190
<v Speaker 2>to pay the rent and you don't like it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

384
00:15:31.191 --> 00:15:34.520
<v Speaker 2>Or you play the piano because your</v>
<v Speaker 2>parents really want you to be a piano</v>

385
00:15:34.521 --> 00:15:36.020
<v Speaker 2>maestro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't know there's a woman who's really</v>

386
00:15:36.021 --> 00:15:38.090
<v Speaker 2>into pns,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you learn the piano to impress her.</v>

387
00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:41.210
<v Speaker 2>That would be an extrinsic reason to</v>
<v Speaker 2>play the piano,</v>

388
00:15:41.211 --> 00:15:41.360
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

389
00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:42.920
<v Speaker 2>You're not doing it for the thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>itself.</v>

390
00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:44.031
<v Speaker 2>You're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not.</v>

391
00:15:44.031 --> 00:15:45.500
<v Speaker 2>You're doing it to get something out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

392
00:15:45.501 --> 00:15:47.660
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what Professor Cassa discovered</v>

393
00:15:47.661 --> 00:15:49.190
<v Speaker 2>loads of really important things about</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

394
00:15:49.191 --> 00:15:51.560
<v Speaker 2>but there's a few.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're all a mixture of these things,</v>

395
00:15:51.561 --> 00:15:55.760
<v Speaker 2>but we move throughout our lives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what we discovered is the more you</v>

396
00:15:55.761 --> 00:15:59.570
<v Speaker 2>are driven by extrinsic values,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more your life is guided by how you</v>

397
00:15:59.571 --> 00:16:03.620
<v Speaker 2>look to the outside by you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you're trying to get out of life</v>

398
00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:07.340
<v Speaker 2>rather than enjoying it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The more you will become depressed and</v>

399
00:16:07.341 --> 00:16:10.640
<v Speaker 2>anxious by quite a large margin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's loads of studies that show this.</v>

400
00:16:11.010 --> 00:16:13.190
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and also he found that we have become</v>

401
00:16:13.191 --> 00:16:17.600
<v Speaker 2>much more obsessed with much more driven</v>
<v Speaker 2>by these values over the last 30 years,</v>

402
00:16:17.601 --> 00:16:20.270
<v Speaker 2>but all sorts of reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>partly because we,</v>

403
00:16:20.390 --> 00:16:22.910
<v Speaker 2>from the minute we're born,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're immersed in a machine that tells</v>

404
00:16:22.911 --> 00:16:25.190
<v Speaker 2>us life is about consumption,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

405
00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:29.990
<v Speaker 2>About externally consuming things more</v>
<v Speaker 2>18 month old children know what the</v>

406
00:16:29.991 --> 00:16:32.780
<v Speaker 2>Mcdonald's m means,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the know their own last name,</v>

407
00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:33.860
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this,</v>

408
00:16:33.861 --> 00:16:37.520
<v Speaker 2>this machine constantly geared towards</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting us to think extra.</v>

409
00:16:37.521 --> 00:16:39.490
<v Speaker 2>As I mentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine an advert that said to,</v>

410
00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:40.910
<v Speaker 2>you know Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you look great today.</v>

411
00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:42.050
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you smell great,</v>

412
00:16:42.051 --> 00:16:43.100
<v Speaker 2>you're doing fine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

413
00:16:43.101 --> 00:16:45.800
<v Speaker 2>You don't need to buy anything today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That would from the perspective of the</v>

414
00:16:45.801 --> 00:16:48.850
<v Speaker 2>advertising industry be the worst,</v>
<v Speaker 2>worst advice ever.</v>

415
00:16:48.851 --> 00:16:53.300
<v Speaker 2>I would make you want to buy anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this movement towards these kinds of</v>

416
00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:57.800
<v Speaker 2>junk values and any shows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lots of reasons why these junk values</v>

417
00:16:57.801 --> 00:17:01.310
<v Speaker 2>make us feel like share.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One is it just corrodes the quality of</v>

418
00:17:01.311 --> 00:17:02.750
<v Speaker 2>your relationships,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

419
00:17:03.290 --> 00:17:05.600
<v Speaker 2>If your wife,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you think your wife loves you,</v>

420
00:17:05.870 --> 00:17:08.990
<v Speaker 2>not because you're you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but because you're rich,</v>

421
00:17:09.170 --> 00:17:11.330
<v Speaker 2>because you look good or for some other</v>
<v Speaker 2>reason,</v>

422
00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:13.970
<v Speaker 2>then think about the insecurity that</v>
<v Speaker 2>enters into that relationship.</v>

423
00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:14.830
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

424
00:17:14.831 --> 00:17:16.490
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you suddenly got fat or if you</v>

425
00:17:16.491 --> 00:17:18.650
<v Speaker 2>suddenly lost all your money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's over.</v>

426
00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:22.490
<v Speaker 2>It creates that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That sand of insecurity enters all your</v>

427
00:17:22.491 --> 00:17:25.190
<v Speaker 2>relationships.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The more you're extrinsically motivated,</v>

428
00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:28.340
<v Speaker 2>the more insecure your relationships</v>
<v Speaker 2>will be in the worst you'll feel.</v>

429
00:17:28.610 --> 00:17:32.120
<v Speaker 2>Or another example would be something</v>
<v Speaker 2>that really makes human beings feel good</v>

430
00:17:32.121 --> 00:17:34.360
<v Speaker 2>or what are called flow states right</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

431
00:17:34.370 --> 00:17:37.490
<v Speaker 2>Moments when you're doing something you</v>
<v Speaker 2>love the meats writing view.</v>

432
00:17:37.491 --> 00:17:40.060
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure it's partly broadcasting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>partly working out as you can see it.</v>

433
00:17:40.061 --> 00:17:41.440
<v Speaker 2>It's not working out for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

434
00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:44.660
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the where you just get into the zone and</v>

435
00:17:44.661 --> 00:17:47.330
<v Speaker 2>time seems to collapse and you're in</v>
<v Speaker 2>that moment,</v>

436
00:17:47.331 --> 00:17:50.580
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what x thinking extrinsically,</v>

437
00:17:50.581 --> 00:17:54.870
<v Speaker 2>what being dominated by these junk</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bonnie's does is it jolts you out of the</v>

438
00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:57.120
<v Speaker 2>intrinsic vice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine you'd go back to the piano</v>

439
00:17:57.121 --> 00:17:59.280
<v Speaker 2>example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're playing the piano just because</v>

440
00:17:59.281 --> 00:18:03.330
<v Speaker 2>you love it and then suddenly you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>am I the best piano player in Los</v>

441
00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:03.960
<v Speaker 2>Angeles today?</v>

442
00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:05.550
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How are these people in this room</v>

443
00:18:05.551 --> 00:18:08.820
<v Speaker 2>thinking about my piano playing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much am I gonna be paid for this</v>

444
00:18:08.821 --> 00:18:10.950
<v Speaker 2>piano player?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can see how that would jolt you out</v>

445
00:18:10.951 --> 00:18:11.960
<v Speaker 2>of the flow state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

446
00:18:11.970 --> 00:18:13.950
<v Speaker 2>People,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more we are driven by extrinsic</v>

447
00:18:13.951 --> 00:18:15.930
<v Speaker 2>values,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the less we get into flow states and the</v>

448
00:18:15.931 --> 00:18:17.610
<v Speaker 2>worst we feel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's lots of other reasons as</v>

449
00:18:17.611 --> 00:18:20.520
<v Speaker 2>well one took about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but well that completely makes sense</v>

450
00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:25.230
<v Speaker 2>that relying constantly on other</v>
<v Speaker 2>people's approval and recognition and</v>

451
00:18:25.231 --> 00:18:29.270
<v Speaker 2>love in order for you to be satisfied</v>
<v Speaker 2>and happy isn't,</v>

452
00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:32.370
<v Speaker 2>is not a good recipe for getting by in</v>
<v Speaker 2>this life smoothly.</v>

453
00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:35.370
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you were young and you were</v>

454
00:18:35.371 --> 00:18:37.590
<v Speaker 2>experiencing depression as you called</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

455
00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:40.800
<v Speaker 2>what was the root cause of it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in my case it was a,</v>

456
00:18:40.810 --> 00:18:43.770
<v Speaker 2>I mean there are a few things going on</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is difficult for me to talk</v>

457
00:18:43.771 --> 00:18:44.604
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

458
00:18:44.710 --> 00:18:46.840
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the people I've got to know for</v>

459
00:18:46.841 --> 00:18:51.060
<v Speaker 2>the loss connections is this amazing guy</v>
<v Speaker 2>called Dr. Vincent Felitti and San</v>

460
00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:51.660
<v Speaker 2>Diego.</v>

461
00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:53.490
<v Speaker 2>And if you don't mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you his story first and I'll</v>

462
00:18:53.491 --> 00:18:56.730
<v Speaker 2>tell you why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What made me realize about myself and</v>

463
00:18:56.731 --> 00:18:58.530
<v Speaker 2>actually why I was very resistant to</v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

464
00:18:58.950 --> 00:19:01.980
<v Speaker 2>So it's going very resistant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>resistant to this insight that he had</v>

465
00:19:02.850 --> 00:19:05.320
<v Speaker 2>and really did not want to absorb it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

466
00:19:05.550 --> 00:19:09.420
<v Speaker 2>so he actually made this discovery and</v>
<v Speaker 2>sca cycle talking about a whole other</v>

467
00:19:09.421 --> 00:19:10.231
<v Speaker 2>subject,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but trust me,</v>

468
00:19:10.231 --> 00:19:12.030
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it gets to depression.</v>

469
00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:13.680
<v Speaker 2>It led to an incredible breakthrough in</v>
<v Speaker 2>depression.</v>

470
00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:16.380
<v Speaker 2>So in the mid 1980s,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doctor Felitti is doing all this</v>

471
00:19:16.381 --> 00:19:18.720
<v Speaker 2>research into obesity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically,</v>

472
00:19:18.721 --> 00:19:22.620
<v Speaker 2>Kaiser permanente or not for profit</v>
<v Speaker 2>medical provider down in San Diego,</v>

473
00:19:23.070 --> 00:19:25.050
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just had a massive fucking problem with</v>

474
00:19:25.051 --> 00:19:25.801
<v Speaker 2>obesity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

475
00:19:25.801 --> 00:19:30.570
<v Speaker 2>There is just hugely growing problem</v>
<v Speaker 2>with obesity and,</v>

476
00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:32.160
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were trying everything and nothing</v>

477
00:19:32.161 --> 00:19:33.870
<v Speaker 2>was worth like giving people nutritional</v>
<v Speaker 2>advice.</v>

478
00:19:33.871 --> 00:19:35.100
<v Speaker 2>That stage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't working right?</v>

479
00:19:35.610 --> 00:19:38.040
<v Speaker 2>So they basically said to him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they gave him quite a big budget and</v>

480
00:19:38.041 --> 00:19:40.110
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just figuring out what the hell is going</v>

481
00:19:40.111 --> 00:19:40.944
<v Speaker 2>on here.</v>

482
00:19:41.010 --> 00:19:43.520
<v Speaker 2>So he went away and he started,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he started to work within,</v>

483
00:19:43.521 --> 00:19:46.770
<v Speaker 2>think it was about 350 extremely obese</v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

484
00:19:46.771 --> 00:19:48.720
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>People who are way more than 400 pounds.</v>

485
00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:51.600
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he starts doing all sorts of different</v>

486
00:19:51.601 --> 00:19:54.060
<v Speaker 2>research with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And at one day he just had this,</v>

487
00:19:54.061 --> 00:19:56.700
<v Speaker 2>this kind of almost stupidly simple</v>
<v Speaker 2>thought.</v>

488
00:19:57.150 --> 00:20:00.090
<v Speaker 2>He thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what if they just literally stopped</v>

489
00:20:00.091 --> 00:20:02.700
<v Speaker 2>eating and we gave them the nutrients</v>
<v Speaker 2>they need?</v>

490
00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:06.090
<v Speaker 2>Would they just lose loads of weight and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then come down to a healthy weight?</v>

491
00:20:06.091 --> 00:20:09.000
<v Speaker 2>So they obviously we'd like massive</v>
<v Speaker 2>medical supervision.</v>

492
00:20:09.001 --> 00:20:10.740
<v Speaker 2>They did this right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>People,</v>

493
00:20:10.770 --> 00:20:12.990
<v Speaker 2>they just monitor them and they stop</v>
<v Speaker 2>eating and they give them loads of</v>

494
00:20:12.991 --> 00:20:16.560
<v Speaker 2>vitamins and everything and it worked</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

495
00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:19.890
<v Speaker 2>They did in fact lose loads of weight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then something happened that no one</v>

496
00:20:19.891 --> 00:20:20.641
<v Speaker 2>expected.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a woman,</v>

497
00:20:20.641 --> 00:20:23.220
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to call Susan to protect her</v>
<v Speaker 2>medical confidentiality.</v>

498
00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:27.900
<v Speaker 2>She been over 400 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She got down to 138 pounds and one and</v>

499
00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:30.630
<v Speaker 2>everyone's celebrating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They think vincent is like a miracle</v>

500
00:20:30.631 --> 00:20:33.300
<v Speaker 2>worker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then one day she freaks the fuck</v>

501
00:20:33.301 --> 00:20:35.880
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Starts Massively obsessively eating.</v>

502
00:20:36.210 --> 00:20:38.910
<v Speaker 2>And very quickly she's back to not quite</v>
<v Speaker 2>where she was,</v>

503
00:20:38.911 --> 00:20:39.744
<v Speaker 2>but close.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

504
00:20:40.170 --> 00:20:41.760
<v Speaker 2>And Vincent sits with Susan and he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

505
00:20:42.150 --> 00:20:43.080
<v Speaker 2>what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she's like,</v>

506
00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:44.640
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>

507
00:20:44.641 --> 00:20:46.140
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tell me about the day you cracked.</v>

508
00:20:46.141 --> 00:20:47.920
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tell out something had happened to her</v>

509
00:20:47.921 --> 00:20:51.550
<v Speaker 2>that hadn't happened to her in I think</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever or sitting in a very long time.</v>

510
00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:53.890
<v Speaker 2>A man hit on her right when she'd been</v>
<v Speaker 2>huge,</v>

511
00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:54.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>huge overweight,</v>

512
00:20:54.851 --> 00:20:58.510
<v Speaker 2>no matter down to a man hit on her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was the trigger,</v>

513
00:20:58.511 --> 00:20:59.010
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>

514
00:20:59.010 --> 00:21:01.030
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they talk a lot more and it's like,</v>

515
00:21:01.210 --> 00:21:03.090
<v Speaker 2>when was it you started to put on weight</v>
<v Speaker 2>for her?</v>

516
00:21:03.090 --> 00:21:05.200
<v Speaker 2>It was when she was 11.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

517
00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:06.191
<v Speaker 2>and so he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

518
00:21:06.191 --> 00:21:07.480
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happened when you were 11 that</v>

519
00:21:07.481 --> 00:21:10.000
<v Speaker 2>didn't happen when you were 10 that</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't happen when you were 12 or 50.</v>

520
00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:11.313
<v Speaker 2>And she said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

521
00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:14.950
<v Speaker 2>well that's when my grandfather started</v>
<v Speaker 2>raping me and he,</v>

522
00:21:14.951 --> 00:21:18.970
<v Speaker 2>this just really start with him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he starts talking to the group and</v>

523
00:21:18.971 --> 00:21:22.000
<v Speaker 2>he's got about 55% of the extremely</v>
<v Speaker 2>overweight people in the group.</v>

524
00:21:22.130 --> 00:21:26.380
<v Speaker 2>I have 50% people in the group has had</v>
<v Speaker 2>on their way after being sexually</v>

525
00:21:26.381 --> 00:21:27.310
<v Speaker 2>abused.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

526
00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:30.400
<v Speaker 2>Which was an extraordinary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>far more than the wider population is</v>

527
00:21:30.401 --> 00:21:30.851
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

528
00:21:30.851 --> 00:21:32.020
<v Speaker 2>what's going on here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is really,</v>

529
00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:35.350
<v Speaker 2>Susan said to him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>overweight is overlooked.</v>

530
00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:37.360
<v Speaker 2>And that's what I wanted to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

531
00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:39.970
<v Speaker 2>So this thing that had looked like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>pathology,</v>

532
00:21:39.971 --> 00:21:41.140
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it is a pathology.</v>

533
00:21:41.141 --> 00:21:43.210
<v Speaker 2>One sense being extremely overweight</v>
<v Speaker 2>will kill you.</v>

534
00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:45.580
<v Speaker 2>Suddenly didn't look like a sign of</v>
<v Speaker 2>madness.</v>

535
00:21:45.581 --> 00:21:48.340
<v Speaker 2>It was actually performing a function</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we couldn't see,</v>

536
00:21:48.430 --> 00:21:49.630
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

537
00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:50.493
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

538
00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:52.990
<v Speaker 2>it was protecting them from sexual</v>
<v Speaker 2>attention.</v>

539
00:21:53.170 --> 00:21:54.430
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a small group.</v>

540
00:21:54.431 --> 00:21:56.470
<v Speaker 2>It's a small study.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Vincent wanted to get a lot more</v>

541
00:21:56.471 --> 00:21:57.850
<v Speaker 2>research on this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is where it led to the breakthrough</v>

542
00:21:57.851 --> 00:22:00.820
<v Speaker 2>in depression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he set it up with funding from the</v>

543
00:22:00.821 --> 00:22:02.410
<v Speaker 2>CDC,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Center for Disease Control,</v>

544
00:22:02.411 --> 00:22:04.810
<v Speaker 2>kind of gold plated a organization in</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

545
00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:07.420
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the u s for this kind of research.</v>

546
00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:11.410
<v Speaker 2>Everyone who came to Kaiser Permanente</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the next,</v>

547
00:22:11.530 --> 00:22:12.670
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was a year,</v>

548
00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:14.380
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for anything,</v>

549
00:22:14.381 --> 00:22:16.680
<v Speaker 2>whether you broke your leg,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you had migraines,</v>

550
00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:18.850
<v Speaker 2>you had schizophrenia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything got given,</v>

551
00:22:18.851 --> 00:22:21.550
<v Speaker 2>a questionnaire and it asked about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it had two parts.</v>

552
00:22:21.570 --> 00:22:22.121
<v Speaker 2>Firstly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it said,</v>

553
00:22:22.121 --> 00:22:24.880
<v Speaker 2>did any of these 10 bad things happen to</v>
<v Speaker 2>you when you were a kid?</v>

554
00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.070
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could be sexual abuse,</v>

555
00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:28.480
<v Speaker 2>neglect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that kind of thing.</v>

556
00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:31.240
<v Speaker 2>And then it says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have you had any of these problems as an</v>

557
00:22:31.241 --> 00:22:34.420
<v Speaker 2>adult obesity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>injecting drug use?</v>

558
00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:36.250
<v Speaker 2>And at the last minute they added</v>
<v Speaker 2>depression,</v>

559
00:22:36.251 --> 00:22:37.270
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>By luck.</v>

560
00:22:37.690 --> 00:22:40.810
<v Speaker 2>So when they got the results back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the CDC,</v>

561
00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:43.390
<v Speaker 2>we're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck is this?</v>

562
00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:46.390
<v Speaker 2>For every category of childhood trauma</v>
<v Speaker 2>you went through,</v>

563
00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:48.910
<v Speaker 2>you weren't radically more likely to</v>
<v Speaker 2>become depressed.</v>

564
00:22:49.150 --> 00:22:51.790
<v Speaker 2>If you had six of those categories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were 3000,</v>

565
00:22:51.791 --> 00:22:54.430
<v Speaker 2>100% more likely to have attempted</v>
<v Speaker 2>suicide as an adult.</v>

566
00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:56.370
<v Speaker 2>If you were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

567
00:22:56.740 --> 00:22:58.480
<v Speaker 2>if you'd had six of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were 4,000,</v>

568
00:22:58.481 --> 00:23:01.150
<v Speaker 2>600% more likely to become an adult</v>
<v Speaker 2>injecting drug user.</v>

569
00:23:01.151 --> 00:23:04.570
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's a debate about why this is,</v>

570
00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:07.000
<v Speaker 2>and I'm going beyond what Vincent says</v>
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>

571
00:23:07.001 --> 00:23:08.270
<v Speaker 2>but boom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the science says,</v>

572
00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:12.370
<v Speaker 2>and this comes up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>brings it back to my experience.</v>

573
00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:13.870
<v Speaker 2>So I had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was a kid,</v>

574
00:23:13.871 --> 00:23:17.740
<v Speaker 2>I had expressed some very extreme acts</v>
<v Speaker 2>of violence from an adult in my family.</v>

575
00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:20.590
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my mother had been very ill and when I</v>

576
00:23:20.591 --> 00:23:23.170
<v Speaker 2>was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my dad was mostly in another country.</v>

577
00:23:23.650 --> 00:23:24.910
<v Speaker 2>And I experience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's really,</v>

578
00:23:24.911 --> 00:23:26.440
<v Speaker 2>really extreme,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

579
00:23:26.530 --> 00:23:29.590
<v Speaker 2>and frightening acts of violence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I</v>

580
00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:34.540
<v Speaker 2>sound stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But until I went to see Vinson,</v>

581
00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:37.420
<v Speaker 2>if you'd asked me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you think that played a role in your</v>

582
00:23:37.421 --> 00:23:38.770
<v Speaker 2>depression?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would have said no.</v>

583
00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:41.620
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it makes me realize one of the</v>

584
00:23:41.621 --> 00:23:45.010
<v Speaker 2>reasons why I clung to this very</v>
<v Speaker 2>simplistic chemical imbalance theory of</v>

585
00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:50.020
<v Speaker 2>depression for so long,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I did not want to give the</v>

586
00:23:50.841 --> 00:23:53.750
<v Speaker 2>individual who behave so appallingly</v>
<v Speaker 2>towards me,</v>

587
00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:56.990
<v Speaker 2>that sense of power over me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to,</v>

588
00:23:57.830 --> 00:24:00.590
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to think about that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want it to cauterize it.</v>

589
00:24:00.591 --> 00:24:02.300
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to cut it out of my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say,</v>

590
00:24:02.301 --> 00:24:02.691
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

591
00:24:02.691 --> 00:24:04.010
<v Speaker 2>that's bad thing that happens to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

592
00:24:04.430 --> 00:24:07.370
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the reason why I stayed with this</v>

593
00:24:07.371 --> 00:24:08.940
<v Speaker 2>and the reason why I kept,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

594
00:24:10.130 --> 00:24:13.940
<v Speaker 2>spent this time with Vincent in San</v>
<v Speaker 2>Diego and the reason why I kept going</v>

595
00:24:14.090 --> 00:24:17.120
<v Speaker 2>with all these different causes of</v>
<v Speaker 2>depression and anxiety is because once</v>

596
00:24:17.121 --> 00:24:19.430
<v Speaker 2>you understand what's happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can find solutions who otherwise</v>

597
00:24:19.431 --> 00:24:21.670
<v Speaker 2>didn't find,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a second stage of doctor</v>

598
00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:22.820
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] research.</v>

599
00:24:23.150 --> 00:24:25.850
<v Speaker 2>That to me was so powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the reasons why I make</v>

600
00:24:25.851 --> 00:24:29.990
<v Speaker 2>myself talk about this now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you'd indicate it on the form that</v>

601
00:24:29.991 --> 00:24:32.000
<v Speaker 2>you'd experienced one of these forms of</v>
<v Speaker 2>childhood trauma,</v>

602
00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:33.980
<v Speaker 2>the next time you went back to your</v>
<v Speaker 2>doctor,</v>

603
00:24:33.981 --> 00:24:38.360
<v Speaker 2>you weren't called back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the next time you went to your</v>

604
00:24:38.361 --> 00:24:41.090
<v Speaker 2>doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your doctor was told to say something to</v>

605
00:24:41.091 --> 00:24:42.740
<v Speaker 2>you like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hi Joe.</v>

606
00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:46.490
<v Speaker 2>I see on the form you indicated that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>were violently abused when you were</v>

607
00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:49.220
<v Speaker 2>child.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm really sorry that happened to you.</v>

608
00:24:49.221 --> 00:24:53.090
<v Speaker 2>That should never have happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would you like to talk about it and</v>

609
00:24:53.091 --> 00:24:54.590
<v Speaker 2>quite a lot of people said thank you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but no,</v>

610
00:24:54.591 --> 00:24:57.210
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to talk about that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of people did want to about an</v>

611
00:24:57.211 --> 00:25:01.070
<v Speaker 2>average conversations is lost the five</v>
<v Speaker 2>minutes and then the doctor said,</v>

612
00:25:01.071 --> 00:25:03.410
<v Speaker 2>I can refer you to a therapist to talk</v>
<v Speaker 2>more about this if you want,</v>

613
00:25:03.890 --> 00:25:05.390
<v Speaker 2>and they were monitored to see what</v>
<v Speaker 2>happened.</v>

614
00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:09.470
<v Speaker 2>The results were kind of incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was an enormous fall in depression</v>

615
00:25:09.471 --> 00:25:12.020
<v Speaker 2>and anxiety just from the five minute</v>
<v Speaker 2>meeting.</v>

616
00:25:12.090 --> 00:25:13.400
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and from the obvious,</v>

617
00:25:13.401 --> 00:25:16.250
<v Speaker 2>people refer to therapy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so an even bigger fool and it seems to</v>

618
00:25:16.251 --> 00:25:16.701
<v Speaker 2>be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

619
00:25:16.701 --> 00:25:18.950
<v Speaker 2>this is going to be this bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be on what Vincent Said</v>

620
00:25:19.250 --> 00:25:20.030
<v Speaker 2>said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

621
00:25:20.030 --> 00:25:20.940
<v Speaker 2>I asked him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said No.</v>

622
00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:24.440
<v Speaker 2>I think partly what happens is it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>related to shame,</v>

623
00:25:24.441 --> 00:25:27.440
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you are a kid and you experience some</v>

624
00:25:27.441 --> 00:25:29.820
<v Speaker 2>kind of abuse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

625
00:25:29.950 --> 00:25:31.580
<v Speaker 2>you can basically do one of two things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

626
00:25:31.581 --> 00:25:32.600
<v Speaker 2>You can either say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

627
00:25:32.601 --> 00:25:33.710
<v Speaker 2>I'm fucked here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

628
00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:37.490
<v Speaker 2>I've unlike a pinball being smacked</v>
<v Speaker 2>around a pinball machine because I can't</v>

629
00:25:37.491 --> 00:25:40.820
<v Speaker 2>stop this happening and I just got</v>
<v Speaker 2>accepted and I'm really vulnerable.</v>

630
00:25:41.150 --> 00:25:45.470
<v Speaker 2>Or you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this must be my fault at some level,</v>

631
00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:47.080
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

632
00:25:47.210 --> 00:25:48.020
<v Speaker 2>which is what I did.</v>

633
00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:50.690
<v Speaker 2>And of course it's what you've been told</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyway by whoever is treating you badly</v>

634
00:25:50.691 --> 00:25:54.260
<v Speaker 2>in almost every case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a weight thing is if you tell</v>

635
00:25:54.261 --> 00:25:59.261
<v Speaker 2>yourself is your full Angelie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you gain a sort of weird internal power,</v>

636
00:25:59.361 --> 00:26:00.820
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not the pymble being smacked</v>

637
00:26:00.821 --> 00:26:02.870
<v Speaker 2>around the machine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're the person controlling the</v>

638
00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:04.370
<v Speaker 2>pimples sheet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can change your behavior,</v>

639
00:26:04.371 --> 00:26:05.204
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't,</v>

640
00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:06.470
<v Speaker 2>you can't change other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the pencils paper.</v>

641
00:26:06.770 --> 00:26:09.050
<v Speaker 2>So you kind of develop this kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>shame.</v>

642
00:26:09.290 --> 00:26:13.190
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things we know is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's plenty of evidence from</v>

643
00:26:13.191 --> 00:26:14.900
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People like Professor Jim Pennebaker</v>

644
00:26:14.901 --> 00:26:18.080
<v Speaker 2>have shown it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shame is a catastrophe for human</v>

645
00:26:18.081 --> 00:26:18.950
<v Speaker 2>psychology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

646
00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:20.120
<v Speaker 2>We know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

647
00:26:20.180 --> 00:26:24.560
<v Speaker 2>openly gay man died two years later than</v>
<v Speaker 2>closeted gay men in the age crisis,</v>

648
00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:26.900
<v Speaker 2>even when they got medical care at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>same time,</v>

649
00:26:26.901 --> 00:26:28.580
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shame destroys you.</v>

650
00:26:28.581 --> 00:26:31.760
<v Speaker 2>It makes you sick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what Vincent found was this model of</v>

651
00:26:31.761 --> 00:26:34.980
<v Speaker 2>releasing your shame,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which led to the significant,</v>

652
00:26:35.270 --> 00:26:37.550
<v Speaker 2>I remember one of the letters he got was</v>
<v Speaker 2>from an old woman,</v>

653
00:26:37.890 --> 00:26:41.510
<v Speaker 2>she was in the 80s who just said she had</v>
<v Speaker 2>been sexually abused when she was a kid.</v>

654
00:26:41.511 --> 00:26:42.890
<v Speaker 2>And she said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thank you for asking.</v>

655
00:26:43.290 --> 00:26:44.820
<v Speaker 2>I thought I'd die and no one would ever</v>
<v Speaker 2>know.</v>

656
00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:49.470
<v Speaker 2>And you can see how that release of</v>
<v Speaker 2>shame would have a transformative effect</v>

657
00:26:49.471 --> 00:26:51.540
<v Speaker 2>on people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

658
00:26:51.630 --> 00:26:55.620
<v Speaker 3>So for you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you had this traumatic experience of</v>

659
00:26:55.621 --> 00:26:58.620
<v Speaker 3>violence when you were young,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were depressed,</v>

660
00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:02.100
<v Speaker 3>you were trying to figure out what the</v>
<v Speaker 3>source of this was,</v>

661
00:27:02.101 --> 00:27:04.440
<v Speaker 3>whether it was some sort of a chemical</v>
<v Speaker 3>imbalance in your brain.</v>

662
00:27:04.441 --> 00:27:05.080
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>

663
00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:07.770
<v Speaker 3>when they say chemical imbalances is in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the brain,</v>

664
00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:10.770
<v Speaker 3>have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are they capable of measuring the level</v>

665
00:27:10.771 --> 00:27:12.180
<v Speaker 3>of Serotonin in your brain?</v>

666
00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:14.010
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's a huge debate about this.</v>

667
00:27:14.011 --> 00:27:14.880
<v Speaker 2>She couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

668
00:27:14.881 --> 00:27:16.500
<v Speaker 2>do autopsies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

669
00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:19.200
<v Speaker 2>there's a big debate about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's when someone's dead.</v>

670
00:27:19.230 --> 00:27:20.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's a big debate about,</v>

671
00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:24.060
<v Speaker 2>so there seems to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most scientists agree low,</v>

672
00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:25.800
<v Speaker 2>not all of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there are some people who dissent</v>

673
00:27:25.801 --> 00:27:28.440
<v Speaker 2>from this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but most scientists agree low serotonin</v>

674
00:27:28.441 --> 00:27:30.060
<v Speaker 2>correlates with depression,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

675
00:27:30.061 --> 00:27:32.430
<v Speaker 2>But it's not the same thing in the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>way stretch marks correlate with</v>

676
00:27:32.431 --> 00:27:34.140
<v Speaker 2>obesity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're not the cause of obesity</v>

677
00:27:34.141 --> 00:27:36.900
<v Speaker 2>that the product of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there are real brain changes that</v>

678
00:27:36.901 --> 00:27:38.430
<v Speaker 2>happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I write about in Los Connections</v>

679
00:27:38.431 --> 00:27:40.030
<v Speaker 2>and important to say that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

680
00:27:40.070 --> 00:27:42.420
<v Speaker 2>that I don't think they should be</v>
<v Speaker 2>described as chemical imbalances.</v>

681
00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:44.010
<v Speaker 2>But one of these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was really shocking to me,</v>

682
00:27:44.011 --> 00:27:46.080
<v Speaker 2>was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the British experts on this Dr.</v>

683
00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:47.520
<v Speaker 2>David Healey said to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

684
00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:51.180
<v Speaker 2>you can't even say the Sarah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea that depression causes</v>

685
00:27:51.181 --> 00:27:52.014
<v Speaker 2>serotonin.</v>

686
00:27:52.620 --> 00:27:57.000
<v Speaker 2>You can't even say that that theory is</v>
<v Speaker 2>discredited because it was never</v>

687
00:27:57.001 --> 00:27:59.370
<v Speaker 2>credited.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was never a time when half of the</v>

688
00:27:59.371 --> 00:28:01.140
<v Speaker 2>scientists in the field believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

689
00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:05.760
<v Speaker 2>The reason that story got sold to me and</v>
<v Speaker 2>most people listening to this in the 90s</v>

690
00:28:06.030 --> 00:28:08.220
<v Speaker 2>is because it worked really well for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>drug companies,</v>

691
00:28:08.221 --> 00:28:09.720
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because what it makes it sound like if</v>

692
00:28:09.721 --> 00:28:12.030
<v Speaker 2>you've just got a chemical imbalance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the solution is just to give you</v>

693
00:28:12.031 --> 00:28:14.050
<v Speaker 2>chemicals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now it's important to say chemical anti</v>

694
00:28:14.051 --> 00:28:16.710
<v Speaker 2>depressants do play a role.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can measure that.</v>

695
00:28:16.950 --> 00:28:19.440
<v Speaker 2>And there's a slightly nuanced point to</v>
<v Speaker 2>make about this,</v>

696
00:28:19.441 --> 00:28:21.720
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so depression is measured by something</v>

697
00:28:21.721 --> 00:28:22.740
<v Speaker 2>called the Hamilton Square,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

698
00:28:22.741 --> 00:28:24.780
<v Speaker 2>I've always felt sorry for whoever</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hamilton was.</v>

699
00:28:24.910 --> 00:28:26.940
<v Speaker 2>The only way we remember him is by how</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking miserable we all.</v>

700
00:28:26.941 --> 00:28:29.880
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so how to scale goes from one where you</v>

701
00:28:29.881 --> 00:28:30.810
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

702
00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:35.580
<v Speaker 2>dancing around in ecstasy or on ecstasy</v>
<v Speaker 2>to 51 when you would be acutely</v>

703
00:28:35.581 --> 00:28:36.270
<v Speaker 2>suicidal.</v>

704
00:28:36.270 --> 00:28:38.640
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And to give you a sense of what movement</v>

705
00:28:38.641 --> 00:28:42.120
<v Speaker 2>on the Hamilton scale looks like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you move six points on the Hamilton</v>

706
00:28:42.121 --> 00:28:43.020
<v Speaker 2>scale,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorry,</v>

707
00:28:43.230 --> 00:28:46.440
<v Speaker 2>if your sleep patterns get better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll gain six points on the Hamilton</v>

708
00:28:46.441 --> 00:28:48.420
<v Speaker 2>scale.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if your sleep patterns deteriorate,</v>

709
00:28:48.421 --> 00:28:50.280
<v Speaker 2>so you have a baby is crying all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>

710
00:28:50.490 --> 00:28:52.890
<v Speaker 2>you're generally lose six points on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hamilton scale,</v>

711
00:28:52.891 --> 00:28:55.170
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So professor Irving Kirsch at Harvard</v>

712
00:28:55.171 --> 00:28:57.060
<v Speaker 2>medical school did the best research on</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

713
00:28:57.300 --> 00:29:02.300
<v Speaker 2>and what he found is on average chemical</v>
<v Speaker 2>anti depressants move people 1.8 points</v>

714
00:29:02.490 --> 00:29:03.900
<v Speaker 2>on the Hamilton scale,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

715
00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:07.050
<v Speaker 2>About a third of what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Improving your sleep patterns does.</v>

716
00:29:07.290 --> 00:29:10.140
<v Speaker 2>It's important to say that's an average.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So some people do get more than that.</v>

717
00:29:10.141 --> 00:29:13.890
<v Speaker 2>Some people get less,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you can see 1.8 points is not</v>

718
00:29:13.891 --> 00:29:14.431
<v Speaker 2>nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

719
00:29:14.431 --> 00:29:17.100
<v Speaker 2>If you're acutely suicidal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>1.8 points can take the edge off.</v>

720
00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:19.380
<v Speaker 2>There's real value in giving people that</v>
<v Speaker 2>relief,</v>

721
00:29:19.710 --> 00:29:21.810
<v Speaker 2>but it's not solving the problem for</v>
<v Speaker 2>most people.</v>

722
00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:26.520
<v Speaker 2>I thought I was weird for being on</v>
<v Speaker 2>antidepressants for so long and</v>

723
00:29:26.521 --> 00:29:29.370
<v Speaker 2>remaining depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Turns out I was totally typical.</v>

724
00:29:29.550 --> 00:29:33.420
<v Speaker 2>Couldn't doctor Steven [inaudible] is</v>
<v Speaker 2>professor of psychology has done a lot</v>

725
00:29:33.421 --> 00:29:36.750
<v Speaker 2>of work on this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Between 65 and 80% of people taking</v>

726
00:29:36.751 --> 00:29:38.400
<v Speaker 2>chemical entity depressants become</v>
<v Speaker 2>depressed again.</v>

727
00:29:38.610 --> 00:29:41.230
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can see that's not 100% there is</v>

728
00:29:41.231 --> 00:29:41.730
<v Speaker 2>some balance.</v>

729
00:29:41.730 --> 00:29:44.250
<v Speaker 3>Well isn't that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what a bill of fives for right is</v>

730
00:29:44.251 --> 00:29:47.370
<v Speaker 3>a bill of fire is the idea that your</v>
<v Speaker 3>antidepressant is not enough.</v>

731
00:29:47.371 --> 00:29:50.370
<v Speaker 3>So he take abilify on top of your</v>
<v Speaker 3>antidepressant,</v>

732
00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:52.020
<v Speaker 3>which is supposed to help you even</v>
<v Speaker 3>further,</v>

733
00:29:52.530 --> 00:29:56.130
<v Speaker 3>and it's one of the most prescribed</v>
<v Speaker 3>medications in the country and it's an</v>

734
00:29:56.310 --> 00:29:57.870
<v Speaker 3>antipsychotic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

735
00:29:57.871 --> 00:29:59.070
<v Speaker 3>Well this is terrifying.</v>

736
00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:00.570
<v Speaker 2>The doling out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

737
00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:03.390
<v Speaker 2>one in five Americans will take a</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychiatric drug in their lifetime,</v>

738
00:30:03.391 --> 00:30:05.130
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a sign of a,</v>

739
00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:08.880
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a cultural madness that we are doing</v>

740
00:30:08.881 --> 00:30:11.400
<v Speaker 2>this right where the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now this is not to say that I want to</v>

741
00:30:11.401 --> 00:30:13.290
<v Speaker 2>stress again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is a real value in these drugs.</v>

742
00:30:13.291 --> 00:30:14.910
<v Speaker 2>There is some value to them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's some</v>

743
00:30:14.990 --> 00:30:17.050
<v Speaker 3>value to them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're most certainly over</v>

744
00:30:17.051 --> 00:30:22.051
<v Speaker 3>prescribed and there's most certainly</v>
<v Speaker 3>actual methods that you could use to</v>

745
00:30:23.451 --> 00:30:27.830
<v Speaker 3>improve your life without any sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>chemical intervention that are readily</v>

746
00:30:27.831 --> 00:30:30.230
<v Speaker 3>available to everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like exercise and diet.</v>

747
00:30:30.410 --> 00:30:33.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but those things aren't stressed when</v>

748
00:30:33.351 --> 00:30:34.760
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you go to a doctor,</v>

749
00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:36.500
<v Speaker 3>the first thing the doctor doesn't say</v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

750
00:30:36.501 --> 00:30:38.090
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what we need to do is get you to start</v>

751
00:30:38.091 --> 00:30:40.490
<v Speaker 3>running and get you start eating really</v>
<v Speaker 3>healthy.</v>

752
00:30:40.491 --> 00:30:41.870
<v Speaker 3>And then let's talk about Antifa.</v>

753
00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:44.470
<v Speaker 2>You're totally right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a $10 billion industry and that</v>

754
00:30:44.471 --> 00:30:47.290
<v Speaker 2>doctor giving you drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a crazy numbers you just said.</v>

755
00:30:47.450 --> 00:30:49.120
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think billion dollars.</v>

756
00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:50.200
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is why,</v>

757
00:30:50.230 --> 00:30:51.940
<v Speaker 2>although there is a real value for those</v>
<v Speaker 2>drugs,</v>

758
00:30:52.180 --> 00:30:56.460
<v Speaker 2>would the the the why this is the first</v>
<v Speaker 2>primary and for most people only option</v>

759
00:30:56.461 --> 00:30:59.200
<v Speaker 2>that's offered and one things that</v>
<v Speaker 2>really helped me change think about this</v>

760
00:30:59.201 --> 00:31:02.860
<v Speaker 2>differently and it fits exactly what</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're saying joe is I went to interview</v>

761
00:31:02.861 --> 00:31:06.820
<v Speaker 2>this South African psychiatrist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>got Derrick summerfield and Derek</v>

762
00:31:06.821 --> 00:31:10.240
<v Speaker 2>happened to be in Cambodia when chemical</v>
<v Speaker 2>antidepressants were first introduced.</v>

763
00:31:10.241 --> 00:31:12.310
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where they were interested in</v>

764
00:31:12.311 --> 00:31:13.750
<v Speaker 2>energy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was just there when they were first</v>

765
00:31:13.751 --> 00:31:16.150
<v Speaker 2>introduced in Cambodia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They thought that would have been one of</v>

766
00:31:16.151 --> 00:31:20.050
<v Speaker 2>the last countries in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They made their way to and the Cambodian</v>

767
00:31:20.051 --> 00:31:21.550
<v Speaker 2>doctors didn't know what they were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

768
00:31:21.730 --> 00:31:22.780
<v Speaker 2>So they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is this?</v>

769
00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:26.200
<v Speaker 2>And he explained and they said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't need them.</v>

770
00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:28.390
<v Speaker 2>We've already got antidepressants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>

771
00:31:28.391 --> 00:31:29.740
<v Speaker 2>what do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He thought they were going to talk about</v>

772
00:31:29.741 --> 00:31:31.480
<v Speaker 2>some kind of like herbal remedy or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

773
00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:35.230
<v Speaker 2>Instead they told them a story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a farmer in their community</v>

774
00:31:35.530 --> 00:31:38.980
<v Speaker 2>who one day worked in the rice fields</v>
<v Speaker 2>who one day had stood on a land mine and</v>

775
00:31:38.981 --> 00:31:41.970
<v Speaker 2>got his leg blown off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they gave him an artificial limb and</v>

776
00:31:41.971 --> 00:31:44.950
<v Speaker 2>he went back to work in the rice fields.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But apparently it's super painful to</v>

777
00:31:44.951 --> 00:31:47.530
<v Speaker 2>work in water when your legs been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

778
00:31:47.570 --> 00:31:49.990
<v Speaker 2>we've got an artificial limit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You legs been blown off and I'm guessing</v>

779
00:31:49.991 --> 00:31:52.900
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty traumatic cause he's in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fields where he's been blown up.</v>

780
00:31:53.190 --> 00:31:55.390
<v Speaker 2>He starts to cry all day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't want to get out of bed.</v>

781
00:31:55.391 --> 00:31:56.710
<v Speaker 2>Classic depression,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

782
00:31:56.920 --> 00:31:58.630
<v Speaker 2>They said to Derek,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we gave him an antidepressant.</v>

783
00:31:58.630 --> 00:31:59.463
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was it?</v>

784
00:32:00.430 --> 00:32:01.520
<v Speaker 2>They said?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They explained,</v>

785
00:32:01.570 --> 00:32:04.000
<v Speaker 2>they went and sat with him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They listened to him.</v>

786
00:32:04.450 --> 00:32:08.240
<v Speaker 2>They realized that his pain made sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They realize that actually make Patrick</v>

787
00:32:08.241 --> 00:32:11.410
<v Speaker 2>sense that he felt so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They figured if they bought him a cow,</v>

788
00:32:11.710 --> 00:32:14.170
<v Speaker 2>he could become a dairy farmer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wouldn't be in these fields where he</v>

789
00:32:14.171 --> 00:32:16.480
<v Speaker 2>was being fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they bought him a car.</v>

790
00:32:16.481 --> 00:32:17.770
<v Speaker 2>Within a couple of weeks he stopped</v>
<v Speaker 2>crying.</v>

791
00:32:17.771 --> 00:32:21.130
<v Speaker 2>They said to Derek CC,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dr Kao was an antidepressant.</v>

792
00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:24.370
<v Speaker 2>That's what you mean right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you've been raised to think about</v>

793
00:32:24.371 --> 00:32:27.820
<v Speaker 2>depression the way we have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've been propagandized to that sounds</v>

794
00:32:27.821 --> 00:32:28.750
<v Speaker 2>like a bad joke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

795
00:32:28.751 --> 00:32:29.990
<v Speaker 2>I went to my doctor for an</v>
<v Speaker 2>antidepressant.</v>

796
00:32:30.010 --> 00:32:34.060
<v Speaker 2>It gave me a cow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you understand what all these experts</v>

797
00:32:34.061 --> 00:32:35.920
<v Speaker 2>who I met had been interviewed</v>
<v Speaker 2>extensively,</v>

798
00:32:35.921 --> 00:32:38.500
<v Speaker 2>I've been trying to tell us it's going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to know what the World Health</v>

799
00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:39.333
<v Speaker 2>Organization has been trying to tell us.</v>

800
00:32:39.620 --> 00:32:42.530
<v Speaker 2>Those Cambodian doctors knew intuitively</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they knew through the science,</v>

801
00:32:42.770 --> 00:32:44.180
<v Speaker 2>which is our pain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Makes Sense,</v>

802
00:32:44.181 --> 00:32:46.250
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not crazy to feel like shit.</v>

803
00:32:46.430 --> 00:32:49.880
<v Speaker 2>You've got unmet needs and what you need</v>
<v Speaker 2>his help to get your needs met.</v>

804
00:32:50.090 --> 00:32:52.610
<v Speaker 2>Now some of the things you're talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>about are really good examples.</v>

805
00:32:52.670 --> 00:32:53.510
<v Speaker 2>Exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Diet.</v>

806
00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:55.160
<v Speaker 2>Some of them are these bigger</v>
<v Speaker 2>intervention.</v>

807
00:32:55.161 --> 00:32:57.620
<v Speaker 2>So one of the heroes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of connections is this doctor I've</v>

808
00:32:57.621 --> 00:32:59.520
<v Speaker 2>got to know called Sam Arrington,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>

809
00:32:59.550 --> 00:33:02.660
<v Speaker 2>who is based in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in east London actually,</v>

810
00:33:02.661 --> 00:33:04.190
<v Speaker 2>where near where I lived for a long</v>
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>

811
00:33:04.191 --> 00:33:07.700
<v Speaker 2>very poor part of east London.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And sadly he was never my doctor,</v>

812
00:33:08.030 --> 00:33:11.240
<v Speaker 2>but Sam was really uncomfortable because</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a general practitioners,</v>

813
00:33:11.241 --> 00:33:13.910
<v Speaker 2>general doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Loads of people were coming to him with</v>

814
00:33:13.911 --> 00:33:15.350
<v Speaker 2>depression and anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

815
00:33:16.130 --> 00:33:17.780
<v Speaker 2>And He'd been told him his medical</v>
<v Speaker 2>training,</v>

816
00:33:17.810 --> 00:33:20.870
<v Speaker 2>even though he knew the science was much</v>
<v Speaker 2>more complicated than this to just say</v>

817
00:33:20.871 --> 00:33:22.700
<v Speaker 2>to people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

818
00:33:23.450 --> 00:33:26.150
<v Speaker 2>you've just got a chemical imbalance in</v>
<v Speaker 2>your brain and just drug them.</v>

819
00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:27.800
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Sam thought,</v>

820
00:33:27.820 --> 00:33:28.611
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like me,</v>

821
00:33:28.611 --> 00:33:30.770
<v Speaker 2>he's not opposed to the drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He does give them out to some people,</v>

822
00:33:30.771 --> 00:33:34.340
<v Speaker 2>but he just thought this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is not right.</v>

823
00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:36.620
<v Speaker 2>This isn't dealing with the reason they</v>
<v Speaker 2>feel so shit.</v>

824
00:33:36.621 --> 00:33:38.600
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he tried a different approach.</v>

825
00:33:38.601 --> 00:33:41.750
<v Speaker 2>He noticed that one of the factors that</v>
<v Speaker 2>was making the depressed and anxious was</v>

826
00:33:41.751 --> 00:33:45.920
<v Speaker 2>how profoundly lonely they were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a study to ask the obvious in</v>

827
00:33:45.921 --> 00:33:46.780
<v Speaker 2>Britain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but figures,</v>

828
00:33:46.790 --> 00:33:49.610
<v Speaker 2>it's sort of Britain by Cuban American</v>
<v Speaker 2>examples to study the acid Americans.</v>

829
00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:53.450
<v Speaker 2>How many close friends do you have who</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could call on in a crisis?</v>

830
00:33:53.780 --> 00:33:55.580
<v Speaker 2>When they started doing the study years</v>
<v Speaker 2>ago,</v>

831
00:33:55.850 --> 00:33:58.400
<v Speaker 2>the most common answer was five.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Today,</v>

832
00:33:58.401 --> 00:34:00.860
<v Speaker 2>the most common answer is none,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

833
00:34:00.861 --> 00:34:03.740
<v Speaker 2>It's not the average,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but more people say none than any other</v>

834
00:34:03.741 --> 00:34:05.630
<v Speaker 2>options.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you think about that of people in</v>

835
00:34:05.631 --> 00:34:08.960
<v Speaker 2>America are more people in the United</v>
<v Speaker 2>States have nobody to turn to when</v>

836
00:34:08.961 --> 00:34:10.760
<v Speaker 2>there's a crisis than any other option,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

837
00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:14.000
<v Speaker 2>So you think about what life must be</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when you're alone.</v>

838
00:34:14.150 --> 00:34:16.940
<v Speaker 2>That is not the species.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are the reason why you and I sit in</v>

839
00:34:16.941 --> 00:34:17.331
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>

840
00:34:17.331 --> 00:34:19.610
<v Speaker 2>in La,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reason why we're alive is because</v>

841
00:34:19.611 --> 00:34:23.120
<v Speaker 2>our ancestors in Africa on the savannas</v>
<v Speaker 2>of Africa,</v>

842
00:34:23.121 --> 00:34:24.890
<v Speaker 2>what unbelievably good at one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

843
00:34:25.070 --> 00:34:27.500
<v Speaker 2>They weren't bigger than the animals</v>
<v Speaker 2>they took down,</v>

844
00:34:27.650 --> 00:34:30.740
<v Speaker 2>but they were much better at cooperating</v>
<v Speaker 2>then the animals they took down.</v>

845
00:34:30.950 --> 00:34:34.130
<v Speaker 2>We exist because our ancestors formed</v>
<v Speaker 2>into tribes.</v>

846
00:34:34.370 --> 00:34:37.190
<v Speaker 2>Every instinct we have is to live in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>tribe right?</v>

847
00:34:37.430 --> 00:34:39.470
<v Speaker 2>Bees need a hive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Humans need a tribe.</v>

848
00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:42.560
<v Speaker 2>We are the first humans ever to try to</v>
<v Speaker 2>disband our tribes.</v>

849
00:34:42.561 --> 00:34:44.510
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one's ever done that before in human</v>

850
00:34:44.511 --> 00:34:46.180
<v Speaker 2>history and it's quite running.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

851
00:34:46.230 --> 00:34:46.801
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you,</v>

852
00:34:46.801 --> 00:34:49.470
<v Speaker 3>let me stop you there because we're</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting deep in the weeds here.</v>

853
00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:54.500
<v Speaker 3>What do you say to someone who is happy</v>
<v Speaker 3>with what they do lives,</v>

854
00:34:55.080 --> 00:34:58.080
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a fulfilled life exercises and is still</v>

855
00:34:58.081 --> 00:34:59.100
<v Speaker 3>depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

856
00:34:59.101 --> 00:35:01.020
<v Speaker 3>I thought a lot about this provoked me</v>
<v Speaker 3>to come back to the thing about east</v>

857
00:35:01.021 --> 00:35:02.100
<v Speaker 3>London.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know this is,</v>

858
00:35:02.130 --> 00:35:03.800
<v Speaker 3>this is an issue with a lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

859
00:35:03.810 --> 00:35:05.970
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know people that worship at the altar</v>

860
00:35:05.971 --> 00:35:10.971
<v Speaker 3>of science and modern medicine that</v>
<v Speaker 3>firmly believe that all depression is</v>

861
00:35:11.041 --> 00:35:14.400
<v Speaker 3>because of some sort of chemical</v>
<v Speaker 3>imbalance in the brain and anything that</v>

862
00:35:14.401 --> 00:35:17.700
<v Speaker 3>debates that are anything that disputes</v>
<v Speaker 3>that notion is,</v>

863
00:35:17.701 --> 00:35:19.770
<v Speaker 3>is pisses them off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

864
00:35:19.771 --> 00:35:21.610
<v Speaker 3>I understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I would have been like that for me.</v>

865
00:35:21.770 --> 00:35:22.260
<v Speaker 3>That,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

866
00:35:22.260 --> 00:35:23.680
<v Speaker 3>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was looking at a a years.</v>

867
00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:26.340
<v Speaker 3>Do you get that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some people responding that way?</v>

868
00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:27.181
<v Speaker 3>Sure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course.</v>

869
00:35:27.181 --> 00:35:28.014
<v Speaker 3>Of course.</v>

870
00:35:28.220 --> 00:35:30.650
<v Speaker 2>I think the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the World Health Organization is the</v>

871
00:35:30.651 --> 00:35:32.420
<v Speaker 2>leading medical body in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

872
00:35:32.870 --> 00:35:36.950
<v Speaker 2>They did a survey study of all the best</v>
<v Speaker 2>evidence and they explained very clearly</v>

873
00:35:37.060 --> 00:35:39.940
<v Speaker 2>that the mental health,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

874
00:35:40.290 --> 00:35:41.640
<v Speaker 2>it's a social indicator,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

875
00:35:41.641 --> 00:35:43.800
<v Speaker 2>It has social causes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it needs social solutions as well as</v>

876
00:35:43.801 --> 00:35:45.390
<v Speaker 2>individual solutions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the science.</v>

877
00:35:45.391 --> 00:35:48.750
<v Speaker 2>So this is overwhelming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You won't get many scientists who say,</v>

878
00:35:49.070 --> 00:35:51.180
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in fact it struggled to find any</v>

879
00:35:51.181 --> 00:35:53.970
<v Speaker 2>scientists who say depression is purely</v>
<v Speaker 2>a biological phenomenon.</v>

880
00:35:53.971 --> 00:35:56.190
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pretty much everyone agrees there's some</v>

881
00:35:56.191 --> 00:35:59.040
<v Speaker 2>social and psychological component.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think when we,</v>

882
00:35:59.230 --> 00:36:02.010
<v Speaker 2>it's a weird disconnect between what the</v>
<v Speaker 2>scientists know and what the public is</v>

883
00:36:02.011 --> 00:36:02.844
<v Speaker 2>told.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

884
00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:06.180
<v Speaker 2>I don't know anyone who went to their</v>
<v Speaker 2>doctor who,</v>

885
00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:08.610
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>apart from this wonderful doctor in east</v>

886
00:36:08.611 --> 00:36:12.000
<v Speaker 2>London and we can talk about who went</v>
<v Speaker 2>with depression.</v>

887
00:36:12.001 --> 00:36:13.320
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was told anything other than a</v>

888
00:36:13.321 --> 00:36:14.070
<v Speaker 2>biological story.</v>

889
00:36:14.070 --> 00:36:15.180
<v Speaker 2>Minute maybe asked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

890
00:36:15.700 --> 00:36:17.100
<v Speaker 2>some of them were asked about childhood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

891
00:36:17.101 --> 00:36:18.930
<v Speaker 2>what was your childhood like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And referred to a therapist.</v>

892
00:36:18.931 --> 00:36:20.970
<v Speaker 2>But no one was talking about these wider</v>
<v Speaker 2>social causes.</v>

893
00:36:20.971 --> 00:36:21.511
<v Speaker 2>No one was started.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

894
00:36:21.511 --> 00:36:22.800
<v Speaker 2>do you feel controlled at work?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

895
00:36:22.801 --> 00:36:26.100
<v Speaker 2>like it's a fact that could be making</v>
<v Speaker 2>you make you depressed.</v>

896
00:36:26.101 --> 00:36:27.780
<v Speaker 2>But in terms of the people who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>

897
00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:30.990
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are depressed but don't,</v>

898
00:36:31.110 --> 00:36:32.590
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause there was a real mystery to me,</v>

899
00:36:32.591 --> 00:36:33.411
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew people I thought,</v>

900
00:36:33.411 --> 00:36:35.880
<v Speaker 2>but this guy has got everything and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>feels he's still depressed.</v>

901
00:36:35.881 --> 00:36:38.100
<v Speaker 2>What's going on here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's two things to say about</v>

902
00:36:38.101 --> 00:36:40.920
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One is I started to,</v>

903
00:36:40.921 --> 00:36:42.510
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for various reasons for research,</v>

904
00:36:42.511 --> 00:36:45.570
<v Speaker 2>for something else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was reading some like feminist texts</v>

905
00:36:45.571 --> 00:36:47.160
<v Speaker 2>from the early sixties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

906
00:36:47.790 --> 00:36:50.550
<v Speaker 2>And a really common thing that happened</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the early sixties is women would go</v>

907
00:36:50.551 --> 00:36:52.680
<v Speaker 2>to their doctor and they'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doctor,</v>

908
00:36:52.681 --> 00:36:54.120
<v Speaker 2>there's something really wrong with my</v>
<v Speaker 2>nerves,</v>

909
00:36:54.121 --> 00:36:55.680
<v Speaker 2>people to talk about in terms of nerves.</v>

910
00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:57.220
<v Speaker 2>Then we don't do that anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

911
00:36:57.240 --> 00:37:00.180
<v Speaker 2>something really wrong with my nerves</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I've got everything a woman</v>

912
00:37:00.181 --> 00:37:03.150
<v Speaker 2>could possibly want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got a husband who doesn't beat me.</v>

913
00:37:03.151 --> 00:37:04.830
<v Speaker 2>I've got a car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>got a washing machine,</v>

914
00:37:04.831 --> 00:37:07.410
<v Speaker 2>I've got two kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I feel like shit.</v>

915
00:37:07.590 --> 00:37:08.401
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the doctor would go,</v>

916
00:37:08.401 --> 00:37:09.450
<v Speaker 2>you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and give a value.</v>

917
00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:12.450
<v Speaker 2>Now if we could travel back in time and</v>
<v Speaker 2>speak to those women,</v>

918
00:37:12.451 --> 00:37:15.030
<v Speaker 2>what we'd say is right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got everything you could possibly</v>

919
00:37:15.031 --> 00:37:18.420
<v Speaker 2>want by the standards of the culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's standards,</v>

920
00:37:18.450 --> 00:37:19.830
<v Speaker 2>the culture just wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

921
00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:21.630
<v Speaker 2>As a w as a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a human being,</v>

922
00:37:21.631 --> 00:37:24.060
<v Speaker 2>you need more than just a washing</v>
<v Speaker 2>machine and a car,</v>

923
00:37:24.061 --> 00:37:25.190
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need a fulfilling life.</v>

924
00:37:25.191 --> 00:37:28.290
<v Speaker 2>You need to be a meaning and purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a very similar thing I think is</v>

925
00:37:28.291 --> 00:37:30.750
<v Speaker 2>happening today if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if we don't want to speak to people,</v>

926
00:37:30.751 --> 00:37:32.040
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got everything I could want,</v>

927
00:37:32.041 --> 00:37:32.970
<v Speaker 2>but I feel like share.</v>

928
00:37:33.250 --> 00:37:34.920
<v Speaker 2>So tell me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tell me about your life.</v>

929
00:37:35.190 --> 00:37:39.540
<v Speaker 2>Very often they're working really hard</v>
<v Speaker 2>in prestigious jobs that they don't</v>

930
00:37:39.541 --> 00:37:42.450
<v Speaker 2>like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't enjoy hour by hour to buy</v>

931
00:37:42.451 --> 00:37:45.870
<v Speaker 2>things that don't give them pleasure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It comes back to this hijacking by junk</v>

932
00:37:45.871 --> 00:37:48.900
<v Speaker 2>values that we're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The professor Tim Kasser discovered.</v>

933
00:37:49.110 --> 00:37:53.340
<v Speaker 2>So what you've got is because we've been</v>
<v Speaker 2>told a totally misleading story about</v>

934
00:37:53.341 --> 00:37:55.710
<v Speaker 2>what makes us satisfied and happy as</v>
<v Speaker 2>human beings.</v>

935
00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:58.320
<v Speaker 2>I think it comes up again and again in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the interviews you do.</v>

936
00:37:58.850 --> 00:38:02.070
<v Speaker 2>Cause we'd been taught in different ways</v>
<v Speaker 2>because we've been told him misleading</v>

937
00:38:02.071 --> 00:38:05.040
<v Speaker 2>story about that we live our lives</v>
<v Speaker 2>according to the wrong script.</v>

938
00:38:05.041 --> 00:38:07.320
<v Speaker 2>We feel like shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And rather than question the script,</v>

939
00:38:07.530 --> 00:38:09.600
<v Speaker 2>we think there must be something wrong</v>
<v Speaker 2>with us biologically.</v>

940
00:38:09.750 --> 00:38:12.060
<v Speaker 2>Now there are biological contributions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's important to say that,</v>

941
00:38:12.061 --> 00:38:14.520
<v Speaker 2>but one of these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it really blew my mind on this was um,</v>

942
00:38:15.230 --> 00:38:18.570
<v Speaker 2>Ainsley this woman's amazing social</v>
<v Speaker 2>scientists could talk of Bretford in</v>

943
00:38:18.571 --> 00:38:20.640
<v Speaker 2>Berkeley.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She did this research.</v>

944
00:38:20.641 --> 00:38:22.980
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of simple research.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just asked.</v>

945
00:38:23.070 --> 00:38:28.050
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you consciously decided you were</v>

946
00:38:28.051 --> 00:38:31.410
<v Speaker 2>going to spend more hours a day trying</v>
<v Speaker 2>to make yourself happier,</v>

947
00:38:31.950 --> 00:38:33.750
<v Speaker 2>would you actually become happier?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

948
00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:36.130
<v Speaker 2>And they did this research.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She didn't do a loan obviously</v>

949
00:38:36.130 --> 00:38:38.620
<v Speaker 1>with our colleagues in the United</v>
<v Speaker 1>States,</v>

950
00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:39.820
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Japan,</v>

951
00:38:40.330 --> 00:38:41.890
<v Speaker 1>Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Taiwan.</v>

952
00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:47.200
<v Speaker 1>And what they found was in the u s if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you try to make yourself happier</v>

953
00:38:47.201 --> 00:38:50.380
<v Speaker 1>consciously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do not become happier in the other</v>

954
00:38:50.381 --> 00:38:52.990
<v Speaker 1>countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you try to make yourself happier,</v>

955
00:38:53.230 --> 00:38:55.360
<v Speaker 1>you do become happier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they were like,</v>

956
00:38:55.540 --> 00:38:57.250
<v Speaker 1>what's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they did more research.</v>

957
00:38:57.251 --> 00:39:01.080
<v Speaker 1>And what they discovered was in the u s</v>
<v Speaker 1>and suspend a lot more time here,</v>

958
00:39:01.081 --> 00:39:04.180
<v Speaker 1>but in Britain as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you try to make yourself happier,</v>

959
00:39:04.990 --> 00:39:06.910
<v Speaker 1>you tried to do something generally for</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

960
00:39:07.150 --> 00:39:10.330
<v Speaker 1>You buy something for yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your biggest Alpha [inaudible] tried to</v>

961
00:39:10.331 --> 00:39:14.260
<v Speaker 1>get a promotion in the other countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Generally if you try to make yourself</v>

962
00:39:14.261 --> 00:39:15.940
<v Speaker 1>happy or you do something for someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>else,</v>

963
00:39:16.030 --> 00:39:17.980
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You tried to help your friends,</v>

964
00:39:17.981 --> 00:39:19.080
<v Speaker 1>your family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your community.</v>

965
00:39:19.370 --> 00:39:21.640
<v Speaker 1>We're what countries?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just Japan,</v>

966
00:39:21.670 --> 00:39:23.730
<v Speaker 1>Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and China is most of the race stress</v>

967
00:39:23.731 --> 00:39:24.670
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that if you,</v>

968
00:39:24.730 --> 00:39:27.190
<v Speaker 1>this is a part of their culture that if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to be happy,</v>

969
00:39:27.191 --> 00:39:28.570
<v Speaker 1>you do something for someone else.</v>

970
00:39:28.970 --> 00:39:32.200
<v Speaker 1>It's so implicit in the culture that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they live collectively,</v>

971
00:39:32.350 --> 00:39:34.690
<v Speaker 1>that it's not even just like we wouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if you said,</v>

972
00:39:34.691 --> 00:39:36.340
<v Speaker 1>do you think happiness is an</v>
<v Speaker 1>individualistic thing?</v>

973
00:39:36.341 --> 00:39:37.600
<v Speaker 1>We'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you even talking about?</v>

974
00:39:37.630 --> 00:39:40.900
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that sort of an extrinsic idea as</v>
<v Speaker 1>well?</v>

975
00:39:40.930 --> 00:39:43.990
<v Speaker 1>The idea that you're going to be happy</v>
<v Speaker 1>by trying to make other people happy,</v>

976
00:39:44.020 --> 00:39:46.630
<v Speaker 1>but this is a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So intrinsic values are not about just</v>

977
00:39:46.631 --> 00:39:48.490
<v Speaker 1>internal to yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The things that you value,</v>

978
00:39:48.491 --> 00:39:51.280
<v Speaker 1>so your intrinsic value could be</v>
<v Speaker 1>spending time with your kids,</v>

979
00:39:51.281 --> 00:39:52.890
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was probably most people's</v>

980
00:39:52.891 --> 00:39:54.850
<v Speaker 1>strongest intrinsic value.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If their parents,</v>

981
00:39:55.060 --> 00:39:56.980
<v Speaker 1>it's being with their kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bonding with their kids,</v>

982
00:39:56.981 --> 00:40:00.760
<v Speaker 1>love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My point is if your goal is to get happy</v>

983
00:40:00.790 --> 00:40:04.120
<v Speaker 1>and the way you've chosen to get happy</v>
<v Speaker 1>is I'm going to get happy by making</v>

984
00:40:04.121 --> 00:40:05.800
<v Speaker 1>other people happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

985
00:40:05.830 --> 00:40:07.210
<v Speaker 1>that seems very strange.</v>

986
00:40:08.110 --> 00:40:10.750
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so and that's that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you think about where humans</v>

987
00:40:11.020 --> 00:40:14.290
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't you just make other people</v>
<v Speaker 1>happy because you love them,</v>

988
00:40:14.890 --> 00:40:18.310
<v Speaker 1>but that is a way of loving people and</v>
<v Speaker 1>being present with them is a way but not</v>

989
00:40:18.610 --> 00:40:23.610
<v Speaker 1>as like a specific for with a specific</v>
<v Speaker 1>goal of making yourself happy.</v>

990
00:40:23.710 --> 00:40:27.700
<v Speaker 1>That seems that's not why they do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like when they were told make</v>

991
00:40:27.701 --> 00:40:30.310
<v Speaker 1>yourself happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had an implicit script in their</v>

992
00:40:30.311 --> 00:40:31.000
<v Speaker 1>culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is like,</v>

993
00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:32.080
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I want to make myself happy,</v>

994
00:40:32.081 --> 00:40:34.960
<v Speaker 1>I'll spend time with other people or do</v>
<v Speaker 1>things with other people.</v>

995
00:40:35.140 --> 00:40:36.880
<v Speaker 1>But if you think about it in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 1>human evolution,</v>

996
00:40:36.881 --> 00:40:37.960
<v Speaker 1>it makes total sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

997
00:40:38.420 --> 00:40:41.320
<v Speaker 1>We think about our ancestors where they</v>
<v Speaker 1>evolved.</v>

998
00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:45.740
<v Speaker 1>If you were a group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if our ancestors had been individually,</v>

999
00:40:45.741 --> 00:40:47.980
<v Speaker 1>so we're out to big up themselves as</v>
<v Speaker 1>individuals,</v>

1000
00:40:48.130 --> 00:40:49.510
<v Speaker 1>we wouldn't be having this conversation.</v>

1001
00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:51.270
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it makes us,</v>

1002
00:40:51.290 --> 00:40:53.600
<v Speaker 1>we evolved as a species with instincts</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are,</v>

1003
00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:58.630
<v Speaker 1>there's no argument there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The the motivation of trying to get</v>

1004
00:40:58.631 --> 00:41:02.020
<v Speaker 1>happy by helping other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just seems there's some implicit in</v>

1005
00:41:02.021 --> 00:41:06.220
<v Speaker 1>the culture for most people in say China</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they wouldn't even articulate it</v>

1006
00:41:06.221 --> 00:41:07.870
<v Speaker 1>that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's only if you force them to say,</v>

1007
00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:09.700
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to make yourself happier that they,</v>

1008
00:41:09.701 --> 00:41:12.310
<v Speaker 1>then the script becomes obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's implicit.</v>

1009
00:41:12.610 --> 00:41:15.370
<v Speaker 1>But this script that we have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this idea that the way you make yourself</v>

1010
00:41:15.371 --> 00:41:18.250
<v Speaker 1>happier is as an individual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1011
00:41:18.251 --> 00:41:23.080
<v Speaker 1>just doing something for yourself and</v>
<v Speaker 1>how you start because there is not one</v>

1012
00:41:23.081 --> 00:41:25.270
<v Speaker 1>script in this country of how to make</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself happy.</v>

1013
00:41:25.271 --> 00:41:29.020
<v Speaker 1>That I think that's of sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>disingenuous as I did at the only way to</v>

1014
00:41:29.021 --> 00:41:31.740
<v Speaker 1>make yourself happy is to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

1015
00:41:31.780 --> 00:41:33.710
<v Speaker 1>that's not what people are trying to do.</v>

1016
00:41:33.950 --> 00:41:37.580
<v Speaker 1>What people were trying to do is be</v>
<v Speaker 1>successful and I don't think they</v>

1017
00:41:37.581 --> 00:41:40.160
<v Speaker 1>necessarily equate success with</v>
<v Speaker 1>happiness.</v>

1018
00:41:40.161 --> 00:41:43.040
<v Speaker 1>What would they do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Equate success with as an alleviation of</v>

1019
00:41:43.041 --> 00:41:46.880
<v Speaker 1>debt and the alleviation of problems and</v>
<v Speaker 1>alleviate a lot of the issues that</v>

1020
00:41:46.881 --> 00:41:50.600
<v Speaker 1>people face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hartley and they think of that as if you</v>

1021
00:41:50.601 --> 00:41:52.460
<v Speaker 1>look at the problems that you have when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're growing up,</v>

1022
00:41:52.520 --> 00:41:55.220
<v Speaker 1>you look at the price.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially if you grow up in a poor</v>

1023
00:41:55.221 --> 00:41:58.040
<v Speaker 1>family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the main problems that you face</v>

1024
00:41:58.041 --> 00:41:59.600
<v Speaker 1>is you're worried about paying your</v>
<v Speaker 1>bills.</v>

1025
00:41:59.900 --> 00:42:03.200
<v Speaker 1>So you say some day I'm going to get to</v>
<v Speaker 1>a point where that is no longer an</v>

1026
00:42:03.201 --> 00:42:04.520
<v Speaker 1>issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to make it.</v>

1027
00:42:04.550 --> 00:42:06.720
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

1028
00:42:06.750 --> 00:42:09.920
<v Speaker 1>they're not doing it thinking this is</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to make me happy.</v>

1029
00:42:10.330 --> 00:42:11.163
<v Speaker 1>I I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

1030
00:42:11.250 --> 00:42:14.450
<v Speaker 1>I very rarely see that and which is one</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the reasons why people,</v>

1031
00:42:14.660 --> 00:42:17.810
<v Speaker 1>even people's parents in this freaks me</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fuck out.</v>

1032
00:42:18.290 --> 00:42:20.570
<v Speaker 1>We'll tell them to not pursue their</v>
<v Speaker 1>dreams,</v>

1033
00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:23.960
<v Speaker 1>but instead to pursue something that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>more likely to happen.</v>

1034
00:42:24.470 --> 00:42:29.470
<v Speaker 1>Like don't pursue your dream of becoming</v>
<v Speaker 1>an actor or a singer or whatever it is.</v>

1035
00:42:29.780 --> 00:42:34.250
<v Speaker 1>Instead pursue your dream of being the</v>
<v Speaker 1>foreman at the company you work at</v>

1036
00:42:34.251 --> 00:42:37.790
<v Speaker 1>because that's attainable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you're totally right and there's</v>

1037
00:42:37.791 --> 00:42:40.640
<v Speaker 1>a lot of evidence that you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the financial anxiety is a massive</v>

1038
00:42:40.641 --> 00:42:43.640
<v Speaker 1>driver,</v>
<v Speaker 1>depression and an anxiety.</v>

1039
00:42:43.641 --> 00:42:47.630
<v Speaker 1>Obviously there's a interesting study</v>
<v Speaker 1>that found people who have an income</v>

1040
00:42:47.631 --> 00:42:51.680
<v Speaker 1>from property are 10 times less likely</v>
<v Speaker 1>to develop an anxiety disorder that</v>

1041
00:42:51.681 --> 00:42:53.510
<v Speaker 1>people who don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there was a really interesting</v>

1042
00:42:53.511 --> 00:42:56.930
<v Speaker 1>experiment in how we can respond to that</v>
<v Speaker 1>is when the President Obama said,</v>

1043
00:42:56.931 --> 00:42:58.790
<v Speaker 1>lay in his time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he thinks would have to happen across</v>

1044
00:42:58.791 --> 00:43:00.980
<v Speaker 1>the country in the next 20 years for</v>
<v Speaker 1>various reasons.</v>

1045
00:43:01.490 --> 00:43:03.380
<v Speaker 1>So in Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the 70s,</v>

1046
00:43:03.650 --> 00:43:07.400
<v Speaker 1>the Canadian government chose a town at</v>
<v Speaker 1>random,</v>

1047
00:43:07.490 --> 00:43:08.780
<v Speaker 1>it seems to genuine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had been random.</v>

1048
00:43:08.780 --> 00:43:10.330
<v Speaker 1>It's tangled dolphin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1049
00:43:10.340 --> 00:43:11.990
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone who knows a canter.</v>

1050
00:43:11.991 --> 00:43:13.340
<v Speaker 1>It's about four hours I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>winnipeg,</v>

1051
00:43:13.910 --> 00:43:16.310
<v Speaker 1>and they said to big group of people in</v>
<v Speaker 1>this town,</v>

1052
00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:18.820
<v Speaker 1>we're going to give you guys for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>next,</v>

1053
00:43:18.850 --> 00:43:21.830
<v Speaker 1>for the foreseeable future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to give all of you a</v>

1054
00:43:21.831 --> 00:43:24.410
<v Speaker 1>guaranteed basic income.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to give you the equivalent</v>

1055
00:43:24.411 --> 00:43:26.570
<v Speaker 1>of in today's money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>15,000 US dollars.</v>

1056
00:43:26.571 --> 00:43:28.250
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing you can do.</v>

1057
00:43:28.251 --> 00:43:31.400
<v Speaker 1>That means we'll take it away from you</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's nothing you have to do in</v>

1058
00:43:31.401 --> 00:43:33.500
<v Speaker 1>return for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're just citizens of our country.</v>

1059
00:43:33.501 --> 00:43:34.820
<v Speaker 1>We want you to have a good life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1060
00:43:35.030 --> 00:43:37.010
<v Speaker 1>It was partly because they had a kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>welfare system,</v>

1061
00:43:37.011 --> 00:43:39.620
<v Speaker 1>but it was a lot of people were falling</v>
<v Speaker 1>through the cracks and they wanted to do</v>

1062
00:43:39.621 --> 00:43:41.150
<v Speaker 1>a little experiment to see with this</v>
<v Speaker 1>work better.</v>

1063
00:43:41.570 --> 00:43:43.240
<v Speaker 1>And this was studied very carefully by</v>
<v Speaker 1>women.</v>

1064
00:43:43.250 --> 00:43:45.450
<v Speaker 1>I need to be called Doctor Evelyn for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1065
00:43:45.590 --> 00:43:47.870
<v Speaker 1>to see what happened in loads of</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting things happened.</v>

1066
00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:50.420
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people spent more time with their kids.</v>

1067
00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:54.920
<v Speaker 1>Very few people quit work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of people turns down shitty</v>

1068
00:43:54.921 --> 00:43:57.320
<v Speaker 1>jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So actual overall work standards</v>

1069
00:43:57.321 --> 00:43:59.740
<v Speaker 1>improved because employees have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>attract people with,</v>

1070
00:43:59.780 --> 00:44:01.640
<v Speaker 1>with better standards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1071
00:44:01.910 --> 00:44:03.680
<v Speaker 1>but for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most interesting thing is there was</v>

1072
00:44:03.710 --> 00:44:06.540
<v Speaker 1>a huge full in depression and anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1073
00:44:06.910 --> 00:44:08.450
<v Speaker 1>Depression and anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was so severe.</v>

1074
00:44:08.451 --> 00:44:11.390
<v Speaker 1>People had to be hospitalized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fell by 9%,</v>

1075
00:44:11.690 --> 00:44:15.200
<v Speaker 1>which is remarkable in just three years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the program ended.</v>

1076
00:44:15.380 --> 00:44:17.810
<v Speaker 1>Dr for Jay said to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought was so much about that,</v>

1077
00:44:17.870 --> 00:44:21.110
<v Speaker 1>that I'd learned about the cow dot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To Vj said,</v>

1078
00:44:21.910 --> 00:44:22.940
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1079
00:44:22.941 --> 00:44:24.300
<v Speaker 1>that's an antidepressant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1080
00:44:25.460 --> 00:44:28.100
<v Speaker 1>We should expand our idea of an</v>
<v Speaker 1>antidepressant to be anything that</v>

1081
00:44:28.101 --> 00:44:30.440
<v Speaker 1>reduces depression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I should include pills,</v>

1082
00:44:30.441 --> 00:44:31.800
<v Speaker 1>but also so you're totally right.</v>

1083
00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:32.430
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1084
00:44:32.430 --> 00:44:33.240
<v Speaker 1>I grew up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my dad,</v>

1085
00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:35.490
<v Speaker 1>my dad's a bus driver,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my mom worked in a shelter,</v>

1086
00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:37.140
<v Speaker 1>my grandmother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>clean toilets,</v>

1087
00:44:37.350 --> 00:44:40.050
<v Speaker 1>financial anxiety is a massive driver</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

1088
00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:42.300
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the despair.</v>

1089
00:44:42.301 --> 00:44:44.670
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean more than half of all Americans</v>

1090
00:44:45.150 --> 00:44:47.730
<v Speaker 1>have not because of the incredible</v>
<v Speaker 1>financial pressure they'd been put</v>

1091
00:44:47.790 --> 00:44:50.640
<v Speaker 1>under.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got $500 set aside for,</v>

1092
00:44:50.641 --> 00:44:52.080
<v Speaker 1>for crisis comes along.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1093
00:44:52.380 --> 00:44:54.230
<v Speaker 1>So you're talking about that's a huge</v>
<v Speaker 1>draw.</v>

1094
00:44:54.270 --> 00:44:55.590
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really important cause explain to</v>

1095
00:44:55.591 --> 00:44:57.480
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that's making you depressed and</v>

1096
00:44:57.481 --> 00:44:59.520
<v Speaker 1>anxious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't let a doctor tell you you've just</v>

1097
00:44:59.521 --> 00:45:01.530
<v Speaker 1>got a chemical imbalance in your brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1098
00:45:01.830 --> 00:45:04.740
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll do doctors still say that all the</v>

1099
00:45:04.741 --> 00:45:05.190
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My,</v>

1100
00:45:05.190 --> 00:45:07.050
<v Speaker 1>my nephew's best friend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1101
00:45:07.140 --> 00:45:09.720
<v Speaker 1>just literally a couple of weeks ago</v>
<v Speaker 1>went to the doctor and was told,</v>

1102
00:45:09.721 --> 00:45:11.040
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got a dopamine and balance.</v>

1103
00:45:11.041 --> 00:45:13.780
<v Speaker 1>The doctor said is migrated in the 20</v>
<v Speaker 1>years since I went in there from a</v>

1104
00:45:13.820 --> 00:45:15.600
<v Speaker 1>surgeon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>England in England.</v>

1105
00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:17.710
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get contacted constantly by people who</v>

1106
00:45:17.711 --> 00:45:20.010
<v Speaker 1>were being told they've got chemical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're told they've got chemical</v>

1107
00:45:20.011 --> 00:45:22.860
<v Speaker 1>imbalances in their brains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just as likely to prescribe</v>

1108
00:45:22.861 --> 00:45:25.070
<v Speaker 1>antidepressants in English as they are</v>
<v Speaker 1>American.</v>

1109
00:45:25.230 --> 00:45:26.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>slightly lower,</v>

1110
00:45:26.311 --> 00:45:28.380
<v Speaker 1>but it's still exceptionally high</v>
<v Speaker 1>stills.</v>

1111
00:45:28.580 --> 00:45:32.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's that narrative that an</v>

1112
00:45:32.011 --> 00:45:35.490
<v Speaker 1>antidepressant must be in some sort of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>pill form and that navy,</v>

1113
00:45:35.491 --> 00:45:38.790
<v Speaker 1>even the expression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>antidepressant and antidepressant,</v>

1114
00:45:39.130 --> 00:45:43.320
<v Speaker 1>it's a very confusing thing that we've</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of adopted very quickly in this</v>

1115
00:45:43.321 --> 00:45:45.900
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's a relatively recent,</v>

1116
00:45:45.901 --> 00:45:47.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>over the last 60,</v>

1117
00:45:47.671 --> 00:45:50.760
<v Speaker 1>70 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the people that have</v>

1118
00:45:50.940 --> 00:45:52.610
<v Speaker 1>antidepressants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1119
00:45:52.680 --> 00:45:55.770
<v Speaker 1>in their body that take them all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time and swear by them,</v>

1120
00:45:56.430 --> 00:45:58.110
<v Speaker 1>boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you try to tell them in,</v>

1121
00:45:58.130 --> 00:46:02.010
<v Speaker 1>in any way that there's a better option,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get extremely defensive.</v>

1122
00:46:02.270 --> 00:46:03.420
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have friend,</v>

1123
00:46:03.450 --> 00:46:07.500
<v Speaker 1>she's very smart and she's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's one of the,</v>

1124
00:46:07.530 --> 00:46:10.440
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the people that will,</v>

1125
00:46:11.130 --> 00:46:15.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very aggressively debate this idea that</v>

1126
00:46:15.751 --> 00:46:17.460
<v Speaker 1>it's anything but a chemical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>depression,</v>

1127
00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:18.990
<v Speaker 1>chemical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a inbounds,</v>

1128
00:46:19.230 --> 00:46:20.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she doesn't take care of her body.</v>

1129
00:46:21.330 --> 00:46:23.460
<v Speaker 1>She's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she doesn't exercise all the time.</v>

1130
00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:25.230
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's slightly overweight.</v>

1131
00:46:25.710 --> 00:46:28.200
<v Speaker 1>She doesn't eat the best foods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1132
00:46:28.201 --> 00:46:28.621
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1133
00:46:28.621 --> 00:46:29.540
<v Speaker 1>it's a weird thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1134
00:46:29.550 --> 00:46:32.730
<v Speaker 1>and she's living in a society and</v>
<v Speaker 1>culture that has all these forces that</v>

1135
00:46:32.731 --> 00:46:34.440
<v Speaker 1>are arising that things will feel</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible.</v>

1136
00:46:34.441 --> 00:46:37.320
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so a big thing to me is when I'm</v>

1137
00:46:37.321 --> 00:46:38.890
<v Speaker 1>talking to this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I've had some of that reaction</v>

1138
00:46:38.891 --> 00:46:39.691
<v Speaker 1>as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not too much,</v>

1139
00:46:39.691 --> 00:46:41.310
<v Speaker 1>but I've had some of that reaction as</v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

1140
00:46:41.580 --> 00:46:44.640
<v Speaker 1>First thing for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say I want to expand the menu of</v>

1141
00:46:44.641 --> 00:46:46.320
<v Speaker 1>options.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to take anything off the</v>

1142
00:46:46.321 --> 00:46:47.010
<v Speaker 1>table.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1143
00:46:47.010 --> 00:46:47.843
<v Speaker 1>It's not about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1144
00:46:47.850 --> 00:46:48.960
<v Speaker 1>you say that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

1145
00:46:48.961 --> 00:46:51.690
<v Speaker 1>and I think you're probably being pretty</v>
<v Speaker 1>honest,</v>

1146
00:46:52.020 --> 00:46:54.780
<v Speaker 1>but you really do want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to eliminate mode.</v>

1147
00:46:55.260 --> 00:47:00.260
<v Speaker 1>But just by the standard of improvement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do probably want to take most people</v>

1148
00:47:00.811 --> 00:47:01.950
<v Speaker 1>off of antidepressants.</v>

1149
00:47:01.950 --> 00:47:05.010
<v Speaker 1>Don't you want me to run it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have a choice.</v>

1150
00:47:05.100 --> 00:47:08.070
<v Speaker 1>I would draw an analogy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obesity is massively risen in the</v>

1151
00:47:08.071 --> 00:47:10.410
<v Speaker 1>western world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It hasn't risen because people suddenly</v>

1152
00:47:10.411 --> 00:47:12.780
<v Speaker 1>became greedy and lazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's risen because our food system is</v>

1153
00:47:12.781 --> 00:47:14.760
<v Speaker 1>terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way feed supply system is terrible,</v>

1154
00:47:14.761 --> 00:47:16.890
<v Speaker 1>and we built cities that people can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>walk and bicycle around,</v>

1155
00:47:16.891 --> 00:47:18.810
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're really stressed all the time</v>

1156
00:47:18.811 --> 00:47:21.390
<v Speaker 1>and they get home from work exhausted so</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't have time to exercise a lot</v>

1157
00:47:21.391 --> 00:47:24.930
<v Speaker 1>of them in that context.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people will do what's the stomach</v>

1158
00:47:24.931 --> 00:47:25.950
<v Speaker 1>stapling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>liposuction,</v>

1159
00:47:25.951 --> 00:47:29.440
<v Speaker 1>that kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right now I'm not against that.</v>

1160
00:47:29.620 --> 00:47:29.980
<v Speaker 1>But</v>

1161
00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:33.340
<v Speaker 2>if we change the society in the way that</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would want to with obesity so that</v>

1162
00:47:33.341 --> 00:47:37.450
<v Speaker 2>people could walk and cycle and you know</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had access to healthy food,</v>

1163
00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:40.630
<v Speaker 2>far fewer people would need stomach</v>
<v Speaker 2>stapling or liposuction.</v>

1164
00:47:40.631 --> 00:47:41.810
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I would drugs,</v>

1165
00:47:41.830 --> 00:47:44.650
<v Speaker 2>not a perfect analogy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I would say is if the social changes</v>

1166
00:47:44.651 --> 00:47:47.740
<v Speaker 2>that I want to happen happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we followed the places that have</v>

1167
00:47:47.741 --> 00:47:51.010
<v Speaker 2>succeeded in reducing depression and</v>
<v Speaker 2>anxiety over time,</v>

1168
00:47:51.011 --> 00:47:53.260
<v Speaker 2>you would see fewer people feeling they</v>
<v Speaker 2>needed.</v>

1169
00:47:53.470 --> 00:47:57.670
<v Speaker 2>And chemical antidepressants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you read it with a couple of things.</v>

1170
00:47:57.671 --> 00:47:59.530
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's access to healthy</v>

1171
00:47:59.531 --> 00:48:01.960
<v Speaker 2>food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think most people have access to</v>

1172
00:48:01.961 --> 00:48:03.580
<v Speaker 2>healthy food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They choose not to eat it.</v>

1173
00:48:03.880 --> 00:48:06.640
<v Speaker 2>They choose to eat refined</v>
<v Speaker 2>carbohydrates,</v>

1174
00:48:06.670 --> 00:48:09.130
<v Speaker 2>high sugar foods,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fast food.</v>

1175
00:48:09.280 --> 00:48:10.870
<v Speaker 2>Those are the things that are getting</v>
<v Speaker 2>people fat.</v>

1176
00:48:11.320 --> 00:48:14.380
<v Speaker 2>And I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that salad is so outside</v>

1177
00:48:14.381 --> 00:48:15.760
<v Speaker 2>of the reach of the normal person.</v>

1178
00:48:16.150 --> 00:48:18.790
<v Speaker 2>I just don't agree with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think that they make unhealthy</v>

1179
00:48:18.791 --> 00:48:20.620
<v Speaker 2>choices.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's much more low end.</v>

1180
00:48:20.621 --> 00:48:23.150
<v Speaker 2>They get addicted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but people make choices on carbohydrate.</v>

1181
00:48:23.170 --> 00:48:25.420
<v Speaker 2>I understand what you're saying and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>think there's some truth in it,</v>

1182
00:48:25.421 --> 00:48:27.250
<v Speaker 2>but I think people make choices in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>context,</v>

1183
00:48:27.251 --> 00:48:28.001
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1184
00:48:28.001 --> 00:48:29.650
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1185
00:48:29.980 --> 00:48:34.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of my relatives who is very</v>

1186
00:48:34.001 --> 00:48:35.020
<v Speaker 2>overweight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1187
00:48:35.050 --> 00:48:38.800
<v Speaker 2>she's constantly fucking stressed</v>
<v Speaker 2>because she's trying to hold together so</v>

1188
00:48:38.801 --> 00:48:43.060
<v Speaker 2>much and one of the few reliefs in</v>
<v Speaker 2>pleasure she has is to eat too much.</v>

1189
00:48:43.061 --> 00:48:45.820
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And to eat pretty shitty food.</v>

1190
00:48:45.821 --> 00:48:47.770
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not critical of her for that.</v>

1191
00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:51.910
<v Speaker 2>I what I want is to help her change her</v>
<v Speaker 2>life and change the society in which we</v>

1192
00:48:51.911 --> 00:48:54.530
<v Speaker 2>live.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So she's not got that constant stress.</v>

1193
00:48:54.531 --> 00:48:55.400
<v Speaker 2>Do you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1194
00:48:55.570 --> 00:48:57.190
<v Speaker 2>I think at this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in relation to addiction and you tweeted</v>

1195
00:48:57.191 --> 00:48:58.030
<v Speaker 2>one smart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a Ted talk,</v>

1196
00:48:58.031 --> 00:49:00.940
<v Speaker 2>I gave everything you think you know</v>
<v Speaker 2>about addiction is wrong,</v>

1197
00:49:01.330 --> 00:49:01.760
<v Speaker 2>which approach?</v>

1198
00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:02.593
<v Speaker 2>I'm grateful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

1199
00:49:02.600 --> 00:49:04.180
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] which is based on my</v>
<v Speaker 2>previous,</v>

1200
00:49:04.480 --> 00:49:06.310
<v Speaker 2>partly taken from my previous book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>chasing the scream,</v>

1201
00:49:06.311 --> 00:49:08.800
<v Speaker 2>which is about addiction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think about what you're saying in</v>

1202
00:49:08.801 --> 00:49:11.410
<v Speaker 2>relation to that context.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we had a lot of addiction in my</v>

1203
00:49:11.411 --> 00:49:12.310
<v Speaker 2>family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1204
00:49:12.670 --> 00:49:14.320
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1205
00:49:14.510 --> 00:49:15.910
<v Speaker 2>one thing that really changed my mind</v>
<v Speaker 2>about this,</v>

1206
00:49:15.911 --> 00:49:19.450
<v Speaker 2>and I think it really relates to what</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're saying about food is most people</v>

1207
00:49:19.451 --> 00:49:20.590
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1208
00:49:20.620 --> 00:49:22.630
<v Speaker 2>addiction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is a drug addiction.</v>

1209
00:49:22.631 --> 00:49:23.650
<v Speaker 2>I say heroin addiction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1210
00:49:23.680 --> 00:49:26.890
<v Speaker 2>Which is very close to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most with the heroin addiction.</v>

1211
00:49:26.920 --> 00:49:28.270
<v Speaker 2>If said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what causes heroin addiction,</v>

1212
00:49:28.271 --> 00:49:31.300
<v Speaker 2>they'd say Dark Heroin Causes Heroin</v>
<v Speaker 2>Addiction,</v>

1213
00:49:31.301 --> 00:49:33.160
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've been told this story for a really</v>

1214
00:49:33.161 --> 00:49:35.080
<v Speaker 2>long time that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1215
00:49:35.260 --> 00:49:36.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you took,</v>

1216
00:49:36.940 --> 00:49:39.430
<v Speaker 2>if we kidnapped someone off the street,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we injected them all.</v>

1217
00:49:39.490 --> 00:49:41.740
<v Speaker 2>We injected them with heroin every day</v>
<v Speaker 2>for 20 days.</v>

1218
00:49:41.950 --> 00:49:43.840
<v Speaker 2>At the end of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'd have this desperate physical</v>

1219
00:49:43.841 --> 00:49:45.760
<v Speaker 2>hunger for the chemical hooks in heroin.</v>

1220
00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:48.500
<v Speaker 2>Their body would desperately need it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's,</v>

1221
00:49:48.530 --> 00:49:50.680
<v Speaker 2>that's why they would be addicted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1222
00:49:51.180 --> 00:49:52.110
<v Speaker 2>First thing that alerts him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

1223
00:49:52.120 --> 00:49:54.850
<v Speaker 2>something not right about that is when</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was explained to me in Britain,</v>

1224
00:49:55.270 --> 00:49:58.600
<v Speaker 2>if you get hit by a truck and you know</v>
<v Speaker 2>your break your hip and you're taken to</v>

1225
00:49:58.601 --> 00:50:00.970
<v Speaker 2>a hospital,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll be given loads of a drug called</v>

1226
00:50:00.971 --> 00:50:01.990
<v Speaker 2>diamorphine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1227
00:50:01.991 --> 00:50:05.740
<v Speaker 2>For the pain diamorphine is heroin is</v>
<v Speaker 2>much better than street heroin because</v>

1228
00:50:05.741 --> 00:50:06.850
<v Speaker 2>it's medically pure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1229
00:50:07.090 --> 00:50:10.180
<v Speaker 2>If anyone listening to this as a British</v>
<v Speaker 2>grandmother who had a hip replacement</v>

1230
00:50:10.181 --> 00:50:12.090
<v Speaker 2>operation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your grandmother's taken a lot of</v>

1231
00:50:12.091 --> 00:50:12.924
<v Speaker 2>heroin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1232
00:50:13.210 --> 00:50:16.030
<v Speaker 2>If what we've been told about the</v>
<v Speaker 2>chemical hooks is right,</v>

1233
00:50:16.330 --> 00:50:18.310
<v Speaker 2>what should be happening to all these</v>
<v Speaker 2>people in hospital?</v>

1234
00:50:18.670 --> 00:50:20.320
<v Speaker 2>Loads of them should be becoming</v>
<v Speaker 2>addicted.</v>

1235
00:50:20.500 --> 00:50:23.250
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't happen in Britain with with</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who are given Domo theme,</v>

1236
00:50:23.450 --> 00:50:24.131
<v Speaker 2>so it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1237
00:50:24.131 --> 00:50:24.910
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's going on?</v>

1238
00:50:24.910 --> 00:50:27.920
<v Speaker 2>I only began to understand it when I</v>
<v Speaker 2>went to Vancouver and needs to be this</v>

1239
00:50:27.921 --> 00:50:30.470
<v Speaker 2>incredible professor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're called Bruce Alexander did this</v>

1240
00:50:30.471 --> 00:50:32.150
<v Speaker 2>experiment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's changed how we think about</v>

1241
00:50:32.151 --> 00:50:34.280
<v Speaker 2>addiction I think is very relevant to</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you're saying about food.</v>

1242
00:50:34.640 --> 00:50:36.920
<v Speaker 2>So this theory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the chemical hooks,</v>

1243
00:50:36.921 --> 00:50:38.300
<v Speaker 2>theory of addiction and chemical hooks</v>
<v Speaker 2>are real.</v>

1244
00:50:38.301 --> 00:50:39.890
<v Speaker 2>They're just a small part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Chemical Hooks,</v>

1245
00:50:39.891 --> 00:50:43.580
<v Speaker 2>theory of addiction comes from a series</v>
<v Speaker 2>of experiments that were done years ago.</v>

1246
00:50:44.300 --> 00:50:46.280
<v Speaker 2>They're really simple.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You take a rat,</v>

1247
00:50:46.580 --> 00:50:49.280
<v Speaker 2>you put it in a cage and you give it two</v>
<v Speaker 2>water bottles.</v>

1248
00:50:49.520 --> 00:50:51.860
<v Speaker 2>One is just water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other is water laced with either</v>

1249
00:50:51.861 --> 00:50:54.140
<v Speaker 2>heroin or cocaine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you do that,</v>

1250
00:50:54.141 --> 00:50:57.170
<v Speaker 2>the rat will almost always prefer the</v>
<v Speaker 2>drug water and almost always die quite</v>

1251
00:50:57.171 --> 00:50:58.640
<v Speaker 2>quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right within think is a week.</v>

1252
00:50:58.880 --> 00:51:00.110
<v Speaker 2>So there you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might remember his famous</v>

1253
00:51:00.111 --> 00:51:02.990
<v Speaker 2>advertisement for from the 80s so there</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go.</v>

1254
00:51:02.990 --> 00:51:03.830
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's our story.</v>

1255
00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:06.200
<v Speaker 2>But in the 70s professor Alexander came</v>
<v Speaker 2>along,</v>

1256
00:51:07.010 --> 00:51:07.880
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well hang on a minute,</v>

1257
00:51:08.870 --> 00:51:12.410
<v Speaker 2>you put the rat alone in an empty cage</v>
<v Speaker 2>or it's got nothing to do except use</v>

1258
00:51:12.411 --> 00:51:14.360
<v Speaker 2>these drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What would happen if we did this</v>

1259
00:51:14.361 --> 00:51:16.760
<v Speaker 2>differently?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he built a cage that he called rat</v>

1260
00:51:16.761 --> 00:51:18.980
<v Speaker 2>park,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is basically like having verace,</v>

1261
00:51:18.981 --> 00:51:19.790
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can,</v>

1262
00:51:19.790 --> 00:51:21.650
<v Speaker 2>they've got loads of friends that can</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck all the time.</v>

1263
00:51:21.651 --> 00:51:25.550
<v Speaker 2>They'd got a grain they like and colored</v>
<v Speaker 2>balls and they've got both the water</v>

1264
00:51:25.551 --> 00:51:27.320
<v Speaker 2>bottles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the normal water and the drug water.</v>

1265
00:51:27.530 --> 00:51:29.210
<v Speaker 2>But the fascinating thing is in rat</v>
<v Speaker 2>park,</v>

1266
00:51:29.420 --> 00:51:31.010
<v Speaker 2>they don't like the drug water that</v>
<v Speaker 2>much.</v>

1267
00:51:31.190 --> 00:51:32.070
<v Speaker 2>None of them used it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cut.</v>

1268
00:51:32.090 --> 00:51:32.990
<v Speaker 2>Some of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they do use it,</v>

1269
00:51:32.991 --> 00:51:36.080
<v Speaker 2>but none of them used it compulsively</v>
<v Speaker 2>and none of them ever overdose.</v>

1270
00:51:36.230 --> 00:51:38.570
<v Speaker 2>So when they deprived of the things that</v>
<v Speaker 2>make life meaningful,</v>

1271
00:51:38.690 --> 00:51:40.100
<v Speaker 2>they turn obsessive Lee to the drug.</v>

1272
00:51:40.100 --> 00:51:42.200
<v Speaker 2>When they've got the things that make</v>
<v Speaker 2>life meaningful per rats,</v>

1273
00:51:42.440 --> 00:51:43.970
<v Speaker 2>they don't the opposite of addiction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>

1274
00:51:43.971 --> 00:51:46.070
<v Speaker 2>Sobriety?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The opposite of addiction is connection.</v>

1275
00:51:46.190 --> 00:51:48.260
<v Speaker 2>I think you can see similar principle</v>
<v Speaker 2>playing out with food,</v>

1276
00:51:48.261 --> 00:51:49.910
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course there's some margin to the</v>

1277
00:51:49.911 --> 00:51:51.050
<v Speaker 2>individual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to say that we're,</v>

1278
00:51:51.260 --> 00:51:55.610
<v Speaker 2>we're not entirely the [inaudible] for</v>
<v Speaker 2>reasonably far away from this woman,</v>

1279
00:51:55.690 --> 00:51:57.920
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these people that were on this dire</v>

1280
00:51:57.921 --> 00:52:00.320
<v Speaker 2>morphine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So why are you saying that they don't</v>

1281
00:52:00.321 --> 00:52:03.080
<v Speaker 2>get addicted to it because they go back</v>
<v Speaker 2>to their lives meaningful.</v>

1282
00:52:03.081 --> 00:52:05.360
<v Speaker 2>There's a human example that happened at</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same time as rat park.</v>

1283
00:52:05.760 --> 00:52:09.350
<v Speaker 2>Why are their lives particularly</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaningful in relationship to like the</v>

1284
00:52:09.351 --> 00:52:12.770
<v Speaker 2>lives we're talking about here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think you can see in an example,</v>

1285
00:52:13.220 --> 00:52:14.900
<v Speaker 2>a good example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was happening at the same time as rat</v>

1286
00:52:14.901 --> 00:52:16.310
<v Speaker 2>park and experiment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Vietnam War,</v>

1287
00:52:16.340 --> 00:52:17.060
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1288
00:52:17.060 --> 00:52:19.160
<v Speaker 2>Huge numbers of American troops in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Vietnam.</v>

1289
00:52:19.161 --> 00:52:21.150
<v Speaker 2>About 40% used heroin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1290
00:52:21.590 --> 00:52:24.020
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you look at the reports from the</v>

1291
00:52:24.021 --> 00:52:25.910
<v Speaker 2>time they were shitting themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause they were like,</v>

1292
00:52:25.911 --> 00:52:27.170
<v Speaker 2>my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the war ends,</v>

1293
00:52:27.560 --> 00:52:30.200
<v Speaker 2>we're going to have all these heroin</v>
<v Speaker 2>addicts on the streets of the United</v>

1294
00:52:30.200 --> 00:52:30.891
<v Speaker 2>States.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to come home.</v>

1295
00:52:30.891 --> 00:52:33.020
<v Speaker 2>And because they believe the chemical</v>
<v Speaker 2>hooks theory,</v>

1296
00:52:33.260 --> 00:52:36.830
<v Speaker 2>it's a really good study in the Archives</v>
<v Speaker 2>of General Psychiatry by Professor Lee</v>

1297
00:52:36.830 --> 00:52:39.320
<v Speaker 2>Robbins that followed these guys hope,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my select group of them.</v>

1298
00:52:40.040 --> 00:52:43.580
<v Speaker 2>And what it found was at 95% of them</v>
<v Speaker 2>just stopped,</v>

1299
00:52:43.850 --> 00:52:46.520
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It didn't go into some catastrophic</v>

1300
00:52:46.550 --> 00:52:47.960
<v Speaker 2>withdraw.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of them did experience some</v>

1301
00:52:47.961 --> 00:52:50.090
<v Speaker 2>physical discomfort,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they didn't.</v>

1302
00:52:50.120 --> 00:52:50.953
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they didn't.</v>

1303
00:52:51.470 --> 00:52:53.180
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you believe the old theory of</v>

1304
00:52:53.181 --> 00:52:55.250
<v Speaker 2>addiction that you're taken over by the</v>
<v Speaker 2>chemical hooks,</v>

1305
00:52:55.251 --> 00:52:56.270
<v Speaker 2>that makes no sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1306
00:52:56.600 --> 00:53:00.050
<v Speaker 2>But they've been exposed to all the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>chemical hooks as any homeless street,</v>

1307
00:53:00.470 --> 00:53:02.630
<v Speaker 2>street addicted person to be on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>streets.</v>

1308
00:53:03.070 --> 00:53:05.150
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you understand this different way</v>

1309
00:53:05.151 --> 00:53:06.170
<v Speaker 2>of thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it makes perfect sense.</v>

1310
00:53:06.171 --> 00:53:10.640
<v Speaker 2>If you took you and me now and put us in</v>
<v Speaker 2>a hellish pestilential jungle where we</v>

1311
00:53:10.641 --> 00:53:12.650
<v Speaker 2>don't want to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we could die at any moment.</v>

1312
00:53:12.651 --> 00:53:14.930
<v Speaker 2>We'd be made to kill people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You would definitely survive longer than</v>

1313
00:53:14.931 --> 00:53:17.570
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we were both find heroin a lot more</v>

1314
00:53:17.571 --> 00:53:18.950
<v Speaker 2>appealing than we do now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1315
00:53:19.130 --> 00:53:22.100
<v Speaker 2>And then when we come back to our lives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we have meaning and purpose,</v>

1316
00:53:22.520 --> 00:53:24.410
<v Speaker 2>we would find heroin a lot less</v>
<v Speaker 2>appealing.</v>

1317
00:53:24.560 --> 00:53:26.010
<v Speaker 2>The core of addiction is not wanting</v>

1318
00:53:26.010 --> 00:53:29.160
<v Speaker 1>to be present in your life because your</v>
<v Speaker 1>life is too painful place to be.</v>

1319
00:53:29.250 --> 00:53:31.830
<v Speaker 1>So when something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an intervention happens that reduces the</v>

1320
00:53:31.831 --> 00:53:34.710
<v Speaker 1>amount of pain in your life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could be less addicted.</v>

1321
00:53:34.980 --> 00:53:36.660
<v Speaker 1>There's a very challenging,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Marianne faithful,</v>

1322
00:53:36.661 --> 00:53:39.060
<v Speaker 1>you know the British rocks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was to stop you right there because</v>

1323
00:53:39.061 --> 00:53:43.050
<v Speaker 1>there is a giant issue though with</v>
<v Speaker 1>people taking pain pills after</v>

1324
00:53:43.051 --> 00:53:45.630
<v Speaker 1>operations that weren't on pain pills</v>
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>

1325
00:53:45.690 --> 00:53:49.830
<v Speaker 1>And then they get addicted to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's because a lack of meaning in</v>

1326
00:53:49.831 --> 00:53:53.100
<v Speaker 1>their life or is it because there is an</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolute real chemical hook?</v>

1327
00:53:53.310 --> 00:53:55.350
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a good friend who had his nose</v>

1328
00:53:55.470 --> 00:53:59.220
<v Speaker 1>broken and a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they fixed his nose and he got on some,</v>

1329
00:53:59.580 --> 00:54:03.120
<v Speaker 1>I think it was oxycontin afterwards they</v>
<v Speaker 1>prescribed to them and then four months</v>

1330
00:54:03.121 --> 00:54:04.890
<v Speaker 1>later he's taking it every day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all day.</v>

1331
00:54:05.130 --> 00:54:06.480
<v Speaker 1>So there's a few things about that.</v>

1332
00:54:06.480 --> 00:54:07.680
<v Speaker 1>Firstly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chemical hooks are real,</v>

1333
00:54:07.681 --> 00:54:09.900
<v Speaker 1>but they're a small part of the picture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know how much they are.</v>

1334
00:54:09.901 --> 00:54:12.480
<v Speaker 1>So this experiments that measure this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we,</v>

1335
00:54:12.481 --> 00:54:13.890
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lots of people want to take him.</v>

1336
00:54:14.010 --> 00:54:15.270
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people listening to this will be</v>

1337
00:54:15.271 --> 00:54:18.930
<v Speaker 1>taking part in this experiment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now when nicotine patches were invented</v>

1338
00:54:18.931 --> 00:54:21.810
<v Speaker 1>in the late eighties and they become</v>
<v Speaker 1>marketed in the early nineties,</v>

1339
00:54:22.140 --> 00:54:24.060
<v Speaker 1>there's this huge wave of optimism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1340
00:54:24.240 --> 00:54:26.940
<v Speaker 1>Cause the chemical hook in cigarettes is</v>
<v Speaker 1>nicotine.</v>

1341
00:54:27.570 --> 00:54:30.090
<v Speaker 1>Nicotine patches give Ya the chemical</v>
<v Speaker 1>hook you're addicted to.</v>

1342
00:54:30.740 --> 00:54:32.430
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so there was this huge,</v>

1343
00:54:32.431 --> 00:54:32.640
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

1344
00:54:32.640 --> 00:54:33.151
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great,</v>

1345
00:54:33.151 --> 00:54:34.560
<v Speaker 1>we're going to give people the camp</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's,</v>

1346
00:54:34.620 --> 00:54:37.020
<v Speaker 1>the diction is caused by chemical hooks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to give them the chemical</v>

1347
00:54:37.021 --> 00:54:39.840
<v Speaker 1>hook.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll stop wanting these filthy smoke</v>

1348
00:54:40.470 --> 00:54:41.850
<v Speaker 1>smoking's going to end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1349
00:54:42.310 --> 00:54:45.780
<v Speaker 1>And in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happened is 17% of people,</v>

1350
00:54:45.781 --> 00:54:47.580
<v Speaker 1>according to the US surgeon general's</v>
<v Speaker 1>report,</v>

1351
00:54:47.880 --> 00:54:50.380
<v Speaker 1>when they take nicotine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>use nicotine patches and they're</v>

1352
00:54:50.381 --> 00:54:51.450
<v Speaker 1>motivated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stop smoking.</v>

1353
00:54:51.450 --> 00:54:53.710
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really important to say 17% is not.</v>

1354
00:54:53.730 --> 00:54:57.100
<v Speaker 1>No one big number that has saved</v>
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of thousands of people's lives</v>

1355
00:54:57.101 --> 00:55:00.480
<v Speaker 1>at a conservative estimate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but still leaves 83% where something</v>

1356
00:55:00.481 --> 00:55:01.291
<v Speaker 1>else is going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1357
00:55:01.291 --> 00:55:02.970
<v Speaker 1>But isn't that because of the delivery</v>
<v Speaker 1>method?</v>

1358
00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:05.810
<v Speaker 1>The digital delivery method of</v>
<v Speaker 1>cigarettes is incredibly satisfying.</v>

1359
00:55:05.830 --> 00:55:08.340
<v Speaker 1>You take a hit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get it right into your system and</v>

1360
00:55:08.341 --> 00:55:09.870
<v Speaker 1>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get that nicotine,</v>

1361
00:55:10.320 --> 00:55:13.230
<v Speaker 1>their transdermal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very slow.</v>

1362
00:55:13.500 --> 00:55:15.000
<v Speaker 1>It's not the same feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1363
00:55:15.001 --> 00:55:17.610
<v Speaker 1>there are there experiments that show</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is pleasure that comes from the</v>

1364
00:55:17.611 --> 00:55:19.650
<v Speaker 1>delivery method,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also about self soothing.</v>

1365
00:55:19.651 --> 00:55:21.570
<v Speaker 1>It's about anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about boredom.</v>

1366
00:55:21.910 --> 00:55:23.580
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is very important to relate to</v>

1367
00:55:23.581 --> 00:55:26.670
<v Speaker 1>the opiate crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one in 130,</v>

1368
00:55:26.980 --> 00:55:28.950
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>opioid prescriptions resulted in</v>

1369
00:55:28.980 --> 00:55:29.813
<v Speaker 1>addiction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1370
00:55:29.940 --> 00:55:32.460
<v Speaker 1>So it's a small number,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at catastrophic and devastating</v>

1371
00:55:32.461 --> 00:55:33.930
<v Speaker 1>number.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I reported from the places that have</v>

1372
00:55:33.931 --> 00:55:37.080
<v Speaker 1>been most affected like this by this</v>
<v Speaker 1>like keene in New Hampshire.</v>

1373
00:55:37.110 --> 00:55:40.290
<v Speaker 1>One in what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one in 130 if the users become addicted.</v>

1374
00:55:40.320 --> 00:55:41.400
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1375
00:55:41.490 --> 00:55:45.450
<v Speaker 1>It's a relatively small proportion now</v>
<v Speaker 1>that cause so many people in the country</v>

1376
00:55:45.451 --> 00:55:46.560
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1377
00:55:46.561 --> 00:55:48.050
<v Speaker 1>I can send you the study.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the,</v>

1378
00:55:48.051 --> 00:55:51.190
<v Speaker 1>the best studies that got that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's in the United States or in</v>

1379
00:55:51.191 --> 00:55:52.500
<v Speaker 1>the UK,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the United States.</v>

1380
00:55:52.680 --> 00:55:54.450
<v Speaker 1>We've got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one in 130 prescriptions.</v>

1381
00:55:54.451 --> 00:55:56.820
<v Speaker 1>But bear in mind that some people get</v>
<v Speaker 1>more than one prescription.</v>

1382
00:55:56.821 --> 00:55:57.654
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1383
00:55:57.870 --> 00:55:58.703
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1384
00:55:59.070 --> 00:56:00.930
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one of the things that's really</v>

1385
00:56:00.931 --> 00:56:04.590
<v Speaker 1>important to understand about that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the context in which this is happening,</v>

1386
00:56:04.591 --> 00:56:06.260
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Britain in the 18th.</v>

1387
00:56:06.270 --> 00:56:09.360
<v Speaker 1>And this totally relates to what I write</v>
<v Speaker 1>about in lost connections about</v>

1388
00:56:09.361 --> 00:56:13.080
<v Speaker 1>depression as well as in chasing the</v>
<v Speaker 1>scream about addiction in Britain in the</v>

1389
00:56:13.081 --> 00:56:15.240
<v Speaker 1>18th century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was this thing that happened</v>

1390
00:56:15.241 --> 00:56:16.770
<v Speaker 1>called the gin craze,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1391
00:56:17.160 --> 00:56:22.140
<v Speaker 1>So huge numbers of people are driven out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the countryside into these disgusting</v>

1392
00:56:22.200 --> 00:56:24.130
<v Speaker 1>urban slums where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you</v>

1393
00:56:24.130 --> 00:56:25.330
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're living in this office,</v>

1394
00:56:25.360 --> 00:56:27.250
<v Speaker 2>they've lost everything that made like</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaningful to them.</v>

1395
00:56:27.251 --> 00:56:29.560
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what happened was an outbreak of</v>

1396
00:56:29.561 --> 00:56:31.570
<v Speaker 2>mass alcoholism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>huge outbreak.</v>

1397
00:56:31.571 --> 00:56:34.750
<v Speaker 2>It's called the gin craze.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's famous paintings of like a woman</v>

1398
00:56:34.751 --> 00:56:37.060
<v Speaker 2>drinking a bottle of gin while her baby</v>
<v Speaker 2>falls out a window,</v>

1399
00:56:37.061 --> 00:56:37.990
<v Speaker 2>that kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1400
00:56:38.140 --> 00:56:41.050
<v Speaker 2>And it really happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and at the time what people said is,</v>

1401
00:56:41.380 --> 00:56:44.620
<v Speaker 2>look at this evil drug gin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at what it's done to people.</v>

1402
00:56:44.710 --> 00:56:47.920
<v Speaker 2>If only we could get rid of these evil</v>
<v Speaker 2>people selling this evil drug gin,</v>

1403
00:56:48.160 --> 00:56:50.740
<v Speaker 2>this problem would go away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now when we look back at it,</v>

1404
00:56:50.741 --> 00:56:51.910
<v Speaker 2>we know that can't have been because of</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jim,</v>

1405
00:56:51.911 --> 00:56:54.370
<v Speaker 2>because we could both have jen in these</v>
<v Speaker 2>glasses.</v>

1406
00:56:54.371 --> 00:56:57.250
<v Speaker 2>Now anyone in Britain can go and buy gin</v>
<v Speaker 2>at any point,</v>

1407
00:56:57.251 --> 00:57:00.040
<v Speaker 2>pretty much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if they're an adult and we don't</v>

1408
00:57:00.041 --> 00:57:01.450
<v Speaker 2>have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's still some alcoholism.</v>

1409
00:57:01.450 --> 00:57:03.860
<v Speaker 2>Of course there was some despair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1410
00:57:03.930 --> 00:57:06.430
<v Speaker 2>it's caused a lot changed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not the availability of the drug.</v>

1411
00:57:06.431 --> 00:57:08.260
<v Speaker 2>What changes the amount of pain in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>society.</v>

1412
00:57:08.530 --> 00:57:11.500
<v Speaker 2>And that is the key factor that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>playing out here with opioids,</v>

1413
00:57:11.501 --> 00:57:13.000
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not the only factor.</v>

1414
00:57:13.001 --> 00:57:14.560
<v Speaker 2>Chemical Hooks are real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1415
00:57:14.570 --> 00:57:16.810
<v Speaker 2>I'm a Brazilian guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was absolutely adamant that,</v>

1416
00:57:16.811 --> 00:57:17.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

1417
00:57:17.960 --> 00:57:20.380
<v Speaker 2>he become medically addicted was an</v>
<v Speaker 2>accidental chemical.</v>

1418
00:57:20.381 --> 00:57:23.020
<v Speaker 2>Hooks are taken him over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He'd been a college athlete.</v>

1419
00:57:23.110 --> 00:57:26.080
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was in a particular about 21 he</v>

1420
00:57:26.120 --> 00:57:28.680
<v Speaker 2>was in a terrible car accident and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>get a,</v>

1421
00:57:28.690 --> 00:57:31.090
<v Speaker 2>and they gave him loads of opioids and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it became a doctor.</v>

1422
00:57:31.100 --> 00:57:31.661
<v Speaker 2>But then I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1423
00:57:31.661 --> 00:57:33.840
<v Speaker 2>tell me about what's going well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's going on today.</v>

1424
00:57:33.860 --> 00:57:35.230
<v Speaker 2>He couldn't be a college athlete</v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>

1425
00:57:35.340 --> 00:57:38.320
<v Speaker 2>It's a whole life had been built around</v>
<v Speaker 2>being an athlete and because of his</v>

1426
00:57:38.321 --> 00:57:40.300
<v Speaker 2>injuries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he couldn't become an athlete anymore.</v>

1427
00:57:40.600 --> 00:57:41.770
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well do you think it might have been</v>

1428
00:57:41.771 --> 00:57:45.310
<v Speaker 2>related also to the despair around that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't take long for people.</v>

1429
00:57:45.460 --> 00:57:47.800
<v Speaker 2>I think part of the promise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because we've got such stigma about</v>

1430
00:57:47.860 --> 00:57:49.060
<v Speaker 2>depression,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anxiety,</v>

1431
00:57:49.061 --> 00:57:52.120
<v Speaker 2>addiction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people will latch onto the biological</v>

1432
00:57:52.121 --> 00:57:54.610
<v Speaker 2>explanation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's the chemical imbalance</v>

1433
00:57:54.611 --> 00:57:58.210
<v Speaker 2>theory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the chemical hooks theory as their path</v>

1434
00:57:58.211 --> 00:57:58.991
<v Speaker 2>out of stigma.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where's,</v>

1435
00:57:58.991 --> 00:58:00.490
<v Speaker 2>to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you shouldn't be stigmatized in any</v>

1436
00:58:00.491 --> 00:58:02.740
<v Speaker 2>fucking circumstance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's because you're in pain,</v>

1437
00:58:03.040 --> 00:58:05.200
<v Speaker 2>psychological pain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>physical pain.</v>

1438
00:58:05.230 --> 00:58:07.420
<v Speaker 2>Did you see the point I'm making?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think one of the reasons why we're</v>

1439
00:58:07.421 --> 00:58:09.640
<v Speaker 2>so committed to this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's not even a good way out of</v>

1440
00:58:09.641 --> 00:58:11.140
<v Speaker 2>stigma.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can explain to you happy ones are</v>

1441
00:58:11.141 --> 00:58:13.390
<v Speaker 2>interesting evidence about that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but did you see the point?</v>

1442
00:58:13.391 --> 00:58:14.224
<v Speaker 2>I'm making job.</v>

1443
00:58:14.500 --> 00:58:17.950
<v Speaker 3>I do see the point that you're making</v>
<v Speaker 3>that people with lives that are</v>

1444
00:58:17.951 --> 00:58:22.120
<v Speaker 3>unsatisfying or unfulfilling or there's</v>
<v Speaker 3>some sort of a major issue in their,</v>

1445
00:58:22.121 --> 00:58:25.090
<v Speaker 3>like the athlete that's no longer going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be able to be an athlete,</v>

1446
00:58:25.390 --> 00:58:29.290
<v Speaker 3>that that's going to make these drugs</v>
<v Speaker 3>more enticing.</v>

1447
00:58:29.980 --> 00:58:32.170
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I know too many people that have had</v>

1448
00:58:32.171 --> 00:58:35.830
<v Speaker 3>like real issues getting off of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like physical issues.</v>

1449
00:58:36.030 --> 00:58:38.470
<v Speaker 3>We're no one to painful for withdrawals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course.</v>

1450
00:58:38.530 --> 00:58:41.110
<v Speaker 3>And most people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you're talking about the same</v>

1451
00:58:41.111 --> 00:58:43.810
<v Speaker 3>people that have a hard time not eating</v>
<v Speaker 3>shitty food,</v>

1452
00:58:43.811 --> 00:58:46.390
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have people that have a hard time</v>

1453
00:58:46.420 --> 00:58:48.520
<v Speaker 3>getting disciplined enough to go to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>gym.</v>

1454
00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:51.610
<v Speaker 3>These are the same kind of people we're</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about.</v>

1455
00:58:51.611 --> 00:58:55.720
<v Speaker 3>They're going to have a massive problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you give them pills and those pills</v>

1456
00:58:55.721 --> 00:58:59.050
<v Speaker 3>create a chemical hook,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if it's a chemical hook that you or</v>

1457
00:58:59.051 --> 00:59:02.020
<v Speaker 3>I or a discipline person would be able</v>
<v Speaker 3>to get.</v>

1458
00:59:02.021 --> 00:59:04.930
<v Speaker 3>Like Dr. Carl Hart famously called it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>

1459
00:59:04.931 --> 00:59:06.580
<v Speaker 3>it's like getting over the flu.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

1460
00:59:06.581 --> 00:59:08.500
<v Speaker 3>that's what heroin is like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone wants to pretend that you're</v>

1461
00:59:08.501 --> 00:59:09.131
<v Speaker 3>going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

1462
00:59:09.131 --> 00:59:10.750
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you feel like shit for a little while</v>

1463
00:59:10.870 --> 00:59:12.160
<v Speaker 3>and then you're fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

1464
00:59:12.161 --> 00:59:15.310
<v Speaker 3>it's not the thing that everybody makes</v>
<v Speaker 3>it out to be withdrawals or not the</v>

1465
00:59:15.311 --> 00:59:16.720
<v Speaker 3>thing that everybody makes it out to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

1466
00:59:17.020 --> 00:59:21.410
<v Speaker 3>but if you have the average person and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you give them pills and those pills can</v>

1467
00:59:21.411 --> 00:59:22.010
<v Speaker 3>keep them</v>

1468
00:59:22.010 --> 00:59:24.830
<v Speaker 2>from getting the flu,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to keep taking those</v>

1469
00:59:24.831 --> 00:59:26.540
<v Speaker 2>pills.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if they stop taking those pills,</v>

1470
00:59:26.541 --> 00:59:28.580
<v Speaker 2>they get the flu.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are comfort,</v>

1471
00:59:28.581 --> 00:59:31.850
<v Speaker 2>jumpy junkies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think it's does too simplistic.</v>

1472
00:59:31.880 --> 00:59:32.990
<v Speaker 2>I think there's some truth in what</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're saying,</v>

1473
00:59:33.020 --> 00:59:37.190
<v Speaker 2>but I think the key thing that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I think doctor to is t who's a friend</v>

1474
00:59:37.191 --> 00:59:38.380
<v Speaker 2>of mine is totally right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>

1475
00:59:38.381 --> 00:59:41.510
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the physical withdrawal is,</v>

1476
00:59:41.570 --> 00:59:43.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a flu is not a nice thing,</v>

1477
00:59:43.041 --> 00:59:44.660
<v Speaker 2>but it's not the most onerous thing in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>

1478
00:59:44.990 --> 00:59:48.530
<v Speaker 2>But the thing that's really devastating</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the resumption of the pain that you</v>

1479
00:59:48.531 --> 00:59:50.150
<v Speaker 2>were in east,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that psychological pain that you were</v>

1480
00:59:50.151 --> 00:59:51.950
<v Speaker 2>nice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The timing with the drug,</v>

1481
00:59:51.951 --> 00:59:52.690
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1482
00:59:52.690 --> 00:59:55.070
<v Speaker 2>Do you want to understand why people are</v>
<v Speaker 2>taking so many painkillers?</v>

1483
00:59:55.071 --> 00:59:56.870
<v Speaker 2>We've got to understand why they're in</v>
<v Speaker 2>so much pain.</v>

1484
00:59:57.080 --> 01:00:00.040
<v Speaker 2>And that comes back to the nine causes</v>
<v Speaker 2>of depression and anxiety that arrived</v>

1485
01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:03.230
<v Speaker 2>in las connections and then the kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>seven solutions to this problem that I</v>

1486
01:00:03.231 --> 01:00:03.980
<v Speaker 2>offer.</v>

1487
01:00:03.980 --> 01:00:05.900
<v Speaker 2>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's about if are,</v>

1488
01:00:05.990 --> 01:00:07.820
<v Speaker 2>so let's say Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1489
01:00:07.850 --> 01:00:09.680
<v Speaker 2>Joe In the paint store who I was talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

1490
01:00:09.681 --> 01:00:10.514
<v Speaker 2>who's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1491
01:00:10.580 --> 01:00:15.580
<v Speaker 2>he who has this job he can't bear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has very little a meaning in his life,</v>

1492
01:00:15.621 --> 01:00:17.540
<v Speaker 2>feels his life is just slipping through</v>
<v Speaker 2>his fingers.</v>

1493
01:00:17.780 --> 01:00:20.690
<v Speaker 2>He took oxy for quite a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He actually contacted me because of my,</v>

1494
01:00:20.760 --> 01:00:22.250
<v Speaker 2>my book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1495
01:00:22.340 --> 01:00:23.011
<v Speaker 2>and because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1496
01:00:23.011 --> 01:00:25.730
<v Speaker 2>and my ted talk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he thought he was telling me a story</v>

1497
01:00:25.731 --> 01:00:26.630
<v Speaker 2>about addiction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1498
01:00:26.631 --> 01:00:29.300
<v Speaker 2>But the truth is when he took oxygen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was numbed.</v>

1499
01:00:29.630 --> 01:00:33.140
<v Speaker 2>It made him as numb as the work itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when he stopped,</v>

1500
01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:34.880
<v Speaker 2>he was acutely depressed and felt like</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

1501
01:00:35.060 --> 01:00:38.510
<v Speaker 2>So I think the challenges,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you are coming off of this drug into</v>

1502
01:00:38.511 --> 01:00:42.230
<v Speaker 2>a society of profoundly lonely and</v>
<v Speaker 2>isolated people who are financially</v>

1503
01:00:42.231 --> 01:00:45.500
<v Speaker 2>insecure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who've been told that life is about</v>

1504
01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:47.600
<v Speaker 2>money and status,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>

1505
01:00:47.630 --> 01:00:48.463
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1506
01:00:48.500 --> 01:00:50.120
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who think life is about screaming at</v>

1507
01:00:50.121 --> 01:00:53.300
<v Speaker 2>each other three screens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of those people are gonna feel</v>

1508
01:00:53.301 --> 01:00:54.020
<v Speaker 2>like shit.</v>

1509
01:00:54.020 --> 01:00:55.910
<v Speaker 2>And it's not because they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>individually week,</v>

1510
01:00:55.970 --> 01:00:57.890
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's become that and maybe individual</v>

1511
01:00:57.891 --> 01:00:58.521
<v Speaker 2>witnesses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>

1512
01:00:58.521 --> 01:01:00.590
<v Speaker 2>we all have flaws.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every human being has flaws.</v>

1513
01:01:01.060 --> 01:01:06.060
<v Speaker 2>But I think it's much more because the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fact that it's risen so much tells you</v>

1514
01:01:06.291 --> 01:01:08.600
<v Speaker 2>that it's a response to social changes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1515
01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:11.540
<v Speaker 2>Just like the fact that obesity has</v>
<v Speaker 2>risen so much tells us now there are</v>

1516
01:01:11.590 --> 01:01:14.480
<v Speaker 2>course individual agency.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to infantilize anyone that</v>

1517
01:01:14.481 --> 01:01:17.430
<v Speaker 2>are things individuals can do obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I talk about them a lot in lots</v>

1518
01:01:17.460 --> 01:01:20.030
<v Speaker 2>connections.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think the fact that it's a social</v>

1519
01:01:20.210 --> 01:01:22.100
<v Speaker 2>transformation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1520
01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:24.110
<v Speaker 2>does tell you something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>

1521
01:01:24.150 --> 01:01:26.810
<v Speaker 2>a good illustration of this kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>weird thing that was discovered about</v>

1522
01:01:26.811 --> 01:01:31.010
<v Speaker 2>depression in the 70s that was so</v>
<v Speaker 2>inconvenient that psychiatrist tried to</v>

1523
01:01:31.011 --> 01:01:33.470
<v Speaker 2>brush it under the carpet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in the 70s,</v>

1524
01:01:33.471 --> 01:01:36.110
<v Speaker 2>the American Psychiatric Association for</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first time,</v>

1525
01:01:36.310 --> 01:01:40.190
<v Speaker 2>what it to standardize how depression is</v>
<v Speaker 2>diagnosed across the u s because up to</v>

1526
01:01:40.191 --> 01:01:43.100
<v Speaker 2>then doctors were just using their own</v>
<v Speaker 2>judgment about what it even was.</v>

1527
01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:46.490
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they drew up a list of 10 symptoms,</v>

1528
01:01:46.491 --> 01:01:49.850
<v Speaker 2>kind of obvious things like feeling</v>
<v Speaker 2>worthless cry and a lot,</v>

1529
01:01:49.900 --> 01:01:51.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could guess where they were.</v>

1530
01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:55.550
<v Speaker 2>And they send this out to doctors all</v>
<v Speaker 2>over the US and uh,</v>

1531
01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.370
<v Speaker 2>they use it but a cup of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>within a couple of months.</v>

1532
01:01:58.550 --> 01:01:59.600
<v Speaker 2>Dot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To start to come back and go,</v>

1533
01:01:59.601 --> 01:02:00.434
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've got a real,</v>

1534
01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:04.160
<v Speaker 2>we've got a problem here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because if we just use this checklist,</v>

1535
01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:07.970
<v Speaker 2>we should be diagnosing every grieving</v>
<v Speaker 2>person is mentally ill because these are</v>

1536
01:02:07.971 --> 01:02:09.260
<v Speaker 2>the symptoms of grief,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1537
01:02:09.500 --> 01:02:10.850
<v Speaker 2>Everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you lose someone,</v>

1538
01:02:11.510 --> 01:02:13.250
<v Speaker 2>Cope wants to cry a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fit,</v>

1539
01:02:13.260 --> 01:02:15.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has persistent feelings of sadness,</v>

1540
01:02:15.411 --> 01:02:17.390
<v Speaker 2>that kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like what do we do?</v>

1541
01:02:17.480 --> 01:02:19.320
<v Speaker 2>So the psychiatrist regrouped and were</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1542
01:02:19.321 --> 01:02:20.970
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll create something.</v>

1543
01:02:20.971 --> 01:02:23.640
<v Speaker 2>It was called the grief exception.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Basically sad.</v>

1544
01:02:23.790 --> 01:02:27.390
<v Speaker 2>Use this checklist to diagnose</v>
<v Speaker 2>depression unless the person has lost</v>

1545
01:02:27.391 --> 01:02:30.330
<v Speaker 2>someone they love in the last year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in which case none of this counts.</v>

1546
01:02:30.450 --> 01:02:32.760
<v Speaker 2>So they start using that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But over the next few years that</v>

1547
01:02:32.761 --> 01:02:34.380
<v Speaker 2>followed this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this really awkward debate,</v>

1548
01:02:34.381 --> 01:02:35.220
<v Speaker 2>cause they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute,</v>

1549
01:02:35.670 --> 01:02:39.630
<v Speaker 2>we're being told to tell our patients</v>
<v Speaker 2>that depression is just a brain disease.</v>

1550
01:02:39.750 --> 01:02:41.910
<v Speaker 2>That you can just identify from a</v>
<v Speaker 2>checklist.</v>

1551
01:02:42.690 --> 01:02:46.830
<v Speaker 2>Unless there's one situation in life</v>
<v Speaker 2>where it's perfectly legitimate to react</v>

1552
01:02:46.831 --> 01:02:48.390
<v Speaker 2>this way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But at that begs the question,</v>

1553
01:02:48.840 --> 01:02:51.270
<v Speaker 2>why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why not?</v>

1554
01:02:51.630 --> 01:02:53.010
<v Speaker 2>If you made homeless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why not?</v>

1555
01:02:53.011 --> 01:02:54.660
<v Speaker 2>If you'd stuck in a shitty job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you hey,</v>

1556
01:02:54.870 --> 01:02:56.190
<v Speaker 2>why not?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're really lonely,</v>

1557
01:02:56.340 --> 01:03:00.210
<v Speaker 2>the minute you admit all that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to admit context and that was</v>

1558
01:03:00.211 --> 01:03:02.190
<v Speaker 2>so inconvenient.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just got rid of the grief exception</v>

1559
01:03:02.191 --> 01:03:05.820
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A fascinating fact and that seems to be</v>

1560
01:03:05.860 --> 01:03:10.320
<v Speaker 2>a huge issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That seems to be one of the primary</v>

1561
01:03:10.321 --> 01:03:13.290
<v Speaker 2>reasons why people today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you,</v>

1562
01:03:13.291 --> 01:03:17.670
<v Speaker 2>if you stop and ask the average person</v>
<v Speaker 2>today who's not feeling well,</v>

1563
01:03:18.180 --> 01:03:21.720
<v Speaker 2>I guarantee you they're going to be able</v>
<v Speaker 2>to come up with at least one or two of</v>

1564
01:03:21.721 --> 01:03:26.721
<v Speaker 2>those things on the list that are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are factors who totally right and</v>

1565
01:03:27.811 --> 01:03:28.020
<v Speaker 2>is there.</v>

1566
01:03:28.020 --> 01:03:30.360
<v Speaker 2>It's a job or financial stress,</v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship,</v>

1567
01:03:30.361 --> 01:03:32.070
<v Speaker 2>stress,</v>
<v Speaker 2>loneliness,</v>

1568
01:03:32.130 --> 01:03:36.810
<v Speaker 2>friendship issues or death in the family</v>
<v Speaker 2>or losing someone they love,</v>

1569
01:03:36.980 --> 01:03:38.960
<v Speaker 2>but the fact that losing someone their</v>
<v Speaker 2>love like,</v>

1570
01:03:38.961 --> 01:03:40.140
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll count that.</v>

1571
01:03:40.780 --> 01:03:44.010
<v Speaker 2>That's the one thing that's seems very</v>
<v Speaker 2>preposterous.</v>

1572
01:03:44.070 --> 01:03:47.210
<v Speaker 2>And the woman who did the most research,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is one of the best people I've</v>

1573
01:03:47.211 --> 01:03:49.730
<v Speaker 2>got to know for loss connections when we</v>
<v Speaker 2>could talk to Joanne [inaudible],</v>

1574
01:03:49.731 --> 01:03:53.310
<v Speaker 2>he's an amazing person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She lost her baby in childbirth.</v>

1575
01:03:53.710 --> 01:03:57.000
<v Speaker 2>Babies called Cheyenne and she became an</v>
<v Speaker 2>expert on this and she said,</v>

1576
01:03:57.030 --> 01:03:58.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she talks about the craziness of this.</v>

1577
01:03:58.831 --> 01:04:01.260
<v Speaker 2>It just shows we don't understand pain</v>
<v Speaker 2>in this society.</v>

1578
01:04:01.590 --> 01:04:02.160
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She said,</v>

1579
01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:03.720
<v Speaker 2>she put it to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't,</v>

1580
01:04:03.750 --> 01:04:05.700
<v Speaker 2>grief isn't a pathology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1581
01:04:05.910 --> 01:04:07.650
<v Speaker 2>We don't need cheap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's done this research that shows,</v>

1582
01:04:07.651 --> 01:04:11.850
<v Speaker 2>I think the figure is 32% of grieving</v>
<v Speaker 2>parents are diagnosed and drugs in the</v>

1583
01:04:11.851 --> 01:04:14.560
<v Speaker 2>first 48 hours after their child dies</v>
<v Speaker 2>and she's,</v>

1584
01:04:14.570 --> 01:04:15.810
<v Speaker 2>this is a sickness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1585
01:04:16.050 --> 01:04:20.280
<v Speaker 2>That that grief is not a pathology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We grieve because we've loved someone,</v>

1586
01:04:20.281 --> 01:04:21.840
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a malfunction.</v>

1587
01:04:21.841 --> 01:04:24.990
<v Speaker 2>It's not sign of madness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a sign that you loved the person</v>

1588
01:04:25.170 --> 01:04:26.940
<v Speaker 2>and the way I'm going to be on what she</v>
<v Speaker 2>says now,</v>

1589
01:04:26.970 --> 01:04:30.660
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think one of the things,</v>

1590
01:04:30.690 --> 01:04:33.240
<v Speaker 2>the fact that the depression and grief</v>
<v Speaker 2>had the same symptoms is really</v>

1591
01:04:33.241 --> 01:04:36.840
<v Speaker 2>significant because I think depression</v>
<v Speaker 2>is grief for your own life,</v>

1592
01:04:36.841 --> 01:04:38.430
<v Speaker 2>not going how it should,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1593
01:04:38.670 --> 01:04:40.740
<v Speaker 2>It's grief for your own needs not being</v>
<v Speaker 2>met.</v>

1594
01:04:41.420 --> 01:04:45.300
<v Speaker 2>Now when someone we love dies or we can</v>
<v Speaker 2>do is hold the survivors and love them,</v>

1595
01:04:45.301 --> 01:04:46.420
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But with,</v>

1596
01:04:46.440 --> 01:04:48.240
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but with,</v>

1597
01:04:48.330 --> 01:04:51.630
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with your own needs not being met,</v>

1598
01:04:51.631 --> 01:04:52.620
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a really interesting sample or there's</v>

1599
01:04:52.621 --> 01:04:53.940
<v Speaker 2>something you've kept brilliantly on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>show,</v>

1600
01:04:53.941 --> 01:04:56.280
<v Speaker 2>joe about psychedelics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm the researcher on Psychedelics,</v>

1601
01:04:56.281 --> 01:04:58.620
<v Speaker 2>which taught me a lot about how we might</v>
<v Speaker 2>think about this differently.</v>

1602
01:04:58.920 --> 01:05:00.060
<v Speaker 2>So as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1603
01:05:00.061 --> 01:05:03.840
<v Speaker 2>you know better than anyone the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>until the mid sixties loads of research</v>

1604
01:05:03.841 --> 01:05:07.470
<v Speaker 2>was done giving Lsd to people with</v>
<v Speaker 2>depression,</v>

1605
01:05:07.530 --> 01:05:08.790
<v Speaker 2>alcoholism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both problems.</v>

1606
01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.280
<v Speaker 2>They weren't done to the standards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We want to do scientific experiments</v>

1607
01:05:11.281 --> 01:05:13.260
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they found really promising results</v>

1608
01:05:13.261 --> 01:05:15.240
<v Speaker 2>and then Nixon shuts the whole thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>

1609
01:05:15.241 --> 01:05:16.740
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In the last six years,</v>

1610
01:05:16.741 --> 01:05:19.660
<v Speaker 2>there's been a huge reawakening this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went and interviewed blas connections,</v>

1611
01:05:19.661 --> 01:05:22.360
<v Speaker 2>the teams that have worked on this in</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1612
01:05:23.140 --> 01:05:25.810
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here in la at Ucla,</v>

1613
01:05:25.810 --> 01:05:27.250
<v Speaker 2>Nyu at Johns Hopkins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Baltimore,</v>

1614
01:05:27.460 --> 01:05:28.720
<v Speaker 2>in London,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at Ucl,</v>

1615
01:05:29.010 --> 01:05:30.910
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Sao Paolo and in Norway.</v>

1616
01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:33.250
<v Speaker 2>And loads of fascinating things and in</v>
<v Speaker 2>fact about this.</v>

1617
01:05:33.251 --> 01:05:35.800
<v Speaker 2>But there's one that I think really</v>
<v Speaker 2>relates to our conversation powerfully.</v>

1618
01:05:36.040 --> 01:05:37.200
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>w well,</v>

1619
01:05:37.210 --> 01:05:38.920
<v Speaker 2>loads of things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we'll talk about one.</v>

1620
01:05:39.240 --> 01:05:42.070
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there was a sub finding a,</v>

1621
01:05:42.071 --> 01:05:43.990
<v Speaker 2>one of the studies that I became</v>
<v Speaker 2>obsessed with,</v>

1622
01:05:44.500 --> 01:05:46.540
<v Speaker 2>they did this research at Johns Hopkins</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Baltimore,</v>

1623
01:05:46.840 --> 01:05:50.590
<v Speaker 2>some of the leading scientists in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world where they gave psilocybin the</v>

1624
01:05:50.650 --> 01:05:54.280
<v Speaker 2>active component in magic mushrooms to</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1625
01:05:55.150 --> 01:05:59.410
<v Speaker 2>chronic longterm smokers who tried</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything to stop smoking and had not</v>

1626
01:05:59.411 --> 01:05:59.920
<v Speaker 2>succeeded.</v>

1627
01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:01.240
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've thought about my mother a lot</v>

1628
01:06:01.241 --> 01:06:04.360
<v Speaker 2>because my mother is a chain smoker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a photograph of me and her when</v>

1629
01:06:04.540 --> 01:06:06.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm six months old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's breastfeeding me smoking and</v>

1630
01:06:06.581 --> 01:06:09.370
<v Speaker 2>resting the ashtray on my stomach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

1631
01:06:09.660 --> 01:06:10.493
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1632
01:06:10.630 --> 01:06:12.160
<v Speaker 2>and so they take people like my mother,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1633
01:06:12.220 --> 01:06:13.450
<v Speaker 2>I'd already,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I showed her that picture,</v>

1634
01:06:13.451 --> 01:06:14.770
<v Speaker 2>she said you were fucking difficult</v>
<v Speaker 2>baby.</v>

1635
01:06:14.771 --> 01:06:18.490
<v Speaker 2>I needed that cigarette.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a how they try to blame you when I</v>

1636
01:06:18.491 --> 01:06:21.010
<v Speaker 2>was a fucking baby.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She,</v>

1637
01:06:21.850 --> 01:06:23.190
<v Speaker 2>she's a good person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>

1638
01:06:23.410 --> 01:06:24.071
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1639
01:06:24.071 --> 01:06:27.280
<v Speaker 2>so they take these people quite a</v>
<v Speaker 2>longtime smokers and they gave them</v>

1640
01:06:27.281 --> 01:06:31.510
<v Speaker 2>three doses of psilocybin over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>think it was six months.</v>

1641
01:06:31.530 --> 01:06:33.710
<v Speaker 2>It was six months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So two month intervals of thing.</v>

1642
01:06:34.270 --> 01:06:38.170
<v Speaker 2>And what they found was extraordinary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>80% of them stop smoking.</v>

1643
01:06:38.260 --> 01:06:39.940
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it still remained not smoking more</v>

1644
01:06:39.941 --> 01:06:40.840
<v Speaker 2>than two years later.</v>

1645
01:06:40.900 --> 01:06:41.830
<v Speaker 2>Incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Think about,</v>

1646
01:06:41.831 --> 01:06:44.830
<v Speaker 2>we were comparing it to 17% but nicotine</v>
<v Speaker 2>patches and they were like,</v>

1647
01:06:44.831 --> 01:06:47.250
<v Speaker 2>what's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they did all this research in this.</v>

1648
01:06:47.260 --> 01:06:50.470
<v Speaker 2>And what we've gotta be careful with</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychedelics is to not talk about it the</v>

1649
01:06:50.471 --> 01:06:53.290
<v Speaker 2>way we were misleadingly told about</v>
<v Speaker 2>antidepressants,</v>

1650
01:06:53.291 --> 01:06:54.850
<v Speaker 2>chemical anti depressants in the 90s,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

1651
01:06:55.050 --> 01:06:56.530
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it flips the chemical switch in your</v>

1652
01:06:56.531 --> 01:06:58.570
<v Speaker 2>brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Clearly a chemical process happens in</v>

1653
01:06:58.571 --> 01:06:59.110
<v Speaker 2>the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1654
01:06:59.110 --> 01:07:01.690
<v Speaker 2>but what they found,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the most important thing and the</v>

1655
01:07:01.691 --> 01:07:05.830
<v Speaker 2>lesson for people who don't want to use</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychedelics as well is a sub finding.</v>

1656
01:07:05.860 --> 01:07:09.040
<v Speaker 2>So if you take,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you take psilocybin,</v>

1657
01:07:09.340 --> 01:07:12.400
<v Speaker 2>most people will have a kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>spiritual experience,</v>

1658
01:07:12.401 --> 01:07:13.750
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1659
01:07:14.740 --> 01:07:17.380
<v Speaker 2>some people will have a super intense</v>
<v Speaker 2>spiritual experience that people have in</v>

1660
01:07:17.390 --> 01:07:20.170
<v Speaker 2>Melbourne and a minority will have no</v>
<v Speaker 2>spiritual experience.</v>

1661
01:07:20.530 --> 01:07:23.740
<v Speaker 2>It turns out the positive effects,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like reduction in depression and</v>

1662
01:07:23.741 --> 01:07:28.741
<v Speaker 2>addiction correlate exactly with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>intensity of the spiritual experience.</v>

1663
01:07:28.910 --> 01:07:31.030
<v Speaker 2>So if you have no spiritual experience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have,</v>

1664
01:07:31.300 --> 01:07:33.340
<v Speaker 2>but here's isn't is dose dependent?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1665
01:07:33.360 --> 01:07:36.280
<v Speaker 2>this cut across those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they gave him three varying doses,</v>

1666
01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:37.960
<v Speaker 2>doses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember,</v>

1667
01:07:37.961 --> 01:07:39.620
<v Speaker 2>but it's in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty significant though.</v>

1668
01:07:39.621 --> 01:07:40.980
<v Speaker 2>That's a very important factor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1669
01:07:40.981 --> 01:07:44.550
<v Speaker 2>So across the three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you were given it three times and you</v>

1670
01:07:44.590 --> 01:07:47.310
<v Speaker 2>always given three different doses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so obviously you would have more.</v>

1671
01:07:47.500 --> 01:07:49.720
<v Speaker 2>Most people have much more intense</v>
<v Speaker 2>experience with the most,</v>

1672
01:07:49.780 --> 01:07:51.440
<v Speaker 2>with the strongest dose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>

1673
01:07:51.441 --> 01:07:55.450
<v Speaker 2>the key thing I think about that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that finding is that</v>

1674
01:07:56.980 --> 01:08:00.310
<v Speaker 2>one of the experts put it to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not that it's a chemical process,</v>

1675
01:08:00.311 --> 01:08:02.770
<v Speaker 2>it's a learning experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What it does is it gives you an</v>

1676
01:08:02.771 --> 01:08:06.490
<v Speaker 2>experience of what it can feel like to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be deeply connected,</v>

1677
01:08:06.700 --> 01:08:08.590
<v Speaker 2>to feel deeply connected to the people</v>
<v Speaker 2>around you,</v>

1678
01:08:08.591 --> 01:08:10.210
<v Speaker 2>to the natural world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Incredible,</v>

1679
01:08:10.211 --> 01:08:11.830
<v Speaker 2>strong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>natural antidepressant that we can talk</v>

1680
01:08:11.831 --> 01:08:14.630
<v Speaker 2>about if you want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you psychedelic experience?</v>

1681
01:08:14.830 --> 01:08:17.860
<v Speaker 2>When was a teenager?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bought some and I think they were a</v>

1682
01:08:17.960 --> 01:08:19.460
<v Speaker 2>drug dealer in Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tam Market.</v>

1683
01:08:19.560 --> 01:08:22.100
<v Speaker 2>I'm holding off because I've got to go</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the Amazon rainforest later this year</v>

1684
01:08:22.101 --> 01:08:24.710
<v Speaker 2>and I want to use Iowasca for the first</v>
<v Speaker 2>time in the Amazon.</v>

1685
01:08:24.740 --> 01:08:27.560
<v Speaker 2>Never had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause you know I'm getting that from the</v>

1686
01:08:27.561 --> 01:08:28.910
<v Speaker 2>way you're describing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting.</v>

1687
01:08:28.911 --> 01:08:30.380
<v Speaker 2>I interviewed huge numbers of people who</v>
<v Speaker 2>had,</v>

1688
01:08:30.410 --> 01:08:31.610
<v Speaker 2>tell me what you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you're getting.</v>

1689
01:08:31.611 --> 01:08:32.200
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting.</v>

1690
01:08:32.200 --> 01:08:36.700
<v Speaker 3>Well this the what it is is a dissolving</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the ego.</v>

1691
01:08:36.730 --> 01:08:41.050
<v Speaker 3>That's a general factor that almost</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody reports.</v>

1692
01:08:41.250 --> 01:08:45.280
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it also releases you from deeply</v>

1693
01:08:45.281 --> 01:08:48.230
<v Speaker 3>ingrained patterns of behavior and</v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking and,</v>

1694
01:08:48.231 --> 01:08:51.310
<v Speaker 3>and highlights them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So as much as it is a spiritual</v>

1695
01:08:51.311 --> 01:08:53.560
<v Speaker 3>experience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's also a dissolving of the self.</v>

1696
01:08:53.561 --> 01:08:54.394
<v Speaker 3>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1697
01:08:54.810 --> 01:08:58.210
<v Speaker 3>the way we define ourselves is</v>
<v Speaker 3>oftentimes very limiting.</v>

1698
01:08:58.540 --> 01:09:01.390
<v Speaker 3>You have this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the way I describe it and this</v>

1699
01:09:01.391 --> 01:09:05.560
<v Speaker 3>is the way I described very powerful</v>
<v Speaker 3>psychedelic experiences.</v>

1700
01:09:06.100 --> 01:09:07.720
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you remember the old windows thing?</v>

1701
01:09:07.721 --> 01:09:08.410
<v Speaker 3>Control,</v>
<v Speaker 3>alt,</v>

1702
01:09:08.410 --> 01:09:10.060
<v Speaker 3>delete.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how you'd reboot.</v>

1703
01:09:10.900 --> 01:09:12.280
<v Speaker 3>It's like control,</v>
<v Speaker 3>alt,</v>

1704
01:09:12.310 --> 01:09:17.170
<v Speaker 3>delete for your brain and your brain</v>
<v Speaker 3>reboots with a fresh new desktop.</v>

1705
01:09:17.230 --> 01:09:21.370
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing on it except one folder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that one to folder is titled My old</v>

1706
01:09:21.371 --> 01:09:23.470
<v Speaker 3>bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you have two choices.</v>

1707
01:09:23.471 --> 01:09:27.430
<v Speaker 3>You can either start fresh and try to re</v>
<v Speaker 3>examine the world with fresh eyes or</v>

1708
01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:32.110
<v Speaker 3>what's more convenient as you slowly</v>
<v Speaker 3>slipped into the my old bullshit folder</v>

1709
01:09:32.350 --> 01:09:35.920
<v Speaker 3>and start opening it up and repeating</v>
<v Speaker 3>patterns in lighting that cigarette up</v>

1710
01:09:35.921 --> 01:09:38.620
<v Speaker 3>when you really shouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Having that drink when you probably</v>

1711
01:09:38.621 --> 01:09:42.820
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't do that either.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And those things are common because it's</v>

1712
01:09:42.821 --> 01:09:44.920
<v Speaker 3>comforting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's comforting for people to repeat</v>

1713
01:09:44.921 --> 01:09:46.240
<v Speaker 3>patterns that they're familiar with.</v>

1714
01:09:46.450 --> 01:09:48.640
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a few things in that you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>totally right and the scientific</v>

1715
01:09:48.641 --> 01:09:49.830
<v Speaker 2>evidence is overwhelming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

1716
01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:51.460
<v Speaker 2>at Ucl,</v>
<v Speaker 2>University College,</v>

1717
01:09:51.461 --> 01:09:53.470
<v Speaker 2>London,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Professor David Nutt did all this</v>

1718
01:09:53.471 --> 01:09:56.440
<v Speaker 2>research that shows it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that happens in your</v>

1719
01:09:56.441 --> 01:09:59.620
<v Speaker 2>brain when you take psychedelics is the</v>
<v Speaker 2>part of the brain that relates to ego</v>

1720
01:09:59.621 --> 01:10:02.260
<v Speaker 2>just doesn't function right and then be</v>
<v Speaker 2>interviewing.</v>

1721
01:10:02.530 --> 01:10:05.800
<v Speaker 2>One of the most moving into I did was a</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy called mark who was in one of the</v>

1722
01:10:05.830 --> 01:10:08.360
<v Speaker 2>studies in Baltimore who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1723
01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:13.560
<v Speaker 2>was a very shy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>reserved shutdown guy when he was 10 his</v>

1724
01:10:13.781 --> 01:10:17.560
<v Speaker 2>dad had died and no one had talked to</v>
<v Speaker 2>him about his dad's death.</v>

1725
01:10:17.561 --> 01:10:21.130
<v Speaker 2>His mother was just totally devastated</v>
<v Speaker 2>and no one had talked to him about it</v>

1726
01:10:21.820 --> 01:10:24.850
<v Speaker 2>and he'd always been very shut down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he takes the psilocybin and he had</v>

1727
01:10:24.851 --> 01:10:28.600
<v Speaker 2>this really intense experience where he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he thinks he's in space and he believed</v>

1728
01:10:28.601 --> 01:10:33.601
<v Speaker 2>he met his father and his father</v>
<v Speaker 2>apologized for leaving him.</v>

1729
01:10:33.790 --> 01:10:38.530
<v Speaker 2>And then he reached into mark and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>pulled out these walls and he said,</v>

1730
01:10:38.890 --> 01:10:41.230
<v Speaker 2>I want to thank these walls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've protected my son.</v>

1731
01:10:41.290 --> 01:10:43.450
<v Speaker 2>They've done a good job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can let them go now.</v>

1732
01:10:44.170 --> 01:10:46.710
<v Speaker 2>And after that mark really changed how</v>
<v Speaker 2>he lived there.</v>

1733
01:10:46.711 --> 01:10:49.180
<v Speaker 2>She went,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she said he was able to sustain that</v>

1734
01:10:49.181 --> 01:10:50.890
<v Speaker 2>insight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He went and learned a lot of meditation.</v>

1735
01:10:51.310 --> 01:10:52.450
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

1736
01:10:52.451 --> 01:10:52.991
<v Speaker 2>I think you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

1737
01:10:52.991 --> 01:10:55.870
<v Speaker 2>you're absolutely right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's about dissolving the ego and what</v>

1738
01:10:55.871 --> 01:11:00.871
<v Speaker 2>an experience of Eagles egolessness can</v>
<v Speaker 2>do is almost point a direction on a</v>

1739
01:11:02.981 --> 01:11:03.940
<v Speaker 2>compass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1740
01:11:04.210 --> 01:11:07.060
<v Speaker 2>But there's another aspect that emerged</v>
<v Speaker 2>in that,</v>

1741
01:11:07.061 --> 01:11:09.010
<v Speaker 2>which I think is one of the slight</v>
<v Speaker 2>differences between us.</v>

1742
01:11:09.190 --> 01:11:09.710
<v Speaker 2>I like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1743
01:11:09.710 --> 01:11:11.200
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a lot in what you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>saying.</v>

1744
01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:12.910
<v Speaker 2>So in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in London,</v>

1745
01:11:12.911 --> 01:11:14.100
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this research with chronically</v>

1746
01:11:14.100 --> 01:11:16.710
<v Speaker 1>depressed people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Robin Carhart Harris,</v>

1747
01:11:16.711 --> 01:11:18.120
<v Speaker 1>he led that study.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said to me,</v>

1748
01:11:18.121 --> 01:11:21.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's one woman chronically depressed,</v>

1749
01:11:21.091 --> 01:11:23.190
<v Speaker 1>she takes the Psilocybin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she gets everything you're saying,</v>

1750
01:11:23.191 --> 01:11:25.890
<v Speaker 1>the dissolution of ego,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the need for all the things you're</v>

1751
01:11:25.891 --> 01:11:29.100
<v Speaker 1>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then she goes back to her job in a</v>

1752
01:11:29.101 --> 01:11:33.150
<v Speaker 1>shitty seaside town where you just can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>live compatible with those insights.</v>

1753
01:11:33.160 --> 01:11:34.650
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She just couldn't.</v>

1754
01:11:34.830 --> 01:11:36.930
<v Speaker 1>And so her depression came back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So to me,</v>

1755
01:11:36.931 --> 01:11:39.000
<v Speaker 1>what the size of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where individuals can change the lives.</v>

1756
01:11:39.060 --> 01:11:40.110
<v Speaker 1>Obviously they should.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1757
01:11:40.111 --> 01:11:43.050
<v Speaker 1>And we would totally agree on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of people do have more margin</v>

1758
01:11:43.051 --> 01:11:46.200
<v Speaker 1>to change their lives and they think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're in total agreement on that.</v>

1759
01:11:46.770 --> 01:11:50.070
<v Speaker 1>And I think you would probably agree</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there are some people who are,</v>

1760
01:11:50.700 --> 01:11:52.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>through no fault of their own,</v>

1761
01:11:52.890 --> 01:11:55.800
<v Speaker 1>like a lot of my relatives fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>stock,</v>

1762
01:11:55.830 --> 01:11:56.280
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1763
01:11:56.280 --> 01:11:59.640
<v Speaker 1>And then the very people will have no</v>
<v Speaker 1>margin of change.</v>

1764
01:11:59.670 --> 01:12:01.770
<v Speaker 1>But a lot of people have such a small</v>
<v Speaker 1>margin to change,</v>

1765
01:12:02.010 --> 01:12:05.340
<v Speaker 1>but that margin will not carry them out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of depression or anxiety or addiction.</v>

1766
01:12:05.341 --> 01:12:09.240
<v Speaker 1>And that's why we need the widest is</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the World Health Organization says.</v>

1767
01:12:09.241 --> 01:12:11.970
<v Speaker 1>You need social solutions as well as</v>
<v Speaker 1>individual solutions.</v>

1768
01:12:12.150 --> 01:12:16.980
<v Speaker 1>When to change the way the society works</v>
<v Speaker 1>in all sorts of ways that reduce the</v>

1769
01:12:16.981 --> 01:12:19.080
<v Speaker 1>things that are causing this pain in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>first place.</v>

1770
01:12:19.081 --> 01:12:21.570
<v Speaker 1>Do you see what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Changing the way society works though is</v>

1771
01:12:21.571 --> 01:12:25.680
<v Speaker 1>a grand in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in tangled,</v>

1772
01:12:25.740 --> 01:12:30.440
<v Speaker 1>gigantic undertaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas changing your own life is not so</v>

1773
01:12:30.441 --> 01:12:32.700
<v Speaker 1>actually doing your own life is</v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult.</v>

1774
01:12:33.270 --> 01:12:35.160
<v Speaker 1>It can be very difficult for a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

1775
01:12:35.161 --> 01:12:38.250
<v Speaker 1>but it's far easier than changing</v>
<v Speaker 1>society.</v>

1776
01:12:38.370 --> 01:12:41.400
<v Speaker 1>I understand what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who you're telling me has the</v>

1777
01:12:41.401 --> 01:12:45.120
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic experience experiences this</v>
<v Speaker 1>dissolving of ego,</v>

1778
01:12:45.121 --> 01:12:49.290
<v Speaker 1>this beautiful spiritual awakening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then goes back to a job that's like</v>

1779
01:12:49.291 --> 01:12:51.330
<v Speaker 1>opening up the folder of mild bullshit.</v>

1780
01:12:51.330 --> 01:12:53.820
<v Speaker 1>It's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's going back to the same patterns.</v>

1781
01:12:53.850 --> 01:12:56.600
<v Speaker 1>Well I would say she's being forced into</v>
<v Speaker 1>that folder cause she's what she gonna</v>

1782
01:12:56.620 --> 01:12:57.850
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but lean,</v>

1783
01:12:57.930 --> 01:13:00.210
<v Speaker 1>what she's going to do is what a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people do.</v>

1784
01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:02.040
<v Speaker 1>I mean a lot of people change their</v>
<v Speaker 1>lives.</v>

1785
01:13:02.070 --> 01:13:04.980
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's not impossible to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if this woman had kids.</v>

1786
01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:07.240
<v Speaker 1>I didn't ask it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1787
01:13:07.260 --> 01:13:09.430
<v Speaker 1>imagine being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even can't imagine people being stuck</v>

1788
01:13:09.630 --> 01:13:11.460
<v Speaker 1>big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We makes it very difficult.</v>

1789
01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:13.800
<v Speaker 1>It makes it very difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But she's not in jail.</v>

1790
01:13:13.890 --> 01:13:15.480
<v Speaker 1>She's not a president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At some point you're making.</v>

1791
01:13:15.481 --> 01:13:18.720
<v Speaker 1>But I think actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this might sound strange in some</v>

1792
01:13:18.721 --> 01:13:21.420
<v Speaker 1>ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think changing the society is easier</v>

1793
01:13:21.421 --> 01:13:23.230
<v Speaker 1>than isolated individuals changing</v>
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>

1794
01:13:23.330 --> 01:13:24.870
<v Speaker 1>so I'll give you an exam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How is that possible?</v>

1795
01:13:24.900 --> 01:13:25.481
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you some,</v>

1796
01:13:25.481 --> 01:13:26.314
<v Speaker 1>but I'm gay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1797
01:13:26.670 --> 01:13:29.370
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I think about the incredible</v>

1798
01:13:29.371 --> 01:13:30.600
<v Speaker 1>transformation I've seen in my life.</v>

1799
01:13:30.620 --> 01:13:33.810
<v Speaker 1>So I tell the story in Los Connections</v>
<v Speaker 1>about my friend Andrew Sullivan,</v>

1800
01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:35.040
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>1994,</v>

1801
01:13:35.580 --> 01:13:38.580
<v Speaker 1>Andrew was diagnosed with HIV.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His first thought was,</v>

1802
01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:40.010
<v Speaker 1>I deserve this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1803
01:13:40.011 --> 01:13:42.180
<v Speaker 1>He'd been raised in such a homophobic</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

1804
01:13:42.390 --> 01:13:43.141
<v Speaker 1>He thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

1805
01:13:43.141 --> 01:13:45.780
<v Speaker 1>I deserve to have this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this illness.</v>

1806
01:13:45.781 --> 01:13:48.060
<v Speaker 1>It's going to kill me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was watching his friends die all</v>

1807
01:13:48.061 --> 01:13:50.040
<v Speaker 1>around him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He thought it was about to die.</v>

1808
01:13:50.041 --> 01:13:53.310
<v Speaker 1>This is before protease inhibitors and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it goes to province town,</v>

1809
01:13:53.610 --> 01:13:57.420
<v Speaker 1>little town in Cape Cod to do what he</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought would be the last thing he would</v>

1810
01:13:57.480 --> 01:13:58.560
<v Speaker 1>ever do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1811
01:13:58.980 --> 01:14:01.890
<v Speaker 1>And he wrote a book about crazy Utopian</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea that he thought,</v>

1812
01:14:02.010 --> 01:14:04.590
<v Speaker 1>this is never going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm never going to live to see this.</v>

1813
01:14:04.591 --> 01:14:06.180
<v Speaker 1>But maybe generations from now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what happened.</v>

1814
01:14:06.360 --> 01:14:08.580
<v Speaker 1>It was the first book ever arguing for</v>
<v Speaker 1>gay marriage.</v>

1815
01:14:08.670 --> 01:14:10.500
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if I get depressed about this,</v>

1816
01:14:10.510 --> 01:14:12.280
<v Speaker 1>try to imagine going in time and saying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to Andrew,</v>

1817
01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:12.770
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>noted.</v>

1818
01:14:12.770 --> 01:14:13.320
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1819
01:14:13.320 --> 01:14:15.820
<v Speaker 2>I've got some good news.</v>
<v Speaker 2>25 years from now,</v>

1820
01:14:16.210 --> 01:14:18.580
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be alive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's not the good news.</v>

1821
01:14:18.880 --> 01:14:22.300
<v Speaker 2>The Supreme Court of the United States</v>
<v Speaker 2>is going to quote this book in their</v>

1822
01:14:22.301 --> 01:14:25.360
<v Speaker 2>ruling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>making it mandatory for all states in</v>

1823
01:14:25.361 --> 01:14:26.890
<v Speaker 2>the United States to introduce gay</v>
<v Speaker 2>marriage.</v>

1824
01:14:26.891 --> 01:14:28.780
<v Speaker 2>And the next day you'll be invited to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the White House,</v>

1825
01:14:28.930 --> 01:14:32.410
<v Speaker 2>which will be lit up in the colors of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the rainbow flag to celebrate with the</v>

1826
01:14:32.411 --> 01:14:33.250
<v Speaker 2>president.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And by the way,</v>

1827
01:14:33.251 --> 01:14:35.740
<v Speaker 2>that president is going to be black,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1828
01:14:36.040 --> 01:14:38.020
<v Speaker 2>That would have sounded like ridiculous</v>
<v Speaker 2>science fiction.</v>

1829
01:14:38.140 --> 01:14:40.240
<v Speaker 2>Now imagine saying to gay people 50</v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago,</v>

1830
01:14:40.480 --> 01:14:43.330
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to change the society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's way too hard.</v>

1831
01:14:43.540 --> 01:14:45.670
<v Speaker 2>When you can do is focus on changing</v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself.</v>

1832
01:14:46.070 --> 01:14:48.190
<v Speaker 2>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gay people would be really fucking</v>

1833
01:14:48.191 --> 01:14:50.020
<v Speaker 2>miserable if that's what they'd done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1834
01:14:50.260 --> 01:14:53.890
<v Speaker 2>If that's how it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my life will be immeasurably worse if</v>

1835
01:14:53.891 --> 01:14:55.120
<v Speaker 2>gay people are just said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

1836
01:14:55.170 --> 01:14:57.610
<v Speaker 2>It's so hard to change society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's change ourselves.</v>

1837
01:14:57.611 --> 01:15:02.611
<v Speaker 2>We would've remained trapped in Shitty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>awful institutions and systems that kept</v>

1838
01:15:02.921 --> 01:15:04.720
<v Speaker 2>us down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually think,</v>

1839
01:15:04.750 --> 01:15:06.640
<v Speaker 2>if I think about most of the people I</v>
<v Speaker 2>know who are depressed,</v>

1840
01:15:07.060 --> 01:15:08.940
<v Speaker 2>to be honest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their margin for individual changes</v>

1841
01:15:08.950 --> 01:15:10.720
<v Speaker 2>limited,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but banding together,</v>

1842
01:15:10.721 --> 01:15:13.090
<v Speaker 2>their margin for change is huge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1843
01:15:13.250 --> 01:15:15.790
<v Speaker 2>It's thinking about which was about the</v>
<v Speaker 2>universal basic income for example.</v>

1844
01:15:15.791 --> 01:15:16.930
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Massively.</v>

1845
01:15:16.931 --> 01:15:18.610
<v Speaker 2>We're getting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to another subject here,</v>

1846
01:15:18.740 --> 01:15:21.540
<v Speaker 2>so she'd gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then it's you.</v>

1847
01:15:21.790 --> 01:15:24.140
<v Speaker 2>You keep going on one to the next,</v>

1848
01:15:25.350 --> 01:15:28.920
<v Speaker 3>shut up with one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's far easier to explain to one</v>

1849
01:15:28.921 --> 01:15:32.280
<v Speaker 3>person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one life why it's wrong to be homophobic</v>

1850
01:15:32.281 --> 01:15:36.480
<v Speaker 3>than it is to change all the rednecks</v>
<v Speaker 3>and all the ignorant people who don't</v>

1851
01:15:36.481 --> 01:15:40.590
<v Speaker 3>read and all the people that have deeply</v>
<v Speaker 3>ingrained archaic religious ideas about</v>

1852
01:15:40.591 --> 01:15:45.330
<v Speaker 3>homosexuality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's far easier to educate and luminate</v>

1853
01:15:45.331 --> 01:15:49.290
<v Speaker 3>one person and it also can be done with</v>
<v Speaker 3>the aid of psychedelics,</v>

1854
01:15:49.470 --> 01:15:52.470
<v Speaker 3>especially MTMA therapy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This one of the things that maps is</v>

1855
01:15:52.471 --> 01:15:55.260
<v Speaker 3>doing right now with Mtma therapy and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

1856
01:15:55.770 --> 01:15:58.350
<v Speaker 3>they're involved in a bunch of clinical</v>
<v Speaker 3>trials right now,</v>

1857
01:15:58.950 --> 01:16:02.910
<v Speaker 3>helping people to all sorts of traumatic</v>
<v Speaker 3>stress experiences,</v>

1858
01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:04.980
<v Speaker 3>soldiers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people that experienced physical</v>

1859
01:16:04.981 --> 01:16:06.540
<v Speaker 3>violence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all these people that are,</v>

1860
01:16:06.580 --> 01:16:09.780
<v Speaker 3>it's helping them alleviate a lot of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>problems that are life.</v>

1861
01:16:10.220 --> 01:16:15.220
<v Speaker 3>There's patterns that people are that</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have in their mind that they can</v>

1862
01:16:15.271 --> 01:16:16.530
<v Speaker 3>release.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure,</v>

1863
01:16:16.590 --> 01:16:19.670
<v Speaker 3>you could release and you can be</v>
<v Speaker 3>educated and you can understand.</v>

1864
01:16:19.690 --> 01:16:22.020
<v Speaker 3>You can change and grow as an</v>
<v Speaker 3>individual.</v>

1865
01:16:22.021 --> 01:16:24.960
<v Speaker 3>It's far easier to do that with one</v>
<v Speaker 3>person,</v>

1866
01:16:25.110 --> 01:16:28.290
<v Speaker 3>for one person to change their life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then it changed an entire culture.</v>

1867
01:16:28.291 --> 01:16:32.010
<v Speaker 3>I do agree that there have been great</v>
<v Speaker 3>strides in this country when it comes to</v>

1868
01:16:32.011 --> 01:16:33.750
<v Speaker 3>discrimination,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when it comes to racism,</v>

1869
01:16:33.751 --> 01:16:35.820
<v Speaker 3>when it comes to so many different</v>
<v Speaker 3>ideas.</v>

1870
01:16:35.950 --> 01:16:39.720
<v Speaker 3>But I think that's connected to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>exchange of ideas that we're</v>

1871
01:16:39.721 --> 01:16:41.460
<v Speaker 3>experiencing now because of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Internet.</v>

1872
01:16:41.700 --> 01:16:44.760
<v Speaker 3>I think because of the fact that there's</v>
<v Speaker 3>so many different arguments back and</v>

1873
01:16:44.761 --> 01:16:48.780
<v Speaker 3>forth and there's so many different ways</v>
<v Speaker 3>to approach things that people are being</v>

1874
01:16:48.781 --> 01:16:53.190
<v Speaker 3>forced to change their opinions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even more religious people today or more</v>

1875
01:16:53.191 --> 01:16:55.680
<v Speaker 3>open to homosexuality than they have</v>
<v Speaker 3>been in the past.</v>

1876
01:16:55.950 --> 01:17:00.950
<v Speaker 3>I've really believed that is a factor of</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the information that's available and</v>

1877
01:17:01.381 --> 01:17:01.831
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1878
01:17:01.831 --> 01:17:05.880
<v Speaker 3>the amount of communication I amount of</v>
<v Speaker 3>gay people that people know from</v>

1879
01:17:05.881 --> 01:17:08.070
<v Speaker 3>television,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from news programs,</v>

1880
01:17:08.071 --> 01:17:11.480
<v Speaker 3>from all these different shows where</v>
<v Speaker 3>they get a different sense of,</v>

1881
01:17:11.481 --> 01:17:12.710
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you see Ellen everyday?</v>

1882
01:17:12.770 --> 01:17:14.310
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gay people can't be Evil Ellen.</v>

1883
01:17:14.311 --> 01:17:15.830
<v Speaker 3>So Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

1884
01:17:15.831 --> 01:17:16.730
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of that.</v>

1885
01:17:16.810 --> 01:17:18.850
<v Speaker 2>I think you're totally right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think that shows that the first</v>

1886
01:17:18.851 --> 01:17:20.950
<v Speaker 2>thing you said is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is too simplistic.</v>

1887
01:17:20.951 --> 01:17:24.370
<v Speaker 2>So the thing is that the division</v>
<v Speaker 2>between the,</v>

1888
01:17:24.371 --> 01:17:27.010
<v Speaker 2>I think the last thing you point you</v>
<v Speaker 2>made is totally on the money,</v>

1889
01:17:27.280 --> 01:17:30.160
<v Speaker 2>but why didn't you were saying that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>division is the idea that is easier to</v>

1890
01:17:30.161 --> 01:17:31.720
<v Speaker 2>persuade individuals and persuade the</v>
<v Speaker 2>society.</v>

1891
01:17:31.930 --> 01:17:34.600
<v Speaker 2>You persuade the society by persuading</v>
<v Speaker 2>individuals who just persuade lots of</v>

1892
01:17:34.601 --> 01:17:37.180
<v Speaker 2>individuals and they banned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

1893
01:17:38.110 --> 01:17:38.551
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

1894
01:17:38.551 --> 01:17:42.420
<v Speaker 3>I think we're splitting hairs here</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I think if obviously if you</v>

1895
01:17:42.421 --> 01:17:44.580
<v Speaker 3>change every individual,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you change society,</v>

1896
01:17:44.880 --> 01:17:48.720
<v Speaker 3>but it's far easier to change one person</v>
<v Speaker 3>than it is to change 350 million.</v>

1897
01:17:48.980 --> 01:17:51.770
<v Speaker 2>But that's obviously true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you changed 350 million by changing</v>

1898
01:17:51.830 --> 01:17:53.660
<v Speaker 2>one person and one passport by banding</v>
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>

1899
01:17:53.890 --> 01:17:57.200
<v Speaker 2>But you also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the ways that you changed those</v>

1900
01:17:57.201 --> 01:18:00.200
<v Speaker 2>one p that one person is by banding</v>
<v Speaker 2>together in a group,</v>

1901
01:18:00.201 --> 01:18:01.580
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So gay people for example,</v>

1902
01:18:01.581 --> 01:18:02.900
<v Speaker 2>would be a good example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there are many,</v>

1903
01:18:03.200 --> 01:18:04.940
<v Speaker 2>many good examples.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what you're saying about individual</v>

1904
01:18:04.941 --> 01:18:06.140
<v Speaker 2>psychology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's important to say you're,</v>

1905
01:18:06.230 --> 01:18:08.000
<v Speaker 2>you're right about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there are,</v>

1906
01:18:08.120 --> 01:18:10.070
<v Speaker 2>there's a very broad scientific</v>
<v Speaker 2>agreement.</v>

1907
01:18:10.071 --> 01:18:12.800
<v Speaker 2>There are three kinds of cause of</v>
<v Speaker 2>depression and anxiety.</v>

1908
01:18:12.801 --> 01:18:14.810
<v Speaker 2>And most mental health if at all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mental health problems,</v>

1909
01:18:15.840 --> 01:18:17.360
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ratio varies.</v>

1910
01:18:17.480 --> 01:18:19.730
<v Speaker 2>So there's biological causes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which we talked about.</v>

1911
01:18:19.760 --> 01:18:20.870
<v Speaker 2>Your genes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

1912
01:18:20.871 --> 01:18:22.670
<v Speaker 2>can make chemo sensitive to these</v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

1913
01:18:23.090 --> 01:18:25.370
<v Speaker 2>There's psychological causes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which are the things you're talking</v>

1914
01:18:25.371 --> 01:18:27.140
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which are very real and important.</v>

1915
01:18:27.410 --> 01:18:29.510
<v Speaker 2>And there's social causes so that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1916
01:18:29.690 --> 01:18:31.250
<v Speaker 2>a lot of the other things we've talked</v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

1917
01:18:31.910 --> 01:18:34.310
<v Speaker 2>and I think at a way you don't need to</v>
<v Speaker 2>play them off against each other.</v>

1918
01:18:34.311 --> 01:18:35.300
<v Speaker 2>They're all real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1919
01:18:35.320 --> 01:18:37.350
<v Speaker 2>And you want to deal with all of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1920
01:18:37.360 --> 01:18:38.290
<v Speaker 2>so it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's a,</v>

1921
01:18:38.310 --> 01:18:40.940
<v Speaker 2>I want to get to argue with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're saying we should deal</v>

1922
01:18:40.941 --> 01:18:42.800
<v Speaker 2>with the psychological factor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm saying we should deal with the</v>

1923
01:18:42.801 --> 01:18:44.300
<v Speaker 2>social factor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're totally right.</v>

1924
01:18:44.301 --> 01:18:45.700
<v Speaker 2>We should deal with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we should deal with Bob.</v>

1925
01:18:45.870 --> 01:18:46.611
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

1926
01:18:46.611 --> 01:18:48.740
<v Speaker 2>I think where we certainly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>

1927
01:18:48.741 --> 01:18:49.200
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

1928
01:18:49.200 --> 01:18:50.033
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1929
01:18:50.100 --> 01:18:52.620
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think that the idea that,</v>

1930
01:18:53.280 --> 01:18:56.580
<v Speaker 3>so like think of what you're saying in</v>
<v Speaker 3>terms of people,</v>

1931
01:18:56.930 --> 01:18:59.130
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>living unfulfilled lives,</v>

1932
01:18:59.131 --> 01:19:03.000
<v Speaker 3>living in job or working in jobs that</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't enjoy,</v>

1933
01:19:03.001 --> 01:19:05.730
<v Speaker 3>where they're being controlled by a</v>
<v Speaker 3>boss,</v>

1934
01:19:06.480 --> 01:19:10.770
<v Speaker 3>it's far easier for one person to choose</v>
<v Speaker 3>to change the path of their life than to</v>

1935
01:19:10.771 --> 01:19:13.650
<v Speaker 3>try to restructure society where that</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't exist anymore.</v>

1936
01:19:13.740 --> 01:19:17.490
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ceos like this is what this is,</v>

1937
01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:20.610
<v Speaker 3>is intent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a Ma,</v>

1938
01:19:20.640 --> 01:19:25.500
<v Speaker 3>I mean obviously that was a huge factor</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the 2016 election.</v>

1939
01:19:25.501 --> 01:19:28.680
<v Speaker 3>It was one of the things that was talked</v>
<v Speaker 3>about is a wealth inequality.</v>

1940
01:19:29.400 --> 01:19:31.800
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no greater version of wealth</v>

1941
01:19:31.801 --> 01:19:35.160
<v Speaker 3>inequality than the difference between</v>
<v Speaker 3>the CEO of a massive company and its</v>

1942
01:19:35.161 --> 01:19:36.600
<v Speaker 3>lowest worker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1943
01:19:36.601 --> 01:19:39.510
<v Speaker 3>it literally is like a king and a</v>
<v Speaker 3>peasant.</v>

1944
01:19:39.820 --> 01:19:43.530
<v Speaker 3>It's a very strange sort of a structure</v>
<v Speaker 3>that very recently has it become.</v>

1945
01:19:43.530 --> 01:19:44.430
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>

1946
01:19:44.520 --> 01:19:47.250
<v Speaker 3>But it's so common.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1947
01:19:47.251 --> 01:19:48.750
<v Speaker 3>it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's ingrained.</v>

1948
01:19:48.751 --> 01:19:50.280
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how many corporations are there that</v>

1949
01:19:50.281 --> 01:19:52.310
<v Speaker 3>operate like that top down?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>

1950
01:19:52.311 --> 01:19:55.620
<v Speaker 3>it's gigantic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And to change that I think would be far</v>

1951
01:19:55.621 --> 01:19:59.670
<v Speaker 3>more difficult than to change an</v>
<v Speaker 3>individual's path and to tell this one</v>

1952
01:19:59.671 --> 01:20:00.510
<v Speaker 3>person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>

1953
01:20:00.511 --> 01:20:03.480
<v Speaker 3>what do you really want to do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you really like making pottery?</v>

1954
01:20:03.680 --> 01:20:03.941
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1955
01:20:03.941 --> 01:20:06.990
<v Speaker 3>you should try to make pottery for a</v>
<v Speaker 3>living because this working for</v>

1956
01:20:07.380 --> 01:20:10.320
<v Speaker 3>chemicals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to ever feel fulfilled.</v>

1957
01:20:10.321 --> 01:20:13.050
<v Speaker 3>You're always gonna have that same</v>
<v Speaker 3>anxiety on Sunday night before you go to</v>

1958
01:20:13.051 --> 01:20:14.490
<v Speaker 3>bed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're always going to feel like shit</v>

1959
01:20:14.880 --> 01:20:17.010
<v Speaker 3>while you're at work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're always going to be numb.</v>

1960
01:20:17.011 --> 01:20:20.070
<v Speaker 3>You're going to be probably listening to</v>
<v Speaker 3>the podcasts like this while you're</v>

1961
01:20:20.071 --> 01:20:22.920
<v Speaker 3>working just to try to pass the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you're right</v>

1962
01:20:23.180 --> 01:20:24.580
<v Speaker 2>and totally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

1963
01:20:24.610 --> 01:20:27.060
<v Speaker 2>if you can do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you've got that margin per change,</v>

1964
01:20:27.180 --> 01:20:29.430
<v Speaker 2>100% my advice to you is that why</v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't you</v>

1965
01:20:29.550 --> 01:20:32.100
<v Speaker 3>be able to do it eventually?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You might not be able to do it right</v>

1966
01:20:32.101 --> 01:20:34.050
<v Speaker 3>now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you plan for it,</v>

1967
01:20:34.140 --> 01:20:35.520
<v Speaker 3>why wouldn't you be able to do it?</v>

1968
01:20:36.730 --> 01:20:38.460
<v Speaker 2>I think about one of my closest</v>
<v Speaker 2>relatives,</v>

1969
01:20:38.461 --> 01:20:39.570
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's,</v>

1970
01:20:39.630 --> 01:20:43.020
<v Speaker 2>she's</v>
<v Speaker 2>very depressed.</v>

1971
01:20:43.021 --> 01:20:45.720
<v Speaker 2>She's got two young kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's working really hard.</v>

1972
01:20:45.960 --> 01:20:48.810
<v Speaker 2>She's in a Shitty town.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1973
01:20:49.050 --> 01:20:53.130
<v Speaker 2>she has very controlled work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to think.</v>

1974
01:20:53.430 --> 01:20:56.520
<v Speaker 2>I've desperately tried to think of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>margins of change that I can help her</v>

1975
01:20:56.521 --> 01:20:57.990
<v Speaker 2>facilitate in her life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1976
01:20:58.920 --> 01:21:02.850
<v Speaker 2>And I've really struggled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's an environment where most</v>

1977
01:21:02.851 --> 01:21:05.080
<v Speaker 2>people are depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most people are obese.</v>

1978
01:21:05.100 --> 01:21:06.360
<v Speaker 2>This is England.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1979
01:21:06.390 --> 01:21:07.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I mean it could've just as easily</v>

1980
01:21:08.100 --> 01:21:11.520
<v Speaker 2>manageable spent a lot of time in the u</v>
<v Speaker 2>s but I think it's more people with this</v>

1981
01:21:11.521 --> 01:21:14.190
<v Speaker 2>problem in the u s um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1982
01:21:14.490 --> 01:21:16.680
<v Speaker 2>now I think we've essentially cut off</v>
<v Speaker 2>case.</v>

1983
01:21:16.740 --> 01:21:20.820
<v Speaker 2>That's a very nice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyone who has any margin of change I go</v>

1984
01:21:20.821 --> 01:21:23.310
<v Speaker 2>through in Los Connections,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the seven ways you can change your life,</v>

1985
01:21:23.600 --> 01:21:27.180
<v Speaker 2>that the science at shows will reduce</v>
<v Speaker 2>her depression and anxiety.</v>

1986
01:21:27.240 --> 01:21:28.410
<v Speaker 2>Very likely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1987
01:21:29.160 --> 01:21:31.390
<v Speaker 2>If you've got that margin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do I think the only disagreement trends</v>

1988
01:21:31.391 --> 01:21:32.520
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you're more,</v>

1989
01:21:32.940 --> 01:21:34.050
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1990
01:21:34.920 --> 01:21:38.190
<v Speaker 2>you think more can be done by individual</v>
<v Speaker 2>will alone than I do probably.</v>

1991
01:21:38.460 --> 01:21:40.890
<v Speaker 2>And I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's not disempowering in the</v>

1992
01:21:40.891 --> 01:21:45.891
<v Speaker 2>sense that I would say the most powerful</v>
<v Speaker 2>individually empowering thing you can do</v>

1993
01:21:46.620 --> 01:21:49.830
<v Speaker 2>is band together with other people like</v>
<v Speaker 2>you and fight for something better.</v>

1994
01:21:49.831 --> 01:21:51.930
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Work together towards improving yourself</v>

1995
01:21:53.150 --> 01:21:55.920
<v Speaker 2>with the people in your community and</v>
<v Speaker 2>making some sort of a bond.</v>

1996
01:21:56.190 --> 01:21:57.780
<v Speaker 2>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the most moving things I</v>

1997
01:21:57.781 --> 01:22:00.390
<v Speaker 2>learned about from the book was this</v>
<v Speaker 2>incredible protest movement in Berlin.</v>

1998
01:22:00.430 --> 01:22:02.670
<v Speaker 2>I can tell you about if you want that</v>
<v Speaker 2>transformed.</v>

1999
01:22:02.830 --> 01:22:06.030
<v Speaker 2>It really is one of the places where so</v>
<v Speaker 2>much of,</v>

2000
01:22:06.060 --> 01:22:08.910
<v Speaker 2>of what I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I learned from the scientists</v>

2001
01:22:08.911 --> 01:22:10.980
<v Speaker 2>really fell into place with me and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>

2002
01:22:10.981 --> 01:22:12.240
<v Speaker 2>were very isolated.</v>

2003
01:22:12.240 --> 01:22:15.420
<v Speaker 2>People came together and just said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

2004
01:22:16.110 --> 01:22:18.960
<v Speaker 2>We're not going to take this anymore and</v>
<v Speaker 2>fought for something better.</v>

2005
01:22:18.961 --> 01:22:21.090
<v Speaker 2>I can explain that it's a longer story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you want me to tell about the</v>

2006
01:22:21.091 --> 01:22:21.920
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>

2007
01:22:21.920 --> 01:22:23.820
<v Speaker 2>so I think you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you were saying,</v>

2008
01:22:23.821 --> 01:22:25.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you like to do when you said</v>

2009
01:22:25.420 --> 01:22:26.970
<v Speaker 2>pottery is an example of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is a good example.</v>

2010
01:22:26.971 --> 01:22:29.580
<v Speaker 2>But I will say it may be that what you</v>
<v Speaker 2>like to do and actually cause we're a</v>

2011
01:22:29.581 --> 01:22:31.440
<v Speaker 2>social species,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what most would like to do is</v>

2012
01:22:31.890 --> 01:22:35.370
<v Speaker 2>get together with the people around you</v>
<v Speaker 2>and fight for something better.</v>

2013
01:22:35.371 --> 01:22:39.180
<v Speaker 2>And I think you're totally right about</v>
<v Speaker 2>how this played out in the dynamics</v>

2014
01:22:39.181 --> 01:22:40.500
<v Speaker 2>around the election.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember.</v>

2015
01:22:40.650 --> 01:22:42.810
<v Speaker 2>So it really haunted me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was um,</v>

2016
01:22:43.530 --> 01:22:47.430
<v Speaker 2>with some people who were doing some get</v>
<v Speaker 2>out the vote work in Cleveland and</v>

2017
01:22:48.450 --> 01:22:48.900
<v Speaker 2>Cleveland.</v>

2018
01:22:48.900 --> 01:22:51.090
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's like Detroit without the</v>
<v Speaker 2>poetry of the rooms,</v>

2019
01:22:51.091 --> 01:22:52.110
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's shocking.</v>

2020
01:22:52.500 --> 01:22:55.050
<v Speaker 2>And we were on this street in an area</v>
<v Speaker 2>called Slavic city.</v>

2021
01:22:55.800 --> 01:22:58.570
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that a why it's not slavic and we're</v>

2022
01:22:58.590 --> 01:22:59.580
<v Speaker 2>going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you say that,</v>

2023
01:22:59.581 --> 01:23:04.290
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's great parts of Cleveland</v>
<v Speaker 2>each on in this area and the area.</v>

2024
01:23:05.070 --> 01:23:06.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorry to be climbing the area that I</v>

2025
01:23:06.790 --> 01:23:07.170
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2026
01:23:07.170 --> 01:23:08.003
<v Speaker 2>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I should have,</v>

2027
01:23:08.080 --> 01:23:09.790
<v Speaker 2>it was this area of west Cleveland</v>
<v Speaker 2>called Slavic city.</v>

2028
01:23:09.791 --> 01:23:13.570
<v Speaker 2>Not the hot kick your ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Clearly not the whole Cleveland is like,</v>

2029
01:23:13.571 --> 01:23:15.730
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that dude who had a t shirt at one of</v>

2030
01:23:15.731 --> 01:23:18.010
<v Speaker 2>my shows that I put on my instagram.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People in her death.</v>

2031
01:23:18.670 --> 01:23:21.520
<v Speaker 2>They're fucking serious about Cleveland.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have the heavyweight champion of</v>

2032
01:23:21.521 --> 01:23:23.590
<v Speaker 2>the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>steep vimeo chick who lives in</v>

2033
01:23:23.591 --> 01:23:24.760
<v Speaker 2>Cleveland.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're,</v>

2034
01:23:25.250 --> 01:23:27.180
<v Speaker 2>this street is one of those</v>
<v Speaker 2>respectfully,</v>

2035
01:23:27.190 --> 01:23:29.410
<v Speaker 2>not representative of all of Cleveland.</v>

2036
01:23:29.410 --> 01:23:30.430
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2037
01:23:30.520 --> 01:23:32.020
<v Speaker 2>I mean you can find a place like that in</v>
<v Speaker 2>la.</v>

2038
01:23:32.021 --> 01:23:33.540
<v Speaker 2>I'll take you to skid row right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh sure,</v>

2039
01:23:33.690 --> 01:23:35.050
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We could just go to beverly hills.</v>

2040
01:23:35.220 --> 01:23:36.640
<v Speaker 2>You're your choice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>

2041
01:23:36.641 --> 01:23:38.260
<v Speaker 2>It's not an Einstein,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>

2042
01:23:38.261 --> 01:23:39.850
<v Speaker 2>just just about the street that there</v>
<v Speaker 2>was this,</v>

2043
01:23:41.020 --> 01:23:43.300
<v Speaker 2>we're going down the street and a third</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the house has been demolished.</v>

2044
01:23:43.780 --> 01:23:46.780
<v Speaker 2>A third were abandoned or third store</v>
<v Speaker 2>have people living in them.</v>

2045
01:23:46.781 --> 01:23:48.910
<v Speaker 2>Some of them like literally behind</v>
<v Speaker 2>barbed wire.</v>

2046
01:23:48.911 --> 01:23:50.830
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sounds like a children's math problem.</v>

2047
01:23:51.890 --> 01:23:54.460
<v Speaker 2>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not 15 people live in this place.</v>

2048
01:23:54.570 --> 01:23:56.880
<v Speaker 2>I knew heroin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they've walked the streets,</v>

2049
01:23:56.890 --> 01:24:00.520
<v Speaker 2>how long does it take care I oxycontin</v>
<v Speaker 2>15 people live in that place.</v>

2050
01:24:00.521 --> 01:24:02.410
<v Speaker 2>They're on antidepressants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who's happier?</v>

2051
01:24:03.700 --> 01:24:06.010
<v Speaker 2>So we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we knocked on one door and there was a</v>

2052
01:24:06.011 --> 01:24:08.290
<v Speaker 2>woman who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from looking at how I would have guessed</v>

2053
01:24:08.291 --> 01:24:09.220
<v Speaker 2>was 60,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2054
01:24:09.250 --> 01:24:11.740
<v Speaker 2>She was actually the same age as me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was 37 at the time.</v>

2055
01:24:12.280 --> 01:24:14.080
<v Speaker 2>And she was very articulate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was,</v>

2056
01:24:14.081 --> 01:24:17.560
<v Speaker 2>she knew that she knew a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was really fucking angry.</v>

2057
01:24:17.950 --> 01:24:21.490
<v Speaker 2>She was raging.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

2058
01:24:21.970 --> 01:24:24.250
<v Speaker 2>she made this verbal slip that's really</v>
<v Speaker 2>stayed with me.</v>

2059
01:24:24.910 --> 01:24:26.110
<v Speaker 2>I thought about it while you're speaking</v>
<v Speaker 2>earlier,</v>

2060
01:24:27.310 --> 01:24:30.010
<v Speaker 2>she talked about the area used to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>like for parents and grandparents,</v>

2061
01:24:30.011 --> 01:24:32.470
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she meant to say,</v>

2062
01:24:32.800 --> 01:24:35.080
<v Speaker 2>when I was young,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what she actually said is when I was</v>

2063
01:24:35.081 --> 01:24:36.880
<v Speaker 2>alive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2064
01:24:37.330 --> 01:24:38.380
<v Speaker 2>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how she feels,</v>

2065
01:24:38.381 --> 01:24:39.910
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>She feels like she has died.</v>

2066
01:24:40.480 --> 01:24:43.440
<v Speaker 2>And it made me think about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this other researchers think about that.</v>

2067
01:24:43.441 --> 01:24:43.980
<v Speaker 2>She was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

2068
01:24:43.980 --> 01:24:46.810
<v Speaker 2>I think relates to the individual versus</v>
<v Speaker 2>collective debate that we've kind of</v>

2069
01:24:46.811 --> 01:24:51.010
<v Speaker 2>been touching on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So native American groups in Canada,</v>

2070
01:24:51.100 --> 01:24:54.850
<v Speaker 2>they call them first nations groups have</v>
<v Speaker 2>really high suicide rates.</v>

2071
01:24:54.850 --> 01:24:55.860
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2072
01:24:56.140 --> 01:24:58.660
<v Speaker 2>and this professor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to interview person,</v>

2073
01:24:58.661 --> 01:25:01.370
<v Speaker 2>Michael Chandler did this really big</v>
<v Speaker 2>research on this because what we</v>

2074
01:25:01.520 --> 01:25:04.120
<v Speaker 2>realized is 196 first nations groups in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Canada,</v>

2075
01:25:04.390 --> 01:25:06.580
<v Speaker 2>some of them have really high suicide</v>
<v Speaker 2>and some have none.</v>

2076
01:25:06.790 --> 01:25:07.360
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>

2077
01:25:07.360 --> 01:25:10.420
<v Speaker 2>why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So He'd spent 10 years researching this,</v>

2078
01:25:10.870 --> 01:25:13.540
<v Speaker 2>discovered loads of things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But one of the things he discovered was</v>

2079
01:25:14.740 --> 01:25:18.220
<v Speaker 2>some of these groups have basically been</v>
<v Speaker 2>able to fight to regain control of their</v>

2080
01:25:18.221 --> 01:25:18.911
<v Speaker 2>community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2081
01:25:18.911 --> 01:25:21.760
<v Speaker 2>They rebuilt their language,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've rebuilt their scope,</v>

2082
01:25:21.770 --> 01:25:24.220
<v Speaker 2>control of the schools and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

2083
01:25:24.790 --> 01:25:28.510
<v Speaker 2>And some have just been so cut down that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they haven't been able to do that.</v>

2084
01:25:29.200 --> 01:25:32.050
<v Speaker 2>Suicide rate correlates really tightly</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the amount of control they were</v>

2085
01:25:32.051 --> 01:25:35.020
<v Speaker 2>able to regain over the community in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of meaning that you find in your</v>

2086
01:25:35.021 --> 01:25:36.310
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's about meaning,</v>

2087
01:25:36.340 --> 01:25:38.260
<v Speaker 2>it's about having a story about who you</v>
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>

2088
01:25:38.500 --> 01:25:41.530
<v Speaker 2>It's about having social connections</v>
<v Speaker 2>around you so you're not alone.</v>

2089
01:25:41.531 --> 01:25:43.570
<v Speaker 2>You're part of something bigger than any</v>
<v Speaker 2>side.</v>

2090
01:25:43.690 --> 01:25:44.590
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think when you,</v>

2091
01:25:44.591 --> 01:25:45.760
<v Speaker 2>when we were talking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought about that when,</v>

2092
01:25:45.761 --> 01:25:46.594
<v Speaker 2>when you were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2093
01:25:46.830 --> 01:25:48.400
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you like to do?</v>

2094
01:25:48.401 --> 01:25:50.890
<v Speaker 2>What should you do if someone's</v>
<v Speaker 2>listening to this and they're lonely and</v>

2095
01:25:50.891 --> 01:25:51.491
<v Speaker 2>isolated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2096
01:25:51.491 --> 01:25:55.330
<v Speaker 2>because we're such a fractured society</v>
<v Speaker 2>and because we find it so difficult to</v>

2097
01:25:55.331 --> 01:25:56.770
<v Speaker 2>be present with each other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2098
01:25:56.980 --> 01:25:57.480
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2099
01:25:57.480 --> 01:26:00.610
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the constant distraction and refracting</v>

2100
01:26:00.611 --> 01:26:02.260
<v Speaker 2>everything through screens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which makes us be like,</v>

2101
01:26:02.261 --> 01:26:03.440
<v Speaker 2>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can talk about some of that if you</v>

2102
01:26:03.441 --> 01:26:04.160
<v Speaker 2>want.</v>

2103
01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:06.390
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2104
01:26:06.460 --> 01:26:07.940
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the actually that,</v>

2105
01:26:07.970 --> 01:26:11.720
<v Speaker 3>that initial step is quite hard because</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're so broken up,</v>

2106
01:26:11.830 --> 01:26:13.820
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's not just the initial step,</v>

2107
01:26:13.850 --> 01:26:15.860
<v Speaker 3>it's you've gone too far in one</v>
<v Speaker 3>direction.</v>

2108
01:26:16.010 --> 01:26:17.210
<v Speaker 3>Like say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at it this way,</v>

2109
01:26:17.390 --> 01:26:19.700
<v Speaker 3>if we all started this neutral point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2110
01:26:20.060 --> 01:26:21.230
<v Speaker 3>And W,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2111
01:26:21.231 --> 01:26:25.000
<v Speaker 3>someone like Jamie does what he wants to</v>
<v Speaker 3>do and,</v>

2112
01:26:25.001 --> 01:26:28.900
<v Speaker 3>and finds a good path and starts going</v>
<v Speaker 3>in that direction and keeps improving as</v>

2113
01:26:28.910 --> 01:26:33.890
<v Speaker 3>life and then eventually is a happy</v>
<v Speaker 3>human being as an adult.</v>

2114
01:26:34.160 --> 01:26:36.500
<v Speaker 3>Or you have someone who goes the wrong</v>
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>

2115
01:26:36.590 --> 01:26:41.420
<v Speaker 3>They get addicted to food and cigarettes</v>
<v Speaker 3>and drugs and antidepressants and they</v>

2116
01:26:41.421 --> 01:26:45.260
<v Speaker 3>get into bad relationships and then they</v>
<v Speaker 3>have children that they have to take</v>

2117
01:26:45.261 --> 01:26:47.510
<v Speaker 3>care of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have a job that they hate and then</v>

2118
01:26:47.511 --> 01:26:51.440
<v Speaker 3>they find themselves at 37 years old</v>
<v Speaker 3>looking like they're 65 trying to figure</v>

2119
01:26:51.441 --> 01:26:52.400
<v Speaker 3>out how to get back.</v>

2120
01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:55.430
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've got to find a way to not just</v>

2121
01:26:55.460 --> 01:26:58.460
<v Speaker 3>move ahead,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but to get back to that neutral point,</v>

2122
01:26:58.740 --> 01:27:01.250
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have to go back in time over all</v>

2123
01:27:01.251 --> 01:27:05.030
<v Speaker 3>the shit they fucked up and they have a</v>
<v Speaker 3>far longer path.</v>

2124
01:27:05.180 --> 01:27:08.540
<v Speaker 3>So it's not an impossible path,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's a far longer path.</v>

2125
01:27:08.570 --> 01:27:12.140
<v Speaker 3>If you all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if everyone's going in a direction and</v>

2126
01:27:12.141 --> 01:27:16.520
<v Speaker 3>that direction is 25 miles away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you go 37 miles backwards,</v>

2127
01:27:16.760 --> 01:27:21.560
<v Speaker 3>you have to go sell 37 miles forward and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then the additional 25 miles.</v>

2128
01:27:21.860 --> 01:27:24.260
<v Speaker 3>That's the problem with people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They look at the,</v>

2129
01:27:24.261 --> 01:27:27.110
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the daunting nature of that task and</v>

2130
01:27:27.111 --> 01:27:30.230
<v Speaker 3>it's very intimidating to them and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't feel like they can make it.</v>

2131
01:27:30.410 --> 01:27:35.410
<v Speaker 3>They don't feel like they can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there is satisfaction and hope and</v>

2132
01:27:35.871 --> 01:27:39.350
<v Speaker 3>happiness and moving towards a positive</v>
<v Speaker 3>direction.</v>

2133
01:27:40.010 --> 01:27:43.280
<v Speaker 3>And that's what people have to realize.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not about a goal.</v>

2134
01:27:43.460 --> 01:27:48.320
<v Speaker 3>It's about the journey being a positive</v>
<v Speaker 3>journey and the feeling that you get of</v>

2135
01:27:48.321 --> 01:27:51.650
<v Speaker 3>improving your life incrementally on a</v>
<v Speaker 3>daily basis.</v>

2136
01:27:52.130 --> 01:27:55.550
<v Speaker 3>And it's also the mindset that you carry</v>
<v Speaker 3>with you on that journey.</v>

2137
01:27:55.850 --> 01:27:58.160
<v Speaker 3>You can't look at yourself and go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

2138
01:27:58.161 --> 01:28:01.160
<v Speaker 3>why am I not successful yet?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why am I not rich?</v>

2139
01:28:01.161 --> 01:28:03.290
<v Speaker 3>Why am I not this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why am I not that?</v>

2140
01:28:03.560 --> 01:28:06.410
<v Speaker 3>You have to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am better than I was yesterday.</v>

2141
01:28:06.590 --> 01:28:09.830
<v Speaker 3>Tomorrow will be better than I am today</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm on the right path.</v>

2142
01:28:10.040 --> 01:28:14.540
<v Speaker 3>And there is a lot of deep satisfaction</v>
<v Speaker 3>and happiness and being on the right</v>

2143
01:28:14.541 --> 01:28:15.620
<v Speaker 3>path.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

2144
01:28:15.621 --> 01:28:17.780
<v Speaker 3>if you're a person who wants to be an</v>
<v Speaker 3>author,</v>

2145
01:28:17.930 --> 01:28:22.930
<v Speaker 3>but instead you're an accountant every</v>
<v Speaker 3>day you spend not feeding that idea that</v>

2146
01:28:23.421 --> 01:28:26.600
<v Speaker 3>you can be an author is going to chew</v>
<v Speaker 3>away at you,</v>

2147
01:28:26.601 --> 01:28:30.470
<v Speaker 3>it's going to chip away at you and it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to move you away from that neutral</v>

2148
01:28:30.471 --> 01:28:30.980
<v Speaker 3>point.</v>

2149
01:28:30.980 --> 01:28:32.180
<v Speaker 3>Many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many miles.</v>

2150
01:28:33.320 --> 01:28:35.240
<v Speaker 3>I totally agree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I totally agree with you and I think</v>

2151
01:28:35.241 --> 01:28:38.240
<v Speaker 3>that the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that thing about when people realize</v>

2152
01:28:38.241 --> 01:28:40.210
<v Speaker 3>they have agency,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's one of the most,</v>

2153
01:28:40.840 --> 01:28:42.710
<v Speaker 3>especially,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it goes back to what was saying</v>

2154
01:28:42.711 --> 01:28:44.060
<v Speaker 3>about work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you will,</v>

2155
01:28:44.080 --> 01:28:46.850
<v Speaker 3>spending nine hours a day being</v>
<v Speaker 3>controlled,</v>

2156
01:28:47.150 --> 01:28:48.740
<v Speaker 3>one of the things you do to get through</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

2157
01:28:48.741 --> 01:28:50.930
<v Speaker 3>is it a process of internal deadening?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2158
01:28:50.931 --> 01:28:53.360
<v Speaker 3>I remember talking to just a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the guy in the paint store,</v>

2159
01:28:53.361 --> 01:28:54.600
<v Speaker 3>he would say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know how it would just get home,</v>

2160
01:28:54.650 --> 01:28:58.340
<v Speaker 3>go home,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and initially it was alcohol and then</v>

2161
01:28:58.341 --> 01:29:01.470
<v Speaker 3>later oxy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he would just want to numb himself.</v>

2162
01:29:01.500 --> 01:29:01.980
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

2163
01:29:01.980 --> 01:29:04.230
<v Speaker 1>Because there's an internal deadline you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to do to get through that.</v>

2164
01:29:04.231 --> 01:29:07.140
<v Speaker 1>Which is why I think one of the key</v>
<v Speaker 1>aspects that I talk about those</v>

2165
01:29:07.141 --> 01:29:08.760
<v Speaker 1>connections is this transformation of</v>
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>

2166
01:29:08.761 --> 01:29:12.900
<v Speaker 1>If the thing that most people are doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of the time is making 87% of us</v>

2167
01:29:12.920 --> 01:29:15.900
<v Speaker 1>would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't like it at the best bat.</v>

2168
01:29:16.170 --> 01:29:18.000
<v Speaker 1>You've got to go to the heart of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2169
01:29:18.360 --> 01:29:20.940
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know we're talking about margins</v>

2170
01:29:20.941 --> 01:29:23.190
<v Speaker 1>or change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People who set up that bike store in</v>

2171
01:29:23.191 --> 01:29:25.110
<v Speaker 1>Baltimore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were working class people.</v>

2172
01:29:25.320 --> 01:29:27.660
<v Speaker 1>You know who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who I'd not had fancy educations.</v>

2173
01:29:27.870 --> 01:29:29.730
<v Speaker 1>They set up a democratic cooperative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2174
01:29:29.900 --> 01:29:30.490
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

2175
01:29:30.490 --> 01:29:33.180
<v Speaker 1>they transformed their lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they were a good example of people</v>

2176
01:29:33.181 --> 01:29:35.790
<v Speaker 1>who appear to have a relatively limited</v>
<v Speaker 1>margin.</v>

2177
01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:37.950
<v Speaker 1>They were low wage workers in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>

2178
01:29:37.951 --> 01:29:40.800
<v Speaker 1>in a low wage industry who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2179
01:29:40.860 --> 01:29:42.600
<v Speaker 1>have made this transition.</v>

2180
01:29:42.600 --> 01:29:46.260
<v Speaker 1>So I'm certainly not saying that people</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't make these transitions even in</v>

2181
01:29:46.261 --> 01:29:48.390
<v Speaker 1>difficult circumstances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They absolutely can.</v>

2182
01:29:48.720 --> 01:29:49.770
<v Speaker 1>I just think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2183
01:29:49.800 --> 01:29:51.610
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I'll think about the,</v>

2184
01:29:51.611 --> 01:29:53.460
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the farmer in the field in Cambodia,</v>

2185
01:29:53.461 --> 01:29:55.560
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whose legs blown off and he's in this</v>

2186
01:29:55.561 --> 01:29:59.190
<v Speaker 1>field and it's agony.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He needed to change his life,</v>

2187
01:29:59.191 --> 01:30:01.050
<v Speaker 1>but he also needed someone to buy him a</v>
<v Speaker 1>cow.</v>

2188
01:30:01.200 --> 01:30:02.910
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He couldn't have bought that couch on</v>

2189
01:30:02.911 --> 01:30:04.640
<v Speaker 1>his own and that situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2190
01:30:05.250 --> 01:30:07.370
<v Speaker 1>he would be an illustration or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2191
01:30:07.970 --> 01:30:09.540
<v Speaker 1>or the rats in rat park.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2192
01:30:10.740 --> 01:30:13.830
<v Speaker 1>If you're in that isolated cage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's not a great example because</v>

2193
01:30:13.850 --> 01:30:15.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rat can't leave the cage.</v>

2194
01:30:15.641 --> 01:30:17.760
<v Speaker 1>Whereas you could argue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you see the point I'm making.</v>

2195
01:30:17.810 --> 01:30:19.710
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could attribute it just to</v>

2196
01:30:19.711 --> 01:30:21.690
<v Speaker 1>individual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know this is not what you're doing,</v>

2197
01:30:21.920 --> 01:30:23.930
<v Speaker 1>but I think some people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2198
01:30:24.120 --> 01:30:26.850
<v Speaker 1>attribute this just to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2199
01:30:26.910 --> 01:30:27.750
<v Speaker 1>is definitely what you're saying.</v>

2200
01:30:27.750 --> 01:30:30.120
<v Speaker 1>But just to individual weakness or</v>
<v Speaker 1>individual failing,</v>

2201
01:30:30.300 --> 01:30:33.680
<v Speaker 1>what I think that the identity is</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychology is a significant component of</v>

2202
01:30:33.690 --> 01:30:36.720
<v Speaker 1>that alongside other components.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think of it that way at all.</v>

2203
01:30:36.750 --> 01:30:40.360
<v Speaker 1>I think I think of it as poor choices.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think of it as individual film.</v>

2204
01:30:40.361 --> 01:30:42.990
<v Speaker 1>I've made many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many poor choices in my life.</v>

2205
01:30:43.200 --> 01:30:46.590
<v Speaker 1>Here's one of the big ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could tell people because there's a</v>

2206
01:30:46.591 --> 01:30:49.560
<v Speaker 1>lot of people that are listening to this</v>
<v Speaker 1>at various stages of their life.</v>

2207
01:30:49.890 --> 01:30:53.400
<v Speaker 1>If you're young and you have an open</v>
<v Speaker 1>future,</v>

2208
01:30:53.401 --> 01:30:56.020
<v Speaker 1>you don't have massive obligations and</v>
<v Speaker 1>debt and all the,</v>

2209
01:30:56.021 --> 01:30:58.050
<v Speaker 1>all the different things that become a</v>
<v Speaker 1>real hindrance.</v>

2210
01:30:58.051 --> 01:31:01.770
<v Speaker 1>As you get older,</v>
<v Speaker 1>move towards a direction that is</v>

2211
01:31:01.771 --> 01:31:04.640
<v Speaker 1>attractive to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do not move towards a direction that is</v>

2212
01:31:04.650 --> 01:31:06.060
<v Speaker 1>safe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't do it.</v>

2213
01:31:06.370 --> 01:31:09.660
<v Speaker 1>Because if you do do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you just take that safe job and then</v>

2214
01:31:09.661 --> 01:31:12.150
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of people that will know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people can do that.</v>

2215
01:31:12.330 --> 01:31:16.830
<v Speaker 1>That is a bullshit stupid way to think</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that will fuck you that that way to</v>

2216
01:31:16.831 --> 01:31:20.460
<v Speaker 1>think we'll fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can do what you do,</v>

2217
01:31:20.700 --> 01:31:23.220
<v Speaker 1>what you choose to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can get better at things.</v>

2218
01:31:23.360 --> 01:31:27.840
<v Speaker 1>If what you choose to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can move forward and try to figure</v>

2219
01:31:27.841 --> 01:31:30.900
<v Speaker 1>out a way to carve a path through that</v>
<v Speaker 1>life and it's not going to be easy,</v>

2220
01:31:30.901 --> 01:31:35.460
<v Speaker 1>but nothing worth doing is easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this idea that it'll give you want</v>

2221
01:31:35.461 --> 01:31:38.340
<v Speaker 1>to just do construction if that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>appealing to you,</v>

2222
01:31:38.341 --> 01:31:40.830
<v Speaker 1>you would like to just be a laborer and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

2223
01:31:40.831 --> 01:31:42.990
<v Speaker 1>there's look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a need for that in society,</v>

2224
01:31:42.991 --> 01:31:44.580
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't bother you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2225
01:31:44.581 --> 01:31:47.610
<v Speaker 1>but find out what bothers you and find</v>
<v Speaker 1>out what you enjoy.</v>

2226
01:31:47.790 --> 01:31:50.100
<v Speaker 1>If you're a labor and you really want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be a songwriter,</v>

2227
01:31:50.101 --> 01:31:52.290
<v Speaker 1>well you better fucking chase that</v>
<v Speaker 1>songwriting shit.</v>

2228
01:31:52.500 --> 01:31:54.630
<v Speaker 1>You better do it because if you don't do</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

2229
01:31:54.631 --> 01:31:57.930
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to be a 60 year old man</v>
<v Speaker 1>sitting around just depressed and</v>

2230
01:31:57.931 --> 01:32:00.010
<v Speaker 1>crying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then maybe you call</v>

2231
01:32:00.010 --> 01:32:03.660
<v Speaker 2>your friend up who does do that for a</v>
<v Speaker 2>living and he's having a great time and</v>

2232
01:32:03.820 --> 01:32:07.330
<v Speaker 2>he just released his new album and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>both started out together in high school</v>

2233
01:32:07.331 --> 01:32:10.650
<v Speaker 2>and now here you are at different stages</v>
<v Speaker 2>of your life and you,</v>

2234
01:32:10.651 --> 01:32:13.810
<v Speaker 2>you haven't pursued your interest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you haven't pursued your passion,</v>

2235
01:32:13.811 --> 01:32:15.490
<v Speaker 2>you haven't pursued what you really want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do.</v>

2236
01:32:15.890 --> 01:32:17.560
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to endorse every word you just said,</v>

2237
01:32:17.650 --> 01:32:21.430
<v Speaker 2>I would just add a layer alongside it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

2238
01:32:21.880 --> 01:32:25.090
<v Speaker 2>and we should change our society so</v>
<v Speaker 2>fewer people get trapped and more people</v>

2239
01:32:25.450 --> 01:32:28.330
<v Speaker 2>at the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people feel we want to be</v>

2240
01:32:28.331 --> 01:32:30.070
<v Speaker 2>giving people trampolines up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2241
01:32:30.100 --> 01:32:31.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think universal basic income is</v>

2242
01:32:31.961 --> 01:32:34.090
<v Speaker 2>probably a way that that's going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>start happening.</v>

2243
01:32:34.110 --> 01:32:35.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that can happen.</v>

2244
01:32:35.620 --> 01:32:38.170
<v Speaker 2>That can help a lot of people where your</v>
<v Speaker 2>basic needs,</v>

2245
01:32:38.171 --> 01:32:40.120
<v Speaker 2>your food is taken care of.</v>

2246
01:32:40.330 --> 01:32:43.030
<v Speaker 2>And I think President Obama talks about</v>
<v Speaker 2>this towards the end of his term,</v>

2247
01:32:43.031 --> 01:32:44.440
<v Speaker 2>partly because he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2248
01:32:44.690 --> 01:32:46.300
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually I don't attribute this to him.</v>

2249
01:32:46.301 --> 01:32:47.860
<v Speaker 2>I can't move.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said it made this point in this way,</v>

2250
01:32:47.861 --> 01:32:50.770
<v Speaker 2>but it was interviewed wired magazine</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he said he thinks this will have to</v>

2251
01:32:50.771 --> 01:32:54.070
<v Speaker 2>happen in the next 20 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Partly because of the extraordinary</v>

2252
01:32:54.071 --> 01:32:58.270
<v Speaker 2>disruption that's coming to the economy</v>
<v Speaker 2>through robotization automation.</v>

2253
01:32:58.271 --> 01:33:01.420
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Elon Musk said that recently as well.</v>

2254
01:33:01.450 --> 01:33:02.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I think Elan Musk is saying it for</v>

2255
01:33:02.840 --> 01:33:05.140
<v Speaker 2>slightly different motive and that he</v>
<v Speaker 2>knows the pitch books are going to come</v>

2256
01:33:05.141 --> 01:33:06.640
<v Speaker 2>from people like him and Mark</v>
<v Speaker 2>Zuckerberg.</v>

2257
01:33:06.641 --> 01:33:09.730
<v Speaker 2>The anger is going to be directed at</v>
<v Speaker 2>Silicon Valley if there isn't a</v>

2258
01:33:09.731 --> 01:33:11.920
<v Speaker 2>universal basic income.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure they have genuine concern for</v>

2259
01:33:11.921 --> 01:33:13.500
<v Speaker 2>people as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think the,</v>

2260
01:33:13.510 --> 01:33:16.150
<v Speaker 2>so you think that's really why he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's saying that,</v>

2261
01:33:16.690 --> 01:33:20.710
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe I'm just more cynical because they</v>

2262
01:33:20.711 --> 01:33:21.910
<v Speaker 2>just make so much money.</v>

2263
01:33:22.450 --> 01:33:23.890
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember who said that.</v>

2264
01:33:23.891 --> 01:33:24.724
<v Speaker 2>Someone said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2265
01:33:24.730 --> 01:33:27.640
<v Speaker 2>the path the economies are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's going to be seven tech</v>

2266
01:33:27.641 --> 01:33:30.040
<v Speaker 2>billionaires and everyone else employed</v>
<v Speaker 2>to give them massages.</v>

2267
01:33:30.041 --> 01:33:32.830
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think there's something going on</v>

2268
01:33:32.831 --> 01:33:34.600
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is I think they know at some level</v>

2269
01:33:34.601 --> 01:33:38.230
<v Speaker 2>if they don't start providing some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the society doesn't start providing</v>

2270
01:33:38.231 --> 01:33:41.020
<v Speaker 2>some baseline of security,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forget the figure.</v>

2271
01:33:41.021 --> 01:33:44.200
<v Speaker 2>I think 3 million people in the United</v>
<v Speaker 2>States make a living through driving</v>

2272
01:33:44.920 --> 01:33:47.320
<v Speaker 2>that's not going to exist in 10 years</v>
<v Speaker 2>from now probably right.</v>

2273
01:33:47.440 --> 01:33:50.140
<v Speaker 2>Self driving cars are likely to just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's going to be gone,</v>

2274
01:33:50.210 --> 01:33:53.150
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That that's an extraordinary disruption</v>

2275
01:33:53.151 --> 01:33:54.640
<v Speaker 2>to the economy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are mostly men.</v>

2276
01:33:54.740 --> 01:33:58.660
<v Speaker 2>They're mostly men with low educational</v>
<v Speaker 2>achievement attainments for various</v>

2277
01:33:58.661 --> 01:34:00.040
<v Speaker 2>reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot which are not their fault.</v>

2278
01:34:00.400 --> 01:34:01.900
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2279
01:34:01.970 --> 01:34:03.730
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's devastating,</v>

2280
01:34:03.731 --> 01:34:05.260
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think you're right,</v>

2281
01:34:05.261 --> 01:34:09.700
<v Speaker 2>the universal basic income is one of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>important strategies that can,</v>

2282
01:34:09.760 --> 01:34:10.660
<v Speaker 2>that can kind of deal with that.</v>

2283
01:34:10.660 --> 01:34:12.200
<v Speaker 2>But I think this comes back to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you,</v>

2284
01:34:12.220 --> 01:34:16.390
<v Speaker 2>you've got your going back to think that</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is a kind of recurring theme in</v>

2285
01:34:16.391 --> 01:34:17.380
<v Speaker 2>this conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

2286
01:34:18.730 --> 01:34:20.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for both my books for chasing the scream</v>

2287
01:34:20.531 --> 01:34:22.840
<v Speaker 2>and pulse connections can addiction and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it depression,</v>

2288
01:34:22.841 --> 01:34:26.230
<v Speaker 2>anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Both of them required me to go all over</v>

2289
01:34:26.231 --> 01:34:29.110
<v Speaker 2>the world and just look at really</v>
<v Speaker 2>different places that do things really</v>

2290
01:34:29.111 --> 01:34:31.360
<v Speaker 2>differently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there was some things that just</v>

2291
01:34:31.361 --> 01:34:32.710
<v Speaker 2>Rickard for both,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2292
01:34:32.950 --> 01:34:35.650
<v Speaker 2>Give example with addiction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the places that have most reduced</v>

2293
01:34:35.651 --> 01:34:39.590
<v Speaker 2>addiction have not been the places that</v>
<v Speaker 2>have said this is an attributing this to</v>

2294
01:34:39.591 --> 01:34:42.550
<v Speaker 2>you very clearly are not saying this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but people whose the places that have</v>

2295
01:34:42.551 --> 01:34:45.100
<v Speaker 2>said this is a problem for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>individual and the individual needs to</v>

2296
01:34:45.101 --> 01:34:48.070
<v Speaker 2>fucking sort themselves out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a massive and growing addiction</v>

2297
01:34:48.071 --> 01:34:49.630
<v Speaker 2>crisis from gets worse and worse.</v>

2298
01:34:49.900 --> 01:34:51.550
<v Speaker 2>The places that I went to where they</v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

2299
01:34:51.551 --> 01:34:54.100
<v Speaker 2>actually this is a collective problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need a collective solution.</v>

2300
01:34:54.520 --> 01:34:56.470
<v Speaker 2>We're very different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Portugal for example,</v>

2301
01:34:56.471 --> 01:34:59.060
<v Speaker 2>in the year two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how one of the worst drug problems in</v>

2302
01:34:59.061 --> 01:34:59.894
<v Speaker 2>the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2303
01:35:00.140 --> 01:35:02.330
<v Speaker 2>1% of the population was addicted to</v>
<v Speaker 2>heroin.</v>

2304
01:35:02.331 --> 01:35:05.750
<v Speaker 2>It was incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every year the problem got worse as they</v>

2305
01:35:05.751 --> 01:35:07.940
<v Speaker 2>tried the American way more and more</v>
<v Speaker 2>rested,</v>

2306
01:35:07.941 --> 01:35:09.590
<v Speaker 2>more people in prison,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more people.</v>

2307
01:35:09.950 --> 01:35:13.250
<v Speaker 2>And one day the prime minister and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>leader of the opposition got together</v>

2308
01:35:13.251 --> 01:35:14.090
<v Speaker 2>and they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2309
01:35:14.091 --> 01:35:15.440
<v Speaker 2>we can't go on like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2310
01:35:15.441 --> 01:35:17.960
<v Speaker 2>We can't have ever more people in our</v>
<v Speaker 2>contributing data to heroin.</v>

2311
01:35:17.961 --> 01:35:20.360
<v Speaker 2>Where are we going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was quite bold thing.</v>

2312
01:35:20.510 --> 01:35:22.610
<v Speaker 2>They set up a panel led by an amazing</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2313
01:35:22.611 --> 01:35:24.470
<v Speaker 2>I got to know doctor [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2314
01:35:24.800 --> 01:35:26.630
<v Speaker 2>and they said to this panel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you guys go away,</v>

2315
01:35:26.960 --> 01:35:30.200
<v Speaker 2>figure out what would actually solve</v>
<v Speaker 2>this and we've agreed in advance.</v>

2316
01:35:30.200 --> 01:35:31.820
<v Speaker 2>We'll do whatever you recommend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2317
01:35:32.360 --> 01:35:34.760
<v Speaker 2>So they go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'd be like if trump and chuck Schumer</v>

2318
01:35:34.761 --> 01:35:35.930
<v Speaker 2>and Nancy Polosi agreed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would,</v>

2319
01:35:35.960 --> 01:35:39.230
<v Speaker 2>everyone would abide by finding on this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they go away.</v>

2320
01:35:39.231 --> 01:35:41.510
<v Speaker 2>They look at all the evidence including</v>
<v Speaker 2>rat park loads of the things we've</v>

2321
01:35:41.511 --> 01:35:43.130
<v Speaker 2>talked about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They came back and said,</v>

2322
01:35:43.131 --> 01:35:46.250
<v Speaker 2>decriminalize all drugs from cannabis to</v>
<v Speaker 2>crack everything.</v>

2323
01:35:46.400 --> 01:35:48.020
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is the crucial next step.</v>

2324
01:35:48.290 --> 01:35:52.100
<v Speaker 2>Take all the money we currently spend on</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking people's lives up on arresting</v>

2325
01:35:52.101 --> 01:35:52.760
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shaming them,</v>

2326
01:35:52.760 --> 01:35:54.080
<v Speaker 2>stigmatizing them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>imprisoning them,</v>

2327
01:35:55.190 --> 01:35:57.170
<v Speaker 2>and spend it instead on turning their</v>
<v Speaker 2>lives around.</v>

2328
01:35:57.350 --> 01:35:59.840
<v Speaker 2>And interestingly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't really what we think of.</v>

2329
01:35:59.841 --> 01:36:01.430
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a little bit of residential</v>

2330
01:36:01.431 --> 01:36:04.010
<v Speaker 2>rehab.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of it was a big program of job</v>

2331
01:36:04.011 --> 01:36:06.710
<v Speaker 2>creation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They set up micro loans so people with</v>

2332
01:36:06.711 --> 01:36:09.770
<v Speaker 2>addiction problems could set up and run</v>
<v Speaker 2>small businesses about things they cared</v>

2333
01:36:09.771 --> 01:36:10.340
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

2334
01:36:10.340 --> 01:36:12.380
<v Speaker 2>They set up a big program,</v>
<v Speaker 2>subsidized work.</v>

2335
01:36:12.381 --> 01:36:13.580
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2336
01:36:13.940 --> 01:36:15.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say you've used to be a mechanic,</v>

2337
01:36:15.561 --> 01:36:17.810
<v Speaker 2>they go to a garage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they say if you employ this guy for a</v>

2338
01:36:17.810 --> 01:36:19.130
<v Speaker 2>year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll pay half his wages.</v>

2339
01:36:19.131 --> 01:36:20.780
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The results in Portugal have been</v>

2340
01:36:20.781 --> 01:36:22.640
<v Speaker 2>incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Couldn't the best scientific study</v>

2341
01:36:22.790 --> 01:36:25.850
<v Speaker 2>published in the British journal of</v>
<v Speaker 2>criminology injecting drug use fell by</v>

2342
01:36:25.851 --> 01:36:30.410
<v Speaker 2>more than 50% overdose deaths,</v>
<v Speaker 2>massively fell HIV massively fail.</v>

2343
01:36:30.680 --> 01:36:33.680
<v Speaker 2>One thing that was so striking there was</v>
<v Speaker 2>going around and speaking to people.</v>

2344
01:36:33.681 --> 01:36:36.260
<v Speaker 2>I mean one of the most moving into that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the chasing the scream is with them,</v>

2345
01:36:36.590 --> 01:36:39.530
<v Speaker 2>a guy called wildfit guerra who was the</v>
<v Speaker 2>top drug cop in Portugal,</v>

2346
01:36:40.040 --> 01:36:42.530
<v Speaker 2>and he led the opposition to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>decriminalization when it first</v>

2347
01:36:42.531 --> 01:36:43.310
<v Speaker 2>happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2348
01:36:43.310 --> 01:36:45.620
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is fucking madness.</v>

2349
01:36:45.650 --> 01:36:47.570
<v Speaker 2>We're going to have a massive explosion</v>
<v Speaker 2>in drug use.</v>

2350
01:36:48.110 --> 01:36:49.010
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be a nightmare.</v>

2351
01:36:49.010 --> 01:36:52.610
<v Speaker 2>And he said to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything I said would happen,</v>

2352
01:36:52.611 --> 01:36:54.860
<v Speaker 2>didn't happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and everything the other side said would</v>

2353
01:36:54.861 --> 01:36:55.694
<v Speaker 2>happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did.</v>

2354
01:36:55.700 --> 01:36:58.910
<v Speaker 2>And it talks about how he felt really</v>
<v Speaker 2>ashamed that it spent 20 years before</v>

2355
01:36:58.911 --> 01:37:00.810
<v Speaker 2>the decriminalization fucking people's</v>
<v Speaker 2>lives up.</v>

2356
01:37:01.040 --> 01:37:03.710
<v Speaker 2>And I think that goes to the debate that</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're talking about because that was now</v>

2357
01:37:03.711 --> 01:37:05.150
<v Speaker 2>that's individuals changing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2358
01:37:05.180 --> 01:37:08.060
<v Speaker 2>That's very clearly individual changing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>making better choices,</v>

2359
01:37:08.330 --> 01:37:10.670
<v Speaker 2>but they're making those better choices</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a context,</v>

2360
01:37:10.671 --> 01:37:13.250
<v Speaker 2>a context where the society,</v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of beating them down,</v>

2361
01:37:13.251 --> 01:37:14.840
<v Speaker 2>it's trying to lift them up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you see what I mean?</v>

2362
01:37:14.841 --> 01:37:15.560
<v Speaker 2>It's a very good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2363
01:37:15.560 --> 01:37:17.050
<v Speaker 3>good point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a very important point.</v>

2364
01:37:17.051 --> 01:37:20.320
<v Speaker 3>And what Portugal is done should be</v>
<v Speaker 3>studied by our country,</v>

2365
01:37:20.321 --> 01:37:23.860
<v Speaker 3>which is now falling right back into the</v>
<v Speaker 3>old Nancy Reagan.</v>

2366
01:37:23.861 --> 01:37:27.730
<v Speaker 3>Just say no bullshit days with Jeff</v>
<v Speaker 3>sessions at the helm of catastrophe.</v>

2367
01:37:27.760 --> 01:37:31.360
<v Speaker 3>He's a terrifying person in that regard</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause he's so ignorant as to what's</v>

2368
01:37:31.361 --> 01:37:32.470
<v Speaker 3>going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's so ignorant.</v>

2369
01:37:32.471 --> 01:37:34.420
<v Speaker 3>He's still calling marijuana gateway</v>
<v Speaker 3>drug.</v>

2370
01:37:34.480 --> 01:37:35.410
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a fool.</v>

2371
01:37:35.680 --> 01:37:36.491
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he really is.</v>

2372
01:37:36.491 --> 01:37:39.250
<v Speaker 3>And that the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the pattern is terrifying because</v>

2373
01:37:39.580 --> 01:37:42.730
<v Speaker 3>they're trying to call Kratom and opiate</v>
<v Speaker 3>right now.</v>

2374
01:37:42.760 --> 01:37:43.331
<v Speaker 3>There,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

2375
01:37:43.331 --> 01:37:48.331
<v Speaker 3>there's all sorts of a resistance to</v>
<v Speaker 3>what we know of as safe alternatives to</v>

2376
01:37:50.021 --> 01:37:54.220
<v Speaker 3>pharmaceutical medications like cbd.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's another one they're demonizing.</v>

2377
01:37:54.340 --> 01:37:56.100
<v Speaker 3>They want to categorize that with heroin</v>

2378
01:37:56.100 --> 01:37:58.530
<v Speaker 2>and cocaine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking terrifying.</v>

2379
01:37:58.560 --> 01:37:59.020
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2380
01:37:59.020 --> 01:38:01.530
<v Speaker 2>it's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very weird time because there's so much</v>

2381
01:38:01.531 --> 01:38:05.790
<v Speaker 2>evidence and so much science and so much</v>
<v Speaker 2>history when it comes to things like</v>

2382
01:38:05.791 --> 01:38:09.750
<v Speaker 2>Portugal where it's been successful to</v>
<v Speaker 2>decriminalize everything and spend the</v>

2383
01:38:09.751 --> 01:38:11.970
<v Speaker 2>money on treatment programs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're ignoring that.</v>

2384
01:38:12.240 --> 01:38:14.040
<v Speaker 2>They're ignoring that because it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>convenient.</v>

2385
01:38:14.250 --> 01:38:16.140
<v Speaker 2>You're so right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But my concern is it's not.</v>

2386
01:38:16.320 --> 01:38:18.990
<v Speaker 2>I've Jeff sessions is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could imagine what I think about</v>

2387
01:38:18.991 --> 01:38:21.390
<v Speaker 2>Jeff Sessions is disgusting and insane</v>
<v Speaker 2>what he saying.</v>

2388
01:38:21.990 --> 01:38:24.270
<v Speaker 2>But my worry is it's not a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2389
01:38:24.271 --> 01:38:25.620
<v Speaker 2>I've worried about jeff sessions</v>
<v Speaker 2>primarily,</v>

2390
01:38:25.621 --> 01:38:27.600
<v Speaker 2>but my other worry is it's not just jeff</v>
<v Speaker 2>sessions.</v>

2391
01:38:27.601 --> 01:38:30.470
<v Speaker 2>I actually think even our side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2392
01:38:31.620 --> 01:38:35.250
<v Speaker 2>when it comes to the opioid crisis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think had been talking about this and</v>

2393
01:38:35.251 --> 01:38:39.540
<v Speaker 2>quite quite the wrong way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it made me realize actually how deep</v>

2394
01:38:39.541 --> 01:38:42.930
<v Speaker 2>this Nancy Reagan's script is in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>culture that even liberals,</v>

2395
01:38:42.931 --> 01:38:45.450
<v Speaker 2>my side of politics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it basically been saying their story</v>

2396
01:38:45.451 --> 01:38:49.410
<v Speaker 2>about the pharmaceutical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the opioid crisis is basically evil drug</v>

2397
01:38:49.411 --> 01:38:51.810
<v Speaker 2>dealers came along,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they gave people these drugs,</v>

2398
01:38:51.811 --> 01:38:52.860
<v Speaker 2>they got accidentally hurt.</v>

2399
01:38:52.860 --> 01:38:54.810
<v Speaker 2>In this case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the evil drug dealers or the big Pharma,</v>

2400
01:38:55.200 --> 01:38:57.540
<v Speaker 2>they've got them accidentally hooked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2401
01:38:57.840 --> 01:38:59.760
<v Speaker 2>and that's why we have this crisis right</v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

2402
01:38:59.761 --> 01:39:01.240
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you can tell from our conversation</v>

2403
01:39:01.241 --> 01:39:03.150
<v Speaker 2>and antidepressants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot to criticize big farmer</v>

2404
01:39:03.151 --> 01:39:05.340
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm very critical of them.</v>

2405
01:39:05.580 --> 01:39:08.070
<v Speaker 2>But that story is just ridiculously</v>
<v Speaker 2>simple.</v>

2406
01:39:08.071 --> 01:39:10.530
<v Speaker 2>If that were true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>antidepressant prescriptions had been</v>

2407
01:39:10.531 --> 01:39:12.690
<v Speaker 2>given across the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2408
01:39:12.900 --> 01:39:15.270
<v Speaker 2>If that were true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would not make sense.</v>

2409
01:39:15.550 --> 01:39:19.860
<v Speaker 2>Now the opioid prescriptions are also</v>
<v Speaker 2>concentrated.</v>

2410
01:39:19.890 --> 01:39:24.600
<v Speaker 2>The opiate addictions are also</v>
<v Speaker 2>concentrated in the places where suicide</v>

2411
01:39:24.601 --> 01:39:26.760
<v Speaker 2>is highest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where depression is highest,</v>

2412
01:39:27.060 --> 01:39:30.120
<v Speaker 2>where of course it's some everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's a reason for that,</v>

2413
01:39:30.121 --> 01:39:30.931
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Angus Dayton,</v>

2414
01:39:30.931 --> 01:39:33.730
<v Speaker 2>the economist who studied this described</v>
<v Speaker 2>the opioid deaths,</v>

2415
01:39:33.770 --> 01:39:34.770
<v Speaker 2>despair,</v>
<v Speaker 2>deaths,</v>

2416
01:39:34.771 --> 01:39:38.140
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you go to the places where you turn,</v>

2417
01:39:38.230 --> 01:39:39.480
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're in the country and when I go to</v>

2418
01:39:39.500 --> 01:39:42.510
<v Speaker 2>places that have been most affected by</v>
<v Speaker 2>the opioid crisis,</v>

2419
01:39:43.140 --> 01:39:45.480
<v Speaker 2>what's going on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said he'd been deprived of the things</v>

2420
01:39:45.481 --> 01:39:47.820
<v Speaker 2>that make life meaningful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they want to be an Easter ties to all</v>

2421
01:39:47.821 --> 01:39:48.420
<v Speaker 2>the time.</v>

2422
01:39:48.420 --> 01:39:51.210
<v Speaker 2>There's a devastating line.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Marianne faithful.</v>

2423
01:39:51.211 --> 01:39:53.000
<v Speaker 2>He was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mick Jagger is best known for being Mick</v>

2424
01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:54.300
<v Speaker 2>Jagger's girlfriend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but kind of pisses me off cause thinks</v>

2425
01:39:54.340 --> 01:39:55.890
<v Speaker 2>she's even better than Mick Jagger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she was,</v>

2426
01:39:56.280 --> 01:39:58.280
<v Speaker 2>I know it was controversial.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Better than Mick Jagger.</v>

2427
01:39:58.281 --> 01:40:00.300
<v Speaker 2>There's controversial,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I best fucking conversations.</v>

2428
01:40:01.210 --> 01:40:02.280
<v Speaker 2>Shut it down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie.</v>

2429
01:40:02.610 --> 01:40:06.000
<v Speaker 2>So Marianne Faithfull had a heroin</v>
<v Speaker 2>addiction in the 60s when she was</v>

2430
01:40:06.001 --> 01:40:09.540
<v Speaker 2>homeless and she has this very</v>
<v Speaker 2>challenging line in her.</v>

2431
01:40:09.600 --> 01:40:11.280
<v Speaker 2>In her memoir,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she says something like,</v>

2432
01:40:11.610 --> 01:40:13.920
<v Speaker 2>heroin saved my life because if it</v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't the heroin,</v>

2433
01:40:13.921 --> 01:40:15.090
<v Speaker 2>I would have killed myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2434
01:40:15.660 --> 01:40:19.380
<v Speaker 2>And don't misunderstand what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Heroin is not a good solution to despair</v>

2435
01:40:19.700 --> 01:40:22.110
<v Speaker 2>if we want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if clearly for all sorts of very obvious</v>

2436
01:40:22.111 --> 01:40:24.960
<v Speaker 2>reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we want to understand why there's</v>

2437
01:40:24.961 --> 01:40:27.540
<v Speaker 2>been this huge increase in opiod use,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have to understand these things that</v>

2438
01:40:27.541 --> 01:40:29.610
<v Speaker 2>I'm writing about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His connections to the World Health</v>

2439
01:40:29.610 --> 01:40:31.770
<v Speaker 2>Organization is explaining this deep</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of dispatch.</v>

2440
01:40:31.980 --> 01:40:34.560
<v Speaker 2>And my worry is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause you're back to the worry about how</v>

2441
01:40:34.561 --> 01:40:36.300
<v Speaker 2>our side is getting it wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we've got jeff sessions getting it</v>

2442
01:40:36.301 --> 01:40:37.830
<v Speaker 2>wrong in the most obvious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>insane way,</v>

2443
01:40:37.850 --> 01:40:38.910
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2444
01:40:38.940 --> 01:40:41.810
<v Speaker 2>it's just we need to crack down on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mexicans and that will store it.</v>

2445
01:40:42.050 --> 01:40:44.310
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the United States has spent $1 trillion</v>

2446
01:40:45.120 --> 01:40:47.820
<v Speaker 2>on the war on drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's done it for a hundred years.</v>

2447
01:40:48.060 --> 01:40:51.090
<v Speaker 2>It's imprisoned more people than any</v>
<v Speaker 2>other country in human history.</v>

2448
01:40:51.091 --> 01:40:53.590
<v Speaker 2>And at the end of all that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you guys can't even keep drugs out of</v>

2449
01:40:53.591 --> 01:40:56.080
<v Speaker 2>your prisons where you pay people to</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we're on the fucking perimeter the</v>

2450
01:40:56.081 --> 01:40:57.970
<v Speaker 2>whole time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So good luck keeping them out of a</v>

2451
01:40:57.971 --> 01:40:59.710
<v Speaker 2>country with two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>3000 mile borders.</v>

2452
01:40:59.890 --> 01:41:03.910
<v Speaker 2>That is so ridiculous and so absurd that</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not just that.</v>

2453
01:41:03.911 --> 01:41:08.290
<v Speaker 2>It's why would you think that you could</v>
<v Speaker 2>tell a grown adult what they can and</v>

2454
01:41:08.291 --> 01:41:09.250
<v Speaker 2>can't do with their body?</v>

2455
01:41:09.310 --> 01:41:10.370
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>boss,</v>

2456
01:41:10.380 --> 01:41:12.390
<v Speaker 2>that really simple.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I'm,</v>

2457
01:41:12.391 --> 01:41:15.010
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure all of your listeners</v>
<v Speaker 2>agree with this on GSA or pretty much</v>

2458
01:41:15.011 --> 01:41:17.560
<v Speaker 2>all of them agree that on jeff sessions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I think more of them will be</v>

2459
01:41:17.561 --> 01:41:20.950
<v Speaker 2>tempted by.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll be the more liberal argument.</v>

2460
01:41:20.951 --> 01:41:22.720
<v Speaker 2>I says as the liberals are not attacking</v>
<v Speaker 2>liberals,</v>

2461
01:41:22.721 --> 01:41:24.130
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more liberal argument,</v>

2462
01:41:24.131 --> 01:41:27.420
<v Speaker 2>which is this simplistic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even Bernie Sanders who I love and would</v>

2463
01:41:27.421 --> 01:41:28.750
<v Speaker 2>have voted for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2464
01:41:28.840 --> 01:41:30.160
<v Speaker 2>well I think he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got this wrong,</v>

2465
01:41:30.161 --> 01:41:30.994
<v Speaker 2>which is the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2466
01:41:31.180 --> 01:41:33.400
<v Speaker 2>although I think Bernie Sanders has</v>
<v Speaker 2>politics would deal with some of the</v>

2467
01:41:33.401 --> 01:41:34.930
<v Speaker 2>deeper problems as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Clearly,</v>

2468
01:41:35.260 --> 01:41:38.140
<v Speaker 2>but there's this story that it's about</v>
<v Speaker 2>the drug companies.</v>

2469
01:41:38.260 --> 01:41:41.080
<v Speaker 2>We've got to look at the one place that</v>
<v Speaker 2>solved an opioid crisis.</v>

2470
01:41:41.081 --> 01:41:42.820
<v Speaker 2>If we talked about Portugal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the one other place.</v>

2471
01:41:43.090 --> 01:41:45.250
<v Speaker 2>So Switzerland,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a Swiss citizen,</v>

2472
01:41:45.251 --> 01:41:46.500
<v Speaker 2>come my dad's from there as well as</v>
<v Speaker 2>British,</v>

2473
01:41:46.520 --> 01:41:51.010
<v Speaker 2>obviously tristle until a massive heroin</v>
<v Speaker 2>problem in the 90s right?</v>

2474
01:41:51.010 --> 01:41:52.260
<v Speaker 2>Huge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Almost as you know,</v>

2475
01:41:52.270 --> 01:41:53.930
<v Speaker 2>not quite as bad as what's happening at</v>
<v Speaker 2>opioids say,</v>

2476
01:41:53.931 --> 01:41:58.931
<v Speaker 2>but it was massive and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Switzerland got this amazing kickass</v>

2477
01:41:59.441 --> 01:42:04.441
<v Speaker 2>female President Call Ruth Dreifuss to</v>
<v Speaker 2>explain to people that when you hear the</v>

2478
01:42:04.451 --> 01:42:07.570
<v Speaker 2>word legalization,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you picture is anarchy and chaos,</v>

2479
01:42:07.571 --> 01:42:10.840
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What we have now is anarchy and chaos.</v>

2480
01:42:10.990 --> 01:42:13.750
<v Speaker 2>When you prohibit drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you get is unknown criminals</v>

2481
01:42:13.870 --> 01:42:18.280
<v Speaker 2>selling unknown chemicals to unknown</v>
<v Speaker 2>drug users all in the dark filled with</v>

2482
01:42:18.281 --> 01:42:19.360
<v Speaker 2>violence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>disease and chaos.</v>

2483
01:42:19.570 --> 01:42:21.670
<v Speaker 2>What she proposed to do is legalized</v>
<v Speaker 2>heroin,</v>

2484
01:42:21.700 --> 01:42:23.140
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's important to understand that.</v>

2485
01:42:23.141 --> 01:42:24.910
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't mean it doesn't mean</v>

2486
01:42:24.911 --> 01:42:26.940
<v Speaker 2>there's like a heroin Ireland,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the cvs in,</v>

2487
01:42:26.941 --> 01:42:28.420
<v Speaker 2>in Switzerland,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2488
01:42:28.810 --> 01:42:30.820
<v Speaker 2>So different things that can be</v>
<v Speaker 2>legalized differently.</v>

2489
01:42:30.821 --> 01:42:33.490
<v Speaker 2>I don't know the rules in La,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm pretty sure you could legally if</v>

2490
01:42:33.491 --> 01:42:37.270
<v Speaker 2>you wanted to own a dog,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a monkey and a lion.</v>

2491
01:42:37.420 --> 01:42:38.740
<v Speaker 2>But I'm pretty sure the rules are</v>
<v Speaker 2>different,</v>

2492
01:42:38.741 --> 01:42:39.491
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2493
01:42:39.491 --> 01:42:40.950
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you're going on a monkey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're aligned.</v>

2494
01:42:40.951 --> 01:42:41.630
<v Speaker 2>But you could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2495
01:42:41.630 --> 01:42:44.260
<v Speaker 2>if you really wanted to one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you were reaching and you could get</v>

2496
01:42:44.261 --> 01:42:46.510
<v Speaker 2>them in Texas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Texas for something that you could do</v>

2497
01:42:46.511 --> 01:42:48.920
<v Speaker 2>whatever the fuck you want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>except you can't have pot in Texas.</v>

2498
01:42:49.280 --> 01:42:51.220
<v Speaker 2>Hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's pretty sure in Texas it's</v>

2499
01:42:51.221 --> 01:42:52.180
<v Speaker 2>licensed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you could,</v>

2500
01:42:52.181 --> 01:42:53.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're all legal,</v>

2501
01:42:53.501 --> 01:42:54.940
<v Speaker 2>but they're legal in different ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2502
01:42:55.270 --> 01:42:57.010
<v Speaker 2>And it's similar way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What Ruth Dreifuss,</v>

2503
01:42:57.011 --> 01:42:59.710
<v Speaker 2>the Swiss president was praising his</v>
<v Speaker 2>heroin should be legal,</v>

2504
01:42:59.711 --> 01:43:01.300
<v Speaker 2>but not in the way that alcohol is</v>
<v Speaker 2>legal.</v>

2505
01:43:01.301 --> 01:43:04.450
<v Speaker 2>So the way it works is if you've got</v>
<v Speaker 2>heroin problem in Switzerland,</v>

2506
01:43:04.630 --> 01:43:07.210
<v Speaker 2>you're assigned to a clinic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to the one in Geneva where the</v>

2507
01:43:07.211 --> 01:43:08.950
<v Speaker 2>former president now lives across the</v>
<v Speaker 2>street,</v>

2508
01:43:08.951 --> 01:43:12.130
<v Speaker 2>which tells you something and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

2509
01:43:12.150 --> 01:43:13.660
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to go early in the morning for</v>

2510
01:43:13.661 --> 01:43:14.410
<v Speaker 2>reasons I'll explain.</v>

2511
01:43:14.410 --> 01:43:16.860
<v Speaker 2>You're giving your heroin there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't take it out with you.</v>

2512
01:43:17.380 --> 01:43:19.690
<v Speaker 2>You've got to use it there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you leave and you go to your</v>

2513
01:43:19.691 --> 01:43:22.240
<v Speaker 2>job cause they give you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they do two things and it's the exact</v>

2514
01:43:22.241 --> 01:43:25.490
<v Speaker 2>opposite of what's been proposed in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>u s what's being priced in the USA is</v>

2515
01:43:25.900 --> 01:43:29.800
<v Speaker 2>stop prescribing and don't give support.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2516
01:43:29.801 --> 01:43:32.980
<v Speaker 2>Well they didn't think Switzerland is</v>
<v Speaker 2>exact opposite in Switzerland.</v>

2517
01:43:33.190 --> 01:43:35.590
<v Speaker 2>They'll give you the drug you were</v>
<v Speaker 2>addicted to and then they give you loads</v>

2518
01:43:35.591 --> 01:43:38.230
<v Speaker 2>of support to figure out why you're in</v>
<v Speaker 2>such pain in the first place.</v>

2519
01:43:38.380 --> 01:43:41.200
<v Speaker 2>That helped me get housing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They get your subsidized work.</v>

2520
01:43:41.500 --> 01:43:43.870
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they give you loads of therapy that you,</v>

2521
01:43:43.871 --> 01:43:46.150
<v Speaker 2>are you aware of a booger?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2522
01:43:46.151 --> 01:43:46.690
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2523
01:43:46.690 --> 01:43:49.870
<v Speaker 2>But that's probably one of the very best</v>
<v Speaker 2>ways for people to quit drugs,</v>

2524
01:43:50.440 --> 01:43:52.010
<v Speaker 2>especially some horrible drug.</v>

2525
01:43:52.190 --> 01:43:56.000
<v Speaker 1>And it's a ruthlessly introspective drug</v>
<v Speaker 1>that many,</v>

2526
01:43:56.001 --> 01:43:58.910
<v Speaker 1>many people have found great success and</v>
<v Speaker 1>kicking heroin,</v>

2527
01:43:58.911 --> 01:44:00.710
<v Speaker 1>cigarettes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>alcoholism,</v>

2528
01:44:01.210 --> 01:44:03.470
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting over past abuse.</v>

2529
01:44:03.500 --> 01:44:04.333
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is,</v>

2530
01:44:04.580 --> 01:44:08.570
<v Speaker 1>it's a long experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can last more than 24 hours.</v>

2531
01:44:08.900 --> 01:44:12.260
<v Speaker 1>Totally illegal in the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But a lot of people go to Mexico and do</v>

2532
01:44:12.261 --> 01:44:14.450
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've had very good friends that have</v>

2533
01:44:14.451 --> 01:44:19.330
<v Speaker 1>had problems with pills that went over</v>
<v Speaker 1>there and kicked him because of the Boga</v>

2534
01:44:19.500 --> 01:44:20.333
<v Speaker 1>does a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should,</v>

2535
01:44:20.990 --> 01:44:22.820
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you a purchases and intro to</v>
<v Speaker 1>doctor Gabriel.</v>

2536
01:44:22.821 --> 01:44:24.940
<v Speaker 1>Marta it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brenda don't really know who he is.</v>

2537
01:44:25.590 --> 01:44:27.920
<v Speaker 1>He would be a great guest for you as you</v>
<v Speaker 1>live in England and he lives in</v>

2538
01:44:27.921 --> 01:44:31.540
<v Speaker 1>Vancouver but he comes to La fellows in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should definitely talk to you,</v>

2539
01:44:31.580 --> 01:44:32.900
<v Speaker 1>recommend people look it's wet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the,</v>

2540
01:44:33.140 --> 01:44:35.210
<v Speaker 1>in terms of just to stay with the last</v>
<v Speaker 1>point about Switzerland,</v>

2541
01:44:35.211 --> 01:44:37.250
<v Speaker 1>because there was something really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it relates to a bike or in a</v>

2542
01:44:37.251 --> 01:44:38.084
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

2543
01:44:38.090 --> 01:44:40.940
<v Speaker 1>So one of things that really surprised</v>
<v Speaker 1>me and that spending time in that</v>

2544
01:44:40.941 --> 01:44:42.510
<v Speaker 1>clinic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember there's chief psychiatrist,</v>

2545
01:44:42.511 --> 01:44:47.330
<v Speaker 1>they doctor Rita Mangus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they will give you as they will give</v>

2546
01:44:47.331 --> 01:44:51.500
<v Speaker 1>you any dose you want except one that</v>
<v Speaker 1>will kill you and there is never any</v>

2547
01:44:51.501 --> 01:44:54.200
<v Speaker 1>pressure to cut back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which really surprised me.</v>

2548
01:44:54.201 --> 01:44:56.930
<v Speaker 1>So you could go to this clinic and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll dose you up with heroin.</v>

2549
01:44:57.090 --> 01:44:59.210
<v Speaker 1>They give you the heroin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to use it there.</v>

2550
01:44:59.270 --> 01:45:00.860
<v Speaker 1>You can't take it out with you because I</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't want them sell it.</v>

2551
01:45:00.861 --> 01:45:02.750
<v Speaker 1>People selling it on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also it's kind of bad ass.</v>

2552
01:45:02.780 --> 01:45:04.180
<v Speaker 1>You're monitored by a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by a,</v>

2553
01:45:04.200 --> 01:45:05.170
<v Speaker 1>by a nurse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

2554
01:45:05.171 --> 01:45:06.530
<v Speaker 1>but the results are pretty incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

2555
01:45:06.590 --> 01:45:07.510
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2556
01:45:07.850 --> 01:45:08.320
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2557
01:45:08.320 --> 01:45:09.170
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the headline,</v>

2558
01:45:09.210 --> 01:45:12.860
<v Speaker 1>most important factors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there have been zero heroin overdose</v>

2559
01:45:12.861 --> 01:45:16.270
<v Speaker 1>deaths on legal heroin in Switzerland in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 12 years that program has existed.</v>

2560
01:45:16.280 --> 01:45:20.240
<v Speaker 1>Has the ratio of people using to not</v>
<v Speaker 1>using,</v>

2561
01:45:20.270 --> 01:45:22.670
<v Speaker 1>how's it gone down?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really significant fall in heroin use</v>

2562
01:45:22.671 --> 01:45:25.930
<v Speaker 1>because of best researchers by Professor</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ambrose Oakton Hargan who's shown there</v>

2563
01:45:25.970 --> 01:45:30.170
<v Speaker 1>been no deaths in the legal program and</v>
<v Speaker 1>an enormous fallen deaths in the illegal</v>

2564
01:45:30.171 --> 01:45:32.150
<v Speaker 1>program and enormous spalding use</v>
<v Speaker 1>overall,</v>

2565
01:45:32.750 --> 01:45:34.900
<v Speaker 1>the various reasons I can talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the thing that blew my mind was so</v>

2566
01:45:34.901 --> 01:45:36.920
<v Speaker 1>they give them every day as they want</v>
<v Speaker 1>for as long as they want.</v>

2567
01:45:37.340 --> 01:45:37.911
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2568
01:45:37.911 --> 01:45:39.920
<v Speaker 1>but what we're told is that comes back</v>
<v Speaker 1>to chemical hooks.</v>

2569
01:45:40.130 --> 01:45:42.440
<v Speaker 1>What we're told is they'll just want</v>
<v Speaker 1>more and more for ethical.</v>

2570
01:45:42.441 --> 01:45:43.250
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2571
01:45:43.250 --> 01:45:47.390
<v Speaker 1>But actually what happens is almost</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone chooses to cut back over time</v>

2572
01:45:47.391 --> 01:45:47.931
<v Speaker 1>and stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2573
01:45:47.931 --> 01:45:49.760
<v Speaker 1>When I went in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there were like two people</v>

2574
01:45:49.761 --> 01:45:52.310
<v Speaker 1>who've been on the program at the stock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I said to doctor Manga,</v>

2575
01:45:52.311 --> 01:45:52.640
<v Speaker 1>who runs it?</v>

2576
01:45:52.640 --> 01:45:54.470
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How is this happening?</v>

2577
01:45:54.860 --> 01:45:56.030
<v Speaker 1>And she looked at me like I was an</v>
<v Speaker 1>idiot,</v>

2578
01:45:56.031 --> 01:45:57.530
<v Speaker 1>and she said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2579
01:45:58.280 --> 01:46:00.770
<v Speaker 1>people's lives get better and it's their</v>
<v Speaker 1>lives get better.</v>

2580
01:46:00.771 --> 01:46:02.300
<v Speaker 1>They don't want to be anesthetized so</v>
<v Speaker 1>much,</v>

2581
01:46:02.690 --> 01:46:04.910
<v Speaker 1>which seems almost stupidly obvious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2582
01:46:05.120 --> 01:46:09.310
<v Speaker 1>Goes right back to what you were saying</v>
<v Speaker 1>about antidepressants and people's</v>

2583
01:46:09.320 --> 01:46:12.230
<v Speaker 1>lives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the choice that you make and the</v>

2584
01:46:12.231 --> 01:46:15.350
<v Speaker 1>paths that you take and the people you</v>
<v Speaker 1>surround with and the happiness that you</v>

2585
01:46:15.351 --> 01:46:18.500
<v Speaker 1>feel from your community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's ultimately what leads to a</v>

2586
01:46:18.501 --> 01:46:21.020
<v Speaker 1>fulfilling life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you have all that,</v>

2587
01:46:21.021 --> 01:46:22.710
<v Speaker 1>why would you fuck it up with heroin?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2588
01:46:22.790 --> 01:46:27.230
<v Speaker 1>I think you're totally right that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole premise of lost connections is</v>

2589
01:46:27.290 --> 01:46:28.910
<v Speaker 1>becomes what song we were saying at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>start,</v>

2590
01:46:29.480 --> 01:46:31.730
<v Speaker 1>human beings have needs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2591
01:46:32.180 --> 01:46:35.460
<v Speaker 1>And if your needs are being met,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to be an extra time.</v>

2592
01:46:35.500 --> 01:46:38.810
<v Speaker 1>I think what you said is very important,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's psychological needs that</v>

2593
01:46:38.811 --> 01:46:41.630
<v Speaker 1>are just as valuable and important as</v>
<v Speaker 1>physical needs.</v>

2594
01:46:41.631 --> 01:46:43.340
<v Speaker 1>Like we know we have needs for</v>
<v Speaker 1>nutrients,</v>

2595
01:46:43.341 --> 01:46:47.900
<v Speaker 1>we know have needs for water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have needs psychological for all</v>

2596
01:46:47.901 --> 01:46:50.160
<v Speaker 1>sorts of different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our communities</v>

2597
01:46:50.160 --> 01:46:53.130
<v Speaker 3>are incredibly important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Love is incredibly important.</v>

2598
01:46:53.131 --> 01:46:55.740
<v Speaker 3>Family's incredibly important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2599
01:46:55.741 --> 01:46:59.110
<v Speaker 3>I know some people that are older men</v>
<v Speaker 3>that uh,</v>

2600
01:46:59.130 --> 01:47:03.570
<v Speaker 3>have been bachelors their whole lives</v>
<v Speaker 3>and their child lists and now they're,</v>

2601
01:47:03.840 --> 01:47:04.890
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just,</v>

2602
01:47:05.010 --> 01:47:09.300
<v Speaker 3>they don't have a deep connection with</v>
<v Speaker 3>anybody and they get to this very weird,</v>

2603
01:47:09.301 --> 01:47:11.340
<v Speaker 3>strange place where they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is this it?</v>

2604
01:47:11.410 --> 01:47:16.290
<v Speaker 3>Now I'm 70 years old and I've never</v>
<v Speaker 3>really had children and I don't know</v>

2605
01:47:16.291 --> 01:47:19.650
<v Speaker 3>what to do and this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is my life now.</v>

2606
01:47:19.710 --> 01:47:20.600
<v Speaker 3>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

2607
01:47:20.880 --> 01:47:23.940
<v Speaker 3>they've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all their friends have had families now</v>

2608
01:47:23.941 --> 01:47:26.370
<v Speaker 3>and their families,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of times the kids are grown up and</v>

2609
01:47:26.850 --> 01:47:28.470
<v Speaker 3>it becomes very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very strange.</v>

2610
01:47:28.770 --> 01:47:29.830
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought about that a lot.</v>

2611
01:47:30.040 --> 01:47:33.670
<v Speaker 2>Intubate this guy and professor John</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kasey Opo at the University of Chicago</v>

2612
01:47:33.671 --> 01:47:35.620
<v Speaker 2>who is the leading expert in the world</v>
<v Speaker 2>on loneliness.</v>

2613
01:47:36.190 --> 01:47:38.380
<v Speaker 2>And he said this thing to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's a bit like what the woman in</v>

2614
01:47:38.381 --> 01:47:40.960
<v Speaker 2>Geneva suddenly way to live your life</v>
<v Speaker 2>studying.</v>

2615
01:47:41.970 --> 01:47:42.803
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2616
01:47:45.140 --> 01:47:47.890
<v Speaker 2>they had this really interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a very simple point,</v>

2617
01:47:48.220 --> 01:47:49.720
<v Speaker 2>but it just said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you think about the circumstances</v>

2618
01:47:49.721 --> 01:47:50.800
<v Speaker 2>where we evolved,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2619
01:47:51.250 --> 01:47:53.470
<v Speaker 2>If you got separated from the tribe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you were alone,</v>

2620
01:47:53.860 --> 01:47:55.780
<v Speaker 2>you were depressed and anxious for</v>
<v Speaker 2>really fucking good reason.</v>

2621
01:47:55.781 --> 01:47:57.820
<v Speaker 2>You were about to be eaten.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You were in terrible danger.</v>

2622
01:47:57.821 --> 01:47:58.870
<v Speaker 2>If you got injured,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one would help.</v>

2623
01:47:58.890 --> 01:47:59.820
<v Speaker 2>You would die,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2624
01:48:00.220 --> 01:48:01.970
<v Speaker 2>So all the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he showed that,</v>

2625
01:48:02.590 --> 01:48:03.490
<v Speaker 2>as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we're,</v>

2626
01:48:03.580 --> 01:48:06.430
<v Speaker 2>when we're stressed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we release a hormone called Cortisol.</v>

2627
01:48:06.880 --> 01:48:10.480
<v Speaker 2>He showed this wrench to experiment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They wrote about in the book being</v>

2628
01:48:10.481 --> 01:48:13.930
<v Speaker 2>acutely lonely is a stressful as being</v>
<v Speaker 2>punched in the face by a stranger when</v>

2629
01:48:13.931 --> 01:48:15.460
<v Speaker 2>it comes to cortisol release,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2630
01:48:15.760 --> 01:48:19.390
<v Speaker 2>That's how deeply we are resistant to</v>
<v Speaker 2>loneliness,</v>

2631
01:48:19.430 --> 01:48:21.520
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a signal telling you to get back to</v>

2632
01:48:21.521 --> 01:48:22.680
<v Speaker 2>the tribe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why we bought,</v>

2633
01:48:22.700 --> 01:48:25.750
<v Speaker 2>it's a really important signal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If humans hadn't had that signal,</v>

2634
01:48:25.751 --> 01:48:26.950
<v Speaker 2>we wouldn't be here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2635
01:48:27.400 --> 01:48:28.720
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think you're right.</v>

2636
01:48:28.721 --> 01:48:30.130
<v Speaker 2>So when you look at these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these men,</v>

2637
01:48:30.880 --> 01:48:34.500
<v Speaker 2>if you have an isolated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was this woman,</v>

2638
01:48:34.690 --> 01:48:38.350
<v Speaker 2>so I covered this incredible protest</v>
<v Speaker 2>movement happened in Berlin on a big</v>

2639
01:48:38.351 --> 01:48:42.130
<v Speaker 2>anonymous housing project when no one</v>
<v Speaker 2>knew each other and they came together</v>

2640
01:48:42.131 --> 01:48:44.200
<v Speaker 2>to protest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a woman who was about to kill</v>

2641
01:48:44.201 --> 01:48:45.700
<v Speaker 2>herself because she was about to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>evicted.</v>

2642
01:48:46.240 --> 01:48:49.330
<v Speaker 2>And the whole housing project came</v>
<v Speaker 2>together to say she should be allowed to</v>

2643
01:48:49.331 --> 01:48:51.670
<v Speaker 2>stay in our home and they should have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>rent freeze.</v>

2644
01:48:52.180 --> 01:48:54.280
<v Speaker 2>And it's an amazing story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell it in the book,</v>

2645
01:48:54.281 --> 01:48:57.190
<v Speaker 2>but there's something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the women said to me that I never</v>

2646
01:48:57.191 --> 01:48:59.080
<v Speaker 2>forgot it was called narrow man.</v>

2647
01:48:59.500 --> 01:49:01.840
<v Speaker 2>She grown up in Turkey and she come to</v>
<v Speaker 2>Germany,</v>

2648
01:49:01.841 --> 01:49:04.810
<v Speaker 2>I think when she was 17 she said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I grew up in Turkey,</v>

2649
01:49:05.560 --> 01:49:08.200
<v Speaker 2>well I called my home was my village and</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone in it.</v>

2650
01:49:08.770 --> 01:49:11.560
<v Speaker 2>And then I came to live in the Western</v>
<v Speaker 2>world and I learned that what you're</v>

2651
01:49:11.561 --> 01:49:14.800
<v Speaker 2>meant to call home is just your four</v>
<v Speaker 2>walls and if you're lucky,</v>

2652
01:49:14.801 --> 01:49:19.630
<v Speaker 2>your family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then this protest began and we all</v>

2653
01:49:19.631 --> 01:49:23.320
<v Speaker 2>got to know each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this whole place became my home and</v>

2654
01:49:23.321 --> 01:49:26.010
<v Speaker 2>I think everywhere here is home now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2655
01:49:26.270 --> 01:49:27.460
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and she realized that,</v>

2656
01:49:28.090 --> 01:49:30.580
<v Speaker 2>that we are homeless in some sense in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the western world.</v>

2657
01:49:30.830 --> 01:49:33.550
<v Speaker 2>The US humans have a need for a sense of</v>
<v Speaker 2>belonging.</v>

2658
01:49:34.270 --> 01:49:37.900
<v Speaker 2>And our sense of home is too small to</v>
<v Speaker 2>meet our sense of belonging.</v>

2659
01:49:38.090 --> 01:49:41.020
<v Speaker 2>There's a wonderful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a Bosnian writer called Alexander Heyman</v>

2660
01:49:41.260 --> 01:49:42.530
<v Speaker 2>who said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2661
01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.100
<v Speaker 2>home is where people notice when you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>not there.</v>

2662
01:49:45.670 --> 01:49:48.540
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of like these guys you're</v>

2663
01:49:48.550 --> 01:49:50.230
<v Speaker 2>talking about is all the guys who</v>
<v Speaker 2>notices if they're not,</v>

2664
01:49:50.310 --> 01:49:53.170
<v Speaker 2>they're probably no one probably are in</v>
<v Speaker 2>a sense homeless,</v>

2665
01:49:53.320 --> 01:49:55.270
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll spiritually homeless.</v>

2666
01:49:55.720 --> 01:49:56.610
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

2667
01:49:56.611 --> 01:49:58.000
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a religious person.</v>

2668
01:49:58.001 --> 01:49:59.030
<v Speaker 2>I don't mean that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2669
01:49:59.070 --> 01:50:01.390
<v Speaker 2>He'd go through saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

2670
01:50:01.960 --> 01:50:05.620
<v Speaker 2>And so I think it's about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this comes back to think about how</v>

2671
01:50:05.621 --> 01:50:08.200
<v Speaker 2>different that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what everything we're talking about,</v>

2672
01:50:08.201 --> 01:50:11.170
<v Speaker 2>they can have different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our conversation has been to what my</v>

2673
01:50:11.171 --> 01:50:15.550
<v Speaker 2>doctor told me when I was a teenager.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I go in and I say I'm in real pain</v>

2674
01:50:15.551 --> 01:50:17.080
<v Speaker 2>and I feel like pain is leaking out at</v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

2675
01:50:17.081 --> 01:50:18.880
<v Speaker 2>And I can't control it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he says,</v>

2676
01:50:19.060 --> 01:50:20.590
<v Speaker 2>you've just got a malfunction in your</v>
<v Speaker 2>brain.</v>

2677
01:50:20.710 --> 01:50:22.840
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are the worst things about that?</v>

2678
01:50:22.841 --> 01:50:23.860
<v Speaker 2>There are many things wrong with that.</v>

2679
01:50:23.860 --> 01:50:25.420
<v Speaker 2>Firstly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what he said to me is not true.</v>

2680
01:50:25.960 --> 01:50:27.010
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2681
01:50:27.011 --> 01:50:29.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure he believed it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he was misinformed that I think</v>

2682
01:50:29.160 --> 01:50:31.910
<v Speaker 2>he was deliberately lying to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what he said was not true.</v>

2683
01:50:31.911 --> 01:50:34.450
<v Speaker 2>But also to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the biggest problem with just telling</v>

2684
01:50:34.451 --> 01:50:37.600
<v Speaker 2>this exclusively biological story about</v>
<v Speaker 2>depression and anxiety.</v>

2685
01:50:37.601 --> 01:50:39.460
<v Speaker 2>There's some real biological factors of</v>
<v Speaker 2>course,</v>

2686
01:50:40.060 --> 01:50:42.430
<v Speaker 2>is it cuts us off from having this</v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation,</v>

2687
01:50:42.431 --> 01:50:44.230
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>All those people you were talking about</v>

2688
01:50:44.231 --> 01:50:47.920
<v Speaker 2>who I was so insistent as I was to that</v>
<v Speaker 2>depression is just the result of a</v>

2689
01:50:47.921 --> 01:50:51.670
<v Speaker 2>chemical imbalance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you think that it disconnects you</v>

2690
01:50:51.671 --> 01:50:54.910
<v Speaker 2>from the source of your pain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it tells you your just biologically</v>

2691
01:50:54.911 --> 01:50:58.630
<v Speaker 2>broken and presumably always going to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>biologically broken when the</v>

2692
01:50:58.631 --> 01:51:01.240
<v Speaker 2>conversation we're having,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a different conversation.</v>

2693
01:51:01.241 --> 01:51:03.760
<v Speaker 2>It's a difficult conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a nuanced conversation.</v>

2694
01:51:03.970 --> 01:51:06.850
<v Speaker 2>It's not simplistic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not one problem,</v>

2695
01:51:06.910 --> 01:51:08.140
<v Speaker 2>one lever to solve it.</v>

2696
01:51:08.140 --> 01:51:10.780
<v Speaker 2>It's a much deeper and more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2697
01:51:10.960 --> 01:51:14.530
<v Speaker 2>textured way of thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is the conversation we have to</v>

2698
01:51:14.531 --> 01:51:15.880
<v Speaker 2>have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what the best scientists in the</v>

2699
01:51:15.881 --> 01:51:18.220
<v Speaker 2>world are telling us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The World Health Organization and my</v>

2700
01:51:18.221 --> 01:51:19.950
<v Speaker 2>worry is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2701
01:51:20.170 --> 01:51:21.580
<v Speaker 2>we're just being pushed in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you said,</v>

2702
01:51:21.581 --> 01:51:21.920
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2703
01:51:21.920 --> 01:51:25.090
<v Speaker 2>that broken metaphor about driving 37</v>
<v Speaker 2>miles in the wrong direction.</v>

2704
01:51:25.091 --> 01:51:26.860
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're just driving in the wrong</v>

2705
01:51:26.861 --> 01:51:28.660
<v Speaker 2>direction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're driving away from the source of</v>

2706
01:51:28.661 --> 01:51:32.380
<v Speaker 2>our pain rather than towards it where it</v>
<v Speaker 2>can be understood and solved.</v>

2707
01:51:32.590 --> 01:51:33.910
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's always going to be some pain in</v>

2708
01:51:33.911 --> 01:51:36.550
<v Speaker 2>human life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the fact that we have this one in</v>

2709
01:51:36.551 --> 01:51:38.770
<v Speaker 2>five people taking a psychiatric drug,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2710
01:51:39.420 --> 01:51:44.420
<v Speaker 2>I think the figure is one in 10 13 year</v>
<v Speaker 2>old boys is taking a stimulant drug to</v>

2711
01:51:44.531 --> 01:51:48.070
<v Speaker 2>make them focus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the figure is 30% of old people</v>

2712
01:51:48.071 --> 01:51:49.930
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in retirement homes have been given</v>

2713
01:51:49.931 --> 01:51:52.990
<v Speaker 2>antipsychotic drugs to shut them the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck up because they're rebelling</v>

2714
01:51:52.991 --> 01:51:54.190
<v Speaker 2>against the way they're being treated.</v>

2715
01:51:54.490 --> 01:51:57.730
<v Speaker 2>In between one in four middle aged women</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the United States is taking a</v>

2716
01:51:57.731 --> 01:52:00.280
<v Speaker 2>chemical anti depressant at any given</v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

2717
01:52:00.620 --> 01:52:02.110
<v Speaker 2>One in four,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one in four.</v>

2718
01:52:02.590 --> 01:52:04.840
<v Speaker 2>You're talking about that a society</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2719
01:52:04.930 --> 01:52:07.390
<v Speaker 2>I mean the figures about how many</v>
<v Speaker 2>children is much lower,</v>

2720
01:52:07.391 --> 01:52:11.140
<v Speaker 2>but it's so much more extreme.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The F number at number toddlers who have</v>

2721
01:52:11.141 --> 01:52:14.920
<v Speaker 2>been given antipsychotics in the United</v>
<v Speaker 2>States is just off the scale.</v>

2722
01:52:14.921 --> 01:52:15.860
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2723
01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:18.040
<v Speaker 2>I think doctor Sammie to Mimi has</v>
<v Speaker 2>written about this,</v>

2724
01:52:18.220 --> 01:52:20.470
<v Speaker 2>there's some extraordinary figure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not getting figure slightly wrong,</v>

2725
01:52:20.471 --> 01:52:24.730
<v Speaker 2>but it's something like a majority of</v>
<v Speaker 2>children in foster care in the United</v>

2726
01:52:24.730 --> 01:52:28.210
<v Speaker 2>States are being given stimulant drugs</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically to shut them up.</v>

2727
01:52:28.300 --> 01:52:29.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

2728
01:52:29.200 --> 01:52:33.340
<v Speaker 2>that's a disturbing one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The ritalin and rarely various</v>

2729
01:52:33.341 --> 01:52:35.860
<v Speaker 2>stimulants that they give to children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2730
01:52:36.280 --> 01:52:38.500
<v Speaker 2>what's that about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the cause of that?</v>

2731
01:52:38.920 --> 01:52:41.110
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's related to research as much</v>

2732
01:52:41.111 --> 01:52:42.410
<v Speaker 2>less than the other things we've talked</v>
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

2733
01:52:43.040 --> 01:52:45.250
<v Speaker 2>But from it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it came up a lot in the conversations</v>

2734
01:52:45.260 --> 01:52:48.110
<v Speaker 2>that I had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are many things going on here.</v>

2735
01:52:48.710 --> 01:52:50.480
<v Speaker 2>One of them is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2736
01:52:51.080 --> 01:52:53.210
<v Speaker 2>a lot of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so a lot of the,</v>

2737
01:52:53.330 --> 01:52:55.970
<v Speaker 2>not all of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of the causes of depression and</v>

2738
01:52:55.971 --> 01:52:58.790
<v Speaker 2>anxiety that I wrote about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't help but notice reading all</v>

2739
01:52:58.791 --> 01:53:02.540
<v Speaker 2>the research into being the scientists</v>
<v Speaker 2>also can lead to,</v>

2740
01:53:02.790 --> 01:53:05.240
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>decrease in focus and attention.</v>

2741
01:53:05.450 --> 01:53:08.780
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you are dead end at work and you,</v>

2742
01:53:08.810 --> 01:53:11.150
<v Speaker 2>you feel controlled all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to deaden yourself to get</v>

2743
01:53:11.151 --> 01:53:13.940
<v Speaker 2>through it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's harder attention's a muscle,</v>

2744
01:53:13.941 --> 01:53:16.310
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's harder to bring your brain back to</v>

2745
01:53:16.311 --> 01:53:18.290
<v Speaker 2>focus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like Joe wanted to just go and collapse</v>

2746
01:53:18.291 --> 01:53:19.280
<v Speaker 2>and watch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2747
01:53:19.340 --> 01:53:21.530
<v Speaker 2>watch whatever shit was on the bachelor</v>
<v Speaker 2>or whatever.</v>

2748
01:53:21.880 --> 01:53:24.200
<v Speaker 2>I would watch the bachelor actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever shit would have been on the</v>

2749
01:53:24.220 --> 01:53:26.310
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] on the TV.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2750
01:53:26.330 --> 01:53:28.730
<v Speaker 2>so one is full state of depression in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bathroom.</v>

2751
01:53:30.890 --> 01:53:34.310
<v Speaker 2>He was prepared to take oxy but not to</v>
<v Speaker 2>go to that level of self harm.</v>

2752
01:53:34.311 --> 01:53:35.144
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the,</v>

2753
01:53:35.450 --> 01:53:37.340
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or think about loneliness,</v>

2754
01:53:37.341 --> 01:53:39.380
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's really pressed casio potion.</v>

2755
01:53:39.490 --> 01:53:41.210
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you are lonely,</v>

2756
01:53:41.690 --> 01:53:43.490
<v Speaker 2>that triggers what's called hyper</v>
<v Speaker 2>vigilance,</v>

2757
01:53:43.491 --> 01:53:44.301
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

2758
01:53:44.301 --> 01:53:46.610
<v Speaker 2>for very good reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're on your own in the savannas of</v>

2759
01:53:46.611 --> 01:53:47.760
<v Speaker 2>Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2760
01:53:47.810 --> 01:53:49.130
<v Speaker 2>You want to be hypervigilant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>

2761
01:53:49.160 --> 01:53:50.780
<v Speaker 2>So you find it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things it was most</v>

2762
01:53:50.781 --> 01:53:55.781
<v Speaker 2>challenging to me is this evidence that</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people with the lowest levels of</v>

2763
01:53:56.091 --> 01:53:59.720
<v Speaker 2>attention problems and depression and</v>
<v Speaker 2>anxiety in the United States or the</v>

2764
01:53:59.721 --> 01:54:00.680
<v Speaker 2>amish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2765
01:54:00.920 --> 01:54:04.220
<v Speaker 2>And I am a atheist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gay liberal.</v>

2766
01:54:04.310 --> 01:54:06.770
<v Speaker 2>So the idea of going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like learning something from the</v>

2767
01:54:06.771 --> 01:54:08.690
<v Speaker 2>Amish was initially challenging to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I've got a mare,</v>

2768
01:54:09.320 --> 01:54:11.280
<v Speaker 2>I felt really humbled by going and</v>
<v Speaker 2>spending time with,</v>

2769
01:54:11.290 --> 01:54:12.900
<v Speaker 2>I went to this village called</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible],</v>

2770
01:54:13.190 --> 01:54:15.680
<v Speaker 2>which is just outside of Fort Wayne,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Indiana.</v>

2771
01:54:16.460 --> 01:54:19.310
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's still a lot I disagree with</v>

2772
01:54:19.311 --> 01:54:20.540
<v Speaker 2>about the Amish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't get me wrong,</v>

2773
01:54:20.780 --> 01:54:22.220
<v Speaker 2>not least cause I just rewatched</v>
<v Speaker 2>witness,</v>

2774
01:54:22.250 --> 01:54:23.083
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2775
01:54:23.100 --> 01:54:24.810
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

2776
01:54:25.070 --> 01:54:26.790
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2777
01:54:26.840 --> 01:54:29.020
<v Speaker 2>I could see that they've got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's very interesting about the army.</v>

2778
01:54:29.021 --> 01:54:29.854
<v Speaker 2>She's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2779
01:54:30.110 --> 01:54:32.060
<v Speaker 2>when you turn 16,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're an amish,</v>

2780
01:54:32.120 --> 01:54:35.030
<v Speaker 2>you've got to leave and go and live in</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they call the English world,</v>

2781
01:54:35.031 --> 01:54:35.864
<v Speaker 2>our world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2782
01:54:36.170 --> 01:54:38.930
<v Speaker 2>And then you decide whether it's come</v>
<v Speaker 2>back about 80% decide to come back.</v>

2783
01:54:38.931 --> 01:54:41.200
<v Speaker 2>20% don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the reasons why the amish is</v>

2784
01:54:41.210 --> 01:54:44.180
<v Speaker 2>never counted as a cult because no cult</v>
<v Speaker 2>would do that right now.</v>

2785
01:54:44.181 --> 01:54:46.250
<v Speaker 2>Call.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to tell you to leave for two</v>

2786
01:54:46.251 --> 01:54:48.110
<v Speaker 2>years and then decide whether to come</v>
<v Speaker 2>back to the fact that the exact</v>

2787
01:54:48.111 --> 01:54:50.450
<v Speaker 2>opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they have lived in our world,</v>

2788
01:54:50.451 --> 01:54:51.980
<v Speaker 2>they know our world really well.</v>

2789
01:54:52.160 --> 01:54:53.990
<v Speaker 2>And even having this very challenging</v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation with,</v>

2790
01:54:54.020 --> 01:54:55.340
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's his name?</v>

2791
01:54:55.341 --> 01:54:58.520
<v Speaker 2>Lauren beachy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His name is an amish guy there who said</v>

2792
01:54:58.820 --> 01:55:00.680
<v Speaker 2>there cyber,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because back to the weight conversation</v>

2793
01:55:00.681 --> 01:55:01.970
<v Speaker 2>we had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>

2794
01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:03.770
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's loads of things I miss.</v>

2795
01:55:03.771 --> 01:55:05.510
<v Speaker 2>He talked about missing that seventies</v>
<v Speaker 2>show.</v>

2796
01:55:05.780 --> 01:55:08.150
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to love driving in trucks because</v>

2797
01:55:08.151 --> 01:55:10.460
<v Speaker 2>they obviously don't drive that ultra</v>
<v Speaker 2>steer off the grid.</v>

2798
01:55:11.300 --> 01:55:12.350
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

2799
01:55:12.351 --> 01:55:15.530
<v Speaker 2>if I kept those things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't spend time with my family.</v>

2800
01:55:15.650 --> 01:55:17.060
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't spend time with my children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't,</v>

2801
01:55:17.230 --> 01:55:20.160
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't know who my neighbors were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we said the spreadsheet,</v>

2802
01:55:20.161 --> 01:55:21.020
<v Speaker 2>angelic thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>

2803
01:55:21.380 --> 01:55:22.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>weight watchers.</v>

2804
01:55:22.401 --> 01:55:23.090
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2805
01:55:23.090 --> 01:55:23.923
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2806
01:55:23.930 --> 01:55:26.600
<v Speaker 2>the idea of weight watchers is you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>only lose weight together as a group,</v>

2807
01:55:26.601 --> 01:55:27.770
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It helps or not only,</v>

2808
01:55:27.771 --> 01:55:30.710
<v Speaker 2>but it helps you to lose weight together</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a group that you would find it harder</v>

2809
01:55:30.711 --> 01:55:32.810
<v Speaker 2>on your own.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is like that.</v>

2810
01:55:32.811 --> 01:55:34.550
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you saying about the amish is</v>

2811
01:55:34.551 --> 01:55:37.310
<v Speaker 2>like weight watchers for the problems of</v>
<v Speaker 2>Western civilization?</v>

2812
01:55:37.580 --> 01:55:38.413
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2813
01:55:38.570 --> 01:55:41.030
<v Speaker 2>that's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And to me that was so challenging.</v>

2814
01:55:41.031 --> 01:55:43.820
<v Speaker 2>The idea that you've got to give,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because we comes back to what is there a</v>

2815
01:55:43.900 --> 01:55:47.010
<v Speaker 2>junk news in our culture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we told the solution is always to get</v>

2816
01:55:47.011 --> 01:55:49.410
<v Speaker 2>more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the idea that the solution is to</v>

2817
01:55:49.411 --> 01:55:53.250
<v Speaker 2>have less and be present more is really</v>
<v Speaker 2>challenging.</v>

2818
01:55:53.251 --> 01:55:53.890
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2819
01:55:53.890 --> 01:55:55.510
<v Speaker 3>I don't even think it's about having</v>
<v Speaker 3>less,</v>

2820
01:55:55.511 --> 01:55:57.790
<v Speaker 3>it's about what they're doing is look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eat,</v>

2821
01:55:57.791 --> 01:56:00.370
<v Speaker 3>think about what the amish are doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>

2822
01:56:00.520 --> 01:56:02.170
<v Speaker 3>massive sense of community,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2823
01:56:02.350 --> 01:56:04.780
<v Speaker 3>They're very connected.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not using cell phones and not</v>

2824
01:56:04.781 --> 01:56:07.690
<v Speaker 3>using email.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the community is also based on one to</v>

2825
01:56:07.691 --> 01:56:10.120
<v Speaker 3>one interaction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>real social cues,</v>

2826
01:56:10.121 --> 01:56:12.100
<v Speaker 3>real social interaction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is critical.</v>

2827
01:56:12.310 --> 01:56:15.550
<v Speaker 3>It's a big part of being a human being</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's one of the more apps and things</v>

2828
01:56:15.551 --> 01:56:20.200
<v Speaker 3>in modern society to physical labor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're involved in a lot of physical</v>

2829
01:56:20.201 --> 01:56:22.090
<v Speaker 3>labor because they don't use</v>
<v Speaker 3>electricity,</v>

2830
01:56:22.091 --> 01:56:24.970
<v Speaker 3>they don't use power tools.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's so many things that they don't</v>

2831
01:56:24.971 --> 01:56:27.070
<v Speaker 3>do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so because of their culture,</v>

2832
01:56:27.071 --> 01:56:29.110
<v Speaker 3>they're making their own homes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>

2833
01:56:29.260 --> 01:56:32.110
<v Speaker 3>so they have a vested interest in</v>
<v Speaker 3>helping each other,</v>

2834
01:56:32.111 --> 01:56:35.590
<v Speaker 3>working together as a community and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>have a deep sense of satisfaction of</v>

2835
01:56:35.920 --> 01:56:38.170
<v Speaker 3>constructing each other's homes.</v>

2836
01:56:38.350 --> 01:56:41.860
<v Speaker 3>You construct my home with me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I help you build your home.</v>

2837
01:56:42.040 --> 01:56:45.100
<v Speaker 3>They take care of their animals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they take care of their crops,</v>

2838
01:56:45.101 --> 01:56:48.310
<v Speaker 3>they take theirs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a real connection with where</v>

2839
01:56:48.311 --> 01:56:52.220
<v Speaker 3>they get their food from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A real connection with where they live,</v>

2840
01:56:52.221 --> 01:56:55.470
<v Speaker 3>their community,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sense of just the whole,</v>

2841
01:56:55.480 --> 01:56:58.540
<v Speaker 3>the sense of belonging to something</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's bigger than you.</v>

2842
01:56:58.840 --> 01:57:01.660
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's so many factors involved in</v>

2843
01:57:01.661 --> 01:57:04.780
<v Speaker 3>their happiness that you can kind of see</v>
<v Speaker 3>where it,</v>

2844
01:57:04.781 --> 01:57:06.800
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of wacky shit with the,</v>

2845
01:57:06.810 --> 01:57:09.970
<v Speaker 3>the cult aspects of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of being an amish person.</v>

2846
01:57:09.971 --> 01:57:14.230
<v Speaker 3>But what you get out of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's almost like if you had a self help</v>

2847
01:57:14.231 --> 01:57:18.700
<v Speaker 3>group that subscribed to all the</v>
<v Speaker 3>positive benefits of being amish and</v>

2848
01:57:18.701 --> 01:57:21.880
<v Speaker 3>they just called it like regrounding or</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

2849
01:57:21.881 --> 01:57:25.570
<v Speaker 3>And you just go out there and you become</v>
<v Speaker 3>a part of nature and make mean that's,</v>

2850
01:57:25.571 --> 01:57:28.630
<v Speaker 3>that seems like a co op.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it seems like some sort of a farm</v>

2851
01:57:28.631 --> 01:57:29.850
<v Speaker 3>based CO-OP,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2852
01:57:30.020 --> 01:57:32.770
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bill each other's houses stay together.</v>

2853
01:57:32.860 --> 01:57:35.740
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to wear sexy clothes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's just all wear the same shit.</v>

2854
01:57:35.760 --> 01:57:36.593
<v Speaker 3>It's no big deal.</v>

2855
01:57:36.690 --> 01:57:38.010
<v Speaker 2>I love how you put that in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're right.</v>

2856
01:57:38.280 --> 01:57:40.620
<v Speaker 2>So the inequality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the richest Dharmesh is as wealthy as</v>

2857
01:57:40.621 --> 01:57:42.840
<v Speaker 2>the forest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's essentially as well,</v>

2858
01:57:42.841 --> 01:57:45.570
<v Speaker 2>cause it's not like they're not holding</v>
<v Speaker 2>them back.</v>

2859
01:57:45.960 --> 01:57:49.500
<v Speaker 2>I think that's one of the things that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>think about this in relation to</v>

2860
01:57:49.501 --> 01:57:53.580
<v Speaker 2>attention is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there's this theory that amish kids</v>

2861
01:57:53.581 --> 01:57:55.290
<v Speaker 2>don't seem to develop Adhd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2862
01:57:55.291 --> 01:57:57.720
<v Speaker 2>And there's been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's been surprisingly understudied</v>

2863
01:57:58.080 --> 01:58:00.900
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] doctors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's the problem for kids are</v>

2864
01:58:00.901 --> 01:58:04.400
<v Speaker 2>bouncing off the wall and he's adorable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's that.</v>

2865
01:58:04.401 --> 01:58:05.940
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wondered if it was that and I would</v>

2866
01:58:05.941 --> 01:58:08.370
<v Speaker 2>say about it if it was like they don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>have electronics and then obviously I'm</v>

2867
01:58:08.371 --> 01:58:09.630
<v Speaker 2>kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there's an element going</v>

2868
01:58:09.631 --> 01:58:12.720
<v Speaker 2>on there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But actually the main thing is when I</v>

2869
01:58:12.721 --> 01:58:15.000
<v Speaker 2>spoke to them they said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2870
01:58:15.001 --> 01:58:17.370
<v Speaker 2>we've got some kids who don't want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>concentrate and sit in school,</v>

2871
01:58:17.371 --> 01:58:19.610
<v Speaker 2>but so we just let them run around and</v>
<v Speaker 2>go fishing and hunting and state.</v>

2872
01:58:19.620 --> 01:58:20.890
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so many brands,</v>

2873
01:58:20.950 --> 01:58:22.860
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's always going to be,</v>

2874
01:58:23.020 --> 01:58:25.410
<v Speaker 2>there may be factors making it harder</v>
<v Speaker 2>for us to concentrate in the</v>

2875
01:58:25.411 --> 01:58:26.370
<v Speaker 2>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there are,</v>

2876
01:58:26.730 --> 01:58:29.250
<v Speaker 2>but there's always going to be a natural</v>
<v Speaker 2>variation in people who want to sit and</v>

2877
01:58:29.251 --> 01:58:31.020
<v Speaker 2>focus on one thing compared to people</v>
<v Speaker 2>who want to,</v>

2878
01:58:31.350 --> 01:58:33.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>run around medically.</v>

2879
01:58:33.001 --> 01:58:35.640
<v Speaker 2>And that's actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can see how as a species it benefits</v>

2880
01:58:35.641 --> 01:58:36.660
<v Speaker 2>us to have both,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2881
01:58:37.740 --> 01:58:42.740
<v Speaker 2>But what we do is we try to bash every</v>
<v Speaker 2>child into one particular mode of being,</v>

2882
01:58:43.990 --> 01:58:46.690
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually is designed to prepare them for</v>

2883
01:58:46.691 --> 01:58:48.730
<v Speaker 2>Shitty deadening work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The reason our schools are shitty and</v>

2884
01:58:48.731 --> 01:58:50.780
<v Speaker 2>deadening does a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a guy called Alfie cone,</v>

2885
01:58:50.781 --> 01:58:54.220
<v Speaker 2>he says every school has an official</v>
<v Speaker 2>curriculum and a hidden curriculum.</v>

2886
01:58:54.610 --> 01:58:56.710
<v Speaker 2>The official curriculum is like history,</v>
<v Speaker 2>geography,</v>

2887
01:58:56.711 --> 01:58:59.050
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the hidden curriculum is,</v>

2888
01:58:59.200 --> 01:59:01.900
<v Speaker 2>this is what we're training you to put</v>
<v Speaker 2>up with in your life,</v>

2889
01:59:01.960 --> 01:59:02.793
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2890
01:59:02.830 --> 01:59:07.180
<v Speaker 2>And if you've got a society where 87% of</v>
<v Speaker 2>people don't like their work and you're</v>

2891
01:59:07.181 --> 01:59:09.550
<v Speaker 2>more twice as likely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost twice as likely to hate your job</v>

2892
01:59:09.551 --> 01:59:10.384
<v Speaker 2>as love,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your job,</v>

2893
01:59:10.630 --> 01:59:13.990
<v Speaker 2>part of the job of the school system</v>
<v Speaker 2>will be to deaden children.</v>

2894
01:59:14.200 --> 01:59:16.630
<v Speaker 2>So they learn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got to fucking sit there and shut</v>

2895
01:59:16.631 --> 01:59:18.490
<v Speaker 2>up and do what you're told,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2896
01:59:18.670 --> 01:59:20.410
<v Speaker 2>So that's not a malfunction of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>

2897
01:59:20.411 --> 01:59:22.240
<v Speaker 2>That's an unconscious functions of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>system,</v>

2898
01:59:22.241 --> 01:59:23.850
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we,</v>

2899
01:59:23.950 --> 01:59:25.390
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've got this system where we're</v>

2900
01:59:25.391 --> 01:59:28.510
<v Speaker 2>bashing these kids to prepare them for</v>
<v Speaker 2>this economic system that's making us</v>

2901
01:59:28.511 --> 01:59:30.100
<v Speaker 2>feel miserable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To me,</v>

2902
01:59:30.101 --> 01:59:32.800
<v Speaker 2>the solution is to change the way we</v>
<v Speaker 2>work so we don't have to fucking dead</v>

2903
01:59:32.801 --> 01:59:33.790
<v Speaker 2>and our children,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2904
01:59:33.950 --> 01:59:36.640
<v Speaker 2>So actually our children can be a bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the arm issue,</v>

2905
01:59:36.641 --> 01:59:37.210
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2906
01:59:37.210 --> 01:59:38.830
<v Speaker 2>do as you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not like they're doing</v>

2907
01:59:41.020 --> 01:59:43.720
<v Speaker 2>high end cognitive labor is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will be the fancy way of putting it,</v>

2908
01:59:43.721 --> 01:59:44.020
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2909
01:59:44.020 --> 01:59:44.860
<v Speaker 2>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2910
01:59:44.861 --> 01:59:47.980
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their kids to them having a kid who goes</v>

2911
01:59:47.981 --> 01:59:49.720
<v Speaker 2>fishing and running around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's normal.</v>

2912
01:59:49.750 --> 01:59:53.110
<v Speaker 2>It's as valuable actually as you may</v>
<v Speaker 2>even be more valuable than the kid who</v>

2913
01:59:53.111 --> 01:59:54.530
<v Speaker 2>sits there reading.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2914
01:59:54.850 --> 01:59:55.780
<v Speaker 2>Because actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

2915
01:59:56.140 --> 01:59:57.820
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a real thing about this,</v>

2916
01:59:57.821 --> 01:59:59.740
<v Speaker 2>what that tells us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it comes back to one of the themes</v>

2917
01:59:59.741 --> 02:00:01.000
<v Speaker 2>that's come up all through our</v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation,</v>

2918
02:00:01.001 --> 02:00:03.640
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these things that we're told our</v>

2919
02:00:03.641 --> 02:00:06.700
<v Speaker 2>pathologies make sense in their</v>
<v Speaker 2>contexts,</v>

2920
02:00:06.701 --> 02:00:07.930
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Depression,</v>

2921
02:00:07.931 --> 02:00:09.970
<v Speaker 2>we're told it's a pathology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually,</v>

2922
02:00:10.120 --> 02:00:12.760
<v Speaker 2>anxiety with tides project actually is</v>
<v Speaker 2>largely,</v>

2923
02:00:12.790 --> 02:00:15.430
<v Speaker 2>not entirely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but largely a response to things going</v>

2924
02:00:15.431 --> 02:00:17.500
<v Speaker 2>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're told addiction is a pathology.</v>

2925
02:00:17.501 --> 02:00:20.620
<v Speaker 2>It's a response to things happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're told that obesity is a pathology.</v>

2926
02:00:20.621 --> 02:00:22.510
<v Speaker 2>In some cases it's a response to things</v>
<v Speaker 2>going wrong.</v>

2927
02:00:22.690 --> 02:00:25.720
<v Speaker 2>We told the kids not wanting to be able</v>
<v Speaker 2>to focus as a pathology in adults not</v>

2928
02:00:25.721 --> 02:00:26.554
<v Speaker 2>being able to focus.</v>

2929
02:00:26.860 --> 02:00:29.380
<v Speaker 2>I think we need to understand that these</v>
<v Speaker 2>things have meaning.</v>

2930
02:00:29.560 --> 02:00:31.000
<v Speaker 2>They make sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2931
02:00:31.030 --> 02:00:33.940
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean they're good most,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's clearly not good to be a basis,</v>

2932
02:00:33.970 --> 02:00:36.370
<v Speaker 2>clearly not good to be addicted</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously,</v>

2933
02:00:36.640 --> 02:00:38.410
<v Speaker 2>but if you understand that they make</v>
<v Speaker 2>sense.</v>

2934
02:00:38.411 --> 02:00:42.730
<v Speaker 2>That opens up a totally different way of</v>
<v Speaker 2>responding to them once that actually</v>

2935
02:00:42.731 --> 02:00:43.630
<v Speaker 2>fucking work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2936
02:00:43.750 --> 02:00:45.820
<v Speaker 2>The places that I think about the drug</v>
<v Speaker 2>war,</v>

2937
02:00:45.821 --> 02:00:49.810
<v Speaker 2>right for chasing the scream by book</v>
<v Speaker 2>about addiction and the drug war.</v>

2938
02:00:49.840 --> 02:00:54.070
<v Speaker 2>I went out with a group of women in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Arizona in that prison run by that</v>

2939
02:00:54.071 --> 02:00:57.010
<v Speaker 2>fucking psychopath Joe Arpaio,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who I also interviewed who trump</v>

2940
02:00:57.011 --> 02:00:59.830
<v Speaker 2>pardoned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How the fuck did he pardon that guy?</v>

2941
02:01:02.620 --> 02:01:05.330
<v Speaker 2>Don't get me started on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>About this deeply.</v>

2942
02:01:05.740 --> 02:01:06.491
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's funny,</v>

2943
02:01:06.491 --> 02:01:08.710
<v Speaker 2>I can tell you about Joe Arpaio cause a</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a funny sort of way.</v>

2944
02:01:08.711 --> 02:01:10.030
<v Speaker 2>I felt very sorry for him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>

2945
02:01:10.420 --> 02:01:15.220
<v Speaker 2>I went out on this group of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with this group of women who are made to</v>

2946
02:01:15.221 --> 02:01:18.700
<v Speaker 2>go out on a chain gang wearing tee</v>
<v Speaker 2>shirts saying I was a drug addict where</v>

2947
02:01:18.701 --> 02:01:20.800
<v Speaker 2>members of the public mock them and</v>
<v Speaker 2>jared them.</v>

2948
02:01:20.801 --> 02:01:22.450
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

2949
02:01:24.310 --> 02:01:27.670
<v Speaker 2>I remember going back to the prison with</v>
<v Speaker 2>them is called tent city.</v>

2950
02:01:28.540 --> 02:01:31.420
<v Speaker 2>And the women were terrified is</v>
<v Speaker 2>something called the hole,</v>

2951
02:01:31.421 --> 02:01:33.070
<v Speaker 2>which is where you were sent if you</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucked up.</v>

2952
02:01:33.071 --> 02:01:36.280
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I said to the gods,</v>

2953
02:01:36.310 --> 02:01:39.040
<v Speaker 2>we take me to see the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I've been in a lot reporting from</v>

2954
02:01:39.050 --> 02:01:40.160
<v Speaker 2>prisons and God's always</v>

2955
02:01:40.160 --> 02:01:43.340
<v Speaker 1>don't want to show you the bad things in</v>
<v Speaker 1>this one cause it's a fucking pantomime</v>

2956
02:01:43.341 --> 02:01:45.710
<v Speaker 1>of cruelty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want you to see it.</v>

2957
02:01:45.750 --> 02:01:47.180
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they took me to the hole.</v>

2958
02:01:47.181 --> 02:01:49.040
<v Speaker 1>It was in fact a whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a concrete cell,</v>

2959
02:01:49.041 --> 02:01:52.070
<v Speaker 1>bare concrete cell with nothing in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no TV,</v>

2960
02:01:52.071 --> 02:01:53.720
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2961
02:01:54.200 --> 02:01:56.080
<v Speaker 1>and I saw this woman in there who was</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2962
02:01:56.150 --> 02:02:00.320
<v Speaker 1>she saw my face through that was just so</v>
<v Speaker 1>desperate to be a human being who wasn't</v>

2963
02:02:00.321 --> 02:02:02.750
<v Speaker 1>one of these guards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She'd been there for a month.</v>

2964
02:02:02.810 --> 02:02:05.240
<v Speaker 1>And I remember the audio is actually on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the chasing the scream website.</v>

2965
02:02:05.241 --> 02:02:10.241
<v Speaker 1>I'm chasing the scream.com and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember looking in the cell and</v>

2966
02:02:10.641 --> 02:02:14.000
<v Speaker 1>thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the closest you could get to a</v>

2967
02:02:14.001 --> 02:02:18.800
<v Speaker 1>literal human reenactment of the cages</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guaranteed addiction in rats.</v>

2968
02:02:19.310 --> 02:02:21.680
<v Speaker 1>And this is what we're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking it will stop this woman from</v>

2969
02:02:21.681 --> 02:02:25.580
<v Speaker 1>being addicted all the places which had</v>
<v Speaker 1>approaches based on punishment and shame</v>

2970
02:02:25.581 --> 02:02:26.600
<v Speaker 1>towards these things.</v>

2971
02:02:26.870 --> 02:02:28.430
<v Speaker 1>It's sometimes people say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2972
02:02:28.431 --> 02:02:30.890
<v Speaker 1>punishing people with addiction problems</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't work.</v>

2973
02:02:31.460 --> 02:02:34.550
<v Speaker 1>That's way too soft on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes the problem worse,</v>

2974
02:02:34.610 --> 02:02:37.220
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those women go in fucking broken,</v>

2975
02:02:37.221 --> 02:02:39.650
<v Speaker 1>devastated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they're even more broken and</v>

2976
02:02:39.651 --> 02:02:41.510
<v Speaker 1>devastated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They go out even more fucking addicted.</v>

2977
02:02:41.511 --> 02:02:44.000
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So reason why Portugal has massively for</v>

2978
02:02:44.120 --> 02:02:47.120
<v Speaker 1>portrait in Switzerland have massively</v>
<v Speaker 1>falling addiction problems and the</v>

2979
02:02:47.121 --> 02:02:49.640
<v Speaker 1>United States have massively increasing</v>
<v Speaker 1>one's right.</v>

2980
02:02:50.120 --> 02:02:52.730
<v Speaker 1>So to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

2981
02:02:52.790 --> 02:02:57.740
<v Speaker 1>the evidence is approaches towards these</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem that are based on compassion</v>

2982
02:02:58.160 --> 02:02:59.740
<v Speaker 1>connection,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2983
02:02:59.840 --> 02:03:01.850
<v Speaker 1>love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding,</v>

2984
02:03:01.880 --> 02:03:04.880
<v Speaker 1>seeing that it makes sense work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not magic bullets.</v>

2985
02:03:04.881 --> 02:03:06.710
<v Speaker 1>There's still gonna be problems in</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything we do.</v>

2986
02:03:07.270 --> 02:03:12.270
<v Speaker 1>And approach is based on shame and</v>
<v Speaker 1>stigma and rage and just condemning</v>

2987
02:03:13.071 --> 02:03:14.660
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2988
02:03:15.410 --> 02:03:17.690
<v Speaker 1>they just make the problem worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2989
02:03:17.691 --> 02:03:20.540
<v Speaker 1>There's no doubt about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's also no doubt about what you</v>

2990
02:03:20.541 --> 02:03:23.720
<v Speaker 1>were speaking about when you started</v>
<v Speaker 1>that rant about schools.</v>

2991
02:03:24.120 --> 02:03:25.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>About schools where children trying to</v>

2992
02:03:25.971 --> 02:03:30.971
<v Speaker 1>fit them into these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these very convenient categories and</v>

2993
02:03:31.160 --> 02:03:34.070
<v Speaker 1>trying to get them to get comfortable</v>
<v Speaker 1>with doing things that they don't want</v>

2994
02:03:34.071 --> 02:03:36.500
<v Speaker 1>to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's great.</v>

2995
02:03:36.530 --> 02:03:39.320
<v Speaker 1>If we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've resigned ourselves to turning</v>

2996
02:03:39.321 --> 02:03:42.170
<v Speaker 1>children into work robots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love that way of putting it.</v>

2997
02:03:42.171 --> 02:03:43.070
<v Speaker 1>He just said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's brilliant.</v>

2998
02:03:43.071 --> 02:03:45.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It shouldn't really ramping it.</v>

2999
02:03:45.590 --> 02:03:47.090
<v Speaker 1>Oh look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went through that myself.</v>

3000
02:03:47.120 --> 02:03:49.370
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was a fool when I was in</v>
<v Speaker 1>high school.</v>

3001
02:03:49.371 --> 02:03:50.870
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's gotta be something wrong with</v>

3002
02:03:50.871 --> 02:03:51.860
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't concentrate.</v>

3003
02:03:51.861 --> 02:03:54.680
<v Speaker 1>I can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm never going to be good at anything.</v>

3004
02:03:54.740 --> 02:03:57.320
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to resign myself to be an</v>

3005
02:03:57.321 --> 02:03:59.660
<v Speaker 1>outcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to resign myself to be a loser</v>

3006
02:03:59.990 --> 02:04:02.450
<v Speaker 1>because I just couldn't sit still in</v>
<v Speaker 1>class.</v>

3007
02:04:02.451 --> 02:04:04.490
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't pay attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to do the homework.</v>

3008
02:04:04.670 --> 02:04:08.690
<v Speaker 1>I was bored out of my fucking mind and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't even realize there was anything</v>

3009
02:04:08.780 --> 02:04:12.830
<v Speaker 1>that I could do that I would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectually curious about.</v>

3010
02:04:13.130 --> 02:04:13.581
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

3011
02:04:13.581 --> 02:04:15.890
<v Speaker 1>I didn't think that that was a part of</v>
<v Speaker 1>my life.</v>

3012
02:04:15.891 --> 02:04:20.090
<v Speaker 1>I didn't think I was a curious person</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was just merely because I was</v>

3013
02:04:20.091 --> 02:04:23.270
<v Speaker 1>being forced to do a bunch of shit that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to do and it tainted my</v>

3014
02:04:23.271 --> 02:04:27.980
<v Speaker 1>idea of learning and when I got out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>school and then when I started reading</v>

3015
02:04:27.981 --> 02:04:30.200
<v Speaker 1>books just for my own amusement and an</v>
<v Speaker 1>interest,</v>

3016
02:04:30.201 --> 02:04:31.160
<v Speaker 1>then I realize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3017
02:04:31.220 --> 02:04:33.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm a very curious person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

3018
02:04:34.370 --> 02:04:36.740
<v Speaker 1>I just didn't want to do what they</v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted me to do.</v>

3019
02:04:36.741 --> 02:04:38.040
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to study what</v>

3020
02:04:38.040 --> 02:04:41.460
<v Speaker 3>they wanted me to study and I didn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>want to be stuck in some room with some</v>

3021
02:04:41.461 --> 02:04:45.780
<v Speaker 3>person who was under motivated and</v>
<v Speaker 3>really didn't have any understanding of</v>

3022
02:04:45.781 --> 02:04:48.180
<v Speaker 3>how to deal with children.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was the rare person,</v>

3023
02:04:48.181 --> 02:04:51.720
<v Speaker 3>one out of five when I was six teachers</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would come along that would give</v>

3024
02:04:51.721 --> 02:04:55.080
<v Speaker 3>you like some spark of happiness and</v>
<v Speaker 3>love and you'd go like,</v>

3025
02:04:55.130 --> 02:04:56.550
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this class is pretty cool.</v>

3026
02:04:56.670 --> 02:04:58.030
<v Speaker 3>That's a good teacher.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like Oh,</v>

3027
02:04:58.031 --> 02:04:59.240
<v Speaker 3>she's nice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3028
02:04:59.250 --> 02:05:00.990
<v Speaker 3>he's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was rare.</v>

3029
02:05:01.050 --> 02:05:04.440
<v Speaker 3>It was very rare.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most of the time it was a dull grind and</v>

3030
02:05:04.620 --> 02:05:09.090
<v Speaker 3>I would wake up with nightmares after</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd graduated that I'd fucked up and</v>

3031
02:05:09.091 --> 02:05:11.670
<v Speaker 3>didn't get the right amount of credits</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I had to go back to school.</v>

3032
02:05:12.060 --> 02:05:16.140
<v Speaker 3>I would have crazy nightmares that it</v>
<v Speaker 3>would have to repeat the 12th grade and</v>

3033
02:05:16.141 --> 02:05:19.230
<v Speaker 3>go back to school because I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was soul sucking.</v>

3034
02:05:19.500 --> 02:05:22.770
<v Speaker 3>And to me it represented the future</v>
<v Speaker 3>because the future was going to be more</v>

3035
02:05:22.771 --> 02:05:26.370
<v Speaker 3>soul sucking because you're going to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>working 40 hours a week plus overtime</v>

3036
02:05:26.430 --> 02:05:29.190
<v Speaker 3>doing something that you hated and this</v>
<v Speaker 3>is what you had to do if you wanted to</v>

3037
02:05:29.191 --> 02:05:32.880
<v Speaker 3>get by in this slide.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that is what was presented to me.</v>

3038
02:05:33.170 --> 02:05:34.920
<v Speaker 3>And that's what's presented to a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

3039
02:05:34.921 --> 02:05:37.620
<v Speaker 3>And if you take that and keep going with</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

3040
02:05:37.860 --> 02:05:40.530
<v Speaker 3>you eventually become that guy who was</v>
<v Speaker 3>in that job.</v>

3041
02:05:40.531 --> 02:05:41.311
<v Speaker 3>And then you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3042
02:05:41.311 --> 02:05:43.500
<v Speaker 3>maybe I'll get some happiness if I get a</v>
<v Speaker 3>nice car.</v>

3043
02:05:43.740 --> 02:05:47.820
<v Speaker 3>And so you take out a lease on a nice</v>
<v Speaker 3>car and then now you have this debt they</v>

3044
02:05:47.850 --> 02:05:49.960
<v Speaker 3>have to pay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So now you have to keep working and you</v>

3045
02:05:49.961 --> 02:05:51.450
<v Speaker 3>keep working.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you can keep this car.</v>

3046
02:05:51.451 --> 02:05:52.800
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to get a condo and then you</v>

3047
02:05:52.801 --> 02:05:54.000
<v Speaker 3>get a Condo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got more dead.</v>

3048
02:05:54.150 --> 02:05:55.800
<v Speaker 3>Then while I'm getting married,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're getting married.</v>

3049
02:05:55.801 --> 02:05:57.030
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've got to take out a loan for the</v>

3050
02:05:57.031 --> 02:05:59.540
<v Speaker 3>marriage because it's really expensive</v>
<v Speaker 3>to get married and all.</v>

3051
02:05:59.570 --> 02:06:02.010
<v Speaker 3>She wants a big wedding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you get a big wedding and a big</v>

3052
02:06:02.011 --> 02:06:04.290
<v Speaker 3>ring and all this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and now you're fucking deep deep in the</v>

3053
02:06:04.291 --> 02:06:06.570
<v Speaker 3>hall and now you have children.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Shit.</v>

3054
02:06:06.900 --> 02:06:08.070
<v Speaker 3>And then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

3055
02:06:08.100 --> 02:06:09.390
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really don't want to be selling</v>

3056
02:06:09.391 --> 02:06:10.870
<v Speaker 3>insurance anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wish I coulda,</v>

3057
02:06:10.880 --> 02:06:13.530
<v Speaker 3>I wish I could have been an artist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wish I could have done this.</v>

3058
02:06:13.531 --> 02:06:14.850
<v Speaker 3>I wish I could have pursued my</v>
<v Speaker 3>interests.</v>

3059
02:06:14.851 --> 02:06:16.590
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of too late.</v>

3060
02:06:16.740 --> 02:06:19.710
<v Speaker 3>You're 150 miles away from the neutral</v>
<v Speaker 3>point,</v>

3061
02:06:19.890 --> 02:06:23.370
<v Speaker 3>so you've got to go 150 miles back</v>
<v Speaker 3>before you could start at zero.</v>

3062
02:06:24.570 --> 02:06:26.660
<v Speaker 2>I think he put us so well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm just thinking about that the,</v>

3063
02:06:26.670 --> 02:06:30.210
<v Speaker 2>this is the heart of my bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lots of connections is saying we don't</v>

3064
02:06:30.270 --> 02:06:33.090
<v Speaker 2>have to have a human culture that</v>
<v Speaker 2>deadens people,</v>

3065
02:06:33.091 --> 02:06:33.660
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3066
02:06:33.660 --> 02:06:36.120
<v Speaker 2>We don't have to have a culture where</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are controlled,</v>

3067
02:06:36.290 --> 02:06:39.480
<v Speaker 2>dead end and isolated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not how most humans have ever</v>

3068
02:06:39.481 --> 02:06:40.830
<v Speaker 2>lived.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Amish live much,</v>

3069
02:06:41.610 --> 02:06:44.580
<v Speaker 2>far more human beings have lived in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>way the amish live that have ever lived</v>

3070
02:06:44.581 --> 02:06:45.510
<v Speaker 2>in the way we live.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

3071
02:06:45.511 --> 02:06:47.340
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to go fully back to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>amish obviously,</v>

3072
02:06:47.640 --> 02:06:49.560
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there are lessons we can learn from</v>

3073
02:06:49.620 --> 02:06:50.940
<v Speaker 2>all these things that we're talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

3074
02:06:50.941 --> 02:06:52.680
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about reconnection to meaning and</v>

3075
02:06:52.681 --> 02:06:54.240
<v Speaker 2>purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And part of what you're saying is we,</v>

3076
02:06:54.370 --> 02:06:57.390
<v Speaker 2>we live in a landscape that has been</v>
<v Speaker 2>constructed not to serve people,</v>

3077
02:06:57.391 --> 02:06:59.010
<v Speaker 2>but to serve corporations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3078
02:06:59.190 --> 02:07:03.330
<v Speaker 2>This very unusual recent human</v>
<v Speaker 2>innovation actually is.</v>

3079
02:07:03.330 --> 02:07:03.750
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3080
02:07:03.750 --> 02:07:06.810
<v Speaker 2>imagine if every corporation was</v>
<v Speaker 2>converted into democratic cooperatives.</v>

3081
02:07:06.811 --> 02:07:09.990
<v Speaker 2>Imagine everyone listening to this</v>
<v Speaker 2>tomorrow knew they were going into work</v>

3082
02:07:09.991 --> 02:07:12.930
<v Speaker 2>in a place where if there is a boss,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's elected by them,</v>

3083
02:07:13.170 --> 02:07:16.500
<v Speaker 2>he's accountable to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where you decide the priorities for your</v>

3084
02:07:16.501 --> 02:07:17.760
<v Speaker 2>workplace,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with your colleagues,</v>

3085
02:07:17.761 --> 02:07:19.920
<v Speaker 2>by voting maybe once every three months,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once a year,</v>

3086
02:07:19.921 --> 02:07:22.980
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the boss is accountable to you.</v>

3087
02:07:23.130 --> 02:07:26.670
<v Speaker 2>That's a very different way of living</v>
<v Speaker 2>and thinking about the things we do most</v>

3088
02:07:26.671 --> 02:07:29.250
<v Speaker 2>of the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that would again require a vote for</v>

3089
02:07:29.251 --> 02:07:33.650
<v Speaker 2>a school system that prepares people to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be citizens taking part in a workplace,</v>

3090
02:07:33.660 --> 02:07:36.670
<v Speaker 2>not are you put brilliantly like robot</v>
<v Speaker 2>workers,</v>

3091
02:07:36.850 --> 02:07:39.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just passively receiving orders that</v>

3092
02:07:39.461 --> 02:07:42.940
<v Speaker 2>requires a big systemic change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now lots of people are making that</v>

3093
02:07:42.941 --> 02:07:43.720
<v Speaker 2>transition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3094
02:07:43.720 --> 02:07:46.180
<v Speaker 2>like the people I talked about in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>Baltimore bicycle works.</v>

3095
02:07:46.180 --> 02:07:47.560
<v Speaker 2>You've made that transition on their</v>
<v Speaker 2>own.</v>

3096
02:07:47.920 --> 02:07:50.800
<v Speaker 2>But these are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are big social changes.</v>

3097
02:07:50.801 --> 02:07:53.080
<v Speaker 2>We can make that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>

3098
02:07:53.140 --> 02:07:55.180
<v Speaker 2>one of these that's so important is</v>
<v Speaker 2>about saying to people like,</v>

3099
02:07:55.990 --> 02:07:58.960
<v Speaker 2>it sounds to me like no one said to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>

3100
02:07:59.170 --> 02:08:02.230
<v Speaker 2>the fact that he fucking hate this</v>
<v Speaker 2>school is a sign that you are more</v>

3101
02:08:02.231 --> 02:08:03.970
<v Speaker 2>likely to be successful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not less,</v>

3102
02:08:03.971 --> 02:08:06.310
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The things that will make you a success</v>

3103
02:08:06.311 --> 02:08:10.510
<v Speaker 2>in your life are the things that this</v>
<v Speaker 2>school is trying to be out of you right</v>

3104
02:08:10.511 --> 02:08:11.171
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just presuming,</v>

3105
02:08:11.171 --> 02:08:13.490
<v Speaker 2>not literally be out of you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but mentally be you.</v>

3106
02:08:13.780 --> 02:08:16.450
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in a sense that that's what we need</v>

3107
02:08:16.451 --> 02:08:19.300
<v Speaker 2>to say to a lot of people about a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>these forms of discomfort.</v>

3108
02:08:19.660 --> 02:08:22.840
<v Speaker 2>It's not a sign of craziness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes perfect sense.</v>

3109
02:08:22.841 --> 02:08:25.480
<v Speaker 2>You feel this way and you're right to</v>
<v Speaker 2>feel this way.</v>

3110
02:08:25.610 --> 02:08:29.800
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if that's what's causing all</v>
<v Speaker 2>these children to be on adderall and on,</v>

3111
02:08:30.190 --> 02:08:31.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all that.</v>

3112
02:08:31.101 --> 02:08:33.680
<v Speaker 2>The various stimulants they put kids on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3113
02:08:33.681 --> 02:08:35.950
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Prozac and all the different things that</v>

3114
02:08:35.951 --> 02:08:36.750
<v Speaker 2>they do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A,</v>

3115
02:08:36.750 --> 02:08:39.690
<v Speaker 2>it's literally because they're trapped</v>
<v Speaker 2>in this thing and they can't do it and</v>

3116
02:08:39.710 --> 02:08:40.990
<v Speaker 2>they can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can't do it.</v>

3117
02:08:40.991 --> 02:08:43.570
<v Speaker 2>And it's just they can't concentrate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they give them something.</v>

3118
02:08:43.820 --> 02:08:45.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they give them this pill and that</v>

3119
02:08:45.131 --> 02:08:48.610
<v Speaker 2>pill turns him into a worker robot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's related to a lot of the things</v>

3120
02:08:48.611 --> 02:08:50.890
<v Speaker 2>we've talked about as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Increasing competition,</v>

3121
02:08:50.891 --> 02:08:53.500
<v Speaker 2>for example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So parents are in such an unequal</v>

3122
02:08:53.501 --> 02:08:54.500
<v Speaker 2>society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you,</v>

3123
02:08:54.510 --> 02:08:57.880
<v Speaker 2>if you have a society like Norway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where if a kid doesn't do well,</v>

3124
02:08:57.900 --> 02:08:59.170
<v Speaker 2>they're going to have a good life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you could,</v>

3125
02:08:59.171 --> 02:09:01.270
<v Speaker 2>does really well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to have a good life.</v>

3126
02:09:01.440 --> 02:09:01.930
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3127
02:09:01.930 --> 02:09:04.300
<v Speaker 2>there's less anxiety about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my kids falling behind.</v>

3128
02:09:04.500 --> 02:09:06.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If your kid falls behind,</v>

3129
02:09:06.160 --> 02:09:08.020
<v Speaker 2>they can have a really fucking terrible</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3130
02:09:08.050 --> 02:09:08.740
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right here too.</v>

3131
02:09:08.740 --> 02:09:11.500
<v Speaker 2>But the counter that is rich kids don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>do well at all.</v>

3132
02:09:11.920 --> 02:09:12.910
<v Speaker 2>Miserable as hell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3133
02:09:12.940 --> 02:09:16.150
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's a real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A real problem with kids that don't have</v>

3134
02:09:16.151 --> 02:09:17.620
<v Speaker 2>to do well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think this,</v>

3135
02:09:17.680 --> 02:09:19.120
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got society that drugs,</v>

3136
02:09:19.121 --> 02:09:22.210
<v Speaker 2>kids at the bottom to shut up these kids</v>
<v Speaker 2>in foster care who are traumatized,</v>

3137
02:09:22.211 --> 02:09:25.780
<v Speaker 2>not being looked after there being drug</v>
<v Speaker 2>to just basically make them dose aisle.</v>

3138
02:09:26.140 --> 02:09:29.080
<v Speaker 2>You've got kids at the top who are drug</v>
<v Speaker 2>to make them compete.</v>

3139
02:09:29.081 --> 02:09:30.760
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I've got a friend who's a Wall</v>

3140
02:09:30.761 --> 02:09:32.930
<v Speaker 2>Street banker who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3141
02:09:33.270 --> 02:09:34.440
<v Speaker 2>per his kid on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>

3142
02:09:34.480 --> 02:09:35.313
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3143
02:09:35.320 --> 02:09:38.320
<v Speaker 2>corrupt adderall originally one of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>stimulant drugs when he was a young</v>

3144
02:09:38.321 --> 02:09:40.990
<v Speaker 2>teenager cause he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but every other fucking kid in the class</v>

3145
02:09:40.991 --> 02:09:41.570
<v Speaker 2>is on it.</v>

3146
02:09:41.570 --> 02:09:45.160
<v Speaker 2>So if he doesn't go on it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's falling behind.</v>

3147
02:09:45.720 --> 02:09:47.290
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you have the,</v>

3148
02:09:47.291 --> 02:09:47.920
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what a,</v>

3149
02:09:47.920 --> 02:09:51.130
<v Speaker 2>what a sick culture is giving the</v>
<v Speaker 2>children a cocaine like drug.</v>

3150
02:09:51.410 --> 02:09:53.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To make them compete in,</v>

3151
02:09:53.910 --> 02:09:57.130
<v Speaker 2>in an unnatural way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the fucked up part is it works.</v>

3152
02:09:57.670 --> 02:09:58.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well essentially,</v>

3153
02:09:58.930 --> 02:09:59.890
<v Speaker 2>so the research,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is interesting,</v>

3154
02:09:59.891 --> 02:10:00.940
<v Speaker 2>I think since the things worth pointing</v>
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>

3155
02:10:00.941 --> 02:10:02.570
<v Speaker 2>I'm worried about this in my book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>

3156
02:10:02.920 --> 02:10:07.920
<v Speaker 2>the actually there's evidence that um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kids develop tolerance to it over time,</v>

3157
02:10:08.051 --> 02:10:10.420
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So actually initially it works really,</v>

3158
02:10:10.421 --> 02:10:13.780
<v Speaker 2>really well and then gradually have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>get higher and higher doses until</v>

3159
02:10:13.781 --> 02:10:15.490
<v Speaker 2>eventually they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3160
02:10:15.910 --> 02:10:19.260
<v Speaker 2>there's a maximum limit it all day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

3161
02:10:19.300 --> 02:10:21.700
<v Speaker 2>but then you have this real problem</v>
<v Speaker 2>where actually if you then take the kid</v>

3162
02:10:21.701 --> 02:10:24.430
<v Speaker 2>off it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they will experience really severe</v>

3163
02:10:24.460 --> 02:10:25.420
<v Speaker 2>withdrawal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3164
02:10:25.750 --> 02:10:27.250
<v Speaker 2>And we'll often,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what that's misinterpreted is,</v>

3165
02:10:27.251 --> 02:10:28.930
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at what happens to my kid when I</v>

3166
02:10:28.931 --> 02:10:29.380
<v Speaker 2>take him off.</v>

3167
02:10:29.380 --> 02:10:30.161
<v Speaker 2>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

3168
02:10:30.161 --> 02:10:32.050
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not the baseline of your kid.</v>

3169
02:10:32.080 --> 02:10:36.170
<v Speaker 2>That's your kid in withdrawal from pain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like remarkable.</v>

3170
02:10:36.230 --> 02:10:37.970
<v Speaker 2>I mean I had a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I spoke about this before,</v>

3171
02:10:37.971 --> 02:10:41.030
<v Speaker 2>so I think I can say I had a very close</v>
<v Speaker 2>relative who had a cocaine addiction.</v>

3172
02:10:41.450 --> 02:10:43.910
<v Speaker 2>And I remember at the height of her</v>
<v Speaker 2>cocaine addiction,</v>

3173
02:10:44.300 --> 02:10:45.133
<v Speaker 2>she had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3174
02:10:45.250 --> 02:10:46.570
<v Speaker 2>my neck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of my,</v>

3175
02:10:46.690 --> 02:10:49.820
<v Speaker 2>a young relative of mine that's friend's</v>
<v Speaker 2>prices ambiguously.</v>

3176
02:10:50.090 --> 02:10:51.170
<v Speaker 2>Who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3177
02:10:51.470 --> 02:10:55.060
<v Speaker 2>she was drugging with Ritalin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The doctor given it cause he didn't want</v>

3178
02:10:55.061 --> 02:10:57.890
<v Speaker 2>to focus cause he was traumatized</v>
<v Speaker 2>because his mother was a cocaine addict.</v>

3179
02:10:57.891 --> 02:11:00.990
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I remember she used to go drive into</v>

3180
02:11:01.010 --> 02:11:03.710
<v Speaker 2>school in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She would snort a line of coke before</v>

3181
02:11:03.711 --> 02:11:05.930
<v Speaker 2>she went.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then in the car he'd have to swallow</v>

3182
02:11:05.931 --> 02:11:07.160
<v Speaker 2>his cocaine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like pill.</v>

3183
02:11:07.161 --> 02:11:12.161
<v Speaker 2>And I thought what a crazy culture that</v>
<v Speaker 2>her cocaine use is illegal and would end</v>

3184
02:11:13.461 --> 02:11:16.070
<v Speaker 2>up with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had been criminally punished and his</v>

3185
02:11:16.071 --> 02:11:19.070
<v Speaker 2>cocaine lights substances required by</v>
<v Speaker 2>the police.</v>

3186
02:11:19.400 --> 02:11:20.690
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we required not required by the police</v>

3187
02:11:20.700 --> 02:11:23.300
<v Speaker 2>are required by the school and mandated</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the doctor.</v>

3188
02:11:23.450 --> 02:11:26.540
<v Speaker 2>What a crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see what a culture that is fucked up</v>

3189
02:11:26.570 --> 02:11:30.500
<v Speaker 2>about how it thinks about altering</v>
<v Speaker 2>itself chemically about children,</v>

3190
02:11:30.501 --> 02:11:34.300
<v Speaker 2>about connection and that and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that my relative was very deprived.</v>

3191
02:11:34.320 --> 02:11:37.970
<v Speaker 2>The capacity to understand what was</v>
<v Speaker 2>happening to this is the coolest thing</v>

3192
02:11:37.971 --> 02:11:39.680
<v Speaker 2>we've done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you just give people these,</v>

3193
02:11:39.830 --> 02:11:42.380
<v Speaker 2>these ridiculously simplistic stories</v>
<v Speaker 2>about addiction,</v>

3194
02:11:42.381 --> 02:11:45.350
<v Speaker 2>it's just the chemical hook or this</v>
<v Speaker 2>ridiculously simplistic story about</v>

3195
02:11:45.351 --> 02:11:47.180
<v Speaker 2>depression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just a chemical imbalance.</v>

3196
02:11:47.570 --> 02:11:50.360
<v Speaker 2>It's like we say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you cut them off from understanding the</v>

3197
02:11:50.361 --> 02:11:52.280
<v Speaker 2>thing that's right in front of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And sometimes I think with,</v>

3198
02:11:52.520 --> 02:11:55.310
<v Speaker 2>with both my books were chasing the</v>
<v Speaker 2>scream and lost connections at times I</v>

3199
02:11:55.311 --> 02:11:57.500
<v Speaker 2>thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do I even need to say this?</v>

3200
02:11:57.501 --> 02:11:58.970
<v Speaker 2>It's so fucking Banal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3201
02:11:59.390 --> 02:12:01.820
<v Speaker 2>If you're lonely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're insecure,</v>

3202
02:12:01.821 --> 02:12:03.900
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but actually he does need to be.</v>

3203
02:12:03.900 --> 02:12:05.810
<v Speaker 2>So when you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you say it's people,</v>

3204
02:12:06.380 --> 02:12:09.560
<v Speaker 2>it's a very unusual position to be in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>position where you were saying something</v>

3205
02:12:09.561 --> 02:12:13.670
<v Speaker 2>that is both unbelievably obvious and</v>
<v Speaker 2>really quite radical.</v>

3206
02:12:13.730 --> 02:12:14.660
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a weird,</v>

3207
02:12:14.900 --> 02:12:17.990
<v Speaker 2>I can't think of managing it's common</v>
<v Speaker 2>sense but it's not common.</v>

3208
02:12:18.650 --> 02:12:20.840
<v Speaker 2>That's what got hungry by the time</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're really is what it is.</v>

3209
02:12:20.841 --> 02:12:22.610
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not a common understanding.</v>

3210
02:12:22.850 --> 02:12:25.800
<v Speaker 2>Now I want to get in to this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3211
02:12:26.120 --> 02:12:29.390
<v Speaker 2>with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about the criticisms of your work</v>

3212
02:12:29.630 --> 02:12:31.650
<v Speaker 2>and how have you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have you taken that in?</v>

3213
02:12:31.660 --> 02:12:36.110
<v Speaker 2>If you debated anyone about your work?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause I read quite a few things online,</v>

3214
02:12:36.620 --> 02:12:38.630
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that were very critical and I didn't</v>

3215
02:12:38.631 --> 02:12:40.160
<v Speaker 2>agree with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't agree with what they were</v>

3216
02:12:40.161 --> 02:12:42.380
<v Speaker 2>saying but I wanted to get your take on</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

3217
02:12:42.530 --> 02:12:43.890
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there were a few things,</v>

3218
02:12:43.940 --> 02:12:45.260
<v Speaker 2>few points that have been made.</v>

3219
02:12:45.560 --> 02:12:47.030
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were a few pieces that were</v>

3220
02:12:47.031 --> 02:12:50.240
<v Speaker 2>written as soon as the book came out by</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychiatrist who admitted that to be</v>

3221
02:12:50.241 --> 02:12:52.400
<v Speaker 2>fair to the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hadn't read the book and they were</v>

3222
02:12:52.401 --> 02:12:55.550
<v Speaker 2>responding to an extract from the book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And obviously in the next structure you</v>

3223
02:12:55.551 --> 02:12:57.350
<v Speaker 2>can't make every point you want to make.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3224
02:12:57.351 --> 02:12:59.960
<v Speaker 2>So is 100,000 what was the extract?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was the,</v>

3225
02:13:00.170 --> 02:13:04.430
<v Speaker 2>so what I thought I was saying is even</v>
<v Speaker 2>though the piece I think break clearly</v>

3226
02:13:04.431 --> 02:13:07.490
<v Speaker 2>didn't say this is what they thought I</v>
<v Speaker 2>was saying is chemical anti depressants</v>

3227
02:13:07.491 --> 02:13:09.740
<v Speaker 2>are bad for everyone and people should</v>
<v Speaker 2>stop taking them.</v>

3228
02:13:10.040 --> 02:13:12.590
<v Speaker 2>If I had said that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would be totally right to criticize</v>

3229
02:13:12.591 --> 02:13:13.850
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not my position.</v>

3230
02:13:14.180 --> 02:13:17.380
<v Speaker 2>My position.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Easy way to criticize you just cherry</v>

3231
02:13:17.390 --> 02:13:20.180
<v Speaker 2>pick and my position is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what we said before,</v>

3232
02:13:20.390 --> 02:13:23.150
<v Speaker 2>chemical anti depressants give you a 1.8</v>
<v Speaker 2>points on the Hamilton scale,</v>

3233
02:13:23.151 --> 02:13:23.450
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3234
02:13:23.450 --> 02:13:26.330
<v Speaker 2>That's not nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not much on average,</v>

3235
02:13:26.331 --> 02:13:28.400
<v Speaker 2>but it's not nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people,</v>

3236
02:13:28.401 --> 02:13:30.110
<v Speaker 2>like for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of my relatives,</v>

3237
02:13:30.111 --> 02:13:31.560
<v Speaker 2>the one that we talked about who is</v>
<v Speaker 2>trapped,</v>

3238
02:13:32.400 --> 02:13:35.040
<v Speaker 2>she takes chemical antidepressants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think she's right to take them right?</v>

3239
02:13:35.041 --> 02:13:37.890
<v Speaker 2>She's got very limited margin change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's not experiencing extreme side</v>

3240
02:13:37.891 --> 02:13:41.750
<v Speaker 2>effects as lots of people do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think she's right to caring for her at</v>

3241
02:13:41.751 --> 02:13:44.670
<v Speaker 2>1.8 points in a Hamilton scale is worth</v>
<v Speaker 2>having.</v>

3242
02:13:45.210 --> 02:13:47.010
<v Speaker 2>But it's not solving a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3243
02:13:47.220 --> 02:13:49.530
<v Speaker 2>It's not solving the problem for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>vast majority of people.</v>

3244
02:13:49.980 --> 02:13:52.380
<v Speaker 2>And so I think there's been some</v>
<v Speaker 2>criticisms that are,</v>

3245
02:13:54.090 --> 02:13:57.720
<v Speaker 2>he's telling people to stop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a dangerous and terrible thing to</v>

3246
02:13:57.721 --> 02:13:59.080
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3247
02:13:59.250 --> 02:14:01.800
<v Speaker 2>so that's the most response to that is</v>
<v Speaker 2>read the book.</v>

3248
02:14:01.830 --> 02:14:03.780
<v Speaker 2>Cause I don't say that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I to say explicitly,</v>

3249
02:14:03.781 --> 02:14:05.090
<v Speaker 2>you should carry on taking them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If for you,</v>

3250
02:14:05.200 --> 02:14:07.170
<v Speaker 2>the benefits outweigh the side effects.</v>

3251
02:14:07.590 --> 02:14:10.040
<v Speaker 2>Another criticism which I have more</v>
<v Speaker 2>sympathy for in,</v>

3252
02:14:10.070 --> 02:14:11.550
<v Speaker 2>I understand where it's coming from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>

3253
02:14:12.210 --> 02:14:15.300
<v Speaker 2>is it's more like an ideological</v>
<v Speaker 2>misunderstanding.</v>

3254
02:14:16.070 --> 02:14:18.750
<v Speaker 2>Like we were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we live in such an individualistic</v>

3255
02:14:18.751 --> 02:14:19.441
<v Speaker 2>culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

3256
02:14:19.441 --> 02:14:22.530
<v Speaker 2>if someone comes along and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we basically think there's two ways of</v>

3257
02:14:22.531 --> 02:14:23.520
<v Speaker 2>thinking about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3258
02:14:24.480 --> 02:14:28.060
<v Speaker 2>Either you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your depression and your anxiety,</v>

3259
02:14:28.061 --> 02:14:30.150
<v Speaker 2>your addiction to due to a biological</v>
<v Speaker 2>problem,</v>

3260
02:14:30.450 --> 02:14:32.280
<v Speaker 2>in which case you deserve love and</v>
<v Speaker 2>support.</v>

3261
02:14:32.850 --> 02:14:36.060
<v Speaker 2>Or if you dismantle the biological</v>
<v Speaker 2>story,</v>

3262
02:14:36.061 --> 02:14:37.770
<v Speaker 2>what a lot of people hear is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>

3263
02:14:37.771 --> 02:14:39.870
<v Speaker 2>you're saying it's my fault that I'm a</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck up,</v>

3264
02:14:39.920 --> 02:14:42.960
<v Speaker 2>that I've got to solve this on my own.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And lots of people turning around and</v>

3265
02:14:42.961 --> 02:14:43.471
<v Speaker 2>going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3266
02:14:43.471 --> 02:14:45.660
<v Speaker 2>I can't fucking go and democratize my</v>
<v Speaker 2>workplace.</v>

3267
02:14:45.661 --> 02:14:49.810
<v Speaker 2>I can't fucking go and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take a load of Iowaska and learn what</v>

3268
02:14:50.420 --> 02:14:52.410
<v Speaker 2>they're just saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are you talking about?</v>

3269
02:14:52.770 --> 02:14:54.350
<v Speaker 2>And I think because I'm talking in this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

3270
02:14:54.360 --> 02:14:58.270
<v Speaker 2>this third category,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is biology is real,</v>

3271
02:14:58.820 --> 02:15:01.170
<v Speaker 2>is real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but most of the drivers of this,</v>

3272
02:15:01.171 --> 02:15:02.970
<v Speaker 2>our social,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that in the way we live,</v>

3273
02:15:03.420 --> 02:15:06.960
<v Speaker 2>because for so long we've been trained</v>
<v Speaker 2>to not think in social terms.</v>

3274
02:15:07.260 --> 02:15:09.780
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of people just literally</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't get what I'm saying,</v>

3275
02:15:09.840 --> 02:15:11.250
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when I was a kid,</v>

3276
02:15:11.251 --> 02:15:13.950
<v Speaker 2>Margaret Thatcher said the premise at</v>
<v Speaker 2>the time said,</v>

3277
02:15:14.460 --> 02:15:17.280
<v Speaker 2>there's no such thing as society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's only individuals and their</v>

3278
02:15:17.281 --> 02:15:18.420
<v Speaker 2>families.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

3279
02:15:18.421 --> 02:15:23.100
<v Speaker 2>I never liked Margaret Thatcher,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this debate has made me realize how</v>

3280
02:15:23.101 --> 02:15:24.540
<v Speaker 2>much I internalize that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3281
02:15:24.570 --> 02:15:27.960
<v Speaker 2>I was depressed that 13 years I'd</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking studied social sciences.</v>

3282
02:15:27.961 --> 02:15:29.940
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It never even occurred to me.</v>

3283
02:15:29.941 --> 02:15:32.160
<v Speaker 2>There was a societal component to how</v>
<v Speaker 2>bad I felt.</v>

3284
02:15:32.220 --> 02:15:34.860
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was kind of like a thatcherite to</v>

3285
02:15:34.861 --> 02:15:37.380
<v Speaker 2>my own pain and distress.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you see what I mean?</v>

3286
02:15:37.650 --> 02:15:40.200
<v Speaker 2>And I think we've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we've so individualized and</v>

3287
02:15:40.201 --> 02:15:42.990
<v Speaker 2>internally we start internalize this</v>
<v Speaker 2>individualism.</v>

3288
02:15:43.440 --> 02:15:45.070
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think people are understanding.</v>

3289
02:15:45.080 --> 02:15:46.390
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were riffing on the extracts.</v>

3290
02:15:46.410 --> 02:15:48.660
<v Speaker 2>These are not people who've read the</v>
<v Speaker 2>book in the main,</v>

3291
02:15:49.200 --> 02:15:52.230
<v Speaker 2>but I think it was kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>understandable for them to be like,</v>

3292
02:15:52.710 --> 02:15:53.910
<v Speaker 2>fuck you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't do that.</v>

3293
02:15:54.260 --> 02:15:56.070
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can see why they're saying that I'm</v>

3294
02:15:56.071 --> 02:15:58.260
<v Speaker 2>not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I wouldn't push back on them so hard</v>

3295
02:15:58.261 --> 02:15:59.094
<v Speaker 2>because think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3296
02:15:59.310 --> 02:16:01.700
<v Speaker 2>there are narrow margins and this is why</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need to check.</v>

3297
02:16:01.890 --> 02:16:03.960
<v Speaker 2>And people get that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you talk about car accidents,</v>

3298
02:16:03.961 --> 02:16:07.770
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We individual drivers should drive</v>

3299
02:16:07.771 --> 02:16:09.320
<v Speaker 2>safely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3300
02:16:09.720 --> 02:16:12.390
<v Speaker 2>but we don't just leave car safety up to</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

3301
02:16:12.391 --> 02:16:15.840
<v Speaker 2>We have airbags and seat belts and speed</v>
<v Speaker 2>limits.</v>

3302
02:16:16.020 --> 02:16:18.860
<v Speaker 2>Driving tests were dry arrest people</v>
<v Speaker 2>under Duis,</v>

3303
02:16:18.900 --> 02:16:20.550
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we just took away all those things</v>

3304
02:16:20.551 --> 02:16:22.080
<v Speaker 2>and just said to individual drivers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

3305
02:16:22.090 --> 02:16:25.350
<v Speaker 2>drivers and pedestrians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pedestrians take care of drivers,</v>

3306
02:16:25.351 --> 02:16:27.750
<v Speaker 2>take care,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we would have far more people dying in</v>

3307
02:16:27.751 --> 02:16:29.040
<v Speaker 2>car accidents than we do now.</v>

3308
02:16:29.050 --> 02:16:31.570
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we accept that there's individual,</v>

3309
02:16:31.630 --> 02:16:33.220
<v Speaker 2>an individual role,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's a social role,</v>

3310
02:16:33.221 --> 02:16:34.840
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The whole society deals with the problem</v>

3311
02:16:34.841 --> 02:16:38.400
<v Speaker 2>of car accidents and what I'm saying is</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole society should deal with the</v>

3312
02:16:38.401 --> 02:16:41.290
<v Speaker 2>problem with depression and anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need social changes like</v>

3313
02:16:41.291 --> 02:16:44.470
<v Speaker 2>democratizing workplaces is one we've</v>
<v Speaker 2>talked about a lot that reduced the</v>

3314
02:16:44.471 --> 02:16:46.900
<v Speaker 2>reasons why people are so depressed and</v>
<v Speaker 2>anxious in the first place,</v>

3315
02:16:47.170 --> 02:16:49.420
<v Speaker 2>but I think in a society that is so</v>
<v Speaker 2>devalued,</v>

3316
02:16:49.421 --> 02:16:52.870
<v Speaker 2>the idea of the social,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just I may as well be speaking</v>

3317
02:16:52.871 --> 02:16:54.460
<v Speaker 2>fucking Swedish where they could</v>
<v Speaker 2>understand it.</v>

3318
02:16:54.461 --> 02:16:55.300
<v Speaker 2>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see what I mean?</v>

3319
02:16:55.640 --> 02:16:59.420
<v Speaker 3>I think they're just neglecting to</v>
<v Speaker 3>consider the possibility that some of</v>

3320
02:16:59.421 --> 02:17:04.421
<v Speaker 3>the factors are because of your life and</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the the social aspects,</v>

3321
02:17:04.431 --> 02:17:06.320
<v Speaker 3>the physical aspects,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the exercise,</v>

3322
02:17:06.321 --> 02:17:07.910
<v Speaker 3>the Diet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all those various things.</v>

3323
02:17:08.210 --> 02:17:10.730
<v Speaker 3>There's many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many people that do certain neglecting</v>

3324
02:17:10.731 --> 02:17:15.731
<v Speaker 3>to take those even into consideration.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I also think people work way too much.</v>

3325
02:17:16.190 --> 02:17:18.170
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that's the way to live</v>
<v Speaker 3>your life.</v>

3326
02:17:18.440 --> 02:17:21.650
<v Speaker 3>I think we've got a really bad system</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think the system has existed for</v>

3327
02:17:21.651 --> 02:17:24.200
<v Speaker 3>so long that we assume that this is the</v>
<v Speaker 3>only way to live,</v>

3328
02:17:24.290 --> 02:17:27.440
<v Speaker 3>that you have to do a 40 hour work week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's ridiculous.</v>

3329
02:17:27.710 --> 02:17:31.340
<v Speaker 3>I think we should work maybe four days a</v>
<v Speaker 3>week and it might be three.</v>

3330
02:17:31.760 --> 02:17:32.960
<v Speaker 3>We might,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we may be,</v>

3331
02:17:32.961 --> 02:17:36.080
<v Speaker 3>people would be more productive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They kicked ass for three days a week</v>

3332
02:17:36.081 --> 02:17:37.640
<v Speaker 3>and then had a fun time for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>

3333
02:17:37.910 --> 02:17:38.930
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe,</v>

3334
02:17:39.140 --> 02:17:42.710
<v Speaker 3>maybe it's like one on one off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one on one off,</v>

3335
02:17:42.711 --> 02:17:43.580
<v Speaker 3>one on one off.</v>

3336
02:17:43.610 --> 02:17:45.800
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it's like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And just that's the way we live life.</v>

3337
02:17:45.950 --> 02:17:48.560
<v Speaker 3>Like have a fucking work day and have a</v>
<v Speaker 3>day where you don't work.</v>

3338
02:17:48.800 --> 02:17:52.730
<v Speaker 3>Have you choose to live to work more</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you know you're trying to pursue</v>

3339
02:17:52.731 --> 02:17:55.310
<v Speaker 3>something and you're a dedicated person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have a job.</v>

3340
02:17:55.311 --> 02:17:58.910
<v Speaker 3>That's one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I just think this soul sucking grind</v>

3341
02:17:58.940 --> 02:17:59.630
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3342
02:17:59.630 --> 02:18:04.630
<v Speaker 3>getting out of college 21 and grinding</v>
<v Speaker 3>until you're 65 and the new look forward</v>

3343
02:18:04.881 --> 02:18:07.550
<v Speaker 3>to your golden years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're dying motherfucker.</v>

3344
02:18:07.640 --> 02:18:10.240
<v Speaker 3>There's no golden years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's all horse shit you,</v>

3345
02:18:10.241 --> 02:18:11.960
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you watch it on golden pond too many</v>

3346
02:18:11.961 --> 02:18:13.700
<v Speaker 3>times,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to make it.</v>

3347
02:18:13.820 --> 02:18:17.350
<v Speaker 3>The only</v>
<v Speaker 3>bad example,</v>

3348
02:18:17.360 --> 02:18:18.193
<v Speaker 3>he hit his daughter,</v>

3349
02:18:18.500 --> 02:18:21.850
<v Speaker 2>maybe the golden girls movie is a really</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit feel much epilepsy please.</v>

3350
02:18:21.851 --> 02:18:22.810
<v Speaker 2>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll wash it for the first time.</v>

3351
02:18:22.840 --> 02:18:24.980
<v Speaker 2>I played recently by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was another thing going on.</v>

3352
02:18:25.130 --> 02:18:27.320
<v Speaker 2>There's another thing going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had to make sure I that miss my</v>

3353
02:18:27.321 --> 02:18:28.490
<v Speaker 2>flight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's nothing going on,</v>

3354
02:18:28.491 --> 02:18:33.410
<v Speaker 2>which is</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we've done is we've told people the</v>

3355
02:18:33.411 --> 02:18:37.850
<v Speaker 2>path out of stigma is to say that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>problem is just biological.</v>

3356
02:18:37.870 --> 02:18:38.480
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3357
02:18:38.480 --> 02:18:41.330
<v Speaker 2>So we said people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should not be criticized for having</v>

3358
02:18:41.331 --> 02:18:43.490
<v Speaker 2>an imbalance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We even more than that,</v>

3359
02:18:43.520 --> 02:18:46.880
<v Speaker 2>it's like having a pancreas disease.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We just need to give you a medication.</v>

3360
02:18:47.030 --> 02:18:50.030
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've told people you should not be</v>

3361
02:18:50.031 --> 02:18:52.010
<v Speaker 2>judged for your depression,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anxiety,</v>

3362
02:18:52.011 --> 02:18:53.630
<v Speaker 2>addiction because it's a biological</v>
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>

3363
02:18:54.410 --> 02:18:56.900
<v Speaker 2>I entirely agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously people should not be judged</v>

3364
02:18:56.960 --> 02:18:58.550
<v Speaker 2>for their anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 2>depression or addiction,</v>

3365
02:18:58.880 --> 02:19:00.200
<v Speaker 2>but actually it's a really interesting</v>
<v Speaker 2>experiment.</v>

3366
02:19:00.200 --> 02:19:02.710
<v Speaker 2>They show you that this is just a</v>
<v Speaker 2>complete Monday's first trigger me and</v>

3367
02:19:02.711 --> 02:19:05.690
<v Speaker 2>this is I to be an amazing</v>
<v Speaker 2>neuroscientists call Mark Lewis,</v>

3368
02:19:05.720 --> 02:19:07.340
<v Speaker 2>who I was talking about this and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3369
02:19:07.341 --> 02:19:09.620
<v Speaker 2>I'm worried cause you explaining a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the things we've talked about to me</v>

3370
02:19:09.770 --> 02:19:11.810
<v Speaker 2>early in my research.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>

3371
02:19:11.811 --> 02:19:13.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm worried about this mark,</v>

3372
02:19:13.200 --> 02:19:15.290
<v Speaker 2>because won't this just reintroduced</v>
<v Speaker 2>stigma,</v>

3373
02:19:15.291 --> 02:19:16.370
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we're saying it's not just</v>

3374
02:19:16.371 --> 02:19:17.270
<v Speaker 2>biological.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>

3375
02:19:17.720 --> 02:19:20.990
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did anyone ever doubt but leprosy or</v>

3376
02:19:20.991 --> 02:19:23.310
<v Speaker 2>AIDS were biological problems?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3377
02:19:23.380 --> 02:19:25.160
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Literally nobody ever doubted that.</v>

3378
02:19:25.161 --> 02:19:27.890
<v Speaker 2>Zero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might have noticed there was some</v>

3379
02:19:27.891 --> 02:19:30.710
<v Speaker 2>stigma against leprosy and aids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do you think saying something is</v>

3380
02:19:30.711 --> 02:19:33.980
<v Speaker 2>biological removes the stigma around it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought I say it again.</v>

3381
02:19:33.981 --> 02:19:35.090
<v Speaker 2>It's a simple point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The wow,</v>

3382
02:19:35.091 --> 02:19:37.490
<v Speaker 2>I'd never thought of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's actually an experiment by</v>

3383
02:19:37.491 --> 02:19:39.770
<v Speaker 2>women I interviewed called a Professor</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sheila matter,</v>

3384
02:19:40.340 --> 02:19:42.050
<v Speaker 2>which looked at this question of stigma.</v>

3385
02:19:42.050 --> 02:19:43.310
<v Speaker 2>She,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so she wanted to pick her out,</v>

3386
02:19:44.240 --> 02:19:47.180
<v Speaker 2>which is more de stigmatizing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>telling people,</v>

3387
02:19:47.570 --> 02:19:48.380
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

3388
02:19:48.380 --> 02:19:53.240
<v Speaker 2>that mental health problems are caused</v>
<v Speaker 2>by your biology or saying that caused by</v>

3389
02:19:53.241 --> 02:19:55.880
<v Speaker 2>your life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's what they do is it's a little bit</v>

3390
02:19:55.881 --> 02:19:57.680
<v Speaker 2>of a complex experiment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's worth explaining.</v>

3391
02:19:58.340 --> 02:20:00.080
<v Speaker 2>Say you're the guy who's taking part in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the experiment.</v>

3392
02:20:00.110 --> 02:20:03.140
<v Speaker 2>They bring you in and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>before the experiment begins,</v>

3393
02:20:03.290 --> 02:20:05.240
<v Speaker 2>we just want you to sit here and fill in</v>
<v Speaker 2>a questionnaire,</v>

3394
02:20:05.420 --> 02:20:07.130
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is you don't realize,</v>

3395
02:20:07.131 --> 02:20:10.160
<v Speaker 2>but this is actually the experiment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's you're sitting next to someone else</v>

3396
02:20:10.161 --> 02:20:13.760
<v Speaker 2>who you don't realize as an actor and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get chatting and the actable sup.</v>

3397
02:20:14.120 --> 02:20:16.910
<v Speaker 2>They'll run it two ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes the actor will say,</v>

3398
02:20:16.911 --> 02:20:20.420
<v Speaker 2>I've got a mental health problem because</v>
<v Speaker 2>of my biology,</v>

3399
02:20:20.900 --> 02:20:23.930
<v Speaker 2>and sometimes he'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got a mental health problem because</v>

3400
02:20:23.931 --> 02:20:25.460
<v Speaker 2>of bad things that have happened to me.</v>

3401
02:20:25.610 --> 02:20:27.710
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you told the experiments beginning</v>

3402
02:20:27.711 --> 02:20:30.770
<v Speaker 2>come through to this room and you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>told you joe have got to teach this</v>

3403
02:20:30.771 --> 02:20:32.620
<v Speaker 2>other person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The person you don't realize as an actor</v>

3404
02:20:32.990 --> 02:20:35.630
<v Speaker 2>a pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a patent on a computer is</v>

3405
02:20:35.631 --> 02:20:39.380
<v Speaker 2>we're testing how well people learn</v>
<v Speaker 2>patterns and every once you've taught it</v>

3406
02:20:39.381 --> 02:20:41.120
<v Speaker 2>to him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every time he gets it wrong,</v>

3407
02:20:41.121 --> 02:20:43.160
<v Speaker 2>I want you to push this button and this</v>
<v Speaker 2>button,</v>

3408
02:20:43.161 --> 02:20:45.800
<v Speaker 2>we'll give him a short sharp electric</v>
<v Speaker 2>shock,</v>

3409
02:20:46.040 --> 02:20:47.360
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Won't kill him or anything.</v>

3410
02:20:47.361 --> 02:20:49.030
<v Speaker 2>It's not going to fuck him up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it,</v>

3411
02:20:49.031 --> 02:20:50.480
<v Speaker 2>it's uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3412
02:20:51.260 --> 02:20:54.560
<v Speaker 2>And they wanted to see would there be a</v>
<v Speaker 2>difference in how many electric shocks</v>

3413
02:20:54.561 --> 02:20:58.130
<v Speaker 2>and how hard you hit hit the button,</v>
<v Speaker 2>depending on what you were told,</v>

3414
02:20:58.131 --> 02:21:01.760
<v Speaker 2>what they found was you were</v>
<v Speaker 2>significantly more like you zapped the</v>

3415
02:21:01.761 --> 02:21:05.090
<v Speaker 2>person more and harder if you thought</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the problem is just due to their</v>

3416
02:21:05.091 --> 02:21:08.210
<v Speaker 2>biology than if it was due to things</v>
<v Speaker 2>that happened to them in their lives.</v>

3417
02:21:08.480 --> 02:21:13.190
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's because I think this</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the stuff we're talking about is the</v>

3418
02:21:13.191 --> 02:21:15.500
<v Speaker 2>part that stigma because what it says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if what we're saying is this just this</v>

3419
02:21:15.501 --> 02:21:19.220
<v Speaker 2>class of people who are biologically</v>
<v Speaker 2>different to us and they have this floor</v>

3420
02:21:19.221 --> 02:21:21.370
<v Speaker 2>that you and I don't have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3421
02:21:21.440 --> 02:21:23.060
<v Speaker 2>you can see why that leads to stigma,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3422
02:21:23.061 --> 02:21:26.000
<v Speaker 2>But if what you're saying is actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're all uniquely,</v>

3423
02:21:26.030 --> 02:21:29.960
<v Speaker 2>we're all vulnerable to this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm actually the things that are making</v>

3424
02:21:29.961 --> 02:21:31.520
<v Speaker 2>some people depressed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anxious,</v>

3425
02:21:31.521 --> 02:21:35.300
<v Speaker 2>and addicted and making loads of us just</v>
<v Speaker 2>less happy than we could be less</v>

3426
02:21:35.301 --> 02:21:37.280
<v Speaker 2>fulfilled than we could be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What that does,</v>

3427
02:21:37.281 --> 02:21:39.470
<v Speaker 2>instead of making dividing us into two</v>
<v Speaker 2>tribes,</v>

3428
02:21:39.471 --> 02:21:42.950
<v Speaker 2>it says we're all on a continuum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and actually the fight that will help</v>

3429
02:21:42.951 --> 02:21:47.270
<v Speaker 2>these people who are depressed and</v>
<v Speaker 2>anxious will also improve your life.</v>

3430
02:21:47.300 --> 02:21:49.370
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's to me a much more powerful</v>

3431
02:21:49.371 --> 02:21:49.680
<v Speaker 2>message.</v>

3432
02:21:49.680 --> 02:21:53.660
<v Speaker 2>It's solving a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being an inexplicably biological</v>

3433
02:21:53.661 --> 02:21:58.220
<v Speaker 2>malfunction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a response to things that you can</v>

3434
02:21:58.221 --> 02:21:59.120
<v Speaker 2>see in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3435
02:21:59.150 --> 02:22:00.620
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting that we've always had</v>

3436
02:22:00.621 --> 02:22:02.450
<v Speaker 2>the term sadness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3437
02:22:02.451 --> 02:22:06.110
<v Speaker 2>People have always experienced sadness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you go back and go through</v>

3438
02:22:06.111 --> 02:22:08.240
<v Speaker 2>ancient literature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't see a lot of stories about</v>

3439
02:22:08.241 --> 02:22:12.410
<v Speaker 2>people suffering from depression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a relatively new distinction.</v>

3440
02:22:12.470 --> 02:22:15.440
<v Speaker 2>You did get people who talk about melon</v>
<v Speaker 2>Melancholia.</v>

3441
02:22:15.730 --> 02:22:16.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

3442
02:22:16.440 --> 02:22:21.110
<v Speaker 2>Do you think depression has always the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the state's been acute and extreme</v>

3443
02:22:21.111 --> 02:22:23.630
<v Speaker 2>unhappiness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Always been people living on happy</v>

3444
02:22:23.631 --> 02:22:26.400
<v Speaker 2>lives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the state being depressed</v>

3445
02:22:26.610 --> 02:22:31.610
<v Speaker 1>as being a clinical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychological sort of a diagnosis that's</v>

3446
02:22:31.771 --> 02:22:32.850
<v Speaker 1>relatively recent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3447
02:22:32.851 --> 02:22:36.420
<v Speaker 1>the idea that it's a pathology and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably coming up to,</v>

3448
02:22:36.510 --> 02:22:37.860
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this way you were speaking earlier.</v>

3449
02:22:38.660 --> 02:22:39.990
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we do,</v>

3450
02:22:40.220 --> 02:22:42.750
<v Speaker 1>when we talk about food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the thing of it is you can tell</v>

3451
02:22:42.751 --> 02:22:46.110
<v Speaker 1>him what was that British when I first</v>
<v Speaker 1>came to the,</v>

3452
02:22:46.740 --> 02:22:49.250
<v Speaker 1>the u s I never remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember the first time someone ever</v>

3453
02:22:49.260 --> 02:22:52.050
<v Speaker 1>offered me an indigestion pill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which they don't exist.</v>

3454
02:22:52.051 --> 02:22:54.540
<v Speaker 1>Ingestion pill that you can buy them in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3455
02:22:54.650 --> 02:22:56.360
<v Speaker 1>like pepto Bismol or something like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

3456
02:22:56.361 --> 02:22:58.890
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I meant that just saying,</v>

3457
02:22:58.891 --> 02:23:00.510
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but wait,</v>

3458
02:23:01.110 --> 02:23:03.840
<v Speaker 1>indigestion is a sign from your body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're eating too fast.</v>

3459
02:23:03.841 --> 02:23:06.030
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to get rid of that</v>

3460
02:23:06.120 --> 02:23:06.953
<v Speaker 1>signal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll,</v>

3461
02:23:07.300 --> 02:23:09.960
<v Speaker 1>you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll eat too much or hurt yourself.</v>

3462
02:23:09.961 --> 02:23:10.681
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>

3463
02:23:10.681 --> 02:23:11.880
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not a malfunction.</v>

3464
02:23:11.881 --> 02:23:12.840
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a function.</v>

3465
02:23:12.841 --> 02:23:13.674
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3466
02:23:15.720 --> 02:23:16.411
<v Speaker 1>What about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3467
02:23:16.411 --> 02:23:17.940
<v Speaker 1>that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it comes back to so many things we're</v>

3468
02:23:17.941 --> 02:23:21.540
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the things,</v>

3469
02:23:21.541 --> 02:23:25.020
<v Speaker 1>the feelings that we have of distress</v>
<v Speaker 1>are not malfunctions.</v>

3470
02:23:25.340 --> 02:23:27.570
<v Speaker 1>That telling us something is missing in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the environment,</v>

3471
02:23:27.630 --> 02:23:29.550
<v Speaker 1>in the psychology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in our lives.</v>

3472
02:23:29.880 --> 02:23:33.900
<v Speaker 1>They're not fuck ups with as a signal</v>
<v Speaker 1>industry that they,</v>

3473
02:23:33.910 --> 02:23:37.170
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they benefit from feeling that void.</v>

3474
02:23:37.171 --> 02:23:39.600
<v Speaker 1>Like if you've got an issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've got a pill for it and as soon as</v>

3475
02:23:39.690 --> 02:23:41.790
<v Speaker 1>you create that sort of an an</v>
<v Speaker 1>environment,</v>

3476
02:23:41.970 --> 02:23:44.340
<v Speaker 1>they're going to constantly be</v>
<v Speaker 1>innovating and trying to come up with</v>

3477
02:23:44.341 --> 02:23:47.880
<v Speaker 1>new pills for new issues and even create</v>
<v Speaker 1>ailments,</v>

3478
02:23:48.160 --> 02:23:52.080
<v Speaker 1>makeup ailments and come up with</v>
<v Speaker 1>solutions for those ailments.</v>

3479
02:23:52.081 --> 02:23:53.490
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of those are actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've,</v>

3480
02:23:53.580 --> 02:23:55.530
<v Speaker 1>we've shown this on the podcast many</v>
<v Speaker 1>times.</v>

3481
02:23:55.830 --> 02:24:00.630
<v Speaker 1>Those were done by advertising agencies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've actually created names of</v>

3482
02:24:00.631 --> 02:24:04.230
<v Speaker 1>diseases and issues just so they can</v>
<v Speaker 1>come up with solutions.</v>

3483
02:24:04.230 --> 02:24:06.540
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that was most shocking</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the research,</v>

3484
02:24:06.541 --> 02:24:11.541
<v Speaker 1>but the loss connections was realizing</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much of what I had been told was</v>

3485
02:24:12.120 --> 02:24:14.790
<v Speaker 1>invented,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not by scientists but by drug company</v>

3486
02:24:14.791 --> 02:24:16.560
<v Speaker 1>PRS.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it,</v>

3487
02:24:16.620 --> 02:24:19.030
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you an example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two examples that print,</v>

3488
02:24:19.070 --> 02:24:20.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to have to go in and set.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No worries.</v>

3489
02:24:21.650 --> 02:24:23.990
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what got you one other interview before</v>

3490
02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:25.920
<v Speaker 1>my flight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So fuck that interview.</v>

3491
02:24:26.620 --> 02:24:27.890
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The uh,</v>

3492
02:24:29.900 --> 02:24:32.940
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this so everyone knows,</v>

3493
02:24:32.941 --> 02:24:35.370
<v Speaker 1>if you think about taking selfies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3494
02:24:35.420 --> 02:24:37.290
<v Speaker 1>You take 30,</v>
<v Speaker 1>30 selfies,</v>

3495
02:24:37.291 --> 02:24:40.410
<v Speaker 1>you throw away 29 and you only used the</v>
<v Speaker 1>one that can't do that.</v>

3496
02:24:40.411 --> 02:24:42.690
<v Speaker 1>Don't be a bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take a selfie and go with it.</v>

3497
02:24:42.691 --> 02:24:45.150
<v Speaker 1>It's like deniro in the deer hunter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one bullet,</v>

3498
02:24:46.930 --> 02:24:49.290
<v Speaker 1>the three that you already have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3499
02:24:49.300 --> 02:24:50.730
<v Speaker 1>you use the one where you look good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3500
02:24:50.970 --> 02:24:53.770
<v Speaker 1>Turns out in the whole process when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3501
02:24:54.870 --> 02:24:56.550
<v Speaker 1>antidepressants were first being</v>
<v Speaker 1>marketed to us,</v>

3502
02:24:56.551 --> 02:24:58.530
<v Speaker 1>they basically did that with scientific</v>
<v Speaker 1>studies.</v>

3503
02:24:58.740 --> 02:25:01.860
<v Speaker 1>What they did is they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

3504
02:25:02.070 --> 02:25:04.980
<v Speaker 1>they would commission a hundred studies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3505
02:25:05.010 --> 02:25:08.640
<v Speaker 1>90 of them would say mixed results or</v>
<v Speaker 1>poor results.</v>

3506
02:25:08.880 --> 02:25:11.760
<v Speaker 1>Those all got put in the trashcan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the only,</v>

3507
02:25:11.761 --> 02:25:12.361
<v Speaker 1>the ones where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3508
02:25:12.361 --> 02:25:14.250
<v Speaker 1>there's one study I cite in the book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was,</v>

3509
02:25:14.520 --> 02:25:19.520
<v Speaker 1>they tested the drug on 247 people and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they only published the results for 27</v>

3510
02:25:19.711 --> 02:25:21.930
<v Speaker 1>of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who you will not find it hard to guess</v>

3511
02:25:21.931 --> 02:25:23.520
<v Speaker 1>where the 27 for whom it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

3512
02:25:23.530 --> 02:25:24.220
<v Speaker 1>So the early</v>

3513
02:25:24.220 --> 02:25:27.540
<v Speaker 2>results were hugely exaggerated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll remember that when</v>

3514
02:25:27.550 --> 02:25:29.470
<v Speaker 2>antidepressants were first marketed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are told,</v>

3515
02:25:29.471 --> 02:25:31.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'll make you better than well,</v>

3516
02:25:31.690 --> 02:25:32.950
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one says that.</v>

3517
02:25:32.951 --> 02:25:34.210
<v Speaker 2>Now you'll notice that stuff's all gone</v>
<v Speaker 2>away,</v>

3518
02:25:34.211 --> 02:25:35.200
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't happen anymore.</v>

3519
02:25:35.650 --> 02:25:36.820
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there's this huge,</v>

3520
02:25:36.880 --> 02:25:39.760
<v Speaker 2>actually Eliot Spitzer did an amazing</v>
<v Speaker 2>job when he was attorney general in New</v>

3521
02:25:39.760 --> 02:25:41.950
<v Speaker 2>York state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've taken the pharmaceutical companies</v>

3522
02:25:41.951 --> 02:25:44.050
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to court because it's particularly</v>

3523
02:25:44.051 --> 02:25:46.690
<v Speaker 2>affected me when I read it because it</v>
<v Speaker 2>was the drug that I was given as a</v>

3524
02:25:46.691 --> 02:25:47.830
<v Speaker 2>teenager.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

3525
02:25:47.831 --> 02:25:50.440
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>called paroxetine or Paxil in the u s</v>

3526
02:25:50.860 --> 02:25:52.510
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the,</v>

3527
02:25:52.511 --> 02:25:55.870
<v Speaker 2>the company that manufacturers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it literally had a leaked memo from them</v>

3528
02:25:55.871 --> 02:25:58.510
<v Speaker 2>in which they say this doesn't work for</v>
<v Speaker 2>teenagers,</v>

3529
02:25:58.511 --> 02:26:01.360
<v Speaker 2>but that I think the phrase they used</v>
<v Speaker 2>was this would be unacceptable for the</v>

3530
02:26:01.361 --> 02:26:05.680
<v Speaker 2>commercial profile of paroxetine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they just said that it did and that's</v>

3531
02:26:05.681 --> 02:26:06.700
<v Speaker 2>the fucking drug I was given.</v>

3532
02:26:06.700 --> 02:26:08.500
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's shocking to see the drug that you</v>

3533
02:26:08.501 --> 02:26:11.320
<v Speaker 2>were given the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this company involved.</v>

3534
02:26:11.321 --> 02:26:13.350
<v Speaker 2>So it didn't work for people like you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

3535
02:26:13.530 --> 02:26:14.363
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3536
02:26:14.550 --> 02:26:15.340
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

3537
02:26:15.340 --> 02:26:17.140
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when it had very powerful side effects</v>

3538
02:26:17.141 --> 02:26:18.820
<v Speaker 2>on me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I gained a huge amount of way.</v>

3539
02:26:18.821 --> 02:26:21.250
<v Speaker 2>It has all sorts of side effects.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3540
02:26:21.520 --> 02:26:23.140
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did it help you at all?</v>

3541
02:26:24.190 --> 02:26:28.270
<v Speaker 2>I thought a strong initial boost and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>would say it probably did give me 1.8</v>

3542
02:26:28.271 --> 02:26:31.000
<v Speaker 2>points on the Hamilton scale.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what we're talking about probably</v>

3543
02:26:31.001 --> 02:26:34.330
<v Speaker 2>gave me a very mild boost,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it didn't solve my problem.</v>

3544
02:26:34.660 --> 02:26:37.120
<v Speaker 2>And the problem is the story I was told</v>
<v Speaker 2>about it,</v>

3545
02:26:37.440 --> 02:26:41.140
<v Speaker 2>that this is the solution because the</v>
<v Speaker 2>problem is the chemical imbalance</v>

3546
02:26:41.440 --> 02:26:45.220
<v Speaker 2>disconnected me from a much wider</v>
<v Speaker 2>program of reconnection in my life that</v>

3547
02:26:45.221 --> 02:26:47.320
<v Speaker 2>did in fact solve my depression when I</v>
<v Speaker 2>embarked on it.</v>

3548
02:26:47.321 --> 02:26:48.154
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

3549
02:26:48.340 --> 02:26:51.180
<v Speaker 2>the so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I think the,</v>

3550
02:26:51.181 --> 02:26:55.630
<v Speaker 2>the drug companies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's scandalous what they did.</v>

3551
02:26:55.630 --> 02:26:57.280
<v Speaker 2>It's not that the drugs have no value,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they do,</v>

3552
02:26:57.580 --> 02:27:01.000
<v Speaker 2>but when you read through what they</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually did and the way the stories</v>

3553
02:27:01.001 --> 02:27:02.690
<v Speaker 2>were constructed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3554
02:27:02.700 --> 02:27:03.550
<v Speaker 2>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3555
02:27:03.551 --> 02:27:04.580
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3556
02:27:04.620 --> 02:27:08.290
<v Speaker 2>the</v>
<v Speaker 2>bullshit we were told,</v>

3557
02:27:08.710 --> 02:27:10.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I remember it just being a</v>

3558
02:27:10.151 --> 02:27:13.960
<v Speaker 2>clinical psychologist talk to Lucy</v>
<v Speaker 2>Johnson and he's a brilliant person and</v>

3559
02:27:13.961 --> 02:27:14.830
<v Speaker 2>her just saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3560
02:27:15.550 --> 02:27:18.970
<v Speaker 2>everything you were told is bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And me just sitting there and going</v>

3561
02:27:18.971 --> 02:27:20.080
<v Speaker 2>through this is what my daughter told</v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

3562
02:27:20.081 --> 02:27:21.260
<v Speaker 2>This is what my doctor told me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This isn't my daughter.</v>

3563
02:27:21.500 --> 02:27:23.680
<v Speaker 2>She's the fact that shit bullshit</v>
<v Speaker 2>cautions,</v>

3564
02:27:23.681 --> 02:27:26.200
<v Speaker 2>no legal repercussions against those</v>
<v Speaker 2>people for doing that.</v>

3565
02:27:26.201 --> 02:27:28.070
<v Speaker 2>It's just stunning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there was something about what</v>

3566
02:27:28.300 --> 02:27:32.680
<v Speaker 2>you think about like insider trading,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how devastating the penalties are for</v>

3567
02:27:32.681 --> 02:27:34.930
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is far worse.</v>

3568
02:27:35.200 --> 02:27:38.260
<v Speaker 2>One of the scandals is the um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the FDA,</v>

3569
02:27:38.261 --> 02:27:40.480
<v Speaker 2>how much of it is funded by the drug</v>
<v Speaker 2>companies itself?</v>

3570
02:27:40.570 --> 02:27:42.280
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>40% of the budget.</v>

3571
02:27:42.460 --> 02:27:44.770
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine if you had a ballgame where one</v>

3572
02:27:44.771 --> 02:27:48.820
<v Speaker 2>side was fun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where one of the teams paid the referees</v>

3573
02:27:48.821 --> 02:27:49.451
<v Speaker 2>wages.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3574
02:27:49.451 --> 02:27:51.490
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you'd find that gate that,</v>

3575
02:27:51.491 --> 02:27:53.380
<v Speaker 2>that that team would win a lot more</v>
<v Speaker 2>often.</v>

3576
02:27:53.400 --> 02:27:55.120
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what we think is,</v>

3577
02:27:55.390 --> 02:27:57.010
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this dispassionate judge,</v>

3578
02:27:57.040 --> 02:27:57.873
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and one of those scans.</v>

3579
02:27:57.880 --> 02:28:00.640
<v Speaker 2>Even the way the rules are constructed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So to get a drug,</v>

3580
02:28:00.810 --> 02:28:02.650
<v Speaker 2>and I think there would have been</v>
<v Speaker 2>slightly tightened recently,</v>

3581
02:28:02.651 --> 02:28:06.940
<v Speaker 2>but the t one entity presence were first</v>
<v Speaker 2>introduced to get a drug to market.</v>

3582
02:28:07.300 --> 02:28:11.920
<v Speaker 2>You only had to demonstrate to studies</v>
<v Speaker 2>anywhere that shows any efficacy.</v>

3583
02:28:11.921 --> 02:28:15.160
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that means you could commission 3000</v>

3584
02:28:15.161 --> 02:28:18.250
<v Speaker 2>studies and if two of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not that the FDA would take the</v>

3585
02:28:18.251 --> 02:28:21.730
<v Speaker 2>balance of the research,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you could show to that it works.</v>

3586
02:28:21.790 --> 02:28:24.050
<v Speaker 2>That's what they represent those studies</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the FDA.</v>

3587
02:28:24.050 --> 02:28:26.000
<v Speaker 2>They didn't have to show them everything</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've done.</v>

3588
02:28:26.001 --> 02:28:27.260
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's gotten a bit better now.</v>

3589
02:28:27.261 --> 02:28:30.170
<v Speaker 2>There's now more publication required,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is one of the reasons why so few</v>

3590
02:28:30.980 --> 02:28:33.710
<v Speaker 2>new chemical antidepressants are coming</v>
<v Speaker 2>onto the market because the rules have</v>

3591
02:28:33.711 --> 02:28:36.560
<v Speaker 2>been slightly tightened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as a result where all the new ones,</v>

3592
02:28:36.561 --> 02:28:37.570
<v Speaker 2>they're not coming on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3593
02:28:37.580 --> 02:28:38.331
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there are some,</v>

3594
02:28:38.331 --> 02:28:41.630
<v Speaker 2>but they're far more limited.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How has he shown also that rigorous</v>

3595
02:28:41.631 --> 02:28:44.360
<v Speaker 2>exercise is actually more effective in</v>
<v Speaker 2>treating depression than</v>

3596
02:28:44.361 --> 02:28:47.090
<v Speaker 2>antidepressants?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I was going a bit too far,</v>

3597
02:28:47.091 --> 02:28:49.280
<v Speaker 2>but there's evidence that while there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>very strong,</v>

3598
02:28:49.281 --> 02:28:50.660
<v Speaker 2>if it's taught to Isabelle banker who</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should,</v>

3599
02:28:50.690 --> 02:28:52.820
<v Speaker 2>you would love,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I should introduce you to her.</v>

3600
02:28:53.120 --> 02:28:54.880
<v Speaker 2>She's a primatologist Chilean</v>
<v Speaker 2>primatologist,</v>

3601
02:28:54.920 --> 02:28:56.910
<v Speaker 2>basically the best person in the world</v>
<v Speaker 2>as far as can said.</v>

3602
02:28:57.240 --> 02:29:00.290
<v Speaker 2>She's a hardcore chalea and she's</v>
<v Speaker 2>currently in some jungle somewhere</v>

3603
02:29:00.291 --> 02:29:01.730
<v Speaker 2>better than Mick Jagger's ex wife.</v>

3604
02:29:01.810 --> 02:29:02.590
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3605
02:29:02.590 --> 02:29:03.021
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3606
02:29:03.021 --> 02:29:05.720
<v Speaker 2>I like Marianne Faithfull,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Isabel as something else.</v>

3607
02:29:05.721 --> 02:29:07.490
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's about ultimately is my last</v>

3608
02:29:07.491 --> 02:29:08.330
<v Speaker 2>point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Isabelle,</v>

3609
02:29:08.540 --> 02:29:10.610
<v Speaker 2>so she's demonstrated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she showing loads of things.</v>

3610
02:29:10.611 --> 02:29:12.630
<v Speaker 2>One of the real interesting things is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3611
02:29:12.710 --> 02:29:15.950
<v Speaker 2>nature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so she's shown that exercise is a</v>

3612
02:29:15.951 --> 02:29:18.170
<v Speaker 2>massive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really powerful anti depressant.</v>

3613
02:29:18.171 --> 02:29:22.370
<v Speaker 2>But interestingly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exercise in nature is even more</v>

3614
02:29:22.371 --> 02:29:24.780
<v Speaker 2>effective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she's shown her theories.</v>

3615
02:29:24.890 --> 02:29:26.580
<v Speaker 2>And I really liked this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She,</v>

3616
02:29:26.810 --> 02:29:29.600
<v Speaker 2>she did a lot of work with Bonobos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both in zoos and in the wild.</v>

3617
02:29:29.960 --> 02:29:33.980
<v Speaker 2>And she's got really good stories about</v>
<v Speaker 2>how Benobos basically bond by lesbian</v>

3618
02:29:33.981 --> 02:29:35.030
<v Speaker 2>group sex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she,</v>

3619
02:29:35.240 --> 02:29:35.790
<v Speaker 2>she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she,</v>

3620
02:29:35.790 --> 02:29:38.780
<v Speaker 2>she's had a pioneer how they managed to</v>
<v Speaker 2>create vibrators when they're in the</v>

3621
02:29:38.781 --> 02:29:39.800
<v Speaker 2>zoo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an amazing story,</v>

3622
02:29:39.801 --> 02:29:41.280
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3623
02:29:41.950 --> 02:29:44.300
<v Speaker 2>like literally she would like get the</v>
<v Speaker 2>buckets and they would find a way to</v>

3624
02:29:44.301 --> 02:29:46.550
<v Speaker 2>turn it into a vibrator.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was more of them,</v>

3625
02:29:46.710 --> 02:29:47.490
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3626
02:29:47.490 --> 02:29:49.820
<v Speaker 2>And then have massive lesbian origins</v>
<v Speaker 2>with their vibrators,</v>

3627
02:29:50.570 --> 02:29:52.760
<v Speaker 2>British Zeus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's like polite British parents</v>

3628
02:29:52.761 --> 02:29:55.090
<v Speaker 2>would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's happening?</v>

3629
02:29:55.100 --> 02:29:56.990
<v Speaker 2>And they'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come over here.</v>

3630
02:29:57.200 --> 02:30:01.820
<v Speaker 2>But the is the most theories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So animals go crazy and zoos a lot of</v>

3631
02:30:01.821 --> 02:30:02.371
<v Speaker 2>the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3632
02:30:02.371 --> 02:30:06.320
<v Speaker 2>Carrots rip out their feathers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>horses start obsessively swaying.</v>

3633
02:30:07.140 --> 02:30:09.770
<v Speaker 2>Elephants will grind their tasks down to</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing.</v>

3634
02:30:10.190 --> 02:30:11.590
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3635
02:30:12.110 --> 02:30:14.130
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and she basically argues is [inaudible]</v>

3636
02:30:14.250 --> 02:30:15.440
<v Speaker 2>Bob,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is simplifying your argument.</v>

3637
02:30:15.441 --> 02:30:18.620
<v Speaker 2>She has as many things going on here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

3638
02:30:19.380 --> 02:30:20.110
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3639
02:30:20.110 --> 02:30:24.260
<v Speaker 2>the humans are being animals deprived of</v>
<v Speaker 2>their habitat feel like shit.</v>

3640
02:30:24.620 --> 02:30:26.750
<v Speaker 2>And we are increasingly deprived of our</v>
<v Speaker 2>habitat.</v>

3641
02:30:26.751 --> 02:30:28.220
<v Speaker 2>The habitat we evolved in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3642
02:30:28.520 --> 02:30:31.310
<v Speaker 2>There's lots of evidence that people who</v>
<v Speaker 2>live in areas with no green space,</v>

3643
02:30:31.311 --> 02:30:33.110
<v Speaker 2>I'm much more likely to become depressed</v>
<v Speaker 2>than people who don't.</v>

3644
02:30:33.290 --> 02:30:36.590
<v Speaker 2>And people who move from one area</v>
<v Speaker 2>without greenspace torn area,</v>

3645
02:30:36.600 --> 02:30:38.450
<v Speaker 2>we greenspace become much less</v>
<v Speaker 2>depressed,</v>

3646
02:30:38.451 --> 02:30:39.680
<v Speaker 2>rise loads of research on this.</v>

3647
02:30:39.880 --> 02:30:44.880
<v Speaker 2>There was actually an amazing study.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Michigan State Prison looks out by just</v>

3648
02:30:45.201 --> 02:30:46.550
<v Speaker 2>by accident,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one designed it this way.</v>

3649
02:30:46.551 --> 02:30:50.300
<v Speaker 2>One part of it looks out over just bare</v>
<v Speaker 2>concrete and one part of it looks out</v>

3650
02:30:50.301 --> 02:30:54.160
<v Speaker 2>over like lovely green space and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who when the,</v>

3651
02:30:54.170 --> 02:30:55.640
<v Speaker 2>there was just random where you ended</v>
<v Speaker 2>up,</v>

3652
02:30:55.940 --> 02:30:57.590
<v Speaker 2>but the people who looked out over the</v>
<v Speaker 2>concrete,</v>

3653
02:30:57.591 --> 02:31:00.200
<v Speaker 2>we're 23% more likely to develop mental</v>
<v Speaker 2>health problems,</v>

3654
02:31:00.260 --> 02:31:03.410
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this thing about as Isabel says,</v>

3655
02:31:03.411 --> 02:31:07.280
<v Speaker 2>we are animals that were designed to</v>
<v Speaker 2>move through nature.</v>

3656
02:31:07.580 --> 02:31:10.010
<v Speaker 2>If you are not an animal moving through</v>
<v Speaker 2>nature,</v>

3657
02:31:10.190 --> 02:31:13.310
<v Speaker 2>you are not a healthy human being.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You are not in your habitat,</v>

3658
02:31:13.580 --> 02:31:16.550
<v Speaker 2>you need to be in that habitat at least</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the time.</v>

3659
02:31:16.640 --> 02:31:18.530
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

3660
02:31:18.770 --> 02:31:19.110
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>asked that you should do.</v>

3662

<v Speaker 2>You should,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would love her anyway.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm sure she has both lesbian group sex</v>

3664
02:31:26.191 --> 02:31:30.000
<v Speaker 2>stories and stories about how you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>kill your depression with nature</v>

3665
02:31:30.001 --> 02:31:32.850
<v Speaker 2>exposures though y'all aren't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you very much in one more time.</v>
