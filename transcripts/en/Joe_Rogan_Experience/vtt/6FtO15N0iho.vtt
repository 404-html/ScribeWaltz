00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.950
<v Speaker 2>So what happened?</v>

15
00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:24.160
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

16
00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:24.993
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

17
00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.750
<v Speaker 1>this is the sixth roasts that I've written for the third one that I've been a</v>

18
00:00:28.751 --> 00:00:30.070
<v Speaker 1>staff writer on.</v>

19
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.820
<v Speaker 1>And it's always interesting when someone gets booked,</v>

20
00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:34.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

21
00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:35.261
<v Speaker 1>what's going to happen,</v>

22
00:00:35.261 --> 00:00:35.461
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

23
00:00:35.461 --> 00:00:35.690
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

24
00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.990
<v Speaker 1>blah.</v>

25
00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:40.990
<v Speaker 1>And Ann Coulter was one of the last bookings that we had and I was excited to</v>

26
00:00:41.111 --> 00:00:41.680
<v Speaker 1>help her.</v>

27
00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:42.760
<v Speaker 1>And she,</v>

28
00:00:42.761 --> 00:00:43.450
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

29
00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:44.283
<v Speaker 1>she didn't want,</v>

30
00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.830
<v Speaker 1>she didn't want to do anything that the writers told her,</v>

31
00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

32
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.800
<v Speaker 1>that she sorta had to do like to be funny.</v>

33
00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.873
<v Speaker 1>And she's like,</v>

34
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.680
<v Speaker 1>she didn't think anything was funny.</v>

35
00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.150
<v Speaker 1>So she rewrote everything.</v>

36
00:00:55.151 --> 00:00:58.540
<v Speaker 1>Like the script that we originally wrote anyway,</v>

37
00:00:58.541 --> 00:00:59.980
<v Speaker 1>she bombed really bad.</v>

38
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.930
<v Speaker 2>She bombed really bad.</v>

39
00:01:00.931 --> 00:01:02.100
<v Speaker 2>But what was she trying to avoid?</v>

40
00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:05.220
<v Speaker 2>Like when you said she didn't want to do what they wanted her to do?</v>

41
00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:05.901
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

42
00:01:05.901 --> 00:01:06.920
<v Speaker 1>we wanted her to write,</v>

43
00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:07.340
<v Speaker 1>we won.</v>

44
00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.200
<v Speaker 1>We had stuff in her voice,</v>

45
00:01:09.201 --> 00:01:12.800
<v Speaker 1>like with her angle and a little bit of self deprecating at the top.</v>

46
00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:13.641
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

47
00:01:13.641 --> 00:01:15.410
<v Speaker 1>Like it was supposed to be like,</v>

48
00:01:15.411 --> 00:01:15.711
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

49
00:01:15.711 --> 00:01:16.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm Ann Coulter.</v>

50
00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.600
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

51
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.600
<v Speaker 1>you might be wondering why I'm here at the Rob Lowe Roast.</v>

52
00:01:20.601 --> 00:01:24.620
<v Speaker 1>It's because it's the first time that I'm not the most hated person in the room.</v>

53
00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:25.071
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

54
00:01:25.071 --> 00:01:29.600
<v Speaker 1>like sorta like put it on her lender and you got to acknowledge who you are.</v>

55
00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:31.190
<v Speaker 1>But instead she's like,</v>

56
00:01:31.191 --> 00:01:31.701
<v Speaker 1>Nah,</v>

57
00:01:31.701 --> 00:01:32.331
<v Speaker 1>I don't like that.</v>

58
00:01:32.331 --> 00:01:32.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to,</v>

59
00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:34.100
<v Speaker 1>not going to play.</v>

60
00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:35.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to sell from,</v>

61
00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.020
<v Speaker 1>am I going to shit on myself as sub rose?</v>

62
00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.930
<v Speaker 1>Why would I do that?</v>

63
00:01:38.931 --> 00:01:39.260
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

64
00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.420
<v Speaker 1>There's no way there's no,</v>

65
00:01:41.421 --> 00:01:41.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's,</v>

66
00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:42.980
<v Speaker 1>those were her exact words,</v>

67
00:01:42.981 --> 00:01:45.680
<v Speaker 1>but she just said she wasn't going to do that and she would just cut out.</v>

68
00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:46.100
<v Speaker 1>You Go,</v>

69
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.600
<v Speaker 1>you go back and forth via emails and then all of a sudden all the good stuff is</v>

70
00:01:50.601 --> 00:01:53.450
<v Speaker 1>cut out and there's bad stuff and some of the stuff's rewritten.</v>

71
00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:54.740
<v Speaker 2>Did you meet her in real life?</v>

72
00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:55.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

73
00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.430
<v Speaker 2>Did you meet her in real life before the actual roast or the day of?</v>

74
00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:58.791
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

75
00:01:58.791 --> 00:01:59.421
<v Speaker 1>the day of,</v>

76
00:01:59.421 --> 00:02:02.330
<v Speaker 1>I talked to her on the phone five days out,</v>

77
00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:04.360
<v Speaker 1>which she was okay on that.</v>

78
00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.810
<v Speaker 1>She's like laughing at the script,</v>

79
00:02:05.811 --> 00:02:07.250
<v Speaker 1>but then once it's an email,</v>

80
00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

81
00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:08.780
<v Speaker 1>she rewrote it and it was bad.</v>

82
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.140
<v Speaker 1>But you really think that she's less hated and Rob Lowe?</v>

83
00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.520
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

84
00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.881
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

85
00:02:13.881 --> 00:02:14.480
<v Speaker 1>not at all.</v>

86
00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:15.380
<v Speaker 1>Everyone looks rob Lowe,</v>

87
00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.100
<v Speaker 1>who was the most hated person in the room besides her was the joke about rob</v>

88
00:02:22.101 --> 00:02:22.550
<v Speaker 1>Lowe.</v>

89
00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:23.061
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

90
00:02:23.061 --> 00:02:24.350
<v Speaker 1>The choke is like,</v>

91
00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.711
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

92
00:02:24.711 --> 00:02:25.101
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

93
00:02:25.101 --> 00:02:27.380
<v Speaker 1>she's saying that she's hated.</v>

94
00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.080
<v Speaker 1>She's acknowledging exactly it.</v>

95
00:02:29.081 --> 00:02:30.980
<v Speaker 1>Then she's saying the Rob Lowe's hated.</v>

96
00:02:30.981 --> 00:02:31.814
<v Speaker 1>So it's a joke,</v>

97
00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:32.730
<v Speaker 1>but it's not really,</v>

98
00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.120
<v Speaker 1>that part doesn't need to be funny though.</v>

99
00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:40.180
<v Speaker 1>We just needed her to acknowledge that she's a piece of shit and she didn't want</v>

100
00:02:40.341 --> 00:02:41.090
<v Speaker 1>to do that.</v>

101
00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.060
<v Speaker 1>Instead she came out and literally it's like you might be wondering loyal I'm</v>

102
00:02:44.061 --> 00:02:47.900
<v Speaker 1>here or it couldn't possibly be to promote my new book.</v>

103
00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.930
<v Speaker 1>And she leans down all awkwardly and pulls out her shitty book in Trump.</v>

104
00:02:53.001 --> 00:02:55.220
<v Speaker 1>We trust he pluribus awesome.</v>

105
00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.851
<v Speaker 1>And she says,</v>

106
00:02:55.851 --> 00:02:56.320
<v Speaker 1>I like it</v>

107
00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.070

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.190

113
00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:01.390
<v Speaker 1>is in Trump.</v>

115
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:03.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.940

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.853
<v Speaker 1>Awesome.</v>

119
00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:07.720

120
00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:08.661

148
00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.230
<v Speaker 2>She bent over for the man who might</v>

149
00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:15.173
<v Speaker 1>be king.</v>

150
00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:16.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

151
00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:16.921
<v Speaker 1>she was.</v>

152
00:04:16.921 --> 00:04:18.750
<v Speaker 1>She know she wants to play that character,</v>

153
00:04:18.751 --> 00:04:21.630
<v Speaker 1>but well if he wins and she wrote a book like that,</v>

154
00:04:21.631 --> 00:04:22.650
<v Speaker 1>she's in deep,</v>

155
00:04:22.651 --> 00:04:22.951
<v Speaker 1>deep,</v>

156
00:04:22.951 --> 00:04:23.311
<v Speaker 1>deep,</v>

157
00:04:23.311 --> 00:04:23.641
<v Speaker 1>deep,</v>

158
00:04:23.641 --> 00:04:24.450
<v Speaker 1>deep.</v>

159
00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.810
<v Speaker 1>She be the one to defend him every time there's any sort of a public,</v>

160
00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

161
00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:30.300
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't like her by the way.</v>

162
00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:31.230
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't like her.</v>

163
00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:32.190
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't like to see in.</v>

164
00:04:32.191 --> 00:04:36.990
<v Speaker 1>One of the really funny things is that he changed his immigration policy,</v>

165
00:04:36.991 --> 00:04:40.380
<v Speaker 1>like tweak the tone of it the day before that book came out.</v>

166
00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:43.950
<v Speaker 1>And it's sorta like mess things up because,</v>

167
00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:45.001
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

168
00:04:45.001 --> 00:04:48.660
<v Speaker 1>because he's sorta like a office books like all about like,</v>

169
00:04:48.661 --> 00:04:48.871
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

170
00:04:48.871 --> 00:04:51.780
<v Speaker 1>don't let anybody in his zero immigration.</v>

171
00:04:51.781 --> 00:04:52.860
<v Speaker 1>And he was sorta just like,</v>

172
00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:53.641
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

173
00:04:53.641 --> 00:04:55.830
<v Speaker 1>he visited Mexico like outta nowhere.</v>

174
00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:58.440
<v Speaker 1>Like the day before her book came out and she's like,</v>

175
00:04:58.470 --> 00:04:58.940
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

176
00:04:58.940 --> 00:04:59.191
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

177
00:04:59.191 --> 00:05:02.280
<v Speaker 1>it just wasn't good press for back to Ann Coulter.</v>

178
00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

179
00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:03.900
<v Speaker 1>So silly bitch.</v>

180
00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:05.250
<v Speaker 1>So what does she try to do?</v>

181
00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:07.740
<v Speaker 1>She tries to write her own jokes then.</v>

182
00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:08.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

183
00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:09.450
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

184
00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:10.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

185
00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:13.860
<v Speaker 1>like I worked with Martha Stewart for the Bieber roast and she crushed it.</v>

186
00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:14.843
<v Speaker 1>Crushed it.</v>

187
00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:16.620
<v Speaker 1>First thing she said to me,</v>

188
00:05:16.621 --> 00:05:16.810
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

189
00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:18.360
<v Speaker 1>I want to kill as hard as I can.</v>

190
00:05:18.361 --> 00:05:20.160
<v Speaker 1>So Hook it up and I'm like,</v>

191
00:05:20.161 --> 00:05:21.330
<v Speaker 1>Stuart's done time.</v>

192
00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:22.530
<v Speaker 1>That's what I want you to do.</v>

193
00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:22.801
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

194
00:05:22.801 --> 00:05:23.760
<v Speaker 1>She's the best ever.</v>

195
00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:24.860
<v Speaker 2>She's been in the pokey.</v>

196
00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:26.030
<v Speaker 2>She understands shit.</v>

197
00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.600
<v Speaker 2>And at a level and Coulter where they're privileged lifestyle of white people</v>

198
00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:30.740
<v Speaker 2>everywhere she goes.</v>

199
00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:32.083
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

200
00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:35.840
<v Speaker 1>And so Ann Coulter basically says that,</v>

201
00:05:35.841 --> 00:05:36.141
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

202
00:05:36.141 --> 00:05:37.220
<v Speaker 1>she doesn't like this joke.</v>

203
00:05:37.221 --> 00:05:38.240
<v Speaker 1>She doesn't like that joke.</v>

204
00:05:38.241 --> 00:05:39.051
<v Speaker 1>She writes this,</v>

205
00:05:39.051 --> 00:05:40.850
<v Speaker 1>she puts a pitch for a book at the top.</v>

206
00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:42.560
<v Speaker 1>First off,</v>

207
00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:44.720
<v Speaker 1>she was like a third to last.</v>

208
00:05:44.721 --> 00:05:45.410
<v Speaker 1>She was second.</v>

209
00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:46.400
<v Speaker 1>So Rob Lowe,</v>

210
00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:47.271
<v Speaker 1>when Ann Coulter,</v>

211
00:05:47.271 --> 00:05:47.901
<v Speaker 1>Jeff Ross,</v>

212
00:05:47.901 --> 00:05:48.470
<v Speaker 1>Rob Lowe,</v>

213
00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:49.250
<v Speaker 1>and to show,</v>

214
00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:49.641
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

215
00:05:49.641 --> 00:05:52.100
<v Speaker 1>So all these people in before Ralph Machio,</v>

216
00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:53.211
<v Speaker 1>Nikki Glaser,</v>

217
00:05:53.211 --> 00:05:54.290
<v Speaker 1>Pete Davidson,</v>

218
00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:55.520
<v Speaker 1>Jimmy Carr,</v>

219
00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:56.260
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

220
00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:56.430
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

221
00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:56.581
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

222
00:05:56.581 --> 00:05:56.710
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

223
00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:56.831
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

224
00:05:56.831 --> 00:05:57.560
<v Speaker 1>blah.</v>

225
00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:58.393
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

226
00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:01.340
<v Speaker 1>and she got lit up and I mean big time,</v>

227
00:06:01.341 --> 00:06:02.330
<v Speaker 1>Peyton Manning,</v>

228
00:06:02.331 --> 00:06:02.930
<v Speaker 1>jewel,</v>

229
00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:03.800
<v Speaker 1>everybody,</v>

230
00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:05.810
<v Speaker 1>they'd hit everybody on the day as you know,</v>

231
00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:08.450
<v Speaker 1>cause you always make fun of everybody at a roast of course.</v>

232
00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:10.730
<v Speaker 1>And then you get the main target at the end of your thing.</v>

233
00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:13.220
<v Speaker 1>But when people went in on Ian Coulter,</v>

234
00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:14.540
<v Speaker 1>they went in hard,</v>

235
00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:17.700
<v Speaker 1>very hard like Jimmy Card,</v>

236
00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:18.471
<v Speaker 1>this one joke,</v>

237
00:06:18.471 --> 00:06:19.101
<v Speaker 1>which I loved,</v>

238
00:06:19.101 --> 00:06:20.900

241
00:06:25.701 --> 00:06:30.701
<v Speaker 1>but it was something like Ann Coulter was here and you ugly ratchet faced piece</v>

244
00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:33.800
<v Speaker 1>like something like that.</v>

245
00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:34.371
<v Speaker 1>Just like that.</v>

246
00:06:34.371 --> 00:06:35.810
<v Speaker 1>Five insulting words,</v>

00:06:38.661 --> 00:06:41.780
<v Speaker 1>you are one of the most insufferable human beings on the planet,</v>

251
00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:43.250
<v Speaker 1>but it's not too late.</v>

252
00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:44.480
<v Speaker 1>You can change,</v>

253
00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:46.340
<v Speaker 1>you could kill yourself.</v>

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:48.620

00:06:50.691 --> 00:06:52.640
<v Speaker 1>So she was great to have on the Deus.</v>

258
00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:53.563
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

259
00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.250
<v Speaker 1>She could have killed me.</v>

260
00:06:55.251 --> 00:06:56.420
<v Speaker 1>And Mike Lawrence,</v>

261
00:06:56.421 --> 00:06:58.910
<v Speaker 1>who's a huge pro wrestling fan and Sarah Tiana,</v>

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:01.160
<v Speaker 1>who's an old school pro wrestling fan,</v>

263
00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:02.690

266
00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:05.940
<v Speaker 1>she'll own it,</v>

267
00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:07.130
<v Speaker 1>it'll be great.</v>

268
00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:10.910
<v Speaker 1>We're all going to look like superstars because we were able to make Ann Coulter</v>

269
00:07:10.911 --> 00:07:11.744

<v Speaker 1>which is hilarious,</v>

295
00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:57.010
<v Speaker 1>is the reaction shots that they chose for her jokes like when she was on stage,</v>

00:08:00.651 --> 00:08:01.970
<v Speaker 1>Like it just cuts to just,</v>

299
00:08:01.971 --> 00:08:04.850
<v Speaker 1>people just started just studying.</v>

300
00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:05.130
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

301
00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:05.410

00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:07.930
<v Speaker 2>her bones in the safest,</v>

304
00:08:07.931 --> 00:08:09.100
<v Speaker 2>softest world,</v>

305
00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:12.820
<v Speaker 2>which is the world of like political commentary where there's five different</v>

306
00:08:12.821 --> 00:08:15.520
<v Speaker 2>people and everybody's shouting over everybody and you don't have to say</v>

307
00:08:15.521 --> 00:08:16.720
<v Speaker 2>anything that's really relevant.</v>

308
00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:16.931
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

309
00:08:16.931 --> 00:08:17.681
<v Speaker 2>And especially her,</v>

310
00:08:17.681 --> 00:08:18.970
<v Speaker 2>because she's just a button pusher.</v>

311
00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:20.171
<v Speaker 2>She's a white lady,</v>

312
00:08:20.171 --> 00:08:23.200
<v Speaker 2>button pusher and she gets up there and she says crazy things like if Canada</v>

313
00:08:23.201 --> 00:08:24.550
<v Speaker 2>doesn't like it will invade them.</v>

314
00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:25.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

315
00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:26.410
<v Speaker 2>She says stupid shit like that,</v>

316
00:08:26.411 --> 00:08:27.430
<v Speaker 2>that she doesn't even mean,</v>

317
00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:27.971
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

318
00:08:27.971 --> 00:08:29.050
<v Speaker 2>and like this is what she does.</v>

319
00:08:29.051 --> 00:08:32.790
<v Speaker 2>She pushes buttons and Bill Maher calls or his friend and they laugh together.</v>

320
00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:35.980
<v Speaker 2>Hahahahaha and she lives in the soft world.</v>

321
00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:41.020
<v Speaker 2>That world that she stepped into is not just one of the hardest worlds,</v>

322
00:08:41.410 --> 00:08:45.990
<v Speaker 2>but for a person like her to go on after someone like Jimmy Carr and get Kirra</v>

323
00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:50.740
<v Speaker 2>washed and then attempt to plug her book and all that Jazz.</v>

324
00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:56.110
<v Speaker 2>Like I bet she has no idea what the average person's perception her is because</v>

325
00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:57.990
<v Speaker 1>she's dealing with that bubble,</v>

326
00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:01.110
<v Speaker 1>that fucking talk show and two d c crazy idea.</v>

327
00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:01.310
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

328
00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:01.500
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

329
00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:05.310
<v Speaker 1>But that weird bubble where she's kind of legitimate in that bubble and you</v>

330
00:09:05.311 --> 00:09:05.551
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

331
00:09:05.551 --> 00:09:06.570
<v Speaker 1>she's the button pusher.</v>

332
00:09:06.571 --> 00:09:08.940
<v Speaker 1>I'll hear it was come crazy an yeah.</v>

333

<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

334
00:09:09.421 --> 00:09:10.560
<v Speaker 1>she thinks she's wacky.</v>

335
00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:12.000
<v Speaker 1>And another thing is,</v>

336
00:09:12.001 --> 00:09:12.181
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

337
00:09:12.181 --> 00:09:15.270
<v Speaker 1>one of the main things that are roast is when you get made fun of,</v>

338
00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:16.470
<v Speaker 1>you should laugh.</v>

339
00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:17.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

340
00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:19.620
<v Speaker 1>Cause it shows that you have a sense of humor.</v>

341
00:09:19.621 --> 00:09:20.610
<v Speaker 1>That's like the main thing.</v>

342
00:09:20.611 --> 00:09:21.830
<v Speaker 1>That's why Trump did it.</v>

343
00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:23.100
<v Speaker 1>Now he's could be president.</v>

344
00:09:23.101 --> 00:09:24.150
<v Speaker 1>Charlie Sheen did it.</v>

345
00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:26.730
<v Speaker 1>Pro Trump can be president because he did a roast.</v>

346
00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:27.753
<v Speaker 1>Hey</v>
