1
00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:00.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2
00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:07.030
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're live,</v>

3
00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:08.170
<v Speaker 1>sir.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

4
00:00:08.171 --> 00:00:09.850
<v Speaker 1>thank you very much for coming on and </v>
<v Speaker 1>really appreciate it.</v>

5
00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:12.500
<v Speaker 1>I've enjoyed your youtube video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say I've enjoyed I,</v>

6
00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:14.950
<v Speaker 1>I haven't enjoyed them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've been puzzled by them.</v>

7
00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:19.540
<v Speaker 1>Been puzzled by the subject and for </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who have no idea what's going on.</v>

8
00:00:19.541 --> 00:00:22.630
<v Speaker 1>Let's sort of unpack this for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Canada,</v>

9
00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.390
<v Speaker 1>Canada is very different than the United</v>
<v Speaker 1>States.</v>

10
00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:28.320
<v Speaker 1>I love Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a giant fan of Canada.</v>

11
00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:30.670
<v Speaker 1>There's one place I would live outside </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the US.</v>

12
00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:32.200
<v Speaker 1>100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would be Canada.</v>

13
00:00:32.201 --> 00:00:37.201
<v Speaker 1>I love it up there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the people are at least 20 </v>

14
00:00:37.201 --> 00:00:39.361
<v Speaker 1>percent more polite than America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you've got some weird shit going on </v>

15
00:00:39.361 --> 00:00:41.790
<v Speaker 1>up there and your king.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the,</v>

16
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.420
<v Speaker 1>what do you call him?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Prime Minister Trudeau.</v>

17
00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:46.090
<v Speaker 1>That fella to the Castro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Castro lover.</v>

18
00:00:46.091 --> 00:00:50.260
<v Speaker 1>I was just going to say that this </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking guy and people have been posting</v>

19
00:00:50.261 --> 00:00:55.261
<v Speaker 1>today all the atrocities that Castro </v>
<v Speaker 1>committed during this regime to sort of </v>

20
00:00:55.261 --> 00:00:57.900
<v Speaker 1>show how proposed firing squad deaths.</v>

21
00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.940
<v Speaker 1>Few thousand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about all the different people that </v>

22
00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:02.940
<v Speaker 1>they executed and then sold their blood </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the Viet Cong.</v>

23
00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.200
<v Speaker 1>That one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this wonderful,</v>

24
00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.860
<v Speaker 1>wonderful man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a wonderful man that,</v>

25
00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.870
<v Speaker 1>that fucking savage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

26
00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:16.910
<v Speaker 1>Trudeau in what he represents is I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>the good side of it,</v>

27
00:01:18.251 --> 00:01:20.470
<v Speaker 1>what he's trying to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the trying to make a kinder,</v>

28
00:01:20.471 --> 00:01:24.340
<v Speaker 1>more progressive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more inclusive country,</v>

29
00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.090
<v Speaker 1>but along the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they're doing is they're,</v>

30
00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:33.120
<v Speaker 1>they're promoting what you would call </v>
<v Speaker 1>online social justice warrior values and</v>

31
00:01:33.641 --> 00:01:38.641
<v Speaker 1>some of them are a little preposterous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are one of the very few academics </v>

32
00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.610
<v Speaker 1>who have fought against some of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas that are not just being promoted </v>

33
00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.790
<v Speaker 1>but are being enforced and enforced and </v>
<v Speaker 1>written into law.</v>

34
00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.120
<v Speaker 1>And one of them is about gender </v>
<v Speaker 1>pronouns.</v>

35
00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.770
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>w when would mean by gender pronouns is </v>

36
00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.721
<v Speaker 1>not just he and she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a whole slew of invented gender </v>

37
00:02:01.661 --> 00:02:06.661
<v Speaker 1>pronouns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gender pronouns that you're going to be </v>

38
00:02:06.661 --> 00:02:06.661
<v Speaker 1>compelled to use.</v>

39
00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're already compelled to use.</v>

40
00:02:08.831 --> 00:02:11.890
<v Speaker 1>And and likely in the states to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though people don't know it yet,</v>

41
00:02:11.891 --> 00:02:16.120
<v Speaker 1>certainly in New York and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>employment,</v>

42
00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.280
<v Speaker 1>a EOC has already ruled on that with </v>
<v Speaker 1>regards to businesses for theu ,</v>

43
00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.760
<v Speaker 1>s and businesses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I believe also landlords,</v>

44
00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.420
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

45
00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.160
<v Speaker 1>So if your landlord chooses to ms dot </v>
<v Speaker 1>gender you and not just mis-gender you,</v>

46
00:02:30.161 --> 00:02:32.640
<v Speaker 1>like if you're a transgender woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you used to be mad.</v>

47
00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.670
<v Speaker 1>Now you're a woman and they call you a </v>
<v Speaker 1>he.</v>

48
00:02:34.671 --> 00:02:37.270
<v Speaker 1>It's not just that like you're compelled</v>
<v Speaker 1>to use how many.</v>

49
00:02:37.271 --> 00:02:37.940
<v Speaker 1>What is the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are those,</v>

50
00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.460
<v Speaker 1>the number of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

51
00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:44.490
<v Speaker 1>while there there's no standard </v>
<v Speaker 1>nomenclature for the non gender or the </v>

52
00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.980
<v Speaker 1>further nonbinary types.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's many,</v>

53
00:02:44.981 --> 00:02:49.981
<v Speaker 1>many invented words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And which of those you're supposed to </v>

54
00:02:49.981 --> 00:02:53.341
<v Speaker 1>use is dependent entirely on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>subjective choice of the person that </v>

55
00:02:53.341 --> 00:02:53.341
<v Speaker 1>you're talking with.</v>

56
00:02:53.341 --> 00:02:57.540
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most people I believe out there </v>

57
00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.540
<v Speaker 1>listening are going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell are they talking about?</v>

58
00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.071
<v Speaker 1>Right now we're talking about as as 70 </v>
<v Speaker 1>plus invented gender pronouns,</v>

59
00:03:03.551 --> 00:03:08.551
<v Speaker 1>like Zi x above zero h I r a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 1>weird ones and this is for people that </v>

60
00:03:11.201 --> 00:03:14.080
<v Speaker 1>don't necessarily think they're a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He or a she,</v>

61
00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.420
<v Speaker 1>so they prefer these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On top of that,</v>

62
00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.140
<v Speaker 1>you have animal kin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which other kids,</v>

63
00:03:23.141 --> 00:03:26.140
<v Speaker 1>other kids himself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was the one I thought most abusing</v>

64
00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.860
<v Speaker 1>worm self.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's for the low self esteem.</v>

65
00:03:29.861 --> 00:03:34.861
<v Speaker 1>Other kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is people that truly believe that </v>

66
00:03:34.861 --> 00:03:39.151
<v Speaker 1>they are in the wrong body and that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>should have been born some form of </v>

67
00:03:39.371 --> 00:03:43.600
<v Speaker 1>animal and would like you to refer to </v>
<v Speaker 1>them as this animal.</v>

68
00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.180
<v Speaker 1>Your Elf or Elf or a fairy or a Pixie </v>
<v Speaker 1>Pixie.</v>

69
00:03:49.181 --> 00:03:52.150
<v Speaker 1>Ken.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't seen Pixie kid.</v>

70
00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:53.890
<v Speaker 1>That's a good one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just get on.</v>

71
00:03:53.891 --> 00:03:55.610
<v Speaker 1>Tumbler got to get onto.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

72
00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.250
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where it all goes down.</v>

73
00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm professor Peterson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the Hell's going on?</v>

74
00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:01.660
<v Speaker 1>What is this?</v>

75
00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:04.210
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's partly.</v>

76
00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:07.000
<v Speaker 2>It's partly a form of narcissism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

77
00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:08.780
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a.</v>

78
00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:12.630
<v Speaker 2>it's partly a consequence of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the re,</v>

79
00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.570
<v Speaker 2>of the rise of the new rise again of of </v>
<v Speaker 2>say Marxist doctrine.</v>

80
00:04:16.571 --> 00:04:21.571
<v Speaker 2>I would say it's part of postmodernism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's postmodernism more than </v>

81
00:04:21.571 --> 00:04:23.650
<v Speaker 2>anything else because the postmodernists</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a philosophical.</v>

82
00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:25.660
<v Speaker 2>A community,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

83
00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:31.110
<v Speaker 2>believed that the entire point of human </v>
<v Speaker 2>categorization is power and that </v>

84
00:04:31.741 --> 00:04:36.741
<v Speaker 2>dialogue between people is only a power </v>
<v Speaker 2>dialogue and that there's no real </v>

85
00:04:37.841 --> 00:04:42.841
<v Speaker 2>reality outside of interpretation and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that basically what we do is exchange </v>

86
00:04:42.841 --> 00:04:46.720
<v Speaker 2>interpretive viewpoints to ratchet up </v>
<v Speaker 2>our dominance and status and that's that</v>

87
00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:51.780
<v Speaker 2>and there's no biology as an ideology </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the idea of the objective world is </v>

88
00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:56.461
<v Speaker 2>an ideology and sciences and ideology </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's all interpretation all the way </v>

89
00:04:56.461 --> 00:04:57.280
<v Speaker 2>down like turtles all the way down.</v>

90
00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:02.820
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean by it's all about </v>

91
00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:02.820
<v Speaker 1>power?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like in what way?</v>

92
00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:02.890
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine that,</v>

93
00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:08.120
<v Speaker 2>that there are groups of people who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>competing in the world for resources I </v>

94
00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:12.501
<v Speaker 2>suppose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that it's a zero sum game and it's </v>

95
00:05:12.501 --> 00:05:17.480
<v Speaker 2>every group against every other group </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the reason that we engage in </v>

96
00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.320
<v Speaker 2>dialogue isn't to establish the truth or</v>
<v Speaker 2>move towards some,</v>

97
00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:24.350
<v Speaker 2>some closer approximation of reality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to structure this social interaction</v>

98
00:05:25.411 --> 00:05:27.150
<v Speaker 2>so that our group comes up on top.</v>

99
00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:29.320
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that it.</v>

100
00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:34.370
<v Speaker 1>That is really what the problem is with </v>
<v Speaker 1>all this is that it's not just a matter </v>

101
00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:38.561
<v Speaker 1>of choosing to be defined in one way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but compelling others to define you in </v>

102
00:05:38.841 --> 00:05:39.290
<v Speaker 1>that way.</v>

103
00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:42.990
<v Speaker 2>The most,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most awful elements of it I think is the</v>

104
00:05:42.991 --> 00:05:46.710
<v Speaker 2>idea that individuals should be defined </v>
<v Speaker 2>in terms of their group identity at all.</v>

105
00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:52.130
<v Speaker 2>I mean you could argue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is one of these weird </v>

106
00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:54.240
<v Speaker 2>inversions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so characteristic of this chaotic state </v>

107
00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.991
<v Speaker 2>that we're in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When people originally started fighting </v>

108
00:05:56.991 --> 00:05:58.160
<v Speaker 2>against unfair discrimination and and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>say unfair</v>

109
00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.800
<v Speaker 3>discrimination because lots of </v>
<v Speaker 3>discrimination is fair.</v>

110
00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:04.610
<v Speaker 3>If you discriminate against people on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the basis of their competence,</v>

111
00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:09.910
<v Speaker 3>that's perfectly reasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's unfair discrimination that that </v>

112
00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:14.230
<v Speaker 3>constitutes the proper battleground for </v>
<v Speaker 3>people who have a more egalitarian </v>

113
00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:17.771
<v Speaker 3>viewpoint,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the initial idea was to eliminate </v>

114
00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:22.870
<v Speaker 3>the proclivity for people to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>categorized according to their group </v>

115
00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:25.871
<v Speaker 3>identity because that was interfering </v>
<v Speaker 3>with everyone's ability to view them as </v>

116
00:06:25.871 --> 00:06:29.710
<v Speaker 3>as competent individuals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that got flipped probably in the </v>

117
00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:33.940
<v Speaker 3>seventies after the Soviet state.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So self evidently was revealed as a </v>

118
00:06:34.101 --> 00:06:39.101
<v Speaker 3>catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That that got flipped so that the world </v>

119
00:06:39.101 --> 00:06:42.491
<v Speaker 3>was turned into one group against </v>
<v Speaker 3>another power struggle from one group </v>

120
00:06:42.491 --> 00:06:47.351
<v Speaker 3>against another,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then the social justice warrior </v>

121
00:06:47.351 --> 00:06:49.871
<v Speaker 3>types in the lefties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even the Democratic Party started </v>

122
00:06:49.871 --> 00:06:52.601
<v Speaker 3>categorizing everybody according to </v>
<v Speaker 3>their ethnic or sexual or racial </v>

123
00:06:52.601 --> 00:06:56.111
<v Speaker 3>identity and made that the canonical </v>
<v Speaker 3>element of their being and that's an </v>

124
00:06:56.111 --> 00:06:57.160
<v Speaker 3>absolutely terrible thing to do it.</v>

125
00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:59.390
<v Speaker 3>It leads to in the Soviet Union.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When that happened,</v>

126
00:06:59.391 --> 00:07:04.391
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they introduced that idea along </v>

127
00:07:04.391 --> 00:07:05.990
<v Speaker 3>with the notion of class guilt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So for example,</v>

128
00:07:05.991 --> 00:07:10.991
<v Speaker 3>when the Soviets collectivize the farms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they pretty much wiped out or or raped </v>

129
00:07:11.151 --> 00:07:13.430
<v Speaker 3>and froze to death.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All of their.</v>

130
00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:16.120
<v Speaker 3>All of their competent farmers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they.</v>

131
00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:21.220
<v Speaker 3>They called them Kulaks and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>attributed class guilt to them because </v>

132
00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:25.991
<v Speaker 3>they were successful peasants and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>define their success as oppression and </v>

133
00:07:25.991 --> 00:07:27.620
<v Speaker 3>theft.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They killed all of them,</v>

134
00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:32.680
<v Speaker 3>pretty much ship them off to Siberia and</v>
<v Speaker 3>frozen to death and they were the </v>

135
00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:34.280
<v Speaker 3>productive agriculturalists in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Soviet Union.</v>

136
00:07:34.281 --> 00:07:36.710
<v Speaker 3>And then in the 19 thirties in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Ukraine because of that,</v>

137
00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:38.750
<v Speaker 3>about 6 million Ukrainian starved to </v>
<v Speaker 3>death,</v>

138
00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:41.570
<v Speaker 3>but the Soviets were big on collective </v>
<v Speaker 3>guilt.</v>

139
00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:43.700
<v Speaker 3>And all of these things that you hear </v>
<v Speaker 3>about now,</v>

140
00:07:43.701 --> 00:07:48.020
<v Speaker 3>like white privilege for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're there are variants of collective</v>

141
00:07:48.021 --> 00:07:48.590
<v Speaker 3>guilt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

142
00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:51.080
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I pick your bloody identity,</v>

143
00:07:51.081 --> 00:07:56.081
<v Speaker 3>whatever it happens to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then I make you a guilty member of </v>

144
00:07:56.081 --> 00:07:59.591
<v Speaker 3>that category and then you and the rest </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the guilty members of that category </v>

145
00:07:59.591 --> 00:08:00.020
<v Speaker 3>are judged as a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a unit.</v>

146
00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:04.580
<v Speaker 3>It's absolutely it's murderous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pushed to its extreme,</v>

147
00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:06.170
<v Speaker 3>and we've seen that many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many times.</v>

148
00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:07.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're oppressed or your,</v>

149
00:08:07.971 --> 00:08:12.971
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your opinions rather a suppressed and </v>

150
00:08:12.971 --> 00:08:15.671
<v Speaker 1>you are automatically put into this </v>
<v Speaker 1>category of people who should be </v>

151
00:08:15.671 --> 00:08:16.850
<v Speaker 1>dismissed because of the fact that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have white privilege.</v>

152
00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:19.250
<v Speaker 1>You should step back and let others </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk.</v>

153
00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:24.520
<v Speaker 1>You should step back and this is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>narrative that gets repeated over and </v>

154
00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:24.530
<v Speaker 1>over again in a social justice warrior </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>

155
00:08:24.531 --> 00:08:29.531
<v Speaker 1>This idea that you should just step back</v>
<v Speaker 1>and let these others talk because they </v>

156
00:08:29.531 --> 00:08:29.531
<v Speaker 1>understand as long.</v>

157
00:08:29.531 --> 00:08:34.510
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the others are always other group </v>

158
00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:34.510
<v Speaker 3>members,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

159
00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:37.900
<v Speaker 3>And somehow their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their discourses to be privileged in </v>

160
00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:40.190
<v Speaker 3>reverse because hypothetically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're a member of an oppressed class.</v>

161
00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:45.480
<v Speaker 3>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you can multiply the numbers of </v>

162
00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:45.480
<v Speaker 3>oppressed</v>

163
00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:46.390
<v Speaker 1>classes ad Nauseum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is another part of the problem.</v>

164
00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:51.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like the idea is that in giving them </v>

165
00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:51.690
<v Speaker 1>privileged because they have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>marginalized,</v>

166
00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:54.550
<v Speaker 1>you will balance things out and you will</v>
<v Speaker 1>somehow another reverse the scale.</v>

167
00:08:54.551 --> 00:08:56.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's another example</v>

168
00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:58.260
<v Speaker 3>of the class based guilt idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

169
00:08:58.261 --> 00:09:03.261
<v Speaker 3>it's um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't seem to me self evident that </v>

170
00:09:03.261 --> 00:09:04.440
<v Speaker 3>I'm to blame for slavery for example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

171
00:09:04.441 --> 00:09:09.441
<v Speaker 3>being a Canadian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a slightly different situation I </v>

172
00:09:09.441 --> 00:09:09.441
<v Speaker 3>suppose,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the,</v>

173
00:09:09.441 --> 00:09:11.190
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea that as the member,</v>

174
00:09:11.191 --> 00:09:16.191
<v Speaker 3>as a member of a culture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you're somehow responsible for the </v>

175
00:09:16.191 --> 00:09:17.710
<v Speaker 3>past sins of that culture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's say it,</v>

176
00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:19.200
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a very,</v>

177
00:09:19.201 --> 00:09:24.201
<v Speaker 3>very anti western ethos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It goes along with this idea of class </v>

178
00:09:24.201 --> 00:09:25.920
<v Speaker 3>guilt because your group membership is </v>
<v Speaker 3>the most important thing.</v>

179
00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:29.550
<v Speaker 3>If your group at some point in the past </v>
<v Speaker 3>did something reprehensible,</v>

180
00:09:29.551 --> 00:09:32.130
<v Speaker 3>which of course every group has done,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's for sure.</v>

181
00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:36.090
<v Speaker 3>Then you are de facto responsible in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>present for that.</v>

182
00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:41.540
<v Speaker 3>How do you think we got to this point </v>
<v Speaker 3>where people are repeating these </v>

183
00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:44.790
<v Speaker 3>patterns that were ultimately incredibly</v>
<v Speaker 3>unsuccessful and dangerous and deadly in</v>

184
00:09:44.791 --> 00:09:45.390
<v Speaker 3>the past?</v>

185
00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:50.390
<v Speaker 3>Like Marxism for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like people proudly proclaim themselves </v>

186
00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:52.370
<v Speaker 3>as having Marxist ideology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one in five,</v>

187
00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:55.390
<v Speaker 3>one in five social scientists claimed to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be a Marxist,</v>

188
00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:59.610
<v Speaker 3>kind of understand the history.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why don't you fill people in on how that</v>

189
00:09:59.611 --> 00:10:01.350
<v Speaker 3>went bad?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

190
00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:04.830
<v Speaker 3>the estimates vary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in the Soviet Union between 19,</v>

191
00:10:04.831 --> 00:10:09.831
<v Speaker 3>19 in 1959,</v>
<v Speaker 3>somewhere between 30 and 50 million </v>

192
00:10:09.831 --> 00:10:11.040
<v Speaker 3>people were killed in internal </v>
<v Speaker 3>oppression alone.</v>

193
00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:13.200
<v Speaker 3>So that's pretty bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>

194
00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:14.490
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and in China,</v>

195
00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:19.580
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was operating under exactly the </v>

196
00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:20.160
<v Speaker 3>same principles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>might have been up to 100 million killed</v>

197
00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:25.430
<v Speaker 3>during Mao's time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And of course my was still revered in </v>

198
00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:25.440
<v Speaker 3>China appallingly enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

199
00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:31.040
<v Speaker 3>and Vietnam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Vietnam and Cambodia and wherever these </v>

200
00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:31.260
<v Speaker 3>ideas were implemented,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cuba,</v>

201
00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:35.340
<v Speaker 3>wherever these ideas were implemented,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the result was absolute mayhem,</v>

202
00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:40.370
<v Speaker 3>absolute mayhem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think what happened is that the </v>

203
00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:43.611
<v Speaker 3>Marxist ideas are actually quite </v>
<v Speaker 3>attractive if you're an intel </v>

204
00:10:43.611 --> 00:10:43.611
<v Speaker 3>electrical.</v>

205
00:10:43.611 --> 00:10:44.490
<v Speaker 3>And if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say,</v>

206
00:10:44.491 --> 00:10:47.640
<v Speaker 3>if you're tilted towards compassion from</v>
<v Speaker 3>a personality perspective,</v>

207
00:10:47.641 --> 00:10:49.950
<v Speaker 3>because they're based on doctrines like </v>
<v Speaker 3>from,</v>

208
00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:55.340
<v Speaker 3>from each,</v>
<v Speaker 3>according to his ability to each </v>

209
00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:57.351
<v Speaker 3>according to his need and the idea that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you should fulfill people's needs or </v>

210
00:10:57.351 --> 00:10:58.440
<v Speaker 3>that society should fulfill people's </v>
<v Speaker 3>needs,</v>

211
00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:01.320
<v Speaker 3>is on the surface of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and attractive idea.</v>

212
00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:06.620
<v Speaker 3>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the problem is who gets to define the </v>

213
00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:08.511
<v Speaker 3>needs and who gets to define the </v>
<v Speaker 3>abilities and that really is a big </v>

214
00:11:08.511 --> 00:11:11.811
<v Speaker 3>problem and well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then those ideas were put into </v>

215
00:11:11.821 --> 00:11:16.320
<v Speaker 3>practice a first in the Soviet Union.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Alexander Solzhenitsyn who wrote the</v>

216
00:11:16.321 --> 00:11:20.970
<v Speaker 3>Gulag archipelago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did a very lovely job of detailing,</v>

217
00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:21.610
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

218
00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:26.620
<v Speaker 3>in horrifying detail how those initial </v>
<v Speaker 3>doctrines were transformed into </v>

219
00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:30.171
<v Speaker 3>legislation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then how those legislation was </v>

220
00:11:30.171 --> 00:11:32.421
<v Speaker 3>transformed into endless genocide </v>
<v Speaker 3>essentially and almost destroyed the </v>

221
00:11:32.421 --> 00:11:36.801
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's not forget that I'm partly with </v>

222
00:11:36.801 --> 00:11:39.951
<v Speaker 3>the W,</v>
<v Speaker 3>partly with the help of Castro who just </v>

223
00:11:39.951 --> 00:11:39.951
<v Speaker 3>died.</v>

224
00:11:39.951 --> 00:11:39.951
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

225
00:11:39.951 --> 00:11:41.250
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the doctrines when,</v>

226
00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:43.440
<v Speaker 3>when put into practice in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>into,</v>

227
00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:46.830
<v Speaker 3>into actual practice were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>were murdered us instantaneously.</v>

228
00:11:46.831 --> 00:11:51.831
<v Speaker 3>Now what happened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're always apologists for the left </v>

229
00:11:51.831 --> 00:11:52.560
<v Speaker 3>in the West,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially in France,</v>

230
00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:54.220
<v Speaker 3>especially among the French </v>
<v Speaker 3>intellectuals,</v>

231
00:11:54.221 --> 00:11:57.550
<v Speaker 3>especially in the late 19 sixties and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then when,</v>

232
00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:03.060
<v Speaker 3>when all of the information about what </v>
<v Speaker 3>was happening is in the Soviet Union </v>

233
00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:05.200
<v Speaker 3>came flooding forward and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>culminated say in 19,</v>

234
00:12:05.390 --> 00:12:06.460
<v Speaker 3>19,</v>
<v Speaker 3>73 wouldn't.</v>

235
00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:11.480
<v Speaker 3>Soldier Netter's book was published.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The French intellectuals changed their </v>

236
00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:12.880
<v Speaker 3>tune instead of agitating on a part of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the working class,</v>

237
00:12:12.881 --> 00:12:16.220
<v Speaker 3>which was which allied them with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>murderous marxists.</v>

238
00:12:16.221 --> 00:12:21.220
<v Speaker 3>They switched and started talking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>power and to talk about group identity.</v>

239
00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:26.280
<v Speaker 3>It was like a sleight of hand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The underlying pathological philosophy </v>

240
00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:29.350
<v Speaker 3>remained exactly the same,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the surface nomenclature changed and</v>

241
00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:34.380
<v Speaker 3>that became very attractive and it at </v>
<v Speaker 3>the same time the Soviet Union </v>

242
00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:37.501
<v Speaker 3>dissolved.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so one of the problems I think we </v>

243
00:12:37.501 --> 00:12:39.721
<v Speaker 3>have now a perverse problem is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>these Marxist ideas are very attractive </v>

244
00:12:39.721 --> 00:12:42.310
<v Speaker 3>to compassionate intellectuals and we </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't have good,</v>

245
00:12:42.311 --> 00:12:44.710
<v Speaker 3>bad examples like the Soviet Union </v>
<v Speaker 3>around that.</v>

246
00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:46.090
<v Speaker 3>Everybody can point to and go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

247
00:12:46.091 --> 00:12:47.170
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that sounds good,</v>

248
00:12:47.171 --> 00:12:52.171
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what about the murderous death camps in </v>

249
00:12:52.171 --> 00:12:52.171
<v Speaker 3>the millions of people who are </v>
<v Speaker 3>suffering.</v>

250
00:12:52.171 --> 00:12:53.500
<v Speaker 3>We still have North Korea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

251
00:12:53.501 --> 00:12:57.160
<v Speaker 3>people treat North Korea like it's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>joke instead of like it's an exemplar of</v>

252
00:12:57.161 --> 00:13:02.161
<v Speaker 3>a pathological system and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and people have no historical memory </v>

253
00:13:02.161 --> 00:13:06.181
<v Speaker 3>like my students and that's partly </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they're taught so badly in </v>

254
00:13:06.181 --> 00:13:07.870
<v Speaker 3>schools is they have no idea what </v>
<v Speaker 3>happened in the Soviet Union.</v>

255
00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:13.220
<v Speaker 3>They have absolutely no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They know a little bit about the Second </v>

256
00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:15.190
<v Speaker 3>World War maybe and of course people </v>
<v Speaker 3>generally know about the Holocaust,</v>

257
00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:18.190
<v Speaker 3>but they have no idea what happened in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Soviet Union.</v>

258
00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:20.290
<v Speaker 3>So they have no idea where these ideas </v>
<v Speaker 3>could lead.</v>

259
00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:21.210
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the,</v>

260
00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:26.430
<v Speaker 3>and the universities and the high </v>
<v Speaker 3>schools are so full of people who are </v>

261
00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:28.030
<v Speaker 3>radically left leaning that they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>never taught any,</v>

262
00:13:28.031 --> 00:13:29.980
<v Speaker 3>that students are never taught any </v>
<v Speaker 3>proper history.</v>

263
00:13:30.010 --> 00:13:35.010
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're taught about the evils of </v>

264
00:13:35.010 --> 00:13:35.010
<v Speaker 3>capitalism and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's not like.</v>

265
00:13:35.010 --> 00:13:39.960
<v Speaker 3>It's not like any system is perfect,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's difference between imperfect</v>

266
00:13:40.811 --> 00:13:45.811
<v Speaker 3>and and consciously murderous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think one of the things that you've </v>

267
00:13:45.811 --> 00:13:50.241
<v Speaker 3>just said that's very important is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's attractive to compassionate </v>

268
00:13:50.241 --> 00:13:54.421
<v Speaker 3>intellectuals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People that without really looking at </v>

269
00:13:54.421 --> 00:13:58.981
<v Speaker 3>what the potential for these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the these laws and regulations with the </v>

270
00:13:59.591 --> 00:14:04.591
<v Speaker 3>negative potential for them is that the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the underlying inclination to lean </v>

271
00:14:06.791 --> 00:14:08.560
<v Speaker 3>towards that is that you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

272
00:14:08.590 --> 00:14:12.680
<v Speaker 3>you care about people and then you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want people to be okay and yeah,</v>

273
00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:15.590
<v Speaker 3>when you're kind of treating them like </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're your children's and,</v>

274
00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:19.330
<v Speaker 3>and I don't mean that in an entirely </v>
<v Speaker 3>sarcastic manner.</v>

275
00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:25.090
<v Speaker 3>It's reasonable in some sense to treat </v>
<v Speaker 3>other people like people that you love.</v>

276
00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:27.790
<v Speaker 3>Although it's not reasonable and in very</v>
<v Speaker 3>many other ways,</v>

277
00:14:27.791 --> 00:14:32.791
<v Speaker 3>which is why you don't invite every </v>
<v Speaker 3>stranger on the street to come and live </v>

278
00:14:32.791 --> 00:14:32.791
<v Speaker 3>with you in your house.</v>

279
00:14:32.791 --> 00:14:34.480
<v Speaker 3>I mean everybody puts up boundaries and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to do that,</v>

280
00:14:35.050 --> 00:14:40.050
<v Speaker 3>but.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And people tend more than than we ever </v>

281
00:14:40.050 --> 00:14:44.101
<v Speaker 3>expected.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I've done a lot of research in my </v>

282
00:14:44.101 --> 00:14:46.330
<v Speaker 3>lab that people do tend to vote and </v>
<v Speaker 3>think their temperament a lot more than,</v>

283
00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:48.660
<v Speaker 3>than anyone really realizes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

284
00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:51.680
<v Speaker 3>and if you're kind and that's your </v>
<v Speaker 3>highest virtue,</v>

285
00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:57.190
<v Speaker 3>then you tend to treat people like </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're kin because that's what kind </v>

286
00:14:57.190 --> 00:14:57.190
<v Speaker 3>means,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

287
00:14:57.190 --> 00:15:01.151
<v Speaker 3>It said an extension of the word kin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that doesn't work well in larger </v>

288
00:15:01.151 --> 00:15:05.021
<v Speaker 3>groups.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You need other principals and so you </v>

289
00:15:05.021 --> 00:15:05.021
<v Speaker 3>look at something like the idea of of </v>
<v Speaker 3>equity,</v>

290
00:15:05.021 --> 00:15:08.090
<v Speaker 3>which is equality of outcome rather than</v>
<v Speaker 3>equality of opportunity.</v>

291
00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:10.640
<v Speaker 3>On the surface of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it seems perfectly reasonable to say,</v>

292
00:15:10.641 --> 00:15:15.641
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if every resource isn't distributed </v>

293
00:15:15.641 --> 00:15:18.400
<v Speaker 3>absolutely equally to every group,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then the system is unfair and on the </v>

294
00:15:18.411 --> 00:15:20.630
<v Speaker 3>face of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a reasonable proposition,</v>

295
00:15:20.631 --> 00:15:23.270
<v Speaker 3>but it falls apart under minimal </v>
<v Speaker 3>examination.</v>

296
00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:25.580
<v Speaker 3>So here's something to think about for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for all,</v>

297
00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:28.670
<v Speaker 3>for everyone who thinks that equality of</v>
<v Speaker 3>outcome is a good idea,</v>

298
00:15:28.671 --> 00:15:31.370
<v Speaker 3>it's like why the hell are you striving </v>
<v Speaker 3>for anything?</v>

299
00:15:31.371 --> 00:15:36.371
<v Speaker 3>Then?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because the reason anyone strives to </v>

300
00:15:36.371 --> 00:15:40.901
<v Speaker 3>better themselves or to develop a skill </v>
<v Speaker 3>or to move forward in life at all is to </v>

301
00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:46.180
<v Speaker 3>produce inequality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're trying to rise above the mediocre</v>

302
00:15:46.221 --> 00:15:49.070
<v Speaker 3>masses every time you make an effort at </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything.</v>

303
00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:54.460
<v Speaker 3>And so everything that we associate a </v>
<v Speaker 3>positive movement forward to a positive </v>

304
00:15:56.211 --> 00:15:59.660
<v Speaker 3>motivation is actually an attempt to </v>
<v Speaker 3>render the world more on equal.</v>

305
00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:02.930
<v Speaker 3>Now you're rendering and on we equal in </v>
<v Speaker 3>adjust way,</v>

306
00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:04.730
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because we might say,</v>

307
00:16:04.731 --> 00:16:05.870
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you work really hard,</v>

308
00:16:05.871 --> 00:16:08.570
<v Speaker 3>you deserve and unequal outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well yeah,</v>

309
00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:11.090
<v Speaker 3>unless you want people to stop working </v>
<v Speaker 3>hard.</v>

310
00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:13.340
<v Speaker 3>And that was the old joke in the Soviet </v>
<v Speaker 3>Union,</v>

311
00:16:13.341 --> 00:16:15.770
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they pretend to pay us,</v>

312
00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:17.780
<v Speaker 3>we pretend to work.</v>

313
00:16:19.630 --> 00:16:21.720
<v Speaker 4>So it's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's,</v>

314
00:16:21.721 --> 00:16:24.010
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's so thoughtless that that's,</v>

315
00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:26.880
<v Speaker 4>that's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is a big problem.</v>

316
00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:30.700
<v Speaker 4>The phrase income inequality,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you never hear effort inequality?</v>

317
00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:32.290
<v Speaker 4>Because the effort,</v>

318
00:16:32.850 --> 00:16:33.590
<v Speaker 3>oh well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

319
00:16:33.591 --> 00:16:33.980
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

320
00:16:33.981 --> 00:16:36.710
<v Speaker 3>in some on some campuses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is true in California,</v>

321
00:16:37.130 --> 00:16:39.740
<v Speaker 3>it's now considered a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a form of aggression.</v>

322
00:16:40.070 --> 00:16:44.360
<v Speaker 3>It's classified under the </v>
<v Speaker 3>microaggression to say that hard work is</v>

323
00:16:44.361 --> 00:16:49.361
<v Speaker 3>the one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the reasons that people </v>

324
00:16:49.361 --> 00:16:49.930
<v Speaker 3>accumulate more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>accumulate more,</v>

325
00:16:49.931 --> 00:16:51.970
<v Speaker 3>accumulate more value,</v>
<v Speaker 3>accumulate more property,</v>

326
00:16:51.971 --> 00:16:53.590
<v Speaker 3>accumulate more money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

327
00:16:53.591 --> 00:16:54.850
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an aggression.</v>

328
00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:59.880
<v Speaker 3>It's aggressive to say that because it </v>
<v Speaker 3>implies that people who who are poor </v>

329
00:16:59.880 --> 00:16:59.880
<v Speaker 3>don't work hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

330
00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:04.920
<v Speaker 3>see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's another terribly fuzzy form of </v>

331
00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:06.340
<v Speaker 3>thinking because there are lots of </v>
<v Speaker 3>reasons for people to not have money,</v>

332
00:17:06.610 --> 00:17:09.130
<v Speaker 3>many to be poor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>

333
00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:14.160
<v Speaker 3>which is even,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is even different than not having </v>

334
00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:14.160
<v Speaker 3>money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>alcoholism,</v>

335
00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:15.760
<v Speaker 3>drug addiction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mental illness,</v>

336
00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:21.060
<v Speaker 3>physical illness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>intellectual incapacity and lack of </v>

337
00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:22.420
<v Speaker 3>work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of those things,</v>

338
00:17:22.860 --> 00:17:25.800
<v Speaker 4>so environmental factors.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What communities grow up into,</v>

339
00:17:25.801 --> 00:17:28.740
<v Speaker 4>what you're being exposed to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People imitate their atmosphere.</v>

340
00:17:28.741 --> 00:17:33.741
<v Speaker 4>You're around people that are constantly</v>
<v Speaker 4>in trouble with the law and you're </v>

341
00:17:33.741 --> 00:17:37.161
<v Speaker 4>dealing with horrible environments.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of factors and I think </v>

342
00:17:37.161 --> 00:17:39.780
<v Speaker 4>that one of the things that's really </v>
<v Speaker 4>important about having these discussions</v>

343
00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:44.990
<v Speaker 4>is that they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they break down these rigid ideologies </v>

344
00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:48.560
<v Speaker 4>that a lot of these kids that are going </v>
<v Speaker 4>to these universities are sort of being </v>

345
00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:50.460
<v Speaker 4>shoved into their shoved into these </v>
<v Speaker 4>ideology.</v>

346
00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:55.470
<v Speaker 4>You're either on the left or you're on </v>
<v Speaker 4>the right and there's very few on the </v>

347
00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:58.401
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no open market of ideas when it </v>

348
00:17:58.401 --> 00:18:02.721
<v Speaker 4>comes to discussing these things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're compelled and enforced into </v>

349
00:18:02.721 --> 00:18:06.270
<v Speaker 4>surgeon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a psychologist at the New York,</v>

350
00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:09.800
<v Speaker 4>New York University business school.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's done a really good job</v>

351
00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:13.500
<v Speaker 3>documenting the dearth of ideological </v>
<v Speaker 3>viewpoints,</v>

352
00:18:13.501 --> 00:18:18.501
<v Speaker 3>let's say political or temperamental </v>
<v Speaker 3>viewpoints because that's more accurate </v>

353
00:18:18.501 --> 00:18:22.120
<v Speaker 3>in the modern university and its </v>
<v Speaker 3>appalling because with along with all </v>

354
00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:24.180
<v Speaker 3>this push for ethnic and sexual and </v>
<v Speaker 3>racial diversity,</v>

355
00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:29.100
<v Speaker 3>which I think is just a mask to enforce </v>
<v Speaker 3>a kind of ideological homogeneity,</v>

356
00:18:29.101 --> 00:18:34.101
<v Speaker 3>there's no even understanding that </v>
<v Speaker 3>ideational diversity is the only </v>

357
00:18:35.251 --> 00:18:40.251
<v Speaker 3>relevant value for for a university.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The rest of it's all predicated on the </v>

358
00:18:41.911 --> 00:18:46.911
<v Speaker 3>assumption that if you do select people </v>
<v Speaker 3>because of their ethnicity or racial </v>

359
00:18:46.911 --> 00:18:51.351
<v Speaker 3>background or gender,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that that will in and of itself produce </v>

360
00:18:51.351 --> 00:18:55.220
<v Speaker 3>diversity of ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is another really pernicious idea </v>

361
00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:57.270
<v Speaker 3>because it assumes that and it's so </v>
<v Speaker 3>contradictory.</v>

362
00:18:58.750 --> 00:19:03.750
<v Speaker 3>The left describes anything that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>associated with the assumption that </v>

363
00:19:04.021 --> 00:19:07.020
<v Speaker 3>someone who's female for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>will think in a female way.</v>

364
00:19:07.021 --> 00:19:09.480
<v Speaker 3>They regard that as an unreasonable </v>
<v Speaker 3>prejudice.</v>

365
00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:14.750
<v Speaker 3>You have to perfectly reasonable to say </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we need more women in x discipline </v>

366
00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:17.910
<v Speaker 3>because they will bring in female ideas.</v>

367
00:19:17.910 --> 00:19:18.390
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

368
00:19:18.391 --> 00:19:19.210
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

369
00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:21.210
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What the hell are female ideas?</v>

370
00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:24.650
<v Speaker 3>You can't have it both ways unless </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're completely in,</v>

371
00:19:26.010 --> 00:19:31.010
<v Speaker 3>unless you don't care at all about </v>
<v Speaker 3>coherence or consistency and ideologues </v>

372
00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:33.750
<v Speaker 3>really don't because they care about </v>
<v Speaker 3>putting their ideology fourth,</v>

373
00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:39.260
<v Speaker 3>but the idea that you're going to get a </v>
<v Speaker 3>diversity of ideas because you have a </v>

374
00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:42.141
<v Speaker 3>diversity of of class of people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>assumes that ideas and identity are the </v>

375
00:19:43.921 --> 00:19:47.310
<v Speaker 3>same thing and that's an absurd </v>
<v Speaker 3>proposition.</v>

376
00:19:47.311 --> 00:19:48.300
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's that's.</v>

377
00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:52.800
<v Speaker 3>That's an essentially racial racist </v>
<v Speaker 3>proposition.</v>

378
00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:55.170
<v Speaker 3>Black people think differently than </v>
<v Speaker 3>white people.</v>

379
00:19:55.171 --> 00:20:00.171
<v Speaker 3>It's no some do and some don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the overlap is substantive than the </v>

380
00:20:00.171 --> 00:20:04.581
<v Speaker 3>difference between the individuals is </v>
<v Speaker 3>far greater than the difference between </v>

381
00:20:04.581 --> 00:20:04.581
<v Speaker 3>the group.</v>

382
00:20:04.581 --> 00:20:07.590
<v Speaker 4>I think we also need to make a very </v>
<v Speaker 4>clear distinction between discrimination</v>

383
00:20:07.591 --> 00:20:12.591
<v Speaker 4>and people that are just inclined to </v>
<v Speaker 4>gravitate towards different careers and </v>

384
00:20:12.591 --> 00:20:15.851
<v Speaker 4>different focuses.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There is a big difference between women </v>

385
00:20:15.851 --> 00:20:19.191
<v Speaker 4>being forced out of tech and women being</v>
<v Speaker 4>not as compelled to enter into tech </v>

386
00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:21.840
<v Speaker 4>careers as men,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we're well that,</v>

387
00:20:21.841 --> 00:20:22.250
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

388
00:20:22.250 --> 00:20:27.250
<v Speaker 3>that tech,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the tech issue is a really interesting </v>

389
00:20:27.250 --> 00:20:27.670
<v Speaker 3>one for a couple of reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One is that of course,</v>

390
00:20:27.671 --> 00:20:32.440
<v Speaker 3>high tech basically developed after the </v>
<v Speaker 3>playing field for men and women was more</v>

391
00:20:32.441 --> 00:20:34.870
<v Speaker 3>or less level,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that happened in the 19 seventies</v>

392
00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:39.820
<v Speaker 3>and despite that there weren't any near </v>
<v Speaker 3>anywhere near as many women in tech.</v>

393
00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:44.900
<v Speaker 3>There's far more women in caring </v>
<v Speaker 3>professions and you see that </v>

394
00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:47.820
<v Speaker 3>particularly in Scandinavia where </v>
<v Speaker 3>they've done everything they can to </v>

395
00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:50.611
<v Speaker 3>equal to equalize the playing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's 20 to one female to male nurses and</v>

396
00:20:50.741 --> 00:20:53.080
<v Speaker 3>20 to one male to female engineers.</v>

397
00:20:53.310 --> 00:20:58.310
<v Speaker 4>Matt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you could the Scandinavian issue </v>

398
00:20:58.310 --> 00:20:58.310
<v Speaker 4>because it's very interesting.</v>

399
00:20:58.310 --> 00:21:01.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's done over there and what the </v>

400
00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:01.190
<v Speaker 3>results of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

401
00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:03.160
<v Speaker 3>Well imagine that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are two reasons that people differ</v>

402
00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:04.060
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are more than two,</v>

403
00:21:04.061 --> 00:21:06.100
<v Speaker 3>but just imagine for the time being that</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are two.</v>

404
00:21:06.101 --> 00:21:08.500
<v Speaker 3>One is for environmental reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cultural reasons,</v>

405
00:21:08.501 --> 00:21:13.501
<v Speaker 3>and the other is for biological reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What happens if you flatten out the </v>

406
00:21:13.501 --> 00:21:18.061
<v Speaker 3>environmental reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is what's happened in Scandinavia </v>

407
00:21:18.061 --> 00:21:18.670
<v Speaker 3>is you maximize the biological </v>
<v Speaker 3>differences.</v>

408
00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:20.770
<v Speaker 3>You don't get rid of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you maximize them.</v>

409
00:21:20.771 --> 00:21:25.771
<v Speaker 3>And so what's happened in Scandinavia is</v>
<v Speaker 3>that men and women are more different </v>

410
00:21:25.771 --> 00:21:26.230
<v Speaker 3>from a temperament,</v>
<v Speaker 3>personality perspective,</v>

411
00:21:26.231 --> 00:21:31.231
<v Speaker 3>and also in terms of their interests.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're more different in scandinavia </v>

412
00:21:31.231 --> 00:21:31.630
<v Speaker 3>than they are anywhere else in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

413
00:21:32.030 --> 00:21:37.030
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what have they done to try to flatten </v>

414
00:21:37.030 --> 00:21:37.030
<v Speaker 3>things out?</v>
<v Speaker 3>As you say?</v>

415
00:21:37.030 --> 00:21:40.050
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've transformed their social policy </v>

416
00:21:40.050 --> 00:21:40.270
<v Speaker 3>so that men and women have as close to </v>
<v Speaker 3>equal opportunity say,</v>

417
00:21:40.271 --> 00:21:45.271
<v Speaker 3>as any society has managed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that hasn't produced the hope for </v>

418
00:21:45.271 --> 00:21:45.730
<v Speaker 3>equality of outcome.</v>

419
00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:47.830
<v Speaker 3>Quite quite the contrary in many </v>
<v Speaker 3>situations.</v>

420
00:21:47.831 --> 00:21:49.980
<v Speaker 3>It's exaggerated it and you could say </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

421
00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:53.170
<v Speaker 3>that that's actually okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that what you want?</v>

422
00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:58.440
<v Speaker 3>What you want is to have a society where</v>
<v Speaker 3>the genuine differences between people </v>

423
00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:00.730
<v Speaker 3>are free to manifest themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So for example,</v>

424
00:22:00.731 --> 00:22:02.680
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you have three or four kids,</v>

425
00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:08.160
<v Speaker 3>say the kids are going to be a different</v>
<v Speaker 3>from one another genetically,</v>

426
00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:13.590
<v Speaker 3>that's why they're not identical twins.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They differ genetically and if you set </v>

427
00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:14.800
<v Speaker 3>the environment up so that each child is</v>
<v Speaker 3>supportive,</v>

428
00:22:14.801 --> 00:22:16.840
<v Speaker 3>that children actually turned out quite </v>
<v Speaker 3>differently.</v>

429
00:22:17.410 --> 00:22:19.000
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're an absolute brute and you beat</v>

430
00:22:19.001 --> 00:22:24.001
<v Speaker 3>them and you abused them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then they'll all turn out the same </v>

431
00:22:24.001 --> 00:22:24.001
<v Speaker 3>because there's tremendous environmental</v>
<v Speaker 3>influence on them then,</v>

432
00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:29.160
<v Speaker 3>but if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you form an individual relationship </v>

433
00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:30.640
<v Speaker 3>with each of them and allow their </v>
<v Speaker 3>strengths to manifest themselves as they</v>

434
00:22:30.641 --> 00:22:31.600
<v Speaker 3>will in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a,</v>

435
00:22:31.601 --> 00:22:36.601
<v Speaker 3>in a supportive environment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the kids are going to turn out very </v>

436
00:22:36.601 --> 00:22:39.331
<v Speaker 3>different and so a free society is </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually one that that produces </v>

437
00:22:39.331 --> 00:22:43.561
<v Speaker 3>massively unequal outcomes because it </v>
<v Speaker 3>allows the genuine differences between </v>

438
00:22:43.561 --> 00:22:43.750
<v Speaker 3>people to manifest themselves.</v>

439
00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:48.100
<v Speaker 3>These people who are pushing equity at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is equality of outcome.</v>

440
00:22:48.130 --> 00:22:50.560
<v Speaker 3>That's what the word equity codes for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>By the way,</v>

441
00:22:50.561 --> 00:22:52.960
<v Speaker 3>equality of outcome and not equality of </v>
<v Speaker 3>opportunity.</v>

442
00:22:53.830 --> 00:22:58.830
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what in the world they do </v>
<v Speaker 3>with regards to the fact that a very </v>

443
00:22:58.830 --> 00:23:00.830
<v Speaker 3>large number of professions are high </v>
<v Speaker 3>quality,</v>

444
00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:05.840
<v Speaker 3>high,</v>
<v Speaker 3>high paid professions are female </v>

445
00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:05.840
<v Speaker 3>dominated physicians,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

446
00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:06.530
<v Speaker 3>psychologists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

447
00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:11.640
<v Speaker 3>any,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any of the disciplines that have to do </v>

448
00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:11.640
<v Speaker 3>with human care almost inevitably </v>
<v Speaker 3>dominated by women.</v>

449
00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:14.110
<v Speaker 3>And that's increasingly the case is that</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're supposed to stop that.</v>

450
00:23:14.140 --> 00:23:19.140
<v Speaker 3>Is that also a sign of oppression?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to force women to do things </v>

451
00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:19.140
<v Speaker 3>they're not interested in.</v>

452
00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:24.400
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's also a very disingenuous way of </v>

453
00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:24.400
<v Speaker 4>framing it here in America where people </v>
<v Speaker 4>consistently,</v>

454
00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:28.511
<v Speaker 4>even the president of United States,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Obama was talking about income </v>

455
00:23:28.511 --> 00:23:29.710
<v Speaker 4>inequality and the way they frame income</v>
<v Speaker 4>inequality.</v>

456
00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:31.820
<v Speaker 4>They talk about the seventy nine cents </v>
<v Speaker 4>to the dollar,</v>

457
00:23:31.821 --> 00:23:36.821
<v Speaker 4>but what they don't discuss that we're </v>
<v Speaker 4>talking about completely different </v>

458
00:23:36.821 --> 00:23:36.821
<v Speaker 4>careers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're not.</v>

459
00:23:36.821 --> 00:23:41.050
<v Speaker 4>The way they frame it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they frame it as if two people are </v>

460
00:23:41.050 --> 00:23:41.050
<v Speaker 4>working side by side.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One is a man,</v>

461
00:23:41.050 --> 00:23:41.870
<v Speaker 4>one is a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're both doing the same job.</v>

462
00:23:41.871 --> 00:23:43.790
<v Speaker 4>The man makes a dollar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The woman who makes seventy nine cents,</v>

463
00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:46.670
<v Speaker 4>that is not the case.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's typical of ideological</v>

464
00:23:46.850 --> 00:23:49.190
<v Speaker 2>conversation because what happens </v>
<v Speaker 2>technically,</v>

465
00:23:49.191 --> 00:23:54.191
<v Speaker 2>like imagine that a given.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We talked about poverty a few minutes </v>

466
00:23:54.191 --> 00:23:54.191
<v Speaker 2>ago and you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

467
00:23:54.191 --> 00:23:54.470
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's many,</v>

468
00:23:54.471 --> 00:23:57.530
<v Speaker 2>many reasons that one person might have </v>
<v Speaker 2>more money than another.</v>

469
00:23:58.120 --> 00:24:00.800
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are many,</v>

470
00:24:00.801 --> 00:24:05.300
<v Speaker 2>many reasons why women might make less </v>
<v Speaker 2>money on average than men.</v>

471
00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:10.340
<v Speaker 2>There.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are small businesses that women </v>

472
00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:10.340
<v Speaker 2>run,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

473
00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:11.540
<v Speaker 2>make far less money than men's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the small businesses that men run.</v>

474
00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:16.750
<v Speaker 2>But that's partly because a lot of women</v>
<v Speaker 2>run their businesses part time because </v>

475
00:24:16.750 --> 00:24:19.991
<v Speaker 2>they have kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's also partly because men do all the </v>

476
00:24:19.991 --> 00:24:20.120
<v Speaker 2>horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dangerous jobs,</v>

477
00:24:20.570 --> 00:24:22.340
<v Speaker 2>the ones where there's a high chance of </v>
<v Speaker 2>dying,</v>

478
00:24:22.341 --> 00:24:24.410
<v Speaker 2>men are much more likely to work </v>
<v Speaker 2>outside.</v>

479
00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:27.620
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>men are much more likely to move in,</v>

480
00:24:27.910 --> 00:24:31.100
<v Speaker 2>in pursuit of a career opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are lots of reasons that,</v>

481
00:24:31.490 --> 00:24:33.560
<v Speaker 2>that men and women differ in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 2>their income.</v>

482
00:24:33.561 --> 00:24:35.930
<v Speaker 2>But if you're an idiot log,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can only handle one variable.</v>

483
00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:41.020
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>men and women measured on mass don't </v>

484
00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:41.840
<v Speaker 2>have the same incomes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Therefore the system is corrupt.</v>

485
00:24:42.110 --> 00:24:47.110
<v Speaker 2>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much thinking does it take to come </v>

486
00:24:47.110 --> 00:24:47.960
<v Speaker 2>up with a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a theoretical scenario like that?</v>

487
00:24:48.110 --> 00:24:52.070
<v Speaker 2>So boneheaded and it just runs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just pushes the ideological,</v>

488
00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:56.330
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just pushes the ideology forward with</v>

489
00:24:56.331 --> 00:24:56.960
<v Speaker 2>no thought.</v>

490
00:24:57.060 --> 00:24:58.290
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a professor,</v>

491
00:24:58.410 --> 00:25:03.410
<v Speaker 1>why is this sort of objective reasoning </v>
<v Speaker 1>and really absolutely honest assessment </v>

492
00:25:05.011 --> 00:25:09.630
<v Speaker 1>of this situation?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is it so rare amongst professors?</v>

493
00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:14.400
<v Speaker 1>Why is it so rare in universities?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is this such an unusual subject?</v>

494
00:25:14.910 --> 00:25:16.880
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the reason is is that when,</v>

495
00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:21.900
<v Speaker 1>when people first encounter a complex </v>
<v Speaker 1>topic like income differences,</v>

496
00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:30.280
<v Speaker 2>it's like imagine you were drawing a map</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the territory and you don't know the </v>

497
00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:34.041
<v Speaker 2>territory very well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first thing you do is just roughly </v>

498
00:25:34.041 --> 00:25:36.300
<v Speaker 2>sketch out the shapes of the continence </v>
<v Speaker 2>and maybe you're wrong.</v>

499
00:25:36.450 --> 00:25:38.760
<v Speaker 2>Like the early European maps of North </v>
<v Speaker 2>America,</v>

500
00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:40.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you kind of get one coastline,</v>

501
00:25:40.650 --> 00:25:43.380
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Guests and the rest it's blurry and gray</v>

502
00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:46.200
<v Speaker 2>and then as you investigate more and </v>
<v Speaker 2>more,</v>

503
00:25:46.201 --> 00:25:51.201
<v Speaker 2>your picture of the situation becomes </v>
<v Speaker 2>higher and higher and higher and higher </v>

504
00:25:51.201 --> 00:25:55.080
<v Speaker 2>resolution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to go from a low resolution </v>

505
00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:58.401
<v Speaker 2>representation to a high resolution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Representation and ideologies are low </v>

506
00:25:58.401 --> 00:26:02.481
<v Speaker 2>resolution representations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the thing about a low resolution </v>

507
00:26:02.481 --> 00:26:04.380
<v Speaker 2>representations is it looks like it </v>
<v Speaker 2>covers everything,</v>

508
00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:07.110
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The closer you look,</v>

509
00:26:07.111 --> 00:26:08.730
<v Speaker 2>the more details there are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

510
00:26:08.731 --> 00:26:10.620
<v Speaker 2>if you get a three year old to draw a </v>
<v Speaker 2>helicopter,</v>

511
00:26:10.621 --> 00:26:15.621
<v Speaker 2>they put like a little cross on the top </v>
<v Speaker 2>and a circle in a stick and another </v>

512
00:26:15.621 --> 00:26:16.170
<v Speaker 2>circle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the helicopter.</v>

513
00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:17.100
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

514
00:26:17.101 --> 00:26:18.690
<v Speaker 2>when you look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a helicopter,</v>

515
00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:21.330
<v Speaker 2>but no one would expect that thing to </v>
<v Speaker 2>fly.</v>

516
00:26:21.690 --> 00:26:24.270
<v Speaker 2>If you want to change that into a real </v>
<v Speaker 2>model of a helicopter,</v>

517
00:26:24.271 --> 00:26:28.140
<v Speaker 2>you have to increase your focus and </v>
<v Speaker 2>concentration on every single element of</v>

518
00:26:28.141 --> 00:26:32.760
<v Speaker 2>the entity and that takes a tremendous </v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of cognitive effort and sometimes</v>

519
00:26:32.761 --> 00:26:34.920
<v Speaker 2>you don't even know what you don't know </v>
<v Speaker 2>about something.</v>

520
00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:36.900
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could say,</v>

521
00:26:36.901 --> 00:26:39.900
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are 50 reasons why men and women's</v>

522
00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:41.610
<v Speaker 2>income differ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

523
00:26:41.611 --> 00:26:44.220
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't mean I can all</v>

524
00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:48.570
<v Speaker 3>50 of those differences in each of those</v>
<v Speaker 3>50 differences are fragmented into maybe</v>

525
00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:53.870
<v Speaker 3>another dozen categories each.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe there's 600 reasons why men and </v>

526
00:26:53.870 --> 00:26:57.711
<v Speaker 3>women's salary differ,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you have to spend a tremendous </v>

527
00:26:57.711 --> 00:27:01.911
<v Speaker 3>amount of time paying attention and </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking to build your model of reality </v>

528
00:27:01.911 --> 00:27:06.351
<v Speaker 3>into that level of resolution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And basically what you do is default to </v>

529
00:27:06.351 --> 00:27:09.000
<v Speaker 3>temperamentally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm influenced ideologies.</v>

530
00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:11.160
<v Speaker 3>They give you a one bit answer to </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>

531
00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:16.460
<v Speaker 3>Why are men and women?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why do men and women's salaries </v>

532
00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:18.420
<v Speaker 3>different oppression?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's always the same thing and it makes.</v>

533
00:27:18.430 --> 00:27:23.430
<v Speaker 3>It makes you feel like you know </v>
<v Speaker 3>something and people like that because </v>

534
00:27:23.430 --> 00:27:25.590
<v Speaker 3>they don't like the I the feeling that </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's something they don't know,</v>

535
00:27:25.591 --> 00:27:28.170
<v Speaker 3>they don't like to be in chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's basically chaos.</v>

536
00:27:28.171 --> 00:27:32.520
<v Speaker 3>They like to be an order.</v>
<v Speaker 3>An order is where you know everything so</v>

537
00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:37.880
<v Speaker 3>and professors are no different,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no different than than than people </v>

538
00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:39.600
<v Speaker 3>obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Given that there are people,</v>

539
00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:41.790
<v Speaker 3>maybe they're more intelligent on </v>
<v Speaker 3>average.</v>

540
00:27:42.570 --> 00:27:47.570
<v Speaker 3>They're also more sheltered,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say in many ways on average and </v>

541
00:27:47.570 --> 00:27:49.080
<v Speaker 3>they're also not challenged as often </v>
<v Speaker 3>tenure,</v>

542
00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:54.540
<v Speaker 4>10 years in issue and also not competing</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the marketplace,</v>

543
00:27:54.550 --> 00:27:58.810
<v Speaker 4>not being in the workforce,</v>
<v Speaker 4>going from being in high school to being</v>

544
00:27:58.811 --> 00:28:02.140
<v Speaker 4>in universities,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to getting a degree to teaching,</v>

545
00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:04.240
<v Speaker 4>to being a professor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to getting tenured,</v>

546
00:28:04.330 --> 00:28:06.400
<v Speaker 4>staying inside of that intellectual </v>
<v Speaker 4>bubble.</v>

547
00:28:06.890 --> 00:28:07.970
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well it's complicated.</v>

548
00:28:07.971 --> 00:28:09.890
<v Speaker 3>Often these things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these things happen.</v>

549
00:28:09.891 --> 00:28:11.720
<v Speaker 3>They're like positive feedback loops.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

550
00:28:11.721 --> 00:28:13.910
<v Speaker 3>when you bring a speaker too close to </v>
<v Speaker 3>her microphone,</v>

551
00:28:13.911 --> 00:28:18.911
<v Speaker 3>too close to a speaker and it starts to </v>
<v Speaker 3>howl and I think something like that's </v>

552
00:28:18.911 --> 00:28:20.900
<v Speaker 3>happened in the universities is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they started to tilt towards the left in</v>

553
00:28:20.901 --> 00:28:25.901
<v Speaker 3>the sixties and then as they tilted they</v>
<v Speaker 3>tilted harder and as they tilled it </v>

554
00:28:25.901 --> 00:28:30.190
<v Speaker 3>harder,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they tilt it even harder until all of </v>

555
00:28:30.190 --> 00:28:32.180
<v Speaker 3>the diversity was forced out of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>universities and I don't know if it's so</v>

556
00:28:32.181 --> 00:28:35.060
<v Speaker 3>much a consequence of the actual </v>
<v Speaker 3>policies of the university as,</v>

557
00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:38.120
<v Speaker 3>as just a feedback process that got out </v>
<v Speaker 3>of control.</v>

558
00:28:38.660 --> 00:28:41.780
<v Speaker 3>I mean if it's 50 percent liberals and </v>
<v Speaker 3>50 percent conservatives,</v>

559
00:28:41.781 --> 00:28:42.860
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no problem.</v>

560
00:28:43.310 --> 00:28:46.610
<v Speaker 3>But if it's 70 percent liberals and 30 </v>
<v Speaker 3>percent conservatives,</v>

561
00:28:46.611 --> 00:28:51.170
<v Speaker 3>maybe it rapidly goes to 99 percent </v>
<v Speaker 3>liberals and one percent conservatives.</v>

562
00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:52.580
<v Speaker 3>Is that what it's like right now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

563
00:28:52.581 --> 00:28:55.130
<v Speaker 3>what is it when you look at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>University of Toronto,</v>

564
00:28:55.610 --> 00:28:56.900
<v Speaker 3>where you are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

565
00:28:56.960 --> 00:28:58.720
<v Speaker 3>what is the number?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you had to guess?</v>

566
00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:04.880
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would depend to some degree on the </v>

567
00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:04.880
<v Speaker 3>discipline,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

568
00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:07.290
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but professors are also also tend to be </v>

569
00:29:07.290 --> 00:29:09.760
<v Speaker 3>characterized by personality traits that</v>
<v Speaker 3>do tilt them towards liberalism.</v>

570
00:29:09.761 --> 00:29:13.480
<v Speaker 3>They're higher in trait openness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is both creativity and interest in</v>

571
00:29:13.481 --> 00:29:18.481
<v Speaker 3>ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the things that </v>

572
00:29:18.481 --> 00:29:18.481
<v Speaker 3>temperamentally distinguishes liberals </v>
<v Speaker 3>from conservatives.</v>

573
00:29:18.481 --> 00:29:22.860
<v Speaker 3>Conservatives are more conscientious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're more orderly and industrious </v>

574
00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:23.950
<v Speaker 3>liberals are more open,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they're more interested in aesthetics</v>

575
00:29:23.951 --> 00:29:28.951
<v Speaker 3>and ideas and of course being interested</v>
<v Speaker 3>in this statics and ideas does tilt you </v>

576
00:29:28.951 --> 00:29:30.240
<v Speaker 3>towards an academic career.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

577
00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:35.270
<v Speaker 3>it's hard to tell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it certainly the bulk of the bulk</v>

578
00:29:35.271 --> 00:29:38.780
<v Speaker 3>of intellectuals are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are liberal and liberal,</v>

579
00:29:38.781 --> 00:29:41.710
<v Speaker 3>left virtually all of them I would say.</v>

580
00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:44.140
<v Speaker 3>And then that's probably not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not as true.</v>

581
00:29:44.141 --> 00:29:46.210
<v Speaker 3>We know this is not as true in the hard </v>
<v Speaker 3>sciences,</v>

582
00:29:46.710 --> 00:29:48.520
<v Speaker 3>but in the social sciences and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>humanities,</v>

583
00:29:48.521 --> 00:29:51.430
<v Speaker 3>it's the overwhelming majority.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

584
00:29:51.431 --> 00:29:56.431
<v Speaker 3>I could see that even in this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in this battle that I've been in Canada </v>

585
00:29:56.431 --> 00:29:59.671
<v Speaker 3>with regards to bill [inaudible] in </v>
<v Speaker 3>these compelled pronouns that almost no </v>

586
00:29:59.671 --> 00:30:01.330
<v Speaker 3>support from my faculty colleagues now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't expect any.</v>

587
00:30:01.331 --> 00:30:02.980
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm not shocked by that,</v>

588
00:30:03.370 --> 00:30:08.370
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's an indication that if you put </v>

589
00:30:08.370 --> 00:30:11.610
<v Speaker 3>to them a choice between social justice </v>
<v Speaker 3>slash all consuming compassion and </v>

590
00:30:13.001 --> 00:30:16.240
<v Speaker 3>freedom of expression,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going to tilt hard towards the,</v>

591
00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:18.820
<v Speaker 3>the social justice compassion end of </v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

592
00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:21.580
<v Speaker 3>It almost seemed like when I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>watching some of the debates that you've</v>

593
00:30:21.581 --> 00:30:26.581
<v Speaker 3>engaged in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it almost seems like they're </v>

594
00:30:26.581 --> 00:30:26.581
<v Speaker 3>politicians.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some seems like they,</v>

595
00:30:26.581 --> 00:30:27.010
<v Speaker 3>their wedding,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their finger and going with the breeze.</v>

596
00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:29.290
<v Speaker 3>There's some conversations that you had </v>
<v Speaker 3>that were just.</v>

597
00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:33.010
<v Speaker 3>I had to stop and rewind them because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>couldn't believe the arguments.</v>

598
00:30:33.490 --> 00:30:36.110
<v Speaker 3>There was a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know it was.</v>

599
00:30:37.630 --> 00:30:42.490
<v Speaker 3>Was it a transgender man that you were </v>
<v Speaker 3>having a discussion with that was saying</v>

600
00:30:42.491 --> 00:30:46.050
<v Speaker 3>that there's no difference?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No biological difference in the sexist,</v>

601
00:30:46.180 --> 00:30:51.180
<v Speaker 3>new biological difference.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said that the scientific consensus </v>

602
00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:51.180
<v Speaker 3>for the last court date,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure.</v>

603
00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:52.450
<v Speaker 3>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe so.</v>

604
00:30:52.451 --> 00:30:57.451
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was a professor who taught </v>

605
00:30:57.451 --> 00:30:57.451
<v Speaker 3>transgender studies at the University of</v>
<v Speaker 3>Toronto and yeah,</v>

606
00:30:57.451 --> 00:31:02.191
<v Speaker 3>and he said outright that there were no </v>
<v Speaker 3>biological differences between men and </v>

607
00:31:02.191 --> 00:31:03.160
<v Speaker 3>women and that that was the scientific </v>
<v Speaker 3>consensus.</v>

608
00:31:03.340 --> 00:31:08.340
<v Speaker 3>And he and he believed that he had the </v>
<v Speaker 3>qualifications to say that because he </v>

609
00:31:08.340 --> 00:31:09.190
<v Speaker 3>was a historian of medicine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which,</v>

610
00:31:09.670 --> 00:31:14.670
<v Speaker 3>which hardly qualifies as scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not that you have to be a scientist to </v>

611
00:31:14.670 --> 00:31:17.200
<v Speaker 3>notice that there are biological </v>
<v Speaker 3>differences between men and women.</v>

612
00:31:17.410 --> 00:31:22.410
<v Speaker 3>It was very bizarre for me at that at </v>
<v Speaker 3>that point in this in the last few </v>

613
00:31:22.410 --> 00:31:26.160
<v Speaker 3>months because I was under substantial </v>
<v Speaker 3>pressure from the university to stop </v>

614
00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:30.211
<v Speaker 3>repeating my claim,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I wouldn't use compelled pronouns </v>

615
00:31:30.211 --> 00:31:34.830
<v Speaker 3>to refer to people because the </v>
<v Speaker 3>university regarded that is against the </v>

616
00:31:34.830 --> 00:31:36.400
<v Speaker 3>university policies and also against the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ontario Human Rights Code.</v>

617
00:31:36.730 --> 00:31:40.330
<v Speaker 3>So also illegal and as my employers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're responsible for everything.</v>

618
00:31:40.331 --> 00:31:43.060
<v Speaker 3>I say whether or not there has been a </v>
<v Speaker 3>complaint made,</v>

619
00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:48.240
<v Speaker 3>whether or not the consequence of my </v>
<v Speaker 3>speeches intended or unintended because </v>

620
00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:49.210
<v Speaker 3>that's built into the legislation and </v>
<v Speaker 3>believe me,</v>

621
00:31:49.211 --> 00:31:52.630
<v Speaker 3>that's coming your way because this </v>
<v Speaker 3>legislation spreads like mad,</v>

622
00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:57.900
<v Speaker 3>but on the one hand I was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got two letters of warning from the </v>

623
00:31:57.900 --> 00:32:00.580
<v Speaker 3>university for refusing to use these </v>
<v Speaker 3>compelled pronouns,</v>

624
00:32:00.581 --> 00:32:05.581
<v Speaker 3>which I regard as the ideological </v>
<v Speaker 3>constructions of radical left wingers </v>

625
00:32:05.581 --> 00:32:09.960
<v Speaker 3>and this professor went on the agenda.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is Ontario new show and announced </v>

626
00:32:09.971 --> 00:32:12.910
<v Speaker 3>publicly that there are no biological </v>
<v Speaker 3>differences between men and women.</v>

627
00:32:12.911 --> 00:32:13.810
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Huh.</v>

628
00:32:14.290 --> 00:32:19.290
<v Speaker 3>You think maybe the university would </v>
<v Speaker 3>have had something to say about that </v>

629
00:32:19.290 --> 00:32:19.290
<v Speaker 3>since they do in fact have a biology </v>
<v Speaker 3>department,</v>

630
00:32:19.660 --> 00:32:20.500
<v Speaker 3>but.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh No.</v>

631
00:32:20.530 --> 00:32:21.160
<v Speaker 3>That,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

632
00:32:21.340 --> 00:32:23.770
<v Speaker 3>that went by without notice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was perfectly fine.</v>

633
00:32:24.060 --> 00:32:29.060
<v Speaker 3>Is saying it's such an insane thing to </v>
<v Speaker 3>say if there's no biological difference </v>

634
00:32:29.060 --> 00:32:29.770
<v Speaker 3>than why they taking hormones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

635
00:32:29.771 --> 00:32:34.771
<v Speaker 3>that's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why bother with the surgery and the </v>

636
00:32:34.771 --> 00:32:34.771
<v Speaker 3>horror?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially the hormones.</v>

637
00:32:34.771 --> 00:32:38.701
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because that's not like you could argue </v>

638
00:32:38.701 --> 00:32:38.701
<v Speaker 3>with surgery that that's cosmetic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

639
00:32:38.701 --> 00:32:40.220
<v Speaker 3>This person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whoever this professor</v>

640
00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:44.250
<v Speaker 1>was as a expert in transgender studies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nicholas,</v>

641
00:32:44.270 --> 00:32:45.430
<v Speaker 1>Matt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

642
00:32:45.530 --> 00:32:48.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure that used to be a woman </v>
<v Speaker 1>or she,</v>

643
00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:54.040
<v Speaker 1>they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not allowed to say that if you </v>

644
00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:56.321
<v Speaker 1>say that you're a bad person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you say they and they in them is the </v>

645
00:32:56.321 --> 00:32:59.790
<v Speaker 1>most reasonable of these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a pronoun,</v>

646
00:32:59.791 --> 00:33:01.700
<v Speaker 1>these alternative pronouns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they and them,</v>

647
00:33:01.970 --> 00:33:06.970
<v Speaker 1>like you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you know a guy and he does know how </v>

648
00:33:06.970 --> 00:33:10.481
<v Speaker 1>to swim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they should probably stay out of the </v>

649
00:33:10.481 --> 00:33:10.481
<v Speaker 1>pool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

650
00:33:10.481 --> 00:33:10.610
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can say that you could use that in a</v>

651
00:33:10.611 --> 00:33:12.470
<v Speaker 1>non polar will form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

652
00:33:12.471 --> 00:33:16.010
<v Speaker 1>and they is used to repair awkward </v>
<v Speaker 1>sentences basically,</v>

653
00:33:16.011 --> 00:33:21.011
<v Speaker 1>but it's never been used despite the </v>
<v Speaker 1>claims of the of the gender bender </v>

654
00:33:21.011 --> 00:33:24.641
<v Speaker 1>activists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's never been used for the singular </v>

655
00:33:24.641 --> 00:33:24.641
<v Speaker 1>and we shouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We shouldn't,</v>

656
00:33:24.641 --> 00:33:25.040
<v Speaker 1>we shouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we shouldn't.</v>

657
00:33:25.041 --> 00:33:27.680
<v Speaker 1>All just language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't give up the distinction between</v>

658
00:33:27.681 --> 00:33:28.850
<v Speaker 1>the plural news segment or now.</v>

659
00:33:28.850 --> 00:33:33.020
<v Speaker 1>It's certainly need to know whether it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>one person or more than one person.</v>

660
00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:38.080
<v Speaker 1>Do you think it's reasonable for people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are asexual people that really are </v>

661
00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:39.830
<v Speaker 1>uncomfortable with the idea of being a </v>
<v Speaker 1>man or a woman?</v>

662
00:33:39.831 --> 00:33:42.740
<v Speaker 1>Is it reasonable that we come up with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>distinction for that?</v>

663
00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:47.980
<v Speaker 1>I mean that seems like it would be nice </v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is one of the things that </v>

664
00:33:47.980 --> 00:33:47.980
<v Speaker 1>you've said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the,</v>

665
00:33:47.980 --> 00:33:48.620
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that you don't like </v>
<v Speaker 1>about this,</v>

666
00:33:48.621 --> 00:33:53.621
<v Speaker 1>that you're being compelled to use these</v>
<v Speaker 1>made up pronouns and that if we as a </v>

667
00:33:53.621 --> 00:33:54.680
<v Speaker 1>society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a culture,</v>

668
00:33:54.681 --> 00:33:59.681
<v Speaker 1>as a civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of adopt a new phrase that you </v>

669
00:33:59.681 --> 00:34:02.360
<v Speaker 1>would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That one we had transexual were.</v>

670
00:34:02.361 --> 00:34:03.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I know.</v>

671
00:34:03.771 --> 00:34:07.160
<v Speaker 1>I know that's problematic because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>not asexual.</v>

672
00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:10.370
<v Speaker 1>Transexual would be transitioned and </v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the other distinction.</v>

673
00:34:10.371 --> 00:34:15.371
<v Speaker 1>This is another important thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those aren't the people that have the </v>

674
00:34:15.371 --> 00:34:15.371
<v Speaker 1>problem with it.</v>

675
00:34:15.371 --> 00:34:16.160
<v Speaker 1>The people that have the problem with </v>
<v Speaker 1>these pronouns,</v>

676
00:34:16.370 --> 00:34:18.920
<v Speaker 1>the transsexual community almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>entirely,</v>

677
00:34:19.100 --> 00:34:24.100
<v Speaker 1>or at least I shouldn't say entirely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but predominantly prefer the alternative</v>

678
00:34:24.450 --> 00:34:29.450
<v Speaker 1>pronoun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A male to female transgender person </v>

679
00:34:29.450 --> 00:34:32.110
<v Speaker 1>prefers to be called a woman or she and </v>
<v Speaker 1>use the female pronouns and male </v>

680
00:34:32.110 --> 00:34:32.110
<v Speaker 1>opponents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

681
00:34:32.110 --> 00:34:36.601
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's some tinies abolition of the </v>

682
00:34:36.601 --> 00:34:40.690
<v Speaker 1>Trans Sexual Community,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or we could say there's some tiny </v>

683
00:34:40.690 --> 00:34:42.371
<v Speaker 1>fraction of people who are identifying </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves with the transgender </v>

684
00:34:42.371 --> 00:34:43.970
<v Speaker 1>community,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is already a tiny fraction.</v>

685
00:34:44.210 --> 00:34:49.210
<v Speaker 1>Who claims that they have an identity </v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't fit into either binary </v>

686
00:34:49.210 --> 00:34:50.040
<v Speaker 1>category.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

687
00:34:50.180 --> 00:34:55.180
<v Speaker 1>it's a proposition that I think bears </v>
<v Speaker 1>some scrutiny to begin with because I </v>

688
00:34:55.180 --> 00:34:58.640
<v Speaker 1>don't believe that the claims that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>tiny community is making our coherent in</v>

689
00:34:58.641 --> 00:35:00.380
<v Speaker 1>any sense because they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

690
00:35:00.381 --> 00:35:02.900
<v Speaker 1>you could be man woman or neither or </v>
<v Speaker 1>both.</v>

691
00:35:02.930 --> 00:35:04.140
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

692
00:35:04.270 --> 00:35:07.190
<v Speaker 1>it's those aren't coherent claims in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>estimation,</v>

693
00:35:07.191 --> 00:35:12.191
<v Speaker 1>and if what they're saying is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we don't fit into a category and </v>

694
00:35:13.011 --> 00:35:16.820
<v Speaker 1>therefore we get to invent our own </v>
<v Speaker 1>plurality of categories,</v>

695
00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:20.720
<v Speaker 1>it's not logically tenable that isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>how it works because you get an infinite</v>

696
00:35:20.721 --> 00:35:25.721
<v Speaker 1>number of categories out of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what's happening already </v>

697
00:35:25.721 --> 00:35:27.230
<v Speaker 1>online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of my favorite stories came out of,</v>

698
00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:31.160
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an all girls university in Massachusetts</v>

699
00:35:31.220 --> 00:35:36.220
<v Speaker 1>where a group of women where they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to pick a president of the </v>

700
00:35:36.591 --> 00:35:37.860
<v Speaker 1>student body or whatever.</v>

701
00:35:38.190 --> 00:35:41.760
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the girls who went to that school</v>

702
00:35:42.030 --> 00:35:47.030
<v Speaker 4>decided that she identified as a man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So she changed her name and I don't </v>

703
00:35:47.851 --> 00:35:50.280
<v Speaker 4>believe there was any hormones or </v>
<v Speaker 4>anything involved.</v>

704
00:35:50.281 --> 00:35:53.550
<v Speaker 4>I think she just changed her name.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She called herself masculine of center,</v>

705
00:35:53.750 --> 00:35:56.910
<v Speaker 4>Gender Queer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>changed your name to a masculine name,</v>

706
00:35:57.750 --> 00:36:00.450
<v Speaker 4>ran for president of whatever the hell </v>
<v Speaker 4>this is.</v>

707
00:36:00.510 --> 00:36:01.950
<v Speaker 4>I think it was willingly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

708
00:36:01.951 --> 00:36:06.951
<v Speaker 4>I believe you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One and then was denounced by the rest </v>

709
00:36:06.951 --> 00:36:09.720
<v Speaker 4>of the class because now she was a white</v>
<v Speaker 4>male.</v>

710
00:36:09.721 --> 00:36:13.920
<v Speaker 4>So she was a part of the patriarchy and </v>
<v Speaker 4>she was a part of the whole problem with</v>

711
00:36:13.921 --> 00:36:18.921
<v Speaker 4>society and that she should not be </v>
<v Speaker 4>allowed or he should not be allowed to </v>

712
00:36:18.921 --> 00:36:19.470
<v Speaker 4>take that position,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I just,</v>

713
00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:21.240
<v Speaker 4>I.</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a really good example.</v>

714
00:36:21.241 --> 00:36:23.040
<v Speaker 4>We read it on air and I couldn't stop </v>
<v Speaker 4>laughing.</v>

715
00:36:23.041 --> 00:36:23.560
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well that's good.</v>

716
00:36:23.850 --> 00:36:27.450
<v Speaker 3>That's a really good example of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>chaos that ensues when you start to blow</v>

717
00:36:27.451 --> 00:36:32.451
<v Speaker 3>apart standard categories.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a chaos in between categories </v>

718
00:36:32.451 --> 00:36:34.560
<v Speaker 3>that that's made of a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of an infinite multiplicity.</v>

719
00:36:34.561 --> 00:36:38.070
<v Speaker 3>That's why you see two with the lgbt </v>
<v Speaker 3>rainbow.</v>

720
00:36:38.770 --> 00:36:41.280
<v Speaker 3>They're getting caught in their own </v>
<v Speaker 3>metaphor.</v>

721
00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:46.520
<v Speaker 3>So there's an infinite number of </v>
<v Speaker 3>gradations in a rainbow and there's an </v>

722
00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:49.821
<v Speaker 3>infinite number of letters that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>accumulating on the lgbt rainbow and </v>

723
00:36:50.820 --> 00:36:53.310
<v Speaker 3>there's an element of clear absurdity to</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

724
00:36:53.311 --> 00:36:58.311
<v Speaker 3>And one of them is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe it's q plus that includes the </v>

725
00:36:58.311 --> 00:36:58.950
<v Speaker 3>other kin types.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

726
00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:00.450
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the claim is,</v>

727
00:37:00.451 --> 00:37:01.770
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm marginalized,</v>

728
00:37:01.830 --> 00:37:03.840
<v Speaker 3>and then that sort of becomes </v>
<v Speaker 3>normalized.</v>

729
00:37:03.841 --> 00:37:06.000
<v Speaker 3>And then there's a group right outside </v>
<v Speaker 3>of that that says,</v>

730
00:37:06.001 --> 00:37:07.410
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm marginalized to.</v>

731
00:37:07.411 --> 00:37:08.400
<v Speaker 3>And another group says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

732
00:37:08.401 --> 00:37:09.450
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here I am.</v>

733
00:37:09.630 --> 00:37:14.070
<v Speaker 3>I'm also marginalized and there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely no logic.</v>

734
00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:17.910
<v Speaker 3>Once you've identified yourself as </v>
<v Speaker 3>marginalized,</v>

735
00:37:18.180 --> 00:37:23.180
<v Speaker 3>there's no logical way that you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>exclude anyone else who regard </v>

736
00:37:23.180 --> 00:37:24.900
<v Speaker 3>themselves as marginalized and so the </v>
<v Speaker 3>marginalized,</v>

737
00:37:25.110 --> 00:37:25.550
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

738
00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:30.600
<v Speaker 3>the community of the marginalized </v>
<v Speaker 3>expands and expands and expands and </v>

739
00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:30.600
<v Speaker 3>expands.</v>

740
00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:33.390
<v Speaker 3>And part of the reason for that is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>people are,</v>

741
00:37:33.570 --> 00:37:38.570
<v Speaker 3>every individual is a multiplicity and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's an element to every individual </v>

742
00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:41.340
<v Speaker 3>that's marginalized,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

743
00:37:41.341 --> 00:37:46.341
<v Speaker 3>so for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's clearly the case that when a child </v>

744
00:37:46.921 --> 00:37:49.590
<v Speaker 3>is socialized,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's pros and cons to that.</v>

745
00:37:50.070 --> 00:37:55.070
<v Speaker 3>The pros are the socialization turns the</v>
<v Speaker 3>little beastly two year old into a four </v>

746
00:37:55.070 --> 00:37:59.871
<v Speaker 3>year old that other children can play </v>
<v Speaker 3>with and that that does happen between </v>

747
00:37:59.871 --> 00:38:00.990
<v Speaker 3>the ages of two and four.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If a child is socialized properly,</v>

748
00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:06.280
<v Speaker 3>then then what the child does is kind of</v>
<v Speaker 3>turned into a clone of everyone else so </v>

749
00:38:06.691 --> 00:38:10.620
<v Speaker 3>that he or she can benefit from being </v>
<v Speaker 3>able to interact with everyone else.</v>

750
00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:15.680
<v Speaker 3>Now that that builds up a certain amount</v>
<v Speaker 3>of individuality because kids learn to </v>

751
00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:16.920
<v Speaker 3>talk and they learned to play and all </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

752
00:38:16.921 --> 00:38:19.380
<v Speaker 3>and it destroys a certain amount of </v>
<v Speaker 3>individuality.</v>

753
00:38:19.620 --> 00:38:23.910
<v Speaker 3>So everybody sacrifices a certain </v>
<v Speaker 3>portion of their peculiarity to become a</v>

754
00:38:23.911 --> 00:38:28.911
<v Speaker 3>socialized creature and some of that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>good and some of it's bad and we know </v>

755
00:38:28.911 --> 00:38:28.911
<v Speaker 3>that that's.</v>

756
00:38:28.911 --> 00:38:33.410
<v Speaker 3>That's the standard story of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>rebellious Adolescent Against Society </v>

757
00:38:33.410 --> 00:38:34.380
<v Speaker 3>for crushing their individuality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

758
00:38:34.830 --> 00:38:35.970
<v Speaker 3>And there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's some,</v>

759
00:38:36.070 --> 00:38:41.070
<v Speaker 3>there's an element of that that's true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but by the same token,</v>

760
00:38:44.530 --> 00:38:49.530
<v Speaker 3>if you don't sacrifice a certain amount </v>
<v Speaker 3>of your individuality to the group,</v>

761
00:38:50.110 --> 00:38:52.990
<v Speaker 3>there's no such thing as society.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody has to live on their own.</v>

762
00:38:53.050 --> 00:38:54.970
<v Speaker 3>Everyone is in their own subjective </v>
<v Speaker 3>bubble,</v>

763
00:38:54.971 --> 00:38:59.971
<v Speaker 3>which is of course now required by this </v>
<v Speaker 3>law and society itself breaks down and </v>

764
00:38:59.971 --> 00:39:04.921
<v Speaker 3>so you can't have a society without </v>
<v Speaker 3>marginalizing people or you can't have a</v>

765
00:39:05.831 --> 00:39:09.400
<v Speaker 3>society without making everyone part of </v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone marginalized.</v>

766
00:39:09.401 --> 00:39:11.830
<v Speaker 3>And so then when you start to </v>
<v Speaker 3>concentrate on the marginalized,</v>

767
00:39:12.130 --> 00:39:17.130
<v Speaker 3>it just grows and expands and grows and </v>
<v Speaker 3>expands and grows and expand until </v>

768
00:39:17.130 --> 00:39:20.761
<v Speaker 3>everyone becomes marginalized.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that just highlights a real problem </v>

769
00:39:20.761 --> 00:39:25.561
<v Speaker 3>with quote mining that is going to take </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you can't have a society without </v>

770
00:39:25.561 --> 00:39:28.570
<v Speaker 3>marginalizing people quote and put it </v>
<v Speaker 3>under Dr Jordan Peterson.</v>

771
00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:30.430
<v Speaker 3>This is what he believes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

772
00:39:30.431 --> 00:39:33.050
<v Speaker 3>that's actually what Jacques Derrida's </v>
<v Speaker 3>said that the,</v>

773
00:39:33.090 --> 00:39:33.500
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

774
00:39:33.560 --> 00:39:36.460
<v Speaker 3>the most famous of the postmodernists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

775
00:39:36.490 --> 00:39:38.590
<v Speaker 3>that's why derrick is such a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

776
00:39:38.860 --> 00:39:41.050
<v Speaker 3>invasive force.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

777
00:39:41.051 --> 00:39:46.051
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't have a society without </v>

778
00:39:46.051 --> 00:39:46.051
<v Speaker 3>marginalizing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

779
00:39:46.051 --> 00:39:46.051
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's true.</v>

780
00:39:46.051 --> 00:39:47.050
<v Speaker 3>It's true comma,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but dot,</v>

781
00:39:47.100 --> 00:39:47.680
<v Speaker 3>dot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dot.</v>

782
00:39:47.710 --> 00:39:52.710
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the fact that you can't have a </v>

783
00:39:52.710 --> 00:39:54.160
<v Speaker 3>society without marginalizing doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>mean that you shouldn't have a society.</v>

784
00:39:54.310 --> 00:39:59.080
<v Speaker 3>And it doesn't mean that the only reason</v>
<v Speaker 3>that society exists is to marginalize.</v>

785
00:39:59.170 --> 00:40:04.170
<v Speaker 3>And that was at his claim that that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>what makes him so he's absolutely </v>

786
00:40:04.170 --> 00:40:05.890
<v Speaker 3>pathological to the core.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jacques Derrida,</v>

787
00:40:06.730 --> 00:40:10.660
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and apart from his claims that all we do</v>

788
00:40:10.661 --> 00:40:13.360
<v Speaker 3>is trade power games because that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>another one of his claims.</v>

789
00:40:13.630 --> 00:40:16.690
<v Speaker 3>His other claim is that the purpose of </v>
<v Speaker 3>categorization,</v>

790
00:40:16.691 --> 00:40:19.420
<v Speaker 3>the purchase purpose of society is to </v>
<v Speaker 3>marginalize.</v>

791
00:40:19.421 --> 00:40:23.860
<v Speaker 3>And that's absolutely absurd.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The purpose is so that we can all play a</v>

792
00:40:24.550 --> 00:40:29.440
<v Speaker 3>moderately mediocre but productive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>homogenous social game.</v>

793
00:40:29.830 --> 00:40:31.210
<v Speaker 3>Is it perfect?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

794
00:40:31.211 --> 00:40:36.211
<v Speaker 3>obviously not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does it require the sacrifice of </v>

795
00:40:36.211 --> 00:40:36.370
<v Speaker 3>individuality?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

796
00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:39.640
<v Speaker 3>Is some of that sacrificed individuality</v>
<v Speaker 3>valuable?</v>

797
00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:42.910
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the alternative?</v>

798
00:40:43.330 --> 00:40:46.510
<v Speaker 3>No society.</v>
<v Speaker 3>While I don't think so,</v>

799
00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:51.840
<v Speaker 3>that doesn't seem like a very good </v>
<v Speaker 3>alternative to me or maybe some sort of </v>

800
00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:53.980
<v Speaker 3>egalitarian utopia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well yeah,</v>

801
00:40:53.981 --> 00:40:58.981
<v Speaker 3>we had 100 years of that and 100 million</v>
<v Speaker 3>deaths as a consequence and so maybe not</v>

802
00:40:59.411 --> 00:41:04.411
<v Speaker 3>that either.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What we have right now is a flawed </v>

803
00:41:04.411 --> 00:41:07.231
<v Speaker 3>system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's the best flawed system that </v>

804
00:41:07.231 --> 00:41:08.710
<v Speaker 3>anybody's ever come up with and of </v>
<v Speaker 3>course it marginalizes people.</v>

805
00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:10.930
<v Speaker 3>How could it not?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

806
00:41:10.950 --> 00:41:15.950
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if kids organize themselves in a </v>

807
00:41:15.950 --> 00:41:17.761
<v Speaker 3>playground to play hide and go seek,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've marginalized all the kids that </v>

808
00:41:17.761 --> 00:41:21.661
<v Speaker 3>wanted to play tag obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that doesn't mean that they </v>

809
00:41:21.661 --> 00:41:23.800
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't come to a consensus and go </v>
<v Speaker 3>ahead and play a game.</v>

810
00:41:23.801 --> 00:41:25.550
<v Speaker 3>At least they're bloody while playing a </v>
<v Speaker 3>game that,</v>

811
00:41:25.620 --> 00:41:28.990
<v Speaker 3>that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty much everybody has access to.</v>

812
00:41:29.020 --> 00:41:33.410
<v Speaker 3>I think marginalized is a lot of times </v>
<v Speaker 3>associated with oppression that the term</v>

813
00:41:33.411 --> 00:41:34.070
<v Speaker 3>marginalized</v>

814
00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:39.070
<v Speaker 4>and it's not necessarily the case and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>think that society as a whole and </v>

815
00:41:39.070 --> 00:41:39.620
<v Speaker 4>civilization is sort of a work in </v>
<v Speaker 4>progress.</v>

816
00:41:39.621 --> 00:41:44.621
<v Speaker 4>We're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're working all this out and that's </v>

817
00:41:44.621 --> 00:41:47.081
<v Speaker 4>one of the beautiful things about you </v>
<v Speaker 4>being able to discuss these things on </v>

818
00:41:47.081 --> 00:41:50.051
<v Speaker 4>your youtube page as opposed to just </v>
<v Speaker 4>having to battle it out inside the echo </v>

819
00:41:50.271 --> 00:41:54.920
<v Speaker 4>chamber of the universities.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're able to express this stuff out in</v>

820
00:41:54.921 --> 00:41:59.921
<v Speaker 4>the world where people like me that a 49</v>
<v Speaker 4>years old and aren't in college have a </v>

821
00:41:59.921 --> 00:42:01.640
<v Speaker 4>chance to read this and see like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>

822
00:42:01.641 --> 00:42:04.970
<v Speaker 4>what is this guy going through over </v>
<v Speaker 4>there at the University of Toronto?</v>

823
00:42:05.090 --> 00:42:08.630
<v Speaker 4>And then you start to examine the laws </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you start to look at what's going on</v>

824
00:42:08.631 --> 00:42:13.040
<v Speaker 4>here and this egalitarianism utopia </v>
<v Speaker 4>idea.</v>

825
00:42:13.310 --> 00:42:18.310
<v Speaker 4>It's beautiful and it's concept that we </v>
<v Speaker 4>should all be able to get along and </v>

826
00:42:18.310 --> 00:42:20.180
<v Speaker 4>everything should be equal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The problem is it defies human nature.</v>

827
00:42:20.390 --> 00:42:23.390
<v Speaker 4>It defies the 200,</v>
<v Speaker 4>300,000</v>

828
00:42:23.391 --> 00:42:28.391
<v Speaker 4>years of DNA that we have bouncing </v>
<v Speaker 4>around inside of our bodies that demand </v>

829
00:42:29.750 --> 00:42:34.750
<v Speaker 4>certain types of behavior and I think </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's so important that we discuss these </v>

830
00:42:36.111 --> 00:42:38.900
<v Speaker 4>things and I think that society and </v>
<v Speaker 4>civilization as a whole,</v>

831
00:42:38.901 --> 00:42:43.901
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this thing that is ultimately in this </v>

832
00:42:43.901 --> 00:42:45.140
<v Speaker 4>growing state,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this constant state of improvement.</v>

833
00:42:45.150 --> 00:42:45.650
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

834
00:42:46.340 --> 00:42:50.030
<v Speaker 4>and objective interaction,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

835
00:42:50.031 --> 00:42:54.740
<v Speaker 4>there has to be some sort of discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of the problems that I have with the</v>

836
00:42:54.741 --> 00:42:59.741
<v Speaker 4>soda,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so called Social Justice warriors and </v>

837
00:42:59.741 --> 00:43:02.231
<v Speaker 4>what this movement is that they're in </v>
<v Speaker 4>forcing a certain type of thinking and </v>

838
00:43:02.231 --> 00:43:05.660
<v Speaker 4>behavior and their incredibly aggressive</v>
<v Speaker 4>about it.</v>

839
00:43:05.870 --> 00:43:06.320
<v Speaker 4>Hence the</v>

840
00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:07.820
<v Speaker 2>warrior term.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

841
00:43:07.821 --> 00:43:08.360
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

842
00:43:08.361 --> 00:43:11.660
<v Speaker 2>I think a fair bit of that is grounded </v>
<v Speaker 2>again in temperament,</v>

843
00:43:11.661 --> 00:43:13.100
<v Speaker 2>which is quite comical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

844
00:43:13.490 --> 00:43:18.490
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that our research </v>
<v Speaker 2>indicated research on political </v>

845
00:43:18.490 --> 00:43:21.671
<v Speaker 2>correctness indicated that his trait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>agreeableness is a good predictor of </v>

846
00:43:21.671 --> 00:43:25.751
<v Speaker 2>holding politically correct views and </v>
<v Speaker 2>also that being female is a good </v>

847
00:43:25.751 --> 00:43:26.540
<v Speaker 2>predictor of holding politically correct</v>
<v Speaker 2>views.</v>

848
00:43:27.050 --> 00:43:29.280
<v Speaker 2>And I think part of the reason for that </v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

849
00:43:29.281 --> 00:43:34.281
<v Speaker 2>and the warrior aspect to it too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that agreeableness is a maternal </v>

850
00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:37.070
<v Speaker 2>instinct trait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>roughly speaking.</v>

851
00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:40.490
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>human beings have very powerful maternal</v>

852
00:43:40.491 --> 00:43:45.491
<v Speaker 2>instincts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's true for women and for men </v>

853
00:43:45.491 --> 00:43:48.041
<v Speaker 2>because men are very involved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Male human beings are very involved in </v>

854
00:43:48.041 --> 00:43:49.680
<v Speaker 2>the raising of their children,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which makes them quite different than,</v>

855
00:43:49.820 --> 00:43:52.260
<v Speaker 2>than many large animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

856
00:43:53.510 --> 00:43:55.430
<v Speaker 2>on the one hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're a very maternal,</v>

857
00:43:55.730 --> 00:44:00.730
<v Speaker 2>you're very compassionate and protective</v>
<v Speaker 2>of those that are within your kin </v>

858
00:44:00.730 --> 00:44:04.610
<v Speaker 2>boundary and you can try to include more</v>
<v Speaker 2>people in that if you want.</v>

859
00:44:05.070 --> 00:44:05.780
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's,</v>

860
00:44:06.190 --> 00:44:11.190
<v Speaker 2>that's the political goal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're unbelievably hostile to </v>

861
00:44:11.190 --> 00:44:14.240
<v Speaker 2>anyone who's outside of that that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>regard as a threat slash predator.</v>

862
00:44:14.241 --> 00:44:17.300
<v Speaker 2>And so agreeableness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>agreeableness makes you divide the world</v>

863
00:44:17.301 --> 00:44:20.420
<v Speaker 2>up into protected children and Predator </v>
<v Speaker 2>and predators</v>

864
00:44:20.610 --> 00:44:23.160
<v Speaker 4>and you see that on social justice </v>
<v Speaker 4>warriors twitter pages.</v>

865
00:44:23.430 --> 00:44:28.430
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I follow a bunch of them and I go to </v>

866
00:44:28.430 --> 00:44:30.741
<v Speaker 4>them and I watched this ain't incredibly</v>
<v Speaker 4>supportive to ridiculously so in terms </v>

867
00:44:31.651 --> 00:44:32.080
<v Speaker 4>of like many</v>

868
00:44:32.130 --> 00:44:34.260
<v Speaker 3>mediocre expressions tweets,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

869
00:44:34.261 --> 00:44:39.261
<v Speaker 3>it's so brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's like you're saying almost </v>

870
00:44:39.261 --> 00:44:41.571
<v Speaker 3>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's so incredibly supportive of the </v>

871
00:44:41.571 --> 00:44:44.010
<v Speaker 3>people that think along their lines and </v>
<v Speaker 3>so incredibly hostile.</v>

872
00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:45.000
<v Speaker 3>And this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

873
00:44:45.020 --> 00:44:50.020
<v Speaker 3>this idea of shaming people that don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>agree with them not interacting with </v>

874
00:44:50.020 --> 00:44:51.450
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but almost immediately insulting them,</v>

875
00:44:51.660 --> 00:44:53.820
<v Speaker 3>almost immediately marginalized.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>

876
00:44:53.821 --> 00:44:57.600
<v Speaker 3>which is ironic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is what you see constantly,</v>

877
00:44:57.750 --> 00:45:02.750
<v Speaker 3>is like super supportive and super </v>
<v Speaker 3>aggressive against people that have any </v>

878
00:45:02.750 --> 00:45:04.110
<v Speaker 3>sort of an opposing viewpoint.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

879
00:45:04.170 --> 00:45:06.600
<v Speaker 3>they're all predators,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ones that have an opposing viewpoint</v>

880
00:45:06.900 --> 00:45:11.900
<v Speaker 3>and that's how they define them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the things that's very </v>

881
00:45:11.900 --> 00:45:14.031
<v Speaker 3>comical about this from my perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that it's such sex stereotypical </v>

882
00:45:14.031 --> 00:45:16.860
<v Speaker 3>behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that at the same time that the social</v>

883
00:45:16.861 --> 00:45:19.410
<v Speaker 3>justice warriors are denouncing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea that,</v>

884
00:45:19.930 --> 00:45:22.020
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>psychology for example,</v>

885
00:45:22.021 --> 00:45:23.820
<v Speaker 3>might have anything to do with sex </v>
<v Speaker 3>differences.</v>

886
00:45:23.820 --> 00:45:28.820
<v Speaker 3>They're acting out sex stereotype </v>
<v Speaker 3>behavior like mad in terms of their </v>

887
00:45:28.820 --> 00:45:29.640
<v Speaker 3>persecution of predators and their </v>
<v Speaker 3>protection of the,</v>

888
00:45:29.970 --> 00:45:33.960
<v Speaker 3>of the Qin Qin slash ingroup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

889
00:45:34.590 --> 00:45:35.320
<v Speaker 3>and you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are a,</v>

890
00:45:35.321 --> 00:45:37.190
<v Speaker 3>a social psychologist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

891
00:45:37.220 --> 00:45:37.710
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

892
00:45:37.711 --> 00:45:40.310
<v Speaker 3>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a clinical personality psychologist.</v>

893
00:45:40.311 --> 00:45:42.000
<v Speaker 3>And what is the difference?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

894
00:45:42.060 --> 00:45:47.060
<v Speaker 3>one of the differences is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>personality and so and clinical </v>

895
00:45:47.060 --> 00:45:50.301
<v Speaker 3>psychology isn't a corrupt enterprise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas social psychology fundamentally </v>

896
00:45:50.301 --> 00:45:54.231
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's been going through an absolute </v>

897
00:45:54.231 --> 00:45:54.830
<v Speaker 3>internal revolution over the last two </v>
<v Speaker 3>years because of all,</v>

898
00:45:54.870 --> 00:45:59.870
<v Speaker 3>because of its own discovery that many </v>
<v Speaker 3>of its fundamental studies in </v>

899
00:45:59.870 --> 00:46:03.200
<v Speaker 3>propositions are flawed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say social psychology is the </v>

900
00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:06.771
<v Speaker 3>most social justice slash left leaning </v>
<v Speaker 3>part of psychology and its methods are </v>

901
00:46:09.900 --> 00:46:14.900
<v Speaker 3>generally appalling there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not well documented and they </v>

902
00:46:14.900 --> 00:46:16.170
<v Speaker 3>produce all sorts of categories that </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't exist.</v>

903
00:46:16.560 --> 00:46:21.560
<v Speaker 3>Whereas personality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know it seems like it might seem like </v>

904
00:46:21.560 --> 00:46:21.560
<v Speaker 3>trivial distinction to people outside of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the field,</v>

905
00:46:21.560 --> 00:46:25.620
<v Speaker 3>but that these disciplines are quite </v>
<v Speaker 3>separate from a historical perspective.</v>

906
00:46:25.890 --> 00:46:29.160
<v Speaker 3>They developed quite separately.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Personality psychologists are very,</v>

907
00:46:29.161 --> 00:46:33.180
<v Speaker 3>very careful about defining what they </v>
<v Speaker 3>measure.</v>

908
00:46:33.540 --> 00:46:38.540
<v Speaker 3>And so for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I studied the big five personality </v>

909
00:46:38.540 --> 00:46:38.540
<v Speaker 3>traits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's extroversion,</v>

910
00:46:38.540 --> 00:46:38.910
<v Speaker 3>neuroticism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>agreeableness,</v>

911
00:46:38.911 --> 00:46:40.350
<v Speaker 3>conscientiousness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>openness,</v>

912
00:46:40.810 --> 00:46:42.840
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and under openness falls,</v>

913
00:46:42.841 --> 00:46:45.960
<v Speaker 3>intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these are very well documented.</v>

914
00:46:45.961 --> 00:46:50.961
<v Speaker 3>We can really measure them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can't measure them as well as we </v>

915
00:46:50.961 --> 00:46:53.541
<v Speaker 3>would like to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've identified the biological basis </v>

916
00:46:53.541 --> 00:46:56.780
<v Speaker 3>for most of the traits and we understand</v>
<v Speaker 3>a fair bit about how they make people </v>

917
00:46:57.211 --> 00:46:59.270
<v Speaker 3>different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

918
00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:04.760
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and personality psychologists have been </v>

919
00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:07.341
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very careful about measurement were </v>

920
00:47:07.341 --> 00:47:07.341
<v Speaker 3>social psychologists are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a general rule,</v>

921
00:47:07.341 --> 00:47:07.680
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very cavalier about their,</v>

922
00:47:08.100 --> 00:47:13.100
<v Speaker 3>about their concepts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's led to a tremendous </v>

923
00:47:13.100 --> 00:47:13.100
<v Speaker 3>pollution,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say,</v>

924
00:47:13.100 --> 00:47:17.511
<v Speaker 3>of the psychological literature.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The implicit association test is a good </v>

925
00:47:17.511 --> 00:47:20.901
<v Speaker 3>example of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the test that's being used to </v>

926
00:47:20.901 --> 00:47:22.320
<v Speaker 3>assess people's unconscious biases,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unconscious racial biases,</v>

927
00:47:22.321 --> 00:47:24.010
<v Speaker 3>and so for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

928
00:47:24.120 --> 00:47:29.120
<v Speaker 3>if I showed you a bunch of pictures of </v>
<v Speaker 3>black people in a bunch of photographs </v>

929
00:47:29.120 --> 00:47:33.441
<v Speaker 3>of white people and then I asked you to </v>
<v Speaker 3>associate a good or a bad word with the </v>

930
00:47:33.671 --> 00:47:36.910
<v Speaker 3>black people are the white people to </v>
<v Speaker 3>respond after you've seen the picture.</v>

931
00:47:37.540 --> 00:47:41.050
<v Speaker 3>If you are white and you saw white </v>
<v Speaker 3>photos,</v>

932
00:47:41.051 --> 00:47:46.051
<v Speaker 3>you'd be faster at responding to the to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the positive words and so they've used </v>

933
00:47:46.151 --> 00:47:51.151
<v Speaker 3>that as evidence of racism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But part of the problem with that is </v>

934
00:47:51.151 --> 00:47:52.990
<v Speaker 3>that you can't distinguish it from a </v>
<v Speaker 3>novelty response.</v>

935
00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:58.480
<v Speaker 3>So I mean most people in a given racial </v>
<v Speaker 3>group are far more familiar with members</v>

936
00:47:58.481 --> 00:48:03.481
<v Speaker 3>of their racial group and the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're more likely to associate </v>

937
00:48:03.481 --> 00:48:07.081
<v Speaker 3>negative things with racial groups that </v>
<v Speaker 3>are outside of their racial group isn't </v>

938
00:48:07.081 --> 00:48:10.771
<v Speaker 3>something that can be easily </v>
<v Speaker 3>distinguished from just a novelty </v>

939
00:48:10.771 --> 00:48:13.981
<v Speaker 3>effect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But they make wide ranging claims about </v>

940
00:48:13.981 --> 00:48:17.140
<v Speaker 3>the inbuilt biases in people and also.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's lent.</v>

941
00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:22.200
<v Speaker 3>And that's lent a impetus to these </v>
<v Speaker 3>movements that are racing through </v>

942
00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:26.461
<v Speaker 3>corporations across the United States </v>
<v Speaker 3>and governmental agencies where people </v>

943
00:48:26.461 --> 00:48:29.890
<v Speaker 3>are being subjected to mandatory </v>
<v Speaker 3>unconscious racial bias retraining.</v>

944
00:48:30.040 --> 00:48:31.480
<v Speaker 3>And there's no evidence by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

945
00:48:31.481 --> 00:48:32.770
<v Speaker 3>that works at all.</v>

946
00:48:32.800 --> 00:48:34.960
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the evidence that there is suggest quite</v>

947
00:48:34.961 --> 00:48:37.390
<v Speaker 3>the contrary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw this on one of your videos.</v>

948
00:48:37.590 --> 00:48:38.080
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were,</v>

949
00:48:38.170 --> 00:48:43.170
<v Speaker 3>you were discussing how preposterous </v>
<v Speaker 3>this is on one of your videos because </v>

950
00:48:43.170 --> 00:48:46.231
<v Speaker 3>one of the people that was opposing you </v>
<v Speaker 3>was actually a part of something like </v>

951
00:48:46.231 --> 00:48:46.231
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

952
00:48:46.231 --> 00:48:46.231
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

953
00:48:46.231 --> 00:48:50.851
<v Speaker 3>the human resources and equity people at</v>
<v Speaker 3>the University of Toronto have made </v>

954
00:48:50.851 --> 00:48:55.381
<v Speaker 3>mandatory unconscious racism training,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anti bias training,</v>

955
00:48:55.910 --> 00:48:57.790
<v Speaker 3>and they've made it mandatory for their </v>
<v Speaker 3>staff.</v>

956
00:48:58.600 --> 00:49:00.640
<v Speaker 3>And I found that absolutely appalling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>

957
00:49:00.641 --> 00:49:02.920
<v Speaker 3>it's political.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's political reeducation.</v>

958
00:49:02.921 --> 00:49:07.921
<v Speaker 3>So when you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but mandatory like this is something </v>

959
00:49:07.921 --> 00:49:07.921
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

960
00:49:07.921 --> 00:49:11.010
<v Speaker 3>I didn't have to because I'm not a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not part of the human resources </v>

961
00:49:11.010 --> 00:49:14.131
<v Speaker 3>staff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the people that they're consulting </v>

962
00:49:14.131 --> 00:49:16.981
<v Speaker 3>with to implement these sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 3>programs certainly have faculty and </v>

963
00:49:16.981 --> 00:49:17.380
<v Speaker 3>students in their sites.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

964
00:49:17.381 --> 00:49:19.720
<v Speaker 3>these are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these are trial runs for much broader,</v>

965
00:49:19.780 --> 00:49:22.480
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rolling out of exactly this sort of,</v>

966
00:49:23.050 --> 00:49:25.510
<v Speaker 3>of exactly this sort of a reeducation.</v>

967
00:49:25.510 --> 00:49:28.650
<v Speaker 3>What's the methodology behind it and how</v>
<v Speaker 3>has this been,</v>

968
00:49:28.820 --> 00:49:30.640
<v Speaker 3>has been vetted?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

969
00:49:30.641 --> 00:49:34.450
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's been vetted at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The like if you're going to,</v>

970
00:49:34.690 --> 00:49:36.190
<v Speaker 3>let's say you want to put in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

971
00:49:36.430 --> 00:49:41.430
<v Speaker 3>into practice and educational process,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you need to do is you need to </v>

972
00:49:41.430 --> 00:49:44.480
<v Speaker 3>measure the initial state validly so </v>
<v Speaker 3>that your measure,</v>

973
00:49:44.481 --> 00:49:49.481
<v Speaker 3>so you need to use multiple measures and</v>
<v Speaker 3>all those measures need to say the same </v>

974
00:49:49.481 --> 00:49:52.951
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you're going to accuse someone of </v>

975
00:49:52.951 --> 00:49:55.021
<v Speaker 3>racism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you need several different measures of </v>

976
00:49:55.021 --> 00:49:55.450
<v Speaker 3>racism and then you have to show that </v>
<v Speaker 3>across all the measures.</v>

977
00:49:55.630 --> 00:50:00.630
<v Speaker 3>So like using different meters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the meters should read the same </v>

978
00:50:00.630 --> 00:50:03.841
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you have to implement your </v>

979
00:50:03.841 --> 00:50:03.850
<v Speaker 3>educational intervention carefully </v>
<v Speaker 3>defined.</v>

980
00:50:04.030 --> 00:50:04.930
<v Speaker 3>Then you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do,</v>

981
00:50:05.110 --> 00:50:10.110
<v Speaker 3>you have to see afterwards if the </v>
<v Speaker 3>consequence of the educational effort </v>

982
00:50:10.360 --> 00:50:13.080
<v Speaker 3>was a reduction in those initial,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

983
00:50:14.110 --> 00:50:15.850
<v Speaker 3>indices,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those additional measures,</v>

984
00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:18.640
<v Speaker 3>that sort of thing when it's been done </v>
<v Speaker 3>at all,</v>

985
00:50:18.641 --> 00:50:23.641
<v Speaker 3>has showed that educational </v>
<v Speaker 3>interventions of that sort that are </v>

986
00:50:23.641 --> 00:50:25.360
<v Speaker 3>mandatory actually make racism and bias </v>
<v Speaker 3>worse rather than better.</v>

987
00:50:25.750 --> 00:50:30.750
<v Speaker 3>But why let a few facts stop you because</v>
<v Speaker 3>we already know from the postmodernists </v>

988
00:50:30.750 --> 00:50:32.000
<v Speaker 3>that there's no such thing as facts </v>
<v Speaker 3>anyways.</v>

989
00:50:33.650 --> 00:50:38.650
<v Speaker 3>So there's skin Canada here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's something is one of the things </v>

990
00:50:38.650 --> 00:50:39.740
<v Speaker 3>that really makes me proud of my </v>
<v Speaker 3>country.</v>

991
00:50:40.670 --> 00:50:45.670
<v Speaker 3>Our government has now announced that </v>
<v Speaker 3>the judiciary in Canada will be </v>

992
00:50:45.670 --> 00:50:50.201
<v Speaker 3>selected.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're going to be a candidate to be </v>

993
00:50:50.201 --> 00:50:52.691
<v Speaker 3>a judge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to produce a dossier that </v>

994
00:50:52.691 --> 00:50:52.691
<v Speaker 3>specifies your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your identities,</v>

995
00:50:52.691 --> 00:50:54.320
<v Speaker 3>whatever they happen to be racial,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ethnic,</v>

996
00:50:54.321 --> 00:50:57.200
<v Speaker 3>religious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you,</v>

997
00:50:57.670 --> 00:51:02.670
<v Speaker 3>the committee that's going to appoint </v>
<v Speaker 3>you to the judiciary has to have </v>

998
00:51:02.670 --> 00:51:05.270
<v Speaker 3>undergone mandatory anti racism and bias</v>
<v Speaker 3>training before they're allowed to serve</v>

999
00:51:05.271 --> 00:51:08.540
<v Speaker 3>on the committee.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So basically we've set up a situation in</v>

1000
00:51:08.541 --> 00:51:13.541
<v Speaker 3>Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where are the people who select their </v>

1001
00:51:13.541 --> 00:51:16.661
<v Speaker 3>judges have to go a kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>indoctrination that has no validity from</v>

1002
00:51:16.851 --> 00:51:19.940
<v Speaker 3>a scientific perspective before they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>allowed to select our judges.</v>

1003
00:51:20.180 --> 00:51:23.300
<v Speaker 3>Now who's enforcing this where to </v>
<v Speaker 3>justice minister,</v>

1004
00:51:23.390 --> 00:51:26.570
<v Speaker 3>but where justice minister,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where did this program come from?</v>

1005
00:51:27.110 --> 00:51:28.700
<v Speaker 3>All sorts of people who have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who are,</v>

1006
00:51:28.701 --> 00:51:32.060
<v Speaker 3>who are offering these programs now and </v>
<v Speaker 3>so we've come a growth industry,</v>

1007
00:51:32.120 --> 00:51:35.660
<v Speaker 3>but what is their qualifications?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a good question,</v>

1008
00:51:35.661 --> 00:51:37.070
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Qualifications,</v>

1009
00:51:37.130 --> 00:51:39.740
<v Speaker 3>zero browser rains.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1010
00:51:39.741 --> 00:51:44.741
<v Speaker 3>Well there's just no way of having </v>
<v Speaker 3>qualifications for doing this sort of </v>

1011
00:51:44.741 --> 00:51:44.990
<v Speaker 3>thing because it's not a valid </v>
<v Speaker 3>procedure.</v>

1012
00:51:44.991 --> 00:51:49.070
<v Speaker 3>So how does he claim to be qualified?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they claim to be qualified.</v>

1013
00:51:49.071 --> 00:51:50.270
<v Speaker 3>They come to the university and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

1014
00:51:50.271 --> 00:51:55.271
<v Speaker 3>I have a solution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The university says finally just run </v>

1015
00:51:55.271 --> 00:51:58.151
<v Speaker 3>with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they just implemented because to </v>

1016
00:51:58.151 --> 00:51:59.270
<v Speaker 3>question anything that would absolve.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Racism is racist.</v>

1017
00:51:59.330 --> 00:51:59.990
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1018
00:52:00.530 --> 00:52:05.530
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they did that in collaboration with </v>

1019
00:52:05.530 --> 00:52:06.190
<v Speaker 3>the black liberation collective,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is police that one because that,</v>

1020
00:52:06.210 --> 00:52:11.210
<v Speaker 3>that one's adorable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The black liberation collective isn't </v>

1021
00:52:11.210 --> 00:52:11.210
<v Speaker 3>that?</v>

1022
00:52:11.210 --> 00:52:14.860
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that the group that somehow things</v>
<v Speaker 3>that white people are inferior because </v>

1023
00:52:14.860 --> 00:52:18.341
<v Speaker 3>they don't have enough melanin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it was started by a woman who said </v>

1024
00:52:18.341 --> 00:52:22.661
<v Speaker 3>exactly that she's a black supremacist </v>
<v Speaker 3>and she said that the reason that the </v>

1025
00:52:22.661 --> 00:52:26.980
<v Speaker 3>reason that white people are inferior </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they don't have enough melanin </v>

1026
00:52:26.980 --> 00:52:27.980
<v Speaker 3>in their skin and Melanin apparently is </v>
<v Speaker 3>this agent.</v>

1027
00:52:27.981 --> 00:52:32.981
<v Speaker 3>It's obviously it's a pigment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's apparently this agent that </v>

1028
00:52:32.981 --> 00:52:35.060
<v Speaker 3>transforms cosmic energy into wisdom </v>
<v Speaker 3>mean she's completely.</v>

1029
00:52:36.500 --> 00:52:38.750
<v Speaker 3>You can make.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can make up your own mind about her.</v>

1030
00:52:38.751 --> 00:52:43.751
<v Speaker 3>And then the other person who started </v>
<v Speaker 3>the black liberation collective is a </v>

1031
00:52:43.751 --> 00:52:45.770
<v Speaker 3>woman who used to work for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>University of Toronto Students Union who</v>

1032
00:52:46.280 --> 00:52:50.640
<v Speaker 3>is now being pursued by that student's </v>
<v Speaker 3>Union for embezzling $300,000</v>

1033
00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:52.040
<v Speaker 3>of from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from,</v>

1034
00:52:52.100 --> 00:52:54.830
<v Speaker 3>from that organization with the help of </v>
<v Speaker 3>a couple of her cronies.</v>

1035
00:52:55.130 --> 00:53:00.130
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why let a few facts stand in the way of </v>

1036
00:53:00.130 --> 00:53:00.130
<v Speaker 3>abolishing racism?</v>

1037
00:53:00.130 --> 00:53:00.130
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1038
00:53:00.130 --> 00:53:04.271
<v Speaker 3>they also.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They also are perfectly willing to </v>

1039
00:53:04.271 --> 00:53:05.960
<v Speaker 3>promote violent means of social </v>
<v Speaker 3>transformation and the university claims</v>

1040
00:53:05.961 --> 00:53:07.950
<v Speaker 3>that it's in favor of safety,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1041
00:53:07.960 --> 00:53:12.960
<v Speaker 3>because they've gone after me because my</v>
<v Speaker 3>refusal to use compelled pronouns is </v>

1042
00:53:12.960 --> 00:53:16.871
<v Speaker 3>apparently made the campus unsafe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're perfectly willing to take </v>

1043
00:53:16.871 --> 00:53:19.130
<v Speaker 3>advice from the black liberation </v>
<v Speaker 3>collective and not only are they willing</v>

1044
00:53:19.131 --> 00:53:24.131
<v Speaker 3>to take advice from them and not disavow</v>
<v Speaker 3>them despite their support for violent </v>

1045
00:53:24.591 --> 00:53:28.590
<v Speaker 3>means of of social revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're also pushing equality of outcome</v>

1046
00:53:28.591 --> 00:53:33.591
<v Speaker 3>on their employees and the people who </v>
<v Speaker 3>taught there mandatory anti racism and </v>

1047
00:53:33.591 --> 00:53:35.580
<v Speaker 3>anti bias training program said outright</v>
<v Speaker 3>in their training material,</v>

1048
00:53:35.581 --> 00:53:40.581
<v Speaker 3>which I have copies of that any </v>
<v Speaker 3>institution that doesn't have equality </v>

1049
00:53:41.011 --> 00:53:46.011
<v Speaker 3>of outcome as as part of its </v>
<v Speaker 3>characteristic at every level of the </v>

1050
00:53:46.011 --> 00:53:47.520
<v Speaker 3>power organization is corrupt and should</v>
<v Speaker 3>be restructured.</v>

1051
00:53:50.420 --> 00:53:54.170
<v Speaker 3>But that pales in comparison to my </v>
<v Speaker 3>refusal to use compelled pronouns.</v>

1052
00:53:54.171 --> 00:53:57.120
<v Speaker 3>Like obviously don't understand how this</v>
<v Speaker 3>gets so far.</v>

1053
00:53:57.121 --> 00:54:02.121
<v Speaker 3>I just don't understand how no one has.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no rational thinking involved in</v>

1054
00:54:03.570 --> 00:54:08.570
<v Speaker 3>the administration and the and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>people that are implementing these </v>

1055
00:54:08.570 --> 00:54:11.211
<v Speaker 3>ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just don't understand how it gets to </v>

1056
00:54:11.211 --> 00:54:11.370
<v Speaker 3>the point where things get too terrible </v>
<v Speaker 3>places.</v>

1057
00:54:11.580 --> 00:54:14.010
<v Speaker 3>One tiny step at a time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1058
00:54:14.011 --> 00:54:19.011
<v Speaker 3>if I encroach I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I encroach on you and I'm </v>

1059
00:54:19.011 --> 00:54:19.350
<v Speaker 3>sophisticated about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to encroach two millimeters.</v>

1060
00:54:19.410 --> 00:54:21.630
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to encroach right to the point</v>
<v Speaker 3>where you start,</v>

1061
00:54:21.720 --> 00:54:23.580
<v Speaker 3>start to protest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then I'm going to stop,</v>

1062
00:54:23.970 --> 00:54:26.550
<v Speaker 3>then I'm going to wait.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you're going to calm down.</v>

1063
00:54:26.580 --> 00:54:30.060
<v Speaker 3>Then I'm going to encroach again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right to the point where you protest.</v>

1064
00:54:30.210 --> 00:54:32.070
<v Speaker 3>Then I'm going to stop,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then I'm going to wait,</v>

1065
00:54:32.340 --> 00:54:34.470
<v Speaker 3>and I'm just going to do that forever.</v>

1066
00:54:34.620 --> 00:54:37.710
<v Speaker 3>And before you know it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to be back three miles from</v>

1067
00:54:37.711 --> 00:54:42.711
<v Speaker 3>where you started and you'll have done </v>
<v Speaker 3>it one step at a time and then you'll </v>

1068
00:54:42.711 --> 00:54:42.711
<v Speaker 3>go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1069
00:54:42.711 --> 00:54:43.140
<v Speaker 3>how'd I get here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the answer was,</v>

1070
00:54:43.141 --> 00:54:48.141
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I pushed you a little farther than you </v>

1071
00:54:48.141 --> 00:54:48.141
<v Speaker 3>should have gone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you agreed,</v>

1072
00:54:48.141 --> 00:54:50.760
<v Speaker 3>and so then I pushed you a little </v>
<v Speaker 3>farther than you should've gone again.</v>

1073
00:54:50.790 --> 00:54:53.640
<v Speaker 3>And you agreed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if anybody's interested in this sort</v>

1074
00:54:53.641 --> 00:54:55.710
<v Speaker 3>of process,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is a horrifying book,</v>

1075
00:54:55.711 --> 00:54:57.780
<v Speaker 3>if you want to read about how this </v>
<v Speaker 3>process works,</v>

1076
00:54:57.781 --> 00:55:02.781
<v Speaker 3>you can read a book called ordinary men </v>
<v Speaker 3>by Robert Browning in ordinary men is </v>

1077
00:55:02.821 --> 00:55:07.080
<v Speaker 3>about browning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was interested in how the Nazis trained.</v>

1078
00:55:07.081 --> 00:55:09.010
<v Speaker 3>They're there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're there,</v>

1079
00:55:09.220 --> 00:55:12.060
<v Speaker 3>they how they train people to kill </v>
<v Speaker 3>basically.</v>

1080
00:55:12.061 --> 00:55:14.980
<v Speaker 3>And so Robert Browning studied this </v>
<v Speaker 3>police battalion.</v>

1081
00:55:14.981 --> 00:55:19.500
<v Speaker 3>It's very interesting book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So these were middle aged German men.</v>

1082
00:55:19.590 --> 00:55:20.670
<v Speaker 3>So they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were,</v>

1083
00:55:21.060 --> 00:55:23.970
<v Speaker 3>they were raised and educated really </v>
<v Speaker 3>before Hitler came to power.</v>

1084
00:55:23.970 --> 00:55:28.970
<v Speaker 3>So they weren't indoctrinated Nazis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were policemen and when the Nazis </v>

1085
00:55:28.970 --> 00:55:32.910
<v Speaker 3>went through Poland and then and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>needed to impose their brand of order on</v>

1086
00:55:32.940 --> 00:55:37.940
<v Speaker 3>Poland,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they brought policemen and they brought </v>

1087
00:55:37.940 --> 00:55:40.041
<v Speaker 3>this battalion of middle aged policemen </v>
<v Speaker 3>in and they're commandant.</v>

1088
00:55:40.470 --> 00:55:44.310
<v Speaker 3>Their commander was by all accounts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a pretty decent guy.</v>

1089
00:55:44.311 --> 00:55:46.500
<v Speaker 3>And he told them that because it was war</v>
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>

1090
00:55:46.501 --> 00:55:48.690
<v Speaker 3>they were probably going to have to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>some pretty terrible things,</v>

1091
00:55:48.900 --> 00:55:51.300
<v Speaker 3>but that they could go home if they </v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't think they were up to it.</v>

1092
00:55:51.930 --> 00:55:53.370
<v Speaker 3>So there was no compulsion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1093
00:55:53.371 --> 00:55:58.371
<v Speaker 3>this wasn't a milgrim experiment or or </v>
<v Speaker 3>an experiment where you had to obey </v>

1094
00:55:58.371 --> 00:55:59.340
<v Speaker 3>orders.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The guy who was giving the artist said,</v>

1095
00:55:59.341 --> 00:56:00.360
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is going to be awful,</v>

1096
00:56:00.361 --> 00:56:02.040
<v Speaker 3>but you can back off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the guys thought,</v>

1097
00:56:02.041 --> 00:56:07.041
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to leave my comrades here </v>

1098
00:56:07.041 --> 00:56:07.041
<v Speaker 3>to do the dirty work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1099
00:56:07.041 --> 00:56:08.280
<v Speaker 3>which is kind of a virtue in in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>perverse way.</v>

1100
00:56:09.210 --> 00:56:13.080
<v Speaker 3>And then Browning details how they went </v>
<v Speaker 3>from ordinary policeman to guys who were</v>

1101
00:56:13.081 --> 00:56:18.081
<v Speaker 3>taking naked pregnant women out into the</v>
<v Speaker 3>middle of fields and shooting them in </v>

1102
00:56:18.081 --> 00:56:21.231
<v Speaker 3>the back of their head and they were </v>
<v Speaker 3>physically ill during most of the </v>

1103
00:56:21.231 --> 00:56:21.780
<v Speaker 3>transformation process.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1104
00:56:21.781 --> 00:56:26.781
<v Speaker 3>they started out by what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rounding up the Jewish men between the </v>

1105
00:56:26.781 --> 00:56:27.820
<v Speaker 3>ages of 16 and 65,</v>
<v Speaker 3>while you know,</v>

1106
00:56:27.821 --> 00:56:29.980
<v Speaker 3>you can kind of understand that because </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're at war and then,</v>

1107
00:56:29.981 --> 00:56:31.660
<v Speaker 3>well then they put them in stadiums and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then,</v>

1108
00:56:31.930 --> 00:56:33.280
<v Speaker 3>well then they had to shoot some of </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

1109
00:56:33.281 --> 00:56:34.960
<v Speaker 3>Then they had to load them on cattle </v>
<v Speaker 3>cars.</v>

1110
00:56:34.961 --> 00:56:39.961
<v Speaker 3>It was like one step at a time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These guys were having a dreadful time </v>

1111
00:56:39.961 --> 00:56:39.961
<v Speaker 3>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They didn't stop.</v>

1112
00:56:40.960 --> 00:56:45.960
<v Speaker 3>They didn't stop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that's how things get to where </v>

1113
00:56:45.960 --> 00:56:45.960
<v Speaker 3>they are now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that,</v>

1114
00:56:45.960 --> 00:56:47.410
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know they're not at that point and I'm</v>

1115
00:56:47.411 --> 00:56:49.540
<v Speaker 3>not trying to make the case that they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>at that point.</v>

1116
00:56:49.600 --> 00:56:54.600
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're one of the first people that </v>

1117
00:56:54.600 --> 00:56:55.741
<v Speaker 3>sounding an alarm that there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a real issue with controlling </v>

1118
00:56:55.741 --> 00:56:58.861
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a real issue with controlling </v>

1119
00:56:58.861 --> 00:57:01.111
<v Speaker 3>dialogue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>controlling the way people communicate </v>

1120
00:57:01.111 --> 00:57:02.650
<v Speaker 3>and that these ideologies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>although seemingly innocuous,</v>

1121
00:57:02.860 --> 00:57:04.790
<v Speaker 3>they can take you down very dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 3>roads.</v>

1122
00:57:04.800 --> 00:57:05.350
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1123
00:57:05.380 --> 00:57:08.950
<v Speaker 3>seemingly innocuous ideology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those words,</v>

1124
00:57:09.190 --> 00:57:12.010
<v Speaker 3>innocuous ideology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those words do not go together.</v>

1125
00:57:12.070 --> 00:57:17.070
<v Speaker 3>There are no innocuous ideologies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there are forms of pathological </v>

1126
00:57:17.070 --> 00:57:18.670
<v Speaker 3>oversimplification and there are also </v>
<v Speaker 3>clubs.</v>

1127
00:57:18.671 --> 00:57:23.671
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the kind of clubs that you hit </v>

1128
00:57:23.671 --> 00:57:23.671
<v Speaker 3>people with as well as the clubs that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you belong to.</v>

1129
00:57:23.830 --> 00:57:27.670
<v Speaker 3>The advantage to me being an idiot log </v>
<v Speaker 3>is that I can explain everything.</v>

1130
00:57:28.540 --> 00:57:32.320
<v Speaker 3>I can feel morally superior and I know </v>
<v Speaker 3>who my enemies are.</v>

1131
00:57:33.220 --> 00:57:35.110
<v Speaker 3>And you know what you're supposed to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>with enemies.</v>

1132
00:57:35.980 --> 00:57:37.300
<v Speaker 3>They're not your friends,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1133
00:57:37.301 --> 00:57:39.370
<v Speaker 3>You move against them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

1134
00:57:39.371 --> 00:57:42.040
<v Speaker 3>we're approaching a situation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this has already happened,</v>

1135
00:57:42.041 --> 00:57:44.020
<v Speaker 3>I think more in the United States than </v>
<v Speaker 3>in Canada,</v>

1136
00:57:44.021 --> 00:57:49.021
<v Speaker 3>although our countries are competing to </v>
<v Speaker 3>see who can cross the idiot line </v>

1137
00:57:49.021 --> 00:57:49.021
<v Speaker 3>fastest.</v>

1138
00:57:49.470 --> 00:57:51.940
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're in a situation in the US where 50</v>

1139
00:57:51.941 --> 00:57:54.940
<v Speaker 3>percent of your population won't talk to</v>
<v Speaker 3>the other 50 percent.</v>

1140
00:57:55.630 --> 00:58:00.630
<v Speaker 3>That's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I would say it's more pronounced on </v>

1141
00:58:00.630 --> 00:58:03.241
<v Speaker 3>the left liberal side because they </v>
<v Speaker 3>regard everybody who voted for trump as </v>

1142
00:58:03.241 --> 00:58:03.280
<v Speaker 3>essentially as an enemy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1143
00:58:03.281 --> 00:58:06.340
<v Speaker 3>hey people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's 50 percent of your citizens.</v>

1144
00:58:06.460 --> 00:58:09.930
<v Speaker 3>You might think about talking with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1145
00:58:10.900 --> 00:58:13.030
<v Speaker 3>people you can't talk to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are enemies.</v>

1146
00:58:13.210 --> 00:58:18.210
<v Speaker 3>My ironically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really truly believe that one of the </v>

1147
00:58:18.210 --> 00:58:20.970
<v Speaker 3>big factors in trump's rise to power is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that people are sick of this </v>

1148
00:58:20.970 --> 00:58:25.160
<v Speaker 3>oversimplification in this ridiculous </v>
<v Speaker 3>ideology coming from the left like that.</v>

1149
00:58:25.161 --> 00:58:27.820
<v Speaker 3>This combined entity politic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

1150
00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:33.000
<v Speaker 3>And so they've chosen an identity </v>
<v Speaker 3>politics that opposes the identity </v>

1151
00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:35.060
<v Speaker 3>politics that they think is disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1152
00:58:35.080 --> 00:58:37.650
<v Speaker 3>And that's just starting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just just start.</v>

1153
00:58:37.920 --> 00:58:38.500
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1154
00:58:38.501 --> 00:58:43.501
<v Speaker 3>if you teach,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you teach one side to play identity </v>

1155
00:58:43.501 --> 00:58:43.501
<v Speaker 3>politics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>defacto,</v>

1156
00:58:43.501 --> 00:58:45.190
<v Speaker 3>you teach the other side to play </v>
<v Speaker 3>identity politics,</v>

1157
00:58:45.490 --> 00:58:50.490
<v Speaker 3>and I've seen more and more people who </v>
<v Speaker 3>are center people as far as I'm </v>

1158
00:58:50.490 --> 00:58:54.211
<v Speaker 3>concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pushed to the right because of the </v>

1159
00:58:54.211 --> 00:58:54.211
<v Speaker 3>continual insistence that by their mere </v>
<v Speaker 3>existence,</v>

1160
00:58:54.211 --> 00:58:59.071
<v Speaker 3>they're part of the perpetrator group </v>
<v Speaker 3>just by being a white person who is </v>

1161
00:58:59.071 --> 00:59:00.940
<v Speaker 3>somehow or another successful.</v>

1162
00:59:01.150 --> 00:59:04.510
<v Speaker 3>You are a privileged person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're part of the elite.</v>

1163
00:59:04.540 --> 00:59:07.030
<v Speaker 3>You're part of the one percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're a part of the problem.</v>

1164
00:59:07.120 --> 00:59:08.650
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're part of the oppressors.</v>

1165
00:59:08.880 --> 00:59:09.760
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>

1166
00:59:09.761 --> 00:59:14.530
<v Speaker 3>Or an oppressor by being just to just by</v>
<v Speaker 3>a person with a home in the suburbs.</v>

1167
00:59:14.590 --> 00:59:19.590
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's also extremely annoying for </v>

1168
00:59:19.590 --> 00:59:21.631
<v Speaker 3>people who've worked really hard and </v>
<v Speaker 3>who've made the requisite sacrifices to </v>

1169
00:59:21.631 --> 00:59:22.220
<v Speaker 3>become along some</v>

1170
00:59:22.220 --> 00:59:27.220
<v Speaker 2>dimension,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to have that immediately attributed to </v>

1171
00:59:27.220 --> 00:59:30.011
<v Speaker 2>their oppression and it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not obvious that that's something </v>

1172
00:59:30.011 --> 00:59:31.550
<v Speaker 2>we want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like for the social justice warrior</v>

1173
00:59:31.551 --> 00:59:34.280
<v Speaker 2>types out there who might be listening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

1174
00:59:34.281 --> 00:59:36.770
<v Speaker 2>do you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you really willing to say that every</v>

1175
00:59:36.771 --> 00:59:41.771
<v Speaker 2>single person who's accomplished </v>
<v Speaker 2>something as done that as a consequence </v>

1176
00:59:41.771 --> 00:59:45.431
<v Speaker 2>of oppression,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that's again what the Soviets </v>

1177
00:59:45.431 --> 00:59:46.370
<v Speaker 2>claimed with regards to the to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>successful peasants in the 19,</v>

1178
00:59:46.700 --> 00:59:48.920
<v Speaker 2>in the just before the 19 twenties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1179
00:59:49.220 --> 00:59:51.410
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the peasants weren't emancipated.</v>

1180
00:59:51.411 --> 00:59:54.570
<v Speaker 2>They were serfs until about 30 years </v>
<v Speaker 2>before that they were serfs.</v>

1181
00:59:54.680 --> 00:59:58.730
<v Speaker 2>They were basically slaves and some of </v>
<v Speaker 2>them had clambered up to the point where</v>

1182
00:59:58.731 --> 01:00:02.810
<v Speaker 2>maybe they could have owned their hot </v>
<v Speaker 2>and a cow and you don't employ somewhat.</v>

1183
01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:04.700
<v Speaker 2>While the Soviet claim was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1184
01:00:04.730 --> 01:00:09.730
<v Speaker 2>that's all theft.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got that all because you're an </v>

1185
01:00:09.730 --> 01:00:09.730
<v Speaker 2>oppressor.</v>

1186
01:00:09.730 --> 01:00:12.910
<v Speaker 2>And so then the Soviet intellectuals </v>
<v Speaker 2>went into the villages and just imagine </v>

1187
01:00:12.910 --> 01:00:13.340
<v Speaker 2>how this happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So imagine a village,</v>

1188
01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:17.210
<v Speaker 2>small town where everyone knows </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody and there's maybe 10,</v>

1189
01:00:17.211 --> 01:00:19.520
<v Speaker 2>20 people there who are moderately </v>
<v Speaker 2>successful.</v>

1190
01:00:19.820 --> 01:00:24.820
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you can imagine that those 20 </v>

1191
01:00:24.820 --> 01:00:26.651
<v Speaker 2>people have like a 100 enemies at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bottom of the socioeconomic </v>

1192
01:00:26.651 --> 01:00:26.990
<v Speaker 2>distribution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Useless,</v>

1193
01:00:27.050 --> 01:00:32.050
<v Speaker 2>horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People who are jealous and resentful </v>

1194
01:00:32.050 --> 01:00:32.050
<v Speaker 2>about the fact that these people have </v>
<v Speaker 2>been successful.</v>

1195
01:00:32.050 --> 01:00:33.890
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now the intellectuals come in and say</v>

1196
01:00:34.130 --> 01:00:36.830
<v Speaker 2>property is theft,</v>
<v Speaker 2>success is oppression,</v>

1197
01:00:37.130 --> 01:00:42.130
<v Speaker 2>and then they looked for the people in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the village who are willing to move </v>

1198
01:00:42.130 --> 01:00:44.210
<v Speaker 2>against those 20 successful people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well those guys at the bottom,</v>

1199
01:00:44.211 --> 01:00:46.580
<v Speaker 2>those hundred resentful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>jealous,</v>

1200
01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:51.640
<v Speaker 2>murderous people at the bottom there </v>
<v Speaker 2>just waiting for an opportunity to go </v>

1201
01:00:51.640 --> 01:00:55.181
<v Speaker 2>kick down some doors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's exactly what they did in the </v>

1202
01:00:55.181 --> 01:00:55.181
<v Speaker 2>19 twenties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as I said,</v>

1203
01:00:55.181 --> 01:00:59.261
<v Speaker 2>they wiped out all their productive </v>
<v Speaker 2>peasants and then 6 million Ukrainian </v>

1204
01:00:59.261 --> 01:00:59.840
<v Speaker 2>starve to death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had posters.</v>

1205
01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:04.070
<v Speaker 2>The Soviets produced posters in the 19 </v>
<v Speaker 2>thirties that said essentially,</v>

1206
01:01:04.290 --> 01:01:09.290
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't forget it's wrong to eat your </v>

1207
01:01:09.290 --> 01:01:09.290
<v Speaker 2>children.</v>

1208
01:01:09.980 --> 01:01:11.810
<v Speaker 2>So whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1209
01:01:11.811 --> 01:01:15.740
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing about the Soviet,</v>

1210
01:01:15.890 --> 01:01:20.890
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing that you can imagine </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's horrible enough so that it </v>

1211
01:01:20.890 --> 01:01:23.720
<v Speaker 2>matched the reality of what happened in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Soviet Union between 19,</v>

1212
01:01:23.721 --> 01:01:26.330
<v Speaker 2>19 in 1959.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1213
01:01:26.331 --> 01:01:31.331
<v Speaker 2>the West knew about this too early.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Malcolm Muggeridge in the thirties was </v>

1214
01:01:31.331 --> 01:01:31.580
<v Speaker 2>documenting for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for England,</v>

1215
01:01:31.581 --> 01:01:32.930
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for English newspapers,</v>

1216
01:01:32.931 --> 01:01:34.730
<v Speaker 2>exactly what was going on in the Soviet </v>
<v Speaker 2>Union.</v>

1217
01:01:34.870 --> 01:01:37.640
<v Speaker 2>The bloody intellectuals didn't admit it</v>
<v Speaker 2>until the mid seventies,</v>

1218
01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:40.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the exception of people like George</v>

1219
01:01:40.490 --> 01:01:45.490
<v Speaker 2>Orwell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So why do these patterns repeat </v>

1220
01:01:45.490 --> 01:01:47.570
<v Speaker 2>themselves?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is it about human beings?</v>

1221
01:01:47.660 --> 01:01:48.980
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we like things simple.</v>

1222
01:01:49.820 --> 01:01:54.820
<v Speaker 2>We like things simple.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So say you often like a simple </v>

1223
01:01:54.820 --> 01:01:57.320
<v Speaker 2>explanation is a good explanation unless</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's too simple.</v>

1224
01:01:57.321 --> 01:02:00.830
<v Speaker 2>But distinguishing between simple and </v>
<v Speaker 2>too simple is no easy matter.</v>

1225
01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:03.950
<v Speaker 2>We like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we like to know who's our friend and our</v>

1226
01:02:03.951 --> 01:02:08.951
<v Speaker 2>enemy and we liked the feeling of </v>
<v Speaker 2>unearned moral superiority and moral </v>

1227
01:02:09.870 --> 01:02:10.420
<v Speaker 2>standard yard.</v>

1228
01:02:10.450 --> 01:02:10.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

1229
01:02:11.010 --> 01:02:14.090
<v Speaker 2>that's the challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially when there's no such thing as</v>

1230
01:02:14.091 --> 01:02:16.550
<v Speaker 2>earning anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1231
01:02:16.551 --> 01:02:21.551
<v Speaker 2>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's deeper and darker things </v>

1232
01:02:21.551 --> 01:02:21.551
<v Speaker 2>that are underneath that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like the,</v>

1233
01:02:21.551 --> 01:02:24.150
<v Speaker 2>the human proclivity to pull down those </v>
<v Speaker 2>who have more than you.</v>

1234
01:02:24.260 --> 01:02:29.260
<v Speaker 2>It's like these kids on the campuses who</v>
<v Speaker 2>are claiming identity with the </v>

1235
01:02:29.260 --> 01:02:29.260
<v Speaker 2>oppressed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1236
01:02:29.260 --> 01:02:33.420
<v Speaker 2>somewhere like Yale.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like how in the world you can speak</v>

1237
01:02:33.421 --> 01:02:36.660
<v Speaker 2>of oppression if you happen to be at </v>
<v Speaker 2>Yale is beyond me.</v>

1238
01:02:36.900 --> 01:02:37.830
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

1239
01:02:37.831 --> 01:02:40.530
<v Speaker 2>your North American,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which puts you in the top one percent,</v>

1240
01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:43.670
<v Speaker 2>and then of North Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're in the top one percent,</v>

1241
01:02:43.900 --> 01:02:48.120
<v Speaker 2>the top one percent of one percent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yet you want that,</v>

1242
01:02:48.121 --> 01:02:51.930
<v Speaker 2>you want to have all the power that goes</v>
<v Speaker 2>along with that and you want to have the</v>

1243
01:02:51.931 --> 01:02:56.931
<v Speaker 2>moral superiority that comes from being </v>
<v Speaker 2>a representative of the oppressed.</v>

1244
01:02:57.721 --> 01:03:02.721
<v Speaker 2>So that's exactly what you want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want all the power and you want all </v>

1245
01:03:02.721 --> 01:03:02.721
<v Speaker 2>the victimization at the same time.</v>

1246
01:03:02.980 --> 01:03:03.460
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yours.</v>

1247
01:03:03.500 --> 01:03:08.500
<v Speaker 4>Yale is a great example because Yale was</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of what happened with the Halloween </v>

1248
01:03:09.281 --> 01:03:14.281
<v Speaker 4>costume debacle at gale was one of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>first videos that was released that made</v>

1249
01:03:15.041 --> 01:03:20.041
<v Speaker 4>people horrified where they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they couldn't believe how students were </v>

1250
01:03:20.041 --> 01:03:20.170
<v Speaker 4>communicating with professors.</v>

1251
01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:20.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1252
01:03:20.771 --> 01:03:23.230
<v Speaker 2>the student who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who screamed up a storm about,</v>

1253
01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:24.530
<v Speaker 2>about that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1254
01:03:24.640 --> 01:03:28.840
<v Speaker 2>the male professor who was the husband </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the woman who wrote the Pro Halloween</v>

1255
01:03:28.841 --> 01:03:33.841
<v Speaker 2>costume letter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it turned out she was on the bloody </v>

1256
01:03:33.841 --> 01:03:34.300
<v Speaker 2>hiring committee that hired him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things she screamed was,</v>

1257
01:03:34.330 --> 01:03:35.800
<v Speaker 2>who hired you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>

1258
01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:40.920
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it turned out it was you because you </v>

1259
01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:40.920
<v Speaker 2>were on the committee just a few years </v>
<v Speaker 2>before.</v>

1260
01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:41.290
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they took it like,</v>

1261
01:03:41.860 --> 01:03:42.070
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1262
01:03:42.490 --> 01:03:45.530
<v Speaker 4>explain that to people that don't know </v>
<v Speaker 4>what the hell we're talking about.</v>

1263
01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:50.680
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the explain this debacle because it </v>

1264
01:03:50.680 --> 01:03:52.070
<v Speaker 4>really was about questionable Halloween </v>
<v Speaker 4>costumes.</v>

1265
01:03:52.380 --> 01:03:57.380
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was about questioning Halloween </v>

1266
01:03:57.380 --> 01:03:59.361
<v Speaker 2>costumes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Halloween costumes are a part of the </v>

1267
01:03:59.640 --> 01:04:02.370
<v Speaker 2>whole point of Halloween is to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>questionable costumes.</v>

1268
01:04:02.371 --> 01:04:04.230
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You play with depth for example,</v>

1269
01:04:04.231 --> 01:04:09.231
<v Speaker 2>in decay and and horror and and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a time when the norms with regards </v>

1270
01:04:11.251 --> 01:04:16.251
<v Speaker 2>to the expression of things that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>outside of our normal behavior are </v>

1271
01:04:16.251 --> 01:04:19.731
<v Speaker 2>suspended so that everybody can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can have a little celebration as it </v>

1272
01:04:19.731 --> 01:04:20.430
<v Speaker 2>turns out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1273
01:04:20.490 --> 01:04:22.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>campuses have got all upset about things</v>

1274
01:04:22.651 --> 01:04:26.730
<v Speaker 2>like cultural appropriation at Queen's </v>
<v Speaker 2>University in Canada just the other week</v>

1275
01:04:27.090 --> 01:04:30.540
<v Speaker 2>they were going after students who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>dressing up as Vietcong for example,</v>

1276
01:04:30.541 --> 01:04:31.530
<v Speaker 2>or Mexicans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1277
01:04:31.650 --> 01:04:35.070
<v Speaker 2>I just don't see what the hell is racist</v>
<v Speaker 2>about dressing up like a Mexican.</v>

1278
01:04:35.071 --> 01:04:38.730
<v Speaker 2>Mexicans have a traditional traditional </v>
<v Speaker 2>clothing.</v>

1279
01:04:39.360 --> 01:04:42.420
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing wrong with Mexicans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so why is it wrong?</v>

1280
01:04:42.421 --> 01:04:43.730
<v Speaker 2>Just dress up like that.</v>

1281
01:04:43.910 --> 01:04:45.830
<v Speaker 4>If you want to be Poncho via for </v>
<v Speaker 4>Halloween,</v>

1282
01:04:45.860 --> 01:04:46.610
<v Speaker 4>what's wrong with that?</v>

1283
01:04:46.820 --> 01:04:51.820
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well we'll give you can you can regard </v>

1284
01:04:51.820 --> 01:04:51.820
<v Speaker 2>that as an image just as much as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>denigration.</v>

1285
01:04:51.820 --> 01:04:53.160
<v Speaker 2>It's like why is that such a problem?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1286
01:04:53.350 --> 01:04:58.350
<v Speaker 2>But anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter because nothing's too </v>

1287
01:04:58.350 --> 01:05:00.451
<v Speaker 2>trivial to be a problem to a social </v>
<v Speaker 2>justice warrior and because they don't </v>

1288
01:05:00.451 --> 01:05:03.130
<v Speaker 2>like to deal with real problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Yale went after Halloween</v>

1289
01:05:03.170 --> 01:05:08.170
<v Speaker 4>costs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So this woman wrote a letter saying </v>

1290
01:05:08.170 --> 01:05:10.030
<v Speaker 4>maybe we should just relax about this </v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff and you know,</v>

1291
01:05:10.031 --> 01:05:15.031
<v Speaker 4>and not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't put restrictions on what people </v>

1292
01:05:15.031 --> 01:05:17.651
<v Speaker 4>wear for Halloween,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but let people decide what is and isn't </v>

1293
01:05:17.651 --> 01:05:17.651
<v Speaker 4>offensive.</v>

1294
01:05:17.651 --> 01:05:17.690
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well in</v>

1295
01:05:18.070 --> 01:05:21.370
<v Speaker 4>many Halloween costumes are offensive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the point.</v>

1296
01:05:21.580 --> 01:05:24.510
<v Speaker 4>But her letter was in a really </v>
<v Speaker 4>reasonable.</v>

1297
01:05:24.511 --> 01:05:26.050
<v Speaker 4>It was perfectly reasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like,</v>

1298
01:05:26.190 --> 01:05:28.170
<v Speaker 4>it was like an adult wrote it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1299
01:05:28.180 --> 01:05:28.750
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

1300
01:05:28.751 --> 01:05:31.780
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all hell broke loose and she ended up.</v>

1301
01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:34.340
<v Speaker 4>She ended up quitting and I think he </v>
<v Speaker 4>did.</v>

1302
01:05:34.540 --> 01:05:35.200
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think.</v>

1303
01:05:35.250 --> 01:05:37.100
<v Speaker 4>I don't think he left.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think he left,</v>

1304
01:05:37.101 --> 01:05:42.101
<v Speaker 4>but she did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Seeing him bow down to this woman </v>

1305
01:05:42.101 --> 01:05:44.990
<v Speaker 4>screaming at him in his face was so </v>
<v Speaker 4>disturbing.</v>

1306
01:05:45.050 --> 01:05:49.550
<v Speaker 4>It was so humiliating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I felt so humiliated for him because she</v>

1307
01:05:49.551 --> 01:05:51.560
<v Speaker 4>was screaming,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is our home.</v>

1308
01:05:51.561 --> 01:05:55.070
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not making it home.</v>

1309
01:05:55.130 --> 01:05:56.680
<v Speaker 4>The university's not a home,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1310
01:05:56.770 --> 01:06:00.130
<v Speaker 2>It's not a safe space.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a secure space.</v>

1311
01:06:00.370 --> 01:06:01.500
<v Speaker 2>None of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1312
01:06:01.501 --> 01:06:03.270
<v Speaker 2>and if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that,</v>

1313
01:06:03.630 --> 01:06:08.440
<v Speaker 2>when they get a university isn't a home,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not what it is.</v>

1314
01:06:08.500 --> 01:06:12.850
<v Speaker 2>It's a place to be confronted by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say often horrible ideas.</v>

1315
01:06:13.120 --> 01:06:15.610
<v Speaker 2>You want to learn about history,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think that's going to be safe.</v>

1316
01:06:15.640 --> 01:06:19.360
<v Speaker 2>Do you know what human history is like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an endless blood bath with,</v>

1317
01:06:19.630 --> 01:06:24.630
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a certain amount of hopeful </v>

1318
01:06:24.630 --> 01:06:24.630
<v Speaker 2>progress underlying it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1319
01:06:24.630 --> 01:06:24.640
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

1320
01:06:24.670 --> 01:06:27.580
<v Speaker 2>it's a horror show and great literature </v>
<v Speaker 2>is like that.</v>

1321
01:06:27.581 --> 01:06:28.470
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1322
01:06:28.590 --> 01:06:33.160
<v Speaker 2>and biology is terrifying and physics is</v>
<v Speaker 2>terrifying and you want to be safe.</v>

1323
01:06:33.161 --> 01:06:35.740
<v Speaker 2>It's stay home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stay home with your mom,</v>

1324
01:06:35.860 --> 01:06:40.860
<v Speaker 2>stay home with your dad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't come to university if you want to </v>

1325
01:06:40.860 --> 01:06:41.070
<v Speaker 2>be safe because even go outside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1326
01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:46.080
<v Speaker 2>why don't we have you if you're going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If the university is going to make you </v>

1327
01:06:46.080 --> 01:06:47.260
<v Speaker 2>safe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it ceased to be a university,</v>

1328
01:06:47.800 --> 01:06:49.750
<v Speaker 2>so one of the things I try to do in my </v>
<v Speaker 2>class,</v>

1329
01:06:49.751 --> 01:06:51.430
<v Speaker 2>I have this class called maps of </v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning,</v>

1330
01:06:51.431 --> 01:06:56.431
<v Speaker 2>which concentrates on atrocity basically</v>
<v Speaker 2>on Soviet atrocity and and Nazi </v>

1331
01:06:57.041 --> 01:07:02.041
<v Speaker 2>atrocities mostly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what I try to do in the class is to </v>

1332
01:07:02.041 --> 01:07:04.450
<v Speaker 2>teach my students that had they been in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Nazi Germany in the 19 thirties,</v>

1333
01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:09.600
<v Speaker 2>they would have been Nazis and had they </v>
<v Speaker 2>been offered the opportunity to be an </v>

1334
01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:13.681
<v Speaker 2>Auschwitz,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Auschwitz camp guard than maybe they </v>

1335
01:07:13.681 --> 01:07:14.170
<v Speaker 2>would have leapt at it and maybe they </v>
<v Speaker 2>would have been in the sadistic,</v>

1336
01:07:14.910 --> 01:07:18.880
<v Speaker 2>in the more sadistic proportion of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Auschwitz camp guard population.</v>

1337
01:07:19.180 --> 01:07:24.180
<v Speaker 2>You think that makes you feel safe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make you feel safe to know </v>

1338
01:07:24.180 --> 01:07:25.720
<v Speaker 2>that Nazis were humans and you happen to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be one of them.</v>

1339
01:07:26.620 --> 01:07:31.620
<v Speaker 2>So I think that educators that tell </v>
<v Speaker 2>students that they're offering them a </v>

1340
01:07:31.620 --> 01:07:33.400
<v Speaker 2>safe space are doing them a profound </v>
<v Speaker 2>disservice.</v>

1341
01:07:33.401 --> 01:07:38.401
<v Speaker 2>And you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a clinical psychologist and here's </v>

1342
01:07:38.401 --> 01:07:39.790
<v Speaker 2>one of the things you do to make people </v>
<v Speaker 2>less afraid.</v>

1343
01:07:40.750 --> 01:07:45.750
<v Speaker 2>You don't make the world safer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What you do is you people tell you what </v>

1344
01:07:46.751 --> 01:07:51.751
<v Speaker 2>they're afraid of and then you break it </v>
<v Speaker 2>into little bits so that they can go </v>

1345
01:07:51.751 --> 01:07:51.751
<v Speaker 2>confront them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1346
01:07:51.751 --> 01:07:54.200
<v Speaker 2>so maybe they afraid of going to a party</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you break that down.</v>

1347
01:07:54.220 --> 01:07:54.610
<v Speaker 2>You say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1348
01:07:54.611 --> 01:07:56.230
<v Speaker 2>do you know how to introduce yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>

1349
01:07:56.231 --> 01:08:01.231
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know I don't really even know how to </v>

1350
01:08:01.231 --> 01:08:02.431
<v Speaker 2>shake someone's hand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so then you practice having them </v>

1351
01:08:02.431 --> 01:08:05.161
<v Speaker 2>shake their hand and introduce </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves because maybe they weren't </v>

1352
01:08:05.161 --> 01:08:05.161
<v Speaker 2>taught by that by their halfway did </v>
<v Speaker 2>parents,</v>

1353
01:08:05.161 --> 01:08:06.610
<v Speaker 2>when they were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they were young,</v>

1354
01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:08.830
<v Speaker 2>because they were ignored and so then </v>
<v Speaker 2>you say,</v>

1355
01:08:08.831 --> 01:08:13.831
<v Speaker 2>well maybe you can go to a party for </v>
<v Speaker 2>half an hour and all you have to do is </v>

1356
01:08:13.831 --> 01:08:15.860
<v Speaker 2>introduce yourself to people and we'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>call that success and you build up their</v>

1357
01:08:15.861 --> 01:08:16.490
<v Speaker 2>competence</v>

1358
01:08:16.490 --> 01:08:21.490
<v Speaker 3>and their confidence one step at a time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what happens to the clinical </v>

1359
01:08:21.490 --> 01:08:23.930
<v Speaker 3>literature indicates quite clearly is </v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't make people less anxious.</v>

1360
01:08:23.931 --> 01:08:26.270
<v Speaker 3>By doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you make them braver.</v>

1361
01:08:27.560 --> 01:08:31.640
<v Speaker 3>It's not the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't make the world and its horrors</v>

1362
01:08:32.060 --> 01:08:37.060
<v Speaker 3>smaller.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You make the person and their their </v>

1363
01:08:37.060 --> 01:08:38.090
<v Speaker 3>their capacity to deal with horror </v>
<v Speaker 3>larger.</v>

1364
01:08:38.420 --> 01:08:40.670
<v Speaker 3>You encourage them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you strengthened them.</v>

1365
01:08:40.870 --> 01:08:44.240
<v Speaker 3>Now that's what you do at a university.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You arm people with arguments,</v>

1366
01:08:44.290 --> 01:08:45.980
<v Speaker 3>you hone their intellect,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1367
01:08:46.250 --> 01:08:48.890
<v Speaker 3>you help them learn to write so they can</v>
<v Speaker 3>marshal their arguments.</v>

1368
01:08:48.891 --> 01:08:53.891
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll help them learn how to engage in </v>

1369
01:08:53.891 --> 01:08:55.721
<v Speaker 3>intellectual combat because that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>better than engaging in real combat and </v>

1370
01:08:55.721 --> 01:08:57.920
<v Speaker 3>you make them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You make them hard and strong.</v>

1371
01:08:58.100 --> 01:09:02.900
<v Speaker 3>You don't mollycoddle them and make them</v>
<v Speaker 3>safe unless you're their enemy,</v>

1372
01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:05.210
<v Speaker 3>unless you're trying to devour their </v>
<v Speaker 3>spirit.</v>

1373
01:09:06.320 --> 01:09:08.510
<v Speaker 3>And that's what we have in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>universities we have.</v>

1374
01:09:08.870 --> 01:09:11.450
<v Speaker 3>We have the reign of the diploe mother </v>
<v Speaker 3>who's,</v>

1375
01:09:11.480 --> 01:09:12.620
<v Speaker 3>who's answered everything is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1376
01:09:12.621 --> 01:09:15.590
<v Speaker 3>just come a little closer and I'll </v>
<v Speaker 3>protect you from the world.</v>

1377
01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.160
<v Speaker 3>It's just like Hansel and Gretel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1378
01:09:18.310 --> 01:09:18.920
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1379
01:09:19.020 --> 01:09:20.060
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the witch,</v>

1380
01:09:20.061 --> 01:09:21.710
<v Speaker 3>and the Hansel and Gretel story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1381
01:09:21.711 --> 01:09:24.440
<v Speaker 3>my house is made of gingerbread.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just come in here and everything will be</v>

1382
01:09:24.441 --> 01:09:25.370
<v Speaker 3>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>While she feeds,</v>

1383
01:09:25.371 --> 01:09:27.440
<v Speaker 3>you can need to fatten you up so she can</v>
<v Speaker 3>eat you.</v>

1384
01:09:28.040 --> 01:09:30.170
<v Speaker 3>That's the archetype of a modern </v>
<v Speaker 3>university.</v>

1385
01:09:30.950 --> 01:09:33.440
<v Speaker 3>When did this start?</v>
<v Speaker 3>When did the trigger warnings,</v>

1386
01:09:33.441 --> 01:09:36.320
<v Speaker 3>when did the safe spaces,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when did all this emerge?</v>

1387
01:09:36.710 --> 01:09:41.710
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it has its roots in the student </v>

1388
01:09:41.710 --> 01:09:41.710
<v Speaker 3>radicalism of the 19 sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially the far left radical Islam.</v>

1389
01:09:42.230 --> 01:09:47.230
<v Speaker 3>It really popped up in the 19 nineties </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the early nineties when I was </v>

1390
01:09:47.230 --> 01:09:51.251
<v Speaker 3>teaching in the US at that point and </v>
<v Speaker 3>which university I taught at Harvard </v>

1391
01:09:51.251 --> 01:09:54.821
<v Speaker 3>from 93 to 98 and there was a fair push </v>
<v Speaker 3>for political correctness especially in </v>

1392
01:09:55.490 --> 01:09:57.990
<v Speaker 3>the early part of the nineties but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it,</v>

1393
01:09:58.050 --> 01:10:03.050
<v Speaker 3>it got pushed back down and disappeared </v>
<v Speaker 3>and went under ground and went </v>

1394
01:10:03.050 --> 01:10:06.461
<v Speaker 3>underground is more accurate and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just come back with a vengeance in </v>

1395
01:10:06.461 --> 01:10:09.590
<v Speaker 3>the last five years and I think it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>partly because we have all these radical</v>

1396
01:10:09.591 --> 01:10:13.400
<v Speaker 3>left political activists departments at </v>
<v Speaker 3>the universities.</v>

1397
01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:18.400
<v Speaker 3>Women's studies being at the top of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>list that have done nothing for the last</v>

1398
01:10:18.590 --> 01:10:22.040
<v Speaker 3>30 years to even longer than that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now it's almost 40 years,</v>

1399
01:10:22.370 --> 01:10:23.330
<v Speaker 3>30 years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>

1400
01:10:23.930 --> 01:10:28.010
<v Speaker 3>have done nothing but producing a never </v>
<v Speaker 3>ending stream of ideological.</v>

1401
01:10:28.011 --> 01:10:33.011
<v Speaker 3>He minded counter civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 3>political activists and that's all </v>

1402
01:10:33.171 --> 01:10:36.380
<v Speaker 3>subsidized by,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by tuition and by the public purse.</v>

1403
01:10:36.500 --> 01:10:41.500
<v Speaker 3>And that's another thing we really got </v>
<v Speaker 3>to ask ourselves is why the hell are we </v>

1404
01:10:41.500 --> 01:10:44.540
<v Speaker 3>subsidizing revolution?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why are we doing that?</v>

1405
01:10:45.590 --> 01:10:49.010
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy and it's dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's dangerous.</v>

1406
01:10:52.070 --> 01:10:55.190
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what exactly is going on with women's</v>

1407
01:10:55.191 --> 01:10:58.730
<v Speaker 3>studies that you believe is fostering </v>
<v Speaker 3>revolution?</v>

1408
01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:01.100
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd go on their websites and read,</v>

1409
01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:03.050
<v Speaker 3>read what they say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1410
01:11:03.051 --> 01:11:03.950
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the,</v>

1411
01:11:03.980 --> 01:11:06.600
<v Speaker 3>for the women's studies types,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is a,</v>

1412
01:11:07.040 --> 01:11:10.940
<v Speaker 3>what would you call it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a false anthropology.</v>

1413
01:11:10.941 --> 01:11:15.941
<v Speaker 3>There's this idea that way back when </v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a feminist paradise,</v>

1414
01:11:16.280 --> 01:11:18.870
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that would be like noble savage mode</v>

1415
01:11:18.871 --> 01:11:23.340
<v Speaker 3>of living where everything was </v>
<v Speaker 3>egalitarianism and a women dominated.</v>

1416
01:11:23.341 --> 01:11:28.260
<v Speaker 3>It was a matriarchal culture that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>put forward by Ucla anthropologist named</v>

1417
01:11:28.290 --> 01:11:30.750
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can never pronounce her name properly,</v>

1418
01:11:30.751 --> 01:11:35.751
<v Speaker 3>but I think I got it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then that was overthrown by </v>

1419
01:11:35.751 --> 01:11:38.180
<v Speaker 3>patriarchal institutions essentially </v>
<v Speaker 3>starting at about the time say,</v>

1420
01:11:38.190 --> 01:11:38.940
<v Speaker 3>of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

1421
01:11:38.941 --> 01:11:40.140
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of Judaism.</v>

1422
01:11:40.860 --> 01:11:45.860
<v Speaker 3>And that was all overthrown.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And ever since then we've lived in an </v>

1423
01:11:45.860 --> 01:11:46.710
<v Speaker 3>oppressive patriarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's what our culture is.</v>

1424
01:11:46.710 --> 01:11:51.710
<v Speaker 3>It's an oppressive patriarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they're pointing to one unsuccessful </v>

1425
01:11:51.710 --> 01:11:51.950
<v Speaker 3>society that they believe existed or did</v>
<v Speaker 3>it?</v>

1426
01:11:51.980 --> 01:11:52.890
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1427
01:11:52.891 --> 01:11:55.020
<v Speaker 3>it didn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no evidence for whatsoever.</v>

1428
01:11:55.021 --> 01:11:55.720
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1429
01:11:55.730 --> 01:11:57.300
<v Speaker 3>it's complicated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's the,</v>

1430
01:11:57.570 --> 01:12:02.570
<v Speaker 3>it's the telling of a kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychological myth as if it was history </v>

1431
01:12:02.570 --> 01:12:03.150
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1432
01:12:03.540 --> 01:12:04.620
<v Speaker 3>and anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1433
01:12:04.621 --> 01:12:08.640
<v Speaker 3>so the basic claim is that Western </v>
<v Speaker 3>civilization is a brutish patriarchy and</v>

1434
01:12:08.641 --> 01:12:13.641
<v Speaker 3>that whatever positive things that </v>
<v Speaker 3>might've managed to accomplish were all </v>

1435
01:12:13.641 --> 01:12:14.670
<v Speaker 3>accomplished as a consequence of </v>
<v Speaker 3>oppression and,</v>

1436
01:12:15.030 --> 01:12:16.620
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and theft,</v>

1437
01:12:16.860 --> 01:12:21.720
<v Speaker 3>and that the appropriate thing to do is </v>
<v Speaker 3>to restructure it from the bottom up and</v>

1438
01:12:21.721 --> 01:12:25.260
<v Speaker 3>they mean that they mean that they mean </v>
<v Speaker 3>every single bloody concept.</v>

1439
01:12:25.261 --> 01:12:30.261
<v Speaker 3>And you can marry that with modern </v>
<v Speaker 3>postmodernism and throw in a nice stash </v>

1440
01:12:30.261 --> 01:12:33.651
<v Speaker 3>of Marxism and you have the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ideological and motivated grounds </v>

1441
01:12:34.291 --> 01:12:39.291
<v Speaker 3>for social revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm just go online and look at a </v>

1442
01:12:40.051 --> 01:12:41.970
<v Speaker 3>dozen women studies websites.</v>

1443
01:12:42.060 --> 01:12:45.030
<v Speaker 3>Just read them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can see what they say.</v>

1444
01:12:45.031 --> 01:12:46.990
<v Speaker 3>They produce political activists and </v>
<v Speaker 3>error.</v>

1445
01:12:47.260 --> 01:12:50.040
<v Speaker 3>A goal is to restructure the patriarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1446
01:12:50.041 --> 01:12:55.041
<v Speaker 3>what's the patriarchy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>While the patriarchy is Western </v>

1447
01:12:55.041 --> 01:12:55.041
<v Speaker 3>civilization and what is restructure </v>
<v Speaker 3>mean?</v>

1448
01:12:55.200 --> 01:12:58.500
<v Speaker 3>That's easy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It means tear it down and destroy it.</v>

1449
01:12:58.620 --> 01:13:03.620
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because it's a brutish system that's </v>

1450
01:13:03.620 --> 01:13:05.720
<v Speaker 3>predicated on nothing but oppression.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's nothing but a tyranny in the.</v>

1451
01:13:05.730 --> 01:13:08.940
<v Speaker 3>In the eyes of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the radical women's studies types.</v>

1452
01:13:09.480 --> 01:13:11.340
<v Speaker 3>Heterosexuality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a tyranny.</v>

1453
01:13:11.370 --> 01:13:12.840
<v Speaker 3>Capitalism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a tyranny.</v>

1454
01:13:12.870 --> 01:13:13.780
<v Speaker 3>Democracy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1455
01:13:13.781 --> 01:13:15.420
<v Speaker 3>that doesn't even exist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and even if it did,</v>

1456
01:13:15.421 --> 01:13:18.420
<v Speaker 3>it would be a tyranny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything's a tyranny,</v>

1457
01:13:19.450 --> 01:13:22.920
<v Speaker 3>and so you can ask these and what would </v>
<v Speaker 3>they replace it with?</v>

1458
01:13:22.950 --> 01:13:25.590
<v Speaker 3>They replace it with their own </v>
<v Speaker 3>ideological utopia.</v>

1459
01:13:25.591 --> 01:13:28.200
<v Speaker 3>While we've already had 100 years of </v>
<v Speaker 3>that and we saw what happened.</v>

1460
01:13:28.290 --> 01:13:29.310
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that doesn't matter.</v>

1461
01:13:29.311 --> 01:13:31.830
<v Speaker 3>That wasn't real Marxism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what the bloody marks is.</v>

1462
01:13:31.850 --> 01:13:34.410
<v Speaker 3>Always say that wasn't real Marxism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1463
01:13:34.440 --> 01:13:39.440
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how many millions of people have to die </v>

1464
01:13:39.440 --> 01:13:42.051
<v Speaker 3>before you're convinced that it's real </v>
<v Speaker 3>Marxism and I know what they mean by </v>

1465
01:13:42.051 --> 01:13:42.051
<v Speaker 3>that too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They mean,</v>

1466
01:13:42.051 --> 01:13:44.430
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I was the Marxists dictator,</v>

1467
01:13:44.670 --> 01:13:47.670
<v Speaker 3>things would've gone a lot better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a.</v>

1468
01:13:48.440 --> 01:13:50.460
<v Speaker 3>You should think again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sunshine.</v>

1469
01:13:51.030 --> 01:13:56.030
<v Speaker 3>If you were the Marxists dictator,</v>
<v Speaker 3>things wouldn't have gotten a lot </v>

1470
01:13:56.030 --> 01:13:58.760
<v Speaker 3>better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you're the sort of person that </v>

1471
01:13:58.760 --> 01:13:58.760
<v Speaker 3>thinks that if you would have been </v>
<v Speaker 3>controlled,</v>

1472
01:13:58.760 --> 01:14:03.111
<v Speaker 3>things would have gone a lot better than</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're exactly the sort of person who </v>

1473
01:14:03.111 --> 01:14:04.740
<v Speaker 3>should never be in control.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1474
01:14:04.910 --> 01:14:07.200
<v Speaker 3>and it's resentment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's horrible.</v>

1475
01:14:07.201 --> 01:14:08.340
<v Speaker 3>Resentment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1476
01:14:08.450 --> 01:14:11.230
<v Speaker 3>That's an important point because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think this is something that you've said</v>

1477
01:14:11.231 --> 01:14:12.130
<v Speaker 3>that I absolutely agree</v>

1478
01:14:12.130 --> 01:14:15.850
<v Speaker 1>with that I think a lot of this thinking</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the way people are behaving,</v>

1479
01:14:16.180 --> 01:14:21.180
<v Speaker 1>it seems based on revenge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems based on revenge for awkward </v>

1480
01:14:21.180 --> 01:14:25.530
<v Speaker 1>upbringings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>social uncomfortable of </v>

1481
01:14:25.530 --> 01:14:28.680
<v Speaker 1>uncomfortability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it seems like there's something </v>

1482
01:14:28.680 --> 01:14:31.410
<v Speaker 1>about the way they view the world where </v>
<v Speaker 1>they want to get back at people that </v>

1483
01:14:31.410 --> 01:14:32.200
<v Speaker 1>have literally done them no wrong.</v>

1484
01:14:32.240 --> 01:14:36.170
<v Speaker 2>It's resentment for the burden of being.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's deeper.</v>

1485
01:14:36.230 --> 01:14:41.230
<v Speaker 2>It's deeper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean human being human existence is </v>

1486
01:14:41.230 --> 01:14:41.230
<v Speaker 2>characterized by a fair bit of </v>
<v Speaker 2>suffering.</v>

1487
01:14:41.230 --> 01:14:43.190
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're limited creatures and life is very</v>

1488
01:14:43.191 --> 01:14:44.630
<v Speaker 2>hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone dies.</v>

1489
01:14:44.631 --> 01:14:47.210
<v Speaker 2>Everyone you love is going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of the things you do,</v>

1490
01:14:47.300 --> 01:14:49.520
<v Speaker 2>all of the things you do will eventually</v>
<v Speaker 2>fail.</v>

1491
01:14:50.130 --> 01:14:55.130
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>suffering is a certainty and it's very </v>

1492
01:14:55.130 --> 01:14:55.130
<v Speaker 2>easy for people to become resentful </v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

1493
01:14:55.130 --> 01:14:56.990
<v Speaker 2>about being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about existence.</v>

1494
01:14:57.320 --> 01:14:59.450
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these kids who shoot up high schools and</v>

1495
01:14:59.480 --> 01:15:01.970
<v Speaker 2>and and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these mass shooters there,</v>

1496
01:15:01.980 --> 01:15:06.980
<v Speaker 2>they're the perfect examples of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of people who run on nothing but </v>

1497
01:15:06.980 --> 01:15:08.060
<v Speaker 2>resentment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're out to kill the innocent because</v>

1498
01:15:08.061 --> 01:15:13.061
<v Speaker 2>that's the best marker of a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the best way of showing just how </v>

1499
01:15:13.061 --> 01:15:14.660
<v Speaker 2>much contempt they have for existence </v>
<v Speaker 2>itself.</v>

1500
01:15:14.900 --> 01:15:17.060
<v Speaker 2>Why punish the guilty?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They deserve to be punished.</v>

1501
01:15:17.061 --> 01:15:19.770
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot more malevolent and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1502
01:15:19.780 --> 01:15:20.510
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1503
01:15:20.600 --> 01:15:25.600
<v Speaker 2>and vengeful to punish the innocent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like people are motivated to a </v>

1504
01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:29.600
<v Speaker 2>great degree by resentment of being and </v>
<v Speaker 2>a huge chunk of that is manifested in,</v>

1505
01:15:30.080 --> 01:15:32.330
<v Speaker 2>out to the dark side of the ideological </v>
<v Speaker 2>possession.</v>

1506
01:15:33.110 --> 01:15:38.110
<v Speaker 2>So I get to decide who my enemies are </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I get to go after them and I </v>

1507
01:15:38.110 --> 01:15:41.291
<v Speaker 2>can go after them for every single thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's ever been done to me that isn't </v>

1508
01:15:41.291 --> 01:15:42.890
<v Speaker 2>good and we'll a lot of that's just </v>
<v Speaker 2>built into the structure of existence.</v>

1509
01:15:43.010 --> 01:15:46.550
<v Speaker 1>Then they group up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they the exhibit confirmation bias.</v>

1510
01:15:46.580 --> 01:15:51.580
<v Speaker 1>They all form some sort of a group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think and then they act accordingly and </v>

1511
01:15:52.880 --> 01:15:57.880
<v Speaker 1>this is what you've been warning against</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is where I completely agree </v>

1512
01:15:57.880 --> 01:16:01.871
<v Speaker 1>with you in this why I think the subject</v>
<v Speaker 1>is so important and I love the way </v>

1513
01:16:01.871 --> 01:16:04.451
<v Speaker 1>you've outlined all the steps and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems with Marxism and ideologies in </v>

1514
01:16:04.451 --> 01:16:08.771
<v Speaker 1>general that we are dealing with this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are the beginning steps of it and </v>

1515
01:16:08.771 --> 01:16:11.330
<v Speaker 1>people who look at it now and they say </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's social change and social justice.</v>

1516
01:16:11.780 --> 01:16:12.410
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>

1517
01:16:12.650 --> 01:16:13.760
<v Speaker 2>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not.</v>

1518
01:16:13.790 --> 01:16:14.690
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not.</v>

1519
01:16:15.080 --> 01:16:20.080
<v Speaker 2>This is not going to improve things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Implementing these policies will make </v>

1520
01:16:20.080 --> 01:16:20.080
<v Speaker 2>things worse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've made things worse.</v>

1521
01:16:20.080 --> 01:16:24.911
<v Speaker 2>Every single place they've ever been </v>
<v Speaker 2>implemented and often they've made </v>

1522
01:16:24.911 --> 01:16:28.511
<v Speaker 2>things so much worse that you actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>can't imagine it and people don't do the</v>

1523
01:16:28.911 --> 01:16:30.140
<v Speaker 2>reading.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've done the reading,</v>

1524
01:16:30.980 --> 01:16:33.320
<v Speaker 2>I've done the reading.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know how bad things can get.</v>

1525
01:16:33.800 --> 01:16:36.290
<v Speaker 2>They can get so bad that no matter how </v>
<v Speaker 2>bad you think they are,</v>

1526
01:16:36.291 --> 01:16:37.910
<v Speaker 2>you're not even in the bloody ballpark.</v>

1527
01:16:38.930 --> 01:16:43.930
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just so strange that these sort of </v>

1528
01:16:43.930 --> 01:16:46.660
<v Speaker 1>courses and these sort of Ida ideologies</v>
<v Speaker 1>are thriving in universities and it's </v>

1529
01:16:48.500 --> 01:16:50.750
<v Speaker 1>really disconcerting to someone who has </v>
<v Speaker 1>children.</v>

1530
01:16:51.110 --> 01:16:52.880
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that your children are going to go there</v>

1531
01:16:52.881 --> 01:16:56.060
<v Speaker 1>and they trade schools.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1532
01:16:56.061 --> 01:16:57.440
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>

1533
01:16:57.441 --> 01:16:59.510
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy used to teach at Harvard,</v>

1534
01:16:59.511 --> 01:17:01.880
<v Speaker 1>just send them to trade schools.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The universities.</v>

1535
01:17:01.881 --> 01:17:02.530
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think</v>

1536
01:17:02.530 --> 01:17:07.530
<v Speaker 2>the universities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you can make a reasonable case </v>

1537
01:17:07.530 --> 01:17:07.530
<v Speaker 2>that the universities do more harm than </v>
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>

1538
01:17:07.530 --> 01:17:09.680
<v Speaker 2>Now I hate to say that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1539
01:17:09.681 --> 01:17:10.190
<v Speaker 2>this also,</v>

1540
01:17:10.190 --> 01:17:13.550
<v Speaker 3>this is a strange time where access to </v>
<v Speaker 3>information is so incredibly easy.</v>

1541
01:17:13.580 --> 01:17:15.560
<v Speaker 3>You can get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could educate yourself,</v>

1542
01:17:15.620 --> 01:17:18.140
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Seemingly endlessly online.</v>

1543
01:17:18.460 --> 01:17:20.600
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and with books and just,</v>

1544
01:17:20.660 --> 01:17:24.830
<v Speaker 3>there's so much information available.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It says not the 19 thirties does,</v>

1545
01:17:24.920 --> 01:17:29.920
<v Speaker 3>it's not a time where it was difficult </v>
<v Speaker 3>to get an education outside of the </v>

1546
01:17:29.920 --> 01:17:32.150
<v Speaker 3>university the universities may have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or the university,</v>

1547
01:17:32.510 --> 01:17:37.510
<v Speaker 3>which is like the repository of human </v>
<v Speaker 3>wisdom and the attempt to expand that </v>

1548
01:17:39.110 --> 01:17:42.280
<v Speaker 3>may have already moved outside the </v>
<v Speaker 3>universities.</v>

1549
01:17:43.510 --> 01:17:46.010
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just because an institution calls itself</v>

1550
01:17:46.011 --> 01:17:51.011
<v Speaker 3>the university doesn't mean it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And many disciplines have turned into </v>

1551
01:17:51.011 --> 01:17:54.010
<v Speaker 3>ideological factories and so where's the</v>
<v Speaker 3>university mean?</v>

1552
01:17:54.020 --> 01:17:59.020
<v Speaker 3>The university is wherever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where anyone wants to learn about their </v>

1553
01:17:59.020 --> 01:18:02.090
<v Speaker 3>culture and where anyone wants to expand</v>
<v Speaker 3>the domain of human competence.</v>

1554
01:18:02.300 --> 01:18:04.220
<v Speaker 3>And a lot of that's happening online </v>
<v Speaker 3>now,</v>

1555
01:18:05.060 --> 01:18:06.410
<v Speaker 3>so maybe that's the future.</v>

1556
01:18:06.950 --> 01:18:08.630
<v Speaker 3>The only thing the universities have </v>
<v Speaker 3>now,</v>

1557
01:18:08.631 --> 01:18:12.050
<v Speaker 3>I think that that people can't get </v>
<v Speaker 3>elsewhere is accreditation,</v>

1558
01:18:12.410 --> 01:18:17.410
<v Speaker 3>but they're doing everything they can as</v>
<v Speaker 3>fast as possible to make their </v>

1559
01:18:17.410 --> 01:18:19.280
<v Speaker 3>accreditation valueless anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>

1560
01:18:19.281 --> 01:18:19.970
<v Speaker 3>it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's.</v>

1561
01:18:20.060 --> 01:18:25.060
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a terrible thing to say that the </v>

1562
01:18:25.060 --> 01:18:27.611
<v Speaker 3>universities may do more harm than good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I haven't come to that conclusion </v>

1563
01:18:27.611 --> 01:18:27.611
<v Speaker 3>lightly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1564
01:18:27.611 --> 01:18:29.300
<v Speaker 3>there's also say it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure you do.</v>

1565
01:18:29.960 --> 01:18:33.800
<v Speaker 3>There's also a gigantic financial stake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The amount of money that it will not.</v>

1566
01:18:34.010 --> 01:18:35.950
<v Speaker 3>And that's especially the case in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>US.</v>

1567
01:18:36.020 --> 01:18:41.020
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that's happened over </v>

1568
01:18:41.020 --> 01:18:42.641
<v Speaker 3>the last 30 years is that the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the proportion of university </v>

1569
01:18:42.641 --> 01:18:44.060
<v Speaker 3>expenditures that's gone to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>administration has,</v>

1570
01:18:44.090 --> 01:18:46.370
<v Speaker 3>has massively,</v>
<v Speaker 3>massively increased.</v>

1571
01:18:46.880 --> 01:18:50.210
<v Speaker 3>And at the same time the student loan </v>
<v Speaker 3>burden has increased.</v>

1572
01:18:50.540 --> 01:18:55.540
<v Speaker 3>And so what's happened and the weird </v>
<v Speaker 3>senses that the administrators have </v>

1573
01:18:55.540 --> 01:18:58.661
<v Speaker 3>conspired to steal the future earnings </v>
<v Speaker 3>of their students and then you can't </v>

1574
01:18:59.181 --> 01:19:00.230
<v Speaker 3>declare bankruptcy.</v>

1575
01:19:00.350 --> 01:19:05.350
<v Speaker 3>So to me it's indentured servitude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can't declare bankruptcy on </v>

1576
01:19:05.350 --> 01:19:07.610
<v Speaker 3>student loan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You cannot declare bankruptcy on student</v>

1577
01:19:07.611 --> 01:19:09.350
<v Speaker 3>loans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you think about that.</v>

1578
01:19:09.500 --> 01:19:12.590
<v Speaker 3>You tell me what difference there is </v>
<v Speaker 3>between that and indentured servitude.</v>

1579
01:19:12.800 --> 01:19:17.800
<v Speaker 3>There's not much because it's the only </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing that I can even think of where </v>

1580
01:19:17.800 --> 01:19:19.480
<v Speaker 3>that corporations can go bankrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They do it all the time.</v>

1581
01:19:19.490 --> 01:19:22.230
<v Speaker 3>Ken individuals can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Businesses can fail you.</v>

1582
01:19:22.270 --> 01:19:27.270
<v Speaker 3>You can be deemed incompetent or not </v>
<v Speaker 3>capable of paying your debt in every </v>

1583
01:19:28.041 --> 01:19:30.290
<v Speaker 3>other case,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but not with universities.</v>

1584
01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:32.180
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

1585
01:19:32.210 --> 01:19:34.490
<v Speaker 3>It is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy because they were just trying</v>

1586
01:19:34.491 --> 01:19:38.090
<v Speaker 3>to combat the issue where so many kids </v>
<v Speaker 3>were defaulting on their student loans.</v>

1587
01:19:38.240 --> 01:19:41.510
<v Speaker 3>They try to make you perpetually </v>
<v Speaker 3>responsible for it or you know.</v>

1588
01:19:41.511 --> 01:19:44.000
<v Speaker 3>The idea is that these kids have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>learn responsibility.</v>

1589
01:19:44.510 --> 01:19:48.160
<v Speaker 3>Is that the way to do it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>By overcharging them for some users will</v>

1590
01:19:48.480 --> 01:19:53.480
<v Speaker 3>say that it's not a particularly useful </v>
<v Speaker 3>to burden your citizenry with with a </v>

1591
01:19:55.011 --> 01:20:00.011
<v Speaker 3>massive debt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As soon as they graduate at a time when </v>

1592
01:20:00.011 --> 01:20:01.040
<v Speaker 3>they're most likely to take </v>
<v Speaker 3>entrepreneurial risks,</v>

1593
01:20:01.100 --> 01:20:06.100
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know you're not going to take </v>

1594
01:20:06.100 --> 01:20:06.100
<v Speaker 3>entrepreneurial risks if you're so </v>
<v Speaker 3>burdened with debt,</v>

1595
01:20:06.100 --> 01:20:06.710
<v Speaker 3>you can't get yourself off the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1596
01:20:06.711 --> 01:20:08.580
<v Speaker 3>and we're talking about hundreds of </v>
<v Speaker 3>thousands</v>

1597
01:20:08.580 --> 01:20:11.280
<v Speaker 4>of dollars in debt with people that are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you're lucky,</v>

1598
01:20:11.700 --> 01:20:12.840
<v Speaker 4>you're going to make what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Forty,</v>

1599
01:20:12.870 --> 01:20:14.790
<v Speaker 4>$50,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>a year straight out of college.</v>

1600
01:20:14.791 --> 01:20:19.791
<v Speaker 4>If you're lucky,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you're dealing with the amount of </v>

1601
01:20:19.791 --> 01:20:23.151
<v Speaker 4>money that you would have to make if you</v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't pay any taxes or didn't have any </v>

1602
01:20:23.151 --> 01:20:26.091
<v Speaker 4>expenses.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'd have to work for four or five </v>

1603
01:20:26.091 --> 01:20:28.161
<v Speaker 4>years longer than you would actually be </v>
<v Speaker 4>in college to get that degree in the </v>

1604
01:20:28.161 --> 01:20:28.770
<v Speaker 4>first place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's insane.</v>

1605
01:20:28.910 --> 01:20:29.700
<v Speaker 4>It's insane.</v>

1606
01:20:30.320 --> 01:20:31.130
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would you say to,</v>

1607
01:20:31.131 --> 01:20:32.780
<v Speaker 2>to the university students are </v>
<v Speaker 2>listening,</v>

1608
01:20:32.781 --> 01:20:34.610
<v Speaker 2>like a lot of your professors are </v>
<v Speaker 2>Marxists.</v>

1609
01:20:34.730 --> 01:20:36.860
<v Speaker 2>Ask them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ask them if they're Marxists.</v>

1610
01:20:36.950 --> 01:20:41.950
<v Speaker 2>Read the Gulag archipelago first because</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need to get your arguments together </v>

1611
01:20:41.950 --> 01:20:46.091
<v Speaker 2>and nobody and won a Nobel prize for </v>
<v Speaker 2>that book and for his other writing and </v>

1612
01:20:46.091 --> 01:20:47.780
<v Speaker 2>it was one of the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the key.</v>

1613
01:20:49.420 --> 01:20:51.800
<v Speaker 2>There was a couple of things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>brought down the Soviet Union,</v>

1614
01:20:52.310 --> 01:20:57.310
<v Speaker 2>but one of them was Alexander </v>
<v Speaker 2>Solzhenitsyn's book and he demolished </v>

1615
01:20:57.310 --> 01:20:58.700
<v Speaker 2>the intellectual credibility of of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Marxism forever,</v>

1616
01:20:58.850 --> 01:21:03.850
<v Speaker 2>but you have to read the damn book and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to get your arguments in order </v>

1617
01:21:03.850 --> 01:21:05.510
<v Speaker 2>to go after your Marxist professors ask </v>
<v Speaker 2>them difficult book to read,</v>

1618
01:21:05.530 --> 01:21:08.030
<v Speaker 2>a very difficult book to read.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a very difficult book,</v>

1619
01:21:08.031 --> 01:21:10.730
<v Speaker 2>although it's difficult because it's so </v>
<v Speaker 2>horrifying.</v>

1620
01:21:10.940 --> 01:21:13.820
<v Speaker 2>It's not difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly because it's impenetrable.</v>

1621
01:21:13.821 --> 01:21:16.340
<v Speaker 2>It's in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an absolutely fascinating book in,</v>

1622
01:21:16.350 --> 01:21:21.350
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the same way that at that it's </v>

1623
01:21:21.350 --> 01:21:21.350
<v Speaker 2>terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Horror story is fascinating,</v>

1624
01:21:21.350 --> 01:21:24.380
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's no excuse for this.</v>

1625
01:21:24.381 --> 01:21:26.840
<v Speaker 2>There's no excuse for these.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These professors who,</v>

1626
01:21:26.930 --> 01:21:29.890
<v Speaker 2>who claim who claimed to be benevolent </v>
<v Speaker 2>Marxist.</v>

1627
01:21:30.130 --> 01:21:32.520
<v Speaker 4>So I think the way you framed it is very</v>
<v Speaker 4>important.</v>

1628
01:21:32.521 --> 01:21:37.521
<v Speaker 4>I think the way you framed it as them </v>
<v Speaker 4>being compassionate intellectuals that </v>

1629
01:21:37.521 --> 01:21:41.560
<v Speaker 4>are inclined toward this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because on the surface it seems like </v>

1630
01:21:41.560 --> 01:21:44.040
<v Speaker 4>it's what a compassionate intellectual </v>
<v Speaker 4>would would support.</v>

1631
01:21:44.570 --> 01:21:45.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1632
01:21:45.490 --> 01:21:48.900
<v Speaker 2>And it's the unthinking adherence to </v>
<v Speaker 2>compassion as the highest moral virtue.</v>

1633
01:21:49.410 --> 01:21:52.200
<v Speaker 4>And it's also whenever you have an </v>
<v Speaker 4>ideology,</v>

1634
01:21:52.230 --> 01:21:57.230
<v Speaker 4>whenever you have these rigid </v>
<v Speaker 4>established forms of communication or </v>

1635
01:21:57.230 --> 01:21:58.890
<v Speaker 4>methods of thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ew,</v>

1636
01:21:58.960 --> 01:21:59.820
<v Speaker 4>ew,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ew,</v>

1637
01:21:59.850 --> 01:22:01.560
<v Speaker 4>box people in your box,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>

1638
01:22:01.561 --> 01:22:05.130
<v Speaker 4>then you control them and you get them </v>
<v Speaker 4>to stick inside that ideology.</v>

1639
01:22:05.131 --> 01:22:06.930
<v Speaker 4>And in doing so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you suppress people.</v>

1640
01:22:06.931 --> 01:22:11.931
<v Speaker 4>It's so ironic that the people that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>against suppressing are actually </v>

1641
01:22:11.931 --> 01:22:16.011
<v Speaker 4>suppressing people through enforcing </v>
<v Speaker 4>these ideologies and suppressing the </v>

1642
01:22:16.011 --> 01:22:19.950
<v Speaker 4>marketplace of free ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not allowed to have free ideas.</v>

1643
01:22:19.951 --> 01:22:21.450
<v Speaker 4>You're not allowed to debate these </v>
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>

1644
01:22:21.630 --> 01:22:22.260
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've seen.</v>

1645
01:22:22.530 --> 01:22:27.530
<v Speaker 4>There was that really famous instance at</v>
<v Speaker 4>the University of Toronto where there's </v>

1646
01:22:27.530 --> 01:22:29.540
<v Speaker 4>one guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't even remember what it barrel.</v>

1647
01:22:29.580 --> 01:22:31.380
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What was his more?</v>

1648
01:22:31.620 --> 01:22:32.450
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why men make.</v>

1649
01:22:32.660 --> 01:22:34.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a multivariate analysis of the,</v>

1650
01:22:34.751 --> 01:22:38.170
<v Speaker 2>of the income disparity between men and </v>
<v Speaker 2>women.</v>

1651
01:22:38.290 --> 01:22:43.290
<v Speaker 2>He used to be a feminist activist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He decided to go look into the claim </v>

1652
01:22:43.721 --> 01:22:46.960
<v Speaker 2>that women were making.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think at the time it was seventy cents</v>

1653
01:22:46.961 --> 01:22:48.880
<v Speaker 2>for every dollar that men were making.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He thought,</v>

1654
01:22:49.030 --> 01:22:49.810
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have daughters.</v>

1655
01:22:49.811 --> 01:22:51.970
<v Speaker 2>I better go check this out and see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1656
01:22:52.270 --> 01:22:54.220
<v Speaker 2>do a little bit of indepth </v>
<v Speaker 2>investigating.</v>

1657
01:22:54.221 --> 01:22:59.221
<v Speaker 2>And what he found out was that there </v>
<v Speaker 2>were many reasons for the disparity and </v>

1658
01:22:59.590 --> 01:23:02.230
<v Speaker 2>perhaps one of them was unfair </v>
<v Speaker 2>discrimination,</v>

1659
01:23:02.231 --> 01:23:06.250
<v Speaker 2>but there were another dozen and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>seem to account more of the disparity</v>

1660
01:23:06.250 --> 01:23:08.050
<v Speaker 1>than the discrimination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1661
01:23:08.110 --> 01:23:12.030
<v Speaker 1>just the fact that men take the more </v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous jobs is a,</v>

1662
01:23:12.031 --> 01:23:14.290
<v Speaker 1>is a huge contributor to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's not trivial.</v>

1663
01:23:14.291 --> 01:23:16.960
<v Speaker 1>You should get paid more if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>putting your limbs on the line,</v>

1664
01:23:17.680 --> 01:23:18.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1665
01:23:18.490 --> 01:23:20.590
<v Speaker 1>are you grew up in northern Alberta </v>
<v Speaker 1>where were,</v>

1666
01:23:20.650 --> 01:23:25.650
<v Speaker 1>were a lot of young men dropped out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>school and went and worked on the oil </v>

1667
01:23:25.650 --> 01:23:25.650
<v Speaker 1>rigs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you go try that.</v>

1668
01:23:25.650 --> 01:23:27.040
<v Speaker 1>Well maybe you could do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1669
01:23:27.041 --> 01:23:29.200
<v Speaker 1>the guys would lose their fingers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'd lose their toes.</v>

1670
01:23:29.201 --> 01:23:34.201
<v Speaker 1>They was 40 bloody below up there and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd be wrestling pipe in the middle </v>

1671
01:23:34.201 --> 01:23:35.020
<v Speaker 1>of the bush.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a friend who does it.</v>

1672
01:23:35.400 --> 01:23:37.180
<v Speaker 1>I have a friend who does that in </v>
<v Speaker 1>northern Alberta.</v>

1673
01:23:37.480 --> 01:23:39.130
<v Speaker 1>Horrific it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's tough work,</v>

1674
01:23:39.131 --> 01:23:40.930
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're out in the Bush for two weeks</v>

1675
01:23:41.050 --> 01:23:43.480
<v Speaker 1>and when you go outside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's temperatures where you literally</v>

1676
01:23:43.481 --> 01:23:45.520
<v Speaker 1>can't be outside of your truck for more </v>
<v Speaker 1>than 30 minutes.</v>

1677
01:23:45.550 --> 01:23:47.350
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to jump back in the truck.</v>

1678
01:23:47.351 --> 01:23:49.360
<v Speaker 1>And that was called life where I grew </v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

1679
01:23:49.880 --> 01:23:51.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

1680
01:23:51.130 --> 01:23:51.980
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1681
01:23:51.981 --> 01:23:56.981
<v Speaker 1>Those are very difficult jobs and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're very high pain because people </v>

1682
01:23:56.981 --> 01:23:57.040
<v Speaker 1>die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hard work.</v>

1683
01:23:57.041 --> 01:23:58.900
<v Speaker 1>And there's not a lot of women taking </v>
<v Speaker 1>those jobs.</v>

1684
01:23:58.950 --> 01:23:59.390
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1685
01:23:59.391 --> 01:24:00.700
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a good thing too.</v>

1686
01:24:00.730 --> 01:24:01.960
<v Speaker 1>So this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1687
01:24:02.590 --> 01:24:03.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is his name again?</v>

1688
01:24:04.240 --> 01:24:05.590
<v Speaker 1>Warren Farrell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Warren Farrell,</v>

1689
01:24:05.591 --> 01:24:10.090
<v Speaker 1>who wrote this book was giving a speech </v>
<v Speaker 1>about this book and it was,</v>

1690
01:24:10.160 --> 01:24:15.160
<v Speaker 1>the response was so unbelievably violent</v>
<v Speaker 1>and crazy and aggressive and also </v>

1691
01:24:17.351 --> 01:24:19.270
<v Speaker 1>ignorant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ignorant to what he was saying,</v>

1692
01:24:19.330 --> 01:24:24.330
<v Speaker 1>ignorant and not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not wanting to debate the facts but </v>

1693
01:24:24.330 --> 01:24:24.330
<v Speaker 1>wanting to call him a massage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>misogynist,</v>

1694
01:24:24.330 --> 01:24:28.720
<v Speaker 1>wanting to call this a hate speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a favorite man.</v>

1695
01:24:29.250 --> 01:24:34.250
<v Speaker 1>Already accused of that twice in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>last two months because I don't want to </v>

1696
01:24:34.250 --> 01:24:38.401
<v Speaker 1>use these compelled pronouns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like the one woman in the debate </v>

1697
01:24:38.401 --> 01:24:40.540
<v Speaker 1>that you had with the other man that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe is transsexual.</v>

1698
01:24:40.540 --> 01:24:43.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The one woman who was trying to say what</v>

1699
01:24:43.601 --> 01:24:48.601
<v Speaker 1>is the difference between not using </v>
<v Speaker 1>those words and using racial slurs and </v>

1700
01:24:49.871 --> 01:24:53.890
<v Speaker 1>hate speech to to describe these people </v>
<v Speaker 1>like the idea,</v>

1701
01:24:53.891 --> 01:24:58.891
<v Speaker 1>just the idea that that's a woman who is</v>
<v Speaker 1>a professor who's expressing it in that </v>

1702
01:24:58.891 --> 01:25:03.541
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the difference between not </v>

1703
01:25:03.541 --> 01:25:05.401
<v Speaker 1>choosing to use made up pronouns versus </v>
<v Speaker 1>calling someone a generally accepted </v>

1704
01:25:07.120 --> 01:25:10.420
<v Speaker 1>racial slurs that they're trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>frame that as the same thing.</v>

1705
01:25:10.600 --> 01:25:14.350
<v Speaker 1>The racial intellectually dishonest to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the racial slurs are also legal.</v>

1706
01:25:15.280 --> 01:25:20.280
<v Speaker 1>So what's happening is the law is </v>
<v Speaker 1>already there is already such that not </v>

1707
01:25:20.351 --> 01:25:24.010
<v Speaker 1>using one of these made up pronouns is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>crime.</v>

1708
01:25:24.011 --> 01:25:26.320
<v Speaker 1>Whereas using a racial epithet isn't.</v>

1709
01:25:26.680 --> 01:25:27.090
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

1710
01:25:29.010 --> 01:25:30.870
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

1711
01:25:31.500 --> 01:25:33.240
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you could use the n word.</v>

1712
01:25:33.930 --> 01:25:34.950
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's legally to.</v>

1713
01:25:35.070 --> 01:25:37.290
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can't use you,</v>

1714
01:25:37.291 --> 01:25:39.480
<v Speaker 1>can't you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can have zero.</v>

1715
01:25:40.150 --> 01:25:44.070
<v Speaker 1>He's have to say aZ who.</v>

1716
01:25:46.070 --> 01:25:46.460
<v Speaker 5>Wow,</v>

1717
01:25:47.540 --> 01:25:49.610
<v Speaker 1>this is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is really crazy.</v>

1718
01:25:50.150 --> 01:25:55.150
<v Speaker 1>This is a bizarre moment in time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas Bizarre postural nature of it is</v>

1719
01:25:56.061 --> 01:26:00.570
<v Speaker 1>so undeniable that it's forcing a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people and I,</v>

1720
01:26:01.580 --> 01:26:04.040
<v Speaker 1>I applaud you for doing what you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing</v>

1721
01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:05.210
<v Speaker 4>and risking your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your,</v>

1722
01:26:05.410 --> 01:26:10.410
<v Speaker 4>your status with the university,</v>
<v Speaker 4>risking your support of your peers and </v>

1723
01:26:10.410 --> 01:26:14.440
<v Speaker 4>sticking your neck out the way you've </v>
<v Speaker 4>been doing with your youtube videos </v>

1724
01:26:14.440 --> 01:26:17.740
<v Speaker 4>because if you hadn't done that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of people who wouldn't be </v>

1725
01:26:17.740 --> 01:26:19.880
<v Speaker 4>aware of how insidious and what you were</v>
<v Speaker 4>describing earlier.</v>

1726
01:26:19.881 --> 01:26:23.300
<v Speaker 4>The creep is slow creep towards pushing </v>
<v Speaker 4>forward,</v>

1727
01:26:23.420 --> 01:26:28.420
<v Speaker 4>waiting for you to object waiting and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then moving forward a little bit more </v>

1728
01:26:28.420 --> 01:26:28.420
<v Speaker 4>and once you relax.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>

1729
01:26:28.420 --> 01:26:29.210
<v Speaker 4>Because that's what this is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1730
01:26:30.290 --> 01:26:30.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>

1731
01:26:30.761 --> 01:26:31.730
<v Speaker 2>it's been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's been,</v>

1732
01:26:31.760 --> 01:26:33.470
<v Speaker 2>it's been bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can tell you that.</v>

1733
01:26:33.850 --> 01:26:37.550
<v Speaker 2>I mean my son and I counted the number </v>
<v Speaker 2>of press articles that have been devoted</v>

1734
01:26:37.551 --> 01:26:39.260
<v Speaker 2>to this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are serious press articles.</v>

1735
01:26:39.261 --> 01:26:42.190
<v Speaker 2>This doesn't count youtube or radio or </v>
<v Speaker 2>TV or any of those things.</v>

1736
01:26:42.220 --> 01:26:45.080
<v Speaker 2>I mean the youtube coverage has been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say overwhelming.</v>

1737
01:26:45.380 --> 01:26:50.380
<v Speaker 2>There's been 170 major press articles </v>
<v Speaker 2>written about those videos in the last </v>

1738
01:26:50.380 --> 01:26:50.380
<v Speaker 2>two months.</v>

1739
01:26:50.870 --> 01:26:53.660
<v Speaker 4>And what's the general consensus are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1740
01:26:53.661 --> 01:26:56.000
<v Speaker 4>are they going to begin with</v>

1741
01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:57.650
<v Speaker 2>to begin with?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the first two weeks,</v>

1742
01:26:57.690 --> 01:27:00.740
<v Speaker 2>which was the most stressful part of </v>
<v Speaker 2>this for me,</v>

1743
01:27:00.741 --> 01:27:02.060
<v Speaker 2>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1744
01:27:02.210 --> 01:27:05.210
<v Speaker 2>I would say the bulk of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the press articles were,</v>

1745
01:27:05.600 --> 01:27:07.020
<v Speaker 2>were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1746
01:27:07.850 --> 01:27:11.630
<v Speaker 2>ran contrary to my views and their basic</v>
<v Speaker 2>theme was something like,</v>

1747
01:27:11.840 --> 01:27:14.180
<v Speaker 2>why doesn't the mean professor just play</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nice?</v>

1748
01:27:14.540 --> 01:27:16.100
<v Speaker 2>It was something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

1749
01:27:16.550 --> 01:27:21.550
<v Speaker 2>but luckily,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fortunately I seem to maneuver past </v>

1750
01:27:21.921 --> 01:27:25.520
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then people started to actually read</v>

1751
01:27:25.521 --> 01:27:26.580
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1752
01:27:26.690 --> 01:27:30.920
<v Speaker 2>the policies that I was speaking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>and started to think about them.</v>

1753
01:27:31.370 --> 01:27:36.170
<v Speaker 2>And one thing about the press is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're actually fairly in favor of free</v>

1754
01:27:36.171 --> 01:27:40.340
<v Speaker 2>expression given that that's their </v>
<v Speaker 2>absolute bread and butter.</v>

1755
01:27:40.940 --> 01:27:42.310
<v Speaker 2>And so the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1756
01:27:42.560 --> 01:27:47.560
<v Speaker 2>the tenor shifted and I would say the </v>
<v Speaker 2>overwhelming majority of press articles </v>

1757
01:27:47.560 --> 01:27:49.820
<v Speaker 2>in the La sueur apart from the first two</v>
<v Speaker 2>weeks have been,</v>

1758
01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:51.990
<v Speaker 2>have been positive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1759
01:27:52.010 --> 01:27:53.360
<v Speaker 2>that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The</v>

1760
01:27:53.820 --> 01:27:57.510
<v Speaker 4>what you've done in your youtube videos,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I think is an amazing forum,</v>

1761
01:27:57.780 --> 01:28:02.780
<v Speaker 4>particularly for what you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is document and describe in great detail</v>

1762
01:28:02.911 --> 01:28:07.911
<v Speaker 4>the issues with every single one of </v>
<v Speaker 4>these problems with no interruption and </v>

1763
01:28:08.161 --> 01:28:09.870
<v Speaker 4>I think that's one of the best things </v>
<v Speaker 4>about it.</v>

1764
01:28:09.871 --> 01:28:14.871
<v Speaker 4>The fact that there's not really a whole</v>
<v Speaker 4>lot of forums that will give you the </v>

1765
01:28:14.871 --> 01:28:18.441
<v Speaker 4>chance to express yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've seen some of your videos have </v>

1766
01:28:18.441 --> 01:28:20.601
<v Speaker 4>hundreds of thousands of views and </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's not a whole lot of forums where </v>

1767
01:28:20.601 --> 01:28:23.190
<v Speaker 4>you can do that and speak for A.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean they're all like an hour long.</v>

1768
01:28:23.191 --> 01:28:23.850
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know,</v>

1769
01:28:23.910 --> 01:28:24.580
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's.</v>

1770
01:28:24.581 --> 01:28:25.380
<v Speaker 4>It's amazing.</v>

1771
01:28:25.650 --> 01:28:26.750
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Youtube is.</v>

1772
01:28:26.790 --> 01:28:28.140
<v Speaker 2>Youtube is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1773
01:28:28.410 --> 01:28:29.610
<v Speaker 2>I started,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I posted,</v>

1774
01:28:29.611 --> 01:28:34.611
<v Speaker 2>started posting my lectures on Youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my classroom lectures in 2013 and in </v>

1775
01:28:34.611 --> 01:28:39.081
<v Speaker 2>really bare bones form.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're just an ipad recording of me </v>

1776
01:28:39.081 --> 01:28:42.471
<v Speaker 2>lecturing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't edit in the slides of the </v>

1777
01:28:42.471 --> 01:28:42.600
<v Speaker 2>images partly because that's very time </v>
<v Speaker 2>consuming,</v>

1778
01:28:43.170 --> 01:28:48.170
<v Speaker 2>but then I watched it for about two </v>
<v Speaker 2>years and by September of this year it </v>

1779
01:28:48.170 --> 01:28:50.460
<v Speaker 2>declined to about a million views.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I really started thinking about</v>

1780
01:28:50.461 --> 01:28:52.860
<v Speaker 2>youtube because youtube was cute cat </v>
<v Speaker 2>videos,</v>

1781
01:28:52.861 --> 01:28:57.861
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Justin bieber songs for a very long </v>

1782
01:28:57.861 --> 01:28:59.961
<v Speaker 2>period of time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not that anymore and that's </v>

1783
01:28:59.961 --> 01:29:01.230
<v Speaker 2>probably been about two years or maybe </v>
<v Speaker 2>two and a half years.</v>

1784
01:29:01.620 --> 01:29:05.130
<v Speaker 2>But then I realized that Youtube is </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually a revolution that's as,</v>

1785
01:29:05.490 --> 01:29:08.760
<v Speaker 2>as overwhelming as the Gutenberg press </v>
<v Speaker 2>revolution.</v>

1786
01:29:08.761 --> 01:29:13.761
<v Speaker 2>Gutenberg invented the printing press </v>
<v Speaker 2>and because for the first time in human </v>

1787
01:29:13.761 --> 01:29:18.291
<v Speaker 2>history,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lecture can have the same reach and </v>

1788
01:29:18.291 --> 01:29:22.290
<v Speaker 2>the same longevity as a book and it's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot easier for people to listen and that</v>

1789
01:29:22.440 --> 01:29:25.170
<v Speaker 2>the time lag publication is basically </v>
<v Speaker 2>zero,</v>

1790
01:29:25.320 --> 01:29:25.680
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1791
01:29:25.800 --> 01:29:30.800
<v Speaker 2>I mean because you can do it live I </v>
<v Speaker 2>guess as we are right now or you can </v>

1792
01:29:30.800 --> 01:29:31.470
<v Speaker 2>post it in a day or two after publishing</v>
<v Speaker 2>it and,</v>

1793
01:29:31.480 --> 01:29:35.010
<v Speaker 2>and you have access to this insanely </v>
<v Speaker 2>large audience.</v>

1794
01:29:35.011 --> 01:29:40.011
<v Speaker 2>And the other thing that's really </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting about youtube with regards </v>

1795
01:29:40.011 --> 01:29:40.380
<v Speaker 2>to my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially the more academic videos,</v>

1796
01:29:40.381 --> 01:29:42.510
<v Speaker 2>is there's only one reason that people </v>
<v Speaker 2>are watching them.</v>

1797
01:29:42.690 --> 01:29:45.300
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not the production quality.</v>

1798
01:29:45.670 --> 01:29:47.520
<v Speaker 2>The audio is okay and I'm a good </v>
<v Speaker 2>speaker,</v>

1799
01:29:47.521 --> 01:29:52.521
<v Speaker 2>but it's not the production quality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The reason they're watching them is </v>

1800
01:29:52.521 --> 01:29:55.551
<v Speaker 2>because they want to know and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that's really cool about </v>

1801
01:29:55.551 --> 01:29:58.881
<v Speaker 2>youtube and youtube also seems to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>quite skeptical about advanced </v>

1802
01:29:58.881 --> 01:29:59.070
<v Speaker 2>production values.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1803
01:29:59.071 --> 01:30:04.071
<v Speaker 2>the people who are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are popular are often people like </v>

1804
01:30:04.071 --> 01:30:07.010
<v Speaker 2>you who are basically sitting there </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking and everyone's listening.</v>

1805
01:30:07.020 --> 01:30:07.440
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1806
01:30:07.441 --> 01:30:12.441
<v Speaker 2>well people are actually talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>something and this turns out to be </v>

1807
01:30:12.441 --> 01:30:15.621
<v Speaker 2>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the rebirth of genuine </v>

1808
01:30:15.621 --> 01:30:15.621
<v Speaker 2>journalism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

1809
01:30:15.621 --> 01:30:18.210
<v Speaker 2>youtube is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God only knows what youtube is,</v>

1810
01:30:18.510 --> 01:30:18.840
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>

1811
01:30:19.100 --> 01:30:20.720
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's international revolution.</v>

1812
01:30:20.750 --> 01:30:25.750
<v Speaker 4>I believe you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think the Internet in general is </v>

1813
01:30:25.750 --> 01:30:28.720
<v Speaker 4>this really new thing in terms of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>ability to express yourself.</v>

1814
01:30:28.761 --> 01:30:33.320
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's only existed for 20 plus </v>
<v Speaker 4>years and in terms of human history,</v>

1815
01:30:33.321 --> 01:30:36.820
<v Speaker 4>that's a blink of an eye and it's only </v>
<v Speaker 4>really been used as you,</v>

1816
01:30:36.990 --> 01:30:40.250
<v Speaker 4>you've described over the last couple of</v>
<v Speaker 4>years in this form.</v>

1817
01:30:40.970 --> 01:30:42.020
<v Speaker 4>And I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1818
01:30:42.290 --> 01:30:47.290
<v Speaker 4>it also is responsible,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think for a great deal of the rise of </v>

1819
01:30:47.290 --> 01:30:48.420
<v Speaker 4>the popularity of the social justice </v>
<v Speaker 4>movement.</v>

1820
01:30:48.450 --> 01:30:53.450
<v Speaker 4>I think it's a double edge sword.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think these echo chambers and these </v>

1821
01:30:53.450 --> 01:30:56.621
<v Speaker 4>people that do find these patterns of </v>
<v Speaker 4>behavior that they subscribe to,</v>

1822
01:30:57.620 --> 01:31:02.620
<v Speaker 4>and I think that is part of the problem </v>
<v Speaker 4>with ideologies in general is that </v>

1823
01:31:02.620 --> 01:31:05.300
<v Speaker 4>instead of thinking for yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you subscribe to a predetermined pattern</v>

1824
01:31:05.301 --> 01:31:09.380
<v Speaker 4>or behavior and you will lock in like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is what I'm supposed to believe.</v>

1825
01:31:09.380 --> 01:31:14.060
<v Speaker 4>This is what I'm supposed to enforce.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is what I'm supposed to side with,</v>

1826
01:31:14.240 --> 01:31:19.240
<v Speaker 4>and you go with that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of the good things about the </v>

1827
01:31:19.240 --> 01:31:22.451
<v Speaker 4>internet is that it is potentially </v>
<v Speaker 4>possible to see contrary viewpoints and </v>

1828
01:31:24.021 --> 01:31:29.021
<v Speaker 4>analyze them in the comfort of your own </v>
<v Speaker 4>home and being by yourself and and </v>

1829
01:31:29.021 --> 01:31:31.370
<v Speaker 4>looking at maybe one of your videos and </v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe someone come to you and I'm sure a</v>

1830
01:31:31.371 --> 01:31:34.910
<v Speaker 4>lot have come to your videos in anger,</v>
<v Speaker 4>mad at you,</v>

1831
01:31:35.090 --> 01:31:40.090
<v Speaker 4>and then listen to your points of view </v>
<v Speaker 4>and listen to how clearly you've </v>

1832
01:31:40.090 --> 01:31:42.820
<v Speaker 4>established all of these positions and </v>
<v Speaker 4>what what you actually feel is the </v>

1833
01:31:43.161 --> 01:31:45.230
<v Speaker 4>problem with these positions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In a very,</v>

1834
01:31:45.680 --> 01:31:49.550
<v Speaker 4>very calm and very rational and a very </v>
<v Speaker 4>well educated point of view.</v>

1835
01:31:49.910 --> 01:31:54.910
<v Speaker 4>I think the these people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have the potential to be at least </v>

1836
01:31:54.910 --> 01:31:56.270
<v Speaker 4>informed it because you're the.</v>

1837
01:31:56.720 --> 01:31:59.920
<v Speaker 2>I've had lots of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had lots of letters maybe,</v>

1838
01:31:59.921 --> 01:32:01.060
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>2,500</v>

1839
01:32:01.061 --> 01:32:06.061
<v Speaker 2>letters maybe to my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to my email accounts now about this and </v>

1840
01:32:06.061 --> 01:32:08.980
<v Speaker 2>a very large number of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe maybe 200 letters,</v>

1841
01:32:08.981 --> 01:32:13.981
<v Speaker 2>150 to 200 have been from people on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>radical left who've written to me and </v>

1842
01:32:13.981 --> 01:32:17.620
<v Speaker 2>said that they can no longer speak </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the authoritarian types,</v>

1843
01:32:17.621 --> 01:32:22.621
<v Speaker 2>the PC authoritarians have got.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So controlling that there once </v>

1844
01:32:22.621 --> 01:32:26.240
<v Speaker 2>fashionable position is now been deemed </v>
<v Speaker 2>unacceptable and they,</v>

1845
01:32:26.310 --> 01:32:28.120
<v Speaker 2>they're alienated and it excluded.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1846
01:32:28.121 --> 01:32:30.550
<v Speaker 2>you see that happening with feminists </v>
<v Speaker 2>like Jermaine greer.</v>

1847
01:32:31.220 --> 01:32:34.690
<v Speaker 2>I mean Jermaine greer who's been banned </v>
<v Speaker 2>from campuses,</v>

1848
01:32:34.880 --> 01:32:39.880
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's not very happy with the idea that </v>

1849
01:32:39.880 --> 01:32:40.540
<v Speaker 2>being a woman is something that's been </v>
<v Speaker 2>reduced to a whim,</v>

1850
01:32:41.050 --> 01:32:46.050
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because she thinks that there's more to </v>

1851
01:32:46.050 --> 01:32:46.050
<v Speaker 2>being a woman than mirror subjective </v>
<v Speaker 2>choice.</v>

1852
01:32:46.050 --> 01:32:48.130
<v Speaker 2>While that's no longer a tenable </v>
<v Speaker 2>viewpoint on the left.</v>

1853
01:32:48.131 --> 01:32:50.590
<v Speaker 2>And so people who hold that view point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many of them are feminists,</v>

1854
01:32:50.591 --> 01:32:55.300
<v Speaker 2>are no longer getting along with the say</v>
<v Speaker 2>radical gender bender,</v>

1855
01:32:55.301 --> 01:32:58.570
<v Speaker 2>activist types who've who've got center </v>
<v Speaker 2>stage at the moment.</v>

1856
01:32:59.200 --> 01:32:59.590
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

1857
01:32:59.730 --> 01:33:04.730
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Christine Summers has the same issue </v>

1858
01:33:04.730 --> 01:33:07.401
<v Speaker 4>with that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's a feminist and she calls herself </v>

1859
01:33:07.401 --> 01:33:10.041
<v Speaker 4>the factual feminist and she pushes back</v>
<v Speaker 4>against and what her perspective is is </v>

1860
01:33:10.041 --> 01:33:14.661
<v Speaker 4>instead of embracing these false </v>
<v Speaker 4>narratives and running with them as if </v>

1861
01:33:14.661 --> 01:33:18.240
<v Speaker 4>they're the facts and and and just using</v>
<v Speaker 4>that to reinforce your ideology.</v>

1862
01:33:18.540 --> 01:33:20.940
<v Speaker 4>She saying that does feminism a </v>
<v Speaker 4>disservice?</v>

1863
01:33:20.941 --> 01:33:25.941
<v Speaker 4>Let's look at the actual reality of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>situation and let's look at it from a </v>

1864
01:33:25.941 --> 01:33:30.060
<v Speaker 4>balanced and objective perspective and </v>
<v Speaker 4>she gets so much hate for them.</v>

1865
01:33:30.300 --> 01:33:32.430
<v Speaker 4>The idea of being rational and </v>
<v Speaker 4>objective.</v>

1866
01:33:32.510 --> 01:33:37.510
<v Speaker 2>Well that that's because as far as the </v>
<v Speaker 2>postmodern social justice warriors are </v>

1867
01:33:37.510 --> 01:33:41.321
<v Speaker 2>concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are just code words for </v>

1868
01:33:41.321 --> 01:33:41.321
<v Speaker 2>oppression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no object.</v>

1869
01:33:41.321 --> 01:33:43.040
<v Speaker 2>You've got to remember this with regards</v>
<v Speaker 2>to having these sorts of arguments.</v>

1870
01:33:43.580 --> 01:33:48.580
<v Speaker 2>When you say objective and rational,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's predicated on your implicit </v>

1871
01:33:48.580 --> 01:33:53.531
<v Speaker 2>belief that there is such a thing as the</v>
<v Speaker 2>objective and there is such a thing as </v>

1872
01:33:53.531 --> 01:33:54.980
<v Speaker 2>rational.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the radical postmodernists,</v>

1873
01:33:55.220 --> 01:33:57.590
<v Speaker 2>they do not buy that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not at all,</v>

1874
01:33:58.520 --> 01:34:00.080
<v Speaker 2>not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As far as they're concerned.</v>

1875
01:34:00.110 --> 01:34:02.240
<v Speaker 2>That's just another power game on your </v>
<v Speaker 2>part.</v>

1876
01:34:02.870 --> 01:34:06.680
<v Speaker 2>And Bill built into the laws like bill </v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] in Canada now in the same,</v>

1877
01:34:06.681 --> 01:34:11.681
<v Speaker 2>in the laws in New York City that </v>
<v Speaker 2>governed the use of these gender </v>

1878
01:34:11.681 --> 01:34:14.381
<v Speaker 2>pronouns built into the law is the idea </v>
<v Speaker 2>that there's no biological a foundation </v>

1879
01:34:16.161 --> 01:34:19.190
<v Speaker 2>for your identity and that it's all </v>
<v Speaker 2>purely subjective.</v>

1880
01:34:19.580 --> 01:34:22.880
<v Speaker 2>They built that into the law,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no objective reality,</v>

1881
01:34:23.030 --> 01:34:26.990
<v Speaker 2>no biology that's going to unfold over </v>
<v Speaker 2>the next 20 years</v>

1882
01:34:28.070 --> 01:34:29.200
<v Speaker 4>or not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1883
01:34:29.220 --> 01:34:34.220
<v Speaker 4>isn't it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>isn't it possible that these kinds of </v>

1884
01:34:34.220 --> 01:34:36.611
<v Speaker 4>discussions and that your videos and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then all the people that agree and all </v>

1885
01:34:36.611 --> 01:34:40.031
<v Speaker 4>the people that are pushing back against</v>
<v Speaker 4>this can have some sort of an effect on </v>

1886
01:34:40.031 --> 01:34:40.031
<v Speaker 4>this movement</v>

1887
01:34:40.360 --> 01:34:42.640
<v Speaker 2>I think?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or do you think to say yes?</v>

1888
01:34:43.240 --> 01:34:45.670
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you cynical about the future?</v>

1889
01:34:45.671 --> 01:34:46.360
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1890
01:34:46.390 --> 01:34:48.970
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not at all cynical about the future.</v>

1891
01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.550
<v Speaker 2>I am cynical about my ability to predict</v>
<v Speaker 2>the future.</v>

1892
01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:56.110
<v Speaker 2>Like when I was younger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>much younger back in the 19 eighties.</v>

1893
01:34:56.111 --> 01:34:57.010
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was very,</v>

1894
01:34:57.020 --> 01:34:59.540
<v Speaker 2>very concerned about the possibility of </v>
<v Speaker 2>nuclear war,</v>

1895
01:34:59.990 --> 01:35:01.610
<v Speaker 2>but by a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by yes,</v>

1896
01:35:01.611 --> 01:35:02.630
<v Speaker 2>as we all were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1897
01:35:02.640 --> 01:35:04.850
<v Speaker 2>By bought about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by about the mid nineties though,</v>

1898
01:35:04.851 --> 01:35:09.851
<v Speaker 2>I realized that things were in such a </v>
<v Speaker 2>state of chaotic flux that the one thing</v>

1899
01:35:10.491 --> 01:35:14.690
<v Speaker 2>I can be certain of was that no matter </v>
<v Speaker 2>what I was afraid of with regards to the</v>

1900
01:35:14.691 --> 01:35:19.691
<v Speaker 2>future,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that isn't what was going to happen and </v>

1901
01:35:19.691 --> 01:35:22.631
<v Speaker 2>so I'm not cynical about the future,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I do believe that we're in an </v>

1902
01:35:22.631 --> 01:35:25.871
<v Speaker 2>unprecedented state of indeterminate </v>
<v Speaker 2>indeterminacy and flux and God only </v>

1903
01:35:27.531 --> 01:35:28.580
<v Speaker 2>knows what could happen.</v>

1904
01:35:29.360 --> 01:35:34.360
<v Speaker 2>I'm not having said that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't say I'm optimistic about the </v>

1905
01:35:34.360 --> 01:35:37.130
<v Speaker 2>possibility that the universities will </v>
<v Speaker 2>reform themselves because I think that.</v>

1906
01:35:37.520 --> 01:35:42.520
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even with the free speech debate that </v>

1907
01:35:42.520 --> 01:35:44.590
<v Speaker 2>that the University of Toronto hosted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they did three politically correct </v>

1908
01:35:44.590 --> 01:35:45.940
<v Speaker 2>things during the debate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>

1909
01:35:45.970 --> 01:35:50.970
<v Speaker 2>which I thought was really interesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>because if I would have staged a debate </v>

1910
01:35:50.970 --> 01:35:52.760
<v Speaker 2>and been working on their side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

1911
01:35:53.240 --> 01:35:55.370
<v Speaker 2>I would have said strategically </v>
<v Speaker 2>speaking,</v>

1912
01:35:56.030 --> 01:36:01.030
<v Speaker 2>no politically correct maneuvering </v>
<v Speaker 2>during this debate because all it's </v>

1913
01:36:01.030 --> 01:36:02.000
<v Speaker 2>gonna do is discredit us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that isn't what happened.</v>

1914
01:36:02.001 --> 01:36:07.001
<v Speaker 2>The university opened up by noting that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the land on which we were having the </v>

1915
01:36:07.001 --> 01:36:11.441
<v Speaker 2>debate was once the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was one's property owned by the </v>

1916
01:36:11.441 --> 01:36:14.891
<v Speaker 2>original native set native Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is something I find it boring </v>

1917
01:36:14.960 --> 01:36:19.960
<v Speaker 2>because on the one hand we took it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>now on the other hand we want to be </v>

1918
01:36:19.960 --> 01:36:21.170
<v Speaker 2>friends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like that's.</v>

1919
01:36:21.410 --> 01:36:25.370
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you get to have both sides</v>
<v Speaker 2>of that moral play at the same time,</v>

1920
01:36:25.550 --> 01:36:30.550
<v Speaker 2>but that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how the university opened the </v>

1921
01:36:30.550 --> 01:36:32.501
<v Speaker 2>debate and then the next thing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened was that they announced that </v>

1922
01:36:32.501 --> 01:36:35.681
<v Speaker 2>there would be counselors waiting </v>
<v Speaker 2>outside for anybody who was too </v>

1923
01:36:35.681 --> 01:36:37.340
<v Speaker 2>traumatized by the contents of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>discussion and then they closed.</v>

1924
01:36:37.790 --> 01:36:41.270
<v Speaker 2>They closed by announcing the Trans Day </v>
<v Speaker 2>of remembrance,</v>

1925
01:36:41.550 --> 01:36:42.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and but,</v>

1926
01:36:42.400 --> 01:36:44.810
<v Speaker 2>and the reason I'm pointing this out is </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it,</v>

1927
01:36:44.870 --> 01:36:47.630
<v Speaker 2>it just shows you the fact that those </v>
<v Speaker 2>things happened.</v>

1928
01:36:48.410 --> 01:36:53.410
<v Speaker 2>They weren't even strategic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just how things are at the </v>

1929
01:36:53.410 --> 01:36:56.651
<v Speaker 2>university and they didn't even notice </v>
<v Speaker 2>that people were going to turn </v>

1930
01:36:56.651 --> 01:36:57.620
<v Speaker 2>themselves inside out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Noticing that saying,</v>

1931
01:36:57.621 --> 01:36:58.970
<v Speaker 2>well God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is so biased.</v>

1932
01:36:58.971 --> 01:37:01.100
<v Speaker 2>I can hardly believe it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is exactly what happened.</v>

1933
01:37:01.400 --> 01:37:06.400
<v Speaker 2>That's how saturated the universities </v>
<v Speaker 2>are with this kind of thinking and I </v>

1934
01:37:06.400 --> 01:37:10.151
<v Speaker 2>don't have any idea what can reverse </v>
<v Speaker 2>that collective decisions on the part of</v>

1935
01:37:10.611 --> 01:37:14.870
<v Speaker 2>citizens a to stop sending their </v>
<v Speaker 2>children there be to stop donating money</v>

1936
01:37:14.871 --> 01:37:19.871
<v Speaker 2>and leaving it in wills and see to </v>
<v Speaker 2>pressure politicians like in my wilder </v>

1937
01:37:19.871 --> 01:37:24.351
<v Speaker 2>moments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think cut the funding to the </v>

1938
01:37:24.351 --> 01:37:26.441
<v Speaker 2>universities by 25 percent and let the </v>
<v Speaker 2>faculty have a war about what's </v>

1939
01:37:26.441 --> 01:37:30.410
<v Speaker 2>important and maybe what would be </v>
<v Speaker 2>leftover with what the university should</v>

1940
01:37:30.411 --> 01:37:30.740
<v Speaker 2>be.</v>

1941
01:37:31.220 --> 01:37:36.080
<v Speaker 2>But I really think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the exception of the science,</v>

1942
01:37:36.081 --> 01:37:41.081
<v Speaker 2>technology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>engineering and mathematics ends of </v>

1943
01:37:41.081 --> 01:37:41.081
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's come to that.</v>

1944
01:37:41.081 --> 01:37:45.760
<v Speaker 2>Don't you think that what you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're making these videos is in a </v>

1945
01:37:45.760 --> 01:37:50.201
<v Speaker 2>sense branching out a way from just a </v>
<v Speaker 2>university and teaching online because </v>

1946
01:37:50.451 --> 01:37:51.410
<v Speaker 2>you all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

1947
01:37:51.411 --> 01:37:56.411
<v Speaker 2>I think that that you could make a case </v>
<v Speaker 2>that that's where the university is </v>

1948
01:37:56.411 --> 01:37:58.380
<v Speaker 2>because that's where people are going </v>
<v Speaker 2>just to get knowledge.</v>

1949
01:37:58.710 --> 01:38:00.960
<v Speaker 2>They have no other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have no other motivation</v>

1950
01:38:02.190 --> 01:38:06.990
<v Speaker 1>and this is a new thing obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at one point in time,</v>

1951
01:38:06.991 --> 01:38:08.530
<v Speaker 1>so it was the printing press,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1952
01:38:08.550 --> 01:38:09.120
<v Speaker 1>And this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

1953
01:38:09.170 --> 01:38:14.170
<v Speaker 1>this new ability to disseminate </v>
<v Speaker 1>information seems to me to be more </v>

1954
01:38:14.170 --> 01:38:15.390
<v Speaker 1>effective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more accessible,</v>

1955
01:38:15.391 --> 01:38:16.580
<v Speaker 1>more reasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1956
01:38:17.110 --> 01:38:20.530
<v Speaker 1>and it's entirely possible that what </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're looking at is the future of</v>

1957
01:38:20.680 --> 01:38:21.790
<v Speaker 2>kg.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It could be,</v>

1958
01:38:21.880 --> 01:38:26.880
<v Speaker 2>it could be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I've just been spending a lot of </v>

1959
01:38:26.880 --> 01:38:29.041
<v Speaker 2>time in the last month or so also </v>
<v Speaker 2>concentrating on video editing and so I </v>

1960
01:38:29.291 --> 01:38:32.670
<v Speaker 2>spent about 10 hours this week video </v>
<v Speaker 2>editing about an hour,</v>

1961
01:38:32.760 --> 01:38:36.460
<v Speaker 2>a discussion with a Russian Orthodox </v>
<v Speaker 2>icon carver.</v>

1962
01:38:36.461 --> 01:38:40.620
<v Speaker 2>Weirdly enough that I'm going to launch </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the next three or four days and it,</v>

1963
01:38:40.720 --> 01:38:41.320
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

1964
01:38:41.370 --> 01:38:46.370
<v Speaker 2>we discussed things that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are very image heavy and so I've </v>

1965
01:38:46.370 --> 01:38:50.110
<v Speaker 2>been cutting in a lot of images and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>is a technology that far supersedes what</v>

1966
01:38:50.380 --> 01:38:52.060
<v Speaker 2>I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like lecturing and lecturing.</v>

1967
01:38:52.150 --> 01:38:57.150
<v Speaker 2>Lectures can be very effective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but basically with youtube you can turn </v>

1968
01:38:57.641 --> 01:39:02.641
<v Speaker 2>your lecture into a documentary and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of teaching 100 people you can </v>

1969
01:39:02.641 --> 01:39:05.320
<v Speaker 2>teach 50,000.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like that's a lot different.</v>

1970
01:39:05.740 --> 01:39:08.290
<v Speaker 2>That's a lot different and it's up there</v>
<v Speaker 2>permanently.</v>

1971
01:39:08.500 --> 01:39:09.670
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that 50,000</v>

1972
01:39:09.671 --> 01:39:14.200
<v Speaker 1>can grow and grow and grow and as it </v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes more spread and shared,</v>

1973
01:39:14.780 --> 01:39:17.740
<v Speaker 1>the also the discussions about it become</v>
<v Speaker 1>more varied.</v>

1974
01:39:17.860 --> 01:39:22.860
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well three more than 3 million people </v>

1975
01:39:22.860 --> 01:39:24.940
<v Speaker 2>have watched some element of this in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>last couple of months and in September I</v>

1976
01:39:24.941 --> 01:39:27.910
<v Speaker 2>had about 9,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>subscribers.</v>

1977
01:39:27.911 --> 01:39:30.130
<v Speaker 2>That took me about two years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three years to build.</v>

1978
01:39:30.131 --> 01:39:33.040
<v Speaker 2>And one of my ambitions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was kind of a tongue and cheek and</v>

1979
01:39:33.041 --> 01:39:34.890
<v Speaker 2>comical ambition is I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1980
01:39:34.930 --> 01:39:39.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet I can get more subscribers in the </v>

1981
01:39:39.930 --> 01:39:39.930
<v Speaker 2>next three years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then the UFT has students.</v>

1982
01:39:40.030 --> 01:39:41.500
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's pretty interesting,</v>

1983
01:39:41.501 --> 01:39:44.500
<v Speaker 2>is like all of a sudden I could have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>body of students,</v>

1984
01:39:44.501 --> 01:39:47.820
<v Speaker 2>let's say that's larger than the entire </v>
<v Speaker 2>university's like what?</v>

1985
01:39:47.821 --> 01:39:49.930
<v Speaker 2>We'll just exactly what the hell does </v>
<v Speaker 2>that mean?</v>

1986
01:39:50.140 --> 01:39:52.480
<v Speaker 2>And the answer to that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what that means.</v>

1987
01:39:52.960 --> 01:39:57.960
<v Speaker 2>Who knows what that means,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but one of the other perverse things </v>

1988
01:39:57.960 --> 01:40:01.951
<v Speaker 2>that happened while I was being warned </v>
<v Speaker 2>and a cautioned by the university was </v>

1989
01:40:04.421 --> 01:40:08.200
<v Speaker 2>that my subscriber base grew from 9,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>to $65,000.</v>

1990
01:40:08.200 --> 01:40:13.200
<v Speaker 2>So now I have more youtube subscribers </v>
<v Speaker 2>than the University of Toronto has </v>

1991
01:40:13.200 --> 01:40:13.200
<v Speaker 2>students.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1992
01:40:13.200 --> 01:40:14.470
<v Speaker 2>so then I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well hell,</v>

1993
01:40:14.471 --> 01:40:19.471
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could do a whole series on </v>

1994
01:40:19.471 --> 01:40:20.911
<v Speaker 2>Solzhenitsyn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could do a whole series on George </v>

1995
01:40:20.911 --> 01:40:23.370
<v Speaker 2>Orwell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could do a whole series on the Aldous </v>

1996
01:40:23.370 --> 01:40:25.170
<v Speaker 2>Huxley.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could do a whole series on archetipal </v>

1997
01:40:25.170 --> 01:40:27.010
<v Speaker 2>biblical stories and half of me thinks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1998
01:40:27.011 --> 01:40:32.011
<v Speaker 2>if 50,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are going to watch each of those </v>

1999
01:40:32.011 --> 01:40:32.920
<v Speaker 2>and I can turn them into documentaries </v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of just lectures.</v>

2000
01:40:33.550 --> 01:40:38.550
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that's what I should be doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I couldn't write a book with that </v>

2001
01:40:38.550 --> 01:40:38.920
<v Speaker 2>much reach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>

2002
01:40:38.921 --> 01:40:40.630
<v Speaker 2>Reach crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2003
01:40:40.631 --> 01:40:41.140
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2004
01:40:41.710 --> 01:40:43.960
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's revolutionary.</v>

2005
01:40:44.050 --> 01:40:46.150
<v Speaker 2>I believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe it's revolutionary.</v>

2006
01:40:46.420 --> 01:40:48.550
<v Speaker 1>I believe it is too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I believe no one saw it coming and I</v>

2007
01:40:48.551 --> 01:40:53.551
<v Speaker 1>think it's such a new thing that we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>all just sort of starting to get a </v>

2008
01:40:53.551 --> 01:40:54.010
<v Speaker 1>handle on how to it and what it's</v>

2009
01:40:54.010 --> 01:40:54.890
<v Speaker 2>capable of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2010
01:40:54.910 --> 01:40:57.100
<v Speaker 2>Well it was like the Internet was for </v>
<v Speaker 2>pornography.</v>

2011
01:40:57.310 --> 01:41:02.310
<v Speaker 2>Well that changed quick and youtube was </v>
<v Speaker 2>for cute cat videos and that changed </v>

2012
01:41:02.310 --> 01:41:06.901
<v Speaker 2>quick too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't know what the technology is </v>

2013
01:41:06.901 --> 01:41:06.901
<v Speaker 2>going to do.</v>

2014
01:41:06.901 --> 01:41:10.210
<v Speaker 4>Well it's also a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how much you've paid </v>

2015
01:41:10.210 --> 01:41:11.390
<v Speaker 4>attention to virtual reality or how much</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've experimented with it,</v>

2016
01:41:11.391 --> 01:41:16.391
<v Speaker 4>but my good friend Duncan trussell has </v>
<v Speaker 4>one of those htc vives and uh,</v>

2017
01:41:17.740 --> 01:41:20.660
<v Speaker 4>I put it on over his house.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He runs a podcast and we,</v>

2018
01:41:20.900 --> 01:41:25.900
<v Speaker 4>we played with it for about an hour and </v>
<v Speaker 4>a half and then we did a podcast and I </v>

2019
01:41:25.900 --> 01:41:28.580
<v Speaker 4>am thoroughly convinced,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially now with a new phones,</v>

2020
01:41:28.581 --> 01:41:33.320
<v Speaker 4>there's a phone that I just got called </v>
<v Speaker 4>the Google Pixel and it comes.</v>

2021
01:41:33.350 --> 01:41:37.850
<v Speaker 4>You can buy it with this headset,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you slide the phone into the headset,</v>

2022
01:41:37.851 --> 01:41:42.851
<v Speaker 4>you put on this virtual reality a </v>
<v Speaker 4>program and you're watching a virtual </v>

2023
01:41:42.891 --> 01:41:47.891
<v Speaker 4>reality show on your phone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a regular phone that fits in your </v>

2024
01:41:47.891 --> 01:41:49.490
<v Speaker 4>pocket,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just slides to the headset.</v>

2025
01:41:49.820 --> 01:41:54.820
<v Speaker 4>You could do not just a two dimensional </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing where you're showing a lecture and</v>

2026
01:41:54.831 --> 01:41:59.831
<v Speaker 4>showing images and having a discussion </v>
<v Speaker 4>and putting these images in the </v>

2027
01:41:59.831 --> 01:42:03.011
<v Speaker 4>background.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're in the foreground and have the </v>

2028
01:42:03.011 --> 01:42:04.511
<v Speaker 4>audio over it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but rather you could have three </v>

2029
01:42:04.511 --> 01:42:06.320
<v Speaker 4>dimensional things where you could show </v>
<v Speaker 4>a city of village a mountain range.</v>

2030
01:42:06.321 --> 01:42:10.700
<v Speaker 4>You could show a geometric patterns you </v>
<v Speaker 4>could get involved in.</v>

2031
01:42:10.850 --> 01:42:15.850
<v Speaker 4>I mean it could be used for a million </v>
<v Speaker 4>different things and not just for </v>

2032
01:42:15.850 --> 01:42:18.330
<v Speaker 4>entertainment but also for education and</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that is,</v>

2033
01:42:18.480 --> 01:42:19.880
<v Speaker 4>that's the next step I think.</v>

2034
01:42:21.490 --> 01:42:25.210
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an unbelievably fascinating new.</v>

2035
01:42:25.270 --> 01:42:25.960
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you must be.</v>

2036
01:42:26.200 --> 01:42:30.730
<v Speaker 2>Must be shocked to some degree at how </v>
<v Speaker 2>popular your podcasts have become.</v>

2037
01:42:30.731 --> 01:42:31.540
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have,</v>

2038
01:42:32.080 --> 01:42:35.350
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how many people on Youtube </v>
<v Speaker 2>have larger subscriber base than you,</v>

2039
01:42:35.351 --> 01:42:37.870
<v Speaker 2>but it's not that many.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I mean,</v>

2040
01:42:37.871 --> 01:42:42.871
<v Speaker 2>how.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you account for that and does </v>

2041
01:42:42.871 --> 01:42:42.871
<v Speaker 2>that surprise you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's surprising,</v>

2042
01:42:42.871 --> 01:42:46.891
<v Speaker 2>but it's that this whole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this whole podcast thing is very </v>

2043
01:42:46.891 --> 01:42:46.891
<v Speaker 2>surprising,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's um,</v>

2044
01:42:47.260 --> 01:42:52.260
<v Speaker 2>the youtube is only a small fraction of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the amount of people that actually </v>

2045
01:42:52.260 --> 01:42:55.120
<v Speaker 2>listen to the podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The numbers of the downloads are insane.</v>

2046
01:42:55.300 --> 01:42:56.710
<v Speaker 2>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was the last month's numbers?</v>

2047
01:42:57.100 --> 01:43:01.220
<v Speaker 2>Was the youtube was around 12 million </v>
<v Speaker 2>for the month and audio is at $60.</v>

2048
01:43:01.221 --> 01:43:02.440
<v Speaker 2>Million.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2049
01:43:02.500 --> 01:43:03.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't done,</v>

2050
01:43:03.580 --> 01:43:07.060
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't played vr anywhere near enough</v>

2051
01:43:07.061 --> 01:43:09.180
<v Speaker 2>with turning my online lectures into </v>
<v Speaker 2>podcasts.</v>

2052
01:43:09.200 --> 01:43:10.990
<v Speaker 2>He's definitely should.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You definitely should.</v>

2053
01:43:10.991 --> 01:43:11.470
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2054
01:43:11.500 --> 01:43:16.500
<v Speaker 2>a lot of it you could listen to when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're in a car or when you're </v>

2055
01:43:16.500 --> 01:43:16.500
<v Speaker 2>exercising or that sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2056
01:43:16.500 --> 01:43:16.610
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

2057
01:43:16.890 --> 01:43:18.730
<v Speaker 2>Glued to a screen with the podcasts.</v>

2058
01:43:18.810 --> 01:43:23.810
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was doing some work around my office </v>

2059
01:43:23.810 --> 01:43:24.420
<v Speaker 4>when I was listening to one of yours,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of one of your things on youtube and</v>

2060
01:43:24.421 --> 01:43:29.421
<v Speaker 4>I found that it was just as interesting </v>
<v Speaker 4>if I was doing some other things around </v>

2061
01:43:29.421 --> 01:43:30.470
<v Speaker 4>my office.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a very good passive,</v>

2062
01:43:30.471 --> 01:43:33.000
<v Speaker 4>like podcasts themselves are very good </v>
<v Speaker 4>passive form of income.</v>

2063
01:43:33.300 --> 01:43:35.070
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely entertainment that makes them</v>

2064
01:43:35.071 --> 01:43:38.850
<v Speaker 2>different than reading because reading </v>
<v Speaker 2>is faster if you're a good reader,</v>

2065
01:43:38.851 --> 01:43:40.920
<v Speaker 2>but you can't do anything else while </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're doing it.</v>

2066
01:43:41.090 --> 01:43:46.090
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are much more naturally attuned </v>

2067
01:43:46.090 --> 01:43:48.411
<v Speaker 2>to listening than they are to read it </v>
<v Speaker 2>because we've only been reading really </v>

2068
01:43:48.411 --> 01:43:52.280
<v Speaker 2>human beings have only been reading </v>
<v Speaker 2>roughly speaking in any large numbers </v>

2069
01:43:52.280 --> 01:43:52.430
<v Speaker 2>for hundred years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2070
01:43:52.460 --> 01:43:55.520
<v Speaker 2>It's a blink of the eye.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas we'd been listening for a very,</v>

2071
01:43:55.521 --> 01:44:00.521
<v Speaker 2>very long period of time and all this </v>
<v Speaker 2>new technology like puts us right back.</v>

2072
01:44:01.250 --> 01:44:03.830
<v Speaker 2>It puts us back into tribal mode </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically,</v>

2073
01:44:03.831 --> 01:44:07.250
<v Speaker 2>except with this incredible </v>
<v Speaker 2>technological enhancement.</v>

2074
01:44:07.490 --> 01:44:12.490
<v Speaker 2>It wouldn't be difficult at all to </v>
<v Speaker 2>extract the audio from any of these </v>

2075
01:44:12.490 --> 01:44:14.780
<v Speaker 2>youtube videos and just start putting it</v>
<v Speaker 2>online as a podcast and again,</v>

2076
01:44:14.781 --> 01:44:19.781
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people could listen to it when they're </v>

2077
01:44:19.781 --> 01:44:19.781
<v Speaker 2>in traffic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they can't look at it.</v>

2078
01:44:19.781 --> 01:44:21.190
<v Speaker 2>Anything on planes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm on the bus or wherever you are,</v>

2079
01:44:21.260 --> 01:44:26.260
<v Speaker 2>where you can just sit down and you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can close your eyes and you don't </v>

2080
01:44:26.260 --> 01:44:27.950
<v Speaker 2>have to be paying attention to it </v>
<v Speaker 2>visually.</v>

2081
01:44:28.100 --> 01:44:28.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2082
01:44:28.431 --> 01:44:30.230
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about four or five months ago,</v>

2083
01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:36.000
<v Speaker 2>I emailed the university,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the University of Toronto because they </v>

2084
01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:37.730
<v Speaker 2>have a kind of a massive online course </v>
<v Speaker 2>branch,</v>

2085
01:44:37.731 --> 01:44:40.370
<v Speaker 2>which they're toying with and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2086
01:44:40.371 --> 01:44:42.740
<v Speaker 2>I've got a million people who've watched</v>
<v Speaker 2>my videos,</v>

2087
01:44:42.741 --> 01:44:44.420
<v Speaker 2>like maybe you guys should give me a </v>
<v Speaker 2>hand.</v>

2088
01:44:44.810 --> 01:44:49.810
<v Speaker 2>We should do something about this </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I got a million people who are </v>

2089
01:44:49.810 --> 01:44:50.570
<v Speaker 2>watching these videos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like that's,</v>

2090
01:44:50.600 --> 01:44:53.060
<v Speaker 2>that's a significant number of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's worth attending to,</v>

2091
01:44:53.061 --> 01:44:57.140
<v Speaker 2>but perhaps I contacted the wrong people</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I never did get a response,</v>

2092
01:44:57.560 --> 01:45:02.560
<v Speaker 2>but it's something I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>While I'm doing it actively right now </v>

2093
01:45:02.560 --> 01:45:03.620
<v Speaker 2>and I think the quality of my videos has</v>
<v Speaker 2>improved substantially in the last month</v>

2094
01:45:04.070 --> 01:45:05.690
<v Speaker 2>and I really liked doing the video </v>
<v Speaker 2>editing.</v>

2095
01:45:05.690 --> 01:45:10.690
<v Speaker 2>Although it's very painstaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's definitely the universities </v>

2096
01:45:10.690 --> 01:45:15.670
<v Speaker 2>better be careful because they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>dumping their content online as fast as </v>

2097
01:45:15.670 --> 01:45:18.701
<v Speaker 2>they can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to make themselves </v>

2098
01:45:18.701 --> 01:45:18.701
<v Speaker 2>completely superfluous and some smart </v>
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>

2099
01:45:18.701 --> 01:45:23.350
<v Speaker 2>I've been thinking about this for 20 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years is going to take over the </v>

2100
01:45:23.350 --> 01:45:25.751
<v Speaker 2>accreditation end because you know all </v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd have to do is set up a series of </v>

2101
01:45:26.540 --> 01:45:31.490
<v Speaker 2>well designed examinations online and </v>
<v Speaker 2>only let a minority of people pass.</v>

2102
01:45:31.640 --> 01:45:34.280
<v Speaker 2>You have instant accreditation </v>
<v Speaker 2>credibility.</v>

2103
01:45:34.520 --> 01:45:39.520
<v Speaker 2>It's like here's an entire three years </v>
<v Speaker 2>worth of psychology courses.</v>

2104
01:45:40.220 --> 01:45:42.300
<v Speaker 2>Here's the exams.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You take them.</v>

2105
01:45:42.530 --> 01:45:45.980
<v Speaker 2>Only 15 percent of the people pass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why only 15 percent.</v>

2106
01:45:45.981 --> 01:45:49.670
<v Speaker 2>Why would you limit the number because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it makes the accreditation valuable,</v>

2107
01:45:50.150 --> 01:45:55.150
<v Speaker 2>but you would limit the number based on </v>
<v Speaker 2>what if you had a much larger group than</v>

2108
01:45:55.221 --> 01:45:59.770
<v Speaker 2>15 percent that were effectively </v>
<v Speaker 2>absorbing the information that you did?</v>

2109
01:45:59.810 --> 01:46:00.620
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fair enough.</v>

2110
01:46:00.620 --> 01:46:02.370
<v Speaker 2>You'd have to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd have to toy with a.</v>

2111
01:46:02.540 --> 01:46:04.940
<v Speaker 2>you'd have to toy with the accreditation</v>
<v Speaker 2>mechanisms,</v>

2112
01:46:05.270 --> 01:46:10.270
<v Speaker 2>but I mean part of part of the utility </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the accreditation is that it's </v>

2113
01:46:10.270 --> 01:46:14.710
<v Speaker 2>inequality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If everyone gets accredited then the </v>

2114
01:46:14.710 --> 01:46:17.951
<v Speaker 2>accreditation is worth noting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just make it difficult because </v>

2115
01:46:17.951 --> 01:46:17.951
<v Speaker 2>that's what you do is make a difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2116
01:46:17.951 --> 01:46:19.220
<v Speaker 2>but I mean instead of limiting </v>
<v Speaker 2>difficulty.</v>

2117
01:46:19.840 --> 01:46:24.840
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you wouldn't necessarily be limiting </v>

2118
01:46:24.840 --> 01:46:24.840
<v Speaker 2>the number.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You would just make it so difficult that</v>

2119
01:46:24.840 --> 01:46:25.890
<v Speaker 2>the number would be limited,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost match.</v>

2120
01:46:25.900 --> 01:46:26.510
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2121
01:46:26.511 --> 01:46:28.610
<v Speaker 2>I think I'd probably make it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd probably live.</v>

2122
01:46:28.640 --> 01:46:29.930
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's exactly right.</v>

2123
01:46:30.680 --> 01:46:33.680
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't limit the number of times </v>
<v Speaker 2>people could take the exams.</v>

2124
01:46:35.720 --> 01:46:39.290
<v Speaker 2>That's a great idea as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So as long as you hit threshold,</v>

2125
01:46:39.620 --> 01:46:41.540
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's what happens often.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say with,</v>

2126
01:46:41.570 --> 01:46:46.570
<v Speaker 2>with uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you're trying to trying to pass </v>

2127
01:46:46.570 --> 01:46:46.910
<v Speaker 2>the bar or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get to take it a number of times,</v>

2128
01:46:46.911 --> 01:46:48.920
<v Speaker 2>but you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to hit threshold.</v>

2129
01:46:49.110 --> 01:46:50.310
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thaddeus Russell,</v>

2130
01:46:50.310 --> 01:46:52.440
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's a history professor at Occidental,</v>

2131
01:46:52.650 --> 01:46:53.660
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2132
01:46:53.850 --> 01:46:58.850
<v Speaker 1>he's doing that very same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He talked about it here that he's </v>

2133
01:46:58.850 --> 01:47:01.790
<v Speaker 1>building right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an online university and he is planning </v>

2134
01:47:02.221 --> 01:47:07.221
<v Speaker 1>on giving out degrees in history through</v>
<v Speaker 1>his online university because he's been </v>

2135
01:47:07.221 --> 01:47:11.061
<v Speaker 1>teaching at universities for a long time</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he has a huge problem also with the </v>

2136
01:47:11.521 --> 01:47:15.200
<v Speaker 1>politically correct movement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was speaking out against a,</v>

2137
01:47:15.210 --> 01:47:18.960
<v Speaker 1>this really crazy story where these two </v>
<v Speaker 1>kids,</v>

2138
01:47:19.120 --> 01:47:23.790
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>adults got intoxicated and had sex.</v>

2139
01:47:24.150 --> 01:47:27.210
<v Speaker 1>And because they were both intoxicated </v>
<v Speaker 1>for some reason,</v>

2140
01:47:27.211 --> 01:47:32.211
<v Speaker 1>the boy was described as the attacker </v>
<v Speaker 1>and was a,</v>

2141
01:47:34.020 --> 01:47:38.340
<v Speaker 1>he was being accused of sexual assault </v>
<v Speaker 1>and even though it was consensual,</v>

2142
01:47:38.341 --> 01:47:40.140
<v Speaker 1>completely consensual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though they were both,</v>

2143
01:47:40.380 --> 01:47:42.720
<v Speaker 1>not only did she send him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she sent him texts saying,</v>

2144
01:47:42.721 --> 01:47:44.250
<v Speaker 1>do you have condoms?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come on over,</v>

2145
01:47:44.251 --> 01:47:46.590
<v Speaker 1>we're going to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he,</v>

2146
01:47:46.620 --> 01:47:50.190
<v Speaker 1>because they were intoxicated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was the one that was the rapist,</v>

2147
01:47:50.640 --> 01:47:51.420
<v Speaker 1>which is insane.</v>

2148
01:47:51.420 --> 01:47:53.650
<v Speaker 1>It's sexist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's 100 percent sexist though,</v>

2149
01:47:53.760 --> 01:47:55.400
<v Speaker 1>that that kid is suing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2150
01:47:55.401 --> 01:47:57.330
<v Speaker 1>and that ace Russell came on here and </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussed it,</v>

2151
01:47:57.331 --> 01:48:02.331
<v Speaker 1>but that politically correct ideology </v>
<v Speaker 1>where it's,</v>

2152
01:48:03.270 --> 01:48:06.930
<v Speaker 1>it's essentially it's prejudice against </v>
<v Speaker 1>men in that particular theory.</v>

2153
01:48:06.970 --> 01:48:09.420
<v Speaker 1>The idea that he's stepping outside of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the university.</v>

2154
01:48:09.460 --> 01:48:14.460
<v Speaker 1>I slowly moved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means God gets sod is doing that </v>

2155
01:48:14.460 --> 01:48:14.470
<v Speaker 1>exactly it to yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

2156
01:48:14.490 --> 01:48:17.820
<v Speaker 1>he gets 100,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>people watching is v each video.</v>

2157
01:48:17.850 --> 01:48:19.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's been out here a few times.</v>

2158
01:48:19.440 --> 01:48:21.210
<v Speaker 1>I love that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

2159
01:48:21.211 --> 01:48:26.211
<v Speaker 1>he's another one who like yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has stuck his neck out and spoke out </v>

2160
01:48:26.211 --> 01:48:30.501
<v Speaker 1>about what he thinks is this </v>
<v Speaker 1>preposterous movement towards denying </v>

2161
01:48:30.501 --> 01:48:34.881
<v Speaker 1>facts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>denying reality and forming these </v>

2162
01:48:34.881 --> 01:48:35.830
<v Speaker 1>narratives that are based on their </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideologies and,</v>

2163
01:48:36.050 --> 01:48:41.050
<v Speaker 1>and sticking within this box and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>seeking to find people that agree with </v>

2164
01:48:41.050 --> 01:48:43.500
<v Speaker 1>it and then reinforcing these ideas in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this echo chamber.</v>

2165
01:48:43.500 --> 01:48:48.500
<v Speaker 1>And it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's for someone who's outside of it </v>

2166
01:48:48.500 --> 01:48:51.921
<v Speaker 1>like myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a fascinating thing to watch for </v>

2167
01:48:51.921 --> 01:48:51.921
<v Speaker 1>someone who's inside of it like </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself,</v>

2168
01:48:51.921 --> 01:48:53.040
<v Speaker 1>it must be maddening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2169
01:48:53.041 --> 01:48:58.041
<v Speaker 1>we've tried to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've tried other online interventions </v>

2170
01:48:58.041 --> 01:48:58.041
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I have these youtube videos up,</v>

2171
01:48:58.041 --> 01:49:02.961
<v Speaker 1>but we also designed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I work with some corporations a while </v>

2172
01:49:02.961 --> 01:49:07.041
<v Speaker 1>back because I've done some consulting </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I had designed tests to help people </v>

2173
01:49:07.041 --> 01:49:09.180
<v Speaker 1>hire better employees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I still do.</v>

2174
01:49:09.390 --> 01:49:11.330
<v Speaker 1>And in fact I worked with his company up</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

2175
01:49:11.400 --> 01:49:16.400
<v Speaker 1>in California called the founder </v>
<v Speaker 1>institute and it's the world's largest </v>

2176
01:49:16.400 --> 01:49:17.010
<v Speaker 1>stage early technology company </v>
<v Speaker 1>incubator.</v>

2177
01:49:17.011 --> 01:49:22.011
<v Speaker 1>It's created 2,500</v>
<v Speaker 1>companies in the last four years and we </v>

2178
01:49:22.011 --> 01:49:25.551
<v Speaker 1>test now in 135 cities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when I was marketing these tests to </v>

2179
01:49:26.191 --> 01:49:31.191
<v Speaker 1>companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they kept asking me what could be done </v>

2180
01:49:31.191 --> 01:49:31.320
<v Speaker 1>about their poorer performing employees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I said,</v>

2181
01:49:31.321 --> 01:49:33.900
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know because it's not that easy</v>

2182
01:49:33.901 --> 01:49:36.390
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have someone who's problematic,</v>

2183
01:49:36.391 --> 01:49:41.391
<v Speaker 1>who's troubled,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not that easy for a manager to </v>

2184
01:49:41.391 --> 01:49:42.240
<v Speaker 1>figure out how to straighten them out </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they just don't have the time.</v>

2185
01:49:42.420 --> 01:49:44.420
<v Speaker 1>They don't have the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't have the manpower,</v>

2186
01:49:44.440 --> 01:49:46.290
<v Speaker 1>they don't have the training usually to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do that.</v>

2187
01:49:46.860 --> 01:49:48.460
<v Speaker 1>But I designed this set of programs</v>

2188
01:49:48.460 --> 01:49:51.340
<v Speaker 3>called the self authoring suite,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and one of them,</v>

2189
01:49:51.400 --> 01:49:55.210
<v Speaker 3>the future authoring program helps </v>
<v Speaker 3>people write out a plan for their life.</v>

2190
01:49:55.211 --> 01:50:00.211
<v Speaker 3>So it helps them to ask you some </v>
<v Speaker 3>questions about six dimensions of your </v>

2191
01:50:00.211 --> 01:50:00.211
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2192
01:50:00.211 --> 01:50:01.180
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your health,</v>

2193
01:50:01.450 --> 01:50:03.700
<v Speaker 3>mental and physical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your use of drugs and alcohol,</v>

2194
01:50:04.030 --> 01:50:07.600
<v Speaker 3>your wishes three to five years down the</v>
<v Speaker 3>road for intimate relationships,</v>

2195
01:50:07.601 --> 01:50:08.830
<v Speaker 3>for family,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for career,</v>

2196
01:50:08.831 --> 01:50:11.140
<v Speaker 3>for education and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It asks you,</v>

2197
01:50:11.560 --> 01:50:14.200
<v Speaker 3>what could your life be like three to </v>
<v Speaker 3>five years down the road?</v>

2198
01:50:14.440 --> 01:50:19.440
<v Speaker 3>If you set it up for you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you were someone you were taking </v>

2199
01:50:19.440 --> 01:50:19.720
<v Speaker 3>care of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it asks you those six questions,</v>

2200
01:50:20.500 --> 01:50:25.500
<v Speaker 3>then it asks you to write for 15 minutes</v>
<v Speaker 3>about about your vision for your life.</v>

2201
01:50:25.900 --> 01:50:28.210
<v Speaker 3>You get to have what you want and what </v>
<v Speaker 3>would be good for you,</v>

2202
01:50:28.480 --> 01:50:33.480
<v Speaker 3>what would that be?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then it asks you to write for 15 </v>

2203
01:50:33.480 --> 01:50:35.050
<v Speaker 3>minutes about what your life would be </v>
<v Speaker 3>like three to five years down the road.</v>

2204
01:50:35.050 --> 01:50:37.110
<v Speaker 3>If you let your bad habits and you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2205
01:50:37.150 --> 01:50:39.760
<v Speaker 3>idiocies in your foolishness is in your </v>
<v Speaker 3>weaknesses.</v>

2206
01:50:39.790 --> 01:50:44.790
<v Speaker 3>Take the upper hand in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Auger you into the ground because </v>

2207
01:50:44.790 --> 01:50:47.071
<v Speaker 3>everyone knows about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so it's like you get to design a </v>

2208
01:50:47.071 --> 01:50:49.870
<v Speaker 3>little heaven to strive for and little </v>
<v Speaker 3>hell to avoid and then you write for.</v>

2209
01:50:50.320 --> 01:50:52.810
<v Speaker 3>Then you basically turn that into an </v>
<v Speaker 3>implementable plan.</v>

2210
01:50:52.811 --> 01:50:56.560
<v Speaker 3>That's the second part of the program.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've used that with about 5,005</v>

2211
01:50:56.561 --> 01:50:59.710
<v Speaker 3>to 7,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>university students now mostly in Europe</v>

2212
01:50:59.711 --> 01:51:04.711
<v Speaker 3>at the Rotterdam School of management.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we've raised their grade point </v>

2213
01:51:04.711 --> 01:51:08.521
<v Speaker 3>average of their kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Twenty five percent drop their dropout </v>

2214
01:51:08.521 --> 01:51:11.311
<v Speaker 3>rate the same and it's had a walloping </v>
<v Speaker 3>effect on men and on non Western ethnic </v>

2215
01:51:11.651 --> 01:51:16.651
<v Speaker 3>minorities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's moved the Non Western ethnic </v>

2216
01:51:16.651 --> 01:51:19.381
<v Speaker 3>minority student population performance </v>
<v Speaker 3>at Rotterdam,</v>

2217
01:51:19.601 --> 01:51:22.090
<v Speaker 3>School of Management from 70 percent </v>
<v Speaker 3>below the,</v>

2218
01:51:22.240 --> 01:51:26.210
<v Speaker 3>the average to above the female Dutch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2219
01:51:26.350 --> 01:51:28.960
<v Speaker 3>natives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the other,</v>

2220
01:51:29.020 --> 01:51:34.020
<v Speaker 3>the reason I'm telling you this in part </v>
<v Speaker 3>from the fact that it's a very good </v>

2221
01:51:34.020 --> 01:51:34.020
<v Speaker 3>program,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and um,</v>

2222
01:51:34.020 --> 01:51:38.790
<v Speaker 3>we did it at Mohawk college in Canada a </v>
<v Speaker 3>year ago and we dropped their dropout </v>

2223
01:51:38.790 --> 01:51:43.111
<v Speaker 3>rate in the first semester,</v>
<v Speaker 3>50 percent and that especially again </v>

2224
01:51:43.111 --> 01:51:44.270
<v Speaker 3>worked well for men because men are at </v>
<v Speaker 3>more risk of dropping out now and,</v>

2225
01:51:44.271 --> 01:51:49.271
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and especially for men who didn't have </v>

2226
01:51:49.271 --> 01:51:49.271
<v Speaker 3>good grades in high school.</v>

2227
01:51:49.271 --> 01:51:52.620
<v Speaker 3>So not only is there the possibility for</v>
<v Speaker 3>the net to provide tremendous </v>

2228
01:51:53.441 --> 01:51:57.040
<v Speaker 3>dissemination of intellectual material,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's also the possibility for the</v>

2229
01:51:57.041 --> 01:52:02.041
<v Speaker 3>net to provide dissemination of </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychological interventions that have </v>

2230
01:52:02.290 --> 01:52:07.290
<v Speaker 3>major impacts on people's mental health </v>
<v Speaker 3>and productivity at almost at </v>

2231
01:52:07.290 --> 01:52:09.670
<v Speaker 3>extraordinarily low cost.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's really been fun too.</v>

2232
01:52:10.570 --> 01:52:14.290
<v Speaker 3>So I think providing some that sort of a</v>
<v Speaker 3>structure and a framework,</v>

2233
01:52:14.291 --> 01:52:18.670
<v Speaker 3>giving people the tools just inform of </v>
<v Speaker 3>asking them questions.</v>

2234
01:52:18.671 --> 01:52:21.400
<v Speaker 3>What would you like to do is describe </v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

2235
01:52:21.670 --> 01:52:26.670
<v Speaker 3>what is your view and when you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you sort of allow them to help </v>

2236
01:52:26.670 --> 01:52:28.510
<v Speaker 3>themselves outline what they would like </v>
<v Speaker 3>to accomplish,</v>

2237
01:52:28.511 --> 01:52:31.660
<v Speaker 3>which most people don't do well in our </v>
<v Speaker 3>education system,</v>

2238
01:52:32.050 --> 01:52:37.050
<v Speaker 3>our education system was designed in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Chicago in the late 18 hundreds to </v>

2239
01:52:37.050 --> 01:52:41.161
<v Speaker 3>produce factory workers because it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>set up when when rural people were </v>

2240
01:52:41.261 --> 01:52:43.720
<v Speaker 3>migrating to the cities on mass because </v>
<v Speaker 3>their kids,</v>

2241
01:52:43.721 --> 01:52:48.721
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're likely to get factory jobs and </v>

2242
01:52:48.721 --> 01:52:48.721
<v Speaker 3>second of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you were working in factory,</v>

2243
01:52:48.721 --> 01:52:52.601
<v Speaker 3>your kids needed to be taken care of and</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the purpose of the schools was to </v>

2244
01:52:52.601 --> 01:52:54.900
<v Speaker 3>train factory workers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is why everyone's lined up enrolls</v>

2245
01:52:55.110 --> 01:52:56.840
<v Speaker 3>rose and why there are bells.</v>

2246
01:52:56.840 --> 01:53:01.840
<v Speaker 3>It's a factory model.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The problem with that is that now </v>

2247
01:53:01.840 --> 01:53:02.660
<v Speaker 3>people's careers basically have to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>self determined,</v>

2248
01:53:02.661 --> 01:53:07.661
<v Speaker 3>but that's never.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's never part of the education </v>

2249
01:53:07.661 --> 01:53:10.091
<v Speaker 3>system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Part of the reason I developed these </v>

2250
01:53:10.091 --> 01:53:12.041
<v Speaker 3>programs was because I realized this is </v>
<v Speaker 3>the same course where I'm teaching </v>

2251
01:53:12.041 --> 01:53:14.090
<v Speaker 3>students that if they would have been in</v>
<v Speaker 3>Germany in the 19 thirties,</v>

2252
01:53:14.091 --> 01:53:19.091
<v Speaker 3>they would have be Nazis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to get them to design their </v>

2253
01:53:19.091 --> 01:53:22.811
<v Speaker 3>lives and it's way better to have </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone articulate their own plan.</v>

2254
01:53:24.380 --> 01:53:29.380
<v Speaker 3>You actually neurologically rewire </v>
<v Speaker 3>people by having them formulate their </v>

2255
01:53:29.380 --> 01:53:33.551
<v Speaker 3>own thoughts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is why you know your school </v>

2256
01:53:33.551 --> 01:53:33.551
<v Speaker 3>teachers used to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>put it in your own words.</v>

2257
01:53:33.551 --> 01:53:35.750
<v Speaker 3>It's actually very good advice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If they would explain what that means.</v>

2258
01:53:35.780 --> 01:53:40.780
<v Speaker 3>It's like if you have to conjure up the </v>
<v Speaker 3>thoughts and you have to articulate </v>

2259
01:53:40.780 --> 01:53:43.700
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then they change you and so well,</v>

2260
01:53:43.701 --> 01:53:47.440
<v Speaker 3>and so this program has had the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2261
01:53:47.600 --> 01:53:52.600
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the effects have been absolutely </v>

2262
01:53:52.600 --> 01:53:52.670
<v Speaker 3>overwhelming for us as researchers </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's very,</v>

2263
01:53:52.671 --> 01:53:57.671
<v Speaker 3>very difficult to produce an </v>
<v Speaker 3>intervention that actually has a </v>

2264
01:53:57.671 --> 01:53:58.760
<v Speaker 3>positive effect on people you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you hope it does,</v>

2265
01:53:58.761 --> 01:54:00.460
<v Speaker 3>but generally when you test it out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

2266
01:54:00.910 --> 01:54:02.690
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't do what you thought it did.</v>

2267
01:54:02.690 --> 01:54:04.520
<v Speaker 3>Or sometimes it even has the reverse </v>
<v Speaker 3>effect.</v>

2268
01:54:04.730 --> 01:54:05.840
<v Speaker 3>That sounds fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

2269
01:54:05.841 --> 01:54:07.880
<v Speaker 3>how do people have had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can someone,</v>

2270
01:54:07.940 --> 01:54:11.870
<v Speaker 3>a regular person have access to this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's called self authoring.</v>

2271
01:54:12.080 --> 01:54:14.000
<v Speaker 3>So that's e l,</v>
<v Speaker 3>f authoring,</v>

2272
01:54:14.001 --> 01:54:15.230
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like writing a book,</v>

2273
01:54:15.231 --> 01:54:19.970
<v Speaker 3>self authoring Dotcom and the programs I</v>
<v Speaker 3>gave away the future authoring program.</v>

2274
01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.300
<v Speaker 3>I think it might still be free.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2275
01:54:22.550 --> 01:54:23.540
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2276
01:54:23.541 --> 01:54:27.530
<v Speaker 3>it is until the end of November I did a </v>
<v Speaker 3>video called message to millennials were</v>

2277
01:54:27.950 --> 01:54:30.770
<v Speaker 3>because one of the things Jonathan Heit </v>
<v Speaker 3>said about,</v>

2278
01:54:30.830 --> 01:54:33.440
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he called Karl Marx,</v>

2279
01:54:33.441 --> 01:54:37.700
<v Speaker 3>the patron saint of the social justice </v>
<v Speaker 3>warriors and John Stuart Mill,</v>

2280
01:54:37.760 --> 01:54:41.210
<v Speaker 3>that patron saint of people say who </v>
<v Speaker 3>stood for objective truth and freedom of</v>

2281
01:54:41.211 --> 01:54:43.490
<v Speaker 3>expression.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I thought that was really smart.</v>

2282
01:54:43.491 --> 01:54:48.491
<v Speaker 3>He said Brown university is number one </v>
<v Speaker 3>for social justice warrior universities </v>

2283
01:54:48.491 --> 01:54:52.841
<v Speaker 3>in Chicago for Truth Universities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But one of the things that marks has </v>

2284
01:54:53.091 --> 01:54:58.091
<v Speaker 3>over John Stuart mill is that mark's is </v>
<v Speaker 3>a social revolutionary and young people </v>

2285
01:54:58.091 --> 01:54:59.570
<v Speaker 3>like to think about ways to change the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

2286
01:54:59.630 --> 01:55:04.630
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's actually a positive part of </v>

2287
01:55:04.630 --> 01:55:06.371
<v Speaker 3>their development.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a stage that the developmental </v>

2288
01:55:06.371 --> 01:55:08.981
<v Speaker 3>psychologist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sean Piaget called the messianic stage </v>

2289
01:55:08.981 --> 01:55:08.981
<v Speaker 3>and he associated that with late </v>
<v Speaker 3>adolescents.</v>

2290
01:55:08.990 --> 01:55:11.450
<v Speaker 3>So like while young people want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>change the world,</v>

2291
01:55:11.540 --> 01:55:16.540
<v Speaker 3>the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that that's been harnessed into </v>

2292
01:55:16.540 --> 01:55:18.080
<v Speaker 3>attempts to change other people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that isn't what you should do if you</v>

2293
01:55:18.081 --> 01:55:19.970
<v Speaker 3>want to change the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should change yourself.</v>

2294
01:55:19.971 --> 01:55:21.950
<v Speaker 3>And I don't mean that in some cliched </v>
<v Speaker 3>sense.</v>

2295
01:55:21.951 --> 01:55:26.951
<v Speaker 3>I mean it in the sense that Aleksandr </v>
<v Speaker 3>Solzhenitsyn said when he analyzed the </v>

2296
01:55:26.951 --> 01:55:27.110
<v Speaker 3>Soviet Union,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>

2297
01:55:27.590 --> 01:55:32.590
<v Speaker 3>don't be thinking that the line that </v>
<v Speaker 3>divides good from evil runs down </v>

2298
01:55:32.590 --> 01:55:33.730
<v Speaker 3>political spectrum or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or,</v>

2299
01:55:33.790 --> 01:55:38.790
<v Speaker 3>or countries or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It runs down right down the middle of </v>

2300
01:55:38.790 --> 01:55:42.641
<v Speaker 3>your soul.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you want to sort out the world </v>

2301
01:55:42.641 --> 01:55:42.641
<v Speaker 3>and what you do is you sort yourself </v>
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>

2302
01:55:42.800 --> 01:55:44.460
<v Speaker 3>It's a serious business,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2303
01:55:44.520 --> 01:55:47.520
<v Speaker 3>They say it's more difficult to rule </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself than to rule a city.</v>

2304
01:55:47.790 --> 01:55:52.790
<v Speaker 3>And that's the truth because you're a </v>
<v Speaker 3>complicated and there are horrible </v>

2305
01:55:52.790 --> 01:55:53.720
<v Speaker 3>monsters inside of you that need to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>tamed and to,</v>

2306
01:55:53.950 --> 01:55:58.740
<v Speaker 3>and to be brought and to be brought into</v>
<v Speaker 3>alignment and submission so that you can</v>

2307
01:55:58.741 --> 01:56:01.610
<v Speaker 3>be a powerful and useful person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

2308
01:56:02.820 --> 01:56:07.820
<v Speaker 3>I gave away the future authoring program</v>
<v Speaker 3>as part of this video I made suggesting </v>

2309
01:56:07.820 --> 01:56:12.291
<v Speaker 3>to millennials that instead of rushing </v>
<v Speaker 3>out there to change the world by </v>

2310
01:56:12.291 --> 01:56:15.471
<v Speaker 3>changing other bad people that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>should look inward and sort themselves </v>

2311
01:56:15.471 --> 01:56:19.671
<v Speaker 3>out properly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think we've given away about four </v>

2312
01:56:19.671 --> 01:56:22.731
<v Speaker 3>or 5,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>of those programs so far now free till </v>

2313
01:56:22.731 --> 01:56:23.400
<v Speaker 3>the end of November.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then what happens with it?</v>

2314
01:56:23.540 --> 01:56:28.540
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well the self or the future authoring </v>

2315
01:56:28.540 --> 01:56:28.540
<v Speaker 3>program is regularly $14,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ninety five cents.</v>

2316
01:56:28.540 --> 01:56:30.780
<v Speaker 3>And the whole self authoring suite which</v>
<v Speaker 3>involves,</v>

2317
01:56:31.080 --> 01:56:33.270
<v Speaker 3>it's a program that helps you write an </v>
<v Speaker 3>autobiography.</v>

2318
01:56:33.360 --> 01:56:36.480
<v Speaker 3>So it helps you sort out things about </v>
<v Speaker 3>your past that are still burdening you.</v>

2319
01:56:36.660 --> 01:56:40.530
<v Speaker 3>You can tell a if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you have a memory that's more than 18</v>

2320
01:56:40.531 --> 01:56:45.531
<v Speaker 3>months old approximately,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and when you pull that memory up to </v>

2321
01:56:45.531 --> 01:56:47.130
<v Speaker 3>mind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you still have an emotional reaction,</v>

2322
01:56:47.340 --> 01:56:51.330
<v Speaker 3>that means you haven't fully articulated</v>
<v Speaker 3>the memory,</v>

2323
01:56:51.450 --> 01:56:54.150
<v Speaker 3>you haven't analyzed it causally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you haven't,</v>

2324
01:56:54.300 --> 01:56:59.300
<v Speaker 3>you haven't freed yourself from its </v>
<v Speaker 3>grasp and you're carrying it like a </v>

2325
01:56:59.300 --> 01:57:02.991
<v Speaker 3>weight and your brain responds to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the more have more weight you're </v>

2326
01:57:02.991 --> 01:57:07.590
<v Speaker 3>carrying like that more baggage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's say the more of the stress Hormone</v>

2327
01:57:07.590 --> 01:57:10.290
<v Speaker 3>Cortisol your brain produces and </v>
<v Speaker 3>cortisol makes you old.</v>

2328
01:57:10.680 --> 01:57:14.460
<v Speaker 3>Some of this work has been done by James</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pennebaker at the University of Texas at</v>

2329
01:57:14.461 --> 01:57:19.461
<v Speaker 3>Austin because he.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He started to pioneer these sorts of </v>

2330
01:57:19.461 --> 01:57:22.311
<v Speaker 3>writing programs and he found that if </v>
<v Speaker 3>people wrote about uncertain things </v>

2331
01:57:22.311 --> 01:57:26.960
<v Speaker 3>past,</v>
<v Speaker 3>present or future so they could be </v>

2332
01:57:26.960 --> 01:57:26.960
<v Speaker 3>traumatic things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they could be uncertain,</v>

2333
01:57:26.960 --> 01:57:28.560
<v Speaker 3>things that their physical health </v>
<v Speaker 3>improved and he.</v>

2334
01:57:28.590 --> 01:57:33.150
<v Speaker 3>He did a lot of detailed research trying</v>
<v Speaker 3>to figure out why that was and basically</v>

2335
01:57:33.151 --> 01:57:38.151
<v Speaker 3>came down to the explanation that it was</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like an uncertainty reduction </v>

2336
01:57:38.161 --> 01:57:43.161
<v Speaker 3>mechanism at work because your brain is </v>
<v Speaker 3>always figuring out how well situated </v>

2337
01:57:43.161 --> 01:57:45.060
<v Speaker 3>are you in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How much do you not know compared to how</v>

2338
01:57:45.061 --> 01:57:50.061
<v Speaker 3>much have you mastered?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you can tell that you've mastered </v>

2339
01:57:50.061 --> 01:57:52.090
<v Speaker 3>things because when you go somewhere and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you act things turn out the way you want</v>

2340
01:57:52.091 --> 01:57:54.360
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's an indication of mastery and your</v>

2341
01:57:54.361 --> 01:57:59.361
<v Speaker 3>brain is sort of keeping track across </v>
<v Speaker 3>your whole life of how many places </v>

2342
01:57:59.361 --> 01:58:00.840
<v Speaker 3>you've been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where things haven't worked out compared</v>

2343
01:58:00.841 --> 01:58:03.330
<v Speaker 3>to how many places you have been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where they have worked out,</v>

2344
01:58:03.750 --> 01:58:07.140
<v Speaker 3>and if all those places in your past </v>
<v Speaker 3>where things haven't worked out,</v>

2345
01:58:07.141 --> 01:58:12.141
<v Speaker 3>you need to map and master and that that</v>
<v Speaker 3>decreases the existential load on you,</v>

2346
01:58:14.521 --> 01:58:17.280
<v Speaker 3>but that actually decreases your </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychophysiological load.</v>

2347
01:58:17.340 --> 01:58:19.800
<v Speaker 3>It makes you healthier.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It makes you less stress,</v>

2348
01:58:20.160 --> 01:58:24.120
<v Speaker 3>and so we've put all that together in </v>
<v Speaker 3>this self authoring suite to help people</v>

2349
01:58:24.121 --> 01:58:26.670
<v Speaker 3>write about their past,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to sort it out in a.</v>

2350
01:58:26.670 --> 01:58:29.240
<v Speaker 3>In a detailed autobiography.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It asks you questions about your past.</v>

2351
01:58:29.241 --> 01:58:34.241
<v Speaker 3>It says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>divide your life up into six epochs and </v>

2352
01:58:34.241 --> 01:58:35.220
<v Speaker 3>then divide each of those.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That might be,</v>

2353
01:58:35.221 --> 01:58:35.790
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2354
01:58:35.850 --> 01:58:40.850
<v Speaker 3>birth to kindergarten and then maybe </v>
<v Speaker 3>elementary school and then maybe junior </v>

2355
01:58:40.850 --> 01:58:41.010
<v Speaker 3>high school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>however you want to do it,</v>

2356
01:58:41.290 --> 01:58:46.290
<v Speaker 3>and then to write about the emotionally </v>
<v Speaker 3>significant events in each of those </v>

2357
01:58:46.290 --> 01:58:50.880
<v Speaker 3>epochs and then to describe their </v>
<v Speaker 3>effects on you and then to analyze how </v>

2358
01:58:51.101 --> 01:58:53.650
<v Speaker 3>you did in those situations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What you might have done differently.</v>

2359
01:58:53.651 --> 01:58:57.070
<v Speaker 3>What you might do differently in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>future to straighten out your past,</v>

2360
01:58:57.400 --> 01:59:02.400
<v Speaker 3>and I've done that with my students in </v>
<v Speaker 3>my maps of meaning class for about the </v>

2361
01:59:02.400 --> 01:59:02.920
<v Speaker 3>last 10 years and some people have </v>
<v Speaker 3>written 15,000</v>

2362
01:59:02.921 --> 01:59:03.430
<v Speaker 3>words.</v>

2363
01:59:03.730 --> 01:59:06.460
<v Speaker 3>It's not that uncommon for students to </v>
<v Speaker 3>write 15,000</v>

2364
01:59:06.461 --> 01:59:08.500
<v Speaker 3>words and their autobiography.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2365
01:59:08.560 --> 01:59:13.560
<v Speaker 3>So that's such great advice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's such great advice about </v>

2366
01:59:13.560 --> 01:59:15.010
<v Speaker 3>reconciling with your past because so </v>
<v Speaker 3>many people just carry it around.</v>

2367
01:59:15.011 --> 01:59:15.400
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2368
01:59:15.401 --> 01:59:17.590
<v Speaker 3>if you're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're thinking about your past,</v>

2369
01:59:18.400 --> 01:59:22.450
<v Speaker 3>what it means is you haven't analyzed </v>
<v Speaker 3>the causal chains because you might say,</v>

2370
01:59:22.451 --> 01:59:24.310
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why do you remember your past?</v>

2371
01:59:24.820 --> 01:59:25.570
<v Speaker 3>While you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2372
01:59:25.571 --> 01:59:27.540
<v Speaker 3>it's in order to have an objective,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2373
01:59:27.820 --> 01:59:32.820
<v Speaker 3>record of the past.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like it has nothing to do with </v>

2374
01:59:32.820 --> 01:59:32.820
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's only one reason you remember the</v>

2375
01:59:32.820 --> 01:59:34.900
<v Speaker 3>past and that's to be prepared for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>future.</v>

2376
01:59:35.530 --> 01:59:40.530
<v Speaker 3>That's why you remember the past.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so what you're supposed to do is </v>

2377
01:59:40.530 --> 01:59:43.890
<v Speaker 3>take the past and extract out from it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wisdom and wisdom is the ability to </v>

2378
01:59:44.141 --> 01:59:48.460
<v Speaker 3>avoid stumbling blindly into ditches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so you think,</v>

2379
01:59:48.461 --> 01:59:50.410
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's a time in my past.</v>

2380
01:59:50.410 --> 01:59:55.410
<v Speaker 3>I stumbled blindly into this horrible </v>
<v Speaker 3>ditch and terrible things happened to </v>

2381
01:59:55.410 --> 01:59:55.410
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2382
01:59:55.410 --> 01:59:56.440
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you need to take that apart.</v>

2383
01:59:56.441 --> 02:00:01.441
<v Speaker 3>You need to figure out how was it that </v>
<v Speaker 3>that events conspired with your </v>

2384
02:00:01.451 --> 02:00:06.451
<v Speaker 3>participation voluntarily or </v>
<v Speaker 3>involuntarily so that that terrible </v>

2385
02:00:06.451 --> 02:00:11.400
<v Speaker 3>consequences merged.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You need to know why that happened and </v>

2386
02:00:11.400 --> 02:00:12.250
<v Speaker 3>how you could react differently in that </v>
<v Speaker 3>situation,</v>

2387
02:00:12.460 --> 02:00:15.700
<v Speaker 3>and as soon as you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your brain will leave it alone.</v>

2388
02:00:15.910 --> 02:00:20.910
<v Speaker 3>You won't obsess you about it anymore </v>
<v Speaker 3>because the anxiety producing parts of </v>

2389
02:00:20.910 --> 02:00:24.751
<v Speaker 3>your brain are basically trying to tell </v>
<v Speaker 3>you where there are obstacles in your </v>

2390
02:00:24.751 --> 02:00:24.751
<v Speaker 3>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2391
02:00:24.751 --> 02:00:26.020
<v Speaker 3>look out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't go there.</v>

2392
02:00:26.050 --> 02:00:27.400
<v Speaker 3>Don't go there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2393
02:00:27.401 --> 02:00:28.990
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't go there.</v>

2394
02:00:28.991 --> 02:00:30.610
<v Speaker 3>There's fire.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2395
02:00:30.970 --> 02:00:33.340
<v Speaker 3>maybe you could master the fire,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2396
02:00:33.790 --> 02:00:38.790
<v Speaker 3>Then you're a wielder of fire.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not just a victim and lots of </v>

2397
02:00:38.790 --> 02:00:42.301
<v Speaker 3>situations are dangerous or not </v>
<v Speaker 3>dangerous depending on your level of </v>

2398
02:00:42.301 --> 02:00:42.520
<v Speaker 3>mastery,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2399
02:00:42.850 --> 02:00:47.850
<v Speaker 3>Life is like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so a negative emotion that's </v>

2400
02:00:47.850 --> 02:00:51.451
<v Speaker 3>associated with a memory is something </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's crying out for mastery and </v>

2401
02:00:51.451 --> 02:00:55.210
<v Speaker 3>writing can really help with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you're reorganizing your brain.</v>

2402
02:00:55.211 --> 02:00:57.610
<v Speaker 3>When you write autobiographically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

2403
02:00:57.611 --> 02:01:02.611
<v Speaker 3>you're basically the emotions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Imagine emotion memories can be stored </v>

2404
02:01:02.611 --> 02:01:07.561
<v Speaker 3>at different levels of your brain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some sort of primordial reptilian image </v>

2405
02:01:07.561 --> 02:01:12.340
<v Speaker 3>laden areas that are very emotional up </v>
<v Speaker 3>to finally articulated plans for your </v>

2406
02:01:13.961 --> 02:01:18.961
<v Speaker 3>future life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Will you want to take everything that's </v>

2407
02:01:18.961 --> 02:01:22.230
<v Speaker 3>negative and emotional and transform </v>
<v Speaker 3>that into a fully articulated vision for</v>

2408
02:01:23.021 --> 02:01:25.570
<v Speaker 3>your future and that frees you of your </v>
<v Speaker 3>past.</v>

2409
02:01:26.050 --> 02:01:27.640
<v Speaker 3>You shouldn't be thinking about your </v>
<v Speaker 3>past.</v>

2410
02:01:28.190 --> 02:01:31.150
<v Speaker 3>I mean maybe if you're 80 and you know </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going over a well spent life,</v>

2411
02:01:31.151 --> 02:01:33.250
<v Speaker 3>that's a whole different thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you're a 30,</v>

2412
02:01:33.251 --> 02:01:36.550
<v Speaker 3>35 or 20 and most of the time you </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking about your past,</v>

2413
02:01:36.551 --> 02:01:40.760
<v Speaker 3>it's like it's like your soul is trapped</v>
<v Speaker 3>back there and you need to.</v>

2414
02:01:40.790 --> 02:01:45.790
<v Speaker 3>You need to free it through </v>
<v Speaker 3>investigation and the metaphysical </v>

2415
02:01:45.790 --> 02:01:46.910
<v Speaker 3>language is appropriate because that is </v>
<v Speaker 3>in a sense what you're doing.</v>

2416
02:01:46.911 --> 02:01:51.911
<v Speaker 3>You're trapped in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like you've got to break free of </v>

2417
02:01:51.911 --> 02:01:52.370
<v Speaker 3>that so you can use all your resources </v>
<v Speaker 3>to move ahead into the future.</v>

2418
02:01:53.120 --> 02:01:56.030
<v Speaker 3>Anyways in these programs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the future authoring program,</v>

2419
02:01:56.031 --> 02:01:58.290
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has had walloping effects on people.</v>

2420
02:01:58.291 --> 02:01:59.870
<v Speaker 3>It's dones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fantastic advice to me.</v>

2421
02:01:59.871 --> 02:02:03.050
<v Speaker 3>It's just so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so logical and it sounds so great.</v>

2422
02:02:03.650 --> 02:02:08.650
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's one of the gigantic </v>

2423
02:02:08.650 --> 02:02:08.900
<v Speaker 3>problems that a lot of people have with </v>
<v Speaker 3>education,</v>

2424
02:02:08.901 --> 02:02:11.360
<v Speaker 3>that you're learning facts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're learning information,</v>

2425
02:02:11.600 --> 02:02:14.300
<v Speaker 3>but you're not learning how to use your </v>
<v Speaker 3>own mind.</v>

2426
02:02:14.301 --> 02:02:17.090
<v Speaker 3>Now here's something that's really </v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting about that.</v>

2427
02:02:17.660 --> 02:02:20.330
<v Speaker 3>So I spent a lot of time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a scientist,</v>

2428
02:02:20.331 --> 02:02:22.610
<v Speaker 3>but I'm also.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say I'm also a religious person.</v>

2429
02:02:22.611 --> 02:02:26.330
<v Speaker 3>I'm a deeply religious person and how do</v>
<v Speaker 3>you reconcile those?</v>

2430
02:02:26.370 --> 02:02:27.080
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2431
02:02:27.081 --> 02:02:28.880
<v Speaker 3>that's that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I spent literally,</v>

2432
02:02:28.881 --> 02:02:33.881
<v Speaker 3>I've spent 40 years thinking about that </v>
<v Speaker 3>and for 20 of those years I did almost </v>

2433
02:02:33.881 --> 02:02:38.771
<v Speaker 3>nothing but think about that all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>time and I realized something partly </v>

2434
02:02:38.771 --> 02:02:40.970
<v Speaker 3>from Reading Carl young and what I </v>
<v Speaker 3>realized was that</v>

2435
02:02:43.150 --> 02:02:47.680
<v Speaker 3>even the fundamentalists have have the </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrong idea about religious truth.</v>

2436
02:02:48.640 --> 02:02:52.720
<v Speaker 3>Religious truth is not scientific truth </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the stories in genesis,</v>

2437
02:02:52.721 --> 02:02:55.660
<v Speaker 3>which are very old stories,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe tens of thousands of years old.</v>

2438
02:02:56.170 --> 02:03:01.170
<v Speaker 3>They're obviously not scientific </v>
<v Speaker 3>theories because the people who wrote </v>

2439
02:03:01.170 --> 02:03:03.871
<v Speaker 3>the board scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we didn't have science until about 500 </v>

2440
02:03:03.871 --> 02:03:06.541
<v Speaker 3>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the idea that the stories in genesis </v>

2441
02:03:06.541 --> 02:03:09.241
<v Speaker 3>or scientific theories is just false on </v>
<v Speaker 3>every possible front.</v>

2442
02:03:10.270 --> 02:03:11.140
<v Speaker 3>So then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2443
02:03:11.141 --> 02:03:13.030
<v Speaker 3>there's no other truth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but scientific truth.</v>

2444
02:03:13.031 --> 02:03:13.510
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2445
02:03:13.570 --> 02:03:18.570
<v Speaker 3>wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not true because what scientific </v>

2446
02:03:18.570 --> 02:03:22.831
<v Speaker 3>truth tells you is what things are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but genuine religious truth tells you </v>

2447
02:03:25.610 --> 02:03:28.850
<v Speaker 3>how you should act and those things are </v>
<v Speaker 3>not the same.</v>

2448
02:03:29.420 --> 02:03:33.260
<v Speaker 3>And so a great story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a great novel which is a quasi religious</v>

2449
02:03:33.261 --> 02:03:38.261
<v Speaker 3>construction because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like a distillation of ordinary </v>

2450
02:03:38.261 --> 02:03:39.230
<v Speaker 3>life into its most important elements.</v>

2451
02:03:40.670 --> 02:03:43.790
<v Speaker 3>That's a map about how you should </v>
<v Speaker 3>comport yourself in the world.</v>

2452
02:03:44.060 --> 02:03:46.100
<v Speaker 3>And you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well what do you mean by should?</v>

2453
02:03:46.440 --> 02:03:48.650
<v Speaker 3>And because that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the question,</v>

2454
02:03:48.651 --> 02:03:51.440
<v Speaker 3>the moral relativist Sask.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's an answer to that too.</v>

2455
02:03:51.441 --> 02:03:56.441
<v Speaker 3>As far as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I got this partly from reading John </v>

2456
02:03:56.441 --> 02:03:59.320
<v Speaker 3>Piaget.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So imagine that here's how you should </v>

2457
02:03:59.320 --> 02:04:01.121
<v Speaker 3>act.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You should act so that things are good </v>

2458
02:04:01.121 --> 02:04:05.531
<v Speaker 3>for you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they would be for someone you're </v>

2459
02:04:05.531 --> 02:04:07.181
<v Speaker 3>taking care of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they have to be good for you in a </v>

2460
02:04:07.181 --> 02:04:10.211
<v Speaker 3>way that's also good for your family.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they have to be good for you and </v>

2461
02:04:10.211 --> 02:04:13.880
<v Speaker 3>your family in a way that's also good </v>
<v Speaker 3>for society and maybe even also good for</v>

2462
02:04:13.881 --> 02:04:18.881
<v Speaker 3>the broader environment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you could manage that so it's </v>

2463
02:04:18.881 --> 02:04:21.731
<v Speaker 3>balanced at all those levels and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>they that has to be good for you and </v>

2464
02:04:22.401 --> 02:04:27.401
<v Speaker 3>your family and society and the world </v>
<v Speaker 3>right now and next week and next month </v>

2465
02:04:27.710 --> 02:04:32.710
<v Speaker 3>and a year from now and 10 years from </v>
<v Speaker 3>now and so it's this harmonious </v>

2466
02:04:32.710 --> 02:04:36.750
<v Speaker 3>balancing of multiple layers of being </v>
<v Speaker 3>simultaneously and and that's a.</v>

2467
02:04:36.960 --> 02:04:39.240
<v Speaker 3>that's a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a Darwinian reality.</v>

2468
02:04:39.241 --> 02:04:44.241
<v Speaker 3>I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your brain is actually attuned to tell </v>

2469
02:04:44.241 --> 02:04:46.040
<v Speaker 3>you when you're doing that and the way </v>
<v Speaker 3>it tells you is that it chew,</v>

2470
02:04:46.140 --> 02:04:48.720
<v Speaker 3>it reveals that what you're doing is </v>
<v Speaker 3>meaningful.</v>

2471
02:04:49.680 --> 02:04:53.880
<v Speaker 3>That's the sign that you and your </v>
<v Speaker 3>nervous system is adapted to do this.</v>

2472
02:04:53.881 --> 02:04:58.881
<v Speaker 3>It's adapted to exist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say on the on the edge between </v>

2473
02:04:58.881 --> 02:05:00.870
<v Speaker 3>order and chaos and chaos is where </v>
<v Speaker 3>things are so complex.</v>

2474
02:05:00.871 --> 02:05:05.871
<v Speaker 3>You can handle it in order is where </v>
<v Speaker 3>things are so rigid that it's too </v>

2475
02:05:05.871 --> 02:05:07.140
<v Speaker 3>restrictive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In between that there's a place,</v>

2476
02:05:07.290 --> 02:05:12.290
<v Speaker 3>a place that's meaningful where you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>partly stabilized and partly curious and</v>

2477
02:05:12.301 --> 02:05:17.301
<v Speaker 3>you're operating in a manner that </v>
<v Speaker 3>increases your scope of of knowledge,</v>

2478
02:05:17.730 --> 02:05:22.730
<v Speaker 3>so you're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're inquiring and growing and at the </v>

2479
02:05:22.730 --> 02:05:24.900
<v Speaker 3>same time you're stabilizing and </v>
<v Speaker 3>renewing you,</v>

2480
02:05:24.930 --> 02:05:26.310
<v Speaker 3>your family,</v>
<v Speaker 3>society,</v>

2481
02:05:26.520 --> 02:05:27.750
<v Speaker 3>nature.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

2482
02:05:27.840 --> 02:05:29.940
<v Speaker 3>next week,</v>
<v Speaker 3>next month and next year,</v>

2483
02:05:30.180 --> 02:05:32.160
<v Speaker 3>and when you have an intimation of </v>
<v Speaker 3>meaning,</v>

2484
02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:36.660
<v Speaker 3>then you know you're there and I can </v>
<v Speaker 3>give you an existential demonstration of</v>

2485
02:05:36.661 --> 02:05:36.840
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

2486
02:05:36.840 --> 02:05:40.380
<v Speaker 3>So imagine that each of these levels of </v>
<v Speaker 3>existence,</v>

2487
02:05:40.381 --> 02:05:44.040
<v Speaker 3>the way I just laid them out or like </v>
<v Speaker 3>patterns or patterns within patterns,</v>

2488
02:05:44.041 --> 02:05:45.390
<v Speaker 3>within patterns,</v>
<v Speaker 3>within patterns,</v>

2489
02:05:45.391 --> 02:05:47.130
<v Speaker 3>and there's a way of making all that </v>
<v Speaker 3>harmonious.</v>

2490
02:05:47.430 --> 02:05:51.030
<v Speaker 3>That's what music models.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why music is so meaningful.</v>

2491
02:05:51.540 --> 02:05:56.540
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you take a beautiful orchestral </v>

2492
02:05:56.540 --> 02:05:59.001
<v Speaker 3>composition and all the instruments are </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing different things at different </v>

2493
02:05:59.001 --> 02:06:02.361
<v Speaker 3>levels,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they all flow together harmoniously </v>

2494
02:06:02.361 --> 02:06:04.521
<v Speaker 3>and you're right in the middle of that </v>
<v Speaker 3>as a listener and it fills you with a </v>

2495
02:06:04.521 --> 02:06:05.010
<v Speaker 3>sense of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like a sense of religious or</v>

2496
02:06:05.040 --> 02:06:07.420
<v Speaker 3>even if you're a punk rock nihilist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2497
02:06:08.550 --> 02:06:13.550
<v Speaker 3>and the reason for that is because the </v>
<v Speaker 3>music is modeling the manner of being </v>

2498
02:06:13.550 --> 02:06:17.691
<v Speaker 3>that's harmonious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the proper way to exist and </v>

2499
02:06:17.691 --> 02:06:20.451
<v Speaker 3>religious writings in the deepest sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so those are archetipal writings are are</v>

2500
02:06:21.190 --> 02:06:26.190
<v Speaker 3>our guidelines to that mode of being so </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not true like scientific truth </v>

2501
02:06:27.151 --> 02:06:28.770
<v Speaker 3>is true there.</v>

2502
02:06:29.040 --> 02:06:33.030
<v Speaker 3>I think of them as hyper there </v>
<v Speaker 3>hypertrophy or meditate true.</v>

2503
02:06:33.570 --> 02:06:38.570
<v Speaker 3>It's like we take the most true things </v>
<v Speaker 3>about your life and then we take the </v>

2504
02:06:38.570 --> 02:06:42.231
<v Speaker 3>most true things about 10 other people's</v>
<v Speaker 3>lives and we amalgamate them into a </v>

2505
02:06:42.231 --> 02:06:45.120
<v Speaker 3>single figure and that would be like to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That would be like a literary hero.</v>

2506
02:06:45.890 --> 02:06:50.890
<v Speaker 3>Then we take a thousand literary heroes </v>
<v Speaker 3>and we extract out from each of them </v>

2507
02:06:50.890 --> 02:06:54.510
<v Speaker 3>what makes the most heroic person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a religious daddy.</v>

2508
02:06:55.740 --> 02:07:00.740
<v Speaker 3>That's what Christ is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a metta hero and that sits at the </v>

2509
02:07:01.201 --> 02:07:06.201
<v Speaker 3>bottom of western civilization and his </v>
<v Speaker 3>architectural mode of being his true </v>

2510
02:07:09.420 --> 02:07:14.420
<v Speaker 3>speech.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the fundamental idea of western </v>

2511
02:07:14.420 --> 02:07:14.420
<v Speaker 3>civilization and it's right</v>

2512
02:07:16.680 --> 02:07:21.680
<v Speaker 4>now when you say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you talk about this harmonious </v>

2513
02:07:21.690 --> 02:07:25.810
<v Speaker 4>frequency that's achieved,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>

2514
02:07:25.860 --> 02:07:30.860
<v Speaker 4>How do you reconcile all the stories </v>
<v Speaker 4>that were like say in the Old Testament </v>

2515
02:07:30.860 --> 02:07:32.550
<v Speaker 4>that were extremely violent or with </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're ridiculous.</v>

2516
02:07:32.551 --> 02:07:33.430
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2517
02:07:33.510 --> 02:07:36.490
<v Speaker 4>who was the guy that they made fun of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these children made fun of?</v>

2518
02:07:36.491 --> 02:07:41.491
<v Speaker 4>I'm so God sent a bear to kill the </v>
<v Speaker 4>children because they made fun of him </v>

2519
02:07:41.491 --> 02:07:45.661
<v Speaker 4>for being bald.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or there's a bunch of stories and </v>

2520
02:07:45.661 --> 02:07:48.870
<v Speaker 4>ridiculous tails in the Bible that </v>
<v Speaker 4>obviously have the hand of man on them.</v>

2521
02:07:49.120 --> 02:07:54.120
<v Speaker 4>How do you separate those from the </v>
<v Speaker 4>beautiful concepts that are outlined in </v>

2522
02:07:55.251 --> 02:08:00.251
<v Speaker 4>religion?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you treat everyone as if they are </v>

2523
02:08:00.251 --> 02:08:00.450
<v Speaker 4>your brother,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2524
02:08:00.960 --> 02:08:02.800
<v Speaker 4>love and let love</v>

2525
02:08:03.010 --> 02:08:08.010
<v Speaker 2>and that was very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very difficult because it's all in the </v>

2526
02:08:08.010 --> 02:08:11.041
<v Speaker 2>Old Testament.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's say the Old Testament was </v>

2527
02:08:11.041 --> 02:08:11.041
<v Speaker 2>obviously written by people who were </v>
<v Speaker 2>deeply tribal.</v>

2528
02:08:11.280 --> 02:08:13.480
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're also deeply tribal and some of the</v>

2529
02:08:13.481 --> 02:08:17.110
<v Speaker 2>problems that those people were trying </v>
<v Speaker 2>to face trying to sort out was,</v>

2530
02:08:17.111 --> 02:08:20.560
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you organize yourself within your</v>

2531
02:08:20.561 --> 02:08:25.561
<v Speaker 2>own tribe?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Justly and mercifully and at the same </v>

2532
02:08:25.561 --> 02:08:29.761
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>defend yourself against the barbarians </v>

2533
02:08:29.761 --> 02:08:29.761
<v Speaker 2>who constitute other drives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2534
02:08:29.761 --> 02:08:34.590
<v Speaker 2>that was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the problem that humanity was </v>

2535
02:08:34.590 --> 02:08:34.590
<v Speaker 2>trying to solve when it was a mega </v>
<v Speaker 2>meeting.</v>

2536
02:08:34.590 --> 02:08:37.210
<v Speaker 2>All of its tribes process that obviously</v>
<v Speaker 2>still hasn't,</v>

2537
02:08:37.450 --> 02:08:42.450
<v Speaker 2>hasn't finished,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and some of the ways that you protect </v>

2538
02:08:42.450 --> 02:08:47.131
<v Speaker 2>your own tribe rapidly become horrifying</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so many of the stories in the Old </v>

2539
02:08:47.131 --> 02:08:51.031
<v Speaker 2>Testament that have to do essentially </v>
<v Speaker 2>with tribal protection are immediately </v>

2540
02:08:51.031 --> 02:08:51.250
<v Speaker 2>horrifying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's also a.</v>

2541
02:08:51.580 --> 02:08:56.580
<v Speaker 2>there's a developmental pathway through </v>
<v Speaker 2>the combination of the old and New </v>

2542
02:08:56.580 --> 02:08:57.790
<v Speaker 2>Testament that that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that show,</v>

2543
02:08:57.791 --> 02:09:02.791
<v Speaker 2>I would say how that morality that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamentally tribal to begin with </v>

2544
02:09:03.010 --> 02:09:08.010
<v Speaker 2>transformed itself over thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 2>years into a morality that was what that</v>

2545
02:09:09.130 --> 02:09:14.130
<v Speaker 2>transcended tribal distinctions and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>part of the imposition of the new </v>

2546
02:09:14.561 --> 02:09:19.561
<v Speaker 2>testament onto the old testament was the</v>
<v Speaker 2>imposition of a morality that </v>

2547
02:09:19.561 --> 02:09:23.281
<v Speaker 2>transcended tribal morality onto a </v>
<v Speaker 2>morality that was fundamentally tribal </v>

2548
02:09:23.281 --> 02:09:23.530
<v Speaker 2>in origin.</v>

2549
02:09:24.310 --> 02:09:26.190
<v Speaker 2>But the new testament of course was</v>

2550
02:09:26.810 --> 02:09:29.720
<v Speaker 4>constructed by Constantine and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>series of bishops.</v>

2551
02:09:29.721 --> 02:09:31.150
<v Speaker 4>They took things out.</v>

2552
02:09:32.590 --> 02:09:34.030
<v Speaker 2>I mean how so?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2553
02:09:34.080 --> 02:09:36.380
<v Speaker 2>it's not much different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's a way of thinking about it,</v>

2554
02:09:36.800 --> 02:09:41.300
<v Speaker 2>so I have a friend who's a comic book </v>
<v Speaker 2>writer and I've talked to him a fair bit</v>

2555
02:09:41.301 --> 02:09:43.160
<v Speaker 2>about archetypes in comics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For example.</v>

2556
02:09:43.161 --> 02:09:48.161
<v Speaker 2>He was a student of mine at Harvard long</v>
<v Speaker 2>time ago and the Comic Book Universe is </v>

2557
02:09:48.161 --> 02:09:52.961
<v Speaker 2>a very interesting one because obviously</v>
<v Speaker 2>these fictional characters were thought </v>

2558
02:09:52.961 --> 02:09:56.861
<v Speaker 2>up by single people and then the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fictional characters were transformed </v>

2559
02:09:56.861 --> 02:10:00.560
<v Speaker 2>into stories and then the stories were </v>
<v Speaker 2>sent out into a broader community.</v>

2560
02:10:00.860 --> 02:10:05.860
<v Speaker 2>But then what started to happen was the </v>
<v Speaker 2>broader community started to stay in </v>

2561
02:10:05.860 --> 02:10:10.361
<v Speaker 2>contact with the people who are writing </v>
<v Speaker 2>the stories and so if you do something </v>

2562
02:10:10.361 --> 02:10:13.540
<v Speaker 2>like write Batman now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a bunch of things you can't do </v>

2563
02:10:13.540 --> 02:10:16.691
<v Speaker 2>with Batman because there's been a </v>
<v Speaker 2>collective decision made in the entire </v>

2564
02:10:16.691 --> 02:10:21.371
<v Speaker 2>community of multiple writers and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>entire community of multiple readers </v>

2565
02:10:21.440 --> 02:10:26.440
<v Speaker 2>that have decided that there's a core </v>
<v Speaker 2>story that has a certain structure in </v>

2566
02:10:26.440 --> 02:10:29.981
<v Speaker 2>certain elements.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so there's this collective process </v>

2567
02:10:29.981 --> 02:10:33.221
<v Speaker 2>of imagination that's gone into </v>
<v Speaker 2>constructing what you might describe as </v>

2568
02:10:33.221 --> 02:10:33.890
<v Speaker 2>a heroic Meta narrative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

2569
02:10:34.070 --> 02:10:39.070
<v Speaker 3>the reason I'm using that as an example </v>
<v Speaker 3>is because there isn't a lot of </v>

2570
02:10:39.070 --> 02:10:40.400
<v Speaker 3>difference,</v>
<v Speaker 3>perversely enough in the construction,</v>

2571
02:10:40.401 --> 02:10:44.570
<v Speaker 3>say of Comic Book Heroes and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>construction of religious deities,</v>

2572
02:10:44.660 --> 02:10:49.660
<v Speaker 3>and I'm not saying that religious </v>
<v Speaker 3>daddies or nothing but comic book </v>

2573
02:10:49.660 --> 02:10:52.811
<v Speaker 3>characters or maybe I'm elevating comic </v>
<v Speaker 3>book characters beyond the status that </v>

2574
02:10:52.811 --> 02:10:54.470
<v Speaker 3>they normally attained.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you think,</v>

2575
02:10:54.471 --> 02:10:56.000
<v Speaker 3>think about this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

2576
02:10:56.001 --> 02:11:01.001
<v Speaker 3>with regards to something like the </v>
<v Speaker 3>construction of the recent marvel </v>

2577
02:11:01.001 --> 02:11:03.851
<v Speaker 3>universe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean those avenger movies are among </v>

2578
02:11:03.851 --> 02:11:08.381
<v Speaker 3>the most expensive technological </v>
<v Speaker 3>artifacts that human beings have ever </v>

2579
02:11:08.381 --> 02:11:10.970
<v Speaker 3>made and they drive our computational </v>
<v Speaker 3>capacity to its absolute limit.</v>

2580
02:11:11.270 --> 02:11:16.270
<v Speaker 3>And the reason for that is because we're</v>
<v Speaker 3>using that fictional space to lay out an</v>

2581
02:11:16.340 --> 02:11:18.620
<v Speaker 3>archetypical and mythological view of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the universe.</v>

2582
02:11:18.621 --> 02:11:21.320
<v Speaker 3>It's a practice domain for modes of </v>
<v Speaker 3>being.</v>

2583
02:11:21.620 --> 02:11:25.870
<v Speaker 3>And I mean in the Marvel Universe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously Tony Stark Ironman is,</v>

2584
02:11:25.910 --> 02:11:27.770
<v Speaker 3>is technological man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2585
02:11:27.830 --> 02:11:32.830
<v Speaker 3>He's trying to develop a real </v>
<v Speaker 3>relationship with his partner pepper </v>

2586
02:11:32.830 --> 02:11:36.251
<v Speaker 3>potts whose own sort of independent </v>
<v Speaker 3>woman and he's attempting to use </v>

2587
02:11:36.251 --> 02:11:40.991
<v Speaker 3>technology to build himself up into </v>
<v Speaker 3>something that has the status of </v>

2588
02:11:40.991 --> 02:11:43.190
<v Speaker 3>approximately a god to transcend more </v>
<v Speaker 3>limitation.</v>

2589
02:11:43.190 --> 02:11:44.720
<v Speaker 3>And all of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2590
02:11:45.410 --> 02:11:47.720
<v Speaker 3>so there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a daddy like aspect,</v>

2591
02:11:47.900 --> 02:11:51.410
<v Speaker 3>the growth of a deity emerging there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then of course thor and Loki,</v>

2592
02:11:51.411 --> 02:11:55.390
<v Speaker 3>or they're not comic book ease at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Their actual daddy's there,</v>

2593
02:11:55.470 --> 02:11:57.680
<v Speaker 3>the hostile brothers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an archetypal,</v>

2594
02:11:58.160 --> 02:12:03.160
<v Speaker 3>it's an archetype will pair like Christ </v>
<v Speaker 3>and Satan or Batman and the joker or </v>

2595
02:12:03.160 --> 02:12:06.880
<v Speaker 3>superman and Lex luthor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's the good part of the </v>

2596
02:12:06.880 --> 02:12:07.430
<v Speaker 3>individual against the evil part of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>individual,</v>

2597
02:12:07.550 --> 02:12:10.220
<v Speaker 3>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's played out in these myths.</v>

2598
02:12:10.221 --> 02:12:15.221
<v Speaker 3>And so that collective process that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>described whereby an entire group of </v>

2599
02:12:15.591 --> 02:12:19.370
<v Speaker 3>people comes together to decide what the</v>
<v Speaker 3>central religious text is.</v>

2600
02:12:19.371 --> 02:12:21.590
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the one hand you can think of that as</v>

2601
02:12:22.040 --> 02:12:24.560
<v Speaker 3>the gerrymandering of a religious </v>
<v Speaker 3>process.</v>

2602
02:12:24.590 --> 02:12:29.590
<v Speaker 3>Maybe that's something that's only </v>
<v Speaker 3>devoted towards the acquisition of </v>

2603
02:12:29.590 --> 02:12:29.750
<v Speaker 3>power.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that would be a Marxist analysis.</v>

2604
02:12:30.200 --> 02:12:35.200
<v Speaker 3>But on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can think of it as the collective </v>

2605
02:12:35.200 --> 02:12:35.200
<v Speaker 3>imagination.</v>

2606
02:12:35.200 --> 02:12:37.680
<v Speaker 3>Attempting to build a dramatic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2607
02:12:38.390 --> 02:12:43.390
<v Speaker 3>to build,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to build a and exemplary drama that </v>

2608
02:12:43.390 --> 02:12:44.480
<v Speaker 3>everyone can act out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's,</v>

2609
02:12:44.510 --> 02:12:49.510
<v Speaker 3>it's enacting that exemplary drama that </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're actually able to interact in a </v>

2610
02:12:49.880 --> 02:12:54.880
<v Speaker 3>civilized and productive manner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like look at this discussion that we're </v>

2611
02:12:54.880 --> 02:12:55.100
<v Speaker 3>having to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the degree that it's working,</v>

2612
02:12:56.270 --> 02:13:01.270
<v Speaker 3>we're both trying to articulate our </v>
<v Speaker 3>notions of reality and I do that and you</v>

2613
02:13:03.231 --> 02:13:08.231
<v Speaker 3>listen and maybe you have some comments </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you do that and I listened and </v>

2614
02:13:08.231 --> 02:13:11.531
<v Speaker 3>maybe you have some comments,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but together we're building something </v>

2615
02:13:11.531 --> 02:13:12.020
<v Speaker 3>that's different from what we both came </v>
<v Speaker 3>in here with.</v>

2616
02:13:12.050 --> 02:13:14.480
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and in a sense what we're doing is we're</v>

2617
02:13:14.481 --> 02:13:19.481
<v Speaker 3>participating in the process of </v>
<v Speaker 3>articulating each other's spirits and I </v>

2618
02:13:19.481 --> 02:13:23.651
<v Speaker 3>mean that most technically like part of </v>
<v Speaker 3>your spirit is an amalgam of the </v>

2619
02:13:23.651 --> 02:13:25.400
<v Speaker 3>information that you've encountered.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of that is articulated,</v>

2620
02:13:25.730 --> 02:13:29.000
<v Speaker 3>articulated wisdom and so its sole </v>
<v Speaker 3>construction.</v>

2621
02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:34.000
<v Speaker 3>If you're having a good conversation and</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's also conversation that is </v>

2622
02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:34.560
<v Speaker 3>meaningful and you can tell that when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're having it,</v>

2623
02:13:34.950 --> 02:13:38.940
<v Speaker 3>it's that you're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're decomposing parts of yourself,</v>

2624
02:13:38.970 --> 02:13:43.970
<v Speaker 3>your false presuppositions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're letting them die and you're </v>

2625
02:13:43.970 --> 02:13:47.541
<v Speaker 3>letting something new be born as an </v>
<v Speaker 3>alternative and you're participating in </v>

2626
02:13:48.451 --> 02:13:50.820
<v Speaker 3>this process of death and rebirth </v>
<v Speaker 3>constantly.</v>

2627
02:13:50.821 --> 02:13:52.620
<v Speaker 3>When you're having a meaningful </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation,</v>

2628
02:13:52.920 --> 02:13:53.280
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2629
02:13:53.281 --> 02:13:54.110
<v Speaker 3>that was wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Honey,</v>

2630
02:13:54.120 --> 02:13:55.090
<v Speaker 3>let that die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2631
02:13:55.100 --> 02:13:57.960
<v Speaker 3>that's a little painful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was kind of attached to that concept,</v>

2632
02:13:57.961 --> 02:13:59.610
<v Speaker 3>but I'll let it go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let it burn off,</v>

2633
02:13:59.820 --> 02:14:04.820
<v Speaker 3>and a new part of you will emerge and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then another part dies and the new part </v>

2634
02:14:04.820 --> 02:14:06.540
<v Speaker 3>emerges,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's this process of eternal death</v>

2635
02:14:06.541 --> 02:14:10.290
<v Speaker 3>and rebirth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's part of to the general mythology of</v>

2636
02:14:10.291 --> 02:14:12.720
<v Speaker 3>redemption and you see that all the time</v>
<v Speaker 3>too,</v>

2637
02:14:12.721 --> 02:14:14.460
<v Speaker 3>and the Harry Potter series,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

2638
02:14:15.120 --> 02:14:16.830
<v Speaker 3>at the very end of the Harry Potter </v>
<v Speaker 3>series,</v>

2639
02:14:17.550 --> 02:14:22.550
<v Speaker 3>Potter undergoes a literal death and </v>
<v Speaker 3>rebirth and that's how he finally </v>

2640
02:14:22.550 --> 02:14:22.550
<v Speaker 3>defeats evil.</v>

2641
02:14:22.550 --> 02:14:24.090
<v Speaker 3>These stories are deeply built into </v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

2642
02:14:24.450 --> 02:14:29.450
<v Speaker 3>There's a reason that that jk rowling </v>
<v Speaker 3>became the richest person in England by </v>

2643
02:14:29.450 --> 02:14:33.530
<v Speaker 3>she's richer than the queen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She got rich by telling the story </v>

2644
02:14:33.530 --> 02:14:33.900
<v Speaker 3>properly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2645
02:14:33.901 --> 02:14:36.740
<v Speaker 3>and the second volume of Harry Potter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>

2646
02:14:36.780 --> 02:14:39.570
<v Speaker 3>when there's the basilisk underneath the</v>
<v Speaker 3>castle that turns you to stone.</v>

2647
02:14:39.571 --> 02:14:42.390
<v Speaker 3>When you look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's everything that people are afraid</v>

2648
02:14:42.391 --> 02:14:47.391
<v Speaker 3>of that freezes you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like a rabbit freezes when it sees a </v>

2649
02:14:47.391 --> 02:14:51.171
<v Speaker 3>wolf and the story and Harry Potter is </v>
<v Speaker 3>you go underneath the castle to where </v>

2650
02:14:51.171 --> 02:14:56.151
<v Speaker 3>the thing that fear frightens you the </v>
<v Speaker 3>most resides and you face it down and in</v>

2651
02:14:56.941 --> 02:14:58.410
<v Speaker 3>doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you free the virgin,</v>

2652
02:14:58.411 --> 02:14:59.340
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That St George,</v>

2653
02:14:59.341 --> 02:15:03.330
<v Speaker 3>he frees Virginia and the Harry Potter </v>
<v Speaker 3>Story and maybe you have died because of</v>

2654
02:15:03.331 --> 02:15:05.070
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because he gets bitten by that.</v>

2655
02:15:05.100 --> 02:15:08.490
<v Speaker 3>Baskets can just about dies and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the phoenix that saves them because</v>

2656
02:15:08.491 --> 02:15:10.530
<v Speaker 3>the Phoenix is the spirit of death and </v>
<v Speaker 3>rebirth.</v>

2657
02:15:11.520 --> 02:15:13.110
<v Speaker 3>These stories,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they come up everywhere.</v>

2658
02:15:13.290 --> 02:15:15.660
<v Speaker 3>There's no avoiding them and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they're true,</v>

2659
02:15:16.260 --> 02:15:17.910
<v Speaker 3>but they're not true like scientific </v>
<v Speaker 3>truths.</v>

2660
02:15:18.810 --> 02:15:20.880
<v Speaker 3>There are different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are behavioral truth,</v>

2661
02:15:20.881 --> 02:15:23.400
<v Speaker 3>if are a pragmatic truth or a dramatic </v>
<v Speaker 3>truth,</v>

2662
02:15:23.910 --> 02:15:27.420
<v Speaker 3>and part of the reason that our society </v>
<v Speaker 3>is so damn on stable now and part of the</v>

2663
02:15:27.421 --> 02:15:32.421
<v Speaker 3>reason all this weird chaos is emerging.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a consequence of niches </v>

2664
02:15:32.421 --> 02:15:34.290
<v Speaker 3>observation back from the late 18 </v>
<v Speaker 3>hundreds about the death of God.</v>

2665
02:15:34.590 --> 02:15:39.590
<v Speaker 3>We blew the metaphysical foundations out</v>
<v Speaker 3>from underneath our culture and the </v>

2666
02:15:39.590 --> 02:15:40.980
<v Speaker 3>whole thing is shaking and twisting and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's.</v>

2667
02:15:40.981 --> 02:15:43.980
<v Speaker 3>It's vacillating between the horrors of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the extreme,</v>

2668
02:15:43.981 --> 02:15:46.050
<v Speaker 3>right and the horrors of the extreme </v>
<v Speaker 3>left.</v>

2669
02:15:46.051 --> 02:15:48.720
<v Speaker 3>It's been doing that for 140 years and </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're in the throes of that.</v>

2670
02:15:48.721 --> 02:15:51.150
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we blew the metaphysical foundations out</v>

2671
02:15:51.151 --> 02:15:54.210
<v Speaker 3>from underneath her culture and we need </v>
<v Speaker 3>to get them back.</v>

2672
02:15:54.510 --> 02:15:59.510
<v Speaker 3>Part of the reason that people are so </v>
<v Speaker 3>obsessed by things like the avengers </v>

2673
02:15:59.510 --> 02:16:01.170
<v Speaker 3>movies and superheros and Harry Potter </v>
<v Speaker 3>and all of that is because,</v>

2674
02:16:01.830 --> 02:16:04.820
<v Speaker 3>and Star Trek and star wars is because </v>
<v Speaker 3>our,</v>

2675
02:16:04.821 --> 02:16:09.821
<v Speaker 3>our collective imagination is trying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>regroup at the level of drama and </v>

2676
02:16:10.561 --> 02:16:15.561
<v Speaker 3>reformulate our fundamental metaphysics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was reading this thing that was </v>

2677
02:16:15.561 --> 02:16:20.031
<v Speaker 3>talking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were equating crossfit and yoga to </v>

2678
02:16:20.031 --> 02:16:23.991
<v Speaker 3>religion and they were saying it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>essentially religion for people that </v>

2679
02:16:23.991 --> 02:16:26.710
<v Speaker 3>have abandoned traditional religions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that the idea is that we'll receiving</v>

2680
02:16:26.720 --> 02:16:30.560
<v Speaker 3>is camaraderie or and discipline</v>

2681
02:16:30.650 --> 02:16:35.650
<v Speaker 4>discipline and some sort of a shared </v>
<v Speaker 4>community experience.</v>

2682
02:16:36.230 --> 02:16:38.390
<v Speaker 4>So when you're talking about when you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>saying your religion,</v>

2683
02:16:38.391 --> 02:16:43.391
<v Speaker 4>you're not talking about a literal </v>
<v Speaker 4>translation like a guy actually came </v>

2684
02:16:43.391 --> 02:16:43.391
<v Speaker 4>back from the dead.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2685
02:16:43.391 --> 02:16:47.830
<v Speaker 4>you're talking about is the concepts and</v>
<v Speaker 4>the thoughts and the harmonious </v>

2686
02:16:48.590 --> 02:16:53.590
<v Speaker 4>frequency that is achieved when people </v>
<v Speaker 4>follow the tenets of that religion and </v>

2687
02:16:53.930 --> 02:16:58.930
<v Speaker 4>live by these laws.</v>
<v Speaker 4>As you were saying of stacking on these </v>

2688
02:16:58.930 --> 02:16:59.660
<v Speaker 4>ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is this good for you?</v>

2689
02:16:59.810 --> 02:17:04.810
<v Speaker 4>Is it good for the community?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it good for the community in five </v>

2690
02:17:04.810 --> 02:17:04.810
<v Speaker 4>years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in 10 years,</v>

2691
02:17:04.810 --> 02:17:08.860
<v Speaker 4>and in that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that that's what you're saying when </v>

2692
02:17:08.860 --> 02:17:08.860
<v Speaker 4>you're talking about,</v>

2693
02:17:08.860 --> 02:17:09.010
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're believing love,</v>

2694
02:17:09.080 --> 02:17:12.340
<v Speaker 2>relationship thing about that is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>like imagine that there's,</v>

2695
02:17:12.500 --> 02:17:16.150
<v Speaker 2>there's a pathological mode of being </v>
<v Speaker 2>that so terrible that when you enact it,</v>

2696
02:17:16.151 --> 02:17:21.151
<v Speaker 2>you just die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A good drug addiction will do that for </v>

2697
02:17:21.151 --> 02:17:21.151
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you had pursued that meth addiction,</v>

2698
02:17:21.151 --> 02:17:22.690
<v Speaker 2>pursue that for about 10 years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2699
02:17:22.880 --> 02:17:26.090
<v Speaker 2>and you'll descend to the lower levels </v>
<v Speaker 2>of hell and then you'll die.</v>

2700
02:17:26.510 --> 02:17:27.080
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2701
02:17:27.081 --> 02:17:28.850
<v Speaker 2>so then you might might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2702
02:17:28.851 --> 02:17:29.570
<v Speaker 2>what's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's,</v>

2703
02:17:29.600 --> 02:17:33.440
<v Speaker 2>what's at the opposite end of that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What would be the final manifestation of</v>

2704
02:17:33.770 --> 02:17:36.710
<v Speaker 2>a mode of life that was revivifying and </v>
<v Speaker 2>healthy?</v>

2705
02:17:36.860 --> 02:17:37.910
<v Speaker 2>How,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>

2706
02:17:38.030 --> 02:17:43.030
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how redemptive and rejuvenating would </v>

2707
02:17:43.030 --> 02:17:45.851
<v Speaker 2>that be?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I would say the answer to that is </v>

2708
02:17:45.851 --> 02:17:46.790
<v Speaker 2>that we don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have no idea and these ideas of death</v>

2709
02:17:46.791 --> 02:17:49.160
<v Speaker 2>and rebirth are definitely true on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>micro level,</v>

2710
02:17:49.400 --> 02:17:54.400
<v Speaker 2>like so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The developmental psychologist Piaget </v>

2711
02:17:54.400 --> 02:17:54.400
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

2712
02:17:54.400 --> 02:17:55.970
<v Speaker 2>that when you incorporated new </v>
<v Speaker 2>information,</v>

2713
02:17:56.300 --> 02:18:01.300
<v Speaker 2>however you did that learning or </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation that that new information </v>

2714
02:18:01.300 --> 02:18:05.231
<v Speaker 2>would exist in in contradiction to </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that you already presumed and </v>

2715
02:18:05.231 --> 02:18:09.221
<v Speaker 2>so that thing you presumed would have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>disintegrate and die and and then </v>

2716
02:18:09.221 --> 02:18:09.221
<v Speaker 2>something new will be born.</v>

2717
02:18:09.221 --> 02:18:11.030
<v Speaker 2>That can happen at different levels of </v>
<v Speaker 2>analysis,</v>

2718
02:18:11.031 --> 02:18:16.031
<v Speaker 2>so sometimes you learn something minor </v>
<v Speaker 2>and sometimes you're shook to your </v>

2719
02:18:16.031 --> 02:18:16.490
<v Speaker 2>bloody core,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2720
02:18:16.491 --> 02:18:19.730
<v Speaker 2>and and you undergo a descent into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>underworld fundamentally,</v>

2721
02:18:19.731 --> 02:18:24.731
<v Speaker 2>sometimes even a descent into hell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where you get genocidal and </v>

2722
02:18:24.731 --> 02:18:26.420
<v Speaker 2>resentful and then maybe you're lucky </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you pop up reborn.</v>

2723
02:18:26.750 --> 02:18:28.160
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those,</v>

2724
02:18:28.220 --> 02:18:33.220
<v Speaker 2>those exist as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as constant metaphysical truths that </v>

2725
02:18:33.220 --> 02:18:36.730
<v Speaker 2>that's how human beings transformed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't know the upper limits of that </v>

2726
02:18:36.730 --> 02:18:40.751
<v Speaker 2>transformation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have no idea what that might be </v>

2727
02:18:40.751 --> 02:18:40.751
<v Speaker 2>because I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

2728
02:18:40.751 --> 02:18:44.741
<v Speaker 2>how healthy you could be as if you were </v>
<v Speaker 2>as healthy as you could be if you </v>

2729
02:18:44.741 --> 02:18:45.790
<v Speaker 2>straightened yourself out completely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what,</v>

2730
02:18:45.800 --> 02:18:50.800
<v Speaker 2>what your.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What limits you could transcend and </v>

2731
02:18:50.800 --> 02:18:51.710
<v Speaker 2>neither does anybody else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we don't know the upper limits of the</v>

2732
02:18:51.711 --> 02:18:56.711
<v Speaker 2>truth of these religious stories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now we do know what happens if you let </v>

2733
02:18:56.711 --> 02:19:00.461
<v Speaker 2>go of them too badly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You end up with something like the </v>

2734
02:19:00.461 --> 02:19:03.170
<v Speaker 2>Soviet Union or Mao's China,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which were both based on.</v>

2735
02:19:03.950 --> 02:19:04.550
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2736
02:19:04.750 --> 02:19:06.020
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were atheist,</v>

2737
02:19:06.150 --> 02:19:07.220
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were secular.</v>

2738
02:19:07.221 --> 02:19:07.730
<v Speaker 2>They were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2739
02:19:07.750 --> 02:19:08.950
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they dispense.</v>

2740
02:19:09.090 --> 02:19:14.090
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for Marx it was religion was the opiate </v>

2741
02:19:14.090 --> 02:19:14.090
<v Speaker 2>of the masses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

2742
02:19:14.090 --> 02:19:14.090
<v Speaker 2>it's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand that,</v>

2743
02:19:14.120 --> 02:19:17.870
<v Speaker 2>I understand that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's another one of those situations</v>

2744
02:19:17.871 --> 02:19:20.810
<v Speaker 2>where it's like religion is the opiate </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the masses.</v>

2745
02:19:20.811 --> 02:19:25.811
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's also 50 other things and you </v>

2746
02:19:25.811 --> 02:19:26.540
<v Speaker 2>don't want to forget those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like really we know for example,</v>

2747
02:19:26.541 --> 02:19:28.280
<v Speaker 2>from studies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>religious</v>

2748
02:19:28.280 --> 02:19:33.280
<v Speaker 3>belief as a human universal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the reason for that in part is </v>

2749
02:19:33.280 --> 02:19:36.620
<v Speaker 3>because there is a distinction between </v>
<v Speaker 3>good and evil and there is a distinction</v>

2750
02:19:36.621 --> 02:19:41.621
<v Speaker 3>between good and bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Otherwise you wouldn't do anything like </v>

2751
02:19:41.621 --> 02:19:41.840
<v Speaker 3>you're always striving for the good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2752
02:19:41.841 --> 02:19:46.841
<v Speaker 3>unless you've taken a malevolent turn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a natural impulse in human beings </v>

2753
02:19:46.841 --> 02:19:49.670
<v Speaker 3>to make what is better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>While it means we have an.</v>

2754
02:19:49.940 --> 02:19:54.940
<v Speaker 3>We have a deeply inbuilt sense of what </v>
<v Speaker 3>constitutes better and we're all aware </v>

2755
02:19:54.940 --> 02:19:57.030
<v Speaker 3>of that harmonious state that's achieved</v>
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>

2756
02:19:57.370 --> 02:19:57.850
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2757
02:19:57.860 --> 02:19:59.450
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The thing that's interesting about it,</v>

2758
02:19:59.451 --> 02:20:02.690
<v Speaker 3>like one of the things that need your </v>
<v Speaker 3>thought was after he announced the death</v>

2759
02:20:02.691 --> 02:20:07.691
<v Speaker 3>of God was that people would be able to </v>
<v Speaker 3>create new values and Carl Jung took </v>

2760
02:20:07.691 --> 02:20:12.011
<v Speaker 3>issue with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was a student of niches and he </v>

2761
02:20:12.011 --> 02:20:12.011
<v Speaker 3>pointed out basically that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2762
02:20:12.011 --> 02:20:14.210
<v Speaker 3>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who says you can create your own values?</v>

2763
02:20:14.540 --> 02:20:17.300
<v Speaker 3>You can't even get yourself out of bed </v>
<v Speaker 3>to go exercise in the morning.</v>

2764
02:20:17.810 --> 02:20:22.810
<v Speaker 3>You're not under your own control.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe we could discover maybe we could </v>

2765
02:20:22.810 --> 02:20:27.221
<v Speaker 3>rediscover the values that we once held </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's the descent into the </v>

2766
02:20:27.221 --> 02:20:28.610
<v Speaker 3>underworld and the resurrection of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>father.</v>

2767
02:20:28.820 --> 02:20:30.620
<v Speaker 3>That's what happens in Pinocchio.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For example,</v>

2768
02:20:30.621 --> 02:20:35.621
<v Speaker 3>you know when Pinocchio goes down into </v>
<v Speaker 3>the depths to face monster and </v>

2769
02:20:35.621 --> 02:20:40.070
<v Speaker 3>revitalized his dead father,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a reason that movie was made in </v>

2770
02:20:40.070 --> 02:20:41.030
<v Speaker 3>the 19 thirties and why it was so </v>
<v Speaker 3>popular.</v>

2771
02:20:41.031 --> 02:20:43.970
<v Speaker 3>It's like you want to have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want to get rid of your damn strings</v>

2772
02:20:43.971 --> 02:20:47.330
<v Speaker 3>and stopped being an erotic jackass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what this story's about is you go</v>

2773
02:20:47.331 --> 02:20:52.331
<v Speaker 3>down to the bottom of the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You find the thing you're most afraid </v>

2774
02:20:52.331 --> 02:20:52.331
<v Speaker 3>of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You face it,</v>

2775
02:20:52.331 --> 02:20:56.590
<v Speaker 3>you rescue your dead father from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>depths and you rise back to the surface </v>

2776
02:20:56.751 --> 02:20:58.910
<v Speaker 3>with him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what our culture has to do.</v>

2777
02:20:59.930 --> 02:21:01.310
<v Speaker 3>That's what our culture has to do.</v>

2778
02:21:02.670 --> 02:21:07.670
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you say that your religious person </v>

2779
02:21:07.670 --> 02:21:09.891
<v Speaker 4>though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people automatically assume that you </v>

2780
02:21:09.891 --> 02:21:09.900
<v Speaker 4>know there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially in this country,</v>

2781
02:21:09.901 --> 02:21:12.030
<v Speaker 4>the religious right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a very,</v>

2782
02:21:12.031 --> 02:21:17.031
<v Speaker 4>a dogmatic and very simplistic view of </v>
<v Speaker 4>what God wants and the.</v>

2783
02:21:20.291 --> 02:21:21.000
<v Speaker 4>I mean it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

2784
02:21:21.001 --> 02:21:21.540
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

2785
02:21:21.541 --> 02:21:26.541
<v Speaker 4>it's lumped into no homosexuals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a certain restrictions on the behavior </v>

2786
02:21:26.911 --> 02:21:31.911
<v Speaker 4>of women.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That if you look at the Bible and the </v>

2787
02:21:31.911 --> 02:21:35.631
<v Speaker 4>Bible is obviously a reflection of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>people that lived at the time where it </v>

2788
02:21:35.631 --> 02:21:38.961
<v Speaker 4>was constructed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Although even trying to figure out when </v>

2789
02:21:38.961 --> 02:21:38.961
<v Speaker 4>that is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2790
02:21:38.961 --> 02:21:41.520
<v Speaker 4>an oral tradition for thousands of years</v>
<v Speaker 4>before it was ever written down,</v>

2791
02:21:41.730 --> 02:21:46.730
<v Speaker 4>written in ancient Hebrew,</v>
<v Speaker 4>translated to Latin and Greek and Roman </v>

2792
02:21:46.730 --> 02:21:46.920
<v Speaker 4>or and I'm English rather.</v>

2793
02:21:47.190 --> 02:21:52.190
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's always a tension in religions </v>

2794
02:21:52.190 --> 02:21:53.961
<v Speaker 3>between the dogmatic element in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>spiritual element and conservatives </v>

2795
02:21:53.961 --> 02:21:58.460
<v Speaker 3>technically speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tend to tend to Marshall themselves on </v>

2796
02:21:58.460 --> 02:22:02.601
<v Speaker 3>the sides of the more rule oriented and </v>
<v Speaker 3>dogmatic elements of the religion and </v>

2797
02:22:02.601 --> 02:22:06.231
<v Speaker 3>liberals roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tend to Marshall themselves more on the </v>

2798
02:22:06.231 --> 02:22:06.231
<v Speaker 3>spiritual side</v>

2799
02:22:06.231 --> 02:22:10.920
<v Speaker 4>and that's because of the distinction </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you were saying earlier about the </v>

2800
02:22:10.920 --> 02:22:10.920
<v Speaker 4>behavior patterns of people that</v>

2801
02:22:11.130 --> 02:22:13.410
<v Speaker 3>conservative conscientiousness versus </v>
<v Speaker 3>openness.</v>

2802
02:22:13.411 --> 02:22:18.411
<v Speaker 3>Roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I mean the dogmatic structures are </v>

2803
02:22:18.411 --> 02:22:21.531
<v Speaker 3>necessarily necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The dogma is necessary because it </v>

2804
02:22:21.531 --> 02:22:24.801
<v Speaker 3>conserves the structure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a spiritual aspect is necessary </v>

2805
02:22:24.801 --> 02:22:29.121
<v Speaker 3>because it updates the and there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>always this tension and there's a </v>

2806
02:22:29.121 --> 02:22:32.241
<v Speaker 3>tension in people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like you have to believe things </v>

2807
02:22:32.241 --> 02:22:32.241
<v Speaker 3>are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You couldn't exist.</v>

2808
02:22:32.241 --> 02:22:36.171
<v Speaker 3>You couldn't act.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to hold onto the dogmatic </v>

2809
02:22:36.171 --> 02:22:39.141
<v Speaker 3>structure of your belief,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you have to be open for its update </v>

2810
02:22:39.141 --> 02:22:42.651
<v Speaker 3>on a continual basis and that's well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's basically what consciousness is </v>

2811
02:22:42.651 --> 02:22:46.071
<v Speaker 3>for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Seriously speaking consciousness is the </v>

2812
02:22:46.071 --> 02:22:49.941
<v Speaker 3>thing that attends to the unknown into </v>
<v Speaker 3>the anomaly and integrates it with the </v>

2813
02:22:50.551 --> 02:22:53.280
<v Speaker 3>structure and there's meaning to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>found in that too.</v>

2814
02:22:53.281 --> 02:22:58.281
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's to boldly go where no one has </v>

2815
02:22:58.281 --> 02:22:58.281
<v Speaker 3>gone before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2816
02:22:58.281 --> 02:23:01.881
<v Speaker 3>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the words of the Star Trek Writers </v>

2817
02:23:01.881 --> 02:23:04.320
<v Speaker 3>and something that deeply appeals to </v>
<v Speaker 3>young people when they watch that sort </v>

2818
02:23:04.320 --> 02:23:04.320
<v Speaker 3>of thing.</v>

2819
02:23:04.320 --> 02:23:08.420
<v Speaker 3>But so what the fundamentalists are </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing is they're trying to hold onto </v>

2820
02:23:08.420 --> 02:23:10.020
<v Speaker 3>their tradition and it's no bloody </v>
<v Speaker 3>wonder because if,</v>

2821
02:23:10.130 --> 02:23:15.130
<v Speaker 3>if the tradition falls apart,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you end up isolated and drowning in the </v>

2822
02:23:15.130 --> 02:23:19.491
<v Speaker 3>ocean alone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if the tradition gets too intense </v>

2823
02:23:19.491 --> 02:23:24.051
<v Speaker 3>and restricted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well then then you're just clones in a </v>

2824
02:23:24.051 --> 02:23:24.051
<v Speaker 3>prison.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's these.</v>

2825
02:23:24.051 --> 02:23:27.180
<v Speaker 3>That's these two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two forms of hell in a sense.</v>

2826
02:23:27.181 --> 02:23:28.080
<v Speaker 3>They meet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2827
02:23:28.110 --> 02:23:31.830
<v Speaker 3>if they get extreme enough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they meet the hell of absolute chaos and</v>

2828
02:23:31.831 --> 02:23:33.750
<v Speaker 3>the hell of absolute order.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

2829
02:23:34.200 --> 02:23:39.200
<v Speaker 3>and the Conservatives tend towards the </v>
<v Speaker 3>hail of absolute order and that and the </v>

2830
02:23:39.200 --> 02:23:41.070
<v Speaker 3>left liberal types tend towards the hell</v>
<v Speaker 3>of absolute chaos.</v>

2831
02:23:41.310 --> 02:23:46.310
<v Speaker 3>There's some point in the middle that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>the line between Yin and Yang by the </v>

2832
02:23:46.310 --> 02:23:49.641
<v Speaker 3>way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because that's order and chaos and the </v>

2833
02:23:49.641 --> 02:23:49.641
<v Speaker 3>Dow is say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2834
02:23:49.641 --> 02:23:50.070
<v Speaker 3>that's life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's existence.</v>

2835
02:23:50.130 --> 02:23:55.130
<v Speaker 3>Order in chaos and order is the place </v>
<v Speaker 3>you are when what you do works and chaos</v>

2836
02:23:55.801 --> 02:23:59.850
<v Speaker 3>is where you are when what you do </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't work and no matter where you go,</v>

2837
02:24:00.650 --> 02:24:05.580
<v Speaker 3>order and chaos exist and your job is to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be right on the border between those and</v>

2838
02:24:05.581 --> 02:24:10.581
<v Speaker 3>that's to live in Dow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's to live in meaning and that's </v>

2839
02:24:10.581 --> 02:24:13.130
<v Speaker 3>that same place where all these things </v>
<v Speaker 3>stack up and so well on.</v>

2840
02:24:13.130 --> 02:24:17.520
<v Speaker 3>So with regards to religious tradition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the one hand you have to maintain the</v>

2841
02:24:17.521 --> 02:24:22.521
<v Speaker 3>tradition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like maintaining the constitution </v>

2842
02:24:22.521 --> 02:24:22.521
<v Speaker 3>in the US.</v>
<v Speaker 3>On the other hand,</v>

2843
02:24:22.521 --> 02:24:25.950
<v Speaker 3>you have to be awake and alert because </v>
<v Speaker 3>the tradition is a dead thing,</v>

2844
02:24:25.951 --> 02:24:30.951
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was composed by dead people in the </v>

2845
02:24:30.951 --> 02:24:33.171
<v Speaker 3>dead past.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It can't respond as flexibly as it </v>

2846
02:24:33.171 --> 02:24:37.731
<v Speaker 3>should to the demands of the present.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's up to you and you do that with </v>

2847
02:24:37.731 --> 02:24:40.911
<v Speaker 3>your vision,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with your capacity to see and with your </v>

2848
02:24:40.911 --> 02:24:43.791
<v Speaker 3>capacity to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to articulate and forever forever really</v>

2849
02:24:44.430 --> 02:24:47.560
<v Speaker 3>the major deities that mankind have </v>
<v Speaker 3>produced Marta,</v>

2850
02:24:47.990 --> 02:24:52.290
<v Speaker 3>for the Mesopotamians oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cyrus or horace horace for the Egyptians</v>

2851
02:24:52.291 --> 02:24:55.440
<v Speaker 3>and and Christ for the Christians and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Buddha for the Buddhists.</v>

2852
02:24:55.710 --> 02:24:58.920
<v Speaker 3>These [inaudible] have been people who </v>
<v Speaker 3>are noted for their vision,</v>

2853
02:24:58.921 --> 02:25:03.921
<v Speaker 3>for their ability to watch and pay </v>
<v Speaker 3>attention because there's nothing more </v>

2854
02:25:03.921 --> 02:25:03.921
<v Speaker 3>important than the ability to pay </v>
<v Speaker 3>attention,</v>

2855
02:25:04.200 --> 02:25:07.110
<v Speaker 3>pay attention and speak the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your truth,</v>

2856
02:25:07.440 --> 02:25:11.520
<v Speaker 3>and that's how you keep everything </v>
<v Speaker 3>stacked up in order harmoniously.</v>

2857
02:25:11.520 --> 02:25:13.800
<v Speaker 3>That's how you keep the balance between </v>
<v Speaker 3>order and chaos.</v>

2858
02:25:13.801 --> 02:25:18.030
<v Speaker 3>That's how you articulate your being.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how you revivify the world.</v>

2859
02:25:18.031 --> 02:25:20.880
<v Speaker 3>That's how you rescue your dead father </v>
<v Speaker 3>from the bottom of the ocean.</v>

2860
02:25:21.840 --> 02:25:24.220
<v Speaker 3>That's how you adopt your responsibility</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a citizen.</v>

2861
02:25:24.850 --> 02:25:27.400
<v Speaker 3>That's how you live a proper life and a </v>
<v Speaker 3>proper life.</v>

2862
02:25:27.490 --> 02:25:31.360
<v Speaker 3>I know what a proper life is because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>thought about this for a long time.</v>

2863
02:25:31.810 --> 02:25:35.860
<v Speaker 3>Life is suffering and suffering can make</v>
<v Speaker 3>you resentful,</v>

2864
02:25:36.130 --> 02:25:41.130
<v Speaker 3>murderous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then genocidal if you take it far </v>

2865
02:25:41.130 --> 02:25:44.311
<v Speaker 3>enough so you need an antidote to </v>
<v Speaker 3>suffering and maybe you know you could </v>

2866
02:25:44.311 --> 02:25:44.311
<v Speaker 3>think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2867
02:25:44.311 --> 02:25:48.300
<v Speaker 3>I'll build walls of luxury around myself</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that'll protect me from the </v>

2868
02:25:48.300 --> 02:25:48.300
<v Speaker 3>suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2869
02:25:48.300 --> 02:25:52.261
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>good luck with that because that isn't </v>

2870
02:25:52.261 --> 02:25:54.040
<v Speaker 3>going to work and maybe you could build </v>
<v Speaker 3>a delusion and live inside that,</v>

2871
02:25:54.041 --> 02:25:55.780
<v Speaker 3>but now it's going to fall apart.</v>

2872
02:25:56.320 --> 02:26:01.320
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is there that helps you fight </v>

2873
02:26:01.320 --> 02:26:01.320
<v Speaker 3>against suffering?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's easy.</v>

2874
02:26:01.320 --> 02:26:05.790
<v Speaker 3>That's the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The truth is the antidote to suffering </v>

2875
02:26:05.790 --> 02:26:10.620
<v Speaker 3>and the reason for that is because the </v>
<v Speaker 3>truth puts reality behind you so that </v>

2876
02:26:10.620 --> 02:26:14.671
<v Speaker 3>you can face the reality that's coming </v>
<v Speaker 3>straight at you without becoming weak </v>

2877
02:26:14.671 --> 02:26:18.370
<v Speaker 3>and degenerating and becoming resentful </v>
<v Speaker 3>and wishing for the destruction of being</v>

2878
02:26:18.970 --> 02:26:23.970
<v Speaker 3>because that's the final hell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The final hail is your soul wishing for </v>

2879
02:26:24.971 --> 02:26:28.930
<v Speaker 3>the destruction of everything because </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's too painful and you're too bitter,</v>

2880
02:26:29.980 --> 02:26:32.860
<v Speaker 3>and that happens to people all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

2881
02:26:32.861 --> 02:26:37.861
<v Speaker 3>as a person who is someone who's </v>
<v Speaker 3>extremely critical of ideologies,</v>

2882
02:26:39.250 --> 02:26:44.250
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people would think it's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>contradiction for you to embrace </v>

2883
02:26:44.250 --> 02:26:47.011
<v Speaker 3>religion because religion being the </v>
<v Speaker 3>biggest and oldest ideology ideology is </v>

2884
02:26:47.011 --> 02:26:50.470
<v Speaker 3>a parasite on religious substructures.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't look.</v>

2885
02:26:51.550 --> 02:26:53.560
<v Speaker 3>We could go back to the Harry Potter </v>
<v Speaker 3>example.</v>

2886
02:26:53.620 --> 02:26:54.580
<v Speaker 3>That's a good example.</v>

2887
02:26:55.590 --> 02:27:00.590
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>jk rowling had kids reading like 400 </v>

2888
02:27:00.590 --> 02:27:00.590
<v Speaker 3>page books,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2889
02:27:00.590 --> 02:27:01.960
<v Speaker 3>She could fill a stadium when she was </v>
<v Speaker 3>reading.</v>

2890
02:27:02.110 --> 02:27:05.110
<v Speaker 3>Why is because she got the archetypes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2891
02:27:05.260 --> 02:27:07.690
<v Speaker 3>She got the religious sub narratives,</v>
<v Speaker 3>correct.</v>

2892
02:27:07.960 --> 02:27:12.100
<v Speaker 3>They're not ideologies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ideologies work because an etiology is a</v>

2893
02:27:12.101 --> 02:27:15.820
<v Speaker 3>parasite on top of a religious </v>
<v Speaker 3>substructure and a religious.</v>

2894
02:27:15.870 --> 02:27:19.450
<v Speaker 3>A religious narrative has has a </v>
<v Speaker 3>particular set of characteristics.</v>

2895
02:27:19.451 --> 02:27:22.090
<v Speaker 3>It's very balanced.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So for example,</v>

2896
02:27:22.690 --> 02:27:24.640
<v Speaker 3>there's the feminist idea of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>patriarchy.</v>

2897
02:27:25.390 --> 02:27:30.390
<v Speaker 3>While the religious idea of society has </v>
<v Speaker 3>an evil patriarchy notion built into it,</v>

2898
02:27:32.381 --> 02:27:35.620
<v Speaker 3>that would be the dying king.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The once great dying king.</v>

2899
02:27:35.621 --> 02:27:37.530
<v Speaker 3>You see this in the Egyptian story of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Osiris,</v>

2900
02:27:37.570 --> 02:27:42.570
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's eventually chopped up by his evil </v>

2901
02:27:42.570 --> 02:27:42.570
<v Speaker 3>brother.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see it in the lion king with a,</v>

2902
02:27:43.420 --> 02:27:48.420
<v Speaker 3>with a Fossa and a symbols.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Symbols farther in symbols,</v>

2903
02:27:49.240 --> 02:27:50.440
<v Speaker 3>evil,</v>
<v Speaker 3>evil uncle,</v>

2904
02:27:50.500 --> 02:27:53.350
<v Speaker 3>those are the two representatives of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>patriarchy,</v>

2905
02:27:53.620 --> 02:27:57.430
<v Speaker 3>the wise king in the tyrannical king in </v>
<v Speaker 3>a religious story,</v>

2906
02:27:57.520 --> 02:28:00.710
<v Speaker 3>properly setup archetypal story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>

2907
02:28:00.780 --> 02:28:03.310
<v Speaker 3>there's the natural world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the chaotic world.</v>

2908
02:28:03.311 --> 02:28:05.110
<v Speaker 3>There's a positive element and a </v>
<v Speaker 3>negative element.</v>

2909
02:28:05.560 --> 02:28:08.500
<v Speaker 3>There's the social world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's the wise king and the tyrannical</v>

2910
02:28:08.501 --> 02:28:13.501
<v Speaker 3>king and there's the individual world </v>
<v Speaker 3>and now it's the the adversary and the </v>

2911
02:28:13.501 --> 02:28:15.070
<v Speaker 3>hero.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's always a positive and a negative</v>

2912
02:28:15.071 --> 02:28:19.270
<v Speaker 3>at each level and it stops it from being</v>
<v Speaker 3>an oversimplification because it says to</v>

2913
02:28:19.271 --> 02:28:20.050
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2914
02:28:20.051 --> 02:28:22.070
<v Speaker 3>of course society is oppressive.</v>

2915
02:28:22.070 --> 02:28:27.070
<v Speaker 2>Patriarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's also the wise farther that has </v>

2916
02:28:27.070 --> 02:28:30.251
<v Speaker 2>taught you to speak every word you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you don't get to say only this</v>

2917
02:28:32.031 --> 02:28:35.450
<v Speaker 2>part of the story without having </v>
<v Speaker 2>gratitude for this part of this story,</v>

2918
02:28:35.990 --> 02:28:40.990
<v Speaker 2>and it's true at at each level of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>representation of properly balanced </v>

2919
02:28:40.990 --> 02:28:44.150
<v Speaker 2>story is how has got the balance between</v>
<v Speaker 2>positive and negative.</v>

2920
02:28:44.151 --> 02:28:47.300
<v Speaker 2>Always correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that in many ways,</v>

2921
02:28:47.301 --> 02:28:52.301
<v Speaker 2>like a lot of people who are anti </v>
<v Speaker 2>western capitalism are also the only.</v>

2922
02:28:53.260 --> 02:28:58.260
<v Speaker 2>They will find that capitalism in </v>
<v Speaker 2>western capitalism in particular is the </v>

2923
02:28:58.260 --> 02:29:02.021
<v Speaker 2>only culture that is embraced the </v>
<v Speaker 2>acceptance of people like transgender </v>

2924
02:29:02.871 --> 02:29:04.490
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who are gay,</v>

2925
02:29:04.491 --> 02:29:09.491
<v Speaker 2>people who are marginalized.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean Western capitalist society is one</v>

2926
02:29:10.791 --> 02:29:13.550
<v Speaker 2>of the very few cultures that openly </v>
<v Speaker 2>oppose racism.</v>

2927
02:29:13.670 --> 02:29:14.630
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

2928
02:29:14.690 --> 02:29:15.140
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2929
02:29:15.141 --> 02:29:17.810
<v Speaker 2>and these people are anticapitalist on </v>
<v Speaker 2>their iphones.</v>

2930
02:29:18.840 --> 02:29:20.300
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't get to do that.</v>

2931
02:29:20.450 --> 02:29:22.340
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a performative contradiction.</v>

2932
02:29:22.341 --> 02:29:23.780
<v Speaker 2>So that's so important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2933
02:29:23.781 --> 02:29:25.580
<v Speaker 2>They're on their iphones while they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>flying.</v>

2934
02:29:25.790 --> 02:29:26.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2935
02:29:27.350 --> 02:29:28.290
<v Speaker 2>Capitalists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

2936
02:29:28.310 --> 02:29:29.060
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually no,</v>

2937
02:29:29.061 --> 02:29:34.061
<v Speaker 2>you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're just deeply confused as what you </v>

2938
02:29:34.061 --> 02:29:34.970
<v Speaker 2>are is deeply confused.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not capitalism.</v>

2939
02:29:34.971 --> 02:29:35.960
<v Speaker 2>That's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's evil.</v>

2940
02:29:35.961 --> 02:29:38.090
<v Speaker 2>It's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>

2941
02:29:38.300 --> 02:29:43.300
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's also the deeper probe it evil is a </v>

2942
02:29:43.300 --> 02:29:46.361
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's a religious scholar named </v>

2943
02:29:46.361 --> 02:29:48.341
<v Speaker 2>Mercy Eliana who looked at flood myths </v>
<v Speaker 2>because there are flood myths all over </v>

2944
02:29:48.341 --> 02:29:48.560
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God gets fed up,</v>

2945
02:29:48.650 --> 02:29:49.810
<v Speaker 2>floods everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

2946
02:29:49.970 --> 02:29:54.970
<v Speaker 2>just like in New Orleans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So here's a funny thing about New </v>

2947
02:29:54.970 --> 02:29:58.360
<v Speaker 2>Orleans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What caused the New Orleans flood or </v>

2948
02:29:58.360 --> 02:29:58.360
<v Speaker 2>hurricane?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2949
02:29:58.360 --> 02:30:00.200
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How about human corruption?</v>

2950
02:30:00.890 --> 02:30:02.350
<v Speaker 2>How about the corruption of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

2951
02:30:02.380 --> 02:30:07.380
<v Speaker 2>of the state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How about the fact that people knew the </v>

2952
02:30:07.380 --> 02:30:07.380
<v Speaker 2>dam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dykes,</v>

2953
02:30:07.380 --> 02:30:08.510
<v Speaker 2>we're going to hold that the levies </v>
<v Speaker 2>weren't going to hold,</v>

2954
02:30:08.511 --> 02:30:13.511
<v Speaker 2>how about that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They knew that for 100 years and didn't </v>

2955
02:30:13.511 --> 02:30:13.511
<v Speaker 2>care.</v>

2956
02:30:13.511 --> 02:30:13.511
<v Speaker 2>How about that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They pocketed the money that should have</v>

2957
02:30:13.511 --> 02:30:14.900
<v Speaker 2>gone for the repair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so in flood myths,</v>

2958
02:30:14.901 --> 02:30:19.100
<v Speaker 2>you always see two things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see that I'm paraphrasing,</v>

2959
02:30:19.101 --> 02:30:23.120
<v Speaker 2>say there's a storm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's dykes,</v>

2960
02:30:23.300 --> 02:30:25.850
<v Speaker 2>and there's people responsible for </v>
<v Speaker 2>maintaining the dikes.</v>

2961
02:30:26.320 --> 02:30:28.040
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the storm will wipe out the city,</v>

2962
02:30:28.640 --> 02:30:31.520
<v Speaker 2>it could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if the dikes are high enough that it</v>

2963
02:30:31.521 --> 02:30:36.521
<v Speaker 2>won't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if people aren't corrupt and they </v>

2964
02:30:36.521 --> 02:30:38.381
<v Speaker 2>build the dikes properly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so god floods the world when the </v>

2965
02:30:38.381 --> 02:30:41.060
<v Speaker 2>dikes have rotted and the people have </v>
<v Speaker 2>become corrupt and it's a very old story</v>

2966
02:30:41.061 --> 02:30:43.520
<v Speaker 2>and it's disseminated everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the reason is as well,</v>

2967
02:30:44.090 --> 02:30:45.740
<v Speaker 2>we inhabit a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2968
02:30:46.390 --> 02:30:49.160
<v Speaker 2>a social structure that's old and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2969
02:30:49.180 --> 02:30:50.270
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and dad,</v>

2970
02:30:51.080 --> 02:30:53.630
<v Speaker 2>our infrastructures dictate our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our,</v>

2971
02:30:54.080 --> 02:30:59.080
<v Speaker 2>our political,</v>
<v Speaker 2>economic and practical infrastructure </v>

2972
02:30:59.080 --> 02:31:00.080
<v Speaker 2>has decade.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why it's old everything to case,</v>

2973
02:31:00.110 --> 02:31:02.330
<v Speaker 2>okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything's already always decaying.</v>

2974
02:31:03.140 --> 02:31:08.140
<v Speaker 2>That's dangerous and corrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People don't do a very good job of </v>

2975
02:31:08.140 --> 02:31:11.681
<v Speaker 2>keeping an order.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so if things get old and decayed </v>

2976
02:31:11.681 --> 02:31:12.170
<v Speaker 2>enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if people get corrupt enough,</v>

2977
02:31:12.230 --> 02:31:14.240
<v Speaker 2>then God floods the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

2978
02:31:14.510 --> 02:31:18.140
<v Speaker 2>Because that's what happens over and </v>
<v Speaker 2>over and over and over and over.</v>

2979
02:31:18.230 --> 02:31:20.100
<v Speaker 2>And you don't mean in the literal sense</v>

2980
02:31:20.100 --> 02:31:25.100
<v Speaker 3>of the word.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You mean God as these are the </v>

2981
02:31:25.100 --> 02:31:27.111
<v Speaker 3>consequences to these types of actions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You are not prepared for what you </v>

2982
02:31:27.111 --> 02:31:28.830
<v Speaker 3>transcended reality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could look at it that way.</v>

2983
02:31:29.380 --> 02:31:29.760
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

2984
02:31:29.970 --> 02:31:33.120
<v Speaker 3>and I mean the idea of God is a very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very complicated idea,</v>

2985
02:31:33.121 --> 02:31:38.121
<v Speaker 3>but you could say if you were thinking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about it merely merely from an </v>

2986
02:31:38.121 --> 02:31:41.811
<v Speaker 3>intellectual perspective is you could </v>
<v Speaker 3>say that God is what transcends your </v>

2987
02:31:41.811 --> 02:31:42.600
<v Speaker 3>knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's all.</v>

2988
02:31:42.720 --> 02:31:44.580
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's what you don't know.</v>

2989
02:31:44.581 --> 02:31:46.770
<v Speaker 3>It's what's outside of your knowledge </v>
<v Speaker 3>structures.</v>

2990
02:31:47.010 --> 02:31:52.010
<v Speaker 3>And there's a very old story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this goes all the way back to the </v>

2991
02:31:52.010 --> 02:31:56.180
<v Speaker 3>Tower of Babel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that one of the things that </v>

2992
02:31:56.180 --> 02:31:57.651
<v Speaker 3>characterizes authoritarians is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's never anything outside of their </v>

2993
02:31:57.651 --> 02:32:01.041
<v Speaker 3>knowledge structures.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They make their notes structures </v>

2994
02:32:01.041 --> 02:32:01.041
<v Speaker 3>absolute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in the Tower of Babel,</v>

2995
02:32:01.041 --> 02:32:03.820
<v Speaker 3>human beings build this structure that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>supposed to reach all the way to have it</v>

2996
02:32:04.710 --> 02:32:04.950
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>

2997
02:32:05.280 --> 02:32:07.350
<v Speaker 3>So that we can invade the place of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>gods.</v>

2998
02:32:07.351 --> 02:32:08.460
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God has none of that.</v>

2999
02:32:08.461 --> 02:32:11.880
<v Speaker 3>He just blows it apart and throws people</v>
<v Speaker 3>all over the world.</v>

3000
02:32:12.360 --> 02:32:17.360
<v Speaker 3>And it's a very early dramatic </v>
<v Speaker 3>representation of the danger of human </v>

3001
02:32:18.271 --> 02:32:21.660
<v Speaker 3>hubris.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And hubris is we know everything.</v>

3002
02:32:22.440 --> 02:32:25.050
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing that needs to be left </v>
<v Speaker 3>outside of what we know.</v>

3003
02:32:25.080 --> 02:32:25.880
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3004
02:32:25.890 --> 02:32:28.380
<v Speaker 3>that's what God is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God is what's always outside of what you</v>

3005
02:32:28.381 --> 02:32:33.381
<v Speaker 3>know is the problem with the term God </v>
<v Speaker 3>though the people think of God as being </v>

3006
02:32:33.381 --> 02:32:34.950
<v Speaker 3>a man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they think of it being a person.</v>

3007
02:32:34.951 --> 02:32:38.700
<v Speaker 3>They even use the masculine pronouns in </v>
<v Speaker 3>reference to God.</v>

3008
02:32:38.940 --> 02:32:43.940
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's one of the funniest things about </v>

3009
02:32:43.940 --> 02:32:43.940
<v Speaker 3>God is calling him a he.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3010
02:32:43.940 --> 02:32:43.940
<v Speaker 3>it's an APP problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3011
02:32:43.940 --> 02:32:45.390
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's certainly been a problem.</v>

3012
02:32:45.391 --> 02:32:49.470
<v Speaker 3>Young talked about that a lot about the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the exclusion of the feminine within the</v>

3013
02:32:49.471 --> 02:32:51.960
<v Speaker 3>domains of Classic Judaeo Christian </v>
<v Speaker 3>thought.</v>

3014
02:32:51.960 --> 02:32:52.710
<v Speaker 3>For example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3015
02:32:52.711 --> 02:32:55.720
<v Speaker 3>you have Mary who's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's a kind of a cause identity,</v>

3016
02:32:55.750 --> 02:33:00.750
<v Speaker 3>who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who pops in sort of like as a fourth </v>

3017
02:33:00.750 --> 02:33:03.051
<v Speaker 3>member of the trinity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the exclusion of the feminine is </v>

3018
02:33:03.051 --> 02:33:03.220
<v Speaker 3>definitely a conceptual problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3019
02:33:03.240 --> 02:33:08.100
<v Speaker 3>is the fact that God is conceptualized </v>
<v Speaker 3>as a human being or as a man a problem?</v>

3020
02:33:08.310 --> 02:33:09.750
<v Speaker 3>It's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the solution,</v>

3021
02:33:10.160 --> 02:33:13.800
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you remove the human element of God,</v>

3022
02:33:14.220 --> 02:33:19.220
<v Speaker 3>then God gets so abstract that it's easy</v>
<v Speaker 3>for him to float off into space and to </v>

3023
02:33:19.220 --> 02:33:21.810
<v Speaker 3>never show up again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can you lose the human connection?</v>

3024
02:33:21.990 --> 02:33:25.680
<v Speaker 3>I mean the way the Catholic solve that </v>
<v Speaker 3>to some degree is that they have God who</v>

3025
02:33:25.681 --> 02:33:30.681
<v Speaker 3>sort of at the top of the hierarchy and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then they have this hierarchy of saints </v>

3026
02:33:30.681 --> 02:33:32.250
<v Speaker 3>who were sort of like gods but half </v>
<v Speaker 3>human and then they have human beings at</v>

3027
02:33:32.251 --> 02:33:32.730
<v Speaker 3>the bottom.</v>

3028
02:33:33.060 --> 02:33:36.240
<v Speaker 3>And that allows for a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what would you say,</v>

3029
02:33:36.390 --> 02:33:40.410
<v Speaker 3>a continual chain of communication </v>
<v Speaker 3>between the highest level of abstraction</v>

3030
02:33:40.411 --> 02:33:42.240
<v Speaker 3>in the actual,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3031
02:33:42.241 --> 02:33:44.360
<v Speaker 3>the actual concrete person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

3032
02:33:45.010 --> 02:33:50.010
<v Speaker 3>but the other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the other thing that's useful about the </v>

3033
02:33:50.010 --> 02:33:50.880
<v Speaker 3>conceptualization of God in </v>
<v Speaker 3>anthropomorphic terms is that,</v>

3034
02:33:50.970 --> 02:33:55.970
<v Speaker 3>and this is worth noting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is there is nothing more complex in the </v>

3035
02:33:55.970 --> 02:33:59.721
<v Speaker 3>cosmos than a human being.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you're looking for something to </v>

3036
02:33:59.721 --> 02:34:01.050
<v Speaker 3>represent the ultimate didn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>complexity,</v>

3037
02:34:01.051 --> 02:34:06.051
<v Speaker 3>it's hard to beat a human being.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So your brain is ungodly complicated,</v>

3038
02:34:06.540 --> 02:34:11.540
<v Speaker 3>so to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I mean these things are obviously too</v>

3039
02:34:11.581 --> 02:34:13.650
<v Speaker 3>complicated to unpack in a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a.</v>

3040
02:34:13.830 --> 02:34:17.890
<v Speaker 3>In a way I didn't expect to get into </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation,</v>

3041
02:34:17.891 --> 02:34:18.010
<v Speaker 3>but</v>

3042
02:34:18.010 --> 02:34:19.510
<v Speaker 2>I'm glad we did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>D,</v>

3043
02:34:19.540 --> 02:34:24.540
<v Speaker 2>do you think that these stories exist </v>
<v Speaker 2>because somewhere in our code,</v>

3044
02:34:25.481 --> 02:34:30.481
<v Speaker 2>somewhere in our very being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we understand that there is a need for </v>

3045
02:34:30.821 --> 02:34:35.821
<v Speaker 2>this order to find this frequency so </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're sure they're an expression of </v>

3046
02:34:35.821 --> 02:34:40.321
<v Speaker 2>our deepest being there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're an expression of how it is that </v>

3047
02:34:40.321 --> 02:34:43.480
<v Speaker 2>we must live in order to live in order </v>
<v Speaker 2>to reach our full potential.</v>

3048
02:34:43.481 --> 02:34:45.340
<v Speaker 2>Even more than that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more than that,</v>

3049
02:34:45.341 --> 02:34:50.341
<v Speaker 2>even to avoid hell and you can take the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All you can think about hell is Nazi </v>

3050
02:34:51.100 --> 02:34:51.580
<v Speaker 2>Germany.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you want,</v>

3051
02:34:51.610 --> 02:34:56.610
<v Speaker 2>you can think about it as the Soviet </v>
<v Speaker 2>Gulag archipelago or Mao's cultural </v>

3052
02:34:56.610 --> 02:34:58.210
<v Speaker 2>revolution like we can get there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No problem.</v>

3053
02:34:58.211 --> 02:35:03.211
<v Speaker 2>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you walk down in some of the seedier </v>

3054
02:35:03.211 --> 02:35:03.211
<v Speaker 2>areas in La,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll see people in hell no problem.</v>

3055
02:35:03.220 --> 02:35:04.930
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go to skid row.</v>

3056
02:35:04.960 --> 02:35:05.650
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

3057
02:35:05.651 --> 02:35:07.960
<v Speaker 2>And you can tell where the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when those people are there,</v>

3058
02:35:07.961 --> 02:35:09.580
<v Speaker 2>because they will get angry.</v>

3059
02:35:09.580 --> 02:35:14.580
<v Speaker 2>If you look at them and you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll walk a big birth around them.</v>

3060
02:35:14.711 --> 02:35:17.440
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to come within 10 feet </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the,</v>

3061
02:35:18.250 --> 02:35:21.880
<v Speaker 2>let's call it psycho,</v>
<v Speaker 2>geography of their existence.</v>

3062
02:35:22.750 --> 02:35:23.850
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that they're,</v>

3063
02:35:23.851 --> 02:35:26.380
<v Speaker 2>they're in a place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a metaphysical place,</v>

3064
02:35:26.381 --> 02:35:27.190
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

3065
02:35:28.290 --> 02:35:31.810
<v Speaker 2>it's not defined by the dam geography,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3066
02:35:31.930 --> 02:35:35.740
<v Speaker 2>skid row is as much of a psychological </v>
<v Speaker 2>place as it is a physical place.</v>

3067
02:35:35.741 --> 02:35:40.741
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's more that Maura psychological </v>

3068
02:35:40.741 --> 02:35:42.571
<v Speaker 2>place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that doesn't make it any less a </v>

3069
02:35:42.571 --> 02:35:44.491
<v Speaker 2>place and if you're descend into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hell of skid row deep enough,</v>

3070
02:35:45.280 --> 02:35:50.280
<v Speaker 2>you'll get to the point where most of </v>
<v Speaker 2>your thoughts or murderous and that's </v>

3071
02:35:50.280 --> 02:35:50.280
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

3072
02:35:50.280 --> 02:35:52.990
<v Speaker 2>that's hell as a suburb of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>underworld.</v>

3073
02:35:52.991 --> 02:35:55.510
<v Speaker 2>Fundamentally those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that place exists.</v>

3074
02:35:55.750 --> 02:35:59.440
<v Speaker 2>People visited all the time and </v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes they don't get out.</v>

3075
02:36:00.490 --> 02:36:03.400
<v Speaker 2>It's real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been discussing this a lot recently</v>

3076
02:36:03.401 --> 02:36:05.890
<v Speaker 2>because people like to talk about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>concept of apocalypse,</v>

3077
02:36:05.891 --> 02:36:10.891
<v Speaker 2>that we're headed towards an impending </v>
<v Speaker 2>apocalypse and my thought is that </v>

3078
02:36:10.891 --> 02:36:11.080
<v Speaker 2>apocalypse is already here.</v>

3079
02:36:11.080 --> 02:36:12.500
<v Speaker 2>It's just not right here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3080
02:36:12.520 --> 02:36:15.880
<v Speaker 2>It's always go to Liberia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go to Liberia and look at people,</v>

3081
02:36:15.890 --> 02:36:18.100
<v Speaker 2>devastating this treats and eating human</v>
<v Speaker 2>flesh.</v>

3082
02:36:18.101 --> 02:36:23.101
<v Speaker 2>I mean they do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you've ever seen the </v>

3083
02:36:23.101 --> 02:36:23.101
<v Speaker 2>vice piece on Liberia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's.</v>

3084
02:36:23.101 --> 02:36:26.300
<v Speaker 2>It's unbelievably terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The whole live there,</v>

3085
02:36:26.340 --> 02:36:31.340
<v Speaker 2>the apocalypse is the apocalypse is an </v>
<v Speaker 2>archetypal idea and the apocalypse is </v>

3086
02:36:31.340 --> 02:36:34.480
<v Speaker 2>always here and it's here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's here at the micro level,</v>

3087
02:36:34.690 --> 02:36:37.520
<v Speaker 2>like when we have a discussion in our </v>
<v Speaker 2>concepts change.</v>

3088
02:36:37.521 --> 02:36:40.870
<v Speaker 2>Those are micro apocalypses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>little bits of our being are being blown</v>

3089
02:36:40.871 --> 02:36:45.871
<v Speaker 2>apart and restructured and that can be </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen at a small scale or large scale </v>

3090
02:36:45.871 --> 02:36:47.380
<v Speaker 2>or it can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can get to the point where everything</v>

3091
02:36:47.470 --> 02:36:52.470
<v Speaker 2>collapses and is destroyed and life is </v>
<v Speaker 2>apocalyptic in that matter because we </v>

3092
02:36:52.991 --> 02:36:54.460
<v Speaker 2>all get sick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We all die.</v>

3093
02:36:54.580 --> 02:36:55.570
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our families,</v>

3094
02:36:55.571 --> 02:37:00.571
<v Speaker 2>our vulnerable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's an apocalyptic element to being </v>

3095
02:37:00.571 --> 02:37:03.511
<v Speaker 2>and we and we have to face that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>confronted and deal with it properly </v>

3096
02:37:03.511 --> 02:37:07.860
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the wrong way to deal with it is to,</v>

3097
02:37:08.260 --> 02:37:13.260
<v Speaker 2>is to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is to generate more hell than heaven I </v>

3098
02:37:13.260 --> 02:37:15.100
<v Speaker 2>suppose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and to do that consciously.</v>

3099
02:37:15.110 --> 02:37:20.110
<v Speaker 2>And people do that all the time too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's never a situation that's so bad </v>

3100
02:37:20.110 --> 02:37:23.591
<v Speaker 2>that there isn't something you can do to</v>
<v Speaker 2>make it worse and there's very seldomly </v>

3101
02:37:23.591 --> 02:37:27.731
<v Speaker 2>a time when you're not motivated at some</v>
<v Speaker 2>level of your being to put the knife in </v>

3102
02:37:28.341 --> 02:37:30.680
<v Speaker 2>and twist it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just one more quarter turn.</v>

3103
02:37:31.190 --> 02:37:34.100
<v Speaker 2>People are like that and we have reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Life is hard.</v>

3104
02:37:34.130 --> 02:37:36.020
<v Speaker 2>It's no wonder people get corrupted by </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

3105
02:37:36.800 --> 02:37:40.700
<v Speaker 2>It's not an easy thing to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To live in a.</v>

3106
02:37:43.270 --> 02:37:46.870
<v Speaker 2>it's not an easy thing to live,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say in a truthful manner,</v>

3107
02:37:47.390 --> 02:37:48.790
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the alternative,</v>

3108
02:37:48.820 --> 02:37:51.390
<v Speaker 2>the alternative is hell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3109
02:37:51.400 --> 02:37:54.460
<v Speaker 2>part of the reason that I made these </v>
<v Speaker 2>videos to begin with was because,</v>

3110
02:37:55.380 --> 02:37:58.540
<v Speaker 2>and I learned a lot about the importance</v>
<v Speaker 2>of spoken truth as a,</v>

3111
02:37:58.541 --> 02:38:03.541
<v Speaker 2>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as the countervailing force against </v>

3112
02:38:03.541 --> 02:38:07.470
<v Speaker 2>tyranny and authoritarianism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It isn't an alternative political </v>

3113
02:38:07.470 --> 02:38:07.470
<v Speaker 2>structure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the countervailing force.</v>

3114
02:38:07.740 --> 02:38:08.700
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's this,</v>

3115
02:38:08.760 --> 02:38:11.290
<v Speaker 2>it's spoken truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the countervailing force.</v>

3116
02:38:11.291 --> 02:38:11.980
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3117
02:38:11.981 --> 02:38:16.981
<v Speaker 2>why would I put my job on the line to </v>
<v Speaker 2>have an opinion about compelled </v>

3118
02:38:16.981 --> 02:38:17.200
<v Speaker 2>pronouns?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know why,</v>

3119
02:38:19.710 --> 02:38:24.570
<v Speaker 2>because the ability to speak your truth </v>
<v Speaker 2>is the bulwark against hell</v>

3120
02:38:25.860 --> 02:38:28.650
<v Speaker 2>and losing your job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's nothing.</v>

3121
02:38:29.520 --> 02:38:34.320
<v Speaker 2>That's nothing compared to where things </v>
<v Speaker 2>can go when they go badly.</v>

3122
02:38:34.800 --> 02:38:39.800
<v Speaker 2>For me it was just preventative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like this isn't going in a good </v>

3123
02:38:39.800 --> 02:38:39.990
<v Speaker 2>direction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3124
02:38:39.991 --> 02:38:42.810
<v Speaker 2>should you take a risk?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you don't have that choice.</v>

3125
02:38:44.100 --> 02:38:45.990
<v Speaker 2>You're silent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a risk.</v>

3126
02:38:46.500 --> 02:38:51.500
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most people don't understand the risks </v>

3127
02:38:51.500 --> 02:38:53.331
<v Speaker 2>of silence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I happen to understand the risks of </v>

3128
02:38:53.331 --> 02:38:54.810
<v Speaker 2>sadness because I had been studying them</v>
<v Speaker 2>for 40 years.</v>

3129
02:38:55.320 --> 02:39:00.320
<v Speaker 2>Is it frustrating for you to get so </v>
<v Speaker 2>little support for these actions and </v>

3130
02:39:00.961 --> 02:39:02.260
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for your,</v>

3131
02:39:02.261 --> 02:39:04.320
<v Speaker 2>your protests?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3132
02:39:04.321 --> 02:39:06.190
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't say that that's what happened</v>

3133
02:39:06.191 --> 02:39:11.191
<v Speaker 2>and I don't mean so little support </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you're going a lot of support </v>

3134
02:39:11.191 --> 02:39:11.520
<v Speaker 2>outside of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the outside of the university.</v>

3135
02:39:12.000 --> 02:39:17.000
<v Speaker 2>It's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter where the support </v>

3136
02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:17.000
<v Speaker 2>comes from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I mean it's,</v>

3137
02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:19.320
<v Speaker 2>it's disappointing in the same way that </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's disappointing for me to say.</v>

3138
02:39:19.320 --> 02:39:21.900
<v Speaker 2>I think the universities now do more </v>
<v Speaker 2>harm than good.</v>

3139
02:39:22.380 --> 02:39:24.090
<v Speaker 2>That's disappointing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>

3140
02:39:25.110 --> 02:39:26.430
<v Speaker 2>But it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't,</v>

3141
02:39:26.490 --> 02:39:31.020
<v Speaker 2>it's not surprising to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess it isn't as if intellectuals are</v>

3142
02:39:31.021 --> 02:39:34.200
<v Speaker 2>characterized by an intrinsic moral </v>
<v Speaker 2>superiority.</v>

3143
02:39:34.201 --> 02:39:35.010
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're smart.</v>

3144
02:39:35.011 --> 02:39:37.110
<v Speaker 2>So they'll leap to the defense of what's</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

3145
02:39:37.111 --> 02:39:37.830
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3146
02:39:38.430 --> 02:39:43.380
<v Speaker 2>there's no evidence for that </v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligence and and moral wisdom aren't</v>

3147
02:39:43.650 --> 02:39:47.070
<v Speaker 2>the same thing like and if you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>corrupt and smart,</v>

3148
02:39:47.460 --> 02:39:49.650
<v Speaker 2>all that makes you is way more </v>
<v Speaker 2>treacherous.</v>

3149
02:39:49.740 --> 02:39:51.950
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make you less likely to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>corrupt.</v>

3150
02:39:51.951 --> 02:39:56.951
<v Speaker 2>It just makes you much more your 50 </v>
<v Speaker 2>snakes instead of two or your 56 headed </v>

3151
02:39:58.231 --> 02:40:01.350
<v Speaker 2>snakes instead of to like I've had </v>
<v Speaker 2>clients who were,</v>

3152
02:40:01.650 --> 02:40:03.810
<v Speaker 2>who had very serious personality </v>
<v Speaker 2>disorders,</v>

3153
02:40:03.900 --> 02:40:08.900
<v Speaker 2>who are very intelligent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like that's not necessarily a good </v>

3154
02:40:08.900 --> 02:40:10.950
<v Speaker 2>thing for them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're just better at arguing for their</v>

3155
02:40:11.400 --> 02:40:16.400
<v Speaker 2>pathology to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is a real problem where people </v>

3156
02:40:16.400 --> 02:40:18.480
<v Speaker 2>automatically assume that intelligent </v>
<v Speaker 2>people are going to be healthy.</v>

3157
02:40:19.970 --> 02:40:24.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well they're healthy in that often </v>

3158
02:40:24.970 --> 02:40:24.970
<v Speaker 2>psychological,</v>
<v Speaker 2>better in the world,</v>

3159
02:40:24.970 --> 02:40:28.301
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because because their skills are more </v>

3160
02:40:28.301 --> 02:40:29.000
<v Speaker 2>marketable and so on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's no evidence that there's any</v>

3161
02:40:29.001 --> 02:40:31.160
<v Speaker 2>relationship between intelligence and </v>
<v Speaker 2>morality.</v>

3162
02:40:31.640 --> 02:40:32.780
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

3163
02:40:32.810 --> 02:40:35.450
<v Speaker 2>let me tell you a story man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One time I have this client,</v>

3164
02:40:35.810 --> 02:40:39.140
<v Speaker 2>this woman was just ruined.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She looked like a street person,</v>

3165
02:40:39.141 --> 02:40:44.141
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and she had very dirty clothes and she </v>

3166
02:40:44.141 --> 02:40:44.141
<v Speaker 2>was so shy that she couldn't even </v>
<v Speaker 2>approach you.</v>

3167
02:40:44.141 --> 02:40:46.940
<v Speaker 2>She had to shield her eyes from you as </v>
<v Speaker 2>if you are emitting light.</v>

3168
02:40:46.941 --> 02:40:48.710
<v Speaker 2>And she did that to everyone on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>street,</v>

3169
02:40:48.711 --> 02:40:50.600
<v Speaker 2>like he was bent over and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

3170
02:40:50.990 --> 02:40:51.980
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and humble,</v>

3171
02:40:51.981 --> 02:40:56.981
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a Chinese peasant brought before </v>

3172
02:40:56.981 --> 02:40:56.981
<v Speaker 2>the emperor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

3173
02:40:56.981 --> 02:41:00.850
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things I was doing with her </v>

3174
02:41:00.850 --> 02:41:03.671
<v Speaker 2>and behavior therapy was trying to just </v>
<v Speaker 2>get her to present herself in a more </v>

3175
02:41:03.671 --> 02:41:07.361
<v Speaker 2>normal manner so that people wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>shy away from her and be instantly </v>

3176
02:41:07.361 --> 02:41:07.790
<v Speaker 2>prejudice towards her.</v>

3177
02:41:08.390 --> 02:41:12.950
<v Speaker 2>And she'd come to the behavior therapy </v>
<v Speaker 2>clinic and she wasn't bright.</v>

3178
02:41:13.010 --> 02:41:16.010
<v Speaker 2>This woman thinks she had only had like </v>
<v Speaker 2>a seventh grade education.</v>

3179
02:41:16.011 --> 02:41:18.920
<v Speaker 2>She was quite intellectually impaired </v>
<v Speaker 2>and she lived with her.</v>

3180
02:41:19.220 --> 02:41:23.210
<v Speaker 2>Her sick aunt who was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who has schizophrenia and who had a,</v>

3181
02:41:23.211 --> 02:41:28.211
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a satanic possessed alcoholic boyfriend </v>

3182
02:41:28.211 --> 02:41:32.420
<v Speaker 2>that was always tormenting my client.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She lived in absolute hell,</v>

3183
02:41:33.440 --> 02:41:38.440
<v Speaker 2>but she had this dog and she used to </v>
<v Speaker 2>take it out and walk the dog all the </v>

3184
02:41:38.440 --> 02:41:38.440
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then she,</v>

3185
02:41:38.440 --> 02:41:41.780
<v Speaker 2>she'd actually come to the behavior </v>
<v Speaker 2>therapy clinic partly because of her own</v>

3186
02:41:41.781 --> 02:41:42.290
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

3187
02:41:42.890 --> 02:41:47.890
<v Speaker 2>but she'd come to this place called the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Douglas Hospital and she'd been an </v>

3188
02:41:47.890 --> 02:41:48.320
<v Speaker 2>inpatient in the Douglas Hospital in </v>
<v Speaker 2>India,</v>

3189
02:41:48.500 --> 02:41:53.500
<v Speaker 2>in the Douglas Hospital.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were these long term psychiatric </v>

3190
02:41:53.500 --> 02:41:57.251
<v Speaker 2>clients and they looked like something </v>
<v Speaker 2>out of a Hieronymus Bosch painting or </v>

3191
02:41:57.251 --> 02:41:57.260
<v Speaker 2>Dante's inferno.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean these people were.</v>

3192
02:41:57.570 --> 02:42:00.020
<v Speaker 2>This is way worse than one flew over the</v>
<v Speaker 2>cuckoo's nest.</v>

3193
02:42:00.021 --> 02:42:03.680
<v Speaker 2>These people were seriously destroyed </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they couldn't be let back out in the</v>

3194
02:42:03.681 --> 02:42:08.681
<v Speaker 2>streets during deinstitutionalization,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they were lifers and she had </v>

3195
02:42:08.681 --> 02:42:12.851
<v Speaker 2>decided that part of the reason she </v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted to come to the hospitalist </v>

3196
02:42:12.851 --> 02:42:15.250
<v Speaker 2>because she had been institutionalized </v>
<v Speaker 2>there and she thought that maybe when </v>

3197
02:42:15.410 --> 02:42:20.410
<v Speaker 2>she took her dog out for a walk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she could go and get one of those damn </v>

3198
02:42:20.410 --> 02:42:21.050
<v Speaker 2>inmates and take them out for a walk to</v>

3199
02:42:22.520 --> 02:42:26.420
<v Speaker 2>now that was a person who is a moral </v>
<v Speaker 2>dumb as a post,</v>

3200
02:42:26.480 --> 02:42:30.710
<v Speaker 2>just screwed in 50 different directions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing going for her.</v>

3201
02:42:31.160 --> 02:42:36.160
<v Speaker 2>And she had that bloody moral capacity </v>
<v Speaker 2>to decide that there was someone worse </v>

3202
02:42:36.160 --> 02:42:40.661
<v Speaker 2>off than her and believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that wasn't easy to find and that maybe </v>

3203
02:42:40.661 --> 02:42:40.661
<v Speaker 2>she could do them some good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If,</v>

3204
02:42:40.661 --> 02:42:42.470
<v Speaker 2>if the hospital would letter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which they didn't,</v>

3205
02:42:42.500 --> 02:42:45.160
<v Speaker 2>by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3206
02:42:45.161 --> 02:42:47.650
<v Speaker 2>well that's the story of the soul.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not the intellect,</v>

3207
02:42:47.680 --> 02:42:49.890
<v Speaker 2>that's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

3208
02:42:50.550 --> 02:42:54.760
<v Speaker 2>so I didn't expect any support from my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from my colleagues.</v>

3209
02:42:56.020 --> 02:42:58.750
<v Speaker 2>And it isn't that I don't care if I got </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

3210
02:42:58.751 --> 02:43:00.910
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's in some sense it's irrelevant.</v>

3211
02:43:01.660 --> 02:43:06.160
<v Speaker 2>It's irrelevant to me because my goal </v>
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>

3212
02:43:07.690 --> 02:43:10.960
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying those God damn pronouns </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the,</v>

3213
02:43:11.290 --> 02:43:12.010
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying them</v>

3214
02:43:12.010 --> 02:43:17.010
<v Speaker 3>is because they're made up by left wing </v>
<v Speaker 3>ideologues and I don't like left wing </v>

3215
02:43:17.010 --> 02:43:21.961
<v Speaker 3>ideology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't like ediology period and I know </v>

3216
02:43:21.961 --> 02:43:22.090
<v Speaker 3>where</v>

3217
02:43:23.350 --> 02:43:27.250
<v Speaker 3>corruption of speech leads and I'm not </v>
<v Speaker 3>going there.</v>

3218
02:43:28.150 --> 02:43:33.150
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things I tried to learn when </v>

3219
02:43:33.150 --> 02:43:35.731
<v Speaker 3>I was taking apart what happened in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Auschwitz and trying to put myself in </v>

3220
02:43:35.731 --> 02:43:37.630
<v Speaker 3>the position of an Auschwitz camp guard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which by the way you can do,</v>

3221
02:43:37.631 --> 02:43:42.631
<v Speaker 3>if you use your imagination a bit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't call it exactly the world's </v>

3222
02:43:42.631 --> 02:43:46.111
<v Speaker 3>most pleasant meditative experience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can call up parts of yourself </v>

3223
02:43:46.111 --> 02:43:50.581
<v Speaker 3>that would be capable of taking someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>who just got off a transport train and </v>

3224
02:43:50.581 --> 02:43:55.201
<v Speaker 3>having them carry a 100 pound sack of </v>
<v Speaker 3>wet salt from one side of the camp </v>

3225
02:43:55.201 --> 02:43:58.030
<v Speaker 3>compound to the other and back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can conjure that part of yourself up</v>

3226
02:43:58.031 --> 02:44:03.031
<v Speaker 3>if you want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that'll teach you something about </v>

3227
02:44:03.031 --> 02:44:05.221
<v Speaker 3>what you're like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People don't do it because it's too </v>

3228
02:44:05.221 --> 02:44:08.191
<v Speaker 3>frightening,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I know perfectly well that I could </v>

3229
02:44:08.191 --> 02:44:11.041
<v Speaker 3>do that sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so once I learned that I could do </v>

3230
02:44:11.041 --> 02:44:11.041
<v Speaker 3>that sort of thing and maybe that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>could even enjoy it,</v>

3231
02:44:11.041 --> 02:44:11.590
<v Speaker 3>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

3232
02:44:11.591 --> 02:44:12.430
<v Speaker 3>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>

3233
02:44:12.700 --> 02:44:17.700
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to see if I can figure out how</v>
<v Speaker 3>to live so that if that opportunity was </v>

3234
02:44:17.700 --> 02:44:18.550
<v Speaker 3>presented to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't take it.</v>

3235
02:44:20.370 --> 02:44:25.370
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's the lesson that </v>
<v Speaker 3>people need to learn from the 20th </v>

3236
02:44:25.370 --> 02:44:25.370
<v Speaker 3>century.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like that's what human beings did.</v>

3237
02:44:25.410 --> 02:44:26.730
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well we're all human.</v>

3238
02:44:26.731 --> 02:44:28.500
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so how is it that we should live so that</v>

3239
02:44:28.501 --> 02:44:29.790
<v Speaker 3>we don't do that again?</v>

3240
02:44:31.050 --> 02:44:31.440
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3241
02:44:32.990 --> 02:44:36.050
<v Speaker 3>part of that is to try to say the truth</v>

3242
02:44:37.540 --> 02:44:42.540
<v Speaker 3>no matter what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because the alternative is worse and it </v>

3243
02:44:42.540 --> 02:44:44.260
<v Speaker 3>is worse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The truth no matter what.</v>

3244
02:44:44.290 --> 02:44:49.290
<v Speaker 3>And that is the real problem that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>see with being forced into using these </v>

3245
02:44:49.290 --> 02:44:50.590
<v Speaker 3>made up pronouns.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3246
02:44:50.591 --> 02:44:54.400
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's my language all take responsibility</v>

3247
02:44:54.401 --> 02:44:59.401
<v Speaker 3>for what I say I have not say in your </v>
<v Speaker 3>words and being compelled to say your </v>

3248
02:44:59.531 --> 02:45:01.630
<v Speaker 3>words by law.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that's that,</v>

3249
02:45:01.750 --> 02:45:02.860
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that makes it,</v>

3250
02:45:02.920 --> 02:45:06.970
<v Speaker 3>that that takes it past the point of </v>
<v Speaker 3>absurdity to the point of tyranny in,</v>

3251
02:45:06.980 --> 02:45:08.280
<v Speaker 3>in my estimation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>

3252
02:45:08.281 --> 02:45:10.690
<v Speaker 3>and I've seen some criticisms where </v>
<v Speaker 3>people are saying,</v>

3253
02:45:10.691 --> 02:45:12.520
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's talking about this,</v>

3254
02:45:12.521 --> 02:45:15.400
<v Speaker 3>but really he's grandstanding because no</v>
<v Speaker 3>one's doing anything legally,</v>

3255
02:45:15.670 --> 02:45:19.810
<v Speaker 3>but the potential exists such rubbish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that is one of the arguments.</v>

3256
02:45:20.020 --> 02:45:25.020
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they wouldn't have changed the damn </v>

3257
02:45:25.020 --> 02:45:26.371
<v Speaker 3>criminal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They put it in the hate speech category </v>

3258
02:45:26.371 --> 02:45:27.760
<v Speaker 3>and altered the criminal code.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's as simple as that,</v>

3259
02:45:27.761 --> 02:45:28.990
<v Speaker 3>and then you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3260
02:45:28.991 --> 02:45:30.160
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we didn't really mean it.</v>

3261
02:45:30.160 --> 02:45:30.820
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>

3262
02:45:30.821 --> 02:45:35.821
<v Speaker 3>you did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You really meant it to have the social </v>

3263
02:45:35.821 --> 02:45:38.131
<v Speaker 3>justice warriors that have debated being</v>
<v Speaker 3>the last two months accused me directly </v>

3264
02:45:38.131 --> 02:45:39.940
<v Speaker 3>of hate speech.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All I had to do was poke them a tiny bit</v>

3265
02:45:39.941 --> 02:45:44.941
<v Speaker 3>and they came right out with it and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>the university's legal team reviewed </v>

3266
02:45:44.941 --> 02:45:47.710
<v Speaker 3>everything I said carefully believed me </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they decided that,</v>

3267
02:45:48.040 --> 02:45:52.960
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was not only illegal to not use these</v>

3268
02:45:52.961 --> 02:45:57.961
<v Speaker 3>compelled pronouns.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was probably illegal to make a video </v>

3269
02:45:57.961 --> 02:46:00.721
<v Speaker 3>saying that I wouldn't use them because </v>
<v Speaker 3>otherwise why would they write me a </v>

3270
02:46:00.721 --> 02:46:04.501
<v Speaker 3>warning letter and tell me that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>violated university policy on the </v>

3271
02:46:04.501 --> 02:46:05.830
<v Speaker 3>Ontario Human Rights Act?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They did that lightly.</v>

3272
02:46:05.920 --> 02:46:08.770
<v Speaker 3>Have they acted on this at all?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is there they won't know.</v>

3273
02:46:08.780 --> 02:46:11.030
<v Speaker 3>Well acted in that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They sent me to warning,</v>

3274
02:46:11.050 --> 02:46:16.050
<v Speaker 3>reverse and told me to stop talking and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea that I was going to be teaching</v>

3275
02:46:16.761 --> 02:46:21.761
<v Speaker 3>in January again because I teach all my </v>
<v Speaker 3>undergraduate courses from January to </v>

3276
02:46:21.761 --> 02:46:24.080
<v Speaker 3>May that was on the table and I think </v>
<v Speaker 3>the only reason that it hasn't happened,</v>

3277
02:46:24.740 --> 02:46:29.740
<v Speaker 3>one of the reasons it hasn't happened </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm not attributing nothing but </v>

3278
02:46:29.740 --> 02:46:33.701
<v Speaker 3>malevolence to the university </v>
<v Speaker 3>administration because obviously it's </v>

3279
02:46:33.701 --> 02:46:34.010
<v Speaker 3>very complicated and they did agree to </v>
<v Speaker 3>host the debate,</v>

3280
02:46:34.011 --> 02:46:37.670
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the idea that I wouldn't be teaching</v>

3281
02:46:37.671 --> 02:46:42.671
<v Speaker 3>in January and still might not be is by </v>
<v Speaker 3>no means that was a perfectly plausible </v>

3282
02:46:46.100 --> 02:46:51.100
<v Speaker 3>outcome and had this not caused a </v>
<v Speaker 3>firestorm much of which has emerged in </v>

3283
02:46:52.101 --> 02:46:52.940
<v Speaker 3>supportive me.</v>

3284
02:46:53.570 --> 02:46:58.570
<v Speaker 3>Then I would say there was a 50 slash 50</v>
<v Speaker 3>chance that I would've had my teaching </v>

3285
02:46:58.570 --> 02:47:01.340
<v Speaker 3>privileges revoked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tabbing to other professors.</v>

3286
02:47:01.610 --> 02:47:06.610
<v Speaker 3>So the idea that I'm making it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like that this is a tempest in a </v>

3287
02:47:06.610 --> 02:47:06.610
<v Speaker 3>teapot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

3288
02:47:06.610 --> 02:47:06.610
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

3289
02:47:06.610 --> 02:47:11.501
<v Speaker 3>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why did you change the criminal code </v>

3290
02:47:11.501 --> 02:47:13.511
<v Speaker 3>then?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And why'd you put it under the hate </v>

3291
02:47:13.511 --> 02:47:13.511
<v Speaker 3>speech laws?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

3292
02:47:13.940 --> 02:47:15.890
<v Speaker 3>So no doesn't wash</v>

3293
02:47:17.460 --> 02:47:19.590
<v Speaker 3>and I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the fundamental proof of that is the</v>

3294
02:47:19.591 --> 02:47:24.591
<v Speaker 3>university's response because for sure </v>
<v Speaker 3>there are legal team crafted those </v>

3295
02:47:24.591 --> 02:47:28.650
<v Speaker 3>letters in recalcitrant employee,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're responsible for them.</v>

3296
02:47:28.651 --> 02:47:33.651
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you do with a recalcitrant </v>

3297
02:47:33.651 --> 02:47:35.361
<v Speaker 3>employed?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You write them a letter telling them </v>

3298
02:47:35.361 --> 02:47:35.361
<v Speaker 3>what they're doing wrong and asking them</v>
<v Speaker 3>to stop.</v>

3299
02:47:35.361 --> 02:47:39.620
<v Speaker 3>Then if they don't stop,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you write them a second letter that's </v>

3300
02:47:39.620 --> 02:47:39.620
<v Speaker 3>more strongly worded.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then if they don't stop,</v>

3301
02:47:39.620 --> 02:47:42.120
<v Speaker 3>you write them a third letter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even more strongly worded.</v>

3302
02:47:42.450 --> 02:47:47.010
<v Speaker 3>Then you take disciplinary action.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's like her one on one.</v>

3303
02:47:47.340 --> 02:47:49.670
<v Speaker 3>That's how you do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

3304
02:47:49.910 --> 02:47:53.580
<v Speaker 3>so here we said at the end of November,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a closing on December,</v>

3305
02:47:53.581 --> 02:47:57.600
<v Speaker 3>you're literally a a bit more than a </v>
<v Speaker 3>month away and you don't know whether or</v>

3306
02:47:57.601 --> 02:47:59.430
<v Speaker 3>not you're teaching your courses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In January,</v>

3307
02:48:06.200 --> 02:48:08.900
<v Speaker 3>it seems highly probable that I'll be </v>
<v Speaker 3>teaching them.</v>

3308
02:48:09.350 --> 02:48:12.080
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't say it's certain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if I'm teaching them,</v>

3309
02:48:12.320 --> 02:48:17.320
<v Speaker 3>it's because the cost of having me not </v>
<v Speaker 3>teach them would now be too high.</v>

3310
02:48:18.500 --> 02:48:23.500
<v Speaker 3>It's not because the university believes</v>
<v Speaker 3>that what I'm doing is either necessary </v>

3311
02:48:25.611 --> 02:48:30.611
<v Speaker 3>or acceptable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If someone who's listening to this or </v>

3312
02:48:30.611 --> 02:48:33.230
<v Speaker 3>watching this feels compelled to act out</v>
<v Speaker 3>in your support,</v>

3313
02:48:33.290 --> 02:48:34.130
<v Speaker 3>how can they do that?</v>

3314
02:48:37.230 --> 02:48:42.230
<v Speaker 3>I think they could do the future </v>
<v Speaker 3>authoring exercise and that that would </v>

3315
02:48:42.230 --> 02:48:43.880
<v Speaker 3>be the best way to act out and you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

3316
02:48:44.070 --> 02:48:48.030
<v Speaker 3>I'm dead serious about this is like sort</v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself out,</v>

3317
02:48:48.450 --> 02:48:51.490
<v Speaker 3>sort yourself out before you try to </v>
<v Speaker 3>figure out the world and the past.</v>

3318
02:48:51.690 --> 02:48:53.490
<v Speaker 3>That's the primary objective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's your,</v>

3319
02:48:53.700 --> 02:48:57.120
<v Speaker 3>that's your most important thing that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you can do so yourself out sort yourself</v>

3320
02:48:57.121 --> 02:49:02.121
<v Speaker 3>out and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and Marshall your arguments and put </v>

3321
02:49:02.121 --> 02:49:04.551
<v Speaker 3>yourself in order so that when someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>pushes you a little farther than you </v>

3322
02:49:04.681 --> 02:49:07.860
<v Speaker 3>should go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can say no and you know what's going</v>

3323
02:49:07.861 --> 02:49:08.070
<v Speaker 3>on</v>

3324
02:49:08.070 --> 02:49:08.590
