35
00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.760
<v Speaker 2>eventually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>

36
00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:29.760
<v Speaker 2>I'm like behind on every fucking thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

37
00:01:29.761 --> 00:01:31.860
<v Speaker 2>I got to put out the mastering the </v>
<v Speaker 2>twister DVD.</v>

38
00:01:31.861 --> 00:01:33.990
<v Speaker 2>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm so behind on everything,</v>

39
00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.370
<v Speaker 2>like musicians are still using my space.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of them,</v>

40
00:01:38.371 --> 00:01:39.630
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's convenient.</v>

41
00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's got that music player that you </v>

42
00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.770
<v Speaker 2>could see your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

43
00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.010
<v Speaker 2>your views or your hits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty important to music.</v>

44
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.040
<v Speaker 2>That's super important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you have thousands of hits on one of </v>

45
00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.440
<v Speaker 2>your songs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are gonna go,</v>

46
00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:53.700
<v Speaker 2>Oh shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me check that out.</v>

47
00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.610
<v Speaker 2>If there's four hits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>paper just going to bypass.</v>

48
00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.920
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when you embed a video,</v>

49
00:01:58.921 --> 00:02:01.440
<v Speaker 2>you can embed it with the number of hits</v>
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>

50
00:02:01.441 --> 00:02:05.280
<v Speaker 2>It can't show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That must be something new.</v>

51
00:02:05.281 --> 00:02:10.281
<v Speaker 2>I don't know about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you embed like a youtube clip </v>

52
00:02:10.281 --> 00:02:11.540
<v Speaker 2>or you see as the window,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't see how many videos are,</v>

53
00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.380
<v Speaker 2>how many people have watched this for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

54
00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.500
<v Speaker 2>but that would be a good feature I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think.</v>

55
00:02:16.501 --> 00:02:19.050
<v Speaker 2>But no one goes on my space anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

56
00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.850
<v Speaker 2>I'm always on my website.</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 Planet j Dot j Dot Com.</v>

57
00:02:22.851 --> 00:02:24.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm on that motherfucker like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

58
00:02:24.751 --> 00:02:27.450
<v Speaker 2>like Joe on twitter and shit all day.</v>

59
00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.790
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if they want to see your music </v>

60
00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:35.460
<v Speaker 2>though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they could still go to myspace.com/the</v>

61
00:02:35.461 --> 00:02:38.210
<v Speaker 2>twister.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are all old videos and shit.</v>

62
00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.830
<v Speaker 2>They're like three or four years now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Old.</v>

63
00:02:40.831 --> 00:02:42.480
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they're still bad ass.</v>

64
00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:45.120
<v Speaker 1>Brian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing over there,</v>

65
00:02:45.121 --> 00:02:46.350
<v Speaker 1>buddy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just fine.</v>

66
00:02:46.351 --> 00:02:48.120
<v Speaker 1>Tweaking the audio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fine.</v>

67
00:02:48.121 --> 00:02:51.540
<v Speaker 1>Tweaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Find does become quite a podcast mogul.</v>

68
00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.540
<v Speaker 1>He's been broadcasting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just this podcast,</v>

69
00:02:54.541 --> 00:02:59.541
<v Speaker 1>but the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the unfortunate brody Stevens projects </v>

70
00:02:59.541 --> 00:02:59.541
<v Speaker 1>that was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you watch any of that?</v>

71
00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:01.080
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

72
00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:05.740
<v Speaker 3>what was your going and call it that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The unfortunate brody's project.</v>

73
00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:08.500
<v Speaker 3>It looks like he's going crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

74
00:03:08.501 --> 00:03:11.920
<v Speaker 3>Then that way he's allowed to get crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just think I need a taser though,</v>

75
00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.400
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think if we do that,</v>

76
00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.260
<v Speaker 3>it's a character character.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just it's like,</v>

77
00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.420
<v Speaker 3>I think it works great for standup </v>
<v Speaker 3>comedy,</v>

78
00:03:19.421 --> 00:03:21.330
<v Speaker 3>but I think for a podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

79
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.030
<v Speaker 3>it was hard because I felt bad for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>last episode.</v>

80
00:03:25.031 --> 00:03:30.031
<v Speaker 3>He brought his roommate on again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any screamed at his roommate the whole </v>

81
00:03:30.031 --> 00:03:33.550
<v Speaker 3>time to the point where his roommate I </v>
<v Speaker 3>saw look like close to him and his cheek</v>

82
00:03:33.551 --> 00:03:38.551
<v Speaker 3>was twitching because he was so upset </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then I went outside because I was </v>

83
00:03:38.651 --> 00:03:43.651
<v Speaker 3>freaking out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went outside and he comes running </v>

84
00:03:43.651 --> 00:03:46.411
<v Speaker 3>outside and goes like in the middle of </v>
<v Speaker 3>an interview he just took off and brody </v>

85
00:03:46.411 --> 00:03:46.630
<v Speaker 3>was just left there on the couch going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh well,</v>

86
00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:47.890
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what he was doing,</v>

87
00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.450
<v Speaker 3>but the guy who's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't take this anymore.</v>

88
00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:50.800
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't take this anymore.</v>

89
00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.930
<v Speaker 3>And like he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he just got raped.</v>

90
00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.980
<v Speaker 3>That's what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what,</v>

91
00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:59.010
<v Speaker 3>that's what the conversation was and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's when it came to the conclusion </v>

92
00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:00.340
<v Speaker 3>that what happened is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that they act together.</v>

93
00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:05.440
<v Speaker 3>Him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>brody Stevens in his roommate act </v>

94
00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.411
<v Speaker 3>together,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if a couple were to break up and </v>

95
00:04:07.411 --> 00:04:07.411
<v Speaker 3>they had to live together for like three</v>
<v Speaker 3>months,</v>

96
00:04:07.411 --> 00:04:07.700
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that,</v>

97
00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:12.010
<v Speaker 3>that anger kind of that and it just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

98
00:04:12.011 --> 00:04:12.780
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It freaked me out.</v>

99
00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:13.170
<v Speaker 3>Real</v>

100
00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.370

<v Speaker 1>they're breaking up but they still </v>

102
00:04:20.371 --> 00:04:20.371
<v Speaker 1>haven't moved out yet and then the chick</v>
<v Speaker 1>start seeing another dude.</v>

103
00:04:20.371 --> 00:04:24.831
<v Speaker 1>Then they have complications or the guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>starts seem the check that that would </v>

104
00:04:27.211 --> 00:04:29.850
<v Speaker 1>never happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would never put myself to that.</v>

105
00:04:29.851 --> 00:04:32.730
<v Speaker 1>I mean you have to be a brokester and </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand or some kind of.</v>

106
00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.310

<v Speaker 1>lease or something.</v>

107
00:04:35.311 --> 00:04:36.900
<v Speaker 1>Maybe there's like a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're both on.</v>

108
00:04:36.901 --> 00:04:39.750
<v Speaker 1>People just love drama.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They never figured it out.</v>

109
00:04:39.751 --> 00:04:42.740
<v Speaker 1>They never figured out how to be cool </v>
<v Speaker 1>with each other from the moment of their</v>

110
00:04:42.741 --> 00:04:43.910
<v Speaker 1>relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just a,</v>

111
00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.170
<v Speaker 1>it's an eventual explosion.</v>

<v Speaker 1>time to maybe change your mind.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

121
00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:09.690

<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

122
00:05:09.691 --> 00:05:12.780
<v Speaker 1>I lived with a chick a long time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first time I've ever lived with very</v>

123
00:05:12.781 --> 00:05:14.400
<v Speaker 1>nice girl,</v>

<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was 21,</v>

125
00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:17.160
<v Speaker 1>she was 20.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were both retarded.</v>

126
00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:18.550
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

127
00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:21.240
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I lived with her and we broke up,</v>

128
00:05:21.241 --> 00:05:26.241
<v Speaker 1>there was a period of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like for like two weeks we were still </v>

129
00:05:26.241 --> 00:05:28.260
<v Speaker 1>together and she was still like staying </v>
<v Speaker 1>in my house,</v>

130
00:05:28.261 --> 00:05:30.690
<v Speaker 1>but we were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were not together anymore.</v>

131
00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:35.730
<v Speaker 1>We'd broken up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she had started dating other dudes </v>

132
00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:35.730
<v Speaker 1>and I'd start dating other checks and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

133
00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:40.470
<v Speaker 1>she'd be cool with it and then she would</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell me about dudes and I wouldn't get </v>

134
00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:40.470
<v Speaker 1>jealous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I would tell her about a chicken.</v>

135
00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:44.370
<v Speaker 1>She get mad at me within two weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's 20 years old,</v>

136
00:05:44.371 --> 00:05:45.360
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twelve years old.</v>

137
00:05:45.361 --> 00:05:50.361
<v Speaker 1>You're retarded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't know what the fuck's going on </v>

138
00:05:50.361 --> 00:05:50.361
<v Speaker 1>in love with her?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

139
00:05:50.361 --> 00:05:50.520
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

140
00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:52.350
<v Speaker 1>Definitely not because I didn't freak </v>
<v Speaker 1>out when she left,</v>

141
00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:57.120
<v Speaker 1>although I did try to get her back on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I came off like a huge.</v>

142
00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:57.980
<v Speaker 1>I</v>

143
00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:59.440
<v Speaker 4>don't know if you've ever done that </v>
<v Speaker 4>before.</v>

144
00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:04.630
<v Speaker 4>When you get devastated by a check and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then you try to figure out a way to </v>

145
00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:04.760
<v Speaker 4>bring a bag.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's almost like an ego thing really.</v>

146
00:06:04.761 --> 00:06:07.190
<v Speaker 4>It's like the relationship was boring.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did she break over there?</v>

147
00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:07.730
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

148
00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:13.530
<v Speaker 4>That hurts now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How long were you guys living together </v>

149
00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:13.530
<v Speaker 4>before?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not that long,</v>

150
00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:14.180
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did not last very long.</v>

151
00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:16.310
<v Speaker 4>It was a disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Six months maybe.</v>

152
00:06:16.311 --> 00:06:18.010
<v Speaker 4>Something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not enough.</v>

153
00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:23.200
<v Speaker 4>You can get deep and six maybe not even.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to think it was six </v>

154
00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:23.200
<v Speaker 4>months.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She was a nice kid.</v>

155
00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:27.641
<v Speaker 4>We were just young and stupid and.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But she started banging other dudes and </v>

156
00:06:27.641 --> 00:06:27.830
<v Speaker 4>I started banging on the trucks and it </v>
<v Speaker 4>was,</v>

157
00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:31.550
<v Speaker 4>it was real weird because we're living </v>
<v Speaker 4>together and every now and then like she</v>

158
00:06:31.551 --> 00:06:32.960
<v Speaker 4>would get horny and I'd fuck her anyway.</v>

159
00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:34.610
<v Speaker 4>It would be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was very strange.</v>

160
00:06:34.611 --> 00:06:37.040
<v Speaker 4>It was like a retard retard </v>
<v Speaker 4>relationship.</v>

161
00:06:37.041 --> 00:06:42.041
<v Speaker 4>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like the shit you do when you're 21 </v>

162
00:06:42.041 --> 00:06:44.410
<v Speaker 4>usually.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Generally when someone breaks up the </v>

163
00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:48.650
<v Speaker 4>girl generally for most people the girl </v>
<v Speaker 4>has so much more power than the guy.</v>

164
00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:53.770
<v Speaker 4>The girl can bank 10 dudes that day they</v>
<v Speaker 4>broke up like the guy like the guy might</v>

165
00:06:54.681 --> 00:06:56.780
<v Speaker 4>not be able to get laid for a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 4>weeks.</v>

166
00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:03.760
<v Speaker 4>He hasn't been in the game for awhile </v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's the reason why they're </v>

167
00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:03.760
<v Speaker 4>breaking up was because the guy found </v>
<v Speaker 4>someone to already.</v>

168
00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:05.500
<v Speaker 4>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's track tracking.</v>

<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

171
00:07:10.161 --> 00:07:15.161

<v Speaker 4>It's not nearly as easy to go out and </v>

172
00:07:15.161 --> 00:07:15.530
<v Speaker 4>meet people or going to a bar or club or</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>

<v Speaker 3>in the character,</v>

<v Speaker 3>that's ridiculous.</v>

277
00:11:41.090 --> 00:11:46.090
<v Speaker 3>For a month though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was the only time I ever became </v>

278
00:11:46.090 --> 00:11:46.290
<v Speaker 3>addicted to my little nephew.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's his problem right now.</v>

279
00:11:46.291 --> 00:11:51.291
<v Speaker 3>They got to take away that fucking game </v>
<v Speaker 3>controller because he plays all fucking </v>

00:11:51.291 --> 00:11:51.930
<v Speaker 3>dates,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking up his grades and all that Shit.</v>

<v Speaker 3>And my sister's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

282

283
00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:56.200
<v Speaker 4>let them have that video game on </v>
<v Speaker 4>weekends.</v>

284
00:11:56.201 --> 00:12:01.201
<v Speaker 4>And they got,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they take the controllers and they </v>

<v Speaker 4>like a video game controller,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like dealer at school.</v>

<v Speaker 4>How easy is that?</v>

289
00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:12.820
<v Speaker 4>I'm real lucky that I didn't have video </v>
<v Speaker 4>games when I was a kid.</v>

290
00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:16.620
<v Speaker 4>I mean we have like stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the ones on tv that you,</v>

291
00:12:16.621 --> 00:12:18.670

<v Speaker 4>high school,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had a Atari the peasant later.</v>

295
00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:29.350
<v Speaker 4>That was all I had.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That wasn't data addictive.</v>

296
00:12:29.410 --> 00:12:32.680
<v Speaker 4>I mean it was okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's nothing like call of duty or</v>

297
00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:34.420
<v Speaker 4>it was amazing back then.</v>

<v Speaker 4>diction value of it.</v>

301
00:12:40.601 --> 00:12:42.380
<v Speaker 4>It's not even close to the video game </v>

<v Speaker 4>All on the same as you can get more </v>
<v Speaker 4>creative with gay porn,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Well you've got a bad connection on the </v>

383
00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:07.660
<v Speaker 4>headsets.</v>

<v Speaker 4>it's in there,</v>

385
00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:14.030
<v Speaker 4>but it looks way better than the movies </v>
<v Speaker 4>because movie theaters,</v>

386
00:16:14.031 --> 00:16:16.220
<v Speaker 4>it's like kind of shitty resolution.</v>

<v Speaker 4>It looks like grainy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

388
00:16:17.751 --> 00:16:18.860
<v Speaker 4>even if it's a gi,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's better.</v>

389
00:16:19.070 --> 00:16:22.280
<v Speaker 4>Even if it's a giant screen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not nearly as good as like a giant,</v>

390
00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:27.310
<v Speaker 4>like 55 inch plasma screen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The depth that you get when you look at </v>

391
00:16:27.310 --> 00:16:31.181
<v Speaker 4>it like a real good tv.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's like the resolutions like way </v>

<v Speaker 4>To listen to that.</v>

418
00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:44.950
<v Speaker 4>Like you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're the king of dirt or you're the </v>

419
00:17:44.950 --> 00:17:48.161
<v Speaker 4>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whenever you talk about anybody where </v>

420
00:17:48.161 --> 00:17:49.980
<v Speaker 4>anybody looks towards someone getting </v>
<v Speaker 4>damaged from fighting</v>

421
00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:52.830
<v Speaker 1>in it being a sad case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's the one and there's a lot of people</v>

422
00:17:52.831 --> 00:17:54.240
<v Speaker 1>that are trying to say that he has </v>
<v Speaker 1>Parkinson's.</v>

423
00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:56.160
<v Speaker 1>It's not related the fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not related.</v>

424
00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:58.920
<v Speaker 1>That's a bullshit politically correct </v>
<v Speaker 1>argument.</v>

425
00:17:59.070 --> 00:18:00.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got Parkinson's.</v>

426
00:18:00.211 --> 00:18:05.211
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means it's fucking brain is falling </v>

427
00:18:05.211 --> 00:18:07.131
<v Speaker 1>apart and why do you think he has it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't think that has to do with the </v>

428
00:18:07.131 --> 00:18:08.330
<v Speaker 1>fact that he got battered in the brain </v>
<v Speaker 1>for decades.</v>

429
00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:09.660
<v Speaker 1>You don't think that has something to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>with that.</v>

430
00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:14.840
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had this thing on 48 hours with </v>

431
00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:17.511
<v Speaker 1>Jerry quarry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jerry quarry was like this great white </v>

432
00:18:17.511 --> 00:18:19.881
<v Speaker 1>hope from the 19 seventies and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>followed this dude around and he was </v>

433
00:18:20.530 --> 00:18:25.530
<v Speaker 1>like 53 years old when he died and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>followed him around when he was 50 and </v>

434
00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:25.920
<v Speaker 1>he was gone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gone.</v>

435
00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:28.560
<v Speaker 1>There was nothing there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had no idea what was going on,</v>

436
00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:29.730
<v Speaker 1>didn't know how to write his name.</v>

437
00:18:29.730 --> 00:18:31.980
<v Speaker 1>His brother had to help him write it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he had Lou Gehrig's disease.</v>

438
00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:34.770
<v Speaker 1>He had everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had pugilistic dementia,</v>

439
00:18:34.771 --> 00:18:36.570
<v Speaker 1>that's what they call it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what they were calling it.</v>

440
00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:38.640
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as far as is it Lou Gehrig's disease?</v>

441
00:18:38.950 --> 00:18:42.330
<v Speaker 1>Lou Gehrig's disease is is the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that Stephen Hawking has.</v>

442
00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:43.760
<v Speaker 1>It's your,</v>

00:18:48.761 --> 00:18:49.140
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Muhammad Ali has Parkinson's,</v>

446
00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:51.510

<v Speaker 1>this guy had pugilistic dementia,</v>

447
00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:54.270
<v Speaker 1>which is just dementia brought on by </v>
<v Speaker 1>being punched.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's the thing.</v>

00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:33.380
<v Speaker 1>Remember Alastar overeem when he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting knocked out all the time and I </v>

462
00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:36.530
<v Speaker 1>lost our overeem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was getting like jacked over and over </v>

463
00:19:36.530 --> 00:19:36.530
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Surgery Keratan off Jack Damn.</v>

464
00:19:36.530 --> 00:19:37.500
<v Speaker 1>Chuck Odell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jack Them,</v>

465
00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:42.710
<v Speaker 1>a lot of guys stopped him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's been stopped like seven or </v>

466
00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:42.710
<v Speaker 1>eight times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least six.</v>

467
00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:47.260
<v Speaker 1>So I mean he had been beaten up a bunch </v>
<v Speaker 1>of times both in kickboxing and in an,</v>

468
00:19:47.570 --> 00:19:52.570
<v Speaker 1>in an mma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then all of a sudden he makes his </v>

469
00:19:52.570 --> 00:19:54.621
<v Speaker 1>fucking tremendous come back and now </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's one of the best fighters in the </v>

470
00:19:54.621 --> 00:19:54.621
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

471
00:19:54.621 --> 00:19:58.160
<v Speaker 1>So it's like you can't never say that a </v>
<v Speaker 1>dude's done because he made a comeback </v>

472
00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:00.330
<v Speaker 1>and then made a Sitcom back in striking </v>
<v Speaker 1>and k one,</v>

473
00:20:00.570 --> 00:20:05.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that he was able to have that </v>

474
00:20:05.570 --> 00:20:05.570
<v Speaker 1>kind of success in just straight </v>
<v Speaker 1>striking.</v>

475
00:20:05.570 --> 00:20:05.570
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

476
00:20:05.570 --> 00:20:08.370
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty God damn process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can't tell it got to stop because</v>

477
00:20:08.371 --> 00:20:09.810
<v Speaker 1>I would have told Alastar over him and </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

478
00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:10.680
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who the fuck are you?</v>

479
00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:14.020
<v Speaker 1>When do you draw the line?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it five cows for cows?</v>

480
00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:19.520
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think Peter has been stopped some </v>

481
00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:21.981
<v Speaker 1>crazy amount of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like 14 times over the course of his </v>

482
00:20:21.981 --> 00:20:25.041
<v Speaker 1>career to something nutty like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think about that,</v>

483
00:20:25.221 --> 00:20:25.780
<v Speaker 1>huh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

484
00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:31.480
<v Speaker 1>What if they find out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if they find [inaudible] get to is </v>

485
00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:31.480
<v Speaker 1>fairly new.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did they find out that,</v>

486
00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:34.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you get choked out like unconscious,</v>

487
00:20:34.591 --> 00:20:39.591
<v Speaker 1>like from a rear naked choke or at Doris</v>
<v Speaker 1>or something like 20 slash 25 times </v>

488
00:20:39.591 --> 00:20:43.430
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're susceptible to get Lou gehrig's </v>

489
00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:43.430
<v Speaker 1>disease just from getting,</v>

491
00:20:44.770 --> 00:20:47.980
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say that they know that you</v>

492
00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:52.980
<v Speaker 4>can be deprived of blood to the brain </v>
<v Speaker 4>for a certain amount of time before </v>

493
00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:53.470
<v Speaker 4>there's damage set in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but how do they know that?</v>

494
00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:58.740
<v Speaker 4>I mean they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they know that people have gotten </v>

495
00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:00.931
<v Speaker 4>damaged because there had blood shut off</v>
<v Speaker 4>to their brain for x amount of seconds </v>

496
00:21:00.931 --> 00:21:02.050
<v Speaker 4>or x or is it a minute?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean how,</v>

497
00:21:02.110 --> 00:21:05.050
<v Speaker 4>what is the amount of time where you </v>
<v Speaker 4>start getting brain damage?</v>

498
00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:06.220
<v Speaker 4>Number two,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>

499
00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:08.980
<v Speaker 4>This one's where you're saying like if </v>
<v Speaker 4>you really hated somebody,</v>

500
00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:10.690
<v Speaker 4>you'd choke them out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but not to kill them,</v>

501
00:21:10.750 --> 00:21:15.750
<v Speaker 4>just hold on for 90 seconds and started </v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's a character who wanted to </v>

502
00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:17.650
<v Speaker 4>develop a guy who's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's like a,</v>

503
00:21:17.710 --> 00:21:20.200
<v Speaker 4>like a dexter or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he just kills people,</v>

504
00:21:20.201 --> 00:21:25.201
<v Speaker 4>but he doesn't kill him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He just chokes him out just for 58 </v>

505
00:21:25.201 --> 00:21:26.980
<v Speaker 4>seconds just to turn them into a </v>
<v Speaker 4>vegetable so he doesn't,</v>

506
00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:28.450
<v Speaker 4>he doesn't go down for murder.</v>

507
00:21:28.450 --> 00:21:33.450
<v Speaker 4>No one knows how this person became a </v>
<v Speaker 4>vegetable and they just make it a </v>

508
00:21:33.450 --> 00:21:37.261
<v Speaker 4>romantic comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then like one dude and the conflict </v>

509
00:21:37.261 --> 00:21:38.920
<v Speaker 4>is three jokes becomes a level,</v>
<v Speaker 4>does it for money.</v>

510
00:21:38.921 --> 00:21:41.230
<v Speaker 4>He's just like the secret assassin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's not killing anybody.</v>

511
00:21:41.231 --> 00:21:43.540
<v Speaker 4>He's just turning your enemies into like</v>
<v Speaker 4>you pay them.</v>

512
00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:48.780
<v Speaker 4>And then one guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he didn't choke long enough and the guy </v>

513
00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:51.241
<v Speaker 4>can kind of talk and he's trying to bust</v>
<v Speaker 4>them out so he has to figure out how to </v>

514
00:21:51.241 --> 00:21:53.410
<v Speaker 4>fucking get near him again to choke them</v>
<v Speaker 4>out of the guys pointing out was like,</v>

515
00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:57.550
<v Speaker 4>I got to put this motherfucker and an </v>
<v Speaker 4>arm triangle one more time.</v>

516
00:21:58.910 --> 00:22:03.270
<v Speaker 4>But Tom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it just,</v>

517
00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:06.060
<v Speaker 4>so that missile thing a lot of people </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't notice,</v>

518
00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:10.750
<v Speaker 4>but there was a missile was fired last </v>
<v Speaker 4>night off of the coast of California.</v>

519
00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:12.370
<v Speaker 4>Malibu area.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 4>morning.</v>

521
00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:15.400
<v Speaker 4>And he said that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

522
00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:16.630

<v Speaker 4>that's where he lives.</v>

523
00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:19.630
<v Speaker 4>He didn't see anything and he had all </v>
<v Speaker 4>these radio show.</v>

524
00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:22.420
<v Speaker 4>Carson Daly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Carson Daly has a radio show on k rock.</v>

525
00:22:22.421 --> 00:22:23.550
<v Speaker 4>I think he does.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 4>In the morning kid rock is Kevin and </v>
<v Speaker 4>been a,</v>

527
00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:29.210
<v Speaker 4>I think maybe after,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

528
00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:30.180
<v Speaker 4>but he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

529
00:22:30.190 --> 00:22:35.190
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was saying that he didn't see </v>

530
00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:36.481
<v Speaker 4>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he had all these callers calling and </v>

531
00:22:36.481 --> 00:22:37.720
<v Speaker 4>then it was like two hours later </v>
<v Speaker 4>everyone said they saw something but not</v>

532
00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:39.550
<v Speaker 4>with the time that everyone else is </v>
<v Speaker 4>saying so.</v>

533
00:22:39.690 --> 00:22:40.980
<v Speaker 4>Well they have pictures of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

534
00:22:41.010 --> 00:22:42.520
<v Speaker 4>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Something happened.</v>

535
00:22:42.521 --> 00:22:43.960
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was one before that happened.</v>

536
00:22:43.961 --> 00:22:48.670
<v Speaker 4>I remember I was driving,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was in Hollywood and the sky was like,</v>

537
00:22:48.671 --> 00:22:52.210
<v Speaker 4>it was just turning dusk,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it was kinda like half dark,</v>

538
00:22:52.211 --> 00:22:55.030
<v Speaker 4>half light.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they launched a rocket and you could</v>

539
00:22:55.031 --> 00:23:00.031
<v Speaker 4>really see whatever this thing was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this missile you could really see like </v>

540
00:23:00.031 --> 00:23:00.280
<v Speaker 4>the contrary all behind it and </v>
<v Speaker 4>everything.</v>

541
00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:01.930
<v Speaker 4>It was pretty dramatic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

542
00:23:01.931 --> 00:23:03.220
<v Speaker 4>And then they had a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

543
00:23:03.290 --> 00:23:07.770
<v Speaker 4>tell people that they do these things at</v>
<v Speaker 4>night and that this one was a,</v>

544
00:23:07.820 --> 00:23:10.600
<v Speaker 4>it was from at Edwards Air Force Base I </v>
<v Speaker 4>guess,</v>

545
00:23:10.810 --> 00:23:13.210
<v Speaker 4>and they shot it at night,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was just not dark enough.</v>

546
00:23:13.211 --> 00:23:15.220
<v Speaker 4>They miscalculated the time so people </v>
<v Speaker 4>get to see it.</v>

547
00:23:15.430 --> 00:23:17.170
<v Speaker 4>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what do you mean they just shoot shit up</v>

548
00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:19.810
<v Speaker 4>in the air.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did they do this all the time?</v>

549
00:23:19.870 --> 00:23:20.920
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My friend is in the navy,</v>

550
00:23:20.921 --> 00:23:25.921
<v Speaker 4>says they shoot missiles all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where do they go to the water shoot dead</v>

551
00:23:28.271 --> 00:23:33.271
<v Speaker 4>missiles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And imagine if you were in a fucking </v>

552
00:23:33.271 --> 00:23:35.550
<v Speaker 4>rowboat and nobody knew you were out </v>
<v Speaker 4>there and you got hit in the head by a </v>

553
00:23:35.550 --> 00:23:38.671
<v Speaker 4>missile.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just a random mean people have been </v>

554
00:23:38.671 --> 00:23:41.911
<v Speaker 4>shot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They've been shot by people shooting up </v>

555
00:23:41.911 --> 00:23:43.951
<v Speaker 4>in the air.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The bullet goes up in the air and then </v>

556
00:23:43.951 --> 00:23:43.951
<v Speaker 4>lands on people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's happened a bunch of times.</v>

557
00:23:43.951 --> 00:23:45.500
<v Speaker 4>Could you imagine if you got hit in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>head by a mess?</v>

558
00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:48.950

<v Speaker 1>outside and we're just talking kind of </v>

575
00:24:31.871 --> 00:24:32.630
<v Speaker 1>like straight real conspiracy theory.</v>

576
00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:35.830
<v Speaker 1>Alex Jones style.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he brings Joey in and we.</v>

577
00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:38.540
<v Speaker 1>We were at the end of the show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he goes,</v>

578
00:24:38.541 --> 00:24:43.541
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to go into overdrive right </v>

579
00:24:43.541 --> 00:24:44.510
<v Speaker 1>now and we're going to overdraft super </v>
<v Speaker 1>secret overdrive a lot on the Internet,</v>

580
00:24:44.570 --> 00:24:45.200
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

581
00:24:45.201 --> 00:24:46.670
<v Speaker 1>you can swear it's all right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not FCC,</v>

582
00:24:46.671 --> 00:24:48.980
<v Speaker 1>but don't try not to swear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So He'd fucked up.</v>

583
00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:54.040
<v Speaker 1>He gave the green light to joey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He let joey know that Joey can just go </v>

584
00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:54.470
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so joey starts going off.</v>

585
00:24:54.471 --> 00:24:56.390
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's going off about Cuba,</v>

586
00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:59.840
<v Speaker 1>about how this is a free country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

587
00:24:59.870 --> 00:25:02.180
<v Speaker 1>the real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it really went awry,</v>

588
00:25:02.260 --> 00:25:04.460
<v Speaker 1>it was when he started talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>smuggling drugs.</v>

589
00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:06.140
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got get on the plane.</v>

590
00:25:06.290 --> 00:25:11.290
<v Speaker 1>I had the sack under my ball sack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I put the sack of weed and I was </v>

591
00:25:11.290 --> 00:25:12.350
<v Speaker 1>thinking like a motherfucker and he's </v>

599
00:25:20.801 --> 00:25:23.060
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he just goes deep.</v>

600
00:25:23.061 --> 00:25:26.630
<v Speaker 1>Joey dss as an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as Alex Jones is going.</v>

601
00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:27.980

<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That didn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

603
00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:30.390
<v Speaker 1>it didn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cox,</v>

604
00:25:30.391 --> 00:25:32.720
<v Speaker 1>I got Obama freedom of speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So He's,</v>

605
00:25:32.750 --> 00:25:34.850
<v Speaker 1>he's going fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

606
00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:39.560
<v Speaker 1>Alex Jones can't figure out what to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I am laughing my balls off.</v>

607
00:25:39.590 --> 00:25:40.910
<v Speaker 1>So as I'm laughing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

608
00:25:40.911 --> 00:25:45.911
<v Speaker 1>Joey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he's got an audience and that </v>

609
00:25:45.911 --> 00:25:45.911
<v Speaker 1>audience is laughing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joey knows how to finish the ages.</v>

610
00:25:45.911 --> 00:25:47.720
<v Speaker 1>Ages rage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It gets red,</v>

611
00:25:47.721 --> 00:25:50.810
<v Speaker 1>he starts getting sweaty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he knows how to finish the deal.</v>

612
00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:55.900
<v Speaker 1>So he's going off about how stinky this </v>
<v Speaker 1>weed is under his ball sack and that </v>

613
00:25:55.900 --> 00:25:59.741
<v Speaker 1>he'd go through the x ray machine and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought he was going to have to get </v>

614
00:25:59.741 --> 00:25:59.741
<v Speaker 1>arrested.</v>

615
00:25:59.741 --> 00:26:00.890
<v Speaker 1>And then the more more Alex Jones </v>
<v Speaker 1>protests,</v>

616
00:26:00.891 --> 00:26:02.750
<v Speaker 1>the crazier guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>joey finally,</v>

617
00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:04.160
<v Speaker 1>you know Joe,</v>

<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

619
00:26:05.451 --> 00:26:06.890
<v Speaker 1>He's going to end something and walk </v>
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>

620
00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:08.960
<v Speaker 1>He's in a fury of frenzy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

621
00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:10.580
<v Speaker 1>Joe Def,</v>
<v Speaker 1>facebook,</v>

622
00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:12.290
<v Speaker 1>twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He stands up and he goes,</v>

623
00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:14.690
<v Speaker 1>check yourself before you wreck </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

624
00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:19.750
<v Speaker 1>Big Dixon gas is bad for your health.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stay black because that's the most </v>

625
00:26:19.750 --> 00:26:19.910
<v Speaker 1>important thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to stay black.</v>

626
00:26:20.470 --> 00:26:25.470
<v Speaker 1>And the whole time he's screaming into </v>
<v Speaker 1>the microphone to make it worse so you </v>

627
00:26:25.470 --> 00:26:25.470
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

628
00:26:25.470 --> 00:26:28.850
<v Speaker 1>he's grabbing the microphone is big paws</v>
<v Speaker 1>and screaming into the best part is when</v>

629
00:26:28.851 --> 00:26:33.851
<v Speaker 1>he first walked into like Alex Jones as </v>
<v Speaker 1>studio setup where the camera's facing </v>

630
00:26:33.851 --> 00:26:38.291
<v Speaker 1>him like directly and he show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just stands right in front of it and </v>

631
00:26:38.291 --> 00:26:39.650
<v Speaker 1>leans down on one knee right in front of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the camera.</v>

632
00:26:39.651 --> 00:26:44.651
<v Speaker 1>So if you look at the video of you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>find the video anywhere like gets just </v>

633
00:26:44.651 --> 00:26:44.651
<v Speaker 1>Alex</v>

634
00:26:44.651 --> 00:26:47.550
<v Speaker 4>and then this big head like blocking his</v>
<v Speaker 4>view.</v>

635
00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:50.280
<v Speaker 4>And then it's the cameraman all </v>
<v Speaker 4>scrambling for new shots.</v>

636
00:26:50.281 --> 00:26:53.430
<v Speaker 4>And it's all like Joey Diaz,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his head covering everyone's faces.</v>

637
00:26:53.660 --> 00:26:56.280
<v Speaker 4>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's a fucking national treasure man.</v>

638
00:26:56.530 --> 00:27:01.530
<v Speaker 4>You realize moments like this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I'm giving it no justice here </v>

639
00:27:01.530 --> 00:27:02.250
<v Speaker 4>describing and I'm trying to describe it</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

640
00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:04.920
<v Speaker 4>You got to see it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're going to have it up in a video and</v>

641
00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:06.600
<v Speaker 4>it's available online.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can see the whole thing,</v>

642
00:27:06.601 --> 00:27:07.680
<v Speaker 4>but we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're going to edit it,</v>

643
00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:10.980
<v Speaker 4>put together the right parts in a whole </v>
<v Speaker 4>video of the whole Austin trip.</v>

644
00:27:10.981 --> 00:27:14.250
<v Speaker 4>Because Austin was and always is the </v>
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>

645
00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:17.280
<v Speaker 4>Every time I go there to film,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it seems like magic happens.</v>

646
00:27:17.281 --> 00:27:22.281
<v Speaker 4>That is one of the best cities in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking state or one of the best cities </v>

647
00:27:22.281 --> 00:27:22.281
<v Speaker 4>in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

648
00:27:22.281 --> 00:27:24.470
<v Speaker 4>It really is because it's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

649
00:27:24.510 --> 00:27:26.160
<v Speaker 4>it is one of the best cities in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>state.</v>

650
00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:31.310
<v Speaker 4>It's also one of the best cities in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>country and if this is the best country </v>

651
00:27:31.310 --> 00:27:31.320
<v Speaker 4>in the world that that's one of the best</v>
<v Speaker 4>countries or cities in the world.</v>

652
00:27:31.321 --> 00:27:36.321
<v Speaker 4>I just fucked that whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not only is the food amazing everywhere </v>

653
00:27:36.321 --> 00:27:38.310
<v Speaker 4>you go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the food is fucking amazing.</v>

654
00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:43.580
<v Speaker 4>Everywhere you go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The women are beautiful and awesome and </v>

655
00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:46.290
<v Speaker 4>nice and loved a man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a friendly place.</v>

656
00:27:46.291 --> 00:27:48.000
<v Speaker 4>There's a few spots like that on this </v>
<v Speaker 4>country,</v>

657
00:27:48.001 --> 00:27:49.500
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where people are friendlier.</v>

658
00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:51.510
<v Speaker 4>That's one of the best ones.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Austin,</v>

659
00:27:51.511 --> 00:27:54.060
<v Speaker 4>Texas is one of the best ones.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fucking great music,</v>

660
00:27:54.061 --> 00:27:56.460
<v Speaker 4>but the smartest ones too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

661
00:27:56.760 --> 00:27:57.960
<v Speaker 4>just so many smart,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cool,</v>

662
00:27:57.961 --> 00:27:59.500
<v Speaker 4>interesting people there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just a.</v>

663
00:27:59.570 --> 00:28:02.760
<v Speaker 4>it's a fun fucking place to do worse </v>
<v Speaker 4>highways ever.</v>

664
00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:08.040
<v Speaker 4>The GPS just tweaks when it tries to </v>
<v Speaker 4>find the exit.</v>

665
00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:11.070
<v Speaker 4>For some reason they decided instead of </v>
<v Speaker 4>make their highways wider,</v>

666
00:28:11.071 --> 00:28:13.170
<v Speaker 4>they decide to stack them on top of each</v>
<v Speaker 4>other,</v>

667
00:28:13.570 --> 00:28:17.820
<v Speaker 4>so the logic behind it is so strange and</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you make me miss an exit,</v>

668
00:28:17.821 --> 00:28:19.010
<v Speaker 4>it's so impossible.</v>

669
00:28:19.020 --> 00:28:21.210
<v Speaker 4>Yet the roundabout it you're fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're fucked.</v>

670
00:28:21.211 --> 00:28:24.470
<v Speaker 4>Because almost every exit becomes a new </v>
<v Speaker 4>highway in another direction,</v>

671
00:28:24.471 --> 00:28:24.690
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

672
00:28:24.691 --> 00:28:26.940
<v Speaker 4>where's this one going?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Steph?</v>

673
00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:28.470
<v Speaker 4>It's death if you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you miss,</v>

674
00:28:28.530 --> 00:28:29.820
<v Speaker 4>if you miss a spot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're fucked.</v>

675
00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:32.610
<v Speaker 4>But other than that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the shit.</v>

676
00:28:33.890 --> 00:28:38.490
<v Speaker 4>Jessica Alba was here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The first clip that we got those classic</v>

677
00:28:38.491 --> 00:28:41.570
<v Speaker 4>from Austin was the clam thing with </v>
<v Speaker 4>Arctic plant.</v>

678
00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:44.350
<v Speaker 4>They painted that whole green room to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We did that.</v>

679
00:28:44.750 --> 00:28:46.890
<v Speaker 4>That was sad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The these,</v>

680
00:28:46.891 --> 00:28:51.891
<v Speaker 4>the green room in the Austin Cap city </v>
<v Speaker 4>comedy club used to be covered with </v>

681
00:28:51.891 --> 00:28:54.180
<v Speaker 4>graffiti and now it's just all painted </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it was like famous comics.</v>

682
00:28:54.390 --> 00:28:59.390
<v Speaker 4>Some comics are dead.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think Mitch Hedberg was on there and </v>

683
00:28:59.390 --> 00:29:00.690
<v Speaker 4>stuff and they decided to paint this </v>
<v Speaker 4>green over it.</v>

684
00:29:00.691 --> 00:29:01.540
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I asked him,</v>

685
00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:03.150
<v Speaker 4>what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Burger King buy you guys out.</v>

686
00:29:03.170 --> 00:29:03.960
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck yeah.</v>

687
00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:05.970
<v Speaker 4>It felt like a Kia or something like </v>
<v Speaker 4>the.</v>

688
00:29:06.030 --> 00:29:07.210
<v Speaker 4>Why would they do that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

689
00:29:07.230 --> 00:29:08.840
<v Speaker 4>That was the biggest fail ever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They should.</v>

690
00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:11.160
<v Speaker 4>Somebody should take a picture of that </v>
<v Speaker 4>green room and just call it fail.</v>

691
00:29:11.190 --> 00:29:16.190
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>someone should do is find photos of it </v>

692
00:29:16.190 --> 00:29:16.350
<v Speaker 4>all online and make wallpaper.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Glue it back on.</v>

693
00:29:17.090 --> 00:29:18.480
<v Speaker 4>I took,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've taken.</v>

694
00:29:18.481 --> 00:29:23.481
<v Speaker 4>Most of them you should do is enlarge </v>
<v Speaker 4>everything up high resolution like with </v>

695
00:29:23.481 --> 00:29:27.010
<v Speaker 4>some fucking Gene Hackman movie type </v>
<v Speaker 4>technology where they can take a big </v>

696
00:29:27.010 --> 00:29:30.381
<v Speaker 4>picture and actually make it look good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe we'll wait until it's LCD </v>

697
00:29:30.381 --> 00:29:32.870
<v Speaker 4>wallpaper and I'll just email them if a </v>
<v Speaker 4>bitch.</v>

698
00:29:33.150 --> 00:29:33.990
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How could they do that?</v>

699
00:29:33.991 --> 00:29:38.991
<v Speaker 4>Man?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was that place in the Atlanta </v>

700
00:29:38.991 --> 00:29:38.991
<v Speaker 4>punchline.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's another one.</v>

701
00:29:38.991 --> 00:29:39.150
<v Speaker 4>The Atlanta punchline to green rooms </v>
<v Speaker 4>just covered with.</v>

702
00:29:39.870 --> 00:29:42.340
<v Speaker 4>One of my favorite ones is trying to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>Hicks.</v>

703
00:29:42.970 --> 00:29:46.630
<v Speaker 4>Somebody had that as their avatar photo </v>
<v Speaker 4>on the Rogan board for Awhile.</v>

704
00:29:46.690 --> 00:29:51.690
<v Speaker 4>The best one was in Austin when it was </v>
<v Speaker 4>always my favorite and that's the one </v>

705
00:29:51.690 --> 00:29:52.600
<v Speaker 4>thing I always think it's that pee on </v>
<v Speaker 4>the toilet seat.</v>

706
00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:54.820
<v Speaker 4>Maybe we'll keep women out of comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

707
00:29:54.821 --> 00:29:58.750
<v Speaker 4>keep the toilet seat up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe we'll keep women at a kind of take</v>

708
00:29:58.760 --> 00:30:03.760
<v Speaker 4>my own life and I'm not a person that </v>
<v Speaker 4>lifts might the toilet seat nps.</v>

709
00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:10.140
<v Speaker 4>I'm one of the Ip through it because I </v>
<v Speaker 4>grew up with my mom and my sister and I </v>

710
00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:14.431
<v Speaker 4>just use.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just wash it every time he piss all </v>

711
00:30:14.431 --> 00:30:15.640
<v Speaker 4>over the toilet seat and know my aim is </v>
<v Speaker 4>amazing,</v>

712
00:30:15.641 --> 00:30:18.010
<v Speaker 4>but once in a while you'll get that one </v>
<v Speaker 4>little teeny drop.</v>

713
00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:20.060
<v Speaker 4>So it's a once in a while.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Someone has to sit in your peers?</v>

714
00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:20.820
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because then I clean.</v>

715
00:30:20.860 --> 00:30:23.530
<v Speaker 4>I always clean it with water and toilet </v>
<v Speaker 4>paper.</v>

716
00:30:24.180 --> 00:30:27.040
<v Speaker 4>What about soap?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Was that enough?</v>

717
00:30:27.250 --> 00:30:30.380
<v Speaker 4>If someone pissed on your fork and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>cleaned it with water and Toilet Paper,</v>

718
00:30:31.470 --> 00:30:32.770
<v Speaker 4>you drink pee?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't.</v>

719
00:30:32.780 --> 00:30:35.060
<v Speaker 4>I don't think I'd have to worry about </v>
<v Speaker 4>your little buddy.</v>

720
00:30:37.250 --> 00:30:39.780
<v Speaker 4>I don't say it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do it every day and it's not mine.</v>

721
00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:41.650
<v Speaker 4>It's his big difference between if I </v>
<v Speaker 4>said,</v>

722
00:30:41.651 --> 00:30:44.350
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I drank p for a stunt on a radio show</v>

723
00:30:44.351 --> 00:30:46.390
<v Speaker 4>or if I piss in your mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These are two.</v>

724
00:30:46.391 --> 00:30:47.590
<v Speaker 4>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like the old thing,</v>

725
00:30:47.591 --> 00:30:52.591
<v Speaker 4>like we just always talk about your </v>
<v Speaker 4>stand wiping up or do you sit down and </v>

726
00:30:52.591 --> 00:30:53.980
<v Speaker 4>go through the legs?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Me and Joe are both standards.</v>

727
00:30:53.981 --> 00:30:58.510
<v Speaker 4>Are you a standard wipe and then I </v>
<v Speaker 4>jumped in the shower.</v>

728
00:30:58.511 --> 00:31:00.550
<v Speaker 4>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just wiped warm shower every time.</v>

729
00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:01.720
<v Speaker 4>Every time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

730
00:31:01.721 --> 00:31:03.310
<v Speaker 4>What if your shower?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Every time he shit,</v>

731
00:31:03.340 --> 00:31:06.570
<v Speaker 4>unless I'm like at a public restroom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but my shift consistent.</v>

732
00:31:06.730 --> 00:31:08.650
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In the morning when I wake up,</v>

733
00:31:08.690 --> 00:31:10.300
<v Speaker 4>10:00,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm ready to go.</v>

734
00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:15.360

736
00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:20.720

<v Speaker 4>your asshole then shoots water at your </v>

737
00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:25.171
<v Speaker 4>asshole at the same temperature of your </v>
<v Speaker 4>skin and then it comes out with another </v>

738
00:31:25.171 --> 00:31:25.990
<v Speaker 4>laser that shoots and finds the </v>
<v Speaker 4>hairdryer and it dries your asshole?</v>

<v Speaker 4>technology that has not changed since I </v>

00:31:49.141 --> 00:31:50.170
<v Speaker 4>was a kid.</v>

<v Speaker 4>No one's gonna buy them.</v>

753
00:31:57.460 --> 00:31:59.230

<v Speaker 4>I would buy 300 bucks.</v>

<v Speaker 4>you.</v>

774
00:32:48.290 --> 00:32:53.290
<v Speaker 4>Are you shitting and talking to me?</v>

<v Speaker 4>on the toilet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They'll have like a jawbone of a second </v>

<v Speaker 4>what is it with all these black people </v>
<v Speaker 4>that like to talk on speakerphone just </v>

845
00:35:42.321 --> 00:35:44.040
<v Speaker 4>because you're black and if you're doing</v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

846
00:35:44.041 --> 00:35:45.870
<v Speaker 4>I'm not dickish.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just observing.</v>

847
00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:51.020
<v Speaker 4>What is that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a weird thing that I don't see </v>

848
00:35:51.020 --> 00:35:53.211
<v Speaker 4>that many white people do them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I see a lot of black people doing </v>

849
00:35:53.211 --> 00:35:53.211
<v Speaker 4>and it's not a negative thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what?</v>

850
00:35:53.211 --> 00:35:54.570
<v Speaker 4>He does a lot of fucking douchey things </v>
<v Speaker 4>that white people do too.</v>

851
00:35:54.571 --> 00:35:57.600
<v Speaker 4>But I'm not being racist here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm observing something.</v>

852
00:35:57.780 --> 00:36:02.780
<v Speaker 4>Are you saying that I'm not allowed to </v>
<v Speaker 4>observe because you share the same </v>

853
00:36:02.780 --> 00:36:05.811
<v Speaker 4>melanin content is this person I'm </v>
<v Speaker 4>observing and even though you're not </v>

854
00:36:05.811 --> 00:36:05.811
<v Speaker 4>even doing the same thing that they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing,</v>

855
00:36:05.811 --> 00:36:10.460
<v Speaker 4>that's fucking ridiculous that we're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're real close with racism in this </v>

856
00:36:10.460 --> 00:36:10.770
<v Speaker 4>country,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

857
00:36:10.770 --> 00:36:13.560
<v Speaker 4>We're real close to being ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is ridiculous.</v>

858
00:36:13.561 --> 00:36:15.200
<v Speaker 4>The whole thing is ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

859
00:36:15.201 --> 00:36:17.670
<v Speaker 4>like with especially like the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

860
00:36:17.910 --> 00:36:21.990
<v Speaker 4>anger between feeling like you have to </v>
<v Speaker 4>fight somebody because of their race.</v>

861
00:36:21.991 --> 00:36:26.991
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like there's people like beating up </v>

862
00:36:26.991 --> 00:36:27.110
<v Speaker 4>different races just because of what </v>
<v Speaker 4>race does that mean?</v>

863
00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:28.290
<v Speaker 4>That's legit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Racism,</v>

864
00:36:28.291 --> 00:36:33.291
<v Speaker 4>but I'm talking about is the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm talking about people looking to </v>

865
00:36:33.291 --> 00:36:35.640
<v Speaker 4>point the finger at racism when you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>really just acknowledging something.</v>

866
00:36:35.641 --> 00:36:37.770
<v Speaker 4>That's a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just seeing something.</v>

867
00:36:37.771 --> 00:36:38.800
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>

868
00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:40.920
<v Speaker 4>The fact that I said that they happen to</v>
<v Speaker 4>be black.</v>

869
00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:41.490
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

870
00:36:41.491 --> 00:36:43.600
<v Speaker 4>so does going to be black.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So why do they do this black?</v>

871
00:36:43.660 --> 00:36:45.090
<v Speaker 4>Why do these brothers be doing that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or No,</v>

872
00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:47.250
<v Speaker 4>they just do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know why to do it.</v>

873
00:36:47.251 --> 00:36:48.560
<v Speaker 4>But you didn't get an answer?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

874
00:36:48.570 --> 00:36:49.830
<v Speaker 4>No one has an answer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

875
00:36:49.831 --> 00:36:51.810
<v Speaker 4>but most people were saying their </v>
<v Speaker 4>attention whores,</v>

876
00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:53.280
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's what,</v>

877
00:36:54.060 --> 00:36:59.060
<v Speaker 4>I guess one of the reasons why people </v>
<v Speaker 4>were getting mad at me as I was saying </v>

878
00:36:59.060 --> 00:36:59.060
<v Speaker 4>that black people were attending.</v>

879
00:36:59.060 --> 00:37:02.460
<v Speaker 4>So which is not what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm saying I see a lot of black people </v>

880
00:37:02.460 --> 00:37:04.080
<v Speaker 4>that like to talk on speakerphone when </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're by themselves.</v>

881
00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:06.600
<v Speaker 4>I don't see why people doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't mean they're not doing it,</v>

882
00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:09.990
<v Speaker 4>but I'm asking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's something I see and might not allow</v>

883
00:37:09.991 --> 00:37:11.820
<v Speaker 4>it to see things because people are </v>
<v Speaker 4>black.</v>

884
00:37:12.030 --> 00:37:14.130
<v Speaker 4>Like that's a tricky fucking road to </v>
<v Speaker 4>walk down.</v>

885
00:37:14.131 --> 00:37:15.270
<v Speaker 4>That's nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what?</v>

886
00:37:15.271 --> 00:37:20.271
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it's because they don't want to </v>
<v Speaker 4>get brain cancer and they're just more </v>

887
00:37:20.271 --> 00:37:21.060
<v Speaker 4>concerned about it than white people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dude,</v>

888
00:37:21.210 --> 00:37:24.030
<v Speaker 4>I know somebody that does that though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know somebody that only talks to using</v>

889
00:37:24.031 --> 00:37:25.860
<v Speaker 4>the speakerphone function for some </v>
<v Speaker 4>reason.</v>

890
00:37:25.950 --> 00:37:27.180
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but not in public.</v>

891
00:37:27.181 --> 00:37:28.770
<v Speaker 4>Outside.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They do it.</v>

892
00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:30.470
<v Speaker 4>They do it at olive garden.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>

<v Speaker 4>Why does she do that?</v>

896
00:37:40.620 --> 00:37:42.000
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have no idea.</v>

898
00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:47.320
<v Speaker 4>between her and her parents too because </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's fair.</v>

899
00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:52.040
<v Speaker 4>Her parents are so ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but she's just really weird with her </v>

900
00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:52.040
<v Speaker 4>phone and phone calls.</v>

905
00:38:01.700 --> 00:38:05.640
<v Speaker 4>there was a white girl at the airport </v>
<v Speaker 4>who's talking her ass off,</v>

906
00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:10.700
<v Speaker 4>like just really fucking loud waiting to</v>
<v Speaker 4>get on a plane and it was kind of </v>

907
00:38:10.700 --> 00:38:11.280
<v Speaker 4>annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's fucking annoying as shit,</v>

908
00:38:11.281 --> 00:38:12.870
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can have a normal conversation.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Just put that fucking thing up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you usually cover?</v>

910
00:38:15.190 --> 00:38:18.280

911
00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:20.130

<v Speaker 4>sitting there going,</v>

00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:27.960
<v Speaker 4>And then the other person,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the other,</v>

920
00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:30.410
<v Speaker 4>we're going to come down there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

921
00:38:31.300 --> 00:38:33.840
<v Speaker 4>I have to listen to your shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

922
00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:36.520
<v Speaker 4>This is loud.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe she just does it around me now.</v>

923
00:38:36.521 --> 00:38:39.850
<v Speaker 4>I'm kind of paranoid that I said because</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

924
00:38:39.851 --> 00:38:41.230
<v Speaker 4>wait,</v>

925
00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:43.300
<v Speaker 4>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if she only does.</v>

926
00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:48.420
<v Speaker 4>She does it around me a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it's a security thing where she </v>

927
00:38:48.420 --> 00:38:48.420
<v Speaker 4>wants to do like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I'm not hiding this around.</v>

930
00:38:51.310 --> 00:38:55.990

931
00:38:56.020 --> 00:38:57.370
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I should start doing it around here.</v>

933
00:38:59.950 --> 00:39:02.170

<v Speaker 4>way.</v>

934
00:39:02.350 --> 00:39:07.350
<v Speaker 4>We've got a tricky thing in this world </v>
<v Speaker 4>about people being too fucking </v>

00:39:07.350 --> 00:39:07.350
<v Speaker 4>sensitive.</v>

939
00:39:16.871 --> 00:39:18.900
<v Speaker 4>of controversy because she shook a </v>
<v Speaker 4>dude's hand.</v>

956
00:40:03.461 --> 00:40:08.461

<v Speaker 1>So like the other day I was watching </v>
<v Speaker 1>ancient aliens.</v>

1119
00:46:50.881 --> 00:46:55.870
<v Speaker 1>I spent like a whole hour just tweeting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking shit on h and aliens that gather</v>

1120
00:46:55.920 --> 00:46:57.900
<v Speaker 1>new season.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So bad.</v>

1121
00:46:57.990 --> 00:46:59.400
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first season was incredible.</v>

1122
00:46:59.401 --> 00:47:01.360
<v Speaker 1>The first season is awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They ran out of.</v>

1123
00:47:02.220 --> 00:47:04.290
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1124
00:47:04.470 --> 00:47:05.760
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was crazy.</v>

1125
00:47:05.761 --> 00:47:09.060
<v Speaker 1>All the shit that we're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you look at it this way,</v>

1126
00:47:09.090 --> 00:47:11.410
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't believe in Ufos,</v>

1127
00:47:11.610 --> 00:47:15.510
<v Speaker 1>then that sounds ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you do believe,</v>

1128
00:47:15.511 --> 00:47:19.380
<v Speaker 1>if you watched the disclosure project </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you listen to all the courses,</v>

1129
00:47:19.620 --> 00:47:21.950
<v Speaker 1>testimony,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy who used to work for the.</v>

1130
00:47:22.050 --> 00:47:25.080
<v Speaker 1>We used to be in the Pentagon and </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking head of nuclear energy in Europe</v>

1131
00:47:25.081 --> 00:47:28.080
<v Speaker 1>and all that shit when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you hear his confessions and like,</v>

1132
00:47:28.110 --> 00:47:30.160
<v Speaker 1>like the deathbed confession of General </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ramy</v>

1133
00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:31.410
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and just if you,</v>

1134
00:47:31.690 --> 00:47:36.690
<v Speaker 5>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you believe in Ufos than fucking </v>

1135
00:47:36.690 --> 00:47:38.380
<v Speaker 5>anything as possible,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then that means they must have been here</v>

1136
00:47:39.010 --> 00:47:44.010
<v Speaker 5>several times at least.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And if there were around during the </v>

1137
00:47:44.010 --> 00:47:44.050
<v Speaker 5>Greek time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they must have tripped out on them.</v>

1138
00:47:44.110 --> 00:47:47.200
<v Speaker 5>That must've been a big news like these </v>
<v Speaker 5>motherfuckers.</v>

1139
00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:50.710
<v Speaker 5>And they must have like talked to drew </v>
<v Speaker 5>about,</v>

1140
00:47:51.010 --> 00:47:51.530
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1141
00:47:51.780 --> 00:47:52.260
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1142
00:47:52.330 --> 00:47:54.100
<v Speaker 5>painted about it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>talked about it,</v>

1143
00:47:54.310 --> 00:47:58.660
<v Speaker 5>wrote some scripture about or something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's not that far fetched,</v>

1144
00:47:58.661 --> 00:48:02.020
<v Speaker 5>but that come into some like ridiculous </v>
<v Speaker 5>conclusions like about,</v>

1145
00:48:02.440 --> 00:48:06.190
<v Speaker 5>like the paintings in India that maybe </v>
<v Speaker 5>this was an alien,</v>

1146
00:48:06.260 --> 00:48:09.460
<v Speaker 5>will the Mahabharata the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a fascinating text.</v>

1147
00:48:09.461 --> 00:48:12.480
<v Speaker 5>The ancient texts of ancient hinduism is</v>
<v Speaker 5>a,</v>

1148
00:48:12.530 --> 00:48:15.530
<v Speaker 5>is riddled with stories of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of flying things and,</v>

1149
00:48:15.730 --> 00:48:18.820
<v Speaker 5>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>things that flew through the air.</v>

1150
00:48:18.970 --> 00:48:22.210
<v Speaker 5>But you also have to realize that these </v>
<v Speaker 5>people took a lot of drugs.</v>

1151
00:48:22.450 --> 00:48:24.670
<v Speaker 5>These people were in the heavy </v>
<v Speaker 5>psychedelic drugs.</v>

1152
00:48:24.870 --> 00:48:29.870
<v Speaker 5>I mean Mana to the ancient Hindu tax.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They believe it's some sort of a </v>

1153
00:48:29.870 --> 00:48:32.790
<v Speaker 5>combination of psilocybin mushrooms and </v>
<v Speaker 5>a bunch of other different things.</v>

1154
00:48:32.791 --> 00:48:34.810
<v Speaker 5>There's a bunch of debate about what </v>
<v Speaker 5>Mana is,</v>

1155
00:48:34.990 --> 00:48:39.990
<v Speaker 5>but it's very clear that they were </v>
<v Speaker 5>referencing something that connected </v>

1156
00:48:39.990 --> 00:48:43.801
<v Speaker 5>them to the psychedelic world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And if it was something that connected </v>

1157
00:48:43.801 --> 00:48:44.140
<v Speaker 5>them to the psychedelic world,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1158
00:48:44.141 --> 00:48:46.480
<v Speaker 5>and I know you're going to see some </v>
<v Speaker 5>shit.</v>

1159
00:48:46.720 --> 00:48:49.000
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't mean that the shit you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>seeing is not real.</v>

1160
00:48:49.100 --> 00:48:50.360
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you see the,</v>

1161
00:48:50.370 --> 00:48:52.150
<v Speaker 5>like when people think of </v>
<v Speaker 5>hallucinations,</v>

1162
00:48:52.390 --> 00:48:57.390
<v Speaker 5>like you think of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh you took a drug and you saw a monkey </v>

1163
00:48:57.390 --> 00:48:57.390
<v Speaker 5>that wasn't really there and he,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1164
00:48:57.390 --> 00:48:58.930
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you think of something fake,</v>

1165
00:48:59.320 --> 00:49:04.320
<v Speaker 5>but what you see a lot of times when you</v>
<v Speaker 5>take psychedelics drugs is not like the </v>

1166
00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:05.290
<v Speaker 5>rest of the world.</v>

1167
00:49:05.290 --> 00:49:07.690
<v Speaker 5>And then all of a sudden some new fake </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing shows up.</v>

1168
00:49:07.900 --> 00:49:12.900
<v Speaker 5>It shows you like a whole new world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It shows you like a whole hallucination </v>

1169
00:49:13.061 --> 00:49:16.510
<v Speaker 5>world which may or may not be real.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1170
00:49:16.511 --> 00:49:17.130
<v Speaker 5>what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what,</v>

1171
00:49:17.220 --> 00:49:22.220
<v Speaker 5>what might be happening when you take </v>
<v Speaker 5>like big doses of any crazy drug as you </v>

1172
00:49:22.220 --> 00:49:23.980
<v Speaker 5>might be tuning into the next door </v>
<v Speaker 5>neighbor channel.</v>

1173
00:49:24.190 --> 00:49:25.450
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there might be the whole world,</v>

1174
00:49:25.451 --> 00:49:28.270
<v Speaker 5>might be a fucking radio,</v>
<v Speaker 5>have a million different channels and we</v>

1175
00:49:28.271 --> 00:49:29.540
<v Speaker 5>might be on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1176
00:49:29.620 --> 00:49:31.150
<v Speaker 5>1:06</v>
<v Speaker 5>point four.</v>

1177
00:49:31.210 --> 00:49:33.670
<v Speaker 5>And there's a 100,</v>
<v Speaker 5>six point five and it's right next door.</v>

1178
00:49:33.671 --> 00:49:35.260
<v Speaker 5>And when you take mushrooms you go </v>
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>

1179
00:49:35.530 --> 00:49:36.760
<v Speaker 5>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you know,</v>

1180
00:49:36.970 --> 00:49:41.970
<v Speaker 5>these guys saying that they saw these </v>
<v Speaker 5>flying things and talking about all </v>

1181
00:49:41.970 --> 00:49:45.931
<v Speaker 5>these majestic beings with all this </v>
<v Speaker 5>wisdom that very easily could have been </v>

1182
00:49:46.121 --> 00:49:48.130
<v Speaker 5>drugs very easily.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It could be.</v>

1183
00:49:48.131 --> 00:49:49.300
<v Speaker 5>That could,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it could be both.</v>

1184
00:49:49.360 --> 00:49:54.360
<v Speaker 5>I mean just because you have a </v>
<v Speaker 5>psychedelic experience doesn't mean </v>

1185
00:49:54.360 --> 00:49:54.940
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean that very,</v>

1186
00:49:55.210 --> 00:50:00.210
<v Speaker 5>very.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know how much I believe very </v>

1187
00:50:00.210 --> 00:50:03.850
<v Speaker 5>skeptical about crafts from another </v>
<v Speaker 5>planet that come here that are metal and</v>

1188
00:50:04.120 --> 00:50:06.580
<v Speaker 5>the traditional idea of like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1189
00:50:06.790 --> 00:50:09.460
<v Speaker 5>just doing a super advanced version of </v>
<v Speaker 5>what we already do.</v>

1190
00:50:09.790 --> 00:50:12.100
<v Speaker 5>I look at that and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think so.</v>

1191
00:50:12.130 --> 00:50:14.700
<v Speaker 5>This just seems too silly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It seems to.</v>

1192
00:50:14.770 --> 00:50:16.700
<v Speaker 5>Mechanic testimony did.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1193
00:50:16.701 --> 00:50:18.070
<v Speaker 5>But it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a lot of testimony.</v>

1194
00:50:18.071 --> 00:50:23.071
<v Speaker 5>People being raped by demons.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can go back in time and find </v>

1195
00:50:23.071 --> 00:50:23.890
<v Speaker 5>thousands of Napa who.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it's not your size.</v>

1196
00:50:23.891 --> 00:50:28.891
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But these people which try and keep on </v>

1197
00:50:28.891 --> 00:50:30.290
<v Speaker 5>organizing and getting in front of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>Washington DC and the national press and</v>

1198
00:50:30.291 --> 00:50:33.540
<v Speaker 5>they don't have credible witness like </v>
<v Speaker 5>hundreds of them and Philip course.</v>

1199
00:50:33.550 --> 00:50:36.500
<v Speaker 5>So on all these guys that like in their </v>
<v Speaker 5>death bed,</v>

1200
00:50:36.710 --> 00:50:39.290
<v Speaker 5>like you watched the testimonies like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do you think these guys are lying?</v>

1201
00:50:41.180 --> 00:50:46.180
<v Speaker 5>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it doesn't necessarily mean that </v>

1202
00:50:46.180 --> 00:50:46.180
<v Speaker 5>they are telling the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It might mean they're wrong.</v>

1203
00:50:46.180 --> 00:50:47.900
<v Speaker 5>It might mean that there's some crazy </v>
<v Speaker 5>government experiments that they don't.</v>

1204
00:50:47.930 --> 00:50:49.280
<v Speaker 5>They're not really sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I believe in that.</v>

1205
00:50:49.281 --> 00:50:52.490
<v Speaker 5>I believe there's definitely a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 5>this shit.</v>

1206
00:50:52.520 --> 00:50:55.870
<v Speaker 5>Maybe most of the shit that people see </v>
<v Speaker 5>and report our,</v>

1207
00:50:55.900 --> 00:51:00.900
<v Speaker 5>our own government make and shape.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But if you listen to Philip Corso </v>

1208
00:51:00.900 --> 00:51:00.900
<v Speaker 5>testimony,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's saying yes.</v>

1209
00:51:00.900 --> 00:51:05.710
<v Speaker 5>A lot of that shit is our shit to say </v>
<v Speaker 5>that he saw things himself personally.</v>

1210
00:51:06.200 --> 00:51:06.800
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he did.</v>

1211
00:51:07.220 --> 00:51:08.020
<v Speaker 5>Phil,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of course.</v>

1212
00:51:08.060 --> 00:51:12.020
<v Speaker 5>So was this part of Roswell right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>He wasn't at Roswell,</v>

1213
00:51:12.021 --> 00:51:14.270
<v Speaker 5>but he was involved in the shipping and </v>
<v Speaker 5>stuff.</v>

1214
00:51:14.271 --> 00:51:19.271
<v Speaker 5>He said he saw the bodies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He said that he was intrinsically saw </v>

1215
00:51:19.271 --> 00:51:20.570
<v Speaker 5>them or saw them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He saw that.</v>

1216
00:51:20.960 --> 00:51:22.760
<v Speaker 5>He said he opened the coffin song and </v>
<v Speaker 5>said,</v>

1217
00:51:22.761 --> 00:51:24.500
<v Speaker 5>Oh shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And He.</v>

1218
00:51:24.590 --> 00:51:29.590
<v Speaker 5>He knew so much that he was in charge of</v>
<v Speaker 5>taking crashed Ufo shit and taking it </v>

1219
00:51:31.191 --> 00:51:32.150
<v Speaker 5>to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is what he said,</v>

1220
00:51:32.390 --> 00:51:37.390
<v Speaker 5>taking it to like Hughes aircraft and </v>
<v Speaker 5>Mcdonald Douglas getting reverse </v>

1221
00:51:37.390 --> 00:51:37.390
<v Speaker 5>engineer.</v>

1222
00:51:37.390 --> 00:51:41.450
<v Speaker 5>Fascinating story about Roswell and </v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody thinks at Roswell's a silly </v>

1223
00:51:41.450 --> 00:51:42.980
<v Speaker 5>stupid story and no one knows exactly </v>
<v Speaker 5>what happened.</v>

1224
00:51:42.981 --> 00:51:45.530
<v Speaker 5>It could have been some sort of a Soviet</v>
<v Speaker 5>craft that crashed,</v>

1225
00:51:45.950 --> 00:51:50.950
<v Speaker 5>but the fascinating part is that they </v>
<v Speaker 5>flew the wreckage and two separate </v>

1226
00:51:50.950 --> 00:51:52.970
<v Speaker 5>planes because they wanted to make sure </v>
<v Speaker 5>of one plane crash.</v>

1227
00:51:53.210 --> 00:51:58.210
<v Speaker 5>They had a good chance that the other </v>
<v Speaker 5>plane would make it to Wright Patterson </v>

1228
00:51:58.210 --> 00:51:59.660
<v Speaker 5>air force base and they made sure they </v>
<v Speaker 5>separated the wreckage.</v>

1229
00:51:59.720 --> 00:52:04.210
<v Speaker 5>There's just so much evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Even like today with like the chain,</v>

1230
00:52:04.240 --> 00:52:09.240
<v Speaker 5>the China Shanghai airport or an airport</v>
<v Speaker 5>in China closed down twice within a few </v>

1231
00:52:10.610 --> 00:52:12.770
<v Speaker 5>months because there were some shit </v>
<v Speaker 5>right over the airport.</v>

1232
00:52:12.800 --> 00:52:14.660
<v Speaker 5>They didn't know what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They shut everything down.</v>

1233
00:52:14.810 --> 00:52:17.420
<v Speaker 5>I mean just shit like that all over the </v>
<v Speaker 5>world.</v>

1234
00:52:17.421 --> 00:52:19.370
<v Speaker 5>I mean there's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So there's actually is evidence.</v>

1235
00:52:19.371 --> 00:52:22.070
<v Speaker 5>I mean people are put away for life with</v>
<v Speaker 5>no video,</v>

1236
00:52:22.071 --> 00:52:23.330
<v Speaker 5>no pictures of the crime.</v>

1237
00:52:23.480 --> 00:52:25.460
<v Speaker 5>Just testimony,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

1238
00:52:25.461 --> 00:52:30.461
<v Speaker 5>they're just listening to that testimony</v>
<v Speaker 5>and putting people away for multiple </v>

1239
00:52:30.461 --> 00:52:32.270
<v Speaker 5>life sentences.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When you put all the evidence together,</v>

1240
00:52:32.271 --> 00:52:34.960
<v Speaker 5>just look up Phillip Corso with the sea.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What?</v>

1241
00:52:35.030 --> 00:52:37.270
<v Speaker 5>There's hours and hours of him just </v>
<v Speaker 5>talking about.</v>

1242
00:52:37.290 --> 00:52:40.250
<v Speaker 5>He wrote a book about it before he was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was an old motherfucker.</v>

1243
00:52:40.280 --> 00:52:45.280
<v Speaker 5>He was on dateline and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think an even more compelling one is </v>

1244
00:52:45.280 --> 00:52:50.230
<v Speaker 5>Dr j Dot Allen Hynek exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Was Working on project Blue Book and he </v>

1245
00:52:50.601 --> 00:52:55.601
<v Speaker 5>was assigned to discredit ufo stories.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He what his job was as he explained it </v>

1246
00:52:56.991 --> 00:53:01.991
<v Speaker 5>was when he would hear about something,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he would come up with a reason that it </v>

1247
00:53:01.991 --> 00:53:01.991
<v Speaker 5>was something else.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Swamp,</v>

1248
00:53:01.991 --> 00:53:04.460
<v Speaker 5>swamp gas or circular ball,</v>
<v Speaker 5>lightning.</v>

1249
00:53:04.490 --> 00:53:06.470
<v Speaker 5>All this different.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She was hired for that by the government</v>

1250
00:53:06.471 --> 00:53:11.471
<v Speaker 5>like in the fifties and sixties.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then when project blue book shut </v>

1251
00:53:11.471 --> 00:53:14.501
<v Speaker 5>down,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he dedicated his entire life to </v>

1252
00:53:14.501 --> 00:53:14.600
<v Speaker 5>investigating you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fos and enlightening people on it.</v>

1253
00:53:14.780 --> 00:53:16.400
<v Speaker 5>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he talks about it.</v>

1254
00:53:16.401 --> 00:53:21.401
<v Speaker 5>I mean there's interviews,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's like ours and then there's like a </v>

1255
00:53:21.401 --> 00:53:24.041
<v Speaker 5>new theory.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now the new theory is that the </v>

1256
00:53:24.041 --> 00:53:26.490
<v Speaker 5>government wants everyone to believe in </v>
<v Speaker 5>Ufos.</v>

1257
00:53:26.760 --> 00:53:30.220
<v Speaker 2>To keep their projects under wrap,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they're black projects under wrap.</v>

1258
00:53:30.390 --> 00:53:31.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

1259
00:53:31.280 --> 00:53:36.280
<v Speaker 2>What is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was this project blue book and all </v>

1260
00:53:36.280 --> 00:53:36.280
<v Speaker 2>this stuff or whatever saying that it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was swamp gas number.</v>

1261
00:53:36.280 --> 00:53:38.370
<v Speaker 2>Trying to calm everybody down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why were they lying?</v>

1262
00:53:38.460 --> 00:53:39.930
<v Speaker 2>I mean they would have just said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1263
00:53:40.110 --> 00:53:42.390
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't know what it is.</v>

1264
00:53:42.480 --> 00:53:45.630
<v Speaker 2>It's probably from another galaxy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we don't know,</v>

1265
00:53:45.631 --> 00:53:48.360
<v Speaker 2>but what we assure you we're going to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever it takes to protect you.</v>

1266
00:53:48.480 --> 00:53:50.210
<v Speaker 2>If they really wanted people to believe </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>

1267
00:53:50.430 --> 00:53:51.990
<v Speaker 2>they'd be saying that shit not cover it </v>
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

1268
00:53:51.991 --> 00:53:56.070
<v Speaker 2>So I mean if you look up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at the Phillip Corso testimony.</v>

1269
00:53:56.350 --> 00:54:01.350
<v Speaker 2>Look at the disclosure project.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's already been at least two of </v>

1270
00:54:01.350 --> 00:54:01.350
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean these,</v>

1271
00:54:01.350 --> 00:54:05.810
<v Speaker 2>there's so much credible and like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the top scientists of Europe all </v>

1272
00:54:06.301 --> 00:54:08.520
<v Speaker 2>got together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forget what the committee is called.</v>

1273
00:54:08.660 --> 00:54:13.660
<v Speaker 2>International Group was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They came together in France and they </v>

1274
00:54:13.660 --> 00:54:17.571
<v Speaker 2>looked at all the Ufo testimony and all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the shit and they said 15 percent.</v>

1275
00:54:18.870 --> 00:54:23.870
<v Speaker 2>It's probably beans from another galaxy </v>
<v Speaker 2>or another solar system.</v>

1276
00:54:24.270 --> 00:54:29.270
<v Speaker 2>That's what they said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of them could have been explained </v>

1277
00:54:29.270 --> 00:54:29.270
<v Speaker 2>away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the 15 percent they said,</v>

1278
00:54:30.720 --> 00:54:35.720
<v Speaker 2>this is probably,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would not conclude that it was </v>

1279
00:54:35.720 --> 00:54:36.690
<v Speaker 2>something from this earth that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>haven't discovered yet.</v>

1280
00:54:36.840 --> 00:54:38.400
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially when you look at the ocean,</v>

1281
00:54:38.640 --> 00:54:42.030
<v Speaker 2>well this is what they concluded.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They concluded that all the other ship,</v>

1282
00:54:42.060 --> 00:54:45.240
<v Speaker 2>85 percent of all the shit that like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that could be me,</v>

1283
00:54:45.270 --> 00:54:46.890
<v Speaker 2>that could be manmade,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that could be this.</v>

1284
00:54:46.891 --> 00:54:49.230
<v Speaker 2>This is probably some reflection off the</v>
<v Speaker 2>sun.</v>

1285
00:54:49.590 --> 00:54:54.590
<v Speaker 2>Fifteen percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They said the most likely because based </v>

1286
00:54:54.590 --> 00:54:57.780
<v Speaker 2>on the pictures and the way that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>got some shit from satellite pictures of</v>

1287
00:54:58.110 --> 00:55:01.830
<v Speaker 2>craft coming from the top down that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't explain it and they're like,</v>

1288
00:55:01.920 --> 00:55:04.230
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck are moving?</v>

1289
00:55:04.880 --> 00:55:09.880
<v Speaker 2>You know that weird shit of things </v>
<v Speaker 2>moving and then changing angles and </v>

1290
00:55:09.880 --> 00:55:10.680
<v Speaker 2>changing direction and moving another </v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

1291
00:55:10.800 --> 00:55:14.200
<v Speaker 2>The big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bigger incident that happened at the</v>

1292
00:55:14.400 --> 00:55:19.400
<v Speaker 2>US military installation in the UK where</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's an 80 motherfuckers that saw </v>

1293
00:55:19.471 --> 00:55:24.471
<v Speaker 2>this aircraft,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three of them came up to it as it was </v>

1294
00:55:24.471 --> 00:55:24.471
<v Speaker 2>parked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They touched it.</v>

1295
00:55:24.471 --> 00:55:25.540
<v Speaker 2>They took notes that are on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>disclosure possibility.</v>

1296
00:55:25.620 --> 00:55:28.620
<v Speaker 2>Three of them went up to it and 80 of </v>
<v Speaker 2>them were all around going,</v>

1297
00:55:28.621 --> 00:55:31.140
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's possible that it was a drone.</v>

1298
00:55:31.680 --> 00:55:33.630
<v Speaker 2>That's possible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it was something from America.</v>

1299
00:55:34.110 --> 00:55:37.110
<v Speaker 2>When they set it to God disappeared.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was gone.</v>

1300
00:55:37.230 --> 00:55:38.730
<v Speaker 2>When I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you have a drone,</v>

1301
00:55:38.731 --> 00:55:43.731
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if we're talking about </v>

1302
00:55:43.731 --> 00:55:43.731
<v Speaker 2>different alternative sources of power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't know none of those.</v>

1303
00:55:43.731 --> 00:55:46.170
<v Speaker 2>None of those motherfuckers and and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>came back.</v>

1304
00:55:46.320 --> 00:55:51.320
<v Speaker 2>They sent a guy to look into it and that</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy's in the disclosure project to like </v>

1305
00:55:51.320 --> 00:55:55.611
<v Speaker 2>two days later they sent the guy to calm</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone down and they came back and </v>

1306
00:55:55.611 --> 00:55:57.750
<v Speaker 2>they saw it and these guys are the and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>

1307
00:55:58.110 --> 00:56:00.980
<v Speaker 2>When the military,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the UK embassy,</v>

1308
00:56:00.990 --> 00:56:02.670
<v Speaker 2>The d,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Ministry of Defense,</v>

1309
00:56:03.040 --> 00:56:05.670
<v Speaker 2>they're there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When the.</v>

1310
00:56:05.730 --> 00:56:07.710
<v Speaker 2>They came up to them and ask them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are we going to do about this?</v>

1311
00:56:07.711 --> 00:56:08.910
<v Speaker 2>What was that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They go,</v>

1312
00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:12.660
<v Speaker 2>this doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it doesn't concern national security,</v>

1313
00:56:12.720 --> 00:56:17.720
<v Speaker 2>we're not getting involved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't sucker and we feel that it </v>

1314
00:56:17.720 --> 00:56:17.970
<v Speaker 2>doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't.</v>

1315
00:56:18.470 --> 00:56:19.860
<v Speaker 2>But here's the problem with this whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>story.</v>

1316
00:56:19.861 --> 00:56:20.820
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You weren't there.</v>

1317
00:56:20.821 --> 00:56:25.821
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're just talking about what we heard </v>

1318
00:56:25.821 --> 00:56:25.821
<v Speaker 2>people talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't</v>

1319
00:56:25.821 --> 00:56:27.340
<v Speaker 5>know exactly what went down and until </v>
<v Speaker 5>you talk to these people,</v>

1320
00:56:27.341 --> 00:56:28.690
<v Speaker 5>you don't know how many of them are full</v>
<v Speaker 5>of shit.</v>

1321
00:56:28.691 --> 00:56:31.470
<v Speaker 5>How many of them are exaggerating,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how many of them were traumatized?</v>

1322
00:56:31.471 --> 00:56:33.820
<v Speaker 5>That's why I say based on the shit that </v>
<v Speaker 5>you see,</v>

1323
00:56:33.821 --> 00:56:36.670
<v Speaker 5>if you actually look into it and then </v>
<v Speaker 5>you make the judgment,</v>

1324
00:56:36.700 --> 00:56:38.020
<v Speaker 5>you're making the judgment.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Damn.</v>

1325
00:56:39.010 --> 00:56:41.050
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you haven't seen the testimony,</v>

1326
00:56:41.051 --> 00:56:41.700
<v Speaker 5>then yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't.</v>

1327
00:56:41.730 --> 00:56:43.390
<v Speaker 5>We don't know what what he said or it </v>
<v Speaker 5>doesn't.</v>

1328
00:56:44.700 --> 00:56:46.540
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's all on testimony.</v>

1329
00:56:46.720 --> 00:56:51.720
<v Speaker 5>When you're basing on the testimony,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't know anything about these </v>

1330
00:56:51.720 --> 00:56:53.821
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You never know how much of it you're </v>

1331
00:56:53.821 --> 00:56:53.821
<v Speaker 5>getting square with 80 and this is what </v>
<v Speaker 5>they said to.</v>

1332
00:56:53.920 --> 00:56:58.920
<v Speaker 5>They said the response to the British </v>
<v Speaker 5>Ministry of Defense saying,</v>

1333
00:56:59.710 --> 00:57:02.470
<v Speaker 5>if it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if it doesn't concern national security,</v>

1334
00:57:02.471 --> 00:57:04.690
<v Speaker 5>we're not going to get involved.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then 80,</v>

1335
00:57:04.930 --> 00:57:09.430
<v Speaker 5>80 people fucking hallucinated that and </v>
<v Speaker 5>then it got 80 people,</v>

1336
00:57:09.730 --> 00:57:10.990
<v Speaker 5>80 people that are full of shit.</v>

1337
00:57:11.050 --> 00:57:13.390
<v Speaker 5>They got 80 bit needed as neither it </v>
<v Speaker 5>means neither.</v>

1338
00:57:13.391 --> 00:57:18.391
<v Speaker 5>That's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If it means that 80 people were not </v>

1339
00:57:18.391 --> 00:57:18.430
<v Speaker 5>aware of what they were looking at,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's all it means.</v>

1340
00:57:18.680 --> 00:57:22.900
<v Speaker 5>If they're trained to observe them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're in the military,</v>

1341
00:57:22.901 --> 00:57:27.901
<v Speaker 5>doesn't mean anything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If the military people that are in the </v>

1342
00:57:27.901 --> 00:57:31.021
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the people that are there at the scene </v>

1343
00:57:31.021 --> 00:57:33.091
<v Speaker 5>of the crime or the senior landing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if they're not aware of the technology </v>

1344
00:57:33.091 --> 00:57:33.760
<v Speaker 5>that's available to the highest levels </v>
<v Speaker 5>of government,</v>

1345
00:57:33.970 --> 00:57:36.340
<v Speaker 5>they're not aware of whatever </v>
<v Speaker 5>experimental shit they're working on.</v>

1346
00:57:36.520 --> 00:57:41.520
<v Speaker 5>It might as well be from another planet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so what are they going to say if they </v>

1347
00:57:41.520 --> 00:57:42.370
<v Speaker 5>don't know about horse?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Of course nobody knows.</v>

1348
00:57:42.460 --> 00:57:47.460
<v Speaker 5>Nobody was there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but to make a judgment based on the </v>

1349
00:57:47.460 --> 00:57:47.830
<v Speaker 5>testimony,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can totally not believe in God.</v>

1350
00:57:47.831 --> 00:57:49.720
<v Speaker 5>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't believe these guys.</v>

1351
00:57:49.750 --> 00:57:54.750
<v Speaker 5>Or You could look at it and say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to look at what the open mind </v>

1352
00:57:54.750 --> 00:57:54.750
<v Speaker 5>fuck 80 dudes that are trained </v>
<v Speaker 5>observers.</v>

1353
00:57:54.760 --> 00:57:57.640
<v Speaker 5>Three went up to it and touched it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They sat there saying,</v>

1354
00:57:57.700 --> 00:58:01.420
<v Speaker 5>it's out of this fucking world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Definitely they're saying it.</v>

1355
00:58:01.630 --> 00:58:06.630
<v Speaker 5>That's what they're in the military.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The British Ministry of Defense is </v>

1356
00:58:06.630 --> 00:58:10.690
<v Speaker 5>fucking not even looking into it at all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean to the conclusion are you,</v>

1357
00:58:10.930 --> 00:58:14.770
<v Speaker 5>but it's still a bunch of people's </v>
<v Speaker 5>testimonies about something they saw and</v>

1358
00:58:14.771 --> 00:58:19.771
<v Speaker 5>then you might not have known what they </v>
<v Speaker 5>were seeing and then you add all the </v>

1359
00:58:19.771 --> 00:58:20.140
<v Speaker 5>shit around.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's just one incident.</v>

1360
00:58:20.141 --> 00:58:23.280
<v Speaker 5>Then you look at all of it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you connect all the dots and you,</v>

1361
00:58:23.300 --> 00:58:25.570
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can make a decision.</v>

1362
00:58:25.571 --> 00:58:26.770
<v Speaker 5>And my decision,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Mike,</v>

1363
00:58:26.860 --> 00:58:31.860
<v Speaker 5>is that there's some shit going on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's how I feel based on our decision </v>

1364
00:58:31.860 --> 00:58:35.761
<v Speaker 5>is not that at all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My decision as is as there's a lot of </v>

1365
00:58:35.761 --> 00:58:38.290
<v Speaker 5>people with a lot of stories and we know</v>
<v Speaker 5>for a fact that there are a fuck load of</v>

1366
00:58:38.291 --> 00:58:43.291
<v Speaker 5>experimental government aircrafts that </v>
<v Speaker 5>they use for sure they're manned or </v>

1367
00:58:43.511 --> 00:58:46.120
<v Speaker 5>whether they're remote control and you </v>
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>

1368
00:58:46.121 --> 00:58:48.970
<v Speaker 5>all these people are just telling their </v>
<v Speaker 5>version of a story.</v>

1369
00:58:48.970 --> 00:58:53.970
<v Speaker 5>Something that they saw.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I believe they saw something I do not </v>

1370
00:58:53.970 --> 00:58:54.490
<v Speaker 5>believe that they know is from another </v>
<v Speaker 5>world.</v>

1371
00:58:54.790 --> 00:58:56.590
<v Speaker 5>So them even saying it was from another </v>

01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:11.920
<v Speaker 5>an idiot.</v>

1413
01:00:31.690 --> 01:00:34.541
<v Speaker 5>disasters.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They might've been a little children </v>

<v Speaker 5>I assuming.</v>

1418
01:00:45.110 --> 01:00:50.110
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of evidence to dead </v>

1419
01:00:50.110 --> 01:00:50.110
<v Speaker 5>people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>knives,</v>

1420
01:00:50.110 --> 01:00:52.751
<v Speaker 5>blood in his car.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a little different than some dude </v>

1421
01:00:52.751 --> 01:00:52.751
<v Speaker 5>who says he saw a Ufo and doesn't know </v>
<v Speaker 5>what it is,</v>

1422
01:00:53.330 --> 01:00:56.510

<v Speaker 5>testimony and all that stuff.</v>

1425
01:01:00.470 --> 01:01:02.960
<v Speaker 5>That's what we're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A system is fucked up.</v>

1426
01:01:02.990 --> 01:01:07.990
<v Speaker 5>That's why because black people thought </v>
<v Speaker 5>that it was one on their side that they </v>

1427
01:01:07.990 --> 01:01:09.260
<v Speaker 5>were going to release him and if it did </v>
<v Speaker 5>not fit,</v>

1428
01:01:09.261 --> 01:01:14.261
<v Speaker 5>you must acquit and they wanted to get </v>
<v Speaker 5>back at the Rodney King verdict and so </v>

1429
01:01:14.261 --> 01:01:15.030
<v Speaker 5>they released them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's why was not a Ufo ufs.</v>

<v Speaker 5>You guys have like a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a couple that broke up and have </v>

1431
01:01:20.100 --> 01:01:20.100
<v Speaker 5>come together.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Careful.</v>

1432
01:01:20.100 --> 01:01:24.761
<v Speaker 5>You have to be careful when you start </v>
<v Speaker 5>talking about things that you haven't </v>

1433
01:01:24.761 --> 01:01:24.761
<v Speaker 5>seen yourself.</v>

1434
01:01:24.761 --> 01:01:25.730
<v Speaker 5>This is just my opinion when the same </v>
<v Speaker 5>way with you,</v>

1435
01:01:25.731 --> 01:01:28.610
<v Speaker 5>I.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't even if it was the most evidence</v>

1436
01:01:28.611 --> 01:01:33.611
<v Speaker 5>ever,</v>
<v Speaker 5>unless I knew for a fact I saw with my </v>

1437
01:01:33.611 --> 01:01:33.611
<v Speaker 5>own eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just too much bullshit.</v>

1438
01:01:33.611 --> 01:01:36.260
<v Speaker 5>I don't follow anything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why stress out about it?</v>

1439
01:01:36.310 --> 01:01:38.900
<v Speaker 5>It's there's too much bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's 20 people are full of Shit.</v>

1440
01:01:39.030 --> 01:01:42.350
<v Speaker 5>Too many people exaggerate too many </v>
<v Speaker 5>people twist the truth and there's a big</v>

1441
01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:46.110
<v Speaker 5>business and talking about Ufos and </v>
<v Speaker 5>that's another thing to be careful of.</v>

1442
01:01:46.380 --> 01:01:50.420
<v Speaker 5>There's a gigantic business and writing </v>
<v Speaker 5>books about this shit and doing lectures</v>

1443
01:01:50.421 --> 01:01:53.690
<v Speaker 5>and seminars and these guys make a </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking good living.</v>

1444
01:01:53.691 --> 01:01:57.300
<v Speaker 5>Traveling the country,</v>
<v Speaker 5>selling books and talking about Ufos.</v>

1445
01:01:57.500 --> 01:02:00.770
<v Speaker 5>Whenever you involve commerce in a very </v>
<v Speaker 5>strange discussion,</v>

1446
01:02:00.950 --> 01:02:05.950
<v Speaker 5>like the discussion of the potential </v>
<v Speaker 5>reality of our intelligent life from </v>

1447
01:02:05.950 --> 01:02:10.511
<v Speaker 5>other planets.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whenever you involve money in that and </v>

1448
01:02:10.511 --> 01:02:10.511
<v Speaker 5>money and then in the stories.</v>

1449
01:02:10.511 --> 01:02:15.090
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then it becomes sort of a faction of </v>

1450
01:02:15.090 --> 01:02:16.961
<v Speaker 5>show business.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean Whitley strieber is one of the </v>

1451
01:02:16.961 --> 01:02:19.350
<v Speaker 5>fucking biggest proponents of the alien </v>
<v Speaker 5>abduction story and wrote books on it,</v>

1452
01:02:19.351 --> 01:02:24.351
<v Speaker 5>communion and had movies made about it </v>
<v Speaker 5>and that guy is a fucking book writer.</v>

1453
01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:26.640
<v Speaker 5>He writes books.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He makes fiction.</v>

1454
01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:31.880
<v Speaker 5>He makes fiction and he created this </v>
<v Speaker 5>whole thing about getting abducted by </v>

1455
01:02:31.880 --> 01:02:33.690
<v Speaker 5>UFOS and everybody took it as fact and </v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

1456
01:02:33.691 --> 01:02:38.691
<v Speaker 5>who the fuck knows of it's fact.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You got a guy who's a professional </v>

1457
01:02:38.691 --> 01:02:41.841
<v Speaker 5>fiction man and you don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't know what's going on in his </v>

1458
01:02:41.841 --> 01:02:41.841
<v Speaker 5>head.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In his head.</v>

1459
01:02:41.841 --> 01:02:45.110
<v Speaker 5>There's no evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like it's like there may be Ufo is.</v>

1460
01:02:45.150 --> 01:02:46.650
<v Speaker 5>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There may be.</v>

1461
01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:49.170
<v Speaker 5>There may be intelligent life from other</v>
<v Speaker 5>plants.</v>

1462
01:02:49.380 --> 01:02:50.700
<v Speaker 5>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There may be,</v>

1463
01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:53.190
<v Speaker 5>but you can't just jump on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

1464
01:02:53.370 --> 01:02:54.570
<v Speaker 5>Because you jump on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

1465
01:02:54.580 --> 01:02:55.970
<v Speaker 5>What did I just jumped on?</v>

1466
01:02:56.220 --> 01:02:56.810
<v Speaker 5>Jumped on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It did.</v>

1467
01:02:56.811 --> 01:02:59.310
<v Speaker 5>I didn't jump on it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just so much research.</v>

1468
01:02:59.430 --> 01:03:01.260
<v Speaker 5>I fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm obsessed with you.</v>

1469
01:03:01.690 --> 01:03:03.690
<v Speaker 5>I do a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't just jump on it.</v>

1470
01:03:03.810 --> 01:03:06.720
<v Speaker 5>I listened to a lot of tests.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You said you jumped at,</v>

1471
01:03:06.800 --> 01:03:09.680
<v Speaker 5>but I didn't just jump on it like you're</v>
<v Speaker 5>making it seem like you were like,</v>

1472
01:03:09.750 --> 01:03:12.390
<v Speaker 5>I heard one testimony and that's not </v>
<v Speaker 5>what I'm saying.</v>

1473
01:03:12.391 --> 01:03:14.580
<v Speaker 5>I'm saying you look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you listen to what I said,</v>

1474
01:03:14.610 --> 01:03:18.120
<v Speaker 5>what I said was that you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>unless you experiencing it yourself,</v>

1475
01:03:18.180 --> 01:03:23.180
<v Speaker 5>you don't know exactly what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When you talking about people that are </v>

1476
01:03:23.180 --> 01:03:24.180
<v Speaker 5>talking about crafts that they think </v>
<v Speaker 5>were from another world,</v>

1477
01:03:24.330 --> 01:03:27.120
<v Speaker 5>you don't know where it really came from</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that gets very,</v>

1478
01:03:27.121 --> 01:03:32.121
<v Speaker 5>very tricky and if you choose to believe</v>
<v Speaker 5>or not to believe you're jumping on one </v>

1479
01:03:32.121 --> 01:03:32.520
<v Speaker 5>side or another,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you're saying,</v>

1480
01:03:32.730 --> 01:03:35.340
<v Speaker 5>I don't think there's [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think everyone's full of shit.</v>

1481
01:03:35.580 --> 01:03:36.840
<v Speaker 5>You're sick,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're jumping on.</v>

1482
01:03:36.841 --> 01:03:37.920
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and if you say,</v>

1483
01:03:37.921 --> 01:03:39.420
<v Speaker 5>I do believe,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I believe you're here.</v>

1484
01:03:39.510 --> 01:03:40.650
<v Speaker 5>You're jumping on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

1485
01:03:40.740 --> 01:03:43.440
<v Speaker 5>Even if there's a lot of what you think </v>
<v Speaker 5>is evidence,</v>

1486
01:03:43.650 --> 01:03:46.530
<v Speaker 5>unless you're seeing it yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 5>unless it has been proven,</v>

1487
01:03:46.531 --> 01:03:49.320
<v Speaker 5>which clearly hasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's clearly up for debate.</v>

1488
01:03:49.470 --> 01:03:51.030
<v Speaker 5>Even though there's a bunch of people </v>
<v Speaker 5>that come forward,</v>

1489
01:03:51.180 --> 01:03:53.430
<v Speaker 5>whether there's 100 or a thousand and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they say,</v>

1490
01:03:53.450 --> 01:03:55.680
<v Speaker 5>I have crazy stories about things that </v>
<v Speaker 5>move too fast.</v>

1491
01:03:55.740 --> 01:03:58.320
<v Speaker 5>Who the fuck knows what that is?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Who knows?</v>

1492
01:03:58.740 --> 01:04:00.440
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't believe in your phones.</v>

1493
01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:03.630
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

1494
01:04:04.260 --> 01:04:04.940
<v Speaker 5>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 5>are you.</v>

1495
01:04:04.980 --> 01:04:06.510
<v Speaker 5>Are you kidding?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're kidding.</v>

1496
01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:07.350
<v Speaker 5>You're kidding,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1497
01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:10.320
<v Speaker 5>I'm not kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's not what I'm saying.</v>

1498
01:04:11.550 --> 01:04:14.550
<v Speaker 5>I'm not saying that I don't believe in </v>
<v Speaker 5>your fault what I'm saying.</v>

1499
01:04:14.551 --> 01:04:16.650
<v Speaker 5>You don't know why no one knows nothing </v>
<v Speaker 5>else.</v>

1500
01:04:16.651 --> 01:04:17.550
<v Speaker 5>No Man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1501
01:04:17.570 --> 01:04:17.820
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

1502
01:04:17.821 --> 01:04:19.800
<v Speaker 5>That's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Believe when you believe something,</v>

1503
01:04:20.040 --> 01:04:22.830
<v Speaker 5>it's like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for like based on the evidence,</v>

1504
01:04:22.980 --> 01:04:26.490
<v Speaker 5>I believe there's some shit going on </v>
<v Speaker 5>with other galaxies,</v>

1505
01:04:26.760 --> 01:04:28.650
<v Speaker 5>so that's what I believe possible.</v>

1506
01:04:28.770 --> 01:04:31.680
<v Speaker 5>That there's life on other planets.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's certainly possible.</v>

1507
01:04:31.920 --> 01:04:36.920
<v Speaker 5>It's also possible that life is a dream.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's also possible that your life is </v>

1508
01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:41.120
<v Speaker 5>imagination and you've made it all up </v>
<v Speaker 5>and I'm a figment of your imagination </v>

1509
01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:44.941
<v Speaker 5>and each player is in your life to </v>
<v Speaker 5>provide you with some information and </v>

1510
01:04:44.941 --> 01:04:45.870
<v Speaker 5>try to help you and move you along in a </v>
<v Speaker 5>certain way.</v>

1511
01:04:45.871 --> 01:04:48.000
<v Speaker 5>It's very possible that this life is not</v>
<v Speaker 5>even real.</v>

1512
01:04:48.780 --> 01:04:53.780
<v Speaker 5>It's very possible that I'm in your </v>
<v Speaker 5>imagination in urine mine and we sell </v>

1513
01:04:53.780 --> 01:04:55.440
<v Speaker 5>create because a lot of different </v>
<v Speaker 5>possibilities that's possible,</v>

1514
01:04:55.950 --> 01:05:00.950
<v Speaker 5>but whether or not there's Ufo because </v>
<v Speaker 5>some people that you don't know who </v>

1515
01:05:00.950 --> 01:05:01.650
<v Speaker 5>you've never met saw some things that </v>
<v Speaker 5>you never saw and said.</v>

1516
01:05:01.651 --> 01:05:03.990
<v Speaker 5>They wrote it down and had conferences </v>
<v Speaker 5>and discussions about.</v>

1517
01:05:04.470 --> 01:05:06.090
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know about that.</v>

1518
01:05:08.190 --> 01:05:13.190
<v Speaker 5>Do you guys like sweet potato fries?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just,</v>

1519
01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:14.940
<v Speaker 5>it's a tricky thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

1520
01:05:14.970 --> 01:05:19.970
<v Speaker 5>It's we attach ourselves to what we </v>
<v Speaker 5>believe in and you obviously are getting</v>

1521
01:05:20.771 --> 01:05:25.771
<v Speaker 5>attached to this idea of being real </v>
<v Speaker 5>because you've spent so much time </v>

1522
01:05:25.771 --> 01:05:27.040
<v Speaker 5>invested,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so much time being fascinated by it,</v>

1523
01:05:27.870 --> 01:05:32.870
<v Speaker 5>fascinated with.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm fascinated with the testimony and </v>

1524
01:05:32.870 --> 01:05:33.670
<v Speaker 5>putting it all together.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're making it sound like.</v>

1525
01:05:33.671 --> 01:05:35.190
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like mystic law.</v>

1526
01:05:35.191 --> 01:05:40.191
<v Speaker 5>I'm not man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not making a song that I am saying </v>

1527
01:05:40.191 --> 01:05:40.960
<v Speaker 5>exactly what you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but what I am fascinated by people and I</v>

1528
01:05:40.961 --> 01:05:45.961
<v Speaker 5>know that people are full of shit and </v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not assuming that all these people </v>

1529
01:05:45.961 --> 01:05:49.861
<v Speaker 5>are pious.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not assuming that all these people </v>

1530
01:05:49.861 --> 01:05:51.901
<v Speaker 5>are completely honest and without </v>
<v Speaker 5>ulterior motive and telling you exactly </v>

1531
01:05:52.340 --> 01:05:54.040
<v Speaker 5>know as they saw it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The truth.</v>

1532
01:05:54.190 --> 01:05:59.190
<v Speaker 5>I'm not seeing that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm seeing a bunch of believers and </v>

1533
01:05:59.190 --> 01:05:59.190
<v Speaker 5>that's the problem.</v>

1534
01:05:59.190 --> 01:06:00.910
<v Speaker 5>Even if you saw something fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>completely insane,</v>

1535
01:06:01.300 --> 01:06:03.730
<v Speaker 5>I don't want you telling me you know </v>
<v Speaker 5>what it is.</v>

1536
01:06:03.940 --> 01:06:08.940
<v Speaker 5>I don't want you describing it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want you saying I don't know what it </v>

1537
01:06:08.940 --> 01:06:08.950
<v Speaker 5>was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want you to say,</v>

1538
01:06:08.951 --> 01:06:10.150
<v Speaker 5>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1539
01:06:10.370 --> 01:06:13.540
<v Speaker 5>it could've been some sort of a craft </v>
<v Speaker 5>that I'm not aware of.</v>

1540
01:06:13.810 --> 01:06:17.260
<v Speaker 5>It could be a Ufo means man and </v>
<v Speaker 5>identified flying objects.</v>

1541
01:06:17.750 --> 01:06:19.120
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're not saying you,</v>

1542
01:06:19.430 --> 01:06:21.670
<v Speaker 5>you're saying aliens,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1543
01:06:22.390 --> 01:06:23.050
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1544
01:06:23.051 --> 01:06:25.300
<v Speaker 5>I'm not saying aliens.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm saying unknown.</v>

1545
01:06:25.730 --> 01:06:30.730
<v Speaker 5>And when someone says they know and they</v>
<v Speaker 5>start talking about it being from </v>

1546
01:06:30.730 --> 01:06:30.730
<v Speaker 5>another planet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>bitch,</v>

1547
01:06:30.730 --> 01:06:34.711
<v Speaker 5>do you have like some fucking serial </v>
<v Speaker 5>numbers you can track back to this </v>

1548
01:06:34.711 --> 01:06:34.711
<v Speaker 5>planet?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like how do you know where it came from?</v>

1549
01:06:34.711 --> 01:06:36.370
<v Speaker 5>You don't know shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're just taking a guess.</v>

1550
01:06:36.371 --> 01:06:38.500
<v Speaker 5>They see something in the sky.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't build.</v>

1551
01:06:38.501 --> 01:06:39.730
<v Speaker 5>It must be from space.</v>

1552
01:06:39.970 --> 01:06:42.010
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's that simple.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not that simple.</v>

1553
01:06:42.220 --> 01:06:45.040
<v Speaker 5>Like I go through that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It is that simple.</v>

1554
01:06:45.041 --> 01:06:46.630
<v Speaker 5>If you want to claim,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know where it came from,</v>

1555
01:06:46.810 --> 01:06:47.440
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1556
01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:48.880
<v Speaker 5>He can't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1557
01:06:48.910 --> 01:06:49.840
<v Speaker 5>you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1558
01:06:49.960 --> 01:06:52.150
<v Speaker 5>no one's saying they know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you don't know,</v>

1559
01:06:52.151 --> 01:06:54.580
<v Speaker 5>if you haven't seen it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't know where it came from.</v>

1560
01:06:54.581 --> 01:06:59.581
<v Speaker 5>You haven't watched the video of it </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking flying off that planet and </v>

1561
01:06:59.581 --> 01:06:59.581
<v Speaker 5>landing here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then it's digital.</v>

1562
01:06:59.581 --> 01:07:02.260
<v Speaker 5>A lot of fucking guesswork.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a romantic idea.</v>

1563
01:07:02.261 --> 01:07:05.560
<v Speaker 5>The idea seems so cool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The idea that there's fucking alien.</v>

1564
01:07:05.561 --> 01:07:07.810
<v Speaker 5>It's tricky because you get sucked into </v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

1565
01:07:07.811 --> 01:07:10.870
<v Speaker 5>Like it seems so awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So does the loch ness monster,</v>

1566
01:07:11.140 --> 01:07:16.140
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like we have this built in shit in </v>

1567
01:07:16.140 --> 01:07:18.301
<v Speaker 5>our head.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's nothing like the monster van </v>

1568
01:07:18.301 --> 01:07:21.100
<v Speaker 5>lochness monster is like bigfoot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not bigfoot is a real animal.</v>

1569
01:07:21.280 --> 01:07:26.280
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they have isolated in an animal called </v>

1570
01:07:26.280 --> 01:07:28.711
<v Speaker 5>gigantic [inaudible] that they believe </v>
<v Speaker 5>if human beings came down to the bering </v>

1571
01:07:28.711 --> 01:07:33.420
<v Speaker 5>strait and they came from Asia,</v>
<v Speaker 5>gigantic [inaudible] lived in Asia as </v>

1572
01:07:33.420 --> 01:07:33.790
<v Speaker 5>recently as 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>years ago.</v>

1573
01:07:34.030 --> 01:07:37.420
<v Speaker 5>It was a bipedal primate that was eight </v>
<v Speaker 5>to 10 feet tall.</v>

1574
01:07:38.350 --> 01:07:40.510
<v Speaker 5>So I believe in bigfoot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's an animal.</v>

1575
01:07:40.580 --> 01:07:42.400
<v Speaker 5>It was whether or not believe people see</v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

1576
01:07:43.020 --> 01:07:44.080
<v Speaker 5>What do the fuck knows,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man?</v>

1577
01:07:44.081 --> 01:07:46.870
<v Speaker 5>There was wooly mammoths and Saber Tooth</v>
<v Speaker 5>Tigers here 10,000</v>

1578
01:07:46.871 --> 01:07:48.580
<v Speaker 5>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 5>seven foot tall,</v>

1579
01:07:48.581 --> 01:07:51.760
<v Speaker 5>giant fucking birds like a few hundred </v>
<v Speaker 5>thousand years ago.</v>

1580
01:07:51.880 --> 01:07:56.880
<v Speaker 5>There was animals on this planet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in this continent that don't exist </v>

1581
01:07:56.880 --> 01:07:57.510
<v Speaker 5>anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that were pretty fucking crazy.</v>

1582
01:07:57.650 --> 01:08:02.650
<v Speaker 5>Craziest.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Saber tooth tigers are crazier than </v>

1583
01:08:02.650 --> 01:08:02.650
<v Speaker 5>bigfoot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bigfoot's.</v>

1584
01:08:02.650 --> 01:08:06.031
<v Speaker 5>Just another big monkey.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If big foot was gigantic because it's </v>

1585
01:08:06.031 --> 01:08:06.970
<v Speaker 5>just another large primate that went </v>
<v Speaker 5>extinct,</v>

1586
01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.790
<v Speaker 5>whereas big foot supposed to be living </v>
<v Speaker 5>Pacific northwest,</v>

1587
01:08:09.791 --> 01:08:12.970
<v Speaker 5>which is if you follow the the traveling</v>
<v Speaker 5>down the bering strait,</v>

1588
01:08:12.971 --> 01:08:16.220
<v Speaker 5>which is where Indians came here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>American Indians</v>

1589
01:08:16.220 --> 01:08:21.110
<v Speaker 1>originated in Siberia and Asia and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>came down from there.</v>

1590
01:08:21.260 --> 01:08:23.540
<v Speaker 1>America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what people don't realize is 10,000</v>

1591
01:08:23.541 --> 01:08:28.541
<v Speaker 1>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>half of America was under a mile high </v>

1592
01:08:28.541 --> 01:08:30.020
<v Speaker 1>sheet of ice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was covered in ice.</v>

1593
01:08:30.021 --> 01:08:35.021
<v Speaker 1>It's like a barren land,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but something dramatic happened to the </v>

1594
01:08:35.021 --> 01:08:36.020
<v Speaker 1>environment of the earth and the ice </v>
<v Speaker 1>age.</v>

1595
01:08:36.021 --> 01:08:41.021
<v Speaker 1>When it ended,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the America opened up and that's when </v>

1596
01:08:41.021 --> 01:08:41.510
<v Speaker 1>people started moving here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When people,</v>

1597
01:08:41.511 --> 01:08:42.740
<v Speaker 1>some of the people had already moved </v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

1598
01:08:42.741 --> 01:08:43.250
<v Speaker 1>There was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was.</v>

1599
01:08:43.410 --> 01:08:45.770
<v Speaker 1>They found Chinese bodies here from </v>
<v Speaker 1>10,000</v>

1600
01:08:45.771 --> 01:08:47.380
<v Speaker 1>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when,</v>

1601
01:08:47.390 --> 01:08:50.180
<v Speaker 1>when people started moving here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they came from there.</v>

1602
01:08:50.181 --> 01:08:55.181
<v Speaker 1>They came from the Bering Strait.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like the number one theory of a </v>

1603
01:08:55.181 --> 01:08:58.181
<v Speaker 1>big percentage of the American Indians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they came down from Asia and this </v>

1604
01:08:58.181 --> 01:09:01.240
<v Speaker 1>monkey lived in Asia and if this thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>followed them with the fuck knows,</v>

1605
01:09:01.250 --> 01:09:03.650
<v Speaker 1>is there any compelling evidence for </v>
<v Speaker 1>Loch Ness Monster?</v>

1606
01:09:03.770 --> 01:09:06.590
<v Speaker 1>There's pictures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's their scans from radar,</v>

1607
01:09:06.620 --> 01:09:11.620
<v Speaker 1>they think it could be a big fish that </v>
<v Speaker 1>could have got landlocked that was </v>

1608
01:09:11.620 --> 01:09:11.620
<v Speaker 1>extinct in other places,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not there.</v>

1609
01:09:11.620 --> 01:09:14.540
<v Speaker 1>The problem with Loch ness is it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>really murky.</v>

1610
01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:17.090
<v Speaker 1>They can't see and it could be a bunch </v>
<v Speaker 1>of other things.</v>

1611
01:09:17.100 --> 01:09:22.100
<v Speaker 1>Could be a bunch of other things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people are misconstruing and there's </v>

1612
01:09:22.100 --> 01:09:22.160
<v Speaker 1>been a bunch of hoaxes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when,</v>

1613
01:09:22.161 --> 01:09:24.260
<v Speaker 1>when enough people have seen things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got to wonder,</v>

1614
01:09:24.261 --> 01:09:24.980
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>

1615
01:09:24.981 --> 01:09:29.981
<v Speaker 1>Is it an eel?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it when you got to think of all the </v>

1616
01:09:29.981 --> 01:09:29.981
<v Speaker 1>animals that are real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1617
01:09:29.981 --> 01:09:34.060
<v Speaker 1>is it a adult in Moseley floating wood </v>
<v Speaker 1>and just people knowing the story and </v>

1618
01:09:34.060 --> 01:09:34.060
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1619
01:09:34.060 --> 01:09:38.981
<v Speaker 1>there it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's more evidence for big foot or </v>

1620
01:09:38.981 --> 01:09:39.500
<v Speaker 1>loch ness monster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably bigfoot because bigfoot,</v>

1621
01:09:39.501 --> 01:09:41.420
<v Speaker 1>there's the American Indians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a big,</v>

1622
01:09:41.540 --> 01:09:46.540
<v Speaker 1>big part of the lure of big foot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's over 250 American Indian names </v>

1623
01:09:46.540 --> 01:09:51.101
<v Speaker 1>for big foot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Big Foot was born in the imagination of </v>

1624
01:09:51.101 --> 01:09:51.860
<v Speaker 1>an American Indian that just might've </v>
<v Speaker 1>made that mention.</v>

1625
01:09:52.250 --> 01:09:57.250
<v Speaker 1>It might've been 20 big foot was born in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the head of an American Indian.</v>

1626
01:09:58.320 --> 01:10:03.320
<v Speaker 1>That was just winning at attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You imagine one dude came up with that </v>

1627
01:10:04.520 --> 01:10:08.420
<v Speaker 1>and spread it happened in every.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the other ones that somebody hearing</v>

1628
01:10:08.421 --> 01:10:11.180
<v Speaker 1>that same story and just being paranoid </v>
<v Speaker 1>walking through the woods later.</v>

1629
01:10:11.470 --> 01:10:16.470
<v Speaker 1>It's like other tribes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other tribes with like these fucking </v>

1630
01:10:16.470 --> 01:10:20.080
<v Speaker 1>costumes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like bear costume was the most </v>

1631
01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:20.240
<v Speaker 1>compelling evidence about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Big Foot is actually the audio tapes.</v>

1632
01:10:20.480 --> 01:10:25.480
<v Speaker 1>There's these audio tapes of these crazy</v>
<v Speaker 1>primate howls that they've recorded in </v>

1633
01:10:25.480 --> 01:10:28.070
<v Speaker 1>the Pacific northwest and they're really</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking loud.</v>

1634
01:10:28.250 --> 01:10:31.160
<v Speaker 1>They're really loud and interesting and </v>
<v Speaker 1>these have been done,</v>

1635
01:10:31.370 --> 01:10:36.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and and supposedly by legit scientists </v>

1636
01:10:36.370 --> 01:10:40.080
<v Speaker 1>that have recorded these sounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it could be somebody let a monkey </v>

1637
01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:40.670
<v Speaker 1>loose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had a crazy pet monkey and they let</v>

1638
01:10:40.671 --> 01:10:42.620
<v Speaker 1>that motherfucker lose and he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>screaming in the woods.</v>

1639
01:10:42.830 --> 01:10:47.830
<v Speaker 1>We put you in the woods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could make up some sounds that they </v>

1640
01:10:47.830 --> 01:10:47.830
<v Speaker 1>would think of as big foot in lochness </v>
<v Speaker 1>announcements.</v>

1641
01:10:47.830 --> 01:10:48.900
<v Speaker 1>Baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the worst?</v>

1642
01:10:48.901 --> 01:10:51.580
<v Speaker 1>The conspiracy to like the worst one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Flat Earth.</v>

1643
01:10:51.990 --> 01:10:54.500
<v Speaker 1>There's people that flat to the young </v>
<v Speaker 1>earth.</v>

1644
01:10:54.501 --> 01:10:55.610
<v Speaker 1>That's another bad one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1645
01:10:55.620 --> 01:10:55.940
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1646
01:10:55.941 --> 01:10:56.720
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like today,</v>

1647
01:10:56.721 --> 01:10:59.480
<v Speaker 1>people don't believe that young earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They believe the young earth.</v>

1648
01:10:59.540 --> 01:11:01.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a big percentage of the Christian</v>

1649
01:11:01.371 --> 01:11:03.470
<v Speaker 1>population.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a guy on twitter,</v>

1650
01:11:03.471 --> 01:11:05.810
<v Speaker 1>I follow them all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just crazy retarded.</v>

1651
01:11:05.811 --> 01:11:08.960
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Christian young Earth Guy who's always</v>

1652
01:11:08.961 --> 01:11:11.460
<v Speaker 1>talking about the evidence against </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolution.</v>

1653
01:11:11.490 --> 01:11:13.330
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These youtube videos just,</v>

1654
01:11:13.470 --> 01:11:18.470
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't watch them for more than five </v>

1655
01:11:18.470 --> 01:11:20.481
<v Speaker 1>minutes because the insanity radiates </v>
<v Speaker 1>off the screen and it starts to get you </v>

1656
01:11:20.481 --> 01:11:21.680
<v Speaker 1>blond hair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cute Lips was really nice.</v>

1657
01:11:22.410 --> 01:11:27.410
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they believed that the earth is less </v>

1658
01:11:27.410 --> 01:11:27.410
<v Speaker 1>than 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years old.</v>

1659
01:11:27.410 --> 01:11:30.860
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more than 50 percent during a recent </v>

1660
01:11:30.860 --> 01:11:31.590
<v Speaker 1>Gallup poll in the United States believe</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the earth,</v>

1661
01:11:32.080 --> 01:11:34.230
<v Speaker 1>the earth is the age that is depicted in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Bible,</v>

1662
01:11:34.231 --> 01:11:35.610
<v Speaker 1>which is less than 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years old.</v>

1663
01:11:35.640 --> 01:11:36.800
<v Speaker 1>They probably don't even know what that </v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

1664
01:11:36.801 --> 01:11:38.450
<v Speaker 1>I was going to the Bible say that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1665
01:11:38.460 --> 01:11:40.950
<v Speaker 1>it's the Bible probably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does,</v>

1666
01:11:41.010 --> 01:11:42.770
<v Speaker 1>what does Jesus thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1667
01:11:42.870 --> 01:11:47.870
<v Speaker 1>That's all they have to hear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of dumb ass conspiracy </v>

1668
01:11:47.870 --> 01:11:47.870
<v Speaker 1>theories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Big Foot's not the dumbest one.</v>

1669
01:11:48.090 --> 01:11:48.930
<v Speaker 1>Big Foot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

1670
01:11:48.931 --> 01:11:51.120
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a real animal that they can lock</v>

1671
01:11:51.121 --> 01:11:52.890
<v Speaker 1>that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like if there's one,</v>

1672
01:11:52.891 --> 01:11:55.710
<v Speaker 1>the Jersey Devil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some fucking giant monster,</v>

1673
01:11:55.711 --> 01:11:58.800
<v Speaker 1>that's like half the one God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I to Texas one.</v>

1674
01:11:58.801 --> 01:12:00.960
<v Speaker 1>Well the two Chupacabra,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've narrowed that down to.</v>

1675
01:12:00.961 --> 01:12:05.961
<v Speaker 1>They think it's mange mange on coyotes </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they've had dead coyotes that </v>

1676
01:12:05.961 --> 01:12:07.710
<v Speaker 1>they've shot and killed that were </v>
<v Speaker 1>covered in mange.</v>

1677
01:12:07.980 --> 01:12:12.340
<v Speaker 1>Do they don't even look real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They look like Zombie Coyote looked like</v>

1678
01:12:12.570 --> 01:12:14.430
<v Speaker 1>ghouls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They lose all their hair.</v>

1679
01:12:14.431 --> 01:12:19.431
<v Speaker 1>It's an.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a common disease and they have </v>

1680
01:12:19.431 --> 01:12:19.431
<v Speaker 1>photos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's photos of him online.</v>

1681
01:12:19.431 --> 01:12:23.361
<v Speaker 1>If you look Chupa Cobra,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have a headless when they chopped </v>

1682
01:12:23.361 --> 01:12:26.691
<v Speaker 1>its head off and it's a coyote to coyote</v>
<v Speaker 1>that horrible mange and it has like </v>

1683
01:12:26.691 --> 01:12:30.380
<v Speaker 1>almost blue dark bluish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blackish skin and no hair and it looks </v>

1684
01:12:30.380 --> 01:12:30.810
<v Speaker 1>like a monster.</v>

1685
01:12:30.990 --> 01:12:35.990
<v Speaker 1>So that's most likely the origin of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>tube macabre because you're talking </v>

1686
01:12:35.990 --> 01:12:36.900
<v Speaker 1>about something that killed goats and </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit and killed chickens.</v>

1687
01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:39.290
<v Speaker 1>That's what coyotes do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>

1688
01:12:39.291 --> 01:12:40.740
<v Speaker 1>So they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have that narrowed down.</v>

1689
01:12:41.010 --> 01:12:42.450
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was at the zoo this weekend,</v>

1690
01:12:42.451 --> 01:12:45.750
<v Speaker 1>man and I saw a leopard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had a leopard there and that it was</v>

1691
01:12:45.751 --> 01:12:49.620
<v Speaker 1>so sad that just pacing around just </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't get to jack anything.</v>

1692
01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:51.450
<v Speaker 1>Just pacing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at all these people staring down.</v>

1693
01:12:51.680 --> 01:12:56.680
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've started to find leopards in </v>

1694
01:12:56.680 --> 01:12:56.680
<v Speaker 1>America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brown.</v>

1695
01:12:56.680 --> 01:12:58.940
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That prints have made their way to </v>

1696
01:12:58.940 --> 01:12:58.940
<v Speaker 1>Phoenix?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1697
01:12:58.940 --> 01:12:58.980
<v Speaker 1>there's leopard sightings in Arizona.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>

1698
01:12:58.981 --> 01:13:03.981
<v Speaker 1>that's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now they're coming up through South </v>

1699
01:13:03.981 --> 01:13:06.540
<v Speaker 1>America and through Mexico and into </v>
<v Speaker 1>America leopards pro.</v>

1700
01:13:06.660 --> 01:13:08.760
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Leopards are no joke.</v>

1701
01:13:09.420 --> 01:13:12.240
<v Speaker 1>Could you imagine if you were the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>American to get jacked by a leopard?</v>

1702
01:13:12.750 --> 01:13:15.140
<v Speaker 1>Love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What'd you check?</v>

1703
01:13:15.390 --> 01:13:18.600
<v Speaker 1>There'll be leopard hunting season and </v>
<v Speaker 1>those motherfuckers will be wiped out.</v>

1704
01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:23.010
<v Speaker 1>Do you think so man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tried to go into Texas in Texas.</v>

1705
01:13:23.190 --> 01:13:25.320
<v Speaker 1>They don't even have to open up a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hunting season in Texas.</v>

1706
01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:27.880
<v Speaker 1>They'll just start shooting them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The kids will shoot him.</v>

1707
01:13:28.850 --> 01:13:33.210
<v Speaker 1>Who were we talking about the other day?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was jogging and they shot something</v>

1708

<v Speaker 1>fucking Predator attacks.</v>

1721
01:14:05.430 --> 01:14:08.310
<v Speaker 1>You don't have a gun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially when it's somebody that wants</v>

1722
01:14:08.311 --> 01:14:10.380

<v Speaker 5>You got to use that shit.</v>

1728
01:14:19.820 --> 01:14:22.090
<v Speaker 3>I haven't been thinking really hard </v>
<v Speaker 3>about getting a gun lately.</v>

1729
01:14:22.100 --> 01:14:27.100
<v Speaker 3>Let me and like there's two of my </v>
<v Speaker 3>friends that were both saying like they </v>

1730
01:14:27.100 --> 01:14:27.100
<v Speaker 3>just called me randomly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1731
01:14:27.100 --> 01:14:27.100
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you wanna get a gun?</v>

1732
01:14:27.190 --> 01:14:29.840
<v Speaker 3>I think it was Duncan or somebody added </v>
<v Speaker 3>a habit and not to need it.</v>

1733
01:14:30.080 --> 01:14:35.080
<v Speaker 5>Needed not to have it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can't control all these people and </v>

1734
01:14:35.080 --> 01:14:37.420
<v Speaker 5>this world living out in the wilderness </v>
<v Speaker 5>like you did.</v>

1735
01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:41.320
<v Speaker 5>We talked about this before.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a lot like you know,</v>

1736
01:14:41.410 --> 01:14:44.230
<v Speaker 5>no matter where you go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you got to deal with some death.</v>

1737
01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:49.320
<v Speaker 5>Either you live in the city and you've </v>
<v Speaker 5>got to deal with muggers and rapists or </v>

1738
01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:53.161
<v Speaker 5>like gang bangers or something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All you live way out away from that </v>

1739
01:14:53.161 --> 01:14:57.271
<v Speaker 5>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No Gang bangers are going out into the </v>

1740
01:14:57.271 --> 01:14:59.790
<v Speaker 5>wilderness,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but then you've got to do with mountain </v>

1741
01:14:59.790 --> 01:15:01.531
<v Speaker 5>lions and shit like that to deal with </v>
<v Speaker 5>things and you gotta deal with weird </v>

1742
01:15:01.531 --> 01:15:04.891
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>At least you can shoot them and you're </v>

1743
01:15:04.891 --> 01:15:06.721
<v Speaker 5>cool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you could just look at them and go </v>

1744
01:15:06.721 --> 01:15:08.340
<v Speaker 5>Bam and just blast them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can't do that top bugger until he </v>

1745
01:15:08.340 --> 01:15:08.340
<v Speaker 5>jumps on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You got to be careful with bears because</v>

1746
01:15:08.340 --> 01:15:09.100
<v Speaker 5>bears are hard to kill.</v>

1747
01:15:09.340 --> 01:15:11.020
<v Speaker 5>It's very hard to kill a bear with a </v>
<v Speaker 5>pistol.</v>

1748
01:15:11.350 --> 01:15:13.120
<v Speaker 5>If you've got a bear,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're better off shooting.</v>

1749
01:15:13.121 --> 01:15:15.490
<v Speaker 5>And what about bear Mace works?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1750
01:15:15.730 --> 01:15:20.730
<v Speaker 5>You got to get them with it though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They've got to be close enough for you </v>

1751
01:15:20.730 --> 01:15:22.771
<v Speaker 5>to get on with it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't even know bear mace existed </v>

1752
01:15:22.771 --> 01:15:23.200
<v Speaker 5>until South Park when I got to be </v>
<v Speaker 5>careful.</v>

1753

<v Speaker 5>was in the South Park is based on </v>

1755
01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:30.000
<v Speaker 5>evergreen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's where those guys grew up.</v>

1756

01:15:38.731 --> 01:15:42.301
<v Speaker 5>park is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what it's based on actually from </v>

1760
01:15:42.301 --> 01:15:42.301
<v Speaker 5>Denver.</v>

<v Speaker 3>alcoholic beverage,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you always drink with the mushrooms and </v>

1785
01:16:37.550 --> 01:16:37.550
<v Speaker 3>coconut water.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He loves the Kabuki,</v>

1786
01:16:37.550 --> 01:16:41.270

<v Speaker 3>but he uses it for a Pina coladas.</v>

1787
01:16:41.570 --> 01:16:44.450
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't like this stuff now.</v>

01:16:44.451 --> 01:16:49.451

<v Speaker 3>taste,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but vodka,</v>

<v Speaker 3>When you get older,</v>

1791
01:16:51.531 --> 01:16:52.480

01:18:18.890 --> 01:18:21.140
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't mean it's not real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't mean they're not real,</v>

1823
01:18:21.141 --> 01:18:23.650
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't mean they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you put,</v>

1824
01:18:23.660 --> 01:18:27.290
<v Speaker 1>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's most likely I will say that I'll,</v>

1825
01:18:27.340 --> 01:18:32.340
<v Speaker 1>I'll take back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe and I say it's most likely </v>

1826
01:18:32.340 --> 01:18:32.340
<v Speaker 1>real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gotten better.</v>

1827
01:18:32.430 --> 01:18:34.400
<v Speaker 1>Is that better?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

1828
01:18:34.970 --> 01:18:37.880
<v Speaker 1>Why even have a fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is about opinions.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Like what are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>just can't just speak to why.</v>

1831
01:18:40.970 --> 01:18:42.530
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why become attached.</v>

1832
01:18:43.250 --> 01:18:45.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>based on what I've seen,</v>

1833
01:18:45.021 --> 01:18:46.100
<v Speaker 1>it's most likely will take.</v>

1834
01:18:46.110 --> 01:18:47.760
<v Speaker 1>Decides down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>

<v Speaker 1>rides.</v>

1853
01:19:34.990 --> 01:19:37.510
<v Speaker 1>He actually had another one that he was </v>

1856
01:19:41.750 --> 01:19:44.810
<v Speaker 1>was chasing down another crazy thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that didn't seem to make any sense.</v>

1857
01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:48.650
<v Speaker 1>Let me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me type his name because he had like</v>

1858
01:19:48.651 --> 01:19:53.030
<v Speaker 1>another thing that was like another </v>
<v Speaker 1>theory about something else.</v>

1859
01:19:53.031 --> 01:19:54.320
<v Speaker 1>And then someone on the message board </v>
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>

<v Speaker 1>wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that the rods guy?</v>

1861
01:19:56.930 --> 01:19:58.760
<v Speaker 1>And that's who he is from now on.</v>

1862
01:20:01.080 --> 01:20:02.780
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1863
01:20:04.470 --> 01:20:05.700
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lunar rising.</v>

1864

<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here he goes.</v>

1865
01:20:06.930 --> 01:20:11.380
<v Speaker 1>He's got some shit about the moon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1866
01:20:11.400 --> 01:20:13.980
<v Speaker 1>he thinks there's fucking anomalies on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the moon now.</v>

1867
01:20:14.040 --> 01:20:14.460
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

1868
01:20:14.461 --> 01:20:16.650
<v Speaker 1>Here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the true color of the moon.</v>

1869
01:20:16.890 --> 01:20:19.470
<v Speaker 1>For over 50 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have been told and convinced the moon</v>

1870
01:20:19.471 --> 01:20:23.610
<v Speaker 1>is nothing more than a black and white </v>
<v Speaker 1>desolate rock with moon dust and craters</v>

1871
01:20:23.760 --> 01:20:26.790
<v Speaker 1>that thousands of photos released to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>public have always presented a black and</v>

1872
01:20:26.791 --> 01:20:31.791
<v Speaker 1>white moon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even with the most recent Hubble </v>

1873
01:20:31.791 --> 01:20:31.800
<v Speaker 1>photographs of the moon are black and </v>
<v Speaker 1>white.</v>

1874
01:20:31.830 --> 01:20:36.830
<v Speaker 1>NASA continues to perpetuate the lie </v>
<v Speaker 1>that in quotes that the moon is black </v>

1875
01:20:36.830 --> 01:20:37.710
<v Speaker 1>and white with this mother fucker is </v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>

1876
01:20:39.440 --> 01:20:41.370
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tammy switched over,</v>

1877
01:20:41.770 --> 01:20:42.520
<v Speaker 3>switched over</v>

1878
01:20:43.860 --> 01:20:46.070
<v Speaker 1>bunch of spots that he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

1879
01:20:46.071 --> 01:20:51.071
<v Speaker 1>this is hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is they believe that the moon landing </v>

1880
01:20:51.071 --> 01:20:51.071
<v Speaker 1>was a hoax.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh knows he's.</v>

1881
01:20:51.071 --> 01:20:55.201
<v Speaker 1>What he's showing is craters and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>believes that these craters are </v>

1882
01:20:55.201 --> 01:20:58.460
<v Speaker 1>different alien artifacts and these </v>
<v Speaker 1>craters like,</v>

1883
01:20:58.520 --> 01:20:59.990
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's such a stretch.</v>

1884
01:21:00.260 --> 01:21:05.260
<v Speaker 1>Like the photos are such a stretch is </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinks that these structures are </v>

1885
01:21:05.260 --> 01:21:05.840
<v Speaker 1>artificial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like fucking craters,</v>

1886
01:21:05.841 --> 01:21:08.600
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shit got smashed by rocks from space.</v>

1887
01:21:08.830 --> 01:21:13.830
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes a little shapes come out of </v>

1888
01:21:13.830 --> 01:21:13.830
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You fucking dummy.</v>

1889
01:21:13.830 --> 01:21:16.090
<v Speaker 3>Did you say the moon on Conan set last </v>
<v Speaker 3>night on his first episode.</v>

1890
01:21:16.091 --> 01:21:17.590
<v Speaker 3>How was the first episode?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you watch it?</v>

1891
01:21:17.591 --> 01:21:19.580
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it felt really cheap,</v>

1892
01:21:19.730 --> 01:21:22.010
<v Speaker 3>like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how you watch the NBC show.</v>

1893
01:21:22.020 --> 01:21:27.020
<v Speaker 3>It felt like the furniture was high </v>
<v Speaker 3>quality if felt like those were real </v>

1894
01:21:27.020 --> 01:21:28.010
<v Speaker 3>plants behind them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It felt like a good backdrop.</v>

1895
01:21:28.310 --> 01:21:32.990
<v Speaker 3>This felt like they got everything at </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking sears outlet,</v>

1896
01:21:32.991 --> 01:21:33.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1897
01:21:34.310 --> 01:21:39.310
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and in the background was this horrible </v>

1898
01:21:39.310 --> 01:21:40.160
<v Speaker 3>blue painting that just looked really </v>
<v Speaker 3>cheap and generic.</v>

1899
01:21:40.161 --> 01:21:43.190
<v Speaker 3>And then there was this moon in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>middle of it that was kind of cool and I</v>

1900
01:21:43.191 --> 01:21:44.870
<v Speaker 3>guess it moves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it moves,</v>

1901
01:21:45.200 --> 01:21:50.200
<v Speaker 3>but it just looked like the whole thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>look like low budget and it wasn't the </v>

1902
01:21:50.200 --> 01:21:53.500
<v Speaker 3>real moon or fake fake man or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it just look really low budget and I</v>

1903
01:21:53.501 --> 01:21:54.560
<v Speaker 3>don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was okay.</v>

1904
01:21:54.561 --> 01:21:59.561
<v Speaker 3>He had seth rogen on left side and </v>
<v Speaker 3>listen how gay you are you looking at </v>

1905
01:21:59.561 --> 01:22:02.620
<v Speaker 3>the set of control as a fan?</v>

1906
01:22:02.950 --> 01:22:04.900
<v Speaker 3>I was a fan of the show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was a role.</v>

1907
01:22:05.770 --> 01:22:10.770
<v Speaker 3>Was it a real moon or fake news?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't comment on the furniture.</v>

1908
01:22:11.070 --> 01:22:13.940
<v Speaker 3>It was a real fan of the show in a lot </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the reviewers of that,</v>

1909
01:22:13.941 --> 01:22:16.250
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like newspapers and stuff that reviewed,</v>

1910
01:22:16.310 --> 01:22:17.470
<v Speaker 3>reviewed it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1911
01:22:17.500 --> 01:22:19.250
<v Speaker 3>they made up an interesting point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1912
01:22:19.251 --> 01:22:24.251
<v Speaker 3>why are you focusing on a 10th of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>variation of the tonight show?</v>

1913
01:22:24.500 --> 01:22:26.150
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you're not being your own show.</v>

1914
01:22:26.151 --> 01:22:28.760
<v Speaker 3>You're being like the tonight show in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>version of the tonight show.</v>

1915
01:22:28.910 --> 01:22:33.910
<v Speaker 3>You have this new opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why don't you fucking throw that desk </v>

1916
01:22:33.910 --> 01:22:33.910
<v Speaker 3>out a window and fucking do something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1917
01:22:34.730 --> 01:22:39.730
<v Speaker 3>people like that desk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that funny that you liked having </v>

1918
01:22:39.730 --> 01:22:40.180
<v Speaker 3>people on it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isn't it better to do it like this way?</v>

1919
01:22:40.200 --> 01:22:42.210
<v Speaker 3>Just like this is like if we were here </v>
<v Speaker 3>or.</v>

1920
01:22:42.210 --> 01:22:44.600
<v Speaker 3>I mean we have a table so we have our </v>
<v Speaker 3>laptops and shit in front of us,</v>

1921
01:22:44.601 --> 01:22:47.430
<v Speaker 3>but I do have kind of a desto yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's to put shit on that.</v>

1922
01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:48.990
<v Speaker 3>They don't see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't see the dose.</v>

1923
01:22:49.670 --> 01:22:51.640
<v Speaker 3>There's always a pencil and a piece of </v>
<v Speaker 3>paper now.</v>

1924
01:22:52.340 --> 01:22:55.430
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But our viewers don't see the deaths.</v>

1925
01:22:55.490 --> 01:22:56.090
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he.</v>

1926
01:22:56.091 --> 01:22:57.860
<v Speaker 3>I guess it's cool that he has notes and </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>

1927
01:22:57.870 --> 01:22:59.270
<v Speaker 3>What they could put that on a </v>
<v Speaker 3>teleprompter.</v>

1928
01:22:59.300 --> 01:23:02.330
<v Speaker 3>I think there's some security to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>desk because it's been there forever.</v>

1929
01:23:02.500 --> 01:23:05.810
<v Speaker 3>Just because you get boners when Pamela </v>
<v Speaker 3>Anderson from years ago was on.</v>

1930
01:23:05.950 --> 01:23:06.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't.</v>

1931
01:23:06.520 --> 01:23:11.520
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't look cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get nervous when you're seeing </v>

1932
01:23:11.520 --> 01:23:14.680
<v Speaker 1>Pamela.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna let you sit there on stage.</v>

1933
01:23:16.581 --> 01:23:21.581
<v Speaker 1>No desk and they're on a big lazy boy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just got a headset on and you don't want</v>

1934
01:23:22.881 --> 01:23:27.881
<v Speaker 1>to be too lazy though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just in the conversation will be </v>

01:24:25.660 --> 01:24:29.570
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's sitting there by himself in </v>
<v Speaker 1>front of a laptop and then that could be</v>

1965
01:24:29.870 --> 01:24:34.490
<v Speaker 1>fucking the whole world listening and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you could hear all their laughter.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

1967
01:24:35.920 --> 01:24:39.560
<v Speaker 1>You have a stereo system and as well he </v>
<v Speaker 1>said it's really crazy because you could</v>

1968
01:24:39.561 --> 01:24:42.950
<v Speaker 1>see when you set it up you can see all </v>
<v Speaker 1>these people in front of you,</v>

1969
01:24:43.260 --> 01:24:45.710
<v Speaker 1>like you see them sitting like there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>not just one screen.</v>

1970
01:24:45.711 --> 01:24:50.711
<v Speaker 1>It was like a dozen screens in front of </v>
<v Speaker 1>him and he sees all these people in </v>

1971
01:24:50.711 --> 01:24:50.711
<v Speaker 1>front of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's almost like an audience.</v>

1972
01:24:51.560 --> 01:24:54.890
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the shower ring convention.</v>

1973
01:24:56.030 --> 01:24:58.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not real interested in talk shows.</v>

1974
01:24:58.460 --> 01:25:00.410
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when I'd heard about it I was like,</v>

1975
01:25:00.411 --> 01:25:05.411
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to really watch it like a </v>

1976
01:25:05.411 --> 01:25:07.091
<v Speaker 1>podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not because it's seven minutes </v>

1977
01:25:07.091 --> 01:25:07.091
<v Speaker 1>and all they're doing is talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>their moves.</v>

1978
01:25:07.330 --> 01:25:08.510
<v Speaker 1>They're talking about there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1979
01:25:08.511 --> 01:25:10.820
<v Speaker 1>how often does someone have a really </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting story?</v>

1980
01:25:11.300 --> 01:25:13.640
<v Speaker 1>It's not usually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of the time they just pimping their</v>

1981
01:25:13.641 --> 01:25:14.210
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1982
01:25:14.211 --> 01:25:15.230
<v Speaker 1>They'll have a little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1983
01:25:15.231 --> 01:25:17.960
<v Speaker 1>so what's been going on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We recently had our second baby.</v>

1984
01:25:18.180 --> 01:25:23.180
<v Speaker 3>To me it's good because you lay in bed </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're kind of like watching the </v>

1985
01:25:23.180 --> 01:25:26.371
<v Speaker 3>news kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like the news but mixed with humor </v>

1986
01:25:26.371 --> 01:25:27.190
<v Speaker 3>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's kind of more just like,</v>

1987
01:25:27.220 --> 01:25:29.530
<v Speaker 3>it's like I wouldn't watch it if it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>like 8:00</v>

1988
01:25:29.530 --> 01:25:29.530
<v Speaker 3>PM.</v>

1989
01:25:29.720 --> 01:25:31.040
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1990
01:25:31.041 --> 01:25:32.600
<v Speaker 1>I like them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're okay,</v>

1991
01:25:32.601 --> 01:25:34.430
<v Speaker 1>but I don't go out of my way to see him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I prefer,</v>

1992
01:25:34.850 --> 01:25:36.590
<v Speaker 1>I prefer the Jon Stewart show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Honestly.</v>

1993
01:25:36.591 --> 01:25:40.070
<v Speaker 1>I think that the daily show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way he does it is the best way.</v>

1994
01:25:40.100 --> 01:25:42.830
<v Speaker 1>He has a lot of shit that he fucks </v>
<v Speaker 1>around with like his,</v>

1995
01:25:43.070 --> 01:25:45.980
<v Speaker 1>his monologues and his megan front of </v>
<v Speaker 1>things in the news.</v>

1996
01:25:45.981 --> 01:25:47.870
<v Speaker 1>Even though it's all political for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>most part.</v>

1997
01:25:48.050 --> 01:25:53.050
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he hit the mark more than </v>

1998
01:25:53.050 --> 01:25:54.881
<v Speaker 1>anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He makes me laugh out loud more than </v>

1999
01:25:54.881 --> 01:25:57.650
<v Speaker 1>anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guys already talk about the Golfer </v>

2000
01:25:57.650 --> 01:25:59.200
<v Speaker 1>granicus weed smoking incident on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jon Stewart show?</v>

2001
01:25:59.250 --> 01:26:00.880
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Didn't know what happened.</v>

2002
01:26:00.881 --> 01:26:01.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2003
01:26:01.340 --> 01:26:03.110
<v Speaker 1>He smoked pot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He pulled out a giant.</v>

2004
01:26:03.350 --> 01:26:04.100
<v Speaker 1>Was actually</v>

2005
01:26:04.100 --> 01:26:08.260
<v Speaker 4>the bill Maher show was a dumpster?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

2006
01:26:09.040 --> 01:26:10.670
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was real time.</v>

2007
01:26:10.910 --> 01:26:15.910
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the executive said that it wasn't real </v>

2008
01:26:15.910 --> 01:26:16.720
<v Speaker 4>pot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was a prop they had to say.</v>

2009
01:26:17.060 --> 01:26:18.380
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But why do they have to say?</v>

2010
01:26:19.010 --> 01:26:22.840
<v Speaker 4>Why do they have to say it's not real?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who the kids were,</v>

2011
01:26:22.850 --> 01:26:27.850
<v Speaker 4>this is the first podcast we've done </v>
<v Speaker 4>since proposition nine did not pass 19 </v>

2012
01:26:27.850 --> 01:26:28.310
<v Speaker 4>rather did not pass,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2013
01:26:28.370 --> 01:26:33.370
<v Speaker 4>and so there's a lot of fucking tears,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of shit going on right now in this</v>

2014
01:26:33.531 --> 01:26:38.531
<v Speaker 4>country.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of shit going on with pot </v>

2015
01:26:38.531 --> 01:26:38.660
<v Speaker 4>and disinformation and people thinking </v>
<v Speaker 4>that somehow or another,</v>

2016
01:26:38.960 --> 01:26:42.440
<v Speaker 4>if you don't have pot and it's more </v>
<v Speaker 4>accessible than it is now,</v>

2017
01:26:42.441 --> 01:26:45.110
<v Speaker 4>that the world's going to fall apart.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's sad.</v>

2018
01:26:45.140 --> 01:26:50.140
<v Speaker 4>I never thought when I was a little kid </v>
<v Speaker 4>that we'd be here and now 2010 and this </v>

2019
01:26:50.140 --> 01:26:51.080
<v Speaker 4>would still be up for debate.</v>

2020
01:26:51.520 --> 01:26:56.520
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you also know that it's never going </v>

2021
01:26:56.520 --> 01:26:59.051
<v Speaker 4>to pay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not going to pass that easily and </v>

2022
01:26:59.051 --> 01:26:59.051
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>unless it's like an iphone app,</v>

2023
01:26:59.051 --> 01:27:02.381
<v Speaker 4>one single button,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all these people instead of having to </v>

2024
01:27:02.381 --> 01:27:04.610
<v Speaker 4>register and then go get fucking take </v>
<v Speaker 4>off work or go towards your lunch and we</v>

2025
01:27:04.720 --> 01:27:06.350
<v Speaker 4>do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Otherwise would be too much fraud.</v>

2026
01:27:06.370 --> 01:27:07.280
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

2027
01:27:07.281 --> 01:27:08.960
<v Speaker 4>in 10 years they're going to figure it </v>
<v Speaker 4>out.</v>

2028
01:27:08.961 --> 01:27:11.240
<v Speaker 4>It's going to be on your fucking pagers </v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe.</v>

2029
01:27:11.270 --> 01:27:15.400
<v Speaker 4>But maybe there's probably some </v>
<v Speaker 4>incentive to keep it complicated because</v>

2030
01:27:15.410 --> 01:27:18.230
<v Speaker 4>the more complicated,</v>
<v Speaker 4>absolutely less people vote and the more</v>

2031
01:27:18.380 --> 01:27:23.380
<v Speaker 4>it's political aficionados that are in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the mix instead of just the casual </v>

2032
01:27:23.380 --> 01:27:25.100
<v Speaker 4>person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I knew that was going to happen now.</v>

2033
01:27:25.150 --> 01:27:26.660
<v Speaker 4>Did you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wasn't shocked at all.</v>

2034
01:27:26.680 --> 01:27:28.100
<v Speaker 4>It was just like gay marriage,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2035
01:27:28.110 --> 01:27:31.130
<v Speaker 4>you thought that was gonna pass.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But then you know what's shocking to me,</v>

2036
01:27:31.131 --> 01:27:32.570
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He loves jujitsu and he treats treated </v>

2084
01:29:37.200 --> 01:29:37.620
<v Speaker 1>practice.</v>

2085
01:29:37.621 --> 01:29:40.890
<v Speaker 1>And someone who's a chess genius.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that kind of a mind,</v>

<v Speaker 1>to jujitsu.</v>

2089
01:29:52.170 --> 01:29:53.190
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet.</v>

2090
01:29:53.630 --> 01:29:58.500
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you were making free money </v>
<v Speaker 1>just like 20 k a month,</v>

2091
01:29:58.530 --> 01:30:01.740
<v Speaker 1>which is probably in the area doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing,</v>

2092
01:30:01.741 --> 01:30:06.741
<v Speaker 1>why would you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in my money does flow in the </v>

<v Speaker 1>He doesn't need to.</v>

2095
01:30:06.741 --> 01:30:10.080
<v Speaker 1>You can just stick to being the greatest</v>
<v Speaker 1>jujitsu player of all time.</v>

2096
01:30:10.100 --> 01:30:15.100
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would love to see just professional </v>

2097
01:30:15.100 --> 01:30:15.100
<v Speaker 1>jujitsu because I've always said that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2098
01:30:15.100 --> 01:30:19.460
<v Speaker 1>one of the best things about jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Washington u two is you don't have any </v>

2099
01:30:19.460 --> 01:30:20.970
<v Speaker 1>guilt even though you're watching dudes </v>
<v Speaker 1>get jacked and even if you jacker guy,</v>

2100
01:30:21.210 --> 01:30:26.210
<v Speaker 1>there's no guilt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's because like when you knock </v>

2101
01:30:26.210 --> 01:30:26.210
<v Speaker 1>somebody out or you hurt somebody or </v>
<v Speaker 1>even watched someone get knocked out,</v>

2102
01:30:26.430 --> 01:30:29.280
<v Speaker 1>at least part of my brain is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy just got fucked up.</v>

2103
01:30:29.310 --> 01:30:34.310
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a part of that god is not going </v>

2104
01:30:34.310 --> 01:30:35.991
<v Speaker 1>to be the same again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like he got hit by a car when </v>

2105
01:30:35.991 --> 01:30:36.360
<v Speaker 1>someone gets really fucking head kicked </v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

2106
01:30:36.361 --> 01:30:39.030
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when gonzaga cro copped procop,</v>

2107
01:30:39.240 --> 01:30:40.950
<v Speaker 1>when he had kicked broke up and knocked </v>
<v Speaker 1>them out.</v>

2108
01:30:41.070 --> 01:30:45.210
<v Speaker 1>I remember I had an interview cop </v>
<v Speaker 1>afterwards and he was just reallY,</v>

2109
01:30:45.260 --> 01:30:48.330
<v Speaker 1>it was a dumb idea to interview him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sHould've probably protested,</v>

2110
01:30:48.480 --> 01:30:50.880
<v Speaker 1>but we always interview the winner and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the loser and he was up and they said,</v>

2111
01:30:50.881 --> 01:30:51.840
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>interview the loser.</v>

2112
01:30:51.990 --> 01:30:54.600
<v Speaker 1>So I just automatically went to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But as I was talking to him,</v>

2113
01:30:54.601 --> 01:30:59.601
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this poor guy should not be getting </v>

2114
01:30:59.601 --> 01:30:59.601
<v Speaker 1>interviewed right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy just.</v>

2115
01:30:59.601 --> 01:31:00.880
<v Speaker 1>He just got knocked unconscious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not exactly sure what happened.</v>

2116
01:31:00.881 --> 01:31:02.850
<v Speaker 1>And I'm asking them questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2117
01:31:02.851 --> 01:31:04.170
<v Speaker 1>when you see something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2118
01:31:04.171 --> 01:31:04.830
<v Speaker 1>you go,</v>

2120
01:31:07.440 --> 01:31:08.970
<v Speaker 1>Which jujitsu never feels like there's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>price,</v>

2121
01:31:09.260 --> 01:31:14.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys get jacked and even if they get </v>

2122
01:31:14.260 --> 01:31:15.891
<v Speaker 1>hurt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he's going to be okay and most of </v>

2123
01:31:15.891 --> 01:31:15.891
<v Speaker 1>the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>99 percent of the time.</v>

2124
01:31:15.891 --> 01:31:20.090

2126
01:31:20.490 --> 01:31:25.490
<v Speaker 1>you could have professional jujitsu and </v>
<v Speaker 1>even put it on tv and it would be </v>

2127
01:31:25.490 --> 01:31:26.640
<v Speaker 1>exciting because he'd be just catching </v>
<v Speaker 1>people all the time.</v>

2128

<v Speaker 1>There's no reason why no good jujitsu </v>

01:31:53.781 --> 01:31:57.540
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't be in the olympics is a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>too slow for people that does that,</v>

<v Speaker 1>that board.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2138
01:32:01.991 --> 01:32:06.991
<v Speaker 2>That's one that I was always the guy in </v>
<v Speaker 2>class that asked the questions about </v>

2139
01:32:07.300 --> 01:32:12.300
<v Speaker 2>yanking on colors and yanking on sleeves</v>

<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2141
01:32:12.850 --> 01:32:13.930
<v Speaker 2>because I was embarrassed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>

2142
01:32:14.050 --> 01:32:16.180
<v Speaker 2>WHen I first started doing jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would tell guys,</v>

2143
01:32:16.330 --> 01:32:17.740
<v Speaker 2>check,</v>
<v Speaker 2>check out this next slide.</v>

2144
01:32:17.741 --> 01:32:18.960
<v Speaker 2>This guy's a jujitsu guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's gonna.</v>

2145
01:32:19.060 --> 01:32:20.350
<v Speaker 2>Fuck him up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's going to jack him.</v>

2146
01:32:20.590 --> 01:32:25.590
<v Speaker 2>And the first fight that I got really </v>
<v Speaker 2>disappointed with was a bustamante </v>

2147
01:32:25.590 --> 01:32:27.130
<v Speaker 2>against blender.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love bustamante to death.</v>

2148
01:32:27.131 --> 01:32:29.020
<v Speaker 2>He's still one of my all time favorite </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighters,</v>

2149
01:32:29.021 --> 01:32:32.560
<v Speaker 2>but I couldn't believe that he couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>finish them off his back.</v>

2150
01:32:32.920 --> 01:32:34.900
<v Speaker 2>It was just baffled me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kept saying,</v>

2151
01:32:34.901 --> 01:32:39.901
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's going to get them right and he's </v>

2152
01:32:39.901 --> 01:32:39.901
<v Speaker 2>going to get him on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's just setting him up.</v>

2153
01:32:39.901 --> 01:32:39.901
<v Speaker 2>He's going to get them and then it </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't happen and I asked sean,</v>

2154
01:32:40.050 --> 01:32:45.050
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's going on with how come we never </v>

2155
01:32:45.050 --> 01:32:45.050
<v Speaker 2>see sweeps and finishes off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2156
01:32:45.050 --> 01:32:47.140
<v Speaker 2>rarely off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>off from the bottom,</v>

2157
01:32:47.141 --> 01:32:50.680
<v Speaker 2>you'd never see sweeps and finishes at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the same rate as you Do at the moon.</v>

2158
01:32:50.690 --> 01:32:52.990
<v Speaker 2>Dealz at the moon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Als are sweeping their,</v>

2159
01:32:52.991 --> 01:32:54.810
<v Speaker 2>finishing off their back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2160
01:32:54.940 --> 01:32:58.390
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's incredible how much action there is</v>

2161
01:32:58.391 --> 01:33:00.040
<v Speaker 2>like off your back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not an mma.</v>

2162
01:33:00.340 --> 01:33:05.340
<v Speaker 2>It was different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's because they don't have to hold </v>

2163
01:33:05.340 --> 01:33:05.340
<v Speaker 2>onto.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2164
01:33:05.340 --> 01:33:06.730
<v Speaker 2>Well if you practice setting up all your</v>
<v Speaker 2>submissions and sweeps,</v>

2165
01:33:06.940 --> 01:33:10.660
<v Speaker 2>yanking and pulling on someone's outfit </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's actually part of the sweep.</v>

2166
01:33:10.810 --> 01:33:14.350
<v Speaker 2>You take that out and then you also add </v>
<v Speaker 2>strikes.</v>

2167
01:33:14.650 --> 01:33:15.550
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just,</v>

2168
01:33:15.551 --> 01:33:17.650
<v Speaker 2>it's a whole different game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2169
01:33:17.651 --> 01:33:19.450
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2170
01:33:20.380 --> 01:33:24.300
<v Speaker 2>what was the question?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How did we get this talking about john?</v>

2171
01:33:24.350 --> 01:33:27.930
<v Speaker 2>Jack watching matches with you and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>guys were both saying how boring.</v>

2172
01:33:27.970 --> 01:33:28.840
<v Speaker 2>Oh yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2173
01:33:28.880 --> 01:33:33.880
<v Speaker 2>I always,</v>
<v Speaker 2>immediately I was questioning the </v>

2174
01:33:33.880 --> 01:33:33.880
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

2175
01:33:33.880 --> 01:33:34.030
<v Speaker 2>this could be a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is makinG jujitsu look bad.</v>

2176
01:33:34.031 --> 01:33:37.960
<v Speaker 2>Like for me it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how Does jujitsu and mma and then when I</v>

2177
01:33:37.961 --> 01:33:42.961
<v Speaker 2>went to the moon deals in 2000 as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>purple belt with jacques and we're </v>

2178
01:33:42.961 --> 01:33:46.840
<v Speaker 2>watching the black belts and like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't even keep my eyes open there.</v>

2179
01:33:46.890 --> 01:33:49.540
<v Speaker 2>It's just so it just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most of tHe matches,</v>

2180
01:33:49.541 --> 01:33:52.940
<v Speaker 2>one born there were some exciting magic </v>
<v Speaker 2>and there still are some vr.</v>

2181
01:33:53.050 --> 01:33:54.820
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of exciting matches with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the gooey,</v>

2182
01:33:55.120 --> 01:33:57.030
<v Speaker 2>but generally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we,</v>

2183
01:33:57.220 --> 01:34:02.220
<v Speaker 2>I was sitting there trying to keep my </v>
<v Speaker 2>eyes open and john jack looked over and </v>

2184
01:34:02.220 --> 01:34:02.220
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

2185
01:34:02.220 --> 01:34:03.730
<v Speaker 2>this is so boring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wanted to leave.</v>

2186
01:34:04.120 --> 01:34:09.120
<v Speaker 2>And right there that struck them like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>damn one of the fucking baddest jujitsu </v>

2187
01:34:09.120 --> 01:34:14.071
<v Speaker 2>players of all time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My master is bored with watching black </v>

2188
01:34:14.071 --> 01:34:14.130
<v Speaker 2>belts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2189
01:34:14.200 --> 01:34:17.230
<v Speaker 2>played tug of war and the gi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's when I thought,</v>

2190
01:34:17.231 --> 01:34:20.320
<v Speaker 2>whoa man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're the key is a problem.</v>

2191
01:34:20.321 --> 01:34:25.321
<v Speaker 2>And for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reason why I started teaching </v>

2192
01:34:25.321 --> 01:34:25.810
<v Speaker 2>without the g wasn't to separate myself </v>
<v Speaker 2>from Brazil,</v>

2193
01:34:26.010 --> 01:34:27.640
<v Speaker 2>the brazilian jujitsu community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't,</v>

2194
01:34:27.860 --> 01:34:29.620
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't me going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck you,</v>

2195
01:34:29.940 --> 01:34:31.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you guys went the ge.</v>

2196
01:34:31.450 --> 01:34:35.760
<v Speaker 2>I took off the g for jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did this shit for jujitsu and I,</v>

2197
01:34:36.030 --> 01:34:37.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the one thing I want everybody.</v>

2198
01:34:37.810 --> 01:34:42.810
<v Speaker 2>I want everyone to understand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially the brazilians that hate me </v>

2199
01:34:42.810 --> 01:34:45.870
<v Speaker 2>is I did this for jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The most important thing for me is how </v>

2200
01:34:45.870 --> 01:34:48.840
<v Speaker 2>would you jitsu looks and nma and I feel</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the key is a problem for mma.</v>

2201
01:34:49.300 --> 01:34:51.670
<v Speaker 2>So I decided when I opened up the </v>
<v Speaker 2>school,</v>

2202
01:34:51.790 --> 01:34:54.010
<v Speaker 2>I want to try to bring jujitsu back of </v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

2203
01:34:54.011 --> 01:34:59.011
<v Speaker 2>do whatever I can personally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever I can do to bring jujitsu back </v>

2204
01:34:59.011 --> 01:34:59.011
<v Speaker 2>in</v>

2205
01:34:59.011 --> 01:34:59.011
<v Speaker 1>mma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2206
01:34:59.011 --> 01:35:02.030
<v Speaker 1>you did it also because you think that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most effective way to do it in mma?</v>

2207
01:35:02.090 --> 01:35:02.480
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

2208
01:35:02.481 --> 01:35:03.140
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

2209
01:35:03.141 --> 01:35:08.141
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was the most effective way </v>

2210
01:35:08.141 --> 01:35:08.750
<v Speaker 1>and I'm doing it for jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel that if everyone lost the ge,</v>

2211
01:35:09.120 --> 01:35:14.120
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 years ago and just focused on no </v>

2212
01:35:14.120 --> 01:35:14.870
<v Speaker 1>geese submissions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>setting up everything in the clench,</v>

2213
01:35:14.900 --> 01:35:19.900
<v Speaker 1>setting everything up with over hooks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>under hooks and had to control as </v>

2214
01:35:19.900 --> 01:35:21.140
<v Speaker 1>opposed to setting everything up with </v>
<v Speaker 1>yanking and pooling collars and sleeves.</v>

2215
01:35:21.290 --> 01:35:23.390
<v Speaker 1>If we would've started everybody 10 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago,</v>

2216
01:35:23.391 --> 01:35:25.100
<v Speaker 1>we just killed the g of heleo would've </v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

2217
01:35:25.250 --> 01:35:27.080
<v Speaker 1>no more gate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We we need to come back.</v>

2218
01:35:27.081 --> 01:35:29.660
<v Speaker 1>We need to dominate nma again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2219
01:35:29.661 --> 01:35:31.700
<v Speaker 1>The world would be a different place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We would see.</v>

2220
01:35:32.460 --> 01:35:37.460
<v Speaker 1>We would see 100 shinya aoki,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a hundred havi vasquez.</v>

2221
01:35:37.520 --> 01:35:39.350
<v Speaker 1>Did you see when Ryan Hall said </v>
<v Speaker 1>recently,</v>

2222
01:35:39.351 --> 01:35:41.690
<v Speaker 1>you know a thing about how he doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>play garden anymore.</v>

2223
01:35:41.900 --> 01:35:45.140
<v Speaker 1>That always concerned with now is if he </v>
<v Speaker 1>winds up on bottom,</v>

2224
01:35:45.141 --> 01:35:46.940
<v Speaker 1>is sweeping,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting on top to finish.</v>

2225
01:35:47.480 --> 01:35:48.950
<v Speaker 1>That's beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you could do it,</v>

2226
01:35:48.951 --> 01:35:50.360
<v Speaker 1>but what about the guys?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't sweep.</v>

2227
01:35:50.460 --> 01:35:51.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's saying that you can't.</v>

2228
01:35:52.090 --> 01:35:57.090
<v Speaker 1>He's saying that you can't rely on your </v>
<v Speaker 1>garden anymore when you can't rely on </v>

2229
01:35:57.090 --> 01:36:00.221
<v Speaker 1>sweeps all the time either,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're going to be on your back </v>

2230
01:36:00.221 --> 01:36:00.221
<v Speaker 1>regardless and if you could sweep them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm.</v>

2231
01:36:00.221 --> 01:36:05.080
<v Speaker 1>Most of mY game is all about sweets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm all about sweeping and getting on </v>

2232
01:36:05.080 --> 01:36:08.201
<v Speaker 1>top,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have to prepare for the worst </v>

2233
01:36:08.201 --> 01:36:10.331
<v Speaker 1>case scenario.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A guy That puts on your back and you </v>

2234
01:36:10.331 --> 01:36:12.371
<v Speaker 1>can't sweep them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You better have a wicked finishing game </v>

2235
01:36:12.371 --> 01:36:12.470
<v Speaker 1>off your back as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to have both.</v>

2236
01:36:12.590 --> 01:36:16.220
<v Speaker 1>You can't finish everybody from your </v>
<v Speaker 1>back and you can't sweep everybody,</v>

2237
01:36:16.460 --> 01:36:20.000
<v Speaker 1>but if a dude stuff's just all your </v>
<v Speaker 1>sweeps and he stuffs all your finishes,</v>

2238
01:36:20.090 --> 01:36:21.200
<v Speaker 1>he's just better than you.</v>

2239
01:36:21.350 --> 01:36:22.270
<v Speaker 1>That's it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2240
01:36:22.340 --> 01:36:24.260
<v Speaker 1>but you got to have as much game as </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>

2241
01:36:24.261 --> 01:36:29.261
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody hasn't stepped up and tried to </v>

2242
01:36:29.261 --> 01:36:29.261
<v Speaker 1>make a professional jujitsu league,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2243
01:36:29.261 --> 01:36:30.800
<v Speaker 1>I know reconciler really did that thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a little bit,</v>

2244
01:36:30.801 --> 01:36:31.670
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>

2245
01:36:32.060 --> 01:36:33.730
<v Speaker 1>he was having a hard time with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think.</v>

2246
01:36:33.940 --> 01:36:35.810
<v Speaker 1>I think it's more popular now than it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was then.</v>

2247
01:36:36.050 --> 01:36:38.120
<v Speaker 1>The problem with the ricoh temporarily </v>
<v Speaker 1>promotion,</v>

2248
01:36:38.121 --> 01:36:40.460
<v Speaker 1>which was professional submission league</v>
<v Speaker 1>psl,</v>

2249
01:36:40.850 --> 01:36:45.850
<v Speaker 1>great concept.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just had like eight superfight </v>

2250
01:36:45.850 --> 01:36:45.850
<v Speaker 1>matches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

2251
01:36:45.850 --> 01:36:45.850
<v Speaker 1>He had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had marcello and they're against.</v>

2252
01:36:45.850 --> 01:36:47.420
<v Speaker 1>Jake shields had marcello and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>against cameron earl.</v>

2253
01:36:47.780 --> 01:36:52.780
<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was the only way he thought he </v>

2254
01:36:52.780 --> 01:36:52.780
<v Speaker 1>could make it work and sell it to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>network or something.</v>

2255
01:36:52.780 --> 01:36:57.761
<v Speaker 1>Even like espn or something was to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>randy couture as the main event and </v>

2256
01:36:58.041 --> 01:37:01.850
<v Speaker 1>randy couture originally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he retired a few years ago and he wasn't</v>

2257
01:37:01.851 --> 01:37:03.260
<v Speaker 1>planning on doing mma anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he,</v>

2258
01:37:03.320 --> 01:37:08.320
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his plan was just to stay in the mix </v>

2259
01:37:08.320 --> 01:37:08.630
<v Speaker 1>competitively and do submission </v>
<v Speaker 1>grappling.</v>

2260
01:37:08.780 --> 01:37:10.490
<v Speaker 1>So rico jumped on and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey dude,</v>

2261
01:37:10.491 --> 01:37:12.080
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be the poster boy to </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

2262
01:37:12.110 --> 01:37:17.110
<v Speaker 1>you're going to blow this up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then when you decided to go back to </v>

2263
01:37:17.110 --> 01:37:18.290
<v Speaker 1>mma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was left without a poster child.</v>

2264
01:37:18.291 --> 01:37:19.220
<v Speaker 1>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

2265
01:37:19.280 --> 01:37:22.400
<v Speaker 1>I think he could make it successful with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guys we have nowadays,</v>

2266
01:37:22.401 --> 01:37:25.880
<v Speaker 1>like make marcello garcia the poster </v>
<v Speaker 1>child and then bring in,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I don't think you need randy couture.</v>

2273
01:37:41.060 --> 01:37:46.060
<v Speaker 1>I don't think what they really need is </v>
<v Speaker 1>they need to get some sort of a network </v>

2274
01:37:46.060 --> 01:37:49.151
<v Speaker 1>behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone who's willing to step up and </v>

2275
01:37:49.151 --> 01:37:49.151
<v Speaker 1>take a chance with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's hard,</v>

2276
01:37:49.151 --> 01:37:49.151
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2277
01:37:49.151 --> 01:37:51.170
<v Speaker 1>Look at bella [inaudible] bell tours on </v>
<v Speaker 1>like fox sports net.</v>

2278
01:37:51.171 --> 01:37:56.171
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like they have a hard time getting </v>

2279
01:37:56.171 --> 01:37:56.171
<v Speaker 1>a network where people are gonna pay </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention to it.</v>

2280
01:37:56.171 --> 01:37:58.380
<v Speaker 1>If you have jujitsu on fox sports net,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be really tough.</v>

2281
01:37:58.381 --> 01:38:03.381
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's not a lot of people that are </v>

2282
01:38:03.381 --> 01:38:04.551
<v Speaker 1>like focused on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you get it on espn on the other hand </v>

2283
01:38:04.551 --> 01:38:07.761
<v Speaker 1>and made a big deal and the difference,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the difference between submission </v>

2284
01:38:07.761 --> 01:38:10.710
<v Speaker 1>grappling and mma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the the advantage.</v>

2285
01:38:10.711 --> 01:38:13.080
<v Speaker 1>It can be a small advantage in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>people's eyes,</v>

2286
01:38:13.081 --> 01:38:18.081
<v Speaker 1>but people will get into it because </v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody can actually practice it and you</v>

2287
01:38:19.021 --> 01:38:22.380
<v Speaker 1>can go to your local Jujitsu school and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you actually can get involved.</v>

2288
01:38:22.381 --> 01:38:26.740
<v Speaker 1>So and as the potential is there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course it's not.</v>

2289
01:38:26.910 --> 01:38:31.200
<v Speaker 1>It'll never be as exciting as dudes </v>
<v Speaker 1>smashing skulls and and all that kind of</v>

2290
01:38:31.201 --> 01:38:31.530
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

2291
01:38:31.530 --> 01:38:36.530
<v Speaker 1>But a submission,</v>
<v Speaker 1>grappling with the right guys can be </v>

2292
01:38:36.530 --> 01:38:37.620
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very exciting.</v>

2293
01:38:37.621 --> 01:38:42.621
<v Speaker 1>And I hear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it could be successful if they </v>

2294
01:38:42.621 --> 01:38:42.621
<v Speaker 1>got dogs and frisbees at 1:30</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the morning.</v>

2295
01:38:42.660 --> 01:38:45.420
<v Speaker 1>You can throw up some nogi Jujitsu up </v>
<v Speaker 1>there for sure.</v>

2296
01:38:45.421 --> 01:38:49.950
<v Speaker 1>They got the pool is huge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean paul is on tv all the time,</v>

2297
01:38:49.970 --> 01:38:54.870
<v Speaker 1>so to starvIng to death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's on tv barely.</v>

2298
01:38:54.930 --> 01:38:59.930
<v Speaker 1>It's barely on tv.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of those matches that you watch </v>

2299
01:38:59.930 --> 01:39:02.040
<v Speaker 1>old matches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The women have some on espn or there's </v>

2300
01:39:02.040 --> 01:39:05.121
<v Speaker 1>no money in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one's making any money overseas to </v>

2301
01:39:05.121 --> 01:39:09.111
<v Speaker 1>make the real money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ms dot couple tournament's like the us </v>

2302
01:39:09.111 --> 01:39:09.111
<v Speaker 1>open.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You went out,</v>

2303
01:39:09.111 --> 01:39:12.170
<v Speaker 1>you went $40,000,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get to play for a week and that's only </v>

2304
01:39:12.170 --> 01:39:12.170
<v Speaker 1>the winner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2305
01:39:12.170 --> 01:39:12.930
<v Speaker 1>you get down to like the other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's not much.</v>

2306
01:39:14.790 --> 01:39:19.790
<v Speaker 1>There's not much money in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's still on the air and I could </v>

2307
01:39:19.790 --> 01:39:23.251
<v Speaker 1>see submission grappling like that on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the air and no one's really making that </v>

2308
01:39:23.251 --> 01:39:23.251
<v Speaker 1>much money except for the top guys.</v>

2309
01:39:23.251 --> 01:39:24.030
<v Speaker 1>But then you got like poker that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>making money,</v>

2310
01:39:24.031 --> 01:39:26.340
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>who wants his fucking poker?</v>

2311
01:39:26.510 --> 01:39:28.020
<v Speaker 1>the thing about poker is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2312
01:39:28.200 --> 01:39:33.200
<v Speaker 1>the thing about you watch poker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love about her is that you could watch</v>

2313
01:39:34.231 --> 01:39:37.470
<v Speaker 1>and you could know what we all have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when you're watching at home,</v>

2314
01:39:37.680 --> 01:39:39.210
<v Speaker 1>you can't affect the outcome of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>game.</v>

2315
01:39:39.211 --> 01:39:40.950
<v Speaker 1>So you could see like if you had to </v>
<v Speaker 1>aces,</v>

2316
01:39:40.951 --> 01:39:44.580
<v Speaker 1>you had an ace and a king.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could see without you seeing when he</v>

2317
01:39:44.581 --> 01:39:46.680
<v Speaker 1>had the people watching,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could see what he had.</v>

2318
01:39:46.830 --> 01:39:50.220
<v Speaker 1>So they know everyone is in on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how's this gonna play out?</v>

2319
01:39:50.221 --> 01:39:52.470
<v Speaker 1>And it loaded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if facebook is like that?</v>

2320
01:39:52.500 --> 01:39:57.500
<v Speaker 1>Where you knew what the pitcher was </v>
<v Speaker 1>gonna throw like right before they let </v>

2321
01:39:57.500 --> 01:40:01.750
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting because if they let </v>

2322
01:40:01.750 --> 01:40:03.180
<v Speaker 1>you know a second before you throw,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how could he ever get to him?</v>

2323
01:40:03.210 --> 01:40:05.790
<v Speaker 1>How could it get to him that quick and </v>
<v Speaker 1>if he's looking somewhere else,</v>

2324
01:40:05.791 --> 01:40:07.470
<v Speaker 1>he's keeping his eye.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would fuck them up.</v>

2325
01:40:07.500 --> 01:40:09.390
<v Speaker 1>That's a good idea right away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boom.</v>

2326
01:40:09.970 --> 01:40:12.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you had the picture had like a little</v>

2327
01:40:12.601 --> 01:40:14.760
<v Speaker 1>thing on his mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

2328
01:40:14.761 --> 01:40:19.761
<v Speaker 1>It would have to be someone who could </v>
<v Speaker 1>read the signs because the catcher is </v>

2329
01:40:19.761 --> 01:40:22.701
<v Speaker 1>giving those signs or just do it like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>22nd delay because the catcher gives </v>

2330
01:40:22.701 --> 01:40:23.640
<v Speaker 1>those signs with the pitcher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Give those signs.</v>

2331
01:40:23.910 --> 01:40:26.760
<v Speaker 1>Who decides what gets thrown?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think a catcher,</v>

2332
01:40:26.790 --> 01:40:30.330
<v Speaker 1>the picture can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no fucking the pitcher has.</v>

2333
01:40:30.360 --> 01:40:33.390
<v Speaker 1>He's like the executive producer and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>producer,</v>

2334
01:40:33.391 --> 01:40:36.000
<v Speaker 1>but you can have like bitchy arguments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can totally.</v>

2335
01:40:36.090 --> 01:40:38.120
<v Speaker 1>You can see that you see him going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh dude,</v>

2336
01:40:38.180 --> 01:40:38.590
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2337
01:40:38.591 --> 01:40:39.060
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2338
01:40:40.410 --> 01:40:42.780
<v Speaker 1>Basically the catcher trying to get them</v>
<v Speaker 1>to agree like,</v>

2339
01:40:42.781 --> 01:40:43.470
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are we going to do?</v>

2340
01:40:43.471 --> 01:40:45.450
<v Speaker 1>It's up to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you want to throw this.</v>

2341
01:40:45.451 --> 01:40:48.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm just suggesting this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you could do that with football too,</v>

2342
01:40:48.171 --> 01:40:50.310
<v Speaker 1>like uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right before the snap boom.</v>

2343
01:40:50.311 --> 01:40:55.311
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be a run or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dallas is one of the hardest things </v>

2344
01:40:55.311 --> 01:40:55.311
<v Speaker 1>about putting anything together</v>

2345
01:40:55.311 --> 01:40:56.800
<v Speaker 2>is getting two people to agree on what </v>
<v Speaker 2>should be done.</v>

2346
01:40:57.190 --> 01:41:02.190
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you have an executive producer </v>

2347
01:41:02.190 --> 01:41:04.441
<v Speaker 2>and you have the talent and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>together and they're trying to figure </v>

2348
01:41:04.441 --> 01:41:04.441
<v Speaker 2>out how to work things out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

2349
01:41:04.441 --> 01:41:05.740
<v Speaker 2>that's a hard fucking thing to come </v>
<v Speaker 2>together on.</v>

2350
01:41:05.800 --> 01:41:09.110
<v Speaker 2>You'd have to put it on a ten second </v>
<v Speaker 2>delay then that would ensure that no,</v>

2351
01:41:09.140 --> 01:41:10.070
<v Speaker 2>for the baseball thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2352
01:41:10.270 --> 01:41:11.020
<v Speaker 2>if there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2353
01:41:11.290 --> 01:41:12.880
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've had that with music though,</v>

2354
01:41:12.881 --> 01:41:14.080
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've had that with music.</v>

2355
01:41:14.081 --> 01:41:16.340
<v Speaker 2>We're dudes are trying to fuck with your</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit and you didn't like it.</v>

2356
01:41:16.350 --> 01:41:18.460
<v Speaker 2>Remember that executive producer you </v>
<v Speaker 2>were working with for awhile?</v>

2357
01:41:18.760 --> 01:41:20.680
<v Speaker 2>Which one?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The guy down in san diego.</v>

2358
01:41:20.890 --> 01:41:25.890
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where you wanted to do all this and do </v>

2359
01:41:25.890 --> 01:41:25.890
<v Speaker 2>all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

2360
01:41:25.890 --> 01:41:26.770
<v Speaker 2>That wasn't a sudden you'll fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

2361
01:41:26.771 --> 01:41:27.730
<v Speaker 2>I was all time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2362
01:41:27.940 --> 01:41:30.100
<v Speaker 2>I've had it happen with everything I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever done.</v>

2363
01:41:30.130 --> 01:41:32.110
<v Speaker 2>Everything I've ever done that has to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>with creativity.</v>

2364
01:41:32.111 --> 01:41:34.210
<v Speaker 2>That involves other people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They all want to do.</v>

2365
01:41:34.930 --> 01:41:36.280
<v Speaker 2>I am open to hear shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm.</v>

2366
01:41:36.330 --> 01:41:38.590
<v Speaker 2>I've always been that way in every band </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I've been in,</v>

2367
01:41:38.740 --> 01:41:41.770
<v Speaker 2>the rule has always been the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are five of us.</v>

2368
01:41:42.010 --> 01:41:47.010
<v Speaker 2>I'm 22 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's like in their early twenties </v>

2369
01:41:47.010 --> 01:41:48.790
<v Speaker 2>like anybody can write,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we all have to like it.</v>

2370
01:41:49.150 --> 01:41:50.470
<v Speaker 2>Like if you want to come up with </v>
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>

2371
01:41:50.590 --> 01:41:55.590
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We all have to like it because when </v>

2372
01:41:55.590 --> 01:41:55.590
<v Speaker 2>you're on stage man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's most important?</v>

2373
01:41:55.660 --> 01:41:57.850
<v Speaker 2>You would rather play someone else's </v>
<v Speaker 2>good shit.</v>

2374
01:41:58.030 --> 01:42:00.330
<v Speaker 2>Then you're bad shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>

2375
01:42:00.610 --> 01:42:05.610
<v Speaker 2>you don't want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one wants to go on stage and the </v>

2376
01:42:05.610 --> 01:42:05.610
<v Speaker 2>crowd's going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck is this?</v>

2377
01:42:05.610 --> 01:42:07.240
<v Speaker 2>And no one's liking and the other guys </v>
<v Speaker 2>are going to talk behind their back.</v>

2378
01:42:07.241 --> 01:42:07.540
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

2379
01:42:07.541 --> 01:42:08.230
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to do this song.</v>

2380
01:42:08.230 --> 01:42:10.720
<v Speaker 2>And that's the last thing you want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to avoid that.</v>

2381
01:42:11.050 --> 01:42:11.830
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

2382
01:42:11.831 --> 01:42:16.831
<v Speaker 2>So what ends up happening is real quick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you end up gravitating to the guy who's </v>

2383
01:42:16.871 --> 01:42:21.871
<v Speaker 2>putting together the best shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's always a band where you know </v>

2384

<v Speaker 2>that it's that bad.</v>

2413
01:43:20.470 --> 01:43:22.000
<v Speaker 2>It's bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>

01:43:22.001 --> 01:43:23.170
<v Speaker 2>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>

2415
01:43:23.171 --> 01:43:25.930
<v Speaker 2>really bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's not in the in the band anymore,</v>

2416
01:43:25.931 --> 01:43:30.931
<v Speaker 2>but there's a fake peter criss now the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way they did it originally when the </v>

2417
01:43:30.931 --> 01:43:34.860
<v Speaker 2>peter and ace left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they replaced them with new characters </v>

2418
01:43:34.860 --> 01:43:35.860
<v Speaker 2>like Eric Fox came on to replace of as </v>
<v Speaker 2>the fox.</v>

2419
01:43:36.100 --> 01:43:40.180
<v Speaker 2>Vinny vincent came on to replace ace for</v>
<v Speaker 2>the as the egyptian god or something,</v>

2420
01:43:40.510 --> 01:43:42.790
<v Speaker 2>but then then they finally took the </v>
<v Speaker 2>makeup off.</v>

2421
01:43:42.791 --> 01:43:47.791
<v Speaker 2>They went like 10,</v>
<v Speaker 2>15 years without makeup and then when </v>

2422
01:43:47.791 --> 01:43:47.791
<v Speaker 2>they put the makeup back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they got peter and ace,</v>

2423
01:43:47.791 --> 01:43:52.650
<v Speaker 2>the original guys back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They did a couple of reunion tours in </v>

2424
01:43:52.650 --> 01:43:53.030
<v Speaker 2>the exact same thing happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Peter fucked up,</v>

2425
01:43:53.360 --> 01:43:54.530
<v Speaker 2>fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they kicked him out.</v>

2426
01:43:54.740 --> 01:43:56.420
<v Speaker 2>But this time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happened to the fox?</v>

2427
01:43:56.540 --> 01:43:58.020
<v Speaker 2>Where'd that guy go?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He died actually,</v>

2428
01:43:58.040 --> 01:43:58.890

<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2429
01:43:59.210 --> 01:44:00.250
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they,</v>

2430
01:44:00.680 --> 01:44:05.680
<v Speaker 2>when they did the reunion tour,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to bring back the original guys </v>

2431
01:44:05.680 --> 01:44:06.470
<v Speaker 2>because there was two other guys that </v>
<v Speaker 2>were a trigger of this picture.</v>

2432
01:44:07.310 --> 01:44:09.410
<v Speaker 2>It's a really tattooed on this guy's </v>
<v Speaker 2>side.</v>

01:44:09.440 --> 01:44:14.440
<v Speaker 2>He was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was a Bartender or a server at the </v>

<v Speaker 2>And he rented a ace and he was drunk and</v>

2435

<v Speaker 2>he was talking all this shit to ace </v>
<v Speaker 2>Freely and he's feeling.</v>

01:44:25.460 --> 01:44:28.550
<v Speaker 2>fuck you kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's put it up here.</v>

<v Speaker 2>But he got this fucking tattoo of ace </v>
<v Speaker 2>freely tattooed on his whole side of his</v>

2444
01:44:43.340 --> 01:44:46.160
<v Speaker 2>That's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when they decided to do the reunion,</v>

2445
01:44:46.220 --> 01:44:48.110
<v Speaker 2>they got the original guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ace and peter.</v>

2446
01:44:48.111 --> 01:44:49.940
<v Speaker 2>It's been like 15 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course they wanted to do.</v>

2447
01:44:49.941 --> 01:44:51.350
<v Speaker 2>They realized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck we fucked up.</v>

2448
01:44:51.351 --> 01:44:52.460

<v Speaker 2>time?</v>

2450
01:44:54.581 --> 01:44:59.581
<v Speaker 2>It's like both.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They both got back in the reunion tours </v>

2451
01:44:59.581 --> 01:45:00.380
<v Speaker 2>were massive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They did a couple and then peter started</v>

2452
01:45:00.381 --> 01:45:01.790
<v Speaker 2>fucking up at a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Started fucking up.</v>

2453
01:45:01.790 --> 01:45:06.790
<v Speaker 2>Somehow they left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>so instead of getting new guys with new </v>

2454
01:45:06.790 --> 01:45:08.480
<v Speaker 2>characters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they got new guys to play.</v>

2455
01:45:08.550 --> 01:45:10.870
<v Speaker 2>Ace and peter did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they,</v>

2456
01:45:10.920 --> 01:45:14.920
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they kept to the guys and say as no,</v>

2457
01:45:14.990 --> 01:45:16.670
<v Speaker 2>they never did that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They never did.</v>

2458
01:45:17.220 --> 01:45:22.220
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they never pretended like that was the </v>

2459
01:45:22.220 --> 01:45:22.220
<v Speaker 2>real ace.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was the real peter.</v>

2460
01:45:22.220 --> 01:45:24.730
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they did the first few shows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they try to do some shenanigans.</v>

2461
01:45:24.770 --> 01:45:26.210
<v Speaker 2>Not saying that did shenanigans.</v>

<v Speaker 2>They said the real guys name the because</v>

2466
01:45:34.340 --> 01:45:36.590
<v Speaker 2>because what happened is when they did </v>

2474
01:45:56.841 --> 01:46:00.320
<v Speaker 2>He always said he was eric singer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they know that most of the fans that</v>

2480
01:46:09.741 --> 01:46:14.741
<v Speaker 2>They never deny it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they know that it doesn't really </v>

2481
01:46:14.741 --> 01:46:14.741
<v Speaker 2>matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're just going to come up.</v>

2498
01:47:03.450 --> 01:47:05.721
<v Speaker 2>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He can sing fucking harmonies like the </v>

2499
01:47:05.721 --> 01:47:05.721
<v Speaker 2>beatles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>paul and gina machines,</v>

2500
01:47:05.721 --> 01:47:06.810
<v Speaker 2>bro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what they got,</v>

2501
01:47:06.811 --> 01:47:09.090
<v Speaker 2>they were decided to replace eric </v>
<v Speaker 2>singer,</v>

2502
01:47:09.091 --> 01:47:11.190
<v Speaker 2>the old non makeup kiss guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They brought them in.</v>

2503
01:47:11.191 --> 01:47:14.670
<v Speaker 2>They put peter criss makeup on him when </v>
<v Speaker 2>he can and he can sing.</v>

2504
01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.040
<v Speaker 2>Eric singer can sing it and he can play </v>
<v Speaker 2>his ass off.</v>

2505
01:47:17.041 --> 01:47:18.900
<v Speaker 2>He's an amazing drummer and he could </v>
<v Speaker 2>sing.</v>

2506
01:47:18.901 --> 01:47:20.330
<v Speaker 2>So they go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to bring this guy back.</v>

2507
01:47:20.350 --> 01:47:22.480
<v Speaker 2>Does he sing beth now this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

2508
01:47:22.670 --> 01:47:23.400
<v Speaker 2>this is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is.</v>

2509
01:47:23.580 --> 01:47:25.290
<v Speaker 2>They did a reality show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2510
01:47:25.350 --> 01:47:26.520
<v Speaker 2>they did a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The success,</v>

2511
01:47:26.570 --> 01:47:31.570
<v Speaker 2>the gene simmons show was so successful </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they ended up doing it and they </v>

2512
01:47:31.570 --> 01:47:33.090
<v Speaker 2>would show spots of kiss during the gene</v>
<v Speaker 2>simmons reality show,</v>

2513
01:47:33.210 --> 01:47:35.760
<v Speaker 2>but then they kind of did a spinoff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why don't we just follow kiss?</v>

2514
01:47:36.090 --> 01:47:38.550
<v Speaker 2>So reality shows all fucking fake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

2515
01:47:38.760 --> 01:47:42.090
<v Speaker 2>So most they had to make even the ones </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are real,</v>

2516
01:47:42.150 --> 01:47:45.750
<v Speaker 2>the camera that the facial reactions </v>
<v Speaker 2>like they have like one camera there and</v>

2517
01:47:45.751 --> 01:47:47.970
<v Speaker 2>how they're getting honey panning to all</v>
<v Speaker 2>these facial reactions.</v>

2518
01:47:48.140 --> 01:47:51.800
<v Speaker 2>They like storing these facial reactions</v>
<v Speaker 2>from what you know from two weeks ago.</v>

2519
01:47:51.810 --> 01:47:54.660
<v Speaker 2>There's a good one to look.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how they do it different.</v>

2520
01:47:55.570 --> 01:47:56.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how fake it is.</v>

2521
01:47:56.980 --> 01:47:59.430
<v Speaker 2>So with the gene set,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a kiss reality show,</v>

2522
01:47:59.431 --> 01:48:02.430
<v Speaker 2>there was like a mini series wral or it </v>
<v Speaker 2>might be an ongoing show.</v>

2523
01:48:02.490 --> 01:48:07.490
<v Speaker 2>They have to create some drama,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what are their following around and </v>

2524
01:48:07.490 --> 01:48:07.710
<v Speaker 2>eric singer who's dressed like peter is </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2525
01:48:07.830 --> 01:48:11.160

<v Speaker 2>can I do beth in the for the next show?</v>

2526
01:48:11.161 --> 01:48:12.600
<v Speaker 2>And then jeans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all you know,</v>

2527
01:48:12.870 --> 01:48:15.030
<v Speaker 2>a promise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>peter that we wouldn't do beth.</v>

2528
01:48:15.031 --> 01:48:16.920
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>So then eric singer disappears.</v>

2530
01:48:19.620 --> 01:48:21.240
<v Speaker 2>They're about to do a show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where's eric singer?</v>

01:48:21.270 --> 01:48:24.150
<v Speaker 2>We started an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one's been able to find them all.</v>

2532
01:48:24.210 --> 01:48:25.590
<v Speaker 2>They're all looking for uyghur singer.</v>

2616
01:51:40.811 --> 01:51:43.330
<v Speaker 5>Just in the first time we met,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he had just beat someone's ass.</v>

2617
01:51:43.331 --> 01:51:45.010
<v Speaker 5>His lip was all fucked up and it was </v>

<v Speaker 5>he could snap on him.</v>

2625
01:51:56.890 --> 01:51:58.530
<v Speaker 5>He ended up being a super fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>sweetheart.</v>

<v Speaker 5>what was the premise of it?</v>

2628
01:52:03.251 --> 01:52:04.990
<v Speaker 5>I don't even remember.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He got mad about something.</v>

2629
01:52:05.020 --> 01:52:10.020
<v Speaker 5>I don't remember,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I remember as soon as it started </v>

2630
01:52:10.020 --> 01:52:10.020
<v Speaker 5>coming,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as soon as it happened,</v>

2631
01:52:10.020 --> 01:52:10.020
<v Speaker 5>he was screaming.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I turned to the camera,</v>

2632
01:52:10.020 --> 01:52:12.790
<v Speaker 5>went no.</v>
<v Speaker 5>like he was trying to fight you.</v>

2633
01:52:12.840 --> 01:52:13.200
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

<v Speaker 5>I was on the outside.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You and you were trying to keep him for </v>

2636
01:52:20.540 --> 01:52:22.831
<v Speaker 5>getting mad about something and he was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think he was going to start a fight </v>

2637
01:52:22.831 --> 01:52:24.310
<v Speaker 5>with a bouncer or something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was getting nuts with a bouncer and I</v>

2638
01:52:24.311 --> 01:52:25.120
<v Speaker 5>was going,</v>

01:52:27.160 --> 01:52:32.160

<v Speaker 5>but that is a problem if you hang out </v>

2641
01:52:32.160 --> 01:52:34.270
<v Speaker 5>with a certain number of mma fighters.</v>

2647
01:52:46.190 --> 01:52:48.740
<v Speaker 2>Judy Browning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but before I actually met him,</v>

2648
01:52:49.250 --> 01:52:52.940
<v Speaker 2>he was the only guy ever that I saw on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the ultimate fighter and you know,</v>

2649
01:52:52.970 --> 01:52:57.970
<v Speaker 2>we're always backstage running into </v>
<v Speaker 2>these guys all the time and that new </v>

2650
01:52:57.970 --> 01:52:57.970
<v Speaker 2>season comes on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

2651
01:52:57.970 --> 01:53:02.591
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to remember these dudes because I </v>

2652
01:53:02.591 --> 01:53:02.591
<v Speaker 2>want to be running to him all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to not know their names and</v>

2653
01:53:02.591 --> 01:53:04.520
<v Speaker 2>feel like a total douche bag.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm like this.</v>

2654
01:53:04.640 --> 01:53:08.330
<v Speaker 2>I'm like watching the show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>studying their fighting techniques,</v>

2655
01:53:08.480 --> 01:53:11.390
<v Speaker 2>seeing what kind of fighter they are and</v>
<v Speaker 2>what kind of personality they have.</v>

2656
01:53:11.420 --> 01:53:13.160
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they showed joni browning on top.</v>

2657
01:53:13.550 --> 01:53:14.900
<v Speaker 2>I thought to myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

2658
01:53:15.260 --> 01:53:19.370
<v Speaker 2>this guy can snap on anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to get to know this guy.</v>

2659
01:53:20.560 --> 01:53:23.330
<v Speaker 2>I made the decision in my head,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't get close to that guy.</v>

2660
01:53:23.331 --> 01:53:28.331
<v Speaker 2>That guy was holding in las vegas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're eating at nine and he was a really</v>

2661
01:53:28.521 --> 01:53:31.610
<v Speaker 2>nice guy and what happened was it was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>big fan of yours and that's.</v>

2662
01:53:31.820 --> 01:53:33.740
<v Speaker 2>I tried to avoid him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even want to talk to him.</v>

2663
01:53:33.741 --> 01:53:36.410
<v Speaker 2>I just talk from the show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They made him seem like a total lunatic.</v>

2664
01:53:36.411 --> 01:53:38.570
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm in.</v>

2665
01:53:38.571 --> 01:53:43.571
<v Speaker 2>Sean tompkins trained him and he just </v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck somebody up and on spike show in </v>

2666
01:53:43.571 --> 01:53:47.441
<v Speaker 2>vegas and we're at nine the places I see</v>
<v Speaker 2>sean pumpkin's walking towards me and </v>

2667
01:53:47.441 --> 01:53:48.700
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd love sean tompkins.</v>

2668
01:53:48.701 --> 01:53:50.550
<v Speaker 2>So as soon as he came up I like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>we gave each other a little hug and I </v>

2670
01:53:55.670 --> 01:53:55.670

<v Speaker 2>Oh damn.</v>

<v Speaker 2>buddy.</v>

2672
01:53:56.090 --> 01:53:59.210
<v Speaker 2>So I hugged sean tompkins and kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>look the other way,</v>

2673
01:53:59.300 --> 01:54:01.160

<v Speaker 2>any brownie.</v>

<v Speaker 5>that everyone has an ego.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have an ego.</v>

2745
01:56:38.360 --> 01:56:41.430
<v Speaker 5>that ego in check because if I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if I'm not consciously trying to keep it</v>

2746
01:56:41.431 --> 01:56:44.430
<v Speaker 5>in check,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sometimes it just pops up and fucks up.</v>

<v Speaker 2>like a golf club.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How about you can can actually kill </v>

<v Speaker 2>I mean it's.</v>

2841
02:00:39.160 --> 02:00:41.680
<v Speaker 2>Think about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to work out.</v>

2842
02:00:41.681 --> 02:00:43.780
<v Speaker 2>Everybody has to work out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're in perfect shape,</v>

2843
02:00:43.781 --> 02:00:47.440
<v Speaker 2>you have to maintain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to keep working on why not work</v>

2844
02:00:47.441 --> 02:00:52.441
<v Speaker 2>out and learn how to take people out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put them to sleep at the same time and </v>

2845
02:00:53.561 --> 02:00:55.510
<v Speaker 2>it's and it's the ultimate video game.</v>

2846
02:00:55.820 --> 02:00:59.080
<v Speaker 2>It's exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You learn some serious self defense.</v>

2847
02:00:59.081 --> 02:01:04.081
<v Speaker 2>It can come up at any time in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's valuable and it gives you so much </v>

2848
02:01:04.081 --> 02:01:06.730
<v Speaker 2>confidence and it's so much fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kills video games.</v>

2849
02:01:07.090 --> 02:01:09.700
<v Speaker 2>It's like there's anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You meet a lot of great people that have</v>

2850
02:01:09.701 --> 02:01:13.480
<v Speaker 2>their ego in check because if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you don't have your ego in check,</v>

2851
02:01:13.810 --> 02:01:18.240
<v Speaker 2>then those people don't survive jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That tapping is that ego?</v>

2852
02:01:18.320 --> 02:01:23.320
<v Speaker 2>A douche bag filter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The tapping because dudes that are just </v>

2853
02:01:23.320 --> 02:01:25.560
<v Speaker 2>just there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's where their eagle rules.</v>

2854
02:01:25.750 --> 02:01:28.150
<v Speaker 2>They can't jump on the mat and get </v>
<v Speaker 2>tapped out.</v>

2855
02:01:28.240 --> 02:01:30.730
<v Speaker 2>They run from it or they get on the edge</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the mats are like,</v>

2856
02:01:30.731 --> 02:01:35.731
<v Speaker 2>no way am I going to let people tap me </v>
<v Speaker 2>out and they don't really don't know </v>

2857
02:01:35.731 --> 02:01:36.010
<v Speaker 2>what's going on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but subconsciously,</v>

2858
02:01:36.160 --> 02:01:39.160
<v Speaker 2>the fear of being dominated and tapping </v>
<v Speaker 2>out by losing,</v>

2859
02:01:39.380 --> 02:01:40.330
<v Speaker 2>looking like a week</v>

2860
02:01:40.330 --> 02:01:45.330
<v Speaker 4>lane that scares people away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You got to look at it like you're just </v>

2861
02:01:45.330 --> 02:01:45.330
<v Speaker 4>learning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You.</v>

2862
02:01:45.330 --> 02:01:48.760
<v Speaker 4>Of course you're going to get tapped out</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the beginning and the more the more </v>

2863
02:01:48.760 --> 02:01:48.760
<v Speaker 4>you come,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the more dedicated you are.</v>

2864
02:01:48.770 --> 02:01:53.770
<v Speaker 4>As time passes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you start tapping dudes out </v>

2865
02:01:53.770 --> 02:01:53.770
<v Speaker 4>occasionally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but still,</v>

2866
02:01:53.770 --> 02:01:55.910
<v Speaker 4>you're usually tapping or beginner,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but ultimately one or two years,</v>

2867
02:01:56.030 --> 02:01:57.000
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

2868
02:01:57.100 --> 02:02:01.250
<v Speaker 4>you can minimize those taps and you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>getting your learning.</v>

2869
02:02:01.430 --> 02:02:03.020
<v Speaker 4>If you did,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you just jitsu for two years,</v>

2870
02:02:03.560 --> 02:02:06.110
<v Speaker 4>the odds are in a street fight one on </v>
<v Speaker 4>one.</v>

2871
02:02:06.230 --> 02:02:10.050
<v Speaker 4>The odds are way on your side way on </v>
<v Speaker 4>your side.</v>

2872
02:02:10.051 --> 02:02:12.920
<v Speaker 4>If you know anybody could,</v>
<v Speaker 4>anything could happen in a street fight,</v>

2873
02:02:12.921 --> 02:02:17.921
<v Speaker 4>but man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a guy that's trained jujitsu two years </v>

2874
02:02:17.921 --> 02:02:17.921
<v Speaker 4>against the guy who has zero training on</v>
<v Speaker 4>the ground.</v>

2875
02:02:18.830 --> 02:02:23.830
<v Speaker 4>Another great aspect of it is it a calms</v>
<v Speaker 4>down your body and it makes you realize </v>

2876
02:02:23.830 --> 02:02:27.431
<v Speaker 4>how much of an influence stress and just</v>
<v Speaker 4>the fact that we have this ancient </v>

2877
02:02:27.431 --> 02:02:31.270
<v Speaker 4>chimpanzee hardware in our system,</v>
<v Speaker 4>our bodies are set up for hunting and </v>

2878
02:02:31.270 --> 02:02:34.871
<v Speaker 4>gathering and carrying things and our </v>
<v Speaker 4>bodies are set up to exert a certain </v>

2879
02:02:34.871 --> 02:02:38.591
<v Speaker 4>amount of energy and if you don't exert </v>
<v Speaker 4>a certain amount of energy with your </v>

2880
02:02:38.591 --> 02:02:41.411
<v Speaker 4>body,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your body starts to betray you and you </v>

2881
02:02:41.411 --> 02:02:43.511
<v Speaker 4>start to get really stressful and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>start to snap at things they wouldn't </v>

2882
02:02:43.511 --> 02:02:43.511
<v Speaker 4>ordinarily snap out.</v>

2883
02:02:43.511 --> 02:02:45.170
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you shouldn't rationally be upset about.</v>

2884
02:02:45.320 --> 02:02:47.030
<v Speaker 4>It allows you to put things into </v>
<v Speaker 4>perspective.</v>

2885
02:02:47.031 --> 02:02:49.790
<v Speaker 4>It calms your body down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was very important,</v>

2886
02:02:49.791 --> 02:02:50.120
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2887
02:02:50.270 --> 02:02:55.270
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are you saying Jujitsu is better than </v>

2888
02:02:55.270 --> 02:02:55.270
<v Speaker 4>quake?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are you going to start that?</v>

2889
02:02:55.550 --> 02:03:00.550
<v Speaker 4>There's a bunch of people put a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 4>videos of cool video games that are out </v>

2890
02:03:00.550 --> 02:03:00.550
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2891

<v Speaker 4>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2892
02:03:00.681 --> 02:03:02.930
<v Speaker 4>lIke to try to tell me that there's all </v>
<v Speaker 4>these different video games.</v>

2893
02:03:03.140 --> 02:03:04.640
<v Speaker 4>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's some insane shit.</v>

2894
02:03:04.760 --> 02:03:06.650
<v Speaker 4>There's this one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know the name of it,</v>

2895
02:03:06.651 --> 02:03:11.651
<v Speaker 4>but they were.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like it looked like they were in </v>

2896
02:03:11.651 --> 02:03:13.691
<v Speaker 4>the jungle and they were like near </v>
<v Speaker 4>something like it looks like some mayan </v>

2897
02:03:13.691 --> 02:03:14.480
<v Speaker 4>temples and shed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The graphics are insane.</v>

2898
02:03:14.481 --> 02:03:16.160
<v Speaker 4>Rushing attack.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what it is,</v>

2899
02:03:16.161 --> 02:03:17.180
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what it is.</v>

2900
02:03:17.181 --> 02:03:22.181
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember what someone put just a</v>
<v Speaker 4>demo up and then someone put crisis out </v>

2901
02:03:22.220 --> 02:03:22.420
<v Speaker 4>of it.</v>

2902
02:03:22.820 --> 02:03:27.820
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but at the demo was insane and then </v>

2903
02:03:27.820 --> 02:03:27.820
<v Speaker 4>crisis was another one that was pretty </v>
<v Speaker 4>interesting.</v>

2904
02:03:27.820 --> 02:03:29.180
<v Speaker 4>A bunch of dudes runnIng around shooting</v>
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>

2905
02:03:29.330 --> 02:03:33.470
<v Speaker 4>but then I put a video of went to watch </v>
<v Speaker 4>a video of quake online and I go back to</v>

2906
02:03:33.471 --> 02:03:38.471
<v Speaker 4>what I said nothing could fuck real </v>
<v Speaker 4>quick because I understand that these </v>

2907
02:03:38.471 --> 02:03:42.250
<v Speaker 4>games are beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I understand these games have all these </v>

2908
02:03:42.250 --> 02:03:44.801
<v Speaker 4>cool things you can do quick for.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All I want to do is fuck people up in </v>

2909
02:03:45.801 --> 02:03:47.990
<v Speaker 4>one-on-one death matches.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what I like to do,</v>

2910
02:03:48.020 --> 02:03:52.010
<v Speaker 4>but yet you're not even talking to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I understand what you're saying,</v>

2911
02:03:52.011 --> 02:03:52.350
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2912
02:03:52.370 --> 02:03:53.930
<v Speaker 4>I'm just saying that if you like death </v>
<v Speaker 4>matches,</v>

2913
02:03:54.020 --> 02:03:57.950
<v Speaker 4>they've taken that the formula of death </v>
<v Speaker 4>match and it just added onto it for like</v>

2914
02:03:57.980 --> 02:04:00.070
<v Speaker 4>the last 15,</v>
<v Speaker 4>20 years or whatever.</v>

2915
02:04:00.110 --> 02:04:00.930
<v Speaker 4>How long?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2916
02:04:00.950 --> 02:04:04.040
<v Speaker 4>quake three was a quick four was 2000 </v>
<v Speaker 4>something.</v>

2917
02:04:04.320 --> 02:04:07.190
<v Speaker 4>It was like 2005 or 2007,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so for the last five,</v>

2918
02:04:07.200 --> 02:04:11.030
<v Speaker 4>six on my number,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they've taken the formula.</v>

2919
02:04:11.031 --> 02:04:16.031
<v Speaker 4>They even use the same engine on call of</v>
<v Speaker 4>duty when it first came out and they've </v>

2920
02:04:16.031 --> 02:04:19.571
<v Speaker 4>just improved it and proved it and </v>
<v Speaker 4>proved it and like a lot of these games </v>

2921
02:04:19.571 --> 02:04:22.511
<v Speaker 4>that like last week I was talking about </v>
<v Speaker 4>like keyboard and mouse necessarily is </v>

2922
02:04:22.511 --> 02:04:25.130
<v Speaker 4>better than controller argument.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My point is is that the games are better</v>

2923
02:04:25.131 --> 02:04:26.610
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The games are better now.</v>

2924
02:04:26.640 --> 02:04:31.640
<v Speaker 4>They're not geared towards the accuracy </v>
<v Speaker 4>of a keyboard and mouse as much as they </v>

2925
02:04:31.640 --> 02:04:32.810
<v Speaker 4>are geared for just having a fun </v>
<v Speaker 4>experience.</v>

2926
02:04:33.740 --> 02:04:35.400
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of auto wave going on.</v>

2927
02:04:37.880 --> 02:04:41.070
<v Speaker 4>It's just easier to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People still do those driving games.</v>

2928
02:04:41.071 --> 02:04:41.640
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2929
02:04:42.240 --> 02:04:43.080
<v Speaker 4>totally.</v>
<v Speaker 4>To me though,</v>

2930
02:04:43.081 --> 02:04:45.570
<v Speaker 4>the what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's fun to me about video games.</v>

2931
02:04:45.690 --> 02:04:47.730
<v Speaker 4>I understand all that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what's fun to me,</v>

2932
02:04:47.731 --> 02:04:52.731
<v Speaker 4>it's just I got addicted straight up to </v>
<v Speaker 4>one on one matches and even like the </v>

2933
02:04:53.220 --> 02:04:54.330
<v Speaker 4>death matches,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2934
02:04:54.360 --> 02:04:59.360
<v Speaker 4>just the fact that you have this </v>
<v Speaker 4>incredibly precise control over the </v>

2935
02:04:59.360 --> 02:05:03.021
<v Speaker 4>eight year,</v>
<v Speaker 4>more like the pool statistic version of </v>

2936
02:05:03.021 --> 02:05:05.390
<v Speaker 4>video games.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's all just a very small </v>

2937
02:05:05.390 --> 02:05:05.390
<v Speaker 4>majority.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2938
02:05:05.390 --> 02:05:07.650
<v Speaker 4>Most people like to play football games </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the control is perfect for that.</v>

2939
02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:11.070
<v Speaker 4>With quick games,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those one-on-one first person shooters.</v>

2940
02:05:11.071 --> 02:05:13.350
<v Speaker 4>It's just so precise.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so addictive.</v>

2941
02:05:13.351 --> 02:05:14.160
<v Speaker 4>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you were talking about,</v>

2942
02:05:14.190 --> 02:05:16.590
<v Speaker 4>was your cousin's addicted to know my </v>
<v Speaker 4>nephew,</v>

2943
02:05:16.591 --> 02:05:17.520
<v Speaker 4>nephew,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2944
02:05:17.521 --> 02:05:19.720
<v Speaker 4>When I was a little kid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if he hit me with some quake,</v>

2945
02:05:19.721 --> 02:05:20.630
<v Speaker 4>I would have lost my life.</v>

2946
02:05:20.640 --> 02:05:22.080
<v Speaker 4>I would have never got into martial </v>
<v Speaker 4>arts.</v>

2947
02:05:22.081 --> 02:05:24.420
<v Speaker 4>I would have never got productive with </v>
<v Speaker 4>my life.</v>

2948
02:05:24.450 --> 02:05:25.890
<v Speaker 4>I would have never paid attention in </v>
<v Speaker 4>school.</v>

2949
02:05:25.940 --> 02:05:30.940
<v Speaker 4>Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a game on steam that you can </v>

2950
02:05:30.940 --> 02:05:30.940
<v Speaker 4>play on your mac that has nothing to do </v>
<v Speaker 4>with it,</v>

2951
02:05:30.940 --> 02:05:32.850
<v Speaker 4>but I want you to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Next time you're bored and you just want</v>

2952
02:05:32.851 --> 02:05:35.550
<v Speaker 4>to spend it because it's a really short </v>
<v Speaker 4>game so you can't get addicted to it.</v>

2953
02:05:35.870 --> 02:05:38.880
<v Speaker 4>Like it's like literally you could beat </v>
<v Speaker 4>it in like six hours really,</v>

2954
02:05:38.940 --> 02:05:41.610
<v Speaker 4>but it's called portal and I think ours,</v>
<v Speaker 4>jesus,</v>

2955
02:05:41.611 --> 02:05:43.100
<v Speaker 4>I ain't got six hours like our kids.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2956
02:05:43.160 --> 02:05:48.160
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but six hours spread up for like a </v>

2957
02:05:48.160 --> 02:05:48.160
<v Speaker 4>month.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that's a,</v>

2958
02:05:48.160 --> 02:05:48.160
<v Speaker 4>that's an addiction.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You will that.</v>

2959
02:05:48.160 --> 02:05:50.660
<v Speaker 4>That game alone will set your mind </v>
<v Speaker 4>racing to wildland.</v>

2960
02:05:50.670 --> 02:05:54.960
<v Speaker 4>How crazy video games are nowadays.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what is the best one right now?</v>

2961
02:05:55.020 --> 02:06:00.020
<v Speaker 4>If I wanted to get something for xbox </v>
<v Speaker 4>and something that just got blow my </v>

2962
02:06:00.020 --> 02:06:00.020
<v Speaker 4>fucking mind.</v>

2963
02:06:00.020 --> 02:06:04.580
<v Speaker 4>Here's a war for you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would probably go with more of like a </v>

2964
02:06:04.580 --> 02:06:08.430
<v Speaker 4>borderlands or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I would actually find a game that </v>

2965
02:06:08.430 --> 02:06:08.880
<v Speaker 4>you could play on your mac.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2966
02:06:09.180 --> 02:06:11.580
<v Speaker 4>like a game,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like call of duty that you can play.</v>

2967
02:06:11.581 --> 02:06:15.870
<v Speaker 4>I think he called dd four is on there </v>
<v Speaker 4>and there's a couple scenes from call of</v>

2968
02:06:15.871 --> 02:06:17.640
<v Speaker 4>duty for that will blow your fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>mind.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Don't get that shit.</v>

2971
02:06:23.340 --> 02:06:25.890
<v Speaker 4>That's just grand theft auto,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but using a horse and cowboy.</v>

2972
02:06:25.920 --> 02:06:30.920
<v Speaker 4>What's it called?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's called red dead dawn or something </v>

2973
02:06:30.920 --> 02:06:30.920
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I gave it a chance,</v>

2974
02:06:30.920 --> 02:06:30.920
<v Speaker 4>but I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I don't wanna play anymore.</v>

2976
02:06:31.620 --> 02:06:33.480
<v Speaker 4>That was a hugely successful game </v>
<v Speaker 4>though.</v>

2977
02:06:33.600 --> 02:06:34.540
<v Speaker 4>Super.</v>

02:09:07.111 --> 02:09:09.061
<v Speaker 4>up from the first set you did on </v>
<v Speaker 4>thursday night to the last set you did </v>

3042
02:09:09.061 --> 02:09:09.061
<v Speaker 4>on saturday night,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which was your best one,</v>

3044
02:09:11.011 --> 02:09:13.960
<v Speaker 4>That second set.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Saturday I acted like I smoked marijuana</v>

3045
02:09:13.961 --> 02:09:16.240
<v Speaker 4>before I went onstage before I went on </v>
<v Speaker 4>stage,</v>

3046
02:09:16.930 --> 02:09:18.900
<v Speaker 4>the second chat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Remember before we all,</v>

3047
02:09:18.901 --> 02:09:20.890
<v Speaker 4>we all didn't really smoke out because I</v>
<v Speaker 4>was like,</v>

3048
02:09:20.900 --> 02:09:22.180
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do it,</v>

3049
02:09:22.181 --> 02:09:22.480
<v Speaker 4>do it.</v>

3050
02:09:22.480 --> 02:09:22.990
<v Speaker 4>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

3051
02:09:22.991 --> 02:09:24.880
<v Speaker 4>I don't want.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the data show that you had,</v>

3052
02:09:24.881 --> 02:09:27.490
<v Speaker 4>was the one where you weren't high,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you went high at all?</v>

3053
02:09:27.520 --> 02:09:32.520
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it must've been a little high from the </v>

3054
02:09:32.520 --> 02:09:32.520
<v Speaker 4>first time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that was like,</v>

3055
02:09:32.520 --> 02:09:33.100
<v Speaker 4>it had leveled off because you were </v>
<v Speaker 4>nervous.</v>

3056
02:09:33.410 --> 02:09:35.350
<v Speaker 4>Weed isn't that great when You're </v>
<v Speaker 4>nervous man.</v>

3057
02:09:35.351 --> 02:09:37.150
<v Speaker 4>And he realized that that you were </v>
<v Speaker 4>probably,</v>

3058
02:09:37.151 --> 02:09:42.151
<v Speaker 4>you hide got paranoid and I was getting </v>
<v Speaker 4>high like and then going on stage like </v>

3059
02:09:42.151 --> 02:09:43.520
<v Speaker 4>five minutes later.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not a good mix for me,</v>

3060
02:09:43.530 --> 02:09:48.530
<v Speaker 4>adam.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not good mixture of the podcast </v>

3061
02:09:48.530 --> 02:09:50.131
<v Speaker 4>either before we've done that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Many times we get high right before we </v>

3062
02:09:50.131 --> 02:09:50.131
<v Speaker 4>do the podcasts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like today,</v>

3063
02:09:50.131 --> 02:09:55.080
<v Speaker 4>first words out of my mouth while I </v>
<v Speaker 4>crawls and they don't come out that </v>

3064
02:09:55.080 --> 02:09:55.080
<v Speaker 4>good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3065
02:09:55.080 --> 02:09:59.400
<v Speaker 4>But like right now or two hours in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's all smooth and once you're killing </v>

3066
02:09:59.400 --> 02:10:01.030
<v Speaker 4>and you're really confident you can't </v>
<v Speaker 4>wait to go on state.</v>

3067
02:10:01.180 --> 02:10:02.890
<v Speaker 4>Then the weed will take it through the </v>
<v Speaker 4>roof.</v>

3068
02:10:02.950 --> 02:10:07.950
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But even then you gotta make sure you </v>

3069
02:10:07.950 --> 02:10:07.950
<v Speaker 4>don't get too hard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think red bull and vodka,</v>

3070
02:10:07.950 --> 02:10:11.371
<v Speaker 4>what are one or two of them before on </v>
<v Speaker 4>stage is the key ingredient for standup </v>

3071
02:10:11.371 --> 02:10:11.740
<v Speaker 4>comedy?</v>
<v Speaker 4>One or two red bull's and vodka.</v>

3072
02:10:12.010 --> 02:10:15.010
<v Speaker 4>Red bull vodka.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like a little bit of weed.</v>

3073
02:10:15.250 --> 02:10:20.250
<v Speaker 4>Some calisthenics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My best teaching always comes from me </v>

3074
02:10:20.250 --> 02:10:23.590
<v Speaker 4>being high when I teach because I'm so </v>
<v Speaker 4>confident with it that it adds to it.</v>

3075
02:10:23.740 --> 02:10:25.440
<v Speaker 4>Like I'll be pissed off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if I forget,</v>

3076
02:10:25.690 --> 02:10:26.900
<v Speaker 4>if I forget,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I forgot.</v>

3077
02:10:27.070 --> 02:10:32.070
<v Speaker 4>I don't have lead right now and I didn't</v>
<v Speaker 4>teach class today stoned this morning.</v>

3078
02:10:32.650 --> 02:10:34.580
<v Speaker 4>I didn't teach guide.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I felt pretty good.</v>

3079
02:10:34.640 --> 02:10:39.640
<v Speaker 4>I mean if it was a good class,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I always feel like when I'm high </v>

3080
02:10:39.640 --> 02:10:40.790
<v Speaker 4>it's just like I don't want a class to </v>
<v Speaker 4>end.</v>

3081
02:10:40.820 --> 02:10:42.680
<v Speaker 4>I want her to keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want more time.</v>

3082
02:10:42.681 --> 02:10:44.420
<v Speaker 4>When I'm in that space,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in that zone,</v>

3083
02:10:44.421 --> 02:10:45.350
<v Speaker 4>like shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm running out of time.</v>

3084
02:10:45.351 --> 02:10:48.830
<v Speaker 4>There's so much I've got to say and show</v>
<v Speaker 4>when we don't show.</v>

3085
02:10:49.130 --> 02:10:51.330
<v Speaker 4>We got high in the car right before we </v>
<v Speaker 4>went in there.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3088
02:10:56.760 --> 02:10:59.390
<v Speaker 4>it's bewildering though because when we </v>
<v Speaker 4>walked in,</v>

<v Speaker 4>and is a crazy fucking real thing </v>

02:11:44.801 --> 02:11:49.801
<v Speaker 4>they're doing where they're driving </v>
<v Speaker 4>through neighborhoods and they're </v>

3104
02:11:49.801 --> 02:11:52.741
<v Speaker 4>blasting these cars with these super </v>
<v Speaker 4>powerful x rays from these vans and </v>

3105
02:11:53.231 --> 02:11:58.231
<v Speaker 4>they're looking inside of vehicles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have photos of the show was in </v>

3106

3107
02:11:58.871 --> 02:12:03.871
<v Speaker 4>and they're doing it to houses too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They Just drive by and point this </v>

3108
02:12:03.871 --> 02:12:07.531
<v Speaker 4>fucking crazy x ray gun at cars and see </v>
<v Speaker 4>right through and they show all these </v>

3109
02:12:07.531 --> 02:12:09.610
<v Speaker 4>photos of people looking at like bricks </v>
<v Speaker 4>of cocaine.</v>

3110
02:12:09.611 --> 02:12:12.340
<v Speaker 4>The back of a van like this is nuts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

3111
02:12:12.550 --> 02:12:13.330
<v Speaker 4>Like they,</v>

3112
02:12:13.360 --> 02:12:15.670
<v Speaker 4>they can shoot x-rays.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It just makes me,</v>

3113
02:12:15.700 --> 02:12:19.630
<v Speaker 4>it just makes me really wonder though </v>
<v Speaker 4>how like people go on and the radiation,</v>

3114
02:12:19.631 --> 02:12:24.631
<v Speaker 4>like what exactly how strong it is </v>
<v Speaker 4>because the other day I was talking to </v>

3115
02:12:24.631 --> 02:12:25.360
<v Speaker 4>my dentist and he said like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3116
02:12:25.490 --> 02:12:30.490
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this radiation is about equal to </v>

3117
02:12:30.490 --> 02:12:30.490
<v Speaker 4>standing next to a microwave.</v>

3118
02:12:30.490 --> 02:12:30.490
<v Speaker 4>That's what he said.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3119
02:12:30.490 --> 02:12:31.010
<v Speaker 4>Something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I forgot.</v>

3120
02:12:31.040 --> 02:12:33.730
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what to where a lead vest </v>
<v Speaker 4>when you microwaves or popcorn.</v>

3121
02:12:33.760 --> 02:12:35.800
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what that's for,</v>

3122
02:12:35.801 --> 02:12:37.360
<v Speaker 4>but that he said it's not that big a </v>
<v Speaker 4>deal.</v>

3123
02:12:37.361 --> 02:12:38.770
<v Speaker 4>that's why he's not wearing the lead </v>
<v Speaker 4>vest,</v>

3124
02:12:38.771 --> 02:12:41.160
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And well the crazy thing is that there's</v>

3125
02:12:41.170 --> 02:12:46.170
<v Speaker 4>radiation around us all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Make yourself space microWaving your </v>

3126
02:12:46.170 --> 02:12:50.791
<v Speaker 4>brain every time you put up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No one knows what's happening with </v>

3127
02:12:50.791 --> 02:12:50.791
<v Speaker 4>those.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3129
02:12:53.670 --> 02:12:53.670
<v Speaker 4>your car though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you got a hands free,</v>

3130
02:12:53.670 --> 02:12:53.670
<v Speaker 4>is that okay?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3131
02:12:53.670 --> 02:12:55.340
<v Speaker 4>not when you have your phone between </v>
<v Speaker 4>your crotch when you're tryIng to cook.</v>

3132
02:12:55.380 --> 02:12:58.120
<v Speaker 4>And it was a study released recently </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

3133
02:12:58.121 --> 02:13:00.100
<v Speaker 4>So that laptops cook your balls.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Cook your sperm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

3135
02:13:00.930 --> 02:13:03.640
<v Speaker 4>that's totally makes sperm and </v>
<v Speaker 4>effective.</v>

3136
02:13:03.940 --> 02:13:05.770
<v Speaker 4>If you have your laptop on your lap.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3137
02:13:05.771 --> 02:13:08.330
<v Speaker 4>You cook in your balls but not up there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3142
02:13:16.561 --> 02:13:19.310
<v Speaker 4>So I got this little pad that sits on </v>
<v Speaker 4>the laptop.</v>

3143
02:13:19.311 --> 02:13:22.030
<v Speaker 4>It makes them more comfortable anyway </v>
<v Speaker 4>because the bottom is soft,</v>

3144
02:13:22.031 --> 02:13:27.031
<v Speaker 4>so it sort of molds to your legs and </v>
