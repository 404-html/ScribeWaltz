1
00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:12.860
<v Speaker 1>Experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm always trying to type faster than</v>

2
00:00:15.991 --> 00:00:20.490
<v Speaker 1>that commercial and I always fail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm trying to tweet this live in the</v>

3
00:00:20.491 --> 00:00:22.380
<v Speaker 1>moment and then stare at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My,</v>

4
00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.560
<v Speaker 1>with my ever shittier eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

5
00:00:25.561 --> 00:00:27.600
<v Speaker 1>Tell me what am I supposed to tweet it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing this right now.</v>

6
00:00:27.601 --> 00:00:30.740
<v Speaker 1>I just tweeted it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could retweet it and that way it'll</v>

7
00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.370
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've tweeted,</v>

8
00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:36.870
<v Speaker 1>my eyes are fine until I w I stare at my</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking computer too much.</v>

9
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:37.301
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

10
00:00:37.301 --> 00:00:39.930
<v Speaker 1>they get screwed up and then you try to</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at the TV and you can't see what's</v>

11
00:00:39.931 --> 00:00:42.180
<v Speaker 1>going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's guaranteed it's age,</v>

12
00:00:42.181 --> 00:00:45.420
<v Speaker 1>but it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think screens are good for you.</v>

13
00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.410
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever like taken a picture with</v>
<v Speaker 1>your cell phone of a screen and then you</v>

14
00:00:49.411 --> 00:00:52.200
<v Speaker 1>see those lines that you can't say like</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever the fuck those are.</v>

15
00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.480
<v Speaker 1>Well let's actually just your phones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the aperture on the camera's not able to</v>

16
00:00:57.481 --> 00:01:01.090
<v Speaker 1>catch up with the flickering images</v>
<v Speaker 1>arise.</v>

17
00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.000
<v Speaker 1>So then if I'm looking through this</v>
<v Speaker 1>screen at that,</v>

18
00:01:03.001 --> 00:01:06.330
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't fuck with my eyes and think</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the actual strain of staring at</v>

19
00:01:06.331 --> 00:01:10.050
<v Speaker 1>something that's lit up so close to your</v>
<v Speaker 1>face that's really fucking with you more</v>

20
00:01:10.051 --> 00:01:11.430
<v Speaker 1>than anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that correct?</v>

21
00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.280
<v Speaker 1>Is that the correct aperture?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that the correct terminology?</v>

22
00:01:14.281 --> 00:01:16.190
<v Speaker 1>And you're squinting or you're reading,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

23
00:01:16.191 --> 00:01:17.970
<v Speaker 1>you're squinting your eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't even realize it,</v>

24
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.460
<v Speaker 1>but that's not what we're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about the flashing thing.</v>

25
00:01:20.461 --> 00:01:24.150
<v Speaker 1>The flashing thing like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just your camera can't catch shutter</v>

26
00:01:24.151 --> 00:01:26.370
<v Speaker 1>speeds that what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

27
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.840
<v Speaker 1>like if you watch a cars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you see videos of cars that have LCD</v>

28
00:01:30.841 --> 00:01:33.150
<v Speaker 1>lenses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something happens when you film</v>

29
00:01:33.151 --> 00:01:34.740
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looks like they're flashing.</v>

30
00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.380
<v Speaker 1>It's a different refresh rate usually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

31
00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.750
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like any of that shit,</v>

32
00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.170
<v Speaker 1>which is why my new special,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually did it in black and white</v>

33
00:01:43.171 --> 00:01:45.120
<v Speaker 1>because I don't like HD TV.</v>

34
00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.180
<v Speaker 1>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like seeing somebody pours is</v>

35
00:01:48.181 --> 00:01:50.040
<v Speaker 1>they're talking to me like HD at this</v>
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>

36
00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:53.250
<v Speaker 1>It was great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it got to a point where it was</v>

37
00:01:53.251 --> 00:01:54.480
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was too real.</v>

38
00:01:54.481 --> 00:01:57.300
<v Speaker 1>It's clearer than real life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I went to a game at a Dallas</v>

39
00:01:57.301 --> 00:02:01.950
<v Speaker 1>Cowboys Football Stadium and they've got</v>
<v Speaker 1>this giant fucking TV classic Texas,</v>

40
00:02:01.951 --> 00:02:03.960
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've got the biggest fucking TV,</v>

41
00:02:03.961 --> 00:02:07.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that means we're the best and it was so</v>

42
00:02:07.561 --> 00:02:10.320
<v Speaker 1>clear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks realer than what was going on</v>

43
00:02:10.321 --> 00:02:11.640
<v Speaker 1>in the field.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you,</v>

44
00:02:11.641 --> 00:02:13.530
<v Speaker 1>I had to like pull my at the visor down</v>
<v Speaker 1>on my,</v>

45
00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.410
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my head cause I kept wanting to look at</v>

46
00:02:16.411 --> 00:02:17.660
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tony,</v>

47
00:02:17.661 --> 00:02:20.250
<v Speaker 1>we're almost like right in front of me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The promoter hook me up with these great</v>

48
00:02:20.251 --> 00:02:22.690
<v Speaker 1>seats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's fucking right there and I'm looking</v>

49
00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.970
<v Speaker 1>up further away than he is for me</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking up at this giant fucking TV.</v>

50
00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.160
<v Speaker 1>It's also an instinct to look at</v>
<v Speaker 1>screens.</v>

51
00:02:29.161 --> 00:02:32.100
<v Speaker 1>I see that a lot of the UFC people are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their babies do it.</v>

52
00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.920
<v Speaker 1>Everybody does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an instinct to stare because it's</v>

53
00:02:34.921 --> 00:02:38.520
<v Speaker 1>so captivating and we're used to staring</v>
<v Speaker 1>at screens.</v>

54
00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.760
<v Speaker 1>So like if you're at a sporting event</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's a screen there,</v>

55
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.130
<v Speaker 1>you just autumn automatically start</v>
<v Speaker 1>gravitating towards that screen for</v>

56
00:02:45.131 --> 00:02:46.650
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I look at the screens here,</v>

57
00:02:46.651 --> 00:02:49.620
<v Speaker 1>I usually always just look right here</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of looking right there.</v>

58
00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.260
<v Speaker 1>Well you should,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're actually running shit as supposed</v>

59
00:02:52.261 --> 00:02:54.860
<v Speaker 1>to do that and make sure that nothing's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

60
00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.640
<v Speaker 1>demons behind us and we don't know</v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

61
00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.890
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a fan of a technology</v>

62
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:01.470
<v Speaker 2>electronics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I liked some of it.</v>

63
00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.510
<v Speaker 2>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like all the benefits of it are</v>

64
00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.140
<v Speaker 2>taken away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then some with the crashing,</v>

65
00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.480
<v Speaker 2>with the refreshing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the,</v>

66
00:03:10.481 --> 00:03:12.460
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck just happened with the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

67
00:03:12.461 --> 00:03:15.880
<v Speaker 2>now this is outdated and I have to buy a</v>
<v Speaker 2>new one and then I throw this one into</v>

68
00:03:15.881 --> 00:03:18.070
<v Speaker 2>the fucking ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go back and forth.</v>

69
00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:20.740
<v Speaker 2>I love it in a lot of ways because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

70
00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.940
<v Speaker 2>I'm just fascinated by innovation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm fascinated by these new things that</v>

71
00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:28.270
<v Speaker 2>these new people keep inventing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's also part of me that</v>

72
00:03:28.271 --> 00:03:31.210
<v Speaker 2>realizes that a certain point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tom's not benefiting us anymore.</v>

73
00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:36.370
<v Speaker 2>It's not like making our lives easier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just making things more connected</v>

74
00:03:36.371 --> 00:03:40.270
<v Speaker 2>to electronics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's making you more into like whatever</v>

75
00:03:40.271 --> 00:03:42.450
<v Speaker 2>world to the electronics create.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

76
00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:46.630
<v Speaker 2>Somewhere in the 90s we pretty much</v>
<v Speaker 2>could have slat towed here we will fine</v>

77
00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:49.240
<v Speaker 2>and even people say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well what about medical stuff and like</v>

78
00:03:49.241 --> 00:03:51.730
<v Speaker 2>helping people out and everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>helping them live long and cure disease</v>

79
00:03:51.731 --> 00:03:52.120
<v Speaker 2>and everything.</v>

80
00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.080
<v Speaker 2>That basically kills the rest of us to</v>
<v Speaker 2>keep that other person alive and then</v>

81
00:03:56.081 --> 00:03:58.750
<v Speaker 2>they're still alive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>taken a shit that ends up in a river and</v>

82
00:03:58.751 --> 00:04:00.700
<v Speaker 2>it just keeps polluting more and more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're just,</v>

83
00:04:00.701 --> 00:04:02.500
<v Speaker 2>we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've just for all over the fucking</v>

84
00:04:02.501 --> 00:04:05.050
<v Speaker 2>place and it really needs to shrink</v>
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>

85
00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.870
<v Speaker 2>Like the technology I don't think would</v>
<v Speaker 2>be a problem if they weren't.</v>

86
00:04:07.871 --> 00:04:12.430
<v Speaker 2>So everybody has a fucking lapped are so</v>
<v Speaker 2>many people have laptops and shirts and</v>

87
00:04:12.431 --> 00:04:15.340
<v Speaker 2>all this shit that we just keep buying</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then throw it out.</v>

88
00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:17.380
<v Speaker 2>Like you know that Paul put litter in</v>
<v Speaker 2>its place.</v>

89
00:04:17.381 --> 00:04:18.970
<v Speaker 2>You ever think about that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like when they pick it up,</v>

90
00:04:18.971 --> 00:04:21.040
<v Speaker 2>where do you think it goes?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think it leaves earth?</v>

91
00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:23.770
<v Speaker 2>It just goes somewhere else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't have to look at it and it's</v>

92
00:04:23.771 --> 00:04:26.420
<v Speaker 2>just fucking sitting there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's going to happen is they're going</v>

93
00:04:26.421 --> 00:04:31.330
<v Speaker 2>to figure out a way to take everything</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we make and turn it into either a</v>

94
00:04:31.331 --> 00:04:34.300
<v Speaker 2>product or turn it into fuel.</v>

95
00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:36.820
<v Speaker 2>Like whenever we make something and we</v>
<v Speaker 2>have to throw it out,</v>

96
00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:39.070
<v Speaker 2>it'll just become fuel for something</v>
<v Speaker 2>else.</v>

97
00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:43.240
<v Speaker 2>Do you know how many people would have</v>
<v Speaker 2>to agree just to even get that ball even</v>

98
00:04:43.241 --> 00:04:44.650
<v Speaker 2>slightly moving?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They will just,</v>

99
00:04:44.651 --> 00:04:47.260
<v Speaker 2>somehow Jesus would be brought up and</v>
<v Speaker 2>somehow,</v>

100
00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:50.350
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just something them versus us,</v>

101
00:04:50.351 --> 00:04:51.550
<v Speaker 2>Republican,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Democrat,</v>

102
00:04:51.551 --> 00:04:53.620
<v Speaker 2>liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>conservative and nothing would get done</v>

103
00:04:53.621 --> 00:04:56.410
<v Speaker 2>and they would just sit there screaming</v>
<v Speaker 2>at each other maybe.</v>

104
00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:01.330
<v Speaker 2>Or maybe they could figure out a way to</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually use whatever the fuck pollution</v>

105
00:05:01.331 --> 00:05:03.400
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like whatever the carbon goes into the</v>

106
00:05:03.401 --> 00:05:06.790
<v Speaker 2>atmosphere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pull that out and convert that into</v>

107
00:05:06.791 --> 00:05:09.580
<v Speaker 2>energy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems like there's probably some</v>

108
00:05:09.581 --> 00:05:12.910
<v Speaker 2>fucking nerds that already know how to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do something along those lines.</v>

109
00:05:12.911 --> 00:05:15.340
<v Speaker 2>Maybe not to that level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at least take the shit from down the</v>

110
00:05:15.341 --> 00:05:16.091
<v Speaker 2>dump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

111
00:05:16.091 --> 00:05:19.990
<v Speaker 2>they know how to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's just no money in it and it's</v>

112
00:05:19.991 --> 00:05:23.150
<v Speaker 2>just like they probably get checks to</v>
<v Speaker 2>not get things done.</v>

113
00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:27.040
<v Speaker 2>Please show up with hookers and fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>just a fucking big freight train full of</v>

114
00:05:27.041 --> 00:05:28.390
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kalon boys.</v>

115
00:05:28.391 --> 00:05:32.560
<v Speaker 2>It's a party so that then we got to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>all new machines that's going to cost us</v>

116
00:05:32.561 --> 00:05:36.370
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just do it the way we do it until we die</v>

117
00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:38.590
<v Speaker 2>and then you guys can do it how you want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do it.</v>

118
00:05:38.591 --> 00:05:40.150
<v Speaker 2>By then someone else has bought into the</v>
<v Speaker 2>deal.</v>

119
00:05:40.151 --> 00:05:42.370
<v Speaker 2>So I am completely pessimistic when it</v>
<v Speaker 2>comes to that shit.</v>

120
00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.880
<v Speaker 2>People think that that's all bullshit</v>
<v Speaker 2>that like those kinds of conspiracies</v>

121
00:05:45.881 --> 00:05:47.320
<v Speaker 2>don't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come on,</v>

122
00:05:47.321 --> 00:05:49.320
<v Speaker 2>you guys are just nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is stupid.</v>

123
00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:51.190
<v Speaker 2>Nobody would do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they get rid of pollution,</v>

124
00:05:51.191 --> 00:05:53.920
<v Speaker 2>they would.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if getting rid of the pollution</v>

125
00:05:53.921 --> 00:05:57.590
<v Speaker 2>costs somebody money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guarantee you there'd be somebody that</v>

126
00:05:57.591 --> 00:05:58.130
<v Speaker 2>tried to cock</v>

127
00:05:58.130 --> 00:05:59.030
<v Speaker 3>pocket.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

128
00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:01.380
<v Speaker 3>there would be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If there was a guy like the,</v>

129
00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:03.590
<v Speaker 3>the classic William Randolph Hearst</v>
<v Speaker 3>story,</v>

130
00:06:03.591 --> 00:06:05.960
<v Speaker 3>I don't know this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the reason why marijuana became</v>

131
00:06:05.961 --> 00:06:08.780
<v Speaker 3>illegal wasn't because there was a</v>
<v Speaker 3>problem with people smoking marijuana.</v>

132
00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:13.950
<v Speaker 3>It was because William Randolph Hearst</v>
<v Speaker 3>owned paper mills and he also own</v>

133
00:06:13.951 --> 00:06:18.560
<v Speaker 3>newspapers and so he was going to have</v>
<v Speaker 3>to convert his paper mills over the hemp</v>

134
00:06:18.561 --> 00:06:23.561
<v Speaker 3>paper because it's way easier to grow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You refill an entire forest in like a</v>

135
00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:25.060
<v Speaker 3>year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you chop them down.</v>

136
00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:26.240
<v Speaker 3>They brought her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah.</v>

137
00:06:26.241 --> 00:06:30.560
<v Speaker 3>I mean he owned a lot of newspapers and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was the reason why Rosebud was,</v>

138
00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:31.340
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that whole,</v>

139
00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:33.890
<v Speaker 3>that whole citizen Kane movie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the coast,</v>

140
00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:35.690
<v Speaker 3>he's fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was fucking crazy.</v>

141
00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:39.860
<v Speaker 3>But he had so much money and so much</v>
<v Speaker 3>power that he could just print fake</v>

142
00:06:39.861 --> 00:06:43.340
<v Speaker 3>stories.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he wrote these stories about blacks</v>

143
00:06:43.341 --> 00:06:45.470
<v Speaker 3>and Mexicans and I'm sure he didn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>write them,</v>

144
00:06:45.471 --> 00:06:49.010
<v Speaker 3>but he commissioned them blacks and</v>
<v Speaker 3>Michigan smoking this new drug called</v>

145
00:06:49.011 --> 00:06:51.020
<v Speaker 3>marijuana and having sex with all these</v>
<v Speaker 3>white women.</v>

146
00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.960
<v Speaker 3>Like that wasn't even what they called</v>
<v Speaker 3>marijuana.</v>

147
00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:56.900
<v Speaker 3>If he actually did that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to have people died because of</v>

148
00:06:56.901 --> 00:06:58.220
<v Speaker 3>that story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh God.</v>

149
00:06:58.221 --> 00:07:01.490
<v Speaker 3>A lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure a lot people in jail.</v>

150
00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:02.630
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just think about that.</v>

151
00:07:02.631 --> 00:07:05.330
<v Speaker 3>That was in the 1930s and it's still</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuck.</v>

152
00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:08.300
<v Speaker 3>It was all about hemp.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't even about marijuana.</v>

153
00:07:08.301 --> 00:07:09.860
<v Speaker 3>They weren't even worried about the</v>
<v Speaker 3>drug.</v>

154
00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:13.700
<v Speaker 3>The drug was commonly used amongst jazz</v>
<v Speaker 3>singers and all these other people.</v>

155
00:07:13.701 --> 00:07:15.830
<v Speaker 3>It's smoked pot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a normal thing.</v>

156
00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:18.530
<v Speaker 3>The real issue was the hemp,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the commodity,</v>

157
00:07:18.531 --> 00:07:22.370
<v Speaker 3>the non psychoactive hemp.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were worried about it taking over</v>

158
00:07:22.371 --> 00:07:26.570
<v Speaker 3>and having to spend millions of dollars</v>
<v Speaker 3>to convert all his paper plants to hemp</v>

159
00:07:26.571 --> 00:07:27.310
<v Speaker 3>paper.</v>

160
00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:28.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just want to smoke weed</v>

161
00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:36.120
<v Speaker 2>against the good spirits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People who don't believe in conspiracy</v>

162
00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:38.170
<v Speaker 2>is fighting to be.</v>

<v Speaker 2>president in the middle of it doesn't</v>

179
00:08:13.031 --> 00:08:14.620
<v Speaker 2>mean it's not a conspiracy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 2>the shed like the end</v>

181
00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:18.870
<v Speaker 3>Ron's disaster that went down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was a conspiracy.</v>

182
00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:22.290
<v Speaker 3>There's a bunch of conspiracies that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>could see in clear form</v>

183
00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:23.540
<v Speaker 2>that actually did happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

184
00:08:23.541 --> 00:08:27.640
<v Speaker 2>the best thing they did is they make</v>
<v Speaker 2>conspiracy synonymous with more ronic</v>

185
00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:28.610
<v Speaker 2>thought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And everybody says,</v>

00:08:28.611 --> 00:08:29.720
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you putting your 10 ad on.</v>

187
00:08:29.721 --> 00:08:31.970
<v Speaker 2>It's like this whole country came about</v>
<v Speaker 2>through a conspiracy.</v>

188
00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:34.820
<v Speaker 2>The Revolution was not a spontaneous</v>
<v Speaker 2>act.</v>

189
00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:36.590
<v Speaker 2>People sat there and was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

190
00:08:36.591 --> 00:08:37.880
<v Speaker 2>we're going to rebel against these</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuckers.</v>

191
00:08:37.881 --> 00:08:40.640
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're gonna hang us as traders if we</v>

192
00:08:40.641 --> 00:08:42.980
<v Speaker 2>don't pull this off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They came up with a game plan,</v>

193
00:08:42.981 --> 00:08:44.900
<v Speaker 2>if you want to call it that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if,</v>

194
00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:46.910
<v Speaker 2>if they lost,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would,</v>

195
00:08:46.911 --> 00:08:50.990
<v Speaker 2>they would have been talking about this</v>
<v Speaker 2>treasonous conspiracy by all these guys</v>

196
00:08:50.991 --> 00:08:55.190
<v Speaker 2>that are now on our money site.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right up.</v>

197
00:08:55.191 --> 00:08:57.150
<v Speaker 2>So true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's so true.</v>

198
00:08:57.180 --> 00:08:57.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But now,</v>

199
00:08:57.870 --> 00:09:00.270
<v Speaker 2>but then if you say you're into any sort</v>
<v Speaker 2>of conspiracy,</v>

200
00:09:00.271 --> 00:09:04.410
<v Speaker 2>that automatically means you think nine</v>
<v Speaker 2>11 was an inside job and that the moon</v>

201
00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:05.243
<v Speaker 2>was made out of cheese.</v>

202
00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:08.520
<v Speaker 2>Well nine 11 is the best one because</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the one that I was using.</v>

203
00:09:08.521 --> 00:09:10.110
<v Speaker 2>My favorite one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When people don't believe in</v>

204
00:09:10.111 --> 00:09:11.100
<v Speaker 2>conspiracies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just say,</v>

205
00:09:11.101 --> 00:09:14.760
<v Speaker 2>do you believe that nine 11 happened?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they say yes.</v>

206
00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:19.470
<v Speaker 2>Well then you believe in conspiracies</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause people conspired to fucking hijack</v>

<v Speaker 2>involved.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I didn't realize that until a few years</v>
<v Speaker 2>ago.</v>

231
00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:29.850
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even know that math was like an</v>
<v Speaker 2>important part of their diet back then.</v>

232
00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:31.980
<v Speaker 2>I never saw that in the Ken Burns</v>
<v Speaker 2>documentary.</v>

233
00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:35.970
<v Speaker 2>It's apparently of just a historical</v>
<v Speaker 2>fact.</v>

234
00:10:35.971 --> 00:10:38.310
<v Speaker 2>And even there was a recent report on</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hitler.</v>

235
00:10:38.311 --> 00:10:39.480
<v Speaker 2>Hitler himself was on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

236
00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:42.240
<v Speaker 2>a litany of medication and one of them</v>
<v Speaker 2>was meth.</v>

237
00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:44.940
<v Speaker 2>They were giving a meth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would give meth to people,</v>

238
00:10:44.941 --> 00:10:47.940
<v Speaker 2>but I can't fault him for that dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The amount of energy that that guy put</v>

239
00:10:47.941 --> 00:10:51.030
<v Speaker 2>out during his speeches,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he needed something to level off.</v>

240
00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:56.670
<v Speaker 2>Forget about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>forget about the screaming and yelling.</v>

241
00:10:56.700 --> 00:11:01.230
<v Speaker 2>Just sitting that still</v>
<v Speaker 2>waiting for the right moment.</v>

242
00:11:01.231 --> 00:11:03.110
<v Speaker 2>Building them into that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That frenzy.</v>

243
00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:05.580
<v Speaker 2>Do you ever watch that Michael Jackson</v>
<v Speaker 2>documentary right before he died,</v>

244
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.760
<v Speaker 2>when he drove,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just freeze after he did a dance move.</v>

245
00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:10.620
<v Speaker 2>Let it simmer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let it simmer.</v>

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:53.793
<v Speaker 2>it's nothing.</v>

263
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:55.720
<v Speaker 1>You know the thing about a guy like</v>
<v Speaker 1>Michael Jackson,</v>

264
00:11:55.721 --> 00:11:58.000
<v Speaker 1>he's up there doing some shit you can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>

00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:02.140
<v Speaker 1>he spinning and moon walking and it's an</v>
<v Speaker 1>acrobatic event.</v>

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:06.510
<v Speaker 1>But you see a guy like you are a guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>like me on stage talking and you're</v>

267
00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:07.720
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

268
00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:09.970
<v Speaker 1>You know we all have to get a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 1>drinks.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I could fuck a talk.</v>

273
00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:23.320
<v Speaker 1>So you can't hold those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those pauses to them.</v>

274
00:12:23.321 --> 00:12:27.530
<v Speaker 1>It's like the green light fucking queer</v>
<v Speaker 1>that can help.</v>

275
00:12:27.531 --> 00:12:28.610
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't help it.</v>

276
00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:31.420
<v Speaker 1>Those big juicy pauses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just this opening.</v>

277
00:12:31.421 --> 00:12:33.220
<v Speaker 1>They could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they could say something funny too,</v>

278
00:12:33.221 --> 00:12:36.640
<v Speaker 1>like when it happens in a movie theater,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of the time it's retarded.</v>

279
00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:39.510
<v Speaker 1>But every now and then someone will yell</v>
<v Speaker 1>something out in a movie theater and</v>

280
00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:41.680
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

281
00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:42.970
<v Speaker 1>And then that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

282
00:12:42.971 --> 00:12:46.120
<v Speaker 1>he becomes a hero for that crowd.</v>

<v Speaker 1>sporting event.</v>

284
00:12:48.491 --> 00:12:52.000
<v Speaker 1>So like now we'd like to take a moment</v>
<v Speaker 1>of silence for all the victims.</v>

00:12:52.070 --> 00:12:55.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>ever done?</v>

330
00:14:48.341 --> 00:14:49.690
<v Speaker 1>It was probably like hundreds of</v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands.</v>

331
00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:52.370
<v Speaker 1>The original family that owned the New</v>
<v Speaker 1>England</v>

332
00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:56.270
<v Speaker 2>patriots,</v>

333
00:14:56.270 --> 00:14:58.540
<v Speaker 2>Jackson victory tour when he went out</v>

335
00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:03.710
<v Speaker 2>the sun put the thing together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't know if this is true,</v>

336
00:15:03.830 --> 00:15:07.130
<v Speaker 2>so I got to preface this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a promoter in Boston told me this</v>

337
00:15:07.131 --> 00:15:10.070
<v Speaker 2>cold forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like Michael Jackson was going to go to</v>

338
00:15:10.071 --> 00:15:13.850
<v Speaker 2>Foxboro stadium with a patriots were</v>
<v Speaker 2>playing and they promoted the show and</v>

339
00:15:13.851 --> 00:15:15.890
<v Speaker 2>all the tickets and he had that would of</v>
<v Speaker 2>pay or play,</v>

340
00:15:15.891 --> 00:15:16.790
<v Speaker 2>whatever they call,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no matter what,</v>

341
00:15:16.791 --> 00:15:19.490
<v Speaker 2>you got to pay the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the town of Foxborough said,</v>

342

<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't want to show,</v>

343
00:15:21.591 --> 00:15:23.270
<v Speaker 2>we don't want all these black people</v>
<v Speaker 2>coming out here.</v>

344
00:15:23.630 --> 00:15:24.920
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what it was.</v>

345
00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:28.340
<v Speaker 2>That's what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the white people got too crazy on</v>

346
00:15:28.341 --> 00:15:31.250
<v Speaker 2>Monday night and they stopped having</v>
<v Speaker 2>Monday night football for like 20 years.</v>

347
00:15:31.251 --> 00:15:33.710
<v Speaker 2>Like FoxPro was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then we're not having this really,</v>

348
00:15:33.711 --> 00:15:37.700
<v Speaker 2>this is a quiet little town,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have you football game during the day on</v>

349
00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:38.750
<v Speaker 2>Sunday and then get the fuck out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

350
00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:41.070
<v Speaker 2>So they canceled the show and I thought</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

351
00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:45.530
<v Speaker 2>the amount of money lost on that show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were close enough that that brought</v>

352
00:15:45.531 --> 00:15:48.980
<v Speaker 2>him under.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what this promoted was claiming was</v>

353
00:15:48.981 --> 00:15:50.870
<v Speaker 2>this guy actually promoted the whole</v>
<v Speaker 2>tour.</v>

354
00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:54.740
<v Speaker 2>And when he was doing the finances,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he didn't take into consideration how</v>

355
00:15:54.741 --> 00:15:58.760
<v Speaker 2>big Michael Jackson stage was and how</v>
<v Speaker 2>many seats that that was going to eat</v>

356
00:15:58.761 --> 00:16:01.640
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had this giant ass fucking stage that</v>

357
00:16:01.641 --> 00:16:05.150
<v Speaker 2>was eating up like tens of thousands of</v>
<v Speaker 2>dollars a night times all of these</v>

358
00:16:05.151 --> 00:16:07.220
<v Speaker 2>fucking dates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when he tried to get him go,</v>

359
00:16:07.221 --> 00:16:08.930
<v Speaker 2>Hey Mike,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you just have a smaller stage,</v>

360
00:16:08.931 --> 00:16:11.990
<v Speaker 2>blah blah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess he was competing with Prince and</v>

361
00:16:11.991 --> 00:16:14.420
<v Speaker 2>was saying like now cause if I have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>smallest stage,</v>

362
00:16:14.421 --> 00:16:17.300
<v Speaker 2>prince will have a bigger stage and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>got to make sure my shit is bigger than</v>

363
00:16:17.301 --> 00:16:19.280
<v Speaker 2>his.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course you said that in a falsetto,</v>

364
00:16:19.281 --> 00:16:20.150
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if this is true.</v>

365
00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:21.890
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like this is the story of this guy</v>

366
00:16:21.891 --> 00:16:23.510
<v Speaker 2>told me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it blew my mind.</v>

367
00:16:23.511 --> 00:16:28.310
<v Speaker 2>I was like Oh I always thought they went</v>
<v Speaker 2>broke on just on one fucking date that</v>

368
00:16:28.311 --> 00:16:31.520
<v Speaker 2>he canceled that and I just figured you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know there's 60,000 people there.</v>

369
00:16:31.521 --> 00:16:34.730
<v Speaker 2>That's what reminded me talking about</v>
<v Speaker 2>60,000 people all paid that money and he</v>

370
00:16:34.731 --> 00:16:36.650
<v Speaker 2>still had to give him a cut of that and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just didn't have it.</v>

371
00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:40.430
<v Speaker 2>That actually does make sense that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>the size of the stage thing.</v>

372
00:16:40.431 --> 00:16:42.290
<v Speaker 2>That totally makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

373
00:16:42.291 --> 00:16:45.260
<v Speaker 2>Cause there's a comedy club that did</v>
<v Speaker 2>that in New York where they,</v>

374
00:16:45.261 --> 00:16:48.680
<v Speaker 2>for some reason they moved the stage out</v>
<v Speaker 2>away from the wall and now this little</v>

375
00:16:48.681 --> 00:16:51.950
<v Speaker 2>small club and they moved it away from</v>
<v Speaker 2>the wall so the waitresses could walk</v>

376
00:16:51.951 --> 00:16:55.400
<v Speaker 2>behind the stage behind this wall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like they took out like five or six</v>

377
00:16:55.401 --> 00:16:59.300
<v Speaker 2>tables and all the other comedy clubs</v>
<v Speaker 2>were laughing and they figured out how</v>

378
00:16:59.301 --> 00:17:02.060
<v Speaker 2>much money they fucked themselves out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>over the course of a year.</v>

379
00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:03.800
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing shows two or three shows a night</v>

380
00:17:03.801 --> 00:17:04.880
<v Speaker 2>times six,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seven days.</v>

381
00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:08.150
<v Speaker 2>Like they were fucking themselves out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>like three quarters of a million dollars</v>

382
00:17:08.151 --> 00:17:09.950
<v Speaker 2>a year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they hadn't,</v>

383
00:17:10.340 --> 00:17:12.440
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they ended up having to move the wall.</v>

384
00:17:12.441 --> 00:17:14.510
<v Speaker 2>Those fucking hilarious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody from day one is just like,</v>

385
00:17:14.511 --> 00:17:17.510
<v Speaker 2>this is stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was already one of those rooms that</v>

386
00:17:17.511 --> 00:17:19.460
<v Speaker 2>was kind of shape.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not to celebrate was shaped like</v>

387
00:17:19.461 --> 00:17:22.580
<v Speaker 2>the seller where it's like you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>standing sideways in a rectangle.</v>

388
00:17:22.970 --> 00:17:26.390
<v Speaker 2>So you kinda got to angle yourself and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they took that shit and moved you</v>

389
00:17:26.391 --> 00:17:30.350
<v Speaker 2>further into the crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was almost like a year in the</v>

390
00:17:30.351 --> 00:17:31.550
<v Speaker 2>round almost.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

391
00:17:31.551 --> 00:17:33.980
<v Speaker 2>but only on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the people who are at two sides,</v>

392
00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:35.810
<v Speaker 2>this is a place like that in San</v>
<v Speaker 2>Francisco.</v>

393
00:17:35.811 --> 00:17:37.280
<v Speaker 2>There's a theater that I did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like that.</v>

394
00:17:37.281 --> 00:17:39.560
<v Speaker 2>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You walk the stage goes out into the</v>

395
00:17:39.561 --> 00:17:41.870
<v Speaker 2>crowd and like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so people are behind you.</v>

396
00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:43.910
<v Speaker 2>And to the left and behind you and to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the right.</v>

397
00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:46.220
<v Speaker 2>It's very strange.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You did that thing with me,</v>

398
00:17:46.221 --> 00:17:46.591
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

399
00:17:46.591 --> 00:17:47.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was weird.</v>

400
00:17:47.910 --> 00:17:49.660
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that you have,</v>

401
00:17:49.661 --> 00:17:51.420
<v Speaker 2>I want to be sitting behind a</v>
<v Speaker 2>performance.</v>

402
00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:53.640
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I'm doing a theater in the round</v>

403
00:17:53.641 --> 00:17:54.660
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Phoenix.</v>

404
00:17:54.810 --> 00:17:56.160
<v Speaker 2>Just collaborative theater.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

405
00:17:56.161 --> 00:18:00.120
<v Speaker 2>Just cause it would be weird now that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>do it five times before you do,</v>

406
00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:01.351
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've done this before.</v>

407
00:18:01.351 --> 00:18:06.351
<v Speaker 2>I just start the joke on this side and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then turn an end on that side and I just</v>

408
00:18:06.601 --> 00:18:11.601
<v Speaker 2>really try to be conscious of sections.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like Dane said,</v>

409
00:18:11.881 --> 00:18:13.340
<v Speaker 2>the most brilliant thing about the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

410
00:18:13.341 --> 00:18:14.640
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the theater in the round,</v>

411
00:18:14.641 --> 00:18:15.930
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's for theaters.</v>

412
00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:18.660
<v Speaker 2>Just look at it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's four theaters just all stuck</v>

413
00:18:18.661 --> 00:18:21.140
<v Speaker 2>together and you just sorta performing</v>
<v Speaker 2>one theater.</v>

414
00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:23.910
<v Speaker 2>Then this one and then that went over</v>
<v Speaker 2>there and then I just think you do it</v>

415
00:18:23.911 --> 00:18:24.744
<v Speaker 2>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

416
00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:27.570
<v Speaker 2>the three card Monte,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he just sort of switch it up like you</v>

417
00:18:27.571 --> 00:18:28.340
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

418
00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:28.770
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

419
00:18:28.770 --> 00:18:29.910
<v Speaker 2>As you go around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I know,</v>

420
00:18:30.090 --> 00:18:33.690
<v Speaker 2>I know people that have seen comics I'll</v>
<v Speaker 2>do is theater in the round.</v>

421
00:18:33.691 --> 00:18:36.360
<v Speaker 2>They'll be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so and so was here and he didn't move</v>

422
00:18:36.361 --> 00:18:37.141
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not One of those comics,</v>

423
00:18:37.141 --> 00:18:39.240
<v Speaker 2>it's just standing with the mic and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>mic stand.</v>

424
00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:43.050
<v Speaker 2>So they were in the back and just</v>
<v Speaker 2>sitting there and one of them had like a</v>

425
00:18:43.051 --> 00:18:46.770
<v Speaker 2>slow turning stage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So eventually you just send that dude 20</v>

426
00:18:46.771 --> 00:18:48.560
<v Speaker 2>more jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's going to be looking at us.</v>

427
00:18:48.561 --> 00:18:53.190
<v Speaker 2>So he made the stage turn while they</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a stage that turns.</v>

428
00:18:53.191 --> 00:18:56.490
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's for musical acts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have a drama drunk kid in amps</v>

429
00:18:56.820 --> 00:18:58.410
<v Speaker 2>planted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they're not moving,</v>

430
00:18:58.411 --> 00:19:01.650
<v Speaker 2>but it's also for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think like performance who just want</v>

431
00:19:01.651 --> 00:19:05.540
<v Speaker 2>to stand there and not move around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fun around like they're wrote a</v>

432
00:19:05.550 --> 00:19:08.190
<v Speaker 2>fucking carousel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You did that one very slowly.</v>

433
00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:10.830
<v Speaker 2>Very slowly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It spins around the one that turns</v>

434
00:19:10.831 --> 00:19:11.730
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

435
00:19:11.731 --> 00:19:13.840
<v Speaker 2>But it turns very slowly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very slowly.</v>

436
00:19:13.841 --> 00:19:14.990
<v Speaker 2>It's the same place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

437
00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:16.770
<v Speaker 2>The celebrity theater.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the one we're talking about.</v>

438
00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:18.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forgot that it turns.</v>

439
00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:19.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they asked me the option,</v>

440
00:19:19.501 --> 00:19:21.800
<v Speaker 2>do you want the stage turned on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

441
00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:24.870
<v Speaker 2>I'm definitely gonna say yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

442
00:19:24.871 --> 00:19:26.280
<v Speaker 2>I always say no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like I don't need,</v>

443
00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:28.020
<v Speaker 2>I don't need that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to just for,</v>

444
00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:29.970
<v Speaker 2>cause it's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

445
00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:32.640
<v Speaker 2>Well if they can speed it up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could literally just be running in</v>

446
00:19:32.641 --> 00:19:34.770
<v Speaker 2>place doing a whole fucking choke</v>
<v Speaker 2>running against it.</v>

447
00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:36.780
<v Speaker 2>My goal is to do so many shots while</v>
<v Speaker 2>months,</v>

448
00:19:36.790 --> 00:19:39.780
<v Speaker 2>days that I can't figure out where the</v>
<v Speaker 2>stool is at any given time.</v>

449
00:19:39.781 --> 00:19:41.400
<v Speaker 2>It can be anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's moving around.</v>

450
00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:43.470
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I was going to say,</v>

451
00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:47.110
<v Speaker 2>no way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been drunk twice on stage.</v>

452
00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:49.830
<v Speaker 2>It was twice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>twice and 20 something years.</v>

453
00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:52.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not the best move every now and</v>

454
00:19:52.411 --> 00:19:54.330
<v Speaker 2>then though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the right thing to do once I was in</v>

455
00:19:54.331 --> 00:19:55.980
<v Speaker 2>Ireland.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's not my fault.</v>

456
00:19:56.880 --> 00:20:00.090
<v Speaker 2>And the other time I was coming back</v>
<v Speaker 2>from a Yankees Red Sox game and didn't</v>

457
00:20:00.091 --> 00:20:02.160
<v Speaker 2>know it was going to have a show and</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody called up,</v>

458
00:20:02.161 --> 00:20:03.000
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a falling out,</v>

459
00:20:03.001 --> 00:20:07.020
<v Speaker 2>can you come down and do the show?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I thought it was sober.</v>

460
00:20:07.050 --> 00:20:07.801
<v Speaker 2>One of those like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

461
00:20:07.801 --> 00:20:08.211
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll do it.</v>

462
00:20:08.211 --> 00:20:09.300
<v Speaker 2>And I just went up there and I was just</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

463
00:20:09.301 --> 00:20:09.780
<v Speaker 2>she's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

464
00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:11.370
<v Speaker 2>should I heard?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was just like,</v>

465
00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:15.360
<v Speaker 2>oh shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had to slow way down and had a very,</v>

466
00:20:15.361 --> 00:20:19.200
<v Speaker 2>very uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>subpar fucking shows bad.</v>

467
00:20:19.470 --> 00:20:22.080
<v Speaker 2>So you had a slow way down just to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>your mouth to work right?</v>

468
00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:24.270
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which killed the timing of everything.</v>

469
00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:26.910
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bombed very slowly.</v>

470
00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:30.390
<v Speaker 2>I see that with um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the term punch drunk.</v>

471
00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:32.700
<v Speaker 2>That's like a term that people don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>like.</v>

472
00:20:33.030 --> 00:20:34.950
<v Speaker 2>But that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's exactly what it's like.</v>

473
00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:39.030
<v Speaker 2>That same thing where you know you're a</v>
<v Speaker 2>little fucked up so you have to struggle</v>

474
00:20:39.031 --> 00:20:41.730
<v Speaker 2>to get your words out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you could see that in fighters it's</v>

475
00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:44.400
<v Speaker 2>exact same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's why they call it punch drunk.</v>

476
00:20:44.401 --> 00:20:45.750
<v Speaker 2>It's not just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they sound like they're drunk,</v>

477
00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:48.130
<v Speaker 2>but the same thing like you have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>struggle</v>

478
00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:52.090
<v Speaker 1>to control your situation and then when</v>
<v Speaker 1>those guys get drunk,</v>

479
00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:55.800
<v Speaker 1>that's when you see guys that are really</v>
<v Speaker 1>punched drunk guys that had been punched</v>

480
00:20:55.801 --> 00:20:59.110
<v Speaker 1>drunk get drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause then you see they have a hard side</v>

481
00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:03.010
<v Speaker 1>because they have a really hard time</v>
<v Speaker 1>controlling the words then that it's</v>

482
00:21:03.011 --> 00:21:04.840
<v Speaker 1>just a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a mangled mess.</v>

483
00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:07.140
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to understand the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that</v>

484
00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:09.120
<v Speaker 2>that UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the a,</v>

485
00:21:09.121 --> 00:21:11.020
<v Speaker 2>what do you call when they stick them in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the house and all that shit.</v>

486
00:21:11.050 --> 00:21:13.390
<v Speaker 2>Ultimate fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ultimate fighter and it's all women.</v>

487
00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:15.580
<v Speaker 2>And like I remember last time I did your</v>
<v Speaker 2>podcast,</v>

488
00:21:15.581 --> 00:21:18.430
<v Speaker 2>I was against it like women in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>octagon.</v>

489
00:21:18.431 --> 00:21:20.560
<v Speaker 2>It's like they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they like why would you do that?</v>

490
00:21:20.561 --> 00:21:22.420
<v Speaker 2>They're beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why would you punch each other in the</v>

491
00:21:22.421 --> 00:21:23.750
<v Speaker 2>face?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I want to see a jab.</v>

492
00:21:23.751 --> 00:21:25.090
<v Speaker 2>Do you have breasts and shed?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

493
00:21:25.091 --> 00:21:28.690
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to see it and now I don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>even notice it anymore.</v>

494
00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:31.390
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's unbelievably fucking entertaining.</v>

495
00:21:33.010 --> 00:21:37.870
<v Speaker 2>You don't notice that the girls anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I know they're great fights and it's</v>

496
00:21:37.871 --> 00:21:41.020
<v Speaker 2>guys who are already good at talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit and fucking not liking each other,</v>

497
00:21:41.021 --> 00:21:43.570
<v Speaker 2>but they're just women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just take it to that extra fucking</v>

498
00:21:43.571 --> 00:21:45.790
<v Speaker 2>level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that shit talking.</v>

499
00:21:45.791 --> 00:21:47.860
<v Speaker 2>And then the fact that they can beat the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck out of you.</v>

500
00:21:48.010 --> 00:21:51.850
<v Speaker 2>And then it's funny there's a guy to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>just watching it going like there is not</v>

501
00:21:51.851 --> 00:21:54.430
<v Speaker 2>one woman in this house that I could</v>
<v Speaker 2>even get on the floor.</v>

502
00:21:54.550 --> 00:21:57.400
<v Speaker 2>Like these women would all just mop the</v>
<v Speaker 2>floor with me.</v>

503
00:21:57.700 --> 00:22:00.100
<v Speaker 2>There's a fucking hilarious youtube</v>
<v Speaker 2>video.</v>

504
00:22:00.610 --> 00:22:02.370
<v Speaker 2>Somebody tweeted it to me and I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

505
00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:05.230
<v Speaker 2>I just lost it in the ether.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was this girl,</v>

506
00:22:05.231 --> 00:22:07.330
<v Speaker 2>it just starts writing in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was almost one of those six second</v>

507
00:22:07.331 --> 00:22:08.950
<v Speaker 2>videos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever the fucking kids call him.</v>

508
00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:11.860
<v Speaker 2>And you knew this kid had a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 2>of training and this girl had more</v>

509
00:22:11.861 --> 00:22:15.190
<v Speaker 2>training and she came at him and it was</v>
<v Speaker 2>like she climbed up his body,</v>

510
00:22:15.550 --> 00:22:18.790
<v Speaker 2>like stepped on his fucking thigh and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then was behind them.</v>

511
00:22:18.970 --> 00:22:21.220
<v Speaker 2>And the video ends with him just</v>
<v Speaker 2>grabbing like,</v>

512
00:22:21.221 --> 00:22:22.720
<v Speaker 2>this is its rear naked girl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

513
00:22:22.721 --> 00:22:25.330
<v Speaker 2>he was out before he went and the whole</v>
<v Speaker 2>Party just goes,</v>

514
00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:28.960
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it ends and I fucking died laughing.</v>

515
00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:33.610
<v Speaker 2>But going like I wouldn't even have</v>
<v Speaker 2>lasted as long is that kid did.</v>

516
00:22:33.611 --> 00:22:37.000
<v Speaker 2>Cause it seemed like he knew a little</v>
<v Speaker 2>bit of a defense.</v>

517
00:22:37.030 --> 00:22:40.000
<v Speaker 2>A little bit of defense like I have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>great Rhonda Rousey.</v>

518
00:22:40.001 --> 00:22:43.660
<v Speaker 2>Bit of like what it would be like to</v>
<v Speaker 2>date her if she was actually physically</v>

519
00:22:43.661 --> 00:22:45.910
<v Speaker 2>abusive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I just can't do the prat fall.</v>

520
00:22:46.570 --> 00:22:48.250
<v Speaker 2>I want to act like you know her big</v>
<v Speaker 2>movies.</v>

521
00:22:48.270 --> 00:22:52.870
<v Speaker 2>She does that fucking throw and you go</v>
<v Speaker 2>over a hip and just you fucking landed</v>

522
00:22:52.871 --> 00:22:55.150
<v Speaker 2>on the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're like in a relationship with her.</v>

523
00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:59.890
<v Speaker 2>Oh our bar real mature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Showing you like I know I tapped out.</v>

524
00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:03.340
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't mean because you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want my heart broken and then</v>

525
00:23:03.341 --> 00:23:05.350
<v Speaker 2>she comes out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to knock down the stool to try</v>

526
00:23:05.351 --> 00:23:06.670
<v Speaker 2>to have something in between you and</v>
<v Speaker 2>her.</v>

527
00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:09.660
<v Speaker 1>I think it took like that probably has</v>
<v Speaker 1>to date a fighter.</v>

528
00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:13.620
<v Speaker 1>If I had to guess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She probably has to date some guy who</v>

529
00:23:13.621 --> 00:23:16.200
<v Speaker 1>also knows how to do what she does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just couldn't imagine</v>

530
00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:20.050
<v Speaker 2>Jen a fight data.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd be on the kitchen like an apron just</v>

531
00:23:20.051 --> 00:23:22.290
<v Speaker 2>like make her an her food and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just couldn't get me.</v>

532
00:23:22.370 --> 00:23:24.130
<v Speaker 2>Look at me sideways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd fuck me up.</v>

533
00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:26.950
<v Speaker 1>Almost every female fighter does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They all date fighters.</v>

534
00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:29.080
<v Speaker 1>They just does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just seems like,</v>

535
00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:32.590
<v Speaker 1>you know a girl being in a position like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that where she could just beat the fuck</v>

536
00:23:32.591 --> 00:23:34.480
<v Speaker 1>out of her boyfriend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think chicks like that.</v>

537
00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:37.680
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never looked at it that way cause I</v>

538
00:23:37.681 --> 00:23:39.160
<v Speaker 2>always thought it was hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I,</v>

539
00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:40.980
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could date somebody like that.</v>

540
00:23:40.981 --> 00:23:43.620
<v Speaker 2>I would think it was funny that they can</v>
<v Speaker 2>kick the shit and one of my guy friends</v>

541
00:23:43.621 --> 00:23:44.371
<v Speaker 2>gave me shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd be like,</v>

542
00:23:44.371 --> 00:23:45.500
<v Speaker 2>yeah man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she kicked shit out of me.</v>

543
00:23:45.501 --> 00:23:47.660
<v Speaker 2>And you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's funny but like I never</v>

544
00:23:47.661 --> 00:23:50.780
<v Speaker 2>looked at it like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause even though they are like,</v>

545
00:23:51.170 --> 00:23:56.090
<v Speaker 2>like these lethal weapons now there is</v>
<v Speaker 2>still there could possibly still I</v>

546
00:23:56.091 --> 00:23:57.560
<v Speaker 2>should say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to speak for him that this</v>

547
00:23:57.561 --> 00:24:02.150
<v Speaker 2>female male relationship where that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>still want the guy to be able to protect</v>

548
00:24:02.151 --> 00:24:06.020
<v Speaker 2>them and it's just kind of like uh yeah</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude that's funny.</v>

549
00:24:06.021 --> 00:24:08.210
<v Speaker 2>Cause then they're just sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>rendering you useless cause they're</v>

550
00:24:08.211 --> 00:24:11.300
<v Speaker 2>already making a zillion dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there goes your on providing I can</v>

551
00:24:11.301 --> 00:24:13.010
<v Speaker 2>protect you and do what I can kick your</v>
<v Speaker 2>ass.</v>

552
00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:17.720
<v Speaker 2>And then I can also have a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're basically now like a 45 year</v>

553
00:24:17.721 --> 00:24:21.400
<v Speaker 2>old teenager,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which just gives you a little height</v>

554
00:24:21.410 --> 00:24:23.640
<v Speaker 2>chair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I like about watching it?</v>

555
00:24:23.641 --> 00:24:26.720
<v Speaker 2>Like self sustained unit?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's fucking awesome.</v>

556
00:24:26.930 --> 00:24:29.010
<v Speaker 2>What I like about watching female fights</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the,</v>

557
00:24:29.011 --> 00:24:32.810
<v Speaker 2>they're more reliant on technique</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they don't have overwhelming</v>

558
00:24:32.811 --> 00:24:35.930
<v Speaker 2>physical strength,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there are certain guys that have</v>

559
00:24:35.931 --> 00:24:40.070
<v Speaker 2>overwhelming physical strength and</v>
<v Speaker 2>abilities you can plow through.</v>

560
00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:41.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They could just defects in that game.</v>

561
00:24:41.790 --> 00:24:43.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can muscle things.</v>

562
00:24:43.551 --> 00:24:45.410
<v Speaker 2>They can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just hit really hard.</v>

563
00:24:45.530 --> 00:24:47.420
<v Speaker 2>So sometimes they have like shitty</v>
<v Speaker 2>technique.</v>

564
00:24:47.421 --> 00:24:50.480
<v Speaker 2>They throw windmill punches,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but with a lot of women,</v>

565
00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:53.840
<v Speaker 2>what you're getting is you're getting</v>
<v Speaker 2>the purest technique.</v>

566
00:24:53.841 --> 00:24:54.390
<v Speaker 2>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

567
00:24:54.390 --> 00:24:58.570
<v Speaker 2>it</v>
<v Speaker 2>depends on where you're head is a</v>

568
00:24:58.571 --> 00:25:01.090
<v Speaker 2>gentleman with my opponent given plenty</v>
<v Speaker 2>of time to see it coming</v>

569
00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:05.750
<v Speaker 2>and let them know the couches are always</v>
<v Speaker 2>coming from the same direction.</v>

570
00:25:06.170 --> 00:25:08.240
<v Speaker 2>If he see the left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the next one's the right.</v>

571
00:25:08.510 --> 00:25:09.720
<v Speaker 2>Have you see the right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The next one?</v>

572
00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:12.050

<v Speaker 2>What's fucking dumb?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're less linear story.</v>

577
00:25:20.150 --> 00:25:21.570
<v Speaker 2>But with checks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

578
00:25:21.571 --> 00:25:24.740
<v Speaker 2>they're forced to use more tech mean the</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously there's,</v>

579
00:25:24.950 --> 00:25:28.760
<v Speaker 2>there's a curve as far as like physical</v>
<v Speaker 2>strength is like someone like Serena</v>

580
00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:30.470
<v Speaker 2>Williams.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So obviously a very physically strong</v>

581
00:25:30.471 --> 00:25:33.560
<v Speaker 2>girl and there's other girls that are</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>throw me over a couch and you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>and the strength that she has,</v>

585
00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:47.030
<v Speaker 2>I was at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was at a party one time,</v>

586
00:25:47.031 --> 00:25:49.160

587
00:25:49.161 --> 00:25:51.980
<v Speaker 2>also represented her and you forget your</v>
<v Speaker 2>agency also represents,</v>

588
00:25:51.981 --> 00:25:53.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>athletes cause they want to like</v>

600
00:26:15.471 --> 00:26:19.620
<v Speaker 2>you should be wearing a fucking cape.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just,</v>

601
00:26:20.210 --> 00:26:20.810
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's just,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just see people like that and you</v>

<v Speaker 2>just go like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>

604
00:26:24.051 --> 00:26:26.770
<v Speaker 2>that's why like you always sit there in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the back of your head as you watching</v>

605
00:26:26.780 --> 00:26:28.100
<v Speaker 2>some quarterback.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That sucks.</v>

606
00:26:28.430 --> 00:26:31.910
<v Speaker 2>What if I did some more setups?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if I get thrown against my body</v>

607
00:26:31.911 --> 00:26:34.130
<v Speaker 2>like fucking Brett far,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not throw an interception.</v>

608
00:26:34.131 --> 00:26:36.110
<v Speaker 2>And then you actually run into the real</v>
<v Speaker 2>athletes do.</v>

609
00:26:36.111 --> 00:26:38.810
<v Speaker 2>When I saw Joe Theismann who always</v>
<v Speaker 2>looked like a little fella,</v>

610
00:26:39.260 --> 00:26:40.041
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he was out there,</v>

611
00:26:40.041 --> 00:26:42.200
<v Speaker 2>he had the one little bar here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he got his leg broken.</v>

612
00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:43.920
<v Speaker 2>He just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he always looked just so small.</v>

613
00:26:43.921 --> 00:26:47.130
<v Speaker 2>When he was out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw the guy and like in a mall,</v>

614
00:26:47.310 --> 00:26:51.870
<v Speaker 2>he's like six one in like still jacked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like almost five,</v>

615
00:26:51.871 --> 00:26:52.800
<v Speaker 2>10.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going like,</v>

616
00:26:52.801 --> 00:26:55.230
<v Speaker 2>this guy would fucking drop me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How did he,</v>

617
00:26:55.231 --> 00:26:56.970
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did he get his leg fixed to,</v>

618
00:26:56.971 --> 00:27:00.340
<v Speaker 2>they put bars in it and pins and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like how did he get his legs fixed?</v>

619
00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:02.300
<v Speaker 2>I imagine I haven't been in contact with</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

620
00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:06.600
<v Speaker 2>did anybody at the hospital,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did that end his career?</v>

621
00:27:06.601 --> 00:27:07.520
<v Speaker 2>That was my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my question.</v>

622
00:27:07.521 --> 00:27:09.740
<v Speaker 2>Yes it did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the last play he watched.</v>

623
00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:11.340
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm on what time you said he watched the</v>

624
00:27:11.341 --> 00:27:13.710
<v Speaker 2>replay one time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

625
00:27:13.711 --> 00:27:15.370
<v Speaker 2>and that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was it for him and uh,</v>

626
00:27:15.410 --> 00:27:19.230
<v Speaker 2>and I actually win a silver,</v>
<v Speaker 2>broke his leg.</v>

627
00:27:19.231 --> 00:27:22.500
<v Speaker 2>I think that reminded me of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that compound fracture of just like,</v>

628
00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:23.460
<v Speaker 2>oh my God.</v>

629
00:27:23.490 --> 00:27:26.910
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't even imagine the pain.</v>

630
00:27:26.911 --> 00:27:30.540
<v Speaker 2>And then going into the shock.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the fact now is he's coming</v>

631
00:27:30.541 --> 00:27:31.650
<v Speaker 2>back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right Silva's.</v>

632
00:27:31.651 --> 00:27:36.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>January is to fucking sit there after</v>

633
00:27:36.061 --> 00:27:39.270
<v Speaker 2>you went through that and to just the</v>
<v Speaker 2>first time you start throwing kicks with</v>

634
00:27:39.271 --> 00:27:43.410
<v Speaker 2>that leg again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just like the level of whatever that is.</v>

635
00:27:43.950 --> 00:27:48.540
<v Speaker 2>I don't have that anywhere in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if I ever fucking broke my leg like</v>

636
00:27:48.541 --> 00:27:50.430
<v Speaker 2>that doing stand up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>

637
00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:51.280
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would be,</v>

638
00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:53.940
<v Speaker 2>I'd open a comedy club used to go up on</v>
<v Speaker 2>stage.</v>

639
00:27:53.950 --> 00:27:55.500
<v Speaker 2>I know I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to do that anymore.</v>

640
00:27:55.850 --> 00:28:00.500
<v Speaker 1>He's at the end of his career.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got a few years left fighting and</v>

641
00:28:00.501 --> 00:28:02.000
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has an opportunity to still make a</v>

642
00:28:02.001 --> 00:28:05.300
<v Speaker 1>lot of money and I think he's probably</v>
<v Speaker 1>just going to make as much money as you</v>

643
00:28:05.301 --> 00:28:07.040
<v Speaker 1>can over the next few years and then get</v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

644
00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:08.210
<v Speaker 1>Now what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is the,</v>

645
00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:10.820
<v Speaker 1>that that rumor that I hear that if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>break a bone,</v>

646
00:28:10.970 --> 00:28:14.720
<v Speaker 1>this is such a bother heal stronger and</v>
<v Speaker 1>heal stronger to sort of,</v>

647
00:28:14.810 --> 00:28:18.200
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's less likely to break in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>area where it broke.</v>

648
00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:21.610
<v Speaker 1>It's less likely to break there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It gets knotted up and thick,</v>

649
00:28:21.620 --> 00:28:24.380
<v Speaker 1>but not necessarily sure it gets</v>
<v Speaker 1>stronger.</v>

650
00:28:24.410 --> 00:28:26.780
<v Speaker 1>Thank you doctor Brogan and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why am I asking you these fucking</v>

00:30:01.331 --> 00:30:04.090
<v Speaker 1>likes to make fun of himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did he go out and talk to the bear and</v>

687
00:30:04.091 --> 00:30:06.010
<v Speaker 1>ask him what he's doing to get those</v>
<v Speaker 1>back muscles?</v>

688
00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:10.360
<v Speaker 1>He would</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost as big as mine.</v>

689
00:30:11.130 --> 00:30:12.430
<v Speaker 1>I got mad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to find out.</v>

690
00:30:12.730 --> 00:30:15.580
<v Speaker 1>But we were for five days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I walked around on all fours and</v>

691
00:30:15.581 --> 00:30:17.860
<v Speaker 1>occasionally stood up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like a beer.</v>

692
00:30:17.861 --> 00:30:20.080
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like a bear without all that</v>
<v Speaker 1>hair.</v>

693
00:30:24.010 --> 00:30:25.450
<v Speaker 1>Five days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every time.</v>

694
00:30:25.510 --> 00:30:29.050
<v Speaker 1>It's just constantly the Brian Count</v>
<v Speaker 1>show cause you could just wind them up.</v>

695
00:30:29.051 --> 00:30:30.820
<v Speaker 1>He's just that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's always on.</v>

696
00:30:30.821 --> 00:30:32.590
<v Speaker 1>He's never not funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he's never,</v>

697
00:30:32.830 --> 00:30:34.210
<v Speaker 1>I never called Bryon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's depressed,</v>

698
00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:36.910
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If he is depressed and be depressed for</v>

699
00:30:36.911 --> 00:30:40.060
<v Speaker 1>a couple of minutes and then it'll just</v>
<v Speaker 1>start talking about something and it'll</v>

700
00:30:40.061 --> 00:30:45.061
<v Speaker 1>tell you start talking about lean muscle</v>
<v Speaker 1>mass or how he's built for dance and</v>

701
00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:49.540
<v Speaker 1>he'll just go into something and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>next thing you know you're laughing.</v>

702
00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:52.060
<v Speaker 1>He just doesn't want that uncomfortable</v>
<v Speaker 1>silence.</v>

703
00:30:52.630 --> 00:30:53.351
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

704
00:30:53.351 --> 00:30:57.460
<v Speaker 1>what's his face at the end of the hulk?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Feel big speed instead of walking away</v>

705
00:30:57.461 --> 00:30:59.740
<v Speaker 1>from the town.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those were his troubles.</v>

706
00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:02.180
<v Speaker 1>Do you know that the hulk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they changed.</v>

707
00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:05.200
<v Speaker 1>I just want to keep trashing him until</v>
<v Speaker 1>people show them this clip.</v>

708
00:31:05.950 --> 00:31:10.950
<v Speaker 1>Two I get on his show again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They changed the hoax name by the way,</v>

709
00:31:11.830 --> 00:31:14.450
<v Speaker 1>the piece of salt now that's from uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

710
00:31:14.451 --> 00:31:15.400
<v Speaker 1>the hippie warehouse.</v>

711
00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:20.140
<v Speaker 1>These ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the salt crystal lamps,</v>

712
00:31:20.141 --> 00:31:24.460
<v Speaker 1>they're supposed to and somehow or</v>
<v Speaker 1>another like generate positive ions and</v>

713
00:31:24.580 --> 00:31:27.010
<v Speaker 1>Salsify,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the air float through the air and make</v>

714
00:31:27.011 --> 00:31:28.930
<v Speaker 1>you feel better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They changed.</v>

715
00:31:29.230 --> 00:31:33.550
<v Speaker 1>Robert Banner was a bill Bixby</v>
<v Speaker 1>characters name on the hulk,</v>

716
00:31:33.610 --> 00:31:36.130
<v Speaker 1>but the real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the real name is Bruce Banner.</v>

717
00:31:36.150 --> 00:31:38.680
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they changed it from Bruce to Robert</v>

718
00:31:38.681 --> 00:31:43.330
<v Speaker 1>for TV because they thought Bruce is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>gaining Bruce.</v>

719
00:31:44.650 --> 00:31:46.990
<v Speaker 1>How did it bro?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You angry again?</v>

720
00:31:47.030 --> 00:31:48.310
<v Speaker 1>I'll get mad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

721
00:31:48.530 --> 00:31:53.140
<v Speaker 1>God Green last night it was don thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you ruined your pants again.</v>

722
00:31:53.740 --> 00:31:57.250
<v Speaker 1>Bruce become a gaming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like Bruce for the long.</v>

723
00:31:57.330 --> 00:31:59.260
<v Speaker 1>For the longest time it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know Bruce,</v>

724
00:31:59.950 --> 00:32:02.680
<v Speaker 1>I was going to say Bruce Jenner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I guess that's a bad example now.</v>

725
00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:05.740
<v Speaker 1>It was a good example a few years back</v>
<v Speaker 1>to that guy.</v>

726
00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:07.720
<v Speaker 1>What's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's such a good looking guy.</v>

727
00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:08.221
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

728
00:32:08.221 --> 00:32:09.880
<v Speaker 1>it was never anything wrong with his</v>
<v Speaker 1>nose.</v>

729
00:32:10.570 --> 00:32:12.490
<v Speaker 1>He's becoming a good looking older lady</v>
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

730
00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:14.620
<v Speaker 1>That's what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

731
00:32:14.621 --> 00:32:15.880
<v Speaker 1>God bless them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it makes him happy,</v>

732
00:32:16.810 --> 00:32:19.090
<v Speaker 1>God bless him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it makes him happy,</v>

733
00:32:19.180 --> 00:32:20.230
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't.</v>

734
00:32:20.540 --> 00:32:23.070
<v Speaker 1>Just watching people fucking age badly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

735
00:32:23.071 --> 00:32:25.630
<v Speaker 1>attack in their face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

736
00:32:25.930 --> 00:32:28.000
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird thing that people do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get,</v>

737
00:32:28.060 --> 00:32:31.060
<v Speaker 1>they want to change it and then they</v>
<v Speaker 1>think when they changed that it looks</v>

738
00:32:31.061 --> 00:32:32.770
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just looks different for the most</v>

739
00:32:32.771 --> 00:32:34.480
<v Speaker 1>part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much of a hug do you need if you're</v>

740
00:32:34.540 --> 00:32:38.920
<v Speaker 1>staring at your throat in the mirror,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like sideways holding America.</v>

741
00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:41.210
<v Speaker 1>And I don't like my Adam's apple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I don't think I've,</v>

742
00:32:41.211 --> 00:32:43.820
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what my Adam's apple look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't pick up my Adam's apple and a</v>

743
00:32:43.821 --> 00:32:46.250
<v Speaker 1>fucking lineup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I've ever looked at it.</v>

744
00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:49.940
<v Speaker 1>I think his deal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm just guessing is that he's</v>

745
00:32:49.941 --> 00:32:52.580
<v Speaker 1>probably transitioning to being a woman.</v>

746
00:32:52.970 --> 00:32:55.460
<v Speaker 1>If I had to guess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

747
00:32:55.550 --> 00:32:59.540
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a probably a pretty safe</v>
<v Speaker 1>estimate at this point.</v>

748
00:32:59.541 --> 00:33:01.880
<v Speaker 1>He's grown his hair long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His nails are long.</v>

749
00:33:01.881 --> 00:33:04.250
<v Speaker 1>He had is now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think he'll come back [inaudible]</v>

750
00:33:04.430 --> 00:33:07.770
<v Speaker 1>name or do you think he'll just got</v>
<v Speaker 1>fingernail Polish on now?</v>

751
00:33:07.771 --> 00:33:09.500
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think he'll,</v>

752
00:33:09.530 --> 00:33:11.750
<v Speaker 1>he'll uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'll,</v>

753
00:33:11.751 --> 00:33:12.890
<v Speaker 1>he'll go with a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

754
00:33:13.860 --> 00:33:16.480
<v Speaker 1>a new name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like three Cema.</v>

755
00:33:16.710 --> 00:33:17.301
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying,</v>

756
00:33:17.301 --> 00:33:22.301
<v Speaker 1>do you think he'll go hacky and just</v>
<v Speaker 1>make his name of feminine like Bill,</v>

757
00:33:22.430 --> 00:33:25.880
<v Speaker 1>Bill Arena?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Betty has a fucking full character</v>

758
00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:28.220
<v Speaker 1>that he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he becomes when it becomes,</v>

759
00:33:28.580 --> 00:33:29.580
<v Speaker 1>let me see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me put,</v>

760
00:33:29.660 --> 00:33:31.160
<v Speaker 1>bring it back up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bring it back up.</v>

761
00:33:31.161 --> 00:33:32.450
<v Speaker 1>Those nails.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

762
00:33:32.451 --> 00:33:34.040
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if this is fake,</v>

763
00:33:35.270 --> 00:33:37.040
<v Speaker 1>he looks like a Jennifer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think so?</v>

764
00:33:37.041 --> 00:33:39.170
<v Speaker 1>I would say Claudia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nah,</v>

765
00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:42.950
<v Speaker 1>he's not a Claudia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was going to say he looks like a</v>

766
00:33:42.951 --> 00:33:43.784
<v Speaker 1>Claudia.</v>

767
00:33:44.150 --> 00:33:45.860
<v Speaker 1>Look at him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got a cigarette.</v>

768
00:33:45.861 --> 00:33:48.680
<v Speaker 1>Susan or a Jennifer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's smoking cigarettes to</v>

769
00:33:51.050 --> 00:33:51.861
<v Speaker 1>look at him right here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

770
00:33:51.861 --> 00:33:54.200
<v Speaker 1>We all know gay people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're always smoking cigarettes.</v>

771
00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:58.850
<v Speaker 1>That's what is happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that looks like that's a pretty</v>

772
00:33:58.851 --> 00:34:00.590
<v Speaker 1>good picture of what he probably looks</v>
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>

773
00:34:01.070 --> 00:34:04.370
<v Speaker 1>He has like his lipstick on when no</v>
<v Speaker 1>one's looking and he's tucking.</v>

774
00:34:04.780 --> 00:34:07.910
<v Speaker 1>That's bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He looks like he looks like an older</v>

775
00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:10.970
<v Speaker 1>lead singer of a band and they're doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>the casino circuit.</v>

776
00:34:11.570 --> 00:34:14.780
<v Speaker 1>The earrings too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like he really,</v>

777
00:34:15.230 --> 00:34:19.730
<v Speaker 1>he seems to be coming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A woman seems to be becoming one good</v>

778
00:34:19.731 --> 00:34:20.241
<v Speaker 1>for him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

779
00:34:20.241 --> 00:34:25.241
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is a good time to be a lady</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a good time to be a transgender woman</v>

780
00:34:26.601 --> 00:34:27.740
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

781
00:34:27.741 --> 00:34:29.720
<v Speaker 1>people are more accepting of it than</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever before.</v>

782
00:34:30.140 --> 00:34:33.050
<v Speaker 1>It's a good time for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

783
00:34:33.051 --> 00:34:36.380
<v Speaker 1>I mean</v>
<v Speaker 1>it should,</v>

784
00:34:36.381 --> 00:34:37.280
<v Speaker 1>but it should bother you.</v>

785
00:34:37.790 --> 00:34:39.290
<v Speaker 1>It should not really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Should not.</v>

786
00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:41.900
<v Speaker 1>It should not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

787
00:34:41.930 --> 00:34:44.630
<v Speaker 1>having said that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate the color of his nail Polish.</v>

788
00:34:44.660 --> 00:34:47.720
<v Speaker 1>The red is my favorite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like if you're going to fail,</v>

789
00:34:47.721 --> 00:34:50.930
<v Speaker 1>he's that he's that type that's too racy</v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

790
00:34:50.931 --> 00:34:53.870
<v Speaker 1>I don't mind it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's an Olympic medalist.</v>

791
00:34:54.890 --> 00:34:57.470
<v Speaker 1>What do you think you should have black</v>
<v Speaker 1>go golf.</v>

792
00:34:59.030 --> 00:35:02.090
<v Speaker 1>I think he needs an edge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's just a little too soft.</v>

793
00:35:02.210 --> 00:35:04.670
<v Speaker 1>Like God's got his hair blown out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't,</v>

794
00:35:04.671 --> 00:35:09.500
<v Speaker 1>if I had to do a makeover,</v>
<v Speaker 1>less scarves,</v>

795
00:35:09.890 --> 00:35:11.630
<v Speaker 1>less flowing shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

796
00:35:11.631 --> 00:35:12.920
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he needs an edge man.</v>

797
00:35:13.070 --> 00:35:14.030
<v Speaker 1>Poor God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at him.</v>

798
00:35:15.110 --> 00:35:18.140
<v Speaker 1>He's wearing those visors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this old lady tennis visors.</v>

799
00:35:18.740 --> 00:35:21.200
<v Speaker 1>If you're not a hunter s Thompson and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't say that Vegas on them.</v>

800
00:35:21.890 --> 00:35:24.620
<v Speaker 1>Take that fucking thing off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the picture of absolute bliss</v>

801
00:35:24.621 --> 00:35:25.910
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he wants to do it.</v>

802
00:35:25.911 --> 00:35:28.070
<v Speaker 1>That's what he wants to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well listen,</v>

803
00:35:28.220 --> 00:35:31.310
<v Speaker 1>he's been with those crazy bitches for</v>
<v Speaker 1>so long.</v>

804
00:35:31.311 --> 00:35:33.530
<v Speaker 1>He became one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

805
00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:35.330
<v Speaker 1>that's really what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a little more,</v>

806
00:35:35.510 --> 00:35:36.920
<v Speaker 1>I think they tricked him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe.</v>

807
00:35:36.921 --> 00:35:38.070
<v Speaker 1>I think they could put you in that</v>

808
00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:39.510
<v Speaker 2>house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't think you're coming out</v>

809
00:35:39.511 --> 00:35:42.420
<v Speaker 2>looking like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I probably would imagine if,</v>

810
00:35:42.421 --> 00:35:46.950
<v Speaker 2>I did imagine if it was proven that if</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're around women like that many women</v>

811
00:35:46.951 --> 00:35:49.320
<v Speaker 2>long enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they slowly but surely Ab your</v>

812
00:35:49.321 --> 00:35:51.600
<v Speaker 2>masculinity away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you want to become a woman?</v>

813
00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:53.080
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

814
00:35:53.080 --> 00:35:56.860
<v Speaker 2>If it's proven that like we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we imitate our atmosphere so much that</v>

815
00:35:56.861 --> 00:36:00.750
<v Speaker 2>one more around the opposite sex for two</v>
<v Speaker 2>months or one of those people that view</v>

816
00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:03.520
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's that psychological word?</v>

817
00:36:03.521 --> 00:36:04.810
<v Speaker 2>They say that you're a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

818
00:36:04.811 --> 00:36:08.800
<v Speaker 2>you're codependent and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to watch out who you hang out</v>

819
00:36:08.801 --> 00:36:10.060
<v Speaker 2>with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're pretty soon you're doing what</v>

820
00:36:10.061 --> 00:36:14.020
<v Speaker 2>they're doing and next thing you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know there are people like you want</v>

821
00:36:14.021 --> 00:36:16.480

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

825
00:36:24.401 --> 00:36:27.020
<v Speaker 2>because people aren't going to notice</v>
<v Speaker 2>that</v>

826
00:36:29.010 --> 00:36:31.360
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

<v Speaker 2>just going like this.</v>

<v Speaker 2>he was a part of it.</v>

866
00:38:05.990 --> 00:38:06.541
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No they,</v>

867
00:38:06.541 --> 00:38:08.660
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they take being cleaned to a whole</v>

868
00:38:08.661 --> 00:38:11.510
<v Speaker 2>nother level and is generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of 'em think white people are</v>

869
00:38:11.511 --> 00:38:15.920
<v Speaker 2>pretty filthy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was a trend in MMA fighters for the</v>

870
00:38:15.921 --> 00:38:17.840
<v Speaker 2>longest time was getting their nails</v>
<v Speaker 2>done.</v>

871
00:38:17.841 --> 00:38:20.840
<v Speaker 2>Like chocolate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dell started out [inaudible] is funny,</v>

872
00:38:20.841 --> 00:38:23.480
<v Speaker 2>man colored pink and I thought it was to</v>
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>

873
00:38:23.481 --> 00:38:25.960
<v Speaker 2>that's fucking funny cause you can kick</v>
<v Speaker 2>the shit out of somebody.</v>

874
00:38:26.290 --> 00:38:26.760
<v Speaker 2>That's that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

875
00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:29.510
<v Speaker 2>Way that Bruce Lee story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's stuff that he used to walk around</v>

876
00:38:29.511 --> 00:38:32.790
<v Speaker 2>wherever the fuck he was from even go</v>
<v Speaker 2>into the city and he would act all the</v>

877
00:38:32.791 --> 00:38:36.010
<v Speaker 2>feminine so people would fuck with them</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then he'd beat the shit</v>

878
00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:38.440
<v Speaker 1>out of him and his friend would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why did you do that?</v>

879
00:38:38.530 --> 00:38:40.510
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if I just kicked his ass,</v>

880
00:38:40.511 --> 00:38:43.690
<v Speaker 1>he could get over it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if some of feminine guy kicked his</v>

881
00:38:43.691 --> 00:38:44.980
<v Speaker 1>ass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's going to stay with them.</v>

882
00:38:45.710 --> 00:38:47.550
<v Speaker 1>And I want that to be true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can give you the,</v>

883
00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:50.800
<v Speaker 1>the whatever the book is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Bruce Lee book is a,</v>

884
00:38:50.801 --> 00:38:52.810
<v Speaker 1>it has a red cover.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can never remember the name of it and</v>

885
00:38:52.811 --> 00:38:56.290
<v Speaker 1>a black and white photo and he's like</v>
<v Speaker 1>this and just fucking shredded.</v>

886
00:38:57.010 --> 00:38:59.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was across to all the other Bruce Lee</v>

887
00:38:59.081 --> 00:39:00.790
<v Speaker 1>photos where he's like 20 pounds</v>
<v Speaker 1>overweight.</v>

888
00:39:01.150 --> 00:39:03.380
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would think that he would probably be</v>

889
00:39:03.381 --> 00:39:07.240
<v Speaker 1>a guy who would come up with a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 1>different real life scenarios just to</v>

890
00:39:07.241 --> 00:39:09.610
<v Speaker 1>test as martial arts and to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

891
00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:11.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>becoming a feminine guy and have guys</v>

892
00:39:11.441 --> 00:39:12.280
<v Speaker 1>try to beat your ass.</v>

893
00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:14.860
<v Speaker 1>It seems like a good move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty bad ass.</v>

894
00:39:14.861 --> 00:39:18.190
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a smart move because most</v>
<v Speaker 1>people spend their lives right here.</v>

895
00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:20.650
<v Speaker 1>Avoiding physical confrontations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

896
00:39:20.651 --> 00:39:21.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know once,</v>

897
00:39:21.761 --> 00:39:24.700
<v Speaker 1>once people really started gaining</v>
<v Speaker 1>weight and fucking bloody noses and</v>

898
00:39:24.701 --> 00:39:25.810
<v Speaker 1>broke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>busted eye sockets,</v>

899
00:39:25.811 --> 00:39:26.940
<v Speaker 1>I tapped out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just like,</v>

900
00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:29.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to tell some jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you,</v>

901
00:39:30.010 --> 00:39:33.580
<v Speaker 1>the only way to really test it is to</v>
<v Speaker 1>test in a real life situation.</v>

902
00:39:33.610 --> 00:39:36.880
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people that look really</v>
<v Speaker 1>good in the gym and then when it comes</v>

903
00:39:36.881 --> 00:39:39.730
<v Speaker 1>to an actual fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just fall apart and panic.</v>

904
00:39:40.060 --> 00:39:42.280
<v Speaker 1>They just can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think that you need that.</v>

905
00:39:42.281 --> 00:39:43.810
<v Speaker 1>You got to have a couple of days that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

906
00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:45.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for some drinks,</v>

907
00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:45.790
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gotta,</v>

908
00:39:45.790 --> 00:39:47.950
<v Speaker 1>you gotta have a couple of fights and</v>
<v Speaker 1>hopefully survive them.</v>

909
00:39:48.580 --> 00:39:50.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't have a fight,</v>

910
00:39:50.590 --> 00:39:52.450
<v Speaker 1>and if you ever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you ever seen someone get in a fight</v>

911
00:39:52.451 --> 00:39:54.760
<v Speaker 1>that's never been in a fight before and</v>
<v Speaker 1>go into a full panic?</v>

912
00:39:56.320 --> 00:39:58.330
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I've told this story before,</v>

913
00:39:58.331 --> 00:40:01.120
<v Speaker 1>but it was at the comedy store.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're sitting on the patio and there was</v>

914
00:40:01.121 --> 00:40:03.730
<v Speaker 1>this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this black guy in a white guy,</v>

915
00:40:03.731 --> 00:40:07.300
<v Speaker 1>they were fighting in front of the House</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Blues and the yelling at each other</v>

916
00:40:07.570 --> 00:40:10.900

<v Speaker 1>physical,</v>

<v Speaker 1>the white guy is in full on fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>panic mode.</v>

918

<v Speaker 1>His eyes are closed and he's literally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was this me flailing this way?</v>

919
00:40:21.310 --> 00:40:24.220

<v Speaker 1>like not moving his shoulders,</v>

920
00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:27.880
<v Speaker 1>but his arms are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he's boxing the guy's ears.</v>

921

<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

1017
00:44:31.030 --> 00:44:33.000
<v Speaker 2>all those childhood memories of where I</v>
<v Speaker 2>was when I,</v>

1018
00:44:33.001 --> 00:44:35.370
<v Speaker 2>when I was going on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like I,</v>

1019
00:44:35.371 --> 00:44:36.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like the Cosby thing.</v>

1020
00:44:36.511 --> 00:44:37.410
<v Speaker 2>He just hope it isn't true.</v>

<v Speaker 3>obviously.</v>

1027
00:44:50.441 --> 00:44:55.441
<v Speaker 3>But the thing about Zeppelin that got me</v>
<v Speaker 3>was that every band is influenced by</v>

1028
00:44:55.481 --> 00:44:57.340
<v Speaker 3>every other band,</v>

<v Speaker 3>it's sound like guys because that was</v>
<v Speaker 3>their music and I think as a lot of us</v>

1032
00:45:05.951 --> 00:45:10.780
<v Speaker 3>has calming influence influenced,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no one ever got sued for my point though</v>

1033
00:45:10.781 --> 00:45:12.400
<v Speaker 3>is my point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My point was,</v>

1034
00:45:12.820 --> 00:45:17.820
<v Speaker 3>but there's a certain line that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>cross that they crossed where they were</v>

1035
00:45:17.921 --> 00:45:21.100
<v Speaker 3>stealing rifts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The opening to stairway to heaven.</v>

1036
00:45:21.101 --> 00:45:24.820
<v Speaker 3>It's like my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a silage they'll allege it seems</v>

1037
00:45:24.821 --> 00:45:29.570
<v Speaker 3>like the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Legit allegedly allegedly delivery.</v>

1038
00:45:29.830 --> 00:45:33.190
<v Speaker 3>But it made me less,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it made me like them less.</v>

1039
00:45:33.220 --> 00:45:37.840
<v Speaker 3>I know the music is still amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it made me like the less that was a,</v>

1040
00:45:37.841 --> 00:45:38.800
<v Speaker 3>that was devastating.</v>

1041
00:45:39.110 --> 00:45:40.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they're still,</v>

1042
00:45:40.781 --> 00:45:43.530
<v Speaker 2>but I have a bootleg of this and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>have them at like</v>

1043
00:45:45.230 --> 00:45:49.310
<v Speaker 2>the whiskey or something and they have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>song called killing floor that sounds</v>

1044
00:45:49.311 --> 00:45:53.540
<v Speaker 2>like the lemon song.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then by the time it's out on led</v>

1045
00:45:53.541 --> 00:45:55.250
<v Speaker 2>Zeppelin to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's called lemon song.</v>

1046
00:45:55.730 --> 00:45:59.750
<v Speaker 2>And then later they got sued for that by</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy who wrote killing floor.</v>

1047
00:46:00.080 --> 00:46:01.580
<v Speaker 2>So they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not like they didn't know.</v>

1048
00:46:01.850 --> 00:46:03.170
<v Speaker 2>That's one of those things where it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like,</v>

1049
00:46:03.171 --> 00:46:05.050
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you obviously knew that you were calling</v>

1050
00:46:05.070 --> 00:46:09.470
<v Speaker 2>a killing floor is a cover and then you</v>
<v Speaker 2>switched some of the lyrics and then</v>

1051
00:46:09.471 --> 00:46:11.440
<v Speaker 2>called it the lemon song.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's fun.</v>

1052
00:46:11.720 --> 00:46:13.190
<v Speaker 2>But I don't know if this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to me,</v>

1053
00:46:13.191 --> 00:46:16.670
<v Speaker 2>this is just me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is completely uneducated looking at this</v>

1054
00:46:16.671 --> 00:46:17.810
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just know that,</v>

1055
00:46:17.811 --> 00:46:18.650
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1056
00:46:18.950 --> 00:46:20.870
<v Speaker 2>that just is a little suspect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But just,</v>

1057
00:46:20.900 --> 00:46:22.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously I'm not a musician,</v>

1058
00:46:22.101 --> 00:46:22.980
<v Speaker 2>so I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1059
00:46:23.030 --> 00:46:23.720
<v Speaker 2>Fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dunno.</v>

1060
00:46:23.720 --> 00:46:24.650
<v Speaker 2>I don't want it to be true.</v>

1061
00:46:24.780 --> 00:46:27.310
<v Speaker 3>I don't want it to be true either.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's the same thing as the Cosby</v>

1062
00:46:27.311 --> 00:46:28.230
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody wants,</v>

1063
00:46:28.231 --> 00:46:28.890
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those,</v>

1064
00:46:28.890 --> 00:46:31.200
<v Speaker 3>I was reading this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Chris Rock Article's really interesting,</v>

1065
00:46:31.201 --> 00:46:33.540
<v Speaker 3>Chris rock article where he's talking</v>
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>

1066
00:46:33.541 --> 00:46:35.390
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people being offended by everything.</v>

1067
00:46:35.391 --> 00:46:37.710
<v Speaker 3>And that's why he doesn't do colleges</v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore cause it just looking to be</v>

1068
00:46:37.711 --> 00:46:39.900
<v Speaker 3>offended at things and they're just too</v>
<v Speaker 3>easy to offend.</v>

1069
00:46:40.260 --> 00:46:42.600
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was saying that he just doesn't want</v>

1070
00:46:42.601 --> 00:46:45.360
<v Speaker 3>it to be true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think everybody feels like that</v>

1071
00:46:45.361 --> 00:46:47.460
<v Speaker 3>except the people that obviously were</v>
<v Speaker 3>raped by him.</v>

1072
00:46:47.940 --> 00:46:49.200
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would want it not to be true</v>

1073
00:46:49.201 --> 00:46:50.420
<v Speaker 2>because then they wouldn't be raped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1074
00:46:50.550 --> 00:46:51.031
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1075
00:46:51.031 --> 00:46:52.470
<v Speaker 2>So like all of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1076
00:46:52.471 --> 00:46:53.880
<v Speaker 2>you don't want that to happen to</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody.</v>

1077
00:46:53.881 --> 00:46:56.940
<v Speaker 2>And then also this person that you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you hold as a comedian,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1090
00:47:18.961 --> 00:47:20.460

<v Speaker 2>me talking about guy,</v>

1091
00:47:20.461 --> 00:47:22.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>77 years,</v>

1092
00:47:22.531 --> 00:47:24.000
<v Speaker 2>76,</v>
<v Speaker 2>77 years old,</v>

1093
00:47:24.001 --> 00:47:26.790
<v Speaker 2>was excited about his new special and</v>
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>

1094
00:47:26.791 --> 00:47:28.260
<v Speaker 2>why am I tell you I shot this Dang.</v>

1095
00:47:28.260 --> 00:47:32.680
<v Speaker 2>And then she was animated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so fucking excited about his new special</v>

1096
00:47:32.681 --> 00:47:36.610
<v Speaker 2>and was just like to see a guy that far</v>
<v Speaker 2>into it still that excited about</v>

1097
00:47:36.611 --> 00:47:37.211
<v Speaker 2>standup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1098
00:47:37.211 --> 00:47:39.430
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that gave me a charge for like</v>

1099
00:47:39.430 --> 00:47:41.290
<v Speaker 2>weeks and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1100
00:47:41.291 --> 00:47:42.550
<v Speaker 2>so like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope it's not true.</v>

1101
00:47:43.270 --> 00:47:45.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really hope it's not true for the</v>

1102
00:47:45.071 --> 00:47:47.800
<v Speaker 2>victims more so than it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're just focusing on him though.</v>

1103
00:47:47.890 --> 00:47:50.890
<v Speaker 2>But if you're doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then the victims are crazy lunches,</v>

1104
00:47:50.950 --> 00:47:51.840
<v Speaker 2>alleged victim.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1105
00:47:51.841 --> 00:47:52.674
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you know,</v>

1106
00:47:53.260 --> 00:47:57.610
<v Speaker 2>that's better to be a crazy person to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>a crazy liar than to be a rape victim.</v>

1107
00:47:58.010 --> 00:48:00.420
<v Speaker 2>They were to being raped by bill Cosby.</v>

1108
00:48:00.650 --> 00:48:04.880
<v Speaker 5>This new one is interesting because the</v>
<v Speaker 5>girl said it says she was 15 and he,</v>

1109
00:48:05.350 --> 00:48:08.450
<v Speaker 5>he took her to the playboy mansion and</v>
<v Speaker 5>allegedly,</v>

1110
00:48:08.451 --> 00:48:12.440
<v Speaker 5>but when you go to the playboy mansion,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they have your name on records.</v>

1111
00:48:12.441 --> 00:48:16.520
<v Speaker 5>Like every person that goes there has to</v>
<v Speaker 5>put their name down in all their</v>

1112
00:48:16.521 --> 00:48:17.460
<v Speaker 5>information down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

1113
00:48:17.480 --> 00:48:21.140
<v Speaker 5>there might be actual proof that she was</v>
<v Speaker 5>15 and he took her to the playboy</v>

1114
00:48:21.141 --> 00:48:21.940
<v Speaker 5>mansion</v>

1115
00:48:21.940 --> 00:48:23.800
<v Speaker 2>sound like one of those bad news</v>
<v Speaker 2>programs.</v>

1116
00:48:23.980 --> 00:48:27.210
<v Speaker 2>So there might be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we might have some information later on</v>

1117
00:48:27.440 --> 00:48:30.180
<v Speaker 2>so hang around for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like not the little in the point</v>

1118
00:48:30.190 --> 00:48:31.540
<v Speaker 2>where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's just his fucking brutal.</v>

1119
00:48:32.170 --> 00:48:32.920
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy though.</v>

1120
00:48:32.920 --> 00:48:36.790
<v Speaker 3>This all happened out of Hannibal</v>
<v Speaker 3>Burress his joke like him talking about</v>

1121
00:48:36.791 --> 00:48:37.510
<v Speaker 3>it on stage.</v>

1122
00:48:37.510 --> 00:48:39.090
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody filming the person who put it</v>

1123
00:48:39.091 --> 00:48:41.730
<v Speaker 2>up should be getting credit cause Ha</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hannibal didn't do that and he shouldn't</v>

1124
00:48:41.731 --> 00:48:44.340
<v Speaker 2>be getting the grief either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a fucking great joke is a funny</v>

1125
00:48:44.341 --> 00:48:45.840
<v Speaker 2>joke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a joke.</v>

1126
00:48:46.670 --> 00:48:50.380
<v Speaker 2>Then it became funny bit possible fact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1127
00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:52.440
<v Speaker 2>I actually felt bad for him because I</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't think he wanted that.</v>

1128
00:48:52.441 --> 00:48:54.300
<v Speaker 2>I think he just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was just telling a joke.</v>

1129
00:48:54.690 --> 00:48:56.130
<v Speaker 2>They do it if some of this shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1130
00:48:56.580 --> 00:48:58.210
<v Speaker 2>that's all of that shit is taken out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>car,</v>

1131
00:48:58.230 --> 00:49:01.050
<v Speaker 2>like re everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like these fucking people who take your</v>

1132
00:49:01.051 --> 00:49:03.660
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They do the same thing that a news,</v>

1133
00:49:04.410 --> 00:49:08.820
<v Speaker 2>like a um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bias news channel or like a political</v>

1134
00:49:08.821 --> 00:49:12.660
<v Speaker 2>ad we'll do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I did this rant making fun of cubs</v>

1135
00:49:12.661 --> 00:49:16.080
<v Speaker 2>fans versus White Sox fans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the reason why I did it was because</v>

1136
00:49:16.081 --> 00:49:19.890
<v Speaker 2>recently Chicago had beaten the Boston</v>
<v Speaker 2>team and all I wanted to do was cause</v>

1137
00:49:19.891 --> 00:49:20.724
<v Speaker 2>infighting.</v>

1138
00:49:21.210 --> 00:49:22.830
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't believe a fucking word of it.</v>

1139
00:49:22.860 --> 00:49:24.630
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I went on this whole thing and then</v>

1140
00:49:24.631 --> 00:49:27.360
<v Speaker 2>I paused and in the end I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just fucking with you guys.</v>

1141
00:49:27.361 --> 00:49:31.170
<v Speaker 2>I'm just mad because blah blah blah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They lopped that part off and now it's</v>

1142
00:49:31.171 --> 00:49:36.171
<v Speaker 2>just a standalone piece that I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>shitting all over cubs fans and I'm</v>

1143
00:49:36.391 --> 00:49:39.030
<v Speaker 2>defending white sox fans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then what was funny was I took a</v>

1144
00:49:39.031 --> 00:49:40.510
<v Speaker 2>wild guess and I actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are like,</v>

1145
00:49:40.511 --> 00:49:42.240
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is like fucking dead on.</v>

1146
00:49:42.390 --> 00:49:45.300
<v Speaker 2>This is exactly the way it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like I didn't know that but,</v>

1147
00:49:45.301 --> 00:49:48.060
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the point of it is is that they went up</v>

1148
00:49:48.061 --> 00:49:51.540
<v Speaker 2>there and they deliberately lopped off</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing where I say it's just a joke.</v>

1149
00:49:53.880 --> 00:49:57.320
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there's that and I got a specialist</v>

1150
00:49:57.330 --> 00:50:02.330
<v Speaker 2>Friday man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we really tried to fucking be interested</v>

1151
00:50:02.941 --> 00:50:04.650
<v Speaker 2>in that dumb story for the whole time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just,</v>

1152
00:50:04.651 --> 00:50:08.910
<v Speaker 2>all you had now we just went</v>
<v Speaker 2>to story bill.</v>

1153
00:50:09.240 --> 00:50:10.470
<v Speaker 2>I don't know where to go with that man.</v>

1154
00:50:10.610 --> 00:50:12.650
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm thinking about this culture of</v>

1155
00:50:12.651 --> 00:50:15.340
<v Speaker 3>trying to catch people doing things like</v>
<v Speaker 3>that and I,</v>

1156
00:50:15.410 --> 00:50:16.670
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and get upset at them,</v>

1157
00:50:16.940 --> 00:50:21.050
<v Speaker 3>especially when it's clearly a joke and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a whole bit and in my act about</v>

1158
00:50:21.051 --> 00:50:24.160
<v Speaker 3>the difference between jokes that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>say on stage and like being in court and</v>

1159
00:50:24.180 --> 00:50:28.130
<v Speaker 3>getting fucking affidavit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a whole bit in my last</v>

1160
00:50:28.130 --> 00:50:29.480
<v Speaker 2>special about lying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1161
00:50:29.481 --> 00:50:32.450
<v Speaker 2>I lie on stage all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you watch any of my act and you</v>

1162
00:50:32.451 --> 00:50:33.170
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

1163
00:50:33.170 --> 00:50:34.670
<v Speaker 2>I'm the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't see things the way this guy,</v>

1164
00:50:34.671 --> 00:50:36.380
<v Speaker 2>I don't either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't see these things in the way.</v>

1165
00:50:36.381 --> 00:50:38.120
<v Speaker 2>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about that around.</v>

1166
00:50:38.210 --> 00:50:40.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll say shit that I don't believe in.</v>

1167
00:50:40.131 --> 00:50:43.640
<v Speaker 2>If it's funny and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think part of what Chris Rock was</v>

1168
00:50:43.641 --> 00:50:45.560
<v Speaker 2>saying is that people are getting</v>
<v Speaker 2>offended.</v>

1169
00:50:46.630 --> 00:50:51.140
<v Speaker 2>Comics comics should apologize and less,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they actually meant it in a malicious</v>

1170
00:50:51.141 --> 00:50:52.610
<v Speaker 2>way that the person took it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you,</v>

1171
00:50:52.611 --> 00:50:54.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he can go on stage in a bad mood and you</v>

1172
00:50:54.171 --> 00:50:58.220
<v Speaker 2>can deliberately get an,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone can heckle you or do something</v>

1173
00:50:58.221 --> 00:51:00.710
<v Speaker 2>and then you get mad and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>deliberately try to fucking piss him off</v>

1174
00:51:01.340 --> 00:51:03.710
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1175
00:51:03.711 --> 00:51:07.430
<v Speaker 2>you might owe somebody an apology then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you don't have to go on TV and</v>

1176
00:51:07.431 --> 00:51:08.990
<v Speaker 2>fucking apologize to the country.</v>

1177
00:51:09.320 --> 00:51:10.850
<v Speaker 2>People are doing it because they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>scared.</v>

1178
00:51:10.851 --> 00:51:13.970
<v Speaker 2>They don't want to lose the careers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then they also,</v>

1179
00:51:14.180 --> 00:51:17.290
<v Speaker 2>the people have demanded an apology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You would have</v>

1180
00:51:19.480 --> 00:51:22.550
<v Speaker 2>in kind of say whatever you want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not true.</v>

1181
00:51:23.150 --> 00:51:24.200
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a career,</v>

1182
00:51:24.230 --> 00:51:26.600
<v Speaker 2>so talking shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand that.</v>

1183
00:51:26.750 --> 00:51:28.220
<v Speaker 2>But the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as of yet,</v>

1184
00:51:28.221 --> 00:51:30.920
<v Speaker 2>I do not have a TV show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why don't you have to teach better off</v>

1185
00:51:30.921 --> 00:51:33.280
<v Speaker 2>without it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's when better off without the fuck</v>

1186
00:51:33.290 --> 00:51:36.260
<v Speaker 2>you doing to this animated show that I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing comes out to you.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you wait,</v>

1188
00:51:37.520 --> 00:51:39.230
<v Speaker 2>but you're doing great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stand up though.</v>

00:51:41.580 --> 00:51:44.690

<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying,</v>

1191
00:51:44.691 --> 00:51:49.580
<v Speaker 2>but the animated thing was the perfect</v>
<v Speaker 2>way to go into the TV because you can</v>

1192
00:51:49.581 --> 00:51:50.450
<v Speaker 2>get away with anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

00:51:50.451 --> 00:51:52.490
<v Speaker 2>Cause you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to offend anybody with</v>

1194
00:51:52.491 --> 00:51:54.190
<v Speaker 2>these animated people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what,</v>

1195
00:51:54.290 --> 00:51:57.890

<v Speaker 2>animated children?</v>

1196
00:51:59.360 --> 00:52:01.580
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about all the three fingered</v>

<v Speaker 2>Simpsons,</v>

1204
00:52:19.580 --> 00:52:22.730
<v Speaker 2>you're always,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you ever saying anything on stage</v>

1205
00:52:22.731 --> 00:52:24.980
<v Speaker 2>that's controversial,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're always going to open yourself up</v>

1206
00:52:24.981 --> 00:52:27.680
<v Speaker 2>to opportunistic people that just want</v>
<v Speaker 2>click bait.</v>

1207
00:52:27.740 --> 00:52:30.500
<v Speaker 2>There's no such thing as controversy in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in standup comedy.</v>

1208
00:52:30.620 --> 00:52:31.820
<v Speaker 2>There's no such thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

1209
00:52:31.850 --> 00:52:36.510
<v Speaker 2>It is manufactured controversy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all complete horseshit.</v>

1210
00:52:36.710 --> 00:52:38.990
<v Speaker 2>It's one person in the crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The amount of times that they've showed</v>

1211
00:52:38.991 --> 00:52:41.450
<v Speaker 2>clips of comics who said something</v>
<v Speaker 2>controversial.</v>

1212
00:52:41.720 --> 00:52:44.930
<v Speaker 2>You literally hear the crowd laughing on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fucking tape.</v>

1213
00:52:45.200 --> 00:52:46.070
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's laughing.</v>

1214
00:52:46.130 --> 00:52:49.370
<v Speaker 2>Taking it as a joke and one fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>person and then you know,</v>

1215
00:52:49.610 --> 00:52:51.110
<v Speaker 2>and then you just take it out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>context,</v>

1216
00:52:51.111 --> 00:52:53.750
<v Speaker 2>which is out of the comedy club.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1217
00:52:53.751 --> 00:52:56.120
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to think of a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Any of my jokes that I could do on the</v>

1218
00:52:56.121 --> 00:52:58.700
<v Speaker 2>news that wouldn't seem like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1219
00:52:58.701 --> 00:53:01.670
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing this bit about Isis and how</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not a threat and I'd like to see</v>

1220
00:53:01.671 --> 00:53:05.000
<v Speaker 2>him try to invade Florida where</v>
<v Speaker 2>silencers are legal and see how far they</v>

1221
00:53:05.001 --> 00:53:07.730

00:53:07.731 --> 00:53:10.490
<v Speaker 2>And a comedy club.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You then put that on Fox News.</v>

1223

<v Speaker 2>Well what about the soldiers died?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We return the controversial tape we'll</v>

1225
00:53:22.731 --> 00:53:26.340
<v Speaker 2>be playing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about the soldiers that died?</v>

1226
00:53:26.710 --> 00:53:31.530
<v Speaker 2>We are here from Florida that actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>confronted Isis.</v>

1227
00:53:31.531 --> 00:53:34.320
<v Speaker 2>When we return,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he listens to what bill said.</v>

1228
00:53:34.350 --> 00:53:36.510
<v Speaker 2>And then after that show and Nancy</v>
<v Speaker 2>Grace,</v>

1229
00:53:36.511 --> 00:53:39.210
<v Speaker 2>we'll pick it up on the next hour.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bill Baer,</v>

1230
00:53:39.450 --> 00:53:44.450
<v Speaker 2>the standup Comedienne.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might have seen him on such shows as</v>

1231
00:53:44.760 --> 00:53:48.600
<v Speaker 2>breaking bad bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go out on a limb and say</v>

1232
00:53:48.601 --> 00:53:50.310
<v Speaker 2>she's a hot shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you went out and drag with the,</v>

1233
00:53:50.370 --> 00:53:51.820
<v Speaker 2>do you think so?</v>
<v Speaker 2>She would just laugh Vic.</v>

1234
00:53:51.821 --> 00:53:52.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a fucking shell.</v>

1235
00:53:53.150 --> 00:53:54.330
<v Speaker 2>Do you think she's just being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1236
00:53:54.331 --> 00:53:56.130
<v Speaker 2>she was a print.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much do you know how much my face</v>

1237
00:53:56.131 --> 00:53:58.320
<v Speaker 2>hurts to pretend to be that mad?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every episode.</v>

1238
00:53:59.670 --> 00:54:02.040
<v Speaker 2>I love coming out here and smoking a</v>
<v Speaker 2>little weed and fucking get in a</v>

1239
00:54:02.041 --> 00:54:03.120
<v Speaker 2>relaxed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My eyebrows.</v>

1241
00:54:05.260 --> 00:54:08.190

<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1242
00:54:08.191 --> 00:54:10.020
<v Speaker 2>I think she would be fun as hell to hang</v>
<v Speaker 2>out with.</v>

1243
00:54:10.060 --> 00:54:13.260
<v Speaker 2>Andy actually get into an argument with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just a,</v>

1244
00:54:13.290 --> 00:54:18.290
<v Speaker 2>she makes unfortunate faces on TV.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think she's probably exactly like she</v>

1245
00:54:18.961 --> 00:54:21.120
<v Speaker 2>comes off on TV.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet that's her.</v>

1246
00:54:21.930 --> 00:54:22.870
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nah.</v>

1247
00:54:23.310 --> 00:54:24.810
<v Speaker 2>You can tell you right now.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I would buy the inland empire.</v>

1251
00:54:35.550 --> 00:54:37.350
<v Speaker 2>She would loosen up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He thinks,</v>

00:54:57.030 --> 00:54:59.760
<v Speaker 2>What's the worst guests you ever had</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you just wanted to reach through</v>

1259
00:54:59.761 --> 00:55:02.230
<v Speaker 2>the screen and punched him in the face</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then she'd be telling a funny story</v>

1260
00:55:02.231 --> 00:55:03.064
<v Speaker 2>and then maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and</v>

1261
00:55:04.750 --> 00:55:05.950
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'd be in,</v>

1262
00:55:06.370 --> 00:55:08.760
<v Speaker 2>you'd ask her about the Duke Duke</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lacrosse case,</v>

1263
00:55:08.910 --> 00:55:12.270
<v Speaker 2>whether it was she was unfairly accusing</v>
<v Speaker 2>them of something they didn't do.</v>

1264
00:55:12.540 --> 00:55:14.460
<v Speaker 2>I don't watch it on TV.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't watch the show,</v>

1265
00:55:14.461 --> 00:55:16.200
<v Speaker 2>but we are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's funny about her as she looks like</v>

1266
00:55:16.201 --> 00:55:20.640
<v Speaker 2>Ozzy Osborne in like 1985 during the</v>
<v Speaker 2>ultimate center.</v>

1267
00:55:20.880 --> 00:55:23.640
<v Speaker 2>Like when she wears the black eyeliner</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes I literally</v>

1268
00:55:25.520 --> 00:55:27.000
<v Speaker 2>a better looking Ozzie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course.</v>

1269
00:55:27.360 --> 00:55:28.830
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm more dainty.</v>

1270
00:55:29.170 --> 00:55:30.510
<v Speaker 2>Ozzie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Less Feminine.</v>

1271
00:55:30.540 --> 00:55:32.970
<v Speaker 2>More Bruce Jenner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ask less hard road.</v>

1272
00:55:33.210 --> 00:55:34.043
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1273
00:55:35.640 --> 00:55:40.640
<v Speaker 2>America in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The youth of today to day.</v>

1274
00:55:41.871 --> 00:55:42.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1275
00:55:42.660 --> 00:55:44.810
<v Speaker 2>I saw something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why this reminded me of,</v>

1276
00:55:45.160 --> 00:55:46.890
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think shaving down your Adam's apple</v>

1277
00:55:46.920 --> 00:55:47.611
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking of,</v>

1278
00:55:47.611 --> 00:55:49.350
<v Speaker 2>I actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1279
00:55:49.380 --> 00:55:51.290
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometime I started talking about torture</v>

1280
00:55:51.291 --> 00:55:53.280
<v Speaker 2>or some shit on my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of my podcasts and someone was</v>

1281
00:55:53.281 --> 00:55:54.360
<v Speaker 2>showing them the devices,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1282
00:55:54.361 --> 00:55:56.180
<v Speaker 2>the rack,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the rack would,</v>

1283
00:55:56.181 --> 00:55:56.971
<v Speaker 2>they would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they put him on,</v>

1284
00:55:56.971 --> 00:55:58.620
<v Speaker 2>they tie your legs and they would crank</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1285
00:55:58.650 --> 00:56:00.330
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And these guys did an experiment.</v>

1286
00:56:00.331 --> 00:56:04.200
<v Speaker 2>Was what gave way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was that your tendons or whatever?</v>

1287
00:56:04.201 --> 00:56:06.180
<v Speaker 2>You know what it was?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They actually discovered it was the</v>

1288
00:56:06.181 --> 00:56:08.100
<v Speaker 2>bone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh God.</v>

1289
00:56:08.640 --> 00:56:11.580
<v Speaker 2>Fucking broke or pulled away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They they put like,</v>

1290
00:56:12.150 --> 00:56:14.160
<v Speaker 2>it was the creepiest thing ever where</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were just like,</v>

1291
00:56:14.161 --> 00:56:17.460
<v Speaker 2>this is a pig's ankle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the closest to a human's ankle.</v>

1292
00:56:17.700 --> 00:56:19.050
<v Speaker 2>At which point you're sitting in home</v>
<v Speaker 2>gone.</v>

1293
00:56:19.530 --> 00:56:21.840
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if they said it was a Yak,</v>

1294
00:56:21.841 --> 00:56:23.800
<v Speaker 2>like I would argue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea.</v>

1295
00:56:24.100 --> 00:56:26.260
<v Speaker 2>So they put this thing on there and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>start,</v>

1296
00:56:26.630 --> 00:56:30.040
<v Speaker 2>they tied this little hook with part of</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's neat St.</v>

1297
00:56:30.041 --> 00:56:32.620
<v Speaker 2>It was just as much like the knee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to see this thing and they start</v>

1298
00:56:32.621 --> 00:56:37.000
<v Speaker 2>cranking this thing and you're hearing</v>
<v Speaker 2>it every time it gave way.</v>

1299
00:56:37.001 --> 00:56:39.970
<v Speaker 2>You're heard a noise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would do an x ray and you know</v>

1300
00:56:39.971 --> 00:56:42.430
<v Speaker 2>these fucking scientists are so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh this is interesting.</v>

1301
00:56:42.460 --> 00:56:45.190
<v Speaker 2>This is interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The patella is still there and the</v>

1302
00:56:45.640 --> 00:56:46.950
<v Speaker 2>issue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see the middle car,</v>

1303
00:56:46.960 --> 00:56:48.760
<v Speaker 2>we'll fucking whatever the hell</v>
<v Speaker 2>ligament,</v>

1304
00:56:49.840 --> 00:56:52.330
<v Speaker 2>but what we're seeing is we're seeing is</v>
<v Speaker 2>stress in Nashville Femur,</v>

1305
00:56:52.360 --> 00:56:54.730
<v Speaker 2>which would be a femur and they fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>kept doing it.</v>

1306
00:56:54.731 --> 00:56:57.640
<v Speaker 2>And what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What gave way it was,</v>

1307
00:56:57.641 --> 00:57:02.590
<v Speaker 2>I guess I was the slowness of it that</v>
<v Speaker 2>made the bone break and not the fucking</v>

1308
00:57:02.591 --> 00:57:04.930
<v Speaker 2>tendons where if you just get hit quick</v>
<v Speaker 2>or something like that.</v>

1309
00:57:04.930 --> 00:57:05.980
<v Speaker 2>The tenants I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1310
00:57:05.981 --> 00:57:07.780
<v Speaker 2>I'm so fucking stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember what they came</v>

1311
00:57:07.781 --> 00:57:10.180
<v Speaker 2>conclusion with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it actually broke your fucking</v>

1312
00:57:10.181 --> 00:57:14.080
<v Speaker 2>bounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing what inventions people came</v>

1313
00:57:14.081 --> 00:57:18.610
<v Speaker 2>up with just to fuck you up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more like to make you more in pain while</v>

1314
00:57:18.611 --> 00:57:22.030
<v Speaker 2>there were killing you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The two things that I've ever seen,</v>

1315
00:57:22.540 --> 00:57:24.340
<v Speaker 2>there's very few actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe cats,</v>

1316
00:57:25.060 --> 00:57:28.320
<v Speaker 2>monkeys and human beings are the most</v>
<v Speaker 2>cats.</v>

1317
00:57:28.350 --> 00:57:33.350
<v Speaker 2>A mold breaking my bones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most sadistic like cats,</v>

1318
00:57:34.331 --> 00:57:36.940
<v Speaker 2>the way they catch a mouse and then fuck</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking let the thing get away and then</v>

1319
00:57:36.970 --> 00:57:38.860
<v Speaker 2>get it again and give it hope and take</v>
<v Speaker 2>it away.</v>

1320
00:57:38.950 --> 00:57:41.260
<v Speaker 2>But you'd get the death penalty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like somebody begging for their</v>

1321
00:57:41.261 --> 00:57:42.041
<v Speaker 2>fucking life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1322
00:57:42.041 --> 00:57:44.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw this video one time,</v>

1323
00:57:44.291 --> 00:57:46.300
<v Speaker 2>this chimpanzee like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>basic.</v>

1324
00:57:46.301 --> 00:57:49.780
<v Speaker 2>In the last 10 12 years they've</v>
<v Speaker 2>discovered that chimpanzees like the</v>

1325
00:57:49.781 --> 00:57:53.320
<v Speaker 2>occasional steak and want to eat another</v>
<v Speaker 2>monkey because they thought that they</v>

1326
00:57:53.321 --> 00:57:54.160
<v Speaker 2>were vegetarians.</v>

1327
00:57:54.160 --> 00:57:56.500
<v Speaker 2>So this fucking monkey trap,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this small,</v>

1328
00:57:56.501 --> 00:57:58.480
<v Speaker 2>it's chimpanzee trapped this smaller</v>
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>

1329
00:57:58.750 --> 00:58:01.720
<v Speaker 2>and he's basically standing on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking thing up in a tree.</v>

1330
00:58:02.020 --> 00:58:04.450
<v Speaker 2>And rather than just snapping,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fucking neck.</v>

1331
00:58:04.720 --> 00:58:09.370
<v Speaker 2>It's taking its finger and his thumb and</v>
<v Speaker 2>just digging flesh out of its fucking</v>

1332
00:58:09.371 --> 00:58:14.260
<v Speaker 2>back and eating it as the monkey is</v>
<v Speaker 2>underneath that just screaming bloody</v>

1333
00:58:14.261 --> 00:58:15.880
<v Speaker 2>fucking murder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you just sit and I,</v>

1334
00:58:15.881 --> 00:58:17.380
<v Speaker 2>I've dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I fired a gun.</v>

1335
00:58:17.590 --> 00:58:19.840
<v Speaker 2>I would have blown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That thing's fucking brains out.</v>

1336
00:58:20.110 --> 00:58:22.500
<v Speaker 2>Just start a principle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen that.</v>

1337
00:58:22.620 --> 00:58:25.330
<v Speaker 2>I've seen that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen that video.</v>

1338
00:58:25.630 --> 00:58:27.610
<v Speaker 2>I've seen a bunch of those videos with</v>
<v Speaker 2>chimps.</v>

1339
00:58:27.790 --> 00:58:31.120
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they liked to eat king hate chimpanzees</v>

1340
00:58:31.121 --> 00:58:34.720
<v Speaker 2>should the scary animals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are definitely should be respected,</v>

1341
00:58:35.020 --> 00:58:37.720
<v Speaker 2>but they like to eat the organs first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They eat them while they're alive.</v>

1342
00:58:37.780 --> 00:58:40.240
<v Speaker 2>It's grabbed the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>apparently the Oregons the most</v>

1343
00:58:40.241 --> 00:58:41.350
<v Speaker 2>delicious part to them.</v>

1344
00:58:41.710 --> 00:58:43.180
<v Speaker 2>So while they're holding onto the</v>
<v Speaker 2>monkeys,</v>

1345
00:58:43.181 --> 00:58:45.400
<v Speaker 2>they're not trying to kill them first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're just trying to go right to the</v>

1346
00:58:45.401 --> 00:58:49.450
<v Speaker 2>guts and started eating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Dude,</v>

1347
00:58:49.451 --> 00:58:52.150
<v Speaker 2>it's just bending.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But getting back to you get back to the</v>

1348
00:58:52.151 --> 00:58:53.320
<v Speaker 2>rack,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like how could you,</v>

1349
00:58:53.480 --> 00:58:57.280
<v Speaker 2>the fucking agony you're putting</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody through.</v>

1350
00:58:57.281 --> 00:58:58.840
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't do that to somebody.</v>

1351
00:58:58.900 --> 00:59:01.810
<v Speaker 2>Don't you think it was?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was during the time where first of</v>

1352
00:59:01.811 --> 00:59:04.840
<v Speaker 2>all people died like way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>way quicker.</v>

1353
00:59:04.900 --> 00:59:07.130
<v Speaker 2>Like people didn't live very long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They live to be alert.</v>

1354
00:59:07.160 --> 00:59:09.650
<v Speaker 2>If you're lucky,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got 50 years in holy Shit.</v>

1355
00:59:09.651 --> 00:59:13.150
<v Speaker 2>Like I lived to be 50 whilst the infant</v>
<v Speaker 2>mortality rate was really high.</v>

1356
00:59:13.270 --> 00:59:15.880
<v Speaker 2>There were constantly at war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>war was at close range.</v>

1357
00:59:16.060 --> 00:59:20.600
<v Speaker 2>So war involved like swords and arrows</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he thinks about shots.</v>

1358
00:59:20.610 --> 00:59:24.380
<v Speaker 2>The kind of fuck catalog does fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>flaming bodies.</v>

1359
00:59:24.440 --> 00:59:26.840
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they used to literally light bodies on</v>

1360
00:59:26.841 --> 00:59:31.841
<v Speaker 2>fire because human fat is like a good</v>
<v Speaker 2>way of a lighting building's on fire</v>

1361
00:59:32.360 --> 00:59:34.850
<v Speaker 2>because it's so disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when they would light us on fire,</v>

1362
00:59:34.851 --> 00:59:38.250
<v Speaker 2>they like human bodies on fire launch</v>
<v Speaker 2>them and catapults roofs.</v>

1363
00:59:38.400 --> 00:59:39.650
<v Speaker 2>Hilum first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1364
00:59:39.680 --> 00:59:41.480
<v Speaker 2>probably.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe,</v>

1365
00:59:41.570 --> 00:59:43.210
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whatever they wanted to do.</v>

1366
00:59:43.230 --> 00:59:45.380
<v Speaker 2>I can't Greenway to a tech center</v>
<v Speaker 2>lecture people.</v>

1367
00:59:49.600 --> 00:59:51.350
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when people get to that night you were</v>

1368
00:59:51.351 --> 00:59:51.891
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where are they?</v>

1369
00:59:51.891 --> 00:59:55.370
<v Speaker 2>Just going to use all the fucking fuel</v>
<v Speaker 2>to figure out a way to just have no</v>

1370
00:59:55.371 --> 00:59:58.300
<v Speaker 2>waste.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We use the waste and it becomes feel,</v>

1371
00:59:58.490 --> 01:00:00.980
<v Speaker 2>but that kind of life where you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1372
01:00:00.981 --> 01:00:04.940
<v Speaker 2>your subject of violence and brutality</v>
<v Speaker 2>on a regular basis.</v>

1373
01:00:05.620 --> 01:00:07.910
<v Speaker 2>I bet they was that the movies where the</v>
<v Speaker 2>movies,</v>

1374
01:00:07.911 --> 01:00:09.860
<v Speaker 2>they only show the wars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't just show it when they're</v>

1375
01:00:09.861 --> 01:00:12.800
<v Speaker 2>hanging out playing like a flute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>

1376
01:00:12.801 --> 01:00:16.010
<v Speaker 2>I think there's probably a lot of war</v>
<v Speaker 2>going on pretty much all throughout</v>

1377
01:00:16.011 --> 01:00:18.740
<v Speaker 2>human history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just feel like you could hide so much</v>

1378
01:00:18.741 --> 01:00:20.720
<v Speaker 2>easier back in the woods.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1379
01:00:20.721 --> 01:00:23.180
<v Speaker 2>He just ran into the woods.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1380
01:00:23.181 --> 01:00:24.180
<v Speaker 2>That was the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here I'm calming.</v>

1381
01:00:24.181 --> 01:00:27.380
<v Speaker 2>Ps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you hear the floor fucking moving on the</v>

1382
01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:30.170
<v Speaker 2>horses back there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to figure out a way to get away</v>

1383
01:00:30.171 --> 01:00:31.010
<v Speaker 2>from the wolves.</v>

1384
01:00:31.250 --> 01:00:33.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you want going down to whole foods.</v>

1385
01:00:33.081 --> 01:00:34.160
<v Speaker 2>You a hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your own food.</v>

1386
01:00:34.161 --> 01:00:35.570
<v Speaker 2>You were self sufficient.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1387
01:00:35.571 --> 01:00:37.610
<v Speaker 2>But you had to have your bow and Arrow</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all that stuff.</v>

1388
01:00:37.611 --> 01:00:41.390
<v Speaker 2>You'd like to be close to town,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a fucking blacksmith nearby.</v>

1389
01:00:41.860 --> 01:00:43.550
<v Speaker 2>Like when you're out there in the woods</v>
<v Speaker 2>by herself,</v>

1390
01:00:43.551 --> 01:00:45.560
<v Speaker 2>it's probably pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty hard scrabble life.</v>

1391
01:00:46.910 --> 01:00:48.350
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know something.</v>

1392
01:00:48.740 --> 01:00:50.510
<v Speaker 2>Anything that's going to kill it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You kill it.</v>

1393
01:00:50.511 --> 01:00:52.910
<v Speaker 2>Kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking shoot at you and kill</v>

1394
01:00:52.911 --> 01:00:53.421
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kill it.</v>

01:00:53.421 --> 01:00:55.130
<v Speaker 2>You anything that's going to kill you</v>
<v Speaker 2>out there.</v>

1396
01:00:55.131 --> 01:00:57.650
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be a quick like a dude.</v>

1397
01:00:57.651 --> 01:00:59.690
<v Speaker 2>If a mountain line ever fucking ran at</v>
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>

1398
01:00:59.710 --> 01:01:02.840
<v Speaker 2>I'd fucking just give him a neck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get it over with.</v>

1399
01:01:02.841 --> 01:01:05.310
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've gotten scratched by a fucking house</v>

1400
01:01:05.311 --> 01:01:07.280
<v Speaker 2>cat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think I want to fucking fuck with</v>

1401

<v Speaker 2>140 pound cat and proportionate like</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're there.</v>

1403
01:01:14.630 --> 01:01:17.930
<v Speaker 2>As far as like the strongest house cats</v>
<v Speaker 2>or the strongest cats,</v>

1404
01:01:17.931 --> 01:01:20.920
<v Speaker 2>it's house cats are with some of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>strongest pound for pound and mountain</v>

1405
01:01:20.930 --> 01:01:24.680
<v Speaker 2>lines like right up there with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stronger even than like some other cats</v>

1406
01:01:24.681 --> 01:01:27.620
<v Speaker 2>that are terrifying to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How they fight off bears going into my</v>

1407
01:01:27.621 --> 01:01:30.720
<v Speaker 2>youtube video watching.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They definitely do.</v>

1408
01:01:30.721 --> 01:01:33.260
<v Speaker 2>It was doing all the animals shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now is it an animal plant?</v>

1409
01:01:33.261 --> 01:01:36.950
<v Speaker 2>Is that what discovery just went all</v>
<v Speaker 2>cars like they don't fucking do anything</v>

1410
01:01:36.970 --> 01:01:38.330
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Discovery.</v>

1411
01:01:38.350 --> 01:01:40.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Animals anymore.</v>

1412
01:01:41.030 --> 01:01:44.060
<v Speaker 2>Well there's a lot of shows like TLC</v>
<v Speaker 2>used to be the learning channel.</v>

1413
01:01:44.420 --> 01:01:45.620
<v Speaker 2>What do they do now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Reality.</v>

1414
01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:47.290
<v Speaker 2>That's all reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's I say history.</v>

1415
01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:51.230
<v Speaker 2>That's Tlc is honey booboo you don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>have with a history channel is they just</v>

1416
01:01:51.231 --> 01:01:53.920
<v Speaker 2>ran out of war footage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just raved.</v>

1417
01:01:53.930 --> 01:01:54.920
<v Speaker 2>Just got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we got nothing.</v>

1418
01:01:54.950 --> 01:01:58.310
<v Speaker 2>And then they had to show like nothing</v>
<v Speaker 2>is interesting to anybody anymore unless</v>

1419
01:01:58.330 --> 01:01:58.880
<v Speaker 2>there's footage.</v>

1420
01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:02.510
<v Speaker 2>Like I hate it when they would do like</v>
<v Speaker 2>even like some of the civil war shit,</v>

1421
01:02:02.511 --> 01:02:05.120
<v Speaker 2>they would have to reenact it because</v>
<v Speaker 2>before remember when we were kids they</v>

1422
01:02:05.121 --> 01:02:08.510
<v Speaker 2>would just have drawings of it and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>would sort of pan the camera across</v>

1423
01:02:08.511 --> 01:02:13.160
<v Speaker 2>summit and which would put you to sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then World War II was the shit cause</v>

1424
01:02:13.161 --> 01:02:15.440
<v Speaker 2>they would just show him planes getting</v>
<v Speaker 2>shot down and all of that.</v>

1425
01:02:15.441 --> 01:02:16.274
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like a movie.</v>

1426
01:02:16.470 --> 01:02:19.380
<v Speaker 2>Well they had history channel had like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of Nazi shows.</v>

1427
01:02:19.470 --> 01:02:22.230
<v Speaker 2>They had a bunch of those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I think after a while they just</v>

1428
01:02:22.231 --> 01:02:26.730
<v Speaker 2>realize is more money in idiots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is more money and just reality TV.</v>

1429
01:02:26.850 --> 01:02:29.100
<v Speaker 2>It's just safe to a certain point in</v>
<v Speaker 2>time that you come in network.</v>

1430
01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:30.810
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean what I think happened was a bunch</v>

1431
01:02:30.811 --> 01:02:34.020
<v Speaker 2>of people will watch your reality and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Martin watching their shows and the rise</v>

1432
01:02:34.021 --> 01:02:35.310
<v Speaker 2>at the third hour,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1433
01:02:35.340 --> 01:02:37.890
<v Speaker 2>What happened in the night of the long</v>
<v Speaker 2>knives or whatever the fuck.</v>

1434
01:02:37.891 --> 01:02:40.320
<v Speaker 2>Then just no one cared anymore and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're just like,</v>

1435
01:02:40.321 --> 01:02:42.330
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that's what you want,</v>

1436
01:02:42.570 --> 01:02:45.680
<v Speaker 2>they have shit on like ancient aliens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they have a,</v>

1437
01:02:45.730 --> 01:02:48.450
<v Speaker 2>I mean they have how many episodes of</v>
<v Speaker 2>ancient aliens have they done?</v>

1438
01:02:48.910 --> 01:02:53.160
<v Speaker 2>I totally believe in aliens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think anybody has figured</v>

1439
01:02:53.161 --> 01:02:56.610
<v Speaker 2>out a way to travel from planet to</v>
<v Speaker 2>planet and actually live.</v>

1440
01:02:57.570 --> 01:03:01.450
<v Speaker 2>I think it's possible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think that way too invested in it</v>

1441
01:03:01.451 --> 01:03:04.560
<v Speaker 2>being originally we could figure it out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we're going to destroy each other</v>

1442
01:03:04.561 --> 01:03:07.980
<v Speaker 2>first and I think everything kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you destroy yourselves.</v>

1443
01:03:08.460 --> 01:03:11.460
<v Speaker 2>That's gods.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think fucking checks and balances.</v>

1444
01:03:12.030 --> 01:03:15.330
<v Speaker 2>I made this thing smart enough to figure</v>
<v Speaker 2>out how to get over to this other pot of</v>

1445
01:03:15.331 --> 01:03:18.720
<v Speaker 2>people that I made,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they got jealousy and envy and I</v>

1446
01:03:18.721 --> 01:03:22.800
<v Speaker 2>want credit and I want to produce your</v>
<v Speaker 2>credit on your fucking rocket ship and</v>

1447
01:03:22.801 --> 01:03:27.450
<v Speaker 2>all that shit and like they're all going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to destroy each other first.</v>

1448
01:03:28.220 --> 01:03:31.860
<v Speaker 2>Like we'll destroy it before we figure</v>
<v Speaker 2>even know how to get to fucking Mars on</v>

1449
01:03:31.861 --> 01:03:32.970
<v Speaker 2>it by a spell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where are you going to do,</v>

1450
01:03:33.180 --> 01:03:33.781
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you,</v>

1451
01:03:33.781 --> 01:03:35.650
<v Speaker 2>how do you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you have enough air to get their</v>

1452
01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:38.220
<v Speaker 2>air?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like in the oxygen?</v>

1453
01:03:38.790 --> 01:03:41.220
<v Speaker 2>Something that generates oxygen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd have to have something to</v>

1454
01:03:41.221 --> 01:03:43.740
<v Speaker 2>processes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Carbon dioxide generates oxygen.</v>

1455
01:03:44.100 --> 01:03:46.200
<v Speaker 2>There's a harder thing would be you</v>
<v Speaker 2>could,</v>

1456
01:03:46.230 --> 01:03:49.530
<v Speaker 2>you could probably do that a last,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I guess the question is,</v>

1457
01:03:49.740 --> 01:03:50.610
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>plants do that,</v>

1458
01:03:50.611 --> 01:03:51.720
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that what plants too?</v>

1459
01:03:52.260 --> 01:03:55.470
<v Speaker 2>But that's going to last all the way to</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mars.</v>

1460
01:03:56.250 --> 01:03:59.090
<v Speaker 2>Six months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's got to last six months and I</v>

1461
01:03:59.091 --> 01:04:00.660
<v Speaker 2>remember,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it takes six months to get</v>

1462
01:04:00.661 --> 01:04:02.040
<v Speaker 2>to Mars things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lots of sand.</v>

1463
01:04:02.280 --> 01:04:03.690
<v Speaker 2>I think they're saying it takes six</v>
<v Speaker 2>months.</v>

1464
01:04:04.830 --> 01:04:05.663
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't.</v>

1465
01:04:08.030 --> 01:04:11.010
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>think about how far the moon is the</v>

1466
01:04:11.010 --> 01:04:12.280
<v Speaker 2>moon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just seven days,</v>

1467
01:04:12.330 --> 01:04:13.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all this shit.</v>

1468
01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:14.810
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it takes six months to get the marks.</v>

1469
01:04:15.630 --> 01:04:18.030
<v Speaker 2>How long do you think it will take?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking years?</v>

1470
01:04:18.270 --> 01:04:19.530
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure it's six months.</v>

1471
01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:21.030
<v Speaker 2>Let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1472
01:04:21.210 --> 01:04:24.030
<v Speaker 2>how many months to get to Mars?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got a creepy tone right now.</v>

1473
01:04:24.090 --> 01:04:25.830
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure it's six months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could be wrong</v>

1474
01:04:27.900 --> 01:04:29.640
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was very self deprecating.</v>

1475
01:04:30.060 --> 01:04:32.470
<v Speaker 2>It's possible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1476
01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:33.870
<v Speaker 2>precise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Six to eight months.</v>

1477
01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:39.180
<v Speaker 2>I think as far as an earth orbits are</v>
<v Speaker 2>perfectly circular.</v>

1478
01:04:39.270 --> 01:04:42.330
<v Speaker 2>But that's like just a drone though to</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually get a personal note for this is</v>

1479
01:04:42.331 --> 01:04:43.230
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a person,</v>

1480
01:04:43.710 --> 01:04:46.560
<v Speaker 2>this is for a person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're talking about the a man space</v>

1481
01:04:46.561 --> 01:04:49.860
<v Speaker 2>travel to Mars mission where they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually going to have to stay there,</v>

1482
01:04:49.861 --> 01:04:51.960
<v Speaker 2>which is really fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These people are gonna.</v>

1483
01:04:52.350 --> 01:04:53.490
<v Speaker 2>It's gonna take,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1484
01:04:53.550 --> 01:04:57.360
<v Speaker 2>about six months to get there to do you</v>

1487
01:05:05.941 --> 01:05:10.470
<v Speaker 2>gravitational pull,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is stopping you from missing Mars</v>

<v Speaker 2>Talk to relations.</v>

1489
01:05:13.110 --> 01:05:15.420
<v Speaker 2>I know that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm saying if those things are off.</v>

1490
01:05:15.810 --> 01:05:16.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they never are though.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Saturn.</v>

1494
01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:30.070
<v Speaker 2>Jupiter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're pretty good at figuring out</v>

1495
01:05:30.670 --> 01:05:31.503
<v Speaker 2>earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mars,</v>

1496
01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:33.040
<v Speaker 2>Jupiter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Saturn,</v>

1497
01:05:34.480 --> 01:05:37.510
<v Speaker 2>Neptune,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uranus,</v>

1498
01:05:37.810 --> 01:05:41.230
<v Speaker 2>Pluto loop completed anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're bringing it back though,</v>

1499
01:05:41.231 --> 01:05:42.130
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1500
01:05:42.550 --> 01:05:44.650
<v Speaker 2>Where'd you hear that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I heard recently that they were</v>

1501
01:05:44.830 --> 01:05:46.930
<v Speaker 2>considering bringing it back as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>planet.</v>

1502
01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:49.690
<v Speaker 2>Did you hear that or read that on a</v>
<v Speaker 2>website?</v>

1503
01:05:49.750 --> 01:05:52.480
<v Speaker 2>This is how they should promote that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They should have like when they bring</v>

1504
01:05:52.481 --> 01:05:54.370
<v Speaker 2>Pluto back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they should have the scientists dressed</v>

1505
01:05:54.371 --> 01:05:56.030
<v Speaker 2>in like bell bottoms and shit with like</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

<v Speaker 2>assumption.</v>

1508
01:06:00.700 --> 01:06:02.560
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bringing it back.</v>

1509
01:06:03.130 --> 01:06:04.330
<v Speaker 2>Bringing it back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come on man.</v>

1510
01:06:04.930 --> 01:06:09.220
<v Speaker 2>I was dressed up like saludo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1511
01:06:09.221 --> 01:06:11.170
<v Speaker 2>that's too on the fucking note too on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the nose.</v>

1512
01:06:11.310 --> 01:06:12.150
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I hate?</v>

1513
01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:16.510
<v Speaker 2>You know what I hate in a on a joke</v>
<v Speaker 2>writer room is they got a hat on a hat,</v>

1514
01:06:17.160 --> 01:06:19.990
<v Speaker 2>a hat on a hat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you have like a joke within a joke,</v>

1515
01:06:20.040 --> 01:06:22.150
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's like say say whatever the joke</v>

1516
01:06:22.151 --> 01:06:25.720
<v Speaker 2>is you fall off the fucking chair and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you want to add another layer to</v>

1517
01:06:25.721 --> 01:06:26.260
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They go that's,</v>

1518
01:06:26.260 --> 01:06:30.280
<v Speaker 2>that's a hat on a hat and it's just like</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what if it's still but they don't</v>

1519
01:06:30.281 --> 01:06:32.980
<v Speaker 2>understand like taglines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it's still funny.</v>

1520
01:06:33.380 --> 01:06:36.280
<v Speaker 2>It's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Still is funny but if it's not funny</v>

1521
01:06:36.281 --> 01:06:37.220
<v Speaker 2>it's not funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1522
01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:39.940
<v Speaker 2>It's like if you had a half that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How come I can't look at the other</v>

1523
01:06:39.941 --> 01:06:42.250
<v Speaker 2>fucking hat the next time I watch it</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause I didn't even notice it.</v>

1524
01:06:42.790 --> 01:06:44.830
<v Speaker 2>If you have a hat on a hat and the hat</v>
<v Speaker 2>is funny,</v>

1525
01:06:44.860 --> 01:06:46.450
<v Speaker 2>it's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I think.</v>

1526
01:06:46.510 --> 01:06:49.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think like they're acting like funny</v>

1527
01:06:49.031 --> 01:06:52.720
<v Speaker 2>plus funny equals not funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that does that.</v>

1528
01:06:52.750 --> 01:06:55.120
<v Speaker 2>How does that work?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's just a lack of,</v>

1529
01:06:55.690 --> 01:06:59.080
<v Speaker 2>it's just the different mentality that a</v>
<v Speaker 2>comic has versus,</v>

1530
01:06:59.260 --> 01:07:02.180
<v Speaker 2>there's definitely like a place you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>go where it's not funny anymore or we've</v>

1531
01:07:02.190 --> 01:07:05.170
<v Speaker 2>had a too many jokes or you ruined the</v>
<v Speaker 2>original joke.</v>

1532
01:07:06.580 --> 01:07:10.900
<v Speaker 2>But I think a writers have a different</v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective and granted they write for a</v>

1533
01:07:10.901 --> 01:07:14.140
<v Speaker 2>living and I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think their perspective is a</v>

1534
01:07:14.141 --> 01:07:17.200
<v Speaker 2>scene as opposed to your perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is like stand up,</v>

1535
01:07:17.980 --> 01:07:19.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>looking at it standup wise.</v>

1536
01:07:19.940 --> 01:07:22.270
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not looking at it like this is going</v>

1537
01:07:22.271 --> 01:07:22.720
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1538
01:07:22.720 --> 01:07:27.580
<v Speaker 2>I just think it's fucking funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think as many layers as you can add to</v>

1539
01:07:27.581 --> 01:07:29.170
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just keeps getting funnier.</v>

1540
01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:31.600
<v Speaker 2>And then if people don't even get it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's fucking funny.</v>

1541
01:07:32.520 --> 01:07:36.670
<v Speaker 2>Like why would you even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why would you fucking sit there and make</v>

1542
01:07:36.671 --> 01:07:38.020
<v Speaker 2>that damn rural?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1543
01:07:38.021 --> 01:07:38.590
<v Speaker 2>I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1544
01:07:38.590 --> 01:07:41.500
<v Speaker 2>I'm going against all of these</v>
<v Speaker 2>successful shows,</v>

1545
01:07:41.530 --> 01:07:44.530
<v Speaker 2>so whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think there's a different style</v>

1546
01:07:44.531 --> 01:07:46.510
<v Speaker 2>of writing too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't you think there's a different</v>

1547
01:07:46.511 --> 01:07:49.240
<v Speaker 2>style to way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you write for standup and the way</v>

1548
01:07:49.241 --> 01:07:51.550
<v Speaker 2>you write or you would write for a</v>
<v Speaker 2>television show?</v>

1549
01:07:51.551 --> 01:07:53.440
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just a different kind of writing.</v>

1550
01:07:53.530 --> 01:07:55.780
<v Speaker 2>I barely know what I'm talking about</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever.</v>

1551
01:07:55.870 --> 01:07:56.810
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1552
01:07:56.890 --> 01:07:58.840
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe I'm just frustrated with pitching</v>

1553
01:07:58.841 --> 01:08:01.840
<v Speaker 2>jokes and then somebody's going to Ed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a hat on a hat.</v>

1554
01:08:02.660 --> 01:08:04.930
<v Speaker 2>Like a hat on hat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll see.</v>

1555
01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:08.170
<v Speaker 2>That's why I'm telling you a guy like</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1556
01:08:08.300 --> 01:08:12.370
<v Speaker 2>your best shit is you just being you</v>
<v Speaker 2>without anybody that you have to pitch</v>

1557
01:08:12.371 --> 01:08:13.204
<v Speaker 2>it to.</v>

1558
01:08:14.260 --> 01:08:17.840
<v Speaker 2>Cause you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a very year from now when I</v>

1559
01:08:17.841 --> 01:08:20.450
<v Speaker 2>show up with the six episodes of</v>
<v Speaker 2>emphasis for funny,</v>

1560
01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:22.880
<v Speaker 2>I think you're getting up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to have you heard talking</v>

1561
01:08:22.881 --> 01:08:25.460
<v Speaker 2>about a cartoon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm always 100% functioning too little.</v>

1562
01:08:25.461 --> 01:08:26.720
<v Speaker 2>My fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she love it.</v>

1563
01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:28.430
<v Speaker 2>Animated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever you call it.</v>

1564
01:08:28.431 --> 01:08:32.330
<v Speaker 2>It's</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you look at like the most</v>

1565
01:08:32.360 --> 01:08:35.570
<v Speaker 2>innovative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dangerous comedy on TV ever,</v>

1566
01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:38.840
<v Speaker 2>it's out park because they can get away</v>
<v Speaker 2>with those guys.</v>

1567
01:08:38.960 --> 01:08:42.620
<v Speaker 2>They've done the best social commentary</v>
<v Speaker 2>for like 17 years.</v>

1568
01:08:42.621 --> 01:08:44.240
<v Speaker 2>They don't get the credit they deserve.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1569
01:08:44.241 --> 01:08:46.040
<v Speaker 2>Not even close.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're animals.</v>

1570
01:08:46.340 --> 01:08:47.930
<v Speaker 2>They're the best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're and they're,</v>

1571
01:08:47.931 --> 01:08:50.960
<v Speaker 2>they're so innovative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're just constantly coming up with</v>

1572
01:08:50.961 --> 01:08:54.980
<v Speaker 2>new shit like every week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Genius is that for their social</v>

1573
01:08:54.981 --> 01:08:59.180
<v Speaker 2>commentaries because how simplistic the</v>
<v Speaker 2>animation is that those guys that are</v>

1574
01:08:59.181 --> 01:09:02.060
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they can just churn them out but</v>

1575
01:09:02.061 --> 01:09:06.170
<v Speaker 2>like how finished and polished it is.</v>

1576
01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:09.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As a brand new joke coming right out of</v>

1577
01:09:09.230 --> 01:09:10.880
<v Speaker 2>the gate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first time they era where they just,</v>

1578
01:09:10.910 --> 01:09:15.190
<v Speaker 2>they just fucking nail it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's different.</v>

1579
01:09:15.290 --> 01:09:17.420
<v Speaker 2>For whatever reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like they're going to have to do</v>

1580
01:09:17.421 --> 01:09:21.080
<v Speaker 2>it for 30 years and then tell people</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they're leaving before they're</v>

1581
01:09:21.081 --> 01:09:24.800
<v Speaker 2>finally going to just acknowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1582
01:09:24.801 --> 01:09:28.100
<v Speaker 2>they're going to get out the fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mark Twain Award and all that stupid</v>

1583
01:09:28.101 --> 01:09:29.510
<v Speaker 2>shit that you supposed to get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1584
01:09:29.511 --> 01:09:31.880
<v Speaker 2>they get acknowledgement just by</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody in loving them.</v>

1585
01:09:31.940 --> 01:09:36.560
<v Speaker 2>I mean the show is that they have taught</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty much total autonomy over comedy</v>

1586
01:09:36.561 --> 01:09:38.060
<v Speaker 2>central.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They kind of get away with whatever they</v>

1587
01:09:38.061 --> 01:09:39.620
<v Speaker 2>want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they can,</v>

1588
01:09:39.950 --> 01:09:43.040
<v Speaker 2>they can pull off shit on their show</v>
<v Speaker 2>that no one could ever pull off on</v>

1589
01:09:43.041 --> 01:09:44.780
<v Speaker 2>another show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just don't think people give him enough</v>

1590
01:09:44.781 --> 01:09:45.614
<v Speaker 2>credit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1591
01:09:45.620 --> 01:09:46.880
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to change that argument</v>
<v Speaker 2>show.</v>

1592
01:09:46.910 --> 01:09:48.560
<v Speaker 2>I'm with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they give him enough</v>

1593
01:09:48.561 --> 01:09:52.280
<v Speaker 2>credit either,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but either way it's big.</v>

1594
01:09:52.340 --> 01:09:55.790
<v Speaker 2>They can do so much because it's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>cartoon and the characters never get</v>

1595
01:09:55.791 --> 01:09:57.470
<v Speaker 2>old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't have to worry about their</v>

<v Speaker 2>no idea is no nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was really,</v>

1651
01:12:03.951 --> 01:12:06.260
<v Speaker 2>I just took a general like we like you</v>

<v Speaker 2>walked out I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1656
01:12:12.561 --> 01:12:14.900
<v Speaker 2>I kind of got this idea for a cartoon</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they wanted to do,</v>

1657
01:12:14.901 --> 01:12:19.901
<v Speaker 2>when they wait a minute and sit down and</v>
<v Speaker 2>three fucking years later we are one</v>

1658
01:12:20.121 --> 01:12:21.950
<v Speaker 2>year away from it coming out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1659
01:12:21.951 --> 01:12:24.950
<v Speaker 2>it just works slowly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>slowly.</v>

1660
01:12:24.951 --> 01:12:25.640
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the it,</v>

1661
01:12:25.640 --> 01:12:27.440
<v Speaker 2>what is the heart?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody was,</v>

1662
01:12:27.441 --> 01:12:29.450
<v Speaker 2>didn't want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody wanted the idea and everything</v>

1663
01:12:29.451 --> 01:12:30.830
<v Speaker 2>and the whole thing was dead in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>water.</v>

1664
01:12:30.831 --> 01:12:33.290
<v Speaker 2>And then Vince was the guy who was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's go over to Netflix.</v>

1665
01:12:34.040 --> 01:12:37.610
<v Speaker 2>And even that guy's an ammo man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's in there in the fucking pitch</v>

<v Speaker 2>selling this fucking thing.</v>

1667
01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:43.940
<v Speaker 2>And then Netflix was like ridiculously</v>
<v Speaker 2>supportive.</v>

1668
01:12:43.941 --> 01:12:44.511
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

1676
01:13:04.141 --> 01:13:08.280
<v Speaker 3>like they're becoming like a real</v>
<v Speaker 3>legitimate network right before our</v>

1677
01:13:08.281 --> 01:13:08.660
<v Speaker 3>eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There'll</v>

1678
01:13:08.660 --> 01:13:13.660
<v Speaker 2>be on that because they're international</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they are so ahead of the game that</v>

1679
01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:19.320
<v Speaker 2>all you're going to see is just people</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to rip off their business model</v>

1680
01:13:19.410 --> 01:13:21.120
<v Speaker 2>is what's going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1681
01:13:21.900 --> 01:13:23.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the usual thing.</v>

1682
01:13:23.160 --> 01:13:24.510
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are these guys don't know.</v>

1683
01:13:24.511 --> 01:13:25.590
<v Speaker 2>They're not going to fucking blah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>

1684
01:13:25.591 --> 01:13:26.251
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all of a sudden,</v>

1685
01:13:26.251 --> 01:13:26.881
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right.</v>

1686
01:13:26.881 --> 01:13:27.640
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then,</v>

1687
01:13:27.640 --> 01:13:30.510
<v Speaker 2>then the next thing you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you become the person and then</v>

1688
01:13:30.511 --> 01:13:31.380
<v Speaker 2>everybody's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1689
01:13:31.381 --> 01:13:34.380
<v Speaker 2>that's the way you do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Monkey see monkey do.</v>

1690
01:13:34.381 --> 01:13:37.860
<v Speaker 2>And then I just think people will try to</v>
<v Speaker 2>rip off what they're going to do.</v>

1691
01:13:37.861 --> 01:13:40.170
<v Speaker 2>But they there at the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1692
01:13:40.740 --> 01:13:41.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were on point,</v>

1693
01:13:41.930 --> 01:13:44.610
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they're cutting their way through the</v>

1694
01:13:44.611 --> 01:13:45.990
<v Speaker 2>jungle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there's still going to be out in</v>

1695
01:13:45.991 --> 01:13:48.180
<v Speaker 2>front of everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think it's going to be very hard</v>

1696
01:13:48.810 --> 01:13:51.210
<v Speaker 2>for a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

1697
01:13:51.211 --> 01:13:53.250
<v Speaker 2>maybe the fourth person who tries to rip</v>
<v Speaker 2>it off.</v>

1698
01:13:53.250 --> 01:13:55.980
<v Speaker 2>There might be room for two other people</v>
<v Speaker 2>to try to rip off what they're doing.</v>

1699
01:13:56.700 --> 01:13:58.110
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you have like three,</v>

1700
01:13:58.111 --> 01:13:59.160
<v Speaker 2>like ABC,</v>
<v Speaker 2>NBC,</v>

1701
01:13:59.161 --> 01:14:02.730
<v Speaker 2>CBS of International Television.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1702
01:14:02.731 --> 01:14:05.280
<v Speaker 2>what they're doing that's unique is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're taking the money and they're</v>

1703
01:14:05.281 --> 01:14:08.880
<v Speaker 2>making their own shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the big thing there.</v>

1704
01:14:08.890 --> 01:14:11.290
<v Speaker 2>There've been doing it for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did my comedy special with them in</v>

1705
01:14:11.291 --> 01:14:15.610
<v Speaker 2>2005 that was originally on Netflix and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it got sold to showtime,</v>

1706
01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:19.840
<v Speaker 2>but they were even back then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's nine fucking years ago.</v>

1707
01:14:19.841 --> 01:14:23.530
<v Speaker 2>They were taking chances and funding</v>
<v Speaker 2>comedy specials and now they're doing</v>

1708
01:14:23.710 --> 01:14:26.940
<v Speaker 2>real originals that Kevin Spacey show</v>
<v Speaker 2>that um,</v>

1709
01:14:27.280 --> 01:14:29.620
<v Speaker 2>how's the cards,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know they're doing and the horsemen,</v>

<v Speaker 2>she's in that stage to where she has</v>

1732
01:15:26.501 --> 01:15:31.390
<v Speaker 2>like this giant amount of fans that</v>
<v Speaker 2>could just follow her anywhere she goes</v>

1733
01:15:32.080 --> 01:15:34.310
<v Speaker 2>and I don't know how that works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't get like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>And do stand up in the constantly.</v>

1737
01:15:40.580 --> 01:15:43.570
<v Speaker 2>I mean she does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She does a lot of shit.</v>

1738
01:15:43.630 --> 01:15:46.660
<v Speaker 2>She's just constantly working.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1739
01:15:46.661 --> 01:15:49.330
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm never going to be that busy.</v>

1740
01:15:50.280 --> 01:15:51.730
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't handle that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1741
01:15:51.731 --> 01:15:55.780
<v Speaker 2>I'm too busy right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a certain level of busy</v>

1742
01:15:55.781 --> 01:15:57.790
<v Speaker 2>where you just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can coast,</v>

1743
01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.430
<v Speaker 2>you could like keep it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>keep the fire burning at a certain</v>

1744
01:16:00.431 --> 01:16:02.560
<v Speaker 2>temperature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>certain Rpms,</v>

1745
01:16:02.680 --> 01:16:04.270
<v Speaker 2>but it goes up and down when it goes.</v>

1746
01:16:04.280 --> 01:16:07.690
<v Speaker 2>I would think just having a TV show and</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to keep that thing on the rails</v>

1747
01:16:07.691 --> 01:16:10.930
<v Speaker 2>and have just prevent someone from</v>
<v Speaker 2>coming in and fucking it up.</v>

1748
01:16:11.650 --> 01:16:13.320
<v Speaker 2>Would be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1749
01:16:14.200 --> 01:16:16.270
<v Speaker 2>would be hard enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a big thing.</v>

1750
01:16:16.271 --> 01:16:18.700
<v Speaker 2>Preventing someone from coming in and</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking it up.</v>

1751
01:16:18.910 --> 01:16:20.140
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause that's a real issue.</v>

1752
01:16:20.830 --> 01:16:22.630
<v Speaker 2>Someone could definitely come in and</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck it up.</v>

1753
01:16:22.690 --> 01:16:23.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause they want credit.</v>

1754
01:16:23.790 --> 01:16:24.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got it.</v>

1755
01:16:24.360 --> 01:16:26.350

<v Speaker 2>you have to implement something that I</v>

1756
01:16:26.351 --> 01:16:28.360
<v Speaker 2>said again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's all negative shit.</v>

1757
01:16:28.361 --> 01:16:32.560
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to try to white whitewash all</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1758
01:16:32.900 --> 01:16:34.660
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not that it hasn't happened to me,</v>

1759
01:16:34.661 --> 01:16:35.800
<v Speaker 2>but I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to get a test.</v>

1760
01:16:35.990 --> 01:16:37.860
<v Speaker 2>It's our old fucking conversation that</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1762
01:16:39.601 --> 01:16:41.620
<v Speaker 2>that's what it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that happens in every fucking business.</v>

1763
01:16:41.950 --> 01:16:43.000
<v Speaker 2>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at the Geek squad.</v>

<v Speaker 2>And then best buy,</v>

1765
01:16:44.321 --> 01:16:46.250
<v Speaker 2>it was like,</v>

1766
01:16:46.251 --> 01:16:48.830

<v Speaker 2>nobody uses this shit anymore.</v>

1767
01:16:48.870 --> 01:16:52.390

1903
01:22:48.120 --> 01:22:50.490

<v Speaker 2>The best was when he first got on</v>

1904
01:22:50.491 --> 01:22:52.710
<v Speaker 2>Twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you follow them early and nobody knew</v>

01:22:52.711 --> 01:22:55.260
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck he was doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you doing gang signs over there?</v>

01:22:55.380 --> 01:22:59.840
<v Speaker 2>I know I was doing three episodes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh it only when he had,</v>

1907
01:22:59.850 --> 01:23:03.120
<v Speaker 2>when he first got on Twitter and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so many people didn't know what he</v>

1908
01:23:03.121 --> 01:23:06.010
<v Speaker 2>was doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was fucking funny.</v>

1909
01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:08.800
<v Speaker 2>They still don't every day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he does still don't.</v>

1910
01:23:08.920 --> 01:23:11.260
<v Speaker 2>But he's like Zeplin such an underrated</v>
<v Speaker 2>band.</v>

1911
01:23:11.261 --> 01:23:13.620

01:23:18.460 --> 01:23:21.430

<v Speaker 2>like dumb high school kids.</v>

<v Speaker 2>that too.</v>

1916
01:23:25.631 --> 01:23:28.210

<v Speaker 2>missing something.</v>

01:24:25.391 --> 01:24:26.830
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like a,</v>

1937
01:24:26.831 --> 01:24:28.600
<v Speaker 2>it's a long,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the few times I ever wished that</v>

1938
01:24:28.601 --> 01:24:31.450
<v Speaker 2>I did like hallucinogens cause I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like,</v>

1939
01:24:31.451 --> 01:24:33.880
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was blowing my mind.</v>

1940
01:24:35.290 --> 01:24:37.070
<v Speaker 2>It blew my fucking mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had,</v>

1941
01:24:37.090 --> 01:24:41.470
<v Speaker 2>I think he had like Dyson or Eddie or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or somebody and it was just like,</v>

1942
01:24:42.040 --> 01:24:46.630
<v Speaker 2>I felt like I was like 24 again and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>was just starting out as a comic when I</v>

1943
01:24:46.631 --> 01:24:49.090
<v Speaker 2>used to watch it going by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I get to do standup on this,</v>

1944
01:24:49.091 --> 01:24:51.100
<v Speaker 2>how am I going to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how am I going to navigate?</v>

1945
01:24:51.101 --> 01:24:52.780
<v Speaker 2>Am I going to cross over to this crowd?</v>

1946
01:24:52.780 --> 01:24:55.040
<v Speaker 2>And</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1947
01:24:55.090 --> 01:24:57.460
<v Speaker 2>I dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just bizarre.</v>

1948
01:24:57.490 --> 01:25:02.380
<v Speaker 2>They took over his social media accounts</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they did that show like East</v>

1949
01:25:02.380 --> 01:25:02.891
<v Speaker 2>Arsenio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

1950
01:25:02.891 --> 01:25:04.180
<v Speaker 2>because he was being too edgy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1951
01:25:04.181 --> 01:25:05.200
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what they do.</v>

1952
01:25:05.350 --> 01:25:07.120
<v Speaker 2>That's what they do now on a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>shows.</v>

1953
01:25:07.150 --> 01:25:11.080
<v Speaker 2>They demand to take over your social</v>
<v Speaker 2>media and they start tweeting for you.</v>

1954
01:25:12.400 --> 01:25:14.410
<v Speaker 2>How crazy is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what he told me.</v>

1955
01:25:14.430 --> 01:25:18.340
<v Speaker 2>That signing over power of attorney and</v>
<v Speaker 2>like an uh,</v>

1956
01:25:18.920 --> 01:25:22.660
<v Speaker 2>exact cyberspace kind of way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly like signing their name,</v>

1957
01:25:22.690 --> 01:25:24.700
<v Speaker 2>your name,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he was trying to get his Facebook</v>

1958
01:25:24.701 --> 01:25:26.950
<v Speaker 2>back and it's Twitter back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

1959
01:25:26.951 --> 01:25:28.750
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was telling me,</v>

1960
01:25:28.751 --> 01:25:30.400
<v Speaker 2>he was telling me this at the ice house</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was like,</v>

1961
01:25:30.401 --> 01:25:31.820
<v Speaker 2>you gotta be fucking kidding me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They made,</v>

1962
01:25:32.050 --> 01:25:33.910
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to initially,</v>

1963
01:25:33.911 --> 01:25:34.631
<v Speaker 2>but I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

1964
01:25:34.631 --> 01:25:36.790
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be so busy with the show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck it.</v>

1965
01:25:36.791 --> 01:25:38.280
<v Speaker 2>Let 'em do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I'm trying to get it back.</v>

1966
01:25:38.281 --> 01:25:39.610
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

1967
01:25:39.970 --> 01:25:41.950
<v Speaker 2>they just take over your account.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1968
01:25:41.951 --> 01:25:43.300
<v Speaker 2>But if you let them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just say no.</v>

1969
01:25:43.330 --> 01:25:44.230
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1970
01:25:44.260 --> 01:25:47.830
<v Speaker 2>but you gotta be willing to say no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might be a deal breaker.</v>

1971
01:25:47.870 --> 01:25:49.930
<v Speaker 2>And he started Sineal go fuck yourself.</v>

1972
01:25:52.860 --> 01:25:54.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but came to me.</v>

1973
01:25:54.190 --> 01:25:54.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they,</v>

1974
01:25:54.850 --> 01:25:57.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they're thinking that people want to,</v>

1975
01:25:58.010 --> 01:26:01.900
<v Speaker 2>they want to be ball players,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1976
01:26:01.901 --> 01:26:02.651
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1977
01:26:02.651 --> 01:26:04.070
<v Speaker 2>we're willing to work with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like</v>

1978
01:26:04.070 --> 01:26:05.960
<v Speaker 1>want to make this show it hit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a Sioux thing.</v>

1979
01:26:06.320 --> 01:26:08.960
<v Speaker 1>They don't want to get sued by you</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying something fucking nuts.</v>

1980
01:26:09.320 --> 01:26:11.300
<v Speaker 1>And then Ima,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you read the guys' interviews,</v>

1981
01:26:11.330 --> 01:26:13.550
<v Speaker 1>aren't seeing it was interviews are</v>
<v Speaker 1>always great because he doesn't give a</v>

1982
01:26:13.551 --> 01:26:16.010
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he just Kinda says what he's saying.</v>

1983
01:26:16.011 --> 01:26:18.200
<v Speaker 1>So they're looking at like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

1984
01:26:18.410 --> 01:26:19.750
<v Speaker 1>Says Wild Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1985
01:26:19.770 --> 01:26:20.400
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1986
01:26:20.400 --> 01:26:21.710
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I just,</v>

1987
01:26:21.711 --> 01:26:25.550
<v Speaker 1>he's honest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which does not work when you got to sell</v>

1988
01:26:25.551 --> 01:26:28.880
<v Speaker 1>toothpaste and fucking cars and all that</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit in between the comedy.</v>

1989
01:26:28.881 --> 01:26:30.440
<v Speaker 1>So I think that that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's fine.</v>

1990
01:26:30.470 --> 01:26:32.160
<v Speaker 1>But having never gotten a show on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>air,</v>

1991
01:26:32.161 --> 01:26:35.360
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what I feel is going on behind</v>

1992
01:26:35.361 --> 01:26:36.460
<v Speaker 1>the scenes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll McGuire,</v>

1993
01:26:36.470 --> 01:26:38.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chris Mcguire was the head writer,</v>

1994
01:26:38.570 --> 01:26:39.171
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

1995
01:26:39.171 --> 01:26:41.090
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was the head writer over there,</v>

1996
01:26:41.120 --> 01:26:42.350
<v Speaker 1>so he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1997
01:26:43.070 --> 01:26:44.720
<v Speaker 1>he told me it was a struggle from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning,</v>

1998
01:26:45.110 --> 01:26:48.080
<v Speaker 1>but it was also that they were trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do the same show.</v>

1999
01:26:48.140 --> 01:26:51.410
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to do the exact same show</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they did in the 1990s,</v>

2000
01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:55.100
<v Speaker 1>which is really strange because I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying he was a likable guy.</v>

2001
01:26:55.220 --> 01:26:56.080
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people love them,</v>

2002
01:26:56.081 --> 01:26:58.850
<v Speaker 1>but it seems like if you found the right</v>
<v Speaker 1>vehicle for him,</v>

2003
01:26:59.150 --> 01:27:03.080
<v Speaker 1>he'd be a great talk show host people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's genuinely friendly,</v>

2004
01:27:03.081 --> 01:27:04.920
<v Speaker 1>likable guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2005
01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:06.140
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

2006
01:27:06.170 --> 01:27:08.690
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looked like the exact same fucking</v>

2007
01:27:08.691 --> 01:27:11.570
<v Speaker 1>show and I felt like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did I just like miss that this thing was</v>

2008
01:27:11.571 --> 01:27:14.450
<v Speaker 1>still going on and then he had all these</v>
<v Speaker 1>guests from back then.</v>

2009
01:27:14.750 --> 01:27:15.610
<v Speaker 1>I think that that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2010
01:27:15.620 --> 01:27:16.810
<v Speaker 1>I think the whole thing could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2011
01:27:17.800 --> 01:27:19.090
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dunno.</v>

2012
01:27:19.740 --> 01:27:21.680
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want to just stop when I would</v>

2013
01:27:21.681 --> 01:27:24.770
<v Speaker 1>put it on when it first started.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe just did that the first week.</v>

2014
01:27:26.360 --> 01:27:27.260
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2015
01:27:27.320 --> 01:27:28.250
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He kept doing it.</v>

2016
01:27:28.690 --> 01:27:29.523
<v Speaker 1>They kept doing it.</v>

2017
01:27:29.840 --> 01:27:32.000
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they kind of does what they did.</v>

2018
01:27:32.090 --> 01:27:33.560
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might've altered a little bit,</v>

2019
01:27:33.561 --> 01:27:38.030
<v Speaker 1>but that was essentially the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to do those fucking shows,</v>

2020
01:27:38.031 --> 01:27:39.170
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could never,</v>

2021
01:27:39.171 --> 01:27:40.940
<v Speaker 1>I can have a host to talk shop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No fucking way.</v>

2022
01:27:41.120 --> 01:27:43.190
<v Speaker 1>You don't get to choose your guests.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2023
01:27:43.191 --> 01:27:46.520
<v Speaker 1>like people equate a podcast to a talk</v>
<v Speaker 1>show sometimes.</v>

2024
01:27:46.521 --> 01:27:48.920
<v Speaker 1>But the thing about a podcast is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2025
01:27:49.490 --> 01:27:51.650
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like you like I want,</v>

2026
01:27:51.830 --> 01:27:54.270
<v Speaker 1>I want her to talk to you today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tell you man,</v>

2027
01:27:54.280 --> 01:27:55.970
<v Speaker 1>like you man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know what I'm saying?</v>

2028
01:27:55.971 --> 01:27:58.490
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't have to pretend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like if you were some guy that I</v>

2029
01:27:58.491 --> 01:28:01.130
<v Speaker 1>didn't know that was in here that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>pitching something I didn't give a fuck</v>

2030
01:28:01.131 --> 01:28:04.250
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the network that my story is a dying</v>

2031
01:28:04.251 --> 01:28:06.410
<v Speaker 1>and then you got to save them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2032
01:28:06.411 --> 01:28:07.100
<v Speaker 1>those are the worst.</v>

2033
01:28:07.100 --> 01:28:08.140
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so on.</v>

2034
01:28:08.210 --> 01:28:10.390
<v Speaker 1>We'd have to jump in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2035
01:28:10.420 --> 01:28:10.920
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2036
01:28:10.920 --> 01:28:12.680

<v Speaker 1>I feel bad for,</v>

2037
01:28:12.681 --> 01:28:13.330
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

2038
01:28:13.330 --> 01:28:16.420
<v Speaker 1>when I see a talk show host and has a</v>
<v Speaker 1>guest where they're off or they're</v>

2039

2041
01:28:21.230 --> 01:28:24.140
<v Speaker 1>you see him like glancing down at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>card and then they got to like</v>

01:28:24.280 --> 01:28:28.280

<v Speaker 1>cause it'll just openly mock the</v>

2043

<v Speaker 1>situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'll just openly mock you if it goes</v>

<v Speaker 1>wrong like that.</v>

2199
01:35:03.440 --> 01:35:07.430
<v Speaker 3>I'll probably set up a fake civilization</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then be outside of that civilization</v>

2200
01:35:07.431 --> 01:35:10.910
<v Speaker 3>and the real civilization like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so people come in to raid and then</v>

2238
01:36:45.461 --> 01:36:49.600
<v Speaker 3>that even if the human race survives,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eventually it won't,</v>

2239
01:36:50.020 --> 01:36:53.290
<v Speaker 3>whether it's a million or a billion</v>
<v Speaker 3>years from now,</v>

2240
01:36:53.291 --> 01:36:57.340

2258
01:37:39.491 --> 01:37:41.740
<v Speaker 2>drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what you do when you take some</v>

2259
01:37:41.741 --> 01:37:43.570
<v Speaker 2>bread and you leave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2260
01:37:43.571 --> 01:37:45.160

<v Speaker 2>between sets</v>

2261
01:37:46.750 --> 01:37:50.890
<v Speaker 3>and you fucking eat them like a captain</v>

<v Speaker 2>The only people who are okay,</v>

2265
01:37:59.070 --> 01:38:02.520
<v Speaker 2>it would be if you joined blackwater</v>
<v Speaker 2>where they actually have like a</v>

2266
01:38:02.521 --> 01:38:04.740
<v Speaker 2>fortress.</v>

2267
01:38:04.860 --> 01:38:07.110
<v Speaker 2>My favorite ones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you watch those doomsday preppers</v>

2268
