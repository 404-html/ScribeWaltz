00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.530
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.200
<v Speaker 1>What is that all law about obscenity?</v>

3
00:00:04.201 --> 00:00:05.460
<v Speaker 1>How do you define upset at me?</v>

4
00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.971
<v Speaker 1>That was the,</v>

5
00:00:05.971 --> 00:00:07.590
<v Speaker 1>that's the question in a lot of trials,</v>

6
00:00:07.591 --> 00:00:07.890
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

7
00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.700
<v Speaker 1>Well community standards and this is why it's,</v>

8
00:00:09.701 --> 00:00:11.160
<v Speaker 1>it's in trouble and by the way,</v>

9
00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.980
<v Speaker 1>I would love to know where all like the fucking libertarian political</v>

10
00:00:13.981 --> 00:00:16.920
<v Speaker 1>organizations where when Max hardcore went to jail for four years,</v>

11
00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:18.030
<v Speaker 1>cause they nailed him when he,</v>

12
00:00:18.031 --> 00:00:19.890
<v Speaker 1>when he mailed stuff to fucking Tampa,</v>

13
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.150
<v Speaker 1>Florida stinkers type of stuff and they trapped him and got him on some obscene</v>

14
00:00:24.151 --> 00:00:25.260
<v Speaker 1>community standards thing.</v>

15
00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.240
<v Speaker 1>But we always are.</v>

16
00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:27.450
<v Speaker 1>But he's sticking up for Max hardcore.</v>

17
00:00:27.451 --> 00:00:29.940
<v Speaker 1>This guy did for years for adult pornography.</v>

18
00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:31.140
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking adults.</v>

19
00:00:31.141 --> 00:00:32.490
<v Speaker 1>There was no children involved.</v>

20
00:00:32.491 --> 00:00:37.491
<v Speaker 1>It seems really strange that you could have something that is not illegal.</v>

21
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.670
<v Speaker 1>That is obviously it's marketable.</v>

22
00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.220
<v Speaker 1>I mean whether or not it's healthy to watch that kind of shit.</v>

23
00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.450
<v Speaker 1>It's obviously people are watching it and there was always an argument that</v>

24
00:00:48.451 --> 00:00:52.020
<v Speaker 1>certain types of depravity keeps people from committing things in the real life</v>

25
00:00:52.021 --> 00:00:55.320
<v Speaker 1>that they can get through it in some sort of a fantasy form and it keeps him</v>

26
00:00:55.321 --> 00:00:58.320
<v Speaker 1>from being a creep or a violent person in their real life.</v>

27
00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:01.560
<v Speaker 1>And if someone signs of fucking waiver man and what,</v>

28
00:01:01.561 --> 00:01:02.730
<v Speaker 1>where do you cross the line?</v>

29
00:01:02.731 --> 00:01:05.790
<v Speaker 1>Where do you decide that this is something that this guy needs to get locked in</v>

30
00:01:05.791 --> 00:01:06.624
<v Speaker 1>a cage for?</v>

31
00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:07.703
<v Speaker 1>Cause you don't agree?</v>

32
00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.650
<v Speaker 1>Well the whole country is full of shit when it comes to free speech and free</v>

33
00:01:10.651 --> 00:01:11.910
<v Speaker 1>thought cause all of us,</v>

34
00:01:11.911 --> 00:01:14.010
<v Speaker 1>and I mean I should say all ideologies,</v>

35
00:01:14.011 --> 00:01:15.900
<v Speaker 1>liberal and conservative have an asterisk.</v>

36
00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.140
<v Speaker 1>Like you're free to say this and do this as long as,</v>

37
00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:20.490
<v Speaker 1>and for the liberals,</v>

38
00:01:20.491 --> 00:01:23.700
<v Speaker 1>it's what they call hate speech and anything that's racial or homophobia.</v>

39
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.200
<v Speaker 1>And for the Conservatives it's,</v>

40
00:01:25.201 --> 00:01:25.351
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

41
00:01:25.351 --> 00:01:26.760
<v Speaker 1>don't fuck with God and country.</v>

42
00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.660
<v Speaker 1>But both sides are equally phony when it comes to like when's the last time,</v>

43
00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.650
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

44
00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:31.981
<v Speaker 1>like you know,</v>

45
00:01:31.981 --> 00:01:36.981
<v Speaker 1>a feminist stuck up for a guy who said something about women that was unpleasant</v>

46
00:01:37.471 --> 00:01:38.910
<v Speaker 1>because he has the right to say it.</v>

47
00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.380
<v Speaker 1>Never like we were all these people when Tracy Morgan said what he said,</v>

48
00:01:43.381 --> 00:01:45.750
<v Speaker 1>why did nobody who didn't like him stick up for him?</v>

49
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:46.733
<v Speaker 1>Oh Gosh,</v>

50
00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.040
<v Speaker 1>I think this is like the don't have that much resources.</v>

51
00:01:50.041 --> 00:01:53.820
<v Speaker 1>So it's not like they can jump into the fray on for any little situation.</v>

52
00:01:53.821 --> 00:01:54.870
<v Speaker 1>They don't have that much time.</v>

53
00:01:54.871 --> 00:01:58.530
<v Speaker 1>When you're running some sort of an organization that's looking for violence</v>

54
00:01:58.531 --> 00:02:00.870
<v Speaker 1>against women or anything but mean you don't have,</v>

55
00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.060
<v Speaker 1>you have to look at concentrate only on that.</v>

56
00:02:03.061 --> 00:02:08.061
<v Speaker 1>I don't fault them for going after or not going after cases where guys like</v>

57
00:02:08.611 --> 00:02:10.100
<v Speaker 1>Tracy Morgan got [inaudible].</v>

58
00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.810
<v Speaker 1>Now they only have a certain amount of things they want to concentrate on.</v>

59
00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.021
<v Speaker 1>But no,</v>

60
00:02:13.021 --> 00:02:16.060
<v Speaker 1>I mean I fault him for going after him because I,</v>

61
00:02:16.061 --> 00:02:16.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

62
00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:17.570
<v Speaker 1>he's white like white.</v>

63
00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:18.900
<v Speaker 1>Like when people went after him,</v>

64
00:02:18.901 --> 00:02:20.490
<v Speaker 1>why didn't they just stick up for him and go,</v>

65
00:02:20.491 --> 00:02:21.720
<v Speaker 1>we don't like what he said,</v>

66
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.600
<v Speaker 1>but he's got the right to say it and there should be no penalty for it.</v>

67
00:02:24.601 --> 00:02:25.410
<v Speaker 1>That's what I mean.</v>

68
00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:26.280
<v Speaker 1>And none of these groups,</v>

69
00:02:26.281 --> 00:02:28.800
<v Speaker 1>which would take them two seconds to put out that fucking memo,</v>

70
00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.150
<v Speaker 1>but glad has never done it.</v>

71
00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:31.133
<v Speaker 1>None of them have done it.</v>

72
00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.471
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

73
00:02:31.471 --> 00:02:31.590
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

74
00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.790
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

75
00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.490
<v Speaker 1>they don't devote any resources to helping anybody else out there develop</v>

76
00:02:35.491 --> 00:02:39.870
<v Speaker 1>resources to pushing their ideology and their ideology is that this guy needs to</v>

77
00:02:39.871 --> 00:02:40.650
<v Speaker 1>be punished,</v>

78
00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.831
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

79
00:02:40.831 --> 00:02:42.930
<v Speaker 1>Because if he's punished and it cost him a lot of money,</v>

80
00:02:42.931 --> 00:02:44.580
<v Speaker 1>then people are going to stop thinking like that.</v>

81
00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.470
<v Speaker 1>You're going to stop expressing themselves like that,</v>

82
00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:50.820
<v Speaker 1>which I can see their point it up to a certain point where you got to realize</v>

83
00:02:50.821 --> 00:02:51.401
<v Speaker 1>like if is,</v>

84
00:02:51.401 --> 00:02:52.380
<v Speaker 1>is it okay,</v>

85
00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:53.550
<v Speaker 1>where does this,</v>

86
00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:54.120
<v Speaker 1>where does this,</v>

87
00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.410
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

88
00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:55.420
<v Speaker 1>where's this line happen?</v>

89
00:02:55.421 --> 00:02:59.860
<v Speaker 1>Is it okay for Denzel Washington to play a murderer and a gangster and a movie?</v>

90
00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:00.461
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

91
00:03:00.461 --> 00:03:01.150
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

92
00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.870
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

93
00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.870
<v Speaker 1>Why is it not okay for Tracy Morgan to portray a guy who's pretending that he</v>

94
00:03:07.481 --> 00:03:10.840
<v Speaker 1>would stab is Sonifi was gay because he's not telling the truth.</v>

95
00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:11.430
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

96
00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.760
<v Speaker 1>he's gay.</v>

97
00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.150
<v Speaker 1>He's obviously doing a character that is like completely over the top and says</v>

98
00:03:16.151 --> 00:03:17.380
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous shit all the time.</v>

99
00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:18.250
<v Speaker 1>That is,</v>

100
00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:19.420
<v Speaker 1>that's his shtick.</v>

101
00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.691
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>

102
00:03:19.691 --> 00:03:20.080
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

103
00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.640
<v Speaker 1>I was incorrect when I apologize.</v>

104
00:03:21.641 --> 00:03:22.331
<v Speaker 1>You just straighten me out.</v>

105
00:03:22.331 --> 00:03:23.280
<v Speaker 1>When I said the women's groups,</v>

106
00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:24.280
<v Speaker 1>I should have said the gay groups.</v>

107
00:03:24.281 --> 00:03:24.941
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking that it was,</v>

108
00:03:24.941 --> 00:03:27.340
<v Speaker 1>Tracy said something that was anti woman.</v>

109
00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:28.270
<v Speaker 1>I forgot that it was that.</v>

110
00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.040
<v Speaker 1>I actually forgot what I just went with the conflict.</v>

111
00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:31.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying why doesn't the group who's a,</v>

112
00:03:31.421 --> 00:03:32.800
<v Speaker 1>you're saying that gay dudes are women.</v>

113
00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:33.881
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

114
00:03:33.881 --> 00:03:34.810
<v Speaker 1>so all the great ones are,</v>

115
00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:35.021
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

116
00:03:35.021 --> 00:03:35.854
<v Speaker 1>let's be honest,</v>

117
00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.260
<v Speaker 1>who hasn't seen a transsexual and fallen in love?</v>

118
00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:40.240
<v Speaker 1>It's an open society folks.</v>

119
00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:40.961
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

120
00:03:40.961 --> 00:03:43.450
<v Speaker 1>I think Tracy got you.</v>

121
00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.660
<v Speaker 1>People have to understand that there's people that want to see him do that.</v>

122
00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:48.310
<v Speaker 1>You might not like it,</v>

123
00:03:48.311 --> 00:03:49.210
<v Speaker 1>but it's like dice.</v>

124
00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:50.170
<v Speaker 1>I'd love dice.</v>

125
00:03:50.171 --> 00:03:51.340
<v Speaker 1>I've always loved dice.</v>

126
00:03:51.341 --> 00:03:53.470
<v Speaker 1>I want to see him go fucking bananas.</v>

127
00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:54.920
<v Speaker 1>It's a form of entertainment.</v>

128
00:03:54.921 --> 00:03:56.200
<v Speaker 1>And if he does it about Italians,</v>

129
00:03:56.201 --> 00:03:57.034
<v Speaker 1>which I am,</v>

130
00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:57.521
<v Speaker 1>I will,</v>

131
00:03:57.521 --> 00:03:58.300
<v Speaker 1>I will laugh.</v>

132
00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:59.320
<v Speaker 1>I will laugh along with it.</v>

133
00:03:59.321 --> 00:03:59.891
<v Speaker 1>Cause I know,</v>

134
00:03:59.891 --> 00:04:00.251
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

135
00:04:00.251 --> 00:04:01.210
<v Speaker 1>if he's making fun of us,</v>

136
00:04:01.211 --> 00:04:01.380
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

137
00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:02.950
<v Speaker 1>it's mostly true shit,</v>

138
00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:03.671
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

139
00:04:03.671 --> 00:04:05.380
<v Speaker 1>But for whatever reason,</v>

140
00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:07.210
<v Speaker 1>some people want to pretend that you know,</v>

141
00:04:07.211 --> 00:04:10.630
<v Speaker 1>some of his ridiculous over the top stereotypes aren't funny.</v>

142
00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.940
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's a crew delirious character.</v>

143
00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:15.570
<v Speaker 1>This character of fucking hates that break man.</v>

144
00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.691
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>

145
00:04:16.691 --> 00:04:18.040
<v Speaker 1>It's great entertainment.</v>

146
00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:18.221
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

147
00:04:18.221 --> 00:04:18.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

148
00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.890
<v Speaker 1>swallow my load yet chew.</v>

149
00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:22.990
<v Speaker 1>It takes that seriously.</v>

150
00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:24.370
<v Speaker 1>Why would you be angry?</v>

151
00:04:24.371 --> 00:04:24.791
<v Speaker 1>This guy,</v>

152
00:04:24.791 --> 00:04:25.120
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

153
00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.631
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

154
00:04:25.631 --> 00:04:26.470
<v Speaker 1>this is just,</v>

155
00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:27.790
<v Speaker 1>this is entertainment.</v>

156
00:04:27.791 --> 00:04:29.140
<v Speaker 1>It's comedy and it's a,</v>

157
00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:32.110
<v Speaker 1>it's a valid form of comedy and this is where it gets weird.</v>

158
00:04:32.111 --> 00:04:33.360
<v Speaker 1>It's like when you,</v>

159
00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.360
<v Speaker 1>when a guy's creating art and to break,</v>

160
00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:35.981
<v Speaker 1>believe it or not,</v>

161
00:04:35.981 --> 00:04:39.130
<v Speaker 1>Tracy Morgan's creating fucking art when he gets on stage and he does standup</v>

162
00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:40.263
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

163
00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:44.530
<v Speaker 1>he's not trying to fucking piss people off.</v>

164
00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:45.820
<v Speaker 1>He's just going with,</v>

165
00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:47.170
<v Speaker 1>this is one of the,</v>

166
00:04:47.171 --> 00:04:48.910
<v Speaker 1>this is one of the styles of comedy.</v>

167
00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:51.400
<v Speaker 1>You say completely outrageous shit.</v>

168
00:04:51.401 --> 00:04:54.850
<v Speaker 1>We all know guys who would sit like Brian Holtzman is one of my perfect</v>

169
00:04:54.851 --> 00:04:55.331
<v Speaker 1>examples.</v>

170
00:04:55.331 --> 00:04:55.530
<v Speaker 1>You need,</v>

171
00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:56.351
<v Speaker 1>do you know Brian?</v>

172
00:04:56.351 --> 00:04:56.560
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

173
00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:57.221
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying the Harry's.</v>

174
00:04:57.221 --> 00:04:57.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

175
00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:00.010
<v Speaker 1>He did a joke about Susan Smith after,</v>

176
00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:02.620
<v Speaker 1>after Susan Smith got caught drowning.</v>

177
00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:05.440
<v Speaker 1>He goes on stage like two days later and he goes,</v>

178
00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.380
<v Speaker 1>the Susan Smith case and she'd drawn a kid.</v>

179
00:05:08.381 --> 00:05:09.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

180
00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:10.210
<v Speaker 1>I heard those were bad kids.</v>

181
00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:12.760
<v Speaker 1>I heard they sat that close to the TV.</v>

182
00:05:12.761 --> 00:05:14.170
<v Speaker 1>They always spelt a fucking milk.</v>

183
00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:15.430
<v Speaker 1>They don't put away their blocks.</v>

184
00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:20.730
<v Speaker 1>Those kids will not be missed and we were laughing and gang the whole audience.</v>

185
00:05:22.301 --> 00:05:26.890
<v Speaker 1>It was a combination of laughs and gasps and that's a valid piece of art.</v>

186
00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:28.300
<v Speaker 1>That's a valid piece of art.</v>

187
00:05:28.301 --> 00:05:30.310
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't really mean that he doesn't,</v>

188
00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:31.990
<v Speaker 1>if he had to choose,</v>

189
00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:32.531
<v Speaker 1>he would say,</v>

190
00:05:32.531 --> 00:05:32.861
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

191
00:05:32.861 --> 00:05:35.650
<v Speaker 1>please go back in time and stop her before she tells her children.</v>

192
00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:36.940
<v Speaker 1>He's a character.</v>

193
00:05:36.941 --> 00:05:40.330
<v Speaker 1>He's playing a crazy accentuated character.</v>

194
00:05:40.331 --> 00:05:42.310
<v Speaker 1>He gets into a zone and he does this,</v>

195
00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:46.600
<v Speaker 1>this thing on stage and he says like really offensive shit and it's fucking</v>

196
00:05:46.601 --> 00:05:48.220
<v Speaker 1>funny and I enjoy it.</v>

197
00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:52.480
<v Speaker 1>It's art or even when you're just being yourself and exploring a ridiculous</v>

198
00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:53.440
<v Speaker 1>concept.</v>

199
00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:54.370
<v Speaker 1>But we never,</v>

200
00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.050
<v Speaker 1>people never stick up for that.</v>

201
00:05:56.051 --> 00:06:00.260
<v Speaker 1>And the same people that would defend maple Thorpe or any other form of art,</v>

202
00:06:00.261 --> 00:06:02.480
<v Speaker 1>piss Christ in a jar are the same.</v>

203
00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:06.110
<v Speaker 1>There's the same mentality that will attack Tracy or that will attack,</v>

204
00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:07.093
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

205
00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:08.240
<v Speaker 1>I missed what he said,</v>

206
00:06:08.241 --> 00:06:08.990
<v Speaker 1>or Michael Richards.</v>

207
00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:12.260
<v Speaker 1>It's a fraudulent stance and every side does it.</v>

208
00:06:12.261 --> 00:06:13.670
<v Speaker 1>It drives me fucking crazy.</v>

209
00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:14.241
<v Speaker 1>I think there's,</v>

210
00:06:14.241 --> 00:06:14.660
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

211
00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:16.730
<v Speaker 1>it's cause cause people have this idea,</v>

212
00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:20.870
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people I should say have this idea that if you don't agree with them,</v>

213
00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:23.510
<v Speaker 1>you're wrong and your,</v>

214
00:06:23.511 --> 00:06:23.841
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

215
00:06:23.841 --> 00:06:24.171
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

216
00:06:24.171 --> 00:06:24.490
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

217
00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:24.951
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>

218
00:06:24.951 --> 00:06:25.130
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

219
00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:26.210
<v Speaker 1>you're against them.</v>

220
00:06:26.211 --> 00:06:26.690
<v Speaker 1>You don't,</v>

221
00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:30.320
<v Speaker 1>it's not like you can enjoy different things or have different ideas about</v>

222
00:06:30.321 --> 00:06:32.640
<v Speaker 1>different standards of living and what you shouldn't,</v>

223
00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:33.380
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't be able to do.</v>

224
00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:33.561
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

225
00:06:33.561 --> 00:06:34.100
<v Speaker 1>it's not that.</v>

226
00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:34.261
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

227
00:06:34.261 --> 00:06:35.390
<v Speaker 1>if you don't agree,</v>

228
00:06:35.391 --> 00:06:36.440
<v Speaker 1>you're wrong.</v>

229
00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:39.830
<v Speaker 1>And people have to understand that different people like different shit.</v>

230
00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:40.060
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

231
00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:43.790
<v Speaker 1>And you can't force someone to not like porn.</v>

232
00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:47.060
<v Speaker 1>You can't force someone to say you're not gay.</v>

233
00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:47.391
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

234
00:06:47.391 --> 00:06:47.551
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

235
00:06:47.551 --> 00:06:48.530
<v Speaker 1>you cannot be gay.</v>

236
00:06:48.531 --> 00:06:48.890
<v Speaker 1>We're not all,</v>

237
00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:49.611
<v Speaker 1>you can't do that.</v>

238
00:06:49.611 --> 00:06:50.540
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't work.</v>

239
00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:53.420
<v Speaker 1>Like you have to let people do whatever the fuck they want to do and then you</v>

240
00:06:53.421 --> 00:06:55.250
<v Speaker 1>just got to kind of accept that that's them.</v>

241
00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:57.290
<v Speaker 1>And I wish a lot of these phony artists like,</v>

242
00:06:57.291 --> 00:06:57.951
<v Speaker 1>and I say phony,</v>

243
00:06:57.951 --> 00:06:58.080
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

244
00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:58.970
<v Speaker 1>I mean many singers,</v>

245
00:06:58.971 --> 00:07:00.980
<v Speaker 1>I think that they're hit by attacking Christianity.</v>

246
00:07:00.981 --> 00:07:03.650
<v Speaker 1>Like I have no prob attack Christianity fucking shorts right there.</v>

247
00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:06.260
<v Speaker 1>But it's like none of them address Islam.</v>

248
00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.080
<v Speaker 1>None of them are addressed.</v>

249
00:07:08.081 --> 00:07:09.740
<v Speaker 1>The fact that they're afraid to attack is,</v>

250
00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:13.550
<v Speaker 1>and that's what drives me crazy because it's this fucking fake edge.</v>

251
00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:14.091
<v Speaker 1>It's the,</v>

252
00:07:14.091 --> 00:07:15.350
<v Speaker 1>it's this fucking fake.</v>

253
00:07:15.351 --> 00:07:16.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm being dangerous.</v>

254
00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:17.181
<v Speaker 1>But it's really,</v>

255
00:07:17.181 --> 00:07:19.970
<v Speaker 1>they're looking both ways before they cross the street and they're acting like</v>

256
00:07:19.971 --> 00:07:22.610
<v Speaker 1>they just bolted out the front door and it fucking drives me.</v>

257
00:07:22.611 --> 00:07:23.690
<v Speaker 1>It drives me nuts.</v>

258
00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:24.621
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

259
00:07:24.621 --> 00:07:25.520
<v Speaker 1>It's the,</v>

260
00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:25.780
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

261
00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:28.640
<v Speaker 1>there's a certain amount of posturing that people,</v>

262
00:07:28.641 --> 00:07:29.000
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

263
00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.050
<v Speaker 1>people get into when they start talking about certain political issues and</v>

264
00:07:33.051 --> 00:07:35.000
<v Speaker 1>certain things and certain ideologies.</v>

265
00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:39.200
<v Speaker 1>And it gets to like that gross place where people just start clapping and you</v>

266
00:07:39.201 --> 00:07:40.610
<v Speaker 1>can tell they're disingenuous.</v>

267
00:07:40.611 --> 00:07:41.210
<v Speaker 1>And it just,</v>

268
00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:43.880
<v Speaker 1>there are milking off this thing for their own ego.</v>

269
00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:47.240
<v Speaker 1>They're milking off this reality for their own ego instead of just sort of</v>

270
00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:48.170
<v Speaker 1>trying to,</v>

271
00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:49.003
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

272
00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:50.740
<v Speaker 1>trying to look at the big picture because the,</v>

273
00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:51.583
<v Speaker 1>the big,</v>

274
00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:53.060
<v Speaker 1>you mean what?</v>

275
00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:54.170
<v Speaker 1>You're absolutely right.</v>

276
00:07:54.171 --> 00:07:56.150
<v Speaker 1>Why doesn't anybody want to make fun of Islam?</v>

277
00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:56.750
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you why.</v>

278
00:07:56.750 --> 00:07:57.980
<v Speaker 1>Because they'll fucking kill you.</v>

279
00:07:58.030 --> 00:07:58.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

280
00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:02.840
<v Speaker 1>Like they took shit to an entirely different place and so anybody who wants to</v>

281
00:08:02.841 --> 00:08:03.950
<v Speaker 1>pretend to be edgy,</v>

282
00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:05.720
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't involve going that far.</v>

283
00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:07.230
<v Speaker 1>I mock them but I mean I can,</v>

284
00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:09.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm careful where I put the Joe come out an idiot.</v>

285
00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:10.940
<v Speaker 1>You know crazy though.</v>

286
00:08:10.941 --> 00:08:13.820
<v Speaker 1>You right now just admitted to self censorship for the same thing.</v>

287
00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:17.900
<v Speaker 1>You just find it more reasonable because you say that your take on it as well</v>

288
00:08:17.901 --> 00:08:18.020
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

289
00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:18.291
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

290
00:08:18.291 --> 00:08:19.280
<v Speaker 1>I'll take it back a little bit,</v>

291
00:08:19.281 --> 00:08:19.431
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

292
00:08:19.431 --> 00:08:20.180
<v Speaker 1>as far as I know,</v>

293
00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:23.540
<v Speaker 1>but you are clearly saying that you wouldn't say what you'd normally would want</v>

294
00:08:23.541 --> 00:08:24.590
<v Speaker 1>to say because they're dangerous.</v>

295
00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:25.330
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

296
00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:25.640
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

297
00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:27.200
<v Speaker 1>but I will say that that's why I'm not saying it.</v>

298
00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:28.093
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that amazing.</v>

299
00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:33.230
<v Speaker 1>It's a terrifying thing in 2012 that we still have a faction of our world that</v>

300
00:08:33.621 --> 00:08:36.320
<v Speaker 1>you have to literally can't draw their guy.</v>

301
00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:39.740
<v Speaker 1>But I also won't say other things on stage for feeling like,</v>

302
00:08:39.741 --> 00:08:40.161
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

303
00:08:40.161 --> 00:08:40.401
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

304
00:08:40.401 --> 00:08:40.701
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

305
00:08:40.701 --> 00:08:42.430
<v Speaker 1>a nigger is a rough word to pull out.</v>

306
00:08:42.431 --> 00:08:45.110
<v Speaker 1>You better have a reason before you say that on stage.</v>

307
00:08:45.111 --> 00:08:45.801
<v Speaker 1>You can't just go out.</v>

308
00:08:45.801 --> 00:08:47.580
<v Speaker 1>And I would never say it an anger at somebody,</v>

309
00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:49.610
<v Speaker 1>but it's like every,</v>

310
00:08:49.611 --> 00:08:52.700
<v Speaker 1>everything has lines and stuff and reasons I don't say it.</v>

311
00:08:52.701 --> 00:08:55.560
<v Speaker 1>And I do self sensor and I think we all do as comics.</v>

312
00:08:55.561 --> 00:08:56.281
<v Speaker 1>You Ha you have to.</v>

313
00:08:56.281 --> 00:08:57.114
<v Speaker 1>We're not crazy,</v>

314
00:08:57.630 --> 00:08:59.460
<v Speaker 1>but I never want people panelize when they don't.</v>

315
00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:00.320
<v Speaker 1>That's the difference.</v>

316
00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:00.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

317
00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:01.273
<v Speaker 1>Well it's horrible.</v>

318
00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:30.031
<v Speaker 1>You ready to,</v>

319
00:09:30.031 --> 00:09:31.690
<v Speaker 1>of course record.</v>

320
00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:32.081
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

321
00:09:32.081 --> 00:09:32.914
<v Speaker 1>it is already.</v>

322
00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:34.000
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck's on?</v>
