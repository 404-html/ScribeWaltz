1
00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:03.823
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.490
<v Speaker 2>And we're back to wrap it up.</v>

3
00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:17.720
<v Speaker 2>We just stepped outside.</v>

4
00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.510
<v Speaker 2>Sacrifice the sacred plant to the fire gods.</v>

5
00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.410
<v Speaker 2>If you try to just put Brian in a better state of mind,</v>

6
00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.950
<v Speaker 2>I think you feel like a lot of people are attacking you and um,</v>

7
00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:28.730
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

8
00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.080
<v Speaker 2>I get attacked a lot nowadays.</v>

9
00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:31.010
<v Speaker 2>I know you do.</v>

10
00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:32.150
<v Speaker 2>I talked about that earlier,</v>

11
00:00:32.151 --> 00:00:33.110
<v Speaker 2>but we're not attacking you.</v>

12
00:00:33.111 --> 00:00:37.280
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things that I think that's real important that I brought up</v>

13
00:00:37.281 --> 00:00:38.900
<v Speaker 2>earlier is B,</v>

14
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.870
<v Speaker 2>be generous to a point where it's indefensible.</v>

15
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.180
<v Speaker 2>Be Generous to a point where you know,</v>

16
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.290
<v Speaker 2>you people know that what you're doing is you're doing it all for the right</v>

17
00:00:48.291 --> 00:00:48.610
<v Speaker 2>reason,</v>

18
00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.960
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

19
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.000
<v Speaker 3>I think if you're a listener,</v>

20
00:00:50.001 --> 00:00:51.950
<v Speaker 3>you know that already what I did for comedy,</v>

21
00:00:51.951 --> 00:00:54.230
<v Speaker 3>and that was the one thing I started screaming at Dunkin was like,</v>

22
00:00:54.231 --> 00:00:56.030
<v Speaker 3>you don't understand how much I do for comics.</v>

23
00:00:56.031 --> 00:01:00.140
<v Speaker 3>My free time is devoted to 100% of doing shit for free for other comics.</v>

24
00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:00.711
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

25
00:01:00.711 --> 00:01:01.790
<v Speaker 3>if they will tell you what,</v>

26
00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:03.200
<v Speaker 3>I will tell you this though,</v>

27
00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.770
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of clubs over the years that have had this theory that,</v>

28
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.951
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

29
00:01:06.951 --> 00:01:10.130
<v Speaker 3>you're lucky to be getting the stage time and a part of comedians.</v>

30
00:01:10.131 --> 00:01:11.050
<v Speaker 3>We don't respect ourselves.</v>

31
00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.360
<v Speaker 3>We were like,</v>

32
00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.050
<v Speaker 3>absolutely,</v>

33
00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.830
<v Speaker 3>you're absolutely right.</v>

34
00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:13.790
<v Speaker 3>But the other part is like,</v>

35
00:01:13.791 --> 00:01:14.391
<v Speaker 3>fuck yeah,</v>

36
00:01:14.391 --> 00:01:18.400
<v Speaker 3>but I'm also not driving to pass a dean yet fucking editing audio software for</v>

37
00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.621
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

38
00:01:18.621 --> 00:01:20.240
<v Speaker 3>I'm not fucking doing all this shit.</v>

39
00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.130
<v Speaker 3>That's not the same as saying like,</v>

40
00:01:22.131 --> 00:01:22.371
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

41
00:01:22.371 --> 00:01:23.204
<v Speaker 3>you should be listening</v>

42
00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.360
<v Speaker 2>what you're doing.</v>

43
00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:24.730
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

44
00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:25.020
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

45
00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.351
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

46
00:01:25.351 --> 00:01:26.161
<v Speaker 2>this is what you're doing.</v>

47
00:01:26.161 --> 00:01:28.410
<v Speaker 2>You set up a beautiful thing right there.</v>

48
00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:29.280
<v Speaker 2>They ain't bad.</v>

49
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.420
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing wrong with that.</v>

50
00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:31.231
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

51
00:01:31.231 --> 00:01:34.980
<v Speaker 2>when I asked you about how many shows do you want just to sort of eliminate</v>

52
00:01:34.981 --> 00:01:36.240
<v Speaker 2>people as to what you're doing?</v>

53
00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:37.020
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

54
00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.920
<v Speaker 2>I like what you're doing.</v>

55
00:01:37.921 --> 00:01:40.080
<v Speaker 2>I like a lot of shows that come out of what you're doing,</v>

56
00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.560
<v Speaker 2>but I think that we have to always be very careful that if there's any money</v>

57
00:01:45.661 --> 00:01:47.550
<v Speaker 2>that's ever taking place in,</v>

58
00:01:47.551 --> 00:01:49.770
<v Speaker 2>in any sort of a thing where you're selling comedy,</v>

59
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.100
<v Speaker 2>comedians get super defensive and super sensitive when you're selling a show and</v>

60
00:01:57.631 --> 00:02:00.360
<v Speaker 2>the comics are going to go up and do their standup and they're not going to get</v>

61
00:02:00.361 --> 00:02:01.320
<v Speaker 2>compensated from it,</v>

62
00:02:01.321 --> 00:02:03.510
<v Speaker 2>but yet they know that money is exchanging hands</v>

63
00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.160
<v Speaker 3>a show that people didn't use it as a workout room.</v>

64
00:02:06.161 --> 00:02:07.350
<v Speaker 3>For the most part I,</v>

65
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.630
<v Speaker 3>these are people that just like fucking around like not actually like I'm</v>

66
00:02:10.631 --> 00:02:11.171
<v Speaker 3>selling in.</v>

67
00:02:11.171 --> 00:02:14.710
<v Speaker 3>Plus the fact that there's like seven or eight people usually on each one of</v>

68
00:02:14.711 --> 00:02:15.544
<v Speaker 3>these shows.</v>

69
00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.320
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a little different than if I were like,</v>

70
00:02:17.321 --> 00:02:17.801
<v Speaker 3>hey me,</v>

71
00:02:17.801 --> 00:02:20.440
<v Speaker 3>Ari and you are doing a show at the Hollywood and scales and stuff.</v>

72
00:02:20.441 --> 00:02:21.290
<v Speaker 3>While you wouldn't have it.</v>

73
00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:22.251
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

74
00:02:22.251 --> 00:02:26.120
<v Speaker 2>the reason why you get to control this money at all is because I gave it to you</v>

75
00:02:26.121 --> 00:02:26.780
<v Speaker 2>because I don't,</v>

76
00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.290
<v Speaker 2>I can you to rent that place out.</v>

77
00:02:30.291 --> 00:02:30.951
<v Speaker 2>And since then I'm like,</v>

78
00:02:30.951 --> 00:02:31.161
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

79
00:02:31.161 --> 00:02:33.320
<v Speaker 2>I'll give you all my money from my shows.</v>

80
00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.570
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

81
00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.040
<v Speaker 2>So you chose,</v>

82
00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.740
<v Speaker 2>we'll sell it.</v>

83
00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.910
<v Speaker 2>You do.</v>

84
00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:36.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

85
00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.801
<v Speaker 2>It shows I do,</v>

86
00:02:36.801 --> 00:02:38.360
<v Speaker 2>or 90% of the shows that go on there.</v>

87
00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.810
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

88
00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:39.920
<v Speaker 2>I do them every week.</v>

89
00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.450
<v Speaker 2>You say you're not lot.</v>

90
00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:42.051
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

91
00:02:42.051 --> 00:02:42.950
<v Speaker 2>let's onsite nineties.</v>

92
00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:43.940
<v Speaker 2>It's more than half.</v>

93
00:02:43.941 --> 00:02:44.571
<v Speaker 2>More than half.</v>

94
00:02:44.571 --> 00:02:46.850
<v Speaker 2>And that's more than pays the rent.</v>

95
00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.450
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

96
00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:47.721
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

97
00:02:47.721 --> 00:02:52.070
<v Speaker 2>the idea being that I think when a comic knows that you're,</v>

98
00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.530
<v Speaker 2>even if you're only making 150 bucks to a comic,</v>

99
00:02:54.531 --> 00:02:55.011
<v Speaker 2>that's like,</v>

100
00:02:55.011 --> 00:02:57.770
<v Speaker 2>why doesn't he make 50 and give us 50?</v>

101
00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.200
<v Speaker 2>That's how they think you're selling standup</v>

102
00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.541
<v Speaker 3>comedy.</v>

103
00:03:00.541 --> 00:03:01.374
<v Speaker 3>This is why,</v>

104
00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.750
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

105
00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:02.160
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

106
00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.530
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

107
00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.230
<v Speaker 3>the fact that you guys are doing all this to me,</v>

108
00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:06.300
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

109
00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.641
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

110
00:03:06.641 --> 00:03:07.420
<v Speaker 3>bottom line.</v>

111
00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:12.130
<v Speaker 3>Each one of these shows for going in there and being there for five hours for</v>

112
00:03:12.131 --> 00:03:14.560
<v Speaker 3>going in there and putting together all these comics,</v>

113
00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:15.100
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

114
00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.430
<v Speaker 3>putting,</v>

115
00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.950
<v Speaker 3>putting up advertising and making posters for it.</v>

116
00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.401
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

117
00:03:18.401 --> 00:03:18.751
<v Speaker 3>all the,</v>

118
00:03:18.751 --> 00:03:19.510
<v Speaker 3>all this,</v>

119
00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:20.343
<v Speaker 3>all this,</v>

120
00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:21.281
<v Speaker 3>all this shit.</v>

121
00:03:21.281 --> 00:03:26.281
<v Speaker 3>If it's not worth $150 is not worth $150 and I'm not doing it.</v>

122
00:03:26.351 --> 00:03:29.680
<v Speaker 3>If I'm getting this much trouble for 150 bucks,</v>

123
00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:30.371
<v Speaker 3>fuck bucket,</v>

124
00:03:30.371 --> 00:03:31.250
<v Speaker 3>then I'm not doing,</v>

125
00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.631
<v Speaker 3>hold on,</v>

126
00:03:31.631 --> 00:03:32.020
<v Speaker 3>hold on.</v>

127
00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:33.070

128
00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:34.210
<v Speaker 3>150 bucks,</v>

129
00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:39.210
<v Speaker 3>even at 60% I'd say maybe on average after I'm saying the average after tax that</v>

130
00:03:39.671 --> 00:03:44.671
<v Speaker 3>I get after paying the host and comics or whatever is usually about 150 bucks.</v>

131
00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.501
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

132
00:03:47.501 --> 00:03:47.681
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

133
00:03:47.681 --> 00:03:51.550
<v Speaker 3>if you spending money paying the comics and you feel good about that and you</v>

134
00:03:51.551 --> 00:03:51.791
<v Speaker 3>can,</v>

135
00:03:51.791 --> 00:03:52.061
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

136
00:03:52.061 --> 00:03:53.350
<v Speaker 3>you could sit down with them and say,</v>

137
00:03:53.351 --> 00:03:53.561
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

138
00:03:53.561 --> 00:03:53.681
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

139
00:03:53.681 --> 00:03:56.050
<v Speaker 3>because you know what it the only reason what it is,</v>

140
00:03:56.051 --> 00:03:59.680
<v Speaker 3>it's whoever you heard it from or whatever whispers you heard it from.</v>

141
00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:02.900
<v Speaker 3>And Dunkin for some reason who's been on the show?</v>

142
00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:04.420

143
00:04:04.421 --> 00:04:04.771

144
00:04:04.771 --> 00:04:05.740
<v Speaker 3>it's been on one show.</v>

145
00:04:05.741 --> 00:04:06.400
<v Speaker 3>I like it.</v>

146
00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.151
<v Speaker 3>We'd like to 15 bucks.</v>

147
00:04:07.151 --> 00:04:07.990
<v Speaker 3>We go to the comedy store.</v>

148
00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:09.550
<v Speaker 3>It's just like,</v>

149
00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:11.320
<v Speaker 3>well it's something nominal so I get it.</v>

150
00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:12.573
<v Speaker 3>I get it man.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>

152
00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:14.560
<v Speaker 3>But I'm just saying that after that.</v>

153
00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:15.670
<v Speaker 3>I know what you're saying.</v>

154
00:04:15.671 --> 00:04:16.720
<v Speaker 3>You're saying that you,</v>

155
00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:17.561
<v Speaker 3>it's not worth it to me.</v>

156
00:04:17.561 --> 00:04:20.590
<v Speaker 3>I don't give her saying you doing a good thing by creating the spot for them to</v>

157
00:04:20.591 --> 00:04:23.800
<v Speaker 3>warm up and they don't appreciate that and that if you're not at least getting</v>

158
00:04:23.801 --> 00:04:25.390
<v Speaker 3>something out of it like 150 bucks,</v>

159
00:04:25.391 --> 00:04:26.530
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to just doing it.</v>

160
00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:27.131
<v Speaker 3>Honestly.</v>

161
00:04:27.131 --> 00:04:28.360
<v Speaker 3>You know how hard it is,</v>

162
00:04:28.361 --> 00:04:32.800
<v Speaker 3>like devoting like almost every Friday to being somewhere and on fact of that</v>

163
00:04:32.801 --> 00:04:36.070
<v Speaker 3>being on there for like five or six hours and that's called a job.</v>

164
00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.020
<v Speaker 3>I completely understand that.</v>

165
00:04:38.021 --> 00:04:39.310
<v Speaker 3>The worst night ever,</v>

166
00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:40.540
<v Speaker 3>but two comedians,</v>

167
00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:44.020
<v Speaker 3>they're also doing a job too and they're also selling something valuable.</v>

168
00:04:44.021 --> 00:04:47.710
<v Speaker 3>Their work in their materials and they know that a unit though you are putting</v>

169

<v Speaker 3>together a promotion,</v>

170
00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:50.920
<v Speaker 3>the promoter shouldn't be the only one that's getting money out of it.</v>

171
00:04:50.921 --> 00:04:51.070
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

172
00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.903

<v Speaker 3>you know what it should be?</v>

178
00:04:55.901 --> 00:04:58.990
<v Speaker 3>It should be each one of the comics that come on it either goes,</v>

179
00:04:58.991 --> 00:04:59.171

189
00:05:07.841 --> 00:05:09.360
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I need to deserve comparison,</v>

190
00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:11.230
<v Speaker 3>but compared to me,</v>

191

<v Speaker 3>I will do almost any show for free.</v>

192
00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:16.030
<v Speaker 3>I never care about fucking money at all.</v>

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:24.930
<v Speaker 3>$30 to an MC is 20 paid tickets after the,</v>

199
00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.481
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>

200
00:05:25.481 --> 00:05:26.120
<v Speaker 3>But for comedy,</v>

201
00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.450
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to get paid for the most part,</v>

202
00:05:28.451 --> 00:05:29.800
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that you need to be gay.</v>

203
00:05:29.801 --> 00:05:30.381
<v Speaker 3>I have fun.</v>

204
00:05:30.381 --> 00:05:32.020
<v Speaker 3>So why don't you give up his mind to people?</v>

205
00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:34.720
<v Speaker 3>Why don't you give up the money that people give him 20 bucks a piece.</v>

206
00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:35.780
<v Speaker 3>I'm 40 bucks is what I do.</v>

<v Speaker 3>But you have the deal happen.</v>

208
00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:38.501
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

209
00:05:38.501 --> 00:05:40.450
<v Speaker 3>I haven't got why do you think first time we did that,</v>

210
00:05:40.451 --> 00:05:41.284
<v Speaker 3>why do you think that</v>

211
00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:48.830
<v Speaker 3>pose in any comics that I know that many people have asked for money,</v>

212
00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:51.250
<v Speaker 3>but just because of poor doesn't mean there's less or more deserving of that</v>

213
00:05:51.251 --> 00:05:51.620
<v Speaker 3>money.</v>

214
00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:53.530
<v Speaker 3>No one's five to a spot for 15 minutes.</v>

215
00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:55.960
<v Speaker 3>I don't care if you do a spot for 50 minutes to Joe.</v>

216
00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:57.860
<v Speaker 3>I don't deserve that or less than him.</v>

217
00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:58.480
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

218
00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:58.990
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

219
00:05:58.990 --> 00:05:59.823
<v Speaker 3>no one.</v>

220
00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:02.780
<v Speaker 3>The only time I really ever pay somebody as if I know,</v>

233
00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:14.720

234
00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:15.071

00:06:29.631 --> 00:06:30.161
<v Speaker 3>you want to do it.</v>

243
00:06:30.161 --> 00:06:31.470
<v Speaker 3>It's like a workout room so I don't,</v>

244
00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:33.080
<v Speaker 3>I consider this more like,</v>

245
00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:35.660
<v Speaker 3>do you want to come do a really good audience at a workout room?</v>

246
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:36.621
<v Speaker 3>Well then here's,</v>

247
00:06:36.621 --> 00:06:38.070
<v Speaker 3>here's what you should do now to charge.</v>

248
00:06:38.071 --> 00:06:39.800
<v Speaker 3>No cover told him until the ice house,</v>

249
00:06:39.801 --> 00:06:40.910
<v Speaker 3>hey give me 50 bucks,</v>

251
00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:43.100
<v Speaker 3>charge no cover and there was no problem.</v>

252
00:06:43.101 --> 00:06:43.521
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

253
00:06:43.521 --> 00:06:44.354
<v Speaker 3>That's a great idea.</v>

254
00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:46.430
<v Speaker 3>Great idea.</v>

255
00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:47.660
<v Speaker 3>Because you know why I took my door,</v>

256
00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:49.820
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure.</v>

257
00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:52.880
<v Speaker 3>I'm not in it for money and I'd keep it as low as possible.</v>

258
00:06:52.881 --> 00:06:55.400
<v Speaker 3>Anybody who asks for a copy and give it to him and I still get the rest of</v>

259
00:06:55.401 --> 00:06:55.810
<v Speaker 3>charity,</v>

260
00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:56.210
<v Speaker 3>not names,</v>

261
00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:57.260
<v Speaker 3>I don't want the responsibility.</v>

262
00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:00.290
<v Speaker 3>Somebody else is going to completely do the desk.</v>

263
00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:01.690
<v Speaker 3>A desk squash show there.</v>

264
00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:03.420
<v Speaker 3>It's very difficult.</v>

265
00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:06.290
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] you're not in it for money and then say you need a certain amount of</v>

266
00:07:06.291 --> 00:07:07.820
<v Speaker 3>money or you won't do it because it's,</v>

267
00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:08.750
<v Speaker 3>in my opinion,</v>

268
00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:09.170
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

269
00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:09.560
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

270
00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:11.150
<v Speaker 3>if I had to be asked,</v>

271
00:07:11.151 --> 00:07:11.540
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

272
00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:13.160
<v Speaker 3>every Friday you have work,</v>

273
00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:13.810
<v Speaker 3>you put them through it.</v>

274
00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:14.300
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

275
00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:15.680
<v Speaker 3>If you have to go here,</v>

276
00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:17.300
<v Speaker 3>you have to sit here and record,</v>

277
00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:18.153
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

278
00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:18.981
<v Speaker 3>and then,</v>

279
00:07:18.981 --> 00:07:20.070
<v Speaker 3>and then in DC,</v>

280
00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:23.300
<v Speaker 3>those podcasts usually go from like three to five hours a lot.</v>

281
00:07:23.301 --> 00:07:24.500
<v Speaker 3>The podcasts because some people don't.</v>

282
00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:25.071
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

283
00:07:25.071 --> 00:07:28.730
<v Speaker 3>those pockets [inaudible] to put it all in the hands of the Ice House,</v>

284
00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:31.680
<v Speaker 3>give the ice house to contact numbers for all the people that want to go.</v>

285
00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:32.480
<v Speaker 3>That's what I do.</v>

286
00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:33.001
<v Speaker 3>That's what I did.</v>

287
00:07:33.001 --> 00:07:33.834
<v Speaker 3>Have him pay it.</v>

288
00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:35.940
<v Speaker 3>That's what I do whenever I don't want to do it,</v>

289
00:07:35.941 --> 00:07:36.261
<v Speaker 3>I'll pay it.</v>

290
00:07:36.261 --> 00:07:37.630
<v Speaker 3>They pay their headline is 100 bucks.</v>

291
00:07:37.631 --> 00:07:38.510
<v Speaker 3>I was always helps people.</v>

292
00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:41.390
<v Speaker 3>He kind of was always a thing,</v>

293
00:07:41.391 --> 00:07:42.560
<v Speaker 3>a hundred bucks for headliners,</v>

294
00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:47.160
<v Speaker 3>except for those fucking money they have the on the staff and they have,</v>

295
00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:48.530
<v Speaker 3>you mean they have to.</v>

296
00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:49.430
<v Speaker 3>It's true.</v>

297
00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:52.100
<v Speaker 3>That place especially has got so much history behind it and the place had been</v>

298
00:07:52.101 --> 00:07:53.420
<v Speaker 3>around for 50 plus years.</v>

299
00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:54.440
<v Speaker 3>It's such a great place,</v>

300
00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:59.740
<v Speaker 3>but I think that we gotta be real considerate of of comics and the fact that</v>

301
00:07:59.991 --> 00:08:04.280
<v Speaker 3>comics have a legitimate gripe when it comes to worrying about someone making</v>

302
00:08:04.281 --> 00:08:04.521
<v Speaker 3>money.</v>

303
00:08:04.521 --> 00:08:04.671
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

304
00:08:04.671 --> 00:08:05.930
<v Speaker 3>it has to be explained,</v>

305
00:08:05.931 --> 00:08:06.764
<v Speaker 3>I think in a,</v>

306
00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:12.390
<v Speaker 3>in a thoughtful manner and not in this knee jerk sort of angry Yeley sorta</v>

307
00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:17.090
<v Speaker 3>shouty type away other people when you don't even come to me and talk to me.</v>

308
00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:18.410
<v Speaker 3>Well we're friends.</v>

309
00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:20.090
<v Speaker 3>Fuck you've Duncan Trussell oh,</v>

310
00:08:20.091 --> 00:08:20.811
<v Speaker 3>come on man.</v>

311
00:08:20.811 --> 00:08:21.640
<v Speaker 3>See this is,</v>

312
00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:23.130
<v Speaker 3>this is exactly what I'm talking about.</v>

313
00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:24.350
<v Speaker 3>This is fuck Dunkin.</v>

314
00:08:24.351 --> 00:08:25.310
<v Speaker 3>Stop Man,</v>

315
00:08:25.311 --> 00:08:25.850
<v Speaker 3>stop.</v>

316
00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:26.420
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

317
00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:30.440
<v Speaker 3>this is this kind of why because it tells you on a podcast because he's,</v>

318
00:08:30.441 --> 00:08:31.010
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>

319
00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:31.520
<v Speaker 3>I'm just done.</v>

320
00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:34.310
<v Speaker 3>I've done so much for that dude and he just pretty much attacked me.</v>

321
00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:34.731
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

322
00:08:34.731 --> 00:08:35.200
<v Speaker 3>fuck him.</v>

323
00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:35.600
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

324
00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:36.171
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>

325
00:08:36.171 --> 00:08:37.340
<v Speaker 3>If he had no point,</v>

326
00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:39.740
<v Speaker 3>no place to stabbed with a pencil,</v>

327
00:08:39.741 --> 00:08:40.450
<v Speaker 3>shit playing.</v>

328
00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:41.570
<v Speaker 3>If he had no point.</v>

329
00:08:41.571 --> 00:08:44.810
<v Speaker 3>If you have no place to to talk to you about this,</v>

330
00:08:44.811 --> 00:08:46.910
<v Speaker 3>there was no argument there then it would be,</v>

331
00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:48.110
<v Speaker 3>it would have no impact.</v>

332
00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:51.530
<v Speaker 3>The reason why it has somewhat of an impact is because it is an arguable</v>

333
00:08:51.531 --> 00:08:52.190
<v Speaker 3>position.</v>

334
00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:54.290
<v Speaker 3>Is there any ever a way to talk about it where someone says,</v>

335
00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:55.320
<v Speaker 3>let's just say this argument,</v>

336
00:08:55.321 --> 00:08:55.500
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

337
00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:55.741
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

338
00:08:55.741 --> 00:08:59.430
<v Speaker 3>so and so you should pay this much money to so and so and instead of going like,</v>

339
00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:01.290
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck I do this and this instead of going that go,</v>

340
00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:02.100
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

341
00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:03.000
<v Speaker 3>let me think about that.</v>

342
00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:06.240
<v Speaker 3>Why should I or shouldn't I pay this person this much money or less money or</v>

343
00:09:06.241 --> 00:09:08.220
<v Speaker 3>more money and just having a nice conversation about it.</v>

344
00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:09.060
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

345
00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:09.720
<v Speaker 3>Now I,</v>

346
00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:11.040
<v Speaker 3>that's why I don't think it's worth it to me.</v>

347
00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:14.640
<v Speaker 3>Well I think you took on a job then you didn't quite know how much time it was</v>

348
00:09:14.641 --> 00:09:15.160
<v Speaker 3>going to take.</v>

349
00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:16.500
<v Speaker 3>I do take on stage.</v>

350
00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:23.490
<v Speaker 3>How do you want to call the people and schedule The times and have them come in?</v>

351
00:09:23.491 --> 00:09:28.491
<v Speaker 3>It is how many $15 I went from going to doing open mikes with a lot of these</v>

352
00:09:28.951 --> 00:09:32.940
<v Speaker 3>people that I have on these shows or just going to like different clubs and</v>

353
00:09:32.941 --> 00:09:36.540
<v Speaker 3>doing stage time and never doing real shows with these people.</v>

354
00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:36.781
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

355
00:09:36.781 --> 00:09:37.230
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

356
00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:40.500
<v Speaker 3>so when I decided to take on this crazy shit,</v>

357
00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:41.191
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't more like,</v>

358
00:09:41.191 --> 00:09:41.820
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

359
00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:43.950
<v Speaker 3>I got this access to this room.</v>

360
00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:47.490
<v Speaker 3>I can make a show and we can all together and we could have a show once a week.</v>

361
00:09:47.491 --> 00:09:48.270
<v Speaker 3>It'd be cool.</v>

362
00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:50.820
<v Speaker 3>And so you wouldn't think of it as a financial decision?</v>

363
00:09:50.821 --> 00:09:52.020
<v Speaker 3>Never financial fun.</v>

364
00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:52.883
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

365
00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:53.820
<v Speaker 3>One of the,</v>

366
00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:56.770
<v Speaker 3>one of the things we were talking about that conversation with magical and you</v>

367
00:09:56.771 --> 00:09:57.780
<v Speaker 3>and they're at the ice house though,</v>

368
00:09:57.810 --> 00:10:00.330
<v Speaker 3>those nights where like one of the things we were all saying is like,</v>

369
00:10:00.331 --> 00:10:01.440
<v Speaker 3>and we'll just take the money,</v>

370
00:10:01.890 --> 00:10:02.760
<v Speaker 3>not not them,</v>

371
00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:03.623
<v Speaker 3>we will,</v>

372
00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:04.673
<v Speaker 3>it will be us,</v>

373
00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:05.340
<v Speaker 3>but how much,</v>

374
00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:08.820
<v Speaker 3>how many texts did you have to sell to get $150 at 15 bucks apiece?</v>

375
00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:09.840
<v Speaker 3>Average average.</v>

376
00:10:09.841 --> 00:10:12.960
<v Speaker 3>I think that thing holds 75 or something like that and sometimes they stuffing</v>

377
00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:15.190
<v Speaker 3>10 so 10 people and you only get,</v>

378
00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:16.350
<v Speaker 3>you'll take taxes out of that.</v>

379
00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:17.550
<v Speaker 3>So you only get 60% of that.</v>

380
00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:18.690
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>

381
00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:21.780
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to think how many tickets you would have to sell to go over that 150</v>

382
00:10:21.781 --> 00:10:24.030
<v Speaker 3>mark that you normally,</v>

383
00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:24.930
<v Speaker 3>I have no idea.</v>

384
00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:25.441
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

385
00:10:25.441 --> 00:10:26.790
<v Speaker 3>I don't get 100% of the door.</v>

386
00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:27.750
<v Speaker 3>You got 60% of the door.</v>

387
00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:28.860
<v Speaker 3>I think so something like that.</v>

388
00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:32.750
<v Speaker 3>Do I know what to do about any of this shit anyway because I think I'm literally</v>

389
00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:33.700
<v Speaker 3>don't want to talk about,</v>

390
00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:37.560
<v Speaker 3>I made a mistake as well and I just handed it over to you cause the first couple</v>

391
00:10:37.561 --> 00:10:38.660
<v Speaker 3>of shows when he's getting half of that.</v>

392
00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:40.950
<v Speaker 3>But when I just handed it over to you,</v>

393
00:10:40.951 --> 00:10:44.700
<v Speaker 3>I should have said let's sit down and figure out where this should go and that</v>

394
00:10:44.701 --> 00:10:47.070
<v Speaker 3>we should have the rent paid for and the insurance</v>

395
00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:49.533
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

396
00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:49.830
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

397
00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:51.000
<v Speaker 3>to me it's not even worth it to me.</v>

398
00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:51.470
<v Speaker 3>I'll go,</v>

399
00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:51.900
<v Speaker 3>I'll go.</v>

400
00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:53.550
<v Speaker 3>I'll go somewhere else for once a week.</v>

401
00:10:53.551 --> 00:10:56.400
<v Speaker 3>And do comedy somewhere else and enjoying myself and not get paid for it and</v>

402
00:10:56.401 --> 00:10:58.200
<v Speaker 3>just have fun and not dead.</v>

403
00:10:58.201 --> 00:10:59.220
<v Speaker 3>Last thing I do is like,</v>

404
00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:01.170
<v Speaker 3>thank you so much for letting me have this stage time.</v>

405
00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:02.430
<v Speaker 3>Fucking you should pay me.</v>

406
00:11:02.431 --> 00:11:03.740
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck I might talk about it.</v>

407
00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:03.880
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

408
00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:04.070
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

409
00:11:04.070 --> 00:11:05.580
<v Speaker 3>That's not the way people are saying it.</v>

410
00:11:05.590 --> 00:11:09.180
<v Speaker 3>Then assign one of those guys comedians</v>

420
00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:28.141
<v Speaker 3>Not Exactly.</v>

421
00:11:28.141 --> 00:11:29.010
<v Speaker 3>What does that mean?</v>

422
00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:31.940
<v Speaker 3>They're saying a thing that I liked about something to do.</v>

425
00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:36.480
<v Speaker 3>There's a patio.</v>

426
00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:38.670
<v Speaker 3>There's a path with least resistance out there.</v>

427
00:11:38.671 --> 00:11:41.760
<v Speaker 3>I know it's kind of not bringing it up on a podcast and getting into it so</v>

428
00:11:41.761 --> 00:11:43.650
<v Speaker 3>everyone knows about this and thanks a lot guys.</v>

429
00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:45.170
<v Speaker 3>What are you talking about,</v>

430
00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:45.750
<v Speaker 3>Ryan?</v>

431
00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:47.100
<v Speaker 3>What are you talking about man?</v>

432
00:11:47.101 --> 00:11:50.010
<v Speaker 3>You make it impossible to talk to you about anything when you react this way,</v>

433
00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:52.440
<v Speaker 3>turn this into some crazy situation that it's not,</v>

434
00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:53.221
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

435
00:11:53.221 --> 00:11:53.650
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

436
00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:54.071
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>

437
00:11:54.071 --> 00:11:56.410
<v Speaker 3>I can understand you don't want it to book a comedy show,</v>

438
00:11:56.411 --> 00:12:00.190
<v Speaker 3>I can understand that being a tremendous time consuming thing.</v>

439
00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:01.811
<v Speaker 3>Well listen,</v>

440
00:12:01.811 --> 00:12:06.010
<v Speaker 3>let's all talk about this and figure out a way where we can have a show that the</v>

441
00:12:06.011 --> 00:12:08.410
<v Speaker 3>ice house books let's they're professionals.</v>

442
00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:09.483
<v Speaker 3>That's what they do.</v>

443
00:12:09.610 --> 00:12:12.570
<v Speaker 3>What am I doing is I'm married to an ice house chronicles and uh,</v>

444
00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:14.170
<v Speaker 3>I will make it just,</v>

445
00:12:14.171 --> 00:12:15.004
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

446
00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:15.873
<v Speaker 3>some other thing.</v>

447
00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:19.620
<v Speaker 3>I'll make it just like a green room while somebody else can do the room and I'll</v>

448
00:12:19.621 --> 00:12:20.800
<v Speaker 3>have nothing to do with that room.</v>

449
00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:21.260
<v Speaker 3>So Brian,</v>

450
00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:21.520
<v Speaker 3>Brian,</v>

451
00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:22.240
<v Speaker 3>just so you know,</v>

452
00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:25.150
<v Speaker 3>this reaction we're getting from you is the normal reaction we get from you when</v>

453
00:12:25.151 --> 00:12:25.900
<v Speaker 3>he brings something up.</v>

454
00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:28.260
<v Speaker 3>So does that make it more likely for us to bring things up to you?</v>

455
00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:29.710
<v Speaker 3>Are less likely to be open and honest?</v>

456
00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:30.490
<v Speaker 3>I tell you why.</v>

457
00:12:30.490 --> 00:12:31.360
<v Speaker 3>Because honestly,</v>

458
00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:35.470
<v Speaker 3>I am so fucking busy that I don't even need to deal with any of this.</v>

459
00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:36.340
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

460
00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:38.320
<v Speaker 3>I would rather just do this podcast,</v>

461
00:12:38.321 --> 00:12:39.154
<v Speaker 3>be happy,</v>

462
00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:40.630
<v Speaker 3>do everyone else's podcast,</v>

463
00:12:40.631 --> 00:12:44.770
<v Speaker 3>be happy and not have something that's such a big deal of that I thought was</v>

464
00:12:44.771 --> 00:12:47.380
<v Speaker 3>just helping friends out to you got a good point.</v>

465
00:12:47.410 --> 00:12:48.700
<v Speaker 3>I think you've got a good point in that.</v>

466
00:12:48.701 --> 00:12:53.590
<v Speaker 3>I think it is a lot more responsibility and a little extra thing that you have</v>

467
00:12:53.591 --> 00:12:57.870
<v Speaker 3>to chew on every week and I think it can still be done and done through the ice</v>

468
00:12:57.871 --> 00:12:58.181
<v Speaker 3>house.</v>

469
00:12:58.181 --> 00:13:01.030
<v Speaker 3>This way the icehouse pays people and we'll,</v>

470
00:13:01.031 --> 00:13:05.560
<v Speaker 3>we'll set aside a chunk of it so you can get paid for running the icehouse</v>

471
00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:07.230
<v Speaker 3>chronicle tickets,</v>

472
00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:08.163
<v Speaker 3>plus pay the guy,</v>

473
00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:10.651
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>

474
00:13:10.651 --> 00:13:11.484
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

475
00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:15.700
<v Speaker 3>or I can just do the exact same thing I was doing and any comic that wants to</v>

476
00:13:15.701 --> 00:13:16.500
<v Speaker 3>get paid,</v>

477
00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:16.970
<v Speaker 3>we'll tell,</v>

478
00:13:16.970 --> 00:13:17.290
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

479
00:13:17.290 --> 00:13:18.550
<v Speaker 3>I'll give them my man.</v>

480
00:13:18.551 --> 00:13:20.230
<v Speaker 3>You can't ask people to ask for money.</v>

481
00:13:20.570 --> 00:13:22.060
<v Speaker 3>You know what all I do at the time,</v>

482
00:13:22.061 --> 00:13:22.331
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

483
00:13:22.331 --> 00:13:22.511
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

484
00:13:22.511 --> 00:13:23.230
<v Speaker 3>you want some cash?</v>

485
00:13:23.230 --> 00:13:23.681
<v Speaker 3>And then they go,</v>

486
00:13:23.681 --> 00:13:24.514
<v Speaker 3>no dude.</v>

487
00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:24.911
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

488
00:13:24.911 --> 00:13:25.540
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

489
00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:25.811
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

490
00:13:25.811 --> 00:13:26.471
<v Speaker 3>Well those people,</v>

491
00:13:26.471 --> 00:13:27.310
<v Speaker 3>how many times did that happen?</v>

492
00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:28.750
<v Speaker 3>A lot more than you would think.</v>

493
00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:29.603
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>

494
00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:32.270
<v Speaker 3>well get out of here.</v>

495
00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:35.261
<v Speaker 3>Don't worry about it.</v>

496
00:13:35.261 --> 00:13:37.420
<v Speaker 3>It's not stupid talking about it.</v>

497
00:13:37.421 --> 00:13:39.230
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to become one of those guys that doesn't pay people.</v>

498
00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:41.250
<v Speaker 3>I don't even feel like talking about it.</v>

499
00:13:41.251 --> 00:13:42.084
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know.</v>

500
00:13:42.210 --> 00:13:43.390
<v Speaker 3>That's why it's hard to bring up.</v>

501
00:13:43.391 --> 00:13:44.860
<v Speaker 3>That's why I say I'd like to get paid.</v>

502
00:13:44.861 --> 00:13:45.694
<v Speaker 3>It's a hard thing to break,</v>

503
00:13:45.890 --> 00:13:49.360
<v Speaker 3>but it isn't boring to me.</v>

504
00:13:49.361 --> 00:13:50.690
<v Speaker 3>Podcasts be entertaining.</v>

505
00:13:50.691 --> 00:13:51.011
<v Speaker 3>Not like,</v>

506
00:13:51.011 --> 00:13:51.161
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

507
00:13:51.161 --> 00:13:55.300
<v Speaker 3>let's bust open Brian and fucking see why he's thinking about financial shit.</v>

508
00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:56.260
<v Speaker 3>No one's trying to bust you.</v>

509
00:13:56.261 --> 00:13:56.620
<v Speaker 3>Open,</v>

510
00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:58.060
<v Speaker 3>open on a podcast with,</v>

511
00:13:58.061 --> 00:13:59.260
<v Speaker 3>we were at a fucking restaurant.</v>

512
00:13:59.261 --> 00:14:00.370
<v Speaker 3>We could talk about all this.</v>

513
00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:02.290
<v Speaker 3>I don't feel like doing wrap this on a podcast.</v>

514
00:14:02.291 --> 00:14:02.890
<v Speaker 3>Sorry,</v>

515
00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:05.350
<v Speaker 3>I bring stuff up through Paychex.</v>

516
00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:06.440
<v Speaker 3>Let's talk about,</v>

517
00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:07.630
<v Speaker 3>very understandable,</v>

518
00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:08.591
<v Speaker 3>very understandable,</v>

519
00:14:08.591 --> 00:14:08.891
<v Speaker 3>Brian,</v>

520
00:14:08.891 --> 00:14:09.340
<v Speaker 3>but you,</v>

521
00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:12.790
<v Speaker 3>do you understand that you get into this like really angry defensive position</v>

522
00:14:12.791 --> 00:14:14.320
<v Speaker 3>with people that aren't even attacking you?</v>

523
00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:16.133
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

524
00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:17.920
<v Speaker 3>Do you understand that you do that sometimes?</v>

525
00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:18.521
<v Speaker 3>Listen,</v>

526
00:14:18.521 --> 00:14:18.910
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

527
00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:20.230
<v Speaker 3>it's avoidable.</v>

528
00:14:20.231 --> 00:14:21.940
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes you can talk in a,</v>

529
00:14:21.941 --> 00:14:23.110
<v Speaker 3>in a rational tone.</v>

530
00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:23.550
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

531
00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:27.190
<v Speaker 3>and I've been guilty of it as well happened in her life.</v>

532
00:14:27.191 --> 00:14:31.180
<v Speaker 3>It's easily avoidable with like seven people right now.</v>

533
00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:32.590
<v Speaker 3>Some of it to needle though.</v>

534
00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:33.251
<v Speaker 3>Brian,</v>

535
00:14:33.251 --> 00:14:34.480
<v Speaker 3>what you're doing is a great thing.</v>

536
00:14:34.481 --> 00:14:36.700
<v Speaker 3>What are you doing with your podcast network for those guys?</v>

537
00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:42.280
<v Speaker 3>I'll drive out there just to do it and what you said about like Freddy Lockhart,</v>

538
00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:44.440
<v Speaker 3>like needing the network to get them on.</v>

539
00:14:44.441 --> 00:14:45.011
<v Speaker 3>That is true.</v>

540
00:14:45.011 --> 00:14:45.690
<v Speaker 3>It is all true.</v>

541
00:14:45.690 --> 00:14:46.481
<v Speaker 3>It should,</v>

542
00:14:46.481 --> 00:14:47.830
<v Speaker 3>they lead with you every time.</v>

543
00:14:47.831 --> 00:14:48.011
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

544
00:14:48.011 --> 00:14:48.221
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

545
00:14:48.221 --> 00:14:48.671
<v Speaker 3>just so you know,</v>

546
00:14:48.671 --> 00:14:49.660
<v Speaker 3>you do a lot of great things for me,</v>

547
00:14:49.661 --> 00:14:50.770
<v Speaker 3>but I like to bring up this one thing.</v>

548
00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:51.890
<v Speaker 3>If it's without help,</v>

549
00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:53.090
<v Speaker 3>if you don't,</v>

550
00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:58.120
<v Speaker 3>if you guys don't think that what I do helps comedy or comics does your reading</v>

551
00:14:58.670 --> 00:15:00.690
<v Speaker 3>as we just saw it as you must hate you,</v>

552
00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:01.533
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

553
00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:04.910
<v Speaker 3>If you think there's a better death squad idea,</v>

554
00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:08.150
<v Speaker 3>I will gladly change the name of desk quad to something just to make you happy.</v>

555
00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:10.660
<v Speaker 3>You should do whatever desk.</v>

556
00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:11.271
<v Speaker 3>What is you,</v>

557
00:15:11.271 --> 00:15:12.470
<v Speaker 3>you're a part of death squad.</v>

558
00:15:12.830 --> 00:15:13.191
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

559
00:15:13.191 --> 00:15:14.510
<v Speaker 3>all of our friends are part of desk.</v>

560
00:15:14.511 --> 00:15:16.360
<v Speaker 3>Why the fact that you and Duncan don't talk or no,</v>

561
00:15:16.361 --> 00:15:17.030
<v Speaker 3>it's disgusting.</v>

562
00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:18.560
<v Speaker 3>You know what that's called,</v>

563
00:15:18.561 --> 00:15:19.370
<v Speaker 3>trimming fat.</v>

564
00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:22.130
<v Speaker 3>He's done a few things in the past that I've let go and you know what,</v>

565
00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:23.001
<v Speaker 3>I don't need that guy.</v>

566
00:15:23.001 --> 00:15:25.340
<v Speaker 3>I've helped that dude so many times and you know,</v>

567
00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:26.870
<v Speaker 3>I mean been on his podcast once.</v>

568
00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:27.650
<v Speaker 3>Well the same thing.</v>

569
00:15:27.650 --> 00:15:28.940
<v Speaker 3>Dunkin is no perfect person,</v>

570
00:15:28.941 --> 00:15:29.990
<v Speaker 3>but I love that guy to death.</v>

571
00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:32.360
<v Speaker 3>I'm no perfect person either and neither of you.</v>

572
00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:36.220
<v Speaker 3>I think we can avoid these kinds of conversations in the future if we just,</v>

573
00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:37.920
<v Speaker 3>you just calm down a little bit man.</v>

574
00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:40.100
<v Speaker 3>And what I said about being,</v>

575
00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:42.870
<v Speaker 3>being in arguably you don't have to be a</v>

576
00:15:44.570 --> 00:15:45.590
<v Speaker 3>straight deal with people.</v>

577
00:15:45.591 --> 00:15:46.110
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to say,</v>

578
00:15:46.110 --> 00:15:48.470
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to give you all my profits and not so all the profits.</v>

579
00:15:48.471 --> 00:15:50.620
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying you just completely reasonable.</v>

580
00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:52.560
<v Speaker 3>Why are we talking about this on a podcast is,</v>

581
00:15:52.561 --> 00:15:53.690
<v Speaker 3>and that's what I'm talking about,</v>

582
00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:56.180
<v Speaker 3>talking about fucking farts and olive garden.</v>

583
00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:59.780
<v Speaker 3>We don't have to talk about only far it's an all barn barn.</v>

584
00:15:59.781 --> 00:16:00.770
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing wrong with it.</v>

585
00:16:00.771 --> 00:16:02.960
<v Speaker 3>This is a good conversation for all of us.</v>

586
00:16:02.961 --> 00:16:03.410
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

587
00:16:03.410 --> 00:16:07.100
<v Speaker 3>It's a good conversation for me to understand that sometimes you don't feel like</v>

588
00:16:07.101 --> 00:16:09.410
<v Speaker 3>you're getting enough credit for all the work you're doing for all those guys</v>

589
00:16:09.411 --> 00:16:11.500
<v Speaker 3>that are on your network and in,</v>

590
00:16:11.501 --> 00:16:11.841
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

591
00:16:11.841 --> 00:16:14.840
<v Speaker 3>in built this platform where a lot of people find you find people because of</v>

592
00:16:14.841 --> 00:16:15.491
<v Speaker 3>that platform.</v>

593
00:16:15.491 --> 00:16:18.440
<v Speaker 3>We built it and I've been very supportive of a Brian and I've been trying to</v>

594
00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:22.100
<v Speaker 3>help it and I talk about it all the time on this podcast and tell people to</v>

595
00:16:22.101 --> 00:16:25.160
<v Speaker 3>subscribe to it and I tell people to subscribe to it on Twitter and this the</v>

596
00:16:25.161 --> 00:16:25.970
<v Speaker 3>only way to get it,</v>

597
00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:27.920
<v Speaker 3>the icehouse chronicles just to go through dusk squad.</v>

598
00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:29.220
<v Speaker 3>No one's trying to stop.</v>

599
00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:31.130
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't mean everything you've ever done with it.</v>

600
00:16:31.131 --> 00:16:32.660
<v Speaker 3>It's completely the right way to go.</v>

601
00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:35.030
<v Speaker 3>You'd have to be able to bring up something in order to get better.</v>

602
00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:35.240
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

603
00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:38.260
<v Speaker 3>we know we're not trying to stop anything or just the,</v>

604
00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:39.173
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

605
00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:41.930
<v Speaker 3>the icehouse thing can all be worked out and I think it's,</v>

606
00:16:41.931 --> 00:16:45.980
<v Speaker 3>it's a huge burden on your back to financially when it comes to figuring out who</v>

607
00:16:45.981 --> 00:16:48.200
<v Speaker 3>gets paid and taking taxes and shit.</v>

608
00:16:48.201 --> 00:16:48.921
<v Speaker 3>It's just not worth,</v>

609
00:16:48.921 --> 00:16:49.521
<v Speaker 3>that's not worth it.</v>

610
00:16:49.521 --> 00:16:50.990
<v Speaker 3>I just wanted to do comedy.</v>

611
00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:52.011
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

612
00:16:52.011 --> 00:16:53.170
<v Speaker 3>we can still tell you what you bought.</v>

613
00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:54.470
<v Speaker 3>If you slap everybody 10 bucks,</v>

614
00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:56.420
<v Speaker 3>it would be great.</v>

615
00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:57.290
<v Speaker 3>You know what?</v>

616
00:16:57.290 --> 00:16:59.480
<v Speaker 3>I just need an employee to go and actually do that for me.</v>

617
00:16:59.510 --> 00:17:00.343
<v Speaker 3>Goodbye.</v>

623
00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:07.640
<v Speaker 3>That guy,</v>

<v Speaker 2>It didn't have to be an Brian needs to know that we all love him and he's doing</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Everybody knows that Tommy put into it.</v>

677
00:18:23.890 --> 00:18:24.723
<v Speaker 2>Brian,</v>

678
00:18:25.210 --> 00:18:26.043
<v Speaker 2>it's not bad.</v>

679
00:18:26.530 --> 00:18:26.891
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

680
00:18:26.891 --> 00:18:29.710
<v Speaker 2>So you wouldn't say I'm stealing from comments that we do.</v>

681
00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:31.240
<v Speaker 2>Brian,</v>

682
00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:34.370
<v Speaker 2>I've never said you're stealing from company Duncan.</v>

683
00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:39.460
<v Speaker 2>He was out of line and he was upset at you because he wasn't making an argument</v>

684
00:18:39.461 --> 00:18:43.510
<v Speaker 2>about south by southwest and he didn't feel that you should've been interjecting</v>

685
00:18:43.511 --> 00:18:44.620
<v Speaker 2>what you were saying when he is,</v>

686
00:18:44.621 --> 00:18:48.160
<v Speaker 2>our whole argument was about they offered him to come out there and not pay him.</v>

687
00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:51.820
<v Speaker 2>It's a silly emotional thing between two guys.</v>

688
00:18:51.821 --> 00:18:55.630
<v Speaker 2>They got dragged out in a public way that was unfortunate and unnecessary.</v>

689
00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:56.860
<v Speaker 2>He shouldn't have done that.</v>

690
00:18:57.340 --> 00:18:59.170
<v Speaker 2>You acted in a very,</v>

691
00:18:59.171 --> 00:18:59.561
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

692
00:18:59.561 --> 00:19:01.060
<v Speaker 2>angry and you know,</v>

693
00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:02.560
<v Speaker 2>fucking violent way.</v>

694
00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:03.990
<v Speaker 2>And I had to actually separate the two.</v>

695
00:19:04.010 --> 00:19:04.421
<v Speaker 2>You guys,</v>

696
00:19:04.421 --> 00:19:05.254
<v Speaker 2>I mean the whole thing.</v>

697
00:19:05.670 --> 00:19:08.620
<v Speaker 2>And now he's trying to leave the room and you wouldn't let me leave the room</v>

698
00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:09.550
<v Speaker 2>pushing towards him.</v>

699
00:19:09.551 --> 00:19:12.490
<v Speaker 2>You were pushing towards now I was screaming at him with my finger pointing</v>

700
00:19:12.491 --> 00:19:13.450
<v Speaker 2>towards this direction.</v>

701
00:19:13.451 --> 00:19:15.490
<v Speaker 2>We're moving towards him to the point where I had to stop you.</v>

702
00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:16.270
<v Speaker 2>What am I going to do?</v>

703
00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:17.620
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you're going to do anything.</v>

704
00:19:17.621 --> 00:19:18.790
<v Speaker 2>I didn't think you were going to do anything,</v>

705
00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.140
<v Speaker 2>but you were so mad.</v>

706
00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:21.093
<v Speaker 2>I was mad.</v>

707
00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:21.760
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

708
00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:22.630
<v Speaker 2>And that's why I say,</v>

709
00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:25.630
<v Speaker 2>why were you so mad in contrast with Ryan and just be like,</v>

710
00:19:25.631 --> 00:19:25.990
<v Speaker 2>Nah,</v>

711
00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:26.500
<v Speaker 2>you're wrong,</v>

712
00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:26.731
<v Speaker 2>Brian.</v>

713
00:19:26.731 --> 00:19:27.311
<v Speaker 2>You know we love you,</v>

714
00:19:27.311 --> 00:19:28.144
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

715
00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:28.860
<v Speaker 2>Do you know we love you?</v>

716
00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:29.320
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

717
00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:30.153
<v Speaker 2>I think Brian,</v>

<v Speaker 2>we really do appreciate the work you do.</v>

719
00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:33.550
<v Speaker 2>If we give you a lawsuit without you,</v>

720
00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:34.930
<v Speaker 2>if we give you a big hug right now,</v>

721
00:19:34.931 --> 00:19:35.764

<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

00:19:36.490 --> 00:19:36.761
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

724
00:19:36.761 --> 00:19:38.020
<v Speaker 2>He's going to feel way more uncomfortable.</v>

725
00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:39.220
<v Speaker 2>No big hugs.</v>

726
00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:39.620
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

727
00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:39.971
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

728
00:19:39.971 --> 00:19:40.804

729
00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:41.681
<v Speaker 2>Brian.</v>

731
00:19:41.981 --> 00:19:42.160
<v Speaker 2>Mark.</v>
