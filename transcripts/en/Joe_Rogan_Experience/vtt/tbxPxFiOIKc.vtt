00:00:13.481 --> 00:00:13.850
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

3
00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:20.550
<v Speaker 2>Hey everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me introduce you to everybody here </v>

4
00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:21.190
<v Speaker 2>because we've got a large group of </v>
<v Speaker 2>humans.</v>

5
00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:23.080
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have my good friend Dr.</v>

6
00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:25.210
<v Speaker 2>Mark Gordon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's been on the podcast before,</v>

7
00:00:25.211 --> 00:00:27.490
<v Speaker 2>brilliant endocrinologist slash all </v>
<v Speaker 2>around.</v>

8
00:00:27.491 --> 00:00:32.491
<v Speaker 2>Awesome dude and his friend and patient,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Matthew Gosney and Matthew and I'm right</v>

9
00:00:34.751 --> 00:00:36.310
<v Speaker 2>here to my left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have Jason Halls,</v>

10
00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:41.340
<v Speaker 2>a screenwriter for American sniper and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to get into a lot of things </v>

11
00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:41.910
<v Speaker 2>on this podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but one of the big ones that we're going</v>

12
00:00:41.911 --> 00:00:46.911
<v Speaker 2>to talk about is Dr Gordon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you've listened to the previous </v>

13
00:00:46.911 --> 00:00:48.120
<v Speaker 2>podcast that he and I did have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you haven't.</v>

14
00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:53.130
<v Speaker 2>It's excellent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go back and check it out if you're </v>

15
00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:53.130
<v Speaker 2>bored.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

16
00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:55.770
<v Speaker 2>but you're an expert in traumatic brain </v>
<v Speaker 2>injury and you contacted me about </v>

17
00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.031
<v Speaker 2>Matthew and you've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've done some amazing work on </v>

18
00:01:00.031 --> 00:01:01.190
<v Speaker 2>soldiers coming back from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

19
00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.230
<v Speaker 2>from Iraq and Afghanistan and also </v>
<v Speaker 2>athletes with ptsd and the issues that </v>

20
00:01:07.271 --> 00:01:08.470
<v Speaker 2>come out of ptsd.</v>

21
00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.310
<v Speaker 2>Not just psychological but traumatic </v>
<v Speaker 2>brain injury,</v>

22
00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.420
<v Speaker 2>which is something that we're dealing </v>
<v Speaker 2>with more with these series of wars.</v>

23
00:01:16.421 --> 00:01:21.421
<v Speaker 2>And we ever had before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of the advancements in medical </v>

24
00:01:21.421 --> 00:01:23.521
<v Speaker 2>science,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're able to keep people alive that </v>

25
00:01:23.521 --> 00:01:24.340
<v Speaker 2>may have died before and also they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>able to recognize what's going on,</v>

26
00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.520
<v Speaker 2>what shell shock is this term that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>used after World War Two and know would </v>

27
00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.650
<v Speaker 2>they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They changed it a little bit in Vietnam </v>

28
00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:38.311
<v Speaker 2>that they altered the name of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but essentially we're dealing with the </v>

29
00:01:38.311 --> 00:01:41.041
<v Speaker 2>same issues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're dealing with the trauma to both </v>

30
00:01:41.041 --> 00:01:44.910
<v Speaker 2>the mind and the consciousness that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening to people that experienced </v>

31
00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:45.910
<v Speaker 2>horrible things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see horrible things,</v>

32
00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.030
<v Speaker 2>but also experienced damage to their </v>
<v Speaker 2>actual brain itself.</v>

33
00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.310
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The point of a foundation is the </v>

34
00:01:55.041 --> 00:01:59.930
<v Speaker 3>distinction between what ptsd is versus </v>
<v Speaker 3>minimal or mild traumatic brain injury.</v>

35
00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.320
<v Speaker 3>Unfortunately about 410,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>vets were coming back with what's being </v>

36
00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.911
<v Speaker 3>late.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're being labeled as traumatic as </v>

37
00:02:09.911 --> 00:02:11.210
<v Speaker 3>ptsd when in fact they have a form of </v>
<v Speaker 3>traumatic brain injury.</v>

38
00:02:11.211 --> 00:02:16.211
<v Speaker 3>The distinction between the two is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychological one which has ptsd and a </v>

39
00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.000
<v Speaker 3>physical one which is traumatic brain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Under the psychological.</v>

40
00:02:20.001 --> 00:02:21.110
<v Speaker 3>You've witnessed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

41
00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:26.170
<v Speaker 3>horrible things out there in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>battlefield where you've seen your </v>

42
00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.111
<v Speaker 3>friends being gutted or ied,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blowing them up in being left without </v>

43
00:02:29.111 --> 00:02:31.020
<v Speaker 3>any limbs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then in the psychologic,</v>

44
00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:36.040
<v Speaker 3>in the physical one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you actually have the impact of the </v>

45
00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.070
<v Speaker 3>explosion or a penetrating wound like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>shot to the head or being bludgeoned and</v>

46
00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.400
<v Speaker 3>in football,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's believed that under the </v>

47
00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.191
<v Speaker 3>psychological one with the ptsd,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that reliving the event that </v>

48
00:02:48.291 --> 00:02:53.291
<v Speaker 3>precipitated is what causes you to </v>
<v Speaker 3>become depressed and anxious and so </v>

49
00:02:53.291 --> 00:02:53.291
<v Speaker 3>forth.</v>

50
00:02:53.291 --> 00:02:55.010
<v Speaker 3>Under the minimum or the mild traumatic </v>
<v Speaker 3>brain injury.</v>

51
00:02:55.011 --> 00:02:59.030
<v Speaker 3>It's the physical trauma to the brain </v>
<v Speaker 3>that leads to deficiencies of hormones,</v>

52
00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:04.050
<v Speaker 3>which is what my whole premise has been </v>
<v Speaker 3>for my treatment of traumatic brain </v>

53
00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.720
<v Speaker 3>injury.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what's being missed is there are guys</v>

54
00:03:07.721 --> 00:03:12.721
<v Speaker 3>that go out there in the field who have </v>
<v Speaker 3>already had issues of traumatic brain </v>

55
00:03:12.721 --> 00:03:17.011
<v Speaker 3>injury because they'd been fighting a </v>
<v Speaker 3>firing weapons which caused jolting </v>

56
00:03:17.011 --> 00:03:20.260
<v Speaker 3>action or they've been jumping off out </v>
<v Speaker 3>of planes and hitting the ground at 10,</v>

57
00:03:20.261 --> 00:03:21.490
<v Speaker 3>15,</v>
<v Speaker 3>20 miles an hour.</v>

58
00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.880
<v Speaker 3>These types of impacts are significant </v>
<v Speaker 3>amount of to make a traumatic brain </v>

59
00:03:27.101 --> 00:03:32.101
<v Speaker 3>injury and interrupt the way that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>brain controls our hormone balance in </v>

60
00:03:32.101 --> 00:03:33.760
<v Speaker 3>our body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is all fairly new,</v>

61
00:03:33.761 --> 00:03:38.761
<v Speaker 3>this understanding of these things like </v>
<v Speaker 3>jumping out of planes or even playing </v>

62
00:03:38.761 --> 00:03:40.120
<v Speaker 3>soccer and heading the ball.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Correct.</v>

63
00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.150
<v Speaker 3>That's what we're finding in in </v>
<v Speaker 3>football,</v>

64
00:03:43.151 --> 00:03:46.330
<v Speaker 3>you know by the time you get into the </v>
<v Speaker 3>national football league,</v>

65
00:03:46.331 --> 00:03:49.660
<v Speaker 3>you've already gone through peewee pop </v>
<v Speaker 3>warner in high school,</v>

66
00:03:49.661 --> 00:03:52.120
<v Speaker 3>junior high school and so forth and </v>
<v Speaker 3>college football,</v>

67
00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:57.450
<v Speaker 3>and by the time you get to the major </v>
<v Speaker 3>games you've already have the entire </v>

68
00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:02.101
<v Speaker 3>process of loss of functionality in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>brain and then you need just one more </v>

69
00:04:02.531 --> 00:04:03.970
<v Speaker 3>hit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one more,</v>

70
00:04:03.971 --> 00:04:08.971
<v Speaker 3>not even loss of consciousness to create</v>
<v Speaker 3>the scenario of inflammation in the </v>

71
00:04:08.971 --> 00:04:09.940
<v Speaker 3>brain that leads to hormone deficiency.</v>

72
00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:11.850
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the.</v>

73
00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.970
<v Speaker 3>The issue has always been thought of as </v>
<v Speaker 3>when you.</v>

74
00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:17.280
<v Speaker 3>When it comes to brain damage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

75
00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.280
<v Speaker 3>you always thought of people who have </v>
<v Speaker 3>been beaten up like boxers that have had</v>

76
00:04:21.281 --> 00:04:26.281
<v Speaker 3>long careers or football players who </v>
<v Speaker 3>have had long careers and they just </v>

77
00:04:26.281 --> 00:04:29.620
<v Speaker 3>stayed in too long,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we're finding that a lot of athletes</v>

78
00:04:29.621 --> 00:04:32.320
<v Speaker 3>like mark Henry's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his name was no,</v>

79
00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:34.240
<v Speaker 3>what was his name?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The young guy,</v>

80
00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:39.530
<v Speaker 3>Chris Henry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Chris at the young guy who fell off the </v>

81
00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:39.550
<v Speaker 3>back of a truck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did something really irrational.</v>

82
00:04:39.551 --> 00:04:42.220
<v Speaker 3>His girlfriend was driving away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>jumped on the back of her truck,</v>

83
00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.110
<v Speaker 3>fell off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>died,</v>

84
00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:45.910
<v Speaker 3>hit his head,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then when they examined his brain,</v>

85
00:04:45.911 --> 00:04:48.730
<v Speaker 3>like this guy has a brain of a 70 year </v>
<v Speaker 3>old Alzheimer's patient.</v>

86
00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:50.670
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's all just be.</v>

87
00:04:50.671 --> 00:04:52.150
<v Speaker 3>And he was 26,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe,</v>

88
00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:57.210
<v Speaker 3>26.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a mid twenties and just a career of </v>

89
00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.440
<v Speaker 3>playing in the NFL as well as well as </v>
<v Speaker 3>college football,</v>

90
00:04:59.560 --> 00:04:59.980
<v Speaker 3>high school.</v>

91
00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:04.980
<v Speaker 3>The whole deal that like you detailed </v>
<v Speaker 3>had left this guy with a significantly </v>

92
00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:08.971
<v Speaker 3>damaged brain before he was even 30 </v>
<v Speaker 3>years old and he was running around </v>

93
00:05:08.971 --> 00:05:10.060
<v Speaker 3>functioning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody had suspected this.</v>

94
00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:13.030
<v Speaker 3>He was behaving like a normal person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Correct.</v>

95
00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.060
<v Speaker 3>If you look at the suicides that have </v>
<v Speaker 3>been happening in football,</v>

96
00:05:16.061 --> 00:05:21.061
<v Speaker 3>when they're between the ages of 25 and </v>
<v Speaker 3>35 that committing suicide,</v>

97
00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:26.940
<v Speaker 3>looking at their brain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see that they're aging a lot more </v>

98
00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:30.690
<v Speaker 3>faster than normal person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and in fact a study that was performed </v>

99
00:05:30.731 --> 00:05:35.731
<v Speaker 3>by the nfl showed that there was an 18 </v>
<v Speaker 3>times faster occurrence of Alzheimer's </v>

100
00:05:35.731 --> 00:05:38.950
<v Speaker 3>disease in people who have had traumatic</v>
<v Speaker 3>brain injury playing in nfl.</v>

101
00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:44.460
<v Speaker 3>We've had boxers as patient.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Two Thousand and seven did a espn </v>

102
00:05:44.531 --> 00:05:48.300
<v Speaker 3>outside the line with a two football </v>
<v Speaker 3>players in a boxer,</v>

103
00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:49.120
<v Speaker 3>James,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tony,</v>

104
00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:53.110
<v Speaker 3>and we showed his hormone levels were </v>
<v Speaker 3>down low.</v>

105
00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:54.940
<v Speaker 3>The laboratory read them all as being </v>
<v Speaker 3>low.</v>

106
00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:59.940
<v Speaker 3>I didn't have to interpret it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The lab did so that verified the fact </v>

107
00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:03.260
<v Speaker 3>that they were really low and he had a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of difficulties with weight,</v>

108
00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:06.590
<v Speaker 3>with control and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And as the host of the show said,</v>

109
00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:11.860
<v Speaker 3>how can you be testosterone growth </v>
<v Speaker 3>hormone deficient and still be able to </v>

110
00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:11.860
<v Speaker 3>do that kind of functioning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

111
00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:13.130
<v Speaker 3>the personality takes over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

112
00:06:13.131 --> 00:06:18.131
<v Speaker 3>it's just the way that the person </v>
<v Speaker 3>projects their life hormones help to </v>

113
00:06:18.501 --> 00:06:20.150
<v Speaker 3>stabilize it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to make it available,</v>

114
00:06:20.151 --> 00:06:22.930
<v Speaker 3>and then you as an individual get to </v>
<v Speaker 3>decide what you do.</v>

115
00:06:22.931 --> 00:06:25.310
<v Speaker 3>And he was in the ring fighting as </v>
<v Speaker 3>though there was nothing wrong,</v>

116
00:06:25.311 --> 00:06:27.380
<v Speaker 3>but he had a lot of problems outside the</v>
<v Speaker 3>ring.</v>

117
00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:29.450
<v Speaker 4>So what you're saying essentially is </v>
<v Speaker 4>that is just his,</v>

118
00:06:29.451 --> 00:06:32.490
<v Speaker 4>his discipline and his will that kept </v>
<v Speaker 4>him fighting,</v>

119
00:06:32.491 --> 00:06:34.530
<v Speaker 4>but he was significantly depleted.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Correct.</v>

120
00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:39.630
<v Speaker 3>He was unbelievably depleted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then looking at a gentleman by the </v>

121
00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:41.830
<v Speaker 3>name of Brad legged,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who was the mariners and the patriots,</v>

122
00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:45.580
<v Speaker 3>his hormone levels were incredibly low </v>
<v Speaker 3>when he talks about how his,</v>

123
00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:51.010
<v Speaker 3>I'll use rejuvenation occurred where he </v>
<v Speaker 3>improved in mental functioning,</v>

124
00:06:51.011 --> 00:06:53.350
<v Speaker 3>physical functioning and physiological </v>
<v Speaker 3>functioning.</v>

125
00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:58.590
<v Speaker 3>When he had his hormones returned to </v>
<v Speaker 3>normal and pat harlow was on the show </v>

126
00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:01.920
<v Speaker 3>and they all talked about their </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience when from multiple head </v>

127
00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:05.131
<v Speaker 3>traumas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think pat said he had double digit </v>

128
00:07:05.131 --> 00:07:05.131
<v Speaker 3>head traumas and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

129
00:07:05.131 --> 00:07:07.540
<v Speaker 3>if we go back and start doing some of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the new technology,</v>

130
00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:12.960
<v Speaker 3>like a dtm awry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which has an MRI that looks at the </v>

131
00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:15.841
<v Speaker 3>connectivity of nerves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at a pet scanner spect scan that </v>

132
00:07:15.841 --> 00:07:19.351
<v Speaker 3>looks at the flow of blood through the </v>
<v Speaker 3>brain and you can find areas of deficit </v>

133
00:07:19.351 --> 00:07:21.550
<v Speaker 3>because they've been damaged and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>can't get them back.</v>

134
00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:26.920
<v Speaker 4>And Matthew,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how did you get in touch with Dr Gordon </v>

135
00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:28.880
<v Speaker 4>and had this whole process start?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll start with your shell.</v>

136
00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:34.030
<v Speaker 4>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when he was on here last time I was in </v>

137
00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:36.290
<v Speaker 4>the hospital for a suicide attempt and </v>
<v Speaker 4>was an avid listener.</v>

138
00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:39.290
<v Speaker 4>Was listening to that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was on here talking about it.</v>

139
00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:40.940
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was at my last.</v>

140
00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:45.910
<v Speaker 4>I had no other options essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you're a veteran explaining.</v>

141
00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:48.650
<v Speaker 4>Explain your history for the people </v>
<v Speaker 4>listening to this.</v>

142
00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:50.810
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>On the navy seal medic.</v>

143
00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:54.710
<v Speaker 4>I've been out since 2008.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I live up in Washington,</v>

144
00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:59.690
<v Speaker 4>got out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>started having all kinds of issues,</v>

145
00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:04.640
<v Speaker 4>just kind of down spiraled.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Went into the va finally and said,</v>

146
00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:08.210
<v Speaker 4>this is going on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Immediately they diagnosed me with PTSD,</v>

147
00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:13.070
<v Speaker 4>handed me about 10 medications and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>we did follow ups checkups can what kind</v>

148
00:08:13.071 --> 00:08:16.190
<v Speaker 4>of medications?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The SSRI antidepressants,</v>

149
00:08:16.191 --> 00:08:18.620
<v Speaker 4>antianxiety meds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have chronic pain,</v>

150
00:08:18.621 --> 00:08:23.330
<v Speaker 4>so they dosed me up on pain medications </v>
<v Speaker 4>to cotton things along those lines.</v>

151
00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:24.530
<v Speaker 4>Fentanyl,</v>
<v Speaker 4>morphine,</v>

152
00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:26.690
<v Speaker 4>oxycontin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was on all three at one point.</v>

153
00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:29.750
<v Speaker 4>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by the way,</v>

154
00:08:29.751 --> 00:08:30.650
<v Speaker 4>how high did you get</v>

155
00:08:32.430 --> 00:08:37.430
<v Speaker 5>the ground?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Totally feel bad for them or jealous did</v>

156
00:08:40.411 --> 00:08:40.920
<v Speaker 5>he share?</v>

157
00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:45.020
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>

158
00:08:45.021 --> 00:08:47.480
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was just having a lot of issues.</v>

159
00:08:47.481 --> 00:08:50.120
<v Speaker 4>I was really depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I started gaining weight.</v>

160
00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:54.230
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't get up out of bed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was married at the time,</v>

161
00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:59.100
<v Speaker 4>really struggling all that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then my wife left me because of what was</v>

162
00:08:59.101 --> 00:09:01.200
<v Speaker 4>going on and I just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

163
00:09:01.201 --> 00:09:06.201
<v Speaker 4>I literally had no hope because it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was thinking that I can't be fixed </v>

164
00:09:07.021 --> 00:09:12.021
<v Speaker 4>because they're giving me all these </v>
<v Speaker 4>things saying this is going to make you </v>

165
00:09:12.021 --> 00:09:12.021
<v Speaker 4>better,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is going to make you better.</v>

166
00:09:12.021 --> 00:09:14.310
<v Speaker 4>And my mind wasn't getting any better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

167
00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:19.350
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I decided it was better that I just </v>

168
00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:19.350
<v Speaker 4>wasn't here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And ended up in the hospital,</v>

169
00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:21.780
<v Speaker 4>was there for a week.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My wife actually brought me,</v>

170
00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:24.630
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my ipod and all my stuff.</v>

171
00:09:24.631 --> 00:09:27.870
<v Speaker 4>So I was able to listen because she knew</v>
<v Speaker 4>that I and listened to the show.</v>

172
00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:29.760
<v Speaker 4>And he was on here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it literally,</v>

173
00:09:29.761 --> 00:09:32.190
<v Speaker 4>the day I got out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I went on and I applied,</v>

174
00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:35.580
<v Speaker 4>got a grant,</v>
<v Speaker 4>had all my lab work done,</v>

175
00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:37.380
<v Speaker 4>got sent to him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

176
00:09:37.381 --> 00:09:42.381
<v Speaker 4>he sent me all my results back and so we</v>
<v Speaker 4>figured out kind of what kind of </v>

177
00:09:42.381 --> 00:09:45.000
<v Speaker 4>protocol I needed to do and then I flew </v>
<v Speaker 4>down here to talk to him and started,</v>

178
00:09:45.001 --> 00:09:46.060
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the trt.</v>

179
00:09:46.370 --> 00:09:48.890
<v Speaker 6>So what do you think,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

180
00:09:48.891 --> 00:09:51.770
<v Speaker 6>if you could,</v>
<v Speaker 6>do you have like a series of events that</v>

181
00:09:51.771 --> 00:09:55.460
<v Speaker 6>you can recall that caused your injuries</v>
<v Speaker 6>or is it just a,</v>

182
00:09:55.490 --> 00:09:59.000
<v Speaker 6>just the entire entirety of your career </v>
<v Speaker 6>in the military?</v>

183
00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:02.690
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was in two IED explosions to the face,</v>

184
00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:06.140
<v Speaker 4>so I have six bolts in my jaw.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I took shrapnel to the side of my face.</v>

185
00:10:06.141 --> 00:10:11.141
<v Speaker 4>I was shot in my leg.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just from all the damage of doing </v>

186
00:10:11.141 --> 00:10:11.690
<v Speaker 4>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not related to any mission,</v>

187
00:10:11.691 --> 00:10:13.910
<v Speaker 4>but I ended up having surgeries on my </v>
<v Speaker 4>shoulder,</v>

188
00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:17.210
<v Speaker 4>arthritis and all my joints I have back </v>
<v Speaker 4>issues.</v>

189
00:10:17.211 --> 00:10:22.211
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it just all kind of compounded into </v>

190
00:10:22.211 --> 00:10:22.211
<v Speaker 4>one of damage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then just,</v>

191
00:10:22.211 --> 00:10:23.480
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>shooting on fours all day,</v>

192
00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:26.180
<v Speaker 4>jumping out of things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>rolling around,</v>

193
00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:27.140
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even just,</v>

194
00:10:27.141 --> 00:10:28.560
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

195
00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:33.580
<v Speaker 4>just hand to hand combat when we're </v>
<v Speaker 4>practicing things you can get thrown on </v>

196
00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:34.090
<v Speaker 4>the ground and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

197
00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:36.830
<v Speaker 4>over time it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's essentially what it was,</v>

198
00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:38.600
<v Speaker 4>is just so much stuff happened over </v>
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

199
00:10:38.601 --> 00:10:40.190
<v Speaker 4>Then that just compounded.</v>

200
00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:45.640
<v Speaker 6>And did you feel this coming on slowly </v>
<v Speaker 6>or was it very quickly?</v>

201
00:10:45.641 --> 00:10:48.130
<v Speaker 6>Was it when you got home was when you </v>
<v Speaker 6>were over there?</v>

202
00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:53.280
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a hard thing to answer because </v>

203
00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:56.851
<v Speaker 4>for me it wasn't very noticeable other </v>
<v Speaker 4>than the fact that I just didn't feel </v>

204
00:10:56.851 --> 00:10:59.920
<v Speaker 4>good mentally.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wasn't there mentally.</v>

205
00:10:59.921 --> 00:11:04.921
<v Speaker 4>You learn to shut things off,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you become desensitized to the world </v>

206
00:11:04.921 --> 00:11:05.500
<v Speaker 4>around you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It as a soldier,</v>

207
00:11:05.590 --> 00:11:10.590
<v Speaker 4>it's a survival mechanism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so emotionally I was able to do </v>

208
00:11:10.590 --> 00:11:14.911
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to turn it off where everyone else </v>

209
00:11:14.911 --> 00:11:16.951
<v Speaker 4>around me could see something was wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wasn't acknowledging it because to me </v>

210
00:11:17.650 --> 00:11:19.790
<v Speaker 4>there wasn't anything wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

211
00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:21.490
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

212
00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:26.580
<v Speaker 4>I just thought the pain that I had,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was just going to be the way it </v>

213
00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:26.580
<v Speaker 4>was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was depressed with everything.</v>

214
00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:26.580
<v Speaker 4>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

215
00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:28.420
<v Speaker 4>that's just life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now I went and did this.</v>

216
00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:33.780
<v Speaker 4>Now I have to deal with that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you have this stubborn mentality </v>

217
00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:37.861
<v Speaker 4>because you put all these goals in front</v>
<v Speaker 4>of you and you've always accomplished </v>

218
00:11:37.861 --> 00:11:41.131
<v Speaker 4>them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so now here's something that they're </v>

219
00:11:41.131 --> 00:11:41.131
<v Speaker 4>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

220
00:11:41.131 --> 00:11:41.131
<v Speaker 4>you have this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

221
00:11:41.131 --> 00:11:41.850
<v Speaker 4>I can beat this too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but as you're,</v>

222
00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:42.950
<v Speaker 4>you keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're fine.</v>

223
00:11:42.951 --> 00:11:44.400
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not doing.</v>

224
00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:46.450
<v Speaker 4>I can't beat this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's going on here?</v>

225
00:11:46.570 --> 00:11:48.190
<v Speaker 4>So then you look at yourself when you </v>
<v Speaker 4>go,</v>

226
00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:49.330
<v Speaker 4>this is just me.</v>

227
00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:53.980
<v Speaker 6>And does it get to a point where it </v>
<v Speaker 6>seems like life is</v>

228
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:58.980
<v Speaker 4>so painful and there's so much </v>
<v Speaker 4>negativity involved in your day to day </v>

229
00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:02.760
<v Speaker 4>existence that it seems pointless and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you just want to shut it off and ended.</v>

230
00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:06.940
<v Speaker 4>Is that like what's the mindset before </v>
<v Speaker 4>you decided to try to take your life?</v>

231
00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:08.890
<v Speaker 4>That's exactly the mindset.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

232
00:12:08.950 --> 00:12:13.950
<v Speaker 4>for me the breaking point was I think </v>
<v Speaker 4>when my wife left because she didn't </v>

233
00:12:13.961 --> 00:12:18.961
<v Speaker 4>leave because she didn't love me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She left because she couldn't live with </v>

234
00:12:18.961 --> 00:12:22.471
<v Speaker 4>me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if this person that I love and who </v>

235
00:12:22.471 --> 00:12:22.471
<v Speaker 4>loves me back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he can't live with me,</v>

236
00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:27.570
<v Speaker 4>then what's the point in me being here </v>
<v Speaker 4>and if she's begging me to get better </v>

237
00:12:27.570 --> 00:12:29.230
<v Speaker 4>and I'm going to counseling,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going on all these medications,</v>

238
00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:34.380
<v Speaker 4>they're switching my medications up </v>
<v Speaker 4>every three months because the fucking </v>

239
00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:34.570
<v Speaker 4>not working and you're going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

240
00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:37.000
<v Speaker 4>I can't keep doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't keep going on meds.</v>

241
00:12:37.001 --> 00:12:39.160
<v Speaker 4>I can't keep being stoned out of my </v>
<v Speaker 4>mind,</v>

242
00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:41.670
<v Speaker 4>I guess you could say with all the pain </v>
<v Speaker 4>meds and just.</v>

243
00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:43.390
<v Speaker 4>I mean I didn't even feel like a human </v>
<v Speaker 4>being.</v>

244
00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:46.330
<v Speaker 4>There was this fog.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't have cognitive function.</v>

245
00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:48.160
<v Speaker 4>I could barely read.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm an avid reader,</v>

246
00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:50.260
<v Speaker 4>I mean 10 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>15 minutes.</v>

247
00:12:50.261 --> 00:12:51.220
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck this,</v>

248
00:12:51.221 --> 00:12:53.380
<v Speaker 4>I can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It just,</v>

249
00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:57.460
<v Speaker 4>even even sleeping and was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>alright,</v>

250
00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:00.430
<v Speaker 4>I guess I couldn't sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Struggled with that.</v>

251
00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:03.010
<v Speaker 4>So even sleep wasn't even giving me </v>
<v Speaker 4>comfort.</v>

252
00:13:03.370 --> 00:13:04.410
<v Speaker 4>And so it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

253
00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:07.720
<v Speaker 4>there was no point to be here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And were you in contact still with a lot</v>

254
00:13:07.721 --> 00:13:10.240
<v Speaker 4>of the guys you served with and did they</v>
<v Speaker 4>have similar issues?</v>

255
00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:15.540
<v Speaker 4>Some of them did,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some of them had different kinds of </v>

256
00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:15.540
<v Speaker 4>issues.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

257
00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:19.420
<v Speaker 4>I think there's a stigma that ptsd </v>
<v Speaker 4>causes us huge aggression.</v>

258
00:13:19.421 --> 00:13:20.230
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

259
00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:22.750
<v Speaker 4>anyone I discussed with a and I tell </v>
<v Speaker 4>them,</v>

260
00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:24.700
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have ptsd like,</v>

261
00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:29.730
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are you gonna you're worried you're </v>

262
00:13:29.730 --> 00:13:29.730
<v Speaker 4>going to fucking snap and kill </v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody.</v>

263
00:13:29.730 --> 00:13:29.730
<v Speaker 4>And I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

264
00:13:29.850 --> 00:13:32.050
<v Speaker 4>that's not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if that's as common as it's</v>

265
00:13:32.051 --> 00:13:37.051
<v Speaker 4>been made out to be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think there's just been some huge </v>

266
00:13:37.051 --> 00:13:37.051
<v Speaker 4>cases and it's come out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it definitely is an issue.</v>

267
00:13:37.051 --> 00:13:38.560
<v Speaker 4>But for me that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that wasn't the case.</v>

268
00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:44.430
<v Speaker 4>Excuse me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For me it was more just internalizing </v>

269
00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:44.430
<v Speaker 4>everything and shutting off and just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

270
00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:46.600
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

271
00:13:46.601 --> 00:13:50.080
<v Speaker 4>having the ability.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was telling Dr Gordon this yesterday,</v>

272
00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:51.460
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for like for my wife,</v>

273
00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:56.520
<v Speaker 4>she didn't know what Matthew,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she was getting each morning and there </v>

274
00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:57.640
<v Speaker 4>was the matthew who was loving could </v>
<v Speaker 4>listen or whatever,</v>

275
00:13:57.641 --> 00:14:02.641
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the one she married or she was in get </v>

276
00:14:02.641 --> 00:14:04.771
<v Speaker 4>the math,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could rip your soul out and eat it </v>

277
00:14:04.771 --> 00:14:04.771
<v Speaker 4>right in front of her.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And she didn't know.</v>

278
00:14:04.771 --> 00:14:05.260
<v Speaker 4>And I was never,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I never hurt her,</v>

279
00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:07.810
<v Speaker 4>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's definitely,</v>

280
00:14:07.811 --> 00:14:09.940
<v Speaker 4>when you shut off emotions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

281
00:14:10.030 --> 00:14:12.970
<v Speaker 4>there's a fierceness to that and it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>scary,</v>

282
00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:14.170
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she would tell me,</v>

283
00:14:14.171 --> 00:14:14.620
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your,</v>

284
00:14:15.370 --> 00:14:18.790
<v Speaker 4>your face scares me and I wouldn't hurt </v>
<v Speaker 4>her,</v>

285
00:14:18.791 --> 00:14:20.860
<v Speaker 4>but there it's a protection thing for </v>
<v Speaker 4>me.</v>

286
00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:22.130
<v Speaker 4>And you just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

287
00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:25.180
<v Speaker 4>you just learn.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So a protection thing,</v>

288
00:14:25.181 --> 00:14:26.380
<v Speaker 4>meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like your aggression,</v>

289
00:14:26.381 --> 00:14:28.090
<v Speaker 4>it was almost like to shut other people </v>
<v Speaker 4>out.</v>

290
00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:29.560
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

291
00:14:29.561 --> 00:14:31.270
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's multiple things to that.</v>

292
00:14:31.271 --> 00:14:32.350
<v Speaker 4>One,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't want to deal with it.</v>

293
00:14:32.351 --> 00:14:34.240
<v Speaker 4>And two,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I could shut them out,</v>

294
00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:37.390
<v Speaker 4>then um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then I didn't have to acknowledge that I</v>

295
00:14:37.391 --> 00:14:40.060
<v Speaker 4>was interactions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just don't want to interact.</v>

296
00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:42.760
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to talk to you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't even want to look at you just go</v>

297
00:14:42.761 --> 00:14:45.670
<v Speaker 4>away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And because you could see the pain,</v>

298
00:14:45.671 --> 00:14:47.920
<v Speaker 4>every time they look at you and it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>just a reminder,</v>

299
00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:49.450
<v Speaker 4>it's that case of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

300
00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:55.180
<v Speaker 4>you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>can't get better until you acknowledge </v>

301
00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:55.180
<v Speaker 4>it's wrong.</v>

302
00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:55.180
<v Speaker 3>So you just don't acknowledge it in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>same bucket.</v>

303
00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:58.330
<v Speaker 3>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you hear about Dr Gordon on the podcast.</v>

304
00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:03.340
<v Speaker 3>You hear about this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the treatment for traumatic brain </v>

305
00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:05.771
<v Speaker 3>injury,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you hear about hormone replacement </v>

306
00:15:05.771 --> 00:15:06.440
<v Speaker 3>and the damage to the pituitary gland </v>
<v Speaker 3>that happens during these impacts.</v>

307
00:15:06.690 --> 00:15:11.690
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get together and you start hormone </v>

308
00:15:11.690 --> 00:15:12.440
<v Speaker 3>replacement therapy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then what are the results?</v>

309
00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:15.500
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it sounds like an infomercial does.</v>

310
00:15:15.730 --> 00:15:20.730
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it almost sounds almost sounds like a </v>

311
00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:20.730
<v Speaker 3>miracle cure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but at this point,</v>

312
00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:20.850
<v Speaker 3>for me it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

313
00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:26.290
<v Speaker 3>within 10 days,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the biggest thing for me was my </v>

314
00:15:26.290 --> 00:15:27.560
<v Speaker 3>cognitive function.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Within 10 days the fog was lifted.</v>

315
00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:29.720
<v Speaker 3>I could think clearly I could do things </v>
<v Speaker 3>again.</v>

316
00:15:30.190 --> 00:15:35.190
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and even physically within those first </v>

317
00:15:35.190 --> 00:15:35.190
<v Speaker 3>10 days,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was able to get out of bed,</v>

318
00:15:35.190 --> 00:15:35.720
<v Speaker 3>less pain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

319
00:15:35.721 --> 00:15:37.510
<v Speaker 3>I could move.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

320
00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:43.060
<v Speaker 3>and then within like six weeks I started</v>
<v Speaker 3>feeling like matthew started feeling </v>

321
00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:43.430
<v Speaker 3>like me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

322
00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:45.270
<v Speaker 3>I can go to the gym today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

323
00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:46.400
<v Speaker 3>and I can go do this today.</v>

324
00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:49.010
<v Speaker 3>I can read today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can interact today.</v>

325
00:15:49.250 --> 00:15:49.980
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

326
00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:56.200
<v Speaker 3>it's so hard to describe because you got</v>
<v Speaker 3>so used to how it felt that once it </v>

327
00:15:56.811 --> 00:15:58.010
<v Speaker 3>starts changing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

328
00:15:58.070 --> 00:15:59.330
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is unreal.</v>

329
00:15:59.390 --> 00:16:00.650
<v Speaker 3>This is happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this,</v>

330
00:16:00.651 --> 00:16:02.630
<v Speaker 3>I'm a different person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my real,</v>

331
00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:05.270
<v Speaker 3>I'm the real me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a different person than you know,</v>

332
00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:07.750
<v Speaker 3>or had been the last couple of years and</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's,</v>

333
00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:12.780
<v Speaker 3>it's almost an adjustment because now </v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got to go back and try to just </v>

334
00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:13.850
<v Speaker 3>heal all the damage that you did around </v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

335
00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:14.910
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

336
00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:20.110
<v Speaker 3>so just replacing your hormones had that</v>
<v Speaker 3>significant an effect on your wellbeing,</v>

337
00:16:21.290 --> 00:16:23.450
<v Speaker 3>how you interacted with people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She cope,</v>

338
00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:25.460
<v Speaker 3>changed everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's amazing.</v>

339
00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:27.370
<v Speaker 3>So what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what exactly did you.</v>

340
00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:28.190
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what'd you put them on?</v>

341
00:16:28.191 --> 00:16:29.320
<v Speaker 3>Tell me what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

342
00:16:29.330 --> 00:16:34.330
<v Speaker 3>how did it start as a medical issue of </v>
<v Speaker 3>talk about that now he's given me the </v>

343
00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:34.330
<v Speaker 3>green light.</v>

344
00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:36.650
<v Speaker 3>He gave me the green light for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

345
00:16:36.651 --> 00:16:41.651
<v Speaker 3>we ran through a 28 point hormonal </v>
<v Speaker 3>assessment and that 28 hormones </v>

346
00:16:41.651 --> 00:16:44.750
<v Speaker 3>assessment looks at brain regulation of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the peripheral hormones,</v>

347
00:16:44.751 --> 00:16:49.751
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in order to make testosterone signal </v>

348
00:16:49.751 --> 00:16:50.630
<v Speaker 3>comes from the pituitary and tells your </v>
<v Speaker 3>testicles or a woman the ovaries to make</v>

349
00:16:50.631 --> 00:16:52.760
<v Speaker 3>Gastrin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stoss drone and then whatever.</v>

350
00:16:53.390 --> 00:16:58.390
<v Speaker 3>And in looking at his pattern,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had a very deep deficiency of the </v>

351
00:16:58.390 --> 00:17:00.350
<v Speaker 3>regulatory mechanism for production of </v>
<v Speaker 3>testosterone.</v>

352
00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:05.060
<v Speaker 3>But testosterone is only one of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>multitude of hormones that we focus on.</v>

353
00:17:05.061 --> 00:17:07.910
<v Speaker 3>There's Dht,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dihydrotestosterone is Dah,</v>

354
00:17:07.911 --> 00:17:12.380
<v Speaker 3>da Di dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what we're finding,</v>

355
00:17:12.381 --> 00:17:15.920
<v Speaker 3>you said we think of hormones as gender </v>
<v Speaker 3>or sex hormones.</v>

356
00:17:15.921 --> 00:17:18.650
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sex aspect of it as baby 30 slash 40</v>

357
00:17:18.651 --> 00:17:19.550
<v Speaker 3>percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The roots,</v>

358
00:17:19.730 --> 00:17:24.110
<v Speaker 3>the remainder is on repair and </v>
<v Speaker 3>maintenance of our body.</v>

359
00:17:24.170 --> 00:17:26.460
<v Speaker 3>One of the greatest things about </v>
<v Speaker 3>testosterone's,</v>

360
00:17:26.490 --> 00:17:27.410
<v Speaker 3>anti inflammatory.</v>

361
00:17:27.410 --> 00:17:29.600
<v Speaker 3>What happened to your joint pains in </v>
<v Speaker 3>your back?</v>

362
00:17:29.601 --> 00:17:33.560
<v Speaker 3>Pains on testosterone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So reduced by half of that first week.</v>

363
00:17:33.690 --> 00:17:35.870
<v Speaker 3>That's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is in the literature,</v>

364
00:17:35.871 --> 00:17:40.871
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I won't get too technical because I </v>

365
00:17:40.871 --> 00:17:43.301
<v Speaker 3>won't understand it myself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the issue is that the testosterone </v>

366
00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:48.820
<v Speaker 3>growth hormone like estrodial </v>
<v Speaker 3>progesterone all regulate inflammatory </v>

367
00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:50.220
<v Speaker 3>chemistry in our body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our immune system.</v>

368
00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:55.320
<v Speaker 3>And we've also found in the past seven </v>
<v Speaker 3>to 10 years that the brain makes its own</v>

369
00:17:55.321 --> 00:17:57.990
<v Speaker 3>hormones and its own hormones being </v>
<v Speaker 3>testosterone,</v>

370
00:17:57.991 --> 00:18:00.750
<v Speaker 3>dihydrotestosterone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>estrogen and so forth in the brain.</v>

371
00:18:01.290 --> 00:18:03.990
<v Speaker 3>And what they do is they regulate the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ability of the nerves.</v>

372
00:18:03.991 --> 00:18:05.890
<v Speaker 3>And I just gave a lecture that we </v>
<v Speaker 3>called,</v>

373
00:18:05.891 --> 00:18:10.891
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the non permissive environment which </v>

374
00:18:10.891 --> 00:18:11.520
<v Speaker 3>talks about when you have head trauma </v>
<v Speaker 3>neurotrauma,</v>

375
00:18:11.550 --> 00:18:16.550
<v Speaker 3>where you've been hit or explosion and </v>
<v Speaker 3>so forth were areas of the brain shut </v>

376
00:18:16.550 --> 00:18:20.161
<v Speaker 3>down in their ability to produce </v>
<v Speaker 3>hormones that regulate how you feel in </v>

377
00:18:20.161 --> 00:18:21.330
<v Speaker 3>your ability to have cognitive </v>
<v Speaker 3>functioning.</v>

378
00:18:21.330 --> 00:18:26.130
<v Speaker 3>So not only on testosterone replacement,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we use physiological dosing,</v>

379
00:18:26.131 --> 00:18:26.940
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

380
00:18:26.941 --> 00:18:31.590
<v Speaker 3>an average 25 to 35 year old male makes </v>
<v Speaker 3>about four to 10 milligrams a day.</v>

381
00:18:31.591 --> 00:18:34.620
<v Speaker 3>So we'll use 60 milligrams a week or 80 </v>
<v Speaker 3>milligrams a week,</v>

382
00:18:34.621 --> 00:18:39.621
<v Speaker 3>which is about a fourth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The amount that's used out there by </v>

383
00:18:39.621 --> 00:18:41.010
<v Speaker 3>traditional physicians who are replacing</v>
<v Speaker 3>testosterone.</v>

384
00:18:41.450 --> 00:18:44.310
<v Speaker 3>And he got phenomenal response without </v>
<v Speaker 3>any of the side effects.</v>

385
00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:49.700
<v Speaker 3>So the hormone replacement includes I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>anti inflammatory medication,</v>

386
00:18:50.011 --> 00:18:55.011
<v Speaker 3>which are all natural things like Pqq,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a form of Co q 10 that stopped </v>

387
00:18:55.011 --> 00:18:58.380
<v Speaker 3>the production of oxygen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They call it reactive oxygen species,</v>

388
00:18:58.381 --> 00:19:03.381
<v Speaker 3>which are oxidative chemistry oxidants.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that leads to death of cells.</v>

389
00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:06.990
<v Speaker 3>And there's an incredible amount of </v>
<v Speaker 3>literature that has been out for many,</v>

390
00:19:06.991 --> 00:19:11.991
<v Speaker 3>many years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And now it's getting more focused that </v>

391
00:19:11.991 --> 00:19:14.001
<v Speaker 3>in order for us to heal the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not only do we have to replace the </v>

392
00:19:14.001 --> 00:19:15.000
<v Speaker 3>hormones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we also have to protect it from this</v>

393
00:19:15.150 --> 00:19:17.310
<v Speaker 3>oxidative stress that the brain goes </v>
<v Speaker 3>through.</v>

394
00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:18.510
<v Speaker 3>Sounds like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

395
00:19:18.511 --> 00:19:23.511
<v Speaker 3>one of those trendy kind of statements,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's actually factual and there's </v>

396
00:19:23.511 --> 00:19:28.160
<v Speaker 3>just thousands of articles coming out </v>
<v Speaker 3>and how much we need glutathione or we </v>

397
00:19:28.171 --> 00:19:31.080
<v Speaker 3>need vitamin C dot Pqq,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Co q 10,</v>

398
00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:36.260
<v Speaker 3>all the things that take the free </v>
<v Speaker 3>radicals that are damaging the ability </v>

399
00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:38.380
<v Speaker 3>of the brain to regenerate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

400
00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:41.280
<v Speaker 3>in this lecture I just gave back in </v>
<v Speaker 3>1911,</v>

401
00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:46.310
<v Speaker 3>there was a guy by the name of Italo who</v>
<v Speaker 3>proved that we can generate our nerve </v>

402
00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:48.120
<v Speaker 3>cells or neurons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then 19,</v>

403
00:19:48.121 --> 00:19:53.121
<v Speaker 3>28,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then there's a guy in Canada who's </v>

404
00:19:53.121 --> 00:19:53.280
<v Speaker 3>like the guru and the ability to </v>
<v Speaker 3>regenerate the brain,</v>

405
00:19:53.281 --> 00:19:55.020
<v Speaker 3>but you have to have the right </v>
<v Speaker 3>environment.</v>

406
00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:57.750
<v Speaker 3>That right environment involves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

407
00:19:57.751 --> 00:20:02.751
<v Speaker 3>hormones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And also to help step up the system's </v>

408
00:20:02.751 --> 00:20:02.751
<v Speaker 3>ability to fight the oxidative stress.</v>

409
00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:06.350
<v Speaker 6>Why is this a sort it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if not ignored?</v>

410
00:20:06.351 --> 00:20:11.351
<v Speaker 6>Why is this not commonly known by a lot </v>
<v Speaker 6>of physicians or by a lot of people that</v>

411
00:20:11.391 --> 00:20:16.391
<v Speaker 6>talk about different neurochemicals that</v>
<v Speaker 6>change behavior because we think of </v>

412
00:20:16.391 --> 00:20:18.830
<v Speaker 6>dopamine and Serotonin.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Those are the two big ones,</v>

413
00:20:18.850 --> 00:20:23.850
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>When you think of Serotonin reuptake </v>

414
00:20:23.850 --> 00:20:25.841
<v Speaker 6>inhibitors,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when you think of antidepressants or </v>

415
00:20:25.841 --> 00:20:27.410
<v Speaker 6>when you think of people depleting that </v>
<v Speaker 6>with drugs,</v>

416
00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:30.040
<v Speaker 6>you're thinking of dopamine and </v>
<v Speaker 6>serotonin primarily.</v>

417
00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:32.150
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>very rarely does he do.</v>

418
00:20:32.170 --> 00:20:34.320
<v Speaker 6>The other ones get brought up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

419
00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:34.850
<v Speaker 6>I think</v>

420
00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:39.260
<v Speaker 3>unfortunately there's a financial </v>
<v Speaker 3>motivation to things.</v>

421
00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:46.000
<v Speaker 3>Matthew is on probably about 40 or 50 a </v>
<v Speaker 3>month of medication.</v>

422
00:20:48.970 --> 00:20:53.590
<v Speaker 3>One of the medications that he was on </v>
<v Speaker 3>was a couple hundred dollars a month and</v>

423
00:20:53.591 --> 00:20:58.591
<v Speaker 3>when you're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you said 15 total medications </v>

424
00:20:58.591 --> 00:21:02.250
<v Speaker 3>that when you add up the cost per month,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're talking about thousands of </v>

425
00:21:02.250 --> 00:21:06.330
<v Speaker 3>dollars a month,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it was history and keeping these </v>

426
00:21:06.330 --> 00:21:07.400
<v Speaker 3>people in medical industry as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As you know,</v>

427
00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:12.480
<v Speaker 3>the analogy that I make is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you remember back in Legionella </v>

428
00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:13.240
<v Speaker 3>Pneumophila in Philadelphia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was a lung infection,</v>

429
00:21:13.241 --> 00:21:17.920
<v Speaker 3>they went and gave these people know </v>
<v Speaker 3>thousand dollars drugs and it turned out</v>

430
00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:20.620
<v Speaker 3>that it was a fifty cent drug.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Erythromycin that treated it.</v>

431
00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:25.680
<v Speaker 3>We're looking for things that are so </v>
<v Speaker 3>brand new that we've ignored the very </v>

432
00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:30.421
<v Speaker 3>basic fundamentals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My martial arts instructor always said </v>

433
00:21:30.421 --> 00:21:30.520
<v Speaker 3>back to basics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>back to basics.</v>

434
00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:32.590
<v Speaker 3>Thank you young you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

435
00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:34.630
<v Speaker 6>so Jason Hall,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

436
00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:36.170
<v Speaker 6>you're a screenwriter,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>

437
00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:41.230
<v Speaker 6>you wrote American sniper,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which has been directed by Clint </v>

438
00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:41.230
<v Speaker 6>Eastwood,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is a,</v>

439
00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:42.070
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when is that coming out?</v>

440
00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:45.880
<v Speaker 6>It comes out at Christmas and it's about</v>
<v Speaker 6>Chris Kyle,</v>

441
00:21:46.090 --> 00:21:49.510
<v Speaker 6>a famous story of the book,</v>
<v Speaker 6>American sniper,</v>

442
00:21:49.511 --> 00:21:52.390
<v Speaker 6>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 6>best selling book and a tragedy where he</v>

443
00:21:52.391 --> 00:21:57.391
<v Speaker 6>was killed while he was working with </v>
<v Speaker 6>Ptsd sufferers and he was working with </v>

444
00:21:58.870 --> 00:22:02.260
<v Speaker 6>someone on the range who was suffering </v>
<v Speaker 6>and he wound up getting killed by them.</v>

445
00:22:02.550 --> 00:22:03.940
<v Speaker 6>How did you get involved in all this?</v>

446
00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:08.260
<v Speaker 7>I'll say first that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's a,</v>

447
00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:11.920
<v Speaker 7>that's a pending trial.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So we don't know if that guy had ptsd or</v>

448
00:22:11.930 --> 00:22:13.490
<v Speaker 7>you just had a screw loose or what it </v>
<v Speaker 7>was.</v>

449
00:22:13.970 --> 00:22:18.970
<v Speaker 7>He got approached by a woman who is </v>
<v Speaker 7>working to get that sucker right up to </v>

450
00:22:18.970 --> 00:22:20.330
<v Speaker 7>your mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Woman who was working in the parking lot</v>

451
00:22:20.331 --> 00:22:21.590
<v Speaker 7>at his kid's school said,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

452
00:22:21.591 --> 00:22:23.660
<v Speaker 7>my,</v>
<v Speaker 7>my kid is suffering and read your book,</v>

453
00:22:23.661 --> 00:22:24.920
<v Speaker 7>you serve.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Can you help him out?</v>

454
00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:28.010
<v Speaker 7>And that's about all he got.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And uh,</v>

455
00:22:28.050 --> 00:22:30.560
<v Speaker 7>he'd been helping out a lot of vets and </v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

456
00:22:30.860 --> 00:22:34.940
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>this guy had it informed and uh,</v>

457
00:22:35.030 --> 00:22:36.620
<v Speaker 7>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it was a tragic story.</v>

458
00:22:36.621 --> 00:22:37.900
<v Speaker 7>I met Chris,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

459
00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:43.000
<v Speaker 7>in 2010.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He got out in 2009 and I'd heard his </v>

460
00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:44.330
<v Speaker 7>story and I went down to Texas to meet </v>
<v Speaker 7>him.</v>

461
00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:45.590
<v Speaker 7>And,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

462
00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:48.890
<v Speaker 7>I'd never been to Texas before either </v>
<v Speaker 7>and had,</v>

463
00:22:49.010 --> 00:22:50.990
<v Speaker 7>hadn't met many navy seal snipers.</v>

464
00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:54.100
<v Speaker 7>Welcome to America to access and navy </v>
<v Speaker 7>seals altogether.</v>

465
00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:58.190
<v Speaker 7>I showed up and it's like 60 cops,</v>
<v Speaker 7>60 Texas cops,</v>

466
00:22:58.191 --> 00:23:01.780
<v Speaker 7>like half of all the Texas Rangers were </v>
<v Speaker 7>in the room and uh,</v>

467
00:23:01.850 --> 00:23:04.760
<v Speaker 7>and I don't drink.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So I wasn't real popular at first.</v>

468
00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:11.460
<v Speaker 7>The only way I could ingratiate myself </v>
<v Speaker 7>to them was one of them was picking on </v>

469
00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:15.530
<v Speaker 7>me and call me Hollywood liberal and </v>
<v Speaker 7>this and that and panty waist and,</v>

470
00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:20.590
<v Speaker 7>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so I throw them in a front headlock and </v>

471
00:23:20.590 --> 00:23:23.971
<v Speaker 7>I had jacked him up a little bit and </v>
<v Speaker 7>then Chris finally started talking to </v>

472
00:23:23.971 --> 00:23:27.191
<v Speaker 7>me.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It was like a choke him out a little </v>

473
00:23:27.191 --> 00:23:27.191
<v Speaker 7>bit.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

474
00:23:27.590 --> 00:23:28.070
<v Speaker 7>How did you get</v>

475
00:23:28.090 --> 00:23:28.970
<v Speaker 6>involved in this?</v>
<v Speaker 6>You,</v>

476
00:23:28.971 --> 00:23:30.460
<v Speaker 6>you read the story?</v>

477
00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:32.470
<v Speaker 7>I heard this story.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 7>confirmed,</v>
<v Speaker 7>kill at 2100 yards.</v>

<v Speaker 7>They're five guys on the planet who can </v>
<v Speaker 7>hit that shot in your boys.</v>

490
00:24:02.331 --> 00:24:03.770
<v Speaker 7>Not One of them.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I was like,</v>

491
00:24:03.771 --> 00:24:04.760
<v Speaker 7>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well look it up.</v>

492
00:24:05.330 --> 00:24:08.090
<v Speaker 7>So he calls back and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so uh,</v>

493
00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:09.860
<v Speaker 7>Chris,</v>
<v Speaker 7>cause one of the five.</v>

494
00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:12.150
<v Speaker 7>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

495
00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:14.640
<v Speaker 2>There's a vortex optics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some,</v>

496
00:24:14.641 --> 00:24:17.570
<v Speaker 2>a friend of mine that are provided me </v>
<v Speaker 2>with scopes and stuff for hunting.</v>

497
00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:19.970
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they actually got a call from someone in</v>

498
00:24:19.971 --> 00:24:24.971
<v Speaker 2>Afghanistan that was about to shoot </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody and they needed to know how to </v>

499
00:24:24.971 --> 00:24:29.471
<v Speaker 2>adjust their scope correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they were talking over a sat phone </v>

500
00:24:29.471 --> 00:24:33.610
<v Speaker 2>with the guys at vortex and giving them </v>
<v Speaker 2>the exact adjustments to make some </v>

501
00:24:33.610 --> 00:24:36.260
<v Speaker 2>fucking thousand yard shot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

502
00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:38.600
<v Speaker 2>thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Take care.</v>

503
00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:44.500
<v Speaker 2>It's great when you get to like real </v>
<v Speaker 2>long distance,</v>

504
00:24:44.510 --> 00:24:49.510
<v Speaker 2>like a thousand yards plus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean a lot of it is just calculations </v>

505
00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:51.320
<v Speaker 2>and mathematics and understanding scopes</v>
<v Speaker 2>and how much the bullet's gonna drop.</v>

506
00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:53.290
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And I think some of it is,</v>

507
00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:55.840
<v Speaker 7>some of it is instinct and I think some </v>
<v Speaker 7>of it is,</v>

508
00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:57.580
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he said God kissed the bullet.</v>

509
00:24:57.700 --> 00:24:58.050
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

510
00:24:59.030 --> 00:25:01.190
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Amen.</v>

511
00:25:01.250 --> 00:25:05.690
<v Speaker 2>God's mean fuck or not either way kissed</v>
<v Speaker 2>it or he blew on it.</v>

512
00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:07.670
<v Speaker 2>Whatever happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it worked.</v>

513
00:25:07.870 --> 00:25:11.390
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you get involved with these guys.</v>

514
00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:16.660
<v Speaker 2>You start in just becoming immersed in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world of the soldiers and their </v>

515
00:25:19.311 --> 00:25:22.730
<v Speaker 2>issues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And how did you get connected to Matthew</v>

516
00:25:22.790 --> 00:25:23.870
<v Speaker 2>and to Dr Gordon?</v>

517
00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:25.410
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>when I met Chris,</v>

518
00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:26.340
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I walked in,</v>

519
00:25:26.341 --> 00:25:28.110
<v Speaker 7>I met him,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I looked him in the eye and I was like,</v>

520
00:25:28.290 --> 00:25:29.870
<v Speaker 7>Oh shit,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

521
00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:32.820
<v Speaker 7>this guy's not home yet.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like you could see it in his eyes.</v>

522
00:25:32.821 --> 00:25:34.650
<v Speaker 7>There was something going on and it </v>
<v Speaker 7>felt,</v>

523
00:25:35.070 --> 00:25:38.730
<v Speaker 7>it felt like there was turmoil there.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It felt like he was still fighting and I</v>

524
00:25:38.731 --> 00:25:40.350
<v Speaker 7>called my wife and I was,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I was like,</v>

525
00:25:40.351 --> 00:25:45.351
<v Speaker 7>I don't know what I'm doing here.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't know what's going to go on with </v>

526
00:25:45.351 --> 00:25:45.351
<v Speaker 7>this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't know,</v>

527
00:25:45.351 --> 00:25:45.750
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>how he's going to work it out.</v>

528
00:25:45.751 --> 00:25:50.751
<v Speaker 7>But he's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he's got some stuff to work out and </v>

529
00:25:50.751 --> 00:25:50.751
<v Speaker 7>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

530
00:25:50.751 --> 00:25:51.450
<v Speaker 7>it was hard to look at.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It was hard to look into his eyes.</v>

531
00:25:52.020 --> 00:25:57.020
<v Speaker 7>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>thankfully his wife and his kid showed </v>

532
00:25:57.020 --> 00:25:59.421
<v Speaker 7>up the next day and I saw it change.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I saw for a minute the fog kind of </v>

533
00:25:59.421 --> 00:26:03.000
<v Speaker 7>lifted and I saw him light up,</v>
<v Speaker 7>his kids ran into his arms and,</v>

534
00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:05.910
<v Speaker 7>and I saw like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>here's what this guy was like before the</v>

535
00:26:05.911 --> 00:26:06.890
<v Speaker 7>war,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

536
00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:10.590
<v Speaker 7>this is the man who,</v>
<v Speaker 7>who was there before the war and,</v>

537
00:26:10.710 --> 00:26:13.290
<v Speaker 7>and here's maybe the man that he could </v>
<v Speaker 7>become again.</v>

538
00:26:13.910 --> 00:26:18.910
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many of these guys are just tough </v>

539
00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:21.170
<v Speaker 2>and they just deal with this new </v>
<v Speaker 2>reality.</v>

540
00:26:21.650 --> 00:26:26.650
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems like that is a big part of </v>

541
00:26:26.650 --> 00:26:26.650
<v Speaker 2>what's going on when you're saying the </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy wasn't back yet,</v>

542
00:26:26.650 --> 00:26:30.941
<v Speaker 2>but yet he was physically and he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>going through emotions and living his </v>

543
00:26:30.941 --> 00:26:34.040
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But all the shit that probably was going</v>

544
00:26:34.041 --> 00:26:36.500
<v Speaker 2>on in his brain and certainly going on </v>
<v Speaker 2>in his psyche,</v>

545
00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:42.100
<v Speaker 2>I think most come back that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's their first mentality is </v>

546
00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:42.100
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for me,</v>

547
00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:43.350
<v Speaker 2>you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to admit that</v>

548
00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:46.830
<v Speaker 4>I've beaten things worse than this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to keep going.</v>

549
00:26:46.890 --> 00:26:48.770
<v Speaker 4>Especially seals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

550
00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:51.110
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just to get through buds,</v>

551
00:26:51.190 --> 00:26:54.150
<v Speaker 4>just to get through any of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what I said.</v>

552
00:26:54.151 --> 00:26:55.770
<v Speaker 4>But any,</v>
<v Speaker 4>any challenge has been in front of me.</v>

553
00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:58.260
<v Speaker 4>It seems like I've completed it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so this,</v>

554
00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:03.320
<v Speaker 4>that's all it was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And once I finally realized that I </v>

555
00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:04.690
<v Speaker 4>couldn't how broken,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because then I,</v>

556
00:27:04.770 --> 00:27:07.470
<v Speaker 4>then I really felt broken because it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>never happened.</v>

557
00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:09.180
<v Speaker 4>There's no light at the end of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>tunnel.</v>

558
00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:11.970
<v Speaker 4>I just all dark.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It goes dark to the end of time.</v>

559
00:27:13.330 --> 00:27:16.350
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean the best parts about me were gone</v>

560
00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:22.040
<v Speaker 4>and had Chris Kyle,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if he received any treatment for ptsd </v>

561
00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:26.631
<v Speaker 4>other than the standard dose of </v>
<v Speaker 4>painkillers and Ssrs and what have you.</v>

562
00:27:27.410 --> 00:27:28.040
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

563
00:27:28.041 --> 00:27:30.140
<v Speaker 7>I think Chris,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think Chris dealt with it,</v>

564
00:27:30.590 --> 00:27:34.250
<v Speaker 7>doing some drinking and then he finally </v>
<v Speaker 7>kind of worked his way through it.</v>

565
00:27:34.251 --> 00:27:35.270
<v Speaker 7>Got a little,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

566
00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:40.300
<v Speaker 7>got back into church and,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and started actually helping these guys </v>

567
00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:43.160
<v Speaker 7>helping other veterans and he found </v>
<v Speaker 7>peace in that he found peace and helping</v>

568
00:27:43.161 --> 00:27:44.990
<v Speaker 7>other guys.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And you know,</v>

569
00:27:44.991 --> 00:27:49.991
<v Speaker 7>I can't speak to,</v>
<v Speaker 7>to what he felt when he laid his head </v>

570
00:27:49.991 --> 00:27:49.991
<v Speaker 7>down on the pillow at night.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But,</v>

571
00:27:49.991 --> 00:27:52.340
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he found some real solace in,</v>

572
00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:55.320
<v Speaker 7>in helping these vats and they'd,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

573
00:27:55.340 --> 00:28:00.340
<v Speaker 7>they'd bring them up and they'd go out </v>
<v Speaker 7>shooting at the range or go hunting and </v>

574
00:28:00.340 --> 00:28:00.650
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

575
00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:05.740
<v Speaker 7>and end up talking around the bed of a </v>
<v Speaker 7>pickup truck for four hours with a </v>

576
00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:09.221
<v Speaker 7>couple of beers in and then you,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you get a little bit of this comradery </v>

577
00:28:09.221 --> 00:28:10.460
<v Speaker 7>and,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and they don't feel so alone.</v>

578
00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:11.840
<v Speaker 7>We had a purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Again,</v>

579
00:28:12.590 --> 00:28:15.290
<v Speaker 7>you have a purpose while you're in,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you have a job</v>

580
00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:20.060
<v Speaker 4>now and it's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's ripped from you and there's not,</v>

581
00:28:20.150 --> 00:28:25.150
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no clear goal or mission in </v>

582
00:28:25.150 --> 00:28:25.280
<v Speaker 4>front of you anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you kind of searched for that.</v>

583
00:28:25.281 --> 00:28:27.980
<v Speaker 4>Like for me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I kind of was trying to figure out what,</v>

584
00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:33.160
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck am I going to do with </v>

585
00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:33.160
<v Speaker 4>myself now?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What mission can I accomplish?</v>

586
00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:34.820
<v Speaker 4>And it's not there anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no people,</v>

587
00:28:34.821 --> 00:28:39.821
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's the structure of things are </v>

588
00:28:39.821 --> 00:28:39.821
<v Speaker 4>gone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the command is gone.</v>

589
00:28:39.821 --> 00:28:43.870
<v Speaker 4>It's just you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think if it hadn't been for my </v>

590
00:28:43.870 --> 00:28:47.171
<v Speaker 4>wife,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've never even would have gone in to </v>

591
00:28:47.171 --> 00:28:48.080
<v Speaker 4>the va honestly because there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's just happened to be someone that</v>

592
00:28:48.081 --> 00:28:52.160
<v Speaker 4>lived with me the whole time who's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you need to go in or I'm gone.</v>

593
00:28:52.490 --> 00:28:56.210
<v Speaker 4>And I mean if she hadn't been there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd probably still be that way.</v>

594
00:28:56.211 --> 00:28:57.290
<v Speaker 4>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Honestly,</v>

595
00:28:57.650 --> 00:29:02.650
<v Speaker 4>the UFC has done a lot of work for a </v>
<v Speaker 4>traumatic brain injury and uh,</v>

596
00:29:02.690 --> 00:29:03.230
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

597
00:29:03.290 --> 00:29:08.000
<v Speaker 4>in helping to fund the Intrepid Center </v>
<v Speaker 4>for traumatic brain injury.</v>

598
00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:13.280
<v Speaker 4>And one of the most shocking things to </v>
<v Speaker 4>me when we got involved,</v>

599
00:29:13.281 --> 00:29:14.780
<v Speaker 4>we started doing these fights with the </v>
<v Speaker 4>troops,</v>

600
00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:20.080
<v Speaker 4>was that there was no funding for this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that they had to get funding from other </v>

601
00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:24.671
<v Speaker 4>sources that they had to get funding </v>
<v Speaker 4>from donations and they had to ask </v>

602
00:29:24.671 --> 00:29:28.331
<v Speaker 4>people to call in and donate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And just unbelievably shocking to me </v>

603
00:29:28.331 --> 00:29:31.670
<v Speaker 4>that we spend so much money to send </v>
<v Speaker 4>these guys over there.</v>

604
00:29:31.671 --> 00:29:36.671
<v Speaker 4>So much money for weapons and so much </v>
<v Speaker 4>money for the latest high tech ways to </v>

605
00:29:38.781 --> 00:29:42.010
<v Speaker 4>kill people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so little on how to treat</v>

606
00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:44.050
<v Speaker 7>these guys when they come back.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And girls.</v>

607
00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:45.480
<v Speaker 7>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's an issue,</v>

608
00:29:45.550 --> 00:29:50.550
<v Speaker 7>so little money and also so little </v>
<v Speaker 7>imagination and so little willingness </v>

609
00:29:50.550 --> 00:29:50.830
<v Speaker 7>to,</v>
<v Speaker 7>to explore new things.</v>

610
00:29:50.831 --> 00:29:52.510
<v Speaker 7>We're talking about a fucking blood </v>
<v Speaker 7>test.</v>

611
00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:57.600
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He's talking about a blood test to test </v>

612
00:29:57.600 --> 00:29:57.610
<v Speaker 7>their hormones and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>

613
00:29:57.611 --> 00:30:00.550
<v Speaker 7>what a crazy idea.</v>
<v Speaker 7>This guy's out of the box.</v>

614
00:30:00.551 --> 00:30:01.780
<v Speaker 7>He's crackers,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

615
00:30:01.781 --> 00:30:02.920
<v Speaker 7>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's.</v>

616
00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:04.420
<v Speaker 7>You look at the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you look at,</v>

617
00:30:04.750 --> 00:30:09.750
<v Speaker 7>at the symptoms,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they're having the same symptoms the </v>

618
00:30:09.750 --> 00:30:11.530
<v Speaker 7>guys in the nfl are having.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's the same symptoms that guys would.</v>

619
00:30:11.531 --> 00:30:15.850
<v Speaker 7>Low Testosterone or habit and it's not a</v>
<v Speaker 7>huge mystery,</v>

620
00:30:16.270 --> 00:30:21.270
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but it is a mystery to all these people </v>

621
00:30:21.270 --> 00:30:24.451
<v Speaker 7>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we're also talking about Kris Carr who </v>

622
00:30:24.451 --> 00:30:26.470
<v Speaker 7>was the Achilles of Iraq and like that </v>
<v Speaker 7>guy was having a hard time.</v>

623
00:30:27.070 --> 00:30:30.670
<v Speaker 7>That guy had to go through the same </v>
<v Speaker 7>thing and go talk to somebody.</v>

624
00:30:31.150 --> 00:30:36.150
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there's a lot of guys out there who </v>

625
00:30:36.150 --> 00:30:37.600
<v Speaker 7>served and got no thanks for it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They've got no recognition.</v>

626
00:30:37.870 --> 00:30:40.110
<v Speaker 7>They got.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They were anonymous soldiers in a,</v>

627
00:30:40.111 --> 00:30:44.200
<v Speaker 7>in a war that nobody wanted and they </v>
<v Speaker 7>came home and they were messed up.</v>

628
00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:45.700
<v Speaker 7>Most,</v>
<v Speaker 7>most of them.</v>

629
00:30:45.730 --> 00:30:47.380
<v Speaker 7>Most are like that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

630
00:30:47.381 --> 00:30:48.010
<v Speaker 7>and,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and look,</v>

631
00:30:48.370 --> 00:30:50.680
<v Speaker 7>I'm sure there's guys who came home and </v>
<v Speaker 7>they were okay.</v>

632
00:30:50.681 --> 00:30:53.650
<v Speaker 7>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I haven't met a ton of those guys.</v>

633
00:30:53.651 --> 00:30:55.540
<v Speaker 7>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 7>some of the seals are like that.</v>

634
00:30:55.541 --> 00:30:57.040
<v Speaker 7>They're fun,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

635
00:30:57.310 --> 00:31:02.310
<v Speaker 7>God bless.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But I spent the last year after writing </v>

636
00:31:02.310 --> 00:31:02.620
<v Speaker 7>sniper,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm adapting a book called thank you for</v>

637
00:31:02.621 --> 00:31:05.290
<v Speaker 7>your service and this guy followed these</v>
<v Speaker 7>guys home.</v>

638
00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:07.960
<v Speaker 7>He followed a battalion of army guys </v>
<v Speaker 7>home from,</v>

639
00:31:07.961 --> 00:31:12.961
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>from Iraq and followed their wanderings </v>

640
00:31:12.961 --> 00:31:14.790
<v Speaker 7>into like how they were going to get </v>
<v Speaker 7>back into their lives and how they,</v>

641
00:31:14.830 --> 00:31:17.890
<v Speaker 7>these guys were going to deal with their</v>
<v Speaker 7>stress and dealing with the Va.</v>

642
00:31:17.891 --> 00:31:21.640
<v Speaker 7>And it was a nightmare man.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And you meet these guys that just,</v>

643
00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:24.640
<v Speaker 7>they don't have any hope.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They don't have any hope.</v>

644
00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:26.500
<v Speaker 7>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>some of them have,</v>

645
00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:31.620
<v Speaker 7>have,</v>
<v Speaker 7>have the ptsd and some of them have </v>

646
00:31:31.620 --> 00:31:32.440
<v Speaker 7>additional injuries like matthew had and</v>
<v Speaker 7>they've got nothing.</v>

647
00:31:33.610 --> 00:31:36.160
<v Speaker 7>They've got nothing in the va is like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

648
00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:41.520
<v Speaker 7>you're talking 22 soldiers a day kill </v>
<v Speaker 7>themselves for soldiers who have killed </v>

649
00:31:42.221 --> 00:31:47.221
<v Speaker 7>themselves and have died.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And they'll correct which is the first </v>

650
00:31:47.221 --> 00:31:47.221
<v Speaker 7>time in any war in us history.</v>

651
00:31:47.221 --> 00:31:48.260
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the thing we keep,</v>

652
00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:53.500
<v Speaker 3>we keep records of it now there's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>website which is called prevention and </v>

653
00:31:55.431 --> 00:31:57.740
<v Speaker 3>awareness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>suicide prevention awareness,</v>

654
00:31:57.741 --> 00:32:02.741
<v Speaker 3>which is a military site which keeps </v>
<v Speaker 3>track of all the suicides and also </v>

655
00:32:02.991 --> 00:32:07.991
<v Speaker 3>things to prevent it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they keep records of the dod in the </v>

656
00:32:07.991 --> 00:32:08.330
<v Speaker 3>22 a day I think is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

657
00:32:08.510 --> 00:32:13.510
<v Speaker 3>is not an accurate number.</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there was another report that came </v>

658
00:32:13.510 --> 00:32:14.150
<v Speaker 3>out where it's like 40 today where it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>even more,</v>

659
00:32:14.390 --> 00:32:19.390
<v Speaker 3>but you're right in 2012,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they started really releasing the </v>

660
00:32:19.390 --> 00:32:19.550
<v Speaker 3>numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there were more people killed,</v>

661
00:32:20.180 --> 00:32:25.180
<v Speaker 3>more people committed suicide.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then people were killed in A year of </v>

662
00:32:25.180 --> 00:32:28.240
<v Speaker 3>fighting in 2000 unfucking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Believable from a patient standpoint </v>

663
00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:32.470
<v Speaker 3>going into the va.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I liked the va and they've been nothing </v>

664
00:32:32.470 --> 00:32:35.831
<v Speaker 3>but very kind to me and very good to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I don't have anything in that regard </v>

665
00:32:35.831 --> 00:32:39.700
<v Speaker 3>to say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when you go in there and you get </v>

666
00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:40.190
<v Speaker 3>diagnosed with ptsd,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they you</v>

667
00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:44.300
<v Speaker 4>one of the meds and to with all these </v>
<v Speaker 4>appointments to talk to people who want,</v>

668
00:32:44.330 --> 00:32:46.580
<v Speaker 4>you're not gonna fucking relate to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry,</v>

669
00:32:46.581 --> 00:32:51.581
<v Speaker 4>but ms dot susie over there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hasn't seen what I've seen or done what </v>

670
00:32:51.581 --> 00:32:55.031
<v Speaker 4>I've done and she's trying to engage me </v>
<v Speaker 4>in this conversation and all I want to </v>

671
00:32:55.031 --> 00:32:59.381
<v Speaker 4>do a slim face on the floor because </v>
<v Speaker 4>she's trying to act as if she's my </v>

672
00:32:59.381 --> 00:33:01.160
<v Speaker 4>friend and knows what I'm talking about </v>
<v Speaker 4>and she doesn't.</v>

673
00:33:01.310 --> 00:33:06.310
<v Speaker 4>And I know she only has goodwill,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but as a patient sitting there and this </v>

674
00:33:06.310 --> 00:33:10.010
<v Speaker 4>is supposed to help you and it's not </v>
<v Speaker 4>helping you like this is fucking stupid.</v>

675
00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:15.160
<v Speaker 4>And that's what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Most people go to like one or two </v>

676
00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:15.160
<v Speaker 4>sessions and never go to counseling </v>
<v Speaker 4>again.</v>

677
00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:19.040
<v Speaker 4>You cannot fix the mind when the body is</v>
<v Speaker 4>not working.</v>

678
00:33:19.041 --> 00:33:21.500
<v Speaker 4>When it's physiologically not working </v>
<v Speaker 4>correctly,</v>

679
00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:24.110
<v Speaker 4>the mind will never get better.</v>

680
00:33:24.170 --> 00:33:27.040
<v Speaker 4>So that's essentially what's happening </v>
<v Speaker 4>is they're trying to fix these ma,</v>

681
00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:31.370
<v Speaker 4>the mind and these mental issues without</v>
<v Speaker 4>fixing the physiological aspect of it.</v>

682
00:33:31.700 --> 00:33:34.190
<v Speaker 4>And then wondering why none of these </v>
<v Speaker 4>people are getting better.</v>

683
00:33:34.580 --> 00:33:35.330
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

684
00:33:35.420 --> 00:33:37.310
<v Speaker 4>why are none of these medications </v>
<v Speaker 4>working?</v>

685
00:33:37.460 --> 00:33:39.290
<v Speaker 4>How many more medications can we give </v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

686
00:33:39.650 --> 00:33:44.650
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>before you end up in a situation like </v>

687
00:33:44.650 --> 00:33:44.650
<v Speaker 4>mine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's what's happening.</v>

688
00:33:44.650 --> 00:33:49.240
<v Speaker 4>And it's that part of it is ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that part of it angers me because it</v>

689
00:33:49.491 --> 00:33:51.170
<v Speaker 4>is such an easy fix.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's such a,</v>

690
00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:53.480
<v Speaker 4>it seems like an easy fix,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

691
00:33:53.540 --> 00:33:56.570
<v Speaker 4>as a patient that was effective fix in </v>
<v Speaker 4>effect the fix.</v>

692
00:33:56.840 --> 00:33:58.060
<v Speaker 4>But it's that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

693
00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:03.760
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember when I first was going in </v>

694
00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:03.760
<v Speaker 4>there for my chronic pain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

695
00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:06.200
<v Speaker 4>they started me off with like aspirin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>tylenol.</v>

696
00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:08.390
<v Speaker 4>They went through this progression to </v>
<v Speaker 4>where they were.</v>

697
00:34:08.630 --> 00:34:11.030
<v Speaker 4>And I remember my doctor look at me </v>
<v Speaker 4>saying,</v>

698
00:34:11.031 --> 00:34:14.000
<v Speaker 4>I know what you need,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I have to do it this way.</v>

699
00:34:14.510 --> 00:34:19.510
<v Speaker 4>So not only did I waste another six </v>
<v Speaker 4>months to a year going on these </v>

700
00:34:19.510 --> 00:34:20.420
<v Speaker 4>ineffective because I did need something</v>
<v Speaker 4>for my pain,</v>

701
00:34:20.421 --> 00:34:24.230
<v Speaker 4>probably not what they gave me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's just another,</v>

702
00:34:24.231 --> 00:34:24.930
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

703
00:34:25.100 --> 00:34:28.700
<v Speaker 4>example of sometimes I think they know </v>
<v Speaker 4>that it's not working,</v>

704
00:34:28.701 --> 00:34:31.190
<v Speaker 4>but they're in this bureaucracy where </v>
<v Speaker 4>they have to just,</v>

705
00:34:31.290 --> 00:34:33.040
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

706
00:34:33.050 --> 00:34:35.000
<v Speaker 4>it's a federal institution.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have to do this.</v>

707
00:34:35.001 --> 00:34:37.730
<v Speaker 4>That's what they have to have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of a chain of prescriptions.</v>

708
00:34:37.750 --> 00:34:39.260
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this just didn't work.</v>

709
00:34:39.261 --> 00:34:41.840
<v Speaker 4>We tried that and documentation of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that what it is?</v>

710
00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:42.590
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

711
00:34:42.591 --> 00:34:47.591
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a rainbow of medications that </v>

712
00:34:47.591 --> 00:34:49.541
<v Speaker 4>everyone starts off on it seems like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's what everyone's getting when </v>

713
00:34:49.541 --> 00:34:51.710
<v Speaker 4>they go in there and then they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>wondering while none of them are effect,</v>

714
00:34:51.711 --> 00:34:53.180
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some of them are effective,</v>

715
00:34:53.181 --> 00:34:55.280
<v Speaker 4>but as a whole they're not.</v>

716
00:34:55.340 --> 00:34:56.360
<v Speaker 4>And so you go in there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

717
00:34:56.361 --> 00:34:58.220
<v Speaker 4>I was going in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

718
00:34:58.700 --> 00:35:00.800
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would go in after 30 days,</v>

719
00:35:01.330 --> 00:35:02.270
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really do anything.</v>

720
00:35:02.271 --> 00:35:03.920
<v Speaker 4>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's try it another two months.</v>

721
00:35:03.980 --> 00:35:05.120
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's three months.</v>

722
00:35:05.420 --> 00:35:10.420
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's either up your dose or let's just </v>

723
00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:10.420
<v Speaker 4>throw that shit in the garbage and give </v>
<v Speaker 4>you something else.</v>

724
00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:14.620
<v Speaker 4>So noT only are you taking something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my body's been on for three months now </v>

725
00:35:14.620 --> 00:35:15.170
<v Speaker 4>and then just introducing it to </v>
<v Speaker 4>something else.</v>

726
00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:17.390
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that I was like,</v>

727
00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:22.480
<v Speaker 4>I was becoming worse.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was just becoming more just not when </v>

728
00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:27.040
<v Speaker 4>the frustration,</v>
<v Speaker 4>frustration you need by the end of that </v>

729
00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:30.000
<v Speaker 4>you need a stronger medication just to </v>
<v Speaker 4>deal with all the appointments you've </v>

730
00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:30.000
<v Speaker 4>been to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

731
00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:30.110
<v Speaker 4>It's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

732
00:35:30.111 --> 00:35:35.111
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did stop going to all my mental </v>

733
00:35:35.111 --> 00:35:35.410
<v Speaker 4>counseling sessions because I knew that </v>
<v Speaker 4>wasn't,</v>

734
00:35:35.470 --> 00:35:37.070
<v Speaker 4>was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wasn't what was going to help me.</v>

735
00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:39.330
<v Speaker 4>I didn't need,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially not talking to them,</v>

736
00:35:39.570 --> 00:35:41.250
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe maybe a friend or something,</v>

737
00:35:41.540 --> 00:35:44.220
<v Speaker 4>but a lot of that stuff that happens </v>
<v Speaker 4>over there,</v>

738
00:35:44.790 --> 00:35:47.850
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to talk about it at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's very sacred.</v>

739
00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:52.880
<v Speaker 4>It's very personal and intimate and to </v>
<v Speaker 4>me it's not a game.</v>

740
00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:56.040
<v Speaker 4>Most of the people around you talk to </v>
<v Speaker 4>you and it's a fucking video game.</v>

741
00:35:56.240 --> 00:35:58.650
<v Speaker 4>It's cAlled a duty and they sit there </v>
<v Speaker 4>and they talk,</v>

742
00:35:58.660 --> 00:36:03.660
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they talk and he was at that like that </v>

743
00:36:03.660 --> 00:36:03.660
<v Speaker 4>and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>listen,</v>

744
00:36:03.660 --> 00:36:04.710
<v Speaker 4>this is not okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you just don't say anything.</v>

745
00:36:05.070 --> 00:36:10.070
<v Speaker 4>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to tell my wife because </v>

746
00:36:10.070 --> 00:36:10.240
<v Speaker 4>she doesn't need to know any of this </v>
<v Speaker 4>horror stuff that I went through.</v>

747
00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:12.600
<v Speaker 4>So you just internalize it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You internalize it,</v>

748
00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:17.840
<v Speaker 4>you're buddies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You almost don't want to talk about it </v>

749
00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:20.241
<v Speaker 4>because you know either you're still </v>
<v Speaker 4>buddies or just anyone else she knew in </v>

750
00:36:20.241 --> 00:36:23.181
<v Speaker 4>the military because then you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>bringing it up to the surface again so </v>

751
00:36:23.181 --> 00:36:25.230
<v Speaker 4>it just becomes this thing where you </v>
<v Speaker 4>take the deepest aspect of your soul and</v>

752
00:36:25.231 --> 00:36:30.231
<v Speaker 4>you just shut the fuck in there and then</v>
<v Speaker 4>you pray and walk away and that is part </v>

753
00:36:30.231 --> 00:36:32.460
<v Speaker 4>of the problem and it's a mental issue.</v>

754
00:36:32.550 --> 00:36:36.660
<v Speaker 4>It's that mental issue of like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it progresses down this,</v>

755
00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:41.010
<v Speaker 4>this slope downhill because when your </v>
<v Speaker 4>body just starts smell functioning,</v>

756
00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:44.360
<v Speaker 4>all this stuff that you're trying to </v>
<v Speaker 4>deal with mentally goes with it.</v>

757
00:36:44.660 --> 00:36:49.660
<v Speaker 4>It just all goes down and then you then </v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't start handling just the daily </v>

758
00:36:49.660 --> 00:36:51.390
<v Speaker 4>things of life around you can't handle,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

759
00:36:51.391 --> 00:36:53.370
<v Speaker 4>they got my coffee wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All right,</v>

760
00:36:53.371 --> 00:36:56.250
<v Speaker 4>well now I'm fucking pissed and let's go</v>
<v Speaker 4>break a ton of shit.</v>

761
00:36:56.640 --> 00:36:58.050
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just simple things like that,</v>

762
00:36:58.051 --> 00:36:59.070
<v Speaker 4>that everyday it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

763
00:36:59.080 --> 00:37:00.810
<v Speaker 4>it's not a big issue,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

764
00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:04.740
<v Speaker 4>but you can't handle the little things </v>
<v Speaker 4>around you and you don't have a buffer.</v>

765
00:37:05.130 --> 00:37:06.180
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no buffer.</v>

766
00:37:06.181 --> 00:37:07.830
<v Speaker 4>There's no nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

767
00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:13.640
<v Speaker 4>and you find things to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I tried to find all kinds of hobbies to </v>

768
00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:13.980
<v Speaker 4>do and they work for a week,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then you're just,</v>

769
00:37:14.010 --> 00:37:19.010
<v Speaker 4>you realize you're right where you were </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you just keep moving on and it just </v>

770
00:37:19.010 --> 00:37:21.681
<v Speaker 4>never gets better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's the thing that was so </v>

771
00:37:21.681 --> 00:37:21.681
<v Speaker 4>frustrating about it.</v>

772
00:37:21.681 --> 00:37:23.770
<v Speaker 6>It's also got to be frustrating for you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Dr.</v>

773
00:37:23.770 --> 00:37:28.770
<v Speaker 6>Gordon,</v>
<v Speaker 6>to know that there's sort of an </v>

774
00:37:28.770 --> 00:37:32.550
<v Speaker 6>ignorance involved in just treating the </v>
<v Speaker 6>mind or just treating the symptoms of </v>

775
00:37:34.301 --> 00:37:39.301
<v Speaker 6>antidepressants with these kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 6>medications when you're dealing with so </v>

776
00:37:39.301 --> 00:37:42.631
<v Speaker 6>many different things holistically.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The entire body has so many issues that </v>

777
00:37:42.631 --> 00:37:46.441
<v Speaker 6>aren't being addressed and they just </v>
<v Speaker 6>addressing this one thing because this </v>

778
00:37:46.441 --> 00:37:46.840
<v Speaker 6>is all these doctors know,</v>

779
00:37:47.140 --> 00:37:52.140
<v Speaker 3>correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really an a masking process that </v>

780
00:37:52.211 --> 00:37:55.030
<v Speaker 3>they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The patient has complaints of isolation,</v>

781
00:37:55.031 --> 00:37:57.310
<v Speaker 3>which matthew had isolation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>withdrawal,</v>

782
00:37:58.630 --> 00:38:01.630
<v Speaker 3>and hedonism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He weren't enjoying doing the things you</v>

783
00:38:01.631 --> 00:38:03.780
<v Speaker 3>were enjoying before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's classical depression.</v>

784
00:38:03.781 --> 00:38:06.130
<v Speaker 3>So we'll put them on an antidepressant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

785
00:38:06.131 --> 00:38:11.131
<v Speaker 3>you're having difficulty sleeping and </v>
<v Speaker 3>put them on tresona and put them on </v>

786
00:38:11.131 --> 00:38:11.740
<v Speaker 3>whatever medication in the frustration </v>
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>

787
00:38:11.741 --> 00:38:14.590
<v Speaker 3>The literature is so clear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

788
00:38:14.650 --> 00:38:19.650
<v Speaker 3>I didn't invent anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just sit in front of the computer for </v>

789
00:38:19.650 --> 00:38:19.990
<v Speaker 3>eight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nine hours a day and read the literature</v>

790
00:38:19.991 --> 00:38:24.991
<v Speaker 3>that's coming out from all over the </v>
<v Speaker 3>planet and they're so compelling that I </v>

791
00:38:24.991 --> 00:38:26.300
<v Speaker 3>put it into clinical application,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

792
00:38:26.650 --> 00:38:31.650
<v Speaker 3>with not only the veterans but with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>civilians who have had traumatic brain </v>

793
00:38:31.650 --> 00:38:32.640
<v Speaker 3>injury from motor vehicle accidents,</v>
<v Speaker 3>slip and fall,</v>

794
00:38:32.650 --> 00:38:35.860
<v Speaker 3>what have you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the responses across the board.</v>

795
00:38:35.890 --> 00:38:40.890
<v Speaker 3>Once you find the laboratory proven </v>
<v Speaker 3>deficiencies or insufficiencies and you </v>

796
00:38:43.511 --> 00:38:45.970
<v Speaker 3>replace it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get these incredible responses.</v>

797
00:38:46.030 --> 00:38:51.030
<v Speaker 3>A woman 32 years ago who had an motor </v>
<v Speaker 3>vehicle accident head on we're neck,</v>

798
00:38:51.281 --> 00:38:56.281
<v Speaker 3>hit the steering wheel and crushed her </v>
<v Speaker 3>karate and she had a stroke on the </v>

799
00:38:56.281 --> 00:38:59.371
<v Speaker 3>opposite side,</v>
<v Speaker 3>32 years of being on a multitude of </v>

800
00:38:59.371 --> 00:39:01.540
<v Speaker 3>medications and then she comes in and </v>
<v Speaker 3>within a month she's feeling better.</v>

801
00:39:01.541 --> 00:39:06.541
<v Speaker 3>They had her on adderall to counteract </v>
<v Speaker 3>the side effects of the five </v>

802
00:39:06.541 --> 00:39:07.990
<v Speaker 3>psychotropic drugs like the ssri is and </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever and whatever,</v>

803
00:39:08.650 --> 00:39:13.650
<v Speaker 3>and I'm at one month goes back to her </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychiatrist in the south and she says </v>

804
00:39:14.141 --> 00:39:15.560
<v Speaker 3>to the doc,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a female doc,</v>

805
00:39:15.561 --> 00:39:17.530
<v Speaker 3>she says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd like to get off these medications.</v>

806
00:39:17.531 --> 00:39:19.090
<v Speaker 3>The doc says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>honey,</v>

807
00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:21.490
<v Speaker 3>I put people on antidepressants.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I adam,</v>

808
00:39:21.491 --> 00:39:24.280
<v Speaker 3>take them off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's the mentality that we have to</v>

809
00:39:24.281 --> 00:39:27.970
<v Speaker 3>start educating that there are all our </v>
<v Speaker 3>alternatives,</v>

810
00:39:28.060 --> 00:39:31.210
<v Speaker 3>but they're being told the quick fix is </v>
<v Speaker 3>to put them on an antidepressant.</v>

811
00:39:31.210 --> 00:39:34.120
<v Speaker 3>Listening to matthew story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in 10 days,</v>

812
00:39:34.150 --> 00:39:39.150
<v Speaker 3>the clouds started to lift.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The fog started to dissipate and by six </v>

813
00:39:39.150 --> 00:39:41.980
<v Speaker 3>weeks he was coming back to who matthew </v>
<v Speaker 3>remembered himself being.</v>

814
00:39:42.230 --> 00:39:47.230
<v Speaker 3>That's the place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then that's the place where he can deal </v>

815
00:39:47.230 --> 00:39:47.980
<v Speaker 3>with the other stuff that has been </v>
<v Speaker 3>suppressing.</v>

816
00:39:48.040 --> 00:39:48.880
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>correct.</v>

817
00:39:48.970 --> 00:39:49.900
<v Speaker 3>Exact.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because these are.</v>

818
00:39:49.930 --> 00:39:52.820
<v Speaker 3>These things are not independent of each</v>
<v Speaker 3>other.</v>

819
00:39:53.500 --> 00:39:56.080
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the past I started in 2004.</v>

820
00:39:56.081 --> 00:40:00.430
<v Speaker 3>I had four head traumas and when I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>between 34 and 46,</v>

821
00:40:00.431 --> 00:40:02.080
<v Speaker 3>I think I shared this with you once </v>
<v Speaker 3>before.</v>

822
00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:07.500
<v Speaker 3>Between 34 and 46 I started developing </v>
<v Speaker 3>depression was depression was on paxil </v>

823
00:40:08.410 --> 00:40:10.990
<v Speaker 3>just wasn't a happy camper.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What will your head traumas from,</v>

824
00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:16.160
<v Speaker 3>let's say at four years of age,</v>
<v Speaker 3>playing jungle gym in New York during </v>

825
00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:16.160
<v Speaker 3>the winter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hit my head on the metal bars,</v>

826
00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:18.520
<v Speaker 3>landed up in the ground at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>believe it or not,</v>

827
00:40:18.521 --> 00:40:19.020
<v Speaker 3>I was sitting,</v>

828
00:40:20.940 --> 00:40:24.000
<v Speaker 3>dare you shut that off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shoot it.</v>

829
00:40:25.110 --> 00:40:30.110
<v Speaker 3>And then when I was riding my bicycle to</v>
<v Speaker 3>a hebrew school at between twelVe and </v>

830
00:40:30.110 --> 00:40:35.091
<v Speaker 3>13,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was hit by a car and knocked down or </v>

831
00:40:35.091 --> 00:40:35.091
<v Speaker 3>cut my face,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cut my chin.</v>

832
00:40:35.220 --> 00:40:37.410
<v Speaker 3>let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At 18 years of age on the swim team,</v>

833
00:40:37.411 --> 00:40:39.710
<v Speaker 3>I was screwing around and hit my head on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the swimming poured.</v>

834
00:40:39.870 --> 00:40:43.290
<v Speaker 3>And then in the February 9th,</v>
<v Speaker 3>February 9th,</v>

835
00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:45.420
<v Speaker 3>19,</v>
<v Speaker 3>71 sylmar earthquake,</v>

836
00:40:45.421 --> 00:40:48.240
<v Speaker 3>before you were born,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a shelf,</v>

837
00:40:48.290 --> 00:40:51.360
<v Speaker 3>a large shelf fell on my head and </v>
<v Speaker 3>knocked me out.</v>

838
00:40:51.690 --> 00:40:53.100
<v Speaker 3>So I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

839
00:40:53.130 --> 00:40:55.620
<v Speaker 3>went through undergraduate medical </v>
<v Speaker 3>school,</v>

840
00:40:55.621 --> 00:40:57.030
<v Speaker 3>residency.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything was fine,</v>

841
00:40:57.031 --> 00:41:02.031
<v Speaker 3>but between 34 and 46 started developing</v>
<v Speaker 3>all these symptoms and then I went to a </v>

842
00:41:02.031 --> 00:41:04.920
<v Speaker 3>facility and I had my hormones checked </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I was thyroid,</v>

843
00:41:05.070 --> 00:41:07.170
<v Speaker 3>which you saw me take earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thyroid,</v>

844
00:41:07.260 --> 00:41:09.810
<v Speaker 3>testosterone growth hormone deficient </v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

845
00:41:09.811 --> 00:41:11.340
<v Speaker 3>started on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And within a period,</v>

846
00:41:11.341 --> 00:41:13.170
<v Speaker 3>let's see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>august to November 3rd,</v>

847
00:41:13.171 --> 00:41:17.370
<v Speaker 3>I woke up totally different person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>similar to what matthew was stating.</v>

848
00:41:17.460 --> 00:41:22.460
<v Speaker 3>And not until that was 99,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not until 2004 when I read an article </v>

849
00:41:23.160 --> 00:41:24.780
<v Speaker 3>out of Turkey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Turkey,</v>

850
00:41:24.781 --> 00:41:26.730
<v Speaker 3>they have a lot of pugilist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like boxing.</v>

851
00:41:27.030 --> 00:41:32.030
<v Speaker 3>And there was this one article that said</v>
<v Speaker 3>that boxers in Turkey were found to have</v>

852
00:41:32.550 --> 00:41:35.600
<v Speaker 3>unusually high amounts of growth hormone</v>
<v Speaker 3>deficiency.</v>

853
00:41:35.810 --> 00:41:38.210
<v Speaker 3>And the following year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>muay thai in Thailand came out.</v>

854
00:41:38.211 --> 00:41:43.211
<v Speaker 3>And then that was my epiphany.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went back to the literature and </v>

855
00:41:43.211 --> 00:41:43.211
<v Speaker 3>started finding one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two,</v>

856
00:41:43.211 --> 00:41:47.381
<v Speaker 3>five,</v>
<v Speaker 3>10 articles talking about head trauma </v>

857
00:41:47.381 --> 00:41:48.320
<v Speaker 3>associated with hormone deficiency and </v>
<v Speaker 3>from 2014 to present,</v>

858
00:41:48.590 --> 00:41:53.590
<v Speaker 3>that's all I read is these relationships</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we know in gerontology and geriatric</v>

859
00:41:54.891 --> 00:41:59.891
<v Speaker 3>medicine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>internal medicine that as mail gets to </v>

860
00:41:59.891 --> 00:42:03.311
<v Speaker 3>be in sixties and seventies that you see</v>
<v Speaker 3>them go through a process that they </v>

861
00:42:03.311 --> 00:42:04.430
<v Speaker 3>called dysthymia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a mild kind of a blue,</v>

862
00:42:04.460 --> 00:42:09.460
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>feeling blue depression and they have </v>

863
00:42:09.460 --> 00:42:09.590
<v Speaker 3>significant testosterone deficiency.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you replaced it,</v>

864
00:42:09.591 --> 00:42:10.130
<v Speaker 3>they get better.</v>

865
00:42:10.340 --> 00:42:14.930
<v Speaker 3>so why can't we see that things that </v>
<v Speaker 3>accelerate your last head trauma leading</v>

866
00:42:14.931 --> 00:42:17.600
<v Speaker 3>to testosterone deficiency causing </v>
<v Speaker 3>depression,</v>

867
00:42:18.260 --> 00:42:21.020
<v Speaker 3>that looking at the older generation who</v>
<v Speaker 3>have,</v>

868
00:42:21.021 --> 00:42:24.020
<v Speaker 3>or the older age individuals who have </v>
<v Speaker 3>hormone deficiency,</v>

869
00:42:24.021 --> 00:42:26.810
<v Speaker 3>both males and females that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>developed depression.</v>

870
00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:32.080
<v Speaker 3>Why can't you link the two?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's where the problem's been in </v>

871
00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:34.571
<v Speaker 3>linking the two issues.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hormone deficiency for whatever cause </v>

872
00:42:34.571 --> 00:42:35.450
<v Speaker 3>can predispose you to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

873
00:42:35.451 --> 00:42:36.710
<v Speaker 3>issues of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

874
00:42:36.970 --> 00:42:37.810
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

875
00:42:37.930 --> 00:42:42.930
<v Speaker 3>psychological problems and psychological</v>
<v Speaker 3>problems like depression is the number </v>

876
00:42:44.421 --> 00:42:46.520
<v Speaker 3>one is fatigued.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you have fatigue,</v>

877
00:42:47.180 --> 00:42:49.610
<v Speaker 3>fatigue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fatigue with out being able to sleep,</v>

878
00:42:49.730 --> 00:42:51.290
<v Speaker 3>correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fatigue,</v>

879
00:42:51.380 --> 00:42:53.060
<v Speaker 3>insomnia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>depression,</v>

880
00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:56.090
<v Speaker 3>rage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just for no reason.</v>

881
00:42:56.091 --> 00:42:59.060
<v Speaker 3>You just start being angry and rage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>screaming at people.</v>

882
00:42:59.270 --> 00:43:01.340
<v Speaker 3>Patients has gone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a libido,</v>

883
00:43:01.341 --> 00:43:04.820
<v Speaker 3>sexual drive is gone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You start doubting yourself.</v>

884
00:43:04.821 --> 00:43:09.821
<v Speaker 3>A sense of wellbeing is gone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A plum has gone confidence and </v>

885
00:43:09.821 --> 00:43:12.320
<v Speaker 3>assertiveness has gone and that's this </v>
<v Speaker 3>issue of what they call co-morbidity.</v>

886
00:43:12.590 --> 00:43:15.080
<v Speaker 3>When you're arguing the fact of it being</v>
<v Speaker 3>ptsd,</v>

887
00:43:15.081 --> 00:43:18.770
<v Speaker 3>psychological versus a physiological </v>
<v Speaker 3>cause for that psychological,</v>

888
00:43:19.100 --> 00:43:24.100
<v Speaker 3>I think the head trauma creates the </v>
<v Speaker 3>scenario biochemically to allow you to </v>

889
00:43:24.100 --> 00:43:27.581
<v Speaker 3>have sensitivity to these things that </v>
<v Speaker 3>are called cycle effect of disease or </v>

890
00:43:27.581 --> 00:43:29.960
<v Speaker 3>cycle neurotic diseases or whatever </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're using today.</v>

891
00:43:30.350 --> 00:43:35.350
<v Speaker 3>So it predisposes it so it mAkes you </v>
<v Speaker 3>susceptible to the correct or the bad </v>

892
00:43:35.350 --> 00:43:35.810
<v Speaker 3>thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Correct.</v>

893
00:43:35.900 --> 00:43:37.220
<v Speaker 3>What's the difference between,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

894
00:43:37.250 --> 00:43:39.710
<v Speaker 3>you were talking when you were talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>to jason,</v>

895
00:43:39.711 --> 00:43:41.990
<v Speaker 3>that when you saw,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when chris saw his kids,</v>

896
00:43:41.991 --> 00:43:45.710
<v Speaker 3>his personality changed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was the stimulus that was something</v>

897
00:43:45.711 --> 00:43:46.270
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

898
00:43:46.460 --> 00:43:48.980
<v Speaker 3>put them on a peak.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Same thing with hormone correction.</v>

899
00:43:49.010 --> 00:43:52.970
<v Speaker 3>It can correct those thoughts and we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>finding something called neuro steroids,</v>

900
00:43:53.330 --> 00:43:58.330
<v Speaker 3>which are the minor hormones that run </v>
<v Speaker 3>through our body that are lost during </v>

901
00:43:58.330 --> 00:44:02.540
<v Speaker 3>inflammatory processes throughout the </v>
<v Speaker 3>body can affect the brain that stabilize</v>

902
00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:04.760
<v Speaker 3>our ability to not be schizophrenia.</v>

903
00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:09.800
<v Speaker 3>Our ability not to be depressed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our cognitive ability so that the long </v>

904
00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:14.381
<v Speaker 3>neurons that conduct information over </v>
<v Speaker 3>long period of time to ingrain our raw </v>

905
00:44:14.381 --> 00:44:19.010
<v Speaker 3>memories and so forth are stabilized.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you lose that stabilization,</v>

906
00:44:19.011 --> 00:44:24.011
<v Speaker 3>it's like pulling the plug.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You lose that ability to control it or </v>

907
00:44:24.011 --> 00:44:24.350
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>turning the sound all the way down.</v>

908
00:44:24.620 --> 00:44:29.620
<v Speaker 3>So by correcting the hormones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that allows for the sound to come back </v>

909
00:44:29.620 --> 00:44:32.741
<v Speaker 3>up to where it should be so that you can</v>
<v Speaker 3>function at the level that I'm matthew </v>

910
00:44:32.741 --> 00:44:37.251
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have a lot of people that have had a </v>

911
00:44:37.251 --> 00:44:37.251
<v Speaker 3>multitude of injuries.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

912
00:44:37.251 --> 00:44:41.780
<v Speaker 3>what happened was because of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>laboratory access medical lab in </v>

913
00:44:41.780 --> 00:44:43.470
<v Speaker 3>Florida,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they gave me a grant.</v>

914
00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:49.040
<v Speaker 3>And what happens that they gave me a </v>
<v Speaker 3>chunk of money and I matched it out of </v>

915
00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:53.220
<v Speaker 3>my pocket of my practice to provide the </v>
<v Speaker 3>type of services that matthew in a large</v>

916
00:44:54.841 --> 00:44:58.410
<v Speaker 3>group of other vets from the green </v>
<v Speaker 3>berets from the navy.</v>

917
00:44:59.150 --> 00:45:00.750
<v Speaker 3>Unshipped navy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's same navy,</v>

918
00:45:01.310 --> 00:45:02.250
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

919
00:45:02.300 --> 00:45:03.960
<v Speaker 3>The st louis side,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the blue side.</v>

920
00:45:03.980 --> 00:45:04.950
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

921
00:45:05.010 --> 00:45:05.910
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in fact,</v>

922
00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:10.920
<v Speaker 3>matthew matthew was the last one to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>in on this program and because we ran </v>

923
00:45:12.991 --> 00:45:14.480
<v Speaker 3>out of funds and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

924
00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:19.640
<v Speaker 3>we did a radio show a couple of weeks </v>
<v Speaker 3>ago and one of my patients calls and </v>

925
00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:21.450
<v Speaker 3>offers US the money to get the system </v>
<v Speaker 3>back up and running.</v>

926
00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:24.750
<v Speaker 3>And last week when I was lecturing in </v>
<v Speaker 3>vegas,</v>

927
00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:30.000
<v Speaker 3>I'm approached by someone who had put in</v>
<v Speaker 3>a grant with deal with the dod,</v>

928
00:45:30.001 --> 00:45:33.480
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doctors and get a patty and dr dash at a</v>

929
00:45:33.481 --> 00:45:38.481
<v Speaker 3>university test of Texas who are now </v>
<v Speaker 3>helping me to apply for a dod grant so </v>

930
00:45:39.091 --> 00:45:41.400
<v Speaker 3>that I can continue doing the work that </v>
<v Speaker 3>we've been doing.</v>

931
00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:44.050
<v Speaker 3>I'm still taking money out of my pocket.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

932
00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:49.280
<v Speaker 3>the lab is still providing us With the </v>
<v Speaker 3>funds so that we can have a trickle of </v>

933
00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:53.961
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but before we get 10 people at a time </v>

934
00:45:53.961 --> 00:45:56.440
<v Speaker 3>and they've all gotten better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just not a lot of people that are </v>

935
00:45:56.440 --> 00:45:58.250
<v Speaker 3>talking about this though in the sense </v>
<v Speaker 3>that the way you're talking about it,</v>

936
00:45:58.251 --> 00:46:03.251
<v Speaker 3>like did you see the hbo real sports </v>
<v Speaker 3>piece on traumatic brain injury in </v>

937
00:46:03.251 --> 00:46:03.251
<v Speaker 3>football players?</v>

938
00:46:03.251 --> 00:46:03.800
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well you're,</v>

939
00:46:03.810 --> 00:46:07.940
<v Speaker 3>you're seizing all these pieces on these</v>
<v Speaker 3>guys that have all these issues,</v>

940
00:46:08.210 --> 00:46:13.210
<v Speaker 3>but what you eat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well they know what they're saying </v>

941
00:46:13.210 --> 00:46:15.491
<v Speaker 3>essentially is we have to be careful </v>
<v Speaker 3>with the amount of damage these guys </v>

942
00:46:15.491 --> 00:46:18.641
<v Speaker 3>take and football and there's gotta be </v>
<v Speaker 3>some sort of methods in place to </v>

943
00:46:18.641 --> 00:46:22.370
<v Speaker 3>mitigate this or at least to monitor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like put sensors on the helmets,</v>

944
00:46:22.690 --> 00:46:27.690
<v Speaker 3>but they're not talking about hormones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not talking about an another </v>

945
00:46:27.690 --> 00:46:31.301
<v Speaker 3>avenue of treatment that is based upon </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing the right testing to see what the </v>

946
00:46:31.301 --> 00:46:35.021
<v Speaker 3>problem is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not doing the testing to find </v>

947
00:46:35.021 --> 00:46:35.021
<v Speaker 3>the hormone deficiency.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Defining,</v>

948
00:46:35.021 --> 00:46:38.841
<v Speaker 3>finding brain damage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're finding you're going to find </v>

949
00:46:38.841 --> 00:46:40.280
<v Speaker 3>dte,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the encephalopathy from trauma.</v>

950
00:46:40.310 --> 00:46:44.120
<v Speaker 3>You're going to find that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what the literature is I referred to</v>

951
00:46:44.121 --> 00:46:47.540
<v Speaker 3>earlier is showing us that we can </v>
<v Speaker 3>regenerate neurons.</v>

952
00:46:47.780 --> 00:46:51.110
<v Speaker 3>It's been done,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can heal the brain.</v>

953
00:46:51.410 --> 00:46:54.560
<v Speaker 3>And the piece that came out in life </v>
<v Speaker 3>extension magazine a couple years ago,</v>

954
00:46:54.850 --> 00:46:56.840
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they interviewed me for this thing about</v>

955
00:46:56.841 --> 00:47:00.950
<v Speaker 3>healing the brain with hormones is </v>
<v Speaker 3>happening and healing the brain,</v>

956
00:47:00.951 --> 00:47:05.951
<v Speaker 3>regenerate neurons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like how has that done and what's the </v>

957
00:47:05.951 --> 00:47:05.951
<v Speaker 3>process involved?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

958
00:47:05.951 --> 00:47:09.320
<v Speaker 3>it was my three hour lecture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'll make it as short as I can,</v>

959
00:47:10.730 --> 00:47:14.630
<v Speaker 3>having head trauma.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It initiates a group of inflammation,</v>

960
00:47:14.720 --> 00:47:17.660
<v Speaker 3>inflammatory cascades in the brain that </v>
<v Speaker 3>have,</v>

961
00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:22.370
<v Speaker 3>that changed the chemistry of the brain </v>
<v Speaker 3>so that the natural ability of the brain</v>

962
00:47:22.371 --> 00:47:27.371
<v Speaker 3>to regenerate nerves is lost.</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're finding that thyroid hormone,</v>

963
00:47:27.491 --> 00:47:30.850
<v Speaker 3>specifically thyroid three trial to </v>
<v Speaker 3>directing,</v>

964
00:47:31.180 --> 00:47:34.300
<v Speaker 3>is extremely important to help stem </v>
<v Speaker 3>cells in the brain,</v>

965
00:47:34.301 --> 00:47:35.410
<v Speaker 3>which they just found,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

966
00:47:35.470 --> 00:47:40.470
<v Speaker 3>recently in the past 10 years that we </v>
<v Speaker 3>have stem cells left in the brain that </v>

967
00:47:40.470 --> 00:47:42.490
<v Speaker 3>could regenerate the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>so when you're thyroid deficient,</v>

968
00:47:42.491 --> 00:47:47.491
<v Speaker 3>what happens is the cells lose their </v>
<v Speaker 3>ability to stimulate growth factors for </v>

969
00:47:47.491 --> 00:47:47.800
<v Speaker 3>nerve regeneration.</v>

970
00:47:48.460 --> 00:47:52.570
<v Speaker 3>And so having all the hormones back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>removing the trump,</v>

971
00:47:52.630 --> 00:47:57.630
<v Speaker 3>the inflammatory processes in the brain </v>
<v Speaker 3>can foster a neuro permissive </v>

972
00:47:58.180 --> 00:48:02.200
<v Speaker 3>environment with the nerves will grow </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the sciences there,</v>

973
00:48:02.260 --> 00:48:07.260
<v Speaker 3>they showing the things that stop the </v>
<v Speaker 3>things that stimulated and in head </v>

974
00:48:07.260 --> 00:48:07.270
<v Speaker 3>trauma,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the not have been testing it because the</v>

975
00:48:07.271 --> 00:48:09.880
<v Speaker 3>difficulty is in order to know what's </v>
<v Speaker 3>going on in the brain,</v>

976
00:48:09.881 --> 00:48:13.610
<v Speaker 3>you have to take a brain biopsy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'd been trying to get a markers.</v>

977
00:48:14.250 --> 00:48:17.170
<v Speaker 3>s 100 is one of the markets they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>working with right now.</v>

978
00:48:17.350 --> 00:48:19.630
<v Speaker 3>That just tells you that it's happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

979
00:48:19.631 --> 00:48:24.340
<v Speaker 3>we're doing so phenomenal at diagnosing </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you have traumatic brain injury and</v>

980
00:48:24.341 --> 00:48:27.550
<v Speaker 3>seeing it on one of the neuro </v>
<v Speaker 3>radiological techniques,</v>

981
00:48:27.551 --> 00:48:32.260
<v Speaker 3>but they're failing in treatment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What about the connective tissue between</v>

982
00:48:32.261 --> 00:48:34.870
<v Speaker 3>the brain and the skull itself?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

983
00:48:34.871 --> 00:48:39.871
<v Speaker 3>isn't that an issue with boxers and </v>
<v Speaker 3>fighters that have had repeated trauma </v>

984
00:48:39.871 --> 00:48:41.850
<v Speaker 3>to see the connective tissue gets </v>
<v Speaker 3>damaged?</v>

985
00:48:41.860 --> 00:48:46.860
<v Speaker 3>What happens is subdural hematoma,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a bleed between the pia mater </v>

986
00:48:46.860 --> 00:48:48.310
<v Speaker 3>in the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then there's intra,</v>

987
00:48:48.340 --> 00:48:50.410
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cerebral bleeding that occurs.</v>

988
00:48:50.500 --> 00:48:55.500
<v Speaker 3>And what happens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the cause for loss of consciousness is </v>

989
00:48:55.500 --> 00:49:00.331
<v Speaker 3>because you've torn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've shared is what they call an </v>

990
00:49:00.331 --> 00:49:03.881
<v Speaker 3>shearing or too few secs o'neil trauma.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've broken the long nerves that </v>

991
00:49:04.691 --> 00:49:09.691
<v Speaker 3>connect everything to keep you </v>
<v Speaker 3>stimulated to be awake and through this </v>

992
00:49:09.790 --> 00:49:14.790
<v Speaker 3>process called an mri or a dtm mri,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can actually see a where nerves have</v>

993
00:49:15.881 --> 00:49:18.670
<v Speaker 3>broken and when you break them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's when you lose consciousness.</v>

994
00:49:19.300 --> 00:49:24.300
<v Speaker 3>And so we can detect it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can not regenerate those directly,</v>

995
00:49:24.371 --> 00:49:27.910
<v Speaker 3>but we can build secondary pathways and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what they're finding.</v>

996
00:49:27.911 --> 00:49:31.340
<v Speaker 3>There's a chemical called nogo a and o,</v>
<v Speaker 3>g o a,</v>

997
00:49:31.630 --> 00:49:35.680
<v Speaker 3>which actually inhibits the ability of </v>
<v Speaker 3>nerves to regenerate.</v>

998
00:49:35.890 --> 00:49:38.740
<v Speaker 3>And it's by controlling the environment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

999
00:49:38.741 --> 00:49:43.741
<v Speaker 3>using ivy gludethyon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>using some of the products that we have </v>

1000
00:49:43.741 --> 00:49:48.000
<v Speaker 3>that can allow the brain to have an a </v>
<v Speaker 3>environment and environment where it can</v>

1001
00:49:48.881 --> 00:49:49.450
<v Speaker 3>regenerate.</v>

1002
00:49:50.560 --> 00:49:51.910
<v Speaker 3>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1003
00:49:51.940 --> 00:49:56.940
<v Speaker 3>the trauma to the brain itself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the nerves that get damaged will never </v>

1004
00:49:57.161 --> 00:50:02.161
<v Speaker 3>be replaced.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the secondary pathways that are </v>

1005
00:50:02.161 --> 00:50:04.801
<v Speaker 3>created to in response to that damage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can they put someone back to the same </v>

1006
00:50:05.651 --> 00:50:08.200
<v Speaker 3>state that they were at?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Will they always be diminished?</v>

1007
00:50:08.680 --> 00:50:10.730
<v Speaker 3>Like say you're talking about a guy like</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1008
00:50:10.860 --> 00:50:15.860
<v Speaker 3>an unnamed mma champion who at the end </v>
<v Speaker 3>of his career starts getting knocked out</v>

1009
00:50:15.941 --> 00:50:20.941
<v Speaker 3>a bunch of times and we see that with </v>
<v Speaker 3>guys who used to be able to take </v>

1010
00:50:20.941 --> 00:50:22.360
<v Speaker 3>tremendous punches and now all of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>sudden they get hit and they just go.</v>

1011
00:50:22.570 --> 00:50:27.570
<v Speaker 3>Is that because of all those nerve </v>
<v Speaker 3>breaks that have happened over the </v>

1012
00:50:27.570 --> 00:50:28.040
<v Speaker 3>course of their career and the secondary</v>

1013
00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:33.040
<v Speaker 2>pathways just simply inadequate or is </v>
<v Speaker 2>there another response going on where </v>

1014
00:50:33.040 --> 00:50:36.080
<v Speaker 2>the mind is protecting itself?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what I've heard described to me.</v>

1015
00:50:36.410 --> 00:50:40.370
<v Speaker 2>They're shutting off quicker because the</v>
<v Speaker 2>mind has recognized this pattern,</v>

1016
00:50:40.520 --> 00:50:42.110
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're receiving trauma.</v>

1017
00:50:42.230 --> 00:50:45.500
<v Speaker 2>The best way to do to mitigate this is </v>
<v Speaker 2>just shut off.</v>

1018
00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:50.270
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a simplified version of it.</v>

1019
00:50:50.440 --> 00:50:55.160
<v Speaker 3>I'm not to make it too deep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but their tolerance has changed.</v>

1020
00:50:55.400 --> 00:51:00.400
<v Speaker 3>We're in the past,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have a regenerative capacity or </v>

1021
00:51:00.400 --> 00:51:03.950
<v Speaker 3>they have endogenous system inside that </v>
<v Speaker 3>can help to keep things in balance.</v>

1022
00:51:03.951 --> 00:51:08.360
<v Speaker 3>When you've lost the ability of this </v>
<v Speaker 3>automated system to control things,</v>

1023
00:51:08.960 --> 00:51:11.510
<v Speaker 3>you pass out whether or not it's the </v>
<v Speaker 3>vascular.</v>

1024
00:51:11.511 --> 00:51:12.800
<v Speaker 3>You're more sensitive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Vascular,</v>

1025
00:51:12.801 --> 00:51:17.801
<v Speaker 3>so on the head trauma,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the blood shunts from one area to </v>

1026
00:51:17.801 --> 00:51:21.341
<v Speaker 3>another,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you lose the blood that keeps you </v>

1027
00:51:21.341 --> 00:51:21.341
<v Speaker 3>awake and you pass out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1028
00:51:21.341 --> 00:51:23.180
<v Speaker 3>neurologicAlly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

1029
00:51:23.181 --> 00:51:27.680
<v Speaker 3>they could be breaking more nerves and </v>
<v Speaker 3>therefore I'm losing it more readily.</v>

1030
00:51:28.010 --> 00:51:33.010
<v Speaker 3>It's about resilience tolerance and how </v>
<v Speaker 3>much of that you've lost.</v>

1031
00:51:33.650 --> 00:51:36.800
<v Speaker 3>So you no longer have $100,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>in your bank account.</v>

1032
00:51:36.801 --> 00:51:41.801
<v Speaker 3>You got a penny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when you buy that piece of gum that </v>

1033
00:51:41.801 --> 00:51:41.801
<v Speaker 3>you can't buy you your empty.</v>

1034
00:51:41.950 --> 00:51:46.950
<v Speaker 2>So any shot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's what we just shot a shot </v>

1035
00:51:46.950 --> 00:51:50.311
<v Speaker 2>to the head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just start going and that doesn't </v>

1036
00:51:50.311 --> 00:51:50.311
<v Speaker 2>get fixed.</v>

1037
00:51:50.311 --> 00:51:53.520
<v Speaker 3>correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can't answer whether it gets fixed or </v>

1038
00:51:53.520 --> 00:51:55.480
<v Speaker 3>not because it depends on the individual</v>
<v Speaker 3>individual looking at their hormonal.</v>

1039
00:51:55.481 --> 00:51:59.120
<v Speaker 3>May lou looking at anything else that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>a cold morbidity,</v>

1040
00:51:59.240 --> 00:52:02.590
<v Speaker 3>things that are predisposing them to </v>
<v Speaker 3>have a more sensitive response to it.</v>

1041
00:52:03.140 --> 00:52:03.820
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1042
00:52:03.970 --> 00:52:05.530
<v Speaker 3>certain drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>alcohol,</v>

1043
00:52:05.740 --> 00:52:09.350
<v Speaker 3>I mean a lot of the drugs that we use,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is one drug that's used a lot,</v>

1044
00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:14.360
<v Speaker 3>I won't say the name,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but deals with cholesterol that doesn't </v>

1045
00:52:14.360 --> 00:52:16.170
<v Speaker 3>allow cells to regenerate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Also wax your vitamin d and your co q 10</v>

1046
00:52:17.080 --> 00:52:22.080
<v Speaker 2>when something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't say the name because I want to </v>

1047
00:52:22.080 --> 00:52:25.421
<v Speaker 2>get sued.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't want the fucking evil army </v>

1048
00:52:25.421 --> 00:52:25.421
<v Speaker 2>comIng after them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1049
00:52:25.421 --> 00:52:27.680
<v Speaker 2>there are articles showing that to know </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the cells</v>

1050
00:52:27.820 --> 00:52:32.820
<v Speaker 3>breakdown more readily and there's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>process for processes in the brain which</v>

1051
00:52:32.870 --> 00:52:37.240
<v Speaker 3>regulate a nerves staying strong and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then being destroyed by.</v>

1052
00:52:37.490 --> 00:52:41.590
<v Speaker 2>So anyone who's on those kinds of drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like anti cholesterol drugs,</v>

1053
00:52:41.940 --> 00:52:44.690
<v Speaker 2>they're risking a lot of damage to their</v>
<v Speaker 2>body.</v>

1054
00:52:45.320 --> 00:52:49.400
<v Speaker 2>There are multitude of levels you shut </v>
<v Speaker 2>off because I have a friend who's on it.</v>

1055
00:52:49.520 --> 00:52:50.690
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anthony bourdain's on it.</v>

1056
00:52:51.310 --> 00:52:51.980
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1057
00:52:51.981 --> 00:52:56.981
<v Speaker 2>and he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's on it because he won't stop eating </v>

1058
00:52:56.981 --> 00:52:56.981
<v Speaker 2>pork.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it kosher?</v>

1059
00:52:56.981 --> 00:52:58.190
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe he's jewish.</v>

1060
00:52:58.470 --> 00:53:01.400
<v Speaker 2>He may be the port kosher.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously he isn't,</v>

1061
00:53:01.620 --> 00:53:03.000
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dad's french,</v>

1062
00:53:03.020 --> 00:53:05.090
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It could be jewish.</v>

1063
00:53:05.091 --> 00:53:05.880
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he was a.</v>

1064
00:53:06.110 --> 00:53:07.500
<v Speaker 2>Well he's not religious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he,</v>

1065
00:53:07.510 --> 00:53:08.990
<v Speaker 2>the Libya.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it doesn't matter.</v>

1066
00:53:08.991 --> 00:53:10.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But my point is he's,</v>

1067
00:53:10.580 --> 00:53:15.580
<v Speaker 2>he's taking this just because he doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>want to do anything to reduce his </v>

1068
00:53:15.580 --> 00:53:17.720
<v Speaker 2>cholesterol because he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he enjoys fatty.</v>

1069
00:53:17.721 --> 00:53:20.780
<v Speaker 2>Awesome food and enjoy it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that shit is not good.</v>

1070
00:53:20.781 --> 00:53:21.300
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1071
00:53:22.080 --> 00:53:27.080
<v Speaker 3>so if cocuten vitamin d in one of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>chapters of the new book where I talk </v>

1072
00:53:27.751 --> 00:53:28.830
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1073
00:53:29.070 --> 00:53:31.860
<v Speaker 3>treatment for hormonal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the first case that I presented as a guy</v>

1074
00:53:31.861 --> 00:53:36.861
<v Speaker 3>who came in to me who was on one of </v>
<v Speaker 3>those cholesterol lowering drugs and </v>

1075
00:53:36.861 --> 00:53:40.401
<v Speaker 3>his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all his hormones were down because </v>

1076
00:53:40.401 --> 00:53:43.221
<v Speaker 3>cholesterol is the precursor to all our </v>
<v Speaker 3>hormones are androgens and estrogens.</v>

1077
00:53:44.190 --> 00:53:46.680
<v Speaker 3>So cortisol,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cortisol,</v>

1078
00:53:46.681 --> 00:53:48.120
<v Speaker 3>pregnenolone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>testosterone,</v>

1079
00:53:48.121 --> 00:53:48.840
<v Speaker 3>estrone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>island,</v>

1080
00:53:48.841 --> 00:53:51.840
<v Speaker 3>dht and dah da.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they were all reduced.</v>

1081
00:53:51.930 --> 00:53:55.380
<v Speaker 3>all we did is stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is staten drug and it all came up.</v>

1082
00:53:55.381 --> 00:53:59.550
<v Speaker 3>I didn't have to do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what do you do to reduce cholesterol</v>

1083
00:53:59.551 --> 00:54:01.770
<v Speaker 3>other than diet?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like for a guy like that?</v>

1084
00:54:01.800 --> 00:54:04.860
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>opens up nice,</v>

1085
00:54:04.861 --> 00:54:08.040
<v Speaker 3>warm the box of worms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The question is,</v>

1086
00:54:08.100 --> 00:54:12.390
<v Speaker 3>is cholesterol really the issue?</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you look at the statistics,</v>

1087
00:54:12.391 --> 00:54:17.391
<v Speaker 3>50 percent of all heart attacks happen </v>
<v Speaker 3>in people with low or normal levels of </v>

1088
00:54:17.391 --> 00:54:17.391
<v Speaker 3>cholesterol.</v>

1089
00:54:17.391 --> 00:54:19.980
<v Speaker 3>So the question that any intelligent </v>
<v Speaker 3>person has to ask,</v>

1090
00:54:20.400 --> 00:54:24.120
<v Speaker 3>excluding myself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that I'm than what's causing it?</v>

1091
00:54:24.150 --> 00:54:26.970
<v Speaker 3>How did these people get heart attacks?</v>
<v Speaker 3>if the cholesterol is normal or low,</v>

1092
00:54:27.570 --> 00:54:32.100
<v Speaker 3>why don't die of a heart attack with my </v>
<v Speaker 3>cholesterol between 75 and 3:49,</v>

1093
00:54:32.160 --> 00:54:37.160
<v Speaker 3>and my ultrafast ct scan that looked at </v>
<v Speaker 3>my coronary arteries were perfectly </v>

1094
00:54:37.160 --> 00:54:37.770
<v Speaker 3>clear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>how is it that when my best buddies,</v>

1095
00:54:37.771 --> 00:54:40.030
<v Speaker 3>who's a fighter pilot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1096
00:54:40.080 --> 00:54:42.060
<v Speaker 3>has a cholesterol 1:40</v>
<v Speaker 3>to 1:50</v>

1097
00:54:42.090 --> 00:54:47.090
<v Speaker 3>and he ended up having open heart </v>
<v Speaker 3>surgery because his cholesterol is </v>

1098
00:54:47.090 --> 00:54:49.560
<v Speaker 3>calcium count was greater than 2000.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mine was zero.</v>

1099
00:54:49.590 --> 00:54:51.840
<v Speaker 3>His was greater than 2000,</v>
<v Speaker 3>less than 100.</v>

1100
00:54:51.841 --> 00:54:53.370
<v Speaker 3>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Greater than 400 dangerous.</v>

1101
00:54:53.371 --> 00:54:58.371
<v Speaker 3>He was greater than 2000.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had 95 percent occlusion of the main </v>

1102
00:54:58.371 --> 00:55:02.781
<v Speaker 3>artery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The left anterior descending ends up </v>

1103
00:55:02.781 --> 00:55:03.810
<v Speaker 3>having open heart surgery and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hard to re replaced from his leg.</v>

1104
00:55:04.620 --> 00:55:05.460
<v Speaker 3>How do you account for it?</v>

1105
00:55:05.460 --> 00:55:10.460
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we went back and we did a series of </v>

1106
00:55:10.460 --> 00:55:10.460
<v Speaker 3>tests which were gifted by this </v>
<v Speaker 3>laboratory.</v>

1107
00:55:10.460 --> 00:55:14.701
<v Speaker 3>I work within Florida,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which called the [inaudible] that looks </v>

1108
00:55:14.701 --> 00:55:17.721
<v Speaker 3>at the inflammatory markers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>inflammation markers that lead to heart </v>

1109
00:55:17.721 --> 00:55:18.950
<v Speaker 3>disease.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So something called pla.</v>

1110
00:55:18.951 --> 00:55:21.120
<v Speaker 3>See small density,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ldl,</v>

1111
00:55:21.121 --> 00:55:22.830
<v Speaker 3>homocysteine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>c reactive protein.</v>

1112
00:55:22.831 --> 00:55:27.831
<v Speaker 3>There's a whole group of chemistry that </v>
<v Speaker 3>causes inflammation to lead to the </v>

1113
00:55:27.831 --> 00:55:31.500
<v Speaker 3>hardening of the arteries in the body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>responds by putting calcium down.</v>

1114
00:55:31.501 --> 00:55:35.340
<v Speaker 3>That's the atherosclerotic lesions to </v>
<v Speaker 3>try and work like a bandaid.</v>

1115
00:55:35.910 --> 00:55:36.810
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1116
00:55:37.170 --> 00:55:39.540
<v Speaker 3>what spinoff that you've heard of </v>
<v Speaker 3>culation therapy?</v>

1117
00:55:39.750 --> 00:55:41.850
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>culation therapy for many years has been</v>

1118
00:55:41.851 --> 00:55:44.400
<v Speaker 3>pooh poohed by medical community.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In three years ago,</v>

1119
00:55:44.401 --> 00:55:46.170
<v Speaker 3>the federal government did a study and </v>
<v Speaker 3>what did they say?</v>

1120
00:55:46.380 --> 00:55:49.830
<v Speaker 3>Culation therapy works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is culation therapy relationship is</v>

1121
00:55:49.880 --> 00:55:53.010
<v Speaker 3>a two levels of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One is to remove all the toxins from the</v>

1122
00:55:53.011 --> 00:55:58.011
<v Speaker 3>body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Our focus was to try and remove the </v>

1123
00:55:58.011 --> 00:56:00.651
<v Speaker 3>castle calcium deposition of in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>arteries and use calcium edta,</v>

1124
00:56:00.850 --> 00:56:05.850
<v Speaker 3>sodium edta,</v>
<v Speaker 3>festival title coleen chemicals that </v>

1125
00:56:05.850 --> 00:56:05.850
<v Speaker 3>remove it.</v>

1126
00:56:05.850 --> 00:56:05.850
<v Speaker 3>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

1127
00:56:05.850 --> 00:56:08.430
<v Speaker 3>another product which is called k one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two,</v>

1128
00:56:08.431 --> 00:56:09.270
<v Speaker 3>three,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and seven,</v>

1129
00:56:09.600 --> 00:56:14.600
<v Speaker 3>which helped to remove calcium </v>
<v Speaker 3>deposition from the lining of the </v>

1130
00:56:14.600 --> 00:56:15.690
<v Speaker 3>arteries.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you can remove the calcification,</v>

1131
00:56:15.691 --> 00:56:20.430
<v Speaker 3>you improve the atherosclerotic lesions </v>
<v Speaker 3>that narrowed the blood vessels and lead</v>

1132
00:56:20.431 --> 00:56:23.710
<v Speaker 3>spasming and inflammation that calls and</v>
<v Speaker 3>cholesterol.</v>

1133
00:56:23.770 --> 00:56:28.770
<v Speaker 3>Cholesterol is has two major functions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One is to supply the cells with the </v>

1134
00:56:28.770 --> 00:56:33.260
<v Speaker 3>precursor to all our hormones except </v>
<v Speaker 3>growth hormone and so forth and thyroid </v>

1135
00:56:33.260 --> 00:56:37.950
<v Speaker 3>and all the sex hormones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and also to repair the wall of the </v>

1136
00:56:38.291 --> 00:56:43.291
<v Speaker 3>arteries and studies that were done </v>
<v Speaker 3>where they took a whole bunch of stuff </v>

1137
00:56:43.291 --> 00:56:43.630
<v Speaker 3>like trans fatty acids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nicotine,</v>

1138
00:56:43.870 --> 00:56:45.400
<v Speaker 3>sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uric acid,</v>

1139
00:56:45.401 --> 00:56:46.570
<v Speaker 3>cholesterol,</v>
<v Speaker 3>c,</v>

1140
00:56:46.571 --> 00:56:48.350
<v Speaker 3>reactive protein,</v>
<v Speaker 3>testosterone,</v>

1141
00:56:48.400 --> 00:56:51.280
<v Speaker 3>estrogen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They put it in cultures of the lining of</v>

1142
00:56:51.281 --> 00:56:56.281
<v Speaker 3>the arteries called endothelia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The only one that didn't cause </v>

1143
00:56:56.281 --> 00:56:58.210
<v Speaker 3>inflammation was cholesterol.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1144
00:56:58.390 --> 00:57:00.910
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then a lot of articles you know that</v>

1145
00:57:00.911 --> 00:57:04.120
<v Speaker 3>talk about this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the myth of a cholesterol myth,</v>

1146
00:57:04.121 --> 00:57:09.121
<v Speaker 3>and that's what I see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Otherwise I have hardening of the </v>

1147
00:57:09.121 --> 00:57:10.990
<v Speaker 3>arteries,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but my genetics on this panel that we do</v>

1148
00:57:10.991 --> 00:57:14.230
<v Speaker 3>an lp six,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all my inflammatory markers are low.</v>

1149
00:57:14.320 --> 00:57:18.760
<v Speaker 3>My cholesterol is high in keith.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His inflammatory markers are high,</v>

1150
00:57:18.910 --> 00:57:20.110
<v Speaker 3>but with low cholesterol.</v>

1151
00:57:20.650 --> 00:57:25.650
<v Speaker 6>And so is this just a legacy?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Diagnosis is just something that we've </v>

1152
00:57:25.781 --> 00:57:29.050
<v Speaker 6>said for so many years.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The cholesterol causes heart attacks and</v>

1153
00:57:29.290 --> 00:57:34.290
<v Speaker 6>it just imprinted in our brains.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I do remember when people say sodium </v>

1154
00:57:34.290 --> 00:57:37.100
<v Speaker 6>causes high blood pressure,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but if you have no fucking salts,</v>

1155
00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:38.090
<v Speaker 6>a mineral,</v>
<v Speaker 6>goddammit,</v>

1156
00:57:38.110 --> 00:57:40.060
<v Speaker 6>it's an important part of your body like</v>
<v Speaker 6>you.</v>

1157
00:57:40.061 --> 00:57:42.010
<v Speaker 6>You need salt,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you need certain amount of it.</v>

1158
00:57:42.060 --> 00:57:47.060
<v Speaker 3>Correct,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think they're making generic </v>

1159
00:57:47.060 --> 00:57:49.701
<v Speaker 3>statements where they're selective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It should be selective in certain </v>

1160
00:57:49.701 --> 00:57:50.580
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sodium might be bad in certain people.</v>

1161
00:57:50.581 --> 00:57:53.100
<v Speaker 3>Cholesterol might might be bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't see it</v>

1162
00:57:53.230 --> 00:57:58.230
<v Speaker 6>wasn't that sodium.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The whole diagnosis of sodium causing </v>

1163
00:57:58.230 --> 00:58:02.911
<v Speaker 6>all these health problems.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Wasn't that like inherently flawed in </v>

1164
00:58:02.911 --> 00:58:02.911
<v Speaker 6>the first place?</v>

1165
00:58:02.911 --> 00:58:03.490
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What was that?</v>

1166
00:58:03.520 --> 00:58:06.160
<v Speaker 3>Did you remember what it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>specifically,</v>

1167
00:58:06.161 --> 00:58:10.900
<v Speaker 3>but they were saying that overload of </v>
<v Speaker 3>salt in certain racial groups.</v>

1168
00:58:10.901 --> 00:58:11.820
<v Speaker 3>Can I say that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1169
00:58:11.821 --> 00:58:13.900
<v Speaker 3>You don't say the blacks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1170
00:58:13.901 --> 00:58:15.190
<v Speaker 3>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then I won't say that.</v>

1171
00:58:15.220 --> 00:58:20.220
<v Speaker 3>I'll say in certain racial groups </v>
<v Speaker 3>they've always been known to be more </v>

1172
00:58:20.220 --> 00:58:23.671
<v Speaker 3>susceptible to a kidney related issues </v>
<v Speaker 3>and fluid retention on sodium,</v>

1173
00:58:24.310 --> 00:58:27.580
<v Speaker 3>so it predisposes them to enlargement of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the heart,</v>

1174
00:58:27.581 --> 00:58:30.700
<v Speaker 3>congestive heart failure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fluid retention in high blood pressure.</v>

1175
00:58:31.060 --> 00:58:36.060
<v Speaker 3>So in treating certain racial groups,</v>
<v Speaker 3>use diuretics that make you go pee to </v>

1176
00:58:36.060 --> 00:58:41.041
<v Speaker 3>lose the fluid and the blood and other </v>
<v Speaker 3>groups use beta blockers to relax the </v>

1177
00:58:41.041 --> 00:58:45.450
<v Speaker 3>contraction of the heart,</v>
<v Speaker 3>other ones to stretched the blood </v>

1178
00:58:45.450 --> 00:58:46.690
<v Speaker 3>vessels and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So every,</v>

1179
00:58:46.910 --> 00:58:51.910
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>genetic predisposition has a specific </v>

1180
00:58:51.910 --> 00:58:54.250
<v Speaker 3>kind of medication that works best.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you can't ubiquitously say,</v>

1181
00:58:54.251 --> 00:58:55.780
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody needs a stat and drug.</v>

1182
00:58:55.781 --> 00:58:58.540
<v Speaker 3>Everybody needs water pill,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody needs a beta blocker.</v>

1183
00:58:58.930 --> 00:59:03.930
<v Speaker 3>You have to be very selective and this </v>
<v Speaker 3>is what's being lost as matthew </v>

1184
00:59:03.930 --> 00:59:06.310
<v Speaker 3>experience in his experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You walk in wiTh any of his symptoms and</v>

1185
00:59:06.311 --> 00:59:11.311
<v Speaker 3>everybody gets on a prepaid prepaid </v>
<v Speaker 3>package of medication instead of </v>

1186
00:59:11.311 --> 00:59:14.470
<v Speaker 3>individualizing what he needs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just needed a blood test,</v>

1187
00:59:14.820 --> 00:59:19.820
<v Speaker 3>a $179 blood test to look at just his </v>
<v Speaker 3>testosterone related issues and find out</v>

1188
00:59:20.591 --> 00:59:22.160
<v Speaker 3>he was deficient and replace</v>

1189
00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:22.840
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Any.</v>

1190
00:59:22.940 --> 00:59:25.040
<v Speaker 4>Are you still on your medication?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Any medication?</v>

1191
00:59:26.030 --> 00:59:31.030
<v Speaker 4>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're on off everything you go through </v>

1192
00:59:31.030 --> 00:59:33.410
<v Speaker 4>withdrawal will that morphine and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure it's been awhile,</v>

1193
00:59:33.560 --> 00:59:37.160
<v Speaker 4>but I know I still take oxycodone and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they come down to um,</v>

1194
00:59:37.880 --> 00:59:40.060
<v Speaker 4>between two and three pills a day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's five,</v>

1195
00:59:40.110 --> 00:59:40.850
<v Speaker 4>three,</v>
<v Speaker 4>25.</v>

1196
00:59:41.660 --> 00:59:44.230
<v Speaker 4>How many were you on at the peak?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Eight a day.</v>

1197
00:59:44.260 --> 00:59:45.880
<v Speaker 4>A day to day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's with morphie?</v>

1198
00:59:46.380 --> 00:59:48.410
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was on four day.</v>

1199
00:59:48.411 --> 00:59:51.530
<v Speaker 4>And then you're still taking oxycodone </v>
<v Speaker 4>for pain?</v>

1200
00:59:51.740 --> 00:59:52.370
<v Speaker 4>I do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1201
00:59:52.460 --> 00:59:53.080
<v Speaker 4>And what is the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

1202
00:59:53.210 --> 00:59:55.250
<v Speaker 4>what is causing your pain?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1203
00:59:55.640 --> 00:59:57.020
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my gunshot wound in my leg,</v>

1204
00:59:57.021 --> 00:59:58.700
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>developed compartment syndrome in there.</v>

1205
00:59:59.180 --> 01:00:04.180
<v Speaker 4>So essentially I guess the easiest way </v>
<v Speaker 4>to describe that as the blood goes into </v>

1206
01:00:04.851 --> 01:00:06.620
<v Speaker 4>the tissue,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't have anywhere to go.</v>

1207
01:00:06.650 --> 01:00:09.500
<v Speaker 4>So the pressure builds up and it starts </v>
<v Speaker 4>breaking down muscle,</v>

1208
01:00:09.980 --> 01:00:11.930
<v Speaker 4>a muscle tissue and it's painful.</v>

1209
01:00:12.270 --> 01:00:16.010
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have six titanium bolts in my jaw from</v>

1210
01:00:16.011 --> 01:00:21.011
<v Speaker 4>one of the explosion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I have a lot of joint issues and I </v>

1211
01:00:21.011 --> 01:00:21.650
<v Speaker 4>took shrapnel in the side by my ear </v>
<v Speaker 4>canal.</v>

1212
01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:24.320
<v Speaker 4>So I just have joint pain from all the </v>
<v Speaker 4>movement.</v>

1213
01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:27.050
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1214
01:00:27.051 --> 01:00:28.730
<v Speaker 4>just stuff like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's not,</v>

1215
01:00:28.790 --> 01:00:31.460
<v Speaker 4>I'm not near where I was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I have arthritis,</v>

1216
01:00:31.461 --> 01:00:33.110
<v Speaker 4>things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1217
01:00:33.890 --> 01:00:37.190
<v Speaker 4>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I think I was on fentanyl 25.</v>

1218
01:00:37.250 --> 01:00:38.900
<v Speaker 4>Was it micrograms I think is what it </v>
<v Speaker 4>was.</v>

1219
01:00:38.901 --> 01:00:43.901
<v Speaker 4>Twenty five milligrams every three days.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it was a patch of morphine and was </v>

1220
01:00:43.901 --> 01:00:48.791
<v Speaker 4>I'm 40 milligrams a day I believe </v>
<v Speaker 4>because I think they're 20 milligram </v>

1221
01:00:48.791 --> 01:00:49.070
<v Speaker 4>pills.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd have to remember that.</v>

1222
01:00:49.340 --> 01:00:52.940
<v Speaker 4>And then oxycodone was a five,</v>
<v Speaker 4>3:25</v>

1223
01:00:53.030 --> 01:00:57.500
<v Speaker 4>and I was on eight of those and then.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So now I'm down to no fentanyl,</v>

1224
01:00:57.501 --> 01:00:59.950
<v Speaker 4>no morphine and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just three.</v>

1225
01:01:00.020 --> 01:01:03.350
<v Speaker 4>Oxy was a day and it seems to me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I'm ignorant to this,</v>

1226
01:01:03.351 --> 01:01:08.351
<v Speaker 4>but that still seems like a lot of pain </v>
<v Speaker 4>medication for your body to absorb and </v>

1227
01:01:08.351 --> 01:01:08.870
<v Speaker 4>process is that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is a lot,</v>

1228
01:01:08.871 --> 01:01:13.871
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's got a detox and then you can go </v>

1229
01:01:13.871 --> 01:01:13.871
<v Speaker 4>through cold Turkey.</v>

1230
01:01:15.350 --> 01:01:20.350
<v Speaker 4>So I've been on um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the testosterone replacement a little </v>

1231
01:01:20.350 --> 01:01:24.791
<v Speaker 4>over three months and from there I went </v>
<v Speaker 4>from um,</v>

1232
01:01:25.610 --> 01:01:30.560
<v Speaker 4>I got off the fentanyl a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 4>before I started that because I just,</v>

1233
01:01:30.620 --> 01:01:32.960
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't function with that and </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's too,</v>

1234
01:01:33.620 --> 01:01:34.700
<v Speaker 4>too high.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not high,</v>

1235
01:01:34.701 --> 01:01:36.650
<v Speaker 4>but I didn't feel high because I was in </v>
<v Speaker 4>pain,</v>

1236
01:01:36.651 --> 01:01:40.970
<v Speaker 4>but I felt down like a suppressed </v>
<v Speaker 4>immunosuppressed I guess,</v>

1237
01:01:41.030 --> 01:01:46.030
<v Speaker 4>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I went off the morphine and then </v>

1238
01:01:46.030 --> 01:01:49.100
<v Speaker 4>within three months I went from eight </v>
<v Speaker 4>oxies down to three and so,</v>

1239
01:01:49.101 --> 01:01:52.310
<v Speaker 4>I mean it could be two or three,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just kind of depends how I am during the</v>

1240
01:01:52.310 --> 01:01:57.310
<v Speaker 4>day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I might take one in the morning when </v>

1241
01:01:57.310 --> 01:01:58.811
<v Speaker 4>I wake up and then maybe one at night.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And is the goal to eVentually eliminate </v>

1242
01:01:58.811 --> 01:01:59.210
<v Speaker 4>that completely?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1243
01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:04.360
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hopefully three months Is a pretty </v>

1244
01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:04.360
<v Speaker 4>significant improvement.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1245
01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:05.960
<v Speaker 4>that's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's such a short period of time.</v>

1246
01:02:05.961 --> 01:02:08.450
<v Speaker 4>That's the pain meds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's even the antidepressants,</v>

1247
01:02:08.540 --> 01:02:11.150
<v Speaker 4>anti anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's all this stuff.</v>

1248
01:02:11.180 --> 01:02:13.210
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the only thing that's left out of like a</v>

1249
01:02:13.430 --> 01:02:17.950
<v Speaker 4>12 medication panel is literally just </v>
<v Speaker 4>the three pain meds.</v>

1250
01:02:17.990 --> 01:02:18.980
<v Speaker 4>How,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how did it,</v>

1251
01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:22.760
<v Speaker 4>your relationship at home and you have </v>
<v Speaker 4>kids almost impersonal.</v>

1252
01:02:23.580 --> 01:02:26.940
<v Speaker 4>I mean this is what we got divorced.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that.</v>

1253
01:02:27.050 --> 01:02:28.400
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that end you have,</v>

1254
01:02:28.460 --> 01:02:30.180
<v Speaker 4>you have a couple kids,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1255
01:02:31.350 --> 01:02:32.310
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1256
01:02:33.330 --> 01:02:34.490
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I'm,</v>

1257
01:02:35.980 --> 01:02:37.060
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean we're divorced.</v>

1258
01:02:37.061 --> 01:02:38.980
<v Speaker 4>I mean I interact with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1259
01:02:39.310 --> 01:02:41.190
<v Speaker 4>with my ex every day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but</v>

1260
01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:42.370
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>

1261
01:02:43.460 --> 01:02:46.010
<v Speaker 4>I'm pretty sure she's got a bitter taste</v>
<v Speaker 4>left in her mouth.</v>

1262
01:02:46.070 --> 01:02:47.710
<v Speaker 4>But does it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1263
01:02:47.930 --> 01:02:49.820
<v Speaker 4>maybe that was the wrong way to phrase </v>
<v Speaker 4>the question,</v>

1264
01:02:49.850 --> 01:02:54.850
<v Speaker 4>how has it affected your ability to like</v>
<v Speaker 4>deal with day life stuff?</v>

1265
01:02:56.060 --> 01:02:57.560
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's much better.</v>

1266
01:02:57.561 --> 01:03:02.561
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's hard to even describe it because </v>

1267
01:03:02.561 --> 01:03:02.561
<v Speaker 4>it's so normal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1268
01:03:02.561 --> 01:03:03.590
<v Speaker 4>I feel so normal now to where it's not </v>
<v Speaker 4>an issue.</v>

1269
01:03:04.020 --> 01:03:04.560
<v Speaker 8>Um,</v>

1270
01:03:05.740 --> 01:03:10.510
<v Speaker 4>I mean I'm not having that issue of just</v>
<v Speaker 4>the biggest thing for me I think was um,</v>

1271
01:03:10.540 --> 01:03:13.930
<v Speaker 4>the ability to let go when things are </v>
<v Speaker 4>upsetting,</v>

1272
01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:18.960
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>little things that people everyday just </v>

1273
01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:18.960
<v Speaker 4>tap in this part of life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whereas for me,</v>

1274
01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:21.790
<v Speaker 4>it was end of the world and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to tear things down.</v>

1275
01:03:21.791 --> 01:03:23.320
<v Speaker 4>We're now at,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just kind of goes off.</v>

1276
01:03:23.660 --> 01:03:28.660
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my interactions with the ex have been </v>

1277
01:03:28.660 --> 01:03:28.660
<v Speaker 4>better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of hurt there.</v>

1278
01:03:28.660 --> 01:03:32.970
<v Speaker 4>So that comes out sometimes and on both </v>
<v Speaker 4>sides because a lot of mistakes were </v>

1279
01:03:34.361 --> 01:03:36.910
<v Speaker 4>made in anger or in pain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

1280
01:03:37.150 --> 01:03:39.970
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's for me right now,</v>

1281
01:03:40.270 --> 01:03:45.270
<v Speaker 4>the big thing is physically I'm getting </v>
<v Speaker 4>to where I want to be and I'm getting,</v>

1282
01:03:46.241 --> 01:03:46.750
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not,</v>

1283
01:03:46.900 --> 01:03:50.620
<v Speaker 4>I'm not 100 percent there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm 80 percent physically where,</v>

1284
01:03:50.621 --> 01:03:54.070
<v Speaker 4>where I want to be and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I still got a little ways to go.</v>

1285
01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:58.440
<v Speaker 4>Now the second half of that will be </v>
<v Speaker 4>working mentally tr,</v>

1286
01:03:58.510 --> 01:04:03.510
<v Speaker 4>trying to figure out what it is I need </v>
<v Speaker 4>to do to mentally get 100 percent </v>

1287
01:04:03.510 --> 01:04:04.060
<v Speaker 4>clarity of where,</v>

1288
01:04:04.360 --> 01:04:04.870
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>

1289
01:04:06.220 --> 01:04:11.220
<v Speaker 4>I can think is clearly as possible and </v>
<v Speaker 4>deal with any of the things that have </v>

1290
01:04:11.220 --> 01:04:14.581
<v Speaker 4>happened,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether a pre military military and </v>

1291
01:04:14.581 --> 01:04:17.731
<v Speaker 4>after.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it is going to be a challenge </v>

1292
01:04:17.731 --> 01:04:17.731
<v Speaker 4>because,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1293
01:04:17.731 --> 01:04:18.250
<v Speaker 4>I'm trying to heal broken relationships,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1294
01:04:18.251 --> 01:04:19.870
<v Speaker 4>my wife,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my ex and I,</v>

1295
01:04:19.871 --> 01:04:22.180
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she's with someone and very happy.</v>

1296
01:04:22.181 --> 01:04:23.860
<v Speaker 4>So does nothIng there.</v>

1297
01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:24.780
<v Speaker 8>Um,</v>

1298
01:04:25.510 --> 01:04:26.950
<v Speaker 4>I'll always love her.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1299
01:04:27.010 --> 01:04:30.400
<v Speaker 4>she was the only woman I've ever loved.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so that's there.</v>

1300
01:04:30.401 --> 01:04:35.401
<v Speaker 4>But I want the best for her and it </v>
<v Speaker 4>wasn't with me at that time and she's </v>

1301
01:04:35.401 --> 01:04:38.710
<v Speaker 4>moved on and that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't okay for me beforehand because</v>

1302
01:04:38.711 --> 01:04:42.160
<v Speaker 4>I mentally couldn't brought us it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whereas now I can look at it objectively</v>

1303
01:04:42.161 --> 01:04:44.200
<v Speaker 4>and say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get it.</v>

1304
01:04:44.201 --> 01:04:45.850
<v Speaker 4>I just want you to be happy and that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>awesome,</v>

1305
01:04:45.851 --> 01:04:46.990
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Good for you.</v>

1306
01:04:47.080 --> 01:04:49.060
<v Speaker 4>But it's an attitude that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

1307
01:04:49.061 --> 01:04:51.060
<v Speaker 4>I wish more people would take,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's not.</v>

1308
01:04:51.090 --> 01:04:52.660
<v Speaker 4>It's not easy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1309
01:04:52.661 --> 01:04:54.100
<v Speaker 4>That's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not easy.</v>

1310
01:04:54.370 --> 01:04:59.370
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how many other people have you turned </v>

1311
01:04:59.370 --> 01:04:59.370
<v Speaker 4>onto this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1312
01:04:59.370 --> 01:05:02.790
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you must know other guys that are </v>

1313
01:05:02.790 --> 01:05:02.790
<v Speaker 4>suffering from similar conditions or at </v>
<v Speaker 4>least you suspect they might be.</v>

1314
01:05:02.920 --> 01:05:04.120
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1315
01:05:04.180 --> 01:05:08.230
<v Speaker 4>that's this process right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's part of coming on the show is we're</v>

1316
01:05:08.231 --> 01:05:13.030
<v Speaker 4>creating a dialogue as we would like to </v>
<v Speaker 4>say Because no one knows us.</v>

1317
01:05:13.030 --> 01:05:14.950
<v Speaker 4>We want to empower veterans to be able </v>
<v Speaker 4>to say,</v>

1318
01:05:14.951 --> 01:05:19.951
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>go into their doctor and with something </v>

1319
01:05:19.951 --> 01:05:19.951
<v Speaker 4>just to say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

1320
01:05:19.951 --> 01:05:22.570
<v Speaker 4>can you do this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because now they don't know.</v>

1321
01:05:22.571 --> 01:05:27.571
<v Speaker 4>And if they know they can at least start</v>
<v Speaker 4>something or contact me or maybe jason </v>

1322
01:05:28.241 --> 01:05:33.241
<v Speaker 4>now or Dr.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Gordon and just get some kind of info </v>

1323
01:05:33.241 --> 01:05:33.241
<v Speaker 4>and get it going.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1324
01:05:33.241 --> 01:05:34.180
<v Speaker 4>and that's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1325
01:05:35.260 --> 01:05:40.260
<v Speaker 4>we're kind of limited because it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>almost like there's just a handful of </v>

1326
01:05:40.260 --> 01:05:43.681
<v Speaker 4>people that are doing this Dr.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Gordon and then a few doctors that he's </v>

1327
01:05:43.681 --> 01:05:43.681
<v Speaker 4>trained and gone over and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1328
01:05:43.720 --> 01:05:48.720
<v Speaker 4>they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're not in every state and every </v>

1329
01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:49.300
<v Speaker 4>city and every va in every practice.</v>

1330
01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:51.900
<v Speaker 7>It seems like they're getting an attack </v>
<v Speaker 7>to me.</v>

1331
01:05:51.901 --> 01:05:52.310
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I,</v>

1332
01:05:52.360 --> 01:05:57.360
<v Speaker 7>I got introduced at a naval special </v>
<v Speaker 7>warfare event to a guy who's doing some </v>

1333
01:05:57.421 --> 01:06:00.420
<v Speaker 7>of this work down in Texas that kerrick </v>
<v Speaker 7>and,</v>

1334
01:06:00.540 --> 01:06:01.480
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you,</v>

1335
01:06:01.560 --> 01:06:04.270
<v Speaker 7>you look him up and people are attacking</v>
<v Speaker 7>him and no,</v>

1336
01:06:04.290 --> 01:06:09.270
<v Speaker 7>this and that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And it was getting attacked by a doctor.</v>

1337
01:06:09.310 --> 01:06:14.310
<v Speaker 7>Other doctors,</v>
<v Speaker 7>people saying they were licensed to do </v>

1338
01:06:14.310 --> 01:06:16.851
<v Speaker 7>this or,</v>
<v Speaker 7>or it's experimental medicine or you </v>

1339
01:06:16.851 --> 01:06:16.851
<v Speaker 7>know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>these kinds of.</v>

1340
01:06:17.340 --> 01:06:22.340
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing that we're doing is </v>

1341
01:06:22.340 --> 01:06:23.661
<v Speaker 3>experimental.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all written about doctors are </v>

1342
01:06:23.661 --> 01:06:23.661
<v Speaker 3>treating it whether they know it or not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1343
01:06:23.661 --> 01:06:28.450
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're treating patients who are </v>

1344
01:06:28.450 --> 01:06:28.450
<v Speaker 3>testosterone deficient.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They never go into great depth.</v>

1345
01:06:28.450 --> 01:06:33.171
<v Speaker 3>Ask them their history because I know I </v>
<v Speaker 3>get a lot of patients coming from other </v>

1346
01:06:33.171 --> 01:06:37.880
<v Speaker 3>men's clinics type of organizations and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a guy recently who wanted to </v>

1347
01:06:38.431 --> 01:06:43.431
<v Speaker 3>transfer from his organization whereas </v>
<v Speaker 3>from his clinic to us and I asked them </v>

1348
01:06:43.621 --> 01:06:48.621
<v Speaker 3>to send a copy of his original labs and </v>
<v Speaker 3>to make sure it wasn't about using </v>

1349
01:06:48.621 --> 01:06:49.800
<v Speaker 3>steroids for bodybuilding or something </v>
<v Speaker 3>of that nature.</v>

1350
01:06:50.220 --> 01:06:53.580
<v Speaker 3>And he sent to the lab silver and </v>
<v Speaker 3>screaming on the lab results.</v>

1351
01:06:53.581 --> 01:06:58.581
<v Speaker 3>Very limited but significant enough you </v>
<v Speaker 3>can see that he had traumatic brain </v>

1352
01:06:58.581 --> 01:06:58.650
<v Speaker 3>injury in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I called them up,</v>

1353
01:06:58.660 --> 01:07:02.520
<v Speaker 3>use 41 years of age,</v>
<v Speaker 3>called him up and introduced myself.</v>

1354
01:07:02.520 --> 01:07:03.460
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1355
01:07:04.190 --> 01:07:05.790
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>were you ever in an accident?</v>

1356
01:07:05.791 --> 01:07:06.360
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1357
01:07:06.361 --> 01:07:11.361
<v Speaker 3>At 18 years of age he was broadsided on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the car and his head whip lash and hit </v>

1358
01:07:11.361 --> 01:07:15.441
<v Speaker 3>the glass and broke the glass window.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we need to go and do a better job at </v>

1359
01:07:18.301 --> 01:07:20.550
<v Speaker 3>history relative to traumatic brain </v>
<v Speaker 3>injury.</v>

1360
01:07:20.790 --> 01:07:25.790
<v Speaker 3>We're finding people who have hormonal </v>
<v Speaker 3>deficiency and never ask about their </v>

1361
01:07:25.790 --> 01:07:30.651
<v Speaker 3>history or someone comes into their doc </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they're depressed and the first </v>

1362
01:07:30.651 --> 01:07:32.040
<v Speaker 3>thing they do is they put them on drugs </v>
<v Speaker 3>instead of asking them,</v>

1363
01:07:32.280 --> 01:07:36.150
<v Speaker 3>have you had any head traumas or any </v>
<v Speaker 3>slip and falls or anything?</v>

1364
01:07:36.210 --> 01:07:37.730
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's that delay effect too.</v>

1365
01:07:37.740 --> 01:07:42.740
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't have to be wrecked car onset,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so when you go in there with this </v>

1366
01:07:42.740 --> 01:07:43.200
<v Speaker 4>problem,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no one's thinking to go,</v>

1367
01:07:43.201 --> 01:07:44.310
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>did you have this?</v>

1368
01:07:44.311 --> 01:07:46.140
<v Speaker 4>Because it might have happened 10 years </v>
<v Speaker 4>ago,</v>

1369
01:07:46.610 --> 01:07:51.610
<v Speaker 4>and so that's an issue with fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a big issue with fighters where I </v>

1370
01:07:51.610 --> 01:07:53.920
<v Speaker 4>see guys who have retired and then even </v>
<v Speaker 4>though they've retired,</v>

1371
01:07:53.921 --> 01:07:58.080
<v Speaker 4>like say if they're retiring like 2010,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you will see them three,</v>

1372
01:07:58.081 --> 01:08:03.081
<v Speaker 4>four years later with no fights at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have deteriorated significantly </v>

1373
01:08:03.081 --> 01:08:04.650
<v Speaker 4>over that period of time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like what it is.</v>

1374
01:08:04.770 --> 01:08:07.050
<v Speaker 4>How long does it take?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've heard 10 years.</v>

1375
01:08:07.120 --> 01:08:11.350
<v Speaker 3>It can be up to 17 is an article that </v>
<v Speaker 3>came out just recently that said that it</v>

1376
01:08:11.351 --> 01:08:16.351
<v Speaker 3>can take 17 years and it might be that </v>
<v Speaker 3>all their fights brought them up to the </v>

1377
01:08:17.181 --> 01:08:21.440
<v Speaker 3>edge and then something silly like </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting into a automobile accident,</v>

1378
01:08:21.470 --> 01:08:23.990
<v Speaker 3>five to seven miles an hour,</v>
<v Speaker 3>push them over the edge.</v>

1379
01:08:23.991 --> 01:08:28.991
<v Speaker 3>We had someone in san diego,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they had traumatic brain injury from a </v>

1380
01:08:28.991 --> 01:08:31.820
<v Speaker 3>five to seven mile an hour rear end,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they've had history of trauma in the</v>

1381
01:08:31.821 --> 01:08:36.821
<v Speaker 3>past.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just how much of the hormone may </v>

1382
01:08:36.821 --> 01:08:38.720
<v Speaker 3>lou do you have to lose before you flip </v>
<v Speaker 3>into symptoms?</v>

1383
01:08:38.930 --> 01:08:40.310
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have a lot of reserves,</v>

1384
01:08:40.311 --> 01:08:43.160
<v Speaker 3>systems In our body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a growth hormone reserve,</v>

1385
01:08:43.161 --> 01:08:48.161
<v Speaker 3>and when you lose that reserve,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you start deteriorating from growth </v>

1386
01:08:48.161 --> 01:08:49.010
<v Speaker 3>hormone deficiency with same thing with </v>
<v Speaker 3>testosterone,</v>

1387
01:08:49.011 --> 01:08:50.090
<v Speaker 3>estrogen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the hormones.</v>

1388
01:08:50.091 --> 01:08:55.091
<v Speaker 3>We have a reserved mechanism where </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a little bit hanging around and </v>

1389
01:08:55.091 --> 01:08:55.730
<v Speaker 3>when you lose that reserve,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1390
01:08:56.090 --> 01:09:01.090
<v Speaker 3>you lose the battle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You then become a susceptible to all the</v>

1391
01:09:01.220 --> 01:09:02.150
<v Speaker 3>situation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1392
01:09:02.210 --> 01:09:04.490
<v Speaker 3>the depression,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fatigue and so forth that occur.</v>

1393
01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:09.880
<v Speaker 3>And how'd you get.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How'd you guys all get involved </v>

1394

<v Speaker 3>together?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How did jason get into this?</v>

1416
01:10:08.190 --> 01:10:08.230
<v Speaker 7>who's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>who makes this huge sacrifice,</v>

1417
01:10:08.231 --> 01:10:10.870
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>when he sacrifices spiritually,</v>

<v Speaker 7>mentally,</v>
<v Speaker 7>hIs family,</v>

<v Speaker 7>And he comes home and he's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he's got to fight another war,</v>

1421
01:10:18.070 --> 01:10:23.070
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>this guy fought as hard to get home as </v>

1422
01:10:23.070 --> 01:10:25.291
<v Speaker 7>he fought over there and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and I just feel like we're looking at </v>

1423
01:10:25.961 --> 01:10:29.710
<v Speaker 7>this thing and it's kinda like the </v>
<v Speaker 7>public is just standing outside of glass</v>

1424
01:10:29.711 --> 01:10:32.020
<v Speaker 7>and banging their head on it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>everyone's like,</v>

1425
01:10:32.021 --> 01:10:33.910
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>why are these guys shootIng themselves?</v>

1426
01:10:34.180 --> 01:10:36.700
<v Speaker 7>They hear the statistic that are like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>why are these guys putting guns in their</v>

1427
01:10:36.701 --> 01:10:37.510
<v Speaker 7>mouth?</v>
<v Speaker 7>So I don't get it.</v>

1428
01:10:37.720 --> 01:10:42.720
<v Speaker 7>They're not even asking that question.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Just the general public is completely </v>

1429
01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:42.820
<v Speaker 7>ignorant to it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

1430
01:10:42.821 --> 01:10:47.821
<v Speaker 7>the average person you walked down the </v>
<v Speaker 7>street and say how many soldiers killed </v>

1431
01:10:47.821 --> 01:10:48.250
<v Speaker 7>themselves?</v>
<v Speaker 7>They would have no idea that it would be</v>

1432
01:10:48.251 --> 01:10:53.251
<v Speaker 7>as many,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if not more than that stigma I was </v>

1433
01:10:53.251 --> 01:10:56.131
<v Speaker 7>telling you about.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You say you have ptsd or something and </v>

1434
01:10:56.131 --> 01:10:56.131
<v Speaker 7>they meet,</v>
<v Speaker 7>whoa,</v>

1435
01:10:56.131 --> 01:10:57.190
<v Speaker 7>we need to lock you up.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

1436
01:10:57.191 --> 01:10:59.410
<v Speaker 7>there's that mentality that now you're </v>
<v Speaker 7>dangerous.</v>

1437
01:10:59.411 --> 01:11:01.540
<v Speaker 7>And it's so.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think they,</v>

1438
01:11:01.541 --> 01:11:02.100
<v Speaker 7>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1439
01:11:02.170 --> 01:11:03.890
<v Speaker 7>ignorance is bliss.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Let's just snow.</v>

1440
01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:05.790
<v Speaker 7>It's hard to talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's hard to like,</v>

1441
01:11:05.860 --> 01:11:07.360
<v Speaker 7>it's hard to dig in,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know?</v>

1442
01:11:07.361 --> 01:11:09.700
<v Speaker 7>And it's hard to,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we have this thing where we're like,</v>

1443

1445
01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:15.900
<v Speaker 6>also puts a hand up at the same time.</v>

01:11:24.451 --> 01:11:27.170
<v Speaker 6>you wouldn't thank me if you knew what I</v>
<v Speaker 6>had to do here.</v>

1451
01:11:27.330 --> 01:11:28.480
<v Speaker 6>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

1452
01:11:28.550 --> 01:11:29.760
<v Speaker 6>and it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it,</v>

1453
01:11:29.910 --> 01:11:31.890
<v Speaker 6>it kind of prevents conversation in a </v>
<v Speaker 6>way.</v>

1454
01:11:32.070 --> 01:11:33.580
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's also that movement out there and</v>

1455
01:11:33.581 --> 01:11:35.380

<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1456
01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:36.510
<v Speaker 6>and it kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1457
01:11:36.511 --> 01:11:39.330
<v Speaker 6>I remember coming back a few times and </v>
<v Speaker 6>seeing protests and it's,</v>

1458
01:11:39.630 --> 01:11:41.780
<v Speaker 6>it doesn't anger me,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it was a,</v>

1459
01:11:41.781 --> 01:11:46.781
<v Speaker 6>a situation of it's like you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you just knew this wouldn't be what </v>

1460
01:11:46.781 --> 01:11:51.561
<v Speaker 6>you're doIng right now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So convenient to protest it mean just </v>

1461
01:11:51.561 --> 01:11:55.821
<v Speaker 6>saying that you support the troops and </v>
<v Speaker 6>just saying that you,</v>

1462
01:11:56.040 --> 01:12:01.040
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you want them to come back home is </v>

1463
01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:01.040
<v Speaker 6>really support the troops come back </v>
<v Speaker 6>home.</v>

1464
01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:01.980
<v Speaker 6>But that's all.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's very convenient.</v>

1465
01:12:01.981 --> 01:12:03.240
<v Speaker 6>It's very correct.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1466
01:12:03.241 --> 01:12:05.250
<v Speaker 6>we all would like less war in this </v>
<v Speaker 6>world,</v>

1467
01:12:05.640 --> 01:12:10.640
<v Speaker 6>but the reality of supporting the troops</v>
<v Speaker 6>and the reality of the protesting as </v>

1468
01:12:10.640 --> 01:12:14.331
<v Speaker 6>you're dealing with these people that </v>
<v Speaker 6>have gone through something that you're </v>

1469
01:12:14.331 --> 01:12:16.731
<v Speaker 6>never going to be able to comprehend,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it is absolutely impossible for you to </v>

1470
01:12:16.731 --> 01:12:19.971
<v Speaker 6>be able to comprehend just </v>
<v Speaker 6>psychologically what they're dealing </v>

1471
01:12:19.971 --> 01:12:22.551
<v Speaker 6>with and to add in this physical aspect </v>
<v Speaker 6>of it.</v>

1472
01:12:22.590 --> 01:12:25.170
<v Speaker 6>The traumatic brain injury,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the loss of hormones,</v>

1473
01:12:25.171 --> 01:12:29.940
<v Speaker 6>the the loss of the ability to cope </v>
<v Speaker 6>because of this hormonal deficiencies.</v>

1474
01:12:30.090 --> 01:12:35.090
<v Speaker 6>There's so much going on.</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's so much going on and when you </v>

1475
01:12:35.090 --> 01:12:35.820
<v Speaker 6>see people protesting,</v>
<v Speaker 6>getting upset at troops,</v>

1476
01:12:36.030 --> 01:12:41.030
<v Speaker 6>you're talking about kids.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're talking about 18 year old kids </v>

1477
01:12:41.030 --> 01:12:43.761
<v Speaker 6>that are in unbelievably easily </v>
<v Speaker 6>influenced that are sent over there and </v>

1478
01:12:43.761 --> 01:12:46.810
<v Speaker 6>essentially brainwashed.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're immediately thrown into your.</v>

1479
01:12:46.840 --> 01:12:51.840
<v Speaker 6>You're thrown into these training </v>
<v Speaker 6>courses that treat you how to block </v>

1480
01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:52.530
<v Speaker 6>things out,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how to become a trained killer,</v>

1481
01:12:52.680 --> 01:12:55.020
<v Speaker 6>and then they come back and people want </v>
<v Speaker 6>to protest against them.</v>

1482
01:12:55.290 --> 01:13:00.290
<v Speaker 6>Like what do you expect them to be </v>
<v Speaker 6>unbelievably unique and be able to deal </v>

1483
01:13:00.290 --> 01:13:05.181
<v Speaker 6>with this and process it in some sort of</v>
<v Speaker 6>a strange and very unusual way where </v>

1484
01:13:05.181 --> 01:13:08.220
<v Speaker 6>they don't they,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they become a conscientious objector.</v>

1485
01:13:08.221 --> 01:13:10.010
<v Speaker 6>They step outside of it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1486
01:13:10.230 --> 01:13:14.520
<v Speaker 6>when I see people protesting the actual </v>
<v Speaker 6>soldiers themselves,</v>

1487
01:13:14.521 --> 01:13:17.310
<v Speaker 6>it's very maddening because that could </v>
<v Speaker 6>have been me.</v>

1488
01:13:17.670 --> 01:13:22.670
<v Speaker 6>It could've been a lot of us.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was you and it could have been </v>

1489
01:13:22.670 --> 01:13:25.761
<v Speaker 6>anybody who joins the military and that </v>
<v Speaker 6>that shit drives me fucking crazy that </v>

1490
01:13:25.761 --> 01:13:28.020
<v Speaker 6>you're blaming the soldiers for what </v>
<v Speaker 6>happens.</v>

1491
01:13:28.410 --> 01:13:33.410
<v Speaker 6>It's one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>one of the most infuriating things and </v>

1492
01:13:33.410 --> 01:13:33.660
<v Speaker 6>I've seen it time and time again.</v>

1493
01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:38.840
<v Speaker 6>It's so easy to do and it's so short </v>
<v Speaker 6>sighted when there's also no course when</v>

1494
01:13:39.391 --> 01:13:40.220
<v Speaker 6>you get,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when you're getting.</v>

1495
01:13:40.230 --> 01:13:41.280
<v Speaker 6>I mean really,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's no.</v>

1496
01:13:41.320 --> 01:13:43.740
<v Speaker 6>I mean they do all these training things</v>
<v Speaker 6>to help you deal with getting out,</v>

1497
01:13:44.010 --> 01:13:49.010
<v Speaker 6>but there's no like magic course that </v>
<v Speaker 6>you take and all of a sudden you can </v>

1498
01:13:49.010 --> 01:13:49.010
<v Speaker 6>fucking deal with life again.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1499
01:13:49.010 --> 01:13:51.870
<v Speaker 6>you're used to a structured life almost </v>
<v Speaker 6>every day.</v>

1500
01:13:51.930 --> 01:13:54.660
<v Speaker 6>Have you do this at 6:00</v>
<v Speaker 6>in the morning?</v>

1501
01:13:54.661 --> 01:13:56.310
<v Speaker 6>You do this at 10:00</v>
<v Speaker 6>in the morning,</v>

1502
01:13:56.311 --> 01:13:57.390
<v Speaker 6>you do,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you do this,</v>

1503
01:13:57.391 --> 01:13:59.850
<v Speaker 6>you eat here,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you eat when they tell you this much,</v>

1504
01:13:59.851 --> 01:14:04.851
<v Speaker 6>you do this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and then you go over there and you're </v>

1505
01:14:04.851 --> 01:14:04.851
<v Speaker 6>doIng the same kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You do these routines,</v>

1506
01:14:04.851 --> 01:14:08.721
<v Speaker 6>you do these routines and then you get </v>
<v Speaker 6>out and you're literally left to just </v>

1507
01:14:08.721 --> 01:14:10.320
<v Speaker 6>fucking figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Guys say that about prison as well.</v>

1508
01:14:10.390 --> 01:14:11.230
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well why?</v>

1509
01:14:11.231 --> 01:14:12.190
<v Speaker 6>A lot of guys want to go back</v>

1510
01:14:12.190 --> 01:14:16.060
<v Speaker 4>to prison.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I've known people who have gotten</v>

1511
01:14:16.061 --> 01:14:21.061
<v Speaker 4>out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>couldn't handle it and went back in </v>

1512
01:14:21.061 --> 01:14:21.061
<v Speaker 4>because they were so used to that </v>
<v Speaker 4>structure life.</v>

1513
01:14:21.130 --> 01:14:26.130
<v Speaker 4>It almost is that kind of indoctrination</v>
<v Speaker 4>of when you're 18 in a way because </v>

1514
01:14:26.130 --> 01:14:26.530
<v Speaker 4>that's all they've known and they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>still babies at 18.</v>

1515
01:14:26.531 --> 01:14:27.540
<v Speaker 4>They don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1516
01:14:27.560 --> 01:14:32.560
<v Speaker 4>maybe that's just how life was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's just what they know and they go </v>

1517
01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:32.710
<v Speaker 4>back and it's comfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's comfortable.</v>

1518
01:14:33.700 --> 01:14:38.700
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Three or four years ago they had a </v>

1519
01:14:38.700 --> 01:14:42.181
<v Speaker 4>strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anyone coming into the military had to </v>

1520
01:14:42.181 --> 01:14:44.320
<v Speaker 4>go through assessment and then when they</v>
<v Speaker 4>exit they're supposed to go through some</v>

1521
01:14:44.321 --> 01:14:46.710
<v Speaker 4>kind of exit assessment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is thAt being done?</v>

1522
01:14:47.410 --> 01:14:49.840
<v Speaker 4>Don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't know collIns,</v>

1523

<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1524
01:14:51.240 --> 01:14:56.240
<v Speaker 4>you always go in with some kind of a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a basic assessment physically just to </v>

1525
01:14:56.240 --> 01:14:58.780
<v Speaker 4>see if you meet certain criteria.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1526
01:14:58.900 --> 01:15:00.520
<v Speaker 4>but when you get out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1527
01:15:02.590 --> 01:15:07.480
<v Speaker 4>so as like a person who is in charge of </v>
<v Speaker 4>most of the team's health type of thing.</v>

1528
01:15:07.690 --> 01:15:10.390
<v Speaker 4>You do like physicals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you do their lab work,</v>

1534
01:15:22.501 --> 01:15:25.800
<v Speaker 4>needs to be done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do they give you any psychological </v>

1535
01:15:25.800 --> 01:15:26.950
<v Speaker 4>counseling about like how to reintegrate</v>
<v Speaker 4>to society,</v>

1536
01:15:26.951 --> 01:15:31.951
<v Speaker 4>how to deal with protests,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how to deal with people calling you a </v>

1537
01:15:31.951 --> 01:15:33.070
<v Speaker 4>baby killer or whatever the fuck </v>

<v Speaker 4>have classes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like when you're a pqs and out or </v>

<v Speaker 4>can learn like job skills.</v>

1545
01:15:55.091 --> 01:16:00.091
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't personally do any of those </v>

1546
01:16:00.091 --> 01:16:00.091
<v Speaker 4>courses.</v>

1547
01:16:00.091 --> 01:16:02.280
<v Speaker 4>I did different things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they have these things for them and </v>

1548
01:16:02.280 --> 01:16:02.280
<v Speaker 4>you go through these things but nothing </v>
<v Speaker 4>like.</v>

1549
01:16:02.570 --> 01:16:06.190
<v Speaker 4>And can you train anyone really to how </v>
<v Speaker 4>to deal with being called a baby killer?</v>

1550

<v Speaker 4>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean you just,</v>

1552
01:16:09.310 --> 01:16:11.200
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well yeah,</v>

1553
01:16:11.201 --> 01:16:16.201
<v Speaker 4>we put all this money into training them</v>
<v Speaker 4>to fight it and then no money into </v>

1554
01:16:16.201 --> 01:16:18.340
<v Speaker 4>training them to find peace.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a very good way of putting it.</v>

1555
01:16:18.700 --> 01:16:20.680
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The internal piece that they need,</v>

1556
01:16:21.010 --> 01:16:22.780
<v Speaker 4>that we need.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there's this uh,</v>

1557
01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:24.040
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1558
01:16:24.041 --> 01:16:25.990
<v Speaker 4>I look at the met,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been doing a lot of thinking of the</v>

1559
01:16:25.991 --> 01:16:30.991
<v Speaker 4>medication lately and stuff like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just because I can't believe everything </v>

1560
01:16:30.991 --> 01:16:32.320
<v Speaker 4>that I've been given and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is,</v>

1561
01:16:32.321 --> 01:16:37.321
<v Speaker 4>it's like there's a market in this ptsd </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing right now and it's just like </v>

1562
01:16:37.321 --> 01:16:37.420
<v Speaker 4>everyone's coming back.</v>

1563
01:16:37.420 --> 01:16:39.430
<v Speaker 4>If you have this symptom or that </v>
<v Speaker 4>symptom,</v>

1564
01:16:39.580 --> 01:16:43.330
<v Speaker 4>you go in there and you fall under this </v>
<v Speaker 4>blanket of that and they're,</v>

1565
01:16:43.510 --> 01:16:48.510
<v Speaker 4>they're gonna put you in there and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not getting out of it because no </v>

1566
01:16:48.510 --> 01:16:51.790
<v Speaker 4>one's going to look any farther than </v>
<v Speaker 4>that and that past to change.</v>

1567
01:16:51.820 --> 01:16:56.820
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're treating everything backwards </v>

1568
01:16:56.820 --> 01:16:56.820
<v Speaker 4>and so who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

1569
01:16:56.920 --> 01:16:59.020
<v Speaker 4>that's the info.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just needs to get out there.</v>

1570
01:16:59.410 --> 01:17:01.180
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think this is going to help,</v>

1571
01:17:01.181 --> 01:17:03.130
<v Speaker 4>but obviously it helped you the first </v>
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

1572
01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:08.160
<v Speaker 4>I'm Dr.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Gordon talked about it in the podcast </v>

1573
01:17:08.160 --> 01:17:08.160
<v Speaker 4>that you heard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For sure.</v>

1574
01:17:08.160 --> 01:17:12.271
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I deeply indebted that you have </v>

1575
01:17:12.271 --> 01:17:14.501
<v Speaker 4>people on here that are coming in and </v>
<v Speaker 4>sharing new ideas or just things that </v>

1576
01:17:15.080 --> 01:17:16.530
<v Speaker 4>people need to hear.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1577
01:17:17.150 --> 01:17:18.140
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean this.</v>

1578
01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:19.550
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have no idea.</v>

1579
01:17:19.551 --> 01:17:24.551
<v Speaker 4>I mean I could be dead right now if that</v>
<v Speaker 4>hadn't happened because I mean let's be </v>

1580
01:17:24.551 --> 01:17:28.961
<v Speaker 4>frank are probably would be dead and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that in a way probably needed to happen </v>

1581
01:17:29.480 --> 01:17:33.790
<v Speaker 4>for me to get enough courage to say this</v>
<v Speaker 4>is something I need to try.</v>

1582
01:17:33.830 --> 01:17:34.760
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had nothing,</v>

1583
01:17:34.790 --> 01:17:39.790
<v Speaker 4>nothing to lose by applying or nothing </v>
<v Speaker 4>to lose about coming down here and just </v>

1584
01:17:41.031 --> 01:17:44.060
<v Speaker 4>seeing what was going on and trying </v>
<v Speaker 4>nothing to lose.</v>

1585
01:17:44.300 --> 01:17:48.260
<v Speaker 4>And the problem right now is we need to </v>
<v Speaker 4>get money so that we can help people.</v>

1586
01:17:48.410 --> 01:17:51.350
<v Speaker 4>We need funding,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we need to get the word out there.</v>

1587
01:17:51.650 --> 01:17:56.650
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're trying to get a non charitable </v>

1588
01:17:56.650 --> 01:17:57.950

<v Speaker 4>things like that.</v>

01:18:22.151 --> 01:18:23.770
<v Speaker 3>We not just know fornia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no one.</v>

1597
01:18:23.860 --> 01:18:28.860
<v Speaker 3>Jesus jason looked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got a couple of people who have </v>

1598
01:18:28.860 --> 01:18:31.471
<v Speaker 3>looked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no one else doing it and now </v>

1599
01:18:31.471 --> 01:18:33.190
<v Speaker 3>they're doing some very basic hormone </v>
<v Speaker 3>because since 2004,</v>

1600
01:18:33.191 --> 01:18:38.191
<v Speaker 3>I've been going around the world </v>
<v Speaker 3>lecturing on traumatic brain injury and </v>

1601
01:18:38.191 --> 01:18:40.090
<v Speaker 3>hormone deficiency syndrome,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't have the nuances that are</v>

1602
01:18:40.091 --> 01:18:41.680
<v Speaker 3>in there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they start off by giving.</v>

1603
01:18:41.710 --> 01:18:46.710
<v Speaker 3>Just to start from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the issues with just giving </v>

1604
01:18:46.710 --> 01:18:47.680
<v Speaker 3>testosterone is we have a mechanism in </v>
<v Speaker 3>our body.</v>

1605
01:18:47.681 --> 01:18:51.490
<v Speaker 3>If you give a hormone or a chemical into</v>
<v Speaker 3>the body that's normally there,</v>

1606
01:18:51.640 --> 01:18:53.970
<v Speaker 3>it shuts off the origin of that </v>
<v Speaker 3>chemical.</v>

1607
01:18:53.971 --> 01:18:58.240
<v Speaker 3>So upstream precursors are shut off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in testosterone,</v>

1608
01:18:58.241 --> 01:19:03.241
<v Speaker 3>the two very important upstream </v>
<v Speaker 3>precursors or pregnenolone and dah da.</v>

1609
01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:09.000
<v Speaker 3>So it takes about four to six Months </v>
<v Speaker 3>before you shut off those two and they </v>

1610
01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:12.481
<v Speaker 3>affect the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what you'll see in patients who are </v>

1611
01:19:12.481 --> 01:19:14.821
<v Speaker 3>just put on testosterone is that they'll</v>
<v Speaker 3>start complaining that they're not </v>

1612
01:19:14.821 --> 01:19:18.780
<v Speaker 3>experiencing the same effect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're losing the benefit and the </v>

1613
01:19:18.780 --> 01:19:20.020
<v Speaker 3>commonest thing that's done is they </v>
<v Speaker 3>increase the amount of testosterone,</v>

1614
01:19:20.290 --> 01:19:22.480
<v Speaker 3>increased the amount of estrogen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They get bitch tits,</v>

1615
01:19:22.481 --> 01:19:23.190
<v Speaker 3>and they get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1616
01:19:23.290 --> 01:19:26.170
<v Speaker 3>feminine kind of attitudes and so forth.</v>

1617
01:19:26.280 --> 01:19:28.200
<v Speaker 2>What are you trying to say by feminine?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1618
01:19:28.440 --> 01:19:30.480
<v Speaker 2>how dare you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got three daughters,</v>

1619
01:19:30.481 --> 01:19:32.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you trying to say?</v>

1620
01:19:33.180 --> 01:19:35.370
<v Speaker 2>You're going to get the feminist as </v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

1621
01:19:36.060 --> 01:19:38.580
<v Speaker 2>As long as they're pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty feminists.</v>

1622
01:19:38.760 --> 01:19:42.570
<v Speaker 2>You just said jumbo tron,</v>
<v Speaker 2>military intelligence.</v>

1623
01:19:43.860 --> 01:19:48.860
<v Speaker 2>So I think it took huge balls for you to</v>
<v Speaker 2>come down here and do this too.</v>

1624
01:19:50.310 --> 01:19:51.280
<v Speaker 2>I had no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was was</v>

1625
01:19:51.290 --> 01:19:52.400
<v Speaker 4>three months.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like.</v>

1626
01:19:52.401 --> 01:19:53.900
<v Speaker 4>Honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's fucking awesome.</v>

1627
01:19:55.310 --> 01:19:58.180
<v Speaker 4>It think that's a success story,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

1628
01:19:58.181 --> 01:20:03.181
<v Speaker 4>it's just how many other people do we </v>
<v Speaker 4>need to have the same thing so they can </v>

1629
01:20:03.181 --> 01:20:05.180
<v Speaker 4>wake up and there's guys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's guys out there suffering,</v>

1630
01:20:05.181 --> 01:20:05.980
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1631
01:20:06.290 --> 01:20:08.430
<v Speaker 4>we have a captain families,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know captain</v>

1632
01:20:08.430 --> 01:20:11.880
<v Speaker 3>who is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm 21 years after his initial,</v>

1633
01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:16.770
<v Speaker 3>a traumatic brain injury and five weeks </v>
<v Speaker 3>he was 70 percent better.</v>

1634
01:20:17.040 --> 01:20:22.040
<v Speaker 3>He gets better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He gets redeployed to Afghanistan </v>

1635
01:20:22.040 --> 01:20:24.351
<v Speaker 3>because he's better at for a year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He comes back and he's up in the eightY </v>

1636
01:20:24.351 --> 01:20:27.000
<v Speaker 3>percent improvement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ninety percent now he's been a have five</v>

1637
01:20:27.001 --> 01:20:32.001
<v Speaker 3>shaped building in Washington over </v>
<v Speaker 3>wherever he is and he's trying to help </v>

1638
01:20:32.001 --> 01:20:33.690
<v Speaker 3>to find the avenue for us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because you know,</v>

1639
01:20:33.691 --> 01:20:38.691
<v Speaker 3>he's living,</v>
<v Speaker 3>breathing proof that what we do is it </v>

1640
01:20:38.691 --> 01:20:39.900
<v Speaker 3>works and it is very simple basics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>back to the basics,</v>

1641
01:20:39.901 --> 01:20:44.100
<v Speaker 3>replace the hormones that are deficient </v>
<v Speaker 3>and protect the brain and it works.</v>

1642
01:20:44.490 --> 01:20:49.490
<v Speaker 3>And the other thing is that we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>missing or things like alzheimer's </v>

1643
01:20:49.490 --> 01:20:49.590
<v Speaker 3>disease,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we talked about traumatic brain injury.</v>

1644
01:20:49.620 --> 01:20:54.620
<v Speaker 3>We think it's just blunt injury to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>head while ionizing radiation from </v>

1645
01:20:54.811 --> 01:20:57.090
<v Speaker 3>excessive x-rays,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ct scans,</v>

1646
01:20:57.360 --> 01:21:02.360
<v Speaker 3>regular dental x rays,</v>
<v Speaker 3>skull x rays can cause damage to the </v>

1647
01:21:02.360 --> 01:21:03.570
<v Speaker 3>control mechanism in the brain called </v>
<v Speaker 3>the hypothalamus.</v>

1648
01:21:04.200 --> 01:21:09.200
<v Speaker 3>I'm also subdural hematomas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is bleeding in the brain from </v>

1649
01:21:09.200 --> 01:21:12.891
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>boxing has now been associated with all </v>

1650
01:21:12.891 --> 01:21:15.531
<v Speaker 3>the same symptoms and hormonal </v>
<v Speaker 3>deficiencies akin to traumatic brain </v>

1651
01:21:15.531 --> 01:21:18.750
<v Speaker 3>injury.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So strokes or it's another one,</v>

1652
01:21:19.020 --> 01:21:20.880
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>surgery.</v>

1653
01:21:21.010 --> 01:21:22.020
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have,</v>

1654
01:21:22.060 --> 01:21:27.060
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the robin williams issue that </v>

1655
01:21:27.060 --> 01:21:29.350
<v Speaker 3>this is that now there was one article </v>
<v Speaker 3>that came out that started looking at </v>

1656
01:21:29.350 --> 01:21:29.940
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1657
01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:35.000
<v Speaker 3>where there are some 20,700</v>
<v Speaker 3>articles that had been written on.</v>

1658
01:21:35.720 --> 01:21:40.720
<v Speaker 3>I knoW that because I use something </v>
<v Speaker 3>called google scholar and it tells you </v>

1659
01:21:40.720 --> 01:21:41.730
<v Speaker 3>in zero point zero,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one seconds,</v>

1660
01:21:41.731 --> 01:21:42.900
<v Speaker 3>it pulled up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1661
01:21:43.080 --> 01:21:45.720
<v Speaker 3>20,700</v>
<v Speaker 3>articles and you put in,</v>

1662
01:21:45.780 --> 01:21:47.130
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cabbage,</v>

1663
01:21:47.131 --> 01:21:50.010
<v Speaker 3>which is coronary artery bypass graph </v>
<v Speaker 3>and depression,</v>

1664
01:21:50.011 --> 01:21:55.011
<v Speaker 3>and you see 20,700</v>
<v Speaker 3>articles come up talking about </v>

1665
01:21:55.011 --> 01:21:56.740
<v Speaker 3>postsurgical post heart surgery,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1666
01:21:57.090 --> 01:22:02.090
<v Speaker 3>depression and robin williams in 2009 </v>
<v Speaker 3>had a major heart surgery on an air </v>

1667
01:22:02.730 --> 01:22:07.730
<v Speaker 3>valve replacement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And now what we're also finding is that </v>

1668
01:22:07.730 --> 01:22:10.730
<v Speaker 3>thyroid changes the thyroid production </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the body changes after prolonged </v>

1669
01:22:10.730 --> 01:22:14.871
<v Speaker 3>surgery and it generates a form of </v>
<v Speaker 3>thyroid hormone that's inactive and </v>

1670
01:22:14.970 --> 01:22:19.970
<v Speaker 3>associated with low thyroid is </v>
<v Speaker 3>depression associated with damage to the</v>

1671
01:22:20.041 --> 01:22:23.610
<v Speaker 3>pituitary from prolonged surgery is </v>
<v Speaker 3>hormonal shutdown.</v>

1672
01:22:24.360 --> 01:22:26.740
<v Speaker 3>So I believe that it probably is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1673
01:22:26.940 --> 01:22:29.430
<v Speaker 3>contributory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially when the pathologist came out</v>

1674
01:22:29.850 --> 01:22:33.540
<v Speaker 3>and said that there were no drugs and no</v>
<v Speaker 3>medication,</v>

1675
01:22:33.600 --> 01:22:35.670
<v Speaker 3>no alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no medication in his blood,</v>

1676
01:22:36.450 --> 01:22:41.450
<v Speaker 3>but of course they're not going to look </v>
<v Speaker 3>at the hormone may loop to see if there </v>

1677
01:22:41.450 --> 01:22:44.841
<v Speaker 3>was a deficiency.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Low levels of testosterone leads to </v>

1678
01:22:44.841 --> 01:22:46.200
<v Speaker 3>depression,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you can find a 70,000</v>

1679
01:22:46.201 --> 01:22:51.201
<v Speaker 3>articles in this chapter on </v>
<v Speaker 3>neuropsychiatry and traumatic brain </v>

1680
01:22:51.201 --> 01:22:52.830
<v Speaker 3>injury.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are 432,000</v>

1681
01:22:52.831 --> 01:22:55.890
<v Speaker 3>articles on growth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hormone deficiency and depression.</v>

1682
01:22:56.280 --> 01:22:59.520
<v Speaker 3>There are 235,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>articles on thyroid.</v>

1683
01:22:59.730 --> 01:23:01.680
<v Speaker 3>70,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>on testosterone,</v>

1684
01:23:02.010 --> 01:23:07.010
<v Speaker 3>a dah da has about 17,000.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Estrogen has a large amount of </v>

1685
01:23:07.010 --> 01:23:10.760
<v Speaker 3>progesterone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All have depression articles that have </v>

1686
01:23:10.760 --> 01:23:14.101
<v Speaker 3>been written since 2000 2013,</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost 850,000</v>

1687
01:23:14.411 --> 01:23:16.420
<v Speaker 3>articles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

1688
01:23:16.450 --> 01:23:17.770
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Instead just producing it.</v>

1689
01:23:17.771 --> 01:23:20.620
<v Speaker 3>They're just publishing them to publish </v>
<v Speaker 3>it and no one's reading them.</v>

1690
01:23:21.280 --> 01:23:26.280
<v Speaker 3>So essentially what we're dealing with </v>
<v Speaker 3>when it comes to happiness and avoiding </v>

1691
01:23:26.280 --> 01:23:30.541
<v Speaker 3>depression is the entire body as a unit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as an individual unit has to be </v>

1692
01:23:30.551 --> 01:23:31.120
<v Speaker 3>balanced.</v>

1693
01:23:31.180 --> 01:23:32.590
<v Speaker 3>Correct?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to be healthy,</v>

1694
01:23:32.591 --> 01:23:35.620
<v Speaker 3>you have to have the proper nutrients,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to have rest and exercise,</v>

1695
01:23:35.621 --> 01:23:37.810
<v Speaker 3>and you have to have your hormones in </v>
<v Speaker 3>line.</v>

1696
01:23:38.080 --> 01:23:43.080
<v Speaker 3>If they are not in line,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to deal with all sorts of </v>

1697
01:23:43.080 --> 01:23:43.080
<v Speaker 3>issues,</v>
<v Speaker 3>compensatory issues,</v>

1698
01:23:43.510 --> 01:23:48.510
<v Speaker 3>depression,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the all the buffers that caused you to </v>

1699
01:23:48.581 --> 01:23:50.710
<v Speaker 3>lash out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to not lash out.</v>

1700
01:23:50.711 --> 01:23:52.030
<v Speaker 3>All those are gone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>correct?</v>

1701
01:23:52.730 --> 01:23:54.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a crazy thing to talk about.</v>

1702
01:23:54.941 --> 01:23:56.160
<v Speaker 3>I'm starting to revenue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's just.</v>

1703
01:23:56.170 --> 01:24:01.170
<v Speaker 3>It seems like there's a rush to get this</v>
<v Speaker 3>information out here while these 40 </v>

1704
01:24:01.841 --> 01:24:06.841
<v Speaker 3>soldiers of killing themselves a day and</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're just talking about soldiers were </v>

1705
01:24:06.841 --> 01:24:07.150
<v Speaker 3>not dealing with people in car </v>
<v Speaker 3>accidents.</v>

1706
01:24:07.360 --> 01:24:08.830
<v Speaker 3>People will kick box,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1707
01:24:08.860 --> 01:24:11.530
<v Speaker 3>the people have played football that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>all dealing with thiS.</v>

1708
01:24:12.340 --> 01:24:17.340
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot going on here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's more than enough going on and </v>

1709
01:24:17.340 --> 01:24:22.260
<v Speaker 3>the resistance of the industry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my industry and the medical industry is </v>

1710
01:24:22.260 --> 01:24:24.640
<v Speaker 3>what is perplexing on one part because </v>
<v Speaker 3>we went through,</v>

1711
01:24:24.690 --> 01:24:27.250
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>medical school and hopefully we all read</v>

1712
01:24:27.251 --> 01:24:32.251
<v Speaker 3>the hippocratic oath and we're supposed </v>
<v Speaker 3>to serve the betterment of humanity and </v>

1713
01:24:32.381 --> 01:24:36.790
<v Speaker 3>trying to help fix them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I don't think that's being done.</v>

1714
01:24:37.180 --> 01:24:39.100
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's really being focused </v>
<v Speaker 3>on.</v>

1715
01:24:39.930 --> 01:24:44.930
<v Speaker 3>I think unfortunately I believe that </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're more pawns in a game of chess </v>

1716
01:24:45.191 --> 01:24:49.450
<v Speaker 3>where pharmaceutical companies are </v>
<v Speaker 3>dictating to the insurance companies.</v>

1717
01:24:49.451 --> 01:24:54.451
<v Speaker 3>Insurance companies are dictating to </v>
<v Speaker 3>both the patients and to the physicians </v>

1718
01:24:54.451 --> 01:24:57.571
<v Speaker 3>on how to run medicine so that you walk </v>
<v Speaker 3>into your office and you know you're no </v>

1719
01:24:57.571 --> 01:25:00.480
<v Speaker 3>longer an individual,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're just a number on a card,</v>

1720
01:25:00.630 --> 01:25:02.920
<v Speaker 3>but the pen will dial bill.</v>

1721
01:25:03.050 --> 01:25:08.050
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The people getting this treatment are </v>

1722
01:25:08.050 --> 01:25:09.710
<v Speaker 7>the rich 45 year old white guys who can </v>
<v Speaker 7>afford it,</v>

1723
01:25:10.550 --> 01:25:15.550
<v Speaker 7>who are all on testosterone,</v>
<v Speaker 7>who are all finding some benefit to </v>

1724
01:25:15.561 --> 01:25:16.460
<v Speaker 7>their,</v>
<v Speaker 7>to their,</v>

1725
01:25:16.760 --> 01:25:17.750
<v Speaker 7>to their body and mind,</v>

1726
01:25:18.020 --> 01:25:20.840
<v Speaker 3>but even that is not being done </v>
<v Speaker 3>correctly.</v>

1727
01:25:21.410 --> 01:25:23.360
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't sound like it's being done </v>
<v Speaker 3>correctly at all.</v>

1728
01:25:23.840 --> 01:25:26.210
<v Speaker 3>It's they're doing it as an entry point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1729
01:25:26.211 --> 01:25:31.211
<v Speaker 3>I've been giving classes on andropause </v>
<v Speaker 3>which is testosterone deficiency amount </v>

1730
01:25:31.211 --> 01:25:35.051
<v Speaker 3>of pause,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is growth hormone deficiency and </v>

1731
01:25:35.051 --> 01:25:37.001
<v Speaker 3>menopause and how to balance female </v>
<v Speaker 3>hormones a little better since 2001 and </v>

1732
01:25:39.800 --> 01:25:44.800
<v Speaker 3>a lot of docs are listened to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of docs went into the industry to </v>

1733
01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:45.320
<v Speaker 3>make money and therefore they go to one </v>
<v Speaker 3>class,</v>

1734
01:25:45.720 --> 01:25:50.720
<v Speaker 3>one class for three days,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I just participated in and they </v>

1735
01:25:50.720 --> 01:25:54.551
<v Speaker 3>walk out and they are the expert.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't consider myself an expert on </v>

1736
01:25:54.551 --> 01:25:58.540
<v Speaker 3>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I know a little bit and try not </v>

1737
01:25:58.540 --> 01:25:59.720
<v Speaker 3>to get in trouble by keep on reading so </v>
<v Speaker 3>I know a little bit more.</v>

1738
01:25:59.780 --> 01:26:04.400
<v Speaker 3>and what I do is I go out and I share </v>
<v Speaker 3>this information I'm at and uh,</v>

1739
01:26:04.401 --> 01:26:06.260
<v Speaker 3>when I was in chicago at a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1740
01:26:06.410 --> 01:26:10.040
<v Speaker 3>teaching in medical school there and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's just my personality.</v>

1741
01:26:10.130 --> 01:26:15.130
<v Speaker 3>I read a lot and I find ways to deliver </v>
<v Speaker 3>it so it's palatable and usable in a </v>

1742
01:26:15.130 --> 01:26:18.530
<v Speaker 3>very relatively short period of time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you have to change,</v>

1743
01:26:18.570 --> 01:26:20.720
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unfortunately since 2008,</v>

1744
01:26:20.750 --> 01:26:25.750
<v Speaker 3>everything is financially oriented.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I've put my family life and the </v>

1745
01:26:25.750 --> 01:26:30.671
<v Speaker 3>quality of my life partially on the line</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I try to make it so that my </v>

1746
01:26:30.671 --> 01:26:34.910
<v Speaker 3>office comes as close as possible to </v>
<v Speaker 3>breaking even and my outside lecturing,</v>

1747
01:26:34.911 --> 01:26:39.911
<v Speaker 3>whatever is what really I get my sound.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You put in the wrong place,</v>

1748
01:26:41.150 --> 01:26:42.040
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

1749
01:26:42.220 --> 01:26:42.770
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

1750
01:26:42.890 --> 01:26:44.450
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be able to do it.</v>

1751
01:26:44.451 --> 01:26:46.070
<v Speaker 3>And our pricing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1752
01:26:47.060 --> 01:26:48.650
<v Speaker 3>the laboratory tests,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1753
01:26:48.680 --> 01:26:50.570
<v Speaker 3>patients are paying a third of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>average.</v>

1754
01:26:50.571 --> 01:26:55.571
<v Speaker 3>I'm medical director of education for </v>
<v Speaker 3>the laboratory in the lab has put a lot </v>

1755
01:26:55.571 --> 01:27:00.461
<v Speaker 3>into what I do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They support what I do by matching the </v>

1756
01:27:00.461 --> 01:27:03.911
<v Speaker 3>funds that I personally put into it so </v>
<v Speaker 3>that people like matt and I have some </v>

1757
01:27:03.911 --> 01:27:07.511
<v Speaker 3>patients who are not in the military,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not in law enforcement and other areas </v>

1758
01:27:08.211 --> 01:27:13.211
<v Speaker 3>of government government who are just </v>
<v Speaker 3>great cases that I want to,</v>

1759
01:27:14.390 --> 01:27:17.090
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to see it work and it works and I</v>

1760

<v Speaker 3>very well and this is a real labor of </v>

<v Speaker 3>you've been very adamant about this and </v>

1765
01:27:31.060 --> 01:27:34.750
<v Speaker 3>it's because of guys like matthew and </v>
<v Speaker 3>this is one of the reasons why you </v>

1766
01:27:34.750 --> 01:27:37.961
<v Speaker 3>wanted to bring matthew in here and you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You contacted me right after he started </v>

1767
01:27:37.961 --> 01:27:41.501
<v Speaker 3>treating him and right after he started </v>
<v Speaker 3>experiencing positive results and I </v>

1768
01:27:41.501 --> 01:27:41.950
<v Speaker 3>could tell that this was something that </v>
<v Speaker 3>was very important to you,</v>

1769
01:27:41.951 --> 01:27:45.410
<v Speaker 3>which is why we brought mathieu in here </v>
<v Speaker 3>to discuss this.</v>

<v Speaker 3>trying diligently for the past three,</v>

1772
01:27:52.011 --> 01:27:55.940
<v Speaker 3>four years to get some champion for what</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're doing.</v>

1773
01:27:55.941 --> 01:28:00.941
<v Speaker 3>Someone in the entertainment world to </v>
<v Speaker 3>step in and to pick this up and to </v>

<v Speaker 3>spread the word to spread,</v>
<v Speaker 3>help spread the word,</v>

1775
01:28:03.260 --> 01:28:05.420
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think without saying their names,</v>

1776
01:28:05.421 --> 01:28:07.790
<v Speaker 3>some of the people in the industry that </v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1777
01:28:07.791 --> 01:28:10.400

1778
01:28:10.401 --> 01:28:15.401
<v Speaker 3>but they don't want to be looked at as </v>
<v Speaker 3>being out there on the fringe because </v>

1779
01:28:15.620 --> 01:28:16.070
<v Speaker 3>I'm.</v>

1780

<v Speaker 3>everything I do is called evidence </v>

1781

1787

1792
01:28:51.941 --> 01:28:53.000
<v Speaker 3>testosterone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we had one of the,</v>

1793

<v Speaker 3>one of the top guys in harvard,</v>

1794
01:28:58.300 --> 01:29:01.710
<v Speaker 3>testosterone for life that refutes </v>
<v Speaker 3>testosterone causing cancer.</v>

1795

<v Speaker 3>He came to us in the beginning of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>year to an organization called age </v>

1796
01:29:06.711 --> 01:29:10.761
<v Speaker 3>management medical group and phenomenal </v>
<v Speaker 3>dissertation on the bullshit of these </v>

1797
01:29:10.761 --> 01:29:12.510
<v Speaker 3>articles showing that they show a three </v>
<v Speaker 3>percent,</v>

1798
01:29:12.780 --> 01:29:15.840
<v Speaker 3>they report a three percent increase in </v>

1799
01:29:15.841 --> 01:29:20.790
<v Speaker 3>greater heart attack onto stastrom when </v>
<v Speaker 3>the actual statistic showed a 30 percent</v>

1800
01:29:20.791 --> 01:29:25.791
<v Speaker 3>improvement,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the way they picked and choosed </v>

1801
01:29:25.791 --> 01:29:25.791
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>

1802
01:29:25.791 --> 01:29:25.791
<v Speaker 6>But hOw,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how is it the fringe?</v>

1803
01:29:25.890 --> 01:29:28.350
<v Speaker 6>These guys don't want to be perceived as</v>
<v Speaker 6>being on the fringe,</v>

1804
01:29:28.351 --> 01:29:30.570
<v Speaker 6>but they're coming to you as patients.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

1805
01:29:30.630 --> 01:29:31.860
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's what I,</v>

1806

<v Speaker 6>It's about personal image and paulo,</v>

1808
01:29:36.210 --> 01:29:41.210
<v Speaker 6>but how do you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how do you push this thing across the </v>

1809
01:29:41.210 --> 01:29:41.210
<v Speaker 6>line so it's not fringe.</v>

1810
01:29:41.210 --> 01:29:45.340
<v Speaker 3>I've been on the phone with them </v>
<v Speaker 3>frequently trying to get them if they </v>

1811
01:29:45.340 --> 01:29:46.970
<v Speaker 3>don't want to stand up and be a </v>
<v Speaker 3>participant,</v>

1815
01:29:52.851 --> 01:29:55.040
<v Speaker 6>especially something like this where </v>
<v Speaker 6>it's a long form,</v>

1816
01:29:55.280 --> 01:29:57.930
<v Speaker 6>uninterrupted conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you could really get deep into the facts</v>

1817
01:29:57.931 --> 01:29:59.810
<v Speaker 6>and the reality and your anecdotal </v>
<v Speaker 6>experience.</v>

1818
01:29:59.830 --> 01:30:01.600
<v Speaker 6>Controversy is not new to you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1819
01:30:01.980 --> 01:30:04.520
<v Speaker 6>Everything I do is controversial.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't worry about it.</v>

01:30:04.850 --> 01:30:06.800
<v Speaker 6>What's the hottest controversy are in </v>
<v Speaker 6>right now?</v>

1821
01:30:06.860 --> 01:30:09.710
<v Speaker 6>I don't know if it's cage fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 6>forcing people to eat animal.</v>

1822
01:30:09.711 --> 01:30:14.270
<v Speaker 6>Dick's dirty jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean a pot advocacy.</v>

1823
01:30:14.590 --> 01:30:19.590
<v Speaker 6>I mean I don't have a single thing that </v>
<v Speaker 6>I do that doesn't have somebody hating </v>

1824
01:30:19.590 --> 01:30:19.780
<v Speaker 6>me,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so it's okay enough yet,</v>

1825
01:30:20.770 --> 01:30:23.290
<v Speaker 6>but I've been through after everything </v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm saying though.</v>

1826
01:30:23.360 --> 01:30:25.100
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think we're good at everything.</v>

1827
01:30:25.101 --> 01:30:26.010
<v Speaker 6>I'm saying no.</v>
<v Speaker 6>W,</v>

1828
01:30:26.011 --> 01:30:27.920
<v Speaker 6>w,</v>
<v Speaker 6>w regardless of whatever it is,</v>

1829
01:30:28.340 --> 01:30:30.530
<v Speaker 6>whatever the subject is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This was what I truly believe.</v>

1830
01:30:30.531 --> 01:30:35.531
<v Speaker 6>I don't have any other motivations,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so I'm fine with the controversy and I </v>

1831
01:30:35.661 --> 01:30:40.661
<v Speaker 6>think hormones have a stigma in this </v>
<v Speaker 6>country because of barry ponds and </v>

1832
01:30:40.671 --> 01:30:43.820
<v Speaker 6>fucking sammy sosa and all this crazy </v>
<v Speaker 6>shit where everybody's like,</v>

1833
01:30:43.821 --> 01:30:45.710
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this fucking cheaters in baseball.</v>

1834
01:30:45.710 --> 01:30:50.710
<v Speaker 6>They ruined everything and sports and </v>
<v Speaker 6>everyone is so concerned with what we </v>

1835
01:30:51.141 --> 01:30:54.470
<v Speaker 6>hear about with cheating and steroids </v>
<v Speaker 6>and athletic performance.</v>

1836
01:30:54.471 --> 01:30:59.471
<v Speaker 6>That means you're missing out on a core </v>
<v Speaker 6>essential aspect of being a human being.</v>

1837
01:31:00.110 --> 01:31:05.110
<v Speaker 6>Being a man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>especially the lack of testosterone </v>

1838
01:31:05.110 --> 01:31:08.340
<v Speaker 6>directly related to depression,</v>
<v Speaker 6>directly related to these.</v>

1839
01:31:08.650 --> 01:31:13.250
<v Speaker 6>These people that start hitting age </v>
<v Speaker 6>regardless of traumatic brain injury,</v>

1840
01:31:13.370 --> 01:31:16.520
<v Speaker 6>they start getting older and they feel </v>
<v Speaker 6>like fucking shit.</v>

1841
01:31:16.670 --> 01:31:19.010
<v Speaker 6>They feel like shit and I've talked to a</v>
<v Speaker 6>lot of them.</v>

1842
01:31:19.011 --> 01:31:22.040
<v Speaker 6>They get on testosterone and all of a </v>
<v Speaker 6>sudden their glow again.</v>

1843
01:31:22.041 --> 01:31:24.680
<v Speaker 6>They have energy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They want to start doing things.</v>

1844
01:31:24.681 --> 01:31:28.520
<v Speaker 6>There are active and someone I've talked</v>
<v Speaker 6>to,</v>

1845
01:31:28.521 --> 01:31:33.521
<v Speaker 6>guys who are on testosterone that don't </v>
<v Speaker 6>like to talk about it because they're </v>

1846
01:31:33.521 --> 01:31:37.271
<v Speaker 6>worried that someone's going to look at </v>
<v Speaker 6>them first of all as being inferior </v>

1847
01:31:37.271 --> 01:31:40.691
<v Speaker 6>because they need to add artificial </v>
<v Speaker 6>testosterone to their system and that </v>

1848
01:31:41.240 --> 01:31:46.240
<v Speaker 6>they might be a roid head.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Now they might be a cheater and some </v>

1849
01:31:46.240 --> 01:31:46.240
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what are you fucking playing?</v>

1850

<v Speaker 6>You're life cheater.</v>

<v Speaker 6>meanwhile you'll take aspirin if you </v>

<v Speaker 6>you take ibuprofen,</v>

1854
01:31:57.110 --> 01:32:00.790
<v Speaker 6>you'll take medication if you're sick,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like why won't you take testosterone?</v>

1855
01:32:00.791 --> 01:32:03.070
<v Speaker 6>Why won't you get your hormone levels </v>
<v Speaker 6>change?</v>

1856
01:32:03.071 --> 01:32:08.071
<v Speaker 6>I have a very good friend that won't do </v>
<v Speaker 6>it because he's afraid of all these </v>

1857
01:32:08.071 --> 01:32:08.071
<v Speaker 6>other things,</v>

<v Speaker 7>bro.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You look like shit and you're tired all </v>

1859

<v Speaker 7>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>

1860
01:32:12.770 --> 01:32:13.900
<v Speaker 7>Like what are you worried about?</v>
<v Speaker 7>But the,</v>

1861
01:32:13.910 --> 01:32:18.910
<v Speaker 7>and the difference to me is like us </v>
<v Speaker 7>being there and these guys who like I </v>

1862
01:32:19.141 --> 01:32:24.141
<v Speaker 7>sat down with a guy two weeks ago,</v>
<v Speaker 7>wrote a script about a metal for the </v>

1863
01:32:24.141 --> 01:32:24.141
<v Speaker 7>first time.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Lovely guy,</v>

1864
01:32:24.141 --> 01:32:25.710
<v Speaker 7>like the sweetest,</v>
<v Speaker 7>sweetest,</v>

1865
01:32:25.711 --> 01:32:30.711
<v Speaker 7>nicest guy,</v>
<v Speaker 7>loves the fish and all this and I'm </v>

1866
01:32:30.711 --> 01:32:33.291
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so how is it like we really get down to </v>

1867
01:32:33.291 --> 01:32:33.291
<v Speaker 7>basics.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He's like,</v>

1868
01:32:33.291 --> 01:32:33.291
<v Speaker 7>it's good man,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's good,</v>

1869
01:32:33.291 --> 01:32:38.000
<v Speaker 7>but some days I just have to find a </v>
<v Speaker 7>reason to go on living and you're just </v>

1870
01:32:38.761 --> 01:32:43.761
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you understand at that point how </v>

1871
01:32:43.761 --> 01:32:45.930
<v Speaker 7>different it is for these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 7>how much more drastic it is,</v>

1872
01:32:46.110 --> 01:32:49.980
<v Speaker 7>how much more important it is to reach </v>
<v Speaker 7>out to these guys and,</v>

1873
01:32:49.990 --> 01:32:50.230
<v Speaker 7>and</v>

1874
01:32:51.160 --> 01:32:52.500
<v Speaker 6>somebody's got to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

1875
01:32:52.501 --> 01:32:54.720
<v Speaker 6>this is a subject is very near and dear </v>
<v Speaker 6>to my heart,</v>

1876
01:32:54.721 --> 01:32:59.450
<v Speaker 6>both because I know a lot of guys in the</v>
<v Speaker 6>military from martial arts and just from</v>

1877
01:32:59.790 --> 01:33:04.790
<v Speaker 6>life in general and I know a lot of guys</v>
<v Speaker 6>have had head trauma from fighting and </v>

1878
01:33:04.790 --> 01:33:06.450
<v Speaker 6>I've had a bunch of head trauma myself.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So explains it.</v>

1879
01:33:06.480 --> 01:33:09.330
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm sure there's some bad shit going on.</v>

1880
01:33:09.331 --> 01:33:12.090
<v Speaker 6>There must be.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It doesn't make any sense,</v>

1881
01:33:12.750 --> 01:33:15.720
<v Speaker 6>but it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's a subject that's very near and dear</v>

1882
01:33:15.721 --> 01:33:20.721
<v Speaker 6>to my heart.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And once we started getting into it and </v>

1883
01:33:20.721 --> 01:33:22.911
<v Speaker 6>we started discussing it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it was very confusing to me that it </v>

1884
01:33:22.911 --> 01:33:22.920
<v Speaker 6>wasn't hearing this echoed in other </v>
<v Speaker 6>places.</v>

1885
01:33:22.921 --> 01:33:27.921
<v Speaker 6>And when sometimes when you hear things </v>
<v Speaker 6>and you don't hear it echoed in other </v>

1886
01:33:27.921 --> 01:33:27.921
<v Speaker 6>places,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you say,</v>

1887
01:33:27.921 --> 01:33:28.410
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>maybe I'm talking to a crackpot.</v>

1888
01:33:28.680 --> 01:33:33.680
<v Speaker 6>Maybe this guy's fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's just try to get everybody on the </v>

1889
01:33:33.680 --> 01:33:33.680
<v Speaker 6>juice.</v>

1890
01:33:34.450 --> 01:33:38.670
<v Speaker 6>But when you look,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when you research it and you find the,</v>

1891
01:33:38.790 --> 01:33:42.960
<v Speaker 6>all the hypocrisy and the contradictions</v>
<v Speaker 6>involved in the,</v>

1892
01:33:43.050 --> 01:33:44.890
<v Speaker 6>the counteracting of it or the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1893
01:33:45.170 --> 01:33:49.140
<v Speaker 6>the people who are against it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you start realizing like,</v>

1894
01:33:49.141 --> 01:33:54.141
<v Speaker 6>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is not a rationally approach </v>

1895
01:33:54.141 --> 01:33:56.361
<v Speaker 6>subject.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is a subject that for whatever </v>

1896
01:33:56.361 --> 01:33:58.941
<v Speaker 6>reason is either the people who were </v>
<v Speaker 6>talking about it or ignorant of it,</v>

1897
01:33:59.550 --> 01:34:01.380
<v Speaker 6>they don't have personal experience in </v>
<v Speaker 6>it.</v>

1898
01:34:01.381 --> 01:34:06.381
<v Speaker 6>They don't have,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they don't have a conversation with a </v>

1899
01:34:06.381 --> 01:34:07.590
<v Speaker 6>guy like you that has spent decades </v>
<v Speaker 6>working on this stuff.</v>

1900
01:34:07.970 --> 01:34:09.240
<v Speaker 6>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is not.</v>

1901
01:34:09.660 --> 01:34:14.310
<v Speaker 6>This is not a really well understood </v>
<v Speaker 6>subject for a lot of physicians.</v>

1902
01:34:16.020 --> 01:34:21.020
<v Speaker 3>They don't have pharmaceutical reps </v>
<v Speaker 3>coming in and telling them that they </v>

1903
01:34:21.020 --> 01:34:22.400
<v Speaker 3>need to replace testosterone for </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever reason.</v>

1904
01:34:22.470 --> 01:34:24.870
<v Speaker 3>We're stArting to see it with an issue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1905
01:34:24.871 --> 01:34:26.700
<v Speaker 3>The pharmaceutical reps coming into the </v>
<v Speaker 3>offices.</v>

1906
01:34:26.730 --> 01:34:31.730
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which doesn't make any sense because </v>

1907
01:34:31.730 --> 01:34:32.340
<v Speaker 3>there are what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The underarm deodorant to testosterone.</v>

1908
01:34:32.370 --> 01:34:34.980
<v Speaker 3>There's the rub on deodorant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>testosterone.</v>

1909
01:34:35.150 --> 01:34:40.150
<v Speaker 3>It's a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It looks like an underarm deodorant </v>

1910
01:34:40.150 --> 01:34:42.711
<v Speaker 3>thing to try to avoid contaminating your</v>
<v Speaker 3>loved ones with excessive amount of </v>

1911
01:34:42.711 --> 01:34:46.080
<v Speaker 3>testosterone cream.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Put all of your body.</v>

1912
01:34:46.081 --> 01:34:49.020
<v Speaker 3>We don't use any creams per se,</v>
<v Speaker 3>except for fun issues.</v>

1913
01:34:49.170 --> 01:34:50.520
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't take how dare you.</v>

1914
01:34:51.600 --> 01:34:56.600
<v Speaker 3>Don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The creams have also some sort of an </v>

1915
01:34:56.600 --> 01:34:56.620
<v Speaker 3>absorption issue as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1916
01:34:56.621 --> 01:35:01.621
<v Speaker 3>what happens is when you put a cream,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a 10 percent or five percent gel or </v>

1917
01:35:01.621 --> 01:35:04.250
<v Speaker 3>cream of testosterone and skin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the little hair follicles have an enzyme</v>

1918
01:35:04.251 --> 01:35:07.160
<v Speaker 3>in it that converted from testosterone </v>
<v Speaker 3>to dihydrotestosterone,</v>

1919
01:35:07.400 --> 01:35:10.520
<v Speaker 3>which is the active form of testosterone</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you want in the cell,</v>

1920
01:35:10.550 --> 01:35:13.820
<v Speaker 3>not floating around in the blood to </v>
<v Speaker 3>cause loss of hair.</v>

1921
01:35:13.820 --> 01:35:17.410
<v Speaker 3>At one point in my head,</v>
<v Speaker 3>motherfucking loss,</v>

1922
01:35:18.140 --> 01:35:23.140
<v Speaker 3>loss of hair,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shrinkage of the testicles pointed me </v>

1923
01:35:23.170 --> 01:35:28.170
<v Speaker 3>again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Plenty large was set over there at your </v>

1924
01:35:28.201 --> 01:35:33.201
<v Speaker 3>monster over there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The werewolf and the world will and a </v>

1925
01:35:33.201 --> 01:35:33.500
<v Speaker 3>enlargement of the prostate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1926
01:35:33.960 --> 01:35:36.950
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for women,</v>

1927
01:35:36.970 --> 01:35:39.790
<v Speaker 3>enlargement of the clutter is not bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an imbalance,</v>

1928
01:35:39.990 --> 01:35:44.990
<v Speaker 3>an imbalance or lack of dht along with </v>
<v Speaker 3>the too much dht instead of having free </v>

1929
01:35:44.990 --> 01:35:45.920
<v Speaker 3>testosterone that you need to get into </v>
<v Speaker 3>the brain.</v>

1930
01:35:46.190 --> 01:35:51.190
<v Speaker 3>So we have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're interacting with some other </v>

1931
01:35:51.190 --> 01:35:51.200
<v Speaker 3>delivery technologies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1932
01:35:51.210 --> 01:35:54.350
<v Speaker 3>aside from injectable and topical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1933
01:35:54.351 --> 01:35:59.351
<v Speaker 3>that increases the amount of </v>
<v Speaker 3>testosterone that gets into the brain </v>

1934
01:35:59.351 --> 01:36:00.970
<v Speaker 3>and we see the major benefits in our tbi</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1935
01:36:00.971 --> 01:36:05.971
<v Speaker 3>or a head trauma,</v>
<v Speaker 3>neuro trauma patients where they do </v>

1936
01:36:05.971 --> 01:36:05.971
<v Speaker 3>phenomenally well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it seems that,</v>

1937
01:36:06.710 --> 01:36:11.710
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't seem that there's a whole </v>

1938
01:36:11.710 --> 01:36:15.190
<v Speaker 3>panel of things that have to be balanced</v>
<v Speaker 3>out in order for you to have a said </v>

1939
01:36:16.280 --> 01:36:17.090
<v Speaker 3>happy body.</v>

1940
01:36:17.090 --> 01:36:19.520
<v Speaker 3>You said at the beginning of a holistic </v>
<v Speaker 3>approach,</v>

1941
01:36:20.060 --> 01:36:23.870
<v Speaker 3>you need to have physical activity and </v>
<v Speaker 3>nutrition and you have to have a balance</v>

1942
01:36:23.871 --> 01:36:28.871
<v Speaker 3>of everything you take into your body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whether or not it's A medication or a </v>

1943
01:36:28.871 --> 01:36:30.200
<v Speaker 3>hormone or a mineral or vitamin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You sent me another thing.</v>

1944
01:36:30.201 --> 01:36:35.201
<v Speaker 3>This is very important to talk about </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I sent it to a buddy who was </v>

1945
01:36:35.201 --> 01:36:35.480
<v Speaker 3>experiencing some depression that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>sent me,</v>

1946
01:36:35.481 --> 01:36:39.320
<v Speaker 3>something about propecia or [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 3>or whatever,</v>

1947
01:36:39.321 --> 01:36:44.321
<v Speaker 3>the finasteride finasteride and dressed </v>
<v Speaker 3>drive direction that has been shown to </v>

1948
01:36:45.591 --> 01:36:50.591
<v Speaker 3>cause depression in people and I have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>buddy who got on that shit and he was </v>

1949
01:36:50.591 --> 01:36:53.330
<v Speaker 3>experiencing some hair loss.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Get on that shit and became really,</v>

1950
01:36:53.480 --> 01:36:58.160
<v Speaker 3>really depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The reason being is that to stop when it</v>

1951
01:36:58.161 --> 01:37:03.161
<v Speaker 3>gets into the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>goes through a cascade of changes from </v>

1952
01:37:03.161 --> 01:37:05.090
<v Speaker 3>testosterone to dihydrotestosterone 300 </v>
<v Speaker 3>scenic diane,</v>

1953
01:37:05.390 --> 01:37:08.300
<v Speaker 3>and then it stimulates a chemical called</v>
<v Speaker 3>adenyl cyclase,</v>

1954
01:37:08.330 --> 01:37:10.220
<v Speaker 3>which gives us our upgrade feeling.</v>

1955
01:37:10.580 --> 01:37:12.620
<v Speaker 3>And when you block the conversion of </v>
<v Speaker 3>testosterone,</v>

1956
01:37:12.621 --> 01:37:15.530
<v Speaker 3>dht,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you lose all that stuff down the road.</v>

1957
01:37:15.770 --> 01:37:18.350
<v Speaker 3>So you can have issues with anger,</v>
<v Speaker 3>depression.</v>

1958
01:37:18.620 --> 01:37:23.620
<v Speaker 3>We have a couple of people who were </v>
<v Speaker 3>developed it within a short period of </v>

1959
01:37:23.620 --> 01:37:28.121
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like 18 months on the finance </v>

1960
01:37:28.121 --> 01:37:29.720
<v Speaker 3>finasteride and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1961
01:37:30.170 --> 01:37:33.800
<v Speaker 3>had to put them onto hcg little clomid </v>
<v Speaker 3>and a little testosterone.</v>

1962
01:37:34.130 --> 01:37:35.480
<v Speaker 3>Six months,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're back in line.</v>

1963
01:37:35.810 --> 01:37:38.060
<v Speaker 3>They were depressed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'd lost their libido.</v>

1964
01:37:39.490 --> 01:37:42.590
<v Speaker 3>And it's because the effect of dht and </v>
<v Speaker 3>testosterone,</v>

1965
01:37:42.600 --> 01:37:47.600
<v Speaker 3>the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>testosterone and growth hormone also </v>

1966
01:37:47.600 --> 01:37:47.600
<v Speaker 3>work in an area of the brain for memory </v>
<v Speaker 3>recall,</v>

1967
01:37:47.600 --> 01:37:51.521
<v Speaker 3>and the ability to learn new things </v>
<v Speaker 3>called the hippocampus also are </v>

1968
01:37:51.521 --> 01:37:52.730
<v Speaker 3>panoramic vision and our panoramic </v>
<v Speaker 3>memories.</v>

1969
01:37:52.731 --> 01:37:56.280
<v Speaker 3>So you look at something panoramic or </v>
<v Speaker 3>you have a sequence of,</v>

1970
01:37:56.340 --> 01:37:57.290
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1971
01:37:57.680 --> 01:38:02.680
<v Speaker 3>of memories that you can lose if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>lose your testosterone in the perry </v>

1972
01:38:02.680 --> 01:38:05.610
<v Speaker 3>campus area of the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it also kills your dick like pesticide.</v>

1973
01:38:05.900 --> 01:38:06.690
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dah di,</v>

1974
01:38:07.200 --> 01:38:09.480
<v Speaker 3>that fucking that print finasteride </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>

1975
01:38:09.510 --> 01:38:11.880
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's because dht is important.</v>

1976
01:38:12.510 --> 01:38:14.790
<v Speaker 3>Testosterone's important dht in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>brain.</v>

1977
01:38:15.180 --> 01:38:20.180
<v Speaker 3>So when you use stuff that converts the </v>
<v Speaker 3>dht in from the application on the skin,</v>

1978
01:38:20.281 --> 01:38:22.230
<v Speaker 3>it gets into the blood but doesn't get </v>
<v Speaker 3>into the brain.</v>

1979
01:38:22.560 --> 01:38:25.140
<v Speaker 3>So you have to generate your dht in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>brain,</v>

1980
01:38:25.170 --> 01:38:27.000
<v Speaker 3>in the cells,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not in the blood.</v>

1981
01:38:27.510 --> 01:38:31.200
<v Speaker 3>And when I look at people who are on </v>
<v Speaker 3>some of the topical products out there,</v>

1982
01:38:31.201 --> 01:38:35.760
<v Speaker 3>you see free testosterone's good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Total testosterone is outrageously high.</v>

1983
01:38:35.761 --> 01:38:40.761
<v Speaker 3>Dht is sky high.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they're wondering why their hair's </v>

1984
01:38:40.761 --> 01:38:43.250
<v Speaker 3>falling out in handfuls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Almost their testicles are disappearing </v>

1985
01:38:43.250 --> 01:38:43.250
<v Speaker 3>or else,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

1986
01:38:43.680 --> 01:38:47.610
<v Speaker 3>But they are straight strengths up </v>
<v Speaker 3>strength from dhd,</v>

1987
01:38:47.640 --> 01:38:50.820
<v Speaker 3>but it's this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this pill that makes your hair fall out.</v>

1988
01:38:50.821 --> 01:38:55.821
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's one of those things like if </v>

1989
01:38:55.821 --> 01:38:55.821
<v Speaker 3>someone could come up with a pill that </v>
<v Speaker 3>makes you,</v>

1990
01:38:55.821 --> 01:38:56.220
<v Speaker 3>that keeps your hair from falling out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>boy,</v>

1991
01:38:56.221 --> 01:38:57.780
<v Speaker 3>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a very popular thing.</v>

1992
01:38:57.990 --> 01:38:59.840
<v Speaker 3>And then you look at the side effects.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1993
01:38:59.850 --> 01:39:04.850
<v Speaker 3>don't give it a pregnant woman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your fucking kids going to be fucked up </v>

1994
01:39:04.850 --> 01:39:05.220
<v Speaker 3>if she touches it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you can't even touch it if you're a</v>

1995
01:39:05.221 --> 01:39:10.221
<v Speaker 3>pregnant woman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like don't take something that a woman </v>

1996
01:39:10.221 --> 01:39:14.001
<v Speaker 3>can't even touch when she's pregnant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the reason is that they found that </v>

1997
01:39:14.001 --> 01:39:14.001
<v Speaker 3>d,</v>
<v Speaker 3>h,</v>

1998
01:39:14.001 --> 01:39:17.820
<v Speaker 3>d helps to distinguish the brain's </v>
<v Speaker 3>gender orientation,</v>

1999
01:39:19.350 --> 01:39:21.240
<v Speaker 3>dht,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dihydrotestosterone,</v>

2000
01:39:21.780 --> 01:39:25.610
<v Speaker 3>gender orientation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that you can have externally a,</v>

2001
01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:27.000
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2002
01:39:27.200 --> 01:39:32.200
<v Speaker 3>a male body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But If female mentality woe and it's </v>

2003
01:39:32.200 --> 01:39:36.650
<v Speaker 3>biochemical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>so do you think that this is a maybe </v>

2004
01:39:36.650 --> 01:39:40.520
<v Speaker 3>possibly related to transgender people </v>
<v Speaker 3>that are there that say they were born a</v>

2005
01:39:41.551 --> 01:39:45.810
<v Speaker 3>man physically but they brought born the</v>
<v Speaker 3>wrong sex dht related?</v>

2006
01:39:45.811 --> 01:39:47.100
<v Speaker 3>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's it.</v>

2007
01:39:47.250 --> 01:39:49.170
<v Speaker 3>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe in the social,</v>

2008
01:39:49.171 --> 01:39:50.550
<v Speaker 3>cultural reasons for it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2009
01:39:50.551 --> 01:39:53.230
<v Speaker 3>someone becoming a homosexual or lesbian</v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

2010
01:39:53.310 --> 01:39:56.340
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a ptsd kind of response.</v>

2011
01:39:56.340 --> 01:40:01.340
<v Speaker 3>I use the data.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A gal who was a lesbian who would just </v>

2012
01:40:01.340 --> 01:40:01.340
<v Speaker 3>go out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2013
01:40:01.500 --> 01:40:04.170
<v Speaker 3>it was my goal to fix her if she needed </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be who she was,</v>

2014
01:40:04.320 --> 01:40:05.810
<v Speaker 3>but she had been raped.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm kidding.</v>

2015
01:40:05.820 --> 01:40:06.540
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know you were.</v>

2016
01:40:06.900 --> 01:40:10.260
<v Speaker 3>She had been raped multiple times when </v>
<v Speaker 3>she lived in this country.</v>

2017
01:40:10.261 --> 01:40:13.350
<v Speaker 3>That's always conflicting over there in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the east area.</v>

2018
01:40:14.210 --> 01:40:14.780
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

2019
01:40:14.781 --> 01:40:15.950
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

2020
01:40:16.020 --> 01:40:20.170
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but middle east area and you know,</v>

2021
01:40:20.400 --> 01:40:25.400
<v Speaker 3>that country that everyone's picking on </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's a warmonger income country </v>

2022
01:40:25.400 --> 01:40:27.090
<v Speaker 3>and creates all the wars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Syria,</v>

2023
01:40:27.600 --> 01:40:28.580
<v Speaker 3>Israel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Israel.</v>

2024
01:40:28.900 --> 01:40:31.830
<v Speaker 3>So she was raped in Israel bite.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh god.</v>

2025
01:40:31.831 --> 01:40:33.920
<v Speaker 3>Some people there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

2026
01:40:34.140 --> 01:40:37.170
<v Speaker 3>she feared men,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she had a ptsd.</v>

2027
01:40:37.171 --> 01:40:42.171
<v Speaker 3>Every time she got close with the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she would freak out and she didn't have </v>

2028
01:40:42.171 --> 01:40:42.171
<v Speaker 3>it with women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that was,</v>

2029
01:40:42.310 --> 01:40:43.110
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the pts.</v>

2030
01:40:43.111 --> 01:40:44.590
<v Speaker 3>But I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2031
01:40:44.591 --> 01:40:45.720
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they say it's a choice.</v>

2032
01:40:45.720 --> 01:40:50.720
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's a choice in all the </v>

2033
01:40:50.720 --> 01:40:50.970
<v Speaker 3>cases.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think in the transgender they were put</v>

2034
01:40:50.971 --> 01:40:55.971
<v Speaker 3>into the wrong body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Their mindset was in the wrong body or </v>

2035
01:40:55.971 --> 01:40:58.861
<v Speaker 3>their body was right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The mindset was treated with hormones </v>

2036
01:40:58.861 --> 01:40:58.861
<v Speaker 3>that created the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the other gender,</v>

2037
01:40:59.170 --> 01:41:02.200
<v Speaker 3>and they're fulfilling it by transgender</v>
<v Speaker 3>surgery.</v>

2038
01:41:02.250 --> 01:41:04.450
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I worked in Thailand for the past,</v>

2039
01:41:04.451 --> 01:41:09.451
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>four years going back to starting the </v>

2040
01:41:09.451 --> 01:41:11.581
<v Speaker 3>project and was exposed to a lot of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>transgender or the gender reassignment </v>

2041
01:41:12.050 --> 01:41:15.560
<v Speaker 3>individuals relative to hormones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

2042
01:41:16.900 --> 01:41:19.990
<v Speaker 3>there were people who were in the wrong </v>
<v Speaker 3>body.</v>

2043
01:41:20.410 --> 01:41:24.740
<v Speaker 3>I mean their physical expression in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>opposite.</v>

2044
01:41:24.741 --> 01:41:29.741
<v Speaker 3>Then sex they were born in was obviously</v>
<v Speaker 3>the wrong body and they went through </v>

2045
01:41:29.741 --> 01:41:30.730
<v Speaker 3>surgery to have things corrected for </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

2046
01:41:31.290 --> 01:41:35.010
<v Speaker 6>And do you think this is related to </v>
<v Speaker 6>these hormones in the wound?</v>

2047
01:41:35.110 --> 01:41:37.330
<v Speaker 3>I think it's hormones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It could be,</v>

2048
01:41:37.520 --> 01:41:38.800
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>alcohol,</v>

2049
01:41:38.801 --> 01:41:40.210
<v Speaker 3>cocaine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>crack,</v>

2050
01:41:40.211 --> 01:41:42.700
<v Speaker 3>meth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any kind of chemistry that is introduced</v>

2051
01:41:42.701 --> 01:41:45.820
<v Speaker 3>to the woman's body during that very </v>
<v Speaker 3>frightful period of time,</v>

2052
01:41:45.821 --> 01:41:50.821
<v Speaker 3>the first seven weeks where everything </v>
<v Speaker 3>starts developing and the change in </v>

2053
01:41:50.821 --> 01:41:54.991
<v Speaker 3>hormones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether or not it's externally </v>

2054
01:41:54.991 --> 01:41:57.000
<v Speaker 3>introduced or internally manufactured </v>
<v Speaker 3>because of things that they've been </v>

2055
01:41:57.000 --> 01:42:01.081
<v Speaker 3>taken into their body like alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which can alter chemistry or smoking </v>

2056
01:42:01.081 --> 01:42:03.190
<v Speaker 3>weed that can cause an elevation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Esther dialed levels.</v>

2057
01:42:03.400 --> 01:42:06.220
<v Speaker 3>And if you have elevation to dial dial </v>
<v Speaker 3>levels in a,</v>

2058
01:42:06.280 --> 01:42:11.280
<v Speaker 3>in a male,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can predispose them to be female </v>

2059
01:42:11.280 --> 01:42:11.800
<v Speaker 3>brain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>physiologically male,</v>

2060
01:42:12.010 --> 01:42:13.240
<v Speaker 3>female in mental.</v>

2061
01:42:14.160 --> 01:42:19.160
<v Speaker 6>This is an issue that a lot of people </v>
<v Speaker 6>get very emotional about when you're </v>

2062
01:42:19.160 --> 01:42:20.930
<v Speaker 6>talking about transgender folks.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And yes,</v>

2063
01:42:21.400 --> 01:42:26.400
<v Speaker 6>and when you break it down to a chemical</v>
<v Speaker 6>relationship and you break it down to </v>

2064
01:42:27.510 --> 01:42:28.200
<v Speaker 6>this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what,</v>

2065
01:42:28.220 --> 01:42:31.590
<v Speaker 6>what you're saying about the </v>
<v Speaker 6>introduction of the certain chemicals in</v>

2066
01:42:31.591 --> 01:42:33.480
<v Speaker 6>the womb,</v>
<v Speaker 6>people resist this information.</v>

2067
01:42:33.950 --> 01:42:36.890
<v Speaker 3>Yes they do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They like to say that,</v>

2068
01:42:36.940 --> 01:42:40.670
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're always female.</v>

2069
01:42:40.890 --> 01:42:45.050
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they want to be female or male or male.</v>

2070
01:42:45.410 --> 01:42:48.200
<v Speaker 3>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just preference or female regardless.</v>

2071
01:42:48.800 --> 01:42:50.470
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2072
01:42:50.480 --> 01:42:53.600
<v Speaker 3>it's a very heated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very emotional because you don't want to</v>

2073
01:42:53.601 --> 01:42:57.380
<v Speaker 3>have that doubt that they were a male.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want to eliminate the fact that they</v>

2074
01:42:57.381 --> 01:42:59.950
<v Speaker 3>were a male and that there are female,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as you know,</v>

2075
01:42:59.951 --> 01:43:01.130
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in mma.</v>

2076
01:43:01.131 --> 01:43:02.450
<v Speaker 3>The situation that's going on,</v>

2077
01:43:02.700 --> 01:43:07.700
<v Speaker 6>the situation that I'm involved in,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well I'm involved in it because I was </v>

2078
01:43:07.700 --> 01:43:09.030
<v Speaker 6>one of many people that thought it was </v>
<v Speaker 6>incorrect.</v>

2079
01:43:09.150 --> 01:43:14.150
<v Speaker 6>There's a woman that was born a man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She was a man for 30 years and then had </v>

2080
01:43:14.970 --> 01:43:17.160
<v Speaker 6>gender reassignment surgery two years </v>
<v Speaker 6>later.</v>

2081
01:43:17.161 --> 01:43:22.161
<v Speaker 6>It was fighting women in mma fights.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Never fought as a man and he's fighting </v>

2082
01:43:22.161 --> 01:43:23.730
<v Speaker 6>and beating the fuck out of these checks</v>
<v Speaker 6>and not letting them know.</v>

2083
01:43:23.780 --> 01:43:26.190
<v Speaker 6>The first two,</v>
<v Speaker 6>at least that she used to be a man,</v>

2084
01:43:26.490 --> 01:43:28.260
<v Speaker 6>which I thought was just completely </v>
<v Speaker 6>incorrect.</v>

2085
01:43:28.320 --> 01:43:33.240
<v Speaker 6>And I based it on my knowledge of </v>
<v Speaker 6>martial arts,</v>

2086
01:43:33.450 --> 01:43:38.450
<v Speaker 6>my knowledge of things like the size of </v>
<v Speaker 6>hands and shoulders and the different </v>

2087
01:43:38.450 --> 01:43:41.370
<v Speaker 6>relationship that the body parts of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>hips,</v>

2088
01:43:41.540 --> 01:43:46.540
<v Speaker 6>there's the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's the structure of a male body is </v>

2089
01:43:46.540 --> 01:43:47.610
<v Speaker 6>very different.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then if you take steroids,</v>

2090
01:43:48.060 --> 01:43:51.060
<v Speaker 6>one of the things about steroids that's </v>
<v Speaker 6>hugely problematic,</v>

2091
01:43:51.170 --> 01:43:56.170
<v Speaker 6>people that cheated and then don't cheat</v>
<v Speaker 6>anymore is that when you cheat,</v>

2092
01:43:56.450 --> 01:44:01.450
<v Speaker 6>when you take steroids,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I'm not talking just about </v>

2093
01:44:01.450 --> 01:44:04.301
<v Speaker 6>testosterone and talking to them like </v>
<v Speaker 6>real radical steroids and a lot of </v>

2094
01:44:04.301 --> 01:44:06.350
<v Speaker 6>people taken you enact permanent changes</v>
<v Speaker 6>to your body,</v>

2095
01:44:06.650 --> 01:44:11.650
<v Speaker 6>not just permanent changes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but permanent changes that improve the </v>

2096
01:44:11.650 --> 01:44:12.560
<v Speaker 6>performance of your body forever.</v>

2097
01:44:12.830 --> 01:44:15.080
<v Speaker 6>You there,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's been many studies that have come</v>

2098
01:44:15.081 --> 01:44:18.050
<v Speaker 6>out recently that people have taken </v>
<v Speaker 6>steroids,</v>

2099
01:44:18.051 --> 01:44:23.051
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>x amount of years ago and been off them </v>

2100
01:44:23.051 --> 01:44:25.091
<v Speaker 6>for a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 6>still have the benefits of taking those </v>

2101
01:44:25.091 --> 01:44:27.440
<v Speaker 6>steroids.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you've taken 30 years of testosterone</v>

2102
01:44:27.441 --> 01:44:32.441
<v Speaker 6>in a male frame,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm a male frame which has different </v>

2103
01:44:32.441 --> 01:44:33.410
<v Speaker 6>tendons,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which has different,</v>

2104
01:44:33.510 --> 01:44:38.510
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>different jaw structure which changes </v>

2105
01:44:38.510 --> 01:44:40.820
<v Speaker 6>your ability to absorb punishment.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Two years of estrogen therapy.</v>

2106
01:44:41.210 --> 01:44:42.680
<v Speaker 6>How much of that is going to change that</v>

2107
01:44:43.730 --> 01:44:45.470
<v Speaker 3>externally?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'll change.</v>

2108
01:44:46.100 --> 01:44:50.630
<v Speaker 3>Estrogen has a counteract some of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Benefits of testosterone.</v>

2109
01:44:50.631 --> 01:44:55.631
<v Speaker 3>So the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is there also supplementation of </v>

2110
01:44:55.631 --> 01:44:56.880
<v Speaker 3>testosterone at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it taking estrogen or are they using gas</v>

2111
01:44:56.990 --> 01:45:00.140
<v Speaker 3>testosterone to convert into estrogen as</v>
<v Speaker 3>a means of getting their estrogen?</v>

2112
01:45:00.500 --> 01:45:03.790
<v Speaker 3>You'd have to look at how they're being </v>
<v Speaker 3>treated and you know,</v>

2113
01:45:03.800 --> 01:45:08.030
<v Speaker 3>their personal selection of what </v>
<v Speaker 3>cocktail of hormones that are taking.</v>

2114
01:45:08.480 --> 01:45:13.480
<v Speaker 3>Usually what happens is [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 3>acetate is a drug that's used to block </v>

2115
01:45:14.451 --> 01:45:19.451
<v Speaker 3>the androgen receptors so that a woman </v>
<v Speaker 3>can develop the or transgender woman can</v>

2116
01:45:19.791 --> 01:45:23.240
<v Speaker 3>develop the softness and the femininity </v>
<v Speaker 3>of her body.</v>

2117
01:45:23.720 --> 01:45:28.720
<v Speaker 3>But if the individual,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the transgender female as a female </v>

2118
01:45:29.570 --> 01:45:34.370
<v Speaker 3>maintains a lot of the muscle striations</v>
<v Speaker 3>and contours of a male,</v>

2119
01:45:34.371 --> 01:45:39.371
<v Speaker 3>then they're probably not getting </v>
<v Speaker 3>adequate amount of estrogen or they're </v>

2120
01:45:39.371 --> 01:45:43.180
<v Speaker 3>supplementing with one form of another,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of either testosterone or deco or </v>

2121
01:45:43.320 --> 01:45:47.560
<v Speaker 3>nandrolone or a loan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2122
01:45:48.140 --> 01:45:53.140
<v Speaker 3>what androgen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a nfr some of the other dht like </v>

2123
01:45:53.140 --> 01:45:57.791
<v Speaker 3>products.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it'd be interesting to find out what </v>

2124
01:45:57.791 --> 01:45:57.980
<v Speaker 3>the chemistry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the bIochemistry is the individual,</v>

2125
01:45:58.400 --> 01:46:02.270
<v Speaker 3>but you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>muscle muscle response,</v>

2126
01:46:02.271 --> 01:46:03.980
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>absorption,</v>

2127
01:46:04.460 --> 01:46:06.740
<v Speaker 3>hips,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tendons,</v>

2128
01:46:07.190 --> 01:46:09.770
<v Speaker 3>cartilage and joints,</v>
<v Speaker 3>resilience,</v>

2129
01:46:09.771 --> 01:46:12.560
<v Speaker 3>thickness of the bone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Men have more dense bones,</v>

2130
01:46:12.561 --> 01:46:15.500
<v Speaker 3>more dense jaws than women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2131
01:46:15.830 --> 01:46:17.270
<v Speaker 3>mIndset.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The aggression,</v>

2132
01:46:17.780 --> 01:46:19.700
<v Speaker 3>there's a totally different direction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Imprinting,</v>

2133
01:46:19.760 --> 01:46:23.620
<v Speaker 3>imprinting right from that 30 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Men are different for a lot of ways.</v>

2134
01:46:23.621 --> 01:46:24.860
<v Speaker 3>The way we analyze things,</v>

2135
01:46:24.890 --> 01:46:27.990
<v Speaker 6>so we're not fair,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but when it comes to bone density,</v>

2136
01:46:28.250 --> 01:46:31.230
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>african american women have similar bone</v>

2137
01:46:31.231 --> 01:46:32.370
<v Speaker 6>density to white men.</v>

2138
01:46:32.420 --> 01:46:34.220
<v Speaker 3>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For whatever reason,</v>

2139
01:46:35.060 --> 01:46:40.060
<v Speaker 3>my significant other is a dentist and </v>
<v Speaker 3>would share with me over the past 30 </v>

2140
01:46:40.060 --> 01:46:44.741
<v Speaker 3>some odd years about the difference </v>
<v Speaker 3>between different racial groups and the </v>

2141
01:46:45.471 --> 01:46:47.690
<v Speaker 3>african american have much thicker </v>
<v Speaker 3>bones,</v>

2142
01:46:47.780 --> 01:46:51.840
<v Speaker 3>much thicker bones comparable to a male </v>
<v Speaker 3>or female to male,</v>

2143
01:46:51.870 --> 01:46:52.230
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>

2144
01:46:52.820 --> 01:46:57.820
<v Speaker 6>And astrogen.</v>
<v Speaker 6>In taking estrogen post transition </v>

2145
01:46:58.970 --> 01:47:03.970
<v Speaker 6>transition,</v>
<v Speaker 6>estrogen allows the bone density to </v>

2146
01:47:03.970 --> 01:47:07.661
<v Speaker 6>remain because estrogen,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is one of the issues in </v>

2147
01:47:07.661 --> 01:47:08.210
<v Speaker 6>osteoporosis,</v>
<v Speaker 6>is when women go through menopause,</v>

2148
01:47:08.211 --> 01:47:11.060
<v Speaker 6>their body stops producing estrogen,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so their bones lack density.</v>

2149
01:47:11.270 --> 01:47:15.470
<v Speaker 6>So in giving a transgender male </v>
<v Speaker 6>estrogen,</v>

2150
01:47:15.471 --> 01:47:18.630
<v Speaker 6>it actually preserves bone density,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so keeps them with a male.</v>

2151
01:47:18.880 --> 01:47:23.880
<v Speaker 3>That's correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't lose it as long as they're </v>

2152
01:47:23.880 --> 01:47:26.010
<v Speaker 3>making sure that not only vitamin d but </v>
<v Speaker 3>extra dial testosterone growth hormone </v>

2153
01:47:26.230 --> 01:47:28.780
<v Speaker 3>all help with bone density.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

2154
01:47:28.781 --> 01:47:33.781
<v Speaker 3>a growth hormone works about point one </v>
<v Speaker 3>point six percent increase in bone </v>

2155
01:47:33.781 --> 01:47:37.180
<v Speaker 3>density in a year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it raises the bone density.</v>

2156
01:47:37.181 --> 01:47:40.210
<v Speaker 3>We have patients who are growth hormone </v>
<v Speaker 3>deficient with thinning of the bones.</v>

2157
01:47:40.211 --> 01:47:42.610
<v Speaker 3>We put them back on physiologic dosing </v>
<v Speaker 3>of growth on,</v>

2158
01:47:42.850 --> 01:47:47.850
<v Speaker 3>you see in six months to a year that </v>
<v Speaker 3>bone density responds where in using </v>

2159
01:47:47.850 --> 01:47:49.210
<v Speaker 3>some of the medication that are out </v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

2160
01:47:49.211 --> 01:47:50.660
<v Speaker 3>which I won't name,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2161
01:47:50.680 --> 01:47:52.510
<v Speaker 3>can take,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm 23 years,</v>

2162
01:47:52.780 --> 01:47:56.740
<v Speaker 6>and bone density is also altered by </v>
<v Speaker 6>weightlifting,</v>

2163
01:47:56.800 --> 01:47:57.100
<v Speaker 6>correct?</v>

2164
01:47:57.230 --> 01:47:59.870
<v Speaker 3>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The body responds through pulling.</v>

2165
01:48:00.020 --> 01:48:01.790
<v Speaker 3>I mean people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The most common,</v>

2166
01:48:01.910 --> 01:48:03.010
<v Speaker 3>abnormal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2167
01:48:03.080 --> 01:48:08.080
<v Speaker 3>example of that are either achilles </v>
<v Speaker 3>tendon spurs or plantar fasciitis spurs </v>

2168
01:48:09.530 --> 01:48:14.530
<v Speaker 3>from pulling a muscle or tendon on bone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It stimulates more bone to be made.</v>

2169
01:48:15.050 --> 01:48:17.660
<v Speaker 3>So if you're stressing the bones is </v>
<v Speaker 3>really what it is,</v>

2170
01:48:17.840 --> 01:48:22.840
<v Speaker 3>you increase the density.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you look at people who are </v>

2171
01:48:22.840 --> 01:48:22.840
<v Speaker 3>sedentary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>drink alcohol,</v>

2172
01:48:22.840 --> 01:48:23.750
<v Speaker 3>blonde,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blue eyed,</v>

2173
01:48:23.780 --> 01:48:26.450
<v Speaker 3>male or female,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll see scandinavian study.</v>

2174
01:48:26.750 --> 01:48:31.280
<v Speaker 3>You'll see that their bone density is </v>
<v Speaker 3>less than people who are dark skinned,</v>

2175
01:48:31.700 --> 01:48:33.650
<v Speaker 3>dark haired,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and physically active.</v>

2176
01:48:33.860 --> 01:48:37.560
<v Speaker 3>These are things that helped maintain </v>
<v Speaker 3>and promote denser bone.</v>

2177
01:48:37.890 --> 01:48:41.100
<v Speaker 6>What happens to tendon strength and </v>
<v Speaker 6>things along those lines,</v>

2178
01:48:41.130 --> 01:48:44.530
<v Speaker 6>because tendons play a vital role in </v>
<v Speaker 6>striking in,</v>

2179
01:48:44.531 --> 01:48:45.590
<v Speaker 6>in combat sports.</v>

2180
01:48:45.600 --> 01:48:46.580
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2181
01:48:46.740 --> 01:48:50.550
<v Speaker 3>specifically about tendons I can't </v>
<v Speaker 3>answer other than the muscle.</v>

2182
01:48:50.720 --> 01:48:54.120
<v Speaker 3>IT improves the muscle in muscles are </v>
<v Speaker 3>connected to tendons.</v>

2183
01:48:54.180 --> 01:48:59.180
<v Speaker 3>Tendons are a inert kind of tissue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the muscle that pull on the tendon.</v>

2184
01:48:59.521 --> 01:49:04.521
<v Speaker 3>So it's the muscle issue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the muscles decreased with estrogen </v>

2185
01:49:04.521 --> 01:49:07.851
<v Speaker 3>therapy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can do decrease with estrogen </v>

2186
01:49:07.851 --> 01:49:10.611
<v Speaker 3>therapy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if they're also on something that </v>

2187
01:49:10.611 --> 01:49:12.180
<v Speaker 3>puts back testosterone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can generate a balance.</v>

2188
01:49:12.181 --> 01:49:14.820
<v Speaker 3>So they get some softening,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they don't lose the muscle.</v>

2189
01:49:15.450 --> 01:49:20.450
<v Speaker 3>And then estrogen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd have to look at the biochemistry </v>

2190
01:49:20.450 --> 01:49:24.111
<v Speaker 3>of it to really answer it because if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're being strict on the process of </v>

2191
01:49:24.780 --> 01:49:29.780
<v Speaker 3>total transgender transformation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you need to give them lots of estrogen </v>

2192
01:49:29.780 --> 01:49:31.830
<v Speaker 3>in diminished the testosterone which </v>
<v Speaker 3>competes with the estrogen.</v>

2193
01:49:31.980 --> 01:49:36.980
<v Speaker 3>So if you want to be a dominant estrogen</v>
<v Speaker 3>dominant to be a female estrogen </v>

2194
01:49:36.980 --> 01:49:40.371
<v Speaker 3>dominant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you have to wipe out the </v>

2195
01:49:40.371 --> 01:49:40.371
<v Speaker 3>testosterone.</v>

2196
01:49:40.371 --> 01:49:43.810
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this has been such a highly charged and </v>

2197
01:49:43.810 --> 01:49:45.981
<v Speaker 6>emotional discussion and it becomes a </v>
<v Speaker 6>transphobic or an anti transgender more </v>

2198
01:49:48.371 --> 01:49:53.371
<v Speaker 6>than it becomes an argument of fairness </v>
<v Speaker 6>involving a sport where the very goal is</v>

2199
01:49:54.521 --> 01:49:59.521
<v Speaker 6>to use your body to hurt somebody else </v>
<v Speaker 6>and if you have some sort of just </v>

2200
01:49:59.521 --> 01:50:04.320
<v Speaker 6>natural physiological advantages over </v>
<v Speaker 6>that person because you were born male,</v>

2201
01:50:04.961 --> 01:50:09.961
<v Speaker 6>not because you're.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I meAn this is a spectrum involving </v>

2202
01:50:09.961 --> 01:50:12.931
<v Speaker 6>women.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's some women that are very </v>

2203
01:50:12.931 --> 01:50:12.931
<v Speaker 6>feminine,</v>
<v Speaker 6>very petite,</v>

2204
01:50:12.931 --> 01:50:15.651
<v Speaker 6>and there's some women that are very </v>
<v Speaker 6>thIck and very physically strong just </v>

2205
01:50:15.651 --> 01:50:15.760
<v Speaker 6>naturally,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but from the womb,</v>

2206
01:50:15.930 --> 01:50:17.410
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no added hormones,</v>

2207
01:50:17.411 --> 01:50:18.780
<v Speaker 6>no added anything.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So.</v>

2208
01:50:18.810 --> 01:50:22.180
<v Speaker 6>but the idea is that that's mitigated by</v>
<v Speaker 6>weight classes.</v>

2209
01:50:22.510 --> 01:50:25.890
<v Speaker 6>The idea is that a 135 pound woman in </v>
<v Speaker 6>135 pound woman,</v>

2210
01:50:25.930 --> 01:50:27.820
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're both 135 pounds.</v>

2211
01:50:28.130 --> 01:50:30.040
<v Speaker 6>They're pre,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whether they're,</v>

2212
01:50:30.290 --> 01:50:31.570
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's variations,</v>

2213
01:50:31.571 --> 01:50:33.330
<v Speaker 6>but pretty close,</v>
<v Speaker 6>let's,</v>

2214
01:50:33.340 --> 01:50:34.720
<v Speaker 6>let's have them compete against each </v>
<v Speaker 6>other.</v>

2215
01:50:34.810 --> 01:50:38.800
<v Speaker 6>But 135 pound man versus 135 pound </v>
<v Speaker 6>woman.</v>

2216
01:50:39.130 --> 01:50:44.130
<v Speaker 6>Very different.</v>
<v Speaker 6>One hundred and 35 pound transitioning </v>

2217
01:50:44.130 --> 01:50:47.881
<v Speaker 6>man to transgender woman.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Still different than a biologic,</v>

2218
01:50:48.400 --> 01:50:53.110
<v Speaker 3>a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would have undue disadvantage.</v>

2219
01:50:53.320 --> 01:50:56.560
<v Speaker 3>The competitor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>female natural born,</v>

2220
01:50:56.561 --> 01:51:01.561
<v Speaker 3>digital born female,</v>
<v Speaker 3>would have undue disadvantage against a </v>

2221
01:51:01.561 --> 01:51:04.681
<v Speaker 3>transgender female from male to female.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Genetically,</v>

2222
01:51:05.420 --> 01:51:10.420
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're always going to be a male </v>

2223
01:51:10.420 --> 01:51:10.420
<v Speaker 3>genetically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it means that the biochemistry,</v>

2224
01:51:10.420 --> 01:51:14.671
<v Speaker 3>when you put these things into it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the body wIll respond to preference </v>

2225
01:51:14.671 --> 01:51:17.440
<v Speaker 3>male,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unless you totally put in chemistry to,</v>

2226
01:51:17.500 --> 01:51:19.570
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to stop that.</v>

2227
01:51:19.600 --> 01:51:20.530
<v Speaker 3>And that's that cypress.</v>

2228
01:51:20.780 --> 01:51:24.160
<v Speaker 6>But let's assume that they even do put </v>
<v Speaker 6>the chemicals in to stop that.</v>

2229
01:51:24.161 --> 01:51:27.190
<v Speaker 6>Would they still have significant </v>
<v Speaker 6>advantages in any area?</v>

2230
01:51:27.300 --> 01:51:28.870
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For a timeframe they would.</v>

2231
01:51:28.871 --> 01:51:33.871
<v Speaker 3>Until the optimal effects that you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>looking for by giving estrogen for </v>

2232
01:51:34.361 --> 01:51:36.970
<v Speaker 3>softening the musculature,</v>
<v Speaker 3>take effect.</v>

2233
01:51:37.380 --> 01:51:38.220
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's still,</v>

2234
01:51:38.221 --> 01:51:42.510
<v Speaker 6>there's a 10 percent benefit that men </v>
<v Speaker 6>have over women,</v>

2235
01:51:42.511 --> 01:51:47.511
<v Speaker 6>like across the board and reaction time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Would that still be a factor if they had</v>

2236
01:51:48.090 --> 01:51:49.140
<v Speaker 6>transitioned to a woman?</v>

2237
01:51:49.600 --> 01:51:51.190
<v Speaker 3>I really don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That answer</v>

2238
01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:57.000
<v Speaker 6>is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There probably hasn't been that many </v>

2239
01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:57.000
<v Speaker 6>studies on this as well.</v>

2240
01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:59.690
<v Speaker 3>I think the biggest problem in this one </v>
<v Speaker 3>case that you're talking about is that </v>

2241
01:51:59.690 --> 01:52:01.920
<v Speaker 3>there's really no precedences,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no wealth of documentation where they've</v>

2242
01:52:01.921 --> 01:52:06.921
<v Speaker 3>actually looked at someone who goes from</v>
<v Speaker 3>male to female and gets into some male </v>

2243
01:52:07.141 --> 01:52:12.141
<v Speaker 3>sports within and not wrestling or </v>
<v Speaker 3>grappling or mma or whatever the </v>

2244
01:52:12.271 --> 01:52:14.100
<v Speaker 3>situation is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or baseball was there.</v>

2245
01:52:14.101 --> 01:52:18.510
<v Speaker 3>Someone recently went into transitional.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Went into a sport</v>

2246
01:52:19.280 --> 01:52:21.620
<v Speaker 6>that cyclist.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2247
01:52:21.621 --> 01:52:23.390
<v Speaker 6>Michelle,</v>
<v Speaker 6>do more ask.</v>

2248
01:52:23.780 --> 01:52:24.360
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This,</v>

2249
01:52:24.361 --> 01:52:27.260
<v Speaker 6>it's a fascinating story.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She transitioned.</v>

2250
01:52:27.290 --> 01:52:29.870
<v Speaker 6>She had sex reassignment surgery,</v>
<v Speaker 6>became a woman,</v>

2251
01:52:30.020 --> 01:52:35.020
<v Speaker 6>and started competIng in biking in,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and in her first she,</v>

2252
01:52:37.220 --> 01:52:42.220
<v Speaker 6>she entered a novice female class.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Her first finish was two point five </v>

2253
01:52:42.220 --> 01:52:45.080
<v Speaker 6>seconds faster than the winner of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>professional female category.</v>

2254
01:52:45.830 --> 01:52:50.190
<v Speaker 6>She went on to win the fall in 2002.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She,</v>

2255
01:52:50.191 --> 01:52:52.130
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>she was awarded a license to race in the</v>

2256
01:52:52.131 --> 01:52:53.450
<v Speaker 6>women's category.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Three weekS later,</v>

2257
01:52:53.570 --> 01:52:56.240
<v Speaker 6>she entered her first race in the pro </v>
<v Speaker 6>woman's class,</v>

2258
01:52:56.241 --> 01:53:01.241
<v Speaker 6>finished third the following week.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She plays first beating her compete </v>

2259
01:53:01.241 --> 01:53:03.050
<v Speaker 6>competition by 10 seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And this is,</v>

2260
01:53:03.070 --> 01:53:04.130
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a novice,</v>

2261
01:53:04.131 --> 01:53:09.131
<v Speaker 6>a person who's just just entering into </v>
<v Speaker 6>this world of professional racing and </v>

2262
01:53:09.131 --> 01:53:13.031
<v Speaker 6>she's just stomping these women a wave </v>
<v Speaker 6>of protests and sued and petition was </v>

2263
01:53:13.031 --> 01:53:16.811
<v Speaker 6>created and signed by female and a few </v>
<v Speaker 6>male racers asking her to be </v>

2264
01:53:16.811 --> 01:53:18.650
<v Speaker 6>dIsqualified because she had a race </v>
<v Speaker 6>licensed.</v>

2265
01:53:18.650 --> 01:53:21.710
<v Speaker 6>The request was denied.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So it became this huge controversy.</v>

2266
01:53:21.950 --> 01:53:23.610
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and you know,</v>

2267
01:53:23.630 --> 01:53:28.630
<v Speaker 6>this is another example of someone who </v>
<v Speaker 6>has an unfair physical advantage or is </v>

2268
01:53:28.630 --> 01:53:30.930
<v Speaker 6>thought to have that tech chemically.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

2269
01:53:31.320 --> 01:53:36.320
<v Speaker 6>there's another problem with this is </v>
<v Speaker 6>that there's a lot of confirmation bias </v>

2270
01:53:36.320 --> 01:53:37.880
<v Speaker 6>about this and there's a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 6>emotions.</v>

2271
01:53:37.910 --> 01:53:41.120
<v Speaker 6>They're riding on this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And this person who we're talking about,</v>

2272
01:53:41.121 --> 01:53:44.810
<v Speaker 6>the person in question has become </v>
<v Speaker 6>essentially a poster boy for transgender</v>

2273
01:53:44.811 --> 01:53:48.830
<v Speaker 6>rights and transgender acceptance.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I couldn't think of a worst possible</v>

2274
01:53:48.831 --> 01:53:51.290
<v Speaker 6>example.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's one thing to say,</v>

2275
01:53:51.740 --> 01:53:52.940
<v Speaker 6>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2276
01:53:53.420 --> 01:53:57.470
<v Speaker 6>this person wants their own personal </v>
<v Speaker 6>freedom to be living their life.</v>

2277
01:53:57.471 --> 01:53:59.480
<v Speaker 6>As a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do you accept that?</v>

2278
01:53:59.481 --> 01:54:00.920
<v Speaker 6>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Change your name,</v>

2279
01:54:00.921 --> 01:54:02.660
<v Speaker 6>change whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whatever you want,</v>

2280
01:54:03.110 --> 01:54:05.240
<v Speaker 6>but when you're asking for that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

2281
01:54:05.840 --> 01:54:10.840
<v Speaker 6>But you're entering into combat sports </v>
<v Speaker 6>with natural born females and literally </v>

2282
01:54:11.151 --> 01:54:12.920
<v Speaker 6>beating the shit out of them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Boy,</v>

2283
01:54:12.980 --> 01:54:16.040
<v Speaker 6>that gets really fucking tricky.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That gets really tricky.</v>

2284
01:54:16.760 --> 01:54:18.620
<v Speaker 3>So what do you think the resolve will </v>
<v Speaker 3>be?</v>

2285
01:54:18.621 --> 01:54:22.340
<v Speaker 3>Have a separate organization that only </v>
<v Speaker 3>deals with transgender.</v>

2286
01:54:22.430 --> 01:54:23.710
<v Speaker 3>That's the best way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2287
01:54:23.720 --> 01:54:25.430
<v Speaker 3>that's probably the best way to </v>
<v Speaker 3>professional.</v>

2288
01:54:25.640 --> 01:54:30.640
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if there's a point at which the </v>

2289
01:54:30.640 --> 01:54:32.750
<v Speaker 3>body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the body provides homeostasis as a woman</v>

2290
01:54:32.870 --> 01:54:35.330
<v Speaker 3>after doing all that testing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isn't,</v>

2291
01:54:35.390 --> 01:54:38.060
<v Speaker 3>isn't that measurable?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's measurable,</v>

2292
01:54:38.090 --> 01:54:43.090
<v Speaker 3>but It's going to take a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They might be in their seventies by the </v>

2293
01:54:43.090 --> 01:54:43.130
<v Speaker 3>time it takes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it takes.</v>

2294
01:54:43.160 --> 01:54:48.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the point is they're genetically </v>

2295
01:54:48.160 --> 01:54:48.160
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whatever you throw into their body,</v>

2296
01:54:48.160 --> 01:54:51.830
<v Speaker 3>their body's going to respond to it as </v>
<v Speaker 3>their original gender.</v>

2297
01:54:52.520 --> 01:54:55.310
<v Speaker 3>so the testosterone that you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>

2298
01:54:55.380 --> 01:55:00.380
<v Speaker 3>the problem that people have that I've </v>
<v Speaker 3>talked to is if I start taking this </v>

2299
01:55:00.561 --> 01:55:02.060
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to have to take it the rest of</v>

2300
01:55:02.061 --> 01:55:05.780
<v Speaker 3>my life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're deficient,</v>

2301
01:55:05.781 --> 01:55:09.470
<v Speaker 3>I used to get this for the past 14 </v>
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

2302
01:55:09.950 --> 01:55:12.590
<v Speaker 3>You're a diabetic who needs insulin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2303
01:55:12.800 --> 01:55:14.600
<v Speaker 3>What are you going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rest of your life.</v>

2304
01:55:14.630 --> 01:55:16.420
<v Speaker 3>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Same thing with testosterone.</v>

2305
01:55:16.460 --> 01:55:18.710
<v Speaker 3>Thyroid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm committed to my thyroid for the rest</v>

2306
01:55:18.711 --> 01:55:22.550
<v Speaker 3>of my life because without it I gained </v>
<v Speaker 3>weight.</v>

2307
01:55:23.450 --> 01:55:27.560
<v Speaker 3>My thought processes are slowed down and</v>
<v Speaker 3>now I race all the time.</v>

2308
01:55:28.380 --> 01:55:32.480
<v Speaker 3>Brain wise it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you have to treat it like a,</v>

2309
01:55:32.690 --> 01:55:34.520
<v Speaker 3>like a disorder,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a disease.</v>

2310
01:55:34.521 --> 01:55:36.240
<v Speaker 3>It's a deficiency syndrome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Efficiency.</v>

2311
01:55:36.241 --> 01:55:36.740
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To do,</v>

2312
01:55:36.770 --> 01:55:38.360
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand why,</v>

2313
01:55:38.390 --> 01:55:40.760
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my colleagues tend to isolate it just as</v>

2314
01:55:40.761 --> 01:55:41.960
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2315
01:55:42.110 --> 01:55:44.610
<v Speaker 3>positioned it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're deficient,</v>

2316
01:55:44.611 --> 01:55:46.770
<v Speaker 3>you replace your replace or replenish </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

2317
01:55:46.771 --> 01:55:48.180
<v Speaker 3>bringing it back to where the normal </v>
<v Speaker 3>love.</v>

2318
01:55:48.181 --> 01:55:53.181
<v Speaker 3>Liz,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the other thing is we have developed a </v>

2319
01:55:53.181 --> 01:55:56.100
<v Speaker 3>statistical models for at 20 years of </v>
<v Speaker 3>age,</v>

2320
01:55:56.130 --> 01:56:01.130
<v Speaker 3>you need this amount of hormone at 40 </v>
<v Speaker 3>this mount which is less and at 60 this </v>

2321
01:56:01.130 --> 01:56:05.271
<v Speaker 3>amount,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do we replace everything to one </v>

2322
01:56:05.271 --> 01:56:07.611
<v Speaker 3>word,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the healthiest between 25 and 35 and </v>

2323
01:56:07.611 --> 01:56:08.040
<v Speaker 3>that's the premise of our practice and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's why we get the responses we do.</v>

2324
01:56:08.400 --> 01:56:13.400
<v Speaker 3>We don't return a 70 year old to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>average 70 year old level because they </v>

2325
01:56:13.400 --> 01:56:17.241
<v Speaker 3>weren't getting any benefit in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we bring them to a level that has </v>

2326
01:56:17.241 --> 01:56:17.241
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the peak of it.</v>

2327
01:56:17.241 --> 01:56:18.920
<v Speaker 2>Do you have a seven year old wives </v>
<v Speaker 2>coming in and go,</v>

2328
01:56:18.950 --> 01:56:22.180
<v Speaker 2>let's do one stop fucking man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We fucking dose back.</v>

2329
01:56:22.310 --> 01:56:23.110
<v Speaker 2>Jesus christ.</v>

2330
01:56:23.320 --> 01:56:25.120
<v Speaker 3>I had a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You brought it up,</v>

2331
01:56:25.900 --> 01:56:29.020
<v Speaker 3>you brought it up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ninety four year old guy comes in with a</v>

2332
01:56:29.021 --> 01:56:34.021
<v Speaker 3>walker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rice 94 year old guy comes in on a </v>

2333
01:56:34.021 --> 01:56:36.730
<v Speaker 3>walker,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was brought in by one guy that I talked </v>

2334
01:56:36.730 --> 01:56:37.210
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>keith and he'd been using the walker for</v>

2335
01:56:37.211 --> 01:56:39.040
<v Speaker 3>about 17 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Comes in,</v>

2336
01:56:40.090 --> 01:56:45.090
<v Speaker 3>come in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we put them on two hormones now in </v>

2337
01:56:45.090 --> 01:56:48.670
<v Speaker 3>the past I would draw the blood,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get results and then starting.</v>

2338
01:56:48.671 --> 01:56:51.340
<v Speaker 3>But he had a classical syndrome called </v>
<v Speaker 3>the frailty syndrome.</v>

2339
01:56:51.370 --> 01:56:56.370
<v Speaker 3>He was holding onto the walker and </v>
<v Speaker 3>shaking because he didn't have muscle </v>

2340
01:56:56.370 --> 01:56:57.760
<v Speaker 3>tone to support his own body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is classical,</v>

2341
01:56:58.070 --> 01:57:00.310
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fatigue syndrome.</v>

2342
01:57:00.940 --> 01:57:04.450
<v Speaker 3>So I put them onto a middle of the road </v>
<v Speaker 3>treatment protocol,</v>

2343
01:57:04.570 --> 01:57:07.450
<v Speaker 3>low dose regiment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and waited for the labs,</v>

2344
01:57:07.451 --> 01:57:09.040
<v Speaker 3>come back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>told him to come back in six weeks,</v>

2345
01:57:09.050 --> 01:57:10.990
<v Speaker 3>came back in six weeks and we started </v>
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>

2346
01:57:11.220 --> 01:57:16.220
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>reviewed the labs and he was on </v>

2347
01:57:16.220 --> 01:57:16.220
<v Speaker 3>appropriate mount and drew blood again </v>
<v Speaker 3>to monitor him.</v>

2348
01:57:16.510 --> 01:57:19.480
<v Speaker 3>And we chit chatted a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And as he started leaving the room,</v>

2349
01:57:19.481 --> 01:57:20.860
<v Speaker 3>he turns to me and says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2350
01:57:20.890 --> 01:57:22.120
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dr.</v>

2351
01:57:22.120 --> 01:57:23.590
<v Speaker 3>Gordon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I probably should tell you,</v>

2352
01:57:23.591 --> 01:57:25.930
<v Speaker 3>I finally had sex with my 60 year old </v>
<v Speaker 3>girlfriend.</v>

2353
01:57:26.370 --> 01:57:29.830
<v Speaker 3>And that tells you that at replacing the</v>
<v Speaker 3>hormone,</v>

2354
01:57:29.890 --> 01:57:34.890
<v Speaker 3>that psychologically you have to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychologically attuned to want to have </v>

2355
01:57:34.890 --> 01:57:38.341
<v Speaker 3>sex.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't just have sex because the </v>

2356
01:57:38.341 --> 01:57:38.341
<v Speaker 3>brain is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2357
01:57:38.341 --> 01:57:40.960
<v Speaker 3>not with you physiologically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything that has to be working in </v>

2358
01:57:40.960 --> 01:57:40.960
<v Speaker 3>physically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to have the moves.</v>

2359
01:57:44.440 --> 01:57:45.470
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what he did to me.</v>

2360
01:57:45.471 --> 01:57:47.350
<v Speaker 2>He's got some.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other thing is he</v>

2361
01:57:47.610 --> 01:57:50.330
<v Speaker 3>carried his walker in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He knew it,</v>

2362
01:57:50.390 --> 01:57:53.430
<v Speaker 3>didn't walk on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He carried it in under his arm.</v>

2363
01:57:53.431 --> 01:57:55.200
<v Speaker 3>And I said to herman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said to herman,</v>

2364
01:57:55.201 --> 01:57:57.300
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why are you carrying the walk?</v>

2365
01:57:57.310 --> 01:57:57.960
<v Speaker 3>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2366
01:57:57.961 --> 01:58:01.170
<v Speaker 3>I've used it for 17 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've had to continue using it.</v>

2367
01:58:01.200 --> 01:58:02.310
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did you use it today?</v>

2368
01:58:02.311 --> 01:58:02.940
<v Speaker 3>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2369
01:58:03.190 --> 01:58:04.320
<v Speaker 3>so we'll leave it home.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He says,</v>

2370
01:58:04.321 --> 01:58:05.550
<v Speaker 3>but I'm afraid I might fall.</v>

2371
01:58:06.230 --> 01:58:07.640
<v Speaker 2>He's committed to his walker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2372
01:58:07.641 --> 01:58:09.710
<v Speaker 2>you're committed to your thyroid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

2373
01:58:10.190 --> 01:58:10.820
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2374
01:58:10.850 --> 01:58:14.300
<v Speaker 2>I think it's different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like if he needed,</v>

2375
01:58:14.710 --> 01:58:16.970
<v Speaker 2>he didn't need the thyroid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's still taking it with them.</v>

2376
01:58:17.890 --> 01:58:20.990
<v Speaker 2>How about levitra or stylists or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that?</v>

2377
01:58:21.230 --> 01:58:26.230
<v Speaker 2>It does help your testosterone does </v>
<v Speaker 2>allegedly allegedly know anything about </v>

2378
01:58:26.920 --> 01:58:28.250
<v Speaker 2>it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the answer is yes.</v>

2379
01:58:28.251 --> 01:58:30.480
<v Speaker 2>You've had some 90 year old dudes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking the shit out there.</v>

2380
01:58:30.780 --> 01:58:32.750
<v Speaker 2>I shouldn't say it like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2381
01:58:32.751 --> 01:58:34.630
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2382
01:58:35.630 --> 01:58:36.290
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

2383
01:58:36.350 --> 01:58:39.560
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you ever had negative responses,</v>

2384
01:58:39.630 --> 01:58:44.630
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've put them on some of a hormone </v>

2385
01:58:44.630 --> 01:58:44.630
<v Speaker 2>replacement protocol and that becomes </v>
<v Speaker 2>issues.</v>

2386
01:58:44.630 --> 01:58:44.630
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are those?</v>

2387
01:58:44.790 --> 01:58:45.840
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's see,</v>

2388
01:58:46.610 --> 01:58:51.610
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a gentleman who was put onto 60 </v>

2389
01:58:51.610 --> 01:58:54.981
<v Speaker 3>milligrams a week of testosterone and </v>
<v Speaker 3>all they wanted to do is have sex with </v>

2390
01:58:54.981 --> 01:58:55.230
<v Speaker 3>anything that walked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2391
01:58:55.250 --> 01:58:57.480
<v Speaker 3>so we had a lower them down to 40 </v>
<v Speaker 3>milligrams,</v>

2392
01:58:59.340 --> 01:59:04.340
<v Speaker 3>three patients who had a panic attack </v>
<v Speaker 3>because this process of testosterone in </v>

2393
01:59:04.621 --> 01:59:07.290
<v Speaker 3>the brain going to this thing called </v>
<v Speaker 3>adenyl cyclase.</v>

2394
01:59:07.320 --> 01:59:10.260
<v Speaker 3>If it's the wrong person or too much </v>
<v Speaker 3>relative to their body,</v>

2395
01:59:10.560 --> 01:59:13.200
<v Speaker 3>they can get a panic attack,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I've had in three patients.</v>

2396
01:59:13.201 --> 01:59:14.690
<v Speaker 3>You load those in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>disappears.</v>

2397
01:59:14.700 --> 01:59:16.530
<v Speaker 3>What is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's causing the panic attack?</v>

2398
01:59:16.560 --> 01:59:21.540
<v Speaker 3>It's a chemical called adenyl cyclase,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is like a stimulate in the brain,</v>

2399
01:59:21.720 --> 01:59:24.330
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just pushes you over the edge.</v>

2400
01:59:24.430 --> 01:59:28.660
<v Speaker 2>So is it that they have so much </v>
<v Speaker 2>testosterone and then their body thinks,</v>

2401
01:59:28.661 --> 01:59:29.350
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we must have,</v>

2402
01:59:29.680 --> 01:59:31.960
<v Speaker 2>we must be in a dangerous area.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that why we have.</v>

2403
01:59:31.970 --> 01:59:32.040
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

2404
01:59:32.170 --> 01:59:35.090
<v Speaker 3>it's relative.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hormones are relative.</v>

2405
01:59:35.240 --> 01:59:40.240
<v Speaker 3>It's not absolute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't say 100 is what everybody </v>

2406
01:59:40.240 --> 01:59:43.121
<v Speaker 3>uses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know there are people who need 20 </v>

2407
01:59:43.121 --> 01:59:46.991
<v Speaker 3>milligrams.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have one gal that the average </v>

2408
01:59:46.991 --> 01:59:46.991
<v Speaker 3>production of a woman in a week is about</v>
<v Speaker 3>20 milligrams.</v>

2409
01:59:46.991 --> 01:59:51.940
<v Speaker 3>She would use 20 milligrams a month and </v>
<v Speaker 3>she meet her it by her libido.</v>

2410
01:59:53.150 --> 01:59:58.150
<v Speaker 3>so average weekly dose she used every </v>
<v Speaker 3>month because she was super sensItive to</v>

2411
01:59:58.341 --> 01:59:59.660
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Women,</v>

2412
01:59:59.661 --> 02:00:01.670
<v Speaker 3>when they get on testosterone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get super horny,</v>

2413
02:00:02.210 --> 02:00:05.330
<v Speaker 3>they get assertive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is great.</v>

2414
02:00:05.540 --> 02:00:08.840
<v Speaker 3>They get allegedly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was mostly living with them.</v>

2415
02:00:09.970 --> 02:00:13.650
<v Speaker 3>The confidence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>assertiveness a,</v>

2416
02:00:13.660 --> 02:00:16.910
<v Speaker 3>they start feeling great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They absolutely feel better,</v>

2417
02:00:16.970 --> 02:00:21.970
<v Speaker 3>a competitive and it's all degrees of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all acceptable degrees of and when </v>

2418
02:00:22.491 --> 02:00:27.491
<v Speaker 3>you overtreat them then you get into,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to be fucked now in our and in </v>

2419
02:00:27.491 --> 02:00:30.050
<v Speaker 3>two hours and three hours in four hours </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

2420
02:00:30.051 --> 02:00:31.820
<v Speaker 3>you're using science from personal </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience.</v>

2421
02:00:32.360 --> 02:00:37.360
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely not just a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had to go back and take human </v>

2422
02:00:37.401 --> 02:00:42.401
<v Speaker 3>sexuality classes so that I can feel </v>
<v Speaker 3>comfortable saying the f word on your </v>

2423
02:00:42.401 --> 02:00:42.401
<v Speaker 3>show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really.</v>

2424
02:00:42.401 --> 02:00:44.660
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely you to take.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I took it years ago.</v>

2425
02:00:45.050 --> 02:00:50.050
<v Speaker 3>It helped me with dealing with my own </v>
<v Speaker 3>upbringing and my conservative </v>

2426
02:00:50.050 --> 02:00:54.780
<v Speaker 3>conservative.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you grew up in a time with no </v>

2427
02:00:54.780 --> 02:00:54.780
<v Speaker 3>internet man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the world's changed.</v>

2428
02:00:54.780 --> 02:00:54.780
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>working it out.</v>

2429
02:00:54.870 --> 02:00:56.630
<v Speaker 3>Doctors dot dropping,</v>
<v Speaker 3>f bombs left and right.</v>

2430
02:00:56.631 --> 02:01:01.631
<v Speaker 3>And these days,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh you got a fucking broken leg kit and </v>

2431
02:01:01.631 --> 02:01:02.510
<v Speaker 3>being from New York,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2432
02:01:02.810 --> 02:01:07.810
<v Speaker 3>fuck is the what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And his first and idea is second and </v>

2433
02:01:07.810 --> 02:01:09.180
<v Speaker 3>fuck his third.</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2434
02:01:09.230 --> 02:01:10.850
<v Speaker 3>it's a common one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a common one,</v>

2435
02:01:11.660 --> 02:01:13.820
<v Speaker 3>but there are better words in some of </v>
<v Speaker 3>us.</v>

2436
02:01:13.821 --> 02:01:14.630
<v Speaker 3>there are better words.</v>

2437
02:01:15.220 --> 02:01:20.220
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this people have this response to the </v>

2438
02:01:20.220 --> 02:01:22.390
<v Speaker 2>testosterone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They developed this anxiety issue,</v>

2439
02:01:22.450 --> 02:01:24.030
<v Speaker 2>panic attack,</v>
<v Speaker 2>panic attack,</v>

2440
02:01:24.040 --> 02:01:26.980
<v Speaker 2>but what exactly is a panic attack like </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's going on when you,</v>

2441
02:01:27.430 --> 02:01:32.430
<v Speaker 3>it's an explosive fear of the unknown </v>
<v Speaker 3>where they think something bad's going </v>

2442
02:01:32.430 --> 02:01:36.151
<v Speaker 3>to happen to them and they get </v>
<v Speaker 3>hyperventilation and they get a fast </v>

2443
02:01:37.571 --> 02:01:42.571
<v Speaker 3>pulse and from the hyperventilation they</v>
<v Speaker 3>can actually pass out because they </v>

2444
02:01:42.571 --> 02:01:46.070
<v Speaker 3>changed the ph of the blood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We had a guy in the ufc that was in the,</v>

2445
02:01:46.071 --> 02:01:48.410
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the locker room about the fight,</v>

2446
02:01:48.650 --> 02:01:53.650
<v Speaker 3>had a panic attack and was </v>
<v Speaker 3>hyperventilating and they actually </v>

2447
02:01:53.650 --> 02:01:56.351
<v Speaker 3>pulled them from the fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>haven't breathed it into a brown paper </v>

2448
02:01:56.351 --> 02:01:56.900
<v Speaker 3>bag or a plastic bag or put one of those</v>
<v Speaker 3>black hoods over their head.</v>

2449
02:01:56.930 --> 02:01:57.710
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what does that do?</v>

2450
02:01:58.130 --> 02:02:00.500
<v Speaker 3>What the lag.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What it is is,</v>

2451
02:02:00.570 --> 02:02:01.910
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you hyperventilate,</v>

2452
02:02:01.911 --> 02:02:06.911
<v Speaker 3>you're blowing in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're getting in too much oxygen and </v>

2453
02:02:06.911 --> 02:02:07.880
<v Speaker 3>getting rid of your calcium and it falls</v>
<v Speaker 3>out of solutions in calcium's,</v>

2454
02:02:07.881 --> 02:02:12.881
<v Speaker 3>responsible for a neuro conductivity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when you breathe in too much or </v>

2455
02:02:12.881 --> 02:02:17.051
<v Speaker 3>giving you a hyper ventilate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you create a change in the acid balance,</v>

2456
02:02:17.541 --> 02:02:20.570
<v Speaker 3>acid base and calcium is used to try and</v>
<v Speaker 3>stabilize it.</v>

2457
02:02:20.900 --> 02:02:22.880
<v Speaker 3>So what happens is it falls out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>solution.</v>

2458
02:02:23.600 --> 02:02:25.880
<v Speaker 3>Calcium hydroxide.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does the black bag do?</v>

2459
02:02:26.260 --> 02:02:28.130
<v Speaker 3>A,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was just being funny.</v>

2460
02:02:28.910 --> 02:02:32.420
<v Speaker 3>Brown paper bag.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like plastic over brown paper.</v>

2461
02:02:32.930 --> 02:02:34.790
<v Speaker 3>Brown paper makes too much crunching.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Noise,</v>

2462
02:02:34.820 --> 02:02:39.820
<v Speaker 3>cocaine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the idea of a bag being that you're </v>

2463
02:02:39.820 --> 02:02:42.011
<v Speaker 3>not getting all the oxygen from around </v>
<v Speaker 3>where you're breathing in carbon </v>

2464
02:02:42.011 --> 02:02:43.820
<v Speaker 3>dioxide,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you need to bring back your blowing from</v>

2465
02:02:43.821 --> 02:02:48.821
<v Speaker 3>hyperventilation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You blow out a lot of carbon dioxide </v>

2466
02:02:48.821 --> 02:02:49.130
<v Speaker 3>which your body actually needs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2467
02:02:49.131 --> 02:02:52.580
<v Speaker 3>if you give someone pure oxygen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can stop their breathing because the</v>

2468
02:02:52.581 --> 02:02:55.520
<v Speaker 3>balance of breathing is between oxygen </v>
<v Speaker 3>and carbon dioxide.</v>

2469
02:02:55.910 --> 02:02:58.490
<v Speaker 3>The carbon dioxide is actually what </v>
<v Speaker 3>stimulates you to breathe.</v>

2470
02:02:58.910 --> 02:03:01.740
<v Speaker 3>What about those like oxygen bars,</v>
<v Speaker 3>places?</v>

2471
02:03:02.650 --> 02:03:06.520
<v Speaker 3>What's the actor's name who has such </v>
<v Speaker 3>with age?</v>

2472
02:03:06.870 --> 02:03:09.530
<v Speaker 3>A woody harrelson I think has a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the action bars.</v>

2473
02:03:09.890 --> 02:03:10.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're great.</v>

2474
02:03:10.750 --> 02:03:11.450
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2475
02:03:11.750 --> 02:03:15.860
<v Speaker 3>Michael Jackson used to sleep in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>hyperbaric chamber.</v>

2476
02:03:15.890 --> 02:03:20.890
<v Speaker 3>He did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that has higher oxygen </v>

2477
02:03:20.890 --> 02:03:20.890
<v Speaker 3>concentration,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so getting more oxygen,</v>

2478
02:03:20.890 --> 02:03:21.890
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in las vegas,</v>

2479
02:03:21.891 --> 02:03:24.170
<v Speaker 3>you go to the airport,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was just there and they have all these</v>

2480
02:03:24.171 --> 02:03:29.171
<v Speaker 3>oxygen bars there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So after you had been bombed out for </v>

2481
02:03:29.171 --> 02:03:32.050
<v Speaker 3>three days,</v>
<v Speaker 3>playing every night until two in the </v>

2482
02:03:32.050 --> 02:03:32.050
<v Speaker 3>morning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're never getting to bed.</v>

2483
02:03:32.050 --> 02:03:32.550
<v Speaker 3>Oxygen can help you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2484
02:03:32.690 --> 02:03:36.380
<v Speaker 3>with some improvement in improving your </v>
<v Speaker 3>focus.</v>

2485
02:03:36.470 --> 02:03:38.840
<v Speaker 3>But don't they pump it into the casinos </v>
<v Speaker 3>as well?</v>

2486
02:03:38.841 --> 02:03:40.550
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The supposedly is what they said.</v>

2487
02:03:40.551 --> 02:03:43.250
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the true keeps you up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I've heard too,</v>

2488
02:03:43.490 --> 02:03:45.830
<v Speaker 3>but I don't know if that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We need to find.</v>

2489
02:03:45.890 --> 02:03:50.890
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if they would ever fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>admit that you bring an oxygen meter in </v>

2490
02:03:50.890 --> 02:03:53.660
<v Speaker 3>and if it's a 21 percent or higher,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know they are because it's,</v>

2491
02:03:53.661 --> 02:03:56.720
<v Speaker 3>I think 19 percent in the natural world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The fucking tackle.</v>

2492
02:03:56.721 --> 02:04:01.721
<v Speaker 3>You want them to oxygen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why they have all those cards </v>

2493
02:04:01.721 --> 02:04:05.980
<v Speaker 3>tackle them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why they have the cameras up </v>

2494
02:04:05.980 --> 02:04:08.021
<v Speaker 3>there to make sure you don't bring </v>
<v Speaker 3>oxygen meters and the frisky for oxygen </v>

2495
02:04:08.021 --> 02:04:10.901
<v Speaker 3>meter walk through the door.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the idea that the oxygen keeps you </v>

2496
02:04:10.901 --> 02:04:10.901
<v Speaker 3>awake,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that what it is?</v>

2497
02:04:10.901 --> 02:04:13.190
<v Speaker 3>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>WhaT he says is false.</v>

2498
02:04:13.280 --> 02:04:15.490
<v Speaker 3>Snopes says it's false.</v>
<v Speaker 3>how the fuck do they know?</v>

2499
02:04:20.230 --> 02:04:22.850
<v Speaker 3>It's just the gambling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gambling is.</v>

2500
02:04:24.770 --> 02:04:29.770
<v Speaker 3>Could you ask him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it true that when you ask for a </v>

2501
02:04:29.770 --> 02:04:29.770
<v Speaker 3>drink,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're playing craps,</v>

2502
02:04:29.770 --> 02:04:32.150
<v Speaker 3>they put a lot of alcohol in it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it disinhibition so that you put more</v>

2503
02:04:32.151 --> 02:04:37.151
<v Speaker 3>money down then you have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well they definitely give you good free </v>

<v Speaker 3>drinks when you're gambling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was good.</v>

2505
02:04:38.280 --> 02:04:40.530
<v Speaker 2>That is a crazy fucking thing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're allowed to do.</v>

2506
02:04:40.560 --> 02:04:45.560
<v Speaker 2>Give you free drugs That lower your </v>
<v Speaker 2>inhibitions and cause you to make </v>

2507
02:04:45.560 --> 02:04:50.540
<v Speaker 2>irresponsible decisions while you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing something that involves gambling </v>

2508
02:04:50.540 --> 02:04:53.700
<v Speaker 2>and fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But so they got oxygen there.</v>

2509
02:04:53.790 --> 02:04:55.980
<v Speaker 2>I supported him 100 percent with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've done those.</v>

2510
02:04:55.981 --> 02:04:57.630
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those oxygen bars.</v>

2511
02:04:57.780 --> 02:05:02.780
<v Speaker 2>I did one in vegas once we sat down and </v>
<v Speaker 2>tried it and my friend eddie and I was </v>

2512
02:05:02.780 --> 02:05:02.780
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're feeling anything.</v>

<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you get to sit in their flavored?</v>

2514
02:05:06.240 --> 02:05:10.280
<v Speaker 2>Probably was going up my nose or sucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>on it.</v>

2515
02:05:10.700 --> 02:05:15.700
<v Speaker 2>I don't even remember.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I remember like given up after </v>

<v Speaker 2>awhile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

2517
02:05:15.700 --> 02:05:15.700

<v Speaker 2>this is not enough.</v>

2518
02:05:15.700 --> 02:05:17.100
<v Speaker 2>It's not like you have a shot and you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2519

<v Speaker 2>woo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this is working.</v>

2520
02:05:19.500 --> 02:05:21.510
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you awake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was the problem.</v>

2521
02:05:21.511 --> 02:05:22.620
<v Speaker 2>You had to be asleep to do it.</v>

2522
02:05:22.920 --> 02:05:27.920
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you're asleep and you have little </v>

2523
02:05:27.920 --> 02:05:27.920
<v Speaker 2>oxygenic does better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The guy at the float lab,</v>

2524
02:05:27.920 --> 02:05:31.830
<v Speaker 2>he pumps a oxygen into the isolation </v>
<v Speaker 2>tanks.</v>

2525
02:05:32.160 --> 02:05:34.020
<v Speaker 2>He uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has an oxygen scrubber,</v>

2526
02:05:34.080 --> 02:05:38.520
<v Speaker 2>like one of those ones that make those </v>
<v Speaker 2>weird noises and you know,</v>

2527
02:05:38.521 --> 02:05:39.690
<v Speaker 2>those auctions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>scrubber things,</v>

2528
02:05:39.890 --> 02:05:43.470
<v Speaker 2>it pumps air into the isolation tank to </v>
<v Speaker 2>enhance it.</v>

2529
02:05:43.520 --> 02:05:45.180
<v Speaker 2>Doing that tomorrow for the first time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where,</v>

<v Speaker 2>which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which place?</v>

2531
02:05:46.140 --> 02:05:47.550
<v Speaker 2>Venice float lab.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2532
02:05:47.820 --> 02:05:49.010
<v Speaker 2>it's awesome.</v>

2533
02:05:49.020 --> 02:05:51.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

2535
02:05:53.580 --> 02:05:55.320
<v Speaker 2>You mighT.</v>
<v Speaker 2>how long are you in the tank?</v>

2536
02:05:55.530 --> 02:06:00.530
<v Speaker 2>Depends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could do it for as little as an </v>

2537
02:06:00.530 --> 02:06:00.530
<v Speaker 2>hour.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Miki.</v>

2538
02:06:00.530 --> 02:06:00.600
<v Speaker 2>I've done it for a half an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I just want to relax,</v>

2539
02:06:00.900 --> 02:06:02.850
<v Speaker 2>I have something to do and I'm just </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to unwind.</v>

2540
02:06:02.851 --> 02:06:07.851
<v Speaker 2>I got three kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm thinking three hours signal </v>

2541
02:06:07.851 --> 02:06:08.780
<v Speaker 2>deprivation it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Two hours is good.</v>

2542
02:06:09.170 --> 02:06:11.300
<v Speaker 2>It helps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do it every time.</v>

2543
02:06:11.380 --> 02:06:12.060
<v Speaker 4>Come down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2544
02:06:12.240 --> 02:06:13.830
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What,</v>

2545
02:06:13.831 --> 02:06:14.850
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what helps about it?</v>

2546
02:06:15.970 --> 02:06:20.760
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you think in a clear fashion like things</v>

2547
02:06:20.761 --> 02:06:22.170
<v Speaker 4>are coming to you and I believe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2548
02:06:22.200 --> 02:06:23.070
<v Speaker 4>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

2549
02:06:23.130 --> 02:06:28.130
<v Speaker 4>you're able to kind of work through it a</v>
<v Speaker 4>little bit better where there's no </v>

2550
02:06:28.130 --> 02:06:28.130
<v Speaker 4>distractions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The distractions,</v>

2551
02:06:28.130 --> 02:06:28.530
<v Speaker 4>there's not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2552
02:06:28.550 --> 02:06:30.470
<v Speaker 4>you don't got other stuff going on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

2553
02:06:30.560 --> 02:06:35.560
<v Speaker 4>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I work better internalizing things like </v>

2554
02:06:35.560 --> 02:06:38.871
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like Was talking about the counseling </v>

2555
02:06:38.871 --> 02:06:41.241
<v Speaker 4>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's just my personality would never </v>

2556
02:06:41.241 --> 02:06:43.851
<v Speaker 4>work because uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the person I'm talking to doesn't know </v>

2557
02:06:43.851 --> 02:06:46.401
<v Speaker 4>what I went through,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but in my own mind when my own dialogue </v>

2558
02:06:46.401 --> 02:06:49.920
<v Speaker 4>is talking to me back because I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the last time I was talking to,</v>

2559
02:06:49.950 --> 02:06:53.780
<v Speaker 4>I remember talking to myself and I was </v>
<v Speaker 4>talking back to me it was,</v>

2560
02:06:53.840 --> 02:06:54.750
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was very,</v>

2561
02:06:55.020 --> 02:07:00.020
<v Speaker 4>it was very strange.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that's what was happening was I was </v>

2562
02:07:00.020 --> 02:07:02.961
<v Speaker 4>bringing up things and I was talking and</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was responding in fashion with what I </v>

2563
02:07:03.301 --> 02:07:05.610
<v Speaker 4>was talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like calming myself down.</v>

2564
02:07:05.611 --> 02:07:06.930
<v Speaker 4>And it just worked better</v>

2565
02:07:08.020 --> 02:07:10.490
<v Speaker 2>the way I describe it as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first 20 minutes or so,</v>

2566
02:07:10.570 --> 02:07:13.330
<v Speaker 2>me and the tank is sort of like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>seminar on my own life.</v>

2567
02:07:13.850 --> 02:07:18.850
<v Speaker 2>So giving myself advice because the mine</v>
<v Speaker 2>untethered from the body's very </v>

2568
02:07:18.850 --> 02:07:23.131
<v Speaker 2>difficult to get to that state unless </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're doing some really fucking heavy </v>

2569
02:07:23.131 --> 02:07:26.190
<v Speaker 2>meditation for long periods of time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very difficult to achieve this kind</v>

2570
02:07:26.200 --> 02:07:31.200
<v Speaker 2>of state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get in an isolation tank after half </v>

2571
02:07:31.200 --> 02:07:31.200
<v Speaker 2>an hour just floating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It takes me a while to get there.</v>

2572
02:07:31.360 --> 02:07:32.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to compensate.</v>

2573
02:07:32.300 --> 02:07:33.170
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

2574
02:07:33.200 --> 02:07:34.550
<v Speaker 2>I mean I don't do it often.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2575
02:07:34.560 --> 02:07:36.220
<v Speaker 2>that's a big of it too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It takes me a while,</v>

2576
02:07:36.221 --> 02:07:39.280
<v Speaker 2>but once I'm there it yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it does help.</v>

2577
02:07:39.281 --> 02:07:43.360
<v Speaker 2>I do leave clear and it is something </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I think is a benefit,</v>

2578
02:07:43.361 --> 02:07:46.780
<v Speaker 2>especially for things like ptsd and </v>
<v Speaker 2>mental issue.</v>

2579
02:07:46.781 --> 02:07:48.910
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you had one near you and you could do</v>

2580
02:07:48.911 --> 02:07:53.911
<v Speaker 2>it on a regular basis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it would help even more because </v>

2581
02:07:53.911 --> 02:07:55.120
<v Speaker 2>it's part of it is relaxing with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience itself.</v>

2582
02:07:55.210 --> 02:07:57.880
<v Speaker 2>The experience to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I have one of my basement,</v>

2583
02:07:57.881 --> 02:08:00.550
<v Speaker 2>it's a very natural part of life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go in there all the time,</v>

2584
02:08:00.551 --> 02:08:02.080
<v Speaker 2>so it's a natural thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like,</v>

2585
02:08:02.081 --> 02:08:03.130
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are we doing here?</v>

2586
02:08:03.370 --> 02:08:04.600
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here We go again.</v>

2587
02:08:04.630 --> 02:08:05.710
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's normal.</v>

2588
02:08:05.711 --> 02:08:07.930
<v Speaker 2>It's almost over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>buddy.</v>

2589
02:08:08.150 --> 02:08:10.210
<v Speaker 2>The other thing too was for me with my </v>
<v Speaker 2>body,</v>

2590
02:08:10.211 --> 02:08:11.260
<v Speaker 2>just wIth paint,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2591
02:08:11.261 --> 02:08:16.261
<v Speaker 2>I'm used to walking around at a certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>comfort level of just the way my body </v>

2592
02:08:16.261 --> 02:08:17.900
<v Speaker 2>works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some laying down in there when my body's</v>

2593
02:08:17.950 --> 02:08:20.800
<v Speaker 2>not supporting itself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was able to let that go.</v>

2594
02:08:21.330 --> 02:08:26.330
<v Speaker 2>I let that go and just kind of focused </v>
<v Speaker 2>like I said on my mind and that's a huge</v>

2595
02:08:27.370 --> 02:08:28.050
<v Speaker 2>thing for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I.</v>

2596
02:08:28.900 --> 02:08:32.590
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't until I did that the first </v>
<v Speaker 2>time that I realized how much my body is</v>

2597
02:08:32.591 --> 02:08:34.300
<v Speaker 2>impacting my mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2598
02:08:34.450 --> 02:08:37.420
<v Speaker 2>really just because you get used to </v>
<v Speaker 2>feeling a certain way the whole time,</v>

2599
02:08:37.421 --> 02:08:41.140
<v Speaker 2>especially with like pain or my leg or </v>
<v Speaker 2>my knees.</v>

2600
02:08:41.380 --> 02:08:44.110
<v Speaker 2>You take that out of the equation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2601
02:08:44.310 --> 02:08:45.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your mind's like,</v>

2602
02:08:45.281 --> 02:08:50.281
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this let's we can focus on something </v>

2603
02:08:50.281 --> 02:08:50.860
<v Speaker 2>else and that it is nice and besides the</v>
<v Speaker 2>alleviation of pressure,</v>

2604
02:08:50.890 --> 02:08:52.570
<v Speaker 2>because you're not carrying your weight </v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore,</v>

2605
02:08:52.571 --> 02:08:57.571
<v Speaker 2>there's also absent salts in it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is an excellent source of </v>

2606
02:08:57.571 --> 02:08:57.950
<v Speaker 2>magnesium,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which also relaxes the muscle.</v>

2607
02:08:57.951 --> 02:08:59.950
<v Speaker 2>So you got like sort of a dual effect </v>
<v Speaker 2>going on.</v>

2608
02:09:00.220 --> 02:09:03.190
<v Speaker 2>You have this no gravity effect because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're completely floating,</v>

2609
02:09:03.250 --> 02:09:07.360
<v Speaker 2>you're bobbing in this water and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>you also have this magnesium when,</v>

2610
02:09:07.361 --> 02:09:12.361
<v Speaker 2>and this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that people always </v>

2611
02:09:12.361 --> 02:09:13.891
<v Speaker 2>recommend for muscle soreness is epson </v>
<v Speaker 2>salts and this delivery method of </v>

2612
02:09:14.740 --> 02:09:19.740
<v Speaker 2>getting the magnesium through your skin </v>
<v Speaker 2>that way supposed to be excellent as </v>

2613
02:09:19.740 --> 02:09:19.740
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the biggest organ in the body.</v>

2614
02:09:19.740 --> 02:09:24.420
<v Speaker 2>So it absorbs a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do we need to do to help more </v>

2615
02:09:24.420 --> 02:09:25.180
<v Speaker 2>people out here with this?</v>

2616
02:09:25.180 --> 02:09:29.080
<v Speaker 2>To spread the word out about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about what you are doing.</v>

2617
02:09:29.380 --> 02:09:34.380
<v Speaker 2>And matthew,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thank you very much for doing this and </v>

<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

2620
02:09:34.840 --> 02:09:36.690
<v Speaker 2>this is a very important issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2621
02:09:36.691 --> 02:09:41.691
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think all the things that we've </v>

2622
02:09:41.691 --> 02:09:41.691
<v Speaker 2>discussed here today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2623
02:09:41.691 --> 02:09:46.030
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the benefits I think could really </v>

2624
02:09:46.030 --> 02:09:47.080
<v Speaker 2>greatly help a lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how do we,</v>

2625
02:09:47.081 --> 02:09:48.550
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do we spread this?</v>

2626
02:09:48.940 --> 02:09:51.250
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as we found out in january,</v>

2627
02:09:51.310 --> 02:09:56.310
<v Speaker 2>you had an impressive response curve for</v>
<v Speaker 2>the program that we did.</v>

2628
02:09:56.770 --> 02:09:58.090
<v Speaker 2>We talked about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2629
02:09:58.760 --> 02:10:02.200
<v Speaker 2>big foot and we talked about narrows and</v>
<v Speaker 2>we talked about,</v>

2630
02:10:04.740 --> 02:10:05.710
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the injection,</v>

2631
02:10:06.490 --> 02:10:11.490
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything we've talked about and then </v>

2632
02:10:11.490 --> 02:10:13.770
<v Speaker 3>lead up to this area of tbi.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think finding A multitude of avenues.</v>

2633
02:10:14.711 --> 02:10:19.711
<v Speaker 3>That's why I've been dragging matthew </v>
<v Speaker 3>with me to some of the guys that I know </v>

2634
02:10:19.711 --> 02:10:23.431
<v Speaker 3>around the states that have shows not </v>
<v Speaker 3>similar to yours but not as grand and </v>

2635
02:10:25.510 --> 02:10:30.510
<v Speaker 3>have each helped to make a little dent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we just need someone to come up and </v>

2636
02:10:30.701 --> 02:10:35.701
<v Speaker 3>champion a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to get in touch with howard </v>

2637
02:10:35.701 --> 02:10:37.460
<v Speaker 3>schultz,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's the ceo of starbucks who,</v>

2638
02:10:37.540 --> 02:10:42.540
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yesterday I had this really great </v>

2639
02:10:42.540 --> 02:10:45.370
<v Speaker 3>statement he made that we need to honor </v>
<v Speaker 3>our vets by giving them a concert and a </v>

2640
02:10:45.381 --> 02:10:48.830
<v Speaker 3>job now in order for them to go to that </v>
<v Speaker 3>concert.</v>

2641
02:10:48.831 --> 02:10:52.130
<v Speaker 3>And I appreciate and enjoy it and have </v>
<v Speaker 3>that job.</v>

2642
02:10:52.160 --> 02:10:57.160
<v Speaker 3>We have to fix the underlying problem </v>
<v Speaker 3>not to mask it and therefore letting </v>

2643
02:10:58.370 --> 02:11:02.450
<v Speaker 3>vets know that there is an option and </v>
<v Speaker 3>next year,</v>

2644
02:11:02.530 --> 02:11:06.230
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>april of finished my book by january and</v>

2645
02:11:06.231 --> 02:11:11.231
<v Speaker 3>then put on a class which will be </v>
<v Speaker 3>limited to a hundred docs to come in to </v>

2646
02:11:11.601 --> 02:11:16.601
<v Speaker 3>be trained in this process,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these protocols which are relatively </v>

2647
02:11:16.601 --> 02:11:16.601
<v Speaker 3>simple,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2648
02:11:17.180 --> 02:11:22.180
<v Speaker 3>and then go out and start being </v>
<v Speaker 3>representative of an alternative to </v>

2649
02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:25.010
<v Speaker 3>antidepressants,</v>
<v Speaker 3>antianxiety meds,</v>

2650
02:11:25.450 --> 02:11:30.450
<v Speaker 6>bit of an uphill battle that has to be </v>
<v Speaker 6>fought also with the idea of </v>

2651
02:11:30.450 --> 02:11:33.720
<v Speaker 6>supplementing hormones to achieve a </v>
<v Speaker 6>balance in the body.</v>

2652
02:11:33.721 --> 02:11:36.690
<v Speaker 6>Because a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when they think of soldiers,</v>

2653
02:11:36.990 --> 02:11:41.990
<v Speaker 6>what do they think of?</v>
<v Speaker 6>They think of these testosterone fueled </v>

2654
02:11:41.990 --> 02:11:42.480
<v Speaker 6>savage men.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then,</v>

2655
02:11:42.481 --> 02:11:45.240
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you add testosterone to that boy,</v>

2656
02:11:45.260 --> 02:11:50.260
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like you're just gonna make more </v>

2657
02:11:50.260 --> 02:11:50.260
<v Speaker 6>aggressive,</v>
<v Speaker 6>crazier.</v>

2658
02:11:50.260 --> 02:11:52.760
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't work that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The reason what is up yet,</v>

2659
02:11:53.080 --> 02:11:56.800
<v Speaker 3>it's uphill battle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If they weren't in the military,</v>

2660
02:11:56.830 --> 02:12:01.830
<v Speaker 3>they go into a clinic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now what's happening is you might have </v>

2661
02:12:01.830 --> 02:12:02.350
<v Speaker 3>low testosterone syndrome,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's check you.</v>

2662
02:12:02.351 --> 02:12:07.351
<v Speaker 3>And they do two tests.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I find that they're low </v>

2663
02:12:07.351 --> 02:12:09.121
<v Speaker 3>testosterone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they don't know the cause for it </v>

2664
02:12:09.121 --> 02:12:11.131
<v Speaker 3>because they didn't do an extensive </v>
<v Speaker 3>enough to say that it's due to head </v>

2665
02:12:11.131 --> 02:12:11.131
<v Speaker 3>trauma,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2666
02:12:11.131 --> 02:12:15.301
<v Speaker 3>whichever way they can do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to get guys onto a ask the history of </v>

2667
02:12:15.301 --> 02:12:16.540
<v Speaker 3>trauma,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do the lab tests and get them on it,</v>

2668
02:12:16.541 --> 02:12:21.541
<v Speaker 3>but the resistance is because of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>controversy that has always stood there </v>

2669
02:12:21.541 --> 02:12:25.621
<v Speaker 3>with testosterone and with the balco and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the barry bonds and all these things </v>

2670
02:12:26.200 --> 02:12:30.610
<v Speaker 3>relative to public guide that negative.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They demonized growth hormone,</v>

2671
02:12:30.611 --> 02:12:34.930
<v Speaker 3>they demonized testosterone instead of </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about the benefits of it and how</v>

2672
02:12:34.931 --> 02:12:37.810
<v Speaker 3>it could be utilized in this specific </v>
<v Speaker 3>situation and it works.</v>

2673
02:12:38.050 --> 02:12:40.510
<v Speaker 3>So anyone who's listening,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2674
02:12:41.220 --> 02:12:46.220
<v Speaker 3>I know someone who might be there to </v>
<v Speaker 3>connect us with the right people in </v>

2675
02:12:46.220 --> 02:12:47.960
<v Speaker 3>government and so forth to go and do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is the issue.</v>

2676
02:12:48.140 --> 02:12:49.550
<v Speaker 6>Knee jerk reaction,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

2677
02:12:50.060 --> 02:12:52.700
<v Speaker 6>Immediately people want to think of it </v>
<v Speaker 6>as like,</v>

2678
02:12:52.990 --> 02:12:54.500
<v Speaker 6>this is a.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is a cheating thing.</v>

2679
02:12:54.530 --> 02:12:55.430
<v Speaker 6>This is a bad thing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

2680
02:12:55.610 --> 02:12:57.080
<v Speaker 6>Just like the salt thing that we were </v>
<v Speaker 6>talking,</v>

2681
02:12:57.530 --> 02:13:02.530
<v Speaker 3>we'll stop everybody's estrogen </v>
<v Speaker 3>replacement stopped everybody's insulin </v>

2682
02:13:02.530 --> 02:13:06.530
<v Speaker 3>replacement or thyroid replacement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Our body had it from when we were born,</v>

2683
02:13:06.920 --> 02:13:09.460
<v Speaker 3>so why do we assume that it's not </v>
<v Speaker 3>necessary?</v>

2684
02:13:09.461 --> 02:13:14.461
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've had a number of women who came in </v>

2685
02:13:14.461 --> 02:13:15.890
<v Speaker 3>who were significantly testosterone </v>
<v Speaker 3>deficient with the all the symptoms that</v>

2686
02:13:15.930 --> 02:13:18.290
<v Speaker 3>a woman get from testosterone </v>
<v Speaker 3>deficiency.</v>

2687
02:13:18.590 --> 02:13:21.620
<v Speaker 3>they're not nice to be around and their </v>
<v Speaker 3>doctor says,</v>

2688
02:13:21.621 --> 02:13:22.490
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't need it.</v>

2689
02:13:22.491 --> 02:13:26.330
<v Speaker 3>You just need your estrogen replaced and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't even replace the progesterone</v>

2690
02:13:26.331 --> 02:13:29.030
<v Speaker 3>and you need to have that balance so </v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't get sleep deprivation.</v>

2691
02:13:29.031 --> 02:13:30.470
<v Speaker 3>Developed depression,</v>
<v Speaker 3>panic attack,</v>

2692
02:13:30.471 --> 02:13:32.100
<v Speaker 3>and ended up in the emergency room every</v>
<v Speaker 3>two weeks</v>

2693
02:13:32.100 --> 02:13:32.970
<v Speaker 2>like we see.</v>

2694
02:13:34.050 --> 02:13:39.050
<v Speaker 7>My thing too is that I think,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't think this is a cure for </v>

2695
02:13:39.050 --> 02:13:42.801
<v Speaker 7>everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Every single person is going to fall </v>

2696
02:13:42.801 --> 02:13:42.801
<v Speaker 7>into this category.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You went to war,</v>

2697
02:13:42.801 --> 02:13:44.880
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you suffered some through some stuff and</v>

2698
02:13:44.881 --> 02:13:47.250
<v Speaker 7>now here's your cure.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't think that's what it is,</v>

2699
02:13:47.251 --> 02:13:50.970
<v Speaker 7>but I think that there's a.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There's a two stages here.</v>

2700
02:13:50.971 --> 02:13:53.250
<v Speaker 7>There's the stage where,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2701
02:13:53.251 --> 02:13:58.251
<v Speaker 7>like math,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you talked about where he admitted he </v>

2702
02:13:58.251 --> 02:13:59.580
<v Speaker 7>didn't feel okay and he was willing to </v>
<v Speaker 7>go seek some help for it,</v>

2703
02:14:00.090 --> 02:14:03.090
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and hopefully this movie you're watching</v>

2704
02:14:03.091 --> 02:14:05.700
<v Speaker 7>chris,</v>
<v Speaker 7>who's a guy who was tough as nails,</v>

2705
02:14:05.701 --> 02:14:07.380
<v Speaker 7>he was the baddest,</v>
<v Speaker 7>baddest,</v>

2706
02:14:07.670 --> 02:14:09.030
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>seal there ever was.</v>

2707
02:14:09.600 --> 02:14:14.600
<v Speaker 7>He found a way to admit that he didn't </v>
<v Speaker 7>feel okay and went and sought some help </v>

2708
02:14:14.600 --> 02:14:16.410
<v Speaker 7>for it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Then then in seeking help,</v>

2709
02:14:16.620 --> 02:14:19.230
<v Speaker 7>there needs to be more pragmatic </v>
<v Speaker 7>solutions.</v>

2710
02:14:19.500 --> 02:14:21.360
<v Speaker 7>Like right now we're looking at the </v>
<v Speaker 7>thing and it's like,</v>

2711
02:14:21.540 --> 02:14:23.490
<v Speaker 7>it's a grab bag,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2712
02:14:23.491 --> 02:14:27.600
<v Speaker 7>and to me this feels like a,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a mind body solution.</v>

2713
02:14:27.990 --> 02:14:30.570
<v Speaker 7>This isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 7>this isn't freudian counseling,</v>

2714
02:14:30.870 --> 02:14:32.820
<v Speaker 7>this isn't some lady sitting there,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2715
02:14:33.030 --> 02:14:35.910
<v Speaker 7>god bless these women who work at the va</v>
<v Speaker 7>in the men too.</v>

2716
02:14:35.911 --> 02:14:38.550
<v Speaker 7>Who are these counselors?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Did they go through hell?</v>

2717
02:14:38.670 --> 02:14:40.410
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>imagine sitting there every day.</v>

2718
02:14:40.740 --> 02:14:45.740
<v Speaker 7>They're on the clock,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they're seeing guys on their lunch </v>

2719
02:14:45.740 --> 02:14:45.740
<v Speaker 7>breaks.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They're seeing people After work.</v>

2720
02:14:45.740 --> 02:14:47.580
<v Speaker 7>They have huge hearts,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but they can't handle it,</v>

2721
02:14:47.820 --> 02:14:49.980
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and after awhile you shut down,</v>

2722
02:14:50.160 --> 02:14:53.370
<v Speaker 7>you hear this story over and over again,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you see the misery and it's just like,</v>

2723
02:14:53.460 --> 02:14:55.890
<v Speaker 7>it just sucks the life out of them,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2724
02:14:56.190 --> 02:14:59.550
<v Speaker 7>and,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and so I don't think that's the solution</v>

2725
02:14:59.551 --> 02:15:00.900
<v Speaker 7>for everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think that there's,</v>

2726
02:15:01.470 --> 02:15:02.280
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there's a,</v>

2727
02:15:02.281 --> 02:15:04.200
<v Speaker 7>there's a number of things that are </v>
<v Speaker 7>going to help people,</v>

2728
02:15:04.470 --> 02:15:08.120
<v Speaker 7>but If this,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if seeking blood work and seeking a mind</v>

2729
02:15:08.121 --> 02:15:12.470
<v Speaker 7>body solution through medicine is </v>
<v Speaker 7>available and,</v>

2730
02:15:12.640 --> 02:15:17.640
<v Speaker 7>and is out there in the public and is </v>
<v Speaker 7>getting vetted through other doctors </v>

2731
02:15:17.640 --> 02:15:22.131
<v Speaker 7>and,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and spread among the medical community </v>

2732
02:15:22.131 --> 02:15:22.170
<v Speaker 7>than these guys have a chance.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But if it's not,</v>

2733
02:15:22.171 --> 02:15:25.500
<v Speaker 7>if it's just one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 7>one doctor sit in here and uh,</v>

2734
02:15:25.501 --> 02:15:30.501
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>some guy in Missouri is not gonna make </v>

2735
02:15:30.501 --> 02:15:30.501
<v Speaker 7>it out to see Dr.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Gordon.</v>

2736
02:15:30.501 --> 02:15:33.690
<v Speaker 2>I think it's really important that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>said what you said about the it's not </v>

2737
02:15:33.690 --> 02:15:36.580
<v Speaker 2>the solution for everybody and it's only</v>
<v Speaker 2>one part of it that what we said before,</v>

2738
02:15:36.581 --> 02:15:41.140
<v Speaker 2>thIs is a holistic approach,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you don't heal the body,</v>

2739
02:15:41.590 --> 02:15:45.700
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be incredibly difficult to</v>
<v Speaker 2>put the mind at peace and it's healing.</v>

2740
02:15:45.701 --> 02:15:48.220
<v Speaker 2>The body's not necessarily going to put </v>
<v Speaker 2>the mind at peace,</v>

2741
02:15:48.280 --> 02:15:51.070
<v Speaker 2>but it's a step in the right direction </v>
<v Speaker 2>where there's.</v>

2742
02:15:51.250 --> 02:15:56.250
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's you have nothing to lose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You do it and you try and if that's not </v>

2743
02:15:58.150 --> 02:16:00.610
<v Speaker 2>really what's going on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you take the next step,</v>

2744
02:16:00.790 --> 02:16:03.980
<v Speaker 2>but you don't know if you don't look.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2745
02:16:03.990 --> 02:16:05.170
<v Speaker 2>you don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't know.</v>

2746
02:16:05.171 --> 02:16:10.171
<v Speaker 2>And matthew came down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we took a look and it's a simple blood </v>

2747
02:16:10.171 --> 02:16:10.171
<v Speaker 2>test.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Simple blood work.</v>

2748
02:16:10.630 --> 02:16:14.140
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so for the guy out there or the gal with</v>

2749
02:16:14.141 --> 02:16:19.141
<v Speaker 2>ptsd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with depression that's dealing with the </v>

2750
02:16:19.141 --> 02:16:20.880
<v Speaker 2>things that they have some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>traumatic brain injuries in their past,</v>

2751
02:16:20.881 --> 02:16:22.950
<v Speaker 2>it could be contributing to this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's their step?</v>

2752
02:16:22.960 --> 02:16:24.250
<v Speaker 2>What do they do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2753
02:16:24.251 --> 02:16:27.910
<v Speaker 2>they can go to the website which is tbi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>medlegal.com.</v>

2754
02:16:27.970 --> 02:16:29.200
<v Speaker 2>Tbi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>medlegal,</v>

2755
02:16:29.250 --> 02:16:30.460
<v Speaker 2>tbi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>med</v>

2756
02:16:30.460 --> 02:16:35.010
<v Speaker 3>legal.com</v>
<v Speaker 3>and put in an application and those that</v>

2757
02:16:35.011 --> 02:16:39.360
<v Speaker 3>are coming through and it asks military </v>
<v Speaker 3>and asked the type of injury you had and</v>

2758
02:16:39.361 --> 02:16:44.361
<v Speaker 3>what medications you're on and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>military get put into a separate </v>

2759
02:16:44.361 --> 02:16:46.680
<v Speaker 3>grouping and we're waiting for funding </v>
<v Speaker 3>to come in.</v>

2760
02:16:47.040 --> 02:16:52.040
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that we can start takIng more of the </v>

2761
02:16:52.040 --> 02:16:53.721
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is the laboratory testing has </v>

2762
02:16:53.721 --> 02:16:56.250
<v Speaker 3>always been a 100 percent covered.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The treatment wasn't met,</v>

2763
02:16:56.251 --> 02:16:58.500
<v Speaker 3>paid for some of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I help him in his,</v>

2764
02:16:58.610 --> 02:17:03.610
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in all their situation and we're hoping </v>

2765
02:17:03.610 --> 02:17:03.610
<v Speaker 3>to get someone who will champion with </v>
<v Speaker 3>some money.</v>

2766
02:17:03.610 --> 02:17:08.481
<v Speaker 3>I had one patient offer a significant </v>
<v Speaker 3>amount and that'll help to cover about </v>

2767
02:17:08.481 --> 02:17:10.740
<v Speaker 3>100 patients.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it'll cover everything for a year and</v>

2768
02:17:10.741 --> 02:17:14.130
<v Speaker 3>cost for treatment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I meAn the blended to start from that we</v>

2769
02:17:14.131 --> 02:17:19.050
<v Speaker 3>developed about 10 years ago is $100 for</v>
<v Speaker 3>six months supply.</v>

2770
02:17:19.460 --> 02:17:21.260
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>let's talk about doing something through</v>

2771
02:17:21.261 --> 02:17:26.261
<v Speaker 6>this show and let's talk about promoting</v>
<v Speaker 6>something like maybe through a </v>

2772
02:17:26.261 --> 02:17:26.600
<v Speaker 6>kickstarter or go fund me or something </v>
<v Speaker 6>like that at all.</v>

2773
02:17:26.601 --> 02:17:31.601
<v Speaker 6>Contribute to it and we'll try to get </v>
<v Speaker 6>other people to contribute to it and </v>

2774
02:17:31.601 --> 02:17:32.730
<v Speaker 6>let's just try to get something where </v>
<v Speaker 6>there's at least</v>
