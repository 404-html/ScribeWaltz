1
00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:12.483
You

2
00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:19.030
recognize this man as the voice saying the Joe Rogan podcast,

3
00:00:19.031 --> 00:00:20.980
check it out.
You might know him from the UFC,

4
00:00:20.981 --> 00:00:22.990
one of the top welterweight contenders in the world.

5
00:00:22.991 --> 00:00:24.520
You might know him from Metamorris,

6
00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:28.570
which is probably the premiere grappling event in North America.

7
00:00:28.571 --> 00:00:32.380
We just competed this past weekend.
Brian McDonald,
ladies and gentlemen,

8
00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.710
somebody now much man,
thanks for having me.
Thanks for doing this.

9
00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.450
So you're in town,
you,
uh,

10
00:00:37.451 --> 00:00:42.451
you did some competing at metamorris against such a tourist who saw top level

11
00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.090
Brazilian Jiu Jitsu competitor.
Yeah,
really,
really good.

12
00:00:46.091 --> 00:00:51.010
And that's unusual that a guy who's in your position who's a top welterweight

13
00:00:51.011 --> 00:00:55.730
contender in MMA decides to test himself in Brazilian Jujitsu.

14
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.310
Why,
why did you decide to do that?

15
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.060
<v 0>I think I want to test myself in as many martial arts as I can.</v>

16
00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.300
That's why I kinda got into it and why I started fighting,
you know,

17
00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.770
the whole competitive and testing my martial arts skill against someone else at

18
00:01:09.771 --> 00:01:12.020
the highest level,
you know?
So,
uh,

19
00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.180
metamorris was a great setup.
I like the rules,
the concept of it.

20
00:01:17.181 --> 00:01:20.510
So I asked if I could be a part of it and you know,
all worked out.

21
00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:24.350
<v 1>Oh that's cool.
So you approach them?
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's interesting man.</v>

22
00:01:24.351 --> 00:01:27.920
You know Metamorris F for folks who don't know the idea behind it is they don't

23
00:01:27.921 --> 00:01:31.300
have any points which I like.
I like that.
Um,

24
00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.100
I almost kind of wish they had no time limit.
You know,

25
00:01:34.101 --> 00:01:37.670
like the time limit is kind of like real Jujitsu.

26
00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.090
Like when you talked to like hoists are you talk to,
you know,

27
00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:41.990
a Leo back in the day they would do it.

28
00:01:41.991 --> 00:01:45.830
Say you know that especially in mixed martial arts,
they need time.

29
00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.130
Like they're all about just a war of attrition.

30
00:01:49.131 --> 00:01:52.970
Just slowly but surely keeping a pace on a guy until he makes a mistake and then

31
00:01:52.971 --> 00:01:53.870
you eventually catch them.

32
00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:59.170
But a lot of the metamorris are matches like yours w go to draw cause after 20

33
00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.800
it's 20 minute time limit for yours.
Yep.

34
00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.360
They go to 20 minute time limit and if no one has submitted each other,

35
00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:07.760
it winds up being a draw.
But you guys were both going for it.

36
00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:12.320
It was only a draw because the timer now me were you attacked with a leg lock

37
00:02:12.321 --> 00:02:14.150
that got pretty close?
He attacked with Kamora.

38
00:02:14.151 --> 00:02:16.570
I mean it was a pretty wild fast paced match.

39
00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.160
<v 0>Yeah,
there was a lot that happened.</v>

40
00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.720
If there was points he would have definitely beat me.
But uh,
you know,

41
00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:24.340
like you were saying,
it's,
it's,

42
00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.360
it's nice to have no points so you can maybe you're more comfortable working on

43
00:02:31.111 --> 00:02:36.111
a sack patrol on the bottom rather than guard or so you're not too worried about

44
00:02:36.611 --> 00:02:40.960
letting him pass or getting mount or something,
you know.
So like if you've seen,

45
00:02:40.961 --> 00:02:45.250
um,
Gary Tonin,
he lets guys mountain biking leg lock him.

46
00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:51.110
I train with that guy.
I won't mount him cause you know,
it's uh,
I like the,

47
00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.230
<v 1>like what does he do?
Does he do the legs over the top and does he know?
He does.</v>

48
00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:56.143
How does he,

49
00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.350
<v 0>he does like a kipping a thing with his legs.</v>

50
00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.830
He'll get his hips underneath of you.
Then Hill Hill,
uh,

51
00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.080
what are the Asher grammy take the leg.

52
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.090
<v 1>So he goes sideways.
So he almost doesn't want 80 and takes the leg.</v>

53
00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:13.120
Oh yeah.
If you watched the match,
you'll see him do it.

54
00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.630
There's a lot of guys that are coming up with all these wild techniques now.

55
00:03:16.631 --> 00:03:18.290
I was just watching some,
uh,

56
00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:23.610
Jeff Glover has some crazy new technique where he goes from being caught inside

57
00:03:23.771 --> 00:03:27.370
control to a heal hook.
He like,
he was demonstrating it,

58
00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:31.270
but it's just the beautiful thing about Jujitsu,

59
00:03:31.271 --> 00:03:34.570
one of the most amazing things about you git to is it seems to be constantly

60
00:03:34.571 --> 00:03:35.800
changing and evolving.

61
00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.400
Like MMA is evolving and changing constantly in MMA is constantly incorporating

62
00:03:42.131 --> 00:03:46.810
techniques that we already knew worked in in martial arts,
like,
uh,

63
00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.530
whether it's AI techniques or taekwondo techniques and you're seeing all these

64
00:03:50.531 --> 00:03:55.060
being introduced into MMA,
but we're not seeing like new striking techniques.

65
00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.700
The techniques have kind of been around for a long time.

66
00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:02.710
Whereas with Jujitsu it's like,
it seems like it never ends.

67
00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.200
<v 0>Yeah.
If you're away for like five months here,</v>

68
00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.040
you're behind the ball big time because there's so much going on all the time.

69
00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:12.970
<v 1>Isn't that weird?
Yeah,
it's weird.
It's a crazy,
but it's exciting.</v>

70
00:04:12.971 --> 00:04:17.370
It's exciting to be a part of what's one of my favorite,
uh,
martial arts?

71
00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.840
Cause I just think that it's,
there's a lot of good things about it where,

72
00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.860
first of all,
it's the martial art where a small person can beat a big person.

73
00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:30.910
Because when you watch like a Bruce Lee movie and you see some little guy just

74
00:04:30.911 --> 00:04:33.010
throwing flying kicks and knocking out all these big dudes,

75
00:04:33.011 --> 00:04:35.080
the reality of it is that,

76
00:04:35.081 --> 00:04:38.350
that there's a reason for weight classes and one of the big reasons is like for

77
00:04:38.351 --> 00:04:41.870
striking and for just overwhelming someone.
Yeah,

78
00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:45.890
weight classes are important,
but I've seen time and time again,

79
00:04:45.891 --> 00:04:50.891
smaller guys submit bigger guys and Jujitsu and that was the whole thing that

80
00:04:51.191 --> 00:04:55.120
was so impressive about hoists Gracie and their early days of the UFC since they

81
00:04:55.121 --> 00:04:56.050
didn't know Jujitsu,

82
00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.990
he was submitting guys were way bigger and stronger than him.

83
00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:03.750
<v 0>Yeah.
Yeah.
That's the great thing about you Jitsu.
You know,
when I started,</v>

84
00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:05.620
I was a tiny little kid,

85
00:05:05.621 --> 00:05:09.000
smaller than average when I first started at martial arts.

86
00:05:09.001 --> 00:05:13.530
And that's why I took the Jujitsu so fast because I was able to neutralize or

87
00:05:13.531 --> 00:05:14.820
even beat bigger guys.

88
00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:16.710
<v 1>Yeah.
Which doesn't really,
I mean,</v>

89
00:05:16.711 --> 00:05:20.980
you very rarely see that in kickboxing and guy has to be like way better.
Yeah.

90
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.140
They can overwhelm you with their power and size and smother you.
Right?

91
00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:28.110
Like Bob Sapp versus Ernesto hoost.
So perfect example.

92
00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:32.730
I've never seen that match.
Uh,
Jamie,
pull that up.
So people get,

93
00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:34.440
I don't know if that'll get us pull from youtube.

94
00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:39.400
That's whenever we say pulled from Youtube.
People are,
uh,

95
00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:44.070
taking shots now they're going to die.
Uh,
we'll,
we'll pull it up.

96
00:05:44.071 --> 00:05:48.030
So you get a people,
well,
if you've,
if you listening to this,

97
00:05:48.031 --> 00:05:53.031
just Google Bob sat versus Ernesto hoost and what Ernesto hoost was former k one

98
00:05:53.941 --> 00:05:54.930
grand Prix champion,

99
00:05:54.931 --> 00:05:59.870
one of the most technical kickboxers ever in the history of kickboxing.

100
00:05:59.871 --> 00:06:04.370
He was just a,
and he's actually fighting again now,
which is pretty incredible,

101
00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:09.050
but he was just a,
an amazing technical kickboxer.
And uh,

102
00:06:09.051 --> 00:06:14.000
he embodied that Dutch style of kickboxing,
very strong,
low kicks,

103
00:06:14.001 --> 00:06:15.020
really good boxing.

104
00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:20.260
And he fought this guy named Bob Sapp who was a former football player who was

105
00:06:21.021 --> 00:06:22.730
99% steroids.

106
00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:27.680
I mean he lives as Jews to the tits as a person he get,

107
00:06:27.681 --> 00:06:32.681
he was 350 pounds with abs and doesn't even look like a real person.

108
00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:37.100
Like when you see him get like that can't be real.
He's so big.

109
00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:42.430
And all he did was just overwhelm Ernesto who was just push him into the corner

110
00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:47.780
and just kinda donkey Kong them much technique there.
No,
very little.

111
00:06:47.781 --> 00:06:51.320
I mean it's all just size and mass and I mean even the way he's throwing his

112
00:06:51.321 --> 00:06:51.801
punches,

113
00:06:51.801 --> 00:06:56.801
he just winging his punches and he's one of the few guys that fade or milling

114
00:06:57.421 --> 00:07:01.580
and inco allegedly passed on fighting.
He didn't want to fight him.

115
00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:05.120
He just said,
listen to come on and stop.
Cause you know,

116
00:07:05.121 --> 00:07:09.730
Alfredo was the heavyweight champion.
He fought big guys.
He fought semi shelt.
Um,

117
00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:13.160
he fought that,
that giant Korean dude.
What was his name?

118
00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:17.960
The guy was literally a giant.
Remember that guy?
He fought big guys.

119
00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:19.650
You know,
in a small ring.

120
00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:24.110
It's not ideal for more technical guy either.
Right.

121
00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:27.070
You just get pushed up against the ropes.
He can't do anything there.

122
00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:30.140
So SAP eventually goes down from a,

123
00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:34.160
I think a leg kick or a left hook to the body.
He got hit with something.

124
00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:38.210
But to his credit,
he got up and I think it was the leg kicks.

125
00:07:38.211 --> 00:07:41.420
Ernesto hoost is just so beautiful and his technique,

126
00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:46.640
but he was being outweighed by about 150 pounds,
which is not a small guy.

127
00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:50.360
No,
I mean he's a heavyweight.
And uh,

128
00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:54.920
there's just an example of the difference between like say Jujitsu and

129
00:07:54.921 --> 00:07:55.580
kickboxing,

130
00:07:55.580 --> 00:08:00.580
because if this was like Hixon Gracie in his prime versus Bob Sapp and it was

131
00:08:00.591 --> 00:08:04.820
just a,
a Jujitsu match,
he would eventually get them.
He would hang on to them.

132
00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:06.650
Yeah.
So it was a leg kicked.
It dropped him.

133
00:08:06.651 --> 00:08:11.570
It looks like he was never good at taking damage.
Bob Sapp.
No,
he was not.
Well,

134
00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:15.560
he,
you know,
he had a relatively short time in fighting.

135
00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:19.640
And then along the way what he did was he,
you know,

136
00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:23.360
kind of just started taking dives like you would get hit.
I mean yeah,

137
00:08:23.361 --> 00:08:25.490
I mean he'd sell the fights and you know,

138
00:08:25.491 --> 00:08:30.050
make a big hype out of it and then somewhere along the line he just kind of,

139
00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:30.471
you know,

140
00:08:30.471 --> 00:08:33.770
we get hit and then he would go down in a fetal position but I think they

141
00:08:33.771 --> 00:08:38.150
stopped the fight right here.
Look,
it goes down.
It's incredible.

142
00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:40.760
Anyway,
we don't have to watch the rest of it,

143
00:08:40.761 --> 00:08:45.761
but it's the best example of the difference between Jujitsu and say kickboxing

144
00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:47.061
or,

145
00:08:47.061 --> 00:08:52.061
or striking where the size can make a pretty big difference cause skill wise,

146
00:08:53.151 --> 00:08:54.890
I mean you're dealing with like a blue belt there,

147
00:08:55.200 --> 00:09:00.200
a black belt in her Nasta who's to Jujitsu is also this martial art where

148
00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:05.130
leverage and technique and positions.
It's,

149
00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:09.840
it seems to be like this continual flow of techniques.

150
00:09:09.841 --> 00:09:13.080
Like you never,
you,
you,
you've never learned enough,

151
00:09:13.081 --> 00:09:14.400
you've never gotten good enough.

152
00:09:14.401 --> 00:09:18.540
And even guys who have been around it a long time,
when they stop learning,

153
00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:21.120
they stop applying new techniques to their game.

154
00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:24.750
You see them get beaten by young guys that have all this,

155
00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:27.960
these new techniques that they're just not familiar with the positions,
right.

156
00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:33.680
<v 0>Yeah.
Uh,
the,
the Jujitsu now,
it's definitely a lot different.
You know,</v>

157
00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:35.860
when I go to New York and train it,
hence those,

158
00:09:35.861 --> 00:09:40.861
like there's always something new that catches me by surprise for the first day

159
00:09:41.231 --> 00:09:42.430
or two.
You know what?
I have to,

160
00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:46.510
I have to make sure that I'm watching out for that.
So,
you know,

161
00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:50.260
even I get caught in it every second month going down there,
you know?

162
00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:51.700
<v 1>Yeah.
This isn't an,</v>

163
00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:55.880
Hanzo has just a fucking lines down of killers down there to just take a room of

164
00:09:55.881 --> 00:09:59.290
black belts.
Have you gone to 10 planet at all if you turn down here with Eddie?

165
00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:02.060
No,
but I'd like to,
I'll set it up.
Let me know when you want to go.

166
00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:05.390
He'll help you.
He's actually leg dragged him in the hall.
I met him.

167
00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:10.400
Was He just on his back?
He's got,
he's got a back problem right now.
Oh really?

168
00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:13.190
That probably didn't help it.
No,
no.
He's got a,

169
00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:18.080
he's dealing with some back spasms.
He's a,
he works as guard so much.

170
00:10:18.081 --> 00:10:20.360
It's like you so lower back intensive.

171
00:10:20.361 --> 00:10:24.470
So he's doing a lot of rehab stuff and we were talking about this before the

172
00:10:24.471 --> 00:10:28.640
show,
but that is a big issue with fighters is like back injuries,

173
00:10:28.930 --> 00:10:33.930
one of the most difficult to overcome because so many guys get 'em and then

174
00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:37.580
their,
their skill level deteriorates.
Whereas like if you get a knee injury,

175
00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:39.980
he gets sold a surgery on it.

176
00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:43.280
Like George Saint Pierre came back better than ever.
You know,

177
00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:47.060
the guys can come back from knee surgery.
Conor McGregor better than ever.

178
00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:49.560
<v 0>Right?
Um,
yeah.</v>

179
00:10:49.570 --> 00:10:54.030
I constantly have to be keeping up with my back maintenance.

180
00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:56.700
Like I had to pull it to a fight because of her neck problem.

181
00:10:57.030 --> 00:11:02.030
So my neck and back at a constant thing that I have to watch and have therapy

182
00:11:02.101 --> 00:11:05.520
down on two,
three times a week.
You know,

183
00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:09.930
what kind of therapy do you do a massage and Osteo all the time.

184
00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:14.100
It doesn't stop for me or else I just like stiffen up and I'm like,
you know,

185
00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:15.480
with the amount of training I'm doing,

186
00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:20.720
but I like to do like a warmup and cool down before every single training

187
00:11:21.241 --> 00:11:26.190
session with different exercises to like activate my muscles and my back

188
00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:30.180
stretching it.
Uh,
um,
he uh,

189
00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:35.280
I do a lot of planks like just like planking exercise that's pretty good for my

190
00:11:35.281 --> 00:11:39.540
back as well.
Um,
that machine you just showed me in the back.

191
00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:42.050
Yeah,
we have one of those that Tristar,

192
00:11:42.090 --> 00:11:43.750
I should probably start using that a lot more than

193
00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:47.060
<v 1>the things.
Incredible things.
Incredible.
It's so,
it was crazy.</v>

194
00:11:47.061 --> 00:11:49.130
We were talking about,
I was created by this Guy Louie Simmons,

195
00:11:49.131 --> 00:11:51.440
who's this power lifting legend who's like,

196
00:11:51.441 --> 00:11:54.850
I think he's 67 or something crazy like that,
who's just fucking enormous.

197
00:11:54.851 --> 00:11:55.730
Dude's still dead,

198
00:11:55.731 --> 00:12:00.280
lifts some insane amount of weight and he injured his back.

199
00:12:00.281 --> 00:12:03.610
They were going to do surgery,
they wanted a fuses disks and he wouldn't let him.

200
00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:08.710
And he figured out a way to make a machine that active actively decompresses

201
00:12:08.711 --> 00:12:11.530
your spine and strengthens it.
And the same time,

202
00:12:11.650 --> 00:12:14.170
it's very difficult to describe the motion.
So if anybody's interested,

203
00:12:14.171 --> 00:12:16.300
if you have any sort of a back injury,

204
00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:21.220
Google reverse hyper and uh,
I got mine from broke fitness,

205
00:12:21.221 --> 00:12:24.130
but there's a couple of companies that sell them including Westside Barbell,

206
00:12:24.131 --> 00:12:28.420
which is Louie Simmons Company.
Right.
But he invented it.
It amazing thing.

207
00:12:28.421 --> 00:12:29.410
But for fighters,

208
00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:34.300
just a giant tool to strengthen your core and build up your spinal column.

209
00:12:34.610 --> 00:12:38.110
They could see him.
He's like fucking 70 in this picture.

210
00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:42.100
It's enormous dude.
But the,

211
00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:46.840
the maintenance and um,
the uh,
physical therapy and all that stuff.

212
00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:47.920
How do you schedule that in?

213
00:12:47.921 --> 00:12:50.350
Do you have someone who does your schedule as far as like your,

214
00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.500
you do everything,
strength and conditioning,
all your stuff?

215
00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:58.260
<v 0>Yeah.
How do you organize it?
Just over time.
It just like Kinda,</v>

216
00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:02.040
you know,
I've been at Tristar for like seven years now,

217
00:13:02.190 --> 00:13:06.060
so like over time you kind of figure out what to take away,

218
00:13:06.061 --> 00:13:08.700
what to put in on that day and see what works out.

219
00:13:08.701 --> 00:13:13.701
So it's just a gradual progression of learning where things fit in on the,

220
00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:15.690
on certain days.

221
00:13:16.010 --> 00:13:18.780
<v 1>Do you have a g?
Do You keep a journal?
Like a training journal?
No.
No,</v>

222
00:13:18.830 --> 00:13:22.280
just all in your head now.
When you preparing for a fight,

223
00:13:22.281 --> 00:13:23.750
say if you have a big fight coming up,

224
00:13:23.751 --> 00:13:27.770
like your last fight with Terex caffeine and you're concentrating on a guy who's

225
00:13:27.771 --> 00:13:32.240
a kickboxer do go more kickboxing heavy.

226
00:13:32.241 --> 00:13:33.170
Do you do?

227
00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:36.080
<v 0>No,
not really.
It's,
I kinda just,</v>

228
00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:41.120
I kind of just go with my gut feeling or what I feel like I want to do at the

229
00:13:41.310 --> 00:13:45.670
period of time.
Um,
I've,
lately I've been doing a lot of Jujitsu.

230
00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:50.420
Um,
I've just been feeling excited about it,
so I followed that excitement.

231
00:13:50.421 --> 00:13:54.410
You know,
sometimes if like,
I really feel like doing a lot of kickboxing,

232
00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:59.270
so I find that my schedule is not completely kickboxing,

233
00:13:59.271 --> 00:14:02.270
but it dominates the week.
Mostly.

234
00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.270
<v 1>You're one of the few guys that's come along in MMA.</v>

235
00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:10.080
You like the new crop guys who didn't have a background in wrestling.

236
00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:14.220
You didn't have a background karate.
You're,
you're just from the beginning.

237
00:14:14.221 --> 00:14:15.600
You started in mixed martial arts.

238
00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:18.650
<v 0>Yeah,
yeah.
I started at 14,
uh,</v>

239
00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:22.230
Toshido mixed martial arts in Colona and uh,

240
00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:27.290
it was just lucky enough to stumble upon an MMA gym for my first martial arts,

241
00:14:27.930 --> 00:14:31.500
um,
GM.
So that's just how it,
it all came about.

242
00:14:32.010 --> 00:14:33.540
I would guess that was just a blessing.
You know,

243
00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:38.350
<v 1>you,
you,
you're not the type of guy,
like if I didn't know you,
yeah.
You know,</v>

244
00:14:38.351 --> 00:14:41.950
if I met you,
I was telling you,
listen,
normal,
peaceful dudes.
He was pretty,

245
00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:44.940
you know,
like there's,
she meets certain dudes and they got this cat.

246
00:14:44.941 --> 00:14:47.450
Like you've met Josh Barnett,
you're like,
yeah,
I could see that guy being a fire,

247
00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:52.010
a little fucking intense little,
a little high strung.
Yeah,
like mellow

248
00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:54.400
<v 2>and like even keeled.
I like to be.
Yeah.</v>

249
00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:58.520
Is that on purpose or is this just your personality naturally?

250
00:14:58.550 --> 00:15:01.580
I think nationally it is,
but then there's the other side too,
right?

251
00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:06.590
Where everyone calls me fucking psychos.
Well,
the,
I people were wondering like,

252
00:15:06.591 --> 00:15:08.980
what the fuck is this dude actually like because of like pull,

253
00:15:09.030 --> 00:15:13.400
pull up that this is fucking the,
the death stare.
The Roy McDonald desk,
dare,

254
00:15:14.690 --> 00:15:19.220
where is this?
Where's this coming from,
man?
Is that,

255
00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:21.780
is that just natural?
Does that,

256
00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:26.330
like this death stare that you have when you fight?
Are you aware of it

257
00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:30.270
<v 0>zone?
I guess you're not even blinking dude.
Yeah.
Well,</v>

258
00:15:30.810 --> 00:15:34.380
when I was fighting Terakki you,
he,
he,
he,
uh,
I caught him like,

259
00:15:34.381 --> 00:15:38.010
just staring at me when I was coming in and it Kinda made me like,

260
00:15:38.970 --> 00:15:41.130
I don't know what the best way to say it.
Kinda like Alpha male.

261
00:15:41.131 --> 00:15:44.250
Like I was just like,
you're like,
we were fighting for territory,

262
00:15:44.251 --> 00:15:45.660
so he was just like,
you know,

263
00:15:45.661 --> 00:15:49.760
like a couple of dogs staring down at each other before we were about to fight.

264
00:15:49.770 --> 00:15:51.240
I Dunno.
It kinda felt like that

265
00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:53.350
<v 2>some guys are telling you that,
you know,</v>

266
00:15:53.351 --> 00:15:56.680
boss route and you still avoid eye contact.
I didn't make eye contact.

267
00:15:56.681 --> 00:15:57.940
It doesn't bother me either way.

268
00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:02.740
<v 0>Like,
I don't think me staring at them,
it's gonna make me win the fight.
Right,</v>

269
00:16:02.810 --> 00:16:04.480
right,
right.
It has nothing to do with that.

270
00:16:04.850 --> 00:16:09.530
I totally believe in skill over any of the psychological battles or,

271
00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:14.600
uh,
you know,
being bigger or smaller.
But I guess it's,
uh,
it just,

272
00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:18.680
it just happens.
It just happens and you just go with it.
The same thing.
Yeah.

273
00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:22.160
You just like,
fuck this.
I'm staring them down.
Yeah.
Yeah.

274
00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:26.510
I'm not gonna I'm not gonna look away and make you make me feel like I'm a
bitch.

275
00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:32.250
<v 2>That's a weird moment though,
right?
Yeah,
it is awkward I guess.</v>

276
00:16:32.251 --> 00:16:36.470
But when you get into the octagon,
you know,
regardless on,
you know,

277
00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:38.730
who you're fighting,
like how important the is.

278
00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:42.300
Do you have like a routine that you go through mentally?

279
00:16:42.301 --> 00:16:44.500
Do you have like a preparation that you go through?
No.

280
00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:48.170
<v 0>If anything,
I'm just thinking about techniques and my head,</v>

281
00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:52.370
but sometimes I'm not thinking about anything.
I just can't wait to,

282
00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:53.353
they ring that bell

283
00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:56.780
<v 2>make you wait for so long anyway.
Is that the hardest part?</v>

284
00:16:56.781 --> 00:17:01.310
Is the anticipation not really kinda used to it by now.

285
00:17:02.450 --> 00:17:06.800
Has it become like as you've fought more and more guys higher and higher level,

286
00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:12.010
has it become more and more like a relaxed to you or more normal?

287
00:17:12.830 --> 00:17:15.020
Yeah,
it's normal.
Especially when you're fighting like,

288
00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:17.780
like I've been real busy the last year or two,

289
00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:22.160
so it's every fight now seems like it's just like,
it's,

290
00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:26.360
I remember this feeling.
Yeah,
that's big,
right?
Yeah,
it is.

291
00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:29.270
That's why you see the guy like Dominick Cruz,
it's out for three years.

292
00:17:29.271 --> 00:17:33.840
It makes his fight even more impressive when he just,
yeah,
he talked Mitzi Gawky.

293
00:17:33.850 --> 00:17:36.500
Yeah.
Steamrolled him.
Yeah.
He did do it very well.

294
00:17:36.530 --> 00:17:38.750
Incredible fucking look better than he's ever looked.

295
00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:42.080
When you see a guy like that though,
um,
you know,

296
00:17:42.081 --> 00:17:44.780
you're making a living off of your body.
I mean,

297
00:17:44.781 --> 00:17:49.680
you make a living with your body and your goals are predicated on the health of

298
00:17:49.681 --> 00:17:54.681
your body and you see like got a guy like Dominick Cruz who tore his ACL and

299
00:17:54.831 --> 00:17:58.170
then he tore his hamstring and tore his ACL again.
I mean,

300
00:17:58.171 --> 00:18:02.640
he allowed a lot fucking series of serious fucking injuries and shit almost

301
00:18:02.641 --> 00:18:06.600
three years out.
Does that freak you out when you see shit like that?

302
00:18:07.070 --> 00:18:11.740
<v 0>Yeah.
Yeah.
That would suck
a,</v>

303
00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:16.920
I guess.
Yeah,
just hope to God that never happens to me.
Yeah.
Yeah,

304
00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:18.920
that's,
that's a massive hurdle to overcome.

305
00:18:19.250 --> 00:18:23.450
Props to him for coming back and that guy.
But he's good too.

306
00:18:23.950 --> 00:18:26.690
He's very good.
He's very good.
He's,
he's like the

307
00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:29.070
<v 2>far cetera when it comes to footwork and movement.</v>

308
00:18:29.790 --> 00:18:34.320
When you see a guy like that who runs into such a massive hurdle,

309
00:18:34.321 --> 00:18:36.600
like a three year absence from the sport like that,

310
00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:40.560
does that make you change your preparation any way or be a little bit more

311
00:18:40.561 --> 00:18:45.561
cautious or be a little bit more diligent about strength and conditioning or

312
00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:47.873
rehab

313
00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:52.470
<v 0>didn't like that?
No.
Like other people's lives don't really influence mine.</v>

314
00:18:52.471 --> 00:18:57.180
I'm just,
I just,
uh,
I feel like I go with the flow a lot,

315
00:18:57.181 --> 00:18:59.930
you know,
if,
uh,
you know,

316
00:19:00.090 --> 00:19:03.690
if I see something that movie beneficial to me,
then I'll do it.
Or if I'm,

317
00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:06.630
I want to go a certain direction and my martial arts career,

318
00:19:06.631 --> 00:19:07.441
then I'm going to go there.

319
00:19:07.441 --> 00:19:10.260
I don't care if it didn't work out so well for that guy,

320
00:19:10.261 --> 00:19:14.490
I'm going to go down that path.
You know,
I follow my instincts and my excitement.

321
00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:19.650
<v 2>It's such a fascinating way to pursue a goal in life,
you know,</v>

322
00:19:19.651 --> 00:19:23.580
to pursue a goal of becoming a champion,
mixed martial arts fighter.

323
00:19:23.910 --> 00:19:28.910
There's so few people that you can kind of like figure out how to do it from.

324
00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:33.420
Maybe it's like best that you have this mentality.
Just figure out yourself.

325
00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:37.260
<v 0>You can't fear,
you can't let fear into your life,
you know,</v>

326
00:19:37.261 --> 00:19:40.110
or else it's just going to take over and you know,

327
00:19:40.111 --> 00:19:43.470
just because this guy hurt his knee and was out for three years,

328
00:19:43.471 --> 00:19:48.210
it shouldn't stop me from going and fighting for what I want.
Right.

329
00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:51.660
Maybe you could be,
you could take some precautions but,

330
00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:54.720
and do things a little bit smarter.
But

331
00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:59.760
<v 2>no.
When you say things like you can't let fear into your life or into your mind,</v>

332
00:20:00.030 --> 00:20:03.340
do you actively try to block that out?
Is this

333
00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:08.370
<v 0>something that you work on?
Yeah,
I would say so.
Yeah.
It's like,</v>

334
00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:12.420
I guess the best example is,
is just going into a fight.

335
00:20:13.290 --> 00:20:18.090
Like you see some guys are terrified and it works for them,
like George.
Right,

336
00:20:18.091 --> 00:20:22.800
right,
right.
But I'm not scared at all.
Like,
I'm nervous.

337
00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:26.190
I definitely have nerves.
I'm not going to lie about that,
you know,

338
00:20:26.191 --> 00:20:28.890
and the anticipation of it.
And I think it's natural to just,

339
00:20:28.891 --> 00:20:31.490
your body just knows what it's about to go do.
But I,

340
00:20:31.491 --> 00:20:33.240
I'm not going to fear what I'm about to do.

341
00:20:33.241 --> 00:20:36.000
I'm going to take it head on and I'm going to conquer it.

342
00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:41.140
So when George would fight,
he would have like some serious nerves.
Yeah.

343
00:20:41.141 --> 00:20:42.860
He's terrified.
So buddy,

344
00:20:43.850 --> 00:20:47.830
what's crazy when you think he's the best welterweight ever?
Yeah.
Yeah.

345
00:20:47.831 --> 00:20:50.860
It's crazy.
Like all week before his fight,

346
00:20:50.890 --> 00:20:54.040
he just won't stop talking about how scared he is real.
It's just,

347
00:20:54.041 --> 00:20:58.150
it's really funny actually.
But why does he dwell on it?
I don't know.
It's just,

348
00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:02.200
it's just how he prepares for fights.
And it's interesting.
I don't,

349
00:21:02.201 --> 00:21:04.600
I don't relate to it at all.

350
00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:10.370
<v 2>He's a fascinating guy because he'll tell everyone what his fears are,</v>

351
00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:12.230
tell everyone what his weaknesses are.

352
00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:17.320
It's almost like he's setting himself up to half to overcome those things.

353
00:21:18.130 --> 00:21:21.200
<v 0>Yeah,
I,
yeah.
I don't know why he does that</v>

354
00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:23.590
<v 2>cause he performed so well.
I mean he has all,</v>

355
00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:28.420
it's like traditionally like if you would tell someone like what's the best

356
00:21:28.421 --> 00:21:31.450
thing to concentrate on concert on positive things,
focusing on the positive,

357
00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:34.930
but then you look at George and the achievements that he's been able to,

358
00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:40.270
to make and you know,
he's the greatest welterweight of all time.

359
00:21:40.370 --> 00:21:44.120
<v 0>Yeah.
Andy.
Andy has it that much more impressive that he,</v>

360
00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:47.540
you know,
he has all these fears and then he overcomes them.

361
00:21:47.541 --> 00:21:51.140
He forces himself to push through that.
Anyway.
What's interesting,

362
00:21:51.330 --> 00:21:51.660
<v 2>well,</v>

363
00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:55.260
what's interesting with George is just a couple different versions of George

364
00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:58.230
does.
It's like the play it safe.
George does it try to,

365
00:21:58.231 --> 00:22:02.280
when George and then there's a Georgia fought Bj Penn that was legitimately

366
00:22:02.281 --> 00:22:04.980
fucking pissed off like,
you know what I mean?

367
00:22:05.010 --> 00:22:09.120
Like when he fought Matt Serra the second time.
Yeah,
legitimately pissed off.

368
00:22:09.450 --> 00:22:13.980
But I think like Matt Serra as a person didn't bother him as much.
Bj Did.

369
00:22:14.310 --> 00:22:16.530
Bj got under his skin.
Like,

370
00:22:16.531 --> 00:22:20.010
I remember like when Bj was cell telling them that he was going to be fighting

371
00:22:20.011 --> 00:22:22.770
to the death and you know,
you could see George is like,

372
00:22:22.771 --> 00:22:26.790
you mother fucker talking all this crazy shit.
Like,
you know,
calling him,

373
00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:30.990
I can't help it.
Some of that stuff like bug you.
Right.
Yeah.

374
00:22:30.991 --> 00:22:34.500
But it seemed like that was like one of his most impressive performances.

375
00:22:34.501 --> 00:22:36.150
Like he wasn't just trying to win that fight.

376
00:22:36.151 --> 00:22:38.850
He was trying to beat the fuck outta be saying.
Yeah.
You know what I mean?

377
00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:41.370
It was like a different thing.
Yeah.

378
00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:46.500
<v 0>But it also has to do,
I think with the skill level of your opponent.
Um,</v>

379
00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:51.930
Eh,
and the style of fight that the way the fights going,
you know,

380
00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:55.800
I don't think Georgia intentionally tries to play it safe.

381
00:22:56.390 --> 00:23:01.390
He's constantly fighting the best guy in the world for 10 years in a row.

382
00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:04.350
Cause he's the champ,
right?
So it's the guy,

383
00:23:04.410 --> 00:23:08.220
the next guy at his best peaking for this,
the moment,

384
00:23:08.250 --> 00:23:10.410
the most important moment in his martial arts career.

385
00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:14.760
He's got to fight that guy for 10 years or however long he held that belt in a

386
00:23:14.761 --> 00:23:18.330
row.
People don't really take that into equation.
You know?

387
00:23:18.380 --> 00:23:21.870
He's always got to be the best in the world,
you know?

388
00:23:21.950 --> 00:23:24.260
<v 2>Yeah.
People always say that like,
oh,
he hasn't finished anybody.
Look,</v>

389
00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:26.270
look at the fucking people.
He's fighting it

390
00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:28.260
<v 0>and not just that they're at their best.</v>

391
00:23:28.890 --> 00:23:32.760
They're not just training for another fight is the moment.
Yeah.

392
00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:37.020
So it's quite impressive and I think people forget about that sometimes

393
00:23:37.150 --> 00:23:40.870
<v 2>it is.
And you know what is,
what was equally impressive was that he had the,</v>

394
00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:47.060
the awareness to step away.
Just say,
you know what,
I just need to take a break.

395
00:23:47.110 --> 00:23:47.811
Yeah.
You know,

396
00:23:47.811 --> 00:23:51.860
and there's been talk about him returning and I know he's starting to train

397
00:23:51.861 --> 00:23:55.310
again and he's training and enjoying it and he's not making any decisions.

398
00:23:55.311 --> 00:23:58.880
But I appreciate the fact that with all the money that's on the line,

399
00:23:58.881 --> 00:24:03.500
all the money that he could potentially be earning all the pressure to get him

400
00:24:03.501 --> 00:24:07.520
to fight again,
that he had the presence of mind to go,
you know,
on,

401
00:24:07.521 --> 00:24:08.390
let me just step back.

402
00:24:08.730 --> 00:24:10.050
<v 0>Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

403
00:24:10.051 --> 00:24:14.610
I think it's just part of knowing yourself and I think it's important.

404
00:24:14.611 --> 00:24:18.390
Like the guy has no life.
If you got,
if you seeing how this guy trains,

405
00:24:18.391 --> 00:24:23.130
you'd be blown away.
I'd never met anyone who trains that are really,

406
00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:25.290
yeah.
He's like,
he's got OCD.

407
00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:28.290
So it's like everything has to be perfect.

408
00:24:28.830 --> 00:24:33.420
And this training is like,
he can't miss a day,

409
00:24:33.421 --> 00:24:37.110
even if he's exhausted or you know,
he's feeling like shit.

410
00:24:37.111 --> 00:24:41.070
Like the guy's just a workhorse is what it takes.
Right.

411
00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:43.650
It's for some guys,
for me,
not so much.
No.

412
00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:47.070
I tried doing that and it just didn't work for me.
That's interesting.

413
00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:51.300
<v 2>Yeah.
So you,
you have your own protocol like you just saw.</v>

414
00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:55.450
<v 0>Yeah,
I go with how I'm feeling.
I think after Metamorris,
uh,
you know,</v>

415
00:24:55.451 --> 00:24:58.930
I've been here for a couple of days now and I could have went training,

416
00:24:58.931 --> 00:25:03.880
but I felt like crap,
I'm solar,
my arm,
see as though I'm chilling.

417
00:25:04.330 --> 00:25:08.620
And then tomorrow I'll probably,
I'll go train cause there'll be,
I'll be into it,

418
00:25:08.621 --> 00:25:12.520
you know,
and then
I'll be excited to train,
you know,

419
00:25:12.521 --> 00:25:15.490
and I'll get the most out of that training session.
I'll be aware,

420
00:25:15.491 --> 00:25:18.520
I'll be listening to the guys around me and I'll be,
and I'll be,

421
00:25:18.730 --> 00:25:22.540
I'll take as much as I can out of that training session and feel good about it.

422
00:25:22.810 --> 00:25:24.820
And for me personally,

423
00:25:24.821 --> 00:25:29.740
I feel like my skills increase more that way when I go to the gym,
like,

424
00:25:30.340 --> 00:25:35.320
like a strict two d two a days,
you know,

425
00:25:35.410 --> 00:25:40.030
every single day my body breaks down and I'm at the training session on my,
uh,

426
00:25:40.031 --> 00:25:43.120
I don't care about what anyone says,
you know,

427
00:25:43.121 --> 00:25:46.030
I'm just getting through it rather than taking part in it.

428
00:25:46.490 --> 00:25:46.821
<v 2>You know,</v>

429
00:25:46.821 --> 00:25:51.620
I've had conversations with many trainers about this and one of the things that

430
00:25:51.650 --> 00:25:53.420
a lot of people were in agreement,
um,

431
00:25:53.990 --> 00:25:58.990
is that there is an unrealistic expectation about what your body can go through

432
00:25:59.031 --> 00:26:01.880
that may be based on a lot of guys who use drugs.

433
00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:04.940
A lot of guys who use performance enhancing drugs like this guys who will tell

434
00:26:04.941 --> 00:26:09.580
you their training three times a day,
seven days a week,
and if you're doing that,

435
00:26:09.581 --> 00:26:12.410
if they aren't doing that,
they have to be taken some shit.

436
00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:15.850
<v 0>I have no idea how anyone could,
like my body</v>

437
00:26:17.350 --> 00:26:22.060
is dying,
you know,
after a half a week at training once a day,

438
00:26:22.210 --> 00:26:26.470
you know,
I don't know how these guys do that,
man.
It's,

439
00:26:26.471 --> 00:26:30.100
it blows my mind.
I just,
I just stay away from it.

440
00:26:30.250 --> 00:26:34.300
<v 2>Well,
the demands of MMA are so different than any other sport because you're</v>

441
00:26:34.301 --> 00:26:38.770
essentially learning three major sports.
You know,
you're learning,

442
00:26:38.771 --> 00:26:40.600
striking,
you'll learn and kickboxing,

443
00:26:40.601 --> 00:26:44.100
you learning wrestling and you're learning Jujitsu.
I mean there's three

444
00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:48.570
<v 3>of them together and you're incorporating them with strategy and different</v>

445
00:26:48.571 --> 00:26:53.100
positions.
That's fucking crazy combinations.
I look at John Jones.
He can,
yeah.

446
00:26:53.790 --> 00:26:57.130
He so he's like an artist though thing,
you know?
Yes.
Yeah.

447
00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:03.000
Intertwining them too is it's like an art of its own.
Yeah.

448
00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:08.420
It's such a all encompassing sort of a competition,

449
00:27:09.090 --> 00:27:12.540
which is why a guy like George with OCD,

450
00:27:12.541 --> 00:27:17.190
a guy who just is training constantly and relentlessly is white cells in the US

451
00:27:17.191 --> 00:27:21.480
because he can ramp it up to a point where a lot of people just can't keep up

452
00:27:21.481 --> 00:27:26.220
with them.
It works for him.
Yeah.
It works for him.
Did you try,

453
00:27:26.221 --> 00:27:31.020
when you first start came to Tristar seven years ago,
you were a guy who,

454
00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:35.180
I mean how old he now 2025.
So you were fucking God damn.

455
00:27:35.181 --> 00:27:39.780
Day 18 you were 18 when he came to Tristar and so you were doing well,
you were,

456
00:27:39.781 --> 00:27:41.940
you know,
you were starting to,
uh,

457
00:27:42.090 --> 00:27:45.180
to fight and you're starting to excel and your techniques,

458
00:27:45.181 --> 00:27:49.750
you just realized I need to go to where the best gym in the country is.

459
00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:54.960
I had come down there to visit,
uh,
when I wasn't fighting or you know,

460
00:27:54.961 --> 00:27:59.250
just to get a weekend of training with the guys and just see what another Jim

461
00:27:59.251 --> 00:28:03.360
was like cause I've only been at one gym train with those people.
Right.

462
00:28:03.361 --> 00:28:07.050
So I wanted to explore martial arts a little bit and uh,

463
00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:11.580
the amount of talent there and the technical approach there,

464
00:28:12.030 --> 00:28:16.110
I felt that I couldn't really excel with that.
Yeah.

465
00:28:16.111 --> 00:28:17.040
For Rasa Hobby,

466
00:28:17.041 --> 00:28:19.770
I was hoping that he was going to be able to make it in here but he's got some

467
00:28:19.771 --> 00:28:24.630
family obligations.
Just had a daughter.
I love that dude.
Yeah.
Fascinating guy.

468
00:28:25.110 --> 00:28:27.840
And one of the best coaches like he's got,

469
00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:31.920
the one thing that drives me crazy is when I listened to coaches in between

470
00:28:31.921 --> 00:28:35.040
rounds and they just say nonsense.
Like you got to get after him.

471
00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:40.080
He got to knock them out.
Like get out of there one,
one,
a BJ's fights.

472
00:28:40.110 --> 00:28:42.990
There was like,
you got to get them Bj do at Hilo style or something.

473
00:28:42.991 --> 00:28:44.970
Like they were saying like some crazy shit.
I was like,

474
00:28:44.971 --> 00:28:48.600
does he have anybody in there that can give him some fucking technical advice?

475
00:28:48.601 --> 00:28:52.140
Yeah,
that's crazy.
Tell him what is going wrong.
Step off to the left.

476
00:28:52.141 --> 00:28:56.310
You know it do change levels.
Do something you gotta you gotta give him some,

477
00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:59.070
I understand that approach in some situations.

478
00:28:59.071 --> 00:29:02.610
If the guy's just sleeping and he's just not willing to work,

479
00:29:02.670 --> 00:29:05.850
you got to wake him up.
But for me,

480
00:29:05.910 --> 00:29:10.820
I need someone to give me the technical advice cause I'm in there fighting,

481
00:29:10.830 --> 00:29:15.300
trying to figure this puzzle out.
You know,
and,
and fraudsters and John,

482
00:29:15.301 --> 00:29:19.860
Donna her do a really excellent job with giving me those,

483
00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:22.430
those pieces of the puzzle.
Right?
Yeah.
Donna,

484
00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:26.880
hers a another guy and unheralded brilliant guy.
Love talking to that guy.
Yeah,

485
00:29:27.540 --> 00:29:30.210
he's a smart guy.
He was a guy that I want,
I'm talking to,

486
00:29:30.340 --> 00:29:33.670
I worked out with George once we worked out on spinning back kick technique.

487
00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:38.160
I seen that doing it through Donna her because don hurt came to me and he said

488
00:29:38.161 --> 00:29:42.040
he's was like,
I need to find someone who,
uh,
has a in,
you know,
we

489
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:44.650
<v 2>wind up talking about spinning back kick technique and then I worked out with</v>

490
00:29:44.651 --> 00:29:44.951
George,

491
00:29:44.951 --> 00:29:49.951
but you talked to John and he's just this weird quiet encyclopedia of

492
00:29:50.321 --> 00:29:55.270
information when it comes to martial arts.
He's got a very,
yeah,

493
00:29:55.340 --> 00:29:59.080
it's,
yeah.
He's an incredible guy.
He's a brilliant dude.
Yeah.
Really.

494
00:29:59.081 --> 00:30:02.140
Unheralded I don't think people in the business understand.

495
00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:06.360
<v 0>Yeah.
He's not into it for the media or the attention at all.
He's just,</v>

496
00:30:06.570 --> 00:30:07.560
he's so,

497
00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:13.460
he has such a deep passion for martial arts and finding out how to beat another

498
00:30:14.431 --> 00:30:19.230
person.
It's just genius.
I heard a skill level on the mat and is incredible too.

499
00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:20.020
Yeah.
The,

500
00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:24.900
and the way he teaches to like things he's coming up with just so cutting edge

501
00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:26.333
wouldn't mind.

502
00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:30.330
<v 2>That's,
that's a big part of success in MMA,
isn't it?</v>

503
00:30:30.450 --> 00:30:35.400
Surrounding herself with great training partners and having minds like that.

504
00:30:35.610 --> 00:30:38.250
<v 0>Coaches,
yeah.
You need for a coach,</v>

505
00:30:38.251 --> 00:30:42.060
you need someone just as dedicated on the other side of the fence as you are

506
00:30:42.450 --> 00:30:46.710
doing the physical work.
You know,
cause you know you need,

507
00:30:46.740 --> 00:30:51.100
you need that skill.
You need to be able to,
to take what,

508
00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:55.380
take the skill from them and put it into your physical training.

509
00:30:55.680 --> 00:31:00.060
<v 2>Right?
Yeah.
That's what Duane Ludwig brought to team Alpha male.</v>

510
00:31:00.061 --> 00:31:02.680
And you see like what a massive impact.
That's how,
yeah.

511
00:31:03.090 --> 00:31:07.770
Cause he's just as crazy about coaching as those guys are about fighting.

512
00:31:08.010 --> 00:31:09.090
I mean,
if you ever meet Dwayne,

513
00:31:09.091 --> 00:31:13.010
he's got just notebooks and fucking stacks of shit that he's,
you know,

514
00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:16.650
into and he's constantly revising his routine,

515
00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:21.420
the routines and the drills that he runs guys through and sizing things up.

516
00:31:21.421 --> 00:31:26.421
Like when Tj Dillashaw beat Hanan Barao I had lunch with Ludwig that day.

517
00:31:27.420 --> 00:31:32.130
Uh,
and Dwayne,
Dwayne,
you ever talked to Dwayne?
He's a maniac.

518
00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:33.560
I could talk to him.
He was talking a million miles.

519
00:31:33.561 --> 00:31:34.740
Now it's just kind of doing a little one.

520
00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:37.020
He's like one of those dudes and he was like,
what can I do?

521
00:31:37.021 --> 00:31:37.980
He's got to step off to the left.

522
00:31:37.981 --> 00:31:40.110
You got to make sure that when when brow a taxi,

523
00:31:40.111 --> 00:31:42.900
a taxi over committed see stays flat foot.
He does this with Tj is going to do,

524
00:31:42.901 --> 00:31:47.901
is going to do a lot of things and it's just this red line and constantly and he

525
00:31:48.511 --> 00:31:53.130
essentially blueprinted exactly what was going to happen in the fight.

526
00:31:53.430 --> 00:31:57.030
He explained to me exactly what's going to happen in the fight and Tj and him.

527
00:31:57.031 --> 00:32:01.020
How such a close relationship that it was just one of those situations where the

528
00:32:01.021 --> 00:32:05.760
Co,
the right coach met the right student and the student is a sponge and he just

529
00:32:05.761 --> 00:32:07.650
listens to everything Dwayne says.

530
00:32:08.250 --> 00:32:10.950
You know what's really funny about it is we were talking about this during one

531
00:32:10.951 --> 00:32:14.040
of the fight podcasts is that,
you know,

532
00:32:14.041 --> 00:32:18.440
who doesn't fight the way Duane teachers,
Dwayne,

533
00:32:20.220 --> 00:32:23.440
he never fall like that.
He's not like captain footwork,

534
00:32:24.610 --> 00:32:29.000
no precision puncher,
precision puncher,

535
00:32:29.010 --> 00:32:33.930
precision kicker,
excellent Moy Tai,
but he wasn't that like crazy footwork dude.

536
00:32:34.010 --> 00:32:38.940
Too much.
Too much.
It's weird,
but he teaches TJ and it's perfect.

537
00:32:38.941 --> 00:32:43.850
It's almost like do as I say,
not as I do,
or maybe his body didn't work that way,

538
00:32:43.851 --> 00:32:46.730
or maybe he didn't need to or he had a different approach.

539
00:32:46.980 --> 00:32:50.070
<v 0>Right.
But he's doing good work out there.</v>

540
00:32:50.140 --> 00:32:52.210
<v 2>Yeah,
he really is.
I'm amazed.
I mean,</v>

541
00:32:52.211 --> 00:32:56.890
it's one of the things that's most exciting to me about MMA is the differences

542
00:32:56.891 --> 00:33:01.891
in approach as far as like different coaches and the results because nobody

543
00:33:02.081 --> 00:33:06.460
really knows exactly what the right way to do it is.
And it's different for you.

544
00:33:06.490 --> 00:33:08.320
You said as it is for George,

545
00:33:08.590 --> 00:33:11.890
it's probably different for Tj than it is for like Joseph Benevidez.

546
00:33:11.891 --> 00:33:15.080
Like everybody has their own approach and it's,

547
00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:19.810
it's just a matter of figuring it all out and working it all out.

548
00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:24.880
And there's so many variables.
It's just an endlessly fascinating to me.

549
00:33:25.490 --> 00:33:29.480
<v 0>It is.
Yeah.
It's,
it's crazy.
There's so many new guys too.</v>

550
00:33:29.481 --> 00:33:32.570
It's so exciting right now.
Yeah.

551
00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:36.260
That meant a new talent coming out and,
and,
and the new,
uh,

552
00:33:37.180 --> 00:33:39.260
like you look at Ronda Rousey,
Conor Mcgregor,

553
00:33:39.261 --> 00:33:43.670
these guys are so different from what we've seen like five years ago.
It's great.

554
00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:45.420
No,
no one was using judo throw.

555
00:33:45.421 --> 00:33:48.960
It was like Rhonda is no one's crazy or hectoring my,
yeah,

556
00:33:49.970 --> 00:33:54.100
<v 2>act.
It has very little Lombard versus Jake shields was a judo exhibition.
Yeah.</v>

557
00:33:54.101 --> 00:33:56.980
That was pretty crazy.
That was a dominant name fight.
And he's,

558
00:33:57.190 --> 00:34:00.970
he's a motherfucker now when you see a guy like Lombard and you see a fight like

559
00:34:00.971 --> 00:34:03.160
that with Jake shields,
does that get you excited about fighting him?

560
00:34:03.290 --> 00:34:06.090
<v 0>Yeah.
Yeah.
I can tell.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He's a,</v>

561
00:34:06.091 --> 00:34:09.620
he's going to be fun to fight for sure.
I'm excitable.
Fighting him.

562
00:34:10.170 --> 00:34:12.300
<v 2>And you were excited about fight and Tyron Woodley,</v>

563
00:34:12.330 --> 00:34:14.910
who's a another powerful explosive guy.

564
00:34:14.990 --> 00:34:19.920
<v 0>Powerful guy.
You know,
I felt like,
uh,
my technique had overcome,
you know,</v>

565
00:34:20.090 --> 00:34:24.020
his physical,
uh,
you know,
obviously you look at me and he look at him,

566
00:34:24.650 --> 00:34:28.460
he's physically superior,
you know,
like he's an athlete.

567
00:34:28.461 --> 00:34:32.600
Like just cut it out of stone.
And I felt like it was exciting for me to see,

568
00:34:33.170 --> 00:34:33.351
you know,

569
00:34:33.351 --> 00:34:37.460
all the skill that I've skill work I've done over the years to overcome a
bigger,

570
00:34:37.461 --> 00:34:41.960
stronger,
faster opponent.
You know,
cause I was never that guy.
I,
I'm athletic guy,

571
00:34:42.590 --> 00:34:47.530
but when I started martial arts,
I was a,
I was a little Puke,
you know,

572
00:34:47.570 --> 00:34:51.620
I got beat up by bigger kids are,
you know,
so it's kind of,

573
00:34:51.621 --> 00:34:53.150
it was a cool thing for me,

574
00:34:53.151 --> 00:34:57.310
especially being in Vancouver to fight a guy like that and uh,

575
00:34:57.350 --> 00:35:02.150
use my skill to like,
you know,
solve this puzzle of the bigger,

576
00:35:02.151 --> 00:35:03.230
faster,
stronger guy.

577
00:35:03.370 --> 00:35:06.050
<v 2>No,
that was a beautiful fine.
It was a beautiful fight that was a fight there.</v>

578
00:35:06.051 --> 00:35:09.970
You really kind of shut him down,
you know,
in a weird way.
Like he didn't,

579
00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:13.090
he didn't really didn't have an answer.
I didn't know what to do.
Yeah,
he was,

580
00:35:13.210 --> 00:35:16.360
he was waiting for a certain certain thing.
Yeah.

581
00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:21.130
And I also love how you use that high elbow to block the right hand.

582
00:35:21.250 --> 00:35:23.110
That's a,
that's,
that's interesting.

583
00:35:23.111 --> 00:35:26.560
And that's a little use technique is that for us?

584
00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:28.080
<v 0>Yep.
Um,</v>

585
00:35:28.470 --> 00:35:33.470
the Philly show was used in the olden days when gloves were around,

586
00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:38.520
um,
for,
uh,
blocking headshots,
um,

587
00:35:39.210 --> 00:35:42.820
because the bigger gloves now in,
and you can just go like this and right.

588
00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:46.740
You put your hands up.
But now with our gloves or no gloves,

589
00:35:47.850 --> 00:35:52.320
this doesn't really stop anything.
It still hurts like hell.

590
00:35:52.590 --> 00:35:55.610
Your temple is exposed a lot.
Your,

591
00:35:55.740 --> 00:35:59.880
your jaw line back here is exposed a lot of these little a your fist can fit

592
00:35:59.881 --> 00:36:03.360
through these little spaces now because there's not a huge pillow,

593
00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:08.550
a huge pillar but a bigger pillar to absorb that,
that impact.

594
00:36:08.970 --> 00:36:10.260
So they,

595
00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:14.610
they started using the Phillies show and using elbows and forearms and,

596
00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:19.800
and your,
your tricep to,
to,
to fill in those holes against uh,

597
00:36:19.830 --> 00:36:24.510
you know,
just bare knuckle.
So I,
I felt that it would be useful to me.

598
00:36:25.020 --> 00:36:25.261
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

599
00:36:25.261 --> 00:36:28.800
It's interesting when you go back and you look at like old school boxing matches

600
00:36:28.801 --> 00:36:32.700
when they had the little tiny gloves I go look at someone like the Jack Dempsey

601
00:36:32.701 --> 00:36:36.480
fights.
Like they were,
they were fighting with almost like a little bag gloves.

602
00:36:36.540 --> 00:36:40.530
Yeah they just had like leather all over their hands.
Yeah.

603
00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:44.180
But which is very similar to MMA gloves.
Yes,
I know.

604
00:36:44.490 --> 00:36:46.650
What do you think about no gloves?

605
00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:50.040
<v 0>I like it.
Do you like that better?
Yeah,</v>

606
00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:51.890
<v 2>I think about that all the time.
Cause I'm like,</v>

607
00:36:51.891 --> 00:36:56.210
why is it okay to Shin kick a guy in the head?
Why is it okay to Nia guy,

608
00:36:56.211 --> 00:36:58.790
the head or elbow,
but you have to protect your knuckles.

609
00:36:58.970 --> 00:37:03.470
Like is that some leftover hold out stuff from box and it could be the idea that

610
00:37:03.471 --> 00:37:04.410
you need pants.
Yeah.

611
00:37:04.570 --> 00:37:08.490
<v 0>And maybe just for the media to write,</v>

612
00:37:08.590 --> 00:37:13.530
we need to have rounds.
We need to have uh,
rules and,

613
00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:13.781
and,

614
00:37:13.781 --> 00:37:18.340
and gloves and some kind of protection so that the mainstream media can accept

615
00:37:18.341 --> 00:37:22.750
it as a sport.
But yeah,
the raw UFC first,

616
00:37:22.751 --> 00:37:26.080
the first fights,
you know,
that's,
that's,
that was the real deal.

617
00:37:26.370 --> 00:37:29.070
<v 2>But it seems contradictory to me because how come you like,</v>

618
00:37:29.340 --> 00:37:33.220
like a Edson Barboza Terry Adam Lowry wheel kicks him in the head and some of

619
00:37:33.230 --> 00:37:36.690
his heel.
I mean,
that is the hardest part of your body.

620
00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:38.550
You're walking around on it all the time.

621
00:37:38.551 --> 00:37:42.690
You could take your heel and walk up to a wall and dump the wall.
Yeah.

622
00:37:42.750 --> 00:37:43.830
Anybody could do that.
Well,

623
00:37:43.831 --> 00:37:45.630
you could take a little kid and I get stomped the wall,

624
00:37:45.810 --> 00:37:48.720
take a little kid and tell him to go punch the wall.
Yeah.
It'll hurt.

625
00:37:48.721 --> 00:37:51.220
Like it hurts everybody.
Like you can't do it.
Yeah.

626
00:37:51.390 --> 00:37:55.710
And it seems to me that it's very unrealistic to wrap up the hands,

627
00:37:55.830 --> 00:38:00.090
tape up the risks because that's an issue as well.
The,
the,
the risks move,

628
00:38:00.330 --> 00:38:00.691
you know,

629
00:38:00.691 --> 00:38:04.920
and you have this unrealistic expectation of how you could just sort of tee off

630
00:38:04.921 --> 00:38:07.350
on people and,
and brawl with them.

631
00:38:07.650 --> 00:38:09.960
Whereas if it was just bare knuckle,

632
00:38:10.050 --> 00:38:13.140
you'd be forced to be much more precise with your punches and be much more

633
00:38:13.141 --> 00:38:15.390
realistic in the,
in the impact of them.

634
00:38:16.310 --> 00:38:20.510
<v 0>I think it,
I think our gloves to aren't helpful for the situation.</v>

635
00:38:20.511 --> 00:38:25.130
I think the UFC loaves could get a little bit better.
In what way?
Um,

636
00:38:25.670 --> 00:38:30.020
they're kind of like round and so they make your hand open up.
Uh,

637
00:38:30.380 --> 00:38:32.660
right.
You're always talking about Ipos.

638
00:38:33.290 --> 00:38:36.130
The glove is a big reason for right,
in my opinion.

639
00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:39.580
<v 3>Yeah.
Um,
have you tried to bell tore gloves?
No,</v>

640
00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:42.610
the bell time I tried the old pride gloves.
They were awesome.

641
00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:45.290
You like those better?
Yeah,
we used to have those laying around here somewhere.

642
00:38:45.291 --> 00:38:46.270
I would probably have in the back,

643
00:38:46.990 --> 00:38:50.170
the old pride gloves have more of a curve to them and if you've watched the old

644
00:38:50.171 --> 00:38:54.330
price does make a fist and keep your fist and very rare that you saw I pokes,

645
00:38:55.120 --> 00:39:00.010
you know,
they um,
Bella tour is using some Everlast gloves that do two things.

646
00:39:00.011 --> 00:39:03.280
One,
it curves the fist more,
keeps the fist closed more.

647
00:39:03.281 --> 00:39:07.620
And another thing is it reinforces the,
uh,
the metacarpal.
Okay.

648
00:39:07.990 --> 00:39:12.580
Reinforce.
It's more padding in here where it's preventing handbrakes.

649
00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:16.930
Right.
Which it makes it thicker,
which makes it harder to choke people,

650
00:39:17.170 --> 00:39:21.340
which probably not good.
I think like especially for Jujitsu and grappling,

651
00:39:21.580 --> 00:39:26.510
I think it would definitely benefit people if there was no gloves.
Okay.

652
00:39:26.850 --> 00:39:28.400
Yeah.
It might even stop the,

653
00:39:28.410 --> 00:39:32.500
I polks more if there was no gloves because your hand wouldn't automatically

654
00:39:32.501 --> 00:39:36.340
open up.
Yup.
I agree with that.
Yeah.

655
00:39:36.341 --> 00:39:41.020
I don't know if people are willing to,
I don't think so.
Not,
not,

656
00:39:41.050 --> 00:39:45.280
not in the mainstream media and no,
I don't think so.

657
00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:47.800
But how crazy is that though?
Cause you could smash it.

658
00:39:47.801 --> 00:39:51.250
You get on top of a guy and you could literally smash his eyeball open with your

659
00:39:51.251 --> 00:39:56.000
elbow.
Yeah.
It's just like,
I think it's people's predisposition.
Like they're,

660
00:39:56.020 --> 00:39:59.310
they're,
you know,
they need to see that glove,
whatever.

661
00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:03.880
Even though every other part of your body that's used as a weapon in the MMA

662
00:40:03.881 --> 00:40:08.840
world is the protective Ashlyn is harder.
Shins and knees,
you know,

663
00:40:08.841 --> 00:40:13.210
I mean like God,
you know?
Yeah.
Elbows are a big,

664
00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:18.520
you know,
they cut you.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Do you think that elbows,
she,

665
00:40:18.521 --> 00:40:20.870
there's another argument that elbow shouldn't be allowed,

666
00:40:20.871 --> 00:40:22.570
like the Strikeforce rules.
They have to,

667
00:40:22.850 --> 00:40:27.700
they have to be alone because they're effective.
Yeah.
Yeah.
What about,

668
00:40:27.790 --> 00:40:32.410
I mean,
I think headbutts and knees on the ground need to be involved to really,

669
00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:36.270
yeah,
I would like to see that.
Yeah.
Right.
Like welcome.

670
00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:37.240
You can punch a guy in the head,

671
00:40:37.241 --> 00:40:41.830
but you can like smash them with your head like it is a legitimate weapon would

672
00:40:41.831 --> 00:40:45.250
change with knees on the ground to the head and head butts.

673
00:40:45.251 --> 00:40:49.450
It would change the dynamic of ground fighting.
What about soccer kicks?
Yeah,

674
00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:51.940
that too.
But what about soccer kicks being a problem?

675
00:40:51.941 --> 00:40:53.770
Because guys get pinned up against the cage.

676
00:40:53.771 --> 00:40:55.060
That's the only argument that I've ever heard.

677
00:40:55.061 --> 00:40:58.420
That makes a lot of sense to me that they shouldn't be legal because you can get

678
00:40:58.421 --> 00:41:02.200
your head stuck.
Yeah.
But the fight would be over pretty quick.

679
00:41:04.570 --> 00:41:07.700
So the idea is just don't get stuck.
Yeah.
Don't get there.

680
00:41:08.830 --> 00:41:13.090
Pay The price.
Pay The price.
I wonder if any organization could ever,

681
00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:15.850
if anybody would do it,
it would be Japan.
You know,

682
00:41:16.210 --> 00:41:20.950
Japan would take it to who's good one.
Fcs got some good rules.
Yeah.
Yeah.

683
00:41:21.310 --> 00:41:23.770
Well they have a weird rule where they allow you,

684
00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:27.430
like they say open fight or something like that where they allow the referee's

685
00:41:27.431 --> 00:41:31.480
discretion.
They have to time it or something.
Yeah.
That's weird.
Yeah.

686
00:41:31.750 --> 00:41:34.490
And there's been to where it got awkward.

687
00:41:35.350 --> 00:41:38.450
<v 2>Yeah.
Yeah.
I don't know about all that.
Yeah.
That's a bit weird.</v>

688
00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:41.780
I don't know about the referee deciding cause what have you get an idiot
referee,

689
00:41:41.990 --> 00:41:44.210
you know?
That does happen.
A lot of those,

690
00:41:45.590 --> 00:41:49.340
there's some times where guys are battling for position and it's like a very

691
00:41:49.341 --> 00:41:53.600
important transition in a fight and the referee will like be like yelling at

692
00:41:53.601 --> 00:41:57.260
them.
Like,
come on guys,
you gotta work,
you gotta work.
Like what are you watching?

693
00:41:57.350 --> 00:42:01.010
You not watching a fight.
These guys are fighting and in my opinion,

694
00:42:01.011 --> 00:42:04.190
like as long as guys aren't actively stalling,

695
00:42:04.220 --> 00:42:08.180
as long as they really are trying to get to a better position where you're

696
00:42:08.181 --> 00:42:13.150
watching is an important part of grappling.
That's why I'm against standups.
Yeah,

697
00:42:13.170 --> 00:42:17.580
me too.
Good.
That's awesome.
Yeah,
I think it's like just play out.

698
00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:22.350
Yeah.
That's where the note,
that's where the no,
no rounds and no time of them.

699
00:42:22.350 --> 00:42:27.020
It also plays a big part in a fight to,
yeah,
it should,

700
00:42:27.021 --> 00:42:28.210
but you know,
I,

701
00:42:28.211 --> 00:42:31.250
I kind of understand the idea of rounds is that it makes it more exciting and

702
00:42:31.251 --> 00:42:35.610
guys get to recover in between rounds.
They don't seem so exhausted,
but the,

703
00:42:36.180 --> 00:42:40.200
if you're going to have rounds that I'm really against standups.
Yeah.

704
00:42:40.310 --> 00:42:43.400
If a guy could take you down to molest you for five rounds and just hold you in

705
00:42:43.401 --> 00:42:47.830
place and,
and beat on you,
Ben and her in style.
That's life.
Yeah.

706
00:42:47.930 --> 00:42:49.970
You got to learn how to deal with that.
You gotta yeah.

707
00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:55.010
The tech technical skill to be able to get out of that situation.
Yeah.

708
00:42:55.011 --> 00:42:55.451
And ask her,

709
00:42:55.451 --> 00:42:58.850
and I was Kinda bummed out when he signed with one fc because I was like,

710
00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:03.230
I want to see what that guy couldn't do in the UFC against elite guys.

711
00:43:03.710 --> 00:43:08.660
Like when he fought Douglas Lema in uh,
in Beltour.
I was like,
Holy Shit.

712
00:43:08.661 --> 00:43:10.160
Like he could do that to that guy.

713
00:43:10.460 --> 00:43:14.190
Like Lima's a bad mother fucker and he's pretty good fucking rag doll and I'm

714
00:43:14.191 --> 00:43:18.390
going to ask her is so goddamn good at wrestling.
Yeah.
You know,
he's good.

715
00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:23.660
It's important to have guys like that around.
Yeah.
You know it,
I think maybe,

716
00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:29.800
maybe UFC is worried about him beating the exciting guys and then having a

717
00:43:29.811 --> 00:43:33.920
boring guy around because no one likes to watch him.
Maybe I do.

718
00:43:34.030 --> 00:43:38.510
It's a fan friendly.
Yes.
But who knows if he would,
you know,

719
00:43:38.511 --> 00:43:42.110
you've got to take a cheek setting part.
Yeah.
My thought on it,

720
00:43:42.111 --> 00:43:46.730
I'm a purist in my thought on it is you don't know who the best in the world is

721
00:43:46.731 --> 00:43:50.090
until you take the guys who are the most dangerous or in his case,

722
00:43:50.091 --> 00:43:53.420
the most problematic.
And you got to pick them up against each other.

723
00:43:53.630 --> 00:43:56.240
And unless you do,
it's not legit.
Yeah.

724
00:43:56.241 --> 00:43:59.410
It'd be nice to see him in the EOC to see if he is,
you know,

725
00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:01.880
a top contender for real.
Yeah.
I mean,

726
00:44:01.940 --> 00:44:05.240
or you put them in there with a guy like you who could shut them down and you

727
00:44:05.241 --> 00:44:08.050
say,
oh,
okay,
well here's his issue.
You know,
you know,

728
00:44:08.230 --> 00:44:12.080
we've seen it time and time again.
We just saw with Eddie Alvarez,
Eddie Alvarez,

729
00:44:12.081 --> 00:44:15.710
who look great and Beltour Donald Cerrone just picks his leg apart and you go,

730
00:44:15.711 --> 00:44:20.420
oh,
okay,
well here's this is the new level.
You hit the next level.
Yeah.
You see?

731
00:44:20.450 --> 00:44:25.100
Yeah.
You see a guy's from other organizations that come in,
they start to see,

732
00:44:25.670 --> 00:44:28.910
maybe they're not so invincible in,
we'll look at Hector Lombard when,

733
00:44:28.940 --> 00:44:32.130
when he was fighting a one 85 in Beltour,
he was rushing.

734
00:44:32.130 --> 00:44:35.780
People came over to the UFC.
Tim Boetsch beats him and you know,

735
00:44:35.790 --> 00:44:38.280
10 bucks is a very good fighter.
No,
no doubt about it.

736
00:44:38.281 --> 00:44:43.281
But what the issue was is Bosch is a natural two oh five cuts down to one 85 and

737
00:44:43.591 --> 00:44:48.591
lombards and one 70 who's a little blown up to be one 85 and the skill level and

738
00:44:49.021 --> 00:44:53.100
the toughness of Boesch allowed him to beat him.
And that's,
you know,

739
00:44:53.101 --> 00:44:56.400
everybody was saying like Walmart's going to come over and smash everybody and

740
00:44:56.401 --> 00:45:00.270
he's looks really good now at one 70 but that's,
that's important.

741
00:45:00.271 --> 00:45:04.950
You got to see that play out.
Yeah.
And if it doesn't play out,
I feel like,

742
00:45:04.951 --> 00:45:07.650
I feel like I got robbed.
Like I feel,
I really do.

743
00:45:07.651 --> 00:45:10.740
Like when astron sign with one FC,
I remember reading it online.
I was like,

744
00:45:10.741 --> 00:45:14.610
what that fun.
You get a fight over there.
I was upset.

745
00:45:14.850 --> 00:45:19.850
I mean maybe he maybe in a year or two years the talent level of one FC will

746
00:45:20.581 --> 00:45:24.840
rise to the occasion or you know,
maybe he'll go over to bell a tour,
who,

747
00:45:24.841 --> 00:45:28.320
who the fuck knows may or maybe come back rather the ballots or who the fuck

748
00:45:28.321 --> 00:45:33.240
knows,
you know now the cokers there and Bjorn has gone,
you know,
who knows.

749
00:45:33.241 --> 00:45:36.330
Maybe that was the issue that the reason why he left and maybe

750
00:45:38.100 --> 00:45:40.390
it'd be nice to see him in the EOC.
I,

751
00:45:40.580 --> 00:45:44.070
it'd be nice to see another organization really fucking step up and be like,

752
00:45:44.071 --> 00:45:48.440
pride was to like be like the other competition would be good for the fighters.

753
00:45:48.600 --> 00:45:53.070
Good for everybody.
Right.
And it's good for everybody in weight classes too.

754
00:45:53.071 --> 00:45:54.900
Like a weight class like yours welterweight.

755
00:45:54.901 --> 00:45:59.901
I mean you got a fucking murderers row at welterweight and that's important and

756
00:46:00.601 --> 00:46:02.010
that's why you know,

757
00:46:02.110 --> 00:46:05.860
all these new guys are coming up and that they're at a very high level and like

758
00:46:05.910 --> 00:46:09.990
it seems like whenever you have a really super ultra competitive weight class,

759
00:46:10.410 --> 00:46:14.370
it's all these people start rising to the occasion and you see better

760
00:46:14.371 --> 00:46:19.170
performances from all of them.
Yeah,
yeah.
The welterweight division.
It's crazy,

761
00:46:19.171 --> 00:46:24.030
man.
It's like so unstable.
You never know who's going to come out on top.

762
00:46:24.031 --> 00:46:28.470
It's like a pressure cooker.
But I think,
I think it,
I think I'm going to,

763
00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:29.993
you know,

764
00:46:30.090 --> 00:46:33.180
I'm coming up right now and I think I might be able to dominate the division

765
00:46:33.181 --> 00:46:35.420
soon.
Well you're definitely getting better.
You know,

766
00:46:35.450 --> 00:46:37.590
that's one of the things getting in the opportunity.

767
00:46:37.591 --> 00:46:40.020
I'm fighting for the title next,
so I guess we'll see.
Yeah,

768
00:46:40.021 --> 00:46:40.810
you're fighting against,

769
00:46:40.810 --> 00:46:44.010
[inaudible] was a big eye opener for a lot of people cause saffron and is known

770
00:46:44.011 --> 00:46:48.120
as a standup guy and you set traps for him,
man.
You know,
that was a,

771
00:46:48.121 --> 00:46:49.920
that was a really interesting fight.
You know,

772
00:46:50.310 --> 00:46:54.600
there's small details going on in that.
Yeah.
That was a big victory.
You know,

773
00:46:54.601 --> 00:46:57.900
catching him like that and stopping him like that.
That was a big victory.

774
00:46:57.901 --> 00:47:01.290
The Damien Maia fight was a big victory.
That was probably my favorite fight.

775
00:47:01.370 --> 00:47:04.320
Yeah,
because he got you down that first round when he's most dangerous,

776
00:47:04.590 --> 00:47:09.220
both dry and you know,
it got you down,
be defended perfectly,
you know,

777
00:47:09.300 --> 00:47:13.170
and then he's a tough guy and not a lot of people recognize him in the

778
00:47:13.171 --> 00:47:17.440
welterweight division right now.
We so strong,
so strong at texts.

779
00:47:18.390 --> 00:47:22.470
Crazy and getting down to one 70 you see him very tactical,

780
00:47:22.471 --> 00:47:26.480
but also like physically strong,
like the Rick story fight.
Yeah.
You know,

781
00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:30.550
no one's ever taken story down like that and he's crushed.
It crushes John Fitch.

782
00:47:30.970 --> 00:47:35.400
<v 3>No one ran through Fitch like that at the time.
He,
John Fitch,
Fitch.
I know,
right?</v>

783
00:47:35.610 --> 00:47:36.443
Yeah,
it's true.

784
00:47:36.460 --> 00:47:40.510
I mean that's what fits would do to guys out grapple them and beat them down.

785
00:47:40.570 --> 00:47:44.920
Yeah.
That's another issue that I wanted to bring up his weight cutting.

786
00:47:45.490 --> 00:47:50.070
That's that sort of highlights.
Why like weight cutting?
Fuck.
It's,

787
00:47:50.110 --> 00:47:54.190
it's unfortunate,
but it's reality.
How much do you cut?

788
00:47:54.940 --> 00:47:59.620
Um,
well right now about 200 Jesus Christ sign.
Yeah.

789
00:47:59.621 --> 00:48:04.560
But I'm not like jacked Tall Guy Hotel six two,

790
00:48:04.690 --> 00:48:06.040
six one six,
six foot.

791
00:48:07.300 --> 00:48:10.220
And I added an inch too for some reason that was about,

792
00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:16.150
so it's not too hard for me actually.
I just diet.

793
00:48:16.250 --> 00:48:19.450
So two months normally naturally weigh 200 pounds.

794
00:48:19.840 --> 00:48:24.000
And then the week of the fight,
how much do you weigh?
Uh,

795
00:48:24.580 --> 00:48:29.580
like before the fight I'll be 82 one a two.

796
00:48:30.671 --> 00:48:33.340
So you lose somehow or another 18 pounds along the way.

797
00:48:33.370 --> 00:48:36.430
And how are you doing that?
Is Diet man healthy eating,

798
00:48:37.240 --> 00:48:39.590
but you're not a lot of extra stuff.
I would never imagine that.

799
00:48:40.250 --> 00:48:43.750
I am not like I'm not ripped all year round.
I'm only,

800
00:48:43.930 --> 00:48:46.690
I'm only really kite when I'm cutting weight from my fight.

801
00:48:47.560 --> 00:48:49.720
I have a lot of extra excess weight,

802
00:48:49.750 --> 00:48:52.150
I guess water weight or whatever you want to call it.

803
00:48:52.330 --> 00:48:55.290
Do you watch your diet all year round or when you don't have a fight you fuck

804
00:48:55.291 --> 00:48:58.870
her off?
Pretty much.
I like to eat kind of healthy.
But yeah,

805
00:48:58.871 --> 00:49:03.250
I definitely go off.
Yeah.
What do you think about guys who,
well,

806
00:49:03.251 --> 00:49:06.220
you're pretty extreme weight cutter then.
I mean that's,
that's not really though,

807
00:49:06.221 --> 00:49:09.670
cause it's not hard for me.
No,
no,
it's,
it's really not.

808
00:49:09.800 --> 00:49:12.280
Like if you asked my coaches,
like I'm just cruising,

809
00:49:12.820 --> 00:49:15.810
well one 82 the week of is not bad,
you know?
Yeah.

810
00:49:15.900 --> 00:49:19.960
That's it down there 12 he comfortable and then it's just like I don't eat too

811
00:49:19.961 --> 00:49:21.280
much and you know,

812
00:49:21.310 --> 00:49:26.310
I managed my water levels properly and I am exercising and I have a good system.

813
00:49:26.440 --> 00:49:29.080
It works for me.
That is another issue though.

814
00:49:29.081 --> 00:49:31.660
That goes along with training for a fight,

815
00:49:31.661 --> 00:49:36.160
the issue of dehydrating yourself essentially and getting down to 170 pounds for

816
00:49:36.161 --> 00:49:39.430
a brief amount of time.
And then when you step into the octagon,

817
00:49:39.431 --> 00:49:43.060
what do you weigh and pull on a five so not bad.

818
00:49:43.240 --> 00:49:46.570
So you're not straining yourself too much.
You don't deplete your body too much.

819
00:49:46.600 --> 00:49:50.110
I feel good.
I'm a lot of the times I feel like I could fight when I,

820
00:49:50.250 --> 00:49:53.500
when I would get on the scale.
Really.
Yeah.
I really don't feel bad at all.

821
00:49:53.890 --> 00:49:57.730
That's nice to hear because there are some guys that push it so far.
Yeah,

822
00:49:57.760 --> 00:50:01.870
I've had that in the past,
like,
well I just do like,
I just cut water,

823
00:50:02.500 --> 00:50:05.350
but now I die at the white off naturally and I feel great.

824
00:50:07.300 --> 00:50:11.320
So it was just a matter of like being a bit more disciplined in your camp.
Yeah.

825
00:50:12.530 --> 00:50:16.300
Nutrition's a big part of it and yeah,
I use,
um,

826
00:50:16.540 --> 00:50:20.230
do you know George Lockhart is?
No.
Uh,
he's a nutritionist,

827
00:50:20.231 --> 00:50:24.880
a x fighter and uh,
yeah,
he's got a good system.

828
00:50:25.530 --> 00:50:27.130
Um,
I think his website,

829
00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:32.240
<v 2>a fitness VT,
so he's one of those dolce type dudes.</v>

830
00:50:32.740 --> 00:50:36.080
He,
I think he's a bit different than dolce.
In what way?

831
00:50:36.840 --> 00:50:38.780
There's a lot of marketing machine.
No,

832
00:50:39.020 --> 00:50:42.530
and I think he's just a little more natural,
a little more natural.

833
00:50:42.531 --> 00:50:47.310
Xd is trying to say,
dude,
I dunno.

834
00:50:47.330 --> 00:50:51.800
I've just heard things
you're talking about like diuretics.

835
00:50:52.040 --> 00:50:54.830
I don't know what they're doing over there,
but uh,
it's not for me.

836
00:50:55.010 --> 00:50:59.660
Well that was Bj's accusation.
Yeah,
the diuretics thing.
Yeah.
I Dunno.
I don't,

837
00:50:59.661 --> 00:51:01.580
I don't,
I don't like to play with any of that.

838
00:51:01.581 --> 00:51:04.670
I like to keep it natural and I have a healthy

839
00:51:06.470 --> 00:51:08.660
nutrient rich body,
you know,

840
00:51:09.670 --> 00:51:11.480
let my skill did the work for me.

841
00:51:11.540 --> 00:51:14.090
Well apparently you can use diuretics that are natural though.

842
00:51:14.140 --> 00:51:18.650
Or a vitamin C in high doses is apparently a natural diuretic.
That's what a,

843
00:51:18.660 --> 00:51:21.380
they say dolce uses.
Okay.
One of the things that he does,

844
00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:25.130
I have no idea what a system is.
I don't know either,

845
00:51:25.310 --> 00:51:29.890
but a lot of guys have been popped for diuretics in the past and none adult

846
00:51:29.900 --> 00:51:33.110
chairs guys have.
Okay.
So I don't know if Woody's,
do you mean there's,
there's,

847
00:51:33.710 --> 00:51:37.920
it's like performance enhancing drugs are performance enhancing substances.
It's,

848
00:51:37.921 --> 00:51:38.430
it's a fun,

849
00:51:38.430 --> 00:51:43.430
such a strange thing because there are nutrients that you can isolate in levels

850
00:51:45.111 --> 00:51:47.750
that you would normally never get in food.
You know,

851
00:51:47.751 --> 00:51:50.960
you can take nutrients and I that are healthy and normal,

852
00:51:51.140 --> 00:51:52.670
but you extract them from food,

853
00:51:52.671 --> 00:51:56.750
you take them in pill form and they can without a doubt improve your
performance.

854
00:51:56.780 --> 00:51:57.613
Okay.

855
00:51:58.370 --> 00:52:02.150
But those are illegal because they're essentially food based supplements,

856
00:52:03.110 --> 00:52:07.580
vitamins and nutrients,
vitamins,
nutrients,
not natural thing,
concepts,

857
00:52:07.581 --> 00:52:12.560
mushrooms,
things along those lines.
Optum,
it allows you,

858
00:52:12.561 --> 00:52:15.810
the Chinese Olympic team used it and we actually have some here.
I'll,

859
00:52:15.811 --> 00:52:19.280
I'll give you something before it's totally safe.
It's called shroom tech.

860
00:52:19.281 --> 00:52:20.450
You've ever heard of shroom tech sport.

861
00:52:21.080 --> 00:52:24.710
It allows your body to better utilize oxygen.

862
00:52:24.711 --> 00:52:29.420
It actually came from high altitude hurting populations had found that their

863
00:52:29.421 --> 00:52:34.421
cows were eating these mushrooms that were growing and they were more active.

864
00:52:35.290 --> 00:52:37.550
And so that was a initially how it was discovered.

865
00:52:37.730 --> 00:52:42.200
They actually grow it on caterpillars.
That's really kind of fucking freaky.
Yeah.

866
00:52:42.201 --> 00:52:45.620
But so these,
this is a natural,
natural,

867
00:52:45.650 --> 00:52:50.300
natural nutrition.
Exactly.
Nutrients and things that,
you know,
it's,

868
00:52:50.301 --> 00:52:53.810
this isn't like EPL or something.
Exactly.
Yeah,
exactly.
Yeah.

869
00:52:53.840 --> 00:52:57.980
If it is natural and you know,
it's,
I think that's,

870
00:52:58.010 --> 00:53:01.430
that should be allowed,
right?
Yeah.
But then you get things like creatine,

871
00:53:01.730 --> 00:53:03.380
which was also behind the natural,

872
00:53:03.381 --> 00:53:07.540
but you're taking it in forms where you would never get it from meat beneficial

873
00:53:07.550 --> 00:53:10.340
to a fighter though.
15 no,
there's been studies,

874
00:53:10.341 --> 00:53:13.100
there's been studies that say the creatine improves.
So physical strength,

875
00:53:13.240 --> 00:53:16.400
but there's also been studies that show it makes you retain water,

876
00:53:16.401 --> 00:53:18.200
which is one of the last things that a fighter would want,

877
00:53:18.201 --> 00:53:19.700
especially when you were about to cut weight.

878
00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:23.340
I don't really take too many supplements that are not really educated are all

879
00:53:23.430 --> 00:53:26.460
right too much.
I take the protein and like bcas

880
00:53:26.550 --> 00:53:30.210
<v 0>and stuff.
What kind of protein do you use?
Do use plant based or a,
yeah,</v>

881
00:53:30.211 --> 00:53:34.920
he's Vega and that's good stuff.
Definitely in the past.
Yeah.
Dudes way,

882
00:53:34.980 --> 00:53:38.050
way approaching it wrong.
No,
no,
just mostly plant based.
Yeah,
I'm,

883
00:53:38.230 --> 00:53:40.470
and you know what,
I don't do it all the time.
I just,

884
00:53:40.830 --> 00:53:42.600
I kinda use it once in a while.

885
00:53:43.140 --> 00:53:46.350
So this should probably use more supplements.

886
00:53:46.351 --> 00:53:50.820
I think eating good really helps me a lot.
I drink a lot of water.

887
00:53:51.840 --> 00:53:56.310
Do you drink your,
you're,
you have a coffee?
Their coffee.
I like coffee.

888
00:53:56.460 --> 00:53:59.900
Do you fuck around with that?
Like the week of the fights?
You know,

889
00:54:00.040 --> 00:54:02.660
it doesn't seem to mess with you.
It doesn't bother me.
Yeah.

890
00:54:02.670 --> 00:54:05.010
Tito Ortiz used to say that coffee fucks with your cardio,

891
00:54:05.011 --> 00:54:08.340
but I've never heard that before.
The fact of her helps.

892
00:54:08.970 --> 00:54:12.450
I haven't had a problem with it.
I just have a coffee a day usually.

893
00:54:12.540 --> 00:54:15.870
What does this nutrition guy again,
what's his name?
George Lockhart.
Lockhart.

894
00:54:16.020 --> 00:54:19.770
And does he propose or prescribed meals for you?
Does he like,

895
00:54:20.220 --> 00:54:23.270
he'll have like a meal plan and stuff and like,
um,

896
00:54:23.510 --> 00:54:28.290
he'll help balance it for your work schedule.
Like,

897
00:54:28.291 --> 00:54:32.250
uh,
he,
he does it for like regular people and then like,
you know,

898
00:54:32.280 --> 00:54:36.300
athletes and fighters and stuff.
So you can punch in like your workout schedule.

899
00:54:36.660 --> 00:54:39.300
Uh,
it's detailed,
like how much you walking that day,

900
00:54:39.301 --> 00:54:42.630
how much you're sitting down,
how much you're sleeping.
Um,

901
00:54:42.960 --> 00:54:47.610
all kinds of stuff like that.
And uh,
how much body fat you are,
how tall you are,

902
00:54:47.790 --> 00:54:48.990
what your goals are.

903
00:54:49.230 --> 00:54:54.150
So it's a whole like system he has in place.
So he's very specific.

904
00:54:54.180 --> 00:54:57.750
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
This guy knows his stuff.
If you ever talk to them,
it's just like,

905
00:54:58.830 --> 00:55:02.430
like 90% of the things just go right over your head cause he just like,

906
00:55:02.640 --> 00:55:06.420
he's using words that you've never heard of and he's talking fast and he's a

907
00:55:06.421 --> 00:55:07.254
smart guy.

908
00:55:07.380 --> 00:55:11.820
He's one of those dudes you have to ask him like three times the same question

909
00:55:11.940 --> 00:55:14.700
to like kind of feel a little bit like,
you know what he's talking about.

910
00:55:15.420 --> 00:55:19.310
So do you um,
just get a plan from him or does he actually cut,

911
00:55:19.350 --> 00:55:24.080
make the meals for just like the pine.
So you do all the preparation,

912
00:55:24.100 --> 00:55:28.110
everything yourself,
all your own shopping,
stuff like that.
You Cook for yourself,

913
00:55:28.111 --> 00:55:32.940
all that child?
Yeah.
Oh Wow.
Yeah.
And when it comes to PR portions,

914
00:55:32.941 --> 00:55:37.380
do you measure them out?
Yeah,
I,
I've kind of like figured it out now.

915
00:55:37.381 --> 00:55:41.460
Like just kind of general size.
But when I first started,
yeah,

916
00:55:41.461 --> 00:55:46.140
it was like wait and stuff.
Now what about like green leafy vegetables,

917
00:55:46.141 --> 00:55:51.030
things along those lines to see if it wasn't strong on that?
Yeah,
yeah,
for sure.

918
00:55:51.120 --> 00:55:55.370
All types of different vegetables.
It's mostly vegetables.
I guess.
And what,

919
00:55:55.371 --> 00:55:56.820
what is what source of protein?

920
00:55:57.600 --> 00:56:01.850
There's nuts for like snacks and stuff and then,
you know,

921
00:56:02.100 --> 00:56:06.920
chicken breasts,
certain fish like salmon,
um,

922
00:56:07.980 --> 00:56:11.940
flaming,
you know,
um,
pork tenderloin.

923
00:56:12.120 --> 00:56:16.040
There's a few different ones.
So essentially mostly low fat type stuff.
Yeah.

924
00:56:16.260 --> 00:56:19.990
And do you get your fats from like avocado or coconut oil or avocado oil?

925
00:56:19.991 --> 00:56:24.790
Coconut oil is another one.
There's the nuts,
again,
almonds and stuff,

926
00:56:24.850 --> 00:56:25.683
walnuts.

927
00:56:25.900 --> 00:56:28.810
<v 2>That's very interesting to me as well that this is something that people</v>

928
00:56:28.820 --> 00:56:33.820
realizing within the last few decade or so that like healthy fats or just as

929
00:56:34.031 --> 00:56:36.820
important as nutrients is a very important part of your diet.

930
00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:39.430
A lot of energy concern,
right?
If you take that stuff out,

931
00:56:39.431 --> 00:56:42.520
your brain's fucking dries up.
When I've,

932
00:56:42.530 --> 00:56:46.450
I've tried like taking fats out of my diet like way back in the day after I

933
00:56:46.451 --> 00:56:49.990
experimented with different diets and one of the things that I've found is I got

934
00:56:49.991 --> 00:56:54.820
stupid,
like my brain wasn't working as well.
Like I could feel the difference.

935
00:56:54.870 --> 00:56:57.100
Yeah.
You need to like oil your brain.

936
00:56:59.290 --> 00:57:04.070
I don't know what the exact mechanism is,
but as flaxseed oil to fish oils,

937
00:57:04.071 --> 00:57:04.880
stuff like that.

938
00:57:04.880 --> 00:57:09.280
And take tablet fish oil or do you like us tablespoons?

939
00:57:09.940 --> 00:57:13.270
Like liquid?
Yeah.
Yeah.
The liquid stuff's a little bit easier to digest.

940
00:57:13.271 --> 00:57:16.930
You don't have to deal with that.
Um,
the gelatin that comes from the outside,

941
00:57:16.931 --> 00:57:21.440
which is essentially just the animal hooves and shit like that.
They turn into,

942
00:57:21.790 --> 00:57:25.930
I take vitamins,
Gel capsules and vitamins.
I don't,

943
00:57:26.020 --> 00:57:26.880
I haven't had a problem with.

944
00:57:26.920 --> 00:57:30.170
And does this Guy George C measure all this stuff out for you as well?
And um,

945
00:57:30.850 --> 00:57:34.540
yeah,
it's,
it's all like portion dote on the site for you.

946
00:57:34.660 --> 00:57:35.860
Do you get blood work done?

947
00:57:36.700 --> 00:57:40.020
<v 0>Um,
I haven't,
I,
I,
I've,
uh,</v>

948
00:57:40.720 --> 00:57:43.210
I've got prescription to like measure like all,

949
00:57:43.211 --> 00:57:46.480
like my nutrient levels and I've just been too lazy to go get it done.

950
00:57:48.820 --> 00:57:49.750
That's ridiculous though.

951
00:57:49.751 --> 00:57:52.960
Your professional bio at the highest level of the game and I'm,

952
00:57:54.130 --> 00:57:57.940
I'm an idiot.
No,
I don't know.
It's just,
I just,

953
00:57:57.941 --> 00:58:00.880
I'm a procrastinator with it because,
you know,

954
00:58:00.881 --> 00:58:05.080
one day I'll feel like crappy and I'll be talking to my osteopath and it'd be

955
00:58:05.081 --> 00:58:08.500
like,
go get these blood work done,
see what your deficiencies are.

956
00:58:08.710 --> 00:58:13.060
So we'll get a prescription and I'll never go do it.
I'm scared of needles.

957
00:58:13.090 --> 00:58:16.960
It's a big thing.
Get the fuck Outta here.
I pass out.

958
00:58:19.660 --> 00:58:23.380
I'm not joking.
It's not scared to fight in a cage.
I passed.

959
00:58:23.381 --> 00:58:28.060
Don't many times doing like ivs or stuff like that.
Yeah,
man,

960
00:58:28.120 --> 00:58:32.950
I hate it.
I sold like when you're rehydrating like when they give you an ivy,

961
00:58:32.951 --> 00:58:35.320
you pass out.
Yeah.
Faint.

962
00:58:36.390 --> 00:58:38.200
Then I wake up and everyone's looking at it.

963
00:58:38.590 --> 00:58:42.760
I almost attacked for us and a couple of guys because I've woken up and didn't

964
00:58:42.761 --> 00:58:44.690
know where it was and I was just like,
wow,

965
00:58:47.400 --> 00:58:49.540
that's hilarious.
Yeah.
It sucks.

966
00:58:49.940 --> 00:58:53.000
<v 2>Date this girl who couldn't even watch someone get a needle in a movie,</v>

967
00:58:53.001 --> 00:58:53.834
she would black out.

968
00:58:53.910 --> 00:58:57.720
<v 0>Yeah.
Yeah.
If I think about it too hard,
then I'll like get like,</v>

969
00:58:57.721 --> 00:59:01.110
see my stomach will like,
that's so weird.
Yeah.

970
00:59:01.590 --> 00:59:04.440
But that's sort of a logical,
I don't understand what that is.

971
00:59:04.470 --> 00:59:07.770
And it only happened like it only started happening like four or five years ago.

972
00:59:07.970 --> 00:59:11.190
We were like blood like cause you have to get blood work done for the fights

973
00:59:11.191 --> 00:59:15.450
right past like your HIV and all that stuff.
And before I would just be like,

974
00:59:15.451 --> 00:59:20.040
yeah,
and it's done.
Walk away now.
Then all of a sudden out of nowhere,

975
00:59:20.670 --> 00:59:22.100
every I see a needle

976
00:59:22.100 --> 00:59:23.790
<v 2>coming my way,
I go,
my fee,</v>

977
00:59:23.870 --> 00:59:28.870
my face will get white and for no reason that's so strange.

978
00:59:28.881 --> 00:59:30.440
So I have to like get on my phone like this,

979
00:59:30.441 --> 00:59:35.441
I have to lay down like it's a whole person look away and distract myself.

980
00:59:36.080 --> 00:59:39.110
Wow.
Even talking about right now,
I like get like,

981
00:59:40.040 --> 00:59:43.490
that's so strange.
I mean it was,
it would make more sense.

982
00:59:43.491 --> 00:59:47.570
It was something you always had.
Yeah.
It's so weird.
Like my ex girlfriend,

983
00:59:47.690 --> 00:59:51.510
her dad had it and she said that her dad one time,
um,

984
00:59:52.130 --> 00:59:57.110
her brother got like a severe sunburn and the had blisters all over and the Dad

985
00:59:57.111 --> 01:00:00.830
saw it and the dad fainted.
And what's crazy is it dad was a fucking doctor.

986
01:00:00.831 --> 01:00:02.810
He was,
I was,
uh,
he was,
he was a dentist.

987
01:00:03.250 --> 01:00:05.570
So tell me how the fuck is this guy like me?

988
01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:10.300
Obviously it must deal with some fucked up shit and gory things in

989
01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:16.190
dentistry too.
Yeah.
Weird.
Well,
he,
I guess he was okay with needles,

990
01:00:16.340 --> 01:00:20.540
but he would see certain things like he saw his son with blisters,
just like

991
01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:28.040
blisters because you know,
like from the,
from the sun,
from the sunburn.

992
01:00:28.390 --> 01:00:32.060
And he apparently had a really bad sunburn.
Yes.
She was like,
it's weird.

993
01:00:32.090 --> 01:00:34.520
It's fucking weird,
right?
Yeah.
It's in her family I guess.

994
01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:39.410
But it's weird that you acquired it.
That's very nowhere.
It was just like one,

995
01:00:39.530 --> 01:00:39.891
it was,

996
01:00:39.891 --> 01:00:44.420
I was doing blood work for a fight and I was at the hospital and I was just like

997
01:00:44.421 --> 01:00:48.640
an everyday and then I passed out and ever since that it happens.

998
01:00:48.641 --> 01:00:51.830
So I have to be really careful.
That's fucking weird,
dude.
Yeah.

999
01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:56.240
If you've talked to a psychologist about that,
no,
no.
Probably never.
Well,

1000
01:00:58.730 --> 01:01:03.260
I would want to know if there's like a coping mechanism for that.
Yeah,

1001
01:01:04.330 --> 01:01:08.090
I,
I'll probably just overcome it.
Maybe now,

1002
01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:11.070
maybe now you'd be thinking about this conversation we're going to be bringing
in

1003
01:01:13.430 --> 01:01:18.290
sports psychology is a very interesting thing to me and I've actually thought

1004
01:01:18.291 --> 01:01:22.610
about using a sports psychologist for standup for standup company because I'm

1005
01:01:22.611 --> 01:01:25.580
like,
I don't think anybody's ever done that before.
Right.
I bet.

1006
01:01:25.790 --> 01:01:30.770
Because a lot of camps incorporate sports psychologist is a heavy part of their

1007
01:01:30.771 --> 01:01:35.540
regimen and like Ryan Parsons who uh,
you know,
he trains,
uh,

1008
01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:38.240
Dennis Bermudez and he handles a impact.
Comments,

1009
01:01:38.241 --> 01:01:42.090
a lot of good guys and he's big on that.
Yeah.
And uh,

1010
01:01:42.100 --> 01:01:44.750
I've always been fascinated by sports.
I'm not,

1011
01:01:44.751 --> 01:01:46.990
I've never actually sat now with a psychology.

1012
01:01:47.050 --> 01:01:51.080
I've gone over my own brain either vi,
I don't know what they would talk about.

1013
01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:56.540
Like what would,
what would they tell me?
I don't know to do differently for you.

1014
01:01:56.570 --> 01:02:00.070
They probably watched that video you staring and they'd be like,
they good,
good,

1015
01:02:00.130 --> 01:02:02.610
good,
good.
Whatever that is,

1016
01:02:02.690 --> 01:02:07.370
that place maybe to help you get to that zone,
right?
Yeah.
Well,

1017
01:02:07.371 --> 01:02:12.371
that's what I would wonder is for some guys it becomes necessary after a loss

1018
01:02:13.700 --> 01:02:18.050
because after a loss,
um,
you know,
there,
there are people that have,

1019
01:02:19.230 --> 01:02:23.970
I guess the best way to describe it would be unrealistic expectations or

1020
01:02:24.300 --> 01:02:26.610
unrealistic perceptions of who they are.

1021
01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:29.460
They like to think of themselves as being absolutely different from everybody

1022
01:02:29.461 --> 01:02:33.030
else.
And you know,
they're a champion.
It's going to happen.

1023
01:02:33.150 --> 01:02:35.820
They're going to beat everybody and then they get beat.
They're like,
fuck,

1024
01:02:35.821 --> 01:02:40.530
I can't believe I lost.
Like,
and it becomes a real issue.
Read,

1025
01:02:40.531 --> 01:02:42.660
structuring their mindset,

1026
01:02:42.661 --> 01:02:46.020
like re reestablishing their confidence.

1027
01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:51.780
<v 0>Yeah.
Interesting.
I don't jewelers use one,
I think.
Yeah.
A while.</v>

1028
01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:55.970
I don't think he always did it,
but I think he tried it.
David [inaudible],

1029
01:02:55.971 --> 01:02:56.950
who I think did it too

1030
01:02:57.210 --> 01:03:00.870
<v 2>well,
the wiser has some real problems.
Right?
Anxiety.
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

1031
01:03:01.740 --> 01:03:05.110
And he didn't have those until he lost,
he lost a retrained Clinton.

1032
01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:08.760
That's when all those kids that started it.
Yeah.
I'm not too sure.
I can't.
Well,

1033
01:03:08.860 --> 01:03:13.260
that was a brutal fight.
That was,
yeah,
that was a war.
Brutal file.
Yeah.

1034
01:03:13.261 --> 01:03:14.730
It was one of Rich's,
uh,

1035
01:03:14.790 --> 01:03:18.270
biggest victories and it was when rich was in his prime and it was just a

1036
01:03:18.570 --> 01:03:21.960
beating.
Yeah.
David was really never the same after that fight.

1037
01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:23.910
<v 0>Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

1038
01:03:24.420 --> 01:03:27.750
<v 2>When,
uh,
George used it was,
it was post the Matt Serra fight.</v>

1039
01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:31.240
<v 0>I have no idea when it was.
I never really asked him about it too much.</v>

1040
01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:35.280
<v 2>Well,
he seems like the type of guy that we try everything,
he's very open minded,</v>

1041
01:03:35.670 --> 01:03:36.090
you know?

1042
01:03:36.090 --> 01:03:39.720
<v 0>Yeah.
And if someone tells him something with Enough Confidence Hill,</v>

1043
01:03:39.750 --> 01:03:40.650
be interested in it.

1044
01:03:41.290 --> 01:03:42.250
<v 2>Well,
so I mean,</v>

1045
01:03:42.310 --> 01:03:45.400
I was amazed that he was willing to work out with me when I told them that I

1046
01:03:45.401 --> 01:03:48.160
could help them with a spinning back kick.
I'm so if I was like,
yeah,

1047
01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:51.940
let me get to you on that,
you know?
But he's very open.
He's very,
yeah.
Yeah.

1048
01:03:51.941 --> 01:03:56.020
As far as learning things healed,
he has this,
like,
I'll try anything.

1049
01:03:56.080 --> 01:03:59.680
He's got the beginner's mindset.
Yes.
Almost too much.
So,

1050
01:03:59.860 --> 01:04:04.660
because that's how we got roped into all that fucking witch doctor do rubbing on

1051
01:04:04.661 --> 01:04:08.570
his chest butoh moves and shit.
He's very like,
uh,

1052
01:04:08.620 --> 01:04:12.700
he's like a child almost in that sense,
you know?
Yeah.
Yeah.
He's,

1053
01:04:12.710 --> 01:04:16.480
he's very optimistic in that sense.
Like a summit there.

1054
01:04:16.550 --> 01:04:18.280
Everyone's always trying to help him and stuff,

1055
01:04:18.281 --> 01:04:22.000
but they were explaining to me what this guy was doing to him that he was like

1056
01:04:22.001 --> 01:04:25.240
changing his shockers in his Meridians and all this.
And I go,
Whoa,
Whoa,
whoa,

1057
01:04:25.241 --> 01:04:28.450
Whoa,
whoa.
Shit.
Yeah.
I was going,
what the fuck's going on?
I was like,

1058
01:04:28.451 --> 01:04:32.230
you're given this guy money.
Hold on.
Yeah.
Explain this again.

1059
01:04:32.950 --> 01:04:33.940
What the fuck are you saying?

1060
01:04:33.941 --> 01:04:38.260
Do you really think there's one guy that can do this and there's no one else in

1061
01:04:38.290 --> 01:04:42.550
the world of the Olympics,
elite athletes and football,

1062
01:04:42.730 --> 01:04:45.430
NBA boxing,
fill in the blank.

1063
01:04:45.490 --> 01:04:48.910
Millions and millions of fucking billions of dollars on the line and all these

1064
01:04:48.911 --> 01:04:50.740
sports.
Yeah.
And there's one dude,

1065
01:04:50.741 --> 01:04:53.490
he knows how to rub on your fucking chest and turn you into a sweat.

1066
01:04:53.510 --> 01:04:57.940
I heard this guy's,
this witch Dr. Guy.
I never met him.

1067
01:04:58.270 --> 01:05:01.330
I'm out of it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I never met her.
Um,

1068
01:05:01.360 --> 01:05:04.830
Dana was the one who actually called him the witch doctor and he,

1069
01:05:05.050 --> 01:05:09.290
he claimed that his his name after like Dana called them as a goof.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1070
01:05:09.310 --> 01:05:13.570
Like,
Oh you're like a witch doctor.
And then he was like,
yeah,
I'm a witch doctor.

1071
01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:18.020
Which doctor
fucking thing?
I don't

1072
01:05:18.020 --> 01:05:20.830
<v 3>know.
I don't know anything about the situation.
I wasn't around for it,</v>

1073
01:05:20.831 --> 01:05:25.831
but I'm always astounded the areas that elite high level Alpha male competitors

1074
01:05:27.131 --> 01:05:31.180
like fighters getting fucktard but bullshit.
I,

1075
01:05:31.181 --> 01:05:33.580
there's been a few guys looking for the advantage.
Right.

1076
01:05:34.170 --> 01:05:38.860
Looking for the next thing.
They're really,
I think it's,
it's,
it's in your head.

1077
01:05:39.010 --> 01:05:40.070
Oh no doubt.

1078
01:05:40.090 --> 01:05:44.080
And one guy I talked to actually admitted to me that what he was doing was all

1079
01:05:44.081 --> 01:05:47.100
in your head.
I keep trying to,
like everybody was telling me like,
you know,

1080
01:05:47.110 --> 01:05:50.320
I've always had neck and back problems just from Jujitsu and this guy was

1081
01:05:50.321 --> 01:05:53.710
working on me and he was like doing some weird shit where he like pressing the

1082
01:05:53.711 --> 01:05:54.610
back of my head.

1083
01:05:55.030 --> 01:05:58.000
He's like telling me that he could tell like where my issues were by pressing

1084
01:05:58.001 --> 01:06:00.440
the back of my head and be like,
does this hurt?
And I was just hurt.

1085
01:06:00.500 --> 01:06:04.090
And then he'd be like,
press one spot harder.
It was like,
does that hurt?
I go,

1086
01:06:04.091 --> 01:06:05.050
well you just pressed it harder.

1087
01:06:05.770 --> 01:06:09.100
And like we had this little like we're looking at each other funny and then I
go,

1088
01:06:09.101 --> 01:06:11.350
what exactly you do it?
And we got into like,
you know,

1089
01:06:11.380 --> 01:06:14.740
he tried to like get me his spiel and okay,
let's try this again.

1090
01:06:14.770 --> 01:06:15.880
What exactly you're doing.

1091
01:06:15.910 --> 01:06:19.370
Like what exactly are you doing and what is essentially he was saying,
yeah,

1092
01:06:19.840 --> 01:06:23.470
in a round about sort of a way was that if you believe in what he's doing,

1093
01:06:23.650 --> 01:06:26.980
then it becomes like a placebo effect.
Placebo.
But I'm like,

1094
01:06:26.981 --> 01:06:31.180
but you can't just bullshit me.
You can't bullshit me because I'm too curious.

1095
01:06:31.300 --> 01:06:32.051
If you bullshit me,

1096
01:06:32.051 --> 01:06:34.870
I'm going to ask questions and I need to know whether or not I'm being

1097
01:06:34.871 --> 01:06:38.920
bullshitted.
But it's kind of fucked because if I just let him bullshit me,

1098
01:06:39.100 --> 01:06:44.060
maybe I would've had a better result.
But I was,
you know,
I was just like,

1099
01:06:44.230 --> 01:06:48.970
fighters like to see these guys.
You see this all the time.

1100
01:06:49.120 --> 01:06:53.290
Like with those little plastic wristband with the shiny little tape on it,

1101
01:06:55.890 --> 01:07:00.190
like that's going to help me be a better athlete.
Fucking Mike Goldberg.
Michael,

1102
01:07:00.910 --> 01:07:05.320
one time we were in Vegas and he had a couple of drinks and he's telling me how

1103
01:07:05.321 --> 01:07:06.490
amazing these he's wearing,

1104
01:07:06.491 --> 01:07:10.060
what he's fucking stupid things in his room and he's telling me how amazing it

1105
01:07:10.061 --> 01:07:10.930
is and makes,

1106
01:07:10.990 --> 01:07:14.800
he introduces me to these guys that are selling them and they try to do these

1107
01:07:14.801 --> 01:07:18.370
carnival tricks on you.
Yeah,
yeah.
I know,
I know what you're talking about.

1108
01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:22.210
They do different little tests with your body,
like pushed down one arm,

1109
01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:27.640
but if you understand your Jitsu,
you know he's changing the leverage points.

1110
01:07:28.060 --> 01:07:31.750
Like he's like,
he's like doing it like this and then like you know,

1111
01:07:31.751 --> 01:07:34.900
he'll like go further out in your arm.
Like now try and you're like,

1112
01:07:34.901 --> 01:07:36.940
well you're over there now.
Get the fuck over here.

1113
01:07:37.390 --> 01:07:42.010
Do it the way you did it first.
You know,
it's like,
okay,
now resist me.
Okay,

1114
01:07:42.011 --> 01:07:44.590
now resist me.
Some people,
oh man,
dude,

1115
01:07:44.700 --> 01:07:49.700
Shane had one on Vandelay had one on Caren woman was telling me how it helped us

1116
01:07:49.991 --> 01:07:52.720
back.
Mike oversee my back's ever been better.

1117
01:07:52.780 --> 01:07:57.580
Two years later you fucking just dissed fused course.
Fuck you talking about man,

1118
01:07:57.581 --> 01:08:01.450
this guy's,
he's got a rubber band on your wrist with fucking shiny,

1119
01:08:01.480 --> 01:08:03.340
shiny plastic.
Yeah.

1120
01:08:03.341 --> 01:08:07.990
I guess maybe it's some people's human instinct to like look for that edge.

1121
01:08:08.290 --> 01:08:12.340
Yeah.
Look for that age.
I believe it and believe it and actually feel better.

1122
01:08:12.850 --> 01:08:16.010
Actually feel better.
Yeah.
It's crazy.
Yeah.
It's totally crazy.

1123
01:08:17.700 --> 01:08:22.220
<v 2>Yeah.
The mind is so powerful.
It's insane.
It's amazing.
It is amazing.</v>

1124
01:08:22.550 --> 01:08:27.400
Some People Power of belief is,
is a,
it's something to be said.
Well,

1125
01:08:27.420 --> 01:08:31.310
I was reading this thing where they were talking about injuries and that in

1126
01:08:31.311 --> 01:08:32.150
certain injuries,
you know,

1127
01:08:32.151 --> 01:08:35.000
people get atrophy after the injury because they don't use the muscle while it's

1128
01:08:35.001 --> 01:08:35.834
healing.
Right.

1129
01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:41.560
But if you spend x amount of time doing visualization exercises and x amount of

1130
01:08:42.741 --> 01:08:46.940
time visualizing actually using those specific muscle groups,
they don't atrophy.

1131
01:08:47.210 --> 01:08:51.200
Right.
Yeah.
I've,
I've heard of that.
What the fuck,
man.
Yeah.

1132
01:08:51.201 --> 01:08:52.550
You're your imagination.

1133
01:08:52.580 --> 01:08:56.180
I think about like all different kinds of things like that when I'm daydreaming

1134
01:08:56.181 --> 01:08:58.850
and I find it helps me.
Oh it must,

1135
01:08:59.210 --> 01:09:04.210
I mean mindset is so important and we think about the mind is the control panel

1136
01:09:04.611 --> 01:09:07.580
for the body.
That's what's executing all those moves.

1137
01:09:07.940 --> 01:09:12.680
And one of the things about you when it comes to competition that I think freaks

1138
01:09:12.681 --> 01:09:17.270
people out is how calm you stay and how,
how dead.

1139
01:09:17.270 --> 01:09:18.101
I'd like that.

1140
01:09:18.101 --> 01:09:22.430
That video where you're just standing there staring and not blinking like that

1141
01:09:22.790 --> 01:09:27.140
dead eyed calmness.
That's,
that's not giving into anxiety,

1142
01:09:27.141 --> 01:09:32.141
that's not having extraneous thought or need to bounce around and beat my chest

1143
01:09:33.741 --> 01:09:36.020
before the fight.
You know,
it just doesn't make a difference for me.

1144
01:09:36.590 --> 01:09:40.850
But some guys do.
Yeah.
It gets you hyped up.
Yeah.

1145
01:09:41.750 --> 01:09:45.140
Yeah.
I don't need to get hyped up,
but like when you think about it,

1146
01:09:45.141 --> 01:09:48.980
like the one guy that everybody was so impressed with for throughout his career

1147
01:09:48.990 --> 01:09:52.430
was fate or cause he just dead faced to yeah.

1148
01:09:52.610 --> 01:09:56.600
He just turns it on when the bell rings.
Yeah,
exactly.
It didn't need to.

1149
01:09:56.630 --> 01:10:00.680
And he used to say that like showing anger or showing emotion was a sign of

1150
01:10:00.681 --> 01:10:05.681
weakness and that you should be focused entirely on your task and nothing else.

1151
01:10:07.280 --> 01:10:09.860
I can agree with that.
But you don't have like,

1152
01:10:10.100 --> 01:10:15.100
this isn't something that you've like worked out with a coach or that you think

1153
01:10:15.291 --> 01:10:18.680
it's just experience over the years learning yourself.

1154
01:10:18.920 --> 01:10:21.320
Is it from observing other people that are also good at it?

1155
01:10:22.340 --> 01:10:26.510
I think it's self experience and yeah,
maybe.
I Dunno.

1156
01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:28.820
I Dunno why it happened and all of a sudden

1157
01:10:30.760 --> 01:10:34.770
just did it was just your thing.
Yeah.
It's just my thing.
You've found your game,

1158
01:10:34.771 --> 01:10:37.850
you gotta wash her.
Yeah.
You to go the bathroom.
Go ahead.

1159
01:10:38.050 --> 01:10:41.390
It's right through that door.
Okay.
Goddamn athletes and the small bladders.

1160
01:10:41.640 --> 01:10:46.190
So what happens though is drinking that water
right to the door,

1161
01:10:46.191 --> 01:10:49.310
right on your right hand side,
right there.
Uh,

1162
01:10:49.850 --> 01:10:53.630
Rory Macdonald,
ladies and gentlemen.
Uh,
during this intermission,

1163
01:10:53.631 --> 01:10:57.980
this brief intermission,
why a Roy does his PPS,
I would like to announce,

1164
01:10:58.790 --> 01:11:03.020
well,
actually the show tomorrow night at the Ice House is basically sold out.

1165
01:11:03.020 --> 01:11:06.860
I think it's sold out cause it's a ridiculous lineup.
It's Bill Burr,
crystally,

1166
01:11:06.870 --> 01:11:10.880
uh,
Brian Cowen,
Ian Edwards,
Tony Hinchcliffe and me.

1167
01:11:11.120 --> 01:11:13.320
I do it every year,
every year.

1168
01:11:13.321 --> 01:11:17.610
I do a night before Thanksgiving because I'm almost always home with my family

1169
01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:21.450
during thanksgiving.
Um,
we actually talked about going places to thanksgiving,

1170
01:11:21.451 --> 01:11:25.980
but that seems like a Goddamn nightmare place or nightmare time to travel.

1171
01:11:27.300 --> 01:11:30.870
But that shit is a basically sold out.
Um,

1172
01:11:30.930 --> 01:11:35.760
and then the next Gig I have to after that is December 12th on the road in

1173
01:11:35.761 --> 01:11:40.350
Phoenix,
Arizona with a Tony Hinchcliffe at the celebrity theater.

1174
01:11:40.580 --> 01:11:44.700
Uh,
everybody that tuned into a rocky mountain high that was on comedy central.

1175
01:11:45.210 --> 01:11:49.620
Thank you so much.
This was,
I think my best one.
I always say that,
but this one,

1176
01:11:49.621 --> 01:11:52.620
I really do think it was my best one and it was without a doubt the best

1177
01:11:52.621 --> 01:11:57.360
received one.
My last one was,
wasn't it?

1178
01:11:57.600 --> 01:12:02.190
I think I just wasn't doing as much stand up while I was doing it.
And um,

1179
01:12:02.370 --> 01:12:05.850
for whatever reason,
you know,
a lot of people didn't like it as much.

1180
01:12:06.120 --> 01:12:07.590
They felt like I fell off a little bit.

1181
01:12:07.591 --> 01:12:12.330
So I worked really hard on this one and uh,
it paid off.

1182
01:12:12.390 --> 01:12:17.010
So I appreciate the fuck out of that and I'm working hard as crap.

1183
01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:17.461
Crazy.

1184
01:12:17.461 --> 01:12:22.461
I just did my first totally new hour this past weekend at the Ontario Improv.

1185
01:12:22.621 --> 01:12:25.350
So everybody came down for that.
Thank you.
I had a great fucking time.

1186
01:12:25.710 --> 01:12:26.910
And he's back,
ladies and gentlemen.

1187
01:12:27.330 --> 01:12:31.390
So when you were 18 and you first started going to Tristar and a,

1188
01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:33.600
you made your move up to a Montreal,

1189
01:12:33.840 --> 01:12:38.840
how beneficial was it for you as a young guy to be able to train with the

1190
01:12:38.851 --> 01:12:43.650
welterweight champion?
It was awesome.
Fucking huge opportunity,
right?
Yeah.

1191
01:12:43.840 --> 01:12:48.070
<v 0>And not only that,
like George was like such a nice person,</v>

1192
01:12:48.071 --> 01:12:51.400
like probably one of the more welcoming persons there,
you know,

1193
01:12:51.401 --> 01:12:53.620
like he really was like,
oh wow.
You know,
you're really good.

1194
01:12:53.621 --> 01:12:57.720
He was very complimentary to me.
Not only let me train,
but you know,

1195
01:12:57.920 --> 01:13:01.900
he took me around Montreal,
you know,
talk to me.
Oh,

1196
01:13:01.901 --> 01:13:06.250
outside of the gym invited me back to stay with them,
you know,
uh,

1197
01:13:06.550 --> 01:13:10.390
for training trips and things like that.
Like,
you know,
such a,

1198
01:13:10.420 --> 01:13:14.440
such a cool experience and an awesome part of my life.

1199
01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:18.740
<v 2>Yeah.
He's such a nice guy.
It's incredible.
He really is.
It's,</v>

1200
01:13:18.741 --> 01:13:21.920
it's so hard to believe that he's just fucking trained killer.
You know,

1201
01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:24.340
he's a piece.
Yeah.
Cause he's so nice.

1202
01:13:25.420 --> 01:13:29.380
He's so nice but not worried about competition.

1203
01:13:29.381 --> 01:13:33.340
That's what I find fascinating that there's some guys like,
you remember the,
uh,

1204
01:13:33.341 --> 01:13:35.410
the whole thing with Rishad and John Jones.

1205
01:13:35.411 --> 01:13:37.780
Like they were worried about bringing guys in.
Like,

1206
01:13:37.870 --> 01:13:42.550
I'm going to have to fight this guy some day.
You will.
That's crazy.
Yeah.

1207
01:13:42.700 --> 01:13:44.260
That's fat.
I find that,
I knew

1208
01:13:44.970 --> 01:13:48.690
<v 0>there are a lot of people now are like asking me to fight him and this and that.</v>

1209
01:13:48.720 --> 01:13:52.860
You know,
I think it's,
they don't see the,
the things that I,
you know,

1210
01:13:52.861 --> 01:13:57.720
I got to see and I appreciate it.
Not only is like a martial arts,

1211
01:13:57.721 --> 01:13:59.240
but you know,
for myself,
you know,

1212
01:13:59.250 --> 01:14:02.620
I learned so much from him and I gained a lot from,
you know,

1213
01:14:02.730 --> 01:14:06.400
his kindness and uh,
what he gave to me and I don't,

1214
01:14:06.410 --> 01:14:08.790
I'm not going to forget that and stabbing in the back,
you know?

1215
01:14:08.950 --> 01:14:12.460
<v 2>Right.
What would happen if you</v>

1216
01:14:12.580 --> 01:14:17.020
<v 3>do eventually win the title and George does come back?</v>

1217
01:14:17.050 --> 01:14:17.883
I think he just,

1218
01:14:18.650 --> 01:14:19.550
<v 0>you think so?
Yeah.</v>

1219
01:14:20.540 --> 01:14:25.540
I'm pretty sure almost 100% offered you a fucking boatload of cash and the two

1220
01:14:26.901 --> 01:14:31.460
of you got together.
You know what?
Life's not about money.
No.
Obviously,
you know,

1221
01:14:32.070 --> 01:14:35.090
I doing this for money also,
but it's not,
it,

1222
01:14:35.130 --> 01:14:39.970
it's never been my goal to be a fucking billionaire.
Right.

1223
01:14:40.640 --> 01:14:42.200
I'm going to live in the woods one day and

1224
01:14:42.550 --> 01:14:47.060
<v 3>so are you.
Yeah,
for sure man.
Really?
What are you going to do out there?</v>

1225
01:14:47.160 --> 01:14:48.860
I just be weird.
Yeah.

1226
01:14:48.861 --> 01:14:53.861
It'd be weird to hear people call me a fucking psycho and just be,

1227
01:14:55.700 --> 01:14:59.180
uh,
well,
people probably don't call it a cycle in real life,
cause your real life,

1228
01:14:59.181 --> 01:15:00.014
you really normal.

1229
01:15:00.300 --> 01:15:04.700
It's just they know you from the moment you step into that cage and that's when

1230
01:15:04.701 --> 01:15:07.710
you see what the media shows them.
For sure.
Well,

1231
01:15:07.950 --> 01:15:11.840
you know what everybody sees is a fucking camera on you.
You're a fucking psycho.

1232
01:15:12.320 --> 01:15:14.540
Let's re look at,
well I'll play that video again.

1233
01:15:17.840 --> 01:15:20.030
So you eventually going to live in the woods for real.

1234
01:15:20.130 --> 01:15:22.530
<v 0>Yeah.
Yeah,
definitely.
But that's,</v>

1235
01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:26.100
that's the thing that I've been doing,
I've been trying to overcome.

1236
01:15:26.101 --> 01:15:30.780
It's like how am I going to train martial arts and,
and live in the,

1237
01:15:30.781 --> 01:15:32.310
would live in the woods and have a family.

1238
01:15:32.311 --> 01:15:35.910
So I'm going to have to have like some kind of thing worked out.

1239
01:15:36.630 --> 01:15:40.020
<v 3>Well you just got to live close enough to a city.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's the problem.</v>

1240
01:15:40.110 --> 01:15:43.200
I don't want to be close to anyone.
Ah,
how far away do you want to be

1241
01:15:44.970 --> 01:15:47.880
far like helicopter rescue for Vl.
Awesome.

1242
01:15:51.270 --> 01:15:52.920
What is it about wanting to get away?

1243
01:15:53.090 --> 01:15:57.300
<v 0>Well,
I don't know.
I hate,
I just don't like being in the city.
I grew up,
um,</v>

1244
01:15:57.720 --> 01:16:02.670
I grew up in like,
you know,
nature and stuff in my early childhood and stuff.

1245
01:16:02.671 --> 01:16:05.700
And then I got tossed around the city,
you know,

1246
01:16:05.701 --> 01:16:08.220
having to live with parents that moved,
moved away and stuff.

1247
01:16:08.221 --> 01:16:11.130
So I prefer to be out in nature.

1248
01:16:11.880 --> 01:16:14.820
<v 3>Well,
you know what you could do,
you could start your own gym,
you know,</v>

1249
01:16:15.390 --> 01:16:18.450
you are at a point what's going to happen.
I mean,
you think about it,

1250
01:16:18.451 --> 01:16:21.930
you're at a point right now in your career that if you started a gym today,

1251
01:16:21.960 --> 01:16:26.130
people would flock to it and the more you accomplish in your career,

1252
01:16:26.850 --> 01:16:29.490
I mean,
wouldn't even necessarily be a gym that you would have to teach at,

1253
01:16:29.900 --> 01:16:33.950
but just higher my name.
Yeah.
Use Your name or thought about it.

1254
01:16:34.150 --> 01:16:36.650
Maybe an affiliate of Tristar or something like that.
Yeah,

1255
01:16:36.690 --> 01:16:37.680
that would be cool too.

1256
01:16:38.990 --> 01:16:41.960
<v 0>Yeah.
I don't know.
I'm just going to see what happens.
It comes my way.</v>

1257
01:16:42.110 --> 01:16:46.720
I definitely plan on having a home in the woods,
so I love being in the woods.

1258
01:16:46.840 --> 01:16:50.570
Yeah.
Yeah.
You go hunting.
That's so cool,
man.

1259
01:16:50.600 --> 01:16:55.010
I bought my dad a both for his 50th birthday.
Oh really?
Yeah.
No kidding.
Yeah.

1260
01:16:55.280 --> 01:16:59.990
That's cool.
What kind of,
um,
I forget the name of it.
It's a,

1261
01:17:00.050 --> 01:17:03.440
it's a compound bow though.
I lost a few of his arrows,

1262
01:17:04.550 --> 01:17:09.260
not measured for me.
Right.
So it was like it wasn't working for me.
Yeah.

1263
01:17:09.290 --> 01:17:10.100
That's the thing about

1264
01:17:10.100 --> 01:17:14.300
<v 2>Bose,
especially compound bows,
compound bows very specifically,</v>

1265
01:17:14.301 --> 01:17:17.570
you have to get a measure to your draw length and the amount of weight you pull

1266
01:17:17.571 --> 01:17:22.410
back and then the arrows have to be weighted to the correct Bo.

1267
01:17:22.640 --> 01:17:25.550
No,
you can't have an arrow that's too light or a narrow that's too heavy.

1268
01:17:25.551 --> 01:17:27.410
And then you have to site use the,

1269
01:17:27.510 --> 01:17:32.360
the site cause it bows have a site on them and that has to be accurately judged

1270
01:17:32.361 --> 01:17:36.610
based on the weight of the Arrow,
the speed of the Arrow,
poundage of the poll.

1271
01:17:36.630 --> 01:17:40.650
Many details.
There's a lot of details.
I like guns better personally.
Well,

1272
01:17:40.820 --> 01:17:44.720
what I like about guns is that they're really effective.

1273
01:17:44.721 --> 01:17:49.721
Like I shot a moose a couple of weeks ago and in BC way.

1274
01:17:49.950 --> 01:17:53.450
Yeah.
Awesome.
Well,
I'll tell you,

1275
01:17:53.451 --> 01:17:58.451
the place is called a big country outfitters and it's like the mid,

1276
01:17:59.030 --> 01:18:03.470
mid northern mid be seeing Caribou or something.

1277
01:18:03.890 --> 01:18:08.660
No,
I don't think they,
well,
I bet there's some Caribou Caribou.

1278
01:18:08.800 --> 01:18:12.580
I was born.
Oh,
that's hilarious.
That's crazy.
It's north of that.

1279
01:18:12.790 --> 01:18:14.600
It's a little bit north of that.
And they were about,

1280
01:18:15.590 --> 01:18:20.420
I want to say like an a little less than an hour north of Caribou.
That's okay.

1281
01:18:20.900 --> 01:18:24.290
Cool.
Fuck.
We saw some big moves to dam.

1282
01:18:24.770 --> 01:18:27.770
The one I shot was pretty big.
I mean it was young.

1283
01:18:27.771 --> 01:18:31.040
It was only like 900 pounds for a moose.
That's not that big a deal.

1284
01:18:32.480 --> 01:18:35.980
He's saying 900 pounds is not that big.
But we saw one,

1285
01:18:36.020 --> 01:18:39.170
we saw one that was like fucking Jurassic Park.

1286
01:18:39.650 --> 01:18:43.190
We only saw it like briefly for a second.
There was all these females.

1287
01:18:43.191 --> 01:18:45.860
There's all these cows.
There were big,
you know,

1288
01:18:45.861 --> 01:18:49.910
they were probably 900 to a thousand pounds and this mother fucker was twice as

1289
01:18:49.911 --> 01:18:54.650
big as them with his enormous ass,
like this huge legs.

1290
01:18:54.650 --> 01:18:56.930
They were just towering,
but,
and then you just disappeared in the woods.

1291
01:18:56.960 --> 01:19:00.440
We were like,
Holy Shit.
And they have those out there.

1292
01:19:00.441 --> 01:19:04.970
These just giant fucking Mousse.
Yeah.
BCS.
Amazing.

1293
01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.790
And so many wolves that they encourage people to kill them.

1294
01:19:08.100 --> 01:19:11.990
And I know it did become like pes,

1295
01:19:12.230 --> 01:19:14.180
but where we were,
the guy,
um,

1296
01:19:14.210 --> 01:19:18.200
his neighbor got a cow taken by wolves.

1297
01:19:18.230 --> 01:19:21.980
Like they're in their house and they hear how old's and crazy shit and they look

1298
01:19:21.981 --> 01:19:26.650
out the window.
It was like 20 wolves ripping a cow apart.
Yeah.
It happens.
They,

1299
01:19:26.690 --> 01:19:28.880
they um,
well those aren't bad though,

1300
01:19:28.910 --> 01:19:31.910
but there's just a lot of them right now and BC well,
you know,

1301
01:19:31.911 --> 01:19:33.890
there's balanced to the ecosystem.
Yeah,
exactly.

1302
01:19:33.891 --> 01:19:36.620
And they're very important to that.
Sure.
You know,

1303
01:19:36.621 --> 01:19:40.940
for all sorts of reasons to keep rodents down and to keep populations healthy

1304
01:19:40.941 --> 01:19:44.030
and to make sure that,
and they catch the disease.
Then animals eat.

1305
01:19:44.110 --> 01:19:48.470
He usually in like the,
like the big pack of Caribou that they,
uh,

1306
01:19:48.471 --> 01:19:51.680
they usually catch like the sick ones and the weak ones.

1307
01:19:52.160 --> 01:19:53.330
It's when they get out of whack,

1308
01:19:53.331 --> 01:19:55.730
when there's too many of them and that can happen.

1309
01:19:55.731 --> 01:19:59.510
They get on these giant super pacs.
They have a big issue with that.

1310
01:19:59.511 --> 01:20:01.220
In Russia there was a,
yeah,

1311
01:20:01.240 --> 01:20:04.460
a couple of years ago there was the super packs that were taken out.
Horses,

1312
01:20:04.850 --> 01:20:08.260
they were like a hundred wolves strong,
just really nuts and they would,

1313
01:20:08.640 --> 01:20:11.940
that's insane.
Take a fucking horse out.
Wow.

1314
01:20:12.090 --> 01:20:15.800
Would you live up there like that kind of area up like near Caribou?

1315
01:20:15.801 --> 01:20:19.410
Is that where you would live?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Probably Roy MacDonald,

1316
01:20:19.440 --> 01:20:23.280
mixed martial arts academy.
Set it up.
People come and live in the woods.

1317
01:20:23.490 --> 01:20:27.210
<v 0>Yeah,
maybe.
That'd be awesome.
Who knows what'll happen?</v>

1318
01:20:27.560 --> 01:20:31.550
<v 2>Well,
you're living in like a pretty metropolitan area.
You're living in Montreal.</v>

1319
01:20:32.150 --> 01:20:36.310
Do you live in an like an apartment like in the city?
Yeah.
That's gotta be weird.

1320
01:20:36.311 --> 01:20:41.300
That sucks.
You know,
like what is the issue?
Is it too much noise?

1321
01:20:41.301 --> 01:20:42.230
Too many people

1322
01:20:43.250 --> 01:20:48.250
<v 0>preferred to be with like trees and lakes and less like craziness and honking</v>

1323
01:20:50.181 --> 01:20:54.940
and the anxiety of this that comes along with the city.
Something about it.
And I,

1324
01:20:54.941 --> 01:20:58.130
I can't really explain it.
I grew up with it.
Right.
So it's like,

1325
01:20:58.220 --> 01:21:01.560
that's what I always look back on it my best times.
Right?
Yeah.

1326
01:21:01.790 --> 01:21:05.230
<v 2>Yeah.
I always find it weird that some people love it.
Like,
uh,</v>

1327
01:21:06.350 --> 01:21:09.410
my manager lives in New York City and he loves it.

1328
01:21:09.500 --> 01:21:11.360
He loves the screens off the city.

1329
01:21:11.920 --> 01:21:16.920
<v 0>I have to go in the park every day when I trained there to like balance out.</v>

1330
01:21:18.600 --> 01:21:21.620
<v 2>I hate it there.
Really?
Yeah.
Hate the city.
So what do you do?</v>

1331
01:21:21.650 --> 01:21:24.980
You just go feed pigeons or some shit.
Yeah.
Walk around,
shout out.

1332
01:21:26.070 --> 01:21:29.280
Just relax.
Yeah,
man.
Do you have,
um,

1333
01:21:29.340 --> 01:21:33.300
like things that you do?
Like,
do you,
do you meditate?

1334
01:21:33.330 --> 01:21:35.790
Do you do anything to try to calm yourself down?

1335
01:21:35.940 --> 01:21:40.260
<v 0>No,
I think a lot.
Daydream a lot.
So maybe that's meditation for me</v>

1336
01:21:40.710 --> 01:21:43.990
<v 2>kind of in a way.
Yeah.
Not Discipline.
It's not like discipline.</v>

1337
01:21:44.760 --> 01:21:47.610
Have you ever fucked around with a sensory deprivation tank?
No,

1338
01:21:47.611 --> 01:21:51.410
but I was texting you.
I want to do that,
man.
Yeah,
that's right.
And for us,

1339
01:21:51.411 --> 01:21:53.700
the ones that do it too well,
let's,
I'll hook it up.

1340
01:21:53.790 --> 01:21:56.760
I'm sure there's gotta be a place in Montreal.
I know there's a big place.
Yeah.

1341
01:21:57.090 --> 01:22:00.750
In Vancouver that opened up recently.
It makes sense though,
right?
Yeah.
Yeah.

1342
01:22:00.751 --> 01:22:04.530
Frankie Edgar was just tweeting me today.
He just did his first session today.

1343
01:22:04.950 --> 01:22:08.010
Is it,
it takes like a few times to learn how to relax.
You were saying,
right?

1344
01:22:08.070 --> 01:22:12.960
Yeah.
Well I wouldn't say it takes a few times to learn how to relax,

1345
01:22:12.961 --> 01:22:16.110
but just to be comfortable with the experience,

1346
01:22:16.111 --> 01:22:20.340
it becomes a normal thing.
You know?
It's,
it's so weird.

1347
01:22:20.341 --> 01:22:25.220
There's so much,
so much strangeness to it the First Time you do it.
Okay.

1348
01:22:25.221 --> 01:22:28.830
Then I think you get more out of it and when you do it two,
three or four times.

1349
01:22:28.860 --> 01:22:33.080
Okay.
Like I have one of my house,
so to me going in it,

1350
01:22:33.110 --> 01:22:35.820
it's like normal everyday thing.
It's like,
okay,

1351
01:22:35.821 --> 01:22:39.060
I'm going to the tank now and I tell my wife,
leave me alone.
I'll be,

1352
01:22:39.210 --> 01:22:43.470
I'll be back in a couple of hours and I just go in there and hours.
Huh?
Yeah,

1353
01:22:43.471 --> 01:22:46.320
I like to do two hours.
Okay,
cool.
I can do what,
one hour.

1354
01:22:46.321 --> 01:22:47.520
Like if I know I have a show,

1355
01:22:47.760 --> 01:22:50.340
like if I have to leave the house at seven for a show,
I can,

1356
01:22:50.400 --> 01:22:54.030
I can go in at five and go in for an hour and a half or something and take a

1357
01:22:54.031 --> 01:22:58.350
shower.
But I prefer it at night when my family's asleep.
Okay.

1358
01:22:58.410 --> 01:22:59.550
Everyone's conked out.

1359
01:22:59.800 --> 01:23:02.190
I like to go in there because then I know I'm just going to go on my own.

1360
01:23:02.220 --> 01:23:05.620
I'm not as no other energy in the house,
if that makes any sense.
Yeah,
for sure.

1361
01:23:06.200 --> 01:23:10.900
Like I do all my best writing when everyone's asleep and it's,
you know,

1362
01:23:10.901 --> 01:23:14.070
when you have a family especially you're always managing shit.
You know,

1363
01:23:14.100 --> 01:23:18.460
like there's always like things like she took my thing calm down,

1364
01:23:18.461 --> 01:23:20.740
everybody relaxed and it was like,
you know,

1365
01:23:20.741 --> 01:23:23.080
it's hard to write when all that's going on,

1366
01:23:23.400 --> 01:23:26.050
but it's way hard to like relax.

1367
01:23:26.110 --> 01:23:28.810
Like if I was in the tank and I heard screaming from upstairs,

1368
01:23:28.830 --> 01:23:33.280
like got gotta get out of the fucking tank,
who's yelling at who?
Who Do what,

1369
01:23:33.281 --> 01:23:36.090
you know,
that would,
that would suck.
So it's,

1370
01:23:36.130 --> 01:23:40.630
it's best in a state of complete quiet,

1371
01:23:40.810 --> 01:23:45.070
you know,
if you can,
if you can.
Isolation.
Yeah.
Peaceful.
Yeah,
for sure.

1372
01:23:45.100 --> 01:23:46.780
And then you enter into it,
it's like,

1373
01:23:47.210 --> 01:23:50.320
think about the most piece that you've ever found when you're in the woods and

1374
01:23:50.321 --> 01:23:54.490
nature and multiply that by a hundred really as it removes your body,

1375
01:23:54.530 --> 01:23:57.580
it removes all the input of your body because you're floating,

1376
01:23:57.820 --> 01:24:02.050
you feel like you're flying.
It's crazy as it dead.

1377
01:24:02.200 --> 01:24:03.190
It's very intense.

1378
01:24:03.290 --> 01:24:07.720
And it's crazy to me that I'm the guy who keeps telling people about it.

1379
01:24:07.721 --> 01:24:11.440
I'm like,
how is this not the way more popular?
Right.
It never understood it.

1380
01:24:11.780 --> 01:24:14.620
I'm like,
how was it?
Like why do you have to hear from me?

1381
01:24:14.650 --> 01:24:19.220
Like how is this not like a huge thing of so many people's lives?

1382
01:24:19.240 --> 01:24:21.270
Especially when you think of it,

1383
01:24:21.300 --> 01:24:25.570
how much of every boom we were talking about the mind and how much of effect the

1384
01:24:25.571 --> 01:24:30.130
mine has on your performance and how important it is to achieve certain

1385
01:24:30.131 --> 01:24:34.180
mindsets,
right?
There's no better place to get to know your fucking brain,

1386
01:24:34.210 --> 01:24:35.140
the tank.

1387
01:24:35.500 --> 01:24:40.500
And I would think with so many people being so performance oriented and goal

1388
01:24:40.601 --> 01:24:45.430
oriented and achievement oriented that that would be a huge tool.
Yeah,

1389
01:24:45.431 --> 01:24:48.040
it makes complete sense to me.
Right.
We're going to get you in there.

1390
01:24:48.070 --> 01:24:50.350
We'll get you in there.
As soon as we get done with this podcast,

1391
01:24:50.351 --> 01:24:54.220
I'm going to call it crash.
Okay.
That float lab and we'll hook something up.
Okay,

1392
01:24:54.370 --> 01:24:58.270
awesome.
Where are you staying while you're in town?
By lax.
Oh perfect.

1393
01:24:58.310 --> 01:25:02.340
Cause he's in Venice.
So again it's like,
yeah,
it's like 15 minutes away.
What?

1394
01:25:02.350 --> 01:25:06.790
Awesome.
Yeah,
I'm down.
I'm down here until like the fourth and I leave to Vegas.

1395
01:25:07.030 --> 01:25:11.920
Nice.
Yeah.
So you're down here just doing the thing,
having a good time,

1396
01:25:11.960 --> 01:25:15.610
getting some training in,
hopefully training with as much people as possible.

1397
01:25:16.210 --> 01:25:19.030
Is that when you come into town,
like a place like that?

1398
01:25:19.180 --> 01:25:22.150
Is it difficult to raise that or it's everybody just welcome you with open arms?

1399
01:25:22.780 --> 01:25:27.160
Um,
I dunno,
I haven't really haven't trained with anyone yet,
so hopefully it's,

1400
01:25:27.200 --> 01:25:31.270
you haven't tried that before?
Uh,
in Cali?
No,
that's my next time.
Oh,
okay.

1401
01:25:31.720 --> 01:25:36.570
So you just showed up.
Yeah,
I'll,
I'll,
I'll probably like try to like,
you know,

1402
01:25:36.580 --> 01:25:38.500
want to go to check out Eddie's place.

1403
01:25:38.760 --> 01:25:43.760
George has spent some time here so hopefully he'll get me a see Freddy and

1404
01:25:44.560 --> 01:25:45.470
Freddy Roach.
Yeah.

1405
01:25:45.471 --> 01:25:50.290
So and network with people and hopefully I can get a spot with a different gyms

1406
01:25:50.291 --> 01:25:53.420
and see what it's all about when that,
how's that work?
Like when you,

1407
01:25:53.450 --> 01:25:54.910
when you train with a guy like Freddy Roach,

1408
01:25:54.911 --> 01:25:58.570
you have to pay him or does it take in,
you don't know?
I don't know.
Either.

1409
01:25:58.571 --> 01:26:02.200
One's fine.
Right.
Just got to get in the work.
Yeah.
Yeah.
If I have to pay him,

1410
01:26:02.260 --> 01:26:04.970
no problem with that.
What about Moitai?

1411
01:26:05.060 --> 01:26:08.180
Are you looking to do some more time when you're in town too?
Yeah.
Anything.

1412
01:26:08.210 --> 01:26:12.630
I'd actually,
I want to learn your sidekick.
It backache,
man.
I'd be happy.
Yeah,

1413
01:26:12.710 --> 01:26:15.750
let's work out.
Definitely cool.
Be happy to show you some stuff.
Yeah.

1414
01:26:15.830 --> 01:26:19.890
Well you're so flexible already and you throw,
so you have so much dexterity.

1415
01:26:19.891 --> 01:26:23.930
We you liked that question mark kick.
You throw out a a lot,
right?
Yeah.
Yeah.

1416
01:26:23.931 --> 01:26:27.380
I've been trying to get more dynamic with my cane.
So,

1417
01:26:27.980 --> 01:26:32.660
well the front leg side kick is the one that I see making a big comeback in MMA.

1418
01:26:32.661 --> 01:26:36.800
I mean Jon Jones loves to do that to the thigh and he even dropped v tour to the

1419
01:26:36.801 --> 01:26:39.920
body with the,
I did.
That was an awesome kick.
Yeah,
you're right.

1420
01:26:40.130 --> 01:26:43.520
That was a big kick in in my arsenal.

1421
01:26:43.580 --> 01:26:47.610
The front leg side kick and I'm a short guy,
but my friend Larry,
um,

1422
01:26:47.660 --> 01:26:51.260
my friend Larry Jones who was a high level black belt back in the day,

1423
01:26:51.740 --> 01:26:54.920
he was a tall guy.
He's like six foot three and he was all legs,

1424
01:26:54.921 --> 01:26:59.720
his legs to his fucking rib cage and this dude would just impale people with his

1425
01:26:59.721 --> 01:27:02.900
front leg side kick he just had developed,
have never worked.

1426
01:27:03.260 --> 01:27:06.670
I'd love to work that,
you know,
was good.
It as Cajun Johnson.
Oh yeah.

1427
01:27:06.680 --> 01:27:11.210
Good Front leg kick.
Yeah,
I definitely like to work that out with you.
Yeah,

1428
01:27:11.211 --> 01:27:15.110
it's a weird technique because it's so effective at keeping distance from the

1429
01:27:15.111 --> 01:27:17.090
guy,
like a sideways stance.

1430
01:27:17.091 --> 01:27:20.150
Like you're seeing that sideways stance play out.

1431
01:27:20.151 --> 01:27:24.680
Like Wonderboy is really Stephen Thompson really good at that sideways stance.

1432
01:27:24.681 --> 01:27:25.190
Yeah.

1433
01:27:25.190 --> 01:27:30.170
He's a really fucking interesting addition to a UFC.

1434
01:27:30.210 --> 01:27:34.880
Yeah.
Yeah.
He's awesome.
I've trained with him before.
His striking is amazing.

1435
01:27:34.910 --> 01:27:37.470
Yeah.
And he moves like a snake,
you know,

1436
01:27:37.520 --> 01:27:41.670
in and ask it back and forth and with a big case too.
That's so,

1437
01:27:41.720 --> 01:27:45.350
so hard to deal with the wrestlers.
Well I've always thought,

1438
01:27:45.380 --> 01:27:48.110
I always wondered what the UFC would be like.

1439
01:27:48.170 --> 01:27:51.750
It was in like a basketball sized place.

1440
01:27:51.751 --> 01:27:55.160
Even they're like Metamorris Sao enormous.

1441
01:27:55.660 --> 01:27:57.890
Well I don't like men have more is because it gets near the edge and it looks

1442
01:27:57.891 --> 01:28:02.870
like people are falling off and like a,
you ever see chrome Gracie versus um,

1443
01:28:03.020 --> 01:28:06.290
uh,
what does this Aoki Yacht with the tights?
Yeah.

1444
01:28:06.350 --> 01:28:07.880
I had got like right on the edge.

1445
01:28:07.881 --> 01:28:10.120
It looked like they were going to separate and chrome caught him with a gay

1446
01:28:10.121 --> 01:28:13.550
teens.
Oh really?
He's like a weird like,
sorry to break.

1447
01:28:14.320 --> 01:28:17.370
It was a weird sort of it when you know,
crawling gets a guillotine on you,

1448
01:28:17.371 --> 01:28:21.400
you're,
you're fucking toast.
He's got a nasty fucking guillotine.
He's,

1449
01:28:21.410 --> 01:28:23.060
his technique is so slick,

1450
01:28:23.810 --> 01:28:27.770
so hard for to get a surface that works for,
you know,

1451
01:28:28.220 --> 01:28:32.360
people want to come pain watch hard.
Well it also,

1452
01:28:32.390 --> 01:28:37.070
the cage kind of gets in the way.
A little bit of the view,
you know,

1453
01:28:37.430 --> 01:28:40.460
like it's better than the ring at the same time.
Right.
Right.
Frame in May.

1454
01:28:41.060 --> 01:28:42.690
I think it's definitely better than the rank family man.

1455
01:28:43.160 --> 01:28:44.600
I think they're bringing sloppy,

1456
01:28:44.810 --> 01:28:48.920
like watching guys fall out of the ring or who was it?

1457
01:28:48.921 --> 01:28:51.350
Was it Paulo Filio?
Someone caught someone,

1458
01:28:51.351 --> 01:28:55.450
an arm bar where their arm was wrapped up in the rain in the road road.
Yeah.

1459
01:28:55.451 --> 01:28:59.150
It wasn't it.
So there's a few guys like that.
Yeah.
That's stupid.

1460
01:28:59.300 --> 01:29:03.740
That doesn't make any sense to me.
Yeah,
I guess it's a mess.
And then,
um,

1461
01:29:03.960 --> 01:29:05.700
they tried different things.

1462
01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:10.530
Like frank shamrock tried some weird thing at one point in time or it was like

1463
01:29:10.710 --> 01:29:14.970
sort of like a swimming pool,
like surfing,
it's flat.

1464
01:29:14.971 --> 01:29:19.110
And then the judges were like ramped up a bit and then cage.
Yeah,
no,
no,

1465
01:29:19.111 --> 01:29:23.380
that was like Yama Yama pit fighting.

1466
01:29:23.630 --> 01:29:25.770
No.
Well,

1467
01:29:25.771 --> 01:29:30.270
that was Bob Meyrowitz who was the guy who was the first owner of the UFC.

1468
01:29:30.540 --> 01:29:34.830
He created that Yama thing.
Right.
And if that's just the fucking name,

1469
01:29:35.130 --> 01:29:38.100
like someone should have said,
Yo,
you can't call it

1470
01:29:40.810 --> 01:29:43.290
what they're thinking,
you know,
but um,

1471
01:29:43.500 --> 01:29:45.630
the idea behind is not the worst idea in the world.

1472
01:29:45.631 --> 01:29:47.680
And World Combat League use something like that.

1473
01:29:47.681 --> 01:29:51.320
I remember Chuck Norris's organization was kicked by a gang and had some,

1474
01:29:51.460 --> 01:29:55.590
Wonderboy was in that too.
Yeah,
he was,
yeah.
He was one of the best guys in that.

1475
01:29:55.620 --> 01:30:00.390
Yeah.
That world combat league was kind of interesting,
you know,
some good fights.

1476
01:30:00.510 --> 01:30:04.380
Yeah.
And I've seen glory in on spike,

1477
01:30:04.410 --> 01:30:07.470
which I think is pretty interesting too.
You get to see,
uh,

1478
01:30:07.890 --> 01:30:12.750
some really high level Moitai Thai guys,
but with like slightly different rules.

1479
01:30:13.360 --> 01:30:18.290
I prefer the Moitai rules.
I like the fact that they can clench and elbow and,

1480
01:30:18.291 --> 01:30:23.260
and hold on and throw in multiple needs.
Exactly.
Yeah.
And Moy,

1481
01:30:23.261 --> 01:30:28.261
Tai as an art form is so it's so fascinating to watch because you know,

1482
01:30:28.920 --> 01:30:32.910
I'm a big boxing fan,
but the reality of boxing is,
you know,
there are,

1483
01:30:32.911 --> 01:30:34.410
there are a masters like a,

1484
01:30:34.470 --> 01:30:38.910
like a Floyd Mayweather use it in this incredibly beautiful way to watch you

1485
01:30:38.911 --> 01:30:40.080
know,
you,
you use,

1486
01:30:40.350 --> 01:30:44.400
you see the way he's using footwork and angles and countering and faints and

1487
01:30:44.401 --> 01:30:46.200
it's,
it's beautiful to watch it all pulled together.

1488
01:30:46.620 --> 01:30:50.520
But then you see a guy who's like a real,

1489
01:30:50.580 --> 01:30:52.680
like a Kevin Ross type,
uh,
you know,

1490
01:30:53.100 --> 01:30:57.540
uses everything constantly using elbows,
leg kicks,
knees clench,

1491
01:30:57.680 --> 01:31:00.090
throws it all the lion fight.
You watched lion fight.

1492
01:31:00.780 --> 01:31:02.550
Lion fight is a promotion out of Vegas.

1493
01:31:02.610 --> 01:31:06.420
Like one of the big Moy Tai Promotions in the United States.

1494
01:31:06.420 --> 01:31:09.270
They are on access TV all the time.
You ever heard of it?

1495
01:31:09.300 --> 01:31:13.010
Really high level guys come over and the fighting,
uh,

1496
01:31:13.140 --> 01:31:18.140
like Thai guys are fighting like yachts and Cli fight fights for them about Mala

1497
01:31:18.561 --> 01:31:22.680
pet fights for them.
Like real high level Thai guys and they're using everything.

1498
01:31:22.760 --> 01:31:25.350
It's a lot of clinching,
lot of knees,
elbows.

1499
01:31:25.520 --> 01:31:29.040
It is beautiful because you get to see how this works,

1500
01:31:29.041 --> 01:31:33.120
like how you know there's distances where you know you should punch,

1501
01:31:33.121 --> 01:31:34.800
there's distances where you should kick theirs.

1502
01:31:34.810 --> 01:31:38.610
And then when you see it all combined like a really good,

1503
01:31:38.611 --> 01:31:42.840
like a Kevin Ross type dude who's like combining it all together in perfect

1504
01:31:42.841 --> 01:31:46.020
harmony.
It's beautiful to watch.
It's such a,
it's,

1505
01:31:46.290 --> 01:31:49.230
it's another style of,
it's another art form,

1506
01:31:49.410 --> 01:31:53.430
which I think a little bit is lost when you have something like glory where you

1507
01:31:53.431 --> 01:31:55.500
don't allow guys to clinch for,

1508
01:31:55.920 --> 01:31:57.960
I think they have like a five second rule or something like that.

1509
01:31:58.460 --> 01:32:00.040
And you don't have a lot of guys to pull down on the

1510
01:32:00.040 --> 01:32:04.210
<v 3>head and throw.
Nice.
It's bizarre.
And no elbows,</v>

1511
01:32:04.480 --> 01:32:08.350
which is another thing that I think is kind of silly.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

1512
01:32:08.351 --> 01:32:12.130
I'm the same as you.
It's a purist thing.
The less restrictions it better.

1513
01:32:12.280 --> 01:32:16.210
And who do you do?
You're more tie with up in Canada for us.
For us.

1514
01:32:16.380 --> 01:32:20.260
So for us as your Moitai coach?
Yeah.
Is he also,
does he,

1515
01:32:20.320 --> 01:32:22.390
I mean he's obviously a very good grappler himself.
Yeah.

1516
01:32:22.391 --> 01:32:25.310
He's black belt and then down here,
does he in,

1517
01:32:25.690 --> 01:32:28.480
does he coach you on that too or does he bring it to someone else to do it or,

1518
01:32:28.860 --> 01:32:33.790
no,
he's,
he's like my,
he's the guy I go to pretty much for everything.
But yeah,

1519
01:32:33.791 --> 01:32:38.590
I'll go around and like I'll work a boxing with a Howard Grad and stuff,

1520
01:32:38.591 --> 01:32:43.300
but most like almost everything I do with for us,

1521
01:32:43.480 --> 01:32:46.210
we really have a close connection and for us is,
uh,

1522
01:32:47.290 --> 01:32:50.500
a lot of people don't understand how skilled he is.
It everything.

1523
01:32:50.530 --> 01:32:52.120
He's a really good wrestler,

1524
01:32:52.860 --> 01:32:57.860
Jujitsu and kickboxer and he understands it well and he knows how to teach it

1525
01:32:57.941 --> 01:33:02.170
really well.
Well,
you could tell just listening to him coach,
you know,
his,

1526
01:33:02.171 --> 01:33:06.160
his take on things and the way he described things like when they do interviews

1527
01:33:06.161 --> 01:33:10.130
with them,
like he,
he doesn't have a cursory knowledge of it is pretty in depth.

1528
01:33:10.140 --> 01:33:14.080
You can,
you can pretty much tell that.
He's also obviously a very smart guy,

1529
01:33:14.460 --> 01:33:18.990
you know?
Yeah.
He's got a degree and you know,
he,
he,

1530
01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:22.750
he's very,
uh,
he knows how to speak well and express himself well.

1531
01:33:23.110 --> 01:33:26.350
Do you see yourself after you're done fighting,
doing something like that?

1532
01:33:26.351 --> 01:33:29.650
Do you see yourself coaching?
Probably not.
No.
Yeah,
not interested.

1533
01:33:29.680 --> 01:33:33.100
Maybe if the right guy came along or something the right thing.

1534
01:33:33.400 --> 01:33:37.870
I probably go onto something else in my life though.
Like what?
I don't know.

1535
01:33:38.680 --> 01:33:42.850
Find something.
It's another interest that I want to dive into.

1536
01:33:43.240 --> 01:33:45.430
Do you have like a longterm plan?

1537
01:33:45.431 --> 01:33:50.431
Do you have like an idea of what your tomorrow just tomorrow you do you know

1538
01:33:50.711 --> 01:33:53.870
like when you want to get out.
Do you have an idea?
No clue.
No.

1539
01:33:53.980 --> 01:33:56.920
I always told myself I'm just going to do it until I don't like it anyway.

1540
01:33:56.921 --> 01:34:00.010
That's pretty much how I operate my life.

1541
01:34:00.011 --> 01:34:02.770
My brother laughs at me all the time because I just have like,

1542
01:34:03.130 --> 01:34:07.990
I don't have a plan.
I just do whatever's fun and that's it.

1543
01:34:08.080 --> 01:34:10.810
That must drive tricks.
Crazy chicks hate that shit.

1544
01:34:11.570 --> 01:34:15.010
Are we going to be a year from now where,
what about five years from now Rory?

1545
01:34:15.910 --> 01:34:19.610
Longterm plan.
My girlfriend.
She's,
yeah,
she's,

1546
01:34:19.950 --> 01:34:21.490
she's a little bit different for me in that,

1547
01:34:21.491 --> 01:34:26.240
but it's Kinda balances balances us out a bit.
But you know,
she,

1548
01:34:26.260 --> 01:34:30.010
she rolls with uh,
pretty well,
but yeah,
I'm pretty Rad.
No,

1549
01:34:30.970 --> 01:34:35.400
like this trip was random.
Totally,
totally random.
I just decided,
I was like,
oh,

1550
01:34:35.401 --> 01:34:36.580
I'm just going to stay in California.

1551
01:34:36.760 --> 01:34:39.430
So you came out here to compete and said fuck it.
I'm just going to stay.

1552
01:34:39.850 --> 01:34:42.160
That was the random aspect of it.
But competing part.

1553
01:34:42.370 --> 01:34:44.950
How long did you plan it out to?
Um,
that's actually,

1554
01:34:44.951 --> 01:34:48.400
it was when I was training for the [inaudible] fight I was eating and I was
like,

1555
01:34:48.430 --> 01:34:51.670
oh,
I was thinking about Jujitsu and I was like,
I'd love to do metamorris.

1556
01:34:51.940 --> 01:34:55.480
So I texted a,
I managed to get in touch with them and they're like,
oh yeah,

1557
01:34:55.481 --> 01:34:58.460
here's the name.
And I'm like,
okay,
I'll,
I'll overall with him,

1558
01:34:59.040 --> 01:35:03.080
do you have to run that shit by the UFC?
Yeah,
dip it.
They accepted right away.

1559
01:35:03.170 --> 01:35:06.560
That's interesting.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Cause I would think that like,

1560
01:35:06.561 --> 01:35:08.390
you could get an arm broken or some shit like that.

1561
01:35:10.420 --> 01:35:14.420
You got caught man pre deep Kamora yeah,
my arm was hurting for a couple of days.

1562
01:35:14.421 --> 01:35:17.840
It's just starting to feel better today.
Did you think about tapping?
No.

1563
01:35:18.260 --> 01:35:21.560
So you're going to let them snap your arm?
What the fuck?
Like wait,

1564
01:35:21.570 --> 01:35:26.420
now I feel like,
yeah,
if like before the match I was like yeah,
I'd probably tap.

1565
01:35:26.750 --> 01:35:30.180
But then when I was in the position I was like,
there's no fucking way of tasks.

1566
01:35:32.060 --> 01:35:33.610
That's so crazy though.
Yeah.

1567
01:35:34.640 --> 01:35:39.620
Well there's that fine line between where you were cause you got out of it.

1568
01:35:39.750 --> 01:35:44.270
Yeah.
And you know,
getting it snapped.
Yeah.

1569
01:35:44.420 --> 01:35:46.190
I mean that's,
yeah,
I still,

1570
01:35:46.510 --> 01:35:51.510
with that particular move it's kind of hard to really do serious damage cause

1571
01:35:51.610 --> 01:35:55.160
you know the legs and hips aren't under it.
Right.
But,

1572
01:35:55.570 --> 01:35:59.950
but you watch like Frank Mir versus big Nog.
Yeah.
Like Ooh,

1573
01:36:00.130 --> 01:36:03.340
that's a hard one to watch.
When you see that was more like her arm.

1574
01:36:03.380 --> 01:36:05.600
That was more like the,
it was bent over this way.

1575
01:36:05.620 --> 01:36:10.070
Mine was like the straight arm lock.
Yeah.
But still,

1576
01:36:10.100 --> 01:36:13.640
I mean guys had gotten their elbows snapped on that.
Yeah.
But that one,

1577
01:36:13.641 --> 01:36:15.500
that was August one it was an ugly one.

1578
01:36:15.810 --> 01:36:18.570
Cause that when that upper arm snaps for some reason,

1579
01:36:18.571 --> 01:36:21.530
that book like here or something,
right?
Yeah.
That's a weird,

1580
01:36:21.560 --> 01:36:25.070
real weird Bill Franks.
I'm fucking big guy.
Tank.
Yeah.

1581
01:36:25.220 --> 01:36:28.720
And that was back when testosterone replacement therapy was legal.

1582
01:36:28.950 --> 01:36:33.680
So you're allowed to be a hopped up on the special sauce.

1583
01:36:34.040 --> 01:36:37.880
That's weird,
didn't it?
That was legal.
I so stupid.

1584
01:36:38.390 --> 01:36:41.090
Strange.
Yeah.
I can't remember if it was a loud,

1585
01:36:41.720 --> 01:36:46.130
well it's strange medically too because it just shows you how you found a

1586
01:36:46.131 --> 01:36:46.964
loophole.

1587
01:36:47.540 --> 01:36:52.540
What also shows you what a piss poor job athletic commissions do with

1588
01:36:52.551 --> 01:36:55.010
recognizing what shouldn't,
shouldn't be legal.
It's insane.

1589
01:36:55.050 --> 01:37:00.050
And a lot of the tests they do or like it's like there's like one to one and

1590
01:37:01.311 --> 01:37:05.830
then they should be able to test one,
two,
one.
And what's synthetic,
you know,

1591
01:37:05.960 --> 01:37:07.100
re being replaced.

1592
01:37:07.101 --> 01:37:10.790
They can only test a lot of them only test for like one to six.

1593
01:37:12.380 --> 01:37:17.210
So you could be one to one to six synthetic steroids or whatever you're using

1594
01:37:17.810 --> 01:37:20.480
and you could still get away with it.
Really.
Yeah.

1595
01:37:20.481 --> 01:37:21.830
I heard some crazy stuff like that.

1596
01:37:21.831 --> 01:37:25.670
That's why the whole like Vaga and water thing didn't work out.

1597
01:37:25.671 --> 01:37:30.350
I'm pretty sure because Vida does the one to one.
Oh,

1598
01:37:30.351 --> 01:37:32.900
I don't know what you mean by what?
Like when you're saying one to one,

1599
01:37:32.901 --> 01:37:35.900
what do you mean?
Like they could test like your natural teeth.

1600
01:37:35.930 --> 01:37:40.850
I'm not super educated on it,
so maybe I shouldn't be open your mouth about it,

1601
01:37:41.090 --> 01:37:41.923
but uh,

1602
01:37:42.340 --> 01:37:47.340
like they could test synthetic steroids to your natural testosterone levels.

1603
01:37:49.250 --> 01:37:53.310
Okay.
Yeah.
Well they're realizing now that they can test for everything,

1604
01:37:53.311 --> 01:37:55.430
like which shall sign and got popped.
You know,

1605
01:37:55.860 --> 01:37:59.290
the new shit that they're doing it,
he was waiting to answer.
Oh,

1606
01:37:59.940 --> 01:38:01.990
well that was during the Anderson Silva fight.
His,
yeah,

1607
01:38:02.070 --> 01:38:06.150
his testosterone to epitestosterone,
which I don't understand how that works,

1608
01:38:06.151 --> 01:38:07.710
but it's essentially,

1609
01:38:07.770 --> 01:38:11.990
it's an indicator that you're using artificial testosterone.
Um,

1610
01:38:12.300 --> 01:38:15.810
but he got the most recent one.
We got suspended for two years.

1611
01:38:15.811 --> 01:38:17.580
He got popped for EPO.

1612
01:38:17.890 --> 01:38:22.230
He got popped for Clomid and all sorts of shit.

1613
01:38:22.231 --> 01:38:27.030
Growth Hormone.
I mean,
he was on a cocktail.
That's crazy.
Different things.
Yeah.

1614
01:38:27.090 --> 01:38:30.420
I'm in.
Makes you wonder?
I mean,
how it could be better in my opinion though,

1615
01:38:30.510 --> 01:38:34.770
for sure.
I think they should test to the maximum ability.

1616
01:38:34.771 --> 01:38:39.510
I think that would be the best.
Sure.
But the problem is it's about $40,000.

1617
01:38:40.590 --> 01:38:42.240
That's what every blood test like that is.

1618
01:38:42.241 --> 01:38:44.730
And they have this chain of custody where they take the blood from you,

1619
01:38:44.731 --> 01:38:47.520
they fucking essentially put it in a suitcase,
handcuffed themselves to it,

1620
01:38:47.670 --> 01:38:51.260
fly to the lab,
like if they have to come the whole procedure.
Right?
Yeah.
Yeah.

1621
01:38:51.270 --> 01:38:56.210
I did the VAT attest name for the Bj Penn fight,
right?
Yeah,
there was,
Bj was a,

1622
01:38:56.250 --> 01:39:00.650
he asked me on Twitter,
if you,
if our fight,
we could do the uh,

1623
01:39:01.190 --> 01:39:06.150
um,
testing from a whole training camp and they sponsored it.

1624
01:39:06.420 --> 01:39:10.050
And so they took all the costs and everything worked out great.

1625
01:39:10.060 --> 01:39:14.910
But both obviously passed and yeah.
Beach good.
It was good for this part,

1626
01:39:14.911 --> 01:39:18.090
I think.
And that's what George wanted to do with Hendrix.
But you know,

1627
01:39:18.091 --> 01:39:22.560
that whole debacle happened.
Yeah.
That was a,

1628
01:39:22.561 --> 01:39:25.260
that was a weird situation.
Right.
The,
um,

1629
01:39:25.370 --> 01:39:29.400
like George was upset at that after he left and you know,

1630
01:39:29.401 --> 01:39:32.070
said that that was one thing that he wants to stand up for.

1631
01:39:32.070 --> 01:39:36.030
It was that we need more testing in the USA.
Where was that coming from?

1632
01:39:36.031 --> 01:39:37.080
From George?
Like what does,

1633
01:39:37.110 --> 01:39:40.540
what does his concern that people are cheating I think.
Yeah.

1634
01:39:40.820 --> 01:39:42.990
Right a lot specifically.

1635
01:39:44.370 --> 01:39:48.480
Does he know what they're doing or who or what?
I don't know.
I don't know.

1636
01:39:48.600 --> 01:39:52.110
He just assumes or maybe maybe I,
you know,

1637
01:39:52.560 --> 01:39:55.140
there's rumors that fly around about everyone,
right?
I mean,

1638
01:39:55.470 --> 01:39:59.010
I constantly get messages on Twitter like,

1639
01:39:59.040 --> 01:40:03.970
oh your cause you have back acne or face acne,
you're fucking steroid use.

1640
01:40:03.971 --> 01:40:06.000
They're like,
you know,

1641
01:40:06.001 --> 01:40:10.300
I do testing willingly with Bj and I do,

1642
01:40:10.350 --> 01:40:15.150
I do vat for every fight.
If I could,
if my opponent would do it with me.

1643
01:40:15.600 --> 01:40:20.160
But you know,
rumors I guess.
Right.
Well there's a lot of experts out there.

1644
01:40:21.120 --> 01:40:24.560
Fake experts,
ignorance.
There's so much ignorance in there.

1645
01:40:24.610 --> 01:40:27.000
But you and me too.
I'm not,
I'm not,

1646
01:40:27.420 --> 01:40:32.310
I'm not super educated on it either because there's no point for me to be

1647
01:40:32.311 --> 01:40:34.440
educated on,
I don't want to take any part of it,

1648
01:40:34.441 --> 01:40:38.730
but I think it's bullshit that people are using it.
Well,
the,

1649
01:40:38.731 --> 01:40:42.240
for the longest time mean for how many years was it legal where you're allowed

1650
01:40:42.241 --> 01:40:45.090
to take testosterone?
I had no idea.

1651
01:40:45.210 --> 01:40:49.800
There were some guys that were guy that was 25.
He was 25.
And you know,

1652
01:40:49.820 --> 01:40:54.750
testosterone use exemption.
What the fuck is going on?

1653
01:40:54.940 --> 01:40:58.810
Why would you need that?
Well,
all you have to do is get a doctor that tells,

1654
01:40:58.870 --> 01:40:59.980
you know the commission,
hey,

1655
01:40:59.981 --> 01:41:03.340
this young man has a medical condition and all you'd have to do to get that

1656
01:41:03.341 --> 01:41:05.260
medical condition is take steroids.

1657
01:41:05.320 --> 01:41:09.640
You take steroids and then you get off of them and the consistent crashes,

1658
01:41:09.641 --> 01:41:13.030
your testosterone is low.
Then you get tested,
you have physical proof,

1659
01:41:13.031 --> 01:41:17.860
your testosterone is low.
The doctor who was probably unscrupulous says,

1660
01:41:17.890 --> 01:41:20.800
yeah,
this young man needs testosterone.
Yeah.
That's,
uh,

1661
01:41:22.300 --> 01:41:27.190
it's unfortunate because I,
you know,
martial arts shouldn't be a boat.

1662
01:41:27.670 --> 01:41:31.210
You know how physically strong you are,
superior you are to someone.

1663
01:41:31.211 --> 01:41:33.770
I think it should be about the technique and skill work.
Right.

1664
01:41:34.090 --> 01:41:36.550
That's why I started anyway.
I mean,

1665
01:41:37.090 --> 01:41:40.180
do you get like a special satisfaction of beating a guy who's physically

1666
01:41:40.181 --> 01:41:43.560
superior to you?
Like you said,
like Tyron Woodley big time,
man.
Well,

1667
01:41:43.940 --> 01:41:48.370
it naturally,
I'm not supposed to be better.
I shouldn't be able to kick his ass.

1668
01:41:48.670 --> 01:41:48.851
Well,

1669
01:41:48.851 --> 01:41:52.030
if you look now with the training and the martial arts that I've learned in the

1670
01:41:52.031 --> 01:41:56.230
skill that I spend my whole life working towards,

1671
01:41:56.440 --> 01:41:58.600
I'm able to do that.
I able to conquer that.

1672
01:41:58.900 --> 01:42:02.690
So it's a special piece of satisfaction for sure.
Yeah.

1673
01:42:02.730 --> 01:42:05.410
So if like if you took the average person who doesn't know anything about

1674
01:42:05.411 --> 01:42:08.680
martial arts and they looked at Woodley and they looked at you and they say,

1675
01:42:08.681 --> 01:42:12.730
all right,
who you betting on?
Everyone tells me,
everyone that tells me,
he's like,

1676
01:42:12.731 --> 01:42:16.480
I thought you were going to get fucking steamrolled by everyone,

1677
01:42:17.310 --> 01:42:21.130
but why wouldn't you?
And like,
uh,
like just like,
um,

1678
01:42:21.250 --> 01:42:25.150
family members that would like watch the highlight video.
They see my highlight.

1679
01:42:25.150 --> 01:42:30.150
I'm like jabbing people like maybe picking up slamming them or something is,

1680
01:42:30.570 --> 01:42:33.160
it's an impressive highly,
but you look at Tyrone's,

1681
01:42:33.161 --> 01:42:36.880
it's just like one shot Kaos everyone.

1682
01:42:36.881 --> 01:42:40.960
Like everyone is just sleeping,
getting knocked out.
He's an intimidating figure,

1683
01:42:40.961 --> 01:42:42.850
right?
Yeah.
He's a powerful dude.

1684
01:42:43.530 --> 01:42:47.500
Now there's certain styles and approaches when it comes to striking and

1685
01:42:47.501 --> 01:42:52.501
attacking and you are very technical in your approach.

1686
01:42:52.811 --> 01:42:57.350
Like do you have,
have to be,
but you have a knockout power though.
I mean you

1687
01:42:58.880 --> 01:43:01.020
mean you mean Stephanie is a tough motherfucker.

1688
01:43:01.030 --> 01:43:05.350
You I believe you're the first guy to ever stop them.
Yeah,
I have no idea.

1689
01:43:05.351 --> 01:43:10.240
I'm pretty sure you know.
So you are capable of doing it?
Yeah,
definitely.

1690
01:43:10.480 --> 01:43:13.930
But like when you hear guys,
like there was a,

1691
01:43:14.260 --> 01:43:18.430
there was a dude that I know that I read his Twitter once and he's a nice guy

1692
01:43:18.431 --> 01:43:21.070
but he's on his Twitter.

1693
01:43:21.070 --> 01:43:24.280
He wrote something like fuck technical striking,
you know,

1694
01:43:24.281 --> 01:43:27.160
just standing in the middle of the octagon and let it rip and worse.

1695
01:43:27.280 --> 01:43:31.230
What are you saying?
Hockey fight kind of I guess.
Yeah,
I mean I don't,

1696
01:43:31.560 --> 01:43:36.340
I mean it was,
the idea was just like test your Kona,
go mano a mile.

1697
01:43:36.910 --> 01:43:41.910
I'm a big fan of strategy and technique and technique fighting and that's one of

1698
01:43:42.041 --> 01:43:43.790
the reasons why I'm a big fan of you as you like,

1699
01:43:43.880 --> 01:43:47.690
you have a very intelligent approach to,
to find it.

1700
01:43:48.040 --> 01:43:52.250
Now when you,
when you fight a guy that is just a,
a bull

1701
01:43:52.260 --> 01:43:55.190
<v 2>rusher,
like not saying that Woodley doesn't have technique,</v>

1702
01:43:55.191 --> 01:43:58.430
but he will explode on you and it tries to finish shit with one shot,

1703
01:43:58.500 --> 01:44:01.820
tries to sprint things like,
do you,

1704
01:44:01.910 --> 01:44:05.360
do you have a specific strategy that you use for a guy like that?

1705
01:44:05.361 --> 01:44:06.740
Or do you just go with the flow?

1706
01:44:07.020 --> 01:44:12.020
<v 0>I go with the flow and I think that mastering the techniques that,</v>

1707
01:44:12.600 --> 01:44:15.720
that you need to use against a fighter like that,
it's important.

1708
01:44:15.721 --> 01:44:19.620
Not like thinking,
Oh I have to do this,
this and this against him.

1709
01:44:19.621 --> 01:44:24.621
I think just working techniques and every situation possible for a long period

1710
01:44:25.201 --> 01:44:27.390
of time,
you'll be able to,
uh,

1711
01:44:27.820 --> 01:44:31.230
you'll be able to apply it in this situation.

1712
01:44:32.070 --> 01:44:33.780
So I like to react.

1713
01:44:33.810 --> 01:44:37.620
Like I try not to think about too much about what my opponent's good at or what

1714
01:44:37.621 --> 01:44:41.410
he's going to do.
I just like to work on all different kinds of techniques,

1715
01:44:41.430 --> 01:44:45.690
master them and react to what's in front of me at that particular time.

1716
01:44:45.930 --> 01:44:49.160
<v 2>So when you're training for a garlic saf and then do you watch tape on him?
No,</v>

1717
01:44:49.570 --> 01:44:53.950
<v 0>I never watch anything.
I didn't watch JT.
I don't watch Tyrone.</v>

1718
01:44:53.951 --> 01:44:54.850
I didn't watch anyone.

1719
01:44:55.040 --> 01:44:58.100
<v 2>Wow.
Yeah.
That's interesting.
Why though?</v>

1720
01:44:58.850 --> 01:45:02.090
I don't find it beneficial to me at all.
That's fascinating.
Yeah.

1721
01:45:02.270 --> 01:45:06.260
But what if JT had some really bizarre attack he likes to do like you know,

1722
01:45:06.261 --> 01:45:08.990
cyborgs tornado guard or some shit like that.

1723
01:45:09.020 --> 01:45:10.670
You don't want to be aware of that at all?

1724
01:45:10.890 --> 01:45:15.890
<v 0>Well I think if I'm training what I w w all the techniques,</v>

1725
01:45:16.891 --> 01:45:19.020
I'm training it all the time.

1726
01:45:19.021 --> 01:45:23.010
I think if I master those I'll be able to overcome that.
You know?

1727
01:45:23.850 --> 01:45:24.560
I don't know how to

1728
01:45:24.560 --> 01:45:28.340
<v 2>played it exactly.
That's not a very good explanation.
Study tendencies.</v>

1729
01:45:28.341 --> 01:45:32.840
And it's a very big part of their game is studying tendencies and,

1730
01:45:33.110 --> 01:45:37.280
and finding openings to suffer.
Ross do that or does Donna her do that for you?

1731
01:45:37.920 --> 01:45:42.540
<v 0>No,
I just kind of,
you know,
I learned one technique at a time and I,</v>

1732
01:45:42.541 --> 01:45:46.470
Pete piece it together.
I think over the years and when you master it,

1733
01:45:46.471 --> 01:45:50.700
you able to just apply it in this situation.
You know,

1734
01:45:50.701 --> 01:45:53.700
you learned your defenses to certain moves,

1735
01:45:53.701 --> 01:45:57.180
but if that guy's really good at it or whatever,
you know,

1736
01:45:57.181 --> 01:45:59.700
you maybe work that defense a little more.

1737
01:46:00.600 --> 01:46:04.330
<v 2>Yeah.
Well that's why I'm surprised that you wouldn't like,
I'm not sure,</v>

1738
01:46:04.770 --> 01:46:07.860
<v 0>I'm not a believer in footage because you know,</v>

1739
01:46:08.700 --> 01:46:13.120
maybe my opponent will change,
you know,
I don't know.
I'm just not into it now.

1740
01:46:13.170 --> 01:46:17.190
I could fight a guy that's 600 pounds one day and a hundred pounds the next day.

1741
01:46:17.191 --> 01:46:21.570
I should be able to overcome any,
any style of fighter.

1742
01:46:22.340 --> 01:46:25.490
<v 2>That's fascinating.
So when you compete,</v>

1743
01:46:25.580 --> 01:46:30.410
you're essentially just putting all of your skill and martial arts knowledge on

1744
01:46:30.411 --> 01:46:33.770
the lawn and that's what you like about it.
Yeah,
yeah,
exactly.

1745
01:46:33.860 --> 01:46:35.330
That's a better description of it.

1746
01:46:35.960 --> 01:46:38.660
Did you always knew that you wanted to be an MMA fighter?

1747
01:46:39.300 --> 01:46:42.170
<v 0>Uh,
once they started training martial arts?
Yeah.
The first day I was,</v>

1748
01:46:42.340 --> 01:46:44.860
I was telling Area Hawaii and my last interview.
Yeah.

1749
01:46:44.980 --> 01:46:46.660
Pretty much my first day of martial arts thing.

1750
01:46:46.930 --> 01:46:50.370
<v 2>You just knew you're going to be a fighter.
Is there else that's ever attracted</v>

1751
01:46:50.370 --> 01:46:53.190
<v 0>you like that before?
Um,
yeah.
Hockey.</v>

1752
01:46:53.191 --> 01:46:57.100
I was really into hockey as a young kid and then I,
when I found martial arts,

1753
01:46:57.101 --> 01:47:01.410
I just dropped out of that.
That's an interesting thing about some fighters.

1754
01:47:01.750 --> 01:47:06.330
They're not into sports at all.
Yeah.
Because fights are so compelling.
Yeah.

1755
01:47:06.331 --> 01:47:08.400
It's takes over everything.

1756
01:47:08.530 --> 01:47:10.900
<v 2>Well,
so it's also so much on the line.</v>

1757
01:47:10.901 --> 01:47:15.430
It's so much crazier when you watch a alive UFC fight and you watched some

1758
01:47:15.431 --> 01:47:18.040
chaotic wild fucking fight.

1759
01:47:18.370 --> 01:47:22.180
It's just the amount of investment that you have in it.
The,
the,

1760
01:47:22.181 --> 01:47:26.260
the nerves and the excitement and the like,
just watching it,
just watching it.

1761
01:47:26.261 --> 01:47:28.150
It's so much more intense than any of this

1762
01:47:28.260 --> 01:47:32.970
<v 0>boarding your at.
Yeah.
Yeah,
for sure.
Everyone can understand it too.</v>

1763
01:47:33.360 --> 01:47:35.280
No one needs to know the rules or anything.

1764
01:47:35.281 --> 01:47:37.020
Everyone knows what's going on right away.

1765
01:47:37.380 --> 01:47:39.210
The only issue is when it goes to the ground,

1766
01:47:39.330 --> 01:47:42.330
like sometimes it goes to ground technical situations.
Yeah.

1767
01:47:42.360 --> 01:47:46.620
That's why you guess you find there's a lot of bullying and you know that the

1768
01:47:46.621 --> 01:47:50.610
technical striking is coming in.
A lot of people aren't enjoying that.

1769
01:47:51.330 --> 01:47:54.450
<v 2>Yes.
Yeah.
You're seeing it's like waves.</v>

1770
01:47:54.451 --> 01:47:58.800
It's really interesting how you see like there was the Mark Coleman wave with a

1771
01:47:58.801 --> 01:48:02.820
big powerful wrestlers were taking guys down on the ground and pounding and then

1772
01:48:02.821 --> 01:48:04.260
there was the kickboxer wave.

1773
01:48:04.261 --> 01:48:08.880
There's a Jujitsu wave and now it seems like it's so varied.
There's some,

1774
01:48:08.910 --> 01:48:13.050
there's so many different approaches and strategies going on now.
You know,

1775
01:48:13.080 --> 01:48:16.860
you're,
you're seeing wrestlers style and then you seeing like,
you know,

1776
01:48:16.861 --> 01:48:21.630
guys like Tj Dillashaw and Dominick Cruz that are accentuating the movement
more.

1777
01:48:22.010 --> 01:48:24.210
It's like so much more movement now.

1778
01:48:24.211 --> 01:48:26.430
Like if you watch Dominic's fight with me to [inaudible],

1779
01:48:26.910 --> 01:48:31.610
there's so much more movement angles in the,
just in that one round.
Yeah.

1780
01:48:31.710 --> 01:48:35.250
Giant right.
Movements giant.
Yeah.
I'm a big believer in it.
Well,

1781
01:48:35.270 --> 01:48:38.760
when you see guys that are flat footed and they have this very particular Moy

1782
01:48:38.760 --> 01:48:41.100
Thai style,
is that bum you out?
Is it like,

1783
01:48:41.480 --> 01:48:42.590
<v 0>doesn't bum me out.</v>

1784
01:48:42.591 --> 01:48:46.220
But I mean I used to fight like that did your longest time and when I fought

1785
01:48:46.221 --> 01:48:50.690
Carlos that was just like I have one direction,
it's straight forward,

1786
01:48:51.260 --> 01:48:53.480
I'm not going to go,
I'm not going to back up.
You know?

1787
01:48:54.050 --> 01:48:57.950
And then I kind of opened my mind to new things and yeah,

1788
01:48:58.100 --> 01:49:03.100
you have to be open minded and cause every opponent is going to give you a

1789
01:49:03.561 --> 01:49:07.220
different reaction,
you know,
it's going to require a different solution.

1790
01:49:08.560 --> 01:49:10.600
<v 2>Yeah.
I also,</v>

1791
01:49:10.601 --> 01:49:15.601
it's like there's something poetic about the ability to faint and you add in all

1792
01:49:16.511 --> 01:49:20.320
these variables when you add in movement that aren't there.

1793
01:49:20.470 --> 01:49:25.220
When a guy is like this flat footed approach,
like Conor Mcgregor and uh,

1794
01:49:25.310 --> 01:49:29.620
one of his interviews,
like this last post fight interview,
I asked him,
you know,

1795
01:49:29.621 --> 01:49:33.070
I said we was talking about poor Yay.
And I said,
you said he was basic,

1796
01:49:33.071 --> 01:49:36.730
like what did you,
what did you mean by that?
Yeah,
that's what he was saying.

1797
01:49:36.731 --> 01:49:40.780
He's like this,
this plotting Moy Thai style that everybody does.

1798
01:49:41.260 --> 01:49:44.830
And then you see Conor,
he opens up with like a,
a front leg hook kick.

1799
01:49:45.180 --> 01:49:48.030
Yeah he does a lot of wild.
Yeah.
I like his style.
It's

1800
01:49:48.030 --> 01:49:48.863
<v 3>super cool.</v>

1801
01:49:49.660 --> 01:49:54.520
His style and then his personality is like a weird combination,

1802
01:49:54.550 --> 01:49:57.280
you know,
like his style I think is very cool as well.

1803
01:49:57.550 --> 01:50:01.060
But like what do you think about a guy like that talks so much?
Shit.

1804
01:50:01.090 --> 01:50:05.230
It gets all this attention.
What do you think about that as you do?

1805
01:50:05.320 --> 01:50:10.210
You pretty much do the opposite,
but for some reason I kinda like it.
You like it,

1806
01:50:10.211 --> 01:50:13.450
but do you think see yourself emulating?
That was not me.

1807
01:50:13.530 --> 01:50:16.660
And I think he's being hip and I think that's so awesome.
You know,

1808
01:50:16.661 --> 01:50:19.760
he's able to go up there and he's able to uh,

1809
01:50:20.080 --> 01:50:23.740
express himself on the mic and in his fighting.
You know?
I think that's,
that's,

1810
01:50:23.770 --> 01:50:25.860
that's amazing.
I'm happy for him.
Right.

1811
01:50:25.930 --> 01:50:30.160
But I saw like I saw the influence of that in the Dennis Bermudez,

1812
01:50:30.161 --> 01:50:34.540
Ricardo Lamas fight,
cause they're in the same division right before the fight.

1813
01:50:34.540 --> 01:50:36.910
They were talking all this mad shit and like these guys,

1814
01:50:36.911 --> 01:50:38.710
because they want to do that,
they don't shout right.

1815
01:50:38.830 --> 01:50:42.670
Well they want the title shot attention and they also see also people can,

1816
01:50:42.671 --> 01:50:46.950
real people can recognize when people are forcing it and trying to be something

1817
01:50:46.990 --> 01:50:50.810
they're not.
It's the worst.
It's way better to do what you're doing with it.
Dude.

1818
01:50:50.840 --> 01:50:51.673
You be you.

1819
01:50:51.850 --> 01:50:56.850
And I think people will recognize what you're good at and recognize the special

1820
01:50:58.391 --> 01:51:01.450
things about yourself.
You know,
just be,
you.
Be beauty to the fullest.

1821
01:51:01.451 --> 01:51:05.440
I think Connor's great at that.
He's not shy.
He's just,

1822
01:51:05.590 --> 01:51:09.970
he's him and he's not scared about pissing people off or stepping over.

1823
01:51:09.971 --> 01:51:13.390
People ain't know he's doing this thing.
Yeah,
no,
he's,

1824
01:51:13.391 --> 01:51:15.020
he's definitely doing his thing.
He's a,

1825
01:51:15.370 --> 01:51:19.810
he's a freaky cat and a lot of ways the guys had four fights in the UFC and can

1826
01:51:19.811 --> 01:51:23.030
fill up a fucking soccer,
you know,
it's crazy,
right?
He can,
man,

1827
01:51:23.031 --> 01:51:24.310
if he fights in Ireland,

1828
01:51:24.520 --> 01:51:28.340
if he beats Dennis Seaver and his next fight is in Ireland against a big
fighter.

1829
01:51:28.350 --> 01:51:31.720
Well if it's all doe for the title in Ireland,

1830
01:51:32.240 --> 01:51:34.600
they might bite that whole country on fire.

1831
01:51:34.870 --> 01:51:39.260
They might literally smash every building and light the entire country and has

1832
01:51:39.270 --> 01:51:43.360
only been around for a little bit.
It's crazy for fight for fights in the UFC.

1833
01:51:43.390 --> 01:51:46.960
That's bizarre.
It's crazy.
Yeah.
It's no wrestlers though.

1834
01:51:47.050 --> 01:51:51.640
He has a fun any wrestlers.
Yeah.
He moves really well though.
So that's,

1835
01:51:51.710 --> 01:51:55.590
that's uh,
that'll be something,
you know,

1836
01:51:55.600 --> 01:51:58.810
wrestlers will have to overcome.
I want to see him versus Frankie Edgar.

1837
01:51:58.900 --> 01:52:01.150
That's what I was also good fun.
That's what I want for Christmas.

1838
01:52:01.600 --> 01:52:05.730
That's a great Frankie,
cause you're cranky moves so good too.
And he's his,

1839
01:52:05.750 --> 01:52:08.020
his uh,
penetration shot is so good.

1840
01:52:08.260 --> 01:52:11.770
He's so fucking relentless.
Yeah.
He's like,

1841
01:52:11.771 --> 01:52:14.710
we're so blown away by his fight with Cub Swanson.

1842
01:52:15.100 --> 01:52:20.100
I thought that was going to be a very difficult fight for both fighters and he

1843
01:52:20.711 --> 01:52:23.250
just overwhelmed them.
Yeah.
I like Frankie.
Yeah.

1844
01:52:23.440 --> 01:52:27.790
I love that fucking pace he puts on and you see that pace from the moment he

1845
01:52:27.791 --> 01:52:31.540
comes in,
he runs to the fucking octagon and he's just,

1846
01:52:31.541 --> 01:52:36.370
he's in that mindset like she's just going to start running when the energizer

1847
01:52:36.371 --> 01:52:41.260
bunny.
Yeah.
And he's a guy was notorious for training,

1848
01:52:41.261 --> 01:52:46.060
like a fucking wild,
notorious like doing press,
all that shit.

1849
01:52:46.060 --> 01:52:49.640
<v 2>Sneaking in workouts and wild,
you know,
energetic workouts.</v>

1850
01:52:49.641 --> 01:52:54.641
Also his coach Mark Henry's like very fucking diligent about notes and like

1851
01:52:54.860 --> 01:52:56.890
Brendan Schaub trained with him for awhile.
Okay.

1852
01:52:56.970 --> 01:53:01.340
They got fucking notes on everything.
Had page after page after page of notes,

1853
01:53:01.820 --> 01:53:02.091
you know,

1854
01:53:02.091 --> 01:53:05.780
and you see he's constantly working on things and constantly getting better.
I'm,

1855
01:53:05.800 --> 01:53:07.730
I'm,
I'm really impressed by Frankie.

1856
01:53:07.940 --> 01:53:11.600
I mean the Bj Penn fight was really impressive,
but I was,

1857
01:53:12.860 --> 01:53:17.720
I was skeptical about Bj going down to one 45 first of all.
I was like,
what is he

1858
01:53:18.200 --> 01:53:22.190
<v 0>the fight before they fought me,
right.
70.
What's this crazy fucking nuts?</v>

1859
01:53:22.520 --> 01:53:25.680
What is his,
what was it like fighting that guy like that?

1860
01:53:25.800 --> 01:53:28.770
That'd be a weird thing for you because you know he's in,
there wasn't,

1861
01:53:28.790 --> 01:53:31.130
it was weird because,
you know,

1862
01:53:31.131 --> 01:53:34.700
I watch Bj since I was a kid and I always love Bj.
I was like,
man,

1863
01:53:34.730 --> 01:53:38.930
this guy's so good.
You know?
He's so cool.
He's such a,
you know,
he's so raw,

1864
01:53:39.850 --> 01:53:43.520
right.
It's just hard nosed.
Just wants to get in there and fight anyone.

1865
01:53:43.550 --> 01:53:47.000
He fought Machida.
Yeah.
What the fuck and heavyweight.
He's a beef.

1866
01:53:47.030 --> 01:53:48.050
It was over two oh five.

1867
01:53:48.051 --> 01:53:51.440
So then technically at the same time he was talking so much shit about me and he

1868
01:53:51.450 --> 01:53:53.570
pissed me off and I just wanted to eat him alive.

1869
01:53:54.200 --> 01:53:57.320
So it was like a mixture of emotions when you heard

1870
01:53:57.340 --> 01:53:59.830
<v 2>him standing probably more than anybody ever did.</v>

1871
01:53:59.860 --> 01:54:03.940
You had them in a lot of trouble,
man.
Yeah,
I did it.
He,
he,
he's tough.

1872
01:54:03.941 --> 01:54:07.320
He wouldn't go down.
Didn't even know jock Whitney.
No.
He's tough as shit.
Yeah.

1873
01:54:07.420 --> 01:54:08.470
He's definitely tough as shit,

1874
01:54:08.471 --> 01:54:12.700
but it's hard to watch him take those kind of beatings,
you know?
Yeah,
yeah.

1875
01:54:12.760 --> 01:54:16.090
And then the Frankie Edgar beating after that.
It's,
it's hard because,

1876
01:54:17.170 --> 01:54:18.720
I mean I don't know who to believe.
You know,

1877
01:54:18.820 --> 01:54:23.500
you hear Mike Dolce Chase take on his camp and then you hear Bj's taken his
camp.

1878
01:54:23.501 --> 01:54:27.940
It's like I don't hear it.
I don't know.
But I know that Bj,

1879
01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:30.520
when he was with the marina bitches and he's doing a bunch of shit that he

1880
01:54:30.521 --> 01:54:34.270
didn't want to do right when he was a super uncomfortable and like constantly

1881
01:54:34.271 --> 01:54:34.630
sore.

1882
01:54:34.630 --> 01:54:38.200
But then you look at what the fuck he did the Diego Sanchez and you look at that

1883
01:54:38.201 --> 01:54:41.400
Bj,
the Sean Sherk Bj and he was a motherfucker.

1884
01:54:41.400 --> 01:54:45.910
He was a tank at one 55 and then this desire to go down to featherweight.

1885
01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:50.410
I just didn't understand it.
It's a bit weird.
Yeah.
Weird.
Yeah.

1886
01:54:50.411 --> 01:54:51.610
I don't know what it is.
You know,

1887
01:54:51.611 --> 01:54:56.611
just reinventing himself or trying to figure out one new thing.

1888
01:54:57.910 --> 01:54:58.570
Yeah,

1889
01:54:58.570 --> 01:55:03.570
it sucks to see a guy like that and the last bit of his career is well be hard

1890
01:55:04.151 --> 01:55:08.800
to deal with.
What do you think about Anderson Silva?
Like,
he's very skilled,

1891
01:55:09.430 --> 01:55:13.480
obviously love his movement.
But when you see him two losses in a row,

1892
01:55:13.780 --> 01:55:18.400
both kind of freaky.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Weidman though.
You know,
he's the real deal.

1893
01:55:18.610 --> 01:55:20.980
I knew why it was going to give them a hard fight.
I've trained,

1894
01:55:20.981 --> 01:55:24.880
I trained with Weidman here and there.
Yeah.
He's a tank.
This guy.
Yeah,

1895
01:55:24.881 --> 01:55:25.860
he's a beast.
Yeah.

1896
01:55:26.520 --> 01:55:29.800
Well he's a weird guy and he just took home a cheetah and I thought Machida

1897
01:55:29.801 --> 01:55:33.400
would be as hard as fight it that way.
Harder than then.
Uh,
and,

1898
01:55:33.560 --> 01:55:37.210
and he overcame it.
It was a difficult fight though.
I mean he got put in trouble.

1899
01:55:37.270 --> 01:55:40.640
He got put in trouble big time.
Yeah.
My cheat is a dangerous guy and,

1900
01:55:40.641 --> 01:55:44.070
but she does another guy who utilizes that strange,
you know,

1901
01:55:44.071 --> 01:55:47.490
Machida he'll incorporate more forward stance,

1902
01:55:47.700 --> 01:55:50.690
but he'll occasionally go completely sideways on you too.
Yeah.

1903
01:55:50.730 --> 01:55:55.110
He had that karate style.
I like to incorporate a lot of stuff.
He does too.
Yeah.

1904
01:55:55.250 --> 01:55:58.530
I've always been a fan of him.
He's excellent at that knee.

1905
01:55:58.531 --> 01:56:01.890
Check the knee check to the body catches guys coming in with that and to the

1906
01:56:01.891 --> 01:56:04.990
body.
He does,
but you don't know when it's coming.
Yeah.

1907
01:56:05.260 --> 01:56:08.430
Grown eight down defense to his,
his uh,
his,

1908
01:56:09.150 --> 01:56:13.220
his backwards movement to circle out that I like.
I like that.
Wait,

1909
01:56:13.230 --> 01:56:15.720
he did some sumo training too,
which is kind of interesting.

1910
01:56:15.720 --> 01:56:18.810
So he's really good at like popping his hips forward.
All right.

1911
01:56:18.870 --> 01:56:21.120
Circling away from things,
you know.

1912
01:56:21.121 --> 01:56:24.360
And he credits that a lot with his take down defense,

1913
01:56:24.720 --> 01:56:27.320
which you never think of sumo as like a,
um,

1914
01:56:27.450 --> 01:56:32.160
an applicable modern martial arts getting down in your squad at stance.
Right.

1915
01:56:33.150 --> 01:56:37.800
You're able to rotate faster.
I do that a lot too.
Do you ever use sumo,

1916
01:56:37.801 --> 01:56:42.720
your fuck around with it?
No,
but I'm like,
I've never actually trained sooner,

1917
01:56:43.200 --> 01:56:46.470
but I understand the concepts of what you're talking about and I do use that in

1918
01:56:46.471 --> 01:56:50.190
my wrestling.
I would like to train it just to wear one of those diapers.
Big Fun,

1919
01:56:50.230 --> 01:56:53.640
have some to try to wedge you.
The shit out of me dragged me out of the ground.

1920
01:56:53.670 --> 01:56:58.110
Uh,
I watched a while sumo match the other day cause I,
um,
you know,

1921
01:56:58.111 --> 01:57:01.510
I watch everything.
I'll watch amateur wrestling,
I'll watch her.

1922
01:57:01.800 --> 01:57:04.260
I'll watch karate point tournaments because I think there's something to be

1923
01:57:04.261 --> 01:57:07.950
learned in point fighting.
I think there's something about the approach,

1924
01:57:07.960 --> 01:57:12.510
the initial blitz approach of point fighting that a,
I forget his name,

1925
01:57:12.511 --> 01:57:13.231
but there's a guy,

1926
01:57:13.231 --> 01:57:17.340
an English guy who was fighting and Bella tour who's a really good point fighter

1927
01:57:17.670 --> 01:57:21.250
who is now starting to fight in MMA.
And there's the,

1928
01:57:21.510 --> 01:57:25.830
if you think about like the initial approach of the first strikes that are

1929
01:57:25.831 --> 01:57:29.970
landed and point fighting,
it's all about that initial approach.

1930
01:57:30.360 --> 01:57:34.530
Unrealistic in terms of like a continuous match or five minute round or

1931
01:57:34.531 --> 01:57:35.364
something like that.

1932
01:57:35.460 --> 01:57:39.600
But that skill of being able to blitz in and charge in,

1933
01:57:39.990 --> 01:57:44.700
it's very different.
Very unique.
Yeah.
Blitzing is a huge,
a huge factor.

1934
01:57:44.701 --> 01:57:48.690
I never made a lot of guys are really good at it.
Hendricks as a great blitz.

1935
01:57:49.410 --> 01:57:54.060
Uh,
Stephen Thompson,
one of the best.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,

1936
01:57:54.510 --> 01:57:56.700
yeah.
I think that that is,
um,
uh,

1937
01:57:56.820 --> 01:58:00.390
an area where we're going to see some guys make their,
uh,

1938
01:58:00.450 --> 01:58:02.940
make the transition over to,
uh,

1939
01:58:03.180 --> 01:58:07.020
to MMA that have that and that learn all those other aspects of MMA.

1940
01:58:07.200 --> 01:58:08.950
But it's hard for them.
The,

1941
01:58:09.020 --> 01:58:13.500
they probably have the hardest road in cause at least Moy Thai guys,

1942
01:58:13.560 --> 01:58:15.390
they're used to continuously fighting.

1943
01:58:15.510 --> 01:58:19.680
They used to taking shots and countering that used to overcoming obstacles,

1944
01:58:20.010 --> 01:58:22.680
whereas the karate guys,
it's also,

1945
01:58:22.950 --> 01:58:25.920
the stamina is not nearly as much of a requirement.

1946
01:58:25.921 --> 01:58:29.400
It's such a much more difficult thing to do and a grounded place for them to

1947
01:58:29.490 --> 01:58:32.310
grappling saw leg kicks are hard.
There's a lot,

1948
01:58:32.580 --> 01:58:36.450
but that blitz is undeniably effect.
That's just,

1949
01:58:36.451 --> 01:58:40.410
I think that you guys ever incorporate that and traits.
Oh yeah.
Do you do,

1950
01:58:40.411 --> 01:58:44.330
do drills for that or do you,
uh,
do you ever like deal point fighting?

1951
01:58:44.450 --> 01:58:49.250
<v 0>Yeah.
When Steven used to come up with a towel with George,
uh,
they,</v>

1952
01:58:49.270 --> 01:58:54.110
they showed a lot of his blitz style and,
and,
and how to do that.
So yeah,
we've,

1953
01:58:54.111 --> 01:58:56.330
we've taken some of their drills for that for sure.

1954
01:58:58.040 --> 01:58:59.330
<v 2>When you train for a fight,</v>

1955
01:58:59.360 --> 01:59:03.380
like say if a you have a neat week training camp and it starts out,

1956
01:59:03.560 --> 01:59:08.480
do you have like it's set up where like this type,
you know,
we'll like get,

1957
01:59:08.720 --> 01:59:11.990
we'll break things down during this period,
this period,

1958
01:59:11.991 --> 01:59:15.650
it'd be more like more of a buildup period.
And then like when do you taper off?

1959
01:59:15.710 --> 01:59:16.543
Yeah,

1960
01:59:16.660 --> 01:59:19.240
<v 0>everyone's kind of different.
Like,
uh,</v>

1961
01:59:20.650 --> 01:59:22.780
you're always excited when you first started camp,
right?

1962
01:59:22.781 --> 01:59:25.870
So it always starts explosive.
Then your body starts to break down.

1963
01:59:25.871 --> 01:59:30.410
So you need to be able to do a little bit shorter set sessions,
um,

1964
01:59:30.610 --> 01:59:33.340
like short but explosive.
So yeah,

1965
01:59:33.341 --> 01:59:36.400
there is periods of times where like farther away from the fight,

1966
01:59:36.401 --> 01:59:41.050
they're longer sessions but less explosive and intensive,

1967
01:59:41.350 --> 01:59:44.260
you know,
more technical approach and drilling and stuff.

1968
01:59:44.261 --> 01:59:46.990
And then the closer it gets,
the more time it cut down,

1969
01:59:47.230 --> 01:59:51.100
the more just like the hard sparring and work.
And then,
uh,

1970
01:59:51.310 --> 01:59:55.630
right before the fight,
um,
it's really short.
You know,

1971
01:59:55.631 --> 01:59:59.440
it's just,
it's just a short sparrings um,

1972
01:59:59.530 --> 02:00:03.430
the rolling sessions,
things like that.
Maybe some drilling and some pads,

1973
02:00:03.431 --> 02:00:06.310
but in between that,
but not long.

1974
02:00:07.180 --> 02:00:09.820
<v 2>Do you ever fuck around with cryotherapy if you'd done that yet?</v>

1975
02:00:10.090 --> 02:00:13.090
What's Cryo therapy again?
I know.
Oh,
that's another thing.
I might,

1976
02:00:13.210 --> 02:00:15.100
I might have done this.
I got to get you in there.

1977
02:00:15.520 --> 02:00:19.390
You go into this part of it 250 degrees below zero.
Yeah.

1978
02:00:19.450 --> 02:00:23.890
We put up a fake gun.
Your mouse,
did you?
Yeah,
I did this for my last fight.

1979
02:00:24.040 --> 02:00:27.700
Real uh,
yeah,
they uh,
at this,
at my osteo pass clinic,

1980
02:00:27.970 --> 02:00:30.520
they got one and I started using it yet.

1981
02:00:30.550 --> 02:00:35.440
Is it neck down or is it a full box back down?
Yeah.
You got to go the full body.

1982
02:00:35.920 --> 02:00:36.753
I've done both,

1983
02:00:37.060 --> 02:00:40.840
but the problem with the neck down one is they don't really get your upper

1984
02:00:40.841 --> 02:00:45.430
shoulders and your nap to squat down and hold my breath.
It's annoying.

1985
02:00:45.490 --> 02:00:48.200
It's annoying.
Yeah.
This one they have in la,

1986
02:00:48.220 --> 02:00:49.720
there's a couple of them across the country,

1987
02:00:49.721 --> 02:00:51.490
but the one they have in La is insane.

1988
02:00:51.970 --> 02:00:56.260
It's full body and I go there all the time.
I'll take you.
Okay.
It's amazing.

1989
02:00:56.320 --> 02:01:00.160
Okay guys.
Swear Eddie Bravo turned me onto it.
He fucking swears by it.

1990
02:01:00.161 --> 02:01:01.640
He goes several times a week.
Right.

1991
02:01:01.660 --> 02:01:05.170
And when he was training for the Hoya Gracie match,
he was going every day.

1992
02:01:05.210 --> 02:01:09.280
All right.
He said,
I couldn't do it without it.
He's like,
I need it to recover.

1993
02:01:09.330 --> 02:01:13.720
Yeah.
It really speeds things up.
My muscular soreness went way down.

1994
02:01:13.810 --> 02:01:14.870
It's amazing.
Yeah.

1995
02:01:14.920 --> 02:01:19.540
Like you could have like incredibly sore muscles from weightlifting or you know,

1996
02:01:19.570 --> 02:01:23.230
he'll sprints and shit like that and you go in there and it just floods it out

1997
02:01:23.231 --> 02:01:25.660
some way.
They explained it to me.
I'm not,

1998
02:01:25.780 --> 02:01:29.740
I can't scientifically explain what the details he tells us,

1999
02:01:29.741 --> 02:01:33.190
but somebody was telling me what,
what doesn't work and so I was like,
damn,

2000
02:01:33.191 --> 02:01:35.070
I an idiot and my fucking fallen for something.

2001
02:01:35.320 --> 02:01:38.020
But then I received both the science on it.

2002
02:01:38.230 --> 02:01:40.040
The science is a hundred legit because

2003
02:01:40.040 --> 02:01:41.690
<v 3>your body thinks it's fucking dying.</v>

2004
02:01:41.900 --> 02:01:46.010
You're going 250 degrees below zero for three minutes.
You're body's like,
oh,

2005
02:01:46.011 --> 02:01:47.270
we're fucked.
This is any,

2006
02:01:47.510 --> 02:01:51.200
your body tries to preserve itself by pulling all the blood into your internal

2007
02:01:51.201 --> 02:01:54.350
organs.
And then once you get out into room temperature,

2008
02:01:54.351 --> 02:01:59.351
it's just floods it back out and apparently there's like some intense anti

2009
02:01:59.361 --> 02:02:03.890
inflammatory response that comes out of that.
That was amazing for healing.

2010
02:02:04.160 --> 02:02:09.160
That is apparently the number one issue when it comes to injury and even disease

2011
02:02:09.350 --> 02:02:12.020
is inflammation,
right?
Yeah.

2012
02:02:12.050 --> 02:02:15.770
And they're saying that anti inflammatory responses,
um,

2013
02:02:15.890 --> 02:02:17.480
and anti-inflammatory,

2014
02:02:17.870 --> 02:02:22.770
like diets that don't promote inflammation like low sugar diets.

2015
02:02:22.820 --> 02:02:26.060
Apparently sugar is terrible for inflammation.

2016
02:02:26.450 --> 02:02:31.450
This was all discovered are all I'm a part of what that whole Regena keen thing

2017
02:02:33.111 --> 02:02:35.330
is all about.
I'm sure you've heard of that.

2018
02:02:35.331 --> 02:02:39.380
That's like what Weidman had done on his knees.
Dana white talked about it.

2019
02:02:39.381 --> 02:02:42.640
It's a blood spinning procedure.
They know about that.
Uh,

2020
02:02:42.830 --> 02:02:46.780
it's Kinda like that PRP,
but like more intense,
right?
Yes.

2021
02:02:47.030 --> 02:02:49.280
Dana told me about that.
Exactly.
It did.

2022
02:02:49.281 --> 02:02:52.400
Prp on my ankles digital because I had bad ankles last year.

2023
02:02:52.420 --> 02:02:57.010
They were fucked up from grappling or one was wrestling.

2024
02:02:57.020 --> 02:03:01.960
I tore my,
um,
my tendons before the Robbie Lawler fight.
Oh Wow.

2025
02:03:02.420 --> 02:03:06.980
After that fight,
I smashed up this one and I thought,

2026
02:03:06.981 --> 02:03:09.700
Damien Maia.
So Prp.

2027
02:03:09.701 --> 02:03:12.630
Lpt it though now like we see tore it,

2028
02:03:12.740 --> 02:03:16.160
tore it all the way through or partial tear.
I think it was a partial,

2029
02:03:16.370 --> 02:03:19.130
but it was like I couldn't like walk on it for how long?

2030
02:03:19.550 --> 02:03:23.000
Pretty much the whole camp.
Holy Shit.
How'd you get through camp?

2031
02:03:23.930 --> 02:03:28.850
Sucked it up.
Yeah.
The shit out of your uncle shit.
Yeah.
Uh,
yeah.

2032
02:03:28.851 --> 02:03:31.790
I had a brace and then I taped over the brace.
Wow.

2033
02:03:32.150 --> 02:03:36.860
Did you consider pulling out of the fight?
I should have probably.
Really?
Yeah,

2034
02:03:36.861 --> 02:03:38.300
but at that point in time,

2035
02:03:38.301 --> 02:03:41.030
like I had been like pulling out of every second fight.

2036
02:03:41.031 --> 02:03:44.600
It seemed like kind of injury,
you know?
It was like the Carlos fight,

2037
02:03:44.601 --> 02:03:48.380
the Bj Penn fight and then before that I had some other small,

2038
02:03:48.410 --> 02:03:53.000
before I was like less well known,
I had some other fights.
I was like,

2039
02:03:53.010 --> 02:03:55.340
I can't pull it to this fight.
You know,
it's too big.

2040
02:03:55.400 --> 02:03:57.320
Isn't that just a part of the game though?

2041
02:03:57.321 --> 02:03:59.560
I mean it seems like you just have to push through.
Yeah.

2042
02:03:59.860 --> 02:04:03.920
And a lot of fans don't recognize that because not a lot of people want to speak

2043
02:04:03.921 --> 02:04:07.580
about their excuses for Louisiana and stuff like that.
He's,

2044
02:04:07.910 --> 02:04:08.990
he's going to take it,
you know,

2045
02:04:09.320 --> 02:04:12.290
you're never going to be 100% as a fighter and he just have to,

2046
02:04:12.750 --> 02:04:13.760
you have to deal with that.

2047
02:04:14.020 --> 02:04:18.950
Just got to know what is okay to push through and what you need to like torn

2048
02:04:18.951 --> 02:04:19.580
ACL,

2049
02:04:19.580 --> 02:04:22.940
things along those lines where your knee gives out and has lost his stability.

2050
02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:27.390
Yeah.
I mean,
I could still stand up and throw punches and do take down.
So I mean,

2051
02:04:27.391 --> 02:04:31.120
I'm not,
I was still able to fight.
It was just painful.
Is that what it was?
Yeah.

2052
02:04:31.220 --> 02:04:33.980
Restricted certain things,
but I was still able to fight.

2053
02:04:34.280 --> 02:04:36.260
Now when you have like a,
an injury like that,

2054
02:04:36.261 --> 02:04:38.070
do you just figure out a to train around

2055
02:04:38.070 --> 02:04:38.903
<v 2>it,
do you?</v>

2056
02:04:39.240 --> 02:04:43.860
<v 0>Yeah.
Yeah.
Obviously the training is not going to be as good.
Right,
right.</v>

2057
02:04:44.030 --> 02:04:44.700
So,

2058
02:04:44.700 --> 02:04:48.390
so how do you compensate as far as like your conditioning because that's pretty

2059
02:04:48.391 --> 02:04:53.110
much rode a bike for the whole time.
Really?
Yeah.
A biker airdyne like,

2060
02:04:53.520 --> 02:04:58.200
yeah,
never done it.
And Yeah,
like a regular uh,
stationary bike.

2061
02:04:58.710 --> 02:05:02.220
Just doing sprints and yeah,
two bottles and she doesn't swim.

2062
02:05:02.221 --> 02:05:05.760
I couldn't do a lot of stuff.
I do,
I like to do a lot of agility work,

2063
02:05:06.420 --> 02:05:10.230
athletic agility and stuff and footwork and stuff and that I wasn't able to do

2064
02:05:10.231 --> 02:05:12.990
any of that.
I'll just say George got big into gymnastics.

2065
02:05:12.991 --> 02:05:15.750
Did you want up doing any of that as well?
I did it with them,

2066
02:05:15.810 --> 02:05:19.200
him and for us for awhile and I never got,

2067
02:05:19.560 --> 02:05:23.670
I never stayed with it.
I might start more later on,

2068
02:05:23.860 --> 02:05:26.440
like later on,
but um,

2069
02:05:26.820 --> 02:05:30.810
I felt it was more beneficial for me at that point in time to,

2070
02:05:31.530 --> 02:05:36.530
to work more with John Chamber rather than more the dynamic movement and stuff

2071
02:05:38.040 --> 02:05:41.130
and my,
my base wasn't there,
you know,
athletically.

2072
02:05:41.340 --> 02:05:44.810
<v 2>Right.
And Chamber is been your strength and conditioning coach for awhile.</v>

2073
02:05:44.880 --> 02:05:46.140
He does George as well.

2074
02:05:46.610 --> 02:05:51.190
<v 0>Well not anymore,
but yeah.
No,
I think George is kind of floats are he?</v>

2075
02:05:51.320 --> 02:05:53.780
George does a,
takes a similar approaches.
Me,

2076
02:05:53.781 --> 02:05:58.760
it's like if you're efficient in your movements and your skill work and your

2077
02:05:58.761 --> 02:06:03.530
technique,
he don't really have to be the most conditioned athlete,
you know?

2078
02:06:03.610 --> 02:06:04.443
Right.

2079
02:06:04.980 --> 02:06:09.540
<v 2>So that's more important than this just cardio and in my opinion,</v>

2080
02:06:09.541 --> 02:06:13.830
heart rate.
Yeah.
I mean because efficiency is huge.
Right?

2081
02:06:14.100 --> 02:06:18.420
And when you're efficient you,
you,
you put out less energy and it's easier.
Like,

2082
02:06:18.690 --> 02:06:21.600
have you seen a guy who like a really good boxer boxing guy doesn't know what

2083
02:06:21.601 --> 02:06:21.991
he's doing.

2084
02:06:21.991 --> 02:06:25.290
Like you're barely even breaks a sweat because he could just keep moving and

2085
02:06:25.291 --> 02:06:29.600
loose and your body's normal.
It's your body's used to doing it.

2086
02:06:29.690 --> 02:06:33.860
<v 0>Yeah.
Yeah.
That's,
that's my belief.
But there is,</v>

2087
02:06:34.190 --> 02:06:38.160
there is a factor of being well conditioned also.
Sure.
At that high,

2088
02:06:38.570 --> 02:06:42.530
high of a level when you have to efficient fighters,
you know,
at the,

2089
02:06:42.531 --> 02:06:45.020
at the highest level you need to be in good condition.

2090
02:06:45.290 --> 02:06:49.280
Have you ever had a find an altitude?
Um,
yeah.

2091
02:06:50.410 --> 02:06:54.020
It's Gallagher.
Is Calgary Calgary out to do it?
Maybe not sure.

2092
02:06:54.021 --> 02:06:58.400
I heard Calgary is and I fought there a couple times.
I'm not sure though.

2093
02:06:58.401 --> 02:07:01.710
I don't think anything like Denver thing,
like Mexico City was fucking for that.

2094
02:07:01.711 --> 02:07:05.160
US.
Oh yeah.
7,300 feet above sea level.
That's how it,

2095
02:07:05.170 --> 02:07:08.840
how feed about boulder were where people,
uh,
showing any,
oh yeah,

2096
02:07:09.030 --> 02:07:13.190
<v 2>yeah.
Hunted.
But hunt took the fight on three weeks notice.
Okay.
Reduce,</v>

2097
02:07:13.200 --> 02:07:16.320
had lived up there for a couple months.
Oh.
And trained up there,

2098
02:07:16.321 --> 02:07:20.460
but I mean hot struggled against Ben Rothwell in Denver,

2099
02:07:20.550 --> 02:07:25.410
which is 2000 feet lower.
So,
um,
tough fight for him,
you know,

2100
02:07:25.411 --> 02:07:28.110
take on three weeks notice.
And that is a tough fight.

2101
02:07:28.680 --> 02:07:31.620
Do you find yourself staying at one seven,
eight or do you think you'll move up?

2102
02:07:31.920 --> 02:07:33.150
You got to move up to one 85

2103
02:07:33.240 --> 02:07:36.010
<v 0>yeah.
Not because of half.
Do I've,
I've talked about it before.</v>

2104
02:07:36.011 --> 02:07:40.470
It's not because I have to,
uh,
it's just sort of curiosity and uh,

2105
02:07:40.660 --> 02:07:42.790
the experience to fight bigger guys,

2106
02:07:43.930 --> 02:07:46.600
but I want to do what I have to do it this division first.

2107
02:07:47.080 --> 02:07:51.550
So if you win the title at one 70,
yeah.
Then you move up.
Yeah.

2108
02:07:51.551 --> 02:07:55.750
I'll probably still fight at welterweight to yell back and forth.
Yeah.
Cause,

2109
02:07:55.751 --> 02:08:00.070
I mean it's easy for me to make welterweight.
I'll probably,

2110
02:08:00.280 --> 02:08:04.720
if I can,
if I could fight enough in the year and UFC is cool with it.

2111
02:08:05.630 --> 02:08:09.320
<v 3>So essentially for you,
your motivation is challenges.</v>

2112
02:08:09.350 --> 02:08:13.490
You want to keep things interesting and challenge herself.
Yeah.
Yeah,
for sure.

2113
02:08:13.520 --> 02:08:17.420
I want to overcome obstacles and test myself and find out who I really am.

2114
02:08:17.780 --> 02:08:21.170
Do you ever see yourself competing in straight kickboxing or more Thai?
Yeah,

2115
02:08:21.171 --> 02:08:25.340
I've thought about it maybe,
you know,
branching off and doing stuff like that.

2116
02:08:25.341 --> 02:08:27.950
Maybe a boxing fight eventually and stuff like that.

2117
02:08:27.951 --> 02:08:30.440
That would be probably pretty hard for the UFC to agree to though.
Yeah.

2118
02:08:30.441 --> 02:08:32.900
But who knows that that what point I'll do that.

2119
02:08:34.360 --> 02:08:34.990
<v 0>It won't be any</v>

2120
02:08:34.990 --> 02:08:38.620
<v 3>damn soon.
Yeah.
Cause rampage is talked about doing that recently.</v>

2121
02:08:38.650 --> 02:08:42.790
He's talked about just leaving MMA and Barbara.
Yeah,
I would never do that.

2122
02:08:42.850 --> 02:08:46.150
It would be like how I'm competing at Metamorris.
Yeah.

2123
02:08:46.151 --> 02:08:49.280
But I just don't see like the UFC ever letting you.
Yeah,

2124
02:08:49.330 --> 02:08:52.420
but maybe I won't be fine if I didn't have a name at that point.

2125
02:08:52.930 --> 02:08:57.220
Maybe I'll be 40 and so he'd be 40 and take on some more Thai fights.
Yeah.

2126
02:08:57.221 --> 02:09:01.090
Who knows?
Yeah.
So you're just a free spirit,

2127
02:09:01.580 --> 02:09:03.660
let going with the flow and,

2128
02:09:04.170 --> 02:09:08.420
<v 0>yeah.
Are you enjoying this life?
You've got a wild fucking life man.
Yeah,</v>

2129
02:09:08.430 --> 02:09:10.590
it's fine.
Sometimes it's boring as hell,

2130
02:09:10.591 --> 02:09:13.360
but what's boring is out of the monotony of training apps.

2131
02:09:14.370 --> 02:09:17.640
I like to just always be doing something.
That's her other thing.

2132
02:09:17.641 --> 02:09:21.540
My girlfriend has a hard time dealing with.
It's like I can't just sit here.

2133
02:09:21.780 --> 02:09:23.010
I have to be doing something.

2134
02:09:23.400 --> 02:09:26.040
Well that's gotta be what part of what makes you successful though?

2135
02:09:26.090 --> 02:09:29.910
Probably the fact that you have this constant drive.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I have a lot of,

2136
02:09:30.530 --> 02:09:31.590
a lot of drive for sure.

2137
02:09:31.700 --> 02:09:35.230
<v 3>Do you read any motivational shit or do you get motivated by anything?</v>

2138
02:09:35.550 --> 02:09:40.140
<v 0>No.
Oh,
I watch a lot of lot.
We'll watch a lot of stuff,
you know,</v>

2139
02:09:40.320 --> 02:09:44.640
footage and martial arts stuff that motivates me I guess,

2140
02:09:46.060 --> 02:09:49.300
<v 3>but nothing like,
you know,
art of war or any of that shit.</v>

2141
02:09:49.420 --> 02:09:53.950
I have an audio book of Sun Tzu.
Do you listen to it?
Yes,
I'm done.

2142
02:09:53.960 --> 02:09:57.760
On the way to training?
No,
not really.
Just kind of randomly.
Oh,
okay.

2143
02:09:57.950 --> 02:10:01.210
What about Musashi?
And you ever fuck around with a book of five rings?
No,

2144
02:10:01.360 --> 02:10:02.080
never heard of that.

2145
02:10:02.080 --> 02:10:06.910
I found it to be more applicable and a art of war,

2146
02:10:06.911 --> 02:10:09.700
the art of war,
all the strategy stuff.
I thought it was really interesting,

2147
02:10:09.701 --> 02:10:11.920
but it really is,
a lot of it is about actual warfare.

2148
02:10:12.320 --> 02:10:14.400
It's not not head to head combat.
Right.

2149
02:10:14.500 --> 02:10:19.500
Whereas Miyamoto Musashi was a Samurai and so a lot of his stuff was about one

2150
02:10:19.781 --> 02:10:24.781
on one competition and it was also rushy recognizing,

2151
02:10:24.940 --> 02:10:28.810
uh,
yeah,
he's,
this is who I have on my arm.
Oh yeah.
Okay.

2152
02:10:28.811 --> 02:10:32.260
I've seen this guy before.
He,
well he was this Great Samurai,

2153
02:10:33.050 --> 02:10:33.980
fought 62

2154
02:10:33.980 --> 02:10:37.610
<v 2>men and a one on one combat and killed them all.</v>

2155
02:10:37.940 --> 02:10:42.650
Just fucking swords.
He would,
he would get bored.
So he would,
uh,

2156
02:10:42.710 --> 02:10:45.500
take on people with wooden swords.
They would have a metal sword.

2157
02:10:45.540 --> 02:10:48.560
He would use a wooden one.
Yeah.

2158
02:10:48.590 --> 02:10:53.480
He killed a guy with an or fantasy or is oh,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.

2159
02:10:53.900 --> 02:10:58.820
Arrow is this,
I believe it was a 14 hundreds.
Wow.
Yeah.
He,

2160
02:10:58.821 --> 02:11:02.930
um,
this patient would kill them.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
He killed everybody.
Go written.

2161
02:11:02.931 --> 02:11:03.920
No show.

2162
02:11:06.620 --> 02:11:09.920
You show up with a sword and he beats you over the head with a fucking,

2163
02:11:09.921 --> 02:11:14.260
or he would,
he would widdle the oars down.
I want to say,

2164
02:11:14.290 --> 02:11:15.410
what year was that?

2165
02:11:16.850 --> 02:11:21.590
I want to say it was the 14 hundreds.
Let's see.
Tim Won't do such.

2166
02:11:21.610 --> 02:11:24.700
She,
it was um,

2167
02:11:25.010 --> 02:11:27.650
1584.
Yeah.

2168
02:11:27.651 --> 02:11:32.630
He died in 1645.
How he was,

2169
02:11:32.631 --> 02:11:34.670
I'm 61 years old.

2170
02:11:34.880 --> 02:11:38.870
Natural causes probably stomach cancer.
They're saying,
hmm.

2171
02:11:39.110 --> 02:11:40.970
I wonder why it says that.
Yeah.

2172
02:11:41.600 --> 02:11:44.810
But his book is fascinating because he was really into,

2173
02:11:45.110 --> 02:11:48.710
a big part of his philosophy was about staying balanced,

2174
02:11:49.200 --> 02:11:51.200
about keeping the mind bounce.
Cause you know,

2175
02:11:51.230 --> 02:11:56.230
sword fighting such a fucking unbelievably intense and stressful scenario that

2176
02:11:57.080 --> 02:12:02.080
he was all about balancing out your life with art and philosophy and poetry and

2177
02:12:02.990 --> 02:12:05.090
even calligraphy.
I mean,

2178
02:12:05.091 --> 02:12:09.920
it wasn't about just being this brute and it was all about balancing the mind so

2179
02:12:09.921 --> 02:12:13.910
that there was no extraneous stress.
There's all,

2180
02:12:14.030 --> 02:12:17.600
everything was about that,
the technique being cleaned,

2181
02:12:17.601 --> 02:12:21.870
the mind being sharp and makes us that everything was completely bad.

2182
02:12:21.871 --> 02:12:23.070
And he's a fascinating guy,

2183
02:12:23.930 --> 02:12:27.680
<v 0>I believe in balance in your life to,
I'd like to read that.</v>

2184
02:12:27.710 --> 02:12:31.710
Do you have hobbies other than that?
I'm in main,
uh,
I like hunting.
Uh,

2185
02:12:31.750 --> 02:12:35.270
I've just got into that.
I just got my hunting license this year.
Just this year.

2186
02:12:35.680 --> 02:12:40.410
Where,
where have you hunted?
Uh,
well I just went,
um,

2187
02:12:40.730 --> 02:12:45.080
up in BC.
Well,
where would Eric,
Princeton,

2188
02:12:45.950 --> 02:12:50.390
yeah,
Princeton area up just to get anything.
He got a rabbit.

2189
02:12:51.040 --> 02:12:55.850
That's it.
Yeah.
Is that the first time you've hunted a,
as an adult?
Yeah,
as a kid.

2190
02:12:55.851 --> 02:12:59.780
My Dad and my grandpa always took me and my brother out,
but uh,
you know,

2191
02:12:59.781 --> 02:13:03.830
as an adult,
this is,
this was like the first time I've had an opportunity,

2192
02:13:03.831 --> 02:13:06.290
but I'm going to go a lot next year.
Um,

2193
02:13:06.860 --> 02:13:10.640
I got a lot of friends that go like elk hunting and stuff and that's all.

2194
02:13:10.940 --> 02:13:14.540
I've got a few different offers from some friends that want to take me out in

2195
02:13:14.541 --> 02:13:15.950
some trips.
It's going to be amazing.

2196
02:13:16.010 --> 02:13:17.810
Well that's the cool thing about being a famous person.

2197
02:13:17.811 --> 02:13:19.580
As soon as people find out that you're into hunting,

2198
02:13:19.600 --> 02:13:24.200
like I want to go hunt with Roy.
Yeah.
Oh that'll definitely happen.
Yeah.

2199
02:13:24.201 --> 02:13:28.550
I got some buddies that are really big into it.
So a lot of UFC fighters.
Yeah.

2200
02:13:28.840 --> 02:13:32.220
Chatman was,
he killed his first elk this year with a bow.

2201
02:13:32.430 --> 02:13:34.860
<v 3>He killed the deer to um,
TJ.</v>

2202
02:13:34.890 --> 02:13:39.090
Tj killed a huge fucking bear last year and uh,

2203
02:13:39.120 --> 02:13:42.720
put it on social media and everybody got angry at him.
Did he eat it in the bear?

2204
02:13:42.721 --> 02:13:45.300
Yeah.
Yeah.
People are fucking crazy.

2205
02:13:45.690 --> 02:13:49.050
They think you're killing booboo when that he's in the middle of taking picnic

2206
02:13:49.051 --> 02:13:52.200
baskets and speaking English and he went up and fucking murdered them.

2207
02:13:52.260 --> 02:13:55.650
They don't understand balance and ecosystem and all that stuff.

2208
02:13:55.651 --> 02:13:58.140
So you got to educate themselves before.
Yeah.

2209
02:13:58.170 --> 02:14:00.450
Well there's a lot of convenience and they're thinking too.

2210
02:14:00.510 --> 02:14:04.310
I mean it's just so easy to just look at someone.
You mean?
I had a guy got,
it,

2211
02:14:04.320 --> 02:14:07.230
got upset with me cause I shot a bear and he was wearing leather shoes.

2212
02:14:07.260 --> 02:14:08.700
I had this conversation with them,
the more,

2213
02:14:08.840 --> 02:14:12.900
you know how crazy this conversation is.
So ignorant,
man.
Yeah.
And,

2214
02:14:12.960 --> 02:14:16.440
and a lot of them think it's cruel.
It's like,

2215
02:14:16.860 --> 02:14:19.530
but the meat you're eating at the supermarket,
do you know,
cruel.

2216
02:14:19.531 --> 02:14:22.140
They're treating those animals.
It gets insane.

2217
02:14:22.350 --> 02:14:26.940
What's also the getting upset at someone for hunting when you're driving by

2218
02:14:26.970 --> 02:14:31.890
restaurants left and right.
You know,
it was fast food,
joints,

2219
02:14:31.950 --> 02:14:32.970
supermarkets.

2220
02:14:33.300 --> 02:14:37.530
I'm pretty much every crowded street that you drive down everywhere you look,

2221
02:14:37.590 --> 02:14:39.660
there's animals that have been killed.
It's just,

2222
02:14:39.690 --> 02:14:43.650
it's a ridiculous thing to concentrate on a hunter who takes it in the most

2223
02:14:43.710 --> 02:14:48.540
natural look of education,
maybe.
Well,
insulation,
it's a lot of it,

2224
02:14:48.570 --> 02:14:50.070
you know?
I mean,
there's ignorance.

2225
02:14:50.071 --> 02:14:53.940
I'm sure you deal with a parallel or similar kind of an ignorance when it comes

2226
02:14:53.941 --> 02:14:57.120
to fighting.
Because when you tell people that you're a fighter,

2227
02:14:57.121 --> 02:15:01.080
they probably assume you're some thuggish asshole and you're like,
wait a minute,

2228
02:15:01.081 --> 02:15:03.540
this guy is like,
so like even keeled.

2229
02:15:03.541 --> 02:15:08.541
I don't do you get that sometimes where people like they don't understand why

2230
02:15:08.551 --> 02:15:13.350
you are so calm and normal,
but yet you're,
yeah.
Elite world class fighter.

2231
02:15:13.770 --> 02:15:17.970
Yeah,
I guess so.
Yeah.
There's some situations.
Yeah,
they don't,
they're like,

2232
02:15:17.971 --> 02:15:22.700
it's kind of a counterintuitive.
Yeah,
yeah,
exactly.
Yeah.
Do you,

2233
02:15:22.710 --> 02:15:25.830
do you ever have people like judge you because of the fact that you're a fighter

2234
02:15:25.831 --> 02:15:30.510
or not so much?
Most of the people in the,
now it's super popular,
right?

2235
02:15:30.900 --> 02:15:34.350
I call it's cool what,
seven years ago probably wasn't so much.
Oh yeah,

2236
02:15:34.351 --> 02:15:38.760
when I was like 14 yeah.
It was that like,
they're like,

2237
02:15:38.761 --> 02:15:42.750
why are you doing this?
Go to school,
get a real job.
You know,

2238
02:15:42.751 --> 02:15:45.840
like you're never going to make any money.
I'm like,
I bet you I probably will.

2239
02:15:45.960 --> 02:15:48.690
I'll make more money doing this.
Then you know,

2240
02:15:48.691 --> 02:15:50.160
working in construction or something.

2241
02:15:50.310 --> 02:15:53.940
Well now people realize that it's a viable option then it wasn't,

2242
02:15:54.330 --> 02:15:57.000
it wasn't popular.
It is kind of a crazy thing.

2243
02:15:57.000 --> 02:16:01.080
If you think about people that entered into it when it wasn't very profitable,

2244
02:16:01.290 --> 02:16:05.130
like boy,
you have to really love it.
Yeah.
Those guys.
I'm so,

2245
02:16:05.340 --> 02:16:09.250
so like thankful for like the Gracies and the guys in the first UFC.

2246
02:16:10.520 --> 02:16:14.090
You know Randy,
Tito,
all these guys,
Dan Henderson still,

2247
02:16:15.150 --> 02:16:18.120
he's still at it,
man.
That guys fighting Moose Aussie,

2248
02:16:18.180 --> 02:16:21.180
he doesn't get enough credit.
This guy,
oh,
it's a fucking animal.

2249
02:16:21.181 --> 02:16:23.370
It's one of the toughest guys that's ever walked the face of the planet,

2250
02:16:23.940 --> 02:16:26.520
you know,
and these last fight with [inaudible],
you know,

2251
02:16:26.820 --> 02:16:30.070
but kind of like basically two or three weight classes are bigger

2252
02:16:30.070 --> 02:16:34.360
<v 2>than him.
General ragdolled yeah,
yeah.
It's crazy.</v>

2253
02:16:34.750 --> 02:16:38.890
It was so important for those guys to have that passion to pursue this and those

2254
02:16:38.891 --> 02:16:43.870
guys really should be heralded as the,
the true pioneers.
They were,

2255
02:16:44.100 --> 02:16:45.270
you know,
even though hoists Gracie,

2256
02:16:45.271 --> 02:16:47.500
he says a bunch of crazy shit today and like you said,

2257
02:16:47.501 --> 02:16:50.710
a bunch of crazy shit about Eddie Bravo's,
my best friend.

2258
02:16:51.160 --> 02:16:54.280
I still have nothing but love and respect for that guy because if it wasn't for

2259
02:16:54.281 --> 02:16:58.030
Royce Gracie,
I would have never done Jujitsu.
I would never know when it was,

2260
02:16:58.060 --> 02:17:02.170
if that guy didn't have the balls to step in there and fight guys like Dan

2261
02:17:02.171 --> 02:17:04.840
savage.
And you see him catch a guy on a triangle and you're like,

2262
02:17:04.841 --> 02:17:06.250
what the fuck just happened?

2263
02:17:06.251 --> 02:17:10.660
Like that opened my eyes so much to what martial arts,

2264
02:17:11.110 --> 02:17:16.060
you know what the real potential for martial arts could be and we've seen

2265
02:17:16.061 --> 02:17:19.630
martial arts evolves so much,
just enough.
A couple of decades.

2266
02:17:19.870 --> 02:17:22.990
20 years more than over the last thousand years.

2267
02:17:23.290 --> 02:17:26.710
It's crazy that the amount it's changed.
Yeah.

2268
02:17:26.711 --> 02:17:30.670
I mean I was competing in the 80s man and nobody knew anything.

2269
02:17:30.700 --> 02:17:33.380
Everybody thought that if somebody tried to wrestle you,

2270
02:17:33.381 --> 02:17:35.620
you just fucking catch him with a punch and knock 'em out.

2271
02:17:36.180 --> 02:17:38.230
But I thought they would just head kick people.

2272
02:17:38.231 --> 02:17:41.230
They were on the way that he didn't realize how easy it would be.

2273
02:17:41.430 --> 02:17:44.460
A few to get smashed.
Like nobody had an idea.

2274
02:17:44.650 --> 02:17:49.210
I love talking to like back in the day,
like my old kickboxing coach and stuff,

2275
02:17:49.270 --> 02:17:54.070
like just just name in the head.
Yeah.
I had a boxing coach that would say,
man,

2276
02:17:54.100 --> 02:17:57.640
anybody tries to take me down a sidestep of a cup.
There's this whole thing,

2277
02:17:57.760 --> 02:18:01.660
sidestep upper cut.
And I'm like,
yeah,
what if they're shooting at your legs?

2278
02:18:01.730 --> 02:18:04.420
How low are you going to go?
Bad idea.
But

2279
02:18:06.190 --> 02:18:10.090
making it practical is it whole thing?
Yeah.
I,

2280
02:18:10.091 --> 02:18:12.910
this one dude was explaining to me that he didn't need to learn martial arts

2281
02:18:12.911 --> 02:18:17.070
cause man,
you know what I'd do?
I kick somebody fucking new out.
Like,
hmm.

2282
02:18:17.250 --> 02:18:18.640
I mean I'm going to show you some fights.

2283
02:18:18.980 --> 02:18:21.730
One show you Alistair Overeem versus Ben Rothwell.

2284
02:18:22.570 --> 02:18:26.410
That knee kick thing doesn't really work that well all the time and it's not

2285
02:18:26.411 --> 02:18:31.411
gonna be amazed how durable your knee is and how many shots to the leg your knee

2286
02:18:32.221 --> 02:18:35.600
can kick.
Do you fuck around with that will bleed kick?
Do you do that thing?
Uh,

2287
02:18:35.660 --> 02:18:40.430
the,
the sideway,
yeah.
That's a,

2288
02:18:40.431 --> 02:18:43.840
a kick that's kind of made a comeback over the last few years,

2289
02:18:44.160 --> 02:18:45.580
Greg Jackson guys do it.
Yeah,

2290
02:18:45.581 --> 02:18:48.920
because you used to see that and those old like wing Chung books,
you know,

2291
02:18:49.300 --> 02:18:52.900
they would throw a lot that weird kick and I was like,
Ooh,
that's a goofy kick.

2292
02:18:53.180 --> 02:18:57.070
But then,
but you see like Carlos condit likes to do it a lot.

2293
02:18:57.100 --> 02:19:00.640
Jon Jones likes to do it a lot.
It's a good kick.
If you,

2294
02:19:00.790 --> 02:19:01.990
if you learn it correctly,

2295
02:19:02.150 --> 02:19:07.150
Jones is effectively with his other strikes to waist size down and then pup up.

2296
02:19:07.450 --> 02:19:11.560
He's so fucking tall too.
That's such a huge advantage.
Yeah.

2297
02:19:11.710 --> 02:19:16.360
I haven't played with it,
you know,
but I don't rule it out.
Yeah,
no,

2298
02:19:16.361 --> 02:19:20.520
I think it's a really excellent kick.
I like that comes from the same angle,

2299
02:19:20.530 --> 02:19:25.500
but it's a head kick.
[inaudible]
crescent or they're crossing care?
No,

2300
02:19:25.660 --> 02:19:30.440
it's like it goes up to the,
you know how like,
I do like this front kick,

2301
02:19:30.930 --> 02:19:33.050
you know what you do with the heel,
you know,

2302
02:19:33.051 --> 02:19:37.300
he just come up on that side with,
oh,

2303
02:19:37.310 --> 02:19:40.490
I see what you're saying.
It's kind of a weird kick.
So you're kind of,

2304
02:19:40.491 --> 02:19:43.340
it's like a Mr action sort of a thing.
Like they think it's coming and you just,

2305
02:19:43.610 --> 02:19:47.510
yeah,
it goes like it's your back leg,
so it comes up this way,

2306
02:19:47.511 --> 02:19:51.980
but it ends up like,
oh,
I mean I've had a weird angle.
Yeah.
Like a C,

2307
02:19:52.460 --> 02:19:56.900
right?
Yeah.
Hmm.
Oh,
sort of the opposite maybe of the question mark.
Kick.

2308
02:19:57.080 --> 02:20:00.200
It's the exact opposite.
Yeah,
I love that question mark.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2309
02:20:00.201 --> 02:20:04.640
It's been such a,
you know,
Brazilian kick for some people like,
um,
what was it?

2310
02:20:04.641 --> 02:20:08.150
Globby fake Tosa.
Famous though is a piece of that.
God Damn.

2311
02:20:08.151 --> 02:20:12.710
He and he used to bring it down.
He was so way out.

2312
02:20:13.670 --> 02:20:17.210
Oh my God.
There's some amazing photos of him doing that on mine.

2313
02:20:17.240 --> 02:20:20.630
That's a classic [inaudible] technique.
And Taekwondo,
it's,

2314
02:20:20.631 --> 02:20:23.210
well that's where I learned to talk window guys used to do it,

2315
02:20:23.420 --> 02:20:25.010
but before they used to call it the Brazilian kick,

2316
02:20:25.011 --> 02:20:28.790
it was always known as a question mark.
Yeah.
That's such last kick.
Yeah.

2317
02:20:29.510 --> 02:20:31.520
We used to call it fake front kick.
Round kick.

2318
02:20:31.790 --> 02:20:36.390
That's what we used to call it and talk window.
But you know,
but that uh,
this,

2319
02:20:36.650 --> 02:20:38.870
this idea of Ms Direction,

2320
02:20:39.050 --> 02:20:42.370
like you see it saw often too with wrestling.
We're guys,

2321
02:20:42.390 --> 02:20:45.800
we'll fake a shot and then land a punch and stead,
you know,

2322
02:20:45.801 --> 02:20:50.150
there's so much misdirection and fighting to try it.
Yeah.
Faints,
faints or giant.

2323
02:20:50.360 --> 02:20:54.950
When you see guys that don't faint and guys that just plow forward with no,

2324
02:20:55.040 --> 02:20:57.200
no miss direction,
no fainting whatsoever.

2325
02:20:57.410 --> 02:21:01.550
One of the most successful guys as George.
Yes.
Yeah,
very much so.

2326
02:21:01.551 --> 02:21:04.610
George was great and it still is at,

2327
02:21:04.790 --> 02:21:07.250
you never knew what the fuck he was going to do.
It's crazy.

2328
02:21:07.251 --> 02:21:10.220
If people would just be like locked up,
like I don't know if he's going to shoot,

2329
02:21:10.221 --> 02:21:14.010
he's going to jab me.
Uh,
he's going to kick me like,
yeah.
Yeah.

2330
02:21:14.510 --> 02:21:19.510
George was also great at utilizing the momentum that he got up to being a champ

2331
02:21:20.480 --> 02:21:21.800
and just carrying that forward.

2332
02:21:21.801 --> 02:21:26.510
He was so comfortable with the experience of fighting in a high profile bout

2333
02:21:26.690 --> 02:21:28.760
that you would see guys that were fighting them,

2334
02:21:28.761 --> 02:21:32.060
that we're just so caught up in the bright lights in the moment and then womb,

2335
02:21:32.090 --> 02:21:35.370
he's taking them down.
Uhm,
he's dropping elbows on him.
Boom.
You know,
it was just,

2336
02:21:35.630 --> 02:21:38.170
he was relentless,
relentless.

2337
02:21:38.390 --> 02:21:41.510
One of the greatest martial arts martial artist that ever lived ever.

2338
02:21:41.540 --> 02:21:45.980
My pepper and a great representative of martial arts too.

2339
02:21:45.981 --> 02:21:49.820
Cause he was such a good guy.
And this is such a good guy.
Spoke really well.
Yeah.

2340
02:21:50.680 --> 02:21:54.220
Yeah.
I'm happy that he got out when he did and you know,

2341
02:21:54.410 --> 02:21:58.670
selfishly in some ways I hope he stays out because uh,

2342
02:21:59.720 --> 02:22:02.870
I think it,
I think he still has it in him though.
I think he does too.

2343
02:22:02.871 --> 02:22:06.800
But that's what I worry about.
I hate seeing a guy stay too long.

2344
02:22:06.920 --> 02:22:11.920
Like the thing that bugs me more than anything is talking to guys that had been

2345
02:22:12.980 --> 02:22:17.420
in fights for,
you know,
or in,
in MMA for a long time.

2346
02:22:17.421 --> 02:22:21.140
And I see the deterioration that that's hard to watch.

2347
02:22:21.740 --> 02:22:26.010
I think if he's patient with it this time,
you what this,
this knee

2348
02:22:26.010 --> 02:22:31.010
<v 0>surgery coming back slowly enjoying the training and then maybe a year or two</v>

2349
02:22:31.591 --> 02:22:36.591
years down the road and then he has that he's back to where he was or you know,

2350
02:22:37.381 --> 02:22:39.960
where he needs to be.
Could be interesting.

2351
02:22:40.350 --> 02:22:43.350
Well it certainly could be interesting cause he'll be having fun with it again.

2352
02:22:43.890 --> 02:22:47.070
For the longest time,
I know George wasn't having fun with fighting.
Right.

2353
02:22:47.220 --> 02:22:50.370
He's doing it because it was pressure and this and that.
All right.
Well,

2354
02:22:50.371 --> 02:22:52.590
he was up to that incredibly high level too,

2355
02:22:52.800 --> 02:22:54.210
where he's making so much fucking money.

2356
02:22:54.211 --> 02:22:57.270
I mean he's making more money than anybody who's paper views were so high.

2357
02:22:57.271 --> 02:23:00.300
He's doing really well.
And he had endorsements and again,

2358
02:23:00.301 --> 02:23:05.220
he's such a great representative that people would like scramble to have him

2359
02:23:05.221 --> 02:23:09.030
sponsor their product.
It's a sponsor him rather.
Right.
But I,

2360
02:23:09.150 --> 02:23:13.560
I just think that there's a certain amount of punishment you can take any career

2361
02:23:14.040 --> 02:23:18.300
and then past that,
you know,
there's,
there's a point of no return,

2362
02:23:18.840 --> 02:23:23.700
you know,
and I worry about that cause he's so well spoken.
It's such a good guy.

2363
02:23:24.120 --> 02:23:27.180
I worry about guys getting to that point of no return.

2364
02:23:28.050 --> 02:23:31.350
Is that something that ever comes into your mind?
No,

2365
02:23:32.990 --> 02:23:33.870
it doesn't bother me.

2366
02:23:33.930 --> 02:23:37.980
But when you see like these studies on traumatic brain injuries in the NFL

2367
02:23:37.981 --> 02:23:41.700
players and yeah,
I'm not an NFL player or even in fighters.

2368
02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:43.740
You hear about an fighters as well.
Yeah.

2369
02:23:43.770 --> 02:23:48.180
I think it also has to do with some certain styles of fighters though.
I think,

2370
02:23:48.210 --> 02:23:52.890
uh,
guys like me take a lot less damage with,

2371
02:23:52.980 --> 02:23:56.940
um,
if I felt like I did against Carlos and all my fights,

2372
02:23:57.090 --> 02:24:01.470
I'd have a short career and then I'd probably have to be concerned with some

2373
02:24:01.740 --> 02:24:04.770
effects down the road.
Like Forrest Griffin style,

2374
02:24:05.130 --> 02:24:06.810
Forrest Griffin versus Stephan Bonner.

2375
02:24:06.840 --> 02:24:10.440
If you look at my fights are the statistics on my phone,
I don't get hit much.

2376
02:24:10.560 --> 02:24:15.070
Right.
You know,
so it's,
it's not a huge issue for me.
Well,

2377
02:24:15.071 --> 02:24:17.250
you're good defensively when you do get hit too.

2378
02:24:17.251 --> 02:24:20.340
Like you were one of the few guys like Robbie tagged you,

2379
02:24:20.550 --> 02:24:24.680
but you figured out a way to maintain your cool.
Yeah.
Stay calm.
Yeah.

2380
02:24:25.590 --> 02:24:30.120
Who's that the most you were hurt in a modern fight.
Yeah.
Yeah,

2381
02:24:30.150 --> 02:24:34.140
I was okay though.
You know,
I wasn't,
uh,
I,
I,

2382
02:24:34.240 --> 02:24:38.340
I was definitely hurt.
Like the shot bang gave me like a,

2383
02:24:39.030 --> 02:24:41.760
you know,
my eyes went back or whatever and I fell on,

2384
02:24:41.761 --> 02:24:46.050
but I remember I was thinking clue clearly through the whole thing.

2385
02:24:46.590 --> 02:24:50.820
And I remember my legs being so tired at that point of the fight that I just

2386
02:24:50.821 --> 02:24:55.740
needed to go down.
You know,
so I think,
I think actually,

2387
02:24:56.010 --> 02:24:58.740
um,
uh,
the more scrap,

2388
02:24:58.770 --> 02:25:01.980
the a bigger hit for me was the Carlos condit fight.

2389
02:25:02.280 --> 02:25:05.940
He hit me in the temple and the top of the head and I was just like,

2390
02:25:05.941 --> 02:25:07.110
so scrambled man.

2391
02:25:08.410 --> 02:25:12.060
It's weird how different spots in your head we'll do that isn't it?
Yeah.
Yeah.

2392
02:25:12.061 --> 02:25:16.170
The side of the head to is really good.
The temple,
I like to target that area.

2393
02:25:16.320 --> 02:25:20.190
It does something weird to equilibrium,
right?
Yeah.
If you,

2394
02:25:20.220 --> 02:25:24.690
if you look at um,
my Naco it against a pile and Safra name,

2395
02:25:24.960 --> 02:25:28.640
it was pretty much similar.
I finished them,
I got um,

2396
02:25:28.810 --> 02:25:32.810
the mom four points and I would give them shots to the temple,
um,

2397
02:25:32.890 --> 02:25:36.970
sitting over top of them and when they both got up,
they did the same thing.

2398
02:25:37.780 --> 02:25:38.980
They would get up and they would think,

2399
02:25:38.981 --> 02:25:42.280
they would find their legs would give out and they keep going back and forth,

2400
02:25:42.281 --> 02:25:44.290
side to side and they have to have a guy hold them up.

2401
02:25:44.680 --> 02:25:49.030
I think there's something to say about that,
that,
that shot,
that impact there.

2402
02:25:49.470 --> 02:25:52.710
<v 2>Yeah.
We were just talking on like someone was talking online,</v>

2403
02:25:52.730 --> 02:25:56.910
we were talking about like what shots hurt guys and what shots don't hurt cause

2404
02:25:56.940 --> 02:25:59.250
there's no rhyme or reason to it.

2405
02:25:59.520 --> 02:26:02.880
Like sometimes you'll see a guy get caught with like a grazing shot to the

2406
02:26:02.881 --> 02:26:04.980
forehead and his legs just give out.

2407
02:26:05.120 --> 02:26:09.980
<v 0>Right?
Yeah.
A Conor McGregor was kind of like that when he knocked on Korea.
Yeah.</v>

2408
02:26:10.020 --> 02:26:13.430
Perfectly.
Yeah.
Can I just like hit him there?

2409
02:26:14.410 --> 02:26:15.880
Interesting.
Okay.

2410
02:26:15.980 --> 02:26:19.800
<v 2>Yeah.
Car Hits fucking hard for that weight class.
It's crazy.</v>

2411
02:26:19.801 --> 02:26:21.500
He hits very hard for that weight class.

2412
02:26:21.530 --> 02:26:26.240
I always wonder if he's going to stay at one 45 or if it becomes too much of a

2413
02:26:26.320 --> 02:26:29.390
struggle to get there.
Yeah.

2414
02:26:29.630 --> 02:26:34.010
Who impresses you these days?
Like I know fighters like Woo Hoo.

2415
02:26:34.011 --> 02:26:35.210
Do you like watching?

2416
02:26:35.500 --> 02:26:40.270
<v 0>Um,
I've been watching a lot of Ronda Rousey or Judah.
I want to get good at that.</v>

2417
02:26:40.580 --> 02:26:44.110
Uh,
Connor's movement,
um,
punching style.

2418
02:26:44.500 --> 02:26:49.270
It's interesting how he keeps his chin up in the air a little bit,
but um,

2419
02:26:49.360 --> 02:26:52.960
his apricots and his movement after that.
Cool.

2420
02:26:53.160 --> 02:26:57.670
He's a very John Jones,
how he mixes things up with,
uh,
you know,

2421
02:26:57.671 --> 02:27:01.660
his elbows and his distance and stuff like that.
Ground and pound.

2422
02:27:01.990 --> 02:27:03.280
John's very creative too.

2423
02:27:03.460 --> 02:27:08.420
<v 2>Like I love that move that he did with Glover where he ranched to shoulder and
a,</v>

2424
02:27:08.421 --> 02:27:10.340
I go,
do you ever done that before?
And he's like,
nope.

2425
02:27:10.400 --> 02:27:13.220
Just kind of made it up on the spot and knew that it was a vulnerable,

2426
02:27:13.400 --> 02:27:16.460
I knew there was something not supposed to do in wrestling and so we just

2427
02:27:16.461 --> 02:27:18.530
realized that glow over had a light under hook,

2428
02:27:18.570 --> 02:27:23.210
just got his forearm behind the elbow and just yank the shit out of it.

2429
02:27:23.540 --> 02:27:26.310
Tore Glover's shoulder up crazy.
Yeah,
yeah,

2430
02:27:26.880 --> 02:27:31.380
<v 0>yeah.
He'd just have to go with the flow,
I guess.
Do you like water like Bruce?</v>

2431
02:27:31.620 --> 02:27:35.340
<v 2>Yes,
exactly.
I find it fascinating when you see a guy,</v>

2432
02:27:35.341 --> 02:27:38.220
like one of the things I'm really fascinated by is,
um,

2433
02:27:38.850 --> 02:27:42.090
Gustafson and rumble Johnson.
Okay.

2434
02:27:42.120 --> 02:27:47.120
Because Rumble Johnson who was a standout at welterweight now fighting 35 pounds

2435
02:27:49.651 --> 02:27:52.940
heavier,
how I fucking,
he's huge.
He just,

2436
02:27:52.941 --> 02:27:55.740
he just died the shit out of himself.

2437
02:27:55.860 --> 02:28:00.860
He's a perfect example of you can cut too much weight and it actually fucks you

2438
02:28:00.901 --> 02:28:04.650
up.
Like the point of diminishing returns.
He had passed that clearly.
Yeah.

2439
02:28:04.950 --> 02:28:08.640
<v 0>Yeah.
I Dunno how he grew so much.
Same with Overeem.</v>

2440
02:28:09.320 --> 02:28:13.950
<v 2>That's great.
Well I know how over him.
I think we know rumbled did it too.</v>

2441
02:28:14.070 --> 02:28:18.520
I don't know.
I mean rumble was always big.
Like when I caught,

2442
02:28:18.540 --> 02:28:22.040
I saw a rumble.
Yeah.
Between fights once and he was two 30 pounds.
Yeah,
you're

2443
02:28:22.040 --> 02:28:24.980
<v 3>right.
You're right.
I did see him in between fights.
He was massive.</v>

2444
02:28:25.070 --> 02:28:28.760
I think he was just incredibly disciplined and dieting and starving himself down

2445
02:28:28.761 --> 02:28:32.900
to 100% worth it at that point.
Bigger guys who carry it fucked him up.

2446
02:28:32.901 --> 02:28:35.900
I mean when he lost a cost check,
he just had enough in the tank.

2447
02:28:35.901 --> 02:28:37.610
It got to a certain point where his body,

2448
02:28:37.760 --> 02:28:40.730
he was good for a certain amount of of effort,

2449
02:28:41.060 --> 02:28:45.490
but his body was so depleted and not saying taking anything away from cost cause

2450
02:28:45.500 --> 02:28:49.580
cost check legitimately beat them.
But your body,
when you,

2451
02:28:49.600 --> 02:28:51.050
you have so much depletion,

2452
02:28:51.080 --> 02:28:54.710
there's a certain point in time where your body is like,
you know what?
It stops.

2453
02:28:54.740 --> 02:28:58.490
There's nothing left.
There's nothing left.
It's just not functioning right.
Right,

2454
02:28:58.491 --> 02:29:02.150
right.
And at light heavyweight,
he's a motherfucker,
man.
Yeah.

2455
02:29:02.180 --> 02:29:06.140
Who'd want to fight like I,
I'd have no interest at fight at one 55 yeah.

2456
02:29:06.230 --> 02:29:09.290
It's zero interest.
So all the guys do it,
man.

2457
02:29:09.800 --> 02:29:11.480
I'd way rather fight bigger guys.

2458
02:29:13.680 --> 02:29:14.513
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

2459
02:29:14.620 --> 02:29:17.460
<v 3>I don't have any interest in losing that much weight.
You look at Frankie,</v>

2460
02:29:17.461 --> 02:29:20.590
I mean Frankie,
for the longest time when he was a lightweight champion,

2461
02:29:20.591 --> 02:29:24.900
he was weighing one 55 fighting 55 yeah.
That's funny.
Yeah.

2462
02:29:24.970 --> 02:29:29.380
He barely cuts to make one 45 he can make one 35 really?
Yeah.
Oh,

2463
02:29:29.381 --> 02:29:33.520
100%.
I guarantee you he can make one 35 yeah.
It wouldn't be fun,

2464
02:29:33.670 --> 02:29:38.520
but he could do it.
Right,
right.
Yeah.
That's cool.
It's,
it was a good decision.

2465
02:29:38.530 --> 02:29:41.760
It moved to a 45 though.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Huh.

2466
02:29:42.190 --> 02:29:44.230
Anybody else that is exciting to you?

2467
02:29:46.080 --> 02:29:46.913
<v 4>Okay.</v>

2468
02:29:48.010 --> 02:29:52.920
<v 3>There always is.
You know,
like,
uh,
I've watched a lot of Bruce Lee.
Did he really?</v>

2469
02:29:52.921 --> 02:29:57.750
Yeah.
Yeah.
I leave my show.
Every fighter does.
Yeah.

2470
02:29:57.840 --> 02:30:02.350
Yeah.
I Dunno.
A lot of older guys too.
I Dunno.

2471
02:30:02.400 --> 02:30:05.250
I'm very random.
The newer guys though,
I like,

2472
02:30:05.280 --> 02:30:08.310
I've been watching Connor and Ron did a lot lately.
I love Ron.

2473
02:30:08.311 --> 02:30:11.040
His arm bar technique.
Yeah.
I think her arm back technique,

2474
02:30:11.041 --> 02:30:14.160
it might be the best I've ever seen.
Yeah.
She's got a great arm.

2475
02:30:14.270 --> 02:30:18.430
<v 2>Her setups and the way she's able to adjust when opponents tried to roll out of</v>

2476
02:30:18.431 --> 02:30:21.370
her or moves,
like as they try to get out of it,

2477
02:30:21.371 --> 02:30:24.580
she just sinks it in tighter and tighter and tighter and she follows them.

2478
02:30:24.581 --> 02:30:28.000
She's so used to attacking with armbars that like,

2479
02:30:28.001 --> 02:30:30.180
she kinda knows what they're going to do before they know what they're going to

2480
02:30:30.190 --> 02:30:33.710
do.
So as they try to defend,
she's like one step ahead of them.
Yeah.

2481
02:30:33.850 --> 02:30:35.260
Tightening it up even further.

2482
02:30:35.850 --> 02:30:40.410
<v 3>Jordan Burroughs,
I watched a lot of him to wrestling,</v>

2483
02:30:40.650 --> 02:30:45.360
you know.
Yes.
No,
Jordan Burroughs,
um,
great American wrestler.

2484
02:30:45.750 --> 02:30:50.750
I think he won the Olympics and world championships a great explosive double,

2485
02:30:51.481 --> 02:30:55.830
probably one of the best double eggs around.
Interesting.

2486
02:30:56.040 --> 02:30:57.300
Interesting,
interesting style.

2487
02:30:57.360 --> 02:31:01.470
He watching him and hearing about a lot of his techniques helped me a lot in my

2488
02:31:01.471 --> 02:31:02.050
wrestling.

2489
02:31:02.050 --> 02:31:04.540
<v 2>Well George was really interesting and his wrestling approach,</v>

2490
02:31:04.541 --> 02:31:05.910
because he didn't wrestle in high school,

2491
02:31:05.930 --> 02:31:10.180
did wrestling college and trained a lot of Russian nationals up there in

2492
02:31:10.181 --> 02:31:11.014
Montreal.
Right?

2493
02:31:11.320 --> 02:31:14.790
<v 3>Yeah.
He trained with,
yeah.
The,
the,
the Montreal team.
Yeah.</v>

2494
02:31:15.280 --> 02:31:19.770
Is there a lot of high real high level wrestling up there?
Uh,

2495
02:31:19.920 --> 02:31:20.600
yeah.

2496
02:31:20.600 --> 02:31:24.840
<v 0>I,
I'd say I like,
um,
you know,
[inaudible] I can't,</v>

2497
02:31:25.010 --> 02:31:29.240
I never able to say his last name.
[inaudible] sorry man.

2498
02:31:29.880 --> 02:31:34.260
I don't know.
He's a world champ and I think Olympic silver medalist,

2499
02:31:35.040 --> 02:31:39.480
he's a super technical,
he's helped me a lot with the wrestling.

2500
02:31:39.481 --> 02:31:43.860
I think he's helped George a lot.
Um,
yeah,
there's a lot of,

2501
02:31:43.890 --> 02:31:45.060
there's a lot of good wrestlers there

2502
02:31:45.190 --> 02:31:49.070
<v 2>and is us bring guys like that in,
does he have like wrestling classes?
Yeah,</v>

2503
02:31:49.430 --> 02:31:54.170
<v 0>yeah.
Kia comes in and there's also some other wrestlers that come in and uh,</v>

2504
02:31:54.171 --> 02:31:58.250
there's,
uh,
some Greco guys that come in now.
Yeah.

2505
02:31:58.920 --> 02:32:01.800
<v 2>Well,
it's just such an amazing sport.
I love MMA.</v>

2506
02:32:01.830 --> 02:32:05.130
I just love that there's so much variation.
There's so many,

2507
02:32:05.400 --> 02:32:06.990
so many variables to consider,

2508
02:32:06.991 --> 02:32:09.330
the so many different options and different approaches.

2509
02:32:09.570 --> 02:32:12.300
It's just constantly exciting and interesting to me,
you know,

2510
02:32:12.890 --> 02:32:14.430
and so much to learn there is,

2511
02:32:14.431 --> 02:32:18.090
and I love that this guy's like you man that are out there.
You're on the edge.

2512
02:32:18.091 --> 02:32:18.781
You know,
you're,

2513
02:32:18.781 --> 02:32:22.330
you're constantly pushing it and just really fun to watch a fight,
man.
Thanks.

2514
02:32:22.350 --> 02:32:25.380
I really appreciate it.
I really appreciate you coming on here too.
It's fun.

2515
02:32:25.530 --> 02:32:29.880
Good conversation.
Thanks for the plug at the beginning podcast.
Check it out.

2516
02:32:30.330 --> 02:32:33.320
That's Rory Macdonald.
And if people want to follow you on Twitter,

2517
02:32:33.330 --> 02:32:38.310
what is your Twitter?
It's Rory Macdonald.

2518
02:32:38.970 --> 02:32:43.470
Macdonald.
Not Mc.
It's Mac.
Yeah.
You don't want some dude out?
They're faking it.

2519
02:32:43.471 --> 02:32:46.860
It's just some dude out there pretending to be you,
sandy buddy.
Oh yeah.

2520
02:32:46.920 --> 02:32:48.630
I'm sure all that.

2521
02:32:48.631 --> 02:32:51.310
So the other thing I wanted to talk to you about before we leave the music

2522
02:32:51.330 --> 02:32:53.460
fucking music,
the walking music,

2523
02:32:53.910 --> 02:32:57.660
we've talked about this on the podcast is a great story.

2524
02:32:58.170 --> 02:33:01.830
You changed your phone number and the UFC did know that you had a new phone

2525
02:33:01.831 --> 02:33:02.041
number.

2526
02:33:02.041 --> 02:33:07.041
So they were texting your old phone number and some other dude who got your

2527
02:33:07.681 --> 02:33:11.460
number,
who was a fan was he was picking your walking music.

2528
02:33:11.461 --> 02:33:12.380
So when I moved from [inaudible]

2529
02:33:12.440 --> 02:33:15.620
<v 0>Colona BC,
the small town,
I was doing martial arts,</v>

2530
02:33:15.621 --> 02:33:20.570
that when I finally made the move to Montreal,
I had to switch to that,
the area,

2531
02:33:20.571 --> 02:33:21.530
right?
The phone number.

2532
02:33:22.010 --> 02:33:27.010
So my old phone number went to this random guy in Colona and uh,

2533
02:33:27.741 --> 02:33:32.360
apparently he was a fan of me.
And uh,
um,
Jason,

2534
02:33:32.361 --> 02:33:37.250
the guy,
uh,
at UFC who is asking for my entrance music just had my old number.

2535
02:33:37.790 --> 02:33:41.660
And uh,
and so this guy was,
he was like,
hey Roy,
what's a,

2536
02:33:41.661 --> 02:33:44.480
would entrance music do you want for the next fight?
And this guy was like,

2537
02:33:44.540 --> 02:33:48.080
just picked up on it was like,
hmm,
pretending to be me.

2538
02:33:48.081 --> 02:33:50.900
And so he kept giving him my entrance music.

2539
02:33:50.901 --> 02:33:54.140
So for the longest time I kept walking out to the most random,

2540
02:33:56.560 --> 02:34:01.500
<v 2>the best one was the MC Hammer.
You made fun of me.
He was like,
this shit's</v>

2541
02:34:03.410 --> 02:34:06.220
terrible.
It's all you.
Yeah,
he made fun of me for that.
What would you fight?

2542
02:34:06.221 --> 02:34:07.450
Who was it that you liked?
Paul,

2543
02:34:07.510 --> 02:34:11.560
Mike Pyle and Mike Pyle came out to some classic songs.
A rocky.

2544
02:34:11.590 --> 02:34:14.560
It was because it was in Philly.
We fought in Philly.
Oh,
that's right.

2545
02:34:14.710 --> 02:34:17.920
So I said it was classic and then Mike Goldberg was like,

2546
02:34:17.921 --> 02:34:20.260
well this is classic too.
I go,
yeah,
but this song sucks.

2547
02:34:21.190 --> 02:34:25.240
Which is kind of a bummer cause I saw MC hammer after I said that,

2548
02:34:25.660 --> 02:34:28.780
I saw him like a couple of fights later and he came up to me and said,
I'm like,

2549
02:34:28.810 --> 02:34:33.550
Huh,
I feel bad now.
I said,
your song sucks.
So I'm back in the day.
But

2550
02:34:34.050 --> 02:34:36.510
<v 0>yeah,
I mean it's not my kind of music,</v>

2551
02:34:36.511 --> 02:34:41.160
but some people like it and apparently this certain fan enjoyed the song.

2552
02:34:41.190 --> 02:34:42.540
I thought I would enjoy it too.

2553
02:34:42.610 --> 02:34:44.230
<v 2>Which songs did you choose?</v>

2554
02:34:44.231 --> 02:34:48.910
Here's some songs you had a Metallica seek and destroy me.
Rihanna is me.

2555
02:34:49.000 --> 02:34:53.170
Okay.
So you picked those all the way up to Mc Hammer,

2556
02:34:53.440 --> 02:34:57.460
Mc Hammer.
Did you pick up,
uh,
did you know Tupac and Biggie?

2557
02:34:57.520 --> 02:35:01.540
<v 0>Was that you?
That was me.
That was you.
That was the one probably where I,</v>

2558
02:35:01.840 --> 02:35:06.700
I caught onto it.
So Mc Hammer was the catalyst.
Yeah,

2559
02:35:06.701 --> 02:35:11.470
it was the last one.
So that was the last that guy picked.
And the one I,

2560
02:35:11.620 --> 02:35:15.520
I,
uh,
the Tupac and Biggie Song.
Yeah,

2561
02:35:16.810 --> 02:35:17.650
that was a,

2562
02:35:17.651 --> 02:35:21.880
when I fought Shane mills and Jason came up to me and he's like,

2563
02:35:21.970 --> 02:35:26.620
and it would've continued on if this didn't happen.
He comes up to me in person.

2564
02:35:26.621 --> 02:35:31.540
I was like,
oh,
sorry,
Roy,
um,
we can't get the rights to that song.
Um,

2565
02:35:31.990 --> 02:35:36.520
whatever it was.
It was like a Nickelback song
and

2566
02:35:39.500 --> 02:35:42.460
yeah,
so it was like,
what are you talking about?

2567
02:35:45.360 --> 02:35:49.510
And uh,
he was like,
yeah,
you go,
you asked you,
I texted you,

2568
02:35:49.511 --> 02:35:52.060
you told me this song.
I'm like,
dude,
I never texted you or anything.

2569
02:35:52.061 --> 02:35:56.470
And we started arguing like,
he's like,
yes,
you did.
And I'm like,
no,
I didn't man.

2570
02:35:57.340 --> 02:36:00.280
And I'm like,
pull up your phone.
Let's see it.

2571
02:36:00.670 --> 02:36:03.730
So he takes his phone out and he's like,
look,
he said it right here.
I'm like,

2572
02:36:03.820 --> 02:36:06.690
what number is this going to the contact,

2573
02:36:06.691 --> 02:36:10.510
see what number is it was my old number.
I was like,
dude,
this is not my number,

2574
02:36:10.540 --> 02:36:11.320
man.
Paul,
your

2575
02:36:11.320 --> 02:36:13.960
<v 2>old number and talk to them.
Oh,
I should have though.
Fuck yeah,</v>

2576
02:36:13.961 --> 02:36:17.200
we should call him right now.
We should.
Does he still have it?

2577
02:36:17.470 --> 02:36:21.730
What is my El Norte?
82 still bombed on.

2578
02:36:22.870 --> 02:36:25.660
We should call him.
Call him after the show.
We don't want to fuck with that dude.

2579
02:36:25.750 --> 02:36:29.490
I got to figure out my old number.
Old.
Just text Jason.

2580
02:36:29.500 --> 02:36:33.970
Ask him if he's still might've deleted it.
All right.
Anyway.

2581
02:36:34.090 --> 02:36:37.660
Oh No,
I remember that number.
You got it?
Yeah.
Okay.
We'll call it afterwards.

2582
02:36:37.690 --> 02:36:41.200
Rory underscore Mac Mac Donald's.

2583
02:36:41.710 --> 02:36:44.500
Follow him on Twitter.
When's your next fight scheduled?

2584
02:36:44.560 --> 02:36:47.640
You're waiting while you're waiting for the title fight after title fights over.

2585
02:36:47.660 --> 02:36:50.320
You get to Johnny.
Johnny Hendricks Fighting Robbie Lawler.

2586
02:36:50.321 --> 02:36:55.270
December 6th two weeks from now.
The winner of that fights me.
Beautiful.

2587
02:36:55.271 --> 02:36:59.140
On a date to be disappointed,
hopefully in Canada,
right?
They,

2588
02:36:59.141 --> 02:37:03.940
Dana said it's for sure in Canada.
Oh,
wow.
So will that be in Toronto or Montreal?

2589
02:37:04.150 --> 02:37:08.690
Toronto.
Calgary,
Montreal,
Vancouver.
Right.

2590
02:37:08.800 --> 02:37:13.450
There's a lot of spots for you.
Wow.
Listen man,
there's a lot of fun.
Yeah,
it was.

2591
02:37:13.480 --> 02:37:16.430
And uh,
I really appreciate you doing it and I appreciate your style.

2592
02:37:16.431 --> 02:37:19.640
Love watching you fight.
I'm a big fan.
Thank you,
sir.
This is cool for me,

2593
02:37:19.940 --> 02:37:21.650
Rory Macdonald.
Ladies and gentlemen.
All right,

2594
02:37:21.651 --> 02:37:26.630
we'll be back tomorrow with Lewis from unbox therapy.
Until then.
Take care.

2595
02:37:26.720 --> 02:37:27.590
Bye.
Bye.
Big Kiss.
